1
00:01:12,834 --> 00:01:14,292
And now, friends.

2
00:01:14,376 --> 00:01:16,667
It's an honor to
introduce to all of you..

3
00:01:16,834 --> 00:01:18,334
...the nation's heart-throb.

4
00:01:18,667 --> 00:01:20,042
The one and only.

5
00:01:20,251 --> 00:01:26,167
Singer, music-composer,
and song-writer.. Rahul Jayekar.

6
00:01:26,376 --> 00:01:29,334
We're bringing you live
updates about this concert.

7
00:01:29,417 --> 00:01:32,376
As you can see, the ambiance
is ready, the stage is set.

8
00:01:32,542 --> 00:01:34,167
And the fans have
been waiting for..

9
00:01:34,251 --> 00:01:35,959
...Rahul Jayekar for
the past two hours.

10
00:01:41,209 --> 00:01:43,209
Mr. Deepak. He won't make it.

11
00:01:43,417 --> 00:01:45,251
I am Aryan. I'm a singer too.

12
00:01:45,334 --> 00:01:47,667
Ohh! Get lost!
- Let me go on the stage.

13
00:01:47,876 --> 00:01:49,251
Sir. Listen to me.

14
00:01:49,334 --> 00:01:50,334
Sir, I've been struggling
for five years..

15
00:01:50,417 --> 00:01:51,292
...all thanks to people like these.

16
00:01:51,376 --> 00:01:52,709
Sir, I am ready.
Take me in, please.

17
00:01:54,001 --> 00:01:55,876
Struggle for 10 more years.

18
00:01:56,001 --> 00:01:57,292
Turn authentic.

19
00:01:57,376 --> 00:01:59,209
And if I'm still alive,
you can come meet me.

20
00:01:59,292 --> 00:02:00,751
Okay. Get lost now.

21
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:03,001
Hello. Where's Vivek..

22
00:02:03,042 --> 00:02:05,251
Vivek! Vivek!

23
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:07,251
Tell me honestly..

24
00:02:07,334 --> 00:02:09,292
...am I going to have a show or not?

25
00:02:10,001 --> 00:02:12,751
Please. Get this show
done for the last time.

26
00:02:13,001 --> 00:02:15,959
That announcer's
tired of announcing..

27
00:02:16,001 --> 00:02:17,292
...sir's arrival on stage.

28
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:18,959
"He's coming now!"

29
00:02:19,042 --> 00:02:20,751
"He's on his way!"

30
00:02:21,084 --> 00:02:23,376
Please. Don't ruin my show.

31
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:29,459
Rahul.

32
00:02:31,626 --> 00:02:32,917
Time to go on stage.

33
00:02:35,751 --> 00:02:37,334
What's the problem, Vivek?

34
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:39,042
They paid me for this.

35
00:02:39,542 --> 00:02:40,876
I'm here to sing.

36
00:02:41,167 --> 00:02:43,167
And I won't leave without singing.

37
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:49,709
In fact, those who expect nothing..

38
00:02:50,584 --> 00:02:52,709
...are the more responsible ones.

39
00:02:55,417 --> 00:02:56,417
Let's go.

40
00:02:58,167 --> 00:03:01,001
After countless album songs,
and live concerts..

41
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:07,042
If anyone tries to create a scene,
just ignore him.

42
00:03:07,834 --> 00:03:09,126
If anything goes wrong..

43
00:03:09,292 --> 00:03:10,834
...the security here will handle it.

44
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:11,959
Listen.

45
00:03:12,917 --> 00:03:14,501
Just control yourself.

46
00:03:16,834 --> 00:03:20,126
RJ! RJ! RJ!

47
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:21,542
Ask the boys to be ready.

48
00:03:22,626 --> 00:03:25,126
We're going to give them a show.
- Your wait's over.

49
00:03:25,626 --> 00:03:28,626
And we're going to call on stage..

50
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,251
...your favorite, RJ.

51
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:35,709
That is, Rahul Jayekar.

52
00:04:05,126 --> 00:04:14,417
"Bless me with your grace."

53
00:04:51,126 --> 00:04:53,792
"Give me thoughts."

54
00:04:54,126 --> 00:04:56,626
"Give me oaths and promises."

55
00:04:57,001 --> 00:05:02,542
"Give directions to my prayers."

56
00:05:02,876 --> 00:05:05,417
"Give my heart refuge."

57
00:05:05,751 --> 00:05:08,334
"Give me new reasons."

58
00:05:08,751 --> 00:05:14,501
"Give my dreams wings to fly."

59
00:05:15,334 --> 00:05:20,542
"Bless me with your grace."

60
00:05:21,209 --> 00:05:25,751
"Take a look at me as well."

61
00:05:25,876 --> 00:05:30,667
"Are you listening?"

62
00:05:31,751 --> 00:05:37,042
III am crying-"

63
00:05:37,667 --> 00:05:42,292
"Are you listening?"

64
00:05:42,417 --> 00:05:47,417
"Why I am crying.".

65
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:55,459
He's drunk! RJ!

66
00:06:28,001 --> 00:06:33,001
"Destiny's are lost."

67
00:06:34,084 --> 00:06:39,167
"The path's forlorn."

68
00:06:39,917 --> 00:06:45,084
"Come and take me away."

69
00:06:45,667 --> 00:06:50,626
"That's all I pray for."

70
00:06:51,167 --> 00:06:56,876
"it's your safekeeping."

71
00:06:57,084 --> 00:07:04,251
"You belong to me."

72
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:12,042
"Bless me with your grace."

73
00:07:12,417 --> 00:07:17,001
"Take a look at me as well."

74
00:07:17,084 --> 00:07:21,792
"Are you listening?"

75
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:28,167
III am crying-"

76
00:07:28,751 --> 00:07:34,751
"Are you listening?"

77
00:07:40,792 --> 00:07:41,834
RJ!

78
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:49,001
Come, come.

79
00:07:59,042 --> 00:08:00,501
What are you waiting for?
Get the camera.

80
00:08:00,876 --> 00:08:01,959
Hurry UP-

81
00:08:02,042 --> 00:08:03,209
Take the shot!

82
00:08:07,251 --> 00:08:09,126
Get up. - Rahul, leave.

83
00:08:10,376 --> 00:08:13,001
You have ruined me.
I won't spare you, RJ.

84
00:08:13,042 --> 00:08:14,042
Rahul, let be.

85
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:16,001
Get out.

86
00:08:17,042 --> 00:08:20,792
I don't want security.
I don't want it.

87
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,667
Wait.

88
00:08:23,792 --> 00:08:27,167
Let's go - Yes sir.

89
00:08:28,084 --> 00:08:31,084
I know, these things
happen in cheap shows.

90
00:08:31,334 --> 00:08:32,167
Anyway-

91
00:08:32,251 --> 00:08:33,626
We'll discuss this
back at the hotel.

92
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:39,084
I want to stay alone!

93
00:08:39,709 --> 00:08:41,042
Go somewhere far away.

94
00:08:41,126 --> 00:08:43,001
But, do you have a
problem if I come with you?

95
00:08:43,167 --> 00:08:44,501
No, there's no problem.

96
00:08:44,584 --> 00:08:47,334
I just want to go away
from this commotion. - What?

97
00:08:48,126 --> 00:08:50,084
There's not much
of commotion left now.

98
00:08:52,334 --> 00:08:53,542
It's almost over, Rahul.

99
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,501
After doing shows at London,
New York, Australia..

100
00:08:59,167 --> 00:09:00,542
...now you don't have work.

101
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,001
No one wants to work with you.

102
00:09:06,876 --> 00:09:09,667
Music directors. Film industry,
stage shows, pop albums.

103
00:09:09,751 --> 00:09:10,834
You've nothing.

104
00:09:12,501 --> 00:09:16,292
No one's going to support
a drunk artist for too long.

105
00:09:17,876 --> 00:09:19,459
No one's going to tolerate that.

106
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:22,792
And now, it's come to this..

107
00:09:22,876 --> 00:09:24,792
...that we've to perform
in small cities.

108
00:09:25,542 --> 00:09:29,001
And pardon me;
this is what happens in such shows.

109
00:09:30,042 --> 00:09:32,084
There's a lot that
happens in my heart too.

110
00:09:32,876 --> 00:09:34,376
So what? - Nothing.

111
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,292
Just stop drinking.

112
00:09:38,376 --> 00:09:40,001
We haven't lost anything yet.

113
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:42,834
You were a star yesterday.

114
00:09:43,001 --> 00:09:45,292
And you still are.
- Are you finished?

115
00:09:45,834 --> 00:09:46,834
Can I go?

116
00:09:48,834 --> 00:09:49,959
Yeah, go on.

117
00:09:50,501 --> 00:09:51,667
But, this isn't Mumbai.

118
00:09:51,917 --> 00:09:53,042
Sir your car.

119
00:09:55,501 --> 00:09:56,542
Where will you go?

120
00:09:56,667 --> 00:09:57,959
In this strange city?

121
00:10:00,042 --> 00:10:02,459
If you meet with an accident
in this state, you'll end up dead.

122
00:10:03,084 --> 00:10:05,292
You know me well, Vivek.

123
00:10:07,042 --> 00:10:08,709
I don't drink to die.

124
00:10:09,292 --> 00:10:10,626
But, I would die for a drink.

125
00:10:12,084 --> 00:10:15,376
So see you, Vivek. - Rahul.

126
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:31,709
"The time's standing still."

127
00:10:32,834 --> 00:10:37,584
"How did this happen."

128
00:10:38,667 --> 00:10:43,792
"I want you to come in my life."

129
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:49,834
"Like a wish comes true."

130
00:10:50,001 --> 00:10:55,501
"You're the satisfaction
of my soul."

131
00:10:55,876 --> 00:10:59,959
"You're my faith."

132
00:11:00,001 --> 00:11:04,209
And this award
goes to Rahul Jaykar!

133
00:11:05,334 --> 00:11:10,584
"Bless me with your grace."

134
00:11:11,251 --> 00:11:15,876
"Take a look at me as well."

135
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:19,167
Rahul Jaykar has been honored
with the best male singer award.

136
00:11:19,251 --> 00:11:22,042
RJ the most popular Indian singer.

137
00:11:23,042 --> 00:11:28,084
RJ's new song is super hit.

138
00:11:30,751 --> 00:11:35,334
RJ! RJ! RJ!

139
00:11:35,417 --> 00:11:39,334
RJ! RJ! RJ!

140
00:11:39,417 --> 00:11:44,584
"Are you listening?"

141
00:11:45,209 --> 00:11:49,667
III am crying-"

142
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:55,042
"Are you listening?"

143
00:11:55,876 --> 00:11:59,584
III am crying-"

144
00:11:59,792 --> 00:12:04,959
"You are listening, aren't you?"

145
00:12:05,542 --> 00:12:10,917
III am crying-"

146
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:16,251
"You are listening, aren't you?"

147
00:12:16,334 --> 00:12:24,001
III am crying-"

148
00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:44,001
Oh no!

149
00:12:45,542 --> 00:12:46,709
Sorry!
Are you Okay?

150
00:12:47,126 --> 00:12:48,167
What okay?

151
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:49,584
It's a sunny day, right?

152
00:12:49,834 --> 00:12:51,876
So, you're driving
with your goggles.

153
00:12:52,334 --> 00:12:54,292
You made me drop
all the vegetables.

154
00:12:54,459 --> 00:12:57,251
I just lost 86 rupees. - 86 rupees.

155
00:13:02,209 --> 00:13:06,376
It's a lot of money.
- What are you looking at?

156
00:13:07,459 --> 00:13:09,542
Pick up the remaining tomatoes.
Come on.

157
00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:10,709
Yes.

158
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,792
Three were crushed under the car.

159
00:13:19,001 --> 00:13:23,334
I'll send you the money.
Give me your address.

160
00:13:24,084 --> 00:13:28,042
No. You should be taught a lesson.

161
00:13:28,751 --> 00:13:29,751
Bend down.

162
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:32,459
Bend down!
And pick them all up.

163
00:13:33,626 --> 00:13:34,626
Sorry.

164
00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:51,501
They are spoilt now.

165
00:14:01,501 --> 00:14:02,501
Forget it.

166
00:14:06,834 --> 00:14:07,917
I am sorry Ms..

167
00:14:08,001 --> 00:14:09,876
That was two days ration.

168
00:14:10,626 --> 00:14:11,792
You ruined it.

169
00:14:31,542 --> 00:14:33,542
Make me a large.
- The bar's closed.

170
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,542
Make me a drink. - The bar's..

171
00:14:39,542 --> 00:14:40,959
Mr. RJ sir, you!

172
00:14:41,876 --> 00:14:44,042
Sir, I'm a big fan.

173
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:45,792
Make me a drink.

174
00:14:46,126 --> 00:14:48,167
Sir. - I'm okay.

175
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:49,959
Make me a drink.

176
00:14:50,167 --> 00:14:53,126
I am sorry, sir.
But the bar's closed.

177
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:55,167
The owner's father
passed away, so..

178
00:14:56,584 --> 00:14:57,792
Father's dead.

179
00:14:59,376 --> 00:15:00,792
So, where can I get a drink?

180
00:15:01,042 --> 00:15:03,042
Sir, I can give you
drink mixed with coke.

181
00:15:03,417 --> 00:15:05,542
No one will know.

182
00:15:07,084 --> 00:15:08,292
Forget it.

183
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:11,959
Someone's father is dead.
Why cheat.

184
00:15:14,501 --> 00:15:16,001
Then, can you tell
me if there's a bar around.

185
00:15:16,251 --> 00:15:17,251
I'll be grateful.

186
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:19,001
Bar?

187
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:22,334
Oh yes, there's a beer
bar just a few paces ahead.

188
00:15:23,042 --> 00:15:24,376
It stays open until 2 o'clock.

189
00:15:24,459 --> 00:15:27,209
But, that place
isn't your standards.

190
00:15:28,834 --> 00:15:30,459
I'm not up to my standards, either.

191
00:15:30,792 --> 00:15:31,792
What?

192
00:15:34,542 --> 00:15:35,709
Nothing.

193
00:15:36,709 --> 00:15:37,709
Thank you.

194
00:15:39,792 --> 00:15:45,501
"Destiny's are lost."

195
00:15:45,667 --> 00:15:50,792
"The path's forlorn."

196
00:15:51,542 --> 00:15:56,917
"Come and take me away."

197
00:15:57,334 --> 00:16:02,001
"That's all I pray for."

198
00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:08,251
"it's your safekeeping."

199
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:14,542
"You belong to me."

200
00:16:20,292 --> 00:16:23,042
"Give me thoughts."

201
00:16:23,251 --> 00:16:25,792
"Give me oaths and promises."

202
00:16:26,084 --> 00:16:31,834
"Give directions to my prayers."

203
00:16:32,042 --> 00:16:34,709
"Give my heart refuge."

204
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,376
"Give me new reasons."

205
00:16:38,001 --> 00:16:43,667
"Give my dreams wings to fly."

206
00:16:44,501 --> 00:16:50,001
"Bless me with your grace."

207
00:16:50,334 --> 00:16:54,751
"Take a look at me as well."

208
00:16:55,001 --> 00:16:59,584
"Are you listening?"

209
00:17:00,876 --> 00:17:05,626
III am crying-"

210
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:11,126
"Are you listening?"

211
00:17:11,501 --> 00:17:16,334
"Why I am crying.".

212
00:17:29,334 --> 00:17:30,667
Keep this inside.

213
00:17:30,876 --> 00:17:32,751
What are you doing?
- He's here.

214
00:17:33,584 --> 00:17:35,084
Who? - Don't know.

215
00:17:35,792 --> 00:17:37,251
He was drunk and driving.

216
00:17:37,542 --> 00:17:39,417
I barely managed to escape.

217
00:17:40,709 --> 00:17:43,126
He's no-good.
Just enjoying for free.

218
00:17:43,292 --> 00:17:44,709
Don't look at him.

219
00:17:45,542 --> 00:17:47,126
Forget it. The manager's watching.

220
00:17:49,292 --> 00:17:50,667
Go on.

221
00:18:01,626 --> 00:18:07,167
"The time's standing still."

222
00:18:07,584 --> 00:18:12,334
"How did this happen."

223
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:18,834
"I want you came in my life."

224
00:18:19,292 --> 00:18:24,042
"Like a wish comes true."

225
00:18:24,792 --> 00:18:30,251
"You're the satisfaction
of my soul."

226
00:18:30,626 --> 00:18:36,417
"You're my faith."

227
00:18:40,126 --> 00:18:45,626
"Bless me with your grace."

228
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:50,501
"Take a look at me as well."

229
00:18:50,626 --> 00:18:55,126
"Are you listening?"

230
00:18:56,417 --> 00:19:00,834
III am crying-"

231
00:19:02,292 --> 00:19:06,751
"Are you listening?"

232
00:19:07,167 --> 00:19:12,501
"Why I am crying.".

233
00:19:29,917 --> 00:19:31,376
Salim, he's right here.

234
00:19:31,542 --> 00:19:32,584
I'm going to yell at him.

235
00:19:32,667 --> 00:19:34,501
He's coming, isn't here?
He's here, right?

236
00:19:35,251 --> 00:19:36,501
Look, I..

237
00:19:37,251 --> 00:19:38,917
Hello. - Hello, sir..

238
00:19:39,001 --> 00:19:41,501
RJ. - Yes.

239
00:19:41,751 --> 00:19:44,709
Rahul... Jayekar! - Yes.

240
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:48,501
This song.. - You, at our hotel?

241
00:19:49,709 --> 00:19:54,417
And, I was singing your song. - No.

242
00:19:54,667 --> 00:19:57,501
Salil. I said such rubbish.

243
00:19:57,584 --> 00:20:00,251
I want to talk to you.
- Sir, sorry..

244
00:20:00,459 --> 00:20:02,584
Sit. - And,
I made you do such stupid things.

245
00:20:02,876 --> 00:20:05,334
Pick up vegetables..
- Be quiet for a minute.

246
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:11,126
What's your name?

247
00:20:12,292 --> 00:20:14,084
Aarohi Keshav Shirke.

248
00:20:15,042 --> 00:20:16,042
Aarohi.

249
00:20:18,459 --> 00:20:21,751
You've a great voice.
- No, I was just..

250
00:20:21,876 --> 00:20:23,751
Just listen.

251
00:20:25,667 --> 00:20:26,667
Yes.

252
00:20:27,417 --> 00:20:29,542
You sung my song better than me.

253
00:20:32,376 --> 00:20:34,501
I just realized my flaws.

254
00:20:35,917 --> 00:20:38,251
The mistakes I made in my songs.

255
00:20:39,709 --> 00:20:42,876
I never felt any
of my song like this.

256
00:20:43,584 --> 00:20:45,209
You're joking.

257
00:20:46,251 --> 00:20:47,251
No.

258
00:20:48,376 --> 00:20:51,001
I never joke when concerns singing.

259
00:20:54,084 --> 00:20:56,001
Rahul! Rahul!

260
00:20:56,751 --> 00:20:57,876
Are you mad?

261
00:20:58,042 --> 00:21:00,001
I found your car crashed,
in the middle of the road.

262
00:21:00,209 --> 00:21:02,084
Whether you're dead or alive,
you could've have..

263
00:21:03,167 --> 00:21:04,667
What are you doing here?

264
00:21:05,251 --> 00:21:06,042
Let's go.

265
00:21:06,084 --> 00:21:07,126
Let's go from here.

266
00:21:07,751 --> 00:21:10,084
Rahul, let's go.
- Don't go, Aarohi.

267
00:21:11,292 --> 00:21:12,042
Let's go.

268
00:21:12,084 --> 00:21:13,167
Let's leave.

269
00:21:13,709 --> 00:21:15,334
He's a drunkard.

270
00:21:15,751 --> 00:21:18,876
He was just trying
to convince her..

271
00:21:19,001 --> 00:21:19,834
Yes, let's go.

272
00:21:19,917 --> 00:21:22,626
Is 1 am. And,
the police can raid any moment.

273
00:21:22,709 --> 00:21:24,584
But, he's such a big artist.

274
00:21:25,001 --> 00:21:26,167
If we leave..

275
00:21:26,626 --> 00:21:28,709
He won't know. Let's go.

276
00:21:28,834 --> 00:21:31,001
Deepak's looking all over for you.

277
00:21:31,501 --> 00:21:33,584
We've four more shows to do.
If this continues..

278
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:35,792
...we'll have to
return all the money.

279
00:21:35,959 --> 00:21:37,751
We will return the money, Vivek.

280
00:21:37,959 --> 00:21:39,584
What are you saying Rahul?

281
00:21:39,751 --> 00:21:42,626
Listen. I've to go
back to Mumbai tomorrow.

282
00:21:43,376 --> 00:21:47,042
This singer, Aarohi.. - Who?

283
00:21:47,251 --> 00:21:48,084
Where's everyone?

284
00:21:48,167 --> 00:21:49,042
Forget it, let's go.

285
00:21:49,084 --> 00:21:51,584
Rahul, let's go. - Wait.

286
00:21:52,084 --> 00:21:55,334
Where's everyone? - They all left.

287
00:21:58,334 --> 00:22:00,084
I want that girl's address.

288
00:22:00,167 --> 00:22:01,959
Where does she stay? - Kolhapanaji!

289
00:22:02,209 --> 00:22:04,292
I'm going- - What?

290
00:22:04,626 --> 00:22:05,917
Give me the car keys.

291
00:22:06,084 --> 00:22:07,376
What are you doing? - Give it.

292
00:22:07,876 --> 00:22:09,126
What's going on?

293
00:22:09,876 --> 00:22:12,209
What are you doing?
- Pay for the whiskey.

294
00:22:12,292 --> 00:22:13,292
Rahul!

295
00:22:14,126 --> 00:22:15,751
Rahul! How will I go home?

296
00:22:31,959 --> 00:22:34,584
'You've a great voice.'

297
00:22:36,792 --> 00:22:39,001
'You sung my song better than me.'

298
00:22:46,126 --> 00:22:48,001
'l just realized my flaws.'

299
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:51,542
'The mistakes I made in my songs.'

300
00:22:52,584 --> 00:22:55,834
'l never felt any
of my song like this.'

301
00:23:08,167 --> 00:23:09,167
Aarohi!

302
00:23:13,084 --> 00:23:14,084
Aarohi!

303
00:23:19,126 --> 00:23:20,126
Aarohi!

304
00:23:22,209 --> 00:23:23,209
Aarohi!

305
00:23:24,126 --> 00:23:26,167
Hi. - Oh, God!

306
00:23:26,376 --> 00:23:29,001
I want to talk to you, come down.

307
00:23:30,417 --> 00:23:31,417
Come down.

308
00:23:32,584 --> 00:23:34,626
I can't come. - Fine, I'm coming.

309
00:23:36,376 --> 00:23:41,084
No. no. no. - What?

310
00:23:45,417 --> 00:23:47,209
I'm coming. - Come down.

311
00:24:22,042 --> 00:24:23,167
What are you doing?

312
00:24:24,251 --> 00:24:26,001
What happened?

313
00:24:26,501 --> 00:24:27,501
Come on.

314
00:24:28,209 --> 00:24:30,959
What happened?

315
00:24:31,917 --> 00:24:32,917
Come here.

316
00:24:33,292 --> 00:24:34,751
What are you doing?

317
00:24:36,834 --> 00:24:39,126
I'm not allowed
to meet anyone here.

318
00:24:39,417 --> 00:24:42,292
If the bar's management sees me..

319
00:24:42,376 --> 00:24:44,751
...he'll deduct a day's salary.
- Sorry.

320
00:24:45,792 --> 00:24:47,584
I had to come.

321
00:24:49,001 --> 00:24:53,001
We couldn't complete
our conversation at the bar..

322
00:24:53,376 --> 00:24:54,376
What?

323
00:24:54,792 --> 00:24:55,792
So...

324
00:24:59,792 --> 00:25:03,501
You want to be a singer?
- Who said that?

325
00:25:03,876 --> 00:25:04,876
You did.

326
00:25:06,667 --> 00:25:09,542
You were looking at Lata's picture.

327
00:25:11,001 --> 00:25:13,292
Just like a child
looks at the moon.

328
00:25:15,001 --> 00:25:16,376
Wants to touch it.

329
00:25:18,459 --> 00:25:21,834
That look told me everything.

330
00:25:24,251 --> 00:25:26,126
Everyone looks at the moon.

331
00:25:28,917 --> 00:25:31,167
What good is that? - The beginning.

332
00:25:32,626 --> 00:25:34,209
Of every successful journey.

333
00:25:35,959 --> 00:25:40,417
You know,
the best artists in the world..

334
00:25:41,709 --> 00:25:44,001
...are the ones who
have their own style.

335
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:47,334
A style,
that doesn't come from imitation.

336
00:25:48,959 --> 00:25:51,042
A style, that's born with them.

337
00:25:53,501 --> 00:25:55,042
And, you've got that.

338
00:25:56,042 --> 00:25:57,459
That special thing.

339
00:25:58,292 --> 00:26:01,667
I wonder what's that thing..

340
00:26:02,626 --> 00:26:04,917
...that you heard,
but the others can't.

341
00:26:05,709 --> 00:26:09,834
I tried really hard.

342
00:26:12,626 --> 00:26:14,542
But, no one gave me a chance.

343
00:26:15,042 --> 00:26:16,417
That's why I am here.

344
00:26:18,709 --> 00:26:20,417
Because,
I want to make you successful.

345
00:26:21,001 --> 00:26:23,459
I want to make you the greatest
singer of this millennium.

346
00:26:26,292 --> 00:26:33,001
Look I... not the
kind of girl you think.

347
00:26:35,417 --> 00:26:38,042
I don't say these
things to those girls.

348
00:26:43,834 --> 00:26:45,126
But, what to do?

349
00:26:46,459 --> 00:26:47,792
I think I am in love.

350
00:26:49,251 --> 00:26:50,709
I've gone crazy.

351
00:26:51,709 --> 00:26:55,917
Now, whether it's the art
or the artist, that's yet to say.

352
00:26:57,834 --> 00:26:58,876
We'll know.

353
00:27:01,292 --> 00:27:03,709
But, only after you're sober.

354
00:27:12,959 --> 00:27:14,376
Listen. - What?

355
00:27:15,001 --> 00:27:16,542
You won't work in that bar.

356
00:27:17,751 --> 00:27:19,167
You'll leave that job.

357
00:27:20,417 --> 00:27:21,792
Because I say so.

358
00:27:26,417 --> 00:27:27,834
Do you believe me?

359
00:27:35,501 --> 00:27:36,501
Listen.

360
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:41,792
What?

361
00:27:43,167 --> 00:27:44,167
Nothing.

362
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:48,959
Just like that.

363
00:28:07,626 --> 00:28:09,167
Aarohi, are you okay?

364
00:28:10,834 --> 00:28:12,959
Yes. I am fine.

365
00:28:21,001 --> 00:28:22,292
25,000!

366
00:28:22,959 --> 00:28:25,834
That's what I spent
to bring you here.

367
00:28:26,459 --> 00:28:30,084
I suggest,
you pay up and you can leave.

368
00:28:33,209 --> 00:28:34,209
What?

369
00:28:34,709 --> 00:28:35,917
Don't have it.

370
00:28:36,542 --> 00:28:37,584
Go.

371
00:28:41,751 --> 00:28:42,876
Shankar sir.

372
00:28:44,959 --> 00:28:46,584
It's the question of my life.

373
00:28:47,209 --> 00:28:48,626
Please let me go.

374
00:28:49,542 --> 00:28:52,042
I'll return your money
once I get to Mumbai.

375
00:28:53,292 --> 00:28:56,417
No one's going to pay
even 200 for this face.

376
00:28:56,959 --> 00:28:58,084
What do you think?

377
00:28:58,167 --> 00:29:00,376
This is no orphanage.

378
00:29:01,167 --> 00:29:03,042
Pay up and leave.

379
00:29:03,501 --> 00:29:05,376
You take up 50 percent.

380
00:29:06,417 --> 00:29:07,709
And, what are we left with?

381
00:29:07,917 --> 00:29:09,959
We've to buy food
with our own money.

382
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:13,126
It'll take me months
to arrange that kind of money.

383
00:29:13,292 --> 00:29:14,584
Yeah! Exactly.

384
00:29:14,667 --> 00:29:18,334
That's why you steal
money from the money-bag.

385
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:20,501
What else do you expect me to do?

386
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:23,334
You cut 100 rupees
for minor mistakes.

387
00:29:23,542 --> 00:29:25,042
200 for coming late.

388
00:29:25,292 --> 00:29:26,959
And my salary.. - Babu!

389
00:29:27,042 --> 00:29:28,709
What's wrong with her?

390
00:29:28,917 --> 00:29:30,834
She's constantly
saying "I want to go".

391
00:29:31,084 --> 00:29:32,292
She was fine until yesterday.

392
00:29:32,751 --> 00:29:34,626
That singer RJ that
came to bar yesterday..

393
00:29:34,709 --> 00:29:36,251
...Is the one that provoked her.

394
00:29:36,334 --> 00:29:37,542
That he'll make her a singer.

395
00:29:37,626 --> 00:29:39,167
Give her a chance to sing in films.

396
00:29:39,501 --> 00:29:41,084
Since then.. - I see.

397
00:29:41,751 --> 00:29:44,209
RJ. That singer.

398
00:29:45,667 --> 00:29:46,876
Just a minute.

399
00:29:48,251 --> 00:29:49,251
Look.

400
00:29:49,459 --> 00:29:51,667
His picture's in the papers.

401
00:29:52,501 --> 00:29:54,834
He had a fight
with a man yesterday.

402
00:29:55,459 --> 00:29:58,542
He left before the show started.

403
00:29:59,126 --> 00:30:01,959
The organizer of the
show was crying on camera.

404
00:30:02,417 --> 00:30:04,167
There are many other
stories about him.

405
00:30:04,417 --> 00:30:05,792
But, no news about his work.

406
00:30:07,876 --> 00:30:09,834
He'll get you work.

407
00:30:11,251 --> 00:30:15,876
A man that's living off
his hit songs of yesteryear..

408
00:30:16,126 --> 00:30:18,959
...can only pass time with you.

409
00:30:19,501 --> 00:30:20,709
Do you know why?

410
00:30:20,876 --> 00:30:22,959
Because you're worth it.

411
00:30:34,626 --> 00:30:37,834
Hello, sir... you..

412
00:30:40,834 --> 00:30:43,126
I am here for this girl..

413
00:30:43,459 --> 00:30:46,209
...because she's going
to a great singer.

414
00:30:47,084 --> 00:30:50,292
But, I can see her future, not you.

415
00:30:52,709 --> 00:30:53,959
One more thing.

416
00:30:55,667 --> 00:30:56,876
You run a bar.

417
00:30:58,042 --> 00:30:59,542
You live off singers.

418
00:31:01,126 --> 00:31:02,876
Learn to respect singers.

419
00:31:04,626 --> 00:31:06,251
Ones that sing at your bar.

420
00:31:07,709 --> 00:31:10,334
And the ones,
whose songs help you run your bar.

421
00:31:11,584 --> 00:31:12,584
Get that.

422
00:31:15,001 --> 00:31:17,376
Vivek, throw the money on his face.

423
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:20,834
He isn't worthy of any respect.

424
00:31:22,917 --> 00:31:24,251
Let's go, Aarohi.

425
00:31:30,501 --> 00:31:32,251
Okay. Goodbye.

426
00:31:34,376 --> 00:31:36,001
What's all this, Rahul?

427
00:31:37,167 --> 00:31:38,292
This is it.

428
00:31:40,334 --> 00:31:42,584
I pray to Allah that
you're never heart-broken.

429
00:31:42,917 --> 00:31:44,709
If that happens, don't hesitate.

430
00:31:45,001 --> 00:31:48,709
I'll get you work,
and won't taunt you either.

431
00:32:04,709 --> 00:32:06,126
No, no, it's fine.

432
00:32:12,376 --> 00:32:13,584
I'll drop you.

433
00:32:14,876 --> 00:32:15,876
No.

434
00:32:16,084 --> 00:32:19,876
The place I stay,
isn't your standards.

435
00:32:26,167 --> 00:32:28,084
I've noted my number, address..

436
00:32:28,167 --> 00:32:29,626
...and my manager's
number in your diary.

437
00:32:29,709 --> 00:32:32,792
So, call me when you get a new sim.

438
00:32:33,042 --> 00:32:34,042
Okay-

439
00:32:34,292 --> 00:32:35,417
Don't forget.

440
00:32:37,917 --> 00:32:40,001
Thank you. - For what?

441
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,209
For giving me new hope.

442
00:32:44,751 --> 00:32:46,042
Bye. - Bye,

443
00:32:58,626 --> 00:32:59,626
Listen.

444
00:33:00,542 --> 00:33:01,542
What?

445
00:33:02,042 --> 00:33:03,042
Nothing.

446
00:33:06,209 --> 00:33:07,459
Just like that.

447
00:33:32,459 --> 00:33:34,084
Father!

448
00:33:35,626 --> 00:33:36,626
Aarohi.

449
00:33:41,042 --> 00:33:42,626
You're back. - Yes.

450
00:33:44,542 --> 00:33:46,917
I was thinking about you. - Really?

451
00:33:47,251 --> 00:33:48,667
I even called you in my dreams.

452
00:33:50,001 --> 00:33:51,917
Your mother yelled at me. - Why?

453
00:33:52,001 --> 00:33:55,126
She called me crazy. - Father.

454
00:33:58,792 --> 00:34:01,126
But, you left for three months,
didn't you?

455
00:34:01,792 --> 00:34:05,376
And in one month..
- I'll tell you everything.

456
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:07,001
But where's mother?

457
00:34:07,167 --> 00:34:08,334
At the station.

458
00:34:08,792 --> 00:34:10,167
Today's Thursday.

459
00:34:10,459 --> 00:34:12,542
She's gone to buy the
Maharashtra Rajya Lottery.

460
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:15,042
She's been buying lottery
tickets for the past two years.

461
00:34:15,126 --> 00:34:17,626
But she's never won anything
more than 100 rupees.

462
00:34:19,084 --> 00:34:20,251
Enough!

463
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:23,792
The daughter's back and
the father can't stop yapping.

464
00:34:24,042 --> 00:34:25,042
Mother.

465
00:34:29,709 --> 00:34:31,417
Why didn't you say you're coming?

466
00:34:31,792 --> 00:34:33,751
I would've prepared
something for you.

467
00:34:34,251 --> 00:34:37,542
We live off on fritters.

468
00:34:39,542 --> 00:34:42,626
But now that you're here,
we'll make something nice.

469
00:34:43,042 --> 00:34:46,042
Give me 100 rupees..

470
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:48,626
...I'll get something
from the market.

471
00:34:49,126 --> 00:34:50,917
We'll make something good today.

472
00:34:54,334 --> 00:34:58,042
Mother, I..

473
00:34:59,001 --> 00:35:01,584
...didn't get paid. - Why?

474
00:35:02,501 --> 00:35:04,126
I met someone.

475
00:35:05,292 --> 00:35:08,584
He said he'll give me a
chance to be a singer, in films.

476
00:35:09,751 --> 00:35:15,542
So I.. - You believed him.
And quit your job.

477
00:35:35,917 --> 00:35:36,917
Mom.

478
00:35:39,126 --> 00:35:40,126
Mom.

479
00:35:41,667 --> 00:35:43,167
Everything will be okay.

480
00:35:43,626 --> 00:35:44,792
Trust..

481
00:35:45,709 --> 00:35:47,376
It's just a matter of few days.

482
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:50,292
Once I start working.. - So?

483
00:35:51,542 --> 00:35:53,167
I only have 300 rupees.

484
00:35:54,042 --> 00:35:55,167
300 rupees..

485
00:35:56,209 --> 00:35:58,001
Your father doesn't earn a penny.

486
00:35:58,542 --> 00:36:02,376
He.. keeps repairing everyone's
radio and TV's for free.

487
00:36:02,584 --> 00:36:04,584
What are you saying?
- Let me speak.

488
00:36:05,167 --> 00:36:07,542
Is this why I sent
you to the best teachers?

489
00:36:09,126 --> 00:36:10,626
Taught you to speak good Hindi.

490
00:36:11,209 --> 00:36:12,667
So that you can become a great..

491
00:36:13,417 --> 00:36:15,292
I stitched clothes
to pay for your fees.

492
00:36:17,251 --> 00:36:19,959
Finally you found a job,
but you quit that as well.

493
00:36:20,584 --> 00:36:21,584
And..

494
00:36:24,459 --> 00:36:26,292
I don't win.. the jackpot either.

495
00:36:28,417 --> 00:36:29,751
I thought if you get some money..

496
00:36:29,834 --> 00:36:31,417
...I will manage a few months.

497
00:36:32,709 --> 00:36:35,751
Now, I'll have to
borrow from someone.

498
00:36:35,834 --> 00:36:37,084
No, mom.

499
00:36:37,542 --> 00:36:39,209
Let's see whether anyone
will lend me money or not. -Mom.

500
00:36:39,292 --> 00:36:42,792
Mom. Mom. Listen to me. - Aarohi.

501
00:36:44,042 --> 00:36:45,542
Let her go.

502
00:36:47,542 --> 00:36:50,834
Actually, it's not her fault.

503
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:54,667
She's always seen poverty.

504
00:36:55,959 --> 00:36:58,251
And I never gave
her anything either.

505
00:36:58,834 --> 00:36:59,834
But look.

506
00:37:00,917 --> 00:37:04,417
All our hopes are with you.

507
00:37:05,667 --> 00:37:07,792
We want good things for you.

508
00:37:13,126 --> 00:37:14,126
Father.

509
00:37:14,584 --> 00:37:17,334
First time someone's
believed in me.

510
00:37:17,959 --> 00:37:20,334
First time I believed in someone.

511
00:37:20,834 --> 00:37:24,126
He came all the way from Goa,
only for me.

512
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:28,501
And he's gone to talk
to someone for me, father.

513
00:37:28,709 --> 00:37:30,334
Uncle, I'm not joking.
- Deadlines, boys.

514
00:37:30,417 --> 00:37:31,417
There's a girl

515
00:37:34,292 --> 00:37:35,334
Thank God!

516
00:37:36,001 --> 00:37:37,251
Get married, straighten up!

517
00:37:37,417 --> 00:37:39,209
No, no, no, it's not that.

518
00:37:39,292 --> 00:37:40,292
No. - No.

519
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:44,834
This girl's a very,
very, very, very good singer.

520
00:37:45,584 --> 00:37:47,709
I would've believed you
if you had said "very" once.

521
00:37:47,792 --> 00:37:49,251
Please cancel my
appointment for tomorrow.

522
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:51,084
She was singing in a bar.

523
00:37:51,501 --> 00:37:53,584
Bar.. you mean where
you were obviously..

524
00:37:54,709 --> 00:37:55,709
Yes..

525
00:37:56,042 --> 00:37:57,542
But, what a voice.

526
00:37:57,667 --> 00:37:59,959
I had an entire bottle,
but I couldn't get drunk.

527
00:38:00,084 --> 00:38:01,709
Can you imagine?
- 15 minutes.

528
00:38:01,834 --> 00:38:04,876
Basically, I want you to
give her a chance to sing in films.

529
00:38:05,042 --> 00:38:06,751
Or, make an album.

530
00:38:07,542 --> 00:38:09,376
She's superb, uncle.
I can write that in blood.

531
00:38:09,709 --> 00:38:10,834
Do you have any blood left?

532
00:38:11,209 --> 00:38:12,042
Where is she?

533
00:38:12,084 --> 00:38:13,292
She stays here in Mumbai.

534
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:15,542
She's from a poor family..

535
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:18,167
...and performs out of
the city to make a living.

536
00:38:18,417 --> 00:38:19,667
In these small bars.

537
00:38:20,084 --> 00:38:21,917
But I am not going
to let that happen again.

538
00:38:22,501 --> 00:38:23,959
I really want to help her, uncle.

539
00:38:24,251 --> 00:38:25,501
She's a superstar.

540
00:38:28,792 --> 00:38:30,376
Superstar? - Yeah!

541
00:38:36,959 --> 00:38:42,626
A star, is someone whose songs,
and voice..

542
00:38:43,709 --> 00:38:46,917
...makes you want to..
Whistle.

543
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:49,917
Whistle.

544
00:38:50,751 --> 00:38:53,126
Just like people used
to whistle at your performance.

545
00:38:53,209 --> 00:38:54,584
You were the star. You.

546
00:38:54,792 --> 00:38:56,042
She's better than me.

547
00:38:57,167 --> 00:39:00,042
She's amazing.
I'm telling you, she's amazing.

548
00:39:01,584 --> 00:39:02,584
Call her.

549
00:39:04,292 --> 00:39:06,417
I'll first hear
her and then decide.

550
00:39:06,626 --> 00:39:07,834
You're serious? - Yes.

551
00:39:08,459 --> 00:39:09,459
Yes.

552
00:39:11,501 --> 00:39:13,209
Thank you, uncle.

553
00:39:13,792 --> 00:39:15,542
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

554
00:39:15,709 --> 00:39:17,626
Out. Get out.

555
00:39:17,834 --> 00:39:18,834
Thank you.

556
00:39:19,917 --> 00:39:22,001
Listen to him. He's a good man.

557
00:39:26,584 --> 00:39:29,292
Excuse me, give me a simcard.
- Take this.

558
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:40,959
You are leaving Deepak's show?

559
00:39:43,542 --> 00:39:45,209
You will forget to sing.

560
00:39:55,501 --> 00:39:57,126
Be careful.
Careful, please.

561
00:39:57,251 --> 00:39:58,251
Careful.

562
00:39:59,751 --> 00:40:01,751
Don't you dare tell
anyone about this!

563
00:40:02,042 --> 00:40:04,751
If any journalist or media-person asks you about him..

564
00:40:05,042 --> 00:40:07,667
...then say,
he's gone to London for a show.

565
00:40:08,751 --> 00:40:12,626
In the meanwhile, nobody comes in,
nobody talks to him.

566
00:40:12,751 --> 00:40:13,917
You get that.

567
00:40:21,376 --> 00:40:22,792
Hello. - Hello.

568
00:40:23,501 --> 00:40:26,126
Can I talk to Mr.
Rahul? My name's Aarohi.

569
00:40:26,376 --> 00:40:28,376
He asked me to call me.

570
00:40:28,584 --> 00:40:31,709
I'm a singer, we met in Goa
and he said.. - Rahul isn't here.

571
00:40:32,584 --> 00:40:34,792
He's gone to London, for his shows.

572
00:40:34,917 --> 00:40:37,667
And he'll return after 20-25 days.
- 20-25 days?

573
00:40:39,626 --> 00:40:41,542
Yes, but just listen to me..

574
00:40:42,334 --> 00:40:44,042
Hello! Hello!

575
00:40:52,792 --> 00:40:58,126
"It's your fault, my heart!"

576
00:40:58,626 --> 00:41:03,917
"it's your fault, my heart!"

577
00:41:04,459 --> 00:41:11,417
"Why did you trust him?"

578
00:41:13,042 --> 00:41:16,876
"All the promises were fake."

579
00:41:19,084 --> 00:41:22,667
"The one you followed here."

580
00:41:23,584 --> 00:41:28,584
"Beloved's nowhere."

581
00:41:29,709 --> 00:41:32,251
"Beloved's nowhere."

582
00:41:32,376 --> 00:41:36,126
"Beloved's nowhere."

583
00:41:36,626 --> 00:41:42,126
"Now, stop seeing those dreams."

584
00:41:42,501 --> 00:41:47,001
"Now, shatter those
dreams yourself."

585
00:41:47,042 --> 00:41:51,917
"Beloved's nowhere."

586
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:53,584
We don't have evidence..

587
00:41:54,501 --> 00:41:55,792
...whether Deepak's involved or not.

588
00:41:56,209 --> 00:41:58,376
But I swear Rahul.

589
00:41:59,334 --> 00:42:02,584
I will find out whoever he is and..

590
00:42:06,209 --> 00:42:07,792
Did Aarohi call?

591
00:42:10,334 --> 00:42:11,334
Not yet.

592
00:42:11,417 --> 00:42:12,792
Is your phone on?

593
00:42:15,876 --> 00:42:16,876
24/7.

594
00:42:26,542 --> 00:42:28,667
Tell this girl that
it's a wrong number.

595
00:42:30,584 --> 00:42:31,751
Hello. - Hello.

596
00:42:31,959 --> 00:42:33,209
Hello, is Rahul back.

597
00:42:33,917 --> 00:42:34,959
I am sorry, this is a wrong number.

598
00:42:35,334 --> 00:42:36,334
What?

599
00:42:36,959 --> 00:42:38,292
Hello. Hello.

600
00:42:39,917 --> 00:42:50,667
"There's punishment
for every mistake."

601
00:42:51,584 --> 00:42:56,751
"if you're destined for sadness."

602
00:42:56,834 --> 00:43:02,084
"There's always a reason."

603
00:43:03,626 --> 00:43:08,876
"All my pain has
conjured in my tears."

604
00:43:09,459 --> 00:43:14,001
"My tears don't
stop trickling down."

605
00:43:14,126 --> 00:43:16,001
"Beloved's nowhere."

606
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:19,417
"Beloved's nowhere."

607
00:43:20,209 --> 00:43:23,001
"Beloved's nowhere."

608
00:43:23,084 --> 00:43:25,834
"Beloved's nowhere."

609
00:43:29,042 --> 00:43:31,501
Okay. Give the money.

610
00:43:35,459 --> 00:43:37,626
See you. Goodbye.

611
00:43:53,542 --> 00:43:56,459
This fracture showed
me the importance of my legs.

612
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:57,751
Take care.

613
00:44:01,542 --> 00:44:02,876
Great.

614
00:44:03,251 --> 00:44:04,251
Good news.

615
00:44:04,584 --> 00:44:06,084
It's time to celebrate.

616
00:44:07,001 --> 00:44:08,792
I'll have a drink with you as well.

617
00:44:10,667 --> 00:44:12,417
Where to? - To look for Aarohi.

618
00:44:14,001 --> 00:44:15,001
Come on.

619
00:44:15,209 --> 00:44:17,584
Excuse me, is this Rahul's house?

620
00:44:17,959 --> 00:44:19,459
Yes, this is his home.

621
00:44:19,542 --> 00:44:21,126
But, sir's out of town.

622
00:44:21,209 --> 00:44:22,959
I don't know when he's coming back.

623
00:44:26,542 --> 00:44:29,542
Vivek sir said he'll be
coming back after 20-25 days.

624
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:32,042
It's been two months now.

625
00:44:32,126 --> 00:44:33,167
He hasn't returned.

626
00:44:33,251 --> 00:44:34,709
What can I do if he hasn't?

627
00:44:34,792 --> 00:44:36,417
I'll let you know
once he comes back.

628
00:44:36,501 --> 00:44:37,501
Please leave.

629
00:44:43,709 --> 00:44:45,709
Please give this top
Rahul sir when he returns.

630
00:44:49,126 --> 00:44:50,751
Tell him Aarohi was here.

631
00:44:51,751 --> 00:44:53,001
I tried calling him many times.

632
00:44:53,167 --> 00:44:54,751
I'll give it to
him once he returns.

633
00:44:54,834 --> 00:44:56,126
Please go now.

634
00:45:27,292 --> 00:45:29,167
Coming!

635
00:45:32,876 --> 00:45:34,001
What happened?

636
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:38,042
Sister-in-law, Salim.

637
00:45:38,334 --> 00:45:40,001
Aarohi. What's wrong?

638
00:45:41,084 --> 00:45:42,084
Salim.

639
00:45:42,251 --> 00:45:43,751
What's wrong? Who is it?

640
00:45:51,334 --> 00:45:52,709
What's wrong, Aarohi?

641
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:54,626
I want a job.

642
00:45:57,376 --> 00:46:01,876
Any place. Good, bad or cheap.

643
00:46:02,626 --> 00:46:03,667
Just get me work.

644
00:46:04,292 --> 00:46:06,501
I need money, Salim.

645
00:46:06,959 --> 00:46:08,459
Come in.

646
00:46:12,126 --> 00:46:14,751
Sir. A girl gave this.

647
00:46:17,501 --> 00:46:18,001
When did she come?

648
00:46:18,084 --> 00:46:19,376
Yesterday evening.

649
00:46:19,459 --> 00:46:21,709
She said she called
you two-three times.

650
00:46:21,834 --> 00:46:23,834
Maybe she spoke to Vivek sir.

651
00:46:24,084 --> 00:46:27,001
She looked decent, so I told you.

652
00:46:28,876 --> 00:46:30,709
Thank you. - Welcome sir.

653
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:37,667
What the hell is wrong with you?

654
00:46:37,834 --> 00:46:39,417
Don't ask why I did that?

655
00:46:39,876 --> 00:46:40,876
You know.

656
00:46:42,001 --> 00:46:44,917
I told that girl never
to sing in a bar again.

657
00:46:45,042 --> 00:46:47,167
I told her she'll
be a successful singer.

658
00:46:47,292 --> 00:46:49,251
I told her she will be a star.

659
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:52,959
I went to her hotel, Vivek.

660
00:46:53,001 --> 00:46:54,251
She didn't come to me.

661
00:46:54,501 --> 00:46:55,792
And what did you do?

662
00:46:56,126 --> 00:46:57,542
You humiliated her.

663
00:46:57,751 --> 00:46:59,001
You hid her calls from me.

664
00:46:59,959 --> 00:47:01,001
You lied to her.

665
00:47:02,126 --> 00:47:05,751
You treated her like an enemy.
- Yes, because I'm your friend.

666
00:47:06,834 --> 00:47:08,251
I've been with you for years.

667
00:47:08,792 --> 00:47:10,751
You could've shown
some respect for me.

668
00:47:10,959 --> 00:47:14,084
And for any darn girl..
- She's no ordinary girl!

669
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:17,667
This is why I did it.

670
00:47:18,376 --> 00:47:19,917
So that you stay away from her.

671
00:47:20,959 --> 00:47:22,667
I didn't want this to happen, man!

672
00:47:24,001 --> 00:47:26,334
First alcohol, then drugs.

673
00:47:26,626 --> 00:47:29,626
And now.. - Whatever I do
with my life is my problem, Vivek.

674
00:47:29,751 --> 00:47:30,251
No!

675
00:47:30,334 --> 00:47:31,876
This isn't your personal problem.

676
00:47:31,959 --> 00:47:33,167
I've been with you for 10 years.

677
00:47:33,542 --> 00:47:35,584
I looked after you, your career.

678
00:47:35,834 --> 00:47:38,001
I saw your success, your downfall.

679
00:47:38,292 --> 00:47:42,126
But, I can't see you
handing over your success..

680
00:47:42,292 --> 00:47:44,376
...which you need the most now,
to some girl.

681
00:47:44,959 --> 00:47:48,042
I can't see you doing
this for someone else instead.

682
00:47:48,709 --> 00:47:51,584
I feel sad. It hurts me.

683
00:47:51,834 --> 00:47:55,042
To know that you've stopped
recognizing your talent.

684
00:47:55,876 --> 00:47:58,626
You've forgotten your own voice.

685
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:01,042
One that's unmatched.

686
00:48:01,584 --> 00:48:02,584
Why?

687
00:48:02,834 --> 00:48:04,626
Why don't you see yourself?

688
00:48:04,876 --> 00:48:06,709
Why don't you hear yourself?

689
00:48:06,959 --> 00:48:08,584
You call me your enemy.

690
00:48:09,792 --> 00:48:12,917
Just.. look at yourself.

691
00:48:15,667 --> 00:48:16,834
You're right.

692
00:48:18,542 --> 00:48:20,876
But the truth is,
I don't want anything.

693
00:48:21,584 --> 00:48:25,751
Fame, fortune,
success, money, respect.

694
00:48:26,209 --> 00:48:28,792
It should all go to
the one that deserves it.

695
00:48:29,751 --> 00:48:32,001
Give the bread to the
one that's hungry for it.

696
00:48:33,001 --> 00:48:35,792
And I've seen that in that girl.

697
00:48:37,251 --> 00:48:38,834
And I no longer have that.

698
00:48:39,709 --> 00:48:41,084
And I've admitted this truth.

699
00:48:41,667 --> 00:48:42,917
You should too.

700
00:48:43,709 --> 00:48:45,792
Your friend can't pay
you your salary anymore.

701
00:48:46,251 --> 00:48:48,792
RJ. - You're a free man, Vivek.

702
00:48:49,751 --> 00:48:51,709
You can go anywhere you want.

703
00:49:05,001 --> 00:49:06,001
Hello.

704
00:49:06,167 --> 00:49:08,042
Can I talk to Aarohi, please?

705
00:49:08,126 --> 00:49:10,126
She's performing? - Where?

706
00:49:10,292 --> 00:49:11,709
Hotel Nightingale.

707
00:49:13,334 --> 00:49:19,084
"What seemed like reality,
turned out to be an illusion."

708
00:49:19,251 --> 00:49:24,542
"A saga, that was bound
for a twist, has ended."

709
00:49:24,709 --> 00:49:27,251
"I forgot, so did she."

710
00:49:27,542 --> 00:49:33,959
"How do I tell
everyone about this?"

711
00:49:34,292 --> 00:49:39,501
"I've slowly compromised myself."

712
00:49:40,042 --> 00:49:44,626
"I've slowly controlled myself."

713
00:49:44,751 --> 00:49:49,792
"Beloved's nowhere."

714
00:49:50,792 --> 00:49:53,292
"Beloved's nowhere."

715
00:49:53,709 --> 00:49:56,292
"Beloved's nowhere."

716
00:49:56,459 --> 00:50:02,501
"Beloved's nowhere."

717
00:50:03,584 --> 00:50:08,917
"it's your fault, my heart!"

718
00:50:09,459 --> 00:50:14,542
"it's your fault, my heart!"

719
00:50:15,209 --> 00:50:21,626
"Why did you trust him?"

720
00:50:23,334 --> 00:50:24,584
Aarohi! Aarohi!

721
00:50:24,792 --> 00:50:25,667
Please let me explain.

722
00:50:25,751 --> 00:50:28,042
Look. I work here.

723
00:50:28,167 --> 00:50:29,626
Don't create a scene.

724
00:50:30,001 --> 00:50:31,626
I got this job with
great difficulty.

725
00:50:31,709 --> 00:50:33,459
Damn the job,
I want to speak to you.

726
00:50:33,584 --> 00:50:34,792
Why should I?

727
00:50:35,501 --> 00:50:37,209
I've been waiting for two months.

728
00:50:37,459 --> 00:50:40,501
First time I hurt my
parents and trusted someone.

729
00:50:40,709 --> 00:50:42,167
I started dreaming.

730
00:50:43,542 --> 00:50:45,376
Everything seemed true.

731
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:46,792
What now?

732
00:50:48,626 --> 00:50:49,626
Go ahead.

733
00:50:50,584 --> 00:50:52,542
You can vent all your anger.

734
00:50:53,792 --> 00:50:55,501
I am your culprit.

735
00:50:57,709 --> 00:50:58,917
But, I am not.

736
00:51:00,667 --> 00:51:01,917
I waited for you.

737
00:51:02,751 --> 00:51:04,001
Get in.

738
00:51:04,417 --> 00:51:05,417
Come on. - What are you doing?

739
00:51:05,501 --> 00:51:07,459
Get in. - What are you doing?

740
00:51:07,792 --> 00:51:09,501
What are you doing? - Come on.

741
00:51:10,876 --> 00:51:12,251
I want to tell you a story.

742
00:51:15,001 --> 00:51:17,001
I don't want to hear your story.

743
00:51:23,001 --> 00:51:24,001
Let's go.

744
00:51:54,792 --> 00:51:56,626
If all that happened with you..

745
00:51:57,459 --> 00:51:59,042
...then, why didn't
they show it on TV?

746
00:51:59,167 --> 00:52:00,501
Aarohi, the TV..

747
00:52:01,001 --> 00:52:02,417
Please forget it.

748
00:52:02,959 --> 00:52:04,626
I want to keep my promise.

749
00:52:06,251 --> 00:52:08,251
In fact I brought
Sehgal uncle along.

750
00:52:09,001 --> 00:52:10,584
He's called you at his office.

751
00:52:13,334 --> 00:52:15,251
But, I cannot quit this job.

752
00:52:19,959 --> 00:52:21,334
I cannot take a risk again.

753
00:52:21,709 --> 00:52:22,792
Then don't..

754
00:52:23,042 --> 00:52:25,542
You can keep the job
until you're satisfied.

755
00:52:25,834 --> 00:52:28,251
But, you've believed me so far,
then why not another day.

756
00:52:31,709 --> 00:52:33,376
Be ready at 11 am tomorrow.

757
00:52:35,417 --> 00:52:36,417
Please.

758
00:52:39,751 --> 00:52:40,751
Please!

759
00:52:43,542 --> 00:52:45,001
You sing well, dear.

760
00:52:45,667 --> 00:52:46,667
You're talented.

761
00:52:47,126 --> 00:52:48,667
And you understand tunes.

762
00:52:49,126 --> 00:52:52,084
But, for playback
singing and albums..

763
00:52:52,959 --> 00:52:55,334
...you'll need some grooming.

764
00:52:55,792 --> 00:52:57,001
Just a little.

765
00:52:58,334 --> 00:53:01,334
Because singing in recording
studios with new songs..

766
00:53:01,542 --> 00:53:04,084
...can get a little overwhelming.
- Okay.

767
00:53:04,751 --> 00:53:08,417
Fine.. we'll start your
vocal training from next week.

768
00:53:09,167 --> 00:53:10,126
Yes, I'll do that.

769
00:53:10,209 --> 00:53:12,376
I'll train her. - Fantastic!

770
00:53:12,834 --> 00:53:14,001
What else do you want?

771
00:53:21,709 --> 00:53:23,917
So many awards, records.

772
00:53:25,209 --> 00:53:26,626
They're all yours.

773
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:30,834
They're mine, or not. I don't know.

774
00:53:31,459 --> 00:53:32,376
What?

775
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:33,626
Nothing.

776
00:53:34,459 --> 00:53:35,459
Don't worry.

777
00:53:35,584 --> 00:53:38,084
Someday you'll
come with your award.

778
00:53:38,584 --> 00:53:40,001
You'll have more awards than me.

779
00:53:40,376 --> 00:53:41,376
I promise.

780
00:53:54,209 --> 00:53:55,209
What?

781
00:53:57,126 --> 00:53:58,126
Nothing.

782
00:54:00,709 --> 00:54:02,001
Just like that.

783
00:54:22,501 --> 00:54:23,709
I can't do it.

784
00:54:24,792 --> 00:54:26,334
Okay, listen. I will show you.

785
00:54:26,501 --> 00:54:27,751
It's in B flat.

786
00:54:29,709 --> 00:54:36,084
"Just tell me,
whether I want it or not."

787
00:54:38,334 --> 00:54:45,084
"Show me the way to your heart,
whether I want it or not."

788
00:54:48,626 --> 00:54:50,001
You sing so well.

789
00:54:51,042 --> 00:54:53,042
It's your training not me.

790
00:54:54,292 --> 00:54:55,834
Let's start singing.

791
00:54:56,501 --> 00:55:03,709
"Just tell me,
whether I want it or not."

792
00:55:05,542 --> 00:55:12,126
"Show me the way to your heart,
whether I want it or not."

793
00:55:14,501 --> 00:55:22,709
"Let me tell you, that
I don't have faith in my love."

794
00:55:23,501 --> 00:55:25,584
"Still, the heart thought.."

795
00:55:25,709 --> 00:55:32,209
"..now that we're here,
why not ask."

796
00:55:32,459 --> 00:55:38,876
"Just tell me,
whether I want it or not."

797
00:55:41,334 --> 00:55:48,126
"Show me the way to your heart,
whether I want it or not."

798
00:56:08,001 --> 00:56:16,959
"I never had such desires before."

799
00:56:17,042 --> 00:56:25,959
"I never tried this
hard to meet anyone."

800
00:56:26,292 --> 00:56:33,084
"Solve my confusion,
whether I want it or not."

801
00:56:35,292 --> 00:56:42,209
"Express it through your eyes,
whether I want it or not."

802
00:56:43,084 --> 00:56:46,584
Aarohi! Aarohi! Aarohi!

803
00:56:49,376 --> 00:56:50,834
Ladies and Gentlemen.

804
00:56:51,126 --> 00:56:54,126
The time has come,
for me to introduce you all..

805
00:56:54,209 --> 00:56:57,084
...to the nightingale of India,
and our country's..

806
00:56:57,167 --> 00:56:59,084
...latest singing sensation.

807
00:56:59,251 --> 00:57:02,417
The beautiful,
the talented, the wonderful!

808
00:57:02,501 --> 00:57:06,084
Aarohi Keshav Shirke!

809
00:57:23,209 --> 00:57:24,209
Yes, dad.

810
00:57:24,334 --> 00:57:25,876
Rahul. How are you, son?

811
00:57:26,626 --> 00:57:28,959
Everything fine?
- Everything fine, dad.

812
00:57:30,001 --> 00:57:31,459
In fact, I'm really happy.

813
00:57:33,084 --> 00:57:34,292
After a long time.

814
00:57:35,001 --> 00:57:37,084
You're in love, huh!

815
00:57:37,334 --> 00:57:41,667
"Just tell me..

816
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:44,209
How did you know?

817
00:57:44,667 --> 00:57:46,001
I'm your father.

818
00:57:46,959 --> 00:57:48,126
Come.

819
00:57:48,292 --> 00:57:51,167
When the son's in love,
the father knows.

820
00:57:52,084 --> 00:58:00,167
"Show me the way to your heart,
whether I want it or not."

821
00:58:17,334 --> 00:58:18,126
What happened?

822
00:58:18,209 --> 00:58:20,126
Sir, she needs five more minutes.

823
00:58:23,209 --> 00:58:25,001
It's been half an hour, Rahul.

824
00:58:25,626 --> 00:58:27,834
Is there a problem?
- No, sir. There's no problem.

825
00:58:36,917 --> 00:58:37,917
Aarohi.

826
00:58:41,084 --> 00:58:42,084
Come out.

827
00:58:50,542 --> 00:58:51,542
Let's go.

828
00:58:59,084 --> 00:59:00,959
I cannot sing.

829
00:59:03,667 --> 00:59:05,542
Aarohi, we all get nervous.

830
00:59:07,501 --> 00:59:08,501
I was too.

831
00:59:09,751 --> 00:59:11,209
I ran away from the studio.

832
00:59:13,001 --> 00:59:14,001
It's okay.

833
00:59:14,917 --> 00:59:15,917
No.

834
00:59:19,042 --> 00:59:20,959
The bar was a different story.

835
00:59:22,626 --> 00:59:24,876
Making mistakes were okay.

836
00:59:26,334 --> 00:59:28,917
But, here..
amongst these big people..

837
00:59:29,042 --> 00:59:30,584
You're not alone.

838
00:59:32,751 --> 00:59:33,959
I am with you.

839
00:59:37,084 --> 00:59:38,417
Please, come out.

840
00:59:43,167 --> 00:59:45,042
I cannot sing.

841
00:59:54,126 --> 00:59:55,584
Aarohi, I love you.

842
00:59:59,042 --> 01:00:00,084
I love you.

843
01:00:03,459 --> 01:00:05,292
I've waited too long for this day.

844
01:00:06,876 --> 01:00:08,042
More than you.

845
01:00:09,834 --> 01:00:11,834
Come out for me.

846
01:00:14,459 --> 01:00:15,459
Please.

847
01:00:36,376 --> 01:00:40,501
"I've small dreams."

848
01:00:41,126 --> 01:00:45,209
"Dreams have songs."

849
01:00:45,584 --> 01:00:49,709
"Songs have life."

850
01:00:50,167 --> 01:00:53,917
"Love and affection."

851
01:00:54,376 --> 01:00:58,667
"I don't dream any longer."

852
01:00:59,084 --> 01:01:03,042
"That's without you."

853
01:01:03,584 --> 01:01:11,667
"I'm finally saying,
what I didn't so far."

854
01:01:11,959 --> 01:01:20,626
"The heart trusts you,
more than me."

855
01:01:20,959 --> 01:01:25,251
"I weave dreams about us,
in my empty moments."

856
01:01:25,459 --> 01:01:29,709
"You're in love with me."

857
01:01:29,959 --> 01:01:37,834
"I'll never ask you,
whether I want to or not."

858
01:01:39,001 --> 01:01:47,667
"I want to live in your dreams,
because I want to." - Fantastic.

859
01:01:49,626 --> 01:01:50,751
Really nice.

860
01:02:16,667 --> 01:02:18,042
Ladies and Gentlemen.

861
01:02:18,334 --> 01:02:21,876
Welcome to the Indian Music Awards.

862
01:02:23,584 --> 01:02:24,584
Finally!

863
01:02:24,876 --> 01:02:27,917
Uncle. Where's Rahul?
- We're waiting for you.

864
01:02:29,251 --> 01:02:30,709
When you can't
find Rahul anywhere..

865
01:02:30,792 --> 01:02:32,626
...you must always check the bar.

866
01:02:33,376 --> 01:02:36,709
But, it's such a big day
of my life, he should be with me.

867
01:02:36,792 --> 01:02:38,126
I've been nominated.

868
01:02:38,209 --> 01:02:39,209
I understand..

869
01:02:39,417 --> 01:02:40,626
Mom and dad are here.

870
01:02:40,709 --> 01:02:41,751
<i>I'll</i> just..

871
01:02:42,042 --> 01:02:44,709
Come. Please come.

872
01:02:47,001 --> 01:02:49,084
Come on, he'll be here. Come on.

873
01:02:49,459 --> 01:02:51,459
Please.

874
01:02:52,667 --> 01:02:54,709
Aarohi! Aarohi!

875
01:02:57,792 --> 01:02:58,792
Come here.

876
01:03:00,626 --> 01:03:02,042
Looking for me?

877
01:03:02,709 --> 01:03:03,917
You scared me.

878
01:03:04,584 --> 01:03:06,126
Where were you? - Forget that.

879
01:03:06,209 --> 01:03:07,626
How do you feel?

880
01:03:08,001 --> 01:03:09,126
It's useless.

881
01:03:11,501 --> 01:03:13,876
Wonder where you
keep disappearing to?

882
01:03:15,126 --> 01:03:16,501
I was at the bar.

883
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:20,667
If you drink so much, how
will you recognize me in the crowd?

884
01:03:21,167 --> 01:03:22,167
I will.

885
01:03:23,917 --> 01:03:28,042
Amongst,
thousands, million, billions.

886
01:03:29,792 --> 01:03:33,667
I can forget myself, but not you.

887
01:03:38,626 --> 01:03:40,251
When did you fall so
deeply in love with me?

888
01:03:40,501 --> 01:03:41,376
Hi, ma'am!

889
01:03:41,459 --> 01:03:42,792
I'm from CNTV Live.

890
01:03:42,959 --> 01:03:44,792
Do you mind if I
take a small interview?

891
01:03:45,542 --> 01:03:46,876
Please. Just for five minutes.

892
01:03:47,001 --> 01:03:49,542
No, right now I.. - Just a second.

893
01:03:50,042 --> 01:03:51,251
Never do that.

894
01:03:51,792 --> 01:03:53,084
Okay. Never do that.

895
01:03:54,917 --> 01:03:58,126
Go. Time to touch the moon.

896
01:03:59,834 --> 01:04:00,917
Go get them.

897
01:04:08,001 --> 01:04:10,917
Ladies and Gentlemen.
Moving on the next award.

898
01:04:11,584 --> 01:04:13,917
Nidhi Chaudhary for "Aa jara"

899
01:04:15,584 --> 01:04:16,876
Listen. - Yes, sir.

900
01:04:17,417 --> 01:04:19,167
Did you get the bottle from home?
- No, sir.

901
01:04:19,292 --> 01:04:20,709
Then, why are you being a miser?
Pour some more.

902
01:04:20,792 --> 01:04:21,876
Sorry, sir.

903
01:04:24,917 --> 01:04:26,542
And award goes to..

904
01:04:27,792 --> 01:04:29,834
Aarohi Keshav Shirke.

905
01:04:43,834 --> 01:04:44,834
She won!

906
01:04:46,084 --> 01:04:47,084
Thank you.

907
01:04:48,626 --> 01:04:49,959
The girl sings well.

908
01:04:50,292 --> 01:04:51,292
She's very good.

909
01:04:51,376 --> 01:04:53,376
I heard she was offered
to sing in films too.

910
01:04:53,626 --> 01:04:54,917
But she refused.

911
01:04:55,417 --> 01:04:56,501
She'll say yes.

912
01:04:56,584 --> 01:04:58,417
Everyone wants to be a star.

913
01:05:01,792 --> 01:05:04,459
Of course, she will be.

914
01:05:04,709 --> 01:05:07,709
But, not a star, a maid.

915
01:05:09,126 --> 01:05:12,001
What's that singer's name?
That star.

916
01:05:12,084 --> 01:05:13,251
Rahul.

917
01:05:14,376 --> 01:05:16,376
She'll be his maid.

918
01:05:17,001 --> 01:05:18,751
And later, his nurse.

919
01:05:19,501 --> 01:05:21,417
Come on. He loves her.

920
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:23,334
He's made her.

921
01:05:23,667 --> 01:05:26,876
She made it this
far because of him.

922
01:05:26,959 --> 01:05:29,334
That's what I am
trying to tell you.

923
01:05:29,834 --> 01:05:33,501
The higher she climbs
the ladder of success..

924
01:05:33,876 --> 01:05:36,376
...the lower she'll
fall because of Rahul.

925
01:05:36,792 --> 01:05:39,292
She belongs to a poor family,
after all.

926
01:05:40,667 --> 01:05:42,959
That's why RJ's taken her in.

927
01:05:43,417 --> 01:05:46,167
So that he can make her serve him.

928
01:05:46,792 --> 01:05:50,334
Keep her awake all night,
for his entertainment.

929
01:05:51,001 --> 01:05:54,501
To vent out the
anger of his failure.

930
01:05:55,251 --> 01:06:00,709
And as days will go by,
he will start hitting her.

931
01:06:01,876 --> 01:06:04,626
He'll beat her every day,
humiliate her.

932
01:06:06,209 --> 01:06:08,251
And once he falls sick..

933
01:06:08,876 --> 01:06:11,917
...she'll be cleaning his pukes.

934
01:06:13,292 --> 01:06:14,501
Remember this.

935
01:06:15,709 --> 01:06:17,834
Often, those who light the lamp..

936
01:06:18,167 --> 01:06:19,959
...are the ones that douse it later.

937
01:06:22,001 --> 01:06:26,042
There have been many
such stories in the industry.

938
01:06:26,459 --> 01:06:28,209
Another glass of whiskey.

939
01:06:52,376 --> 01:06:53,376
Rahul!

940
01:06:53,751 --> 01:06:54,751
Rahul!

941
01:07:05,084 --> 01:07:06,084
Rahul!

942
01:07:58,334 --> 01:08:01,126
Rahul. What are you doing?
Get down.

943
01:08:06,876 --> 01:08:09,126
Finally, you touched the moon.

944
01:08:10,876 --> 01:08:14,417
You were looking very beautiful
on the big screen with the award.

945
01:08:16,209 --> 01:08:20,417
Does this bottle
look nice in my hands?

946
01:08:28,959 --> 01:08:30,001
It doesn't.

947
01:08:33,709 --> 01:08:35,126
But what to do.

948
01:08:36,459 --> 01:08:38,834
I just can't let go.

949
01:08:46,251 --> 01:08:50,001
Rahul. - No, no, wait.

950
01:08:51,209 --> 01:08:53,667
After I got my first
break without any struggle..

951
01:08:55,667 --> 01:08:59,709
...I got fame, fortune, status.

952
01:09:01,834 --> 01:09:05,042
The world was at my feet.

953
01:09:05,876 --> 01:09:07,417
But, I didn't know what to do.

954
01:09:09,001 --> 01:09:10,667
I couldn't handle the fame..

955
01:09:12,459 --> 01:09:13,709
...or my senses.

956
01:09:14,626 --> 01:09:16,376
That was the condition yesterday..

957
01:09:16,959 --> 01:09:18,834
...It's still the same today.

958
01:09:19,209 --> 01:09:20,667
And it'll always stay that way.

959
01:09:20,792 --> 01:09:23,292
Rahul. What are you doing?

960
01:09:24,834 --> 01:09:26,251
What are you doing?

961
01:09:26,334 --> 01:09:27,792
Why are you doing this?

962
01:09:31,042 --> 01:09:33,167
We'll have to end
this relation here.

963
01:09:35,709 --> 01:09:36,709
Now.

964
01:09:38,376 --> 01:09:39,751
Nothing's lost yet.

965
01:09:41,751 --> 01:09:43,459
We aren't so close.

966
01:09:44,251 --> 01:09:46,042
We can live without each other.

967
01:09:47,459 --> 01:09:49,042
You're successful now, Aarohi.

968
01:09:51,167 --> 01:09:52,917
You've everything.

969
01:09:54,417 --> 01:09:56,292
Go, live your life.

970
01:09:57,709 --> 01:09:59,167
My habits have scared me.

971
01:10:02,126 --> 01:10:04,209
I don't know my future.

972
01:10:05,584 --> 01:10:08,959
What I might turn into.

973
01:10:09,876 --> 01:10:11,792
How I may treat you.

974
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:16,042
It doesn't take long for
one to turn into the devil.

975
01:10:17,876 --> 01:10:20,001
So, why should I hold you back?

976
01:10:23,084 --> 01:10:24,376
I can't do this.

977
01:10:39,834 --> 01:10:42,334
Then.. then..

978
01:10:43,792 --> 01:10:45,167
Leave this habit.

979
01:10:46,084 --> 01:10:47,084
Leave it.

980
01:10:48,292 --> 01:10:49,459
It's no good.

981
01:10:50,459 --> 01:10:52,001
I'll help you.

982
01:10:52,209 --> 01:10:53,584
I'll help you leave it.

983
01:10:53,834 --> 01:10:56,001
Just give me a chance..
- I can never leave it.

984
01:10:57,501 --> 01:11:01,584
It's like a wife,
that won't ever leave me alone.

985
01:11:02,959 --> 01:11:04,459
So, listen to me.

986
01:11:04,876 --> 01:11:06,542
You'll be happier without me.

987
01:11:08,334 --> 01:11:13,001
That means, you can live
with this habit, but not me.

988
01:11:15,834 --> 01:11:16,834
Rahul.

989
01:11:17,251 --> 01:11:20,667
Love is not a joke.
- But my life is.

990
01:11:22,751 --> 01:11:25,667
But, you always had this habit.

991
01:11:28,042 --> 01:11:32,042
If you were so scared,
why did you come so close?

992
01:11:33,459 --> 01:11:35,417
You should've stayed away.
- Exactly.

993
01:11:36,626 --> 01:11:38,501
Until now, I was my own enemy!

994
01:11:38,959 --> 01:11:41,626
And before I become a
threat to you, just go away!

995
01:11:47,126 --> 01:11:48,126
Fine.

996
01:11:50,126 --> 01:11:51,626
I am going.

997
01:11:52,959 --> 01:11:56,542
Away, from you and this success.

998
01:11:57,792 --> 01:12:00,667
Don't misjudge your success.

999
01:12:02,084 --> 01:12:04,376
Only a few fortune people get it.

1000
01:12:05,251 --> 01:12:06,251
I know.

1001
01:12:07,292 --> 01:12:10,876
And also that,
you were with me in my bad times.

1002
01:12:11,917 --> 01:12:13,834
But if you're not with
me in my good times..

1003
01:12:14,501 --> 01:12:16,126
...then I don't want it.

1004
01:12:36,042 --> 01:12:37,042
Aarohi!

1005
01:12:37,542 --> 01:12:39,459
Aarohi! Aarohi!

1006
01:12:40,042 --> 01:12:41,501
Aarohi, listen!

1007
01:12:45,584 --> 01:12:50,584
"I can't live without you."

1008
01:12:50,751 --> 01:12:55,626
"I don't exist without you."

1009
01:13:00,792 --> 01:13:05,917
"I can't live without you."

1010
01:13:06,042 --> 01:13:10,751
"I don't exist without you."

1011
01:13:11,084 --> 01:13:21,417
"if I separate from you,
I'll lose myself."

1012
01:13:23,459 --> 01:13:28,251
"Because it's you.. it's you."

1013
01:13:28,834 --> 01:13:33,709
"You're my life."

1014
01:13:34,084 --> 01:13:38,501
"My relief, my pain."

1015
01:13:38,792 --> 01:13:44,251
"You're my love."

1016
01:14:04,792 --> 01:14:14,626
"We can't stay away a moment."

1017
01:14:14,959 --> 01:14:19,792
"I live only for you."

1018
01:14:20,042 --> 01:14:24,542
"All my time is devoted to you."

1019
01:14:24,709 --> 01:14:29,459
"I can't live a
moment without you."

1020
01:14:29,792 --> 01:14:36,751
"Each breath's just for you."

1021
01:14:37,542 --> 01:14:42,459
"Because it's you.. it's you."

1022
01:14:42,876 --> 01:14:48,042
"You're my life."

1023
01:14:48,126 --> 01:14:52,501
"My relief, my pain."

1024
01:14:52,834 --> 01:14:57,667
"You're my love."

1025
01:15:07,584 --> 01:15:09,459
Uncle one second wait uncle.

1026
01:15:14,459 --> 01:15:17,042
Yes uncle don't worry.

1027
01:15:17,542 --> 01:15:19,459
Aarohi! - Yes, mom.

1028
01:15:21,292 --> 01:15:27,001
Dear, you're getting in
a live-in relation with him.

1029
01:15:27,876 --> 01:15:30,417
Without marriage?

1030
01:15:32,126 --> 01:15:35,959
What's the world going to say?

1031
01:15:38,376 --> 01:15:41,501
This is my world..

1032
01:15:44,167 --> 01:15:45,959
...that's it.

1033
01:16:01,542 --> 01:16:06,459
"I lived only for you."

1034
01:16:06,542 --> 01:16:11,751
"I've surrendered myself."

1035
01:16:11,834 --> 01:16:16,501
"Your loyalty supported me."

1036
01:16:16,792 --> 01:16:22,126
"it cured all my pain."

1037
01:16:22,334 --> 01:16:27,251
"My destiny's tied with you."

1038
01:16:27,584 --> 01:16:32,292
"You made me complete."

1039
01:16:35,251 --> 01:16:40,167
"Because it's you.. it's you."

1040
01:16:40,584 --> 01:16:45,709
"You're my life."

1041
01:16:45,917 --> 01:16:50,251
"My relief, my pain."

1042
01:16:50,584 --> 01:16:55,459
"You're my love."

1043
01:16:55,709 --> 01:17:00,501
"Because it's you.. it's you."

1044
01:17:01,167 --> 01:17:05,667
"You're my life."

1045
01:17:06,292 --> 01:17:10,376
"My relief, my pain."

1046
01:17:11,042 --> 01:17:15,876
"You're my love."

1047
01:17:30,876 --> 01:17:31,876
Sir.

1048
01:17:33,042 --> 01:17:35,126
Sir, Vivek's here to see you.

1049
01:17:36,292 --> 01:17:37,876
He has won our heart.

1050
01:17:38,376 --> 01:17:40,417
And today for his new song..

1051
01:17:40,542 --> 01:17:43,626
...'YARA' he is going to be
honored with the national award.

1052
01:17:44,042 --> 01:17:47,584
Now Aarohi's name will
be written in history.

1053
01:17:55,501 --> 01:17:56,501
Hi.

1054
01:18:00,667 --> 01:18:02,292
I came to apologize.

1055
01:18:07,709 --> 01:18:09,501
What I did..

1056
01:18:11,251 --> 01:18:13,626
I shouldn't have done..
- Forget it.

1057
01:18:15,376 --> 01:18:16,376
Forget it.

1058
01:18:18,292 --> 01:18:21,126
I thought you would still
be angry.. - Forget it.

1059
01:18:22,209 --> 01:18:23,084
What will you drink?

1060
01:18:23,167 --> 01:18:25,917
Enough. Stop. What are you doing?

1061
01:18:34,459 --> 01:18:35,876
Is there any work?

1062
01:18:39,417 --> 01:18:40,417
What?

1063
01:18:40,667 --> 01:18:41,751
I want to work.

1064
01:18:41,959 --> 01:18:43,167
I am not alone.

1065
01:18:43,792 --> 01:18:44,792
There is.

1066
01:18:46,417 --> 01:18:48,709
There's a small-time producer.

1067
01:18:49,292 --> 01:18:50,709
They want to record a song.

1068
01:18:51,126 --> 01:18:53,542
Will you sing for them? - So what?

1069
01:18:54,584 --> 01:18:56,417
Music can't be compared with money.

1070
01:19:01,167 --> 01:19:02,334
This is just good.

1071
01:19:03,501 --> 01:19:04,709
Let's do this.

1072
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:05,959
Let's just do this.

1073
01:19:06,042 --> 01:19:10,334
You know what, you're back.

1074
01:19:10,501 --> 01:19:12,834
You're back my friend.
You're back.

1075
01:19:18,001 --> 01:19:22,501
"It's not easy to be in love."

1076
01:19:22,709 --> 01:19:27,126
"To shed tears."

1077
01:19:27,459 --> 01:19:32,042
"Lovers are always
struck with grief."

1078
01:19:32,167 --> 01:19:36,459
"Not everyone's blessed with this
boon." - Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

1079
01:19:37,542 --> 01:19:39,376
Sir, the pitch is going flat.
Please up it a little.

1080
01:19:40,292 --> 01:19:41,542
One more. - Yes.

1081
01:19:41,626 --> 01:19:42,626
Come on.

1082
01:19:46,167 --> 01:19:50,751
"It's not easy to be in love."

1083
01:19:50,917 --> 01:19:53,501
"To shed tears." - Stop!
Stop! Stop!

1084
01:19:53,917 --> 01:19:55,251
Sir, again pitch problem, sir.

1085
01:19:55,417 --> 01:19:57,542
One more. - Okay.

1086
01:19:57,834 --> 01:19:59,084
Yeah. One more.

1087
01:20:05,251 --> 01:20:08,542
"It's not easy.." - Stop.

1088
01:20:08,626 --> 01:20:12,251
Do you want me to down it a little?
- No, no need.

1089
01:20:12,584 --> 01:20:14,292
Let's try again. - Yeah.

1090
01:20:15,626 --> 01:20:18,334
My voice.. One more.

1091
01:20:18,751 --> 01:20:19,751
Come on.

1092
01:20:28,251 --> 01:20:29,417
What's wrong?

1093
01:20:32,292 --> 01:20:33,667
Think it's funny?

1094
01:20:34,667 --> 01:20:35,834
Can you sing this song?

1095
01:20:37,917 --> 01:20:40,376
Can you?
Then sing it. - Sir..

1096
01:20:40,459 --> 01:20:43,084
Sing it..
- Sorry, sir. it.. Wasn't for you..

1097
01:20:43,167 --> 01:20:45,834
The tune's so strange, and you..

1098
01:20:48,626 --> 01:20:49,876
I need a break.

1099
01:20:50,709 --> 01:20:51,709
Sorry.

1100
01:21:02,334 --> 01:21:03,834
Rahul, I won't spare them.

1101
01:21:04,459 --> 01:21:06,376
I swear they won't
know what came their way.

1102
01:21:07,209 --> 01:21:08,751
Who do they think they are?

1103
01:21:09,917 --> 01:21:11,167
Let's go inside.

1104
01:21:11,584 --> 01:21:12,876
Come on, I'll show them.

1105
01:21:12,959 --> 01:21:14,042
Come on.

1106
01:21:18,876 --> 01:21:20,292
I've lost my voice.

1107
01:21:22,542 --> 01:21:23,876
I couldn't sing.

1108
01:21:28,084 --> 01:21:30,001
My vocal chords are fried.

1109
01:21:32,751 --> 01:21:33,959
That's not true.

1110
01:21:35,501 --> 01:21:36,501
It's okay.

1111
01:21:38,042 --> 01:21:39,417
It happens.

1112
01:21:40,792 --> 01:21:42,126
Let's try again. - I am finished.

1113
01:21:42,292 --> 01:21:53,459
"You.. leave me.."

1114
01:21:54,917 --> 01:22:04,542
"That can never happen..

1115
01:22:05,417 --> 01:22:10,001
...beloved."

1116
01:22:14,584 --> 01:22:15,876
He's back again.

1117
01:22:19,751 --> 01:22:22,917
These stars look
so ugly after they flop.

1118
01:22:24,209 --> 01:22:30,417
"I always mention about you."

1119
01:22:34,417 --> 01:22:40,709
"I'm always concerned about you."

1120
01:22:44,626 --> 01:22:51,959
"I am what you are."

1121
01:22:54,876 --> 01:23:02,959
"You're the one that
gave me my style."

1122
01:23:04,042 --> 01:23:09,042
"Because it's you.. it's you."

1123
01:23:09,584 --> 01:23:14,709
"You're my life."

1124
01:23:14,792 --> 01:23:19,042
"My relief, my pain."

1125
01:23:19,417 --> 01:23:24,292
"You're my love."

1126
01:23:24,917 --> 01:23:29,167
"it's you.. it's you."

1127
01:23:30,001 --> 01:23:35,001
"You're my pain, you're my cure."

1128
01:23:35,292 --> 01:23:39,542
"My relief, my pain."

1129
01:23:39,834 --> 01:23:45,209
"You're my love."

1130
01:24:16,459 --> 01:24:17,876
Sorry.

1131
01:24:19,042 --> 01:24:21,459
I tried,
but I couldn't come earlier.

1132
01:24:25,292 --> 01:24:26,709
How was the recording?

1133
01:24:27,751 --> 01:24:29,084
Nothing happened?

1134
01:24:29,917 --> 01:24:32,876
So, what did you do today?
- Nothing.

1135
01:24:33,292 --> 01:24:34,292
I was listening to my songs.

1136
01:24:34,376 --> 01:24:35,709
Trying to sing-

1137
01:24:36,292 --> 01:24:37,667
You don't get them these days.

1138
01:24:38,709 --> 01:24:39,709
You will.

1139
01:24:40,209 --> 01:24:42,417
I will pray for you.

1140
01:24:43,042 --> 01:24:43,959
You can do that later.

1141
01:24:44,042 --> 01:24:46,209
But first, did you eat or..

1142
01:24:46,334 --> 01:24:48,292
...were you singing
on an empty stomach?

1143
01:24:56,959 --> 01:24:58,292
I am very hungry.

1144
01:25:00,042 --> 01:25:01,584
Let's go out.

1145
01:25:01,834 --> 01:25:03,834
Let's stay here. I've ordered food.

1146
01:25:03,959 --> 01:25:04,959
It'll be here soon.

1147
01:25:05,917 --> 01:25:08,167
Aarohi,
there were few calls for you.

1148
01:25:08,876 --> 01:25:10,084
Sehgal uncle called.

1149
01:25:10,292 --> 01:25:12,209
He spoke to someone for you.

1150
01:25:13,084 --> 01:25:15,334
There was a call
from a talent show.

1151
01:25:15,709 --> 01:25:17,251
For a judging job, or something..

1152
01:25:17,334 --> 01:25:19,709
And from a magazine as well.
For an interview.

1153
01:25:19,834 --> 01:25:22,084
I asked him to call tomorrow.

1154
01:25:22,542 --> 01:25:24,001
Rahul. - Yes.

1155
01:25:24,834 --> 01:25:25,876
Look at me.

1156
01:25:41,292 --> 01:25:42,876
Has anything changed?

1157
01:25:52,667 --> 01:25:54,709
Nothing's changed?

1158
01:25:56,417 --> 01:25:57,417
Come here.

1159
01:26:05,667 --> 01:26:06,667
Food.

1160
01:26:10,376 --> 01:26:11,959
How much? - How much? - 1560.

1161
01:26:12,792 --> 01:26:14,042
I got it. I got it.

1162
01:26:14,709 --> 01:26:16,209
How much? - 1560.

1163
01:26:18,667 --> 01:26:20,751
1560.

1164
01:26:22,251 --> 01:26:23,376
Keep the change. Thank you.

1165
01:26:23,667 --> 01:26:25,584
Can I get an autograph? - Yes.

1166
01:26:27,917 --> 01:26:29,001
Not yours, madam's.

1167
01:26:37,792 --> 01:26:39,001
I'll call her.

1168
01:26:48,542 --> 01:26:50,792
Aarohi, he wants your autograph.

1169
01:26:51,417 --> 01:26:54,209
Now. I'll give it later.

1170
01:26:57,459 --> 01:26:59,001
These moments are priceless.

1171
01:27:00,542 --> 01:27:02,126
They don't come back.

1172
01:27:02,876 --> 01:27:03,876
Go.

1173
01:27:04,834 --> 01:27:06,001
I'll do it, go.

1174
01:27:31,751 --> 01:27:33,542
I'm a big fan, madam.

1175
01:27:34,584 --> 01:27:36,001
I listen to all your songs, madam.

1176
01:27:36,042 --> 01:27:37,126
All of them.

1177
01:27:39,042 --> 01:27:40,209
<i>Name'? - An“.</i>

1178
01:27:40,917 --> 01:27:41,917
<i>An“ .</i>

1179
01:27:42,667 --> 01:27:44,667
I had a great desire to meet you.

1180
01:27:45,751 --> 01:27:47,209
I'm really happy-

1181
01:27:50,959 --> 01:27:52,542
Thank you, madam. Thank you.

1182
01:27:56,001 --> 01:27:58,667
Due to your tax problems,
your accounts have been sealed.

1183
01:27:59,334 --> 01:28:01,542
You've only few millions left.

1184
01:28:03,292 --> 01:28:04,876
But, you can't withdraw them.

1185
01:28:05,667 --> 01:28:07,709
I've struck a deal
for your house as well.

1186
01:28:08,376 --> 01:28:12,334
It's a penthouse,
so it'll sell easily.

1187
01:28:13,792 --> 01:28:14,917
It'll take some time.

1188
01:28:16,001 --> 01:28:17,959
Sorry, sir.
But your card is not working.

1189
01:28:21,667 --> 01:28:24,376
Just like that.. - No problem.

1190
01:28:25,042 --> 01:28:25,917
Thank you sir.

1191
01:28:26,001 --> 01:28:27,251
We're not that bad.

1192
01:28:27,751 --> 01:28:35,917
"It's you."

1193
01:28:37,042 --> 01:28:43,959
"it's you."

1194
01:29:03,417 --> 01:29:05,001
It's all over.

1195
01:29:06,751 --> 01:29:07,751
Rahul.

1196
01:29:09,251 --> 01:29:10,126
It's all over.

1197
01:29:10,209 --> 01:29:11,501
What's all this?

1198
01:29:12,751 --> 01:29:14,001
Nothing to drink.

1199
01:29:16,584 --> 01:29:17,751
It's all over.

1200
01:29:20,626 --> 01:29:22,376
It's all over.
- What are you doing?

1201
01:29:25,251 --> 01:29:26,417
It's all over.

1202

It's all over.

1204
01:29:30,751 --> 01:29:31,959
It's all over.

1205
01:29:32,626 --> 01:29:34,042
It's all over. - Rahul.

1206
01:29:34,459 --> 01:29:36,001
It's all over. - Rahul.

Rahul. - It's all over.

1213
01:29:51,376 --> 01:29:53,917
What are you doing?

1214
01:29:54,084 --> 01:29:56,417
Nothing's over yet.

1215
01:29:56,709 --> 01:29:58,126
Nothing's over yet.
- It's all over.

1216
01:29:58,459 --> 01:29:59,501
Nothing's over yet.

1217
01:29:59,667 --> 01:30:00,709
Nothing's over yet.

1218
01:30:00,834 --> 01:30:02,001
Everything's okay.

1219
01:30:02,459 --> 01:30:04,959
I'll get water.

1220
01:30:46,126 --> 01:30:47,209

It's everything okay?

1226
01:31:34,501 --> 01:31:35,959
Why are you sounding so low.

1227
01:31:38,751 --> 01:31:39,959
What happened?

"Go here, go there.
Don't sit here."

1264
01:34:11,251 --> 01:34:12,084
Rahul come on.

1265
01:34:12,167 --> 01:34:14,084
Earned a lot for him.

1266
01:34:14,334 --> 01:34:16,709
I sung one hit song after another.

1267
01:34:18,292 --> 01:34:19,626
Relax - What relax?

1268
01:34:19,917 --> 01:34:21,834
And, now they bloody
treat me like this.

1269
01:34:22,084 --> 01:34:24,667
I've been to many
such parties in my life.

1270
01:34:25,501 --> 01:34:28,001
I am Rahul Jayekar.
I am a bloody! star.

1271
01:34:28,417 --> 01:34:30,126
I am still sing
better than everyone.

1272
01:34:31,667 --> 01:34:35,251
I was, I am and always will be.
- Rahul.

1273
01:34:47,792 --> 01:34:49,876
Aarohi.

1274
01:34:55,834 --> 01:34:56,834
Get up.

1275
01:35:03,709 --> 01:35:04,834
Rahul. - No.

1276
01:35:05,084 --> 01:35:06,084
Rahul, stop.

1277
01:35:06,209 --> 01:35:08,959
No, let him go.
- Let him go.

1278
01:35:51,001 --> 01:35:57,584
"It's just you."

1279
01:36:00,334 --> 01:36:06,792
"it's just you."

1280
01:36:22,584 --> 01:36:23,709
Sorry, sorry.

1281
01:36:43,209 --> 01:36:44,417
Don't do this.

1282
01:36:47,584 --> 01:36:48,834
Stop it.

1283
01:36:48,959 --> 01:36:50,751
You're always hovering around me.

1284
01:36:50,876 --> 01:36:52,126
What am I doing? Why am I doing it?

1285
01:36:52,209 --> 01:36:54,376
Am I asleep? Am I awake?
- Rahul, what are you doing?

1286
01:36:54,459 --> 01:36:56,417
I'm fed up of this.

1287
01:36:56,751 --> 01:36:58,417
I was better-off before. - Rahul.

1288
01:36:58,584 --> 01:37:00,209
I was happier alone.
- Listen to me.

1289
01:37:00,334 --> 01:37:02,209
I feel suffocated
since you came here.

1290
01:37:02,292 --> 01:37:04,251
What are you doing, Rahul?
- Get lost.

1291
01:37:04,501 --> 01:37:06,001
Go!
- Rahul, listen to me.

1292
01:37:06,584 --> 01:37:07,667
Just go away!

1293
01:37:07,751 --> 01:37:09,292
Just go away!

1294
01:37:16,626 --> 01:37:18,209
Rahul, open the door.

1295
01:37:21,042 --> 01:37:22,042
Please.

1296
01:37:32,001 --> 01:37:34,001
We all fall weak, Rahul.

1297
01:37:36,209 --> 01:37:37,334
We're scared.

1298
01:37:39,834 --> 01:37:40,834
I was too.

1299
01:37:43,751 --> 01:37:46,584
I thought that was my life.

1300
01:37:49,292 --> 01:37:51,042
Then, you came in my life.

1301
01:37:56,292 --> 01:37:58,167
And changed everything.

1302
01:38:01,334 --> 01:38:04,876
You cannot leave me alone
after giving me all this.

1303
01:38:11,417 --> 01:38:12,626
I love you!

1304
01:38:16,376 --> 01:38:17,792
I love you!

1305
01:38:19,584 --> 01:38:21,584
This is what you've
been waiting for.

1306
01:38:23,792 --> 01:38:24,792
It's here.

1307
01:38:26,459 --> 01:38:29,042
I am what you wanted to make me.

1308
01:38:31,542 --> 01:38:37,626
At least,
open the door for my sake.

1309
01:38:40,376 --> 01:38:41,376
Please.

1310
01:38:54,626 --> 01:38:58,751
At least, open the door..

1311
01:39:00,417 --> 01:39:10,667
"Empty.. your eyes."

1312
01:39:11,709 --> 01:39:21,084
"I wish you.. could fill my eyes."

1313
01:39:21,167 --> 01:39:22,167
Help me.

1314
01:39:22,584 --> 01:39:33,042
"I wish you.. could fill
my eyes." - Please help me.

1315
01:39:33,084 --> 01:39:35,084
How can they disappear?
- I don't know.

1316
01:39:35,209 --> 01:39:37,501
We've recordings lined up,
shows have been organized.

1317
01:39:37,959 --> 01:39:39,126
Who is going to do it?

1318
01:39:39,209 --> 01:39:42,001
Find out where they are. - Yes sir.

1319
01:40:05,834 --> 01:40:11,084
"My beloved,
if you give me your pain."

1320
01:40:11,459 --> 01:40:17,042
"I swear I'll get better."

1321
01:40:21,959 --> 01:40:27,959
"My beloved,
if you give me your pain."

1322
01:40:28,167 --> 01:40:33,292
"I swear I'll get better."

1323
01:40:33,626 --> 01:40:38,917
"if you give me this gift.."

1324
01:40:39,209 --> 01:40:44,334
"if you give me this gift.."

1325
01:40:44,542 --> 01:40:49,876
"I'll forsake all happiness."

1326
01:40:50,334 --> 01:40:55,626
lull" die."

1327
01:40:56,001 --> 01:40:59,167
lull" die."

1328
01:41:01,584 --> 01:41:07,042
"My beloved,
if you give me your pain."

1329
01:41:07,167 --> 01:41:13,501
"I swear I'll get better."

1330
01:41:29,459 --> 01:41:34,876
"I want to spend the rest of
my life, leaning on your shoulder."

1331
01:41:35,042 --> 01:41:40,501
"if my dream comes true,
I'll be so fortunate."

1332
01:41:40,584 --> 01:41:46,084
"it'll be your tears, and my eyes."

1333
01:41:46,167 --> 01:41:56,042
"if you give me your grief."

1334
01:41:57,292 --> 01:42:02,334
"if you give me your grief."

1335
01:42:02,667 --> 01:42:07,959
"I'll be filled with happiness."

1336
01:42:08,501 --> 01:42:11,292
lull" die."

1337
01:42:14,167 --> 01:42:17,417
lull" die."

1338
01:42:19,626 --> 01:42:25,251
"My beloved,
if you give me your pain."

1339
01:42:25,334 --> 01:42:30,417
"I swear I'll get better."

1340
01:42:30,501 --> 01:42:33,459
And now,
I'd like to invite on stage..

1341
01:42:33,542 --> 01:42:37,376
...the one that's
captivated our hearts.

1342
01:42:38,751 --> 01:42:43,334
I would like to call upon,
our favorite RJ.

1343
01:42:43,417 --> 01:42:45,751
That is Rahul Jayekar.

1344
01:42:45,959 --> 01:42:47,209
Clap!

1345
01:42:47,584 --> 01:42:51,792
RJ! RJ! RJ! RJ!

1346
01:42:51,876 --> 01:42:58,334
RJ! RJ! RJ! RJ!

1347
01:43:04,251 --> 01:43:09,792
"Whether in happiness, or grief."

1348
01:43:09,876 --> 01:43:12,584
"The heart always
called out to you."

1349
01:43:12,667 --> 01:43:15,334
"You made me, you shaped me up."

1350
01:43:15,459 --> 01:43:20,959
"The world looks up to God,
but you're my support."

1351
01:43:21,042 --> 01:43:24,167
"All I need is you."

1352
01:43:26,542 --> 01:43:29,917
"No matter what it is."

1353
01:43:32,126 --> 01:43:34,584
"All I need is you."

1354
01:43:34,959 --> 01:43:37,459
"No matter what it is."

1355
01:43:37,584 --> 01:43:42,667
"I'll do it for you.

1356
01:43:43,042 --> 01:43:46,209
Lull" die."

1357
01:43:48,917 --> 01:43:52,001
lull" die."

1358
01:43:54,542 --> 01:44:00,001
"My beloved,
if you give me your pain."

1359
01:44:00,167 --> 01:44:05,626
"I swear I'll get better."

1360
01:44:05,709 --> 01:44:10,917
"My beloved,
if you give me your pain."

1361
01:44:11,292 --> 01:44:17,334
"I swear I'll get better."

1362
01:44:32,626 --> 01:44:34,834
The recording studio
called yesterday.

1363
01:44:36,292 --> 01:44:37,751
You didn't go for your recording.

1364
01:44:40,626 --> 01:44:42,209
Rahul needs me, and..

1365
01:44:44,001 --> 01:44:45,542
I want to look after him.

1366
01:44:46,751 --> 01:44:49,876
If I stay busy,
who will look after him?

1367
01:44:50,001 --> 01:44:51,501
He's going nowhere.

1368
01:44:51,834 --> 01:44:54,417
You'll be at loss, because
you don't know what you have here.

1369
01:44:55,042 --> 01:44:59,542
You can lose all this in a moment.

1370
01:45:00,292 --> 01:45:02,084
I tried explaining it to him.

1371
01:45:03,751 --> 01:45:05,709
I beg you.

1372
01:45:05,792 --> 01:45:07,709
Don't test me.

1373
01:45:23,292 --> 01:45:25,084
I'm tying you down, right?

1374
01:45:29,834 --> 01:45:31,292
Don't do this, Aarohi.

1375
01:45:32,001 --> 01:45:33,834
Don't miss your schedules.

1376
01:45:50,209 --> 01:45:52,001
I'll stay here, with you.

1377
01:45:55,001 --> 01:45:56,834
Otherwise you will be alone.

1378
01:45:57,917 --> 01:45:59,667
You will do whatever you wish.

1379
01:46:01,376 --> 01:46:03,376
I cannot take this risk.

1380
01:46:05,334 --> 01:46:07,709
I won't break your trust this time.
- But, Rahul..

1381
01:46:07,792 --> 01:46:10,001
And you won't waste
your life for me.

1382
01:46:10,042 --> 01:46:12,917
But, Rahul I..
- Aarohi, your failure..

1383
01:46:13,001 --> 01:46:14,876
...will be the biggest
defeat of my life.

1384
01:46:20,542 --> 01:46:23,792
I cannot see you
go down the same lane.

1385
01:46:25,042 --> 01:46:26,459
You'll never be Rahul Jayekar.

1386
01:46:27,459 --> 01:46:28,751
Not even for me.

1387
01:46:30,334 --> 01:46:31,417
Promise me.

1388
01:46:40,751 --> 01:46:42,334
Best of luck. Do well.

1389
01:46:44,251 --> 01:46:45,209
I am right here.

1390
01:46:45,292 --> 01:46:46,542
It's here just for you.

1391
01:46:48,209 --> 01:46:49,917
Ma'am we ready for you.

1392
01:46:50,626 --> 01:46:52,709
Lovely Aarohi Shirke.

1393
01:46:53,251 --> 01:46:54,584
Okay-

1394
01:47:00,626 --> 01:47:01,626
Who's he?

1395
01:47:03,459 --> 01:47:04,584
Yes I will come.

1396
01:47:08,167 --> 01:47:09,167
See you.

1397
01:47:16,834 --> 01:47:18,042
Rahul Jayekar.

1398
01:47:23,626 --> 01:47:26,167
What's up, buddy? - Nothing much.

1399
01:47:27,167 --> 01:47:28,292
How are you?

1400
01:47:30,001 --> 01:47:31,001
Rocking.

1401
01:47:32,584 --> 01:47:33,959
What are you doing here?

1402
01:47:35,626 --> 01:47:37,001
Watching the show.

1403
01:47:38,959 --> 01:47:40,126
Good to see you.

1404
01:47:40,417 --> 01:47:42,501
You're doing well. - Yeah.

1405
01:47:56,792 --> 01:47:57,792
Rahul!

1406
01:48:01,459 --> 01:48:02,959
Sorry. Beer?

1407
01:48:11,251 --> 01:48:12,751
No, thanks. - Sure?

1408
01:48:18,584 --> 01:48:20,042
Yeah. Quit!

1409
01:48:22,876 --> 01:48:24,126
Pass me a diet coke.

1410
01:48:28,167 --> 01:48:29,292
Diet coke, huh!

1411
01:48:32,667 --> 01:48:33,667
Cheers.

1412
01:48:34,667 --> 01:48:35,667
Cheers.

1413
01:48:43,876 --> 01:48:44,876
Mr. Rahul.

1414
01:48:46,084 --> 01:48:48,917
Kunal Basu, I'm a journalist.

1415
01:48:50,084 --> 01:48:51,042
Okay-

1416
01:48:51,126 --> 01:48:52,959
I want an interview.

1417
01:48:54,417 --> 01:48:55,917
Exclusive interview.

1418
01:48:57,584 --> 01:49:01,292
About your personal life,
etcetera, etcetera.

1419
01:49:01,792 --> 01:49:03,792
Sorry, but I'm no
longer famous enough..

1420
01:49:03,876 --> 01:49:05,709
...for people to read about my life.

1421
01:49:06,501 --> 01:49:07,334
They know it all.

1422
01:49:07,417 --> 01:49:08,959
Not about your love-life.

1423
01:49:10,042 --> 01:49:12,959
I mean, the thing between
you and Ms. Aarohi.

1424
01:49:13,209 --> 01:49:15,376
Few people know about it.

1425
01:49:16,167 --> 01:49:18,292
I don't want to talk
about me and Aarohi.

1426
01:49:20,292 --> 01:49:21,876
You don't understand.

1427
01:49:23,876 --> 01:49:28,209
Aarohi's fans want to know
when she's getting married.

1428
01:49:28,917 --> 01:49:31,292
I told you this is
my personal matter..

1429
01:49:31,376 --> 01:49:33,251
...and I don't want
to talk about it.

1430
01:49:33,459 --> 01:49:36,209
Your personal life's
public property as well.

1431
01:49:37,292 --> 01:49:38,626
No, it's not.

1432
01:49:39,459 --> 01:49:40,459
Thank you.

1433
01:49:45,459 --> 01:49:46,459
Mr. Rahul.

1434
01:49:47,084 --> 01:49:51,417
You don't know what
people say about you two.

1435
01:49:51,917 --> 01:49:53,334
That's nothing new.

1436
01:49:53,709 --> 01:49:58,251
People also say that,
Aarohi used to sing in beer bars.

1437
01:49:58,626 --> 01:50:02,792
And you supported her
just to have some fun.

1438
01:50:03,917 --> 01:50:05,042
You used her.

1439
01:50:07,001 --> 01:50:09,667
You made her your
concubine and left her.

1440
01:50:11,126 --> 01:50:13,001
Who do you think you are?
- What are you doing?

1441
01:50:13,042 --> 01:50:14,709
You dare hit a journalist.

1442
01:50:14,834 --> 01:50:16,292
Who do you think you are?

1443
01:50:16,376 --> 01:50:18,584
You ruined a girl's life.

1444
01:50:18,751 --> 01:50:20,667
You sleep with that girl.

1445
01:50:20,751 --> 01:50:23,751
You stay with her,
but you can't admit it.

1446
01:50:24,001 --> 01:50:26,334
I'll have you arrested. Wait.

1447
01:50:26,501 --> 01:50:27,542
You rascal.

1448
01:51:43,334 --> 01:51:47,167
9870541084.

1449
01:51:47,417 --> 01:51:49,126
Yes, that's my number.

1450
01:51:49,542 --> 01:51:50,751
Save it. Okay.

1451
01:51:56,959 --> 01:51:59,751
We're here for him.

1452
01:52:00,167 --> 01:52:01,167
Him.

1453
01:52:02,459 --> 01:52:03,584
Not possible.

1454
01:52:04,459 --> 01:52:05,501
What a man.

1455
01:52:07,417 --> 01:52:09,334
He was drunk.
He created quite a scene.

1456
01:52:09,501 --> 01:52:10,876
He beat-up a journalist.

1457
01:52:12,292 --> 01:52:14,292
Then, he beat-up a taxi-driver.

1458
01:52:15,417 --> 01:52:17,209
He smashed someone's car.

1459
01:52:18,376 --> 01:52:19,667
That's not done.

1460
01:52:20,667 --> 01:52:23,042
And what's the time now.

1461
01:52:24,209 --> 01:52:25,709
You won't get bail now.

1462
01:52:30,459 --> 01:52:33,626
I'll call Kamte.

1463
01:52:35,084 --> 01:52:37,792
The court will open
at 11 am tomorrow.

1464
01:52:37,876 --> 01:52:39,501
He'll be present
in the court first..

1465
01:52:39,584 --> 01:52:42,001
...only then he can get bail.
He has to stay here tonight.

1466
01:52:42,209 --> 01:52:43,209
Brother.

1467
01:52:45,084 --> 01:52:48,959
Can I have a minute? - Sit.

1468
01:52:51,917 --> 01:52:54,417
L.. - I know..

1469
01:52:55,751 --> 01:52:58,209
You're Aarohi Shirke, right.

1470
01:53:01,001 --> 01:53:02,001
Yes.

1471
01:53:03,209 --> 01:53:04,334
Who's he?

1472
01:53:04,667 --> 01:53:05,667
In.

1473
01:53:08,001 --> 01:53:09,167
We're friends.

1474
01:53:10,376 --> 01:53:12,167
We had a fight.

1475
01:53:12,917 --> 01:53:15,042
I threatened to leave him.

1476
01:53:15,209 --> 01:53:17,042
That got him worried and..

1477
01:53:22,876 --> 01:53:23,917
Love story.

1478
01:53:25,584 --> 01:53:26,584
Right?

1479
01:53:30,876 --> 01:53:35,001
Please, you can keep this..

1480
01:53:35,459 --> 01:53:37,459
What's this?
- And let him go. - No.

1481
01:53:37,542 --> 01:53:40,959
And let him go. - What's this? No.

1482
01:53:41,042 --> 01:53:46,334
It won't happen again.
I promise you, and..

1483
01:53:49,709 --> 01:53:58,167
"It's you."

1484
01:53:59,001 --> 01:54:06,251
"it's you."

1485
01:54:39,667 --> 01:54:41,584
We'll go far away.

1486
01:54:44,292 --> 01:54:46,251
Where no one knows us.

1487
01:54:47,542 --> 01:54:54,334
I'll finish the contracts
that I signed, and leave.

1488
01:54:55,917 --> 01:54:58,917
Without Rahul,
I don't want anything.

1489
01:55:00,209 --> 01:55:04,042
I wanted to be successful..

1490
01:55:04,084 --> 01:55:08,542
...but not at this price.

1491
01:55:10,667 --> 01:55:12,334
Not by losing him.

1492
01:55:15,751 --> 01:55:17,959
You don't fall sick
along with the patient.

1493
01:55:20,167 --> 01:55:21,167
Dear.

1494
01:55:22,834 --> 01:55:24,834
If your love was his cure..

1495
01:55:26,501 --> 01:55:29,167
...then why didn't it work yet?

1496
01:55:32,001 --> 01:55:34,084
He's dependent on his habits.

1497
01:55:35,001 --> 01:55:36,001
His flaws.

1498
01:55:38,001 --> 01:55:40,459
He doesn't want to get anywhere.

1499
01:55:41,459 --> 01:55:44,542
So, where will you take him?

1500
01:55:45,209 --> 01:55:46,209
Not me.

1501
01:55:49,292 --> 01:55:53,376
He'll take me, in his world.

1502
01:55:54,667 --> 01:55:56,417
The place where he
stays day and night.

1503
01:55:56,876 --> 01:55:58,167
And he's happy-

1504
01:55:59,167 --> 01:56:01,626
His habits will be mine.

1505
01:56:02,792 --> 01:56:04,417
His flaws will be mine.

1506
01:56:05,042 --> 01:56:06,876
He cannot leave them, but..

1507
01:56:08,751 --> 01:56:10,376
I can take them up.

1508
01:56:12,084 --> 01:56:17,042
If this poison is his first love,
then I'll accept it too.

1509
01:56:19,126 --> 01:56:22,292
I'll stagger along with him.

1510
01:56:29,917 --> 01:56:33,917
Then, I might find
him at some point.

1511
01:56:35,751 --> 01:56:37,834
He might get fed up of his habits.

1512
01:56:38,292 --> 01:56:42,917
He might come back and say "Aarohi,
I am tired".

1513
01:56:45,751 --> 01:56:48,584
Then I'll say "Come..

1514
01:56:50,417 --> 01:56:51,792
...let's go home."

1515
01:56:53,876 --> 01:56:54,959
And, he'll come back.

1516
01:56:56,584 --> 01:56:57,959
We'll come back, uncle.

1517
01:57:02,501 --> 01:57:06,042
You've gone crazy.

1518
01:57:07,084 --> 01:57:09,834
You don't know what you're saying.

1519
01:58:20,167 --> 01:58:21,667
When did you get UP?

1520
01:58:25,376 --> 01:58:26,834
You kept crying all night.

1521
01:58:31,126 --> 01:58:32,751
My love's made you sad.

1522
01:58:36,501 --> 01:58:41,459
I was crying,
because I was missing you.

1523
01:58:41,876 --> 01:58:42,917
I am right here.

1524
01:58:47,501 --> 01:58:48,626
Just like that.

1525
01:58:55,126 --> 01:58:56,251
Come closer.

1526
01:59:04,584 --> 01:59:06,292
I came here to tell you.

1527
01:59:09,126 --> 01:59:10,792
You can cry all you want.

1528
01:59:12,834 --> 01:59:14,626
Your days of crying are over.

1529
01:59:15,042 --> 01:59:17,001
I'll leave everything, Aarohi.

1530
01:59:18,167 --> 01:59:20,042
I'll turn over a new leaf for you.

1531
01:59:20,501 --> 01:59:22,126
Everything will be fine.

1532
01:59:22,376 --> 01:59:23,417
You and me.

1533
01:59:25,209 --> 01:59:26,751
You'll help me, won't you?

1534
01:59:32,376 --> 01:59:34,792
Have I ever said no? - No.

1535
01:59:39,001 --> 01:59:41,292
The day I saw you first,
I realized..

1536
01:59:42,751 --> 01:59:45,167
...why you came in my life.

1537
01:59:46,251 --> 01:59:47,876
You've loved me a lot.

1538
01:59:48,334 --> 01:59:50,084
Given me a lot of things.

1539
01:59:50,292 --> 01:59:53,167
I gave you what was easy for me.

1540
01:59:54,042 --> 01:59:57,834
You endured my difficulties,
my betrayal.

1541
01:59:58,792 --> 02:00:00,834
Divided love.

1542
02:00:03,584 --> 02:00:05,459
And I couldn't give
you your right place.

1543
02:00:07,667 --> 02:00:09,167
But all that's going to change now.

1544
02:00:09,417 --> 02:00:11,126
Right now. From this moment.

1545
02:00:11,709 --> 02:00:13,959
Because Aarohi,
lam going to join a gym.

1546
02:00:15,334 --> 02:00:17,251
That's going to
be my daily program.

1547
02:00:17,667 --> 02:00:20,001
Gym in the morning,
jogging in the evening.

1548
02:00:20,376 --> 02:00:22,001
Proper diet. Aarohi.

1549
02:00:22,334 --> 02:00:23,334
Really?

1550
02:00:23,542 --> 02:00:25,459
Will you really.. - Yes.

1551
02:00:26,834 --> 02:00:28,126
This time I am serious, Aarohi.

1552
02:00:28,209 --> 02:00:29,501
Like I never was.

1553
02:00:31,667 --> 02:00:32,751
I am going.

1554
02:00:33,501 --> 02:00:35,584
Keep the food ready,
and wait for me.

1555
02:00:35,751 --> 02:00:36,751
Miss me.

1556
02:00:37,501 --> 02:00:38,501
Rahul.

1557
02:00:50,126 --> 02:00:52,584
I love you.

1558
02:00:55,209 --> 02:00:56,792
Come on.

1559
02:00:59,542 --> 02:01:00,959
I'll change all this.

1560
02:01:11,126 --> 02:01:12,126
Aarohi.

1561
02:01:13,042 --> 02:01:14,042
What?

1562
02:01:16,292 --> 02:01:17,292
Nothing.

1563
02:01:20,334 --> 02:01:21,626
Just like that.

1564
02:01:22,167 --> 02:01:29,251
"Forget me.
This is my final goodbye."

1565
02:01:29,459 --> 02:01:35,334
"You've to live on.. without me.

1566
02:01:36,626 --> 02:01:43,584
"This is your journey, your path."

1567
02:01:44,042 --> 02:01:49,917
"You've to live on.. without me.

1568
02:01:51,042 --> 02:01:58,084
"I pray you attain fame."

1569
02:01:58,334 --> 02:02:05,209
"I pray you're blessed
with all the grace."

1570
02:02:05,751 --> 02:02:12,042
"You've to live on.. without me.

1571
02:02:13,001 --> 02:02:19,917
"Forget me.
This is my final goodbye."

1572
02:02:20,334 --> 02:02:26,584
"You've to live on.. without me.

1573
02:02:28,542 --> 02:02:32,084
"You're my shore, my support."

1574
02:02:32,167 --> 02:02:35,542
"You're the tune in my heart,
my saga."

1575
02:02:35,792 --> 02:02:41,667
"Be your own God."

1576
02:02:44,001 --> 02:02:47,167
"lam like evening that's fading."

1577
02:02:47,626 --> 02:02:50,876
"You're the new dawn."

1578
02:02:51,251 --> 02:02:57,126
"You've to live on.. without me.

1579
02:02:58,542 --> 02:03:04,459
"You've to live on.. without me.

1580
02:03:26,126 --> 02:03:28,667
Sir, one body found in water.

1581
02:03:29,501 --> 02:03:32,167
And Ambulance will
come for take the body.

1582
02:03:54,626 --> 02:03:56,334
Aarohi dear listen. - Aarohi.

1583
02:03:56,459 --> 02:03:58,251
Aarohi where are you going?

1584
02:03:58,376 --> 02:04:01,001
Aarohi dear listen. - Aarohi.

1585
02:04:01,084 --> 02:04:04,417
Aarohi don't

1586
02:04:04,542 --> 02:04:06,417
Aarohi - where are you going.

1587
02:04:37,001 --> 02:04:38,001
Coward!

1588
02:04:45,292 --> 02:04:46,292
Coward!

1589
02:04:54,792 --> 02:04:55,792
Coward!

1590
02:04:56,792 --> 02:04:59,834
Coward! Coward! Coward!

1591
02:05:00,751 --> 02:05:01,751
Coward!

1592
02:05:02,042 --> 02:05:03,167
Coward!

1593
02:05:07,251 --> 02:05:11,292
"It's you."

1594
02:05:16,626 --> 02:05:21,709
"it's you."

1595
02:05:38,584 --> 02:05:39,917
Where are you going?

1596
02:05:43,959 --> 02:05:44,959
Anywhere?

1597
02:05:48,542 --> 02:05:49,417
What do you mean?

1598
02:05:49,501 --> 02:05:50,834
I mean far away.

1599
02:05:53,084 --> 02:05:54,459
I'm leaving everything.

1600
02:05:55,126 --> 02:05:56,626
But, that's not what Rahul wanted?

1601
02:05:58,251 --> 02:05:59,626
Rahul who?

1602
02:06:00,251 --> 02:06:02,501
I don't know any
person by that name.

1603
02:06:03,084 --> 02:06:07,292
Aarohi, decisions taken in a rage,
always hurt in the end.

1604
02:06:08,959 --> 02:06:13,001
For the first time,
my decision hasn't hurt me.

1605
02:06:13,751 --> 02:06:14,751
Good.

1606
02:06:15,751 --> 02:06:16,751
Very good.

1607
02:06:18,042 --> 02:06:19,042
Please go.

1608
02:06:20,501 --> 02:06:22,042
He should fade away.

1609
02:06:22,792 --> 02:06:24,417
Die inside you.

1610
02:06:25,792 --> 02:06:27,251
He was worth that.

1611
02:06:32,167 --> 02:06:34,001
I tried stopping him.

1612
02:06:35,084 --> 02:06:36,542
But he didn't stop.

1613
02:06:38,042 --> 02:06:39,042
He said..

1614
02:06:40,459 --> 02:06:42,876
"This is it".

1615
02:06:44,751 --> 02:06:48,459
He sold your art,
like your secretary.

1616
02:06:50,001 --> 02:06:53,334
The little life that he had,
was just for you.

1617
02:06:54,501 --> 02:06:57,084
But my friend died,
the day he hurt you.

1618
02:06:59,626 --> 02:07:01,376
The day he raised his hand on you.

1619
02:07:02,709 --> 02:07:04,459
The day he saw you
at the police station.

1620
02:07:05,626 --> 02:07:06,626
He knew.

1621
02:07:08,626 --> 02:07:10,959
Drinking was his weakness.

1622
02:07:12,042 --> 02:07:13,834
He had become your weakness.

1623
02:07:14,917 --> 02:07:17,167
The biggest obstruction
in your path.

1624
02:07:20,667 --> 02:07:22,334
And so, he gave his life.

1625
02:07:23,667 --> 02:07:25,042
So that you can live.

1626
02:07:25,834 --> 02:07:28,042
So that,
you don't become another Jayekar.

1627
02:07:28,584 --> 02:07:31,084
But you know what, he failed.

1628
02:07:31,667 --> 02:07:32,959
My friend lost.

1629
02:07:34,334 --> 02:07:36,876
You turned out to
be another Rahul Jayekar.

1630
02:08:17,626 --> 02:08:23,209
"The place where
buds will blossom."

1631
02:08:24,792 --> 02:08:30,709
"That's where you'll find me."

1632
02:08:32,126 --> 02:08:37,834
"The place that'll
remind you of my loyalty."

1633
02:08:39,501 --> 02:08:45,459
"That's where you'll find me."

1634
02:08:46,709 --> 02:08:53,709
"I'll come see you, I promise you."

1635
02:08:54,001 --> 02:09:01,209
"I'll always be with you,
I promise you."

1636
02:09:01,501 --> 02:09:07,626
"You've to live on.. without me.

1637
02:09:08,126 --> 02:09:10,417
Aarohi ma'am, I'm a big fan.

1638
02:09:10,501 --> 02:09:12,167
Can I have your autograph, please?

1639
02:09:26,709 --> 02:09:27,459
Thank you.

1640
02:09:27,542 --> 02:09:29,417
Thank you, ma'am.

Wow! but Aarohi rahul Jayekar.

"You're my life."

1645

"You're my love."

"You and I share a strange bond."

"We can't stay away a moment."

1649

"I live only for you."

1650

"All my time is devoted to you."

1651
02:10:44,334 --> 02:10:49,209
"I can't live a
moment without you."

1652
02:10:49,459 --> 02:10:56,126
"Each breath's just for you."

1653
02:10:57,251 --> 02:11:02,209
"Because it's you.. it's you."
