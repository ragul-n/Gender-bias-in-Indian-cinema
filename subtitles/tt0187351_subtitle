1
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:30,166
Mr. Munshi. What happened?
and asked me to come urgently!

2
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,924
Sir, don't know whose evil eyes
have fallen on our palace?

3
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,209
2 yrs hack, the Queen Mother expired. And now

4
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,284
Now what?

5
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,480
The younger master
and daughter-in-law too !

6
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,281
What? What happened
to Rajeev and Rajni?

7
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,689
While going to Shimla, in a car accident

8
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,571
God! Mr. Nlunshi, how did
all this happen?

9
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,766
The younger master and
daughter-in-law were going in their car.

10
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,405
Myself, the maid and baby were
following them in another car.

11
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,922
Suddenly, a tanker came from the opposite side.

12
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,488
The younger master really tried to save them.

13
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,011
But the young master's car fell
thousands of feet below in the valley.

14
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,571
By the time we reached there,
the car was already on fire.

15
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,806
One after the other, everything
got destroyed, master.

16
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,929
Mr. Nlunshi, where is the baby?

17
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,487
In the palace, master.

18
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,687
By taking away my brother, God
had cut one of my hands !

19
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,768
But after Rajeev's death, I have
experienced death while I'm still alive!

20
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,209
He had been living with us
since the last 15 years.

21
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,408
From childhood till his youth. Just like a friend.

22
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,649
That's why I had thought that,
by winding up the European business,

23
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:07,049
I would happily spend the
rest of my life with my children.

24
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,207
But don't know what God's wish was!

25
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,846
God's wish was that the way this
baby's father was brought up by you,

26
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,011
similarly, only you should bring up this child.

27
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,403
Mr. Munshi

28
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:23,804
Yes?

29
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,929
All my relatives live in the city.

30
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,560
And Rajeev's in-laws are also in this city.

31
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,245
So I want that this child should
he brought up in this city itself.

32
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,528
What do you think?

33
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,006
Now your hand is over this child.
Do whatever you think is right.

34
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,649
Ok. Make preparations to go to
the city tomorrow morning itself.

35
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,329
Ok. Fine.

36
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,365
May the king be praised!

37
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,042
How many snakes did you catch today?

38
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,129
Many of them, my Lord. You can
go and take a look inside.

39
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,089
Out of these, is there any
snake which is useful for us?

40
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,810
As per you order, my Lord, we
caught snakes from wherever we could.

41
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,242
But out of these, which one is useful and
which one is not, only you can tell us, my Lord.

42
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,688
You have been with me since
so many years, you fool!

43
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,204
And you still don't know what
I want and what I don't want?

44
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,765
You bring these useless snakes everyday and
waste mine as well as your time! You big fool!

45
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,605
My lord, it's time to worship Saint Bhairav.

46
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,449
Throw them hack from
wherever you had brought them!

47
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,650
One more thing. Today is new moon day.

48
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,967
By the next new moon day,
if you don't get that pair of snakes,

49
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,084
then I will turn you all
into snakes and put you here!

50
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,323
Is the hath over?

51
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,323
Yes, my Lord.

52
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,205
We have given him a hath with milk.
You could perform the rest of the ceremony.

53
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,529
My Lord, today is your
20th death anniversary.

54
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,960
And for the same number of years,
I have been sitting on your seat.

55
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,724
But I swear by you that in these 20 years
I didn't get peace even for a single moment!

56
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,926
Because I know that your
death was not natural.

57
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:22,126
You had sacrificed your life in
order to get that gemstone.

58
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,761
As far as I know, it was those
two snakes only who hit you

59
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,648
the ones who used to protect
Rajni and the gemstone.

60
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,687
It was only because of them, that
you could not get that gemstone.

61
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,848
The day I sat on your seat,

62
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,162
I had vowed that till the time I don't
put that gemstone in your crown,

63
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,968
I would not even eat a single grain!

64
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,645
I know that in order to get that gemstone
I will have to catch those two snakes.

65
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,725
That's why I tell my disciples everyday
to catch thousands of snakes

66
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,410
so that somehow, I reach that
gemstone through those two snakes.

67
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,483
Today I take a swear again and say that

68
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:10,251
either that gem will he shining in your
crown by your next death anniversary.

69
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,723
Or I will kill myself!

70
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,682
Bhairav! Bhairav! Bhairav!

71
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,362
Give me the strength Master, so that
I am successful in catching those two snakes.

72
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:56,331
You hogs! It has been 18 years. You are sleeping
like Kumhakarna! Are you all working or crying?

73
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,243
Work fast.

74
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,011
Mr. Nlunshi, don't worry.
Think that everything is over.

75
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,161
Think that everything is over!

76
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,731
When everything will he over only
then will I think that it's over, isn't it?

77
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,445
You have finished here.
Now go and work there.

78
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,087
When everything will he over
only then will I think that it's over.

79
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,528
When everything will he over only
then will I think that it's over, isn't it?

80
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:10,768
Oh! A snake!

81
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,966
Kill it!

82
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,650
Move aside. Do you want to
break the statue worth Rs.5000?

83
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,410
Mr. Nlunshi, it will bite.

84
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,643
What will he bite? The poor
thing is a non-violent snake.

85
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,129
I have been seeing it since many years. Poor thing!
It comes peacefully and also goes away peacefully.

86
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,401
Look, how peacefully it is going hack.

87
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,287
Now you all also go. Go!
Go and do your own work.

88
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:43,846
Go. You don't go. You come.
Roopmati. You don't run.

89
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:49,845
Even if it bites you and you die, what
difference will it make to your husband?

90
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:56,128
He is least bothered. But the one who is bothered
about you, you are not bothered about him.

91
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,122
Oh! Least bothered!

92
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:01,411
Mr. Nlunshi, you have become old.
But still there is vulgarity in your eyes.

93
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,808
Do one thing. Tell Maya to
clean mistress's room properly.

94
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,721
Mr. Raja and his daughter
must he reaching any minute.

95
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,000
Come.

96
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,568
How are you, Mr. Nlunshi?

97
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,129
How are you all?

98
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,123
Everything is fine, master.

99
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:23,683
Come, daughter.

100
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,889
She looks like the younger mistress.

101
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,207
It seems today that after 18 years, the younger
mistress has come hack again to this palace.

102
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,000
She is just like her mother.

103
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,122
Come, sir. Come. - Come.

104
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,922
There is no lift. But there are stairs
here. But they are here, aren't they?

105
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,167
Neelam, this is your own palace.

106
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,283
Here that

107
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,682
Greetings!

108
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,602
You are Gayatri, isn't it?

109
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,211
Yes. You recognized me?

110
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,327
I thought that since we are meeting after so
many years. maybe you will not recognize me.

111
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,809
How will I not recognize you?
Memory is my only strong point.

112
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,924
Neelam. This is Gayatri aunty.

113
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:07,439
Greetings!

114
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,568
Do you know Mr. Ajay Singh?
She is his only sister.

115
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,683
In our childhood, we used
to play together here.

116
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,524
Mr. Ajay Singh had a small daughter.
Where is she nowadays?

117
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,527
Shantiniketan. But her son
has come here these days.

118
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,806
He takes care of my brother's entire work.

119
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,483
Ok.

120
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,209
Kumar!

121
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:25,963
Kumar!

122
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:26,968
Greetings, uncle.

123
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:27,729
Take his blessings!

124
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,483
Long live, son! She was like a small doll
herself and her son has become so big!

125
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,003
Sir, Mr. Kumar's farm I worth seeing.

126
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,806
The land is just a quarter in size
of our land. But the crop is double.

127
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,290
We will go to see his farm one day.

128
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,726
Kumar Neelam.

129
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,407
Come, let's go inside, dear.

130
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:45,963
Come.

131
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,169
You come too.

132
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,766
The servants have gone inside.
Now who will remove the luggage?

133
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:54,848
I will remove it.

134
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,769
This is the palace where you were horn.

135
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:03,490
You were a year old when I
took you to the city from here.

136
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,963
Just see nature's magic! Neelam's
features are just like her mother!

137
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,007
Just the replica of her mother!

138
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:31,689
Isn't it, uncle?

139
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,004
Kumar, I couldn't see daughter-in-law.

140
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:42,406
But from the photograph it seems that Rajni,
my daughter-in-law, was just like my Neelu.

141
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,691
Where has Mr. Munshi gone?

142
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,609
Wow! What an idea! They have attached tyres to
the suitcases and made them like a bullock cart.

143
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,049
Mr. Munshi!

144
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:52,924
Yes.

145
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,726
In spite of so many servants you
yourself are bringing the luggage.

146
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,450
Is this your age to
carry so much weight?

147
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:05,001
Sir, the first thing is that I can't let
anyone carry the burden of this house.

148
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,330
And now, talking of carrying weight.
This weight is nothing, sir,

149
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,246
compared to the one that
I have to carry at home!.

150
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:18,562
My mountain-like wife and her 7 branches.
That means my 7 sister-in-laws.

151
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:23,124
For someone I have to bring studs
and for someone I have to bring earrings.

152
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,643
Ok, uncle. I will leave now.
I have some work at the farm.

153
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,609
What's the hurry? Have tea and go.

154
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,482
Some other day, uncle.

155
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,682
All right! We will sit and talk at leisure.

156
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,166
Do come home sometime.

157
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:35,769
Yes, I will definitely come.

158
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,926
Bring Neelam along with you.

159
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,405
Oh, sure ! Nice meeting you!

160
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,089
Nice meeting you !

161
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:39,843
Ok, Neelam.

162
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,887
May you live long!
Greetings, aunty.

163
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,804
Grandfather, for how many
days do you plan to stay here?

164
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:48,524
Me?

165
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,161
Look Bittoo, now it's only you who has to take care
of this land this property and the entire business.

166
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,321
What? Me?

167
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,002
My God! Grandfather, I won't he able
to stay in this village for many days.

168
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,845
If it is 2,4 days, then it is different.

169
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,651
Look Bittoo, now you have to
stay here for your entire life.

170
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,083
In this jungle? Impossible!

171
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,771
Grandfather, if you want,
you can stay here.

172
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,646
Mr. Nlunshi, after 2- 4 days make
preparations for my going hack.

173
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,445
I can't stay here. No way!

174
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,529
Neelu dear, what's the matter?
What happened?

175
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:50,489
Grandfather, forgive me.

176
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,281
Forgive you? For what?

177
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:59,048
I shouldn't have spoken to you
so rudely about staying here.

178
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,369
I have already forgotten that.

179
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,481
Oh mad girl! I am living
only for your happiness.

180
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,800
If you are not happy staying here
then even I am not happy.

181
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,930
Really grandfather? You are not angry, isn't?

182
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,320
Oh dear! If a friend gets angry with
a friend then what is a friend for?

183
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,607
Ok. Now sleep like a good child.

184
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,089
Come.

185
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,370
Goodnight grandfather.
Goodnight dear.

186
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,323
What has this happened?

187
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,602
What is this strange light that
has shot past like an arrow 7

188
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,204
Maybe there is a shooting star
somewhere or lightning has fallen.

189
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,843
But there would have been some
noise, if it had been lightning!

190
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:02,044
Then this lightning? Is this
the light of the gemstone?

191
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,964
Yes, this is the light
of the gemstone. Gem.

192
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,363
Who are you? What are
doing here late at night?

193
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,801
Move out of my way.

194
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,767
'I am your enemy.
You are my enemy.'

195
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,483
'I am a she-snake and you,
a snake-charmer.'

196
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,170
'I am a she-snake and you,
a snake-charmer.'

197
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,202
Rajni? No! It has been years
since she is dead.

198
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,971
Then who is she?
Just like Rajni!

199
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,290
Is she Rajni's daughter? Yes,
it can only he her!

200
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:26,331
Otherwise, who will dare to come alone
in these lonely ruins so late in the night?

201
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:31,762
So this means that the light of the gem stone
that I saw right now. she must have also seen it.

202
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,089
She must have not only seen
the light but also the gemstone.

203
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,847
So this means that the gemstone
is somewhere around here!

204
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:45,329
I will own it.
Bhairav! Bhairav! Bhairav!

205
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:04,011
What's the matter, young mistress?
You have slept long today! Are you alright?

206
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,601
I don't know why my head
seems to he heavy.

207
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,121
I don't know what was
happening the entire night.

208
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,162
Did you see any dream?

209
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,129
Dream?

210
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,530
I don't know whether it
was a dream or the reality.

211
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,048
What had you seen?

212
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,361
I don't remember much.

213
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,685
But it was some ruins, where I..

214
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,126
Young mistress, you are also
thinking about those ruins!

215
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,402
Which ruins?

216
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,726
That one. Our old palace. I have heard that your
father used to wander about in those ruins a lot.

217
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,408
Queen Mother always used to
stop him from going there.

218
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,129
She used to say that, 'That
place is not good. Don't go there!'

219
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,963
Then why father used
to go to those ruins?

220
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,846
I don't know. Anyway, let's
not talk about ruins!

221
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,840
You freshen up yourself.
I will bring tea for you.

222
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,170
Maya.

223
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:58,530
Yes?

224
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,848
Will you do me a favour?
Just open father's room.

225
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:03,569
Yes, mistress.

226
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,524
Today when I saw those ruins,
I felt something strange.

227
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,289
I felt an unknown thing.

228
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,771
I felt as if I had some deep
relationship with that place.

229
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,802
But there was no one there.

230
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,847
But I heard such a clear sound of anklets

231
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,364
as if someone was walking
along with me!

232
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:36,969
The ruins!

233
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,564
Who is it? Who is there?

234
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,010
Why does this girl come
here again and again?

235
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,530
May be the gemstone's
attraction pulls her here.

236
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,443
This means. This means that the
gemstone is somewhere here only!

237
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,563
Bhairav! Bhairav! Bhairav!

238
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,801
Bhairav! Bhairav!

239
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:00,649
My Lord.

240
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:10,646
Now your crown will not have to
wait long for the gemstone, my Lord.

241
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:17,604
I am becoming more confident that the gemstone is
somewhere in the same place where you were killed!

242
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,483
Yes, my Lord.

243
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,091
That old temple in the ruins, where
Rajni's two black snakes had taken your life,

244
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,763
I saw a girl in that same
temple who was just like Rajni.

245
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,647
On seeing her I felt that 'This is that
girl who can reach me to the gemstone!'

246
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,611
Now I will have to gain her.
Will have to gain her.

247
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,641
But how? How, my Lord? How?

248
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:01,246
The kidnapping of Sita! Yes.
That is only the right way.

249
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,450
I will have to bring the
girl by picking her up.

250
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,444
Bhairav! Bhairav! Bhairav!

251
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,125
Greetings, my Lord! Take this.

252
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:30,209
Foolish man! I do not take
donation from servants.

253
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,209
But, my Lord

254
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:34,210
Tell the owner of this house that if she wants to
give donation, then she should come and give it herself!

255
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,809
Or else, I will return empty handed,
which will mean destruction.

256
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:38,844
Go!

257
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:42,923
Young mistress!

258
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,610
What happened?

259
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,562
Some mad saint has come. He says that he
will not take donation from a servant's hand.

260
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,929
He is indeed a strange maniac!
Give it to me. I'll give it to him.

261
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,046
Bhairav!

262
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:42,121
What happened, my lord?
Tell us, my lord!

263
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,523
Move aside!

264
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,481
LS that the Same Snake
that had bit Master?

265
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:37,281
I swear by Bhairavnath.
Now I will not leave it!

266
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,168
I should just learn about
the gemstone first!

267
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,442
After that, neither this girl will live,
and neither will her two dangerous snakes!

268
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,530
Who are you all? Where are going
inside? -I forbid you! Move aside!

269
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,564
Which one of you had gone
inside the palace?

270
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,046
We don't know. - If you don't
know, who knows it then?

271
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,491
We won't let you go inside.
Move aside! - Who are you?

272
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,169
Where is your Master?

273
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:08,970
You can't go inside.
Move aside!

274
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:23,887
When your Master regains consciousness,
tell him that Mr. Raja has strictly said that

275
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:29,167
if in the future, any of you are seen
near the palace, he will he shot dead!

276
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,163
Did you understand? Come.
Get aside!

277
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:46,684
This world will not
let me reach my goal!

278
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,607
It seems that things won't
happen the straight way.

279
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:52,405
For the last 15 years, the purpose for which
I had captured you today is the time to achieve it.

280
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:58,364
I want that gemstone. And for
acquiring it, I need your help.

281
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:02,962
You are not an ordinary being.
You are the result of my meditation,

282
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:07,889
who can do the most difficult jobs in the world!
And who is beyond the reach of any man!

283
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,888
It is possible that in order to acquire that
gemstone, you will have to kill many people.

284
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:17,208
Remove the barriers that come in your way!

285
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:24,208
One more thing. The most important link
to reach that gemstone is that girl, Neelam.

286
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:29,682
If you go through that way,
this work will he easier!

287
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:34,405
In order to fulfill my goal, you
will not have to make much effort.

288
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,171
Because I have, through my
magic created that power in you,

289
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,885
that whoever listens to your voice,
will he attracted towards you.

290
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,971
Go! All my powers are with you.

291
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:57,683
And listen!

292
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:04,004
Can you see this necklace? Every
head is empowered by my meditation.

293
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:09,211
Till the time this necklace is in
your neck, you are in my power.

294
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:13,129
And I will come to know
whatever you are doing!

295
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:20,767
If you try to cheat me, you yourself
know what will happen to you! Go.

296
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,963
Bhairav! Bhairav! Bhairav!

297
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:13,248
'The winds of spring have called me.'

298
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:42,491
'Me, the foreigner, I have returned home.'

299
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:48,571
'The thorns and the flowers have called me.'

300
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:00,891
'Me, the foreigner, I have returned home.'

301
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,963
'A sweet thought came to my mind.'

302
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,444
'A little dust flew.

303
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:51,083
A letter came for me.
A letter came for me.'

304
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:57,360
'Which caused my heart to heat!

305
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:03,646
'Me, the foreigner, I have returned home.'

306
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:09,560
'The winds of spring have called me.'

307
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:16,006
'Me, the foreigner, I have returned home.'

308
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,285
'A beautiful girl came in my dreams!

309
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:24,971
'She stole my sleep and
also took away my peace!'

310
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:30,880
'She has made it difficult for me to live.'

311
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:36,841
'When I remembered the shade of her hair.'

312
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:43,131
'Me, the foreigner, I have returned home.'

313
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:49,404
'The winds of spring have called me.'

314
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:55,206
'Me, the foreigner, I have returned home.'

315
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:38,887
'What a such a strange love story is it!'

316
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:50,811
'Not heard, neither seen, nor known!'

317
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:02,721
'The queen of my dreams!

318
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:08,806
'When your name came to my lips.'

319
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:14,966
'Me, the foreigner, I have returned home.'

320
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:20,561
'The winds of spring have called me.'

321
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:26,801
'Me, the foreigner, I have returned home.'

322
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:32,885
'The thorns and the flowers have called me.'

323
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:44,607
'Me, the foreigner, I have returned home.'

324
00:44:55,880 --> 00:45:00,283
You sing so sweetly. God has
given you such a sweet voice.

325
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:04,361
And the thing that God has
given you, no can imagine that at all.

326
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:05,364
Yes?

327
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,925
Some emperor who had seen the
beauty of our country had said that,

328
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,604
'If there is heaven on
the earth, then it is here!

329
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:21,365
And when I see you I feel that if
there is a fairy then it is you! Just you!

330
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:26,523
Who are you?

331
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:30,686
A gust of wind! Who came
from here and will go there!

332
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,771
Where do you stay?

333
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:35,642
In the hearts of all beautiful girls.

334
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:37,928
What do you do?

335
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,162
Love. With all the beautiful things.

336
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:43,646
You too are very beautiful.

337
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:50,085
I am saying the truth. I don't know whether
you have seen yourself properly or not.

338
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:58,049
But if you see from my sight you will believe it.
That no one in this world is as beautiful as you!

339
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,961
You talk well.

340
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:02,887
Where are you going?

341
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,728
Navalgadh. My mother stays there.

342
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:08,442
I am going to my house after many years.

343
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,647
You are M. Raja's
granddaughter, Neelam, isn't it?

344
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,282
How do you know?

345
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,011
I know everything about you.

346
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,410
Have you met my grandfather?

347
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,562
But when I meet him, I will definitely
tell him that his Neelam is very beautiful.

348
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:26,370
In the first meeting itself,
she has won Anand's heart.

349
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,848
So your name is Anand. Yes.

350
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,090
Ok, I'll leave now. We will meet later.

351
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:32,570
When?

352
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,202
Whenever you wish!

353
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,329
If you want to meet me, just call out!

354
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,763
I'm not the past that
I won't come hack again !

355
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:44,049
So will we meet here only tomorrow?
You will come, won't you?

356
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:46,370
Bye!-Bye!

357
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:46,969
Bye!-Bye!

358
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:57,803
Hi Aunt!

359
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:01,806
Bittoo has come. Come dear.

360
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,361
Even you are here, prince charming!

361
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:04,363
How are you?

362
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:05,362
Fine! How are you?

363
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:07,562
From where are you coming, dear?

364
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,683
Aunty, I had just gone to roam about.
But where do you stay, aunty?

365
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,087
Kumar, you were not to he seen since many days.

366
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,121
That.. - What that?
Well Kumar,

367
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,450
I have a big complaint against you.

368
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:17,964
Yes?

369
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:20,409
Bitto has come here from the
city and has become lonely.

370
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,563
Both of you are the same age.
Come sometimes and meet her.

371
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,325
Forget it, grandfather! Where
has he the time for me?

372
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,851
From tomorrow, I will
he here everyday.

373
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:31,883
Daughter, you too come home someday.

374
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,883
Definitely, aunty. Please sit.

375
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:35,730
No, dear. We have been sitting
here since quite a long time.

376
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,127
Now we will leave. You
too come home someday.

377
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:39,607
Yes. I will come with Bittoo.

378
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:40,124
Ok.

379
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:42,529
May you live long!

380
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,451
Bye, Kumar! Bye, Neelam.
See you ! - See you!

381
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:51,763
Grandfather, what kind of a
person is this Gayatri aunty?

382
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:52,529
What do you mean?

383
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,684
Isn't she flirting with you?

384
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,889
You naughty girl!

385
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,002
Balram!

386
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:02,641
I don't know where has this Balram gone!

387
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,808
Mr. Nlunshi, who is this Balram?

388
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,206
Our driver.

389
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,847
Daughter has to go to the city tomorrow.

390
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:09,688
I have to go?

391
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,571
Then what? Do I have to go?

392
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:16,045
For you, I have made arrangements
for a big ambassador car.

393
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:20,524
Behind that, I have made arrangements for a
Maruti van. Inside it, there is a mobile kitchen too!

394
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:24,771
Our daughter should not get any
trouble regarding food during the journey.

395
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:25,603
Mr. Munshi.

396
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:26,164
Yes?

397
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,651
Do you want to push me away from here?

398
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:28,124
Yes.

399
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,566
Do you have any problem with me?

400
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,771
Really Neelu? You dropped
the idea of going hack?

401
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:37,928
Who will leave such a loving
grandfather and go away?

402
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,167
Now I will stay here only.

403
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:41,489
Mr. Munshi.

404
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:41,924
Yes?

405
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,166
Cancel the programme of going.

406
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,321
Ok, its cancelled!

407
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,203
Mr. Nlunshi, did you hear that?

408
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,611
I heard it and saw it too.

409
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:52,209
For the first time, in this palace,
I have seen happiness on Bittoo's face.

410
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:55,843
And Bittoo's happiness is my
happiness. Today I will celebrate.

411
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:04,122
'Sad days cannot he spent now.'

412
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,287
Mr. Munshi.

413
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:05,930
Yes?

414
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:07,646
You are drunk!

415
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:08,642
Who me?

416
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:12,249
While spending sad days
you have drunk 7 glasses.

417
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:21,889
7! 7! This number 7 is
following me like a shadow!

418
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:30,006
7 colours in the sky, 7 seas on
the earth and in my house

419
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,728
my 7 sister-in-laws!

420
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,009
Just like 7 had words.

421
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:35,968
Mr. Nlunshi,

422
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,444
sister-in-laws are not had words.

423
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:45,088
I am not married. But I know that
sister-in-laws are half housewives.

424
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,045
Half housewives?

425
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:53,283
Carrying the burden of each one,
I've broken my hack !

426
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,287
My breath stopped where it was.

427
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,527
With lot of difficulty I had got all of them married.

428
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:05,727
I spent money and destroyed myself!

429
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:11,731
But wow! Munshi Banvarilal,
you are very lucky.

430
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,802
Behind you is Saturn (sham)

431
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:21,644
All 7 of them came hack to your house!

432
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:29,006
7 friends who are standing,
trouble me again and again!

433
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,248
Sir, get married to all 7 of them!

434
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:36,363
Mr. Nlunshi, what rubbish
are you talking?

435
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:37,487
Take one second.

436
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:38,683
Balram !

437
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,769
No, he won't do. You do it.

438
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,884
I am calling Balram the driver.

439
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:44,890
You are completely drunk!

440
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,487
He will put you in the
car and drop you home.

441
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:52,130
Home! Sir, don't send me home.

442
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:57,242
Give me life imprisonment.
That isn't a house, sir.

443
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:58,681
That is hell!

444
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:02,687
Mr. Nlunshi, a home is not
hell but heaven.

445
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:08,411
It might he heaven for you.
For me, it is hell.

446
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,329
This is the condition of my house.

447
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:16,607
My wife is a sword and this head is its shield.

448
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,847
Sir, save me from that house!

449
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,969
Give me some place at your feet.

450
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,410
Some place at your feet! At the feet!

451
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:30,246
Hey, not even on the feet?!

452
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,529
Friend, help me!

453
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:37,762
If the friend gets tired, then
we should carry the load together!

454
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,565
Friend, help me!

455
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,040
What does he think of himself?

456
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:35,965
Will I die Without him?

457
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:38,642
The whole day He made
me wait the whole day!

458
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:42,602
And he didn't come. I.. I don't need anyone.

459
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:50,205
It was a stranger who I met
on the way and who went away.

460
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,611
You meet many such people in life!

461
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:59,800
Then what is the need to
get so worried for them?

462
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:13,049
Anand!

463
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:23,721
What has this happened to me?

464
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,525
What kind of magic has he done?

465
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:33,049
Which power does he have
which is pulling me towards him?

466
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,562
'Who are you looking for,
mad snake charmer?'

467
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:03,488
'I am standing in front of you.'

468
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:18,848
'My love! Oh my enemy!

469
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:23,250
I am standing in front of you.'

470
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:59,288
'Where did you not look for me?'

471
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:09,402
'You did not see where I am.'

472
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:19,209
'You did not search your heart!'

473
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:26,008
'You took a very long time.'

474
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:30,804
'I am standing in front of you.'

475
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:33,043
'I dance to your tunes!

476
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:43,362
'I dance shamelessly!

477
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:53,487
'I feel that I dance with all my heart.'

478
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:59,922
'Let these anklets of mine break.'

479
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:04,450
'I am standing in front of you.'

480
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:51,562
'You are a sage and I am your follower.'

481
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:01,602
'Everything is yours, this beauty, this youth!'

482
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:06,648
'Your pipe is like your mistress!'

483
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:12,964
'Break this in front of me.'

484
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:17,725
'I am standing in front of you.'

485
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:28,129
'Whom are you searching,
mad snake charmer.'

486
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:33,084
'My love, O my enemy.

487
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:37,771
I am standing in front of you.'

488
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:10,050
Young mistress! What happened, young mistress?

489
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:13,287
What kind of a dream was this?

490
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:15,842
In which, there were only snakes!

491
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:17,810
Snakes? This is a very auspicious thing.

492
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:19,804
This week is the holy week of 'Shivratri'.

493
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:22,242
So the coming of snakes in the
dream is a very good thing.

494
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:25,882
Let's do one thing! Let us go to pray
to the temple of our family deity!

495
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:27,246
He is the god of snakes.

496
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:27,770
No!

497
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:31,683
I will not go to those ruins.
I get very scared.

498
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:32,727
Then let us go to the big temple.

499
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:34,849
The 'Shivratri' worship
is going on there too!

500
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,368
It is said that in these days every
girl must worship Lord Shankar

501
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:40,170
and every wish of the
heart will he fulfilled.

502
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:56,164
Neelam,

503
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:03,361
Neelam, listen to me at least!
I couldn't come that day. Actually.

504
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:04,925
I didn't ask you anything, did I?

505
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:06,088
Anand dear.

506
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:12,650
Mother, this is Neelam.
I had told you, hadn't I?

507
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:15,651
That day she had met me there.
She stays in the big palace.

508
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:17,327
In the big palace?

509
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,809
Is she Mr. Raja's grand-daughter?

510
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:20,449
Yes, mother.

511
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:21,489
Greetings.

512
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:23,287
May you live long, my dear!

513
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:27,202
As soon as Anand told me
that you stay in the big palace

514
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:30,887
I understood that you are
Princess Rajni's daughter.

515
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:33,569
You look so much like your mother!

516
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:35,321
The same big eyes,

517
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:37,041
the same features.

518
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:41,330
Have you seen my mother?

519
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:42,642
Why not, dear?

520
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:45,168
I was present for her marriage also.

521
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,841
Your grandfather was a very big landlord.

522
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:50,367
You may say that in
a way, he was a king.

523
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:53,569
And we people were the small
landlords in his estate.

524
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:57,926
Till your mother was alive,
we used to meet on festivals.

525
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:01,766
Who knows, whose evil
eye fell on the palace?

526
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:05,927
I am feeling so good to hear
about my house from you.

527
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:07,926
Please come over to
our house someday.

528
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:09,887
I will surely come, dear.

529
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:13,125
But first, you will have
to come to our house.

530
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:15,169
I will send Anand to pick you up.

531
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,326
I will come myself, aunty.

532
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:20,761
What is the need to trouble
him? Fine, aunty. I will leave.

533
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:26,283
Hey dear! Such a cold wind is blowing and
you have not worn any warm clothes!

534
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:26,764
It's really nothing!

535
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:29,570
Take this!

536
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,807
I have never seen my mother.

537
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:43,043
But after seeing you, it feels that my
mother too would have been so loving,

538
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,330
so motherly!

539
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:47,729
I'll leave.

540
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:08,609
Brother Anand!

541
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:12,802
Brother Anand, the unforeseen
has happened!

542
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:15,008
Brother, the hard work of the whole year
of us poor people has gone in vain!

543
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:15,529
What happened?

544
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:18,689
The men appointed by Mr. Kumar are
taking away all the crops from our fields.

545
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:19,369
But why?

546
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,289
We people had taken
some loan from them.

547
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:24,644
And we had promised that by selling the grains
we would repay hack every rupee of the loan.

548
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:28,083
But as soon as the crops were
harvested. their men came there.

549
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:29,566
They don't trust us at all.

550
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:32,405
They are taking away all our
grains on our bullock carts itself!

551
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:35,331
If they will take all your grains
what will you people do then?

552
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:37,050
What will your children eat?

553
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:40,045
This is what we told them. But
they aren't ready to listen at all.

554
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:42,847
Where are those people?

555
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:53,686
Where are you taking
these bullock carts?

556
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:54,881
To our master's field.

557
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:58,325
These bullock carts and the
grains belong to these people.

558
01:04:59,000 --> 01:04:59,967
Return it to them!

559
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:02,043
Sir, mind your own business!

560
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:05,809
Why are you fighting with
such a big man for these people?

561
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:07,607
Look! There he comes.

562
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:15,085
What is the matter, Keshav?
Why did you stop?

563
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:17,326
This gentleman is saying
something, master.

564
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:17,924
Say it!

565
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:21,051
Mr. Kumar, these people surely owe you money.

566
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:22,681
But at least give them some time

567
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:25,646
so that they can repay your
loan by selling their grains.

568
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:29,329
What is the guarantee that after
that they will repay hack my loan?

569
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:30,202
I give the guarantee.

570
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:31,801
Look sir, my farm is there.

571
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:33,685
There are so many grains in the field!

572
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:37,249
If these people don't return
your money then I will return it.

573
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:40,284
Fine.

574
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:42,370
You people can take your carts.

575
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:43,003
Come, brother Raghu!

576
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:44,368
Thank you, Mr. Kumar.

577
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:49,049
Who is he?

578
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:51,046
He is Aunt Shanti's son.

579
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:02,929
Even God forgives the first mistake, Neelam.

580
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:08,282
But I am human. And
humans live a hundred times.

581
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:11,127
And die a hundred times!

582
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:13,131
What does this have to do
with living and dying?

583
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:17,571
Hey! What is this? You're crying!

584
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:21,125
I didn't know that you would he so
angry on my not coming on that day.

585
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:22,880
I had not come just like that.

586
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:27,489
Someone's heart broke
and you're not even bothered !

587
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:30,891
Actually my mother had stopped me.

588
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:33,204
I met mother after so many days.

589
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:35,170
She didn't let me get out of the house.

590
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:38,643
But I promise that I will never
break your heart again!

591
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:40,284
I don't know.

592
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:43,486
I don't know what has
happened to me also!

593
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:45,886
This has never happened before.

594
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:48,606
What magic have you done?

595
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:51,886
That I got so worried to meet you!

596
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:55,329
What is there to get worried?
I keep meeting you.

597
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:59,326
You? Meeting me?
When did you meet me?

598
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:00,370
In my dreams!

599
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:02,803
In your dreams?

600
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:03,804
Yes.

601
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:09,443
This is true. We met in our dreams.

602
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:15,810
What happened?

603
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:16,804
Nothing!

604
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:17,929
Nothing!

605
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:20,569
Nothing!

606
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:21,090
Nothing?

607
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:40,241
This is such a romantic place!

608
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:43,606
In the olden days, this place
must have been very beautiful.

609
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:46,682
I heard that this was the
palace of your ancestors.

610
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:46,925
Yes.

611
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:49,044
Our ancestors lived here once.

612
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:50,249
Even your mother and father?

613
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:50,770
No.

614
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:52,286
They used to stay at the new palace.

615
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:54,683
Yet, father was very attached
to this place.

616
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:56,445
He used to come here frequently.

617
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:56,924
Why?

618
01:08:57,720 --> 01:08:58,482
I don't know that.

619
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:00,809
But his mother stopped
him from coming here

620
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:06,169
Mother was saying that it was at this place
itself that your father was bitten by a snake.

621
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:09,531
A saint had saved him.
But that snake died.

622
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:11,369
Really? I don't know.

623
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:15,482
I even came to know that
the snake had a gemstone.

624
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:18,931
And if this is true, that gemstone
should he somewhere here only.

625
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:20,204
Gemstone!

626
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:22,287
What gemstone is it?

627
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:23,328
Don't you know?

628
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:26,966
It is a very amazing thing!
Just like a magic lamp.

629
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:30,928
Whoever gets it, can become the
owner of the world's biggest treasure.

630
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:32,687
Come! Let us look for it!

631
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:40,046
Anand, I have nothing to do
with any treasure of the world.

632
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:43,970
My most valuable treasure
is in front of me.

633
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:49,210
The one who I've got
after meditating for ages !

634
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:56,083
Hey! What are you thinking?

635
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:56,810
Nothing.

636
01:09:57,240 --> 01:09:59,322
Come! Let us go to your house.
To meet your mother.

637
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:00,643
Let's go.

638
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:30,051
Hey dear! You? I cannot believe
that you have come to our house.

639
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:31,207
Don't say that, mother.

640
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:35,486
If Krishna comes to Sudama's house
Sudama will surely he surprised.

641
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:39,011
The status of Mr. Raj'sgrand
daughter is so high and look at us !

642
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:41,683
Sit dear. Sit down!

643
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:45,043
Mother. You talk to each other.
I'll freshen up and come back.

644
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:48,490
Say, dear. How are you?

645
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:49,761
I am fine. How are you?

646
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:52,010
Fine. Will you have anything?

647
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:52,569
No.

648
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:58,122
Mother, whose photograph is this?

649
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:00,202
This is Anand's photo.

650
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:02,326
When he was seven years old.

651
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:07,486
It's only with the help of this photograph,
that I have spent the last 15 years!

652
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:08,924
What does that mean?

653
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:13,565
We had gone to the 'Kumbh' fair.

654
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:16,331
It was there that we had
this photograph clicked.

655
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:26,684
My son got so lost in the crowd,
that we found him after 15 years!

656
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:29,811
You may call it a miracle!

657
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:33,208
I had lost all hopes!

658
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:36,686
You must have asked him
where was he all this while!

659
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:40,165
He says he was in
the company of saints.

660
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:43,447
And sometimes, he keeps talking
about knowledge and meditation.

661
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:48,247
I get scared that if he goes again

662
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:49,927
what will happen to me?

663
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:52,402
No, mother. Don't worry.

664
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:54,570
He will not leave you and go anywhere.

665
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:56,207
I know, dear.

666
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:58,086
He respects you a lot.

667
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:02,122
Since he has met you, he
keeps talking only about you.

668
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:07,401
I have thought that as soon as possible
I will tie him in the bond of marriage.

669
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:11,410
If you say so, should I talk to
Mr. Raja about the marriage?

670
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:16,922
What are you talking about?

671
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:18,529
Should we leave, Anand?

672
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:19,051
Fine.

673
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:20,286
How can this he possible, dear?

674
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,165
You have come to our
house for the first time.

675
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,962
I wont let you go without making
you eat something will I?

676
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:28,404
Both of you talk. I will bring
something for you to eat.

677
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:34,688
What are you looking at?

678
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:37,042
Do you know what
mother was saying?

679
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:38,242
What was mother saying?

680
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:42,721
That she will talk to grandfather
about our marriage.

681
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:43,369
Marriage!

682
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:45,447
What is the hurry?

683
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:50,451
This means mother was right.

684
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:51,848
What was mother saying?

685
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:55,289
That maybe you would leave
her and go away!

686
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:58,567
Earlier also you were missing
for last 15 years.

687
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:00,561
Where were you for so many years?

688
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:03,044
Let's forget old matters.
Come, let us is.

689
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:04,047
Don't change the topic, Anand!

690
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:12,845
Have you ever thought how mother spent
those 15 years? You are her only son.

691
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:14,525
Hey, you have started
giving a speech!

692
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:16,365
Where am I going to
go leaving mother?

693
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:21,006
Remember one thing, Anand.
Mother has no one except you.

694
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:23,241
Childhood was a different thing.

695
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:28,610
If you leave her and go now, she
may not he able to hear the shock!

696
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:37,971
Anand, before you go, you not only have to
think about your mother but also about me!

697
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:44,284
How can I leave you and go?
You are the aim of my life.

698
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:11,003
Destruction!

699
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:15,131
Anand! What happened?

700
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:21,483
I hope you are alright! Hey!
What are you looking at?

701
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:23,050
Yes.

702
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:25,689
What happened, Anand?

703
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:27,930
If you had not come into my life,

704
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:32,922
who knows till when would I have been
wandering in the darkness of my life?

705
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:44,967
This cannot happen! I will
not let this happen!

706
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:48,210
I will not let this happen!
Bhairav! Bhairav! Bhairav!

707
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:05,371
My Lord! You! Here?

708
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:06,840
Are you surprised?

709
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:12,325
Anand, do you remember that before
sending you here we had placed the holy pot?

710
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:13,922
We had worshipped it.

711
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:17,645
That holy pot has broken. The
worship has been disturbed.

712
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:21,570
You have forgotten that we people
don't get involved in worldly affairs.

713
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:23,644
Because we are saints, bachelors.

714
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:27,248
You are a bachelor. And also a saint. Not me.

715
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:29,570
I am a simple human being.

716
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:33,647
So should I think that you are revolting?

717
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:38,530
And instead of bringing Neelam to us
You have got trapped in her love?

718
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:40,127
You may think that way!

719
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:43,210
To understand this only, I hadn't
freed you from being horn as a snake.

720
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:44,881
I want that gemstone, Anand!

721
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:47,084
Which we can get only through Neelam!

722
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:49,522
And you will bring Neelam to my place.

723
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:53,320
I will never come to your place,
Gorakhnath.

724
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:56,242
And the question of bringing
Neelam doesn't even arise!

725
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:58,286
Because I love her.

726
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:00,922
And very soon, we both are
going to get married.

727
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:10,964
If you both get married, then yours
and Neelam's pair will he one in a million!

728
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:12,401
But now this isn't possible.

729
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:15,527
Because you have disturbed my meditation!

730
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:19,766
I will ruin your dreams, the
dreams of becoming a groom!

731
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:24,361
She will not live and neither
will you marry her!

732
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:33,241
If you harm Neelam even
a hit, I will kill you!

733
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:36,645
You will kill me?

734
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:44,086
You are the one who we had locked up in a
box as a snake for 15 years with our magic!

735
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:44,885
Yes.

736
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:54,087
By picking up a 7 year old kid only a hypocrite
like you can misuse his knowledge of magic!

737
01:16:55,000 --> 01:17:00,291
But now I have the strength to give a
straightforward to your hypocrisy!

738
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:06,649
How the small snake has
turned into a brave lad!

739
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:09,288
Don't feel so proud
of your youth, child.

740
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:12,526
You have no identity at all in
front of my accomplished powers!

741
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:17,443
Only one chant of mine will
melt this body of iron to water!

742
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:23,170
If you misuse the god-given powers you
yourself will burn in them and get destroyed!

743
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:28,683
And if you even look at Neelam
I will pull your eyes out!

744
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:34,844
And now, before I throw you
out along with your powers

745
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:36,648
get out from here!

746
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:39,481
Anand, my curse will destroy you!

747
01:17:57,920 --> 01:17:59,604
Now what can I hide from you, brother?

748
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:04,605
Since Neelam has come here,
Kumar doesn't go anywhere.

749
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:08,369
I feel that both have started
liking each other.

750
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:10,246
By the way, they make a good pair!

751
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:14,601
And brother, the biggest thing is
that if both the families become one.

752
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:15,442
Look, sister

753
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:17,965
in the matters of marriage,

754
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:23,281
I am not in favour of imposing any elderly
advice or unnecessary family wishes!

755
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:26,446
If those two want to spend their lives together

756
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:29,001
Its them only who must have
the right to take the final decision!

757
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:29,211
Yes.

758
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:30,248
Greetings, aunty.

759
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:31,169
May you live long!

760
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:34,881
Come dear, come. Look !
Now you yourself talk.

761
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:36,282
What kind of talk grandfather?

762
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:40,604
Dear, may he you must he knowing

763
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:45,171
that your family and my brother Ajay Singh's
family shared a very deep relationship.

764
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:47,486
Ajay really wished

765
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:52,768
that by getting Vijaya and your father married,
this relationship would become stronger!

766
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:56,167
But maybe this was not destined!

767
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:58,609
Today destiny has given us
this opportunity again.

768
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:01,288
So I want that you and
Kumar to get married.

769
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:04,083
What can I say?

770
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:10,006
Aunty just understand that may be this time too
this relationship is not agreeable to the destiny.

771
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:12,761
Grandfather, talk to aunty.
I will just come.

772
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:13,922
I will just come, aunt.

773
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:20,208
I will leave.

774
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,767
Look, don't feel had about
what children say.

775
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:24,041
I had told you before itself.

776
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:24,928
Let it be!

777
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:28,006
Don't I understand? I'll leave.

778
01:19:31,240 --> 01:19:31,684
Bittoo!

779
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:32,523
Yes, grandfather?

780
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:34,362
What is the matter,Bittoo?

781
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:37,645
You clearly refused aunt.
Don't you like Kumar?

782
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:39,603
That. That isn't the case,
grandfather.

783
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:41,169
Actually

784
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:45,087
Hey, you are shying away
from your grandfather!

785
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:45,928
What kind of a friend are you?

786
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:49,282
Does my Bittoo like some other boy?

787
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:51,168
Tell me, please.

788
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:52,324
Yes.

789
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:53,562
Who is he?

790
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:56,890
There is a good looking,
educated boy, Anand.

791
01:19:57,320 --> 01:19:58,162
That is a good name.

792
01:19:58,280 --> 01:19:59,088
The boy is also good.

793
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:00,521
By the way, they are very simple people.

794
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:02,640
Their relationship with our family

795
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:03,488
Hey silly girl!

796
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:06,490
Do we have to get you married
to the boy or to the family?

797
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:08,771
Come. Introduce him to me quickly!

798
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:09,807
Thank you, grandfather.

799
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:18,009
What happened, aunt?

800
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:21,369
I already knew that the relationship
wouldn't get fixed.

801
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:24,969
I had to go there only due to your
stubbornness and to get myself insulted!

802
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:26,361
Did Mr. Raja refuse?

803
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:27,927
Not Mr.Raja.

804
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:30,644
It was Neelam herself who refused!

805
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:35,203
I know who she is after.

806
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:41,483
Tonight I will make some
arrangements for him!

807
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:33,008
Who are you?

808
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:37,570
Brother Anand. Look, someone
is setting my field on fire !

809
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:29,689
Stop.

810
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,241
Get aside aunty. I won't
leave him alive.

811
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:40,766
I won't leave him

812
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,571
Kumar, I thought that you were a nice guy.

813
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:46,130
What enmity do you have with Anand?

814
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:49,243
That even after causing him so much
of a loss, you are ready to hit him.

815
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:51,803
Call the police.

816
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:54,449
No, brother. Forgive him.

817
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:57,287
Tomorrow itself, I will take him and
go somewhere far away from here.

818
01:24:57,880 --> 01:25:00,884
Due to this fire. whatever the losses are.
I am ready to pay for them.

819
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:02,804
It's not about losses, Gayatri.

820
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:07,007
It's about Bittoo's marriage. And I will
get her married wherever I want to.

821
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:09,961
My family is not used
to any stubbornness.

822
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:11,487
Take him away from here.

823
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:13,964
Come.

824
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:24,730
Son, you have faced a lot of losses.

825
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:27,371
Nothing to worry grandfather.
Only the crop has been burnt.

826
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:30,691
My arms and legs are intact.
The crop can he grown again.

827
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:32,888
Bravo son! Long live.

828
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:36,850
But there is only one way
to shut their mouths.

829
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:39,887
You and Bittoo should he engaged soon.

830
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:41,481
I mean to say tomorrow itself.

831
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:43,483
Mr. Raja,

832
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:45,446
we are very humble people.

833
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:50,211
But still, I give you the confidence that your
daughter will live here very comfortably.

834
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:52,609
We will see that she does not.
have any kind of trouble.

835
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:56,567
Sister Shanti, talking about
small and big is unnecessary.

836
01:25:57,040 --> 01:26:00,806
By God's grace, Bittoo has everything. The
only thing that was missing was a mother's love.

837
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:01,727
Now you have completed that.

838
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:04,009
Bittoo appreciates you a lot.

839
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:10,045
My love has made Bittoo a hit stubborn.

840
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:13,962
If at all she makes any
mistake, then come and shout at me.

841
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:15,523
Mr. Munshi.

842
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:18,489
Take this, Bittoo.

843
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:29,880
Anand, my friend is yours from now.

844
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:14,964
'From one heart they
have gone to another heart.'

845
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:23,731
'The lanes of love.'

846
01:27:26,680 --> 01:27:32,369
'On these lanes, today
have met..'

847
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:43,247
'Your eyes. My eyes!

848
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:49,166
'From one heart they
have gone to another heart.'

849
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:20,521
'How, where and when did we meet?'

850
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:34,881
'It is hurting so much.
When did we meet?'

851
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:46,326
'This heart was sighing
since many years.'

852
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:52,485
'From one heart they have
gone to another heart.'

853
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,321
'The lanes of love.'

854
01:28:58,640 --> 01:29:03,680
'From one heart they have
gone to another heart.'

855
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:32,325
'The breeze of the wind,
the waves of the water.'

856
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:43,606
'We are alone without
each other.'

857
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:49,566
'Of what use is the
weather and these fairs?'

858
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:55,047
'I will hold your hand.'

859
01:29:55,840 --> 01:30:01,131
'On these lanes, today have met..'

860
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:06,441
'Your eyes. My eyes!

861
01:30:07,160 --> 01:30:12,200
'From one heart they
have gone to another heart.'

862
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:40,010
Eyes!

863
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:49,766
'We will have to die for each other.'

864
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:52,647
'We will have to die.'

865
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:58,401
'We will have to he scared
of a had reputation.

866
01:30:58,760 --> 01:31:01,286
'We will have to he scared!

867
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:06,967
'We will have to die for each other.'

868
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:12,880
'We will have to do all the loving.'

869
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:18,691
'You love me, whether
you wish it or not.'

870
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:24,086
'From one heart they
have gone to another heart.'

871
01:31:24,160 --> 01:31:25,605
'Eyes.'

872
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:50,122
Master, you are alright,
isn't it?

873
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:05,763
Some wicked person has hit
our Master and run away.

874
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:08,321
Help us to take him
to our destination.

875
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:17,722
Look! If you help a saint,
God will help you.

876
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:19,167
Don't leave us and go!

877
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:26,641
Ok. Sit behind in the car.

878
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:42,728
Wait Anand!

879
01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:47,643
You are absolutely alright!

880
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:49,128
So that accident?

881
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:53,725
That was my magic.

882
01:32:56,280 --> 01:32:57,441
You understand magic, isn't it?

883
01:32:58,840 --> 01:32:59,921
Why will you not understand?

884
01:33:00,720 --> 01:33:04,088
You have the biggest experience
of my magical powers.

885
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:10,211
Look, Gorakhnath. Now I am not a
child who will fall prey to your magic!

886
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:13,208
In front of my strength,
your magic won't work.

887
01:33:14,360 --> 01:33:15,930
I will kill you!

888
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,764
You will kill me? You?

889
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:23,922
Whom I had, since 15 years turned into a snake with
the help of my magical knowledge and kept you here.

890
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:27,205
If I want I can send you again to the
same place where you were earlier.

891
01:33:28,280 --> 01:33:32,365
I had thought that if you complete
my work I would free you forever.

892
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:34,404
But no! You are not
deserving for this.

893
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:36,921
You have ditched me. You
have cheated Gorakhnath.

894
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:38,411
You have increased
my anger even more.

895
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:44,447
In order to acquire the gemstone, I had asked
you to fake love with Neelam and bring her here.

896
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:46,045
And not marry her!

897
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:47,925
It is not a crime to marry.

898
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:53,211
But to disobey me is a very big crime. Whose
punishment both you and Neelam have to face.

899
01:33:53,680 --> 01:33:55,409
Neelam is my wife-to-be.

900
01:33:56,040 --> 01:33:57,883
If you harm even a single strand of her hair,

901
01:33:58,360 --> 01:34:02,809
then remember neither will you
exist and nor this den of treachery!

902
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:06,447
I will set fire to everything
and turn it to ashes.

903
01:34:06,720 --> 01:34:08,324
You are talking too much, you fool!

904
01:34:08,720 --> 01:34:11,485
Now you can't escape.
Now no one can save you.

905
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:13,086
Bhairav! Bhairav!

906
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:07,611
Bhairav! Bhairav! Bhairav!

907
01:36:21,240 --> 01:36:22,924
Mother, you have not
slept as yet?

908
01:36:23,080 --> 01:36:24,081
It's going to be 12 o'clock.

909
01:36:24,640 --> 01:36:25,801
Anand has not come hack yet.

910
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:27,522
I don't know where
he has got detained.

911
01:36:28,640 --> 01:36:30,927
He was saying that for the farm, he
will bring the medicines and the fertilizers

912
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:32,325
from the city and return by the evening.

913
01:36:32,760 --> 01:36:36,242
Do one thing, Dinu. Go to the palace.
Maybe Neelam knows something.

914
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:38,005
Ok, mother. I will find out.

915
01:36:54,360 --> 01:36:54,883
Mother.

916
01:36:55,360 --> 01:36:56,009
Neelam dear.

917
01:36:56,160 --> 01:36:58,049
Mother. Did you learn
anything about him?

918
01:36:58,320 --> 01:36:58,969
No dear.

919
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:01,081
After all, where could he have gone?

920
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:02,521
I can't understand anything.

921
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:04,371
I am getting scared.

922
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:06,050
What's there to get so scared 7

923
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:08,841
It may he possible that the he has
stayed in the city for some important work.

924
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:09,604
Mr. Munshi.

925
01:37:09,640 --> 01:37:09,970
Yes?

926
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:11,645
Send some friends immediately
and try to find out.

927
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:12,283
Ok. Fine.

928
01:37:17,160 --> 01:37:17,524
What?

929
01:37:18,680 --> 01:37:20,603
Are you in too much trouble? Yes?

930
01:37:21,640 --> 01:37:23,085
You've got so scared in four days?

931
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:28,691
Did you see the consequences
of fighting Gorakhnath?

932
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:35,489
Now there is only suffering written in your
destiny and only crying written in Neelam's destiny.

933
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:22,004
I know that you people are
very worried because of Neelam.

934
01:38:23,240 --> 01:38:27,768
Till I was alive you people used to
he worried about me just like this.

935
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:32,964
No one knows how many times you
have risked your lives to save my life.

936
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:38,246
I also know that you will not let
Neelam get harmed even a hit.

937
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:40,730
But you also have certain limitations.

938
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:42,891
Gorakhnath is a very accomplished man.

939
01:38:44,120 --> 01:38:45,690
You cannot fight him for many days.

940
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:51,003
So I want you to make Neelam
touch that gemstone at once!

941
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:52,881
She will touch that gemstone.

942
01:38:53,480 --> 01:38:56,484
All those powers will themselves come into her

943
01:38:57,160 --> 01:38:58,047
which were within me.

944
01:38:58,680 --> 01:39:03,049
On gaining those powers, Neelam
can face Gorakhnath in every way.

945
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:06,290
Go. My blessings are with you.

946
01:40:45,120 --> 01:40:47,122
'Eyes!

947
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:10,485
Hey! Who is coming?

948
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:13,367
Whom do you want to meet?

949
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:15,002
You cannot go inside!

950
01:41:15,320 --> 01:41:16,401
Women are not supposed to go inside.

951
01:42:16,840 --> 01:42:18,330
Neelam, how did you come here?

952
01:42:18,360 --> 01:42:19,486
Let us leave from here. Quickly.

953
01:42:24,160 --> 01:42:25,446
'Eyes!'

954
01:42:45,560 --> 01:42:47,289
That girl is silly!

955
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:53,569
She doesn't know with whom she
is fighting! Bhairav! Bhairav!

956
01:42:55,680 --> 01:43:00,891
The intensity of my anger will
turn both of them into ashes.

957
01:43:01,640 --> 01:43:06,123
I wouldn't even he able to imagine that you
would come into my life for any selfish reason!

958
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:09,245
Neelam, I don't have any
selfish reason in this.

959
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:14,926
I myself am thankful to you that
because of you I got freed from Gorakhnath.

960
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:18,164
How are you related to Gorakhnath?

961
01:43:18,760 --> 01:43:21,411
This is my life's hidden past.

962
01:43:22,440 --> 01:43:25,922
When I was seven years old,
Gorakhnath kidnapped me from the fair.

963
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:29,609
When I gained consciousness
I found myself in a graveyard

964
01:43:30,120 --> 01:43:31,645
where Gorakhnath was meditating.

965
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:37,042
I felt that by sacrificing my life
he will complete his meditation. But.

966
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:38,889
But what?

967
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:40,646
But he didn't sacrifice my life.

968
01:43:41,560 --> 01:43:44,086
In fact, he made me lie down in
the graveyard in between the skulls,

969
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:47,770
and by throwing black powder
on me he started reciting chants.

970
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:49,686
My body started stiffening.

971
01:43:50,240 --> 01:43:56,964
I became unconscious and he, with his magic
he turned me into a snake and closed me in a box.

972
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:01,724
I was closed in that box
for an entire 15 years.

973
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:06,724
I had lost hope that some day
I would go home and meet my mother.

974
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:12,560
But suddenly one day, Gorakhnath made me a
medium of his selfish knowledge and sent me to you.

975
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:17,001
So you.. So you came to
take the gemstone from me?

976
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:21,683
I had definitely come to you. but it's not me
it's Gorakhnath who wants the gemstone.

977
01:44:22,600 --> 01:44:26,525
In fact, after meeting you, I just dropped
the intention of handing you over to him.

978
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:30,000
Because the troubles that I
have suffered from that sorcerer,

979
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:32,449
I don't want .you to also suffer those troubles!

980
01:44:33,080 --> 01:44:37,608
So with his magic, he caught me again.

981
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:43,566
And now for me to live, I will
have to kill Gorakhnath.

982
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:49,087
No Anand. I don't want you to kill any saint.

983
01:44:49,360 --> 01:44:52,364
You don't know Neelam, by killing
him many people will he saved!

984
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:56,368
For completing his meditation,
how many lives has he sacrificed!

985
01:44:57,160 --> 01:45:00,960
And to get the gemstone, I don't know
how many more lives will he sacrifice!

986
01:45:03,120 --> 01:45:04,485
He will not get that gemstone Anand.

987
01:45:05,640 --> 01:45:08,928
Even if he sacrifices his own life for it!

988
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:11,881
Neelam, I didn't understand one thing.

989
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:15,483
How did you free me? From
where did you get this power?

990
01:45:18,640 --> 01:45:20,529
All this is the result of
my mother's blessings.

991
01:45:21,880 --> 01:45:25,805
If you want, I can take
you to that gemstone now.

992
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:28,607
No Neelam. I don't want the gemstone.

993
01:45:29,360 --> 01:45:34,571
Because whoever has gained this gemstone he has
not been alive to enjoy the benefits of the gemstone.

994
01:45:36,280 --> 01:45:40,604
Goraknath's teacher Master Bhairav Nath
had struggled all his life to get the gemstone.

995
01:45:41,160 --> 01:45:44,243
And when he got near the gemstone,
the snakes hit him.

996
01:45:44,640 --> 01:45:45,289
And he died.

997
01:45:46,160 --> 01:45:47,969
Your mother too couldn't enjoy
the benefits of the gemstone.

998
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:51,411
She too died in a car accident with your father.

999
01:45:52,240 --> 01:45:54,322
And the biggest example is Lord Krishna.

1000
01:45:55,280 --> 01:45:57,760
He also died because of a gemstone.

1001
01:45:58,480 --> 01:46:02,041
How did you come to know all this?

1002
01:46:03,560 --> 01:46:05,289
By living with Gorakhnath for 15 years

1003
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:07,808
the good and the had,
I have learn't many things.

1004
01:46:08,240 --> 01:46:11,642
And after knowing all this, which silly
man would try to get the gemstone?

1005
01:46:12,520 --> 01:46:17,208
Neelam, after getting you, I don't
want anything else in the world.

1006
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:20,562
And you are the most valuable thing.

1007
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:26,608
Anand, let us go home. Mother
is very worried about you.

1008
01:46:27,040 --> 01:46:27,370
Come!

1009
01:46:34,760 --> 01:46:37,445
Where had you gone, dear? For so many
days and without saying anything?

1010
01:46:37,680 --> 01:46:39,523
You had scared all of us.

1011
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:41,246
I had gone to the City, grandfather.

1012
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:45,161
Some friends stopped me there and
I didn't have any means to inform you.

1013
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:46,930
What kind of friends do you have?

1014
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:47,961
Who are more dear to
you than your mother is!

1015
01:46:48,240 --> 01:46:49,685
Hey, can anyone he dearer
than a mother?

1016
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:53,163
Now please forgive me. From now on I
wont go anywhere without informing you.

1017
01:46:53,560 --> 01:46:56,484
Sister, if you don't mind, can I say something?

1018
01:46:57,200 --> 01:46:58,406
Yes. Say it.

1019
01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:01,651
Now get these two married soon.

1020
01:47:01,880 --> 01:47:03,450
Otherwise, he will keep running this way only.

1021
01:47:03,960 --> 01:47:06,327
I have found an auspicious Day.
it's this full moon's day itself.

1022
01:47:06,680 --> 01:47:09,445
A saint was saying that this
day is very auspicious.

1023
01:47:09,680 --> 01:47:11,762
Hey, if its auspicious for you,
then its auspicious for us too!

1024
01:47:11,960 --> 01:47:12,768
No!

1025
01:47:14,840 --> 01:47:20,006
Teasing Gorakhnath means putting
your hand into a lion's mouth!

1026
01:47:21,480 --> 01:47:23,323
I swear by you, Master,

1027
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:27,121
that if I don't turn the fire of
Anand and Neelam's marriage

1028
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:32,688
into the fire of their death, then
my name too is not Gorakhnath!

1029
01:49:36,760 --> 01:49:41,209
No, Master! I cannot accept defeat!

1030
01:49:41,800 --> 01:49:42,881
Dear Gorakhnath.

1031
01:49:43,200 --> 01:49:43,610
Who is it?

1032
01:49:44,440 --> 01:49:45,407
Who is it? Come in front of me!

1033
01:49:46,200 --> 01:49:50,000
I am near you only, dear.
In your own heart.

1034
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:52,245
Your master, Bhairav Nath.

1035
01:49:56,440 --> 01:49:57,851
Salutations, Master!

1036
01:49:58,720 --> 01:50:02,167
Look. Look at what state have
they rendered your student in!

1037
01:50:02,880 --> 01:50:04,644
But I swear by you, Bhairav Nath

1038
01:50:05,360 --> 01:50:06,850
I too will never leave them alive!

1039
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:07,927
I will never will leave them alive!

1040
01:50:08,280 --> 01:50:10,282
Leave this useless stubbornness
Gorakhnath.

1041
01:50:10,520 --> 01:50:11,681
And forgive the children.

1042
01:50:11,720 --> 01:50:14,326
No! Never!

1043
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:18,761
This battle cannot get over
so easily, Master! It cannot!

1044
01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:21,760
I too was fighting till my last breath.

1045
01:50:22,280 --> 01:50:27,923
But one such moment also came when I
realised my mistake and I forgave Rajni.

1046
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:31,009
You must have! You must have
accepted defeat, Master!

1047
01:50:31,560 --> 01:50:34,211
But I am not weak like you.
I am a stubborn saint.

1048
01:50:34,600 --> 01:50:36,682
Even the greatest power cannot
break my stubbornness.

1049
01:50:37,360 --> 01:50:39,362
Try to understand, Gorakhnath.

1050
01:50:40,120 --> 01:50:44,887
Your stubbornness and your chanting
are useless in front of that divine power,

1051
01:50:45,160 --> 01:50:48,164
which Neelam keeps
getting from the snakes.

1052
01:50:48,720 --> 01:50:50,961
That power is nothing less
than Lord Brahma's weapon!

1053
01:50:51,080 --> 01:50:53,765
I have decided that I will conduct a grand
prayer ceremony for powers, Master.

1054
01:50:54,080 --> 01:50:57,050
And will take into my subjection
those two protectors of that gemstone!

1055
01:50:57,960 --> 01:51:02,329
Who will bring Anand and Neelam here
on a single command from me!

1056
01:51:02,600 --> 01:51:07,208
Then see how that gem reaches me
on it's own, Master. On it's own!

1057
01:51:07,680 --> 01:51:11,321
All this isn't so easy, dear,
the way you think it to he.

1058
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:17,607
This isn't Bhairav Nath,
Master. It is Gorakhnath.

1059
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:23,688
Once my eyes fall on some thing,
either I gain it or I burn it to ashes!

1060
01:51:24,120 --> 01:51:25,770
Listen to one more thing.

1061
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:32,487
Until now I was idolizing you. But today I came to
know that you were an ordinary and weak saint

1062
01:51:32,520 --> 01:51:34,249
who accepted defeat in front of a girl.

1063
01:51:34,760 --> 01:51:39,482
So from today, I will stop singing your praises
and start the grand prayer ceremony for powers.

1064
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:41,522
Hail Gorakhnath!

1065
01:52:19,280 --> 01:52:20,202
Grant me a boon, mother!

1066
01:52:20,920 --> 01:52:25,005
Let there he fire in order
for you to accept my offering.

1067
01:52:27,040 --> 01:52:28,041
Let there he fire!

1068
01:52:35,720 --> 01:52:42,410
Mother, by accepting my offering you have made
this worshipper get included in the category of gods.

1069
01:52:43,120 --> 01:52:48,650
You have given me that power, which can destroy
every obstacle between me and the gemstone.

1070
01:52:50,080 --> 01:52:53,289
Mother, your worshipper has been cheated.

1071
01:52:54,040 --> 01:52:56,168
Neelam has challenged my
knowledge and accomplishment.

1072
01:52:56,440 --> 01:52:57,851
And Anand has betrayed me.

1073
01:52:59,280 --> 01:53:01,647
Anand must get the punishment for his deeds.

1074
01:53:02,360 --> 01:53:05,887
But I wont kill him.
Someone else will.

1075
01:53:06,080 --> 01:53:08,924
And I must get its benefit mother. I

1076
01:53:13,200 --> 01:53:16,966
No! I will not let this happen!

1077
01:53:18,520 --> 01:53:23,003
To protect my husband I
will put my life on stake.

1078
01:53:24,240 --> 01:53:27,164
I will always have to
he with him. Always!

1079
01:53:35,560 --> 01:53:36,800
What is the latest news?

1080
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:38,850
The latest news is that

1081
01:53:39,880 --> 01:53:45,046
a beautiful girl struck a simple boy like lightning.
and that poor boy doesn't belong anywhere!

1082
01:53:45,120 --> 01:53:45,643
Really?

1083
01:53:45,680 --> 01:53:46,249
Yes.

1084
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:48,962
That poor boy doesn't feel
like doing any work.

1085
01:53:49,760 --> 01:53:51,888
He feels like sitting
with her all day long!

1086
01:53:52,240 --> 01:53:52,729
Really?

1087
01:53:53,120 --> 01:53:53,689
Yes Neelam.

1088
01:53:54,920 --> 01:53:58,481
Today you have truly come
with the intention of killing me!

1089
01:53:59,360 --> 01:54:01,124
From head to toe,
you're beautiful all over!

1090
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:03,399
Is that why you leave
me everyday and go?

1091
01:54:03,400 --> 01:54:05,641
Which idiot feels like leaving you?

1092
01:54:05,920 --> 01:54:06,967
But there's work

1093
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,765
No huts! Today you
Won't go anywhere.

1094
01:54:10,040 --> 01:54:12,566
The whole day, you'll he here
at home only, in front of me!

1095
01:54:12,720 --> 01:54:15,530
This can't be possible! The
men are waiting on the farm.

1096
01:54:15,960 --> 01:54:17,883
And the ground is completely ready for sowing.

1097
01:54:18,480 --> 01:54:20,244
If I get late today, then all

1098
01:54:20,440 --> 01:54:21,930
No one gets late in a day.

1099
01:54:22,040 --> 01:54:25,522
Try to understand, Neelam. After
many years it has rained well.

1100
01:54:25,840 --> 01:54:27,251
Its very important to
do the sowing today.

1101
01:54:27,800 --> 01:54:29,131
Those people can do the
sowing, can't they?

1102
01:54:29,200 --> 01:54:32,807
I am a farmer. And I believe in doing
every work with my own hands!

1103
01:54:32,840 --> 01:54:35,320
If you are a farmer, then
I am a farmer's wife.

1104
01:54:35,640 --> 01:54:36,766
I also with come with you.

1105
01:54:36,840 --> 01:54:37,762
What will you do there?

1106
01:54:37,960 --> 01:54:38,802
Whatever you will do.

1107
01:54:40,680 --> 01:54:43,490
These soft hands aren't for
working, but for loving.

1108
01:54:44,240 --> 01:54:44,968
You stay at home.

1109
01:54:46,560 --> 01:54:47,971
Can't you agree to this
small request of mine?

1110
01:54:48,040 --> 01:54:48,609
Don't he arrogant!

1111
01:54:49,120 --> 01:54:50,770
I said that I will return early
in the evening, didn't I?

1112
01:55:08,840 --> 01:55:11,047
Hey you? How did you come here?!

1113
01:55:12,160 --> 01:55:15,528
I am your shadow. Wherever you
Are, I will he there.

1114
01:55:18,080 --> 01:55:19,286
What kind of a dress have you worn?

1115
01:55:20,280 --> 01:55:20,803
A farmer's dress.

1116
01:55:22,120 --> 01:55:25,761
Hey, where are all the men?

1117
01:55:25,960 --> 01:55:27,041
I sent all of them on a holiday.

1118
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:29,488
A holiday! But why?

1119
01:55:29,680 --> 01:55:37,007
'If you work the whole day,
when will you love me?'

1120
01:55:42,440 --> 01:55:50,040
'If you rest at night,
when will you love me?'

1121
01:55:54,920 --> 01:55:58,811
'The whole day you will work.'

1122
01:56:24,120 --> 01:56:30,127
'This weather.. This weather is
for people madly in love.'

1123
01:56:30,440 --> 01:56:34,047
'Of not crying and of reasons!

1124
01:56:43,080 --> 01:56:50,680
'Till when will you keep
killing my desires like this?'

1125
01:56:51,400 --> 01:56:55,405
'Till when will you disturb my sleep?'

1126
01:56:56,080 --> 01:56:58,970
'When will you love me?'

1127
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:29,090
'Write the name of love.'

1128
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:37,162
'From all other names!

1129
01:57:37,880 --> 01:57:45,207
'I don't know when will you
get time from your work?'

1130
01:58:02,240 --> 01:58:06,245
'When will you do this
important work?'

1131
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:09,770
'When will you love me?'

1132
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:21,646
'If you work the whole day,
when will you love me?'

1133
01:58:26,800 --> 01:58:34,207
'If you rest at night,
when will you love me?'

1134
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:18,323
'Eyes!'

1135
01:59:31,440 --> 01:59:33,886
No! This cannot happen!

1136
01:59:35,120 --> 01:59:38,044
Which is this power, that
is protecting Anand?

1137
01:59:38,800 --> 01:59:40,564
From where did Neelam get this power?

1138
01:59:42,800 --> 01:59:44,848
Both of those black snakes.

1139
01:59:46,280 --> 01:59:47,884
Surely they have done something.

1140
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,651
I will have to arrange
something for them!

1141
02:00:05,760 --> 02:00:09,446
This is not a pipe, mother. This
is a boon, granted by you!

1142
02:00:10,440 --> 02:00:13,171
The voice of this pipe can take
anyone into its subjection.

1143
02:00:13,840 --> 02:00:17,890
Its power is like a magnet and can pull
the king of snakes also towards itself.

1144
02:00:19,800 --> 02:00:21,131
Give me power, mother,

1145
02:00:21,840 --> 02:00:27,370
to call those two black snakes and take them
into subjection and find out about the gemstone.

1146
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:29,365
Hail Bhadrakali!

1147
02:01:24,320 --> 02:01:26,561
So my knowledge brought you here!

1148
02:01:27,560 --> 02:01:29,927
Now you must have got an idea
of my power, isn't it?

1149
02:01:31,120 --> 02:01:32,610
Where is your partner?

1150
02:01:34,480 --> 02:01:37,609
Must be protecting the gemstone!

1151
02:01:38,160 --> 02:01:41,403
Now your good is in obeying my order

1152
02:01:42,120 --> 02:01:43,451
and taking me to that gemstone.

1153
02:01:45,560 --> 02:01:47,722
Do you think I am weak like
saint Bhairav Nath.

1154
02:01:47,960 --> 02:01:49,450
Whose life you both had taken?

1155
02:01:50,160 --> 02:01:51,161
I am Gorakhnath.

1156
02:01:51,880 --> 02:01:53,803
The saint with the greatest
accomplishment, Gorakhnath.

1157
02:01:55,120 --> 02:01:56,690
Where are you going snake god?

1158
02:01:58,960 --> 02:02:00,485
Without telling me the
location of the gemstone.

1159
02:02:00,720 --> 02:02:01,881
You cannot go from here!

1160
02:02:33,160 --> 02:02:37,324
You can go out of this boundary only when
you will tell me the location of the gemstone.

1161
02:02:37,920 --> 02:02:39,809
Otherwise, you will get destroyed
within this boundary itself!

1162
02:02:48,680 --> 02:02:50,444
Nothing is lost as yet, snake god.

1163
02:02:51,360 --> 02:02:53,886
By telling me the location of
the gemstone, save your life!

1164
02:02:55,480 --> 02:02:56,766
Take me to the gemstone!

1165
02:02:57,320 --> 02:02:59,766
Otherwise, I will give you that punishment.
that the entire snake community

1166
02:02:59,800 --> 02:03:02,326
will start shivering on hearing
the name of saint Gorakhnath!

1167
02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:05,526
You will not agree this way!

1168
02:03:07,600 --> 02:03:09,443
I have a solution for you!

1169
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:27,930
Ask this worm where is the gemstone!

1170
02:03:51,880 --> 02:03:53,211
Daughter-in-law, where
are you going?

1171
02:03:53,640 --> 02:03:55,130
Hey, daughter-in-law!
Listen to me at least!

1172
02:03:57,040 --> 02:03:59,042
Hey! What has happened
to daughter-in-law?

1173
02:04:00,320 --> 02:04:01,446
Hit this worm!

1174
02:04:04,120 --> 02:04:05,849
Hit him and ask him
where is the gemstone!

1175
02:04:17,240 --> 02:04:21,165
Come ! You just got some magic power once

1176
02:04:21,800 --> 02:04:23,643
and you were successful in setting Anand free!

1177
02:04:24,240 --> 02:04:26,641
And you thought that you have
defeated Gorakhnath?

1178
02:04:28,160 --> 02:04:30,925
But I don't believe in this
magic and black magic.

1179
02:04:31,240 --> 02:04:34,562
I am a sorcerer. The greatest
sorcerer of the universe.

1180
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,241
And you have come
here with my power.

1181
02:04:38,800 --> 02:04:41,007
Maybe I wouldn't have
troubled you to come here

1182
02:04:41,760 --> 02:04:45,207
if these two snakes of yours had
told me the location of the gemstone.

1183
02:04:48,240 --> 02:04:52,609
Why are you sacrificing the lives of these
speechless animals for your selfishness, Gorakhnath?

1184
02:04:53,440 --> 02:04:58,480
The work of learned saints like you .is to
protect living beings, and not taking their lives!

1185
02:04:59,200 --> 02:05:00,042
Stop this fight!

1186
02:05:00,200 --> 02:05:03,363
If this snake tells me the location of
the gemstone then this fight will stop now.

1187
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:08,289
And if they are unable to say anything
you tell me where the gemstone is!

1188
02:05:08,600 --> 02:05:11,046
And if you become arrogant,then
you too. will he in the same condition!

1189
02:05:11,200 --> 02:05:14,921
And after you, your husband, Anand
also will have to face my power!

1190
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,287
This isn't a mongoose, girl. This is power.

1191
02:05:17,440 --> 02:05:19,807
The inner power of a bachelor saint!

1192
02:05:21,960 --> 02:05:26,727
Maybe you aren't aware of the power of
a woman of a faithful wife, Gorakhnath!

1193
02:05:27,240 --> 02:05:31,609
This is that power which can destroy
a thousand cheaters like you!

1194
02:05:32,160 --> 02:05:33,082
Stop this fight!

1195
02:05:33,280 --> 02:05:36,011
The fight will start now, girl!
This is nothing.

1196
02:05:36,600 --> 02:05:38,250
I will bring your
Anand to the same state!

1197
02:05:59,200 --> 02:06:01,168
'Eyes!'

1198
02:06:29,680 --> 02:06:30,203
Blood!

1199
02:06:49,120 --> 02:06:50,565
'Eyes!'

1200
02:07:03,600 --> 02:07:07,047
This isn't your power, girl.
it's the magic of that gemstone.

1201
02:07:08,200 --> 02:07:10,680
But don't think that saint Gorakhnath.
has become helpless!

1202
02:07:11,440 --> 02:07:13,169
I will also turn you into a snake!

1203
02:07:13,680 --> 02:07:15,091
Just like I had put your husband.

1204
02:07:15,600 --> 02:07:18,444
And then you will tell me
the location of the gemstone.

1205
02:07:19,120 --> 02:07:20,804
Forget the attachment
to the gemstone, Gorakhnath.

1206
02:07:21,840 --> 02:07:24,207
And use your power for
the good of humanity.

1207
02:07:24,920 --> 02:07:29,130
Otherwise, you will also he in the same state.
in which your master, Bhairav Nath was!

1208
02:07:30,800 --> 02:07:31,164
Come!

1209
02:08:48,160 --> 02:08:51,846
Saw that? The consequence of
challenging my accomplishments!

1210
02:08:52,680 --> 02:08:54,603
You felt very proud
of your powers!

1211
02:08:55,640 --> 02:08:58,962
Now let's see what you
and your two snakes do!

1212
02:09:32,320 --> 02:09:36,723
'You played the
same game again today.'

1213
02:09:37,160 --> 02:09:41,324
'First it was the master and
now the disciple has come!'

1214
02:09:51,320 --> 02:09:55,962
'O mad, innocent hunter!
If you love your life..'

1215
02:09:56,200 --> 02:10:00,683

1216
02:10:01,280 --> 02:10:04,409
'I am a snake, you
the snake charmer.'

1217
02:10:37,440 --> 02:10:42,082
'Did you forget that old era?'

1218
02:10:52,280 --> 02:10:56,444
'I am an old song of the snake!

1219
02:10:56,680 --> 02:10:58,921
'One will win, one will lose.'

1220
02:10:59,120 --> 02:11:01,407
'Let us see, who will hit whom.'

1221
02:11:01,480 --> 02:11:06,122
'I am light, you are darkness!

1222
02:11:06,680 --> 02:11:09,923
'I am a snake, you
the snake charmer.'

1223
02:11:51,560 --> 02:11:55,804
'The pain is old,
the injury is old.'

1224
02:11:56,360 --> 02:12:00,570
'This story is of the past!

1225
02:12:10,320 --> 02:12:15,087
'You started it again by playing
the pipe again in my lanes.'

1226
02:12:15,280 --> 02:12:19,888
'Today you have set an abode!

1227
02:12:20,360 --> 02:12:23,489
'I am a snake, you
the snake charmer.'

1228
02:12:29,440 --> 02:12:34,082
'I am your enemy,
you are my enemy.'

1229
02:12:34,600 --> 02:12:37,683
'I am a snake, you
the snake charmer.'

1230
02:14:36,560 --> 02:14:37,322
Open your eyes, Neelam.

1231
02:15:28,240 --> 02:15:29,048
No, Anand!

1232
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:39,968
Don't take the sin of the
murder of this saint. on yourself!

1233
02:15:40,600 --> 02:15:42,807
Grandfather,
you don't know this cheater.

1234
02:15:43,760 --> 02:15:47,162
This bastard, for a gemstone, tried
to play with my life and Neelam's life.

1235
02:15:47,800 --> 02:15:49,165
I will not spare him !

1236
02:15:49,200 --> 02:15:49,689
No!

1237
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:54,925
I know everything. Neelam
has told me everything.

1238
02:15:55,520 --> 02:16:01,562
So today, to end this dangerous game.
I have brought this gemstone with me,

1239
02:16:01,760 --> 02:16:03,205
which was kept in the palace to give it to this saint..

1240
02:16:03,280 --> 02:16:06,523
No, grandfather.Don't give him
this gemstone.He is a mad saint.

1241
02:16:06,960 --> 02:16:08,883
I don't know what will he
do after getting the gemstone!

1242
02:16:08,960 --> 02:16:11,531
No, Anand! This gemstone
has divine power.

1243
02:16:11,760 --> 02:16:13,649
Is not good that it remain
with people like us.

1244
02:16:14,280 --> 02:16:17,090
Gorakhnath, I am ready
to give you this gemstone.

1245
02:16:17,240 --> 02:16:18,002
But on one condition!

1246
02:16:19,040 --> 02:16:24,683
After getting this gemstone, you will go so far away
from here that we never see your face all our lives!

1247
02:16:24,720 --> 02:16:25,323
I agree.

1248
02:16:25,680 --> 02:16:26,283
I will go.

1249
02:16:26,320 --> 02:16:26,969
No grandfather!

1250
02:16:27,760 --> 02:16:29,410
This saint isn't worth
giving the gemstone.

1251
02:16:30,040 --> 02:16:33,123
Once he gets the gemstone then he
will cause destruction in the world.

1252
02:16:33,320 --> 02:16:36,722
Bittoo, whatever becomes a danger for
my children I don't want to keep it with me.

1253
02:16:36,760 --> 02:16:37,409
No, grandfather.

1254
02:16:37,520 --> 02:16:38,601
Take this gemstone and go
away from here.

1255
02:16:38,640 --> 02:16:39,971
Grandfather! Grandfather, at least listen to me.

1256
02:16:41,400 --> 02:16:42,128
I will go!

1257
02:16:42,840 --> 02:16:43,921
I will go away forever.

1258
02:16:44,520 --> 02:16:48,809

I struggled all my life for this.

1259
02:16:55,760 --> 02:17:01,802

of my lifetime is fulfilled.

1260
02:17:03,080 --> 02:17:06,323
I got that power for which
I struggled all my life.

1261
02:17:07,320 --> 02:17:09,209
My grand prayer for
power has succeeded!

1262
02:17:09,840 --> 02:17:11,922
I got the result of
my grand prayer for power!

1263
02:17:12,440 --> 02:17:13,646

1264
02:17:18,960 --> 02:17:23,921
Now I will deal with all of you!
All! Now I will not spare anyone.

1265
02:17:24,880 --> 02:17:26,484
Now I will destroy
all of you!

1266
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:30,487
You will get destroyed by
this gemstone only! The gemstone!

Mother!

1268
02:18:42,120 --> 02:18:46,205
Look at such sinners! Even the Gods and
goddesses don't accept them after they die!

1269
02:18:50,600 --> 02:18:51,965
Hey! Where did the gemstone go?

1270
02:18:58,840 --> 02:19:02,765
The gemstone is going to its
location, grandfather. See that.

1271
02:19:07,880 --> 02:19:11,248

both of you have got a new life.

1272
02:19:11,800 --> 02:19:12,687
