1
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,736
Accountant, look, daddy's
plane! Daddy has arrived!

2
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:36,034
Daddy has arrived!

3
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,567
Come, Mr. Richard.

4
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:54,900
Hello, daddy.

5
00:00:54,966 --> 00:00:57,902
Hello, Vicky.. Mr. Saxena.. make
them sit in the car. - Please come.

6
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,869
l suppose everything is fine?
- Yes, everything is fine.

7
00:01:01,066 --> 00:01:04,469
But l want to speak
to you, about Vicky.

8
00:01:04,633 --> 00:01:09,537
Speak to me tomorrow. l am taking
Mr. Richard to the new steel plant.

9
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:24,435
Did you see? Daddy didn't show
any affection towards me today too!

10
00:01:25,433 --> 00:01:29,503
Dear, your daddy is too
engrossed in his work.

11
00:01:31,866 --> 00:01:34,435
But l am here to be
affectionate towards you. Come on..

12
00:01:34,866 --> 00:01:38,135
What is this l hear? Vicky
has started drinking liquor?

13
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:41,568
l had given him in your custody.
And you made him a drunkard?

14
00:01:41,633 --> 00:01:46,637
You are responsible for it.
- l am responsible? What nonsense!

15
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,837
Yes, Mr. Rai sir. You are the
one who has made him an alcoholic.

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,535
You were so busy amassing wealth.

17
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,869
And the poor little Vicky
was thirsting for your love.

18
00:01:58,033 --> 00:02:02,370
You didn't even have time
to meet your dying wife.

19
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:04,701
l still remember the night..

20
00:02:05,366 --> 00:02:07,401
..when you were sending
doctors one after another.

21
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:14,506
Please ask the doctor to
go out for a few minutes.

22
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,401
Please go outside, doctor.

23
00:02:21,033 --> 00:02:23,802
l am on the verge of dying.

24
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:29,536
l am handing over my
Vicky in your care.

25
00:02:31,866 --> 00:02:35,502
Please bring him up
like a mother would.

26
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,701
Because l know..

27
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,570
..that he cannot get his
father's love from his father.

28
00:02:48,366 --> 00:02:53,370
A person who cannot come
to see his dying wife..

29
00:02:53,433 --> 00:02:56,936
..how can he take care of his son?

30
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,800
l am..

31
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,868
..handing over Vicky..

32
00:03:06,566 --> 00:03:08,801
. . in you r. .

33
00:03:12,633 --> 00:03:15,635
. . in you r care .

34
00:03:16,533 --> 00:03:18,701
Madam! Madam!

35
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:22,036
Mr. Rai sir, truth is very bitter.

36
00:03:22,966 --> 00:03:25,301
At an age when children
are unable to digest milk..

37
00:03:25,366 --> 00:03:28,368
..at such an age, you
started serving brandy to Vicky.

38
00:03:28,533 --> 00:03:31,469
When he sneezed, you made him to
drink two teaspoonfuls of brandy.

39
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,402
When he wept, you wanted him to be
served with two teaspoonfuls of brandy.

40
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,903
Only because you didn't want your
business meetings to be disturbed.

41
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,038
Today, the very two teaspoonfuls ha
ve grown into a full bottle.

42
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,805
lt's because of my love
that your son is still alive.

43
00:03:51,433 --> 00:03:57,038
Else, that innocent child would..
- Watch your tongue!

44
00:03:57,766 --> 00:03:59,300
l'm not used to hearing raised voices.

45
00:03:59,966 --> 00:04:02,635
And don't you think that
Vicky cannot live without you.

46
00:04:02,966 --> 00:04:04,534
l can appoint dozens
of servants for him.

47
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:10,237
Why not, sir? Not just dozens, you ca
n appoint hundreds of servants.

48
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,435
Why do you need me now?

49
00:04:13,866 --> 00:04:17,469
l had thought that l wouldn't
Ieave this home till my death.

50
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:22,269
But today, l realize,
that l was wrong.

51
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:26,235
Amarnath Kapoor, of whom
l was the only friend..

52
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,836
..he has gotten lost
in the world of wealth.

53
00:04:30,233 --> 00:04:34,337
Your craving for wealth has made
me a servant from being your friend.

54
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,970
lt was because of my love for
Vicky that l was holding on here.

55
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,304
Today, l will severe all
ties! Nobody can stop me!

56
00:04:44,366 --> 00:04:48,703
No, you cannot leave me. l
cannot live without you.

57
00:04:48,766 --> 00:04:54,471
You have to forget me. You are a
blood-relation to Mr. Rai sir.

58
00:04:54,533 --> 00:04:55,767
He's everything to you.

59
00:04:56,466 --> 00:05:00,803
l am only a servant here.
l will have to go.

60
00:05:00,866 --> 00:05:03,168
Please stop him, daddy. Please stop.

61
00:05:03,233 --> 00:05:08,237
Accountant. Please stop.
You are under oath to me.

62
00:05:14,466 --> 00:05:17,502
Please forgive me. Forgive me.

63
00:05:17,733 --> 00:05:20,235
l too cannot live without you.

64
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,770
Don't weep. l won't go.

65
00:05:25,566 --> 00:05:28,168
Whatever has happened has happened.

66
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:32,168
Vicky won't go to school anymore.
Make arrangements..

67
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,334
..for his education at home itself.

68
00:05:36,466 --> 00:05:37,533
Don't weep, dear.

69
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,902
What's the matter, Mr.
Saxena? You appear very worried?

70
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:43,233
lt's a serious matter.

71
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:45,301
Rai sir had asked for
the colony to be evacuated.

72
00:05:45,566 --> 00:05:47,601
And he ordered to raze the
entire colony with a bulldozer.

73
00:05:48,233 --> 00:05:50,768
But one widow is not
prepared to vacate her hutment.

74
00:05:51,233 --> 00:05:54,769
She says that she will leave
the place only after she is dead.

75
00:05:54,866 --> 00:05:58,536
What can l do about it?
- Give her some money to move out.

76
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,302
l?
- Yes.. only you can do it.

77
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,835
What's the matter?
- Aminabai breathed her last.

78
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,437
O Lord! l had come to ask
her to vacate her hutment.

79
00:06:16,233 --> 00:06:17,434
But she vacated the world itself?

80
00:06:20,633 --> 00:06:24,169
Wake up, mother. Take me to school.

81
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,201
Wake up, mother. Take me to school.

82
00:06:26,433 --> 00:06:27,801
Wake up, mother.

83
00:06:28,366 --> 00:06:29,734
Wake up, mother.

84
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:34,237
Don't weep. l will educate you.
l will take you to school.

85
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,335
What's your name?
- Anwar.

86
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:41,171
Can we take him along with us?
- Yes, dear.

87
00:06:42,633 --> 00:06:46,470
Sir, please keep this
money for her last rites.

88
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:50,302
You will have to promise me
something. - What promise?

89
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:56,305
You will never let Anwar
know who pays for his education.

90
00:06:56,566 --> 00:06:58,601
Alright. l won't.

91
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:03,771
And you won't reveal it to daddy!
- l won't, dear. l won't, dear.

92
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:06,168
Greetings.
- Bravo, Anwar!

93
00:07:07,066 --> 00:07:10,035
What can make a teacher more joyous..

94
00:07:10,066 --> 00:07:14,103
..that his student grows up
to become a decent citizen.

95
00:07:15,366 --> 00:07:17,034
Looking at you today..

96
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,570
..l feel as if my desires
and hopes have been realised.

97
00:07:21,133 --> 00:07:26,505
After the Almighty, it's
you l respect the most.

98
00:07:27,633 --> 00:07:31,036
But a question which you
have been always evading..

99
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,168
..give me the answer today.

100
00:07:34,566 --> 00:07:36,034
Who is that noble person..

101
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:40,037
..who nourished this weak
sapling with his goodness..

102
00:07:40,066 --> 00:07:43,335
..and made it reach this destination?
- Son..

103
00:07:45,066 --> 00:07:47,668
l am bound by a
promise made to someone.

104
00:07:48,366 --> 00:07:51,535
l haven't broken the
promise all my life.

105
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:54,201
Why do you want to make
me guilty of breaking it?

106
00:07:55,233 --> 00:07:57,635
And you see.. it's a small world.

107
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,971
lt's possible that you
might meet that noble person..

108
00:08:03,033 --> 00:08:04,434
..at some point of time.

109
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:13,401
Hey, you drunkard! You alcoholic!

110
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:15,301
The father keeps on minting money.

111
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,268
And the son roams around the streets!

112
00:08:18,266 --> 00:08:21,035
But the boy has a heart of gold!

113
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:26,202
Hey! He's reversing
the car. He might hit us!

114
00:08:49,266 --> 00:08:51,001
Who called me a drunkard?
- l didn't.

115
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:55,434
Who called me an alcoholic?

116
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,233
Not me, sir. No..

117
00:08:59,299 --> 00:09:01,468
l am eating betel-leaf.
l couldn't have spoken!

118
00:09:01,966 --> 00:09:05,502
Where did l say that?
- Mr. Vicky, fire can drink water.

119
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,535
But you can never drink alcohol!

120
00:09:13,566 --> 00:09:17,102
lf not an alcoholic, would you
address an alcoholic as a priest?

121
00:09:17,633 --> 00:09:19,601
Hey! This sounds like poetry!

122
00:09:20,533 --> 00:09:24,203
lf not an alcoholic, would you
address an alcoholic as a priest?

123
00:09:24,933 --> 00:09:27,435
lf not as wheat, would you
describe wheat as sorghum?

124
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,469
What are you doing here?
- We are waiting for the bus.

125
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:37,168
lf the bus doesn't arrive,
Pascal's bar would get closed by then.

126
00:09:38,433 --> 00:09:43,337
Why do you ruin your
intestines by going to bars?

127
00:09:43,966 --> 00:09:47,469
You burn under the sun in the day,
at night Pascal's liquor burns you.

128
00:09:48,433 --> 00:09:50,635
See.. one more poetry has been formed!

129
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:52,934
You should keep meeting me regularly.

130
00:09:53,033 --> 00:09:55,034
l am churning out poetry so easily!

131
00:09:55,533 --> 00:09:57,902
l wonder where Accountant is.

132
00:09:57,933 --> 00:10:01,569
Otherwise, l would have showed
him how one adds weight to poetry.

133
00:10:02,033 --> 00:10:05,636
Come, l will treat you
to English liquor today.

134
00:10:06,466 --> 00:10:10,903
l agree that the English
makes a fool of the world..

135
00:10:10,966 --> 00:10:13,301
..but forgive me, friends..

136
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:18,569
Liquor!
- Wow! How wonderful!

137
00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:22,034
Cheers.. Cheers..

138
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:29,905
''When friends meet up,
it's rendezvous time.''

139
00:11:29,966 --> 00:11:35,071
''When friends meet up,
it's rendezvous time.''

140
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,467
''When friends meet up..''

141
00:11:37,233 --> 00:11:40,469
''The gathering gets colourful..''

142
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:44,836
''The gathering gets colourful,
there's fun to be had..

143
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:47,135
..and your eyes behold new miracles.''

144
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:52,304
''When friends meet up,
it's rendezvous time.''

145
00:11:52,366 --> 00:11:54,434
''When friends meet up,
it's rendezvous time.''

146
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,806
1 o'clock in my house. There
was a cat, there was a mouse..

147
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,369
''They were playing a game
of the carrot and stick.''

148
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:19,035
''The mouse ran ahead,
with the cat at its heel.''

149
00:12:19,933 --> 00:12:22,935
''The mouse ran for its life.''

150
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:26,502
''Help me someone, it said.''

151
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:31,137
''The mouse was running,
the cat was chasing it.''

152
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,768
''The mouse was running
the cat was chasing it.''

153
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:35,402
''The mouse was running
the cat was chasing it..''

154
00:12:36,866 --> 00:12:39,868
''The doors and windows were all shut.''

155
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,402
''He was in bad shape.''

156
00:12:44,266 --> 00:12:47,135
''There l was, with a full glass..''

157
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,103
''The mouse gulped
down all the whisky.''

158
00:12:51,933 --> 00:12:54,935
''And he said.. where's the cat?''

159
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,502
''The cat ran for its life!''

160
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,269
''Luck had smiled on the mouse.''

161
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:04,801
''The cat ran for its life!''

162
00:13:04,866 --> 00:13:06,734
''Luck had smiled on the mouse.''

163
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:11,237
''The cat ran for its life!
Luck had smiled on the mouse.''

164
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:14,335
''The game was risky..''

165
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,734
''The game was risky..

166
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:19,269
..and whisky saved the day.''

167
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:21,134
''And whisky saved the day.''

168
00:13:21,366 --> 00:13:28,206
''The gathering gets colourful,
there's fun to be had..''

169
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:31,168
''And your eyes behold new miracles.''

170
00:13:31,233 --> 00:13:32,701
''When friends meet up..''

171
00:13:32,966 --> 00:13:36,235
''When friends meet up,
it's rendezvous time.''

172
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,268
''When friends meet up..''

173
00:14:03,366 --> 00:14:06,635
''There was this husband,
and there was his wife..

174
00:14:07,266 --> 00:14:10,035
..miserable was their life.''

175
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:14,236
''Drunkard husband, a fighter wife.''

176
00:14:16,233 --> 00:14:19,135
''The wife got angry, the
husband was arrogant.''

177
00:14:19,966 --> 00:14:22,835
''They fought and quarreled every day.''

178
00:14:23,633 --> 00:14:26,635
''Fights and quarrels.''

179
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,634
''Fights and quarrels.''

180
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,335
''Fights and quarrels..''

181
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,369
''The wife had a friend..''

182
00:14:36,266 --> 00:14:39,168
''She gave her a piece of advice.''

183
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,836
''And the wife got to know.''

184
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:47,637
''When the husband
returned drunk that night..

185
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,636
..and knocked on the door..

186
00:14:54,766 --> 00:14:57,635
..the wife played naive and sweet..''

187
00:14:58,633 --> 00:15:01,235
''She opened the door
and said with a smile..''

188
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,635
''My love, come in.''

189
00:15:05,633 --> 00:15:08,268
''Have something to eat first.''

190
00:15:09,266 --> 00:15:12,202
''We'll talk in bed later.''

191
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:15,969
''Lovely nights we'll spend together.''

192
00:15:16,766 --> 00:15:21,670
''The husband was shocked.
Whose house have l landed in?''

193
00:15:22,566 --> 00:15:26,970
''My wife can never
give me so much of love!''

194
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:31,569
''The husband ran away from the bed..

195
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,102
..he fled for his life.''

196
00:15:34,899 --> 00:15:36,568
''The husband ran away from the bed..

197
00:15:36,633 --> 00:15:38,568
..he fled for his life.''

198
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:41,202
''He fled.''

199
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,802
''Lady, he said, forgive me..

200
00:15:45,566 --> 00:15:48,101
..please do justice with me.''

201
00:15:49,133 --> 00:15:52,002
''l've got to go home..

202
00:15:52,966 --> 00:15:55,802
..else my wife will beat me up again.''

203
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:59,735
''Realization then dawned on the wife..

204
00:16:00,233 --> 00:16:03,202
..all the fights then ended.''

205
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,036
''Hatred was vanquished. Love reigned.''

206
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,702
''Their happiness was restored.''

207
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,101
''Hatred was vanquished. Love reigned.''

208
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:14,901
''Their happiness was restored.''

209
00:16:14,966 --> 00:16:17,568
''Restored.''

210
00:16:18,233 --> 00:16:20,768
''He gave up drinking..''

211
00:16:21,933 --> 00:16:23,501
''He gave up drinking..''

212
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:25,567
''Such was the love his wife gave him.''

213
00:16:25,633 --> 00:16:27,568
''They were then lost in love..''

214
00:16:27,733 --> 00:16:30,902
''They met each other..''

215
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:35,504
''The one high that puts to shade..

216
00:16:35,533 --> 00:16:37,501
..every other intoxication..''

217
00:16:37,533 --> 00:16:39,568
''When friends meet up..''

218
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,102
l have nothing against
those in police uniform.

219
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:57,002
We are meeting like this,
l hope everything is fine.

220
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:01,971
Tell me, inspector, how come
we always meet at this turning?

221
00:17:02,633 --> 00:17:04,868
Mr. Vicky, l don't know why..

222
00:17:05,866 --> 00:17:09,736
Whenever l pass through this road,
my feet stop here automatically.

223
00:17:10,533 --> 00:17:14,436
lt seems as if it carries
some noble person's shadow..

224
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,735
..which forces me to stop.

225
00:17:18,066 --> 00:17:20,168
And then often l happen to meet you.

226
00:17:20,966 --> 00:17:24,736
God knows how we are
related to each other.

227
00:17:25,633 --> 00:17:31,171
Tell me, at this late hour,
with these ruffians?

228
00:17:31,433 --> 00:17:33,535
No, they aren't ruffians.
They are my companions.

229
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,567
Companions?
- Yes.

230
00:17:35,933 --> 00:17:37,868
Since they are giving me company,
they are my companions, aren't they?

231
00:17:39,766 --> 00:17:40,867
Shall l ask you something?

232
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:44,935
You have such a palatial,
fortress-like mansion.

233
00:17:45,633 --> 00:17:48,502
And you are to be seen
with these people, here?

234
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,768
That's the reason why l am like this.

235
00:17:52,966 --> 00:17:55,968
Because one fights battles in a
fortress. One doesn't live in it.

236
00:17:57,766 --> 00:17:58,766
See you, inspector.

237
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,834
To save your child's life, he
will have to be operated upon.

238
00:18:01,366 --> 00:18:05,536
You will need money. If you
don't have money, then l'm helpless.

239
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:09,103
No, don't do that, doctor. For G
od's sake, have mercy on us.

240
00:18:09,566 --> 00:18:13,403
Save our child. We
have only one child.

241
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:16,369
God forbid, if
something happens to him..

242
00:18:16,566 --> 00:18:19,368
l will burn down this hospital.

243
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,869
l will eliminate all the doctors.

244
00:18:21,933 --> 00:18:23,801
l am helpless.
- O worshipper of wealth!

245
00:18:24,099 --> 00:18:26,435
How dare you ask for money?
First save my child.

246
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,567
Didn't l say that l am helpless?

247
00:18:27,633 --> 00:18:31,670
Doctor, please don't
take him seriously.

248
00:18:32,433 --> 00:18:33,967
He has been blinded because
of his love for his child.

249
00:18:34,366 --> 00:18:35,700
Please, doctor.
- Greedy for money.

250
00:18:36,099 --> 00:18:37,534
l am helpless.

251
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:40,367
What's the matter, madam?

252
00:18:40,433 --> 00:18:42,635
l don't know what's
happened to our son.

253
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,701
The doctor says that he
will have to be operated upon.

254
00:18:45,466 --> 00:18:49,570
Sir, he's our only son.
He is our only support.

255
00:18:50,466 --> 00:18:53,368
We cannot live without him.

256
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,103
The doctor says that a lot of
money is needed for his operation.

257
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,702
l am only a butcher by profession.
From where do l bring so much money?

258
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:06,004
How much money will you need,
doctor? A lakh, two lakhs, ten lakhs?

259
00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:10,803
Tell me the cost. The child must
not lose his life because of money.

260
00:19:11,566 --> 00:19:15,670
This is my card. You may
send your bill to my office.

261
00:19:16,299 --> 00:19:18,435
He's talking in lakhs for the
sake of an ordinary butcher?

262
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:24,604
This wealthy man can be very handy.
We should entangle him in our net.

263
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,767
Right.

264
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:31,402
Why does morning come so soon?

265
00:19:32,033 --> 00:19:33,300
Wake up, dear.

266
00:19:37,033 --> 00:19:38,734
Madan Singh.
- Good morning, sir.

267
00:19:39,033 --> 00:19:40,300
Make a drink for me.

268
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,868
We have bagged the contract?
Thank you.

269
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:45,367
Mr. Saxena.
- Yes, sir.

270
00:19:45,433 --> 00:19:49,370
Go to Parkar and Parkar. We have
got a contract worth 30 crore rupees.

271
00:19:49,566 --> 00:19:51,301
Fetch the documents from them.
- Ok sir.

272
00:19:52,533 --> 00:19:56,503
Has Vicky woken up?
- l saw Accountant going to his room.

273
00:19:56,933 --> 00:20:00,970
Hello, yes. l am reaching in 10
minutes. l'll be there in a minute.

274
00:20:03,633 --> 00:20:04,700
Sir, tea.

275
00:20:04,766 --> 00:20:08,302
How many times have l told you
that when bottles are emptied..

276
00:20:08,366 --> 00:20:09,667
..they should be disposed of?

277
00:20:12,933 --> 00:20:14,000
Good morning, Vicky.

278
00:20:17,733 --> 00:20:18,800
Good morning, daddy.

279
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,603
Perhaps you don't know that even
empty bottles have some value.

280
00:20:23,966 --> 00:20:27,302
And yes, there's an important
business meeting on the 11th.

281
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:28,400
Reach on time.

282
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:38,570
Did you see, Accountant? A
businessman should be like daddy.

283
00:20:39,633 --> 00:20:42,302
He realizes the value
of an empty bottle..

284
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:46,036
..but he has no realization
of the empty life of his son.

285
00:20:47,299 --> 00:20:50,302
Business.. business..
business.. Round the clock..

286
00:20:50,366 --> 00:20:51,734
Enough of it, dear.

287
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,638
Wow! Wow!
- Once more, once more! Yes, why not?

288
00:20:59,366 --> 00:21:01,534
lt goes like this..

289
00:21:03,633 --> 00:21:07,970
Does one know the pain of
the heart from the outside?

290
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:09,567
Wonderful.

291
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:15,571
Does one know the pain of
the heart from the outside?

292
00:21:15,633 --> 00:21:16,767
Wow! How wonderful!

293
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:20,236
Hold on, friend. Let me
complete my recitation.

294
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:22,769
You are in such a hurry!

295
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,567
So..

296
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:30,668
l forgot the couplet..
What was l saying?

297
00:21:31,233 --> 00:21:33,234
The pain of the heart..
- Yes, of course.. the heart..

298
00:21:33,766 --> 00:21:35,367
Yes, heart. Look.

299
00:21:36,466 --> 00:21:41,737
Does one know the pain of
the heart from the outside?

300
00:21:43,433 --> 00:21:48,237
One doesn't know the pain of
the heart from the outside.

301
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:51,469
Wow! How wonderful! Shut up!

302
00:21:51,766 --> 00:21:53,234
Shut up.

303
00:21:53,433 --> 00:21:56,636
How can you praise him?
Idiot flunkeys!

304
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,837
How can you praise his
rotten and worthless couplets?

305
00:22:02,766 --> 00:22:04,567
My couplet is rotten?

306
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:10,204
lt's so rotten that it has
Ianded the poets in a soup!

307
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:14,469
Your couplet had no rhyme, no
thought, no weight, nothing..

308
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,201
You want to become a poet.

309
00:22:16,466 --> 00:22:20,169
You should stop reciting couplets.
It's not your cup of tea.

310
00:22:20,233 --> 00:22:22,568
How can you say that,
Accountant? Now see..

311
00:22:23,433 --> 00:22:28,171
..the foundation of my
life rests on three pillars.

312
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:33,403
Poetry, liquor and you!

313
00:22:34,766 --> 00:22:37,735
lf either of these pillars are
removed, l will be dislocated.

314
00:22:38,266 --> 00:22:42,169
Then speak in rhymes.
Add weight to your couplet.

315
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:46,637
That's the whole problem. From
where should l bring the weight?

316
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:48,367
You see..

317
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,369
When l try to link the lines,
the rhyming becomes weak.

318
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,169
When l loosen the rhyming,
the weight decreases.

319
00:22:57,166 --> 00:23:01,703
Where does one get weight?
- In the shop of heart.

320
00:23:02,633 --> 00:23:04,835
What?
- l n the shop of heart!

321
00:23:05,733 --> 00:23:08,235
Where's that?
- In the market of love.

322
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:11,735
ln the city of romance,
and in the world of love.

323
00:23:13,233 --> 00:23:16,402
Whatever you are saying,
it's going over my head.

324
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,103
Please speak on my level.
What exactly do you mean to say?

325
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:25,104
Look son, behind every
successful man there has been a woman.

326
00:23:25,533 --> 00:23:28,402
Shahjahan's fame had a
major contribution from Mumtaz.

327
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,503
ln Jehangir's justice,
Noorjehan's love played a major role.

328
00:23:33,133 --> 00:23:36,102
lf you want to add
weight to your couplets..

329
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:40,103
..it's very necessary that
there's a female in your life.

330
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:43,369
lt's a shame,
Accountant! l don't like females.

331
00:23:43,433 --> 00:23:45,535
l don't want to indulge in females.

332
00:23:47,233 --> 00:23:51,103
Moreover, ever since from
my childhood to my youth..

333
00:23:51,133 --> 00:23:55,103
..and from your
youth to your old age..

334
00:23:55,166 --> 00:24:00,170
..l never saw any woman in your life.

335
00:24:01,099 --> 00:24:03,535
Then how did your
couplets become so weighty?

336
00:24:05,433 --> 00:24:08,569
ls it that after
making me go to sleep, you..

337
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:11,701
Gosh! Gosh!

338
00:24:16,633 --> 00:24:17,700

lf you grace the
show as a chief guest..

345
00:24:33,099 --> 00:24:36,036
..the occasion will lit
up as if by four moons.

346
00:24:37,099 --> 00:24:39,035
Why do you want me to get beaten?

347
00:24:39,099 --> 00:24:40,468
There is only one moon.

348
00:24:40,533 --> 00:24:42,701
Where from will you bring
the remaining three moons?

349
00:24:44,033 --> 00:24:48,570
Anyway, how are you
related to this Miss Meena?

350
00:24:49,099 --> 00:24:51,669

- Affairs?

351
00:24:52,233 --> 00:24:55,035

her shows. Organizer.

00:24:55,433 --> 00:24:58,702
And here are some pictures of
Miss Meena. Have a look, please.

353
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,969
Alright, Accountant. If
you insist, l will attend.

354
00:25:29,166 --> 00:25:31,668
Where did l insist?
- If you haven't, please tell him.

355
00:25:32,033 --> 00:25:35,169
Who am l to tell him?
It depends on his will.

356
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:40,004
Alright, l will come.
But on one condition.

357
00:25:40,133 --> 00:25:44,036
Yes, please tell me.
- l will convey it to Accountant.

358
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,967
Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

359
00:25:46,466 --> 00:25:48,534
Excuse me..
- Yes?

360
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,601
You may go.
- Thank you, sir.

361
00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:19,203
What kind of a joke is this,
Mr. Vicky? - Joke? What joke?

362
00:26:19,633 --> 00:26:23,036
l am only sitting here quietly.
There's nobody around me.

363
00:26:23,099 --> 00:26:25,435
Then with whom will l joke?
- That's what l am asking.

364
00:26:25,633 --> 00:26:27,634
Where's the public?
Why is the hall empty?

365
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,936
Why is the hall empty?

366
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:33,902
Your Mr. Natwar Shah had come to me.

367
00:26:33,933 --> 00:26:37,503
He said that an artiste like
you needs to be encouraged.

368
00:26:37,533 --> 00:26:40,102
So l thought why should he
go around selling tickets?

369
00:26:40,566 --> 00:26:43,535
l bought all the tickets.
- That's very kind of you.

370
00:26:44,099 --> 00:26:45,901
Perhaps you don't know that..

371
00:26:45,966 --> 00:26:48,068
..an artiste hankers only
for praises, not for money.

372
00:26:48,966 --> 00:26:53,070
The applause and the praises
wipe away the pains of the heart.

373
00:26:53,233 --> 00:26:56,636
How wonderful! You have
made a very deep statement.

374
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:00,436
l had never delved so deep. l
used to swim only on the surface.

375
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:03,834
One who doesn't
understand a thing in depth..

376
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,968
..how can he understand
the art of an artiste?

377
00:27:06,466 --> 00:27:10,336
lf this is what you wanted to do,
you could've visited some courtesan.

378
00:27:11,133 --> 00:27:15,537
Why did you have to come here?
- A courtesan? That place?

379
00:27:16,833 --> 00:27:19,101
You mean l look like someone
who frequents a courtesan?

380
00:27:20,466 --> 00:27:25,370
l had come to encourage you.
But you have insulted me.

381
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,567
Lady..

382
00:27:28,233 --> 00:27:31,836
l don't know what a
courtesan is, or that place is.

383
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,901
Neither do l want to know.

384
00:27:34,433 --> 00:27:37,836
You just told me that a person
who doesn't understand an artiste..

385
00:27:37,866 --> 00:27:40,835
..is not a human being. On this,
l would like to say that..

386
00:27:40,866 --> 00:27:45,036
..one who doesn't understand a
human being, is also not an artiste.

387
00:27:46,433 --> 00:27:49,335
l am sorry for having hurt you.

388
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:52,467
Let's go, Accountant.
- Let's go.

389
00:27:52,833 --> 00:27:56,570
What does one say on such an occasion?

390
00:27:57,099 --> 00:28:00,102
We are leaving your
alley after being insulted.

391
00:28:00,166 --> 00:28:02,001
Yes.
- Wait.

392
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:05,000
Yes?

393
00:28:05,766 --> 00:28:06,833
Be seated.

394
00:28:07,766 --> 00:28:11,402
Strange. Sometimes she asks us to
Ieave, sometimes she asks us to come.

395
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,302
Yes?
- What would you like to hear?

396
00:28:15,166 --> 00:28:16,767
- Is there anything left to be heard?

397
00:28:19,099 --> 00:28:22,236
Anyway, since you
insist on making me hear..

398
00:28:23,099 --> 00:28:25,101
l live in the world of dreams.

399
00:28:25,166 --> 00:28:27,468
lf you too have some
dream, let me hear.

400
00:28:28,266 --> 00:28:29,433
Then look what my hand can do.

401
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:33,203
You will hear the echo
of a thousand claps.

402
00:28:33,266 --> 00:28:34,867
l assure you that.

403
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,303
''Every inch of your body..''

404
00:28:46,966 --> 00:28:50,903
''l shall colour..''

405
00:28:51,233 --> 00:28:56,071
''l shall adorn.''

406
00:28:57,133 --> 00:29:04,273
''Every time l make my
dancing-bells chime..

..it shall strum your heartstrings.''

408
00:29:42,366 --> 00:29:47,804
''Buy me an expensive necklace,
O crazy lover of mine.''

409
00:29:51,433 --> 00:29:56,004
''Buy me an expensive necklace,
O crazy lover of mine.''

410
00:30:00,433 --> 00:30:06,705
''A silver pellet for
my hair, earrings..

00:30:06,766 --> 00:30:11,170
..anklets, also buy me bangles.''

00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:15,904
''Buy me an expensive necklace,
O crazy lover of mine.''

413
00:30:16,033 --> 00:30:22,339
''ln return l shall embrace you,

414
00:30:22,433 --> 00:30:26,804
''Buy me a blouse, O

''ln return l shall embrace you,
O crazy lover of mine.''

416
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:38,071
''Buy me an expensive necklace,
O crazy lover of mine.''

417
00:30:50,833 --> 00:30:55,704
''When l move out wearing a
veil studded with stars..

418
00:30:55,766 --> 00:30:58,668
..it should leave people gaping.''

419
00:30:58,833 --> 00:31:01,335
''Adorn me, my love.''

420
00:31:01,733 --> 00:31:06,637
''Deck me up, my love.''

421
00:31:11,233 --> 00:31:14,970
''l'm young and delicate.''

422
00:31:15,266 --> 00:31:18,969
''For you, l have
dressed up to the do.''

423
00:31:19,099 --> 00:31:23,170
''Fetch me the sunshine.''

424
00:31:23,233 --> 00:31:26,369
''Fetch me the sunshine, my love.''

425
00:31:26,966 --> 00:31:33,072
''And l shall kiss you,
O crazy lover of mine.''

426
00:31:33,166 --> 00:31:37,236
''And l shall kiss you,

''And l have spun dreams.. for
several lifetimes to come, my love.''

430
00:32:24,099 --> 00:32:31,807
''Lost in your love.''

431
00:32:33,733 --> 00:32:37,303
''At last l believe..''

432
00:32:37,766 --> 00:32:41,269
''What love is all about.''

''People say l'm a drunkard.''

00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:04,974
''Maybe you think so too.''

446
00:34:05,466 --> 00:34:11,872
''People call me a drunkard.''

447
00:34:17,666 --> 00:34:24,839
''Someone is proud of her beauty,
someone is high on his youth.''

448
00:34:25,933 --> 00:34:33,040
''Someone is high on his obsession.''

449
00:34:34,033 --> 00:34:41,173
''At the sight of someone
intoxication rises on the breath.''

450
00:34:42,099 --> 00:34:49,507
''Even a teetotaler
sometimes gets stoned.''

451
00:34:50,166 --> 00:34:58,107
''Tell me, who is not drunk?''

452
00:34:58,533 --> 00:35:06,474
''Present to me any man
who is in his senses.''

453
00:35:06,699 --> 00:35:13,807
''Everyone is drunk in his own ways.''

454
00:35:14,733 --> 00:35:22,807
''The fresh morn is high on dewdrops.''

455
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:32,674
''The breeze is high on fragrance,
the cloud is high on droplets.''

456
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:42,640
''Some are high on joy,
some are high on grief.''

457
00:35:43,466 --> 00:35:46,368
''lf liquor contained intoxication..

458
00:35:46,433 --> 00:35:50,670
..the bottle would've staggered..''

459
00:35:53,633 --> 00:36:00,639
''And the chalices and
wineglasses would've floundered.''

460
00:36:01,433 --> 00:36:08,540
''lf liquor contained intoxication,
the bottle would've staggered.''

461
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:17,374
''Tell me, who isn't drunk?''

462
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:24,740
''Tell me, who isn't drunk?''

463
00:36:25,566 --> 00:36:32,506
''And they call me a drunkard.''

464
00:36:36,433 --> 00:36:40,336
''Let me drink from your eyes,
O crazy sweetheart of mine.''

465
00:36:40,466 --> 00:36:44,303
''Let me drink from your eyes,
O crazy sweetheart of mine.''

466
00:36:44,366 --> 00:36:50,305
''And l shall hold you in
my breath, my sweetheart.''

467
00:36:50,466 --> 00:36:54,336
''l'll buy you an expensive necklace,
O crazy sweetheart of mine.''

468
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,637
''l'll buy you an expensive necklace,
O crazy sweetheart of mine.''

469
00:38:32,433 --> 00:38:34,835
l have performed my
shows before lakhs of people.

470
00:38:36,633 --> 00:38:38,167
But nobody has praised me so much..

471
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:41,402
..nor will anybody
ever be able to in future.

472
00:38:44,766 --> 00:38:46,367
Why did you laugh?

473
00:38:47,566 --> 00:38:48,667
Laugh?

474
00:38:49,466 --> 00:38:52,836
Where does one witness the crop
of laughs coming up these days?

475
00:38:54,233 --> 00:38:56,168
Only a madman laughs..

476
00:38:56,233 --> 00:38:57,233
..or you who is blessed..

477
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:02,238
..otherwise who smiles upon
been born into this world?

478
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,636
How wonderful!

479
00:39:06,099 --> 00:39:09,336
Didn't l prove to be right?
Hasn't your couplet become weighty?

480
00:39:09,633 --> 00:39:11,101
The more you push the matter further..

481
00:39:11,166 --> 00:39:13,167
..it will become all the more weighty.

482
00:39:13,633 --> 00:39:17,136
Who is he?
- How should l introduce him?

483
00:39:17,233 --> 00:39:19,335
There's so much to praise about him.

484
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:21,334
For name's sake, he is Accountant..

485
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,102
You may assume that he's my father..

486
00:39:24,166 --> 00:39:29,604
..my mother, my teacher,
my everything.

487
00:39:30,099 --> 00:39:34,170
Mr. Vicky, by coming here, you have
added a lot of colour to our show.

488
00:39:34,266 --> 00:39:37,702
Open your arms. It appears as if you
are asking for a vote in elections.

489
00:39:38,666 --> 00:39:42,102
You see.. l am very grateful to you..

490
00:39:42,166 --> 00:39:49,806
..for having invited me here,
and transformed my life.

491
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,202
Transformed your life? How's that?

492
00:39:53,733 --> 00:39:54,800
The thing is..

493
00:39:56,633 --> 00:39:57,734
Why should l tell you?

494
00:39:59,633 --> 00:40:02,369
What say, Miss Meena?
Shall l tell him?

495
00:40:05,433 --> 00:40:12,473
So, Mr. Natwar.. come
to my home tomorrow.

496
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:16,803
There is something important.
- Alright.

497
00:40:18,233 --> 00:40:19,434
Good morning, Ms. Meena.

498
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,536
You? - Hello! - How come you
are here so early in the morning?

499
00:40:22,699 --> 00:40:25,636
Having been pleased with your talent..

500
00:40:25,733 --> 00:40:28,102
Mr. Vicky has sent this gift for you.
- Who's Vicky?

501
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,536
The drunkard who you
were praising last night?

502
00:40:32,466 --> 00:40:33,533
Yes, the same one.

503
00:40:34,166 --> 00:40:35,600
Alright, Miss Meena. l am leaving.

504
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:37,667
Come, Arun.

505
00:40:39,733 --> 00:40:41,634
Miss Meena, the wordings of
your lyrics were priceless.

506
00:40:43,533 --> 00:40:47,103
ln response to that, if you
accept this admirers small gift..

507
00:40:47,166 --> 00:40:48,600
..l will be very happy.

508
00:40:49,266 --> 00:40:51,368
The happiness that l had
surely heard about and which..

509
00:40:51,433 --> 00:40:53,101
l saw yesterday too.

510
00:40:53,166 --> 00:40:56,202
And today, l have desired
to possess that happiness.

511
00:40:56,833 --> 00:41:00,036
l hope that you will
respect my feelings.

512
00:41:00,633 --> 00:41:02,468
Yours.. a drunkard.

513
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:21,336
''Buy me a blouse, O
crazy lover of mine.''

514
00:41:22,699 --> 00:41:23,767
Mr. Vicky!

515
00:41:26,366 --> 00:41:27,433
You?

516
00:41:31,066 --> 00:41:32,167
Please come.

517
00:41:35,166 --> 00:41:36,233
Be seated.

518
00:41:37,699 --> 00:41:38,767
Please sit.

519
00:41:46,233 --> 00:41:49,769
l was seated,
imagining about somebody..

520
00:41:51,033 --> 00:41:54,102
Meanwhile, if someone comes all
of a sudden, what would happen?

521
00:41:56,033 --> 00:41:58,001
You have surprised me by coming here.

522
00:41:59,533 --> 00:42:03,536
And you have surprised me by
offering me such an expensive gift.

523
00:42:04,099 --> 00:42:07,670
You liked it?
- Yes, it's very beautiful.

524
00:42:08,466 --> 00:42:12,703
But l won't be able to take care of
this expensive possession of yours.

525
00:42:13,466 --> 00:42:17,703
Don't insult my gift by
describing it as a possession.

526
00:42:19,033 --> 00:42:24,004
One considers the intention,
not the price of the gift.

527
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,335
l respect your intentions.

528
00:42:27,233 --> 00:42:32,338
But being a poor woman, l
won't be able to bear its burden.

529
00:42:34,233 --> 00:42:38,971
To relieve the burden on
the heart of your admirer..

530
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,468
..you will have to lift this burden.

531
00:42:41,466 --> 00:42:47,471
l have a little desire. If it is
fulfilled, l will be highly obliged.

532
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:49,167
Yes?

533
00:42:49,566 --> 00:42:52,135
13th is considered to
be a very cursed day.

534
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:55,703
But that's the day when l was
made to appear on this earth.

535
00:42:56,466 --> 00:42:58,901
l don't know whether l was
made to appear or thrown in here..

536
00:42:58,966 --> 00:43:02,436
..but it's my birthday on the 13th.

537
00:43:03,033 --> 00:43:08,905
And if you come wearing the
dress gifted to you by me..

538
00:43:08,966 --> 00:43:13,303
..it will be the most
precious gift on my birthday.

539
00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:16,101
Yes, but..

540
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:21,368
There's no scope for buts.

541
00:43:23,099 --> 00:43:28,572
You may assume that you are an
artiste and l am an admirer.

542
00:43:29,633 --> 00:43:31,568
Tell me, you will come. Won't you?

543
00:43:33,233 --> 00:43:38,171
Yes. l don't promise.
But l will surely attempt.

544
00:43:38,466 --> 00:43:40,901
Yes, do make an attempt.

545
00:43:41,433 --> 00:43:46,137
Because promises are often broken,
and attempts succeed.

546
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:53,139
So, on the 13th, l will wait for
that attempt of yours.

547
00:43:55,233 --> 00:43:56,300
Please wait..

548
00:43:56,433 --> 00:43:57,901
Madan Singh.
- Yes, sir.

549
00:43:59,366 --> 00:44:01,000
See off Miss. Meena.
- Yes.

550
00:44:16,833 --> 00:44:19,835
You had better understand that..

551
00:44:19,866 --> 00:44:23,236
..a person becomes helpless
once he gives his heart away.

552
00:44:25,833 --> 00:44:28,268
What do you think,
Accountant? Will she come?

553
00:44:28,566 --> 00:44:29,833
She will surely come.

554
00:44:31,833 --> 00:44:36,437
Miss. Meena, you have taken
control of Mr. Vicky's emotional reins.

555
00:44:37,066 --> 00:44:41,370
And now you can make this
wealthy horse run as you like.

556
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:46,271
Gallop, gallop, gallop..
What do you mean to say?

557
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:50,836
lf you give him one hint..

558
00:44:50,866 --> 00:44:54,135
..Mr. Vicky can shift his
attention from this country to abroad.

559
00:44:55,333 --> 00:44:57,368
Then we will tour the entire world.

560
00:44:57,966 --> 00:45:00,201
Your programme will be
organised in every country.

561
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,768
We will earn millions. Ms Meena..

562
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:07,103
..along with your salary, l will
give you a share in the profits too.

563
00:45:07,433 --> 00:45:14,039
l didn't know that you can
talk such filthy things with me.

564
00:45:14,833 --> 00:45:17,101
l am an artiste. l am not cunning.

565
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:21,170
l can never cheat Mr.
Vicky for your benefit.

566
00:45:21,233 --> 00:45:24,169
l was only thinking
of your own interest.

567
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,769
Abroad there are so
many good doctors..

568
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,770
..who make blind
people regain their sights.

569
00:45:31,366 --> 00:45:34,836
l was thinking about
your father's eye-sight.

570
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:39,337
l don't want my father to regain
his eye-sight by ill-gotten wealth.

571
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,368
Gosh! l am trapped in
between blind people.

572
00:45:41,433 --> 00:45:43,768
The father is eye-blind while
the daughter is blind in her brain.

573
00:45:43,833 --> 00:45:44,900
Shut up!

574
00:45:50,033 --> 00:45:53,970
What's the matter? Why
hasn't everybody gone home yet?

575
00:45:54,033 --> 00:45:55,834
Are they working overtime?
- No, sir.

576
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:59,903
Mr. Vicky is going to come here.
- What have they got to do with him?

577
00:45:59,933 --> 00:46:03,202
We haven't seen him since long, sir.
- He loves us very much.

578
00:46:03,333 --> 00:46:08,137
How can we go without meeting him?
- Okay, but you may meet him later.

579
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:11,903
Send him in, the moment he comes.
The directors are waiting for him.

580
00:46:11,966 --> 00:46:13,033
Okay, sir.

581
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,135
Greetings, Junior boss.
- Greetings, Junior boss.

582
00:46:17,699 --> 00:46:18,767
Greetings, Junior boss.

583
00:46:18,833 --> 00:46:19,900
Greetings, Junior boss.

584
00:46:19,966 --> 00:46:21,033
Greetings, Junior boss..

585
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,301
Greetings, Junior boss..

586
00:46:23,366 --> 00:46:24,433
Greetings, Junior boss..

587
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:27,768
Don't call me a junior boss.

588
00:46:29,366 --> 00:46:31,835
Don't say like this. Otherwise,
the senior boss will become angry.

589
00:46:31,933 --> 00:46:34,001
Mr. Vicky, the senior
boss has called you inside?

590
00:46:34,699 --> 00:46:38,036
The senior boss has called me?
Where did you find the senior boss?

591
00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:40,902
l have been searching for him
since years. l didn't see him anywhere.

592
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,835
What are you saying?
Well, you meet him everyday.

593
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,767
He just came out. He has
called you for the board meeting.

594
00:46:44,833 --> 00:46:46,868
l see.. that senior boss.

595
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:50,102
l was thinking of the Almighty.

596
00:46:51,699 --> 00:46:56,371
Mr. Nathulal is not to
be seen. Where is he?

597
00:46:56,433 --> 00:46:58,902
Sir, l am standing next to you.

598
00:46:58,966 --> 00:47:02,636
Mr. Nathulal.. how many
times have l told you that..

599
00:47:02,699 --> 00:47:07,638
..whenever l come here, you
should be in front of me..

600
00:47:07,666 --> 00:47:10,902
..so that l can see your moustache.

601
00:47:10,966 --> 00:47:13,368
Your moustache is indeed amazing.

602
00:47:14,233 --> 00:47:16,902
A moustache should be
like Mr. Nathulal's..

603
00:47:16,966 --> 00:47:18,033
..or there shouldn't be any moustache.

604
00:47:18,099 --> 00:47:19,634
lt's your greatness.

605
00:47:19,699 --> 00:47:22,836
lt's my greatness? It's
your moustache which is big.

606
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:25,302
Then how can l be big? No!

607
00:47:26,233 --> 00:47:28,902
A person who has a big
moustache is a great person.

608
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:32,770
Look here.. my
ground is clear all over.

609
00:47:33,033 --> 00:47:36,035
l wanted to tell you something, boss.
- Oh come on, friend!

610
00:47:36,633 --> 00:47:39,635
Despite being the owner of
such a wonderful moustache..

611
00:47:39,666 --> 00:47:41,968
..you shouldn't call me a
boss. Tell me, what is it?

612
00:47:42,166 --> 00:47:45,636
Sir, my daughter is
getting married next month.

613
00:47:45,699 --> 00:47:48,235
Wow! That's an enjoyable occasion.

614
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,635
l will surely attend
my sister's wedding..

615
00:47:50,699 --> 00:47:51,767
..and state in public that..

616
00:47:51,833 --> 00:47:54,635
..a moustache should
be like Mr. Nathulal's..

617
00:47:54,699 --> 00:47:58,303
..or there shouldn't be any moustache.

618
00:47:58,566 --> 00:48:01,101
You have three daughters, right?

619
00:48:01,166 --> 00:48:03,868
No, l have five daughters.

620
00:48:04,599 --> 00:48:07,569
l have educated them.
But it's of no use.

621
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:09,568
Whoever comes to
discuss a marriage proposal..

622
00:48:09,633 --> 00:48:12,569
..demands 25 to 30
thousand towards dowry.

623
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:14,568
For the marriage of
my elder daughter..

624
00:48:14,599 --> 00:48:18,003
..l have managed to save
25,OOO with great difficulty.

625
00:48:18,833 --> 00:48:23,571
Elder daughter? What will
happen of my other four sisters?

626
00:48:23,833 --> 00:48:26,101
Whatever is destined will happen.

627
00:48:28,699 --> 00:48:31,202
Whatever is destined will happen.

628
00:48:31,266 --> 00:48:34,035
lt sounds like an incomplete couplet.

629
00:48:34,099 --> 00:48:35,901
Please complete it, Accountant.

630
00:48:37,966 --> 00:48:41,803
What will happen by
knocking at every door?

631
00:48:42,233 --> 00:48:45,803
Whatever is destined will happen.

632
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:49,703
How wonderful, Accountant. You
have recited such a wonderful couplet.

633
00:48:49,766 --> 00:48:51,567
There's a lot of
weight in this couplet.

634
00:48:51,633 --> 00:48:56,738
ln the same breath, l should
reduce Mr. Nathulal's burden.

635
00:48:56,833 --> 00:48:58,668
Listen, Mr. Saxena.
- Yes?

636
00:49:00,166 --> 00:49:04,236
Give Mr. Nathulal
2,50,OOO from my account.

637
00:49:05,033 --> 00:49:07,535
250,OOO?
- Yes, Mr. Saxena.

638
00:49:07,966 --> 00:49:13,071
At the rate of 50,OOO my
five sisters deserve 250,OOO.

639
00:49:13,699 --> 00:49:16,936
Get me my cheque book.
l will sign right away.

640
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,635
Who knows about tomorrow?
l might live or die.

641
00:49:19,733 --> 00:49:22,502
No, sir. Don't say such a thing.

642
00:49:22,533 --> 00:49:24,835
May my entire family's
lifespan be added to your life.

643
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:28,970
Get up, Mr. Nathulal. l
won't talk such things.

644
00:49:29,033 --> 00:49:31,869
But.. Mr. Nathulal.

645
00:49:32,533 --> 00:49:34,501
A moustache should be
like Mr. Nathulal's..

646
00:49:34,566 --> 00:49:38,202
..or there shouldn't be any
moustache. What say, am l not right?

647
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,168
Yes sir.
- Yes sir?

648
00:49:41,833 --> 00:49:44,635
Why is your voice so subdued?

649
00:49:44,699 --> 00:49:46,535
Mr. Lobo.. what is your problem?

650
00:49:47,166 --> 00:49:49,768
Sir, my mother is very serious.

651
00:49:50,599 --> 00:49:53,202
The doctor said that l should get
her operated with a senior doctor.

652
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,601
l have spoken to the senior boss..

653
00:49:55,633 --> 00:49:57,735
Why should you tell the senior boss?

654
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:00,736
Go ahead with the operation.
- How can l, sir?

655
00:50:01,633 --> 00:50:06,137
The doctor demands 20,OOO. Not in
my entire life l can earn that much.

656
00:50:06,199 --> 00:50:10,604
But why did you have to be so sullen?

657
00:50:10,833 --> 00:50:16,205
Go and tell your mother
that her son is still living.

658
00:50:16,566 --> 00:50:19,135
l will get her treated. Mr. Saxena..

659
00:50:19,233 --> 00:50:23,937
Yes.
- Give 40,OOO rupees to Mr. Lobo.

660
00:50:24,133 --> 00:50:27,002
Go and get your
mother treated, Mr. Lobo.

661
00:50:27,099 --> 00:50:34,507
Thank you, sir. - But tell your
mother to pray to the Lord for my sake.

662
00:50:34,566 --> 00:50:36,501
Yes, sir.
- If your mother prays for me..

663
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:41,570
..l will feel like l have
won the world. - Yes, sir.

664
00:50:41,633 --> 00:50:45,503
lf l win the world, l will
stand before the world and say..

665
00:50:45,566 --> 00:50:48,869
Friends, roman countrymen..

666
00:50:51,233 --> 00:50:53,501
A moustache should be
like Mr. Nathulal's..

667
00:50:53,566 --> 00:50:55,234
..or there shouldn't be any moustache.

668
00:50:57,466 --> 00:51:00,535
Mr. Kapoor, this is the limit.
Please call Mr. Vicky.

669
00:51:01,133 --> 00:51:05,904
Mr. Bagaria, we will have to bear
with Mr. Vicky to a certain extent.

670
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,168
Mr. Kapoor is setting
up a liquor factory.

671
00:51:08,533 --> 00:51:11,702
Mr. Vicky is a shareholder,
and he's also the largest buyer.

672
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:16,770
Mr. Vicky will be consuming more
than half the quantity we'll produce.

673
00:51:18,933 --> 00:51:24,138
Yes, l will consume more
than half the quantity..

674
00:51:24,833 --> 00:51:26,067
..because l am a drunkard.

675
00:51:28,566 --> 00:51:30,434
And l drink the liquor
that is manufactured..

676
00:51:30,466 --> 00:51:32,835
..in the factories of
respectable people like you.

677
00:51:34,933 --> 00:51:39,103
But why do you object
to my drinking liquor?

678
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:45,504
What have you come in
today's board meeting for?

679
00:51:46,699 --> 00:51:49,169
To set up a new
liquor factory, isn't it?

680
00:51:50,433 --> 00:51:53,669
Where lakhs of new liquor
bottles will be manufactured..

681
00:51:54,533 --> 00:51:56,635
..thousands of more
drunkards will be created.

682
00:51:57,433 --> 00:52:00,569
Do you realise this?

683
00:52:02,366 --> 00:52:04,501
O yes-men of my father!

684
00:52:05,699 --> 00:52:10,838
l drink liquor but what do you
drink? A human being's blood?

685
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:11,967
Vicky..

686
00:52:16,433 --> 00:52:20,370
You are laughing to see me
shaking under intoxication..

687
00:52:20,433 --> 00:52:29,108
..but have you ever
glimpsed into your own conscience?

688
00:52:30,599 --> 00:52:33,669
lt is more unstable than a
totally intoxicated drunkard.

689
00:52:33,866 --> 00:52:37,970
Vicky, will you keep quiet now.
- Mr. Kapoor what is this..

690
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,369
Have you summoned this
meeting to insult us?

691
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,969
How can anybody
insult you, Mr. Nahata?

692
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,002
Only a person who has
respect can be insulted.

693
00:52:46,366 --> 00:52:50,570
This is too much. - This is the
limit. - We can bear it no longer.

694
00:52:50,633 --> 00:52:52,368
For this project, you
had better choose people..

695
00:52:52,433 --> 00:52:54,935
..who are prepared to
hear your son's abuses.

696
00:52:55,466 --> 00:52:57,768
ln future, if at all, the
meetings will be held in my office.

697
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:00,936
Let's leave. - Yes, let's leave.
- What does he think of himself?

698
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:08,635
Have you unloaded your frustrations?

699
00:53:08,699 --> 00:53:10,301
lf there is anything still left..

700
00:53:10,333 --> 00:53:13,436
..you may pacify your
fury by cursing me too!

701
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,301
These people who
have just walked away..

702
00:53:16,366 --> 00:53:20,036
..they could never ever dare
to speak to me in the face.

703
00:53:20,699 --> 00:53:24,370
And today, because of
you they left the meeting.

704
00:53:24,433 --> 00:53:27,636
Yes, it has truly been a great loss.

705
00:53:28,033 --> 00:53:32,904
They used to fear you. Now they
have raised their heads because of me.

706
00:53:33,699 --> 00:53:38,404
l didn't know that you
Iove people to be submissive.

707
00:53:38,966 --> 00:53:41,301
You just need slaves,
who like a machine..

708
00:53:41,366 --> 00:53:44,302
..start moving when
the button is pressed..

709
00:53:44,333 --> 00:53:48,003
..and stop when the
button is switched off.

710
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:50,301
lf you have to
survive in today's world..

711
00:53:50,366 --> 00:53:54,036
..you have to keep the
buttons in your control.

712
00:53:55,033 --> 00:53:57,535
Otherwise, this world
will not let you survive.

713
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:00,969
Yes, but you are forgetting that..

714
00:54:01,733 --> 00:54:05,236
..above the people
who hold the buttons..

715
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:08,469
..there is Him who
holds the main switch.

716
00:54:09,966 --> 00:54:13,502
Life, luck.. all this..

717
00:54:13,866 --> 00:54:15,968
That's the source of the real current.

718
00:54:17,233 --> 00:54:22,438
lf he switches off the main
switch some day.. what then?

719
00:54:22,633 --> 00:54:26,870
l don't want to argue with you.
You've caused me a heavy loss today.

720
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:31,303
l had called you for an
important business meeting. But you..

721
00:54:31,366 --> 00:54:32,967
Ever since childhood..

722
00:54:34,699 --> 00:54:37,569
..you have only called
me for business meetings.

723
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:40,367
Ever since l started
to understand things..

724
00:54:40,433 --> 00:54:46,572
..l don't remember you calling me
for anything except for business.

725
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:49,567
Did you?

726
00:54:50,366 --> 00:54:52,434
You never started
understanding things.

727
00:54:53,333 --> 00:54:55,234
Ever since you got stuck
to liquor like a label..

728
00:54:55,266 --> 00:54:57,801
..you haven't been able to
separate yourself from it.

729
00:54:58,566 --> 00:55:01,769
What have you done in life,
besides boozing and laughing?

730
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:05,167
lf l have got stuck to
liquor like a label..

731
00:55:05,233 --> 00:55:07,735
..it's you who has stuck me to it.

732
00:55:09,466 --> 00:55:12,168
As for laughing, let
me tell you that..

733
00:55:12,233 --> 00:55:14,835
..l have never laughed in my life.

734
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,168
l have only laughed
Ioudly responding..

735
00:55:18,233 --> 00:55:19,801
..to the hollow laughs of people.

736
00:55:20,599 --> 00:55:23,302
You have only heard the bursts
of laughter from a distance.

737
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:27,370
You have never come closer and
seen the tears stuck in them.

738
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:30,168
Bursts of laughter, tears, emotions..

739
00:55:30,233 --> 00:55:32,835
..these belong to useless people.

740
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,435
l don't have time for such things.

741
00:55:36,766 --> 00:55:38,901
Moreover, what for do you shed tears?

742
00:55:39,366 --> 00:55:42,569
What luxury do you not have?
What have l not provided you?

743
00:55:43,766 --> 00:55:46,168
Yes, daddy, you provided
me everything which can be..

744
00:55:46,233 --> 00:55:49,469
..bought from the market
and decorated at home.

745
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:53,836
But you never gave me the
joys that can adorn a heart.

746
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:56,201
You have started it again.

747
00:55:56,533 --> 00:56:00,136
l have told you several times that l
don't have time for such nonsense.

748
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:01,334
Wait, daddy.

749
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,101
Since we have talked
so much nonsense..

750
00:56:04,166 --> 00:56:05,734
..let there be a little more.

751
00:56:07,366 --> 00:56:11,103
Looking at you, l
remembered the story of the king..

752
00:56:11,166 --> 00:56:15,169
..who had been blessed that all
that he touches will turn to gold.

753
00:56:16,699 --> 00:56:19,102
Once, the king put his hands on hi
s progeny by mistake..

754
00:56:19,166 --> 00:56:21,234
..and it turned to gold.

755
00:56:22,833 --> 00:56:24,100
The king wept a lot,
and regretted it..

756
00:56:24,166 --> 00:56:27,502
..but that statue couldn't
turn into a human being again.

757
00:56:29,833 --> 00:56:31,234
Your story too is similar.

758
00:56:32,533 --> 00:56:35,302
That's why you kept me at a distance.

759
00:56:35,333 --> 00:56:36,467
You never let me come close to you.

760
00:56:38,566 --> 00:56:41,635
You didn't even make the mistake
that was committed by the king.

761
00:56:43,533 --> 00:56:46,402
Neither did you lift me in
your arms, nor embraced me.

762
00:56:48,766 --> 00:56:54,671
Because you feared that if you
touched me, l could turn to gold.

763
00:56:55,833 --> 00:56:57,034
lf l would turn to gold..

764
00:56:57,099 --> 00:57:00,036
..who would sign the
documents of your businesses..

765
00:57:00,099 --> 00:57:04,471
..which you have started in my name?
Who would sign your cheques?

766
00:57:08,166 --> 00:57:13,504
l want to see you once
smiling and laughing.

767
00:57:14,433 --> 00:57:18,770
Come out of your world
of wealth and have a look.

768
00:57:20,033 --> 00:57:22,034
This world of wealth
has submerged in liquor..

769
00:57:22,099 --> 00:57:25,269
..and made me a useless
person and a moving corpse.

770
00:57:33,099 --> 00:57:37,370
You are talking to the walls.
Mr. Kapoor has already left.

771
00:57:39,633 --> 00:57:40,734
Yes, Accountant.

772
00:57:41,133 --> 00:57:43,034
Down with the people who
are demolishing our huts.

773
00:57:43,099 --> 00:57:44,201
Enough of it, dear.

774
00:57:44,266 --> 00:57:46,368
Down with the people who
are demolishing our huts.

775
00:57:46,433 --> 00:57:48,101
Why this noise?

776
00:57:50,266 --> 00:57:53,636
Mr. Vicky..
- Yes, Mr. Saxena. What is it?

777
00:57:54,099 --> 00:57:58,204
These people want to meet you.
- Mr. Vicky, we live in Sewri.

778
00:57:58,633 --> 00:58:00,968
We have received a court notice
sent on your father's behalf..

779
00:58:01,033 --> 00:58:04,636
..that we should vacate
the colony within 48 hours.

780
00:58:04,699 --> 00:58:07,369
Where will we go with our family?

781
00:58:08,633 --> 00:58:10,201
What's all this, Mr. Saxena?

782
00:58:10,966 --> 00:58:14,369
Boss has won this case
with the help of the courts.

783
00:58:15,066 --> 00:58:19,570
But in whose name is this land?
- It's in your name.

784
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,635
Come over there with
the property documents.

785
00:58:25,699 --> 00:58:27,301
l will meet you there.
Come on, Accountant.

786
00:58:31,033 --> 00:58:32,401
See for yourself, Mr. Vicky.

787
00:58:32,466 --> 00:58:35,535
Tell us, where can we
go with our little kids?

788
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:37,501
Here's the file, Mr. Vicky.

789
00:58:42,633 --> 00:58:43,967
Mr. Saxena, within one month..

790
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,970
..all the houses of this
Iocality should be made so strong..

791
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:53,605
..that my father's intentions
cannot weaken their foundations. - Yes.

792
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:01,170
Prepare the documents of this
colony and take my signature. - Okay.

793
00:59:05,966 --> 00:59:07,033
Morning, daddy?

794
00:59:07,133 --> 00:59:09,468
When will you ever
mend your ways, Vicky?

795
00:59:09,966 --> 00:59:12,435
You have ruined my
project worth crores of rupees.

796
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:14,301
You have even burnt
the property papers.

797
00:59:15,066 --> 00:59:18,636
Have you taken the responsibility
of supporting all the poor people?

798
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:23,437
Daddy, why do these
people act like this?

799
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:24,567
l don't understand.

800
00:59:25,233 --> 00:59:26,901
lf the progeny is nice,
intelligent and able..

801
00:59:26,966 --> 00:59:30,436
..then what's the
necessity of accumulating wealth?

802
00:59:31,033 --> 00:59:34,269
And if he is useless, what's
the point in amassing wealth?

803
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:38,303
lf you continue to toss money like
this, there will be a time when..

804
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:39,900
lf one removes a couple of
mugs of water from an ocean..

805
00:59:39,966 --> 00:59:42,635
..does it make any
difference to the ocean?

806
00:59:43,433 --> 00:59:44,901
lf you feel that l am
causing losses to you..

807
00:59:44,966 --> 00:59:48,636
..why don't you disassociate me?
- Vicky..

808
00:59:49,233 --> 00:59:51,902
Whenever l try to
explain things to you..

809
00:59:51,933 --> 00:59:54,201
..you start talking nonsense.

810
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:58,536
Anyway, it's your birthday tomorrow.
Don't forget about it.

811
00:59:59,366 --> 01:00:02,102
Accountant, you too may remind him.

812
01:00:03,966 --> 01:00:09,638
Yes, remind me that a special gue
st will be coming tomorrow.

813
01:00:23,333 --> 01:00:26,335
Happy birthday to you..

814
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,503
Happy birthday to you..

815
01:00:29,566 --> 01:00:36,239
Happy birthday to Vicky..
Happy birthday to you..

816
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:41,034
Many happy returns of the day.

817
01:00:48,099 --> 01:00:51,403
Cut the cake quickly because
some people are waiting for me.

818
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:55,469
Not now.
- Why?

819
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:58,235
Because l am also
waiting for somebody.

820
01:00:58,833 --> 01:00:59,867
Who's that?

821
01:01:01,933 --> 01:01:04,969
You tell daddy whom l am waiting for.

822
01:01:05,033 --> 01:01:08,936
The thing is..
- l understand.

823
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:13,469
You are expecting a special friend.
You may continue enjoying.

824
01:01:14,033 --> 01:01:15,567
l have some work.
- Work?!

825
01:01:18,366 --> 01:01:19,433
Work?

826
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:22,469
Every minute is precious for you.

827
01:01:22,533 --> 01:01:24,234
You must be having
some special meeting.

828
01:01:26,233 --> 01:01:31,071
Dear, what happened? Why are you t
hrowing things around?

829
01:01:31,166 --> 01:01:34,168
There was a necklace
which l am unable to find.

830
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:48,903
Please accept this
small gift from all of us.

831
01:01:48,966 --> 01:01:52,569
Wow! This is what a gift is!

832
01:01:53,833 --> 01:01:56,869
l am surely a drunkard,
but not to this extent.

833
01:01:58,333 --> 01:02:02,170
What's the secret of this moustache?

834
01:02:02,266 --> 01:02:05,802
Sir, you like my moustache, don't you?

835
01:02:06,166 --> 01:02:07,767
That's why to please you..

836
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:12,204
..the entire staff has
grown such moustache.

837
01:02:21,833 --> 01:02:24,335
Mr. Saxena.. you too?

838
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:31,367
Saxena?

839
01:02:33,766 --> 01:02:37,870
Mr. Nathulal, this is a double gift.

840
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:44,373
l will always hold this precious
gift close to my heart all my life.

841
01:02:44,433 --> 01:02:48,904
l will die of thirst,
but l will never drink it.

842
01:02:49,066 --> 01:02:54,371
You liked the gift, didn't you?
- Yes, l liked it very much.

843
01:02:54,766 --> 01:02:57,368
And now you may please stand up.

844
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:04,237
Sir, have l made some mistake?
- Mistake?

845
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,702
When you get up,
people will at least feel..

846
01:03:07,766 --> 01:03:11,035
..that two decent people are
sitting and talking with each other.

847
01:03:11,133 --> 01:03:14,336
Now it seems that l am
standing and you are sitting.

848
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,769
Come on, stand up.
- Yes.

849
01:03:18,166 --> 01:03:21,135
Yes.. now the matter
is of the same level.

850
01:03:21,933 --> 01:03:23,000
Sir..

851
01:03:34,699 --> 01:03:36,001
What's the matter, Mr. Nathulal?

852
01:03:38,033 --> 01:03:39,167
Mr. Nathulal?

853
01:03:40,033 --> 01:03:44,937
Yes, sir?
- Why are you staring at me like this?

854
01:03:45,033 --> 01:03:48,102
Nothing.. just like that.

855
01:03:48,233 --> 01:03:51,169
Hey! Why are you all
standing doing nothing?

856
01:03:51,233 --> 01:03:54,369
Go ahead, eat, drink and
make merry.. and then leave.

857
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:57,869
But sir, please cut the cake first.

858
01:03:58,133 --> 01:04:01,636
lt's my birthday.
Whether l cut the cake or not..

859
01:04:01,699 --> 01:04:05,703
..what difference does it make to
you? You don't have to cut the cake!

860
01:04:05,766 --> 01:04:08,068
Please go ahead. l am
waiting for somebody.

861
01:04:08,133 --> 01:04:11,035
Mr. Natwar, l won't be able to p
articipate in the show today.

862
01:04:12,066 --> 01:04:13,133
Why?

863
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:17,670
l have lost the necklace
which Mr. Vicky had gifted me.

864
01:04:18,833 --> 01:04:21,769
Lost the necklace? But why worry?

865
01:04:21,833 --> 01:04:23,834
Mr. Vicky will buy you a new necklace.

866
01:04:23,966 --> 01:04:25,200
But?
- Nothing.

867
01:04:25,366 --> 01:04:26,633
You know that if you
don't take the stage..

868
01:04:26,699 --> 01:04:30,136
..people will throw shoes at me,
they will break the chairs.

869
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:31,267
Please.

870
01:04:38,166 --> 01:04:41,035
Switch off the lights, Mr. Nathulal.
- As you wish, sir.

871
01:04:59,966 --> 01:05:01,934
All this has happened because of you.

872
01:05:02,033 --> 01:05:03,734
You have caused me embarrassment.

873
01:05:05,733 --> 01:05:08,869
Your rhyming has weakened my poetry.

874
01:05:11,666 --> 01:05:14,568
Till a woman doesn't
enter a man's life..

875
01:05:14,633 --> 01:05:17,736
..his statements
don't have any weight.

876
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:20,135
This is what you said,
didn't you? Now you see?

877
01:05:21,966 --> 01:05:23,000
ln trying to add weight to my..

878
01:05:23,099 --> 01:05:25,168
..statements, l have
Iost my own weight.

879
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,702
You have landed a decent
man like me in a soup.

880
01:05:30,633 --> 01:05:33,635
Have you ever seen me
waiting for somebody before?

881
01:05:34,166 --> 01:05:37,669
Now it looks as if l am waiting
for someone ever since l was born.

882
01:05:39,066 --> 01:05:40,700
This.. this..

883
01:05:41,133 --> 01:05:44,302
lf she doesn't come
before this candle burns out..

884
01:05:44,766 --> 01:05:45,833
..then..

885
01:05:46,933 --> 01:05:51,871
..l will develop a hatred for candles.

886
01:05:52,733 --> 01:05:54,901
She will come. She will surely come.

887
01:05:55,133 --> 01:05:59,837
l feel in the heart that come
what may, she will surely come.

888
01:05:59,900 --> 01:06:03,236
She will come?
Alright, l will believe it.

889
01:06:04,233 --> 01:06:06,101
But shall l tell you something?

890
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,134
She will surely come.

891
01:06:11,633 --> 01:06:15,069
Miss Meena, did you get the
necklace given by Mr. Vicky?

892
01:06:16,166 --> 01:06:19,502
No. This is a fake
necklace made of glass..

893
01:06:19,566 --> 01:06:22,669
..which l wear in your shows.

894
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:25,702
l thought you got the real necklace.

895
01:06:27,933 --> 01:06:29,000
Give it to me.

896
01:07:35,766 --> 01:07:41,538
''There's a lot to one's patience.''

897
01:07:43,966 --> 01:07:49,871
''There's no word from my beloved.''

898
01:07:52,099 --> 01:07:55,736
''But l'm sure..

899
01:07:56,433 --> 01:07:59,636
..she is not unfaithful.''

900
01:08:00,433 --> 01:08:03,369
''What then could be the reason..

901
01:08:03,433 --> 01:08:06,068
..to keep me waiting?''

902
01:08:08,599 --> 01:08:14,505
''There's a limit to how
much she can keep me waiting.''

903
01:08:16,866 --> 01:08:22,504
''There's no word from my beloved.''

904
01:08:25,033 --> 01:08:32,807
''l do have faith, however,
that she's not unfaithful..''

905
01:08:33,433 --> 01:08:36,369
''What then could be the reason..

906
01:08:36,433 --> 01:08:39,502
..to keep me waiting?''

907
01:09:19,333 --> 01:09:24,638
''That which she possesses
nobody here quite does.''

908
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:32,872
''She belongs only to me.
And that's talk of the town.''

909
01:09:35,733 --> 01:09:41,371
''She is with me in every
joy and sorrow of mine.''

910
01:09:43,899 --> 01:09:49,438
''lf she isn't with me,
my life is worth nothing.''

911
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:53,836
''May this flame of faith
never be extinguished.''

912
01:09:53,899 --> 01:09:59,405
''There's a limit to how
much she can keep me waiting.''

913
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:07,838
''There's no word from my beloved.''

914
01:10:10,366 --> 01:10:14,303
''l do have faith, however..

915
01:10:14,366 --> 01:10:17,836
..that she's not unfaithful.''

916
01:10:18,699 --> 01:10:21,302
''What then could be the reason..

917
01:10:21,366 --> 01:10:24,435
..to keep me waiting?''

918
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:34,907
''My love..

919
01:10:35,699 --> 01:10:43,741
..here l am.''

920
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:43,572
''My love..

921
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:50,405
..here l am.''

922
01:12:03,666 --> 01:12:07,169
''They must've given
you priceless gifts..

923
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:09,835
..but l bring you only my heart.''

924
01:12:10,433 --> 01:12:13,769
''l pray that we may never ever part.''

925
01:12:13,833 --> 01:12:16,569
''My heart shall always be yours.''

926
01:12:16,733 --> 01:12:22,305
''My life belongs to you.''

927
01:12:23,233 --> 01:12:28,905
''My life belongs to you.''

928
01:12:30,533 --> 01:12:36,572
''You are the one l dream of..

929
01:12:37,166 --> 01:12:42,838
..and l have you now.''

930
01:12:43,699 --> 01:12:46,602
''My love..

931
01:12:47,166 --> 01:12:50,269
..here l am.''

932
01:12:56,833 --> 01:13:00,102
''Gone is the darkness of gloom,
fading skies come to light..

933
01:13:00,166 --> 01:13:03,269
..and l come to life
now that l see you.''

934
01:13:03,633 --> 01:13:06,102
''There's a song on my lips,
desire in my heart..

935
01:13:06,166 --> 01:13:09,702
..now that you feel shy in my arms.''

936
01:13:09,733 --> 01:13:15,472
''The ecstasy takes over.''

937
01:13:16,399 --> 01:13:22,506
''The ecstasy takes over.''

938
01:14:20,433 --> 01:14:23,202
Today, you have made
my dream come true.

939
01:14:23,566 --> 01:14:26,335
You have shown respect for my gift.

940
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:33,405
l have never felt so
happy all my life.

941
01:14:38,033 --> 01:14:40,101
You look so beautiful.

942
01:14:41,766 --> 01:14:47,204
The same dot, the same mark,
the same red blush..

943
01:14:48,533 --> 01:14:50,368
The same precious
necklace around your neck.

944
01:14:53,066 --> 01:14:54,734
Hey! What's this?

945
01:14:57,300 --> 01:15:01,203
Mr. Vicky, this is a fake necklace.

946
01:15:03,166 --> 01:15:05,368
The necklace given by
you has been stolen.

947
01:15:07,699 --> 01:15:13,172
l wanted to return it to you as
my gift to you on your birthday.

948
01:15:19,033 --> 01:15:22,970
l just don't know how
to joke with anybody.

949
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:28,171
Whoever l joked with, l
ended up hurting that person.

950
01:15:28,966 --> 01:15:32,569
You see.. l gave you a fake necklace..

951
01:15:32,633 --> 01:15:33,700
A fake necklace?

952
01:15:35,033 --> 01:15:38,102
Was it a fake necklace?

953
01:15:38,366 --> 01:15:41,268
Yes, it was fake necklace.
Then what? Was it a real one?

954
01:15:41,566 --> 01:15:46,604
These days one doesn't even
get a real poison in the market.

955
01:15:48,133 --> 01:15:50,969
Moreover, do l have to invite
the income-tax authorities..

956
01:15:51,033 --> 01:15:54,102
..to my home by gifting you
a nine-lakh-rupee necklace?

957
01:15:54,199 --> 01:15:55,301
Not at all!

958
01:15:55,933 --> 01:15:59,102
From today, l am ending all jokes.

959
01:15:59,433 --> 01:16:00,500
Stop that.

960
01:16:01,199 --> 01:16:04,169
This joke of yours made
life miserable for me.

961
01:16:04,566 --> 01:16:05,900
Thinking it to be a real necklace..

962
01:16:05,966 --> 01:16:10,203
..l didn't even go out of
the house nor sleep peacefully.

963
01:16:11,166 --> 01:16:15,370
You've harassed a poor girl,
you've hurt her. Was it a joke?

964
01:16:17,133 --> 01:16:20,402
l will never pardon you for this.

965
01:16:20,466 --> 01:16:23,235
Listen, Meena..

966
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:26,336
What's this?

967
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:28,902
Within no time, you made a
real necklace into a fake one.

968
01:16:28,933 --> 01:16:32,436
l had issued a cheque of 9
Iakhs when l brought this necklace.

969
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:36,303
Accountant, you should take into
account the circumstances too.

970
01:16:36,966 --> 01:16:40,135
Did you see her diamond-shaped eyes?

971
01:16:40,899 --> 01:16:46,572
Each of her eye was shedding
tears worth a lakh of rupees each.

972
01:16:47,366 --> 01:16:50,535
Two tears rolled out of one eye
and then two from the other eye.

973
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:52,301
How many are they? Four!

974
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:57,838
Then two more tears rolled out,
and then two another from the other.

975
01:16:57,899 --> 01:17:00,002
How many are they? Twelve.

976
01:17:00,899 --> 01:17:04,370
At the rate of one lakh each,
she shed tears worth 12 lakhs.

977
01:17:04,833 --> 01:17:10,071
Before she shed any more tears, l
told her that the necklace is fake.

978
01:17:10,133 --> 01:17:15,004
Tears worth 12 lakhs for
a necklace worth 9 lakhs?

979
01:17:15,399 --> 01:17:17,835
lf dad were to know, he
would have scolded me saying..

980
01:17:17,899 --> 01:17:20,902
..that l don't know
how to do business.

981
01:17:21,333 --> 01:17:24,569
You have incurred losses in love too?

982
01:17:26,966 --> 01:17:29,234
Come on, let's go to
the police station.

983
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:31,969
Hold on.. hold on.
- What is the matter?

984
01:17:32,166 --> 01:17:34,201
Hold on, where are you going?

985
01:17:37,066 --> 01:17:38,133
Let's go now.

986
01:17:44,233 --> 01:17:46,168
A necklace worth 9 lakhs?

987
01:17:46,399 --> 01:17:48,435
And you say that it
is a small complaint?

988
01:17:49,566 --> 01:17:54,037
Accountant, why is this
world so crazy about money?

989
01:17:54,566 --> 01:17:58,336
The moment l mentioned 9,OO,OOO,
the Inspector's hands and pen froze.

990
01:17:58,966 --> 01:18:02,936
Mr. Anwar, l don't
care about the price.

991
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:07,971
But l care about the necklace which
l had bought for that valuable neck.

992
01:18:08,366 --> 01:18:12,369
Which is that valuable neck for
which you are becoming so worried?

993
01:18:14,399 --> 01:18:18,036
You may assume that she
is going to be my wife.

994
01:18:18,166 --> 01:18:21,402
And it is your responsibility
now to search for that necklace.

995
01:18:21,466 --> 01:18:23,367
Okay.
- Let's go. - Good night, sir.

996
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:29,170
You? Here? At the police station?

997
01:18:29,866 --> 01:18:33,502
Yes, l have got to know
the truth about the necklace.

998
01:18:34,766 --> 01:18:39,170
But l haven't been able to
know what kind of a thing you are.

999
01:18:39,833 --> 01:18:42,302
Yes, what kind of a person l am..

1000
01:18:43,266 --> 01:18:46,402
Shall l tell her what
kind of a person l am?

1001
01:18:50,766 --> 01:18:51,867
Shall l?

1002
01:18:55,366 --> 01:18:56,433
lnspector..

1003
01:18:58,199 --> 01:18:59,868
My valuable neck!

1004
01:19:01,766 --> 01:19:06,203
l want to make Meena
the pride of my home.

1005
01:19:06,266 --> 01:19:09,369
But she wants to become
a keep of that drunkard.

1006
01:19:09,433 --> 01:19:12,135
What are you saying?
- Yes, l am speaking the truth.

1007
01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:15,235
Meena is very proud of her beauty.

1008
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:19,703
l will pour acid on her
face and make it so horrible..

1009
01:19:19,733 --> 01:19:22,802
..that people won't come
near her even to give her alms.

1010
01:19:22,866 --> 01:19:26,169
Mr. Natwar, you..
- You had better explain it to her.

1011
01:19:26,766 --> 01:19:30,703
Otherwise, the police will
find the corpses of both of you..

1012
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:34,336
..in a condition that they
will not know who is who?

1013
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:39,872
No, no. - Have you spit all
your venom or is there any left?

1014
01:19:39,933 --> 01:19:41,968
What am l hearing?

1015
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:47,438
Father, you recognise
people by their footsteps.

1016
01:19:48,433 --> 01:19:51,235
But you couldn't
recognise your own daughter?

1017
01:19:51,399 --> 01:19:54,035
But what was Mr. Natwar saying about?

1018
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:55,401
Mr. Natwar?!

1019
01:19:56,766 --> 01:19:58,801
l will tell you the
truth about him today.

1020
01:19:59,833 --> 01:20:03,002
This avaricious rogue tried to send
me with rich people several times.

1021
01:20:03,366 --> 01:20:05,835
But l refused.

1022
01:20:06,766 --> 01:20:10,703
ln his plot to loot
Mr. Vicky's wealth..

1023
01:20:10,766 --> 01:20:12,868
..he tried to make me help him.

1024
01:20:13,833 --> 01:20:15,701
lf one has to do all
this for one's daily bread..

1025
01:20:15,766 --> 01:20:18,401
..it's much better
to die of starvation.

1026
01:20:19,766 --> 01:20:23,736
l reject such kinds of obligations.

1027
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:25,901
l don't want such an
insulting agreement.

1028
01:20:26,233 --> 01:20:28,835
And now get out from here!

1029
01:20:30,766 --> 01:20:33,802
l am going. But remember..

1030
01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:37,703
..the respect accorded by you to me..

1031
01:20:37,766 --> 01:20:42,337
..in return, l will make
you dance to my tunes.

1032
01:20:46,766 --> 01:20:47,900
What will happen now?

1033
01:20:50,766 --> 01:20:54,069
Father.. don't worry.

1034
01:20:55,666 --> 01:20:57,367
l have got a job on television.

1035
01:20:58,933 --> 01:21:02,369
And my first programme is
scheduled for today itself.

1036
01:21:03,133 --> 01:21:06,636
Hello! Today, for the first time,
we are presenting before you..

1037
01:21:06,699 --> 01:21:10,036
..the famous stage artiste,
Miss. Meena.

1038
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:19,242
''l believe in love..''

1039
01:21:19,833 --> 01:21:24,137
''l wish everyone well.''

1040
01:21:25,933 --> 01:21:32,839
''l'm a friend to everyone..''

1041
01:21:33,266 --> 01:21:38,170
''l'm enemy to none.''

1042
01:21:59,566 --> 01:22:02,168
''Give me love..''

1043
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:09,138
''Give me love, give me your love.''

1044
01:22:09,633 --> 01:22:15,305
''Give me love, give me your love.''

1045
01:22:16,033 --> 01:22:19,770
''Whatever the world
thinks, l'm in love..

1046
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:23,636
..everywhere l go, l sing for you..''

1047
01:22:23,699 --> 01:22:25,068
''So give me love.''

1048
01:22:25,833 --> 01:22:29,102
''Give me love, give me your love.''

1049
01:22:29,633 --> 01:22:35,605
''Give me love, give me your love.''

1050
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:20,941
''Between our hearts, there
stands a wall. Let's bring it down.''

1051
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:33,245
''ln my heart.. light
the lamp of love.''

1052
01:23:37,699 --> 01:23:41,236
''When you're in love, you
find the whole world beautiful.''

1053
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:44,936
''The world belongs to us
and we belong to the world.''

1054
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,701
''So give me your love!''

1055
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:50,769
''Give me your love.. give me love.''

1056
01:23:50,933 --> 01:23:56,171
''Give me your love.. give me love.''

1057
01:23:56,733 --> 01:24:02,171
''Give me your love.. give me love.''

1058
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:08,072
''Give me your love.. give me love.''

1059
01:24:08,533 --> 01:24:13,938
''Give me your love.. give me love.''

1060
01:24:14,166 --> 01:24:16,635
''Give me your love..''

1061
01:24:16,666 --> 01:24:18,968
Where are you going?
- Wait. l will be back.

1062
01:24:50,866 --> 01:24:56,571
The other day, l had left
Meena here itself. Then..

1063
01:24:57,933 --> 01:25:03,004
..from here, perhaps
she went to the left..

1064
01:25:04,366 --> 01:25:05,467
No..

1065
01:25:09,433 --> 01:25:13,737
Shame on me! Thank God
l was not a postman.

1066
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:17,503
Otherwise, nobody would
have received their letter.

1067
01:25:23,466 --> 01:25:26,802
Excuse me, please.

1068
01:25:32,100 --> 01:25:39,707
Miss Meena lives in this colony.
Perhaps you might know her.

1069
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:42,435
She is a very famous artiste.

1070
01:25:43,433 --> 01:25:45,568
Her song had been featured
on television a while ago.

1071
01:25:45,833 --> 01:25:47,868
Can you tell me her whereabouts?

1072
01:25:49,566 --> 01:25:51,601
Hey! A knife?
- Yes.

1073
01:25:52,033 --> 01:25:54,635
This chain!
- It's a gold chain.

1074
01:25:54,733 --> 01:25:55,800
Yes, take it off!

1075
01:25:59,899 --> 01:26:00,934
Very good.

1076
01:26:03,533 --> 01:26:08,638
This watch is..
- Yes, remove the watch! Come on!

1077
01:26:09,466 --> 01:26:10,533
Take this.

1078
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:15,503
Your ring is very beautiful.
And my hands too are empty!

1079
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:18,869
You have taken everything. At least,
tell me Meena's address now.

1080
01:26:19,033 --> 01:26:21,435
We will tell you.
First unload your pocket.

1081
01:26:21,566 --> 01:26:25,503
Alright. Take the purse too! What's s
o important about it?

1082
01:26:25,866 --> 01:26:29,035
That handkerchief is my life..
- Shut up!

1083
01:26:31,433 --> 01:26:34,302
At least tell me Meena's address now.
- Tell him!

1084
01:26:34,366 --> 01:26:36,701
lt's every easy. Go
straight from here.

1085
01:26:36,766 --> 01:26:39,301
There are buildings to the left.
Stand there in the middle..

1086
01:26:39,366 --> 01:26:41,901
..and call out 'Meena Meena!' She
will come out, wherever she might be.

1087
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:46,435
This is very strange!

1088
01:26:47,633 --> 01:26:49,301
Ridiculous! They
took away everything..

1089
01:26:49,366 --> 01:26:51,735
..and they refuse to
tell me about Meena.

1090
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:53,668
Anyway, God bless you!

1091
01:26:54,766 --> 01:26:56,968
Let's go to Peter's
bar and have a booze.

1092
01:26:58,533 --> 01:27:01,969
l will find out Meena's whereabouts.

1093
01:27:09,899 --> 01:27:12,636
Meena?

1094
01:27:15,866 --> 01:27:17,667
Meena?

1095
01:27:21,633 --> 01:27:31,309
''Love is my creed.''

1096
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:35,837
''And l wish everyone well.''

1097
01:27:37,466 --> 01:27:44,806
''l'm a friend to everyone.''

1098
01:27:45,233 --> 01:27:50,304
''l'm enemy to none.''

1099
01:27:50,633 --> 01:27:52,901
Hold on, Mr. Bandmaster!

1100
01:27:52,966 --> 01:27:55,802
My Meena lives somewhere here.
l don't know her whereabouts.

1101
01:27:55,866 --> 01:27:58,335
Will you please play the band?
l will pay you later.

1102
01:27:58,399 --> 01:27:59,901
One, two, three, four..

1103
01:28:21,333 --> 01:28:24,436
''Give me love..''

1104
01:28:25,699 --> 01:28:31,672
''Give me love, give me your love.''

1105
01:28:31,733 --> 01:28:37,772
''Give me love, give me your love.''

1106
01:28:38,233 --> 01:28:42,203
''Whatever the world
thinks, l'm in love..

1107
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:45,569
..everywhere l go, l sing for you..''

1108
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:47,735
''So give me love.''

1109
01:28:48,233 --> 01:28:51,502
''Give me love, give me your love.''

1110
01:28:51,566 --> 01:28:57,238
''Give me love, give me your love.''

1111
01:29:35,166 --> 01:29:44,275
''The sun, the moon and the
stars show up every day.''

1112
01:29:45,333 --> 01:29:52,106
''My world is even then
plunged in darkness..

1113
01:29:52,133 --> 01:29:56,804
..you must show me the way out''

1114
01:30:00,699 --> 01:30:04,770
''lt's only your eyes
that shower love on me.''

1115
01:30:04,833 --> 01:30:08,236
''May my passions be sated.
May no one go thirsty.''

1116
01:30:08,300 --> 01:30:10,335
''So give me love..

1117
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:14,203
..give me love, give me your love.''

1118
01:30:14,266 --> 01:30:20,739
''Give me love, give me your love.''

1119
01:31:02,699 --> 01:31:11,408
''Between our hearts, there
stands a wall. Let's bring it down.''

1120
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:23,143
''ln my heart.. light
the lamp of love.''

1121
01:31:27,266 --> 01:31:31,236
''When you're in love, you
find the whole world beautiful.''

1122
01:31:31,266 --> 01:31:34,535
''The world belongs to us
and we belong to the world.''

1123
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:36,535
''So give me your love!''

1124
01:31:37,166 --> 01:31:40,469
''Give me your love.. give me love.''

1125
01:31:40,533 --> 01:31:46,639
''Give me your love.. give me love.''

1126
01:31:46,699 --> 01:31:52,639
''Give me your love.. give me love.''
- Hey Lord.

1127
01:31:52,699 --> 01:31:58,272
''Give me your love.. give me love.''

1128
01:31:58,399 --> 01:32:03,705
''Give me your love.. give me love.''

1129
01:32:04,066 --> 01:32:09,704
''Give me your love.. give me love.''

1130
01:32:10,100 --> 01:32:15,538
''Give me your love.. give me love.''

1131
01:32:16,033 --> 01:32:20,971
''Give me your love.. give me love.''

1132
01:32:21,033 --> 01:32:23,468
Why did you do this?
At this late hour..

1133
01:32:23,533 --> 01:32:25,568
..l heard you singing on television.

1134
01:32:31,100 --> 01:32:33,469
lt's believed that one
gets looted in love.

1135
01:32:33,533 --> 01:32:35,401
Today, l have truly been looted.

1136
01:32:36,199 --> 01:32:38,168
You have been looted? How's that?

1137
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:42,570
How should l tell you?
Anyway, l will tell you.

1138
01:32:45,966 --> 01:32:47,033
Shall l tell you?

1139
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:59,003
Come here.. quick!

1140
01:33:00,133 --> 01:33:04,070
l tell you everyday that my
name is Mohan. What do you want?

1141
01:33:04,133 --> 01:33:07,936
Can't you see? That the
bottle and the glass are empty?

1142
01:33:08,133 --> 01:33:11,803
And today, l am not
drinking on credit, but in cash.

1143
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,068
Fetch some more.
- l will get it right away.

1144
01:33:14,199 --> 01:33:17,570
He's a fool, really!

1145
01:33:21,266 --> 01:33:25,737
Come on.. serve me drinks.
- Mr. Vicky, you are here?

1146
01:33:26,233 --> 01:33:29,269
This is how it happens
in love or elections.

1147
01:33:29,733 --> 01:33:33,136
Sometimes one gets a plank,
and sometimes a throne.

1148
01:33:33,199 --> 01:33:35,936
But here you won't find
a drink that befits you.

1149
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:42,272
When there's no petrol, one
should make do with kerosene itself.

1150
01:33:42,666 --> 01:33:45,935
What do you have in your
hand? Yes, give it to me.

1151
01:33:46,133 --> 01:33:51,271
Yes.. this will do.
Tonight l will make do with this.

1152
01:33:53,666 --> 01:33:58,971
Gentlemen, if you
don't mind, can l sit here?

1153
01:33:59,066 --> 01:34:04,538
Be seated. - Thanks. Actually,
it's thanks to you. - Be seated.

1154
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:09,203
One finds decent people
with great difficulty.

1155
01:34:10,199 --> 01:34:14,137
On one end, it's you, and on
the other were those four crooks.

1156
01:34:14,666 --> 01:34:17,201
Whom are you talking about?
- They were..

1157
01:34:18,133 --> 01:34:24,205
..similar to you in
appearance but not in deeds.

1158
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:30,472
Just because l asked them
the whereabouts of my Meena..

1159
01:34:30,500 --> 01:34:36,472
..they brandished a knife,
and put it on my neck..

1160
01:34:36,533 --> 01:34:41,871
..and they removed my chain.
Thereafter they immediately..

1161
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,202
After that.. keep drinking..
don't stop, continue drinking.

1162
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:50,739
Removed my watch, then my purse.

1163
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:52,067
And then my finger ring.

1164
01:34:53,500 --> 01:34:56,803
But.. the only regret is..

1165
01:34:57,800 --> 01:35:03,939
..they took away my most
precious thing.. the handkerchief.

1166
01:35:04,433 --> 01:35:07,102
But where did this
incident take place?

1167
01:35:07,399 --> 01:35:11,804
Over there, at the junction.
l was passing through..

1168
01:35:11,933 --> 01:35:16,404
..and those idiots grabbed me
and took away everything l had.

1169
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:20,603
You appear to be decent people.

1170
01:35:20,866 --> 01:35:23,134
Those idiots were
standing on the road.

1171
01:35:23,733 --> 01:35:28,404
lf you find them, at least take back..

1172
01:35:28,466 --> 01:35:31,602
..my handkerchief from them.

1173
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:36,136
You are very decent people.
So unlike in deeds!

1174
01:35:36,433 --> 01:35:39,836
Give these people, soda!
Carry on, l will leave.

1175
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:46,402
l forgot to tell you
the most important thing.

1176
01:35:46,466 --> 01:35:48,134
Would you please get up, sir?

1177
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:51,868
Those four are crooks.

1178
01:35:52,466 --> 01:35:57,871
Those idiots brandish
their knives on every excuse.

1179
01:35:58,533 --> 01:36:00,601
lf you happen to meet them..

1180
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:04,737
..throw this knife
away the first thing.

1181
01:36:05,466 --> 01:36:08,735
Then move the chair, and
give a blow to one of them..

1182
01:36:11,366 --> 01:36:13,735
Then hold another by his neck,
and hit him on his stomach..

1183
01:36:14,399 --> 01:36:16,602
..so that he falls
down on the other hand.

1184
01:36:16,733 --> 01:36:19,068
Hang on, there's time.

1185
01:36:19,666 --> 01:36:23,736
Then these two will rise..

1186
01:36:28,399 --> 01:36:32,804
Then these two fell over there.
Now, the first one will rise.

1187
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:38,472
And then l will bash him up.
This one has fallen here.

1188
01:36:38,933 --> 01:36:44,338
Now the one who had been hit by
me before, he will rise slowly..

1189
01:36:44,366 --> 01:36:50,071
..and after getting up, he
will raise his left hand..

1190
01:36:54,733 --> 01:36:56,734
l forgot to tell you this..

1191
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:00,803
Among them, there will be one
who will attack without warning.

1192
01:37:00,933 --> 01:37:04,670
For such people, this
is what you should do.

1193
01:37:07,333 --> 01:37:10,269
Then the one who had
approached slowly from behind..

1194
01:37:10,333 --> 01:37:13,736
..he will come again,
and grab you from the back.

1195
01:37:14,500 --> 01:37:17,269
But he can't do much.
He will shake you up..

1196
01:37:17,300 --> 01:37:20,670
..but he won't do you a thing. It
is his friend who will do something.

1197
01:37:20,766 --> 01:37:24,402
As soon as he punches him,
grab him around like this.

1198
01:37:24,666 --> 01:37:26,401
Turn around the other like this.

1199
01:37:26,733 --> 01:37:29,669
Now the three of them have
become occupied. Now the fourth one..

1200
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:33,470
The fourth one will come in
the front, the first thing..

1201
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:38,271
He will try to give a punch.
Push one of them in the front..

1202
01:37:38,333 --> 01:37:42,336
..then when he will try to
punch again, push the second one.

1203
01:37:42,399 --> 01:37:45,336
When he tries to punch the
third time, push the third one.

1204
01:37:45,866 --> 01:37:49,002
Three are gone. Now the
fourth remains. So he should be..

1205
01:37:55,399 --> 01:37:56,934
How come you have grown smaller?

1206
01:37:57,666 --> 01:37:58,933
Sit here.

1207
01:38:13,666 --> 01:38:18,470
Take this, this, and this.

1208
01:38:26,600 --> 01:38:27,634
Vicky..

1209
01:38:34,399 --> 01:38:36,468
So my dear decent brothers..

1210
01:38:38,466 --> 01:38:43,204
On one hand, it's you, and on
the other, there were those crooks.

1211
01:38:43,266 --> 01:38:48,337
Those idiots aren't going to
return stolen goods easily.

1212
01:38:48,933 --> 01:38:52,670
They will have to be grabbed
by the collar and questioned..

1213
01:38:52,733 --> 01:38:58,638
'Tell me, where is the
chain?' He will remove the chain.

1214
01:38:59,433 --> 01:39:02,602
Then another will have to be
grabbed by the collar and asked..

1215
01:39:02,666 --> 01:39:05,168
'Tell me, where is the watch?'

1216
01:39:06,266 --> 01:39:07,667
He will remove the watch.

1217
01:39:08,466 --> 01:39:12,136
And before you catch the third
one by the collar and ask him..

1218
01:39:12,199 --> 01:39:16,404
..he will himself return
the purse and the ring.

1219
01:39:17,199 --> 01:39:21,137
Now comes the question
of that handkerchief..

1220
01:39:21,199 --> 01:39:25,203
..because of which the
matter could worsen further..

1221
01:39:25,399 --> 01:39:27,535
..that handkerchief..

1222
01:39:28,466 --> 01:39:31,735
ls this the handkerchief?
- Yes, this is the one.

1223
01:39:32,333 --> 01:39:35,202
Where did you find it?
- These people had thrown it here.

1224
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:43,206
Look, child, l can give my
entire wealth for this handkerchief.

1225
01:39:43,733 --> 01:39:48,137
But for the time being, all
the money that is in this purse..

1226
01:39:48,199 --> 01:39:51,536
..they are all yours.

1227
01:39:52,533 --> 01:39:54,334
Sir, so much money?

1228
01:39:55,333 --> 01:39:57,334
What do you do?

1229
01:39:57,800 --> 01:40:01,503
l study, and then
work here in the nights.

1230
01:40:01,666 --> 01:40:05,102
Look! Study wholeheartedly.

1231
01:40:05,766 --> 01:40:10,203
And if you ever need
anything in life, come to me.

1232
01:40:10,333 --> 01:40:11,400
Go on.

1233
01:40:12,466 --> 01:40:17,671
So my dear gentlemen!
Listen one more thing.

1234
01:40:19,133 --> 01:40:24,538
Tell those idiots that if
anybody asks for Meena's address..

1235
01:40:26,133 --> 01:40:28,802
..tell the correct address.
- Yes, we will.

1236
01:40:29,399 --> 01:40:35,072
No! Tell those idiots that if
anybody asks Meena's whereabouts..

1237
01:40:35,100 --> 01:40:39,471
..they shouldn't tell the address.

1238
01:40:40,166 --> 01:40:41,267
Never.

1239
01:40:41,800 --> 01:40:44,736
On one hand, it's you, and
on the other are those idiots!

1240
01:40:52,666 --> 01:40:55,602
The stuff is excellent. But
nobody will pay that much price.

1241
01:40:55,666 --> 01:40:57,200
Give me whatever you like. Hurry up!

1242
01:40:57,533 --> 01:41:00,736
l will deal with you
at the police station.

1243
01:41:01,333 --> 01:41:05,737
Come on. It's also a crime
to buy stolen goods. Come on!

1244
01:41:07,133 --> 01:41:08,534
lt's time already.

1245
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:10,535
This is very much like a
'swayamvar' (Bride chooses her husband)

1246
01:41:11,233 --> 01:41:13,001
The only difference is
that in earlier times..

1247
01:41:13,033 --> 01:41:14,734
..girls used to
choose their own husbands.

1248
01:41:15,199 --> 01:41:17,402
And today the boy
will choose his wife.

1249
01:41:18,133 --> 01:41:19,200
He must be coming any time now.

1250
01:41:19,266 --> 01:41:22,202
Here l come, daddy! Come, Accountant.
- Come, dear.

1251
01:41:22,466 --> 01:41:24,601
l am tired of having
girls tie rakhis on my wrist.

1252
01:41:27,133 --> 01:41:29,401
More sisters? There's
no place on my hand now.

1253
01:41:29,533 --> 01:41:31,468
Speak slowly. They
are not your sisters.

1254
01:41:31,666 --> 01:41:34,201
They are here for a marriage
alliance. - Marriage alliance?

1255
01:41:34,266 --> 01:41:38,069
Yes. l want you to get married no
w. You aren't drunk, are you?

1256
01:41:39,533 --> 01:41:40,734
No, l'm not drunk at all.

1257
01:41:41,033 --> 01:41:43,735
But today, l will drink myself,
as well as serve others too.

1258
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,034
Thank you very much.

1259
01:41:45,100 --> 01:41:48,136
We have already drunk tea.
- Shame on you, sir.

1260
01:41:48,266 --> 01:41:49,734
ls tea meant to be drunk?

1261
01:41:50,066 --> 01:41:52,735
Whoever hasn't drunk whiskey,
he is an unfortunate person.

1262
01:41:53,066 --> 01:41:56,202
Don't mind what he says.
Vicky is used to joking.

1263
01:41:56,266 --> 01:41:57,533
We too know that.

1264
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:03,070
Why are you looking at me angrily?
Please introduce me to them.

1265
01:42:03,133 --> 01:42:04,934
lt's a matter of my life.
Without introductions..

1266
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,535
..l don't even make
enemies with anybody.

1267
01:42:07,966 --> 01:42:12,203
Tell me, sir, what's your name?
- Gore. And she's my daughter, Kajal.

1268
01:42:12,399 --> 01:42:16,070
There! You are so dark-complexioned.

1269
01:42:16,133 --> 01:42:17,167
And you call yourself fair?
- Vicky!

1270
01:42:17,266 --> 01:42:18,634
l am happy being a
black after meeting you..

1271
01:42:19,033 --> 01:42:22,069
She's Miss. Laali, my daughter.
And l am Govardhan.

1272
01:42:22,133 --> 01:42:25,669
The Paper King!
- You mean the King of Paper?

1273
01:42:26,399 --> 01:42:29,336
l had heard about a paper boat.
Today l have met the Paper King too.

1274
01:42:29,466 --> 01:42:32,402
Move about carefully. If somebody
were to manhandle you, you'd be torn.

1275
01:42:32,466 --> 01:42:35,001
He's Mr. Rustom Bandookwala.

1276
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,669
He's Rustom, as well as a
Bandook too? You are an amazing person!

1277
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:42,670
He's Mr. Khaitan, the cement king.
- Glad to meet you..

1278
01:42:44,533 --> 01:42:47,669
The cement king collapsed.

1279
01:42:48,066 --> 01:42:50,334
No wonder buildings in
the city collapse so soon.

1280
01:42:50,366 --> 01:42:52,568
l can smell something
mixed in your mouth.

1281
01:42:53,033 --> 01:42:55,969
Don't take Vicky's
statements seriously.

1282
01:42:56,199 --> 01:42:59,202
Vicky is..
- Vicky is used to joking!

1283
01:42:59,266 --> 01:43:01,468
Looks like everybody
worked at a radio station!

1284
01:43:02,399 --> 01:43:04,668
Who are you, please?
- l am Chirag Daruwala!

1285
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:06,067
Daruwala!

1286
01:43:07,666 --> 01:43:10,935
We will make great company together.
Only you and l know the pleasure..

1287
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:15,671
..of drinking liquor after
the sunset. - Vicky. Vicky.

1288
01:43:16,199 --> 01:43:17,267
Come here.

1289
01:43:18,266 --> 01:43:22,370
There's a limit to joking. You
have to marry one of these girls.

1290
01:43:22,966 --> 01:43:25,234
One? Can l not marry all of them?
- Keep quiet!

1291
01:43:26,333 --> 01:43:28,134
So, ladies and gentlemen..

1292
01:43:28,966 --> 01:43:31,935
..if you don't mind, l want to talk..

1293
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:35,470
..to your daughters for my son's sake.

1294
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:40,137
Yes, of course. Go ahead.

1295
01:43:40,333 --> 01:43:44,403
l will get my son to marry a girl
who can make my son give up alcohol.

1296
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:50,672
That will be easy. l can make him
give up alcohol within one night.

1297
01:43:51,333 --> 01:43:55,270
How can you make him give up liquor?
You yourself drink liquor.

1298
01:43:55,300 --> 01:43:57,568
Look, uncle!
- You are not a chaste woman either.

1299
01:43:57,899 --> 01:43:59,101
You have seven boyfriends..

1300
01:43:59,166 --> 01:44:05,272
..one for each day of the week.

1301
01:44:05,399 --> 01:44:07,401
You don't even have a
day off on a holiday.

1302
01:44:08,399 --> 01:44:11,002
Listen to her good qualities now.

1303
01:44:11,133 --> 01:44:16,605
She introduces her every
boyfriend saying that he's her cousin.

1304
01:44:17,466 --> 01:44:18,600
You lousy woman.

1305
01:44:24,333 --> 01:44:26,134
You are my future wife?
- Yes.

1306
01:44:26,199 --> 01:44:28,302
And you got beaten
up by my future wife?

1307
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:30,201
Yes..
- Of course.

1308
01:44:34,933 --> 01:44:39,003
Leave me.
- You wretched woman.

1309
01:44:42,133 --> 01:44:46,470
You! Dirty woman.

1310
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:52,405
What do you think of yourself? l
will not spare you. Understood?

1311
01:44:53,333 --> 01:44:54,333
Accountant?

1312
01:44:58,333 --> 01:45:01,335
What do you think? Will the
black one win or the white one?

1313
01:45:20,266 --> 01:45:23,535
Look at this yellow one.
She will be overthrown now.

1314
01:45:23,800 --> 01:45:25,001
l am telling you, let go of me.

1315
01:45:26,399 --> 01:45:28,835
l think that the yellow one
is going to turn blue soon.

1316
01:45:29,199 --> 01:45:30,267
You want to marry him?

1317
01:45:40,233 --> 01:45:41,334
What happened here?

1318
01:45:53,199 --> 01:45:54,467
What a scene it is!

1319
01:45:55,133 --> 01:45:58,069
l had heard that
Dushashana had undressed Draupadi.

1320
01:45:58,133 --> 01:45:59,200
But l'm seeing for the..

1321
01:45:59,266 --> 01:46:01,134
..first time that a
Draupadi is undressing Draupadi.

1322
01:46:02,266 --> 01:46:03,333
Move. Move.

1323
01:46:04,066 --> 01:46:06,468
lt's not fit for you
to see. Let's go. - Why?

1324
01:46:08,866 --> 01:46:14,805
l'm very sorry. The thing is Vicky..
- Vicky likes to joke.

1325
01:46:16,333 --> 01:46:20,336
Sometimes, some jokes
can prove to be very dear.

1326
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:25,271
Shut up! First you insulted
me in the presence of guests.

1327
01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:27,001
You insulted me.

1328
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:30,769
And now you are wanting
to marry a dancing girl?

1329
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:34,870
lf you cannot respect someone,
you cannot insult anybody.

1330
01:46:35,800 --> 01:46:38,736
Meena is your future daughter-in-law.
Is a daughter-in-law..

1331
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:41,736
..addressed in this manner?
If Meena is a dancing girl..

1332
01:46:41,766 --> 01:46:45,436
..what were those girls who were
exposing one another in public?

1333
01:46:46,166 --> 01:46:51,337
A mobile advertisement.. the filthy
books which can be read by anybody?

1334
01:46:51,866 --> 01:46:56,136
l see.. since when have
you started taking decisions?

1335
01:46:56,800 --> 01:46:59,068
Meena is my life, my love.
She is not your industry.

1336
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,334
You may take decisions
about your business.

1337
01:47:01,399 --> 01:47:03,935
But l have every right to
take decisions about my life.

1338
01:47:04,266 --> 01:47:08,670
lf you want to make that
worthless dancer my daughter-in-law..

1339
01:47:08,733 --> 01:47:12,670
..you better know that this is
my home, not a dirty place..

1340
01:47:12,733 --> 01:47:17,370
..where one can hear the
tinkling sounds all round the clock.

1341
01:47:18,899 --> 01:47:23,137
Look at this home's grandeur
and then that girl's status.

1342
01:47:23,399 --> 01:47:27,704
Do you see this statue? An
antique. It costs 250,OOO.

1343
01:47:28,133 --> 01:47:31,402
And these two statues cost 325,OOO.

1344
01:47:32,066 --> 01:47:33,400
And look over there..

1345
01:47:34,699 --> 01:47:38,403
l bought that one specially for
you from Paris. For 1 .2 million.

1346
01:47:38,733 --> 01:47:41,669
The carpet, the chandelier..
for half-a-million.

1347
01:47:42,199 --> 01:47:46,704
l must've spent at least 5
million for decorating your room.

1348
01:47:47,066 --> 01:47:49,668
And you, who lives in such grandeur..

1349
01:47:49,699 --> 01:47:52,369
..the only son of Rai sir Amarnath..

1350
01:47:53,300 --> 01:47:56,002
You want to bring into this
home a girl who is a dancer?

1351
01:47:57,133 --> 01:48:01,003
She will be like an ugly
blot in the home's beauty.

1352
01:48:02,066 --> 01:48:06,637
l'm fond of embellishing
jewels in torn velvet..

1353
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:09,635
l don't stitch it up with thread.

1354
01:48:10,666 --> 01:48:13,802
Till today, you have done as
you pleased. l said nothing.

1355
01:48:14,866 --> 01:48:17,068
But today, you had
better hear carefully..

1356
01:48:17,733 --> 01:48:22,604
Till l am alive, a dancer
won't set her foot in this home..

1357
01:48:22,633 --> 01:48:24,835
..as my daughter-in-law. Understand?

1358
01:48:31,800 --> 01:48:35,603
Till l am alive, a dancer..

1359
01:48:35,666 --> 01:48:39,603
..won't set her foot in this home..

1360
01:48:39,666 --> 01:48:43,736
..as my daughter-in-law. Understand?

1361
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:47,637
But today, you had
better hear carefully..

1362
01:48:47,699 --> 01:48:52,604
Till l am alive, a dancer
won't set her foot in this home..

1363
01:48:52,666 --> 01:48:55,068
..as my daughter-in-law. Understand?

1364
01:48:55,733 --> 01:49:00,237
But today, you had
better hear carefully..

1365
01:49:00,666 --> 01:49:03,268
Till l am alive, a dancer
won't set her foot in this home..

1366
01:49:03,933 --> 01:49:09,004
..as my daughter-in-law. Understand?

1367
01:49:09,733 --> 01:49:15,271
And these two statues cost 325,OOO.

1368
01:49:15,566 --> 01:49:21,138
l bought that one specially for
you from Paris. For 1 .2 million.

1369
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:27,672
The carpet, the chandelier..
for half-a-million.

1370
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:34,867
You?

1371
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:38,001
Whose permission did you
take before coming here?

1372
01:49:39,066 --> 01:49:42,002
Didn't you hear what father just said?

1373
01:49:42,733 --> 01:49:45,268
You are a ugly blot on this home.

1374
01:49:46,266 --> 01:49:50,536
l am the only son of
Rai Amarnath Kapoor..

1375
01:49:50,600 --> 01:49:55,071
..who is fond of
embellishing jewels in the velvet.

1376
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:01,203
He has spent 5 million for
the decoration of this room.

1377
01:50:01,699 --> 01:50:05,470
This statue for 250,OOO. This
statue from Paris for 1 .2 million..

1378
01:50:05,500 --> 01:50:08,669
..this chandelier, this carpet..

1379
01:50:09,600 --> 01:50:12,536
And you.. what are you?

1380
01:50:15,600 --> 01:50:18,202
A dancer?

1381
01:50:20,666 --> 01:50:22,534
What's your status?

1382
01:50:24,133 --> 01:50:26,668
Go away from here. Or my
father will throw you out.

1383
01:50:26,733 --> 01:50:27,800
Go away!

1384
01:50:34,466 --> 01:50:35,500
Meena has gone away?

1385
01:50:36,866 --> 01:50:38,901
My Meena went away because of you.

1386
01:50:42,666 --> 01:50:46,202
All of you are slaves of my father.

1387
01:50:48,199 --> 01:50:52,470
Like my father, whenever
you got the opportunity..

1388
01:50:52,533 --> 01:50:56,536
..you washed down my
feelings with the power of money.

1389
01:50:58,733 --> 01:51:03,137
You tore away my
self-respect with a golden dagger.

1390
01:51:06,133 --> 01:51:09,402
You are my pleasures which
were taken away from me..

1391
01:51:09,433 --> 01:51:13,470
..and put in my home
as decorative pieces.

1392
01:51:16,533 --> 01:51:21,404
lt's you who made my father feel
that l have no right to be happy.

1393
01:51:23,800 --> 01:51:24,867
ln that case..

1394
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:29,134
ln that case..

1395
01:51:30,866 --> 01:51:32,534
A home where there is no love..

1396
01:51:33,600 --> 01:51:35,468
..why should there be
a love statue there?

1397
01:51:37,800 --> 01:51:39,468
Where there is no justice..

1398
01:51:39,533 --> 01:51:41,134
..why should there be
the scales of justice?

1399
01:51:44,433 --> 01:51:48,670
A home where there is no light
why should there be a chandelier?

1400
01:51:51,933 --> 01:51:54,935
A home where there isn't my Meena..
- Vicky! Vicky!

1401
01:51:56,533 --> 01:51:58,368
What are you doing?
- Meena?

1402
01:51:58,866 --> 01:52:03,470
Vicky?
- Meena? - Vicky? - Meena?

1403
01:52:03,733 --> 01:52:07,937
Vicky! My son.. come to your senses!

1404
01:52:14,566 --> 01:52:16,334
l want to speak to you.

1405
01:52:16,933 --> 01:52:18,768
Come upstairs quickly.
l have very less time.

1406
01:52:19,533 --> 01:52:21,735
Accountant, please stay back.

1407
01:53:13,533 --> 01:53:16,936
lf you try to meet him again,
you'll see the worst of me.

1408
01:53:17,800 --> 01:53:18,867
Get out of here!

1409
01:53:19,666 --> 01:53:20,733
Get out!

1410
01:53:27,399 --> 01:53:28,734
What happened, Meena?

1411
01:53:31,466 --> 01:53:35,736
Nothing, Accountant. l
had forgotten my status.

1412
01:53:36,866 --> 01:53:40,336
Vicky's father made me
realise that people..

1413
01:53:40,399 --> 01:53:43,936
..who cannot even touch
the dirt of their feet.

1414
01:53:45,366 --> 01:53:47,534
How can they hold their son's hand?

1415
01:54:00,533 --> 01:54:02,268
Excuse me..
- Yes, sir?

1416
01:54:03,333 --> 01:54:05,735
Miss Meena used to
stay here. Where is she?

1417
01:54:05,866 --> 01:54:08,735
She has gone away.
- What do you mean by that?

1418
01:54:08,866 --> 01:54:10,000
She has left the city today itself.

1419
01:54:11,399 --> 01:54:13,668
How do you know?
- l used to work with her.

1420
01:54:16,333 --> 01:54:17,467
Brothers and sisters.

1421
01:54:17,733 --> 01:54:23,338
Mr. Kapoor built so many schools,
orphanages and hospitals.

1422
01:54:23,466 --> 01:54:27,469
You all know very well how
much he has served you all.

1423
01:54:27,666 --> 01:54:30,268
But now, after winning the elections..

1424
01:54:30,300 --> 01:54:34,270
Mr. Kapoor would want
to love you as much as..

1425
01:54:34,333 --> 01:54:36,868
..a father loves his progeny!

1426
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:38,267
He is lying!

1427
01:54:53,399 --> 01:54:54,534
He is lying!

1428
01:54:57,600 --> 01:54:59,201
He couldn't take care of one child..

1429
01:54:59,266 --> 01:55:02,435
..and he wants to take care of
crores of namesake children.

1430
01:55:03,600 --> 01:55:06,436
Look at me! l am his only son.

1431
01:55:07,600 --> 01:55:09,201
l started drinking since childhood..

1432
01:55:09,266 --> 01:55:11,401
..and l have been shaky ever since.

1433
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:17,538
He hasn't even spent as
many minutes as my age is.

1434
01:55:17,666 --> 01:55:19,734
How the hell will he
be able to love you!

1435
01:55:21,800 --> 01:55:23,801
lt's not that he doesn't
have love in his heart.

1436
01:55:24,333 --> 01:55:27,936
He has plenty of love.
But only for wealth.

1437
01:55:29,866 --> 01:55:33,536
He's not a human being.

1438
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:34,834
He's a machine..

1439
01:55:35,600 --> 01:55:40,338
..which prints currency and
consumes currency. Nothing else.

1440
01:55:42,733 --> 01:55:45,802
The world is hungry for food.
But he is hungry for money.

1441
01:55:47,600 --> 01:55:53,605
Not love, he is
intoxicated about wealth.

1442
01:55:55,733 --> 01:55:59,870
ln my lonely life, l too
had got a little love.

1443
01:56:00,533 --> 01:56:04,870
But he chopped off my love's
neck with the sword of wealth.

1444
01:56:06,266 --> 01:56:08,868
You are hoping for
Iove from such a killer?

1445
01:56:09,366 --> 01:56:12,135
What are you saying, Mr. Vicky?
- Hold on, Mr. Saxena.

1446
01:56:12,333 --> 01:56:13,667
l haven't finished yet.

1447
01:56:14,333 --> 01:56:15,867
My dear poor friends..

1448
01:56:16,866 --> 01:56:20,135
Till today, l remained
entangled in his swamp of wealth..

1449
01:56:20,199 --> 01:56:23,136
..only because l
wanted to take you out..

1450
01:56:23,199 --> 01:56:25,869
..of the swamp of hunger and poverty.

1451
01:56:26,399 --> 01:56:30,137
l wanted to share your sorrows.
But from today..

1452
01:56:30,199 --> 01:56:31,601
..don't place any hopes on me.

1453
01:56:32,666 --> 01:56:35,135
Because in your presence,
l plead to my father that..

1454
01:56:35,199 --> 01:56:37,135
..he should disinherit
me from his wealth..

1455
01:56:37,199 --> 01:56:39,602
..that he should
free me from this jail.

1456
01:56:41,466 --> 01:56:42,867
l am feeling very sorry.

1457
01:56:44,333 --> 01:56:46,501
l used to think that l am
the son of a millionaire.

1458
01:56:46,566 --> 01:56:50,269
But today l realised that
l am the son of a beggar..

1459
01:56:51,866 --> 01:56:56,670
..who is standing before
you today, begging for votes.

1460
01:56:59,800 --> 01:57:01,201
l am feeling very sorry.

1461
01:57:02,399 --> 01:57:03,467
l am feeling very sorry.

1462
01:57:04,600 --> 01:57:06,601
Please stay back, Accountant.

1463
01:57:08,333 --> 01:57:11,335
Mr. Vicky..
- How are you, Anwar?

1464
01:57:11,666 --> 01:57:15,669
l am fine. But l saw a
very strange aspect of you.

1465
01:57:16,266 --> 01:57:19,102
You used to speak of love.
Today, you were showering fire!

1466
01:57:19,300 --> 01:57:21,802
When there is fire,
there will be smoke.

1467
01:57:22,466 --> 01:57:24,467
What's the matter? Tell me.

1468
01:57:25,466 --> 01:57:28,802
How should l tell you?
l have lost my life.

1469
01:57:29,466 --> 01:57:31,734
Lodge a complaint. l will find it.

1470
01:57:32,133 --> 01:57:34,735
Let it be, officer. You
couldn't find a necklace.

1471
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:36,668
How will you find my life?

1472
01:57:37,266 --> 01:57:40,268
l will prove to you that..

1473
01:57:40,533 --> 01:57:43,068
..we policemen can
search the wealth of love..

1474
01:57:43,133 --> 01:57:45,535
..in addition to the
wealth of the lockers.

1475
01:57:46,399 --> 01:57:49,269
Anyway, today is a very
important day of my life.

1476
01:57:50,100 --> 01:57:52,268
And l would like you
to come today evening..

1477
01:57:53,333 --> 01:57:54,534
Just a minute. Just minute.

1478
01:57:55,133 --> 01:57:57,735
One shouldn't invite dejected
people on a joyous occasion.

1479
01:57:58,533 --> 01:57:59,734
lt spoils the fun.

1480
01:58:00,533 --> 01:58:05,037
Those whose heart is broken
don't break others' hearts.

1481
01:58:05,266 --> 01:58:08,535
lf you don't come, l won't celebrate.

1482
01:58:09,066 --> 01:58:11,268
Alright, l will come. Tonight, right?

1483
01:58:11,333 --> 01:58:13,201
Yes. l will
personally come to pick you.

1484
01:58:13,733 --> 01:58:15,734
Alright.
- Goodbye.

1485
01:58:17,199 --> 01:58:19,735
This day is a very
important day of my life.

1486
01:58:20,399 --> 01:58:24,003
Years ago, this day, some
angel supported my helpless life..

1487
01:58:24,033 --> 01:58:27,536
..and caused me to
reach this destination.

1488
01:58:28,600 --> 01:58:31,269
l don't know who that
angel is.. where he is..

1489
01:58:31,666 --> 01:58:34,001
..but l pray to God..
wherever he might be..

1490
01:58:34,066 --> 01:58:37,269
..he should be bestowed
with every joy in the world.

1491
01:58:38,533 --> 01:58:40,601
l celebrate this day in his memory.

1492
01:58:42,533 --> 01:58:46,737
Ladies and gentlemen, he is my
very good friend, Mr. Vicky Kapoor.

1493
01:58:47,133 --> 01:58:49,268
Mr. Anwar, who doesn't know him?

1494
01:58:49,399 --> 01:58:53,170
Then you must also be knowing
that he is fond of poetry too.

1495
01:58:53,466 --> 01:58:56,635
What say, Mr. Vicky? How about
some poetry on this joyous occasion?

1496
01:58:58,433 --> 01:59:04,205
A broken heart
cannot sing a joyous tune.

1497
01:59:05,133 --> 01:59:08,936
But you just mentioned about
reaching the destination..

1498
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:13,671
..so l remembered something.
l will recite it.

1499
01:59:24,266 --> 01:59:30,372
''At the goals they seek..

1500
01:59:32,033 --> 01:59:37,204
..hearts are often shattered.''

1501
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:45,940
''Near the shores so very often..

1502
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:51,972
..love is sunk.''

1503
02:00:04,066 --> 02:00:13,208
''The goal and the path
have their own places.''

1504
02:00:13,899 --> 02:00:22,608
''The goal and the path
have their own places.''

1505
02:00:23,266 --> 02:00:29,872
''What does the traveller do when his..

1506
02:00:29,933 --> 02:00:33,403
..own feet let him down?''

1507
02:00:39,933 --> 02:00:48,608
''l do have a
sympathizer and a friend.''

1508
02:00:49,333 --> 02:00:58,208
''l do have a
sympathizer and a friend.''

1509
02:00:58,866 --> 02:01:09,042
''But what would my heart say if he
did not extend his hand to help?''

1510
02:01:10,500 --> 02:01:19,542
''The goal and the path
have their own places.''

1511
02:01:50,399 --> 02:01:59,475
''The one who is drowning,
clutches even at a straw.''

1512
02:01:59,933 --> 02:02:08,775
''That which gives his heart
hope, is a reassuring look.''

1513
02:02:09,199 --> 02:02:17,975
''But if lightning were to strike..''

1514
02:02:18,433 --> 02:02:25,740
''What would the one in..

1515
02:02:25,800 --> 02:02:28,869
.. deep waters do?''

1516
02:02:30,266 --> 02:02:39,475
''The goal and the path
have their own places.''

1517
02:03:05,066 --> 02:03:09,470
''lf falling in love is a crime..

1518
02:03:09,933 --> 02:03:14,003
..a crime, l have committed.''

1519
02:03:14,333 --> 02:03:23,241
''But those who deserve pardon,
do not commit such sins.''

1520
02:03:23,766 --> 02:03:28,737
''lt's a world of
stone-hearted people..''

1521
02:03:28,800 --> 02:03:32,470
''So is my beloved.''

1522
02:03:32,933 --> 02:03:37,337
''What might one's obsession do then?''

1523
02:03:37,766 --> 02:03:43,004
''And what might
become of his courage?''

1524
02:03:44,333 --> 02:03:53,208
''The goal and the path
have their own places.''

1525
02:03:53,699 --> 02:03:58,671
''When his own feet let him do..

1526
02:03:58,699 --> 02:04:03,738
..what is the traveller to do?''

1527
02:04:09,866 --> 02:04:18,708
''l do have a
sympathizer and a friend.''

1528
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:25,673
''But what would my
heart say if he did..

1529
02:04:25,733 --> 02:04:28,869
..not extend his hand to help?''

1530
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:39,067
Vicky sir.

1531
02:04:39,333 --> 02:04:40,801
Mr. Vicky, you are going away,
giving me only half the happiness?

1532
02:04:41,199 --> 02:04:43,869
You had promised that you
will surely visit my home.

1533
02:04:44,666 --> 02:04:50,138
lnspector, l am not used
to visiting people's homes.

1534
02:04:50,199 --> 02:04:53,336
But since you insist, l will come.

1535
02:04:53,800 --> 02:04:54,867
Please come.

1536
02:04:56,199 --> 02:04:58,068
l am very thankful to you.

1537
02:05:02,133 --> 02:05:03,200
Please come, Mr. Vicky.

1538
02:05:03,899 --> 02:05:05,001
Most welcome.

1539
02:05:06,300 --> 02:05:09,336
Yes.. how wonderful!

1540
02:05:10,666 --> 02:05:16,338
The home is a bit small but
a home should be like this.

1541
02:05:34,199 --> 02:05:35,234
You?

1542
02:05:36,633 --> 02:05:37,900
Where have you been?

1543
02:05:40,266 --> 02:05:42,801
l have become all
alone in this big world.

1544
02:05:45,133 --> 02:05:47,001
Don't punish me like this again.

1545
02:05:49,133 --> 02:05:52,669
lf you are lost, will
Vicky be able to live then?

1546
02:05:53,800 --> 02:05:55,134
Don't speak like this.

1547
02:05:56,066 --> 02:05:57,133
Don't speak like this.

1548
02:05:57,199 --> 02:06:02,071
Really? Really, Meena?

1549
02:06:03,933 --> 02:06:05,534
l have never lived till today.

1550
02:06:06,733 --> 02:06:08,668
l have got life only after l got you.

1551
02:06:11,566 --> 02:06:12,667
Vicky.

1552
02:06:15,800 --> 02:06:20,738
Mr. Vicky, didn't l say that l w
ill find you your life?

1553
02:06:21,933 --> 02:06:27,004
Here's your life, and
here's her lost necklace.

1554
02:06:29,266 --> 02:06:32,002
Miss. Meena was leaving the city a
Iong with her father.

1555
02:06:32,199 --> 02:06:34,936
lt's nice that l noticed
them and brought them here.

1556
02:06:35,600 --> 02:06:37,668
l hope you don't have any
complaints against the police now.

1557
02:06:38,066 --> 02:06:44,138
Why should l have any complaint?
l am indebted to you from today.

1558
02:06:44,833 --> 02:06:46,734
How will l repay your debt?

1559
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:50,803
Just by not considering
we policemen as useless.

1560
02:06:53,199 --> 02:06:56,736
lnspector, one more obligation..

1561
02:07:00,066 --> 02:07:05,471
l am handing you my belongings to..

1562
02:07:05,533 --> 02:07:08,502
..you for a few days.

1563
02:07:17,566 --> 02:07:18,667
Hi.

1564
02:07:20,533 --> 02:07:22,201
Who are you?
- It's me, Vicky darling.

1565
02:07:22,533 --> 02:07:24,868
l am crazy about you.
- What are you doing here?

1566
02:07:25,199 --> 02:07:27,502
l was waiting for you.
- Get out of the car.

1567
02:07:27,666 --> 02:07:28,800
What if l don't?

1568
02:07:29,666 --> 02:07:32,869
l'll pick you up and throw you out!
- Then do it, please.

1569
02:07:34,466 --> 02:07:36,868
Hey! You've really picked me up.

1570
02:07:41,666 --> 02:07:42,733
Out.

1571
02:07:43,600 --> 02:07:44,667
Hello, everybody.

1572
02:07:44,733 --> 02:07:46,201
Mr. Kapoor, look at this.

1573
02:07:49,666 --> 02:07:50,700
No!

1574
02:07:52,933 --> 02:07:55,802
Tell me, Meena.. who is this Ballo?

1575
02:07:56,666 --> 02:07:57,933
Natwar Shah's mistress.

1576
02:08:02,600 --> 02:08:05,669
So this is the game played
by Natwar and his mistress.

1577
02:08:07,133 --> 02:08:09,602
Where will Natwar be?
- At Shalimar Hall.

1578
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:11,067
His first show is scheduled today.

1579
02:08:13,933 --> 02:08:16,135
Now watch the fun of my liquor.

1580
02:08:16,866 --> 02:08:19,835
Remember, l had told you that
l will make you a famous star?

1581
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:21,134
And that day has come today..

1582
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,102
lt's you, Vicky?
- Speak respectfully.

1583
02:08:24,833 --> 02:08:26,601
l am what l am, and
you are what you are.

1584
02:08:26,666 --> 02:08:31,137
Yes, l meant the same. It's
nice that you came here today.

1585
02:08:31,600 --> 02:08:34,869
l am going to present these
two girls on the stage today.

1586
02:08:35,933 --> 02:08:38,135
The first and the last time.
- Yes.. what did you say?

1587
02:08:38,866 --> 02:08:41,401
By getting my pictures
published in the newspapers..

1588
02:08:41,466 --> 02:08:44,068
..you invited me to come here.
So l have come here.

1589
02:08:44,133 --> 02:08:47,669
Now l will heartily
encourage you and your girls.

1590
02:08:48,133 --> 02:08:50,435
lt's time for the show.
l am in a bit of a hurry.

1591
02:08:50,666 --> 02:08:54,669
Come.. hold on, Natwar. The
show will be held here instead.

1592
02:08:54,733 --> 02:08:57,769
Mr. Sehgal!
- Yes, Mr. Vicky? Yes.

1593
02:08:58,533 --> 02:09:00,067
Have you brought all the goods?
- Yes.

1594
02:09:00,533 --> 02:09:02,868
What have you brought?
- 2000 rotten eggs..

1595
02:09:03,800 --> 02:09:06,068
3000 old and worn out sandals..

1596
02:09:07,399 --> 02:09:09,735
..and 5000 rotten
oranges and tomatoes.

1597
02:09:10,933 --> 02:09:12,401
Wait.. where are you going?

1598
02:09:12,466 --> 02:09:14,334
Accountant, go with Mr. Sehgal..

1599
02:09:14,399 --> 02:09:18,403
..and distribute these goods in
equal quantity among the public.

1600
02:09:19,066 --> 02:09:20,467
Sit down, Natwar.
- As you say.

1601
02:09:21,666 --> 02:09:23,334
Makhan Singh.
- Here it is, sir.

1602
02:09:26,933 --> 02:09:28,734
Mr. Vicky, what's this?

1603
02:09:29,733 --> 02:09:33,870
There will be a celebration
for making me famous overnight.

1604
02:09:34,533 --> 02:09:38,603
Both of them will dance and you
will drink both these bottles.

1605
02:09:38,933 --> 02:09:42,069
l? But l don't drink liquor!

1606
02:09:42,399 --> 02:09:44,602
lt's my job to make you drink liquor.

1607
02:09:45,600 --> 02:09:47,068
The show will be something like this.

1608
02:09:48,666 --> 02:09:51,335
That.. till you drink, they
will dance, and till they dance..

1609
02:09:51,399 --> 02:09:54,736
..you will continue drinking.
Come on, start!

1610
02:09:57,666 --> 02:10:01,803
Mr. Vicky. It's a big sin to make
someone drink liquor forcefully.

1611
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:05,470
What's sin and what's good,
l know very well. Start!

1612
02:10:07,333 --> 02:10:08,400
O Lord!

1613
02:10:09,866 --> 02:10:11,000
lt's very bitter, Mr. Vicky.

1614
02:11:55,733 --> 02:12:01,672
Vicky, you always said that l
should disinherit you from my wealth.

1615
02:12:02,266 --> 02:12:03,333
That l should liberate you.

1616
02:12:04,266 --> 02:12:08,203
Sign these papers. l am
disinheriting you from today.

1617
02:12:08,533 --> 02:12:11,669
Mr. Kapoor, you..
- No, you won't say a thing today.

1618
02:12:13,166 --> 02:12:15,334
Who knows? Daddy might change
his decision under your influence.

1619
02:12:15,366 --> 02:12:16,433
Give me the pen, Mr. Saxena.

1620
02:12:18,733 --> 02:12:20,668
You should have done
this long before, daddy.

1621
02:12:21,866 --> 02:12:23,667
Anyway, better late than never.

1622
02:12:24,866 --> 02:12:27,535
Many thanks to you. You
have been very kind to me.

1623
02:12:28,466 --> 02:12:32,269
You have liberated Vicky who
was bound by the chain of wealth.

1624
02:12:33,266 --> 02:12:35,868
Here.. everything is
in your name from today.

1625
02:12:37,866 --> 02:12:42,136
Once l had given these
things to some decent people..

1626
02:12:42,199 --> 02:12:45,536
..to find Meena's address.

1627
02:12:46,666 --> 02:12:49,135
Today, to find my own address,
to identify my own self..

1628
02:12:49,166 --> 02:12:52,736
..l am handing over these
things to a decent man again.

1629
02:12:53,333 --> 02:12:55,134
Because those decent
people too loved these things..

1630
02:12:55,199 --> 02:12:56,334
..and you too love them.

1631
02:12:57,733 --> 02:13:00,869
One minute. There's one more
precious thing to be returned.

1632
02:13:02,133 --> 02:13:05,336
Here.. a wealth on
which you have no right..

1633
02:13:05,399 --> 02:13:09,537
l too have no right to keep a
gift bought with such a wealth.

1634
02:13:12,733 --> 02:13:15,135
Did you see, daddy?
This is my choice..

1635
02:13:15,199 --> 02:13:18,803
..and this is your choice.

1636
02:13:21,166 --> 02:13:22,233
Let's go, Meena.

1637
02:13:23,733 --> 02:13:26,869
Where are you coming, Accountant?
- With my son, where else?

1638
02:13:27,433 --> 02:13:31,136
Where will you go with me? - Remember,
l was leaving this home one day..

1639
02:13:31,199 --> 02:13:34,536
..and you had prevented me.

1640
02:13:34,733 --> 02:13:38,203
Today, you are leaving. Then do l h
ave no right to accompany you?

1641
02:13:39,533 --> 02:13:42,269
l was living in this
home only for your sake.

1642
02:13:42,333 --> 02:13:46,370
Or l would've left a long time ago.
Who else besides you, do l have?

1643
02:13:46,433 --> 02:13:50,804
But, there ought to be a
walking stick where the blind live.

1644
02:13:50,866 --> 02:13:54,703
These wealthy people use only
sticks made of gold and silver.

1645
02:13:55,100 --> 02:13:58,203
lt's against their status to
even touch a walking-stick like me.

1646
02:13:58,266 --> 02:13:59,367
Let's go.

1647
02:14:11,366 --> 02:14:14,602
Mr. Vicky, all of us
are so obliged to you..

1648
02:14:14,666 --> 02:14:18,169
..that we cannot repay your
debts even in a thousand births.

1649
02:14:18,233 --> 02:14:22,503
What debt? The Almighty had
sent a money order in your name.

1650
02:14:22,566 --> 02:14:25,702
That money order was lying locked
in the lockers of wealthy people.

1651
02:14:26,466 --> 02:14:29,168
l merely opened the locker
and delivered the money to you.

1652
02:14:29,199 --> 02:14:30,367
What's the obligation in it?

1653
02:14:31,100 --> 02:14:34,102
Moreover, l have
taken a new birth, today.

1654
02:14:34,466 --> 02:14:37,468
All my life, l was walking
with the support of wealth.

1655
02:14:37,533 --> 02:14:40,335
Today, l am attempting to walk on m
y own feet. So let me walk.

1656
02:14:40,533 --> 02:14:43,435
No! We won't let you go.

1657
02:14:43,500 --> 02:14:48,137
Mr. Nathulal, for the time being,
you should leave Meena home.

1658
02:14:49,100 --> 02:14:51,402
As you wish.
- Go home with him.

1659
02:14:51,466 --> 02:14:52,466
l will meet you later.

1660
02:14:53,500 --> 02:14:54,567
Let's go, Accountant.

1661
02:15:00,433 --> 02:15:01,500
Mr. Vicky!

1662
02:15:03,033 --> 02:15:08,104
What are you doing? Now you
don't have to bow down to me.

1663
02:15:08,466 --> 02:15:13,003
l'm not bowing, l'm expressing
my thanks to that noble person..

1664
02:15:13,066 --> 02:15:17,336
..who made me what l am.
- A noble person.. and me?

1665
02:15:18,399 --> 02:15:23,071
Yes, the same noble person whom l
had been searching since childhood.

1666
02:15:23,600 --> 02:15:26,002
The one who paid for all
my educational expenses..

1667
02:15:26,066 --> 02:15:28,134
..and made me reach this destination.

1668
02:15:29,433 --> 02:15:36,506
You are the one?
- Yes.

1669
02:15:37,100 --> 02:15:39,402
The headmaster has told me everything.

1670
02:15:40,366 --> 02:15:43,702
l am the same Anwar whose tears
you wiped off in the childhood.

1671
02:15:45,100 --> 02:15:48,102
l see.. so the
Master broke his promise!

1672
02:15:48,699 --> 02:15:54,038
During his last moments, he
broke his promise on my insistence.

1673
02:15:55,399 --> 02:15:57,001
He's no more.

1674
02:15:59,033 --> 02:16:02,636
Remember, you had
praised my little home once.

1675
02:16:04,466 --> 02:16:08,636
Now this poor friend is
inviting you to live in that home.

1676
02:16:09,566 --> 02:16:12,936
Mr. Anwar.. l have just
been released from the world..

1677
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:17,204
..of gold and silver
and a world of dreams.

1678
02:16:17,266 --> 02:16:19,668
Let the sun rise first.

1679
02:16:20,333 --> 02:16:23,936
The reality of the world..
the face of the reality..

1680
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:27,069
..let me see the true
colours of human beings.

1681
02:16:27,133 --> 02:16:31,136
After all, you are there, l am
also there. We will keep on meeting.

1682
02:16:32,200 --> 02:16:33,267
Let's go, Accountant.

1683
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:41,536
What happened, Accountant?
- Nothing, dear. l am tired. Ok..

1684
02:16:44,033 --> 02:16:46,034
Stop the car, driver.

1685
02:16:46,333 --> 02:16:49,202
Vicky dear, you are here?

1686
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,969
l hear that your
father has disinherited you?

1687
02:16:53,200 --> 02:16:55,936
How would he know the value
of a diamond. Come with me.

1688
02:16:56,266 --> 02:16:57,967
Where?
- To my home.

1689
02:16:58,033 --> 02:17:01,469
By taking you to my home, l want
to give your father a fitting reply.

1690
02:17:02,933 --> 02:17:07,237
Nobody but l can give a
fitting reply to my father.

1691
02:17:08,033 --> 02:17:11,870
And l've already given him that
reply. As for going to your home..

1692
02:17:11,899 --> 02:17:16,004
..l know why you are
being so kind to me.

1693
02:17:16,899 --> 02:17:21,304
You have your only daughter and
you want to fulfill her desire.

1694
02:17:22,166 --> 02:17:26,136
l'm also the son of a businessman. l
have just walked away from a ocean.

1695
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,869
Mr. Govardhan, those
who swim the oceans..

1696
02:17:30,933 --> 02:17:36,204
..don't take a dip in wells
and lakes. Do you understand?

1697
02:17:36,933 --> 02:17:39,935
No? The matter is grave.

1698
02:17:40,200 --> 02:17:41,301
Let's go, Accountant.

1699
02:17:44,966 --> 02:17:47,868
Now just see how l set your level.

1700
02:17:47,899 --> 02:17:51,270
l don't deserve to be
called sir Govardhan..

1701
02:17:54,966 --> 02:18:00,905
Yes.. after roaming around the
entire city, this place looks fine.

1702
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:05,436
Wow! There's so much peace here.

1703
02:18:07,466 --> 02:18:10,368
What better place than
this to spend the night?

1704
02:18:10,433 --> 02:18:14,904
By the way, the condition of
this temple is somewhat like mine.

1705
02:18:14,966 --> 02:18:20,438
l think that mankind has
removed God from here too.

1706
02:18:21,799 --> 02:18:23,401
Let's sleep here itself.

1707
02:18:24,100 --> 02:18:28,938
Dear, l will be able to sleep. But
would you be able to sleep here?

1708
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:30,968
Don't worry about me.

1709
02:18:32,833 --> 02:18:34,801
Tonight, l'll sleep so well..

1710
02:18:34,866 --> 02:18:37,068
..l'll feel as if l'm
sleeping after a long time.

1711
02:18:38,100 --> 02:18:39,167
Go to sleep.

1712
02:18:42,166 --> 02:18:48,539
Life is ruined just like this.

1713
02:18:51,799 --> 02:18:53,067
l have fallen.

1714
02:18:53,833 --> 02:18:58,370
l hope you haven't been
hurt. Please forgive me.

1715
02:19:29,233 --> 02:19:31,735
The quantity of liquor
in it is so little..

1716
02:19:31,799 --> 02:19:35,870
..l used to leave this
quantity just like that as leftovers.

1717
02:20:14,033 --> 02:20:17,936
Where did Accountant go?

1718
02:20:18,899 --> 02:20:20,401
Sir..
- Who are you?

1719
02:20:21,100 --> 02:20:25,003
Don't you recognise me, sir?
That day, at the liquor den..

1720
02:20:25,066 --> 02:20:27,935
..when you had gifted me your
purse in exchange for the handkerchief.

1721
02:20:28,333 --> 02:20:31,335
lt contained 5,500 rupees.
- Yes, l remembered.

1722
02:20:31,399 --> 02:20:33,068
l have started a tea
shop with that money.

1723
02:20:33,266 --> 02:20:36,769
l have even rented a room.
My mother praises you a lot.

1724
02:20:37,166 --> 02:20:40,335
You are fortunate that you
have a mother and her love too.

1725
02:20:40,733 --> 02:20:45,070
With your grace, sir.
- Don't join hands in front of others.

1726
02:20:45,133 --> 02:20:48,269
Else, once the purpose is
served people break the hands.

1727
02:20:49,233 --> 02:20:52,869
Work hard, be happy, and
take care of your mother. Yes..

1728
02:20:53,100 --> 02:20:56,937
l had brought tea for you.
- l don't drink tea.

1729
02:20:57,233 --> 02:21:00,736
l am searching for Accountant.
l wonder where he has gone.

1730
02:21:00,799 --> 02:21:04,270
lf you happen to see
Accountant somewhere, do let me know.

1731
02:21:04,333 --> 02:21:05,600
Alright.

1732
02:21:07,033 --> 02:21:08,100
Here, take these 25 rupees.

1733
02:21:10,633 --> 02:21:14,103
Only 25 bucks?
- Want more? Make some more trips.

1734
02:21:14,933 --> 02:21:16,000
Alright.

1735
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,669
He's bleeding!
- Let's take him to the hospital.

1736
02:22:10,166 --> 02:22:13,936
l won't go to the hospital.
l have to do a lot of work.

1737
02:22:13,966 --> 02:22:16,768
What happened?
- You need to go to the hospital.

1738
02:22:16,833 --> 02:22:18,901
Yes, let's go.
- It's Accountant.

1739
02:22:19,233 --> 02:22:21,802
The hospital is nearby. Come on..

1740
02:22:21,866 --> 02:22:25,669
First let me do the work.
Then take me to the hospital.

1741
02:22:28,633 --> 02:22:32,103
Doctor, where's Accountant
Phoolchand? - In that room over there.

1742
02:22:33,166 --> 02:22:36,269
How is he, doctor?
- His chances of survival are slim.

1743
02:22:58,133 --> 02:22:59,200
Accountant.

1744
02:23:08,633 --> 02:23:11,969
How could you do this?

1745
02:23:15,133 --> 02:23:16,200
Why did you do this?

1746
02:23:19,233 --> 02:23:22,669
What compelled you to do this?

1747
02:23:26,733 --> 02:23:28,734
Tell me, what
compelled you to do this?

1748
02:23:30,533 --> 02:23:32,101
My son..

1749
02:23:34,166 --> 02:23:37,802
l continued to tolerate
life's heartlessness all my life.

1750
02:23:39,033 --> 02:23:46,206
But l couldn't tolerate your
yearning for liquor last night.

1751
02:23:48,766 --> 02:23:53,470
l know that you can
survive without bread..

1752
02:23:53,500 --> 02:23:56,769
..but not without liquor.

1753
02:23:58,066 --> 02:24:03,171
Son, look what l have brought for you!

1754
02:24:12,533 --> 02:24:13,600
You..

1755
02:24:15,700 --> 02:24:20,538
For this, you left me alone?

1756
02:24:22,933 --> 02:24:26,603
Do you have the right to
be so angry at your son?

1757
02:24:29,066 --> 02:24:30,700
You are everything l have.

1758
02:24:32,933 --> 02:24:36,469
Sorrow, anger, love, affection..

1759
02:24:36,533 --> 02:24:40,203
..my tears, my childhood, my youth..

1760
02:24:41,566 --> 02:24:43,200
l have lived it all in your laps.

1761
02:24:45,933 --> 02:24:47,467
For the sake of this one bottle..

1762
02:24:47,533 --> 02:24:50,168
. .you are going away,
making my life mean ing less?

1763
02:24:55,899 --> 02:24:57,534
Don't go, Accountant.

1764
02:25:02,433 --> 02:25:03,600
Don't go, Accountant.

1765
02:25:05,500 --> 02:25:11,539
l take your oath l
will stop drinking liquor.

1766
02:25:11,600 --> 02:25:14,102
This, l have quit liquor.

1767
02:25:19,466 --> 02:25:21,467
See this, Accountant.
l have stopped liquor.

1768
02:25:21,799 --> 02:25:24,802
You can see that l have
stopped drinking liquor.

1769
02:25:24,866 --> 02:25:28,402
But don't you go leaving me behind.

1770
02:25:28,466 --> 02:25:31,001
But don't you go leaving me behind.

1771
02:25:33,733 --> 02:25:36,602
You took care of me all my life.

1772
02:25:37,633 --> 02:25:39,534
You supported me.

1773
02:25:41,799 --> 02:25:44,135
Now give me the
opportunity that l can serve you.

1774
02:25:46,866 --> 02:25:48,400
You have done more
than a father would..

1775
02:25:48,466 --> 02:25:50,401
..but you should now give this..

1776
02:25:50,466 --> 02:25:52,935
..son of yours the
chance to execute my duty.

1777
02:26:00,366 --> 02:26:01,600
Give me the chance, Accountant.

1778
02:26:03,733 --> 02:26:04,867
Give me the chance.

1779
02:26:07,966 --> 02:26:09,634
Give me the chance.

1780
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:13,434
Give me the chance.

1781
02:26:57,366 --> 02:26:58,467
No, Accountant..

1782
02:27:01,866 --> 02:27:02,933
No!

1783
02:27:06,266 --> 02:27:07,333
No!

1784
02:27:08,733 --> 02:27:10,901
Don't leave me alone.

1785
02:27:14,700 --> 02:27:16,368
Come back, Accountant.

1786
02:27:19,299 --> 02:27:20,734
Come back, Accountant.

1787
02:27:22,700 --> 02:27:26,470
Don't go. l will never
ask you for anything again.

1788
02:27:28,266 --> 02:27:32,737
Don't make me an orphan.

1789
02:27:35,299 --> 02:27:38,770
Come back.. come back.

1790
02:27:39,799 --> 02:27:41,768
Come back, Accountant.

1791
02:27:42,500 --> 02:27:44,535
Come back, Accountant.

1792
02:28:00,533 --> 02:28:02,902
Vicky? You?

1793
02:28:05,366 --> 02:28:07,401
Mr. Rai Amarnath Kapoor..

1794
02:28:09,366 --> 02:28:10,834
Vicky has become an orphan today.

1795
02:28:12,799 --> 02:28:14,935
l have lost the
shelter of my father today.

1796
02:28:18,333 --> 02:28:19,834
My father has died today.

1797
02:28:20,633 --> 02:28:22,201
Looks like you have
started drinking cheap liquor..

1798
02:28:22,233 --> 02:28:24,535
..that's why you're
not in your senses.

1799
02:28:24,866 --> 02:28:26,734
Your father is standing before you.

1800
02:28:29,266 --> 02:28:35,338
This is the wealthy person who
merely gave birth to his son.

1801
02:28:36,866 --> 02:28:40,436
And dumped him like a fake
coin which is of no use.

1802
02:28:42,600 --> 02:28:46,203
But the one who brought up that
fake coin with his own hands..

1803
02:28:46,266 --> 02:28:49,202
..the one who served
you all his life..

1804
02:28:49,266 --> 02:28:52,369
..your one-time poor friend,
Accountant Phoolchand.

1805
02:28:56,133 --> 02:28:59,236
Accountant Phoolchand is no more.
- What?

1806
02:29:01,399 --> 02:29:02,467
Yes, Mr. Rai.

1807
02:29:04,633 --> 02:29:08,136
l have just come to ask you if..

1808
02:29:08,200 --> 02:29:15,407
..you have some time to spare
to participate in his funeral.

1809
02:29:16,600 --> 02:29:19,202
Or even today you are in the
midst of a meeting worth crores?

1810
02:29:19,266 --> 02:29:22,836
The thing is, at this
time, the election..

1811
02:29:23,233 --> 02:29:24,300
l understand.

1812
02:29:28,633 --> 02:29:29,667
You are helpless.

1813
02:29:32,200 --> 02:29:34,802
Your shoulders are
burdened with wealth right now.

1814
02:29:34,866 --> 02:29:37,201
Your shoulders are not
available to lift the corpse.

1815
02:29:38,733 --> 02:29:42,536
lt doesn't matter. l will
gather four people from somewhere.

1816
02:29:43,233 --> 02:29:45,501
And if l don't find them,
l will lift him on my own.

1817
02:29:46,600 --> 02:29:50,270
Accountant has lifted
me in his lap for years.

1818
02:29:50,333 --> 02:29:52,668
Then can l not lift him
in my hands for a day?

1819
02:29:55,133 --> 02:30:01,572
But before leaving, l would
surely want to tell you this.

1820
02:30:03,500 --> 02:30:05,268
Today, not one, but
two people have died.

1821
02:30:07,133 --> 02:30:09,201
For me, my father has died.
For you, your son has died.

1822
02:30:10,766 --> 02:30:13,335
We have become alone in
the world of relationships.

1823
02:30:14,233 --> 02:30:15,801
Everybody is destined to die some day.

1824
02:30:16,766 --> 02:30:20,369
Today, Accountant has died. l will
die. You will die too.

1825
02:30:21,466 --> 02:30:23,134
But the day you die..

1826
02:30:23,633 --> 02:30:26,402
..your son won't go to
perform the last rites.

1827
02:30:27,666 --> 02:30:30,068
Because after lighting
up Accountant's pyre..

1828
02:30:30,133 --> 02:30:33,769
..your right will be
burnt to ashes in that fire.

1829
02:30:43,299 --> 02:30:46,169
Mr. Kapoor, so shall we
start the meeting now?

1830
02:30:50,566 --> 02:30:54,102
Please leave me alone for a while.

1831
02:31:01,066 --> 02:31:02,133
Mr. Saxena..

1832
02:31:05,633 --> 02:31:06,734
All of you, please leave.

1833
02:31:08,299 --> 02:31:11,336
l want to stay alone
with Accountant for a while.

1834
02:31:12,299 --> 02:31:13,367
Let's go.

1835
02:31:43,033 --> 02:31:44,200
Good morning, Vicky.

1836
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:56,169
Sir.. Mr. Vicky is..

1837
02:31:56,933 --> 02:31:59,468
Yes.. Iet's proceed.

1838
02:32:03,166 --> 02:32:04,233
Yes, sir..

1839
02:32:04,533 --> 02:32:07,269
You want Meena to be
removed from Vicky's life..

1840
02:32:07,333 --> 02:32:09,401
..and your daughter to be
married to Vicky. Right?

1841
02:32:09,633 --> 02:32:12,268
Right.
- But what do l stand to gain?

1842
02:32:13,266 --> 02:32:17,169
l can do anything
for my only daughter.

1843
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,135
l won't let your drama company sink.

1844
02:32:20,200 --> 02:32:22,001
ln addition, l will give
you half-a-million in cash.

1845
02:32:22,399 --> 02:32:25,269
250,OOO in advance. And the
balance after the work is done.

1846
02:32:25,333 --> 02:32:29,437
Sir, l am an artiste. l can do an
ything for my drama company.

1847
02:32:29,500 --> 02:32:32,369
Consider your job done.
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

1848
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:34,067
Don't you worry.

1849
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:39,537
Listen.. first you got me behind bars
while selling the necklace.

1850
02:32:39,600 --> 02:32:41,168
Who are you sending to
the gallows this time?

1851
02:32:41,233 --> 02:32:44,002
Fool, you can never become
an artiste all your life.

1852
02:32:44,066 --> 02:32:47,969
My mind is a powerhouse. Remember
the night outside the hospital?

1853
02:32:48,233 --> 02:32:49,934
The butcher who was prepared
to set the hospital on fire..

1854
02:32:49,966 --> 02:32:52,001
..for the sake of his child.

1855
02:32:52,066 --> 02:32:53,400
He was on the verge of
killing all the doctors.

1856
02:32:53,466 --> 02:32:55,601
Can he not do our small job
for the sake of his child?

1857
02:32:58,533 --> 02:32:59,634
Listen..
- Yes?

1858
02:33:00,233 --> 02:33:03,603
l am feeling scared. Our son
has not returned from school yet.

1859
02:33:03,666 --> 02:33:05,534
Neither will he return now.
- What?

1860
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,268
Crooks have taken away your son.
- What did you say, idiot?

1861
02:33:08,333 --> 02:33:09,967
My son has been taken away by crooks?

1862
02:33:10,033 --> 02:33:11,434
l'll kill all the crooks in the city!

1863
02:33:11,600 --> 02:33:14,502
What's the use of using
force on an artiste like me?

1864
02:33:14,566 --> 02:33:16,401
l have come only to pass
on their message to you.

1865
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:19,936
The kidnappers have
threatened to kill me too.

1866
02:33:20,966 --> 02:33:22,934
They have said that if l
don't pass their message to you..

1867
02:33:22,966 --> 02:33:25,468
..they will kill me
and feed me to the dogs.

1868
02:33:26,166 --> 02:33:28,935
What else did they say?
- In return for your child's life..

1869
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:32,436
..you will have to kill Meena,
the famous stage dancer.

1870
02:33:32,500 --> 02:33:34,001
No! No!

1871
02:33:34,533 --> 02:33:39,004
l cannot commit a murder. l
have never killed any human being.

1872
02:33:39,066 --> 02:33:41,535
lf you haven't, chop her off
thinking her to be a sheep.

1873
02:33:41,600 --> 02:33:44,002
Commit one murder. Save my life.

1874
02:33:44,066 --> 02:33:46,034
Along with my life,
your son's life.. No.

1875
02:33:46,399 --> 02:33:48,535
Don't say that.

1876
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:52,269
l can commit even a thousand
murders for my son's life.

1877
02:33:52,299 --> 02:33:55,870
But remember.. if
something happens to my child..

1878
02:33:55,899 --> 02:34:01,171
..l will kill you too. l will
burn you alive. Understand? - Yes.

1879
02:34:04,566 --> 02:34:07,869
Looking at you, l
remembered the story of the King..

1880
02:34:07,933 --> 02:34:11,069
..who had been blessed that all
that he touches will turn to gold.

1881
02:34:16,433 --> 02:34:18,868
Ever since l can remember..

1882
02:34:18,933 --> 02:34:23,971
..l don't recollect that you
ever called me except for business.

1883
02:34:25,899 --> 02:34:27,001
Did you?

1884
02:34:52,433 --> 02:34:54,802
This man standing before me..

1885
02:34:54,866 --> 02:34:58,202
..is a wealthy person who
merely gave birth to his son.

1886
02:34:58,899 --> 02:35:02,303
And dumped him like a fake
coin which is of no use.

1887
02:35:06,466 --> 02:35:09,001
l was a stone-hearted person.

1888
02:35:09,966 --> 02:35:13,869
But separation from
you has melted my heart.

1889
02:35:15,933 --> 02:35:18,135
l am a broken man today.

1890
02:35:18,866 --> 02:35:20,200
l am broken man today.

1891
02:35:22,299 --> 02:35:26,437
These wealthy people use only
sticks made of gold and silver.

1892
02:35:26,833 --> 02:35:29,902
lt's against their status to
even touch a stick like me.

1893
02:35:34,433 --> 02:35:37,002
No, Accountant.. don't say so.

1894
02:35:38,066 --> 02:35:42,069
Having been blinded by wealth,
l had lost my senses.

1895
02:35:42,966 --> 02:35:44,801
Rai Amarnath Kapoor..

1896
02:35:44,866 --> 02:35:47,969
..who considered his
friend a servant is dead today.

1897
02:35:48,799 --> 02:35:49,867
Dead today.

1898
02:35:49,933 --> 02:35:52,268
Forgive me, Accountant.

1899
02:35:53,266 --> 02:35:54,433
Forgive me.

1900
02:35:55,166 --> 02:35:58,235
Not one but two people have died.
For me, my father has died.

1901
02:35:58,299 --> 02:35:59,467
For you, your son has died.

1902
02:36:00,366 --> 02:36:02,835
We have become alone in
the world of relationships.

1903
02:36:03,866 --> 02:36:06,735
Yes, daddy, you have given
me everything that can be..

1904
02:36:06,766 --> 02:36:09,235
..bought from the market
and decorated in the home.

1905
02:36:09,766 --> 02:36:11,734
But you have never
given me the bliss..

1906
02:36:11,799 --> 02:36:13,134
..that can be decorated in the heart.

1907
02:36:45,066 --> 02:36:48,436
You like liquor, don't
you? See for yourself..

1908
02:36:49,100 --> 02:36:52,937
Your father, who hated
liquor all his life..

1909
02:36:53,733 --> 02:36:55,367
He is drinking like a fish today.

1910
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:08,067
Cheers, Vicky.

1911
02:37:10,666 --> 02:37:12,167
Won't you do cheers with your father?

1912
02:37:12,200 --> 02:37:13,401
Cheers.

1913
02:37:17,299 --> 02:37:21,671
Today, for the first time,
l have realised..

1914
02:37:21,733 --> 02:37:26,070
..l'm also a human being..
that l am a father.

1915
02:37:27,700 --> 02:37:31,670
Come back, my son. Come back.

1916
02:37:32,933 --> 02:37:37,003
lf Accountant were alive today,
he would've brought you back.

1917
02:37:38,166 --> 02:37:42,670
Today, l will give my
wealth to the person..

1918
02:37:42,733 --> 02:37:45,702
..who can get me my son back to me.

1919
02:37:45,966 --> 02:37:47,767
Bring back my son to me.

1920
02:37:48,166 --> 02:37:50,167
Mr. Kapoor..
- Mr. Kapoor.

1921
02:37:50,666 --> 02:37:52,200
Who is it?
- Mr. Kapoor..

1922
02:37:52,266 --> 02:37:57,004
We have come to take you to your son.
- To my son? Where is Vicky?

1923
02:37:57,066 --> 02:37:59,601
At Mr. Govardhan's place. He
says that he won't return..

1924
02:37:59,666 --> 02:38:01,768
..till his daddy comes to fetch him.

1925
02:38:02,233 --> 02:38:04,001
l will personally go to bring him.

1926
02:38:04,266 --> 02:38:07,002
l will beg of him
and ask him for pardon.

1927
02:38:07,066 --> 02:38:09,034
Then l will hold his
finger and bring him back.

1928
02:38:09,600 --> 02:38:11,101
You too should scold him.
- Absolutely.

1929
02:38:11,166 --> 02:38:14,068
He has no right to be angry at
his father and go away like this.

1930
02:38:14,133 --> 02:38:15,200
Yes..
- Sure.

1931
02:38:15,266 --> 02:38:16,333
You should scold him.
- Yes, of course. - Come, Come.

1932
02:38:16,600 --> 02:38:19,235
Come, let's go.

1933
02:38:24,133 --> 02:38:25,868
You want evidence,
don't you? Come inside.

1934
02:38:26,600 --> 02:38:29,002
There's the evidence.

1935
02:38:33,666 --> 02:38:34,733
Look!

1936
02:38:35,266 --> 02:38:37,267
Have you seen the evidence?
Where is my son?

1937
02:38:37,766 --> 02:38:42,670
Get me my son. Otherwise, l
will kill Natwar Shah too.

1938
02:38:42,733 --> 02:38:44,668
Where's my son?
- You will get him.

1939
02:38:44,733 --> 02:38:46,234
l want my son immediately.

1940
02:38:46,299 --> 02:38:48,001
Shamsher.
- Here it is.

1941
02:38:48,266 --> 02:38:50,267
Give him his son.
- My son! - Father!

1942
02:38:50,333 --> 02:38:51,667
My son!
- Father!

1943
02:38:51,766 --> 02:38:52,933
My son!
- Father!

1944
02:38:54,566 --> 02:38:58,002
Tell me, what should
be done of this corpse?

1945
02:38:58,533 --> 02:39:02,803
Should l burn or bury it?
- Whatever. My work has been done.

1946
02:39:02,899 --> 02:39:05,569
l will convey this
good news to Natwar Shah.

1947
02:39:07,600 --> 02:39:10,269
Now l will extract a lot
of money from Natwar Shah.

1948
02:39:19,633 --> 02:39:20,700
Mr. Vicky!

1949
02:39:21,866 --> 02:39:24,168
Mr. Vicky! Mr. Vicky!

1950
02:39:28,566 --> 02:39:29,633
Mr. Vicky!

1951
02:39:29,733 --> 02:39:30,800
Miss Meena has been murdered!

1952
02:39:35,700 --> 02:39:36,801
Murder?

1953
02:39:38,633 --> 02:39:41,268
Who murdered her?
- l don't know that.

1954
02:39:41,833 --> 02:39:44,569
But some people were
taking Natwar Shah's name.

1955
02:39:46,166 --> 02:39:47,233
Miss Meena's clothes.

1956
02:39:57,600 --> 02:39:59,802
Listen to me, Mr. Vicky.
What wrong have l done?

1957
02:40:04,533 --> 02:40:06,568
Brother, l am an artiste.

1958
02:40:12,066 --> 02:40:13,133
Help!

1959
02:40:13,200 --> 02:40:14,534
l'm an artiste!

1960
02:40:14,600 --> 02:40:15,667
Somebody help me please!

1961
02:40:37,533 --> 02:40:40,869
My neck!

1962
02:40:44,100 --> 02:40:45,601
Tell me, why did you kill Meena?

1963
02:40:45,666 --> 02:40:47,734
Tell me, why did you kill Meena?

1964
02:40:47,799 --> 02:40:48,867
What wrong have l done?

1965
02:40:48,933 --> 02:40:50,000
Tell me!

1966
02:40:50,066 --> 02:40:51,066
Tell me!

1967
02:40:53,733 --> 02:40:56,469
Tell me.

1968
02:40:57,533 --> 02:41:01,837
l didn't kill Meena.
Abdul, the butcher killed her.

1969
02:41:01,899 --> 02:41:04,636
And it was Mr. Govardhan
who paid him to kill her.

1970
02:41:05,500 --> 02:41:08,703
l'm telling you the truth. Believe me.

1971
02:41:12,066 --> 02:41:13,133
Mr. Vicky!

1972
02:41:15,466 --> 02:41:18,802
You are here? How strange!

1973
02:41:18,866 --> 02:41:21,668
Those people took away Mr. Kapoor to
meet you at Mr. Govardhan's place.

1974
02:41:21,733 --> 02:41:23,901
Who?
- Your daddy's business partners.

1975
02:41:23,966 --> 02:41:29,638
You know very well that l no
Ionger have any relation with him now.

1976
02:41:29,700 --> 02:41:32,702
Blood relations
cannot be cut off easily.

1977
02:41:32,766 --> 02:41:34,601
You have been born in this
world because of Mr. Kapoor.

1978
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:37,936
lf not being his blood relation,
save him in the name of humanity.

1979
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:40,602
Because grieving for you, he
has started drinking liquor!

1980
02:41:42,933 --> 02:41:45,101
What are you saying?
- Yes, Mr. Vicky.

1981
02:41:46,633 --> 02:41:47,900
Daddy has started drinking liquor?

1982
02:41:52,766 --> 02:41:55,935
Mr. Kapoor, this is the last document.

1983
02:42:07,633 --> 02:42:10,535
Here, Govardhan. l have
signed all the documents.

1984
02:42:10,933 --> 02:42:17,539
Now let me meet my son. l'm
yearning to embrace him once.

1985
02:42:17,666 --> 02:42:22,070
Not once, but you may
embrace him a thousand times.

1986
02:42:22,666 --> 02:42:25,068
But not here.. after you go up above.

1987
02:42:25,399 --> 02:42:29,937
Up above? Is Vicky up there?
Why didn't you tell me before?

1988
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:32,335
Move away..
- If Mr. Kapoor is in such hurry..

1989
02:42:32,399 --> 02:42:36,003
..to go up above, why delay?

1990
02:42:36,066 --> 02:42:40,336
Make him go so high that he
cannot come back on the earth..

1991
02:42:40,399 --> 02:42:44,937
..and claim that we had made
him sign the documents forcibly.

1992
02:42:44,966 --> 02:42:46,067
What say?

1993
02:42:46,566 --> 02:42:47,833
Take him away!

1994
02:42:50,700 --> 02:42:51,767
Take him away!

1995
02:42:52,366 --> 02:42:54,835
Govardhan! Idiot!

1996
02:42:55,366 --> 02:43:01,472
Today, l got separated
from my son because of you!

1997
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:08,335
lt's you, Vicky?
- The one who can kill my father..

1998
02:43:08,399 --> 02:43:10,635
..is yet to be born, Govardhan!

1999
02:43:11,433 --> 02:43:14,402
l have disassociated from
his wealth, not from his life.

2000
02:43:16,966 --> 02:43:18,967
What are you looking at! Beat him!

2001
02:43:19,066 --> 02:43:20,967
My daughter is in the
hospital because of him.

2002
02:43:21,033 --> 02:43:22,834
Hit him! Hit the fool!

2003
02:44:06,733 --> 02:44:07,934
ldiot!

2004
02:44:12,700 --> 02:44:13,801
Run for you lives.

2005
02:44:17,366 --> 02:44:21,670
Wait, friends. Come..
- Come.

2006
02:44:21,733 --> 02:44:23,801
Come on, hurry up.

2007
02:44:25,500 --> 02:44:31,806
Fools! How will the car start if th
e engine is lying here?

2008
02:44:31,933 --> 02:44:36,003
l see. - In a short while,
your Natwar too will come out.

2009
02:44:36,399 --> 02:44:39,736
Mr. Saxena, Mr. Vicky
doesn't say for nothing..

2010
02:44:39,799 --> 02:44:42,602
A moustache should be..
- Like that of Mr. Nathulal.

2011
02:44:42,833 --> 02:44:45,535
Now how should they be dealt with?

2012
02:44:45,600 --> 02:44:47,935
Just like they should be dealt with.
- Alright.

2013
02:44:57,633 --> 02:45:02,704
Beat him, son! Harder!

2014
02:45:06,600 --> 02:45:09,402
Beat the idiot!
- Where is everyone?

2015
02:45:09,466 --> 02:45:10,767
Grab the file from him.

2016
02:45:14,899 --> 02:45:16,201
Let go of me! Please!

2017
02:45:30,733 --> 02:45:32,835
Where are you running?

2018
02:45:49,666 --> 02:45:52,402
He will die laughing.

2019
02:46:01,799 --> 02:46:05,170
Vicky.. my son.. my son!

2020
02:46:07,133 --> 02:46:09,335
How dare you cause me harm!

2021
02:46:10,366 --> 02:46:12,701
This doesn't contain
rotten eggs and oranges.

2022
02:46:13,200 --> 02:46:15,769
lt contains bullets.
That too real ones!

2023
02:46:22,799 --> 02:46:26,537
Beware! l will shoot you dead!

2024
02:46:26,600 --> 02:46:29,803
No, Inspector. Don't do that!

2025
02:46:30,566 --> 02:46:33,468
As it is, they are dead.
Why blemish your uniform?

2026
02:46:33,533 --> 02:46:36,869
Mr. Vicky, this uniform too has
been made possible because of you.

2027
02:46:37,466 --> 02:46:40,168
l will sacrifice it
today for your sake.

2028
02:46:40,766 --> 02:46:42,634
ldiot!
- Anwar, don't!

2029
02:46:45,399 --> 02:46:47,869
Constable, take away these fools!

2030
02:46:55,766 --> 02:47:01,204
Where to, mister? l have yet
to deal with you. Come on.

2031
02:47:01,366 --> 02:47:02,667
l'm a respectable person!
- Move!

2032
02:47:03,133 --> 02:47:06,769
Vicky.. my son.. my son..

2033
02:47:08,700 --> 02:47:11,602
You have been very late
in recognising your son.

2034
02:47:13,100 --> 02:47:16,069
For me, all my life,
you were like a picture..

2035
02:47:16,100 --> 02:47:19,069
..which was framed all around
with frame of gold and silver..

2036
02:47:19,133 --> 02:47:22,135
..and which had a
glass of wealth in between.

2037
02:47:22,466 --> 02:47:24,768
We never happened to meet.

2038
02:47:25,133 --> 02:47:28,269
No, son. That glass of
wealth has been shattered now.

2039
02:47:28,666 --> 02:47:30,334
l'm also shattered now.

2040
02:47:31,066 --> 02:47:32,200
l'm also shattered now.

2041
02:47:32,399 --> 02:47:35,669
Here is your property.

2042
02:47:36,733 --> 02:47:40,269
Now.. l don't want to live. No..

2043
02:47:40,333 --> 02:47:43,235
Don't say that, son. You will live.

2044
02:47:43,666 --> 02:47:47,102
You will live for me. You
will live for your father.

2045
02:47:47,366 --> 02:47:53,171
No, daddy. Accountant is
no more. Meena too is gone.

2046
02:47:53,466 --> 02:47:56,402
For whom should l live?

2047
02:47:57,266 --> 02:48:00,402
Mr. Vicky.. Miss Meena is right here!

2048
02:48:01,466 --> 02:48:05,736
Vicky! Vicky!

2049
02:48:07,666 --> 02:48:14,205
Mr. Vicky, l am sorry for having
pretended to have killed Meena.

2050
02:48:15,333 --> 02:48:21,238
You had saved my son's life. Then
how could l take away your life?

2051
02:48:22,033 --> 02:48:26,103
l'm a butcher. But l
am not an executioner.

2052
02:48:29,066 --> 02:48:30,133
Meena..

2053
02:48:30,200 --> 02:48:32,735
Son, you will live now, won't you?

2054
02:48:33,500 --> 02:48:37,270
lf not for me, for my
daughter-in-law's sake.

2055
02:48:39,066 --> 02:48:40,133
Yes, daddy.

2056
02:48:44,066 --> 02:48:52,073
''We are disciples of love..

2057
02:48:52,533 --> 02:48:57,004
..wish everyone's prosperity.''

2058
02:48:57,533 --> 02:49:03,939
''Everyone are my friends..

2059
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:10,339
..and no enemies.''
