1
00:00:47,497 --> 00:00:51,340
<i>A hundred years ago, the Britishers</i>
<i>called me Cawnpore.</i>

2
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,794
<i>The Manchester of India.</i>

3
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,919
<i>People would die</i>
<i>to come here.</i>

4
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,745
<i>After Independence though</i>

5
00:01:00,817 --> 00:01:04,020
<i>the English ways made way</i>
<i>for the not-so-English.</i>

6
00:01:05,105 --> 00:01:08,323
<i>And from Cawnpore,</i>
<i>I became Kanpur.</i>

7
00:01:08,518 --> 00:01:10,564
<i>The city roads are puzzling</i>

8
00:01:10,621 --> 00:01:13,082
<i>and so are the minds of the people here.</i>

9
00:01:13,191 --> 00:01:14,979
<i>It's a city of madcaps.</i>

10
00:01:15,419 --> 00:01:19,536
<i>In fact, I am now the national capital</i>
<i>of wackos.</i>

11
00:01:20,075 --> 00:01:22,490
<i>After all these years,</i>
<i>nothing is the same anymore.</i>

12
00:01:22,607 --> 00:01:24,138
<i>No one is eager to come here anymore.</i>

13
00:01:24,244 --> 00:01:26,260
<i>They are rather in a rush</i>
<i>to leave this place.</i>

14
00:01:27,238 --> 00:01:31,363
<i>Since we are talking about it,</i>
<i>let me amuse you with a story.</i>

15
00:01:33,004 --> 00:01:34,921
<i>It's actually a story</i>

16
00:01:35,038 --> 00:01:36,996
<i>having three heroes.</i>

17
00:01:37,095 --> 00:01:39,126
<i>And watch out!</i>

18
00:01:39,311 --> 00:01:42,477
<i>Here comes our first hero.</i>

19
00:01:45,713 --> 00:01:47,596
Hey, man! Watch where you spit!

20
00:01:47,645 --> 00:01:48,517
CLEAN INDIA
ONE STEP TOWARDS CLEANLINESS

21
00:01:48,562 --> 00:01:50,148
Why don't you watch where you halt?

22
00:01:50,687 --> 00:01:52,359
It's a pain to even argue with you.

23
00:01:52,395 --> 00:01:53,650
DAYANAND ANGLO VEDIC COLLEGE
KANPUR

24
00:01:54,187 --> 00:01:56,366
Students, I hope you know that

25
00:01:56,603 --> 00:01:58,645
cooking vegetables on a low heat

26
00:01:58,808 --> 00:02:01,617
ensures that their iron content
remains intact.

27
00:02:01,842 --> 00:02:04,342
Just like... Whose phone is ringing?

28
00:02:05,228 --> 00:02:08,939
Don't you know that
you can't use your phone in college?

29
00:02:09,384 --> 00:02:10,556
Give me your phone.

30
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,885
Is your tap really that faulty?

31
00:02:20,995 --> 00:02:23,620
<i>Where are you?</i>
<i>I have been waiting for half an hour.</i>

32
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:25,884
<i>Are you interested in home science</i>
<i>more than me?</i>

33
00:02:25,986 --> 00:02:29,283
Hey, Mr. Plumber.
Please hold on for another ten minutes.

34
00:02:29,572 --> 00:02:31,994
Your customer's class
is about to get over.

35
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:38,190
Do I look like a plumber to you?

36
00:02:38,322 --> 00:02:39,908
You could have saved my
name as "Hrithik Roshan."

37
00:02:40,565 --> 00:02:42,642
What if Dad comes to know about us?

38
00:02:42,677 --> 00:02:44,510
If he does,
he'll make sure we break up.

39
00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:45,768
You are such a fool.

40
00:02:46,057 --> 00:02:47,080
Yes, I am!

41
00:02:47,105 --> 00:02:49,401
I'm a fool for you!
I'm madly in love with you.

42
00:02:50,768 --> 00:02:52,495
I told you that today is special.

43
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,864
I took a half-day leave from work.

44
00:02:54,706 --> 00:02:57,507
I tend to lose my mind over you,
and your home science doesn't help.

45
00:03:01,797 --> 00:03:03,296
I see.

46
00:03:05,342 --> 00:03:10,443
<i>We roam around the streets</i>
<i>Like carefree lovebirds</i>

47
00:03:10,467 --> 00:03:15,177
<i>I spend all my time with you</i>
<i>So that I can express my love to you</i>

48
00:03:15,259 --> 00:03:20,357
<i>Neither you nor I</i>
<i>Can deny the will of the heart</i>

49
00:03:20,592 --> 00:03:25,089
<i>When you are in love</i>
<i>Nothing else matters</i>

50
00:03:25,155 --> 00:03:27,592
<i>I praise you, I praise you</i>

51
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:30,174
<i>I praise you, my crazy little heart</i>

52
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,681
<i>I praise you, I praise you</i>

53
00:03:32,775 --> 00:03:35,283
<i>I praise you, my crazy little heart</i>

54
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:37,263
<i>I praise you</i>

55
00:03:45,093 --> 00:03:46,953
Why have you got me here?

56
00:03:52,118 --> 00:03:53,756
What are you doing?
Don't ruin your trousers.

57
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,730
Just hold this for a second.

58
00:03:58,956 --> 00:04:00,831
Give it back to me.
Can I say it now?

59
00:04:03,841 --> 00:04:06,466
I can bring you stars and the moon.

60
00:04:07,728 --> 00:04:09,767
I can move mountains for you.

61
00:04:10,775 --> 00:04:12,493
You are the most important to me.

62
00:04:12,947 --> 00:04:14,338
You are the love of my life.

63
00:04:16,838 --> 00:04:17,907
Yuck!

64
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:22,251
Why don't you shit on my love?

65
00:04:22,306 --> 00:04:25,033
Why don't you rent a room instead?

66
00:04:25,716 --> 00:04:27,842
It would just be Rs. 200 an hour.

67
00:04:27,884 --> 00:04:29,092
Why don't I slap you instead?

68
00:04:29,092 --> 00:04:30,772
To heck with you!

69
00:04:37,298 --> 00:04:39,641
Bulbul, please listen to me.

70
00:04:39,775 --> 00:04:43,009
Everyone thinks that I'm an idiot
and you are way out of my league.

71
00:04:43,425 --> 00:04:45,023
But I'll get married only to you.

72
00:04:45,134 --> 00:04:47,759
Ours will be Kanpur's
number one love story.

73
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:49,540
Will you be my best half?

74
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,142
-No.
-Why not?

75
00:04:53,175 --> 00:04:55,761
You spend your entire day with me.
Then, why won't you agree?

76
00:04:55,967 --> 00:04:57,467
-No.
-Hold this.

77
00:04:57,509 --> 00:04:58,759
Forget about them!

78
00:04:59,092 --> 00:05:01,069
Let them take a dump out there.

79
00:05:01,119 --> 00:05:02,127
Take this.

80
00:05:03,923 --> 00:05:05,407
I've got a ring for you.

81
00:05:06,671 --> 00:05:07,734
No, Jaitun.

82
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:10,728
Why not?

83
00:05:11,119 --> 00:05:12,494
No! No! No!

84
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,751
Do you use Snapchat?

85
00:05:24,345 --> 00:05:25,338
No, sir.

86
00:05:28,298 --> 00:05:29,978
Jaitun Mishra.

87
00:05:30,548 --> 00:05:31,580
What does your name mean?

88
00:05:32,126 --> 00:05:36,180
It's green in colour and is
known as olives in English.

89
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,276
-We get Vitamin E from it.
-Oh, wow!

90
00:05:39,571 --> 00:05:42,486
Is that why both of you were
exchanging vitamins out there?

91
00:05:42,877 --> 00:05:44,634
Sir, I was going to propose to her.

92
00:05:45,587 --> 00:05:46,782
Why don't you show it to me?

93
00:05:47,486 --> 00:05:48,541
How do you propose?

94
00:05:49,681 --> 00:05:50,938
But you are a man.

95
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:54,943
In Mumbai, men propose to each other.

96
00:05:57,494 --> 00:06:03,095
All you young Romeos just want
to have fun before marriage.

97
00:06:03,217 --> 00:06:05,300
Sir, mind your words!
We are serious about each other.

98
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,570
You scumbag!

99
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,219
Don't act too smart!

100
00:06:10,925 --> 00:06:15,057
I am way smarter than you.
Get me?

101
00:06:18,088 --> 00:06:19,627
-Babulal.
-Yes, sir?

102
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,425
Hit him between the legs
and teach him a lesson.

103
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:26,195
Contact the girl's parents.

104
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:28,592
Why do you want to call them?
We can sort it right here.

105
00:06:28,614 --> 00:06:30,592
I'll squat in this position
for an hour.

106
00:06:30,676 --> 00:06:33,176
How does that matter to us?

107
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:35,157
Sir likes eating pizza.

108
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,783
Let us order some pizzas.

109
00:06:36,884 --> 00:06:37,954
Will you guys have some?

110
00:06:38,178 --> 00:06:39,014
PRISON FOR MEN

111
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:41,998
Shall I order cheese burst pizza?

112
00:06:44,181 --> 00:06:46,454
Let's have some pizza before we leave.

113
00:06:47,923 --> 00:06:49,033
Nonsense!

114
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:50,847
I thought you must be hungry.

115
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,571
Can I say something?

116
00:06:56,798 --> 00:06:58,345
Dad will be very happy.

117
00:06:59,467 --> 00:07:02,353
He will be blessed
with a caring daughter-in-law.

118
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,582
Is your special day over?

119
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:06,616
"I can move mountains for you."

120
00:07:08,572 --> 00:07:10,002
Come along if you want,
but I am leaving.

121
00:07:18,687 --> 00:07:20,607
LAMPAT HARAMI AND COMPANY

122
00:07:26,017 --> 00:07:28,657
Harami! Harami!

123
00:07:28,724 --> 00:07:32,224
<i>You must be thinking that</i>
<i>he is the second hero.</i>

124
00:07:32,592 --> 00:07:33,467
<i>But no.</i>

125
00:07:33,478 --> 00:07:34,322
<i>That's wrong.</i>

126
00:07:34,384 --> 00:07:38,717
Greetings to the big-hearted
and the stingy people as well!

127
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,611
<i>He is not the hero.</i>

128
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:44,728
<i>He is the villain to our second hero.</i>

129
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:49,916
<i>The baddie. The rascal.</i>
<i>In short, the Godfather.</i>

130
00:07:50,384 --> 00:07:54,580
-How are you all?
-Awesome!

131
00:07:55,002 --> 00:07:59,043
I went to America two days ago.

132
00:07:59,592 --> 00:08:01,490
I ate quite a lot of meat.

133
00:08:01,978 --> 00:08:03,454
Here's what I asked the waiter.

134
00:08:03,556 --> 00:08:07,853
I asked him about the difference
in the prices for butter chicken.

135
00:08:08,314 --> 00:08:09,752
The rates were Rs. 100

136
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,103
Rs. 60 and Rs. 10 per plate
respectively.

137
00:08:12,447 --> 00:08:17,204
The chicken served at Rs. 10
had AIDS.

138
00:08:17,337 --> 00:08:19,587
I ordered five of it.

139
00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:23,345
After all, I didn't have to
make love to the chicken.

140
00:08:23,673 --> 00:08:25,416
That's right.

141
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:29,845
I can see some new faces.

142
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:32,235
The youth of the nation!

143
00:08:32,342 --> 00:08:34,209
But the youth create a dilemma.

144
00:08:34,509 --> 00:08:36,743
-They start seeing it every now and then.
-What?

145
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:39,798
-My son saw it last night.
-What?

146
00:08:39,884 --> 00:08:41,252
Dream!

147
00:08:41,345 --> 00:08:44,455
They dream way more
than they can ever achieve.

148
00:08:44,967 --> 00:08:47,475
If everyone becomes famous,

149
00:08:47,517 --> 00:08:49,384
-what will all the infamous people do?
-Right!

150
00:08:49,447 --> 00:08:51,030
So, I slapped him!

151
00:08:51,189 --> 00:08:52,650
And there went his dream.

152
00:08:55,455 --> 00:08:58,080
Let us talk about our city.

153
00:08:58,509 --> 00:08:59,805
Kanpur...

154
00:08:59,812 --> 00:09:02,490
We might be short of electricity,

155
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:04,954
but there is no shortage of garbage
at every nook and corner.

156
00:09:08,265 --> 00:09:10,124
That's why I like America.

157
00:09:10,601 --> 00:09:13,468
It is a neat and clean place.

158
00:09:13,664 --> 00:09:15,109
You can kiss on the roads

159
00:09:15,134 --> 00:09:18,345
as well as use guns out there.

160
00:09:18,842 --> 00:09:23,600
That's why I am leaving for America
with my lady love, Kohinoor.

161
00:09:23,636 --> 00:09:25,636
No! No! No!

162
00:09:25,678 --> 00:09:27,470
Kohinoor won't go anywhere.

163
00:09:27,492 --> 00:09:29,325
She belongs to me!

164
00:09:30,967 --> 00:09:36,296
Kohinoor, my darling,
your lover boy is sitting right here.

165
00:09:36,613 --> 00:09:37,488
Fine!

166
00:09:38,265 --> 00:09:40,851
The plan for America stands cancelled.

167
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:46,217
So, gentlemen, in Banaras,
just like we have the sweet <i>motichoor</i>

168
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:50,594
please welcome with kisses
the luscious Kohinoor!

169
00:09:50,636 --> 00:09:53,178
-Here she comes!
-Kohinoor!

170
00:10:13,953 --> 00:10:17,242
<i>It hurts a lot</i>

171
00:10:19,093 --> 00:10:22,038
<i>In my heart</i>

172
00:10:24,234 --> 00:10:26,656
<i>It hurts a lot</i>

173
00:10:26,842 --> 00:10:29,100
<i>In my heart</i>

174
00:10:29,765 --> 00:10:32,320
<i>I am like a sweet poison</i>

175
00:10:32,429 --> 00:10:34,835
<i>I can bring down hell on you</i>

176
00:10:34,913 --> 00:10:37,554
<i>I am like a sweet poison</i>

177
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,201
<i>I can bring down hell on you</i>

178
00:10:40,343 --> 00:10:42,015
<i>I don't believe in wooing</i>

179
00:10:42,092 --> 00:10:45,249
<i>I believe in authentic love</i>

180
00:10:45,359 --> 00:10:47,109
<i>I don't believe in wooing</i>

181
00:10:47,176 --> 00:10:50,191
<i>I believe in authentic love</i>

182
00:10:50,265 --> 00:10:53,307
<i>Take my life...</i>

183
00:11:01,499 --> 00:11:02,867
Golu.

184
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:05,530
Take this.

185
00:11:10,827 --> 00:11:12,499
When did you prepare chicken?

186
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,480
Couldn't you give it to me earlier?

187
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,033
Jugnu prepared it.

188
00:11:27,564 --> 00:11:29,814
This is his recipe.

189
00:11:31,579 --> 00:11:33,259
There is a huge college in Mumbai.

190
00:11:34,056 --> 00:11:35,666
It's a two months' course.

191
00:11:36,675 --> 00:11:38,503
It will cost Rs. 50,000.

192
00:11:45,837 --> 00:11:47,337
You've started dreaming again!

193
00:11:47,736 --> 00:11:50,424
Didn't I ask you to stop cooking food?

194
00:11:51,074 --> 00:11:52,616
Where are the magazines I got you?

195
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:56,759
Yes...

196
00:11:58,203 --> 00:11:59,352
When will you read these?

197
00:11:59,425 --> 00:12:01,464
When will you read all this pulp?

198
00:12:05,189 --> 00:12:06,611
I am talking to you!

199
00:12:08,571 --> 00:12:11,462
My knee starts hurting
when I stand on the stage.

200
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:13,670
Why don't you do some filler acts?

201
00:12:14,213 --> 00:12:15,298
When will you do it?

202
00:12:17,088 --> 00:12:18,611
Your stage disgusts me.

203
00:12:18,931 --> 00:12:20,759
<i>Take my life</i>

204
00:12:20,822 --> 00:12:24,111
<i>My love is of the diabetic kind...</i>

205
00:12:27,275 --> 00:12:28,580
Listen to me.

206
00:12:29,267 --> 00:12:30,743
This too is a form of art.

207
00:12:31,134 --> 00:12:32,353
It's a kind of talent.

208
00:12:32,592 --> 00:12:33,975
I learnt it from my father.

209
00:12:34,092 --> 00:12:36,352
He learnt it from his father.
You can learn it from me.

210
00:12:37,072 --> 00:12:38,330
Do you want me to
show my talent

211
00:12:38,384 --> 00:12:39,923
in front of this riff-raff?

212
00:12:43,532 --> 00:12:44,806
What do you mean?

213
00:12:45,251 --> 00:12:48,212
Only rich people
have the right to be entertained?

214
00:12:48,842 --> 00:12:49,842
Not them?

215
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:52,892
<i>My love is of the diabetic kind</i>

216
00:12:52,963 --> 00:12:54,470
<i>Take my life</i>

217
00:12:54,548 --> 00:12:56,477
<i>My love is of the diabetic kind</i>

218
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:06,798
Even I am a stand-up comedian.

219
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:14,463
<i>Anyway, meet him.</i>

220
00:13:15,092 --> 00:13:19,147
<i>He is the third hero of our story.</i>

221
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:24,431
<i>And as unlucky as the other two.</i>

222
00:13:25,891 --> 00:13:27,808
<i>You might want to know why.</i>

223
00:13:28,877 --> 00:13:30,408
DISTRICT COURT, KANPUR

224
00:13:31,384 --> 00:13:36,462
<i>He is going to fight his first case</i>
<i>as a lawyer.</i>

225
00:13:37,142 --> 00:13:41,001
<i>And in this case, he is not just a lawyer,</i>
<i>but a criminal too.</i>

226
00:13:41,641 --> 00:13:42,558
<i>Did you get it? No?</i>

227
00:13:42,602 --> 00:13:44,303
SHANKAR SAXENA
DISTRICT COURT JUDGE – KANPUR

228
00:13:44,361 --> 00:13:45,321
<i>Let's go in.</i>

229
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:47,899
May I come in, sir?

230
00:13:49,431 --> 00:13:50,955
Are you coming in
for the first time?

231
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,517
Please come in.

232
00:14:01,345 --> 00:14:06,930
-Vijay Dinanath Chauhan.
-Yes, sir.

233
00:14:07,384 --> 00:14:08,915
Where is your lawyer?

234
00:14:09,259 --> 00:14:10,501
Who is the accused?

235
00:14:11,092 --> 00:14:12,522
Sir, it's me.

236
00:14:14,675 --> 00:14:18,457
It must be tough,
Mr. Vijay Dinanath Chauhan.

237
00:14:19,766 --> 00:14:22,399
Mr. Shukla, please proceed with the case.

238
00:14:27,095 --> 00:14:28,306
Hello!

239
00:14:29,923 --> 00:14:31,345
Good morning.

240
00:14:32,259 --> 00:14:34,259
I am sorry, sir.

241
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:37,839
I was at Lampat Harami's show
last night.

242
00:14:38,662 --> 00:14:40,236
I am ready.

243
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:42,996
Let's start.

244
00:14:43,626 --> 00:14:49,063
My client, Prem Kumari Parihar,
has mentioned in her complaint

245
00:14:49,926 --> 00:14:52,129
that Vijay Dinanath Chauhan

246
00:14:52,384 --> 00:14:56,001
tried to molest her and undress her

247
00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:00,765
in front of her father.

248
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:07,310
He should be subjected
to IPC Sections 294,

249
00:15:07,604 --> 00:15:09,521
299...

250
00:15:09,585 --> 00:15:15,054
and Sections 323, 504 and 506
for assaulting her.

251
00:15:16,233 --> 00:15:18,288
Would you like to say anything?

252
00:15:18,482 --> 00:15:20,467
Yes. Sir, he is full of rubbish.

253
00:15:21,101 --> 00:15:23,960
I mean, I am sorry, sir.
This is not the truth.

254
00:15:24,499 --> 00:15:25,662
It was a minor accident.

255
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:28,717
And it wasn't just my fault.

256
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:32,160
Hence, the mention of IPC Section 294...

257
00:15:32,186 --> 00:15:33,983
At least stand up while you talk.

258
00:15:34,386 --> 00:15:35,970
Yes. Sorry.

259
00:15:38,593 --> 00:15:39,702
Sorry, sir.

260
00:15:40,634 --> 00:15:43,009
According to Article 226,

261
00:15:43,134 --> 00:15:45,220
this is a false case.

262
00:15:46,507 --> 00:15:49,265
It is my humble appeal, sir,
that this case should be...

263
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,815
-quashed, sir.
-What?

264
00:15:54,592 --> 00:15:56,545
"Quashed." I mean it should be dismissed.

265
00:15:57,384 --> 00:15:59,454
Do not try teach me English.

266
00:15:59,538 --> 00:16:01,468
-No, sir.
-I would like to say that

267
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:04,985
Article 226...

268
00:16:06,286 --> 00:16:08,122
Article 226...

269
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,503
Sir, I'll tell you about it.

270
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,561
He used to be a script writer
for mythological TV shows.

271
00:16:12,592 --> 00:16:13,984
Only later, he became a lawyer.

272
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:16,056
I can guarantee it after listening
to all his bullshit since morning.

273
00:16:16,092 --> 00:16:18,859
-And he is a fool. Silly man!
-Hey, boy! What are you saying?

274
00:16:18,884 --> 00:16:21,486
-I am speaking the truth.
-What do you know about law?

275
00:16:21,509 --> 00:16:24,032
-How dare you say that?
-You're a fool...

276
00:16:24,134 --> 00:16:26,806
Don't you dare mess with me!

277
00:16:26,874 --> 00:16:30,601
Shut up the two of you! Keep quiet!

278
00:16:31,467 --> 00:16:33,217
How can you behave like this?

279
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:35,067
Your case will be shut

280
00:16:35,092 --> 00:16:36,795
if I put you both in jail.

281
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,538
-Vijay Dinanath Chauhan.
-Yes, sir?

282
00:16:41,975 --> 00:16:46,757
Please get some evidence or a witness
at the next hearing.

283
00:16:47,316 --> 00:16:49,108
-Okay, sir.
-Or else, you won't get a bail.

284
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,102
What?

285
00:16:56,446 --> 00:16:57,860
Sir.

286
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:00,251
Sir, this is my first case.

287
00:17:00,493 --> 00:17:02,141
Please be lenient.

288
00:17:02,214 --> 00:17:05,003
I am from your college...
2017 batch.

289
00:17:05,738 --> 00:17:06,738
Yes, sir.

290
00:17:07,934 --> 00:17:11,267
Are you here to fight your case
or for the college alumni meet?

291
00:17:20,152 --> 00:17:23,137
That was an awesome shot!

292
00:17:23,884 --> 00:17:25,431
What's his name?

293
00:17:25,509 --> 00:17:26,993
Pintu Pandey!

294
00:17:27,618 --> 00:17:31,220
Should I talk to Qasim and
make you a part of

295
00:17:31,474 --> 00:17:32,670
Kanpur CPL?

296
00:17:36,644 --> 00:17:38,660
Why such a long face, dude?

297
00:17:42,009 --> 00:17:45,300
The judge said that
my bail might be rejected.

298
00:17:47,504 --> 00:17:50,714
Weren't you about to join someone
by the name of... Dholie... Dhol...

299
00:17:50,879 --> 00:17:52,326
-Dholakia.
-Yes!

300
00:17:52,368 --> 00:17:53,691
I don't think I'll be able to join him.

301
00:17:54,634 --> 00:17:57,712
Tell me this. What is your problem staying here?

302
00:17:57,814 --> 00:18:00,603
Why don't you practice in your own city
and live life king size?

303
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,892
Really?

304
00:18:02,368 --> 00:18:04,110
Mumbai would be a different
ball game altogether.

305
00:18:04,135 --> 00:18:05,971
The people there are masterminds.

306
00:18:06,181 --> 00:18:08,040
It will be fun fighting a case there.

307
00:18:09,103 --> 00:18:11,980
Dawood Ibrahim's lawyer
might be so famous there!

308
00:18:13,113 --> 00:18:14,832
And look around here.

309
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,416
Here, all the oldies are running around
getting rent agreements made.

310
00:18:18,642 --> 00:18:20,812
But they leave their houses
wearing their black coats

311
00:18:20,837 --> 00:18:22,517
to show off for the entire world.

312
00:18:24,999 --> 00:18:27,003
I can't live such a shallow life.

313
00:18:29,811 --> 00:18:30,980
Did you talk to your father?

314
00:18:32,006 --> 00:18:34,272
Don't even talk about him.

315
00:18:34,297 --> 00:18:35,789
Being an Amitabh Bachchan fan,

316
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:37,738
he named me after one of his characters,

317
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,689
hoping that I would be getting
justice for everyone.

318
00:18:39,717 --> 00:18:41,925
And here I am, not getting it
even for myself.

319
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:46,993
Moreover, I am such a fool. I don't know
why I stopped asking for money from him.

320
00:18:49,057 --> 00:18:53,119
Vijay, the fact remains...
that till a point,

321
00:18:55,354 --> 00:18:56,355
father is money.

322
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:58,596
-Please don't.
-Keep it.

323
00:18:59,009 --> 00:18:59,899
Keep it.

324
00:19:02,369 --> 00:19:04,330
And then, money is father.

325
00:19:09,557 --> 00:19:11,463
-Peter?
-That's me.

326
00:19:12,479 --> 00:19:14,824
Kajal suited you better as a name though.

327
00:19:16,643 --> 00:19:17,986
I've come up with something new.

328
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,173
An English name carries
a certain weight here.

329
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:24,821
-Kumar Sanu is going to be performing.
-I see!

330
00:19:24,846 --> 00:19:27,429
-I've got an advance amount for it.
-That's great.

331
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:28,650
Listen to me.

332
00:19:28,675 --> 00:19:31,235
Why don't you talk to Mr. Sanu?

333
00:19:31,428 --> 00:19:34,261
When I go to Mumbai,
I will stay at his house.

334
00:19:34,886 --> 00:19:35,928
Why not?

335
00:19:35,947 --> 00:19:38,761
I am sure he must have
built a bungalow by now.

336
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,041
He does have a bungalow.

337
00:19:41,217 --> 00:19:43,772
But I think we should
speak to Mr. Bachchan instead.

338
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:45,166
We can get you a room in Jalsa.

339
00:19:45,175 --> 00:19:48,175
That's okay. His house floods
during the rains.

340
00:19:48,853 --> 00:19:52,061
<i>While Jaitun was getting</i>
<i>clobbered for his love,</i>

341
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:55,508
<i>Jugnu was getting slapped around</i>
<i>by his father for being a rebel.</i>

342
00:19:56,285 --> 00:20:00,702
<i>And our lawyer, poor Vijay Chauhan,</i>
<i>was getting lost in his own case.</i>

343
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:05,738
<i>In short, if ill fate had a face</i>
<i>these three were it.</i>

344
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:14,939
<i>Speaking of illness,</i>
<i>let's talk about the doctor as well.</i>

345
00:20:14,978 --> 00:20:16,744
MAGICAL CURES
MOHAN MISHRA

346
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:19,964
<i>Jaitun was madly in love.</i>

347
00:20:20,675 --> 00:20:22,613
<i>And his father, an Ayurvedic doctor,</i>

348
00:20:23,009 --> 00:20:26,040
<i>had a medicine for every kind of disease.</i>

349
00:20:34,394 --> 00:20:39,449
<i>I think his supply of medicines</i>
<i>is running low today.</i>

350
00:20:47,465 --> 00:20:49,800
<i>But he is a doctor from Kanpur.</i>

351
00:20:50,134 --> 00:20:52,509
<i>He won't give up so easily.</i>

352
00:21:35,113 --> 00:21:37,059
Hail the Goddess.

353
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:57,121
Did you fill up the form
for the opening in Mumbai?

354
00:22:00,137 --> 00:22:04,504
I know that you don't want to
leave me alone in my old age.

355
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:09,245
However, son, Kanpur was as good
as Manchester, but not anymore.

356
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:13,095
And your salary here? Peanuts.

357
00:22:17,826 --> 00:22:19,420
Dad, people in metro cities...

358
00:22:20,095 --> 00:22:21,634
are like machines.

359
00:22:23,215 --> 00:22:26,699
Once I leave, you will keep pestering me.

360
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,291
"Son, will you visit during Diwali?"
"Son, will you visit during Holi?"

361
00:22:31,348 --> 00:22:33,426
Anyway your "practice"
is meeting our expenses.

362
00:22:34,368 --> 00:22:35,386
What's the problem?

363
00:22:35,425 --> 00:22:38,643
So, I should manage your wedding
and your sister's education by myself?

364
00:22:38,973 --> 00:22:40,964
Am I your father or the RBI governor?

365
00:22:41,675 --> 00:22:44,448
<i>The father thinks that his innocent son</i>
<i>is stuck here</i>

366
00:22:44,542 --> 00:22:47,001
<i>because he's concerned</i>
<i>about his ageing parents.</i>

367
00:22:48,293 --> 00:22:53,324
<i>Little does he know about the</i>
<i>tug of Cupid on his son's heart.</i>

368
00:23:03,434 --> 00:23:06,980
Wow! I think I should
start having alcohol too.

369
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:09,035
It looks good.

370
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,676
Relax, I'll quit drinking.

371
00:23:12,832 --> 00:23:14,652
You better!
Or even I'll start drinking!

372
00:23:14,809 --> 00:23:16,600
Don't worry. I will quit.

373
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:18,826
Last night, I had the last peg.

374
00:23:19,215 --> 00:23:21,132
I swear on Beena.

375
00:23:22,785 --> 00:23:25,746
Food is ready.
Have your medicines on time.

376
00:23:26,129 --> 00:23:28,668
I feel intoxicated after
having my medicines.

377
00:23:29,496 --> 00:23:31,566
And I am trying to avoid
any kind of intoxication.

378
00:23:31,637 --> 00:23:34,082
Really? Doesn't this affect your health?

379
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,193
If you don't have the medicine,
we'll have to go to the hospital!

380
00:23:37,243 --> 00:23:38,243
There'll be side effects!

381
00:23:38,268 --> 00:23:39,743
Even the ambulance takes
two hours to get here.

382
00:23:39,761 --> 00:23:40,644
Shut up!

383
00:23:41,535 --> 00:23:42,748
I'm your dad.

384
00:23:44,988 --> 00:23:48,404
Nowadays, whom are you...

385
00:23:49,168 --> 00:23:51,960
roaming around with all the time?

386
00:23:52,717 --> 00:23:54,131
What do you mean?

387
00:23:54,425 --> 00:23:56,334
It's just my friend Pratibha.

388
00:23:56,801 --> 00:23:58,467
Don't you know her?

389
00:24:00,418 --> 00:24:04,511
She wears a pant and a shirt,
has really short hair, right?

390
00:24:05,035 --> 00:24:06,493
She is quite modern.

391
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:10,519
He is Mr. Mishra's son.

392
00:24:10,879 --> 00:24:11,918
Who Mishra?

393
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,392
They live right opposite our house.

394
00:24:17,558 --> 00:24:20,792
Are you talking about
that fraud doctor's son, Jaitun?

395
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:26,957
But I have fallen in love with a boy.

396
00:24:26,982 --> 00:24:31,061
Unlike Mr. Sharma's daughter
who fell for a girl.

397
00:24:31,105 --> 00:24:32,386
You are stressing me out.

398
00:24:32,425 --> 00:24:35,886
-Just have your medicine.
-I don't know what you are up to.

399
00:24:36,754 --> 00:24:38,410
Did you hear her, Beena?

400
00:24:45,855 --> 00:24:47,355
Mom isn't here, Dad.

401
00:24:51,197 --> 00:24:52,350
It's been five years now.

402
00:25:00,689 --> 00:25:03,049
I have fallen in love with a genuine guy.

403
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,845
He loves me a lot.

404
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:11,998
I'll be here to look after you
even after I get married.

405
00:25:13,634 --> 00:25:14,978
Stop this nuisance already.

406
00:25:17,258 --> 00:25:19,774
I can live without you.
I have Beena.

407
00:25:20,345 --> 00:25:21,470
Don't worry about anything.

408
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:43,865
Good morning, ma'am.

409
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:47,009
How are you feeling?

410
00:25:53,488 --> 00:25:55,027
Give me your hand.

411
00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:00,737
Your health is getting better.

412
00:26:01,941 --> 00:26:03,394
The weather is changing.

413
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,417
You have some cough,
but you'll be all right.

414
00:26:09,512 --> 00:26:11,160
Have it thrice a day.

415
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:14,238
Why do you give her
these medicines every day?

416
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:16,433
She is my mother!

417
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:18,597
She is not a lab rat for
all your experiments.

418
00:26:19,004 --> 00:26:20,230
What are you...

419
00:26:20,316 --> 00:26:23,785
I have an ayurvedic medicine
for TB as well.

420
00:26:25,246 --> 00:26:28,458
Soon I will be featured in
international magazines.

421
00:26:28,483 --> 00:26:31,253
And all the intellectuals and scientists
will bow down in front of me.

422
00:26:31,285 --> 00:26:32,301
Of course!

423
00:26:32,326 --> 00:26:35,746
Einstein and Darwin are like
roadside ruffians, aren't they?

424
00:26:36,384 --> 00:26:37,464
It's not that great.

425
00:26:39,634 --> 00:26:41,134
-I will--
-Sir.

426
00:26:41,675 --> 00:26:42,886
Thank you, ma'am.

427
00:26:44,175 --> 00:26:47,300
The next time I come, please...

428
00:26:47,918 --> 00:26:50,105
-I will make it properly.
-Add ginger to it.

429
00:26:52,175 --> 00:26:55,151
-Why do you misbehave?
-He's insane...

430
00:26:56,863 --> 00:26:58,269
Please just stop it.

431
00:26:59,996 --> 00:27:01,246
What happened?

432
00:27:02,384 --> 00:27:04,217
Do you have any other medicine?

433
00:27:04,259 --> 00:27:06,751
He doesn't even know the difference
between TB and TV.

434
00:27:07,947 --> 00:27:08,989
That's not true.

435
00:27:09,217 --> 00:27:12,109
I hope my case gets dismissed soon

436
00:27:12,134 --> 00:27:13,517
so that I can join my job in Mumbai.

437
00:27:14,063 --> 00:27:17,369
You should also sell your shop
and join me there.

438
00:27:18,009 --> 00:27:20,907
We will get you treated
by a legit doctor.

439
00:27:21,128 --> 00:27:23,832
I will not go to any hospital.

440
00:27:23,916 --> 00:27:25,267
Why not?

441
00:27:26,072 --> 00:27:29,025
If I go to a hospital, I will die sooner
than expected.

442
00:27:29,658 --> 00:27:32,200
If I sell the shop,
we'll be left with nothing.

443
00:27:32,259 --> 00:27:34,596
So sad. I feel bad for our
existing riches already.

444
00:27:35,217 --> 00:27:37,092
Just stop taking medicines
from that quack of a doctor.

445
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:03,962
Since the trend of
online shopping took off,

446
00:28:04,451 --> 00:28:06,243
people have become too
lazy to even visit a shop.

447
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:09,228
Son, if you could...

448
00:28:11,368 --> 00:28:12,407
Right.

449
00:28:13,493 --> 00:28:16,292
I pursued a law degree only to end up
delivering groceries to people's houses.

450
00:28:17,611 --> 00:28:18,496
Sure, I'll do that as well.

451
00:28:19,978 --> 00:28:21,525
Do you need some groceries?

452
00:28:21,634 --> 00:28:23,158
I'll come right away to deliver it.

453
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:40,681
A father and a son
share a special bond.

454
00:28:40,939 --> 00:28:43,783
A good balance is as good as protein.

455
00:28:44,259 --> 00:28:46,728
And an imbalance can feel
like acidity.

456
00:28:47,595 --> 00:28:50,830
The cure for your acidity
is moving to Mumbai.

457
00:28:51,681 --> 00:28:53,697
Find a way out and leave.

458
00:28:57,759 --> 00:28:59,230
I will surely go to Mumbai.

459
00:29:02,361 --> 00:29:03,769
I tried my best.

460
00:29:04,634 --> 00:29:06,051
But I couldn't make it.

461
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,197
At least my song can.

462
00:29:15,134 --> 00:29:17,092
The eggs are yet to hatch,

463
00:29:17,681 --> 00:29:19,580
and you are already counting the chickens.

464
00:29:20,627 --> 00:29:23,799
<i>But before he could take off,</i>

465
00:29:24,118 --> 00:29:26,899
<i>his father grounded him in Kanpur itself.</i>

466
00:29:28,127 --> 00:29:31,392
Hey, call the electrician!

467
00:29:31,425 --> 00:29:33,121
We have no electricity out here.

468
00:29:33,181 --> 00:29:35,806
Why do you need an electrician

469
00:29:35,826 --> 00:29:37,488
when you can warm yourself
up with my "electric pole"?

470
00:29:37,685 --> 00:29:42,238
But do you have enough "supply"?

471
00:29:42,267 --> 00:29:44,150
I run on solar power!

472
00:29:44,252 --> 00:29:48,314
Running a current of 440 volts, 24/7.
I am Buzz Lightyear, sweetheart.

473
00:29:50,658 --> 00:29:54,050
I don't want to get a shock.

474
00:29:54,127 --> 00:29:56,832
Why don't you let me warm you up
just for once?

475
00:29:57,175 --> 00:30:00,073
You will be satisfied for life!

476
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:07,217
What if your "battery" goes down midway?

477
00:30:07,259 --> 00:30:08,977
That won't happen!

478
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:12,878
My "battery" will last all night long.
It won't let you down!

479
00:30:16,556 --> 00:30:18,589
Nonsense!

480
00:30:19,095 --> 00:30:21,517
Don't you see there's a kid
standing over here!

481
00:30:21,592 --> 00:30:23,038
Don't take him to be a kid.

482
00:30:23,259 --> 00:30:24,517
He is a mini generator!

483
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:27,113
-A mini generator?
-Yes.

484
00:30:27,368 --> 00:30:30,290
Son, she can really
do with some "supply."

485
00:30:30,315 --> 00:30:31,273
Yes!

486
00:30:31,884 --> 00:30:34,236
-Why don't you give her some?
-Be quick!

487
00:30:38,126 --> 00:30:40,513
I think the generator
needs some fuelling.

488
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:41,391
Is it?

489
00:30:41,425 --> 00:30:42,550
Load him up.

490
00:30:50,134 --> 00:30:53,306
Not me, him.

491
00:32:21,657 --> 00:32:24,949
He is just like me.

492
00:32:25,892 --> 00:32:28,837
The way a woman needs to be treated,

493
00:32:29,517 --> 00:32:31,572
what a woman feels,

494
00:32:31,782 --> 00:32:34,009
both of us know nothing
about all of that.

495
00:32:35,775 --> 00:32:37,032
Stop sulking.

496
00:32:38,592 --> 00:32:39,975
He is a good boy.

497
00:32:40,842 --> 00:32:42,319
I'll talk to him.

498
00:32:48,017 --> 00:32:51,720
What does a girl wish for?

499
00:32:53,486 --> 00:32:57,431
Women need all kind of love.

500
00:33:01,598 --> 00:33:03,082
All kind of love.

501
00:33:41,532 --> 00:33:46,454
<i>We won't jump across rooftops anymore</i>
<i>Just to meet each other</i>

502
00:33:46,743 --> 00:33:51,709
<i>I don't like hiding from the world</i>
<i>Just to love you</i>

503
00:33:56,514 --> 00:33:59,303
<i>Why are you being</i>

504
00:33:59,381 --> 00:34:01,608
<i>A dead end</i>
<i>In my love story?</i>

505
00:34:01,686 --> 00:34:04,178
<i>Why am I the accused</i>

506
00:34:04,256 --> 00:34:06,772
<i>In our under-trial love story?</i>

507
00:34:06,826 --> 00:34:09,483
<i>Why are you being</i>

508
00:34:09,553 --> 00:34:12,428
<i>A dead end</i>
<i>In my love story?</i>

509
00:34:12,493 --> 00:34:16,928
<i>Love has just become a dream now</i>

510
00:34:17,194 --> 00:34:22,236
<i>I don't believe in wooing</i>
<i>But authentic love</i>

511
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:27,434
<i>Take away my life</i>
<i>My love is of the diabetic kind</i>

512
00:34:27,499 --> 00:34:32,202
<i>I don't believe in wooing</i>
<i>But authentic love</i>

513
00:34:32,618 --> 00:34:37,352
<i>Take away my life</i>
<i>My love is of the diabetic kind</i>

514
00:34:38,324 --> 00:34:42,362
<i>I don't believe in wooing</i>
<i>But authentic love</i>

515
00:34:42,717 --> 00:34:44,529
Veggies for everyone!

516
00:34:44,558 --> 00:34:48,292
<i>Take away my life</i>
<i>My love is of the diabetic kind</i>

517
00:35:03,009 --> 00:35:05,136
You should lap me up for
some real-time vitamin exchange.

518
00:35:05,717 --> 00:35:07,425
We are not married yet.

519
00:35:07,464 --> 00:35:11,175
Once we are, we can exchange
vitamins and proteins all day long.

520
00:35:11,467 --> 00:35:12,927
What do you mean?

521
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:14,901
I got my friend's place to us
for two hours for no reason then?

522
00:35:15,009 --> 00:35:17,470
Do you want to watch television
or listen to music?

523
00:35:17,613 --> 00:35:19,760
What should I tune to? Tell me.

524
00:35:20,324 --> 00:35:22,925
Some snoop from the neighbourhood
has blurted out to my father about us.

525
00:35:23,009 --> 00:35:25,564
And since then,
he has locked up the rooftop.

526
00:35:26,826 --> 00:35:30,380
Look, either be a sissy,
or let my love take over.

527
00:35:30,738 --> 00:35:32,261
And how does marriage even matter?

528
00:35:32,425 --> 00:35:35,315
Do you want me to assure you in writing?

529
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:38,674
I am not a cheater.

530
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,175
Here you go.

531
00:35:41,011 --> 00:35:45,094
"If we have sex,

532
00:35:45,136 --> 00:35:51,670
I will marry you

533
00:35:52,386 --> 00:35:57,595
or remain single for life.

534
00:35:57,671 --> 00:36:00,202
Jaitun Mishra."

535
00:36:00,444 --> 00:36:01,475
Here you go.

536
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,061
I have signed it, you should too.

537
00:36:03,086 --> 00:36:06,294
Get it photocopied, and we shall
have one copy each.

538
00:36:11,759 --> 00:36:12,978
What else do you want?

539
00:36:37,452 --> 00:36:39,100
I thought you'll sing a song for me.

540
00:36:48,802 --> 00:36:49,793
Photocopy.

541
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,438
-Photocopy!
-Sure!

542
00:37:04,897 --> 00:37:09,381
Vijay, Dad is getting my uncle along
for the next hearing.

543
00:37:11,975 --> 00:37:13,694
Is he off his plaster cast now?

544
00:37:13,952 --> 00:37:17,217
You were the one who hit him.
There was no need to shove him so hard.

545
00:37:17,522 --> 00:37:20,124
So, you think that I...

546
00:37:23,686 --> 00:37:25,655
Why did you chop your hair off?

547
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:31,980
Dad forced me to sign the affidavit.

548
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,460
I got annoyed and chopped my hair off.

549
00:37:35,905 --> 00:37:37,958
But I still love you.

550
00:37:41,624 --> 00:37:42,928
Ms. Prem Kumari,

551
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:45,433
with all due respect,

552
00:37:45,835 --> 00:37:48,694
I am unable to leave Kanpur
because of this very love itself.

553
00:37:48,897 --> 00:37:51,467
So? I apologized to you.

554
00:37:51,827 --> 00:37:54,241
An apology here makes no difference.

555
00:37:55,389 --> 00:37:57,303
You need to say the truth aloud in court.

556
00:38:00,068 --> 00:38:02,154
I can fight with your dad and uncle...

557
00:38:03,259 --> 00:38:04,602
but not with you.

558
00:38:10,313 --> 00:38:13,828
I will come out and say the truth.
For sure!

559
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:16,353
Even I want the case to be over soon.

560
00:38:18,259 --> 00:38:20,127
Vijay, I want to tell you
something more.

561
00:38:20,392 --> 00:38:21,454
Tell me.

562
00:38:21,993 --> 00:38:25,013
Dad has created a profile for me
on a matrimonial website.

563
00:38:32,189 --> 00:38:33,474
Very beautiful.

564
00:38:34,056 --> 00:38:35,396
Five feet and five inches tall.

565
00:38:37,236 --> 00:38:38,747
You are as tall as a giraffe.

566
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:40,905
Again a lie.

567
00:38:42,775 --> 00:38:44,790
Mr. Pandey, how much for a printout?

568
00:38:45,063 --> 00:38:48,013
Rs. 10 for black and white and
Rs. 20 for the coloured one.

569
00:38:56,842 --> 00:38:58,889
You have turned my life so colourful...

570
00:39:01,181 --> 00:39:03,314
why should I get a black and white print?

571
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:04,992
I will pay for this as well.

572
00:39:10,235 --> 00:39:11,852
Sir, here's the medical certificate.

573
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:15,388
The girl's down with pox
and high fever.

574
00:39:17,376 --> 00:39:19,111
All right. Carry on.

575
00:39:19,486 --> 00:39:24,322
Sir, a couple was present
while this fiasco unfolded.

576
00:39:24,587 --> 00:39:26,642
I need your permission to call them.

577
00:39:27,618 --> 00:39:28,453
Permitted.

578
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:31,681
Ma'am, sir.
Please come forward.

579
00:39:35,408 --> 00:39:38,025
You need to come one by one.

580
00:39:38,259 --> 00:39:39,720
We are together.

581
00:39:40,062 --> 00:39:41,602
Shall we get you married then?

582
00:39:50,695 --> 00:39:51,695
What is your name?

583
00:39:51,783 --> 00:39:53,048
Pallavi Dixit.

584
00:39:53,423 --> 00:39:54,572
Ms. Pallavi...

585
00:39:55,298 --> 00:39:59,482
Were you at the mentioned location
on the 16th of September, 2017?

586
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:00,469
Yes.

587
00:40:01,078 --> 00:40:02,188
What did you see there?

588
00:40:02,306 --> 00:40:06,732
I was spending some quality time with him
by the lakeside.

589
00:40:07,142 --> 00:40:10,892
That's when I saw that man sitting
at a distance with his girl.

590
00:40:10,926 --> 00:40:14,968
Suddenly, the other man with the
plaster came and began beating him.

591
00:40:14,993 --> 00:40:18,618
When he tried to save himself,
it got worse for him.

592
00:40:18,697 --> 00:40:20,579
A few minutes later, the police arrived...

593
00:40:22,126 --> 00:40:23,728
How is he related to you?

594
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,688
-What?
-Fiancé.

595
00:40:35,775 --> 00:40:38,415
Oh, is it?

596
00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:39,650
Identification card?

597
00:40:42,391 --> 00:40:43,508
Here you go.

598
00:40:45,751 --> 00:40:48,165
Please have a seat.
You can come now.

599
00:40:55,298 --> 00:40:56,548
What is your name?

600
00:40:56,611 --> 00:40:57,634
Kajal Pandey.

601
00:40:57,704 --> 00:40:59,290
People know me as Peter.

602
00:40:59,509 --> 00:41:02,595
-I am an event manager. I organize...
-That's all right.

603
00:41:05,032 --> 00:41:06,751
Is she your fiancée?

604
00:41:08,078 --> 00:41:10,265
-Yes.
-Okay.

605
00:41:11,298 --> 00:41:16,236
I am sure you know
your father-in-law's name.

606
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:22,102
I address him as "Dad."

607
00:41:22,368 --> 00:41:25,285
I see!

608
00:41:26,092 --> 00:41:30,046
I'm sure you know
where your fiancée lives.

609
00:41:35,314 --> 00:41:36,884
-Yes.
-Tell us.

610
00:41:36,986 --> 00:41:40,236
She lives in the lane
behind the temple.

611
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,678
Sir, the thing is...

612
00:41:45,134 --> 00:41:47,377
there are 3,000 temples in Kanpur,

613
00:41:47,967 --> 00:41:50,373
and there is a lane behind every temple.

614
00:41:53,571 --> 00:41:56,883
How are the personal details
related to this case, sir?

615
00:41:56,908 --> 00:41:59,517
There is an act against
bringing fake witnesses too.

616
00:41:59,634 --> 00:42:02,134
You can check it in your diary,
smarty-pants!

617
00:42:03,399 --> 00:42:05,704
You are sullying our college's reputation!

618
00:42:06,134 --> 00:42:09,314
After mine, not a single batch from
our college turned out to be good enough!

619
00:42:11,415 --> 00:42:13,707
Prem Kumari will be presented
for the next hearing.

620
00:42:13,733 --> 00:42:14,983
Well tried. Keep practising.

621
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:17,634
Was it good?

622
00:42:21,015 --> 00:42:22,788
I hired her for a good price.

623
00:42:22,812 --> 00:42:25,046
She wanted to become an actress,
that is why I hired her.

624
00:42:25,655 --> 00:42:27,169
I am worried about my case,

625
00:42:27,218 --> 00:42:29,030
and you are looking
for the next Alia Bhatt.

626
00:42:30,201 --> 00:42:32,014
Are there auditions going on?

627
00:42:34,903 --> 00:42:36,206
Oh, man.

628
00:42:36,342 --> 00:42:37,952
How much more can we advise him?

629
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:41,271
He has landed himself in a mess,
yet he can't get over her.

630
00:42:41,675 --> 00:42:43,769
Don't even talk about her
in front of me.

631
00:42:44,425 --> 00:42:46,370
First, she ensnared him,

632
00:42:46,848 --> 00:42:47,884
and then she got him in this pickle.

633
00:42:47,913 --> 00:42:50,427
Of course. You are after all Mother Mary.

634
00:42:50,452 --> 00:42:52,796
Your son must be equally divine.

635
00:42:53,046 --> 00:42:55,796
No, no. For you,
I'm the latest incarnation of Satan.

636
00:42:56,327 --> 00:42:59,358
I have told you not to taunt me
early in the morning.

637
00:42:59,843 --> 00:43:02,427
I will surely get the case dismissed.

638
00:43:02,452 --> 00:43:04,077
That's what I have been hearing
for the last two-three months.

639
00:43:04,675 --> 00:43:08,146
If people come to know about it,
we will be forced to leave.

640
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,342
Dad, people have been fooling you.

641
00:43:10,429 --> 00:43:12,780
Oh, really?

642
00:43:12,897 --> 00:43:14,623
Do you think I'm a fool?

643
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:17,459
I should perhaps lock myself up
in the shop and set it on fire.

644
00:43:17,592 --> 00:43:20,053
-What nonsense!
-Then, both of you can enjoy.

645
00:43:20,085 --> 00:43:21,569
I can't understand--

646
00:43:21,592 --> 00:43:23,803
-What can't you understand?
-Oh, come on, Dad!

647
00:43:24,155 --> 00:43:26,506
Why do I even make tea for you?

648
00:43:26,577 --> 00:43:28,591
He cannot even get us a washing machine.

649
00:43:28,634 --> 00:43:30,259
Feels as if it's the stone age.

650
00:43:30,273 --> 00:43:32,257
Why did you even marry him?

651
00:43:32,546 --> 00:43:34,640
He must have been balding back then too.

652
00:43:40,218 --> 00:43:41,788
<i>Sing a song for me.</i>

653
00:43:41,983 --> 00:43:44,343
<i>Why should I sing a song for you?</i>

654
00:43:45,788 --> 00:43:47,632
I am not Kishore Kumar.

655
00:43:48,264 --> 00:43:51,319
Plus, we can do something better
if we don't waste time singing.

656
00:43:52,675 --> 00:43:55,050
You can help yourself to a protein shot.

657
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:56,886
You will have a sound sleep.

658
00:43:57,759 --> 00:43:59,764
Really? How is that so?

659
00:44:01,842 --> 00:44:03,259
I will kiss you,

660
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,694
and you can make those naughty sounds.

661
00:44:08,147 --> 00:44:10,046
<i>-All right?</i>
-Okay.

662
00:44:13,319 --> 00:44:16,929
<i>Harder! Harder!</i>

663
00:44:16,991 --> 00:44:19,062
<i>Harder! Harder!</i>

664
00:44:19,171 --> 00:44:21,710
Is this a devotional song?

665
00:44:22,085 --> 00:44:23,194
<i>Don't be weird.</i>

666
00:44:25,259 --> 00:44:29,455
Isn't it how the girl in the video
was doing it?

667
00:44:30,546 --> 00:44:33,093
What do I do? It's my first time as well.

668
00:44:34,655 --> 00:44:36,358
Imagine yourself to be a veena.

669
00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:40,218
And I am plucking your strings.

670
00:44:41,304 --> 00:44:43,280
Is it?

671
00:44:44,929 --> 00:44:50,670
<i>Do, re, mi, fa</i>

672
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:56,655
Has nobody romanced
in your family?

673
00:44:58,585 --> 00:45:02,022
Make sexy noises.
Imagine you have a backache.

674
00:45:07,358 --> 00:45:08,686
Exactly!

675
00:45:09,155 --> 00:45:10,186
Exactly.

676
00:45:12,648 --> 00:45:14,390
Consider love to be pain.

677
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:16,968
A sweet pain.

678
00:45:17,851 --> 00:45:19,124
Okay.

679
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:28,023
Can I give you kisses?

680
00:45:35,151 --> 00:45:37,003
Someone has rightly said,

681
00:45:38,187 --> 00:45:40,812
"Women need all kind of love."

682
00:45:42,475 --> 00:45:43,390
-<i>Really?</i>
-I love you.

683
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:47,576
Delicious, I tell you.

684
00:45:47,796 --> 00:45:49,679
If you are good at cooking

685
00:45:49,765 --> 00:45:51,835
and that is the only thing
you are good at,

686
00:45:51,937 --> 00:45:54,648
<i>the Super Chef challenge is just for you.</i>

687
00:45:54,749 --> 00:45:55,765
<i>What are you waiting for?</i>

688
00:45:55,843 --> 00:45:58,952
<i>We will meet on the 15th and 16th</i>
<i>next month in Lucknow</i>

689
00:45:59,069 --> 00:46:00,483
<i>for the open auditions.</i>

690
00:46:00,546 --> 00:46:02,460
<i>All the chefs will come together.</i>

691
00:46:02,522 --> 00:46:06,438
<i>For more information related to</i>
<i>the audition centres, drop an SMS</i>

<i>on 55566678.</i>

693
00:46:09,249 --> 00:46:12,468
<i>Super Chef Season 2 is coming soon.</i>

694
00:46:24,679 --> 00:46:25,765
Take this.

695
00:46:26,429 --> 00:46:28,577
Your birthday is coming up
next week.

696
00:46:28,757 --> 00:46:30,859
Why don't you buy clothes for yourself?

697
00:46:31,717 --> 00:46:33,311
We will have a special celebration.

698
00:46:36,296 --> 00:46:38,108
Keep it.

699
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:42,006
Open your mouth.

700
00:46:42,351 --> 00:46:44,991
Have it. Come on.

701
00:46:53,202 --> 00:46:56,327
I'll go for the auditions
of that reality show.

702
00:47:02,397 --> 00:47:06,938
No matter how colourful my stage looks,

703
00:47:08,249 --> 00:47:10,046
my life is still full of darkness.

704
00:47:11,759 --> 00:47:14,592
You are the firefly in my life.

705
00:47:16,733 --> 00:47:19,913
Don't ruin your life because of this.

706
00:47:20,194 --> 00:47:21,991
Is the TV show not worth it?

707
00:47:24,327 --> 00:47:25,764
How many make it on-screen?

708
00:47:26,296 --> 00:47:27,991
Ten in a million.

709
00:47:29,913 --> 00:47:31,069
What about everyone else?

710
00:47:32,171 --> 00:47:34,148
You only get to see
the tip of the iceberg.

711
00:47:34,257 --> 00:47:35,921
There's a whole world underneath.

712
00:47:36,944 --> 00:47:38,515
That's how Mumbai is.

713
00:47:39,702 --> 00:47:42,132
Why do you want me to
keep rotting in Kanpur?

714
00:48:00,241 --> 00:48:04,960
You can do whatever you wish
until your birthday.

715
00:48:05,749 --> 00:48:07,765
You will then start afresh.

716
00:48:29,976 --> 00:48:31,163
How much do you earn?

717
00:48:31,217 --> 00:48:32,983
I earn around Rs. 18,000.

718
00:48:40,991 --> 00:48:43,670
I will start earning more
once I get promoted.

719
00:48:43,741 --> 00:48:45,421
It will be doubled...

720
00:48:45,702 --> 00:48:46,821
almost.

721
00:48:49,077 --> 00:48:50,694
What stopped you from claiming more?

722
00:48:51,062 --> 00:48:53,170
Do you drink alcohol?

723
00:48:53,405 --> 00:48:55,101
No, absolutely not.

724
00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:56,569
Damn it!

725
00:48:57,569 --> 00:48:58,968
How useless can a fellow be!

726
00:49:01,858 --> 00:49:05,937
-Stop...
-I do, I do! Beer I can bear.

727
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:08,717
I usually have a chilled beer
during summers.

728
00:49:09,259 --> 00:49:10,517
Is it?

729
00:49:12,342 --> 00:49:14,100
Glad you aren't like your father.

730
00:49:14,798 --> 00:49:17,423
-Do you watch movies?
-Yes.

731
00:49:18,064 --> 00:49:19,251
Who is your favourite actor?

732
00:49:19,353 --> 00:49:22,571
Shah Rukh Khan.
I watch Bhai's movies as well.

733
00:49:22,728 --> 00:49:23,673
Bhai?

734
00:49:24,342 --> 00:49:26,232
Your relatives are in
the movie business?

735
00:49:26,329 --> 00:49:28,947
Not mine. Mr. Salim's son.
Everyone calls him Bhai.

736
00:49:29,079 --> 00:49:30,454
Give me some incense sticks.

737
00:49:32,884 --> 00:49:35,853
Do you take her to movies?

738
00:49:37,056 --> 00:49:39,131
-Yes.
-Corner seat?

739
00:49:41,736 --> 00:49:43,069
Corner seat.

740
00:49:43,790 --> 00:49:45,032
You are such a weirdo!

741
00:49:45,675 --> 00:49:48,455
To be falling in love with no one else,
but a neighbour.

742
00:49:48,837 --> 00:49:52,798
How lame a wedding procession
this would make.

743
00:49:53,353 --> 00:49:54,462
Let's go.

744
00:49:56,759 --> 00:49:59,048
I checked your horoscope
on the Internet.

745
00:50:00,439 --> 00:50:02,751
The stars seem to be in perfect alignment.

746
00:50:04,938 --> 00:50:06,980
You can get married in August

747
00:50:07,884 --> 00:50:10,397
because there is no other auspicious date
for the next eight years.

748
00:50:10,425 --> 00:50:13,323
-I will get married in August.
-But...

749
00:50:14,165 --> 00:50:15,345
Hey...

750
00:50:17,509 --> 00:50:19,092
Curb your enthusiasm a bit.

751
00:50:21,439 --> 00:50:23,545
What kind of sounds do you make at night?

752
00:50:27,510 --> 00:50:29,815
She had back pain, I guess.

753
00:50:31,074 --> 00:50:33,191
She thinks of you as
her Shah Rukh Khan.

754
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:38,977
But, until you get a promotion,
you won't be making any movie with her.

755
00:50:47,223 --> 00:50:50,309
<i>Jaitun seems to be doing well.</i>

756
00:50:51,043 --> 00:50:53,676
<i>After all, it's a feat to have</i>
<i>the girl's father approve.</i>

757
00:50:54,098 --> 00:50:57,215
<i>Now just one thing stops his</i>
<i>wedding bells from ringing.</i>

758
00:50:57,701 --> 00:50:59,238
<i>Promotion.</i>

759
00:51:00,512 --> 00:51:03,191
-Jaitun, your boss is calling you.
-What?

760
00:51:03,217 --> 00:51:05,842
Boss is calling you inside
the processing department.

761
00:51:09,509 --> 00:51:12,317
<i>Like they say, the really unlucky one</i>

762
00:51:12,342 --> 00:51:15,175
<i>will sprain his thumb</i>
<i>when he blows his nose.</i>

763
00:51:16,973 --> 00:51:20,730
<i>Jaitun was willing to work hard.</i>

764
00:51:22,223 --> 00:51:23,431
<i>Being a wilful Brahmin,</i>

765
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:28,043
<i>he was at ease while working</i>
<i>the peripheral functions</i>

766
00:51:29,215 --> 00:51:32,980
<i>but leather manufacturing was</i>
<i>the stuff of his nightmares.</i>

767
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:37,332
Stop chit-chatting and get to work.

768
00:51:47,824 --> 00:51:49,269
Which leather sheet is this?

769
00:51:58,051 --> 00:52:00,113
Sir, this looks like top grain.

770
00:52:00,207 --> 00:52:02,910
Great! Now this segment
is yours to handle.

771
00:52:03,574 --> 00:52:04,565
We are out of resources.

772
00:52:05,004 --> 00:52:08,671
As per calls from Mumbai,
production targets have been doubled.

773
00:52:09,512 --> 00:52:11,707
Sir, I will vomit to death here.

774
00:52:11,863 --> 00:52:14,559
Moreover, I want to supervise the plant.

775
00:52:14,668 --> 00:52:17,473
Even the water treatment
is not working fine.

776
00:52:17,566 --> 00:52:19,372
When people can be treated,

777
00:52:19,397 --> 00:52:22,292
why does the water need to be?

778
00:52:22,353 --> 00:52:25,087
Sir, Kanpur is known for the holy Ganges.

779
00:52:25,605 --> 00:52:27,387
What you are doing to it is pretty unholy.

780
00:52:31,378 --> 00:52:32,925
Do you really want a promotion?

781
00:52:35,262 --> 00:52:36,574
Focus on production alone.

782
00:52:37,342 --> 00:52:40,758
<i>Here I stand</i>

783
00:52:41,674 --> 00:52:46,389
<i>Right in the centre of the street</i>

784
00:52:48,107 --> 00:52:54,482
<i>What is my fault</i>

785
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:59,342
<i>If I see big dreams?</i>

786
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:12,107
<i>My desires were for the sake of it</i>

787
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:14,740
<i>Why did you ruin it?</i>

788
00:53:15,068 --> 00:53:17,639
<i>Why did you turn me into a joke?</i>

789
00:53:17,664 --> 00:53:20,566
<i>And, with little remorse, made it public?</i>

790
00:53:20,591 --> 00:53:25,758
<i>You kindled my desires</i>
<i>And then it all came falling down</i>

791
00:53:25,854 --> 00:53:28,823
<i>Oh, my fate!</i>

792
00:53:28,899 --> 00:53:31,732
<i>You turned out to be such a fraud!</i>

793
00:53:31,774 --> 00:53:34,774
<i>My fate is such a fraud</i>

794
00:53:34,839 --> 00:53:37,573
<i>My fate is such a fraud</i>

795
00:53:37,649 --> 00:53:40,607
<i>My fate is such a fraud</i>

796
00:53:40,649 --> 00:53:43,393
<i>My fate is such a fraud</i>

797
00:53:43,456 --> 00:53:46,479
<i>My fate is such a fraud</i>

798
00:53:46,504 --> 00:53:49,627
<i>My fate is such a fraud</i>

799
00:53:49,678 --> 00:53:52,925
<i>My fate is such a fraud</i>

800
00:53:53,527 --> 00:53:55,777
<i>My fate...</i>

801
00:53:55,802 --> 00:54:02,802
<i>My fate is such a fraud...</i>

802
00:54:14,625 --> 00:54:15,797
Did you call for groceries?

803
00:54:16,961 --> 00:54:17,789
Get it in.

804
00:54:24,531 --> 00:54:25,984
Rs. 780.

805
00:54:26,046 --> 00:54:27,859
I don't give a damn
about you being a lawyer.

806
00:54:27,884 --> 00:54:30,214
Keep the grocery inside,
or you can leave.

807
00:54:43,094 --> 00:54:45,609
There you are.
Hail Goddess.

808
00:54:46,304 --> 00:54:48,156
Your father said that
the delivery is free.

809
00:54:48,203 --> 00:54:49,854
I thought I'll avail the opportunity.

810
00:54:50,594 --> 00:54:53,102
Rs. 800. Keep the change.

811
00:54:59,664 --> 00:55:01,461
He is not a delivery boy.

812
00:55:02,406 --> 00:55:04,117
Would you like to have this cow urine?

813
00:55:05,002 --> 00:55:07,460
It's nice and hot.
Just got it out.

814
00:55:08,078 --> 00:55:09,097
It's fresh.

815
00:55:11,445 --> 00:55:12,624
Son...

816
00:55:13,398 --> 00:55:14,597
Hey!

817
00:55:14,622 --> 00:55:17,205
Keep feeding urine to the whole city.

818
00:55:17,468 --> 00:55:19,317
Won't you ever ask anyone
for tea or coffee?

819
00:55:28,469 --> 00:55:30,617
Hello, sir.
Yes, sir.

820
00:55:31,781 --> 00:55:32,823
Yes, sir.

821
00:55:33,617 --> 00:55:34,680
No, sir. I know.

822
00:55:35,687 --> 00:55:37,020
Tickets are booked, sir.

823
00:55:37,367 --> 00:55:38,242
Yes, sir.

824
00:55:38,469 --> 00:55:39,977
Why will you hire anyone else?

825
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:41,336
I am coming to Mumbai, sir.

826
00:55:42,227 --> 00:55:43,141
Yes, sir.

827
00:55:43,508 --> 00:55:45,359
Sure, sir. Yes.

828
00:55:45,727 --> 00:55:48,016
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

829
00:56:09,552 --> 00:56:10,881
Can't you see?

830
00:56:12,333 --> 00:56:13,450
Reverse the car.

831
00:56:15,759 --> 00:56:17,493
The king of dumbfucks!

832
00:56:19,942 --> 00:56:25,028
<i>It comes up with new acts</i>
<i>My heart is a trickster</i>

833
00:56:25,310 --> 00:56:30,076
<i>Just like the Pied Piper</i>
<i>Setting off a chase equally sinister</i>

834
00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:40,527
<i>It comes up with new acts</i>
<i>My heart is a trickster</i>

835
00:56:40,550 --> 00:56:42,175
<i>Just like the Pied Piper</i>
<i>Setting off a chase equally sinister</i>

836
00:56:42,193 --> 00:56:44,302
My father had an orchestra.

837
00:56:44,724 --> 00:56:46,224
He is dead.

838
00:56:46,259 --> 00:56:47,814
This is of no use to us.

839
00:56:48,896 --> 00:56:50,412
I am a college student.

840
00:56:50,506 --> 00:56:53,349
I will be able to manage
my college expenses with the money.

841
00:56:54,295 --> 00:56:55,795
Please help me out.

842
00:56:55,904 --> 00:56:58,388
<i>It comes up with new acts</i>

843
00:56:58,459 --> 00:57:00,959
<i>My heart is a trickster</i>

844
00:57:01,037 --> 00:57:03,495
<i>It stays mum</i>

845
00:57:03,539 --> 00:57:05,992
<i>And closely guards its secrets</i>

846
00:57:06,099 --> 00:57:08,623
<i>And lets them work their magic</i>

847
00:57:08,685 --> 00:57:11,131
<i>And makes the situation difficult</i>

848
00:57:11,215 --> 00:57:13,715
<i>The heart is such a merchant</i>

849
00:57:13,777 --> 00:57:15,668
<i>It can't look beyond its own interests </i>

850
00:57:15,675 --> 00:57:18,121
<i>I praise you, I praise you</i>

851
00:57:18,175 --> 00:57:20,698
<i>I praise you, my crazy little heart</i>

852
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:23,229
<i>I praise you, I praise you</i>

853
00:57:23,259 --> 00:57:25,790
<i>I praise you, my crazy little heart</i>

854
00:57:25,842 --> 00:57:28,217
<i>I praise you, I praise you</i>

855
00:57:28,259 --> 00:57:30,800
<i>I praise you, my crazy little heart</i>

856
00:57:30,925 --> 00:57:33,550
Doctor! How are you?

857
00:57:33,941 --> 00:57:35,730
-I am fine.
-Please come in.

858
00:57:35,831 --> 00:57:36,934
I was waiting for you.

859
00:57:37,629 --> 00:57:40,067
Let me get some
piping hot samosas for you.

860
00:57:40,113 --> 00:57:43,254
-I've got some offerings for you.
-We will have that too.

861
00:57:43,588 --> 00:57:45,276
I will feed you samosas as well.
Come in.

862
00:57:45,301 --> 00:57:46,214
Come in.

863
00:57:46,251 --> 00:57:47,824
How can you have samosas
with the offering?

864
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:53,599
You remember the quack I told you about?

865
00:57:56,621 --> 00:57:59,262
Even the TB patients
who are at their third stage

866
00:57:59,301 --> 00:58:02,488
can run a marathon across Kanpur
with this medicine.

867
00:58:03,168 --> 00:58:04,605
That also makes it a tad costly.

868
00:58:05,192 --> 00:58:08,144
Two packets of it will
be for Rs. 5,000.

869
00:58:08,914 --> 00:58:12,039
But you'll be cured after having it.

870
00:58:12,699 --> 00:58:16,074
Why did you take the pains for this?

871
00:58:19,504 --> 00:58:21,106
-Thank you.
-You are welcome.

872
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:44,510
Doctor.

873
00:58:49,103 --> 00:58:50,103
Thank you.

874
00:58:52,752 --> 00:58:53,669
Ma'am.

875
00:58:54,728 --> 00:58:56,062
Do have this cow urine.

876
00:58:56,986 --> 00:58:58,775
It ought to work its magic.

877
00:58:59,447 --> 00:59:02,189
I shall take your leave.

878
00:59:38,986 --> 00:59:40,064
What's your problem?

879
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:43,238
You are our problem.

880
00:59:44,673 --> 00:59:47,517
You think you rule here, Snow White?

881
00:59:48,111 --> 00:59:50,948
-You better stop coming here.
-Why?

882
00:59:51,747 --> 00:59:53,239
Are you the mayor around?

883
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:54,855
I am the doctor of this area.

884
00:59:55,533 --> 00:59:57,491
All these hunks hold medical degrees too.

885
00:59:59,416 --> 01:00:02,416
Sell your fake medicines in your locality.

886
01:00:02,853 --> 01:00:05,478
-And stay the hell out of here.
-Is it?

887
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:09,707
Or else, be ready to be operated upon.

888
01:00:17,283 --> 01:00:18,193
By the way,

889
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:20,138
Kajal...

890
01:00:23,572 --> 01:00:24,864
Kajal.

891
01:00:28,853 --> 01:00:30,144
Such sissies.

892
01:00:30,175 --> 01:00:31,675
You can't trust them for a penny.

893
01:00:32,642 --> 01:00:34,212
Thank goodness I found you.

894
01:00:34,673 --> 01:00:38,009
I have got this cast with a spell...

895
01:00:39,009 --> 01:00:40,722
especially for your dad.

896
01:00:41,009 --> 01:00:42,861
Once he wears this,

897
01:00:43,571 --> 01:00:45,220
his piles will be history.

898
01:00:46,377 --> 01:00:48,150
Is that fine?

899
01:00:48,217 --> 01:00:49,459
This...

900
01:00:52,994 --> 01:00:54,494
Bless you, my dear.

901
01:00:56,717 --> 01:00:58,576
You always have my blessings.

902
01:01:05,752 --> 01:01:07,011
Have you ever been to Delhi?

903
01:01:08,713 --> 01:01:09,832
Yes, once.

904
01:01:11,372 --> 01:01:12,806
I went there to give an MBA  exam.

905
01:01:12,895 --> 01:01:14,230
I failed, and I returned home.

906
01:01:14,943 --> 01:01:19,742
Do they have a machine
that helps you get your virginity back?

907
01:01:21,927 --> 01:01:24,810
I went there to give an MBA exam,
not a virginity test.

908
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,334
What happened? I am sorry.

909
01:01:35,092 --> 01:01:38,089
Shall I help you wear your dress?

910
01:01:38,974 --> 01:01:40,021
Here you go.

911
01:01:42,474 --> 01:01:43,857
Listen to me.

912
01:01:44,037 --> 01:01:45,818
Are you going home?

913
01:01:45,884 --> 01:01:47,415
Did you tell your parents about us?

914
01:01:47,849 --> 01:01:52,240
My father asked me to get
a better job away from the city.

915
01:01:53,849 --> 01:01:56,516
Why? What's wrong with Kanpur?

916
01:01:57,034 --> 01:02:01,638
All his friends' kids work out of India.

917
01:02:01,663 --> 01:02:03,562
They send all the imported items home.

918
01:02:03,756 --> 01:02:07,464
He wants the same for himself.
That's why he is bothering me now.

919
01:02:08,217 --> 01:02:10,420
That's great! Wonderful!

920
01:02:12,013 --> 01:02:14,974
Your company exports
leather goods, right?

921
01:02:14,999 --> 01:02:15,832
Yes. So?

922
01:02:16,224 --> 01:02:18,740
So there's no need for either of us
to leave the city.

923
01:02:19,178 --> 01:02:21,537
If they gift imported stuff,
you gift exported stuff.

924
01:02:23,553 --> 01:02:26,021
That's a wonderful idea.

925
01:02:26,803 --> 01:02:29,381
Your mind has started working well
right after you got some protein.

926
01:02:33,287 --> 01:02:34,420
What is this?

927
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:36,324
Do talk to your parents
about our marriage.

928
01:02:37,302 --> 01:02:38,873
-What is this?
-It's a photocopy.

929
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:41,637
You really got it done.

930
01:02:44,747 --> 01:02:46,925
You said Rinku won't be home
for two hours.

931
01:02:51,006 --> 01:02:52,849
-What are you doing?
-Go there.

932
01:02:52,951 --> 01:02:54,201
-This...
-Come with me.

933
01:02:55,967 --> 01:02:57,834
Sir, please give some milk to my kid.

934
01:02:57,872 --> 01:02:59,216
There ain't a dairy running here.

935
01:02:59,247 --> 01:03:01,825
Sir, some milk... for my kid...

936
01:03:01,951 --> 01:03:03,904
Please, sir.

937
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:14,414
Where are you off to?

938
01:03:14,506 --> 01:03:16,082
Are you blind?

939
01:03:19,592 --> 01:03:20,631
Greetings, sir.

I don't want it!

Lampat!

978
01:05:35,394 --> 01:05:36,433
Leave him!

979
01:05:36,691 --> 01:05:38,300
Don't even try to hit me!

980
01:05:39,722 --> 01:05:41,394
I had gone to a friend's wedding.

981
01:05:42,003 --> 01:05:43,417
Don't hit me.

982
01:05:44,039 --> 01:05:44,953
Come here.

983
01:05:58,042 --> 01:05:59,589
Why did you leave like this?

984
01:06:02,839 --> 01:06:04,683
You've become such a motherfucker.

985
01:06:27,918 --> 01:06:29,589
Son, it's better if you apologise.

986
01:06:30,214 --> 01:06:31,574
Why are you wasting your time?

987
01:06:32,759 --> 01:06:35,332
Why don't you sell the shop?
You are wasting your time too.

988
01:06:36,050 --> 01:06:37,191
I'm the father here, right?

CHAUHAN GENERAL STORE

990
01:06:59,050 --> 01:07:00,800
-Have a great day.
-You too.

991
01:07:19,722 --> 01:07:22,139
Isn't he the court clerk?

992
01:07:22,222 --> 01:07:24,472
Can't believe we are stalking this
lowlife to the stadium.

993
01:07:28,496 --> 01:07:31,417
His son should be the jack we need.

994
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:33,691
-Let's go?
-Let's go.

995
01:07:36,050 --> 01:07:38,097
-Please agree to it.
-Have you lost your mind?

996
01:07:38,122 --> 01:07:43,044
He is anyway getting your son into
Kanpur CPL. What's the harm?

997
01:07:43,395 --> 01:07:45,722
The kits cost a bomb now.

998
01:07:45,812 --> 01:07:47,937
-Such a motherfucker!
-Unlike our good old times

999
01:07:48,152 --> 01:07:52,785
when a bat and a ball were cheap enough
to set off a whole tournament.

1000
01:07:53,062 --> 01:07:55,680
He is in trouble.
Please understand.

1001
01:07:58,488 --> 01:08:01,035
Even if I charge 10 percent...

1002
01:08:03,894 --> 01:08:05,589
let's seal the deal at Rs. 2,50,000.

1003
01:08:05,855 --> 01:08:07,527
That's still too much.

1004
01:08:07,707 --> 01:08:09,996
My kid wants a bike as well.

1005
01:08:13,019 --> 01:08:14,683
Are you sure about it?

1006
01:08:15,058 --> 01:08:17,464
What do you want me to ponder over?

1007
01:08:18,050 --> 01:08:20,191
There is no other solution.

1008
01:08:21,472 --> 01:08:25,389
The insurance money will
help me kill the lawsuit,

1009
01:08:25,414 --> 01:08:27,497
and mom will be able
to start her treatment.

1010
01:08:37,597 --> 01:08:40,691
<i>What a phenomenal solution</i>
<i>this seems to be.</i>

1011
01:08:41,261 --> 01:08:44,437
<i>Pinning all his hopes
on the paltry insurance money,</i>

1012
01:08:44,808 --> 01:08:48,878
<i>he has come here to burn down</i>
<i>his own shop.</i>

1013
01:08:49,503 --> 01:08:50,307
<i>And...</i>

1014
01:08:51,347 --> 01:08:56,605
<i>And this is how Nero</i>
<i>set his Rome ablaze.</i>

1015
01:09:08,167 --> 01:09:09,863
Stop here.

1016
01:09:10,035 --> 01:09:11,574
Let's disband for now.

1017
01:09:14,175 --> 01:09:17,384
-All right, then.
-Keep this with you.

1018
01:09:17,425 --> 01:09:19,425
Are you crazy?
What am I supposed to do with it?

1019
01:09:19,441 --> 01:09:20,792
The doctor spilled the beans.

1020
01:09:20,894 --> 01:09:22,246
My dad is keeping a vigil.

1021
01:09:22,259 --> 01:09:23,931
-For a few days.
-But...

1022
01:09:24,996 --> 01:09:27,175
-Come on, man.
-Keep it with you.

1023
01:09:46,617 --> 01:09:47,766
Is your phone switched off?

1024
01:09:54,641 --> 01:09:55,507
What?

1025
01:09:57,050 --> 01:09:58,245
What happened?

1026
01:09:58,384 --> 01:09:59,806
We were waiting for you.

1027
01:10:01,092 --> 01:10:02,577
We have good news for you.

1028
01:10:04,259 --> 01:10:06,578
Your dad sold the shop.

1029
01:10:08,342 --> 01:10:10,186
That too for Rs. 12 lakh.

1030
01:10:11,359 --> 01:10:13,312
Let's go to sleep now.

1031
01:10:14,395 --> 01:10:17,419
I'll come to the court tomorrow
with the buyer. Get the documents made.

1032
01:10:30,296 --> 01:10:31,671
What happened to him?

1033
01:10:53,092 --> 01:10:56,999
<i>While Vijay had burnt his dad's shop,</i>

1034
01:10:57,558 --> 01:11:01,349
<i>Jaitun was already</i>
<i>taking all the necessary steps</i>

1035
01:11:01,374 --> 01:11:03,303
<i>to settle</i>
<i>the burning matter at home.</i>

1036
01:11:07,509 --> 01:11:10,431
Dad, I have got you
a new pair of shoes.

1037
01:11:12,217 --> 01:11:13,134
It's fine leather.

1038
01:11:13,717 --> 01:11:15,435
And this purse...

1039
01:11:15,858 --> 01:11:19,025
Mom, take a look at it.

1040
01:11:19,050 --> 01:11:20,839
This one's a luxury abroad.

1041
01:11:20,995 --> 01:11:24,786
Did you spend your entire salary?

1042
01:11:27,141 --> 01:11:29,100
What did you get for me?

1043
01:11:29,164 --> 01:11:31,133
Gudiya, I have got you a jacket.

1044
01:11:31,430 --> 01:11:32,976
I got a good discount.

1045
01:11:33,342 --> 01:11:34,561
Isn't it great?

1046
01:11:35,180 --> 01:11:39,471
Dad, why don't you check the belt?

1047
01:11:40,384 --> 01:11:41,790
Will this fit you?

1048
01:11:45,218 --> 01:11:47,202
It will fit me.

1049
01:11:49,390 --> 01:11:53,483
Unlike the girl
you find befitting to marry.

1050
01:11:54,555 --> 01:11:58,094
The girl who spends time with you
in your bedroom before marriage.

1051
01:11:58,384 --> 01:11:59,798
She was with me.

1052
01:12:00,592 --> 01:12:02,357
What do you mean?

1053
01:12:03,945 --> 01:12:06,171
What do you mean by that?

1054
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:10,886
Really?

1055
01:12:12,961 --> 01:12:15,500
-Calm down.
-So much audacity.

1056
01:12:16,335 --> 01:12:18,124
Such rubbish.

1057
01:12:18,550 --> 01:12:20,644
Calm down.

1058
01:12:22,259 --> 01:12:25,318
You could've waited to
get to your honeymoon.

1059
01:12:25,884 --> 01:12:29,064
Still would have been better
than getting caught pants down!

1060
01:12:29,968 --> 01:12:30,873
It all adds up.

1061
01:12:31,565 --> 01:12:33,190
Now I know why he isn't leaving Kanpur.

1062
01:12:34,124 --> 01:12:37,647
Remember, son, love is what ruined Devdas.

1063
01:12:38,175 --> 01:12:41,303
Or else, he would have had an empire.

1064
01:12:41,384 --> 01:12:43,259
But rich men don't have a film
made on their lives.

1065
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:45,341
Then you must have a film made
on your love story.

1066
01:12:46,164 --> 01:12:48,234
And be the next big thing
after Mr. Bachchan.

1067
01:12:55,272 --> 01:12:57,132
I have promised to marry her.

1068
01:12:59,398 --> 01:13:01,297
Her father has agreed.

1069
01:13:02,425 --> 01:13:04,222
I think you should meet him.

1070
01:13:07,531 --> 01:13:10,383
The auspicious time is in August.

1071
01:13:10,678 --> 01:13:12,203
Brother, what does she do?

1072
01:13:12,259 --> 01:13:14,150
She roams around with him all day.

1073
01:13:14,773 --> 01:13:16,383
"What does she do?"

1074
01:13:16,786 --> 01:13:18,620
Seems you have everything planned.

1075
01:13:19,634 --> 01:13:21,675
Why don't you book a priest
and a banquet as well?

1076
01:13:21,695 --> 01:13:24,789
Send us the address later.
We shall drop by.

1077
01:13:25,625 --> 01:13:27,381
No need to play such a hard-ass.

1078
01:13:27,592 --> 01:13:29,342
There will anyway be a lot
for you to do during my wedding.

1079
01:13:29,383 --> 01:13:31,217
What are you doing?

1080
01:13:31,266 --> 01:13:34,623
-I will not spare you!
-Why are you hitting him?

1081
01:13:34,634 --> 01:13:36,470
Put that new shoe down.

1082
01:13:37,133 --> 01:13:38,591
Take a deep breath.

1083
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:41,927
Another thing...

1084
01:13:42,786 --> 01:13:44,529
When you go to her house,

1085
01:13:45,092 --> 01:13:46,550
don't end up asking for a dowry.

1086
01:13:46,586 --> 01:13:49,484
Calm yourself down!

1087
01:13:49,509 --> 01:13:54,068
Kids like you can't stand the sight
of their fathers making a profit!

1088
01:13:54,172 --> 01:13:56,959
You'll get a heart attack!
Calm down.

1089
01:14:02,425 --> 01:14:05,245
Come on, move aside.

1090
01:14:10,546 --> 01:14:12,749
I will not spare the one who did this.

1091
01:14:13,078 --> 01:14:14,625
Move aside.

1092
01:14:16,414 --> 01:14:17,953
Calm down!

1093
01:14:18,875 --> 01:14:22,083
How long will the claim take to process?

1094
01:14:23,175 --> 01:14:25,383
A minimum of 30-40 days.

1095
01:14:27,867 --> 01:14:29,898
Everyone, be calm!

1096
01:14:31,134 --> 01:14:34,678
We've got your son into
the cricket team already.

1097
01:14:35,312 --> 01:14:38,645
That gets you a discount
of Rs. 50,000.

1098
01:14:39,411 --> 01:14:41,345
Be ready with the remaining
Rs. 2 lakh.

1099
01:14:41,370 --> 01:14:44,375
Or else, the next court hearing
is going to spell trouble.

1100
01:14:47,009 --> 01:14:48,556
The hearing is next week, right?

1101
01:14:48,925 --> 01:14:50,810
By when will you be getting the claim?

1102
01:14:51,509 --> 01:14:55,032
At least two to three weeks more.

1103
01:14:56,634 --> 01:14:59,391
Mumbai is where I want to be,
not prison.

1104
01:15:08,351 --> 01:15:09,492
Here?

1105
01:15:09,661 --> 01:15:12,245
Let's get you a wild card to Mumbai.

1106
01:15:14,944 --> 01:15:16,265
He is Qasim.

1107
01:15:16,499 --> 01:15:18,734
He is the one setting
the team for Kanpur CPL.

1108
01:15:18,759 --> 01:15:19,607
I see.

1109
01:15:19,632 --> 01:15:21,117
You mean a lot to him.

1110
01:15:21,161 --> 01:15:25,178
He talks about you a lot.
He considers you an ideal godfather.

1111
01:15:25,203 --> 01:15:28,406
Even if God and father don't
listen to me, he definitely will.

1112
01:15:28,453 --> 01:15:29,649
-That's great.
-Hello.

1113
01:15:29,969 --> 01:15:31,992
Kidnap him for three days.

1114
01:15:34,203 --> 01:15:35,376
Listen.

1115
01:15:36,550 --> 01:15:38,149
Make it three months instead.

1116
01:15:41,555 --> 01:15:44,180
A person couldn't return my money.

1117
01:15:44,495 --> 01:15:47,095
I got him tied to a rock
and thrown in the river.

1118
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:48,141
Okay.

1119
01:15:48,172 --> 01:15:49,836
My lawyer lost the case.

1120
01:15:50,624 --> 01:15:53,288
And my boy got life imprisonment.

1121
01:15:53,577 --> 01:15:55,710
Now, how can respectable folk
make a living like this?

1122
01:15:58,085 --> 01:16:00,647
Why don't you reopen
the case in the high court?

1123
01:16:00,786 --> 01:16:03,888
As a secondary witness,
get four fishermen.

1124
01:16:03,992 --> 01:16:06,750
They would claim that the victim
fell in the river while fishing.

1125
01:16:07,045 --> 01:16:10,045
The case will shift from murder
to culpable homicide.

1126
01:16:10,070 --> 01:16:11,562
We can then file a PIL

1127
01:16:11,672 --> 01:16:14,601
and argue that, since
there was no lifeguard present,

1128
01:16:14,703 --> 01:16:17,077
that man died on the spot.

1129
01:16:17,117 --> 01:16:19,351
The case will get transferred
from IPC Section 302 to 304.

1130
01:16:19,453 --> 01:16:21,411
Pay the bail amount,
and your lad will be out.

1131
01:16:23,884 --> 01:16:27,298
You turned out to be
more respectable than me.

1132
01:16:34,633 --> 01:16:37,841
-How much do you want?
-Rs. 2 lakh.

1133
01:16:40,188 --> 01:16:41,329
Half Plate.

1134
01:16:47,781 --> 01:16:49,164
Give them two bundles.

1135
01:16:50,375 --> 01:16:54,422
You'll owe me three bundles,
including tax.

1136
01:16:55,949 --> 01:16:57,292
By when will you return it?

1137
01:16:57,467 --> 01:16:59,425
-Well...
-In two weeks.

1138
01:17:00,781 --> 01:17:01,875
Two.

1139
01:17:05,883 --> 01:17:07,039
Thank you.

1140
01:17:10,516 --> 01:17:11,969
Good morning, sir.

1141
01:17:13,245 --> 01:17:15,110
Are you changing your cabin?

1142
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:16,504
I've got a bigger one.

1143
01:17:16,687 --> 01:17:17,828
What is this?

1144
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,946
Congratulations, you have been promoted.

1145
01:17:21,759 --> 01:17:23,236
Get your wedding invitation printed.

1146
01:17:23,259 --> 01:17:24,626
Are you serious?

1147
01:17:26,009 --> 01:17:28,157
You have benefited quite a lot.

1148
01:17:28,370 --> 01:17:29,845
You got promoted

1149
01:17:30,039 --> 01:17:32,125
and transferred as well.

1150
01:17:38,945 --> 01:17:40,153
Give me that box.

1151
01:17:41,827 --> 01:17:42,869
Hand me that box.

1152
01:17:50,422 --> 01:17:52,880
But I don't want to move out of the city.

1153
01:17:53,384 --> 01:17:54,801
You have just been promoted.

1154
01:17:56,055 --> 01:17:58,263
The head office is happy with your work.

1155
01:17:58,703 --> 01:18:00,870
Go to Mumbai and handle
a bigger consignment.

1156
01:18:02,922 --> 01:18:04,667
You didn't like it in here, right?

1157
01:18:05,370 --> 01:18:07,995
Go to Mumbai and do your best.

1158
01:18:10,172 --> 01:18:12,130
<i>Why do you want to be stuck here?</i>

1159
01:18:18,469 --> 01:18:21,309
Considering all the evidences
and witnesses,

1160
01:18:21,342 --> 01:18:25,509
this court finds Vijay Dinanath Chauhan
not guilty.

1161
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:27,893
The case is dismissed.

1162
01:19:15,989 --> 01:19:16,864
Tell me.

1163
01:19:18,039 --> 01:19:21,248
I truly loved your daughter.

1164
01:19:22,567 --> 01:19:24,365
And I would've definitely
kept her happier than you do.

1165
01:19:24,967 --> 01:19:28,425
But fathers in India
can't stand love stories.

1166
01:19:31,724 --> 01:19:32,872
And this...

1167
01:19:36,817 --> 01:19:40,020
Why do you want to lie
and get her married?

1168
01:19:44,036 --> 01:19:47,349
Sir, under IPC Section 466,

1169
01:19:47,856 --> 01:19:49,177
you can be sued for fraud.

1170
01:19:50,114 --> 01:19:51,217
Is that clear?

1171
01:19:52,052 --> 01:19:54,349
Keep this in mind. Goodbye.

1172
01:20:10,269 --> 01:20:12,058
Now that we are done with the case,

1173
01:20:12,083 --> 01:20:14,000
we just need to pay back Qasim
and we are sorted.

1174
01:20:17,294 --> 01:20:18,622
What? We will pay him.

1175
01:20:19,435 --> 01:20:21,560
Rs. 3 lakh in two weeks?

1176
01:20:21,832 --> 01:20:22,842
How on earth?

1177
01:20:28,388 --> 01:20:29,895
We will definitely get the money.

1178
01:20:30,372 --> 01:20:32,505
Just wait and watch for
Peter and Company's production.

1179
01:20:36,747 --> 01:20:39,216
I specially sourced your number.

1180
01:20:39,989 --> 01:20:41,708
How will we make it happen?

1181
01:20:42,284 --> 01:20:43,753
Listen to me.

1182
01:20:43,778 --> 01:20:46,582
Arrange for Rs. 1 lakh,
and you shall be the next Super Chef.

1183
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:48,785
-Rs. 1 lakh.
-Be quick.

1184
01:20:48,810 --> 01:20:49,934
It will be done.

1185
01:20:50,675 --> 01:20:53,230
I will get you selected as a finalist.

1186
01:20:53,325 --> 01:20:56,092
-Really?
-Trust me.

1187
01:20:56,134 --> 01:20:57,592
I am just doing this for humanity's sake.

1188
01:20:57,599 --> 01:20:59,544
Do you accept cheques?

1189
01:20:59,778 --> 01:21:01,755
It's not for my retirement fund.

1190
01:21:01,888 --> 01:21:03,067
Arrange for cash.

1191
01:21:03,122 --> 01:21:04,205
What did you cook?

1192
01:21:04,739 --> 01:21:06,531
-I prepared sushi.
-What?

1193
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:08,911
Yes, you ate it.

1194
01:21:10,020 --> 01:21:13,403
Yes, the sushi! It was delicious.
I wanted more of it.

1195
01:21:13,836 --> 01:21:15,508
You need to get me Rs. 1 lakh.

1196
01:21:16,914 --> 01:21:18,068
Rs. 1 lakh?

1197
01:21:19,068 --> 01:21:21,560
I could have called anyone I liked.

1198
01:21:21,592 --> 01:21:23,009
But you are the chosen one.

1199
01:21:27,779 --> 01:21:30,068
Babes, will you go out
for a movie with me?

1200
01:21:30,162 --> 01:21:32,115
I am not free.

1201
01:21:32,178 --> 01:21:35,076
I thought you got free in 1947.

1202
01:21:35,185 --> 01:21:38,560
-That was my mother, sweetheart.
-Is it?

1203
01:21:38,675 --> 01:21:41,779
No one could get a hold of me.

1204
01:21:45,896 --> 01:21:47,068
Who is that?

1205
01:21:47,795 --> 01:21:48,962
Englishmen!

1206
01:21:49,256 --> 01:21:52,756
Why do you have to always ruin it?

1207
01:21:52,912 --> 01:21:55,068
Who was that girl?

1208
01:21:55,372 --> 01:21:58,162
The one you already have, Kohinoor.

1209
01:21:58,209 --> 01:21:59,959
Have you come here to take a dump?

1210
01:22:00,164 --> 01:22:03,969
I am not able to handle it.

1211
01:22:05,455 --> 01:22:07,520
-What aren't you able to handle?
-The country.

1212
01:22:07,935 --> 01:22:10,074
I am not able to handle your country.

1213
01:22:10,099 --> 01:22:12,193
Be clear and stop rubbing your genie lamp.

1214
01:22:12,247 --> 01:22:14,668
Dad, I want to speak to you.

1215
01:22:14,693 --> 01:22:17,318
We'll talk at night
after the rehearsal.

1216
01:22:17,443 --> 01:22:19,474
I don't have time till then.

1217
01:22:21,412 --> 01:22:23,579
Take a break for five minutes.

1218
01:22:23,998 --> 01:22:24,857
Come here.

1219
01:22:25,381 --> 01:22:28,654
It better be really urgent.

1220
01:22:29,950 --> 01:22:33,974
-Tell me.
-I need Rs. 1 lakh.

1221
01:22:35,443 --> 01:22:37,318
The other day,
I was not attending a wedding.

1222
01:22:38,021 --> 01:22:40,021
I went for the Super Chef auditions.

1223
01:22:40,826 --> 01:22:44,646
They are asking for money
so that I can be a finalist.

1224
01:22:45,164 --> 01:22:46,148
My boy.

1225
01:22:46,580 --> 01:22:50,713
Why did you go for the auditions
in spite of me asking you not to?

1226
01:22:51,287 --> 01:22:52,995
I will definitely get selected.

1227
01:22:53,709 --> 01:22:57,928
The judge liked my food.

1228
01:22:58,342 --> 01:23:00,050
I see a ray of hope.

1229
01:23:00,451 --> 01:23:02,135
And I don't want to miss out on it.

1230
01:23:02,428 --> 01:23:03,654
Please don't ruin it.

1231
01:23:03,756 --> 01:23:05,395
The tickets sell for as much as paper.

1232
01:23:05,420 --> 01:23:07,287
And you are asking me for a lakh?

1233
01:23:09,537 --> 01:23:12,232
-Hey!
-I will shoot you!

1234
01:23:12,914 --> 01:23:15,414
-Shoot me.
-I am just asking you for the money.

1235
01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:16,533
Shoot me!

1236
01:23:17,217 --> 01:23:19,165
Let me see what matters more to you.

1237
01:23:19,849 --> 01:23:22,029
Your dream or your father.

1238
01:23:22,068 --> 01:23:25,271
Keep that rifle aside!
He will give you the money.

1239
01:23:25,404 --> 01:23:27,193
Lampat will give you the money!

1240
01:23:27,217 --> 01:23:29,480
Why are you bouncing around?

1241
01:23:29,505 --> 01:23:31,685
-Hey...
-He will shoot you!

1242
01:23:31,710 --> 01:23:33,553
I am warning you!

1243
01:24:09,334 --> 01:24:11,638
Do you have a technical degree?

1244
01:24:12,365 --> 01:24:14,865
Sir, I've completed my bachelor's degree.

1245
01:24:17,013 --> 01:24:19,029
Might as well grab a machine here
and get to work.

1246
01:24:36,539 --> 01:24:38,912
<i>In this season of love</i>

1247
01:24:38,937 --> 01:24:44,014
<i>I am like a restless soul</i>

1248
01:24:45,759 --> 01:24:48,516
<i>My heart feels</i>

1249
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:54,342
<i>That both of us are one</i>

1250
01:24:55,226 --> 01:24:59,226
<i>There is no harm</i>

1251
01:24:59,251 --> 01:25:02,929
<i>In feeling the way I feel</i>

1252
01:25:03,312 --> 01:25:07,624
<i>The heart considers you to be mine</i>

1253
01:25:07,649 --> 01:25:11,797
<i>You belong to no one else</i>

1254
01:25:13,038 --> 01:25:17,163
-That's not me, that's my mother.
-Is it?

1255
01:25:17,273 --> 01:25:19,508
No one could get a hold of me.

1256
01:25:20,797 --> 01:25:22,906
Really, my dear?

1257
01:25:23,117 --> 01:25:24,484
Hey!

1258
01:25:24,836 --> 01:25:26,179
Englishmen!

1259
01:25:27,383 --> 01:25:30,147
Why do you have to always ruin it?

1260
01:25:30,202 --> 01:25:32,631
I am not able to handle it.

1261
01:25:33,506 --> 01:25:36,592
-What aren't you able to handle?
-The country.

1262
01:25:36,639 --> 01:25:39,506
Why don't you say it clearly?

1263
01:25:39,570 --> 01:25:41,429
LAMPAT HARAMI
AND COMPANY

1264
01:26:05,281 --> 01:26:07,375
Take this.

1265
01:26:07,455 --> 01:26:11,631
This is the money that
people have showered over me.

1266
01:26:12,218 --> 01:26:13,742
It's white money

1267
01:26:15,070 --> 01:26:16,381
that I've earned.

1268
01:26:17,038 --> 01:26:20,959
Just go away. Run away!

1269
01:26:21,406 --> 01:26:24,883
This is your last chance.

1270
01:26:30,328 --> 01:26:32,422
I will never return here.

1271
01:26:36,047 --> 01:26:37,226
Never.

1272
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:42,007
Kohinoor! Kohinoor!

1273
01:26:49,211 --> 01:26:51,679
<i>You seem to be good</i>

1274
01:26:51,750 --> 01:26:55,445
<i>But you are a different person</i>

1275
01:26:55,820 --> 01:27:00,945
<i>Your appearance is that of a thief</i>

1276
01:27:01,461 --> 01:27:05,808
<i>You've been stealing all your life</i>

1277
01:27:05,890 --> 01:27:11,098
<i>Your peace is locked up</i>
<i>In a vault of crime</i>

1278
01:27:33,342 --> 01:27:35,467
Are you doing me a charity, scumbag?

1279
01:27:38,343 --> 01:27:39,643
That's all I could manage.

1280
01:27:40,773 --> 01:27:43,601
-Please manage it for now.
-Who will count the money?

1281
01:27:43,789 --> 01:27:45,797
Peter.

1282
01:27:46,414 --> 01:27:47,453
He is the one.

1283
01:27:47,497 --> 01:27:49,092
Let us count it for you.

1284
01:27:49,117 --> 01:27:51,937
-Leave me!
-Stop right there!

1285
01:27:55,634 --> 01:28:00,259
<i>She danced with her anklets on</i>

1286
01:28:00,633 --> 01:28:06,008
<i>And I danced freestyle</i>

1287
01:28:06,086 --> 01:28:10,883
<i>She danced with her anklets on</i>

1288
01:28:10,925 --> 01:28:14,855
<i>Of what use is an arrow</i>

1289
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:20,457
<i>That misses its mark?</i>

1290
01:28:20,539 --> 01:28:24,187
<i>She danced with her anklets on...</i>

1291
01:28:31,300 --> 01:28:33,511
My dad acts strong, but he is not.

1292
01:28:35,218 --> 01:28:38,199
I always believed marrying you
will help me keep a watch on him.

1293
01:28:39,830 --> 01:28:41,839
Will he agree to get you married
to a jobless man?

1294
01:28:45,634 --> 01:28:46,800
I don't know.

1295
01:28:52,405 --> 01:28:54,148
We can take him along to Mumbai.

1296
01:28:56,314 --> 01:28:58,082
He would never leave Kanpur.

1297
01:29:07,406 --> 01:29:08,906
Come along with me to Mumbai.

1298
01:29:11,039 --> 01:29:12,581
I will sing songs for you.

1299
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:15,214
You think you are Kishore Kumar.

1300
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:20,157
Am I not your Kishore Kumar?

1301
01:29:45,461 --> 01:29:48,609
<i>He leapt onto the sky</i>

1302
01:29:50,913 --> 01:29:58,122
<i>And swayed with the clouds</i>

1303
01:30:00,984 --> 01:30:04,359
<i>It brought a storm in his life</i>

1304
01:30:06,140 --> 01:30:09,726
<i>He didn't know what to do</i>

1305
01:30:11,622 --> 01:30:16,739
<i>He leapt onto the sky</i>

1306
01:30:16,764 --> 01:30:19,229
<i>Swayed with the clouds</i>

1307
01:30:21,593 --> 01:30:25,135
<i>It brought a storm in his life</i>

1308
01:30:37,008 --> 01:30:42,550
<i>He leapt onto the sky</i>

1309
01:30:42,642 --> 01:30:46,977
<i>Swayed with the clouds</i>

1310
01:30:47,675 --> 01:30:50,120
<i>He couldn't understand</i>

1311
01:30:50,250 --> 01:30:52,843
<i>What was to be done</i>

1312
01:30:54,050 --> 01:30:57,253
<i>When the sky leapt at him</i>
<i>And swayed the clouds</i>

1313
01:30:57,342 --> 01:30:59,141
Who are these boys?

1314
01:31:00,562 --> 01:31:03,021
-They are my friends, Dad.
-Okay.

1315
01:31:11,497 --> 01:31:15,968
QASIM'S MEN ARE AT MY DOOR
COME SOON

1316
01:31:20,550 --> 01:31:21,690
Hey, Full Plate.

1317
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,593
Let's come back after a stroll.

1318
01:31:35,305 --> 01:31:37,125
-I'll get a rickshaw.
-Hey.

1319
01:31:37,210 --> 01:31:38,265
Please come.

1320
01:31:41,015 --> 01:31:43,797
Sir, we saw the CCTV footage
of your store

1321
01:31:43,872 --> 01:31:46,186
-and arrested a boy last night.
-I see.

1322
01:31:46,211 --> 01:31:47,406
Who is he?

1323
01:31:47,633 --> 01:31:50,289
He revealed that your son
was also involved.

1324
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:54,251
What are you saying?
Have you lost your mind?

1325
01:31:54,297 --> 01:31:55,820
Ma'am, please get away.

1326
01:31:55,883 --> 01:31:58,461
Why are you stopping me?

1327
01:31:58,570 --> 01:32:00,773
What are you doing?

1328
01:32:00,859 --> 01:32:02,390
Hey, step back!

1329
01:32:02,461 --> 01:32:04,773
-Look at what he is up to.
-Step back!

1330
01:32:04,906 --> 01:32:07,328
I am leaving for Mumbai.

1331
01:32:07,398 --> 01:32:09,500
-What is he doing?
-Please!

1332
01:32:09,586 --> 01:32:10,937
Let me go.

1333
01:32:11,718 --> 01:32:13,297
-Son...
-Dad.

1334
01:32:13,414 --> 01:32:15,804
I didn't want to do this.
I was trapped.

1335
01:32:15,875 --> 01:32:17,937
Step back!

1336
01:32:21,656 --> 01:32:26,023
<i>The sky pushed back</i>

1337
01:32:26,820 --> 01:32:30,921

01:32:31,997 --> 01:32:36,872
<i>The sky pushed back</i>

1339
01:32:37,109 --> 01:32:40,984
<i>It's when he got to know</i>

1340
01:32:41,773 --> 01:32:47,190
<i>The flight was nothing but a dream</i>

1341
01:32:47,497 --> 01:32:51,223
<i>And the fall was all too real</i>

<i>The world's a conundrum</i>

1343
01:32:57,864 --> 01:33:02,280

<i>A complication of dreams</i>

I... Junior Lampat...

1357
01:35:26,531 --> 01:35:28,832
would like to share
dirty jokes with you,

1358
01:35:30,234 --> 01:35:34,317
and show you
wet dreams of Kohinoor.

1359
01:35:34,390 --> 01:35:36,047
What wet dreams
can you show me, boy?

1360
01:35:36,122 --> 01:35:37,723
You can't be like him.

1361
01:35:37,820 --> 01:35:40,351
-Last night...
-You're good for nothing!

1362
01:35:40,593 --> 01:35:43,359
Dad and I got excited by the same thing.

1363
01:35:43,398 --> 01:35:45,014
What was it?

1364
01:35:45,050 --> 01:35:46,640
I am talking about my dream.

1365
01:35:47,656 --> 01:35:49,028
What could happen?

1366
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:54,866
All my dreams were shattered soon.

1367
01:35:55,133 --> 01:35:58,679
-That's interesting.
-I just understood one thing.

1368
01:36:00,997 --> 01:36:04,122
When... a big dream
gets shattered...

1369
01:36:06,140 --> 01:36:07,989
you have a choice to hold on to it,

1370
01:36:08,672 --> 01:36:13,137
for those shattered pieces are
also a part of your big dream.

1371
01:36:15,383 --> 01:36:19,375
And when life screws you over...

1372
01:36:19,455 --> 01:36:20,898
That's Jugnu.

1373
01:36:20,976 --> 01:36:26,172
...perhaps it's just trying you
before heralding better times.

1374
01:36:26,273 --> 01:36:28,140
That was superb!

1375
01:36:28,281 --> 01:36:30,203
Great!

1376
01:36:36,133 --> 01:36:37,598

1378
01:36:43,578 --> 01:36:47,562
Last week, I bumped into a guy.

1379
01:36:47,695 --> 01:36:49,672
His name was Vikas.

1380
01:36:50,413 --> 01:36:53,211
He was dressed as a woman.

1381
01:36:55,343 --> 01:36:59,222
I had to ask him
if it was just the outerwear

1382
01:36:59,247 --> 01:37:01,247
or if the innerwear
was also quite different.

1383
01:37:02,828 --> 01:37:05,461
He is just like Lampat!

1384
01:37:05,718 --> 01:37:08,398
That was great!

1385
01:37:16,492 --> 01:37:18,531
Congratulations, you finally
have the son you need.

01:37:32,759 --> 01:37:35,236
<i>would be as twisted as</i>
<i>the lives in this city,</i>

1388
01:37:35,759 --> 01:37:37,955
<i>and that the last leg of their journey
would toss it all around for them.</i>

1389
01:37:39,092 --> 01:37:40,412
<i>That's how dreams are.</i>

1390
01:37:41,243 --> 01:37:42,926
<i>Easy to be dreamt,</i>

1391
01:37:43,509 --> 01:37:46,842
<i>but fickle and fragile.</i>

1392
01:37:48,175 --> 01:37:52,677
<i>But how can life stop</i>
<i>in a city like Kanpur?</i>

1393
01:37:53,141 --> 01:37:56,536
<i>Such is the circle of life.</i>

1394
01:37:56,759 --> 01:37:58,442
<i>At every point lies a surprise.</i>

1395
01:37:59,924 --> 01:38:02,549
You are really crafty

1396
01:38:02,610 --> 01:38:04,579
to be getting away every time.

1397
01:38:06,712 --> 01:38:08,634
That's the talent I was looking for.

1398
01:38:10,142 --> 01:38:13,423
You are now officially Don Qasim's lawyer.

1399
01:38:16,393 --> 01:38:19,067
<i>The one who decodes life's mysteries</i>

1400
01:38:19,143 --> 01:38:21,762
<i>just might end up
ruling his own streets.</i>

1401
01:38:26,525 --> 01:38:28,223
<i>If your motives are strong,</i>

1402
01:38:28,254 --> 01:38:31,778
<i>you can make do with the present</i>
<i>while a new life might find you.</i>

1403
01:38:32,736 --> 01:38:34,103
Ticket sales are up.

1404
01:38:34,674 --> 01:38:36,674
Perhaps you can start
your own restaurant.

1405
01:38:38,463 --> 01:38:40,588
The whole city might just
go mad over your sushi.

1406
01:38:52,187 --> 01:38:55,820
<i>Someone great has rightly said,</i>

1407
01:38:55,929 --> 01:38:57,990
<i>"Even if you take the man out of Kanpur,</i>

1408
01:38:58,015 --> 01:38:59,922
<i>you can't take Kanpur
out of the man."</i>

1409
01:39:03,203 --> 01:39:04,348
Hello.

1410
01:39:05,470 --> 01:39:06,970
Excuse me!

1411
01:39:08,547 --> 01:39:09,702
Yes?

1412
01:39:09,859 --> 01:39:13,492
You sing just like Kishore Kumar.
Wow!

1413
01:39:14,141 --> 01:39:16,562
-Why are you here?
-What do you mean?

1414
01:39:16,842 --> 01:39:20,217
You should have been at a studio.

1415
01:39:20,842 --> 01:39:24,384
You shouldn't be wasting
your talent here.

1416
01:39:24,634 --> 01:39:25,759
You are mocking me, aren't you?

1417
01:39:25,804 --> 01:39:28,272
I swear I am not!

1418
01:39:29,592 --> 01:39:30,723
Can I sing another song?

1419
01:39:32,883 --> 01:39:37,758
<i>I met</i>

1420
01:39:38,009 --> 01:39:42,580
<i>A beautiful stranger...</i>

1421
01:39:43,675 --> 01:39:46,894
<i>I'll let you in on a secret</i>
<i>before we part.</i>

1422
01:39:47,789 --> 01:39:49,997
<i>Cities of dreams are many.</i>

1423
01:39:50,710 --> 01:39:55,881
<i>But only Kanpur holds the copyright
for being the home of shattered dreams.</i>
