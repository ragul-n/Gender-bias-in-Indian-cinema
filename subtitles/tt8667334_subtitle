4
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:50,708
'Bow down, O people... Before Saint Anthony'

5
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:57,000
'The one blessed by God... Hail Saint Anthony'

6
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,000
'Hail Saint Anthony'

7
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,833
You wastrel!

8
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:04,375
You coir-head!

9
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:06,000
You fish-face!

10
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,125
Will you bring shame to our village?

11
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:09,791
This is Kadamakudy.

12
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:12,041
Kudy (Drinking) is our Kadama (duty).

13
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:15,666
Duty! No gentleman gets drunk and sloshed like this.

14
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:17,375
My dear gentleman!

15
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:18,416
Don't go!

16
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:21,375
On the day of the festival at St. Anthony's Church...

17
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:25,958
who else is there in this Kadamakudy Panchayat who's not drunk, other than you?

18
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:27,416
Who else is there?

19
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:28,416
What a question!

20
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:32,416
Look! Kombanayil John sir.

21
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:42,875
You...

22
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:44,541
What?

23
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:45,250
What is it?

24
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,666
Scaring me? - Stop this nonsense. Move!

25
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,000
Sorry sir.

26
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,166
He's a relative of mine.

27
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:52,041
He came for the festival from the other shore.

28
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:56,958
He didn't know who you are, sir.

29
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,000
Do you know who that is? - No.

30
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,000
The only educated person in this village.

31
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,375
An advocate who knows all the laws by heart.

32
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:08,375
Kombanayil John sir.

33
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:17,416
Sir, labour pain has started for Lisykkutty.

34
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:19,875
Let's call the midwife. - We'll go and bring her, sir.

35
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:22,208
That's not necessary. We'll take her to the hospital on the other shore. - Sir...

36
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:23,625
It's about to rain.

37
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:24,791
Let's call the midwife.

38
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:27,291
I don't believe in the old ways of this village, and I'm not interested in them.

39
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,375
I'll decide where my wife should deliver our baby.

40
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:30,958
Get the boat! - Sir!

41
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,666
We won't reach the hospital, and we won't get the child.

42
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:35,208
Shut up, you old woman. - Oh God!

43
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,083
Sir, be careful.

44
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:38,791
Get down carefully.

45
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:42,791
Oh God!

46
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:46,958
The word of the Lord came to me, saying,

47
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:51,166
Before I formed you in the womb I knew you...

48
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:52,875
and before you were born,

49
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,875
I set you apart and appointed you a prophet to the nations.

50
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:15,500
You should have brought her a little earlier.

51
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,708
Sorry.

52
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,000
We couldn't save the child.

53
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,000
Oh God! I can't stay where the child has been killed!

54
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:30,750
My dear...

55
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,750
Why did this have to happen to you, my dear?

56
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:45,625
You rascal!

57
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,833
Didn't I tell you that we'll call a midwife?

58
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:54,416
You killed the child!

59
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:57,250
What's the point in being educated?

60
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:02,416
You didn't listen to your elders!

61
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:06,416
Oh God!

62
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:10,958
Doctor!

63
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:14,958
That child is moving. The leg is moving!

64
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:41,833
Hey! He has come back from death.

65
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:45,833
So he's quite special.

66
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:51,708
Are you happy now, sir?

67
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:55,708
Oh no!

68
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:16,041
'Kombanayil'

69
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:26,375
No more discussions on this.

70
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:30,375
I'll say a mighty name that suits the child of Kombanayil.

71
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:38,541
Batistuta.

72
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:52,000
Seems like it didn't work out.

73
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,750
Then let's find some other name.

74
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,666
Sir...

75
00:07:57,166 --> 00:08:00,666
Shall I say a name?

76
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:06,041
The one who came back from death...

77
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:08,750
Ramanan.

78
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,875
Awesome, right?

79
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:13,333
What nonsense is this?

80
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,375
You've thrown me out because I said a name?

81
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:16,833
Did I say any cuss word?

82
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,666
I said a better name than 'Vachikkutta', right?

83
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,916
I swear on my mother, that I'll never come back here.

84
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,333
Hey!

85
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,166
There's a name that I like.

86
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:30,166
We shall name our child that.

87
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:34,416
That's an awesome name.

88
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:36,000
Truly, a variety.

89
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,583
We call him Lallu at home.

90
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,541
We could have admitted him at the Government school next to our house.

91
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:43,125
But you know why we brought him here?

92
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:47,125
We want a well-disciplined boy.

93
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,625
- I don't want to study! - Sit here, son.

94
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:56,375
I don't want to study! - Come with me, son.

95
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:57,875
Come on! - Leave me.

96
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,333
Don't you want to study and become a doctor?

97
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:02,750
- I don't want to be anyone. - Why are you crying?

98
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,750
Sit. - I want to be a JCB driver, dad!

99
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:18,500
We also want candy!

100
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,291
Lallu, we like you a lot.

101
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:25,375
Hey! Consider me like your brother.

102
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:29,375
Please.

103
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,500
Lallu...

104
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
All the toys for you to play, are here.

105
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,125
With that...

106
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,958
With that, Pappi and you should play sitting here, without fighting.

107
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:54,000
You heard me?

108
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,208
And don't hang around with the slum kids of the 3 cent colony in this village.

109
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:02,208

'The enticing childhood is showering upon the Kuttanadan fields, like rain'

118
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:14,250
There!

119
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:18,250
Lallu!

120
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:47,375
When people like you come, we must serve lunch...

121
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,500
Hey!

Don't waste your time coming after me.

137
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:33,041
I'll have a love marriage.

138
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:37,375
But I haven't seen a girl who has created a spark in my heart, yet.

139
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,500
Like a soft breeze,

140
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,166
she will come one day.

141
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:42,916
I am waiting for her.

142
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:47,041
An awesome, fantastic and terrific wait!

143
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:48,291
So...

00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:49,625

Bless my Lulu Mall alone with good business.

149
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:22,000
Sheesh!

150
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,625
How much, Chetta?

151
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:29,791
He doesn't know to calculate. - How much?

152
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:31,666
Give me whatever you feel like giving.

153
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:32,708
Tell me, Chetta.

154
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:34,541
Why do we need such formalities between us?

155
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,416
Check the amount, Chetta.

156
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:38,666
As if you're eating here for the first time. Give it!

157
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:39,958
Just calculate, Chetta.

158
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,250
What all did you eat? - 2 pieces of 'Puttu'.

159
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,625
One peas curry.

160
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:44,750
One tea.

161
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,375
And one banana as well.

162
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,916
I'm so busy here, I don't want your money now. Get going!

163
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:51,000
I'll give it in the evening, when I come for tea.

164
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,416
Calculate it and keep.

165
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:54,958
He'll come again in the evening for tea?

166
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:56,208
Chetta!

167
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,250
Two cups of tea, please. - Get lost!

168
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,583
You'll sit there, sipping tea and talking ill about the villagers, till evening.

169
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:03,375
Do you have any idea how much you owe me?

170
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:04,625
You won't go for any job also...

171
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:07,083
Chetta, it's not like we don't wish to pay you back.

172
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:08,666
We're all starving at home.

173
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:12,416
My dad has been lazing around at home for a week now, without going for work.

174
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:15,875
Can't he go for work, at least to make money to buy medicines for his wife?

175
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,000
Finally I asked my grandpa to go for work.

176
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,416
He said he slogged like a dog till he was 90,

177
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:21,916
and he can't do it anymore!

178
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:23,375
This is so sad!

179
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,291
I'm trying hard to forgive and live on.

180
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,375
You know? - You've grown as big as a pig. Can't you go for work?

181
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:32,750
When my dad and grandpa are alive, if I go for work, won't they have an ego issue?

182
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,625
The tail shouldn't wag, when the head is in form.

183
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:37,750
My greatest sorrow is that I don't have a younger brother, who can go for work.

184
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,083
Such frauds you guys are. Give the money for what you ate!

185
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:42,583
Say that... Calculation!

186
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,791
Then calculate and tell us. How much is it?

187
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:47,125
Tell us. How much is it? - Go ahead. We'll pay.

188
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:48,125
Calculate and tell us!

189
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:51,083
God will punish you for this!

190
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,250
Where are you off to in a hurry, Member? - To Kombanayil.

191
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:54,500
To Kombanayil?

192
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,500
Then there must be some problem.

193
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,208
Here. Keep this as well.

194
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:05,541
Tender mango pickle, Rasnadi powder, Unniyappam.

195
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:06,833
It's all available in Bangalore too, mom.

196
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:07,750
Yeah right!

197
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,708
I'm not the kind of cheesy mom who packs all this stuff teary eyed,

198
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,041
when my son goes away to a different place.

199
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:14,666
This is a blanket.

200
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,583
It's Bangalore, right?

201
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,583
You should always feel that your mother is with you.

202
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:21,416
This is for that.

203
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:22,375
Keep this.

204
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,333
It's my credit card. - What's this for, daddy?

205
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,333
Hey! This is ATM.

206
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:29,083
If you put it in a cold room on the road, we'll get money.

207
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,208
You studied engineering without knowing all this?

208
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:32,958
Vavuthathi...

209
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,000
Our gate is still closed, right?

210
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,125
Oh God! No, please!

211
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:39,666
Daddy, my basic salary itself is 1 Lakh. Then why do I need this?

212
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:43,625
Kombanayil John's son shouldn't lack anything at all!

213
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,166
Here. - Take it without throwing too much attitude.

214
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:47,791
John sir!

215
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:48,875
John sir!

216
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:50,083
John sir!

217
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:51,541
What is it? - Sir...

218
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,333
Sir, our Jankar (fat boat) is missing.

219
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:55,583
Oh Jesus! It went missing again?

220
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:59,583
Sir, please call Lallu.

221
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,666
This is so irritating!

222
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:08,208
I've been waiting for so long!

223
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:11,083
Our villagers are so foolish!

224
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:14,625
So many problems just because a Jankar went missing. - Yeah!

225
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:16,708
What's wrong if they don't go for work for one day?

226
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:18,583
Have we ever gone for work in our lives?

227
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:20,791
And do we have any problem?

228
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:26,750
If we don't catch the Jankar today, we needn't go to school. - True.

229
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,791
Bro, is there any possibility that the Jankar would return today?

230
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:33,083
Or today's journey would be intolerable and grueling. (In chaste Malayalam)

231
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:35,083
Right, bro?

232
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,041
No. (in Hindi)

233
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:41,916
Is he the migrant labourer, or me?

234
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:44,000
Bite it, fish.

235
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,416
Hey! Hey! Stop it.

236
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:49,208
This guys are crazy. Move.

237
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:50,708
Hey!

238
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,750
Hey! Stop it, I say!

239
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,416
Hey! - What atrocity are they doing?

240
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,125
Troubling all the people in vain.

241
00:17:58,625 --> 00:17:59,666
We've been waiting for so long!

242
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:01,250
We've lost our patience, standing here.

243
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,166
Well, let the police come.

244
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:08,166
There. The police has reached.

245
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:14,375
There's quite a big crowd.

246
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:17,333
I think the problem can be solved only if we go there and talk to them directly.

247
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:18,375
Call that Jankar.

248
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:20,791
Sir, they have called us saying that the Jankar is missing.

249
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:22,000
Oops. I forgot that.

250
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,416
Call them on the phone.

251
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:26,750
Sir, it's ringing.

252
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,250
Will it swear at your dad instead of ringing then?

253
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,750
Hello sir. - Hello!

254
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:33,958
What? - Hey!

255
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:35,708
Ask them to stop playing the drums!

256
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:36,958
If I come there,

257
00:18:37,458 --> 00:18:40,041
I'll throw their Tabor set into the sea. I'm telling you.

258
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,541
Hey! Stop your damn drum beat.

259
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:44,083
It's the SI on the phone.

260
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,416
Sir, they've stopped it. - Sir.

261
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,916
This is not the sea. It's a river.

262
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:50,500
And didn't you say first?

263
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,666
That it's Tabor. It's not Tabor.

264
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,583
It's Nasik Dhol.

265
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:58,666
I think he will get punched by me, before them.

266
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:01,541
Sir, it was docked at the ferry till 9.30 PM last night.

267
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:02,583
After that...

268
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:03,708
Sir...

269
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,416
If it was Bin Laden who died, then it is Obama who killed him.

270
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:08,291
Bin Laden? - Apart from the workers,

271
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:11,708
... if anyone has untied the Jankar's ropes and taken it away in the night,

272
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:14,250
... it must be Lallu, and his warriors.

273
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,583
Lallu and warriors?

274
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:18,750
I got transferred to Taliban or what?

275
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,375
Well, by warriors, he means...

276
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:23,000
there are many wastrels who would even die for Lallu.

277
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,166
So the villagers call them warriors.

278
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:30,166
Who are these wastrels?

279
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:36,916
Sir, they would have taken it to booze on it.

280
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:38,666
Get lost, you upstart!

281
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:42,333
You're mad because you couldn't get your daughter Jesna married to him, right? - What?

282
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,416
Yes. That's the truth.

283
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:46,541
Who are these guys? - Sir...

284
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:48,541
Do you have WhatsApp? - I have WhatsApp.

285
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:52,833
But if you add me to any group without asking me,

286
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:55,500
I'll rip you apart. - Not for that!

287
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,833
I'll send the photos of Lallu his warriors, right now. - That's nice.

288
00:19:59,333 --> 00:19:59,875
Shall I send it to 100?

289
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:00,958
You tortoise!

290
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:04,000
You thought the number of all policemen in Kerala is 100?

291
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,875
Send it to the number I called from. - Okay.

292
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:10,875
Bloody cord!

293
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:14,083
Wikipedia?

294
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:15,125
What's that?

295
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:16,875
Sir, his name is Vicky.

296
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:18,125
His dad has a Peedika (Shop).

297
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:19,958
So everyone calls him Vicky-Peedika.

298
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:23,958
Is that so?

299
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:40,166
Hey! Where are you going? - Stop! - Move.

300
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,250
Calm down. - Leave my hand.

301
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,166
I'm telling you, leave my hand.

302
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:45,541
Leave me, I say.

303
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:48,125
What will you do if we don't? - Leave me.

304
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:49,708
The saviour of ladies.

305
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:53,708
Vicky.

306
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:57,083
Leave my hand.

307
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:58,708
What's the problem? - Get into the car.

308
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:00,041
Leave her. - Who are you to ask that?

309
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:01,958
Let's talk. - Get lost!

310
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:05,958
He wants to talk, it seems!

311
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:25,666
Humerus bone, the most important bone of the human upper body, has been fractured.

312
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:27,500
All the nerves and veins are broken!

313
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
So, you can't even move this hand for the next 3 months.

314
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,291
In short, you've got yourself into some amazing, fantastic and killer trouble.

315
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,833
If that rate is okay, let's go.

316
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:39,583
Then come. Let's go.

317
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:40,833
Get up and go, man!

318
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,666
So this was the case?

319
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:46,791
Oh God!

320
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:49,250
Oh no! Don't do this cruelty to me!

321
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,000
Father, I'll fall at your feet.

322
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,125
Oh no!

323
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,833
I've stopped the alcoholism of much bigger drunkards than you.

324
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:56,916
Dear.. - Here, Father.

325
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:58,291
This is also left. - Oh no!

326
00:21:58,791 --> 00:21:59,750
That's military stuff.

327
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,958
Father, that's military stuff!

328
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:04,208
So be it. - What you're doing is sedition!

329
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:06,000
You have only a motherless daughter.

330
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,666
Shouldn't you live properly, taking care of her? Instead, he's boozing all the time.

331
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:12,250
Hey! God would never forgive all this.

332
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,083
Don't talk like that, Father.

333
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,958
Didn't Jesus serve wine for the wedding at Canada?

334
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:20,500
And not squash or juice, right? - Not Canada, man! Switzerland!

335
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,125
You sad soul, born on Good Friday!

336
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:25,625
I want to see how you will drink today, since it's 1st of this month today.

337
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:27,416
Is today the 1st?

338
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:29,500
You sadist!

339
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,958
I mean, priest!

340
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:33,750
Move! - Oh no!

341
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,208
This Father has defeated me.

342
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:40,208
Not just you. I can defeat even your dad!

343
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:50,041
I drown fish in the water and strangle it to death,

344
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:55,166
and this Father wants to mess with me?

345
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:59,166
Cocktail! Cocktail!

346
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:13,125
What is this? Where were you looking at?

347
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:14,875
Sorry. I am blind.

348
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:17,791
Sorry, Chetta. I didn't know that.

349
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:21,208
That's okay. This is usual for me. - Where do you want to go?

350
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:23,916
I have to go to the other side. I'll go. - No. I'll take you.

351
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:24,958
It's okay. I'll go.

352
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:27,416
No, Chetta. I feel guilty. I'll take you.

353
00:23:27,916 --> 00:23:30,958
Where do you want to go? - I want to cross this road.

354
00:23:31,458 --> 00:23:35,291
Come.

355
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:36,541
Chetta, where to?

356
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:38,083
Did you see a cross there?

357
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:41,958
Yes. - That way.

358
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:43,083
Where?

359
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:45,166
Did you see a transformer there?

360
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:46,875
Stop next to that.

361
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:48,625
Are you going for your job? - No.

362
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:49,750
Yes. Stop me here.

363
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:54,625
Here? - Yes. Here itself.

364
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:56,916
Shucks! This guy! - Hey! Don't go!

365
00:23:57,416 --> 00:23:58,875
I have reservation. Take me to the front.

366
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:02,125
If he's blind, can't he stay at home?

367
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:04,708
Then will your daddy buy booze for me and bring it home?

368
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:08,833
Well, I was asking if you can buy booze for me now.

369
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:12,708
Which one?

370
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:13,875
Long Live 'Soldier'!

371
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:17,875
Oh! You're quite patriotic, huh?

372
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:22,750
Why isn't this loading?

373
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,625
It will be quite difficult for that to load, sir.

374
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:25,916
That's a heavy item.

375
00:24:26,416 --> 00:24:28,041
You'd need extra MBs or GBs.

376
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:30,625
You would have to recharge once again, sir.

377
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:32,791
Who's that heavy item?

378
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:35,041
Kombanayil John sir's son.

379
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:39,041
Lallu!

380
00:25:29,166 --> 00:25:31,291
If I paint one coat of Premiere, and add some texture putty,

381
00:25:31,791 --> 00:25:36,000
do scratch design and get a colour wash done in black gold, it will be awesome.

382
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,125
Altogether, it will cost quite a lot.

383
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:39,666
Hey Lallu!

384
00:25:40,166 --> 00:25:42,625
For your introduction itself, half the money was spent.

385
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:45,166
If you want at least the other half,

386
00:25:45,666 --> 00:25:47,333
go and work, man!

387
00:25:47,833 --> 00:25:51,166
He's planning so much, for a simple white-wash job.

388
00:25:51,666 --> 00:25:54,500
Go on!

389
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,208
Kombanayil John sir's son...

390
00:25:57,708 --> 00:25:58,750
... does a paint job?

391
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,208
He's like that, sir.

392
00:26:00,708 --> 00:26:02,583
There's great variety in everything that he does.

393
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:06,583
He's affected by the nostalgia disease.

394
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,416
Namaste sir. - John sir is here.

395
00:26:15,916 --> 00:26:19,416
Here comes the Jankar.

396
00:26:40,208 --> 00:26:43,708
Turn this side. Don't ruin the punch of the scene.

397
00:26:46,916 --> 00:26:48,625
Buddy...

398
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:51,708
Looks like we're in trouble!

399
00:26:52,208 --> 00:26:56,375
Isn't that my dad over there?

400
00:26:56,875 --> 00:27:00,625
It's easier to brush a lion's teeth with Pepsodent, than facing my dad now.

401
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:01,916
Shall we go to the other shore?

402
00:27:02,416 --> 00:27:03,250
Not just his dad...

403
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:06,958
The villagers have formed an angry mob there!

404
00:27:07,458 --> 00:27:09,083
My boy, only pigs wander as a group.

405
00:27:09,583 --> 00:27:11,083
The lion always goes Solo!

406
00:27:11,583 --> 00:27:14,416
Escape!

407
00:27:14,916 --> 00:27:15,625
Hey! - What's that?

408
00:27:16,125 --> 00:27:17,375
One lion has jumped into the water.

409
00:27:17,875 --> 00:27:19,250
The other lion is blind.

410
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:22,041
And what remains, is a toothless lion.

411
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:23,875
Hey Lallu!

412
00:27:24,375 --> 00:27:28,041
To take the Jankar away for your own pleasure, it's not Kombanayil's property!

413
00:27:28,541 --> 00:27:29,291
Lallu is innocent.

414
00:27:29,791 --> 00:27:33,208
These suicide attackers who are with him, are spoiling him. - No!

415
00:27:33,708 --> 00:27:38,166
I won't allow you to speak a word against my suicide attackers.

416
00:27:38,666 --> 00:27:42,416
My dear people of Kadamakudy, you should listen to this.

417
00:27:42,916 --> 00:27:46,916
Trapped in the thunderstorm last night, like a loose kite,

418
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:50,625
this Jankar floated via Pizhala, Kothadu, Kadamakudy, Chaliyam island,

419
00:27:51,125 --> 00:27:54,791
all the way to Vallarpadam container terminal...

420
00:27:55,291 --> 00:27:58,541
Mortgaging my own life and my friends' life at Muthoott finance,

421
00:27:59,041 --> 00:28:03,041
swimming up like Usain Bolt, through the torrential currents of the river,

422
00:28:03,541 --> 00:28:05,041
and then tying the Jankar up,

423
00:28:05,541 --> 00:28:10,250
then floating endlessly through the wind rain, with the expertise of a Captain,

424
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,541
we brought it to the shore risking our lives.

425
00:28:13,041 --> 00:28:15,083
Tell me. This Lallu and my warriors, have we done a crime?

426
00:28:15,583 --> 00:28:17,041
Tell me. Have we?

427
00:28:17,541 --> 00:28:18,625
No!

428
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:20,166
No!

429
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:24,500
No! - Yes.

430
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,500
Come on, clap!

431
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:32,958
You losers! - Yes. Are you guys crazy?

432
00:28:33,458 --> 00:28:36,791
He's fooling all of you.

433
00:28:37,291 --> 00:28:37,833
Mom!

434
00:28:38,333 --> 00:28:39,291
Dude, are you leaving today? - Yes.

435
00:28:39,791 --> 00:28:41,291
So you do remember that, huh?

436
00:28:41,791 --> 00:28:42,791
Daddy gave me a credit card.

437
00:28:43,291 --> 00:28:45,625
Mummy gave a great gift. Aren't you giving me anything?

438
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:49,458
What do I give you now?

439
00:28:49,958 --> 00:28:52,541
Not this.

440
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:55,833
This is nice.

441
00:28:56,333 --> 00:28:57,375
Here. Keep this.

442
00:28:57,875 --> 00:28:58,416
What is this?

443
00:28:58,916 --> 00:28:59,541
A whistle? - Yes.

444
00:29:00,041 --> 00:29:02,333
I cried and fell at the feet of a soldier to get it.

445
00:29:02,833 --> 00:29:07,416
He's not going for a security guard's job at Bangalore, with this lame whistle.

446
00:29:07,916 --> 00:29:08,958
Shall I leave, mom? - Okay.

447
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:11,583
Why are you sending him for a job to Bangalore, feeling so sad?

448
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:16,541
I told him long back to come for a paint job with Panchykkuttan.

449
00:29:17,041 --> 00:29:19,041
Come! Come! - Don't be sad, mom!

450
00:29:19,541 --> 00:29:21,791
Bye.

451
00:29:22,291 --> 00:29:24,166
Why am I not reaching the shore? - Come! Come, swimming.

452
00:29:24,666 --> 00:29:28,083
Oh no! Escape! - Don't worry. Come on up!

453
00:29:28,583 --> 00:29:31,208
You came swimming, because there's no Jankar, right?

454
00:29:31,708 --> 00:29:34,291
You don't need so much sincerity to go for work, man.

455
00:29:34,791 --> 00:29:36,125
I have seen you somewhere!

456
00:29:36,625 --> 00:29:38,125
I'm seeing you for the first time, sir.

457
00:29:38,625 --> 00:29:40,000
What a nice young man, right? - Of course.

458
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,500
Any mason would be lucky to get him as a worker.

459
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,500
Mega Painting Event, led by Panjikkuttan.

460
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,583
Boss! - Don't make noise, Kattappa.

461
00:30:13,083 --> 00:30:16,208
They said that you won't be coming here, and you'd be going to Ernakulam!

462
00:30:16,708 --> 00:30:17,375
Yes!

463
00:30:17,875 --> 00:30:20,458
This was my psychological move to check

464
00:30:20,958 --> 00:30:22,666
whether you all are working while I'm not here. Understood?

465
00:30:23,166 --> 00:30:25,041
You are a genius, boss!

466
00:30:25,541 --> 00:30:26,458
Hey!

467
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:30,291
Instead of stirring me, stir that bucket, man!

468
00:30:30,791 --> 00:30:34,500
Bloody Biriyani-head!

469
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,416
Come on! Oh no!

470
00:30:36,916 --> 00:30:37,625
The joker didn't come.

471
00:30:38,125 --> 00:30:38,916
Shall I come instead?

472
00:30:39,416 --> 00:30:40,333
Oh no! Oh no!

473
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:42,333
No! I'll play without the joker.

474
00:30:42,833 --> 00:30:44,291
My darling... Where are you?

475
00:30:44,791 --> 00:30:47,083
Give me a kiss.

476
00:30:47,583 --> 00:30:49,583
Not like that.

477
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:51,708
Muah. Like that.

478
00:30:52,208 --> 00:30:53,333
Gone? Give me a kiss and go!

479
00:30:53,833 --> 00:30:55,875
Is it okay if I give it?

480
00:30:56,375 --> 00:30:57,458
Will your thirst be quenched with that?

481
00:30:57,958 --> 00:30:59,791
Tell me, you Gulab Jamun!

482
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:03,791
Do your work, man!

483
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:10,041
You needn't come for work from tomorrow. - But I didn't do anything!

484
00:31:10,541 --> 00:31:11,041
Yes.

485
00:31:11,541 --> 00:31:12,708
You're not doing anything!

486
00:31:13,208 --> 00:31:15,083
Why should I pay you then?

487
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:17,291
If it goes on like this, what should I do?

488
00:31:17,791 --> 00:31:21,125
Is there anyone who's working here?

489
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:22,958
Oh my God! - There, he is working!

490
00:31:23,458 --> 00:31:25,916
At least there's one guy, who's working sincerely.

491
00:31:26,416 --> 00:31:29,916
Let me compliment him.

492
00:31:33,833 --> 00:31:35,791
What is this?

493
00:31:36,291 --> 00:31:40,666
Adi Sankaracharya's footsteps?

494
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:42,333
Well, this is a Christian's house, right?

495
00:31:42,833 --> 00:31:44,708
I intended to draw St. Thomas' footsteps.

496
00:31:45,208 --> 00:31:50,125
Do you intend to imprint this house owner's footsteps on my chest?

497
00:31:50,625 --> 00:31:51,375
Don't work! - Thanks a lot.

498
00:31:51,875 --> 00:31:53,291
None of you have to work here. - Awesome!

499
00:31:53,791 --> 00:31:54,916
Aarggh!!

500
00:31:55,416 --> 00:31:57,666
You want to get me bankrupt or what?

501
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,041
Only we should work or what?

502
00:31:59,541 --> 00:32:00,750
Lallu is reading a comic book over there.

503
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:02,583
Hey Kurkure-face!

504
00:32:03,083 --> 00:32:05,416
We're getting these jobs, just because we have him with us.

505
00:32:05,916 --> 00:32:09,250
But didn't you say that we're getting these troubles because of me?

506
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:13,958
Please don't remind me about those troubles!

507
00:32:14,458 --> 00:32:15,458
Him, Lallu...

508
00:32:15,958 --> 00:32:21,041
He's referring the comic book to paint the kids' room.

509
00:32:21,541 --> 00:32:25,041
Oh no!

510
00:32:26,583 --> 00:32:27,916
This Soothran his tricks!

511
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,416
Hey Lallu...

512
00:32:29,916 --> 00:32:32,666
What did you say you would draw in the kids' room today?

513
00:32:33,166 --> 00:32:35,458
'Mayavi'. - And after reading the comic book here,

514
00:32:35,958 --> 00:32:38,833
if you say 'Abracadabra', would Mayavi appear on the wall?

515
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:40,541
Go and work, man!

516
00:32:41,041 --> 00:32:44,541
What is this, then?

517
00:32:55,333 --> 00:32:56,833
Pure delight!

518
00:32:57,333 --> 00:32:58,333
That is Lallu.

519
00:32:58,833 --> 00:33:00,833
Well, if you draw this, you think your work is over?

520
00:33:01,333 --> 00:33:02,750
Why don't you do the texture work?

521
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,291
Panjikkutta, those misers are not giving me extra paint.

522
00:33:05,791 --> 00:33:08,166
If they're not giving you extra, I'll give you extra paint.

523
00:33:08,666 --> 00:33:10,750
Will you give extra? - Why should I have a problem? I will.

524
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:13,166
Will you? - I will give you extra!

525
00:33:13,666 --> 00:33:14,458
Panjikkutta! - Yes.

526
00:33:14,958 --> 00:33:16,708
If it's a decent girl, can you set her up for me too?

527
00:33:17,208 --> 00:33:18,416
Bhel Puri-face! Get lost!

528
00:33:18,916 --> 00:33:19,750
Go and work!

529
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,916
Go!

530
00:33:22,416 --> 00:33:22,958
Did Tenny call you?

531

For the attention of all the brush operators,

00:33:40,416 --> 00:33:43,958
there is only a week's time for the house-warming of this house.

I'll get good money and piles of food!

711
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:25,250
Piles of food? - No.

712
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:26,916
Piles of money and good food.

713
00:42:27,416 --> 00:42:29,416
It's risky to go sing on a boat. - Why?

714
00:42:29,916 --> 00:42:32,333
If your song flops at the middle of the lake, where will you run?

715
00:42:32,833 --> 00:42:33,583
That's true.

716
00:42:34,083 --> 00:42:35,083
I am blind, right?

717
00:42:35,583 --> 00:42:37,166
No use.

718
00:42:37,666 --> 00:42:38,833
My eyes were already like this.

719
00:42:39,333 --> 00:42:43,083
If at least he had sight, would I have to work hard in the hot sun like this?

720
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,791
Don't be all senti now.

721
00:42:45,291 --> 00:42:47,166
So what if my son doesn't have sight?

722
00:42:47,666 --> 00:42:50,083
God has given him the talent to sing, right?

723
00:42:50,583 --> 00:42:52,375
Giving him sight would have been better.

724
00:42:52,875 --> 00:42:54,541
Well, it's good that at least you have sight, aunty.

725
00:42:55,041 --> 00:42:57,708
Otherwise, blind people would be bumping into each other in this house.

726
00:42:58,208 --> 00:42:58,791
Get lost!

727
00:42:59,291 --> 00:43:01,541
Mom having sight is actually a loss for us.

728
00:43:02,041 --> 00:43:04,458
Because we had to get electricity here, just for mom, right?

729
00:43:04,958 --> 00:43:05,583
Come. Let's go.

730
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:06,916
And yeah, Lallu...

731
00:43:07,416 --> 00:43:09,958
Don't buy chilly powder from Gopi's shop to your house.

732
00:43:10,458 --> 00:43:11,583
It's full of chemicals!

733
00:43:12,083 --> 00:43:13,041
Didn't you leave that yet?

734
00:43:13,541 --> 00:43:14,500
So, Omana Kutti. - What?

735
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
He means O-K.

736
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,791
Son, be careful. It's dark outside.

737
00:43:19,291 --> 00:43:21,458
As if it's lit like a cricket stadium, all the time for me.

738
00:43:21,958 --> 00:43:22,625
Dude...

739
00:43:23,125 --> 00:43:24,250
I don't like to follow you.

740
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:26,333
I'd like to walk beside you.

741
00:43:26,833 --> 00:43:27,708
Otherwise you'd fall flat on your face, right?

742
00:43:28,208 --> 00:43:30,375
Hold this. - You hold it.

743
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:34,375
Careful.

744
00:43:37,458 --> 00:43:40,083
Don't make noise.

745
00:43:40,583 --> 00:43:42,375
Is it time? - There are 5 more minutes.

746
00:43:42,875 --> 00:43:45,041
Hey! Check if there are any CCTV cameras installed!

747
00:43:45,541 --> 00:43:47,708
He has installed it in the bathroom of the neighbouring house.

748
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:50,416
How's that useful for me?

749
00:43:50,916 --> 00:43:52,916
Can any neighbour spot us?

750
00:43:53,416 --> 00:43:54,208
What's the time?

751
00:43:54,708 --> 00:43:56,791
Let me check.

752
00:43:57,291 --> 00:43:58,708
It's time. It's 12 o'clock. - Light it.

753
00:43:59,208 --> 00:44:00,916
It's time, man!

754
00:44:01,416 --> 00:44:02,000
This is not lighting.

755
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,916
Oh no!

756
00:44:04,416 --> 00:44:05,916
'Birthday wishes, Vicky-Peedika' Hurry up, it's time.

757
00:44:06,416 --> 00:44:07,375
Keep quiet. - It's time.

758
00:44:07,875 --> 00:44:09,250
Wait.

759
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:13,333
Give one to him.

760
00:44:13,833 --> 00:44:15,708
Keep one over here.

761
00:44:16,208 --> 00:44:18,416
Are you ready? - Ready!

762
00:44:18,916 --> 00:44:20,166
Ready... 1 ... 2....

763
00:44:20,666 --> 00:44:24,166
3...!!!

764
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:34,250
Bathe him in froth!

765
00:44:40,583 --> 00:44:41,958
Stop it. - Happy birthday!

766
00:44:42,458 --> 00:44:43,791
Happy birthday!

767
00:44:44,291 --> 00:44:44,916
Happy birthday?

768
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:46,708
Whose birthday? - Your birthday.

769
00:44:47,208 --> 00:44:49,708
My birthday is not today.

770
00:44:50,208 --> 00:44:52,458
Well, Facebook says that it's today.

771
00:44:52,958 --> 00:44:54,666
Today is not my birthday!

772
00:44:55,166 --> 00:44:57,208
But that's how it is on Facebook. - Today is not my birthday!

773
00:44:57,708 --> 00:45:00,250
What about the notification on Facebook?

774
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:04,250
Did Facebook give birth to him, or me?

775
00:45:08,125 --> 00:45:08,708
It's mom.

776
00:45:09,208 --> 00:45:12,708
Right, dad?

777
00:45:14,291 --> 00:45:17,791
Point.

778
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,750
I had told these guys back then itself.

779
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:25,375
That none of this would work.

780
00:45:25,875 --> 00:45:27,791
What atrocity have you done?

781
00:45:28,291 --> 00:45:32,208
Is this something that you do to a family barging into their house at midnight?

782
00:45:32,708 --> 00:45:35,833
Don't ever repeat it. All of you leave.

783
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:38,416
Go! You go to sleep.

784
00:45:38,916 --> 00:45:40,625
Well, should I tell you specially?

785
00:45:41,125 --> 00:45:41,916
Go! Go!

786
00:45:42,416 --> 00:45:43,333
Go to sleep!

787
00:45:43,833 --> 00:45:46,000
Hey Panji...!!

788
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:49,125
Didn't you study together with my dad?

789
00:45:49,625 --> 00:45:52,583
Why are you spoiling the lives of these boys?

790
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,333
Just for fun. - Hey!

791
00:45:54,833 --> 00:45:58,250
You better clean the house before you leave. You heard me?

792
00:45:58,750 --> 00:45:59,666
Heard it?

793
00:46:00,166 --> 00:46:02,333
We should leave only after cleaning.

794
00:46:02,833 --> 00:46:03,333
Ask if there's a broom.

795
00:46:03,833 --> 00:46:05,708
It's at the corner.

796
00:46:06,208 --> 00:46:09,708
At the corner?

797
00:46:10,875 --> 00:46:14,375
What is this, man?

798
00:46:16,166 --> 00:46:17,375
Shucks.

799
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:18,666
What can you see over there?

800
00:46:19,166 --> 00:46:21,333
Go and sit there.

801
00:46:21,833 --> 00:46:22,916
Here. Under my leg.

802
00:46:23,416 --> 00:46:26,958
Over there.

803
00:46:27,458 --> 00:46:31,458
Move.

804
00:46:31,958 --> 00:46:33,625
Uncle, we've cleared everything.

805
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:37,625
Not even a bit is on the floor.

806
00:46:39,333 --> 00:46:42,708
You....!!!

807
00:46:43,208 --> 00:46:44,041
What happened?

808
00:46:44,541 --> 00:46:45,833
All of you get out!

809
00:46:46,333 --> 00:46:47,583
Should I also go?

810
00:46:48,083 --> 00:46:50,083
Hey! Stop!

811
00:46:50,583 --> 00:46:51,916
We didn't come to destroy your house.

812
00:46:52,416 --> 00:46:55,708
We came with a birthday cake at midnight because we're fond of your son.

813
00:46:56,208 --> 00:46:58,041
But this was humiliating.

814
00:46:58,541 --> 00:46:59,500
Hey Vicky!

815
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,791
None of us will ever step into this house again.

816
00:47:02,291 --> 00:47:04,916
Come!

817
00:47:05,416 --> 00:47:06,083
Come.

818
00:47:06,583 --> 00:47:10,750
The punch dialogue was awesome.

819
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:14,375
Mom had asked me to take an umbrella.

820
00:47:14,875 --> 00:47:18,375
Vicky, do you have an umbrella here? - No.

821
00:47:18,875 --> 00:47:19,708
Sigh!

822
00:47:20,208 --> 00:47:21,833
I knew it when you were playing on the mobile in the bus,

823
00:47:22,333 --> 00:47:22,916
that it will run out of charge.

824
00:47:23,416 --> 00:47:24,125
How will we call Uncle now?

825
00:47:24,625 --> 00:47:26,083
- We could have reached for the interview even if we left tomorrow morning.

826
00:47:26,583 --> 00:47:27,250
You were adamant that we should leave today!

827
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:30,333
If we don't go to uncle's house after coming here, Rosammachi won't spare us.

828
00:47:30,833 --> 00:47:34,333
Yeah right. Rosammachi!

829
00:47:56,666 --> 00:47:57,291
You didn't wipe your head.

830
00:47:57,791 --> 00:48:01,291
Come. You'll catch a fever.

831
00:48:49,208 --> 00:48:50,708
Who is this chick?

832
00:48:51,208 --> 00:48:52,666
Chetta, this is my mother. - Mother?

833
00:48:53,166 --> 00:48:53,833
Mother?

834
00:48:54,333 --> 00:48:55,583
Then I am your daddy!

835
00:48:56,083 --> 00:48:56,958
Move, son.

836
00:48:57,458 --> 00:48:59,708
Let daddy take a good look at this mommy.

837
00:49:00,208 --> 00:49:00,708
Chetta. - Sit down.

838
00:49:01,208 --> 00:49:03,250
Leave him. What are you doing?

839
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:05,083
Sit there. - Keep calm.

840
00:49:05,583 --> 00:49:07,583
Chetta, don't hurt us. - Mom son roaming around at midnight?

841
00:49:08,083 --> 00:49:09,541
Chetta, please let us go.

842
00:49:10,041 --> 00:49:12,625
Shut up! - Chetta, don't do this.

843
00:49:13,125 --> 00:49:14,125
Don't do this, children.

844
00:49:14,625 --> 00:49:16,500
Mom and son are roaming around at midnight? Yeah right!

845
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,291
Leave us. - Record it fully, dude.

846
00:49:18,791 --> 00:49:22,750
Let's put it on Facebook, and make it viral.

847
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:26,750
Chetta, please tell him.

848
00:49:29,875 --> 00:49:31,666
Son, ask them to leave him.

849
00:49:32,166 --> 00:49:33,708
Don't you also have a mother like this at home?

850
00:49:34,208 --> 00:49:34,833
Please.

851
00:49:35,333 --> 00:49:38,750
Please!

852
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:42,500
At least for your mother's sake, please tell them.

853
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,375
- 'You don't look anything like your dad!'

854
00:49:44,875 --> 00:49:46,500
- 'Can't you see? He's Rajan's son'

855
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:47,541
- 'Davis! Son!'

856
00:49:48,041 --> 00:49:51,666
- 'Mom!'

857
00:49:52,166 --> 00:49:53,708
- 'Tell your mom that I asked for her'

858
00:49:54,208 --> 00:49:55,625
I swear, I am his mother.

859
00:49:56,125 --> 00:50:00,125
- 'Who is your actual father?'

860
00:50:00,625 --> 00:50:04,125
Mom! Mom!

861
00:50:08,291 --> 00:50:09,125
Dude!

862
00:50:09,625 --> 00:50:12,208
Look! She has gone with a boy, betraying her husband.

863
00:50:12,708 --> 00:50:13,250
Where?

864
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:15,541
People like her should be shot dead.

865
00:50:16,041 --> 00:50:17,250
Share it, dude.

866
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:19,833
Can't you go and die, you b@$@#?

867
00:50:20,333 --> 00:50:24,541
Let me see. - What is it, Chetta?

868
00:50:25,041 --> 00:50:26,250
I told you not to shout.

869
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:28,250
Here. I'll give you!

870
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:29,333
Who didn't get it?

871
00:50:29,833 --> 00:50:31,791
I didn't get it. - Here. For you.

872
00:50:32,291 --> 00:50:35,791
Phew! Oh my God!

873
00:50:39,416 --> 00:50:42,916
Well, who is this?

874
00:50:46,791 --> 00:50:48,083
My elder son.

875
00:50:48,583 --> 00:50:50,541
Lallu.

876
00:50:51,041 --> 00:50:51,916
This...

877
00:50:52,416 --> 00:50:55,000
These are the parents relatives of Tanya, who works with Pappi.

878
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:56,125
What do you do?

879
00:50:56,625 --> 00:50:57,500
Painting. - Wow!

880
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:58,791
You're an artist?

881
00:50:59,291 --> 00:51:01,375
You must be coming after clay modelling.

882
00:51:01,875 --> 00:51:03,291
Sheesh! Not that.

883
00:51:03,791 --> 00:51:06,500
This is the painting that we do hanging on ropes, on 10 storey buildings.

884
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:07,666
750 Rupees daily wage.

885
00:51:08,166 --> 00:51:11,750
That painting.

886
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:15,458
That was his desire. That's why.

887
00:51:15,958 --> 00:51:16,541
Painting?

888
00:51:17,041 --> 00:51:18,416
Sheesh. - Why are you saying sheesh?

889
00:51:18,916 --> 00:51:21,916
Well, a painting job is like...

890
00:51:22,416 --> 00:51:24,625
Painting is not such a bad job, unlike what you think.

891
00:51:25,125 --> 00:51:27,083
Daily wage jobs like painting, carpentry and quarry jobs

892
00:51:27,583 --> 00:51:29,875
are the most fun jobs in the world.

893
00:51:30,375 --> 00:51:30,916
That means...

894
00:51:31,416 --> 00:51:33,375
We don't have to go early in the morning.

895
00:51:33,875 --> 00:51:35,583
We can have a good sleep, bathe and get ready,

896
00:51:36,083 --> 00:51:37,458
and reach the site by 8.30 - 9 AM.

897
00:51:37,958 --> 00:51:40,083
And slowly we would change into our working clothes,

898
00:51:40,583 --> 00:51:42,875
we'll take the paint can, make some noise, stir it a couple of times,

899
00:51:43,375 --> 00:51:45,166
and by the time we brush it to both sides,

900
00:51:45,666 --> 00:51:46,250
it will be time for tea.

901
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:49,958
10 AM.

902
00:51:50,458 --> 00:51:52,833
Then all of us have a chat and go to drink tea.

903
00:51:53,333 --> 00:51:56,250
After having some strong hot tea, and crisp onion snacks,

904
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:59,125
we'll come back, talk on the phone for a while, take a ladder,

905
00:51:59,625 --> 00:52:02,250
and by the time we get on it, and brush it to either sides,

906
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:03,625
it would be time for lunch.

907
00:52:04,125 --> 00:52:05,500
1 PM.

908
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,166
Then everyone would make a circle like this, and sit.

909
00:52:08,666 --> 00:52:11,708
Everyone can eat many curries made in many kitchens, from each other's plates.

910
00:52:12,208 --> 00:52:13,708
This is where actual socialism happens.

911
00:52:14,208 --> 00:52:16,958
We bring a green banana leaf, apply salt and oil on it,

912
00:52:17,458 --> 00:52:19,875
and bring rice and curry covered in it.

913
00:52:20,375 --> 00:52:22,791
There's a fragrance that comes when it's opened.

914
00:52:23,291 --> 00:52:24,791
Mango pickle on the side, stir fried vegetables at the centre.

915
00:52:25,291 --> 00:52:27,625
On this side, two sardine fries. Wow!

916
00:52:28,125 --> 00:52:30,500
After having this, and listening to film songs on All India Radio,

917
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,750
we lay newspapers on the floor and sleep on them.

918
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:35,083
That is heaven!

919
00:52:35,583 --> 00:52:40,208
Then after 2 PM, by the time we scrub the bars, and brush the walls, it will be 4 PM.

920
00:52:40,708 --> 00:52:41,833
Tea time.

921
00:52:42,333 --> 00:52:44,083
After that, we rub off the paint from the brush with turpentine,

922
00:52:44,583 --> 00:52:47,458
we wash our hands legs with soap, apply oil and comb our hair,

923
00:52:47,958 --> 00:52:49,583
and when we stretch our hands in front of the mason,

924
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:52,000
we'll get our 750 Rupees daily wage immediately.

925
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:53,958
But none of this is the best part.

926
00:52:54,458 --> 00:52:56,208
By finishing the work in the house, within the specified time,

927
00:52:56,708 --> 00:52:58,791
when we hand over the key of the house to the owner,

928
00:52:59,291 --> 00:53:04,583
the shine of that new house brings a smile on his face!

929
00:53:05,083 --> 00:53:08,583
Pure delight!

930
00:53:11,166 --> 00:53:14,083
I should have gone for a painting job!

931
00:53:14,583 --> 00:53:15,375
Mr. John...

932
00:53:15,875 --> 00:53:19,375
Please come.

933
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,541
Tanya is my only daughter.

934
00:53:24,041 --> 00:53:26,000
I've never opposed any wish of hers.

935
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:28,041
I don't have any objection in Pappi's case either.

936
00:53:28,541 --> 00:53:32,125
But to get the younger brother married when the elder one is yet to marry,

937
00:53:32,625 --> 00:53:33,791
it's not fit for good families.

938
00:53:34,291 --> 00:53:35,166
So...

939
00:53:35,666 --> 00:53:36,208
That guy...

940
00:53:36,708 --> 00:53:38,208
Lulu or Lalu.. Whatever it is...

941
00:53:38,708 --> 00:53:39,791
Let him get married first.

942
00:53:40,291 --> 00:53:42,708
We'll think about this after that. Fine?

943
00:53:43,208 --> 00:53:48,666
Understood? Understood? That Panjikkuttan hasn't understood that till date.

944
00:53:49,166 --> 00:53:49,916
Shall we leave then?

945
00:53:50,416 --> 00:53:52,750
Okay.

946
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:56,208
Lallu, see you later.

947
00:53:56,708 --> 00:53:59,375
Lallu, please recommend me to Panjikkuttan...

948
00:53:59,875 --> 00:54:00,416
That's Omana Kutti!

949
00:54:00,916 --> 00:54:01,708
Who?

950
00:54:02,208 --> 00:54:04,416
O-K. - Oh Okay!

951
00:54:04,916 --> 00:54:06,208
Okay. What a smart chap!

952
00:54:06,708 --> 00:54:10,083
Isn't he? - No mixture?

953
00:54:10,583 --> 00:54:12,375
Lallu...

954
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:15,541
What is it, dad?

955
00:54:16,041 --> 00:54:18,375
Aren't you getting married?

956
00:54:18,875 --> 00:54:22,875
I heard that you didn't like Palai Kuriyachan's daughter?

957
00:54:23,375 --> 00:54:25,416
All this while, you lived life as you wanted.

958
00:54:25,916 --> 00:54:26,750
But Pappi is not like that.

959
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:29,458
He has never asked us for anything.

960
00:54:29,958 --> 00:54:31,916
This is the first time he's expressing a wish.

961
00:54:32,416 --> 00:54:33,666
I must fulfill it.

962
00:54:34,166 --> 00:54:35,333
You shouldn't be a hindrance to it.

963
00:54:35,833 --> 00:54:39,000
I mean, you should get married, at the earliest.

964
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:39,916
Dad...

965
00:54:40,416 --> 00:54:42,791
As soon as I get a spark.. - Spark! Damn it!

966
00:54:43,291 --> 00:54:44,375
I've been hearing this for a long time!

967
00:54:44,875 --> 00:54:46,625
You don't like any girl whom we find for you.

968
00:54:47,125 --> 00:54:48,958
You will only have a love marriage. Agreed!

969
00:54:49,458 --> 00:54:52,250
But I won't let you delay it any further, looking for a spark!

970
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:58,041
I won't let your brother's life to be ruined, because of your recklessness.

971
00:54:58,541 --> 00:55:00,041
Dad...

972
00:55:00,541 --> 00:55:01,750
Dad! - What is it?

973
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:05,666
Give company to this mango-nut.

974
00:55:06,166 --> 00:55:09,750
Let me see if I can get him married.

975
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:12,333
Hey! Don't cut your hair.

976
00:55:12,833 --> 00:55:14,958
Josephetta!

977
00:55:15,458 --> 00:55:16,333
Which among this is the bait?

978
00:55:16,833 --> 00:55:17,458
Get lost, man!

979
00:55:17,958 --> 00:55:19,708
I'd die the day he gets a fish on his bait.

980
00:55:20,208 --> 00:55:21,083
Coming for work?

981
00:55:21,583 --> 00:55:23,375
Lallu, you can swear at our mothers.

982
00:55:23,875 --> 00:55:24,625
But don't call us for work.

983
00:55:25,125 --> 00:55:26,791
It's equal to insulting us. - Shall we hit him?

984
00:55:27,291 --> 00:55:29,708
No. That's too much effort. - Okay, Chetta.

985
00:55:30,208 --> 00:55:31,916
Dude, that moral policing case?

986
00:55:32,416 --> 00:55:34,250
It was a mother and son, apparently. - Oh no!

987
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:36,625
That boy committed suicide.

988
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:38,083
What kind of people are these?

989
00:55:38,583 --> 00:55:40,000
Let me put up a post now.

990
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:43,083
Caption - 'Hang your head in shame, Kerala'

991
00:55:43,583 --> 00:55:46,166
That will be awesome. - Feeling heartbroken.

992
00:55:46,666 --> 00:55:47,500
Did you get it? - No. Here.

993
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:48,750
Lallu is here!

994
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:51,666
Nice! All of you are so colourful today!

995
00:55:52,166 --> 00:55:55,000
Happy Independence Day! - Great.

996
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:58,166
We're celebrating because we chased the English-men away from here.

997
00:55:58,666 --> 00:55:59,916
So, don't say 'Happy independence day'.

998
00:56:00,416 --> 00:56:02,333
Say it in our language. 'Swathanthrya dinaashamsagal'.

999
00:56:02,833 --> 00:56:03,375
How?

1000
00:56:03,875 --> 00:56:05,250
You have to pay fine if you speak in Malayalam in your school, right?

1001
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:06,791
Here. Take this sweet.

1002
00:56:07,291 --> 00:56:08,041
Lallu...

1003
00:56:08,541 --> 00:56:13,125
Jesna is coming. - Oh no.

1004
00:56:13,625 --> 00:56:14,500
Move.

1005
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:15,875
What is it?

1006
00:56:16,375 --> 00:56:18,791
Stand closer. - Why?

1007
00:56:19,291 --> 00:56:20,208
Oh! Jesna is coming, huh?

1008
00:56:20,708 --> 00:56:24,208
Stand closer, man! - Now she won't see you.

1009
00:56:27,125 --> 00:56:31,416
Nice breeze, right?

1010
00:56:31,916 --> 00:56:33,500
That girl in blue Churidar, is for this Vicky.

1011
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,833
Go fast, you idiot. The Jankar will leave now.

1012
00:56:36,333 --> 00:56:38,125
Shut up, you old grandpa!

1013
00:56:38,625 --> 00:56:42,125
The punch is when I run and jump into the jankar once it leaves the dock.

1014
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,291
Come back!

1015
00:56:50,791 --> 00:56:51,333
He went into the water.

1016
00:56:51,833 --> 00:56:52,583
Who? - Vicky. - Over there.

1017
00:56:53,083 --> 00:56:54,166
This little devil.

1018
00:56:54,666 --> 00:56:58,166
Hey!

1019
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:02,458
Lallu.. - Don't do things that you can't.

1020
00:57:02,958 --> 00:57:04,083
Lallu!

1021
00:57:04,583 --> 00:57:05,250
Check if there's fish in your pocket.

1022
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:06,625
Lallu!

1023
00:57:07,125 --> 00:57:08,291
I tried jumping on to this.

1024
00:57:08,791 --> 00:57:11,916
Any hope in our case?

1025
00:57:12,416 --> 00:57:12,958
Brother!

1026
00:57:13,458 --> 00:57:17,041
Even now?

1027
00:57:17,541 --> 00:57:18,458
Don't laugh.

1028
00:57:18,958 --> 00:57:20,541
All of you were after him, right?

1029
00:57:21,041 --> 00:57:23,208
Then when he asked you all to consider him as a brother,

1030
00:57:23,708 --> 00:57:25,291
all of you left it immediately.

1031
00:57:25,791 --> 00:57:27,250
Since my love is sincere,

1032
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:29,083
I am still after him.

1033
00:57:29,583 --> 00:57:30,208
Then...

1034
00:57:30,708 --> 00:57:32,125
That spark that he talks about?

1035
00:57:32,625 --> 00:57:35,625
He'll feel that for me, sooner or later.

1036
00:57:36,125 --> 00:57:36,708
Wait and watch.

1037
00:57:37,208 --> 00:57:39,083
Dude, girls are looking. They would see.

1038
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:41,208
Only I saw it.

1039
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:42,541
Nice cotton Sari.

1040
00:57:43,041 --> 00:57:43,666
What are you doing?

1041
00:57:44,166 --> 00:57:45,875
I was wiping my head. - Nothing, chechi.

1042
00:57:46,375 --> 00:57:46,916
Sweetheart!

1043
00:57:47,416 --> 00:57:48,000
Did you have yum-yum?

1044
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:50,333
Not yum-yum. Food.

1045
00:57:50,833 --> 00:57:52,250
He was a scholar, huh? - You're such an idiot, Lallu.

1046
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:54,333
Didn't you hear that? Is he your son? - Yes.

1047
00:57:54,833 --> 00:57:58,333
No match at all. - Get lost!

1048
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:02,750
Shucks!

1049
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:03,916
It's a block.

1050
00:58:04,416 --> 00:58:05,541
Traffic block is not a problem.

1051
00:58:06,041 --> 00:58:07,666
Even if the heart has a block, there's no problem.

1052
00:58:08,166 --> 00:58:11,666
But if girls block me on WhatsApp, I'll be heartbroken.

1053
00:58:16,083 --> 00:58:17,583
Dude...

1054
00:58:18,083 --> 00:58:18,625
Isn't that you?

1055
00:58:19,125 --> 00:58:21,041
What? - Tell me the truth.

1056
00:58:21,541 --> 00:58:23,041
Isn't that you?

1057
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:24,958
What?

1058
00:58:25,458 --> 00:58:28,500
The funny guy who sends jokes to local magazines?

1059
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:29,958
I don't send it.

1060
00:58:30,458 --> 00:58:31,958
Just that whatever I say becomes a hit luckily.

1061
00:58:32,458 --> 00:58:33,541
I don't send it.

1062
00:58:34,041 --> 00:58:35,208
Was it too classy?

1063
00:58:35,708 --> 00:58:38,791
If you ever make such lame jokes....

1064
00:58:39,291 --> 00:58:42,791
one...

1065
00:58:54,208 --> 00:58:57,250
What is he doing?

1066
00:58:57,750 --> 00:58:59,125
Where the hell are you going?

1067
00:58:59,625 --> 00:59:00,791
Where are you stuffing it into?

1068
00:59:01,291 --> 00:59:03,166
Can't you see the vehicles stuck here in this block?

1069
00:59:03,666 --> 00:59:04,333
Bloody...

1070
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:07,708
He's going as if he has to buy medicines for his mother.

1071
00:59:08,208 --> 00:59:08,791
His mother's damn...

1072
00:59:09,291 --> 00:59:12,791
I'm trying to control the cuss words coming out of my mouth.

1073
00:59:20,666 --> 00:59:24,166
What is he doing?

1074
00:59:31,416 --> 00:59:34,916
You...!!

1075
00:59:44,583 --> 00:59:48,208
Leave me!

1076
00:59:48,708 --> 00:59:49,916
- 'Davis!'

1077
00:59:50,416 --> 00:59:51,208
- 'Son!'

1078
00:59:51,708 --> 00:59:56,208
- 'Tell your mom that I asked for her'

1079
00:59:56,708 --> 00:59:58,208
Dude, can you give me that one? You take this.

1080
00:59:58,708 --> 00:59:59,916
Get lost. I specially asked for this one.

1081
01:00:00,416 --> 01:00:02,208
Sigh! He had only one of that.

1082
01:00:02,708 --> 01:00:04,166
What block is this!

1083
01:00:04,666 --> 01:00:06,375
Shall we ask him? Chetta!

1084
01:00:06,875 --> 01:00:07,708
What happened over there?

1085
01:00:08,208 --> 01:00:09,541
They stuffed that car in between,

1086
01:00:10,041 --> 01:00:12,333
and some guy is beating up a poor guy.

1087
01:00:12,833 --> 01:00:16,333
Troubling people in vain!

1088
01:00:37,708 --> 01:00:37,958
Yes!

1089
01:00:38,458 --> 01:00:40,166
Kunjatta, I don't think this block would clear anytime soon.

1090
01:00:40,666 --> 01:00:42,791
Let's turn go back and go via Kombara. I have to go to a house there.

1091
01:00:43,291 --> 01:00:44,083
We needn't be stuck here.

1092
01:00:44,583 --> 01:00:45,333
Then get in.

1093
01:00:45,833 --> 01:00:47,375
Aren't you going to hit them? - Why?

1094
01:00:47,875 --> 01:00:49,458
I thew my ice cream away seeing this.

1095
01:00:49,958 --> 01:00:53,125
To interfere in this random fight that they started, did he swear at my mom?

1096
01:00:53,625 --> 01:00:55,041
If he swore at your mom, would you hit him? - Yes.

1097
01:00:55,541 --> 01:00:57,041
If he swears at my mom, I'll hit him, whoever he is.

1098
01:00:57,541 --> 01:00:59,500
Hey! Hey! Hey! Get lost, you scaredy-cat!

1099
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,833
Can't you admit that you're afraid? - Hop on if you want to!

1100
01:01:02,333 --> 01:01:05,041
You'll run even if it's written 'fight' somewhere.

1101
01:01:05,541 --> 01:01:08,708
Pick it up, you rascal. - Dude, enough.

1102
01:01:09,208 --> 01:01:09,791
Wait there, man!

1103
01:01:10,291 --> 01:01:12,166
Dude, enough. If these house owners see us, we'll be in trouble.

1104
01:01:12,666 --> 01:01:13,625
Is this why you came this way urgently?

1105
01:01:14,125 --> 01:01:19,958
When I see these plum fruits falling to the floor, I feel shattered.

1106
01:01:20,458 --> 01:01:22,166
It's a stained. I can't even wash it off.

1107
01:01:22,666 --> 01:01:25,916
Wherever he sees plum fruit trees, he'll climb on it, to drive me crazy.

1108
01:01:26,416 --> 01:01:27,875
Come, Lallu. Let's go.

1109
01:01:28,375 --> 01:01:29,875
There's some lying on top of that car.

1110
01:01:30,375 --> 01:01:31,208
Let me take that as well.

1111
01:01:31,708 --> 01:01:35,208
Dude, Lallu... Dude, come back here.

1112
01:01:39,083 --> 01:01:42,583
Yes, Panjikkutta.

1113
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:01,291
Panjikkutta...

1114
01:02:01,791 --> 01:02:03,125
The doors are all locked.

1115
01:02:03,625 --> 01:02:06,125
I think he's planning to make us eat till we die.

1116
01:02:06,625 --> 01:02:08,208
The beef is superb!

1117
01:02:08,708 --> 01:02:13,208
Every piece of beef you take, is as valuable as our lives, you @%@%...

1118
01:02:13,708 --> 01:02:15,083
Eat it.

1119
01:02:15,583 --> 01:02:16,458
The pearl spot fish is superb!

1120
01:02:16,958 --> 01:02:19,000
Sir, don't mind me asking.

1121
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:22,083
Why did you want to meet us urgently?

1122
01:02:22,583 --> 01:02:23,708
The first thing I asked in life to Lallu,

1123
01:02:24,208 --> 01:02:26,208
was not to become friends with the shady boys here.

1124
01:02:26,708 --> 01:02:29,875
Correct. - Yet, he became friends with you.

1125
01:02:30,375 --> 01:02:33,625
From then on, he has never obeyed anything I've told him, till date.

1126
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:36,291
Thus?

1127
01:02:36,791 --> 01:02:38,458
If you tell him, he will obey.

1128
01:02:38,958 --> 01:02:40,625
Only if you tell him, he will obey. - That's all?

1129
01:02:41,125 --> 01:02:41,666
We'll do that!

1130
01:02:42,166 --> 01:02:45,625
I got tensed in vain. Shall I fix a small one?

1131
01:02:46,125 --> 01:02:48,416
Well, you didn't tell us what we should tell him, sir.

1132
01:02:48,916 --> 01:02:50,833
Lallu's wedding has to happen, at the earliest.

1133
01:02:51,333 --> 01:02:54,958
He has been delaying it for so long, citing some lame excuses.

1134
01:02:55,458 --> 01:02:57,625
You should a girl he likes.

1135
01:02:58,125 --> 01:02:59,125
Whoever it is...

1136
01:02:59,625 --> 01:03:01,458
Just tell her that he's Kombanayil John's son.

1137
01:03:01,958 --> 01:03:06,833
What do we tell her if she asks who Kombanayil John is?

1138
01:03:07,333 --> 01:03:08,250
Panji... - Yes.

1139
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:09,291
What is it, Komban sir?

1140
01:03:09,791 --> 01:03:11,458
Komban sravu? (Shark)

1141
01:03:11,958 --> 01:03:15,458
Now it's your duty to get Lallu married.

1142
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:19,666
We didn't have a goal in life so far. Now, our lives have a meaning.

1143
01:03:20,166 --> 01:03:21,500
Don't worry at all, sir.

1144
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,875
Lallu's wedding is our responsibility now.

1145
01:03:25,375 --> 01:03:27,541
We take up this repsosnibility! - Responsibility!

1146
01:03:28,041 --> 01:03:29,958
Yes. That only.

1147
01:03:30,458 --> 01:03:32,666
Sir, can you get me that chicken piece?

1148
01:03:33,166 --> 01:03:34,416
I can't reach there.

1149
01:03:34,916 --> 01:03:38,416
The chicken is superb.

1150
01:03:40,083 --> 01:03:43,583
Eat that gun also.

1151
01:03:47,208 --> 01:03:48,833
Dude, come. Come and get intoxicated.

1152
01:03:49,333 --> 01:03:50,541
Yes.

1153
01:03:51,041 --> 01:03:53,250
Look at him sniffing and finding the way now.

1154
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:55,708
Now he doesn't need a stick no one has to hold his hand too.

1155
01:03:56,208 --> 01:03:59,291
Cheers!

1156
01:03:59,791 --> 01:04:01,833
What is this, Panjikkutta? As if you're drinking for the first time.

1157
01:04:02,333 --> 01:04:04,500
Here you go. Munchies.

1158
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,333
I've brought my own munchies.

1159
01:04:07,833 --> 01:04:09,916
Even if there's high class scotch to drink,

1160
01:04:10,416 --> 01:04:13,291
if some local rum doesn't go in as munchies,

1161
01:04:13,791 --> 01:04:16,666
I'll feel pukish.

1162
01:04:17,166 --> 01:04:19,541
Don't while away your life having munchies, and have a drink!

1163
01:04:20,041 --> 01:04:21,166
It's superb, dude. Try it.

1164
01:04:21,666 --> 01:04:24,000
You have it.

1165
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:25,625
Chetta!

1166
01:04:26,125 --> 01:04:27,208
Any hope? - No way!

1167
01:04:27,708 --> 01:04:28,750
Didn't get even a small fish.

1168
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:30,000
Is that Amoeba?

1169
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:31,750
Yes. - No wonder!

1170
01:04:32,250 --> 01:04:35,291
If you make that bad omen sit in front, how will the fish come?

1171
01:04:35,791 --> 01:04:39,291
Get out of my boat. - Oh no!

1172
01:04:42,250 --> 01:04:44,500
It won't happen!

1173
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,291
I'm telling you. It will happen.

1174
01:04:46,791 --> 01:04:49,041
I'm telling you. It won't happen. Want to bet?

1175
01:04:49,541 --> 01:04:50,541
It will definitely happen.

1176
01:04:51,041 --> 01:04:52,250
What is it? The scene turned serious?

1177
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:53,833
This man is saying that Lallu won't get married

1178
01:04:54,333 --> 01:04:56,125
even when he gets old tooth grows out of his nose.

1179
01:04:56,625 --> 01:04:59,750
I told him that Lallu will get married within the next 3 months. - Get lost.

1180
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:02,583
Him getting married? That's not going to happen.

1181
01:05:03,083 --> 01:05:05,291
Yeah right!

1182
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:08,833
Even if he agrees, I won't let the wedding happen.

1183
01:05:09,333 --> 01:05:11,041
Why? - Hey! Panji rascal!

1184
01:05:11,541 --> 01:05:12,250
Speaking nonsense?

1185
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:15,208
After getting booze from his dad, promising that you'll get him married,

1186
01:05:15,708 --> 01:05:16,958
now you're going back on your word, you rascal?

1187
01:05:17,458 --> 01:05:18,000
I'd have lost my wig now.

1188
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:19,166
Moving away? - Dude!

1189
01:05:19,666 --> 01:05:20,750
Don't go there. Water!

1190
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:22,125
You'll ruin all this.

1191
01:05:22,625 --> 01:05:24,041
Dude, this was all a drama.

1192
01:05:24,541 --> 01:05:25,250
Oh!

1193
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:26,833
So that's how the screenplay rolls?

1194
01:05:27,333 --> 01:05:28,583
We're not joking, dude.

1195
01:05:29,083 --> 01:05:31,250
If Kombanayil John sir has to call us and tell this,

1196
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:33,208
how sad would he be?

1197
01:05:33,708 --> 01:05:34,875
Just think about it.

1198
01:05:35,375 --> 01:05:36,458
What he said is correct, right?

1199
01:05:36,958 --> 01:05:39,083
Why can't you get married? Aren't you a hooman being?

1200
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:40,458
Hooman being!

1201
01:05:40,958 --> 01:05:45,041
So you thought all this was a joke?

1202
01:05:45,541 --> 01:05:46,958
What I said is true.

1203
01:05:47,458 --> 01:05:49,458
I've seen so many girls in my life.

1204
01:05:49,958 --> 01:05:52,916
I haven't felt a spark in anyone I have seen so far.

1205
01:05:53,416 --> 01:05:54,833
Let such a girl come.

1206
01:05:55,333 --> 01:05:59,208
Before that, why should I marry some random girl?

1207
01:05:59,708 --> 01:06:02,166
It's like electricity during rainy season.

1208
01:06:02,666 --> 01:06:03,250
Let it come when it has to.

1209
01:06:03,750 --> 01:06:05,750
Well, how do you know if that girl has a spark?

1210
01:06:06,250 --> 01:06:07,833
Dude...

1211
01:06:08,333 --> 01:06:09,041
When she comes,

1212
01:06:09,541 --> 01:06:13,333
it will be like the entry of some Tamil cinema heroines.

1213
01:06:13,833 --> 01:06:17,750
Ilaiyaraaja and AR Rahman will score music for her together.

1214
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:21,041
Vayalar and Sreekumaran Thampi will write lyrics for her together.

1215
01:06:21,541 --> 01:06:24,333
Shreya Ghoshal and I would sing that song together.

1216
01:06:24,833 --> 01:06:27,625
But will Shreya Ghoshal agree to sing at the bus stand, drumming on the stomach?

1217
01:06:28,125 --> 01:06:30,250
Get lost! Don't disturb when we're talking about the spark.

1218
01:06:30,750 --> 01:06:32,416
Dude, we can't go searching for it.

1219
01:06:32,916 --> 01:06:36,208
It will just happen on its own. - Like an electric shock, right?

1220
01:06:36,708 --> 01:06:37,833
Something is ringing. Oh! The phone?

1221
01:06:38,333 --> 01:06:39,500
Yes, Pappi. Tell me. - Shall we continue drinking?

1222
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:40,500
Where are you now, Lallu?

1223
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,708
Dude, I...

1224
01:06:43,208 --> 01:06:43,583
I'm on the Jankar.

1225
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:45,458
Your friends would be with you, right? - Yes.

1226
01:06:45,958 --> 01:06:47,666
Enjoying life, right?

1227
01:06:48,166 --> 01:06:49,250
You live however you want to.

1228
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:51,708
But why are you troubling others for that?

1229
01:06:52,208 --> 01:06:54,541
You know for how many years Tanya I have been in a relationship?

1230
01:06:55,041 --> 01:06:57,875
Do you know how much she struggled to send her daddy to our house to talk?

1231
01:06:58,375 --> 01:06:59,541
And what happened then?

1232
01:07:00,041 --> 01:07:01,333
I never expected any of this.

1233
01:07:01,833 --> 01:07:04,000
Which princess are you waiting for?

1234
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:06,791
There would be girls who flunked in 10th grade in our village, right?

1235
01:07:07,291 --> 01:07:08,541
Why don't you marry one of them?

1236
01:07:09,041 --> 01:07:09,875
It's not that.

1237
01:07:10,375 --> 01:07:12,166
You just want to ruin my wedding somehow.

1238
01:07:12,666 --> 01:07:16,166
That's all. Bullshit.

1239
01:07:18,166 --> 01:07:19,333
What is it?

1240
01:07:19,833 --> 01:07:21,375
I think that girl cursed Pappi a lot.

1241
01:07:21,875 --> 01:07:23,458
That's what we were saying.

1242
01:07:23,958 --> 01:07:26,625
We will find this girl with a spark for you.

1243
01:07:27,125 --> 01:07:29,250
'Knock and it will open, Poke and you will be caught', right?

1244
01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:30,666
We will find her.

1245
01:07:31,166 --> 01:07:32,166
Son, Faizy...

1246
01:07:32,666 --> 01:07:33,750
There's something called Kismat (destiny).

1247
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:36,000
Your angel will come looking for you.

1248
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:38,041
Maybe tomorrow itself.

1249
01:07:38,541 --> 01:07:40,125
Do you know where our job is tomorrow?

1250
01:07:40,625 --> 01:07:42,916
Where? - A place where only beautiful girls study.

1251
01:07:43,416 --> 01:07:47,041
Ernakulam St. Teresa's College.

1252
01:07:47,541 --> 01:07:48,541
So Omana Kutti.

1253
01:07:49,041 --> 01:07:52,541
Omana Kutti. - Omana Kutti.

1254
01:08:11,333 --> 01:08:12,416
Brake. - Here.

1255
01:08:12,916 --> 01:08:15,041
Keep it on your eyes itself. Don't put it on your head.

1256
01:08:15,541 --> 01:08:17,041
The legs will expand.

1257
01:08:17,541 --> 01:08:20,875
Okay. I'll give it back at night.

1258
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:22,541
Thechikottu Ramachandran (elephant) would feel jealous of this.

1259
01:08:23,041 --> 01:08:24,416
Or, there's a 'Duke', as well. Want it?

1260
01:08:24,916 --> 01:08:27,083
Oh no! I'm not going directly to heaven. I'm going to the college.

1261
01:08:27,583 --> 01:08:31,083
Get me the key.

1262
01:08:48,125 --> 01:08:49,875
Everyone came on Bullets?

1263
01:08:50,375 --> 01:08:54,166
I should have taken the Duke.

1264
01:08:54,666 --> 01:08:57,208
'I don't have the colour of a pineapple'

1265
01:08:57,708 --> 01:09:00,208
Hello, dear. - Get lost.

1266
01:09:00,708 --> 01:09:02,250
Hi.

1267
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:04,708
Kisses to you, darling. - If you agree...

1268
01:09:05,208 --> 01:09:06,416
What's your star sign? - Libra.

1269
01:09:06,916 --> 01:09:07,750
What shady look is this?

1270
01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:12,000
Look at you then!

1271
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:16,333
What is this? A uniform?

1272
01:09:16,833 --> 01:09:18,708
Did you buy it from Ramesh's shop? - Yes.

1273
01:09:19,208 --> 01:09:20,458
That rascal didn't tell me.

1274
01:09:20,958 --> 01:09:22,625
Even to us.

1275
01:09:23,125 --> 01:09:24,833
By the time you bought all this, couldn't you buy an underwear too?

1276
01:09:25,333 --> 01:09:26,083
Who's going to see all that?

1277
01:09:26,583 --> 01:09:27,750
I saw it now, right? - Hey!

1278
01:09:28,250 --> 01:09:31,750
You saw only that much, right? Look over there.

1279
01:09:35,583 --> 01:09:36,916
Okay. - Kattappa!

1280
01:09:37,416 --> 01:09:38,958
You also stabbed me from behind, huh?

1281
01:09:39,458 --> 01:09:41,125
You're as old as my dad!

1282
01:09:41,625 --> 01:09:43,416
Hello! - Panjikkutta, this is Kannappi.

1283
01:09:43,916 --> 01:09:44,875
Understood. What is it?

1284
01:09:45,375 --> 01:09:45,958
Is there work today?

1285
01:09:46,458 --> 01:09:47,000
What?

1286
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:48,166
I am free today.

1287
01:09:48,666 --> 01:09:52,541
You're the 11th scoundrel calling me knowing that the work is at St.Teresa's.

1288
01:09:53,041 --> 01:09:53,625
Hang up and get lost!

1289
01:09:54,125 --> 01:09:57,041
Parippuvada-face!

1290
01:09:57,541 --> 01:10:01,041
Where did Lallu go?

1291
01:10:02,458 --> 01:10:03,208
Ma'am...

1292
01:10:03,708 --> 01:10:04,875
There is someone in the bathroom.

1293
01:10:05,375 --> 01:10:05,916
Someone is over there.

1294
01:10:06,416 --> 01:10:07,708
Panjikkuttan!

1295
01:10:08,208 --> 01:10:09,833
Mr. Panji, what nonsense!

1296
01:10:10,333 --> 01:10:14,916
Who sent him to paint the bathroom, when the girls have to use it?

1297
01:10:15,416 --> 01:10:18,916
Which scoundrel is that?

1298
01:10:20,458 --> 01:10:21,833
How did he reach here? - See!

1299
01:10:22,333 --> 01:10:23,125
Look at him smiling.

1300
01:10:23,625 --> 01:10:24,416
I will call the police. - Oh no!

1301
01:10:24,916 --> 01:10:26,208
I objection, Your Honour. Madam,

1302
01:10:26,708 --> 01:10:29,625
don't pour fruit Lassi over my sincerity.

1303
01:10:30,125 --> 01:10:32,333
It's a bathroom used my so many girls.

1304
01:10:32,833 --> 01:10:36,166
Prioritizing their security, as per my special interest,

1305
01:10:36,666 --> 01:10:40,208
I had appointed him specially.

1306
01:10:40,708 --> 01:10:41,541
Do you know, Madam?

1307
01:10:42,041 --> 01:10:43,791
He is an Ananthan by birth.

1308
01:10:44,291 --> 01:10:45,041
Ananthan? - Yes.

1309
01:10:45,541 --> 01:10:48,833
He is really blind. He can't see.

1310
01:10:49,333 --> 01:10:49,916
Look!

1311
01:10:50,416 --> 01:10:51,666
Still photography! Look!

1312
01:10:52,166 --> 01:10:54,708
Oh no! Sorry, Mr. Panji. Really sorry. - Take it easy. It's okay.

1313
01:10:55,208 --> 01:10:55,750
Son, sorry.

1314
01:10:56,250 --> 01:10:57,000
It's okay, Madam.

1315
01:10:57,500 --> 01:11:00,291
It is said that 'There's no one who hasn't committed a mistake, Gopu'.

1316
01:11:00,791 --> 01:11:02,750
Sorry! - Okay. Go to your classes.

1317
01:11:03,250 --> 01:11:05,125
All of you go to the other toilet. Go!

1318
01:11:05,625 --> 01:11:08,375
You came sniffing all the way here? You rascal!

1319
01:11:08,875 --> 01:11:09,875
And you're quoting dialogues from a soft porn film?

1320
01:11:10,375 --> 01:11:11,541
Who invited you here?

1321
01:11:12,041 --> 01:11:14,666
As a company for Lallu.. - Then where is Lallu?

1322
01:11:15,166 --> 01:11:16,041
There. - Where?

1323
01:11:16,541 --> 01:11:20,041
Oh God!

1324
01:11:55,833 --> 01:11:57,708
Hey!

1325
01:11:58,208 --> 01:11:59,541
Have you come here to work?

1326
01:12:00,041 --> 01:12:01,875
I brought you here to check for the spark!

1327
01:12:02,375 --> 01:12:04,291
The rat has to go in search of rice, the cow has to go in search of grass,

1328
01:12:04,791 --> 01:12:06,416
and the dog has to go in search of bones!

1329
01:12:06,916 --> 01:12:08,375
Then why should Lallu alone wait here?

1330
01:12:08,875 --> 01:12:10,666
I'm shy to look for all that, Panjikkutta.

1331
01:12:11,166 --> 01:12:12,083
Come on. - It won't be right.

1332
01:12:12,583 --> 01:12:13,625
Come. - Let me keep this here.

1333
01:12:14,125 --> 01:12:15,083
Let me keep it, Panjikkutta.

1334
01:12:15,583 --> 01:12:18,208
Come. - The paint can!

1335
01:12:18,708 --> 01:12:22,375
This is a place where all the beauties float around like coconuts in a river.

1336
01:12:22,875 --> 01:12:27,791
Check for one with a spark and select her.

1337
01:12:28,291 --> 01:12:29,291
You're scrubbing again?

1338
01:12:29,791 --> 01:12:33,666
Oh God! Don't give such a sincere worker to any mason in the world!

1339
01:12:34,166 --> 01:12:37,666
Check for the spark! - I will.

1340
01:12:59,291 --> 01:13:02,791
No spark!

1341
01:13:24,750 --> 01:13:25,666
That one had a spark for sure.

1342
01:13:26,166 --> 01:13:27,083
I don't feel the spark alone.

1343
01:13:27,583 --> 01:13:29,291
Sheesh!

1344
01:13:29,791 --> 01:13:33,291
Look! Such a traditional spark.

1345
01:13:38,958 --> 01:13:41,375
You would have liked her, right?

1346
01:13:41,875 --> 01:13:42,541
But...

1347
01:13:43,041 --> 01:13:46,458
no spark. - Oh my God!

1348
01:13:46,958 --> 01:13:50,458
[Singing a popular Malayalam song]

1349
01:13:59,458 --> 01:14:00,916
Come on, clap!

1350
01:14:01,416 --> 01:14:02,791
Thank you. Thank you.

1351
01:14:03,291 --> 01:14:04,208
Chinju...

1352
01:14:04,708 --> 01:14:07,083
Shall Tennyettan recite a poem now?

1353
01:14:07,583 --> 01:14:09,375
No! No! - That won't be necessary, Chetta.

1354
01:14:09,875 --> 01:14:10,958
No. I'll recite the poem as well.

1355
01:14:11,458 --> 01:14:14,875
'I have a grandma'

1356
01:14:15,375 --> 01:14:18,250
'A grandma who narrates stories'

1357
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:22,000
'A grandma who puts me to sleep'

1358
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:26,541
'But now, that grandma is an old age home' - Hey!

1359
01:14:27,041 --> 01:14:28,333
Go! All of you go to your classes.

1360
01:14:28,833 --> 01:14:30,041
Don't get spoilt. Go! Go!

1361
01:14:30,541 --> 01:14:33,208
You rascal! Reciting a poem after sending your grandma to an old age home?

1362
01:14:33,708 --> 01:14:35,083
You idiot! What have you done?

1363
01:14:35,583 --> 01:14:36,375
Shouldn't we look for the spark?

1364
01:14:36,875 --> 01:14:38,333
Why should you look for the spark? Lallu is doing it, right?

1365
01:14:38,833 --> 01:14:40,958
He is standing here. I gathered a crowd for him to look.

1366
01:14:41,458 --> 01:14:42,750
Where is he? - There.

1367
01:14:43,250 --> 01:14:44,125
Where?

1368
01:14:44,625 --> 01:14:46,041
He is over there.

1369
01:14:46,541 --> 01:14:48,416
There.

1370
01:14:48,916 --> 01:14:50,041
This is the teachers' staff room.

1371
01:14:50,541 --> 01:14:51,375
Oh! That's true.

1372
01:14:51,875 --> 01:14:52,500
But go anyway.

1373
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,875
What if you find some 'Malar' from there?

1374
01:14:56,375 --> 01:14:58,666
No, Panjikkutta. It won't be right. - Go, man!

1375
01:14:59,166 --> 01:15:02,833
Go!

1376
01:15:03,333 --> 01:15:06,833
What?

1377
01:15:18,083 --> 01:15:20,041
Did any of them have a spark?

1378
01:15:20,541 --> 01:15:21,708
Everything except a spark is there.

1379
01:15:22,208 --> 01:15:22,750
Not even one?

1380
01:15:23,250 --> 01:15:24,833
Couldn't find even one. - It's okay. We'll look elsewhere.

1381
01:15:25,333 --> 01:15:27,583
'Seek and you will find', says the Bible, right?

1382
01:15:28,083 --> 01:15:29,000
We should keep seeking.

1383
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:31,083
We should constantly keep seeking.

1384
01:15:31,583 --> 01:15:35,625
We will find it. Sure.

1385
01:15:36,125 --> 01:15:39,625
See. Even the priest has started saying so.

1386
01:15:59,791 --> 01:16:04,416
Our Kadamakudy village Panchayat is moving towards a great danger.

1387
01:16:04,916 --> 01:16:08,708
I am someone who has led protests against alcohol and alcoholics.

1388
01:16:09,208 --> 01:16:10,916
And in my parish,

1389
01:16:11,416 --> 01:16:14,333
due to the interference of some rich folks,

1390
01:16:14,833 --> 01:16:17,750
a new beverage (liquor) outlet is about to start functioning.

1391
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:21,958
Yaay!

1392
01:16:22,458 --> 01:16:26,125
That's awesome.

1393
01:16:26,625 --> 01:16:29,458
Well, we clapped for the protest you led against alcohol.

1394
01:16:29,958 --> 01:16:31,083
No! No! - Clap, man!

1395
01:16:31,583 --> 01:16:34,458
Come on, clap!

1396
01:16:34,958 --> 01:16:35,833
- Losers! - Ask where the outlet is.

1397
01:16:36,333 --> 01:16:37,791
What? - Ask where the outlet is coming.

1398
01:16:38,291 --> 01:16:40,208
Get lost. - Hey!

1399
01:16:40,708 --> 01:16:43,208
Lallu and his warriors should leave only after confessing.

1400
01:16:43,708 --> 01:16:45,333
Yes. - No way!

1401
01:16:45,833 --> 01:16:49,333
I won't do it.

1402
01:16:50,833 --> 01:16:52,791
I also sweated like this during that, Father.

1403
01:16:53,291 --> 01:16:55,416
Then we came down...

1404
01:16:55,916 --> 01:16:57,958
Did you understand?

1405
01:16:58,458 --> 01:16:59,791
Shall I say some more? Please, Father.

1406
01:17:00,291 --> 01:17:01,416
It will be great to hear.

1407
01:17:01,916 --> 01:17:03,750
Oh my Jesus!

1408
01:17:04,250 --> 01:17:05,791
Father!

1409
01:17:06,291 --> 01:17:10,791
Father, don't go. There's more. - This is more than enough.

1410
01:17:11,291 --> 01:17:13,208
Father, I need to make a confession. - Huh?

1411
01:17:13,708 --> 01:17:14,625
You took so long, man!

1412
01:17:15,125 --> 01:17:16,666
When I was saying it, I lost the flow of my sins.

1413
01:17:17,166 --> 01:17:18,666
It's all right. I'll give it in a pen drive the next time I come.

1414
01:17:19,166 --> 01:17:21,166
Come. I'm really hungry.

1415
01:17:21,666 --> 01:17:23,041
You're such an idiot, Lallu!

1416
01:17:23,541 --> 01:17:25,916
We know who the idiot is. - That's it.

1417
01:17:26,416 --> 01:17:27,458
That's it. - How did they understand that?

1418
01:17:27,958 --> 01:17:29,708
Why do you ask for it, man?

1419
01:17:30,208 --> 01:17:31,500
Come. Let's go.

1420
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:32,916
Is your confession over?

1421
01:17:33,416 --> 01:17:34,625
Mine is done. - Come. I'm starving.

1422
01:17:35,125 --> 01:17:36,791
No! I need to confess today. There's a lot.

1423
01:17:37,291 --> 01:17:38,041
To confess? - Yes.

1424
01:17:38,541 --> 01:17:39,791
You can do that later. Come! I'm hungry.

1425
01:17:40,291 --> 01:17:42,000
I want to confess today itself. I've practiced for it.

1426
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:43,583
Do it next week, man.

1427
01:17:44,083 --> 01:17:45,041
No! I want to confess today itself.

1428
01:17:45,541 --> 01:17:49,041
I want to confess. That's it.

1429
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:54,333
Father, you came early?

1430
01:17:54,833 --> 01:17:55,416
Sit.

1431
01:17:55,916 --> 01:17:56,958
Praise be to the Lord, Father.

1432
01:17:57,458 --> 01:17:58,875
Now and forever.

1433
01:17:59,375 --> 01:18:02,250
Father, it's been 2-3 years since I confessed. - It's okay.

1434
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:03,375
Come on, begin. - You get going.

1435
01:18:03,875 --> 01:18:06,458
The confession should be a secret. - Okay.

1436
01:18:06,958 --> 01:18:07,583
Well...

1437
01:18:08,083 --> 01:18:11,583
Father, yesterday night, I...

1438
01:18:16,625 --> 01:18:20,125
Then, last week, I...

1439
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:29,458
And then, last month, I....

1440
01:18:29,958 --> 01:18:33,458
So within these two years, I....

1441
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:40,125
Shucks! How will I look at the villagers' faces now?

1442
01:18:40,625 --> 01:18:42,333
But you don't look at their faces, right?

1443
01:18:42,833 --> 01:18:44,875
How are the villagers going to look at your face now?

1444
01:18:45,375 --> 01:18:46,416
Let it go, dear Tenny.

1445
01:18:46,916 --> 01:18:50,166
Let it go. - But announcing it on the mic, was a bit too much.

1446
01:18:50,666 --> 01:18:54,458
For some heroism, I made up a couple of stories as well.

1447
01:18:54,958 --> 01:18:58,458
Chetta, some gravy for me.

1448
01:18:58,958 --> 01:19:01,208
Everyone wants only the gravy. No one buys the curry.

1449
01:19:01,708 --> 01:19:05,458
I have to eat all the meat myself.

1450
01:19:05,958 --> 01:19:06,625
Chetta...

1451
01:19:07,125 --> 01:19:08,250
I asked only for gravy.

1452
01:19:08,750 --> 01:19:09,583
There's a piece in this.

1453
01:19:10,083 --> 01:19:13,583
Take it back.

1454
01:19:14,958 --> 01:19:18,041
It's the first time someone is returning a piece after getting gravy.

1455
01:19:18,541 --> 01:19:19,833
Eat it, son.

1456
01:19:20,333 --> 01:19:23,833
How much, Chetta?

1457
01:19:27,083 --> 01:19:30,583
Wow! Calculator?

1458
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:33,791
What all did you have?

1459
01:19:34,291 --> 01:19:34,958
Two pieces of Puttu.

1460
01:19:35,458 --> 01:19:36,583
Fourteen.

1461
01:19:37,083 --> 01:19:37,583
Two Papads.

1462
01:19:38,083 --> 01:19:39,500
Two Papads would be Six. - Two bananas.

1463
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,541
Six. - One tea.

1464
01:19:42,041 --> 01:19:42,708
Tea would be Eight.

1465
01:19:43,208 --> 01:19:45,208
What's the total?

1466
01:19:45,708 --> 01:19:50,791
14,668 Rupees? - Yes.

1467
01:19:51,291 --> 01:19:52,500
Get lost, man!

1468
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:53,708
Pay for what you ate, man!

1469
01:19:54,208 --> 01:19:56,041
Panjikkutta, what plans for the day?

1470
01:19:56,541 --> 01:19:57,916
Did you forget?

1471
01:19:58,416 --> 01:20:01,375
Chennur 'Kettukalakkal' (harvest) festival. We should definitely go there today.

1472
01:20:01,875 --> 01:20:03,791
That's my only remaining hope.

1473
01:20:04,291 --> 01:20:06,750
You just have to find a girl with a spark at least from there.

1474
01:20:07,250 --> 01:20:09,708
Where are you going? - Your mother's... - Panjikkutta!

1475
01:20:10,208 --> 01:20:11,250
For Chennur Kettukalakku. Coming?

1476
01:20:11,750 --> 01:20:12,250
No way!

1477
01:20:12,750 --> 01:20:15,000
It will be all crowded there, with lots of noise and marsh and what not.

1478
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:16,833
We can't sit peacefully like this.

1479
01:20:17,333 --> 01:20:20,500
Are you crazy to talk to these losers?

1480
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,791
You haven't truly recognized them? - No.

1481
01:20:23,291 --> 01:20:25,166
Dude, in the ads of Lifebuoy soap,

1482
01:20:25,666 --> 01:20:27,041
once the soap is applied and rinsed off,

1483
01:20:27,541 --> 01:20:29,250
all the germs would die,

1484
01:20:29,750 --> 01:20:31,166
except for 2 germs alone, right?

1485
01:20:31,666 --> 01:20:33,416
These two are those two germs!

1486
01:20:33,916 --> 01:20:35,125
Dinku Minku.

1487
01:20:35,625 --> 01:20:36,750
Correct!

1488
01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:40,750
Chennur Kettukalakku Festival, 2019.

1489
01:20:46,583 --> 01:20:47,583
There's a special announcement.

1490
01:20:48,083 --> 01:20:50,375
Those who have caught fish already, should make way...

1491
01:20:50,875 --> 01:20:54,833
to give an opportunity for people who are yet to catch fish.

1492
01:20:55,333 --> 01:20:57,833
Look, man! So much fish!

1493
01:20:58,333 --> 01:21:00,291
People are grabbing loads of fish with their hands.

1494
01:21:00,791 --> 01:21:02,958
And this guy is sitting with a bait. He's such a failure, man!

1495
01:21:03,458 --> 01:21:06,416
Let's go. You know why? Awesome girls have come from both shores.

1496
01:21:06,916 --> 01:21:09,125
How did you see that? - I got the smell of their perfumes.

1497
01:21:09,625 --> 01:21:12,041
Live fish curry and tapioca, prepared by our sisters from Kudumbasree,

1498
01:21:12,541 --> 01:21:13,666
are available at the stall. All should try it.

1499
01:21:14,166 --> 01:21:15,458
Hey wreck! Eat it and go, man!

1500
01:21:15,958 --> 01:21:19,458
Get lost, man!

1501
01:21:23,916 --> 01:21:27,416
Buying a new dress didn't go in vain.

1502
01:21:30,333 --> 01:21:33,625
Look! Our guy is here.

1503
01:21:34,125 --> 01:21:35,750
Not ours.

1504
01:21:36,250 --> 01:21:36,750
Mine.

1505
01:21:37,250 --> 01:21:38,958
Hey! Just hold him. I'll be right back.

1506
01:21:39,458 --> 01:21:40,333
Where is he going? - I'll be right back.

1507
01:21:40,833 --> 01:21:41,916
I think he got a spark.

1508
01:21:42,416 --> 01:21:43,541
Just a minute. - There?

1509
01:21:44,041 --> 01:21:46,708
The Kettukalakkal festival begins now.

1510
01:21:47,208 --> 01:21:50,875
'I don't know your name'

1511
01:21:51,375 --> 01:21:55,750
'I don't know where you're from'

1512
01:21:56,250 --> 01:22:01,666
'But I know one thing for sure'

1513
01:22:02,166 --> 01:22:07,750
'One day, you will definitely come to me'

1514
01:22:08,250 --> 01:22:11,125
Now Bengalis are singing even for the Kettukalakku festival in our village.

1515
01:22:11,625 --> 01:22:14,041
Isn't anyone here to sing in the classical language, Malayalam?

1516
01:22:14,541 --> 01:22:17,583
Panjikkutta, shall I start? - Oh my dear! No!

1517
01:22:18,083 --> 01:22:21,583
Lallu!

1518
01:22:37,041 --> 01:22:39,416
'The girl on the branch of my courtyard'

1519
01:22:39,916 --> 01:22:42,541
'The girl as pretty as a parrot'

1520
01:22:43,041 --> 01:22:45,666
'The girl on the branch of my courtyard The girl as pretty as a parrot'

1521
01:22:46,166 --> 01:22:48,416
'Why does she come and flirt with me often?'

1522
01:22:48,916 --> 01:22:51,708
'If the bride I am looking for appears before me,

1523
01:22:52,208 --> 01:22:54,208
our marriage should happen at that moment'

1524
01:22:54,708 --> 01:23:00,250
'I'm waiting for her since forever, with my eyes set on all the paths'

1525
01:23:00,750 --> 01:23:06,458
'The sun has laid a silver silk, won't she come, wearing a Bindi?'

1526
01:23:06,958 --> 01:23:09,666
'The girl on the branch of my courtyard'

1527
01:23:10,166 --> 01:23:13,666
'The girl as pretty as a parrot'

1528
01:23:43,083 --> 01:23:48,666
'If she's humming a boat-song, she's a girl from Alappuzha'

1529
01:23:49,166 --> 01:23:54,791
'If snow falls while she talks, she's the darling of Munnar'

1530
01:23:55,291 --> 01:24:00,500
'If I can spot the Kalpathi chariot race in her eyes, I know her place is Palakkad'

1531
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:06,291
'If she wears a Hijab and sings a lovely tune, she's a girl from Kallayi'

1532
01:24:06,791 --> 01:24:10,291
'She's a treasure trove of beauty that stuns our eyes'

1533
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:08,208
'If there's the rhythm of Thayambaka drums in her heart, she's a girl from Mattannur'

1534
01:25:08,708 --> 01:25:14,208
'When she is shy, if she drops Sindoor, she is from Thenkasi'

1535
01:25:14,708 --> 01:25:20,083
'Though she looks bold, if she has mercy in her heart, she is from Kochi'

1536
01:25:20,583 --> 01:25:25,916
'If she dances with the rhythm of the Tavil, she is a pretty lass from Thanjavur'

1537
01:25:26,416 --> 01:25:29,000
'When she comes, there is a rain of flowers'

1538
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:32,166
'The girl on the branch of my courtyard The girl as pretty as a parrot'

1539
01:25:32,666 --> 01:25:36,166
'Why does she come and flirt with me often?'

1540
01:25:53,625 --> 01:25:57,125
It's time for Kummankuthu dance!

1541
01:26:10,625 --> 01:26:11,625
Member!

1542
01:26:12,125 --> 01:26:13,250
There's a huge fight happening at the Kettukalakku venue.

1543
01:26:13,750 --> 01:26:17,250
Fight? With whom?

1544
01:29:27,291 --> 01:29:29,083
You little devil. So you were in love with her, huh?

1545
01:29:29,583 --> 01:29:30,083
Get lost.

1546
01:29:30,583 --> 01:29:31,250
She's not my girl.

1547
01:29:31,750 --> 01:29:32,791
I haven't felt a spark in her.

1548
01:29:33,291 --> 01:29:34,541
Then why did you go and fight for her?

1549
01:29:35,041 --> 01:29:38,875
Didn't you say that you would fight only if someone insults your mom?

1550
01:29:39,375 --> 01:29:43,333
There is a mother in every woman.

1551
01:29:43,833 --> 01:29:46,208
Son...

1552
01:29:46,708 --> 01:29:48,041
What is your name?

1553
01:29:48,541 --> 01:29:50,708
Everyone calls me Lallu.

1554
01:29:51,208 --> 01:29:54,708
My actual name is...

1555
01:30:01,875 --> 01:30:04,541
Awesome!

1556
01:30:05,041 --> 01:30:07,041
Don't cut your hair!

1557
01:30:07,541 --> 01:30:08,333
Does she have spark?

1558
01:30:08,833 --> 01:30:09,916
No! I told that seeing her hair.

1559
01:30:10,416 --> 01:30:12,083
Hey! I quit.

1560
01:30:12,583 --> 01:30:13,791
I'm quitting this game.

1561
01:30:14,291 --> 01:30:17,208
It's been a long time searching a girl for him, without doing my job.

1562
01:30:17,708 --> 01:30:20,083
Women's college, Veega Land, Lulu Mall, Novena Church.

1563
01:30:20,583 --> 01:30:22,333
We took to all such places where girls come.

1564
01:30:22,833 --> 01:30:23,791
And he didn't like anyone!

1565
01:30:24,291 --> 01:30:26,250
But we haven't taken him where his girl is.

1566
01:30:26,750 --> 01:30:28,166
That's the problem. - I'm not going with him again.

1567
01:30:28,666 --> 01:30:32,416
I'm leaving. - I'm also leaving. - Wait there.

1568
01:30:32,916 --> 01:30:33,500
What is it?

1569
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:35,791
Drop me home, man. How else will I go home?

1570
01:30:36,291 --> 01:30:38,166
I forgot about this load shedding.

1571
01:30:38,666 --> 01:30:40,041
Put him on. - Raise your leg.

1572
01:30:40,541 --> 01:30:45,416
So from tomorrow, we're not running behind the spark!

1573
01:30:45,916 --> 01:30:49,708
Run!

1574
01:30:50,208 --> 01:30:51,791
Jump!

1575
01:30:52,291 --> 01:30:55,000
Jump!

1576
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:56,125
What was that sound?

1577
01:30:56,625 --> 01:30:57,750
A coconut fell into the water.

1578
01:30:58,250 --> 01:31:01,750
If we took it, I could have given it at home.

1579
01:31:10,333 --> 01:31:10,916
Okay. Brake!

1580
01:31:11,416 --> 01:31:14,916
What is it? - We've reached the spot.

1581
01:31:18,041 --> 01:31:18,958
I saw my girl, buddy.

1582
01:31:19,458 --> 01:31:20,458
When?

1583
01:31:20,958 --> 01:31:22,208
How? - Where?

1584
01:31:22,708 --> 01:31:23,416
Here.

1585
01:31:23,916 --> 01:31:25,333
Here? - Is she here?

1586
01:31:25,833 --> 01:31:29,333
Where over here?

1587
01:31:33,625 --> 01:31:37,416
'Missing'

1588
01:31:37,916 --> 01:31:40,583
Missing?

1589
01:31:41,083 --> 01:31:44,583
A missing girl whose photo is on the newspaper.

1590
01:32:05,916 --> 01:32:08,041
I was always sure that he'll bring up some complicated case like this.

1591
01:32:08,541 --> 01:32:09,750
So many girls came after you, right?

1592
01:32:10,250 --> 01:32:12,250
And what you didn't feel for any of them, you felt for this missing girl?

1593
01:32:12,750 --> 01:32:13,291
This is so funny!

1594
01:32:13,791 --> 01:32:17,000
I doubt that this is his trick to delay his wedding.

1595
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:18,375
Thus?

1596
01:32:18,875 --> 01:32:19,750
Lallu...

1597
01:32:20,250 --> 01:32:24,750
What if this girl went missing because she loves someone and eloped with him?

1598
01:32:25,250 --> 01:32:26,916
Or what if she's already married?

1599
01:32:27,416 --> 01:32:28,166
Leave all that.

1600
01:32:28,666 --> 01:32:30,375
Imagine that you found her.

1601
01:32:30,875 --> 01:32:32,083
What if she doesn't like you?

1602
01:32:32,583 --> 01:32:33,125
No way!

1603
01:32:33,625 --> 01:32:35,041
No chance that she won't like him. - Why?

1604
01:32:35,541 --> 01:32:36,458
This guy doesn't have haters.

1605
01:32:36,958 --> 01:32:37,791
Dude...

1606
01:32:38,291 --> 01:32:38,833
Leave this.

1607
01:32:39,333 --> 01:32:40,208
We'll check for someone else.

1608
01:32:40,708 --> 01:32:42,208
What have you all thought?

1609
01:32:42,708 --> 01:32:44,833
Have I told you about any girl till date?

1610
01:32:45,333 --> 01:32:47,958
Like you, I also don't know why I feel so only towards her!

1611
01:32:48,458 --> 01:32:50,958
I just want to see that girl once.

1612
01:32:51,458 --> 01:32:53,125
Romance... Marriage...

1613
01:32:53,625 --> 01:32:54,875
That's all later, right?

1614
01:32:55,375 --> 01:32:56,791
I just want to see her somehow.

1615
01:32:57,291 --> 01:32:58,083
Can you help me for that?

1616
01:32:58,583 --> 01:33:02,083
Yes.

1617
01:33:03,041 --> 01:33:04,750
Hurry up!

1618
01:33:05,250 --> 01:33:08,750
Yes.

1619
01:33:10,166 --> 01:33:10,958
Oh God!

1620
01:33:11,458 --> 01:33:13,250
Isn't that an ambulance? - Yes.

1621
01:33:13,750 --> 01:33:14,458
What a good omen!

1622
01:33:14,958 --> 01:33:18,750
From the looks of it, all four of us might have the fortune to travel in it.

1623
01:33:19,250 --> 01:33:20,291
Then nothing to worry.

1624
01:33:20,791 --> 01:33:23,083
We'll start our mission to find that girl right away.

1625
01:33:23,583 --> 01:33:25,458
Come on, boys! Come on! - Yes.

1626
01:33:25,958 --> 01:33:27,708
Hey! Wait!

1627
01:33:28,208 --> 01:33:29,000
This...

1628
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:32,625
Between these punch dialogues, there's something that you sirs have forgotten.

1629
01:33:33,125 --> 01:33:34,541
What? - What's that?

1630
01:33:35,041 --> 01:33:36,750
We came here for a painting job.

1631
01:33:37,250 --> 01:33:42,583
You can go on your mission after you finish that!

1632
01:33:43,083 --> 01:33:44,166
I'm not working. - Really?

1633
01:33:44,666 --> 01:33:46,250
Hey!

1634
01:33:46,750 --> 01:33:47,583
He left. - Lallu!

1635
01:33:48,083 --> 01:33:48,958
Panjikkutta...

1636
01:33:49,458 --> 01:33:50,458
Looks like he's quite serious.

1637
01:33:50,958 --> 01:33:54,458
Yes.

1638
01:34:02,958 --> 01:34:06,458
Now I'll have to hear a mouthful from him.

1639
01:34:15,375 --> 01:34:18,875
What is it?

1640
01:34:20,541 --> 01:34:22,125
Pappi...

1641
01:34:22,625 --> 01:34:26,125
What happened?

1642
01:34:29,833 --> 01:34:32,250
When I had a great job and a high salary,

1643
01:34:32,750 --> 01:34:34,791
I thought I had achieved everything in life.

1644
01:34:35,291 --> 01:34:38,416
But, the pressure I had to go through, to maintain all that...

1645
01:34:38,916 --> 01:34:41,041
It was much more than I could tolerate.

1646
01:34:41,541 --> 01:34:42,666
The junk food there...

1647
01:34:43,166 --> 01:34:44,500
Late night work hours without sleep...

1648
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,875
Daily harassment from the boss...

1649
01:34:47,375 --> 01:34:50,791
And Tanya torturing me full time about marriage...

1650
01:34:51,291 --> 01:34:54,791
With all that, I was quite disturbed.

1651
01:35:22,541 --> 01:35:24,375
Dude, what happened?

1652
01:35:24,875 --> 01:35:27,333
Come, let's go and check.

1653
01:35:27,833 --> 01:35:30,458
Pappi, what happened?

1654
01:35:30,958 --> 01:35:31,666
That day...

1655
01:35:32,166 --> 01:35:35,666
if that whistle you gave me wasn't with me, Lallu....

1656
01:35:38,708 --> 01:35:40,166
Didn't I tell you back then itself...

1657
01:35:40,666 --> 01:35:44,166
to come with me for a painting job!

1658
01:35:48,666 --> 01:35:49,416
Hey!

1659
01:35:49,916 --> 01:35:53,000
I feel like crying whenever I see a family scene like this.

1660
01:35:53,500 --> 01:35:54,875
Come. Let's eat something.

1661
01:35:55,375 --> 01:35:57,291
Pappi...

1662
01:35:57,791 --> 01:35:59,250
Shall we go for a ride?

1663
01:35:59,750 --> 01:36:00,291
Let's go.

1664
01:36:00,791 --> 01:36:03,458
Omana Kutti.

1665
01:36:03,958 --> 01:36:05,375
Go.

1666
01:36:05,875 --> 01:36:07,791
This ride is great, Lallu.

1667
01:36:08,291 --> 01:36:09,416
Where are we going actually?

1668
01:36:09,916 --> 01:36:12,083
The meat seller Robin from Koonammavu. It's his wedding tomorrow.

1669
01:36:12,583 --> 01:36:18,416
Whatever celebration it may be, the previous night is the best part.

1670
01:36:18,916 --> 01:36:20,291
You loser!

1671
01:36:20,791 --> 01:36:22,458
Are you cutting the cake like you cut meat?

1672
01:36:22,958 --> 01:36:24,458
I thought that I was in my shop for a moment.

1673
01:36:24,958 --> 01:36:26,416
Hey! Are you getting intoxicated?

1674
01:36:26,916 --> 01:36:27,791
Yes! Yes. - Awesome.

1675
01:36:28,291 --> 01:36:29,916
Want to join? - No way!

1676
01:36:30,416 --> 01:36:30,958
Babuchetta...

1677
01:36:31,458 --> 01:36:33,500
Looks like you're losing? - There was no Jankar then, right?

1678
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,041
During that flood,

1679
01:36:35,541 --> 01:36:38,916
I pushed the boat all alone, and pushed again...

1680
01:36:39,416 --> 01:36:40,583
You'll push it and turn it over, huh?

1681
01:36:41,083 --> 01:36:44,375
What is this, Vareethetta? - Get lost! Made me lose the flow of the story.

1682
01:36:44,875 --> 01:36:47,458
All of you are so colourful! - Hi.

1683
01:36:47,958 --> 01:36:48,833
Yo! - Awesome.

1684
01:36:49,333 --> 01:36:49,916
This is my brother. Pappi.

1685
01:36:50,416 --> 01:36:51,333
So that's you, huh?

1686
01:36:51,833 --> 01:36:53,958
Yes. - Are you the one with a computer job?

1687
01:36:54,458 --> 01:36:55,000
Yes.

1688
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:56,750
This Lambi aunty isn't like what she looks.

1689
01:36:57,250 --> 01:36:59,500
She passed 10th grade at 73 years of age.

1690
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:00,750
Her photo had come on the newspaper too.

1691
01:37:01,250 --> 01:37:02,958
She copied and passed the exam!

1692
01:37:03,458 --> 01:37:04,458
Get lost!

1693
01:37:04,958 --> 01:37:07,958
When your mobile got dirty, you washed it in canal water, right?

1694
01:37:08,458 --> 01:37:10,666
Don't waste time talking, and break her head with a brick!

1695
01:37:11,166 --> 01:37:13,916
One brick here, please.

1696
01:37:14,416 --> 01:37:15,083
Hey Lallu...

1697
01:37:15,583 --> 01:37:16,958
What, man? Where were you?

1698
01:37:17,458 --> 01:37:18,583
Wow! You look awesome.

1699
01:37:19,083 --> 01:37:19,708
Nice? - It's superb.

1700
01:37:20,208 --> 01:37:21,541
It's new. - This is Pappi.

1701
01:37:22,041 --> 01:37:22,708
Are you on leave now? - Yes.

1702
01:37:23,208 --> 01:37:24,458
He's the groom.

1703
01:37:24,958 --> 01:37:27,166
Nice, right? Hello! I'll come now.

1704
01:37:27,666 --> 01:37:28,458
Have food. Go ahead.

1705
01:37:28,958 --> 01:37:29,541
Did dinner start?

1706
01:37:30,041 --> 01:37:32,375
Come, Pappi. - If they serve the curry, we could start eating.

1707
01:37:32,875 --> 01:37:35,000
Intestine curry. Serve it and come behind me.

1708
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:36,041
But I...

1709
01:37:36,541 --> 01:37:37,333
Here. - Serve it.

1710
01:37:37,833 --> 01:37:38,291
Serve it here, son.

1711
01:37:38,791 --> 01:37:41,208
Where's the other guy? - Since it's crab curry at his home, he's lazy to come.

1712
01:37:41,708 --> 01:37:45,041
At my house, it's veg curry. Then why the hell should I stay home?

1713
01:37:45,541 --> 01:37:46,083
Move your hand.

1714
01:37:46,583 --> 01:37:47,208
Did you eat?

1715
01:37:47,708 --> 01:37:49,250
That boy didn't serve enough. - Serve some more.

1716
01:37:49,750 --> 01:37:50,416
You eat that first.

1717
01:37:50,916 --> 01:37:51,458
I'll serve.

1718
01:37:51,958 --> 01:37:54,583
Chetta, do you have cauliflower curry to pour it in its centre?

1719
01:37:55,083 --> 01:37:55,750
It's coming after me.

1720
01:37:56,250 --> 01:37:57,416
Dig a well and keep.

1721
01:37:57,916 --> 01:37:59,458
Okay Chetta.

1722
01:37:59,958 --> 01:38:02,500
This is not an eating competition!

1723
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:04,916
What a fresh joke that no one has ever heard during a wedding!

1724
01:38:05,416 --> 01:38:08,625
Who said that?

1725
01:38:09,125 --> 01:38:11,416
Chetta, some intestine curry, please.

1726
01:38:11,916 --> 01:38:14,625
What's the intestine for? I'll give you my heart!

1727
01:38:15,125 --> 01:38:17,625
If I was Hanuman, I would have torn my chest open.

1728
01:38:18,125 --> 01:38:19,500
Hanuman's figure is all right.

1729
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,708
But, talent....

1730
01:38:23,208 --> 01:38:25,041
Shall I serve some liver curry? - No.

1731
01:38:25,541 --> 01:38:26,958
Here? - Yes. You want it? - Yes.

1732
01:38:27,458 --> 01:38:28,833
What's your name? - Nikhila.

1733
01:38:29,333 --> 01:38:31,291
My dear people, a happy news for you.

1734
01:38:31,791 --> 01:38:33,750

1736

Eat fast. Let's get home before he starts singing!

1737
01:38:42,291 --> 01:38:44,291
My dear people, none of you should leave.

1738

1739

will you set fire and stop it?

Isn't there anyone to sing a Mammootty song?

1758
01:41:23,750 --> 01:41:27,250
[Superhit Mammootty song from 'Pinnilavu']

1759
01:42:11,833 --> 01:42:14,166
I didn't expect a tea shop like this to be open here at this hour.

1760
01:42:14,666 --> 01:42:15,875
This is not an ordinary tea shop.

1761
01:42:16,375 --> 01:42:18,375
It opens only for the boat men who fish during the night.

1762
01:42:18,875 --> 01:42:20,583
It's open till 4 AM.

1763
01:42:21,083 --> 01:42:22,958
To eat Ezhikkara Mohan Chettan's Puttu Dal curry,

1764
01:42:23,458 --> 01:42:25,041
people come rowing boats even from Antarctica.

1765
01:42:25,541 --> 01:42:27,583
Look! Just like them. - Enough, man! Here.

1766
01:42:28,083 --> 01:42:29,166
My younger brother. Pappi.

1767
01:42:29,666 --> 01:42:32,875
Catch it. The Papad will fly away.

1768
01:42:33,375 --> 01:42:35,708
Hey!

1769
01:42:36,208 --> 01:42:40,250
I'm not able to laugh with all my heart like you, Lallu.

1770
01:42:40,750 --> 01:42:42,458
Education is not such a big deal.

1771
01:42:42,958 --> 01:42:43,833
You need education, man.

1772
01:42:44,333 --> 01:42:45,000
It's good.

1773
01:42:45,500 --> 01:42:48,291
Nothing goes wasted, right?

1774
01:42:48,791 --> 01:42:50,625
You used to study really well in school, right?

1775
01:42:51,125 --> 01:42:52,916
And you stopped when there was some issue, right?

1776
01:42:53,416 --> 01:42:56,166
There was a boy who studied better than me in my class.

1777
01:42:56,666 --> 01:42:57,791
Vishal.

1778
01:42:58,291 --> 01:43:02,458
From a very young age, there was a competition in studies between me and him.

1779
01:43:02,958 --> 01:43:03,500
One day,

1780
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:07,333
he was expelled from school, because he didn't pay the fees on time.

1781
01:43:07,833 --> 01:43:11,333
That idiot jumped down from the terrace, because of that.

1782
01:43:14,916 --> 01:43:17,500
A life sacrificed for the sake of money.

1783
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,041
What's the relation between money and education?

1784
01:43:20,541 --> 01:43:22,541
All these schools and hospitals are in Gods' names.

1785
01:43:23,041 --> 01:43:24,291
And they charge exorbitant money too.

1786
01:43:24,791 --> 01:43:26,458
Why does God need our money?

1787
01:43:26,958 --> 01:43:28,625
Is that why you stopped studies?

1788
01:43:29,125 --> 01:43:32,000
I told dad that I won't go back to that school.

1789
01:43:32,500 --> 01:43:34,250
I thought dad would scold me.

1790
01:43:34,750 --> 01:43:35,958
'If you're not interested, you needn't go'

1791
01:43:36,458 --> 01:43:37,791
'Do what you feel is right' That's what dad told me.

1792
01:43:38,291 --> 01:43:39,750
No way! Our dad?

1793
01:43:40,250 --> 01:43:41,625
Then? Do I have another dad?

1794
01:43:42,125 --> 01:43:44,375
Dad has forced me only when it came to your wedding.

1795
01:43:44,875 --> 01:43:45,583
You know that?

1796
01:43:46,083 --> 01:43:47,708
You needn't hurry for that now, Lallu.

1797
01:43:48,208 --> 01:43:51,833
You should find the girl who has a spark, and get married to her.

1798
01:43:52,333 --> 01:43:54,875
Stay happy, Lallu.

1799
01:43:55,375 --> 01:43:57,125
I was happy.

1800
01:43:57,625 --> 01:44:01,125
Until yesterday.

1801
01:44:07,291 --> 01:44:08,333
What is it?

1802
01:44:08,833 --> 01:44:10,458
Nothing.

1803
01:44:10,958 --> 01:44:12,041
Lallu...

1804
01:44:12,541 --> 01:44:14,416
Mulavukadu SI Abhilash Karikken is the brother of Anoop,

1805
01:44:14,916 --> 01:44:16,958
who studied with me in Navodaya.

1806
01:44:17,458 --> 01:44:19,333
He holds me in high regard.

1807
01:44:19,833 --> 01:44:20,708
I'll give him a call.

1808
01:44:21,208 --> 01:44:22,458
Just go and meet him.

1809
01:44:22,958 --> 01:44:27,583
He'll help you in some way or the other.

1810
01:44:28,083 --> 01:44:28,833
Hold it.

1811
01:44:29,333 --> 01:44:31,041
Won't you continue playing?

1812
01:44:31,541 --> 01:44:35,041
I'll be right back.

1813
01:44:36,208 --> 01:44:40,166
Sir. - Let's stand there. It's too noisy here.

1814
01:44:40,666 --> 01:44:41,333
I had called them.

1815
01:44:41,833 --> 01:44:46,208
Normally, there are 3 possibilities if a girl goes missing.

1816
01:44:46,708 --> 01:44:49,375
In most cases, they fall in love and elope with someone.

1817
01:44:49,875 --> 01:44:51,791
Or else, they would fight with their families,

1818
01:44:52,291 --> 01:44:55,083
and stay away to scare them, because they are upset.

1819
01:44:55,583 --> 01:44:57,333
Or else, someone should kidnap them.

1820
01:44:57,833 --> 01:45:00,750
This girl called Diya is a PRO at Aster Med-city.

1821
01:45:01,250 --> 01:45:02,583
And she's not from a rich background either.

1822
01:45:03,083 --> 01:45:06,791
So we needn't consider that possibility. What will they get if they kidnap her?

1823
01:45:07,291 --> 01:45:10,125
The main possibility is that she would have had some affair.

1824
01:45:10,625 --> 01:45:13,250
And she would have eloped. That's what we expect.

1825
01:45:13,750 --> 01:45:16,333
Sir, that's the first thing people say when any girl goes missing.

1826
01:45:16,833 --> 01:45:19,541
Not like that. I'm saying this because there are precise findings.

1827
01:45:20,041 --> 01:45:22,208
There's a Nithya Shenoy who's working with Diya.

1828
01:45:22,708 --> 01:45:23,458
Her hostel room-mate.

1829
01:45:23,958 --> 01:45:26,250
She was the last person to see Diya.

1830
01:45:26,750 --> 01:45:29,708
Diya left from the hostel saying that she's going to the hospital, to Nithya.

1831
01:45:30,208 --> 01:45:33,166
But it's very clear on CCTV visuals...

1832
01:45:33,666 --> 01:45:35,666
... that Diya hasn't gone through the road to the hostel.

1833
01:45:36,166 --> 01:45:38,291
There's an eastern gate behind the hospital.

1834
01:45:38,791 --> 01:45:39,750
She left through that gate.

1835
01:45:40,250 --> 01:45:43,166
That's why we reached such a confirmation.

1836
01:45:43,666 --> 01:45:45,416
Sir, is there any way to get this Nithya's number? - How?

1837
01:45:45,916 --> 01:45:47,208
There are many official complications for that.

1838
01:45:47,708 --> 01:45:48,291
She's her room-mate, right?

1839
01:45:48,791 --> 01:45:50,166
Just to know about Diya.

1840
01:45:50,666 --> 01:45:51,833
Sir, why? Please sir.

1841
01:45:52,333 --> 01:45:53,833
Head over heels, huh?

1842
01:45:54,333 --> 01:45:55,250
Not that. - It's all right.

1843
01:45:55,750 --> 01:45:56,666
Just go to the station. I'll inform them.

1844
01:45:57,166 --> 01:46:00,666
Okay sir. Thank you.

1845
01:46:06,666 --> 01:46:07,458
Hello! - Where are you?

1846
01:46:07,958 --> 01:46:09,208
I'm at the park only.

1847
01:46:09,708 --> 01:46:11,875
What happened? - I got Diya's friend's phone number.

1848
01:46:12,375 --> 01:46:12,916
But she's not picking up.

1849
01:46:13,416 --> 01:46:14,583
I'm going directly to the hospital.

1850
01:46:15,083 --> 01:46:16,333
You go ahead, my dear.

1851
01:46:16,833 --> 01:46:20,208
So, Omana Kutti. - Omana Kutti.

1852
01:46:20,708 --> 01:46:24,208
Oh God!

1853
01:47:02,791 --> 01:47:03,458
Dad!

1854
01:47:03,958 --> 01:47:04,958
Please forgive me, dad.

1855
01:47:05,458 --> 01:47:07,458
I haven't done anything wrong, dad.

1856
01:47:07,958 --> 01:47:09,541
This was the first time I went there.

1857
01:47:10,041 --> 01:47:12,041
I won't meet him ever again, dad.

1858
01:47:12,541 --> 01:47:14,875
I won't do anything that you don't like.

1859
01:47:15,375 --> 01:47:17,958
Dad, please talk to me.

1860
01:47:18,458 --> 01:47:21,958
Scold me, at least.

1861
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,708
Under the shade of every umbrella there,

1862
01:47:33,208 --> 01:47:39,250
there's the scorching heat that the parents suffer to educate their children.

1863
01:47:39,750 --> 01:47:44,000
They have many dreams about you all.

1864
01:47:44,500 --> 01:47:48,916
It would be nice if the children remember that.

1865
01:47:49,416 --> 01:47:52,666
It's all right. Let it go.

1866
01:47:53,166 --> 01:47:54,666
You're not angry at me, right?

1867
01:47:55,166 --> 01:47:56,583
I'm not angry.

1868
01:47:57,083 --> 01:47:57,875
Go and study.

1869
01:47:58,375 --> 01:48:00,208
You need to write clear a lot of supplementary exams, right?

1870
01:48:00,708 --> 01:48:04,041
Go! - Stop it, dad.

1871
01:48:04,541 --> 01:48:08,041
Panjikkutta!

1872
01:48:08,541 --> 01:48:09,333
Panjikkutta! - Move!

1873
01:48:09,833 --> 01:48:10,875
What is it? - Come fast.

1874
01:48:11,375 --> 01:48:13,375
Where are you rushing?

1875
01:48:13,875 --> 01:48:15,000
What's the matter? - Don't know.

1876
01:48:15,500 --> 01:48:16,666
When we saw him running, we also ran for a punch.

1877
01:48:17,166 --> 01:48:18,458
There's some silly matter. Otherwise he won't run like this.

1878
01:48:18,958 --> 01:48:19,916
Shut up, man!

1879
01:48:20,416 --> 01:48:21,375
What's the matter?

1880
01:48:21,875 --> 01:48:22,791
I went to the hospital to see Diya's friend.

1881
01:48:23,291 --> 01:48:24,375
But she wasn't there.

1882
01:48:24,875 --> 01:48:26,083
Shall we go to their hostel? - Move.

1883
01:48:26,583 --> 01:48:26,875
At this time?

1884
01:48:27,375 --> 01:48:30,208
You fool! It's a ladies' hostel. They shut the gates at 6.55 PM sharp.

1885
01:48:30,708 --> 01:48:33,833
Do you know how many times I've waited disappointed in front of its gate?

1886
01:48:34,333 --> 01:48:36,208
Thus? - Look here and talk.

1887
01:48:36,708 --> 01:48:37,250
Thus?

1888
01:48:37,750 --> 01:48:38,958
If the gate is closed, we'll jump over the wall.

1889
01:48:39,458 --> 01:48:40,791
Love doesn't have eyes or noses.

1890
01:48:41,291 --> 01:48:43,583
But the security guard there has arms and legs. Remember that.

1891
01:48:44,083 --> 01:48:46,083
It's not like old times.

1892
01:48:46,583 --> 01:48:47,333
It's a ladies' hostel.

1893
01:48:47,833 --> 01:48:51,500
If someone sees you, you'll get thrashed like crazy, and be humiliated like anything.

1894
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:57,666
I am in love, Chetta. How can I not show courage?

1895
01:48:58,166 --> 01:49:00,875
So, we will break into the hostel today.

1896
01:49:01,375 --> 01:49:02,875
Yes. - No!

1897
01:49:03,375 --> 01:49:05,916
We're not breaking into the hostel today.

1898
01:49:06,416 --> 01:49:07,791
I have a daughter of marriageable age.

1899
01:49:08,291 --> 01:49:11,750
I don't wish to get a policeman's boot's tattoo on my chest.

1900
01:49:12,250 --> 01:49:13,041
So you're not coming?

1901
01:49:13,541 --> 01:49:17,333
Dude, why don't we go tomorrow?

1902
01:49:17,833 --> 01:49:20,375
Vicky, what about you?

1903
01:49:20,875 --> 01:49:23,291
From childhood, you took me along as a warrior.

1904
01:49:23,791 --> 01:49:27,041
I have always been with you, to die or kill at your command.

1905
01:49:27,541 --> 01:49:28,875
I've never even asked the reason.

1906
01:49:29,375 --> 01:49:30,000
But please avoid me from this!

1907
01:49:30,500 --> 01:49:32,166
My arm is still reeling from the last beating I got.

1908
01:49:32,666 --> 01:49:33,875
No! None of you have to come.

1909
01:49:34,375 --> 01:49:35,708
I'll go alone.

1910
01:49:36,208 --> 01:49:37,250
Hey!

1911
01:49:37,750 --> 01:49:38,916
Even if no one else is coming, I'll come with you.

1912
01:49:39,416 --> 01:49:41,291
I will guide you.

1913
01:49:41,791 --> 01:49:42,791
Who will guide him then? - Where are you going?

1914
01:49:43,291 --> 01:49:43,916
What good are you guys?

1915
01:49:44,416 --> 01:49:45,583
Come, Tenny. - Come, Lallu.

1916
01:49:46,083 --> 01:49:49,583
Already weak, and now pregnant! (old saying)

1917
01:49:54,958 --> 01:49:57,125
There's a scary security guard standing there, right?

1918
01:49:57,625 --> 01:49:58,750
How did you know that?

1919
01:49:59,250 --> 01:50:03,000
I can hear the fireworks in your chest over here.

1920
01:50:03,500 --> 01:50:07,000
How do we go?

1921
01:50:09,416 --> 01:50:10,541
Who's calling now?

1922
01:50:11,041 --> 01:50:11,791
This guy...

1923
01:50:12,291 --> 01:50:13,416
What is it? - Hey Lallu...

1924
01:50:13,916 --> 01:50:15,458
Is there any problem? Should we come?

1925
01:50:15,958 --> 01:50:19,333
If we know to come till here, we know how to get in as well.

1926
01:50:19,833 --> 01:50:22,000
We will do it on our own.

1927
01:50:22,500 --> 01:50:24,458
What did he say? - That they will do it on their own.

1928
01:50:24,958 --> 01:50:26,250
Is it Panjikkuttan? - Yes.

1929
01:50:26,750 --> 01:50:27,625
That punch dialogue was awesome.

1930
01:50:28,125 --> 01:50:29,958
I also wanted to retort to him. - This is the wall.

1931
01:50:30,458 --> 01:50:31,208
What is this? A women's wall?

1932
01:50:31,708 --> 01:50:32,416
Since it's a ladies' hostel.

1933
01:50:32,916 --> 01:50:33,916
Jump only after I also climb up.

1934
01:50:34,416 --> 01:50:36,208
Oh my God!

1935
01:50:36,708 --> 01:50:39,041
No one is around.

1936
01:50:39,541 --> 01:50:41,458
Jump!

1937
01:50:41,958 --> 01:50:44,333
Reached so fast? - I'm fed up of this guy.

1938
01:50:44,833 --> 01:50:46,208
Lallu, where are you?

1939
01:50:46,708 --> 01:50:47,333
You monkey!

1940
01:50:47,833 --> 01:50:48,875
Not that side. This side.

1941
01:50:49,375 --> 01:50:53,083
If you say that side, this side, here and there, it's all the same for me!

1942
01:50:53,583 --> 01:50:54,958
Full of darkness!

1943
01:50:55,458 --> 01:50:56,250
Oh my God!

1944
01:50:56,750 --> 01:50:57,333
Is there any problem?

1945
01:50:57,833 --> 01:50:59,416
If I leave you here alone, it will be a bigger problem.

1946
01:50:59,916 --> 01:51:00,708
Come on, jump.

1947
01:51:01,208 --> 01:51:03,083
There's no dung pit on the other side, right? - Dung pit?

1948
01:51:03,583 --> 01:51:05,666
Well, in movies when they jump over walls, it will be a dung pit on the other side.

1949
01:51:06,166 --> 01:51:07,458
Wait.

1950
01:51:07,958 --> 01:51:11,500
Jump, you idiot.

1951
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:13,125
A jack fruit has fallen.

1952
01:51:13,625 --> 01:51:14,375
Dude...

1953
01:51:14,875 --> 01:51:16,166
I'm leaving you near a tree.

1954
01:51:16,666 --> 01:51:18,833
If someone comes, you should hide behind this, okay?

1955
01:51:19,333 --> 01:51:20,875
So shouldn't I come?

1956
01:51:21,375 --> 01:51:23,458
Dude, you always turn to the opposite side.

1957
01:51:23,958 --> 01:51:25,625
You wait here. I'll go talk and come.

1958
01:51:26,125 --> 01:51:28,875
Then you go ahead. I'll signal if someone comes.

1959
01:51:29,375 --> 01:51:30,541
But how will you see them?

1960
01:51:31,041 --> 01:51:32,458
If someone comes, they will see me, right?

1961
01:51:32,958 --> 01:51:36,458
Then they would ask me who I am, right? - Just stay calm over here.

1962
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:05,500
Jesus!

1963
01:52:06,541 --> 01:52:10,041
It's not safe to stay here.

1964
01:52:14,458 --> 01:52:17,750
Hey Anu! We're going to Lachu's room. - Okay.

1965
01:52:18,250 --> 01:52:19,791
- An office trip is being planned. - Oh no!

1966
01:52:20,291 --> 01:52:23,625
- Is it? I hope they take us to a nice place.

1967
01:52:24,125 --> 01:52:26,625
Huh? Who left this open? - I don't know.

1968
01:52:27,125 --> 01:52:30,625
Lock it. - Yeah! Come!

1969
01:52:35,416 --> 01:52:38,916
I'm trapped!

1970
01:52:44,875 --> 01:52:46,250
Hello! - Dude!

1971
01:52:46,750 --> 01:52:48,208
Someone locked the room I got into, from outside.

1972
01:52:48,708 --> 01:52:50,125
Oh no! - Come without making nose open it.

1973
01:52:50,625 --> 01:52:51,833
Dude, how will I come there?

1974
01:52:52,333 --> 01:52:53,625
Climb the steps from where I left you.

1975
01:52:54,125 --> 01:52:55,500
Turn left, and then turn left again...

1976
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:56,791
and the last room.

1977
01:52:57,291 --> 01:52:58,000
Oh no!

1978
01:52:58,500 --> 01:53:00,583
I moved a little away from that place.

1979
01:53:01,083 --> 01:53:02,333
Around 1.5 kms from there.

1980
01:53:02,833 --> 01:53:03,458
1.5 kms?

1981
01:53:03,958 --> 01:53:04,708
Where?

1982
01:53:05,208 --> 01:53:06,125
I don't know that.

1983
01:53:06,625 --> 01:53:10,125
Anyway, I'm standing in a dark place.

1984
01:53:13,625 --> 01:53:15,666
Sigh!

1985
01:53:16,166 --> 01:53:18,708
Now I've to call Panjikkuttan to save me, shamelessly.

1986
01:53:19,208 --> 01:53:22,708
Panjikkuttan it is, then.

1987
01:53:24,166 --> 01:53:26,458
Just miss.

1988
01:53:26,958 --> 01:53:27,583
What is it?

1989
01:53:28,083 --> 01:53:29,250
Panjikkutta...

1990
01:53:29,750 --> 01:53:30,416
I'm trapped here.

1991
01:53:30,916 --> 01:53:31,458
Can you please come?

1992
01:53:31,958 --> 01:53:33,375
But didn't you say that you'll do it on your own?

1993
01:53:33,875 --> 01:53:34,583
I don't have any other way.

1994
01:53:35,083 --> 01:53:35,708
Please come.

1995
01:53:36,208 --> 01:53:37,333
Okay.

1996
01:53:37,833 --> 01:53:38,458
What is it?

1997
01:53:38,958 --> 01:53:39,875
Son...

1998
01:53:40,375 --> 01:53:42,250
It's time for your big brother to enter the arena.

1999
01:53:42,750 --> 01:53:44,000
They are trapped there.

2000
01:53:44,500 --> 01:53:48,000
What do we do now?

2001
01:54:12,458 --> 01:54:14,166
Call for an ambulance urgently.

2002
01:54:14,666 --> 01:54:17,583
Book 2 beds at the general hospital.

2003
01:54:18,083 --> 01:54:21,208
Ask them how much it costs to plaster broken bones!

2004
01:54:21,708 --> 01:54:23,333
Why? - Before we reach there,

2005
01:54:23,833 --> 01:54:25,333
they might get thrashed royally.

2006
01:54:25,833 --> 01:54:26,375
For a safety!

2007
01:54:26,875 --> 01:54:30,375
All set! Mission start now!

2008
01:54:36,666 --> 01:54:40,166
Wow!

2009
01:55:03,208 --> 01:55:03,750
We jumped over the wall.

2010
01:55:04,250 --> 01:55:05,291
Jumped? - Yes.

2011
01:55:05,791 --> 01:55:09,333
When you come straight, you can see a pipe.

2012
01:55:09,833 --> 01:55:13,083
Can't see anyone here.

2013
01:55:13,583 --> 01:55:14,166
Saw! Saw!

2014
01:55:14,666 --> 01:55:16,625
Where are the girls? I can't see them. - Not girls.

2015
01:55:17,125 --> 01:55:17,958
Then? - Tell me.

2016
01:55:18,458 --> 01:55:21,958
When you come forward from there, you'll see a staircase.

2017
01:55:24,541 --> 01:55:25,416
Saw it.

2018
01:55:25,916 --> 01:55:29,208
Climb up and come.

2019
01:55:29,708 --> 01:55:30,625
Come on!

2020
01:55:31,125 --> 01:55:36,416
Panjikkutta, did you see a photo of Jesus kept there when you come up?

2021
01:55:36,916 --> 01:55:39,291
Yes.

2022
01:55:39,791 --> 01:55:40,541
Praise be to the Lord. - Red Salute.

2023
01:55:41,041 --> 01:55:43,750
Turn left, and then left again, and then the last room.

2024
01:55:44,250 --> 01:55:48,291
Stop blabbering and say if it to this side or that side of Christ.

2025
01:55:48,791 --> 01:55:50,875
This side! - This side?

2026
01:55:51,375 --> 01:55:52,250
The last room!

2027
01:55:52,750 --> 01:55:56,250
Come.

2028
01:55:58,041 --> 01:56:01,541
Lallu!

2029
01:56:04,666 --> 01:56:08,166
Lallu!

2030
01:56:08,666 --> 01:56:09,666
This is the room.

2031
01:56:10,166 --> 01:56:12,958
Don't speak.

2032
01:56:13,458 --> 01:56:14,375
Hey!

2033
01:56:14,875 --> 01:56:16,208
Move away.

2034
01:56:16,708 --> 01:56:20,875
This is an operation!

2035
01:56:21,375 --> 01:56:23,458
Yeah!

2036
01:56:23,958 --> 01:56:24,625
Come carefully.

2037
01:56:25,125 --> 01:56:26,250
Why is it so dark? - Lallu...

2038
01:56:26,750 --> 01:56:30,083
Where are you, son?

2039
01:56:30,583 --> 01:56:34,083
Lallu...

2040
01:56:36,875 --> 01:56:41,625
I have a doubt that we came into the wrong hostel.

2041
01:56:42,125 --> 01:56:44,041
My dear marijuana friends...

2042
01:56:44,541 --> 01:56:45,458
There's a small correction.

2043
01:56:45,958 --> 01:56:48,500
That is, two young men who entered the..

2044
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,500
boys' hostel mistaking it as ladies' hostel.

2045
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:53,250
Enough!

2046
01:56:53,750 --> 01:56:54,458
Close the door.

2047
01:56:54,958 --> 01:56:57,000
Let's not be a disturbance to them. Let's go.

2048
01:56:57,500 --> 01:56:58,250
Not from outside.

2049
01:56:58,750 --> 01:56:59,458
From inside.

2050
01:56:59,958 --> 01:57:01,291
We don't smoke up.

2051
01:57:01,791 --> 01:57:04,458
We'll make you smoke. - Close the door!

2052
01:57:04,958 --> 01:57:05,458
No! No!

2053
01:57:05,958 --> 01:57:08,250
It's not like breaking your arm, when you break the ligament of your shin.

2054
01:57:08,750 --> 01:57:11,208
It would take minimum 2 years for you to step on the floor.

2055
01:57:11,708 --> 01:57:15,250
So, be careful. - Thank you, Doctor.

2056
01:57:15,750 --> 01:57:19,250
Close it. Let them begin their feast.

2057
01:57:36,166 --> 01:57:37,083
Where did you come from?

2058
01:57:37,583 --> 01:57:39,958
There's no one around here, man.

2059
01:57:40,458 --> 01:57:42,541
Let's go find that girl's room.

2060
01:57:43,041 --> 01:57:45,375
There are enough girls here to host an Attukal Pongala festival.

2061
01:57:45,875 --> 01:57:49,208
But I didn't see them. - Don't speak.

2062
01:57:49,708 --> 01:57:50,833
Swim on your knees. There's someone behind us.

2063
01:57:51,333 --> 01:57:54,000
I don't know how to swim.

2064
01:57:54,500 --> 01:57:56,333
Oh no! The way is over.

2065
01:57:56,833 --> 01:58:02,083
What all are you doing with me?

2066
01:58:02,583 --> 01:58:04,458
Come. - Dude!

2067
01:58:04,958 --> 01:58:08,458
It's Diya's room.

2068
01:58:17,375 --> 01:58:18,250
Aren't you calling her?

2069
01:58:18,750 --> 01:58:22,250
It's locked, you idiot.

2070
01:58:26,833 --> 01:58:29,041
Aren't you drinking tea?

2071
01:58:29,541 --> 01:58:30,416
I'd like to take it.

2072
01:58:30,916 --> 01:58:34,833
But I'm not able to move my hand.

2073
01:58:35,333 --> 01:58:35,916
Panjikkutta...

2074
01:58:36,416 --> 01:58:37,333
Aren't you eating the puffs?

2075
01:58:37,833 --> 01:58:39,041
I'd like to.

2076
01:58:39,541 --> 01:58:42,250
But all my teeth are shaking.

2077
01:58:42,750 --> 01:58:43,458
If I take one bite,

2078
01:58:43,958 --> 01:58:47,583
I think my teeth would come off and go in with the puffs to my intestine,

2079
01:58:48,083 --> 01:58:50,833
and would smile at me tomorrow morning.

2080
01:58:51,333 --> 01:58:51,958
Not good enough.

2081
01:58:52,458 --> 01:58:53,541
The cutlet is not good enough.

2082
01:58:54,041 --> 01:58:55,083
Call the supplier.

2083
01:58:55,583 --> 01:58:57,375
This is not good. - You need tea or coffee?

2084
01:58:57,875 --> 01:58:59,125
Hello! - Yes.

2085
01:58:59,625 --> 01:59:01,916
Haven't you declared that this is a beef cutlet?

2086
01:59:02,416 --> 01:59:04,333
But apart from the overflow of onions and cauliflower,

2087
01:59:04,833 --> 01:59:06,458
there's no presence of the meat!

2088
01:59:06,958 --> 01:59:10,250
I'll complain this to the consumer court.

2089
01:59:10,750 --> 01:59:11,250
Nonsense!

2090
01:59:11,750 --> 01:59:12,416
What?

2091
01:59:12,916 --> 01:59:14,333
Don't get thrashed by Vicky.

2092
01:59:14,833 --> 01:59:16,000
Haven't you had enough? - Hey!

2093
01:59:16,500 --> 01:59:17,583
That's not the supplier.

2094
01:59:18,083 --> 01:59:19,041
No? - No!

2095
01:59:19,541 --> 01:59:20,041
Aren't you eating?

2096
01:59:20,541 --> 01:59:22,083
Chetta, can you give me a straw? - Why?

2097
01:59:22,583 --> 01:59:23,208
To drink this tea.

2098
01:59:23,708 --> 01:59:25,458
When I'm here, would I let you drink through a straw?

2099
01:59:25,958 --> 01:59:26,583
Here.

2100
01:59:27,083 --> 01:59:27,666
Where is my tea?

2101
01:59:28,166 --> 01:59:30,000
Just a minute.

2102
01:59:30,500 --> 01:59:33,125
Here. Over here.

2103
01:59:33,625 --> 01:59:36,208
Check! - Are you playing?

2104
01:59:36,708 --> 01:59:37,250
Oh no!

2105
01:59:37,750 --> 01:59:39,083
Blistering barnacles!

2106
01:59:39,583 --> 01:59:40,333
Country fellows!

2107
01:59:40,833 --> 01:59:42,166
- Where is my tea?

2108
01:59:42,666 --> 01:59:44,208
It's been only one year since I joined here.

2109
01:59:44,708 --> 01:59:47,250
Diya Chechi is much senior to me.

2110
01:59:47,750 --> 01:59:50,458
The first one I met here,

2111
01:59:50,958 --> 01:59:55,625
and the one who gave me the guidance I needed, was Diya Chechi.

2112
01:59:56,125 --> 01:59:59,625
Hi.

2113
02:00:06,458 --> 02:00:08,333
Did you eat something, Kunjumani?

2114
02:00:08,833 --> 02:00:09,958
Then you go to sleep, dear.

2115
02:00:10,458 --> 02:00:12,250
Aunty will go for a round and come back soon.

2116
02:00:12,750 --> 02:00:16,250
We'll play after that, okay?

2117
02:00:19,083 --> 02:00:25,000
Will you pray to God for my disease to get cured, Diya aunty?

2118
02:00:25,500 --> 02:00:29,000
Will you also pray, aunty? - I will, dear.

2119
02:00:40,750 --> 02:00:42,375
Pray with this, dear.

2120
02:00:42,875 --> 02:00:46,375
All your diseases would be cured soon.

2121
02:01:04,625 --> 02:01:08,708
She's critical, right Chechi?

2122
02:01:09,208 --> 02:01:11,166
There are many complaints coming from 901.

2123
02:01:11,666 --> 02:01:13,375
Should we solve it ourselves,

2124
02:01:13,875 --> 02:01:17,375
or should we report it directly to the head?

2125
02:01:23,208 --> 02:01:25,583
Why are you praying at this time, Chechi?

2126
02:01:26,083 --> 02:01:28,333
Didn't we promise that child that we would pray for her?

2127
02:01:28,833 --> 02:01:29,750
Everyone will promise that they will pray.

2128
02:01:30,250 --> 02:01:31,916
But no on actually does it.

2129
02:01:32,416 --> 02:01:35,916
If we postpone the prayer, that's a huge debt.

2130
02:01:55,458 --> 02:01:57,458
Don't come here like this ever again.

2131
02:01:57,958 --> 02:01:59,416
If you come dressed like this, I won't say that you're my dad.

2132
02:01:59,916 --> 02:02:02,625
I'd only that you are a servant at my house.

2133
02:02:03,125 --> 02:02:04,041
Let me come home.

2134
02:02:04,541 --> 02:02:08,041
I'll burn all these old clothes.

2135
02:02:16,208 --> 02:02:19,625
The bank loan will be sanctioned by 15th.

2136
02:02:20,125 --> 02:02:21,833
And then, my salary too.

2137
02:02:22,333 --> 02:02:24,291
For the time being, mortgage this.

2138
02:02:24,791 --> 02:02:28,458
At least, let that test happen on time.

2139
02:02:28,958 --> 02:02:32,416
And yeah, buy a new shirt and mundu.

2140
02:02:32,916 --> 02:02:34,833
Did you eat something?

2141
02:02:35,333 --> 02:02:36,583
Eat on time okay?

2142
02:02:37,083 --> 02:02:40,291
Bye.

2143
02:02:40,791 --> 02:02:41,791
Who was that, Chechi?

2144
02:02:42,291 --> 02:02:45,458
My father.

2145
02:02:45,958 --> 02:02:48,875
When I was in 9th grade, dad fell down from his work site.

2146
02:02:49,375 --> 02:02:51,166
He has a slight problem with his spine.

2147
02:02:51,666 --> 02:02:54,791
But poor thing, he did all the jobs he could, to educate me.

2148
02:02:55,291 --> 02:02:59,958
Now he's tensed that mom's surgery has drawn close.

2149
02:03:00,458 --> 02:03:02,916
Chechi, aren't you scared to donate your kidney?

2150
02:03:03,416 --> 02:03:04,416
It's for my own mother, right?

2151
02:03:04,916 --> 02:03:08,416
Then why should I be scared?

2152
02:03:17,708 --> 02:03:19,208
Chetta...

2153
02:03:19,708 --> 02:03:20,750
I'm sure about one thing.

2154
02:03:21,250 --> 02:03:24,750
Chechi will definitely come back.

2155
02:03:30,250 --> 02:03:32,125
Was Diya in love with anyone?

2156
02:03:32,625 --> 02:03:33,291
No.

2157
02:03:33,791 --> 02:03:36,458
You know how many people from this hospital have proposed to her?

2158
02:03:36,958 --> 02:03:38,833
But Chechi didn't like any of them.

2159
02:03:39,333 --> 02:03:44,375
She used to say that she hasn't felt a special connection to anyone so far.

2160
02:03:44,875 --> 02:03:49,458
She's waiting, claiming that someone would come, whom she would like at first sight.

2161
02:03:49,958 --> 02:03:52,833
I don't know who you are, and what you have come for.

2162
02:03:53,333 --> 02:03:54,125
But somehow...

2163
02:03:54,625 --> 02:03:58,125
I felt like saying all this about Diya Chechi to you.

2164
02:04:07,833 --> 02:04:10,750
Diya Chechi says that she's waiting for someone, right?

2165
02:04:11,250 --> 02:04:14,750
That someone... is me.

2166
02:04:35,666 --> 02:04:39,000
'Her eyes are like the blue lake'

2167
02:04:39,500 --> 02:04:43,375
'My girl is as pretty as a golden shower tree'

2168
02:04:43,875 --> 02:04:48,125
'She is like a sweet, gentle breeze'

2169
02:04:48,625 --> 02:04:53,666
'We have been searching for each other, until now'

2170
02:04:54,166 --> 02:04:58,250
'While going far away, and when you see her'

2171
02:04:58,750 --> 02:05:02,375
'Whisper in her ears, that I would be by her side soon'

2172
02:05:02,875 --> 02:05:06,291
'O breeze... Gentle breeze'

2173
02:05:06,791 --> 02:05:10,291
'We have been searching for each other, until now'

2174
02:05:25,875 --> 02:05:29,458
'She came into the depths of my heart long ago'

2175
02:05:29,958 --> 02:05:34,416
'She's the girl I knew, without seeing her'

2176
02:05:34,916 --> 02:05:43,458
'She's the one who showered many dreams within me, like a bunch of fireflies'

2177
02:05:43,958 --> 02:05:48,041
'In many places, among many faces'

2178
02:05:48,541 --> 02:05:52,208
'I went in search of her, every single day'

2179
02:05:52,708 --> 02:05:56,750
'I would soon reach beside my pretty cuckoo'

2180
02:05:57,250 --> 02:06:00,625
'Her eyes are like the blue lake'

2181
02:06:01,125 --> 02:06:05,000
'My girl is as pretty as a golden shower tree'

2182
02:06:05,500 --> 02:06:09,708
'She is like a sweet, gentle breeze'

2183
02:06:10,208 --> 02:06:13,708
'We have been searching for each other, until now'

2184
02:06:29,250 --> 02:06:37,791
'I saved many things in my heart, to speak to her when we meet'

2185
02:06:38,291 --> 02:06:41,916
'Where is your nest, O pretty bird?'

2186
02:06:42,416 --> 02:06:46,875
'What's the name of the song that you sing?'

2187
02:06:47,375 --> 02:06:51,416
'Getting drenched in the rain of love all alone'

2188
02:06:51,916 --> 02:06:55,583
'I am coming to take you with me, my girl'

2189
02:06:56,083 --> 02:07:00,166
'Don't disappear without seeing me, O rainbow'

2190
02:07:00,666 --> 02:07:04,000
'Her eyes are like the blue lake'

2191
02:07:04,500 --> 02:07:08,541
'My girl is as pretty as a golden shower tree'

2192
02:07:09,041 --> 02:07:12,958
'She is like a sweet, gentle breeze'

2193
02:07:13,458 --> 02:07:16,958
'We have been searching for each other, until now'

2194
02:07:35,291 --> 02:07:35,958
Wait and watch.

2195
02:07:36,458 --> 02:07:39,250
Within just two days, I'll definitely see her.

2196
02:07:39,750 --> 02:07:43,208
Yes.

2197
02:07:43,708 --> 02:07:45,875
I've been wanting to ask you.

2198
02:07:46,375 --> 02:07:50,375
Everyone is teasing me saying that I'm crazy to go behind a girl I've never seen.

2199
02:07:50,875 --> 02:07:52,625
From the beginning, you're the only who has been supporting me.

2200
02:07:53,125 --> 02:07:57,166
Why? - Even if no one else sees it, I can see what's in your heart.

2201
02:07:57,666 --> 02:07:59,041
To love someone sincerely,

2202
02:07:59,541 --> 02:08:02,708
you don't need eyes, and you don't need to see that person too.

2203
02:08:03,208 --> 02:08:04,708
Tenny. - Yes.

2204
02:08:05,208 --> 02:08:10,000
Haven't you felt like seeing anyone till date?

2205
02:08:10,500 --> 02:08:12,750
Do you know something, Lallu?

2206
02:08:13,250 --> 02:08:15,833
When it comes to disabled kids like me...

2207
02:08:16,333 --> 02:08:21,250
our parents are the ones who suffer much more than us.

2208
02:08:21,750 --> 02:08:23,083
So...

2209
02:08:23,583 --> 02:08:27,250
I would like to see the faces of my dad and mom sometime.

2210
02:08:27,750 --> 02:08:31,250
Then you guys too.

2211
02:08:35,250 --> 02:08:36,291
So what if you can't see!

2212
02:08:36,791 --> 02:08:38,291
God has given you the talent to sing, right?

2213
02:08:38,791 --> 02:08:39,791
Little devil!

2214
02:08:40,291 --> 02:08:43,291
You're making lots of money by singing, right?

2215
02:08:43,791 --> 02:08:45,458
For my screechy song,

2216
02:08:45,958 --> 02:08:49,458
I know who gives 500 Rupees every time.

2217
02:08:52,125 --> 02:08:55,000
I know that you keep putting money into the box.

2218
02:08:55,500 --> 02:08:59,958
But I accept it proudly thinking that it is a reward for my talent.

2219
02:09:00,458 --> 02:09:01,083
Oh!

2220
02:09:01,583 --> 02:09:03,250
Don't stir the water. The fish won't bite the bait.

2221
02:09:03,750 --> 02:09:04,375
As if it bites otherwise!

2222
02:09:04,875 --> 02:09:05,708
Get lost, you skinny shark!

2223
02:09:06,208 --> 02:09:07,791
Get lost, you big shark!

2224
02:09:08,291 --> 02:09:11,083
Come.

2225
02:09:11,583 --> 02:09:13,583
Hold me - Okay.

2226
02:09:14,083 --> 02:09:15,375
My shoes are here, right?

2227
02:09:15,875 --> 02:09:16,458
Did you get it?

2228
02:09:16,958 --> 02:09:19,125
Got it.

2229
02:09:19,625 --> 02:09:21,458
Jesus. It's Jesna.

2230
02:09:21,958 --> 02:09:22,833
Then you guys talk.

2231
02:09:23,333 --> 02:09:25,916
I'll walk somewhere here, trip and fall.

2232
02:09:26,416 --> 02:09:28,458
Sit there and wear your shoes. I'll be right back.

2233
02:09:28,958 --> 02:09:31,333
Where?

2234
02:09:31,833 --> 02:09:35,458
Sit here.

2235
02:09:35,958 --> 02:09:39,416
No change in your decision, right?

2236
02:09:39,916 --> 02:09:40,541
Well...

2237
02:09:41,041 --> 02:09:44,541
... the spark...

2238
02:09:53,375 --> 02:09:56,958
It's my wedding next month.

2239
02:09:57,458 --> 02:10:01,166
I'm ready to wait forever for you to feel a spark in me.

2240
02:10:01,666 --> 02:10:02,541
But...

2241
02:10:03,041 --> 02:10:06,541
... my family won't let me.

2242
02:10:12,541 --> 02:10:13,583
But there's one thing.

2243
02:10:14,083 --> 02:10:19,000
Even if you call me a second before I get married,

2244
02:10:19,500 --> 02:10:23,000
I will come with you.

2245
02:10:27,208 --> 02:10:30,708
Sorry, dear.

2246
02:10:37,875 --> 02:10:39,583
What's this? What happened?

2247
02:10:40,083 --> 02:10:42,083
That's the stain of plum fruits falling on it.

2248
02:10:42,583 --> 02:10:43,291
Plum fruits?

2249
02:10:43,791 --> 02:10:45,458
Wow! Great!

2250
02:10:45,958 --> 02:10:49,291
When you went in search of plum fruits all over the world,

2251
02:10:49,791 --> 02:10:51,875
there was a plum fruit tree in my house as well.

2252
02:10:52,375 --> 02:10:54,833
You didn't see it though.

2253
02:10:55,333 --> 02:10:56,833
It will go away if you wash it.

2254
02:10:57,333 --> 02:10:58,000
It's a permanent stain.

2255
02:10:58,500 --> 02:11:00,208
It won't go if you wash it.

2256
02:11:00,708 --> 02:11:01,458
Shall I leave then?

2257
02:11:01,958 --> 02:11:05,458
'Brother'!

2258
02:11:08,750 --> 02:11:10,166
I got shocked seeing a nightmare last night.

2259
02:11:10,666 --> 02:11:12,708
What? - Both of us going for work.

2260
02:11:13,208 --> 02:11:14,458
Really? - Yes.

2261
02:11:14,958 --> 02:11:17,125
Was I in the dream? - Of course.

2262
02:11:17,625 --> 02:11:18,208
I'm not there.

2263
02:11:18,708 --> 02:11:19,958
I won't be there in any dream where I have to move my body.

2264
02:11:20,458 --> 02:11:21,250
Me too. - Chetta, Namaste.

2265
02:11:21,750 --> 02:11:22,625
20 Bonda (snack).

2266
02:11:23,125 --> 02:11:23,875
60 cups of tea.

2267
02:11:24,375 --> 02:11:25,250
20 Parippuvada (snack).

2268
02:11:25,750 --> 02:11:26,291
20 banana fritters.

2269
02:11:26,791 --> 02:11:27,625
Keep them ready.

2270
02:11:28,125 --> 02:11:31,250
If you calculate the amount, I'll pay right away.

2271
02:11:31,750 --> 02:11:33,916
It's better to shut shop than calculating so much. - Hey shopkeeper!

2272
02:11:34,416 --> 02:11:37,333
Why did you put out the fire?

2273
02:11:37,833 --> 02:11:39,791
None of them should be allowed into Kerala. - Chetta!

2274
02:11:40,291 --> 02:11:42,916
Is he going to jump into the lake, because his calculation went wrong?

2275
02:11:43,416 --> 02:11:44,875
Chetta...

2276
02:11:45,375 --> 02:11:46,291
Chetta!

2277
02:11:46,791 --> 02:11:48,750
This guy is good for nothing!

2278
02:11:49,250 --> 02:11:51,166
Ignoramus halfwits.

2279
02:11:51,666 --> 02:11:53,208
I won't give anything to Bengalis.

2280
02:11:53,708 --> 02:11:54,958
He's not Bengali. He's a Malangali. - There's a limit in eating.

2281
02:11:55,458 --> 02:11:58,083
We're so lucky that we were born as Malayalis. - Why?

2282
02:11:58,583 --> 02:12:02,041
If we were born as Bengalis, we'd have broken our backs working in some other state!

2283
02:12:02,541 --> 02:12:03,250
Oh no! - Yeah!

2284
02:12:03,750 --> 02:12:07,208
It would have been superb if there was a robot to do everything for us.

2285
02:12:07,708 --> 02:12:08,833
Then we don't have to do anything, right?

2286
02:12:09,333 --> 02:12:10,458
That won't work out. - Why?

2287
02:12:10,958 --> 02:12:12,666
Robot will have a switch. Shouldn't we switch it on and off?

2288
02:12:13,166 --> 02:12:14,208
Who will do that?

2289
02:12:14,708 --> 02:12:16,000
I won't do it. - I also won't do it.

2290
02:12:16,500 --> 02:12:17,250
What else can we do?

2291
02:12:17,750 --> 02:12:18,750
Do you have any problem in sitting like this?

2292
02:12:19,250 --> 02:12:22,333
No problem.

2293
02:12:22,833 --> 02:12:24,000
Too good, man!

2294
02:12:24,500 --> 02:12:27,083
Everyone has only really good things to say about that girl.

2295
02:12:27,583 --> 02:12:29,041
Anyway your selection is great.

2296
02:12:29,541 --> 02:12:31,708
Shall we try calling that SI?

2297
02:12:32,208 --> 02:12:33,791
I had called him.

2298
02:12:34,291 --> 02:12:35,666
No new information.

2299
02:12:36,166 --> 02:12:37,583
They said they will call me, if they find something.

2300
02:12:38,083 --> 02:12:39,583
Hey girl! Where are you?

2301
02:12:40,083 --> 02:12:44,458
Can't you come without troubling our Lallu in vain?

2302
02:12:44,958 --> 02:12:46,416
'Missing'

2303
02:12:46,916 --> 02:12:51,458
Isn't this that girl? - Which one?

2304
02:12:51,958 --> 02:12:52,458
Hey!

2305
02:12:52,958 --> 02:12:53,500
Why are you peeping?

2306
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:55,375
Haven't I told you not to peep? Loser!

2307
02:12:55,875 --> 02:12:57,250
Why are you getting angry?

2308
02:12:57,750 --> 02:12:58,416
She is missing?

2309
02:12:58,916 --> 02:13:02,416
We saw her even the other day - Of course.

2310
02:13:09,833 --> 02:13:11,875
Don't hurt him. - Where did you see her?

2311
02:13:12,375 --> 02:13:13,916
Is it this girl? - Yes.

2312
02:13:14,416 --> 02:13:15,375
Where?

2313
02:13:15,875 --> 02:13:16,666
Where was it?

2314
02:13:17,166 --> 02:13:18,125
2.0 is not good enough.

2315
02:13:18,625 --> 02:13:20,416
I don't think Rajnikanth would survive if he goes on like this.

2316
02:13:20,916 --> 02:13:22,541
Shooting someone with 500 guns?

2317
02:13:23,041 --> 02:13:25,625
I can't life a cane by myself here. - Didn't I say that we needn't go for the movie?

2318
02:13:26,125 --> 02:13:30,875
We wasted 3 hours which we could have idled away.

2319
02:13:31,375 --> 02:13:32,458
Dude!

2320
02:13:32,958 --> 02:13:35,250
What is this? - Get down.

2321
02:13:35,750 --> 02:13:37,125
Stop! Stop! - Don't go!

2322
02:13:37,625 --> 02:13:39,208
Take her to the hospital.

2323
02:13:39,708 --> 02:13:43,000
Come out.

2324
02:13:43,500 --> 02:13:44,958
Was it a serious injury?

2325
02:13:45,458 --> 02:13:46,958
No. I don't think it was serious.

2326
02:13:47,458 --> 02:13:48,333
It was just a minor fall.

2327
02:13:48,833 --> 02:13:50,416
And there are 3-4 hospitals nearby, right?

2328
02:13:50,916 --> 02:13:51,791
They would have admitted her there.

2329
02:13:52,291 --> 02:13:58,041
If you check some hospital near that place, you'll find her.

2330
02:13:58,541 --> 02:14:00,416
Nothing goes wasted in this world.

2331
02:14:00,916 --> 02:14:02,458
You both are diamonds!

2332
02:14:02,958 --> 02:14:04,291
Yaay! Yaay!

2333
02:14:04,791 --> 02:14:06,291
I got the fish! I got the fish!

2334
02:14:06,791 --> 02:14:07,375
I got the fish!

2335
02:14:07,875 --> 02:14:11,375
I got the fish!

2336
02:14:14,708 --> 02:14:15,375
Sister...

2337
02:14:15,875 --> 02:14:18,583
Is anyone by the name of Diya Francis admitted here?

2338
02:14:19,083 --> 02:14:20,791
Just a minute.

2339
02:14:21,291 --> 02:14:23,250
No.

2340
02:14:23,750 --> 02:14:27,250
Okay.

2341
02:14:28,708 --> 02:14:29,375
What happened, dude?

2342
02:14:29,875 --> 02:14:33,375
She's not here.

2343
02:14:34,750 --> 02:14:35,750
Come. - What happened?

2344
02:14:36,250 --> 02:14:39,750
Let's check at Fathima.

2345
02:14:41,083 --> 02:14:43,166
She won't be in any hospital.

2346
02:14:43,666 --> 02:14:44,750
If she is, her family would know first, right?

2347
02:14:45,250 --> 02:14:47,250
Then why would they give a missing ad on the paper?

2348
02:14:47,750 --> 02:14:50,083
Well, what if this girl is still unconscious?

2349
02:14:50,583 --> 02:14:51,250
Then her family won't know, right?

2350
02:14:51,750 --> 02:14:52,708
What if that's the case?

2351
02:14:53,208 --> 02:14:54,250
Hey! - She's calling you.

2352
02:14:54,750 --> 02:14:57,750
The girl who got admitted on 20th, is in 333, on the 3rd floor.

2353
02:14:58,250 --> 02:15:01,750
She'll get discharged today.

2354
02:15:31,958 --> 02:15:35,458
And finally, he's going to see his girl for the first time.

2355
02:15:47,791 --> 02:15:51,291
Who are you?

2356
02:16:08,208 --> 02:16:11,708
What happened?

2357
02:16:28,208 --> 02:16:29,375
Where is Lallu?

2358
02:16:29,875 --> 02:16:33,375
What happened?

2359
02:17:34,958 --> 02:17:38,458
Look at him seeing his girl for the first time!

2360
02:17:49,041 --> 02:17:50,583
After waiting for so long,

2361
02:17:51,083 --> 02:17:51,916
by the time I came,

2362
02:17:52,416 --> 02:17:55,916
you left?

2363
02:18:02,416 --> 02:18:04,875
It's a new shirt.

2364
02:18:05,375 --> 02:18:10,458
She doesn't like me wearing shabby old shirts. She'll scold me.

2365
02:18:10,958 --> 02:18:15,000
How is this? Nice, right?

2366
02:18:15,500 --> 02:18:16,583
Come.

2367
02:18:17,083 --> 02:18:20,583
Look at her lying there. Come and see.

2368
02:18:22,375 --> 02:18:25,875
Where were you?

2369
02:18:30,750 --> 02:18:34,500
She saved all her money because she really wanted a gold anklet.

2370
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:38,500
But she removed it and gave it to me, for her mother's surgery.

2371
02:18:41,583 --> 02:18:44,916
Wear this and go!

2372
02:18:45,416 --> 02:18:48,708
Wear this and go, my child!

2373
02:18:49,208 --> 02:18:53,750
Wear this and go!

2374
02:18:54,250 --> 02:18:58,000
My child!

2375
02:18:58,500 --> 02:19:02,000
My child!

2376
02:19:22,541 --> 02:19:25,208
Leave it.

2377
02:19:25,708 --> 02:19:27,916
I couldn't even talk to her once, Panjikkutta.

2378
02:19:28,416 --> 02:19:29,666
What can we do?

2379
02:19:30,166 --> 02:19:30,708
Forget it.

2380
02:19:31,208 --> 02:19:32,666
I cannot forget it so easily.

2381
02:19:33,166 --> 02:19:34,333
She's gone!

2382
02:19:34,833 --> 02:19:36,791
What can you do now?

2383
02:19:37,291 --> 02:19:38,250
Only she is gone!

2384
02:19:38,750 --> 02:19:40,208
My love for he hasn't gone.

2385
02:19:40,708 --> 02:19:42,541
What craziness are you talking?

2386
02:19:43,041 --> 02:19:44,708
It's been 12 years since Jancy Chechi died, right?

2387
02:19:45,208 --> 02:19:46,625
Isn't she in your heart even now?

2388
02:19:47,125 --> 02:19:50,333
Isn't she?

2389
02:19:50,833 --> 02:19:53,916
Like that, Diya is in my heart too.

2390
02:19:54,416 --> 02:19:58,791
That love would be with me, till I die.

2391
02:19:59,291 --> 02:20:02,791
Lallu...

2392
02:20:06,166 --> 02:20:08,375
Some car hit her and went without stopping.

2393
02:20:08,875 --> 02:20:11,250
She rolled down from the road. That's why no one spotted her.

2394
02:20:11,750 --> 02:20:14,375
She was identified from the mortuary this morning.

2395
02:20:14,875 --> 02:20:17,875
We're investigating for the car that hit her.

2396
02:20:18,375 --> 02:20:20,291
If you investigate, that car will never be found, sir.

2397
02:20:20,791 --> 02:20:22,666
What?

2398
02:20:23,166 --> 02:20:26,666
Aren't you Davis' uncle?

2399
02:20:28,875 --> 02:20:30,791
I'm not saying this because I'm an advocate's wife.

2400
02:20:31,291 --> 02:20:33,291
If it's foolishness, don't mind it.

2401
02:20:33,791 --> 02:20:35,666
If there's an accident case in any hospital,

2402
02:20:36,166 --> 02:20:37,791
they will inform the police station immediately.

2403
02:20:38,291 --> 02:20:40,458
Since we haven't got any such information from the station,

2404
02:20:40,958 --> 02:20:42,666
they haven't taken that girl to a hospital.

2405
02:20:43,166 --> 02:20:44,416
That's for sure.

2406
02:20:44,916 --> 02:20:45,458
Then?

2407
02:20:45,958 --> 02:20:48,375
Maybe, in the shock of the accident,

2408
02:20:48,875 --> 02:20:50,250
or out of the fear that a crowd would gather,

2409
02:20:50,750 --> 02:20:52,291
they would have taken that girl in their car.

2410
02:20:52,791 --> 02:20:56,916
Thinking about the complications they would have to face if something happens to her,

2411
02:20:57,416 --> 02:21:02,375
they would have abandoned her somewhere on the way.

2412
02:21:02,875 --> 02:21:04,083
Don't be tensed.

2413
02:21:04,583 --> 02:21:07,625
Ask those guys if they remember the car's number.

2414
02:21:08,125 --> 02:21:09,166
If we find that car,

2415
02:21:09,666 --> 02:21:13,166
we will find our girl too.

2416
02:21:14,791 --> 02:21:15,750
We didn't note the number.

2417
02:21:16,250 --> 02:21:16,958
Do you remember which car it was?

2418
02:21:17,458 --> 02:21:18,875
We didn't notice all that in the hurry.

2419
02:21:19,375 --> 02:21:21,000
Have you seen the guys in the car before?

2420
02:21:21,500 --> 02:21:23,708
I haven't seen them.

2421
02:21:24,208 --> 02:21:26,916
Think about it. Do you remember any other indication?

2422
02:21:27,416 --> 02:21:29,541
Any other indication?

2423
02:21:30,041 --> 02:21:30,750
Come.

2424
02:21:31,250 --> 02:21:32,708
Didn't you get something that day?

2425
02:21:33,208 --> 02:21:36,208
Take her to the hospital.

2426
02:21:36,708 --> 02:21:39,666
What's that?

2427
02:21:40,166 --> 02:21:42,041
Show that thing to Lallu.

2428
02:21:42,541 --> 02:21:45,375
You can't find which car it is if you see that.

2429
02:21:45,875 --> 02:21:46,458
What thing?

2430
02:21:46,958 --> 02:21:48,291
It's something that fell from that car.

2431
02:21:48,791 --> 02:21:50,750
I won't give that. I took it home.

2432
02:21:51,250 --> 02:21:51,916
Come with me.

2433
02:21:52,416 --> 02:21:53,166
Come on! - I won't give it.

2434
02:21:53,666 --> 02:21:55,250
Is it here? - I'll show it, but I won't give it to you.

2435
02:21:55,750 --> 02:21:56,333
Mom! - What is it?

2436
02:21:56,833 --> 02:21:58,916
It's here.

2437
02:21:59,416 --> 02:22:00,875
This is it.

2438
02:22:01,375 --> 02:22:02,458
I use it to prepare porridge.

2439
02:22:02,958 --> 02:22:05,666
I'll give it back now.

2440
02:22:06,166 --> 02:22:07,541
Isn't this the light ring of an Ambassador car?

2441
02:22:08,041 --> 02:22:09,250
Is it an Ambassador? An old car?

2442
02:22:09,750 --> 02:22:11,166
Yes. It was an old dirty car.

2443
02:22:11,666 --> 02:22:12,791
It was rusted on the outside.

2444
02:22:13,291 --> 02:22:14,000
That wasn't rust.

2445
02:22:14,500 --> 02:22:16,750
There was some stain on it. I had to wash my hands so much.

2446
02:22:17,250 --> 02:22:18,458
What can cause a stain on top of a car?

2447
02:22:18,958 --> 02:22:20,166
That was rust. - That was a stain.

2448
02:22:20,666 --> 02:22:23,375
Stain? - Cashew fruit, Banana, Plum fruit.

2449
02:22:23,875 --> 02:22:26,291
Cars lying under those trees would be stained.

2450
02:22:26,791 --> 02:22:29,125
If it has been lying there, without using it for a long time,

2451
02:22:29,625 --> 02:22:30,708
the stain would be quite bad.

2452
02:22:31,208 --> 02:22:35,833
Then it has to be re-painted.

2453
02:22:36,333 --> 02:22:38,250
After being hit by the car, she was lying here. Right?

2454
02:22:38,750 --> 02:22:42,250
Yes. Over here.

2455
02:22:46,375 --> 02:22:47,333
Get lost. That was rust.

2456
02:22:47,833 --> 02:22:48,875
That was a stain, man.

2457
02:22:49,375 --> 02:22:51,458
Didn't I see it? It was rust.

2458
02:22:51,958 --> 02:22:53,291
You idiot. That was a stain.

2459
02:22:53,791 --> 02:22:57,291
It was rust! - No!

2460
02:23:03,750 --> 02:23:06,041
That's the stain of plum fruits which fell on top of it.

2461
02:23:06,541 --> 02:23:10,041
Plum fruit?

2462
02:23:16,375 --> 02:23:17,916
There are some lying on top of that car.

2463
02:23:18,416 --> 02:23:19,250
Let me take them as well.

2464
02:23:19,750 --> 02:23:23,250
Dude, Lallu... Come back.

2465
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,708
Who is it?

2466
02:23:33,208 --> 02:23:33,833
I... this car...

2467
02:23:34,333 --> 02:23:37,166
Cleetus had told me that you would come yesterday.

2468
02:23:37,666 --> 02:23:39,041
The car is in top condition.

2469
02:23:39,541 --> 02:23:40,416
Single-owner.

2470
02:23:40,916 --> 02:23:42,250
Since I wasn't in Kerala,

2471
02:23:42,750 --> 02:23:44,625
no one really uses this car.

2472
02:23:45,125 --> 02:23:48,625
It became so dirty lying here like this.

2473
02:23:49,125 --> 02:23:50,333
Where's the ring of this light?

2474
02:23:50,833 --> 02:23:52,583
That's gone?

2475
02:23:53,083 --> 02:23:57,125
Davis would have taken it and hit it somewhere.

2476
02:23:57,625 --> 02:23:58,291
He is my grandson.

2477
02:23:58,791 --> 02:24:02,291
He's the one who uses this once in a while.

2478
02:24:11,291 --> 02:24:12,791
Where is this Davis now?

2479
02:24:13,291 --> 02:24:16,791
Look!

2480
02:24:39,041 --> 02:24:40,875
Aren't you that Davis' uncle?

2481
02:24:41,375 --> 02:24:44,708
What the hell is wrong with you?

2482
02:24:45,208 --> 02:24:49,041
To be so enraged, who's that girl to you?

2483
02:24:49,541 --> 02:24:50,416
The girl I am in love with.

2484
02:24:50,916 --> 02:24:55,416
Oh no! Don't take my daughter away!

2485
02:24:55,916 --> 02:24:59,541
Even now?

2486
02:25:00,041 --> 02:25:02,708
When I let you go thinking that you're a fool,

2487
02:25:03,208 --> 02:25:05,958
who's after a girl you have never seen...

2488
02:25:06,458 --> 02:25:09,583
You decided to mess with me, huh?

2489
02:25:10,083 --> 02:25:11,166
Yes.

2490
02:25:11,666 --> 02:25:15,583
It was Davis' car which hit her.

2491
02:25:16,083 --> 02:25:18,375
Now do you want to know how she died?

2492
02:25:18,875 --> 02:25:22,500
I'll tell you that as well.

2493
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:23,833
Give me the medicine.

2494
02:25:24,333 --> 02:25:25,833
No, son. No point in asking me again and again.

2495
02:25:26,333 --> 02:25:27,041
I won't give it.

2496
02:25:27,541 --> 02:25:28,333
It's not right.

2497
02:25:28,833 --> 02:25:30,500
The guys who smoke marijuana and get their eyes red,

2498
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:32,250
are pouring this medicine in their eyes.

2499
02:25:32,750 --> 02:25:34,416
So the police has told us not to give us the medicine

2500
02:25:34,916 --> 02:25:35,916
without the doctor's prescription.

2501
02:25:36,416 --> 02:25:37,875
Give the medicine, Chechi.

2502
02:25:38,375 --> 02:25:39,750
I won't give it without a prescription!

2503
02:25:40,250 --> 02:25:41,416
Get going. - Here you go, Chechi.

2504
02:25:41,916 --> 02:25:43,458
Give me these medicines. - Okay.

2505
02:25:43,958 --> 02:25:47,291
Give the medicine, I say!

2506
02:25:47,791 --> 02:25:48,583
Hey Chetta...

2507
02:25:49,083 --> 02:25:50,083
The hospital is nearby.

2508
02:25:50,583 --> 02:25:51,750
Take a token, meet the doctor.

2509
02:25:52,250 --> 02:25:56,500
If you bring a prescription, she will give you the medicine.

2510
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:57,708
And yeah...

2511
02:25:58,208 --> 02:26:00,750
Don't speak disrespectfully to ladies of your mother's age.

2512
02:26:01,250 --> 02:26:04,333
You also have a mother, right?

2513
02:26:04,833 --> 02:26:05,750
Just think about her.

2514
02:26:06,250 --> 02:26:09,750
It will be all right then.

2515
02:26:12,625 --> 02:26:13,375
Are you going home today?

2516
02:26:13,875 --> 02:26:17,375
No, Chechi. I'll go tomorrow.

2517
02:26:21,958 --> 02:26:24,250
- 'You also have a mother, right? Just think about her.'

2518
02:26:24,750 --> 02:26:26,375
- 'You don't look anything like your dad'

2519
02:26:26,875 --> 02:26:30,375
- 'Davis!' - 'Mom!' - 'My son!'

2520
02:27:04,208 --> 02:27:07,708
Start the car.

2521
02:27:20,291 --> 02:27:23,791
Come on!

2522
02:27:33,750 --> 02:27:34,750
Dude!

2523
02:27:35,250 --> 02:27:38,750
Dude, what are you doing?

2524
02:27:41,708 --> 02:27:43,083
We're in trouble. - Look!

2525
02:27:43,583 --> 02:27:46,375
Dude, there are people.

2526
02:27:46,875 --> 02:27:48,625
Come fast.

2527
02:27:49,125 --> 02:27:50,916
Pick her up. - Let's go!

2528
02:27:51,416 --> 02:27:53,958
Stop the car! - Take her to the hospital.

2529
02:27:54,458 --> 02:27:56,333
Get out. - Come on, get out.

2530
02:27:56,833 --> 02:28:00,458
Take her to the hospital.

2531
02:28:00,958 --> 02:28:04,666
Lift her up.

2532
02:28:05,166 --> 02:28:06,833
Come on, lift.

2533
02:28:07,333 --> 02:28:11,291
Take her to the back seat.

2534
02:28:11,791 --> 02:28:14,000
Hold her from that side.

2535
02:28:14,500 --> 02:28:18,000
Move.

2536
02:28:19,375 --> 02:28:22,875
Go straight to the hospital.

2537
02:28:30,458 --> 02:28:34,291
Mom!

2538
02:28:34,791 --> 02:28:35,625
Mom!

2539
02:28:36,125 --> 02:28:37,500
- 'Don't talk to me, mom! Get lost'

2540
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:39,583
- 'You don't look anything like your dad'

2541
02:28:40,083 --> 02:28:44,791
- 'Don't you know when you see him? He is Rajan's son.'

2542
02:28:45,291 --> 02:28:46,208
- 'Davis!'

2543
02:28:46,708 --> 02:28:48,583
- 'Who's your actual father?'

2544
02:28:49,083 --> 02:28:50,500
Stop the car! - Why?

2545
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:54,500
Stop the car, I say!

2546
02:29:33,625 --> 02:29:35,875
Do you want to know anything more?

2547
02:29:36,375 --> 02:29:38,541
Yes. They did it.

2548
02:29:39,041 --> 02:29:44,000
You won't be able to do jack-@$@% against them!

2549
02:29:44,500 --> 02:29:46,166
You did so much investigation, right?

2550
02:29:46,666 --> 02:29:47,541
Go and catch them.

2551
02:29:48,041 --> 02:29:50,375
I'll charge a case then.

2552
02:29:50,875 --> 02:29:53,125
They are at the quarry colony.

2553
02:29:53,625 --> 02:29:56,000
Go and catch them!

2554
02:29:56,500 --> 02:29:57,625
Go ahead!

2555
02:29:58,125 --> 02:30:01,625
Go and catch them, if you are a man!

2556
02:30:05,541 --> 02:30:08,375
Hey kiddo!

2557
02:30:08,875 --> 02:30:11,500
Are you going to quarry colony?

2558
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,875
That's not a colony. It's a fort.

2559
02:30:15,375 --> 02:30:17,333
Quarry Abba's fort.

2560
02:30:17,833 --> 02:30:20,500
Once you enter, you cannot come out.

2561
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:22,791
I will go there.

2562
02:30:23,291 --> 02:30:25,375
And I'll catch them and bring them to you!

2563
02:30:25,875 --> 02:30:29,375
You heard me? You @%@%

2564
02:31:15,791 --> 02:31:18,375
So you're the kiddo that sir told me about?

2565
02:31:18,875 --> 02:31:19,458
Hey!

2566
02:31:19,958 --> 02:31:21,708
Long back, in a case where I chopped a head off,

2567
02:31:22,208 --> 02:31:23,916
this Karikken sir was the one who got us acquitted.

2568
02:31:24,416 --> 02:31:28,708
So when sir requests something, shouldn't we stand by his side?

2569
02:31:29,208 --> 02:31:29,708
Get going.

2570
02:31:30,208 --> 02:31:30,750
Go!

2571
02:31:31,250 --> 02:31:34,750
Scram!

2572
02:31:39,708 --> 02:31:40,416
Hey!

2573
02:31:40,916 --> 02:31:43,250
After creating trouble in this quarry colony,

2574
02:31:43,750 --> 02:31:46,083
no one has ever gone back alive!

2575
02:31:46,583 --> 02:31:49,333
So many dogs and cats are hit by cars on the road....

2576
02:31:49,833 --> 02:31:53,333
Because of that...

2577
02:38:01,500 --> 02:38:03,041
So sir, here are the culprits and the witnesses.

2578
02:38:03,541 --> 02:38:05,708
Won't you charge a case now?

2579
02:38:06,208 --> 02:38:09,791
Your ever-rolling trophy for protecting the culprits destroying the evidence,

2580
02:38:10,291 --> 02:38:11,458
is on the way from the top!

2581
02:38:11,958 --> 02:38:13,041
It will come now. - You rascal!

2582
02:38:13,541 --> 02:38:17,041
Hey! Hey!

2583
02:38:18,291 --> 02:38:21,791
[murmuring]

2584
02:38:25,083 --> 02:38:26,625
Dude, it's section 353.

2585
02:38:27,125 --> 02:38:28,708
For hitting a policeman in uniform. - That's all?

2586
02:38:29,208 --> 02:38:30,708
Of course.

2587
02:38:31,208 --> 02:38:32,875
Well, there shouldn't be any blood.

2588
02:38:33,375 --> 02:38:36,875
That will be a different section!

2589
02:38:42,750 --> 02:38:46,250
Hey! Hey!

2590
02:38:49,583 --> 02:38:52,708
I don't know who you are, and why you are doing all this.

2591
02:38:53,208 --> 02:38:54,875
But if you weren't there,

2592
02:38:55,375 --> 02:38:58,000
I wouldn't even know what happened to my daughter.

2593
02:38:58,500 --> 02:39:00,041
What do I say...

2594
02:39:00,541 --> 02:39:03,833
Ever since she left,

2595
02:39:04,333 --> 02:39:05,708
there's someone who's paralyzed inside.

2596
02:39:06,208 --> 02:39:07,541
Her mother.

2597
02:39:08,041 --> 02:39:11,541
She wanted to see you when you come here.

2598
02:39:15,291 --> 02:39:18,791
Annamma...

2599
02:39:37,916 --> 02:39:39,750
Don't worry, mom.

2600
02:39:40,250 --> 02:39:41,458
I'll be there for you.

2601
02:39:41,958 --> 02:39:45,458
Always, as your own son.

2602
02:40:17,833 --> 02:40:21,000
Lallu, come. Let's go.

2603
02:40:21,500 --> 02:40:25,000
You guys leave.

2604
02:40:27,041 --> 02:40:28,166
So sad, right?

2605
02:40:28,666 --> 02:40:33,708
That girl didn't know that there was someone who loved her so much, in this world.

2606
02:40:34,208 --> 02:40:38,791
And he wasn't lucky enough to see her alive.

2607
02:40:39,291 --> 02:40:42,541
Would they have seen each other sometime?

2608
02:40:43,041 --> 02:40:46,541
Don't cut your hair, okay?

2609
02:41:11,708 --> 02:41:13,166
Give my ball back.

2610
02:41:13,666 --> 02:41:14,208
What's your name?

2611
02:41:14,708 --> 02:41:16,333
Kunjumani. My actual name is Sandra.

2612
02:41:16,833 --> 02:41:17,750
What's your name, uncle?

2613
02:41:18,250 --> 02:41:19,458
My name is Lallu.

2614
02:41:19,958 --> 02:41:21,958
Actual name?

2615
02:41:22,458 --> 02:41:25,958
Actual name...

2616
02:41:29,625 --> 02:41:33,083
Mohanlal John Kombanayil.

2617
02:41:33,583 --> 02:41:38,458
But you look like Mammootty!

2618
02:41:38,958 --> 02:41:40,750
Dear... Come! Let's go!

2619
02:41:41,250 --> 02:41:44,750
Here you go! - Thanks.

2620
02:41:56,333 --> 02:41:57,833
The word of the Lord came to me, saying,

2621
02:41:58,333 --> 02:42:02,208
Before I formed you in the womb I knew you...

2622
02:42:02,708 --> 02:42:05,458
and before you were born, I set you apart

2623
02:42:05,958 --> 02:42:09,125
and appointed you a prophet to the nations.
