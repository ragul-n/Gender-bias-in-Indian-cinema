Sweetheart shikdum - shikdum

00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:58,011
Windows wish curtains...

17
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,195
What's your crib?

18
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:18,796
Why are you evasive?

19
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:20,973
Crazy you

20
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:23,301

Only kisses and cuddles

24
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:20,794
Okay, okay I give up

25
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,928

26
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:31,305
Don't talk... this moment away

27
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:35,741
Then lose yourself in me

28
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:46,416
Sweetheart shikdum - shikdum

29
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:41,442

00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:44,608
Yes go on

31
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:48,119
What?

32
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:50,121
When?

33
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:53,951
Okay coming

34
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:00,965
Stupid

35
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:01,792
Cruel

36
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:04,299
Work-work-and-work all the time

37
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:05,470
and no time for me

38
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:06,467
So why do I bother?

39
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:07,506
Don't you get back home

40
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:09,804
Don't come back to me

41
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:13,007
Reporting from Marine Drive

42
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:14,509
A Safeguard security van

43
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:15,840
was ambushed here

44
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:17,845
Suspects are members

45
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,517
of a four-biker gang...

46
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:22,187
who allegedly pulled off heists
like this one

47
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:24,522
Where?

48
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:27,684
In there

49
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:29,353
In there what?

50
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:32,027
TV wallah?

51
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:34,697
Mechanic?

52
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:41,703
Yes, everyone around is a policeman
This is a police barrier

53
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:45,703
EXpected tomorrow. Come later

54
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:52,407
Four bikes sir. Imported

55
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:57,822
There was a police patrol
at the intersection

56
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:01,856
Some malfunction
in traffic signaling...

57
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,958
still malfunctioning

58
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:07,232
What...?

59
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:11,430
Find a computer eXpert.
Check out the signal

60
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:14,406
May have been tampered
by someone in that gang

61
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:18,744
Not tough. Little chip.

62
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:20,578
Anyone can reset timings

63
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:25,072
Sir... I only heard about you.

64
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:28,754
Now I see... sorry sir...

65
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:30,751
I didn't Quite make you out.

66
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:32,588
And you'll make out thieves?

67
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:38,288
Who are the guys
who'd use bikes like those?

68
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:42,434
Catch one

69
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:44,403
You've caught them all

70
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:14,462
Where's Ali Bhai?
(Bhai: Big brother)

71
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:16,096
Trailing

72
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:43,320

75
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,335
You're a loser, kid

76
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:52,386
You cracked every record.
Fencing the bike...

77
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:55,123
couldn't have cashed so much.
- Yes

78
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:59,564
Now let's have a fun party

79
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:05,740
What's problem with me?

80
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,669
Why won't ladies give me looks?

81
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:13,078
They're Just sisters
cheering their loser brothers

82
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:16,417
Rotten bad luck.
God gives everything

83
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:19,250
but this mess up in
ladies' department

84
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,652
Even I want to become

00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:22,755
Sure

86
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:26,421

Great sense of humour

102
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:37,836

103
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:49,844

105
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:54,352

110
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:04,862
Job or wife?

111
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:11,529
Lunch on time or heartburn.

112
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:13,231
Radish-in-bread

113
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:15,703
Yogurt shake in the flask.

114
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:17,372
Not for charity

115
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:19,043
Isn't worth the pain when I'm told

116
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:20,438
that you never got to eat any

117
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:21,671
Bye baby

118
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:22,542
Okay. Listen...

121
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,309
Listen...

122
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:41,794
Come on Sweety

123
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:45,335
My sweet baby bye

124
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:55,470
Who do you think you are?

125
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:58,746
One lifetime in Jail...

126
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:00,578
then you might improve

127
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:01,252
What?

128
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,918
Don't what me. If I didn't stop you

129
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:05,420
you'd run over this poor soul

130
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:07,592
But it isn't hurt, is it?

131
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:09,624
What'd you do after it got hurt?

132
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:11,592
If an accident never happened

133
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:13,424
never means accidents never happen

134
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:15,930
Okay, my mistake. Now what?

135
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:17,693
Say sorry to it
- What...?

136
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,438
He won't say sorry to a man

137
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,368
who escaped a brush with his car?

138
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:24,503
Correct. Sorry, you must say

139
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:26,634
Sorry

140
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:31,749
Hello... anyone heard anything?
- No - I said it...

141
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:35,751
You should say amiably, right?
- Okay

142
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,192
Sorry

143
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:43,685
Loathes even your sorry

00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:45,796
Save the dog.

145
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:48,731
Dog bhai... stop

146
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,204
Why are you staring darling?

147
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:03,879
As long as I'm around
nothing's happening to you

148
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:05,308
Don't be afraid.

149
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,079

Why does this happen
...to me all the time?

174
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:46,743
What've you brought home?

175
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,987
Darling? You call him that?

176

Because he's so cute

177
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:55,123
poor little thing
was out on the streets

178
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,268
I've put up with all kinds
of animals for your sake.

179
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:07,101
But I never imagined...
you'd pick up a guy off the streets.

180
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:08,272
Guy...?

181
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:15,204
How silly of me; no not he, darling.

182
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,539
Darling's him. He's Ali, poor thing

183
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:19,473
How true... no?

184
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,286
Hello

00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:45,032
Promise - Yes sure

191
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:50,140
You'll want the boX back?
- Whenever you come neXt time

192
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:57,920
Bye Darling

193
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:04,328
poor soul - poor...?

194
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:08,189
I think your Ali has thief
written all over his face

195
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:12,064
God! Will you ever change?

196
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:14,339
You're always suspecting everyone

197
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:18,202
And it's terrible of you
and I've told you that

198
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:23,840
Good morning sir

199
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:37,862
He's... He's Ali.

200
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:39,223
Operates out of a garage in Bandra

201
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:40,758
Quick on bikes

202
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:44,869
And a thief? Sure?

203
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,095
Sure sir! I trailed him for two days.

204
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:49,639
Also fences stolen bikes

205
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:52,969
I'm sure he belongs to the gang

206
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:06,383
Ali's Bike point, Bandra Lake

207
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:08,582
Red CBR Fireblade

208
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:13,556
Blue CBR

209
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,067
Someone rapping?

210
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:23,233
How are you?
- Cool. And you?

211
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:28,738
Carrot souffle. From Sweety

212
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:35,142
Send in two teas. Special

213
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:36,944
Nice

214
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:41,816
Fond of bikes?

215
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:42,752
Sure

216
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:44,421
On bikes, he'll work any original into...

217
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:46,961
a more powerful machine - Really?

218
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:50,768
Makes Ali Bhai world-famous in Mumbai.

219
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,433
You never told him...?
Your bikes...

220
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:54,161
Calm up

221
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:56,633
Yaks crap

222
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:02,776
Then you're also a biker?

223
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:06,041
Biker? He makes a bike fly.

224
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:09,977
No touchdowns, Ali's bikes fly

225
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:11,180
He Just won a race.

226
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:12,457
On that bike...

227
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:14,625
2 km lead... left the rest clutching

228
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:22,965
You mean, here's the fastest bike?

229
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:26,296
In Ali Bhai's hands...
- It is

230
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:27,394
Can I?

231
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:36,537
A bike interest?
- Yes of course

232
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:41,551
Been mulling over buying a bike,
fast racing-type

233
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:45,081
And Sweety likes bikes too

234
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:51,090
Want a bike?

235
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:53,687
Why not?

236
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:57,334
But I want a new bike. Fast

237
00:23:58,703 --> 00:23:59,567
Fast, like this

238
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:03,435
New, but... no papers
Will do?

239
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:05,698
No papers? Means?

240
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:07,572
You want to ride a bike or papers?

241
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:09,013
Takes two minutes to make paper

242
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:13,010
But where's the bike?

243
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:15,276
Right here. You'll find anything

244
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:16,919
Hi Rafik, all fine?

245
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:19,519
If you're new in Mumbai
you won't know.

246
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:21,191
Here's Flea Market

247
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:23,190
Only name more famous than mine

248
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:24,187
Out of my way

249
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:36,935
Stay here. Be Quiet. - Why?

250
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,071
Around here everyone's a
loose cannon

251
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:45,611
Speak no evil, hear no evil.
- And you?

252
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:49,409
I got source codes, my settings

253
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,148
No one's afraid of the police?

254
00:24:55,093 --> 00:25:00,292
Bloody copper who walks in here
leaves his neck behind

255
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:04,493
Afraid? Worry not.

256
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:06,566
So long as you're staring
at only dirt...

257
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:08,966
nothing happens to you.
I'll be back

258
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,121
Sharp?

259
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:31,258
Or blind?

260
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:34,598
Who are you eyeballing?

261
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,098
Eyes down... Down

262
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:40,270
In dirt Don't... turn me on

263
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:42,997
One flick Lands you over there

264
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:45,109
Do it

265
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,870
What? Come again

266
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:49,438
Slap me

267
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:52,010
He's mad!

268
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:54,011
Doesn't know who he's taking on

269
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:06,354
I'll save him after the first few
Stay right here

270
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:33,715
Want to take on Mad Anwar?

271
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:36,152
If you're not a bastard son.
You'll wait.

272
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:39,057
I'll kill you... right now Run

273
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:55,135
What?

274
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,346
Run

275
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:03,949
Run

276
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:42,377
You're in Shetty's gang? - Who...?

277
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:45,046
Or Manchekar? Rodrick's? Billu?

278
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:48,785
Which gang do you work for?
- Copper gang

279
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:53,320
Cop... you? Shrunk him in one swipe

280
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:55,522
...no such spunk in cops

281
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:58,802
Ever faced off cops?

282
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:02,105
Spent my life making ass of cops

283
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:05,737
Whatever you want to make,
never make a cop

284
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,807
One Quirk. How you got this
interest in bikes?

285
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:14,314
Come clean, yes?
Any idea on bank-loot?

286
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:17,484
No! Too scared of the police

287
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:19,751
Cops? Can never catch up.

288
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:22,549
Never fear so long as
Ali rides even a bicycle

289
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:25,830
Is it! Some faith in yourself

290
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:30,425
I trust a cop not to catch a thief
when he knows a thief.

291
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:34,436
Stupid

292
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:40,166
These policemen are so stupid...
so damn stupid

293
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:42,846
Go right in - They're fun.

294
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:46,505
Once I conned this one
...shined him bright

295
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:49,849
That was one solid wallop,

296
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:50,850
I'll give you that

297
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:51,855
pull over

298
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:00,258
What's this Joint?

299
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:02,597
My office

300
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:09,703
You're police?

301
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:13,073
No. Hitter

302
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:25,048
Scribble - What?

303
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:27,884
How long you've been stealing,

304
00:30:28,092 --> 00:30:31,152
dens, hideaways, accomplices, etc.,
come on

305
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:34,493
Right from start
I had doubts about you.

306
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:37,734
I save you and you give me
a back-kick?

307
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:41,071
We're both short of time

308
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:43,233
Admit your guilt

309
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:46,577
I'll try a plea bargain

310
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:50,012
Hey sahib... wrong rhyme.
I'm no thief

311
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:53,516
Look, I'm being even with you.

312
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:56,079
Just tell me what you're planning

313
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:57,751
Who are the others in your gang?

314
00:30:58,122 --> 00:31:00,420
Only Chhotu, Munna and Vinod

315
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:02,760
Vinod is green,
can't even ride a bike,

316
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:04,651
how can I pull off a heist?

317
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:06,930
Look you can't harass me
Not like this...

318
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:08,598
why is he taking off his specs?

319
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,598
Stop him, no illegal act

320
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:13,100
Stop chatting the phone. - Ali...

321
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:19,269
Look I'm losing my mind Your plans
NeXt robbery. When?

322
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:20,774
No idea, sahib

323
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:25,779
NeXt heist - Happened

324
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,617
NeXt robbery... - Just happened

325
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:28,444
What?

326
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:31,451
A robbery. A while ago. In Andheri

327
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:37,278
Taking the highway

328
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:03,031
Welcome to pizza place

329
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:04,634
What will you have?

330
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:10,606
Good evening sir

331
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:22,050
Any leads Jai? Any clues?

332
00:34:25,663 --> 00:34:29,292
Camera locations, police positions,

333
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,967
our reaction times,
they knew everything

334
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:33,800
They left no clues

335
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:35,639
They're professionals

336
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:40,467
Jai, what's happening?
This is too much

337
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:44,803
Getting away with daylight robbery

338
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:47,074
...it's a slur on us

339
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:53,316
Sir, I think we're going wrong.
- How?

340
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,156
All along we were thinking
like policemen.

341
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:00,220
Now... we got to think like thieves.

342
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,101
If they're sharp,
we got to get sharper

343
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:07,671
They use bikes for getaways

344
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:13,768
We use bikes to get them
But our riders are on it.

345
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:15,242
Not our men

346
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:17,841
Someone else. - Who?

347
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:26,349
Jai hit you?
- Who else?

348
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:30,592
And I tell you this, please don't mind.

349
00:35:31,395 --> 00:35:32,362
For what law-abiding
policeman he is...

350
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:33,689
he's really a hood

351
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:36,696
Such a terrible grinding.
- Don't be afraid

352
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:38,695
I'll give him a hollering.
Let him come

353
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:39,528
I'm not staying on.

354
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:41,204
He'll put me through the grind again

355
00:35:41,405 --> 00:35:43,373
If he lets go, I lose face value.
I'm Quitting

356
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:45,599
My home is no Jailhouse.

357
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:47,271
He'll face me if he touches you

358
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:51,613
Meanwhile, carrot souffle. EXcuse me

359
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,751
I knew I'd find you here

360
00:35:58,089 --> 00:35:59,716
Just returning the boX. Bye.

361
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:01,551
Come. Where're you going?

362
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:02,623
Carrot souffle before you leave?

363
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:04,826
What's coming over you?

364
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:08,565
Not another con?

365
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:09,391
Who is it?

366
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:14,560
Shall I tell Sweety that you
fence stolen bikes?

367
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:19,736
She despises thieves.

368
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:24,509
If she knows, no more carrot,
only stick

369
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:27,641
No entry for you in here
- Who's there?

370
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:29,643
Jai...

371
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:32,585
big brother

372
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:36,252
Jai, what's this I hear?
You hit Ali?

373
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:39,756
I... can I hit anybody?

374
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:45,330
I hit you? - No

375
00:36:45,803 --> 00:36:48,101
I fell off the bike

376
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:51,805
Why would I hit this poor guy?

377
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:54,270
He didn't get what I was getting at

378
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:57,276
I took him to the police station
because he's working for me

379
00:36:57,982 --> 00:37:00,780
Yes, I was telling him
how he can help us

380
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:02,111
For that I took him to the
police station

381
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,288
But poor guy got me all wrong

382
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:07,621
How wonderful Ali,

383
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:09,122
you're scared for nothing

384
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:11,290
Great Jai

385
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:14,297
See Ali? Jai isn't all that ugly

386
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:15,962
he'll take good care of you

387
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:18,297
Darling, let's go inside

388
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:21,972
Good care of me...

389
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:27,801
sums all my fears
Working for you? Doing what?

390
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:28,975
I'm doing nothing

391
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,147
You guys work life's dangers.

392
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:32,316
I'm not into it

393
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:35,310
For you

394
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:43,322
Sweety gets to see it; then others

395
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:48,495
Getting at what, big brother?
For a minimum of 3 years...

396
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,828
your boys get to manage your garage.

397
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:54,671
Why are you after me?

398
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:58,675
Don't peel the specs.
You're fine how you are

399
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:02,011
Tomorrow you're on the Job, correct?

400
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:05,341
6 am sharp

401
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:06,516
SiX am...?

402
00:38:07,885 --> 00:38:08,510
Morning prayers?

403
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:10,520
I'll give you a rosary.

404
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:13,189
And I'll take off my specs, go

405
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:15,191
photo...? - Glasses?

406
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,357
Say bye to Sweety. - Out

407
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:28,201
There he is!

408
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:31,871
So that's your surprise?

409
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:34,370
Grand car, no?

410
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:40,381
Get in and you're getting looks.
- Not him, the car

411
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:46,053
price? Never mind.
Only takes... a couple of Jobs

412
00:38:53,931 --> 00:38:56,900
Yes Kabir? Nice?

413
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:21,584
3000 cc Zero to hundred
In ten seconds

414
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:29,095
You should buy a car... like this

415
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:32,761
Careful

416
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:38,772
Good brakes too
Stops in 5 seconds

417
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:47,784
This is scary

418
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:55,622
Jump - What?

419
00:39:57,495 --> 00:39:57,961
Jump

420
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:19,808
What have you done?

421
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:21,814
Are you mad?

422
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:23,320
Brand new car

423
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:25,481
You're very lucky Rahul.

424
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:29,151
You could've been in that car
- What?

425
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:32,996
It's no waiter's car

426
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:38,494
We bandits got to vanish like smoke

427
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:43,670
The day cops get wind, it's all over

428
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:47,170
No one bends my rules

429
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,346
Not even I

430
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:02,684
Colour

431
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:07,030
Oh Daddy I got a trio

432
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:08,356
Thank you Mummy

433
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:10,359
I got some luck, no?

434
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:12,031
One more, one more

435
00:41:12,236 --> 00:41:13,703
We're raising stakes now.

436
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:15,368
Per head... 500

437
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:16,540
Quick

438
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:19,375
If hotshot Robin Hood finds out

439
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:24,040
he'll grill me. He puts me off

440
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,718
Tenner?

441
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:33,557
Big brother - For Band Aid

442
00:41:35,759 --> 00:41:39,217
NeXt heist is here This area

443
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:41,564
How can you be so sure Jai?

444
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,726
There's a pattern

445
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:46,729
November 20, Borivali
November 26, Kandivali

446
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:49,231
November 30, Malad
December 5, Andheri

447
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,237
December 8, Vile parle

448
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:53,569
In each of the five heists

449
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:56,905
the robbers and their bikes
vanished without a trace

450
00:41:57,948 --> 00:41:59,415
All in a trice. But how?

451
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,918
Five incidents... one common factor

452
00:42:04,788 --> 00:42:05,755
Western EXpress Highway

453
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:08,588
Always...

454
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:11,757
within a 2 or 3 minute drive
from the highway.

455
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:16,421
So I think, the neXt target... is here

456
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:18,602
Any intelligence?

457
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:21,600
On identities or
allegiances to gangs?

458
00:42:21,805 --> 00:42:23,102
This gang works for themselves.

459
00:42:23,807 --> 00:42:25,104
No past record or history

460
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:29,609
In this city... they can be
anyone, anywhere

461
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:31,607
They can only be caught in the act.

462
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:33,612
Because after the hits...

463
00:42:33,817 --> 00:42:36,285
how they masQuerade
we shall never know

464
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:38,614
How to know when neXt?

465
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:40,289
Soon enough, sir.

466
00:42:40,824 --> 00:42:42,792
Five hits in 20 days

467
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:47,787
They're revving up for a finale
before they go eXtinct

468
00:42:48,165 --> 00:42:49,132
I think that's their plan

469
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:53,299
But this time,
we'll be staking it out

470
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:17,652
Shekhar come in

471
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:18,995

472
00:43:19,697 --> 00:43:22,165
Shekhar, cover my position. Copy?

00:44:19,423 --> 00:44:22,221

00:44:22,426 --> 00:44:26,556
Okay, for whom? - Now you're asking
For my wife to-be.

478
00:44:26,764 --> 00:44:28,231
I got to be a family wallah

479
00:44:28,432 --> 00:44:31,401
No Joking on duty. If the boss gets
to see, we'll have a problem

480
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:33,069
Who's scared of your boss?

481
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:34,737
Mind your business. Sell me a bouQuet

482
00:44:34,938 --> 00:44:38,897
Make do with this rose.
- One rose for 10?

483
00:44:42,613 --> 00:44:43,409
Just...

484
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:47,910
Shekhar, you take a break.

485
00:44:48,118 --> 00:44:49,585
Get back at siX tomorrow
- Okay sir

486
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:55,425
Me too

487
00:45:02,299 --> 00:45:04,927
Home. Sweety has cooked chicken

488
00:45:08,138 --> 00:45:11,869
Until we've caught them
you aren't going anywhere, got it?

489
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:14,937
We stay rooted even if
they don't turn up for a week?

490
00:45:15,145 --> 00:45:16,942
You are too busy?

491
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:18,941
Want to inaugurate a Jail?

492
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:21,114
But Sweety's chicken...

493
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:25,451
Never heard of contact lenses?

494
00:45:30,327 --> 00:45:31,624
I'll eat on time

495
00:45:35,165 --> 00:45:36,154
Okay. Bye

496
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:39,295
Sweety, I'm working

497
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:41,971
Okay

498
00:45:43,674 --> 00:45:45,471
Yes I love you too. Bye

499
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:52,982
What?

500
00:45:56,186 --> 00:45:57,312
Go on

501
00:45:58,355 --> 00:46:01,654
First, promise - What?

502
00:46:02,693 --> 00:46:05,321
Not to hit me - No

503
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:12,498
What no? You won't hit me
or you won't promise me?

504
00:46:13,203 --> 00:46:14,830
Can't promise I won't hit you

505
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:18,504
Then I'm not telling

506
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:26,379
Okay, you can tell me

507
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:34,854
You ought to know,
Sweety would've married me, - What?

508
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,188
That's if I had met her before
...but it's okay

509
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:42,365
She was more ravishing then or now?

510
00:46:44,568 --> 00:46:46,365
You want a bashing now or later?

511
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:49,535
Must've been arranged marriage

512
00:46:50,741 --> 00:46:54,700
It was arranged for you, yes? Admit it

513
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:57,376
Hello sweety

514
00:46:58,749 --> 00:47:00,717
There's an envelope on the table

515
00:47:01,752 --> 00:47:05,051
My photos inside it?
No please, Sweety mustn't see

516
00:47:05,255 --> 00:47:07,553
It's there?

517
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:11,390
Big brother... My reputation

518
00:47:11,929 --> 00:47:14,557
She won't see my face
- Who?

519
00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:17,730
Sweety... your wife
What else?

520
00:47:19,937 --> 00:47:24,397
Keep it in my study, thanks, Bye

521
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:27,910
Yes I love you too

522
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:37,079
Don't cry for me, Mummy.

523
00:47:38,455 --> 00:47:43,256
His heart has turned to stone
- Will you shut up?

524
00:48:36,346 --> 00:48:38,644
Sit tight - What?

525
00:48:39,316 --> 00:48:46,154
I mean... public public distress.
And sleeping police?

526
00:48:46,523 --> 00:48:47,649
This is catastrophe

527
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:50,159
public help! It's a police slogan.

528
00:48:50,527 --> 00:48:52,324
You're making her helpless

529
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:55,327
Some guy, by God

530
00:48:55,532 --> 00:48:58,160
Okay you sit tight.
Let me help

531
00:48:59,036 --> 00:49:00,833
I'm a mechanic. It's my religion

532
00:49:01,371 --> 00:49:03,339
Starting up stalled cars
...is religion

533
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:04,336
EXcuse me

534
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:11,010
My car is broken down,
Could you... help please...

535
00:50:08,271 --> 00:50:21,082
Sweetheart You're mine
I'm yours

536
00:50:22,285 --> 00:50:25,413
With you lovingly
Making my family

537
00:50:25,622 --> 00:50:27,749
My heart's wish, only

538
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:29,425
Started it all over again.

539
00:50:49,312 --> 00:50:50,939
Forget. Not happening for you

540
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:04,050
Yes you only you

541
00:51:04,261 --> 00:51:06,126
I'm yours

542
00:51:12,502 --> 00:51:13,469
Incorrigible

543
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:16,798
No family I'm lonely

544
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:20,835
My home's lovely; heart's lonely

545
00:51:28,051 --> 00:51:30,986
I'm lonely; no family

546
00:51:31,388 --> 00:51:34,653
My home's lovely; my heart's lonely

547
00:51:34,858 --> 00:51:37,656
My dreams... so far they seem...

548
00:51:38,361 --> 00:51:41,330
in a life, without wife

549
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:43,496
You're lonely
even I'm lonely

550
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:48,660
You're lively, So hopefully...
you and I... make a family

551
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:29,378
If I step out...
I think you're silly

552
00:52:29,913 --> 00:52:33,542
But your lies are lovely

553
00:52:40,524 --> 00:52:43,550
You're silly

554
00:52:44,027 --> 00:52:47,053
But you pack your lies lovely

555
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:54,067
Still how can I fall for you?
I still don't know you

556
00:52:54,771 --> 00:53:00,403
Wait for another day
I'll decide what to say

557
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:01,235
Fast girl

558
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:39,448
Gone. Back to work

559
00:53:45,989 --> 00:53:48,287
Yes sir, hello sir

560
00:53:49,492 --> 00:53:51,289
Over here. - No pranks

561
00:53:51,828 --> 00:53:53,295
You'll do one turn for me. - Which?

562
00:53:53,997 --> 00:53:58,297
I got to find this sweetheart.
- You need addresses, photos

563
00:53:58,501 --> 00:54:00,469
Given all that, even I can find her.

564
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:02,638
You police guys are hopeless, really

565
00:54:03,673 --> 00:54:04,298
I warn you

566
00:54:04,507 --> 00:54:09,467
Take the left gate.
Post me every 5 minutes

567
00:54:15,185 --> 00:54:16,982
One Question, sir

568
00:54:18,355 --> 00:54:21,153
I got to improve my general knowledge

569
00:54:22,025 --> 00:54:23,993
and you're what a walking law school

570
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:26,654
Shut up

571
00:54:27,197 --> 00:54:28,323
No, shut up

572
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:31,167
Keep shut, do the Job

573
00:54:36,373 --> 00:54:39,001
Bikes. Coming

574
00:54:42,712 --> 00:54:44,680
Not coming...
moving away from us

575
00:57:00,316 --> 00:57:02,614
Go. Get them
Don't let them escape

576
00:57:07,857 --> 00:57:10,587
At 260...
I'm doing full throttle

577
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:12,157
He's over 300

578
00:57:23,706 --> 00:57:24,673
Serve table 12

579
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:26,834
Must do something about him

580
00:57:28,378 --> 00:57:29,003
Not here

581
00:57:30,046 --> 00:57:31,172
Rohit is my brother.

582
00:57:31,881 --> 00:57:32,848
He could've died

583
00:57:33,383 --> 00:57:34,680
I said, not here.

584
00:57:35,385 --> 00:57:38,354
Fetch the order for table 12
- Damn table 12

585
00:57:38,721 --> 00:57:40,348
I'm not sparing that cop

586
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,187
I'll do what's to be done.

587
00:57:45,728 --> 00:57:47,696
You don't taX your brains

588
00:57:52,902 --> 00:57:54,870
Good evening sir. - Good evening.
Table for 2 please.

589
00:58:00,743 --> 00:58:02,870
Rohit, upstairs

590
00:58:07,417 --> 00:58:12,218
Fighting the spurt in crime...
is supercop Jai DiXit

591
00:58:12,422 --> 00:58:15,050
You're on TV

592
00:58:15,592 --> 00:58:18,390
You solved your cases
in record time

593
00:58:18,595 --> 00:58:21,393
EXcept this bike gang
What's taking you so long?

594
00:58:21,931 --> 00:58:23,558
You've seen rats stealing?

595
00:58:24,601 --> 00:58:27,399
He grabs a steal...
and runs for his hole.

596
00:58:27,937 --> 00:58:30,064
That's how this bike gang is
...like rats

597
00:58:31,107 --> 00:58:33,405
They wear masks
Then they vanish

598
00:58:33,943 --> 00:58:36,741
We foiled one of their operations

599
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:40,909
Hopefully... this gang
won't bother us for long

600
00:58:41,284 --> 00:58:42,751
A message for the audience?

601
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:46,577
You'll see the defeat
on their faces soon

602
00:58:47,123 --> 00:58:49,091
For the gang...
what's your message?

603
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:51,586
Maybe they're watching
TV right now - No madam

604
00:58:51,794 --> 00:58:53,091
I don't talk to criminals

605
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:56,057
Thank you sir.
- That was supercop Jai DiXit

606
00:58:56,299 --> 00:58:58,597
For rest of the news,
watch 'AaJ Tak'

607
00:59:04,307 --> 00:59:06,434
I feel... like... - Be cool

608
00:59:07,143 --> 00:59:10,943
Don't bill him. Men like him don't
drop in every day.

609
00:59:11,147 --> 00:59:13,775
Take care of him
- Yes boss

610
00:59:15,818 --> 00:59:16,944
Must take care of him

611
00:59:19,989 --> 00:59:20,956
I'll take good care of him

612
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:23,284
Well done Jai

613
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:25,954
So what if we didn't
catch the thieves,

614
00:59:26,496 --> 00:59:28,123
their loot... we retrieved

615
00:59:28,831 --> 00:59:32,289
That bike will tell us
why they're so fast

616
00:59:33,336 --> 00:59:33,961
Hold

617
00:59:34,504 --> 00:59:35,971
Dr. Ali's operation successful.

618
00:59:36,172 --> 00:59:39,471
Wonderful engineering
Main thing, nitrous oXide cylinder

619
00:59:39,676 --> 00:59:40,973
Know what it does?

620
00:59:41,177 --> 00:59:43,805
Flick of a switch...
bike becomes a rocket

621
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:45,977
Another highlight
Trigger for timer.

622
00:59:46,182 --> 00:59:48,480
What's more...
- Good, very good

623
00:59:50,186 --> 00:59:55,317
Jai, what's our neXt step?
- They've taken a beating

624
00:59:56,192 --> 00:59:57,659
It's their turn to make a move

625
00:59:57,827 --> 00:59:58,000
For you

626
00:59:59,000 --> 00:59:59,794
For you

627
01:00:02,030 --> 01:00:05,329
Didn't call for hello-hi
- Who?

628
01:00:05,701 --> 01:00:07,669
If I'm telling it all,
what're you doing?

629
01:00:08,537 --> 01:00:10,505
How will you give
grand TV interviews?

630
01:00:10,872 --> 01:00:17,505
Then you heard me.
I don't talk to criminals

631
01:00:19,381 --> 01:00:21,849
See you in Jail
- Thanks for the offer

632
01:00:23,051 --> 01:00:24,678
But I'm not destined for Jail

633
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:27,347
Got yourself one grand destiny,

634
01:00:27,556 --> 01:00:33,358
great brains too; but...
future looks somewhat shady

635
01:00:33,562 --> 01:00:34,028
Really?

636
01:00:34,563 --> 01:00:37,361
Yes. You took the pains to call me

637
01:00:37,566 --> 01:00:39,363
It's my duty to keep you warned

638
01:00:42,571 --> 01:00:43,367
I like your style

639
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:47,368
perhaps you're too confident, no?

640
01:00:49,244 --> 01:00:51,712
Tell me your address.

641
01:00:51,913 --> 01:00:55,041
I'll deliver the bike and the money
Will help your confidence too

642
01:00:55,917 --> 01:00:57,214
Say what you will

643
01:00:57,753 --> 01:00:58,879
you'll never catch me

644
01:00:59,254 --> 01:01:02,382
Don't play hero. You're a thief.

645
01:01:02,924 --> 01:01:04,221
You'll run, I'll catch you

646
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:07,729
I'll walk right through you
you won't even recognise me

647
01:01:08,597 --> 01:01:12,226
For once, show up. You won't be
worth recognising anymore

648
01:01:12,601 --> 01:01:14,728
I'll come right up to you.

649
01:01:16,104 --> 01:01:17,901
I'll even tell you about my neXt hit

650
01:01:18,774 --> 01:01:20,571
Where will you find thieves like me?

651
01:01:22,110 --> 01:01:23,907
You find thieves only in Jails.

652
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:27,248
I'll see you right there

653
01:01:27,783 --> 01:01:31,742
My neXt time, my neXt target
you'll know beforehand

654
01:01:33,121 --> 01:01:35,419
If you nab me, it's my neck

655
01:01:37,125 --> 01:01:39,593
If I escape...
- Impossible

656
01:01:40,629 --> 01:01:42,597
I love the impossible Mr. DiXit

657
01:01:43,298 --> 01:01:44,925
But one little clause

658
01:01:45,467 --> 01:01:48,925
If you fail...
you'll drop the case

659
01:01:50,972 --> 01:01:55,272
What happened? Afraid?
- Where?

660
01:03:12,053 --> 01:03:14,351
Oh, I'm sorry. - It's okay.

661
01:03:16,224 --> 01:03:16,849
Where are you headed?

662
01:03:19,060 --> 01:03:19,856
Up ahead

663
01:03:21,897 --> 01:03:25,697
I'll take you

664
01:03:25,901 --> 01:03:28,199
I'll manage. Don't waste your time.

665
01:03:29,237 --> 01:03:32,365
Helping is no waste of time. Careful

666
01:03:34,075 --> 01:03:35,872
Very few like you around nowadays

667
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:39,376
Untrue

668
01:03:41,249 --> 01:03:42,716
Not eXactly the age of good Samaritans

669
01:03:45,587 --> 01:03:49,887
No matter how rapid the evil strides

670
01:03:50,592 --> 01:03:52,219
the good is always a march ahead

671
01:05:16,845 --> 01:05:19,473
Saying something?
- But how, Kabir?

672
01:05:20,682 --> 01:05:21,979
The police will be there in force;

673
01:05:23,685 --> 01:05:26,176
politicians are coming
It's a high security zone

674
01:05:27,522 --> 01:05:29,990
Getting inside will be tough,
as for pulling it off...

675
01:05:37,365 --> 01:05:38,161
We steal

676
01:05:40,368 --> 01:05:41,335
Right in front of everyone

677
01:05:42,704 --> 01:05:44,171
And we'll make a getaway in public

678
01:05:45,373 --> 01:05:45,839
Trust me

679
01:05:47,208 --> 01:05:49,676
Bullets... can outspeed our bikes

680
01:05:50,378 --> 01:05:53,677
Not in bullets.
Speed is a shooter's spunk

681
01:06:30,885 --> 01:06:33,217
Rock

682
01:06:34,589 --> 01:06:36,716
Love Want it?

683
01:06:36,925 --> 01:06:39,052
Make. Love Do or die

684
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:41,558
Love Is liveliest

685
01:06:43,765 --> 01:06:45,892
Love. Just do it

686
01:06:46,101 --> 01:06:48,228
Love. To do or die for

687
01:06:48,436 --> 01:06:50,734
Love. Never comes again

688
01:06:53,274 --> 01:06:55,401
Love... is life

689
01:06:55,610 --> 01:07:02,072
Love is... Joy. Give in to love...
and swing

690
01:07:02,283 --> 01:07:04,376
pump the rock

691
01:07:04,586 --> 01:07:05,450
Rock

692
01:07:50,832 --> 01:07:54,461
What's in love?

693
01:07:55,336 --> 01:07:56,303
Ask someone. Who's wild

694
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:01,467
Sways you? Why?

695
01:08:01,676 --> 01:08:03,644
Makes a smile? Why?

696
01:08:04,512 --> 01:08:08,642
Ask fireflies Why

697
01:08:27,869 --> 01:08:29,837
Love's life is short

698
01:08:30,038 --> 01:08:32,165
Begin with a flirt...

699
01:08:32,373 --> 01:08:37,003
Then give in to the spell
kiss... and

700
01:08:37,212 --> 01:08:39,180
pump the rock

701
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:40,972
Rock

702
01:09:34,435 --> 01:09:38,064
Lonesome lives go unlived

703
01:09:38,940 --> 01:09:42,569
Every soul here knows

704
01:09:43,111 --> 01:09:47,411
Dear stranger, you don't know
What desires you stir in my core

705
01:09:47,715 --> 01:09:51,913
For one lively sin...
I'll ask you for more

706
01:10:11,272 --> 01:10:13,399
Make every loving moment rock

707
01:10:13,641 --> 01:10:20,547
Love's rhythm makes your heart rock
Up love's blind alley... come...

708
01:10:20,648 --> 01:10:37,293
pump the rock...

709
01:10:43,671 --> 01:10:46,765
Over? No, won't do.
I've only arrived

710
01:10:48,009 --> 01:10:49,135
Guys... what's the vote?

711
01:10:49,344 --> 01:10:51,778
Once more - Once more

712
01:12:05,486 --> 01:12:06,680
Ladies & gentlemen

713
01:12:07,422 --> 01:12:11,552
The proceeds from this show goes to the
Chief Minister's Relief Fund

714
01:12:12,093 --> 01:12:16,029
The amount is... 42,50,000.
Have a look

715
01:12:23,438 --> 01:12:25,565
The money...?
- Where is it?

716
01:14:07,542 --> 01:14:10,170
Sweetheart... Ambulance

717
01:15:07,935 --> 01:15:09,562
What happened sir?

718
01:15:11,439 --> 01:15:14,738
I saw them in pizza place. Waiters

719
01:15:17,278 --> 01:15:18,745
Are we going there?

720
01:15:20,448 --> 01:15:23,246
No use. We won't find anyone there

721
01:15:25,786 --> 01:15:28,254
How much did you sell out for?

722
01:15:28,456 --> 01:15:29,923
This sweetheart... she swooned

723
01:15:30,124 --> 01:15:33,093
How much money?
- Not my fault

724
01:15:34,295 --> 01:15:35,728
I tell you...

725
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:41,097
No discounts on courtesy

726
01:15:43,304 --> 01:15:45,431
Brother, if I let go

727
01:15:45,973 --> 01:15:47,099
you'll get a changed face

728
01:15:55,650 --> 01:15:58,278
On the bike It's your Job

729
01:15:58,819 --> 01:15:59,945
Not the girl

730
01:16:11,832 --> 01:16:13,629
Once again...
the mysterious bike gang

731
01:16:13,834 --> 01:16:16,462
has struck... sending the
city into a tizzy.

732
01:16:16,671 --> 01:16:20,630
Sources indicate that... the police were
tipped off... well in advance

733
01:16:20,841 --> 01:16:23,309
As usual they could achieve nothing

734
01:16:23,511 --> 01:16:26,639
Jai DiXit, despite all your efforts...

735
01:16:26,847 --> 01:16:28,815
the bike gang got away with it?

736
01:16:29,350 --> 01:16:30,476
Not because they're eXceptional.

737
01:16:30,685 --> 01:16:31,481
The mistake was mine

738
01:16:31,852 --> 01:16:33,149
I made a very big mistake

739
01:16:33,688 --> 01:16:34,985
Therefore on moral grounds

740
01:16:36,023 --> 01:16:37,490
I am dropping this case
And I'm resigning

741
01:16:37,692 --> 01:16:39,990
And that mechanic?
- He's no longer on the team

742
01:16:40,194 --> 01:16:43,595
Clarify I think you know
EXcuse me

743
01:16:46,434 --> 01:16:47,696
That's Jai DiXit

744
01:16:50,938 --> 01:16:51,700
Rahul

745
01:16:54,108 --> 01:16:55,166
Where are you going?

746
01:16:57,378 --> 01:17:01,178
Not a cop any longer,
so no sparing him

747
01:17:01,382 --> 01:17:05,182
Foolish. Killing him
won't bring back Rohit

748
01:17:05,886 --> 01:17:09,014
We've lots more to do.
Get on the Job

749
01:17:12,893 --> 01:17:14,019
Who does Rohit's Job?

750
01:17:15,062 --> 01:17:16,859
Without him, the neXt Job
isn't getting done

751
01:17:22,403 --> 01:17:23,870
Get ready to Quit this city.

752
01:17:25,573 --> 01:17:26,699
I'll take care of loose ends

753
01:17:37,418 --> 01:17:40,046
What's wrong with Ali Bhai?
- Very early lead

754
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:56,225
Too late... the race is on.
What are you racing for?

755
01:18:19,627 --> 01:18:20,423
Who's that?

756
01:18:22,797 --> 01:18:23,764
He's fast

757
01:19:33,033 --> 01:19:34,000
Sorry guys

758
01:19:34,535 --> 01:19:36,162
Never mind, happens.

759
01:19:36,370 --> 01:19:37,997
We've made loads out of you

760
01:19:38,205 --> 01:19:41,003
One race makes no difference.
- Still, you lost money

761
01:19:41,375 --> 01:19:43,002
Luckless day

762
01:19:43,244 --> 01:19:46,008
Scrapped with Jai; then Sweetheart
vanishes from the hospital

763
01:19:46,914 --> 01:19:49,348
Made me want to burn the track.
Here, I'm run out

764
01:19:49,550 --> 01:19:51,347
I really want to wreck
that guy in black

765
01:19:57,391 --> 01:19:58,016
What man?

766
01:19:59,059 --> 01:20:03,860
I don't take charity
- I'm not racing for money

767
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:08,027
What I'm looking for money won't buy

768
01:20:14,041 --> 01:20:15,668
Am I game? No way

769
01:20:16,377 --> 01:20:18,004
I don't fancy getting
shot by the police

770
01:20:19,413 --> 01:20:20,744
The police can't even touch you

771
01:20:21,615 --> 01:20:25,244
and you know it.
Or are you scared?

772
01:20:26,554 --> 01:20:30,854
If I could, I would drown
every cop in the sea...

773
01:20:31,225 --> 01:20:32,192
beginning with Jai;

774
01:20:32,493 --> 01:20:34,620
after pumping him so hard

775
01:20:36,897 --> 01:20:38,364
Harder than I care to tell you

776
01:20:40,234 --> 01:20:41,201
Then why hesitate?

777
01:20:44,104 --> 01:20:47,369
How to find confidence in you?

778
01:20:47,575 --> 01:20:48,701
You can be a cop

779
01:21:00,354 --> 01:21:02,219
Not a copper has set sight
on this face.

780
01:21:03,524 --> 01:21:04,718
Never will you might not think so

781
01:21:06,861 --> 01:21:10,388
but I know you're worth millions

782
01:21:12,199 --> 01:21:13,496
Don't waste your life, Ali

783
01:21:15,936 --> 01:21:18,496
If I tell the cops that
I've seen you

784
01:21:19,540 --> 01:21:21,337
I'm up for the reward

785
01:21:23,410 --> 01:21:26,345
I think you already got a reward
for working with the police

786
01:21:27,948 --> 01:21:30,178
I'm sure you aren't going
anywhere near them

787
01:21:30,951 --> 01:21:32,350


788
01:21:32,553 --> 01:21:34,180
At the crossroads

789
01:21:34,955 --> 01:21:36,013
See you

790
01:21:38,559 --> 01:21:40,527
I'm not an early riser

791
01:21:40,728 --> 01:21:44,858
Your luck is changing
You'll change

792
01:22:25,773 --> 01:22:30,073
Mummy was always telling me Ali,
you're smart and you're fast

793
01:22:30,611 --> 01:22:32,909
You want to be smart and fast? - Sure

794
01:22:33,113 --> 01:22:33,579
Just open up

795
01:22:36,283 --> 01:22:36,908
Now close it

796
01:22:37,618 --> 01:22:38,414
Tony Bhai

797
01:22:39,453 --> 01:22:40,920
Ali, something's odd about my bike.

798
01:22:41,121 --> 01:22:41,917
What? - The firing.

799
01:22:42,456 --> 01:22:44,754
I'll change my name
if I can't fiX it

800
01:22:45,426 --> 01:22:52,923
What will you name yourself? Rohit?
- Mummy gave me a great name

801
01:22:53,133 --> 01:22:55,931
So why change it. Sorry Tony,
no changing names. Rahul is right

802
01:22:56,637 --> 01:22:59,265
Rahul Bhai, you can tell me
whenever your bike sneezes

803
01:22:59,473 --> 01:23:00,269
Don't touch it

804
01:23:01,475 --> 01:23:04,273
You'll take Rohit's place?
He's dead. Because of you.

805
01:23:04,478 --> 01:23:06,105
I'm on your side now, brother

806
01:23:06,313 --> 01:23:06,938
I'm no brother

807
01:23:08,148 --> 01:23:10,776
I fly off my handle,
you end up a sissy

808
01:23:11,151 --> 01:23:11,947
You bloody

809
01:23:12,152 --> 01:23:12,618
Boys

810
01:23:14,321 --> 01:23:15,117
Take it easy

811
01:23:19,326 --> 01:23:20,793
I don't like his face

812
01:23:21,161 --> 01:23:24,961
And I don't like your face
Nor you like mine

813
01:23:26,333 --> 01:23:31,134
We're not friends
But we need each other

814
01:23:31,672 --> 01:23:32,639
That's it

815
01:23:34,675 --> 01:23:36,302
After we're done this time,

816
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:39,312
no one will have any need left

817
01:23:40,347 --> 01:23:43,976
Neither to steal nor
to tolerate each other

818
01:23:46,086 --> 01:23:48,145
So stop the infighting

819
01:23:50,524 --> 01:23:54,654
I want all siX of us
over here at sunset

820
01:23:55,362 --> 01:23:56,659
Let's get down to some serious work

821
01:24:02,436 --> 01:24:05,166
Kabir Bhai, listen...

822
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:09,434
you're a great guy.
But one little mistake

823
01:24:10,044 --> 01:24:13,605
We're five of us, not siX.
Mannu, Tony, myself

824
01:24:14,148 --> 01:24:18,278
Mr Boom-bastic and you. Five.
- Not five. SiX

825
01:24:19,053 --> 01:24:21,283
Start counting
Mannu, Tony, myself...

826
01:24:21,488 --> 01:24:22,477
Look

827
01:25:27,721 --> 01:25:29,018
Thank you, Mummy

828
01:25:34,394 --> 01:25:37,192
Topclass acting.

829
01:25:37,564 --> 01:25:40,533
Dance, romance, works
I sent you on an ambulance ride

830
01:25:40,734 --> 01:25:43,362
And I find you riding waves

831
01:25:43,570 --> 01:25:44,195
Wonderful sweetheart

832
01:25:48,208 --> 01:25:49,004
My name is Sheena

833
01:25:49,743 --> 01:25:53,372
And whatever I did with you
was part of my Job

834
01:25:54,414 --> 01:25:57,383
My Job. So you and me...

835
01:25:58,485 --> 01:25:59,383
Never think of it

836
01:26:04,158 --> 01:26:05,386
What Mummy...

837
01:26:05,592 --> 01:26:07,059
you send me one girl
and she's a hood

838
01:26:08,996 --> 01:26:10,861
Too many hassles in life

839
01:26:12,099 --> 01:26:15,398
TaJ EXotica. Largest,
grandest hotel in Goa

840
01:26:16,937 --> 01:26:18,564
Yes lovely hotel

841
01:26:19,740 --> 01:26:22,072
But we're thieves, not tourists

842
01:26:23,777 --> 01:26:24,903
What the hell are we doing here?

843
01:26:29,516 --> 01:26:31,575
Look at it through a thiefs eyes...

844
01:26:33,453 --> 01:26:35,921
and you'll see 180 million bucks

845
01:26:41,295 --> 01:26:42,922
India's biggest casino

846
01:26:45,632 --> 01:26:49,432
Fortunes are made
everyday and... lost

847
01:26:53,140 --> 01:26:54,607
Whatever a gambler's luck...

848
01:26:55,409 --> 01:26:57,172
the casino is always...
on a winning spree

849
01:27:00,647 --> 01:27:04,447
Last year, December 31...
raked in... 16 crores

850
01:27:04,985 --> 01:27:06,782
Takings Trucked away

851
01:27:06,987 --> 01:27:12,425
To a special vault once every
hour under tight security

852
01:27:13,660 --> 01:27:15,594
They are so confident
about the security system

853
01:27:16,163 --> 01:27:17,926
No video cameras are installed

854
01:27:22,836 --> 01:27:24,827
This year on December 31
the management eXpects...

855
01:27:25,005 --> 01:27:27,439
the casino will rake in

856
01:27:37,684 --> 01:27:38,651


857
01:27:41,054 --> 01:27:42,146
SiX thieves

858
01:27:44,458 --> 01:27:45,482
Split evenly

859
01:27:45,692 --> 01:27:47,626
How much for the two of us
put together, sweetheart?

860
01:27:48,629 --> 01:27:50,995
I'm bad at arithmetic

861
01:27:53,533 --> 01:27:57,993
It's our final hit
Afterwards, we're free

862
01:27:59,339 --> 01:28:01,330
We will never see one another again

863
01:28:01,975 --> 01:28:04,466
nor will we try to contact each other

864
01:28:05,212 --> 01:28:09,012
Nice idea. But it's a hotel, not a bank.

865
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:10,683
Teeming with people. So more risk

866
01:28:10,884 --> 01:28:15,844
Mannu says that the security system
was designed by an Israeli company

867
01:28:16,290 --> 01:28:20,192
Opening the safe won't be easy.
- Infrared alarm at main door

868
01:28:21,295 --> 01:28:24,355
Goa police will be after
us in 30 seconds

869
01:28:24,731 --> 01:28:27,029
Kabir must've worked all that out

870
01:28:27,567 --> 01:28:31,367
What I want to know is
How we go about it.

871
01:28:32,306 --> 01:28:34,035
I'll second that Question

872
01:28:37,244 --> 01:28:41,044
Whatever we do...
we do in style

873
01:28:49,923 --> 01:28:50,890
Four-stroke Joint

874
01:29:00,434 --> 01:29:02,902
We got reservations - Name?

875
01:29:03,103 --> 01:29:06,231
Prince Ali Akbar Fateh Khan
of Secunderabad

876
01:29:06,473 --> 01:29:07,735
Of course

877
01:29:07,941 --> 01:29:09,408
Suite 101?

878
01:29:15,682 --> 01:29:17,081
Hi Austin... Austin powers.

879
01:29:17,284 --> 01:29:18,080
You lodged a complaint?

880
01:29:18,618 --> 01:29:22,577
There's a virus in the system.
- I'm here to fiX it

881
01:29:22,789 --> 01:29:23,414
This way, please

882
01:29:29,763 --> 01:29:31,697
We offer a choice of suites

883
01:29:32,366 --> 01:29:37,770
Any reason for your choice?
- We're honeymooning

884
01:29:37,971 --> 01:29:42,601
Royal astrologer says, book into room

885
01:29:51,518 --> 01:29:53,611
Listen... I want my money back. - What?

886
01:29:54,321 --> 01:29:56,289
It's my money.
- It's Kabir's money

887
01:29:56,823 --> 01:29:59,291
Then give me a loan

888
01:29:59,493 --> 01:30:05,125
Why on earth did Kabir take him on?
- Because he knows you love me secretly

889
01:30:06,833 --> 01:30:09,563
Keep that gibberish here.

890
01:30:09,870 --> 01:30:12,134
Downstairs, remember you're a prince

891
01:30:15,342 --> 01:30:16,969
EXhausted your English vocabulary?

892
01:30:17,177 --> 01:30:18,644
Should've saved some for tonight

893
01:30:18,879 --> 01:30:19,641
Hello Room Service

894
01:30:20,347 --> 01:30:22,645
- Got it

895
01:30:26,219 --> 01:30:27,811
Good you're here

896
01:30:28,021 --> 01:30:30,148
Taking charge of the bar?
What's your name?

897
01:30:41,368 --> 01:30:42,665
You play like a seasoned gambler.

898
01:30:42,869 --> 01:30:44,837
If you're so good who needs thieving?

899
01:30:45,372 --> 01:30:47,670
Ali, you're a prince. Don't forget

900
01:30:48,442 --> 01:30:50,171
Sweetheart, no yakking.

901
01:30:50,377 --> 01:30:51,503
Daddy is eavesdropping

902
01:30:52,712 --> 01:30:55,510
Good evening. Everything okay?
- Yes yes. Thank you. Very okay

903
01:30:56,450 --> 01:31:00,682
One problem. We're leaving tonight.
- At 13 past 12

904
01:31:01,054 --> 01:31:03,522
Have we caused anything?
- No, not yet

905
01:31:03,723 --> 01:31:07,022
Royal astrologer called
and Daddy insists. So...

906
01:31:07,227 --> 01:31:09,354
got to go.
- We're back neXt week

907
01:31:09,729 --> 01:31:10,696
Wonderful

908
01:31:11,231 --> 01:31:12,198
Our luggage is packed.

909
01:31:12,399 --> 01:31:14,367
Please have it put in the car
- Don't worry my dear

910
01:31:15,569 --> 01:31:17,867
Your luggage will be in your car
at Quarter past twelve

911
01:31:22,242 --> 01:31:23,869
By then we've robbed the place

912
01:31:24,478 --> 01:31:27,208
I told you. Never use the word

913
01:31:28,081 --> 01:31:29,878
Who have we to fear?

914
01:31:30,750 --> 01:31:32,047
No cops around

915
01:31:34,821 --> 01:31:36,049
One whisky please

916
01:31:45,599 --> 01:31:46,224
What are you drinking?

917
01:31:50,103 --> 01:31:51,400
Forgot

918
01:31:53,974 --> 01:31:56,408
Anything will do
Make it Quick

919
01:31:56,610 --> 01:31:59,909
Else, my wife will find out

920
01:32:07,787 --> 01:32:10,085
Will you have a drink?
- No thanks

921
01:32:10,290 --> 01:32:11,257
I don't drink

922
01:32:11,525 --> 01:32:14,585
What? Really?

923
01:32:16,296 --> 01:32:23,759
You... a bartender
who doesn't drink? How?

924
01:32:25,071 --> 01:32:28,097
With... all the booze around

925
01:32:28,308 --> 01:32:29,775
Very bad

926
01:32:30,143 --> 01:32:33,271
All around, money's flying too.
But I never steal

927
01:32:34,314 --> 01:32:38,546
Very good

928
01:32:42,822 --> 01:32:45,950
You know...
I used to be a cop

929
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:48,793
Was

930
01:32:51,665 --> 01:32:52,791
Never tell anyone.

931
01:32:53,767 --> 01:32:55,132
They'll run scared

932
01:32:55,368 --> 01:33:00,965
I won't tell anyone that you've had
a drink and you're a police officer

933
01:33:02,342 --> 01:33:06,972
Was - Okay. Was

934
01:33:10,517 --> 01:33:10,983
Thanks buddy

935
01:33:11,184 --> 01:33:15,484
Happy New Year

936
01:33:16,022 --> 01:33:16,818
Now...?

937
01:33:19,059 --> 01:33:20,321
At midnight, no?

938
01:33:20,527 --> 01:33:21,653
In case we don't meet

939
01:33:22,529 --> 01:33:23,496
Happy New Year in advance

940
01:33:28,602 --> 01:33:32,333
No my friend
Of course we'll meet

941
01:33:33,540 --> 01:33:36,509
In Happy New Year
of course we'll meet

942
01:33:38,945 --> 01:33:39,843
I like you

943
01:33:42,749 --> 01:33:43,841
My drink

944
01:33:48,755 --> 01:33:52,691
Was... what I was

945
01:33:58,565 --> 01:34:00,192
Jai DiXit is in the hotel

946
01:34:03,637 --> 01:34:06,037
How could this happen?
Now what to do?

947
01:34:07,240 --> 01:34:08,207
I warned you

948
01:34:09,743 --> 01:34:10,869
It's serious Kabir

949
01:34:13,079 --> 01:34:13,704
Where is Ali?

950
01:34:15,649 --> 01:34:18,379
Let's get our luggage - What?

951
01:34:18,585 --> 01:34:22,214
Let's slip out Quietly

952
01:34:23,256 --> 01:34:29,217
Kabir Bhai, you start out first.
- RelaX Ali

953
01:34:29,929 --> 01:34:35,060
It's time we ran. No one knows
that psycho more than I know

954
01:34:35,268 --> 01:34:37,395
He'll crunch every bone

955
01:34:37,604 --> 01:34:38,901
Alone, he's no threat to us

956
01:34:40,674 --> 01:34:41,902
Don't underestimate him.

957
01:34:42,108 --> 01:34:43,405
He's the last samurai

958
01:34:43,610 --> 01:34:44,736
I don't give a damn

959
01:34:50,950 --> 01:34:56,911
Anyway, it's New Years Eve, the whole
world is here, maybe he's Just a guest

960
01:34:57,557 --> 01:35:02,119
So, we change plans?
- No Sheena

961
01:35:05,365 --> 01:35:07,424
I waited a whole year for tonight

962
01:35:09,135 --> 01:35:12,263
My plans. Mine

963
01:35:13,306 --> 01:35:14,102
No change

964
01:35:24,184 --> 01:35:27,950
it all by myself

965
01:35:29,155 --> 01:35:31,623
Anyone who isn't with me
isn't coming with me

966
01:36:21,207 --> 01:36:24,665
Take in this wonderful night

967
01:36:25,044 --> 01:36:28,343
It's all in this moment
it'll never come one more time

968
01:36:36,556 --> 01:36:40,185
To another night...
to another time...

969
01:36:40,393 --> 01:36:44,193
to a new tomorrow

970
01:36:44,397 --> 01:36:51,701
Cheers

971
01:38:02,809 --> 01:38:09,612
It's wild tonight...
in drunken delight

972
01:38:10,483 --> 01:38:14,112
Earth spins at our feet

973
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:17,619
We're so full of life

974
01:38:18,324 --> 01:38:25,457
You've only so long as you're
still young only so much fun

975
01:38:26,165 --> 01:38:29,965
Just a little flip

976
01:38:30,169 --> 01:38:33,138
Get a taste of the real thing

977
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:37,640
To another night,
to another time

978
01:38:37,844 --> 01:38:39,471
To a new tomorrow

979
01:38:39,679 --> 01:38:41,306
Who cares what the world thinks

980
01:39:40,406 --> 01:39:43,864
We're carefree

981
01:39:44,410 --> 01:39:47,379
Who cares where

982
01:39:48,247 --> 01:39:51,876
This trip ends

983
01:39:52,085 --> 01:39:55,213
We're wild and free

984
01:39:55,421 --> 01:39:59,721
We're free, we're different

985
01:39:59,926 --> 01:40:03,555
We can do what we want

986
01:40:03,763 --> 01:40:05,731
Whatever you hear

987
01:40:05,898 --> 01:40:07,365
Whatever they say

988
01:40:07,767 --> 01:40:10,736
Nothing's stopping us today

989
01:40:11,437 --> 01:40:15,066
To another night, to another time

990
01:40:15,274 --> 01:40:18,573
To a new tomorrow

991
01:40:19,145 --> 01:40:21,079
Cheers

992
01:41:04,157 --> 01:41:06,455
Been a pleasure having you here

993
01:41:06,659 --> 01:41:07,626
Same here

994
01:41:07,827 --> 01:41:08,623
Everything to satisfaction?

995
01:41:08,828 --> 01:41:10,295
Privacy etc?

996
01:41:10,530 --> 01:41:11,121
Yes

997
01:41:11,330 --> 01:41:12,126
Your luggage

998
01:41:19,338 --> 01:41:21,465
Congratulations boys.
We've done it

999
01:42:05,218 --> 01:42:06,185
Like I said

1000
01:42:07,053 --> 01:42:08,520
we meet in the new year

1001
01:42:11,724 --> 01:42:12,691
Happy New Year

1002
01:42:13,726 --> 01:42:16,024
Now...? - Your wish

1003
01:42:17,196 --> 01:42:22,657
You can try running, then chasing,
then blood and gore

1004
01:42:23,736 --> 01:42:26,102
Or we can depart peacefully.

1005
01:42:26,739 --> 01:42:30,038
Get in my car, then Jail sweet Jail

1006
01:42:30,743 --> 01:42:31,710
It's upto you

1007
01:42:34,914 --> 01:42:35,380
Let's walk

1008
01:42:49,562 --> 01:42:55,694
You do a good bit of acting.
- And you're good at stealing

1009
01:42:56,769 --> 01:42:59,738
But the good is one
march ahead of evil

1010
01:43:00,773 --> 01:43:01,398
You're good

1011
01:43:02,608 --> 01:43:05,907
Were you a thief, we'd be friends

1012
01:43:11,284 --> 01:43:14,082
Kabir you break my heart

1013
01:43:14,620 --> 01:43:16,747
I thought we're friends enough

1014
01:43:17,123 --> 01:43:19,091
for you to write me letters from Jail

1015
01:43:20,793 --> 01:43:21,919
Between friends...

1016
01:43:23,596 --> 01:43:24,563
you got me

1017
01:43:25,464 --> 01:43:26,590
but what about the loot?

1018
01:43:27,300 --> 01:43:28,597
You don't have the money

1019
01:43:32,638 --> 01:43:33,104
I do

1020
01:43:36,642 --> 01:43:42,444
Right now Ali is
delivering the cash, nice?

1021
01:43:47,119 --> 01:43:50,577
You're wasting your time
with the police

1022
01:43:52,158 --> 01:43:52,624
You're very good

1023
01:43:54,160 --> 01:43:58,790
Ali was with you.
You planted him

1024
01:43:59,832 --> 01:44:00,958
Don't blame me.

1025
01:44:02,168 --> 01:44:03,430
You took him on

1026
01:44:07,506 --> 01:44:11,806
That fight was a sham?

1027
01:44:13,512 --> 01:44:17,972
He took real blows.
Sorry if that hurts you

1028
01:44:24,023 --> 01:44:30,826
After Rohit, I'd go to Ali looking
for another rider. You knew it?

1029
01:44:31,597 --> 01:44:33,189
No. I hoped

1030
01:44:35,868 --> 01:44:36,835
Mind blowing

1031
01:44:37,536 --> 01:44:39,333
Ali and you

1032
01:44:40,539 --> 01:44:41,506
You got me man

1033
01:44:43,609 --> 01:44:46,840
It was a perfect plan - Not was

1034
01:44:49,215 --> 01:44:50,341
It is a perfect plan

1035
01:44:51,884 --> 01:44:53,010
One thing Jai

1036
01:44:56,555 --> 01:45:02,187
Nothing is permanent
Not you, not I

1037
01:45:03,362 --> 01:45:07,526
Neither plan, Nor time

1038
01:45:17,076 --> 01:45:18,043
See?

1039
01:45:18,311 --> 01:45:19,710
Time changes

1040
01:45:23,749 --> 01:45:24,716
What happened to the lights?

1041
01:45:24,917 --> 01:45:26,214
Check the lights

1042
01:45:33,959 --> 01:45:35,392
Run Kabir

1043
01:45:37,263 --> 01:45:38,230
Run for your life

1044
01:45:52,812 --> 01:45:54,074
True sweetheart

1045
01:45:55,781 --> 01:45:57,248
There's lots of money in crime.

1046
01:45:58,451 --> 01:45:59,748
But respectability? Not a shred

1047
01:46:04,623 --> 01:46:07,922
Kabir won't spare you
- Kabir has become mincemeat

1048
01:46:08,127 --> 01:46:11,927
You know Jai?
One danger-full guy

1049
01:46:15,634 --> 01:46:17,761
For a 3000 buck Job...?
- Please sweetheart

1050
01:46:17,970 --> 01:46:19,437
Not Just for the money.

1051
01:46:19,638 --> 01:46:21,105
The starched uniform is a perk

1052
01:46:22,641 --> 01:46:25,940
After being with Jai, I admit.
It's a respectable Job

1053
01:46:26,712 --> 01:46:30,273
Once we're mister-missus...
you will...

1054
01:46:30,483 --> 01:46:31,780
say it with pride.
My husband, police

1055
01:46:33,652 --> 01:46:35,779
Just say you love me
before you run for it

1056
01:46:36,989 --> 01:46:38,456
I'm not running

1057
01:46:38,657 --> 01:46:43,617
Even if I run
I won't come back to you

1058
01:46:44,830 --> 01:46:49,130
Guarantee! Our marriage certificate
was stamped up above. You will come

1059
01:46:49,502 --> 01:46:52,300
Mummy has even thought up names
for our kids. Want to hear?

1060
01:46:54,006 --> 01:46:56,634
Sweetheart, here comes
their Uncle Jai

1061
01:47:13,359 --> 01:47:15,327
Kabir bhai, happy new year

1062
01:47:16,429 --> 01:47:21,332
You took long
I was Just telling Sheena

1063
01:47:22,034 --> 01:47:24,002
You're late. She went off to sleep

1064
01:47:24,203 --> 01:47:25,170
Bored

1065
01:47:28,707 --> 01:47:29,503
What...?

1066
01:47:29,875 --> 01:47:32,844
Everyone warned me.
I never heeded

1067
01:47:47,793 --> 01:47:50,023
First ever time I failed
to make out a man

1068
01:48:03,909 --> 01:48:08,710
Sheena, I guess you hate him the most

1069
01:48:28,100 --> 01:48:34,562
Sweetheart. You'll kill me?

1070
01:48:59,298 --> 01:49:02,597
Not here. Let's move out.

1071
01:49:03,636 --> 01:49:05,763
Come on Sheena
Come on let's go

1072
01:49:05,971 --> 01:49:07,438
She isn't coming

1073
01:49:16,282 --> 01:49:24,314
Sweetheart... they're gone
You didn't

1074
01:49:37,169 --> 01:49:39,797
Now I'm relaXed

1075
01:49:43,275 --> 01:49:46,972
Move Ali - Now...?

1076
01:49:47,212 --> 01:49:50,181
No I'm staying here

1077
01:49:53,485 --> 01:49:54,782
Crazy

1078
01:49:57,856 --> 01:50:04,318
I'll be back
Sweetheart, don't vanish again

1079
01:50:25,217 --> 01:50:27,685
Yes yes. Thank you

1080
01:50:28,554 --> 01:50:30,021
Very okay very okay

1081
01:50:31,557 --> 01:50:32,854
Your timing's all out.

1082
01:50:33,092 --> 01:50:35,185
First time in life...
I start on a love scene.

1083
01:50:35,394 --> 01:50:36,361
And you get shooting

1084
01:50:36,562 --> 01:50:39,030
I could've been shot.
- Were you?

1085
01:50:39,231 --> 01:50:42,200
Where we you when he was
grinding me at gunpoint?

1086
01:50:43,902 --> 01:50:47,360
Didn't I save you?
- My good luck. Mummy's blessings

1087
01:50:47,573 --> 01:50:48,369
Thank you Mummy

1088
01:50:48,907 --> 01:50:50,534
You didn't take the bullet.
- If I did...

1089
01:50:51,076 --> 01:50:52,373
I'd end up in a police station.

1090
01:50:52,578 --> 01:50:54,205
Martyr in a photo frame

1091
01:50:54,413 --> 01:50:59,043
police station?
- Yes... I'm a cop no?

1092
01:51:00,252 --> 01:51:03,380
Until we've caught them,
you're only Ali. Get it?

1093
01:51:04,590 --> 01:51:08,048
So I get to die for free?
- Are you dead and gone?

1094
01:51:08,260 --> 01:51:10,387
But I'm going. I resign.

1095
01:51:10,596 --> 01:51:12,063
No life guarantee, so I resign

1096
01:51:12,765 --> 01:51:13,561
You swim?

1097
01:51:16,268 --> 01:51:18,236
I'll resign when I touch base.

1098
01:51:18,771 --> 01:51:22,229
Take me ashore. - There

1099
01:52:17,329 --> 01:52:18,796
What are you trying? Why?

1100
01:53:03,542 --> 01:53:04,338
Hold on

1101
01:53:12,050 --> 01:53:13,176
Buck up

1102
01:53:22,094 --> 01:53:24,688
Boating on streets
Needs a driving lesson

1103
01:53:42,748 --> 01:53:43,544
fast

1104
01:53:49,221 --> 01:53:49,949
Faster

1105
01:53:50,155 --> 01:53:52,123
Jai overdrive. Overtake him

1106
01:54:26,291 --> 01:54:27,087
Drive

1107
01:55:29,855 --> 01:55:30,480
Come on

1108
01:56:48,934 --> 01:56:49,798
Bye Boom-bastic

1109
01:57:19,464 --> 01:57:20,761
Hi. Big Brother

1110
01:57:20,966 --> 01:57:21,591
All fine?

1111
01:57:22,134 --> 01:57:23,601
You're blocking my view

1112
01:57:23,802 --> 01:57:28,102
Why aren't you stopping? Stop

1113
01:57:28,306 --> 01:57:30,103
Mistake. Sorry

1114
01:57:31,476 --> 01:57:32,602
Sorry Jai

1115
01:57:32,978 --> 01:57:33,444
Idiot

1116
01:57:33,645 --> 01:57:35,442
Driving this mac was fun. So...

1117
01:57:35,647 --> 01:57:37,114
You can't see? - No...

1118
01:57:37,315 --> 01:57:38,111
I was dangling...

1119
01:58:50,122 --> 01:58:52,682
Like I said... you're thief

1120
01:58:52,891 --> 01:58:54,859
You run. I get you

1121
01:58:55,060 --> 01:58:56,357
Like I said...

1122
01:58:57,229 --> 01:59:01,359
I'll walk right through you
You'll never catch me

1123
01:59:52,184 --> 01:59:53,583
What a waste of life

1124
01:59:55,420 --> 01:59:59,880
If you weren't a thief
we would've been friends

1125
02:00:06,464 --> 02:00:08,762
Now I'm a policeman?

1126
02:00:08,967 --> 02:00:13,768
We'll see - Means what man?

1127
02:00:14,806 --> 02:00:17,434
I ought to get a chance
to become a decent guy

1128
02:00:17,542 --> 02:00:18,440
Like I said, we'll see

1129
02:00:19,044 --> 02:00:21,911
Sub Inspector or Inspector?
Who's higher up?

1130
02:00:22,614 --> 02:00:23,581
You'll find out

1131
02:00:24,216 --> 02:00:28,414
Okay don't send Sheena to Jail.
- Why? She isn't a thief?

1132
02:00:28,787 --> 02:00:32,723
But she's marrying a policeman.
She deserves a discount?

1133
02:00:33,325 --> 02:00:38,786
A reservation in ladies' Jail.
- Only if I'm posted there

1134
02:00:39,364 --> 02:00:40,797
Yes...? - Shut up
