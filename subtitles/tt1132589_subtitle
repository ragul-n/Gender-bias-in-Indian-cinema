1
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,901
What if they attack
the police convoy...

2
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,564
...and try to release Rashid?

3
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,834
So they will get nothing.

4
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:18,969
Sir, the commissioner is not
sending Rashid with the convoy.

5
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:20,034
That's just a decoy.

6
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:23,571
And Rashid?

7
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:51,730
Sir, everyone is here.
They are waiting for you.

8
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:54,062
The chiefs of all the three
services and the police as well.

9
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:55,794
What about Kumar? Has he come?
- Yes, sir.

10
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:57,096
He's waiting for you upstairs.
- Yes.

11
00:03:58,738 --> 00:03:59,727
Thank you.

12
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:01,667
Yes, please sit down.
Please sit down.

13
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:07,568
Good morning, everybody.

14
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:11,015
And allow me to introduce
to you, Mr. Rajesh Kumar...

15
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,280
...who is from our
counter terrorist unit.

16
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:17,551
And he is handling
Rashid Omar's case.

17
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,021
Mr. Rajesh Kumar, please begin.
- Sir.

18
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:28,091
Gentlemen, Rashid Omar,
the mastermind...

19
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:31,034
...of an
international terrorist group...

20
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:35,034
They tried to get him released
today morning but were unsuccessful...

21
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,306
The leader of this group
is someone called Abdullah.

22
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:42,704
We don't have much
information about him.

23
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:48,116
But this man, Rashid,
is the brain behind...

24
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:52,453
...many of the terrorist
activities across the world.

25
00:04:54,294 --> 00:05:01,791
London, 300 people
killed; Paris, suicide bombing.

26
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:08,072
Bali, attack on the consonant.

27
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:12,071
Really, the list is endless.

28
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:16,738
Should we encounter him,
if you agree? - No.

29
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:19,251
It's very important
to keep him alive.

30
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,147
Through him, we have
to find out what their...

31
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:25,748
...future plans are, so
that we can fail them.

32
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:31,152
In prison, whenever he is
asked why he does all this...

33
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:37,100
...what he wants, he
has just one answer.

34
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:39,827
Watch this.

35
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:49,180
Abdullah will tell you
everything at proper time!

36
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:57,179
For now, get this very
clear that one day...

37
00:05:57,256 --> 00:06:00,783
...we'll rule the entire universe!

38
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:06,191
Today we have decided
that we'll take him...

39
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:08,699
...to the
Narco-analysis cell in Bangalore...

40
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:12,202
...where he'll be given the
drug to tell the truth...

41
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:14,205
...and his brain will be mapped too...

42
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:16,571
...with which we'll get
to know all their secrets.

43
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,734
What's the problem then?

44
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:22,144
Sir, the problem is that this
will be done three days from now.

45
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:25,483
And till then, these people
will surely attempt something.

46
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,211
After looking at the
courage of today's attempt...

47
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:31,848
...it clearly shows that
they don't lack funds, sir.

48
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:35,589
And these people can do anything
in order to get Rashid released...

49
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:40,294
In fact, their next attempt
could be even more dangerous, sir...

50
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,266
And, maybe successful too.

51
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:07,351
"Wonder who's in control.
What's going on?"

52
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:15,724
"You can't see the future,
so keep walking."

53
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:22,264
"Hijack.
- See your world is burning."

54
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:26,277
"Hijack.
- Feels like hopes are burning."

55
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:30,281
"Hijack.
- Now your time is ticking."

56
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:34,285
"Hijack.
- Are you feeling lonely?"

57
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:38,289
"Hijack.
- The traveller doesn't know."

58
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:41,383
"Hijack.
- What's going on?"

59
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:46,288
"Hijack.
- We're the travellers."

60
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:49,459
"Hijack.
- What's going on?"

61
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,325
"Hijack. Hijack."

62
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:25,597
Hey, where are you going?
- Where will I go?

63
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:27,767
I've been looking for
this Vicky since morning.

64
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,866
I just saw the engineer
going towards the remote apron.

65
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:33,002
He must be with his stupid plane!

66
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:34,410
I am at the remote apron.

67
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,338
Tell me on my behalf that
that plane has not moved...

68
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:38,610
...even by an inch in
the last 10 years!

69
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:42,084
Are you coming to the party?
Get a nice gift for me!

70
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:44,281
I'll get it, you fatso! Okay, bye!

71
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,459
Vicky! Vicky!
- Here!

72
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,023
Why are you always lying here?

73
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:56,667
I'm telling you, this plane
is useless. It's a dead plane.

74
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,398
You have to die in order to
acquire heaven. What say, fatso?

75
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:04,534
Heaven.

76
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,668
You wait and watch.

77
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:07,303
One day I'm going to
make this plane fly.

78
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,447
Pass me the wrench.
- Wrench.

79
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,374
I am the security chief over here...

80
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:13,611
...and you're making me a mechanic?

81
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:15,843
Here.

82
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:18,385
What's this?
- Invitation card.

83
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:19,981
Are you getting married again?
- Are you mad?

84
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,054
I'll have to die for that.
- Why?

85
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,393
You just said that if you
want to acquire heaven...

86
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:25,725
...you'll have to die.

87
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:28,865
Why are you spoiling
your wedding anniversary...

88
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:29,993
...by inviting me?

89
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,967
I knew. I knew you'd say this.

90
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:38,136
But Neena! Women think
they're always right.

91
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,609
She sent me with the card.

92
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,408
Okay, listen, how
many years has it been...

93
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,742
...since you got married?

94
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:47,718
9.
- 9 years. That's why.

95
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,350
Are you going towards the hangar?
- Yes.

96
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:52,615
Then go.
- Hey you!

97
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,820
Okay, listen, you have
to come to the party.

98
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:56,418
Be ready, I'll come to pick you up.

99
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:59,093
Okay? No excuses! Bye!
- See you!

100
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,436
Come on, hit him!

101
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:21,112
Yes, very good! Come on, hit him!

102
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:25,715
Come on! Yes! Push him!
Come on! Good!

103
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:33,388
Come on! Yes! Come on! Throw him!

104
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,878
Hurry up! Hurry up!

105
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,205
Hey, come on! Faster! Faster!

106
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:52,750
Move ahead! Very good!

107
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,616
Move ahead! Move ahead!
- Beat him!

108
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:16,498
Greetings.
- Greetings.

109
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:18,236
Is everything alright?
- Yes, sir. Everything is alright.

110
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,436
Anything else?

111
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,545
Yes. Yes.

112
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,748
Greetings.
- Greetings.

113
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:45,096
Hello. Yes. Yes, yes. Yes.

114
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:51,131
Alright.

115
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,883
What's the matter? Why are you
so tense? Is everything fine?

116
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:09,660
It's Abdullah's order to
activate mission 'Parinda'.

117
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:11,186
And we have just 3 days.

118
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:15,563
But sir, just three days?
- I know, the work is difficult...

119
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:18,501
...and we have very less time.

120
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:20,866
But we'll have to do it, right?

121
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,038
Sir, we've already lost Faizal,
Irfan and Malik.

122
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,511
We have just Shakeel and
Altaf left as our strong points.

123
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,210
Both Abdullah and I
are aware of this.

124
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,582
If this work is not
done in three days...

125
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:39,055
...then it'll be too late.

126
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:47,065
Do one thing; tell Shakeel
and Altaf that we're coming.

127
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,598
And what they were
supposed to do tomorrow...

128
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:51,658
...they have to do it today.

129
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:55,532
Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

130
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:06,076
Come on.
- Hey guys, come on.

131
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:08,848
Come on!

132
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:10,354
Ask your dad.
- He will not allow.

133
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:11,616
It's a free ticket.
- But he will not allow.

134
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,351
Girls! Why are you sitting here?

135
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:16,019
You're so boring, girls!
Let's have fun! Come on!

136
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:17,619
Purab, she has a problem again!

137
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:18,685
What did you do now?

138
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:20,726
- I didn't do anything. -
Not he! Her dad's problem!

139
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,093
That's it?
- Okay, I'll take someone else.

140
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:25,235
I am not going to waste
my free ticket, please.

141
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,067
Bingo.
- Just kidding!

142
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:29,238
Neha, you won't have any problem.

143
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,798
Your brother is going with you.

144
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:33,837
But dad will never allow me!
- Idea!

145
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,769
Do you have a computer at home?

146
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:37,173
What has computer...

147
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:38,307
Do you have a computer
at home or not?

148
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,050
But computer...
- Yes or no?

149
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,650
No.
- Okay, now listen to the plan.

150
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:43,779
You need a computer
in order to complete...

151
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:44,845
...your college project, right?

152
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,180
Neha has a computer at home.

153
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:47,652
Tell your mom and dad
that you are going to...

154
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:48,988
...Neha's house for 3 days.

155
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,659
And when we'll be enjoying there...

156
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:52,594
...her parents will think
that she is in her house.

157
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:53,923
How's that?

158
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,057
Great!
- Not bad!

159
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:56,601
Yes...
- Alright, come. Let's enjoy.

160
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:02,107
People in the house!
Welcome to Blackout!

161
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,608
We have a special
performance for you tonight!

162
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:08,339
Put your hands together for a
beautiful Brazilian bombshell!

163
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:09,608
Maria!

164
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:19,854
"Move your body."

165
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:51,790
"See to it that it doesn't happen."

166
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:53,825
"We mustn't lose the moment."

167
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,724
"Come on, come on, sing with me."

168
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:01,924
"This shouldn't happen.
That shouldn't happen."

169
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:03,696
"Live your life, you people."

170
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:12,674
"Move your body. Move your body.
Move your body now."

171
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:20,876
"Move your body. Move your body.
Move your body now."

172
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:47,845
"The heart is excited.
We're together."

173
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:49,972
"The atmosphere is pleasant.
We're intoxicated."

174
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:53,314
"You got to lose yourself, baby."

175
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:55,979
"Get mesmerised in
this intoxication."

176
00:15:56,055 --> 00:16:02,051
"Forget yourself. Just got
to lose yourself, baby."

177
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:05,824
"Live your life. Don't
lose this opportunity."

178
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:09,896
"Steal the charm of the moment."

179
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,869
"See to it that it doesn't happen."

180
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:13,871
"We mustn't lose the moment."

181
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:15,839
"Come on, come on, sing with me."

182
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:21,902
"This shouldn't happen.
That shouldn't happen."

183
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,846
"Live your life, you people."

184
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:32,481
"Move your body. Move your body.
Move your body now."

185
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:33,820
"Move your body."

186
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:40,764
"Move your body. Move your body.
Move your body now."

187
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:54,972
"Come on, baby."

188
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:09,851
"This night is with you.
Someone is with you."

189
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:13,455
"What are you waiting for, baby?"

190
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:18,026
"No matter what happens now.
Let anything happen."

191
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:21,869
"What are you waiting for, baby?"

192
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:25,899
"Live your life. Don't
lose this opportunity."

193
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:30,114
"Steal the charm of the moment."

194
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:31,979
"See to it that it doesn't happen."

195
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,985
"We mustn't lose the moment."

196
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,987
"Come on, come on, sing with me."

197
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:42,017
"This shouldn't happen.
That shouldn't happen."

198
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:43,891
"Live your life, you people."

199
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:52,834
"Move your body. Move your body.
Move your body now."

200
00:17:54,039 --> 00:18:01,002
"Move your body. Move your body.
Move your body now."

201
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:09,912
"Move your body. Move your body."

202
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:17,918
"Move your body. Move your body."

203
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:19,861
"Move your body."

204
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:49,954
Last night, the bomb
blast at Blackout club...

205
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:52,155
...was just the beginning, a trailer.

206
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:55,967
If you don't release
Rashid Omar immediately...

207
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:59,231
...in Hazrat, then we will
blast your entire nation.

208
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,966
That's why, it'll be
better for your nation...

209
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,065
...and its people
if you listen to us.

210
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:07,912
Your well-wisher, Abdullah.

211
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,972
Sir, they've sent the
copies of this e-mail...

212
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:12,983
...to all the leading newspapers...

213
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:14,951
...and leading news channels.

214
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:20,283
By the way, Mr. Kumar, where did
this e-mail come from?

215
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:24,123
Well, sir, it has come from
some internet café in Kazakhstan.

216
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,929
Our team is trying to find
out who has sent this e-mail.

217
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:31,134
Sir, the TV and press
reporters have gathered outside.

218
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:35,036
Everyone wants to know whether we
are going to release Rashid or not...

219
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:39,669
We cannot release Rashid.
This is against our principle.

220
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:42,009
You're right, sir.
And even if we release him...

221
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,674
...it might still
not be the end of it.

222
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:49,314
Ms. Simone, the media can be
very useful to us at present.

223
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,955
Just ask them not to
exaggerate the issue.

224
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:56,691
People should not panic.

225
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:00,531
And one more thing, Ms. Simone.

226
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:06,570
Tell them everything without telling
them anything, alright? - Yes, sir.

227
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:15,101
Okay that's good, Kumar.

228
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,640
This plane is for
pre-flight inspection. - Okay.

229
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,707
Inspect its start board wing,
right landing gear and port wing.

230
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:21,650
Alright, sir.

231
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:25,714
And top its engine oil up.
- Alright, sir. - Alright.

232
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:31,059
Hello.
- Betty bought a bitter butter...

233
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:33,120
...to make the bitter butter better!

234
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:34,688
Betty bought some
bitter butter bitter...

235
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:36,165
You lose! You lose! You lose!

236
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:39,999
How's my daughter?
- Papa, I'm fine.

237
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,373
Okay, tell me why I called you.

238
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:44,735
There's surely some good news.

239
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,442
Wrong!
- Wrong?

240
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:51,675
Yes! Wrong!
Not good news but great news!

241
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,739
Then tell me quickly.

242
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:58,115
I won't! You guess!
Come on, come on!

243
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:02,154
You came first in class?
- Half right, half wrong.

244
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:05,753
Half right, half wrong...
you've topped the school!

245
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,259
Right! After all, you're my papa!

246
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:12,100
And papa, I've been selected for...
...the interschool quiz contest!

247
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,764
And we're going to
Amritsar the day after!

248
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,365
And do you know how we are going?
- How?

249
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,103
By air! And teacher Neeta told us...

250
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:22,408
...that our plane will
pass through your airport!

251
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:24,039
Do wave out to me!

252
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,112
Dear, but from such a height...

253
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:28,084
...forget me, even the
airport won't be visible.

254
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:32,116
Still wave out to me!
I'll see! Okay, bye, papa!

255
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,589
Bye! Bye!
- Yes, Priya... Priya! Listen, dear!

256
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,456
Yes. - Don't be mischievous
on the flight.

257
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:36,551
Always tie your seatbelt.

258
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:39,558
And if you need anything...
- Yes, yes papa. I know.

259
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:43,232
I'm not a little baby!
I'm a big girl now!

260
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:46,270
Don't worry, papa.
I'm a big girl now!

261
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,739
Of course, you're a big girl now.

262
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,468
And yes, take care of yourself.

263
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:53,204
Heat food before eating!
Okay, bye, papa! Bye!

264
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:54,802
I love you, dear.
- Love you, papa. - I love you.

265
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,415
Is this blast related to
the release of Rashid?

266
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,147
We have taken the
action that we should.

267
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:07,123
You know that Rashid's outfit
is responsible for this blast.

268
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:09,824
We have found out where
this mail has been sent from.

269
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,153
Now the counter terrorist squad is...

270
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,562
...trying to find out where
these people are operating from.

271
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:15,725
Everything is under control.

272
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,166
Culprits will be brought to book.
There is no reason to panic...

273
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:20,227
And no further comments.

274
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:23,206
Madam!
- Madam, one question.

275
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:25,470
You just heard what the
government has to say.

276
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:27,171
Now we want to show
you some pictures of...

277
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:29,179
...the bomb blast so
that you can understand...

278
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:30,771
...the seriousness of the issue.

279
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:31,838
This is Rupali Shah, Zee news.

280
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:33,775
The pictures that you
see are very shuddery.

281
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:43,260
Philu! Philu!
- What is it? What's the matter?

282
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:45,262
You keep calling out
to me the whole day!

283
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,491
Please get my inhaler.
I can't find it.

284
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:50,194
Of course you can't find it.
It's kept next to you.

285
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:52,862
You'll be able to see it only
when you wear your specs. Simple!

286
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:54,530
Then... then at least get my specs.

287
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:59,308
Oh God! What's wrong with you?
Your specs are with you!

288
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,811
Will you wear it or
should I wear it for you?

289
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:04,315
No, I'll wear it. I'm not
that lazy. - Yes, I know.

290
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,877
You do no work! I know what you are!

291
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:09,887
Listen, just tell me if you're
going to wear this shirt or not.

292
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:13,652
To hell with your shirt! Get
me my inhaler. I can't breathe!

293
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,558
Oh my! The inhaler is
kept right next to you.

294
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:18,220
Hold it. You want me to pump it...

295
00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:19,888
...for you or will you
manage it yourself?

296
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:23,258
No, I know how to pump it.
I'll do it. - You'll pump it.

297
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:26,793
He just keeps calling
out to me the whole day!

298
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,901
Philu.
- What is it? What is it now?

299
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:35,670
Hurry up!
- Philu, I love you!

300
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:39,610
What love? Let me do my work!

301
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,245
Abdullah has informed that...

302
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:45,846
...the security has
been tightened everywhere.

303
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:50,559
That's why, all of us
must take different routes.

304
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:53,260
Some of us might
also have to sacrifice...

305
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:56,698
...their lives in order to
make this mission a success.

306
00:23:56,768 --> 00:24:01,205
God willing. - But I promise,
the day only we will rule...

307
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:05,275
...this world, the
name of every martyr...

308
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:07,504
...will be written in bold letters.

309
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:11,642
We're going for our mission!
Success is waiting for us.

310
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:15,845
God is watching us!
- Success is ours!

311
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:17,752
God is great!

312
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:21,816
Success is ours!
- God is great!

313
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:39,337
Hey, gorgeous! Look who's here!
- Hi!

314
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:41,979
Rajeev, why are you so late?

315
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:44,975
Didn't I tell you he's going
to come? How are you, Vikram?

316
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,984
I always say,
women are always right.

317
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:49,320
Yes, yes. Come with me.
I'll introduce you to everyone.

318
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:54,692
Guys, meet Vikram.
That's Captain Sharma. - Hi.

319
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:55,817
Hello.
- How are you?

320
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:57,794
That's Riya. - Hello. - Hi.
- That's Captain Rakesh.

321
00:24:57,863 --> 00:24:58,921
Hi.
- How are you doing?

322
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,430
And that's Natasha.
- Hello. Nice to meet you.

323
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,332
I am telling you!
He is like that! I mean...

324
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:05,627
Hey! - Yes, yes! I'm coming!
One minute! Yes!

325
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,751
Hey, Vicky!
- Hey, Ashwin!

326
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,386
Isn't it strange?
Whenever I come here...

327
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:07,727
...the most beautiful girl over
here comes and sits next to me.

328
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,334
Excuse me?
- Me?

329
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,333
You have come and sit here.

330
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,373
I have been sitting here
since quite a long time.

331
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:18,068
What's happening?

332
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:19,637
Nowadays she comes
and sits beforehand.

333
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:23,444
Did you know that I was going to
come and sit here?

334
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:27,451
Do you start a conversation
like that with every girl?

335
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:29,813
Just for the special one.

336
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:32,423
But you just said that
whenever you come here...

337
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:36,085
...all beautiful girls over
here come and sit next to you?

338
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:42,096
Actually, you know what,
you just got me! - I did.

339
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:47,002
But I guess that's what
makes you the special one.

340
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:54,935
Vikram.
- Pooja.

341
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:11,788
Are you in a hurry?
- Yes. I am already late.

342
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:13,494
Somebody is waiting for me.

343
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:28,478
It's not good to keep
your husband waiting.

344
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:30,811
And who ever told you I'm married?

345
00:27:31,516 --> 00:27:33,780
Well, husband, boyfriend, whatever.

346
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:39,588
You never give up, do you?
- Never.

347
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:55,164
Can I call you?
- Yes.

348
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:07,507
Number!

349
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:30,864
"This moment is so intoxicating."

350
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:38,140
"Let the moment stop here."

351
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:45,555
"Do you also...

352
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:53,997
...feel what I feel?"

353
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:17,621
"I stay awake in the night
quite often, remembering you."

354
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:25,255
"The sounds of your
heart touch mine."

355
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:30,199
"Why am I so restless?
Is this love? Tell me."

356
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:41,270
"My thoughts question me.
Why am I in this state? Tell me."

357
00:29:55,894 --> 00:30:03,665
"I stay awake in the night
quite often, remembering you."

358
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:11,574
"The sounds of your
heart touch mine."

359
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:36,325
"I'm always
engrossed in your words."

360
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:44,134
"Your fragrance resides in me."

361
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:51,809
"Now my life is with you.
I'm walking on your path."

362
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:59,986
"Accompany me with a smile.
Stay in my arms."

363
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:03,687
"Let's be together.
These moments today...

364
00:31:03,761 --> 00:31:06,355
...might not be there in future."

365
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:30,047
"I stay awake in the night
quite often, remembering you."

366
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:38,085
"The sounds of your
heart touch mine."

367
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:16,259
"You're my days and nights."

368
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:23,973
"My life is in your hands now."

369
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:31,977
"I'll live or even
stop living if you say."

370
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:39,815
"I'll unite my
heartbeats with yours."

371
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:43,855
"I'll be close to you.
I'll share my feelings with you."

372
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:46,294
"Whatever you say."

373
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:10,118
"I stay awake in the night
quite often, remembering you."

374
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:17,856
"The sounds of your
heart touch mine."

375
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:25,495
"Why am I so restless?
Is this love? Tell me."

376
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:34,040
"My thoughts question me.
Why am I in this state? Tell me."

377
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:10,539
Vikram! Vikram! Vikram! Vikram!

378
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,539
Come on, the food is ready.
Come have it.

379
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:15,210
Hi, guys. Everything okay?
- Oh hi!

380
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:16,480
Can I get you something?
- No, thanks.

381
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:17,816
No, thanks. It's fine.

382
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:20,948
"Now my life is with you.

383
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:31,085
I'm walking on your path."

384
00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:45,966
"Accompany me with a smile...

385
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:51,640
...Stay in my arms."

386
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:17,006
"Let's be together.
These moments today...

387
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:24,674
...might not be there in future."

388
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:40,030
I thought I'll be late.
There was so much traffic... - Okay.

389
00:36:40,097 --> 00:36:42,998
Saira, hurry up. We
have a long day ahead.

390
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,024
Let's go.

391
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:55,172
1, 2, 3 and 4! Hey, what are
you doing? This is an airport!

392
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:56,338
Yes, so I've bought tickets.

393
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:57,642
But you haven't bought the airport!

394
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,080
Then go and stand there.

395
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:08,119
Yes okay. Yes.
- Bye!

396
00:37:08,192 --> 00:37:10,717
Hey! Hi, Natasha! I'll just be
back! - I want a window seat!

397
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:13,454
Hi!
- I have to wave to my papa!

398
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:15,726
Priya, no.
- No, teacher! I want a window seat!

399
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,062
Okay, I'm coming back in two days...

400
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:18,294
You're a good girl,
aren't you, Priya?

401
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:19,427
Priya, stop behaving like this.

402
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:21,164
I want a window seat!
- You can wave to your papa later.

403
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,263
Other passengers are waiting.

404
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:26,734
Hello, young lady. What happened?
Why are you so sad?

405
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:28,601
They're not giving me a window seat!

406
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:30,306
I have to wave to my papa!

407
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:36,281
I'm in your flight.
I'll give you a window seat, okay?

408
00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:37,685
Promise?
- Promise.

409
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:42,556
Sure?
- Sure!

410
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:44,750
Yes!

411
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:46,552
Bye!
- Bye!

412
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,564
Mr. Oberoi, if you look after us,
we will look after you too!

413
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,800
Sir, that appointment... Okay.

414
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:33,571
Don't worry. I will
push your file up.

415
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,580
Congratulations, ma'am.

416
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:41,175
Going on your honeymoon?
- Coming from the honeymoon.

417
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:43,743
Back to the grind of
everyday life. How boring!

418
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:46,654
Life is what you make of it, sir.
- Exactly.

419
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:48,157
This is what I tell him too.
- When did you say it?

420
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:51,422
If we want our entire
life can be a honeymoon.

421
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:53,286
There you go, sir!
- Thank you.

422
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:55,832
Sir, you are a lucky man to
have such a wonderful wife.

423
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:59,097
On this I,
completely agree with you.

424
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,327
Come.
- Thank you.

425
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,104
Excuse me, ma'am. We are also back
from our honeymoon.

426
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:09,175
What is this! You
should tell the truth.

427
00:39:09,246 --> 00:39:10,270
I love you, darling.

428
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:13,716
Hey but tell me,
will we get beer there?

429
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:15,775
We will get everything. It's not
as if we are going to a village.

430
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:17,643
Stupid question.

431
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:38,873
Call her, why are you bugging us?

432
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,700
Hey guys, where's Neetu now?

433
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:42,211
I have tried her number.
I don't know.

434
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:43,871
Every time she has to come late.
- Hey guys!

435
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:45,643
Yeah!
- Hi!

436
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:47,206
Wow! Wow! You made it!
- I know!

437
00:39:47,284 --> 00:39:48,410
We are finally going!
- Yes! Yes!

438
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:49,680
Papa wasn't allowing me.

439
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:52,484
Don't ask but I somehow
managed to convince dad!

440
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:55,423
Yes! - Hey, you know, it was
my idea that worked finally!

441
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:56,824
Say thanks to me!
- Thanks a lot.

442
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,486
No, say thanks to God.

443
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:00,228
Good that papa
didn't come to know that...

444
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:02,561
...the bomb exploded in
the disco we were visiting.

445
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:04,323
Otherwise imagine Neha...
- Is her dad a detective?

446
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,391
...He can come anywhere...

447
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,462
...What's your problem with my dad?
- No! No! No!

448
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:08,596
...Why do you always
pick on my father!

449
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:09,730
...What's your problem!
- Hey guys! Guys! Guys!

450
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:10,865
...Guys, please come on.
- Just chill!

451
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:12,340
...Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
- At least we are going...

452
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,503
Yes. - That's enough.
- I know guys, I am so excited!

453
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:17,313
Just imagine!
You and me! All over!

454
00:40:17,381 --> 00:40:19,781
Hey dirty mind, come back!
Not here, okay?

455
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:20,908
She is my girlfriend! - Come on!
Come on! Come on! Come on!

456
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:22,350
Shut up! Let's go.
- Let's go.

457
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,918
Okay.
- Neha, I am feeling very scared.

458
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,314
Why are you feeling scared?
- What if papa comes to know?

459
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:29,791
Hey dumbo, you know Bingo's
plans are always foolproof.

460
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:32,920
Right? - Not foolproof but a
proof that you are a fool!

461
00:40:32,997 --> 00:40:34,794
Okay! Okay! Okay!
Okay! Come on! Come on!

462
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:44,736
Come on, hurry up.
- Yes, sir.

463
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:46,868
Listen. - Yes, sir?
- I want to tell you one thing,

464
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,377
I want a veg meal.
- Yes, sure sir. - Okay?

465
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:50,273
Because the last time when
I was travelling in your airline...

466
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:51,780
...I couldn't get a veg meal.

467
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:53,282
And if I don't get it this time,
this will be the last...

468
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:55,477
...time I will be
travelling with you people.

469
00:40:55,553 --> 00:40:56,952
Yes, sir.
- You can see who I am.

470
00:41:00,524 --> 00:41:01,513
Can I get something spicy?

471
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,582
I am telling you guys!
Do you know what had happened?

472
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,760
What are you doing!
He is a big nut!

473
00:41:38,562 --> 00:41:40,860
What? - How... - Hey Puru,
come on. Come on.

474
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:41,989
Can't you see?
- Oh no!

475
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:44,000
...He will get beaten!
He will get beaten today for sure.

476
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:47,593
Puru...

477
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:50,796
Puru...

478
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:57,772
Finally!
- Finally we are onboard!

479
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,008
...Finally, I was so scared.
- I can't believe it, really!

480
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,341
Let the flight take off, ma'am.
- He is asking for an appointment.

481
00:42:01,418 --> 00:42:02,476
I will get it for you.
- Which is my seat?

482
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:03,542
Seat?
- You're welcome. - This one.

483
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:06,022
The window seat is mine!
- Hey, come here!

484
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:07,352
Hey!
- Hang on, you guys!

485
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:08,948
Move!
- Come! Come!

486
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,958
You guys will never change!
- Hey.

487
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,629
Get mango juice for me.
- For me too.

488
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,689
Pandey.
- Yes?

489
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:22,528
What's the balance?
- That she would tell you.

490
00:42:22,606 --> 00:42:23,595
Hey!

491
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,811
Sameer!
- So? What am I doing? - No!

492
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:31,036
No!

493
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:34,917
I want the window seat, darling.

494
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,462
K.C., you will
always remain a child.

495
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:47,588
Sit down. Sit down.

496
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:49,895
Okay, now that is your seat.
- Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

497
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:51,491
Come on, now sit down.
- Yes!

498
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:52,558
Okay, let me put your...

499
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:59,475
Nervous?
- Yes, my first flight, man.

500
00:42:59,543 --> 00:43:02,774
Relax. The first flight is
always a memorable experience.

501
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:04,074
You will remember it all your life.

502
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:05,410
I was so nervous
on my first flight...

503
00:43:05,482 --> 00:43:07,780
...that I dropped
food on the passenger.

504
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:09,011
Are you serious?
- Yes.

505
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,417
Then what happened?

506
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:11,681
It's a long story.
I will tell you.

507
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:12,847
Pass me two fruits, please.
- Yes.

508
00:43:13,157 --> 00:43:15,421
CJ142 to tower. Ready for takeoff.

509
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,416
Excuse me.
- Thank you.

510
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:19,953
Have you got any juice?
- Yeah, we do have juice.

511
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:22,865
Pineapple or orange?
- Yeah, I will just...

512
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:32,538
Altitude set to 30,000 feet.

513
00:43:43,587 --> 00:43:45,111
Wow! Look, Charlie!

514
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:09,071
Yes sir, how can I help you?

515
00:45:10,808 --> 00:45:12,867
What happened?
- Calm down, everyone!

516
00:45:16,647 --> 00:45:19,878
If you all will listen to me
then nothing will happen to anyone.

517
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,143
This plane has been hijacked by us.

518
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:25,048
All of you one by one
go to economy class.

519
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:28,216
Come on, move. Move fast. Move!

520
00:45:28,792 --> 00:45:30,054
Move fast! Come on!

521
00:45:30,127 --> 00:45:32,652
Excuse me, is this a joke?
- I said move!

522
00:45:32,996 --> 00:45:35,021
Listen, I paid for business class.

523
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:36,794
And you want me to
go and sit in economy?

524
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:38,095
What is this stupidity?
- Shut up!

525
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:39,831
I said move!
- Listen...

526
00:45:40,137 --> 00:45:43,038
Move! - Listen do you
know who you are talking to?

527
00:45:43,107 --> 00:45:46,235
Do you know who I am?
I am a CEO of a...

528
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,180
This is a joke, laugh.

529
00:46:01,825 --> 00:46:03,520
Who all want to sit here?

530
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:31,610
Go inside!

531
00:47:02,085 --> 00:47:04,576
On your seats! Sit down!

532
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:10,048
Oh my God!

533
00:47:12,129 --> 00:47:13,118
Come on!

534
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:16,191
Keep quiet!

535
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:18,327
Do you understand me?

536
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:25,665
Sit! Sit down! Sit down!
- Sit down! I said sit down!

537
00:47:25,742 --> 00:47:26,800
No one will move from their place!

538
00:47:26,877 --> 00:47:29,345
Sit down!
- And no one will use their mobile.

539
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:40,118
Sit! Sit!

540
00:47:41,258 --> 00:47:43,283
Sit!
- Sit down!

541
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:47,158
Sit down!

542
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:49,756
Just, relax! Relax!

543
00:47:51,235 --> 00:47:53,362
Hold on! Hold on!

544
00:47:57,774 --> 00:47:58,763
Cockpit.

545
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:08,145
Talk to the captain and ask him
to open the door quickly.

546
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:12,385
Make him open the door! Quickly!

547
00:48:21,798 --> 00:48:22,787
This isn't working.

548
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,395
I said get the door opened!

549
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:26,725
Okay. Okay!

550
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:34,400
Just a moment! They
shouldn't know of this.

551
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:35,901
Normal!

552
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,085
Good morning, captain. Sarika.

553
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:48,418
I have brought your tea,
sir. Can I come in the cockpit?

554
00:48:48,992 --> 00:48:50,687
Thank you, Sarika,
you can come inside.

555
00:48:55,832 --> 00:48:57,026
Who is the captain of this flight?

556
00:48:57,901 --> 00:48:58,890
I am.

557
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:04,206
I asked; who is the
captain of this flight?

558
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:05,764
You, sir.

559
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,374
Now do as I say.

560
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:18,286
If you make mistake then...
- No, sir. I mean, yes sir.

561
00:49:18,355 --> 00:49:20,220
Take this flight to Dubai.

562
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:25,784
Sorry sir, I don't
have authorisation.

563
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:32,826
We don't need you if you
can't take this flight to Dubai.

564
00:49:32,903 --> 00:49:36,202
No, no, sir. No. I will take
this flight wherever you want.

565
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:38,070
Please, sir. Please. Please.
- Good.

566
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:43,242
Sir, what I meant was we don't
have enough fuel to fly to Dubai.

567
00:49:43,547 --> 00:49:44,741
Not enough fuel, sir.

568
00:49:48,018 --> 00:49:52,011
Which is the nearest airport?
- Chandigarh, sir.

569
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:59,085
Easy day, guys. There
are just two flights?

570
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:03,266
This is CJ142. Request
permission to land at your airport.

571
00:50:04,568 --> 00:50:08,937
This is CJ142. Request
permission to land at your airport.

572
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:10,898
This is CJ142.

573
00:50:10,974 --> 00:50:13,465
Just hold this. - Request permission
to land at your airport.

574
00:50:13,543 --> 00:50:16,774
Negative, CJ142. You are
not scheduled to land here.

575
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:20,248
Sir...
- Listen to me very carefully.

576
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:22,443
This plane has been hijacked by us.

577
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:24,453
And we want to land at your airport.

578
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:26,853
If we don't get the permission
to land within 10 minutes...

579
00:50:26,923 --> 00:50:29,858
...then we will start killing
the passengers in this flight.

580
00:50:29,926 --> 00:50:32,121
What rubbish is this? Is
this some kind of a joke?

581
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:34,524
Request, authenticate user identity.

582
00:50:34,998 --> 00:50:37,466
I repeat request
authenticate user identity.

583
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:39,400
I want to talk to the pilot.

584
00:50:40,103 --> 00:50:42,867
Come on, speak to him.
- He... he is right, sir.

585
00:50:42,939 --> 00:50:43,997
We have a hijack
situation onboard, sir.

586
00:50:44,074 --> 00:50:45,871
Keep recording. Keep rolling.
Keep rolling...

587
00:50:45,942 --> 00:50:47,068
...He has already killed two people.
And captain Singh as well, sir.

588
00:50:47,444 --> 00:50:48,877
Please do as they say, sir. Please.

589
00:50:48,945 --> 00:50:50,879
Or else they will...
- One more thing.

590
00:50:52,115 --> 00:50:53,548
We will need some fuel.

591
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:57,080
So make arrangements
to make our tanks full.

592
00:50:57,421 --> 00:51:00,982
Or else unnecessarily I will
have to use blood instead of fuel.

593
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:08,559
And I don't like killing people.
10 minutes and we will talk again.

594
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:12,130
Hello. Hello CJ142,
come in. do you read me?

595
00:51:12,202 --> 00:51:14,568
CJ142! CJ142, come in.

596
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:19,236
Goddamn it! Shucks!
This is ridiculous.

597
00:51:20,644 --> 00:51:22,111
Put the airport on red alert.
- Yes, sir.

598
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:23,305
Kuljeet.
- Yes, sir.

599
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:24,574
Get me Rajeev on the
line immediately. - Okay.

600
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,576
Karan. - Yes, sir.
- Contact Delhi immediately.

601
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:29,241
Clear runway 15 for
landing and docking.

602
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,582
Divert traffic to 19.
And yes, fire brigade.

603
00:51:33,023 --> 00:51:34,251
Keep the fire brigade on standby.

604
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:36,119
Get me the police
commissioner on line two.

605
00:51:36,193 --> 00:51:37,592
Okay, sir.
- What happened about Rajeev?

606
00:51:37,661 --> 00:51:39,253
Make it quick!
- Sir, Rajeev on line.

607
00:51:40,163 --> 00:51:41,596
Thanks.
- Rajeev.

608
00:51:42,065 --> 00:51:44,260
Gofer Rajeev.
- Listen to me very carefully.

609
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:46,535
Flight CJ142 has been hijacked.

610
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:49,098
And it wants to land at
our airport for refueling.

611
00:51:49,172 --> 00:51:50,230
Did you get that?
- Sir.

612
00:51:50,307 --> 00:51:52,935
Yes. So be ready and
standby for my orders. - Okay.

613
00:51:53,009 --> 00:51:55,603
Oh my God, sir which flight
number did you say it was?

614
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:57,943
Flight CJ142 Delhi to Am...
let it be any flight!

615
00:51:58,014 --> 00:52:00,881
...What difference
does it make, Rajeev!

616
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:02,876
The point is that the
flight has been hijacked!

617
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:05,618
Now standby for my orders and
report when you're in location! Out!

618
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:08,614
Joseph, get ready for
an emergency landing.

619
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:10,620
Sir, engine failure?
- It's not an engine failure.

620
00:52:10,694 --> 00:52:11,888
It's a forced landing.
- Sir.

621
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:14,463
Ambulance and fire brigade
on standby. - Okay, sir.

622
00:52:14,531 --> 00:52:18,399
Fatso, where are you going?
- Vicky, there's been a hijack.

623
00:52:19,102 --> 00:52:21,570
Hijack? Which flight?
- CJ142.

624
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:23,303
Rane, come in. Come in, Rane.

625
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:26,965
Which flight?
- CJ142. Delhi to Amritsar.

626
00:52:27,043 --> 00:52:29,102
Hello, Rane.
- Rane, listen to me.

627
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:30,646
Yes, sir.
- Everything should be ready.

628
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:32,414
Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

629
00:52:32,716 --> 00:52:35,981
What happened?
- Priya is in that flight.

630
00:52:36,052 --> 00:52:38,987
Oh no. ATC has just
informed me that...

631
00:52:39,055 --> 00:52:41,922
...that flight is going to land
at our airport for refueling.

632
00:52:42,392 --> 00:52:44,121
Rajeev, come in, Rajeev.
- Yes, sir.

633
00:52:44,194 --> 00:52:45,991
Rajeev, report to the
security cabin immediately.

634
00:52:46,263 --> 00:52:47,321
Sir, on the way, sir. Yes.

635
00:52:47,397 --> 00:52:48,386
I am there, sir. Yes.

636
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:53,427
Vicky, you stay here. I will go to
the security cabin and come back.

637
00:53:45,488 --> 00:53:47,388
'We have to land this plane.
Do you hear me? '

638
00:53:48,258 --> 00:53:49,384
'We have to land this plane.'

639
00:54:10,814 --> 00:54:14,079
'Sir... sir... - What's going on?
Tell me, what's going on! '

640
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:16,277
'Captain Madan, maintain protocol.'

641
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:17,742
'You will be landing
in three minutes.'

642
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:20,283
'Sir... - Runaway number
eight is clear to land. - Sir... '

643
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,080
'And we have the
commandos in position.'

644
00:54:22,158 --> 00:54:24,683
'What's happening, Vibhat?
What's happening outside? '

645
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:27,353
'Tell me Vibhat,
what's happening outside? '

646
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,762
'Take over. - Captain, our
commandos are in position.'

647
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:35,367
'Don't let anyone
enter the cockpit.'

648
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,102
'As soon as the plane will land...

649
00:54:38,174 --> 00:54:40,199
...our commandos will
take over the plane.'

650
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,547
'And for God's sake please
don't try doing anything heroic.'

651
00:54:48,551 --> 00:54:49,540
'Move, Vibhat! '

652
00:55:00,363 --> 00:55:02,126
'Pooja! Pooja! '

653
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,063
'Pooja! Pooja! '

654
00:55:06,536 --> 00:55:07,525
'Pooja! '

655
00:55:09,706 --> 00:55:11,537
'Pooja! Pooja! '

656
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:16,809
Ask the pilot to keep
giving us the fuel status.

657
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:19,138
Monitor altitude of aircraft,
give me the passenger list.

658
00:55:19,215 --> 00:55:20,739
And get me the head
office on line too. Quick!

659
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:23,081
Excuse me, sir. - What is it?
Can't you see I am busy?

660
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,579
I don't even have time
to talk to you. Got it?

661
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:27,817
I don't think you understand
what problem we are facing.

662
00:55:27,891 --> 00:55:29,825
Sir, I know. I'm just trying to say...
What happened to the fuel status?

663
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,218
That I might be
able to help you, sir.

664
00:55:31,294 --> 00:55:33,091
Vikram! It's not a
technical problem!

665
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:35,564
We have a hijack situation on hand.
- I know, sir.

666
00:55:35,632 --> 00:55:37,156
I just came to tell
you that we shouldn't...

667
00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:39,098
...take the situation
in our hands, sir.

668
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:40,597
We should call the
commandos so that...

669
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:43,434
So that the terrorists get a perfect
excuse to kill our passengers.

670
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,831
Let me do my job,
okay? Now get out of here!

671
00:55:46,309 --> 00:55:48,106
What happened to the head office?
- Connecting, sir.

672
00:55:54,718 --> 00:55:56,447
Hello, Rajesh Kumar here.
- Good afternoon, sir.

673
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,182
This is the ATC
chief Arminder Singh...

674
00:55:58,254 --> 00:55:59,846
...from the Chandigarh airport, sir.

675
00:56:00,256 --> 00:56:04,454
We have an emergency. Flight
CJ142 has been hijacked, sir.

676
00:56:04,928 --> 00:56:07,362
And they want to land at
Chandigarh airport for refueling.

677
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:09,523
What? Is the information verified?

678
00:56:09,933 --> 00:56:12,663
Affirmative, sir. I have
spoken to the co-pilot.

679
00:56:12,736 --> 00:56:13,862
And I have also spoken
to one of the hijacker.

680
00:56:14,637 --> 00:56:15,865
We have recorded the conversation.

681
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:17,398
They have already killed the pilot.

682
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:19,368
We have very little time.

683
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:20,875
You tell me, what are
the orders for me, sir.

684
00:56:20,944 --> 00:56:22,707
Okay fine, just give me a minute.
I will get back to you.

685
00:56:22,779 --> 00:56:24,144
And listen, just stay by the phone.

686
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:28,145
Sir, hello! Hello, sir! Virun!

687
00:56:39,329 --> 00:56:40,318
Hello.
