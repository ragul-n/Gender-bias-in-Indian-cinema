1
00:02:32,463 --> 00:02:35,837
Come and match...

2
00:02:35,837 --> 00:02:43,369
Come and match your
steps with mine.

3
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:10,385
Monsieur!

4
00:03:11,551 --> 00:03:16,546
Whatever is your condition,
it's the same with me.

5
00:03:16,713 --> 00:03:22,582
Match your steps with mine.

6
00:04:05,705 --> 00:04:14,612
My heart is a poet. If it wishes,
then it can be done.

7
00:04:14,736 --> 00:04:23,975
I'm a lover, if I get my loved
one, then I'm at peace.

8
00:04:24,103 --> 00:04:33,637
A fun-filled song can
brighten up everything.

9
00:04:33,966 --> 00:04:38,129
Whatever is your path,
it's mine, too.

10
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:44,122
Match your steps with mine.

11
00:05:11,096 --> 00:05:20,004
I'm intoxicated, my heart
beats with intoxication.

12
00:05:20,129 --> 00:05:29,663
I wander like my piercing gaze.

13
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:39,569
There's more of anxiety, love
increases my desires.

14
00:05:39,694 --> 00:05:45,771
This year doesn't seem to
end, such is my state.

15
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:35,305
Move aside, pal! Please move aside.

16
00:06:59,072 --> 00:07:04,360
Aditya, Anuj is in the hospital.

17
00:07:04,735 --> 00:07:08,230
Which hospital?

18
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:19,177
She screamed so loudly that I...

19
00:07:19,177 --> 00:07:23,216
It's good that he dropped her
home, else she would've...

20
00:07:23,216 --> 00:07:26,752
Anuj's brother.

21
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:32,372
Hello, brother.

22
00:07:46,067 --> 00:07:48,812
You?
- Aditya Srivastava.

23
00:07:48,812 --> 00:07:52,894
The patient inside is...
- He's my brother.

24
00:07:58,014 --> 00:08:01,800
Since when does he have
this asthma problem?

25
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,300
Since he was 6 years old.

26
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:07,252
And his addiction to alcohol
and cigarettes? - What?

27
00:08:07,252 --> 00:08:11,125
Look, Mr. Aditya, whether your
brother does it with your knowledge...

28
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,997
...or he does it without your
knowledge, his problem...

29
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,288
...is going to increase
in both the conditions.

30
00:08:15,288 --> 00:08:18,826
He was somehow saved this time.

31
00:08:18,826 --> 00:08:22,449
But considering his condition...

32
00:08:40,097 --> 00:08:44,884
You were with Anuj. You know that
he has asthmatic problem.

33
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:51,334
Why didn't you stop him from
smoking and drinking?

34
00:08:52,292 --> 00:08:55,790
You brought him till here.

35
00:08:55,915 --> 00:08:59,951
Here onwards, I can take
care of him myself.

36
00:09:48,027 --> 00:09:52,773
Since ACP Thakur has been
posted here, crime has...

37
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:58,395
...reduced by 25-30% and above that...

38
00:10:15,044 --> 00:10:17,123
This is your college fees
and this is the...

39
00:10:17,123 --> 00:10:20,036
...money that you wanted
for the books.

40
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:23,951
Call me up if you
need anything else.

41
00:10:23,951 --> 00:10:26,949
I'll get it while returning
in the evening.

42
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:32,319
Brother, I was thinking that if
you're going to the office then...

43
00:10:34,108 --> 00:10:39,478
Ok. I'll drop you on my
way. Drink the juice.

44
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:14,026
It would have been better
had you slapped me.

45
00:11:14,026 --> 00:11:16,273
Why are you punishing
me by keeping quiet?

46
00:11:16,273 --> 00:11:20,021
Isn't it that you don't want
me to drink any longer?

47
00:11:20,021 --> 00:11:24,017
Then why don't you tell
it to me, yourself.

48
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:28,137
I'm afraid that you
would argue with me.

49
00:11:28,137 --> 00:11:31,632
Now that you've grown old.

50
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:38,042
But remember one thing, Anuj. Your
life isn't yours, but mine.

51
00:11:39,294 --> 00:11:44,329
You've to live, if not for
yourself, then for my sake.

52
00:11:45,036 --> 00:11:50,073
I've brought you up
with my own hands.

53
00:11:50,073 --> 00:11:55,068
Since our parents death.
Do you know, Anuj...

54
00:11:55,234 --> 00:11:58,233
Do you know, Anuj, I've no
one else in this world.

55
00:11:58,233 --> 00:12:00,770
I won't be able to
live without you.

56
00:12:00,771 --> 00:12:04,059
Whether you love me or not,
I love you a lot.

57
00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:08,513
Brother, I'm sorry.

58
00:12:12,675 --> 00:12:15,588
Don't take my words lightly, Anuj.

59
00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:19,085
Stop roaming around with
your spoilt friends.

60
00:12:19,085 --> 00:12:24,205
Else, one day...
- Ok, brother. I'll take care.

61
00:12:24,205 --> 00:12:28,035
C'mon go. You're getting late.

62
00:12:43,354 --> 00:12:48,765
Our brother has come. After
being scolded by his brother.

63
00:12:52,136 --> 00:12:53,633
No, I'm not in the mood.

64
00:12:53,636 --> 00:12:57,131
Bharadwaj's man had come.
He was saying that the...

65
00:12:57,131 --> 00:12:59,128
...question papers would be in
the principal's locker tonight.

66
00:12:59,129 --> 00:13:02,126
If we somehow manage to copy
the question papers and...

67
00:13:02,126 --> 00:13:05,540
...give it to him then he's ready
to pay up to Rs.15000.

68
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:09,619
No, pal. You manage it yourself.
I won't be with you, this time.

69
00:13:10,161 --> 00:13:12,531
Why are you ruining our
lives with your problem?

70
00:13:12,531 --> 00:13:14,488
Yes, Anuj. They're telling
the right thing.

71
00:13:14,488 --> 00:13:17,401
And they know it very well that
this isn't possible without you.

72
00:13:17,401 --> 00:13:20,315
Moreover, your brother forbids
you from drinking and smoking.

73
00:13:20,318 --> 00:13:23,604
Not from committing scams.

74
00:13:23,604 --> 00:13:26,642
Ok. If we've to earn money,
then we've to do so...

75
00:13:26,642 --> 00:13:29,140
...as nicely as possible. Tell
Bharadwaj that the job will be done.

76
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:34,094
But not 15, I want Rs.20000.

77
00:15:03,546 --> 00:15:07,751
Your brother hasn't taken the
question papers out of the locker...

78
00:15:07,751 --> 00:15:12,704
...but he has locked
his future, forever.

79
00:15:15,535 --> 00:15:20,113
The boy who can steal things
for a small amount of money...

80
00:15:20,238 --> 00:15:23,237
...what's the guarantee
that he won't...

81
00:15:23,237 --> 00:15:26,605
...murder someone for more money?

82
00:15:26,605 --> 00:15:29,688
Anuj, will never do like this,
sir. Whatever he...

83
00:15:29,688 --> 00:15:33,892
...has done, he has done
it due to ignorance.

84
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:39,636
Our job is to educate students,
not to shelter criminals.

85
00:15:40,301 --> 00:15:42,339
Hadn't I cared for your
dignity, then I...

86
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,545
...would've handed him
over to the police.

87
00:15:44,546 --> 00:15:46,627
But looking at your
previous record...

88
00:15:46,627 --> 00:15:49,291
...I'm just rusticating
him from the college.

89
00:15:49,292 --> 00:15:52,623
No, sir. Don't do like
that. I promise...

90
00:15:52,623 --> 00:15:55,954
...you that he won't do
such a thing again.

91
00:15:55,954 --> 00:16:00,032
If he's accused of this act,
once, then no college...

92
00:16:00,032 --> 00:16:04,235
...will give him admission. It's
a question of his career.

93
00:16:06,775 --> 00:16:14,642
Tell him to write an application
to the enquiry committee.

94
00:16:17,305 --> 00:16:20,802
I'll try to do whatever I can. But
before that, he has to tell us...

95
00:16:20,802 --> 00:16:23,925
...the names of all his friends
who were with him that night.

96
00:16:23,925 --> 00:16:25,796
I won't be able to do
anything without it.

97
00:16:25,797 --> 00:16:30,667
Ok, sir. Just give
him a day's time.

98
00:16:31,459 --> 00:16:36,454
All his friends' name will be
given to you, by tomorrow.

99
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:42,280
C'mon write their names. Those
who were with you that night.

100
00:16:47,358 --> 00:16:50,354
Didn't you listen?
Write their names.

101
00:16:50,354 --> 00:16:52,686
I won't betray my friends.

102
00:16:52,686 --> 00:16:55,349
What nonsense are you talking?

103
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:59,345
Those who make you steal, those
who make you do wring things...

104
00:16:59,345 --> 00:17:01,634
...do you call them your friends?

105
00:17:01,636 --> 00:17:05,340
Whatever it is, brother,
I can't betray them.

106
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:09,379
You can betray your career.
You can betray your life.

107
00:17:09,379 --> 00:17:11,709
You can even betray your brother.

108
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:13,789
I haven't betrayed anyone, brother.

109
00:17:13,792 --> 00:17:15,705
I did whatever I felt was right.

110
00:17:15,706 --> 00:17:17,911
Had you known about the
right and the wrong...

111
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:19,451
...then you wouldn't have done so.

112
00:17:19,451 --> 00:17:21,033
I want to make something
out of you, and...

113
00:17:21,034 --> 00:17:22,738
...you're becoming something else.

114
00:17:22,739 --> 00:17:25,653
Anuj, if you needed money,
then you could've asked me.

115
00:17:25,653 --> 00:17:28,400
Do you know what would've happened
hadn't I come there, today?

116
00:17:28,401 --> 00:17:30,730
What would've happened?

117
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:33,394
At the most, they would've
thrown me out of college.

118
00:17:33,395 --> 00:17:35,727
Let them do that. Anyway,
I'm not too keen to study.

119
00:17:35,728 --> 00:17:38,390
I'll do some small job.
- What'll you do?

120
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,430
Will you steal? Will you burgle?

121
00:17:40,431 --> 00:17:43,384
Or will you form a gang with them?

122
00:17:43,385 --> 00:17:48,256
Remember one thing, I won't
lower my head for you.

123
00:17:48,381 --> 00:17:51,420
We're decent people. And I won't
let you ruin the honor...

124
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,500
...of our family, while I'm alive.

125
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,498
Don't try to advise me on the
basis of our family, brother.

126
00:17:55,498 --> 00:17:58,412
The name of our family was
ruined on the very day...

127
00:17:58,413 --> 00:18:01,410
...that you fled from
the battlefield.

128
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:04,407
I was thrown out of college,
but you were humiliated...

129
00:18:04,407 --> 00:18:06,862
...publicly and fired from your job.

130
00:18:06,863 --> 00:18:09,692
You are feeling humiliated just
because of this small act of mine.

131
00:18:09,692 --> 00:18:15,438
Till date, I had to bow my head
with shame due to your action.

132
00:18:15,438 --> 00:18:17,102
You're a coward. And I don't want...

133
00:18:17,102 --> 00:18:19,600
...to listen to the
advice of a coward.

134
00:18:19,601 --> 00:18:23,055
Did you listen?

135
00:18:44,534 --> 00:18:48,653
Sir, we were informed about 4-5,
but here, there're 15-20.

136
00:18:48,653 --> 00:18:50,192
Shall we call for the backup force?

137
00:18:50,193 --> 00:18:53,901
The backup force would
take time to arrive.

138
00:21:52,763 --> 00:21:57,507
The way he risked his life to
capture those terrorists...

139
00:21:57,632 --> 00:22:03,667
...we should be proud
of such an officer.

140
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:26,561
You're the best person in this
party. Everyone's talking about you.

141
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:32,680
You don't have any value for me.

142
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,927
These small adventures
are not going to help.

143
00:22:35,927 --> 00:22:40,131
My expectations are a little high.

144
00:22:40,256 --> 00:22:43,710
I know that you'll achieve
something great.

145
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:48,956
That too, will be done. But I
need to be motivated for that.

146
00:22:58,821 --> 00:23:01,731
What are you doing?
Father will notice.

147
00:23:01,734 --> 00:23:05,730
Then let him see. If he sees his
daughter kissing the bravest...

148
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:10,807
...officer of his regiment,
then he'll be pleased.

149
00:23:52,017 --> 00:24:02,798
Don't stop meeting me.

150
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:22,153
Even when angry, don't
break up with me.

151
00:24:22,817 --> 00:24:27,815
I'm a heartless person, darling.

152
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:32,353
Don't think about it.

153
00:25:00,282 --> 00:25:13,686
I'm lost in your love...
all day and night.

154
00:25:13,936 --> 00:25:26,047
Life isn't acceptable
to me... without you.

155
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:32,708
Lovelorn, my heart
is crazy about you.

156
00:25:32,874 --> 00:25:37,745
It's the loveliest, this
relation of ours.

157
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:52,064
O beloved one! Don't build this
relationship with someone else.

158
00:26:27,903 --> 00:26:40,265
In your love... I believe.

159
00:26:41,264 --> 00:26:53,795
Without you this life... is nothing.

160
00:26:54,959 --> 00:26:59,956
In the house of dreams,
in these colors...

161
00:27:00,205 --> 00:27:05,782
...you've brought me.,
to these lanes of love.

162
00:27:05,949 --> 00:27:10,152
O dear one! Don't leave me after...

163
00:27:10,152 --> 00:27:19,352
...bringing me to the
middle of the road.

164
00:27:58,104 --> 00:28:02,891
This is the road through
which the enemy spies...

165
00:28:03,016 --> 00:28:07,885
...enter our country, in some
disguise or the other.

166
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:12,881
We've got information that one
of their most dangerous spies...

167
00:28:13,047 --> 00:28:15,461
...in the guise of a cowherd,
is going to...

168
00:28:15,461 --> 00:28:20,373
...cross the border with
some secret information.

169
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:27,409
We've to somehow get hold
of that secret information.

170
00:28:27,658 --> 00:28:31,903
I don't want to take any kind of
a risk, that's why I'm giving...

171
00:28:32,068 --> 00:28:36,981
...the command to Major
Aditya Srivastava.

172
00:28:37,065 --> 00:28:42,228
Captain Ajay Sharma and 2 soldiers
are with you in this operation.

173
00:29:12,198 --> 00:29:16,441
This is a small child.

174
00:29:16,441 --> 00:29:18,524
This small child is the messenger.

175
00:29:18,525 --> 00:29:23,519
The message must be in
the pouch in his neck.

176
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:29,679
This child doesn't know
that someone is utilizing him.

177
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:34,384
It's the CO's order that
we shoot the messenger.

178
00:29:35,216 --> 00:29:37,461
We can snatch the
message from this child.

179
00:29:37,462 --> 00:29:40,460
And also find out
who has sent him here.

180
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:43,624
This isn't the order. The
order is to shoot the child.

181
00:29:43,624 --> 00:29:47,621
I think, they use some mode or
the other to send the message.

182
00:29:47,621 --> 00:29:52,033
We aren't killing the child,
we're killing the mode.

183
00:29:52,239 --> 00:29:54,817
He isn't a child for us,
he's just an enemy.

184
00:29:54,818 --> 00:29:58,151
I don't find an
enemy in that child.

185
00:29:58,151 --> 00:30:00,149
I can give my life for my duty...

186
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:03,145
...but I can't take the
life of an innocent one.

187
00:30:03,145 --> 00:30:08,557
Do you know the consequences?
- Whatever are the consequences.

188
00:30:24,124 --> 00:30:27,247
Forget what happened.

189
00:30:27,247 --> 00:30:29,451
I've spoken to dad about it. You
just sign this apology letter.

190
00:30:29,451 --> 00:30:33,614
Dad will take care
of everything else.

191
00:30:33,614 --> 00:30:37,196
You know that whatever
I've done, I've done it right.

192
00:30:37,196 --> 00:30:39,276
Yet you want me to apologize?

193
00:30:39,276 --> 00:30:44,064
No, Payal. If I
apologize today, to save my job...

194
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:46,767
...then I won't be able to raise
my head for the rest of my life.

195
00:30:46,768 --> 00:30:49,850
It isn't a question of
your job, but of our life

196
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:53,180
If you don't apologize today, then
you'll be court-martial led tomorrow.

197
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:56,177
You'll be publicly humiliated.

198
00:30:56,177 --> 00:31:01,546
And those who sing praises of your
courage today will hate you tomorrow.

199
00:31:02,211 --> 00:31:05,293
That's why I've called you here.

200
00:31:05,293 --> 00:31:08,206
I'm leaving this city,
forever, tomorrow.

201
00:31:08,207 --> 00:31:10,369
And I want to take
you along with me.

202
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:12,450
I won't be able to
convince my father.

203
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:16,488
You know that he always wanted to
get me married to an army officer.

204
00:31:16,488 --> 00:31:20,236
He's furious with what you've done.

205
00:31:20,236 --> 00:31:23,480
I won't be able to convince him.

206
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,478
The ball is in your court, now.

207
00:31:25,479 --> 00:31:30,143
No, Payal, the ball is
still in your court.

208
00:31:30,226 --> 00:31:33,222
The army court will
give its verdict tomorrow.

209
00:31:33,222 --> 00:31:37,302
But I want to listen to
your decision, today itself.

210
00:31:37,883 --> 00:31:41,215
I understand your problem.

211
00:31:41,215 --> 00:31:47,250
I know that this isn't that easy.
But I don't have much time.

212
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:51,452
Whatever be your decision,
I won't complain about it.

213
00:32:26,294 --> 00:32:30,457
Not only did Major
Srivastava refuse to obey...

214
00:32:30,623 --> 00:32:33,701
...his commanding officer,
but also argued with him.

215
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:38,658
In fact, he didn't even let
Captain Sharma fulfill his orders.

216
00:32:39,404 --> 00:32:42,360
The result of this was
that the enemies crossed...

217
00:32:42,362 --> 00:32:46,315
...the border along with
the secret documents.

218
00:34:22,677 --> 00:34:25,380
Yes, brother.
- Is Anuj with you?

219
00:34:25,384 --> 00:34:29,336
No. Why?

220
00:34:29,503 --> 00:34:32,668
Nothing. I had just scolded him.

221
00:34:32,668 --> 00:34:34,746
Maybe he is upset about that.

222
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:38,538
He didn't return home all night.
And didn't even call me up.

223
00:34:38,538 --> 00:34:40,076
I thought that he must be with you.

224
00:34:40,077 --> 00:34:44,614
Don't worry, where can he go? I'll
call up other friends and find out.

225
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:50,525
The college will start in a few
hours, he'll surely come there.

226
00:34:50,525 --> 00:34:52,438
But this has never happened,
brother.

227
00:34:52,438 --> 00:34:55,519
Whatever happens, he
surely comes to college.

228
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:58,516
He has met me yesterday evening.
He was a little upset.

229
00:34:58,516 --> 00:35:01,429
He didn't tell me anything,
even when I asked.

230
00:35:01,429 --> 00:35:04,717
But he asked me for a coin,
to call up someone.

231
00:35:04,717 --> 00:35:08,838
Aslam had seen him near the
phone booth at around 4 - 4.30.

232
00:35:08,838 --> 00:35:12,503
Whom was he talking to? - Don't
know whom he was talking to.

233
00:35:12,503 --> 00:35:16,456
But then he saw Anuj going
somewhere in a rickshaw.

234
00:35:16,456 --> 00:35:20,452
Don't worry, brother.
We'll find him for you.

235
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:22,949
Yes, brother. We'll
keep you informed.

236
00:35:22,951 --> 00:35:27,528
We'll inform you when we find out.

237
00:35:28,737 --> 00:35:31,900
Hiranandani's had called
up from Mayeker's Tumor's.

238
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:35,105
They wanted to go to Malaysia
through us, via Singapore.

239
00:35:35,105 --> 00:35:38,809
They're a group of 60, sir.
And we've given our quotations.

240
00:35:38,809 --> 00:35:40,474
But they wanted to talk to you.

241
00:35:40,474 --> 00:35:44,427
Shall I call them up?

242
00:35:46,468 --> 00:35:49,590
Sir, what should I
tell the Hiranandani's?

243
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:54,085
Who's Hiranandani?
You please come later.

244
00:36:42,538 --> 00:36:44,534
What's the problem?

245
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:48,905
Sir, I want to file a complaint.
- Then wait. What's the hurry?

246
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:55,481
Even Tendulkar isn't
in such a hurry. Wait.

247
00:36:59,561 --> 00:37:04,472
That's like it!

248
00:37:14,713 --> 00:37:18,585
I'm not able to understand
one thing, what's your problem?

249
00:37:18,585 --> 00:37:20,747
My brother is
missing since last night.

250
00:37:20,747 --> 00:37:25,577
This Sawant's wife too was missing.
He too, had to file a complaint.

251
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:27,076
Later on, he came
to know that she fought...

252
00:37:27,076 --> 00:37:31,695
...with him and went
to her father's house.

253
00:37:31,697 --> 00:37:33,902
Call up his friends,
you'll come to know.

254
00:37:33,903 --> 00:37:36,567
I've asked his friends.

255
00:37:36,567 --> 00:37:40,019
What's his age?

256
00:37:40,019 --> 00:37:45,847
What happened? - I told him to
play carefully. Not to act smart.

257
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:49,887
Now go to hell.

258
00:37:50,221 --> 00:37:55,797
A 21 year old boy is missing.
Not a 16 year old girl.

259
00:37:56,047 --> 00:37:59,793
Then why's he
repeatedly banging my table?

260
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:04,871
Will you file my complaint or not?

261
00:38:05,621 --> 00:38:09,867
I'll tackle him first.

262
00:38:14,903 --> 00:38:17,733
Since when is your brother missing?

263
00:38:17,733 --> 00:38:20,646
No one has seen him since
4pm in the evening, yesterday.

264
00:38:20,648 --> 00:38:23,936
Do you know anything about the law?

265
00:38:23,936 --> 00:38:29,764
I can't file any complaint before
24 hours, since he went missing.

266
00:38:29,764 --> 00:38:32,760
And there's still 2
hours left for 4pm.

267
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:36,088
Get lost now. Come after 4pm.

268
00:38:36,088 --> 00:38:38,086
And if you bang on my table
once again, then along with...

269
00:38:38,086 --> 00:38:41,958
...your brother, you,
too, will be found missing.

270
00:38:41,958 --> 00:38:45,581
C'mon! Move!

271
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:27,204
Your brother will come back,
sir. Drink this water.

272
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:37,987
This age is like that, sir.

273
00:39:37,987 --> 00:39:42,814
In this age, most of the people
forget the road to their homes.

274
00:39:43,813 --> 00:39:49,143
My name is Mehmood.
Everyone calls me Mehmood bhai.

275
00:39:49,393 --> 00:39:52,847
Drink that water.

276
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:08,247
Tell me the name.

277
00:40:08,247 --> 00:40:12,619
I told you. Aditya... - Not yours,
but of the missing person.

278
00:40:14,742 --> 00:40:17,028
Anuj...
- Sawant, did you take my pen?

279
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:21,027
What will I do with your pen?

280
00:40:24,023 --> 00:40:26,355
Tell me the name.

281
00:40:26,355 --> 00:40:30,643
Yadav, did you bet on Tendulkar?
- Don't irritate me.

282
00:40:30,768 --> 00:40:33,181
Don't know what has
happened to this Indian team.

283
00:40:33,182 --> 00:40:34,804
They've been bribed.

284
00:40:34,804 --> 00:40:38,967
Forget their money. Give me mine.
- You won't change.

285
00:40:38,967 --> 00:40:43,047
Here take it. Count it! Count it!

286
00:40:43,047 --> 00:40:46,793
Tell me tomorrow's rates.
- 1 for 2 on New Zealand.

287
00:40:46,793 --> 00:40:49,789
Brother... - What if
Tendulkar scores a century?

288
00:40:49,789 --> 00:40:51,952
Rs.5000 cash, on the spot.

289
00:40:51,954 --> 00:40:55,159
What if he gets out?
- Party. - Party?

290
00:40:55,159 --> 00:40:58,280
You always take my money,
and you'll give me a party?

291
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:01,860
Will you register
my complaint or not?

292
00:41:03,402 --> 00:41:05,313
You've made a joke of it.

293
00:41:05,317 --> 00:41:08,811
I've been begging you
for the past 2.5 hours.

294
00:41:08,811 --> 00:41:10,807
My brother hasn't returned home
since yesterday evening.

295
00:41:10,809 --> 00:41:14,806
And you're more interested
in cricket?

296
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:19,800
What does the govt. Pay you for?

297
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:25,422
For helping the people,
or for watching cricket?

298
00:41:29,085 --> 00:41:30,456
What's happening, Yadav?

299
00:41:30,458 --> 00:41:34,121
Sir, this man...

300
00:41:34,121 --> 00:41:36,951
Sir, I'll tell you.

301
00:41:36,951 --> 00:41:38,239
I've been trying for
the past 2 hours to...

302
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,820
...register a complaint
for my missing brother.

303
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:43,110
But no one is willing
to even listen to me.

304
00:41:43,112 --> 00:41:45,108
Can I ask you something?

305
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:49,855
Who'll be responsible if
something happens to my brother?

306
00:41:53,184 --> 00:41:57,139
Come with me.

307
00:41:59,846 --> 00:42:03,298
Mehmood, order for some tea.

308
00:42:04,923 --> 00:42:10,293
No.

309
00:42:11,125 --> 00:42:14,913
I apologize to you on
behalf of all my men.

310
00:42:14,913 --> 00:42:17,909
Butt believe me, every
policeman isn't like that.

311
00:42:17,909 --> 00:42:21,905
I'm just thinking of my brother,
at the moment.

312
00:42:21,905 --> 00:42:27,108
Is he younger to you?
- Yes.

313
00:42:27,983 --> 00:42:31,480
We had a fight, sir.

314
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:35,307
Actually, he never
talks to me in a high tone.

315
00:42:35,307 --> 00:42:38,887
Actually, I scolded
him a bit too much.

316
00:42:38,887 --> 00:42:42,342
But even then, he
should've come back home.

317
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:45,965
I asked all his friends.

318
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:51,918
But none of them know about him.

319
00:42:51,918 --> 00:42:56,121
I'm not able to understand anything.
I've searched everywhere for him.

320
00:42:56,538 --> 00:42:58,909
What do you mean by everywhere?

321
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:04,195
College, canteen, his
friends' houses... - Hospitals?

322
00:43:05,237 --> 00:43:07,360
God forbid that
something happens to him.

323
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,939
But it's possible that he
may have met with and accident...

324
00:43:09,942 --> 00:43:14,352
...or have tried to harm himself.

325
00:43:15,018 --> 00:43:19,474
Don't get tensed, I'm just
discussing the possibilities.

326
00:43:19,474 --> 00:43:23,010
Do you have any photograph of his?

327
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:26,509
I forgot it in my purse.

328
00:43:26,509 --> 00:43:30,795
It's alright. You
register the complaint outside...

329
00:43:30,963 --> 00:43:33,960
...and give us his details, and
send his photo as soon as possible.

330
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,621
We'll begin our search.

331
00:43:35,625 --> 00:43:41,367
In the mean time, you call up some
hospitals and enquire about him.

332
00:43:48,028 --> 00:43:50,483
Did you admit any casualty case?

333
00:43:50,483 --> 00:43:53,980
Check in the emergency.

334
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:58,099
He must be around 22 years old.

335
00:43:58,099 --> 00:44:03,552
No. He isn't fat.

336
00:44:09,255 --> 00:44:11,461
Amit, is brother there?
- Yes, he is.

337
00:44:11,463 --> 00:44:14,461
Why? Did you find out anything?

338
00:44:14,461 --> 00:44:19,454
Give him the phone, I've to talk
about something important to him.

339
00:44:19,994 --> 00:44:22,451
Do one thing. Come here with...

340
00:44:22,452 --> 00:44:27,070
...brother, as soon as possible.
- Where?

341
00:44:40,684 --> 00:44:43,014
It's just a doubt.
If you see with your own...

342
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:47,471
...eyes, then you
won't be afraid anymore.

343
00:44:59,372 --> 00:45:04,369
Brother, will you show
him the body, just once?

344
00:45:05,032 --> 00:45:08,072
Is this an exhibition of corpses?

345
00:45:08,072 --> 00:45:10,653
You come alone once, come along
with your friend the other time.

346
00:45:10,653 --> 00:45:12,485
Go now. Come in the morning.

347
00:45:12,485 --> 00:45:17,480
Brother, please.
He's his elder brother.

348
00:45:18,146 --> 00:45:24,139
Please, sir. Just
open it for 2 minutes.

349
00:45:24,139 --> 00:45:29,427
Hurry up. If I miss my
last train because of you...

350
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:33,630
...then I'll charge
the taxi fare from you.

351
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:55,027
Do I have to send you an
invitation for coming in?

352
00:45:55,192 --> 00:45:59,355
Come in and see the
face of the corpse.

353
00:45:59,521 --> 00:46:05,349
I can't stand in front of
this corpse all my life.

354
00:46:53,134 --> 00:46:56,131
He has been
encountered in a drug case.

355
00:46:56,131 --> 00:46:58,418
He has been shot by a govt. Bullet.

356
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:00,626
He was wandering about aimlessly.

357
00:47:00,626 --> 00:47:06,246
The police bore a 2 inch
hole in him and put him to rest.

358
00:47:06,246 --> 00:47:12,115
Now look, how he's
stinking like a rotten dog.

359
00:49:00,298 --> 00:49:04,047
Clothes, watch, ID card,
and his wallet.

360
00:49:07,875 --> 00:49:12,535
We found all these
things on the dead body.

361
00:49:14,367 --> 00:49:17,530
Sir.

362
00:49:21,318 --> 00:49:25,271
Please sign here.

363
00:49:25,731 --> 00:49:31,143
The brother who used to sit on
your shoulders, since his childhood...

364
00:49:31,309 --> 00:49:33,306
...taking that same
brother to the...

365
00:49:33,307 --> 00:49:34,637
...graveyard on your shoulder,
is a difficult task.

366
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:38,221
You need courage for that.

367
00:49:38,635 --> 00:49:42,755
May God give you the courage!

368
00:50:14,764 --> 00:50:19,552
What's the name of the dead person?
- Anuj Srivastava.

369
00:50:26,047 --> 00:50:31,666
What's the name of the dead person's
father? - Late Dinanath Srivastava.

370
00:50:38,492 --> 00:50:42,489
Immerse the remains.

371
00:51:04,506 --> 00:51:08,922
Brother!
- I can't do this.

372
00:51:11,875 --> 00:51:18,659
I can't immerse the remains of a
person who was into drug trafficking.

373
00:51:18,869 --> 00:51:21,739
The police doesn't
spend lakhs of rupees...

374
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:24,403
...to train us to kill young people.

375
00:51:24,403 --> 00:51:29,942
I'll immerse his remains, the
day he is my younger brother.

376
00:51:30,438 --> 00:51:37,264
At the age of 10,
you'll have to fulfill...

377
00:51:37,432 --> 00:51:43,385
...the duties of a
father and a brother.

378
00:51:44,425 --> 00:51:49,797
From today, I handover
Anuj's responsibility to you.

379
00:51:55,456 --> 00:52:03,449
Keep his reins tight,
I know that he won't do...

380
00:52:03,657 --> 00:52:10,442
...anything that will ruin
the honor of our family.

381
00:52:10,733 --> 00:52:15,730
I had promised my father.

382
00:52:15,730 --> 00:52:20,641
My Anuj could never
do such a thing.

383
00:52:22,137 --> 00:52:28,088
I know that he can never
do such a disgraceful thing.

384
00:52:28,590 --> 00:52:33,753
But I have to prove
this to the world now.

385
00:52:33,753 --> 00:52:38,996
I won't let my Anuj leave this
world in such a disgraceful manner.

386
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:43,159
Won't let it go.

387
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:49,777
My brother doesn't smuggle drugs.
I'm very sure about it.

388
00:52:49,777 --> 00:52:51,856
Either the police have
a misunderstanding or he has...

389
00:52:51,858 --> 00:52:53,938
...been trapped in a conspiracy.
- See, criminals don't have it...

390
00:52:53,939 --> 00:52:55,977
...written on their faces
that they are criminals.

391
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:58,934
My brother was not a criminal.
I'm very sure about it.

392
00:52:58,934 --> 00:53:01,264
He was caught red handed.

393
00:53:01,266 --> 00:53:05,302
It is mentioned in the police
reports clearly that he was...

394
00:53:05,346 --> 00:53:06,010
...running with 1/2 kg of drugs.

395
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:07,425
That is why I'm telling
you that give me a copy...

396
00:53:07,425 --> 00:53:09,631
...of the report. I want to know
the complete truth about this.

397
00:53:09,631 --> 00:53:11,922
Look, don't try to mess
around with the police.

398
00:53:11,922 --> 00:53:14,918
I've told you, we cannot give
you a copy of the report.

399
00:53:14,918 --> 00:53:18,747
Why can't you give it? Am I not
entitled to know the truth?

400
00:53:18,747 --> 00:53:21,327
I want to know what really
happened to my brother.

401
00:53:21,329 --> 00:53:25,701
Why was it necessary to shoot
him not once but thrice?

402
00:53:25,701 --> 00:53:28,362
Where did the incident take place?

403
00:53:28,364 --> 00:53:30,985
Other than the police was there any
other witness present at that moment?

404
00:53:30,985 --> 00:53:35,063
I want to know what happened...
- Your brother was a criminal.

405
00:53:39,061 --> 00:53:44,347
And he got what a hardcore criminal
deserves in a police encounter.

406
00:53:44,347 --> 00:53:48,052
Look, this is an official matter.

407
00:53:48,052 --> 00:53:51,090
If we start giving a copy of the
reports to the criminal's...

408
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:55,711
...family then we have to open
a new department for it.

409
00:53:55,711 --> 00:53:58,375
Your brother's case has been closed.

410
00:53:58,375 --> 00:54:01,706
Now you can go home and
let us do our work.

411
00:54:01,706 --> 00:54:03,785
But sir, you...
- Enough!

412
00:54:03,785 --> 00:54:07,365
Last time I helped you out as I
thought you were a decent man.

413
00:54:07,365 --> 00:54:09,987
But if you raise your
voice one more time...

414
00:54:09,987 --> 00:54:12,983
...then I have to treat
you in the same way...

415
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:18,648
...as we treat the elder brothers
of other criminals.

416
00:54:22,018 --> 00:54:26,014
You two come with me.

417
00:54:41,041 --> 00:54:46,742
Sir, have a strong heart and
forget about everything.

418
00:54:49,032 --> 00:54:51,155
If you try to scratch
a wound it won't heal...

419
00:54:51,155 --> 00:54:55,027
...but it will open up again.

420
00:54:55,027 --> 00:54:59,855
Let your brother's ashes cool down.

421
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:05,891
The more you try to bring
it out it will hurt more.

422
00:55:06,016 --> 00:55:08,137
My heart still doesn't agree
with it, brother Mehmood.

423
00:55:08,139 --> 00:55:10,471
The charges that they have
put upon my brother...

424
00:55:10,471 --> 00:55:14,467
...that can never be true.

425
00:55:15,090 --> 00:55:18,628
I don't understand how did
he reach Byculla...

426
00:55:18,628 --> 00:55:22,833
...that too with the trucks.

427
00:55:24,164 --> 00:55:28,159
Brother Mehmood, you
have to help me.

428
00:55:28,452 --> 00:55:31,782
There must be a copy to this
report in the police records.

429
00:55:31,782 --> 00:55:37,110
Just get me a copy of that report.
I want to read it myself.

430
00:55:37,110 --> 00:55:39,192
Just think it in this way
that this is the last...

431
00:55:39,192 --> 00:55:43,313
...opportunity to meet my brother.

432
00:55:45,477 --> 00:55:48,764
I know, sir.

433
00:55:48,764 --> 00:55:53,800
I know very well about your
love for your brother.

434
00:55:58,423 --> 00:56:03,168
I just met him for a little
while. He was a nice lad.

435
00:56:07,869 --> 00:56:12,865
You go now, sir. I'll try my best.

436
00:56:14,197 --> 00:56:18,193
If it's possible...

437
00:56:19,233 --> 00:56:23,438
...then within two days you'll
have the copy of that report.

438
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:28,932
Thank you, brother Mehmood.

439
00:56:38,173 --> 00:56:42,211
Sir, some policeman had come.

440
00:56:42,211 --> 00:56:47,164
He didn't give his name. Just
gave this and went away.

441
00:56:47,164 --> 00:56:51,202
Okay.

442
00:57:09,849 --> 00:57:14,846
Stop! I'm telling you
stop or we'll shoot.

443
00:57:20,588 --> 00:57:25,168
I'm telling you stop or we'll
be forced to shoot you.

444
00:57:56,262 --> 00:58:01,298
And when our team reached
by the car, he was dead.

445
00:58:24,443 --> 00:58:30,889
I just met him for a little
while. He was a nice lad.

446
00:58:32,932 --> 00:58:37,262
Look, I have told you
everything that I knew.

447
00:58:37,262 --> 00:58:39,593
You know something,
brother Mehmood.

448
00:58:39,593 --> 00:58:42,631
Something that you
are hiding from me.

449
00:58:42,631 --> 00:58:46,628
According to the police report
someone had tipped them.

450
00:58:46,628 --> 00:58:50,583
They chased Anuj by car.
He didn't stop his car.

451
00:58:50,583 --> 00:58:52,996
So they were forced
to shoot at him...

452
00:58:52,996 --> 00:58:55,994
...which resulted in his death.

453
00:58:55,994 --> 00:59:00,155
If all this is true then
where did you meet Anuj?

454
00:59:00,322 --> 00:59:05,068
I... I... I didn't meet him.
I just saw his corpse.

455
00:59:05,068 --> 00:59:08,273
If you didn't meet him
before his death...

456
00:59:08,273 --> 00:59:13,684
...then how could you say
that he was a nice lad.

457
00:59:17,972 --> 00:59:23,009
Brother Mehmood, I can't
bring my brother back.

458
00:59:23,009 --> 00:59:25,047
But if you answer my question then...

459
00:59:25,048 --> 00:59:29,668
...it might free him
from the wrong accusation.

460
00:59:29,711 --> 00:59:33,997
That day you were saying...
- I was not in my senses that day.

461
00:59:34,371 --> 00:59:37,994
I don't know what I blabbered
on that day.

462
00:59:37,994 --> 00:59:40,074
Whatever those three
people have written...

463
00:59:40,074 --> 00:59:44,695
...in the report is the truth.
I don't know anything else.

464
00:59:44,695 --> 00:59:48,733
Brother Mehmood, please.

465
00:59:53,686 --> 01:00:00,931
Look, I'm a family man. I did
whatever I could do for you.

466
01:00:02,010 --> 01:00:08,130
Now do me a favor. After today
don't try to meet me.

467
01:01:14,105 --> 01:01:17,144
One minute sir.

468
01:01:17,144 --> 01:01:19,224
Where do you want go?
- Room no. 201.

469
01:01:19,224 --> 01:01:22,431
201? Room no. 201 is locked.

470
01:01:22,431 --> 01:01:26,550
Mr. Saxena has left the
room a long time back.

471
01:01:27,759 --> 01:01:29,465
Do you know where he went?

472
01:01:29,465 --> 01:01:31,545
I can't tell you that, sir.
I'm not permitted for it.

473
01:01:31,547 --> 01:01:33,793
Look, I have to meet him,
it's very urgent.

474
01:01:33,793 --> 01:01:35,833
If you want you can talk
to the secretary...

475
01:01:35,833 --> 01:01:41,038
...he has informed me not to
give any one the address.

476
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:45,117
Look, I'm coming from
the insurance company.

477
01:01:45,117 --> 01:01:47,197
I have a draft with me on his name.

478
01:01:47,197 --> 01:01:50,153
If I don't meet him, then
he'll lose Rs. 5 lakhs.

479
01:01:50,153 --> 01:01:54,150
And you will lose Rs. 500.

480
01:01:56,148 --> 01:02:00,143
Thank you, sir.

481
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:12,503
Speak?
- Is Mr. Saxena here?

482
01:02:12,505 --> 01:02:15,836
Who are you?
- Aditya Shrivastav.

483
01:02:15,836 --> 01:02:19,831
Come in.

484
01:02:23,285 --> 01:02:27,282
Speak!

485
01:02:28,822 --> 01:02:31,820
But who are you?

486
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:33,858
I'm the elder brother of Anuj.

487
01:02:33,858 --> 01:02:35,938
Ramona is not at home right now.

488
01:02:35,942 --> 01:02:40,644
Look, you must have known by now
what happened to my brother.

489
01:02:40,644 --> 01:02:43,974
Ramona was his friend.
Can I meet her and...

490
01:02:43,974 --> 01:02:47,181
Ramona cannot meet anyone. The
Doctor has asked her to rest.

491
01:02:47,181 --> 01:02:49,842
But what happened to her?

492
01:02:49,842 --> 01:02:53,256
She is in a deep shock
due to Anuj's death.

493
01:02:53,256 --> 01:02:55,711
If she sees you then she'll
remember everything again.

494
01:02:55,711 --> 01:02:58,210
So, please. You leave this place.

495
01:02:58,210 --> 01:03:01,872
Look... - Look Mister,
your brother is dead.

496
01:03:01,872 --> 01:03:04,869
But my daughter is still alive.
Leave her as she is.

497
01:03:04,869 --> 01:03:06,907
So please go away from here.
- But sir... - I'm telling you...

498
01:03:06,909 --> 01:03:10,905
...please go away from here.

499
01:03:37,586 --> 01:03:42,125
I'm Aditya, Anuj's elder brother.

500
01:03:47,701 --> 01:03:51,947
I... I don't know any Anuj.

501
01:03:51,947 --> 01:03:53,985
Don't say like that. Ramona.

502
01:03:53,989 --> 01:03:56,277
I came all the way from
Mumbai to meet you.

503
01:03:56,277 --> 01:04:00,606
With Anuj... - I didn't do anything.
I didn't do anything.

504
01:04:00,606 --> 01:04:04,518
I don't know any Anuj.
I don't know anything.

505
01:04:04,518 --> 01:04:09,387
I don't know any Anuj.
I don't know anything.

506
01:05:11,992 --> 01:05:16,822
I'm not here to trouble you.
You were in love with Anuj...

507
01:05:16,987 --> 01:05:20,027
That's why I came to meet
you with just one hope.

508
01:05:20,027 --> 01:05:23,646
When he was alive I couldn't
understand him.

509
01:05:23,646 --> 01:05:28,349
And after his death I want to
know everything about him.

510
01:05:28,349 --> 01:05:31,347
Was he really a drug-smuggler?

511
01:05:31,347 --> 01:05:36,385
If yes, then I don't have
any regrets with life.

512
01:05:36,385 --> 01:05:41,711
If this is a lie then I
want to clear his blame.

513
01:05:41,711 --> 01:05:44,043
And I want your help to do this.

514
01:05:44,045 --> 01:05:46,375
I'm staying in hotel Duke's.

515
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:48,454
If by tomorrow morning I
don't get your answer...

516
01:05:48,454 --> 01:05:51,494
...then I'll quietly go away.

517
01:05:51,494 --> 01:05:54,532
If your love for Anuj
was true...

518
01:05:54,532 --> 01:05:58,528
...then you'll definitely
come to meet me.

519
01:06:08,851 --> 01:06:12,849
I knew that you would
Definitely come.

520
01:06:30,747 --> 01:06:36,201
That day after he fought
with you he came to me.

521
01:06:40,737 --> 01:06:44,442
He used to love you so much.

522
01:06:44,442 --> 01:06:49,519
Maybe that's why he couldn't
bear it any more.

523
01:06:51,726 --> 01:06:55,762
He was very disturbed.

524
01:06:56,097 --> 01:07:00,800
Whenever he was in a bad mood...

525
01:07:01,425 --> 01:07:04,130
...we used to go out for a drive.

526
01:07:04,130 --> 01:07:08,460
On that day too, we did the same.

527
01:07:10,416 --> 01:07:13,496
I didn't want to hurt
brother's feelings.

528
01:07:13,496 --> 01:07:17,782
But, I spoke to him in a rage.

529
01:07:17,782 --> 01:07:20,822
It's alright Anuj, it happens
when you are angry.

530
01:07:20,822 --> 01:07:24,818
Your brother also takes cares that
you don't do any thing wrong.

531
01:07:24,818 --> 01:07:27,771
Ramona, whenever I try
to do something nice...

532
01:07:27,773 --> 01:07:31,436
...something or the other goes wrong.

533
01:07:31,436 --> 01:07:34,141
I don't understand
how this could happen.

534
01:07:34,143 --> 01:07:38,471
Don't worry Anuj, I'm sure that
brother will forgive you.

535
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:43,965
No Ramona. Maybe this time he
won't be able to forgive me.

536
01:07:45,838 --> 01:07:48,836
I'm sure that brother
will forgive you.

537
01:07:48,836 --> 01:07:52,875
Everything will be fine.

538
01:08:02,822 --> 01:08:08,400
What is going on here, brother?
What is going on here?

539
01:08:11,813 --> 01:08:16,516
Why are staring at us like this?
- What is your problem?

540
01:08:16,516 --> 01:08:20,554
Working out on a girl so late
in the night in the car.

541
01:08:20,554 --> 01:08:23,215
And you are asking us
what the problem is.

542
01:08:23,219 --> 01:08:25,800
Come out of the car. Come out
and I'll tell you everything...

543
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:29,878
...in detail what the
problem is. Come out.

544
01:08:29,878 --> 01:08:31,918
What are you doing
here at this hour?

545
01:08:31,918 --> 01:08:36,621
I was just talking. I was just...
- License, papers to the car.

546
01:08:36,871 --> 01:08:41,201
You were just talking? Didn't
you get any other place?

547
01:08:41,201 --> 01:08:44,153
Come on. Give your license. - Why
is there any rule that...

548
01:08:44,155 --> 01:08:48,193
...you can't talk here?

549
01:09:06,259 --> 01:09:09,588
Give your license!

550
01:09:09,588 --> 01:09:14,208
Look, I'm a law student. You can't
misbehave with me like this.

551
01:09:14,916 --> 01:09:20,202
You are a law student
but not the law.

552
01:09:22,576 --> 01:09:26,572
Being a law student is very good.

553
01:09:26,572 --> 01:09:31,817
But teaching law to the
law that's very bad.

554
01:09:32,233 --> 01:09:37,103
Look, I was sitting here with
my friend... - License!

555
01:09:37,604 --> 01:09:42,764
He doesn't have it, sir.
- Yadav, search him.

556
01:09:50,215 --> 01:09:53,628
Nothing, sir.
- Search her too.

557
01:09:53,628 --> 01:09:55,626
How can you search
a woman like this?

558
01:09:55,626 --> 01:10:02,536
Why? Madam likes women
touching her than men.

559
01:10:05,322 --> 01:10:08,987
You can't do this. You cannot
misuse your position this way.

560
01:10:08,987 --> 01:10:12,650
Yadav, put him in the car.

561
01:10:12,650 --> 01:10:16,646
On what charges? - I'll show
you on what charges. C'mon.

562
01:10:16,646 --> 01:10:23,724
Charge no. 1. Romancing late
night in a public place.

563
01:10:25,637 --> 01:10:28,635
Charge no. 2. Denying to come
to the police station...

564
01:10:28,635 --> 01:10:33,005
...after getting caught.

565
01:10:33,005 --> 01:10:37,085
Charge no. 3
- Give bad words to an officer...

566
01:10:37,085 --> 01:10:41,246
...attack on them and threatening
them to kill them.

567
01:10:42,329 --> 01:10:44,661
That too after getting drunk.

568
01:10:44,662 --> 01:10:46,367
I'm not drunk but you all are.

569
01:10:46,367 --> 01:10:51,695
4. Raising your voice in front
of ACP Yashwant Thakur.

570
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:53,692
These are all lies.

571
01:10:53,693 --> 01:10:57,773
Raising your voice in
front of the ACP?

572
01:11:02,018 --> 01:11:07,387
Raise your voice in front
of me, huh? You...

573
01:11:11,715 --> 01:11:15,836
Please do something.
Or they'll kill him.

574
01:11:19,416 --> 01:11:23,412
What happened?

575
01:11:26,036 --> 01:11:28,697
Let him go.

576
01:11:28,697 --> 01:11:34,027
You want to start your
romance again. C'mon.

577
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:54,090
I have kept the
medicine in the car.

578
01:11:54,090 --> 01:11:57,420
Anuj has asthma.

579
01:11:57,420 --> 01:11:59,751
This is the police station madam.

580
01:11:59,751 --> 01:12:04,662
After coming here they start
to have asthma and diarrhea.

581
01:12:08,077 --> 01:12:09,782
He will die.

582
01:12:09,782 --> 01:12:15,112
We won't let him die so easily.
There's lot's more to happen.

583
01:12:21,769 --> 01:12:27,016
Call my brother.

584
01:12:32,094 --> 01:12:36,131
I'll call your brother now.

585
01:12:41,418 --> 01:12:45,456
Let him go, sir. He's a kid.

586
01:12:47,952 --> 01:12:51,949
Move!

587
01:12:53,782 --> 01:12:57,778
Please, take him to the hospital.

588
01:13:14,510 --> 01:13:18,173
Sir, he's dead.

589
01:13:18,173 --> 01:13:22,126
What rubbish are you talking?

590
01:13:31,826 --> 01:13:35,862
You all have killed my Anuj.

591
01:13:44,813 --> 01:13:48,849
Let me think.

592
01:13:59,173 --> 01:14:03,211
Hey, put him in.

593
01:14:30,226 --> 01:14:34,472
Let her go, sir. She
is already dead now.

594
01:14:34,472 --> 01:14:38,510
Why to kill her?

595
01:14:56,576 --> 01:14:58,945
Your daughter's lover,
Anuj Shrivastav...

596
01:14:58,947 --> 01:15:03,610
...was killed in a police encounter
a few moments ago.

597
01:15:03,610 --> 01:15:07,896
He was drug runner. Your daughter
was also with him.

598
01:15:07,896 --> 01:15:12,266
What happened to my daughter?
- Nothing happened to your daughter.

599
01:15:12,266 --> 01:15:15,599
She's just in a little shock.

600
01:15:15,599 --> 01:15:18,260
My name is ACP Yashwant Thakur.

601
01:15:18,260 --> 01:15:23,255
Now, listen carefully to
whatever I am going to say.

602
01:15:31,291 --> 01:15:35,617
Did you get your daughter?
- Yes.

603
01:15:35,617 --> 01:15:38,657
Now quietly take her away.

604
01:15:38,657 --> 01:15:41,653
Think as if you two are
now departed from Mumbai.

605
01:15:41,653 --> 01:15:47,648
Don't tell any one or I'll kill
your daughter too. Understood?

606
01:16:16,994 --> 01:16:20,322
If this city sleeps in
the night peacefully...

607
01:16:20,322 --> 01:16:24,318
...that is because of officers
like ACP Thakur.

608
01:16:38,389 --> 01:16:42,385
Don't you ever
feel scared, yourself?

609
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:47,380
I'm scared... but not for my life.

610
01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:52,875
I'm afraid that no criminal
should escape from my hands.

611
01:17:06,735 --> 01:17:09,398
I have to compliment you, officer.

612
01:17:09,398 --> 01:17:13,354
Your work is a very courageous one.

613
01:17:16,768 --> 01:17:19,097
Making a fake case of a single boy...

614
01:17:19,097 --> 01:17:24,219
...then forging his encounter
very well.

615
01:17:24,427 --> 01:17:27,296
After hearing about
your brave deeds...

616
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:29,378
...and listening to the compliments
of these people...

617
01:17:29,380 --> 01:17:33,083
...you must feel very
proud of yourself.

618
01:17:33,083 --> 01:17:36,246
By the way, has your department
recommended...

619
01:17:36,246 --> 01:17:39,744
...your name for the medal or not?

620
01:17:39,744 --> 01:17:41,742
Hey, what rubbish are you talking?

621
01:17:41,742 --> 01:17:45,112
Who let him in? Security,
take him away.

622
01:17:45,112 --> 01:17:47,653
Yashwant Thakur, you
must have shot many...

623
01:17:47,653 --> 01:17:50,733
...innocent people like Anuj.

624
01:17:50,733 --> 01:17:52,813
But from now on you won't be safe.

625
01:17:52,814 --> 01:17:58,394
Because no one had an elder brother
named Aditya Shrivastav.

626
01:18:01,099 --> 01:18:03,179
Whether this city sleeps peacefully.

627
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:07,550
But from now on you won't
sleep peacefully.

628
01:18:08,467 --> 01:18:12,753
This is my promise to you,
an elder brother's promise.

629
01:18:12,753 --> 01:18:16,331
If I don't stop your misuse
of your position...

630
01:18:16,331 --> 01:18:19,704
...then I'll change my name
from Aditya Shrivastav.

631
01:18:38,059 --> 01:18:41,059
You have done a great job. That ACP
was nervous in front of you, sir.

632
01:18:41,059 --> 01:18:43,304
What do you think those cheap
goons will get punishment?

633
01:18:43,304 --> 01:18:46,345
That is what I am trying.
- Do you want to change the system?

634
01:18:46,345 --> 01:18:48,923
I am not fighting with the system,
but with those 3 officers.

635
01:18:48,925 --> 01:18:52,005
What will your next step be?

636
01:18:52,005 --> 01:18:54,001
To ask for justice.
- Will you get it?

637
01:18:54,001 --> 01:18:57,956
Let's see.

638
01:19:14,817 --> 01:19:18,854
I want to get a report
to be written.

639
01:19:21,019 --> 01:19:24,307
You must not be having a pen. - Huh!

640
01:19:24,307 --> 01:19:28,345
Pen.

641
01:19:33,711 --> 01:19:39,085
Whose report do you want written?
- The murder of my brother.

642
01:19:40,622 --> 01:19:42,662
Will you write the report
or should I come...

643
01:19:42,662 --> 01:19:46,699
...after 2 hrs, or 4 hrs, or 6 hrs.

644
01:19:46,699 --> 01:19:50,695
What rubbish you are talking?

645
01:19:50,695 --> 01:19:53,362
What report do you want written?

646
01:19:53,362 --> 01:19:55,439
When your brother has
not been murdered...

647
01:19:55,442 --> 01:19:57,729
...then whom will
you get prosecuted?

648
01:19:57,729 --> 01:20:00,434
Now within 2 minutes, get
lost from here otherwise...

649
01:20:00,436 --> 01:20:02,559
...I will make such a case,
and put you in prison...

650
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:05,724
...that full life you will...

651
01:20:05,724 --> 01:20:08,594
Why did you stop?

652
01:20:08,595 --> 01:20:12,425
Whatever you have to say,
say in front of them.

653
01:20:12,425 --> 01:20:14,505
They should also know, how you
shut the mouth of people...

654
01:20:14,505 --> 01:20:18,170
...who ask for justice.

655
01:20:18,170 --> 01:20:20,250
ACP Thakur, I have come here
as a common citizen...

656
01:20:20,251 --> 01:20:24,996
...to get a report written, of the
murder of my younger brother.

657
01:20:26,744 --> 01:20:30,407
Will the police write my report?

658
01:20:30,407 --> 01:20:34,487
Yadav, write his report.

659
01:20:38,064 --> 01:20:42,436
The name of the person, who
is dead. - Anuj Shrivastav.

660
01:20:42,479 --> 01:20:47,224
Whom is the complaint
against? - You.

661
01:20:51,470 --> 01:20:55,134
What happened? Have you
forgotten your name?

662
01:20:55,134 --> 01:21:02,706
I will remind you, Sunil Yadav,
Yashwant Thakur.

663
01:21:15,237 --> 01:21:20,604
Deepak Sawant, these three have
collectively murdered my brother.

664
01:21:23,146 --> 01:21:27,764
I hope that the police will do
their duty with total sincerity.

665
01:21:32,845 --> 01:21:36,175
Sir, sir, sir, tell
us something at least.

666
01:21:36,175 --> 01:21:38,503
Sir, how much truth is there in
what Mr. Shrivastav is saying?

667
01:21:38,505 --> 01:21:41,168
Look, look... - No comments.

668
01:21:41,170 --> 01:21:44,497
It is a shame for our state,
that 3 officers of yours...

669
01:21:44,497 --> 01:21:47,831
...have become the center of
attention, in the media.

670
01:21:47,831 --> 01:21:50,659
Their deeds are being flung
here by the opposition.

671
01:21:50,661 --> 01:21:54,822
You'll are making the mistakes,
and we have to lower our heads.

672
01:21:54,822 --> 01:21:56,862
Letters are coming from everywhere.

673
01:21:56,862 --> 01:22:01,483
I want a clear report of Anuj
Srivastav as soon as possible

674
01:22:01,483 --> 01:22:05,813
Vinayak Sathe, Home minister,
Maharashtra state.

675
01:22:05,813 --> 01:22:07,934
What the hell is this happening?
What am I suppose to say to...

676
01:22:07,934 --> 01:22:11,182
...the home minister?

677
01:22:11,182 --> 01:22:13,304
This sort of thing has never ever
occurred in my career span of...

678
01:22:13,304 --> 01:22:17,548
...30 years. In order to save the
innocent people I used to...

679
01:22:17,675 --> 01:22:22,336
...cease fire for the criminals.
And today my own department...

680
01:22:22,503 --> 01:22:28,166
...is being accused
of high handedness.

681
01:22:28,871 --> 01:22:31,534
It's all happening because
of that guy, sir!

682
01:22:31,534 --> 01:22:34,532
He doing all this to attract
the media's attention.

683
01:22:34,532 --> 01:22:37,445
I don't have anything to do with
that guy. I want to know it from...

684
01:22:37,447 --> 01:22:41,523
...my own officers as
to what is the truth?

685
01:22:41,523 --> 01:22:45,519
You are aware of my
past record, sir! - One minute!

686
01:22:45,519 --> 01:22:49,559
Yadav, you tell me.
Tell me whether this is true...

687
01:22:49,559 --> 01:22:55,304
...or just a lie? Look, Yadav, you
don't have to get scared from...

688
01:22:55,470 --> 01:23:01,795
...anyone. If you tell me the truth
then maybe I can help you out.

689
01:23:01,923 --> 01:23:04,876
It's a lie, sir! It's
an absolute lie!

690
01:23:04,878 --> 01:23:09,581
The guy is just accusing, sir.
He wants to defame, A.C. P sir.

691
01:23:10,914 --> 01:23:14,952
It's a lie, sir. Absolute lie.

692
01:23:15,576 --> 01:23:22,525
Fine! No doubt I will get to know
what's true and what's not.

693
01:23:25,563 --> 01:23:30,809
But, keep it in mind. If at all any
evidence is produced against...

694
01:23:32,389 --> 01:23:37,845
...you in the court then I will be
the first to act against you.

695
01:23:40,592 --> 01:23:44,630
It was the first instance when
someone insulted me so much.

696
01:23:45,170 --> 01:23:47,625
I feel like shutting the mouth
of the Commissioner.

697
01:23:47,626 --> 01:23:51,289
If you really want to do then
shut that guy's mouth, sir.

698
01:23:51,289 --> 01:23:54,327
If he reaches the court then the
Commissioner will disrobe us...

699
01:23:54,327 --> 01:23:57,657
...and send us back to our homes.

700
01:23:57,657 --> 01:24:00,988
Sawant, is right, sir.

701
01:24:00,988 --> 01:24:08,563
Let's set an accident. Let's put
his house on fire. Sir, I feel like...

702
01:24:08,981 --> 01:24:13,393
We cant do anything! We cant do
anything! That guy is too...

703
01:24:13,518 --> 01:24:18,970
...smart. He is moving
along with the media.

704
01:24:18,970 --> 01:24:21,631
The matter is with the, Home
Minister. If an accident really...

705
01:24:21,635 --> 01:24:24,923
...takes place then we will be
held responsible for that.

706
01:24:24,923 --> 01:24:28,670
Then what should we do? Sit idle
and watch him going to the...

707
01:24:28,670 --> 01:24:33,831
...court. Or meekly
go to the gallows.

708
01:24:38,659 --> 01:24:42,322
He won't go to the court.
- And why wouldn't he?

709
01:24:42,322 --> 01:24:47,233
The fear of policemen is much
intense than their beatings.

710
01:26:16,811 --> 01:26:21,264
Rascal, you file a complaint
against us in our own station.

711
01:26:24,345 --> 01:26:28,340
You want to take us to the court!

712
01:26:28,548 --> 01:26:32,545
Sawant!

713
01:26:38,121 --> 01:26:41,161
You brothers have the same
blood I suppose, huh?

714
01:26:41,161 --> 01:26:45,822
Even he wasn't listening
to us just like you.

715
01:26:45,822 --> 01:26:49,445
What happened to him? He
died like a stray dog.

716
01:26:49,445 --> 01:26:53,564
Even then If you wont listen to
us then maybe you might face...

717
01:26:53,689 --> 01:26:57,436
...the same situation. He had an
elder brother to light his pyre...

718
01:26:57,436 --> 01:27:03,054
...but you don't even have that hope.

719
01:27:14,170 --> 01:27:17,291
Until now I was living for my
brother. But from now I am...

720
01:27:17,291 --> 01:27:21,454
...living to seek vengeance for his
death. Listen it properly...

721
01:27:21,579 --> 01:27:26,615
...Yashwant! Until I don't get
a capital punishment for you...

722
01:27:26,822 --> 01:27:32,402
...people from the court; death
means no harm to me.

723
01:27:42,139 --> 01:27:46,179
Bloody rascal!

724
01:27:48,094 --> 01:27:52,255
Mr. Aditya Srivastav,
sir is waiting for you.

725
01:27:52,255 --> 01:27:54,836
Mr. Rastogi, you don't have worry.
I am here for you. One...

726
01:27:54,836 --> 01:27:59,791
...minute, I will get back to you.

727
01:27:59,872 --> 01:28:01,579
Please come.

728
01:28:01,581 --> 01:28:08,157
Aditya Srivastav, please be seated.
Well done! Keep it up.

729
01:28:09,197 --> 01:28:14,527
I am really impressed with your
response against the police.

730
01:28:15,233 --> 01:28:19,938
I have become a fan of yours.
You see, it's quiet enjoyable.

731
01:28:19,938 --> 01:28:23,599
Anyway. Tell me what will you have?
- Your help!

732
01:28:23,599 --> 01:28:27,720
You are the most reputed lawyer in
this city. If you handle Anuj's...

733
01:28:27,887 --> 01:28:32,590
...case. Then I am sure his culprits
will surely be punished.

734
01:28:32,590 --> 01:28:38,251
Mr. Srivastav, the nation
needs young men like you.

735
01:28:38,251 --> 01:28:40,872
Where is the persistence, courage,
enthusiasm and the...

736
01:28:40,875 --> 01:28:44,996
...will in young people of today's
generation that you posses of.

737
01:28:44,996 --> 01:28:48,824
If you hadn't come to me then
I would have come to you and...

738
01:28:48,824 --> 01:28:53,278
...told that I will
handle this case.

739
01:28:53,278 --> 01:28:57,938
Thank you, sir. Sir, your fee-

740
01:28:59,563 --> 01:29:03,684
Why are you embarrassing me? I
don't want any fees from you.

741
01:29:03,934 --> 01:29:05,849
It's for the first time that some
one has raise his voice against...

742
01:29:05,849 --> 01:29:09,845
...the police and the system.

743
01:29:13,590 --> 01:29:19,128
Mr. Srivastav, I want to join
my voice along with yours.

744
01:29:22,250 --> 01:29:26,287
Payal, he is, Mr. Aditya Srivastav.

745
01:29:30,032 --> 01:29:32,862
And she is, Payal, my junior. You
can give all the details of...

746
01:29:32,863 --> 01:29:36,527
...your case to her.

747
01:29:36,527 --> 01:29:40,563
Payal - Yes sir.

748
01:29:46,309 --> 01:29:50,304
His name was, Anuj.

749
01:29:52,969 --> 01:29:55,630
He squabbled with me and left
the house on the afternoon of...

750
01:29:55,631 --> 01:29:59,795
...29th December.

751
01:30:05,666 --> 01:30:09,662
I knew this rascal would
definitely come here.

752
01:30:10,327 --> 01:30:12,407
There is only one lawyer in this
city who can instill life in this...

753
01:30:12,407 --> 01:30:16,403
...murder case.

754
01:30:55,405 --> 01:31:02,067
Payal! - Actually, it was
important to meet you.

755
01:31:03,731 --> 01:31:06,686
The watchman saw me out, waiting
for you. So he gave...

756
01:31:06,686 --> 01:31:10,682
...me the keys.

757
01:31:13,764 --> 01:31:17,759
Be seated!

758
01:31:23,711 --> 01:31:28,081
I am dismayed by whatever
happened with, Anuj.

759
01:31:29,164 --> 01:31:32,744
I wasn't able to save him. But, I
will definitely get his killers...

760
01:31:32,744 --> 01:31:36,907
...punished.

761
01:31:37,738 --> 01:31:41,068
And that's why I went
to, Mr. Malkani.

762
01:31:41,068 --> 01:31:43,108
It's good that he took, Anuj's
case. - No, Aditya, he hasn't...

763
01:31:43,108 --> 01:31:46,769
...done good
by taking, Anuj's case.

764
01:31:46,769 --> 01:31:48,726
What do you mean to say, Payal?

765
01:31:48,728 --> 01:31:54,264
After your exit, A.C. P Yashwant,
arrived there.

766
01:31:55,760 --> 01:32:01,465
Mr. Thakur? - You!

767
01:32:03,420 --> 01:32:06,751
I am here to give the size
of my neck, Mr. Malkani.

768
01:32:06,751 --> 01:32:09,039
I have heard that you handling
our enemy's case and trying...

769
01:32:09,041 --> 01:32:13,454
...to get us convicted for
the capital punishment.

770
01:32:16,492 --> 01:32:21,403
Payal, I will talk to you later.
- Ok sir.

771
01:32:23,528 --> 01:32:26,148
What are you talking, A.C. P, sir?

772
01:32:26,148 --> 01:32:30,186
My profession will go in shambles
if I dare to do that.

773
01:32:30,186 --> 01:32:32,518
That means you are not handling
the case anymore?

774
01:32:32,519 --> 01:32:36,847
Who said so? I am definitely
handling the case.

775
01:32:37,139 --> 01:32:40,217
What you mean?
- I mean If I don't handle it then...

776
01:32:40,217 --> 01:32:43,505
...some other lawyer might handle.

777
01:32:43,505 --> 01:32:48,168
And the other lawyer might not
be a friend of yours like me.

778
01:32:48,168 --> 01:32:50,331
And that lawyer will produce
witnesses in the court.

779
01:32:50,331 --> 01:32:52,496
He will also produce evidences
in the court.

780
01:32:52,496 --> 01:32:54,952
He will go deep in to the case.

781
01:32:54,954 --> 01:33:00,907
And as far as I know any other
lawyer, if he is intelligent, might...

782
01:33:01,072 --> 01:33:06,942
...make your life hell
along with that guy.

783
01:33:08,814 --> 01:33:13,934
But you don't have to worry. I
am with you. I will fight the...

784
01:33:14,059 --> 01:33:20,760
...for both the sides. I might be
the first lawyer in the whole...

785
01:33:20,927 --> 01:33:27,128
...world who has taken a
case just to loose it.

786
01:33:30,541 --> 01:33:34,537
I don't understand whom to trust?

787
01:33:35,162 --> 01:33:38,159
It's better that you came here.
Or else I wouldn't have known...

788
01:33:38,159 --> 01:33:44,197
...about this. Thanks!

789
01:33:44,528 --> 01:33:48,148
What about your job if, Malkani,
comes to know about you?

790
01:33:48,148 --> 01:33:51,813
How do you expect me to work
with, Malkani, after he...

791
01:33:51,813 --> 01:33:56,434
...deceived you?

792
01:33:57,599 --> 01:34:02,345
I have submitted my resignation!
So, should I make a move?

793
01:34:03,260 --> 01:34:07,296
I will drop you.

794
01:34:11,543 --> 01:34:15,539
Can't we walk a few steps together?

795
01:34:16,912 --> 01:34:21,327
Sorry friend! You can go.
- No problem sir.

796
01:34:28,942 --> 01:34:32,979
Where do you stay?

797
01:34:33,604 --> 01:34:37,643
I am not still far away from you.

798
01:35:05,612 --> 01:35:08,278
Should I go? - Even now you haven't
learn to express your...

799
01:35:08,278 --> 01:35:11,192
...feelings. Aditya, if you want me
to fight, Anuj's, case then why...

800
01:35:11,192 --> 01:35:15,479
...don't you tell me to do so?

801
01:35:18,184 --> 01:35:23,720
I am scared. I am scared for
you might refuse me again.

802
01:35:24,845 --> 01:35:29,259
Anuj, was your brother. But
he was also close to me.

803
01:35:31,340 --> 01:35:36,456
I am also pained at his
death just as you are.

804
01:35:37,997 --> 01:35:42,121
Even I do want to get
his killers punished.

805
01:35:50,443 --> 01:35:52,983
More than I have in myself.

806
01:35:52,983 --> 01:36:00,849
'I hold complains against
you but I also love you.'

807
01:36:03,305 --> 01:36:14,670
' I'm waiting for you all the time.'

808
01:36:16,708 --> 01:36:28,113
'But, now the situation is
unbearable for me, dear.'

809
01:36:53,175 --> 01:36:59,210
'I hold complains against
you but I also love you.'

810
01:37:02,041 --> 01:37:07,492
' I long for you all the time.'

811
01:37:10,407 --> 01:37:16,108
'But, now the situation is
unbearable for me, dear.'

812
01:37:17,192 --> 01:37:22,229
'I really don't know why the heart
wants to forgive you for... '

813
01:37:22,394 --> 01:37:27,347
'... your faults and above
all your betrayal.'

814
01:37:28,762 --> 01:37:39,170
'And I also really don't know why
I love you to such an extent.'

815
01:38:21,501 --> 01:38:26,787
'I never say that you are
unpleasant from the heart.'

816
01:38:28,079 --> 01:38:33,157
'But then also you keep
on committing errors.'

817
01:38:33,157 --> 01:38:38,193
'I never say that you are
unpleasant from the heart.'

818
01:38:38,318 --> 01:38:43,644
'But then also you keep
on committing errors.'

819
01:39:14,280 --> 01:39:19,235
'You take a few steps and
I then will reciprocate.'

820
01:39:20,317 --> 01:39:24,813
'And thus let's end this
tale of tranquility.'

821
01:39:25,896 --> 01:39:30,805
'You take a few steps and
I then will reciprocate.'

822
01:39:31,932 --> 01:39:36,509
'And thus let's end this
tale of tranquility.'

823
01:39:37,550 --> 01:39:42,836
'I really don't know why the heart
forgives all your serenity'

824
01:39:55,572 --> 01:39:58,572
We have to meet two people
in regard to this case.

825
01:39:58,572 --> 01:40:00,652
One is, Anuj's, girlfriend,
Ramona and the other one is...

826
01:40:00,652 --> 01:40:04,648
...constable, Mehmood.

827
01:40:06,269 --> 01:40:10,434
What are you thinking?
- I am not thinking. I am looking.

828
01:40:11,974 --> 01:40:15,970
I am looking at the taxi.

829
01:40:17,260 --> 01:40:20,925
This taxi is all the while around
me since past two days.

830
01:40:20,925 --> 01:40:23,586
And it's standing
here since morning.

831
01:40:23,588 --> 01:40:28,916
Oh! God! That means these people
are keeping a vigil on us.

832
01:40:28,916 --> 01:40:31,621
Then how shall we meet, Mehmood?

833
01:40:31,621 --> 01:40:36,742
We will meet. But after
the night falls.

834
01:40:42,318 --> 01:40:46,983
See! The curtain has
also been slide.

835
01:40:46,983 --> 01:40:50,309
I think the ding-dong starts now.

836
01:40:50,309 --> 01:40:54,099
They might be trying to forget the
pain of the kid brother. Yes!

837
01:41:04,336 --> 01:41:08,710
Sawant! Sawant! Sawant,
get up! Follow them!

838
01:41:34,018 --> 01:41:39,762
'Tan Tanatan tan tan tara! Let's
go along for the last show?

839
01:41:52,706 --> 01:41:56,371
How fortunate these
people are, buddy?

840
01:41:56,371 --> 01:41:58,451
Now, they will sit in some dark
corner and put their arms...

841
01:41:58,452 --> 01:42:02,030
...around each other and
start their own show.

842
01:42:02,030 --> 01:42:07,608
And we'll have to wait here like
watchdogs till, their show ends.

843
01:42:08,025 --> 01:42:13,061
If our destinies are broke in
itself then what the hell shall-

844
01:42:27,755 --> 01:42:32,416
'Should we do this or should we
do that; what sort of mess is it?

845
01:42:32,416 --> 01:42:37,829
Oh! My brother! Oh! My brother!
Oh! My brother!

846
01:42:56,769 --> 01:43:00,095
Stop it here.

847
01:43:00,095 --> 01:43:04,135
Sir, where does, Mr. Mehmood, stay?

848
01:43:08,755 --> 01:43:14,710
Until the climax they are not going
to come out. Give me a cigarette.

849
01:43:15,750 --> 01:43:20,367
That means you will testify
in the court against them?

850
01:43:20,367 --> 01:43:24,782
I will. That day though I refused
to do so in the, Irani hotel.

851
01:43:26,487 --> 01:43:31,023
But, believe me, I wasn't able
to sleep the whole night.

852
01:43:32,814 --> 01:43:36,688
Because I felt that by not helping
you, I am committing...

853
01:43:36,688 --> 01:43:42,430
...the same sin that, A.C. P,
and those two have committed.

854
01:43:43,139 --> 01:43:46,552
They killed you brother and threw
his body on the streets.

855
01:43:46,552 --> 01:43:51,836
And I'm liable for the same thing
by not telling the truth.

856
01:43:51,836 --> 01:43:56,956
What's the difference between
me and those people?

857
01:43:57,831 --> 01:44:01,952
A uniform is a uniform. Be it
a constables or an, A.C. P's.

858
01:44:05,492 --> 01:44:11,150
And by disrespecting it; I am
committing the sin that they did.

859
01:44:12,483 --> 01:44:18,059
I am grateful to you that you
gave me a chance to repent.

860
01:44:21,474 --> 01:44:23,929
When do I have to come to
the court? - Very soon!

861
01:44:23,929 --> 01:44:27,760
If the case is admitted early
morning then we will need your...

862
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:31,631
...testimony very soon. But till
then no one should suspect you.

863
01:44:31,631 --> 01:44:34,878
You go to your home without
bothering about that.

864
01:44:36,211 --> 01:44:38,871
If the, Lord, wishes then the
case might get admitted.

865
01:44:38,875 --> 01:44:44,617
Your honor, Anuj Srivastav, is
one among those criminals...

866
01:44:44,784 --> 01:44:50,695
...who are trying to vitiate the
youth of this county for the...

867
01:44:50,820 --> 01:44:56,688
...sake of money. Anuj Srivastav,
was a drug runner. Yes! A drug...

868
01:44:56,813 --> 01:45:02,434
...runner. He was killed in
a police encounter on the...

869
01:45:02,599 --> 01:45:06,514
...night of 29th December at 11
o'clock when he was trying to...

870
01:45:06,514 --> 01:45:11,256
...flee with drugs in his possession.

871
01:45:11,925 --> 01:45:17,336
Your honor, such cases end with
the life of the criminal.

872
01:45:18,583 --> 01:45:23,456
To get them restarted amounts to
putting back life in a corpse.

873
01:45:23,456 --> 01:45:28,907
In fact, I will say it is something
like wasting the court's time.

874
01:45:30,905 --> 01:45:37,648
So I request the court that
it shouldn't admit this case.

875
01:45:38,938 --> 01:45:44,434
Because, it's not a case at all.
Thank you, your honor.

876
01:45:48,927 --> 01:45:53,715
Your honor, I am aware that
the court's time is precious.

877
01:45:55,255 --> 01:45:57,295
Therefore, instead of giving a
lengthy speech, I would like to...

878
01:45:57,295 --> 01:46:01,625
...show something to the court.

879
01:46:06,952 --> 01:46:10,947
Take this.

880
01:46:19,981 --> 01:46:22,851
Your honor, these are the snaps
of the car, which, according to...

881
01:46:22,854 --> 01:46:25,934
...the police, was being driven by,
Anuj Srivastav. And this is...

882
01:46:25,934 --> 01:46:28,595
...the police report which has
a clear statement that, Anuj...

883
01:46:28,597 --> 01:46:31,970
...Srivastav, was trying to escape
along with the drugs.

884
01:46:31,970 --> 01:46:35,840
The police followed him. They tried
to stop him. They warned...

885
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:39,918
...him twice. And when he didn't
stop. They fired on him. And he...

886
01:46:39,918 --> 01:46:47,787
...died on the spot. Your honor, if
at all, Anuj, was trying to flee...

887
01:46:47,912 --> 01:46:51,907
...from the police then his car's
speed must have been around...

888
01:46:51,907 --> 01:46:54,903
...100 kmph. But I want to attract
your attention to a simple fact...

889
01:46:54,903 --> 01:46:58,025
...that if the driver of a car which
is moving with a speed of 100...

890
01:46:58,025 --> 01:47:00,648
...kmph dies on the spot after being
hit by a bullet; shouldn't...

891
01:47:00,648 --> 01:47:05,978
...the car had met with an accident?

892
01:47:05,978 --> 01:47:08,930
Neither the car got hopped upside
down. Neither it broke...

893
01:47:08,932 --> 01:47:10,639
...down. Neither it suffered any
damage. Instead it stopped...

894
01:47:10,639 --> 01:47:15,342
...in the middle of the road.

895
01:47:16,675 --> 01:47:20,670
Your honor, I, on behalf of my
client, request you to admit the...

896
01:47:20,670 --> 01:47:24,416
...case for the sake of justice.
Thank you.

897
01:47:24,416 --> 01:47:27,996
After going through these
photographs the court is...

898
01:47:27,996 --> 01:47:31,867
...convinced by the prosecution
that there is definitely some...

899
01:47:31,867 --> 01:47:37,028
difference between the police
report and the actual incident.

900
01:47:37,028 --> 01:47:41,773
The court admits this case and
gives the prosecution a chance...

901
01:47:41,942 --> 01:47:46,519
...to produce it's witnesses.
The case is admitted.

902
01:47:51,430 --> 01:47:57,340
The hearing of this case will begin
on Monday from 10 pm onwards.

903
01:48:04,918 --> 01:48:08,746
Mr. Malkani, are you her guru
or it's the other way round?

904
01:48:08,746 --> 01:48:10,827
I think the girl will
make the going tough.

905
01:48:10,827 --> 01:48:14,742
Don't worry, A.C. P, sir. If a new
driver honks the horn too much...

906
01:48:14,742 --> 01:48:19,068
...then it doesn't mean that
he is gonna win the race.

907
01:48:19,068 --> 01:48:24,398
Winning needs experience. And
experience is right ahead of you.

908
01:48:48,126 --> 01:48:52,202
The city is free from any danger
in my presence...

909
01:48:52,202 --> 01:48:56,867
A.C. P, Yashwant Thakur.

910
01:48:59,487 --> 01:49:04,443
He is trying to ruin the respect
that I earned in so many years.

911
01:49:05,523 --> 01:49:09,019
He will accuse me? Accuse
me? He will accuse...

912
01:49:09,019 --> 01:49:11,807
...A.C. P, Yashwant Thakur? - Sir you?

913
01:49:11,809 --> 01:49:16,470
I won't spare that, rascal!
- You are not in your senses.

914
01:49:19,135 --> 01:49:23,130
You will bring me back to my
senses. You will do that?

915
01:49:23,130 --> 01:49:26,001
Thakur, sir, what are you doing?
I am your associate.

916
01:49:26,003 --> 01:49:29,041
Shut up! Shut up! If you had
been my associate then you...

917
01:49:29,041 --> 01:49:33,496
...would have tolerated
my insult in the court.

918
01:49:33,496 --> 01:49:35,826
That, bitch, was accusing me in
front of that judge and you...

919
01:49:35,827 --> 01:49:39,157
...were seated like a mute spectator?

920
01:49:39,157 --> 01:49:42,820
Sir, I am your associate. - You
bloody liar! You are a liar!

921
01:49:42,820 --> 01:49:47,148
Sir, leave him. Sir, leave him.
Sir, please listen to me.

922
01:49:50,144 --> 01:49:54,639
Sir, I have the record room
register. The, Anuj Srivastav...

923
01:49:54,809 --> 01:50:00,717
...police report hasn't
been issued to anybody.

924
01:50:02,550 --> 01:50:08,961
It means someone has stolen it from
there and given it to them. - Yes.

925
01:50:12,289 --> 01:50:16,952
That means someone from our police
station sneaked in to the...

926
01:50:17,117 --> 01:50:23,237
...record room and
worked against us.

927
01:50:25,858 --> 01:50:30,271
It also means that there is a
traitor in our own department.

928
01:50:38,597 --> 01:50:43,715
Come in. Mr. Mehmood, you have
to stay away from your...

929
01:50:43,884 --> 01:50:48,920
...family for some days.

930
01:50:50,251 --> 01:50:53,541
These are some eatables for you.

931
01:50:53,541 --> 01:50:59,409
You don't bother about me. I
am aware of your hardships.

932
01:51:03,572 --> 01:51:09,233
I have spent 25 years
in this police force.

933
01:51:09,567 --> 01:51:14,809
I very well know as to what
I am doing. You go. Go.

934
01:51:20,429 --> 01:51:23,260
Mr. Agnihotri, you are the
principal of the college.

935
01:51:23,260 --> 01:51:26,090
Yes.

936
01:51:26,090 --> 01:51:28,920
Anuj Shrivastav used to
study in your college?

937
01:51:28,920 --> 01:51:31,086
Yes.

938
01:51:31,086 --> 01:51:33,914
Mr. Agnihotri, can you
tell the court...

939
01:51:33,916 --> 01:51:36,912
...that the night that Anuj
Shrivastav was killed...

940
01:51:36,912 --> 01:51:39,911
...in a police encounter,
the same morning...

941
01:51:39,911 --> 01:51:44,197
...you were about to rusticate
him from the college?

942
01:51:46,987 --> 01:51:48,318
Yes.

943
01:51:48,318 --> 01:51:53,771
Can you tell us, why you
were about to do that?

944
01:51:54,148 --> 01:51:58,184
Because Anuj was caught red
handed along with his friends.

945
01:51:58,184 --> 01:52:01,804
Can you tell us, doing what?

946
01:52:02,139 --> 01:52:05,510
He was removing the copies of
the question paper from my locker.

947
01:52:05,510 --> 01:52:10,130
That means. He was stealing,
Milord, He was stealing.

948
01:52:10,130 --> 01:52:13,001
Mr. Agnihotri, can you
tell the court...

949
01:52:13,001 --> 01:52:17,956
...why he was doing like this?

950
01:52:18,164 --> 01:52:22,117
Maybe to copy or...
- To earn money?

951
01:52:29,237 --> 01:52:32,983
For his leisure activities,
Anuj Shrivastav wanted to earn...

952
01:52:32,983 --> 01:52:36,313
...money, he needed money
now and then, Milord.

953
01:52:36,313 --> 01:52:38,976
And therefore he tried to steal
the papers from the college...

954
01:52:38,976 --> 01:52:42,014
...and tried to earn money,
and he was unsuccessful...

955
01:52:42,014 --> 01:52:45,095
...in it, and therefore he went
back to his old profession.

956
01:52:45,095 --> 01:52:48,175
The profession of selling drugs.

957
01:52:48,175 --> 01:52:52,046
But Milord, maybe that day
was very unlucky for him.

958
01:52:52,046 --> 01:52:55,211
He was caught red handed
on that day too.

959
01:52:55,211 --> 01:52:58,041
He knew what a serious crime
he had committed...

960
01:52:58,041 --> 01:53:01,037
...and therefore, even though
the police warned him twice...

961
01:53:01,037 --> 01:53:03,036
...he did not stop,
and therefore...

962
01:53:03,036 --> 01:53:07,863
...the police were forced to
shoot him. And he was killed.

963
01:53:11,193 --> 01:53:16,358
Does the Prosecution wish
question the witness?

964
01:53:17,231 --> 01:53:21,228
Mr. Agnihotri, how many students
must be there in your college?

965
01:53:21,228 --> 01:53:24,224
Roundabout... two thousand
five hundred.

966
01:53:24,224 --> 01:53:27,260
And you know everyone of
these 2500 personally?

967
01:53:27,260 --> 01:53:30,090
No. The truth is that
I don't even...

968
01:53:30,092 --> 01:53:34,255
...know the names of many
of these students.

969
01:53:34,255 --> 01:53:38,251
But you knew Anuj very well
even before this incident?

970
01:53:38,251 --> 01:53:39,291
Yes.

971
01:53:39,291 --> 01:53:42,829
Will you please tell the court
the reason for that?

972
01:53:43,412 --> 01:53:45,077
Because Anuj...

973
01:53:45,077 --> 01:53:47,072
...was one of those students
whom not only me...

974
01:53:47,074 --> 01:53:52,403
...but the whole staff of the
college knew very well.

975
01:53:54,402 --> 01:53:59,438
Mr. Agnihotri, are these
the reports of Anuj?

976
01:53:59,438 --> 01:54:02,434
Yes.

977
01:54:02,434 --> 01:54:05,597
He always used to score
more than ninety percent.

978
01:54:05,597 --> 01:54:07,095
Not only this, in sports,
dramatics...

979
01:54:07,095 --> 01:54:09,095
...dance competitions,
everywhere...

980
01:54:09,095 --> 01:54:13,256
...everywhere, he was number one.

981
01:54:13,256 --> 01:54:16,086
So, Mr. Agnihotri, do you
think that a student...

982
01:54:16,086 --> 01:54:21,956
...like Anuj can do a serious
crime like drug trafficking?

983
01:54:22,247 --> 01:54:25,121
Instead of speaking
to my witness...

984
01:54:25,121 --> 01:54:29,449
...on the basis of proof,
she is asking him guess.

985
01:54:29,449 --> 01:54:31,155
Your Honor, the defense
lawyer wishes...

986
01:54:31,157 --> 01:54:33,153
...to tell us something about
Anuj's character...

987
01:54:33,153 --> 01:54:37,481
...with the help of his witness.
Even I am doing the same.

988
01:54:39,148 --> 01:54:42,144
Yes, so Mr. Agnihotri,
do you think...

989
01:54:42,144 --> 01:54:47,472
...that a student like Anuj
Shrivastav deal in drugs?

990
01:54:52,467 --> 01:54:55,131
The point be noted, Milord.

991
01:54:55,134 --> 01:54:58,130
The witness that has been
brought by the defense...

992
01:54:58,130 --> 01:55:02,291
...lawyer to accuse Anuj
Shrivastav, he's not sure.

993
01:55:08,161 --> 01:55:11,157
Milord, my next witness is a...

994
01:55:11,157 --> 01:55:14,322
...fast friend of Anuj
Shrivastav, Mohit Bhattacharya.

995
01:55:14,322 --> 01:55:15,568
Yes, tell me Yadav.

996
01:55:15,568 --> 01:55:17,152
Since the time the police
report's copy has...

997
01:55:17,152 --> 01:55:19,148
...disappeared from the police
station... - Yes? - Since that...

998
01:55:19,148 --> 01:55:20,729
...time everybody has come
to the police station.

999
01:55:20,731 --> 01:55:24,144
Except one person.
- Who?

1000
01:55:24,144 --> 01:55:27,141
Mehmoodbhai.

1001
01:55:27,141 --> 01:55:28,139
He hasn't come on duty
since two days...

1002
01:55:28,141 --> 01:55:31,510
...nor has he gone home.

1003
01:55:34,509 --> 01:55:36,173
Hey!

1004
01:55:36,175 --> 01:55:38,295
Let him go sir, he is a kid.

1005
01:55:38,295 --> 01:55:42,458
Mehmoodbhai! Friend, what
had we done to him?

1006
01:55:42,458 --> 01:55:45,206
I understood now. How the copy...

1007
01:55:45,206 --> 01:55:47,204
...of the police report
disappeared from...

1008
01:55:47,206 --> 01:55:51,532
...the police station. He has
offered water for too long.

1009
01:55:52,532 --> 01:55:56,528
But you won't get any water.

1010
01:55:57,360 --> 01:55:59,193
He used to drink,
he used to gamble...

1011
01:55:59,193 --> 01:56:03,231
...he used to visit discos,
he hosted parties...

1012
01:56:03,231 --> 01:56:08,019
...he used to do many
things, Milord.

1013
01:56:08,391 --> 01:56:10,262
These habits of his had
increased so much...

1014
01:56:10,264 --> 01:56:13,260
...that he had to be admitted
in the hospital once.

1015
01:56:13,260 --> 01:56:15,256
Now, for all these things,
he couldn't...

1016
01:56:15,259 --> 01:56:18,255
...ask his elder brother for
money, every other day.

1017
01:56:18,255 --> 01:56:23,376
Therefore, he took up a short
cut for this. Milord.

1018
01:56:24,416 --> 01:56:27,246
But that poor man
didn't know that...

1019
01:56:27,246 --> 01:56:30,244
...this isn't the shortcut
of earning money...

1020
01:56:30,244 --> 01:56:35,988
...but it is a shortcut to death.
Shortcut to death!

1021
01:56:43,398 --> 01:56:46,394
Was Anuj your friend?

1022
01:56:46,394 --> 01:56:50,432
Yes. He was my best friend.

1023
01:56:50,432 --> 01:56:54,262
I am very sorry that...

1024
01:57:06,583 --> 01:57:10,621
Did you go with Anuj
to discos frequently?

1025
01:57:11,412 --> 01:57:13,282
Yes.

1026
01:57:13,284 --> 01:57:15,282
So can you tell us,
that in a disco...

1027
01:57:15,282 --> 01:57:20,112
...how many people
of your age go?

1028
01:57:20,318 --> 01:57:24,481
Yes, maybe some four hundred
or five hundred.

1029
01:57:24,481 --> 01:57:26,311
And how many such discos
exist in Mumbai city?

1030
01:57:26,313 --> 01:57:31,224
Counting all the small and
big ones, maybe 200-250.

1031
01:57:31,641 --> 01:57:34,304
That means, with the
calculation of 500...

1032
01:57:34,304 --> 01:57:39,634
...of your age, some 1,25,000
boys and girls go to discos.

1033
01:57:39,634 --> 01:57:40,715
Yes.

1034
01:57:40,715 --> 01:57:44,628
So, did you always tell
at home and go?

1035
01:57:45,626 --> 01:57:47,331
No.

1036
01:57:47,333 --> 01:57:51,454
So it is obvious that the others
didn't tell at home and go too?

1037
01:57:52,329 --> 01:57:53,661
Yes.

1038
01:57:53,662 --> 01:57:57,490
So, even they must be facing
problems to take money from home?

1039
01:57:57,490 --> 01:57:59,655
So then?

1040
01:57:59,657 --> 01:58:00,737
No.

1041
01:58:00,737 --> 01:58:05,818
There are no problems,
something or the other is managed.

1042
01:58:05,818 --> 01:58:08,313
Please point this note, Milord.

1043
01:58:08,313 --> 01:58:11,309
That in Mumbai city, everyday,
almost 1.25 lakh boys and girls...

1044
01:58:11,309 --> 01:58:14,307
...visit discos, without
informing their homes...

1045
01:58:14,307 --> 01:58:18,427
...and managing something
from somewhere.

1046
01:58:18,679 --> 01:58:21,340
So, does the defense
lawyer wish to say...

1047
01:58:21,340 --> 01:58:24,380
...that everyday, almost 1.25
lakhs deal in drugs...

1048
01:58:24,380 --> 01:58:27,376
...just to visit discos?
As for the question...

1049
01:58:27,376 --> 01:58:30,376
...of smoking and drinking,
hiding from the elder brother...

1050
01:58:30,376 --> 01:58:33,871
...I don't think that it is a
crime, but Indian tradition.

1051
01:58:33,871 --> 01:58:39,367
And Anuj was a good Indian, who
respected his elder brother.

1052
01:58:49,729 --> 01:58:51,894
Today's day was pretty good.

1053
01:58:51,894 --> 01:58:55,349
You silenced everybody.

1054
01:58:55,599 --> 01:58:58,595
Won't you come inside?

1055
01:58:58,595 --> 01:59:00,760
I have too much work to do.

1056
01:59:00,760 --> 01:59:02,425
I have to go home first,
I have to give...

1057
01:59:02,425 --> 01:59:04,423
...Mehmoodbhai his food, and
I also have to remind him...

1058
01:59:04,423 --> 01:59:07,586
...that tomorrow in the court...
- Enough.

1059
01:59:07,586 --> 01:59:11,083
You don't have to make
so many excuses.

1060
01:59:22,740 --> 01:59:24,403
Okay, listen. Bring
Mehmoodbhai...

1061
01:59:24,403 --> 01:59:26,402
...on time tomorrow. Tomorrow,
once he testifies...

1062
01:59:26,402 --> 01:59:32,724
...then no one can stop
us from winning.

1063
02:00:10,648 --> 02:00:14,479
There's nothing to be
ashamed in this, son.

1064
02:00:14,479 --> 02:00:16,474
If a person is scared, that
doesn't mean that he isn't brave.

1065
02:00:16,476 --> 02:00:18,474
He is brave, who even
after being...

1066
02:00:18,474 --> 02:00:22,722
...scared reaches
his destination.

1067
02:00:39,371 --> 02:00:43,324
What will we do now, son?

1068
02:01:04,514 --> 02:01:09,673
Hey move the car!
Hey. Move them aside.

1069
02:01:28,862 --> 02:01:33,108
Please give me alms, for
the sake of God!

1070
02:01:35,523 --> 02:01:39,019
Please come out.

1071
02:01:44,474 --> 02:01:47,719
Taxi!

1072
02:02:07,740 --> 02:02:12,568
How much is it?
- Fifty rupees - Take this.

1073
02:02:32,590 --> 02:02:36,086
How much longer will you
make us wait, Miss Payal?

1074
02:02:36,086 --> 02:02:38,583
You told us, that
you don't want to...

1075
02:02:38,585 --> 02:02:41,164
...tell the name of your
witness, the court accepted it.

1076
02:02:41,166 --> 02:02:44,202
You said, that you wish
to keep his identity...

1077
02:02:44,202 --> 02:02:47,534
...a secret, the court
accepted that too.

1078
02:02:47,534 --> 02:02:51,822
But, you are really wasting
the court's time now.

1079
02:02:51,822 --> 02:02:53,693
Your Honor, please, just
a little time more.

1080
02:02:53,695 --> 02:02:57,148
They must be arriving
any time now.

1081
02:03:14,506 --> 02:03:18,711
What is going on, Miss Payal?
Will your witness come or not?

1082
02:03:22,541 --> 02:03:24,579
I am sorry, Your Honor.

1083
02:03:24,581 --> 02:03:27,077
Due to unforeseen
circumstances...

1084
02:03:27,077 --> 02:03:28,992
...I can't present my witness.

1085
02:03:28,992 --> 02:03:31,990
If the witness exists, only then
he will be presented, Milord.

1086
02:03:31,990 --> 02:03:36,568
If there is no witness, how
will he be presented in the court?

1087
02:03:36,568 --> 02:03:39,148
Miss Payal is wasting
the court's time and...

1088
02:03:39,148 --> 02:03:43,559
...throwing muck on the dignity
of three respected people.

1089
02:03:43,559 --> 02:03:45,641
Please your Honor, give us one...

1090
02:03:45,643 --> 02:03:47,639
...more chance to prove
ourselves, please.

1091
02:03:47,641 --> 02:03:52,510
Okay, Miss Payal. But, this
will be your last chance.

1092
02:03:53,594 --> 02:03:55,675
Till the next court
hearing, if you...

1093
02:03:55,675 --> 02:03:58,671
...will not be able to present
any strong evidence...

1094
02:03:58,671 --> 02:04:01,710
...the court will deem
this case baseless...

1095
02:04:01,710 --> 02:04:07,037
...and give decision in
the defense's side.

1096
02:04:41,628 --> 02:04:45,250
I don't want to fight this case.

1097
02:04:45,291 --> 02:04:47,621
What?

1098
02:04:47,622 --> 02:04:50,619
I don't want to fight
this case, Payal.

1099
02:04:50,619 --> 02:04:53,617
What rubbish are you
talking, Aditya?

1100
02:04:53,617 --> 02:04:55,737
To redeem the dignity
of my brother...

1101
02:04:55,737 --> 02:04:58,068
...how many people will I kill?

1102
02:04:58,068 --> 02:05:02,733
Aditya, you didn't kill anybody.
Mehmoodbhai... - Mehmoodbhai!

1103
02:05:02,733 --> 02:05:06,186
I killed Mehmoodbhai. I
wouldn't have forced...

1104
02:05:06,186 --> 02:05:10,680
...him to testify, and nor would
those people have killed him.

1105
02:05:10,680 --> 02:05:13,762
His wife was widowed
because of me.

1106
02:05:13,762 --> 02:05:18,090
His kids were orphaned
because of me.

1107
02:05:19,755 --> 02:05:23,918
But now, now nobody will
die because of me.

1108
02:05:23,918 --> 02:05:28,039
I can't fight this case. Payal.
I can't fight this case.

1109
02:05:28,039 --> 02:05:33,952
I can't fight this case.
- Enough, enough, enough.

1110
02:05:37,155 --> 02:05:40,693
Aditya, you aren't the
killer of Mehmoodbhai.

1111
02:05:40,693 --> 02:05:44,983
It is those who have
killed Anuj too.

1112
02:05:47,979 --> 02:05:51,809
You are trying to show
the truth to the world.

1113
02:05:51,809 --> 02:05:56,554
They are the criminals, who are
trying to hide this truth.

1114
02:05:57,012 --> 02:06:00,675
You will have to fight
this war, Aditya.

1115
02:06:00,675 --> 02:06:04,626
You will have to win this case.

1116
02:06:16,740 --> 02:06:22,110
It's useless. Everything
finished with Mehmoodbhai.

1117
02:06:24,148 --> 02:06:27,813
All our hopes are finished too.

1118
02:06:29,813 --> 02:06:34,014
All the hopes aren't
finished yet, Aditya.

1119
02:06:35,804 --> 02:06:39,717
...make us win this
case even now.

1120
02:06:52,456 --> 02:06:54,452
Did you people see?

1121
02:06:54,454 --> 02:06:59,199
After that incident,
this is her state.

1122
02:06:59,199 --> 02:07:02,778
I tore off every photo
of Anuj, but...

1123
02:07:02,778 --> 02:07:07,023
...she still thinks about
him throughout the day.

1124
02:07:07,192 --> 02:07:08,938
She isn't able to sleep
throughout the night...

1125
02:07:08,938 --> 02:07:14,932
...and even if she sleeps,
she gets up all frightened.

1126
02:07:16,764 --> 02:07:17,970
If somebody speaks
in a high tone...

1127
02:07:17,970 --> 02:07:19,760
...she gets frightened
and wakes up and sits.

1128
02:07:19,760 --> 02:07:23,798
We don't put on the television
in our own home.

1129
02:07:23,798 --> 02:07:25,961
I don't want that she
sees something...

1130
02:07:25,963 --> 02:07:30,335
...that will remind
him of Anuj, and...

1131
02:07:30,335 --> 02:07:33,914
...you people are talking about
taking her to the court?

1132
02:07:33,914 --> 02:07:36,911
See, please leave
us to our state.

1133
02:07:36,911 --> 02:07:40,822
I beg of you with folded hands.

1134
02:07:41,240 --> 02:07:45,737
And please don't come
here ever again.

1135
02:07:48,067 --> 02:07:51,229
Papa.

1136
02:07:51,854 --> 02:07:56,184
Papa. I will go to the court.

1137
02:08:04,259 --> 02:08:08,755
But child, the doctor has told
you not to go anywhere out.

1138
02:08:08,920 --> 02:08:14,375
Lf... - What will happen to me?
At the most I will die, isn't it?

1139
02:08:17,827 --> 02:08:23,740
After Anuj has gone,
where do I live?

1140
02:08:33,146 --> 02:08:39,224
Brother, To give punishment
to Anuj's murderers...

1141
02:08:39,391 --> 02:08:42,970
...I am with you.

1142
02:08:45,925 --> 02:08:50,628
Payal, you can present
your witness.

1143
02:08:50,628 --> 02:08:55,456
Yes, Your Honor, my witness
is, Miss Ramona.

1144
02:09:07,987 --> 02:09:11,233
I am scared, brother.

1145
02:09:11,233 --> 02:09:16,144
Nothing will happen to you,
I am there, isn't it?

1146
02:09:16,144 --> 02:09:22,180
You just don't look towards
them. - Yes. - Okay? - Yes.

1147
02:09:48,693 --> 02:09:53,108
Whatever I will say,
I will say the truth.

1148
02:09:55,729 --> 02:10:01,349
I won't say anything except...

1149
02:10:13,961 --> 02:10:16,083
Don't be scared Ramona,
look at me.

1150
02:10:16,085 --> 02:10:20,206
Look at me, okay. Just answer
whatever I ask, okay?

1151
02:10:20,371 --> 02:10:24,951
We have to punish Anuj's
killers, okay.

1152
02:10:25,617 --> 02:10:29,072
On the night of 29th November,
were you with Anuj?

1153
02:10:29,072 --> 02:10:32,902
Yes.
- Where?

1154
02:10:32,985 --> 02:10:37,938
He had come to my house.
- And then?

1155
02:10:37,979 --> 02:10:41,434
Then, we had gone on a drive.

1156
02:10:41,434 --> 02:10:44,972
What happened after that?

1157
02:10:46,014 --> 02:10:48,260
Police station.

1158
02:10:48,260 --> 02:10:53,006
Police station, but why? Tell
us, Ramona, yes, tell us.

1159
02:10:53,006 --> 02:10:56,003
What happened in the
police station?

1160
02:10:56,003 --> 02:10:58,083
Ramona, look at me,
don't be scared.

1161
02:10:58,085 --> 02:11:00,081
Ramona, look at me,
don't be scared.

1162
02:11:00,083 --> 02:11:02,164
What happened that
night that you...

1163
02:11:02,166 --> 02:11:05,034
...and Anuj had to go to
the police station?

1164
02:11:05,036 --> 02:11:08,532
Try to remember, Ramona,
yes. Tell us.

1165
02:11:08,532 --> 02:11:13,318
I and Anuj were sitting
and chatting in the car.

1166
02:11:14,153 --> 02:11:16,479
He was very worried.

1167
02:11:16,483 --> 02:11:18,021
What was he saying?

1168
02:11:18,023 --> 02:11:22,976
He was saying that he loved
his brother immensely.

1169
02:11:23,144 --> 02:11:28,054
He said that he didn't like
fighting with his brother.

1170
02:11:29,012 --> 02:11:34,965
I... I was trying to make
him understand...

1171
02:11:37,461 --> 02:11:46,869
...when... when those people came.
- Which people?

1172
02:11:47,161 --> 02:11:52,155
Those people took us to
the police station.

1173
02:11:53,155 --> 02:11:57,692
And there...
- There? - There what?

1174
02:11:58,067 --> 02:12:01,563
Those people, with Anuj...
- With Anuj what?

1175
02:12:01,563 --> 02:12:05,559
What did they do with Anuj?
- They, with Anuj...

1176
02:12:05,559 --> 02:12:07,224
Ramona, don't be scared. You
are standing in the court.

1177
02:12:07,224 --> 02:12:08,554
Say whatever you
want to, clearly.

1178
02:12:08,554 --> 02:12:12,095
What did they do with Anuj?

1179
02:12:12,095 --> 02:12:17,090
C'mon, Ramona, tell us.
What happened with Anuj.

1180
02:12:17,090 --> 02:12:20,541
Do you have a license?

1181
02:12:20,541 --> 02:12:25,039
The papers of the car?
- Anuj has asthma!

1182
02:12:31,117 --> 02:12:34,528
They are the people!

1183
02:12:34,528 --> 02:12:38,193
They have killed Anuj!

1184
02:12:38,193 --> 02:12:43,269
They won't spare me too!
They won't spare me!

1185
02:12:43,519 --> 02:12:46,224
They won't spare me!

1186
02:12:46,228 --> 02:12:51,262
Ramona! - They won't spare
me. They'll kill me.

1187
02:12:51,429 --> 02:12:55,259
Nothing will happen to you.
- They'll kill me too!

1188
02:12:55,259 --> 02:12:58,588
Ramona, listen to me.

1189
02:12:58,755 --> 02:13:04,085
The court will resume
proceedings after the lunch break.

1190
02:13:15,405 --> 02:13:20,608
Please take her home.
I will call you later.

1191
02:13:20,608 --> 02:13:22,521
Your Honor, my witness
left before she could...

1192
02:13:22,523 --> 02:13:24,519
...complete what she
was about to say.

1193
02:13:24,521 --> 02:13:27,349
She was badly scared, seeing
some people present here.

1194
02:13:27,349 --> 02:13:29,264
But before she left,
she took the...

1195
02:13:29,266 --> 02:13:33,179
...name of those people
who had killed Anuj.

1196
02:13:33,262 --> 02:13:37,259
The prosecution lawyer is
trying brand my client murderers!

1197
02:13:37,259 --> 02:13:39,255
When she hasn't been
able to present...

1198
02:13:39,255 --> 02:13:41,251
...even a single witness
who can prove...

1199
02:13:41,255 --> 02:13:43,751
...that my clients are murderers.

1200
02:13:43,751 --> 02:13:46,666
Milord, when her witness,
has ran away from court...

1201
02:13:46,666 --> 02:13:51,494
...before I could cross
question her.

1202
02:13:52,202 --> 02:13:54,782
Milord, I will present
such a witness now...

1203
02:13:54,782 --> 02:13:57,862
...whom Miss Payal can ask
countless questions.

1204
02:13:57,862 --> 02:14:02,483
He will answer every question.
He won't run away from court.

1205
02:14:02,483 --> 02:14:06,729
My next witness is,
Dr. M. K Bansal...

1206
02:14:07,184 --> 02:14:12,139
...who is a psychiatrist
in JJ Hospital.

1207
02:14:12,805 --> 02:14:15,635
Dr. Bansal.

1208
02:14:15,637 --> 02:14:18,298
Can you please tell
the court, since how.

1209
02:14:18,300 --> 02:14:21,295
...many. Years are
you curing such...

1210
02:14:21,295 --> 02:14:24,628
...patients who are
mentally unsound?

1211
02:14:24,628 --> 02:14:28,666
Yes, since the past
ten to twelve years.

1212
02:14:28,666 --> 02:14:30,537
Ten to twelve years,
that means...

1213
02:14:30,537 --> 02:14:31,912
...you have a lot of experience?
- Yes.

1214
02:14:31,912 --> 02:14:35,492
Do you know Ramona?
Was she your patient?

1215
02:14:35,492 --> 02:14:37,990
Yes, she used to come
to me for cure.

1216
02:14:37,992 --> 02:14:41,318
And since her boyfriend's
death...

1217
02:14:41,318 --> 02:14:42,818
...she used to stay very worried.

1218
02:14:42,818 --> 02:14:45,313
She used to stay worried,
that means...

1219
02:14:45,314 --> 02:14:48,313
...her illness must have
gone to her mind...

1220
02:14:48,313 --> 02:14:53,307
...and therefore her father
brought her to you?

1221
02:14:53,307 --> 02:14:55,929
Yes. She had lost
her confidence.

1222
02:14:55,929 --> 02:14:57,300
She had lost her confidence,

1223
02:14:57,304 --> 02:15:01,300
That means, in medical
or technical terms...

1224
02:15:01,300 --> 02:15:05,420
...we can say that... she
was mentally weak.

1225
02:15:05,711 --> 02:15:09,166
You can say like that.

1226
02:15:09,291 --> 02:15:11,789
The prosecution lawyer
wants to present...

1227
02:15:11,791 --> 02:15:14,367
...a mad girl as a witness
and chance...

1228
02:15:14,369 --> 02:15:16,367
...the direction of
the case, Milord.

1229
02:15:16,367 --> 02:15:19,363
Such a girl, who thinks
up anything after...

1230
02:15:19,363 --> 02:15:23,277
...the death of her lover,
she makes up any stories.

1231
02:15:23,277 --> 02:15:26,358
But our friend, lawyer
Payal should...

1232
02:15:26,358 --> 02:15:29,521
...know that the court doesn't
believe in stories...

1233
02:15:29,521 --> 02:15:36,139
...but valid proof. Therefore,
it is my request to the court...

1234
02:15:36,389 --> 02:15:39,470
...instead of troubling my
clients any further...

1235
02:15:39,470 --> 02:15:43,423
...please deem this case null
and void, here itself.

1236
02:15:43,423 --> 02:15:46,630
The proof that the prosecution
has presented...

1237
02:15:46,630 --> 02:15:49,460
...is not enough to deem
Yashwant Thakur...

1238
02:15:49,460 --> 02:15:53,621
...and his two friends
guilty. Therefore...

1239
02:15:53,621 --> 02:15:57,409
...this court, stops this
case right here...

1240
02:15:57,409 --> 02:16:03,403
...and honorably releases these
three from his accusation.

1241
02:16:04,318 --> 02:16:08,398
Well done! Well done!

1242
02:16:09,439 --> 02:16:13,559
You didn't need to worry.

1243
02:16:24,881 --> 02:16:27,836
See, a dog barks makes
no difference...

1244
02:16:27,838 --> 02:16:31,751
...to the path of an elephant.
The decision is out, isn't it?

1245
02:16:31,751 --> 02:16:34,415
It is crystal clear.

1246
02:16:34,416 --> 02:16:36,036
And if you ask me,
I don't have any...

1247
02:16:36,037 --> 02:16:38,327
. complaints against anybody
in this matter.

1248
02:16:38,328 --> 02:16:40,823
Not even against those
people who tried...

1249
02:16:40,825 --> 02:16:44,363
...to throw muck on our
spotless uniform.

1250
02:16:44,363 --> 02:16:47,861
And the fact is that... I don't
feel angry on such people...

1251
02:16:47,861 --> 02:16:50,856
...but I feel pity.
Anybody can lose...

1252
02:16:50,856 --> 02:16:54,893
...his senses on seeing his
younger brother's corpse.

1253
02:16:54,893 --> 02:16:57,806
And then, he was a son more
than a younger brother.

1254
02:16:57,808 --> 02:17:00,639
And a son may be a wretch
of the third order...

1255
02:17:00,640 --> 02:17:04,052
...but he is a son.

1256
02:17:19,371 --> 02:17:21,492
What are you doing?

1257
02:17:21,492 --> 02:17:24,573
One day, I had thrown away my
weapons for an innocent.

1258
02:17:24,573 --> 02:17:26,737
Today, I am taking up
my weapons once again.

1259
02:17:26,738 --> 02:17:28,568
Aditya, listen to me. We will
appeal in the High Court.

1260
02:17:28,569 --> 02:17:30,400
We will go to the Supreme
court with proof.

1261
02:17:30,400 --> 02:17:32,064
We will get justice...
- Who will give us justice?

1262
02:17:32,065 --> 02:17:34,561
Who will give us justice?
A dead constable?

1263
02:17:34,563 --> 02:17:40,391
A scared girl? A runaway soldier
or a broken relationship?

1264
02:17:40,391 --> 02:17:45,510
All these are not enough to
give my brother justice.

1265
02:17:45,719 --> 02:17:48,588
Don't be crazy, rage has
gone to your head!

1266
02:17:48,590 --> 02:17:50,755
So? You wanted to see rage
in my eyes didn't you?

1267
02:17:50,755 --> 02:17:54,461
One day, I didn't shed blood
and your dignity fell.

1268
02:17:54,461 --> 02:17:55,999
Today, I am going to
fight a war and...

1269
02:17:55,999 --> 02:17:58,037
...that too for my brother. Why
are you stopping me today?

1270
02:17:58,040 --> 02:18:01,703
Because, I was wrong then,
today you are wrong.

1271
02:18:01,703 --> 02:18:04,865
I have lost you because
of that mistake once.

1272
02:18:04,865 --> 02:18:06,614
I don't want to lose
you again today.

1273
02:18:06,615 --> 02:18:09,111
Aditya, have a little faith in me.

1274
02:18:09,111 --> 02:18:12,443
I will surely send Anuj's
killers to the noose.

1275
02:18:12,443 --> 02:18:16,105
But till that time, tolerate...
- Tolerate! Tolerate! Tolerate!

1276
02:18:16,105 --> 02:18:20,016
That's what I have been
doing till date.

1277
02:18:20,435 --> 02:18:22,431
Even though I was right,
I was deemed...

1278
02:18:22,433 --> 02:18:25,472
...a coward, and sacked.
I tolerated it.

1279
02:18:25,472 --> 02:18:27,965
The one who I loved the most, left...

1280
02:18:27,966 --> 02:18:31,756
...me in the middle of the journey.
I tolerated it.

1281
02:18:31,756 --> 02:18:35,918
They falsely accused my brother
and gave him a dog's death.

1282
02:18:35,918 --> 02:18:40,331
I tolerated it. With the same
hands that I brought him up...

1283
02:18:40,456 --> 02:18:45,575
...with those hands I had to
set afire his funeral pyre.

1284
02:18:45,575 --> 02:18:49,070
I tolerated it.

1285
02:18:49,070 --> 02:18:51,445
But now.

1286
02:18:51,445 --> 02:18:56,024
I won't tolerate to see my
brother's killer roaming around.

1287
02:18:57,061 --> 02:19:00,016
The people who snatched
my Anuj from me...

1288
02:19:00,018 --> 02:19:04,097
...I will snatch away
their life from them.

1289
02:19:04,097 --> 02:19:08,593
Adi listen to me, what
are you going to do?

1290
02:19:08,594 --> 02:19:14,756
Adi, listen to me, Adi, please wait!

1291
02:19:18,750 --> 02:19:22,787
Hey, don't let him come inside!

1292
02:19:57,837 --> 02:20:01,956
That wretched dog has come again!

1293
02:20:56,695 --> 02:20:59,606
You will repent! You
will repent too much!

1294
02:20:59,608 --> 02:21:01,772
If I don't take you back
to the police station...

1295
02:21:01,773 --> 02:21:03,936
...you picked me up,
and break you up...

1296
02:21:03,936 --> 02:21:07,516
...then my name isn't Thakur.

1297
02:21:12,760 --> 02:21:16,091
Don't bark.

1298
02:21:39,900 --> 02:21:41,899
Sir!

1299
02:21:41,899 --> 02:21:43,063
What is the position?

1300
02:21:43,064 --> 02:21:45,186
Sir, they are on the 24th floor.

1301
02:21:45,186 --> 02:21:46,685
Why aren't you going inside?

1302
02:21:46,686 --> 02:21:52,263
Sir, we are worried whether
he hurts them.

1303
02:21:53,927 --> 02:21:56,008
Did you try to talk to him?
- Yes.

1304
02:21:56,010 --> 02:22:00,088
But he is not ready
to speak to anyone.

1305
02:22:00,088 --> 02:22:04,251
Call Yeshwant on the mobile.

1306
02:22:20,027 --> 02:22:23,356
Speak, Commissioner.
- Aditya,

1307
02:22:23,356 --> 02:22:26,311
Aditya, see, whatever you
are doing, is very wrong.

1308
02:22:26,311 --> 02:22:32,222
Listen to me. Release the three
right now and come down

1309
02:22:32,805 --> 02:22:35,677
I promise you, nothing
will happen to you.

1310
02:22:35,677 --> 02:22:38,676
Whatever had to happen
to me, has happened.

1311
02:22:38,676 --> 02:22:41,671
Now, it is their turn.
Till the time...

1312
02:22:41,671 --> 02:22:44,836
...they don't confess to the
crime of killing my brother...

1313
02:22:44,836 --> 02:22:46,874
...they will have to stay right here.

1314
02:22:46,875 --> 02:22:49,788
Don't be stupid, Aditya.
See, the court...

1315
02:22:49,790 --> 02:22:52,742
...has decided, and nobody
can do anything.

1316
02:22:52,745 --> 02:22:55,825
Whatever the court had heard
was half the truth.

1317
02:22:55,825 --> 02:22:58,737
I want to hear the whole
truth from their mouths.

1318
02:22:58,738 --> 02:23:02,734
Do you know, that you've been
surrounded by the police.

1319
02:23:02,734 --> 02:23:06,898
And if... - If any of your man
tries to come inside the...

1320
02:23:06,898 --> 02:23:13,016
...building, you will be responsible
for their death.

1321
02:23:17,802 --> 02:23:22,007
Child, I have trained Adit.

1322
02:23:22,007 --> 02:23:25,795
I know that till the time
the ACP and his colleagues...

1323
02:23:25,795 --> 02:23:29,124
...don't listen to what he says,
what about those three...

1324
02:23:29,124 --> 02:23:32,287
...even the whole police force
won't be able to harm him.

1325
02:23:32,287 --> 02:23:36,865
But Papa, why will those
three bow to him?

1326
02:23:36,865 --> 02:23:41,113
If a soldier wishes, he
can bow the enemy's flag.

1327
02:23:41,113 --> 02:23:45,025
And then, these are just
three police men.

1328
02:23:45,025 --> 02:23:50,769
Those police men, who
had killed his brother.

1329
02:23:50,769 --> 02:23:52,227
Write on this...

1330
02:23:52,227 --> 02:23:55,222
...that Anuj Shrivastav is innocent...

1331
02:23:55,222 --> 02:24:00,220
...and you killed him with
the help of these two.

1332
02:24:04,088 --> 02:24:07,338
You've gone crazy.
You've gone crazy.

1333
02:24:07,338 --> 02:24:11,665
Come, for a moment, let us assume
that I confess to my crime.

1334
02:24:11,790 --> 02:24:15,454
And I sign these documents.
What do you think?

1335
02:24:15,454 --> 02:24:18,283
I will be hanged? The whole
world knows that...

1336
02:24:18,284 --> 02:24:22,406
...you have tied us here, and
you have a gun in your hand.

1337
02:24:22,406 --> 02:24:27,484
Everybody will understand that
you've made us confess forcibly.

1338
02:24:34,100 --> 02:24:37,929
Stop ordering me, and
worry about yourself.

1339
02:24:37,929 --> 02:24:42,759
See, your fathers have
already arrived.

1340
02:24:52,831 --> 02:24:57,909
What are you doing? Yes?
What are you doing?

1341
02:25:36,331 --> 02:25:38,868
Hello!
- If such a mistake occurs again...

1342
02:25:38,870 --> 02:25:42,950
...then I will throw all these
three one by one, down.

1343
02:25:43,075 --> 02:25:44,654
Sir, he wishes to speak to you.

1344
02:25:44,656 --> 02:25:50,025
Aditya, don't cut the phone.
Someone wishes to speak to you.

1345
02:25:53,895 --> 02:25:55,891
Aditya, it's me. Payal.

1346
02:25:55,893 --> 02:26:00,931
Oh! So they are using
you as a weapon.

1347
02:26:01,056 --> 02:26:03,221
Aditya, I have come according
to own wishes.

1348
02:26:03,222 --> 02:26:07,758
Enough. I am fighting this war
to prove my brother's innocence.

1349
02:26:08,340 --> 02:26:13,212
And I will do it, even if
I have to give up my life...

1350
02:26:13,337 --> 02:26:17,499
...or whether I have to
kill someone for that.

1351
02:26:17,540 --> 02:26:20,286
Your beloved is smarter than you.

1352
02:26:20,287 --> 02:26:23,115
Listen to what she says, and
surrender to the police...

1353
02:26:23,117 --> 02:26:25,945
...raising both your
hands in the air.

1354
02:26:25,947 --> 02:26:28,444
Maybe, your life will be spared.

1355
02:26:28,445 --> 02:26:30,943
The people whom you
are meddling with.

1356
02:26:30,944 --> 02:26:33,939
They are of the Special Force.
To reach till you...

1357
02:26:33,939 --> 02:26:38,518
...they can even pave
a path from the sky.

1358
02:28:14,065 --> 02:28:16,979
Till the time you people don't
confess your crime...

1359
02:28:16,980 --> 02:28:20,268
...you police officers will
suffer the same fate.

1360
02:28:20,268 --> 02:28:23,097
Tell me! What is the truth?

1361
02:28:23,099 --> 02:28:27,344
What are you doing? If you kill
us, you won't be spared too.

1362
02:28:27,509 --> 02:28:32,258
I don't care about my life. But
you think for the last time.

1363
02:28:33,007 --> 02:28:36,086
Whether you will confess
your crime or not.

1364
02:28:36,086 --> 02:28:39,623
Hey, let me go!

1365
02:29:12,200 --> 02:29:13,779
Now, it's your turn.

1366
02:29:13,779 --> 02:29:16,109
I am not at fault, sir. That... that...

1367
02:29:16,112 --> 02:29:19,108
We just did as the
ACP told us to do.

1368
02:29:19,108 --> 02:29:23,104
We had roughed up your
brother too much.

1369
02:29:23,104 --> 02:29:27,266
He had died in the police
station itself.

1370
02:29:27,266 --> 02:29:29,639
Hey, what rubbish are you speaking
about? Are you crazy?

1371
02:29:29,640 --> 02:29:34,593
Let me speak, sir. Didn't
you see, he shot Yadav!

1372
02:29:34,593 --> 02:29:37,463
And then, and then the
ACP told the girl...

1373
02:29:37,463 --> 02:29:41,250
...to make him sit in the car
and take him with her.

1374
02:29:41,250 --> 02:29:44,207
We were following them
in another jeep.

1375
02:29:44,207 --> 02:29:47,622
And then, on his orders, he
staged a false encounter...

1376
02:29:47,622 --> 02:29:51,117
...and shot bullets at him. He
shot the bullets! He shot!

1377
02:29:51,117 --> 02:29:56,988
He was innocent! Yes He was
innocent! Yes! Can I go now?

1378
02:30:01,606 --> 02:30:03,519
Aditya I want meet you.

1379
02:30:03,520 --> 02:30:05,560
I don't want to meet
anyone at this time.

1380
02:30:05,561 --> 02:30:10,181
Aditya, please. I wish
to speak to you.

1381
02:30:10,181 --> 02:30:15,426
I wish to come close to you.
Please, just once.

1382
02:30:17,258 --> 02:30:22,793
Okay. I will send the lift down.

1383
02:30:27,373 --> 02:30:29,161
Sir.

1384
02:30:29,162 --> 02:30:33,615
Your work is done, Miss
Payal. Take madam.

1385
02:30:33,615 --> 02:30:37,195
What are you doing?
- Please.

1386
02:30:37,195 --> 02:30:41,859
You used me? You can't trick
Aditya. Commissioner.

1387
02:30:41,859 --> 02:30:46,436
Madam, please. Come.

1388
02:30:54,302 --> 02:30:59,800
See, please open me up. I will
tell the truth! Don't kill me.

1389
02:31:06,499 --> 02:31:10,329
I had killed him. I had
killed your brother.

1390
02:31:10,329 --> 02:31:14,784
So, so what will you do?
What will you do?

1391
02:31:14,784 --> 02:31:19,570
He used to speak too much. I
shut him up! I shut him up!

1392
02:31:19,570 --> 02:31:22,233
I hit him and took out his life.

1393
02:31:22,234 --> 02:31:24,231
Then I took him in the
middle of the road...

1394
02:31:24,231 --> 02:31:28,186
...and pumped bullets into
that wretch all over again.

1395
02:31:28,228 --> 02:31:30,559
But who will tell
that in the court?

1396
02:31:30,559 --> 02:31:34,390
We killed Mehmoodbhai.
You killed Yadav.

1397
02:31:34,390 --> 02:31:38,219
And then, this one is left!

1398
02:31:38,302 --> 02:31:39,508
Get aside.

1399
02:31:39,508 --> 02:31:44,505
Only you are left, I
will finish you off.

1400
02:33:06,338 --> 02:33:10,418
Sir, he has killed Yadav and
Sawant in front of me.

1401
02:33:10,418 --> 02:33:15,162
And he will kill me too. Shoot
him, sir! Shoot him!

1402
02:33:15,412 --> 02:33:17,034
I didn't kill anybody.

1403
02:33:17,034 --> 02:33:21,823
He is lying, sir. He has killed
Yadav and Sawant in front of me.

1404
02:33:22,031 --> 02:33:24,900
He is lying, sir!

1405
02:33:24,902 --> 02:33:30,814
Sir, just give me one minute.
I want to show you something.

1406
02:33:32,354 --> 02:33:36,641
Okay. Leave his hands.

1407
02:33:44,966 --> 02:33:50,627
I didn't kill Yadav. But he
killed Sawant in front of me.

1408
02:33:57,663 --> 02:34:01,409
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

1409
02:34:01,409 --> 02:34:03,738
If you kill us, even
you won't be spared.

1410
02:34:03,740 --> 02:34:06,402
I am not at fault, sir.
That... that...

1411
02:34:06,404 --> 02:34:08,567
We just did as the
ACP told us to do.

1412
02:34:08,568 --> 02:34:11,064
We had roughed up your
brother too much.

1413
02:34:11,065 --> 02:34:13,061
He had died in the police
station itself.

1414
02:34:13,063 --> 02:34:14,728
Hey, what rubbish are
you speaking about?

1415
02:34:14,729 --> 02:34:15,810
Have you gone crazy?

1416
02:34:15,811 --> 02:34:19,391
He shot the bullets! He shot!

1417
02:34:22,802 --> 02:34:27,550
I don't want to take the law
in my hands, Commissioner.

1418
02:34:27,550 --> 02:34:33,001
If I had to kill them, I could
have killed them long ago.

1419
02:34:34,042 --> 02:34:39,496
Whatever I have done, I did
it to prove Anuj innocent.

1420
02:34:40,784 --> 02:34:44,865
Anuj won't come back if these
people are punished.

1421
02:34:44,865 --> 02:34:47,694
But many innocents will be saved.

1422
02:34:47,695 --> 02:34:50,443
They will surely be punished
for their actions.

1423
02:34:50,444 --> 02:34:54,686
And you brother will
be proved innocent.

1424
02:34:54,686 --> 02:34:57,852
Take him away.
