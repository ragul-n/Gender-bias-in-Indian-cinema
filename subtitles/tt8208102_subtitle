1
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:22,968
Sridhar, I’ve been searching for you.

2
00:02:22,993 --> 00:02:24,988
Santhanam asked me to bring you 
immediately to meet him.

3
00:02:25,013 --> 00:02:26,427
Seems to be a new movie and 
a popular company.

4
00:02:26,452 --> 00:02:27,754
Hurry up & hop onto the vehicle.

5
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,368
What is this? I’m talking to you 
and you are lost in your thoughts?

6
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,127
I need to go to office.

7
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,690
For what? Do you need to meet anyone else?

8
00:02:35,452 --> 00:02:37,243
From now on, my work is in the office only.

9
00:02:37,494 --> 00:02:39,494
Sridhar what are you saying?

10
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:42,285
It’s my brother’s friend’s company.

11
00:02:42,577 --> 00:02:44,744
I get my salary on time 
at 1st of every month.

12
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:49,243
Previously music was my all time thought,

13
00:02:51,577 --> 00:02:53,577
now I wonder if i’d have 
time to even listen to it.

14
00:02:54,285 --> 00:02:59,202
This is not the right time for all 
the struggles, wait and trials.

15
00:03:02,035 --> 00:03:04,035
Hey dude, today also the same movie huh?

16
00:03:05,013 --> 00:03:06,764
It will be the same till 
I get a chance in cinema.

17
00:03:06,789 --> 00:03:08,959
For that only you went to chennai right. 
What happened?

18
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:15,063
Huh.. Producer told me to make 
an hour pilot film with my story.

19
00:03:15,514 --> 00:03:18,889
If I had the money to make it for an hour, 
why wouldn’t I do it for another hour too.

20
00:03:19,577 --> 00:03:21,035
These are just excuses man.

21
00:03:21,363 --> 00:03:23,155
You need to stay there in 
Chennai and search dude.

22
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,472
Only after that you will get the chance.

23
00:03:24,577 --> 00:03:25,535
Money?

24
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,660
My parents are already 
nagging me what I’m going

25
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,827
to do next since it’s 
already been 4 years.

26
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:34,202
Relatives know that I’m trying for movies,

27
00:03:34,243 --> 00:03:36,368
but then too they would 
call and say that their son

28
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:38,452
has gone for onsite, and 
ask me where I’m working?

29
00:03:38,494 --> 00:03:40,744
I don’t know what 
happiness they get in this.

30
00:03:40,948 --> 00:03:42,198
That is also fine.

31
00:03:42,832 --> 00:03:44,665
But someone told me she 
will be with me forever.

32
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,690
Now, she has given me 
a deadline of 3 months.

33
00:03:47,048 --> 00:03:48,590
If I don’t come up with 
any films till then she’d

34
00:03:48,619 --> 00:03:49,993
be getting married to 
someone else it seems.

35
00:03:50,035 --> 00:03:51,494
I just left her.

36
00:03:51,494 --> 00:03:55,535
Am I a substitute for her? Only 
we know what we are going through.

37
00:03:55,785 --> 00:03:57,702
Dude since you are saying 
you are struggling,

38
00:03:58,368 --> 00:04:02,410
I’d suggest you a producer who I know. 
But his budget is very low.

39
00:04:02,494 --> 00:04:02,993
How much?

40
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,202
10 rupees man

41
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,327
Hey my budget is only 1 yaar.

42
00:04:06,368 --> 00:04:08,494
Oye 10 rupees means 10 lakhs.

43
00:04:08,535 --> 00:04:11,410
Hmm mmm. Can’t do anything 
with this 10 lakhs.

44
00:04:13,202 --> 00:04:15,911
Look! Since you said 
it’s hard, I suggested.

45
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,076
It’s not like it is impossible. 
You can do it.

46
00:04:18,118 --> 00:04:20,327
So far no one has tried, but we can.

47
00:04:20,619 --> 00:04:22,952
If you trust me call me.

48
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,368
bye

49
00:04:33,327 --> 00:04:35,494
Sir, I previously told you 
about a guy right. He’s the one.

50
00:04:35,827 --> 00:04:37,911
Oh. 10 lakhs is the budget. 
Have you told him?

51
00:04:38,035 --> 00:04:39,660
Haan. Told sir.

52
00:04:39,952 --> 00:04:41,952
Ok bro. Tell me your story. 
Let’s not waste time

53
00:04:41,993 --> 00:04:45,577
Hmmm sir... First the opening scene,

54
00:05:01,717 --> 00:05:05,217
Human race came into existence 
2 lakhs years before.

55
00:05:05,613 --> 00:05:08,030
From the time where he roamed 
around, naked in the sun to this time

56
00:05:08,535 --> 00:05:11,702
where he has settled with air conditioners,

57
00:05:12,285 --> 00:05:14,577
he has gone through various modifications.

58
00:05:15,368 --> 00:05:19,327
But if we reveal the harsh truth that 
God has offered him a precious thing

59
00:05:20,498 --> 00:05:22,164
which has traveled with him 
all through these years,

60
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:28,856
through rains, storms and 
floods,they find it hard to believe.

61
00:05:29,619 --> 00:05:32,952
The troops which are 
guarding those treasures

62
00:05:32,952 --> 00:05:34,952
have also gone through 
various transformations.

63
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,952
For the past 20 thousand 
years the organisation

64
00:05:37,952 --> 00:05:40,452
that has kept the treasure 
under its control is known as the

65
00:05:41,494 --> 00:05:43,911
“Zhagaram”, a tamizhan organisation.

66
00:05:44,619 --> 00:05:46,785
When we take a closer look at our history,

67
00:05:47,522 --> 00:05:50,438
we can see that whenever we are 
at the peak of our distress,

68
00:05:50,995 --> 00:05:52,744
this treasure had resurged,

69
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,660
performing its duties.

70
00:05:58,285 --> 00:06:02,285
But If anyone tries to possess 
this precious treasure,

71
00:06:02,869 --> 00:06:06,285
their lives would be ended 
by the zhagaram organisation.

72
00:06:06,702 --> 00:06:09,702
Even now the hunt of zhagaram is still on

73
00:07:56,744 --> 00:07:58,577
Hello boss I have killed the target

74
00:07:58,619 --> 00:08:00,076
But, there is nothing as you said

75
00:08:00,118 --> 00:08:02,952
Okay you leave now I will take care

76
00:11:36,118 --> 00:11:37,577
Hello, srinivasan sir?

77
00:11:37,619 --> 00:11:39,160
Bro, how are you?

78
00:11:39,327 --> 00:11:40,035
I’m good sir.

79
00:11:40,076 --> 00:11:45,202
There’s a senior agent post available 
in our company. Do you know? ah yes sir

80
00:11:45,619 --> 00:11:47,619
For that, I have recommended you.

81
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,869
Thank you sir, thank you sir

82
00:11:48,911 --> 00:11:50,118
It’s all due to your hard work.

83
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,076
Sir it’s because of your blessings too.

84
00:11:54,776 --> 00:11:57,068
It will always be with you bro.

85
00:11:57,202 --> 00:11:57,577
Thank you sir, thank you sir.

86
00:11:57,577 --> 00:12:02,494
If you get promotion, you 
need to resign your job.

87
00:12:03,952 --> 00:12:04,827
Take care.

88
00:12:04,869 --> 00:12:07,368
This is a 50,000 salary job.

89
00:12:08,577 --> 00:12:11,577
If there is a delay in joining 
it will go to someone else.

90
00:12:12,827 --> 00:12:16,827
Sir, i’ll resign the job 
the next moment it is done.

91
00:12:17,785 --> 00:12:19,785
Take care. Bye

92
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:34,535
What is this? You are 
coming early as usual?

93
00:12:35,076 --> 00:12:37,076
I’ve come right. That’s enough.

94
00:12:41,285 --> 00:12:43,285
Hey boss is calling you.

95
00:12:43,952 --> 00:12:45,952
Hmmm.. Ask

96
00:12:47,702 --> 00:12:51,911
Hmmm boss..... I came early itself boss...

97
00:12:53,869 --> 00:12:55,869
Ohh.. You saw the CCTV huh?

98
00:12:56,952 --> 00:13:00,118
I should come to your room now na? Ok boss.

99
00:13:00,702 --> 00:13:02,660
Go go.. enjoy.

100
00:13:03,035 --> 00:13:05,035
Hey he won’t spare me yaa.

101
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:07,577
Oh God, what’s gonna happen.

102
00:13:10,702 --> 00:13:11,702
Sit down.

103
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,160
What to do if you are 
late everyday like this?

104
00:13:17,785 --> 00:13:18,785
Boss.... that,...

105
00:13:18,827 --> 00:13:20,827
Look don’t interrupt while I’m talking.

106
00:13:20,827 --> 00:13:22,827
Boss.. For that you can talk alone.

107
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:25,827
What? Wait wait wait...

108
00:13:26,577 --> 00:13:32,494
Hello.. huh tell me.. Okay.. okay.. 
Hmmm.

109
00:13:38,035 --> 00:13:38,869
What is this..

110
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,869
Srinivasan sir’s message has come...

111
00:13:45,911 --> 00:13:47,911
message has come...

112
00:13:49,076 --> 00:13:52,993
“Congrats you are promoted 
as a senior agent”

113
00:13:58,076 --> 00:14:00,076
Hmm okay.. okay..

114
00:14:04,494 --> 00:14:05,869
What did you say? Tell me again.

115
00:14:06,118 --> 00:14:09,744
If I shouldn’t interrupt you while 
talking, you can talk to yourself right.

116
00:14:10,394 --> 00:14:12,537
Why are you troubling us?

117
00:14:13,911 --> 00:14:16,118
I don’t like this company. I’m resigning.

118
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:40,076
Sir, tell me.. Just now I saw your message.

119
00:14:40,577 --> 00:14:42,327
I’m coming to join.

120
00:14:42,494 --> 00:14:45,744
Whaaattt!! Message has 
been sent wrongly huh?

121
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:47,368
what wrong message ah?

122
00:14:47,494 --> 00:14:49,619
ok bro you will have more work, carry on.

123
00:14:49,619 --> 00:14:51,285
Which work?

124
00:14:54,619 --> 00:14:57,911
Hmmm.. My bad luck.. lost this one too.

125
00:14:58,076 --> 00:15:00,076
Looks like i need to 
earn making pakoras only.

126
00:15:01,035 --> 00:15:04,368
No, I’m a decent man. Begging 
is also a job it seems.

127
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,952
Hello.. Who’s this?

128
00:15:16,285 --> 00:15:17,410
Please wait I’ll come.

129
00:15:32,952 --> 00:15:33,452
Akhil?

130
00:15:37,827 --> 00:15:38,619
Huh tell me..

131
00:15:38,619 --> 00:15:39,911
My name’s sivagynanam.

132
00:15:40,202 --> 00:15:44,410
I’ve come along with Rajan to your 
home many times when you were young.

133
00:15:44,435 --> 00:15:45,434
Is it

134
00:15:45,459 --> 00:15:47,128
Your dad was abroad.

135
00:15:48,911 --> 00:15:51,660
It’s been 20 years. Now 
everything has changed.

136
00:15:54,118 --> 00:15:56,952
I heard Rajan passed away.

137
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,952
Yeah uncle. He was fine only.

138
00:16:00,744 --> 00:16:02,243
He didn’t go out too for the past 2 months.

139
00:16:02,827 --> 00:16:06,035
That afternoon also he was in the 
library only. Don’t know what happened.

140
00:16:06,076 --> 00:16:08,327
It was a sudden heart attack.

141
00:16:08,827 --> 00:16:12,076
Library is his life and he 
lost his life there only.

142
00:16:13,337 --> 00:16:17,494
When you saw him for the last time, 
did he say any details to you?

143
00:16:20,243 --> 00:16:21,118
Regarding what?

144
00:16:21,368 --> 00:16:24,660
Regarding the burnt paper?

145
00:16:26,911 --> 00:16:27,619
What do you mean?

146
00:16:27,827 --> 00:16:32,368
Did he give any parcel to 
you, asking to keep it safe?

147
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:37,452
Sir, what is this? You have been talking 
irrelevant things. What do you want?

148
00:16:38,243 --> 00:16:40,952
Cool bro. Listen to me carefully.

149
00:16:41,785 --> 00:16:44,202
Your grandfather was murdered.

150
00:16:44,785 --> 00:16:48,327
It’s all because of those burnt 
secrets of the yazhpanam library.

151
00:16:48,494 --> 00:16:51,952
I’ve come here to help you. 
Please tell me the truth

152
00:16:52,035 --> 00:16:55,660
Sir, my grandfather was delared innocent by 
the court in that yazhpanam library case.

153
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,076
Why are you creating new stories? 
First leave from here.

154
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,368
Shhh... Don’t shout. There 
are many people here.

155
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:02,993
Someone might hear.

156
00:17:05,035 --> 00:17:07,368
Here this is my card.

157
00:17:07,785 --> 00:17:11,076
If you need any help, call me. 
I’ll rush immediately.

158
00:17:29,911 --> 00:17:31,535
Your grandfather was murdered..

159
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:35,660
Did he say anything about the burnt papers?

160
00:17:36,452 --> 00:17:38,785
There are many who are 
waiting to kill you too.

161
00:17:39,452 --> 00:17:41,076
It’s all for that secret.

162
00:18:24,384 --> 00:18:26,301
Doctor, there’s nothing to worry right?

163
00:18:26,342 --> 00:18:30,342
No no.. It’s just minor scratches. 
You will be alright after taking rest.

164
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:31,509
Okay.. okay..

165
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:42,201
Mom.. mom.. It’s nothing mom.. 
I’ll be alright..

166
00:18:42,226 --> 00:18:46,518
Mom.. It’s nothing to worry.. okay? 
He’s perfectly alright.

167
00:18:46,964 --> 00:18:48,217
He will be discharged in the evening.

168
00:18:48,592 --> 00:18:49,634
Thank you doctor.

169
00:18:49,676 --> 00:18:51,676
Okay akhil.. Take care..

170
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,134
Mom, I was driving safe & slow.

171
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:57,759
The guy who came in the 
opposite direction hit me.

172
00:18:58,718 --> 00:19:01,718
Hmmm.. After that I don’t remember 
anything. did you find who hit me.

173
00:19:02,092 --> 00:19:04,092
Police is enquiring about this.

174
00:19:04,718 --> 00:19:07,467
But since its a remote area, 
they say it’s hard to find.

175
00:19:07,883 --> 00:19:10,426
Some good hearted fellow 
had called the ambulance.

176
00:19:10,676 --> 00:19:12,259
Not sure who that is too.

177
00:19:21,634 --> 00:19:24,967
History, ancient myths & mythologies..

178
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:29,676
hmmm...Why are we reading histories?

179
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:35,384
History has left behind 
many hidden truths for us.

180
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:41,718
Now the vel which you are 
seeing symbolises our knowledge.

181
00:19:42,509 --> 00:19:45,134
Our knowledge should be 
sharp, wide and deep.

182
00:19:45,634 --> 00:19:48,718
We all know about Leonardo Da 
Vinci’s Monalisa painting right?

183
00:19:49,592 --> 00:19:52,551
During those times when paintings 
were only on kings and queens,

184
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:56,592
Da Vinci called a simple girl to 
pose as a model and painted her.

185
00:19:57,718 --> 00:20:02,301
Now it is just a simple 
example of an ancient lady.

186
00:20:03,355 --> 00:20:08,396
Everyone loves to see their name in 
history but history chooses only few.

187
00:20:08,676 --> 00:20:11,509
If you need to mark your place in 
history, you need to read it first.

188
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:14,342
Haan.. Now everyone turn 
to chapter 4 in your books.

189
00:20:20,384 --> 00:20:21,301
Come carefully..

190
00:20:48,384 --> 00:20:50,384
hmm.. Sit sit.. hmm okay..

191
00:20:51,676 --> 00:20:54,259
Careful.. slow..

192
00:20:55,259 --> 00:20:56,551
Just a minute I’ll come.

193
00:20:56,592 --> 00:20:57,509
Wait Dad.

194
00:20:57,551 --> 00:20:59,175
Wait.. Just a minute.. I’ll come..

195
00:21:19,134 --> 00:21:20,259
Happy birthday Akhil.

196
00:21:20,301 --> 00:21:21,759
What is this new habit of 
presenting me gifts dad?

197
00:21:22,592 --> 00:21:25,092
Your grandfather wanted 
me to give this to you.

198
00:21:25,509 --> 00:21:28,592
His last wish was to see you, 
atleast once before his death.

199
00:21:28,676 --> 00:21:29,384
It’s alright.. Leave..

200
00:21:30,426 --> 00:21:32,426
He told me to give this on your birthday.

201
00:21:33,967 --> 00:21:35,967
Hmm Thanks dad

202
00:21:37,384 --> 00:21:41,676
Okay.. You take rest. I’ve some work. 
I’ll come in a while.

203
00:22:19,509 --> 00:22:22,718
Akhil.. I know how much you love me..

204
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:25,842
But I’m not as innocent as you think.

205
00:22:26,175 --> 00:22:29,134
I’ve been traveling in search of 
a treasure for the past 20 years.

206
00:22:29,467 --> 00:22:31,676
There are many dangers around me.

207
00:22:31,842 --> 00:22:33,842
You need to do one thing for me, akhil.

208
00:22:34,092 --> 00:22:38,634
I’ve hidden the secrets about 
this treasure in a place.

209
00:22:39,009 --> 00:22:42,759
If those secrets are exposed 
people will easily get hold of it.

210
00:22:42,883 --> 00:22:45,342
So, please destroy those clues.

211
00:22:45,509 --> 00:22:48,426
And please don’t go in 
search of that treasure.

212
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:53,175
I’m not sure if I’ll be alive 
when you are reading this letter

213
00:22:53,967 --> 00:22:57,175
but please do this for me as my last wish.

214
00:23:38,342 --> 00:23:38,967
Hello?

215
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:41,967
What brother.. have the 
guys made you wait for long?

216
00:23:43,426 --> 00:23:44,634
Hello? who are you?

217
00:23:45,426 --> 00:23:48,467
What is this akhil? How can 
you end this now itself.

218
00:23:48,925 --> 00:23:50,467
The game has just begun.

219
00:23:50,467 --> 00:23:52,175
Hello!? who are you?

220
00:23:52,634 --> 00:23:54,301
Those things are not needed for you.

221
00:23:54,676 --> 00:23:56,301
Just listen to what I’ve got to say.

222
00:23:56,759 --> 00:23:58,175
I read that letter too.

223
00:23:58,759 --> 00:24:02,551
You are not gonna do what your grandfather 
has told you but what I’m gonna tell you.

224
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:07,467
Before Chitirai 22nd i.e May 
5th i need that treasure.

225
00:24:07,606 --> 00:24:09,606
Who are you man? Who are 
you to order me on phone?

226
00:24:09,925 --> 00:24:10,967
Stop. Don’t shout.

227
00:24:11,467 --> 00:24:12,342
See its sweating for you.

228
00:24:13,925 --> 00:24:15,925
There’s water near you, drink it.

229
00:24:27,426 --> 00:24:28,092
Hello..

230
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:30,092
What? Are you searching for any cameras?

231
00:24:30,967 --> 00:24:33,467
Dont worry. Just remember one thing,

232
00:24:35,009 --> 00:24:37,676
today’s accident is just a sample.

233
00:24:40,092 --> 00:24:43,050
I’m not like those movie villians who 
call you frequently to threaten you.

234
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:47,009
Akhil, I’ll get to know 
even if you sneeze or cough.

235
00:24:49,259 --> 00:24:53,718
So act wisely. Or else, 
I wont wait till may month..

236
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:58,009
Your dad is buying tomatoes from the shop, 
your mother is frying Rasam in the kitchen.

237
00:24:58,467 --> 00:25:01,676
Hope you have understood. 
So, let’s meet on May 5th.

238
00:25:16,883 --> 00:25:21,092
How is that posssible dude? He 
even told about the water bottle.

239
00:25:21,467 --> 00:25:22,883
It’s all simple yaar.

240
00:25:23,009 --> 00:25:24,842
When everyone sleeps, they 
would be having water near them.

241
00:25:24,967 --> 00:25:26,301
He would have spoken in fright.

242
00:25:26,384 --> 00:25:28,175
By that he would have 
have said he was sweating.

243
00:25:28,342 --> 00:25:29,759
Mom means she will be kitchen only.

244
00:25:29,883 --> 00:25:31,634
He would have seen when dad went out.

245
00:25:31,842 --> 00:25:34,259
How many english movies we would 
have watched. This is just so simple.

246
00:25:34,634 --> 00:25:36,634
Okay.. What did your grandfather 
write in that letter?

247
00:25:39,092 --> 00:25:40,718
If people come to know about the treasure,

248
00:25:41,342 --> 00:25:43,134
they will fight with 
each other to possess it.

249
00:25:43,551 --> 00:25:47,301
Finally the human race will become extinct.

250
00:25:49,342 --> 00:25:50,718
Then this is not a simple issue.

251
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:54,599
Hey where is that dice?

252
00:26:04,925 --> 00:26:06,384
What would this be?

253
00:26:06,925 --> 00:26:09,634
Hey he’s so eager than you.

254
00:26:10,217 --> 00:26:13,009
Arrey he’s got into some major trouble.

255
00:26:13,995 --> 00:26:17,037
he made this accident to show his power.

256
00:26:17,426 --> 00:26:18,842
Ask him to call now.

257
00:26:18,842 --> 00:26:20,467
Hey shut up. I’m scared.

258
00:26:20,509 --> 00:26:22,718
What is this man. You are 
getting scared for these things.

259
00:26:22,925 --> 00:26:25,842
If he calls you again, dude 
that would be his last call.

260
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:27,676
Dude, when he calls 
forward his call to me.

261
00:26:27,676 --> 00:26:28,634
Who is he playing with.

262
00:26:30,467 --> 00:26:32,467
Hey it’s him.

263
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:36,384
OMG! 
Hey hey hey don’t attend.

264
00:26:36,634 --> 00:26:37,551
If you attend only you will get in trouble.

265
00:26:37,592 --> 00:26:38,759
Look now you made him call.

266
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,009
What did I do?

267
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:40,883
What you didn’t do?

268
00:26:40,883 --> 00:26:42,092
Hey shut up.

269
00:26:43,925 --> 00:26:44,718
Let’s see what he says.

270
00:26:45,342 --> 00:26:46,134
Hmm okay

271
00:26:50,259 --> 00:26:53,551
What Akhil, looks like you are 
discussing about the treasure.

272
00:26:57,509 --> 00:26:59,509
Hmm why all are silent?

273
00:27:00,092 --> 00:27:01,551
Why are you three blinking hard?

274
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,634
Hey Surya, atleast you can talk right.

275
00:27:04,426 --> 00:27:07,301
What are you looking at? You are 
the one with black T-shirt right?

276
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:10,050
And that yellow t-shirt is our Sudharshan.

277
00:27:10,676 --> 00:27:11,718
Am I right?

278
00:27:12,175 --> 00:27:13,009
where is he?

279
00:27:13,092 --> 00:27:14,050
Whom are you searching for?

280
00:27:14,426 --> 00:27:15,467
You only asked me right?

281
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,384
See, I’ve called you.now talk

282
00:27:22,175 --> 00:27:26,175
Haha.. Intentionally or unintentionally 
you yourselves got into the trouble.

283
00:27:26,676 --> 00:27:27,842
I just need the treasure.

284
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:30,967
Give that to me and you are free to leave.

285
00:27:31,718 --> 00:27:34,301
Dont think too much. You 
have only 2 weeks time.

286
00:27:34,883 --> 00:27:36,509
I need that before that.

287
00:27:37,175 --> 00:27:38,925
Or else I can guarantee your lives.

288
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:43,259
What are you thinking surya?

289
00:27:44,009 --> 00:27:45,301
You are jobless right?

290
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:51,342
For safer side, save an 
insurance policy for you.

291
00:27:52,342 --> 00:27:54,342
Understand and behave.

292
00:27:57,426 --> 00:27:58,217
What is this yaar?

293
00:27:58,509 --> 00:27:59,925
Do something man.

294
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:02,384
Akhil, what are you thinking?

295
00:28:03,925 --> 00:28:06,175
Not sure. We don’t have any other go.

296
00:28:08,301 --> 00:28:09,134
We don’t know who he is.

297
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,009
how did my grand father died.

298
00:28:12,342 --> 00:28:13,426
What is that treasure?

299
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:15,259
Who is that sivagnyanam?

300
00:28:15,634 --> 00:28:18,384
We can find the answers 
only we find that treasure.

301
00:28:20,342 --> 00:28:24,092
Yeah. Right. But where do we start?

302
00:28:24,551 --> 00:28:26,551
We dont know anything about that dice na?

303
00:28:28,092 --> 00:28:30,883
I think it will be better if we 
have an archaeologist with us.

304
00:28:31,883 --> 00:28:34,259
You know one archeologist right?

305
00:28:35,266 --> 00:28:35,932
Who?

306
00:28:36,883 --> 00:28:37,634
Sneha

307
00:28:53,809 --> 00:28:58,678
without seeing you, I’ve gone crazy

308
00:28:59,057 --> 00:29:03,877
after seeing you, I’m speechless

309
00:29:04,821 --> 00:29:07,178
The tunes of the monsoon

310
00:29:07,507 --> 00:29:09,811
the waves of the hand

311
00:29:09,985 --> 00:29:11,938
the blinding beauty

312
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:15,140
You are all in one

313
00:29:15,316 --> 00:29:17,725
the flag at top of the roof

314
00:29:18,067 --> 00:29:20,000
the bell at top of the temple

315
00:29:20,764 --> 00:29:23,058
the dewdrops on the rock

316
00:29:23,217 --> 00:29:25,185
You are all in one

317
00:29:25,739 --> 00:29:27,672
Like the eyes expressing love

318
00:29:28,386 --> 00:29:30,586
Like the rain that sprinkles love

319
00:29:31,121 --> 00:29:33,921
Like the first line of calendar being love

320
00:29:34,183 --> 00:29:36,304
Will you live for me?

321
00:29:36,429 --> 00:29:38,962
Like Love is the moonlight in the dark

322
00:29:39,164 --> 00:29:41,764
Like Love is the laughter and the smile

323
00:29:41,789 --> 00:29:44,389
Like Love is the sand touching our foot

324
00:29:44,458 --> 00:29:45,725
You are born for me

325
00:29:47,211 --> 00:29:51,951
without seeing you, I’ve gone crazy

326
00:29:52,389 --> 00:29:57,854
after seeing you, I’m speechless

327
00:30:29,831 --> 00:30:35,229
My eyes are full of love

328
00:30:38,809 --> 00:30:40,403
Oh oh oh

329
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:45,684
My eyes are full of love

330
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:50,433
Speak for awhiile without any pause.

331
00:30:51,036 --> 00:30:56,058
When the wind blows, the doors will open

332
00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:01,749
Like the fingerprints let’s stay in love

333
00:31:01,804 --> 00:31:03,819
With the music of the wind

334
00:31:04,139 --> 00:31:06,733
Love becomes the song

335
00:31:06,974 --> 00:31:08,908
Like the eyes expressing love

336
00:31:09,717 --> 00:31:11,917
Like the rain that sprinkles love

337
00:31:12,439 --> 00:31:14,963
Like the first line of calendar being love

338
00:31:15,085 --> 00:31:16,552
Will you live for me?

339
00:31:33,716 --> 00:31:38,425
My love turns hot when alone

340
00:31:44,525 --> 00:31:49,438
My love turns hot when alone

341
00:31:49,521 --> 00:31:54,814
My thirst satisfies, if you are the rain

342
00:31:55,047 --> 00:32:00,281
When you walk on the road

343
00:32:00,446 --> 00:32:03,375
Like the blossoming garden flowers

344
00:32:03,469 --> 00:32:05,461
My heart blossoms.

345
00:32:05,711 --> 00:32:07,511
Eyes have taken their place

346
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:10,872
On the chair of love.

347
00:32:16,525 --> 00:32:21,274
I’ve gone crazy without seeing you

348
00:32:21,728 --> 00:32:27,128
I’ve become dumbfounded after seeing you

349
00:32:27,636 --> 00:32:29,236
the tunes of the monsoon

350
00:32:30,022 --> 00:32:32,487
the waves of the hand

351
00:32:32,549 --> 00:32:34,839
the blinding beauty

352
00:32:35,013 --> 00:32:37,685
You are all in one

353
00:32:38,029 --> 00:32:40,357
the flag atop the roof

354
00:32:40,763 --> 00:32:43,138
the bell atop the temple

355
00:32:43,401 --> 00:32:45,001
the dewdrops on the rock

356
00:32:45,645 --> 00:32:48,236
You are all in one

357
00:33:00,634 --> 00:33:04,509
By the way you talk it doesn’t look like 
you are searching groom for your daughter,

358
00:33:04,759 --> 00:33:07,883
but a good son-in-law 
according to your status.

359
00:33:08,426 --> 00:33:09,384
Thank you so much.

360
00:33:10,634 --> 00:33:11,175
Akhil..

361
00:33:12,175 --> 00:33:13,175
Akhil wait please

362
00:33:14,301 --> 00:33:17,050
Dad, I won’t marry anyone 
else other than Akhil

363
00:33:17,259 --> 00:33:19,259
and that will happen only 
after your acceptance.

364
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,800
Hmm.. What mistake did i do?

365
00:33:37,009 --> 00:33:38,925
Hey who asked her to come here?

366
00:33:38,967 --> 00:33:41,175
Oye by the way you look at me, it 
seems that you are telling me that

367
00:33:41,217 --> 00:33:43,384
I’ve shared the location to her 
via whatsapp and asked her to come.

368
00:33:43,925 --> 00:33:45,134
I know everything Akhil.

369
00:33:45,134 --> 00:33:46,676
Surya has told me everything.

370
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:49,759
Surya, i don’t need anyones help.

371
00:33:49,842 --> 00:33:51,342
Ask her to leave first.

372
00:33:51,592 --> 00:33:52,676
I wont leave surya

373
00:33:53,509 --> 00:33:54,759
He will say like this only.

374
00:33:55,842 --> 00:33:56,925
Here take a look at this.

375
00:34:00,023 --> 00:34:03,224
This is dice. Using this 
we used to play games

376
00:34:03,384 --> 00:34:06,634
like business, snake & 
ladder, aadu puli aattam.

377
00:34:07,259 --> 00:34:09,551
What did you say? Business huh?

378
00:34:09,592 --> 00:34:10,592
Yeah.

379
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:18,217
Hey, my grandpa gifted me a 
business board on my 10th birthday.

380
00:34:19,271 --> 00:34:21,521
See, this is why I told you 
we need an archeaologist.

381
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:23,426
Hmm mmm.. Why archeaologist for this?

382
00:34:23,467 --> 00:34:24,551
We could decode that oursleves.

383
00:34:26,342 --> 00:34:28,718
Hmm.. where is that business board now?

384
00:35:16,342 --> 00:35:18,967
Actually we need two dice for this.

385
00:35:19,498 --> 00:35:20,998
But we have only one.

386
00:35:21,759 --> 00:35:22,426
Give that.

387
00:35:24,592 --> 00:35:27,676
And when we take a look at 
this, only one side has 8 dots.

388
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:29,967
The other sides are blank.

389
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:32,718
Let’s do something.

390
00:35:33,134 --> 00:35:35,134
Search which place comes in the 8th place.

391
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:38,592
Totally there are four sides. Where to 
go and look for the 8th place in this?

392
00:35:38,925 --> 00:35:40,134
From the starting point.

393
00:35:40,967 --> 00:35:46,634
Okay.. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...

394
00:35:47,467 --> 00:35:48,050
Vizag..

395
00:35:49,587 --> 00:35:50,587
Why did vyzag come?

396
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:54,842
What is this dude, without any 
relevance vishakapatnam has come?

397
00:35:56,134 --> 00:35:58,050
No man. There is a relation.

398
00:35:58,301 --> 00:36:01,134
Before 2 years, my grandpa 
worked in vizag only.

399
00:36:02,759 --> 00:36:06,217
So, wee need to go to vishakapatnam now.

400
00:36:07,342 --> 00:36:10,175
Hey vishakapatnam is such a huge place.

401
00:36:10,842 --> 00:36:12,467
Where will go and search there?

402
00:36:12,842 --> 00:36:16,467
Our grandpa is an archeaologist 
right, we can go and enquire there.

403
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,467
Okay. We will go and enquire there.

404
00:36:21,342 --> 00:36:23,050
Oh, so are we going to vizag?

405
00:36:23,592 --> 00:36:25,592
Surya only we three are going.

406
00:36:25,668 --> 00:36:26,876
Surya, even I’ll come.

407
00:36:28,342 --> 00:36:30,342
Tell her Surya that we 
can’t take her till vizag.

408
00:36:30,467 --> 00:36:32,217
Tell him that I’ll take care of that surya.

409
00:36:32,466 --> 00:36:34,466
Please tell her to understand man.

410
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:36,842
He will tell like that only. 
I’ll book tickets for you too.

411
00:36:36,967 --> 00:36:38,009
Yaayy okay.

412
00:36:57,634 --> 00:36:58,967
To which place are you going first?

413
00:37:01,426 --> 00:37:05,384
Arakku valley, 
Bora caves, and museum.

414
00:37:05,676 --> 00:37:06,967
These are the must see places.

415
00:37:07,384 --> 00:37:08,676
Oooh.. Okay

416
00:37:17,473 --> 00:37:18,847
Hey look at this.

417
00:37:22,301 --> 00:37:23,134
What is there in this?

418
00:37:24,259 --> 00:37:26,676
Look at the first letter of this coin.

419
00:37:28,175 --> 00:37:29,551
Looks similiar to the one in our clue.

420
00:37:30,634 --> 00:37:31,426
Yeah dude.

421
00:37:32,537 --> 00:37:35,370
These are greek letters. Look at this.. 
these letters..

422
00:37:35,454 --> 00:37:37,162
Hey these are Roman letters.

423
00:37:37,426 --> 00:37:38,592
How are you these are roman?

424
00:37:38,592 --> 00:37:41,050
This is neither capital nor lower 
case letters. Roman letters.

425
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:42,259
Arrey yaar.. 
What?

426
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:44,134
Hey hey hey you guys 
were with me only right.

427
00:37:44,134 --> 00:37:45,759
When did you visit Greek and Roman.

428
00:37:46,386 --> 00:37:49,552
These are the tamil letters which were 
used during our ancient Tamil ruler Cheran.

429
00:37:49,925 --> 00:37:50,883
Oh this is tamil eh?

430
00:37:51,467 --> 00:37:52,967
This is Chinese or Arabic.

431
00:37:53,175 --> 00:37:54,259
This is our Tamil letter.

432
00:37:54,634 --> 00:37:55,800
Ancient Tamil.

433
00:37:56,883 --> 00:37:57,883
This is tamil man..

434
00:37:57,925 --> 00:37:59,050
Thats what he told na.

435
00:37:59,217 --> 00:38:00,342
Hmm okay.

436
00:38:00,967 --> 00:38:03,718
In our clue this is our first letter.

437
00:38:04,509 --> 00:38:05,592
There are three more letters na?

438
00:38:06,301 --> 00:38:06,800
mmm..

439
00:38:08,009 --> 00:38:10,009
haan. We have our Google Pichai.

440
00:38:10,009 --> 00:38:11,217
Look look.

441
00:38:27,592 --> 00:38:28,301
Tell me

442
00:38:29,676 --> 00:38:34,050
Aa, uu, AA,

443
00:38:34,925 --> 00:38:37,925
AA..AA..that all

444
00:38:38,842 --> 00:38:40,842
Aa, uu, AA....

445
00:38:41,467 --> 00:38:42,175
Give that.

446
00:38:46,509 --> 00:38:48,967
Hmm.. Does Om denote Lord Murugan?

447
00:38:49,551 --> 00:38:52,967
Why? It can be like this too right.. 
Om Ganapathy namaha.

448
00:38:54,384 --> 00:38:55,718
Then aa means?

449
00:38:56,509 --> 00:38:58,509
It can mean aalamaram.

450
00:38:59,486 --> 00:39:01,486
Hmm.. maybe.

451
00:39:01,925 --> 00:39:05,217
Can you think anything the 
letters which are below?

452
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:11,342
But, there is a circle 
surrounding all the hints.

453
00:39:11,883 --> 00:39:14,384
Have they put this simply 
or do they have any meaning?

454
00:39:14,759 --> 00:39:17,467
Leave. We are gonna go there 
na, we will get some clue.

455
00:39:17,676 --> 00:39:19,009
Where are we going first?

456
00:39:19,368 --> 00:39:21,076
Hey we are going to the museum first,

457
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:23,650
then Bora caves from 
there and then arakku.

458
00:40:06,163 --> 00:40:08,163
Akhil, sneha has sent a message.

459
00:40:08,278 --> 00:40:09,995
She’s there in the museum it seems.

460
00:40:10,776 --> 00:40:11,776
Where are we going next?

461
00:40:12,961 --> 00:40:14,003
Arakku valley..

462
00:40:15,409 --> 00:40:16,576
What are we going to do there?

463
00:40:16,633 --> 00:40:19,467
Now only we started right. 
Are you tired so fast?

464
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:23,425
No man. what are we going to ask there? 
And To whom?

465
00:40:23,873 --> 00:40:25,873
First we will go and look there.

466
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,981
Okay. Can we order a tea?

467
00:40:28,164 --> 00:40:28,873
For me milk.

468
00:40:31,231 --> 00:40:32,231
I have a doubt.

469
00:40:32,485 --> 00:40:32,860
What?

470
00:40:32,885 --> 00:40:34,677
Why has your grandpa 
giving such hard clues?

471
00:40:34,852 --> 00:40:36,644
He could have just mentioned 
the name of the place.

472
00:40:37,399 --> 00:40:41,232
That’s what he told us right. Not 
to go in search of that treasure.

473
00:40:44,576 --> 00:40:45,119
Thanks.

474
00:40:45,158 --> 00:40:46,170
Here milk for you.

475
00:40:52,764 --> 00:40:54,389
aa.. uu...

476
00:40:56,611 --> 00:40:57,934
don’t know what it exactly means.

477
00:41:00,076 --> 00:41:01,250
aa.. it can be cow too na?

478
00:41:01,275 --> 00:41:03,016
There is aavin milk 
shop in our place right?

479
00:41:03,041 --> 00:41:08,624
Then we have to look which 
place gives importance to cows.

480
00:41:11,074 --> 00:41:13,074
Lets us ask someone, you have tea

481
00:41:15,275 --> 00:41:16,358
What are you doing Google.

482
00:41:17,674 --> 00:41:18,682
Bora caves.

483
00:41:18,754 --> 00:41:21,545
There only Lord Shiva and 
cow is there on Shiva’s head.

484
00:41:27,904 --> 00:41:29,904
Does that circle signify the caves then?

485
00:41:30,971 --> 00:41:32,971
mm correct

486
00:41:33,168 --> 00:41:35,168
Then that aa..uu..AA..

487
00:41:36,461 --> 00:41:38,836
That’s what we have found out na.. 
Lets go and see there.

488
00:41:38,932 --> 00:41:39,956
Let’s start.

489
00:41:40,098 --> 00:41:41,101
Okay do one thing.

490
00:41:41,126 --> 00:41:42,959
Call sneha and tell her to go to room.

491
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:44,820
We will go to Bora caves and go to room.

492
00:43:58,527 --> 00:44:01,069
Sudharsan, did you come to 
know anything about the cow?

493
00:44:01,828 --> 00:44:06,204
Huh.. How to look.. There was this 
priest inside, ushering us to move.

494
00:44:06,608 --> 00:44:07,756
Wasn’t able to see anything.

495
00:44:07,898 --> 00:44:09,623
I was not able to look at 
Shivan itself in the darkness.

496
00:44:09,692 --> 00:44:11,375
Where to look for that cow!

497
00:44:11,461 --> 00:44:14,337
Below the lingam, i was able 
to see some three letters.

498
00:44:14,506 --> 00:44:15,714
Don’t know what that means.

499
00:44:15,739 --> 00:44:17,989
If we are able to find that 
out, we will get some clue.

500
00:44:18,026 --> 00:44:19,217
Hmm.. How do we see that clearly?

501
00:44:19,476 --> 00:44:22,157
They had decorated it 
with fruits and flowers.

502
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:28,092
I have a hunch that there might 
be something inside this cave.

503
00:44:28,468 --> 00:44:32,201
Yeah. In that hint too they had 
written inside the circle na?.

504
00:44:32,245 --> 00:44:32,744
Hmm..

505
00:44:33,391 --> 00:44:34,059
one minute.

506
00:44:35,799 --> 00:44:37,799
This cave was there in the 18th century.

507
00:44:37,864 --> 00:44:41,656
But only for the past 2 years there is this 
21 face Rudhraksha chain in Shivan’s neck.

508
00:44:42,207 --> 00:44:45,832
The technology of relating 
words and its numbers. Hmmm

509
00:44:47,183 --> 00:44:49,641
Those letters inside the 
circles

510
00:44:50,123 --> 00:44:52,581
are not some words, those are all numbers.

511
00:44:53,939 --> 00:44:57,824
I think there is something 
in that Rudhraksha chain.

512
00:44:58,825 --> 00:45:00,159
Tamil is so ancient right.

513
00:45:00,422 --> 00:45:02,923
It’s been there for the past 
2500 years specially crafted with

514
00:45:02,972 --> 00:45:05,471
numbers and phoenics without the 
intermixing of any languages.

515
00:45:06,009 --> 00:45:08,759
If Tamil had been those 
Britisher’s mother tongue,

516
00:45:09,057 --> 00:45:11,057
they would have made the whole 
world pray this language.

517
00:45:11,381 --> 00:45:13,381
We are uselessly roaming without 
knowing the worth of our language.

518
00:45:14,926 --> 00:45:17,343
Hmm.. Atleast we know 
to write and read Tamil,

519
00:45:17,511 --> 00:45:20,386
but the present generation 
are running away from Tamil.

520
00:45:20,682 --> 00:45:22,557
If this goes on like 
this, after 100 years we

521
00:45:22,582 --> 00:45:24,541
will be reading in English 
about ancient Tamil.

522
00:45:24,604 --> 00:45:26,146
We ourselves don’t 
know about the ancient tamil

523
00:45:26,287 --> 00:45:28,079
Hmm mmm yeah. As 
if you will be knowing.

524
00:45:29,639 --> 00:45:30,265
I found out.

525
00:45:32,825 --> 00:45:38,450
Aahh means 8, U means 2, A means 7. 
8..2..7..

526
00:45:38,674 --> 00:45:42,800
So The Rudhraksha which we 
need to take is 8, 2, 7.

527
00:45:44,749 --> 00:45:46,082
We can stay here tonight,

528
00:45:47,237 --> 00:45:48,820
collect information about 
all the things we need

529
00:45:49,426 --> 00:45:51,135
and leave in the morning 
along with the crowd.

530
00:45:52,194 --> 00:45:56,235
Ok, i’ll do one thing. I’ll go 
inside, design a plan and come.

531
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:05,303
Akhil?

532
00:46:05,392 --> 00:46:05,935
What happened?

533
00:46:06,418 --> 00:46:07,376
I planned perfectly.

534
00:46:07,742 --> 00:46:09,742
Lets go to room and discuss. Not here.

535
00:46:10,168 --> 00:46:11,459
Ok come lets go.

536
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:27,190
In the Keezhadi village of 
Shivagangai district, college

537
00:46:27,272 --> 00:46:29,772
professors and students 
are showing interest to

538
00:46:29,827 --> 00:46:32,535
take a look at the 
archeological remains which were

539
00:46:32,574 --> 00:46:35,199
discovered during the 
excavation in that village.

540
00:46:37,792 --> 00:46:42,209
In the district of vishakhapatnam 
in Andhra Pradesh, the 21

541
00:46:42,274 --> 00:46:46,649
faced Rudhraksha chain has been 
stolen from the Bora caves.

542
00:46:46,981 --> 00:46:51,480
Due to the sudden disappearance of the 
Rudhraksha which unexpectedly appeared

543
00:46:51,849 --> 00:46:56,391
in the neck of Lord Shiva before 2 years, 
there has been a hustle in that area.

544
00:46:56,696 --> 00:47:01,030
The policemen have filed a case 
on this and have been enquiring.

545
00:47:02,502 --> 00:47:04,711
News will be continued after a break.

546
00:47:05,926 --> 00:47:07,717
Hey Surya did you see the news? 
The rudhraksha

547
00:47:07,754 --> 00:47:09,462
has been stolen from 
the Bora caves it seems.

548
00:47:10,028 --> 00:47:10,528
Is it?

549
00:47:12,471 --> 00:47:13,429
Check if this the same one.

550
00:47:13,909 --> 00:47:15,326
Hey.... 
What?

551
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:19,517
Heyyy what have you done man!

552
00:47:20,142 --> 00:47:22,142
That’s what they are saying in Tv right. 
Look there.

553
00:47:23,126 --> 00:47:25,792
Don’t talk without knowing its seriousness. 
You have stolen it.

554
00:47:26,795 --> 00:47:30,837
OMG! If I have taken it without 
anyone’s knowledge, is it called Theft?

555
00:47:30,867 --> 00:47:31,826
What else is it then?

556
00:47:33,089 --> 00:47:35,465
Hey that’s why we 
came here right.

557
00:47:35,490 --> 00:47:37,490
Then what. Check it fast.

558
00:47:38,615 --> 00:47:39,532
Sneha give.

559
00:47:45,078 --> 00:47:47,536
21 faced Rudhraksha is there.

560
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:52,907
But how to find the 8, 2 and 7th face?

561
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:55,870
Arrey archeologist. Check it.

562
00:47:55,908 --> 00:47:57,449
Sneha, here look.

563
00:48:11,073 --> 00:48:12,073
Cut carefully.

564
00:48:37,187 --> 00:48:41,688
These are the 8th, 2nd and 7th faces.

565
00:48:41,776 --> 00:48:44,901
But, it doesn’t look like Rudhraksha.

566
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:47,165
Looks like some breakable content.

567
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:49,510
Give.

568
00:48:55,574 --> 00:48:56,490
Can we cut and check?

569
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:57,743
Hmm..

570
00:48:57,892 --> 00:48:58,683
We can try.

571
00:49:19,774 --> 00:49:21,441
It’s a memory card in a piece of paper.

572
00:49:22,096 --> 00:49:23,721
Surya, take that laptop.

573
00:49:27,909 --> 00:49:28,700
What is written?

574
00:49:28,907 --> 00:49:30,116
The rays of the rising glory.

575
00:49:30,394 --> 00:49:31,061
Look at this.

576
00:49:34,778 --> 00:49:35,820
I don’t understand anything.

577
00:49:45,074 --> 00:49:47,074
Hey Akhil, it’s asking for password yaar.

578
00:49:47,285 --> 00:49:49,285
That too we have only 3 chances.

579
00:49:49,876 --> 00:49:52,126
If all the three goes 
wrong it will be blocked.

580
00:49:53,669 --> 00:49:54,503
Password huh?

581
00:49:56,028 --> 00:50:03,361
Hmm... What if the password 
might be the hint in the paper?

582
00:50:03,801 --> 00:50:05,509
Read what is written.

583
00:50:05,792 --> 00:50:07,251
The rays of the rising glory.

584
00:50:08,217 --> 00:50:11,133
In here its written “Blossoming 
of the maiden’s heart”

585
00:50:12,022 --> 00:50:18,563
The two lined quotes says it all.

586
00:50:20,435 --> 00:50:23,810
The rays of the rising glory– 
maybe they denote the sun

587
00:50:24,381 --> 00:50:26,049
Then what does Blossoming 
of the maiden’s heart mean?

588
00:50:27,561 --> 00:50:29,853
Sun(another name), sun

589
00:50:30,893 --> 00:50:33,560
Akhil: denotes place 
Sneha: are they mentioning east west?

590
00:50:35,258 --> 00:50:38,508
Sun, beach, which side sun rises?

591
00:50:39,982 --> 00:50:41,982
Maybe Kanyakumari?

592
00:50:42,024 --> 00:50:43,566
so it could be kanyakumari?

593
00:50:44,104 --> 00:50:46,104
hmmm... kanyakumari...

594
00:50:46,155 --> 00:50:48,155
Surya, enter that.

595
00:50:57,149 --> 00:50:58,690
It’s wrong.

596
00:50:58,857 --> 00:51:00,523
You left that 3rd paper.

597
00:51:00,644 --> 00:51:03,310
The two lined quotes says it all.

598
00:51:05,368 --> 00:51:09,785
Hmm.. kanyakumari..

599
00:51:10,410 --> 00:51:12,576
what all are famous in kanyakumari?

600
00:51:12,682 --> 00:51:15,016
Beach.. Amman temple.

601
00:51:15,087 --> 00:51:16,420
Vivekanandar statue.

602
00:51:17,842 --> 00:51:19,842
Thiruvalluvar statue?

603
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:23,244
Huh? Thiruvalluvar.

604
00:51:23,718 --> 00:51:25,134
A sentence clipped to two...

605
00:51:26,184 --> 00:51:28,059
The one who ruled the world in 2 sentences.

606
00:51:28,147 --> 00:51:30,939
Thiruvalluvar. Why can’t it be?

607
00:51:31,312 --> 00:51:34,021
Hey Thiruvalluvar is the password.

608
00:51:34,374 --> 00:51:35,351
Check it.

609
00:51:36,321 --> 00:51:38,321
Hey only 2 chances are there.

610
00:51:38,628 --> 00:51:39,712
Arey put that yaar.

611
00:51:51,588 --> 00:51:52,797
Only one more chance.

612
00:51:52,842 --> 00:51:55,383
If that is also wrong then 
we have to return to chennai.

613
00:51:55,931 --> 00:51:57,347
One minute.

614
00:51:59,531 --> 00:52:03,156
Kanyakumari’s spelling can 
be written in many ways.

615
00:52:03,181 --> 00:52:05,722
Few write kann, and few write kan.

616
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:08,283
The same goes with thiruvalluvar.

617
00:52:09,173 --> 00:52:11,589
Few may put double L and few single L.

618
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:15,628
Words may change but numbers will never.

619
00:52:16,682 --> 00:52:19,016
So if these many things are right,

620
00:52:21,235 --> 00:52:23,609
why can’t the total number of 
thirukkural be the password?

621
00:52:24,324 --> 00:52:25,324
1330

622
00:52:28,794 --> 00:52:31,836
Hmm Okay.. You all stared at me 
when it was wrong the last time.

623
00:52:31,861 --> 00:52:34,361
Now we 4 are here right, 
let us all contribute.

624
00:52:36,246 --> 00:52:37,246
Hmm 1...

625
00:52:38,448 --> 00:52:40,448
Here you type 3..

626
00:52:41,751 --> 00:52:42,834
Hm..

627
00:52:47,105 --> 00:52:48,521
Here you too type 3..

628
00:52:53,914 --> 00:52:56,413
We still have time.. 
This is the last chance.

629
00:53:11,607 --> 00:53:13,024
Yaaayyy...

630
00:53:13,049 --> 00:53:15,299
It has opened.

631
00:53:15,324 --> 00:53:17,324
I know that before itself.yes...yes

632
00:53:22,259 --> 00:53:22,884
Akhil,

633
00:53:23,302 --> 00:53:26,677
I’m so happy that you have 
come so far just for me.

634
00:53:27,009 --> 00:53:31,342
Please destroy all the secrets 
regarding this treasure.

635
00:53:31,868 --> 00:53:34,743
Finally I’m searching for a subway.

636
00:53:34,974 --> 00:53:36,974
There are many dangers around me.

637
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:42,076
I don’t even know if I’ll be 
alive when you see this video.

638
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:45,716
Akhil open that zip file.

639
00:53:51,117 --> 00:53:52,367
What is there in that?

640
00:53:53,104 --> 00:53:54,230
There are 6 files.

641
00:53:56,423 --> 00:53:57,839
Open them one by one.

642
00:53:59,912 --> 00:54:01,620
Is this the burnt paper?

643
00:54:01,723 --> 00:54:02,806
Hmm..

644
00:54:03,276 --> 00:54:04,151
Oooh..

645
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:08,777
Then is this the paper which was stolen by 
your grandpa from the yaazh library?

646
00:54:10,154 --> 00:54:14,195
Was he in prison for this?

647
00:54:15,151 --> 00:54:16,068
Sorry man.

648
00:54:16,149 --> 00:54:17,607
What man...

649
00:54:18,219 --> 00:54:20,219
Sorry dude. I called your 
grandpa a thief in a flow.

650
00:54:21,952 --> 00:54:24,618
It hurts.. but that’s the truth right.

651
00:54:26,664 --> 00:54:29,580
Hmm okay. What case was that?

652
00:54:30,142 --> 00:54:32,142
Why did he go to prison?

653
00:54:33,365 --> 00:54:34,782
He will tell.

654
00:54:36,336 --> 00:54:37,669
In the yazhpanam library

655
00:54:39,068 --> 00:54:40,776
there were many historic 
records about Tamilians

656
00:54:40,827 --> 00:54:42,202
which would make the 
world agape in awe.

657
00:54:42,346 --> 00:54:46,888
There were many records about 
rare form of arts and secrets.

658
00:54:47,368 --> 00:54:49,035
In 1981,

659
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:51,711
my granpda who worked in 
archeology department,

660
00:54:51,964 --> 00:54:57,089
went to that library at night without any 
ones knowledge to collect few information.

661
00:54:57,772 --> 00:55:00,522
At that time few people set 
fire to that place and ran away.

662
00:55:01,001 --> 00:55:03,001
My grandpa luckily came back alive.

663
00:55:03,311 --> 00:55:06,435
He was able to save few scrolls.

664
00:55:06,891 --> 00:55:09,640
Without giving it to the 
government, he kept it to himself.

665
00:55:10,123 --> 00:55:11,873
For that he was charged.

666
00:55:12,813 --> 00:55:13,854
What happened at last?

667
00:55:14,207 --> 00:55:16,332
Half of the library was burnt.

668
00:55:16,774 --> 00:55:21,356
But no one knows what my 
grandpa took from there.

669
00:55:22,932 --> 00:55:25,991
As there wasn’t enough 
evidence, he was released.

670
00:55:26,163 --> 00:55:28,058
There is nothing wrong 
on your grandpa’s part.

671
00:55:28,083 --> 00:55:30,160
It would have burnt even 
if he hadn’t taken those.

672
00:55:31,886 --> 00:55:33,511
Let’s see the first file.

673
00:55:35,636 --> 00:55:38,428
In the year 2017, on 22nd of 
the tamil month chiththirai,

674
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:42,181
according to the orders of zhagaram, the 
day when the Swan’s placed had changed.

675
00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:46,442
With the entry to a new place, 
the old one changes, Tamilnadu.

676
00:55:48,172 --> 00:55:52,214
What does that zhagaram 
word mentioned there mean?

677
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,899
Even I don’t understand it Surya,

678
00:55:54,857 --> 00:55:56,857
Swan might be

679
00:55:57,217 --> 00:55:59,800
the code which the organisation 
had kept for the treasure.

680
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:04,724
okay. Look at the next one.

681
00:56:08,161 --> 00:56:11,078
Its some stone sculpture.

682
00:56:11,103 --> 00:56:11,894
Sculpture eh?

683
00:56:11,919 --> 00:56:13,919
See, if you can find anything?

684
00:56:20,212 --> 00:56:22,212
Its a very old sculpture.

685
00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:29,600
There are 6 people in the stance 
of praying with folded hands.

686
00:56:30,545 --> 00:56:32,545
It looks like those ancient cavemen.

687
00:56:37,247 --> 00:56:41,455
When we look at these stone structure I 
can definitely say they are Indian style.

688
00:56:43,152 --> 00:56:46,402
But since it is too old.. hmmm...

689
00:56:47,190 --> 00:56:50,232
You can find similiar 
structures in Ankerward temple.

690
00:56:50,594 --> 00:56:54,385
But if we need more details about this

691
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:56,785
we need to look for some 
senior archeologists.

692
00:56:57,331 --> 00:57:00,247
But they are only 4 to 5.

693
00:57:00,502 --> 00:57:02,502
Oye. You have studied 
the same subject right?

694
00:57:02,527 --> 00:57:03,652
Don’t you know?

695
00:57:04,322 --> 00:57:06,863
What are they going to do even if I know?

696
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:10,424
They will bury it like how 
it happened in Keezhadi.

697
00:57:10,516 --> 00:57:11,309
Give.

698
00:57:22,506 --> 00:57:27,922
It shows some dots and dotted lines.

699
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:29,612
Can’t understand anything.

700
00:57:29,870 --> 00:57:31,870
How many files are there more?

701
00:57:34,368 --> 00:57:35,618
3 files.

702
00:57:36,850 --> 00:57:38,063
Check the next one.

703
00:57:47,574 --> 00:57:48,740
Everything is in Arabic.

704
00:57:49,896 --> 00:57:52,855
What is this man! Everything is getting 
more complicated as we go deeper.

705
00:57:55,172 --> 00:57:56,713
One of my friends is in Dubai.

706
00:57:56,865 --> 00:57:59,406
Can we send this to him and ask for help?

707
00:57:59,938 --> 00:58:00,604
No.

708
00:58:00,904 --> 00:58:03,570
Let’s first see if we are 
able to solve anything.

709
00:58:03,907 --> 00:58:05,116
If we can’t we can ask him.

710
00:58:05,167 --> 00:58:05,666
Okay.

711
00:58:06,836 --> 00:58:08,836
Look for the next.

712
00:58:17,354 --> 00:58:19,354
It looks like some old destroyed painting.

713
00:58:24,497 --> 00:58:26,348
He will look at this and speak 
as if he knows this one too.

714
00:58:26,972 --> 00:58:30,722
Heyyy I’ve seen this somewhere. 
But I don’t remember where.

715
00:58:31,573 --> 00:58:35,198
Hmm mmm as if you have solved all the 
clues. Go go.. Look at the next one.

716
00:58:43,976 --> 00:58:46,124
haha..

717
00:58:46,210 --> 00:58:47,210
What happened.

718
00:58:47,235 --> 00:58:48,902
Only this thing is in Tamil

719
00:58:48,982 --> 00:58:50,982
What is written in it?

720
00:58:51,664 --> 00:59:06,539
(Lines from the Tamil Epic 
Manimekalai by Seethalai Saathanar)

721
00:59:08,111 --> 00:59:12,610
This is from the epic Manimekalai 
written by Seethalai Saathanaar.

722
00:59:13,315 --> 00:59:14,648
Do you know about that?

723
00:59:14,673 --> 00:59:15,298
Google it.

724
00:59:22,873 --> 00:59:28,332
(tamil lines) this means, 
the one who gives food to

725
00:59:28,357 --> 00:59:34,023
those who are able to earn 
it are businessmen. Haan..

726
00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:35,361
See it’s like this.

727
00:59:35,399 --> 00:59:38,441
Our Suds always gives 
treat to rich guys right.

728
00:59:38,511 --> 00:59:39,511
We shouldn’t do like this.

729
00:59:39,536 --> 00:59:40,245
Oye!

730
00:59:40,317 --> 00:59:41,108
Just Fun Yaa

731
00:59:41,172 --> 00:59:41,963
Look what’s next.

732
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:46,871
The true dharma lies in 
offering food to those

733
00:59:46,939 --> 00:59:49,772
who are in need of it. 
When one does like that,

734
00:59:49,797 --> 00:59:52,505
it equals to offering your own life. 
That is

735
00:59:52,530 --> 00:59:55,280
the meaning of “undi 
koduthor uyir koduthore”

736
00:59:57,548 --> 00:59:59,548
All are fine.

737
00:59:59,888 --> 01:00:01,888
But what is the relation 
between this and the treasure?

738
01:00:02,290 --> 01:00:03,082
No idea.

739
01:00:03,649 --> 01:00:05,649
We have to find that.

740
01:00:05,808 --> 01:00:08,933
We don’t know anything from these 6 clues.

741
01:00:10,176 --> 01:00:13,121
We started knowing nothing.

742
01:00:13,146 --> 01:00:14,563
But now we have come so far.

743
01:00:14,588 --> 01:00:16,130
It’s a big success for us.

744
01:00:17,298 --> 01:00:19,298
Now, where are we going next?

745
01:00:19,776 --> 01:00:20,610
Chennai.

746
01:00:22,334 --> 01:00:25,375
Hmm Akhil is faster than we thought.

747
01:00:28,865 --> 01:00:29,865
Come

748
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:35,280
akhil come

749
01:00:35,743 --> 01:00:38,141
The history is awaiting for your arrival

750
01:00:38,174 --> 01:00:40,201
and the treasure awaits your touch

751
01:00:40,458 --> 01:00:41,924
Far beyond the destiny

752
01:00:43,484 --> 01:00:46,483
The once fresh happy lands

753
01:00:47,031 --> 01:00:50,308
Destroyed by selfish hunger

754
01:00:50,974 --> 01:00:53,707
Come to teach the 
foolish people a lesson

755
01:00:54,084 --> 01:00:55,817
Escaped from the sun's heat

756
01:00:56,585 --> 01:00:58,663
hide from the eyes of wind

757
01:00:59,365 --> 01:01:02,946
come to witness the 
scene beyond the hands

758
01:01:04,097 --> 01:01:05,831
The blood stained warlands

759
01:01:06,318 --> 01:01:08,940
That survived natural disasters

760
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:11,418
awaits your footprints

761
01:01:11,987 --> 01:01:14,546
Come to rescue your treasure

762
01:01:27,779 --> 01:01:51,752
tamil poet lines

763
01:01:51,777 --> 01:01:54,572
To end the sufferings of ZHAGARAM

764
01:01:58,407 --> 01:02:01,525
Come oh hero, come oh Akhil

765
01:02:14,675 --> 01:02:18,475
Wow... The feel of Chennai.. 
I need to eat briyani first.

766
01:02:19,526 --> 01:02:23,732
Because of people like you only 
there is food scarcity in the nation.

767
01:02:23,757 --> 01:02:26,842
Hey I didn’t say this man. 
Central minister told.

768
01:02:27,052 --> 01:02:28,052
Oh.. is it?

769
01:02:33,713 --> 01:02:37,913
Dad is calling me. I came here 
with the excuse of office tour.

770
01:02:41,306 --> 01:02:42,306
Hello Sir

771
01:02:42,342 --> 01:02:47,998
Hello Sneha.You’ve given me all the 
info I asked for. You can now leave.

772
01:02:48,235 --> 01:02:49,991
Sir... That..

773
01:02:51,269 --> 01:02:52,603
I told you to leave.

774
01:02:52,653 --> 01:02:53,653
Hmm sure sir.

775
01:03:04,501 --> 01:03:05,965
Hey...Spoke with dad?

776
01:03:06,237 --> 01:03:09,807
Yeah. He’s asking me come there tomorrow.

777
01:03:13,726 --> 01:03:15,126
Hey it’s him calling.

778
01:03:23,234 --> 01:03:25,598
Hi Akhil, are your searching 
for the treasure or not?

779
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:28,038
Yes we are.

780
01:03:29,486 --> 01:03:34,214
I asked only you three to search for that. 
Looks like you are roaming with some girl.

781
01:03:34,434 --> 01:03:36,101
Who’s that? Is it Sneha?

782
01:03:36,126 --> 01:03:37,126
Send her off.

783
01:03:38,269 --> 01:03:43,002
Don’t waste much time. Find the 
treasure soon. I’ll meet you in person.

784
01:03:44,536 --> 01:03:48,175
he’s saying about Sneha now. 
It’s not very simple.

785
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:51,308
He’s really spying on us.

786
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:54,260
Yes.

787
01:03:56,623 --> 01:03:59,623
Okay so how are we going 
solve the clues now?

788
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:02,340
We need a really talented archeologist.

789
01:04:02,462 --> 01:04:03,462
Oyeee.

790
01:04:03,514 --> 01:04:06,485
Chill. You are leaving right. 
That’s why I said like that.

791
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:07,222
Hmmm ok ok..

792
01:04:07,247 --> 01:04:11,335
We’ll do like this Let’s 
show all the clues to someone

793
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:13,723
we know and ask them about it. 
We might get some clue.

794
01:04:13,992 --> 01:04:16,191
And yeah one of my uncle 
is there in Tirupur.

795
01:04:16,534 --> 01:04:21,168
He’s not an archeologist but he has 
lots of collection of antique materials

796
01:04:21,446 --> 01:04:23,474
Can we ask him?

797
01:04:23,499 --> 01:04:24,499
Yeah

798
01:04:24,696 --> 01:04:28,629
If so, I know one cab. I’ll 
make the arrangements for you.

799
01:04:29,150 --> 01:04:30,220
Hmm okay.

800
01:04:30,337 --> 01:04:33,801
So we will leave now and make the 
packings for tirupur. Come let’s go.

801
01:04:39,362 --> 01:04:40,779
Hello. Hey where’s the cab.

802
01:04:41,032 --> 01:04:42,987
He’s near only. Wait.

803
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:45,900
Haan he’s coming. I saw him.

804
01:04:45,967 --> 01:04:48,101
His one ear is deaf. Careful ok?

805
01:04:48,126 --> 01:04:50,350
Like Nayanthara in Naanum Rowdy Thaan eh?

806
01:04:50,426 --> 01:04:51,692
Okay Okay I saw him

807
01:04:52,678 --> 01:04:55,526
He wouldn’t be able to hear if we speak 
anything about the treasure na!

808
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:56,618
It’s good only.

809
01:04:57,099 --> 01:04:58,683
Guys the cab is here.

810
01:04:59,124 --> 01:05:00,124
Travel safe.

811
01:05:20,088 --> 01:05:21,221
Sir can we leave?

812
01:05:23,421 --> 01:05:25,493
Om Namashivaaya.

813
01:05:26,117 --> 01:05:29,713
Kantha Kadamba Kathirvela 
Karthikeya (Hindu God’s names).

814
01:05:30,398 --> 01:05:33,163
Make us all reach safely.

815
01:05:33,937 --> 01:05:37,646
Vigneshwara vinayaka pillaiyaaare 
Moothone (Hindu God’s names)

816
01:05:37,901 --> 01:05:40,516
us all reach safely.

817
01:05:40,963 --> 01:05:44,943
Alleluya Jesus be with us. Allahuakba

818
01:05:47,060 --> 01:05:48,527
Hey it’s getting late.

819
01:05:50,283 --> 01:05:51,816
Hey he can’t hear too..

820
01:05:55,329 --> 01:05:56,796
Thank God he finished.

821
01:05:59,365 --> 01:06:01,298
Why is it not starting? Hmm..

822
01:06:02,850 --> 01:06:04,317
Bro it’s not starting.

823
01:06:04,682 --> 01:06:06,549
Again I’ll say it 108 times.

824
01:06:07,264 --> 01:06:08,397
What! 108 times!

825
01:06:09,010 --> 01:06:10,610
(chanting mantras again)

826
01:06:11,122 --> 01:06:15,055
Hey.. If it goes like this then 
we will reach tomorrow only

827
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:17,867
hey from where u got him?

828
01:06:20,178 --> 01:06:21,578
I’ll walk to tirupur!

829
01:06:22,735 --> 01:06:25,191
Hey wait man. Stay calm or else 
he will say it again 108 times.

830
01:06:25,216 --> 01:06:27,016
Let me think of some idea.

831
01:06:27,346 --> 01:06:29,013
Hey the vehicle started.

832
01:06:29,434 --> 01:06:32,634
God’s blessing for you. 
All of you pray to God.

833
01:06:36,169 --> 01:06:40,641
It’s good for you too. Shall we start?

834
01:07:06,932 --> 01:07:08,062
Is he your uncle?

835
01:07:08,087 --> 01:07:09,087
Yeah

836
01:07:12,386 --> 01:07:15,149
Welcome Surya. How are you? 
How’s everyone home?

837
01:07:15,174 --> 01:07:16,328
Yeah all are fine.

838
01:07:16,465 --> 01:07:17,465
Welcome welcome.

839
01:07:17,765 --> 01:07:21,098
And why I came here is, 
Akhil too is like you only

840
01:07:21,596 --> 01:07:23,434
So much love for Tamil.

841
01:07:23,459 --> 01:07:27,425
He’s doing research on antique 
sculptures and paintings.

842
01:07:30,078 --> 01:07:32,601
Oh ok ok. What should I do for you?

843
01:07:32,626 --> 01:07:37,826
Sir like Surya said if you can give me 
the details about the historic scrolls

844
01:07:38,009 --> 01:07:42,746
paintings it’d be useful for my research.

845
01:07:42,991 --> 01:07:44,769
What am I going to do with all those?

846
01:07:44,976 --> 01:07:49,290
All are lying uselessly. 
Sit, I’ll bring them.

847
01:07:51,785 --> 01:07:54,108
Hey. What are guys doing without 
concentrating on the important work.

848
01:07:54,133 --> 01:07:58,293
If we ask him immediately about those he 
will be skeptical. Come let’s go and sit.

849
01:08:19,293 --> 01:08:22,629
Have a look which all 
will be useful for you.

850
01:08:24,939 --> 01:08:26,728
I don’t remember what all are there

851
01:08:26,753 --> 01:08:29,202
It has been locked inside that 
room for the past 10 to 15 years

852
01:08:29,227 --> 01:08:31,360
Look which you will be needing.

853
01:08:36,151 --> 01:08:39,472
Why are you getting hiccups? 
Wait I’ll bring water.

854
01:08:59,067 --> 01:09:01,148
Here drink some water.

855
01:09:04,405 --> 01:09:05,805
Sir what is this one?

856
01:09:08,976 --> 01:09:12,024
This is Dhrovpathi and Pandavas.

857
01:09:12,709 --> 01:09:17,109
This rock is located in Karnataka 
in a place called Ambatheertha.

858
01:09:18,507 --> 01:09:20,312
Oh. Sir do you know 
anything else about this?

859
01:09:20,337 --> 01:09:22,679
I don’t know much about this

860
01:09:22,704 --> 01:09:27,467
But our ancestors have done 
many rock paintings like this.

861
01:09:27,492 --> 01:09:28,875
If we hadn’t known these

862
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:32,444
we would not have known about their 
existence and their lifestyle.

863
01:09:33,112 --> 01:09:34,263
What are trying to say?

864
01:09:34,443 --> 01:09:37,236
Are you saying that Mahabharat, 
Ramayana all are true?

865
01:09:37,261 --> 01:09:42,056
The places which were said to be drowned 
under the seas in history like Dwaraka

866
01:09:42,210 --> 01:09:43,982
was found in Gurajat, 
under the waters.

867
01:09:44,567 --> 01:09:46,996
There are many researches 
going on related to that.

868
01:09:47,692 --> 01:09:50,761
What I’m thinking is, for 
the great mahabharat war,

869
01:09:50,939 --> 01:09:53,007
the writer has used his tactics 
and with the help of magic like

870
01:09:53,070 --> 01:09:54,946
the saree which came 
out never ending

871
01:09:54,971 --> 01:09:58,582
and like flying from 
one place to another,

872
01:09:58,886 --> 01:10:01,686
he has weaved an 
interesting tale to read.

873
01:10:01,762 --> 01:10:03,295
I dont think like that.

874
01:10:03,912 --> 01:10:06,171
It might be true

875
01:10:06,313 --> 01:10:10,447
or our poets could have added 
some fantasy too while writing.

876
01:10:10,559 --> 01:10:12,492
Something about this please?

877
01:10:14,164 --> 01:10:17,308
A saint and a Lotus.

878
01:10:18,271 --> 01:10:23,456
Surya, in net search for 
Sithanavasal painting.

879
01:10:31,363 --> 01:10:34,233
Haan this is the one.

880
01:10:34,509 --> 01:10:37,909
This is the Sithanavasal 
painting near Pudukottai.

881
01:10:37,998 --> 01:10:39,132
I told you right.

882
01:10:39,428 --> 01:10:42,694
Okay sir. Thank you so much. 
We are leaving now.

883
01:10:44,343 --> 01:10:49,194
You have come this far. You cannot 
leave without eating something

884
01:10:49,284 --> 01:10:51,945
Yeah let’s eat and leave. 
Why so much hurry?

885
01:10:51,970 --> 01:10:53,437
Uncle will be hurt na?

886
01:11:10,465 --> 01:11:12,965
It’s our road, our place

887
01:11:13,168 --> 01:11:16,154
but see how many tolls are 
there and how much they charge

888
01:11:16,395 --> 01:11:18,372
When looking at all these 
it’s really frustrating.

889
01:11:19,579 --> 01:11:23,610
If a person eats with salt in his food 
and is daring enough he shouldn’t pay

890
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:24,800
u paid just now

891
01:11:25,007 --> 01:11:26,141
Your money right?

892
01:11:26,502 --> 01:11:28,168
You should have asked na?

893
01:11:29,071 --> 01:11:30,625
You should have asked them na?

894
01:11:30,688 --> 01:11:31,755
I asked once...

895
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:35,569
They slapped me hard. From that day 
onwards I’m not able to hear properly.

896
01:11:36,407 --> 01:11:39,643
Now only we are getting to know the 
reason why he is deaf one side dude.

897
01:11:41,295 --> 01:11:42,362
Nothing nothing.

898
01:11:42,456 --> 01:11:44,556
Akhil, why are you looking at that still?

899
01:11:44,671 --> 01:11:46,861
Did you notice what’s happening here?

900
01:11:47,207 --> 01:11:49,512
Where are we going next? 
Karnataka or Pudukottai?

901
01:11:49,796 --> 01:11:50,796
Nowhere.

902
01:11:51,603 --> 01:11:52,901
We are going to Chennai.

903
01:11:52,926 --> 01:11:54,562
Before grandpa passed away,

904
01:11:54,826 --> 01:11:56,678
he said he needs to 
find the secret passage.

905
01:11:56,751 --> 01:11:59,550
Now are next work is to find 
where that passage will be.

906
01:11:59,872 --> 01:12:02,854
It can be in karnataka 
or pudukottai right?

907
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:06,545
I don’t think so.

908
01:12:06,944 --> 01:12:08,856
Hey look at this.

909
01:12:08,975 --> 01:12:12,545
It looks like there is difference 
between these two pictures na?

910
01:12:14,508 --> 01:12:15,841
Look at this place.

911
01:12:17,542 --> 01:12:19,696
Yeah. There is something.

912
01:12:20,595 --> 01:12:22,822
Look at this print. There is Lotus.

913
01:12:23,506 --> 01:12:24,506
Yeah.

914
01:12:25,579 --> 01:12:26,712
But look at this.

915
01:12:33,979 --> 01:12:37,043
Wow. What a minute difference.

916
01:12:37,436 --> 01:12:41,958
They have drawn something and hidden 
it in the place of that lotus flower

917
01:12:42,105 --> 01:12:44,171
But what does this vessel mean?

918
01:12:44,952 --> 01:12:48,306
I have studied it inch by inch 
but not able to decode anything

919
01:12:48,681 --> 01:12:50,543
Even after knowing that 2 and 6 clue,

920
01:12:50,568 --> 01:12:52,522
we are not able to find the treasure.

921
01:12:52,876 --> 01:12:54,963
We need to know what 
those Arabic letters are.

922
01:12:54,990 --> 01:12:57,590
Can I whatsapp this image to my friend?

923
01:12:58,262 --> 01:13:00,489
Dont send him the whole thing. 
Send him only half of it.

924
01:13:00,514 --> 01:13:02,314
How do I know which is 
full and which is half?

925
01:13:02,339 --> 01:13:05,423
Usually Arabic letters will 
be written from right to left.

926
01:13:05,448 --> 01:13:08,983
So send him only the 
right side portions.

927
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:10,360
Haan. Okay.

928
01:13:16,163 --> 01:13:18,237
Can we go for a small break and come?

929
01:13:18,491 --> 01:13:19,491
Okay.

930
01:13:35,074 --> 01:13:36,964
I’ve stopped the vehicle

931
01:13:37,731 --> 01:13:39,065
Everything is fine.

932
01:13:40,136 --> 01:13:41,962
I’ll keep updating you.

933
01:13:43,833 --> 01:13:47,766
Forgetting that I’m deaf I 
answer their questions sometimes

934
01:13:48,281 --> 01:13:52,081
Even then these foolish guys 
are not able to find it out.

935
01:13:52,741 --> 01:13:54,500
Surya is talking too much

936
01:13:54,525 --> 01:13:56,735
He’s going to get nice beatings from me.

937
01:13:57,766 --> 01:14:00,115
Looks like they are coming.

938
01:14:00,462 --> 01:14:02,254
I’ll call you later.

939
01:14:10,624 --> 01:14:12,022
Hello Sudharsan.

940
01:14:13,517 --> 01:14:14,517
Project Huk

941
01:14:14,985 --> 01:14:16,718
No one has doubted you na?

942
01:14:16,877 --> 01:14:18,943
Everything is going as per plan

943
01:14:19,426 --> 01:14:23,893
I’ll bring you the treasure even 
if it involves killing these two.

944
01:14:23,918 --> 01:14:26,118
Good. Always keep your phone on.

945
01:14:27,403 --> 01:14:30,070
Sure. Just look into 
the money I asked.

946
01:14:44,626 --> 01:14:47,376
Hey have you informed Sneha?

947
01:14:47,653 --> 01:14:48,653
Yup done.

948
01:14:50,574 --> 01:14:51,574
Hello..

949
01:14:54,479 --> 01:14:55,479
Accident huh?

950
01:14:59,539 --> 01:15:00,806
What happened yaar?

951
01:15:00,831 --> 01:15:02,698
My dad met with an accident.

952
01:15:03,950 --> 01:15:10,036
Don’t worry. He will be fine. 
Let’s leave immediately.

953
01:15:36,085 --> 01:15:38,045
Mom. It’s nothing. 
Everything will be alright

954
01:15:48,168 --> 01:15:49,148
Let’s leave.

955
01:15:55,462 --> 01:15:59,331
Surya, I guess this is 
the work of that gang.

956
01:15:59,454 --> 01:16:00,846
Why don’t we file a 
complaint to the police?

957
01:16:02,301 --> 01:16:04,018
We were worried for thier lives right?

958
01:16:04,131 --> 01:16:09,465
Look what happened now! It’s an accident 
again. They have tried to kill my dad.

959
01:16:10,345 --> 01:16:13,545
I don’t think those people 
would have done this.

960
01:16:13,952 --> 01:16:15,921
How are saying this so surely?

961
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:19,396
Simple logic man. What they need is 
the treasure and we are looking for it.

962
01:16:19,577 --> 01:16:21,645
If they did this accident, 
then the search will be delayed.

963
01:16:21,750 --> 01:16:24,058
So, the lose is for them. Not for us.

964
01:16:24,135 --> 01:16:25,910
They might have done 
this to fasten us up na?

965
01:16:26,967 --> 01:16:28,188
Hey! Look!

966
01:16:28,423 --> 01:16:29,868
I don’t know the reason behind this.

967
01:16:30,422 --> 01:16:34,489
But if anything happens to my 
dad I won’t spare their lives.

968
01:16:45,683 --> 01:16:48,283
Akhil is again making us do something.

969
01:17:14,834 --> 01:17:15,581
Akhil,

970
01:17:17,586 --> 01:17:19,519
what are we going to do now?

971
01:17:20,173 --> 01:17:22,239
You both leave to your native.

972
01:17:23,224 --> 01:17:24,490
Then that treasure?

973
01:17:24,762 --> 01:17:26,707
If I go in search of that treasure, 
even after these many incidents,

974
01:17:27,292 --> 01:17:30,492
there won’t be a great fool like me. 
Then you...

975
01:17:30,858 --> 01:17:33,858
Don’t talk anything. 
Let me see what he does.

976
01:17:47,641 --> 01:17:48,998
Huh huh.. Hello..

977
01:17:49,210 --> 01:17:52,722
Sudharsan, I’ve given you so much money 
than which you are capable of earning.

978
01:17:52,916 --> 01:17:54,698
There’s a trouble here.

979
01:17:55,227 --> 01:17:58,236
I know what to do. Just listen to me.

980
01:18:07,991 --> 01:18:08,991
Surya..

981
01:18:12,679 --> 01:18:16,250
Hmm... Give me the Swan and get back Sneha.

982
01:18:17,166 --> 01:18:19,033
What are we going to do now.

983
01:18:23,867 --> 01:18:25,864
Hey why are silent man?

984
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:31,629
No idea. How did Sneha fall in their trap?

985
01:18:31,966 --> 01:18:33,169
I told you right? Didn’t I?

986
01:18:34,013 --> 01:18:37,746
I told you they will go to any extent right! Now look..

987
01:18:37,881 --> 01:18:40,106
He knows everything which we do.

988
01:18:40,131 --> 01:18:42,049
That’s what even I’m asking. How?

989
01:18:42,377 --> 01:18:43,939
We don’t have time to think about that.

990
01:18:44,090 --> 01:18:46,703
Your unwanted decision has 
now cost the life of Sneha.

991
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:50,692
Let us just give the treasure to them and 
bring Sneha back. We have no other option.

992
01:18:50,717 --> 01:18:52,784
Yeeah man. Sudharsan is right.

993
01:18:53,018 --> 01:18:58,287
Oneday he will fall in our trap. 
Let’s now start from where we left.

994
01:19:00,104 --> 01:19:01,104
Hello

995
01:19:01,155 --> 01:19:02,922
Did you get the message akhil?

996
01:19:03,881 --> 01:19:05,547
Do you want Sneha or not?

997
01:19:06,784 --> 01:19:08,518
I told you earlier right.

998
01:19:08,963 --> 01:19:11,986
You can't escape without 
finding that treaure for me.

999
01:19:12,186 --> 01:19:14,653
Look, if anything happens to Sneha...

1000
01:19:15,084 --> 01:19:17,350
Stop saying these Cinema dialogues

1001
01:19:18,034 --> 01:19:19,634
I’ve seen many like this

1002
01:19:20,735 --> 01:19:24,669
Do what I say and then you 
and your friends will be fine.

1003
01:19:25,006 --> 01:19:29,910
Don’t try such heroic acts. 
I’m watching your every move.

1004
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:31,500
Be careful.

1005
01:19:50,321 --> 01:19:53,551
You had messaged your Dubai friend 
na, did you receive any reply?

1006
01:19:54,198 --> 01:19:56,532
Yeah.. Akhil, that is Arabic only.

1007
01:19:57,214 --> 01:20:00,014
They are saying that as Syed-Al-Buhari.

1008
01:20:00,230 --> 01:20:01,430
What does it mean?

1009
01:20:01,830 --> 01:20:05,306
It’s a book written by the disciples 
of Nabigal Nayagam for him.

1010
01:20:06,225 --> 01:20:08,158
Ohh... Akhil, take that hint.

1011
01:20:09,691 --> 01:20:11,705
Here. There are 3 numbers and 3 words.

1012
01:20:12,025 --> 01:20:14,063
Don’t know what that is. 
We have to find that.

1013
01:20:15,822 --> 01:20:20,222
I have asked that too.. 
It’s the chapter and volume in that book.

1014
01:20:20,971 --> 01:20:23,641
If that book is with us, 
we can find it easily.

1015
01:20:23,806 --> 01:20:25,941
Hey there is google search na. 
Let me check there.

1016
01:20:26,032 --> 01:20:27,028
Look..

1017
01:20:28,708 --> 01:20:31,506
There was a person called Jabbir. 
He went to Nabigal and said

1018
01:20:31,858 --> 01:20:33,989
“My dad had got money from many 
people and now he is no more.

1019
01:20:34,068 --> 01:20:36,316
We are only left with the 
dates and nothing else.

1020
01:20:36,453 --> 01:20:40,169
Even if it takes several years we 
wont be able to pay off the debt.

1021
01:20:40,389 --> 01:20:42,793
The lenders will behave were badly.

1022
01:20:42,876 --> 01:20:45,731
I’m so scared. Can you accompany me too?”

1023
01:20:46,036 --> 01:20:51,072
Nabigal went with him and gave the 
blessings of Allah on the heap of dates

1024
01:20:51,613 --> 01:20:53,850
And when they check the 
weight of it after that,

1025
01:20:53,925 --> 01:20:58,180
there was another heap of dates 
with the same quantity

1026
01:20:58,314 --> 01:21:01,143
left for them after paying off the debts.

1027
01:21:01,272 --> 01:21:04,793
What is there in this? 
He has done many wonders like this.

1028
01:21:05,461 --> 01:21:07,476
Did you notice something?

1029
01:21:07,834 --> 01:21:11,031
All the clues are related to food.

1030
01:21:11,056 --> 01:21:15,160
Yeah. Manimekalai, Sithanavasal 
painting, the begging bowl and now this.

1031
01:21:15,833 --> 01:21:19,537
But, in the hint 2, there was pandavas na? 
There was anything related to food in that.

1032
01:21:20,534 --> 01:21:21,534
Correct

1033
01:21:28,092 --> 01:21:30,433
Hey Surya look at this.

1034
01:21:32,239 --> 01:21:36,306
There is a vessel in the 2nd clue too. 
We hadn’t noticed it.

1035
01:21:37,357 --> 01:21:38,357
Is it?

1036
01:21:39,139 --> 01:21:45,769
But what is relation between 
Pandavas, Dhrowpathi and this vessel?

1037
01:21:45,921 --> 01:21:47,654
I can’t decipher anything.

1038
01:21:47,829 --> 01:21:51,297
I’ll tell you what I know.

1039
01:21:52,296 --> 01:21:54,896
Just see if anything is useful for you.

1040
01:21:55,303 --> 01:21:58,280
Dhrowpathi and the five Pandavas 
went into the forest right?

1041
01:21:58,379 --> 01:22:01,066
Many saints and travellers 
had come to visit them.

1042
01:22:01,468 --> 01:22:04,299
We need to offer food to 
those who visit us right?

1043
01:22:04,599 --> 01:22:06,638
How will they get food in the forest?

1044
01:22:07,003 --> 01:22:08,581
Dharma felt so embarrased.

1045
01:22:09,033 --> 01:22:11,101
So at that time, a saint called Dhomaiyar,

1046
01:22:11,225 --> 01:22:13,358
told them to pray the Sun Lord.

1047
01:22:13,992 --> 01:22:19,589
When Dharma prayed, the Sun Lord felt 
so elated and gave him a Akshayapaatiram

1048
01:22:19,877 --> 01:22:23,212
And dhrowpathi offered them food with that.

1049
01:22:24,950 --> 01:22:28,021
Akshay means imperishable.

1050
01:22:28,111 --> 01:22:30,477
The food content in that will 
not reduce even after serving.

1051
01:22:31,342 --> 01:22:34,596
That’s alright man. But what s the 
relation between that and the treasure?

1052
01:22:34,651 --> 01:22:36,069
I too don’t understand that.

1053
01:22:36,243 --> 01:22:38,043
What all clues are pending?

1054
01:22:38,407 --> 01:22:41,215
The 3rd one. No idea what it is.

1055
01:22:41,651 --> 01:22:43,559
Oh the lines and dots.

1056
01:22:44,930 --> 01:22:47,660
Can we ask for someone’s help?

1057
01:22:48,871 --> 01:22:50,991
To whom will you ask and what?

1058
01:22:53,511 --> 01:22:55,444
Where all to search for you?

1059
01:22:55,575 --> 01:22:58,307
Akhil why are standing 
outside in this cool weather?

1060
01:22:58,517 --> 01:22:59,784
Didn’t you come to eat?

1061
01:22:59,809 --> 01:23:02,435
Why did you come up at this time dad? 
Go and take rest dad.

1062
01:23:02,983 --> 01:23:05,365
I’m fine yaar. Come and eat.

1063
01:23:05,430 --> 01:23:06,775
You go dad. We will come.

1064
01:23:06,839 --> 01:23:07,931
Okay. Come soon.

1065
01:23:17,936 --> 01:23:20,269
Hmm.. This is thanthi coding right?

1066
01:23:20,751 --> 01:23:21,969
What? Thanthi?

1067
01:23:22,026 --> 01:23:24,480
This generation wouldn;t 
know all these things.

1068
01:23:24,876 --> 01:23:27,602
I used this when i was working 
in the postal department.

1069
01:23:27,756 --> 01:23:31,089
You guys have this facebook, 
whatsapp and all na.

1070
01:23:31,432 --> 01:23:35,651
Okay, mom is calling you all to have food. 
First have your food.

1071
01:23:40,158 --> 01:23:43,699
How do we find what these symbols are?

1072
01:23:44,041 --> 01:23:46,641
The whole world is inside my hands man!

1073
01:23:54,559 --> 01:23:59,704
Every english alphabet and 
number has a coding. Here..

1074
01:24:03,881 --> 01:24:05,748
This is a hint about Bible.

1075
01:24:08,438 --> 01:24:13,105
Previously it was Nabigal Nayagam, 
related to Quran. Now it is Bible.

1076
01:24:15,188 --> 01:24:16,385
You see

1077
01:24:16,706 --> 01:24:19,701
there also they would have mentioned 
Jesus did something with food.

1078
01:24:19,953 --> 01:24:20,979
How are you saying.

1079
01:24:21,107 --> 01:24:22,440
Search it in google.

1080
01:24:30,534 --> 01:24:33,601
Hey Akhil, you are right man.

1081
01:24:34,329 --> 01:24:35,329
Wait I’ll read.

1082
01:24:36,716 --> 01:24:39,406
Once upon a time when 
people came to meet Jesus,

1083
01:24:39,431 --> 01:24:44,431
he realized they were hungry. So he 
asked his disciples to bring some food.

1084
01:24:44,456 --> 01:24:48,199
They brought 5 appam and 2 fishes.

1085
01:24:48,862 --> 01:24:52,789
Jesus blessed it and gave 
back to his disciples

1086
01:24:53,054 --> 01:24:54,921
they served it to the people

1087
01:24:54,946 --> 01:24:57,315
Even after everyone 
had their stomachs full,

1088
01:24:57,603 --> 01:24:59,870
they took 12 baskets full of food.

1089
01:25:00,091 --> 01:25:02,304
In total 5000 people would have eaten.

1090
01:25:02,884 --> 01:25:05,921
Hey this isn’t any new story. 
It’s all the same old one.

1091
01:25:06,573 --> 01:25:10,128
Okay. Answer me something.

1092
01:25:11,409 --> 01:25:14,355
2nd clue was the five pandavas.

1093
01:25:14,551 --> 01:25:15,966
Yeah Mahabharat.

1094
01:25:16,090 --> 01:25:17,367
When did it take place?

1095
01:25:19,229 --> 01:25:20,761
B.C 950?

1096
01:25:21,934 --> 01:25:24,124
Next clue Jesus. That one?

1097
01:25:25,099 --> 01:25:26,767
B.C.46

1098
01:25:27,602 --> 01:25:28,319
Manimekalai?

1099
01:25:28,370 --> 01:25:29,970
That one AD 1st century.

1100
01:25:31,142 --> 01:25:33,402
Next is nabigal nayagam. 
When did it happen?

1101
01:25:33,911 --> 01:25:35,369
AD 6th century.

1102
01:25:36,314 --> 01:25:39,214
Sithanavasal painting is AD 7th century.

1103
01:25:39,546 --> 01:25:41,472
It’s there in my uncle’s book. Remember?

1104
01:25:42,224 --> 01:25:45,456
OMG! What I thought is right.

1105
01:25:45,614 --> 01:25:47,947
What did you think? What is right?

1106
01:25:48,747 --> 01:25:52,814
Look here.. From the 2nd to the 
6th clue

1107
01:25:53,151 --> 01:25:55,422
BC 950, BC 5,

1108
01:25:55,447 --> 01:25:58,485
AD 1, AD 600, AD 700.

1109
01:25:59,414 --> 01:26:02,214
Everything has happened in the next years.

1110
01:26:02,275 --> 01:26:03,275
So what?

1111
01:26:04,842 --> 01:26:08,409
There some historic relation between 
that treasure and these events.

1112
01:26:08,651 --> 01:26:09,917
I don’t understand.

1113
01:26:11,119 --> 01:26:14,385
I’ll explain you. 
What was there in the 1st clue?

1114
01:26:14,902 --> 01:26:16,035
The burnt paper.

1115
01:26:16,529 --> 01:26:19,032
In that they had mentioned is 
as the Annaparavai (Swan) right?

1116
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:20,340
Yeah.

1117
01:26:20,599 --> 01:26:21,999
What does annam mean?

1118
01:26:22,417 --> 01:26:24,012
It means food.

1119
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:27,473
Yes. Here annam denotes food.

1120
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,554
Then what does the Paravai mean?

1121
01:26:30,001 --> 01:26:33,267
We can say it flew from 
one century to the other

1122
01:26:33,666 --> 01:26:37,133
or we can say it flew from 
one person to the other.

1123
01:26:38,652 --> 01:26:40,791
What flew?

1124
01:26:41,654 --> 01:26:43,365
The treasure.

1125
01:26:47,904 --> 01:26:49,765
Don’t you understand even now?

1126
01:26:49,815 --> 01:26:52,011
The treasure is nothing but the vessel

1127
01:26:52,046 --> 01:26:55,240
which Dhrowpathi had, 
with which Jesus did wonders,

1128
01:26:55,561 --> 01:26:59,294
with whichManimekalai gave feast and 
nabigal nayagam did wonders.

1129
01:26:59,356 --> 01:27:04,124
the vessel, the “AkshayaPaatiram”

1130
01:27:07,058 --> 01:27:09,910
So the treasure which we are searching 
for is the Akshaya Paatiram huh?

1131
01:27:10,031 --> 01:27:11,857
And not gold, diamond or anything else?

1132
01:27:11,946 --> 01:27:12,946
Definitely no.

1133
01:27:13,030 --> 01:27:15,263
My grandpa had mentioned 
in that letter that

1134
01:27:15,313 --> 01:27:17,082
it cannot be bought with 
any amount of money.

1135
01:27:17,343 --> 01:27:20,880
Gold and diamond are not 
even a tad bit equal to this.

1136
01:27:22,337 --> 01:27:24,337
You don’t understand. Do you?

1137
01:27:25,247 --> 01:27:29,247
Do you know what all can be 
done with the help of that bowl?

1138
01:27:30,134 --> 01:27:31,880
You can completely eradicate poverty.

1139
01:27:32,063 --> 01:27:33,786
There won’t be any 
deaths due to starvation.

1140
01:27:34,043 --> 01:27:36,109
You can turn this world green.

1141
01:27:36,482 --> 01:27:38,122
A world without starvation

1142
01:27:38,690 --> 01:27:41,471
where everyone can get food to eat. 
How wonderful would it be.

1143
01:27:41,549 --> 01:27:42,991
In the olden days they used to sing,

1144
01:27:43,016 --> 01:27:46,009
if there isn’t food for a single man 
we would destroy the whole world”

1145
01:27:46,034 --> 01:27:49,578
But not it’s like they will destroy 
the world for a single man’s food.

1146
01:27:49,822 --> 01:27:54,255
Man has started killing plants, trees, 
animals and everything for his selfishness

1147
01:27:54,281 --> 01:27:58,081
If this bowl comes out, 
definitely they would spare that.

1148
01:27:59,275 --> 01:28:01,793
Everyone will fight among their 
states to get hold of this

1149
01:28:01,987 --> 01:28:05,425
Then between nations.

1150
01:28:05,561 --> 01:28:08,852
That’s why my grandpa had mentioned 
destruction is for sure if it comes out.

1151
01:28:09,512 --> 01:28:15,706
I’ve a doubt. There is evidence for this 
bowl being with Dhrowpathi and Manimekalai.

1152
01:28:16,005 --> 01:28:20,433
But there is no proof of it 
being with Jesus and Nabigal.

1153
01:28:23,020 --> 01:28:24,166
Don’t know.

1154
01:28:24,295 --> 01:28:27,671
But they have stated in every religion that 
there has been many wonders done in food.

1155
01:28:27,787 --> 01:28:30,720
But, none has explained how that food came.

1156
01:28:32,496 --> 01:28:36,980
That’s why they had kept that 
bowl with a different name.

1157
01:28:37,201 --> 01:28:41,601
All these are my grandpa’s clues. 
Can’t say these are 100% right.

1158
01:28:42,728 --> 01:28:46,629
Who possessed that bowl 
is not important for us.

1159
01:28:47,067 --> 01:28:49,556
How are we going to find that? 
That’s important.

1160
01:28:49,701 --> 01:28:52,367
Without knowing anything how to find it?

1161
01:28:53,863 --> 01:28:56,236
I don’t get it too.

1162
01:28:57,776 --> 01:29:01,095
We are missing some clue.

1163
01:29:48,304 --> 01:29:50,415
How did you find that 
it is in Kanchipuram?

1164
01:29:51,021 --> 01:29:54,726
All the files in the memory card 
has a tamil word at the end.

1165
01:29:55,296 --> 01:29:57,625
This is known as the Anagram

1166
01:29:58,327 --> 01:30:02,750
i.e a word formed by rearranging 
the letters of another

1167
01:30:03,108 --> 01:30:07,174
After rearranging those letters 
I got this word Kanchipuram.

1168
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:11,866
Okay. Where is that tunnel in Kanchipuram?

1169
01:30:12,135 --> 01:30:15,294
Thiruvadanthai. The pallava 
king has constructed a subway

1170
01:30:15,387 --> 01:30:18,514
from Mahabalipuram to NithyaPerumal 
temple in Thiruvadanthai.

1171
01:30:18,541 --> 01:30:19,753
They say it still exists.

1172
01:30:39,903 --> 01:30:41,636
Bro i’ll bring the jerkin.

1173
01:30:49,367 --> 01:30:52,404
Why are they visiting ancient temples?

1174
01:30:54,521 --> 01:30:57,254
They are simply walking away after that.

1175
01:30:58,029 --> 01:31:00,229
If I shut and go I’ll get caught.

1176
01:31:01,601 --> 01:31:06,401
Without looking at the Gods in temple 
why are they looking at the walls?

1177
01:31:10,767 --> 01:31:13,090
So is this that subway?

1178
01:31:14,061 --> 01:31:16,390
Why are we waiting. Come let’s break in.

1179
01:31:16,444 --> 01:31:20,599
We are in public. Can’t break in. 
Have to search for some other way.

1180
01:31:23,146 --> 01:31:25,277
He’s right.

1181
01:31:25,927 --> 01:31:28,936
All the secret pathways 
will be 10feet from the ground level.

1182
01:31:29,161 --> 01:31:32,795
Let’s walk for a kilometer and check. 
There wont be any people in that place.

1183
01:31:32,843 --> 01:31:35,843
Let’s dig in a 10 feet 
pit and let’s move in.

1184
01:31:37,613 --> 01:31:39,021
What do you guys say?

1185
01:31:39,071 --> 01:31:40,071
Lets go.

1186
01:31:42,984 --> 01:31:47,450
They are roaming around forests, 
mountains and all the hilly areas

1187
01:31:51,199 --> 01:31:53,866
They have planned to do something here.

1188
01:32:06,413 --> 01:32:11,080
Wait. We both will go inside because 
we need your help when we come up

1189
01:32:19,277 --> 01:32:21,859
What is this man. The pit is so deep. 
It’s ok. Let’s jump

1190
01:32:21,895 --> 01:32:23,337
Sudharsa, put some insurance for me.

1191
01:32:23,362 --> 01:32:25,726
What is this. They are 
jumping in one by one!

1192
01:32:26,100 --> 01:32:27,956
But he’s standing alone outside.

1193
01:32:27,981 --> 01:32:31,180
Akhil.. Where are you?

1194
01:32:31,985 --> 01:32:33,651
Here only. Where are you.

1195
01:32:35,188 --> 01:32:37,099
Switch on the torch.

1196
01:32:50,732 --> 01:32:53,799
Will they come back? 
Will I get my taxi money?

1197
01:33:02,657 --> 01:33:07,172
Hello. I’m not able to go in. 
How will i follow them?

1198
01:33:07,236 --> 01:33:11,757
Don’t go. I’ll tell you when 
the time comes. Wait till then.

1199
01:33:17,257 --> 01:33:18,724
Come lets take a look.

1200
01:33:21,630 --> 01:33:23,163
Hey it’s our Gothandam.

1201
01:33:23,188 --> 01:33:24,588
How did he come here?

1202
01:33:24,971 --> 01:33:26,537
May be he came by air

1203
01:33:28,832 --> 01:33:31,965
We can spare our taxi fare then. 
Come let’s go.

1204
01:33:34,270 --> 01:33:36,610
I thought they would 
come running to help me

1205
01:33:36,635 --> 01:33:38,330
But they are walking away at the same pace

1206
01:33:38,381 --> 01:33:40,181
Hey guys wait let me come.

1207
01:34:49,731 --> 01:34:51,664
Woahh.. Beautiful paintings.

1208
01:34:53,476 --> 01:34:58,373
Hey akhi we are not sure of 
those clues are there in here.

1209
01:34:58,996 --> 01:35:00,435
Why do we need to strain ourselves?

1210
01:35:00,493 --> 01:35:02,426
I have a hunch. It’s in here.

1211
01:35:03,424 --> 01:35:04,424
Come let’s go.

1212
01:35:34,065 --> 01:35:35,665
Hey Akhil, the swan man!

1213
01:35:35,794 --> 01:35:38,462
It’s the swan only na. 
Not the anaconda right.

1214
01:35:42,470 --> 01:35:48,989
The dried up sands in the Arms Warehouse. 
The tree between these two.

1215
01:35:50,874 --> 01:35:55,113
Surya the first clue that 
we got is this swan right?

1216
01:35:55,825 --> 01:35:58,325
But what’s the realtion between these two?

1217
01:35:59,638 --> 01:36:03,238
That bowl.. It was in the 
sithanavasal painting right?

1218
01:36:04,193 --> 01:36:05,740
That is the Akshaya Paatiram.

1219
01:36:05,802 --> 01:36:08,100
But the tomb above that and the Nandhi 
statue.

1220
01:36:09,422 --> 01:36:10,880
I don’t understand anything. Can I say?

1221
01:36:10,904 --> 01:36:11,872
What?

1222
01:36:11,963 --> 01:36:12,969
It’s the Tanjore Temple.

1223
01:36:12,994 --> 01:36:13,998
How are you saying?

1224
01:36:14,023 --> 01:36:15,818
Once I went for a pick up there.

1225
01:36:15,861 --> 01:36:19,051
That guy got down and told me to 
look at the temple tomb carefully.

1226
01:36:19,076 --> 01:36:21,676
I was looking at that and he ran away.

1227
01:36:22,161 --> 01:36:24,095
Even we are going to do that.

1228
01:36:24,966 --> 01:36:27,928
Hey Akhil, where are we going next?

1229
01:36:30,787 --> 01:36:31,787
Tanjore

1230
01:36:42,894 --> 01:36:44,028
Where in Tanjore?

1231
01:36:45,486 --> 01:36:47,473
First to temple.

1232
01:36:47,537 --> 01:36:48,982
There are many things in that temple.

1233
01:36:49,890 --> 01:36:50,890
What?

1234
01:36:51,274 --> 01:36:56,141
The height of the tomb is 216ft. In 
Tamil the consonantal vowels is 216.

1235
01:36:56,345 --> 01:37:00,515
Lord Siva’s statue height is 18ft. 
In Tamil, the consonants count is 18.

1236
01:37:00,860 --> 01:37:03,561
And the distance between Lord 
Shiva and Nandhi is 244.

1237
01:37:03,746 --> 01:37:06,164
In tamil,if we add the arithmetic 
character, the total word count is 244

1238
01:37:06,189 --> 01:37:08,589
Raja raja cholan loves Tamil a lot.

1239
01:37:09,132 --> 01:37:12,532
So he kept the base of 
tamil and built that temple.

1240
01:37:12,801 --> 01:37:15,095
Okay.. Is there anything that 
relates our treasure and this temple?

1241
01:37:15,120 --> 01:37:15,978
Don’t know Surya.

1242
01:37:18,322 --> 01:37:19,822
But in this painting

1243
01:37:19,847 --> 01:37:23,659
‘The dried up sands in the Arms 
Warehouse.The tree between these two’

1244
01:37:24,028 --> 01:37:29,554
You do onething. Search for any 
ancient arms warehouse in Tanjore.

1245
01:37:37,224 --> 01:37:40,484
I checked. It’s Azhamparai in Tanjore.

1246
01:37:40,509 --> 01:37:43,230
It was built for the army of the 
Raja Raja Cholan during his period.

1247
01:37:55,642 --> 01:37:59,709
This is the Army Warehouse 
during Raja Raja Cholan’s period.

1248
01:38:02,606 --> 01:38:04,073
What should we search here?

1249
01:38:04,974 --> 01:38:07,583
No idea. But here below this 
painting they have mentioned

1250
01:38:07,608 --> 01:38:11,725
“It resides where the 
bricks and the trees meet”

1251
01:38:11,750 --> 01:38:13,322
Mankatti means bricks only right?

1252
01:38:13,434 --> 01:38:14,434
Hmm.. yeah..

1253
01:38:16,052 --> 01:38:22,218
we need find the place where the tree 
and the briks meet around this castle

1254
01:38:25,543 --> 01:38:30,144
The place is so vast. I’ll go this way.

1255
01:38:30,169 --> 01:38:33,435
You guys go that way. 
Let’s see what we can find.

1256
01:39:43,598 --> 01:39:45,331
Hey how did you come here?

1257
01:39:45,428 --> 01:39:46,895
Hey i came to pee man.

1258
01:39:47,935 --> 01:39:49,333
Oye this is that ancient tree.

1259
01:39:50,137 --> 01:39:52,532
Yeah there’s the brick stones near it too.

1260
01:39:52,768 --> 01:39:54,061
So where should we dig?

1261
01:39:55,298 --> 01:39:56,538
Dig till you find something

1262
01:40:19,770 --> 01:40:23,621
Hey what is that? Take it carefully. 
Look at it.

1263
01:40:24,523 --> 01:40:27,485
It looks like some poem written 
in the palm leaf bundle.

1264
01:40:28,044 --> 01:40:29,311
Yeah it is a poem.

1265
01:40:32,100 --> 01:40:34,143
All these are poems man. 
(tamil poetic lines)

1266
01:40:51,079 --> 01:40:55,545
According to this poem, the next 
place we need to visit is Kovalam.

1267
01:40:56,255 --> 01:40:58,522
Oh. Is it? What else is mentioned?

1268
01:41:00,617 --> 01:41:08,537
(tamil poetic lines)

1269
01:41:09,246 --> 01:41:10,913
Akhil, we have found out.

1270
01:41:12,278 --> 01:41:15,870
Akhil, Next we need to go to Kovalam. 
Come let’s go.

1271
01:41:17,278 --> 01:41:19,478
Hey... Why don’t you look happy..

1272
01:41:20,160 --> 01:41:22,894
Yeah.. Right.. It’s ok. Come let’s leave.

1273
01:41:24,460 --> 01:41:27,094
Wait. Why are you so curious?

1274
01:41:27,310 --> 01:41:29,282
It’s because of the girl yaar.. Sneha..

1275
01:41:29,405 --> 01:41:33,103
They are torturing us na? Come let’s leave.

1276
01:41:33,248 --> 01:41:34,893
Then who’s this?

1277
01:41:56,394 --> 01:41:58,709
Sneha how come you are here?

1278
01:42:00,052 --> 01:42:01,198
Please pardon me Akhil.

1279
01:42:02,362 --> 01:42:04,379
It was 
Sudharsan who asked to act me like this.

1280
01:42:05,170 --> 01:42:08,291
Hey.. How come you are here?

1281
01:42:09,217 --> 01:42:10,617
No one kidnapped me.

1282
01:42:13,524 --> 01:42:14,524
Hello

1283
01:42:15,227 --> 01:42:17,160
Hello Sneha.. It’s Sudharsan.

1284
01:42:17,863 --> 01:42:20,929
Tell me Sudharsan.. How’s 
everything going on?

1285
01:42:21,028 --> 01:42:24,900
Yeah all good. Can you 
check your account please?

1286
01:42:26,284 --> 01:42:28,664
Account huh? Wait..

1287
01:42:36,685 --> 01:42:40,330
Yeah.. 1 lakhs rupees has been 
transferred to my account. How?

1288
01:42:40,850 --> 01:42:41,988
This is just the beginning.

1289
01:42:42,649 --> 01:42:44,809
Even I 
didn’t understand it at the start.

1290
01:42:45,415 --> 01:42:49,281
If we help them in this plan 
we will get 10 crore rupees.

1291
01:42:50,149 --> 01:42:55,349
Akhil denied to go in search of the 
treasure stating some sentimental issues.

1292
01:42:57,283 --> 01:43:01,713
Just because of money your 
marriage was cancelled

1293
01:43:02,846 --> 01:43:07,854
If you help in this plan, we 
can change Akhil’s status.

1294
01:43:08,490 --> 01:43:09,557
What do you say?

1295
01:43:09,618 --> 01:43:11,018
What should I do now?

1296
01:43:16,780 --> 01:43:18,771
You have backstabbed me man! Traitor!

1297
01:43:18,980 --> 01:43:22,846
Akhil, they threatened me. 
I didn’t know what else to do.

1298
01:43:22,961 --> 01:43:24,695
Hey what’s happening here?

1299
01:43:24,808 --> 01:43:25,808
Ask him.

1300
01:43:25,839 --> 01:43:27,239
What did you do yaar?

1301
01:43:28,767 --> 01:43:32,300
Come on speak. I thought 
you were my dearest friend.

1302
01:43:32,589 --> 01:43:34,923
Why did you do like this? 
Tell me.

1303
01:43:35,620 --> 01:43:36,620
Leave him dude.

1304
01:43:38,785 --> 01:43:43,852
Stop it. It is right when you search 
for the treasure for your selfishness.

1305
01:43:45,957 --> 01:43:48,049
Sudharsan has been caught red handed.

1306
01:43:48,478 --> 01:43:50,478
Did we do all these for money?

1307
01:43:50,503 --> 01:43:53,303
No. But did you do it to save your lives?

1308
01:43:53,531 --> 01:43:55,367
There is selfishness in this too right?

1309
01:43:56,252 --> 01:43:58,174
You have the wish to 
find the treasure right?

1310
01:43:58,600 --> 01:44:00,405
Is that not the love for money?

1311
01:44:00,430 --> 01:44:03,436
It’s right when you do, 
and wrong when I do. Is it?

1312
01:44:03,853 --> 01:44:06,760
Understand. I didn’t 
want anything to happen,

1313
01:44:06,785 --> 01:44:09,806
that’s why i gave him little information. 
That’s all.

1314
01:44:11,315 --> 01:44:14,927
Oh is it? That’s all huh?

1315
01:44:15,897 --> 01:44:19,609
Then what is this?

1316
01:44:24,046 --> 01:44:29,294
Akhil.. Look even your friend becomes 
a traitor when it comes to money.

1317
01:44:29,678 --> 01:44:31,621
Let’s see who wins man.

1318
01:44:31,737 --> 01:44:34,880
I’m going alone to destroy the next clue. 
Stop me if you can.

1319
01:44:37,590 --> 01:44:38,590
Hey come..

1320
01:44:39,217 --> 01:44:41,071
Get lost man.

1321
01:44:51,453 --> 01:44:55,720
Akhil has gone out of our way. 
We need to call our big brother.

1322
01:45:03,932 --> 01:45:05,880
Akhil what are we going to do next?

1323
01:45:06,365 --> 01:45:07,839
They shouldn’t get the treasure.

1324
01:45:07,931 --> 01:45:10,731
We need to something immediately for that.

1325
01:45:11,081 --> 01:45:12,214
No need for that.

1326
01:45:15,792 --> 01:45:16,954
Sir, you?

1327
01:45:16,987 --> 01:45:19,319
Yeah I belong to zhagaram.

1328
01:45:19,706 --> 01:45:23,106
I know they will follow 
you after your grandfather.

1329
01:45:23,311 --> 01:45:25,886
That’s why I warned you in the office.

1330
01:45:26,615 --> 01:45:28,036
You didn’t pay heed to it.

1331
01:45:28,061 --> 01:45:29,861
That was when I met Sneha.

1332
01:45:30,955 --> 01:45:33,629
I know you will come in 
search of the treasure.

1333
01:45:34,234 --> 01:45:37,501
So we decided to get hold 
of him with your help.

1334
01:45:37,526 --> 01:45:40,493
But now there’s no need for that.

1335
01:45:41,269 --> 01:45:42,269
Why?

1336
01:45:42,294 --> 01:45:43,848
He should be alive for that.

1337
01:45:55,417 --> 01:45:56,534
Hello..

1338
01:45:57,171 --> 01:45:59,557
Brother, Akhil has found out the truth.

1339
01:45:59,631 --> 01:46:00,675
What should we do now?

1340
01:46:00,700 --> 01:46:02,900
You have shattered all my plans.

1341
01:46:02,925 --> 01:46:05,391
Can’t you do a single work properly.

1342
01:46:06,076 --> 01:46:09,335
You take your salary and leave.

1343
01:46:11,596 --> 01:46:14,050
Is that all? We need a 
fight scene in the movie na?

1344
01:46:14,559 --> 01:46:16,287
Every movie has a fight scene sir.

1345
01:46:16,345 --> 01:46:19,004
So if it goes like this, our 
movie will be different sir.

1346
01:46:19,124 --> 01:46:21,277
What bro. How can a movie 
be without a fight scene?

1347
01:46:24,119 --> 01:46:26,305
We definitely need a fight in our movie.

1348
01:46:26,457 --> 01:46:29,465
The audience will expect it dude. 
Commercial movie..

1349
01:46:29,490 --> 01:46:32,236
Since the time of MGR the custom 
has been songs, dance, and fight

1350
01:46:32,271 --> 01:46:33,275
They are asking for it.

1351
01:46:33,447 --> 01:46:35,822
Our movie has everything except fight.

1352
01:46:36,150 --> 01:46:38,617
Let’s keep a fight scene. We have to.

1353
01:46:39,027 --> 01:46:41,699
Ok sir. Let’s keep a fight 
scene like your wish.

1354
01:46:41,946 --> 01:46:44,561
At the climax, as usual hero and 
villian gets into a fight sir.

1355
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:47,915
Villian as usual shoots 
him with a thousand bullets

1356
01:46:47,982 --> 01:46:50,008
but not even a single bullet hits the hero.

1357
01:46:50,719 --> 01:46:53,586
But our hero, shoots with only one bullet.

1358
01:46:53,611 --> 01:46:55,896
It hits him in the forehead 
and he’s dead on the spot.

1359
01:46:56,591 --> 01:47:00,821
Finally our hero saves as per the justice.

1360
01:47:01,374 --> 01:47:03,638
How is he? Is he narrating 
an interesting story?

1361
01:47:03,663 --> 01:47:05,483
When can we arrange the 
functions for the movie sir?

1362
01:47:05,508 --> 01:47:06,816
Let’s do it in the coming week.

1363
01:47:07,140 --> 01:47:08,340
I’m glad brother.

1364
01:47:08,519 --> 01:47:09,652
Ok thank you sir.

1365
01:47:14,243 --> 01:47:16,729
What is this yaar. He’s asking 
us to end with the usual climax?

1366
01:47:16,754 --> 01:47:20,496
Hmmm the blue shirt which he wore 
is the reason for everything.

1367
01:47:20,692 --> 01:47:21,699
Blue shirt huh?

1368
01:47:22,285 --> 01:47:25,808
Yeah.. People will tend to think all 
weird things if they wear blue shirt.

1369
01:47:25,997 --> 01:47:28,950
Okay tell me the climax.

1370
01:47:37,149 --> 01:47:41,059
I myself will go and get 
that Akshayapaatiram.

1371
01:47:46,604 --> 01:47:49,495
The one who was behind us is dead

1372
01:47:49,824 --> 01:47:51,894
Now should we be scared for the murderer?

1373
01:47:52,157 --> 01:47:53,761
Zhagaram will take care of everything.

1374
01:47:53,786 --> 01:47:58,068
Sir what is this zhagaram organisation? 
Who are they? Who created those clues?

1375
01:47:58,844 --> 01:48:01,130
Zhagaram is a huge network.

1376
01:48:01,654 --> 01:48:03,162
Many people 
are involved in this.

1377
01:48:03,187 --> 01:48:04,634
Why should the treasure be kept in hiding?

1378
01:48:04,659 --> 01:48:06,593
Everything here is a secret.

1379
01:48:06,618 --> 01:48:09,062
Because, if they get to know about this,

1380
01:48:09,369 --> 01:48:13,320
they will fight among 
themselves first to possess it.

1381
01:48:13,912 --> 01:48:16,112
Then it will be among the nations

1382
01:48:16,508 --> 01:48:19,441
This earth wouldn’t bear another World War.

1383
01:48:19,791 --> 01:48:23,124
If the treasure comes out, 
destruction is for sure

1384
01:48:23,149 --> 01:48:29,420
But now, we are in a 
stage to keep that safe.

1385
01:48:30,129 --> 01:48:34,945
In the coming 30 to 40 years the 
world will face a huge poverty

1386
01:48:35,866 --> 01:48:39,699
Without rains, without water, 
without food,

1387
01:48:40,133 --> 01:48:42,010
everyone will struggle.

1388
01:48:42,455 --> 01:48:46,399
A situation will come when humans will 
start killing each other to feed on them.

1389
01:48:47,402 --> 01:48:52,536
To save all this, the only 
solution is Akshayapaatiram.

1390
01:48:53,383 --> 01:48:55,650
Whatever, our work is over right?

1391
01:48:55,687 --> 01:48:58,220
We won’t be in trouble anymore right?

1392
01:48:58,670 --> 01:49:01,529
Over huh? Haha.. The game just begins.

1393
01:49:01,749 --> 01:49:02,749
Akhil,

1394
01:49:03,612 --> 01:49:07,546
the path which you crossed so 
far wasn’t just a coincidence

1395
01:49:07,917 --> 01:49:09,474
Since the time you were born,

1396
01:49:09,864 --> 01:49:12,730
there was a shadow 
which had followed you.

1397
01:49:12,937 --> 01:49:14,071
That is zhagaram.

1398
01:49:14,934 --> 01:49:17,548
What is the relation between 
you and this treasure?

1399
01:49:18,195 --> 01:49:20,342
Why these many people are protecting you?

1400
01:49:20,564 --> 01:49:23,721
And many are wishing to kill you?

1401
01:49:24,126 --> 01:49:27,257
What is the relation between 
you and the five Pandavas?

1402
01:49:27,282 --> 01:49:30,611
Or what is the realtion between 
you and Raja Raja Cholan?

1403
01:49:31,168 --> 01:49:32,168
Who are you?

1404
01:49:33,032 --> 01:49:35,658
If you need the answers 
for all these questions,

1405
01:49:36,117 --> 01:49:40,579
you must go to the place where 
this Akshayapaatiram is hid.

1406
01:49:41,138 --> 01:49:42,138
Where?

1407
01:49:42,230 --> 01:49:43,230
Kumari Kandam.

1408
01:49:43,783 --> 01:49:46,527
The moment the first human 
was born on this earth,

1409
01:49:46,552 --> 01:49:49,952
the Tamil language and the 
Tamil culture was born.

1410
01:49:50,276 --> 01:49:54,654
The place where the first 
human is believed to be born,

1411
01:49:55,112 --> 01:49:58,146
is Kumarigandam, the place which 
was under the rule of Pandavas.

1412
01:49:58,171 --> 01:50:02,466
land of rich prolific mountains and 
rivers and that had 41 countires together

1413
01:50:02,709 --> 01:50:09,418
Kumarigandam is now 
submerged under the oceans?

1414
01:50:11,385 --> 01:50:14,315
Our Kumari land was once widespread 
which includes the different nations

1415
01:50:14,340 --> 01:50:18,339
like India, Sri Lanka, 
Australia and Africa.

1416
01:50:21,085 --> 01:50:26,638
For the past 9990 years, the place where 
the 3 Tamil organizations originated,

1417
01:50:26,845 --> 01:50:30,045
the place where many 
famous literary works like

1418
01:50:30,070 --> 01:50:32,949
Thirukkural, Tholkaappiyam 
originated is Kumarigandam.

1419
01:50:32,987 --> 01:50:34,843
The refereances about this land has 
been there in many literary works

1420
01:50:34,935 --> 01:50:39,928
Silapathigaram, Iraiyanar agaporul, 
Kanthapuraanam and Thiruvilaiyaadal Puranam.

1421
01:50:39,973 --> 01:50:42,203
The things that we haven’t heard 
so far, haven’t seen so far

1422
01:50:42,250 --> 01:50:43,613
the things which are 
beyond our imagination like

1423
01:50:43,744 --> 01:50:50,378
sculptures, mahals, temples, buildings 
wonders are hidden there in that land

1424
01:50:50,628 --> 01:50:56,533
Above all, the Aksayapaatiram which 
has been protected since centuries,

1425
01:50:56,733 --> 01:50:59,188
is now awaiting our arrival.

1426
01:50:59,722 --> 01:51:02,711
Come let’s visit the submerged 
lands under the oceans

1427
01:51:02,736 --> 01:51:06,207
learn about the lives of our 
ancestors and recover many treasures.

1428
01:51:11,634 --> 01:51:15,594
That’s the place where the Sun and 
the moon meets at the same plane.

1429
01:51:16,199 --> 01:51:17,266
Give that Surya.

1430
01:51:18,874 --> 01:51:26,263
(tamil poetic lyrics)

1431
01:51:43,479 --> 01:51:47,004
Oh, so in the second part you are going to 
the Kumarigandam in search of the treasure.

1432
01:51:47,650 --> 01:51:51,850
The entrance to the kumarigandam is 
where the oceans will split open.

1433
01:51:51,940 --> 01:51:54,451
Movie is awesome man. 
Definitely it will be a hit.

1434
01:51:55,048 --> 01:51:59,048
Whatever man. I was able to do 
only this much with 10lakhs.
