1
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,560
All passengers travelling to Doha

2
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,960
are requested
to go through security.

3
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,480
Are you a housemaid?

4
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,400
Even I hold a work visa
of a house maid.

5
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,760
I have been doing this job
for six years.

6
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,160
But when I got tired of working as
a housemaid, I left to my native.

7
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:41,520
But because of my financial
problems, I came back.

8
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,280
People think that we have a good
time working in Saudi Arabia.

9
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,880
What's your name?

10
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,040
Aswathi.

11
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,480
When you reach your employer's
house, they will change your name.

12
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,360
They'll call you
with different names.

13
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,360
Or else, they'll address you
as the housemaid.

14
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,560
Where is your native place?

15
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,880
It's near Pattambi.

16
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,040
My native place is at Kondotty.
When did you reach here?

17
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,320
This morning.

18
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,080
Does your sponsor
know that you are here?

19
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,120
Before I took the flight, Usman,
who sent me the visa, had called.

20
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,480
He said that he'd come to the
airport along with the sponsor.

21
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,400
They will come, but
only when they feel like.

22
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,400
Sometimes, we have to wait
for days here.

23
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,360
That's what happens here.

24
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,520
I don't know when my
sponsor will be here.

25
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,960
'Flight number SV535..'
- Come on

26
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,120
Let's sit there.
- '...has arrived.'

27
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,480
All passengers travelling..

28
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,000
'Flight number SV562
to Dubai..'

29
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,640
Even they are housemaids.
They are from different countries.

30
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,080
Now you are one of us.

31
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,600
You cannot roam around

32
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,680
in this outfit in Saudi
once you go out of the airport.

33
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,400
You must cover your head
even if you're not a Muslim.

34
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,600
It's a law in this country. Here,
cover your head with this stole.

35
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,640
And wipe off that bindi
from your forehead.

36
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,720
'KHADDAMA'

37
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,840
Don't hurry. Look carefully.

38
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,840
The police found this
body near the road

39
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,240
that goes from Riyadh to Dammam.

40
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,240
We didn't find any ID on him.

41
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,960
But if we can find his address

42
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,680
we can send his
body to his family.

43
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,480
I think it's about three
months now, right? - Yes.

44
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,040
There's a tattoo on his left arm
which spells out as 'Ram' in Hindi.

45
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,680
That's how they confirmed
that he's an Indian.

46
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,840
No matter if you
are from Bengal, UP or Bihar

47
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,080
if you remain unidentified
after your death

48
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,560
the authorities here
would call you an unknown Indian.

49
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,880
When I saw his photo,
I thought I knew him.

50
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,240
But the guy I knew
had a mole under his nose.

51
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,400
But he doesn't have a mole.

52
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,640
Are you sure about that mole?

53
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,720
Why can't you take a clear look?

54
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,920
If this guy doesn't have a mole,
why should I waste my time?

55
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,920
Razak, you own a shop here.

56
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,360
Don't waste your time
on these things

57
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,280
that don't benefit you.

58
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,560
If nobody claims the body, then
the hospital will bury it.

59
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,920
That's right. But there
must be some family

60
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,480
waiting for this guy
and the money he sends.

61
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,000
And if they don't get
any news about him

62
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,720
they'll curse him

63
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,280
thinking that he forgot his family
and is living a good life here.

64
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:37,640
I don't want anyone
cursing him, Ramesh.

65
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,000
Come fast. I can't risk
my job because of you.

66
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,720
The company called me twice.

67
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,240
It's time to deliver the next load.

68
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,360
Did someone identify the body?
- No.

69
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,200
He just needed a mole.
- What?

70
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,080
A guy came to identify his body.

71
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,880
But he was looking
for a guy with a mole.

72
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,280
Razak.. Just wait.

73
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,960
I guess you recognise
that body now. Am I right?

74
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,080
No, I don't care
whose dead body is that.

75
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,800
It cost me 150 riyal to come
here from Dammam in a cab.

76
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,160
You'll have to pay me that money.

77
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,720
150 riyal?

78
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,800
The cab is not mine, Razak.

79
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,080
I have the photo

80
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,520
of that dead body.

81
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,320
I'll let you know if anyone
recognises the body. Bye. - Okay.

82
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,160
Are you happy with your loss?

83
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,400
It's okay. I'm not
worried about the cash.

84
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,720
I can tell that.

85
00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:00,240
Razak, we are working here
to earn money.

86
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,320
Why are you wasting the money meant
for your family on other people?

87
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,920
I don't understand what
happiness one gets

88
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,080
by thinking about only
oneself and his family.

89
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,720
Fine. I won't argue with you.
You're not going to change.

90
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,520
My mom's returning to Kerala today.
I forgot about that.

91
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,480
Hello. - Dear.

92
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,000
Mother-in-law is waiting
since morning.

93
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,440
Your absence is making
her restless.

94
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,640
When are you coming home?

95
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,640
Are you planning
to come at the last moment?

96
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,360
I'm on my way, Serena.

97
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,600
You tell her to be
a little patient.

98
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,440
Salim will be there now.

99
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,400
Just come fast. - Give me.

100
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,800
Razak.

101
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,160
One of our relatives
wanted a holy book.

102
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,320
I forgot to buy it.
Please buy it for me.

103
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,040
And buy some fresh dates as well.

104
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,480
Jamila told me to bring

105
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,880
something from Saudi Arabia.

106
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,360
Okay, mom. I'll get it.

107
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,960
Okay. I want you to reach home

108
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,080
as soon as possible.

109
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,920
Just hurry.

110
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:15,120
I can at least spend
some more time with you.

111
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,320
I'll be there soon.

112
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,520
Varghese. - Yes. - Let's go
through the Friday market. - Okay.

113
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,120
Hello. Where? Which site?

114
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,240
Okay, I'll be there.
I'll come there right away.

115
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,200
Varghese. - Yes.

116
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,760
Don't go
through the Friday market.

117
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,880
Go to Sana. - Why?

118
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,520
An accident happened
at the construction site there.

119
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,960
A man is in a critical stage.

120
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,920
Let's have a look there
and then we can go.

121
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,160
But we..
- We still have lots of time.

122
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,360
Oh, God!

123
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,680
Oh, God..

124
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,600
What happened?
- We are in trouble, Razak.

125
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,320
We can't even help
people nowadays.

126
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,640
What happened?
- He fell from the ladder.

127
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,240
Oh, dear Lord..

128
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,560
These people will kill me today.

129
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,400
I can't endure the pain.

130
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,720
Get him to the hospital now.

131
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,240
He doesn't have a passport
or work permit.

132
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,440
We'll get into trouble
if we go with him.

133
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,480
You have good contacts in the
hospital and with the police.

134
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,040
Razak, don't get
involved in this.

135
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,600
We are going to the airport.
Let's go. Come.

136
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,680
How did he get here
without any documents?

137
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,240
We just helped him, Razak.

138
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,280
When we don't
have enough workers

139
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,960
we call workers from outside.

140
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,440
He didn't have a passport
or a work permit.

141
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,880
But still, we helped him,
so that he can earn something.

142
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,160
I had told them that I feel dizzy
when I climb.

143
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,720
But they didn't believe me.

144
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,800
What's his name?
- Chand Basha.

145
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,600
Please, take me to a hospital.

146
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,040
If we take care of him now,
what about your mom?

147
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,080
Stop talking and help him.

148
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,520
Take him..

149
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,160
He'll need an X-ray and scanning.
He broke his back.

150
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,680
My leg..

151
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,200
Razak never listens to me.

152
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,280
Why can't you stay
for some more days?

153
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,720
Because I have to take
care of the goats there.

154
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,800
I handed my job to Jamila
while coming here.

155
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,360
I can't always do that.

156
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,400
Dad never comes on time.
He is always late.

157
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,760
He's more concerned
about others than his own family.

158
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,880
Even his father was like that.

159
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,160
He always used to do
others' work first.

160
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,160
But this is not our state. We
can't do anything we want here.

161
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,600
He took ten years to fulfil his
promise of taking you to Hajj.

162
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,360
He delays in family matters.

163
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,440
Thank God. Finally,
he brought me here.

164
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,120
We should be happy.

165
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,640
Please tie up this box, Salim.

166
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,040
I can't do it properly.

167
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,440
The flight is at 7 o'clock, right?
- Yes.

168
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,560
Serena, is it okay if I
drop her to the airport?

169
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,800
I don't think Razak
will be here on time.

170
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,200
There might be a big
queue of people

171
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,480
who are returning
after visiting Hajj.

172
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,320
I'll tell Razak to come
directly to the airport.

173
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,360
Be quiet, Salim.

174
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,000
I won't leave until
Razak comes back.

175
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,960
I am serious.

176
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,520
I don't care if I miss the flight.

177
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,280
Can I go now? - Okay.

178
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,240
Did you get all the things, Salim?

179
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,360
Your mother said that she wouldn't
leave until you arrive.

180
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,960
Keep this as well.

181
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,720
All his money gets spent
on helping others.

182
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,480
He doesn't save any money at all.

183
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,040
It's been years since he's planning
to build a house of our own.

184
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,960
Dad said that he'd build a house

185
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,880
before the next rainy season.
- Be quiet.

186
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,560
Eight rainy seasons have passed by.
Did he do anything yet?

187
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,720
You will get a house, Serena.

188
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,640
Please don't complain
about him all the time.

189
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,760
Mom is about to leave.

190
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,240
And you are still complaining
to her about me, Serena.

191
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,080
Nobody is complaining
about you, dear.

192
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,200
She says it
because she loves you.

193
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,360
Of course. But she calculates
my love for her

194
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,800
on the basis of the pace at which
I construct our house.

195
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,240
If I try to get
that work done faster

196
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,560
she feels I love her.

197
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,400
Am I right, Serena?

198
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,320
It's already late. You
should leave now.

199
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,840
We can discuss love later.
Come, Mother-in-law.

200
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,160
Don't forget to meet
Dr. Damodaran. - Okay.

201
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,320
And check your B.P
and diabetes. Let's go.

202
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:22,200
Let me see you once again
before leaving.

203
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,920
I don't know
when I'll see you again.

204
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,880
Mom, please don't start crying now.
Or else I'll start crying too.

205
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,040
Please come.

206
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,480
Hey. - Praise the Lord.

207
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,120
Praise the Lord.
You are here early, Mr. Hamsa.

208
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,680
What happened, dear?

209
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,160
I'm going to the embassy today.
Soon your problem will be solved.

210
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,720
That Arab sponsor betrayed him.

211
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,600
I know him. He won't
cheat anybody.

212
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,560
We know that,
but the law doesn't.

213
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,760
Even after working
here for 30 years

214
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,040
when our situation didn't improve

215
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,800
I called my son here to help me.
But look what happened now.

216
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,120
My son is behind bars now.

217
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,160
Some people at the
embassy will help us.

218
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,320
Rasheed will be released soon.

219
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,960
You are helping us a lot.

220
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,720
I know you'll need some money.

221
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,800
This is all I have.

222
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,680
If I had collected money for these
works, I would've become rich.

223
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,000
Please keep it with you.

224
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,880
Please get him something to drink.

225
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,160
No, Razak.

226
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,960
I'm not in a mood
for snacks and drinks.

227
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,040
The stocks are about to get over.
Our last payment is still pending.

228
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,040
We'll pay that. Now get me
a recharge coupon for 100 riyal.

229
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,400
You can't ignore your shop's
responsibilities like this, Razak.

230
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,960
You know what happened
with Datta's shop.

231
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,120
I hope your shop doesn't
get shut like his shop.

232
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,920
Don't blame us then.

233
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,080
Even to spend on other people,
you'll have to earn money.

234
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,080
I'll be fine. Not just one.

235
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,720
I want two coupons for 100 riyal.

236
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,440
It's no use anyway. You
will finish it by evening

237
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,120
by making calls for other
people's needs.

238
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,040
Such a waste.

239
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,960
How is it?

240
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,080
What's this, Ajith?

241
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,720
This is not the news
I informed you about.

242
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,280
This looks like a detective novel.

243
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,960
If we don't make the news
a little interesting

244
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,480
nobody will read it, Razak.

245
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,760
People aren't interested to read
real life stories now.

246
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,160
I know. It's true that people who
get tired of writing stories

247
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,160
and novels, become journalists.

248
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,800
Why do you play with the lives
of these poor people

249
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,200
on the basis of your doubts
and assumptions?

250
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,400
In the news about Surendran
from Cherthala

251
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,720
who got arrested
for attacking his sponsor

252
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,080
you wrote that the sponsor
suspected that Surendran

253
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,320
was having an affair with his wife
and that led to the fight.

254
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,200
Look where that matter
has reached. - Well..

255
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,280
For you it's nothing.

256
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,160
Now even if Surendran
comes out of the jail and goes home

257
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,520
he can't live with his wife.
That innocent guy's wife left him.

258
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,240
Hey, that's interesting.
But that story

259
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,840
is valuable only on the day
when he gets out of jail.

260
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,160
If I stay here any longer

261
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,240
you'll make news about me too.

262
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,800
I should leave before that.

263
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,360
Hey, wait. There's one more news.

264
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,760
I wanted to show you
before I publish it.

265
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,240
It's about a housemaid in Buraydah.

266
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,400
We've been reported
that she escaped

267
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,920
from there two days ago,
with gold and money.

268
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,320
Look. Do you recognise her?

269
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,040
Aswathi. Have you heard about her?

270
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,040
No.
- She's beautiful.

271
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,480
A typical Malayalee girl
from Kerala. - Yes.

272
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,560
She doesn't look
like she can steal.

273
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,280
The climate of a desert
and the nature of man is the same.

274
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,160
It can change anytime, Ajith.

275
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,960
You are right.

276
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,400
There's no scope
of creating a story

277
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,000
using just a passport
and her profile.

278
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,240
We have to collect some
more information about her. - Yes.

279
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,280
Can you please try it?

280
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,240
I'll try. Anyway

281
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,080
don't make a fake
story about this girl too.

282
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,520
The lives of many people who
are unknown to us

283
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,480
may be unusual than a story.

284
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,120
We are staying in Buraydah.

285
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,880
It's 400 kilometres
from Riyadh.

286
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,040
It'll take maximum three
and a half hours to reach there.

287
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,240
You can enjoy the view until then.

288
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,640
Because once you get
inside the Arab's house

289
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,560
you won't be able to go out at all.

290
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,960
You must be hungry, right?

291
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,560
You have waited for one
and a half day at the airport.

292
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,280
It's okay. - Okay.

293
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,880
On the way..
- What are you blabbering?

294
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,160
Look straight while you
drive, you moron. Go left..

295
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,760
He can't see properly.
He is instructing me to go left.

296
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,320
He's been poking
and irritating me with his stick

297
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,800
since the last ten years.

298
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,120
He tells me the direction
by poking with his stick.

299
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,880
For taking a left, he pokes
me on the left shoulder.

300
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,600
For taking a right, he pokes me
on the right shoulder.

301
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,320
And to go straight,
he hits me on the head.

302
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,360
Now I'm well aware
of all the directions.

303
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,240
But this old man still
pokes me all the time.

304
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,960
Go straight..

305
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,280
I know the direction, Sir.
You don't have to poke me.

306
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,040
What are you telling her?

307
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,560
I was telling her
about your family.

308
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,840
This man's name
is Khalid Ahmad Bin Said Mohammed.

309
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,240
His son is our sponsor.

310
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,520
Nawaf Ahmed Bin Khalid Muhammad.

311
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,680
Then there is his wife, the
sponsor's wife and their children.

312
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,840
They are very well behaved.

313
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,760
You'll know about them
when you reach there.

314
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:23,160
Enough! She'll learn everything.
You don't have to teach her.

315
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:27,040
He's saying that you'll learn
everything on your own.

316
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,400
Drive fast, you moron!

317
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,160
I have a wish, ma'am.

318
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,240
I want to kill this old man

319
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,640
and spend the rest of my
life in the jail in Saudi.

320
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,880
This is the house.

321
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,720
Please come, ma'am.

322
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,560
Come..

323
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,400
This is our sponsor.

324
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,080
Sir, this is the new housemaid.

325
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,640
Passport..

326
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,760
He wants your passport.
- Okay.

327
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,080
You can go inside. Go straight
and then take a left.

328
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,480
Go on.

329
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,320
Don't hesitate.
Just come inside.

330
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,680
I said, come here.

331
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,280
Sameera, this is the
new housemaid.

332
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,040
What's your name?

333
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,600
Name.. What's your name?

334
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,240
Your name?

335
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,400
Aswathi.

336
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,680
Her name is Aswathi.

337
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,880
Fatma..

338
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:00,560
We already have a cook. So you
can do rest of the work.

339
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,520
You'll have to look
after the kids too.

340
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,200
Fatma, she's the new
housemaid from Kerala.

341
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:12,200
Teach her everything properly.
- Okay.

342
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,200
Go and show her room.
And give her a dress to change.

343
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,240
Come. This is your room.

344
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,320
Sari? - Yes.

345
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:52,720
It suits you. I have seen
saris in Hindi movies.

346
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,480
Change your dress.
You can't wear a sari here.

347
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,560
Change your sari.

348
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,960
"A new face."

349
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,920
"A new face this time."

350
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,400
"A new face."

351
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,240
"A new face.."

352
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,160
Wow! You look good.

353
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,400
You look like a Muslim now.

354
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,720
Aswathi is beautiful.
She looks good in everything.

355
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,440
Did you understand
what Fatma said?

356
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,920
I don't understand a word
they speak.

357
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,720
Don't worry, you will learn slowly.

358
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,120
Even I couldn't understand
anything at first. - Aswathi!

359
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,400
The sponsor's wife is calling you.

360
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,200
This is your first day. Be careful.

361
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,360
"A new face."

362
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,160
"A new face."

363
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,160
Aswathi!

364
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,200
Aswathi!

365
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,280
Where were you? Come here!

366
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:30,800
Don't cry.. It's okay..

367
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,200
Come inside!

368
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,800
Keep an eye on Badarin.

369
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,880
He's dirty. Go and clean him up.
Then clean the floor.

370
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,160
Take him indoor. Then clean
the floor. Did you understand?

371
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,960
Apply this medicine.

372
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,600
It will heal by tomorrow.

373
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,520
Is it hurting?
- What?

374
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,960
Is it paining?

375
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,640
It's better now.
- Okay.

376
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,560
Who all are there in your family?

377
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,440
House. Your family?

378
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,160
My house is in Kerala.

379
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,040
No. House?

380
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,600
Oh, are you asking about my family?

381
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,160
Father. Mother.

382
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,520
Sister. Brother.

383
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,120
Are you married?

384
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,560
No, I'm not married.

385
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,320
Where did you learn my language?

386
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,840
Marriage is 'Kalyanam' in your
language and 'Manikka' in mine.

387
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,760
I like your language.
I learnt it from Usman.

388
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,640
Don't worry. I'll teach
you Malayalam. - Really?

389
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,880
I'll take you to my village too.

390
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,560
Have you heard of Kerala?
God's own country.

391
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,840
It's not like this place.
It's a place full of greenery.

392
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,560
Everything is green there.

393
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,440
It's a place full of trees.
Trees..

394
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,680
It rains six months a year there.

395
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,560
Have you ever got drenched
in the rain? Rain.. - Yes.

396
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:57,680
My house is near seashore.
My dad is a fisherman.

397
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,680
Mom, my sister and me
used to stay at home.

398
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,480
Sometimes, dad returned after 2-3
days. I used to wait for him.

399
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,840
The sound of the sea
at night is like music.

400
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,960
Great. You guys are talking
in your languages.

401
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,280
People who listen
to you will go mad.

402
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,880
Do you even understand
what she's saying?

403
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,280
She's from Indonesia.

404
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,600
When Tsunami hit her village

405
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,520
she lost her family
in that incident.

406
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,480
She survived because she was at her
relative's place at that time.

407
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,240
When her relatives
couldn't look after her

408
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,840
they sent her here to work.

409
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,880
They wanted someone
to earn for them.

410
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,920
Here. Keep this phone with you.

411
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,720
Use it only at night.

412
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,560
If they see you using
it during the daytime

413
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,680
they will beat you up.

414
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,560
You can tell your
family to call you.

415
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,560
If you call them,
it'll cost you a fortune.

416
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,800
See you.

417
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,200
Make a call.

418
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,320
Usman..

419
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,400
Where the hell are you?

420
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,760
The old man has started
to cause trouble.

421
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,160
Usman! - Yes.

422
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,360
Polish my shoes.
- Okay.

423
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,400
Just stand somewhere first.

424
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,200
Oh, dear Lord!

425
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,360
He can't see properly.

426
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,680
But he can see women

427
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,520
even if she's standing
a 100 mile away.

428
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,080
Sometimes, he teases them.

429
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,800
Just ignore him or else we
will get into trouble.

430
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,720
First, he used
to torture Fatma.

431
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,360
What is it?

432
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,680
I was telling her to clean
the floors properly.

433
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,960
When you are here,
you must speak in Arabic.

434
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,680
Stop speaking in other languages.
Do you understand?

435
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,960
Aswathi..

436
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,040
She's calling you.
- Usman. - Yes.

437
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,440
Translate what I say to her.

438
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,600
Okay, ma'am.

439
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,680
She said to wash all
the clothes properly. - Okay.

440
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,840
Feed that fat kid
when he wakes up.

441
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,520
You must prepare the
dinner tonight.

442
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,560
They are going to the farmhouse
to have a party and eat.

443
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,120
They will want food
when they return. Sad!

444
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,240
Usman. - Yes.
- Come on. - Okay.

445
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,560
Here, hold this.
I'll go to drop them.

446
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,200
Yes, come.

447
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:07,800
Why did you stop?
Why did you stop singing?

448
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,600
They have gone.

449
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,720
Sing. - No.

450
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,680
You sing.
- No, I can't.

451
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,840
I can't sing.
You sing. - No!

452
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,120
Sing.. Please!
Sing. - No..

453
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:27,800
"Under the tree full of flowers"

454
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,240
"for whom did you wait
on that sunny day?"

455
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:38,720
"The breeze there continues
to sing a melodious song "

456
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:44,760
"even if it stops drizzling."

457
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,080
"Will you come with me"

458
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:55,480
"without letting anyone know"

459
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,840
"like the flowers"

460
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,960
"of the 'Onam' festival?"

461
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:06,800
"Under the tree full of flowers"

462
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,920
"for whom did you wait
on that sunny day?"

463
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,920
"Someone was hiding"

464
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:48,240
"between the rejuvenating
sun rays."

465
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:53,880
"Like a garland
offered to a Goddess"

466
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:59,240
"you came to me as an
aroma of sandalwood."

467
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:04,960
"The oceans faraway"

468
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,760
"flowed silently."

469
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,600
"Silently.."

470
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,480
"Silently.."

471
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:21,160
"Will you"

472
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:26,800
"be there by my side"

473
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:30,200
"in all the good and bad times"

474
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,920
"of my life?"

475
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:37,840
"Under the tree.." - 'If you stop
drinking, smoking and fighting'

476
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,040
'I'll consider the proposal.'

477
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:43,360
"For whom did you wait
on that sunny day?"

478
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,880
'I stopped.'

479
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,520
'I stopped.'

480
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,160
'I stopped.'

481
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:27,720
"The birds looking for food"

482
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:33,400
"in the fields,
will fly away."

483
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:38,920
"Someone in a small house
will weave dreams."

484
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:44,400
"The paths will be filled
with blossomed flowers."

485
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:49,880
"One day"

486
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:54,600
"those flowers will adorn
your hair"

487
00:37:55,120 --> 00:38:00,160
"and make them beautiful."

488
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:06,200
"Will you come with me"

489
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:11,680
"without letting anyone know"

490
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:17,120
"like the flowers
of the 'Onam' festival?"

491
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,960
"Under the tree full of flowers"

492
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:27,920
"for whom did you wait
on that sunny day?"

493
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:33,440
"The breeze there continues
to sing a melodious song "

494
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:39,320
"even if it stops drizzling."

495
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:44,880
"Will you come with me"

496
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:50,440
"without letting anyone know"

497
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:56,280
"like the flowers
of the 'Onam' festival?"

498
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:01,400
"Under the tree full of flowers"

499
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:06,920
"for whom did you wait
on that sunny day?"

500
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,040
Usman is my
friend's brother-in-law.

501
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,960
He's going back
to Saudi tomorrow.

502
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,360
He said that he'd help
to get me a visa.

503
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,040
I might get a small job at first.

504
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,160
Then I'll have to get
a license from there.

505
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,640
Usman said that if I get a job as
a truck driver, I can earn a lot.

506
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,920
Then all our problems
will resolve in 2-3 years.

507
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,200
Why are you quiet?

508
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,680
You have to look after your dad's
treatment and siblings' education.

509
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,520
There's a lot of burden on you.

510
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,240
And on top of that, you
are repaying my dad's debts

511
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,640
and looking after my family.

512
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:50,320
It's okay. We are one family.

513
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,920
Your problems are mine too.

514
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,960
So we'll find a way
to deal with it.

515
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,840
I have become a decent husband.
Isn't that enough for you?

516
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:03,880
Then why can't you
allow me to work?

517
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,200
You know that I can
still find a job.

518
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,280
No, you don't have to work.

519
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,840
I would rather prefer that you
spend the money I earn.

520
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,280
Okay, my darling?

521
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,920
I don't understand why
we have to get married.

522
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,360
You should change this old
mentality, we must be broad-minded.

523
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:25,840
This is nothing serious.
We are just having a fling.

524
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,280
Don't forget that you
are ruining her life, Usman.

525
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,680
You have a wife
and kids in your village.

526
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:36,040
Exactly. They are in the village.
But I want someone here.

527
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,320
Shit!

528
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:42,240
Sometimes, you need to ignore
some things, ma'am.

529
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,600
Ignore the things
that don't concern you.

530
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,080
Here. Your last month's salary.

531
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,600
The sponsor gave it to me.
This is 600 riyal.

532
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,880
Six hundred riyal?
But you said that I'd get..

533
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,200
I know that I said 800 riyal.
But 200 riyal is my commission.

534
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:04,520
Sometimes I pay her some cash
for coming into my room.

535
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,880
Not as payment, but
as a token of love.

536
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,200
I can arrange for that money
only through these means.

537
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,120
I have to look after my family
in the village.

538
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,400
I have to send money to them too.

539
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,080
I'll send this cash
to your family.

540
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,840
Mom, come out. I think
we have a letter.

541
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,120
Is that Aswathi's letter?

542
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,880
No, it's from the
chit fund company.

543
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,040
We must pay them soon.

544
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,920
Oh, God. Why didn't
Aswathi write to us?

545
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,080
Mom, come here.
It's a call from abroad.

546
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:53,120
Hello.
- Is this Aswathi's residence?

547
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,640
Yes, who's this?

548
00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:00,320
I'm calling from Saudi Arabia.
I want some details about Aswathi.

549
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,760
It's from Saudi Arabia.

550
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,360
Hello. Who's this?

551
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,880
Where is my daughter?
Why doesn't she call?

552
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,960
Are you Aswathi's mom?
- Yes.

553
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:14,120
When was the last time
Aswathi phoned you?

554
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,680
Oh, is she okay?

555
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:20,200
It's been more than five months
since I heard from her.

556
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,600
She used to call me

557
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:26,120
and her husband's family
every week.

558
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:29,040
She sent us money
for two months.

559
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,200
Now she neither calls us
nor does she write to us.

560
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,880
We can't even reach her
on her cell phone.

561
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,360
What happened to my daughter?

562
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,720
Who are you?

563
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,600
We don't want any money.

564
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,400
We just want to see her.

565
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:59,280
Hello. Razak, tell me.

566
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:01,480
Oh, did you call them?

567
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,240
What was their reaction?

568
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,000
Is it?

569
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,360
Did you inform them about the
news that was published here?

570
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,040
How can I tell them about
that news of their daughter

571
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,080
from whom they
haven't heard since six months?

572
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,080
Tomorrow I'm going to Buraydah.

573
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,880
I'll go to her sponsor
and find out.

574
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:22,520
Okay, I'll keep reporting you
about the investigation.

575
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,680
I know you want something to write
in that Sunday's column. - Yes.

576
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,880
Can I get some more
news, please?

577
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,320
I didn't get any breaking news.

578
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:36,120
I had told you about Chand Basha.
Write about him.

579
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,280
That's not news.

580
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,880
Even the journalists
aren't interested in Chand Basha.

581
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,800
I took that man to the hospital.
What else can I do now?

582
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:48,680
We can't keep him in the camp.
When I called his native

583
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:51,840
his wife told me not to send
him back there. - Why?

584
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,960
Look, he's a glutton.

585
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:57,880
He eats food meant for four
people. We are fed up of him.

586
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,680
The food here isn't delicious.

587
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:03,360
It's like eating bland food.

588
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:07,920
So you guys ran
away by ignoring me.

589
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,000
It's been three days since I
asked for a Chicken Biryani.

590
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,320
But nobody cares.

591
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,320
Let me make it very clear.

592
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,640
I can't stay here

593
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,360
if I don't get some
good delicacies.

594
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,720
Give them some cash for me.

595
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:27,880
Take the money
for my cigarettes too. Okay?

596
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,400
Are you leaving?

597
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,480
Wait till your plaster is removed.

598
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,800
We'll make the arrangements
for your deportation by then.

599
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,200
Forget about sending me home

600
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,880
arrange for my Biryani instead.

601
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,080
Okay.

602
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,960
There's an inspection
in the camp this Friday.

603
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,880
I'll lose my job if they find
a man who doesn't work here.

604
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,200
What can I do for that?

605
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,040
Razak, you'll have to find
a solution.

606
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:57,280
Did I ask you to appoint a man
without a work permit?

607
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,720
That was a mistake.

608
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,640
If you don't do anything,
we'll throw him away somewhere.

609
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:05,360
This is not Razak's business.
Let's go.

610
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,320
Razak, please..

611
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,840
Just keep him with you
for two more days.

612
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,040
I'll find a solution by then.

613
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:18,800
Go away from here!
I don't want to listen to you.

614
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,560
That housemaid ruined our
family's reputation. Just go..

615
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,560
Sir, if there has been a mistake
from us, Indians

616
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:30,240
we'll investigate. I'm coming
from the embassy.

617
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,520
I don't want to hear anything.

618
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:35,160
You Malayalees aren't trustworthy.
Aren't you a Malayalee too?

619
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:40,560
If you don't leave this
instant, I'll get you arrested.

620
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:41,960
Get lost!

621
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,040
What happened?
Did you get to know anything?

622
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,680
Today I came to know that there
are swear words in Arabic too.

623
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,360
It was his loss,
that's why he's furious.

624
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,960
After seeing his reaction

625
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,160
I feel there's something fishy.

626
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,880
If we investigate

627
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,360
I'm sure we'll get some clue.

628
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,800
What would be the outcome of it?
Ajith Menon will get a news item

629
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,800
and you'll lose some riyal.

630
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:25,040
I'm not investigating this matter
only to help him get a news.

631
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,600
What if that woman is innocent?

632
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:31,440
If so, she might have gone missing
because of some reason.

633
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,120
I'm a reputed officer.

634
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,120
If the people outside come
to know.. - Don't hit me, sir.

635
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,200
...that the servants in my house
are engaged in adultery

636
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:42,520
my reputation will be spoiled.

637
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,760
So I'm not complaining
to the police.

638
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,960
But I have the right to punish
you. - Please don't beat me.

639
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:49,200
In spite of being a Muslim,
you committed this sin.

640
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,640
Even the God won't forgive you.
He'll bless us for beating you.

641
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:54,400
I'll kill you if you try
to ruin our family's reputation.

642
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,560
Don't beat me, sir.

643
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,040
Where's that disgusting guy?

644
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:12,280
I left you alive only because you
have been with us for ten years.

645
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,760
If you stay here any longer

646
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,640
I'll get you arrested.
So, go away!

647
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:32,120
Don't give her even
a drop of water.

648
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:08,880
Fatma.

649
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,080
They are all asleep.

650
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,360
Food.

651
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,440
You'll get sick if you
don't eat anything.

652
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:21,360
Go. If they see this,
they will beat you up.

653
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:23,560
I had warned you about this.

654
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,120
But you both didn't listen to me.

655
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:35,000
Hello. It's Usman. Hello.

656
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,720
Ma'am, I made a mistake.

657
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,840
I got punished for it too.

658
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,400
I'm really worried
for that poor girl.

659
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,320
Those people will kill her.

660
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:47,920
If she gets out of there

661
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,680
I'll arrange a job
for her somewhere else.

662
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,320
I want you to help
her to get out of there.

663
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,160
What? What if they find out?

664
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,840
No one will come to know
if she gets out now.

665
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:02,360
I'm in the backyard right now.

666
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,880
Please, ma'am. Help her.

667
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:10,920
There's an exit in your room
which is covered with cardboard.

668
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:14,440
You can reach the backyard
if you come through that.

669
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,600
I'm waiting there.

670
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:20,440
Please let me talk to Fatma.
I'll explain to her.

671
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,840
Take it. - Hello. Usman.

672
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,240
How did she escape?

673
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,920
Tell us. She won't leave
without your knowledge.

674
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,840
Just tell us the truth.

675
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,720
I don't know..

676
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:42,560
Why did Usman call you
last night? Tell me!

677
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,600
You can't keep this phone anymore.

678
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:31,280
Over here..

679
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,280
Look carefully..

680
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,120
Look over there..

681
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,960
Yes, there..

682
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,600
Look carefully..

683
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:46,360
Who drowned?
- It's Radhakrishnan.

684
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:53,000
He jumped into the lake
to save the kids who were drowning.

685
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,360
He drowned while saving them.

686
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:57,920
He is nowhere to be seen.
- Look over there..

687
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,520
It's a deep lake.

688
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,440
Don't go there..

689
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:08,960
Don't go there..

690
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,760
Get up!

691
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:24,720
Here. Eat!

692
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,360
We shouldn't give you to eat.

693
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:44,720
What's this? Haven't you
learnt to iron yet?

694
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,920
Let me see how you iron them.

695
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:54,720
Let me teach you how to iron.

696
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:00,080
Working as a housemaid
in Saudi Arabia is a very easy job.

697
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:03,200
Those people have machines
for everything.

698
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:06,600
We just have to stand there
and operate those machines.

699
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,400
Usman told me about this job.

700
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:13,000
The job is in the house
where Usman works as a driver.

701
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:16,640
He said that they'd pay
her 800 riyal.

702
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,800
It would be around Rs. 10,000.

703
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,400
If we agree, he will send
the visa as soon as possible.

704
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:26,840
No, Sudheer. I can't send
her to work as a housemaid

705
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:28,920
in an unknown place.

706
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,240
My son won't forgive me for that.

707
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:37,120
It's okay, Father-in-law.
I will go.

708
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,080
Our prestige won't help us

709
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,880
to solve our financial problems.

710
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:47,560
It's better than staying at home
and crying over our loss.

711
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,760
Medicine. Here, apply it.

712
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,920
Sleep..

713
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:50,600
Good night..

714
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:16,240
We don't want to send you.

715
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:59,600
Hey, get up. Clean the house.

716
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,400
We are going out.

717
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:33,560
Hello.

718
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,160
Usman.

719
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:39,320
What happened, Aswathi?

720
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,320
I can't take it anymore.

721
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:50,280
If I stay here, I will die.

722
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:54,400
They are torturing me a lot.

723
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,960
It's been five months now.

724
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,480
I haven't sent money to my home.

725
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:06,600
I can't even make a call
to my family through this phone.

726
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:10,640
I have to go back somehow.

727
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,720
What can I do?

728
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:15,960
Please send me home.

729
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,120
Is somebody there now?

730
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:20,880
No, they went to the farmhouse.

731
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,960
Then they'll return at night.
Do one thing.

732
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:26,840
Escape from there just like Fatma.

733
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,720
Escape from there
after the azan.

734
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:39,160
After getting out, walk
towards the right.

735
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:43,120
You'll find a shop named Al Wahda.
A friend, Mr. Abu, runs that shop.

736
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:47,320
I'll inform him.
He'll drop you at my place.

737
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,520
I'm at Riyadh right now.

738
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:55,840
Be careful. You'll have to pass
through the gate.

739
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,360
That watchman
would be standing there.

740
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:00,120
He shouldn't see you.

741
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:03,320
I think this is your chance
to escape from there.

742
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:05,920
Usman.

743
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:07,000
Don't think so much.

744
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:08,960
I'll take care of everything
once you reach Riyadh.

745
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,640
Where did the housemaid go?
- I don't know, sir.

746
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:52,720
Get the car!

747
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:27,120
Mr. Abu..

748
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:30,160
Mr. Abu..

749
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:37,400
Mr. Abu..

750
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:24,120
Did you start smoking too?
- What can I say, John!

751
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:26,560
I have to face the problems
that come to me.

752
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:32,320
Take this.

753
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:34,000
Did you buy only one packet?

754
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:52,080
This is Chand Basha.

755
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:55,520
He'll be here until his
plaster is removed.

756
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:57,360
Please come, Chand Basha.
- Oh, my Lord!

757
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:05,280
Oh, Lord!

758
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:07,040
In order to get deported
to his village

759
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:08,880
he'll have to surrender
to the police and go to jail.

760
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:10,800
How can I send him there
with this broken leg?

761
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:12,960
I'm really hungry.

762
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:16,280
On the way, you
had 'Parotta' and mutton chops.

763
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:19,160
I don't know why,
but when I smoke

764
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:21,320
the food I ate gets
digested fast.

765
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:25,200
Don't you have an ashtray here?

766
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:31,360
He's a good man.

767
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:34,160
The only problem is that even
his wife doesn't want him.

768
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:36,080
He's from Kasaragod.

769
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:39,080
He and his three kids survive

770
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:40,920
on the food that his wife gets
by working as a maid.

771
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,040
If he goes there, he'll eat
up all the food.

772
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:45,800
That's why his wife said
not to send him back.

773
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:47,840
Wow, what a good man!

774
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:51,320
Razak, please keep your
social work outside.

775
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:52,800
Don't bring it to home.

776
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:55,160
We don't have a big house.

777
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:56,760
We can't live here freely

778
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,920
if a stranger comes and stays here.

779
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:02,640
Moreover, it is illegal to let
a man with no documents stay here.

780
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:04,600
Serena, please adjust
for some time.

781
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:07,400
I took his responsibility.
I can't leave him on the street.

782
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:10,160
Make some more rice before the
kids return from school.

783
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:11,960
Or else there won't
be any food for them.

784
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:18,360
Hello. Tell me, Varghese.
Right, that Usman.

785
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:21,760
You found him! Where?
I'll be there soon.

786
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:24,080
Where is the ashtray?

787
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:27,600
Let it lie on the floor.

788
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:29,920
Serena, I'll be late.
Do one thing.

789
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:32,240
Make an omelette for him.

790
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:34,080
He's our guest.

791
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:36,920
Tell her
that I would like it spicy.

792
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:42,160
Make some tea
and put it in a flask.

793
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:44,960
I have the habit of drinking
tea at regular intervals.

794
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:01,840
You are Usman, right? - Yes.

795
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:04,640
I've been looking
for you since some days.

796
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:06,080
It was really difficult
to find you.

797
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:08,400
Who are you?
What's the matter?

798
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:11,680
You used to work as a driver in an
Arab's house in Buraydah, right?

799
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:15,280
That was a long time ago.
I don't do that anymore. - Okay.

800
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:18,120
But you know where
Aswathi is, don't you?

801
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:20,560
Who is Aswathi?
I don't know.

802
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:23,800
You gave Aswathi a job as
a housemaid in that Arab's house.

803
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:28,040
Oh, that girl. I shouldn't
have got her that job.

804
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:31,480
I helped her so that she
could solve her financial problems.

805
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:34,080
But look what she did

806
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:36,200
after she started earning.

807
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:39,480
So you read everything
in the news. - Yes.

808
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:41,640
I went to meet
Aswathi's sponsor.

809
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:43,280
He abused you as well.

810
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:44,720
Why did you leave that place?

811
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,160
That's none of your business.

812
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:49,760
Are you saying that you

813
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:51,760
have nothing to do with that theft?

814
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:53,440
Oh, I see. Are you trying

815
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:55,160
to blame me for that?

816
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:58,960
I already have enough problems.

817
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:00,960
Please tell us what
you know about her.

818
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:03,800
We just want to save
that poor girl.

819
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,440
That's the reason
I gave her a job here.

820
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:09,720
I am not ready to invite trouble
by helping her again.

821
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:12,400
Usman.

822
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:15,880
I didn't ask her
to steal or to escape.

823
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:18,280
Why are you so concerned about her?

824
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:21,240
Why does it matter now?

825
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:31,160
Varghese, do you think he
was telling the truth?

826
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:34,640
No. It's obvious from his looks
that he is a fraud.

827
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:37,600
He knows where that girl is.

828
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:26,440
Water..

829
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:28,720
Water.

830
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:30,160
Give her water.

831
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:53,560
Are you going towards Riyadh?

832
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:55,440
What? Riyadh?

833
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:56,840
Riyadh?

834
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:58,280
Do you want a lift to Riyadh?

835
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:00,960
Yes. Riyadh.

836
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:02,960
Riyadh.

837
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:13,040
Do you want to go to Riyadh?

838
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:16,400
Yes, Riyadh.
- Come with me.

839
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:24,960
Get in.

840
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:26,760
Come on. Get in.

841
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:31,560
Oh, God! Stop the truck!

842
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:34,040
Stop the truck!

843
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:36,960
Where are you taking me? Stop!

844
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:38,960
Stop the truck!

845
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:40,920
Stop the truck!

846
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:43,560
Where are we going?

847
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:45,800
Stop the truck!

848
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:47,800
I want to go to Riyadh.

849
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:51,240
Stop!

850
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:56,560
Stop the truck!

851
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:03,160
Stop the truck!

852
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:07,360
Stop the truck!

853
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:13,880
Stop!

854
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:45,200
Get down..

855
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:47,080
This is Riyadh for us today.

856
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:51,520
Don't be scared.

857
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:53,320
Get down.

858
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:55,240
Get down.

859
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:01,840
Get down, beautiful.

860
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:15,240
Come, beautiful. Come..

861
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:22,600
Come.

862
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:26,360
Sit here.

863
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:32,160
Hurry up. Open it.

864
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:40,120
Don't worry. Go and sit there.

865
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:03,880
Eat.

866
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:07,840
Why is she so scared?
Did you do anything?

867
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:10,160
No, I didn't do anything.

868
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:22,960
Eat..

869
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,880
Look at her. She fears
that we'll eat her.

870
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:29,680
We didn't even do anything to her
and she's already scared.

871
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:31,800
What would happen when
we do something to her?

872
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:00,160
Oh, God!

873
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:04,880
Hey..

874
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:24,600
Go.. Escape from here.

875
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:27,320
Or else they'll.. Go!

876
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:29,120
Run away before they find you.

877
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:32,000
Run away from here.

878
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:34,920
Don't stay here. Go!

879
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:37,840
Run and save yourself. Go!

880
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:39,520
Go!

881
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:41,280
Don't stop anywhere!

882
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:18,520
Where did you take her
while we were praying?

883
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:20,640
Speak up, you dog!

884
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:22,560
Where is she?

885
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:26,560
Where did you hide her?

886
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:28,120
Speak out..

887
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:31,320
Where is she? Where did you
hide her? Speak out!

888
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:32,800
Speak up, you dog!

889
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:41,400
Tie him up. He should not escape.

890
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:44,960
Dirty animal. Let him lie there.

891
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:53,680
We will find her from wherever
she is in this dessert.

892
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:09,760
Basheer.

893
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:12,960
Basheer.

894
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:24,960
Basheer.

895
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:26,920
Where is he?

896
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:02,040
Basheer. What happened to you?

897
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:05,320
It looks like they
beat you up a lot.

898
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:07,760
Did you try to escape again?

899
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:12,360
Don't you know that the desert
here is like a sea?

900
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:16,440
It's not easy to escape from here.

901
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:21,800
Even I did this job
for around six years.

902
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,040
Although I am stronger than you,
I couldn't escape from here.

903
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:27,960
Get up. Go and feed the goats.
They're hungry.

904
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:31,400
I didn't try to escape.
- Then what?

905
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:33,560
Bharathan, please come with me.

906
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:35,560
They must have killed that girl.

907
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:38,200
Which girl?
- I'll tell you. Just come with me.

908
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:40,840
Get the truck. Let's go and see.

909
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:42,240
What? - Just come.

910
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:27,480
Where will we look
for her in this dessert?

911
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:29,440
They must have found that girl.

912
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:34,680
You don't even know that girl.
Forget about her, Basheer.

913
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:44,520
That's enough. Let's go back.

914
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:45,960
Let's drive some more.

915
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:49,560
Oh, God! I have to return
before noon.

916
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:52,320
Let her go. Who is she to you?

917
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,480
I said, just drive!

918
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:22,600
Stop..
Bharathan, stop the truck!

919
01:29:58,760 --> 01:29:59,840
Hey.

920
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,840
Hey..

921
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:11,360
Bharathan..

922
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:15,640
Hey.

923
01:30:57,080 --> 01:30:58,400
Hey.

924
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:05,760
Don't worry, it's me.

925
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:09,040
It was me who saved
you yesterday.

926
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:15,800
He is my friend.

927
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:24,680
I was praying to God to protect
you from those guys.

928
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:26,440
God saved her.

929
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:31,920
They can be here any minute.

930
01:31:32,160 --> 01:31:34,160
You must escape
from here before that.

931
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,640
Bharathan, will you help her?

932
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:41,520
Can you drop her on the road?

933
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:47,120
Please do it.

934
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:50,120
Does she wants to go
to Riyadh?

935
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:01,840
You!
- No!

936
01:33:32,280 --> 01:33:34,960
Razak, do you remember me?

937
01:33:36,040 --> 01:33:37,520
Yes.

938
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:40,560
I came to know about you later.

939
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:44,400
Can you come out for a minute?

940
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:55,960
I lied to you that day.

941
01:33:56,240 --> 01:33:57,480
I thought so.

942
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:01,880
Aswathi came to see me that day.

943
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:03,440
'Indian maid escapes
with gold and money.'

944
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:05,400
Did you see the news?

945
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:08,120
I have been extremely worried
from the time I read this.

946
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:11,920
If that man blames me
for this, I'll be in trouble too.

947
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:13,600
Don't you know this woman?

948
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:15,320
Do you think she's capable
of doing this?

949
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:17,720
No matter what I think, she
has been accused of stealing.

950
01:34:17,960 --> 01:34:19,320
We can't mess
with these people.

951
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:22,160
What did I tell you?

952
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:24,160
I told you to come
to Mr. Abu's shop.

953
01:34:24,360 --> 01:34:25,800
And what did she do?

954
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:28,720
Mr. Abu waited for her
till 10 p.m.

955
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:30,640
But she didn't go there.

956
01:34:30,920 --> 01:34:32,520
It's been two days.

957
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:35,640
God knows where she had been
for these two days.

958
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:37,280
Are you done talking?

959
01:34:37,720 --> 01:34:40,960
I was told to drop her here.
Now do what you want.

960
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:43,640
I've been in Saudi Arabia
since ten years.

961
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:45,880
So drop this attitude.

962
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,960
Don't be too smart with me.

963
01:34:48,160 --> 01:34:51,000
When you are done with her, you
want me to take her responsibility?

964
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:54,440
If you are bored with her,
hand over her to someone else.

965
01:34:55,880 --> 01:34:58,760
What did you say?
- Leave me.

966
01:35:01,480 --> 01:35:04,720
I didn't know what
else to do at that time.

967
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:06,880
I was thinking only about me.

968
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:10,120
Sometimes, we all get selfish.

969
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:13,560
I had asked her to escape
from there to help her.

970
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:15,640
I got the Indonesian girl
who escaped with me

971
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:17,880
the job of a housemaid.

972
01:35:18,240 --> 01:35:20,960
I wanted to help Aswathi too.

973
01:35:21,160 --> 01:35:23,960
Why did you change your mind now?
Are you feeling guilty?

974
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:26,680
After meeting you

975
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:28,960
I couldn't get Aswathi
out of my mind.

976
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:32,280
She's nobody to you.
Still, you want to help her.

977
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:34,400
So how can I be so irresponsible?

978
01:35:35,080 --> 01:35:36,760
I was helpless, Razak.

979
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:39,440
I have been working
here as a driver

980
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:41,320
with a lot of difficulties.

981
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:50,040
I'm glad that someone like
you is here in Saudi Arabia.

982
01:35:50,720 --> 01:35:53,400
I want you to find her.

983
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:55,800
Who's that truck driver who
brought Aswathi to you?

984
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:57,880
I didn't ask that.

985
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:12,600
Is he the fool
who promised to help you?

986
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:32,480
Do you know someone
else who can help you?

987
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:38,000
This is just my bad luck.

988
01:37:03,640 --> 01:37:06,120
Get down.
You'll get a ride from here.

989
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:09,160
Go anywhere you want.

990
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:11,160
I can't help you anymore.

991
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:15,600
Don't waste my time. Get down!

992
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:22,400
Get in.

993
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:27,080
I said, get in.

994
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:35,360
You can leave.

995
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:38,880
Then what? Basheer
risked his life

996
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:40,840
so that he can protect you.

997
01:38:41,120 --> 01:38:44,120
What will I tell him?
That I abandoned you.

998
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:50,920
Now just get in.

999
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:16,920
"It's a lonely journey."

1000
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:23,000
"A journey that never ends."

1001
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:28,520
"It's a lonely journey."

1002
01:39:28,760 --> 01:39:32,120
"A journey that never ends."

1003
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:40,960
"With an unquenchable agony"

1004
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:45,200
"this is a journey
with no destination."

1005
01:39:46,840 --> 01:39:51,240
"This is a journey
with no destination."

1006
01:39:56,680 --> 01:40:01,880
"Whether it is the night
or the day.."

1007
01:40:02,440 --> 01:40:07,080
"Whether it is sunlight
or shadow.."

1008
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:14,000
"Will this journey ever end?"

1009
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:19,200
"Or will the distance
increase again?"

1010
01:40:19,880 --> 01:40:24,640
"Will the distance increase again?"

1011
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:29,840
"Will the distance increase again?"

1012
01:40:30,840 --> 01:40:35,160
"Will the distance increase again?"

1013
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:41,680
Hide under the seat. Hide
from the police.

1014
01:40:42,520 --> 01:40:44,240
What if they question us?

1015
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:48,800
If they see us, we'll be in jail.
Don't you know the law?

1016
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:51,920
You can relax now.

1017
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:19,640
"The stars disappear from the sky,
the shore is distancing itself."

1018
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:25,160
"I can see the infinite distance."

1019
01:41:25,560 --> 01:41:30,480
"The sky is filled
with dark clouds."

1020
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:42,200
Close the door.

1021
01:41:42,280 --> 01:41:47,240
"The ways are unknown,
the paths ahead are breaking away."

1022
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:53,040
"All the doors of hope
are closing down."

1023
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:58,400
"Will the moonlight"

1024
01:41:58,600 --> 01:42:03,600
"light up this dark night?"

1025
01:42:04,160 --> 01:42:08,560
"Will it light up this dark night?"

1026
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:18,800
"It's a lonely journey."

1027
01:42:19,160 --> 01:42:24,480
"A journey that never ends."

1028
01:42:24,720 --> 01:42:29,560
"It's a lonely journey."

1029
01:42:30,200 --> 01:42:31,920
"A journey that never ends."

1030
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:33,280
Your dress is dirty.

1031
01:42:34,280 --> 01:42:35,720
Here, change your dress.

1032
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:42,200
"With an unquenchable agony"

1033
01:42:42,840 --> 01:42:47,880
"this is a journey with no
destination." - Here, eat this.

1034
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:53,160
"This is a journey
with no destination."

1035
01:42:58,160 --> 01:43:03,240
"Whether it is the night
or the day.."

1036
01:43:03,880 --> 01:43:08,800
"Whether it is sunlight
or shadow.."

1037
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:15,320
"Will this journey ever end?"

1038
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:21,040
"Will the distance increase again?"

1039
01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:26,000
"Will the distance increase again?"

1040
01:43:26,920 --> 01:43:30,760
"Will the distance increase again?"

1041
01:43:31,040 --> 01:43:36,080
"It's a lonely journey."

1042
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:39,280
"A journey that never ends."

1043
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:48,000
"With an unquenchable agony"

1044
01:43:49,080 --> 01:43:54,240
"this is a journey
with no destination."

1045
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:59,320
"This is a journey
with no destination."

1046
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:05,440
"This is a journey
with no destination."

1047
01:44:05,680 --> 01:44:08,240
"This is a journey"

1048
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:12,520
"with no destination."

1049
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:15,760
Bharathan, you know the law here.

1050
01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:18,120
If you get caught
with an unknown woman..

1051
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:20,800
I know. But there
must be some way.

1052
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:24,320
Munir, go and give this at home.

1053
01:44:35,720 --> 01:44:37,560
I didn't see that girl.

1054
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:39,800
But Munir said
that she's an innocent girl.

1055
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:44,320
Even Bharathan is a good guy.
He only looks arrogant.

1056
01:44:44,640 --> 01:44:48,240
You know the law here.
Someone found out about her.

1057
01:44:48,720 --> 01:44:50,360
They took away both of them.

1058
01:45:12,160 --> 01:45:13,520
'Adultery! A Malayalee woman
and a man sentenced'

1059
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:15,280
'to three months of imprisonment
and 300 lashes.'

1060
01:45:16,520 --> 01:45:19,760
Okay. It's a case of adultery.

1061
01:45:20,120 --> 01:45:22,680
But this news isn't enough for us.

1062
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:24,960
We need an exclusive news.

1063
01:45:26,200 --> 01:45:29,160
Razak, you were investigating
on this matter, right?

1064
01:45:29,400 --> 01:45:31,840
Let's workout
this story from that angle.

1065
01:45:32,040 --> 01:45:34,760
You should go to the police
station and talk to that woman.

1066
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:37,920
Also talk to that man, Usman
and that sponsor.

1067
01:45:38,120 --> 01:45:41,480
And create a live sketch.

1068
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:44,320
We must put together
the problems in her village

1069
01:45:44,560 --> 01:45:46,160
the torture she had
to go through in that Arab's house

1070
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:49,520
and her miserable journey
in the desert.

1071
01:45:49,800 --> 01:45:52,920
And publish a superb story

1072
01:45:53,160 --> 01:45:55,760
in the paper on all the Fridays
when she gets lashed.

1073
01:45:56,160 --> 01:45:58,440
When the article
has your name in it

1074
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:00,920
most of the Malayalees
here will believe it too.

1075
01:46:01,320 --> 01:46:04,240
News about an amazing
and life threatening

1076
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:06,440
journey of a Malayalee woman.

1077
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:12,240
Razak. - Sitting in this AC room
won't help you understand

1078
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:14,880
the pain people go
through in their lives.

1079
01:46:15,040 --> 01:46:18,080
I meet people like them every day.

1080
01:46:18,160 --> 01:46:19,920
Therefore, their pain hurts me too.

1081
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:21,880
Try to be a human first.

1082
01:47:19,280 --> 01:47:23,440
I'm Razak. A social
worker of Riyadh.

1083
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:29,120
I know how you
escaped from that Arab family

1084
01:47:29,480 --> 01:47:31,120
and how you reached here.

1085
01:47:34,360 --> 01:47:37,000
The law is very strict here.

1086
01:47:37,400 --> 01:47:38,920
We have to bear the punishment.

1087
01:47:41,560 --> 01:47:42,960
You won't be punished
for the complaint

1088
01:47:43,280 --> 01:47:44,760
made against you by the sponsor.

1089
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:47,080
The truth will get
revealed in the court.

1090
01:47:51,120 --> 01:47:54,080
I talked to your parents.

1091
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,480
Don't worry. I didn't tell
them that you are here.

1092
01:47:58,760 --> 01:48:02,360
I lied to them about why
you couldn't contact them.

1093
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:04,600
I don't know whether
they believed me or not.

1094
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:09,920
After your punishment is over,
you can go back to your native.

1095
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:15,160
Be strong. Everything will be fine.

1096
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:25,720
I don't know you. Then
why are you helping me?

1097
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:28,040
You didn't know Aswathi either.

1098
01:48:28,120 --> 01:48:30,520
But still, you helped her.

1099
01:48:33,080 --> 01:48:37,080
Maybe God has planned this
to introduce us to each other.

1100
01:48:39,400 --> 01:48:41,440
Do you want me to inform

1101
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:43,200
anyone in your village?

1102
01:48:43,720 --> 01:48:46,640
No. I don't have anyone

1103
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:48,920
to wait for me.

1104
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:50,840
I don't need your help.

1105
01:48:50,920 --> 01:48:53,400
Your sponsor cancelled your visa.

1106
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:55,480
Now deportation
is the only solution.

1107
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:58,600
If we don't do anything,
the process will get delayed.

1108
01:48:59,160 --> 01:49:01,880
Do you want to suffer
in the jail for that long?

1109
01:49:04,480 --> 01:49:08,200
Even if you don't have a family,
you're going back to your nation.

1110
01:49:08,720 --> 01:49:12,440
I came here 15 years ago,
to escape from the miseries there.

1111
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:14,440
But I couldn't escape.

1112
01:49:14,840 --> 01:49:18,040
I helped that girl because I
didn't want to leave her alone.

1113
01:49:18,360 --> 01:49:20,680
But even she couldn't escape.

1114
01:49:21,160 --> 01:49:23,480
You used to work in
the desert, right?

1115
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:27,280
Even on the deserts
where no life can grow

1116
01:49:27,800 --> 01:49:30,560
we can find a few spots
where life flourishes.

1117
01:49:30,840 --> 01:49:32,720
Those little plants defeat

1118
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:35,440
the heat of the desert.

1119
01:49:36,160 --> 01:49:38,560
If those little plants can do that

1120
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:41,640
even we, the humans,
can face anything.

1121
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:11,040
What did you do, Razak?
- What happened?

1122
01:50:11,240 --> 01:50:13,280
You visit the embassy daily.

1123
01:50:13,560 --> 01:50:16,880
How many times did I tell
you to renew the passport?

1124
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,800
But you always delay.

1125
01:50:20,120 --> 01:50:23,160
You are always concerned
about others.

1126
01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:24,880
Today is Thursday
and tomorrow is Friday.

1127
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:26,040
It's a holiday on both the days.

1128
01:50:26,280 --> 01:50:28,880
But why do I need to renew
my passport now?

1129
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:32,040
I got a call from your home
just now. You were inside.

1130
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:33,840
What's the matter?

1131
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:38,760
Your mom's gone.

1132
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:51,560
She had a heart attack and died.

1133
01:50:53,960 --> 01:50:55,840
How will you reach
your village now?

1134
01:51:08,040 --> 01:51:09,320
Razak.

1135
01:51:17,080 --> 01:51:20,840
Salim, you must carry
out the rituals for me.

1136
01:51:21,880 --> 01:51:23,640
Ask the authorities of the mosque

1137
01:51:23,960 --> 01:51:25,880
to arrange a grave for her

1138
01:51:26,120 --> 01:51:27,920
next to dad's grave.

1139
01:51:28,680 --> 01:51:31,200
That was mom's wish.

1140
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:34,760
Let's leave now.

1141
01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:42,080
We'll keep a funeral here.

1142
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:47,080
I can do only that much for mom.

1143
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:39,360
This is your ticket and out-pass.

1144
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:49,000
We have a lot of nightmares
in our sleep.

1145
01:52:49,480 --> 01:52:52,200
We don't remember it
when we wake up.

1146
01:52:54,280 --> 01:52:56,200
Consider your life here

1147
01:52:56,440 --> 01:52:59,320
like a nightmare
and forget about it.

1148
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:03,360
You must forget
about your sufferings here

1149
01:53:03,720 --> 01:53:05,400
before you get into the flight.

1150
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:52,240
This journey doesn't put
an end to everything.

1151
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:54,280
Right, Bharathan?

1152
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:09,600
Okay.

1153
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,360
Hello? Yes.

1154
01:54:34,200 --> 01:54:36,880
Is it? Which hospital?

1155
01:54:37,880 --> 01:54:39,280
I'll be there soon.

1156
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:52,760
We found this body in the desert.
It's been here for four months.

1157
01:54:59,280 --> 01:55:02,160
No, I don't know.

1158
01:55:02,600 --> 01:55:05,320
I don't recognise this face.
