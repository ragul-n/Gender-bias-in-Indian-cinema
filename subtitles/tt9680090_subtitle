1
00:03:42,174 --> 00:03:45,132
Are you losing sleep
because you are tensed"

2
00:03:45,882 --> 00:03:49,174
Apparently, you gave an ultimatum that you
would wipe me off the market in 24 hours"

3
00:03:49,716 --> 00:03:51,841
There is only twelve hours left now.

4
00:03:52,757 --> 00:03:57,299
If you still think you are courageous
enough to kill me, give it a go.

5
00:04:42,466 --> 00:04:47,174
Knowingly or unknowingly, the woman
who gave me birth gave me this name.

6
00:04:47,424 --> 00:04:49,799
Mani... Mani Shankar.

7
00:04:50,341 --> 00:04:55,341
I am someone who takes all sorts of risks
in this shady part of town for money.

8
00:04:55,841 --> 00:05:01,674
I am like an aggressive bull who
doesn't rest until my opponent is defeated.

9
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,424
Hey, why are you out here"

10
00:05:51,216 --> 00:05:52,424
If not, looks our Mani is going to lose.

11
00:05:52,424 --> 00:05:55,091
Get back in water.

12
00:05:55,091 --> 00:05:55,924
Alright.

13
00:06:00,382 --> 00:06:04,674
Mani... Mani... Mani...Mani... Mani...

14
00:06:04,674 --> 00:06:05,841
Mani... Mani... Mani...
-We are going to win money.

15
00:06:05,841 --> 00:06:07,924
Kaaki" What's the situation like"

16
00:06:07,924 --> 00:06:09,299
Most of them have given up
as they were suffocating.

17
00:06:09,299 --> 00:06:11,132
Mani seems to be holding on.
That is all.

18
00:06:11,424 --> 00:06:13,002
Mani seems to risk
it all for money.

19
00:06:13,027 --> 00:06:15,031
If possible,
he would even do away with oxygen.

20
00:06:28,841 --> 00:06:30,341
Who are those people"

21
00:06:35,882 --> 00:06:38,174
Hey! This is cheating.
Why did they jump"

22
00:06:38,174 --> 00:06:43,216
Giri" Looks like he is new.
The strongest have all the power here.

23
00:07:31,216 --> 00:07:32,091
Look! He is escaping.

24
00:07:34,882 --> 00:07:36,674
Mani... Mani...
Be careful.

25
00:08:13,716 --> 00:08:15,382
Buddy, looks like your brain didn't
grow as much as your beard.

26
00:08:15,716 --> 00:08:17,257
If you play the game, try to abide by the
rules Stop messing with your opponents.

27
00:08:17,299 --> 00:08:19,466
Do you want me to let it go,
when the opposite person cheats"

28
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:20,716
Yes. You should let it go.
What else can you do"

29
00:08:20,716 --> 00:08:22,341
We are not in Olympics
Neither is this legal.

30
00:08:22,341 --> 00:08:25,216
I don't care about all that.
If I play, I play to win. That's all.

31
00:08:25,216 --> 00:08:27,757
Buddy, listen to me. Let's get out
of this illegal gambling business.

32
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:30,507
Luck's not favouring us.
I agree that you were very good at it once.

33
00:08:30,674 --> 00:08:34,132
You still owe 30 lakhs to Joseph.
Do you remember" Do you"

34
00:08:34,382 --> 00:08:35,049
Cheers!

35
00:08:35,674 --> 00:08:36,882
I am talking about 30 lacs..
Why don't you care me"

36
00:08:37,257 --> 00:08:37,757
Come.

37
00:08:38,966 --> 00:08:40,216
He is there

38
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,382
Hope he hasn't died yet.
Thank god!

39
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:46,162
If this is to be taken care of by the
doctor without the involvement of police

40
00:08:46,187 --> 00:08:47,174
it will cost you
twenty-five thousand rupees.

41
00:08:47,174 --> 00:08:48,841
Does it include your commission"
-Shut it!

42
00:08:48,841 --> 00:08:51,049
You should try to negotiate and compromise
Not rob us with commissions.

43
00:08:51,049 --> 00:08:53,799
Won't you shut up ever"
-No, I won't.

44
00:08:54,007 --> 00:08:57,299
This is a medico-legal case.
I managed to persuade the doctor.

45
00:08:57,549 --> 00:09:00,091
Even if we have no clothes on our body
or even money in our wallets,

46
00:09:00,091 --> 00:09:01,424
we have no choice but to pay him.

47
00:09:01,549 --> 00:09:04,841
If not, within an hour,
we will be on the police radar.

48
00:09:04,841 --> 00:09:06,261
If this leaks to the
police, forget our clothes,

49
00:09:06,286 --> 00:09:07,507
they would even strip
us of undergarments.

50
00:09:07,507 --> 00:09:08,174
Thank god! I am not wearing.

51
00:09:08,174 --> 00:09:09,799
Let's figure out something and
try to work it out.

52
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:10,507
Alright.

53
00:09:10,966 --> 00:09:13,882
What's on your mind" Don't you
have a mother whom you left behind"

54
00:09:25,382 --> 00:09:28,049
Why are you lost in thoughts" It's raining.
Why haven't you brought the clothes in"

55
00:09:28,174 --> 00:09:29,466
Your uncle is here. Let's go

56
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:37,674
Just today, I have taken charge as the head
constable at Ashok Nagar police station.

57
00:09:37,674 --> 00:09:40,966
I was busy with work and so
only informed my sister half an hour ago

58
00:09:40,966 --> 00:09:42,049
that I would be bringing you with me.

59
00:09:42,132 --> 00:09:43,882
Perhaps, that is the reason why
they seem very worried inside.

60
00:09:43,882 --> 00:09:45,132
No problem, Ranganath.

61
00:09:45,382 --> 00:09:48,711
He saw your niece in a function a
while back and has been pestering me to

62
00:09:48,736 --> 00:09:50,490
talk to you about a
possible alliance.

63
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,632
He is leaving to Singapore tomorrow.

64
00:09:53,299 --> 00:09:53,882
Let's go.

65
00:09:54,424 --> 00:09:56,299
Mom, isn't it too early
for me to be married"

66
00:09:56,341 --> 00:09:57,049
Keep quiet.

67
00:09:57,049 --> 00:09:59,224
I have taken a vow that I would visit
Lord Venkateshwara's temple in Tirupati,

68
00:09:59,249 --> 00:10:00,156
if we find you a suitable match.

69
00:10:00,424 --> 00:10:01,986
I will also vow that if
this alliance falls through,

70
00:10:02,011 --> 00:10:03,341
I would visit Lord
Venkateshwara in Tirupati.

71
00:10:03,341 --> 00:10:04,299
Stop spouting nonsense!

72
00:10:04,424 --> 00:10:06,091
Your uncle knows what's best for you.
Let's go.

73
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:09,216
Hello, come this way.

74
00:10:09,882 --> 00:10:12,132
Hello. This is my sister Lalitha.
-Hello

75
00:10:12,882 --> 00:10:15,341
She is working as an Assistant Librarian
at the Central Library.

76
00:10:15,466 --> 00:10:16,632
She is a very good writer as well.

77
00:10:17,716 --> 00:10:19,757
This is my niece, Pallavi.

78
00:10:19,757 --> 00:10:24,216
Her father passed away and my sister
has been taking care of her every need.

79
00:10:26,007 --> 00:10:28,799
I heard that Pallavi is a
state level basketball player.

80
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:29,716
Yes, sir. She is.

81
00:10:41,757 --> 00:10:42,882
Why is he here"

82
00:10:46,466 --> 00:10:49,091
It's been fifteen years
Since I walked out of this house.

83
00:10:49,632 --> 00:10:57,299
The only good memory I have of being here
is of the person beside my mother.

84
00:10:57,424 --> 00:10:59,716
Mani... What brings you here"
Come inside quickly.

85
00:10:59,924 --> 00:11:01,549
I need twenty-five thousand immediately.

86
00:11:02,257 --> 00:11:04,674
Come in. It's pouring outside.
Just come in first.

87
00:11:04,674 --> 00:11:06,091
I won't step into your house ever again.
So, stop pestering me about it

88
00:11:06,091 --> 00:11:08,174
So, stop pestering me about it
I will leave once you give me the money.

89
00:11:08,674 --> 00:11:11,341
Brat! You don't need your mother
but you need her money.

90
00:11:11,341 --> 00:11:11,799
Brother...

91
00:11:11,882 --> 00:11:16,382
Mani... What's this behaviour" How would I
have that kind of money on me right away"

92
00:11:16,424 --> 00:11:18,939
I will try and arrange for it
one way or the other tomorrow.

93
00:11:18,964 --> 00:11:20,406
Just come in.
You are soaking wet.

94
00:11:20,549 --> 00:11:22,466
Don't you understand what I just said"
I need the money right now.

95
00:11:25,549 --> 00:11:28,257
There are guests at home.
Don't create a scene here unnecessarily.

96
00:11:29,007 --> 00:11:30,466
I am not here to make a scene.

97
00:11:30,466 --> 00:11:32,174
If you give me the money,
I will leave right away.

98
00:11:33,132 --> 00:11:34,602
You are supposed to
help your mother out and

99
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,031
take on the responsibility
of your family.

100
00:11:36,132 --> 00:11:39,341
You won't do that anyways.
Why don't you let her stay in peace"

101
00:11:39,507 --> 00:11:42,549
Mom. Just go inside.
I will talk to my brother.

102
00:11:42,549 --> 00:11:43,216
Just stay put. There is no need.

103
00:11:43,216 --> 00:11:45,174
Uncle, just go.
Take mom with you as well.

104
00:11:45,174 --> 00:11:47,674
Mom, go inside.
I will take care of it

105
00:11:48,632 --> 00:11:52,757
What do you want"
Money" Money, right"

106
00:11:52,882 --> 00:11:53,424
Yes.

107
00:11:53,466 --> 00:11:55,924
How much do you need"
Tell me.

108
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,132
Twenty-five thousand.

109
00:12:02,049 --> 00:12:05,299
I will give you the price money that I
saved up after winning the tournament.

110
00:12:05,299 --> 00:12:06,341
I will give it you...

111
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:09,091
Ok", but under one condition.

112
00:12:10,382 --> 00:12:11,500
So, the condition is that,

113
00:12:11,525 --> 00:12:14,382
There is a family here seeking my
hand in a matrimonial alliance.

114
00:12:14,382 --> 00:12:17,757
But I don't want to be married to that guy.
Okay"

115
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,674
Mani... Mani....

116
00:13:49,424 --> 00:13:51,716
Apparently, he left my boy
somewhere in the outskirts.

117
00:13:52,216 --> 00:13:55,549
What's happening, Ranganath"
How is my boy responsible"

118
00:13:56,549 --> 00:14:00,049
Don't worry, sir.
Mani is not angry with your son.

119
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:02,841
If he is angry with anyone,
it is his mother.

120
00:14:03,674 --> 00:14:09,073
Because he was a fatherless
child, his mother pampered him

121
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:12,448
and so,
he turned out very spoiled.

122
00:14:12,549 --> 00:14:13,341
Here.

123
00:14:13,716 --> 00:14:16,091
Once the school gets over, come home
straight. Don't go gallivanting outside.

124
00:14:16,091 --> 00:14:16,882
Yes, mother.

125
00:14:17,507 --> 00:14:20,549
But, unknowingly, when he was young,
he had taken a wrong turn in his life.

126
00:14:20,549 --> 00:14:24,257
Around his school, there was a gang
that sold snacks laced with narcotics

127
00:14:24,507 --> 00:14:27,091
Unwittingly,
Mani got addicted to these narcotics.

128
00:14:27,382 --> 00:14:31,970
To feed that addiction,
he began to forge signatures of parents

129
00:14:31,995 --> 00:14:34,073
on his friend's grade cards.

130
00:14:34,132 --> 00:14:37,091
He changed their scores and
permission slips and charged them.

131
00:14:37,216 --> 00:14:40,632
He missed school to feed his addiction
and spent the entire day on a high.

132
00:14:45,466 --> 00:14:47,216
They found out about this at their school.

133
00:14:47,549 --> 00:14:51,424
Your son is addicted to drugs.
Why don't you take him to therapy"

134
00:14:57,049 --> 00:14:59,257
Your son's condition is a bit critical.

135
00:14:59,424 --> 00:15:02,424
It is better to join him in
Rehabilitation centre immediately.

136
00:15:04,966 --> 00:15:07,341
Mom, please. Mom...
I want to stay with you.

137
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:09,674
Please mom. I will mend my ways.

138
00:15:09,757 --> 00:15:13,299
My sister Lalitha didn't like sending
her son to a rehabilitation centre.

139
00:15:13,632 --> 00:15:16,132
But she was frightened that
the situation would get out of hand.

140
00:15:16,132 --> 00:15:18,632
And so, she joined Mani in a
Rehabilitation centre.

141
00:15:22,549 --> 00:15:23,632
Mother!

142
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:26,216
Because Mani was completely addicted
to narcotics,

143
00:15:26,507 --> 00:15:28,841
he couldn't stay in
the rehabilitation centre for long.

144
00:15:29,216 --> 00:15:31,382
How did you return"

145
00:15:31,382 --> 00:15:33,299
I can't stay there, mother.
I want to live with you.

146
00:15:33,549 --> 00:15:36,049
Listen to me baby.
Finish your treatment.

147
00:15:36,049 --> 00:15:37,257
I won't go there.

148
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:43,331
Madam, your son has forged my
signature on discharge sheet

149
00:15:43,356 --> 00:15:45,031
and gate pass. He ran away.

150
00:15:45,966 --> 00:15:49,299
Doctor, can I please let him stay
with me for a while"

151
00:15:49,341 --> 00:15:51,799
No. That's not a good idea.
Get him here immediately.

152
00:15:51,882 --> 00:15:54,174
It would be impossible for him to get back
to normalcy if he isn't treated now.

153
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:01,257
Mani...
Why are you sitting here"

154
00:16:01,257 --> 00:16:03,132
Lalitha considered letting her
son stay with her for some time...

155
00:16:03,132 --> 00:16:07,216
but his behaviour at home, strengthened
her decision to send him to Rehab.

156
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:11,341
And so, she sent her
pampered son back to Rehab.

157
00:16:11,757 --> 00:16:16,757
Leave me alone.
Leave me.

158
00:16:29,924 --> 00:16:31,594
Mani misinterpreted his
mother's actions and

159
00:16:31,619 --> 00:16:34,007
immaturely attributed the blame
for his situation to his mother.

160
00:16:34,007 --> 00:16:35,966
He hasn't spoken to her since.

161
00:16:38,674 --> 00:16:41,591
Whenever Lalitha went to visit her son,
he refused to see her.

162
00:16:44,466 --> 00:16:48,632
To get Mani off addiction, the doctors at
Rehab resorted to some extreme methods.

163
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,924
Those brutal treatments and the crushing
loneliness he felt at the Rehab centre

164
00:16:51,949 --> 00:16:52,865
turned him into a stone.

165
00:17:00,007 --> 00:17:01,942
He spent three years
in that centre.

166
00:17:01,967 --> 00:17:05,156
But one fine day,
he escaped from the Rehabilitation centre.

167
00:17:08,507 --> 00:17:11,382
Later, no matter however hard we tried,
we could never persuade him to come home.

168
00:17:12,091 --> 00:17:15,299
He didn't understand his mother's love
and gradually grew distant from her.

169
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:17,757
We only wished for him to be happy
wherever he was.

170
00:17:17,966 --> 00:17:21,174
But, our fears were
once again renewed when

171
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,698
Mani became a DJ in a
club that supplied drugs.

172
00:18:24,775 --> 00:18:26,692
Mani... Hey, Mani.

173
00:18:26,692 --> 00:18:29,567
Why would you hand over
the DJ console to your guy"

174
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,025
You are ruining your career
with that attitude of yours.

175
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:35,609
Gambling! Gambling! Gambling!
That is all you want to do.

176
00:18:35,609 --> 00:18:37,447
You lose money gambling
and go home to your mother

177
00:18:37,472 --> 00:18:38,817
and harass her to
give you the money.

178
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:40,734
Don't you realize the kind of suffering
you are inflicting on your family"

179
00:18:40,734 --> 00:18:43,817
Did she complain that I harassed
her about money"

180
00:18:44,109 --> 00:18:45,609
That is exactly how she is!

181
00:18:46,109 --> 00:18:48,150
You have completely
misunderstood your mother.

182
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,861
I met your uncle yesterday in
the market and he was the one who

183
00:18:49,886 --> 00:18:50,633
told me about the argument.

184
00:18:51,234 --> 00:18:54,890
I worked with her for six years.
All of us know the kind of person she is.

185
00:18:54,915 --> 00:18:56,133
Except you, of course!

186
00:19:03,859 --> 00:19:07,900
Mani, I told you that I have feelings for
you. Why isn't there any answer from you"

187
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:11,942
Why do you keep avoiding me"
Am I lacking in some way"

188
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:15,650
If I like a girl, it should be like an
addiction It shouldn't be like wham, bam

189
00:19:15,734 --> 00:19:18,359
Why don't you give me a go"
Maybe you would be addicted to me.

190
00:19:19,275 --> 00:19:22,338
You" I should have gotten that
feeling the very first time I met you.

191
00:19:22,363 --> 00:19:23,383
Try to understand"

192
00:19:42,525 --> 00:19:46,304
This hardly weighs three
grams But when consumed,

193
00:19:46,329 --> 00:19:49,049
it's high is
equivalent to 30 tons.

194
00:19:50,859 --> 00:19:54,025
It's impossible to control me when
I am on that high.

195
00:19:54,025 --> 00:19:55,442
I was once a slave to this substance.

196
00:19:55,567 --> 00:19:59,484
And even if I am tempted now,
my past keeps reminding me to say no to it.

197
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:21,025
How can you help me, madam"
-What "

198
00:20:21,025 --> 00:20:22,275
Wait. I'll handle it.
-We need a room.

199
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,192
Are you both married"

200
00:20:23,275 --> 00:20:24,400
Well, the thing is...

201
00:20:24,484 --> 00:20:25,359
I get it.

202
00:20:25,775 --> 00:20:27,734
Please don't give me excuses such as
car failure, missed the last bus,

203
00:20:27,734 --> 00:20:31,109
she has an exam tomorrow, I can't
reach my friend, Please help us, etc.

204
00:20:31,109 --> 00:20:32,275
No, I am not going to give such excuses.

205
00:20:32,275 --> 00:20:35,442
Really" No such excuses"
-You would proceed to the room directly"

206
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:36,525
It's a suite. It's amazing.
Go on.

207
00:20:36,525 --> 00:20:38,942
What's with this unfair treatment"
When we go to the park, the police object.

208
00:20:38,942 --> 00:20:40,359
In the theatre, the staff objects.

209
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:41,442
On the road,
people will probably throw stones

210
00:20:41,442 --> 00:20:42,817
And If I want to take her home,
my wife wouldn't agree

211
00:20:42,817 --> 00:20:43,900
Where do you want me to take her"

212
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,609
You mean to say that the youth face
such kind of problems"

213
00:20:45,609 --> 00:20:47,270
Even though I don't like your face,
I like the amount of dedication

214
00:20:47,295 --> 00:20:48,150
you have shown to
the task at hand.

215
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,650
Thank you, sir.
-May god bless you, buddy.

216
00:20:49,984 --> 00:20:50,650
Come on, move along.

217
00:20:52,442 --> 00:20:55,734
Don't know if the passion he has shown
outside will prevail in the bedroom"

218
00:20:57,734 --> 00:20:59,400
Buddy, why are you here
instead of at the pub"

219
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,275
No. Don't take out any money.
I will have to show accounts to the owner.

220
00:21:02,275 --> 00:21:02,734
So, show accounts.

221
00:21:02,734 --> 00:21:04,442
You take the money.
And he takes the girl.

222
00:21:04,442 --> 00:21:05,567
What do you want me to do"
Sell balloons"

223
00:21:05,567 --> 00:21:06,109
Sure, why not"

224
00:21:06,109 --> 00:21:08,650
You are such an opportunist!
It's tough to understand.

225
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:09,400
Key..

226
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,680
The high that I experience in
this darkness is the only thing

227
00:21:26,705 --> 00:21:28,091
that gives my
loneliness company.

228
00:21:28,234 --> 00:21:33,317
That is the reason why I wake up when it's
dark and sleep before the darkness fades.

229
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:35,942
Everybody thinks I am someone
they can't figure out

230
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:40,400
It doesn't matter what they think
I only do what I want to.

231
00:22:29,567 --> 00:22:33,859
Joseph here is a cricket bookie
and he is quite dangerous.

232
00:22:34,275 --> 00:22:36,859
All the bets that I have made recently,
we're not successful.

233
00:22:37,317 --> 00:22:38,984
And that means, I owe him 30 lakhs.

234
00:22:39,234 --> 00:22:41,067
I don't have a single penny.

235
00:22:47,109 --> 00:22:50,984
If I need to escape him,
I need to risk my life.

236
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,359
Uh! Looks like I've been caught.

237
00:23:08,275 --> 00:23:09,984
Crook! Do you think this is a game"

238
00:23:10,192 --> 00:23:12,859
You have gambled in so many matches.
Just ‘cause you were a regular customer,

239
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:14,359
I loaned you the money.
Are you planning to escape"

240
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:17,317
Sorry, bro. I was just calling you
but my phone died.

241
00:23:17,317 --> 00:23:20,067
You! It's not a small amount.
It's 30 lakhs.

242
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,692
Brother, I will definitely return it.
-When"

243
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:23,775
Just give me some time, please.

244
00:23:23,775 --> 00:23:26,442
Why did you gamble such huge amounts,
when you had no money"

245
00:23:27,442 --> 00:23:28,775
Bro, give me some time, please.

246
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:31,817
I am giving you two months.

247
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:33,317
Brother...time means....

248
00:23:33,734 --> 00:23:34,775
I meant not just two months...

249
00:23:34,817 --> 00:23:35,900
At the least, give me six months, please.

250
00:23:37,192 --> 00:23:38,150
Two months.

251
00:23:39,109 --> 00:23:43,567
Even if you die, I am going to extract
that money from you.

252
00:24:08,942 --> 00:24:11,317
I am giving you two months.

253
00:24:18,442 --> 00:24:20,984
Hi. you are DJ Mani, right"

254
00:24:21,442 --> 00:24:23,900
I saw you quite a few times
while jogging here.

255
00:24:24,525 --> 00:24:25,900
By the way, I am Mounika.

256
00:24:26,484 --> 00:24:27,692
Can I tell you something"

257
00:24:28,317 --> 00:24:30,067
I am a big fan of yours.

258
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:32,400
Not just me. All my friends too.

259
00:24:32,484 --> 00:24:34,692
Whenever we feel like partying,
we always come to your pub.

260
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,234
What is it" Why aren't you saying anything"

261
00:24:38,692 --> 00:24:41,442
Alright, fine.
You seem to be in a different space.

262
00:24:41,442 --> 00:24:44,109
What"! What's with this nonsense
so early in the morning"

263
00:24:44,609 --> 00:24:46,817
What" I just wanted to say hi because
you are such a familiar face.

264
00:24:46,817 --> 00:24:47,525
How rude!

265
00:24:47,609 --> 00:24:48,692
Alright, fine.
Bye.

266
00:24:49,567 --> 00:24:51,025
Hey, wait!
Give me your phone.

267
00:24:51,234 --> 00:24:53,609
Why"
-Give it.

268
00:25:04,692 --> 00:25:06,692
We don't have any rooms available.
-Kaaki, it's me.

269
00:25:06,692 --> 00:25:08,567
I heard Joseph cause a scene"
Yes.

270
00:25:08,567 --> 00:25:10,900
Leave that.
I will tell you all about it later.

271
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:13,205
Tomorrow and the day after,I
won't be making it to the pub.

272
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,067
Ask Yogi to fill in for me.

273
00:25:14,067 --> 00:25:16,275
Alright. Be careful.
-Okay.

274
00:25:20,942 --> 00:25:22,817
Is this your photo"
-Yes. It is.

275
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:54,025
Hey!

276
00:26:37,942 --> 00:26:41,234
I don't know who you are but you
have shown me light after many years.

277
00:26:44,859 --> 00:26:46,775
The crowd last night at the pub
was completely rowdy.

278
00:26:46,817 --> 00:26:49,525
How is it that he is here this early in
the morning" Looks like he is sober now.

279
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:52,234
Oh my! This is new. Looks like you
have greeted the sun today. What's up"

280
00:26:52,234 --> 00:26:53,609
I was bored of the moon.

281
00:26:53,734 --> 00:26:54,359
Oh, really"

282
00:26:55,234 --> 00:26:56,442
He is weird for sure.

283
00:26:56,609 --> 00:27:00,067
Tell me... Who is that girl"
Where does she live" What does she do"

284
00:27:00,067 --> 00:27:02,817
Buddy, give it a second thought.
You might have seen her in the night

285
00:27:02,817 --> 00:27:05,567
Nonsense!
I like that girl.

286
00:27:05,609 --> 00:27:09,359
Buddy, after so long!
Finally, you are young and alive.

287
00:27:15,525 --> 00:27:17,109
So, do you think that the
girl would be here or not"

288
00:27:17,109 --> 00:27:18,817
She is here to work out
every morning at this time.

289
00:27:18,859 --> 00:27:21,067
But you sleep at this time and
she wakes up at this hour

290
00:27:21,234 --> 00:27:24,859
When you are awake, she is sleep.
Both of you are from different time zones.

291
00:27:25,025 --> 00:27:27,400
Never mind all that.
Do you even know her name"

292
00:27:27,984 --> 00:27:28,775
Mounika.

293
00:27:28,775 --> 00:27:30,484
Oh goodness, that is a lot of information.

294
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:32,775
Does she have any friends"

295
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,775
There. There she is.

296
00:27:34,942 --> 00:27:37,067
No matter how big a fan you are.
Is it appropriate to approach her directly"

297
00:27:37,275 --> 00:27:39,942
Buddy, who is that"
Looks old but young.

298
00:27:39,984 --> 00:27:42,150
Looks like she is the
perfect fit for this Kaaki.

299
00:27:42,192 --> 00:27:44,317
It's debatable whether this
girl will date you or not

300
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:46,442
But, I on the other hand, will certainly
date the one beside her.

301
00:27:48,692 --> 00:27:50,275
I told you right,
that's DJ Mani.

302
00:27:51,942 --> 00:27:52,859
I want to talk to you in private.

303
00:27:52,859 --> 00:27:54,150
I want to talk to her in private as well.

304
00:27:58,692 --> 00:27:59,984
What do you do"

305
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:03,275
She works in the police department.
She is training to be a Sub-Inspector.

306
00:28:04,692 --> 00:28:06,359
Buddy, don't fret it.
I'll manage.

307
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:08,775
Chubby lady,
what do you do"

308
00:28:09,567 --> 00:28:12,525
If you ask her it's alright and if I ask
her, it's wrong. Is it" This is wrong.

309
00:28:12,734 --> 00:28:13,234
Let's go.

310
00:28:13,234 --> 00:28:18,400
Hey! Wait. One second. This is important.
In this small little world...

311
00:28:18,609 --> 00:28:20,390
Buddy! Stop with those lectures.
I have been listening to this stuff

312
00:28:20,415 --> 00:28:21,008
right from childhood.

313
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,900
I mean to say...
she might not be that patient.

314
00:28:24,484 --> 00:28:25,192
Nothing...

315
00:28:25,275 --> 00:28:25,817
Yo...

316
00:28:29,984 --> 00:28:33,317
I never thought that I would
ask a girl out in the middle of the road.

317
00:28:33,609 --> 00:28:34,775
This is new even for me.

318
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:40,400
My world is surrounded by darkness,
machines all around and loud noises.

319
00:28:41,109 --> 00:28:42,400
I am surrounded by loneliness.

320
00:28:43,609 --> 00:28:45,442
My life didn't have anything
remarkable about it.

321
00:28:46,234 --> 00:28:47,567
I thought this was my fate.

322
00:28:48,109 --> 00:28:50,067
But ever since I saw you,
I am drawn to you.

323
00:28:52,067 --> 00:28:53,907
This isn't exactly a
confession or a proposal.

324
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:55,341
In fact,
I don't know what love is.

325
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,551
It's just that I like you.
And if you feel the same,

326
00:28:59,576 --> 00:29:00,883
We could get married.

327
00:29:02,484 --> 00:29:04,150
Give it a lot of thought
and give me an answer.

328
00:29:07,692 --> 00:29:10,900
I just saw you only once before. And that's
enough for me to make this declaration.

329
00:29:11,109 --> 00:29:13,577
You told me that you have seen me many
times Besides, you also told me that

330
00:29:13,602 --> 00:29:14,400
you have been my fan.

331
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,150
Think about it
and let me know your decision.

332
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:22,400
I told her;

333
00:29:22,734 --> 00:29:23,692
In fact, everything that was on my mind.

334
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:27,984
You aren't the person to ever
hide your feelings. Well done!

335
00:29:35,067 --> 00:29:39,984
" Oh lord Krishna and his consort;
thus, began the struggle"

336
00:29:39,984 --> 00:29:44,775
" It's a sweet story where
the lovers unite in time"

337
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:49,442
Pallavi! Your brother Mani has
fallen in love with that girl.

338
00:29:49,567 --> 00:29:50,817
Why don't you try and help them"

339
00:29:51,692 --> 00:29:54,025
One of our team members quit.

340
00:29:54,109 --> 00:29:55,775
So, what should we do"

341
00:29:56,109 --> 00:29:57,317
Well, there's my brother.

342
00:29:57,317 --> 00:29:59,109
How can a guy play in a woman's team"

343
00:29:59,234 --> 00:30:01,150
I will ask him to play with a single hand.

344
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:01,775
Okay..

345
00:30:03,859 --> 00:30:08,567
" The time has asked
for a leave of absence"

346
00:30:08,567 --> 00:30:12,192
" She lost all sense of herself. "

347
00:30:13,567 --> 00:30:23,067
" My other half that walks alongside
me, in my thoughts, "

348
00:30:23,067 --> 00:30:27,359
" The truth that my
eyes seek is your love "

349
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:32,359
" Stands in front of me
in the shape of you "

350
00:30:52,234 --> 00:30:54,484
Don't you ever shave"

351
00:30:54,484 --> 00:30:56,775
Maybe it's about being stylish
or just a habit. Take your pick.

352
00:30:57,317 --> 00:30:59,067
But this will remain so.

353
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:01,484
Why, you ask"
I like myself this way.

354
00:31:01,692 --> 00:31:11,192
" I have shed all my inhibitions
and journeyed with you "

355
00:31:11,192 --> 00:31:20,817
" Left behind my petty anger
and started to notice you "

356
00:31:20,817 --> 00:31:29,109
" Every minute I've spent in your
company, " " leaving past behind "

357
00:31:30,192 --> 00:31:33,150
" is a precious treasure of mine "

358
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:37,859
I can see that Mani has changed.
He is punctual and sociable.

359
00:31:37,859 --> 00:31:42,484
It doesn't matter where he is, Koti.
As long as he stays away from drugs.

360
00:31:43,859 --> 00:31:52,817
" My other half that walks alongside
me, in my thoughts, "

361
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:59,355
" The truth that my eyes
seek is your love "

362
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:04,841
Stands in front of me,
in the shape of you "

363
00:32:05,525 --> 00:32:07,074
Just because your son
likes Brinjal curry,

364
00:32:07,099 --> 00:32:08,984
do you think it's fair to
force us to eat only this"

365
00:32:08,984 --> 00:32:10,150
He isn't here, right"

366
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:11,775
Why" Are you under the impression
that he won't ever come here"

367
00:32:11,775 --> 00:32:15,192
Wait and watch. Someday,
my son is going to come back home for me.

368
00:32:15,692 --> 00:32:19,650
I don't know about that but apparently
your son has fallen in love with a girl.

369
00:32:19,692 --> 00:32:21,942
And she is a police officer in training.

370
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:34,192
" This blossoming
friendliness feels strange "

371
00:32:34,484 --> 00:32:44,025
" It's no longer a dream,
it has a voice and its true "

372
00:32:44,025 --> 00:32:48,777
" After so long, have you stopped
listening to my voice and "

373
00:32:48,802 --> 00:32:52,633
" Started listening to
the silence in my heart"

374
00:32:54,859 --> 00:32:56,275
My uncle will be coming tomorrow.

375
00:32:56,359 --> 00:32:59,192
And ever since I lost my parents,
I grew up in his household.

376
00:32:59,192 --> 00:33:00,275
Alright, fine.
Shall we play a game"

377
00:33:00,275 --> 00:33:00,984
Game"

378
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,109
So, the game is that
we would get in a car...

379
00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:05,984
and roll up the windows...

380
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,484
I don't think I should tell you more.
-How about I show you now" Let's go.

381
00:33:07,484 --> 00:33:08,484
What a pervert!
Stop that!

382
00:33:10,942 --> 00:33:12,109
Alright, fine.
Shall we meet tomorrow"

383
00:33:12,275 --> 00:33:14,025
Well, if you want to meet, I'll be there
If it's for games, I won't come.

384
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:14,900
Okay, fine.

385
00:33:15,109 --> 00:33:17,067
She doesn't encourages games!

386
00:33:17,067 --> 00:33:23,150
" Stands in front of
me, in the shape of you"

387
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,400
Hey! Who are you guys"
Why did you bring me here"

388
00:34:19,984 --> 00:34:20,900
Anybody is there"

389
00:34:21,734 --> 00:34:26,400
I will give you two months of time
Pay up. Or else, even if you die,

390
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,609
I am going to extract that money from you.

391
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,109
Joseph! Joseph!

392
00:34:32,234 --> 00:34:34,734
Give me a chance.
I will return your money. Please.

393
00:36:39,692 --> 00:36:43,109
Buddy, where have you been"
I would have given your company.

394
00:36:43,442 --> 00:36:45,192
I looked all over for you.

395
00:36:46,484 --> 00:36:50,650
I was so upset when I couldn't find you
and so, I am stress-eating Biryani.

396
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:54,525
Come and play two songs. I love to hear
you play when I am having my biryani.

397
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:56,692
Would you like to have some water"

398
00:37:06,984 --> 00:37:08,359
Shall I order another Biryani"

399
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:25,400
Hello

400
00:37:25,567 --> 00:37:28,609
So, DJ" How's it going"

401
00:37:30,817 --> 00:37:32,859
You must be wondering
how I got out so early.

402
00:37:33,025 --> 00:37:35,609
I gave you two months to pay me back
my money. And in that two months,

403
00:37:35,692 --> 00:37:38,442
not once have you thought about me.

404
00:37:38,442 --> 00:37:41,692
That is why, in these seven days,
I made sure that you would remember me.

405
00:37:41,775 --> 00:37:45,317
I am going to stay in your head
for as long as you are alive.

406
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:46,442
Listen carefully.

407
00:37:46,567 --> 00:37:48,817
I am going to give you 20 days.

408
00:37:48,942 --> 00:37:51,192
If you don't pay up,
you will never come back.

409
00:37:51,275 --> 00:37:55,234
Keep that in mind.
Last twenty days.

410
00:38:07,229 --> 00:38:09,104
It's difficult to arrange for 30 lakhs.

411
00:38:09,604 --> 00:38:11,521
They told us that it's not possible.

412
00:38:13,229 --> 00:38:15,937
Well, there is another way. But –

413
00:38:15,937 --> 00:38:16,562
What is that"

414
00:38:18,937 --> 00:38:21,187
There is a spot available in a
gambling game in Vikarabad forest.

415
00:38:21,396 --> 00:38:23,229
Remember Old city Surya"

416
00:38:23,604 --> 00:38:25,479
He is an illegal bookie
who organizes a big pot every year.

417
00:38:25,521 --> 00:38:27,396
If you win that,
all your problems would be solved.

418
00:38:28,271 --> 00:38:31,646
I mean... there is a small catch.

419
00:38:32,104 --> 00:38:34,229
Everyone who wants to participate
has to deposit 3 lakhs.

420
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:37,146
There is a saying – the father is penniless
but the son demands pounds.

421
00:38:37,562 --> 00:38:38,312
It's not Joseph who is dangerous.

422
00:38:38,312 --> 00:38:39,354
This guy here is.
Stay far away from him.

423
00:38:39,687 --> 00:38:40,729
Stop prattling!

424
00:38:40,771 --> 00:38:42,896
We don't have a single penny on us.
How could you ask us for 3 lakhs"

425
00:38:43,062 --> 00:38:44,771
If you can win the pot with just
three lakhs of investment,

426
00:38:44,771 --> 00:38:46,937
after the bookie takes his commission,
you would still be left with 20 lakhs.

427
00:38:47,312 --> 00:38:48,479
Who would give you this offer"

428
00:38:49,062 --> 00:38:51,146
Who is going to give us 3 lakhs"

429
00:38:57,396 --> 00:38:58,312
What's up, Mani"

430
00:38:58,562 --> 00:38:59,812
Why didn't you go to your room yet"

431
00:39:03,021 --> 00:39:04,354
Koti, I need your help.

432
00:39:04,479 --> 00:39:06,687
You are Lalitha's son.
Why wouldn't I help you"

433
00:39:06,896 --> 00:39:07,854
The thing is...

434
00:39:08,896 --> 00:39:11,979
I heard that recently you've come into some
money. I need to borrow 3 lakhs from you.

435
00:39:11,979 --> 00:39:13,479
It's quite urgent.
Can you lend it to me"

436
00:39:21,729 --> 00:39:24,396
Mani, after you left,
I thought about it a lot.

437
00:39:24,687 --> 00:39:27,521
Your mom always helped our family
when we were in need.

438
00:39:28,062 --> 00:39:30,896
And so, due to the goodwill she has in our
family I am unable to refuse your request.

439
00:39:32,771 --> 00:39:34,021
Here are 3 lakhs.

440
00:39:34,146 --> 00:39:35,771
It's my entire year's savings.

441
00:39:35,979 --> 00:39:38,062
My father's been going through some
difficulties at his house in the village.

442
00:39:38,062 --> 00:39:39,812
I wanted to help him repair his house
and so, had saved up this money.

443
00:39:40,937 --> 00:39:41,896
Use it wisely.

444
00:39:44,687 --> 00:39:46,226
I am not lending it to
you because I trust you.

445
00:39:46,251 --> 00:39:48,045
It is solely out of the
respect I have for your mother.

446
00:39:48,312 --> 00:39:49,271
Remember that.

447
00:40:13,521 --> 00:40:16,646
Hello Mani.
Welcome to the Jungle.

448
00:40:17,812 --> 00:40:19,562
Oh my lord!
How did you find this place"

449
00:40:19,562 --> 00:40:21,604
I am sure even google
will not be able to locate it.

450
00:40:21,604 --> 00:40:22,146
You shut it.

451
00:40:22,271 --> 00:40:24,562
These kind of illegal activities
happen in places such as these.

452
00:40:24,896 --> 00:40:27,271
Neither the police nor the villagers
ever come here.

453
00:40:27,812 --> 00:40:29,812
They already get their share of money.

454
00:40:29,979 --> 00:40:31,687
Does this forest have any wild animals"

455
00:40:31,812 --> 00:40:33,562
Humans are more dangerous than animals.

456
00:40:48,354 --> 00:40:52,312
Brother, what should we do with the girl"

457
00:40:52,312 --> 00:40:53,854
Is she my wife"
Why would I want her around"

458
00:40:53,854 --> 00:40:55,896
We are done with her. Send her away.

459
00:40:56,021 --> 00:40:59,146
Here. Take Rs.20,000 here.
Give it to her.

460
00:40:59,146 --> 00:40:59,771
Okay..

461
00:41:03,187 --> 00:41:04,146
A profit of 10,000.

462
00:41:08,021 --> 00:41:09,104
Here is Rs.10,000.

463
00:41:09,354 --> 00:41:10,729
I said Rs.20,000"

464
00:41:11,104 --> 00:41:13,396
You are paid according to your service.
Maybe you didn't do a good job.

465
00:41:13,396 --> 00:41:15,354
Buddy, staying here is quite risky.
Take the girl away from here.

466
00:41:15,396 --> 00:41:16,854
Okay"

467
00:41:20,229 --> 00:41:21,729
What's all this"

468
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,979
The pot goes in lakhs.
Is isn't a joke.

469
00:41:24,521 --> 00:41:26,354
Hey.
Look at him.

470
00:41:26,646 --> 00:41:27,937
Oh dear lord!
How is he this huge"

471
00:41:28,104 --> 00:41:30,146
Is he a product of an
elephant and a giraffe mating"

472
00:41:30,229 --> 00:41:31,562
That guy's name is Kali.

473
00:41:31,687 --> 00:41:33,646
He is last year's winner.
He won the pot worth 20 lakhs.

474
00:41:34,021 --> 00:41:36,271
What"! Who is this"
Is he even human"

475
00:41:38,646 --> 00:41:41,562
Mani"
What brings you here"

476
00:41:41,896 --> 00:41:44,146
This isn't some local street gambling.

477
00:41:44,354 --> 00:41:49,021
This is at another whole new level.
Anyways, this game is for men.

478
00:41:52,229 --> 00:41:54,479
You are one cheapskate who
couldn't even win small local bets.

479
00:41:54,479 --> 00:41:56,062
Why would you think so highly of yourself"

480
00:41:56,521 --> 00:42:00,812
Anyways being a man doesn't just mean
having a moustache or a beard.

481
00:42:01,312 --> 00:42:08,104
Come and have a go.
Let's see if you win or I win.

482
00:42:17,062 --> 00:42:18,729
Okay, guys. Let's start the game.

483
00:42:19,854 --> 00:42:22,771
This is a very thick forest.
And it's dark all around.

484
00:42:22,854 --> 00:42:25,214
And in this forest,
underneath a tree,

485
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:27,961
There is a packet
containing 20 lakhs in it.

486
00:42:28,021 --> 00:42:29,604
20 lakhs.

487
00:42:33,062 --> 00:42:36,170
Whoever can find that
packet of 20 lakhs first,

488
00:42:36,195 --> 00:42:37,878
and blows the conch shell

489
00:42:38,062 --> 00:42:39,604
the money belongs to him.

490
00:42:39,687 --> 00:42:40,979
I will give you guys a clue.

491
00:42:42,896 --> 00:42:46,937
There is a red cloth tied to the tree.
But there is a twist.

492
00:42:47,146 --> 00:42:50,937
There are 67 trees with red cloth
tied around them in this forest.

493
00:42:50,937 --> 00:42:52,437
67 trees.

494
00:42:52,437 --> 00:42:55,317
Of which you need to figure out
Just the one tree with a red cloth

495
00:42:55,342 --> 00:42:56,545
that has 20 lakhs under it.

496
00:42:56,771 --> 00:43:00,676
In this dark and dangerous
game, this is truly a test

497
00:43:00,701 --> 00:43:04,461
of your intelligence,
will power and determination.

498
00:43:05,021 --> 00:43:07,479
Are you guys ready"
-Ready.

499
00:43:07,687 --> 00:43:10,146
Are you guys ready"
-Ready.

500
00:43:10,146 --> 00:43:12,271
Then, let's go!

501
00:45:02,521 --> 00:45:05,062
Aren't you ashamed to take
this amount of beating"

502
00:47:12,896 --> 00:47:13,687
Kali...

503
00:47:15,187 --> 00:47:18,562
Brother, he has stolen 20 lakhs.
How will we let it go"

504
00:47:20,771 --> 00:47:22,229
Where can we find that Kali fellow"

505
00:47:23,271 --> 00:47:27,771
We conduct illegal games clandestinely
We don't have details of the participants

506
00:47:28,354 --> 00:47:30,771
We don't know anything remarkable
about that Kali fellow.

507
00:47:31,187 --> 00:47:34,146
I don't know what means you would use
but if you can catch him outside,

508
00:47:34,146 --> 00:47:35,312
I want you to grab the money from him.

509
00:47:35,437 --> 00:47:37,229
Take my man with you
he could be of some help.

510
00:47:52,396 --> 00:47:54,687
Chinna, did you see Kali around"

511
00:47:54,687 --> 00:47:55,562
No, brother.

512
00:47:55,562 --> 00:47:56,437
Where can I find him"

513
00:47:56,437 --> 00:47:57,271
No idea..

514
00:48:14,979 --> 00:48:16,562
Mani, looks like they don't know either.

515
00:48:16,771 --> 00:48:19,604
They say that he must have run away
to Malaysia or Bangkok.

516
00:48:30,021 --> 00:48:33,146
You gambled"
Did you lose the money"

517
00:48:36,271 --> 00:48:41,271
I made a mistake, Mani. The only thing that
truly shows a person's character is money.

518
00:48:41,854 --> 00:48:45,271
I knew about your character and yet I
gave you the money. That was my mistake.

519
00:48:45,812 --> 00:48:47,521
At any cost, I will return your
money to you. -Stop right there.

520
00:48:49,604 --> 00:48:51,437
I don't even know what to say to you, Mani.

521
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:05,062
Despite all the years that have passed, you
remembered Koti and have come to see him.

522
00:49:05,604 --> 00:49:10,104
He was a very sociable person
and now, he is crippled.

523
00:49:10,271 --> 00:49:12,687
Last year,
he suffered a stroke of Paralysis.

524
00:49:26,729 --> 00:49:30,979
Koti doesn't wish to speak to you.
What happened between you two"

525
00:49:31,812 --> 00:49:34,437
I am but a mere human.
I made a mistake.

526
00:49:40,937 --> 00:49:42,521
Why is there cash in here"

527
00:49:45,979 --> 00:49:47,521
There're 6 lakhs here.

528
00:50:18,271 --> 00:50:21,771
why are you so late" It's been a while
since the felicitation ceremony began.

529
00:50:21,854 --> 00:50:23,437
Felicitation" For whom"

530
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:26,437
Your mom won the national prize for the
book she had written. It's called ‘Sisuvu'.

531
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:29,354
The felicitation ceremony is for your
mother. What a useless son you are!

532
00:50:29,354 --> 00:50:30,312
Go on.

533
00:50:32,562 --> 00:50:33,562
Thank you, sir.

534
00:50:35,229 --> 00:50:42,062
This book is a story about a nine-day old
baby who was abandoned in a village.

535
00:50:42,187 --> 00:50:48,106
It was being dragged away by dogs
when the villagers rescued the baby

536
00:50:48,131 --> 00:50:50,836
and gave the baby an education.

537
00:50:51,062 --> 00:50:56,104
The boy works hard at academics and becomes
a civil servant and returns to the village.

538
00:50:56,354 --> 00:50:59,812
He uplifts the village
and repays their kindness.

539
00:50:59,979 --> 00:51:04,812
Put simply, it is a textbook on the
meaning of kindness and humaneness.

540
00:51:10,604 --> 00:51:12,896
Wonderfully written, Lalitha
You have done a fabulous job.

541
00:51:12,896 --> 00:51:13,771
Thank you, sir.

542
00:51:13,771 --> 00:51:14,687
Please address the audience.

543
00:51:16,146 --> 00:51:17,354
Hello to everyone...

544
00:51:18,187 --> 00:51:21,396
My husband is the primary reason why
I wrote this book.

545
00:51:21,812 --> 00:51:23,062
He isn't here with us anymore.

546
00:51:23,896 --> 00:51:27,771
Even when I was working,
he encouraged me to write this book.

547
00:51:28,896 --> 00:51:32,267
When our children achieve
something, We are indeed very happy

548
00:51:32,292 --> 00:51:34,086
and proud of their achievements.

549
00:51:34,479 --> 00:51:37,812
At the same time, as a mother, I hope
that my achievements ...

550
00:51:49,687 --> 00:51:51,896
...make my children happy

551
00:51:53,396 --> 00:51:54,104
Thank you.

552
00:52:02,937 --> 00:52:07,146
Mani... You are here.
I am quite happy.

553
00:52:07,604 --> 00:52:11,937
They announced this award in the morning.
I cannot believe it.

554
00:52:11,937 --> 00:52:13,437
I need 40 lakhs.

555
00:52:15,771 --> 00:52:16,937
What are you saying"

556
00:52:17,646 --> 00:52:20,812
You heard me right.
I need the money urgently.

557
00:52:21,062 --> 00:52:23,271
What are you doing here"

558
00:52:23,437 --> 00:52:25,271
Hey, Don't interfere.

559
00:52:26,146 --> 00:52:28,396
I want my share in the property.
Transfer it to me in writing.

560
00:52:28,396 --> 00:52:30,104
Watch what you're saying!
Do you realise where you are"

561
00:52:30,104 --> 00:52:31,771
I know the etiquette very well.

562
00:52:31,771 --> 00:52:32,354
Mani...

563
00:52:32,354 --> 00:52:33,604
You just shut it and
mind your own business.

564
00:52:33,854 --> 00:52:36,687
Give me my share of the property. -Mani...
Why do you need that kind of money"

565
00:52:36,937 --> 00:52:40,562
Let's talk about this later.
Please listen to me and...

566
00:52:40,562 --> 00:52:42,604
No, I don't give a damn!
Give me my money.

567
00:52:42,937 --> 00:52:45,771
Mani... please...
Right now...We ...

568
00:52:46,021 --> 00:52:47,271
You will receive no property or money.

569
00:52:47,271 --> 00:52:48,354
Mani... let's talk about it later.
Just get lost from here.

570
00:52:48,562 --> 00:52:50,979
I will not take a single step until
I get an answer.

571
00:52:51,937 --> 00:52:53,104
I want my property.

572
00:52:53,104 --> 00:52:55,521
You are making a scene.

573
00:52:55,521 --> 00:52:56,312
Not my problem. Let them look.

574
00:52:56,312 --> 00:52:57,354
Big brother, let me deal with this.

575
00:53:00,437 --> 00:53:03,312
What happened exactly"
Let's deal with this at home.

576
00:53:03,312 --> 00:53:03,771
Leave me.

577
00:53:22,812 --> 00:53:28,812
Mani, I only have this much amount
in the bank. I only have 5 lakhs.

578
00:53:28,812 --> 00:53:29,729
Could we...

579
00:53:29,729 --> 00:53:32,771
Are throwing pennies at a beggar"
You want to treat your son like a beggar"

580
00:53:33,646 --> 00:53:37,146
I only have this much with me.
Where can I get money from"

581
00:53:37,146 --> 00:53:37,687
Mani...

582
00:53:37,979 --> 00:53:40,146
How can you speak that way"
I only have...

583
00:53:40,687 --> 00:53:42,937
Mani... we only have...

584
00:53:42,937 --> 00:53:44,146
That's not my problem...
-Sir, let go outside.

585
00:53:44,146 --> 00:53:44,896
Take your hands off me.

586
00:53:44,896 --> 00:53:46,937
We can't have you creating a scene inside.
Take it outside.

587
00:53:47,021 --> 00:53:48,187
Come out, Sir.
-Our son...

588
00:54:01,729 --> 00:54:03,146
How long should we bear him"

589
00:54:15,771 --> 00:54:18,646
Hi...Pallavi
-Hi...

590
00:54:20,146 --> 00:54:24,562
What's wrong" What's with this scar"
Tell me.

591
00:54:24,562 --> 00:54:29,562
The thing is...my brother created a scene
at the library and that disturbed me a lot.

592
00:54:30,146 --> 00:54:33,187
Well, I was lost in thought and was
walking down the road to our academy.

593
00:54:33,229 --> 00:54:37,271
I felt someone pull me from behind
and even before I could react,

594
00:54:37,271 --> 00:54:41,146
they stole my chain, got into a van
and drove off.

595
00:54:42,104 --> 00:54:43,729
Does your mom know about this"

596
00:54:44,396 --> 00:54:46,187
If I tell her about this,
She is going to be even more worried.

597
00:54:46,854 --> 00:54:49,729
I am going to tell her that I was
injured during a game.

598
00:54:50,271 --> 00:54:52,979
As it is, she is in great pain
because of my brother's behaviour.

599
00:56:30,646 --> 00:56:32,479
Hey... why are you here"

600
00:56:32,479 --> 00:56:34,229
You are acting like a jerk.

601
00:56:34,771 --> 00:56:35,812
What did I do"

602
00:56:35,979 --> 00:56:37,896
Stop pretending to be innocent.

603
00:56:38,187 --> 00:56:40,979
Don't you think it's wrong
to keep avoiding me every day"

604
00:56:41,562 --> 00:56:42,562
Why are you here"

605
00:56:42,562 --> 00:56:45,521
I was passing this way
and I saw your stupid looking car.

606
00:56:45,812 --> 00:56:49,521
Not one single message or a call.
What's happening"

607
00:56:49,937 --> 00:56:53,396
Mounika, I am going through something.
I am in the process of resolving it.

608
00:56:53,396 --> 00:56:54,271
Is everything ok"

609
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:55,562
Yeah. Yeah.
All's good.

610
00:56:55,562 --> 00:56:58,729
Just a small emergency.
Once it's resolved, we shall meet. Okay"

611
00:56:58,729 --> 00:57:00,146
Alright, bye.

612
00:57:03,479 --> 00:57:04,812
Bye.
-Bye.

613
00:57:16,522 --> 00:57:16,939
Hello

614
00:57:16,939 --> 00:57:19,064
Madam"
I am calling from the cooperative bank.

615
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:22,189
There is a cheque for 40 lakhs
that's come for clearance to your account.

616
00:57:22,855 --> 00:57:24,147
40 lakhs"
-Yes.

617
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:24,939
No, sir.

618
00:57:25,314 --> 00:57:27,730
I gave a cheque for 5 lakhs only.
Please check it again.

619
00:57:27,730 --> 00:57:29,397
No, madam.
It's for 40 lakhs.

620
00:57:29,397 --> 00:57:31,980
Madam, due to insufficient funds,
I gave you a call.

621
00:57:32,272 --> 00:57:33,022
Is that so"

622
00:57:33,855 --> 00:57:35,272
I will get back to you.

623
00:57:35,272 --> 00:57:36,522
Alright, madam.

624
00:58:17,147 --> 00:58:17,689
Hello"

625
00:58:18,147 --> 00:58:20,147
Sir, I am calling from
Kompally central bank.

626
00:58:20,147 --> 00:58:23,480
Yeah. What is it" -The 40 lakhs cheque
that you have deposited has been rejected.

627
00:58:30,897 --> 00:58:31,897
Mani, your mom called.

628
00:58:31,922 --> 00:58:34,921
Apparently, you haven't been picking
up her calls for the past two days.

629
00:58:35,064 --> 00:58:36,064
Here, talk to her.

630
00:59:06,189 --> 00:59:09,522
Hello, lawyer Satyam speaking.
-Hello, it's Mani here.

631
00:59:15,230 --> 00:59:16,772
Who are you"
-Are you Lalitha Devi"

632
00:59:16,772 --> 00:59:17,397
Yes, I am.

633
00:59:17,814 --> 00:59:19,564
You have been served a legal notice.

634
00:59:19,976 --> 00:59:21,539
Who would do that to me"

635
00:59:21,564 --> 00:59:23,396
Your son has registered
a case against you

636
00:59:23,421 --> 00:59:25,338
because you have issued
a fraudulent cheque.

637
00:59:29,522 --> 00:59:30,522
Please sign here.

638
00:59:37,522 --> 00:59:38,064
Hello...

639
00:59:38,064 --> 00:59:39,481
Uncle" Mani has registered
a case against mom

640
00:59:39,506 --> 00:59:40,921
on the charge of issuing
a fraudulent cheque.

641
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:42,105
I'll be right there.

642
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:52,605
Mani!
This is what you resort to"

643
00:59:52,897 --> 00:59:54,605
Aren't you ashamed of
doing this to your mother"

644
00:59:54,689 --> 00:59:57,564
Money! Money! Money!
That is all you seem to care about.

645
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:01,480
Despite all your dirty tricks
I have tolerated you.

646
01:00:02,355 --> 01:00:04,329
You will forever remain
in history as the person

647
01:00:04,354 --> 01:00:05,980
who ruined your own
mother's reputation.

648
01:00:06,022 --> 01:00:07,855
I am ashamed to even look at you.

649
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:12,230
Ashamed"

650
01:00:12,855 --> 01:00:15,855
That woman just gave birth to me.
But once I was out in this world,

651
01:00:16,189 --> 01:00:18,939
she couldn't bear me any longer
and abandoned me.

652
01:00:22,355 --> 01:00:24,480
When I was young, people told me
that I lost my way.

653
01:00:25,522 --> 01:00:30,980
Everybody grew distant from me
Just as them, even my mother abandoned me.

654
01:00:33,855 --> 01:00:37,272
The mother who is supposed to
love and cherish me threw me away alone.

655
01:00:40,897 --> 01:00:42,939
I never had any emotional support.

656
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:50,355
I spent years inside those four walls.

657
01:00:50,397 --> 01:00:52,605
I was lonely and no one knew my pain
or my tears.

658
01:00:58,272 --> 01:01:01,730
Not one... Not a single person
came to support me.

659
01:01:05,355 --> 01:01:07,105
And that distance increased now.

660
01:01:11,772 --> 01:01:15,605
If you think what I'm doing is wrong
what she did to me is sin.

661
01:01:16,189 --> 01:01:17,314
Think about it.

662
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:24,147
Who would be etched in the history
as a cautionary tale" Her or me"

663
01:01:35,230 --> 01:01:36,147
Joseph...

664
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:37,772
And you are"
-Mani...

665
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:40,064
Follow me...

666
01:01:51,855 --> 01:01:52,772
Joseph...

667
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:00,939
What"
You are early. How"

668
01:02:07,064 --> 01:02:09,480
Joseph, I wanted to tell you something.

669
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:11,897
I owe your 30 lakhs.

670
01:02:13,105 --> 01:02:14,980
But I don't have a single penny on me.

671
01:02:17,814 --> 01:02:20,105
Beat me up or Kill me.
Do what you wish with me

672
01:02:21,272 --> 01:02:22,355
But there is one thing I must tell you.

673
01:02:23,105 --> 01:02:25,022
I am in the midst of a legal proceedings

674
01:02:25,814 --> 01:02:31,605
I will give you not just 30
but 35 lakhs in total. Give it a thought.

675
01:02:33,814 --> 01:02:37,272
This is the only way that I can pay you.

676
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:41,147
So, this is your option"

677
01:02:42,105 --> 01:02:42,689
Look into this.

678
01:02:43,564 --> 01:02:45,022
You gave a good stuff to media.

679
01:02:46,522 --> 01:02:49,314
The heartless son who dragged
his mother to the streets.

680
01:02:49,897 --> 01:02:50,772
Super Head line.

681
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:52,105
Mom, take a look at this.

682
01:02:52,605 --> 01:02:55,230
The lawsuit between you and Brother
is in the newspapers.

683
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:57,689
Why is he doing this"

684
01:03:05,439 --> 01:03:07,105
You have taken the fight
to streets just to survive.

685
01:03:10,022 --> 01:03:12,064
Mani... I want money.

686
01:03:12,355 --> 01:03:15,439
I don't care how you get it.
It's your problem.

687
01:03:16,105 --> 01:03:18,064
It's my money.
And I want it.

688
01:03:20,689 --> 01:03:24,772
Not 30... but 35 lakhs.
I'll keep waiting.

689
01:03:37,564 --> 01:03:41,147
A son has dragged his mother to the streets

690
01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:42,534
A young man identified
as DJ Mani Shankar

691
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:44,397
working in a club has registered
a case against his mother,

692
01:03:44,397 --> 01:03:47,855
Lalitha Devi on the charge of
issuing a fraudulent cheque.

693
01:03:47,855 --> 01:03:52,329
The celebrated and nationally-acclaimed
author Lalitha Devi

694
01:03:52,354 --> 01:03:54,963
has been insulted
in her own home.

695
01:03:55,189 --> 01:03:58,544
Let us wait and find out if it's either
the mother or that jerk of a son,

696
01:03:58,569 --> 01:03:59,838
who will win this law suit.

697
01:04:02,772 --> 01:04:06,314
This useless society that doesn't recognise
my past or my problem...

698
01:04:06,730 --> 01:04:09,397
has branded my actions as wrong doing.

699
01:04:09,939 --> 01:04:12,147
It doesn't matter who I am up against.
I must win.

700
01:04:12,439 --> 01:04:13,480
How.."

701
01:04:15,689 --> 01:04:17,105
My Brain is on an offer drive.

702
01:04:17,272 --> 01:04:18,730
and it has stopped functioning.

703
01:04:20,314 --> 01:04:24,564
To distance myself from these
thoughts, I need a companion.

704
01:04:32,605 --> 01:04:35,939
If I take this, no one can stop me.

705
01:05:17,314 --> 01:05:19,064
Mani! Crowd is waiting for you.

706
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:50,189
Buddy!
Surprise!

707
01:06:06,064 --> 01:06:07,230
I liked your girl.

708
01:06:09,689 --> 01:06:11,189
Cheers!

709
01:06:12,522 --> 01:06:13,855
This is for you.

710
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:23,689
Let's dance.

711
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:43,730
Come with me once.
-Where"

712
01:06:43,730 --> 01:06:44,939
Just come with me.
-Why"

713
01:06:44,939 --> 01:06:46,272
Just come with me. I'll tell you.

714
01:06:49,730 --> 01:06:51,355
Not that, Kaaki. Give me the room key.

715
01:06:51,772 --> 01:06:54,522
Oh my! You guys are already there"
All the best.

716
01:06:55,605 --> 01:06:56,064
Come.

717
01:07:14,064 --> 01:07:16,897
What are you doing"
What are you doing, Mani"

718
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:28,189
Stop it, Mani.

719
01:07:31,189 --> 01:07:34,397
Mani!
Do you even realise what you are doing"

720
01:07:40,730 --> 01:07:42,897
Are you on drugs"
Why are you behaving this way"

721
01:07:57,772 --> 01:07:59,480
Let's take a break for two minutes.

722
01:08:39,022 --> 01:08:42,189
Mounika, I am ready.

723
01:10:02,147 --> 01:10:03,689
Looks like he's lost his mind.

724
01:10:09,855 --> 01:10:12,980
Mounika...
Mounika, please wait for me.

725
01:10:17,064 --> 01:10:19,314
Mounika, stop.
Stop!

726
01:10:19,897 --> 01:10:20,855
Leave me.
Where are you going"

727
01:10:23,272 --> 01:10:24,939
You have filed a lawsuit against
your own mother"

728
01:10:24,939 --> 01:10:25,814
Disgusting!

729
01:10:26,022 --> 01:10:30,939
Love, relationships, emotions,
Do you even know the value of these things"

730
01:10:31,522 --> 01:10:34,730
I am an orphan and
I know their value.

731
01:10:36,355 --> 01:10:40,189
Please stop, Mounika.
Please.

732
01:10:41,355 --> 01:10:42,147
Auto!

733
01:11:13,564 --> 01:11:15,689
Who is this beggar"
Looks like our Mani.

734
01:11:16,022 --> 01:11:17,064
It is Mani.

735
01:11:17,230 --> 01:11:18,980
Oh my god!
His idiocy dragged him onto the road.

736
01:11:19,439 --> 01:11:21,439
Buddy, why do you look
like an ascetic that comes to a Kumb Mela"

737
01:11:21,605 --> 01:11:22,772
What happened to you"

738
01:11:23,689 --> 01:11:25,105
Did the girl leave you and go"

739
01:11:25,272 --> 01:11:28,689
I was abandoned then, by my mother
and now, I am abandoned by this girl.

740
01:11:29,939 --> 01:11:32,605
Why is everyone abandoning me"

741
01:11:33,730 --> 01:11:37,314
Let me be frank about it, buddy.
You are a difficult to deal with and a jerk

742
01:11:38,564 --> 01:11:39,355
Huh, really"

743
01:11:43,939 --> 01:11:45,272
He looks like Kali...

744
01:11:48,939 --> 01:11:50,314
Buddy, that's Kali.

745
01:11:50,772 --> 01:11:51,939
Who is Kali"

746
01:11:51,939 --> 01:11:53,980
He is that giraffe-looking fellow
who stole your pot in that game.

747
01:11:54,022 --> 01:11:56,210
If you want to solve the issue.
It's this guy you should be pursuing

748
01:11:56,235 --> 01:11:56,963
and not your mother.

749
01:12:06,980 --> 01:12:07,730
Just come quickly.

750
01:12:12,439 --> 01:12:15,314
Hey! Stop the car!

751
01:12:15,522 --> 01:12:16,272
Hey!

752
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:18,022
He is fast and furious.

753
01:12:18,689 --> 01:12:21,230
Why are they giving us the stinky eye"
Not us. You!

754
01:12:26,064 --> 01:12:28,147
I forgot why we are running.

755
01:12:28,772 --> 01:12:30,772
Buddy, his car is here.
Huh"

756
01:12:31,064 --> 01:12:33,855
This way.
There... come...

757
01:12:37,439 --> 01:12:40,772
This is the same number...
-We caught him.

758
01:12:40,855 --> 01:12:43,230
Where is he"
This is the car they used.

759
01:12:43,314 --> 01:12:44,272
Be careful, buddy.

760
01:12:44,272 --> 01:12:44,939
Kali.

761
01:12:44,939 --> 01:12:47,105
Do you know what's happening"
Remove those glasses.

762
01:12:47,105 --> 01:12:48,480
Kali fellow, where are you"

763
01:12:49,064 --> 01:12:50,147
These look like offices.

764
01:12:53,772 --> 01:12:55,105
He must be is in this building.

765
01:12:56,147 --> 01:12:59,397
Kali, I will catch you.
No one can stop me.

766
01:12:59,397 --> 01:13:01,230
If we follow them,
it's going to turn into a police mess.

767
01:13:01,314 --> 01:13:01,772
Police"

768
01:13:01,772 --> 01:13:03,439
Let's get away.
I am begging you.

769
01:13:03,689 --> 01:13:04,772
You are literally killing me!

770
01:13:10,147 --> 01:13:10,897
Let's rob the car"

771
01:13:20,397 --> 01:13:21,439
I got you, Kali.

772
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:23,105
And you pretend to be some sort of
Boxing heavyweight.

773
01:13:23,105 --> 01:13:24,772
Buddy, please stop it.

774
01:13:31,272 --> 01:13:34,647
Buddy, everybody's eyes are on us.
Buddy, please.

775
01:13:34,855 --> 01:13:36,314
Won't you change"
Please"

776
01:13:36,314 --> 01:13:37,189
No, I won't.

777
01:13:49,314 --> 01:13:51,897
You filed a law suit against your mother.
How disgusting!

778
01:13:52,939 --> 01:13:54,970
If you want to solve the issue.
It's this guy you should be pursuing

779
01:13:54,995 --> 01:13:55,671
and not your mother.

780
01:13:56,522 --> 01:13:59,999
Let us wait and find out if it's either
the mother or that jerk of a son,

781
01:14:00,024 --> 01:14:01,338
who will win this law suit.

782
01:14:30,255 --> 01:14:32,338
Kaaki! Kaaki!

783
01:14:32,797 --> 01:14:34,213
Kaaki fellow!

784
01:14:34,255 --> 01:14:34,838
What "

785
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:37,755
Take this number plate and find out
the details of the car immediately.

786
01:14:38,297 --> 01:14:40,713
I wonder what's going on in his head.
As soon as he woke up,he thought of Kali.

787
01:15:15,422 --> 01:15:23,630
" This is a silent song of the heart. "
" The emotion of love "

788
01:15:23,630 --> 01:15:31,380
" it searches for a destination " " but
the destination is beyond its reach. "

789
01:15:31,713 --> 01:15:39,713
" Yesterday's blessing is today's debt "
" Who knows what's in store for tomorrow" "

790
01:15:39,922 --> 01:15:47,297
" It isn't true to its name. "
" this is an incomparable confusion. "

791
01:15:48,255 --> 01:15:55,297
" My heart is festive when it's
filled with your memories. "

792
01:15:55,505 --> 01:16:03,213
" I am so lost in your
thoughts; I have no free time. "

793
01:16:35,797 --> 01:16:43,463
" My feet are drawn towards
you; matching your pace. "

794
01:16:43,463 --> 01:16:51,297
" I am in a hurry yet hesitant.
My heart leaps and runs "

795
01:16:51,297 --> 01:17:06,547
" You are my awakening "
" My suffering is solely because of you "

796
01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:12,005
" This is a silent song of the heart. "

797
01:17:12,130 --> 01:17:13,547
Mounika! Mounika!

798
01:17:13,797 --> 01:17:15,297
I need to speak to you once.

799
01:17:17,547 --> 01:17:19,380
Please.Please listen to me.
Please.

800
01:17:19,838 --> 01:17:23,172
" but the destination
is beyond its reach. "

801
01:17:23,797 --> 01:17:26,838
Mani, Mounika told me everything about you.

802
01:17:27,297 --> 01:17:29,213
The thing is she likes you a lot.

803
01:17:29,380 --> 01:17:32,005
Being an orphan,
She understands the value of parents.

804
01:17:32,255 --> 01:17:35,838
But you went and filed a law suit against
your mother. This upset her a lot.

805
01:17:36,088 --> 01:17:38,338
This week, she is taking charge as an SI.

806
01:17:38,338 --> 01:17:40,797
She is already under pressure and so,
she is unable to handle this right now.

807
01:17:40,922 --> 01:17:42,172
If you want to have Mounika in your life,

808
01:17:42,172 --> 01:17:45,005
You have to mend your ways
and withdraw the lawsuit.

809
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:57,422
Your mother has been served,
The trail will start in the coming week.

810
01:17:57,422 --> 01:18:01,380
All my colleagues were thoroughly shocked
when they heard about this lawsuit.

811
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:02,918
Just because you are
my childhood friend,

812
01:18:02,943 --> 01:18:04,737
I've agreed to give you
the charge of this case.

813
01:18:04,797 --> 01:18:08,005
Well, we have a very strong and clear case.

814
01:18:08,130 --> 01:18:10,338
And in case this doesn't work out,

815
01:18:10,338 --> 01:18:14,755
We will establish you as the legal heir
and crack the case from another angle.

816
01:18:15,797 --> 01:18:21,672
Anyways, where do you get this sort of
ideas" Who feeds you these unique ideas"

817
01:18:23,588 --> 01:18:25,630
Assistant!
-Sir"

818
01:18:25,630 --> 01:18:29,172
Remember, we took on a fraudulent
cheque case" Did we receive the payment"

819
01:18:29,297 --> 01:18:31,505
They paid us with a cheque
and that turned out to be fraudulent too.

820
01:18:32,380 --> 01:18:34,838
False cheque!
Same case.

821
01:18:38,422 --> 01:18:39,297
Tell me, Kaaki.

822
01:18:39,380 --> 01:18:40,713
We found the registered address
of that number plate.

823
01:18:40,713 --> 01:18:41,380
Where"

824
01:18:41,463 --> 01:18:42,884
Shamshabad, Gandhi
Nagar, Road number 2.

825
01:18:42,909 --> 01:18:44,571
It's near the post office
of our previous hood.

826
01:18:44,963 --> 01:18:45,922
Do you know what's interesting"

827
01:18:45,922 --> 01:18:48,338
The address registered to that number plate
belongs to our MLA Jeeva Reddy.

828
01:18:58,505 --> 01:19:00,130
Buddy, that's the MLA's house.

829
01:19:08,755 --> 01:19:10,547
And that's MLA Jeeva Reddy.

830
01:19:12,838 --> 01:19:14,838
Apparently, this Jeeva Reddy
has a mistress in the village.

831
01:19:14,922 --> 01:19:17,588
And the children born to that
mistress of his are Kali and Durga.

832
01:19:17,797 --> 01:19:20,047
This is Durga.
and he is Kali's big brother.

833
01:19:22,255 --> 01:19:24,505
Anyways, their mother passed away
due to cancer when they were quite young.

834
01:19:24,755 --> 01:19:26,838
And the talk is that they don't
get along well with Jeeva Reddy.

835
01:19:26,922 --> 01:19:29,005
And so, Kali doesn't ever come here
and he never meets up with Jeeva Reddy.

836
01:19:29,963 --> 01:19:31,547
But this Durga here is in another league.

837
01:19:31,672 --> 01:19:34,099
He puts on an act in front of
Jeeva Reddy and has gone on to

838
01:19:34,124 --> 01:19:35,237
become the party president.

839
01:19:35,338 --> 01:19:37,338
He is quite skilled at crushing people
using their weakness.

840
01:19:39,547 --> 01:19:42,797
But Durga loves his brother Kali a lot.
and it's rumoured that he

841
01:19:43,130 --> 01:19:44,713
would move heaven and earth for
his brother. Despite all that,

842
01:19:44,713 --> 01:19:46,297
Kali doesn't disclose his whereabouts
even to his brother. As far as I know,

843
01:19:48,297 --> 01:19:51,297
I don't think we would get any information
regarding Kali from here.

844
01:19:51,380 --> 01:19:52,130
Come on. Let's go.

845
01:19:52,213 --> 01:19:53,088
He is coming this way.
Look away. Look away.

846
01:19:53,547 --> 01:19:55,130
We should manage in a way
That doesn't arouse his suspicions.

847
01:19:55,172 --> 01:19:56,672
Oh dear!
He is coming this way.

848
01:19:56,713 --> 01:19:58,672
Don't fret.
Try to look casual.

849
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:04,088
I'll just tell him that we lost our way.
Why do you always drag me in"

850
01:20:04,088 --> 01:20:05,797
Just stop it guys,
I got dragged in unnecessarily.

851
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:07,588
Come out.

852
01:20:08,172 --> 01:20:09,505
Why do you keep getting me
stuck in every business"

853
01:20:12,213 --> 01:20:13,130
What are you looking at"

854
01:20:13,422 --> 01:20:14,922
Sir, I actually wanted
to ask you something.

855
01:20:14,947 --> 01:20:16,612
But I was really scared
and so I just sat inside.

856
01:20:16,797 --> 01:20:18,755
What is it"
-I hope you don't mind.

857
01:20:18,838 --> 01:20:19,630
Just ask.

858
01:20:19,630 --> 01:20:20,255
Promise"

859
01:20:20,672 --> 01:20:21,713
Never mind.

860
01:20:21,797 --> 01:20:24,005
Oh dear! Is he going to
blurt out about Kali"

861
01:20:24,088 --> 01:20:26,838
The thing is... our hero Balayya's movie
Legend was released yesterday, right"

862
01:20:26,838 --> 01:20:27,547
And it turned out to be a super hit

863
01:20:27,547 --> 01:20:28,630
So, there is way too much
crowd at the ticket booths.

864
01:20:28,630 --> 01:20:30,255
So, if possible, please provide us with
3 tickets for the matinee show.

865
01:20:30,255 --> 01:20:30,630
Please, sir.

866
01:20:31,005 --> 01:20:33,088
Fool!
What are you on about"

867
01:20:33,255 --> 01:20:34,380
Please, sir. Please.

868
01:20:34,380 --> 01:20:35,797
Apparently, there are no tickets
available for three more days.

869
01:20:35,797 --> 01:20:36,755
Get up!

870
01:20:36,755 --> 01:20:37,713
Please, sir.
Even the manager could not help us.

871
01:20:37,713 --> 01:20:39,463
Seems like he isn't right in the head.
Go!

872
01:20:39,755 --> 01:20:41,963
I just asked you for three tickets and
you act all haughty.

873
01:20:41,963 --> 01:20:43,213
But, we on the other hand have to
forever vote for you.

874
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:45,213
So, you voted"
-Yes, of course.

875
01:20:45,297 --> 01:20:45,963
Where"

876
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:47,088
Anakapalli.

877
01:20:47,255 --> 01:20:48,463
What place is this"
-Hyderabad.

878
01:20:48,547 --> 01:20:50,672
You voted elsewhere
and you demand favours here.

879
01:20:50,755 --> 01:20:51,755
Does it matter"

880
01:20:51,838 --> 01:20:52,672
Mad fellow!

881
01:20:53,380 --> 01:20:55,430
Someday, I am going to come back
here with the Balayya's fan club and

882
01:20:55,455 --> 01:20:56,362
then, I'll deal with you guys.

883
01:20:56,672 --> 01:20:58,406
The other day, one of our guys
made a request for a kidney.

884
01:20:58,431 --> 01:20:59,505
Looks like he might
be the right fit.

885
01:20:59,505 --> 01:21:00,588
Right.
Oh dear! Kidney"

886
01:21:00,713 --> 01:21:02,674
Stop showing off in front of me.
I know I am no match.

887
01:21:02,699 --> 01:21:03,922
How could you treat
us so lightly"

888
01:21:03,922 --> 01:21:05,630
We are all born from mother's womb.

889
01:21:09,713 --> 01:21:12,297
It's quite clear that
the cheque was forged.

890
01:21:12,713 --> 01:21:14,713
That can be proved quite
easily in the courts.

891
01:21:15,213 --> 01:21:17,713
His case against you
doesn't stand a chance.

892
01:21:17,797 --> 01:21:19,755
We are not that worried about the case.

893
01:21:20,338 --> 01:21:22,512
You need to register a
case against him with

894
01:21:22,537 --> 01:21:25,821
the penal code sections 420, 463,
467, 468 and some more if needed.

895
01:21:26,338 --> 01:21:29,713
Brother, Please think it over.
I will try and speak to him once.

896
01:21:29,797 --> 01:21:33,838
Why would you speak to him"
Your pampering is what turned him this way.

897
01:21:34,172 --> 01:21:35,630
He forged the cheque.

898
01:21:35,630 --> 01:21:37,380
And he is very assured that
You wouldn't take any action against him.

899
01:21:37,505 --> 01:21:39,713
Sambayya sir, please file the case.

900
01:21:39,838 --> 01:21:41,713
I don't think he would
mend his ways otherwise.

901
01:21:41,713 --> 01:21:45,130
Okay, sir. Leave that to me.
I will take care of it.

902
01:22:00,588 --> 01:22:02,547
Where can I find Mani"

903
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:04,755
Go straight,
the second room on the right.

904
01:22:27,297 --> 01:22:31,338
Mani, why are you so angry with me"

905
01:22:32,255 --> 01:22:34,630
Why have you resorted to such methods"

906
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:37,588
Why do you need that kind of money"

907
01:22:38,213 --> 01:22:41,005
Please listen to me. Leave this life behind
and come home to us.Let's go.

908
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:45,880
I only have you and Pallavi.

909
01:22:46,422 --> 01:22:48,172
Why are you distancing yourself from us"

910
01:22:48,963 --> 01:22:50,797
How will I have that kind of money"

911
01:22:51,588 --> 01:22:53,255
If I have to sell something,
It will be that house.

912
01:22:53,463 --> 01:22:56,005
That was the house your father lived in.

913
01:22:56,255 --> 01:22:59,588
It contains his memories.
How can I sell that"

914
01:23:00,172 --> 01:23:05,422
How are we support Pallavi
if we sell the one house that we have"

915
01:23:06,963 --> 01:23:09,172
As my son, won't you even
think about us"

916
01:23:22,588 --> 01:23:23,380
Mani...

917
01:24:01,422 --> 01:24:03,255
Oh no! What happened"

918
01:24:03,547 --> 01:24:04,588
Who do you think is responsible for this"

919
01:24:05,047 --> 01:24:07,213
Students' unions or Political parties"

920
01:24:07,547 --> 01:24:08,380
What all these"

921
01:24:30,922 --> 01:24:34,380
Mani Shankar!..Mani
Shankar!...Mani Shankar!

922
01:24:46,088 --> 01:24:49,505
Mani Shankar, you have filed a law suit
against your own mother.

923
01:24:49,797 --> 01:24:53,088
This case challenges our
basic human relations.

924
01:24:53,630 --> 01:24:57,588
Just so that you don't pursue this further
and give a wrong message to the society,

925
01:24:57,588 --> 01:25:01,713
would you consider dropping the case or do
you want to go forward with the law suit"

926
01:25:14,047 --> 01:25:15,088
Tell me, Mani shankar.

927
01:25:15,297 --> 01:25:18,547
do you want to go forward with the law
suit" Or do you want to drop the case"

928
01:25:21,463 --> 01:25:23,130
No sir, I want to pursue the law suit.

929
01:25:24,047 --> 01:25:26,606
People like this will not change.
I wonder what this is

930
01:25:26,631 --> 01:25:28,321
and what other
horrors are in store.

931
01:25:41,422 --> 01:25:42,547
Order! Order!

932
01:25:43,963 --> 01:25:49,838
Your honour, this person Mani Shankar
is trying hard to fool the court.

933
01:25:50,630 --> 01:25:56,005
Maybe, he is the very first person
to have filed a lawsuit against his mother.

934
01:25:57,005 --> 01:25:58,588
Coming to the point,

935
01:25:59,047 --> 01:26:03,422
There are certain facts about the case
that the court is unaware of.

936
01:26:03,422 --> 01:26:05,213
I wish to present these before
you, your honour.

937
01:26:05,547 --> 01:26:09,547
My client, Lalitha Devi, issued a cheque
to her son in the last month...

938
01:26:09,547 --> 01:26:12,755
i.e. on the 18th of March.

939
01:26:12,922 --> 01:26:14,213
The value of that cheque is....

940
01:26:14,297 --> 01:26:14,963
Sir,

941
01:26:15,588 --> 01:26:16,547
Lalitha.

942
01:26:16,547 --> 01:26:18,838
I would like to speak to you.
-You wait. Sit down.

943
01:26:19,047 --> 01:26:21,672
If there is anything you would like to say,
come into the stand and tell the court.

944
01:26:22,005 --> 01:26:22,922
Let me go, brother.

945
01:26:34,463 --> 01:26:39,380
Sir, No mother would ever make a mistake
when it comes to her son's life.

946
01:26:39,922 --> 01:26:45,172
And similarly, no son misunderstands
his mother.

947
01:26:47,088 --> 01:26:51,588
In one way, I am responsible
for the situation we are in right now.

948
01:26:51,838 --> 01:26:55,130
And I will take that responsibility.

949
01:26:57,005 --> 01:27:01,505
I will settle the entire amount
that I am supposed to give my son.

950
01:27:01,755 --> 01:27:03,963
Please give me some time.

951
01:27:12,713 --> 01:27:15,922
It's quite common for a family
to have misunderstandings

952
01:27:16,047 --> 01:27:18,797
but one should try and resolve
them in their own homes.

953
01:27:19,005 --> 01:27:21,380
But it is very unfortunate that your
private issues are being aired in public.

954
01:27:21,463 --> 01:27:24,255
No matter what the reasons,
observing the circumstances,

955
01:27:24,338 --> 01:27:27,255
the court has decided to award
Lalitha Devi a span of one month

956
01:27:27,380 --> 01:27:32,422
i.e. within 14th of October, to settle
the debts she owes to her son.

957
01:27:41,630 --> 01:27:42,880
Court is adjourned.

958
01:27:54,380 --> 01:27:55,713
What did you do"

959
01:27:56,172 --> 01:27:58,297
You are ready to beg on the streets

960
01:27:58,588 --> 01:28:00,755
but do not want him to
be exposed as a fraud.

961
01:28:02,213 --> 01:28:05,922
What kind of love is this"
This is what's ruining him further.

962
01:28:19,713 --> 01:28:21,422
Here. These are the
original documents of the house.

963
01:28:21,422 --> 01:28:24,338
I never thought you would ever be
in a situation such as this

964
01:28:24,505 --> 01:28:27,422
Deposit this cheque in the bank.
It would be cleared in two days.

965
01:28:27,588 --> 01:28:28,297
Alright, sir.

966
01:28:37,505 --> 01:28:38,672
Brother, tell him to come.

967
01:28:53,338 --> 01:28:53,963
Hi, uncle

968
01:28:54,047 --> 01:28:54,838
Sir,

969
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:03,005
Lalitha. He is here.

970
01:29:07,422 --> 01:29:08,338
You stay right there.

971
01:29:18,463 --> 01:29:19,463
Tell him to sign.

972
01:29:33,297 --> 01:29:34,547
Sign here, buddy.

973
01:29:35,255 --> 01:29:36,005
Take this pen.

974
01:29:44,172 --> 01:29:46,922
What a useless fellow!
We should get rid of all his things.

975
01:29:48,463 --> 01:29:49,422
What's this brother"

976
01:29:50,172 --> 01:29:51,005
What are you doing"

977
01:29:51,005 --> 01:29:52,172
Don't say a word.

978
01:29:52,297 --> 01:29:53,693
You are going to give that
fellow all your wealth

979
01:29:53,718 --> 01:29:54,838
and treat your daughter
unfairly, is it"

980
01:29:54,838 --> 01:29:55,505
No, brother. Please.

981
01:29:55,630 --> 01:29:57,338
Get rid of everything of his.

982
01:29:57,338 --> 01:29:58,963
Please listen to me, brother.
-It's already too late.

983
01:30:17,963 --> 01:30:18,880
Take this sir

984
01:30:20,255 --> 01:30:22,596
Tell him to never set foot
in this neighbourhood.

985
01:30:22,621 --> 01:30:24,422
If he does,
it will be the end of him.

986
01:30:24,422 --> 01:30:24,922
He will not set foot here sir.

987
01:30:24,922 --> 01:30:26,422
You can live in peace.
I shall take my leave.

988
01:30:42,588 --> 01:30:44,463
Scriptures have time and again stated

989
01:30:44,463 --> 01:30:46,338
with great clarity and proof that

990
01:30:46,338 --> 01:30:47,672
If a loving and caring mother

991
01:30:47,672 --> 01:30:50,088
is subjected to emotional
distress by someone,

992
01:30:50,088 --> 01:30:51,963
even if that person is as great as Raavana,

993
01:30:51,963 --> 01:30:53,963
he will ultimately die a pitiful death.

994
01:30:56,005 --> 01:30:57,463
Alright, fine. You can have noodles.

995
01:30:59,922 --> 01:31:00,880
Hey, Mani...

996
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:03,838
How come you are here"
What happened to you"

997
01:31:04,088 --> 01:31:07,838
Buddy, looks like you have changed your
style. Have you sold half your beard"

998
01:31:08,838 --> 01:31:09,672
He is my son.

999
01:31:09,922 --> 01:31:11,297
He is always interested in games.

1000
01:31:11,297 --> 01:31:13,380
Kushal, tell uncle a hi.
-Hi, uncle.

1001
01:31:13,713 --> 01:31:15,005
He is going to turn out like you.

1002
01:31:15,672 --> 01:31:18,755
You were the one who bet
even before the chicks hatched.

1003
01:31:18,922 --> 01:31:20,630
Ah! Those were the times.
It was quite interesting.

1004
01:31:22,505 --> 01:31:24,130
Get back to how you were.

1005
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:25,922
Can I tell you something else"

1006
01:31:25,922 --> 01:31:29,255
You don't have to go anywhere.
I am a bookie full-time.

1007
01:31:58,755 --> 01:32:01,547
With the drop of alcohol percentage
in my blood,

1008
01:32:01,838 --> 01:32:04,630
I seem to have some newfound strength.

1009
01:32:23,838 --> 01:32:26,130
Don't leave that guy!
Beat him to pulp. Hit him.

1010
01:32:26,130 --> 01:32:28,255
Hey, you.
You aren't from around here"

1011
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:29,672
Bihar, right"

1012
01:32:57,130 --> 01:32:59,338
Hey, Mani.
What's happening"

1013
01:33:00,005 --> 01:33:02,505
Why are they attacking you"
Who are these people"

1014
01:33:03,172 --> 01:33:04,547
Bitter memories of my past life.

1015
01:33:08,422 --> 01:33:12,172
I won.
I fought against this society and won.

1016
01:33:12,922 --> 01:33:20,380
I thought I solved my problems after I gave
Joseph the money but, my sins haunted me.

1017
01:33:21,047 --> 01:33:24,963
The actual problem began right after that.
My life took an unimaginable turn.

1018
01:33:34,838 --> 01:33:38,922
" The music of the masses is blaring "

1019
01:33:38,922 --> 01:33:42,297
" Bust out those raunchy moves. "

1020
01:33:45,963 --> 01:33:53,047
" Crank is up a little more "
" Let's not slow down or stop. "

1021
01:33:55,963 --> 01:34:00,213
" DJ spin the console "
" Put a spin on it, remix it "

1022
01:34:00,213 --> 01:34:03,588
" Let's dance the night away "

1023
01:34:03,588 --> 01:34:10,130
" Let's celebrate our youth "
" and let it fly high. "

1024
01:34:14,088 --> 01:34:17,588
" Come on rock the beat "

1025
01:34:17,588 --> 01:34:20,672
" Come on rock the beat "

1026
01:34:20,797 --> 01:34:24,255
" Come on rock the beat "

1027
01:34:24,380 --> 01:34:28,380
" Come on rock the beat "

1028
01:34:50,047 --> 01:34:54,047
" The life is fleeting; don't you think" "

1029
01:34:54,047 --> 01:34:57,547
" Make some friends and
ride the wave of life "

1030
01:34:57,547 --> 01:35:01,005
" Carve your own destiny, friends "

1031
01:35:01,088 --> 01:35:04,588
" These are crazy times, rocks the beat. "

1032
01:35:04,797 --> 01:35:08,380
" There is no guarantee for tomorrow "

1033
01:35:08,463 --> 01:35:11,713
" Cultivate a relationship with your life "

1034
01:35:11,797 --> 01:35:14,797
" Everyone makes mistakes "

1035
01:35:14,797 --> 01:35:17,088
" There are no mistakes,
just move forward courageously "

1036
01:35:17,088 --> 01:35:20,338
" Be your own cheerleader
and honour yourself "

1037
01:35:20,505 --> 01:35:23,838
" Come on rock the beat "

1038
01:35:23,838 --> 01:35:27,172
" Come on rock the beat "

1039
01:35:27,338 --> 01:35:30,672
" Come on rock the beat "

1040
01:35:30,755 --> 01:35:34,088
" Come on rock the beat "

1041
01:35:36,213 --> 01:35:38,880
Oh sorry! The dress is stained.

1042
01:35:39,755 --> 01:35:40,672
Sorry.

1043
01:35:49,818 --> 01:35:51,568
It doesn't seem like this would dry
anytime soon. Is yours done"

1044
01:35:53,943 --> 01:35:56,109
Two minutes.
The smell isn't gone yet.

1045
01:35:56,276 --> 01:35:58,609
If my father finds out that I've been out,
I am done for.

1046
01:35:58,693 --> 01:36:01,734
He is of the opinion that pubs are breeding
grounds for drug and alcohol addictions.

1047
01:36:18,693 --> 01:36:21,401
Are you done"
-I am done. I am coming.

1048
01:36:25,734 --> 01:36:26,651
Sorry.

1049
01:36:26,651 --> 01:36:29,901
If you are not going to let me sleep in
I would have adjusted here outside.

1050
01:36:29,901 --> 01:36:31,443
Don't you trust me even a bit"

1051
01:36:32,318 --> 01:36:36,401
It's not that I don't trust you. It's
just that I don't trust myself around you.

1052
01:36:36,401 --> 01:36:37,901
Is that so"
That's a very good joke.

1053
01:36:37,901 --> 01:36:40,318
Do you want me to tell you
something serious" -Hmm"

1054
01:36:41,234 --> 01:36:46,901
I must have already said this to you.
I like you a lot. Let's get married.

1055
01:36:47,693 --> 01:36:51,734
I like you a lot. If you like me too,
Let's get married.

1056
01:36:53,234 --> 01:36:57,818
Mani...Mani"
Why are you silent"

1057
01:37:14,151 --> 01:37:14,818
Move..

1058
01:37:23,943 --> 01:37:24,609
Move..

1059
01:37:26,318 --> 01:37:27,276
Hey...
-Sir"

1060
01:37:27,276 --> 01:37:28,068
What's going on"

1061
01:37:28,068 --> 01:37:29,693
There was a raid on
Z-rooms at Banjara Hills.

1062
01:37:29,693 --> 01:37:31,026
These are the people who have been
suspected of indulging in drugs.

1063
01:37:31,068 --> 01:37:32,901
This case is being dealt by the B shift.

1064
01:38:13,734 --> 01:38:16,234
What's your name"
-Poornima Naidu.

1065
01:38:20,526 --> 01:38:22,318
Mani.
-Tell me your full name.

1066
01:38:26,026 --> 01:38:26,984
Mani Shankar.

1067
01:38:28,068 --> 01:38:30,651
Why is there a drug packet in your pocket"

1068
01:38:31,318 --> 01:38:33,734
I found it in the toilet and
put it in my pocket.

1069
01:38:33,984 --> 01:38:36,151
It's only ‘cause the amount of drugs
found on you is very little,

1070
01:38:36,193 --> 01:38:39,109
we are being civil.
If not...

1071
01:38:39,401 --> 01:38:42,401
At that time, what were you guys doing"

1072
01:38:42,609 --> 01:38:45,526
My dress stained because of a spilled
drink. And so, I went in to wash it.

1073
01:38:45,526 --> 01:38:46,526
What room number is that"

1074
01:38:46,609 --> 01:38:48,776
Same room.
-Huh" What"

1075
01:38:49,568 --> 01:38:51,568
I mean Room 205.

1076
01:38:51,568 --> 01:38:53,901
Do you have the habit
of taking women into rooms"

1077
01:38:54,109 --> 01:38:56,568
The toilet in the club was in repair.
And so...

1078
01:38:56,568 --> 01:38:59,484
We checked their blood samples
There is no evidence of having taken drugs.

1079
01:38:59,901 --> 01:39:01,859
Do you have the habit of taking drugs"

1080
01:39:03,651 --> 01:39:04,693
I did, earlier.

1081
01:39:04,776 --> 01:39:06,109
Just answer the question.

1082
01:39:06,234 --> 01:39:07,943
Do you have the habit or not"

1083
01:39:08,401 --> 01:39:11,109
I used to. Not anymore. I quit.

1084
01:39:11,818 --> 01:39:12,984
Tell me the truth.

1085
01:39:14,151 --> 01:39:15,318
You want the truth"

1086
01:39:17,651 --> 01:39:19,984
After that day,
I never indulged in drugs.

1087
01:39:20,234 --> 01:39:22,443
I don't even remember what
I did that night.

1088
01:39:22,568 --> 01:39:27,859
I only told you truth.
It's just that you never believed me.

1089
01:39:28,318 --> 01:39:30,109
Even now, I am telling you the truth.

1090
01:39:30,318 --> 01:39:31,193
I love you.

1091
01:39:31,401 --> 01:39:33,026
Hey! What are you blabbering about"

1092
01:39:33,109 --> 01:39:34,068
Have you gone mad"

1093
01:39:34,151 --> 01:39:35,818
Poornima, please wait outside.

1094
01:39:36,359 --> 01:39:37,109
Okay..

1095
01:39:41,443 --> 01:39:43,068
Sir, could you give us some privacy.

1096
01:39:43,068 --> 01:39:44,776
Karthik...I will deal with this.

1097
01:39:46,068 --> 01:39:47,651
Mounika, ever since that day,
I have been trying to tell you.

1098
01:39:47,651 --> 01:39:49,568
Mani. Forget all that.

1099
01:39:49,734 --> 01:39:51,443
I am not interested in
your age-old explanations.

1100
01:39:51,568 --> 01:39:53,568
Karthik, take down his details
and send him away.

1101
01:39:53,693 --> 01:39:55,026
There is no need to file any case
against him.

1102
01:39:58,818 --> 01:39:59,734
Mounika!

1103
01:40:01,859 --> 01:40:04,526
You look awesome in police uniform.

1104
01:40:04,818 --> 01:40:05,609
Go on.

1105
01:40:08,651 --> 01:40:10,901
On you, it's looks about ok.
-Who asked you"

1106
01:40:25,359 --> 01:40:28,401
These people don't sleep
and don't let us sleep.

1107
01:40:29,068 --> 01:40:29,943
What's your name"

1108
01:40:30,068 --> 01:40:30,943
Mani Shankar.

1109
01:40:31,234 --> 01:40:32,109
Your father's name"

1110
01:40:33,401 --> 01:40:34,234
Amarnath.

1111
01:40:34,818 --> 01:40:35,984
Call him.

1112
01:40:37,151 --> 01:40:38,026
He is dead.

1113
01:40:39,734 --> 01:40:40,526
Your mother's name"

1114
01:40:42,943 --> 01:40:44,068
Mother's name"

1115
01:40:44,734 --> 01:40:47,859
She is not the mother to lift a finger even
when her son is in trouble. Never mind.

1116
01:40:47,984 --> 01:40:50,401
What are you on"

1117
01:40:50,443 --> 01:40:52,526
Your mom would be the one
to be ashamed to have you as her son.

1118
01:40:52,526 --> 01:40:55,568
Drugs, Alcohol, Girls.
Tell me a habit you don't have.

1119
01:40:55,818 --> 01:40:57,193
Tell me your mother's name first.

1120
01:41:00,776 --> 01:41:03,276
I am asking you.
What's your mother's name"

1121
01:41:04,984 --> 01:41:05,859
I don't want to say.

1122
01:41:05,943 --> 01:41:08,318
This isn't your house
to behave as you please.

1123
01:41:08,401 --> 01:41:09,359
This is a police station.

1124
01:41:09,359 --> 01:41:11,026
I am being polite.
Give me your mother's name.

1125
01:41:12,276 --> 01:41:13,193
No, I won't.

1126
01:41:13,276 --> 01:41:14,776
You.. Idiot!
Tell me.

1127
01:41:14,776 --> 01:41:15,693
I don't tell her name.

1128
01:41:15,734 --> 01:41:18,609
No, I don't.
I don't want to tell her name.

1129
01:41:18,609 --> 01:41:19,318
What will you do"

1130
01:41:20,234 --> 01:41:21,693
How arrogant you are!

1131
01:41:22,984 --> 01:41:24,901
Can't you tell your mother's name"

1132
01:41:24,901 --> 01:41:26,443
You!

1133
01:41:27,193 --> 01:41:28,484
You should be killed.

1134
01:41:28,526 --> 01:41:33,943
Are you that arrogant that you
Can't even take your mother's name"

1135
01:41:33,984 --> 01:41:35,484
How arrogant you are!

1136
01:41:35,484 --> 01:41:37,609
You think we are nobody to you.

1137
01:41:38,568 --> 01:41:39,859
I'll kill you.

1138
01:41:46,609 --> 01:41:48,526
What happened in that room"

1139
01:41:57,651 --> 01:41:58,526
Mom"

1140
01:42:00,484 --> 01:42:05,526
Apparently in a hotel raid,
the police caught Mani with a girl.

1141
01:42:05,818 --> 01:42:12,151
He had a packet of drugs on him and so,
uncle thrashed him in the police station.

1142
01:42:35,193 --> 01:42:37,359
I don't believe that you
are that affected by those beatings.

1143
01:42:37,526 --> 01:42:39,651
What exactly happened
between you and your uncle"

1144
01:42:44,901 --> 01:42:45,901
Hi....Pallavi

1145
01:42:46,234 --> 01:42:47,568
Pallavi is here.

1146
01:42:59,818 --> 01:43:00,651
How are you"

1147
01:43:01,859 --> 01:43:03,443
I heard what happened
in the police station.

1148
01:43:03,984 --> 01:43:06,776
Please don't get even more angry
at mom for what Uncle did to you.

1149
01:43:07,109 --> 01:43:10,859
Mom is very upset.
Could you please visit her at home once"

1150
01:43:12,901 --> 01:43:14,109
Brother, say something.

1151
01:43:16,318 --> 01:43:19,526
Don't you care about mom at all"
You don't want us around, is it"

1152
01:43:21,943 --> 01:43:24,151
Brother"..
stop...Brother

1153
01:43:38,734 --> 01:43:41,901
Mani. I have been trying to reach you.
Where are you"

1154
01:43:41,943 --> 01:43:43,318
What plans do you have tomorrow"

1155
01:43:43,318 --> 01:43:44,776
Tomorrow is Sunday, right"
There is a popup market.

1156
01:43:44,776 --> 01:43:46,026
I am going to get us a country chicken.

1157
01:43:46,109 --> 01:43:47,318
Useless fellow!

1158
01:43:47,693 --> 01:43:49,776
Mani, do you remember Surya from our hood"

1159
01:43:49,776 --> 01:43:53,901
He is organizing a huge pot in Sanath
Nagar. It's quite a bit prize, brother.

1160
01:43:53,984 --> 01:43:55,859
Just the other day, Mani
had a through thrashing from his uncle.

1161
01:43:55,943 --> 01:43:59,026
He's stopped doing this shit anymore.
Just leave, please.

1162
01:43:59,193 --> 01:44:01,901
Is that how it is"
The prize money is 30 lakhs.

1163
01:44:02,234 --> 01:44:05,901
I have another offer for you, Mani.
Kali is going to participate in the game.

1164
01:44:14,651 --> 01:44:16,068
Kali is going to participate in the game.

1165
01:44:49,943 --> 01:44:50,901
What should we do"

1166
01:44:51,068 --> 01:44:52,651
Mani is here.
It's quite risky.

1167
01:44:52,651 --> 01:44:54,026
Let's go.
Come on.

1168
01:44:54,984 --> 01:44:57,526
I will come directly to the point.

1169
01:44:57,609 --> 01:45:03,901
The game that we are going to play
involves 117 streets.

1170
01:45:04,359 --> 01:45:07,984
There is a car parked
in one of these streets.

1171
01:45:08,734 --> 01:45:13,026
There is a bag containing 30 lakhs
in the luggage compartment of the car.

1172
01:45:13,026 --> 01:45:17,068
Whoever finds that car and that bag
in a place such as this,

1173
01:45:17,151 --> 01:45:18,568
the money belongs to him.

1174
01:45:20,484 --> 01:45:23,151
I will give you a clue to finding that car.

1175
01:45:23,359 --> 01:45:28,484
When you add the last four digits
of that car number, it totals to seven.

1176
01:45:28,484 --> 01:45:30,276
The last number in that four digits is 2.

1177
01:45:30,359 --> 01:45:33,984
The key tone that you have will open
the luggage compartment of the car.

1178
01:45:35,109 --> 01:45:39,693
As soon as you get out of here, the game
commences when I give you the signal.

1179
01:45:40,151 --> 01:45:42,609
We are right now in the middle of the city.

1180
01:45:42,609 --> 01:45:46,154
Since it's broad daylight,
you would be playing this risky game

1181
01:45:46,179 --> 01:45:47,508
in the midst of people.

1182
01:45:47,609 --> 01:45:51,484
In case, you arouse
suspicion or the money does,

1183
01:45:51,484 --> 01:45:54,568
you might be caught by the
people or even the police.

1184
01:45:54,693 --> 01:45:57,318
No matter what happens,
we are not responsible

1185
01:45:57,359 --> 01:45:59,818
All that matters is whether you are here
and participated in the game and won it.

1186
01:45:59,818 --> 01:46:01,693
And finally leave without a trace.

1187
01:46:01,818 --> 01:46:03,734
This is the game.
All the best, guys.

1188
01:46:09,026 --> 01:46:12,818
What is this " -This is specially
for participants. Smear it.

1189
01:46:15,943 --> 01:46:18,484
Ah! You look good.

1190
01:46:32,734 --> 01:46:35,651
We should be the ones to find it.

1191
01:46:41,776 --> 01:46:42,359
Hey...

1192
01:48:09,484 --> 01:48:10,359
Hey! Stop!

1193
01:48:11,901 --> 01:48:12,568
Catch him!
Stop!

1194
01:48:12,818 --> 01:48:13,693
Hey! Stop!

1195
01:48:18,318 --> 01:48:19,276
Hey, stop!

1196
01:48:20,859 --> 01:48:22,276
Hey! Stop!

1197
01:48:24,526 --> 01:48:24,901
That way.

1198
01:48:31,276 --> 01:48:34,359
Respond! Respond! Something' fishy here.
We need back up immediately.

1199
01:48:39,901 --> 01:48:41,068
Leave me..

1200
01:48:43,943 --> 01:48:44,818
Hey! Stop!

1201
01:51:05,609 --> 01:51:09,234
I am not here just for money.
I am here for you.

1202
01:51:50,943 --> 01:51:52,401
Brother, I need a favour.

1203
01:51:54,234 --> 01:51:56,943
I need 5 lakhs urgently.

1204
01:51:56,943 --> 01:52:00,484
Huh" You seem to have more needs than
your station in life.

1205
01:52:00,776 --> 01:52:01,734
Cut it out.

1206
01:52:03,484 --> 01:52:05,859
You are so into girls.
You don't even realize the circumstances

1207
01:52:05,884 --> 01:52:06,675
of those around you.

1208
01:52:06,776 --> 01:52:09,234
All these years, I have worked myself
like a dog for you.

1209
01:52:09,651 --> 01:52:13,443
No matter how loyal you are.
A dog is still a dog.

1210
01:52:15,151 --> 01:52:19,318
Those 30 lakhs of yours were saved because
of a dog like me. Keep that in mind.

1211
01:52:19,984 --> 01:52:21,318
Get down!

1212
01:52:21,609 --> 01:52:23,109
Down, scum!

1213
01:52:23,276 --> 01:52:25,318
Go away.

1214
01:52:25,609 --> 01:52:27,109
Idiot... It seems he want lakhs.

1215
01:52:53,776 --> 01:52:55,329
Just as Alcohol, Cigarette

1216
01:52:55,354 --> 01:52:58,758
and Girls, obsession with an
enemy is an addiction too.

1217
01:53:00,151 --> 01:53:03,401
I am an addict to that kind of obsession.

1218
01:53:28,099 --> 01:53:30,057
Hello"
-Sir, there's been a murder here.

1219
01:53:30,057 --> 01:53:31,140
Murder" Where"

1220
01:53:37,974 --> 01:53:39,557
Inform the team that handles clues.
-Ok sir.

1221
01:53:39,557 --> 01:53:41,390
Send a message to DCP.
-Ok sir.

1222
01:54:06,849 --> 01:54:08,765
Hey... How did it happen"

1223
01:54:08,890 --> 01:54:10,307
Who was that"
- Don't know, Brother.

1224
01:54:15,474 --> 01:54:16,640
Whoever that was...

1225
01:54:18,599 --> 01:54:19,432
I won't let him go.

1226
01:54:21,890 --> 01:54:23,390
No, I am not letting it go.

1227
01:54:23,390 --> 01:54:27,307
There has been a murder on
the Lingampally Railway tracks.

1228
01:54:27,557 --> 01:54:30,182
The victim was identified to be
Kali Charan by the police.

1229
01:54:30,307 --> 01:54:34,474
It has been proven that the victim was
closely associated with MLA Jeeva Reddy.

1230
01:54:34,640 --> 01:54:38,850
The city administration has delegated
the investigation of this case to

1231
01:54:38,875 --> 01:54:41,914
Special investigation
Officer Sudhi Reddy Narayana.

1232
01:54:42,224 --> 01:54:44,288
This controversial officer
has heated up the debate.

1233
01:54:44,313 --> 01:54:45,807
Some laud his
efficiency and quickness

1234
01:54:45,807 --> 01:54:48,974
in resolving the case while others argue
that he has a history of using coercion

1235
01:54:48,974 --> 01:54:51,307
to extract confession.

1236
01:54:51,432 --> 01:54:56,588
Despite all this, Sudhi Reddy Narayana
has vowed to catch the suspect

1237
01:54:56,613 --> 01:54:58,748
in the case within 48 hours.

1238
01:55:03,390 --> 01:55:04,932
Get down your idiots

1239
01:55:05,057 --> 01:55:06,849
You guys just come in hordes, don't you"!

1240
01:55:06,974 --> 01:55:09,515
If you fall down from there,
Your lives will be ruined

1241
01:55:11,640 --> 01:55:13,140
You... useless fellow!

1242
01:55:14,474 --> 01:55:15,432
Who are you...."

1243
01:55:15,932 --> 01:55:17,599
What would happen if you jump the gate"

1244
01:55:18,390 --> 01:55:22,265
Apply these kinds of tactics to courting
women you might at least succeed.

1245
01:55:24,724 --> 01:55:27,432
Should I wear this myself!
Help me!

1246
01:55:29,682 --> 01:55:31,765
Bring all of his friends down here. I need
to know where all he's been and with whom.

1247
01:55:31,765 --> 01:55:32,890
I need all those details.

1248
01:55:32,890 --> 01:55:35,057
If needed, take the help of
our party workers.

1249
01:55:35,057 --> 01:55:36,474
I want every detail –

1250
01:55:43,265 --> 01:55:47,307
I am Sudhi Reddy Narayana.
Special Investigation Officer.

1251
01:55:48,724 --> 01:55:52,390
The commissioner has appointed
me to investigate Kali's murder case.

1252
01:55:52,390 --> 01:55:58,099
Officer, I am not able to process his
death. I need to know who killed him.

1253
01:55:59,140 --> 01:56:01,807
As far as I know,
he doesn't have enemies.

1254
01:56:01,807 --> 01:56:03,224
Can I have a quick look at the house"

1255
01:56:12,265 --> 01:56:18,640
I spoke to sir about you. He said he
would call you. You don't have to worry.

1256
01:56:21,682 --> 01:56:26,599
Bhanu... Are you Kali's close friend
or the one who murdered Kali"

1257
01:56:26,765 --> 01:56:28,890
Come on
Come. Come on.

1258
01:56:28,890 --> 01:56:31,390
Sir... What do you mean, sir"
-Me" Murdered Kali"

1259
01:56:31,390 --> 01:56:32,057
Let's go.

1260
01:56:32,057 --> 01:56:35,849
I don't know what's going on. I don't
know what happened. Tell me, please.

1261
01:56:35,932 --> 01:56:38,432
Move.
-Hey, officer!

1262
01:56:38,432 --> 01:56:39,015
Hey

1263
01:56:41,640 --> 01:56:46,099
I will be the one to decide
if you are a friend or a foe of Kali's.

1264
01:56:46,099 --> 01:56:47,432
Brother, please tell him.

1265
01:56:47,432 --> 01:56:49,432
I don't know anything, sir.
-What will your brother tell you"!

1266
01:56:49,432 --> 01:56:51,515
No matter who vouches for you,
I am not letting you off the hook.

1267
01:56:52,349 --> 01:56:53,724
Hey, you"
-Sir.

1268
01:56:53,849 --> 01:56:56,307
Our senior.
I mean Sudhi Reddy Narayana.

1269
01:56:56,390 --> 01:56:58,682
He has already taken charge of the case
and has begun arresting people.

1270
01:56:58,682 --> 01:57:00,515
He has asked us to surround all
the suspects and get them to him.

1271
01:57:00,515 --> 01:57:01,724
What's the state of affairs here"

1272
01:57:02,057 --> 01:57:05,349
We have already arrested three suspects
that are connected with Kali's past.

1273
01:57:06,224 --> 01:57:09,724
In the post mortem report, they have found
tiny coloured-particles on his dead body.

1274
01:57:09,974 --> 01:57:11,783
Upon investigation it
has been found that

1275
01:57:11,808 --> 01:57:13,831
Kali participated in
Sanath Nagar secret game.

1276
01:57:14,682 --> 01:57:15,757
It has been reported that Kali

1277
01:57:15,782 --> 01:57:18,015
and another person got into a
tussle on the account of money.

1278
01:57:18,015 --> 01:57:19,515
Our people have gone
to bring those guys in.

1279
01:57:20,057 --> 01:57:20,849
Who is that"

1280
01:57:31,557 --> 01:57:32,557
Are you Mani"

1281
01:57:32,765 --> 01:57:33,432
Yes. I am.

1282
01:57:33,557 --> 01:57:34,474
Get in the car.

1283
01:57:34,474 --> 01:57:35,724
Get your hands off me.
-Where are you taking me"

1284
01:57:35,724 --> 01:57:37,432
Get in the car.
Come on.

1285
01:57:47,974 --> 01:57:49,724
Here. Have some more.
-No, Mom. I am done. I don't want any more.

1286
01:57:49,724 --> 01:57:52,265
Just eat, silly girl.
How can you have just one"

1287
01:57:57,432 --> 01:57:58,140
Hello"

1288
01:57:58,224 --> 01:58:00,696
Lalitha, Our department's
crime branch has taken

1289
01:58:00,721 --> 01:58:02,789
Mani for interrogation
in a murder case.

1290
01:58:03,015 --> 01:58:04,015
Murder"

1291
01:58:06,307 --> 01:58:07,015
Mom"

1292
01:58:09,640 --> 01:58:10,849
What happened"

1293
01:58:12,474 --> 01:58:14,890
Your brother is being taken in
as a suspect in murder case.

1294
01:58:30,765 --> 01:58:32,099
Hey! Let's go.

1295
01:58:38,182 --> 01:58:39,349
What's happening inside"

1296
01:58:39,349 --> 01:58:41,682
It's regarding that close aid of MLA
Jeeva Reddy. Kali. His murder case.

1297
01:58:41,682 --> 01:58:42,932
They are interrogating
people regarding that case.

1298
01:58:43,057 --> 01:58:44,903
Shouldn't interrogations be
conducted in the station.

1299
01:58:44,928 --> 01:58:46,099
Why are they being
conducted here"

1300
01:58:46,140 --> 01:58:48,057
Who are we to remind Narayana sir
regarding the rules, madam"

1301
01:58:55,890 --> 01:58:58,474
Sir, as you know,
there are a total of 5 suspects.

1302
01:59:01,765 --> 01:59:06,099
These 5 suspects are either
directly or indirectly connected to Kali.

1303
01:59:06,224 --> 01:59:09,495
Apart from this,according
to their mobile signals,

1304
01:59:09,520 --> 01:59:11,956
they were within 5
kms of the murder.

1305
01:59:12,057 --> 01:59:14,390
So, one of them must surely
be the culprit.

1306
01:59:14,765 --> 01:59:16,224
You. Step out.

1307
01:59:19,390 --> 01:59:20,224
Shankar.

1308
01:59:22,140 --> 01:59:23,015
You as well.

1309
01:59:31,432 --> 01:59:34,390
Since this case is related to a person with
power, It comes with a lot of pressure.

1310
01:59:34,682 --> 01:59:37,557
Therefore, the higher authorities
allocate such cases to Narayana sir.

1311
01:59:39,390 --> 01:59:41,631
But, he targets one
of the suspects and

1312
01:59:41,656 --> 01:59:44,265
either through coercion,
harassment or threat,

1313
01:59:44,265 --> 01:59:46,932
he makes sure that he gets a confession
and claims to solve the case.

1314
01:59:47,140 --> 01:59:49,724
Come here. Come.
Stand here.

1315
01:59:50,015 --> 01:59:52,449
He was the one responsible for
mishandling that Bejawada rape case

1316
01:59:52,474 --> 01:59:53,998
with a falsely accused
person last month.

1317
01:59:57,515 --> 01:59:58,932
Raju"
-Sir"

1318
01:59:58,932 --> 02:00:00,640
Do you need special instructions"
-Carry on.

1319
02:00:00,724 --> 02:00:03,557
Sir, I don't know anything.

1320
02:00:03,974 --> 02:00:04,890
Is it you"
You"

1321
02:00:04,890 --> 02:00:06,724
Are you the murderer"
Tell me"

1322
02:00:06,807 --> 02:00:08,557
You"
Is that you"

1323
02:00:09,099 --> 02:00:11,057
Spit it out.
Tell me

1324
02:00:11,390 --> 02:00:12,140
Tell me.

1325
02:00:12,640 --> 02:00:15,599
What's with that innocent face"
Tell me.

1326
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:18,432
Sir, I am innocent.

1327
02:00:18,515 --> 02:00:19,849
Come here.
Come.

1328
02:00:19,849 --> 02:00:20,890
I don't know anything, sir.

1329
02:00:20,890 --> 02:00:23,307
Tell me.
Or else I will kill you. Tell me.

1330
02:00:23,307 --> 02:00:24,099
I don't know about him, sir.

1331
02:00:24,099 --> 02:00:26,349
Tell me.
Tell.

1332
02:00:29,140 --> 02:00:32,849
I have my doubts on Mani, sir.
I found every detail about him.

1333
02:00:33,432 --> 02:00:36,349
No matter the cost, he would go all the way.
He dragged his mother to the court.

1334
02:00:48,432 --> 02:00:50,432
Most recently, he was the one
who got into a fight with Kali.

1335
02:00:50,807 --> 02:00:51,849
Speak.

1336
02:01:05,682 --> 02:01:08,349
Raju...
Put him up on the table.

1337
02:01:33,682 --> 02:01:36,849
Hey, you.
Open your mouth and speak.

1338
02:01:36,932 --> 02:01:40,390
Your arrogance, pride and stubbornness
have no place here.

1339
02:01:42,557 --> 02:01:45,224
He should be alive
but break his arrogance.

1340
02:01:45,307 --> 02:01:48,724
I should not see any trace of that
arrogance, pride and stubbornness on him

1341
02:01:48,932 --> 02:01:51,015
even that moustache needs to go.

1342
02:02:24,682 --> 02:02:26,474
Sir has come
Stand up

1343
02:02:28,182 --> 02:02:29,432
You are a lucky one.

1344
02:02:29,432 --> 02:02:30,349
Go.. go home.

1345
02:02:30,474 --> 02:02:34,265
Mani has confessed.
He admitted to committing the murder.

1346
02:02:40,224 --> 02:02:42,565
Brother, the person who
murdered Kali is Mani.

1347
02:02:42,590 --> 02:02:44,581
Apparently,
he works as a DJ in a Pub..

1348
02:02:45,182 --> 02:02:47,682
Apparently, they always had issues
on account of money

1349
02:02:47,765 --> 02:02:50,057
He is going to appear in front of the judge
in two weeks.

1350
02:03:05,890 --> 02:03:07,765
Okay.
Proceed.

1351
02:03:08,182 --> 02:03:10,890
Your honour,
On the 26th of August,

1352
02:03:11,057 --> 02:03:15,099
this person Mani Shankar had brutally
murdered the victim named Kali.

1353
02:03:15,265 --> 02:03:19,807
Police investigation has established that
the motive for murder was primarily money.

1354
02:03:20,599 --> 02:03:23,571
Mani Shankar,
according to police investigation,

1355
02:03:23,596 --> 02:03:26,081
you have been accused
of murdering Kali.

1356
02:03:26,474 --> 02:03:27,265
Tell me.

1357
02:03:27,390 --> 02:03:29,765
Are you really the one who
committed this murder"

1358
02:03:32,599 --> 02:03:35,765
Tell me.
Are you the murderer or not"

1359
02:03:40,599 --> 02:03:41,890
I am the ....

1360
02:03:48,807 --> 02:03:50,265
one who murdered Kali.

1361
02:03:54,182 --> 02:03:56,057
I was in deep trouble.

1362
02:03:58,099 --> 02:03:59,724
And right at the time,

1363
02:04:00,057 --> 02:04:03,015
I was about to receive my money,
Kali tricked me and stole my money.

1364
02:04:03,557 --> 02:04:05,599
He was responsible for ruining my life.

1365
02:04:05,932 --> 02:04:11,349
One day,
I found Kali at Indra Ghat.

1366
02:04:12,140 --> 02:04:16,390
I was only angry at him but
had no intention of killing him.

1367
02:04:19,349 --> 02:04:28,432
He fought with me while ruining my life
I couldn't handle it anymore.

1368
02:04:30,807 --> 02:04:34,640
In a fit of anger, I grabbed a
rod around there and stabbed him.

1369
02:04:42,057 --> 02:04:47,724
I threw the rod away in the stream next
to the ghat so that I wouldn't get caught.

1370
02:04:53,515 --> 02:04:57,265
A person in anger,
is capable of doing all sorts of things.

1371
02:04:57,724 --> 02:05:01,849
For reasons related to money and
having been tricked of his money,

1372
02:05:01,849 --> 02:05:08,057
the accused (Mani)has admitted to murder of
Kali Charan.

1373
02:05:08,224 --> 02:05:12,803
However, the court believes that this
murder was committed in a fit of anger

1374
02:05:12,828 --> 02:05:14,789
rather than being pre-meditated.

1375
02:05:15,432 --> 02:05:21,470
According to IPC section 302,
the accused (Mani) is sentenced to

1376
02:05:21,495 --> 02:05:24,373
7 years rigorous imprisonment.

1377
02:05:27,015 --> 02:05:28,474
Court is adjourned.

1378
02:05:38,224 --> 02:05:40,807
Brother, he's got 7 years in jail.

1379
02:05:43,640 --> 02:05:45,807
Reddy, deal with the formalities.

1380
02:05:45,807 --> 02:05:46,349
Okay sir,

1381
02:05:46,974 --> 02:05:47,515
Let's go.

1382
02:05:47,724 --> 02:05:48,432
Brother.

1383
02:05:50,307 --> 02:05:54,932
Who the hell are you"
You dare murder my brother"

1384
02:05:55,640 --> 02:05:58,224
Just assume that the courts
have prolonged your life span by 7 years.

1385
02:05:58,224 --> 02:05:59,474
And that is your last.

1386
02:05:59,724 --> 02:06:01,182
Sir, please let him go.

1387
02:06:01,890 --> 02:06:04,640
Do you know who you're
laying your hands on" Get away.

1388
02:06:27,974 --> 02:06:33,307
He confessed that he murdered the guy.
At last, he resorted to murder as well.

1389
02:06:35,474 --> 02:06:39,140
Wait and watch.
My son is going to come back for me.

1390
02:07:13,557 --> 02:07:16,182
You must be wondering why I am here.

1391
02:07:16,265 --> 02:07:19,557
Yes, change does happen.
In people and in situations.

1392
02:07:20,890 --> 02:07:23,560
Never mind all that. Anyways,
how has your life been in these four weeks

1393
02:07:23,585 --> 02:07:24,498
inside these four walls"

1394
02:07:26,807 --> 02:07:29,265
You are not the Mani that
I knew during our relationship

1395
02:07:29,682 --> 02:07:33,182
I don't know what your reasons are
but there has been a lot of change in you.

1396
02:07:34,640 --> 02:07:38,015
Shall I tell you something"
I studied your case thoroughly.

1397
02:07:39,974 --> 02:07:43,932
I have seen how strongly you confessed
in the court that you are a murderer.

1398
02:07:43,932 --> 02:07:48,015
However, I have equal number evidences
to prove that you are not the murderer.

1399
02:07:48,099 --> 02:07:51,432
If I have your support,
I can prove that you are not the murderer.

1400
02:07:56,640 --> 02:07:59,907
According to my guess, there was
someone else already in that place

1401
02:07:59,932 --> 02:08:01,373
before the murder took place.

1402
02:08:01,557 --> 02:08:03,015
Who is that person"

1403
02:08:04,557 --> 02:08:05,557
Tell me.

1404
02:08:13,265 --> 02:08:14,432
Who is that third person"

1405
02:08:16,390 --> 02:08:17,349
Mani, wait.

1406
02:08:18,807 --> 02:08:20,224
You did not commit this murder.

1407
02:08:25,057 --> 02:08:26,599
Not only your police uniform...

1408
02:08:27,099 --> 02:08:30,057
even your brain at this job is awesome.

1409
02:08:32,474 --> 02:08:33,432
Mani, stop.

1410
02:08:34,307 --> 02:08:37,224
What are you hiding"
Please confess who is that person"

1411
02:08:38,140 --> 02:08:41,599
Mani, tell me.
What's that dark secret"

1412
02:08:55,974 --> 02:08:58,015
Hey, Mani,
The Jailor is here.

1413
02:09:05,640 --> 02:09:08,849
Are you counting your days
in this darkness"

1414
02:09:08,890 --> 02:09:09,974
I have news for you.

1415
02:09:10,057 --> 02:09:12,724
On account of good behaviour,
We are releasing you in two days.

1416
02:09:13,057 --> 02:09:15,682
We have the orders.
Congratulations.

1417
02:09:25,083 --> 02:09:25,833
Mani...

1418
02:09:26,750 --> 02:09:28,542
I am very happy that
you are being released.

1419
02:09:29,125 --> 02:09:30,125
But...

1420
02:09:30,250 --> 02:09:31,042
What is it"

1421
02:09:33,833 --> 02:09:34,917
I have some bad news.

1422
02:09:35,583 --> 02:09:39,125
Because you've killed Kali, His
brother's been waiting for your release.

1423
02:09:39,292 --> 02:09:43,500
Apparently, he has vowed to kill you within
24 hours of your release from the prison.

1424
02:09:44,333 --> 02:09:46,292
Mani is being released tomorrow.

1425
02:09:47,083 --> 02:09:49,833
I need to know his every
move after his release.

1426
02:09:51,542 --> 02:09:52,958
He can no longer be alive.

1427
02:10:32,500 --> 02:10:34,167
Mani... You must be happy"!

1428
02:10:52,542 --> 02:10:55,458
Brother, our informant called
We can start now.

1429
02:10:56,375 --> 02:10:58,708
The actual judgement for Kali's
death will be passed today.

1430
02:11:15,250 --> 02:11:19,542
Mani...
I know that you are here somewhere.

1431
02:11:19,792 --> 02:11:22,208
I will be the one passing the
sentence for my brother's death.

1432
02:11:22,208 --> 02:11:23,500
Come on out.

1433
02:11:29,125 --> 02:11:30,000
Search that side

1434
02:11:31,500 --> 02:11:32,208
Search that way.

1435
02:11:39,583 --> 02:11:42,958
run and catch him

1436
02:14:16,917 --> 02:14:19,292
Even though Mani served his sentence,

1437
02:14:19,375 --> 02:14:21,833
and the numerous years that have passed,
he didn't divulge the secret.

1438
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:23,542
But one thing is sure.

1439
02:14:23,667 --> 02:14:25,333
He is not the murderer.

1440
02:14:25,417 --> 02:14:27,083
He isn't"
-Yes. he isn't.

1441
02:14:27,250 --> 02:14:30,500
I am unable to figure out
for whom he had taken the blame.

1442
02:14:32,042 --> 02:14:34,042
On that day when Kali was murdered,

1443
02:14:34,042 --> 02:14:36,750
I am certain that there was someone else
present during the murder.

1444
02:14:51,167 --> 02:14:52,875
You won't ever think of mom, is it"

1445
02:14:54,417 --> 02:14:55,958
You don't need us anymore, is that it"

1446
02:14:59,583 --> 02:15:02,750
You won't ever think of mom, is it"
You don't need us anymore, is that it"

1447
02:15:03,792 --> 02:15:06,583
Brother, can we talk"
Please sit down.

1448
02:15:09,917 --> 02:15:12,708
I have been wanting to tell you something.

1449
02:15:14,250 --> 02:15:17,958
There is a gang that keeps creating trouble
in the nights at our academy.

1450
02:15:18,083 --> 02:15:20,208
There is a guy who has been harassing me.

1451
02:15:20,250 --> 02:15:24,167
He is tall and built up like a giant.
His name is Kali Charan.

1452
02:15:27,375 --> 02:15:29,933
One day, when I was returning
home from the academy,

1453
02:15:29,958 --> 02:15:32,274
he pulled me into the
car and tried to rape me.

1454
02:15:32,542 --> 02:15:36,792
But suddenly, a police patrol came by
and so, I was able to escape.

1455
02:15:38,500 --> 02:15:41,350
I wanted to tell this to Mom but I was
afraid that she would worry and so,

1456
02:15:41,375 --> 02:15:43,274
I told her that it was a
case of chain snatching.

1457
02:15:43,333 --> 02:15:44,375
What happened"

1458
02:15:44,375 --> 02:15:47,583
Even before I realised it,
someone snatched my chain.

1459
02:15:48,875 --> 02:15:52,000
He called me and harassed me.
He asked me to sleep with him.

1460
02:15:52,125 --> 02:15:54,833
Disgusting fellow!
Don't call me ever again.

1461
02:15:54,958 --> 02:15:58,375
I wanted to tell Uncle or complain
to the police But he threatened me -

1462
02:15:58,458 --> 02:16:03,417
If I disclosed this issue or even
reported this he said he would kill mom.

1463
02:16:04,250 --> 02:16:06,667
Don't involve my mother in this, please.

1464
02:16:06,750 --> 02:16:09,667
Just shut it and do what is asked of you.

1465
02:16:09,750 --> 02:16:12,875
I've been completely disturbed
and in hell because

1466
02:16:12,958 --> 02:16:15,792
I constantly lived in the fear of
being attacked by him.

1467
02:16:15,917 --> 02:16:17,167
I am very scared.

1468
02:16:21,083 --> 02:16:23,000
Kali would be participating in the game.

1469
02:16:24,542 --> 02:16:28,167
I am not here just for the money.
I am here for you.

1470
02:16:33,792 --> 02:16:38,708
Brother, Kali attacked me.

1471
02:16:46,250 --> 02:16:47,000
Let me go.

1472
02:16:47,583 --> 02:16:49,875
and tried to drag and rape me

1473
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:53,125
I didn't know what to do. I accidentally
grabbed a rod beside me And stabbed him.

1474
02:17:14,500 --> 02:17:18,917
Hello"
Brother... Kali...kali is dead.

1475
02:18:03,917 --> 02:18:06,631
Do you think the reason
why he admitted to a murder

1476
02:18:06,656 --> 02:18:08,899
that he didn't commit
is because of money"

1477
02:18:09,167 --> 02:18:11,833
That cannot be the case.
What will he do with the money in jail"

1478
02:18:12,167 --> 02:18:15,542
The Mani that we know, filed a law suit
against his own mother for money.

1479
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,417
Even if we assume that he sacrificed
himself for someone else, it is doubtful

1480
02:18:18,417 --> 02:18:20,958
because his character doesn't
support that assumption.

1481
02:18:21,125 --> 02:18:23,625
Mani's personality has undergone
a definite change for sure.

1482
02:18:23,708 --> 02:18:24,686
Kaaki told me that ever since

1483
02:18:24,711 --> 02:18:26,542
Mani was thrashed by his
Uncle in the police station,

1484
02:18:26,542 --> 02:18:29,167
there has been
a huge change in his behaviour.

1485
02:18:29,542 --> 02:18:31,993
As far as I know, he is not the
one to have undergone a change

1486
02:18:32,018 --> 02:18:33,107
on account of being beaten.

1487
02:18:33,167 --> 02:18:35,792
Something happened in those walls.

1488
02:18:38,542 --> 02:18:40,167
You think you have no one and that
you abandoned us"

1489
02:18:40,167 --> 02:18:40,917
I don't have anyone.

1490
02:18:41,042 --> 02:18:43,083
I tolerate all your shenanigans.

1491
02:18:43,083 --> 02:18:45,583
Even when you kicked your motherin her
heart, I could only watch and not react.

1492
02:18:46,042 --> 02:18:47,750
Since it's come this far.

1493
02:18:49,875 --> 02:18:51,708
You say you have no one, right"

1494
02:18:52,875 --> 02:18:53,958
That is true.

1495
02:18:54,917 --> 02:18:57,042
You weren't born to your mother.

1496
02:18:59,833 --> 02:19:02,500
We don't even know who
your birth mother is.

1497
02:19:02,958 --> 02:19:06,125
One day, you were found abandoned
on the outskirts of the village.

1498
02:19:06,458 --> 02:19:08,167
The dogs were trying to eat you up.

1499
02:19:08,250 --> 02:19:11,125
But then your parents rescued you
and raised you.

1500
02:19:13,042 --> 02:19:17,417
We don't know what caste or
what whore you came out of!

1501
02:19:17,417 --> 02:19:19,167
Your mother never ever gave that a thought.

1502
02:19:19,958 --> 02:19:21,833
Despite the numerous insults and troubles

1503
02:19:22,667 --> 02:19:25,250
that she was subjected to, on account
of you, she never said a word to anyone.

1504
02:19:25,833 --> 02:19:26,875
She never would either.

1505
02:19:27,042 --> 02:19:29,208
This is the truth.
This is the actual truth.

1506
02:19:32,167 --> 02:19:35,542
Your mother wrote the book ‘Sisuvu'
and that infant is you.

1507
02:19:36,042 --> 02:19:38,542
The village in the book are your parents.

1508
02:19:39,708 --> 02:19:42,458
Do you know the hopes and dreams
She had for you"

1509
02:19:42,750 --> 02:19:45,000
She made you an administrative officer
in that book.

1510
02:19:45,667 --> 02:19:48,792
You dragged her to the streets
and became a beast.

1511
02:19:49,375 --> 02:19:50,458
became a beast.

1512
02:19:54,042 --> 02:19:58,708
She loved you and nursed you. But you
poisoned her love and are killing her.

1513
02:20:27,708 --> 02:20:29,125
Listen to me carefully.

1514
02:20:29,125 --> 02:20:31,250
Do not tell anyone about this.

1515
02:20:31,333 --> 02:20:32,833
Especially mom.
Don't tell her anything.

1516
02:20:33,083 --> 02:20:34,375
Take this bag of money.

1517
02:20:35,042 --> 02:20:37,667
Clear off the debt on our house

1518
02:20:38,250 --> 02:20:40,667
Don't tell anyone that I gave
you this money and try to manage.

1519
02:20:41,958 --> 02:20:44,875
Mom anyways has an opinion about me.

1520
02:20:47,417 --> 02:20:49,458
She thinks that I will never change.

1521
02:20:50,917 --> 02:20:53,917
But in your case, you shouldn't ever
try to disappoint her or upset her.

1522
02:20:54,083 --> 02:20:54,875
Promise me"

1523
02:20:59,292 --> 02:21:00,250
Brother..

1524
02:21:07,708 --> 02:21:08,333
Go on.

1525
02:21:14,042 --> 02:21:15,042
Pallavi.

1526
02:21:16,875 --> 02:21:17,958
Take care of mom.

1527
02:21:56,125 --> 02:21:57,042
Brother...

1528
02:21:58,583 --> 02:22:00,208
Mom...

1529
02:22:00,542 --> 02:22:01,542
Come here once.

1530
02:22:01,542 --> 02:22:02,542
Who is it"

1531
02:23:35,042 --> 02:23:36,208
What happened"

1532
02:26:07,625 --> 02:26:09,292
Life is indeed very strange.

1533
02:26:09,792 --> 02:26:12,708
My mom hid the fact that
I was not her actual son.

1534
02:26:13,333 --> 02:26:16,500
And I hid the fact that I
have done all this for her.

1535
02:26:17,042 --> 02:26:19,833
Maybe these secrets will
forever be buried inside us.

1536
02:26:21,958 --> 02:26:25,333
I don't think I have paid the debt I owe
to my mother just by serving my sentence.

1537
02:26:25,875 --> 02:26:27,958
There never was a son born who
paid the debt he owed his mother.

1538
02:26:28,333 --> 02:26:29,292
And there never will be.

1539
02:26:29,750 --> 02:26:32,250
I have seen my mother as
an enemy since childhood.

1540
02:26:32,458 --> 02:26:35,792
Mom tried to get closer to me and
I tried as hard as her toget away.

1541
02:26:36,292 --> 02:26:39,375
I want to stay with my mom.
But it's not possible now.

1542
02:26:40,083 --> 02:26:43,327
Because of the lawsuit I filed against
her, Durga thinks that Mom

1543
02:26:43,352 --> 02:26:44,482
and I don't get along.

1544
02:26:45,333 --> 02:26:47,779
If I go back to mom,
there is a real danger that

1545
02:26:47,804 --> 02:26:50,149
Durga's anger will be
directed towards mother.

1546
02:26:51,042 --> 02:26:53,333
In the past,
I was addicted to drugs and gambling.

1547
02:26:53,750 --> 02:26:57,000
The only addiction I have as of
now, is my mother.

1548
02:26:57,417 --> 02:27:00,278
From this moment on,no matter
where I am or however far I am,

1549
02:27:00,303 --> 02:27:01,732
I will be there for my family.

1550
02:27:02,250 --> 02:27:05,875
No matter what they go through,
I will support them.

1551
02:27:06,792 --> 02:27:09,125
Till now, I twirl my moustache to win.

1552
02:27:09,792 --> 02:27:13,083
But now, I will use them for the good.
