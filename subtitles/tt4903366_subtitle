1
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:02,592
Wait for me, if you
are not too scared.

2
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:04,467
I know that's why you are
running away from me.

3
00:03:04,936 --> 00:03:06,019
Constantly changing places.

4
00:03:08,092 --> 00:03:09,759
Wait for me, if you
are not too scared.

5
00:03:10,509 --> 00:03:12,092
I know that's why you are
running away from me.

6
00:03:12,384 --> 00:03:14,092
Constantly changing places.

7
00:03:14,301 --> 00:03:15,676
Hey! How was your scene?

8
00:03:16,092 --> 00:03:17,301
Wonderful response.

9
00:03:17,426 --> 00:03:19,467
- Lot of applause.
- Good.

10
00:03:19,676 --> 00:03:23,138
Study your dialogues properly. They have
come for us and we must not disappoint them.

11
00:03:23,163 --> 00:03:26,217
Arun. It's your scene next.
Come fast.

12
00:03:30,467 --> 00:03:31,467
I am tired.

13
00:03:32,467 --> 00:03:35,301
My love! You look like
you are about to faint.

14
00:03:36,384 --> 00:03:38,175
From wandering these menacing woods

15
00:03:41,581 --> 00:03:44,245
Didn't you get any other
place to take me out?

16
00:03:44,842 --> 00:03:47,842
There are lot of new
malls in Chennai.

17
00:03:48,009 --> 00:03:52,259
It would be crowded there, so I brought
you here. But these people are awful!

18
00:03:52,384 --> 00:03:53,718
I hate looking at his face now.

19
00:03:55,876 --> 00:03:57,209
It's been two years since
you've finished college.

20
00:03:57,842 --> 00:04:01,426
Aren't you ashamed to ask me for money?

21
00:04:03,092 --> 00:04:04,092
Is it? Just a moment.

22
00:04:04,592 --> 00:04:05,883
What are you studying?

23
00:04:06,467 --> 00:04:09,384
- I've completed my studies.
- Completed?

24
00:04:10,477 --> 00:04:12,893
- Then what are you doing at present?
- Designing.

25
00:04:13,646 --> 00:04:14,230
Meaning?

26
00:04:14,551 --> 00:04:18,842
Fashion. Designing costumes
and styling for actors.

27
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:21,815
Oh! Tailoring is it? You
could've told me like that.

28
00:04:22,092 --> 00:04:24,759
If we study the Vedas, we
go to work at the temple.

29
00:04:25,217 --> 00:04:27,342
If we study in a college,
we go to work at a bank.

30
00:04:27,883 --> 00:04:32,259
Who will give you a girl if you roam
around with your theater and rehearsals?

31
00:04:32,701 --> 00:04:35,868
You are not bothered about yourself.
Think of your younger brothers.

32
00:04:36,853 --> 00:04:37,853
Nithya

33
00:04:38,634 --> 00:04:40,342
It's been two months since
you've paid the hostel fee.

34
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:43,259
Pay it up fast as it is difficult
to manage this anymore.

35
00:04:44,342 --> 00:04:45,925
Long live our leader!

36
00:04:46,347 --> 00:04:47,842
Long live tomorrow's
Chief Minister.

37
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:50,426
- Day after tomorrow's Prime Minister!
- Cut Cut

38
00:04:50,634 --> 00:04:52,718
- Shot OK.
- Please come back soon after the tea break.

39
00:04:54,384 --> 00:04:55,384
Do it with an emotion!

40
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,634
Show some feelings, only then
will they make you stand in front.

41
00:04:58,925 --> 00:05:02,384
I was supposed to act in Thillu Mullu. I
didn't agree to shave my mustache and I lost that chance.

42
00:05:02,718 --> 00:05:04,800
In Vaazhve Maayam, they
wanted me to grow a beard.

43
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,925
I didn't agree to it either.
Lost that chance too!

44
00:05:07,217 --> 00:05:09,759
Is this a proverb
to recite everyday?

45
00:05:10,842 --> 00:05:12,967
I am telling you so that
you do not become like me!

46
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:15,649
You should live the character.

47
00:05:15,883 --> 00:05:18,217
I am the hero in my theater play. If
any of my audience see me here...

48
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:20,925
Your play doesn't have an
audience, forget yours!

49
00:05:25,217 --> 00:05:29,634
He might have told you that, but when he
told me he said he would continue in the US

50
00:05:33,227 --> 00:05:34,227
Brother.

51
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,718
Dad's friends and mom's colleagues
have come for the birthday party

52
00:05:41,634 --> 00:05:43,551
Why don't you too join us?

53
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:11,134
These days, no one watches theater plays
even if we offer them free tickets!

54
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:13,654
We cannot be running it as a service.

55
00:06:13,764 --> 00:06:15,440
We have to do something.

56
00:06:15,686 --> 00:06:16,686
Sandhya!

57
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:19,009
Sandhya!

58
00:06:28,301 --> 00:06:31,551
Sandhya, I know that you'll be here.

59
00:06:31,676 --> 00:06:34,301
- Then prove that!
- How?

60
00:06:34,488 --> 00:06:35,488
By having coffee with me.

61
00:06:35,842 --> 00:06:37,426
This will not work out for me. Understood?

62
00:06:37,592 --> 00:06:38,883
I am ashamed to ask money at home.

63
00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:43,558
This is all what we know. How can we do
another profession when this is our passion?

64
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:46,426
What if we make our passion
as our profession?

65
00:06:50,092 --> 00:06:51,092
How many times do I have to tell you?

66
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,193
Why are you stalking me?

67
00:06:53,426 --> 00:06:56,050
First you will want to be a friend,
and then you'll say that you love me!

68
00:06:56,134 --> 00:06:58,759
Sandhya! You know
that I like you.

69
00:06:58,842 --> 00:07:02,384
Can you please stop it? When you say
all this I am starting to hate myself.

70
00:07:02,634 --> 00:07:04,050
Don't say so.

71
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,009
It's OK that you look average.

72
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,800
Is it hot?

73
00:07:12,592 --> 00:07:14,467
You will be finished
if you stalk me.

74
00:07:14,842 --> 00:07:16,967
I don't want to see your face.

75
00:07:19,967 --> 00:07:22,384
How clever of her to
not pay the bills.

76
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:28,384
Something that happens in cinema,
is wrong in real life...

77
00:07:30,384 --> 00:07:31,384
Why is that?

78
00:07:31,634 --> 00:07:34,134
Because everything is
rehearsed in cinema.

79
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:36,554
What if we apply the same in other's life?

80
00:07:39,522 --> 00:07:40,522
Life is real.

81
00:07:41,412 --> 00:07:45,134
It's overambitious to rehearse
and change something in life.

82
00:07:51,979 --> 00:07:53,896
- Are you in love with that girl?
- Truly...

83
00:07:55,217 --> 00:07:56,217
Madly...

84
00:07:57,089 --> 00:07:58,089
Deeply...

85
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:00,509
- Who is that girl?
- She is from my locality.

86
00:08:01,342 --> 00:08:05,426
I have been following her for two years
and have tried a lot to express my love.

87
00:08:07,217 --> 00:08:11,050
Nothing happened. It's OK.
My fate.

88
00:08:14,842 --> 00:08:15,925
What if she comes and
proposes to you?

89
00:08:21,342 --> 00:08:22,342
Can I do that?

90
00:08:22,883 --> 00:08:23,883
You can do it brother!

91
00:08:26,042 --> 00:08:29,167
Looks like all his fees will
be utilised on all these!

92
00:08:30,003 --> 00:08:32,211
Opposite poles attract.

93
00:08:34,376 --> 00:08:35,667
We should actually be
putting him in the laundry!

94
00:08:42,467 --> 00:08:46,301
The world is a stage. We
all act in our lives.

95
00:08:48,467 --> 00:08:50,759
But we do not know the climax.

96
00:08:52,467 --> 00:08:54,050
If we need the climax of our wish,

97
00:08:55,071 --> 00:08:57,404
then we need to change
the screenplay a bit.

98
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:01,342
Sandhya will come to the coffee shop
at Mylapore tomorrow evening at 5.00

99
00:09:01,967 --> 00:09:04,634
That's where Operation Venky starts!

100
00:09:05,676 --> 00:09:10,175
- We have hired the coffee shop and junior artists only till 7 PM. When will she come?
- When have women been on time?

101
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:12,967
You said shooting and that I
am doing a waiter's role...

102
00:09:13,592 --> 00:09:14,592
I can't find the cameras.

103
00:09:15,301 --> 00:09:18,509
It's not like olden times.
We use new technology.

104
00:09:18,634 --> 00:09:21,551
There are cameras fixed to pens.

105
00:09:23,676 --> 00:09:24,676
Sandhya is coming.

106
00:09:28,084 --> 00:09:28,775
Move.

107
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,759
Go now!

108
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:43,315
Fan

109
00:09:45,774 --> 00:09:46,232
Music

110
00:09:46,948 --> 00:09:55,282
Why did you crumble my heart into pieces

111
00:09:55,307 --> 00:09:57,182
- I am sorry.
- It's OK.

112
00:09:57,892 --> 00:10:06,642
I will give you
another one to break!

113
00:10:07,138 --> 00:10:09,150
This cafe is good isn't it?
We should come here often.

114
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:10,967
What else would
you like to have?

115
00:10:11,384 --> 00:10:13,676
Wow. Such a handsome guy.

116
00:10:14,175 --> 00:10:16,175
Yes. He looks like Hrithik Roshan!

117
00:10:16,925 --> 00:10:19,134
We should get settled if
we get a guy like him.

118
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,175
Madam, What do you like to have?

119
00:10:25,551 --> 00:10:27,050
Madam, What do you like to have?

120
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,800
One coffee please.

121
00:10:30,514 --> 00:10:31,514
Art Department!

122
00:10:32,308 --> 00:10:33,308
Tell him.

123
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:35,634
Are you nuts? Why do you
shout out Art Department?

124
00:10:35,967 --> 00:10:39,009
In Cinema, it is the Art Department that
takes care of these. What do you know?

125
00:10:40,967 --> 00:10:41,967
She will now look at you.

126
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:45,839
Turn slowly.

127
00:10:56,259 --> 00:10:57,259
- Your coffee mam.
- Thank you.

128
00:10:57,384 --> 00:10:58,384
She will now look at you again.

129
00:11:00,301 --> 00:11:03,217
It's very difficult to get
handsome guys these days.

130
00:11:03,342 --> 00:11:07,842
- The family also must like.
- It's enough if I like him, I am not bothered about family.

131
00:11:10,444 --> 00:11:11,861
She is going out. Go now.

132
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:17,279
Rain.

133
00:11:28,925 --> 00:11:32,134
Rain comes when there is a storm.

134
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:38,076
By saying storm, I meant you!

135
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:43,001
Shall we?

136
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:52,927
Thanks.

137
00:11:52,952 --> 00:11:54,328
- When is the next time?
- What?

138
00:11:54,592 --> 00:11:56,426
Rain... Storm...

139
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,251
This was the number she gave.

140
00:12:03,718 --> 00:12:04,718
It's ringing.

141
00:12:05,676 --> 00:12:07,384
Hello! Who is it?

142
00:12:07,883 --> 00:12:10,592
- It's me Venky.
- Venky?

143
00:12:11,134 --> 00:12:17,676
- Who? Coffee shop... Rain... Storm...

144
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:21,592
- I thought you would call me last night itself.
- You expected my call last night?

145
00:12:24,504 --> 00:12:25,920
I didn't call so that I
will come to your thoughts.

146
00:12:27,756 --> 00:12:28,339
Super!

147
00:12:28,636 --> 00:12:31,219
- Super Super
- You!!!

148
00:12:31,592 --> 00:12:33,384
- Tell me. What else?
- Then....

149
00:12:35,676 --> 00:12:37,175
Will you be coming to
the coffee shop today?

150
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:44,551
- No
- Bye!

151
00:12:48,104 --> 00:12:52,104
She will not be coming to the coffee shop,
instead she is going to the beach at 4.00pm

152
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,128
I think we can't meet her.

153
00:12:55,681 --> 00:12:56,681
You moron!

154
00:12:56,925 --> 00:12:59,759
She has hinted you to
meet her at the beach.

155
00:12:59,883 --> 00:13:01,442
Oh is that what she said!!!

156
00:13:01,467 --> 00:13:05,718
It's a big setup. We need a lot of actors.
It will be expensive.

157
00:13:06,107 --> 00:13:08,024
We have already
spent what he had paid.

158
00:13:08,134 --> 00:13:09,718
How are we going to
manage the expenses?

159
00:13:12,342 --> 00:13:13,551
Are you going to pawn your bike?

160
00:13:13,974 --> 00:13:15,766
It's a loan. Please repay it.

161
00:13:16,009 --> 00:13:19,676
- I never expected that you would come here.
- Hey beautiful!

162
00:13:24,789 --> 00:13:27,915
- Don't worry. Leave them.
- Hey dude! You are very lucky.

163
00:13:29,384 --> 00:13:30,883
You have managed to
get an awesome girl!

164
00:13:32,175 --> 00:13:33,175
She doesn't look like one!

165
00:13:39,134 --> 00:13:40,592
There he is! Showing off!

166
00:13:41,509 --> 00:13:44,426
Oh! Hero is it?

167
00:13:54,009 --> 00:13:56,009
You wastrel. Move aside.

168
00:14:06,567 --> 00:14:08,775
Are you an action hero?

169
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,676
Are you showing off before your girlfriend?
Come and fight if you dare.

170
00:14:13,967 --> 00:14:14,967
Come on!

171
00:14:18,985 --> 00:14:19,985
Come on!

172
00:14:20,467 --> 00:14:21,467
Come on!

173
00:14:28,508 --> 00:14:31,549
I am going to thrash your face.

174
00:14:46,551 --> 00:14:49,634
The director himself is acting as the dupe!
Is it a budget movie?

175
00:15:11,592 --> 00:15:12,592
Send more.

176
00:15:14,045 --> 00:15:15,420
Come on here boys.

177
00:15:15,613 --> 00:15:19,696
- Come on.
- Junior artists come over.

178
00:15:21,631 --> 00:15:23,173
Form a line...

179
00:15:26,983 --> 00:15:27,983
Come on now.

180
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:31,513
Fall down.

181
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:33,759
You go next.

182
00:15:39,092 --> 00:15:40,092
Fall back.

183
00:15:40,134 --> 00:15:43,301
- Some one else come on!
- I just went.

184
00:15:53,592 --> 00:15:57,009
What a man? Won't he ever grow old?

185
00:15:57,034 --> 00:15:58,034
Wonderful!

186
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:01,925
Wow! He looks like a super hero.

187
00:16:02,718 --> 00:16:03,718
He is great.

188
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:13,217
We have tried all means using Venky's fees and the loan...

189
00:16:13,718 --> 00:16:14,925
She doesn't budge to anything!

190
00:16:15,384 --> 00:16:18,759
We need to do black magic for
her to fall for his face!

191
00:16:19,735 --> 00:16:20,735
We'll do that too.

192
00:16:25,578 --> 00:16:26,745
- Hey!
- Hi

193
00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:31,342
- What are you doing here?
- Just to join you for jogging.
- For me!

194
00:16:32,009 --> 00:16:33,759
So sweet of you.

195
00:16:36,175 --> 00:16:37,175
Sandhya!

196
00:16:39,301 --> 00:16:40,301
Sandhya, how are you?

197
00:16:41,384 --> 00:16:43,175
Just a moment.

198
00:16:43,467 --> 00:16:45,426
Have you forgotten me?

199
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,630
- It's me Priya.
- Priya?

200
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,093
Hey! What is this?

201
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,720
- Hi. I am so sorry, that I forgot you!
- It's OK.

202
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:58,342
- How are you?
- I am good.
- Let's jog and chat.

203
00:16:58,467 --> 00:17:00,676
Sure sure! Come.

204
00:17:04,551 --> 00:17:08,217
- Venky! Where has he gone?
- She'll call you now.

205
00:17:08,883 --> 00:17:12,259
- Pick it up!
- Hey where are you?

206
00:17:13,175 --> 00:17:14,842
I am at home.

207
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,018
What? At home?

208
00:17:17,217 --> 00:17:19,883
- What happened?
- Hey Venky, its mom here.

209
00:17:21,592 --> 00:17:26,134
- Mom is calling me. I'll call you later.
- Bye.

210
00:17:28,426 --> 00:17:31,925
Dude! She is getting confused.

211
00:17:44,638 --> 00:17:46,734
- Hi!
- Hey! What are you doing here?

212
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:47,759
Come outside.

213
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:55,759
Venky.

214
00:18:03,092 --> 00:18:04,092
He was here.

215
00:18:18,037 --> 00:18:19,551
OK. Bye.

216
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:33,930
Have you come here too?

217
00:18:34,592 --> 00:18:37,009
I have been filled with your
thoughts wherever I am!

218
00:18:39,276 --> 00:18:41,693
Am I in love with you?

219
00:18:42,249 --> 00:18:45,790
- May be.
- It's not may be. I think I am in love with you.

220
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,800
Me too Sandhya!

221
00:18:54,504 --> 00:18:57,087
Yes Sandhya. I love you.

222
00:18:59,146 --> 00:19:01,438
Operation Venky is a success!!!

223
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:35,947
Watch out for the car!

224
00:19:38,743 --> 00:19:41,520
Hear me out, dude

225
00:19:41,879 --> 00:19:44,796
No tension, no BP

226
00:19:44,837 --> 00:19:47,045
Life is just a passing cloud

227
00:19:47,962 --> 00:19:50,253
Just take it easy

228
00:19:51,338 --> 00:19:55,838
You smile for those whatsapp selfie poses

229
00:19:57,422 --> 00:20:02,630
You like those Facebook smiley faces

230
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:06,185
Why do you get jitters when it comes to real life

231
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:08,805
Why do you show faces

232
00:20:09,497 --> 00:20:14,114
Don't build up your tensions
All the world's a stage

233
00:20:14,139 --> 00:20:15,931
That's a good name
for the company.

234
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:19,765
- You've given just one contact number - We'll
be in trouble if we provide full details.

235
00:20:20,537 --> 00:20:21,995
Where should we function from?

236
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:25,145
You always settle my payments,
irrespective of your condition.

237
00:20:25,312 --> 00:20:27,520
That's why I'm getting
you this place.

238
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:30,895
We load or unload items
at times, during shoot..

239
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,420
Else the set will be free. You
can use whenever you want.

240
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:42,270
- Where are you going this early?
- Office dad.

241
00:20:42,312 --> 00:20:44,687
- Where?
- UMT

242
00:20:45,437 --> 00:20:46,770
Sister concern of HMT.

243
00:20:46,895 --> 00:20:49,478
- What's the work at UMT?
- Seems they handle matches.

244
00:20:49,895 --> 00:20:52,270
- Is that UTV?
- Something similar, it's UMT.

245
00:20:52,353 --> 00:20:56,437
UMT will never back false love.

246
00:20:56,895 --> 00:21:01,478
Details of operations in UMT should remain
confidential within our team of six.

247
00:21:01,734 --> 00:21:04,150
Oh god, we've received
7377 applications.

248
00:21:05,298 --> 00:21:10,257
That doesn't matter. It's about
finding how many are truly in love.

249
00:21:10,562 --> 00:21:12,270
We'll end up with just two then.

250
00:21:13,062 --> 00:21:17,270
Sonia, she is a model who does ads.
People will come thronging to love her.

251
00:21:17,365 --> 00:21:19,699
How will we know that
you're truly in love?

252
00:21:20,187 --> 00:21:21,478
I'm one in the crowd..

253
00:21:22,145 --> 00:21:23,770
..but I'm the one for her!

254
00:21:28,853 --> 00:21:33,853
If your friends feel
worthless about you

255
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:39,718
If girl friends say
goodbye to you

256
00:21:41,173 --> 00:21:43,382
Keep those hard feelings aside

257
00:21:43,988 --> 00:21:49,238
Life is like an onion
You cry for nothing

258
00:21:49,996 --> 00:21:53,621
Get me a tea

259
00:21:56,035 --> 00:21:58,827
Hear me out, dude

260
00:21:59,196 --> 00:22:01,967
No tension, no BP

261
00:22:02,228 --> 00:22:04,728
Life is just a passing cloud

262
00:22:05,207 --> 00:22:07,707
Just take it easy

263
00:22:25,335 --> 00:22:26,335
Excuse me..

264
00:22:33,564 --> 00:22:34,564
You're in my home?

265
00:22:35,488 --> 00:22:38,196
I can't believe! I'm
overwhelmingly happy.

266
00:22:38,601 --> 00:22:41,309
- You like me that much?
- Can't limit my love mam.

267
00:22:42,113 --> 00:22:43,113
I'm so touched.

268
00:22:46,132 --> 00:22:47,132
Operation success!

269
00:22:51,273 --> 00:22:55,148
I'm so happy to get my daughter
married to such a lovely family.

270
00:23:05,324 --> 00:23:07,824
Megha is working in an IT
company near Akil's home.

271
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,937
She hasn't seen him before.

272
00:23:10,257 --> 00:23:12,632
He has never proposed
his love to her.

273
00:23:13,484 --> 00:23:14,859
But it's too late now.

274
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,944
Her dad has looked for an alliance for Megha
and they are visiting her place tomorrow.

275
00:23:19,676 --> 00:23:21,843
The guy is of rich background.
They may finalize this.

276
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:24,770
Stop.

277
00:23:25,246 --> 00:23:26,246
License please.

278
00:23:27,859 --> 00:23:29,525
Insurance? Get down
from the vehicle first.

279
00:23:30,014 --> 00:23:32,430
You need to obey our words.

280
00:23:38,956 --> 00:23:40,498
We like your daughter so much.

281
00:23:41,062 --> 00:23:43,853
- We too..
- Don't say that you like me too!

282
00:23:44,851 --> 00:23:48,059
I didn't know I'll come to
see such a beautiful girl.

283
00:23:48,555 --> 00:23:55,055
A slim and fair guy would perfectly match
her. Her life will also be blissful.

284
00:23:55,621 --> 00:23:57,954
You're so rich. You can
do whatever you want..

285
00:23:58,109 --> 00:24:00,025
Nope, our son's decision is..

286
00:24:00,207 --> 00:24:04,415
- Hello, who's it?
- Rajaram here. I got caught in trap!

287
00:24:05,087 --> 00:24:06,796
Don't get tensed.
We'll be there.

288
00:24:07,937 --> 00:24:08,520
Who are you people?

289
00:24:08,785 --> 00:24:12,993
Get up. You seem to have
come to the wrong address

290
00:24:14,312 --> 00:24:15,312
Just a minute.

291
00:24:17,145 --> 00:24:18,103
I..

292
00:24:18,978 --> 00:24:19,853
..like you.

293
00:24:23,688 --> 00:24:26,522
God is the Director

294
00:24:26,728 --> 00:24:28,895
We are all actors

295
00:24:29,812 --> 00:24:32,312
Days shall pass

296
00:24:32,812 --> 00:24:35,395
Why do you let
your heart tremble

297
00:24:36,053 --> 00:24:38,636
Have fun everyday

298
00:24:39,071 --> 00:24:41,280
Cherish the beauty around

299
00:24:42,035 --> 00:24:48,827
There is nothing much to do
around Everyday is a holiday

300
00:24:51,131 --> 00:24:53,916
Hear me out, dude

301
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:56,259
No tension, no BP

302
00:24:57,238 --> 00:24:59,993
Life is just a passing cloud

303
00:25:00,273 --> 00:25:02,648
Just take it easy

304
00:25:03,492 --> 00:25:04,492
UMT will take care.

305
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:17,119
Hello..

306
00:25:31,937 --> 00:25:34,603
Mr. Santhosh Reddy, MD,
Green Valley Homes.

307
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,632
Your flats are too good.

308
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:41,978
You build excellent apartments,
but can't you build love?

309
00:25:42,187 --> 00:25:43,978
I can fix a business
deal in a single meet..

310
00:25:44,603 --> 00:25:48,603
But roaming around girls
or talking to them..

311
00:25:49,437 --> 00:25:50,478
..not my cup of tea.

312
00:25:50,937 --> 00:25:54,520
Why should you go behind her?
Let's make the vice-versa happen.

313
00:25:55,812 --> 00:25:57,853
You need to spend a
lot, is that okay?

314
00:25:58,145 --> 00:26:00,437
I don't mind about the
number of crores.

315
00:26:01,524 --> 00:26:02,274
Crore?

316
00:26:02,441 --> 00:26:03,191
What's her name?

317
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:04,359
Maya.

318
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:12,145
- Got her photo?
- I don't have photo.

319
00:26:13,554 --> 00:26:19,203
But.. This is the Ad made for
our company, Green Valley.

320
00:26:19,228 --> 00:26:22,520
Wow, mam is looking gorgeous.
Awesome pair.

321
00:26:22,853 --> 00:26:23,853
Can you give the advance?
We shall start.

322
00:26:24,145 --> 00:26:25,353
Not her.

323
00:26:28,129 --> 00:26:29,129
Is that her?

324
00:26:30,678 --> 00:26:31,678
Is that him then?

325
00:26:33,381 --> 00:26:34,381
Which girl?

326
00:26:36,145 --> 00:26:37,145
The singer of this song!

327
00:26:39,043 --> 00:26:40,043
She is magical.

328
00:26:40,499 --> 00:26:45,207
Her voice, her
beauty, her smile!

329
00:26:47,845 --> 00:26:48,845
Maya!

330
00:26:49,812 --> 00:26:50,812
I want her in my life.

331
00:26:51,395 --> 00:26:54,187
Of course, don't worry.
We're there to help.

332
00:26:56,062 --> 00:26:57,770
We'll discuss and tell you.

333
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:01,392
We'll call you back. Thanks.

334
00:27:04,074 --> 00:27:05,074
We'll surely call you.

335
00:27:07,687 --> 00:27:10,270
We maintain the policy not to
finalize a project immediately.

336
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:13,035
Have you gone mad?

337
00:27:13,562 --> 00:27:17,728
Such a huge project from such a rich man. He is ready
to pay any amount. You said you'll call later.

338
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:22,262
For rich men like him, love
is just for time pass.

339
00:27:23,978 --> 00:27:25,895
How can we take it up without
knowing if he is truly in love?

340
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:27,853
No, he is ready to
pay any amount.

341
00:27:28,687 --> 00:27:31,562
We're doing this for our
survival, not money.

342
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:35,353
Yes, not for money, stupid! We
shall get as an apartment instead.

343
00:27:40,087 --> 00:27:46,421
I never liked you, I never
loved you, understand?

344
00:28:27,775 --> 00:28:28,775
Arun is entering now.

345
00:28:30,504 --> 00:28:32,754
Captain of St. Mary's college.

346
00:28:33,874 --> 00:28:34,874
3 balls 12 to win.

347
00:29:01,392 --> 00:29:02,392
Come here.

348
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:29,798
Was that no ball?

349
00:29:30,353 --> 00:29:32,145
And it's not a no ball.

350
00:29:32,478 --> 00:29:35,478
Arun, are you okay?

351
00:29:36,187 --> 00:29:37,978
And 8 runs.

352
00:29:38,728 --> 00:29:41,437
Disappointed, and now
it's going to be..

353
00:30:35,129 --> 00:30:36,145
Oh god!

354
00:30:52,853 --> 00:30:54,428
They're always like this.

355
00:30:57,562 --> 00:31:00,728
They'll create troubles if they
are at the verge of losing.

356
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:15,874
Reading Thirukural just once would not
suffice. Read it twice or thrice.

357
00:31:16,228 --> 00:31:17,228
Arun..

358
00:31:19,024 --> 00:31:22,233
- Had dinner outside - No
mom, not feeling hungry.

359
00:31:23,478 --> 00:31:24,978
Why dear? Aren't
you feeling well?

360
00:31:27,228 --> 00:31:30,145
- What wound is this?
- Got hit by a ball while playing cricket.

361
00:31:33,626 --> 00:31:34,626
Sit down.

362
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:39,228
What were you doing without
even visiting a doctor?

363
00:31:39,562 --> 00:31:41,603
- Just a small wound mom
- Is this small?

364
00:31:42,978 --> 00:31:44,353
Oops, is it paining?

365
00:31:44,728 --> 00:31:48,770
You're bearing so much pain in life.
This is nothing before those.

366
00:31:55,395 --> 00:31:56,395
Arun..

367
00:31:56,921 --> 00:31:57,921
You go..

368
00:31:59,437 --> 00:32:01,437
Oh, that's fine.

369
00:32:02,478 --> 00:32:04,312
- Hi Arun.
- Hi.

370
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,895
- Need to talk to you.
- What's it?

371
00:32:10,532 --> 00:32:14,157
I've been eying on you for the past
one year, since I joined college.

372
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:18,770
I try talking to you often.

373
00:32:19,275 --> 00:32:21,942
I got bold only today.

374
00:32:22,847 --> 00:32:24,639
I think..

375
00:32:25,186 --> 00:32:26,352
I think I love you.

376
00:32:38,071 --> 00:32:39,071
What beautiful eyes?

377
00:32:41,173 --> 00:32:42,173
Pretty smile..

378
00:32:44,491 --> 00:32:45,491
Beautiful hair..

379
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:48,567
Wait and see..

380
00:32:49,199 --> 00:32:50,741
You will get a
smart guy in life.

381
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:55,405
Arun, but I really..

382
00:32:56,048 --> 00:33:01,465
I don't believe love at first
sight, or love without seeing.

383
00:33:04,038 --> 00:33:05,211
It's just an infatuation.

384
00:33:07,418 --> 00:33:12,418
True love is what we get after
understanding each other's plus and minus.

385
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:19,508
So will you be fine if we mingle
and you get to know me well?

386
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:21,770
All the best.

387
00:33:24,453 --> 00:33:26,995
What is this? Is
that for Nandhini?

388
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:30,603
She is of total waste. I've
been behind her for one year.

389
00:33:31,038 --> 00:33:33,413
- She is aged.
- Who is this for?

390
00:33:33,853 --> 00:33:35,520
It's freshers day today!

391
00:33:36,353 --> 00:33:39,812
Hello everyone. My name is Mahadev.
I live in Cochin.

392
00:33:39,895 --> 00:33:42,187
I will definitely get a
girlfriend from any of these.

393
00:33:45,103 --> 00:33:46,812
Boys are to be seated here.

394
00:33:50,305 --> 00:33:52,305
Did any beautiful
girls come so far?

395
00:33:53,228 --> 00:33:54,228
No one!

396
00:34:04,796 --> 00:34:08,587
Among the first year, we have
one second year student.

397
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:12,855
Let's welcome Maya Sukumar,
second year, Media Arts.

398
00:34:17,334 --> 00:34:18,667
Hi everyone.

399
00:34:20,187 --> 00:34:25,853
I'm a Tamilian basically. Since my dad
belongs to air force, we migrate often.

400
00:34:26,228 --> 00:34:28,103
Now, here in Cochin.

401
00:34:28,812 --> 00:34:29,812
Is she fine?

402
00:34:31,853 --> 00:34:35,853
- Thank you
- Hey stop

403
00:34:36,103 --> 00:34:38,978
Stop it, be silent.

404
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:42,578
- What should I say?
- Say about you.

405
00:34:42,603 --> 00:34:44,312
She doesn't belong
to first year.

406
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:48,460
Second year.

407
00:34:48,728 --> 00:34:52,520
I am the firefly I
am the lightning

408
00:34:53,383 --> 00:34:56,592
I am the cloud and the rain

409
00:34:57,202 --> 00:35:00,493
I am the snowdrops
and the flowers

410
00:35:01,603 --> 00:35:04,520
I am the butterfly

411
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:08,520
Who am I, I wonder?

412
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:12,832
How can I tell that

413
00:35:13,317 --> 00:35:19,359
I blow like a breeze

414
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:23,728
To offer the sound of music

415
00:35:29,687 --> 00:35:30,812
Hey! Bowl now.

416
00:35:31,145 --> 00:35:32,145
Kishore you bowl.

417
00:35:48,262 --> 00:35:50,762
In this mighty beautiful
world I am a dancing bird

418
00:35:51,212 --> 00:35:54,712
I ll travel through the
moon and the stars

419
00:35:54,737 --> 00:35:58,136
There is no stopping
me in this life

420
00:35:58,395 --> 00:36:01,687
I ll fly across the skies

421
00:36:01,712 --> 00:36:07,504
I am a girl and a
woman Guess my age

422
00:36:08,801 --> 00:36:15,384
I am the wind and the
flower Guess my heart

423
00:36:15,943 --> 00:36:23,234
You know who I am I am the
woman of magic.. Maya

424
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:11,847
If you stare at my look and
style You'll be flattered

425
00:37:12,309 --> 00:37:18,101
An army will lose its war
Your heart will tremble

426
00:37:19,478 --> 00:37:26,687
When I walk the streets It
becomes an accident prone zone

427
00:37:26,712 --> 00:37:34,003
All the men in the world
idolize a women like me

428
00:37:47,304 --> 00:37:50,429
In this mighty beautiful
world I am a dancing bird

429
00:37:50,778 --> 00:37:54,223
I ll travel through the
moon and the stars

430
00:37:54,248 --> 00:37:57,248
There is no stopping
me in this life

431
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:01,535
I ll fly across the skies

432
00:38:22,661 --> 00:38:28,869
Will the clouds wait for directions
to bring rain to the earth

433
00:38:29,656 --> 00:38:36,697
Will the wind wait for situations
to bring the natural sound of music

434
00:38:36,979 --> 00:38:40,771
Young age don't see boundaries

435
00:38:40,796 --> 00:38:44,504
Walk as your heart says

436
00:38:44,529 --> 00:38:50,863
Flow like a river in
its natural course

437
00:39:17,399 --> 00:39:20,524
Seems Shaji gave you a love letter.
He is an utter waste.

438
00:39:20,721 --> 00:39:22,096
Don't fall in his trap.

439
00:39:22,721 --> 00:39:24,513
- Love is something else.
- What's it?

440
00:39:24,555 --> 00:39:26,555
It's a feeling. We need to get that spark.

441
00:39:27,305 --> 00:39:28,305
What's your point?

442
00:39:29,055 --> 00:39:32,346
Love at first sight, Shakespeare’s theory.
I strongly believe that.

443
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:33,930
Can't understand anything.

444
00:39:34,638 --> 00:39:38,534
Any girl born on this earth is
destined to a specific guy.

445
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:41,721
When the two meet each other,
they automatically fall in love.

446
00:39:42,096 --> 00:39:43,555
Some guy should be there for me.

447
00:39:44,221 --> 00:39:50,013
Had she read this letter once,
everything would've been alright.

448
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:53,096
You have been saying this for the
past two years and nothing happened.

449
00:39:53,221 --> 00:39:57,138
This is final year. If you don't do something different and impress her..

450
00:39:57,471 --> 00:39:58,971
You'll lose both love and your life.

451
00:40:02,846 --> 00:40:06,763
Gorgeous you and smart me..

452
00:40:06,888 --> 00:40:08,805
Time to get together..

453
00:40:09,096 --> 00:40:10,096
I don't know Malayalam.

454
00:40:10,583 --> 00:40:13,125
But this is a Tamil song.

455
00:40:13,971 --> 00:40:16,846
Language is not important for love.

456
00:40:17,346 --> 00:40:19,846
What's important is body language.

457
00:40:20,013 --> 00:40:21,263
Shaji, leave.

458
00:40:21,474 --> 00:40:24,432
My friends told me to move closer with you.

459
00:40:24,583 --> 00:40:28,500
- Tell me Maya..
- Leave my hand.

460
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,471
Tell me Maya.

461
00:40:30,596 --> 00:40:34,971
What are you doing senior? She
already told her disinterest.

462
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:39,524
Why are you misbehaving
without moving away decently?

463
00:40:39,649 --> 00:40:42,899
Who are you guys to ask?
Mind your own business.

464
00:40:43,013 --> 00:40:44,013
Come senior.

465
00:40:44,055 --> 00:40:47,680
- How dare you touch me?
- Shaji leave them!

466
00:40:51,346 --> 00:40:52,346
How dare you!

467
00:41:43,971 --> 00:41:45,263
Arun, no please.

468
00:41:45,638 --> 00:41:48,513
You need to defend back
the one who hit you.

469
00:41:49,653 --> 00:41:50,653
Go..

470
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:53,192
Shaji, no please.

471
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:57,805
I'll finish you off if you repeat it.

472
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,680
Are you a student or rogue?

473
00:42:13,971 --> 00:42:17,180
- How dare you hit a junior?
- They messed with Shaji first.

474
00:42:17,388 --> 00:42:18,388
This is the last warning.

475
00:42:19,513 --> 00:42:22,888
I'm excusing you as I don't want this
issue to affect your cricket selection.

476
00:42:25,555 --> 00:42:26,555
Who complained?

477
00:42:27,263 --> 00:42:29,263
Maya, second year, Media Arts.

478
00:42:37,699 --> 00:42:41,990
I unfurl as a flower.

479
00:42:42,546 --> 00:42:45,754
You come in search of the flower.

480
00:42:47,332 --> 00:42:51,415
I become one with the breeze.

481
00:42:57,305 --> 00:42:59,096
What? Have you come to create troubles?

482
00:42:59,555 --> 00:43:01,055
Come, we're ready too.

483
00:43:01,763 --> 00:43:05,638
Will you complain to the
principal if we excuse you?

484
00:43:07,305 --> 00:43:10,513
- What else will we do?
- Put your hands down.

485
00:43:10,888 --> 00:43:13,805
Being seniors will
you do anything?

486
00:43:14,013 --> 00:43:15,013
Stop.

487
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,221
Yes I complained.

488
00:43:18,888 --> 00:43:20,930
You always come to quarrel without
knowing what happened.

489
00:43:23,555 --> 00:43:26,221
Do you know what your friend did?
He misbehaved pulling my hands.

490
00:43:26,846 --> 00:43:29,221
Will you be quiet if your class
girl undergoes the same?

491
00:43:29,971 --> 00:43:30,971
That's why they asked.

492
00:43:31,221 --> 00:43:32,221
Apologize.

493
00:43:32,947 --> 00:43:36,322
- Ask sorry - Why should we?

494
00:43:36,513 --> 00:43:37,638
Ask sorry.

495
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,680
That fault is yours.

496
00:43:41,229 --> 00:43:43,946
No body in my family has the
practice of apologizing.

497
00:43:43,971 --> 00:43:44,971
Ask.

498
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:51,096
- Sorry - How will that suffice?
If you repeat it next time..

499
00:43:53,388 --> 00:43:56,180
He apologized. Go.

500
00:44:03,296 --> 00:44:04,879
Why did you ask me to apologize?

501
00:44:05,155 --> 00:44:07,780
- Why are you finding fault in him?
- He went mad?

502
00:44:07,805 --> 00:44:09,805
He insulted me in front of juniors.

503
00:44:33,055 --> 00:44:34,055
Here we go!

504
00:44:39,067 --> 00:44:44,359
When you glance at me
I feel electrified

505
00:44:48,898 --> 00:44:53,689
When you glance at me
I feel electrified

506
00:44:58,258 --> 00:45:02,592
An electrifying woman has thrown me far
at a glance, has taken my breath away,

507
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:07,596
I feel choked at her slightest glance on me
Just a look and She makes me beg for her love

508
00:45:20,846 --> 00:45:21,846
This is Maya's address.

509
00:45:27,221 --> 00:45:29,888
She made me run
She bullied me like a 'roaster'

510
00:45:30,305 --> 00:45:32,305
I melt like an ice-cream on a summer day
I roamed all the nights

511
00:45:37,221 --> 00:45:39,721
I stood brave and tall like a light house
I became a zero-voltage bulb

512
00:45:39,913 --> 00:45:41,805
She made a thief of me
peeking in to all houses for her

513
00:45:42,257 --> 00:45:44,446
She made an owl of me
staying awake all night for her

514
00:45:44,471 --> 00:45:46,996
She made a donkey of me
braying my throats dry

515
00:45:47,096 --> 00:45:49,305
She made a buffalo of me
roaming with no sense on skin for her

516
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:51,205
She made a monkey of
me jumping to find her

517
00:45:56,388 --> 00:45:59,596
A tea-shop besides a bus-stop

518
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:04,805
She made a fool out of me

519
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:09,638
The sight she glances The words she
utter My heart goes in a swing

520
00:46:10,296 --> 00:46:15,801
When I see her face When I hear
her voice I am going so high

521
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:25,015
When you glance at me
I feel electrified

522
00:46:30,138 --> 00:46:34,971
When you glance at me
I feel electrified

523
00:46:52,969 --> 00:46:55,885
Arun..

524
00:46:58,638 --> 00:46:59,638
What mom?

525
00:47:00,565 --> 00:47:02,357
Just one minute left for 12.

526
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:05,721
- So what?
- Tomorrow is 27th of September.

527
00:47:15,388 --> 00:47:16,388
Happy birthday Arun.

528
00:47:17,305 --> 00:47:23,013
- Thanks - I pray god for you to have all
happiness this year as well. God bless you.

529
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:29,805
He left, he doesn't need us.

530
00:47:31,064 --> 00:47:32,814
Why do you want me to talk to him ever year

531
00:47:33,013 --> 00:47:36,096
He left us, but he left you for me.

532
00:47:37,734 --> 00:47:39,442
May be he doesn't belong to my life..

533
00:47:40,221 --> 00:47:43,305
..but he'll always be in your life, as dad.

534
00:47:51,763 --> 00:47:53,305
Pass it here.

535
00:47:53,763 --> 00:47:54,763
Cover it.

536
00:48:01,732 --> 00:48:03,315
Welcome Chairman sir!

537
00:48:19,673 --> 00:48:21,632
- What's the score?
- I am surprised!

538
00:48:21,971 --> 00:48:24,346
Our college is likely to win.

539
00:48:38,138 --> 00:48:39,138
Super dude.

540
00:48:39,888 --> 00:48:41,388
We need to win the cup this time too.

541
00:48:42,805 --> 00:48:44,680
No matter what, we have to win.

542
00:49:00,888 --> 00:49:03,013
Oh god, what happened?

543
00:49:08,013 --> 00:49:11,805
What happened? Take him away.
Give him first aid.

544
00:49:12,388 --> 00:49:13,763
Sit, relax dude.

545
00:49:48,975 --> 00:49:52,338
Get out from here.

546
00:49:52,363 --> 00:49:54,655
You people hit our players.

547
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:57,238
If there is some one in this
college to play hockey...

548
00:49:57,263 --> 00:49:58,263
...call them.

549
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:01,221
Come. Let's fight it.

550
00:50:01,246 --> 00:50:02,871
You have hit our players
and talk nonsense now.

551
00:50:03,665 --> 00:50:05,457
We cannot change the rules
of the game for you.

552
00:50:05,888 --> 00:50:07,888
We don't have a
problem with that.

553
00:50:08,555 --> 00:50:11,763
Call out the guy who has
guts to play hockey here.

554
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:43,869
We may be in dispute with each other, but we
should show unity when our college is in trouble.

555
00:50:44,567 --> 00:50:47,442
You're a cricketer.
How will you play hockey?

556
00:50:47,846 --> 00:50:50,430
Both involves hitting the ball.
Let's see.

557
00:50:58,408 --> 00:51:01,408
- What are you doing?
- Sorry

558
00:51:12,794 --> 00:51:13,919
What are you doing?

559
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:16,555
Send him out, we may lose.

560
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:26,510
Block him.

561
00:51:27,096 --> 00:51:28,096
Hurry, hurry.

562
00:51:29,513 --> 00:51:30,513
Chase the ball.

563
00:51:30,888 --> 00:51:32,763
Don't leave.

564
00:51:34,771 --> 00:51:37,354
Quick, block it.

565
00:52:15,638 --> 00:52:16,638
Quick..

566
00:52:16,971 --> 00:52:17,971
Block it.

567
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:22,888
Quick..

568
00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:45,430
We were careless!

569
00:52:55,221 --> 00:52:56,221
Don't miss.

570
00:54:19,055 --> 00:54:20,055
Performance in Dubai.

571
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:23,543
- Excellent opportunity. Hi..

572
00:54:33,638 --> 00:54:35,346
Excuse me, hello.

573
00:54:36,221 --> 00:54:39,930
Excuse me, hello. One minute. Stop.

574
00:54:41,575 --> 00:54:42,992
- What.
- Thanks.

575
00:54:43,559 --> 00:54:44,136
What for?

576
00:54:44,388 --> 00:54:46,596
You came for my friends..

577
00:54:46,621 --> 00:54:49,621
Excuse me, it wasn't for your friends.
It was for my college.

578
00:54:52,258 --> 00:54:53,258
Sorry..

579
00:54:54,348 --> 00:54:54,931
What is it for?

580
00:54:55,091 --> 00:54:59,299
- I mistook you and complained to
principal - This is your last warning.

581
00:55:00,338 --> 00:55:01,338
You do this one more time..

582
00:55:05,275 --> 00:55:06,484
This is what principal told.

583
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:08,888
You apologise casually.

584
00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:12,150
Got scared?

585
00:55:16,013 --> 00:55:19,074
- Consider me as a friend instead
of complaining. - Of course

586
00:55:19,138 --> 00:55:20,846
- That's better.
- Friends!

587
00:55:24,805 --> 00:55:26,888
- Mam has come.
- Good Morning.

588
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:41,150
I saw you talking to Arun.

589
00:55:43,013 --> 00:55:44,555
Ya so?

590
00:55:45,221 --> 00:55:49,013
I like Maya so much.

591
00:55:49,449 --> 00:55:50,449
So?

592
00:55:50,474 --> 00:55:52,974
You should somehow tell him about me and..

593
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:56,221
Help me to get her.

594
00:55:58,596 --> 00:56:00,180
How can I talk for you?

595
00:56:01,596 --> 00:56:03,430
This is her phone number.

596
00:56:04,031 --> 00:56:05,031
Please help me.

597
00:56:15,179 --> 00:56:16,344
What are you going to talk?

598
00:56:18,513 --> 00:56:20,221
This is Arun.

599
00:56:22,044 --> 00:56:23,044
What if she asks which Arun?

600
00:56:23,221 --> 00:56:26,221
Hi Maya, I'm your senior.

601
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:30,221
There are many senior
students in college.

602
00:56:49,999 --> 00:56:51,332
- Hello.
- Hi.

603
00:56:51,559 --> 00:56:52,184

- Maya here.
- Which Maya?

605
00:56:56,138 --> 00:56:57,888
Your junior.

606
00:56:58,430 --> 00:56:59,805
We met even today.

607
00:57:00,404 --> 00:57:03,738
Many junior girls talk to me in college.
Which girl are you?

608
00:57:03,763 --> 00:57:07,971
Sorry, I think you don't remember.
It's okay.

609
00:57:09,471 --> 00:57:11,221

610
00:57:11,471 --> 00:57:12,596

611
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:15,596
Principal complaint Maya?

612
00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:20,247
- Sorry.

613
00:57:21,263 --> 00:57:25,930
- How did you get my number?
- I got your number from Pallavi.

614
00:57:26,346 --> 00:57:28,721
- Arun.

615
00:57:31,430 --> 00:57:34,055
I think you're busy. We'll talk later.

616
00:57:34,221 --> 00:57:37,221
- Nope, tell me.
- Nope nothing important.

617
00:57:38,055 --> 00:57:39,055
See you..

618
00:57:39,471 --> 00:57:40,471
When?

619
00:57:41,677 --> 00:57:42,677
Hello..

620
00:57:43,544 --> 00:57:44,544
He is asking me when.

00:57:51,805 --> 00:57:53,888

623
00:58:07,821 --> 00:58:08,696
How are you here?

624
00:58:08,721 --> 00:58:11,305
I didn't believe when you said that..

625
00:58:11,828 --> 00:58:13,453
..she'll come here.

626
00:58:13,638 --> 00:58:14,638
Thanks a lot.

627
00:58:15,138 --> 00:58:17,221
You need to do one thing. Listen.

628
00:58:17,846 --> 00:58:20,305
You need to say good
things about me to her.

629
00:58:21,305 --> 00:58:24,638
Create a good impression
on me in her mind.

630
00:58:27,715 --> 00:58:29,715
What? What's the problem?

631
00:58:30,468 --> 00:58:31,468
Costly restaurant.

632
00:58:32,279 --> 00:58:34,571
If she asks anything to eat..

633
00:58:34,596 --> 00:58:37,971
That's not a problem.

634
00:58:38,305 --> 00:58:40,180
No, have it all. Get her
whatever she wants.

635
00:58:40,399 --> 00:58:42,149
As per her wish.

636
00:58:42,408 --> 00:58:45,742
If you have balance money,
drink coffee with it.

637
00:58:46,135 --> 00:58:48,635
- Go fast.
- He's coming.

638
00:58:52,717 --> 00:58:54,383
- Hi.
- Hey hi.

639
00:58:54,408 --> 00:58:57,242
- Sorry that I'm late.
- It's okay.

640
00:58:57,763 --> 00:58:59,096
Gift? For me?

641
00:58:59,305 --> 00:59:01,638
- Actually, Pallavi..
- Order..

642
00:59:03,283 --> 00:59:09,700
A chicken burger, spring roll, chicken
pizza, and half plate Tandoori chicken.

643
00:59:12,218 --> 00:59:15,134
- For you?
- A coffee?

644
00:59:15,513 --> 00:59:17,971
- Coffee?
- Okay, one coffee.

645
00:59:18,601 --> 00:59:19,601
Then?

646
00:59:20,513 --> 00:59:25,013
- Pallavi.. - Leave that. We shall
talk something interesting.

647
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:28,567
You sing so well. Have you been
practicing since childhood?

648
00:59:30,388 --> 00:59:35,680
- I tried talking to him, but he kept on
diverting the topic. - Did you give the gift?

649
00:59:36,770 --> 00:59:39,353
Then there's nothing to worry.
He'll understand if he sees.

650
00:59:43,834 --> 00:59:44,834
Best friends!

651
00:59:46,715 --> 00:59:47,715
But it's in heart shape.

652
00:59:48,290 --> 00:59:49,832
What is she trying to say symbolically?

653
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:51,020
What is it?

654
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:55,957
Mom, I bought it. It was nice.
So I bought for me. Is it good?

655
00:59:58,936 --> 01:00:00,936
Will you wrap it like a gift for yourself?

656
01:00:08,574 --> 01:00:09,574
Silly guys!

657
01:00:16,936 --> 01:00:17,436
Hey..

658
01:00:18,311 --> 01:00:19,811
- Hey hi.
- Hi..

659
01:00:20,256 --> 01:00:23,006
Did you see the gift?

660
01:00:28,816 --> 01:00:29,816
Come here..

661
01:00:30,962 --> 01:00:33,170
- What happened?
- Why are you asking in front of her?

662
01:00:33,509 --> 01:00:37,509
- Why?
- She has been behind me for a long time.

663
01:00:38,270 --> 01:00:41,769
- Torturing so much.
- Don't you..

664
01:00:43,436 --> 01:00:43,978
Hi..

665
01:00:45,645 --> 01:00:47,061
Okay, see you.

666
01:00:58,022 --> 01:00:59,022
Did he see the gift?

667
01:01:00,978 --> 01:01:01,978
Did he see the gift?

668
01:01:06,895 --> 01:01:08,478
- What's your brother doing?
- Business.

669
01:01:08,619 --> 01:01:10,536
- Your brother?
- He is doing Engineering.

670
01:01:10,561 --> 01:01:12,978
My brother is an Engineer,

671
01:01:17,770 --> 01:01:19,103
- Hi.
- What happened?

672
01:01:19,436 --> 01:01:22,728
- Break time isn't it?
- We just met in the morning.

673
01:01:23,228 --> 01:01:27,478
- It's been 3 hours.
- Just 3 hours, not 3 days. - Yeah!

674
01:01:29,228 --> 01:01:31,186
- What's it?
- Nope, nothing important.

675
01:01:31,391 --> 01:01:34,599
- It's important.
- Be quiet.

676
01:01:36,717 --> 01:01:37,967
- Sure?
- Ya.

677
01:01:38,228 --> 01:01:39,395
Okay, see you.

678
01:01:39,853 --> 01:01:40,436
When?

679
01:01:44,436 --> 01:01:45,436
Go!

680
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:48,737
Maya is waiting.

681
01:01:48,895 --> 01:01:52,186
- I kept the money somewhere.
- Saying at the last minute.

682
01:01:53,256 --> 01:01:56,131
Have it. Go.

683
01:01:57,493 --> 01:02:00,368
- Hi. - Hi, what's it, you
wanted to meet urgently?

684
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:01,634
Just like that!

685
01:02:03,686 --> 01:02:05,770
- What happened?
- Nothing.

686
01:02:06,561 --> 01:02:08,561
I saw your gift. It was very nice.

687
01:02:08,675 --> 01:02:11,091
Actually, I..

688
01:02:11,866 --> 01:02:15,866
- Don't mistake me.
- No, I didn't mistake at all.

689
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:17,520
I understand.

690
01:02:18,436 --> 01:02:20,811
Would you like to have something?
Want to order? Go ahead.

691
01:02:36,145 --> 01:02:37,145
What is this?

692
01:02:38,311 --> 01:02:39,311
What is this?

693
01:02:41,199 --> 01:02:42,199
It was lying down.

694
01:02:47,936 --> 01:02:48,936
Some waste paper.

695
01:02:58,418 --> 01:03:01,126
- Excuse me..
- Yes..

696
01:03:02,603 --> 01:03:03,936

01:03:25,395 --> 01:03:27,811
- My work
- What's it?

702
01:03:28,592 --> 01:03:30,926
It's done. Why should we talk about it.
See you, bye.

703
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:36,061
So?

704
01:04:02,561 --> 01:04:07,311
You are the dark night
and I am the moon

705
01:04:07,615 --> 01:04:12,032
The time we spend
together is sheer bliss

706
01:04:12,622 --> 01:04:17,370
I am lost while I am alive

707
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:22,451
Is it love?

708
01:04:22,696 --> 01:04:27,571
You are the beach
and I am the waves

709
01:04:27,596 --> 01:04:35,429
My heart floats like a foam
I wish for our togetherness

710
01:04:35,842 --> 01:04:42,051
With the music of love
echoing throughout our lives

711
01:04:42,811 --> 01:04:51,728
A slight glance of yours kills me
And another glance gives me a rebirth

712
01:05:03,193 --> 01:05:07,527
You are the dark night
and I am the moon

713
01:05:08,051 --> 01:05:12,759
The time we spend
together is sheer bliss

714
01:05:13,254 --> 01:05:17,754
I am lost while I am alive

715
01:05:18,285 --> 01:05:23,285
Is it love?

716
01:05:57,927 --> 01:06:02,261
Is it your glance or your touch?

717
01:06:02,990 --> 01:06:07,782
Did my manhood excite you?

718
01:06:08,103 --> 01:06:12,895
Is it a fiery heat or freezing cold?

719
01:06:13,186 --> 01:06:17,811
Did my shyness fly off far from me?

720
01:06:18,121 --> 01:06:23,101
I wish for a world only for us

721
01:06:23,232 --> 01:06:27,649
I wish for your shoulders to lean

722
01:06:28,251 --> 01:06:38,043
I wish to utter your name and enjoy the
happiness I'll be reborn to live after death

723
01:06:38,467 --> 01:06:47,551
I wish for our togetherness
With the music of love echoing throughout our lives

724
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:17,120
- Creative strategies in advertising
include message. - Hello.

725
01:07:17,145 --> 01:07:22,853
Guys, our band is invited to
perform in Dubai annual festival.

726
01:07:22,878 --> 01:07:24,795
Shut up boys.

727
01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:26,070
Is this a class or something?
Get out.

728
01:07:26,328 --> 01:07:27,787
- Where is it? - In Dubai.

729
01:07:29,190 --> 01:07:30,857
- How many days?
- 10 days.

730
01:07:31,307 --> 01:07:35,057
Ten days? Super, enjoy.

731
01:07:37,106 --> 01:07:39,315
- Will your phone work?
- ISD roaming.

732
01:07:39,536 --> 01:07:42,036
- So..
- How will you communicate then?

733
01:07:43,710 --> 01:07:45,293
- Talk to whom?
- Nope..

734
01:07:46,007 --> 01:07:50,340
What if your parents want to talk?

735
01:07:50,566 --> 01:07:53,733
Local numbers will be available.
We can talk if I buy one.

736
01:07:54,085 --> 01:07:56,377
Buy it surely, it's a must.

737
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:58,286
For talking to my parents?

738
01:07:59,863 --> 01:08:00,863
Ya, what else?

739
01:08:11,630 --> 01:08:13,505
- See you.
- After ten days.

740
01:08:13,549 --> 01:08:14,549
Bye

741
01:08:44,843 --> 01:08:46,301
It's a minor fracture.
It will be all right.

742
01:08:46,486 --> 01:08:50,444
- Can we discharge doctor? - No, she has
to be here until the wound heals.

743
01:08:59,203 --> 01:09:03,578
- How is it now?
- Did you plan this to stop my Dubai plan?

744
01:09:15,442 --> 01:09:17,567
I'll be joining in two days. Ya, thank you.

745
01:09:17,846 --> 01:09:20,221
I find it so hard to take
leave from my office.

746
01:09:20,419 --> 01:09:23,128
I'm thinking to call my mom to
take care of her during day time.

747
01:09:23,625 --> 01:09:27,375
- Why should we trouble her at this age?
You can ask your sister. - Uncle..

748
01:09:28,057 --> 01:09:31,515
If you do not have any objection, I'll
take care of Maya during day time.

749
01:09:41,650 --> 01:09:44,441
Hi. That’s okay, I'm leaving.

750
01:09:45,953 --> 01:09:48,578
- Hello uncle.
- Sit, carry on.

751
01:09:52,848 --> 01:09:54,557
- It's okay.
- No problem uncle.

752
01:09:54,893 --> 01:09:56,809
- She'll be all right soon.
- I'm thankful to you

753
01:09:57,159 --> 01:09:58,159
Are you guys in love?

754
01:10:02,465 --> 01:10:05,132
- No dad.
- I'll happy if you do.

755
01:10:05,937 --> 01:10:07,770
It's tough to get guys of his kind.

756
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:10,455
You take rest.

757
01:10:24,370 --> 01:10:25,370
Got water?

758
01:10:25,573 --> 01:10:26,573
She is perfectly okay now.

759
01:10:27,156 --> 01:10:28,156
Thank you so much doctor.

760
01:10:28,530 --> 01:10:30,947
- Bye.
- OK Arun, come home sometime.

761
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:49,479
You said you'll need one week to get back.

762
01:10:49,504 --> 01:10:50,504
A surprise?

763
01:10:53,035 --> 01:10:55,244
- Maya, class is this way.
- I'll be back.

764
01:11:05,109 --> 01:11:06,692
You want to hear Mamooka's dialog?

765
01:11:06,989 --> 01:11:08,614
To temper the sword lesser than usual

766
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:11,960
Chandu bribed the blacksmith

767
01:11:14,286 --> 01:11:15,328
Milton..

768
01:11:17,179 --> 01:11:18,179
Where is Arun?

769
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:19,897
He didn't come to
college for one week.

770
01:11:20,333 --> 01:11:23,750
- Ya, in hospital..
- A girl's life is entirely wasted.

771
01:11:23,999 --> 01:11:25,207
What happened?

772
01:11:27,726 --> 01:11:29,601
You did everything and
asking what happened now?

773
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:30,880
I don't get you?

774
01:11:31,184 --> 01:11:33,018
Won't understand if a
girl enters your life.

775
01:11:34,335 --> 01:11:39,168
He kept practicing cricket for 3 years, but was with
you in hospital without coming for state selection.

776
01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:41,187
He has to forget cricket
in his entire life.

777
01:11:41,570 --> 01:11:42,570
There is no next time for him.

778
01:11:43,870 --> 01:11:44,870
Happy?

779
01:12:06,530 --> 01:12:07,197
Maya..

780
01:12:07,495 --> 01:12:11,703
I knew. I knew that you'll come for me.

781
01:12:13,403 --> 01:12:16,028
I've been waiting for this day.

782
01:12:16,551 --> 01:12:17,697
Not that, Maya..

783
01:12:17,847 --> 01:12:19,681
We need to thank Maya.

784
01:12:20,354 --> 01:12:25,562
She moved close with you to
express my love in-detail.

785
01:12:26,190 --> 01:12:31,731
When you got my gift from her, I
knew you have something for me.

786
01:12:32,695 --> 01:12:38,362
I'm happy that you understood
my love at least now.

787
01:12:49,036 --> 01:12:51,536
Arun has come searching for me today..

788
01:12:51,906 --> 01:12:54,823
It's all because of you.
Thank you so much Maya.

789
01:14:13,828 --> 01:14:14,828
Arun..

790
01:14:16,698 --> 01:14:17,864
I need to talk to you..

791
01:14:19,403 --> 01:14:20,445
In person..

792
01:14:20,848 --> 01:14:21,848
Let's go.

793
01:14:24,830 --> 01:14:27,621
I don't have anything to
talk to you in person.

794
01:14:28,156 --> 01:14:29,156
I understand your anger.

795
01:14:30,929 --> 01:14:33,512
- Even if I'm in your position..
- Can you come to the point?

796
01:14:34,598 --> 01:14:38,807
Pallavi may be the reason for me to
talk to you in the initial days..

797
01:14:40,716 --> 01:14:41,716
But..

798
01:14:42,418 --> 01:14:43,418
I really like you..

799
01:14:48,265 --> 01:14:49,265
Such beautiful eyes..

800
01:14:50,846 --> 01:14:52,137
Pretty smile..

801
01:14:53,414 --> 01:14:54,414
Beautiful hair..

802
01:14:56,203 --> 01:14:56,620
You..

803
01:14:56,620 --> 01:14:58,953
..will get an awesome guy.

804
01:15:04,761 --> 01:15:05,747
I know that you like me.

805
01:15:07,799 --> 01:15:08,799
..and you love me.

806
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:15,700
Am I in love with you?

807
01:15:22,870 --> 01:15:24,203
Don't cheat yourself Arun.

808
01:15:25,206 --> 01:15:26,206
I know.

809
01:15:27,484 --> 01:15:29,276
That's why you moved this close with me.

810
01:15:29,906 --> 01:15:31,156
Excuse me.

811
01:15:31,281 --> 01:15:32,948
I wasn't moving close
with you for my benefit.

812
01:15:35,734 --> 01:15:36,734
It was for him.

813
01:15:37,614 --> 01:15:40,281
He said he is loving you.
That's the reason. Got it?

814
01:15:41,536 --> 01:15:42,536
You want to know anything else?

815
01:15:46,465 --> 01:15:47,465
Don't lie.

816
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:49,676
You're lying.

817
01:15:50,382 --> 01:15:51,382
That's the truth.

818
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:55,104
I never liked you; I never loved you.

819
01:15:56,671 --> 01:15:57,671
Understand?

820
01:15:58,382 --> 01:15:59,382
Better understand.

821
01:16:20,370 --> 01:16:23,578
Assuming the sound may disturb..

822
01:16:33,619 --> 01:16:35,785
- What?
- What DA?

823
01:16:36,562 --> 01:16:37,854
Santhosh keeps on calling me.

824
01:16:40,455 --> 01:16:41,455
Tell me something.

825
01:16:56,624 --> 01:17:00,249
Why do you cut my calls? This
is an excellent opportunity.

826
01:17:02,156 --> 01:17:03,156
Please..

827
01:17:04,575 --> 01:17:05,534
Okay..

828
01:17:05,827 --> 01:17:07,994
- He agreed.
- Superb!

829
01:17:09,635 --> 01:17:11,426
Maya is not like other girls.

830
01:17:12,075 --> 01:17:13,075
She never comes out often.

831
01:17:13,411 --> 01:17:15,783
We came to know one thing
on inquiring about her.

832
01:17:15,808 --> 01:17:18,517
She never likes lying or liar either.

833
01:17:20,530 --> 01:17:22,405
She will liike us all then!

834
01:17:22,515 --> 01:17:27,057
She regularly visits music class
and recording studio, when needed.

835
01:17:27,825 --> 01:17:30,700
She visits Adyar flower shop on Sundays.

836
01:17:30,754 --> 01:17:33,754
She'll take the granny next
door to Besant Nagar church.

837
01:17:34,410 --> 01:17:37,910
Otherwise she steps only
on important occasions.

838
01:17:39,567 --> 01:17:43,276
Tomorrow is Sunday. She will
surely come to the flower shop.

839
01:17:45,578 --> 01:17:52,578
So that's where Operation
Santhosh starts.

840
01:17:56,445 --> 01:17:56,986
Move

841
01:17:57,486 --> 01:17:58,486
They say MOVE even
before they say ACTION!

842
01:18:04,945 --> 01:18:05,945
Uncle move.

843
01:18:06,403 --> 01:18:08,445
- What is it?
- Dad! Action!

844
01:18:16,570 --> 01:18:17,570
Music

845
01:18:21,702 --> 01:18:24,077
Inform everyone that they should
be doing the same when Maya comes.

846
01:18:25,001 --> 01:18:28,585
- Hey that flower...
- Is Maya a big heroine?

847
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:29,700
Won't she come for rehearsals?

848
01:18:30,692 --> 01:18:32,900
She is a bit busy...

849
01:18:34,384 --> 01:18:38,509
- It's wrong. In those days, Saroja Devi, K R Vijaya, Sowcar Janaki everyone....
- Uncle!

850
01:18:39,095 --> 01:18:42,887
We are losing the light. Cameraman
might get mad at us. Please go ahead.

851
01:18:42,983 --> 01:18:44,608
I have been searching
for him for long!

852
01:18:45,892 --> 01:18:48,767
All artists come here.
Come quick.

853
01:18:49,621 --> 01:18:55,204
- Please stay put at your positions. When the heroine comes, the director will say ACTION.
- MOVE!

854
01:18:58,486 --> 01:18:59,945
When he says MOVE, start moving.

855
01:19:00,085 --> 01:19:06,376
- Move now. Get back to your positions. Is it OK?
- Yeah OK!

856
01:19:17,903 --> 01:19:18,903
Ready

857
01:19:43,036 --> 01:19:45,036
- What's happening?
- I can't hear anything.

858
01:19:45,203 --> 01:19:47,161
What are you doing? Look here!

859
01:19:47,536 --> 01:19:50,703
No one is moving.
What's happening?

860
01:20:04,870 --> 01:20:05,870
Get to the van fast.

861
01:20:15,745 --> 01:20:18,703
What are you doing Arun?
Open the door.

862
01:20:18,870 --> 01:20:20,870
She is nearing. Say something.

863
01:20:24,786 --> 01:20:25,786
Hello.

864
01:20:34,536 --> 01:20:37,036
Arun! Arun!

865
01:20:37,870 --> 01:20:38,245
Move!

866
01:20:38,453 --> 01:20:38,953
Move!

867
01:20:44,203 --> 01:20:45,203
You bloody dad!

868
01:20:51,286 --> 01:20:52,370
You stupid dad!

869
01:20:53,090 --> 01:20:56,215
Maya is that side.
Please go there.

870
01:20:57,495 --> 01:20:59,245
Go to the other side.

871
01:21:25,745 --> 01:21:27,161
Oops! Dust in my eyes!

872
01:21:48,536 --> 01:21:50,744
You spoiled a big opportunity.

873
01:21:51,453 --> 01:21:53,244
We wanted the first
impression to be the best

874
01:21:54,119 --> 01:21:55,119
You have made it the
worst impression

875
01:21:55,994 --> 01:22:00,119
We planned it in a wonderful
way and you spoiled it!

876
01:22:00,144 --> 01:22:01,144
I did give the instructions properly

877
01:22:01,891 --> 01:22:04,183
You people didn't hear them.
What can I do?

878
01:22:04,606 --> 01:22:05,606
We also don't know what to do!

879
01:22:06,786 --> 01:22:11,078
She is not the social type. She steps out once in
a blue moon. It's difficult to meet her again.

880
01:22:11,661 --> 01:22:12,661
What if she doesn't come?

881
01:22:14,703 --> 01:22:15,703
We will make her step out.

882
01:22:20,369 --> 01:22:22,203
- Excuse me
- Yeah

883
01:22:22,619 --> 01:22:26,619
- Is Mr.Premlal available?
- Oh! Have you come to meet Laljisir?

884
01:22:28,244 --> 01:22:31,244
- Yes - Please wait. His PA
will be here in a moment.

885
01:22:31,578 --> 01:22:32,578
- Please sit here.
- Thanks.

886
01:22:37,453 --> 01:22:39,953
We have Hrithik Roshan
movie's re-recording on 5th.

887
01:22:40,197 --> 01:22:41,197
Evening?

888
01:22:41,369 --> 01:22:43,328
Evening he has to attend
Salman Khan's family function.

889
01:22:43,953 --> 01:22:44,953
Hi Sir!

890
01:22:46,814 --> 01:22:49,439
On 11th? We have
Arnold's music launch.

891
01:22:50,244 --> 01:22:52,911
So... Call me after 7 years.

892
01:22:56,953 --> 01:22:59,036
- Who is Nithya here?
- I am Nithya.

893
01:22:59,578 --> 01:23:03,369
You may be a great person in your place.
But all that will not be of use here.

894
01:23:04,036 --> 01:23:07,036
All that is required
here is Talent!

895
01:23:08,494 --> 01:23:10,911
- Can you please vouch for me?
- What nonsense!

896
01:23:11,348 --> 01:23:15,598
Lalji sir does not like
the word Recommendation!

897
01:23:17,078 --> 01:23:18,203
Sir Please!

898
01:23:20,161 --> 01:23:22,869
He has already selected a voice.

899
01:23:23,453 --> 01:23:28,953
So how much ever you
plead, the answer is a NO

900
01:23:29,421 --> 01:23:33,911
Hey! Don't use your own dialogues.
Just talk the script only.

901
01:23:34,869 --> 01:23:38,494
- Move!
- I'll see you outside!

902
01:23:44,489 --> 01:23:46,489
Who are you? You look like you
have come from Fashion TV midway!

903
01:23:46,890 --> 01:23:50,431
I got a call from your office
for a recording. I am Maya.

904
01:23:50,692 --> 01:23:52,900
Hey Maya! Lucky girl.

905
01:23:55,986 --> 01:24:00,829
If Lalji sir has liked your voice,
then you have a lot of talent.

906
01:24:01,369 --> 01:24:02,369
Come baby, let's rock the world.

907
01:24:08,817 --> 01:24:10,484
Maya is coming inside. Be ready.

908
01:24:10,828 --> 01:24:11,828
Step inside with your right hand.

909
01:24:11,994 --> 01:24:15,369
The one singing
there is Lalji sir.

910
01:24:17,403 --> 01:24:18,403
Lalji sir!

911
01:24:19,703 --> 01:24:20,703
Maya

912
01:24:20,953 --> 01:24:24,619
Wow! Welcome my dear.

913
01:24:25,036 --> 01:24:26,453
Greeting sir!

914
01:24:27,254 --> 01:24:30,087
- Do you speak Hindi?
- Yes sir. I speak very well.

915
01:24:30,671 --> 01:24:32,462
I have been learning Hindi
from my second grade.

916
01:24:33,374 --> 01:24:36,457
My father was also working
in the Navy in North India

917
01:24:36,786 --> 01:24:38,494
Well... Well...

918
01:24:38,828 --> 01:24:42,828
- So we can all talk in Tamil.
- Oh yes!

919
01:24:43,101 --> 01:24:44,101
This is Director Sharma.

920
01:24:44,536 --> 01:24:49,328
He went to North from the south and proved his talent
there. Now he is back to the south to prove here!

921
01:24:51,585 --> 01:24:52,585
Haven't you heard of him?

922
01:24:53,786 --> 01:24:56,161
No isn't it? That's why I said.

923
01:24:57,861 --> 01:25:02,361
- Namakkam!
- Since he has been throughout India, he mixes Namaste and Vanakkam. Namakkam!

924
01:25:03,946 --> 01:25:04,946
- Namakkam!

925
01:25:05,906 --> 01:25:08,031
She seems to have like it!

926
01:25:10,869 --> 01:25:11,869
Sir!

927
01:25:12,036 --> 01:25:13,703
- What?
- Tune

928
01:25:15,953 --> 01:25:20,161
You please get inside the voice booth.
We will play the tune.

929
01:25:20,341 --> 01:25:24,119
- Booth is there. Shall we?
- Please go.

930
01:25:24,801 --> 01:25:28,460
- Arun! Start the tune.
- Yeah.

931
01:25:28,869 --> 01:25:29,953
Is the tune ready?

932
01:25:31,273 --> 01:25:36,856
You called me saying that it is a big movie by a
famous director. Everything seems to be a drama here!

933
01:25:37,661 --> 01:25:41,078
Lot of people from Drama have made it
big in Cinema. Please play the tune.

934
01:25:43,953 --> 01:25:46,369
Sir. Which scale shall I sing in?

935
01:25:47,536 --> 01:25:48,828
Which scale!

936
01:25:49,953 --> 01:25:52,078
How about half a foot scale?

937
01:25:53,536 --> 01:25:54,536
One foot scale?

938
01:25:55,703 --> 01:25:56,703
One and a half foot?

939
01:25:57,911 --> 01:26:01,744
Whichever scale is comfortable
for you sing in that scale.

940
01:26:02,619 --> 01:26:03,619
Which scale should it be sung in?

941
01:26:05,911 --> 01:26:06,619
A minor.

942
01:26:07,828 --> 01:26:09,119
- A...
- A minor.

943
01:26:13,244 --> 01:26:17,036
- Yes. That's fine.
- That's the talent!

944
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:19,844
Sing now.

945
01:26:20,353 --> 01:26:21,478
Arun! Lights off!

946
01:26:23,703 --> 01:26:26,786
Santhosh! Come and stand
near the mark here.

947
01:26:27,536 --> 01:26:28,536
Switch on the lights.

948
01:26:30,119 --> 01:26:32,119
- Ghost!
- Why have you switched on just one light? Put them all.

949
01:26:35,786 --> 01:26:39,911
Good that the lights have come
when you came. It's a good sign!

950
01:26:40,328 --> 01:26:42,953
This is our producer, the
MD of Green Valley homes.

951
01:26:44,337 --> 01:26:52,462
He has been adamant on doing a music album with you after
listening to the jingle you sang for his company ad.

952
01:26:54,411 --> 01:26:57,203
Actually you have to thank him.

953
01:27:00,244 --> 01:27:01,244
Thank him.

954
01:27:03,578 --> 01:27:04,578
Thank you.

955
01:27:08,439 --> 01:27:09,439
Enough. Go for the take.

956
01:27:10,453 --> 01:27:10,994
Start playing.

957
01:27:11,249 --> 01:27:14,749
Take.

958
01:28:15,228 --> 01:28:16,228
Arun

959
01:28:18,203 --> 01:28:20,703
What are you doing here? Maya is
coming after finishing the song.

960
01:28:29,411 --> 01:28:32,578
She has got an awesome voice.
Can be used in movies.

961
01:28:35,205 --> 01:28:40,414
- What a voice Maya!
- Maya is magic!

962
01:28:42,410 --> 01:28:43,410
Thank you sir!

963
01:28:43,563 --> 01:28:44,563
I thought your voice was beautiful...

964
01:28:46,203 --> 01:28:48,994
.. but you look much
prettier than your voice.

965
01:28:51,869 --> 01:28:55,786
- Who gave this dialog?
- It's me. Look how it is working.

966
01:28:58,536 --> 01:28:59,536
Thank you.

967
01:29:06,828 --> 01:29:11,536
It has been awesome! He has
always treated me well at this house.

968
01:29:12,119 --> 01:29:16,619
- Lot of wonderful recipes
- Oh come on!

969
01:29:16,994 --> 01:29:17,994
Arun

970
01:29:21,790 --> 01:29:27,082
- Join us Arun
- Please come

971
01:29:29,244 --> 01:29:34,119
This is my college friend Raghu. This is his wife,
elder daughter Pavithra and younger one Anitha.

972
01:29:38,036 --> 01:29:40,078
You seem to be busy
even on Sundays!

973
01:29:40,619 --> 01:29:43,786
It's a very stressful job.
He works even on Sundays!

974
01:29:44,536 --> 01:29:47,744
- Where did you say he is working?
- UMT

975
01:29:48,286 --> 01:29:53,161
- It's the subsidiary of HMT. He is
the head of assembling department.
- Good

976
01:30:06,703 --> 01:30:09,911
I was also not interested
in the beginning.

977
01:30:15,632 --> 01:30:19,965
I came here because
my dad forced me.

978
01:30:21,161 --> 01:30:23,661
But after I came here...

979
01:30:24,536 --> 01:30:29,119
I liked uncle, aunty and Keerthi.

980
01:30:30,921 --> 01:30:31,921
You too..

981
01:30:36,703 --> 01:30:38,203
Silence means acceptance

982
01:30:38,578 --> 01:30:42,661
Arun is an introvert. I didn't inform him
of your visit and so he is a bit shocked.

983
01:30:43,119 --> 01:30:51,093
We accept this proposal. You discuss with Arun and
let me know on the dates to fix the marriage hall.

984
01:30:51,369 --> 01:30:53,119
Very happy! Please
do visit our house.

985
01:30:53,328 --> 01:30:58,328
- Why did you ask them to come?
- If we ask you, you wouldn't agree. So we asked them to come.

986
01:30:58,703 --> 01:31:02,203
- They like you very much.
- Should I agree to it if they like?

987
01:31:02,622 --> 01:31:03,622
Did I ask for marriage?

988
01:31:10,066 --> 01:31:11,066
She is a good girl.

989
01:31:12,333 --> 01:31:13,333
I'll be happy if it happens.

990
01:31:17,004 --> 01:31:18,837
I wish for it to happen.

991
01:31:27,119 --> 01:31:31,244
I have spent Rs.13,45,650 so far...

992
01:31:32,264 --> 01:31:33,286
.. to record a song.

993
01:31:34,181 --> 01:31:37,473
so, we have Rs.84,54,350 balance...

994
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:41,423
- What?
- You were ready to spend up to a crore!

995
01:31:43,286 --> 01:31:45,119
Why do you look at it like business?

996
01:31:45,303 --> 01:31:47,969
This is not a business for me.
But it is a business for you.

997
01:31:47,994 --> 01:31:51,578
Why are you worried? We can record 4 more
songs and make money out of the album!

998
01:31:51,961 --> 01:31:55,961
- Did I come to you all to make a movie?
- No.. Music... Maya... Money...

999
01:31:56,911 --> 01:31:57,911
What's wrong in making a movie?

1000
01:31:59,199 --> 01:32:02,907
Why can't we make a music video with Maya?

1001
01:32:02,932 --> 01:32:06,016
How can I get close to her if you
shoot a music video with her?

1002
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:10,917
- It is possible. Because for the music video...
- I got it...

1003
01:32:11,205 --> 01:32:18,539
We will convince Maya for the music video and on the day of the
shoot we will use Santhosh quoting the lead model's absence.

1004
01:32:19,369 --> 01:32:20,369
Isn't that your plan?

1005
01:32:21,119 --> 01:32:25,328
- That's a wonderful idea.
- Maya will fall for you this time.

1006
01:32:26,273 --> 01:32:29,564
Sorry. I am not interested in acting.

1007
01:32:29,786 --> 01:32:34,578
Singing is my passion. So I
sang for you when you called.

1008
01:32:35,078 --> 01:32:40,369
Already the song is a hit in India. If it has to be a
hit internationally, we need to make a music video.

1009
01:32:42,453 --> 01:32:45,036
Hit? I haven't heard it so far!

1010
01:32:46,611 --> 01:32:49,111
You didn't hear isn't it? That's
why we need to make a music video.

1011
01:32:49,953 --> 01:32:54,953
- Madam! Order please.
- One cold coffee.

1012
01:32:56,684 --> 01:32:58,767
Hey! That's Karthik's
father in law.

1013
01:32:59,953 --> 01:33:01,411
Why is he coming here?

1014
01:33:02,156 --> 01:33:05,864
- Lavanya! Stop him. Go stop him.

1015
01:33:06,536 --> 01:33:09,619
Sorry sir. We have a private function
and so outsiders are not allowed.

1016
01:33:09,963 --> 01:33:13,172
- I feel very hungry and I need to eat.
- I understand but...

1017
01:33:13,208 --> 01:33:16,125
We have a special offer for lovers.
Would you like to try that?

1018
01:33:17,415 --> 01:33:19,249
Lovers?

1019
01:33:19,574 --> 01:33:21,820
Yes. Aren't they lovers?

1020
01:33:21,845 --> 01:33:26,261
If they look like a beautiful
pair, are they lovers?

1021
01:33:26,286 --> 01:33:29,494
- I am so sorry.
- Will you let me in or not?

1022
01:33:29,828 --> 01:33:34,536
- There is a restaurant outside.
- Why should I go there? Anyway I am paying.

1023
01:33:35,494 --> 01:33:38,286
Don't keep talking. I am very hungry.
Let me in.

1024
01:33:42,119 --> 01:33:45,203
What is happening here? Did you
call some agent other than me?

1025
01:33:45,744 --> 01:33:46,744
I don't want coffee.

1026
01:33:47,786 --> 01:33:50,744
- How many artists have you informed to come?
- I don't want tea too.

1027
01:33:51,761 --> 01:33:56,657
- That guy is talking extra dialogues. He is not even a member.
- Yes. That table there!

1028
01:33:56,682 --> 01:33:59,099
- You are irritating me. Why should I go out?
- Sir please!

1029
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:03,470
Maya

1030
01:34:04,453 --> 01:34:05,453
Would you like to order something?

1031
01:34:05,578 --> 01:34:09,078
- Why shouldn't I go in?
- Sorry sir! Impossible to let you in.

1032
01:34:09,118 --> 01:34:12,827
- Why do you keep talking like a woman? Let me in.
- Sir please!

1033
01:34:14,286 --> 01:34:17,911
- Go stop him!
- What will I do?

1034
01:34:19,817 --> 01:34:25,109
You! Stop there! You! Why do you run?

1035
01:34:26,161 --> 01:34:32,661
We can reap profits if you decide.
He has been struggling for long.

1036
01:34:33,171 --> 01:34:41,254
- Is he not the MD of Green Valley homes?
- No. He has only Green Valley. Only if you wish he will be able to build homes! Please baby.

1037
01:34:41,994 --> 01:34:42,994
Please.

1038
01:35:01,536 --> 01:35:04,953
If this music video gets over, our
Operation Santhosh is a success

1039
01:35:05,661 --> 01:35:07,536
Your plan is working
out very well.

1040
01:35:13,578 --> 01:35:14,744
You practice now.

1041
01:35:15,703 --> 01:35:18,953
Wonderful! Awesome!

1042
01:35:19,395 --> 01:35:24,062
- Hi. Who is this?
- This is Arun, the director of this show.

1043
01:35:24,212 --> 01:35:31,004
- Are the steps fine?
- The steps look to be very intimate.

1044
01:35:31,186 --> 01:35:32,811
The song is very romantic.

1045
01:35:33,119 --> 01:35:43,411
- Can you choreograph steps in such a way
where they don't touch each other?
 - Of Course!

1046
01:35:45,353 --> 01:35:46,353
You go there.

1047
01:35:48,265 --> 01:35:51,101
- You be here.
- Is the gap required?

1048
01:35:51,126 --> 01:35:51,585
Yes

1049
01:35:51,610 --> 01:35:53,777
- Why?
- The director asked for it.

1050
01:35:56,515 --> 01:35:58,765
Are you ready? Shall we?

1051
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:07,692
No. Maintain the gap. You
dance in your positions. Is that OK?

1052
01:36:10,392 --> 01:36:15,851
- These days people who don't know about dance become directors!What to do!
- Yes master!

1053
01:36:17,038 --> 01:36:19,621
For this, they can dance
in their houses, alone!

1054
01:36:22,272 --> 01:36:24,897
We should not jump to the
10th step immediately.

1055
01:36:25,578 --> 01:36:28,619
We should go step by step.
This is the first step.

1056
01:36:30,411 --> 01:36:31,911
This concept is fine
as the first step.

1057
01:36:33,078 --> 01:36:38,786
- Hi Maya baby!
- Hi.
- Meet Gayathri Raghuram master, World's leading choreographer.

1058
01:36:38,828 --> 01:36:40,119
Hello master.

1059
01:36:40,203 --> 01:36:42,619
- Haven't you watched Maanaada Mayilaada?
- That is Kala master.

1060
01:36:43,124 --> 01:36:46,332
You all belong to the same family. She
is the choreographer of our album.

1061
01:36:46,619 --> 01:36:51,494
- Oh my god!
- There is some problem outside.
- The model hasn't come yet?

1062
01:36:51,984 --> 01:36:55,400
Do you know the struggle
of my producer?

1063
01:36:55,828 --> 01:37:00,078
He has missed the flight. Next flight is only in
the eve and we have planned the shoot only today.

1064
01:37:00,453 --> 01:37:04,661
My poor producer. An eligible bachelor. You know how
much he is struggling without homes in his valley?

1065
01:37:04,993 --> 01:37:08,577
- Isn't he the model?
- Wow master. Wonderful choice.

1066
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:12,416
You have the eyes of Aishwarya Rai and the
body of Salman Khan. Why don't you do it?

1067
01:37:12,989 --> 01:37:16,406
The loss is for you isn't it?
Please do it.

1068
01:37:17,548 --> 01:37:19,048
Isn't he the one
who should do it?

1069
01:37:21,455 --> 01:37:26,455
- That's what we are also saying. Shouldn't he be doing it?
- Do whatever you want!

1070
01:37:39,317 --> 01:37:41,109
Good. Are you ready?

1071
01:37:42,387 --> 01:37:49,262
- I can't bear their torture!
- You are worried about the model's absence! The director has not arrived yet!

1072
01:37:49,704 --> 01:37:53,413
I am the director.

1073
01:37:53,705 --> 01:38:00,914
- You are the director? Who was the one who was breaking
my head the other day? - He is just the show director.

1074
01:38:02,758 --> 01:38:07,174
- He won't come isn't it?
- Whatever we do..
- He will take care of it..

1075
01:38:07,742 --> 01:38:10,242
- Namakkam
- Namakkam

1076
01:38:12,132 --> 01:38:13,840
- Old steps.
- OK Master.

1077
01:38:44,786 --> 01:38:46,786
- Who changed the steps?
- What can I do?

1078
01:38:47,364 --> 01:38:50,572
The master says that the chemistry will
work out only if the steps are intimate.

1079
01:38:52,492 --> 01:38:58,825
You are present, yet lost

1080
01:38:58,911 --> 01:39:05,828
Making me alive yet lost in life

1081
01:39:07,208 --> 01:39:10,541
I see mirages of your face everywhere
that is instilled in my heart

1082
01:39:10,953 --> 01:39:14,177
Why have you left me deserted?

1083
01:39:14,619 --> 01:39:17,911
My eyes filled with tears
My heart filled with love

1084
01:39:18,328 --> 01:39:21,619
Where is the face that
is filled with smiles?

1085
01:39:28,578 --> 01:39:34,119
You are present, yet lost

1086
01:39:34,869 --> 01:39:42,078
Making me alive yet lost in life

1087
01:40:21,136 --> 01:40:24,636
There is no shadow without light

1088
01:40:24,887 --> 01:40:28,179
I am lost without you

1089
01:40:28,578 --> 01:40:32,078
The sky seems dark even after the sun rise

1090
01:40:32,119 --> 01:40:35,244
The snow covers the path

1091
01:40:35,449 --> 01:40:38,324
And it rains in the scorching sun

1092
01:40:39,594 --> 01:40:43,094
It's a sheer bliss when you are near me
Let me enjoy it again

1093
01:40:43,322 --> 01:40:46,656
Like the flowers stamped on the roads
My love for you is hurt

1094
01:40:47,103 --> 01:40:50,312
Days and nights shall pass
My dreams for you shall remain

1095
01:40:50,337 --> 01:40:54,420
Come to me, my dear!

1096
01:40:54,445 --> 01:41:00,404
You are present, yet lost

1097
01:41:00,822 --> 01:41:08,531
Making me alive yet lost in life

1098
01:41:54,953 --> 01:42:02,036
There's nothing permanent in this life other than change
Rainbows are not formed only by a rain

1099
01:42:02,411 --> 01:42:05,869
My heart isn't listening anymore

1100
01:42:05,869 --> 01:42:12,453
The love that is closer to you
Seems magnified when it is far

1101
01:42:13,261 --> 01:42:17,053
I see it and I lose it
The very mirages of your face

1102
01:42:17,078 --> 01:42:20,453
Dreams sleeping with me through the nights
are a sheer bliss of love

1103
01:42:20,738 --> 01:42:23,821
I find ourselves distanced by time
My heart longs for you

1104
01:42:24,075 --> 01:42:28,242
Come to me, my dear!

1105
01:42:28,666 --> 01:42:33,375
You are present, yet lost

1106
01:42:34,369 --> 01:42:35,369
Oh God!

1107
01:42:37,786 --> 01:42:38,786
- Maya
- Wait.

1108
01:42:40,036 --> 01:42:42,161
- Maya one second.
- Oh gosh!

1109
01:42:47,611 --> 01:42:48,611
- Hello
- Hi

1110
01:42:50,778 --> 01:42:51,778
- Hi
- Who is it?

1111
01:42:53,111 --> 01:42:57,194
It's me Pavithra. I had asked Keerthi
to pass on my number. Didn't she?

1112
01:42:57,778 --> 01:42:58,778
No

1113
01:42:59,653 --> 01:43:01,944
Are you busy? Can we talk?

1114
01:43:02,881 --> 01:43:06,381
- I am a little busy.
- So you cannot talk?

1115
01:43:07,319 --> 01:43:09,986
- Traffic...
- That's OK. We'll talk in person.

1116
01:43:15,447 --> 01:43:18,197
Network traffic in the signal.

1117
01:43:18,978 --> 01:43:23,186
I know you are a shy person. I have
understood everything about you.

1118
01:43:23,778 --> 01:43:25,403
Don't you have to know about me.

1119
01:43:26,552 --> 01:43:30,219
- Why should I get to know you?
- If we get to know each other only then we can lead a happy life.

1120
01:43:30,944 --> 01:43:35,569
- To decide..
- We need to decide that...

1121
01:43:36,879 --> 01:43:39,879
It is not easy to get the marriage
hall on the specified dates.

1122
01:43:40,403 --> 01:43:44,486
- The boy is very shy.
- Don't worry! We will take care of it.

1123
01:43:48,403 --> 01:43:52,111
We thought everything will be sorted out.
But now it is ruined.

1124
01:43:52,403 --> 01:43:57,694
I came to you guys after hearing a lot about
you. But now it looks like I've made a mistake.

1125
01:44:00,528 --> 01:44:02,444
Why? What happened?

1126
01:44:02,444 --> 01:44:06,986
If it was my business, I would've
completed the deal in a single meeting.

1127
01:44:07,528 --> 01:44:11,611
You would finish the business in a
jiffy, but what about the building?

1128
01:44:13,012 --> 01:44:16,595
We have just laid the foundation.

1129
01:44:17,911 --> 01:44:19,202
We have to raise the building now.

1130
01:44:20,611 --> 01:44:26,028
- He seems to increase the expectations.
- What is next?

1131
01:44:26,653 --> 01:44:27,653
Fight

1132
01:44:31,356 --> 01:44:32,356
Good idea.

1133
01:44:33,569 --> 01:44:36,586
- You don't want a dupe. Do you?
- I am OK with punches and kicks.

1134
01:44:36,611 --> 01:44:38,903
We will use a dupe for
flying and falling.

1135
01:44:52,951 --> 01:44:54,660
You called me to talk something.

1136
01:44:57,028 --> 01:45:00,236
I've been thinking of it.

1137
01:45:02,420 --> 01:45:08,753
- We need to get rid of Sekar.
- He seems to overdo things.

1138
01:45:08,988 --> 01:45:14,113
Where are you guys going? There is a
shooting going on. Just go on your way.

1139
01:45:16,872 --> 01:45:22,039
- He seems to show off.
- He is always in talks with girls.

1140
01:45:24,279 --> 01:45:25,279
Hello

1141
01:45:26,569 --> 01:45:27,569
Excuse me

1142
01:45:30,365 --> 01:45:31,365
What's the time?

1143
01:45:34,449 --> 01:45:35,449
3.20 PM

1144
01:45:37,355 --> 01:45:40,063
Why are you guys just going
after taking the money?

1145
01:45:41,782 --> 01:45:45,574
What are you saying? Which money?

1146
01:45:46,024 --> 01:45:48,441
He has mistaken those
rogues for our men.

1147
01:45:48,903 --> 01:45:52,153
What? They didn't pay you?

1148
01:45:53,998 --> 01:45:59,082
- First let me hit you. I will settle the payment later.
- Why should we get hit by you?

1149
01:46:01,048 --> 01:46:02,048
What are you talking?

1150
01:46:02,704 --> 01:46:06,537
- Get away or I will thrash your face.
- Correct. Show more emotion.

1151
01:46:06,611 --> 01:46:11,278
- Any problem Santhosh?
- Yes. Problem for them.

1152
01:46:12,214 --> 01:46:16,759
Will I spare them if
they make fun of you?

1153
01:46:16,871 --> 01:46:19,454
Are you showing off
because she is around?

1154
01:46:20,748 --> 01:46:27,248
- Thank God. You guys are following the script only now.
- Why is he talking like a lunatic? Get lost now.

1155
01:46:27,645 --> 01:46:29,645
This is enough.

1156
01:46:31,819 --> 01:46:33,528
He is not the one.

1157
01:46:33,569 --> 01:46:36,153
Karthik. Tell him that
they are not our guys.

1158
01:46:38,251 --> 01:46:40,751
Why did you hit them? They are not our men.
They are true rogues.

1159
01:46:45,865 --> 01:46:48,157
Get back to your houses safely.

1160
01:46:50,293 --> 01:46:51,293
It's OK. Come.

1161
01:48:55,384 --> 01:48:57,134
Why is she running?

1162
01:48:57,611 --> 01:49:00,319
Run now. Get to the other side.

1163
01:49:01,694 --> 01:49:04,611
Take him to the hospital.
Call the ambulance.

1164
01:49:09,694 --> 01:49:12,194
Run now. She is right behind us.

1165
01:49:18,944 --> 01:49:23,028
- Thank God. Is the scene OK?
- Don't pull words out of my mouth.

1166
01:49:25,772 --> 01:49:27,772
- Maya didn't see isn't it?
- Just missed.

1167
01:49:34,845 --> 01:49:38,637
Ready Ready. Come on boys.

1168
01:49:39,527 --> 01:49:43,318
Generally the cops are late during a stunt.
Why are you rogues late? Get lost now.

1169
01:49:43,528 --> 01:49:45,986
- Pack up is it?
- They are paying double the rates. Would you want it?

1170
01:49:49,403 --> 01:49:53,194
- Excuse me. Patient Santhosh?
- Fourth room on the right.

1171
01:50:01,271 --> 01:50:06,688
- How are the reports?
- A and B centres are fine. But C centre will not sustain.

1172
01:50:07,103 --> 01:50:09,603
Doctor. They are asking
about these reports.

1173
01:50:10,819 --> 01:50:16,194
Oh this one. It' very bad. Very very bad!

1174
01:50:16,444 --> 01:50:20,278
He was alright. He was the one who
messaged me the hospital details.

1175
01:50:20,677 --> 01:50:26,427
- Message? When was it? BC or AC?
- What does that mean?
- Before Coma or After Coma.

1176
01:50:26,569 --> 01:50:27,569
- Coma?
- Yes

1177
01:50:30,444 --> 01:50:33,653
- The bruises were not so serious.
- He is the doctor.

1178
01:50:35,086 --> 01:50:38,544
The ones who hit him were real rogues.
What else do you expect?

1179
01:50:38,569 --> 01:50:41,111
I had informed them
about the Stunt union...

1180
01:50:42,028 --> 01:50:47,028
- Why are you putting an injection?
- You have taken two rooms here so you need to put an injection.

1181
01:50:48,181 --> 01:50:51,598
They never inquired anything about the
disease before putting the injection.

1182
01:51:00,944 --> 01:51:03,861
Wow! It's a medical miracle.

1183
01:51:04,028 --> 01:51:05,569
He has responded to your call.

1184
01:51:05,819 --> 01:51:08,694
- We didn't call him.
- Who called you here?

1185
01:51:10,208 --> 01:51:13,624
All this is because of me...

1186
01:51:16,660 --> 01:51:17,660
Maya

1187
01:51:18,628 --> 01:51:21,503
Vishnu. Put the mask on.

1188
01:51:21,528 --> 01:51:23,528
Let Santhosh not speak now.

1189
01:51:25,153 --> 01:51:28,236
He is injured in the nose and cannot
breathe properly. This is for oxygen.

1190
01:51:37,569 --> 01:51:42,153
His hand is also injured with multiple
fractures. Please do not touch.

1191
01:51:42,611 --> 01:51:46,778
Do not touch. Please.

1192
01:51:48,528 --> 01:51:52,028
- She was so close and I missed.
- A kiss is it?

1193
01:51:54,403 --> 01:51:59,278
If not for the mask, I would have told her
that it was all for her. You guys ruined it.

1194
01:51:59,694 --> 01:52:03,569
- Why are we required if you can say? We'll make Maya to say that.
- You keep telling this!

1195
01:52:04,486 --> 01:52:08,694
There is no love or anything in your plans.
I feel like am purposefully wasting money.

1196
01:52:09,903 --> 01:52:15,069
- Please do not stop it midway.
- Are you worried about 54 lakhs? I'll give that too.

1197
01:52:16,361 --> 01:52:21,194
All these days you were going behind Maya.
But now she has come in search of you.

1198
01:52:21,528 --> 01:52:23,819
You are there in her heart.

1199
01:52:24,111 --> 01:52:29,319
We will next make you come
in her dreams for sure.

1200
01:52:34,769 --> 01:52:35,769
OK.

1201
01:52:37,236 --> 01:52:39,028
- Hey hi.
- Hi.

1202
01:52:39,419 --> 01:52:43,044
- How are you? - I am good. How are you?
- Coincidence isn't it?

1203
01:52:51,119 --> 01:52:54,202
When there is a storm, there will rains.

1204
01:52:55,470 --> 01:52:59,095
By saying storm, I meant you.

1205
01:53:00,692 --> 01:53:01,692
Shall we?

1206
01:53:08,611 --> 01:53:09,611
Sorry!

1207
01:53:12,696 --> 01:53:13,696
It's OK.

1208
01:53:17,150 --> 01:53:18,858
Waiting to be awake!

1209
01:53:22,548 --> 01:53:23,548
All the plans devised

1210
01:53:30,903 --> 01:53:31,903
Maya!

1211
01:53:35,410 --> 01:53:36,410
You come here.

1212
01:53:36,986 --> 01:53:37,986
Oh Teacher!

1213
01:53:46,889 --> 01:53:47,889
Hey Santhosh!

1214
01:53:48,028 --> 01:53:50,111
Plans were devised to be flopped

1215
01:53:50,652 --> 01:53:55,318
You jitter me whenever you are around me.

1216
01:53:56,113 --> 01:53:59,238
- Can we go?
- This way please.

1217
01:53:59,878 --> 01:54:04,169
My eyes are weary of the wait
Plans were devised to be flopped

1218
01:54:04,194 --> 01:54:08,194
You jitter me whenever you are around me.

1219
01:54:09,301 --> 01:54:11,801
Let go. Your plans will fumble.

1220
01:54:11,970 --> 01:54:15,470
Let go. Your game will not win here.

1221
01:54:21,236 --> 01:54:22,236
Move.

1222
01:54:50,028 --> 01:54:51,028
You???

1223
01:54:55,403 --> 01:54:59,028
Oh my God. The plan is a flop.

1224
01:54:59,528 --> 01:55:04,819
Let go. Your plans will fumble.
Let go. Your game will not win here.

1225
01:55:11,084 --> 01:55:15,084
- Where is your father?
- We are also waiting for him
- Why uncle?

1226
01:55:16,308 --> 01:55:19,391
- What happened?
- I saw your true colors with my eyes!

1227
01:55:19,985 --> 01:55:23,068
I saw you getting intimate with a girl.
Disgusting!

1228
01:55:24,122 --> 01:55:26,913
Me? What are you saying?

1229
01:55:28,278 --> 01:55:34,069
- Shut up! I have come to ask if we still need to send our girl to this disgraceful family.
- We have also come to ask the same.

1230
01:55:34,736 --> 01:55:38,528
We were asking him if we need to choose
the girl from such a man's family.

1231
01:55:43,736 --> 01:55:45,444
- What is all this?
- Oh my God.

1232
01:55:46,361 --> 01:55:51,861
- What is this? This is not me.
- Then, that was not him!

1233
01:55:53,278 --> 01:55:55,028
I do not trust this uncle.

1234
01:56:01,069 --> 01:56:07,653
I welcome all of you for this historical
success event of the album Idhu Enna Maayam.

1235
01:56:09,954 --> 01:56:15,246
I was told that it is an audio launch. But why is
he talking of a success that history has not seen?

1236
01:56:16,025 --> 01:56:21,442
He is right. He said that it is a
success that history has not seen.

1237
01:56:21,467 --> 01:56:24,592
The success is due to Lalji sir's
music and Maya's divine voice.

1238
01:56:24,957 --> 01:56:34,707
I welcome Mr.Jackie Bruce Chan Lee, the head of JBCL
corporation who will distribute the album in China.

1239
01:56:37,278 --> 01:56:38,278
What name is it?

1240
01:56:39,069 --> 01:56:44,569
The only Chinese names that Bharath
knew was Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee.

1241
01:56:46,153 --> 01:56:47,403
Dudes!

1242
01:56:51,514 --> 01:56:53,639
Greetings dudes!

1243
01:57:02,462 --> 01:57:09,962
I took the first bus from China with a case
of 50 crore to make it for this function.

1244
01:57:13,256 --> 01:57:18,548
Like many famous couples, it is a
pleasure to see Maya and Santhosh.

1245
01:57:18,706 --> 01:57:24,873
- Why is he talking nonsense?
- We asked you to write the script. But you didn't show any interest.

1246
01:57:29,194 --> 01:57:31,194
A small Chinese sentence
has a big meaning.

1247
01:57:35,803 --> 01:57:37,553
Hence this pair..

1248
01:57:41,236 --> 01:57:43,403
.. should unite in real life and...

1249
01:57:44,694 --> 01:57:45,694
... prosper...

1250
01:57:46,736 --> 01:57:48,528
...and grow.

1251
01:57:51,419 --> 01:57:53,836
It's time for lunch.
Shall I open the buffet?

1252
01:58:00,634 --> 01:58:02,717
I pray to God...

1253
01:58:03,778 --> 01:58:04,778
Lunch ready.

1254
01:58:05,861 --> 01:58:06,861
Please come.

1255
01:58:06,931 --> 01:58:10,014
- Lunch is ready it seems. Come.
- Hey! Wait.

1256
01:58:13,944 --> 01:58:16,319
Which idiot asked them
to open the buffet?

1257
01:58:18,028 --> 01:58:20,736
- We had informed that it is without
break and where do you guys go?
 - This is a close up shot for you.

1258
01:58:23,603 --> 01:58:24,603
What happened?

1259
01:58:25,468 --> 01:58:28,460
They are giving our Audio CD's there.

1260
01:58:28,485 --> 01:58:29,485
So this plan is also a flop.

1261
01:58:32,736 --> 01:58:34,736
What is happening here?

1262
01:58:37,653 --> 01:58:40,069
We are raising the expectations.

1263
01:58:41,132 --> 01:58:42,549
Is this your plan?

1264
01:58:43,278 --> 01:58:48,486
- Did you underestimate UMT?
- The audio is a success

1265
01:58:55,278 --> 01:59:00,861
- I don't understand what is happening here.
- Me too.

1266
01:59:02,232 --> 01:59:03,941
I don't understand
what's happening to me.

1267
01:59:05,028 --> 01:59:06,028
What is he doing?

1268
01:59:06,986 --> 01:59:07,986
It's a feeling.

1269
01:59:10,051 --> 01:59:13,342
My heart wants to talk a lot.

1270
01:59:14,819 --> 01:59:15,819
but...

1271
01:59:16,983 --> 01:59:19,483
He seems to talk on his own.

1272
01:59:19,986 --> 01:59:21,569
This was not part of the plan.

1273
01:59:22,569 --> 01:59:24,069
Whenever I see your eyes...

1274
01:59:26,611 --> 01:59:27,611
... I am out of words.

1275
01:59:28,611 --> 01:59:31,028
I am sorry. What do you mean?

1276
01:59:33,850 --> 01:59:34,850
I mean...

1277
01:59:37,778 --> 01:59:38,778
I think..

1278
01:59:42,121 --> 01:59:43,121
No...

1279
01:59:44,434 --> 01:59:45,434
I am sure..

1280
01:59:46,772 --> 01:59:47,772
I am in love.

1281
01:59:53,400 --> 01:59:54,858
I am in love with you.

1282
02:00:03,754 --> 02:00:14,629
Love was once a part of my life.
It is no more in my life.

1283
02:00:19,097 --> 02:00:20,472
I never searched the reason for it.

1284
02:00:22,170 --> 02:00:28,462
But that love did create a
scar in heart and left me!

1285
02:00:32,199 --> 02:00:33,199
After that...

1286
02:00:33,798 --> 02:00:40,756
I do not have the strength to bear
the love nor the pain that it gives.

1287
02:00:46,778 --> 02:00:47,778
I can't Santhosh.

1288
02:00:50,428 --> 02:00:51,928
I have great respect for you.

1289
02:00:53,736 --> 02:00:55,028
You've become my good friend.

1290
02:00:58,712 --> 02:01:06,087
I want this friendship to last a lifetime.
I hope you understand.

1291
02:01:17,071 --> 02:01:18,571
Who asked you to propose?

1292
02:01:19,279 --> 02:01:23,154
Was it part of the script? Why did you seek
us if you wanted to say it on your own?

1293
02:01:25,524 --> 02:01:27,899
- It's all over now.
- All means?

1294
02:01:29,194 --> 02:01:32,653
All the expenses, all
the plans, everything.

1295
02:01:33,319 --> 02:01:36,819
- It's all over. - Arun.
- Can you please stop?

1296
02:01:37,731 --> 02:01:41,939
Why didn't we inquire about this person
in Maya's life? It is your mistake.

1297
02:01:44,111 --> 02:01:46,819
I was wondering why our
plans were flopping.

1298
02:01:51,194 --> 02:01:54,736
What to do? There is
someone else in her heart.

1299
02:01:56,920 --> 02:02:00,462
It's difficult to put
Sathosh in his place.

1300
02:02:01,986 --> 02:02:04,903
Let's stop this
operation with this.

1301
02:02:11,028 --> 02:02:14,819
He is there in her heart
and not in her life.

1302
02:02:17,028 --> 02:02:21,611
What if we take away
that guy from her heart?

1303
02:02:24,486 --> 02:02:25,819
You guys plan well isn't it?

1304
02:02:26,986 --> 02:02:33,778
Find out about that guy and create an impression
that he is a drunkard, rapist or a rogue.

1305
02:02:34,403 --> 02:02:37,194
Then we can easily take
him out of Maya's heart

1306
02:02:37,361 --> 02:02:39,986
After that I can get
inside her heart easily.

1307
02:02:40,569 --> 02:02:42,028
How is the plan?

1308
02:02:42,399 --> 02:02:45,316
Wow. It's an amazing plan.

1309
02:02:45,642 --> 02:02:49,475
- Why don't you join our company?
- This will surely work out. Let's execute it immediately.

1310
02:02:49,861 --> 02:02:53,319
As far as we have inquired about Maya,
she doesn't have any friends in Chennai.

1311
02:02:53,778 --> 02:02:56,653
So may be she might have known some
one in Cochin while she was studying.

1312
02:02:57,665 --> 02:03:02,890
We can easily find out who that guy is
if we inquire the close friends of Maya.

1313
02:03:02,915 --> 02:03:04,939
So let's all go to Cochin.

1314
02:03:16,889 --> 02:03:19,056
- Where are you?
- At home.

1315
02:03:19,347 --> 02:03:22,597
- What happened?
- I am sick. I am lying down.

1316
02:03:22,972 --> 02:03:26,972
- Did you visit the doctor?
- Yes. He advised me to take rest for two days.

1317
02:03:26,997 --> 02:03:29,288
Will it take two days
for you to get back?

1318
02:03:29,931 --> 02:03:30,597
Why?

1319
02:03:30,597 --> 02:03:33,972
We have traced a few
friends of Maya in Cochin.

1320
02:03:34,272 --> 02:03:39,147
Pallavi, Sidharth and Alex. We need
to go to Cochin to meet all of them.

1321
02:03:42,222 --> 02:03:43,222
Fine.

1322
02:03:44,474 --> 02:03:47,057
- I'll be fine in two days.
- Take care of your health.

1323
02:03:49,522 --> 02:03:52,147
Let go. Your tricks
will not work here.

1324
02:03:52,720 --> 02:03:54,720
Let go. Your games
will not work here.

1325
02:04:05,876 --> 02:04:06,876
Who is it?

1326
02:04:08,472 --> 02:04:09,472
My College mate.

1327
02:04:10,057 --> 02:04:11,807
Please come inside.

1328
02:04:13,264 --> 02:04:14,264
My husband.

1329
02:04:16,847 --> 02:04:17,847
Hi

1330
02:04:20,306 --> 02:04:21,181
Tell me.

1331
02:04:21,933 --> 02:04:22,933
Tell me Arun.

1332
02:04:23,932 --> 02:04:24,932
Can you do me a favour?

1333
02:04:25,462 --> 02:04:29,962
You will come along and we should
act as though you are a stranger?

1334
02:04:30,581 --> 02:04:34,373
- I don't understand.
- Please do it for me.

1335
02:04:52,466 --> 02:04:53,466
I am really happy for you.

1336
02:05:05,615 --> 02:05:06,615
Karthik. Come here.

1337
02:05:07,256 --> 02:05:10,173
These are our tickets. Vishnu
and Lavanya are not in town.

1338
02:05:10,889 --> 02:05:13,097
We four along with Santhosh
are going to Cochin.

1339
02:05:13,139 --> 02:05:16,722
7.45 PM Trivandrum mail. Don't miss.
I'll pick you up.

1340
02:05:17,419 --> 02:05:23,627
These are your tickets. Take your ID proof.
I'll see you at the station.

1341
02:05:32,620 --> 02:05:39,037
So as far as you know, Maya was not in
love with anyone in college, is it?

1342
02:05:44,222 --> 02:05:45,222
Isn't it?

1343
02:05:50,424 --> 02:05:53,633
May be Maya does not like you.

1344
02:05:55,123 --> 02:05:58,123
It may be due to this reason that she
said that she loved someone else.

1345
02:06:05,597 --> 02:06:11,889
If Maya's friends don't know about
him then that guy is not in Cochin.

1346
02:06:13,458 --> 02:06:15,041
I know that this
will not work out.

1347
02:06:17,446 --> 02:06:19,696
You were the ones who
wasted time on this.

1348
02:06:21,002 --> 02:06:26,026
We need to spend more to find
the whereabouts of that guy.

1349
02:06:32,056 --> 02:06:35,097
It's better if we
close this project.

1350
02:06:51,514 --> 02:06:52,514
I need to talk to you.

1351
02:06:57,931 --> 02:06:59,264
Didn't you like that girl?

1352
02:07:03,889 --> 02:07:06,347
Do you like some one else?

1353
02:07:14,450 --> 02:07:17,158
Me and your mom loved each
other and we got married.

1354
02:07:18,829 --> 02:07:22,037
We parted due to some situation.

1355
02:07:23,963 --> 02:07:25,255
But our love didn't change.

1356
02:07:27,306 --> 02:07:30,597
Before I could figure out what happened my
dad got me married for the second time.

1357
02:07:32,097 --> 02:07:34,597
From then on I am
leading a fake life.

1358
02:07:36,042 --> 02:07:41,251
I was truly happy only
when I was with your mom.

1359
02:07:44,888 --> 02:07:46,763
You are the symbol
of that happiness.

1360
02:07:49,548 --> 02:07:52,964
That's why she sent you
to me when she expired.

1361
02:07:56,181 --> 02:08:03,681
If you marry another girl after hiding your
love, it will keep pricking you like a thorn.

1362
02:08:05,662 --> 02:08:08,954
If you have someone in
your mind, please tell me.

1363
02:08:10,705 --> 02:08:14,914
Because,  my father didn't understand me...

1364
02:08:17,286 --> 02:08:20,869
... and I don't want to do the same to you.

1365
02:08:36,181 --> 02:08:37,181
The operation is over!

1366
02:08:38,222 --> 02:08:40,639
We have started accepting new clients.

1367
02:08:43,136 --> 02:08:46,011
- Look at that application.
- Santhosh?

1368
02:08:52,438 --> 02:08:56,021
Hey! Arun.. with Maya...

1369
02:09:16,431 --> 02:09:17,431
It's all over

1370
02:09:19,545 --> 02:09:22,837
You drama, cheating and fraudulence..
It all ends today.

1371
02:09:23,868 --> 02:09:27,576
- Do you know Maya?
- Does he know?

1372
02:09:28,064 --> 02:09:30,564
Did you all know that he is the lover
of Maya that we were all searching for?

1373
02:09:32,143 --> 02:09:33,727
What is this?

1374
02:09:34,315 --> 02:09:37,482
We have been very close and you
never told about Maya to us.

1375
02:09:37,688 --> 02:09:40,063
How will he ever say? He wants
that girl and my money.

1376
02:09:40,175 --> 02:09:42,175
Santhosh. Mind your words.

1377
02:09:43,264 --> 02:09:48,847
Why are you getting mad at him? What he said is right,
isn't it? Why did you act as though you didn't know Maya?

1378
02:09:49,284 --> 02:09:53,076
Because, I didn't love her.
I just know her.

1379
02:09:53,472 --> 02:09:57,347
- She is a friend.
- Why didn't you say this when they all went to Cochin?

1380
02:09:57,790 --> 02:09:59,790
Why didn't you tell us when we were
inquiring about Maya's friends?

1381
02:10:00,329 --> 02:10:01,620
Because he loves Maya.

1382
02:10:02,290 --> 02:10:08,790
That's why he was sabotaging all our
plans to make his plans a success.

1383
02:10:09,016 --> 02:10:10,516
And you wanted my
money for that!

1384
02:10:10,932 --> 02:10:15,057
Whatever it is. I am a professional.
I just did my job.

1385
02:10:16,837 --> 02:10:18,712
I cannot be blamed if
she doesn't love you.

1386
02:10:21,003 --> 02:10:22,003
Whatever it is means?

1387
02:10:24,097 --> 02:10:25,097
What do you mean by that?

1388
02:10:29,095 --> 02:10:30,095
So you love Maya.

1389
02:10:32,212 --> 02:10:35,295
Tell what it means. Are
you in love with Maya?

1390
02:10:36,669 --> 02:10:38,980
Whatever it is means that you
are still in love with her?

1391
02:10:39,005 --> 02:10:41,213
Did you take us for granted?

1392
02:10:42,143 --> 02:10:47,143
How much have you cheated us? We
have toiled so much for this!

1393
02:10:55,748 --> 02:10:57,790
Are you cheating your friends and me?

1394
02:11:02,972 --> 02:11:09,264
Give back all the money that I have spent on you. Or else
I will have to inform the cops about your activities.

1395
02:11:09,576 --> 02:11:12,159
Yes. I loved her.
I still love her.

1396
02:11:14,518 --> 02:11:15,518
You want your money isn't it?

1397
02:11:16,628 --> 02:11:17,628
You will get it. Just leave.

1398
02:12:15,206 --> 02:12:16,444
To hear it from you...

1399
02:12:17,487 --> 02:12:18,487
... we aren't the only ones...

1400
02:12:20,495 --> 02:12:22,120
... Maya also is waiting.

1401
02:12:45,347 --> 02:12:46,347
Yes Arun.

1402
02:12:47,126 --> 02:12:49,417
I did fall in love with Maya.

1403
02:12:50,279 --> 02:12:54,779
When I came to know that you are in her
heart, I decided that you must unite.

1404
02:12:58,681 --> 02:13:01,889
Because, it was an accident
that you both got separated.

1405
02:13:02,430 --> 02:13:04,763
It's not both your faults

1406
02:13:05,431 --> 02:13:10,222
She didn't believe when you
lied that you didn't love her.

1407
02:13:11,824 --> 02:13:12,824
Because

1408
02:13:16,519 --> 02:13:17,936
She knew you loved her.

1409
02:13:18,209 --> 02:13:24,292
We can always have some one to talk on our
behalf, but not to express our love.

1410
02:13:25,686 --> 02:13:29,853
Me and Maya decided to get
the truth out from you.

1411
02:13:33,102 --> 02:13:43,893
We inquired about you, found out your friends
and devised this drama named Operation Arun.

1412
02:13:56,431 --> 02:14:00,347
We thought that you would accept the
truth when I first told you about Maya.

1413
02:14:01,347 --> 02:14:06,639
But when you hid this from us, we knew
that she was still in your hearts.

1414
02:14:14,717 --> 02:14:21,717
During every plan, we were
waiting for you to open up.

1415
02:14:29,253 --> 02:14:30,253
Take care of your health.

1416
02:14:38,977 --> 02:14:46,268
Even after knowing that Maya was in your hearts, you
were hiding the truth. So we devised this last plan

1417
02:14:49,556 --> 02:14:53,681
So Operation Arun is a success.

1418
02:14:56,972 --> 02:15:00,472
What are you looking at?
At least go tell her now.

1419
02:15:18,319 --> 02:15:19,319
Maya

1420
02:15:23,728 --> 02:15:24,728
Enough

1421
02:15:27,188 --> 02:15:28,771
You finally accepted that you love me.

1422
02:15:31,464 --> 02:15:32,464
That is enough.

1423
02:15:34,672 --> 02:15:35,672
I don't want to know anything else.

1424
02:15:47,213 --> 02:15:50,621
Maya... She is magic.

1425
02:15:52,399 --> 02:15:54,190
Don't miss her again
in your life.

1426
02:16:12,255 --> 02:16:14,547
Maya just a moment.
Just a moment please.

1427
02:16:16,873 --> 02:16:17,873
Just a moment.

1428
02:16:20,831 --> 02:16:23,665
What are you going to say?

1429
02:16:24,412 --> 02:16:25,412
Such beautiful eyes.

1430
02:16:31,846 --> 02:16:33,339
You have a wonderful smile

1431
02:16:36,806 --> 02:16:37,806
Such nice hair

1432
02:16:41,201 --> 02:16:44,493
You will never get a better guy than me.

1433
02:16:49,417 --> 02:16:50,417
I loved you Maya.

1434
02:16:53,097 --> 02:16:54,097
I love you.

1435
02:16:56,310 --> 02:16:57,310
I will love you forever.
