1
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:37,600
"What is life? Nobody knows."

2
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:44,800
"What is life? Nobody knows."

3
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,600
"Whoever knows it, repents."

4
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,000
"Whoever knows it, repents."

5
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,600
"Whoever knows it, repents."

6
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,200
"What is life?"

7
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,200
"What is life? Nobody knows."

8
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,200
Hello! Aditya here.

9
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,600
Be ready,
I'm coming to pick you up.

10
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,600
I love you.

11
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,000
Surprise!
- When did you come?

12
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,600
An hour ago.

13
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,400
I love you.

14
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,400
You were going to come next week.

15
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,400
Yes, but Calcutta was very hot,
so I cut my trip short.

16
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,000
Stupid, I missed you so much.

17
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,800
You didn't even call me.

18
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,600
How is your mom?
- She's fine, but ask how I am.

19
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,400
How are you?
- I'm fine.

20
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,200
But you look disappointed to see me.
- Why?

21
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,400
Are you having an affair
in the office with some girl?

22
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,200
I have to attend an office party.
- Party?

23
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,600
No, you cannot go to the party.

24
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,200
You don't understand.
My Boss will get angry.

25
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,800
Even I'll come with you.

26
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,200
You come after half an hour.

27
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,400
Alright, but there is
a whole hour to 8 O'clock.

28
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,800
Isn't it

29
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,600
Tell me where's Vilas?
Come on, tell me.

30
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,800
Why are you messing up with me?
Tell me.

31
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,800
Tell me where's Vilas?
Do you want to get thrashed like this?

32
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,200
Hey, you'll die.
Tell us where is Vilas?

33
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:51,000
Don't waste my time.
Tell me where Vilas is. Tell me!

34
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,800
Where is Vilas?

35
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,400
He just keeps staring like a fool.
Tell us!

36
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,000
Tell us.

37
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,800
Come on, tell us.

38
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,000
Tell us!

39
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,400
This is our locality. It's our area!

40
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,200
It's our lane and you want to bully us?

41
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,200
Is this right? Tell me!

42
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Hey don't beat him.
He's badly hurt.

43
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,200
Tell us. Tell us.

44
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,800
Tell us. Tell us.

45
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,200
Tell us!

46
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,800
Tell us!

47
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,600
Tell us!

48
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,400
Tell me.
- I don't know where Vilas is.

49
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,400
If I knew, I'd tell you.

50
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,000
You take us to be fools?

51
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,200
You think you are very smart
to have come alone in our area?

52
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,800
What are you all doing?
Inquiring like the police?

53
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Why is he still alive?
- To know what's on his mind.

54
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,600
Forget what's on his mind!
Make him speak!

55
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,800
If anything happens to me,
Prafulbhai will not spare you.

56
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,800
He will burn
down your whole area.

57
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Shut-up!
- Why are you beating me!

58
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,600
You threaten me with Prafulbhai's name?

59
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,600
You are threatening Ramanbhai?

60
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,200
Prafulbhai will not spare you!

61
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,400
Make him shut up.
He's gone nuts.

62
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,800
Patankar has come.

63
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,000
Have you gone nuts?

64
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:26,000
Will you shut up?
- Prafulbhai will not spare you.

65
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,600
Do you want to live or not?
Make him shut up!

66
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,400
I'd told you to shut up!

67
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,800
Patankar has come.

68
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,600
Is it confirmed news?
- He's your man, you know better.

69
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,000
That's the word on the street.

70
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,000
How much has he betrayed me for?

71
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,400
I've heard, for a million.

72
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,000
One million?

73
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,000
Where is he right now?
- Hotel Sea View.

74
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,200
Room 14.

75
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,000
Hurry up, we are getting late.

76
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,600
You go ahead, I'll follow.

77
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,400
Scared to come along?

78
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:25,000
He's sweating. Scared, are you?

79
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,400
My new shoe is biting me.

80
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,200
It's not fear,
it's something else.

81
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,200
Why, you are an old hand.

82
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,400
It's not the first time
you are killing a friend.

83
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,000
Vilas is our friend.

84
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,000
Until yesterday, he was in our gang
killing people with us.

85
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,400
Today, we are going to kill him.
Naturally, I am tense.

86
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,200
Do one thing, you stay here.

87
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,800
That means, if I go against the gang
even I'll meet the same fate?

88
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,400
Don't talk like kids.
You know the answer. Let's go.

89
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,600
My boy, you don't have
that killer instinct.

90
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,000
Why do you say that, sir?
- You look very nervous.

91
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,200
What is the matter?
- Nothing, sir.

92
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,600
No? Your wife will come from here...

93
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,800
...and over there, Malvika will sing.

94
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,800
You misunderstand, sir.
I have no such relationship with her.

95
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,800
Is it?

96
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Couldn't you have waited for me?
- "You be quiet."

97
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,000
"You be quiet, I'll be quiet."

98
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:47,200
"Let our silences carry out
a conversation."

99
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:56,600
"Let our lives carry out
a conversation."

100
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:03,600
"You be quiet, I'll be quiet."

101
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:08,400
"You be quiet, I'll be quiet."

102
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,800
"Let our silences carry out
a conversation."

103
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:22,200
"Let our lives carry out
a conversation."

104
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:30,200
"You be quiet, I'll be quiet.

105
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,600
"You be quiet."

106
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:06,000
"Let's drown in each other's eyes.
Let the hands converse."

107
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:16,800
"Let's drown in each other's eyes.
Let the hands converse."

108
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:27,400
"Holding you in my arms,
this night will pass like a wind."

109
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
"Let our fingers carry out
a conversation."

110
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:42,400
"Let seasons converse
with the blossoms."

111
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:49,400
"You be quiet, I'll be quiet.

112
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,600
You be quiet."

113
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:36,000
"Let our lips meet
and produce wordless melodies."

114
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:46,400
"Let our lips meet
and produce wordless melodies."

115
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:57,200
"The melody of our love will echo
from the earth to the sky."

116
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:03,000
"Let our passion carry out
a conversation."

117
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:11,800
"Let our love carry out
a conversation."

118
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:19,200
"You be quiet, I'll be quiet."

119
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,400
You be quiet, I'll be quiet."

120
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:29,800
"You be quiet, I'll...
- Be quiet."

121
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,800
"You be quiet."

122
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,200
This is Vilasbhai here.

123
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,200
I told you to shift me to another room.

124
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,000
So what happened?

125
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,800
Alright, do one thing.
Send someone else here.

126
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,600
And shift me to his room.
You understand?

127
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:58,400
If anyone asks for me,
don't tell him I am here.

128
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,200
I am not here! You understand?

129
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,600
Why are you so worried?
No one knows you are here.

130
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,600
Sit down.

131
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,200
Marathe, what happened about my ticket?

132
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,200
You cannot arrange two tickets?

133
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,200
If you cannot arrange plane tickets,
arrange train tickets for me. Hurry!

134
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,600
Look, if Ramanbhai comes,
speak calmly with him.

135
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,400
Explain to him that
Prafulbhai trapped you.

136
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,600
Oh yes! As if I will explain
and Raman will believe me.

137
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,200
Raman refuses
to understand anything.

138
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,800
Boss.

139
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,000
You all stay here.

140
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,400
Boss, don't go in alone.

141
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,800
Boss asked you all to stay out.

142
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,400
Vilas...

143
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,400
So the news was right.

144
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,200
I'd heard the right news.

145
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,400
You took one million.

146
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,000
You took one million rupees
to kill Ramanbhai.

147
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,800
The news was true.

148
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,400
The news was true.

149
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:21,400
Raman, don't move, I'll shoot!

150
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,400
I swear I'll shoot!

151
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,600
Go ahead, shoot!

152
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,000
Look Raman.
- Shoot your Ramanbhai!

153
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,200
Kill the Ramanbhai...

154
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,600
...who went after your brother's killer
to Calcutta and killed him.

155
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,000
Kill him, because you forget all
that for rupees one million.

156
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,400
It is you who has forgotten Raman,
not me.

157
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,000
You've forgotten those days
when we together looted rich Merchants.

158
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,000
I always considered you my brother.
Always!

159
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And you think I have betrayed you?

160
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,800
Hey, don't come out!

161
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,200
Of course you have betrayed me.
Vilas, I saw your photo!

162
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,600
You were drinking
with Praful Kalia.

163
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,800
Does that mean
I have joined hands with him?

164
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,000
Shobha!

165
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,000
Sister-in-law, lock yourself in.

166
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,800
I think we will have to go in.

167
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,600
Ramanbhai is taking very long.

168
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,400
Since you were not even born...

169
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,800
...Ramanbhai has been doing
this several times.

170
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,200
So don't try to act like a stooge.

171
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,200
Hey, who are you calling a stooge?

172
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,800
Did you call me a stooge?

173
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,000
You called Iqbal a stooge?
- No.

174
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,400
Then he must have called you one.

175
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,400
Ratna, open the door.

176
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,600
Ratna, go out.

177
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,800
Got the time to come finally?

178
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,800
You are excellent!
- Oh, really.

179
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,600
Thank you.

180
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,600
Angry?
- No.

181
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:28,200
I had come to say
that if you like, tonight...

182
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,200
At night?

183
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,600
You don't have the guts to
congratulate me in others presence.

184
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,800
And at night...
- Even Pooja was present there.

185
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,400
How can I speak to you in her presence?

186
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,400
How long will you hide it from her?

187
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,600
She will know some day.
- You don't worry about that.

188
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,000
You will come at night?

189
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,600
What will you tell Pooja?

190
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,000
I love you.

191
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,600
The door is open.

192
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,000
The door...

193
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,400
The door is open.

194
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,600
Malvika...

195
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,000
You! What the devil
are you doing over here?

196
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,600
I had just come to congratulate her.

197
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,800
That was quite congratulation.

198
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,600
And your wife is waiting outside
for you.

199
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,400
Keep the gun inside, moron!
- Don't you dare!

200
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,800
I'll call Praful Kalia.

201
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Just listen, don't speak.

202
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,800
Pick up the phone.

203
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,600
Hello. Praful Kalia here.

204
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,200
You rogue! You want to trap me?

205
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,200
You want to get me killed
at Raman's hands?

206
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,800
Now listen, Raman is dead.

207
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,200
Now it's your turn.

208
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,400
Vilas, I did you a favor by giving
you an excuse to kill Raman.

209
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,000
Now you're the boss of that area
and we can work together now.

210
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,000
You are right, you swine!

211
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,600
Did you understand now?

212
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,000
Did you understand now?

213
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,400
He's going to shoot Boss!

214
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,000
Irfan!

215
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I'd warned you not to come in! What?

216
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,400
Boss, what have you done?

217
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,000
What have you done!

218
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,600
What have you done!

219
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,600
What have you done!
- Vilas!

220
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,000
What have you done!

221
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,400
Nothing will happen to her.

222
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,200
What have you done!

223
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,600
Call an ambulance!

224
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,600
Listen, tell the manager that...

225
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,000
Listen to me, Vilas.

226
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Listen to me, Vilas.
- Move!

227
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,600
Vilas!

228
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Hit him! Hit him!

229
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,400
Aditya is a rogue
and if you have even a little sense...

230
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,200
...you won't let him come near you.

231
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,200
Are you listening or not?
- No.

232
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,600
You really are a fool.

233
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,800
He is a married man.
He is fooling you.

234
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,200
And I am knowingly being fooled.

235
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,200
Why do you bother?
You mind your own business.

236
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,200
Don't come crying to me later
when he goes back to Pooja.

237
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,000
Alright, I won't.

238
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,400
You really are mad.
His love has made you go crazy.

239
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,400
Yes, it has,
it's made us both crazy.

240
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
You are nuts.

241
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,600
Listen.

242
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,200
Please.

243
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,200
You'll get the money.
Just manage things.

244
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,400
The ambulance has come.
- Is it here?

245
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,400
Boss, the ambulance has come.

246
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,800
Shankar.

247
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,400
Lock Vilas in the godown.

248
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,000
He's gone berserk...

249
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,800
...he'll kill anyone.

250
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,800
Ask Iqbal to take her
to Deshpande's clinic.

251
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,200
And ask him to certify
death by heart attack.

252
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,200
Heart attack, get that!

253
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,800
A certificate of heart attack.

254
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,200
I don't want any more trouble.

255
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,400
Meet me tomorrow morning.

256
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,200
You idiot!

257
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I'd said he'll get us
in trouble one day.

258
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,400
Pooja, we were talking about you.

259
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
What is the matter?
You look upset.

260
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,000
I wanted you to meet him.

261
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,800
"What is life? Nobody knows."

262
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:58,400
"What is life? Nobody knows."

263
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,000
"Whoever knows it, repents."

264
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,200
"Whoever knows it, repents."

265
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,800
"Whoever knows it, repents."

266
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:17,400
"What is life?"

267
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:25,600
"What is life? Nobody knows."

268
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:06,400
What are you doing!
Pooja, at least listen to me!

269
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,600
Please! I want to talk to you.

270
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,200
Shut-up.
Just shut-up.

271
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:47,200
Has someone said something to you?

272
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,800
I'm sure someone
has said something.

273
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,200
Go out.

274
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,400
Why?
- I want to change.

275
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,600
Then change.

276
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,200
You slapped me in the party.

277
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,400
Someone said something
and you believed it?

278
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,400
Believe me too.

279
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,400
I'm sure Patel must
have told you that I...

280
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,800
Pooja, my job is such.

281
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,600
I have to meet people.
I have to meet girls.

282
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,200
I have to entertain them.
- In the bathroom.

283
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,000
What nonsense are you talking!
Have you gone mad?

284
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,600
Pooja.

285
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,200
Pooja, tell me what you heard.
- Go and ask Malvika.

286
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,000
Oh, the green room incident.

287
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,400
So you meet her in the
Green room, not the bathroom.

288
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,600
I am not saying I don't know her.

289
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,800
Believe me.

290
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,200
I met her the first time when...
- Stop it.

291
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,200
You don't have to give me
any explanations.

292
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,200
I don't want to know...

293
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,600
...where you meet her,
when you meet her...

294
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,200
...how many times you meet her.
Once, or twice a week.

295
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,200
Do me a favor.
Please just get out.

296
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,600
It's her call, isn't it?
- Pooja.

297
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,000
It was her call? Don't touch me.
- It wasn't her call.

298
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,400
Just get out of the house.
- Listen to me.

299
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,400
Listen to me.
- Just leave...

300
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,600
...or I'll jump from the window!

301
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,000
What nonsense are you talking!
- Just get out of my house!

302
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,600
This is my house too.
- Then you live here.

303
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,200
Leave me!
I don't want to live here!

304
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,800
Why don't you call her?

305
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,400
I don't want to live here.
- Shut up!

306
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,600
Only then can we talk.

307
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:44,600
Pooja, even I am human.
Even I can make a mistake.

308
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,200
Pooja, after all we are.

309
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,400
Malvika... What do I say?

310
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:58,400
- Pooja!
- Mr. Aditya, what is this chaos about?

311
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,800
Pooja.
- These are Mumbai walls.

312
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,800
They tremble even with a scream.

313
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,800
Husband and wife fights
are common in every home.

314
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,400
Pooja, please!
- But no one creates a scene like this.

315
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,400
Look, I don't want to interfere...

316
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,000
Who are you?
- Who am I?

317
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,200
Get lost!

318
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Pooja, please!

319
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,200
I will complain
in the building society's office.

320
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,400
Pooja, open the door!

321
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,000
Boss, it says this number
does not exist.

322
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,200
What number did you dial?

323
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Switch off the TV.

324
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,000
Switch off the TV!
Where is Chota?

325
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,600
Chota!

326
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Chota!

327
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,600
Go, Boss is calling you.
You stooge!

328
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:13,000
Who did you call a stooge?
I respect Boss.

329
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,200
If anyone else had said that,
I'd have slapped him hard!

330
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,600
But I cannot slap you.

331
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,200
Why? What do I mean to you?

332
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,600
You are my girlfriend.

333
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,000
You don't have the guts
to say that to Boss.

334
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,000
I will even tell Boss one day.

335
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,400
Better do it fast,
There are many others in line.

336
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,600
You shameless!

337
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,400
Who is it?
- Chotu.

338
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,800
Go, my brother is calling you.

339
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,200
I'll meet you later.

340
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,000
You called me, Boss?

341
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,200
Where were you?
- I...

342
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,600
Dial the godown number.
I can't get it.

343
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,200
Father, someone will go deaf here.

344
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,400
If anyone will go deaf in the house,
it will be me.

345
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,200
You have any problem?

346
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,600
Yes, the prayers are
being offered there, the TV is on here.

347
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,000
Do any one thing.

348
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,600
The TV is on for me.

349
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,600
And the prayers are being offered
for your mom who's dead.

350
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:34,400
Yes, Boss is here. Patankar's call.
- Hold.

351
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:39,200
Tell him, I'm going nuts.
- I'll try he's right.

352
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,800
He wants to meet you.
- Call him here.

353
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,000
Tell him I'll meet him at Shetty's bar.

354
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,800
Get my shoes. Sit down.

355
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:53,400
Patankar, Boss has asked you
to come to Shetty's shop.

356
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
When did you come?

357
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,200
Today evening.

358
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,200
Has he started some business?

359
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,400
You'd told him you'll help him
start a petrol pump.

360
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,000
He has got into to habit
of living off me.

361
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,600
Look, I gave you a home to live.

362
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:25,200
Your rations, your monthly expenses,
I provide everything.

363
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,800
Ask him to take a taxi permit
and drive a taxi.

364
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,800
You will like it
if your sister's husband drives a taxi?

365
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,000
Why?

366
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,000
Why will I mind?

367
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,400
I don't mind when my father
keeps screaming at me all day.

368
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Then why will I mind
if your husband drives a taxi?

369
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,200
Explain to him that he should
live off his own hard work...

370
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,200
...not live off others.

371
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,800
Chota, let's go.

372
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,400
"Hey, Sir!"

373
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,600
"Hey, Sir! Hello, Sir! Sway and dance.
Forget all your worries."

374
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,400
"Forget them!"

375
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:30,200
"Break the walls which keep you
and me apart."

376
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,800
"Break them."

377
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,600
"All these sticks,
bullets and fighting!"

378
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,000
"To hell with all of it!"

379
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,200
"All these sticks,
bullets and fighting!"

380
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,200
"To hell with all of it!"

381
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,400
"Give love and win hearts,
why create differences?"

382
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:52,200
"Hey, Sir! Hello, Sir! Sway and dance.
Forget all your worries."

383
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,400
"Forget them!"

384
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,400
Hello.
- Wrong number.

385
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,200
Chota, try the godown.

386
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,800
Tell Tony we are coming.

387
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,000
Is that Sajid with Ramesh?
- Yes.

388
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,200
Is he related to Kaderbhai?
- Yes.

389
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:40,400
"Life is like clay,
you can shape it as you like."

390
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:46,200
"You can shape it into a mirror,
or you could shape it into a toy."

391
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:51,800
"Don't fight, don't quarrel.
A girl will love a boy."

392
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:57,200
"As long as you and I exist,
youth will be celebrated."

393
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,800
"Why create a scene?
Let our hearts unite."

394
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,600
Say it's Ramanbhai's call.

395
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Okay.

396
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,200
Dr. Deshpande is not available.

397
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,000
A girl answered, said she
doesn't know where he is.

398
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,400
Pooja, please don't disconnect.

399
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,400
Give me a chance to explain.

400
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:26,200
I said I tried. All lines are busy.
- Try again.

401
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,400
Come on, try again.

402
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,600
Hello.

403
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,800
Pooja, please don't disconnect.

404
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,200
I said I don't want to talk to you.

405
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,400
I am coming home.
- I'm going out.

406
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,600
Where?
- You don't have to worry.

407
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,400
I am not alone.
- Who is with you?

408
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,000
None of your business.
- Pooja, I'm coming home.

409
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I love you.

410
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,600
Hey! Take your Romeo-Juliet talk
somewhere else.

411
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,800
Look, I want to make a call.
Please!

412
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,400
Don't give me that fine language.

413
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,000
Move! Hey!
- "Swing and dance."

414
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,400
"Forget all your worries. Forget them!"

415
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:37,200
"Break the walls which keep you
and me apart."

416
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,400
"Break, them."
- How many times did I tell you...

417
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,400
I am making a call
and he is disturbing me.

418
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,000
He's a strange man.
Who are you people?

419
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,800
What happened?

420
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,600
What happened?

421
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,000
What happened, Boss?

422
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,800
Tell me what happened!

423
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,800
What kind of bullying is going on?

424
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,800
What did he do, Boss?
Who are you?

425
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:07,400
Get the car out soon.
What are you doing!

426
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,600
What? - Who are you messing with?
- I'm not messing with anyone.

427
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:14,000
The one you are messing
with is Ramanbhai!

428
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,600
So what if he is Ramanbhai?
- Don't you read the papers?

429
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,200
He's 'The' Raman!

430
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,600
Slip away!

431
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,000
Get him, Boss!

432
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,000
Run away!

433
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,200
Run away!

434
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,400
Catch him!

435
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,400
Hey wait, you!

436
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,200
Hurry up.

437
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
No one will leave this place!

438
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,000
Boss, bye.

439
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,400
Boss, we will have to kill that hero.

440
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,200
Or we'll become a laughing stock.

441
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,600
No one will leave this place!

442
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,400
No one!

443
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,000
No one!

444
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,800
Ganya, come here! Look!

445
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,400
Hey, catch him!

446
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,800
Hey, catch him! Ganya!

447
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,200
Hey, catch him!

448
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,400
I'll check behind,
You go ahead and check.

449
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,800
Okay, I'll do it.
- Alright.

450
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,200
He's not here either.

451
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,800
Where did he go?

452
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,800
Where did he go?
- He's not here either.

453
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,600
Did you see a guy with long hair?

454
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,400
Have you seen him?
- A longhaired fellow.

455
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,000
Where did he go?
- Just keep smoking, you idiots!

456
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,600
Where did he go?
- Where did he go?

457
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,200
Where did he go?

458
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,400
Look, you'll inform the boss.

459
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,800
No, no, you'll tell him.
- Why these shoes?

460
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,200
Throw those shoes!
- They are new.

461
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,800
You're carrying them in hands.

462
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,000
Listen, Tony!

463
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,200
Vilas, what are you doing?

464
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,600
Look, you won't be able to escape...

465
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,000
...and I'll unnecessarily have to shoot.
- You'll shoot me?

466
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,000
You'll fire at Vilas?

467
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:00,200
You have become Raman's dog.
Go and lick his feet!

468
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:06,000
If you have any goodness left in you,
release me!

469
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,600
I cannot release you.

470
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:13,400
Who brought you in this gang?
Who?

471
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,400
Tell me who had brought you?

472
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,200
I understand Vilas,
but even I am doing a job.

473
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:25,400
You used to visit my house,
and tell me to marry Shobha.

474
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,800
When she died, you didn't shed a tear,
you didn't say a word.

475
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,600
You're misunderstanding.
You say Shobha is dead.

476
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,600
But Shobha is not dead.
Iqbal has taken her to the hospital.

477
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:41,400
Look, I beg of you, release me.

478
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,200
Release me, you thug!

479
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,600
I cannot release you.

480
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,400
If I do, Raman will kill me.

481
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,400
I don't know
what Raman will do with you...

482
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,200
...but I won't spare him!

483
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,200
Tony! Hey Tony!

484
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,400
Careful.
- Sorry. Excuse me, sorry.

485
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,000
You took so long.
- Hurry up!

486
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,400
Come on, take it out quickly.

487
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,400
Manage this case.
- Don't worry.

488
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,000
Don't worry at all. We are there.

489
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:25,200
Take her.
- I'll arrange things.

490
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,600
Boss has asked to certify
death by heart attack.

491
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,400
I cannot do just anything.

492
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,600
Whether by accident or heart attack,
why do you bother?

493
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,800
Go and sit there.
- But Boss wants it that way.

494
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,800
Hello?

495
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,200
Tony.
- Yes, Iqbal?

496
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,200
Tell Boss Shobha's death certificate
will be arranged.

497
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,600
What!
- She had died in the hotel itself.

498
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:55,600
Tony, what happened?
Tell me what happened.

499
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,200
Tell me what happened.

500
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,800
Yes, tell me.

501
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,600
Why are you quiet? Tell me!

502
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,000
Whose call was that?
Has something happened?

503
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:12,200
Where are you going? Listen to me!

504
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,800
Tony!

505
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,600
Tony, tell me what happened.
Tell me!

506
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,400
Tony, tell me what happened.
Tell me!

507
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:29,400
Take this, and leave.

508
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,800
But what has happened?

509
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,200
I said take this and leave!
- But what has happened?

510
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,200
Why don't you understand?
She has died in the hospital.

511
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,600
Go! Just go!

512
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:47,400
Tony, don't worry.
I will not spare Raman now.

513
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,400
Don't worry at all...

514
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:56,800
...nothing will happen to you.
Nothing will happen to you!

515
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,600
Please answer the phone.

516
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:17,600
Rajesh, Aditya here.

517
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:21,800
I am in trouble.
- I know Malvika is here.

518
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:25,200
Oh no! I'll handle her...

519
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:29,000
...you just come here immediately.
- I don't understand.

520
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,600
You won't understand over
the phone even if I explain.

521
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,400
Just come, please!

522
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,200
This is too much!

523
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,600
If you have a problem, you come here.

524
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,800
You can't expect me
to come so late.

525
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:47,600
Rajesh, please help me.

526
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,200
Look...
- I am in deep trouble.

527
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:54,800
These people will kill me,
they have weapons.

528
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,400
Just come!
- Tell me where.

529
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:05,000
If Shetty doesn't come within minutes,
I'll break your bar!

530
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:08,400
I called his residence.
He has left, he'll be here any minute.

531
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,200
If any of you know
where that guy lives, tell me!

532
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,600
Or I'll make you all
stay here all night.

533
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,600
Greetings, Boss.
- Greetings, Boss.

534
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,800
Kaderbhai has called
a meeting of all dons.

535
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,400
Kaderbhai has said Praful...
- Did I ask you to sit?

536
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,400
He has asked you to keep
your boys in check...

537
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,000
...or suffer the consequences.

538
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:01,200
I didn't say it,
Kaderbhai has said it.

539
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,600
Boss, leave him!
- Leave me.

540
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,800
He will do whatever I'll tell him do?

541
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,200
We could not find him, Boss.

542
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,800
But we'll find him, Boss.
- We'll find him.

543
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
We'll find him.

544
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,200
Where is he?

545
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,800
Where is Shetty?

546
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,400
I want Shetty! You get that?

547
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,000
I want Shetty!

548
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,200
Rajesh, stop!

549
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:02,600
Everything seems okay to me.

550
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,200
Rajesh, listen to me!
Let's get out of here!

551
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,000
Just a minute.
She wants to talk to you in private.

552
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,200
I don't want to talk to anyone.
Let's just get out of here.

553
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,200
Malvika!
- Stop her!

554
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,800
Malvika, please.

555
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:25,600
I am sorry.

556
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:28,800
I am really sorry.

557
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,400
I know you are angry with me.

558
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
But I am in deep trouble.

559
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,400
Get in the car,
I'll explain everything.

560
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:50,600
Please.

561
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,800
I don't understand
why we have come here.

562
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,400
I used to come often to this bar.

563
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,600
I have told Shetty many
personal things about myself.

564
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:17,800
Oh no.

565
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,800
These people are still here.

566
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,800
Please drop me off here.
- How can you!

567
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,000
How can you even think of leaving me?

568
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,400
Because you are a rascal.
- I am sorry. I said I am sorry.

569
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Why did you...

570
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:38,000
I have apologized.
- That doesn't mean I've forgiven you.

571
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,400
Will you two stop fighting!
Some people are coming out.

572
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,200
Go.

573
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,200
Follow them!
- You want us dead?

574
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,600
You should ask me to drive opposite.
- All right.

575
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,600
What if he has come
to know my address?

576
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,600
I'll call you.

577
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,200
Drop me home.

578
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,600
Please, Malvika.
Follow them.

579
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:18,800
Keep a distance.

580
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,800
Keep a distance,
don't go too close.

581
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I'm trying my best.
You come and drive.

582
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,000
Why did I go to that bar at all!

583
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,600
Yes, why did you? You were
supposed to come and meet me.

584
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,800
There must have been a reason.
- You always have an excuse.

585
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,800
You treat me as if
I'm your mistress.

586
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,400
What nonsense!
Have you gone mad?

587
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:47,200
I'm always the last thing on your list.

588
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,400
And that too if I'm lucky.

589
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,400
I am suppose to keep waiting for you.

590
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,600
How could I've met you tonight?

591
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,400
Pooja has come to know about us.

592
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,800
I wonder who told her.
Maybe you did.

593
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,200
You just say anything anywhere.

594
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:06,600
Stop it! Rajesh, Stop the car!

595
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,000
Adi, what are you doing!
We'll lose their car.

596
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,600
I am sorry. Really I am sorry.

597
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,200
Explain to her.
- You explain to her.

598
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:17,800
I'm driving.

599
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:23,000
Sorry, I didn't mean to say that,
it just came out.

600
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,800
I either drive or listen to you two,
I cannot do both together.

601
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,800
Hey, we've been here before.

602
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,600
This is the same place
I'd brought you the other day.

603
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,600
When there was a party in your boss,
Patel's house.

604
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,400
They are going to Patel's house!

605
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:37,800
Turn the car!

606
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,400
Where are you taking this?
- Inside, why?

607
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,600
As if you are going to read inside.
- Don't shout.

608
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:00,400
This is the house, Boss.

609
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,600
Guys, look! This is Patel special.

610
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:13,400
Shammi kabab!
As we say in advertising.

611
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:16,800
Tasty and nutritious!

612
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:23,400
Don't worry, I'll get it.
Who are you?

613
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,400
Keep the gun away.

614
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,200
Patel?

615
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:48,600
Yes.

616
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,800
In your company...

617
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,800
What's his name?
- Aditya.

618
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,600
Some Aditya works in your company?

619
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:04,000
Does Aditya work in your company or not?
- Yes.

620
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,200
What's his address?
- Who are you people?

621
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,400
You want to know?

622
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,400
The whole market is closed.

623
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,200
Should they have kept it
open for us?

624
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,200
We must call Patel
before they reach him.

625
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:30,400
I say everybody,
meet my friends. Come.

626
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,800
Come, come.

627
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:37,200
Darling just look after my friends.
Take care of them.

628
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,600
Everybody have a nice time.
Have enjoy yourself.

629
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:43,800
Shankar Come with me.
- Ganesh, go with him.

630
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,200
Would you like to have a drink?

631
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,000
Please change the music
and have some Pink Floyd.

632
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,600
If he doesn't give it,
I'll kill him.

633
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,600
Hey, don't get too excited.

634
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Great, isn't it? Their life, Boss.

635
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Ramanbhai, however hard we try...

636
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:30,200
...but this style, this respect...

637
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,400
...is not in our destiny.

638
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
What to say?

639
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,400
You keep such cheap things at home!

640
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,200
You have such a rotten trolley
in such a beautiful house.

641
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:48,000
He just pushed a little
and it fell down.

642
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,400
Why are you staring now?
Pick this up.

643
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,400
Sit down all of you.

644
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Sit down. Sit down.

645
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,800
Sit down, madam.

646
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,400
Sit.

647
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,200
A lot of people work in my company.

648
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,600
It is not necessary that
I have everyone's address.

649
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,000
Look, Chote has not killed anyone.

650
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,200
One slash and you
will remember everything.

651
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,200
Will you give the address
or do I tell him to go ahead?

652
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,000
He's a young guy,
he can do anything.

653
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,200
Drive fast!

654
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,600
The Irani cafe
to the right will be open.

655
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:49,800
Drive fast!

656
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,000
The knife did the job.

657
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:57,000
How did you remember now?
- It was written in my old diary.

658
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:03,200
What does QQ stand for?

659
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,000
It's the initials of my name.

660
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:09,200
Good day.

661
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:12,600
Qasim Qayyum Patel.
Sounds powerful.

662
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,400
Listen.
- What is it?

663
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,600
If you find Aditya,
what will you do with him?

664
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:23,000
It depends on Boss's mood,
but I think he's going to die.

665
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:32,600
Stop! I'll call Patel.
- Get down.

666
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:53,200
Aditya here, sir.
Some goons are after me.

667
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,200
If they come to you...
- You're fired!

668
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,200
Don't you dare come to office tomorrow!

669
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:01,400
I never knew the kind
of company you keep.

670
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,000
Do you know what they did to me?
Hello.

671
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,400
You told them?
- I told them everything!

672
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:10,800
I told them about your mother,
father, grandfather, everybody!

673
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,600
They told me that
they are going to kill you.

674
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:16,800
Oh no.

675
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:23,400
Hello. Pooja, Aditya here.

676
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,400
Pooja!
- Wrong number.

677
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:27,600
Listen to me!
- Shall we go?

678
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,400
Let me finish my drink.

679
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,200
Come what may,
don't open the door.

680
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:32,800
Pooja, listen!

681
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,800
Oh, no!

682
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Patel told them everything.
- Get in.

683
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,800
Hurry, Pooja is alone at home.

684
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,400
Why are you staring? Go away!

685
00:56:54,800 --> 00:57:03,400
"The soil smiles
and spreads fragrance through flowers."

686
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:11,800
"The soil smiles
and spreads fragrance through flowers."

687
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:24,200
"It's the soil that turns into the iron
of a sword and sheds blood."

688
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:40,000
"The same soil changes forms
in you and me."

689
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:44,000
"Whoever knows it, repents."

690
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:50,600
"What is life? Nobody knows."

691
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:04,800
Lost your wife?

692
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,200
Even I lost my wife.

693
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,200
She died of burns.

694
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,600
I didn't burn her.

695
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,400
She left behind a suicide note.

696
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,000
'I am the only one responsible
for my death'.

697
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:43,800
She looked quite young.

698
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,200
Did she meet with an accident?

699
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:58,000
Then? Someone killed her?

700
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,000
She was shot dead.

701
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:16,400
Come, I'll drop you in my car.

702
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:20,600
You'll feel better
once you are out of here. Come.

703
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:31,800
"Lord Shiva says, listen to me,
friend, don't leave now."

704
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:36,600
"Who cares if he is a king?"

705
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:38,800
Pooja.

706
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,800
Pooja, where are you?

707
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:50,000
Pooja.

708
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:57,000
Wait a minute Malvika.

709
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:58,800
Where are you going?
- I am going to house.

710
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,400
How can you go alone
so late in the night?

711
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:03,000
Get in the car, I'll drop you.
- Have you gone mad?

712
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,600
Aditya has gone up to get Pooja.
- So what?

713
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,600
He will go, her life is in danger.

714
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:09,200
She is his wife after all.
- And who am I?

715
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:12,200
You well not his wife.

716
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,800
Exactly! I am not his wife.

717
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,600
She will come here any minute.

718
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:20,400
I don't want to create
another scene here.

719
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:23,400
Please let me go. I'll take a cab.
- O God!

720
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:27,000
I don't think you can go now.
Get in the car.

721
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:33,200
Open the gate.
- Where have you come from?

722
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:35,400
What do you want?
- I want to meet Mr. Aditya.

723
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,200
We have to give him a parcel.

724
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:50,800
Pooja, I was here...

725
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:07,000
Hey! What are you doing?

726
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:10,400
I have some problem with the engine.
I'm fixing it.

727
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,200
Any problem...

728
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:15,400
You're disturbing people's sleep.

729
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,600
Sell it as junk.

730
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:23,800
She's your wife?

731
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:29,200
Go, take a taxi!
Get out.

732
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:34,600
I think it will be better
if we are not seen here for some time.

733
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,200
Get in.

734
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:35,200
Who'll go in first? Me?
- Yes scared?

735
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:41,800
Go!

736
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:08,600
There is no one here.
The field is clear.

737
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:15,800
Quite an expensively done up place.
- Yes.

738
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,000
What a house!

739
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:21,600
We must tell Ramanbhai
to buy us such a flat.

740
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:24,400
Consider this your own home.
Take it over.

741
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:29,400
How can I?
Is there no law and order in this city.

742
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:32,000
Where is the law?
Didn't we barge in?

743
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,800
What beep is this?
- Is it the washing machine?

744
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:40,000
Is it the telephone?

745
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:43,000
Every beep for you's of the telephone.

746
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Didn't I tell you it was the phone?

747
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:52,800
That beep was a signal.

748
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,400
This is 367984.

749
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,400
Please leave a message
after the long beep.

750
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:05,000
Aditya, pick up the phone.
Pick up the phone.

751
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,400
I know you are there.

752
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,200
Anyway, I am in Naaz restaurant.

753
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:12,400
I am with KC.
I will come home with him tonight.

754
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,400
Don't be at home.

755
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:21,000
What did she say?
- Play it again.

756
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,600
She seems to be our hero's wife.
It was her voice on the phone.

757
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:35,000
She's a flirt.

758
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:37,200
She's roaming around with another guy.

759
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:43,200
Our Ramanbhai is after her husband
and she is after another man.

760
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,200
Tell me something.

761
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:51,200
If our wives were to say this
would we have tolerated it?

762
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:53,400
My wife says that sometimes
when she is angry.

763
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:58,000
So do you tolerate it?
- I slap her hard.

764
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:24,600
Aziz, how come you are here?
- Kaderbhai is inside.

765
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,800
He's not well,
yet he's come to meet you.

766
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:33,600
We had a hard time finding you.

767
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:46,800
What happened?
Not feeling well?

768
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:50,200
What are you doing?
Have you gone mad?

769
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,600
I don't understand.
- Sit down.

770
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:00,800
Praful Kalia had come to me.
He wants a compromise with you.

771
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:06,600
He cheated me, Bhai.

772
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,800
He created a rift between me and Vilas.

773
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,000
What is done is done.
Now work together.

774
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:19,400
It's very difficult.
- Praful is ready to apologize.

775
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:22,400
But I am not ready to forgive him.

776
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,600
Sir, you please don't interfere.

777
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:29,200
The other dons are also
ready to join hands with you.

778
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:31,200
Even the police is fed up of you.

779
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:34,000
You will get killed
in an encounter one day.

780
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,000
You will keep your honour...

781
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:40,400
Don't teach me
how honour is kept.

782
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:44,000
Right now,
if I pump bullets into you...

783
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,800
...I'll become the don
of the underworld.

784
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:50,800
Don't interfere in this matter.

785
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,800
Stop acting stupid.
You got slapped in the hotel today.

786
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,800
Tomorrow you may get killed
at some crazy man's hands.

787
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:00,600
I don't care.

788
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:10,200
What did he say?
- He was talking of a compromise.

789
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:12,400
What's taking them so long?

790
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:16,800
Salim, you stay here.
I'll inform Boss of developments.

791
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,200
We can get our hero through his wife.

792
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:23,000
You stay here.
- And shoot carefully.

793
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:25,600
Aim his legs,
don't blow off his brains.

794
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:28,600
Remember you had blown off
Gaikwad's brains?

795
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,600
Go now!

796
01:07:56,800 --> 01:08:00,200
What have I done to you?
Why are you all after me?

797
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:49,000
"Whether we make enemies."

798
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:57,400
"Or fall in love with someone."

799
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:05,800
"As long as we live,
we'll need a companion."

800
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:15,600
"Whether we make enemies
or we fall in love."

801
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:22,600
"As long as we live,
we'll need a companion."

802
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:27,200
"Whether we make enemies."

803
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:30,600
"Or fall in love with someone."
- If you like, you can go to my house.

804
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:32,200
We'll join you soon.

805
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,600
Pooja, you don't want to talk to me.

806
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:40,400
You don't want to dance with me.
Then why have I come with you?

807
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:46,400
Because I have brought you along.
- Why?

808
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:52,200
Because I trust you,
- Then tell me what happened.

809
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:55,000
How can I?

810
01:09:55,600 --> 01:10:01,000
Okay. All right.
- Just go, please. Just go, please

811
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:19,000
"Any excuse! Any saga!"

812
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:22,800
"Keep it a secret."

813
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:28,400
"Any excuse! Any saga!"

814
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:32,600
"Keep it a secret."

815
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:43,000
"Preserve your dreams
as long as you can."

816
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:49,600
"If you don't have a companion
it will be disastrous."

817
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:58,200
"Whether we make enemies
or we fall in love."

818
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:06,200
"As long as we live,
we'll need a companion."

819
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:33,600
Follow him.

820
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,400
Hey, there he is!

821
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:44,800
Drive!

822
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,400
Get the car out quick!

823
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:53,800
Move it!

824
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:59,200
Faster, faster!

825
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,200
Don't be afraid. Drive!

826
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:12,200
Ask him to move. Hey, let us pass!

827
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:14,800
Faster!

828
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:21,400
Hey fatso!

829
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:28,000
Move!

830
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:29,600
Move ahead.

831
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:53,800
Move!

832
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,800
Move!

833
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:20,200
No one will shoot!
I want him alive!

834
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,800
You!

835
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:50,600
Careful!

836
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:48,200
Boss. Boss!

837
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:51,200
Where is he Boss?
- Are you alright?

838
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:53,200
Do you want to go to the hospital?

839
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:55,400
Are you alright?

840
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:12,600
You remember where the hero lives?

841
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:18,600
Let's go, we have to go there.

842
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,800
How will you kill Raman?

843
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:29,000
I don't know.

844
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:31,400
Why are you asking me
this again and again?

845
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,200
I will kill him.

846
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:42,400
What business are you into?
- I work in an office.

847
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:47,400
Now leave, why are you stuck with me?

848
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:49,800
Leave, or you may get killed.

849
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:55,800
Where will I go now?

850
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:02,400
My wife is...
- Keep quiet! Praful has come.

851
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:10,600
I've come.

852
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:13,600
Have you brought it?

853
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,800
What are you saying, brother Vilas?
What are you saying?

854
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:22,200
Once I give my word, I keep it.

855
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,600
I've brought it.
- Where is it?

856
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:29,800
You still think I am cheating you?

857
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:33,600
Whatever happened earlier was due
to my old enmity with Raman.

858
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:37,200
If I had any enmity with you,
would I come here to meet you?

859
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:41,800
You would have.
You are going to gain more from it.

860
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:46,200
What gain? If I wanted,
I could have refused.

861
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,200
Keep it. Don't show me money.

862
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:05,400
You are out to kill Raman.
I won't take money from you.

863
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:17,400
The gun was just an excuse.
I've come to make you an offer.

864
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:22,800
If you like, we can work together.

865
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:25,600
I don't work with pimps.

866
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:37,000
You gave me the gun today...

867
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,400
...our deal is over.

868
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:44,200
No one has done anyone a favor.
- Hey! Enough!

869
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:48,200
No one has spoken to
Praful like that until today.

870
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:55,000
I regret your wife's death.
- Me too.

871
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:03,400
Come in.
- No Pooja, I'm leaving.

872
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:04,800
Come on!

873
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:25,000
He's inside.

874
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:27,400
I really should go.
- Why?

875
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:29,400
Aditya...
- Sit down, this is my house too.

876
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:31,000
I'll get you a drink.

877
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:51,200
Take it.
- Thank you.

878
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:05,600
What is the matter?

879
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:07,800
What happened?

880
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,000
What happened, Pooja?

881
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:16,400
Don't you understand?
He is having an affair.

882
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:22,200
Go call him. I want to finalize
everything in your presence.

883
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:25,800
Go and call him.
- Alright, I'll call him.

884
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:27,600
I'll call him now.

885
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:45,600
Aditya

886
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:54,600
Pooja, he's not here.

887
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:04,800
Aditya, what's going on?
Don't create a scene. Stop it!

888
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,200
Don't shout!

889
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:08,600
Help!

890
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,000
Please help.

891
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:28,800
Mr. Verma! Open the door!

892
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:32,200
Mr. Verma, don't open the door.
I'm going to call the police.

893
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:34,800
Don't open the door at all!
You understand, please.

894
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:40,800
Oh, so the husband is inside,
and the police is coming.

895
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:44,200
Yes! Get him arrested.
The everyday nuisance will be over.

896
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:54,200
Who are you?

897
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:58,600
Who are you?

898
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:09,800
No one is answering the phone.

899
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:11,800
We'll wait for some more time.

900
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
If Pooja doesn't call, I'll go.

901
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:16,800
What's his name?

902
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:18,800
What did you say his name was?

903
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,200
What are you doing?

904
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:25,200
Your friend, whose father
is the police commissioner.

905
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,400
What's his number?
- 6295611.

906
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:32,400
What are you planning to do?
- We must inform the police.

907
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,600
You want us dead?
They'll come to know where we are.

908
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:39,400
Ramanbhai will have contacts
in the police department.

909
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:40,800
So what do I do?

910
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:44,200
Look Aditya...

911
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:49,400
I think for a few days you
should get out of this city.

912
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:02,200
He is right!

913
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:05,200
We'll go to some
other city for a few days.

914
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:13,600
I cannot leave Pooja and go anywhere.

915
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:24,000
I cannot. I'm sorry.

916
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:40,800
I am sorry.

917
01:22:54,400 --> 01:23:00,400
Friends, for our building society's party
we have invited some special guests.

918
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:03,800
We present, the Sea Green Party!

919
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:13,600
Whoever he was, he asked
me Aditya's address...

920
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:15,000
...and I gave it to him.

921
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:17,600
Where he went after that,
how do I know?

922
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:20,600
I wanted to give him a message.

923
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:26,000
That's why I am looking for him.
I'm hanging up now.

924
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:30,400
Yes, please hang up.

925
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:40,800
Look Vilas, my job is done.
I gave you Patel's number.

926
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:43,200
Patel has given
the boy's address too.

927
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:44,600
My job is done.

928
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:47,600
Don't involve me
into this problem anymore.

929
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:52,400
Look, ask this man to drop the gun.

930
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:56,800
Shetty, be careful. He's crazy.

931
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,200
If he pulls the trigger,
you'll be jumping like mad.

932
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:02,800
Your maid will have a problem
cleaning up your brains.

933
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:05,400
Let's go.

934
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:08,800
Come.

935
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,200
Come.

936
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:23,600
Now what?

937
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:27,200
He says you are a low life.

938
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,200
You will inform Raman after I leave.

939
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,600
So you must be killed.

940
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:39,800
He's crazy!
He's only talking of killing.

941
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:42,200
Where have you brought him from?

942
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:48,600
Why will I inform Raman?

943
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:50,200
I want to do business here.

944
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:53,400
I haven't come here to carry tales
from here to there.

945
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:58,400
See, wait a minute.

946
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:05,600
Okay? I disconnected all lines.

947
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:14,000
Where will I call from now?
Here, take this key.

948
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:17,800
This is the key to my house.
Here! Take it! Take it, Vilas.

949
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:19,200
This is the key to that room.

950
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:21,200
Lock me in the room...

951
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:24,200
...like you have locked up my family.

952
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:27,600
Vilasbhai, do you understand
what I am saying?

953
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:31,200
Vilasbhai, you are in this business
since very long.

954
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:35,800
Even I can be of use to you.

955
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:39,000
Just think. I could be useful.

956
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,800
Vilasbhai, what are you thinking?

957
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:51,800
What are you planning to do?

958
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,800
What are you planning to do?

959
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:00,000
Lock him in the room.

960
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:26,600
What did you do?
- He was trying to run away.

961
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:31,600
I fired, and he died!

962
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:38,200
Are you out of your mind?
- I was helping you.

963
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:44,800
He is at Rajesh Chopra's
apartment in Lokhandwala.

964
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Sea Green Apartment.

965
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:52,000
I don't know anything else.

966
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:09,600
I'll get you injected.

967
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:11,400
So late in the night?
- Yes.

968
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:14,000
We will get it done tomorrow.

969
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:35,400
I told you what I knew.

970
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:37,400
If you want,
you may take my money...

971
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:41,600
...but please let me go.

972
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:43,600
Do you consider us to be beggars?

973
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:45,200
No!
- Keep it.

974
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:50,200
You are a scoundrel.

975
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:54,600
Salim said that you were
trying to woo hero's wife.

976
01:27:56,600 --> 01:28:01,400
Extra marital affairs are common
in your society, isn't it?

977
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,200
No, I mean yes at times.

978
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:09,000
It's the same as there's murder
in your society.

979
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,000
You feel like cracking a joke?

980
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:18,200
Chotu.

981
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:21,800
Let's go.

982
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:25,400
Let's go.

983
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:35,800
You rascal.

984
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:39,800
How dare you abuse us?

985
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,800
You are abusing us?
- No, I didn't.

986
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:45,800
I got scared, so...
- Darn you!

987
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:49,000
Sit down.

988
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:57,800
What's going on here?

989
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,800
How did you enter?

990
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,200
Who are you?

991
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:11,000
We are decent people.

992
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:15,000
Look at your faces.

993
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:19,400
Who let you in?

994
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:21,000
Watchman!

995
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:23,400
Where is Pooja?

996
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,400
She is sleeping.
You too go and sleep.

997
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:45,600
Greetings, Boss.

998
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,200
What happened?

999
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:50,200
I looked everywhere
but could not find Praful Kalia.

1000
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,200
Where is your uniform?

1001
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:54,600
I'm not on duty now.

1002
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,400
Don't wear it even when you are.

1003
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:01,000
Of what use is your being
in the police force to me?

1004
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:04,600
I told you to find one Praful Kalia,
but you could not.

1005
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:08,200
Don't say that, Boss.
I did try hard.

1006
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:11,400
What did you try?
You are lying to me?

1007
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:13,600
You think I don't know
what you were doing?

1008
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:15,800
You were in the police station
distributing your bribe money.

1009
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:18,400
Tried indeed!

1010
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:25,400
Straighten yourself!
We have to take him to the hospital.

1011
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:29,400
He's hurt.
- Take him in a taxi.

1012
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Hey!

1013
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:34,400
What did you say?

1014
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:40,600
Is it beneath you to take
Chota to the hospital?

1015
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:42,000
It's not that...

1016
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,600
Look, you advise too much these days.

1017
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:47,400
Keep your advice to yourself.

1018
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:49,600
Clear?

1019
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:54,000
Go with Patankar.
- No Boss.

1020
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:56,600
Patankar...

1021
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,800
Boss, take care.
- Get in!

1022
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:20,400
Hurry up please,
quickly come with me.

1023
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:26,800
Take the jeep out,
I'm coming.

1024
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:34,600
Why did you have to tell them?
- What else could I do?

1025
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:37,000
Couldn't you have lied to them?
- What do you expect of me?

1026
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:40,000
What do you want from me?
- Oh shut up!

1027
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:43,800
You are too much! Enough!
- Get lost. K.C

1028
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:55,800
What happened?
- His wife has complained to the police.

1029
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:58,400
So?
- All inspectors are not like me.

1030
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:01,200
This inspector is very tough.
He'll arrest Ramanbhai.

1031
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:04,400
Let's tell Boss, hurry!
Come on.

1032
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:09,400
Pooja!

1033
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:16,600
They have come to know
where we are.

1034
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Run! Come.

1035
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:23,000
Hurry up!

1036
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:31,800
Pooja has left for coming here.
We'll pick her up downstairs.

1037
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:41,400
"The first time when we met."

1038
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:46,800
"The first time when we met."

1039
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:51,000
"The first time when we met."

1040
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:54,000
"The news spread far and wide."

1041
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:58,600
"You were the heart-throb of millions."

1042
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:01,000
"And I was one in a million."

1043
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:03,800
"You were the heart-throb of millions."

1044
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,800
"And I was one in a million."

1045
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:29,600
"You would shower your love on me."

1046
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:32,200
"We never remained apart for a moment."

1047
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:37,600
"Everyday we'd talk
secretly in sign language."

1048
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:42,800
"When we met the second time."

1049
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:47,400
"When we met the second time."

1050
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:50,400
"I came with a marriage proposal."

1051
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:55,200
"When we met the second time."

1052
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:57,600
"I came with a marriage proposal."

1053
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:00,200
"You were restless, I was eager."

1054
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:02,800
"I was your love
and you were my lover."

1055
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:05,200
"You were restless, I was eager."

1056
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:08,000
"I was your love
and you were my lover."

1057
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:31,000
"Your eyes were downcast."

1058
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,600
"We were so breathless."

1059
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:40,400
"You and I felt love all around us."

1060
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:44,400
"When we met the third time."

1061
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:49,000
"When we met the third time."

1062
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,600
"The family man had become an ascetic."

1063
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:56,600
"When we met the third time."

1064
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:59,000
"The family man had become an ascetic."

1065
01:34:59,200 --> 01:35:01,800
"You were looking dull."

1066
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:04,600
"And I had grown old too."

1067
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:27,400
"We both had developed a void."

1068
01:35:27,400 --> 01:35:29,800
"We would meet only sometimes."

1069
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
"You were busy with the children."

1070
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:35,000
"I would roam in the market."

1071
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:41,200
"When we met the fourth time."

1072
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:45,200
"When we met the fourth time."

1073
01:35:45,200 --> 01:35:47,600
"We both were in a terrible condition."

1074
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:53,000
"The personal discord
reached the courts."

1075
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:15,800
"We repent getting married."

1076
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,200
"We just destroyed ourselves."

1077
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:24,800
"Our happiness just turned
into flames of alienation."

1078
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:03,800
Who fired?
- The hero must have fired.

1079
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,600
On the terrace!

1080
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:09,800
Catch him!

1081
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,800
Catch him!

1082
01:37:17,400 --> 01:37:18,200
Stop.

1083
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:24,600
Vilas!

1084
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:33,800
Nothing happened, Boss.

1085
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,400
You worked for Ramanbhai
until yesterday.

1086
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,200
What happened now?

1087
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:51,000
How come Ramanbhai
and Vilasbhai have become enemies?

1088
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:56,800
Tell me what happened.
- Don't you know what happened?

1089
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:58,400
I know a little...

1090
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,600
...but you lost your chance.

1091
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:07,400
You killed a kid?
- Yes, so what will you do?

1092
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Tell.

1093
01:38:10,600 --> 01:38:12,000
I will bring two dons together.

1094
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:17,600
But one will be a corpse.
And it will be yours.

1095
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:22,600
Then shoot and kill me.

1096
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:27,200
Shoot Bansi, shoot!

1097
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:31,600
Fire! Bansi fire! Come on shoot.

1098
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:38,400
Hey! Give that to me! Leave!

1099
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:58,000
Stupid fellow,
First you release the safety.

1100
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:08,400
Hurry up!
- Take him in.

1101
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:12,200
Hurry up!
- Be careful.

1102
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:16,600
Go quickly,
We will follow you.

1103
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:18,800
How can you even think
I will go to her house?

1104
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:20,000
We have no other option.

1105
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:22,000
Malvika lives right
behind this building.

1106
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:25,800
No one will know we are here.
- Why, didn't you come here often?

1107
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,200
Have you gone mad?

1108
01:39:27,400 --> 01:39:30,400
Pooja, can you forget your
marriage problem for some time?

1109
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:32,600
Our lives are in danger.
- Explain to her!

1110
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:50,800
Call Dr. Deshpande.

1111
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:54,400
Chote, wake up.

1112
01:39:55,200 --> 01:39:56,200
Chote, wake up.

1113
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:00,400
What are you waiting for?

1114
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:06,200
Fire the shot and kill me!
Come on kill me.

1115
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:08,400
And go and take your charity
from Raman.

1116
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:13,400
Show him your dog like loyalty.
Kill me!

1117
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:17,600
I can do even that, Vilas.

1118
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:21,000
I can do that.

1119
01:40:24,200 --> 01:40:28,400
Inspector Patankar held a famous
underworld don captive in a building.

1120
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:34,600
Despite warning,
Vilas fired at Patankar.

1121
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:40,800
To save his life Patankar fired a shot
which claimed Vilas's life.

1122
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,400
This can be one story, Vilas.

1123
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:53,200
And what is the other story?

1124
01:41:03,400 --> 01:41:04,600
Keep your eyes open.

1125
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:06,000
You are alive,
nothing will happen to you.

1126
01:41:06,200 --> 01:41:08,400
Open your eyes nothing
is going to happen to you.

1127
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:13,000
Why isn't anybody here?
Where is Deshpande?

1128
01:41:14,600 --> 01:41:17,400
Chote!
- Keep moving.

1129
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:19,000
Chote!

1130
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:23,200
Come! Hurry!

1131
01:41:25,800 --> 01:41:28,000
Hurry up, doctor.
- Where were you?

1132
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:31,600
Attend to him. Make him alright.
- Chote.

1133
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:35,600
Nothing has happened to him.

1134
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:38,000
I don't want any bad news.

1135
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:41,000
I don't want any bad news.
Nothing has happened to him.

1136
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:44,000
He is like my son.

1137
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
Damn!
- Why are you crying?

1138
01:41:53,200 --> 01:41:55,600
Tell him to stop crying.
He's gone crazy.

1139
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:04,000
"What is life? Nobody knows."

1140
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:10,000
"What is life? Nobody knows."

1141
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:16,800
"Whoever knows it, repents."

1142
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:22,200
"Whoever knows it, repents."

1143
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:25,800
"Whoever knows it, repents."

1144
01:42:25,800 --> 01:42:29,200
"What is life?"

1145
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:37,000
"What is life, nobody knows."

1146
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:45,000
I have packed
something for you to eat.

1147
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:51,200
Will you have tea?
- No thank You.

1148
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,800
You can take some
of my clothes if you like.

1149
01:42:56,600 --> 01:42:58,600
Calcutta is very far,
you may need new clothes.

1150
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:00,600
No, I'll buy new ones.
- Sorry.

1151
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:02,200
Pooja.

1152
01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:05,400
Don't be rude.

1153
01:43:06,600 --> 01:43:09,400
She is right.
At such a late hour...

1154
01:43:11,400 --> 01:43:13,800
Malvika, pack a few clothes for her.

1155
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:19,600
Pooja, you are too much!

1156
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:28,600
Please tell me,
do you love him?

1157
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:31,000
Tell me, do you love him?

1158
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:34,800
Tell me.

1159
01:43:37,800 --> 01:43:39,000
Please, tell me.

1160
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:42,400
Want to know the truth?

1161
01:43:46,200 --> 01:43:47,200
No.

1162
01:43:49,200 --> 01:43:50,400
You are lying.

1163
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:54,400
Everyone is lying.

1164
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:13,600
"Our names are new."

1165
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:17,600
"Our names are new."

1166
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:21,600
"But the pain is old."

1167
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:25,800
"This pain is old."

1168
01:44:26,200 --> 01:44:29,400
"Our names are new."

1169
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:33,400
"Our names are new."

1170
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:37,600
"But the pain is old."

1171
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:45,800
"What is life? It is lighting a lamp
among swift winds."

1172
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:50,000
"Our names are new."

1173
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:53,200
"Our names are new."

1174
01:44:53,800 --> 01:44:55,800
It's Rs 10000
I could arrange only this much.

1175
01:44:56,400 --> 01:44:57,800
The taxi is waiting, hurry up.

1176
01:44:58,600 --> 01:45:00,000
We have to buy the tickets yet.

1177
01:45:21,800 --> 01:45:25,600
I'll come back to meet you.
- Why will you come?

1178
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:28,600
Can't I come?
- I won't be here.

1179
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:31,800
Where are you going?
- None of your business.

1180
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:33,600
She's there waiting for you.

1181
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:42,600
Don't think I was just
fooling around with you.

1182
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:48,800
I love you.
- Get out!

1183
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:53,000
"Which land is the land of sorrows?"

1184
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:57,000
"No value for tears."

1185
01:46:01,200 --> 01:46:05,000
"Which land is the land of sorrows?"

1186
01:46:05,200 --> 01:46:08,600
"No value for tears."

1187
01:46:09,200 --> 01:46:15,600
"Everyone is a stranger to me."

1188
01:46:17,400 --> 01:46:21,400
"Everyone is a stranger to me."

1189
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:24,800
"No one will help anyone here."

1190
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:41,400
"Everyone has to deal
with his own pain."

1191
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:45,000
"Our names are new."

1192
01:46:45,200 --> 01:46:49,400
"But the pain is old."

1193
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:57,600
"What is life? It is lighting a lamp
among swift winds."

1194
01:46:57,800 --> 01:47:01,400
"Our names are new."

1195
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:05,200
"Our names are new."

1196
01:47:23,400 --> 01:47:25,600
He loved my sister very much.

1197
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:34,000
He thought I didn't know.

1198
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:39,400
They met secretly.

1199
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:48,800
I thought when the time was right.

1200
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:52,000
I'd get them married
in a 5-star hotel.

1201
01:47:59,200 --> 01:48:00,800
I had nobody else.

1202
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:07,400
Whatever I had would've
belonged to him.

1203
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:20,800
Don't cry.

1204
01:48:23,800 --> 01:48:25,600
Don't cry, it's no use.
He's gone.

1205
01:48:31,400 --> 01:48:32,400
Take him away.

1206
01:48:45,400 --> 01:48:46,600
Malvika!

1207
01:48:53,200 --> 01:48:56,600
You are going somewhere?
- Yes.

1208
01:48:56,800 --> 01:48:58,000
Where?

1209
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:02,400
To my sister in Paris.

1210
01:49:05,200 --> 01:49:08,000
Malvika, don't go.

1211
01:49:09,400 --> 01:49:10,800
What is left for me here?

1212
01:49:12,600 --> 01:49:16,800
Malvika please...
- I can't live here, Rajesh.

1213
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,400
Everything here reminds me of Aditya.

1214
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:25,600
Forget that lowlife!

1215
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:30,600
What are you saying, Rajesh?
He is your friend.

1216
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:35,400
No, he's not my friend.

1217
01:49:36,200 --> 01:49:38,400
I am his friend,
but he is not my friend.

1218
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:40,200
I love him.

1219
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:43,000
But he doesn't love you.

1220
01:49:43,400 --> 01:49:46,400
He has left with his wife,
leaving you behind.

1221
01:49:49,200 --> 01:49:50,400
Look Malvika...

1222
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
I never said anything to you,
until today.

1223
01:49:53,600 --> 01:49:57,600
I used to go away,
leaving you two alone in my flat.

1224
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,600
But...
- Don't say it.

1225
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:02,600
Don't say that you love me.

1226
01:50:05,800 --> 01:50:07,000
But.

1227
01:50:09,400 --> 01:50:15,000
It is true
that I always loved you.

1228
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:20,800
I never told you this until today.

1229
01:50:22,200 --> 01:50:25,400
But today when that
lowlife did this act.

1230
01:50:27,200 --> 01:50:30,000
Stop your nonsense!

1231
01:50:30,600 --> 01:50:34,400
I don't love you,
I love Aditya.

1232
01:50:36,200 --> 01:50:39,000
Get out of here!

1233
01:50:52,200 --> 01:50:55,400
Wherever you are, be happy.

1234
01:51:11,200 --> 01:51:12,800
Stop crying. Stop it!

1235
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:23,800
I want that hero.

1236
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:29,400
I want him dead.

1237
01:51:48,600 --> 01:51:52,200
Boss, that fatso is hero's friend.

1238
01:51:53,200 --> 01:51:57,400
It looks like him.
- It's him!

1239
01:51:57,600 --> 01:51:59,200
Wait a minute!

1240
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:05,000
Where is that hero?
- He's not here.

1241
01:52:06,600 --> 01:52:08,400
Leave him!

1242
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:10,200
I have come to tell you where he is.

1243
01:52:22,600 --> 01:52:24,400
Why have you walked...

1244
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:28,400
...to your death?

1245
01:52:29,600 --> 01:52:33,600
You want to know where Aditya is?
I can tell you.

1246
01:52:35,400 --> 01:52:39,400
I will tell them I had to speak
because you beat me a lot.

1247
01:52:48,600 --> 01:52:52,800
"No relationship is stable."

1248
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:56,600
"I've seen every kind of affiliation."

1249
01:52:56,800 --> 01:53:03,000
"In the hands of indefinite time..."

1250
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:12,400
"In the hands of indefinite time
every life is a toy."

1251
01:53:21,200 --> 01:53:28,200
"Everyone has to repay
the debt of life."

1252
01:53:30,200 --> 01:53:32,200
I'll look for the ticket checker,
you stay here.

1253
01:53:32,400 --> 01:53:33,600
You won't go to Calcutta.

1254
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
I said that
you will not go to Calcutta.

1255
01:53:37,400 --> 01:53:38,400
What do you mean?

1256
01:53:40,200 --> 01:53:41,200
I will go alone.

1257
01:53:41,800 --> 01:53:43,000
Look, you...
- If I am with you right now...

1258
01:53:43,200 --> 01:53:45,800
...it doesn't mean I've forgiven you.

1259
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,200
What nonsense are you talking!
We can discuss this later.

1260
01:53:48,400 --> 01:53:50,200
Do you know what you did to me?

1261
01:53:57,200 --> 01:53:59,600
After tonight,
everything has changed.

1262
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:07,000
I want time.

1263
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:17,400
Alright, I'll arrange your ticket.

1264
01:54:30,600 --> 01:54:31,800
Ticket checker, excuse me!

1265
01:54:32,600 --> 01:54:36,000
Listen! I need you, listen!

1266
01:54:36,400 --> 01:54:40,200
Listen to me, please.

1267
01:55:12,200 --> 01:55:15,400
Aditya! Aditya!

1268
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
They're taking my husband...

1269
01:55:21,600 --> 01:55:23,400
Rajesh, you?

1270
01:55:24,600 --> 01:55:27,000
How come you are here?

1271
01:55:27,600 --> 01:55:31,200
I had to tell them.
They threatened to kill me.

1272
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:39,800
What do you expect?

1273
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:42,800
That I'd sacrifice my life
for that rogue?

1274
01:55:43,600 --> 01:55:46,800
See what he did to you.
And even Malvika...

1275
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,200
Even you should leave him.

1276
01:56:37,800 --> 01:56:43,000
What is it? Whose compromise
have you come for now?

1277
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
No compromise will
take place here now, Raman.

1278
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:54,000
I've come to kill you, you swine!

1279
01:56:54,800 --> 01:56:57,400
Shut up you fools.

1280
01:56:58,600 --> 01:57:00,400
Stay inside!

1281
01:57:01,200 --> 01:57:02,800
I'll kill you if you move!

1282
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:14,000
You killed my Chota.

1283
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:16,200
Right, rascal!

1284
01:57:23,400 --> 01:57:24,600
But you survived.

1285
01:57:26,600 --> 01:57:28,800
You understood now
who the bullet was for?

1286
01:57:29,600 --> 01:57:31,200
You killed Chota!

1287
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
Get out! Get out!

1288
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:49,000
Vilas...
- Patankar, get his gun.

1289
01:57:49,800 --> 01:57:51,400
Get his gun!

1290
01:57:51,400 --> 01:57:53,600
Don't move!
- Are you nuts?

1291
01:57:53,800 --> 01:57:55,800
Come on!
- I'm giving.

1292
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,600
Go and stand there.

1293
01:58:16,600 --> 01:58:20,000
Search him.
- Take out!

1294
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:24,400
Take out the weapon.

1295
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:33,200
Ganya!

1296
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:36,800
What are you doing, Ganesh!

1297
01:58:37,200 --> 01:58:39,000
You!!

1298
01:58:39,200 --> 01:58:40,400
Now tell me.

1299
01:58:41,600 --> 01:58:42,800
Come on get up.

1300
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:44,800
Get up!
Get up!

1301
01:58:45,400 --> 01:58:49,200
Leave, or your family will go hungry.

1302
01:58:49,800 --> 01:58:52,200
Or do you want to die
a loyal dog's death?

1303
01:58:53,600 --> 01:58:55,600
Or bullets will be wasted.

1304
01:58:55,600 --> 01:58:57,800
We are leaving!

1305
01:58:59,800 --> 01:59:01,000
Leave!

1306
01:59:09,600 --> 01:59:13,000
But what about him?

1307
01:59:13,800 --> 01:59:18,200
If he survives, he will not spare us.

1308
01:59:20,200 --> 01:59:24,600
That's my guarantee.
He will not survive.

1309
01:59:29,800 --> 01:59:33,000
Shankar, Ganesh,

1310
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:36,400
Meet me tomorrow.

1311
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:07,600
Why do you care who Rajesh is?

1312
02:00:07,800 --> 02:00:11,600
I told you he told me one of their men
must be in hospital.

1313
02:00:11,800 --> 02:00:13,000
There is he.

1314
02:00:13,800 --> 02:00:15,000
That's him!

1315
02:00:29,600 --> 02:00:30,800
What are you doing?

1316
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:34,200
What are you doing, Vilas?

1317
02:00:37,200 --> 02:00:38,400
Have you gone mad?

1318
02:00:39,400 --> 02:00:40,600
You are right.

1319
02:00:42,600 --> 02:00:45,800
I have gone mad.

1320
02:00:46,200 --> 02:00:49,000
You forgot everything.
- I haven't forgotten, Raman.

1321
02:00:50,800 --> 02:00:52,000
You have forgotten.

1322
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:56,200
What did I forget?
- You killed Shobha.

1323
02:00:56,400 --> 02:01:01,000
Vilas, that was just an accident.

1324
02:01:06,400 --> 02:01:08,000
Even this is an accident.

1325
02:01:08,600 --> 02:01:09,800
Vilas...

1326
02:01:11,200 --> 02:01:16,000
...you forgot our friendship
of so many years...

1327
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:20,000
...and joined hands with him?

1328
02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:22,800
The one who told me
you are Praful Kalia's man?

1329
02:01:23,800 --> 02:01:26,800
The one who told me you accepted
one million rupees to betray me?

1330
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,400
You are lying.
- No, I am not lying.

1331
02:01:31,200 --> 02:01:33,200
He told me in which hotel you are.

1332
02:01:33,600 --> 02:01:37,600
That is why I came there,
and that's why Shobha died.

1333
02:01:37,800 --> 02:01:42,000
Shut-up! Shut-up!

1334
02:01:49,400 --> 02:01:53,800
I swear by Chote, I am not lying.

1335
02:01:56,800 --> 02:01:58,400
He created a rift between us.

1336
02:02:01,800 --> 02:02:06,400
You have to kill him.

1337
02:02:07,800 --> 02:02:09,200
Kill him.

1338
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,400
Hey Vilas.

1339
02:02:36,600 --> 02:02:37,600
Patankar!

1340
02:02:39,200 --> 02:02:43,000
Hey Patankar,
Vilas pull out your gun.

1341
02:02:48,600 --> 02:02:53,400
You dog!
You will die a dog's death!

1342
02:02:54,600 --> 02:02:55,800
You are right.

1343
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:08,000
Vilas!

1344
02:03:24,600 --> 02:03:27,000
It will make a very good
news item in tomorrow's papers.

1345
02:03:29,200 --> 02:03:32,000
Two dons kill each other in a gang war.

1346
02:03:36,400 --> 02:03:38,200
You dog!

1347
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:00,800
Patankar!

1348
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:06,400
I won't spare you!

1349
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:08,400
Is anyone around?

1350
02:04:09,200 --> 02:04:10,800
Is anyone around?

1351
02:04:15,400 --> 02:04:16,800
Is anyone around?

1352
02:04:20,800 --> 02:04:22,400
Is anyone around?

1353
02:04:26,200 --> 02:04:28,200
Someone release me!

1354
02:04:47,400 --> 02:04:48,400
Release me come on.

1355
02:04:50,400 --> 02:04:51,600
Release me.

1356
02:04:56,400 --> 02:04:58,600
Untie me! Untie me!

1357
02:04:59,800 --> 02:05:05,800
Release me,
what are you staring at me for?

1358
02:05:08,400 --> 02:05:10,800
The train is coming.
Release me!

1359
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,400
Release me!

1360
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:20,400
Untie me!

1361
02:05:23,200 --> 02:05:24,400
Untie me!

1362
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:26,600
Untie me!

1363
02:05:54,400 --> 02:05:56,000
The great Ramanbhai!

1364
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:00,200
Scared, aren't you?

1365
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:03,400
Where is your bravery?

1366
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:12,000
Hero.

1367
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:19,800
Hero, release me.

1368
02:06:20,600 --> 02:06:24,400
Release me, you ruffian!
- Don't shout!

1369
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:35,000
One more train will come.
This time, it'll come on this track.

1370
02:06:35,600 --> 02:06:45,000
How much money will you make
through your advertising?

1371
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
One lakh, two lakhs, three lakhs?

1372
02:06:47,200 --> 02:06:49,600
I'll give you ten million.

1373
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:51,000
Release me.

1374
02:06:54,200 --> 02:06:56,000
I slapped you...

1375
02:06:59,400 --> 02:07:00,800
...won't you take revenge?

1376
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:05,200
Forget all that.
I have forgiven you.

1377
02:07:05,400 --> 02:07:08,200
I apologize to you.
- Won't you kill me?

1378
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,400
All night,
you were after my life.

1379
02:07:11,600 --> 02:07:13,400
Now you're begging me for your life.

1380
02:07:14,400 --> 02:07:18,200
Hero, release me.
Look, the train is coming.

1381
02:07:18,600 --> 02:07:23,200
I'll die. Look, I have two sisters.

1382
02:07:23,800 --> 02:07:26,000
Release me.
They are dependent on me.

1383
02:07:26,200 --> 02:07:31,200
Hey hero, I don't want to die!

1384
02:07:33,600 --> 02:07:36,600
The train is coming!
Release me!

1385
02:07:36,800 --> 02:07:39,400
Release me!

1386
02:07:39,800 --> 02:07:42,600
I don't want to die.
Release me soon!

1387
02:07:42,800 --> 02:07:50,600
Open it quickly. Quickly!

1388
02:07:50,800 --> 02:07:54,200
Quickly!

1389
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:32,200
Help me up.

1390
02:08:40,600 --> 02:08:41,800
Give me the gun.

1391
02:09:00,200 --> 02:09:04,600
Another news will get published
in the newspaper tomorrow.

1392
02:09:06,600 --> 02:09:09,200
Along with Shankar and Ganesh...

1393
02:09:10,600 --> 02:09:13,800
...the police inspector's body.

1394
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:19,000
Hero, you can go.

1395
02:09:21,200 --> 02:09:23,200
You saved my life.

1396
02:09:24,200 --> 02:09:26,000
I have forgiven you. Go.

1397
02:09:26,600 --> 02:09:31,400
Hey, what a despicable man you are!

1398
02:09:35,600 --> 02:09:39,000
What did you say?
- I said you are a despicable man!

1399
02:09:42,600 --> 02:09:45,000
I made a mistake by releasing you.

1400
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:48,800
You should have died
under the train.

1401
02:09:50,600 --> 02:09:52,800
And your body ravaged by dogs!

1402
02:09:53,800 --> 02:09:57,000
I was stupid to have released
a despicable man like you.

1403
02:09:58,000 --> 02:09:59,200
Hey!

1404
02:10:13,200 --> 02:10:17,800
Apologize! Come on, apologize!

1405
02:10:20,200 --> 02:10:21,400
You think...

1406
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:28,000
...you saved my life
for one million rupees...

1407
02:10:28,200 --> 02:10:30,200
...and so can say anything to me?

1408
02:10:33,400 --> 02:10:36,200
Lick this!

1409
02:10:41,600 --> 02:10:45,400
See, the train is coming.
I'll shoot you right here.

1410
02:10:46,400 --> 02:10:48,600
And you will die under this train.

1411
02:10:49,800 --> 02:10:51,400
Apologize.
- Shoot!

1412
02:10:54,800 --> 02:10:59,000
I should have done this before.
I should have confronted you.

1413
02:10:59,800 --> 02:11:01,600
I did you a favor...

1414
02:11:01,800 --> 02:11:04,200
...I saved your life
and you threaten me?

1415
02:11:04,600 --> 02:11:10,200
Shoot!
- Apologize!

1416
02:11:11,400 --> 02:11:13,600
Apologize!
- If you have the guts, shoot!

1417
02:11:13,800 --> 02:11:16,000
Hey hero!

1418
02:11:16,800 --> 02:11:18,200
Hey hero!

1419
02:11:18,600 --> 02:11:19,800
Hey hero!

1420
02:11:43,200 --> 02:11:48,800
"Man kills man."

1421
02:11:53,600 --> 02:11:59,800
"Man creates bonds with man."

1422
02:12:00,600 --> 02:12:07,000
"Why do things happen the way they do?"

1423
02:12:07,200 --> 02:12:09,800
"No one can understand it."

1424
02:12:14,200 --> 02:12:21,200
"Whoever knows it, repents. Repents."

1425
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:32,200
"What is life? Nobody knows."

1426
02:12:38,800 --> 02:12:46,200
"What is life? Nobody knows."

1427
02:13:19,800 --> 02:13:23,200
Mr. Aditya, what chaos did you create?

1428
02:13:23,600 --> 02:13:25,000
I didn't sleep all of last night.

1429
02:13:25,400 --> 02:13:28,000
This is a reputed building,
not some slum.

1430
02:13:28,600 --> 02:13:31,200
One bad fish dirties the whole pond.

1431
02:13:31,400 --> 02:13:32,600
Do you get it?

1432
02:13:32,800 --> 02:13:35,400
Wonder where you bring
all those ruffians from.

1433
02:13:35,800 --> 02:13:38,000
See! They just turn and leave.

1434
02:13:38,600 --> 02:13:40,200
But I won't let this rest.

1435
02:13:40,600 --> 02:13:43,000
I'll complain
in the building society's office.
