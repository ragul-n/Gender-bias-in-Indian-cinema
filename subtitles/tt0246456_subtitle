24.000 FPS

2
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,292
''it’s just that the storm was
being respectful to my age''

3
00:00:52,334 --> 00:00:58,709
''And the world thought
my boat was trapped midwaters''

4
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:13,665
Writer Manav...
- Shame! Shame!

5
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:18,875
End...
- insults to women!

6
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:26,000
''As you can see, the Women's Welfare
Association is staging a demonstration''

7
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:29,625
We're standing outside the
famous novelist Manav's house...

8
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:31,999
who has written several
bestselling novels

9
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,333
Every page of the novels he
has written depict women...

10
00:01:34,334 --> 00:01:38,625
''as gold-diggers,
opportunists and betrayers''

11
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,999
Looks like these women have reached
the end of their patience

12
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,916
They have thus given up
their chores at home...

13
00:01:43,917 --> 00:01:45,832
to spill out on the streets

14
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:49,041
They're demanding an end to the
insults being heaped on womenfolk...

15
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:53,209
and threaten disastrous consequences.
What effect will this have...

16
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:57,250
on the writer Manav? Will he be able
to face the ire of these women?

17
00:01:58,292 --> 00:02:04,333
Writer Manav...
- Shame! Shame!

18
00:02:04,334 --> 00:02:06,624
Were you saying something?

19
00:02:06,625 --> 00:02:11,541
These stones and the broken window panes
are testimony to the women's anger

20
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:13,457
What is your take on all this?

21
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:17,291
This stole-pelting and show of anger
gives me extra courage

22
00:02:17,292 --> 00:02:21,250
They can break my window-panes
and stop my car on the streets

23
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:25,374
But they can't stop my pen
from put ink to paper

24
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:28,582
''As long as l live,
my pen will also live...''

25
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:30,665
and keep holding the mirror
of truth to the womenfolk

26
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:33,708
What's your source of inspiration?
Where do you bring these ideas from?

27
00:02:34,084 --> 00:02:38,583
l don't need to. What l see
gets written on paper

28
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:43,416
''Women have always been portrayed as ones
that are loyal, helpless and pitiable''

29
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:45,999
Behind the facade however...

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,292
that helpless woman makes men dance
to her tunes like puppets

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,249
l can quote several instances
to prove this point

32
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,708
''l have seen women groveling
before god men, instead of God''

33
00:02:58,792 --> 00:03:02,791
l have seen so-called devoted wives
having a nice time with other men

34
00:03:02,792 --> 00:03:07,500
My novels aren't just imagination.
They're words of truth

35
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:10,540
Can you tell us something
about your next novel?

36
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:12,457
Yet another truth

37
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,666
This time l deal with
a facet of women...

38
00:03:14,667 --> 00:03:17,291
which people call their
helplessness and plight

39
00:03:17,292 --> 00:03:21,833
''Women, in the garb of being
helpless, exploited...''

40
00:03:22,667 --> 00:03:26,332
have been deceiving men
for years and centuries

41
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:29,624
They've been using their bodies
like blank cheques

42
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:33,582
And now I’m going to expose
this wholesale flesh market

43
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:36,959
The name of this novel will be
Bazaar (The marketplace)

44
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:44,875
''Get going, you pimp! l wonder
where this scoundrel comes from!''

45
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:49,291
You take this for your mother's hotel?
Free food...?

46
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:55,833
''it costs money, mister.
This is a marketplace''

47
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:57,249
Hey fatso!
- Uncle... who's that?

48
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:01,208
He's the number one pimp of
this red-light district

49
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:03,290
A real bastard

50
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:06,875
''What place is this, sir?
- This is where you got to live''

51
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:11,332
Here...?
What place have you brought me to?

52
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:14,666
I’ll do the explaining!

53
00:06:14,667 --> 00:06:19,250
When the girls in the world
have no other work to do...

54
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,208
this is the place
they get to work

55
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:28,875
Now... don't you also want to work?
Earn some money perhaps...

56
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:33,250
repay your father's loans
and settle down in life?

57
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:36,792
That's it then.
You've come to the right place!

58
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:42,500
Living here and working here will
make sure your dreams are realized

59
00:06:47,084 --> 00:06:49,332
Hey... you fell down again?

60
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:52,500
''You rotten hide,
damn you!''

61
00:06:52,917 --> 00:06:55,791
''Speak up, pimp''

62
00:06:55,792 --> 00:06:58,958
''Fakira, aren't you ever
going to relent?''

63
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:01,833
''l will, but not my trumpet''

64
00:07:01,834 --> 00:07:04,624
Whenever it sees someone evil
with evil on his mind...

65
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:07,708
it starts speaking on its own!
- Will you shut up now...?

66
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,624
or must l beat you with my shoes?
This sandal!

67
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:14,208
No big deal. Some people live off
other people's bodies

68
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:19,082
Won't make any difference
if l take a knock or two

69
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:24,290
Enough of your nonsense!
Don't ruin my business

70
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:27,290
''I’m going to fix Fakira for good...
- Muskaan, let's go!''

71
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:29,582
Hey! Get him!

72
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:35,042
Rangila! Save my girl!

73
00:07:36,042 --> 00:07:37,000
Kill him!

74
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,375
C'mon!

75
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:39,082
This is Anna's area

76
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:42,250
Even the breeze in this place
blows only with Anna's permission

77
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:45,624
Not even a leaf moves without
my permission and you...

78
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:49,958
you're running away with
a girl from my area?

79
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:53,332
You plan on selling
the girl elsewhere?

80
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:56,875
''I’m the one who brought the girl
here, Anna! And this cad...''

81
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:03,958
he plans on bolting with her!

82
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:16,292
''Listen, baby... your first
mistake, Anna's going to forgive''

83
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:21,875
''But if you do such a thing again,
I’ll throw acid on your face...''

84
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:28,042
and destroy it

85
00:09:28,792 --> 00:09:30,957
Bring her inside.
- Move it!

86
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:34,749
You'll now get to know
the rules of the game!

87
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:38,249
''Here you are. 100,000 rupees''

88
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,792
You've counted it.
And I’ve smelt it

89
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,833
it’s all the same.
- Your daughter is now sold!

90
00:09:45,834 --> 00:09:49,249
''l know, I’ve sold
my daughter to you''

91
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:52,375
''Do what you want to.
As far as I’m concerned, she's dead''

92
00:09:52,667 --> 00:09:56,291
''Father, how can you treat me
so shabbily?''

93
00:09:56,292 --> 00:09:59,792
l loved you more than I’d have
loved my own father!

94
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:07,584
But you have turned out to be
a snake in the grass!

95
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:12,291
in this marketplace
of butchers...

96
00:10:12,292 --> 00:10:17,374
how could you sell
your daughter away?

97
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:22,958
Would you have done this if
it were your own daughter?

98
00:10:23,417 --> 00:10:25,833
There are bigger scoundrels
than me in the world

99
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:28,666
''For money, they sell
whole families''

100
00:10:28,667 --> 00:10:32,332
I’ve only made a deal to
sell off a step-daughter

101
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:35,667
''And now, your step-daughter
curses you!''

102
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,666
You will never be happy!

103
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:44,000
''You will pay with your body
for the 100,000 you've got!''

104
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:49,625
You'll lie at the square!
Writhing in agony!

105
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:55,584
''Forget a human being, not even
a dog will sniff at you!''

106
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,332
The dogs will sniff at him
and even pee on him

107
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:02,040
''Now listen careful to me, lady''

108
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:05,291
This isn't a temple where you're
going around cursing people!

109
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:09,833
This is Anna's brothel! I’ve made
such a big payment for you

110
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:14,250
So go and get ready. You've got to
attend to a very wealthy customer

111
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,875
''To deflower you, he'll have a nuptial
night with you without a wedding...''

112
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:25,667
''Anna, l beg you!
Please don't be so evil''

113
00:11:26,584 --> 00:11:29,874
Muskaan means the life to me.
I’ll die without her

114
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:34,833
What a lover-boy!
But we don't do charity here

115
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,082
This is Anna's brothel!

116
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:42,292
''Didn't you see how l gave away
100,000 rupees for the girl?''

117
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:46,292
Who's going to pay me?
- I’ll pay you!

118
00:11:47,542 --> 00:11:49,749
''I’ll even sell myself,
but return the money to you''

119
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:54,249
Can you pay me a million?
- Million?

120
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:58,375
Good Lord! Out of steam already?

121
00:11:59,292 --> 00:12:03,416
All right.
I’ll pay you a million

122
00:12:03,417 --> 00:12:06,625
Bring the million rupees
within a month

123
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:11,541
''lf you can't, just don't
come back here''

124
00:12:11,542 --> 00:12:14,291
You agree?
- l agree

125
00:12:14,292 --> 00:12:17,417
So what are you waiting for?
Go and raise the money

126
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:21,749
Gulabo... take him away

127
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:27,750
''Meet her for a while, okay?
And go away''

128
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,249
Whatever's in your heart...

129
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,542
tell me

130
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,375
''Whether you consent
or disapprove...''

131
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:04,584
do tell me

132
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:08,791
Do tell me

133
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:28,291
Whatever's in your heart...

134
00:13:28,292 --> 00:13:30,584
tell me

135
00:13:38,292 --> 00:13:42,749
Hey heroine... get up

136
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,833
''Wake up, heroine!
Haven't you heard me?''

137
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:47,250
Get up

138
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:53,790
Sit up straight.
And have this food

139
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:58,291
l don't want this food.
Take it away

140
00:13:58,292 --> 00:14:02,625
''Why act funny, girl?
Why ruin your youthfulness?''

141
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:04,542
Eat it up

142
00:14:06,292 --> 00:14:09,333
l don't want to eat this food.
- She won't eat our food

143
00:14:09,334 --> 00:14:12,708
That lover-boy of her will bring
her goodies worth a million!

144
00:14:13,042 --> 00:14:15,624
He's going to pay a million
to take her away

145
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:20,750
Forget it. The mother-f...
How l get around to cursing!

146
00:14:21,292 --> 00:14:24,291
Forget about her boyfriend
and look at my husband

147
00:14:24,292 --> 00:14:29,250
He left that day and never returned.
- Rather than have such bastards...

148
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:31,957
l prefer the guys who come over
for a couple of hours...

149
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:34,291
''do their sin, pay their money
and leave quietly''

150
00:14:34,292 --> 00:14:37,624
God save us from such bastards!
in their greed for money...

151
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:41,624
they dump us in these
brothels forever

152
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:45,916
Skip the drama and eat the food.
He's left you here in our care

153
00:14:46,417 --> 00:14:49,584
To die! And you're weeping away.
Quietly eat it up

154
00:14:53,417 --> 00:14:54,584
Don't cry

155
00:14:55,334 --> 00:14:57,790
Bloody wenches!
Stop proving who you are!

156
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,790
Have you forgotten? This is just how
all of you arrived here too

157
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:03,624
How you used to weep!

158
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:06,249
What is your name?

159
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:11,249
Tell her your name.
Skip the melodrama

160
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,250
Muskaan

161
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:17,333
You have as faint a heart
as lovely as your name

162
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:20,708
Now wipe your tears
and spread a smile

163
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:25,333
Misfortune has brought you
to this marketplace already

164
00:15:25,334 --> 00:15:28,333
So forget about the world outside
and embrace this one

165
00:15:28,334 --> 00:15:31,583
No man has ever come to take away
a woman from these brothels

166
00:15:31,917 --> 00:15:35,250
Never. And that's our
biggest misfortune

167
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,875
Rakesh will surely come.
My Rakesh will surely arrive

168
00:15:40,292 --> 00:15:44,917
l believe more in Rakesh's promise
than l trust my own fate

169
00:15:46,292 --> 00:15:48,416
He will surely come

170
00:15:48,417 --> 00:15:51,459
''lf that's how it is, l too will
pray for him to come...''

171
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:54,333
and take you away

172
00:15:54,334 --> 00:15:58,333
How l wish a couple of
myths were shattered

173
00:15:58,334 --> 00:16:02,041
Do not worry.
I’m here with you

174
00:16:02,042 --> 00:16:05,209
''Where's that faggot Baldie...
- Softly, Shabbo...''

175
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:10,209
Why must l talk softly?
That rotten bastard!

176
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:13,249
''lf he comes here again,
I’m going to carve him to pieces!''

177
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:16,249
Whom?
- Move!

178
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:19,750
Who are you talking about?
- That blackie who oils his hair!

179
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,750
May the dogs get his mother!
He took me to a hotel

180
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:28,750
''He gave me a bride's attire;
l was his wife, he was my husband''

181
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,665
What an act!

182
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:34,791
''Don't laugh, Pooja!
My brains are ready to burst!''

183
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:38,291
His wife arrived there

184
00:16:38,292 --> 00:16:44,875
''And l was so scared, Allah...
l couldn't say a word''

185
00:16:45,334 --> 00:16:48,333
''She asked who l was.
And he said, l was his sister!''

186
00:16:48,334 --> 00:16:54,541
''And l said, bastard! You said you got
married. Heartiest congratulations!''

187
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,624
Then?
- As if I’d keep quiet

188
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:05,167
l spilt the beans and his wife
got down to thrashing him!

189
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:13,624
You can't stop laughing!

190
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:17,000
Who's this chick?
- No chick. This is Muskaan

191
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:21,875
''And this is Shabbo, my friend,
my confidante... everything''

192
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,708
''As hot-tempered as she appears to be,
she's equally soft at heart''

193
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:30,708
''Shabbo, Ali's here.
- Ali...? Tell him I’m coming''

194
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:38,417
So here comes her Romeo!

195
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:48,666
Where were you all these days?
- l was held up with some work

196
00:17:49,292 --> 00:17:50,250
Sit down

197
00:17:51,334 --> 00:17:54,249
Know what? The moment l see you...

198
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:57,375
l forget about all my sorrows
and my temper

199
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:03,540
Everyone here teases me!
They say that when Ali arrives...

200
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:07,875
Shabbo blossoms fully!
Like the arrival of the bee...

201
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:12,208
makes a bud blossom!

202
00:18:12,209 --> 00:18:16,333
And this bee comes to be held
captive by this bud

203
00:18:16,334 --> 00:18:19,541
l have just one desire.
To make this bud my own...

204
00:18:20,334 --> 00:18:25,792
and keep her in
the bouquet of my heart

205
00:19:08,292 --> 00:19:11,999
''Welcome, sir! Welcome!''

206
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,333
in the car!
The guy's bleeding money!

207
00:19:15,334 --> 00:19:19,665
''The sights begin here, sir''

208
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:22,875
''Splendid sights!
Welcome, sir, your lordship!''

209
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,792
I’ll show you some beauties
in this marketplace...

210
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:32,540
you'll find it difficult
to believe your eyes!

211
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:38,417
You must surely have
heard that English number?

212
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,792
''Whether you go to China,
France, Nigeria...''

213
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:49,209
the girls there just can't
compete with our beauties

214
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,291
The trumpet!

215
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:56,583
''Get a hold on yourself! Every time you
see some rascal, you start screaming''

216
00:19:56,917 --> 00:20:00,833
''Fakira, if l don't wreck
your trumpet some day...''

217
00:20:01,084 --> 00:20:03,083
l won't be Rangila!

218
00:20:03,084 --> 00:20:07,667
Rangila you are.
With stains on your reputation

219
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,332
''Whether you live or not,
your stains will live on''

220
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,374
''Before a customer,
why must you...?''

221
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:19,667
''This is how these guys are, sir!
But let's not waste time''

222
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:27,000
I’ll fix you later

223
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:44,333
Put that away.
And taste this one

224
00:20:49,667 --> 00:20:52,792
''New stock, sir.
Come and take a look''

225
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,999
Please be seated

226
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,999
''Sit, sit.
- He's sitting already''

227
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,250
I’m Gulabo

228
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:04,290
Talk in English

229
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:09,625
A sight of fairyland

230
00:21:12,959 --> 00:21:14,250
Darlings!

231
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:16,291
Look!

232
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:34,332
''Bored, darling...?
Wait till l join you''

233
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:37,583
And look at Rekha.
Take her

234
00:21:38,042 --> 00:21:42,874
You won't find one like her.
- Nice?

235
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:43,833
Nice

236
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:49,583
The son-in-law! Something tells me
things haven't clicked at all!

237
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:52,374
''Fairies, beat it!''

238
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:55,792
''Fly, get going!
Make way... move it!''

239
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:57,958
is something more to come?

240
00:21:57,959 --> 00:22:00,332
''This was a teaser,
the movie's still coming''

241
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:04,499
''So ring the bell, butterfly!''

242
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,708
Some people are
crazy about beauty...

243
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:12,457
absolutely mad about beauty!

244
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:16,000
So here are the fairies!
Look at Meenakshi

245
00:22:16,583 --> 00:22:19,290
Here's Jayapradha

246
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:22,583
''Take a look at the girls, sir!
- Some more movie to come?''

247
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:28,416
it’s an interval! The movie's
real fun after the interval

248
00:22:28,834 --> 00:22:33,290
Here goes the drama

249
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:34,583
Sir...

250
00:22:34,917 --> 00:22:37,332
''Lord, gentleman!
Where are you going?''

251
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:43,417
''Haven't liked anyone, hero?''

252
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,292
''So, handsome?
Forgot your wallet at home?''

253
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:56,042
Let's manage with credit today

254
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,125
Let him go

255
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:26,291
Didn't l tell you? No one returns
empty-handed from this marketplace!

256
00:23:26,542 --> 00:23:29,750
''lf someone does, it'll take the
colour out of Rangila's personality''

257
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,290
''The one you've settled for, sir...''

258
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:40,000
happens to be the most beautiful
flower in this rose garden

259
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:48,417
Let me say something
in her praise. She...

260
00:23:53,042 --> 00:23:56,707
The son-of-a-gun's eating up
a currency note

261
00:23:56,708 --> 00:23:59,874
''in this very marketplace, he'll
take a beating some day''

262
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:05,750
''Amen! Allah willing,
that's what will happen''

263
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:14,667
''Madam, neither are you my employee
nor am l your driver''

264
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:20,708
Sit in the front

265
00:24:24,959 --> 00:24:27,290
All right?
How about talking money now?

266
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:30,624
Money?
- Yes. Better decide the rate now

267
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:33,624
l don't like haggling later.
- So what is your rate?

268
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:37,082
3000 for a short time.
5000 for the full night

269
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:39,624
Are you carrying one?
- One?

270
00:24:39,625 --> 00:24:42,875
Don't feign ignorance. Lots of
diseases being passed around nowadays

271
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:46,290
l won't get into it
without that

272
00:24:46,291 --> 00:24:49,417
What language! I’d need
a pen of iron to write that

273
00:24:49,834 --> 00:24:52,582
What?
- Nothing. How dare l say something?

274
00:24:52,583 --> 00:24:57,875
Shall we go?
- Let's go

275
00:25:03,834 --> 00:25:06,249
Such an expensive hotel!

276
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:08,040
Listen... where are you going?

277
00:25:08,041 --> 00:25:12,749
Let's go to a hotel l know.
it’ll cost just a thousand rupees

278
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:18,292
C'mon.
- Listen...

279
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:55,917
Wow!

280
00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:01,208
This is fantastic!
l have my life made today!

281
00:26:05,917 --> 00:26:09,332
Sit down. I’ll freshen up
and join you soon

282
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:13,249
What style!

283
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,417
Great!

284
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:20,708
''Pooja, your life's made!''

285
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:33,084
This is real fun!

286
00:26:38,333 --> 00:26:40,624
''What are you doing?
- Stripping, of course''

287
00:26:40,625 --> 00:26:43,082
This is part of going to
a hotel with a man

288
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:46,584
But you needn't take off your clothes
if you have come here with me

289
00:26:47,292 --> 00:26:50,291
You've changed your mind?
Or don't you like me really?

290
00:26:50,292 --> 00:26:52,915
''Now look, mister.
We had settled on the price''

291
00:26:52,916 --> 00:26:56,207
l had told you that l hate to
haggle about things later

292
00:26:56,208 --> 00:27:00,125
But you seem to be a decent guy.
I’ll give you a discount of 500 rupees

293
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:04,207
''lf you ask me to simply go away,
I’ll collect the whole fee''

294
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:07,625
Not a penny less! l have
so many things to pay for

295
00:27:08,041 --> 00:27:10,708
''Anna's commission, Rangila's
cut, the rent...''

296
00:27:10,709 --> 00:27:14,291
''That's okay, but l brought you here
for something entirely different''

297
00:27:14,292 --> 00:27:17,583
What's entirely different?
What's the job?

298
00:27:17,584 --> 00:27:20,082
''You aren't shooting
a blue-film, are you?''

299
00:27:20,083 --> 00:27:22,791
I’m not into such things!

300
00:27:22,792 --> 00:27:24,957
''Please be seated first.
- Be seated, my foot!''

301
00:27:24,958 --> 00:27:29,000
''in our parlance, being seated
is to spread out like this''

302
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:33,249
This is what we call
being seated

303
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:36,249
''To begin with, stop
speaking that language''

304
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:39,416
To be seated is to sit down

305
00:27:39,417 --> 00:27:42,291
You will talk like me as long
as you're with me. Okay?

306
00:27:42,292 --> 00:27:46,332
Okay. So what's the job?

307
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:48,583
I’m a writer.
- What?

308
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:51,833
A writer. Who writes novels.
- So what am l to do?

309
00:27:52,833 --> 00:27:55,332
What a thick-skinned girl!
- What?

310
00:27:55,333 --> 00:27:56,292
Nothing

311
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:01,500
l want you to just stay with me
for ten days

312
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:05,499
I’ll compensate you
as you wish

313
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,541
''As you said, a single night
costs 5000 rupees''

314
00:28:08,542 --> 00:28:13,167
''That's 10000 rupees for a day
and 100,000 for ten days''

315
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:17,667
''I’ll pay you 200,000 rupees...
- 200,000...?''

316
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,249
You will only stay with me
for ten days

317
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:24,584
And what'll l have to do?
- Just stay with me

318
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,624
''200,000 to just stay with you?
- Yes''

319
00:28:27,625 --> 00:28:31,249
What guarantee that you will
indeed pay me the money?

320
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:32,459
One moment

321
00:28:41,292 --> 00:28:46,750
''Here's 100,000. The advance''

322
00:28:49,958 --> 00:28:52,291
is it genuine currency?
- What?

323
00:28:52,292 --> 00:28:58,375
Nothing.
- Now please go in and freshen up

324
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:06,459
So many men steal the money from
the under pillow and vanish

325
00:29:07,625 --> 00:29:13,125
Why take the risk?

326
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:18,624
What fun it is to have money!

327
00:29:18,625 --> 00:29:21,583
They turn the earth
into a paradise

328
00:29:21,584 --> 00:29:25,208
No sound from outside...
have you left already?

329
00:29:25,916 --> 00:29:30,249
I’m right here.
Where will l go?

330
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:35,832
l wasn't talking to you.
Please send what l asked for

331
00:29:35,833 --> 00:29:40,959
Let me take a bath!

332
00:30:37,417 --> 00:30:39,333
Go and wear some clothes

333
00:30:39,334 --> 00:30:41,665
But l am already clothed.
How much more will l wear?

334
00:30:41,666 --> 00:30:44,333
''lf this is being clothed,
what's nude?''

335
00:30:44,334 --> 00:30:46,291
Forget it. I’m famished

336
00:30:46,292 --> 00:30:48,583
''Wear your clothes, or l won't
let you touch a morsel of the food''

337
00:30:48,584 --> 00:30:54,792
But l haven't brought another set!
- Just a moment

338
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:57,041
Here you are

339
00:30:57,042 --> 00:30:58,999
Wear this. And tie the
towel on your head

340
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,625
''Else, you might catch a cold
- Big cold!''

341
00:31:14,417 --> 00:31:17,041
That's like a good girl.
You look good

342
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:18,000
Really?

343
00:31:19,292 --> 00:31:22,333
''When l say good, it means
from a distance''

344
00:31:22,334 --> 00:31:26,957
There's no need to get closer

345
00:31:26,958 --> 00:31:31,082
Hungry? Eat it up.
- Food?

346
00:31:31,083 --> 00:31:32,250
Wow!

347
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:35,665
May l? Why don't you have some?

348
00:31:35,666 --> 00:31:38,665
''lf you don't eat,
how will you write?''

349
00:31:38,666 --> 00:31:40,707
''I’ll surely eat,
if you leave something''

350
00:31:40,708 --> 00:31:46,792
Eat it up! l don't guarantee
I’ll leave something

351
00:31:50,666 --> 00:31:53,833
''So you take your sister's earning?
- Talk less, not more''

352
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,665
Else I’ll knock your teeth out. Okay?
- Get lost!

353
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:01,291
How about it?
- What will you take?

354
00:32:01,292 --> 00:32:03,665
2000.
- 2000?

355
00:32:03,666 --> 00:32:06,291
l asked only your rate.
Not the whole marketplace

356
00:32:06,292 --> 00:32:09,791
I’ll pay 200 bucks. How about it?
- Get going!

357
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,624
How about it?
- No

358
00:32:15,625 --> 00:32:20,624
Why?
- Bank holiday. Come after 5 days

359
00:32:20,625 --> 00:32:24,583
Lots of bank holidays nowadays.
Not a single working day!

360
00:32:27,292 --> 00:32:33,291
Give that to me.
- This is Rangila's share

361
00:32:33,292 --> 00:32:37,333
This is Anna's share

362
00:32:37,334 --> 00:32:40,333
This is for my expenses.
- How much? Show me

363
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:43,833
And this is for you

364
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,333
Once you get married and leave...

365
00:32:53,334 --> 00:32:59,041
I’ll be able
to breathe freely

366
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,957
Your ladyship! What do you want?

367
00:33:05,958 --> 00:33:09,916
''Ladyship, my foot!
it’s me''

368
00:33:09,917 --> 00:33:13,624
Allah! What a sight!

369
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:15,499
Curse Rangila's mother!

370
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,624
What's all this?
- Style... what else

371
00:33:18,625 --> 00:33:21,540
You hit the jackpot
in a single night?

372
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:25,333
No. l just happened to
come across an admirer

373
00:33:25,334 --> 00:33:29,250
''An admirer, or is he a foreigner?
- No, he's Indian''

374
00:33:30,958 --> 00:33:33,333
So what does he do?
- That's the best part

375
00:33:33,334 --> 00:33:36,541
He does nothing! He pays
for doing nothing

376
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:40,291
He pays for doing nothing!

377
00:33:40,292 --> 00:33:42,749
Here's the money.
- What's this?

378
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:46,708
Keep it.
- So much? Rather you keep it

379
00:33:47,083 --> 00:33:50,082
it’ll get stolen from me.
- Not for you...

380
00:33:50,083 --> 00:33:54,540
it's for your sister. Put it in
the kitty for her marriage

381
00:33:54,541 --> 00:34:01,041
What are you staring at me for?
isn’t she a sister to me also?

382
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:08,833
Save those tears. Let them flow
when you see your sister leave

383
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,999
Now what's wrong with you?

384
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,541
l have realized now

385
00:34:19,083 --> 00:34:22,291
Kindhearted folks live here too

386
00:34:22,292 --> 00:34:26,792
Everyone is humane. Just that
circumstances turn them into beasts

387
00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:34,000
''Times? Tonight is auspicious,
and l feel like dancing''

388
00:34:34,583 --> 00:34:38,500
''Of course. Tonight,
we'll sing and dance''

389
00:34:38,833 --> 00:34:41,999
''in this bazaar,
beauty will be extolled tonight''

390
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,458
So let's dance!
- Dance!

391
00:34:57,625 --> 00:35:01,832
l cast a variety of spells...

392
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:05,209
when l dress up to the do

393
00:35:06,708 --> 00:35:10,416
They talk about me...

394
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:14,458
in the marketplace of beauty

395
00:35:15,541 --> 00:35:18,041
They praise my bindis

396
00:35:18,042 --> 00:35:23,750

comes to power...''

my lips are juicy''

''Ever since l turned sixteen,
my gait has been sensuous''

405
00:37:10,833 --> 00:37:15,250

they also praise my earrings''

my beauty is hailed

410
00:38:15,583 --> 00:38:19,583
''My style is sensational,
my attitude is fatal''

they all are crazy for me''

They praise my bracelets

00:39:10,375 --> 00:39:15,416
''No matter what government
comes to power...''

423
00:39:15,917 --> 00:39:19,208
my beauty is hailed

424
00:39:50,959 --> 00:39:55,332
Where are you going?
- Upstairs. 701

425
00:39:55,333 --> 00:39:57,999
You can't go there.
- Why not?

426
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,332
You can't stop me.
l was there all night with him

427
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:03,999
My staff didn't stop you last night.
it was a mistake

428
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,291
We have to think about
other guests too

429
00:40:07,667 --> 00:40:10,457
''So do it, it's your duty.
Why stop me?''

430
00:40:10,458 --> 00:40:13,374
l told you! You can't go upstairs.
- Why not? Reason?

431
00:40:13,375 --> 00:40:16,791
Reason? Your type

432
00:40:16,792 --> 00:40:21,999
Get that? lf you want me
to put it straight...

433
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,250
And our hotel doesn't entertain
hookers like you

434
00:40:26,125 --> 00:40:29,792
''Yes, I’m a hooker.
You aren't a saint either''

435
00:40:30,333 --> 00:40:33,667
You are not an angel. it is
your types that visit us the most

436
00:40:34,042 --> 00:40:36,499
''Managers, leaders and officers,
during the day!''

437
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,875
And by night you come to lick our feet!
Cowards from a hypocrite society!

438
00:40:40,333 --> 00:40:45,459
l spit at your hotel!

439
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:58,375
What do they think of themselves?
Money makes them think they are Gods

440
00:40:59,417 --> 00:41:03,250
Had l someone to call my own...?
But alas!

441
00:41:05,041 --> 00:41:10,332
''Spare me a dime, my child.
- Sorry''

442
00:41:10,333 --> 00:41:13,834
Here... and tell your God
not to show us dreams

443
00:41:14,333 --> 00:41:17,082
''lf not, ask Him
not to shatter our dreams''

444
00:41:17,083 --> 00:41:22,833
''May God give you your wish, my child''

445
00:41:29,333 --> 00:41:30,874
Let's go.
- Where?

446
00:41:30,875 --> 00:41:33,040
To the hotel.
- Again?

447
00:41:33,041 --> 00:41:35,999
And get humiliated and abused again?

448
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,332
''I’m a whore but I’m not a beggar,
nor am l corrupt''

449
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:42,541
l can't stand abuses.
- You could've called me up

450
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:45,582
Called up?
He didn't even let me talk

451
00:41:45,583 --> 00:41:49,291
The bastard! He had me thrown out!
The swine

452
00:41:49,667 --> 00:41:52,332
I’ll kick him out.
Come with me

453
00:41:52,333 --> 00:41:53,624
I’m not going.
- Come on

454
00:41:53,625 --> 00:41:55,958
''No, l said.
- Come on, or I’ll slap you''

455
00:41:55,959 --> 00:41:59,290
You think I’m your wife?
Try touching me

456
00:41:59,291 --> 00:42:00,250
C'mon

457
00:42:04,291 --> 00:42:08,124
''Also apologize to the lady.
- I’m sorry, ma'am''

458
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:11,917
''I’m really sorry, sir.
We won't make this mistake again''

459
00:42:12,333 --> 00:42:14,916
l apologize to you on his behalf

460
00:42:14,917 --> 00:42:20,083
''l apologize, lady''

461
00:42:29,292 --> 00:42:32,917
''The bastard! He was raving.
Had l my way, I’d have killed him''

462
00:42:33,458 --> 00:42:37,667
You are as much at fault
as the manager

463
00:42:38,333 --> 00:42:41,583
''Your make-up, your dress,
your style''

464
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,292
Come to the point.
Why beat around the bush?

465
00:42:45,709 --> 00:42:48,999
I’m a whore. isn’t that
what you want to say?

466
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,416
''lf that's how you take it, fine.
- All right! I’m a whore''

467
00:42:52,417 --> 00:42:55,374
But what would you call those men
who wear a facade of decency...

468
00:42:55,375 --> 00:42:59,917
while they lust from inside?
it is we who sate their lust

469
00:43:00,458 --> 00:43:03,374
''Sir, if there are
no whores around...''

470
00:43:03,375 --> 00:43:07,375
womenfolk from decent families
would be raped in public

471
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:12,250
You must be grateful to us whores.
We drink the poison of lust

472
00:43:12,625 --> 00:43:16,040
While the elixir of happiness and
decency is what the society receives

473
00:43:16,041 --> 00:43:20,792
''lf we shut shop for two months,
your womenfolk will be in trouble''

474
00:43:21,333 --> 00:43:23,999
They will be kidnapped
in broad daylight

475
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,624
You talk well.
- in fact I’m telling you...

476
00:43:26,625 --> 00:43:30,332
the fact of life

477
00:43:30,333 --> 00:43:34,040
it is not that we like
to sell ourselves

478
00:43:34,041 --> 00:43:38,709
''Forget it. To gain sympathy,
you will spin a yarn now ;...''

479
00:43:40,292 --> 00:43:43,584
''circumstances at home forced you,
or someone conned you into it''

480
00:43:44,834 --> 00:43:47,457
''Old hat.
- You're happy, and circumstances...''

481
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:51,625
''haven't got the better of you, that's
why it's so easy for you to say that''

482
00:43:52,958 --> 00:43:57,625
it takes nothing to
watch someone drown in the sea

483
00:43:59,292 --> 00:44:02,457
''lf you dare,
try taking on a storm''

484
00:44:02,458 --> 00:44:06,750
Then you will know how the storm
changes your course of your life

485
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:10,999
Really? What storm
have you been through?

486
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,249
What do l tell you?

487
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:16,040
Even l had a happy family once

488
00:44:16,041 --> 00:44:20,000
''Father was a teacher,
and my mother was a housewife''

489
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,416
We were so happy that
sorrows seemed a falsehood

490
00:44:25,417 --> 00:44:30,040
Exactly like it is to you now

491
00:44:30,041 --> 00:44:33,417
Suddenly there was
this earthquake... the tremor...

492
00:44:36,292 --> 00:44:39,874
For a while the land rocked

493
00:44:39,875 --> 00:44:44,417
And the entire town
turned into a graveyard

494
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:50,542
''Mr. Writer, one moment, the town
was full of life, full of joys''

495
00:44:52,333 --> 00:44:54,416
And the next moment...

496
00:44:54,417 --> 00:44:58,167
''there was a pile of corpses,
death and grief''

497
00:45:01,041 --> 00:45:06,292
We endured so much

498
00:45:06,417 --> 00:45:10,375
Relief camps were set up everywhere

499
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,375
l found a young officer there...
he was very sympathetic

500
00:45:17,292 --> 00:45:23,082
He promised to marry me

501
00:45:23,083 --> 00:45:27,416
A poor girl is like a hungry bird...

502
00:45:27,417 --> 00:45:31,499
that goes to the one who feeds it

503
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:34,416
And l too fed
on the grain of deceit

504
00:45:34,417 --> 00:45:38,667
''Not a wife, he wanted
to turn me into a mint''

505
00:45:40,292 --> 00:45:43,416
''To please a minister,
he wanted me to sleep with him''

506
00:45:43,417 --> 00:45:48,250
''Mr. Writer, that was my fiancé,
supposed to become my husband''

507
00:45:49,459 --> 00:45:50,833
l refused

508
00:45:51,333 --> 00:45:55,709
''But helpless as l was,
the lustful minister raped me''

509
00:45:58,916 --> 00:46:01,040
And l figured one thing

510
00:46:01,041 --> 00:46:05,292
''Status notwithstanding, every man
is a wolf when it comes to women''

511
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,750
I’d rather charge for sating
their lust than be forced do it

512
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,999
''So l said, to hell with decency''

513
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,040
Then l wore a low-cut blouse
to reveal some cleavage...

514
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:21,459
and also put on a mini skirt
and started trading myself

515
00:46:21,833 --> 00:46:23,999
May l ask a question?

516
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,915
''You could've done a job, no?''

517
00:46:26,916 --> 00:46:31,375
A job? in a man's world women
get jobs only when they give in

518
00:46:32,042 --> 00:46:34,915
Not every man
is a decent chap like you

519
00:46:34,916 --> 00:46:38,875
A woman has to get laid
if she wants a job

520
00:46:40,333 --> 00:46:44,584
''When a man is possessed with lust,
he doesn't even spare a beggar woman''

521
00:46:44,958 --> 00:46:50,416
Would he spare a poor young girl?

522
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,167
The poor guy is putting
a lot of effort but in vain

523
00:47:01,875 --> 00:47:03,541
''Help him, Lord''

524
00:47:03,542 --> 00:47:08,584
''Hey slink, join hands with me''

525
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,584
Why must you waste your time
and Muskaan's prime?

526
00:47:13,958 --> 00:47:17,250
Trust me.
She is mind-blowing

527
00:47:17,625 --> 00:47:24,250
''Her beauty can fetch
a minimum of 50,000 per night''

528
00:47:26,292 --> 00:47:29,500
That comes to 1 .5 million a month

529
00:47:29,833 --> 00:47:33,291
''The million is yours, 500,000 is mine.
Anna keeps a 900,000 of yours...''

530
00:47:33,292 --> 00:47:36,333
''so you get to keep 100,000.
l have rich clients''

531
00:47:36,334 --> 00:47:39,708
''Tell me, should l call one now?''

532
00:47:42,417 --> 00:47:43,334
Hey!

533
00:47:50,459 --> 00:47:52,874
''Too smart, eh?''

534
00:47:52,875 --> 00:47:57,500
''l suggest you a business,
and you hit me, eh?''

535
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:58,750
Bastard!

536
00:48:00,334 --> 00:48:04,499
What are you doing?
- Bastard!

537
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:07,625
You sold off your mother and sister!
Don't think every girl is up for sale

538
00:48:08,208 --> 00:48:12,500
Reason with him.
I’ll have Muskaan deflowered!

539
00:48:12,833 --> 00:48:15,207
Swine!
- Watch your tongue!

540
00:48:15,208 --> 00:48:19,833
''Deflowered, eh? Say that again
and by God, I’ll kill you! Get lost''

541
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,459
''Don't worry, son. We're with you.
Go on... go''

542
00:48:39,459 --> 00:48:41,874
Now what makes you gloomy?

543
00:48:41,875 --> 00:48:45,957
What are you thinking of?

544
00:48:45,958 --> 00:48:49,957
''l promised you, Shabbo...''

545
00:48:49,958 --> 00:48:52,916
to make you my wife...

546
00:48:52,917 --> 00:48:56,874
and make a new world for ourselves

547
00:48:56,875 --> 00:49:00,291
Why bring that up all of a sudden?

548
00:49:00,292 --> 00:49:03,375
My wish seems to go out of reach

549
00:49:04,459 --> 00:49:08,041
My parents have found a girl for me

550
00:49:08,042 --> 00:49:11,208
But I’m not marrying her.
I’ll talk to them

551
00:49:11,625 --> 00:49:15,541
What will you tell them?
- I’ll tell them l won't marry her

552
00:49:15,875 --> 00:49:20,249
What excuse will you give them?

553
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:22,916
That I’m in love with Shabbo

554
00:49:22,917 --> 00:49:28,625
''What if they ask you about me,
my caste, my parents...''

555
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:33,582
my house... what will you tell them?

556
00:49:33,583 --> 00:49:38,249
''You will tell them that
I’m a whore, right?''

557
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:43,250
''Look Ali, a girl like me can be
someone's wife for a while or so''

558
00:49:43,833 --> 00:49:46,875
But she cannot live forever
as a daughter-in-law of some family

559
00:49:47,791 --> 00:49:51,250
''No! Mine is a different path,
and yours is a different world''

560
00:49:52,459 --> 00:49:57,417
''Henceforth, if you enter this place,
if you even step into this bazaar...''

561
00:50:00,292 --> 00:50:05,624
you will find me dead.
- But Shabbo...

562
00:50:05,625 --> 00:50:09,875
lf you even love me one bit...

563
00:50:12,125 --> 00:50:15,999
''l implore you,
don't come back here''

564
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,875
''lf you return, I’ll consider that
you never loved me''

565
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,124
''Why, Shabbo? Why?''

566
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:31,957
l have taken enough deceit in life

567
00:50:31,958 --> 00:50:35,041
l have endured enough cruelty

568
00:50:35,042 --> 00:50:41,458
But l can't take the curse
of helpless parents

569
00:50:42,042 --> 00:50:43,000
Go away

570
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:46,083
Go!

571
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:59,916
What's he doing with
a top-class whore?

572
00:50:59,917 --> 00:51:03,957
What are you watching?
- The changes

573
00:51:03,958 --> 00:51:07,291
You used to wolf down your food
with your hands

574
00:51:07,292 --> 00:51:12,625
And look at you now. Good.
One must change with time

575
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:18,041
''Provided, someone helps to
steer through circumstances''

576
00:51:18,042 --> 00:51:23,958
One needs courage
to alter circumstances

577
00:51:25,042 --> 00:51:29,832
What are you doing here?
Remember me?

578
00:51:29,833 --> 00:51:35,208
Where are you going?
- I’ll be right back

579
00:51:36,084 --> 00:51:38,874
May l sit here?

580
00:51:38,875 --> 00:51:43,708
You should've asked before you sat.
What you did amounts to impudence

581
00:51:45,334 --> 00:51:49,041
''Anyway, what's your problem?
- I’m Rana''

582
00:51:49,042 --> 00:51:50,042
So?

583
00:51:52,334 --> 00:51:54,540
That girl...
- So?

584
00:51:54,541 --> 00:51:56,916
She's exquisite.
- So?

585
00:51:56,917 --> 00:52:00,333
So? You can answer better than me

586
00:52:00,334 --> 00:52:03,832
You have always written
against women in your novels

587
00:52:03,833 --> 00:52:06,041
''With much bitterness, at that''

588
00:52:06,042 --> 00:52:09,333
And now you go around with a whore...
- How do you know she is a whore?

589
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:12,583
''One has to give vent to his anger.
But believe me, sir...''

590
00:52:12,958 --> 00:52:16,041
when l went to the bazaar
to take it out...

591
00:52:16,042 --> 00:52:19,291
only Pooja mesmerized me.
- Through with your nonsense?

592
00:52:19,292 --> 00:52:22,334
There's so much to say.
But it seems you care two hoots

593
00:52:23,292 --> 00:52:27,458
''Please leave, or I’ll have to forget
that I’m a writer and use my hands''

594
00:52:29,458 --> 00:52:33,333
''For the first time,
l see a fighter in a writer''

595
00:52:33,334 --> 00:52:36,291
Cut the crap and leave

596
00:52:36,292 --> 00:52:37,292
Why?

597
00:52:39,042 --> 00:52:41,832
I’m a free citizen
of an independent country. Get that?

598
00:52:41,833 --> 00:52:45,291
''l too am one, by coincidence''

599
00:52:45,292 --> 00:52:50,250
''And, your independence ends
where it begins for me''

600
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,209
''Whether l bed her or write a novel,
it's none of your bloody business''

601
00:53:22,917 --> 00:53:25,290
What are you watching?

602
00:53:25,291 --> 00:53:29,667
The city.
it looks so peaceful from here

603
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:34,833
''However, it conceals so many tremors
of the flesh trade''

604
00:53:36,291 --> 00:53:40,375
''Someone is abusing,
someone is listening to it''

605
00:53:41,875 --> 00:53:45,792
''Someone is causing harm,
someone is enduring the pain''

606
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:48,416
l know

607
00:53:50,667 --> 00:53:54,290
l saw the abuses in that chap's eyes

608
00:53:54,291 --> 00:53:58,667
''Let alone his eyes,
had he even voiced his abuses...''

609
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:02,958
I’d have borne it

610
00:54:02,959 --> 00:54:07,249
I’ve gotten used to it

611
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:11,083
But l didn't want
to be humiliated before you

612
00:54:11,084 --> 00:54:15,833
And l can't take it if somebody
points a finger at you before me

613
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:22,750
Why?
- I’m trying to find the answer

614
00:54:25,291 --> 00:54:29,290
No idea where the answer lies

615
00:54:29,291 --> 00:54:34,459
l wonder if there is an answer

616
00:56:42,917 --> 00:56:44,291
Pooja...

617
00:56:45,917 --> 00:56:50,041
it's been ten days now

618
00:56:50,042 --> 00:56:55,916
And these ten days passed so quickly
as if they were ten seconds

619
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,125
''Pooja, our contract ends today''

620
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:10,167
Here's the rest of the money

621
00:57:14,291 --> 00:57:18,750
Shall we...?

622
00:57:28,959 --> 00:57:32,375
Where are we going?
- To drop you at the bazaar

623
00:57:33,042 --> 00:57:37,750
No. You took me away from
the bazaar... it was a good feeling

624
00:57:38,959 --> 00:57:42,375
l won't like it if you were
to personally drop me back

625
00:57:43,291 --> 00:57:48,875
Pull over. I’ll go by myself

626
00:57:53,959 --> 00:57:58,249
You want to say something?
- Never mind

627
00:57:58,250 --> 00:58:02,916
Your look tells me
you wish to say something

628
00:58:02,917 --> 00:58:07,667
The days l spent with you were
the most beautiful moments of my life

629
00:58:08,959 --> 00:58:13,375
''And as long as l live, they shall
live somewhere in my memories''

630
00:58:13,834 --> 00:58:14,834
Thank you

631
00:58:47,291 --> 00:58:51,833
Here... wipe your tears

632
00:58:51,834 --> 00:58:54,207
You can stand here and shed tears...

633
00:58:54,208 --> 00:58:57,290
but you can't speak your heart out

634
00:58:57,291 --> 00:59:00,624
''Go on, wipe your tears''

635
00:59:00,625 --> 00:59:01,583
Go on

636
00:59:02,958 --> 00:59:06,792
l lost my mind for a while.
Couldn't you have grabbed my neck...

637
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:11,625
''and asked me,
Do you take me for a plaything?''

638
00:59:11,958 --> 00:59:14,374
''For experience's sake, you kept me
with you for ten days...''

639
00:59:14,375 --> 00:59:17,542
''taught me lessons in decency,
changed my life...''

640
00:59:17,917 --> 00:59:20,249
''changed my heart, my mind,
my thoughts...''

641
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:23,249
''gave me a new lease of life
in this world...''

642
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:27,208
''made me bold enough to turn down
any man, let alone spend a night''

643
00:59:27,875 --> 00:59:31,375
''And today, you are again
dumping me in the hell-hole''

644
00:59:31,875 --> 00:59:34,957
Couldn't you have told me?
Can't you speak?

645
00:59:34,958 --> 00:59:35,792
No

646
00:59:36,292 --> 00:59:39,249
''l can't.
- Fine, wipe your tears''

647
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:40,833
How about some tea?
Cold drink?

648
00:59:40,834 --> 00:59:41,999
Juice?
- Nothing

649
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,499
Bhel?
- No

650
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:44,624
Ice-cream?
- No

651
00:59:44,625 --> 00:59:47,249
Will you marry me?

652
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:50,249
Answer me. Will you marry me?

653
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:52,249
But...
- No ifs and buts

654
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:54,499
My lexicon has no place
for those words

655
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:56,915
l want a straight answer
for my simple question

656
00:59:56,916 --> 00:59:59,040
But...
- Not again!

657
00:59:59,041 --> 01:00:02,333
''Either yes, or no''

658
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,291
Yes...
- Why sway your head?

659
01:00:05,292 --> 01:00:07,583
Yes!
- That's like it

660
01:00:07,584 --> 01:00:12,250
''Try as much as you will,
but the heart is beyond reasoning''

661
01:00:13,458 --> 01:00:18,250
''Only the heart knows
how it feels''

662
01:00:18,667 --> 01:00:23,250
Strange is Godliness

663
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:29,750
''Only Love knows
what love is all about''

664
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:53,375
''I’m restless.
Peace went beyond reach...''

665
01:00:54,417 --> 01:00:58,208
''ever since
love walked into my life''

666
01:01:09,625 --> 01:01:14,667
Romance gave me a strange high...

667
01:01:15,375 --> 01:01:19,417
''ever since
love walked into my life''

668
01:02:10,125 --> 01:02:14,584
''May no one suffer this ailment
of the heart''

669
01:02:15,709 --> 01:02:20,250
Solitude just kills me

670
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:25,584
''Love gives me
a strange feeling of anxiety''

671
01:02:26,292 --> 01:02:30,958
Passion torments me every moment

672
01:02:37,333 --> 01:02:41,833
''l can see nothing
even in daylight...''

673
01:02:42,916 --> 01:02:46,709
''ever since
love walked into my life''

674
01:03:26,958 --> 01:03:31,667
''Joys and sorrows
are part of life''

675
01:03:32,292 --> 01:03:36,875
''it takes obsession
to endure sorrows''

676
01:03:37,791 --> 01:03:42,584
l have no complaints against you

677
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:47,584
My life is meant for you

678
01:03:53,916 --> 01:03:58,250
''Joy takes the life
out of me...''

679
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:03,542
''ever since
love walked into my life''

680
01:04:09,708 --> 01:04:14,292
''I’m restless.
Peace went beyond reach...''

681
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:20,459
romance gave me a strange high...

682
01:04:20,875 --> 01:04:24,666
''ever since
love walked into my life''

683
01:04:35,334 --> 01:04:39,915
''Easy, Pooja.
- Careful''

684
01:04:39,916 --> 01:04:43,500
''So Pooja, are you going to marry?''

685
01:04:44,292 --> 01:04:47,833
''Well Anna, did she give you
in writing that she won't marry?''

686
01:04:49,083 --> 01:04:51,333
Don't interfere

687
01:04:51,334 --> 01:04:55,167
''Else, I’ll break your legs.
- l spit on you''

688
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,791
''Hear this much from me, Pooja''

689
01:05:00,292 --> 01:05:04,750
''The flowers bedecked on the palanquin
of the bazaar, barely smell''

690
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:11,208
Either the man leaves his wife
after his nuptial-night

691
01:05:11,833 --> 01:05:15,833
''Or, he dumps her again in the bazaar
for fear of ostracism''

692
01:05:16,334 --> 01:05:20,749
Mark my words

693
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,875
''As far as l know Manav,
he is not that type''

694
01:05:24,334 --> 01:05:27,499
''Besides, everyone must die some day''

695
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:31,582
But you can't stop living
for the fear of death

696
01:05:31,583 --> 01:05:33,999
Long Live Pooja

697
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,458
''What say, Anna? You got an answer?
- Sure''

698
01:05:37,459 --> 01:05:40,082
I’ll say this before everyone here

699
01:05:40,083 --> 01:05:46,250
Were she my property
and dared to talk back...

700
01:05:46,917 --> 01:05:52,250
I’d have hacked her to pieces
and fed her to the vultures

701
01:05:52,833 --> 01:05:57,666
''But thank her stars,
she only works for me''

702
01:05:58,625 --> 01:06:05,375
''Pooja, I’ll pray to God. May He never
make your husband abandon you''

703
01:06:05,958 --> 01:06:10,209
But God will certainly do that

704
01:06:11,042 --> 01:06:15,875
Your man will certainly abandon you.
Do remember your good old Anna then

705
01:06:16,917 --> 01:06:21,625
''For you, Anna's door will be
open round the clock''

706
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:26,334
''Do come back,
but while you are still young''

707
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,416
Because it's the rule of the bazaar

708
01:06:29,417 --> 01:06:35,250
The bazaar welcomes
only youth and beauty

709
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,999
Another thing

710
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,375
Stale food won't do here

711
01:06:41,917 --> 01:06:45,541
Sagging bodies won't do.
in case you sag...

712
01:06:46,083 --> 01:06:52,417
you'd rather go and kill yourself
than come here

713
01:06:52,833 --> 01:06:56,249
Anna! May your tongue burn!

714
01:06:56,250 --> 01:06:57,209
Let's go!

715
01:07:09,250 --> 01:07:14,250
Please bring the wedding garland

716
01:07:22,292 --> 01:07:27,750
Who will give the bride away?

717
01:07:27,875 --> 01:07:28,875
l will

718
01:07:32,083 --> 01:07:38,041
Who else will
when her father is still alive?

719
01:07:46,625 --> 01:07:52,125
Please stand up for taking rounds
around the holy fire

720
01:08:46,416 --> 01:08:52,250
''Thank you, Lord.
You have showered mercy on us''

721
01:08:54,625 --> 01:08:58,917
You have lit up this hell-spot
with hope and honour

722
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,791
''Please, Lord...''

723
01:09:05,792 --> 01:09:11,209
let this light spread all over
the bazaar. All over the bazaar

724
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:17,292
it’s an impossible dream

725
01:09:18,292 --> 01:09:20,999
Pooja is gone. So what?

726
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,416
This slink here will bring up
hundred more Pooja’s

727
01:09:24,875 --> 01:09:28,249
And listen.
lf this bazaar shines...

728
01:09:28,250 --> 01:09:32,792
it will only be with
the sleazy lights here. You dig?

729
01:09:33,917 --> 01:09:38,209
''As long as I’m alive,
this bazaar won't wind up''

730
01:09:38,792 --> 01:09:44,916
it’s a promise

731
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:33,041
Who made this up?

732
01:10:33,042 --> 01:10:36,332
Who else? l did it myself

733
01:10:36,333 --> 01:10:39,332
''Really?
- Yes, Pooja''

734
01:10:39,333 --> 01:10:42,999
When l decided
to make you my wife...

735
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:47,875
l bought a book.
How To Make Marriage Work

736
01:10:49,625 --> 01:10:54,374
''Parents, siblings, relatives...
l have no one who'd do this for me''

737
01:10:54,375 --> 01:10:55,375
Come on

738
01:11:03,917 --> 01:11:08,250
When l used to shun a writer's pride
and lie down like a common man...

739
01:11:09,291 --> 01:11:12,583
''the walls, the windows and the doors
would often ask me...''

740
01:11:13,875 --> 01:11:17,999
''When will the mistress
of this house arrive?''

741
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,999
And l used to say it was impossible

742
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,290
There was no place for women
in my life

743
01:11:25,291 --> 01:11:28,667
''Like the others, my ears
were filled with treachery too''

744
01:11:31,833 --> 01:11:35,708
My life was a one-seater vehicle
that had no space for another

745
01:11:38,416 --> 01:11:41,583
''But you, and your love...''

746
01:11:42,959 --> 01:11:46,582
l don't know when
it created space for another

747
01:11:46,583 --> 01:11:50,332
l run short of words
to describe my joy

748
01:11:50,333 --> 01:11:53,875
l feel like spending
the rest of my life at your feet

749
01:11:55,875 --> 01:11:59,290
A woman like me...
- Hush. Pooja...

750
01:11:59,291 --> 01:12:02,332
let bygones be bygones

751
01:12:02,333 --> 01:12:07,583
Wipe out the past
like a child wipes his slate

752
01:12:09,125 --> 01:12:13,500
''Rewrite destiny. From now on,
you are only Manav's wife''

753
01:12:14,458 --> 01:12:19,083
No other identity. Right?

754
01:12:19,084 --> 01:12:22,917
''Pooja, l have never seen you
from so close''

755
01:12:25,291 --> 01:12:28,583
l feel immense love for you...
I’m so happy

756
01:12:57,416 --> 01:13:00,290
What are you watching?

757
01:13:00,291 --> 01:13:03,415
The first morn of my life

758
01:13:03,416 --> 01:13:07,415
How do you find it?
- Exotic

759
01:13:07,416 --> 01:13:11,541
But not as pretty as you

760
01:13:11,542 --> 01:13:17,000
''Pooja, you have changed my opinion''

761
01:13:18,084 --> 01:13:21,457
''l used to think a woman is a shame,
treacherous...''

762
01:13:21,458 --> 01:13:25,290
and the root cause of all problems

763
01:13:25,291 --> 01:13:28,124
And that's what I’ve been
witnessing since childhood

764
01:13:28,125 --> 01:13:31,291
''As a child, l got to know
that it was my mother who dumped me''

765
01:13:34,042 --> 01:13:39,041
People called me vermin

766
01:13:39,042 --> 01:13:42,290
''One fine day, a woman took pity on me,
picked me up from the street...''

767
01:13:42,291 --> 01:13:47,500
and took me to her house. l was elated
l thought l had found my mother

768
01:13:49,333 --> 01:13:53,792
''But that woman,
who masqueraded as a devoted wife...''

769
01:13:56,417 --> 01:14:01,082
dragged me on to her bed one day...

770
01:14:01,083 --> 01:14:04,999
and got the better of me

771
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:10,417
Nothing was as disparaging as that

772
01:14:11,333 --> 01:14:17,208
She kept on kissing me... it was
like a sharp blade piercing my body

773
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:21,290
l was so enraged
that l shoved her away

774
01:14:21,291 --> 01:14:25,916
Her head banged on a wall

775
01:14:25,917 --> 01:14:31,624
Then she framed me for theft
and sent me behind bars

776
01:14:31,625 --> 01:14:35,999
''in jail, l studied.
l studied hard''

777
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:41,500
l wanted to pen down the black deeds
of women and unmask them

778
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:48,459
And l had been doing just that...

779
01:14:48,709 --> 01:14:53,207
until l met you

780
01:14:53,208 --> 01:14:57,874
''And now l feel that,
if not for women...''

781
01:14:57,875 --> 01:15:01,457
life wouldn't have been so beautiful

782
01:15:01,458 --> 01:15:02,375
Thank you

783
01:15:05,542 --> 01:15:08,290
''Hammer it there!
And you, woman...''

784
01:15:08,291 --> 01:15:11,040
stick those two banners up there

785
01:15:11,041 --> 01:15:15,583
''And you... man,
sweep it clean. it’s so dirty''

786
01:15:15,959 --> 01:15:19,959
Don't clean me!
Oh no! it stinks

787
01:15:21,291 --> 01:15:25,750
''Damn, this gutter! Damn the vermin!
it stinks''

788
01:15:26,250 --> 01:15:29,834
l wonder how these paupers live here

789
01:15:30,375 --> 01:15:32,999
it’s fine now

790
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,999
Mr. Rangila...
- Aw! What is it?

791
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:40,792
''No matter how rich a man is,
he must not forget his doings''

792
01:15:41,292 --> 01:15:44,416
''Shut up!
Mind your own business, fatso''

793
01:15:44,417 --> 01:15:48,625
''Sure, sir. But l wish to know
why the place is being cleaned up''

794
01:15:49,041 --> 01:15:52,082
You don't know?
Tomorrow is Aids Day

795
01:15:52,083 --> 01:15:55,291
Aids...? What's that?
- Hear that!

796
01:15:55,292 --> 01:15:58,834
You don't that?
it’s a fatal disease

797
01:15:59,375 --> 01:16:04,375
Those men who come to this bazaar
and have sex with the whores...

798
01:16:04,792 --> 01:16:08,709
''that too without protection...
l mean, without condoms...''

799
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:11,874
l see.
- they are prone to this disease

800
01:16:11,875 --> 01:16:17,625
''They eventually writhe in pain,
suffer to their deaths''

801
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:21,625
''in that case, you must be
already suffering from it''

802
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,375
Shut up! You talk nonsense.
Bloody fool

803
01:16:26,250 --> 01:16:31,625
''That hurt you. What l meant is,
you've been a pimp since childhood...''

804
01:16:32,041 --> 01:16:35,584
''you are old now, you've been
whore-mongering since so long...''

805
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,875
''so you should be infected.
- Shut up! Swine, keep it low''

806
01:16:40,375 --> 01:16:43,625
''You want it to come
in the papers tomorrows, eh?''

807
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,792
Oh no. l just want to ask you...
did you bathe today?

808
01:16:48,292 --> 01:16:51,040
No. Why?
- You aren't cleansed yourself

809
01:16:51,041 --> 01:16:54,207
So why the cleanliness drive?

810
01:16:54,208 --> 01:16:56,915
I’ll slipper you!
- Please don't

811
01:16:56,916 --> 01:17:00,750
The minister is visiting tomorrow.
- l see

812
01:17:01,417 --> 01:17:06,916
He's touring on his helicopter. That's
why I’m having this place cleaned up

813
01:17:07,584 --> 01:17:12,875
Fine. But who will clean the souls
that are dirtier than the gutters?

814
01:17:13,875 --> 01:17:16,957
''Who are you hinting at, Fakira?''

815
01:17:16,958 --> 01:17:21,417
''Look, if you think l meant you,
then you are wrong''

816
01:17:21,916 --> 01:17:24,957
''Actually, it is you I’m hinting at.
- Oh, l see''

817
01:17:24,958 --> 01:17:28,916
''Brother Fakira,
don't joke with Mr. Rangila''

818
01:17:29,417 --> 01:17:33,542
He's not the same old Rangila.
He stands tall. Up there

819
01:17:33,958 --> 01:17:37,249
Up there? When will he go?
- l didn't mean that

820
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:41,792
''What l meant is, he has connections
right up there, with ministers''

821
01:17:42,292 --> 01:17:45,625
''Hardly matters. On the ground,
or on top of a mountain...''

822
01:17:45,958 --> 01:17:49,916
''no matter where an ass stands,
he's still called ass. What say?''

823
01:17:53,250 --> 01:17:57,374
Those who are
infected with Aids...

824
01:17:57,375 --> 01:18:03,208
''must be loved, must be taken care of.
They need your love''

825
01:18:04,250 --> 01:18:06,915
Don't hate them

826
01:18:06,916 --> 01:18:10,750
''Loving them, embracing them,
eating with them...''

827
01:18:11,208 --> 01:18:14,542
does not spread this disease

828
01:18:15,958 --> 01:18:18,957
This is not a disease
of the untouchables

829
01:18:18,958 --> 01:18:22,833
And our minister here
will prove that

830
01:18:23,417 --> 01:18:27,750
''He will shake hands with them,
take photographs with them...''

831
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:30,249
he will also embrace them

832
01:18:30,250 --> 01:18:31,875
Come here

833
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:35,957
''Please, Mr. Minister''

834
01:18:35,958 --> 01:18:41,499
Give me the garland

835
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:43,250

836
01:18:44,417 --> 01:18:47,249
''You got them examined, didn't you?
They aren't infected, are they?''

837
01:18:47,250 --> 01:18:51,667
They aren't. I’m not a fool

838
01:18:52,292 --> 01:18:56,791
The infected ones who the so-called
social workers take photographs with...

839
01:18:57,250 --> 01:19:00,709
they are really infected.
They are smalltime actors

840
01:19:02,250 --> 01:19:05,542
''Mr. Minister, he is conning you''

841
01:19:05,875 --> 01:19:09,708
How come?
- Those girls are not infected

842
01:19:09,709 --> 01:19:13,708
The infected ones are over there.
- He is right

843
01:19:13,709 --> 01:19:15,749
What?
- True

844
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:18,833
He won't let them come up on stage.
Please summon them up there

845
01:19:21,041 --> 01:19:25,249
''Come on, children,
Rangila's sisters...''

846
01:19:25,250 --> 01:19:27,541
''go on stage, to your father''

847
01:19:27,542 --> 01:19:29,583
Why are you calling them?

848
01:19:29,584 --> 01:19:31,957
''This function was organized
for their sake, isn't it?''

849
01:19:31,958 --> 01:19:35,999
Clear out the fake ones
and summon the real ones

850
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,249
''What's going on, Rangila?''

851
01:19:39,250 --> 01:19:43,833
What the...?

852
01:19:45,250 --> 01:19:47,999
''Mr. Manav, why did you stop writing?''

853
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,542
''Can't help it. Neither my pen, nor
my brain works. What do l write then?''

854
01:19:52,375 --> 01:19:55,791
''Ever since you stopped writing,
my business has been slack''

855
01:19:56,333 --> 01:19:59,791
Your fans too are waiting
for your next novel

856
01:20:01,125 --> 01:20:02,042
Anyway...

857
01:20:04,042 --> 01:20:07,291
here's the royalty cheque
for your previous novels

858
01:20:07,292 --> 01:20:10,791
it might make
your pen and brain work

859
01:20:11,292 --> 01:20:12,250
Thank you

860
01:20:12,958 --> 01:20:16,791
''Have breakfast, sir.
- No, thanks lady. I’m in a hurry''

861
01:20:17,292 --> 01:20:20,958
''Lady, you must urge him to write''

862
01:20:21,584 --> 01:20:25,332
''Else, his fame and his works
will be in danger''

863
01:20:25,333 --> 01:20:26,250
Bye

864
01:20:30,042 --> 01:20:36,042
He's right.
- Pooja!

865
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:40,915
''How are you, Pooja?
- How've you been?''

866
01:20:40,916 --> 01:20:42,665
I’m enjoying.
- Come in

867
01:20:42,666 --> 01:20:43,625
Hang on...

868
01:20:45,292 --> 01:20:47,333
Greetings.
- Greetings. How are you?

869
01:20:47,334 --> 01:20:50,333
I’m fine. Absolutely fine

870
01:20:50,334 --> 01:20:53,374
''Actually, l came to invite you folks
to my sister's wedding''

871
01:20:53,375 --> 01:20:57,584
''Your sister? She is not my sister, eh?
- Oh no, she is your sister''

872
01:20:57,958 --> 01:21:02,291
''Not an invite, brothers
are given responsibilities''

873
01:21:02,292 --> 01:21:04,999
it is the brother
who carries her palanquin

874
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:08,250
True.
- We'll certainly come. We'll enjoy

875
01:21:09,042 --> 01:21:09,958
Come on in

876
01:21:23,916 --> 01:21:27,584
Hats off to Shabbo. Not even landlords
give such a grand wedding

877
01:21:30,083 --> 01:21:32,749
I’m proud of my daughter Shabbo

878
01:21:32,750 --> 01:21:35,875
''She reared her brothers,
got them educated...''

879
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:39,875
''got them married, and she is even
looking after their household expenses''

880
01:21:41,042 --> 01:21:45,584
She is amazing. May God grant
everyone a daughter like her

881
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:51,333
What does Shabbo do in the city?

882
01:21:51,334 --> 01:21:56,750
The bridegroom's here
with the entourage

883
01:22:07,042 --> 01:22:12,333
As salaam Aleikom.
- Waleikom salaam

884
01:22:13,042 --> 01:22:16,957
Get the milk

885
01:22:16,958 --> 01:22:22,208
''Son, please show your face''

886
01:22:30,625 --> 01:22:35,417
Ali...?
- Shabbo...?

887
01:22:44,708 --> 01:22:49,875
What's the matter?
- No idea

888
01:22:53,250 --> 01:22:56,958
''What farce is this, Shabbo?
Your sister's bridegroom is here...''

889
01:22:57,417 --> 01:23:00,625
and you come running inside...
what would people think?

890
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:04,832
To hell with people.
Can't you see?

891
01:23:04,833 --> 01:23:09,249
Ali is marrying my sister

892
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:12,458
''l shared a relationship with Ali,
you know that''

893
01:23:12,459 --> 01:23:17,458
Allah!
Curse my destiny!

894
01:23:17,459 --> 01:23:21,333
What if my sister finds out...?

895
01:23:21,334 --> 01:23:24,333
How will l face her?

896
01:23:24,334 --> 01:23:28,291
No time to think about such things

897
01:23:28,292 --> 01:23:33,583
''The wedding can't be stopped,
you can't complain either''

898
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,957
Let it happen the way it is.
- No...

899
01:23:37,958 --> 01:23:40,582
''Let alone your sister,
no one will ever know...''

900
01:23:40,583 --> 01:23:45,333
what relationship you shared
with Ali in the marketplace

901
01:23:45,334 --> 01:23:49,041
l see.
- So this is it

902
01:23:49,042 --> 01:23:52,458
l won't go into details

903
01:23:52,459 --> 01:23:58,291
l sacrificed my love
for the sake of my sisters

904
01:23:58,292 --> 01:24:01,916
Anyway... put everything behind you

905
01:24:01,917 --> 01:24:05,250
And try not to give anyone
a chance to suspect

906
01:24:05,125 --> 01:24:07,874
''What am l being told, Shamsu?''

907
01:24:07,875 --> 01:24:11,041
is this what your daughter
is doing in the city?

908
01:24:11,042 --> 01:24:13,124
She's selling her body!

909
01:24:13,125 --> 01:24:14,665
Goodness me!

910
01:24:14,666 --> 01:24:18,582
And you thrust her sister
on our son?

911
01:24:18,583 --> 01:24:24,167
''You have humiliated me in everyone's
presence, here at the wedding!''

912
01:24:24,583 --> 01:24:28,457
You have abused me!
You have spat at me!

913
01:24:28,458 --> 01:24:32,417
No child in the world must've cast
such a slur on her parents' name!

914
01:24:33,875 --> 01:24:36,249
By getting into such a
repulsive profession...

915
01:24:36,250 --> 01:24:39,874
you wanted to have
your sister married off?

916
01:24:39,875 --> 01:24:44,833
Do you want your sister's family to be
ruined even before she settles down?

917
01:24:45,250 --> 01:24:48,917
lf you have any love
and respect for her...

918
01:24:49,375 --> 01:24:52,249
if you have any sympathy for her...

919
01:24:52,250 --> 01:24:55,917
''if you have any sense of shame
and modesty, get out of my sight!''

920
01:24:56,167 --> 01:25:00,624
Go away!
- l will go away

921
01:25:00,625 --> 01:25:02,999
''l will go away, but just let
this marriage be solemnized''

922
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,415
''lf you stay here, this marriage
is not going to be solemnized''

923
01:25:05,416 --> 01:25:07,832
I’ll take my son Ali
and leave immediately

924
01:25:07,833 --> 01:25:11,540
''Hear that, cursed girl?
Go away! Shame on you!''

925
01:25:11,541 --> 01:25:14,166
''You're neither my sister from today,
nor am l your brother''

926
01:25:14,167 --> 01:25:17,665
You have no parents.
You aren't their daughter anymore!

927
01:25:17,666 --> 01:25:20,208
Don't set foot in this
village ever again

928
01:25:20,209 --> 01:25:25,500
''lf you try to come back here,
I’ll bury you alive!''

929
01:25:26,292 --> 01:25:28,540
Go away! Get lost!

930
01:25:28,541 --> 01:25:31,249
But this is injustice!
- You have no right...

931
01:25:31,250 --> 01:25:34,875
''to speak in our family matters.
And those that speak, we throw...''

932
01:25:35,209 --> 01:25:39,875
Oh yes! Another word from you and...
Shabbo's not staying here anyway

933
01:25:40,875 --> 01:25:43,208
''Let's go, Pooja. Come on!''

934
01:25:43,209 --> 01:25:46,166
''Shabbo, listen to me.
- They are stone-hearted!''

935
01:25:46,167 --> 01:25:49,250
''They can't understand anyone's
feelings! Let's go, Pooja''

936
01:25:49,917 --> 01:25:50,833
C'mon!

937
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:00,708
''Now look, she has left with
the burden of her sins''

938
01:26:01,917 --> 01:26:06,833
But why should my poor innocent
daughter be punished for what she did?

939
01:26:07,875 --> 01:26:11,874
Please say something

940
01:26:11,875 --> 01:26:16,292
So what are we to do?
- That which we came here for

941
01:26:16,958 --> 01:26:20,500
There's an offer from a big guy.
For an item dance

942
01:26:21,667 --> 01:26:25,416
What's the budget like?
- Tall! it’s a huge budget

943
01:26:25,875 --> 01:26:28,958
''They'll pay over 100,000 anyway.
But they have a condition''

944
01:26:29,292 --> 01:26:33,833
The condition is that he needs an
absolutely fresh girl. New girl

945
01:26:34,875 --> 01:26:35,833
Anna...

946
01:26:37,875 --> 01:26:41,209
suppose I’m willing to do
this dance...

947
01:26:41,541 --> 01:26:44,374
will you adjust this money
in Rakesh's account?

948
01:26:44,375 --> 01:26:47,583
Good Lord! Jolly good!

949
01:26:52,917 --> 01:26:56,458
''There's nothing fishy, is there?
- What fishy...?''

950
01:26:56,959 --> 01:27:01,541
''Not at all! These guys who get the
item-numbers done, are decent folks''

951
01:27:01,750 --> 01:27:04,290
The main guy is a family man

952
01:27:04,291 --> 01:27:08,375
He has a daughter too.
As charming and beautiful as you are

953
01:27:09,125 --> 01:27:12,540
He's just been married

954
01:27:12,541 --> 01:27:15,833
it’s because of the tension that
he's getting this dance performed

955
01:27:18,917 --> 01:27:23,167
The heart's a magnet

956
01:27:28,333 --> 01:27:34,333
''Stick, stick... it does''

957
01:28:02,541 --> 01:28:05,916
''Every lover is bowled over
by my charms''

958
01:28:05,917 --> 01:28:09,125
''Goodness! What an offense
youthfulness is''

959
01:28:09,458 --> 01:28:12,833
''How it torments me
all day and night...''

960
01:28:13,125 --> 01:28:19,584
''the heart's a magnet,
it gets stuck''

961
01:28:19,959 --> 01:28:26,000
''Oh my God!
The things that happen to me''

962
01:28:27,416 --> 01:28:33,791
''The heart's a magnet,
it gets stuck''

963
01:29:02,875 --> 01:29:06,083
''l can't take these
cursed distances anymore''

964
01:29:06,084 --> 01:29:09,583
''Like an intoxication,
it clouds my heart''

965
01:29:10,042 --> 01:29:13,332
A magnet... this heart is

966
01:29:13,333 --> 01:29:18,958
So silly... this heart is

967
01:29:23,875 --> 01:29:27,332
it sets my breath on fire

968
01:29:27,333 --> 01:29:30,834
''the heart's a magnet,
it gets stuck''

969
01:29:34,166 --> 01:29:40,666
''Oh my God!
The things that happen to me''

970
01:29:41,834 --> 01:29:48,292
''The heart's a magnet,
it gets stuck''

971
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:16,958
it’s overwhelmed by desire

972
01:30:16,959 --> 01:30:20,375
''There's no saying when
one might lose his heart''

973
01:30:20,625 --> 01:30:26,542
A magnet... this heart is

974
01:30:34,875 --> 01:30:38,249
''it stokes the fires
in my heart''

975
01:30:38,250 --> 01:30:41,500
''The heart's a magnet,
it gets stuck''

976
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:51,334
''Oh my God!
The things that happen to me''

977
01:30:52,542 --> 01:30:55,875
''The heart's a magnet,
it gets stuck''

978
01:30:59,875 --> 01:31:03,000
''Every lover is bowled over
by my charms''

979
01:31:03,417 --> 01:31:06,833
''Goodness! What an offense
youthfulness is''

980
01:31:06,834 --> 01:31:09,959
''How it torments me
all day and night...''

981
01:31:10,375 --> 01:31:13,458
''the heart's a magnet,
it gets stuck''

982
01:31:17,083 --> 01:31:23,292
''Oh my God!
The things that happen to me''

983
01:31:24,625 --> 01:31:27,792
''The heart's a magnet,
it gets stuck''

984
01:31:37,166 --> 01:31:39,958
You...?
Where's Rangila?

985
01:31:39,959 --> 01:31:42,833
Rangila struck a deal and left

986
01:31:42,834 --> 01:31:46,290
''He has even collected
100,000 as per my promise''

987
01:31:46,291 --> 01:31:50,166
''And here's your 100,000.
- What's this for?''

988
01:31:50,834 --> 01:31:55,291
''Consider it to be your reward.
- A reward? Of 100,000 ?''

989
01:31:56,875 --> 01:32:01,834
''People blow up millions for passion.
This is just 100,000''

990
01:32:03,041 --> 01:32:06,208
What do you mean?
- Just that you are tender

991
01:32:06,917 --> 01:32:10,124
And I’m told you are also a virgin

992
01:32:10,125 --> 01:32:15,083
''Which is why Rangila asked for
100,000 for a single night with you''

993
01:32:16,583 --> 01:32:17,583
What...?

994
01:32:19,834 --> 01:32:23,416
You talk of spending a night with
a girl your daughter's age?

995
01:32:23,417 --> 01:32:27,125
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
- Don't talk of shame and modesty...

996
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:33,125
to hide in a cloak of silly pretenses.
l know prostitutes like you very well

997
01:32:33,458 --> 01:32:36,957
l am not a prostitute!

998
01:32:36,958 --> 01:32:41,874
Although circumstances have
brought me to the brothel...

999
01:32:41,875 --> 01:32:46,332
l don't sell my body!
Do you understand?

1000
01:32:46,333 --> 01:32:50,165
What are you doing...?
No!

1001
01:32:50,166 --> 01:32:51,834
Let me go!

1002
01:32:55,875 --> 01:33:01,124
Leave me alone!

1003
01:33:01,125 --> 01:33:02,083
Help!

1004
01:33:15,958 --> 01:33:18,040
What is the matter?

1005
01:33:18,041 --> 01:33:20,374
Fallen woman!

1006
01:33:20,375 --> 01:33:23,291
it isn't dancing-bells you tied at
your feet for the sake of money

1007
01:33:23,292 --> 01:33:26,833
You've tightened the noose
around my neck!

1008
01:33:26,834 --> 01:33:30,124
You have spat at my love!

1009
01:33:30,125 --> 01:33:34,082
''I’m trying to pull you out of
this filth, and you...?''

1010
01:33:34,083 --> 01:33:38,207
you're getting deeper into it?

1011
01:33:38,208 --> 01:33:40,624
Looks like you're taking
to the colours here

1012
01:33:40,625 --> 01:33:45,125
''Enough! That's enough, Rakesh!
Not another word from you!''

1013
01:33:45,875 --> 01:33:49,375
You could hear the chiming of the
dancing-bells at her feet

1014
01:33:50,834 --> 01:33:54,083
But you couldn't hear her
shrieks of agony. Look!

1015
01:33:57,958 --> 01:34:01,375
She had gone out to lighten the
burden of money you're carrying

1016
01:34:01,875 --> 01:34:04,874
''Through dancing, that is.
Wonderful, isn't it?''

1017
01:34:04,875 --> 01:34:09,292
''She came back wounded, but she returned
with her chastity and her honour intact''

1018
01:34:09,958 --> 01:34:13,083
Who's all that for? Only you!
You get that?

1019
01:34:13,958 --> 01:34:18,375
You make 300 rupees! Tie the dancing
bells to your feet and dance...

1020
01:34:18,875 --> 01:34:22,874
''all your life, you still won't be
able to make so much of money!''

1021
01:34:22,875 --> 01:34:25,541
Do you understand?

1022
01:34:25,542 --> 01:34:28,584
What could you have done even
if she had slept with him?

1023
01:34:28,958 --> 01:34:32,417
You wouldn't have known it
all your life! You...

1024
01:34:32,916 --> 01:34:38,708
''He comes to beat her up,
the rotten sonofa...''

1025
01:34:40,375 --> 01:34:45,291
What else can a helpless
and defenseless man do?

1026
01:34:45,292 --> 01:34:49,417
He can't have his way.
So he raises his hand on the weak

1027
01:34:50,542 --> 01:34:56,500
''Rakesh, l wasn't as hurt and offended
that day when l was orphaned...''

1028
01:34:56,916 --> 01:35:02,915
when my step-father sold
in this marketplace...

1029
01:35:02,916 --> 01:35:05,958
as l have been pained today
by your behaviour!

1030
01:35:06,542 --> 01:35:10,791
''Muskaan, please! Forgive me.
Forgive me, please... please!''

1031
01:35:28,916 --> 01:35:31,915
Sorry for disturbing you.
But may l sit here?

1032
01:35:31,916 --> 01:35:33,167
Sit down

1033
01:35:33,916 --> 01:35:38,874
''l can't sit here, unless
your wife asks me to''

1034
01:35:38,875 --> 01:35:43,207
Please be seated

1035
01:35:43,208 --> 01:35:47,167
''Believe me, Manav-saheb.
I’m proud of your courage''

1036
01:35:49,167 --> 01:35:53,624
All the best on your marriage.
- Thank you

1037
01:35:53,625 --> 01:35:56,291
But there's something
l can't figure out

1038
01:35:56,292 --> 01:36:00,082
Your pen has always written against
the nature of womenfolk...

1039
01:36:00,083 --> 01:36:03,250
and you start walking their path...

1040
01:36:04,916 --> 01:36:07,874
how did this sudden change
come about?

1041
01:36:07,875 --> 01:36:12,957
it’s only after meeting Pooja
that l realized how l wrong l was

1042
01:36:12,958 --> 01:36:16,541
l was caught in a vortex
of questions...

1043
01:36:16,542 --> 01:36:19,915
and Pooja's answers rescued me
from it

1044
01:36:19,916 --> 01:36:23,542
l realized after meeting Pooja that
a woman's life is full of tests

1045
01:36:24,833 --> 01:36:29,207
''The path they tread is so full of thorns,
they can't take anymore wounds''

1046
01:36:29,208 --> 01:36:33,207
I’m proud that Pooja is my wife.
- Wonderful!

1047
01:36:33,208 --> 01:36:37,583
''But people are eagerly awaiting
your next novel ''Bazaar''

1048
01:36:37,584 --> 01:36:40,957
So tell me when this wait will end

1049
01:36:40,958 --> 01:36:43,416
Never.
- What do you mean?

1050
01:36:43,417 --> 01:36:45,291
Maybe this novel will
never be completed

1051
01:36:45,292 --> 01:36:46,375
But why?

1052
01:36:47,916 --> 01:36:51,082
''l don't have an answer
to this ''why'' either''

1053
01:36:51,083 --> 01:36:56,333
''That's okay, but your readers are
going to be as hurt as l am''

1054
01:36:56,916 --> 01:36:59,915
it’s your decision

1055
01:36:59,916 --> 01:37:04,915
All l wanted to say is that
l want an interview with you

1056
01:37:04,916 --> 01:37:07,207
''I’m writing a special article
on ''Women's Day''

1057
01:37:07,208 --> 01:37:10,583
l need an interview with you for that.
Will you give me the time?

1058
01:37:10,584 --> 01:37:16,959
''Certainly. Give me a call tomorrow,
we'll decide when''

1059
01:37:22,875 --> 01:37:25,874
What you just said about the
novel never being completed...

1060
01:37:25,875 --> 01:37:28,166
is it true?
- Yes

1061
01:37:28,167 --> 01:37:31,250
''it is the novel that has
brought us together, Manav''

1062
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:34,541
''lf this novel remains unwritten,
it might...''

1063
01:37:34,542 --> 01:37:38,166
''Pooja, neither do l have
those views now...''

1064
01:37:38,167 --> 01:37:41,291
nor can my pen write as strongly
on the topic

1065
01:37:41,292 --> 01:37:45,250
The venom l had against women
has now vanished

1066
01:37:46,875 --> 01:37:50,000
l won't be able to write it anymore.
- Can l read the manuscripts?

1067
01:37:50,584 --> 01:37:51,542
Sure

1068
01:38:44,250 --> 01:38:47,459
I’ve read the manuscripts.
- So?

1069
01:38:49,375 --> 01:38:52,124
You must complete the novel

1070
01:38:52,125 --> 01:38:55,916
What was once poison
can also turn into an elixir

1071
01:38:55,917 --> 01:38:59,041
There are women who
talk against you today

1072
01:38:59,042 --> 01:39:02,624
This novel will make a place
for you in their hearts

1073
01:39:02,625 --> 01:39:06,166
Just as you have a place
in my heart

1074
01:39:06,167 --> 01:39:11,334
''Pooja, do you love me?
- More than my own life''

1075
01:39:14,833 --> 01:39:18,874
Can you ever be unfaithful to me?
- Never

1076
01:39:18,875 --> 01:39:21,208
But what has this question
to do with your novel?

1077
01:39:21,209 --> 01:39:24,916
I’ll explain

1078
01:39:24,917 --> 01:39:30,334
''l actually have two wives, Pooja.
One is you. The other is my pen''

1079
01:39:31,875 --> 01:39:35,874
And l can't be unfaithful
to either of you

1080
01:39:35,875 --> 01:39:39,833
There was a fire in my heart.
But that is no more

1081
01:39:43,125 --> 01:39:46,916
''l used to hate women and thus,
wrote against them''

1082
01:39:46,917 --> 01:39:51,209
But now l love women. And that
does not ignite a fire of hatred

1083
01:39:52,875 --> 01:39:55,291
''l can't write lies, Pooja''

1084
01:39:55,292 --> 01:39:59,417
''So l don't want you to bring up
this topic again, okay?''

1085
01:40:16,042 --> 01:40:19,832
He needs just a few words
to make me keep my mouth shut

1086
01:40:19,833 --> 01:40:24,625
But this novel ought
to be completed too

1087
01:40:29,833 --> 01:40:32,832
''is Mr. Manav there at home?
- No, he's not in''

1088
01:40:32,833 --> 01:40:34,916
Who's this?
- This is Rana here

1089
01:40:34,917 --> 01:40:36,916
Any message for him?

1090
01:40:36,917 --> 01:40:39,874
''No, never mind.
I’ll contact him again''

1091
01:40:39,875 --> 01:40:42,291
Mr. Rana...
- Yes?

1092
01:40:42,292 --> 01:40:46,041
l wish to meet you.
- Where?

1093
01:40:46,042 --> 01:40:50,333
At the coffee shop?

1094
01:40:50,334 --> 01:40:53,916
So what can l do for you?

1095
01:40:53,917 --> 01:40:57,249
l need some help from you.
- Help?

1096
01:40:57,250 --> 01:41:02,000
''Yes. l want you to help me in making
Manav complete his novel ''Bazaar''

1097
01:41:03,167 --> 01:41:06,874
''it’s like this, Pooja.
I’m not a writer, I’m a journalist''

1098
01:41:06,875 --> 01:41:10,792
Neither does my pen
have the spirit like Manav's...

1099
01:41:11,500 --> 01:41:15,458
nor his way of thinking.
- You don't have to write anything

1100
01:41:16,250 --> 01:41:18,166
They'll all be Manav's ideas

1101
01:41:18,167 --> 01:41:21,249
I’ll record this thoughts
and give them to you

1102
01:41:21,250 --> 01:41:25,292
You only have to put them on paper.
You can surely do that for me?

1103
01:41:28,042 --> 01:41:29,957
''Yes, l can''

1104
01:41:29,958 --> 01:41:33,209
But l have a condition. it’ll remain
a secret between you and me

1105
01:41:33,875 --> 01:41:37,125
''Manav mustn't get to know about it.
- No, he won't''

1106
01:41:41,833 --> 01:41:46,167
''Shabbo...?
She's become famous, eh?''

1107
01:41:47,583 --> 01:41:53,833
l keep getting complaints that you're
services aren't good enough nowadays

1108
01:41:54,500 --> 01:41:56,874
it’s terrible!

1109
01:41:56,875 --> 01:42:01,833
''Oh yes, everyone has problems.
But listen carefully to what l say''

1110
01:42:02,292 --> 01:42:05,458
''Never mix your family and
your business, okay?''

1111
01:42:05,875 --> 01:42:09,124
''All right, Anna.
I’ll keep that in mind''

1112
01:42:09,125 --> 01:42:14,375
Take care of the guys in there too.
Patil's sitting in your room

1113
01:42:14,833 --> 01:42:17,832
He's waiting for you!

1114
01:42:17,833 --> 01:42:20,249
''Go on, Shabbo. Please''

1115
01:42:20,250 --> 01:42:24,292
''isn’t he the same guy who bit Chandni,
and gave her a thrashing?''

1116
01:42:24,792 --> 01:42:27,624
And he even gave her cigarette burns.
- So...?

1117
01:42:27,625 --> 01:42:31,792
Anna! Look at her!
He did all that when he was drunk!

1118
01:42:33,500 --> 01:42:36,874
''Right now, he's not drunk.
So go on. Go''

1119
01:42:36,875 --> 01:42:39,208
''Anna, I’m going''

1120
01:42:39,209 --> 01:42:42,333
''But look, Rangila.
lf he bites me...''

1121
01:42:42,958 --> 01:42:49,583
I’ll slice off a part of your body
and turn you into an eunuch! You dig?

1122
01:42:52,250 --> 01:42:56,125
''Anna, I’ll send another girl
to Patil''

1123
01:42:56,958 --> 01:42:59,957
Where's Champakali...?

1124
01:42:59,958 --> 01:43:04,833
You have a tongue as sharp
as your looks

1125
01:43:06,541 --> 01:43:12,792
''What are you doing, Shabbo?
Your parents are here''

1126
01:43:17,458 --> 01:43:18,458
Hello

1127
01:43:20,917 --> 01:43:25,291
''For me, the doors of your house and
the way to the village are shut, right?''

1128
01:43:26,209 --> 01:43:32,458
But the way to this marketplace and me
will always be open to the two of you

1129
01:43:33,125 --> 01:43:35,083
Come with me. Come

1130
01:43:35,084 --> 01:43:38,916
''No, dear. How can we come in?''

1131
01:43:38,917 --> 01:43:43,291
Why? it’ll ruin your reputation?
Or are you going to be embarrassed?

1132
01:43:44,833 --> 01:43:48,415
You've been living off what l earned
here. You lost no respect then

1133
01:43:48,416 --> 01:43:53,916
And you lose respect to step
into the brothel today?

1134
01:43:53,917 --> 01:43:57,250
''Anyway, what brings you here?''

1135
01:43:57,875 --> 01:44:01,290
''My child, whatever happened at
the village wasn't nice''

1136
01:44:01,291 --> 01:44:04,582
The way your brother and l behaved
wasn't right

1137
01:44:04,583 --> 01:44:07,874
''That's okay, l don't hold
anything against you''

1138
01:44:07,875 --> 01:44:11,833
But you were not ignorant about
where the money was coming from

1139
01:44:13,917 --> 01:44:17,167
l was only keeping you and your
freeloading sons' kitchen going

1140
01:44:18,875 --> 01:44:22,792
They're freeloaders. So are their
wives and their children

1141
01:44:24,875 --> 01:44:27,249
''l was humiliated and
thrown out, Mother''

1142
01:44:27,250 --> 01:44:30,833
Publicly at that.
- He's ashamed of what he has done

1143
01:44:31,333 --> 01:44:34,833
Ashamed? They ought to
drown out of shame!

1144
01:44:35,167 --> 01:44:38,249
''Grown up men sit at home and sire
children, thriving on sin!''

1145
01:44:38,250 --> 01:44:41,875
Their sister sells herself in the
city to keep their families going

1146
01:44:43,625 --> 01:44:47,416
What could l do? One has to toe
the line of the villagers

1147
01:44:47,959 --> 01:44:51,500
it has to do with my respect.
But even if they said something...

1148
01:44:51,959 --> 01:44:54,541
what difference does it make
to our relationship?

1149
01:44:54,542 --> 01:44:57,916
You are my daughter.
We share blood relations

1150
01:44:57,917 --> 01:45:03,999
''And that is why you finished
the blood relations, father''

1151
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:07,792
''Say something, will you?
- What will l say? She knows...''

1152
01:45:08,583 --> 01:45:12,000
how helpless and vulnerable
women in the world are

1153
01:45:12,542 --> 01:45:15,916
Neither did my husband earn a living
nor my sons

1154
01:45:15,917 --> 01:45:19,999
l was destined to have all the
useless men in my life

1155
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:24,042
''But how will we run the family if
you don't send any money, my child?''

1156
01:45:24,667 --> 01:45:28,500
''At this age, I’ll have to become
a servant in people's homes''

1157
01:45:29,333 --> 01:45:32,583
''My child, my sons wouldn't mind
living off even that earning''

1158
01:45:34,959 --> 01:45:38,582
''No, mother. Don't cry''

1159
01:45:38,583 --> 01:45:42,624
This is the destiny women
were born with

1160
01:45:42,625 --> 01:45:46,124
She's compelled to sell herself

1161
01:45:46,125 --> 01:45:50,416
''As long as I’m alive, such
a situation will never arise''

1162
01:45:51,917 --> 01:45:54,207
l will sell whatever l can...

1163
01:45:54,208 --> 01:45:56,916
to feed all of you

1164
01:45:56,917 --> 01:46:00,000
''Yes, my child.
I’m your unfortunate mother''

1165
01:46:04,917 --> 01:46:07,874
I’ll never come to the village

1166
01:46:07,875 --> 01:46:11,415
But you'll keep
receiving the money

1167
01:46:11,416 --> 01:46:13,958
Go on now. Go

1168
01:46:13,959 --> 01:46:17,999
May Allah give you the
rest of my years

1169
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:22,416
''Why curse me, mother?
What will l do with life?''

1170
01:46:29,250 --> 01:46:35,834
Wow! What a father and what
vulture-like sons!

1171
01:46:36,875 --> 01:46:41,042
They sell a daughter's flesh and
buy themselves food with the money

1172
01:46:41,917 --> 01:46:45,541
lf every father and brother were
to become like you...

1173
01:46:45,542 --> 01:46:49,165
every house of a girl would
turn into a brothel

1174
01:46:49,166 --> 01:46:53,125
With sin being committed inside and
merriment taking place outside

1175
01:46:54,125 --> 01:46:58,833
What a shame!

1176
01:47:07,917 --> 01:47:13,834
''Secretly, l am recording my husband's
thoughts of the novel ''Bazaar''

1177
01:47:14,917 --> 01:47:18,207
''Even if what I’m doing is wrong,
I’ll touch his feet...''

1178
01:47:18,208 --> 01:47:22,333
''seek his blessings and forgiveness,
and continue recording for the novel''

1179
01:47:42,208 --> 01:47:46,582
Such a beautiful body
in that lovely sari

1180
01:47:46,583 --> 01:47:48,999
And what a killer smile

1181
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:54,874
My heart's going to be
shattered today

1182
01:47:54,875 --> 01:47:57,040
You appear to be in a very
romantic mood today

1183
01:47:57,041 --> 01:48:01,208
''With such a beautiful sight, even
a coconut tree could bear roses!''

1184
01:48:01,500 --> 01:48:05,375
How did a man who called women
opportunists and deceivers...

1185
01:48:05,834 --> 01:48:09,500
suddenly change his views?
What do you think about women now?

1186
01:48:14,959 --> 01:48:18,916
A woman's life is like
that of a rose

1187
01:48:18,917 --> 01:48:22,166
''Although the rose is the king of
flowers, it lives among thorns''

1188
01:48:24,041 --> 01:48:29,500
That's how women are too

1189
01:48:29,917 --> 01:48:32,833
People only look at their faces

1190
01:48:32,834 --> 01:48:36,375
They don't see the thorns their
families have laid at their feet

1191
01:48:39,083 --> 01:48:43,875
''Without women, society would be like
a body without a soul''

1192
01:49:50,875 --> 01:49:54,417
What's up? You appear very lost
nowadays. What's on your mind?

1193
01:49:55,333 --> 01:49:58,375
What else? I’m busy doing up
your little world

1194
01:49:58,875 --> 01:50:00,957
What do you mean?
- l mean...

1195
01:50:00,958 --> 01:50:05,208
I’m doing up the house. I’ve got
to go shopping for that

1196
01:50:05,834 --> 01:50:08,249
Didn't you ask me to turn
the house into a heaven?

1197
01:50:08,250 --> 01:50:12,833
Can't you see a change
in the house?

1198
01:50:12,834 --> 01:50:15,541
l don't know.
- How will you notice it?

1199
01:50:15,542 --> 01:50:17,833
You just don't have the time!

1200
01:50:17,834 --> 01:50:23,541
''Anyway, could you drop me at the
market? l got to do some shopping''

1201
01:50:23,542 --> 01:50:26,792
Get on my back.
- Not your back! Your car

1202
01:50:27,125 --> 01:50:32,583
''Okay, let's go in the car''

1203
01:51:56,875 --> 01:52:01,499
When did you return?
- What difference does that make?

1204
01:52:01,500 --> 01:52:03,583
One only needs to realize

1205
01:52:03,584 --> 01:52:05,416
it makes no difference
when a man returns

1206
01:52:05,417 --> 01:52:07,166
Meaning?
- Never mind all that

1207
01:52:07,167 --> 01:52:09,249
Where are you coming from
at this hour of the night?

1208
01:52:09,250 --> 01:52:14,124
l got delayed while shopping.
- Shopping?

1209
01:52:14,125 --> 01:52:18,083
You aren't carrying a single bag.
- Where did l do any shopping?

1210
01:52:18,833 --> 01:52:21,374
l met a friend and
went over to her place

1211
01:52:21,375 --> 01:52:24,790
What is your friend's name?
- You don't know her

1212
01:52:24,791 --> 01:52:28,082
But she knows you.
She's a huge fan of yours

1213
01:52:28,083 --> 01:52:34,291
Never mind all this. Take a wash.
I’ll lay the table

1214
01:52:37,292 --> 01:52:39,666
You shouldn't have called now.
Manav's at home

1215
01:52:39,667 --> 01:52:43,333
l called to give you the good news
that the sucker has taken the bait

1216
01:52:45,208 --> 01:52:48,124
He has gone crazy like me.
- Really?

1217
01:52:48,125 --> 01:52:51,417
''We'll show such a blast to Manav,
he'll remember it all his life''

1218
01:52:52,041 --> 01:52:57,625
We'll talk about it when
we meet tomorrow. Bye

1219
01:53:08,833 --> 01:53:14,250
''Manav, are you okay?''

1220
01:53:15,167 --> 01:53:17,874
You've wrecked the Taj Mahal?
What have you done?

1221
01:53:17,875 --> 01:53:20,832
''Yes, I’ve wrecked it!
it was a fake!''

1222
01:53:20,833 --> 01:53:24,957
What's come over you?
- Come...

1223
01:53:24,958 --> 01:53:26,957
Where are you taking me?
- Come with me!

1224
01:53:26,958 --> 01:53:32,291
Let go of my hand!
- C'mon!

1225
01:53:38,833 --> 01:53:43,542
Get out. Step out!

1226
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:49,291
Why have you brought me here?

1227
01:53:51,625 --> 01:53:54,999
isn’t this the place
l took you away from?

1228
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:58,041
l washed away your stains
and slurs!

1229
01:53:58,042 --> 01:54:01,249
l took you as my wife
and kept you at home!

1230
01:54:01,250 --> 01:54:04,833
l gave you respect in a society
which hated you!

1231
01:54:06,083 --> 01:54:08,957
l loved you more than my life!

1232
01:54:08,958 --> 01:54:14,834
And what did you give me?
Betrayal?

1233
01:54:15,125 --> 01:54:19,125
You have proved that a woman can give
only betrayal and deceit!

1234
01:54:19,500 --> 01:54:23,167
''Especially a woman like you, who can
become a lover to many men...''

1235
01:54:23,500 --> 01:54:27,583
but can never be the wife
of a single man!

1236
01:54:27,584 --> 01:54:30,333
That is why l have
brought you back!

1237
01:54:30,334 --> 01:54:33,833
Sit in this filthy brothel and
play with all the men you want to!

1238
01:54:34,125 --> 01:54:36,082
But l...
- Don't use tears...

1239
01:54:36,083 --> 01:54:40,957
to shield the shameless things
you have done!

1240
01:54:40,958 --> 01:54:44,166
l have seen everything for myself!

1241
01:54:44,167 --> 01:54:48,374
l don't want you to even
utter my name in the future

1242
01:54:48,375 --> 01:54:54,249
Forget about coming back
into my life!

1243
01:54:54,250 --> 01:54:56,915
''Manav, don't leave me
and go away''

1244
01:54:56,916 --> 01:55:02,042
Don't leave me!

1245
01:55:18,042 --> 01:55:22,875
What happened? You gave her away in
marriage. You called her your daughter

1246
01:55:23,917 --> 01:55:27,291
But she has come back.
Fakira...

1247
01:55:27,292 --> 01:55:31,875
it's easy to call these whores
your daughters

1248
01:55:32,917 --> 01:55:35,957
But they can't ever become
someone's wives

1249
01:55:35,958 --> 01:55:41,833
These whores leave these brothels
only in biers. Not palanquins

1250
01:55:42,875 --> 01:55:46,042
''By mistake,
she had left in a palanquin''

1251
01:55:47,875 --> 01:55:52,249
And that palanquin has had
a burial today

1252
01:55:52,250 --> 01:55:58,750
Won't you play the trumpet
to celebrate the burial?

1253
01:56:00,917 --> 01:56:04,292
Know what? Take off that garb
of decency...

1254
01:56:04,917 --> 01:56:08,124
apply some lipstick and powder
and get back to business

1255
01:56:08,125 --> 01:56:11,166
''Anna, she'll never get back
into prostitution''

1256
01:56:11,167 --> 01:56:13,874
She has washed away the slur
of sin...

1257
01:56:13,875 --> 01:56:16,874
l will not let her be stained
in sin again

1258
01:56:16,875 --> 01:56:21,000
''Even if she wants to,
l... l will stop her''

1259
01:56:21,833 --> 01:56:25,500
What for? Are you her mother?
- l mean everything to her

1260
01:56:25,833 --> 01:56:29,500
''lf anyone points a finger at her,
I’ll cut the bloody finger!''

1261
01:56:31,875 --> 01:56:34,333
Men have always suspected women

1262
01:56:34,334 --> 01:56:37,665
''in every age, it's women who have
to undergo the test by fire''

1263
01:56:37,666 --> 01:56:41,209
But women have always proved
men to be wrong

1264
01:56:42,375 --> 01:56:45,291
''One day, very soon...''

1265
01:56:45,292 --> 01:56:49,083
Manav will rub his nose at her
feet and ask for forgiveness

1266
01:56:50,708 --> 01:56:54,125
''Anna, you mustn't do anything
till then. No wrong advise''

1267
01:56:54,917 --> 01:56:58,541
''Don't compel her to sin!
l beg you, Anna!''

1268
01:57:37,875 --> 01:57:41,334
The trials of love...

1269
01:57:41,875 --> 01:57:45,167
she could never undergo

1270
01:57:54,334 --> 01:57:56,582
O Unfaithful....

1271
01:57:56,583 --> 01:57:59,457
what is loyalty?

1272
01:57:59,458 --> 01:58:03,625
She could never understand

1273
01:58:04,209 --> 01:58:08,125
She has driven me crazy...

1274
01:58:08,833 --> 01:58:15,292
and torments me

1275
01:58:22,375 --> 01:58:25,792
The trials of love...

1276
01:58:26,625 --> 01:58:30,167
she could never undergo

1277
01:59:10,833 --> 01:59:14,792
''You were the one
my heart beat for...''

1278
01:59:15,209 --> 01:59:19,125
''you were the one
l was known for''

1279
01:59:20,042 --> 01:59:23,333
You were one with my soul...

1280
01:59:23,917 --> 01:59:28,125
you were my very life

1281
01:59:55,167 --> 01:59:57,374
O Unfaithful....

1282
01:59:57,375 --> 02:00:00,291
what is loyalty?

1283
02:00:00,292 --> 02:00:03,875
She could never understand

1284
02:00:05,084 --> 02:00:08,792
She has driven me crazy...

1285
02:00:09,250 --> 02:00:12,500
and torments me

1286
02:00:23,416 --> 02:00:26,500
The trials of love...

1287
02:00:27,291 --> 02:00:31,000
she could never undergo

1288
02:01:07,167 --> 02:01:10,792
What's modesty?
What's loyalty?

1289
02:01:11,250 --> 02:01:15,250
''She has forsaken
the Eden of Love''

1290
02:01:16,375 --> 02:01:20,125
The memorial of my love...

1291
02:01:20,500 --> 02:01:24,167
you have wrecked

1292
02:01:51,625 --> 02:01:53,582
O Unfaithful....

1293
02:01:53,583 --> 02:01:56,290
what is loyalty?

1294
02:01:56,291 --> 02:02:00,416
You could never understand

1295
02:02:01,250 --> 02:02:05,000
You have driven me crazy...

1296
02:02:05,500 --> 02:02:08,792
and torment me

1297
02:02:19,542 --> 02:02:22,750
The trials of love...

1298
02:02:23,792 --> 02:02:27,125
you could never undergo

1299
02:02:46,166 --> 02:02:49,874
''Have this, Fakira.
- No thank you''

1300
02:02:49,875 --> 02:02:53,541
''Eat it up, Fakira''

1301
02:02:53,542 --> 02:02:56,249
it’s ten days since
Pooja returned

1302
02:02:56,250 --> 02:02:59,124
And everyone laments the fact
that her family life has been ruined

1303
02:02:59,125 --> 02:03:03,084
But you won't eat or drink anything.
You won't go to sleep either

1304
02:03:04,250 --> 02:03:09,916
''At this rate,
you could fall sick''

1305
02:03:09,917 --> 02:03:13,165
When a daughter's life is ruined...

1306
02:03:13,166 --> 02:03:17,290
her father's life is ruined too

1307
02:03:17,291 --> 02:03:21,833
When Manav left Pooja here
it felt as if...

1308
02:03:21,834 --> 02:03:27,084
my Mumtaz's life was ruined.
- Mumtaz? Who's that?

1309
02:03:28,500 --> 02:03:31,999
''Speak up, Fakira''

1310
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:35,833
My daughter.
- Your daughter?

1311
02:03:35,834 --> 02:03:42,458
Yes. She fell for the love
of a deceitful man...

1312
02:03:44,834 --> 02:03:48,833
and got married to him

1313
02:03:48,834 --> 02:03:54,333
And that scoundrel sold her to a
brothel like this one and ran away

1314
02:03:57,875 --> 02:04:02,874
l looked in every brothel
of the city for my daughter

1315
02:04:02,875 --> 02:04:06,499
l went to every brothel

1316
02:04:06,500 --> 02:04:09,874
But there was no trace of her

1317
02:04:09,875 --> 02:04:13,332
Helpless and defeated...

1318
02:04:13,333 --> 02:04:17,958
l came to settle down
in this red-light district

1319
02:04:17,959 --> 02:04:21,375
l started looking for my Mumtaz
in every girl who passed by

1320
02:04:22,041 --> 02:04:25,958
But where would l find her?

1321
02:04:25,959 --> 02:04:31,000
''A father with a broken heart will
only see false dreams, won't he?''

1322
02:04:32,875 --> 02:04:37,458
When l gave Pooja away in marriage
and sent her off as a bride...

1323
02:04:37,959 --> 02:04:43,875
l felt as if l had sent my
daughter Mumtaz away as a bride

1324
02:04:46,667 --> 02:04:50,958
l thanked God a million times

1325
02:04:50,959 --> 02:04:57,333
''But when Manav humiliated her and
abandoned her here, l felt as if...''

1326
02:04:58,583 --> 02:05:01,917
my daughter Mumtaz was being thrust
into the fires of sin once again!

1327
02:05:06,125 --> 02:05:11,333
l have just one prayer to make to God.
Just one wish l have

1328
02:05:12,625 --> 02:05:15,916
''Lord Almighty, help Pooja
return to her family...''

1329
02:05:15,917 --> 02:05:19,874
and l will think both my daughters
are happily settled

1330
02:05:19,875 --> 02:05:24,834
That my daughters have found a
status of respect in society

1331
02:05:35,583 --> 02:05:38,874
''Bouquet for you, sir.
- Bouquet? Who sent it?''

1332
02:05:38,875 --> 02:05:44,334
''From this person, sir''

1333
02:05:51,333 --> 02:05:56,708
What's the bouquet for?

1334
02:06:00,292 --> 02:06:01,916
Manav...?
- Yes

1335
02:06:01,917 --> 02:06:04,457
Heartiest congratulations!
- What for?

1336
02:06:04,458 --> 02:06:09,958
''Parcel for you, sir.
- Please hold on''

1337
02:06:17,584 --> 02:06:22,917
''Could you keep it there, please?
- Sure''

1338
02:06:40,083 --> 02:06:42,249
''Heartiest congratulations, sir!''

1339
02:06:42,250 --> 02:06:45,875
l had no clue you would return with
such a bang to the literary world

1340
02:06:46,500 --> 02:06:49,915
This novel of yours is not just
the novel of the year...

1341
02:06:49,916 --> 02:06:51,957
it's the novel of the century!

1342
02:06:51,958 --> 02:06:54,915
''in just four hours,
we've sold 8000 copies''

1343
02:06:54,916 --> 02:06:58,250
''Your novel ''Bazaar'' has shaken up
the whole market!''

1344
02:07:17,375 --> 02:07:22,165
So you've opened the surprise gift?
- Why have you come here?

1345
02:07:22,166 --> 02:07:27,958
You are blindfolded by indecency.
I’ve come to take it off

1346
02:07:33,125 --> 02:07:37,207
No one can stop me today

1347
02:07:37,208 --> 02:07:41,833
''For this day, my lips were sealed
because of a promise l had made''

1348
02:07:43,417 --> 02:07:47,416
l was sworn to silence

1349
02:07:47,417 --> 02:07:51,874
But no one can stop me
from speaking up today

1350
02:07:51,875 --> 02:07:55,416
You had made your ideas and
thoughts public even earlier

1351
02:07:55,417 --> 02:08:02,208
But it was she who secretly recorded
your new ideas and thoughts...

1352
02:08:02,542 --> 02:08:06,375
and brought them to me.
That which l put on paper

1353
02:08:06,958 --> 02:08:10,333
To complete a novel you could
never have finished!

1354
02:08:11,916 --> 02:08:14,332
''in four days,
you've won fame...''

1355
02:08:14,333 --> 02:08:18,124
''you wouldn't have earned
even in 40 years, Mr. Manav!''

1356
02:08:18,125 --> 02:08:21,915
it’s your wife who truly
deserves credit for it

1357
02:08:21,916 --> 02:08:26,832
She's the one who took your novel
to such heights of fame

1358
02:08:26,833 --> 02:08:30,791
And you dumped her in the
marketplace of humiliation?

1359
02:08:31,500 --> 02:08:36,416
''You ought to be ashamed, Mr. Manav!
You ought to be ashamed!''

1360
02:08:36,417 --> 02:08:40,249
Till recently l thought she just
wasn't worthy of you

1361
02:08:40,250 --> 02:08:44,833
''But today, l can loudly say
that you're not worthy of her!''

1362
02:08:45,208 --> 02:08:48,332
Don't try to put up a defense

1363
02:08:48,333 --> 02:08:51,541
I’ve personally seen her going
into the hotel with you

1364
02:08:51,542 --> 02:08:54,875
And l know what a man and a woman
go to a hotel for

1365
02:08:55,500 --> 02:09:00,291
l was sure you'd pose
this dirty and indecent question

1366
02:09:00,292 --> 02:09:03,915
But l have an answer
to all your questions

1367
02:09:03,916 --> 02:09:05,041
One minute

1368
02:09:17,500 --> 02:09:21,624
This is my wife.
She's an invalid

1369
02:09:21,625 --> 02:09:29,584
l knew it's wrong for a woman to
go to a hotel with a lone man

1370
02:09:31,875 --> 02:09:36,499
So l wrote the novel
in her presence

1371
02:09:36,500 --> 02:09:39,915
''Ask her, if you can't believe me.
- Brother...''

1372
02:09:39,916 --> 02:09:43,791
every word of what he has said
is absolutely true

1373
02:09:45,958 --> 02:09:49,332
lf Pooja has stepped out
of the house...

1374
02:09:49,333 --> 02:09:55,750
it's only to take you
to your goal

1375
02:09:57,000 --> 02:10:01,417
May God take my son away
if I’m lying!

1376
02:10:01,916 --> 02:10:06,625
''No, sister!''

1377
02:10:06,833 --> 02:10:07,791
No!

1378
02:10:52,875 --> 02:10:54,915
''Don't lower your gaze, Pooja''

1379
02:10:54,916 --> 02:11:00,917
You've done something that has
made me proud in the world

1380
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:05,499
But I’ve fallen in my own esteem

1381
02:11:05,500 --> 02:11:12,125
''Yes, Pooja. You were a true wife
who went about her duties. And l...''

1382
02:11:14,167 --> 02:11:17,832
a victim of a perverted mind...

1383
02:11:17,833 --> 02:11:23,291
l forgot my duties
and thought you were a sinner

1384
02:11:23,292 --> 02:11:27,416
''I’m not worthy of
being forgiven, Pooja''

1385
02:11:27,417 --> 02:11:33,291
But every sinner is given
a chance to atone for his sins

1386
02:11:35,875 --> 02:11:36,791
Pooja...

1387
02:11:38,542 --> 02:11:43,208
please come back into my life.
I’m very lonely without you

1388
02:11:45,833 --> 02:11:48,832
''Forgive me, Pooja''

1389
02:11:48,833 --> 02:11:52,249
Don't embarrass me by
asking for forgiveness

1390
02:11:52,250 --> 02:11:56,167
How I’ve spent every moment
without you...

1391
02:11:56,500 --> 02:12:00,541
only l know.
However...

1392
02:12:00,542 --> 02:12:04,916
What Pooja? Do you have a condition?

1393
02:12:04,917 --> 02:12:10,292
I’m willing to meet every condition.
- No conditions. l have a request

1394
02:12:12,125 --> 02:12:16,917
By taking me home from this brothel
you gave me the sort of respect...

1395
02:12:18,542 --> 02:12:21,750
man can rarely ever give a woman

1396
02:12:24,583 --> 02:12:27,249
But the way you threw me
out of the house...

1397
02:12:27,250 --> 02:12:31,041
and dumped me in the brothel
all over again...

1398
02:12:31,042 --> 02:12:34,791
''wasn't right at all.
- You're right, Pooja''

1399
02:12:36,833 --> 02:12:41,665
There might never be something
as despicable as what I’ve done

1400
02:12:41,666 --> 02:12:46,000
All right. This is the market
l humiliated you and dumped you in

1401
02:12:47,292 --> 02:12:52,792
''in this place,
in everyone's presence...''

1402
02:13:00,167 --> 02:13:03,417
You Rakesh?
- Today's Muskaan's birthday

1403
02:13:05,209 --> 02:13:07,916
l want to spend
some time with her

1404
02:13:07,917 --> 02:13:11,082
Every moment of Muskaan's life
belongs to Anna

1405
02:13:11,083 --> 02:13:13,916
''She's in his captivity.
- lf you could help me, sis...''

1406
02:13:13,917 --> 02:13:17,417
Are you crazy? lf Anna gets
to know that I’m helping you...

1407
02:13:17,833 --> 02:13:19,416
he's not going to spare me

1408
02:13:19,417 --> 02:13:24,832
Won't a sister do this much
for her brother?

1409
02:13:24,833 --> 02:13:27,916
A sister can even lay down
her life for her brother

1410
02:13:27,917 --> 02:13:31,459
But what scares me is that my
brother might die with me

1411
02:13:32,083 --> 02:13:35,166
''No way, sister.
No one will get to know''

1412
02:13:35,167 --> 02:13:38,832
''This is a brother's promise.
- All right, come on''

1413
02:13:38,833 --> 02:13:42,208
''Only for two hours, okay?
Not a moment more''

1414
02:13:42,209 --> 02:13:45,916
''Else, your sister will walk
into the jaws of death''

1415
02:13:45,917 --> 02:13:49,208
Okay?
- Don't worry

1416
02:13:49,209 --> 02:13:54,625
Go on now.
I’ll do something about it

1417
02:13:55,875 --> 02:13:56,833
Anna...

1418
02:14:00,209 --> 02:14:01,458
Anna...

1419
02:14:03,500 --> 02:14:10,125
All hell has broken loose!
Muskaan has fled with her lover!

1420
02:14:10,875 --> 02:14:16,917
What rubbish are you talking?
- Check it out for yourself

1421
02:14:33,250 --> 02:14:34,209
Shabbo...

1422
02:14:37,334 --> 02:14:40,833
where is Muskaan...?
- l have no idea

1423
02:14:41,250 --> 02:14:42,500
No idea?

1424
02:14:44,917 --> 02:14:48,458
Where is Muskaan?
- I’ve helped her escape

1425
02:14:52,958 --> 02:14:56,541
Where is Muskaan?
- Muskaan was my responsibility Anna

1426
02:14:57,084 --> 02:15:01,749
Who're they to make her run away?
I’m the one who helped her escape

1427
02:15:01,750 --> 02:15:02,875
You...?

1428
02:15:05,334 --> 02:15:08,500
Where is Muskaan?
- I’ve helped her escape

1429
02:15:08,917 --> 02:15:13,041
You helped her escape?
Where's Muskaan? Where?

1430
02:15:13,042 --> 02:15:16,833
So you helped her escape?
You helped Muskaan escape?

1431
02:15:19,292 --> 02:15:22,916
Lock them all up!

1432
02:15:22,917 --> 02:15:27,792
''Move it, fatso!''

1433
02:16:24,125 --> 02:16:27,500
Ever since you came
to my marketplace...

1434
02:16:28,333 --> 02:16:31,374
things have been souring for me

1435
02:16:31,375 --> 02:16:34,792
My business is ruined.
My market is screwed up!

1436
02:16:36,042 --> 02:16:38,083
Little girl...

1437
02:16:38,084 --> 02:16:42,500
''even if someone gives me 8 million
instead of 800,000 today...''

1438
02:16:43,541 --> 02:16:47,540
I’m not letting you go

1439
02:16:47,541 --> 02:16:53,167
''Before everyone in this market today,
l, Anna...''

1440
02:16:55,209 --> 02:17:00,667
will deflower you!

1441
02:17:10,250 --> 02:17:11,209
No...

1442
02:17:13,541 --> 02:17:19,333
Anna! Don't touch her!

1443
02:17:23,875 --> 02:17:28,833
Don't dare touch her!
l won't spare you!

1444
02:19:31,875 --> 02:19:37,708
Come on out!
Get out of this hell!

1445
02:20:03,583 --> 02:20:09,000
''Watch out, Rakesh!''

1446
02:20:28,625 --> 02:20:29,542
Allah!

1447
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:59,834
These whores leave the brothel only
in a bier. Not a palanquin

1448
02:21:13,458 --> 02:21:18,833
''You're here, Manav...?''

1449
02:21:22,166 --> 02:21:23,833
What happened?

1450
02:21:23,834 --> 02:21:27,624
Shabbo has left us

1451
02:21:27,625 --> 02:21:32,541
Shabbo....?
- Yes

1452
02:22:24,292 --> 02:22:25,750
Shabbo...

1453
02:22:27,834 --> 02:22:29,125
my sister

1454
02:22:31,834 --> 02:22:35,499
You punish a brother
so severely?

1455
02:22:35,500 --> 02:22:40,958
You don't even give me an
opportunity to apologize?

1456
02:22:41,500 --> 02:22:46,666
''Forgive me, sister''

1457
02:22:50,875 --> 02:22:54,333
When l moved the shroud and looked
at her face one last time...

1458
02:22:55,916 --> 02:23:00,125
it seemed as if she was
peacefully asleep

1459
02:23:02,584 --> 02:23:07,083
Her silence made her anguish clear.
This market has always stripped her

1460
02:23:08,834 --> 02:23:11,833
But death grants her
respect today

1461
02:23:11,834 --> 02:23:15,125
''She is clothed from head to toe,
in a shroud''

1462
02:23:18,292 --> 02:23:22,583
''Shabbo often used to say,
When l go away from this world...''

1463
02:23:22,584 --> 02:23:26,999
''l will surely complain to
the Almighty about one thing''

1464
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:31,207
Send everyone to the world
as humans...

1465
02:23:31,208 --> 02:23:33,833
but do not make women

1466
02:23:33,834 --> 02:23:37,958
''But even if You must make women,
don't make them poor and dependent''

1467
02:23:38,916 --> 02:23:42,792
''Even if they are poor,
grant them death. Not the brothels''

1468
02:23:49,125 --> 02:23:52,208
There are few girls as lucky
as Pooja and Muskaan...

1469
02:23:52,500 --> 02:23:56,292
who leave this place
in palanquins

1470
02:23:57,208 --> 02:24:00,915
''Else, most of them don't even
get a decent burial''

1471
02:24:00,916 --> 02:24:06,917
''Go ahead, son.
Let's carry her bier''

1472
02:24:08,875 --> 02:24:14,207
Allah is the only God.
There is no other God but Allah

1473
02:24:14,208 --> 02:24:16,541
This Eden shall always exist

1474
02:24:16,542 --> 02:24:21,833
Every being shall have
his say and fly away
