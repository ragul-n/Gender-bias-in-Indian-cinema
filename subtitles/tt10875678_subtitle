1
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,985
Hey, Nandu. You are standing
outside the hospital, and smoking?

2
00:00:13,075 --> 00:00:14,565
My wife is ill, she is inside.

3
00:00:14,655 --> 00:00:16,008
What's wrong with her?

4
00:00:16,408 --> 00:00:17,988
She has some gynaecological problem.

5
00:00:18,997 --> 00:00:20,177
Gynaecological problem?

6
00:00:20,393 --> 00:00:22,272
I'm spending so much...
- How much did the cigarette cost?

7
00:00:23,485 --> 00:00:25,283
Ten rupees.
- Ten rupees?

8
00:00:25,593 --> 00:00:27,550
And, how many do you have
in your pocket? - One more.

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,083
You have money to buy death,

10
00:00:29,173 --> 00:00:31,997
but you don't have any money
to save your wife from death?

11
00:00:32,455 --> 00:00:33,535
What do you mean?

12
00:00:34,992 --> 00:00:36,988
Look, what is written
on it. It says, 'death'.

13
00:00:37,603 --> 00:00:39,673
And, this sanitary pad, says 'life'.

14
00:00:40,837 --> 00:00:42,980
Don't laugh.
With the cost of two cigarettes,

15
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,727
you can save your wife
from an infection,

16
00:00:44,817 --> 00:00:45,737
that can occur during periods,

17
00:00:45,827 --> 00:00:48,860
due to using a cloth.
You can save her.

18
00:00:49,172 --> 00:00:50,435
And if you don't smoke,

19
00:00:50,525 --> 00:00:52,808
you can save yourself from cancer.

20
00:00:52,898 --> 00:00:54,332
That means you can buy two lives,

21
00:00:54,422 --> 00:00:55,910
with what you spend on buying,
'death...'

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,953
One, yours and the other,
your wife's.

23
00:00:58,043 --> 00:00:59,573
Think, and then laugh!

24
00:01:01,003 --> 00:01:03,990
There is nothing macho
about smoking cigarettes.

25
00:01:04,237 --> 00:01:05,573
But, it takes courage to buy these.

26
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,162
'They say it is impossible
to understand,'

27
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:07,240
'the ways of the heart.'

28
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,373
'I am your narrator, HR.'

29
00:03:09,463 --> 00:03:12,070
'Today, I'll tell you the story
of Happy, Hardy, and Heer.'

30
00:03:12,422 --> 00:03:14,313
'This love story will touch
a chord in your heart.'

31
00:03:14,503 --> 00:03:17,480
'But stories that touch the heart,
often breaks them too.'

32
00:03:34,313 --> 00:03:35,743
'The song of love...'

33
00:03:36,652 --> 00:03:38,073
'The frenzy of waves...'

34
00:03:39,092 --> 00:03:40,623
'A tale of lovers...'

35
00:03:41,782 --> 00:03:43,320
'A story of true love.'

36
00:03:44,135 --> 00:03:46,678
"Yours and mine..."

37
00:03:47,902 --> 00:03:50,210
"Yours and mine..."

38
00:03:51,793 --> 00:03:56,588
"Yours and mine..."

39
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:02,992
"Yours and mine..."

40
00:04:03,082 --> 00:04:05,605
"Our tale of love."

41
00:04:07,168 --> 00:04:10,670
"Yours and mine..."

42
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,045
"Our tale of love."

43
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:50,973
"At times in the fragrant wind,
at times amid humid clouds,"

44
00:04:51,063 --> 00:04:53,752
"And at times, it is a holy prayer."

45
00:04:54,815 --> 00:04:58,662
"At times like the harsh Sun,
and sometimes like a cool shade..."

46
00:04:58,752 --> 00:05:02,033
"And at times like a cold wind..."

47
00:05:02,823 --> 00:05:08,415
"Yours and mine..."

48
00:05:10,423 --> 00:05:14,958
"Yours and mine..."

49
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:21,717
"Yours and mine..."

50
00:05:21,807 --> 00:05:24,280
"Our tale of love."

51
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,150
"Yours and mine..."

52
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,318
"Our tale of love."

53
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,943
'Hadippa!'

54
00:06:02,622 --> 00:06:03,515
'Punjab...'

55
00:06:04,028 --> 00:06:07,508
'Where a smile erupts on the lips
and the heart dances with joy.'

56
00:06:09,105 --> 00:06:10,930
'Where the
lord showers his blessings...'

57
00:06:16,303 --> 00:06:21,983
"Great is the divine, that leads
from darkness to light."

58
00:06:22,073 --> 00:06:24,152
'There is no place
like Punjab anywhere in India.'

59
00:06:25,463 --> 00:06:27,230
'However, there is one other thing,'

60
00:06:27,552 --> 00:06:29,090
'that can only be
found only in Punjab.'

61
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:32,298
'And the name of that
blooming flower is Happy Singh.'

62
00:06:33,055 --> 00:06:34,683
"Hey, Happy Singh!"

63
00:06:36,023 --> 00:06:38,413
Buddy, if you have any problem,

64
00:06:39,005 --> 00:06:40,250
don't ever tell me,

65
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,760
because I am riddled
with my own problems.

66
00:06:42,172 --> 00:06:43,498
'This is Happy Singh.'

67
00:06:43,588 --> 00:06:46,590
'His greatest
achievement in life is,'

68
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,005
'failure!'

69
00:06:48,253 --> 00:06:50,298
Loser! Loser!

70
00:06:50,388 --> 00:06:53,325
Loser! Loser! Loser!

71
00:06:53,415 --> 00:06:56,477
Loser! Loser! Loser!

72
00:06:56,567 --> 00:06:57,613
Loser!

73
00:06:58,442 --> 00:07:01,753
'The problem would have arisen
if Happy had an issue with this.'

74
00:07:01,843 --> 00:07:04,023
'But Happy is happy to be a loser.'

75
00:07:04,838 --> 00:07:07,228
Happy fail! Happy fail!
- He has gone mad!

76
00:07:07,318 --> 00:07:09,698
Happy fail! Happy fail!

77
00:07:09,788 --> 00:07:12,143
Happy fail! Happy fail!

78
00:07:12,233 --> 00:07:14,402
Happy fail! Happy fail!

79
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,055
'Happy never takes
anything to heart.'

80
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,498
'But there is one girl,'

81
00:07:18,588 --> 00:07:20,865
'who matters to Happy.'

82
00:07:21,862 --> 00:07:25,628
'She is our over smart,
and crazy girl, Heer.'

83
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:27,613
Hey, I know what you are up to!

84
00:07:27,703 --> 00:07:29,483
Stop that monitor act!

85
00:07:29,573 --> 00:07:32,327
If you complain
about me to the teacher again,

86
00:07:32,417 --> 00:07:33,822
then I swear on 'Babaji,'

87
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,772
I'll give you two tight slaps!

88
00:07:35,862 --> 00:07:37,040
Your skull will turn around.

89
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:38,753
You won't know
if you are coming or walking back!

90
00:07:38,843 --> 00:07:40,183
'Over smart!'
- Move aside!

91
00:07:40,447 --> 00:07:46,192
"When I set eyes on you,"

92
00:07:47,357 --> 00:07:53,233
"for the first time..."

93
00:07:54,545 --> 00:08:00,225
"I swear on you, I,"

94
00:08:01,588 --> 00:08:06,100
"lost my heart to you."

95
00:08:08,483 --> 00:08:13,100
"God has created me,"

96
00:08:13,877 --> 00:08:17,740
"only for you, my love."

97
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:23,655
"Beloved, for your sake, I can,"

98
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:29,383
"abandon the whole world."

99
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,062
'It is difficult
to explain the connection between,'

100
00:09:07,263 --> 00:09:09,148
'Happy and Heer in mere words.'

101
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:27,973
"Your smile has stolen my heart."

102
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,713
"You have given
a new life to my heart."

103
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:33,570
"My heart is full of desire..."

104
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,297
"I am crazy
about everything you do."

105
00:09:36,387 --> 00:09:39,235
"Your smile has stolen my heart."

106
00:09:39,325 --> 00:09:41,990
"You have given
a new life to my heart."

107
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,822
"My heart is full of desire..."

108
00:09:44,912 --> 00:09:47,783
"I am crazy
about everything you do."

109
00:10:04,553 --> 00:10:06,480
'Though both of them grew up
with time,"

110
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,382
'but both of them
were still children at heart.'

111
00:10:10,215 --> 00:10:12,627
'Their life is still full of fun,
frolic, and enjoyment.'

112
00:10:21,735 --> 00:10:27,343
"You toy with my heart..."

113
00:10:27,433 --> 00:10:32,855
"But you don't say a word
about how you feel."

114
00:10:32,945 --> 00:10:38,523
"You toy with my heart..."

115
00:10:38,613 --> 00:10:46,823
"But you don't say a word
about how you feel."

116
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:51,220
"The eyes speak of love..."

117
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:57,055
"Your eyes speak of love..."

118
00:10:57,807 --> 00:11:00,573
"Your smile has stolen my heart."

119
00:11:00,663 --> 00:11:03,000
'Happy's story
is the same centuries-old tale...'

120
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,467
'He knows how to love,'

121
00:11:04,557 --> 00:11:06,427
'but doesn't know, how
to express his feelings.'

122
00:11:06,897 --> 00:11:09,542
'To top it all, Heer is like
an old antique radio,'

123
00:11:09,632 --> 00:11:11,777
'that somehow doesn't catch
the signal of Happy's love.'

124
00:11:12,312 --> 00:11:14,898
'Like an old vehicle without
a silencer at a traffic signal,'

125
00:11:14,988 --> 00:11:17,083
'all she can do is make noise!'

126
00:11:17,173 --> 00:11:18,923
'She keeps eating everyone's head.'

127
00:11:19,493 --> 00:11:20,380
'Anyway, as of now,'

128
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,593
'Heer is working as an assistant
to a wedding planner.'

129
00:11:23,087 --> 00:11:25,020
'Though Heer
is not fluent in English,'

130
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,742
'but the fate lines on her palm,'

131
00:11:26,832 --> 00:11:28,335
'indicate she is going to U.K.'

132
00:11:28,425 --> 00:11:31,368
"Hey, over smart girl!"

133
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,685
I swear on Babaji.
Wow! I am so happy!

134
00:11:33,775 --> 00:11:36,112
We are going to the U.K., right?
What if the trip is cancelled?

135
00:11:36,433 --> 00:11:37,953
Yes, yes, we are going.

136
00:11:38,043 --> 00:11:39,688
But you will have
to check your habit of telling

137
00:11:39,778 --> 00:11:41,123
the truth to someone's face.

138
00:11:41,213 --> 00:11:42,350
Otherwise,
you will get into trouble one day.

139
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,828
Miss Amrita, you know,

140
00:11:43,918 --> 00:11:45,795
whether it is business
or my personal life, I can't lie.

141
00:11:45,885 --> 00:11:47,735
Yes. And that is your problem.

142
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,348
I am going to Gurvinder's site,

143
00:11:50,438 --> 00:11:51,735
you pick up the bangles
and come there.

144
00:11:51,825 --> 00:11:52,720
Okay, I will come.

145
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:54,313
Okay, see you.

146
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,683
Wrap these.
- Hey, you buy something else.

147
00:11:58,773 --> 00:11:59,965
You buy something else.

148
00:12:00,055 --> 00:12:01,680
Hey, give it to me...
- You bl**dy!

149
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:04,023
Heer!

150
00:12:04,113 --> 00:12:05,870
'Hey, Happy Singh!'

151
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,455
Heer!

152
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,402
Why are you engaging
with these animals?

153
00:12:18,827 --> 00:12:19,845
You head home,

154
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:21,900
I will deal with these rats.

155
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,425
Are you sure I should leave?

156
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,273
Go home.

157
00:12:28,802 --> 00:12:30,077
So, will you fight us?

158
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,223
Yeah, I will fight.

159
00:12:37,313 --> 00:12:40,088
It is better to go and harvest
paddy rather than beating him.

160
00:12:40,178 --> 00:12:41,875
At least, we will get some rice.

161
00:12:42,198 --> 00:12:44,645
Hey, fight me. I'll crush you!

162
00:12:46,953 --> 00:12:48,768
They are afraid
of me and my personality!

163
00:12:48,858 --> 00:12:50,093
"Hey, Happy Singh!"

164
00:12:52,303 --> 00:12:54,245
'Though Happy was born in U.K.'

165
00:12:54,335 --> 00:12:55,558
'but at the age of three,'

166
00:12:55,648 --> 00:12:58,020
'because his parents died
in an accident,'

167
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,255
'Happy came to stay with his uncle
and aunt in India.'

168
00:13:00,345 --> 00:13:02,740
'Today, uncle and aunt have
only two topics of discussion...'

169
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:04,177
'When will Happy marry Heer?'

170
00:13:04,267 --> 00:13:05,525
'And what will they
cook for dinner?'

171
00:13:05,792 --> 00:13:07,510
Yeah, auntie!

172
00:13:07,877 --> 00:13:10,288
Everyone is afraid
of my personality!

173
00:13:10,727 --> 00:13:11,935
Hey, son!

174
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:14,823
For how long will you keep scaring
boys for Heer's sake?

175
00:13:14,913 --> 00:13:18,223
You love her so much,
doesn't Heer realise that?

176
00:13:18,487 --> 00:13:19,608
Auntie?
- Hmm?

177
00:13:19,975 --> 00:13:21,580
Heer doesn't treat me that way.

178
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,507
She has fixed me in the friend zone.

179
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:26,643
In fact, I don't get
the love vibe from Heer.

180
00:13:26,733 --> 00:13:29,450
Hey, son! Forget about
the vibe and all that.

181
00:13:29,618 --> 00:13:31,713
What don't you go and propose
to her in Punjabi?

182
00:13:32,248 --> 00:13:33,310
Uncle,

183
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,472
the day I feel,
it is the right time,

184
00:13:35,808 --> 00:13:37,210
I will propose to Heer.

185
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,277
But till then, don't give me a dose
of your lecture.

186
00:13:39,367 --> 00:13:41,307
Oh, yeah! Dose reminds me...

187
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:42,763
Why don't you cook 'dosa' today?

188
00:13:42,853 --> 00:13:44,528
Yeah, with a new combination,
'sarsoon ka saag.'

189
00:13:44,618 --> 00:13:46,185
With a liberal portion of butter.
- Superb.

190
00:13:48,253 --> 00:13:49,537
Happy.
- Yeah?

191
00:13:49,627 --> 00:13:52,518
I am going to London with papa
in the next fifteen days.

192
00:13:55,025 --> 00:13:57,448
We are leaving this country.

193
00:13:57,765 --> 00:13:59,635
Just a few nights
are left for us in India...

194
00:13:59,725 --> 00:14:01,905
Soon we will see the dawn in London.

195
00:14:01,995 --> 00:14:03,973
Papa, this was a bad one. Huh!

196
00:14:04,063 --> 00:14:05,085
Oh! Let go!

197
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,287
Actually, Heer...

198
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,783
That Latika...

199
00:14:12,723 --> 00:14:14,123
She is also, in London, right?

200
00:14:14,518 --> 00:14:16,213
Hey, buddy!
She is no longer Latika.

201
00:14:16,303 --> 00:14:17,340
She is Lats now.

202
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:19,478
And now, she doesn't stay in London,
but stays in Manchester.

203
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:21,258
Yeah, yeah.
What difference does it make?

204
00:14:22,007 --> 00:14:24,033
London or Manchester,
they are all close.

205
00:14:24,373 --> 00:14:25,868
I was thinking, Heer...

206
00:14:26,095 --> 00:14:27,950
We will have the time of our life.

207
00:14:28,215 --> 00:14:29,927
When everyone is together in London.

208
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,958
Why will you have
the time of your life?

209
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:33,900
That is what I had come here
to tell you.

210
00:14:34,135 --> 00:14:36,455
That I am also, coming
to London... With you all.

211
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,458
You are also, going to London?
- Why? Can I not go to London?

212
00:14:40,548 --> 00:14:41,888
I am already a citizen of U.K.

213
00:14:41,978 --> 00:14:44,172
Oh! I meant to say is...
- What do you mean?

214
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,963
Actually, I have got a job there.

215
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:49,263
At the
Agricultural Research Centre there.

216
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:51,045
I don't believe you, useless fellow!

217
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:53,125
What difference
does it make whether you believe it?

218
00:14:53,405 --> 00:14:55,310
The truth will forever
remain the truth.

219
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,375
When you visit me at work
then see for yourself...

220
00:14:57,465 --> 00:14:58,848
Whether I have a job or not.

221
00:14:58,938 --> 00:14:59,815
I'll take your leave.

222
00:14:59,905 --> 00:15:01,400
I have to help uncle
and auntie to pack.

223
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:05,033
Papa.

224
00:15:05,262 --> 00:15:06,843
How come this Happy is going
to London all of a sudden?

225
00:15:06,933 --> 00:15:08,910
How can this be a coincidence?

226
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,518
When a baby is born,
the first thing he does is cry,

227
00:15:12,252 --> 00:15:14,068
some realise their dreams
and some lose,

228
00:15:14,428 --> 00:15:16,260
and this word coincidence, dear,

229
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,238
is made for such situations.

230
00:15:18,328 --> 00:15:19,755
'Hey! Happy Singh!'

231
00:15:21,213 --> 00:15:22,898
Hey! I lied to Heer...

232
00:15:23,537 --> 00:15:25,040
That I have got a job in London.

233
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,583
Hey, wow! Well done, son!

234
00:15:27,673 --> 00:15:29,855
People commit murders
for their love,

235
00:15:29,945 --> 00:15:32,180
and all you have done is speak
a small lie. Well done!

236
00:15:32,823 --> 00:15:34,848
So, should I go to London?
- Hey, shut up!

237
00:15:35,475 --> 00:15:37,768
I will not allow you to go to London
or anywhere else. Got it?

238
00:15:37,982 --> 00:15:39,168
Should I go to London, indeed!

239
00:15:39,798 --> 00:15:41,392
Preeto!
- Coming.

240
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:43,883
Yes, what is it?

241
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:46,298
Look,

242
00:15:47,002 --> 00:15:49,613
make a few pizza's
and burgers tonight.

243
00:15:50,315 --> 00:15:51,670
We have to practise...

244
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,415
Don't we all have to go to London
after twenty days?

245
00:15:53,805 --> 00:15:56,412
Ah!
- Hey, uncle! I love you!

246
00:15:56,502 --> 00:15:58,228
I love you! Ah!
- Yes!

247
00:15:58,318 --> 00:16:01,593
"We are like a flock of birds..."

248
00:16:01,683 --> 00:16:05,023
"We will fly away..."

249
00:16:05,113 --> 00:16:08,827
"We will fly away
to a far-off land..."

250
00:16:08,917 --> 00:16:11,083
"We will fly away..."

251
00:16:11,173 --> 00:16:13,407
London! We are coming!
- Yeah!

252
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,188
I love you, Heer! I love you!

253
00:16:23,175 --> 00:16:27,820
"We are like a flock of birds..."

254
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:31,543
"We will fly away..."

255
00:16:31,633 --> 00:16:36,255
"We are like a flock of birds..."

256
00:16:36,345 --> 00:16:39,963
"We will fly away..."

257
00:16:40,053 --> 00:16:44,580
"We will fly away
to a far-off land..."

258
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:48,370
"We will fly away..."

259
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:52,628
"We are like a flock of birds..."

260
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:03,663
"I have lost my heart to you,
my love,"

261
00:17:03,753 --> 00:17:09,065
"I have tossed and turned on
so many nights."

262
00:17:09,505 --> 00:17:14,880
"How do I tell you, sweetheart?"

263
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:20,213
"How deeply I am in love with you?"

264
00:17:20,577 --> 00:17:25,988
"You toy with my heart..."

265
00:17:26,323 --> 00:17:31,547
"But you don't say a word
about how you feel."

266
00:17:31,723 --> 00:17:34,432
"You don't say a word?"

267
00:17:34,522 --> 00:17:38,527
"The eyes speak of love..."

268
00:17:39,395 --> 00:17:44,320
"Your eyes speak of love..."

269
00:17:45,422 --> 00:17:48,283
"Your smile has stolen my heart."

270
00:17:48,373 --> 00:17:51,062
"You have given
a new life to my heart."

271
00:17:51,152 --> 00:17:53,870
"My heart is full of desire..."

272
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,568
"I am crazy about
everything you do."

273
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:59,528
"Your smile has stolen my heart."

274
00:17:59,618 --> 00:18:02,325
"You have given
a new life to my heart."

275
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:05,098
"My heart is full of desire..."

276
00:18:05,188 --> 00:18:07,837
"I am crazy about
everything you do."

277
00:18:07,927 --> 00:18:10,755
"Your smile has stolen my heart."

278
00:18:10,845 --> 00:18:13,540
"You have given
a new life to my heart."

279
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:16,338
"My heart is full of desire..."

280
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,322
"I am crazy about
everything you do."

281
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:22,657
Heer.

282
00:18:23,232 --> 00:18:24,825
I think, I should start painting.

283
00:18:26,087 --> 00:18:28,652
People seem to become famous
by painting eagles and crows?

284
00:18:29,265 --> 00:18:31,347
At least, I can paint
much better than this.

285
00:18:33,023 --> 00:18:33,897
Wait and watch...

286
00:18:34,788 --> 00:18:37,040
Such exhibitions
will display my paintings.

287
00:18:37,632 --> 00:18:38,803
Hey, buddy! Happy.

288
00:18:38,893 --> 00:18:40,515
If they display your painting here,

289
00:18:40,605 --> 00:18:42,115
then this place is done for.

290
00:18:42,853 --> 00:18:44,403
Hey, you never motivate me? Huh?

291
00:18:44,902 --> 00:18:46,473
Hey, buddy! Happy.

292
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,297
What I meant to say is,

293
00:18:48,387 --> 00:18:50,353
that your painting will be so good,

294
00:18:50,443 --> 00:18:52,768
that these people will not display
anything else, but your paintings.

295
00:18:57,508 --> 00:18:58,943
'Hey! happy Singh!'

296
00:18:59,325 --> 00:19:00,633
Okay, Happy.

297
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:02,088
You have been dodging
it for quite a while.

298
00:19:02,178 --> 00:19:04,303
Today, I have made up my mind
to see your office. Come on.

299
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,680
No! Actually...

300
00:19:06,698 --> 00:19:07,838
Actually, I lost my job.

301
00:19:08,193 --> 00:19:10,140
So, now what? What will you do?

302
00:19:11,123 --> 00:19:11,988
Now?

303
00:19:14,818 --> 00:19:16,160
Heer.
- Yeah?

304
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,303
Now, I will paint.

305
00:19:17,955 --> 00:19:18,788
You will paint indeed!

306
00:19:18,878 --> 00:19:20,218
Come, I will show you how to paint!
Come on.

307
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:26,535
"Whenever I utter your name,"

308
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:32,163
"my heart goes out of control,
and I forget the world."

309
00:19:32,253 --> 00:19:37,680
"Got knows when
will you break your silence?"

310
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:43,235
"For how long will I have to wait?"

311
00:19:43,325 --> 00:19:48,863
"You toy with my heart..."

312
00:19:48,953 --> 00:19:54,353
"But you don't say a word
about how you feel."

313
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:57,138
"You don't say a word?"

314
00:19:57,228 --> 00:20:01,270
"The eyes speak of love..."

315
00:20:02,128 --> 00:20:06,773
"Your eyes speak of love..."

316
00:20:08,092 --> 00:20:10,987
"Your smile has stolen my heart."

317
00:20:11,077 --> 00:20:13,785
"You have given
a new life to my heart."

318
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:16,593
"My heart is full of desire..."

319
00:20:16,683 --> 00:20:19,313
"I am crazy about
everything you do."

320
00:20:19,403 --> 00:20:22,235
"Your smile has stolen my heart."

321
00:20:22,325 --> 00:20:25,020
"You have given
a new life to my heart."

322
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:27,827
"My heart is full of desire..."

323
00:20:27,917 --> 00:20:30,633
"I am crazy about
everything you do."

324
00:20:31,852 --> 00:20:33,975
To all my patrons, connoisseurs
and my love...

325
00:20:34,065 --> 00:20:35,375
Hold on to your seats.

326
00:20:35,465 --> 00:20:38,093
I present to you
Happy Singh's remarkable painting.

327
00:20:40,343 --> 00:20:42,448
What are you trying
to prove with this painting, Happy?

328
00:20:42,893 --> 00:20:43,875
Feelings!

329
00:20:43,965 --> 00:20:46,000
Heer, I want to show
that there is a boy,

330
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:47,848
who is in love with a girl?

331
00:20:47,938 --> 00:20:49,812
But he is unable
to confess his love.

332
00:20:49,902 --> 00:20:52,860
The boy is very sad and
the girl refuses to understand...

333
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:55,088
That is why
this painting exudes pain, Heer.

334
00:20:55,178 --> 00:20:56,363
Try to understand. Pain!

335
00:20:56,453 --> 00:20:57,935
Heer look at the pain in it.

336
00:20:58,935 --> 00:21:00,723
I am also, feeling the pain.

337
00:21:00,813 --> 00:21:03,312
Really, Happy,
it is truly a painful painting!

338
00:21:04,695 --> 00:21:06,005
This is a farewell gift for Lats.

339
00:21:06,203 --> 00:21:07,123
This is modern art.

340
00:21:07,213 --> 00:21:08,858
You won't understand.
- Hey, guys!

341
00:21:09,338 --> 00:21:11,420
Call the devil and the devil
is here. - Hi.

342
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,350
Hi.

343
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,095
Hi, Chows!
- Hi, Happy.

344
00:21:14,185 --> 00:21:15,813
Are you done with your shopping?
- No, buddy.

345
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,495
This is just the beginning.
We have just started.

346
00:21:17,585 --> 00:21:18,513
Right, Charlie?
- She promised me.

347
00:21:18,603 --> 00:21:19,907
She will exhaust
all my credit cards.

348
00:21:19,997 --> 00:21:21,132
Yeah, I'll do that. Don't worry.

349
00:21:21,222 --> 00:21:22,200
Okay, an important thing...

350
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:23,483
I am here to tell you,

351
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,168
I am going to Manchester next week.

352
00:21:25,258 --> 00:21:27,015
So, this party that
you are planning,

353
00:21:27,105 --> 00:21:28,488
do it this Saturday,
I am cool with that.

354
00:21:29,008 --> 00:21:30,288
Yeah,
you are the only one who is cool,

355
00:21:30,378 --> 00:21:31,420
we are useless!

356
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,615
That you are.

357
00:21:32,908 --> 00:21:34,988
That person who can't do
just one thing in his life,

358
00:21:35,078 --> 00:21:36,337
which is so important,

359
00:21:36,427 --> 00:21:38,148
that person is useless.
What say, Charlie?

360
00:21:38,485 --> 00:21:40,603
You all really confuse me.
What are you guys talking about?

361
00:21:40,787 --> 00:21:43,587
Yeah, why are you both talking
in a code language?

362
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,733
Oh! Heer. She is taunting me,

363
00:21:46,188 --> 00:21:47,733
because I am not looking for a job.

364
00:21:47,823 --> 00:21:48,805
She is right.

365
00:21:48,895 --> 00:21:50,798
You were thrown out
of work within four months!

366
00:21:50,888 --> 00:21:52,293
You must have done something.

367
00:21:52,383 --> 00:21:54,550
Don't ever speak in my favour,
even by mistake!

368
00:21:55,003 --> 00:21:57,803
You think I am a loser
and you like achievers?

369
00:21:57,978 --> 00:21:59,590
Oh, no, Happy.

370
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,225
I like losers also.

371
00:22:01,315 --> 00:22:02,875
But achievers... I love them.

372
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:15,053
'Hardy aka Harshvardhan Bhatt.'

373
00:22:15,143 --> 00:22:17,720
'A musician at heart,
and a businessman.'

374
00:22:17,992 --> 00:22:19,010
'His father passed away when
he was a child,'

375
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,150
'but because of his sharp
Gujarati business sense,'

376
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,968
'he earned a lot of money
in the share market.'

377
00:22:23,058 --> 00:22:25,408
'And to indulge in his hobby,
he also runs a music company.'

378
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:27,585
'Hardy may have been born in U.K.'

379
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:30,010
'but he walks around
with India in his heart.'

380
00:22:30,495 --> 00:22:32,128
'This is Hardy's mother, Suhasini.'

381
00:22:32,422 --> 00:22:35,178
'Hardy's mother dreams
of his wedding, day and night.'

382
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,940
'But dreams are dreams,'

383
00:22:37,513 --> 00:22:38,830
'who knows
when they will come true?'

384
00:22:40,428 --> 00:22:42,375
"What is the secret of
this double role?"

385
00:22:42,465 --> 00:22:44,283
"What is the secret
of this double role?"

386
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:47,713
'Bobby, Hardy treats
her like a sister.'

387
00:22:49,057 --> 00:22:51,857
'Bobby's father, Mr Kapoor
is Hardy's business partner.'

388
00:22:51,947 --> 00:22:55,183
'Despite being an achiever
at the age of thirty-eight years,'

389
00:22:55,425 --> 00:22:57,265
'why isn't he married yet?'

390
00:22:57,475 --> 00:22:58,817
'Find out for yourself.'

391
00:23:05,735 --> 00:23:08,045
Hey, Hardy.
We were just talking about you.

392
00:23:08,135 --> 00:23:11,290
Tell us your story, buddy.
But you will have to sing.

393
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:25,697
"It took me four months to woo her."

394
00:23:25,787 --> 00:23:30,445
"It took another four months
to date her in winter."

395
00:23:30,535 --> 00:23:32,733
"Then I am not sure what happened?"

396
00:23:32,823 --> 00:23:35,202
"She suddenly left me..."

397
00:23:35,292 --> 00:23:39,775
"And I was left high and dry...
Waiting for her."

398
00:23:39,865 --> 00:23:42,297
"I did not know that,"

399
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:44,678
"she was just toying with my heart."

400
00:23:44,768 --> 00:23:49,800
"And she was just using me
to foot her bills."

401
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,915
"She was a thief..."

402
00:23:58,410 --> 00:23:59,458
"My, Ex..."

403
00:24:03,048 --> 00:24:04,272
"She was a thief..."

404
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:13,177
"I had bought her a gold earring,"

405
00:24:13,267 --> 00:24:17,955
"by using up
all my savings like a fool."

406
00:24:18,045 --> 00:24:22,573
"She said she would marry me,"

407
00:24:22,663 --> 00:24:27,460
"So, I would ignore
all her mistakes."

408
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:32,195
"But that she will turn out
to be a con,"

409
00:24:32,285 --> 00:24:37,275
"and her love was fake,
how could I have known?

410
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,345
"She was a thief..."

411
00:24:45,952 --> 00:24:47,080
"My, Ex..."

412
00:24:50,582 --> 00:24:51,680
"She was a thief..."

413
00:24:55,425 --> 00:24:56,350
"My, Ex..."

414
00:25:00,095 --> 00:25:01,237
"She was a thief..."

415
00:25:04,705 --> 00:25:06,258
In this game of truth and dare,

416
00:25:06,348 --> 00:25:08,530
now, it's my time.
And I will speak the truth.

417
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,105
Come on, ask me.
What is your question?

418
00:25:10,195 --> 00:25:12,193
One minute! One minute!
Let me think, first.

419
00:25:12,283 --> 00:25:13,982
I will ask him such
a tough question,

420
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:16,210
that will help us to defeat him
in this game. What say? - Correct.

421
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:19,390
Hey, uncle, you don't need a tough
question to defeat him.

422
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,043
If he runs a solo race,
he will still come second.

423
00:25:22,893 --> 00:25:26,058
She is talking too much.
- I will not come second!

424
00:25:27,122 --> 00:25:29,825
Then?
- I will come last! Last!

425
00:25:30,367 --> 00:25:32,248
Let's all raise a toast
to our loser friend,

426
00:25:32,338 --> 00:25:33,415
Harpreet Singh Lamba.

427
00:25:33,505 --> 00:25:36,750
Shut up!
- Harpreet Singh Lamba! Yeah!

428
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,465
Sit down!
- Oh, no worries.

429
00:25:38,555 --> 00:25:40,720
Happy, you really enjoy
being a loser?

430
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:41,667
Heer.

431
00:25:42,517 --> 00:25:44,385
Sometimes, it's okay to have fun
with friends and relatives.

432
00:25:44,745 --> 00:25:46,663
Anyway, does it matter
what you write on a blackboard

433
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:47,845
with black chalk.

434
00:25:50,723 --> 00:25:51,778
And tell me something.

435
00:25:52,327 --> 00:25:55,933
You also call me a loser
at least ten times in a day?

436
00:25:56,023 --> 00:25:58,233
Look, Happy, do not compare me
with the others.

437
00:25:58,323 --> 00:25:59,127
My case is different.

438
00:25:59,217 --> 00:26:01,392
Oh, yeah! You are different!

439
00:26:01,482 --> 00:26:03,275
But, tell me the truth, Heer...

440
00:26:04,413 --> 00:26:05,685
The world calls me a loser,

441
00:26:07,432 --> 00:26:08,590
you do feel embarrassed?

442
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,753
I feel embarrassed?

443
00:26:10,033 --> 00:26:12,693
No, I don't feel embarrassed,
I feel angry at you.

444
00:26:12,783 --> 00:26:15,677
I feel like slapping you
and breaking your jaws! Idiot!

445
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,457
One minute! One minute!
- Yeah.

446
00:26:17,547 --> 00:26:19,058
Yeah, I know what question
to ask. - Yes.

447
00:26:19,148 --> 00:26:20,223
Happy, imagine that,

448
00:26:20,603 --> 00:26:22,983
you are on an isolated island, okay?

449
00:26:23,073 --> 00:26:24,818
I mean, you have no contact
with anyone. - Yes.

450
00:26:25,082 --> 00:26:26,183
You are alone.

451
00:26:26,608 --> 00:26:28,203
Who will you take along with you?

452
00:26:28,293 --> 00:26:30,155
Yeah, now tell us. Come on tell us?
- Yeah.

453
00:26:32,177 --> 00:26:33,780
You have asked a good question...

454
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:36,060
Let's see what the answer will be.
- Wow!

455
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:40,723
And let's find out what
is our Happy's dream?

456
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:46,663
Wow! Auntie.
But, but, I have a question...

457
00:26:46,753 --> 00:26:49,013
If no one can come and go?

458
00:26:49,748 --> 00:26:50,818
Then who will I take along with me?

459
00:26:50,908 --> 00:26:52,078
Look, look... now don't act smart.
- Hey.

460
00:26:52,168 --> 00:26:54,300
Hey, Happy!
- Okay, okay, I'll answer.

461
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,578
Yeah, tell us, come on.

462
00:26:55,668 --> 00:26:57,542
She who is sitting next to me...

463
00:26:57,632 --> 00:26:59,380
Yeah?
- The one who is sulking...

464
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,222
I will take her along!

465
00:27:01,312 --> 00:27:02,570
Yeah.
- Heer! You lucky girl!

466
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,285
Now, start packing
for your trip to the island.

467
00:27:04,375 --> 00:27:06,712
No way! Not with him?
What will people say, Lats?

468
00:27:06,802 --> 00:27:07,788
Hey, buddy?

469
00:27:08,073 --> 00:27:10,395
There won't be anyone
there to say anything!

470
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:14,230
You! You turn
everything into a joke!

471
00:27:15,908 --> 00:27:16,838
Heer.

472
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,668
Why are you getting so angry?
- I am not angry.

473
00:27:20,443 --> 00:27:22,563
I feel bad for you.

474
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:25,720
You! You are not even a good loser!

475
00:27:26,622 --> 00:27:29,817
Losers are ones who try to do
something and fail.

476
00:27:30,653 --> 00:27:32,718
A person who has never
earned a dime in life,

477
00:27:32,808 --> 00:27:35,057
calling him a loser will only
amount to praise!

478
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,038
The truth is always bitter!

479
00:27:39,013 --> 00:27:44,818
"I swear on you,"

480
00:27:46,055 --> 00:27:50,625
"I have lost my heart to you."

481
00:27:52,943 --> 00:27:57,413
"God has created me,"

482
00:27:58,338 --> 00:28:02,057
"only for you, my love."

483
00:28:03,862 --> 00:28:08,230
"Beloved, for your sake, I can,"

484
00:28:08,928 --> 00:28:12,418
"abandon the whole world."

485
00:28:12,508 --> 00:28:13,928
'Heer.'

486
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,290
'Buddy, you gave me
a good scolding yesterday.'

487
00:28:17,803 --> 00:28:18,983
'You gave me good.'

488
00:28:22,308 --> 00:28:23,572
'But what you said was true,'

489
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:28,318
'even to achieve the title of a loser,
one has to try.'

490
00:28:30,745 --> 00:28:33,333
'And I am going to try.'
'Far away from you.'

491
00:28:34,438 --> 00:28:35,793
'To a place
where no one will call me a loser,'

492
00:28:35,883 --> 00:28:37,282
'without my making an effort.'

493
00:28:37,793 --> 00:28:41,075
'And I can't tell you
where I am going...'

494
00:28:41,993 --> 00:28:44,238
'I don't know when I'll be back?'

495
00:28:45,533 --> 00:28:50,670
"Yours and mine..."

496
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:52,973
"This tale of love..."
- 'But whenever I achieve something,'

497
00:28:54,363 --> 00:28:55,792
'I will definitely tell you.'

498
00:28:56,832 --> 00:28:58,260
'There is something
else, I wish to say,'

499
00:28:58,853 --> 00:29:00,752
'but as always, I will not be able
to say it now.'

500
00:29:01,783 --> 00:29:03,183
'Don't miss me too much.'

501
00:29:03,273 --> 00:29:08,680
"Yours and mine..."

502
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:12,067
"This tale of love..."

503
00:29:19,235 --> 00:29:20,620
'Three Months Later'

504
00:29:39,865 --> 00:29:41,682
Eat... Eat.
- Yeah, yeah, please eat.

505
00:29:42,848 --> 00:29:43,882
Sure.
- Uncle,

506
00:29:43,972 --> 00:29:46,525
I bet even her worst recipe
will be delicious.

507
00:29:46,958 --> 00:29:48,820
My auntie, is the world's best cook.

508
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:50,145
Hey, come on.

509
00:29:50,235 --> 00:29:52,265
Praise me a bit, also.

510
00:29:52,573 --> 00:29:54,353
Whatever
this world class cook prepares,

511
00:29:54,443 --> 00:29:56,340
who does she experiment on?

512
00:29:56,933 --> 00:29:58,032
On me, right?

513
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,842
What you eat,

514
00:30:00,443 --> 00:30:01,550
passes through me.

515
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,660
My uncle is also, the world's best.

516
00:30:04,225 --> 00:30:05,060
He is also, the best.

517
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:06,665
Apart from that girl here,

518
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:09,340
and of course, you guys... He misses
this food so much. - Yeah.

519
00:30:09,685 --> 00:30:11,905
And now, I can tell why.

520
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,440
Son.
- Yeah?

521
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:15,942
It's been three months since
you last spoke to Heer.

522
00:30:16,513 --> 00:30:18,998
You have changed
your phone number...

523
00:30:19,088 --> 00:30:21,578
Heer, keeps asking
us about you? - Yeah, buddy.

524
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:22,888
This is wrong.
- You?

525

For how long
will you stay away from Heer?

526
00:30:25,177 --> 00:30:27,940
As long as the emotions buried
in my heart, don't come out.

527
00:30:28,438 --> 00:30:29,500

529
00:30:32,623 --> 00:30:34,197
will bring out those
emotions very soon.

530
00:30:34,287 --> 00:30:35,502
Hey, son.

531
00:30:35,663 --> 00:30:37,173
Are you a man or a pawn
in a hide and seek game?

532
00:30:37,263 --> 00:30:38,668
Everyone is hidden within you?

533
00:30:38,758 --> 00:30:40,163
Is there nothing that
ever comes out? - Auntie!

534
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:42,478
Son, don't feel bad.

535
00:30:43,058 --> 00:30:44,110
But.
- Yeah?

The kind of paintings you make...

537
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,762
Oh, what?
- May God help,

538
00:30:48,852 --> 00:30:50,085
how do I explain this to you?

539
00:30:50,175 --> 00:30:52,963
In my opinion you should...
- Auntie.

540
00:30:53,675 --> 00:30:55,785
Do not form an opinion of me now.

541
00:30:55,875 --> 00:30:58,893
With time,
your opinion will, change.

542
00:31:00,123 --> 00:31:02,078
I will work hard. My time will come.

543

And, I will give you my first
earning very soon.

544
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:09,195
Till then
if Heer's father fixes her alliance,

545
00:31:09,285 --> 00:31:10,962
with someone else? What then?

546
00:31:11,335 --> 00:31:13,453
No, it's possible she may fall
for someone else?

547
00:31:13,543 --> 00:31:15,220
What if she starts
seeing someone else?

548
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:17,338
You will be left with nothing, son.

549
00:31:17,428 --> 00:31:18,503

did you start thinking?

Huh? Tell me!

568
00:32:11,217 --> 00:32:12,980
And what were you thinking?
You will change your dressing style,

569
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:14,870
and I won't be able
to recognise you?

570

- Listen, you are going too far!

Don't act smart with me.

this attitude for?

Hey, let him go. Huh?

575
00:32:24,877 --> 00:32:26,492
What is the matter, son?
What happened?

576
00:32:26,925 --> 00:32:29,953
Is he your son?
- Yeah, why?

577
00:32:31,073 --> 00:32:32,558
I am really sorry, huh.

578
00:32:33,177 --> 00:32:35,823
Sorry, auntie.
I swear on Babaji. He looks like,

my friend, Happy.

I am... I am really sorry.

581
00:32:39,657 --> 00:32:42,095
I thought...
- So, you decided to spoil my face?

582
00:32:42,785 --> 00:32:44,705
I am really sorry, huh.
I am really sorry, sir.

583
00:32:44,795 --> 00:32:46,537
I am really sorry.
- It's okay.

584
00:32:46,627 --> 00:32:48,442
Don't worry. Such things happen.

585
00:32:48,698 --> 00:32:51,817
They say there are seven people
with the same face in this world.

586
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:54,950
Does that mean you still have
to destroy six other faces?

587
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,928
No, no, only five.

588
00:32:57,105 --> 00:32:59,053
Because one of them
is my friend Happy.

589
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:01,282
The one whose face resembles yours.

590
00:33:01,372 --> 00:33:03,245
This is a misunderstanding auntie.

591
00:33:03,335 --> 00:33:05,113
Please, I am... I am really sorry.

592
00:33:05,203 --> 00:33:06,403
I... I am sorry.

593
00:33:06,493 --> 00:33:08,785
I am sorry. I'll take your leave.
- Okay.

00:33:09,035 --> 00:33:09,900
Bye.

595
00:33:12,948 --> 00:33:14,040
I am sorry.

596
00:33:14,465 --> 00:33:16,782
Crazy girl.
- She is crazy but...

597
00:33:19,118 --> 00:33:19,975
She is cute.

598
00:33:20,065 --> 00:33:22,613
Papa. That guy was looked
just like Happy.

A complete carbon copy.

600
00:33:24,623 --> 00:33:26,173

601
00:33:26,263 --> 00:33:27,677
His anger is like Happy's.

602
00:33:27,767 --> 00:33:30,147
And yeah, he was
overacting like Happy.

603
00:33:30,237 --> 00:33:31,890
Really. I swear on Babaji.

604
00:33:32,235 --> 00:33:34,207
I had heard that Happy's father,

605
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:36,265
was a very decent man.

606
00:33:36,662 --> 00:33:39,365
Did he have an affair in London?

607
00:33:39,667 --> 00:33:41,198
Are you done? Rubbish!

608
00:33:41,288 --> 00:33:43,315
Oh, don't get angry, dear.

609
00:33:43,405 --> 00:33:44,825
I was simply thinking,

610
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:47,603
is he Happy's twin brother
or something?

611
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:49,735
No, papa. His mother was saying,

612
00:33:49,825 --> 00:33:53,898
seven people in the world
are likely to have the same face.

613
00:33:54,803 --> 00:33:56,888
I hope his activities
are not like Happy's.

614
00:33:56,978 --> 00:34:00,053
No, no. He looked like
a successful businessman.

615
00:34:00,143 --> 00:34:01,443
Very dashing.

616
00:34:01,753 --> 00:34:05,235
You cannot stop singing his praises!

617
00:34:05,325 --> 00:34:07,515
I wonder what he thought of you?

618
00:34:08,028 --> 00:34:09,910
I hit him hard.

619
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,520
So, his reaction most likely will
be unfavourable.

700
00:38:39,638 --> 00:38:41,572
I have a very good option for that.

701
00:38:41,872 --> 00:38:43,037
Mr. Kapoor.

702
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,397
What do you mean?

703
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,575
Mom, I was seven years old
when papa left us.

704
00:38:53,055 --> 00:38:54,563
You have struggled a lot.

705
00:38:57,152 --> 00:38:58,250
It's strange but,

706
00:38:59,233 --> 00:39:01,710
your situation
is the same as Mr Kapoor's.

707
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,498
Are you out of your mind?

708
00:39:03,833 --> 00:39:05,095
At this age?
- Mom.

709
00:39:05,185 --> 00:39:07,505
Mom, I know what you are thinking.

710
00:39:08,282 --> 00:39:09,938
But, I believe that,

711
00:39:10,028 --> 00:39:13,448
at any age,
a person needs a companion.

712
00:39:15,118 --> 00:39:16,915
But Hardy?
- Mom.

713
00:39:18,102 --> 00:39:20,117
I have already spoken
to Mr. Kapoor and Bobby.

714
00:39:20,498 --> 00:39:21,670
And they are open to the alliance.

715
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,835
And I don't care
about what others think.

716
00:39:25,035 --> 00:39:26,558
You have stayed alone for long, mom.

717
00:39:27,593 --> 00:39:29,053
I must think of you.

718
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:31,328
And I will fulfil my duty.

719
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:36,148
I am arranging your marriage
to Mr. Kapoor.

720
00:39:36,238 --> 00:39:37,073
And that's final.

721
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:39,385
I love you, mom.

722
00:39:46,982 --> 00:39:48,807
Hello. Yeah?

723
00:39:49,465 --> 00:39:51,362
Amrita, here.
- Hi, Ms Amrita. I am Hardy.

724
00:39:51,767 --> 00:39:53,387
Mr. Patel gave me your number.

725
00:39:53,477 --> 00:39:55,298
Oh, yeah, yeah. Hardy, sir.

726
00:39:55,388 --> 00:39:56,832
Mr. Patel told me about you.

727
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,183
You wish to arrange a weeding,
right?

728
00:39:59,997 --> 00:40:02,055
Tell me.
Should I drop by your office?

729
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:05,053
No, I am coming...
Towards your office.

730
00:40:05,143 --> 00:40:07,302
You needn't come. I'll be there.

731
00:40:11,327 --> 00:40:13,445
Madam, this way please.
- Sure, thank you.

732
00:40:13,768 --> 00:40:14,933
You are most welcome.

733
00:40:15,658 --> 00:40:17,680
Do you know Amrita?
I want to do things differently.

734
00:40:17,893 --> 00:40:19,360
A wedding is a once
in a lifetime affair.

735
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:21,030
Yes, of course.

736
00:40:21,382 --> 00:40:23,800
That's why I have thought
of many things for my wedding.

737
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:25,750
But sir, don't you think...

738
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,272
If the bride wears a bikini
for the 'bidai' ceremony,

739
00:40:27,362 --> 00:40:29,077
it will be a bit too different?

740
00:40:29,167 --> 00:40:30,168
I mean to say,

741
00:40:30,258 --> 00:40:32,485
I have never seen
such a set-up before?

742
00:40:32,575 --> 00:40:34,103
Yes! That's why it's different!

743
00:40:34,193 --> 00:40:36,083
When Shampi's bride appears
in a bikini during the 'bidai',

744
00:40:36,173 --> 00:40:37,855
then people will stare in shock!

745
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,700
That is anyway bound to happen.

746
00:40:41,688 --> 00:40:43,682
Everyone in London
will only talk about this...

747
00:40:43,772 --> 00:40:45,778
That Shampi's bride was wearing
a bikini at the 'bidai.'

748
00:40:45,868 --> 00:40:49,112
But sir, are you sure that the bride
will wear a bikini at the 'bidai'?

749
00:40:49,202 --> 00:40:50,807
Yes. As our elders say,

750
00:40:50,897 --> 00:40:52,615
a bride should leave the maternal
home with two pieces of cloth.

751
00:40:52,705 --> 00:40:55,012
And I will do it.
You know, in a two-piece?

752
00:40:55,638 --> 00:40:56,858
Yes, of course.

753
00:40:56,948 --> 00:40:58,610
Do you have any other requirements?

754
00:40:59,388 --> 00:41:01,900
I'll make a list
and I will see you in the office.

755
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:03,768
Okay, then. Thank you.

756
00:41:03,858 --> 00:41:05,030
Bye.
- Bye-bye.

757
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,202
'Idiot!'

758
00:41:12,212 --> 00:41:13,838
Hello.
- Hey, listen.

759
00:41:13,928 --> 00:41:15,488
I'll reach office a bit late.

760
00:41:15,578 --> 00:41:18,095
A client called Shampi will come.
Just attend to him.

761
00:41:18,185 --> 00:41:20,140
He is a bit weird but handle him.

762
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:22,528
Weird meaning?
- You won't believe it,

763
00:41:22,618 --> 00:41:25,182
he wants his bride to wear
a bikini during the 'bidai.'

764
00:41:25,272 --> 00:41:27,363
Who makes a bride wear a bikini
at the 'bidai' ma'am?

765
00:41:28,032 --> 00:41:29,447
What a strange man!

766
00:41:29,537 --> 00:41:31,022
I had the same reaction.

767
00:41:31,112 --> 00:41:32,450
He is a first class idiot!

768
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,275
Make him sit if he comes.

769
00:41:34,365 --> 00:41:36,782
I will finish another meeting
Down-town before coming.

770
00:41:36,872 --> 00:41:39,112
Okay, ma'am I will handle. Okay.

771
00:41:39,202 --> 00:41:40,743
Okay. Thank you, bye.

772
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:45,765
Oh! Hey!

773
00:41:46,778 --> 00:41:48,723
Hi!
- Hi.

774
00:41:49,913 --> 00:41:52,470
You?
- Actually, Ms Amrita asked me to...

775
00:41:52,983 --> 00:41:56,413
Oh, Ms Amrita. Please, have a seat.

776
00:41:57,293 --> 00:41:58,948
Would you like
to have some tea or coffee?

777
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:00,428
I am fine.

778
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:03,375
That... I am sorry
for what happened the other day.

779
00:42:03,465 --> 00:42:05,083
Absolutely, no problem.

780
00:42:05,433 --> 00:42:08,005
May I say something,
if you don't mind?

781
00:42:08,095 --> 00:42:09,692
Yes, please. Why not?

782
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:12,873
This thing you have thought
for the brides 'bidai'...

783
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:14,295
Isn't it a bit weird?

784
00:42:14,385 --> 00:42:16,075
What is weird about it?
It's a good thing.

785
00:42:16,165 --> 00:42:18,903
Hey, you will have so many guests,

786
00:42:18,993 --> 00:42:21,198
who will look at
the bride with strange eyes.

787
00:42:22,943 --> 00:42:24,057
So what?

788
00:42:24,147 --> 00:42:25,940
I want people to see the bride.

789
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:28,512
And learn that
we must respect women.

790
00:42:28,995 --> 00:42:30,615
Hey, you don't understand?

791
00:42:30,705 --> 00:42:32,293
People will not just look
at the bride,

792
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:33,957
they will stare at her!

793
00:42:34,243 --> 00:42:36,090
And you will see strange reactions,

794
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,848
in their eyes for you. And that too,

795
00:42:37,938 --> 00:42:39,630
very bad and filthy!

796
00:42:40,245 --> 00:42:41,593
It makes no difference to me.

797
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:44,428
I know that whatever I am doing
is the right thing to do.

798
00:42:44,518 --> 00:42:45,990
What is right about it?

799
00:42:46,335 --> 00:42:49,662
Hey, what will the bride think
of her 'bidai'?

800
00:42:49,752 --> 00:42:52,242
Ah! You needn't worry about that.

801
00:42:52,548 --> 00:42:53,948
I have sought
the bride's permission.

802
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:55,063
She is pleased.

803
00:42:56,645 --> 00:42:58,785
That means the bride
is as senseless as you are?

804
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:00,148
What?

805
00:43:00,793 --> 00:43:01,810
Are you out of your mind?

806
00:43:02,493 --> 00:43:04,047
I out of my mind!

807
00:43:04,137 --> 00:43:05,417
I out of my mind!

808
00:43:05,507 --> 00:43:06,693
What are you implying?

809
00:43:06,783 --> 00:43:08,305
I don't have brains! Huh?

810
00:43:08,685 --> 00:43:11,213
You lecher! You senseless man!

811
00:43:11,303 --> 00:43:12,585
You animal!
- Ouch!

812
00:43:12,675 --> 00:43:14,153
You...
- Mind your language!

813
00:43:14,243 --> 00:43:17,150
What language? You have not
heard my language yet!

814
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,582
Dog! Scoundrel!
- Dog!

815
00:43:19,893 --> 00:43:20,720
Scoundrel!

816
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:22,655
I am respecting you
because you are a woman,

817
00:43:22,745 --> 00:43:24,185
and you are misbehaving with me?

818
00:43:24,275 --> 00:43:25,630
Respect! Respect!

819
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,073
You will respect women?

820
00:43:27,535 --> 00:43:31,118
The other day I let you go
because you look like Happy.

821
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,450
I should have taught you
a lesson that day.

822
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,728
I should have crushed
your bones! - Ouch!

823
00:43:35,818 --> 00:43:37,150
You lecher!
- I am not a lecher!

824
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,678
You want your bride to wear
a bikini at the 'bidai,' right?

825
00:43:39,768 --> 00:43:41,143
I will make you wear a bikini first!

826
00:43:41,233 --> 00:43:42,587
I will show you, come!
- No way! I am not...

827
00:43:42,677 --> 00:43:43,855
Then you will know that...
- 'Heer!'

828
00:43:43,945 --> 00:43:45,753
Then you will realise how a bride...
- Heer!

829
00:43:45,843 --> 00:43:47,445
Wears a bikini at the 'bidai'!
- Listen, listen.

830
00:43:47,535 --> 00:43:48,478
Have you lost your mind?

831
00:43:48,568 --> 00:43:50,677
This is not that client.
This is Hardy.

832
00:43:50,767 --> 00:43:51,912
He is Shampi.

833
00:43:53,007 --> 00:43:54,768
'She is over smart!'

834
00:43:57,705 --> 00:43:58,818
I am not a leech!

835
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:01,443
Sir! Sir!

836
00:44:01,533 --> 00:44:02,770
Oh, dear God!

837
00:44:06,455 --> 00:44:07,625
Sorry, sir!
- Huh!

838
00:44:07,715 --> 00:44:10,235
Actually, I said a lot
of unpleasant things, sir.

839
00:44:10,325 --> 00:44:11,995
Actually, I am really sorry, sir.

840
00:44:12,165 --> 00:44:14,598
I was confused.
I was confused again!

841
00:44:14,688 --> 00:44:16,350
Actually,
I said so many things to you.

842
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,000
Lech! a garbage man!

843
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:19,728
Sir,
Amrita ma'am told me later that,

844
00:44:19,818 --> 00:44:21,728
you are not a filthy man,
you are a perfect human being.

845
00:44:21,818 --> 00:44:23,817
You are arranging your
mother's wedding, sir.

846
00:44:23,907 --> 00:44:25,025
I am really sorry, huh!

847
00:44:25,115 --> 00:44:28,130
Please, forgive me.
Please, I am really sorry, sir.

848
00:45:19,917 --> 00:45:23,325
"My love is a passionate tale..."

849
00:45:23,415 --> 00:45:26,885
"My love is a passionate tale..."

850
00:45:26,975 --> 00:45:30,373
"Listen to me, oh, Heer!"

851
00:45:30,463 --> 00:45:33,862
"My love is a passionate tale..."

852
00:45:33,952 --> 00:45:37,430
"My love is a passionate tale..."

853
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:40,925
"Listen to me, oh, Heer!"

854
00:45:41,015 --> 00:45:44,435
"My love is a passionate tale..."

855
00:45:44,525 --> 00:45:47,968
"Love is my religion and God."

856
00:45:48,058 --> 00:45:51,500
"Love is my relation,
like a prayer."

857
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:55,032
"Listen to me, oh, Heer!"

858
00:45:55,122 --> 00:45:58,520
"My love is a passionate tale..."

859
00:45:58,610 --> 00:46:02,118
"My love is a passionate tale..."

860
00:46:03,885 --> 00:46:10,780
"In your eyes, I see,"

861
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:17,223
"the dreams I have for my life."

862
00:46:17,963 --> 00:46:21,385
"Listen to me, oh, Heer."

863
00:46:21,475 --> 00:46:24,888
"My love is a passionate tale..."

864
00:46:24,978 --> 00:46:28,420
"My love is a passionate tale..."

865
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:31,930
"Listen to me, oh, Heer."

866
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:35,448
"My love is a passionate tale..."

867
00:46:35,538 --> 00:46:39,090
"My love is a passionate tale..."

868
00:46:57,718 --> 00:47:01,330
"You soothe me in the harsh sun..."

869
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:04,893
"I draw warmth
from you in winter..."

870
00:47:04,983 --> 00:47:08,483
"My soul draws courage from you."

871
00:47:08,573 --> 00:47:11,730
"You are my love."

872
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:15,167
"You are my medicine
and you are in my wound."

873
00:47:15,257 --> 00:47:17,607
"You are in all my prayers,"

874
00:47:17,697 --> 00:47:22,583
"Oh, my Lord! Oh, my Lord!"

875
00:47:23,008 --> 00:47:25,800
"Oh, dear God!"

876
00:47:26,548 --> 00:47:30,000
"To be with a companion
is like praying."

877
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:33,518
"Love is ones nature,
like an intoxicant."

878
00:47:33,608 --> 00:47:36,975
"Listen to me, oh, Heer!"

879
00:47:37,065 --> 00:47:40,515
"My love is a passionate tale..."

880
00:47:40,605 --> 00:47:44,118
"My love is a passionate tale..."

881
00:47:48,768 --> 00:47:52,440
"My tears are for your happiness."

882
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:55,928
"A moment feels
like several centuries."

883
00:47:56,018 --> 00:47:59,490
"Days feel like nights..."

884
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:02,672
"The sweet things you say..."

885
00:48:02,762 --> 00:48:06,233
"You are in my thoughts
and in the air around me."

886
00:48:06,323 --> 00:48:08,623
"You are in the clouds..."

887
00:48:08,713 --> 00:48:13,598
"Oh, my Lord! Oh, my Lord!"

888
00:48:14,003 --> 00:48:16,773
"Oh my Lord!"

889
00:48:17,563 --> 00:48:20,985
"Love is like
the passion of nature..."

890
00:48:21,075 --> 00:48:24,488
"Love is like a blame
as though penance."

891
00:48:24,578 --> 00:48:28,013
"Listen to me, Oh, Heer."

892
00:48:28,103 --> 00:48:31,523
"My love is a passionate tale..."

893
00:48:31,613 --> 00:48:35,050
"My love is a passionate tale..."

894
00:48:58,110 --> 00:48:59,892
Brother, you failed.

895
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:01,468
Huh?

896
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:16,033
Change it!
- Yeah, yeah.

897
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:21,597
Hello! Yeah, Heer is coming.

898
00:49:21,687 --> 00:49:23,488
I can't believe Heer,
you are coming!

899
00:49:23,578 --> 00:49:24,587
Don't believe.

900
00:49:24,677 --> 00:49:27,152
When I come
and ring your doorbell tomorrow,

901
00:49:27,242 --> 00:49:28,363
then believe it.

902
00:49:28,583 --> 00:49:30,290
Once you come here,
we won't let you go.

903
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:31,943
Both of us will kidnap you.

904
00:49:32,775 --> 00:49:33,743
Both of you means?

905
00:49:33,833 --> 00:49:35,725
The two of us? I mean...

906
00:49:35,815 --> 00:49:38,048
Me and my husband. The two of us.

907
00:49:38,138 --> 00:49:39,375
Oh, okay, Charles?

908
00:49:39,465 --> 00:49:42,840
Okay, do you have any news
on Happy?

909
00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:44,570
News on Happy?

910
00:49:45,208 --> 00:49:47,737
That Happy is a first-class dog
and scoundrel!

911
00:49:48,043 --> 00:49:50,140
He fought with you,
and he isn't talking to us either.

912
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:51,452
Let him not talk to us.

913
00:49:51,542 --> 00:49:53,035
We don't want to talk to him,
either.

914
00:49:53,125 --> 00:49:55,350
Yes, right.
- Okay, I'll see you then.

915
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,473
We will chat when
I come tomorrow.

916
00:49:57,563 --> 00:49:59,108
Okay bye.
- Bye.

917
00:50:00,083 --> 00:50:01,490
My Heer is coming!

918
00:50:02,252 --> 00:50:04,493
Besides abuse, what else,
did Heer say about me?

919
00:50:04,583 --> 00:50:06,912
She said,
she won't come if Happy is there.

920
00:50:07,002 --> 00:50:08,048
Hey, don't lie.

921
00:50:08,138 --> 00:50:10,290
My Heer can never say something
like that about me. - Aww!

922
00:50:10,745 --> 00:50:11,653
Oh, my Heer's lover.

923
00:50:11,743 --> 00:50:13,090
I know everything! I know it all!

924
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:15,215
When she finds out that you
are already here,

925
00:50:15,305 --> 00:50:16,645
then what will she do? Tell me?

926
00:50:16,735 --> 00:50:19,737
She may hug me and say,
I love you, Happy.

927
00:50:20,153 --> 00:50:22,000
What if she says that
and draws my life out!

928
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:22,893
You don't worry.

929
00:50:22,983 --> 00:50:24,638
If she doesn't say that
and kill you,

930
00:50:24,728 --> 00:50:25,898
then after seeing
your art college results,

931
00:50:25,988 --> 00:50:28,053
she will surely kill you!
- Who will tell her?

932
00:50:29,623 --> 00:50:31,665
Yours truly.
- Madam...

933
00:50:31,755 --> 00:50:33,708
Buddy, don't do this.

934
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:36,145
My sweetheart, have some ice cream.

935
00:50:36,235 --> 00:50:37,860
My baby.
- Get lost, scoundrel!

936
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:39,230
Please, I am a scoundrel.
- Here, here...

937
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:40,615
Okay, I'll massage here as well.
- Yeah, yeah.

938
00:50:40,705 --> 00:50:42,258
Now, I will think about it.
- Don't tell.

939
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,955
Idiot!
- "Hey! Happy Singh!"

940
00:50:53,213 --> 00:50:54,958
Hey, Heer.

941
00:50:55,347 --> 00:50:56,600
Hi.

942
00:50:57,933 --> 00:50:58,973
Come.

943
00:51:03,752 --> 00:51:06,353
Hardy, I am angry with you.
- Why so?

944
00:51:06,632 --> 00:51:08,288
You are neither coming
to Manchester with me,

945
00:51:08,378 --> 00:51:10,010
nor are you dropping me
at the airport?

946
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,633
Do you know I was so excited
about introducing you to Lats?

947
00:51:12,723 --> 00:51:13,945
That's not fine.

948
00:51:14,035 --> 00:51:15,828
Heer had it not been for the music
launch for kids,

949
00:51:16,437 --> 00:51:17,880
I would definitely,
have come with you.

950
00:51:18,415 --> 00:51:19,698
The driver will drop you.

951
00:51:19,788 --> 00:51:21,815
And I will come
to Manchester tomorrow to meet you.

952
00:51:21,978 --> 00:51:23,905
Please, Heer. I am really sorry.
- Okay.

953
00:51:24,125 --> 00:51:25,355
Okay, let me treat you

954
00:51:25,445 --> 00:51:26,873
to some mind-blowing coffee
to fix your mood.

955
00:51:26,963 --> 00:51:28,280
We still have time
before your flight.

956
00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:29,878
Alright? I'll just get it for you.

957
00:51:30,392 --> 00:51:31,542
Wait.

958
00:51:32,612 --> 00:51:33,865
Let me treat you to coffee, today.

959
00:51:33,955 --> 00:51:35,390
You? Which one?
- Yes.

960
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:36,760
Do you like cafe latte?

961
00:51:37,705 --> 00:51:38,783
It's so strange,

962
00:51:38,873 --> 00:51:40,527
back in Punjab we kick people
with 'latte,'

963
00:51:40,617 --> 00:51:42,248
and here people drink latte.

964
00:51:43,883 --> 00:51:46,293
How do you manage to distort
English to that level.

965
00:51:46,383 --> 00:51:48,252
But you are so cute. I love you.

966
00:51:48,342 --> 00:51:50,692
You too. I'll get you some latte.

967
00:51:50,782 --> 00:51:52,575
Latte and 'pilate'
an interesting quote.

968
00:51:52,665 --> 00:51:53,865
Mind-blowing.

969
00:51:56,583 --> 00:51:57,727
Small?

970
00:51:58,122 --> 00:51:59,730
Yes, papa.

971
00:52:00,730 --> 00:52:02,885
Your daughter will be
at the airport on time.

972
00:52:03,463 --> 00:52:06,483
She is treating me to coffee.
Just don't worry. Chill.

973
00:52:07,202 --> 00:52:08,257
Bye.

974
00:52:37,208 --> 00:52:38,688
Here is the latte.

975
00:52:39,188 --> 00:52:41,078
Try is quickly,
and tell me how is it?

976
00:52:42,032 --> 00:52:43,058
What's wrong?

977
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:45,643
What were you checking on my phone?

978
00:52:46,150 --> 00:52:47,322
Why? Can't I see?

979
00:52:47,412 --> 00:52:48,707
Yes, of course, you can.

980
00:52:48,797 --> 00:52:50,663
I haven't hidden anything from you?

981
00:52:50,753 --> 00:52:51,837
Actually...

982
00:52:53,653 --> 00:52:56,028
You have never spoken about him?

983
00:52:57,428 --> 00:52:59,392
This... he is my friend, Happy.

984
00:52:59,482 --> 00:53:00,820
Actually, he is my best friend.

985
00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:03,188
Sometime back
I had a fight with him.

986
00:53:03,278 --> 00:53:06,075
Hey, he is the reason I slapped
you in the market.

987
00:53:06,165 --> 00:53:08,538
Do you remember?
We never spoke about it.

988
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:10,407
I didn't think it was
that important.

989
00:53:10,497 --> 00:53:12,818
There are so many
lovey-dovey messages...

990
00:53:13,573 --> 00:53:14,988
You seem to be very close...

991
00:53:16,048 --> 00:53:18,577
And he is not important for you,
huh?

992
00:53:19,595 --> 00:53:21,068
Ah! Which flavour is this?

993
00:53:21,158 --> 00:53:22,358
Hardy, just a minute.

994
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:24,557
What did you mean
when you said that?

995
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,163
Let it go, Heer.
- No.

996
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,428
Please, tell me whatever
is there in your heart.

997
00:53:30,518 --> 00:53:31,710
It's not a problem, Heer.

998
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:34,245
Let's not discuss this topic, Heer.
- No.

999
00:53:34,875 --> 00:53:36,773
I know, you have some doubt?

1000
00:53:37,023 --> 00:53:38,165
You don't trust me, hardy?

1001
00:53:38,255 --> 00:53:39,638
No. I... I trust you.

1002
00:53:39,728 --> 00:53:40,898
Swear on me.

1003
00:53:41,383 --> 00:53:43,630
Heer, what is the need to swear?

1004
00:53:45,435 --> 00:53:46,658
It is required, Hardy.

1005
00:53:47,553 --> 00:53:50,008
A relationship weakens due
to lack of trust.

1006
00:53:50,558 --> 00:53:52,735
And I don't want to live my life
on a compromise like that.

1007
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:55,050
Trust means a lot in love.

1008
00:53:55,335 --> 00:53:57,965
And a relationship has
no meaning without trust.

1009
00:53:58,977 --> 00:54:01,820
If you have faith in me,
when you come tomorrow,

1010
00:54:02,553 --> 00:54:04,363
please, come
without any emotional baggage.

1011
00:54:05,097 --> 00:54:06,892
And if you have the slightest doubt,

1012
00:54:07,523 --> 00:54:08,842
about me and you,

1013
00:54:09,355 --> 00:54:12,248
then I think... We should break up.

1014
00:54:14,588 --> 00:54:17,838
Because, my self-respect
is very important to me.

1015
00:54:18,648 --> 00:54:19,842
Now, I am getting late,

1016
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:22,700
I'll leave.

1017
00:54:54,115 --> 00:54:56,900
Are you crazy, Hardy?
Why did you do that?

1018
00:54:57,823 --> 00:54:58,758
I felt possessive.

1019
00:54:58,848 --> 00:54:59,890
It happens
when you are in a relationship.

1020
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:01,282
Things do go wrong at times.

1021
00:55:01,847 --> 00:55:03,818
I don't know,
I felt jealous for a moment.

1022
00:55:03,908 --> 00:55:05,913
I shouldn't have messed with her.

1023
00:55:06,610 --> 00:55:08,252
I unnecessarily hurt Heer...

1024
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:09,885
Don't worry.

1025
00:55:10,538 --> 00:55:12,113
It is not a big problem.

1026
00:55:12,788 --> 00:55:15,133
One tends to feel possessive
when in a relationship.

1027
00:55:16,853 --> 00:55:18,995
You give her a call.
Things will settle down.

1028
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:20,388
Call her. Call.

1029
00:55:20,623 --> 00:55:21,735
No, she is on the flight.

1030
00:55:22,615 --> 00:55:24,920
I go and talk to her face-to-face.

1031
00:55:25,547 --> 00:55:26,602
I'll get a bag.

1032
00:55:28,338 --> 00:55:29,995
'MANCHESTER (U.K.)'

1033
00:55:40,108 --> 00:55:41,038
Lats.

1034
00:55:41,128 --> 00:55:43,962
Please, buddy. Don't tell Heer,
I failed in an arts college.

1035
00:55:44,598 --> 00:55:45,640
Okay.

1036
00:55:45,730 --> 00:55:48,102
Where are your feet?
You are an angel.

1037
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,652
Hey, don't butter me.
I think she is here. She is calling.

1038
00:55:50,742 --> 00:55:52,360
Yeah, Heer.
- 'Yes, I am coming.'

1039
00:55:52,450 --> 00:55:53,965
Yeah, yeah, I am right here.

1040
00:55:54,055 --> 00:55:56,015
Come to channel eight. Okay, bye.

1041
00:55:56,105 --> 00:55:57,298
'Happy Singh.'

1042
00:56:00,223 --> 00:56:01,453
Hi!

1043
00:56:02,833 --> 00:56:05,103
I love you, Heer. I love you, Heer.

1044
00:56:05,193 --> 00:56:07,170
How are you, fatso?
- I love you, Heer!

1045
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:11,095
I love you, Heer.
- Welcome to Manchester.

1046
00:56:12,198 --> 00:56:14,345
Is Happy here?
- I love you, Heer.

1047
00:56:14,732 --> 00:56:16,843
No.
- Yeah, let it be!

1048
00:56:16,933 --> 00:56:19,472
I can smell that local
ten rupee Bhatinda perfume,

1049
00:56:19,562 --> 00:56:20,808
from a distance.

1050
00:56:20,898 --> 00:56:21,943
Where is the animal?

1051
00:56:22,033 --> 00:56:24,705
Hey, where are you? Happy.

1052
00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:26,473
Happy.

1053
00:56:26,563 --> 00:56:29,043
Come out animal or else,
I'll slap you.

1054
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:30,505
One second. I love you, Heer, six.

1055
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:31,638
I love you, Heer, seven.
- Happy!

1056
00:56:31,728 --> 00:56:34,145
I love you, Heer, eight.
I love you, Heer, nine.

1057
00:56:34,235 --> 00:56:35,668
I love you, Heer, ten!

1058
00:56:35,888 --> 00:56:38,420
Dog, scoundrel! Animal!
- Ah! Ouch!

1059
00:56:38,510 --> 00:56:39,768
Can't you call?

1060
00:56:39,858 --> 00:56:41,352
Where did you go
without informing me?

1061
00:56:41,442 --> 00:56:43,528
Can't you make a phone call? Huh?

1062
00:56:43,858 --> 00:56:44,855
Ouch! Heer!

1063
00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:46,587
The balance on my phone was over.

1064
00:56:46,677 --> 00:56:48,570
Your balance was over, is it? Huh?

1065
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:51,193
Today, I'll break your legs
and spoil your balance!

1066
00:56:51,283 --> 00:56:52,110
Heer!

1067
00:56:53,613 --> 00:56:54,947
I also, have hands.

1068
00:56:55,350 --> 00:56:57,003
Yeah! So, what will you do
with your hands?

1069
00:56:57,093 --> 00:56:57,928
What will you do?

1070
00:56:58,018 --> 00:57:00,172
Buddy! I will fall on your feet!

1071
00:57:00,993 --> 00:57:03,397
I will die without you, my friend.
I will die without you.

1072
00:57:03,685 --> 00:57:05,497
I'm Sorry!

1073
00:57:46,625 --> 00:57:47,655
Heer, coffee.

1074
00:57:54,910 --> 00:57:56,290
Whose call are you waiting for?

1075
00:57:57,190 --> 00:57:58,090
No one.

1076
00:57:58,597 --> 00:58:00,443
What were you doing in Manchester
all this while?

1077
00:58:00,722 --> 00:58:02,452
Hey, I...
- He is trying to be John constable.

1078
00:58:02,767 --> 00:58:04,253
Hey, why would I become a constable?

1079
00:58:04,343 --> 00:58:06,510
I will be a painter.
That's why I joined art school.

1080
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,900
Silly, John constable
is also a painter.

1081
00:58:08,990 --> 00:58:12,132
Ah! I mean... Wouldn't I know that
John constable is a painter.

1082
00:58:12,222 --> 00:58:13,370
I know it.

1083
00:58:13,583 --> 00:58:15,518
I was talking about
John constable because,

1084
00:58:15,608 --> 00:58:18,485
he is not a painter like me.
- Had he been a painter like you,

1085
00:58:18,575 --> 00:58:20,420
then he would not have been
a painter in the first place! Happy!

1086
00:58:20,510 --> 00:58:22,808
Okay, you tell me, do you have
any hope of passing.

1087
00:58:23,330 --> 00:58:24,728
What are you saying, Heer?

1088
00:58:24,818 --> 00:58:27,705
I have passed in a way that,
that no one could match up to me.

1089
00:58:27,795 --> 00:58:29,560
Yes, Heer.
If you see his report card,

1090
00:58:29,650 --> 00:58:31,263
you will get a shock!

1091
00:58:32,015 --> 00:58:34,125
Wow! My loser!

1092
00:58:34,215 --> 00:58:37,097
Honestly! You have broken
the record for the best loser!

1093
00:58:44,563 --> 00:58:46,650
Listen, Happy.
This is a perfect time...

1094
00:58:47,287 --> 00:58:49,363
There aren't too many people around.
I say go for it.

1095
00:58:49,838 --> 00:58:50,943
Tell her what is in your heart.

1096
00:58:51,413 --> 00:58:52,718
Be a man, Happy.

1097
00:58:52,808 --> 00:58:55,070
I have to go, huh.
I'll call Charles. Okay.

1098
00:58:56,118 --> 00:58:57,027
Ready?

1099
00:58:59,057 --> 00:59:00,208
Yeah!
- All the best.

1100
00:59:00,298 --> 00:59:01,275
Bye.

1101
00:59:08,293 --> 00:59:09,528
I have something
to say to you, Heer.

1102
00:59:09,618 --> 00:59:11,280
Yeah, so then speak up, animal!

1103
00:59:11,370 --> 00:59:13,347
And why are you talking
in such a serious tone?

1104
00:59:14,087 --> 00:59:16,513
I love you, Heer.
- I love you too, animal.

1105
00:59:16,603 --> 00:59:19,260
And this time, if you go off
somewhere without informing me,

1106
00:59:19,350 --> 00:59:21,788
then watch,
I will break my friendship with you,

1107
00:59:21,878 --> 00:59:23,892
and along with that,
I will also break your legs.

1108
00:59:24,075 --> 00:59:25,482
This is not that love.

1109
00:59:26,098 --> 00:59:27,527
This is not the friend zone, love.

1110
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:30,603
This is that love that
Romeo felt for Juliet.

1111
00:59:30,693 --> 00:59:33,690
If you want to be thrashed,
why do you have to be Romeo?

1112
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:35,672
I'll anyway throw stones at you.

1113
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:42,255
I will die without you, Heer.

1114
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:45,998
I love you very much.

1115
00:59:47,318 --> 00:59:48,703
Are you serious, Happy?

1116
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:49,978
I love you.

1117
00:59:51,407 --> 00:59:53,642
Since when?
- Ever since we were kids.

1118
00:59:54,793 --> 00:59:56,742
That is why I joined
the art college,

1119
00:59:57,833 --> 00:59:59,527
so that I can make something
of myself, for your sake.

1120
01:00:04,973 --> 01:00:06,005
Look, Happy...

1121
01:00:08,088 --> 01:00:09,297
I am really sorry.

1122
01:00:10,697 --> 01:00:11,613
I am,

1123
01:00:12,638 --> 01:00:14,127
in love with someone else.

1124
01:00:15,675 --> 01:00:18,698
After you left,
Hardy came into my life.

1125
01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:22,693
I didn't realise when
I fell in love with him?

1126
01:00:24,805 --> 01:00:28,138
Look, knowingly or unknowingly,
I have hurt your feelings.

1127
01:00:29,083 --> 01:00:31,100
I will never be able
to forgive myself.

1128
01:00:31,305 --> 01:00:32,917
Look, Happy, I am really sorry.

1129
01:00:33,825 --> 01:00:35,665
I hope you understand?

1130
01:00:42,525 --> 01:00:43,788
Yeah!

1131
01:00:47,853 --> 01:00:48,813
Did you see it!

1132
01:00:49,913 --> 01:00:52,068
Caught you!
I got you to blurt it out!

1133
01:00:54,522 --> 01:00:56,222
I have performed a miracle, buddy!

1134
01:00:56,312 --> 01:00:57,937
Wow! I am an actor par excellence!

1135
01:00:58,130 --> 01:00:59,002
I got you to blurt everything.

1136
01:00:59,092 --> 01:01:00,705
Hey, I have known you since
we were kids.

1137
01:01:01,975 --> 01:01:04,605
The minute I saw your face
I realised you are up to something.

1138
01:01:04,965 --> 01:01:06,285
And you blurted out everything!

1139
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:08,563
Superb!

1140
01:01:08,813 --> 01:01:11,033
So, what was all this?
- Acting!

1141
01:01:11,633 --> 01:01:14,103
Full-on acting! Serious acting!

1142
01:01:14,463 --> 01:01:15,590
Okay, tell me something.

1143
01:01:16,807 --> 01:01:18,675
Why didn't you tell Lats
about Hardy?

1144
01:01:19,807 --> 01:01:21,070
Hey, buddy!

1145
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:24,260
You, destroyed my surprise!

1146
01:01:24,678 --> 01:01:26,642
And what would you know,
the kind of effort it takes,

1147
01:01:26,732 --> 01:01:28,188
to keep a secret?

1148
01:01:28,613 --> 01:01:30,487
How would I know? Come on.

1149
01:01:40,015 --> 01:01:42,425
Happy. Happy.
Do you think this is a joke?

1150
01:01:42,953 --> 01:01:44,118
Why did you go back on your words
in front of her?

1151
01:01:46,323 --> 01:01:49,650
Lats had I not taken my words back,
would my fate have changed?

1152
01:01:51,308 --> 01:01:54,238
Heer just said,
Hardy is a great achiever.

1153
01:01:55,315 --> 01:01:56,635
He looks like me,

1154
01:01:58,540 --> 01:01:59,992
but the guy has a golden fate.

1155
01:02:01,302 --> 01:02:03,588
Anyway, people call me a loser.
I don't matter.

1156
01:02:05,310 --> 01:02:06,335
You had once said,

1157
01:02:06,858 --> 01:02:10,493
that even if I run a solo race,
I will come last.

1158
01:02:11,137 --> 01:02:12,280
So, I have come last.

1159
01:02:13,775 --> 01:02:14,948
I am sorry, Happy.

1160
01:02:15,038 --> 01:02:17,070
Hey, no problem.
It is not your fault.

1161
01:02:18,267 --> 01:02:20,178
While looking after the 'Taj Mahal',

1162
01:02:20,817 --> 01:02:22,128
the gatekeeper begins to think

1163
01:02:22,218 --> 01:02:23,895
think that the 'Taj Mahal'
is his property...

1164
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:27,220
But the papers remain
on Shah Jahan's name, right?

1165
01:02:28,585 --> 01:02:29,625
Don't worry.

1166
01:02:30,908 --> 01:02:31,975
I am okay.

1167
01:03:05,298 --> 01:03:10,780
"Yours and mine..."

1168
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:14,158
"Our tale of love."

1169
01:03:17,105 --> 01:03:22,133
"Yours and mine..."

1170
01:03:22,660 --> 01:03:25,980
"Our tale of love."

1171
01:03:28,530 --> 01:03:34,312
"At times in the fragrant wind,
at times amid humid clouds,"

1172
01:03:34,402 --> 01:03:39,442
"And at times, it is a holy prayer."

1173
01:03:40,313 --> 01:03:45,598
"At times like the harsh Sun,
and sometimes like a cool shade..."

1174
01:03:46,242 --> 01:03:51,313
"And at times like a cold wind..."

1175
01:03:52,565 --> 01:03:57,980
"Yours and mine..."

1176
01:03:58,070 --> 01:04:01,292
"Our tale of love."

1177
01:04:10,283 --> 01:04:15,722
"Yours and mine..."

1178
01:04:15,812 --> 01:04:19,107
"Our tale of love."

1179
01:04:19,197 --> 01:04:24,083
"Yours and mine..."

1180
01:04:24,668 --> 01:04:28,003
"Our tale of love."

1181
01:04:31,498 --> 01:04:36,710
"I love you."

1182
01:04:37,428 --> 01:04:42,338
"I am crazy about you."

1183
01:04:43,225 --> 01:04:48,247
"You mean the world to me."

1184
01:04:49,170 --> 01:04:54,433
"I live because you do."

1185
01:04:54,523 --> 01:04:59,908
"Only you, my heart
and the Lord knows,"

1186
01:05:00,422 --> 01:05:05,528
"It will be tough for me to survive
without you."

1187
01:05:05,618 --> 01:05:08,505
"My heart will always
carry your memories."

1188
01:05:08,595 --> 01:05:11,488
"My world is incomplete
without you."

1189
01:05:11,578 --> 01:05:15,495
"There is no other like you."

1190
01:05:17,833 --> 01:05:23,598
"At times in the fragrant wind,
at times amid humid clouds,"

1191
01:05:23,688 --> 01:05:27,732
"And at times, it is a holy prayer."

1192
01:05:28,085 --> 01:05:29,558
'MANCHESTER (U.K.)'

1193
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:35,317
"Yours and mine..."

1194
01:05:35,537 --> 01:05:39,032
"Our tale of love."

1195
01:05:42,973 --> 01:05:45,773
Okay, tell me,
which way should we go?

1196
01:05:51,190 --> 01:05:52,033
Yes, mom.

1197
01:05:53,425 --> 01:05:55,588
I have reached.
- Harry, have you met Heer?

1198
01:05:55,678 --> 01:05:56,840
Have you spoken to her?

1199
01:05:56,930 --> 01:05:58,093
Heer is right in front of me.

1200
01:05:58,827 --> 01:06:00,552
Can you believe it,
I am following her?

1201
01:06:01,142 --> 01:06:02,138
And she is not even aware of it.

1202
01:06:02,228 --> 01:06:04,667
Hardy, she must be waiting
for your phone call.

1203
01:06:04,757 --> 01:06:07,293
The flavour of waiting in love,
is something else!

1204
01:06:07,693 --> 01:06:09,988
Honestly, you really bother her!

1205
01:06:10,078 --> 01:06:11,175
One second.

1206
01:06:11,445 --> 01:06:12,513
Oh, mom.

1207
01:06:13,058 --> 01:06:14,600
You just hold on; Heer is calling.

1208
01:06:14,690 --> 01:06:16,135
I will tease her some more.

1209
01:06:18,048 --> 01:06:19,895
Hi, Heer. Tell me.
- 'Hi, Hardy.'

1210
01:06:19,985 --> 01:06:21,345
Have you reached Manchester?

1211
01:06:21,435 --> 01:06:22,790
No, Heer.
I have thought a lot.

1212
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:24,980
'There are too many problems
in our relationship.'

1213
01:06:28,037 --> 01:06:30,477
I don't think we should continue
to see each other.

1214
01:06:30,567 --> 01:06:31,575
We should break up.

1215
01:06:32,397 --> 01:06:33,473
You were right when you said,

1216
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:36,653
the most important thing
in love is trust.

1217
01:06:37,583 --> 01:06:39,738
And I feel that,

1218
01:06:41,205 --> 01:06:42,650
we are not made for each other.

1219
01:06:43,460 --> 01:06:44,735
Are you serious?

1220
01:06:44,825 --> 01:06:45,828
Yeah, I am serious.

1221
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:48,018
I am saying this after giving
it a lot of thought.

1222
01:06:49,808 --> 01:06:51,025
We should separate.

1223
01:06:51,663 --> 01:06:54,005
And you should forget me. Bye!

1224
01:06:55,357 --> 01:06:56,398
Heer.

1225
01:06:56,940 --> 01:06:58,065
What's wrong Heer?
- Huh.

1226
01:07:01,197 --> 01:07:03,783
Hardy just broke up with me.

1227
01:07:03,873 --> 01:07:05,785
What? But why?

1228
01:07:09,927 --> 01:07:11,560
I will never call him again.

1229
01:07:15,070 --> 01:07:16,053
Don't cry.

1230
01:07:20,993 --> 01:07:22,143
Can you believe it?

1231
01:07:23,923 --> 01:07:26,137
I told Heer that we should break up.

1232
01:07:26,448 --> 01:07:27,727
Now, I am feeling guilty that,

1233
01:07:28,650 --> 01:07:29,663
why am I teasing her?

1234
01:07:30,598 --> 01:07:31,625
But you know how I am.

1235
01:07:31,715 --> 01:07:33,500
Poor thing. This is very bad.

1236
01:07:33,590 --> 01:07:35,597
Hardy, you harass her a lot!

1237
01:07:35,687 --> 01:07:36,807
This is not right.

1238
01:07:36,897 --> 01:07:38,198
'No, mom this will be great fun,'

1239
01:07:38,288 --> 01:07:39,803
when I give her a surprise.

1240
01:07:39,893 --> 01:07:41,130
She will be thrilled.

1241
01:07:41,628 --> 01:07:43,365
I meet her then I'll make
a video call to you.

1242
01:07:43,455 --> 01:07:45,337
Okay. Be careful. Take care.

1243
01:07:45,427 --> 01:07:46,465
Bye.

1244
01:07:50,048 --> 01:07:51,690
Flowers for you?
- How much?

1245
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:52,972
Ten pence.

1246
01:07:55,303 --> 01:07:56,175
Yeah.

1247
01:07:57,157 --> 01:07:59,115
Here you go.
- Thank you.

1248
01:07:59,350 --> 01:08:00,308
Thank you.

1249
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:22,083
"Yours and mine..."

1250
01:08:22,173 --> 01:08:26,305
"Our tale of love."

1251
01:08:32,495 --> 01:08:33,698
Hey, Nandu.

1252
01:08:33,788 --> 01:08:35,780
You are standing
outside the hospital, and smoking?

1253
01:08:35,870 --> 01:08:37,165
My wife is ill, she is inside.

1254
01:08:37,458 --> 01:08:38,608
What's wrong with her?

1255
01:08:39,275 --> 01:08:40,720
She has some gynaecological problem.

1256
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:43,087
Gynaecological problem?

1257
01:08:43,177 --> 01:08:44,768
I'm spending so much...
- How much did the cigarette cost?

1258
01:08:46,290 --> 01:08:48,005
Ten rupees.
- Ten rupees?

1259
01:08:48,378 --> 01:08:50,343
And, how many do you have
in your pocket? - One more.

1260
01:08:50,433 --> 01:08:51,853
You have money to buy death,

1261
01:08:51,943 --> 01:08:54,790
but you don't have any money
to save your wife from death?

1262
01:08:55,245 --> 01:08:56,350
What do you mean?

1263
01:08:57,758 --> 01:08:59,788
Look, what is written on it.
It says, 'death.'

1264
01:09:00,457 --> 01:09:02,390
And, this sanitary pad, says 'life'.

1265
01:09:03,552 --> 01:09:04,390
Don't laugh.

1266
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:07,512
you can save your wife from
an infection that can occur,

1267
01:09:07,602 --> 01:09:10,545
during periods due to using a cloth.

1268
01:09:10,635 --> 01:09:11,880
You can save her.

1269
01:09:11,970 --> 01:09:13,235
And if you don't smoke,

1270
01:09:13,325 --> 01:09:15,618
you can save yourself from cancer.

1271
01:09:15,708 --> 01:09:17,122
That means you can buy two lives

1272
01:09:17,212 --> 01:09:18,695
with what you spend on buying,
'death'...

1273
01:09:18,785 --> 01:09:20,710
One, yours and the other,
your wife's.

1274
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:22,308
Think, and then laugh!

1275
01:09:23,775 --> 01:09:26,720
There is nothing macho
about smoking cigarettes.

1276
01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:28,208
But, it takes courage to buy these.

1277
01:09:33,047 --> 01:09:34,900
Uncle, but all I am saying is...

1278
01:09:39,870 --> 01:09:40,902
Thanks.

1279
01:09:46,670 --> 01:09:47,803
You don't speak uncle.

1280
01:09:47,893 --> 01:09:49,382
You are asking me not
to take the stress...

1281
01:09:49,472 --> 01:09:51,295
I know how worried you are for Heer.

1282
01:09:51,742 --> 01:09:53,038
I am tense, dear.

1283
01:09:53,787 --> 01:09:54,995
But I know,

1284
01:09:55,545 --> 01:09:59,385
I believe if time causes a wound,
it also, heals it.

1285
01:10:02,822 --> 01:10:04,053
And that Happy!

1286
01:10:04,143 --> 01:10:05,313
He should have been here
to support her,

1287
01:10:05,403 --> 01:10:06,940
he is sulking like a child!

1288
01:10:10,170 --> 01:10:12,318
Happy, your name is,

1289
01:10:12,408 --> 01:10:13,842
not complimenting your face, at all!

1290
01:10:13,932 --> 01:10:15,255
Oh, Jaspreet, be specific.

1291
01:10:15,345 --> 01:10:16,488
You are confusing the fellow.

1292
01:10:16,578 --> 01:10:18,348
Should he change his name
or his face?

1293
01:10:18,438 --> 01:10:19,442
Now, I will explain it to you.

1294
01:10:19,532 --> 01:10:21,485
Look, son, you are
sad because you are heartbroken...

1295
01:10:21,735 --> 01:10:23,178
And you are more unhappy
because Heer is unhappy,

1296
01:10:23,268 --> 01:10:24,908
But what is your name? Happy Singh.

1297
01:10:24,998 --> 01:10:27,128
And the name Happy Singh doesn't go
with the expression on your face.

1298
01:10:27,218 --> 01:10:28,355
Tell him.
- Yeah.

1299
01:10:28,445 --> 01:10:29,285
Uncle.

1300
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:32,405
I know how it feels when
the heart breaks.

1301
01:10:32,495 --> 01:10:33,872
Heer is passing through
a painful phase,

1302
01:10:34,890 --> 01:10:37,278
and she is in pain
and it doesn't bother me...

1303
01:10:37,712 --> 01:10:39,125
I am not so selfish.

1304
01:10:39,215 --> 01:10:42,020
But, son...
Heer should also, consider,

1305
01:10:42,328 --> 01:10:44,805
that the person who has loved
her since childhood,

1306
01:10:45,150 --> 01:10:46,593
she ignored him.

1307
01:10:46,945 --> 01:10:49,297
And the one she fell for,
he broke her heart.

1308
01:10:49,387 --> 01:10:51,085
Now, isn't this Heer's fault?

1309
01:10:51,175 --> 01:10:52,733
Right said. Yes.

1310
01:10:52,823 --> 01:10:54,185
Whoever is at fault,

1311
01:10:55,555 --> 01:10:58,310
all I know is Heer is upset.
That's it.

1312
01:10:58,588 --> 01:11:00,787
Hey, son! Son!

1313
01:11:01,285 --> 01:11:03,513
Thank God that this
has happened now.

1314
01:11:03,603 --> 01:11:04,957
I mean if,

1315
01:11:05,047 --> 01:11:07,257
the heart breaks after
a long term relationship,

1316
01:11:07,347 --> 01:11:09,345
I swear on God,
it causes a lot of pain.

1317
01:11:09,435 --> 01:11:10,525
Should I tell you something?

1318
01:11:10,855 --> 01:11:13,105
That guy does not deserve Heer.

1319
01:11:13,195 --> 01:11:14,013
Am I right or not, Preeto?

1320
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:15,428
Absolutely correct.
- Whether she does or not,

1321
01:11:15,518 --> 01:11:17,105
Heer doesn't deserve all this.

1322
01:11:17,722 --> 01:11:19,217
Heer doesn't deserve this...

1323
01:11:19,307 --> 01:11:21,430
You won't do anything.

1324
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:24,383
So, will you walk around that
unhappy look on your face?

1325
01:11:24,675 --> 01:11:25,702
Not like gum...

1326
01:11:26,558 --> 01:11:29,315
I will turn into glue
and fix Heer's heart.

1327
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:31,623
That's like our boy!

1328
01:11:32,208 --> 01:11:34,282
Now, look... Look...
Does his name,

1329
01:11:34,372 --> 01:11:36,062
match his expression or not?
- Of course!

1330
01:11:36,152 --> 01:11:38,040
Isn't it! Yeah.

1331
01:11:38,333 --> 01:11:39,580
Oh, your face reminds me...

1332
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:41,528
Make some carrot pudding
in the evening today,

1333
01:11:42,605 --> 01:11:43,690
with extra sugar.

1334
01:11:44,315 --> 01:11:47,370
Why would my face remind you
of carrot pudding, uncle?

1335
01:11:47,612 --> 01:11:49,180
Son, there is no meaning to it.

1336
01:11:49,450 --> 01:11:51,488
Oh, son, one who likes to eat,

1337
01:11:51,810 --> 01:11:54,338
just needs an excuse to eat!

1338
01:11:54,428 --> 01:11:57,995
Whether or not you are hungry,
you must eat!

1339
01:11:58,085 --> 01:12:00,428
The mission to help Heer,

1340
01:12:00,518 --> 01:12:02,128
begins from today, uncle.
- Absolutely!

1341
01:12:34,903 --> 01:12:41,190
"That which one can't get over,"

1342
01:12:42,745 --> 01:12:46,653
"is not a healthy feeling."

1343
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:53,598
"Accept the fact that love,"

1344
01:12:55,473 --> 01:12:58,972
"is the harbinger of trouble."

1345
01:12:59,062 --> 01:13:01,532
"You are my world of dreams."

1346
01:13:01,622 --> 01:13:04,068
"My soul is addicted to you."

1347
01:13:04,158 --> 01:13:06,603
"You are my world of dreams."

1348
01:13:06,693 --> 01:13:08,998
"My soul is addicted to you."

1349
01:13:09,088 --> 01:13:13,943
"Your companionship is addictive."

1350
01:13:15,098 --> 01:13:19,660
"You are my worst habit."

1351
01:13:20,187 --> 01:13:24,338
"You are my worst habit."

1352
01:13:24,428 --> 01:13:26,890
"When you are upset,"

1353
01:13:26,980 --> 01:13:30,447
"I feel I'll die..."

1354
01:13:32,832 --> 01:13:37,610
"You are my worst habit."

1355
01:13:37,895 --> 01:13:42,052
"You are my worst habit."

1356
01:13:42,142 --> 01:13:44,595
"You are my world of dreams."

1357
01:13:44,685 --> 01:13:46,998
"My soul is addicted to you."

1358
01:13:47,088 --> 01:13:51,853
"Your companionship is addictive."

1359
01:13:53,075 --> 01:13:57,837
"You are my worst habit."

1360
01:13:58,128 --> 01:14:02,363
"You are my worst habit."

1361
01:14:02,453 --> 01:14:04,883
"When you are upset,"

1362
01:14:04,973 --> 01:14:08,230
"When you are upset,"

1363
01:14:10,825 --> 01:14:15,528
"You are my worst habit."

1364
01:14:15,855 --> 01:14:20,400
"You are my worst habit."

1365
01:14:40,788 --> 01:14:46,668
"I am sure I have
to live with you..."

1366
01:14:48,140 --> 01:14:54,393
"My heart prays to be with you."

1367
01:14:55,613 --> 01:15:01,653
"Now, I'll spend my life
in worshipping you."

1368
01:15:03,965 --> 01:15:08,777
"You are my worst habit."

1369
01:15:09,033 --> 01:15:13,195
"You are my worst habit."

1370
01:15:13,285 --> 01:15:15,763
"You are my world of dreams."

1371
01:15:15,853 --> 01:15:18,140
"My soul is addicted to you."

1372
01:15:18,230 --> 01:15:23,128
"Your companionship is addictive."

1373
01:15:24,233 --> 01:15:28,878
"You are my worst habit."

1374
01:15:29,297 --> 01:15:34,067
"You are my worst habit."

1375
01:15:34,602 --> 01:15:42,107
"Dear, your love feels
like a miracle..."

1376
01:15:42,197 --> 01:15:49,755
"I think of you every moment.
You are my first and last wish."

1377
01:15:52,435 --> 01:15:53,388
'Dear, God,'

1378
01:15:53,615 --> 01:15:55,908
'the way you have filled
Lats world with happiness,'

1379
01:15:56,310 --> 01:15:58,653
'I request you to please give
Heer her share of happiness.'

1380
01:15:59,432 --> 01:16:01,532
'It was not in my fate to have
a mom and dad...'

1381
01:16:02,033 --> 01:16:03,598
'You haven't given me any talent.'

1382
01:16:04,368 --> 01:16:06,102
'But I have no grievance.'

1383
01:16:06,795 --> 01:16:09,282
'But please grace Heer's fate
with happiness.'

1384
01:16:09,808 --> 01:16:12,805
'Please, dear, God. Please,
fulfil my wish.'

1385
01:16:13,903 --> 01:16:15,800
'Tomorrow I am travelling
back to Punjab with Heer.'

1386
01:16:16,863 --> 01:16:18,353
'Please, do something so that,'

1387
01:16:18,443 --> 01:16:20,220
'Heer starts laughing again.'

1388
01:16:29,550 --> 01:16:35,677
"I feel at peace
when you are close to me."

1389
01:16:37,233 --> 01:16:43,257
"Whenever I think of you,
I experience heaven."

1390
01:16:44,395 --> 01:16:50,203
"Your mistakes will kill me."

1391
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:57,560
"You are my worst habit."

1392
01:16:57,910 --> 01:17:02,027
"You are my worst habit."

1393
01:17:02,117 --> 01:17:04,605
"You are my world of dreams."

1394
01:17:04,695 --> 01:17:07,023
"My soul is addicted to you."

1395
01:17:07,113 --> 01:17:11,993
"Your companionship is addictive."

1396
01:17:13,090 --> 01:17:17,685
"You are my worst habit."

1397
01:17:18,137 --> 01:17:22,823
"You are my worst habit."

1398
01:17:52,182 --> 01:17:53,538
Look at this, Heer.

1399
01:17:54,183 --> 01:17:55,848
A painting on 'Sholay!'

1400
01:17:56,953 --> 01:17:58,290
How can it be a painting
on 'Sholay,'

1401
01:17:58,380 --> 01:17:59,738
I don't see Jai and Veeru in it?

1402
01:17:59,828 --> 01:18:01,823
Not Jai and Veeru.
This is the scene where,

1403
01:18:01,913 --> 01:18:04,393
Gabbar kidnapped Basanti.

1404
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:05,557
So, where is Basanti?

1405
01:18:05,647 --> 01:18:08,382
How can Basanti be here?
Gabbar has kidnapped her!

1406
01:18:08,472 --> 01:18:09,453
So then, where is Gabbar?

1407
01:18:09,543 --> 01:18:11,870
How can Gabbar stay back
at the kidnapping spot?

1408
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:14,730
While will he wait at the spot
after kidnapping Basanti?

1409
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:16,637
Then how can this
be a painting on 'Sholay?'

1410
01:18:16,727 --> 01:18:18,318
This is a painting on
'Sholay' because,

1411
01:18:18,408 --> 01:18:19,628
this is that road,

1412
01:18:19,718 --> 01:18:21,730
from which,
Gabbar escaped with Basanti!

1413
01:18:21,820 --> 01:18:24,677
And these are marks
of the cart on the road!

1414
01:18:24,990 --> 01:18:26,463
Rubbish!
- Yeah!

1415
01:18:26,553 --> 01:18:31,050
"You are my worst habit."

1416
01:18:31,593 --> 01:18:36,125
"You are my worst habit."

1417
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:41,163
"You are my worst habit."

1418
01:18:54,430 --> 01:18:56,733
'Kada prasad.'

1419
01:18:56,975 --> 01:18:58,112
'Kada prasad.'

1420
01:19:10,618 --> 01:19:11,482
My, dear.

1421
01:19:12,023 --> 01:19:13,945
Yes.
- Had we waited for a day or two,

1422
01:19:14,035 --> 01:19:15,558
then we could have tasted
our Golu's jaggery.

1423
01:19:15,648 --> 01:19:16,613
Papa,

1424
01:19:16,848 --> 01:19:18,790
Amrita has called me twice.

1425
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:20,598
We have to catch
the flight tomorrow evening.

1426
01:19:20,688 --> 01:19:22,873
So that I can organise
the event on Sunday.

1427
01:19:22,963 --> 01:19:24,710
That of course, you will.

1428
01:19:25,405 --> 01:19:28,620
But have you thought of organising
your own life?

1429
01:19:29,218 --> 01:19:31,563
What does that mean?
- I spent my time in a way that,

1430
01:19:31,653 --> 01:19:33,633
while waiting
for the delivery of an iPhone...

1431
01:19:33,723 --> 01:19:36,383
I kept waiting
for the courier guy to call...

1432
01:19:36,473 --> 01:19:38,025
After throwing the old phone
in the garbage bin!

1433
01:19:38,115 --> 01:19:40,040
This was a bad one, huh!

1434
01:19:40,130 --> 01:19:41,217
Worse than the first one?

1435
01:19:41,307 --> 01:19:43,380
But the meaning made sense,
didn't it?

1436
01:19:44,778 --> 01:19:45,662
But what does it mean?

1437
01:19:45,752 --> 01:19:48,593
This is it?
We don't understand life.

1438
01:19:49,390 --> 01:19:52,062
We look for something
that we don't have,

1439
01:19:52,152 --> 01:19:54,110
and that which is close,
is not important to us.

1440
01:19:54,460 --> 01:19:56,628
And by the time we understand
the value of the one close to us,

1441
01:19:56,718 --> 01:19:58,255
by then, he becomes the past.

1442
01:19:58,503 --> 01:20:00,048
Papa,
whatever it is that you want to say,

1443
01:20:00,138 --> 01:20:01,683
say it straightforwardly.

1444
01:20:01,773 --> 01:20:02,625
Okay, dear.

1445
01:20:02,715 --> 01:20:05,097
I have seen affection for you
in Happy's eyes.

1446
01:20:05,565 --> 01:20:07,365
I know, he loves me.

1447
01:20:07,455 --> 01:20:08,670
He is my best friend.

1448
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:11,865
Dear, this is not
the love of a friend...

1449
01:20:12,178 --> 01:20:13,418
But like that of a husband...

1450
01:20:13,508 --> 01:20:15,948
And that too, such a husband,
who is like a rubber band.

1451
01:20:16,038 --> 01:20:17,595
The farther he goes from you,

1452
01:20:17,685 --> 01:20:19,610
he will come back to you
at the same speed.

1453
01:20:19,700 --> 01:20:22,085
Didn't you see what happened,

1454
01:20:22,175 --> 01:20:23,338
when the goon teased you.
And that what Happy did...

1455
01:20:23,428 --> 01:20:25,058
A person no one expects
anything from.

1456
01:20:25,748 --> 01:20:27,233
If you marry him,

1457
01:20:27,822 --> 01:20:29,637
you will stay happy all your life.

1458
01:20:30,072 --> 01:20:31,765
That is what I feel, child.

1459
01:20:31,855 --> 01:20:32,988
The rest is up to you.

1460
01:20:33,820 --> 01:20:37,395
"A tale of love."

1461
01:20:43,368 --> 01:20:44,680
Uncle is right, Heer.

1462
01:20:45,310 --> 01:20:47,050
Happy has loved you
since you were kids.

1463
01:20:47,813 --> 01:20:49,665
And except you,
everyone else knows that.

1464
01:20:50,377 --> 01:20:52,505
In fact, he did confess
his love to you.

1465
01:20:53,142 --> 01:20:54,903
But after he found out about Hardy,

1466
01:20:55,138 --> 01:20:56,887
he brushed
his feelings aside as a joke.

1467
01:21:15,283 --> 01:21:18,858
"A tale of love."

1468
01:21:50,390 --> 01:21:51,548
Happy.

1469
01:21:51,638 --> 01:21:53,367
Yeah, tell me.
- I have something to say to you.

1470
01:21:55,285 --> 01:21:56,945
Yeah, tell me.
- Happy, I love you.

1471
01:21:57,035 --> 01:21:58,678
I love you too, but right now,
I am working.

1472
01:21:58,768 --> 01:22:00,285
Hey, Happy animal...

1473
01:22:00,375 --> 01:22:02,087
This is not the friend zone love,

1474
01:22:02,177 --> 01:22:04,195
I truly love you.

1475
01:22:04,525 --> 01:22:07,410
I also love you. But let me work.

1476
01:22:07,830 --> 01:22:09,445
A few days are left
for the exhibition,

1477
01:22:09,535 --> 01:22:11,032
what will I do if the painting
is not done by then?

1478
01:22:11,122 --> 01:22:12,295
You can marry me.

1479
01:22:13,260 --> 01:22:15,862
Marry me. Earlier it was nothing!

1480
01:22:16,367 --> 01:22:18,890
You would say, do something,
you walk around like a loser.

1481
01:22:19,332 --> 01:22:21,525
Now, that I am doing something,
you still have a problem?

1482
01:22:22,203 --> 01:22:23,175
What do you want?

1483
01:22:23,265 --> 01:22:24,942
Look, I want that,

1484
01:22:25,032 --> 01:22:28,688
you should leave your painting brush
and hold my hand forever.

1485
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:32,058
I should hold your hand
and leave the painting brush!

1486
01:22:32,628 --> 01:22:35,507
Will the painting be ready
if I hold your hand? Huh?

1487
01:22:44,045 --> 01:22:45,022
You were saying something?

1488
01:22:45,112 --> 01:22:46,745
No, I did not say anything.

1489
01:22:48,362 --> 01:22:50,597
Okay, I must have misheard you.

1490
01:22:50,993 --> 01:22:52,875
Yes, why would I say that,

1491
01:22:52,965 --> 01:22:56,208
you leave your painting brush
and hold my hand forever?

1492
01:22:56,298 --> 01:22:57,743
After all there is no logic to it.

1493
01:22:58,143 --> 01:23:00,748
You are a loser
and I like achievers.

1494
01:23:00,838 --> 01:23:02,848
But happy, I love you.

1495
01:23:02,938 --> 01:23:04,358
Will you marry me?

1496
01:23:08,293 --> 01:23:10,235
What are you giving me
that surprised stare?

1497
01:23:12,202 --> 01:23:13,293
Hey!

1498
01:23:14,425 --> 01:23:16,993
Happy, I love you!

1499
01:23:17,853 --> 01:23:20,518
Why have you turned into a statue?
Say something!

1500
01:23:24,620 --> 01:23:29,327
"That which one can't get over,"

1501
01:23:29,608 --> 01:23:32,318
You start crying when there
is something to be happy about!

1502
01:23:32,408 --> 01:23:33,837
"is not a healthy feeling."

1503
01:23:34,213 --> 01:23:35,558
You are a weird guy!

1504
01:23:36,268 --> 01:23:38,598
And you start laughing when you
should weep!

1505
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:41,683
I love you! Will you marry me?

1506
01:23:42,708 --> 01:23:43,685
What?

1507
01:23:45,170 --> 01:23:46,408
Yes?

1508
01:23:47,573 --> 01:23:48,795
Say something.

1509
01:23:49,555 --> 01:23:52,393
Idiot! Is this something
to cry about,

1510
01:23:52,483 --> 01:23:53,767
or I'll refuse.

1511
01:23:55,018 --> 01:23:56,295
Should I refuse?

1512
01:23:57,650 --> 01:23:59,818
I love you! I love you. Happy!

1513
01:24:00,493 --> 01:24:02,023
I will go mad!

1514
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:05,495
I will lose my mind!

1515
01:24:07,283 --> 01:24:09,753
"You are my worst habit."

1516
01:24:09,843 --> 01:24:14,433
"You are my worst habit."

1517
01:24:14,888 --> 01:24:19,708
"You are my worst habit."

1518
01:24:36,540 --> 01:24:39,123
'Our Happy Singh, in his joy,'

1519
01:24:39,213 --> 01:24:41,407
'has organised an exhibition
of his paintings.'

1520
01:24:41,948 --> 01:24:43,570
'Let's see how the people react.'

1521
01:24:44,707 --> 01:24:45,655
Hi.
- Hello.

1522
01:24:45,745 --> 01:24:47,618
This is a river and then...

1523
01:24:47,900 --> 01:24:48,745
Yes, I can't understand...

1524
01:24:48,835 --> 01:24:50,670
I am not interested. Sorry!
- I'll pay you for this!

1525
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:52,193
Look at this
brilliant composition...

1526
01:24:52,283 --> 01:24:54,843
The way the Sun at the top
balances the ball at the bottom.

1527
01:24:54,933 --> 01:24:57,435
I really don't care
about that painting.

1528
01:25:00,673 --> 01:25:02,588
'Hey, Happy Singh!'

1529
01:25:02,678 --> 01:25:04,513
Ah, please.
- Yeah, sure.

1530
01:25:06,343 --> 01:25:07,535
Thank you.
- It's okay.

1531
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:12,967
Let me see, what is the feedback?

1532
01:25:13,322 --> 01:25:14,292
Yeah.

1533
01:25:15,730 --> 01:25:16,842
Is that a comment?

1534
01:25:16,932 --> 01:25:18,575
Yeah.
- Let's read the first comment?

1535
01:25:18,665 --> 01:25:20,018
Yeah, yeah.
- Yes.

1536
01:25:21,187 --> 01:25:25,452
Painter forgot to use one thing
in his paintings,

1537
01:25:26,060 --> 01:25:27,005
that is his mind.

1538
01:25:33,523 --> 01:25:35,170
Read the second comment.
- Yeah, yeah, the second one.

1539
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:36,117
Let me read it in Hindi,

1540
01:25:36,207 --> 01:25:37,280
it will be fun.
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

1541
01:25:39,352 --> 01:25:40,460
I realised for the first time

1542
01:25:40,550 --> 01:25:43,488
that we can murder someone
with a painting!

1543
01:25:44,380 --> 01:25:45,947
Stop it! Stop it! Papa.

1544
01:25:46,037 --> 01:25:47,305
At least, the poor guy...

1545
01:25:47,395 --> 01:25:48,602
I mean he worked hard.

1546
01:25:48,692 --> 01:25:49,613
After all he tried.
- Yes, yes.

1547
01:25:49,703 --> 01:25:52,860
Dear, Happy doesn't care for these
comments? What say, Happy?

1548
01:25:52,950 --> 01:25:54,600
Yeah, he doesn't.
- Yes, yes, please read.

1549
01:25:54,690 --> 01:25:56,710
I will just... This is the last one.

1550
01:25:58,017 --> 01:25:59,288
This painting is,

1551
01:26:01,155 --> 01:26:03,633
a weapon against,

1552
01:26:04,335 --> 01:26:05,580
humanity!

1553
01:26:06,445 --> 01:26:09,908
Before it hatches more eggs,
and others like this are born,

1554
01:26:10,783 --> 01:26:12,563
someone should murder this painter.

1555
01:26:12,653 --> 01:26:14,337
What? What is this nonsense?

1556
01:26:14,945 --> 01:26:16,988
The ordinary people,

1557
01:26:17,618 --> 01:26:20,035
are incapable of understanding
my painting.

1558
01:26:21,227 --> 01:26:23,375
I have resolved never
to paint again. - Yes.

1559
01:26:23,898 --> 01:26:25,788
This is good.
- Yes.

1560
01:26:26,717 --> 01:26:27,780
I have another idea.

1561
01:26:27,870 --> 01:26:29,560
No! - No!
- Oh, no!

1562
01:26:33,623 --> 01:26:34,563
What is this?

1563
01:26:51,315 --> 01:26:54,938
"Come and stay in my heart."

1564
01:26:55,028 --> 01:26:58,325
"Come and stay in my heart."

1565
01:26:58,415 --> 01:27:02,180
"Cutie pie! Cutie pie!"

1566
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:07,952
"If you don't come into my life,
I will die!"

1567
01:27:09,538 --> 01:27:13,360
"Cutie pie! Cutie pie!"

1568
01:27:16,988 --> 01:27:19,005
"Cutie pie! Cutie pie!"

1569
01:27:20,670 --> 01:27:22,698
"Cutie pie! Cutie pie!"

1570
01:27:24,420 --> 01:27:28,035
"You are my beauty queen.
You are the best."

1571
01:27:28,125 --> 01:27:33,798
"When I met you,
I felt you are an angel."

1572
01:27:34,328 --> 01:27:37,308
"I know not why! I know not why!"

1573
01:27:37,398 --> 01:27:41,070
"My life feels colourless
without you..."

1574
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:44,773
"Give me a chance, love.
Give me a high-five!"

1575
01:27:44,863 --> 01:27:48,468
"You give me a high-five! High-five!

1576
01:27:48,558 --> 01:27:51,850
"You are the one thing
I want, cutie pie."

1577
01:27:52,578 --> 01:27:56,247
"Come and stay in my heart."

1578
01:27:56,337 --> 01:27:59,600
"Come and stay in my heart."

1579
01:27:59,690 --> 01:28:03,455
"Cutie pie! Cutie pie!"

1580
01:28:04,065 --> 01:28:09,388
"If you don't come
into my life, I will die!"

1581
01:28:10,860 --> 01:28:14,603
"Cutie pie! Cutie pie!"

1582
01:28:22,020 --> 01:28:23,895
"Cutie pie! Cutie pie!"

1583
01:28:25,710 --> 01:28:27,718
"Cutie pie! Cutie pie!"

1584
01:28:29,418 --> 01:28:31,413
"Cutie pie! Cutie pie!"

1585
01:28:33,133 --> 01:28:34,948
"Cutie pie! Cutie pie!"

1586
01:28:38,557 --> 01:28:41,723
'And one day Happy's dream
was about to come true.'

1587
01:28:41,813 --> 01:28:44,220
'Heer and Happy's wedding date
was finally fixed.'

1588
01:28:52,582 --> 01:28:57,335
"This is an auspicious night,
listen to the drums beating!"

1589
01:28:57,425 --> 01:29:02,075
"The stars sing and the moon
gyrates to the music."

1590
01:29:02,295 --> 01:29:05,970
"Your coy smile
has stolen our heart."

1591
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:10,275
"I'll take you away!
I'll take you away!"

1592
01:29:10,365 --> 01:29:12,625
"I'll take you away!"

1593
01:29:12,715 --> 01:29:14,835
"I'll take you away."

1594
01:29:14,925 --> 01:29:19,567
"I'll take you away!"

1595
01:29:20,170 --> 01:29:24,382
"I'll take you away!"

1596
01:29:24,472 --> 01:29:29,068
"I'll steal you from the world!"

1597
01:29:29,158 --> 01:29:33,853
"I'll take you away."

1598
01:29:38,540 --> 01:29:42,892
"Yours and mine..."

1599
01:29:42,982 --> 01:29:45,757
"Our tale of love."

1600
01:29:47,918 --> 01:29:52,223
"Yours and mine..."

1601
01:29:52,313 --> 01:29:54,988
"Our tale of love."

1602
01:29:57,345 --> 01:30:01,180
"Yours and mine..."

1603
01:30:01,735 --> 01:30:04,447
"Our tale of love."

1604
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:11,108
"Yours and mine."

1605
01:30:11,198 --> 01:30:13,920
"Our tale of love."

1606
01:30:16,163 --> 01:30:20,465
"Yours and mine..."

1607
01:30:20,555 --> 01:30:23,458
"Our tale of love."

1608
01:30:25,562 --> 01:30:29,472
"Yours and mine..."

1609
01:30:29,948 --> 01:30:32,578
"Our tale of love."

1610
01:30:36,292 --> 01:30:37,263
I love you Heer.

1611
01:30:46,213 --> 01:30:47,132
Hi.

1612
01:30:56,095 --> 01:30:57,293
Why have you come here now?

1613
01:30:59,018 --> 01:31:00,542
I was in a coma for nine months.

1614
01:31:00,762 --> 01:31:02,958
'The day I told you that I want
to break up. That day,'

1615
01:31:04,590 --> 01:31:05,855
'I was joking.'

1616
01:31:06,218 --> 01:31:07,637
'I was standing right behind you.'

1617
01:31:08,573 --> 01:31:09,987
'I wanted to give you a surprise.'

1618
01:31:10,077 --> 01:31:11,567
'But I met with an accident.'

1619
01:31:18,628 --> 01:31:20,215
'Doctor?
- He is in a coma now,'

1620
01:31:20,305 --> 01:31:21,668
'and on life support.
- No!'

1621
01:31:22,253 --> 01:31:23,220
'Suhasini.'

1622
01:31:23,748 --> 01:31:25,615
I had no sensation of pain in those
nine months.

1623
01:31:31,428 --> 01:31:33,150
Mom didn't inform you because,

1624
01:31:34,690 --> 01:31:36,235
there was no hope for me.

1625
01:31:36,965 --> 01:31:38,707
'We must inform Heer.'

1626
01:31:40,105 --> 01:31:41,197
'I don't want,'

1627
01:31:42,878 --> 01:31:44,068
'that Heer's life,'

1628
01:31:45,333 --> 01:31:47,168
'should pass by looking at Hardy
in this condition,'

1629
01:31:48,540 --> 01:31:50,757
'waiting for him to recover.'

1630
01:31:51,318 --> 01:31:52,612
'Then a miracle took place.'

1631
01:31:54,948 --> 01:31:56,005
'I regained consciousness.'

1632
01:31:59,038 --> 01:32:01,253
'Doctor!
- I recovered.'

1633
01:32:02,063 --> 01:32:03,303
When I came out of coma,

1634
01:32:05,887 --> 01:32:07,192
then I felt the pain.

1635
01:32:08,208 --> 01:32:09,528
The pain of staying away from you.

1636
01:32:10,525 --> 01:32:11,488
'Hardy.'

1637
01:32:11,978 --> 01:32:12,882
'Son,'

1638
01:32:13,685 --> 01:32:15,847
'why don't you call Heer, once?'

1639
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:20,425
'No, mom. I wonder what
she thinks of me?'

1640
01:32:21,985 --> 01:32:23,685
'Tomorrow they
will release me from here.'

1641
01:32:24,663 --> 01:32:25,928
'I will meet her and speak to her.'

1642
01:32:30,325 --> 01:32:31,215
I don't know,

1643
01:32:32,053 --> 01:32:33,285
what was that prayer, Heer,

1644
01:32:34,523 --> 01:32:36,110
because of which I am standing
in front of you, today.

1645
01:32:41,145 --> 01:32:42,898
I shouldn't have played
the fool that day.

1646
01:32:56,620 --> 01:32:57,530
Heer.

1647
01:33:10,860 --> 01:33:13,420
He is Happy Singh, my fiance.

1648
01:33:22,120 --> 01:33:23,405
Sir, Harpreet Singh Lamba.

1649
01:33:24,188 --> 01:33:25,333
Harshvardhan Bhatt.

1650
01:34:09,125 --> 01:34:09,955
Sir,

1651
01:34:11,728 --> 01:34:13,768
this chocolate cake is the best
we can get here.

1652
01:34:15,388 --> 01:34:17,152
Do you like it?
- Yes.

1653
01:34:18,463 --> 01:34:19,440
Sir,

1654
01:34:20,405 --> 01:34:21,475
thank you very much.

1655
01:34:22,413 --> 01:34:23,530
You,

1656
01:34:24,917 --> 01:34:26,778
broke bread with us,

1657
01:34:27,628 --> 01:34:28,680
met our family...

1658
01:34:30,513 --> 01:34:32,408
I have one other request.

1659
01:34:33,575 --> 01:34:34,900
It is a holiday for Easter.

1660
01:34:36,132 --> 01:34:38,053
We are planning
to play indoor games here.

1661
01:34:39,238 --> 01:34:41,723
I request you to stay
back and join us.

1662
01:34:46,055 --> 01:34:47,473
Sir, please don't refuse.

1663
01:34:48,552 --> 01:34:49,448
Please.

1664
01:34:52,930 --> 01:34:54,283
Sir, you have Heer's swear.

1665
01:34:56,948 --> 01:34:58,885
Okay, mine too.

1666
01:35:02,512 --> 01:35:03,493
After all,
we owe each other this much

1667
01:35:03,583 --> 01:35:04,517
for having the same face.

1668
01:35:09,083 --> 01:35:10,248
Okay, Happy.

1669
01:35:12,485 --> 01:35:13,415
Thank you, sir.

1670
01:35:15,223 --> 01:35:16,388
Are you mad, Happy?

1671
01:35:16,478 --> 01:35:17,953
Didn't you see, everyone
was so uncomfortable?

1672
01:35:18,043 --> 01:35:19,655
What was the need to invite him?

1673
01:35:21,315 --> 01:35:23,237
He always comes
into my life without an invitation,

1674
01:35:24,710 --> 01:35:26,248
so, what will it matter,
if I asked him to stay?

1675
01:35:28,218 --> 01:35:29,088
Lats,

1676
01:35:30,333 --> 01:35:32,322
after finding out the truth
about Hardy's accident,

1677
01:35:33,118 --> 01:35:35,830
there are many other secrets that
we must find out.

1678
01:35:48,590 --> 01:35:49,568
There...

1679
01:35:50,083 --> 01:35:52,145
Heer is caught
in the game of truth and dare.

1680
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:53,892
And Heer always tells the truth.

1681
01:35:54,508 --> 01:35:55,780
A question for you Heer.

1682
01:35:55,870 --> 01:35:57,982
Are you upset that
Hardy sir came so late?

1683
01:36:10,353 --> 01:36:11,352
Yes.

1684
01:36:14,672 --> 01:36:17,272
I am upset because
Hardy has come late.

1685
01:36:33,430 --> 01:36:37,140
"Our closeness,"

1686
01:36:37,983 --> 01:36:42,563
"has a tale to narrate..."

1687
01:36:44,282 --> 01:36:52,718
"There are distances
that separate us."

1688
01:36:55,048 --> 01:37:02,245
"There are distances
that separate us."

1689
01:37:05,802 --> 01:37:13,622
"There are distances
that separate us."

1690
01:37:14,627 --> 01:37:17,547
"Complicated..."

1691
01:37:17,637 --> 01:37:24,152
"The ways of the heart
are complicated."

1692
01:37:25,215 --> 01:37:28,283
"Complicated..."

1693
01:37:28,373 --> 01:37:34,943
"The ways of the heart
are complicated."

1694
01:37:35,033 --> 01:37:43,378
"Our closeness has
a tale to narrate..."

1695
01:37:45,955 --> 01:37:54,235
"There are distances
that separate us."

1696
01:37:56,632 --> 01:38:04,097
"There are distances
that separate us."

1697
01:38:17,190 --> 01:38:20,103
Hardy, sir. I want to discuss
something important with you.

1698
01:38:22,565 --> 01:38:23,777
I have made up my mind,

1699
01:38:24,273 --> 01:38:25,965
that I,

1700
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:30,323
should step out
of your and Heer's path.

1701
01:38:32,413 --> 01:38:33,490
Heer is very honest.

1702
01:38:34,702 --> 01:38:35,625
She is a gem.

1703
01:38:36,790 --> 01:38:38,062
Just like Picasso's painting.

1704
01:38:39,108 --> 01:38:40,203
Heer always speaks the truth...

1705
01:38:41,503 --> 01:38:43,143
Regardless
of how unpalatable the truth is.

1706
01:38:45,795 --> 01:38:47,013
Today when she said that,

1707
01:38:49,772 --> 01:38:51,432
she is upset because you came late,

1708
01:38:51,727 --> 01:38:53,173
she spoke the truth, sir.

1709
01:38:54,383 --> 01:38:57,290
I have seen Heer weep for you.

1710
01:38:58,408 --> 01:39:00,028
I want her to be happy.

1711
01:39:02,218 --> 01:39:04,535
Anyway, the world calls me a loser,
sir.

1712
01:39:07,928 --> 01:39:09,448
And you are an achiever.

1713
01:39:10,312 --> 01:39:11,643
I have made up my mind, sir.

1714
01:39:13,552 --> 01:39:15,875
I will move out of your
and Heer's path. That's it.

1715
01:39:16,565 --> 01:39:17,703
Had this been a movie,

1716
01:39:22,590 --> 01:39:24,452
then I would have felt
sympathy for you.

1717
01:39:26,728 --> 01:39:30,275
And I would have told you that, no,
I should make the sacrifice...

1718
01:39:31,803 --> 01:39:33,420
And I should move out of the path.

1719
01:39:36,343 --> 01:39:38,478
But this is not a movie.

1720
01:39:40,748 --> 01:39:42,027
This is real life.

1721
01:39:43,860 --> 01:39:45,098
And reality is bitter.

1722
01:39:47,328 --> 01:39:48,398
The truth is,

1723
01:39:49,537 --> 01:39:50,555
Heer is mine.

1724
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:53,185
Had I been here,

1725
01:39:57,110 --> 01:39:59,473
then Heer would never have
agreed to marry you.

1726
01:40:02,105 --> 01:40:03,503
And now, that I am back,

1727
01:40:05,385 --> 01:40:07,653
then we must face the situation.

1728
01:40:08,130 --> 01:40:10,193
It is important to be
a good human being but,

1729
01:40:12,308 --> 01:40:15,080
just being a good human being,
being good at heart,

1730
01:40:15,723 --> 01:40:17,248
is not enough,

1731
01:40:18,380 --> 01:40:19,845
for a marriage to work.

1732
01:40:23,078 --> 01:40:24,873
Love is also, very important.

1733
01:40:26,775 --> 01:40:28,558
And Heer loves me.

1734
01:40:31,238 --> 01:40:32,668
This is the truth, Happy.

1735
01:40:34,348 --> 01:40:36,728
You are a very good man.
I respect you.

1736
01:40:38,448 --> 01:40:40,028
But you must step out of the way.

1737
01:40:43,008 --> 01:40:43,865
Right, sir.

1738
01:40:43,955 --> 01:40:49,028
"Why is the moon
attached to the stars?"

1739
01:40:49,550 --> 01:40:54,418
"This is the philosophy
every love story..."

1740
01:40:54,633 --> 01:41:00,250
"Why is love so difficult?"

1741
01:41:00,340 --> 01:41:05,232
"Why is it so tough to be in love?"

1742
01:41:06,238 --> 01:41:11,143
"I have fear in my eyes, and yet,"

1743
01:41:11,598 --> 01:41:16,645
"The heart feels
courageous for no reason."

1744
01:41:16,735 --> 01:41:25,972
"Though the picture is clear,
why does it seem blurred?"

1745
01:41:27,070 --> 01:41:30,083
"Complicated..."

1746
01:41:30,173 --> 01:41:36,670
"The ways of the heart
are complicated."

1747
01:41:37,822 --> 01:41:43,372
"Complicated..."

1748
01:41:43,462 --> 01:41:47,690
"The ways of the heart
are complicated."

1749
01:41:59,518 --> 01:42:00,970
I have made up my mind, Heer.

1750
01:42:01,418 --> 01:42:03,313
I will step out of your and Hardy,
sir's way.

1751
01:42:03,403 --> 01:42:04,880
It's simple logic,

1752
01:42:04,970 --> 01:42:06,375
You love Hardy, sir...

1753
01:42:09,365 --> 01:42:10,543
And today you said,

1754
01:42:12,383 --> 01:42:14,232
that you are upset because
he came late.

1755
01:42:14,687 --> 01:42:15,643
He is right, Heer.

1756
01:42:15,885 --> 01:42:18,677
He is aware of the fact that,
if you are his fiance today,

1757
01:42:19,598 --> 01:42:21,265
that is because I wasn't around.

1758
01:42:21,355 --> 01:42:22,383
Let's be practical.

1759
01:42:22,753 --> 01:42:25,720
It doesn't sound good,
but the world thinks he is a loser.

1760
01:42:28,993 --> 01:42:31,323
He hasn't worked and achieved
anything till date.

1761
01:42:31,413 --> 01:42:33,940
He failed art school.
He can't keep any job...

1762
01:42:34,030 --> 01:42:36,050
He lives off his uncle and aunt.

1763
01:42:36,533 --> 01:42:37,725
He is a very nice man.

1764
01:42:38,340 --> 01:42:39,753
I really respect him.

1765
01:42:40,390 --> 01:42:42,278
Of course, but...

1766
01:42:43,235 --> 01:42:45,310
In today's world only love,

1767
01:42:46,108 --> 01:42:50,323
respect and a good heart
is not enough to lead life.

1768
01:42:54,013 --> 01:42:55,290
You admire achievers.

1769
01:42:55,680 --> 01:42:58,210
This is a fact, he knows well.

1770
01:42:58,300 --> 01:42:59,878
Because when I spoke to him,

1771
01:43:00,740 --> 01:43:01,858
he accepted the fact,

1772
01:43:02,895 --> 01:43:03,793
that,

1773
01:43:04,697 --> 01:43:06,290
you are in love with
him on the rebound.

1774
01:43:08,078 --> 01:43:09,150
And,

1775
01:43:11,070 --> 01:43:13,568
he told me how much you missed me...

1776
01:43:14,378 --> 01:43:15,442
When I wasn't around.

1777
01:43:16,152 --> 01:43:17,293
You cried for me.

1778
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:21,680
And the truth is, Heer...

1779
01:43:22,290 --> 01:43:23,500
That what you said today...

1780
01:43:25,020 --> 01:43:26,955
That you are upset because
I have come late.

1781
01:43:27,372 --> 01:43:28,683
But I did not say that,

1782
01:43:29,218 --> 01:43:30,852
I am still in love with you.

1783
01:43:35,483 --> 01:43:37,118
No, Hardy. I don't love you.

1784
01:43:37,613 --> 01:43:39,915
I indeed had feelings for you.

1785
01:43:40,005 --> 01:43:42,723
And it is true that
I will never forget you.

1786
01:43:43,290 --> 01:43:45,040
But that is humanly impossible.

1787
01:43:46,317 --> 01:43:49,317
But that does not mean,
I still love you.

1788
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:54,743
Hardy,
What happened to you was wrong.

1789
01:43:55,710 --> 01:43:57,070
It was unfortunate.

1790
01:43:57,953 --> 01:43:59,023
But Heer?

1791
01:44:00,737 --> 01:44:02,083
You proposed to me,

1792
01:44:02,450 --> 01:44:04,238
but had Hardy, sir come before that?

1793
01:44:04,328 --> 01:44:06,187
Then I would have said yes to him,
Happy.

1794
01:44:06,635 --> 01:44:08,258
But this is also true,

1795
01:44:08,898 --> 01:44:11,590
that I waited long for him.
He didn't come.

1796
01:44:12,365 --> 01:44:14,147
And finally, I moved on.

1797
01:44:14,983 --> 01:44:16,643
And then I fell in love with you.

1798
01:44:18,450 --> 01:44:20,090
And what is the big deal, Happy?

1799
01:44:20,940 --> 01:44:22,150
Love is love.

1800
01:44:23,458 --> 01:44:25,897
And my love for you
can't dissipate because of this.

1801
01:44:26,718 --> 01:44:29,195
You are being stupid, Heer.
Please, understand.

1802
01:44:30,322 --> 01:44:32,095
Life is giving us a second chance.

1803
01:44:33,585 --> 01:44:34,887
I made the first mistake.

1804
01:44:35,938 --> 01:44:37,378
You are making the second mistake.

1805
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:40,303
What is the truth?
He is a loser, man!

1806
01:44:41,548 --> 01:44:42,893
And what are your dreams?

1807
01:44:42,983 --> 01:44:44,643
You wanted to get married
to an achiever.

1808
01:44:44,733 --> 01:44:45,685
I am in front of you.

1809
01:44:46,718 --> 01:44:47,895
And yet you are...

1810
01:44:49,328 --> 01:44:51,925
What will he do in life?
Come on, let's face facts.

1811
01:44:52,575 --> 01:44:54,262
He lives off his uncle and auntie.

1812
01:44:54,352 --> 01:44:56,953
He has some money, but for how long?
They will get over!

1813
01:44:57,268 --> 01:44:58,070
After that, what?

1814
01:44:58,160 --> 01:45:00,157
The same old tussle,
husband, wife, divorce!

1815
01:45:01,138 --> 01:45:03,213
He won't achieve anything,
and you have big dreams.

1816
01:45:03,303 --> 01:45:04,698
And I can fulfil your dreams,

1817
01:45:05,088 --> 01:45:06,138
not him!

1818
01:45:07,240 --> 01:45:08,595
How do people perceive him?

1819
01:45:09,025 --> 01:45:10,215
What does he have?

1820
01:45:12,090 --> 01:45:14,293
Please, understand.
You will really regret,

1821
01:45:15,203 --> 01:45:17,593
that you married a fool like him.

1822
01:45:19,053 --> 01:45:21,118
You are emotional
and getting carried away.

1823
01:45:21,590 --> 01:45:22,908
You have to be a bit practical.

1824
01:45:22,998 --> 01:45:26,663
Love, devotion and attachment....
Are very important.

1825
01:45:26,753 --> 01:45:28,973
But along with these,
success is very important.

1826
01:45:29,063 --> 01:45:30,192
And he doesn't have that.

1827
01:45:30,720 --> 01:45:31,978
He fails in everything.

1828
01:45:34,155 --> 01:45:36,358
I am not happy to say these things.

1829
01:45:39,832 --> 01:45:41,272
If you marry him,

1830
01:45:42,470 --> 01:45:45,080
you will divorce him later.

1831
01:45:45,170 --> 01:45:46,760
Thanks for saying this Hardy.

1832
01:45:46,850 --> 01:45:49,753
Now, I am regretting
that why did I tell Happy,

1833
01:45:50,195 --> 01:45:52,163
that I am upset because
you came late.

1834
01:45:54,130 --> 01:45:56,370
This selfish side of your character,

1835
01:45:57,625 --> 01:45:59,277
has hurt me, Hardy.

1836
01:46:01,120 --> 01:46:03,108
Had you really been in love me with,

1837
01:46:04,515 --> 01:46:06,168
you would have been happy
because I am happy.

1838
01:46:07,970 --> 01:46:10,373
I feel you should go from here.

1839
01:46:10,815 --> 01:46:12,402
I want you to be happy.

1840
01:46:12,492 --> 01:46:14,725
But when you are
getting carried away like this,

1841
01:46:15,508 --> 01:46:17,288
I am trying to reason with you.

1842
01:46:17,378 --> 01:46:18,760
You will not achieve
anything with him.

1843
01:46:18,850 --> 01:46:20,093
This is the truth!

1844
01:46:21,130 --> 01:46:23,185
You are making
the biggest mistake of your life.

1845
01:46:24,365 --> 01:46:25,498
Loser!

1846
01:46:30,275 --> 01:46:31,468
You will regret this.

1847
01:46:47,093 --> 01:46:49,188
Ah!
- Scoundrel! Animal!

1848
01:46:49,278 --> 01:46:52,012
Ah! Ouch!
- You! Dog, Scoundrel! Animal!

1849
01:46:52,885 --> 01:46:55,120
What do you think? Don't I love you?

1850
01:46:56,680 --> 01:46:59,198
Buddy, I was
simply thinking of your happiness.

1851
01:46:59,288 --> 01:47:00,932
My happiness! My happiness!
- Ouch!

1852
01:47:01,022 --> 01:47:02,818
Ouch!
- I am happy with you, idiot!

1853
01:47:03,268 --> 01:47:05,745
I did not expect this from you,
Happy.

1854
01:47:06,140 --> 01:47:08,510
I was under the impression
that you understand me.

1855
01:47:08,885 --> 01:47:10,525
Had I known that,

1856
01:47:10,615 --> 01:47:13,238
you will misunderstand
me because of my statement,

1857
01:47:13,645 --> 01:47:15,720
I would have made myself clear
then and there.

1858
01:47:16,243 --> 01:47:18,338
You have hurt me, Happy.

1859
01:47:18,680 --> 01:47:20,520
Are you the only one who can love?

1860
01:47:21,270 --> 01:47:23,725
Forgive me. I am really sorry.

1861
01:47:26,673 --> 01:47:27,525
This ring...

1862
01:47:27,615 --> 01:47:29,230
Put this ring on my finger,
cutie pie.

1863
01:47:29,432 --> 01:47:30,803
No!
- My baby!

1864
01:47:30,893 --> 01:47:31,962
I don't want to out
the ring on your finger.

1865
01:47:32,052 --> 01:47:34,922
I won't be able to wear the ring
on my own. Please. - No!

1866
01:47:35,012 --> 01:47:36,568
Please, buddy! Put it on me.
- No!

1867
01:47:36,658 --> 01:47:38,763
Yes. You have to put it on me.
Come on, do it!

1868
01:47:38,853 --> 01:47:40,237
No!
- Please, buddy. Put it on me.

1869
01:47:40,327 --> 01:47:41,743
No!
- I love you, buddy!

1870
01:47:41,833 --> 01:47:42,840
Put it on!
- No!

1871
01:47:42,930 --> 01:47:44,013
Yes!
- No!

1872
01:47:44,103 --> 01:47:45,512
No!
- Yes!

1873
01:47:45,602 --> 01:47:48,662
Yes!
- Yes. Yeah!

1874
01:47:49,665 --> 01:47:51,672
I love you. I love you.

1875
01:47:51,762 --> 01:47:53,795
Put it on.
Now, at least, put it on my finger.

1876
01:48:01,480 --> 01:48:06,085
"We are like a flock of birds..."

1877
01:48:06,175 --> 01:48:09,815
"We will fly away!"

1878
01:48:09,905 --> 01:48:14,533
"We are like a flock of birds..."

1879
01:48:14,623 --> 01:48:18,255
"We will fly away!"

1880
01:48:18,345 --> 01:48:23,820
"We have to fly far..."

1881
01:48:23,910 --> 01:48:28,500
"We have to fly far..."

1882
01:48:28,590 --> 01:48:32,263
"We will fly away!"

1883
01:48:32,353 --> 01:48:36,240
"We are like a flock of birds."

1884
01:48:51,375 --> 01:48:53,057
Here, tea.

1885
01:49:02,810 --> 01:49:03,840
Where is Heer?

1886
01:49:09,397 --> 01:49:10,287
She did not come, mom.

1887
01:49:11,483 --> 01:49:12,395
She is engaged,

1888
01:49:13,608 --> 01:49:15,007
to a childhood friend,

1889
01:49:16,005 --> 01:49:16,875
Happy.

1890
01:49:18,610 --> 01:49:19,553
Funny name!

1891
01:49:23,277 --> 01:49:24,877
I tried to talk to her.

1892
01:49:25,908 --> 01:49:28,230
She will live like a queen with me.

1893
01:49:28,733 --> 01:49:30,193
And if she stays with that loser,

1894
01:49:33,708 --> 01:49:34,953
they will separate in some time.

1895
01:49:35,043 --> 01:49:36,222
That's what I feel.

1896
01:49:39,505 --> 01:49:41,680
I am glad, mom.

1897
01:49:42,458 --> 01:49:45,580
A wrong girl like Heer
is out of our life.

1898
01:49:52,820 --> 01:49:53,732
Hardy.

1899
01:49:55,325 --> 01:49:56,810
The umbilical cord,

1900
01:49:57,975 --> 01:49:59,970
attaches a mother to her child.

1901
01:50:01,825 --> 01:50:02,748
That is why,

1902
01:50:03,403 --> 01:50:05,975
the way a mother
understands her child,

1903
01:50:07,822 --> 01:50:09,330
no one else can.

1904
01:50:12,488 --> 01:50:13,813
Heer did not understand,

1905
01:50:14,523 --> 01:50:18,948
that doesn't mean that
I won't understand either.

1906
01:50:24,905 --> 01:50:26,143
I had no option, mom.

1907
01:50:30,595 --> 01:50:31,828
I had already made the mistake,

1908
01:50:32,590 --> 01:50:34,590
of walking into Heer's life again.

1909
01:50:38,395 --> 01:50:41,528
had I known she is engaged,
I would never have gone,

1910
01:50:43,028 --> 01:50:44,548
back to her life.

1911
01:50:48,638 --> 01:50:52,373
In that one touch,

1912
01:50:55,285 --> 01:50:57,435
the vibe I got from Heer,

1913
01:50:59,417 --> 01:51:01,485
I understood that she has moved on.

1914
01:51:03,353 --> 01:51:05,087
She is no longer my Heer.

1915
01:51:06,203 --> 01:51:07,905
I am nothing but her past.

1916
01:51:09,960 --> 01:51:11,787
And she has left me far behind.

1917
01:51:12,852 --> 01:51:13,997
I was late, mom.

1918
01:51:14,840 --> 01:51:16,200
I realised this.

1919
01:51:17,465 --> 01:51:18,328
But...

1920
01:51:19,948 --> 01:51:23,778
Happy saw me there, with her.

1921
01:51:24,695 --> 01:51:25,895
Otherwise,

1922
01:51:26,918 --> 01:51:27,993
I would have turned back from there.

1923
01:51:30,460 --> 01:51:32,153
'You did not see Happy's face, mom.'

1924
01:51:32,857 --> 01:51:34,102
'He is a very good man.'

1925
01:51:34,457 --> 01:51:35,708
He felt that,

1926
01:51:36,238 --> 01:51:38,850
his world will come crashing down...

1927
01:51:39,090 --> 01:51:40,737
When he saw Heer and me together.

1928
01:51:40,827 --> 01:51:41,962
He was devastated.

1929
01:51:43,160 --> 01:51:44,887
'I had to convince him, mom,'

1930
01:51:45,483 --> 01:51:48,133
'that Heer loves him and not me.'

1931
01:51:48,857 --> 01:51:50,135
'Because during
the game of truth and dare,'

1932
01:51:50,225 --> 01:51:52,077
'Heer made a mistake
by saying that,'

1933
01:51:52,167 --> 01:51:54,220
'she regrets the fact that
I came late.'

1934
01:51:55,860 --> 01:51:57,640
'And Happy misunderstood her.'

1935
01:51:57,730 --> 01:51:59,788
'He assumed Heer still loves me.'

1936
01:52:01,450 --> 01:52:04,343
'Whereas the truth is,
Heer is empathetic towards me.'

1937
01:52:04,858 --> 01:52:06,645
'She is in love with Happy.'

1938
01:52:07,437 --> 01:52:09,907
'And it was impossible
to convince Happy,'

1939
01:52:10,710 --> 01:52:12,765
'because his self-confidence
was very low.'

1940
01:52:13,428 --> 01:52:15,250
'So, he came to me and,'

1941
01:52:16,147 --> 01:52:17,545
'said that,'

1942
01:52:17,635 --> 01:52:19,828
'he will step out of my
and Heer's way.'

1943
01:52:20,985 --> 01:52:22,533
'I would have told him
the truth there,'

1944
01:52:23,295 --> 01:52:25,083
'but he wouldn't have believed me.'

1945
01:52:25,640 --> 01:52:26,750
'he would always feel that,'

1946
01:52:26,840 --> 01:52:29,065
'I have donated Heer's love to him.'

1947
01:52:30,795 --> 01:52:32,127
'It was important that he,'

1948
01:52:33,063 --> 01:52:34,812
'should hear the truth
from the horse's mouth,'

1949
01:52:35,300 --> 01:52:37,382
'that Heer loves him, not me.'

1950
01:52:37,472 --> 01:52:38,540
But Hardy,

1951
01:52:40,013 --> 01:52:44,415
why did you have to lower yourself
in Heer's eyes for that, son?

1952
01:52:46,380 --> 01:52:47,498
There was a need, mom.

1953
01:52:49,310 --> 01:52:50,122
It was important.

1954
01:52:50,212 --> 01:52:51,500
'Because when
I went to talk to Heer,'

1955
01:52:51,590 --> 01:52:53,670
'that she made a mistake by making
the statement about regret,'

1956
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:55,865
'I heard her talking to her dad.'

1957
01:52:56,353 --> 01:52:59,593
Papa, regret doesn't mean that
I don't love Happy,

1958
01:53:00,337 --> 01:53:01,843
but I regret the fact that,

1959
01:53:02,285 --> 01:53:04,935
what fate has done
to Hardy is unfortunate.

1960
01:53:05,878 --> 01:53:07,518
And because of which
I will never stay happy.

1961
01:53:07,608 --> 01:53:09,782
I will live with this guilt forever.

1962
01:53:10,070 --> 01:53:12,255
I love Happy, papa.

1963
01:53:13,423 --> 01:53:15,130
And this guilt I feel for Hardy,

1964
01:53:15,620 --> 01:53:17,233
I will always carry it in my heart.

1965
01:53:17,560 --> 01:53:19,448
'That is when I resolved,'

1966
01:53:19,538 --> 01:53:21,592
'it is important
to make Heer despise me.'

1967
01:53:23,552 --> 01:53:25,480
Guilt, concern, regret...

1968
01:53:25,570 --> 01:53:27,193
If these things
are in a person's life, mom,

1969
01:53:27,388 --> 01:53:28,667
that person cannot stay happy.

1970
01:53:31,567 --> 01:53:33,655
And I want Heer to be happy, mom.

1971
01:53:37,243 --> 01:53:38,910
I haven't made a sacrifice, mom.

1972
01:53:39,528 --> 01:53:40,565
This is an insignificant thing.

1973
01:53:58,743 --> 01:54:00,275
Hey, this is the same guy?

1974
01:54:00,670 --> 01:54:02,305
Yes, right.

1975
01:54:04,915 --> 01:54:06,897
Oh, brother! Do you recognise me?

1976
01:54:06,987 --> 01:54:08,583
I am Harvinder Soddi.

1977
01:54:08,673 --> 01:54:10,438
The show organiser of the
'Road Star Event.'

1978
01:54:10,528 --> 01:54:13,605
You are Happy Singh,
the guy who sings on the streets?

1979
01:54:14,020 --> 01:54:15,948
Oh, brother. I came here to show
you a video.

1980
01:54:16,038 --> 01:54:18,988
When I met you the other day...
You were singing on the road.

1981
01:54:19,323 --> 01:54:21,525
I recorded
your song that day.

1982
01:54:21,615 --> 01:54:24,143
Your video has
got one million likes! - Wow!

1983
01:54:24,233 --> 01:54:25,368
Yes, sir!
- Huh!

1984
01:54:25,458 --> 01:54:28,018
If you are interested then, I would
like you to sing solo at my event?

1985
01:54:28,108 --> 01:54:29,283
Oh, great!
- Yes.

1986
01:54:29,493 --> 01:54:31,050
Brother, to begin with,

1987
01:54:31,140 --> 01:54:33,415
I won't be able to give you more
than one lakh rupees. Okay?

1988
01:54:33,505 --> 01:54:35,728
If you want, you can keep half
the amount now? - Wow!

1989
01:54:35,818 --> 01:54:37,173
Fifty thousand rupees!
- Just say yes.

1990
01:54:37,263 --> 01:54:38,920
Of course, yes!

1991
01:54:44,565 --> 01:54:45,810
My first earning!

1992
01:54:45,900 --> 01:54:47,658
I am a star! I love you!

1993
01:54:48,823 --> 01:54:52,758
I will treat all the cutie pies
sitting here to free coffee!

1994
01:54:52,848 --> 01:54:54,700
Cutie pie!

1995
01:54:56,448 --> 01:54:57,720
'The heart is crazy.'

1996
01:54:58,035 --> 01:54:59,822
'It is hard
to understand the heart.'

1997
01:55:07,625 --> 01:55:10,505
Do you know I have
great chemistry with Happy Singh.

1998
01:55:10,595 --> 01:55:12,962
"When I look into your eyes..."

1999
01:55:13,052 --> 01:55:15,653
"When you walk
with those high heels on..."

2000
01:55:15,942 --> 01:55:18,480
"My heart begins
to beat like a drum."

2001
01:55:19,818 --> 01:55:22,142
"My heart begins
to beat like a drum."

2002
01:55:22,232 --> 01:55:24,558
"My heart begins
to beat like a drum."

2003
01:55:24,648 --> 01:55:27,068
"My heart begins
to beat like a drum."

2004
01:55:27,430 --> 01:55:29,787
"When I look into your eyes..."

2005
01:55:29,877 --> 01:55:32,660
"When you walk
with those high heels on..."

2006
01:55:32,750 --> 01:55:35,077
"My heart begins
to beat like a drum."

2007
01:55:36,610 --> 01:55:38,980
"My heart begins
to beat like a drum."

2008
01:55:39,070 --> 01:55:41,390
"My heart begins
to beat like a drum."

2009
01:55:41,480 --> 01:55:43,767
"My heart begins
to beat like a drum."

2010
01:55:43,857 --> 01:55:45,307
"My heart..."

2011
01:55:52,010 --> 01:55:56,100
"My heartbeat says..."

2012
01:55:56,850 --> 01:56:01,543
"My heartbeat says that you should
live in my pulse."

2013
01:56:01,633 --> 01:56:06,343
"My heart is sentimental,
show some care."

2014
01:56:06,433 --> 01:56:10,662
"Whenever you smile,"

2015
01:56:12,610 --> 01:56:14,960
"My heart begins
to beat like a drum."

2016
01:56:15,050 --> 01:56:17,343
"My heart begins
to beat like a drum."

2017
01:56:17,433 --> 01:56:19,798
"My heart begins
to beat like a drum."

2018
01:56:20,220 --> 01:56:22,557
"When I look into your eyes..."

2019
01:56:22,647 --> 01:56:25,262
"When you walk
with those high heels on..."

2020
01:56:25,530 --> 01:56:28,047
"My heart begins
to beat like a drum."

2021
01:56:29,413 --> 01:56:31,433
"My heart begins

2022
01:56:31,828 --> 01:56:34,205
"My heart begins
to beat like a drum."

2023
01:56:34,295 --> 01:56:36,563
"My heart begins
to beat like a drum."

2024
01:56:36,653 --> 01:56:37,942
"My heart..."

2025
01:56:44,845 --> 01:56:48,868
"I am crazy about you!"

2026
01:56:49,658 --> 01:56:54,385
"I am crazy about you!"

2027
01:56:54,475 --> 01:56:59,118
"Don't check your emotions,"

2028
01:56:59,208 --> 01:57:03,428
"A look from you causes my heart
to beat in full-on attitude."

2029
01:57:05,397 --> 01:57:07,278
"My heart begins
to beat like a drum."

2030
01:57:07,820 --> 01:57:09,960
"My heart begins
to beat like a drum."

2031
01:57:10,195 --> 01:57:12,653
"My heart begins

2032
01:57:13,040 --> 01:57:15,392

2034
01:57:18,300 --> 01:57:20,860
"My heart begins

2035
01:57:22,172 --> 01:57:24,200

2036
01:57:24,623 --> 01:57:26,945
"My heart begins

2037
01:57:27,035 --> 01:57:29,383
"My heart begins

2038
01:57:29,473 --> 01:57:31,558
"My heart begins

2039
01:57:31,648 --> 01:57:33,748
"My heart begins
