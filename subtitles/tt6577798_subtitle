...and support.

30
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,590
I am in this position

31
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,670
...only because of you.

32
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,000
Because of you.

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,550
Thank you.

34
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,210
Monjunath!

35
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:02,710
Sir?

36
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,710
Kindly show me their problems.

37
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,880
Okay sir!

38
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,130
Sir, due to heavy rains, their homes have been washed out.

39
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,840
Sir!

40
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,250
Madam!

41
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,670
... until we find a solution to this problem,

42
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:21,250
You are welcome to stay with us.

43
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,000
Sir,

44
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,750
This is my personal invitation.

45
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,800
Thank you sir.

46
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,380
Come. Please come.

47
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,130
Child, come with me.

48
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,630
Greetings Sir!

49
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,590
Greetings!

50
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:04,630
My daughter is getting married next month.

51
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,880
I have no money to prepare for the wedding.

52
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,210
Please help me Sir.

53
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:17,420
Please take this Mother.

54
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,340
Monjunath…

55
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,300
Sir?

56
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:26,800
Please take this.

57
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,590
Lavanya….

58
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,130
Please take this too, mother.

59
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,340
May God bless you!

60
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:51,800
Sir,

61
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,130
Both the kidneys have failed.

62
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,000
There is only 1 donor,

63
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:00,500
And he is in Hyderabad.

64
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,300
Before the kidney reaches here,

65
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,250
It will be too late

66
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,090
How much time does he have?

67
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,880
Just about 1 hour.

68
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,460
Doctor,

69
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:17,460
Please check if my blood group matches with him?

70
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,750
It matches sir.

71
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,300
Yes Doctor!

72
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,750
Pressure is falling!

73
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,880
Scalpel?

74
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,630
Suction!

75
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,710
Heart rate stable!

76
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:37,420
Push Fluids.

77
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,300
How are his vitals doing?

78
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,380
I love you Nagu.

79
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,210
Nograj sir…

80
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,750
Nagu…

81
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,500
Sir…

82
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,880
Shame! Shame! shame!

83
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,550
OH MY GOD!
Shame! Shame! shame!

84
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:57,960
(Shame on Nograj!)
OH MY GOD!

85
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,380
Sir?
(Shame on Nograj!)

86
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,340
Lavanya….

87
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,340
Monjunath….

88
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,250
Sir..

89
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,550
What a Nightmare!

90
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:08,750
I was only giving to people. I was giving everything away for free.

91
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,590
My kidneys…

92
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,750
My kidneys?

93
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,590
(makes ‘what’ sound)

94
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,000
It’s there.

95
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,090
Lavanya,

96
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:18,670
Nagu...

97
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:19,550
Your Wedding Necklace?

98
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,710
It’s here Nagu...it’s here.

99
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:23,420
Na...Nagu…

100
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,250
Manjunath, move…

101
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,380
Sir… sir…

102
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:25,920
Shame! Shame! Shame!
Sir… sir…

103
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,960
Shame! Shame! Shame!

104
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,420
Shame on Nograj!

105
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,800
Shame! Shame! Shame!

106
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,460
Shame on Nograj!

107
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,340
Shame! Shame! Shame!

108
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,340
Take care of Nagu.

109
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:34,800
Ok, madam.

110
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,090
Shame on Nograj!

111
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,420
Nograj!

112
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,170
Down… Down...

113
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,000
Nograj!

114
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,750
Down… Down...

115
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,590
Nograj!

116
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:41,340
Down… Down...

117
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,050
Is this fine for you Sir?

118
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:45,130
Everything is gorgeous Monjunath!

119
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:45,630
Down… Down...

120
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,460
Nograj!

121
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,210
Down… Down...

122
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,050
Nograj!

123
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:48,590
Down… Down...

124
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:50,000
What are you doing? Move that side.

125
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,750
Move aside, move!

126
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,050
Hit him!

127
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:54,630
Go there! Come here,

128
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,630
Go help him!

129
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,710
Nograj Sir is coming!

130
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:58,550
Stop! Stop !

131
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,500
Stop shouting!

132
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,880
Hey, what the hell is this, show us your face!

133
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,420
Yes, don’t be a coward! Show your face!

134
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,050
Monjunath, Pramod, what the bloody hell?

135
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,670
Boss, it's not going up.

136
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,050
Raise it up, you rascal!

137
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:42,750
We are trying, Sir!

138
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,340
Greetings, my dear Friends!

139
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,090
My name is Nograj

140
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,590
I am your Humble Politician.

141
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:01,840
Hai.. Hai.. Nograj! May you feel our curse!

142
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,590
Yeah! Hi

143
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:03,500
Hi to you too!

144
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,300
Hi! Hi!

145
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,840
Go Back! Nograj… Go back!

146
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,840
What Go Back?

147
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,710
If I come, you guys have a problem,

148
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,130
if I don’t come, you guys have a problem.

149
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:12,630
Sir, our problem is that you are not doing your work properly.

150
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,670
Who said that?

151
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,340
What are they saying, Monjunath?

152
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,340
Stop, Stop, Stop!

153
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:20,090
Sir, we are from Prasad Multi-speciality hospital.

154
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:21,500
We want you to make that Road.

155
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,170
There are potholes, manholes, sewage leaks,

156
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:25,670
and garbage thrown around everywhere.

157
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,840
Monjunath,

158
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,170
I think I’ve seen him somewhere!

159
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,380
What is his name?

160
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,420
Dr. Shekhar Kumar.

161
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,920
He works at Dr. Prasad’s hospital.

162
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:32,920
Cut his electricity.

163
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,590
Ok sir.

164
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,000
If you don’t do anything about the road,

165
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,050
we will complain against you to the MLA or even to the CM’s Office.

166
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,340
Okay! Okay!

167
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,050
Calm Down! Cool Down!

168
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:41,050
Be like a cucumber! Cool!

169
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:44,800
Actually, we have re-tarred the road two years back.

170
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,130
Retard meaning,

171
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:48,170
The road has gone crazy.

172
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,340
That is not our fault

173
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,670
So this time we will not re-tar,

174
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,050
we will tar the road.

175
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,000
I hope you understand where I am coming from?

176
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,460
You people understand, right?

177
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,460
See I knows

178
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:01,960
that this road has a lot of humps, bumps, potholes and sewage,

179
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:05,460
but we will make sure that nothing will be there in 3 days.

180
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,710
Atleast, road will be there?

181
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,960
Sir, no!

182
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,420
Don’t talk nonsense,

183
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,340
Road will be there!

184
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,000
Don’t ask stupid questions.

185
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,340
My Mom,

186
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,340
My state is calling me.

187
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,550
I have to get to work now.

188
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,590
Please don’t waste my time.

189
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:19,420
Ok, please!

190
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,130
Monjunath!

191
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,670
For one road, so much protesting!

192
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,090
What the bloody hell, Monjunath?

193
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:34,750
Sir....

194
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,460
Even before reaching Dr. Prasad’s hospital

195
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,380
Lot of patients are dying in the ambulance only

196
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,550
That’s the reason for all these problems.

197
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,750
Why Monjunath?

198
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,800
We made the road 1 year back,

199
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,300
what happened?

200
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,170
No Sir,

201
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:47,460
Actually we made the road in front of your house and…

202
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,670
6 months back we retarred the same road…

203
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,050
This is last warning for you Monjunath!

204
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:51,840
Sir?

205
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,670
First, don’t bring up past nonsense…

206
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:54,750
…Secondly,

207
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,920
What is a Corporator’s salary?

208
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,050
8000 Indian Rupees, Sir.

209
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,630
So, if I have some basic comforts for myself,

210
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:02,670
what is the problem?

211
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,800
Now, kindly tell me...

212
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,460
...if we have anything against Dr. Prasad…

213
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,460
What is his problem?

214
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,000
Sir...

215
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,550
Sir, he is highly respected in the community and…

216
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:12,550
…Nanjundiah helps him politically.

217
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,750
Oh my God?

218
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,710
Nanjundiah?

219
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:15,630
Yes, sir!

220
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,960
Before I made him a Corporator,

221
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,210
He had called me and said…

222
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,880
Sir, please get me a BA degree…

223
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,460
Nanjundiah, see, keep your vision big, man…

224
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,670
Why are you doing a small fake?

225
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,090
Do a BIG fake…

226
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,670
Anyway, you are going to buy a degree,

227
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,380
so let’s buy a better degree like…

228
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,130
(thinks)

229
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:39,050
…Computer in Engineering Science!

230
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,500
Yes sir, Yes sir…

231
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,880
Come on, let’s go…

232
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,420
Sir, can you get me 2 more Degrees?

233
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,000
What a rascal you are!

234
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:51,090
Simply to keep at home…

235
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:52,380
So, he’s an Engineer Sir?

236
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,420
No Monjunath!

237
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,880
I also have an MA Degree in English.

238
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,920
Do you see me writing poetry or literature?

239
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,300
Monjunath,

240
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,210
Call Nanjundiah!

241
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:06,210
Yes Sir!

242
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:28,210
(Famous Kannada Song Music)

243
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,710
Love me or hate me…

244
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,800
Sir, Nanjundiah has come!

245
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,460
Oh! So fast he has come!

246
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,170
Kiss me or kill me…

247
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:39,090
Oh darling please do something to me…

248
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,960
What man Nanjundiah?!?

249
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,340
You are singing songs and all!

250
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:42,960
You’re killing it Man!

251
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,460
Sir!

252
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:46,920
Come with me, we have to talk!

253
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,840
Guys, enjoy, enjoy!

254
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,960
What happened sir?

255
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,130
Monjunath told me...

256
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,460
...its urgent.

257
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:51,960
Nanja!

258
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,500
Look, there is a fantastic opportunity....

259
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,250
...for all we Politicians...

260
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,500
...to make some money

261
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,880
Yeah, Sir!

262
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,840
Monjunath!

263
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,880
Breathe!

264
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,590
Manjunath! Give him the bag.

265
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,210
Breathe!

266
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,130
Not blow.

267
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:34,050
Hold it!

268
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,800
Leave it Monjunath!

269
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,670
What is wrong with you?

270
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:48,090
Finally, the great Corporator of our Ward,

271
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:49,880
Mr. Nograj finds time for us….

272
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,050
By the way, that seat is….

273
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,000
No no, you please sit there Dr. Prasad.

274
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,090
I am very comfortable here.

275
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:55,460
Come,sit!

276
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,170
So, you have started some pharmacy, storage area in your basement?

277
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:01,750
And, illegally.

278
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,090
And you haven’t taken any permission from any department as well…

279
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:06,050
I have already paid Nanjundiah. He knows that…

280
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:06,710
Oh, you have?

281
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,380
…Let me try his phone number.

282
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:08,920
Yeah?

283
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:14,750
Hello!

284
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:15,710
Hello Nanja!

285
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,300
Oh! Nograj sir!

286
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,130
Long time, no seen…

287
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,750
Yeah Nanjundiah!

288
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,960
I called because I am with Dr. Prasad

289
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,880
from the Multi-Speciality Hospital.

290
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,000
He said that he knows you.

291
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,710
Who?

292
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,500
Nanju, it is me,

293
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,460
Dr. Prasad, your friend!

294
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,130
Who?

295
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,880
Nanju, why are you doing this?

296
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,090
Monjunath! Give him the bag.

297
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:40,460
Say Cheap!

298
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,670
He is saying that you gave him the permission

299
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:48,210
to build some illegal pharmacy in the basement?

300
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,590
He came to me,

301
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,750
But I told him...

302
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,000
First, you clear it with Nograj Sir.

303
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,630
Nanju, what is happening?

304
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,170
Nanja!

305
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:55,090
Tell me sir…

306
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,420
Do me a favour.

307
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,380
What? Tell me, Sir?

308
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,000
We have that bulldozer right?

309
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,090
Yes Sir!

310
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:02,880
You kindly bring that in front of this hospital!

311
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,000
I’ll sanction it.

312
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,710
Okay Sir!

313
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:07,500
We will use the Bulldozer and…

314
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,920
…demolish his basement.

315
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,460
We’ll destroy it, okay?

316
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,380
Yeah, we will do it Sir!

317
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:14,880
Bye!

318
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,170
What do you want now?

319
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,250
Dr. Prasad,

320
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,380
for me to make the new road...

321
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,170
this is the quotation and..

322
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:24,750
you have to pay the...

323
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,050
....whole amount.

324
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,550
But, this is....

325
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:32,630
...3 times the cost sir!

326
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,840
See, just for an illegal pharmacy in the basement,

327
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,550
you’ve had to go through this extortion.

328
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,710
I know....

329
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,420
...you have 5 floors in this hospital!

330
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,710
Please,

331
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,960
Don’t make me climb all 5 floors.

332
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,250
Okay?

333
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,250
Monjunath?

334
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:47,670
Sir…

335
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,960
A apple a day keeps….

336
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,590
...AN doctor away!

337
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,880
It is not AN,

338
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:01,710
it is THIS doctor! Rascal.

339
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:07,460
He was shivering and extremely scared after seeing me.

340
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,250
Yes sir!

341
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:11,840
What was he saying?

342
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,300
(Ward Boy falls)

343
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,840
Help him!...Bring a rope!
(cries of pain)

344
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:18,590
Don’t worry brother!
(cries of pain)

345
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,380
Monjunath!

346
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:20,750
Sir..

347
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,340
This seems like a ‘pressing’ issue.

348
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,460
Lucida Grande

349
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,420
Call the Press.

350
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,170
Ok Sir!

351
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,170
Hey, move back!

352
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,960
Quiet.

353
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,630
You can trust me.

354
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,250
Sir, Sir, Sir…

355
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,210
One at a time…

356
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:41,380
Sir, Sir, Sir…

357
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,670
I said one at a time! Chill and ask…

358
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,960
Roopa babes, you can ask…

359
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,630
Sir, what are you doing inside a manhole in the middle of the day?

360
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,050
Madam, someone told me...

361
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:48,670
...that Politics is...

362
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,840
...very dirty.

363
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,550
For this country,

364
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,550
I am ready to go down and dirty!

365
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,500
I said one at a time! Chill and ask…
I am ready to go down and dirty!

366
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:54,840
I said one at a time! Chill and ask…

367
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,710
Sir, you have announced that you will make the road in 3 days?

368
00:16:58,710 --> 00:16:59,880
Yes, I said that…

369
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,500
Look,

370
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,800
Either I will be there or this manhole will be there!

371
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,000
Manhole!

372
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,130
Aye!

373
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:09,340
(echo)

374
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,050
Oh! Oh! Oh!

375
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:13,000
You are talking back to me? Arguing with me?

376
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,090
See, how much guts this gutter has…

377
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:16,550
Son of a Sewage,

378
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,710
I will close you,

379
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:18,750
you rascal!

380
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:22,500
(echo)

381
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,920
Oh! Oh! Oh!

382
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,460
Manhole, I’ll really fight you…

383
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,380
I will make sure, I close your dirty mouth!

384
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,880
Journalists!

385
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,710
Look at this manhole one last time!

386
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:32,880
In 3 days, I will close this manhole.

387
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,710
Greetings to you all!

388
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,750
What time should we start the Road Inauguration, sir?

389
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,920
Start early morning…

390
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,710
What time, sir?

391
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:08,550
12 o’clock.

392
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,960
Sir, 12 o'clock is Afternoon.

393
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,630
It will be difficult to control the traffic.

394
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:16,590
Ok, then you start...

395
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,750
...7 o’clock in the morning.

396
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:18,800
Ok...

397
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,840
Arrange for our supporters ...

398
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,250
... and give them food and hard drinks.

399
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,170
For flexes and banners,

400
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:26,590
Sir..

401
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:27,380
Put Photos!

402
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:29,670
My photo should be big.

403
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:33,000
Nanjundiah’s should be small.

404
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,420
MLA’s photo should also be big,

405
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:36,590
but not bigger than mine...

406
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:37,300
Okay?

407
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,750
You can put some smiling photo of the doctor on the side….

408
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:41,340
Okay?

409
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,170
Sir, my photo?

410
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,300
Yeah, you definitely put yours also.

411
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,630
There will be a line of scary peoples’ pictures,right?

412
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,340
You put yours in the front over there.

413
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,500
Bearer of scary face...

414
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,130
...Bloody idiot boy!

415
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:52,920
Lucida Grande

416
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,960
Other than work, is there anything else you can do

417
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,960
Always talking about work, rascal

418
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,050
Come, let's go to Azam Khan’s house for lunch.

419
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,630
Azam Khan,

420
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:09,630
this is your share.

421
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,250
Azam Khan!

422
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,750
This Biriyani is amazing!

423
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,670
Brother, eat slowly, the food is not going anywhere.

424
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:20,920
Sister,

425
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,750
Long time...

426
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,800
...since I last saw you

427
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,460
Very gorgeous to see you sister!

428
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,380
This Biryani...

429
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,000
...is really tasty,

430
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:33,210
but last time, in the Biriyani…

431
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:34,420
the ASS…

432
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:36,500
TIKKA (Ass in English)!

433
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,000
In Hindi, they say THEEKA (‘Spicy’ in English)…

434
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:39,460
TIKKA (Ass in English)!

435
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,460
He is saying SPICY, not ASS.
Serve him more biryani, I say.

436
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,550
Oh, he’s saying Spicy? Understood.

437
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,460
Here, please have brother…

438
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,250
Yeah, I meant spice…

439
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:47,170
Azam Khan what is this?

440
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:49,590
The biriyani’s taste has changed from last time,

441
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,210
What happened?

442
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:54,090
The biriyani that you had the first time,

443
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:54,710
Yeah,yeah!

444
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:57,710
was made by my first wife.

445
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:58,800
Azam Khan!…

446
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,300
Playboy!

447
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,250
Playing with second wife…

448
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,170
How is your second mummy?

449
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:09,920
Yes, tell me…

450
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,750
Sir, the seminar will have top entrepreneurs,

451
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,420
start-up success stories and…..

452
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,800
You don’t look married…

453
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,630
Is there a look for that?

454
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:22,460
Also, if you support this entrepreneurship summit,

455
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,960
we can create employment opportunities…

456
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,460
and also, your constituency will benefit from this…

457
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,300
Shut up woman!

458
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,500
Vilas, call that Nograj for a meeting!

459
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,880
MLA Sir will now meet you…

460
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,590
I have a small meeting now,

461
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,420
after that you and I can….

462
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:42,880
Sir…

463
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:44,880
Yeah!

464
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:48,590
You have put posters and banners everywhere in the ward.

465
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,050
Yes.

466
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:51,170
What is happening?

467
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,670
Sir,

468
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:53,920
Road Inauguration.

469
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,380
Why is mine smaller than yours?

470
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,130
Sir?

471
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,420
I am talking about the Photos.

472
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,500
No Sir, it is almost..

473
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,710
...the same size.

474
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,460
When is the inauguration?

475
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,420
Tomorrow.

476
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:07,840
Okay…

477
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,800
Hello….

478
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,210
Sir, Vilas told us,

479
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:13,460
you are going to Bangkok for a week long conference!

480
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,130
I will be there at the Inauguration.

481
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,420
Sir, your flight tickets are booked for tomorrow.

482
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,800
Postpone it!

483
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,550
Cut the call now,

484
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,960
I’m busy. Will call you back.

485
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,670
Nograj,

486
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:24,460
Sir..

487
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:25,800
in all the posters,

488
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,750
my photo...

489
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,460
...should be the biggest.

490
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,250
Monjunath! Dance!

491
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,000
Greetings, my dear friends!

492
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,670
My name is Nograj

493
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,050
I am your humble politician!

494
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,920
I will keep my speech really short.

495
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,420
In classical Athens,

496
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:30,590
the respected Socrates said,

497
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,840
I know I am intelligent,

498
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,500
because I know that...

499
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,250
...I know nothing.

500
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:41,300
(explains, in Kannada)

501
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:46,000
All of us have to come together,

502
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,710
as an apartment, society, district, state, Karnataka…

503
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:53,380
…Because we have to make RCB win this year!

504
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,090
That day, I went to the fridge,

505
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:58,250
I opened it.

506
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,630
Light came on.

507
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:00,590
I closed the door.

508
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:01,750
Light went off!

509
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,880
How is that happening I wonder?

510
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:09,090
What happened in the year 1984?

511
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,250
I was born.

512
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:14,210
When I was born, I was 18kgs.

513
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,250
Every city needs Ninja Turtles!

514
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:20,630
The Ninja Turtles….

515
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:22,090
Sir, sir, its been 4 hours.

516
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:23,710
The Press is waiting.

517
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:24,550
Please come to the point, Sir…

518
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:25,710
Okay, go stand there…

519
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,420
So hereby dear friends,

520
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,590
I announce the road Op...

521
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,960
Oh my God! MLA JFK sir!

522
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,960
Please come sir…

523
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:40,000
Just how these Corporators are my servants,

524
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,710
as the MLA of this constituency…

525
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:46,090
I am your servant.

526
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:48,590
Wake up!

527
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,340
I saw the condition of the road

528
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,880
and was terribly hurt.

529
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,880
So,

530
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,800
I called Nograj immediately.

531
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,250
I only told him to make this road

532
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,590
Who called him?

533
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,500
I called him!

534
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,300
It makes me really happy

535
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:11,170
that based on my orders this work was done and in such short time.

536
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,130
Victory to India!

537
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:17,210
Victory to Karnataka!

538
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:02,630
Azam Khan, come on, let’s dance...

539
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:04,170
I can’t move anything, forget about it man.

540
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,300
Nograj Sir?

541
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:09,420
Sir,

542
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,380
why are you upset?

543
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,460
Sir,

544
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,880
MLA has done this to everyone. Not just you.

545
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,500
Poor Chikke Gowda, in a Sports Day function

546
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,420
he ran carrying the torch…

547
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,710
Right before his flame could light the cauldron...

548
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:24,300
MLA JFK used his torch to light the cauldron.

549
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:28,000
MLA JFK took the credit that was meant for Chikke Gowda.

550
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,090
MLA has done more.

551
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,800
Channa Gowda

552
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,550
had organised a green drive to plant trees...

553
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:38,880
Poor man, he stood in the hot sun

554
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,050
And dug for hours...

555
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:43,630
... to plant 10 saplings

556
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:45,460
As he was about the put the plants..

557
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,380
MLA JFK suddenly came there

558
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:52,710
and put his plants in all the holes.

559
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:58,550
After making the road myself

560
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,340
this rascal MLA

561
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,670
has made me 'anonymouse'.

562
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:06,000
The solution for this is very simple!

563
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,880
We have to join hands together

564
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,050
and fight against him!

565
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,920
Who will fight against him Sir?

566
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,550
Nanja, I am there right?

567
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,000
Among us, who has made the most amount of money?

568
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:20,380
Say my name!

569
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:23,210
Among us, who is the most corrupt

570
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:24,550
to stand against MLA JFK?

571
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,210
Monjunath…

572
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:28,710
Sir…

573
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:31,550
All these fellows are bloody politicians...

574
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:34,130
They wouldn’t think twice before crossing me…

575
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:35,630
Show them the photos.

576
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,250
I am not like them.

577
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,300
I am a very

578
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,630
humble,

579
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:42,960
honest politician!

580
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,710
Sir, we will support you!....

581
00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:59,130
What?

582
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:00,670
Why will we not support you?

583
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:02,380
We will support you!

584
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,170
Wow!

585
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,250
Monjunath!

586
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:29,630
Sir..

587
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:31,960
They just picked up the garbage,

588
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,880
what to find out where they dump it.

589
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,710
Yes sir..

590
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:37,380
Come let’s find out! Come!

591
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,750
Let’s follow his behind.

592
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:46,800
Monjunath,

593
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:47,460
Sir..

594
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,210
Investigation is an art.

595
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,250
Sir..

596
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,170
You look like Sherlock Whole-mess.

597
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,300
Monjunath,

598
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,630
it is not a Sherlock Whole-mess,

599
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,710
it is a Sherlock Homeless.

600
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:00,090
Please!

601
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,250
Greetings!

602
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:14,550
Myself, Mr. Nograj,

603
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:15,750
I’m the Corporator of D.S. Nagar

604
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,340
Greetings, sir!

605
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:20,250
If you are dumping the garbage in the city itself,

606
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,460
why are you picking it up?

607
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:23,670
Sir, what else do we do?

608
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,210
We do this everyday,

609
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:26,800
because there is no place in the city to dump the garbage.

610
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,090
We pick it up from one area and drop it in another area.

611
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:30,460
Oh my God,

612
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,340
that's a lot of hardwork.

613
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,590
Monjunath, hug him…

614
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,590
Sir…Me?

615
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,170
Okay, stop, stop!

616
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:43,960
Okay..

617
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:47,500
Monjunath,

618
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:51,840
Bribe the Additional Commissioner.

619
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,130
Ask him to send these truck drivers

620
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:55,340
...garbage collectors...

621
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,090
...on a strike!

622
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:58,590
If someone asks him why,

623
00:28:58,590 --> 00:28:59,590
let him say…

624
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:01,670
The Contractors haven’t made the payment to the garbage collectors.

625
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:02,460
Okay sir..

626
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,300
Come on, let’s go.

627
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:30,090
Mario! Come on!

628
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:31,420
You are Super Mario, right?

629
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,210
Jump on the turtle!

630
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:36,880
Take all the coins!

631
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,000
Take it!

632
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:54,460
(Protestors) This government is growing on us like garbage!

633
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,880
WE can't even keep our own back yard clean!

634
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,250
Sir, they...

635
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,250
THEY…

636
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:02,800
THEY…they can't even keep their own backyard clean!

637
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:07,800
How will MLA JFK keep our constituency clean?

638
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:08,960
We strongly condemn this!

639
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,460
What is MLA JFK doing?

640
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,000
Call him for a meeting.

641
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,170
I’ve just reached the party office.

642
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,420
Will talk to you later.

643
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,840
Sir, what I’m trying to say is…

644
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,550
I understand JFK,

645
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:34,000
but the President is very upset.

646
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,880
MLA elections are not too far away.

647
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,550
If you want the party ticket again...

648
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:41,420
at least project some good performance.

649
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,550
You don’t worry sir,

650
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:43,800
I'll take care of everything.

651
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:50,460
Vilas!

652
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,420
Sir, our Party Secretary

653
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,340
has a big problem with MLA JFK.

654
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:02,960
What’s the reason Monjunath?

655
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:06,710
Sir, before they started hardcore politics,

656
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,500
The secretary...

657
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,340
And MLA..

658
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:11,960
...had feeling for each other.

659
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,000
What do you mean by feelings?

660
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:14,920
They liked…

661
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,500
loved each other, sir.

662
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,170
My God!

663
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:18,550
Like a man to man?

664
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:19,670
A politician to politician?

665
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:21,590
See Monjunath!

666
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:23,840
The position of a Secretary is usually held by ladies.

667
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,710
If a man works as a Secretary,

668
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:28,500
there is definitely a problem.

669
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,380
Huh?

670
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,380
Come on! Not you Monjunath.

671
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:38,590
Can we do doggy style madam?

672
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:39,500
You mean the Downward Dog?

673
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,880
Yeah, that’s what I said.

674
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,590
Please arrange a meeting with that secretary Monjunath.

675
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,630
Okay sir.

676
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:05,460
Who are they?

677
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,090
I’ve got these two gay people

678
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,380
to make you feel comfortable!

679
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:14,300
Nograj,

680
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:16,920
I am comfortable with you.

681
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:20,750
You two,

682
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:21,960
Get lost!

683
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,460
Get out!

684
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:28,460
Yeah!

685
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:29,920
Nograj,

686
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:32,210
what can I do for you?

687
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:32,960
See,

688
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I know your entire history

689
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,340
with MLA JFK.

690
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,130
That was years ago, but Nograj,

691
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:50,800
time changes everything, right?

692
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,250
No Madam.

693
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,550
I mean...

694
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:54,000
...Sir.

695
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:59,710
You guys have shared some romantic moments

696
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:03,460
but this MLA has not come out in the open about your relationship.

697
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,340
He has cheated on you.

698
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:07,500
I couldn’t gain his love at the time.

699
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:09,210
but ...

700
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:10,750
...now I can't do anything.

701
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,550
Yes you can!

702
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,000
The garbage scam and these dirty toilets....

703
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,800
Who do you think is behind it?

704
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:17,250
JFK and his people.

705
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,420
Gurudas,

706
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,090
Think straight!

707
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,590
But I can't!

708
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:23,340
Focus Gurudas.

709
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,550
Until when are you going to bend in front of MLA JFK?

710
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:27,590
What else do I do?

711
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:30,000
My position as a Secretary forces me to bend before him.

712
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:33,710
Gurudas, don’t force me to use bad language!

713
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,710
Okay. okay..

714
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:37,590
What do you want from me?

715
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,670
Sir, I want the MLA Election Ticket.

716
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:44,710
What will I get in return?

717
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:46,000
Money…

718
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,840
I can give you that,

719
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,840
because as a politician, that is what I do best.

720
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,090
Okay,

721
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,550
I will support you!

722
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,500
Come!

723
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,170
Gurudas!

724
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:03,090
Don’t go back on your word okay!

725
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:07,800
Look, I don’t have a problem with people like you…

726
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,050
…but, I can always make the public...

727
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:12,550
... have a problem with people like you.

728
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:15,420
Okay?

729
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,670
Nagu,

730
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:25,630
Look who’s here?

731
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:27,250
You know Sumathi, our relative, right?

732
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,210
Meet her brother, Chandu.

733
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:31,920
What man!

734
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:33,800
What have you become?

735
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:34,840
Nagu,

736
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,090
Chandu wants to become an actor.

737
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:44,090
Will you please introduce him to your Producer friend?

738
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,800
See Chandu, you will become an actor.

739
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,750
I can put you in a movie as well,

740
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,590
but the question is...

741
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:51,710
who will watch your movie?

742
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:53,920
Then again, she will come back to me and say:

743
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,420
Please Nagu

744
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:57,250
let's go for Chandu’s movie.

745
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:58,420
I will only have to watch it right?

746
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,210
Nagu!

747
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:02,960
Okay Chandu,

748
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,880
what kind of films do you want to act in?

749
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:05,920
Like horror films

750
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,250
or extremely horror films?

751
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,550
No man, please save me from yourself!

752
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,590
I can't watch horror films.

753
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,500
Nagu, I’ve already promised our relatives.

754
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,590
Monjunath,

755
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:18,050
Sir..

756
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:21,000
please call Cycle Babu! He is making a new film.

757
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Tell him to put this fellow in his film.

758
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,000
Thank you Nagu.

759
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,050
A Politician lives...

760
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:30,130
...a horrific life, Monjunath.

761
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,550
Everybody is taking advantage of us.

762
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:35,590
It is very scary.

763
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:41,130
Lavanya,

764
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:42,590
Where is the water?

765
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:45,210
What is this? The water is never there!

766
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:47,460
Water tanker has just arrived Nagu.

767
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,170
Tell them to leave the water tankers here.

768
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:54,000
Once they have emptied the water in our borewell…
Ask them to refill the tankers.

769
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,460
Actor it seems. Who are better actors than us politicians?!?

770
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,550
Chandu, are you happy?

771
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:00,920
Aye Lavanya! I will not come home for Dinner.

772
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:07,090
What do you think you are doing?

773
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,710
Huh?

774
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,550
You are all useless.

775
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,960
Look at your faces!

776
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:18,800
You look like toilets.

777
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,920
What, you can’t just say that we are latrines!

778
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,630
Azam Khan, just shut up!

779
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,380
What do you think my work is?

780
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:31,420
Going for study tours to different countries,

781
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:35,050
and seeing how they function…

782
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,250
Whatever work you are doing in the city does not matter…

783
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:40,300
Yes sir.. yes sir..

784
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,800
Because in the public eye,

785
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:45,090
I am the real representative.

786
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:46,920
The elected representative.

787
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:53,340
You all are just Jokers.

788
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,050
This is the last warning.

789
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:57,380
If any of you become the reason...

790
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,750
...for my name to get mixed up in any scam,

791
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:00,840
it will be very bad for you.

792
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,630
No Sir, that wont happen, we will make sure.
Promise!

793
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,590
I have some more time.

794
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:07,880
If there are any important issues, let's discuss them!

795
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,250
Sir.. sir.. sir..

796
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:13,880
Sir, can you please get me a membership in the Bangalore City Club?

797
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,840
Will get it done, don’t worry.

798
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,550
Next?

799
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:19,420
Sir, there is a major water shortage problem in the ward…

800
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,380
Look Krishna,

801
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:25,250
if there is a real issue, tell me, we can discuss that.

802
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,590
Yes, Nograj…

803
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:29,840
Sir, Pratap Reddy’s daughter is getting married…

804
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,880
So?

805
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:35,130
All us Corporators are doing a dance performance.

806
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:37,340
If you could join us, and shake a leg or two,

807
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,670
it will be amazing.

808
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:40,750
Vilas,

809
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:41,210
Sir..

810
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:43,960
Monday afternoon, block my time for dance rehearsals.

811
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,210
Yay! That is amazing!

812
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:46,210
Love you sir!

813
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:49,750
Sir, there is a stray cattle problem in a few wards…

814
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:51,210
So, what the hell should I do?

815
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:52,210
Lucida Grande

816
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:54,250
You only can find the solution for that…

817
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:58,090
or just take the cattle to your house and let them graze there.

818
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:02,710
I have arranged

819
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:04,880
a party for all of you

820
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,300
Lucida Grande

821
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,380
10 o’clock.

822
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,420
You are all invited.

823
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,880
I’m happy to throw free food and drinks at you, for you.

824
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:12,170
Sir sir, please come…

825
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,920
Looks like you’ve arranged a big party?

826
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:17,800
Nothing much, Sir.

827
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,210
You had asked me keep the Corporators in check…

828
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:23,170
So decided to treat them with good food and few drinks.

829
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:25,960
Sir, what will you have? Please come sir…

830
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,380
Hey, no, no!

831
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:29,300
What do you have to drink though?

832
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,170
Come Sir! Let’s go.

833
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:34,050
People can sleep at their workplace…

834
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:37,420
But when us politicians sleep in the parliament, they have a problem.

835
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:40,000
People don’t Vote,

836
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,630
but when we win the elections, they have a problem!

837
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:46,420
That's what is happening in this country.

838
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:49,750
What can anyone do? What's in our hands,tell me?

839
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:52,090
I'm tired of this.

840
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:54,750
Lucida Grande

841
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,880
What sexy Music!? Come here!

842
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,590
US India, wherever you go,

843
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:06,380
politics is a problem.

844
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,210
Whatever a minister does,

845
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:16,210
the common man has a problem

846
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,630
You sit on facebook...

847
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:25,050
...and write comments.

848
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:27,420
Ok its our fault we know that,

849
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:30,590
but now let's talk about you…

850
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:32,550
We have to definitely talk about them!

851
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,920
Hey listen!

852
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,670
You all do whatever you please,

853
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:39,920
but if we do it, it’s a problem.

854
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,340
If YOU do something, it’s awesome.

855
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:49,800
If WE do something, it’s a problem.

856
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,210
Shake those rice cakes i say!

857
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:05,840
As a joke,

858
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:09,050
you say whatever you feel like…

859
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:13,630
Just like how we say whatever we feel like for a vote.

860
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,550
For God,

861
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:18,090
you keep a kilogram of flowers...

862
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:23,300
You are our God; hence we keep flowers on your ears.

863
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,710
I'm one among you,

864
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:28,420
and not just a servant

865
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:30,670
By saying whatever you feel...

866
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:33,840
You have hurt my feelings...

867
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,840
I am hurt too much.

868
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:40,550
You give us bribes,

869
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:43,300
but if we take them, you have a problem!

870
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:44,710
Ya, correct!

871
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:53,050
You make MMS, but if we watch them, you have a problem!

872
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:54,130
Give me your Whatsapp number...

873
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:54,840
...I’ll forward it to you also.

874
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,920
You lie to your wife...

875
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,500
...and have a problem with our promises to you.

876
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:09,460
You mass bunk at college…

877
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:12,000
But you have a problem with our attendance in the Parliament.

878
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,170
Azam, go to the Parliament I say.

879
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,340
You all do whatever you please,

880
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:21,800
but if we do it, it’s a problem.

881
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,630
Shake it Baby!

882
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:29,090
If YOU do something, it’s awesome.

883
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:31,500
If WE do something, it’s a problem.

884
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:38,210
Ok, so what's the final word on this?

885
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:42,550
You and I, we are both the same…

886
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:48,710
And that is why we have this problem.

887
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,460
Aye Gurudas, what are you doing?

888
00:41:58,090 --> 00:41:59,750
Arun, I was thinking...

889
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:02,000
Nivvi has summer holidays.

890
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,800
Can’t we go to the US soon?

891
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,380
Nivvi will like it.

892
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:06,710
We went in December,

893
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,300
isn’t it too early to visit again?

894
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:09,920
I miss our lifestyle Arun!

895
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:12,130
I’m not able to find our footing here.

896
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:14,340
Wouldn’t it be better for Nivvi to study in US?

897
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:15,420
We studied here, didn’t we?

898
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:16,920
That’s not the point.

899
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:19,380
Our company is also doing well here.

900
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:20,710
If you want, you can be in the US and ...

901
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:23,420
...come down here a few times and take care of work.

902
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,340
Thanks.

903
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:25,590
Rama I am a bit confused!

904
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:27,210
I thought you were okay with all of this.

905
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:28,670
We discussed about Nivvi too!

906
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:29,880
I know,

907
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,340
I am!

908
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:32,050
But your Mother also would love it,

909
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,590
if she can see her granddaughter often.

910
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:35,670
We have to think about that as well.

911
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:36,880
That’s what I…

912
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,050
Here…

913
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,800
April, I’ll be tied up with the Company Audit.

914
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:42,880
I won’t be able to come…

915
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,630
but I’ll arrange for Nivvi and you to go.

916
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,500
I have no other option.

917
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,460
(Car honking)

918
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:00,170
I don’t want to compromise but…

919
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:02,800
I'll just call you back.

920
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:05,960
Has he lost his mind?

921
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,050
Why is he honking so much?

922
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:13,550
(Car honking)

923
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:14,670
Excuse me,

924
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:15,920
roll down your window!

925
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:16,960
You cant see?

926
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:17,710
Are you blind?

927
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:19,840
The signal is red! Where do I go?

928
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:21,550
You are honking continuously!

929
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:22,630
Don’t you have brains?

930
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,420
Where the hell do you want me to go man?

931
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:24,880
Sir…

932
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,590
You look like an educated guy. What are you doing?

933
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:27,880
No, no….Roll down the window,

934
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:28,750
Let’s talk!

935
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:30,050
Roll down the window! Hey!

936
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:37,750
Sir,

937
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:40,750
Sir, traffic’s piled up, let’s go…

938
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:45,130
People are just not going to change here.

939
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,880
Sir, need to talk to you about something…

940
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,340
About Nograj…

941
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:52,880
I haven’t heard much about him.

942
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,710
That is his speciality sir.

943
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:57,880
His scams never get exposed.

944
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:01,300
Compared to all the other Corporators…

945
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:04,050
He has made the most amount of money for the Party.

946
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:07,340
Does he give us our share on time?

947
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:09,300
Yes, he is very punctual, sir!

948
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:12,090
Why are you recommending him so much?

949
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:14,380
Is there anything happening between him and you?

950
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:16,380
I’m not recommending sir,

951
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:18,380
just letting you know is all.

952
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:19,500
Anyway,

953
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:23,420
it's the President right who always takes decisions…

954
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:26,880
But, if you put in a word,

955
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,170
it’ll be better Sir…

956
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:30,920
Okay, fine.

957
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:44,670
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

958
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,380
My God!

959
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:52,880
Love you!

960
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:02,880
What an amazing dancer you are my lady!

961
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:04,210
Very nice!

962
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:06,750
That gift is very good from Thailand!

963
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:07,840
Very nice, right?

964
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:08,880
Yeah, very nice!

965
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,750
Actually, I have to go again on a business trip to

966
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:12,800
Thailand!

967
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:17,000
Hey, your diary!

968
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,300
Yeah yeah! Yeah yeah!

969
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:21,710
Actually whenever I need political inspiration,

970
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:22,750
I look at this diary.

971
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:24,210
My first scam!

972
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:31,670
Nograj!

973
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:32,960
Sit properly, I say!

974
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,420
This is not your father’s home.

975
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,210
What can we do for our college’s 10th anniversary function?

976
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:43,050
Sir!

977
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:44,340
Nograj?

978
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:47,750
How about we call like a...

979
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:48,630
... singer?

980
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,460
Kumar Sanu...

981
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:53,840
...or S.P. Balasubrabanian?

982
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,460
College said yes and sanctioned the money for the event.

983
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:01,500
Everybody was very excited.

984
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,340
Why because, S.P. Balasubrabanian will come and…

985
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:06,250
Nagu, its S.P. Balasubramaniam…

986
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:07,420
Yeah yeah,

987
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:09,130
he will come, and sing…

988
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:12,920
♪ For joy, sing for joy ♪

989
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:15,090
What is that other song? That…

990
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:20,630
♪ Hundreds of memories from my soul ♪

991
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:21,420
What a song!

992
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,130
That other one. The Hindi song…

993
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:32,090
♪ Who am I to you ♪

994
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:33,460
Everybody came for the event.

995
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:36,500
Except S.P. Balasubrabanian.

996
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,050
Honestly,

997
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:40,550
I didn't even book him for the event.

998
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,170
Then what happened?

999
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:43,630
The students...

1000
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:44,960
... went crazy.

1001
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:47,380
They had bought the tickets...

1002
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:48,960
...and wanted entertainment!

1003
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,710
What I did was,

1004
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:53,840
I shared the money along with my Professor…

1005
00:46:54,170 --> 00:46:58,880
And told the students that S.P. Balasubrabanian did not come…

1006
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,750
…because the management did not pay him.

1007
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:05,090
I created a fight between the college and the students.

1008
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:10,130
Do you remember

1009
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,500
the first time you saw me?

1010
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,550
Not even 1 question came from your leaked question paper.

1011
00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:18,670
I am not going to leave you!

1012
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:20,050
Padmanabh,

1013
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:21,300
we leaked 3 question papers.

1014
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:23,000
Which one is he talking about?

1015
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,670
I will complain to the Principal and get you suspended.

1016
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:27,170
(mimicking) Is this your father’s college?

1017
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:28,550
Not his father’s college.

1018
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:30,840
Its her father’s college!

1019
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:31,630
Lavanya!

1020
00:47:49,550 --> 00:47:51,000
I remember…

1021
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,050
In our first meeting itself, we banged each other nicely!

1022
00:47:57,250 --> 00:48:01,630
Your Books and your Money was falling out of your purse…

1023
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:15,750
…But I was falling for…

1024
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:23,750
…You…

1025
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:26,550
I love you Nagu.

1026
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:28,670
Okay.

1027
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:33,250
Monjunath,

1028
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:35,420
What are we doing in the office?

1029
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:38,000
Sir, to end MLA JFK’s career...

1030
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:38,800
... we have to do one more scam.

1031
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,380
We have to screw in him.

1032
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:42,130
Monjunath,

1033
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:43,590
it is not a screw in him,

1034
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:44,920
It is a screw on him.

1035
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:46,000
Yes, that’s what I meant Sir.

1036
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:00,170
Monjunath,

1037
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:00,420
Sir..

1038
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:01,500
Call Inspector Bette Gowda.

1039
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:02,340
Where sir?

1040
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:05,590
The place where us Politicians belong.

1041
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,090
Okay Sir.

1042
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:16,170
Bette gowda!

1043
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,210
I need you to do a small thing for me.

1044
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:19,840
Tell me Sir…

1045
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:23,550
Nothing much man, we have to just do a small scam, that’s all…

1046
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:24,550
Okay...

1047
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:33,670
You will get your share!

1048
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:35,050
Okay, done.

1049
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:45,960
No-parking!

1050
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:50,300
Hello Madam!

1051
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:51,300
Can’t you see the board?

1052
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:52,670
When I came, the board was not here!

1053
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:53,670
It is here!

1054
00:49:54,130 --> 00:49:56,590
Give me the fine!

1055
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:58,590
Give me your mobile number.

1056
00:49:58,590 --> 00:49:59,800
Why should I give you my number?

1057
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:01,960
When I left my vehicle there wasn’t a No Parking Signboard…

1058
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:02,960
And now you are asking me for money?

1059
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,300
I’ll have to Whatsapp the bill to you buddy.

1060
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:04,840
Its Digital India.

1061
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,960
If I’m not paying you anything, why will I give you my number?

1062
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,550
And, you don’t even look like a Policeman!

1063
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:10,300
And you? You look like a citizen or what?

1064
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:12,750
Just give me your mobile number. Starts with 9 right?

1065
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:13,550
Yes, 9…

1066
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:14,500
After that I won’t tell you…

1067
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:18,380
Seize the vehicle,

1068
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:19,210
and while towing, damage it as well…

1069
00:50:19,210 --> 00:50:19,960
Sir!

1070
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,460
Hello! My bike!

1071
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:50,380
Oh, the boys have already kept the no parking board here,

1072
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:50,880
super!

1073
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,380
Look at this dude, what a car.

1074
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:53,880
Audi!

1075
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,710
Listen, you guys carry on, I’ll meet you later!

1076
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:04,210
Greetings!

1077
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:16,460
Sir, I had parked the car on the right side.

1078
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:18,000
Its 10th today.

1079
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:18,880
An even number, right?

1080
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,050
I had checked the board before parking.

1081
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:22,170
When I returned, my car wasn’t there

1082
00:51:22,170 --> 00:51:24,130
and the board was changed to odd numbers.

1083
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:25,090
How is it possible?

1084
00:51:25,090 --> 00:51:27,210
Go, complain to the Traffic Police.

1085
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:28,090
Why have you come here?

1086
00:51:28,090 --> 00:51:29,710
Sir, I went there.

1087
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:31,090
They say, they haven’t towed the car.

1088
00:51:31,090 --> 00:51:32,670
They directed me to come here.

1089
00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:33,800
What car do you have?

1090
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:34,800
White colour, Audi,

1091
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,710
plate number KA0…

1092
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:38,170
Oh! Audi is it?

1093
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:41,170
Sir, actually, the same thing happened to me.

1094
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:43,250
When I parked, the board showed even numbers.

1095
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:44,550
I checked right after parking.

1096
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:45,800
When I returned, my bike was being towed and…

1097
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,590
When I saw the board, it was was changed to odd numbers.

1098
00:51:47,590 --> 00:51:50,250
Your fault, your confusion,

1099
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:51,670
And then you say odd-even, even-odd…

1100
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:53,590
No... We've both been cheated, and we are confused?

1101
00:51:53,590 --> 00:51:54,460
This is bloody irritating.

1102
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:57,210
What? Who?

1103
00:51:57,210 --> 00:51:59,630
Who are you calling bloody?

1104
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:01,340
Look, file your complaint!

1105
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:02,420
I'll look into into it.

1106
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:04,380
Calling us bloody wont work!

1107
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:11,250
(Humming song : Shape of You)

1108
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:14,130
Sir, what is your opinion about the No Parking Scam happening in the city?

1109
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:16,670
People are paying scamsters and getting cheated off their money…

1110
00:52:17,590 --> 00:52:19,090
Madam, I don’t know anything.

1111
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:22,840
It is a very mysterious conspiracy.

1112
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:25,250
Look, I am not the MLA.

1113
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:29,590
Are you saying that MLA JFK is behind all of this?

1114
00:52:29,590 --> 00:52:31,670
Don’t throw allegations at me, Madam.

1115
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:35,340
Don’t speak like this about MLA JFK.

1116
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:36,590
So according to you,

1117
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:39,000
who is behind this No Parking money-making scam?

1118
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:39,880
MLA.

1119
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:42,920
I love him.

1120
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:45,960
According to me, terrorists are behind this Scam.

1121
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:47,420
Pakistan is the reason.

1122
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:48,000
Okay.

1123
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,130
No more questions.

1124
00:52:49,130 --> 00:52:50,380
Order some Snacks for her.

1125
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:51,500
Okay sir..

1126
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:57,880
Deva, now!

1127
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:01,380
Get one more sign.

1128
00:53:02,590 --> 00:53:04,250
Putting no parking sign boards in an Office Parking?

1129
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:06,960
Sir, MLA Jagathprabhu F Kumar told us to do this…

1130
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,170
What do you mean MLA Jagathprabhu told you to?

1131
00:53:08,170 --> 00:53:08,960
Sir, leave me sir…

1132
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:09,590
Who?

1133
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,170
Catch him!

1134
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,590
Investigation is happening.

1135
00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:17,800
Our investigation will be out soon and…

1136
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,460
We'll make sure that our investigation...

1137
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:22,300
....will go deeper...

1138
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:23,630
...to find the people ...

1139
00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:26,090
...responsible for this investigation.

1140
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:29,130
MLA Jagathprabhu F Kumar is using the youth of our state

1141
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:31,750
and making them do unlawful things.

1142
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:33,300
What we need is better governance.

1143
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:35,840
We need good leaders, not just politicians.

1144
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,090
Kiran, please send in some water.

1145
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:39,250
and solve the problems that are ruining our city.

1146
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:40,210
Ridiculous!

1147
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:41,750
Did you get your car back?

1148
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:42,590
Yeah!

1149
00:53:43,090 --> 00:53:44,090
Any damages?

1150
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:45,840
Have to replace the locking system.

1151
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,670
Is this why we voted for him?

1152
00:53:49,670 --> 00:53:51,090
MLA JFK has to resign.

1153
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:10,130
What a beauty night this is!

1154
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:11,130
Monjunath!

1155
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:13,800
Put the money in different bags...

1156
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,090
...and keep it ready.

1157
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:18,090
I’ll tell you how much each Corporator has to get.

1158
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:18,840
Okay?

1159
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:22,210
It was an honour to work on you Sir.

1160
00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:23,340
Monjunath!

1161
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:25,750
It is not honour to work on me..

1162
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:28,000
It is an honour to work in me.

1163
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:30,000
Okay?

1164
00:54:30,090 --> 00:54:31,960
MLA JFK!...Resign Now!

1165
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:33,500
MLA JFK!...Step down!

1166
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,300
MLA JFK!...Leave the Party!

1167
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:36,960
President Sir,

1168
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,420
please give me 1 more chance.

1169
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:40,670
I’ll make everything okay.

1170
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:42,170
I don’t know anything about the Scams Sir.

1171
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:45,710
Please give me some time to fix this.

1172
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:48,000
Jagathprabhu F Kumar…

1173
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,920
Get out!

1174
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:55,090
One more thing.

1175
00:54:55,670 --> 00:54:57,920
If you try anything crazy or silly,

1176
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,880
it won't be good for you.

1177
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:08,420
Sir! Sir!

1178
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:14,250
What a beauty night this is!

1179
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:16,550
That MLA rascal,

1180
00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:18,340
he called me a servant…

1181
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:22,340
Clap, Clap Yeah, very nice.

1182
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:24,630
Very nice.

1183
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:40,590
Madam,

1184
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:42,920
We will have to call the water tanker again!

1185
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,630
Okay…

1186
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:50,590
Madam,

1187
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:53,420
May I borrow 2-3 buckets of water?

1188
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:55,300
Sure.

1189
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:57,340
You can deduct from my salary.

1190
00:55:58,500 --> 00:55:59,340
Shanta,

1191
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:00,960
What are you saying?

1192
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,090
Please take the water.

1193
00:56:02,090 --> 00:56:04,550
In fact, I’ll send the driver with you.

1194
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:06,130
ok

1195
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:12,880
I don’t know how people manage.

1196
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:16,630
Nivvi,

1197
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:17,800
Don’t waste Water.

1198
00:56:19,090 --> 00:56:20,170
We have to save Water.

1199
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:30,090
Yeah, yeah, slightly lower.

1200
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:32,420
Raju, please press properly.

1201
00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:35,550
Yeah, there.

1202
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:39,250
Do you know why I come here?

1203
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:40,800
No, Sir.

1204
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:41,710
Raju…

1205
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:48,340
There…

1206
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,050
Sir,

1207
00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:53,670
Now that MLA JFK is ousted.

1208
00:56:53,670 --> 00:56:57,210
When will I get the party ticket for elections?

1209
00:56:57,210 --> 00:57:00,090
Just by him being thrown out isn’t enough.

1210
00:57:00,090 --> 00:57:02,550
You have to get higher than where he was.

1211
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,960
For the President to notice you,

1212
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,420
You have to rise…

1213
00:57:20,630 --> 00:57:21,380
What do you mean by rise?

1214
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:25,960
Rise meaning,

1215
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:27,630
you have to do good work.

1216
00:57:28,550 --> 00:57:31,130
Public has to notice your work.

1217
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:36,170
Go to schools, colleges, communities.

1218
00:57:36,170 --> 00:57:37,500
Okay, I will do all of this.

1219
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:41,130
I will make sure that the public notices my work.

1220
00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:43,550
Then,

1221
00:57:43,550 --> 00:57:44,840
how are things?

1222
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:46,380
What do you mean by things?

1223
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:49,340
Gurudas! I am a Nograju,

1224
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:50,670
not a Raju!

1225
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:52,170
Monjunath, are you coming with me or staying here?

1226
00:57:52,170 --> 00:57:53,000
Coming with you Sir.

1227
00:57:54,130 --> 00:57:57,840
Ok, softly. Yeah go higher, yeah higher…

1228
00:58:01,550 --> 00:58:05,750
Dear friends,

1229
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:09,090
What’s up?

1230
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:11,800
Students!

1231
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,630
In life...

1232
00:58:13,630 --> 00:58:15,500
...There is always...

1233
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:18,000
...give and take.

1234
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,750
Give means to share something,

1235
00:58:21,630 --> 00:58:24,250
and take means to extract something.

1236
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:25,880
Let me give you a small example.

1237
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:27,050
Now,

1238
00:58:27,050 --> 00:58:27,800
Imagine...

1239
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:30,210
...both of you get married!

1240
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:33,000
You’ll be at your Honeymoon!

1241
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,630
There, your wife will give you...

1242
00:58:35,630 --> 00:58:37,050
... a hot glass of milk.

1243
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:39,000
She will also take something.

1244
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,340
What will she take?

1245
00:58:42,130 --> 00:58:43,960
Your love!

1246
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:45,340
She will take that one.

1247
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,960
You all know the answer.

1248
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:52,170
‘Taking’ is the answer.

1249
00:58:52,170 --> 00:58:54,550
Okay, I’ll give you one more example.

1250
00:58:54,550 --> 00:58:56,710
Sir, please stop, they understood.

1251
00:58:56,710 --> 00:58:57,460
Okay, okay.

1252
00:58:57,460 --> 00:58:59,500
So everyone is taking...

1253
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:01,500
...but when we politicians are taking...

1254
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:03,000
...why people are complaining?

1255
00:59:03,550 --> 00:59:05,960
Please don’t discriminate like this,

1256
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:07,000
its not right.

1257
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:11,420
So with this message, to start this celebration…

1258
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:14,210
Our celebration is going to be incomplete,

1259
00:59:14,210 --> 00:59:16,090
so please welcome our chief guest…

1260
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:16,920
It’s me right?

1261
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,550
...National Film Award Winner…

1262
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,250
…Our Prince…

1263
00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:27,880
…Our Appu…

1264
00:59:33,710 --> 00:59:34,630
Please welcome,

1265
00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:36,670
Power Star Puneeth Rajkumar!

1266
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:39,170
(cheering)

1267
00:59:39,170 --> 00:59:41,000
(applause)

1268
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:43,380
Thank you.

1269
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:45,800
Thank you all

1270
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:48,170
for making me a part of your Annual Day celebration.

1271
00:59:48,170 --> 00:59:51,050
I would like to say a few words.

1272
00:59:51,050 --> 00:59:52,630
By only taking,

1273
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:55,210
You are nothing but selfish.

1274
00:59:57,420 --> 00:59:59,340
Love grows by giving,

1275
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:01,210
and not by taking.

1276
01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:02,340
Engineer,

1277
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:03,300
Doctor,

1278
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:04,750
CEO,

1279
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:05,920
Actor,

1280
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:06,710
Teacher,

1281
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:09,630
whatever career you choose…Just remember,

1282
01:00:09,630 --> 01:00:12,300
The more you give, the more you shall receive.

1283
01:00:13,590 --> 01:00:14,500
Thank you!

1284
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:22,840
Excuse me, Brother!

1285
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:23,960
Who is this?

1286
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:25,380
Area Corporator.

1287
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:27,170
Co-chief guest!

1288
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:34,340
Oh! Power star!

1289
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:37,500
So your house doesn’t have any power cuts?

1290
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:42,880
Oh, your glasses too have Power?

1291
01:00:46,630 --> 01:00:47,170
Look,

1292
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:51,550
I respect the love I get from the people…

1293
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:55,170
And I will never misuse the title of Power Star!

1294
01:00:55,170 --> 01:00:56,590
Hope this clears it for you.

1295
01:00:57,340 --> 01:00:59,250
What a powerful thought!

1296
01:00:59,250 --> 01:01:00,800
Power Star!

1297
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:01,800
Power Saar!

1298
01:01:04,710 --> 01:01:06,130
This is my business card.

1299
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:07,800
I am also trying to find power for myself.

1300
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:08,880
Please call me.

1301
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,460
I am a little busy now.

1302
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:14,090
We will hangout later like a fun world or

1303
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:15,840
gym…

1304
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:17,300
Juice center…

1305
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:19,590
Snow world also…

1306
01:01:19,590 --> 01:01:24,550
If you are free, we can go to Commercial Street and shop for Sarees…

1307
01:01:28,210 --> 01:01:30,420
You have to do good work,

1308
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:33,630
which makes the Public take notice.

1309
01:01:33,630 --> 01:01:34,460
Monjunath,

1310
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:36,590
For me to come power,

1311
01:01:36,590 --> 01:01:38,500
we have to cut people’s power

1312
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:39,920
Come on!

1313
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:51,500
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

1314
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:52,300
Monjunath,

1315
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:52,840
Sir..

1316
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:54,710
Look here. He looks like a man with bad intentions.

1317
01:01:54,710 --> 01:01:55,670
Click on him.

1318
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:58,880
Greetings, Kempiah!

1319
01:01:59,130 --> 01:02:00,550
Greetings, Sir!

1320
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,250
What is your cheapness level?

1321
01:02:02,250 --> 01:02:03,500
Highest, sir!

1322
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:07,710
Do you have a bribe count?

1323
01:02:07,710 --> 01:02:08,920
Have lost count, sir.

1324
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:09,960
Guarantee?

1325
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:11,340
Security?

1326
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:12,210
Yeah!

1327
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:14,170
See sir!

1328
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:16,170
My family is the security.

1329
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:17,670
Whatever you want you can do with them.

1330
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:19,380
Oh! Kempiah!

1331
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:20,130
Lovely!

1332
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:24,630
Please cut the electricity now.

1333
01:02:24,630 --> 01:02:26,170
Sir, but what do I say to the public?

1334
01:02:26,170 --> 01:02:27,340
Say anything, man.

1335
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:30,500
Like transformers have bursted or like…

1336
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:32,460
…heavy winds have damaged the poles.

1337
01:02:32,590 --> 01:02:33,590
Okay it's a deal!

1338
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:35,050
High five!

1339
01:02:35,050 --> 01:02:36,460
Okay sir!

1340
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:37,550
Yeah like that…

1341
01:02:37,550 --> 01:02:37,920
Bye sir!

1342
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:38,880
Bye!

1343
01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:43,960
Nivvi,

1344
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:45,340
you have to finish the soup…

1345
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:45,800
Okay.

1346
01:02:46,590 --> 01:02:47,210
Its nice, right?

1347
01:02:47,550 --> 01:02:48,340
Yes.

1348
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,250
(music)

1349
01:03:29,090 --> 01:03:30,710
Because of no electricity,

1350
01:03:30,710 --> 01:03:32,590
we have stopped the stability testing work.

1351
01:03:33,550 --> 01:03:35,050
In the meantime, the generators are refuelling.

1352
01:03:35,630 --> 01:03:36,050
It is okay.

1353
01:03:36,050 --> 01:03:37,630
Don’t put pressure on the lab to finish work.

1354
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:40,420
If another company gets approval before us,

1355
01:03:40,420 --> 01:03:41,090
It is fine!

1356
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:42,880
Let’s not cut corners anywhere.

1357
01:03:45,670 --> 01:03:47,550
When is our meeting with the medicine controller?

1358
01:03:47,550 --> 01:03:49,210
Sir, day after.

1359
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:51,840
Its better to get the approval on our file when you meet him…

1360
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:54,090
Because, its very difficult to get appointments with these officials.

1361
01:03:54,090 --> 01:03:54,840
I understand.

1362
01:03:58,670 --> 01:03:59,750
Greetings!

1363
01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:00,500
Dr. Shekhar!

1364
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:01,380
Sir, what are you doing here at this hour?

1365
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:02,920
May I please come in?

1366
01:04:03,710 --> 01:04:04,840
Sir, what is the meaning of this?

1367
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,460
You have a nice lower middle class home.

1368
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:12,170
Oh!

1369
01:04:12,170 --> 01:04:13,340
Babies!

1370
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:14,710
How is it?

1371
01:04:14,710 --> 01:04:16,420
Are you enjoying the poverty?

1372
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:17,920
Sir they have exams….

1373
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:18,800
What is this? Candles and all?

1374
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:20,130
Whose birthday today?

1375
01:04:20,130 --> 01:04:21,800
Sir, there is no current in the house since 2 days,

1376
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,000
It's a big problem...
I know!

1377
01:04:23,710 --> 01:04:25,000
That’s why I’m here!

1378
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,920
See, I’m really sorry.

1379
01:04:28,670 --> 01:04:32,460
In my constituency, my people don’t have electricity.

1380
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:33,630
It reflects badly on me.

1381
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:35,710
I know,

1382
01:04:35,710 --> 01:04:37,340
You think I am a bad person.

1383
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:41,670
Monjunath,

1384
01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:42,300
Sir?

1385
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:44,670
Call the electricity board.

1386
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:46,960
What’s he doing?

1387
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:52,750
Kempiah,

1388
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:54,130
what are you doing?

1389
01:04:54,130 --> 01:04:56,000
I am doing whatever you’ve said!

1390
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,630
Yesterday, you said the power will be back…

1391
01:04:58,630 --> 01:04:59,710
When did I say that?

1392
01:04:59,710 --> 01:05:01,630
No, I’m here at the quarters, and its dark everywhere.

1393
01:05:01,630 --> 01:05:03,750
People are sitting with candles,

1394
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:06,800
like they’re protesting at India Gate?

1395
01:05:08,090 --> 01:05:08,920
I am warning you!

1396
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:11,000
If you don't bring the power back on,

1397
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,590
I will definitely go in a hunger strike!

1398
01:05:12,590 --> 01:05:13,840
Hunger Strike?

1399
01:05:14,250 --> 01:05:16,630
No Kempiah, we spoke yesterday,

1400
01:05:16,630 --> 01:05:18,630
why hasn’t the electricity come back yet?

1401
01:05:18,630 --> 01:05:21,210
Don’t argue! Kempiah,

1402
01:05:21,210 --> 01:05:23,130
if you don’t switch on the electricity right now,

1403
01:05:23,130 --> 01:05:23,920
I’m going to…

1404
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:26,250
Cut myself!

1405
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:28,170
Sir, people are watching sir!

1406
01:05:28,170 --> 01:05:29,880
Please don’t do this in my house…

1407
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:30,670
Please sir…

1408
01:05:30,670 --> 01:05:32,130
This is for my Mom!

1409
01:05:32,130 --> 01:05:35,880
Baby, you count backwards from 5…Count…

1410
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:37,090
54321…

1411
01:05:38,420 --> 01:05:39,880
Slowly child…

1412
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:41,750
Now count…

1413
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:42,460
Sir, no sir…

1414
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:42,800
3..

1415
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:44,090
No, no, you don't talk…

1416
01:05:44,090 --> 01:05:46,000
Sir, please stop this drama…

1417
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:47,050
Aye.. Switch on

1418
01:05:47,050 --> 01:05:47,590
2...

1419
01:05:47,590 --> 01:05:49,250
Please sir, please!

1420
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:51,500
1.

1421
01:05:57,460 --> 01:05:58,500
Aye! Switch it on!

1422
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:07,050
Sir…

1423
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:11,630
Sir...sir…

1424
01:06:18,710 --> 01:06:21,000
Kempiah, I’m going to kill myself now…

1425
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
No sir! Electricity will come back now, wait…

1426
01:06:23,630 --> 01:06:24,420
3...

1427
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:25,670
Sir!

1428
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:27,880
2...

1429
01:06:28,090 --> 01:06:29,170
Try here! Here!

1430
01:06:30,710 --> 01:06:31,800
Sir! Sir!

1431
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:33,420
1.

1432
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:38,420
Kempu!

1433
01:06:39,380 --> 01:06:40,800
Take the band-aid, Sir…

1434
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:54,710
Baby!

1435
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:00,210
My son would have failed...

1436
01:07:00,210 --> 01:07:01,750
...because of these power cuts,

1437
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:03,960
…but our Corporator Nograj helped a great deal.

1438
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:04,750
How?

1439
01:07:04,750 --> 01:07:06,500
He cut his wrist to bring the power back on…

1440
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:07,340
Really?

1441
01:07:07,630 --> 01:07:10,750
The new light of ONE BIG PARTY is here…

1442
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:14,300
And he is DS Nagar’s Corporator Mr. Nograj,who cut his hand…

1443
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:17,550
so that his area people could have electricity.

1444
01:07:17,550 --> 01:07:21,050
Over to our correspondent Shalini for more updates

1445
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:33,210
Without chicken in his meal, Monjunath just cannot eat his food…

1446
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:36,920
Nograj,

1447
01:07:37,630 --> 01:07:39,550
only both of us can go inside…

1448
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:41,800
Gurudas, what are you saying ya?

1449
01:07:42,380 --> 01:07:43,250
Don't misunderstand me.

1450
01:07:43,550 --> 01:07:45,590
Our Vice President hates the number 2.

1451
01:07:46,050 --> 01:07:50,050
While talking to him, please avoid using the number 2…

1452
01:07:50,050 --> 01:07:51,550
Why? What is the reason?

1453
01:07:51,550 --> 01:07:54,090
Because he has been at the number 2 position all his life…

1454
01:07:54,090 --> 01:07:54,670
Yes..

1455
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:56,710
Why, because our President isn’t…

1456
01:08:01,130 --> 01:08:01,960
Hey,

1457
01:08:03,170 --> 01:08:04,750
I am still alive!

1458
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:07,920
Yeah, yeah,

1459
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:08,960
he is not dying also.

1460
01:08:09,550 --> 01:08:11,130
Okay. Monjunath, you stay here!

1461
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:14,300
Come! Hey, leave my hand I say…

1462
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:28,960
Guru told me

1463
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:30,880
that you were behind the downfall of MLA JFK?

1464
01:08:31,210 --> 01:08:32,000
Yes sir!

1465
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:34,090
Just 2 ideas?

1466
01:08:34,090 --> 01:08:34,960
Hunh?

1467
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:39,130
One and a half!

1468
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:40,920
Look,

1469
01:08:41,710 --> 01:08:42,840
because of what you’ve done,

1470
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:44,880
our party’s reputation is on the line….

1471
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:45,840
Do you know that?

1472
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:46,710
I know sir.

1473
01:08:46,710 --> 01:08:50,130
I did it so that JFK shouldn’t have a chance to become an MLA again.

1474
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:54,420
I know, our Party’s name has been tarnished a little,

1475
01:08:55,710 --> 01:08:57,000
but we can always change that.

1476
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:58,250
That is not a problem.

1477
01:08:58,250 --> 01:09:00,300
How can you say, there’s no problem?

1478
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:00,920
Sir..

1479
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:02,500
As a politician,

1480
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:03,750
what is my main job?

1481
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:06,000
To make money and to share money.

1482
01:09:07,590 --> 01:09:10,380
Here, the money made by us in the No-Parking Scam.

1483
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:11,550
In these 2 bags…

1484
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:16,880
Uh…in 1 bag.

1485
01:09:22,340 --> 01:09:23,250
Let’s go.

1486
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:26,050
Let's introduce him to the President.

1487
01:09:26,050 --> 01:09:27,050
Okay sir.

1488
01:09:27,050 --> 01:09:28,340
Come on.

1489
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:35,420
Shankar, what is the nature of this medicine controller?

1490
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:38,460
Sir, you know how Government Officials are right..?

1491
01:09:41,630 --> 01:09:44,380
Look, your application is almost clear,

1492
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:47,170
but what is this new medicine?

1493
01:09:47,170 --> 01:09:48,590
Its a stress reliever.

1494
01:09:48,590 --> 01:09:50,050
According to my team,

1495
01:09:50,050 --> 01:09:51,670
some work is still not complete.

1496
01:09:51,670 --> 01:09:54,210
one item is facility related

1497
01:09:54,210 --> 01:09:57,210
and the other one is with respect to safety report.

1498
01:09:57,210 --> 01:10:00,590
For us to give you a safe and effective certificate for this medicine,

1499
01:10:00,590 --> 01:10:02,840
you will have to pay 75 lakhs.

1500
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:03,920
Sir, respectfully,

1501
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:08,340
I can resubmit the files after rectifiying these two points.

1502
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:12,210
In that case, I can’t say how many more months it’ll take for the approval.

1503
01:10:12,210 --> 01:10:14,800
Also, a lot of our files sometimes go missing.

1504
01:10:15,550 --> 01:10:17,300
Pay 75 lakhs

1505
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:19,800
I’ll make sure to have your medicine in the market within 2 months.

1506
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:21,550
What Patil?

1507
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:22,420
Fine?

1508
01:10:23,630 --> 01:10:25,250
I’ll get this done in a week’s time.

1509
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:27,250
3 days is better for us, and for you.

1510
01:10:27,250 --> 01:10:29,590
Otherwise, I can’t really do anything to push for approval.

1511
01:10:30,670 --> 01:10:31,420
Where was I?

1512
01:10:31,420 --> 01:10:34,130
Yeah, point number 7…

1513
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:42,210
Respected chameleon,

1514
01:10:42,210 --> 01:10:43,460
please give me your blessings.

1515
01:10:53,210 --> 01:10:54,840
Greetings, Sir!

1516
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:59,750
It is really nice to meet you Nograj!

1517
01:11:00,170 --> 01:11:01,840
I have to tell you this,

1518
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:04,800
Only making money is not important...

1519
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:07,380
...The most important thing is your pubic image!

1520
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:10,130
See, you know everything about Politics,

1521
01:11:10,130 --> 01:11:12,210
because you’ve been here forever

1522
01:11:12,210 --> 01:11:13,170
He’s saying:

1523
01:11:13,170 --> 01:11:14,630
without the Public’s support,

1524
01:11:14,630 --> 01:11:16,460
you cannot progress in Politics.

1525
01:11:16,710 --> 01:11:17,750
Nograj,

1526
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:20,500
I’ve given the approval…

1527
01:11:22,170 --> 01:11:24,090
The approval for you to run in the upcoming MLA elections

1528
01:11:24,090 --> 01:11:26,420
As a representative of our party.

1529
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:29,710
Here, take this…

1530
01:11:29,710 --> 01:11:31,090
(laughs)

1531
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:51,300
Thank you Sir!

1532
01:11:52,670 --> 01:11:55,090
We need great leaders, not just politicians.

1533
01:11:55,090 --> 01:11:56,880
Using their top positions, they should figure out ways

1534
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,420
To rid our city from all its problems.

1535
01:11:58,670 --> 01:12:01,170
May I take 2 buckets of water from you?

1536
01:12:03,130 --> 01:12:05,630
Go to the Traffic Police. Why have you come here?

1537
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:09,630
Pay 75 lakhs

1538
01:12:09,630 --> 01:12:12,090
I’ll make sure to have your medicine in the market within 2 months.

1539
01:12:12,090 --> 01:12:13,090
Arun!

1540
01:12:13,630 --> 01:12:15,130
Politics and you?

1541
01:12:15,130 --> 01:12:16,590
Are you sure?

1542
01:12:18,210 --> 01:12:20,500
I am not joining Politics,

1543
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:21,800
I am doing this as a service.

1544
01:12:22,590 --> 01:12:23,920
When I came to India from the US

1545
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:27,050
it was risky to start a Pharma Company…

1546
01:12:27,050 --> 01:12:29,050
But we did venture into it, without doing anything illegally…

1547
01:12:29,050 --> 01:12:31,380
...and without comprimising on anything

1548
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:33,130
We’ve made our company successful.

1549
01:12:33,130 --> 01:12:36,340
We know you are doing this with pure intentions…

1550
01:12:36,340 --> 01:12:39,750
But its difficult to pursue politics without approaching things illegally.

1551
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:41,130
Yes, its almost impossible.

1552
01:12:41,130 --> 01:12:42,960
Thank you. I appreciate your concern.

1553
01:12:44,050 --> 01:12:46,380
I want to focus on the issues in our state.

1554
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:48,090
I was born and brought up here.

1555
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:49,800
I love Karnataka.

1556
01:12:50,630 --> 01:12:53,170
Most people here only talk about our State problems…

1557
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:57,420
Let me try and focus on the solutions.

1558
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:04,210
Look Arun,

1559
01:13:05,090 --> 01:13:06,130
you have our support.

1560
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:08,050
Thank you, I appreciate it.

1561
01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:23,250
(Arun thinks)

1562
01:13:51,210 --> 01:13:54,710
Karnataka, my mom,

1563
01:13:54,710 --> 01:13:59,380
please help me make more money for myself.

1564
01:13:59,380 --> 01:14:00,420
Please bless me.

1565
01:14:02,210 --> 01:14:03,710
You all know,

1566
01:14:04,210 --> 01:14:06,050
I’ve got the election ticket.

1567
01:14:06,590 --> 01:14:10,170
So, I am going to be the next MLA of this constituency.

1568
01:14:10,630 --> 01:14:11,460
Let’s make sure,

1569
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:12,420
I only win the elections.

1570
01:14:12,420 --> 01:14:13,210
Okay..

1571
01:14:13,210 --> 01:14:15,420
We have to create a strong buzz in the Press.

1572
01:14:15,420 --> 01:14:16,630
Yes sir.

1573
01:14:16,630 --> 01:14:19,880
Monjunath, organise a photo shoot.

1574
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:21,550
We will snap many pictures,

1575
01:14:21,550 --> 01:14:22,800
Inform everyone that

1576
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:25,840
Nograj Sir is the best MLA candidate.

1577
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:26,300
Okay?

1578
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:27,050
Yes sir.

1579
01:14:28,750 --> 01:14:29,550
Yeah! Nice!

1580
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:30,710
Monjunath!

1581
01:14:30,710 --> 01:14:31,800
Let’s start!

1582
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:32,340
What is the first pose?

1583
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:33,750
Humble Pose!

1584
01:14:33,750 --> 01:14:34,500
Yeah!

1585
01:14:36,420 --> 01:14:39,250
Sir, we need a little more softness...

1586
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:39,880
...in the eyes.

1587
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:41,500
Okay, yeah…

1588
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:45,590
Sir, sir, softness sir…

1589
01:14:45,590 --> 01:14:48,340
Monjunath, how can I express softness through my eyes?

1590
01:14:48,340 --> 01:14:49,420
Humble is here.

1591
01:14:49,420 --> 01:14:51,090
Not here, okay. Please!

1592
01:14:51,090 --> 01:14:51,840
Yes sir!

1593
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:54,000
I’ll keep donning poses, you please take pictures.

1594
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,800
First one is – Climbing Mount Everest.

1595
01:14:59,130 --> 01:15:00,500
Happy Deepavali!

1596
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:03,500
Bakri-Eid Mubarak!

1597
01:15:05,210 --> 01:15:06,550
Jingle Balls!

1598
01:15:06,550 --> 01:15:07,960
Bells, bells…

1599
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:09,550
Okay, yeah…

1600
01:15:09,550 --> 01:15:10,960
Jingle Bells!

1601
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:12,460
Merry Christmas!

1602
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:13,880
War!

1603
01:15:16,670 --> 01:15:18,550
Supporting Raitha (Curds)

1604
01:15:20,710 --> 01:15:22,380
Fool! Not Curds.

1605
01:15:22,380 --> 01:15:24,380
I mean’t Raitha, which is Farmer.

1606
01:15:27,550 --> 01:15:29,670
For the marketing of our campaign,

1607
01:15:29,670 --> 01:15:31,250
we need a unique idea.

1608
01:15:40,090 --> 01:15:40,800
Shankar,

1609
01:15:41,050 --> 01:15:42,050
I have an idea.

1610
01:15:42,050 --> 01:15:43,840
Let’s compose an email to marketing.

1611
01:15:45,380 --> 01:15:45,960
Slow down.

1612
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:47,960
Greetings. Yes, tell me!

1613
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:48,460
Tell me..

1614
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:49,300
Nograj sir…

1615
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:49,750
Yeah yeah…

1616
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:51,710
You’ve got the party ticket for the upcoming MLA elections…

1617
01:15:51,710 --> 01:15:52,210
Of course!

1618
01:15:52,210 --> 01:15:53,800
How do you feel fighting for your seat...

1619
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:55,380
...in such a competitive constituency?

1620
01:15:55,380 --> 01:15:56,090
Look Madam,

1621
01:15:56,090 --> 01:15:58,550
Actually, I am feeling very proud ....

1622
01:15:58,550 --> 01:16:00,300
...because my only competition is myself…

1623
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:02,750
...which means, I will win against myself.

1624
01:16:02,750 --> 01:16:05,590
Sir, do you have any plans before the election?

1625
01:16:05,590 --> 01:16:08,300
How are you planning to use the Local Area Development Funds?

1626
01:16:09,750 --> 01:16:10,800
Madam,

1627
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:13,670
we will use these funds completely.

1628
01:16:13,670 --> 01:16:14,750
We will not leave anything.

1629
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:16,880
Sir, you really like speaking in English.

1630
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:18,380
Is there a particular reason?

1631
01:16:18,380 --> 01:16:21,050
The particular reason, madam is…

1632
01:16:21,050 --> 01:16:23,920
My grandfather owned a lot of land.

1633
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:25,460
He was a farmer.

1634
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:28,420
Britishers met my grandfather,

1635
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:33,130
gave him a piece of paper and asked him to sign it.

1636
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:35,170
My poor grandfather couldn’t understand the document,

1637
01:16:35,170 --> 01:16:38,050
so he signed it and lost all his land.

1638
01:16:38,050 --> 01:16:40,590
My learning from this incident...

1639
01:16:40,590 --> 01:16:43,550
...is that you can cheat people in English.

1640
01:16:45,050 --> 01:16:50,920
But, in Karnataka, its impossible to fool Kannadigas in Kannada.

1641
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:52,460
I hope I’ve answered your question.

1642
01:16:52,460 --> 01:16:54,050
Sir, sir...one more question...

1643
01:16:54,050 --> 01:16:54,550
No!

1644
01:16:57,130 --> 01:16:59,090
Shankar, with this waste management...

1645
01:16:59,090 --> 01:17:00,460
...we need to protect the environment.

1646
01:17:00,460 --> 01:17:01,340
Let’s set up a factory

1647
01:17:01,340 --> 01:17:03,090
We can generate methane from this waste....

1648
01:17:03,090 --> 01:17:05,090
...and then use it for fuel and electricity.

1649
01:17:09,380 --> 01:17:10,590
There are no garbage bins in most places.

1650
01:17:10,590 --> 01:17:11,750
The garbage is on the road for the most part.

1651
01:17:11,750 --> 01:17:13,630
Owing to the flies and mosquitoes,

1652
01:17:13,630 --> 01:17:15,920
we have 30 dengue cases only in this layout Sir.

1653
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:18,800
Dry waste and wet waste is dumped in the same place.

1654
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:20,250
They don’t even separate it.

1655
01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:22,670
In the plan to Clean India, 1000 crores were allotted.

1656
01:17:22,670 --> 01:17:24,090
Even 1 rupee wasn’t spent on that plan.

1657
01:17:24,090 --> 01:17:25,340
How do you know?

1658
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:26,000
I know.

1659
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:26,920
I understand.

1660
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:30,420
Whatever I can do from my end, I’ll try and get it done as soon as possible.

1661
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:36,420
Sir, Arun Patil is on the move, campaigning door-to-door.

1662
01:17:36,420 --> 01:17:37,500
Who is that Manjunath?

1663
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:39,250
Sir,

1664
01:17:39,250 --> 01:17:42,090
He is running against you in the MLA election.

1665
01:17:42,090 --> 01:17:43,380
Oh, I thought I was the only one.

1666
01:17:44,130 --> 01:17:44,550
No sir…

1667
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:46,300
Is this a joke?

1668
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:47,380
No sir!

1669
01:17:47,380 --> 01:17:48,340
Monjunath!

1670
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:50,050
What is this attitude?

1671
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:50,920
No sir!

1672
01:17:51,380 --> 01:17:53,670
I’m getting new clothes stitched,

1673
01:17:53,670 --> 01:17:54,670
and that’s making you jealous?

1674
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:56,590
Let’s get your measurements.

1675
01:17:56,590 --> 01:17:57,170
You also need a shirt.

1676
01:17:57,170 --> 01:17:57,800
Stand!

1677
01:17:58,300 --> 01:17:59,050
Smile!

1678
01:17:59,420 --> 01:18:03,630
Shankar, our government had promised to build treatment plants,

1679
01:18:03,630 --> 01:18:04,460
has that happened?

1680
01:18:04,460 --> 01:18:05,170
Not yet Sir.

1681
01:18:05,170 --> 01:18:06,880
Find a space around our factory,

1682
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:09,420
Dig few pits and line it with a protective material…

1683
01:18:09,420 --> 01:18:11,800
To prevent the seepage of contaminated water…

1684
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:12,460
Okay Sir..

1685
01:18:12,460 --> 01:18:14,340
Sir, we have to select a symbol for our party.

1686
01:18:14,340 --> 01:18:16,500
The options available are…

1687
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:20,250
Banana, ice cream, harmonium, cake, camera, frock,

1688
01:18:20,250 --> 01:18:23,170
carrot, coconut, ceiling fan, balloon…

1689
01:18:23,170 --> 01:18:23,840
What?

1690
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:25,920
We have to send in three options

1691
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:27,800
and according to availability, they will give us 1.

1692
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:28,750
Let’s go with frock!

1693
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:29,670
Okay sir!

1694
01:18:30,750 --> 01:18:31,590
Shankar,

1695
01:18:31,590 --> 01:18:33,800
They have blackboard, book and brick as well.

1696
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:34,920
Select 1 from these options.

1697
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:36,300
Okay sir!

1698
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:56,710
Nice campaign this is…

1699
01:18:56,710 --> 01:18:57,460
Yeah?

1700
01:18:58,250 --> 01:18:59,630
Arun Patil!

1701
01:18:59,630 --> 01:19:01,210
Who is this new candidate?

1702
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:03,210
Independent mostly?

1703
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:04,630
Yeah.

1704
01:19:05,380 --> 01:19:07,300
What is our Nograj doing?

1705
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:12,840
(Moaning Sounds)

1706
01:19:25,550 --> 01:19:27,300
Nagu!

1707
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:28,750
What is the score, Monjunath?

1708
01:19:28,750 --> 01:19:29,880
Sir, deuce.

1709
01:19:30,090 --> 01:19:31,500
What are you saying ?

1710
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:32,590
What dues?

1711
01:19:32,590 --> 01:19:34,210
We don’t owe anybody anything!

1712
01:19:34,210 --> 01:19:35,590
People have to give us money!

1713
01:19:35,590 --> 01:19:37,090
40-30 Nagu.

1714
01:19:37,090 --> 01:19:38,000
My serve.

1715
01:19:39,460 --> 01:19:41,250
60-40, you take land!

1716
01:19:41,250 --> 01:19:42,000
I’ll give you a site, fine?

1717
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,590
I want 120 by 80.

1718
01:19:46,130 --> 01:19:47,300
Take it baby.

1719
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:48,170
Everything is yours!

1720
01:19:48,170 --> 01:19:49,300
Come on!

1721
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:52,090
But you will have to let me win!

1722
01:19:52,090 --> 01:19:53,500
I’m your husband. Okay?

1723
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:54,880
Don’t ever forget that.

1724
01:19:55,130 --> 01:19:56,500
Aye! Steffi Giraffe!

1725
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:57,880
Let’s play! I’ll serve!

1726
01:19:57,880 --> 01:19:59,250
Okay!

1727
01:20:14,340 --> 01:20:17,210
Mr. Patil figured out a solution to our garbage problem...

1728
01:20:17,210 --> 01:20:20,380
And helped us a lot, and that too in a very short time.

1729
01:20:20,380 --> 01:20:22,460
I’m not doing all this to become the MLA.

1730
01:20:22,460 --> 01:20:24,420
This is not a favour either.

1731
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:26,090
It is my duty.

1732
01:20:26,090 --> 01:20:27,590
Sorry, no more questions.

1733
01:20:27,590 --> 01:20:28,590
Sir… one more question…please….

1734
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:30,300
How nicely he spoke…

1735
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:32,630
He is such a good spokesperson…

1736
01:20:32,630 --> 01:20:35,050
Sir, before your first public speech,

1737
01:20:35,050 --> 01:20:37,380
we have to get our manifesto ready…

1738
01:20:37,380 --> 01:20:40,880
If people keep seeing Arun Patil do good work,

1739
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:42,750
they will vote for him Sir…

1740
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:46,630
Lavanya!

1741
01:20:47,460 --> 01:20:49,130
Put that Big Boss show…

1742
01:20:56,590 --> 01:20:57,960
Monjunath,

1743
01:20:58,630 --> 01:20:59,800
What are you doing?

1744
01:21:09,710 --> 01:21:11,670
What is the status of your campaign?

1745
01:21:11,670 --> 01:21:12,710
3 weeks are left…

1746
01:21:12,710 --> 01:21:14,130
2 weeks, Sir…

1747
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,630
How many times have you been told to not use that number?

1748
01:21:17,630 --> 01:21:18,920
2 times, Sir…

1749
01:21:19,340 --> 01:21:20,750
In your upcoming speech,

1750
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:23,130
you will have talk about your campaign with the Press…

1751
01:21:23,130 --> 01:21:24,670
Yes, will talk about it,

1752
01:21:24,670 --> 01:21:25,880
What is there in that?

1753
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:28,090
Do you know what is a manifesto?

1754
01:21:28,090 --> 01:21:29,420
Of course!

1755
01:21:31,090 --> 01:21:32,710
It is a cultural fest...

1756
01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:34,420
...for men!

1757
01:21:36,090 --> 01:21:37,420
What is your plan Nograj?

1758
01:21:37,420 --> 01:21:39,500
Its not enough to just have billboards.

1759
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:41,250
Do you have a strategy or not?

1760
01:21:41,250 --> 01:21:42,340
Strategy is there!

1761
01:21:42,340 --> 01:21:44,050
Strategy is a long term plan,

1762
01:21:44,050 --> 01:21:46,050
backed by a blueprint for a long term vision.

1763
01:21:46,050 --> 01:21:47,170
Now the vision is short,

1764
01:21:47,170 --> 01:21:48,380
why? Because the time is short.

1765
01:21:48,380 --> 01:21:50,130
And in that short time I cannot do anything.

1766
01:21:50,130 --> 01:21:53,050
Which means, in the short time I am going to call it the master plan

1767
01:21:53,050 --> 01:21:54,880
That is my long term..

1768
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:56,170
...plan of action.

1769
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:03,590
When will your manifesto be ready?

1770
01:22:04,670 --> 01:22:05,340
2 days sir!

1771
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:09,210
Okay okay, 1 day, 1 day…

1772
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:12,960
What is this Guru?

1773
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:13,800
Don't!

1774
01:22:16,550 --> 01:22:17,590
No, don’t talk to me…

1775
01:22:17,590 --> 01:22:18,800
Sir, Sir…

1776
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:19,590
Monjunath!

1777
01:22:19,590 --> 01:22:20,630
What the bloody hell?

1778
01:22:20,630 --> 01:22:22,380
Whose work is it to make the manifesto?

1779
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:24,000
Sir, you have to tell me about that…

1780
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,840
Monjunath, what do I know?

1781
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:27,460
Have I become an MLA before?

1782
01:22:27,460 --> 01:22:30,090
Please don’t talk like a rascal!

1783
01:22:30,090 --> 01:22:31,420
No sir! That…

1784
01:22:31,420 --> 01:22:32,840
Don’t argue with me Monjunath!

1785
01:22:35,340 --> 01:22:37,380
Get your hands on Arun Patil’s manifesto,

1786
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:39,300
copy it,

1787
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:41,130
...and put XX everywhere

1788
01:22:41,130 --> 01:22:42,250
XX meaning?⁠⁠⁠⁠

1789
01:22:42,250 --> 01:22:43,460
Monjunath,

1790
01:22:43,460 --> 01:22:45,960
whatever is written in his manifesto, we shall do the same.

1791
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:47,380
Only difference is

1792
01:22:47,380 --> 01:22:49,800
that we will double everything he does.

1793
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:51,090
Example.

1794
01:22:51,090 --> 01:22:54,550
His manifesto has allotted 1000 crores for infrastructure work.

1795
01:22:54,550 --> 01:22:57,210
We will allot 2000 crores.

1796
01:22:57,210 --> 01:22:58,750
For instance, he has written that Security...

1797
01:22:58,750 --> 01:23:00,590
... will be provided for 10 women…

1798
01:23:00,590 --> 01:23:02,210
We will provide security for...

1799
01:23:02,210 --> 01:23:03,500
...20 men.

1800
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:04,800
For women, right?

1801
01:23:05,590 --> 01:23:06,590
Monjunath,

1802
01:23:07,130 --> 01:23:08,880
If we keep the men safe,

1803
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:12,380
we will automatically secure the safety of women.

1804
01:23:12,380 --> 01:23:13,000
Yeah…

1805
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:13,710
Okay Sir,

1806
01:23:13,710 --> 01:23:17,300
but how will we get Arun Patil’s manifesto?

1807
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:23,750
Sir, is robbery a good idea?

1808
01:23:23,750 --> 01:23:25,050
Always Monjunath!

1809
01:23:25,050 --> 01:23:26,800
We are politicians!

1810
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:42,000
Monjunath!

1811
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,250
Nograj sir!

1812
01:23:43,250 --> 01:23:45,000
Monjunath!

1813
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:47,710
Sir!

1814
01:24:10,130 --> 01:24:11,590
Give me a hair pin.

1815
01:24:11,590 --> 01:24:14,130
Sir, this is a digital locker. We need a password to open this.

1816
01:24:14,130 --> 01:24:15,000
Try like

1817
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Lavanya

1818
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:17,920
Pramod

1819
01:24:18,460 --> 01:24:19,840
12345.

1820
01:24:22,300 --> 01:24:23,630
Monjunath!

1821
01:24:24,250 --> 01:24:26,710
This was supposed to be a mission possible.

1822
01:24:26,710 --> 01:24:29,170
We came here to play games or what?

1823
01:24:29,170 --> 01:24:30,250
We have come to rob.

1824
01:24:30,250 --> 01:24:32,380
Where is your robbery tool kit?

1825
01:24:32,380 --> 01:24:33,460
Sir that…

1826
01:24:33,460 --> 01:24:34,710
Shut up rascal!

1827
01:24:34,710 --> 01:24:36,880
Look for it and download it from the internet.

1828
01:24:39,090 --> 01:24:40,300
Come here…

1829
01:24:50,710 --> 01:24:52,710
Who is this idiot?

1830
01:24:59,170 --> 01:25:00,380
Arun Patil!

1831
01:25:00,380 --> 01:25:02,920
Not taken!

1832
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:04,460
I haven’t taken anything.

1833
01:25:04,460 --> 01:25:05,750
Look! Nothing! See! Nothing!

1834
01:25:05,750 --> 01:25:06,880
Nothing!

1835
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:08,960
See! Nothing!

1836
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:09,710
Oh no! Sir!

1837
01:25:09,710 --> 01:25:11,630
Cameras Sir!

1838
01:25:11,630 --> 01:25:13,210
Cover your face Sir!

1839
01:25:14,130 --> 01:25:15,550
Bye!

1840
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:19,000
Shankar, dismiss the guards that were on security last night.

1841
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,800
Sir, but they haven’t taken anything.

1842
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:22,170
That’s not the point Shankar.

1843
01:25:22,170 --> 01:25:23,840
It was so easy for them to break into our company like this.

1844
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:25,170
This is a serious security breach.

1845
01:25:27,210 --> 01:25:28,630
We aren’t interested in Politics, Sir.

1846
01:25:28,630 --> 01:25:30,960
We’re here only cause we are getting free attendance.

1847
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:34,170
Sir, if we don’t vote, what’s the big deal?

1848
01:25:34,170 --> 01:25:36,380
Just like IPL Season, Kabaddi,

1849
01:25:36,380 --> 01:25:38,050
this is your Election Season.

1850
01:25:38,050 --> 01:25:39,590
First, you come looking for us for our votes.

1851
01:25:39,590 --> 01:25:41,630
After the election, we have to keep searching for you to solve our issues.

1852
01:25:41,630 --> 01:25:42,840
That’s the whole game, isn’t it?

1853
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:44,130
You are right,

1854
01:25:44,130 --> 01:25:45,800
but if you don’t vote

1855
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:48,590
how are you going to express your choice to the system?

1856
01:25:48,590 --> 01:25:50,000
Showing how you feel through your vote

1857
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,550
gives us a chance for positive change.

1858
01:25:52,550 --> 01:25:54,420
This election has good candidates,

1859
01:25:54,420 --> 01:25:56,500
but nobody wants to support them.

1860
01:25:56,500 --> 01:25:59,710
They can bring about change and do good work,

1861
01:25:59,710 --> 01:26:00,420
but nobody wants to believe in them.

1862
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:05,800
(Wrestling on TV)

1863
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:09,420
Hello! Wait outside!

1864
01:26:09,420 --> 01:26:11,000
Sir is busy, he will meet you later!

1865
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,210
Wait outside!

1866
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:16,000
Sir, we have to submit our manifesto on the Internet.

1867
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,420
I think, we can find...

1868
01:26:18,420 --> 01:26:20,090
...Arun Patil’s manifesto online as well.

1869
01:26:20,090 --> 01:26:21,380
I knew it.

1870
01:26:21,380 --> 01:26:22,920
Download it.

1871
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:24,300
Sir, but that….

1872
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:25,420
What? The Robbery?

1873
01:26:26,130 --> 01:26:28,710
Are you insinuating that the robbery was my idea?

1874
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:30,250
Rascal! What do you mean?

1875
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:31,750
It was your idea.

1876
01:26:31,750 --> 01:26:32,250
Sir?

1877
01:26:32,250 --> 01:26:34,590
If I tell you not to marry, you won't get married is it?

1878
01:26:35,460 --> 01:26:36,550
It’s okay Sir.

1879
01:26:36,550 --> 01:26:38,500
Let’s talk about the rally.

1880
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:39,460
Yeah!

1881
01:26:39,460 --> 01:26:41,130
When I arrive at the rally,

1882
01:26:41,130 --> 01:26:42,670
There should be a huge crowd waiting for me.

1883
01:26:42,670 --> 01:26:46,840
I want them to be loud and create havoc.

1884
01:26:48,170 --> 01:26:49,710
Pay them.

1885
01:26:49,710 --> 01:26:50,420
Their energy should project to everyone ...

1886
01:26:50,420 --> 01:26:52,420
...around that I’ve become really popular.

1887
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:02,550
Eat this, and use your voices to Shout and Cheer.

1888
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:03,420
Get it?

1889
01:27:07,250 --> 01:27:08,630
Nagu,

1890
01:27:08,630 --> 01:27:09,590
so many Nagus.

1891
01:27:10,170 --> 01:27:11,710
You are a superstar.

1892
01:27:12,460 --> 01:27:13,550
Monjunath! Rascal!

1893
01:27:13,550 --> 01:27:14,250
What is this?

1894
01:27:14,250 --> 01:27:15,090
Sir! Crowd, sir!

1895
01:27:15,090 --> 01:27:16,130
I asked you to bring Crowd.

1896
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:17,170
You’ve got Goons.

1897
01:27:17,710 --> 01:27:18,460
Call that Bette gowda!

1898
01:27:18,460 --> 01:27:19,670
Ask him to fire his gun.

1899
01:27:19,670 --> 01:27:20,300
Nonsense!

1900
01:27:20,300 --> 01:27:21,550
Move...move…

1901
01:27:22,170 --> 01:27:22,630
Hi…

1902
01:27:22,630 --> 01:27:24,380
Lavanya, I am here. Those people aren’t me!

1903
01:27:25,710 --> 01:27:26,840
Bette Gowda.

1904
01:27:33,090 --> 01:27:34,170
Up Up Nograj!

1905
01:27:34,170 --> 01:27:35,250
All hail Nograj!

1906
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:38,420
Greetings! My dear friends!

1907
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:39,880
Nograj! All hail Nograj!

1908
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:42,090
Greetings! My dear friends!

1909
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:43,380
Up Up Nograj!

1910
01:27:43,630 --> 01:27:44,590
Shut up!

1911
01:27:46,090 --> 01:27:48,170
Do you want your money or no?

1912
01:27:49,210 --> 01:27:50,800
I am the one giving it to you.

1913
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:54,840
So, please don’t fake it that I am your favourite political leader.

1914
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:56,130
Please don’t act.

1915
01:27:57,460 --> 01:27:59,090
First, look around you!

1916
01:27:59,090 --> 01:28:00,590
Can you see any members of the Press or Media?

1917
01:28:02,340 --> 01:28:05,630
No. No one is recording this rally.

1918
01:28:05,630 --> 01:28:07,000
Now, let’s start this…

1919
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,550
First, tell me.

1920
01:28:08,550 --> 01:28:10,210
How many poor people in the house?

1921
01:28:10,210 --> 01:28:12,300
Make some noise!

1922
01:28:13,630 --> 01:28:17,050
Okay, for all of you to vote for me,

1923
01:28:17,050 --> 01:28:20,210
you need to know what’s written in my Manifesto.

1924
01:28:20,210 --> 01:28:22,590
I know you haven’t read it,

1925
01:28:22,590 --> 01:28:23,920
So let me read it for you.

1926
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:25,340
For rural areas,

1927
01:28:25,340 --> 01:28:28,050
we will turn all the temporary houses into proper homes

1928
01:28:28,050 --> 01:28:29,880
in the next 5 years.

1929
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:31,210
Along with that,

1930
01:28:31,210 --> 01:28:32,090
every home..

1931
01:28:32,090 --> 01:28:33,460
...will have an..

1932
01:28:33,460 --> 01:28:34,960
...individual toilet!

1933
01:28:39,590 --> 01:28:42,300
Sanitation and Infrastructure are very important!

1934
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:44,300
You know about RTI,

1935
01:28:44,300 --> 01:28:46,050
which means, you have the right to information.

1936
01:28:46,050 --> 01:28:49,090
If we announce a 20 crores infrastructure project,

1937
01:28:49,090 --> 01:28:52,090
you can ask us how we have spent this money.

1938
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:54,250
Take the microphone to him…

1939
01:28:55,250 --> 01:28:56,250
That poor fellow, yeah!

1940
01:28:56,250 --> 01:28:57,210
Brother,

1941
01:28:57,210 --> 01:29:00,170
Tell me how many zeroes are there in 20 crores?

1942
01:29:02,090 --> 01:29:04,340
See,

1943
01:29:04,340 --> 01:29:07,500
from that amount, if I take 2 or 5 crores,

1944
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:09,380
how will you know?

1945
01:29:10,710 --> 01:29:12,380
Do you have the time

1946
01:29:12,380 --> 01:29:15,500
to find out the cost of road, infrastructure, etc?

1947
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:19,630
It is possible to keep the roads in good condition throughout the year…

1948
01:29:19,630 --> 01:29:21,460
… and not just during elections for the sake of votes.

1949
01:29:21,460 --> 01:29:24,210
You can also partner with the government

1950
01:29:24,210 --> 01:29:26,710
if you are a private agency aiming to aid our city’s development…

1951
01:29:27,090 --> 01:29:27,960
I need your help.

1952
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:30,800
Arun Patil is very lazy!

1953
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:33,420
Instead of helping you,

1954
01:29:33,420 --> 01:29:34,710
he is begging you.

1955
01:29:34,710 --> 01:29:37,800
Because a leader is only as good as his team.

1956
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:39,500
With the introduction of Demonitization,

1957
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:41,670
we’ve all learned how to use Paytm.

1958
01:29:41,670 --> 01:29:43,210
That has merit.

1959
01:29:43,210 --> 01:29:46,630
All of these new ideas are not welcome!

1960
01:29:46,630 --> 01:29:47,800
Why we want to work..

1961
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:49,960
What is written outside my office?

1962
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:54,920
Government’s work is God’s work!

1963
01:29:54,920 --> 01:29:57,420
I am not God! I am Nograj,

1964
01:29:57,420 --> 01:29:59,050
so why should I work?

1965
01:29:59,420 --> 01:30:01,380
Lets come together as people.

1966
01:30:01,380 --> 01:30:03,710
Traffic can be reduced during peak hours

1967
01:30:03,710 --> 01:30:06,590
if companies agree to change their shift timings.

1968
01:30:06,590 --> 01:30:09,130
Let’s create a new effective system.

1969
01:30:09,130 --> 01:30:10,380
What system?

1970
01:30:10,380 --> 01:30:14,670
You can’t commute based on a plan that changes your schedule.

1971
01:30:14,670 --> 01:30:18,800
Traffic problems cannot be handled in a creative way!

1972
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:20,750
If you see any crime happening in front of your eyes,

1973
01:30:20,750 --> 01:30:21,840
stop it

1974
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:23,170
or at least try to stop it!

1975
01:30:23,170 --> 01:30:25,050
Or report it to the Police.

1976
01:30:25,050 --> 01:30:26,920
We have to do something.

1977
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:27,630
You can’t…

1978
01:30:27,630 --> 01:30:29,000
… Just watch!

1979
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:30,500
Don’t do anything.

1980
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:33,670
Tomorrow, you’ll attend a music show.

1981
01:30:33,670 --> 01:30:34,500
You’re watching.

1982
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:39,300
You won't end up on stage and play a mouth organ

1983
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:43,210
or suddenly start playing the drums.

1984
01:30:43,210 --> 01:30:44,170
You just have to watch!

1985
01:30:44,170 --> 01:30:46,550
Ladies, old people,

1986
01:30:46,550 --> 01:30:48,380
for your security,

1987
01:30:48,380 --> 01:30:50,050
I have an idea.

1988
01:30:50,050 --> 01:30:52,550
Stay at home!

1989
01:30:52,550 --> 01:30:54,130
Don’t come out!

1990
01:30:54,130 --> 01:30:56,590
If we are together,

1991
01:30:56,590 --> 01:30:59,090
We can change a lot of things in the next five years!

1992
01:30:59,460 --> 01:31:02,210
Forget about the next five years!

1993
01:31:02,210 --> 01:31:05,840
For the next 5 months, just follow my political campaign.

1994
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:08,210
Instead of giving more speeches, I’d like to show you the difference…

1995
01:31:08,210 --> 01:31:10,050
…by working and putting plans in place.

1996
01:31:16,460 --> 01:31:20,300
Why will I do something for you?

1997
01:31:20,300 --> 01:31:23,300
Only if I like you,

1998
01:31:23,300 --> 01:31:26,170
I will do something for you.

1999
01:31:26,170 --> 01:31:27,750
And how will I like you?

2000
01:31:28,130 --> 01:31:31,670
Please vote for me.

2001
01:31:31,670 --> 01:31:33,420
Come in! Go! Go!

2002
01:31:33,420 --> 01:31:34,960
As a leader,

2003
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:37,880
now I’ll say few common speech dialogues.

2004
01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:40,710
All of you have to do is shout and clap.

2005
01:31:40,710 --> 01:31:44,050
India will become great again!

2006
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:49,250
Ladies will have equal opportunities!

2007
01:31:50,590 --> 01:31:54,670
We will eradicate this country!

2008
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:55,710
No, no! I meant,

2009
01:31:55,710 --> 01:31:59,750
we will eradicate the poverty from this country.

2010
01:31:59,750 --> 01:32:03,590
Let us make our constituency great again!

2011
01:32:03,590 --> 01:32:05,210
Victory to India!

2012
01:32:05,210 --> 01:32:07,840
Victory to Karnataka!

2013
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:14,630
Its heartwarming to see the involvement of the
youth in the upcoming MLA Elections.

2014
01:32:14,630 --> 01:32:16,000
Less than a month to go for the elections,

2015
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,670
and based on the calls and tweets we have received… Its clear that,

2016
01:32:18,670 --> 01:32:20,210
Arun Patil means business

2017
01:32:20,210 --> 01:32:22,210
and Nograj is making this a business.

2018
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:31,800
I know that you have exams coming up,

2019
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:36,420
and you must be stressed with all the power cuts.

2020
01:32:36,420 --> 01:32:37,550
Hope this helps you all.

2021
01:32:37,550 --> 01:32:39,550
All the best for your exams.

2022
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:41,050
Hey what's going on?

2023
01:32:41,050 --> 01:32:43,750
This Arun Patil is not just donating LED lights in your ward to children.

2024
01:32:43,750 --> 01:32:47,460
He has donated in other wards as well.

2025
01:32:47,460 --> 01:32:48,250
Nograj sir..

2026
01:32:48,250 --> 01:32:50,590
Aside from this, he has dug quite a few borewells as well.

2027
01:32:50,590 --> 01:32:53,670
He has also bought a few Water tankers
to offer water at the right prices.

2028
01:32:53,670 --> 01:32:56,420
Press is providing him with proper coverage.

2029
01:32:56,420 --> 01:32:57,840
What is this Azam Khan?

2030
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:00,840
When electricity problems came upon us, I said I will cut myself…

2031
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:02,300
…I will go on hunger strike.

2032
01:33:02,300 --> 01:33:03,800
Even just saying all of this is not a joke!

2033
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:05,750
Yeah, its not a joke.

2034
01:33:05,750 --> 01:33:07,630
I’ve done so much,

2035
01:33:07,630 --> 01:33:09,590
and these media people just want to ignore me.

2036
01:33:09,590 --> 01:33:11,460
Azam Khan, Blow on the side.

2037
01:33:13,050 --> 01:33:16,250
Smoking is injurious to health dear friends, please stop smoking.

2038
01:33:18,590 --> 01:33:20,210
What’s the update on the Water Issue?

2039
01:33:20,210 --> 01:33:22,300
Sir, there are quite a few suppliers.

2040
01:33:22,300 --> 01:33:24,500
When there is a shortage of water,

2041
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:27,460
some of them purify the borewell water and supply to people…

2042
01:33:27,460 --> 01:33:31,050
The water tankers that take water from the water board and supply

2043
01:33:31,050 --> 01:33:32,550
it to people at higher costs,

2044
01:33:32,550 --> 01:33:33,840
do you know who’s behind that?

2045
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:36,380
Only those who have many water tankers

2046
01:33:36,380 --> 01:33:40,090
work hand-in-hand with the Water Board.

2047
01:33:41,340 --> 01:33:43,050
According to my investigation,

2048
01:33:43,050 --> 01:33:44,880
Seems like this water mafia is run by....

2049
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:46,300
Pramod Water Works!⁠⁠⁠⁠

2050
01:33:47,130 --> 01:33:49,170
Were you able to find out the owner of Pramod Water Works?

2051
01:33:49,170 --> 01:33:50,670
I’ve tried,

2052
01:33:50,670 --> 01:33:52,460
but haven’t got solid information yet.

2053
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:53,750
Well,

2054
01:33:53,750 --> 01:33:55,130
if you can’t find the owner,

2055
01:33:55,130 --> 01:33:56,670
follow the money

2056
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:33,000
Nagaraj!

2057
01:34:33,590 --> 01:34:35,000
Isn’t it Nograj?

2058
01:34:35,250 --> 01:34:36,590
Is that important right now?

2059
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:39,670
He controls the Water Mafia using his Water Tankers!

2060
01:34:39,670 --> 01:34:45,300
He shares the money along with other corporators
as well as party members.

2061
01:34:45,670 --> 01:34:47,500
We can bring this out in the public,

2062
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:48,880
but its dangerous.

2063
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:49,840
I understand!

2064
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:51,710
Let’s keep this information guarded.

2065
01:34:51,710 --> 01:34:53,630
And wait to see how and...

2066
01:34:53,630 --> 01:34:55,130
...when we can use this information against him.

2067
01:34:55,130 --> 01:34:56,420
Excuse me Sir! One minute sir!

2068
01:34:56,420 --> 01:34:57,210
Wait here.

2069
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:00,050
Pramod, Bellandur Lake definitely has Snow.

2070
01:35:00,550 --> 01:35:02,050
Monjunath, take it easy.

2071
01:35:02,380 --> 01:35:04,550
Arun Patil has dismissed...

2072
01:35:04,550 --> 01:35:06,460
...a Muslim man from his pharmaceutical company.

2073
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:10,420
How do you know Monjunath?

2074
01:35:10,420 --> 01:35:11,550
Contacts, sir!

2075
01:35:11,550 --> 01:35:12,750
What’s his appearance like?

2076
01:35:13,670 --> 01:35:14,800
He has a orange colour beard.

2077
01:35:18,300 --> 01:35:19,170
My god!

2078
01:35:19,550 --> 01:35:20,840
Orange is the new black!

2079
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:24,210
Sir, we have to do something with this information.

2080
01:35:24,630 --> 01:35:26,960
Sir, this week, there is the Bakri-Eid festival.

2081
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:34,670
Monjunath!

2082
01:35:34,670 --> 01:35:36,300
Do I look like a Muslim man?

2083
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:37,250
Small change will help Sir.

2084
01:35:37,250 --> 01:35:38,090
What’s the small change?

2085
01:35:40,050 --> 01:35:41,130
Monjunath!

2086
01:35:42,090 --> 01:35:42,960
Come, take this.

2087
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:43,920
Okay sir.

2088
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:45,670
Donate with all your heart.

2089
01:35:45,670 --> 01:35:47,380
Speaking about heart,

2090
01:35:47,380 --> 01:35:51,630
Today, we have with us a precious member of our constituency.

2091
01:35:51,630 --> 01:35:53,630
Don’t say that Azam…

2092
01:35:53,630 --> 01:35:56,340
Someone who has brought light to our community…

2093
01:35:56,340 --> 01:35:56,800
Add humble.

2094
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:57,380
Please add humble.

2095
01:35:57,380 --> 01:35:59,460
I’m saying it, let me say it, be patient…

2096
01:36:00,380 --> 01:36:01,960
Our humble corporator

2097
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:04,590
who is running to become our MLA…

2098
01:36:04,590 --> 01:36:08,210
I request him to say a few words to this peaceful gathering.

2099
01:36:08,550 --> 01:36:09,460
What, Azam Khan!

2100
01:36:09,460 --> 01:36:10,750
Nograj Sir!

2101
01:36:10,750 --> 01:36:12,750
Please let’s welcome him with applause.

2102
01:36:12,750 --> 01:36:13,920
Please clap!

2103
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:19,460
Greetings to all my dear friends!

2104
01:36:19,460 --> 01:36:21,090
From the bottom of my heart,

2105
01:36:21,090 --> 01:36:22,750
A very happy Bakri-Eid to all of you.

2106
01:36:23,420 --> 01:36:25,630
My name is Nograj.

2107
01:36:27,250 --> 01:36:28,920
I am a...

2108
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:31,340
...humble politician.

2109
01:36:31,340 --> 01:36:35,170
I am here because...

2110
01:36:35,170 --> 01:36:36,840
...elections are around the corner.

2111
01:36:37,250 --> 01:36:38,380
Arun Patil..

2112
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:41,090
...has studied abroad.

2113
01:36:41,090 --> 01:36:43,000
That’s why he has...

2114
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,090
...the western influence.

2115
01:36:45,090 --> 01:36:47,210
Western media is labelling...

2116
01:36:47,210 --> 01:36:49,050
...the Muslims...

2117
01:36:50,250 --> 01:36:51,420
...as terrorists.

2118
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:55,920
I am not saying this.

2119
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:57,420
They are saying this.

2120
01:36:57,420 --> 01:36:59,590
Because of these circumstances,

2121
01:36:59,590 --> 01:37:02,250
there is no place for Muslims abroad.

2122
01:37:02,250 --> 01:37:05,250
Arun Patil has taken advantage of this ..

2123
01:37:05,250 --> 01:37:07,050
and fired one of our Muslim brothers.

2124
01:37:07,050 --> 01:37:08,050
Basheer.

2125
01:37:08,050 --> 01:37:09,920
Why has he done that?

2126
01:37:11,090 --> 01:37:13,210
Because, Basheer has a beard.

2127
01:37:14,050 --> 01:37:15,630
Carrot colour beard.

2128
01:37:15,630 --> 01:37:18,170
According to me, we are all brothers.

2129
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:21,380
Azam, have we ever fought in our relationship?

2130
01:37:21,380 --> 01:37:22,250
No sir…No sir…

2131
01:37:22,250 --> 01:37:22,920
We haven’t!

2132
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:24,000
Yes, we haven’t!

2133
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,050
Look, I love Muslims.

2134
01:37:26,050 --> 01:37:27,590
You can and should do whatever you want to do.

2135
01:37:28,460 --> 01:37:29,920
You want to wear a cap...

2136
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:31,460
Or sport a beard...

2137
01:37:31,460 --> 01:37:32,210
Do a goat..

2138
01:37:32,210 --> 01:37:33,170
Wear a veil...

2139
01:37:33,170 --> 01:37:34,090
Do whatever you want!

2140
01:37:34,090 --> 01:37:36,300
I will help Basheer,

2141
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:41,250
but in turn you will have to do something for me.

2142
01:37:43,250 --> 01:37:45,920
Please vote for me in the upcoming elections.

2143
01:37:46,460 --> 01:37:50,340
Together, we can make India shine bright

2144
01:37:54,420 --> 01:37:55,750
I love Eid !

2145
01:37:56,300 --> 01:37:57,630
I love Muslims!

2146
01:37:58,250 --> 01:37:59,340
I love Biriyani!

2147
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,460
Bismillah!

2148
01:38:04,460 --> 01:38:06,420
You have to say Allah Hafiz, not Bismillah.

2149
01:38:06,420 --> 01:38:08,130
Allah Hafiz!

2150
01:38:10,590 --> 01:38:11,500
Greetings!

2151
01:38:15,340 --> 01:38:16,420
Amjad!

2152
01:38:16,420 --> 01:38:18,130
Sir… Basheer!

2153
01:38:20,550 --> 01:38:22,210
So, Basheer!

2154
01:38:22,210 --> 01:38:26,500
That Arun Patil….with you… uh…that…

2155
01:38:27,710 --> 01:38:29,340
Do you speak Kannada?

2156
01:38:29,340 --> 01:38:30,630
Yes, I do.

2157
01:38:30,630 --> 01:38:31,590
Thank God!

2158
01:38:32,250 --> 01:38:33,960
When I heard what Arun Patil did to you,

2159
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:36,130
it really upset me.

2160
01:38:36,750 --> 01:38:40,590
An incident of this nature takes away the secularity from our country.

2161
01:38:41,250 --> 01:38:42,130
Correct?

2162
01:38:42,130 --> 01:38:45,130
Sir, I sold pharma supplies in the black market, that’s why I was fired.

2163
01:38:45,130 --> 01:38:46,920
What is wrong with you?

2164
01:38:48,500 --> 01:38:50,550
Come here

2165
01:38:50,550 --> 01:38:52,840
Have you said this in the Media?

2166
01:38:52,840 --> 01:38:53,590
No Sir.

2167
01:38:53,630 --> 01:38:54,630
Okay,

2168
01:38:54,630 --> 01:38:56,090
I will arrange for you to talk with the Press.

2169
01:38:56,090 --> 01:38:57,000
Monjunath,

2170
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:57,460
sir..

2171
01:38:58,840 --> 01:39:00,960
give him some money.

2172
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:04,210
Basheer, you please tell the Media that...

2173
01:39:04,210 --> 01:39:07,090
...Arun Patil dismissed you from the job,

2174
01:39:07,090 --> 01:39:09,500
because of your religion.

2175
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:11,960
If they ask you anything about my involvement,

2176
01:39:12,590 --> 01:39:13,300
don’t say anything.

2177
01:39:13,300 --> 01:39:15,340
Sir, but how can I do this?

2178
01:39:16,380 --> 01:39:19,210
Now, you want to talk?

2179
01:39:19,210 --> 01:39:20,300
No sir, Please!

2180
01:39:20,300 --> 01:39:22,880
Media is here, Police is with me.

2181
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:24,960
I’ll tell them all, that you’ve stolen.

2182
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:26,090
After they will come

2183
01:39:26,090 --> 01:39:29,460
Your family will be dragged in.

2184
01:39:29,460 --> 01:39:31,630
They’ll call you a robber.
I’ll make sure you are humiliated.

2185
01:39:31,630 --> 01:39:33,250
You want that?

2186
01:39:34,710 --> 01:39:35,840
Be smart. Take care, okay?

2187
01:39:37,250 --> 01:39:38,840
Basheer, use your brains,

2188
01:39:38,840 --> 01:39:40,050
come with me.

2189
01:39:40,050 --> 01:39:42,550
Arun Patil fired me from the job,

2190
01:39:42,550 --> 01:39:45,880
because of my appearance and that I’m a Muslim.

2191
01:39:47,710 --> 01:39:50,920
Yes, we shall answer all your questions in the Press Meet.

2192
01:39:50,920 --> 01:39:51,960
Hold on!

2193
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:54,000
I’ll call you back…

2194
01:39:54,750 --> 01:39:55,920
Let’s not do it,

2195
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:58,250
let’s not handle this politically.

2196
01:39:59,300 --> 01:40:00,800
Cancel the press conference!

2197
01:40:01,710 --> 01:40:04,590
(music)

2198
01:40:09,380 --> 01:40:10,590
Nagu,

2199
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:13,670
Nogu, we have to go for Chandu’s movie premiere.

2200
01:40:14,250 --> 01:40:17,090
Okay, we’ll go! What is there, Lavanya!

2201
01:40:18,300 --> 01:40:20,550
(Phone rings)

2202
01:40:20,550 --> 01:40:21,750
Azam Khan’s call….Answer…

2203
01:40:23,210 --> 01:40:24,590
Greetings, Azam Khan!

2204
01:40:24,590 --> 01:40:25,500
Nograj Sir,

2205
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:27,670
Arun Patil called and met Basheer.

2206
01:40:27,670 --> 01:40:30,130
I don’t know what he said to Basheer,
but situation has got out of hand.

2207
01:40:30,460 --> 01:40:32,630
Basheer, you have two options!

2208
01:40:32,630 --> 01:40:36,630
Either you fight me in the court with the money that Nograj has given you…

2209
01:40:36,630 --> 01:40:39,090
…Or tell people what really happened!

2210
01:40:39,090 --> 01:40:41,460
Sir, I didn't go against you.

2211
01:40:41,460 --> 01:40:43,090
Nograj forced me.

2212
01:40:43,590 --> 01:40:45,500
Okay, you move to a new place,

2213
01:40:45,500 --> 01:40:47,050
I’ll get you a new job.

2214
01:40:47,050 --> 01:40:47,750
Okay.

2215
01:40:47,750 --> 01:40:49,670
Basheer has vanished.

2216
01:40:49,670 --> 01:40:51,840
Riyaz, go and look for him, I say!

2217
01:40:58,880 --> 01:41:04,920
Put it, put it, put it…

2218
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:06,130
Monjunath what do you mean, put?

2219
01:41:06,130 --> 01:41:07,250
That Sir….

2220
01:41:07,250 --> 01:41:08,050
what do you mean, put?

2221
01:41:08,050 --> 01:41:09,920
Tell them to cast their votes,

2222
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:11,380
We already have a huge population problem.

2223
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:15,710
We had to pay 2 lakh rupees for 1 hut,

2224
01:41:15,710 --> 01:41:18,300
and in spite of that every month we have to pay for water and electricity.

2225
01:41:18,300 --> 01:41:20,800
I will try my best to help you guys.

2226
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:24,130
Under my company’s corporate social responsibility…

2227
01:41:24,130 --> 01:41:27,300
I can allocate some funds and help your slum.

2228
01:41:27,300 --> 01:41:28,960
Living conditions are tough,

2229
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:31,420
our home is too small.

2230
01:41:31,420 --> 01:41:32,880
Oh, your home is too small, is it?

2231
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:34,170
Do one thing,

2232
01:41:34,170 --> 01:41:35,250
Give us your homes.

2233
01:41:35,250 --> 01:41:37,050
We will build a flyover.

2234
01:41:37,050 --> 01:41:38,750
You can sleep under the flyover.

2235
01:41:38,750 --> 01:41:40,210
You’ll have great ventilation,

2236
01:41:40,210 --> 01:41:41,800
and a rooftop garden also.

2237
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:44,340
(phone rings)

2238
01:41:44,340 --> 01:41:45,670
Hello, Rakshit Shetty!

2239
01:41:45,670 --> 01:41:46,340
Greetings!

2240
01:41:46,340 --> 01:41:47,460
No, nothing.

2241
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:49,670
Can I produce your next film?

2242
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:53,840
Nothing much.

2243
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:54,880
Just chilling in the slums.

2244
01:41:56,340 --> 01:41:58,130
You know how poor people are! Always complaining!

2245
01:42:01,130 --> 01:42:02,880
MLA candidate, Nograj Sir.

2246
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:03,960
You have to vote for him!

2247
01:42:08,670 --> 01:42:09,630
Sir, sir, sir!

2248
01:42:09,630 --> 01:42:11,250
Nograj sir is standing for MLA election.

2249
01:42:11,250 --> 01:42:12,880
Amma,

2250
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:14,300
vote for me.

2251
01:42:14,300 --> 01:42:16,550
please vote for me.

2252
01:42:21,590 --> 01:42:22,710
Greetings!

2253
01:42:22,710 --> 01:42:23,630
Please take it.

2254
01:42:24,340 --> 01:42:25,340
Please.

2255
01:42:26,630 --> 01:42:27,300
Thank you Bhaskar

2256
01:42:27,300 --> 01:42:28,130
It is my duty.

2257
01:42:28,130 --> 01:42:29,090
I appreciate it!

2258
01:42:29,710 --> 01:42:31,880
He has dug borewells,

2259
01:42:31,880 --> 01:42:35,380
and provides free water as part of community service

2260
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:40,920
Ward no. 199. You have to vote for Sir…

2261
01:42:40,920 --> 01:42:42,630
You will get everything!

2262
01:42:42,630 --> 01:42:44,000
Slum Lady!

2263
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:46,090
Cleaning lady!

2264
01:42:50,500 --> 01:42:51,800
Sir….

2265
01:42:51,800 --> 01:42:53,090
No sir...

2266
01:42:57,090 --> 01:42:58,500
You have to vote for me.

2267
01:42:58,500 --> 01:43:00,300
Promise,

2268
01:43:00,300 --> 01:43:02,000
Promise, yeah!....that’s the way to do it, yeah!

2269
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,090
Thumbs up! Cheers!

2270
01:43:03,090 --> 01:43:04,170
Mother,

2271
01:43:04,170 --> 01:43:06,050
I am your Humble Politician Nograj!

2272
01:43:06,380 --> 01:43:09,000
Please make me your Humble MLA Nograj.

2273
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:10,670
Sir, sir, no! Sir!

2274
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:19,420
Slum lady!

2275
01:43:28,210 --> 01:43:30,920
In this film, I’ve done a lot of method acting.

2276
01:43:30,920 --> 01:43:34,500
The film deals with how love is the slow poison.

2277
01:43:34,500 --> 01:43:36,500
To prepare for the role..

2278
01:43:36,500 --> 01:43:38,380
There was a lot of pain inside me,

2279
01:43:39,630 --> 01:43:41,250
and I had to bring that pain out.

2280
01:43:41,250 --> 01:43:42,880
The pain became poison…

2281
01:43:43,210 --> 01:43:43,750
Chandu!

2282
01:43:44,630 --> 01:43:46,800
Oh! My godfather is here…

2283
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:47,550
Come here…

2284
01:43:48,840 --> 01:43:49,800
Greetings, dear sir!

2285
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:50,960
Oh my god!

2286
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:52,340
You’ve become a hero.

2287
01:43:52,340 --> 01:43:54,380
What a horror hairstyle this is!

2288
01:43:54,380 --> 01:43:56,090
Droha is the name of your film, right?

2289
01:43:56,090 --> 01:43:57,340
Let’s watch it!
Sure Sir!

2290
01:43:57,340 --> 01:43:59,300
Pramod, don't forget to take his autograph!

2291
01:44:06,420 --> 01:44:07,840
Myna!

2292
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:09,340
You have betrayed my trust.

2293
01:44:09,340 --> 01:44:10,050
I have proof.

2294
01:44:10,050 --> 01:44:10,960
Look here!

2295
01:44:12,500 --> 01:44:16,000
I can't believe you've done this to me.

2296
01:44:16,210 --> 01:44:18,800
I've taken you where ever you've wanted to go.

2297
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:20,000
Monjunath!

2298
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:21,210
Sorry dear friends…

2299
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:25,170
Monjunath, Rascal!

2300
01:44:25,960 --> 01:44:26,590
Come here.

2301
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:28,550
Lavanya, baby…

2302
01:44:28,550 --> 01:44:29,210
Yes..

2303
01:44:29,210 --> 01:44:30,130
Do you want to eat anything?

2304
01:44:30,130 --> 01:44:31,460
Yes…

2305
01:44:31,460 --> 01:44:35,920
1 caramel popcorn, 1 nachos, and 1 cold drink.

2306
01:44:35,920 --> 01:44:36,420
Okay.

2307
01:44:36,420 --> 01:44:37,300
Give me the money.

2308
01:44:41,800 --> 01:44:42,880
Here...

2309
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:45,210
Excuse me,

2310
01:44:45,210 --> 01:44:48,880
1 caramel popcorn, 1 nachos, 1 Coke…

2311
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:49,710
What?

2312
01:44:51,670 --> 01:44:53,130
Listen, I am a politician...

2313
01:44:53,130 --> 01:44:54,800
You wanna argue with me?

2314
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:55,750
Go and get this!

2315
01:45:04,250 --> 01:45:05,000
Monjunath…

2316
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:05,550
Sir?

2317
01:45:05,550 --> 01:45:07,710
This film has given me a wonderful idea.

2318
01:45:07,710 --> 01:45:10,050
Arun Patil, his wife and his daughter;

2319
01:45:10,050 --> 01:45:11,460
put surveillance on them and...

2320
01:45:11,460 --> 01:45:13,630
...see if you can get some controversy out of it.

2321
01:45:13,630 --> 01:45:14,710
Okay sir.

2322
01:45:14,710 --> 01:45:16,920
Don’t be so loud Monjunath.

2323
01:45:18,460 --> 01:45:19,500
Sir,

2324
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:20,090
popcorn!

2325
01:45:20,090 --> 01:45:21,710
Yeah, thank you.

2326
01:45:23,590 --> 01:45:24,960
Sir, my seat?

2327
01:45:27,340 --> 01:45:30,090
Never ever talk to a politician about his seat.

2328
01:45:30,550 --> 01:45:32,380
Once we take a seat,

2329
01:45:32,380 --> 01:45:33,800
we never give it up.

2330
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:37,420
By the way, where is my change?

2331
01:45:42,050 --> 01:45:43,710
What an unbelievable movie monjunath!

2332
01:45:43,710 --> 01:45:44,670
Yes, sir.

2333
01:45:47,710 --> 01:45:51,460
Lake revival, road widening, safety in high-rise buildings and...

2334
01:45:51,460 --> 01:45:54,210
Entry & exit requirements for emergency vehicles...

2335
01:45:54,210 --> 01:45:56,300
We need to plan and discuss about all these!

2336
01:45:57,300 --> 01:45:58,000
Let’s go…

2337
01:45:58,000 --> 01:45:59,000
Where?

2338
01:46:00,630 --> 01:46:02,000
Just give me a minute…

2339
01:46:03,590 --> 01:46:04,050
Yeah?

2340
01:46:04,050 --> 01:46:06,050
How many days has it been since we last went out?

2341
01:46:06,050 --> 01:46:07,800
I have a meeting with the authorities at the Municipal Corporation.

2342
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:09,090
When?

2343
01:46:09,090 --> 01:46:09,800
Tomorrow.

2344
01:46:09,800 --> 01:46:10,710
Tomorrow, right?

2345
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:12,420
Spend some time with Nivvi today.

2346
01:46:12,420 --> 01:46:13,710
I’ll see you outside in 10 minutes.

2347
01:46:22,460 --> 01:46:24,090
Daddy, please hand me your mobile!

2348
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:26,750
Here...

2349
01:46:46,050 --> 01:46:48,090
Watch closely, dear media friends!

2350
01:46:49,420 --> 01:46:53,170
These visuals are very scary.

2351
01:46:54,130 --> 01:46:56,800
In this video, the guilty party is Arun Patil!

2352
01:46:57,380 --> 01:47:00,130
Ladies, I’ll ask you this.

2353
01:47:00,130 --> 01:47:02,300
If I force you and try to remove your clothes?

2354
01:47:02,300 --> 01:47:02,960
Sir...sir!

2355
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:04,130
I won’t do it Monjunath! I

2356
01:47:04,130 --> 01:47:04,840
I won’t do it

2357
01:47:04,840 --> 01:47:07,210
Because I am not Arun Patil.

2358
01:47:07,210 --> 01:47:08,960
What he has done and...

2359
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:11,130
...is doing is against our Indian culture!

2360
01:47:11,630 --> 01:47:13,750
Going after the ladies in such a manner.

2361
01:47:14,920 --> 01:47:18,920
Let me make it clear that the upcoming elections
and this issue have no connection whatsover.

2362
01:47:19,880 --> 01:47:24,090
But I am concerned about the safety of our women.

2363
01:47:24,750 --> 01:47:27,880
Madam, say you’re working in a software company.

2364
01:47:27,880 --> 01:47:30,750
After finishing your work, you book a cab.

2365
01:47:30,750 --> 01:47:32,920
You open the door of the cab and see...

2366
01:47:33,250 --> 01:47:34,130
Who is the driver?

2367
01:47:35,250 --> 01:47:37,000
Its Arun Patil!

2368
01:47:39,460 --> 01:47:41,750
Madam, say you’re jogging in our Cubbon Park.

2369
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:44,460
You are jogging.

2370
01:47:44,460 --> 01:47:45,800
Suddenly, you start running.

2371
01:47:45,800 --> 01:47:46,380
Why?

2372
01:47:46,380 --> 01:47:48,550
Because someone is running behind you!

2373
01:47:48,550 --> 01:47:50,340
And that is…Arun Patil!

2374
01:47:56,920 --> 01:47:57,920
Roopa Madam!

2375
01:47:58,840 --> 01:47:59,800
Christmas.

2376
01:48:00,170 --> 01:48:02,960
A man, wearing nice red colour clothes,

2377
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:06,050
carrying a bag, stands outside your house door.

2378
01:48:07,090 --> 01:48:07,960
He rings the bell.

2379
01:48:07,960 --> 01:48:09,500
You open the door,

2380
01:48:10,300 --> 01:48:11,590
who do you see?

2381
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:13,710
Arun Patil?

2382
01:48:13,710 --> 01:48:14,670
No!

2383
01:48:15,050 --> 01:48:16,460
That’s Santa Claus!

2384
01:48:17,420 --> 01:48:20,300
Please, don’t mix religion with this issue.

2385
01:48:20,300 --> 01:48:21,920
Please, I’m saying this again,

2386
01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:26,210
Let’s not entertain these sex-hungry NRIs.

2387
01:48:26,210 --> 01:48:28,340
But, in this video,

2388
01:48:28,340 --> 01:48:29,670
the women...

2389
01:48:29,670 --> 01:48:32,380
...are walking backwards?

2390
01:48:32,380 --> 01:48:33,550
Of course!

2391
01:48:33,550 --> 01:48:36,500
Madam, if Arun Patil comes towards you,

2392
01:48:36,500 --> 01:48:38,210
will you go forward or backward?

2393
01:48:38,920 --> 01:48:40,920
That’s why people are going backward!

2394
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:42,170
Please don’t ask such stupid questions!

2395
01:48:42,170 --> 01:48:43,130
Sir...Sir… One more question… Sir!

2396
01:48:43,130 --> 01:48:43,800
No, no photo, no question!

2397
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:44,630
Please Sir…

2398
01:48:50,090 --> 01:48:52,550
MLA Candidate Arun Patil was found behaving

2399
01:48:52,550 --> 01:48:57,210
Inappropriately with women in a public place.

2400
01:48:57,210 --> 01:49:00,920
Will this affect the result of the upcoming MLA Election?

2401
01:49:00,920 --> 01:49:02,750
I filmed this.

2402
01:49:04,210 --> 01:49:07,170
Did you see the sex video of MLA candidate Arun Patil?

2403
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:09,170
Which sex video, sir?

2404
01:49:09,630 --> 01:49:10,920
Voting day isn’t too far.

2405
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:12,960
What is the status on our campaign promotions in colleges, Prashant?

2406
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:14,210
There is awareness.

2407
01:49:14,210 --> 01:49:15,340
We are pushing as much as we possibly can,

2408
01:49:15,340 --> 01:49:18,090
so that we have
support from youngsters on the voting day.

2409
01:49:18,090 --> 01:49:19,000
That’s good.

2410
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,170
Sir, we wanted to talk about…

2411
01:49:21,300 --> 01:49:21,920
Yeah?

2412
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:24,250
We feel, you should release a press statement about the Video…

2413
01:49:24,250 --> 01:49:27,210
It can be done. But we have other things to do right?

2414
01:49:27,210 --> 01:49:28,550
Let’s focus on that.

2415
01:49:29,750 --> 01:49:30,920
Ridiculous!

2416
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:43,170
I told you I was busy,

2417
01:49:43,170 --> 01:49:44,460
but you had to take me out shopping!

2418
01:49:45,130 --> 01:49:45,920
Nothing has happened!

2419
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:47,920
Really? I mean, I know this is silly,

2420
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:49,090
but just before election day…

2421
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:52,050
This isn’t good for me or for the campaign.

2422
01:49:52,050 --> 01:49:53,340
What will people think and say?

2423
01:49:54,460 --> 01:49:55,420
Which people?

2424
01:49:55,420 --> 01:49:57,380
Rama, I have worked hard so far!

2425
01:49:57,380 --> 01:49:59,920
My image, my reputation,

2426
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:00,800
my name…

2427
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:04,250
Sorry…

2428
01:50:04,250 --> 01:50:07,380
If this continues, people will not take me seriously…

2429
01:50:07,380 --> 01:50:09,130
Who wont take you seriously?

2430
01:50:11,050 --> 01:50:12,130
And, after watching that video?

2431
01:50:12,130 --> 01:50:15,000
Nograj can maybe fool a few people with this video.

2432
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,800
Tomorrow, he will comment on your lifestyle.

2433
01:50:17,800 --> 01:50:19,210
They will say,

2434
01:50:19,630 --> 01:50:21,460
It was wrong for you to party and have fun in college!

2435
01:50:22,550 --> 01:50:23,960
What will you do then?

2436
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:39,590
What a beauty night this is!

2437
01:50:39,630 --> 01:50:41,340
I will rob,

2438
01:50:41,340 --> 01:50:42,340
I will scam

2439
01:50:42,340 --> 01:50:45,840
and give you a kiss!

2440
01:50:47,710 --> 01:50:49,130
Call that Nograj!

2441
01:50:53,630 --> 01:50:54,300
Prakash…

2442
01:50:54,300 --> 01:50:54,880
Sir?

2443
01:50:54,880 --> 01:50:57,960
Tell everyone in your ward to vote for Nograj Sir!

2444
01:50:57,960 --> 01:50:59,250
It’ll be done, don’t worry.
Per vote,

2445
01:50:59,250 --> 01:51:01,630
it’ll cost you 1000 Rs.

2446
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:02,800
Okay, let’s Rs. 500 per vote…

2447
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:03,670
That wont work Sir.

2448
01:51:03,670 --> 01:51:07,250
Hey, come on, with 500 Rs, they will get a cycle or a Television…

2449
01:51:07,880 --> 01:51:08,840
Hello!

2450
01:51:10,670 --> 01:51:13,050
Yeah, yeah, call me, no problem.

2451
01:51:13,050 --> 01:51:14,300
I will definitely come.

2452
01:51:14,300 --> 01:51:15,550
Yeah, bye, yeah!

2453
01:51:16,130 --> 01:51:16,960
Lavanya!

2454
01:51:17,710 --> 01:51:19,840
Swimming pool also you are wearing a saree.

2455
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:21,130
Following Indian culture.

2456
01:51:21,130 --> 01:51:23,210
So, Arun Patil called us to his home for dinner!

2457
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,130
He got scared by your campaigning skills.

2458
01:51:26,130 --> 01:51:27,960
You know me so well.

2459
01:51:27,960 --> 01:51:29,340
Arun Patil!

2460
01:51:29,340 --> 01:51:30,630
I’m coming.

2461
01:51:31,170 --> 01:51:33,960
Lavanya! Stop making me wet.

2462
01:51:37,130 --> 01:51:39,090
My god. Its Arun Patil.

2463
01:51:39,090 --> 01:51:40,420
Yeah…Yeah…

2464
01:51:40,420 --> 01:51:42,500
Yeah…Thanks for inviting us!

2465
01:51:42,500 --> 01:51:42,960
Yeah, sure.

2466
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:44,380
This is my wife,

2467
01:51:44,380 --> 01:51:46,000
Mrs. Nograj!

2468
01:51:47,130 --> 01:51:48,170
Say Namaste!

2469
01:51:48,170 --> 01:51:48,960
What is your name?

2470
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:50,880
Lavanya…
Mrs. Nograj! I’ve already told you!

2471
01:51:51,590 --> 01:51:52,460
Is this your wife?

2472
01:51:52,460 --> 01:51:53,920
Yeah, this is Rama!

2473
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:54,590
Greetings!

2474
01:51:54,590 --> 01:51:55,960
Greetings! Sister, I’ve seen all your videos.

2475
01:51:55,960 --> 01:51:57,050
Yes, very nice video!
Sir?

2476
01:51:57,050 --> 01:51:58,000
Lucida Grande

2477
01:52:00,250 --> 01:52:01,880
So…okay, let’s party!

2478
01:52:01,880 --> 01:52:02,880
Let’s party now, come on!

2479
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:04,210
Yeah!

2480
01:52:05,130 --> 01:52:05,800
Monjunath, come!

2481
01:52:05,800 --> 01:52:06,550
So, this is your house!

2482
01:52:06,550 --> 01:52:07,710
Your house is so small.

2483
01:52:07,710 --> 01:52:10,210
You can leave my hand! It’s okay, please come inside!

2484
01:52:12,670 --> 01:52:13,880
So Arun Patil,

2485
01:52:13,880 --> 01:52:17,630
The battle between us has been going on for many days now.

2486
01:52:17,630 --> 01:52:19,840
It is good to meet you in person Nograj!

2487
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:21,050
Yeah.

2488
01:52:21,050 --> 01:52:23,550
I haven't felt bad about the personal attacks.

2489
01:52:23,550 --> 01:52:26,840
Whatever you have said against me, is fine.

2490
01:52:26,840 --> 01:52:29,170
You have done that with me, haven’t you?

2491
01:52:29,170 --> 01:52:30,380
Look Arun Patil,

2492
01:52:30,380 --> 01:52:34,590
all these honest things that you are doing.

2493
01:52:34,590 --> 01:52:35,460
What is the reason behind it?

2494
01:52:35,460 --> 01:52:37,380
I really want to make a difference.

2495
01:52:37,380 --> 01:52:41,630
See, even if you want to work honestly, like me,

2496
01:52:41,630 --> 01:52:44,340
there are 200 people in the Parliament.

2497
01:52:44,340 --> 01:52:46,170
There is also the Union Government.

2498
01:52:46,170 --> 01:52:49,170
The higher up you go, the more dishonesty there is.

2499
01:52:50,090 --> 01:52:53,960
Single-handedly, no one can change the way our country functions.

2500
01:52:54,050 --> 01:52:54,710
No Nograj,

2501
01:52:54,710 --> 01:52:55,670
its possible.

2502
01:52:55,670 --> 01:52:57,380
I am trying

2503
01:52:57,880 --> 01:52:59,670
I am trying to plant a seed with my idea.

2504
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:01,750
Okay, why 1 seed?

2505
01:53:01,750 --> 01:53:03,250
I will give you lots of land.

2506
01:53:03,250 --> 01:53:04,920
You can plant 100 seeds.

2507
01:53:04,920 --> 01:53:08,250
We will call it the Arun Patil Forest Reserve.

2508
01:53:08,250 --> 01:53:12,090
Nograj, I very well know what you’re doing!

2509
01:53:12,090 --> 01:53:15,880
If you feel what you are doing is right, then continue doing that...

2510
01:53:15,880 --> 01:53:17,920
But I’m built differently.

2511
01:53:17,920 --> 01:53:21,380
My thoughts and ideologies are very different.

2512
01:53:21,380 --> 01:53:22,500
See Arun Patil,

2513
01:53:22,500 --> 01:53:24,550
this news,

2514
01:53:24,550 --> 01:53:25,300
pickle,

2515
01:53:25,300 --> 01:53:25,920
thoughts,

2516
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:26,800
zoology,

2517
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:27,800
biology,

2518
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:28,960
Balaji;

2519
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:31,090
I also know all these words. Okay?

2520
01:53:31,090 --> 01:53:35,300
In such an effective manner, I took Basheer and added a relgious angle...

2521
01:53:35,300 --> 01:53:37,750
...divided people,

2522
01:53:39,630 --> 01:53:40,800
but you ruined my plan there…

2523
01:53:41,340 --> 01:53:44,300
What Basheer did was because of need, not greed!

2524
01:53:45,090 --> 01:53:46,380
Sex..

2525
01:53:47,920 --> 01:53:49,550
Sex scandal!

2526
01:53:49,800 --> 01:53:50,500
Why did you do that?

2527
01:53:50,500 --> 01:53:52,670
It wasn’t a sex scandal, and you know that Nograj!

2528
01:53:52,670 --> 01:53:54,210
Of course,

2529
01:53:54,210 --> 01:53:58,590
does anyone behave like this with a woman in a public place?

2530
01:53:58,590 --> 01:54:01,170
It is against our Indian culture!

2531
01:54:01,170 --> 01:54:03,750
Everyone knows that you manipulated that video.

2532
01:54:04,340 --> 01:54:05,920
Okay,

2533
01:54:05,920 --> 01:54:07,420
electricity!

2534
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,840
I told people that I will cut myself,

2535
01:54:10,840 --> 01:54:12,590
I will go on a hunger strike.

2536
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,710
There also you distracted people with solar panels, kolar panels...⁠⁠⁠⁠

2537
01:54:15,710 --> 01:54:17,090
Something and all you've done...

2538
01:54:17,380 --> 01:54:19,130
It is not fair!

2539
01:54:22,050 --> 01:54:23,550
Look Nograj,

2540
01:54:23,550 --> 01:54:26,380
I’m not doing this to fight with you.

2541
01:54:26,380 --> 01:54:29,460
I’m doing all this to genuinely help people.

2542
01:54:31,130 --> 01:54:33,750
What he is saying is correct…

2543
01:54:33,750 --> 01:54:35,550
But, what should I say?

2544
01:54:37,880 --> 01:54:39,300
Should I punch him?

2545
01:54:40,050 --> 01:54:41,550
Wrong Thoughts!

2546
01:54:42,340 --> 01:54:43,340
Nograj!

2547
01:54:44,420 --> 01:54:45,090
Control!

2548
01:54:45,090 --> 01:54:46,840
He is such a pure person!

2549
01:54:46,840 --> 01:54:49,840
I really like talking to you, Arun Patil.

2550
01:54:52,420 --> 01:54:53,590
The feeling is mutual.

2551
01:54:57,920 --> 01:54:59,670
Why are you so silent?

2552
01:55:01,590 --> 01:55:03,460
Is he going to kiss me?

2553
01:55:04,630 --> 01:55:05,880
My god!

2554
01:55:06,210 --> 01:55:08,050
He is too cute.

2555
01:55:08,050 --> 01:55:09,340
Arun Patil,

2556
01:55:09,500 --> 01:55:10,920
say something…

2557
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:14,050
Nograj!

2558
01:55:14,750 --> 01:55:15,800
Hold my hands!

2559
01:55:15,800 --> 01:55:16,880
Come on, come on!

2560
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:19,250
It’s okay, give me your hands.

2561
01:55:21,670 --> 01:55:22,590
Close your eyes!

2562
01:55:24,090 --> 01:55:26,750
Nograj, what are you thinking of right this moment?

2563
01:55:26,750 --> 01:55:29,130
I am thinking,

2564
01:55:29,130 --> 01:55:30,800
why are your hands so soft

2565
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:34,090
and why am I holding your hands?

2566
01:55:34,090 --> 01:55:34,920
Okay,

2567
01:55:34,920 --> 01:55:37,460
Think of a place that is absolutely peace and happiness for you.

2568
01:55:37,460 --> 01:55:38,380
Okay.

2569
01:55:38,380 --> 01:55:40,420
The place with joy and happiness

2570
01:55:42,090 --> 01:55:42,670
Yeah!

2571
01:55:42,670 --> 01:55:43,670
Did you find that place?

2572
01:55:44,420 --> 01:55:45,050
Yeah!

2573
01:55:50,920 --> 01:55:52,630
I do solemnly swear,

2574
01:55:52,630 --> 01:55:58,300
that I will faithfully execute the Office of the President of the United States ...

2575
01:55:58,300 --> 01:56:00,960
and will do the best of my ...

2576
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:02,090
...disability,

2577
01:56:02,090 --> 01:56:05,000
damage, abandon and attack ...

2578
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:08,130
the constitution of the United States.

2579
01:56:08,420 --> 01:56:12,920
If this place makes you feel peaceful and happy,

2580
01:56:12,920 --> 01:56:15,050
then stay there,

2581
01:56:15,050 --> 01:56:16,840
but if not,

2582
01:56:16,840 --> 01:56:18,630
then you should change your goals.

2583
01:56:23,340 --> 01:56:25,130
Okay, you can open your eyes now!

2584
01:56:27,750 --> 01:56:28,380
Nograj!

2585
01:56:28,920 --> 01:56:31,920
Nograj! Hey, you okay?

2586
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:34,130
Arun Patil!

2587
01:56:34,130 --> 01:56:34,840
My god!

2588
01:56:35,210 --> 01:56:36,840
You are a genius!

2589
01:56:36,840 --> 01:56:38,420
What a magician you are?!

2590
01:56:38,550 --> 01:56:40,670
All this has made me too emotional.

2591
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:43,000
Where did you transport me?

2592
01:56:46,670 --> 01:56:48,920
Would you like to have some dessert?

2593
01:56:49,090 --> 01:56:51,800
Can anything be sweeter than him?

2594
01:56:51,800 --> 01:56:54,630
Yeah, yeah, do you have any Falooda?

2595
01:56:55,210 --> 01:56:56,500
Yeah, sure!

2596
01:56:56,670 --> 01:56:58,050
You have a nice house.

2597
01:56:58,050 --> 01:56:58,960
Thank you.

2598
01:56:58,960 --> 01:57:00,130
How much did it cost to make it?

2599
01:57:00,840 --> 01:57:03,210
Falooda, my favourite drink.

2600
01:57:04,880 --> 01:57:05,550
Yeah.

2601
01:57:11,460 --> 01:57:15,050
So, Arun, what are your hobbies?

2602
01:57:15,050 --> 01:57:16,210
I like to play Ping Pong!

2603
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:18,130
You know? Table tennis.

2604
01:57:18,130 --> 01:57:19,710
Yeah, yeah...the game that the Chinese play…

2605
01:57:19,710 --> 01:57:20,300
Yeah…

2606
01:57:20,300 --> 01:57:21,300
How about you?

2607
01:57:22,250 --> 01:57:23,630
Any sports?

2608
01:57:23,800 --> 01:57:25,380
Yeah…

2609
01:57:25,380 --> 01:57:26,630
Politics!

2610
01:57:26,630 --> 01:57:29,460
Politics…I love playing politics!

2611
01:57:29,460 --> 01:57:30,750
I really love it!

2612
01:57:31,550 --> 01:57:33,920
Have to say, you play it really well.

2613
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:40,090
No, its Falooda…

2614
01:57:46,050 --> 01:57:47,170
Look, Arun,

2615
01:57:47,170 --> 01:57:48,750
you are a very nice person.

2616
01:57:50,800 --> 01:57:53,090
The media keeps putting it out...

2617
01:57:53,090 --> 01:57:55,170
...there that politicians are always fighting.

2618
01:57:56,960 --> 01:57:59,050
We throw slippers at each other during the day in the Parliament,

2619
01:57:59,920 --> 01:58:01,210
but at night,

2620
01:58:01,210 --> 01:58:02,840
we sit and drink together.

2621
01:58:02,840 --> 01:58:04,000
What I’m trying to say is that

2622
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:05,340
we should always stay friends.

2623
01:58:05,340 --> 01:58:06,090
Okay?

2624
01:58:06,630 --> 01:58:10,300
Look, now our wives also are getting along so well with each other.

2625
01:58:10,300 --> 01:58:11,250
Lavanya!

2626
01:58:12,420 --> 01:58:13,420
What about you?

2627
01:58:13,420 --> 01:58:15,130
Do you have any kids?

2628
01:58:16,750 --> 01:58:19,090
No! I don’t like kids!

2629
01:58:20,630 --> 01:58:21,750
I don’t want...

2630
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:23,090
I don’t want...

2631
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:26,250
Our thoughts and ideas maybe different,

2632
01:58:26,250 --> 01:58:26,920
Yeah Yeah!

2633
01:58:26,920 --> 01:58:28,000
but deep down,

2634
01:58:28,380 --> 01:58:29,590
I know you’re not a bad person.

2635
01:58:30,130 --> 01:58:31,630
Not at all.

2636
01:58:32,630 --> 01:58:34,550
Look, based on,

2637
01:58:34,550 --> 01:58:35,710
caste,

2638
01:58:35,710 --> 01:58:36,670
creed,

2639
01:58:36,670 --> 01:58:37,710
color,

2640
01:58:37,710 --> 01:58:38,590
religion,

2641
01:58:38,590 --> 01:58:40,090
...I divide people.⁠⁠⁠⁠

2642
01:58:40,090 --> 01:58:43,590
But you, you are just getting people together.

2643
01:58:44,590 --> 01:58:45,710
I really….

2644
01:58:47,300 --> 01:58:48,380
Arun Patil,

2645
01:58:50,670 --> 01:58:52,130
I Love You!

2646
01:58:54,460 --> 01:58:55,340
Uh…

2647
01:58:57,420 --> 01:58:58,800
This was really good.

2648
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:00,250
Thank you for coming!

2649
01:59:00,250 --> 01:59:01,590
Yeah, yeah, come here!

2650
01:59:01,590 --> 01:59:02,500
What thanks for coming and all that!

2651
01:59:03,170 --> 01:59:05,960
What are your favourite movies?

2652
01:59:05,960 --> 01:59:08,630
Nograj, no need of getting so comfortable in the first meeting itself.

2653
01:59:08,630 --> 01:59:09,170
Sit there.

2654
01:59:09,170 --> 01:59:10,380
Okay, yeah!

2655
01:59:11,590 --> 01:59:13,250
But to answer your question,

2656
01:59:13,250 --> 01:59:14,210
my favourite movie is...

2657
01:59:14,210 --> 01:59:14,750
Titanic.

2658
01:59:14,750 --> 01:59:15,800
Oh! Why?

2659
01:59:15,800 --> 01:59:19,960
Our State should be able to withstand any iceberg,

2660
01:59:20,630 --> 01:59:23,710
but every time I think about Titanic…

2661
01:59:24,300 --> 01:59:25,670
I feel our state is sinking,

2662
01:59:26,750 --> 01:59:28,460
and we have to do something about it.

2663
01:59:28,460 --> 01:59:30,130
Yeah, yeah, whatever you say!?

2664
01:59:30,130 --> 01:59:31,420
Nograj, one more thing!

2665
01:59:31,420 --> 01:59:32,340
Yeah?

2666
01:59:32,750 --> 01:59:36,340
I know that you run the Water Mafia.

2667
01:59:37,170 --> 01:59:39,920
If I disclose this to the media,

2668
01:59:40,380 --> 01:59:41,630
you will lose your ticket.

2669
01:59:59,500 --> 02:00:02,960
Now you know how it feels to cry for water.

2670
02:00:03,500 --> 02:00:04,880
Arun Patil!

2671
02:00:05,750 --> 02:00:07,170
Please don’t do this.

2672
02:00:08,130 --> 02:00:11,300
I’ll refund everyone their money.

2673
02:00:11,300 --> 02:00:13,420
I will give free water to everyone.

2674
02:00:13,420 --> 02:00:15,000
Please Arun Patil!

2675
02:00:16,920 --> 02:00:19,750
If I want, I can also threaten you,

2676
02:00:20,420 --> 02:00:22,880
but I like you very much.

2677
02:00:24,170 --> 02:00:26,590
Please don’t to this, please!

2678
02:00:28,460 --> 02:00:30,050
It is okay. Don’t worry.

2679
02:00:30,050 --> 02:00:32,050
If you have played dirty against me,

2680
02:00:32,050 --> 02:00:34,090
doesn’t mean I’ll play dirty just to get back at you.

2681
02:00:34,090 --> 02:00:37,130
Every person gets a chance to make things right.

2682
02:00:37,300 --> 02:00:38,670
You can make amends as well.

2683
02:00:39,300 --> 02:00:40,210
Promise!

2684
02:00:40,210 --> 02:00:41,840
Pleasure meeting you!

2685
02:00:41,840 --> 02:00:43,380
Pleasure meeting you too.

2686
02:00:44,300 --> 02:00:45,500
Lavanya…

2687
02:00:45,500 --> 02:00:47,380
Let me call my wife!

2688
02:00:49,880 --> 02:00:51,880
Their house was too small, right?

2689
02:00:53,630 --> 02:00:55,420
Nagu, that….

2690
02:00:56,800 --> 02:00:59,000
My favourite movie is Titanic.

2691
02:01:16,670 --> 02:01:18,630
(phone rings)

2692
02:01:19,590 --> 02:01:20,420
Sir?

2693
02:01:21,090 --> 02:01:22,590
Sir, he is with me.

2694
02:01:23,300 --> 02:01:25,840
Will bring him to the office now Sir.

2695
02:01:32,250 --> 02:01:33,750
Who is going to win the election?

2696
02:01:33,750 --> 02:01:36,090
I think I’ll win…

2697
02:01:36,090 --> 02:01:37,420
You think?

2698
02:01:38,090 --> 02:01:38,670
Look at this…

2699
02:01:41,460 --> 02:01:42,460
Look Nograj,

2700
02:01:43,130 --> 02:01:44,840
if you don't win this election, moving forward,

2701
02:01:44,840 --> 02:01:46,340
forget party ticket,

2702
02:01:46,340 --> 02:01:48,250
I’ll make sure you won't get a movie ticket also…

2703
02:01:48,250 --> 02:01:52,500
In future, you won't be able to run for elections,
even as an independent candidate…

2704
02:01:52,500 --> 02:01:53,670
Just because,

2705
02:01:53,670 --> 02:01:57,050
I went for one dinner, you are yelling at me, Sir.

2706
02:01:58,250 --> 02:02:01,090
Arun Patil is a very honest man.

2707
02:02:01,090 --> 02:02:03,380
Anybody can fall in love with him, sir.

2708
02:02:03,380 --> 02:02:05,250
Not me, sir! Not me.

2709
02:02:05,250 --> 02:02:06,960
I am trying Sir!

2710
02:02:08,210 --> 02:02:10,130
Trying isn’t going to cut it.

2711
02:02:10,130 --> 02:02:12,420
Yes, in Politics,

2712
02:02:12,420 --> 02:02:14,590
number 2 position is useless.

2713
02:02:15,590 --> 02:02:18,460
What do you say Vice President Sir?

2714
02:02:28,170 --> 02:02:29,340
Arun Patil…

2715
02:02:32,630 --> 02:02:33,550
Sir!

2716
02:02:34,210 --> 02:02:35,050
Sir, please...

2717
02:02:35,050 --> 02:02:37,420
please come with me, sir!

2718
02:02:37,420 --> 02:02:39,920
Sir please sir…
Please come sir, please come…

2719
02:02:39,920 --> 02:02:40,800
Monjunath…

2720
02:02:40,800 --> 02:02:42,210
Please sir come…

2721
02:02:56,670 --> 02:02:59,420
Why have we come to the school, Monjunath?

2722
02:02:59,420 --> 02:03:01,170
Sir, please…

2723
02:03:05,210 --> 02:03:08,880
A for Apple,

2724
02:03:08,880 --> 02:03:12,460
B for Bhagyashree miss,

2725
02:03:12,460 --> 02:03:17,000
C for see-saw…

2726
02:03:17,130 --> 02:03:21,300
So when you all grow up, what do you all want to become?

2727
02:03:21,300 --> 02:03:22,420
You tell me…

2728
02:03:23,250 --> 02:03:25,460
I want to become a lift operator…

2729
02:03:28,090 --> 02:03:29,170
Okay okay…

2730
02:03:29,170 --> 02:03:30,130
Silence!

2731
02:03:30,670 --> 02:03:31,500
You tell me...

2732
02:03:31,500 --> 02:03:32,840
what do you want to become?

2733
02:03:32,840 --> 02:03:35,000
Miss, I want to become an housewife…

2734
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,300
She wants to have a career as a housewife it seems!

2735
02:03:37,300 --> 02:03:38,840
Silence!

2736
02:03:40,630 --> 02:03:41,800
You there, at the back…

2737
02:03:41,800 --> 02:03:44,710
Making all that noise.

2738
02:03:44,710 --> 02:03:48,000
You tell everybody, what do you want to become?

2739
02:03:48,340 --> 02:03:50,750
Miss, what's your salary?

2740
02:03:50,750 --> 02:03:52,050
What?

2741
02:03:52,420 --> 02:03:53,960
You're a teacher right?

2742
02:03:53,960 --> 02:03:54,800
What's your salary?

2743
02:03:56,840 --> 02:03:59,500
About 7000 rupees a month..

2744
02:04:03,420 --> 02:04:05,590
Even I want to make the same amount of money,

2745
02:04:05,590 --> 02:04:08,550
but not per month, per minute.

2746
02:04:09,210 --> 02:04:11,800
Now you tell me,

2747
02:04:11,800 --> 02:04:14,380
what do I want to become?

2748
02:04:29,750 --> 02:04:31,000
Sir...

2749
02:04:31,880 --> 02:04:34,250
sir, from the time I know you,

2750
02:04:34,250 --> 02:04:35,670
everything is easy for you…

2751
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:39,250
Whenever there is a problem, you solve it by doing a scam…

2752
02:04:40,300 --> 02:04:44,130
If you grow, then we grow…

2753
02:04:45,500 --> 02:04:48,670
Sir, what is my age? Tell me sir...

2754
02:04:49,300 --> 02:04:51,210
41 years!

2755
02:04:51,210 --> 02:04:52,380
Still single!

2756
02:04:53,420 --> 02:04:54,210
Why?

2757
02:04:59,750 --> 02:05:00,840
Monjunath!

2758
02:05:00,840 --> 02:05:01,130
Sir?

2759
02:05:01,130 --> 02:05:02,710
I need you now!

2760
02:05:02,710 --> 02:05:04,630
Sir, please let me finish the marriage ceremony…

2761
02:05:07,670 --> 02:05:09,590
Sir just a minute… Let me get married sir, please..

2762
02:05:11,460 --> 02:05:12,920
Sir, please understand sir…

2763
02:05:13,170 --> 02:05:15,550
Manju...

2764
02:05:16,340 --> 02:05:18,050
Leave the past sir.

2765
02:05:18,050 --> 02:05:20,050
If you give up like this, what about us?

2766
02:05:20,420 --> 02:05:21,380
Tell us sir?

2767
02:05:21,380 --> 02:05:22,800
Our life depends on you...

2768
02:05:23,500 --> 02:05:25,550
Sir, Show confidence!

2769
02:05:26,670 --> 02:05:28,500
Fight yourself, beat himself,

2770
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:30,420
don’t give up on myself!

2771
02:05:30,420 --> 02:05:32,130
Monjunath, it is not myself,

2772
02:05:32,130 --> 02:05:33,250
it is a I-self.

2773
02:05:33,750 --> 02:05:34,670
You listen to me Sir.

2774
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,840
Sir, you see things differently,

2775
02:05:38,840 --> 02:05:40,090
you do things differently.

2776
02:05:41,500 --> 02:05:43,250
People can do anything to you…

2777
02:05:43,250 --> 02:05:44,050
For…

2778
02:05:44,050 --> 02:05:45,250
I know sir…

2779
02:05:45,250 --> 02:05:46,460
I am saying

2780
02:05:46,460 --> 02:05:48,130
There is no one like you.

2781
02:05:48,130 --> 02:05:49,880
There is no one like Nograj sir!

2782
02:05:51,800 --> 02:05:53,630
There is no one like me sir!

2783
02:05:54,630 --> 02:05:55,750
Do you want to join the party?

2784
02:05:56,210 --> 02:05:56,840
Yes.

2785
02:05:57,250 --> 02:05:58,210
Where is the money?

2786
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:04,960
Nagu..what are you doing?

2787
02:06:04,960 --> 02:06:06,500
Don’t ask stupid questions!

2788
02:06:06,500 --> 02:06:08,170
I am not doing bungee jumping here.

2789
02:06:08,170 --> 02:06:09,750
I'm committing self-suicide

2790
02:06:09,750 --> 02:06:11,460
Nagu, I am coming up there…

2791
02:06:11,460 --> 02:06:13,130
No, you don’t come up,

2792
02:06:13,130 --> 02:06:15,250
If you come up, I’ll go up to heaven...

2793
02:06:16,250 --> 02:06:17,090
Because...

2794
02:06:17,090 --> 02:06:18,170
…you’re not marrying me.

2795
02:06:18,840 --> 02:06:19,750
So…

2796
02:06:21,050 --> 02:06:23,250
Nagu, you want to marry me?

2797
02:06:23,250 --> 02:06:25,090
Of course!

2798
02:06:25,210 --> 02:06:28,800
But please let me die because your rich father

2799
02:06:28,800 --> 02:06:31,130
will never let us get married,

2800
02:06:31,130 --> 02:06:31,920
that’s why I am…

2801
02:06:31,920 --> 02:06:32,840
No, no Nagu…

2802
02:06:32,840 --> 02:06:34,300
I will convince my father!

2803
02:06:34,800 --> 02:06:35,500
Please Nagu!

2804
02:06:35,500 --> 02:06:36,500
Please Listen to me!

2805
02:06:38,920 --> 02:06:40,710
I love you Nagu!

2806
02:06:45,340 --> 02:06:47,420
I…I…

2807
02:06:49,630 --> 02:06:51,550
...You love me too!

2808
02:06:53,380 --> 02:06:54,920
Lavanya loves me!

2809
02:06:54,920 --> 02:06:56,050
Thank you Lavanya.

2810
02:06:56,050 --> 02:06:58,000
I want to say to the College,

2811
02:06:58,000 --> 02:06:59,550
to the mountains…

2812
02:06:59,880 --> 02:07:01,050
Lavanya...

2813
02:07:01,050 --> 02:07:02,090
...loves me,

2814
02:07:02,880 --> 02:07:05,170
Lavanya wants to marry me,

2815
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:07,090
Lavanya...

2816
02:07:07,090 --> 02:07:11,170
...will give me money to become a politician!

2817
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:17,920
Yay!

2818
02:07:19,710 --> 02:07:20,670
Monjunath.

2819
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:21,550
Sir?

2820
02:07:21,840 --> 02:07:22,920
Give me those photos.

2821
02:07:25,130 --> 02:07:25,960
Sir…

2822
02:07:30,630 --> 02:07:32,500
I’ve come so far,

2823
02:07:32,500 --> 02:07:34,340
but this Arun Patil ...

2824
02:07:34,340 --> 02:07:36,420
...is coming in the way of my political dreams.

2825
02:07:37,550 --> 02:07:39,000
Arun Patil,

2826
02:07:39,210 --> 02:07:41,500
what a sweet fellow he is…

2827
02:07:50,340 --> 02:07:51,750
My God!

2828
02:07:58,170 --> 02:07:59,630
Dear media friends,

2829
02:07:59,630 --> 02:08:00,880
as you know,

2830
02:08:00,960 --> 02:08:04,050
only two days are left for voting.

2831
02:08:04,050 --> 02:08:05,500
Last night,

2832
02:08:05,500 --> 02:08:06,500
I have been assaulted.

2833
02:08:08,550 --> 02:08:11,050
You may ask, who has done this to you?

2834
02:08:12,750 --> 02:08:14,420
It is my honourable opponent,

2835
02:08:15,960 --> 02:08:17,710
Mr. Arun Patil!

2836
02:08:21,500 --> 02:08:22,670
No, its Falooda.

2837
02:08:31,130 --> 02:08:32,130
Both of you...

2838
02:08:32,340 --> 02:08:33,340
...have to hit me!

2839
02:08:36,800 --> 02:08:40,840
He called Lavanya and me to his home for dinner.

2840
02:08:40,840 --> 02:08:42,800
We were having dinner.

2841
02:08:43,300 --> 02:08:48,590
He said, please don’t expose my other scandals with the women…

2842
02:08:51,210 --> 02:08:52,550
Suddenly,

2843
02:08:52,550 --> 02:08:56,380
he beat the crap out of me …

2844
02:09:12,050 --> 02:09:12,920
Monjunath…

2845
02:09:14,130 --> 02:09:16,550
By the time...

2846
02:09:17,090 --> 02:09:20,090
...he could take more photos…

2847
02:09:21,710 --> 02:09:22,500
Help me…

2848
02:09:34,170 --> 02:09:37,380
No Pramod! No Pramod! No Pramod, no!

2849
02:09:37,380 --> 02:09:39,250
Come on! Come on!

2850
02:09:43,960 --> 02:09:45,960
Pramod, tag me!

2851
02:09:47,090 --> 02:09:47,920
Sir,

2852
02:09:49,170 --> 02:09:50,750
Sorry sir!

2853
02:10:14,550 --> 02:10:16,880
He thrashed me a lot Nanjundiah…

2854
02:10:16,880 --> 02:10:17,880
I wont leave him!

2855
02:10:17,880 --> 02:10:19,090
Who does he think he is, this Arun Patil?

2856
02:10:19,090 --> 02:10:21,090
Nanja, please calm down. Please!

2857
02:10:22,500 --> 02:10:24,590
Nanja, please calm down. Please!

2858
02:10:25,750 --> 02:10:27,050
Dear media friends,

2859
02:10:28,550 --> 02:10:30,590
I’m requesting you.

2860
02:10:31,920 --> 02:10:34,170
Please don’t share this with anyone.

2861
02:10:34,170 --> 02:10:36,840
Please let this stay between us.

2862
02:10:39,210 --> 02:10:42,750
What was happening so far in the parliament

2863
02:10:42,750 --> 02:10:47,340
between our politicians has now become personal!

2864
02:10:51,380 --> 02:10:52,340
Why did he hit him?

2865
02:10:52,340 --> 02:10:52,880
What?

2866
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:01,550
Why are you guys watching all this?

2867
02:11:01,550 --> 02:11:02,840
That guy is a twisted b…

2868
02:11:09,590 --> 02:11:11,000
I’ll get this fixed.

2869
02:11:23,050 --> 02:11:24,050
Hey, come here!

2870
02:11:24,500 --> 02:11:25,500
Give your Voter’s ID!

2871
02:11:27,340 --> 02:11:28,340
Give him the alcohol!

2872
02:11:29,420 --> 02:11:30,420
Have fun! Enjoy!

2873
02:11:33,340 --> 02:11:34,340
Take his Voter ID.

2874
02:11:53,920 --> 02:11:55,090
Your name?

2875
02:11:55,090 --> 02:11:56,170
Mallikarjun.

2876
02:12:07,420 --> 02:12:08,300
Take it and move!

2877
02:12:08,840 --> 02:12:09,670
Free clothes!

2878
02:12:12,380 --> 02:12:13,210
Take the voter ID.

2879
02:12:13,210 --> 02:12:13,750
Next?

2880
02:12:14,960 --> 02:12:17,460
Yeah, Hi Monjunath. Please come on my face!

2881
02:12:17,460 --> 02:12:18,380
Sir?

2882
02:12:19,130 --> 02:12:20,550
FaceTime, yeah, please!

2883
02:12:20,550 --> 02:12:21,630
Okay, Sir!

2884
02:12:23,500 --> 02:12:25,130
Did you vote for me?

2885
02:12:25,130 --> 02:12:26,300
Yes sir!

2886
02:12:26,300 --> 02:12:27,380
Rascal.

2887
02:12:27,380 --> 02:12:30,710
Listen, all the Voter ID’s that you have taken from people, return them.

2888
02:12:30,710 --> 02:12:34,300
We always need our people to think positively about us.

2889
02:12:34,300 --> 02:12:35,050
Okay..

2890
02:12:35,050 --> 02:12:35,920
Take care.

2891
02:12:35,920 --> 02:12:38,130
Bye now! Happy voting, Bye!

2892
02:12:38,130 --> 02:12:39,170
Bye sir!

2893
02:12:39,670 --> 02:12:42,090
Sir, what is your opinion about the election result?

2894
02:12:42,170 --> 02:12:43,550
May the best candidate win,

2895
02:12:43,550 --> 02:12:46,630
and whoever wins should work for the well-being of our state.

2896
02:12:46,630 --> 02:12:48,710
Looking at the citizens’ interest in these elections⁠⁠⁠⁠,

2897
02:12:48,710 --> 02:12:50,920
The Election Committee has decided to declare

2898
02:12:50,920 --> 02:12:53,300
the results in a Public Event.

2899
02:12:53,300 --> 02:12:54,300
Who will be the next MLA of their constituency...

2900
02:12:54,300 --> 02:12:56,590
Mr. Arun Patil or Humble Politician Nograj!

2901
02:12:57,420 --> 02:12:59,670
What does Humble mean?

2902
02:13:16,050 --> 02:13:18,000
Pramod, if we win,

2903
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:19,340
we give sweets,

2904
02:13:19,340 --> 02:13:20,340
but if we lose,

2905
02:13:21,380 --> 02:13:22,250
we beat.

2906
02:13:27,090 --> 02:13:28,550
Our king,

2907
02:13:28,550 --> 02:13:29,460
Nograj!

2908
02:13:29,460 --> 02:13:30,590
Our king,

2909
02:13:30,590 --> 02:13:31,630
Nograj!

2910
02:13:31,630 --> 02:13:32,750
Our king,

2911
02:13:32,750 --> 02:13:33,800
Nograj!

2912
02:13:33,800 --> 02:13:34,920
Our king,

2913
02:13:34,920 --> 02:13:35,960
Nograj!

2914
02:13:35,960 --> 02:13:37,090
Our king,

2915
02:13:37,090 --> 02:13:38,130
Nograj!

2916
02:13:38,130 --> 02:13:39,550
As you can see,

2917
02:13:39,550 --> 02:13:43,000
the fight to the finish is as close as it can get.

2918
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:44,960
People are very curious to find out.....

2919
02:13:44,960 --> 02:13:47,880
Who the next MLA of our constituency will be?

2920
02:13:47,880 --> 02:13:48,710
Come, let’s see!

2921
02:13:49,500 --> 02:13:51,380
Victory to... Nograj!

2922
02:13:51,550 --> 02:13:53,420
Victory to... Nograj!

2923
02:13:53,550 --> 02:13:55,210
Victory to... Nograj!

2924
02:13:55,670 --> 02:14:01,800
Who will win? Arun Patil!

2925
02:14:05,460 --> 02:14:07,380
Sir, congratulations!

2926
02:14:08,550 --> 02:14:10,460
Pramod, keep weapons.. ready...

2927
02:14:11,210 --> 02:14:11,960
Come back!

2928
02:14:14,170 --> 02:14:17,050
You are my God Nograj Sir!

2929
02:14:17,050 --> 02:14:17,880
Let go of him…Leave him…

2930
02:14:17,880 --> 02:14:20,050
Leave me man, leave me!

2931
02:14:20,050 --> 02:14:20,630
Lavanya!

2932
02:14:23,670 --> 02:14:25,420
You are my God Nograj Sir!

2933
02:14:25,420 --> 02:14:27,840
I wont leave you sir!

2934
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:33,590
Leave me man! Leave me!

2935
02:14:52,750 --> 02:14:58,500
(music)

2936
02:15:12,460 --> 02:15:20,210
By gaining 78,675 popular votes

2937
02:15:20,210 --> 02:15:22,210
your constituency’s...

2938
02:15:23,750 --> 02:15:26,050
...elected MLA is…

2939
02:15:32,340 --> 02:15:35,130
Humble Politician Nograj!

2940
02:15:43,840 --> 02:15:47,500
Hail… Nograj!

2941
02:16:18,210 --> 02:16:20,050
If you throw dirt at me,

2942
02:16:20,050 --> 02:16:22,210
be sure that I wont do the same…

2943
02:16:35,590 --> 02:16:38,590
Every person can change for the better…

2944
02:16:41,340 --> 02:16:44,170
I’m not doing any of this to fight with you.

2945
02:16:44,170 --> 02:16:46,500
I’m doing my work to genuinely help people.

2946
02:16:55,550 --> 02:16:56,460
I…

2947
02:16:57,500 --> 02:16:58,960
I want to...

2948
02:16:58,960 --> 02:17:00,420
...say a few words….

2949
02:17:04,920 --> 02:17:07,590
Today,

2950
02:17:08,800 --> 02:17:10,670
I have become your MLA.

2951
02:17:12,840 --> 02:17:15,090
But if...

2952
02:17:16,670 --> 02:17:20,000
I was one of you,

2953
02:17:21,550 --> 02:17:24,130
I would’ve voted for him.

2954
02:17:25,250 --> 02:17:26,590
Mr. Arun Patil!

2955
02:17:28,630 --> 02:17:30,920
In our society,

2956
02:17:31,880 --> 02:17:33,300
There are too many problems,

2957
02:17:34,590 --> 02:17:35,800
And he...

2958
02:17:36,630 --> 02:17:38,550
...is trying to figure out solutions to solve those problems.

2959
02:17:38,750 --> 02:17:40,840
You like me,

2960
02:17:40,840 --> 02:17:43,630
Because I’ll do....

2961
02:17:43,880 --> 02:17:45,710
....anything for your attention.

2962
02:17:49,710 --> 02:17:51,670
Act in a stupid manner.

2963
02:17:54,300 --> 02:17:56,000
Be mad.

2964
02:18:00,670 --> 02:18:02,960
Create a sensation.

2965
02:18:04,090 --> 02:18:05,590
Be funny.

2966
02:18:07,630 --> 02:18:10,130
Be a Politician.

2967
02:18:14,130 --> 02:18:17,420
Fake being humble.

2968
02:18:25,630 --> 02:18:27,050
But this fellow,

2969
02:18:29,090 --> 02:18:30,590
Mr. Arun Patil,

2970
02:18:32,250 --> 02:18:33,590
you are...

2971
02:18:34,130 --> 02:18:35,880
...something else only!

2972
02:18:39,960 --> 02:18:41,420
Shri. Arun Patil!

2973
02:18:43,670 --> 02:18:45,300
Please...

2974
02:18:47,300 --> 02:18:48,670
...stand me on stage.

2975
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:53,210
Please...

2976
02:18:54,420 --> 02:18:55,750
...come.

2977
02:18:55,750 --> 02:18:57,170
Please come.

2978
02:19:24,170 --> 02:19:26,050
Shri. Arun Patil,

2979
02:19:26,960 --> 02:19:28,250
between the two of us,

2980
02:19:28,630 --> 02:19:31,050
if someone should be MLA,

2981
02:19:32,420 --> 02:19:33,960
It has to be you.

2982
02:19:36,750 --> 02:19:38,170
Please....

2983
02:19:38,670 --> 02:19:40,050
...accept this.

2984
02:20:18,670 --> 02:20:20,250
Not now Rascal!

2985
02:20:20,250 --> 02:20:22,130
Come after 5 years.

2986
02:20:36,300 --> 02:20:38,050
Patil…

2987
02:20:39,300 --> 02:20:40,590
Look at them.

2988
02:20:47,250 --> 02:20:48,500
Just like them…

2989
02:20:49,550 --> 02:20:51,000
And them…

2990
02:20:51,630 --> 02:20:52,880
You also...

2991
02:20:52,880 --> 02:20:54,840
...believed in everything that I said here…

2992
02:20:56,130 --> 02:20:57,880
Our job as politicians...

2993
02:20:57,880 --> 02:20:59,500
...is to just talk,

2994
02:21:00,170 --> 02:21:03,090
because we know that Citizens will believe everything.

2995
02:21:04,090 --> 02:21:05,420
Shri Arun Patil,

2996
02:21:05,420 --> 02:21:07,170
its better for you to just be a Citizen.

2997
02:21:08,420 --> 02:21:11,340
Let me play all the Politics, okay?

2998
02:21:21,090 --> 02:21:24,000
You could’ve exposed his water mafia racket,

2999
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:24,920
why didn't you?

3000
02:21:24,920 --> 02:21:25,840
I could have,

3001
02:21:26,460 --> 02:21:27,590
but I promised myself,

3002
02:21:27,590 --> 02:21:29,500
that I will not fall as low as his level.

3003
02:21:29,750 --> 02:21:30,960
But how did he win,

3004
02:21:31,340 --> 02:21:32,880
and that too with such a margin?

3005
02:21:33,170 --> 02:21:34,250
I thought it was neck to neck.

3006
02:21:34,840 --> 02:21:35,460
Maybe.

3007
02:21:35,960 --> 02:21:37,550
He may not even be fit for this job…

3008
02:21:38,250 --> 02:21:41,880
But there is no chance that he could’ve bought all the votes…

3009
02:21:41,880 --> 02:21:44,590
People themselves have voted for him.

3010
02:21:44,590 --> 02:21:45,750
People voted for him..

3011
02:21:47,090 --> 02:22:02,750
Victory to Nograj!

3012
02:22:04,800 --> 02:22:08,210
Greetings, my dear friends!

3013
02:22:24,300 --> 02:22:26,210
What a nice Bus Stop we’ve made!

3014
02:22:26,210 --> 02:22:27,550
Why are people complaining?

3015
02:22:27,550 --> 02:22:28,920
Monjunath! please..

3016
02:22:29,090 --> 02:22:30,420
There is a blind person standing there!

3017
02:22:30,420 --> 02:22:32,840
My grandmother always said that,

3018
02:22:32,840 --> 02:22:34,590
whenever you see a blind person,

3019
02:22:35,170 --> 02:22:37,050
you have to always help him cross the road.

3020
02:22:37,630 --> 02:22:38,340
Greetings!

3021
02:22:38,340 --> 02:22:40,000
Please come, yeah, please come!

3022
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:40,630
Look,

3023
02:22:40,630 --> 02:22:42,750
you may not have eyes, but you have a heart.

3024
02:22:42,750 --> 02:22:44,300
So what if you cant see,

3025
02:22:44,300 --> 02:22:46,500
we politicians only are the vision for you all.

3026
02:22:46,710 --> 02:22:49,420
Please take a Snapchat for social media, Monjunath!

3027
02:22:49,420 --> 02:22:50,380
Okay Sir!

3028
02:22:52,250 --> 02:22:53,050
Oh!

3029
02:22:53,050 --> 02:22:54,000
My bus stop...

3030
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:55,210
...is this side, is it?

3031
02:22:55,750 --> 02:22:56,750
Sir...

3032
02:22:57,500 --> 02:22:58,300
this way!

3033
02:22:58,300 --> 02:22:59,170
Thank you Sir!

3034
02:22:59,460 --> 02:23:03,090
More people should have a big heart such as yours.
