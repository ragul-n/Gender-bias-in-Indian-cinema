1
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:47,292
Throw it. Throw each thing out.

2
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:49,358
He is not my son in
law that I would...

3
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:51,062
...keep him in my house for
3 months without rent.

4
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:54,072
In the first month he said that he
will get the money from Bombay.

5
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,405
In the 2nd month he said that he
received the money, but got stolen.

6
00:02:57,477 --> 00:03:00,105
And the wretched now says that
his granny has expired.

7
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,172
Thief, loafer, cheater, liar!
Earns 100 rupees.

8
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:05,513
And wants a house worth
200 rupees per month.

9
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:09,180
Says such lies that his
uncle is a millionaire.

10
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:11,246
He is the owner of half of Bombay.

11
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:12,848
If he wishes, he can buy
the whole of Delhi.

12
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,392
He is totally shameless!

13
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:19,864
If he tries to enter this house
again, just throw him out.

14
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,365
Manglu, next time find
out such a tenant...

15
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:25,268
...who is either a married
man or a sage!

16
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:27,329
So that he does not run away...

17
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:29,034
...from the house every time
I ask for the rent.

18
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:31,099
God knows when this loafer
returns in the night...

19
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:32,872
...and when he leaves the
house in the morning.

20
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,071
Curse you, Shri Madan Gopal!

21
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:51,221
The owner is outside the house.

22
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:02,232
Lost this house, too.

23
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:09,171
Come, come, my piece of moon,
Shri Madan Gopal!

24
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,012
Who has put the lock on my door?

25
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:12,344
You are great!

26
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,183
You don't pay rent for 3 months
and then vanish for 2 months.

27
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,192
Would the owner praise
you or lock the house?

28
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:23,856
Why didn't you return
for so many days?

29
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,363
Would I come here to be beaten when
I haven't paid for 3 months?

30
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:31,369
I see. So where did you stay then?
- Found another house.

31
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:34,867
Very good. And where do you
find the rent for that?

32
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,373
I don't pay!
- What? - I don't. - Then what?

33
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:40,535
Today I got thrown out
from there, too.

34
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:46,276
What's the plan then?
- Looking for 3rd house.

35
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:51,387
You cheater! Your mail has been
piling up for 2 months.

36
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,118
Must be the bills. What else?

37
00:04:56,229 --> 00:05:01,997
Here. - Invitation to a marriage.
Notice. Bill.

38
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:04,325
What is this?

39
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:17,175
Madan, child, I'm coming back.

40
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:26,514
Nau (nine) Do (two) Gyarah (eleven).

41
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:32,586
What happened, pal?

42
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:37,593
Nau Do Gyarah.

43
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:50,209
Pal, is he your uncle?
- Yes, but looks like he is a crack.

44
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:53,617
He is leaving me a property
of 11 lakhs!

45
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:59,388
Buddy, get me a nice suit. - Right
away. But your uncle is great!

46
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:12,160
Who permitted you to come in
the room without permission?

47
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:15,173
And you also know that it is not
allowed to smoke in this room.

48
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:20,178
What is this? Get out from
here. You are fired!

49
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:38,357
Sir, can I get some advance?
- Why not? Thousand? 2 thousands?

50
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:40,422
Not that much. Just
to buy a ' pom pom'

51
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,189
Hey, Madan!

52
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:57,196
Strange! From where did
you bring this junk?

53
00:08:57,603 --> 00:09:00,970
From where did you bring this
junk? Whose marriage is it?

54
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:03,298
Come, I'll introduce you to all.

55
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:10,138
Who is the unlucky man getting
stuck in marriage?

56
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:13,310
Call him lucky. He is a
hotel owner in Bombay.

57
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,479
God knows what tricks he plays.

58
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:19,992
What magic he does! Has trapped
a daughter of a rich man.

59
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:23,153
Traps? These cheaters
are just like that.

60
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:26,154
But there is no dearth of
fools who get trapped.

61
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,496
Son, I did not expect this from you.

62
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,502
Neither did I expect this from you.

63
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,999
What have you given me? Nothing.

64
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:36,334
Is this a marriage or a drama?

65
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,842
You can think over for 5 minutes...

66
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,001
...or else the marriage procession
might go back.

67
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:47,349
Raksha, Sujit is asking
for 50,000 more.

68
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:49,848
Pal, I've heard such things
about this man...

69
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:53,355
...that if the girl's family hears
them, they would cancel the marriage.

70
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:55,349
This man does not seem
to be a good person.

71
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,589
So the girl's life
is being destroyed!

72
00:09:57,863 --> 00:09:59,524
If I were in her place,
I would run away.

73
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:02,027
What will you do now, Raksha?

74
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,864
But where are you going?
- To Bombay. - In this truck?

75
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:07,369
What did you say?
- Yes, in this junk?

76
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,373
Look, if you say anything bad about
my car, I won't forgive you.

77
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:43,892
I am a traveler of love.
Don't say anything to me.

78
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:59,245
I love those who meet me with love.

79
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:21,367
I accept grief. I
also accept relief.

80
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:32,378
I have all kinds of flowers
in my garland.

81
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:06,182
Hot sunlight was written in my
fate. I have lived in sunlight.

82
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:16,590
When I got the moonlight, I slept
for a while in the moonlight.

83
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:59,064
Trusting my heart, I
live just like this.

84
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:10,171
I laugh on one step, and
cry on another step.

85
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:04,163
I swear on you I have been
waiting for you since long.

86
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:15,174
At least look at me. Doesn't
matter if you don't talk.

87
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:45,366
Boot?!

88
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:15,504
Greetings. Did you have
any trouble on the trip?

89
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:38,190
Jewelry? Thief! Police! Police!

90
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:54,369
Lmmoral character

91
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:10,484
Don't try to run away.

92
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:19,327
Master, I'm a millionaire
of Banvari.

93
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:21,396
And he is your brother in law?

94
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:26,167
I'm going to Bombay.
- In this old junk?

95
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:36,011
I want some petrol. - So? - I'm
borrowing. - Get back on your way.

96
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:41,019
Listen! - Don't irritate
me. - Take my watch.

97
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:45,029
Mister, go! - Please... - Will
you go or shall I smash you?

98
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:54,369
Stolen money?
- It's borrowed. Take it.

99
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,199
Come on, mister. Give
me some petrol.

100
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:01,812
The root of every trouble. Come.

101
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:10,978
Don't think that you've bribed me.

102
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:12,813
I'll pay back each penny
of yours before...

103
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:14,481
...handing you over to
the police. Got that?

104
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:20,988
Got it, pal. - Pal? When did
we become friends? You thief!

105
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:36,837
Let us rest for some time.

106
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:40,843
Where shall we get water here?

107
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:56,357
Water from a thief's hand? Never!

108
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,350
What is it?
- Sweat!

109
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,421
You won't have food from
a thief's hand, right?

110
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:02,364
O Lord Ram!

111
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,597
Shall I go on a stroll again?

112
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:21,881
Don't think that I won't
hand your over...

113
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,885
...to the police now that
I've eaten your food.

114
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,887
No, pal, no. Have some more.

115
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:29,383
Look, we are not friends yet.

116
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:46,571
Hot sunlight was written in my
fate. I have lived in sunlight.

117
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:58,082
When I got the moonlight, I slept
for a while in the moonlight.

118
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:09,357
I love those who meet me with love.

119
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:28,042
What happened?
- I am very tired.

120
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:30,378
If I fall asleep, I would
bump into someone.

121
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:33,390
Shall I drive?
- You? You would ruin my car.

122
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:35,890
Just watch. Come here. Come.

123
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:40,395
You have a very delicate
waist! How come?

124
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,899
Get off. Talk such things to a girl.

125
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:48,066
Wow, dear!
- Give me five!

126
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:58,577
What is your name?
- Sardar Nihalsingh.

127
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:19,360
So you bumped at last? I
knew this would happen.

128
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:21,099
Now we'll have to spend
the night here.

129
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:26,371
Thief, goon, robber, bear,
cat, elephant, mouse!

130
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:28,206
Now spend the night
with all of them.

131
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:35,376
It's so dark. - Shall I buy the
moon for you?! - Yes, please!

132
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:38,287
Aren't you ashamed, thief?
- Why do you say bad words to me?

133
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:41,349
Get down. Go!

134
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:54,903
Where have you gone? Get the truck
out. You've stuck it there.

135
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:59,900
Vanished? Son of a king!
I am not your servant...

136
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:02,343
...that you would rest while I work.

137
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:05,509
Hey you the root of all trouble,
where are you?

138
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:12,581
Snake!
- Snake? - Yes, snake. Snake!

139
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:22,023
You coward! - You brave! - Now
shut up and go to sleep.

140
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:06,833
Back off you...

141
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:15,342
What kind of a Sikh you are?
No Kada? No Kirpal?

142
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:21,357
None of your business. - Wow, dear.
But you are a useful man.

143
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:23,858
If you hadn't been a thief,
I would have...

144
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:26,020
...taken you as a servant with
monthly salary of 10-15 rupees.

145
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:28,855
A girl like me can keep
50 men like you...

146
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:31,025
...as my servant with a monthly
salary of 500 rupees!

147
00:24:33,371 --> 00:24:45,215
A boy like me! - A girl? A boy?
Girl! Boy! Girl! Boy!

148
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,503
Nail polish!

149
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:42,029
O Lord Ram!

150
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:03,317
What an era has come up!

151
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:05,986
Women now become a
bus conductor, too!

152
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:15,996
A soldier, too. And... and...
O God! She is beautiful.

153
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:18,502
Greetings.

154
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:22,177
You got only this car of
decent man to hide in?

155
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:25,175
Had you been caught, I would
be in jail, too, with you.

156
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,341
And this new car of mine...
- Old truck!

157
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,855
Truck? - Yes, truck. - Look,
miss if you say...

158
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:35,015
...anything bad about my car for
3rd time, I will throw you out.

159
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:37,855
Junk!

160
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:42,856
You think I can't walk?
- Try it.

161
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:47,031
If you get tired, you can return.
- My foot!

162
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:43,010
O little bud, where are you
going in this sunlight?

163
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:59,359
Listen, dear, I am going
where you won't be.

164
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:36,331
Why are you jealous? I am
walking at my heart's wish.

165
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:44,013
If you don't stop now, your
delicate feet will start aching.

166
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:04,358
Don't be crazy. Where
are you going, dear?

167
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:37,392
None of your business if
I won't be able to walk.

168
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:40,902
If you don't get support...

169
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:44,405
...you will return once
again at my call.

170
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:05,353
Where will you go hiding from me?

171
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:45,393
If you won't listen, I will
go away. Don't call me now.

172
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:50,238
Go if you are going. Don't
show me any favor.

173
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:53,072
You cannot target my heart.

174
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:14,024
Where are you going so proudly,
flying in the air?

175
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:28,036
Stop! Stop!

176
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:21,879
Is that enough? Shall we go?

177
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:31,188
I am hungry.

178
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:47,867
I am...
- Hungry? Me, too.

179
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:53,877
Come.

180
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:07,328
Here, eat this.
- Peas?

181
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:43,197
Looks like you have had
too much of vitamin Z.

182
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:50,371
What else? - Water. - Do you
take me to be your servant?

183
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,204
Companion!
- I don't want such company.

184
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:03,817
Are you very thirsty? Very?

185
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:09,816
Let's see if we can get something.
Or it's your bad luck.

186
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:12,485
Come.

187
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:33,340
Yes, there is water!

188
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:44,517
You also just smell
it and come along.

189
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:49,356
There's no bucket or rope. If
you think I would dive, sorry.

190
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,866
You can do that yourself.

191
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,361
But you'll learn a lesson from this.

192
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,031
You are thirsty, and
there's the water.

193
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:02,138
And... both want to hug each other.

194
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:05,972
But there's no bucket in your fate.

195
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:11,550
I wish I could be a bucket
to quench your thirst.

196
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:26,326
Why not spend this beautiful
night here?

197
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:34,505
I am thirsty. - I am thirsty,
too. But not for water.

198
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:38,012
What for then? For pipe?
- Yes, pipe.

199
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:17,314
It is my opinion that
life is interesting.

200
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:23,316
What is your opinion? Hey, thief!

201
00:39:49,353 --> 00:39:52,345
What is in your eyes?
- Silver cloud.

202
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:57,521
What is in the cloud?
- Someone's drape.

203
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:04,027
What's in the drape?
- A strange hustle and bustle.

204
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:48,078
The weather is nice.
- It is because of you.

205
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:52,947
It is still less.
- I am waiting for you.

206
00:41:04,361 --> 00:41:08,229
You look very innocent. But
actually you are very smart.

207
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:05,011
My eyelids are lowering.
- Let them lower.

208
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:11,590
My hair is flying.
- Let it fly touching the lips.

209
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:26,540
You look very innocent. But
actually you are very smart.

210
00:42:56,407 --> 00:43:01,344
My drape is flying.
- May our eyes meet!

211
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:06,179
The breath is moving faster. - May
we travel the path with relief.

212
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:20,524
You look very innocent. But
actually you are very smart.

213
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:54,880
Where will you go?

214
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:01,330
Where shall I go?
- You will go somewhere.

215
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,491
Won't you take me to
the police station?

216
00:45:06,336 --> 00:45:08,327
Who are you?
- A thief!

217
00:45:33,363 --> 00:45:36,025
It is this place.

218
00:45:40,104 --> 00:45:43,540
Do you know that I am doing a
crime by supporting a thief?

219
00:45:43,607 --> 00:45:46,872
Who told you to?
- Who told me? Very good.

220
00:45:47,211 --> 00:45:49,543
I am going to meet my friend, then
we'll go to the police station.

221
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:52,371
And you don't run away, ok?

222
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:13,163
Madan! - Worthless! - Donkey!
- Cheater! - Traitor!

223
00:46:17,007 --> 00:46:18,998
How come you are here?
- Didn't you get the news?

224
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:21,510
Which news?
- Stand away and talk.

225
00:46:22,012 --> 00:46:25,004
This man Madan Gopal
is now a millionaire.

226
00:46:25,082 --> 00:46:25,844
What are you blabbering?

227
00:46:26,016 --> 00:46:28,007
My dear, uncle has given me his
property worth Rs. 11 lakhs.

228
00:46:28,185 --> 00:46:30,176
And wrote to me to come
to Bombay immediately.

229
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:34,180
And you come now?
- What do you mean?

230
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,021
Don't you know anything about
your uncle? - Know what?

231
00:46:41,365 --> 00:46:42,855
So is uncle...

232
00:46:44,368 --> 00:46:48,031
Yes, may God not give
such a death to anyone!

233
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:52,035
When did this happen?
- It is almost 1 and a half month.

234
00:46:52,376 --> 00:47:00,806
When is this letter written?
January. It is 2 months old.

235
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:07,984
And his property? - Given to his
sister in law's daughter, Kuldeep.

236
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:11,321
But that was the earlier will.
- So was there another will?

237
00:47:11,395 --> 00:47:12,987
Yes, of course. See this.

238
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:17,823
Madan, child, you must
be knowing that...

239
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:19,832
...I had given off all my property...

240
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:22,995
...to my sister in law's
daughter, Kuldeep

241
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:27,333
But seeing her behavior
I have changed my mind.

242
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:33,013
So I've written a new will, which
makes all my property yours.

243
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:36,018
See?
- All property in your name!

244
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,011
Come to Bombay immediately.
Manoharlal.

245
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:44,026
The wealth is worth 9 lakhs. And
2 lakhs are kept in the bank.

246
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:48,187
Nau and Do equal to Gyarah.

247
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:52,191
Madan, there's some secret to this.
- Which has to be found out.

248
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:54,203
The true will is certainly
hidden somewhere.

249
00:47:55,272 --> 00:47:55,863
Where is everyone?
- At Mahabaleshwar.

250
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:59,604
Yes, in his last days, they took
uncle to Mahabaleshwar for a change.

251
00:47:59,977 --> 00:48:01,467
A large amount of his
property is there.

252
00:48:02,145 --> 00:48:05,979
If I reach there, no
one of them knows me.

253
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:10,486
Listen, do this. But you're not
married. - What's the matter?

254
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:13,812
A few days back they had given
an ad in the newspaper...

255
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:16,983
...that they need a manager who
can handle their property.

256
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,823
But he should be married.
- Why so?

257
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:22,996
Their last manager had run
away with their servant.

258
00:48:46,356 --> 00:48:50,349
But I am married! - Married? Come
on, you liar! - I mean it.

259
00:48:51,194 --> 00:48:55,358
If you are married, where
is your wife? - Down there.

260
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:05,298
Why did you leave her down?
- She's fine there.

261
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:08,469
How can she be fine? I'll call her
up. - Hey listen! She'll feel bad.

262
00:49:08,545 --> 00:49:11,309
She must be feeling bad now, idiot.
- Listen to me...

263
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:12,814
Listen to me.

264
00:49:20,991 --> 00:49:23,152
Greetings, Bhabhi (sister in law)
- Yes?

265
00:49:23,226 --> 00:49:24,989
This man is very rude.

266
00:49:30,334 --> 00:49:32,495
Look, you've come for the 1st time
at my house after marriage...

267
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:36,562
What? - Darling, I behaved in
a rude way. Got it? - Got it.

268
00:49:37,007 --> 00:49:40,170
My dear...
- What happened, my dear? - Red ant.

269
00:49:40,243 --> 00:49:43,007
Red ant? I'll kill her.
- Ok, it's dead.

270
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,173
The ant is dead and even my granny!

271
00:49:45,248 --> 00:49:49,014
Why are you screaming? It's
just an ant, not a witch.

272
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:56,182
You press my back.
- I'll do that.

273
00:49:56,259 --> 00:49:59,353
When did you marry? - Just now.
- Why didn't you write to me?

274
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:01,420
The marriage wasn't intended.
It just happened.

275
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:03,523
Listen, have you told
her about that wealth?

276
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:03,861
What does she have to do with that?

277
00:50:04,034 --> 00:50:04,864
What does she have to do?

278
00:50:05,202 --> 00:50:07,193
I mean, what's the hurry?
I'll tell her afterwards.

279
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:09,261
No, tell me now. What's the matter?

280
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:14,200
So soon? - Bravo! Keep him under
control just like this, Bhabhi.

281
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:18,542
Bhabhi... but why would I call you
Bhabhi? You are younger to me.

282
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:22,546
What is your name? - Ask him
to tell you my name. - Name?

283
00:50:23,387 --> 00:50:29,383
You tell. - No, ask him. - Tell
him. Why are you acting so childish?

284
00:50:29,459 --> 00:50:32,223
Why don't you tell? - What do I
tell? There's nothing to tell.

285
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:34,627
You are talking as if you don't
know your wife's name.

286
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:37,226
I really don't know.
I'll go and ask her.

287
00:50:39,236 --> 00:50:43,400
Tell me your name. - Witch! - That
you are! But tell me the name.

288
00:50:44,074 --> 00:50:49,569
Raksha. - Bro, her name
is Raksha. - Nice couple!

289
00:50:50,414 --> 00:50:51,574
We are a nice couple!

290
00:50:53,417 --> 00:50:56,648
Madan, I think we should
meet your uncle's lawyer.

291
00:50:57,421 --> 00:51:01,517
The lawyer must be knowing if
another will was written.

292
00:51:01,591 --> 00:51:03,354
I think we should go now.

293
00:51:03,427 --> 00:51:06,021
I've written a new will.

294
00:51:07,364 --> 00:51:10,197
He wrote me this letter from
Mahabaleshwar saying that...

295
00:51:14,037 --> 00:51:17,370
I've made a rough draft of
my second and last will.

296
00:51:18,041 --> 00:51:20,202
If you can come to Mahabaleshwar...

297
00:51:20,544 --> 00:51:23,877
Well, Mr. Madan Gopal,
these 2 letters...

298
00:51:24,047 --> 00:51:27,380
...make it clear that Manohar had
surely written another will.

299
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:30,545
But when I reached Mahabaleshwar,
he had expired.

300
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:33,883
And 2 people had given a statement...

301
00:51:34,057 --> 00:51:36,890
...that he had burnt his second
will before his death.

302
00:51:38,228 --> 00:51:40,219
So the 1st will is considered
legal under every situation.

303
00:51:41,398 --> 00:51:44,060
But it might be that both
those witnesses are fakes.

304
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:46,125
And the 2nd will is lying
hidden somewhere.

305
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:50,070
Listen, take up that
job as a manager.

306
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,231
You'll come to know all
the secrets of the house.

307
00:51:52,309 --> 00:51:54,641
If you want I can give you
a letter of testimony.

308
00:51:55,078 --> 00:51:58,070
What do you say?
- It's fine.

309
00:51:58,248 --> 00:52:01,342
All right, if there's any problem,
send me a telegram.

310
00:52:01,418 --> 00:52:03,409
I'll come immediately.
- Ok.

311
00:55:06,336 --> 00:55:10,170
Don't you have kids?
- Not yet.

312
00:55:17,347 --> 00:55:19,508
Kuldeep!
- Yes, mother.

313
00:55:32,195 --> 00:55:38,361
Kuldeep! - Wait, mother.
They are good people.

314
00:55:38,535 --> 00:55:44,030
Kamala, go and show them
around the house.

315
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:47,366
And then show them their room.

316
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:24,569
Kuldeep!

317
00:56:30,186 --> 00:56:31,175
Come here.

318
00:56:37,594 --> 00:56:40,586
Yes, mother, I know that
I should get married now.

319
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:49,536
Who is that girl Sunita, whom
you like a lot? - Nita?

320
00:56:51,207 --> 00:56:55,371
Why don't you call her here for a
few days? So that I can meet her.

321
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:58,380
Really, mother? Wow! I'll call
her at Bombay today itself.

322
00:56:58,448 --> 00:57:01,315
And will tell her to come
here today. Mother!

323
00:57:03,319 --> 00:57:07,983
Why is this room locked? - No one
goes in there. There's a ghost!

324
00:57:13,329 --> 00:57:15,991
This is my room. And this
is for the guests.

325
00:57:26,342 --> 00:57:28,333
And that down there is yours.

326
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,031
Hey! There's only one room.

327
00:57:59,108 --> 00:58:01,303
So what's that?
- A bathroom. - Bathroom?

328
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:10,975
We're done for!

329
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:14,313
Where will you sleep then?

330
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:20,160
I'll sleep here.
- And where would I sleep? - There.

331
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:22,487
Both of us in the same room?

332
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:26,158
Idea! We'll put up a
curtain in between.

333
00:58:26,569 --> 00:58:28,560
No! I don't agree with this idea.

334
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:33,006
This is a problem. You do this.

335
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:37,336
Make a bed for yourself
in the bathroom!

336
00:58:37,413 --> 00:58:39,506
Me? Aren't you ashamed?

337
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:43,008
You call yourself a man! You don't
know how to respect a woman.

338
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:45,177
What can one do if the
woman is a thief?

339
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:50,015
Learn to respect a woman
even if she is a thief.

340
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,351
That means learn to sleep
in the bathroom.

341
00:58:52,428 --> 00:58:53,861
Come on, Madan, learn this, too.

342
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:58,861
Sleeping with a thief in the
same room would be dangerous.

343
00:59:09,145 --> 00:59:10,134
What did you say?

344
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:13,979
You would sing a song for me before
going to bed, won't you?

345
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:17,486
No! - No? Doesn't matter.
I'll sing for you.

346
00:59:29,165 --> 00:59:32,157
Come. The bird is alone.

347
00:59:33,169 --> 00:59:36,161
Sleep. It's time to sleep.

348
00:59:56,192 --> 01:00:00,526
The sleep has flown
away from my eyes.

349
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:04,363
Enough! Lie down peacefully.

350
01:00:13,042 --> 01:00:16,205
Don't go. I'm scared.
- Is it the time to be scared?

351
01:00:40,403 --> 01:00:43,236
This weather is suffocated.

352
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,573
This breeze is so beautiful.

353
01:00:56,252 --> 01:00:59,244
I'm dying. I'm done for.

354
01:01:00,023 --> 01:01:02,014
The atmosphere is so naughty.

355
01:01:23,212 --> 01:01:27,046
This night is so dull without you.

356
01:01:27,116 --> 01:01:31,212
My heart and heartbeats
are with you.

357
01:01:39,228 --> 01:01:42,561
And yet my heart is lonely.

358
01:01:43,232 --> 01:01:46,395
It is a time for dreams.

359
01:02:11,368 --> 01:02:14,201
Why didn't you show this room?
- No one goes in there.

360
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:15,533
A ghost lives in there!

361
01:02:44,568 --> 01:02:48,561
I'm calling from 870.

362
01:02:56,347 --> 01:03:00,181
Yes. Yes, please.

363
01:05:57,328 --> 01:05:58,317
Who is it?

364
01:05:59,330 --> 01:06:09,001
Who is it? - Bro! Don't go in
this room. A ghost lives here.

365
01:06:39,203 --> 01:06:43,037
How did you remember me
all of a sudden? Really?

366
01:06:45,376 --> 01:06:49,369
My! My! Why not, my dear?

367
01:06:49,446 --> 01:06:52,313
If you wish, I'll leave my job
right now and come over there.

368
01:06:52,383 --> 01:06:55,318
But convince your mother first
for our marriage. Yes.

369
01:07:05,829 --> 01:07:07,319
Tell me, what brings you to Bombay?

370
01:07:07,398 --> 01:07:09,832
I've heard that Raksha
has come this side...

371
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,161
...to Bombay, hiding in a truck
from Delhi. - Is it?

372
01:07:16,006 --> 01:07:18,998
Mr. Lobo, arrange
for sir to stay in.

373
01:07:32,356 --> 01:07:34,847
Listen carefully. You'll take
madam Nita's car for...

374
01:07:35,025 --> 01:07:38,517
...the smuggling of liquor,
and not mine. Got it? Go!

375
01:07:41,031 --> 01:07:43,192
Police should know about this.

376
01:07:43,267 --> 01:07:45,360
And the car should be caught
outside the hotel. Go!

377
01:07:48,372 --> 01:07:50,363
Arrange for the dance.

378
01:09:11,989 --> 01:09:16,153
What would happen if
the day was colorful?

379
01:09:17,161 --> 01:09:20,494
If the sand is shining.
If the sea is blue.

380
01:09:22,166 --> 01:09:26,000
And the sky is wet.

381
01:09:43,187 --> 01:09:47,851
Then it would be so fun. The
sky would be reachable.

382
01:09:48,192 --> 01:09:53,027
The sea would be at halt.
And storm would be hiding.

383
01:10:04,041 --> 01:10:08,034
What would happen if there
were playful songs?

384
01:10:09,046 --> 01:10:13,039
If there are naughty
words on my lips.

385
01:10:14,051 --> 01:10:18,044
If there is monsoon and rain.

386
01:10:34,238 --> 01:10:37,230
Then it would be so fun.

387
01:10:37,307 --> 01:10:42,244
Some people might be falling.
Some might be careful.

388
01:10:42,312 --> 01:10:45,076
And some might some might
be going wayward.

389
01:10:55,359 --> 01:10:59,352
What would happen when
the world is sleeping?

390
01:11:01,031 --> 01:11:04,865
And there is a silence
full of stars.

391
01:11:06,036 --> 01:11:11,201
On every sound the heartbeat
beats faster.

392
01:11:26,056 --> 01:11:29,048
Then it would be so fun.

393
01:11:29,126 --> 01:11:31,219
A heart will meet another heart.

394
01:11:31,295 --> 01:11:34,059
The body will feel so refreshed.

395
01:11:34,131 --> 01:11:36,622
The enemy will feel jealous.

396
01:12:38,395 --> 01:12:41,228
Whose car is that? - Come with me.
I'll tell you everything.

397
01:12:55,345 --> 01:12:56,334
My car?

398
01:13:01,585 --> 01:13:03,348
What does this mean, Sujit?

399
01:13:04,521 --> 01:13:06,352
That means only one thing, Nita.

400
01:13:07,190 --> 01:13:09,852
And that is that, you won't
go anywhere leaving me.

401
01:13:15,198 --> 01:13:17,359
That's it? Such a trifle matter?

402
01:13:17,601 --> 01:13:20,195
What was the need to create
such chaos for that?

403
01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:22,261
This is just my style, Nita.

404
01:13:28,211 --> 01:13:32,204
Won't you give me time to think
over? - Yes, five minutes!

405
01:13:38,221 --> 01:13:42,385
Look, Nita, why do you want to
marry that donkey purposely?

406
01:13:43,226 --> 01:13:48,220
Because he is not an ordinary
donkey. He has golden horns.

407
01:13:49,399 --> 01:13:52,994
So why not pull out those horns
and then kick out the donkey?

408
01:13:54,171 --> 01:13:59,165
How? - I have a plan. But first
let me deal with the police.

409
01:13:59,509 --> 01:14:03,001
But your poor uncle will have
to go to the jail. Ok?

410
01:14:05,182 --> 01:14:07,343
First I heard that Kuldeep
will receive the property.

411
01:14:08,185 --> 01:14:11,018
Then I heard that Kuldeep will
not receive the property.

412
01:14:12,189 --> 01:14:14,851
And now I've heard that Kuldeep
has received the property.

413
01:14:15,192 --> 01:14:19,026
Because Mr. Manohar has suddenly
died. - Suddenly?

414
01:14:22,032 --> 01:14:24,865
Do you get now how to pull
out the golden horns?

415
01:14:27,204 --> 01:14:31,538
A bit. Ok, let me go now.

416
01:14:31,608 --> 01:14:33,599
I've got to go to Mahabaleshwar
tomorrow night.

417
01:14:40,217 --> 01:14:43,880
Listen, Nita. Remember,
that if I come there...

418
01:14:44,054 --> 01:14:48,218
...l'm your bro in front of
all of them! Cousin bro.

419
01:14:54,998 --> 01:14:59,162
This is the land. That is
one of the bungalows.

420
01:14:59,236 --> 01:15:01,329
And other two are behind the hills.

421
01:15:01,404 --> 01:15:03,395
That is the hotel. I'm
the manager there.

422
01:15:04,174 --> 01:15:06,165
How long have you been here?
- One month.

423
01:15:06,243 --> 01:15:08,575
Is there an older servant?
- No, it's only me.

424
01:15:09,179 --> 01:15:11,340
All the older servants were
dismissed one by one.

425
01:15:11,414 --> 01:15:13,405
Isn't there a single old servant?

426
01:15:13,517 --> 01:15:17,283
Yes, there's a gardener,
Kalicharan. But he's nuts.

427
01:15:19,189 --> 01:15:21,180
See that. That's his hut.
- Ok, you can go.

428
01:15:21,258 --> 01:15:24,022
Send other servants also to me.
I want to meet them all.

429
01:15:25,262 --> 01:15:27,355
Kalicharan!

430
01:16:00,997 --> 01:16:03,158
You're sexy!

431
01:16:06,236 --> 01:16:08,500
That's Mr. Kuldeep's bungalow,
isn't it?

432
01:16:11,441 --> 01:16:14,239
Yes, the bungalow is his.
This road is his.

433
01:16:14,311 --> 01:16:15,835
And I am also his... servant.

434
01:16:16,012 --> 01:16:21,348
Oh! Servant? You'll prove useful.

435
01:16:25,355 --> 01:16:27,084
What did the lion say?

436
01:16:27,157 --> 01:16:32,185
The lion said, sparrow,
let me eat your kids.

437
01:16:32,262 --> 01:16:38,201
The sparrow was scared...
- Listen. Fix this button for me.

438
01:16:50,113 --> 01:16:53,139
What's your name?
- Raksha.

439
01:17:01,057 --> 01:17:02,991
Fix the button properly.

440
01:17:03,994 --> 01:17:06,155
Oh! You hurt me.

441
01:17:13,336 --> 01:17:14,496
Donkey!

442
01:18:35,185 --> 01:18:37,176
Hey thief!

443
01:18:51,101 --> 01:18:54,969
Greetings. - What's there
to greet? I'm having fever.

444
01:18:55,038 --> 01:18:56,972
And you feel like playing?

445
01:18:57,040 --> 01:19:00,806
Wash your hands. And
then have your meal.

446
01:19:00,877 --> 01:19:03,072
Food? Where did it come from?

447
01:19:03,146 --> 01:19:05,307
Your granny had come to cook!
- Granny?

448
01:19:21,498 --> 01:19:24,331
What about you?
- I've already eaten.

449
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:29,838
I'm so hungry... so hungry...
that I'll finish everything.

450
01:19:40,183 --> 01:19:44,586
It's a bit more salty, isn't it?
- Yes, more.

451
01:19:46,022 --> 01:19:47,853
I'll learn to improve.

452
01:19:52,028 --> 01:19:54,019
Would you have some more coffee?

453
01:19:54,097 --> 01:19:57,863
Which college do you study at?
- Bombay college.

454
01:19:58,468 --> 01:20:01,266
Do you sing and dance?
- Yes?

455
01:20:01,471 --> 01:20:04,531
Yes, at college festivals.

456
01:20:06,042 --> 01:20:08,374
What does your father do?

457
01:20:14,951 --> 01:20:18,284
Nita, there's a trunk call
for you. From Bombay.

458
01:20:21,491 --> 01:20:25,291
Tell me, Nita, would my
coming there be helpful.

459
01:20:25,361 --> 01:20:31,163
Yes, the weather here is
nice these days. Yes.

460
01:20:37,574 --> 01:20:39,565
Could you find out anything
about the will?

461
01:20:40,076 --> 01:20:44,240
No, but I came to know that an old
servant of uncle lives in the town.

462
01:20:44,314 --> 01:20:46,407
I'll go to meet him
tomorrow morning.

463
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:51,086
Enjoyed the salt!

464
01:20:51,921 --> 01:20:55,015
Ok, listen. You sleep
in the bathroom today.

465
01:20:55,091 --> 01:20:57,116
First wash your hands.
- Right away.

466
01:20:58,394 --> 01:21:00,123
Hey, listen!

467
01:21:00,463 --> 01:21:02,021
Listen!

468
01:21:03,032 --> 01:21:06,468
Wake me up as soon as it's morning.
- Ok. I'll wake you.

469
01:21:39,302 --> 01:21:41,293
Will you have tea?

470
01:22:35,058 --> 01:22:37,219
Shall I come to see you
off till some distance?

471
01:23:22,271 --> 01:23:24,262
Ok...

472
01:23:35,551 --> 01:23:37,382
That...

473
01:23:42,058 --> 01:23:44,219
Enjoyed the tea!

474
01:24:19,195 --> 01:24:25,464
O Ram, my drape is falling.

475
01:24:31,274 --> 01:24:37,270
The days have come to meet my
dear and feel intoxicated.

476
01:24:58,334 --> 01:25:05,502
Looks like the cool breeze has
come in the form of love.

477
01:25:13,516 --> 01:25:19,853
Looks like spring has
come to dull life.

478
01:25:19,922 --> 01:25:23,016
The days have come to
blossom like flowers.

479
01:26:01,330 --> 01:26:08,498
I will sleep in the
garden of dreams.

480
01:26:17,013 --> 01:26:23,111
I will sing like a cuckoo.

481
01:26:23,186 --> 01:26:31,924
The days have come to
chirp on each branch.

482
01:26:52,481 --> 01:26:56,975
I had never seen master so tensed
in my job of 20 years.

483
01:26:57,153 --> 01:27:00,316
That old woman quarreled
every night.

484
01:27:00,389 --> 01:27:04,416
Sir was suffering from heart
ailment. He used to have attacks.

485
01:27:04,493 --> 01:27:10,090
The night of 27th February,
sir's last night...

486
01:27:10,166 --> 01:27:14,227
...when there was a death
like silence everywhere.

487
01:27:14,337 --> 01:27:17,465
It was around 11 o'clock
in the night...

488
01:27:17,540 --> 01:27:20,100
...when suddenly some strange sounds
were heard from sir's room.

489
01:27:20,176 --> 01:27:22,508
I will give to whomever I want.
And won't give if I don't want.

490
01:27:22,578 --> 01:27:26,378
This is not possible. Your wealth
is written in the name of Kuldeep.

491
01:27:26,449 --> 01:27:31,113
And will remain in his name.
- Shut up!

492
01:27:31,254 --> 01:27:33,119
Aren't you ashamed?

493
01:27:33,189 --> 01:27:35,180
You would have died long
back if you wanted to.

494
01:27:35,258 --> 01:27:38,853
If that's so, then get out of
my house right now. Get out!

495
01:27:39,028 --> 01:27:41,360
Get out!

496
01:27:46,435 --> 01:27:50,201
See? I told you not to exert.
Now lie down.

497
01:27:50,273 --> 01:27:52,969
Have you made the bed, Kuldeep?
Lie him on the bed.

498
01:27:53,876 --> 01:27:56,208
Ok, now bring him some milk.

499
01:28:08,057 --> 01:28:12,494
Bring a glass of milk, for
the master. Fast! Hot!

500
01:28:35,918 --> 01:28:37,180
Put it there.

501
01:28:42,525 --> 01:28:48,464
Here, drink the milk.
You should drink some.

502
01:28:53,469 --> 01:28:54,959
You can go.

503
01:28:59,475 --> 01:29:02,410
When I came back in the morning...

504
01:29:02,478 --> 01:29:03,809
...sir's dead body was
lying on the bed.

505
01:29:03,879 --> 01:29:08,077
Don't know when did his heart
stop beating in the night.

506
01:29:08,217 --> 01:29:10,310
The next night when
I heard some noise...

507
01:29:10,386 --> 01:29:11,819
...from sir's room,
I went up to check.

508
01:29:11,987 --> 01:29:15,423
I saw Kuldeep searching the room. -
Don't know what he was looking for.

509
01:29:15,491 --> 01:29:18,824
Next morning he dismissed
me from the job.

510
01:29:18,894 --> 01:29:21,419
And then one by one he dismissed
all the old servants.

511
01:29:21,497 --> 01:29:22,828
And that gardener, Kalicharan?

512
01:29:22,998 --> 01:29:25,159
The poor guy was a bit crazy
from the beginning.

513
01:29:25,234 --> 01:29:28,101
After sir's death he became
even more crack.

514
01:29:28,170 --> 01:29:31,333
And one day Kuldeep accused
him of stealing...

515
01:29:31,407 --> 01:29:34,342
...and bit him so hard that
he totally lost his senses.

516
01:29:34,410 --> 01:29:38,005
They said that he had stolen some
important paper. - Paper?

517
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:40,105
Had master met Kalicharan
before dying?

518
01:29:40,182 --> 01:29:44,050
Yes, one day before his death,
master had called him to his room.

519
01:29:44,120 --> 01:29:47,351
And talked to him for
at least 5 minutes.

520
01:30:15,951 --> 01:30:18,215
One day you'll kill
someone like this!

521
01:30:20,289 --> 01:30:22,223
What happened?

522
01:30:24,059 --> 01:30:27,893
Whenever I look into your
eyes, I drown in them.

523
01:30:27,963 --> 01:30:30,227
Try staying in my eyes once.

524
01:30:31,367 --> 01:30:36,066
Which disease did Mr.
Manoharlal die of?

525
01:30:37,239 --> 01:30:41,642
The same disease that
I have. Heart ailment!

526
01:30:44,580 --> 01:30:48,072
Nita, I've brought a gift for you.
- Give it.

527
01:30:53,355 --> 01:30:54,344
Later.

528
01:31:40,831 --> 01:31:41,889
Did a thorn prick you?

529
01:31:44,835 --> 01:31:45,893
Not in the feet.

530
01:31:48,672 --> 01:31:53,507
O sweetheart, look here.

531
01:31:58,516 --> 01:32:00,507
There are many who look at me.

532
01:32:00,584 --> 01:32:02,779
But your gaze is different.

533
01:32:33,651 --> 01:32:37,644
The spring has come over clouds.

534
01:32:37,721 --> 01:32:41,885
The youth is calling you.
Where are you going?

535
01:32:51,669 --> 01:32:53,830
See that my heart does
not feel jealous.

536
01:33:03,447 --> 01:33:05,847
Your eyes are like
thousands of lamps.

537
01:33:32,810 --> 01:33:36,473
I've come to you with much hope.

538
01:33:46,657 --> 01:33:53,654
Look at me once. My
heart is beating.

539
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:26,794
This girl Nita sings quite well.
- Yes, she catches the tune.

540
01:34:26,864 --> 01:34:31,460
She dances well, too. - Yes, tries
to move her hands and feet.

541
01:34:31,802 --> 01:34:35,636
What has happened to your head?
- The crow hit me with its beak.

542
01:34:40,644 --> 01:34:47,641
You know this Kuldeep? He is crazy
after me. - He is a donkey!

543
01:34:47,718 --> 01:34:49,811
Why? What's wrong with him?

544
01:34:50,654 --> 01:34:55,489
Then do this. Marry him!
- Not a bad idea!

545
01:34:57,995 --> 01:35:01,590
But then what shall I
do of the other guy?

546
01:35:02,433 --> 01:35:06,767
I see! So, there's another guy,
too? Then marry them both!

547
01:35:07,438 --> 01:35:09,770
Ok.
- Ok?

548
01:35:17,448 --> 01:35:19,439
He sleeps in a tub!
He sleeps in a tub!

549
01:35:22,619 --> 01:35:26,612
Hey, child, don't tell anyone, ok?
I'll give you a chocolate.

550
01:35:26,690 --> 01:35:27,782
Listen!

551
01:35:27,958 --> 01:35:30,620
Raksha, a terrible thing has
happened. Open the door.

552
01:35:30,694 --> 01:35:33,458
They'll come to know that we are
not husband and wife. Raksha!

553
01:36:28,619 --> 01:36:30,712
Please, give me the keys
of the files' cupboard.

554
01:36:30,788 --> 01:36:32,449
I need to check some papers.

555
01:36:43,634 --> 01:36:46,626
Hey, you were sleeping
in the bathroom tub!

556
01:36:47,805 --> 01:36:49,466
Why are you hitting me?

557
01:36:51,642 --> 01:36:53,633
Perhaps they both had a fight.

558
01:36:53,710 --> 01:36:55,974
Yes, we might even get a divorce.

559
01:37:05,756 --> 01:37:07,587
Not now, Raksha. Talk
to me at night.

560
01:37:07,658 --> 01:37:09,922
Why did you have to insult
me in front of everyone?

561
01:37:09,993 --> 01:37:11,984
Don't disturb me. This
is my time of work.

562
01:37:12,429 --> 01:37:15,421
Talk about divorce to some one
else. I am not dependent on you.

563
01:37:15,499 --> 01:37:17,490
I also work as much as you do.
- Ok, keep quiet.

564
01:37:17,601 --> 01:37:19,933
Don't think that I'll be
starved if you leave me.

565
01:37:20,437 --> 01:37:22,428
I can feed many men like you.

566
01:37:22,606 --> 01:37:25,439
What do you mean? Go to your room.

567
01:38:14,591 --> 01:38:16,582
Madan, child, come soon...

568
01:38:33,443 --> 01:38:36,606
Look, child, you shouldn't
quarrel like this.

569
01:38:36,680 --> 01:38:38,443
Go and talk to her.

570
01:39:02,406 --> 01:39:04,567
Just like we planned. I
knew you would something.

571
01:39:07,411 --> 01:39:10,574
But, Nita, you never told us
that you also had a brother.

572
01:39:10,747 --> 01:39:14,581
He is my cousin bro.
- Oh! Cousin bro?

573
01:39:15,585 --> 01:39:20,579
Mr. Sujit, what do you do in Bombay?

574
01:39:20,757 --> 01:39:23,419
I own a business over there and...

575
01:39:34,771 --> 01:39:37,433
Who is this girl?
- She is our manager's wife.

576
01:39:37,774 --> 01:39:38,763
Manager's wife!

577
01:39:40,610 --> 01:39:46,776
Why? Do you know her?
- No! No!

578
01:39:50,454 --> 01:39:53,287
An only child of a millionaire...

579
01:39:53,690 --> 01:39:56,284
...runs away from her marriage...

580
01:39:56,460 --> 01:39:59,293
...comes to a place 100s of
miles away from her house...

581
01:39:59,463 --> 01:40:02,557
...and does a petty job, that too
as a wife of a petty manager!

582
01:40:02,899 --> 01:40:07,893
Madan is not a petty man.
He is handsome.

583
01:40:10,741 --> 01:40:13,403
Why did this donkey come at this
moment? Get rid of his quickly.

584
01:40:20,984 --> 01:40:24,420
Oh! You look very nice.

585
01:40:39,770 --> 01:40:40,759
Wear that in my neck.

586
01:41:00,791 --> 01:41:03,282
Mr. Kuldeep, such conversation...

587
01:41:03,460 --> 01:41:07,624
...should take place after marriage.

588
01:41:10,467 --> 01:41:12,799
I cannot take this.
What will bro say?

589
01:41:23,647 --> 01:41:30,644
Ok, go quietly and see whether
he's sleeping again today.

590
01:41:45,502 --> 01:41:48,994
Nita, we are traveling
on the same boat.

591
01:41:49,673 --> 01:41:52,836
People call us the bad ones.

592
01:41:53,677 --> 01:41:55,508
We are made for each other.

593
01:41:55,579 --> 01:41:57,843
And I say, woman like you should
always have a man like me.

594
01:41:58,682 --> 01:42:04,450
I would have married you soon,
if your face was like... Madan.

595
01:42:07,624 --> 01:42:11,458
You're talking like nuts, Nita.
You are my younger sis.

596
01:42:11,528 --> 01:42:15,464
I will marry you to a good
person like Kuldeep.

597
01:42:34,484 --> 01:42:37,647
Kamala, go and call bro Madan.

598
01:42:38,655 --> 01:42:39,644
Madan, child...

599
01:42:46,496 --> 01:42:47,656
Madan!
- Yes?

600
01:42:49,666 --> 01:42:54,660
Madan, when you'll get the wealth,
what will you give me?

601
01:42:56,506 --> 01:42:59,998
To you, Raksha? Whatever
you ask for.

602
01:43:04,447 --> 01:43:06,608
If you were in my place,
what would you ask?

603
01:43:06,783 --> 01:43:11,777
What would I ask?
I would ask... what?

604
01:43:12,622 --> 01:43:14,613
Strange! It is so difficult
to ask, isn't it?

605
01:43:17,627 --> 01:43:22,462
When will you marry? - Marry? No,
dear. It is not for people like me.

606
01:43:22,632 --> 01:43:24,793
If you ask why, then
I am a free bird.

607
01:43:24,968 --> 01:43:26,629
And what is marriage? A cage.

608
01:43:26,803 --> 01:43:28,464
How can freedom and cage coordinate?

609
01:43:28,538 --> 01:43:29,527
Ok, go to sleep.

610
01:43:30,640 --> 01:43:32,471
Ok, tell me when did this
new guest arrive?

611
01:43:32,642 --> 01:43:38,979
Sujit? - Do you know him?
- Know him? Good question!

612
01:43:39,649 --> 01:43:42,641
Didn't I tell you yesterday that
there's another guy, too?

613
01:43:44,654 --> 01:43:47,487
Who according to you will
prove better for me?

614
01:43:47,657 --> 01:43:49,648
Kuldeep or Sujit?

615
01:43:51,661 --> 01:43:55,654
Is this also a joke?
- No, it's only you who crack jokes.

616
01:44:04,774 --> 01:44:07,937
Kamala, why are you standing
out? Come inside.

617
01:44:08,612 --> 01:44:12,946
Madan, darling, look. It's Kamala!
- Coming, sweetheart.

618
01:44:13,617 --> 01:44:14,606
Coming.

619
01:44:25,629 --> 01:44:32,797
What is it, darling? - Bro has
called you. - Ok, I'm coming.

620
01:44:57,827 --> 01:45:00,819
Listen. This letter is to
be reached on this address.

621
01:45:01,765 --> 01:45:03,926
At this hour? - Yes, it's a
long way. Take the truck. Go.

622
01:46:26,616 --> 01:46:31,451
Raksha, it's me, Kuldeep!

623
01:46:31,621 --> 01:46:35,614
Raksha, look what I've brought
for you. See this.

624
01:46:36,626 --> 01:46:40,460
Wear it, Raksha. Wear it.
- Get out of here!

625
01:46:42,632 --> 01:46:45,624
Let go of me! Leave!

626
01:47:10,927 --> 01:47:12,258
You vanished from the marriage...

627
01:47:12,429 --> 01:47:15,262
...just the way money
does from my pocket!

628
01:47:18,601 --> 01:47:20,262
Do you know that your
father has announced...

629
01:47:20,437 --> 01:47:22,268
...a prize of 10,000 rupees
for the person...

630
01:47:22,439 --> 01:47:23,929
...who finds out your whereabouts?

631
01:47:27,444 --> 01:47:29,275
Perhaps you don't even know that...

632
01:47:29,446 --> 01:47:30,936
...your father is staying
at my hotel in Bombay.

633
01:47:52,635 --> 01:47:54,796
Ok, I'll wait in my room then.

634
01:48:58,801 --> 01:49:02,737
Who is that man?
- Might be some lover of mine.

635
01:49:02,805 --> 01:49:04,568
What do you have to do with that?

636
01:50:13,743 --> 01:50:16,974
Raksha, I was eagerly
waiting for you!

637
01:50:28,591 --> 01:50:30,923
I hope this is enough to
keep your mouth shut.

638
01:50:37,600 --> 01:50:38,931
You go now.

639
01:51:03,793 --> 01:51:05,954
Did you see everything?
- Yes.

640
01:51:09,966 --> 01:51:11,957
You must be wanting
me for some work!

641
01:51:17,473 --> 01:51:19,464
Kamala, go and sleep.

642
01:51:22,812 --> 01:51:25,804
Can I sit?
- No need for that.

643
01:51:26,816 --> 01:51:30,479
Mr. Sujit, I want to ask
you some questions.

644
01:51:31,654 --> 01:51:35,988
Answer me with only Yes and No.

645
01:51:36,659 --> 01:51:46,830
First question. Are you
Nita's brother? - No!

646
01:51:48,838 --> 01:51:49,827
Second question.

647
01:51:51,674 --> 01:51:57,670
The greed for money has brought
you here, right? - Yes!

648
01:51:59,515 --> 01:52:04,782
Third question. Do you know Raksha
from the beginning? - Yes.

649
01:52:05,788 --> 01:52:07,779
And Madan?
- No.

650
01:52:11,627 --> 01:52:14,460
What else do you know?
- What else...

651
01:52:16,632 --> 01:52:19,624
I know that Raksha is
not Madan's wife!

652
01:52:23,473 --> 01:52:27,466
I know that Raksha is a daughter
of a wealthy man of Delhi.

653
01:52:29,645 --> 01:52:33,479
I know that Madan has come
here for some special task!

654
01:52:35,651 --> 01:52:39,644
And I also know that you fear Madan!

655
01:52:42,658 --> 01:52:45,821
I want to tell you that
I can get Madan arrested.

656
01:52:59,509 --> 01:53:01,443
Never trust two things.

657
01:53:02,779 --> 01:53:06,613
A woman and soil. They
both deceive us.

658
01:53:07,450 --> 01:53:08,610
Destroy that old woman.

659
01:53:11,621 --> 01:53:16,456
Come, let's dig out the soil. Come.

660
01:53:48,658 --> 01:53:50,649
Yes, I've found where Raksha is.

661
01:53:50,726 --> 01:53:58,826
Really? Where is she? How
is she? Really? Ok. Fine.

662
01:54:03,606 --> 01:54:05,597
Can I ask why are
you so angry today?

663
01:54:08,611 --> 01:54:10,272
You can at least answer my question.

664
01:54:12,782 --> 01:54:16,445
I do a favor to you. On top
of that you insult me.

665
01:54:16,519 --> 01:54:18,510
I won't tolerate this kind
of behavior at all.

666
01:54:18,588 --> 01:54:20,783
Your favors...

667
01:54:22,792 --> 01:54:24,783
Mother has called both of you.

668
01:54:47,817 --> 01:54:48,806
Mother!

669
01:54:54,891 --> 01:54:59,487
You keep a decent girl in your
house and don't marry her.

670
01:55:00,663 --> 01:55:02,756
Do you know what can be
the punishment for this?

671
01:55:11,607 --> 01:55:15,941
To murder someone and seize
someone's property!

672
01:55:16,445 --> 01:55:18,436
Do you know what is the
punishment for that?

673
01:55:24,787 --> 01:55:32,956
Who are you?
- Madan. Manoharlal's nephew.

674
01:55:36,799 --> 01:55:38,289
The true heir of this wealth...

675
01:55:38,868 --> 01:55:44,465
...in whose name the other
will was written.

676
01:55:46,642 --> 01:55:49,475
Liar! Cheater! Lmposter!
- Mother!

677
01:55:53,649 --> 01:55:55,310
What rubbish are you talking?

678
01:55:57,653 --> 01:55:59,314
If you commit another murder...

679
01:55:59,488 --> 01:56:01,319
...it would be difficult
for you to save yourself!

680
01:56:02,758 --> 01:56:04,988
What murder?
- Have you forgotten?

681
01:56:05,761 --> 01:56:09,253
27th February, at 11 o'clock sharp...

682
01:56:09,432 --> 01:56:14,267
...when only few moments of
Manoharlal's life were left...

683
01:56:14,437 --> 01:56:18,271
...you and your mother, both
tormented the poor old man...

684
01:56:18,441 --> 01:56:21,604
...and increased his heart pain.

685
01:56:21,677 --> 01:56:23,269
He got up angrily from his bed...

686
01:56:23,446 --> 01:56:25,437
...and had told you to
get out of his house.

687
01:56:25,781 --> 01:56:28,443
Have you forgotten that night?
What did you do then?

688
01:56:29,618 --> 01:56:32,610
You had started punching on
the chest of that ill man.

689
01:56:33,622 --> 01:56:36,614
The servants thought that his
wife is cleaning his bed.

690
01:56:36,692 --> 01:56:39,024
But the truth was that the old
man was breathing his last.

691
01:56:39,462 --> 01:56:41,794
No! No! This is a lie.
- It is the truth.

692
01:56:42,631 --> 01:56:45,031
After that this old woman wrapped
the dead body in the blanket.

693
01:56:46,469 --> 01:56:50,633
And sent you to call the servant.
It was a nice trick!

694
01:56:50,806 --> 01:56:53,468
A dead body was being drank milk
in front of the servants!

695
01:56:53,542 --> 01:56:54,304
And his legs were pressed...

696
01:56:55,111 --> 01:56:56,806
...so that he would think
that the master is alive.

697
01:56:57,646 --> 01:56:59,307
But people were deceived
at that time.

698
01:56:59,648 --> 01:57:03,414
If he was drunk milk at 11 o'clock.
He should have died after 11.

699
01:57:04,420 --> 01:57:06,581
But Manoharlal was already
murdered before 11 o'clock.

700
01:57:06,655 --> 01:57:08,418
At your hands!
- No, this is not true.

701
01:57:08,491 --> 01:57:11,927
Yes, it did. - No! No! It did
not happen that way! - No?

702
01:57:13,596 --> 01:57:18,260
I had only pushed him. I didn't
know that he would die...

703
01:57:18,434 --> 01:57:19,423
Kuldeep!

704
01:57:54,804 --> 01:57:56,795
Father!

705
01:58:07,750 --> 01:58:12,744
See, that is that wicked man.
- Yes, arrest him. - But why?

706
01:58:13,589 --> 01:58:16,251
You are accused of
having kidnapped...

707
01:58:16,425 --> 01:58:18,416
...his daughter and
his would be wife.

708
01:58:19,428 --> 01:58:20,588
His what?

709
01:58:27,436 --> 01:58:30,599
But inspector... - Whatever you want
to say, say at the police station.

710
01:58:34,610 --> 01:58:37,443
I want to say many things.
- Come.

711
01:58:42,618 --> 01:58:43,607
Madan!

712
01:59:20,589 --> 01:59:24,582
Soil... deceives a person?

713
01:59:26,428 --> 01:59:28,589
You will come back with
me today itself.

714
01:59:28,664 --> 01:59:31,428
I won't go till you release
Madan from the jail.

715
01:59:31,500 --> 01:59:34,264
That cannot happen.
- Then you can go back alone.

716
01:59:34,603 --> 01:59:37,595
Where are you going?
- To meet Madan.

717
01:59:41,610 --> 01:59:43,601
Don't forget to send a
telegram to Radheshyam.

718
01:59:43,679 --> 01:59:46,011
And surely go to meet that
crazy gardener, Kalicharan.

719
01:59:46,448 --> 01:59:49,611
It is possible that he knows
some secret about the will.

720
02:00:30,759 --> 02:00:32,750
Oh! You have high fever.

721
02:00:40,769 --> 02:00:43,431
Water! Water!

722
02:01:00,789 --> 02:01:01,778
Go to sleep.

723
02:01:11,800 --> 02:01:20,640
Kalicharan, Madan will come.
Give this only to him.

724
02:01:20,709 --> 02:01:22,040
And to no one else.

725
02:01:24,647 --> 02:01:31,485
Ok, master. Kalicharan will keep it
safely. He will keep it pressed!

726
02:01:31,820 --> 02:01:33,481
Keep it pressed!

727
02:01:34,657 --> 02:01:36,818
It deceived. The soil deceived me.

728
02:04:27,463 --> 02:04:30,023
I am very anxious. She is
missing from last morning.

729
02:04:31,467 --> 02:04:33,298
Look, I'll find out.

730
02:04:39,641 --> 02:04:42,804
I suspect Madan. You
sent him to jail.

731
02:04:43,479 --> 02:04:45,640
And his men have kidnapped
your daughter.

732
02:04:50,819 --> 02:04:53,310
Remember, if anything happens
to my daughter...

733
02:04:53,489 --> 02:04:55,320
...l'll send you to jail for life.
- Listen to me once.

734
02:05:00,496 --> 02:05:03,590
Come. You are being called.
- Called? - Yes.

735
02:05:09,605 --> 02:05:10,594
Hey!

736
02:05:16,612 --> 02:05:20,275
Hey, cheater, donkey, worthless,
wretched!

737
02:05:20,616 --> 02:05:22,607
Did you get the telegram?
- So you fooled me?

738
02:05:22,684 --> 02:05:24,618
Did you get the telegram?
- I'm here because I received it.

739
02:05:24,686 --> 02:05:26,677
I've given your bail.
- Good.

740
02:05:27,623 --> 02:05:29,614
This inspector happens
to be my friend.

741
02:05:29,691 --> 02:05:31,454
Really? But he does
not listen to me.

742
02:05:31,527 --> 02:05:34,291
I've told him the whole story. Now
he has started believing you.

743
02:05:34,630 --> 02:05:37,793
Yes, but you know that we can't
do anything without evidences.

744
02:05:39,635 --> 02:05:41,626
Listen, they've vanished Raksha.

745
02:05:41,703 --> 02:05:43,295
We'll go out and talk there.

746
02:05:43,639 --> 02:05:45,800
Ok, thank you, inspector.

747
02:05:45,874 --> 02:05:47,535
We'll come again if we need you.
- Sure.

748
02:05:51,647 --> 02:05:54,639
Either she has thrown the will
behind the bushes while running.

749
02:05:55,484 --> 02:05:57,645
Or has hidden somewhere
without my notice.

750
02:05:57,819 --> 02:05:59,980
Doesn't she tell anything?
- How can she?

751
02:06:00,822 --> 02:06:02,915
Not a drop of water has gone down
her throat since yesterday.

752
02:06:03,592 --> 02:06:08,427
Nita, come with me tonight.
I have these sleeping pills.

753
02:06:08,764 --> 02:06:11,426
We'll give it to her. She'll feel
sleepy but we won't let her sleep.

754
02:06:12,434 --> 02:06:16,268
Hunger, thirst and sleep.
She'll have to tell us.

755
02:06:16,772 --> 02:06:26,443
Make it fast. - Let me tie it
first. - Madan, they're coming.

756
02:06:28,617 --> 02:06:31,950
Come out. - You go and hide. - I
said come out. - Let the car start.

757
02:07:52,801 --> 02:07:53,790
Listen, Madan!

758
02:08:20,762 --> 02:08:22,753
Come with the police at
the bungalow. - Ok.

759
02:08:30,772 --> 02:08:31,761
Nita!

760
02:08:32,774 --> 02:08:35,766
Inspector, come fast! - Where? -
I'll tell you everything on the way.

761
02:08:37,946 --> 02:08:41,609
Ah! Now she'll remain unconscious.
Come, Nita.

762
02:08:44,786 --> 02:08:48,449
No one comes to this room. So
no one will know about this.

763
02:08:49,458 --> 02:08:50,948
So, Nita, did you see my management?

764
02:08:51,626 --> 02:08:53,753
How every task is finished easily!

765
02:08:54,463 --> 02:08:56,954
Our fate is shining by itself.

766
02:08:59,634 --> 02:09:03,900
11 lakhs! I have 11 lakhs
in my hands today.

767
02:09:04,740 --> 02:09:07,402
Nita, kiss it once.
Just for luck's sake.

768
02:09:07,743 --> 02:09:09,734
There's my share in it,
too, isn't there?

769
02:09:09,811 --> 02:09:12,746
Of course. What's mine is yours.

770
02:09:32,768 --> 02:09:37,603
Think over. From 11 lakhs, 9 will
be yours and 2 will be mine.

771
02:09:38,607 --> 02:09:41,599
Or else... or I'll make
a deal with Madan.

772
02:09:46,615 --> 02:09:50,016
So, mother, what do you say?

773
02:10:04,733 --> 02:10:09,397
Give that will to me.
- No, never.

774
02:10:36,431 --> 02:10:38,422
How do you know that the
girl is in this house?

775
02:10:38,500 --> 02:10:40,593
I have seen Sujit bring
her here, in this car.

776
02:10:42,771 --> 02:10:45,433
But how can we search the house
without a warrant? - I'll go.

777
02:10:48,443 --> 02:10:50,934
What is that noise up there?

778
02:10:54,783 --> 02:10:55,772
The police has come.

779
02:11:09,798 --> 02:11:11,459
Now a song is being played.

780
02:11:11,800 --> 02:11:13,529
Kuldeep, the police
is here. Kuldeep!

781
02:11:30,819 --> 02:11:33,481
Kamala, you go in. Go in.

782
02:11:37,826 --> 02:11:39,987
Leave my brother. Leave him.

783
02:11:45,834 --> 02:11:47,665
What happened, Kamala?

784
02:11:54,843 --> 02:11:57,835
Mother, save bro Kuldeep. Help him!

785
02:11:58,847 --> 02:12:01,441
Mother! Mother, save brother.

786
02:12:01,516 --> 02:12:02,778
Mother!

787
02:12:06,788 --> 02:12:09,450
Kamala! Kamala!

788
02:12:10,792 --> 02:12:14,785
Go in. Go to the child.
I'll call the police.

789
02:12:16,631 --> 02:12:22,467
Stitch up your tongue!

790
02:12:30,812 --> 02:12:34,805
Fool, may it not happen
that we lose everything.

791
02:13:07,615 --> 02:13:13,611
Hide your sighs. Shut your lips.
Just keep smiling like this.

792
02:13:21,796 --> 02:13:28,793
Keep your tongue chained.

793
02:14:12,447 --> 02:14:14,438
Dear, why are you so restless?

794
02:14:14,516 --> 02:14:18,612
Keep waiting. The spring
will come for you.

795
02:14:26,795 --> 02:14:29,457
Keep living like this.

796
02:15:31,626 --> 02:15:35,460
Listen, o dear. Understand my words.

797
02:15:35,530 --> 02:15:37,964
The atmosphere is not good for you.

798
02:15:45,640 --> 02:15:47,631
Keep an eye on things.

799
02:16:42,463 --> 02:16:45,796
Keep dancing with joy.
Keep kissing me.

800
02:16:45,867 --> 02:16:48,802
O crazy heart, keep dancing
without liquor.

801
02:16:55,810 --> 02:16:57,801
Keep having fun.

802
02:17:38,786 --> 02:17:39,775
Mother!

803
02:17:56,804 --> 02:17:57,793
Radhe, call the police.

804
02:17:59,641 --> 02:18:03,737
Beware, Madan! Raksha
is in this room, too.

805
02:18:05,413 --> 02:18:08,576
I've committed one murder.
I can commit another, too.

806
02:18:09,417 --> 02:18:11,248
If you want Raksha to be safe...

807
02:18:11,419 --> 02:18:14,752
...send off the police
from here immediately.

808
02:18:15,923 --> 02:18:20,417
Madan, I give you 5 minutes.

809
02:18:21,429 --> 02:18:25,263
If within 5 minutes the way for
my escape is not cleared...

810
02:18:25,433 --> 02:18:29,426
...my bullet will go
for Raksha's head.

811
02:18:33,608 --> 02:18:36,600
Remember, 5 minutes. After 5
minutes you won't find Raksha alive.

812
02:18:58,800 --> 02:19:01,394
Madan, 15 seconds are gone.

813
02:19:10,478 --> 02:19:12,742
We have only one way out. Listen.

814
02:19:30,431 --> 02:19:31,420
Did you get it?
- Ok.

815
02:28:17,758 --> 02:28:18,747
Radhe!

816
02:28:31,772 --> 02:28:32,761
5 minutes!

817
02:28:53,794 --> 02:28:55,785
And here is the will.

818
02:29:44,778 --> 02:29:47,770
Wow! An ace? Very good.
Come on. Move.

819
02:29:48,782 --> 02:29:50,773
Shall we go?
