2
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:14,466
Three things
you need to know

3
00:00:14,533 --> 00:00:16,266
about Marjorie Diehl-Armstrong.

4
00:00:17,933 --> 00:00:21,633
The first... she was never
what you would call normal.

5
00:00:22,633 --> 00:00:25,733
As a kid, she grew faster, was awkward...

6
00:00:26,666 --> 00:00:27,500
lonely.

7
00:00:30,733 --> 00:00:33,600
When her parents built her
this life-size dollhouse,

8
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:37,300
the neighborhood kids
finally came over to play.

9
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,800
Marjorie grew up to be a beautiful,
smart, young woman.

10
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,700
She earned a master's degree in education.

11
00:00:51,966 --> 00:00:53,733
People found her captivating.

12
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,466
Especially men,
who would do almost anything for her.

13
00:01:01,366 --> 00:01:04,099
I've been talking with Marge
for over a decade.

14
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:11,366
This is one of the boxes
of letters from Marge.

15
00:01:12,266 --> 00:01:14,000
And this is probably about...

16
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,500
Oh, I don't know, maybe half
of the letters through the years.

17
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:23,166
Yeah, there's just-- It's just endless.

18
00:01:24,933 --> 00:01:27,300
I'm trying to get her to tell me the truth

19
00:01:27,366 --> 00:01:33,000
about a pizza deliveryman and a crime
that became FBI major case number 203.

20
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:38,933
I'm trying to prevent
your movie from being a flop.

21
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:43,566
I am not some evil genius
who was greedy and wanted some guy

22
00:01:43,633 --> 00:01:44,966
to rob a bank for me.

23
00:01:45,033 --> 00:01:48,433
I didn't have anything to do
with the goddamn crime!

25
00:01:59,466 --> 00:02:02,600
- 911, what's your emergency?
- We've been robbed.

26
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:05,533
- Okay, stay on the line.
- Okay.

27
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,633
- Is anyone hurt?
- No.

28
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:11,833
The guy walked out with
I don't know how much cash in a bag.

29
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,433
He had a bomb or something
wrapped around his neck.

30
00:02:14,933 --> 00:02:17,433
He's sitting in a parking lot
on upper Peach.

31
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,800
I'm watching him
out my rearview mirror.

32
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,733
The man told police that
the bomb had been strapped to his body

33
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,200
and that he was forced to rob the bank.

34
00:02:27,266 --> 00:02:30,400
Maybe you can get the keys?
To get out of this thing.

35
00:02:30,466 --> 00:02:32,433
I don't know if I have enough time.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,433
I'm not lying!

37
00:02:43,766 --> 00:02:45,933
It's gonna go off.

38
00:03:44,966 --> 00:03:46,333
My name is Lamont King.

39
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,366
A retired corporal with Pennsylvania
State Police, crime unit supervisor.

40
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:55,200
On the, uh, 28th of August...

41
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:57,233
...of, uh, 2003,

42
00:03:57,966 --> 00:04:02,066
uh, I was in my office, and received
information that the PNC Bank,

43
00:04:02,133 --> 00:04:03,966
located directly across here,

44
00:04:04,733 --> 00:04:08,900
uh, had been robbed by an individual
apparently wearing a collar bomb.

45
00:04:12,066 --> 00:04:16,500
Brian Wells walked into the bank with
a cane and the collar around his neck.

46
00:04:18,066 --> 00:04:22,400
We later learned that the, uh, cane,
it was actually a gun, a cane gun.

47
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,666
He handed the teller a note.

48
00:04:38,066 --> 00:04:42,733
The notes were nine pages.
They were quite rambling in places.

49
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,566
There were a couple that were
instructions for Brian. There were...

50
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:49,400
One that he was to give
to the bank manager.

51
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,300
One was for police.

52
00:05:01,366 --> 00:05:05,066
Bank notes are...
"I have a gun. Give me all your money."

53
00:05:05,133 --> 00:05:08,133
I mean, they're not usually dissertations

54
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,466
that are miles long.

55
00:05:29,733 --> 00:05:32,333
He had asked for $250,000.

56
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,466
In the end, all he got was what was
in the drawers, somewhere around $8,000.

57
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:50,133
He exited the bank,
stopped at McDonald's

58
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,633
and picked up apparently, a note.

59
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,766
Got his vehicle on the road,
proceeded to head south on Route 19,

60
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:04,400
which is Peach Street,
when our units arrived,

61
00:06:04,466 --> 00:06:06,966
at which time
our units spotted his vehicle

62
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:10,233
and pulled him over
in the Eyeglass World parking lot.

63
00:06:20,533 --> 00:06:23,133
I was assigned
to the patrol unit here in Erie,

64
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,966
and was riding my motorcycle.

65
00:06:25,033 --> 00:06:28,766
I was made aware of the situation
going on over on Peach Street.

66
00:06:31,133 --> 00:06:34,200
Police captured
Brian Wells, age 46,

67
00:06:34,266 --> 00:06:37,700
a pizza deliveryman,
just minutes after he left the bank.

68
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:41,900
We got him and handcuffed him.

69
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,266
And Brian said something about a bomb.

70
00:06:51,033 --> 00:06:55,066
It was Trooper Syzmanski who went up
and, using a small pair of scissors,

71
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,966
cut the sides of the shirt, because
whatever he had was underneath.

72
00:07:00,533 --> 00:07:03,200
When Syzmanski lifted the shirt, he goes:

73
00:07:03,266 --> 00:07:05,133
"Yeah, that looks like a bomb."

74
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:08,333
That's when they sat him down
to isolate him.

75
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,333
I'm gonna need a radio out here.

76
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,333
This guy's looking right at us.

77
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,166
Shoo them all over to 90.

78
00:07:17,866 --> 00:07:22,133
When I pulled up, the general
consensus is it was probably a fake bomb,

79
00:07:22,566 --> 00:07:25,100
but we never know,
so we act like it's real.

80
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:29,533
When I arrived, uh, he was already
on his knees, cuffed,

81
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:32,100
and he was talking calmly.

82
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:36,633
We were going back and forth with him
being a willing participant or a hostage.

83
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:40,000
Can you at least take these
freakin' handcuffs off?

84
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,733
I look through binoculars,
and he's talking.

85
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,633
He's nervous, but he's not
talking agitated. He's not agitated.

86
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,700
Why is it nobody's trying to come
to get this thing off of me?

87
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,866
He was concerned about
getting the collar off.

88
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:58,200
It's gonna go off!

89
00:07:59,533 --> 00:08:03,400
Soon as we believed we had
a bomb, the call went to Erie bomb squad.

90
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,933
It's just unfortunate that they were
probably over ten miles away.

91
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,566
And another unfortunate thing is that
in the process of protecting the public

92
00:08:12,966 --> 00:08:16,733
by closing down Peach Street,
we've now created a traffic problem

93
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,166
that the bomb squad
has to contend with this traffic.

94
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,133
-Did you call my boss?
-Yeah, we called him.

95
00:08:27,766 --> 00:08:30,500
We realized what pizza shop he worked at,

96
00:08:30,566 --> 00:08:33,333
and I sent two guys there
to conduct interviews.

97
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,733
Coworkers at Mama Mia's Pizzaria
saw Wells leave

98
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:41,900
to deliver two sausage and pepperoni pies
to a remote location,

99
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:44,300
an unoccupied radio tower.

100
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,866
He said black people, uh, jumped him
and put the collar around his neck.

101
00:08:50,933 --> 00:08:53,733
He pulled the key out and started a timer.

102
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,333
I heard the thing ticking when he did it.

103
00:08:57,066 --> 00:08:58,566
He never said who it was.

104
00:08:59,033 --> 00:09:03,933
He couldn't describe the black individuals
he claimed put the bomb around his neck.

105
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:09,333
You know there's probably
not a black person involved,

106
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,400
but that's what they're gonna say.

107
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:17,033
I was wondering if you guys could
get those instructions to go get the keys.

108
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,366
At that time, I start hearing a beep.

109
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:25,600
His whole demeanor changed.

110
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,566
Maybe you can get the keys?

111
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:29,133
To get out of this thing.

112
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,500
I don't know if I have enough time now.

113
00:09:31,566 --> 00:09:35,466
It's at that time that he realized
that it is a real bomb.

114
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,500
I'm not lying.

115
00:09:37,566 --> 00:09:40,400
I don't think he realized
until it started beeping.

116
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,333
...tell you where to get the keys.

117
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,766
Can you go to the next site in the car?

118
00:09:52,533 --> 00:09:54,966
-I don't have a lot of time.
-We're gonna have to...

119
00:09:55,033 --> 00:09:57,233
He was getting excited, and then

120
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,533
I kept hearing it. It, you know,
was going beep, beep.

121
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,666
I was zoomed in on his face.

122
00:10:05,966 --> 00:10:07,766
It's gonna go off!

123
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,100
I'm not lying!

124
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,800
His eyes just got real wide.

125
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:36,866
Then they went to the back of his head.
And that was the end of him.

126
00:10:43,433 --> 00:10:46,533
A few minutes ago,
I was looking in that direction.

127
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:50,166
The man was sitting there
as he was since about 3:00

128
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:54,233
when all of a sudden a loud explosion,
and he flipped onto his back,

129
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,300
and the police troopers scrambled.
They're still holding guns on him.

130
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,700
They're still not sure of his condition.

131
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:10,033
My name's Tom Stankiewicz.
On August 28th, 2003,

132
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,933
I was the bomb squad commander
for Erie Police.

133
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,900
Within about four blocks of our arrival,

134
00:11:17,966 --> 00:11:21,900
we received information over the radio
a bomb exploded on this suspect.

135
00:11:23,033 --> 00:11:25,866
He had still been breathing up until
a couple of...

136
00:11:25,933 --> 00:11:28,600
Really until the moment before
we had arrived.

137
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,966
We put on bomb suits, took up
the necessary equipment we might need.

138
00:11:36,433 --> 00:11:40,866
On approaching the person at the scene,
it was evident that he was deceased.

139
00:11:47,033 --> 00:11:51,633
The suspect still had
part of the device secured to his neck.

140
00:11:57,733 --> 00:12:01,833
We went through to make sure there were
no more explosive devices on him,

141
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:06,066
and searched his vehicle for any
potential further explosive devices.

142
00:12:25,866 --> 00:12:28,000
Brian was to go
on a scavenger hunt.

143
00:12:33,033 --> 00:12:36,733
He was supposed to go from
point A to point B to point C to point D

144
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,633
to get further instructions
to eventually lead him to a location

145
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,833
where the keys would be given
to release this bomb.

146
00:13:05,633 --> 00:13:09,633
He was following instructions
from the McDonald's to this site.

147
00:13:10,966 --> 00:13:14,466
Contacted the bomb squad.
They came in and swept the area.

148
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,933
The clue was sitting in the, uh--

149
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:24,400
In a coffee can,
maybe five or ten yards off the berm.

150
00:13:24,866 --> 00:13:28,700
Just to the right of this sign.
It's not too far from the sign.

151
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,766
From the drop-off point number one,
which was Interchange Road,

152
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:44,500
he was to go to his next drop-off point,
which was on 79 South,

153
00:13:44,566 --> 00:13:47,000
pretty close to the McKean Township exit.

154
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,266
Where we are is the second place
for the scavenger hunt

155
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,233
that he was directed to come to.

156
00:13:58,866 --> 00:14:02,233
What we found here
as we were looking for other items...

157
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,833
Uh, we found an orange tape sign
with "Vietnam" on it.

158
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,233
As we were looking in through here,

159
00:14:12,966 --> 00:14:15,733
I noticed way back on the other side
of that field

160
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:20,533
a minivan coming this way
and started to come towards us.

161
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,766
But it looked like he was coming to this
point also and we surprised him.

162
00:14:28,366 --> 00:14:31,666
And, uh, when he saw us,
he stopped for a while,

163
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,033
hesitated, backed up, and took off.

164
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:43,766
And he was so far away, we couldn't drive
up through here. He basically got away.

165
00:14:45,533 --> 00:14:49,833
It was like a, uh, blue type,
dirty blue type van.

166
00:14:51,233 --> 00:14:55,566
I figured whoever was responsible
for leaving the notes was in that van.

167
00:14:55,766 --> 00:14:58,433
Leaving the notes
at both the drop-off points.

168
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,600
Actually, that van always bothered me.

169
00:15:03,133 --> 00:15:04,266
Always bothered me.

170
00:15:06,233 --> 00:15:10,833
We did our preliminary investigation
and referred it right back to the FBI,

171
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,333
but the van was never mentioned again.

172
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:22,366
Initially when the call came in,
it was a state police case

173
00:15:22,433 --> 00:15:25,800
because we had had a crime
committed within our jurisdiction.

174
00:15:26,366 --> 00:15:30,633
And being a bank, federal investigators
would eventually be brought in.

175
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:36,766
Of course, there's always a brief
jurisdictional dispute.

176
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:40,566
ATF and the FBI and the state police,
everybody had a huddle.

177
00:15:40,633 --> 00:15:43,466
And they're like, "Whose case is this?"
ATF says,

178
00:15:43,533 --> 00:15:45,933
"We have jurisdiction
because it's an explosive device."

179
00:15:46,366 --> 00:15:48,533
Uh, state police said,
"This was on our turf."

180
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,966
FBI said, "No, this is a bank
robbery case, which the FBI handles."

181
00:15:52,033 --> 00:15:56,700
They went back and forth a bit. Turned out
that the FBI was gonna take point,

182
00:15:56,766 --> 00:15:59,200
assisted by the state police and the ATF.

183
00:16:01,533 --> 00:16:02,933
My name is Jerry Clark.

184
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:07,800
I was the lead investigator
as a special agent for the FBI.

185
00:16:09,466 --> 00:16:12,533
Night of the bombing,
I drafted an affidavit with the, uh,

186
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,233
U.S. Attorney's office,

187
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,466
and we executed a search warrant
at Brian Wells' residence.

188
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,866
We made entry into Mr. Wells' residence
using an explosive breach,

189
00:16:25,633 --> 00:16:28,533
because we weren't sure
what we were gonna find.

190
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,000
Once inside, we didn't find a whole lot.

191
00:16:35,966 --> 00:16:39,400
But we did find interesting things,
including an address book

192
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:43,200
that had the names and telephone numbers
of some local prostitutes.

193
00:16:45,233 --> 00:16:49,366
We never did find any physical evidence
that linked him to the bombing.

194
00:16:57,966 --> 00:17:01,666
It was 3 in the morning
by the time we transported him back

195
00:17:01,733 --> 00:17:03,233
to the coroner's office.

196
00:17:04,533 --> 00:17:06,500
We started discussing the collar.

197
00:17:09,033 --> 00:17:11,733
It was the primary
piece of evidence at the time.

198
00:17:12,033 --> 00:17:17,500
Uh, and, of course, uh, the other agencies
didn't want that disrupted very much.

199
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:23,333
It said in the note the collar was
booby-trapped, but my concern was safety.

200
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,099
That's when the decision was made
to do a, uh,

201
00:17:26,766 --> 00:17:30,333
essentially a surgical decapitation
of the body.

202
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,033
In order for them to remove the device,

203
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,066
they had to actually cut
his head off to remove it.

204
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,633
It was, probably still is,

205
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,900
the most difficult decision
I've ever made.

206
00:17:45,633 --> 00:17:47,900
It was done in a way that was, uh...

207
00:17:49,266 --> 00:17:53,400
I mean, it's difficult to describe,
but it was done in a very, uh...

208
00:17:54,933 --> 00:17:55,800
caring way.

209
00:18:03,066 --> 00:18:07,100
43-year-old Brian Wells, who
lived in a nice Mill Creek neighborhood,

210
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:11,666
was described by neighbors as very
friendly, very nice, almost childlike.

211
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,700
My name is Linda Payne,
and Brian lived in this little house.

212
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:21,700
And he was a good renter.

213
00:18:22,533 --> 00:18:25,766
He did have three cats
that he kept inside all the time.

214
00:18:26,133 --> 00:18:29,800
Once in a while, he'd carry one out.
He was pretty even-tempered.

215
00:18:30,266 --> 00:18:32,633
Uh, if he did get excited,
he danced a little.

216
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,933
It was just the way he was. You know.

217
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:41,866
Sometimes he would take his mother
to the movies.

218
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:46,500
If there was a free concert,
he'd take his mother and her friend.

219
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:51,400
He liked scavenger hunts,
the key hunt in the paper.

220
00:18:52,766 --> 00:18:56,866
They put clues in the paper every day,
and it would be some landmark place

221
00:18:56,933 --> 00:18:59,466
around the county that the key would be.

222
00:19:01,366 --> 00:19:05,100
Once he got close but missed it
by a little bit and didn't get it.

223
00:19:05,566 --> 00:19:07,600
So he was disappointed about that.

224
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,200
They might have made the scavenger hunt
because they knew he liked them.

225
00:19:18,966 --> 00:19:23,733
The description of Mr. Wells
in the bank was very calm.

226
00:19:24,133 --> 00:19:28,233
Actually stood on line for a second
before he decided to go around

227
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,733
one of the customers in the bank
to hand the teller a note.

228
00:19:32,233 --> 00:19:35,666
Actually reached into the basket
to pull out a lollipop.

229
00:19:36,733 --> 00:19:40,133
Why would you feel comfortable
enough and take a lollipop?

230
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,933
Why would you, as the witness described,
walk out of the bank like Charlie Chaplin,

231
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,500
swinging the bag and the cane gun?

232
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,900
Why or how could an individual

233
00:19:52,966 --> 00:19:57,366
who knew they had a live device
around their neck be so calm?

234
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,200
I didn't think that he was involved.
I thought, he-- They...

235
00:20:03,266 --> 00:20:05,266
He might be easy to, um...

236
00:20:06,766 --> 00:20:08,400
uh, influence.

237
00:20:09,066 --> 00:20:12,800
I thought it'd be easy to grab him
and put the collar bomb on.

238
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:23,766
The call was made
to the pizza delivery shop at 1:30.

239
00:20:25,866 --> 00:20:30,466
We determined that came from the Shell
station not far from the delivery site.

240
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:38,400
Mr. Tony Ditomo, the owner of the
pizza shop, initially took the call.

241
00:20:39,266 --> 00:20:41,766
And he was talking to that person,

242
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:47,300
and he was having trouble understanding,
so he handed the phone to Brian Wells,

243
00:20:47,366 --> 00:20:50,200
and Brian Wells wrote his own directions

244
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,400
to the tower where the pizzas
were to be delivered.

245
00:20:55,866 --> 00:20:58,100
Could this dirt road
be the fateful spot

246
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:01,533
where Wells met the person or persons
who would end his life?

247
00:21:02,633 --> 00:21:05,933
This secluded site
is the last delivery spot for Wells.

248
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,300
Now the question is, was the man forced
to rob the bank by someone else?

249
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:21,266
We found and recovered,
through the Pennsylvania State Police,

250
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:25,400
who did a fantastic job
in evidence recovery, tire impressions

251
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,500
that indicated that Brian Wells' vehicle
was at this site.

252
00:21:31,866 --> 00:21:33,733
We also had shoe impressions.

253
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:38,666
Mr. Wells' shoe, his sneaker,
that indicated that he was at this site.

254
00:21:39,033 --> 00:21:41,266
All right? And we had a scuff mark,

255
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:45,000
uh, right in the, uh, this area right here

256
00:21:45,066 --> 00:21:49,033
that indicated that there was some
sort of struggle that had ensued.

257
00:21:56,833 --> 00:22:01,433
A case of this size, you would think
that somewhere in the pieces recovered

258
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,900
you'd have some evidence
that could be used forensically.

259
00:22:05,633 --> 00:22:10,933
We took every step we could
to develop DNA,

260
00:22:11,266 --> 00:22:15,400
fingerprints, any forensic evidence
that we could use to compare,

261
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:19,133
and we just didn't have much luck
with that in this case.

262
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:34,833
Good morning.

263
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,666
My name is Jean Heid.

264
00:22:38,633 --> 00:22:40,933
I'm one of Brian Wells' three sisters.

265
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,766
I first heard about the suffering
and death of my brother, Brian,

266
00:22:50,033 --> 00:22:51,033
on the news.

267
00:22:52,633 --> 00:22:53,933
Brian was handcuffed.

268
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,966
The officers continued to point their guns
at him,

269
00:22:58,533 --> 00:23:02,233
even though he was fully cooperating
in their custody.

270
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,433
And why was no ambulance present
to try to help

271
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,333
when he laid dying upon the ground,
grasping for life?

272
00:23:14,066 --> 00:23:17,533
The decision was made
to cut off Brian's head...

273
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:20,500
to preserve the collar bomb.

274
00:23:21,766 --> 00:23:25,000
This beheading of Brian...

275
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,900
took from us the closure we sought

276
00:23:28,966 --> 00:23:32,066
by being able to view Brian
at his funeral.

277
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,966
Tears streamed down Mom's face
as she learned the news

278
00:23:37,033 --> 00:23:40,066
that Brian's body was not fit
for open-casket viewing.

279
00:23:41,466 --> 00:23:44,533
The removed head could not be supported
in position.

280
00:23:46,433 --> 00:23:49,233
More respect was shown
for the destructive device

281
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,833
than for Brian's body.

282
00:23:56,233 --> 00:23:57,900
As a kindhearted listener,

283
00:23:58,866 --> 00:24:03,100
Brian touched our lives
in so many beautiful ways

284
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:06,000
by his humble and quiet presence,

285
00:24:06,566 --> 00:24:11,066
and his devoted, selfless care
and service for our family.

286
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,633
We believe that what happened
to Brian was monstrous.

287
00:24:21,366 --> 00:24:24,533
The absence of clarity and truth
in the investigation

288
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,066
has been a horrendous ordeal
for our entire family.

289
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:41,933
Erie has its share, for
a small town, of kind of bizarre events.

290
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,366
We've had a number of things happen.

291
00:24:44,433 --> 00:24:46,033
But there is nothing

292
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:49,533
that captured the imagination
of the public,

293
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,433
that raised so many questions,
that was just so...

294
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:55,933
sincerely bizarre as this case.

295
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,600
It's a bank robbery, but a scavenger hunt,
a guy has a cane gun, and it was loaded.

296
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:09,133
He had the Guess shirt on.
You know, "Guess what this is."

297
00:25:10,866 --> 00:25:15,166
It took on this mythic proportion,
'cause it just kept getting weirder.

298
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,400
This is a Fox News alert.
Breaking news tonight

299
00:25:20,466 --> 00:25:23,000
in the so-called Pizza Bomber mystery.

300
00:25:23,066 --> 00:25:25,900
There is a twist
in a bizarre bank-robbery story

301
00:25:25,966 --> 00:25:27,433
in Erie, Pennsylvania.

302
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:31,333
The captured bank robber had a bomb
on him. Now he's dead.

303
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,733
And so was a coworker, who also died

304
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,700
under mysterious circumstances.

305
00:25:36,866 --> 00:25:40,133
The second incident occurred
on Sunday, August 31st,

306
00:25:40,533 --> 00:25:43,966
when a coworker and friend of Wells,
Robert Thomas Pinetti,

307
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,166
was discovered unresponsive
by family members.

308
00:25:48,466 --> 00:25:51,800
As the story developed,
and they learned who it was

309
00:25:51,866 --> 00:25:56,100
and his relationship with
the pizza business and Mr. Wells--

310
00:25:56,166 --> 00:25:58,900
So, when they got that,
they pulled back.

311
00:25:58,966 --> 00:26:00,866
Again, a perimeter was set up.

312
00:26:01,366 --> 00:26:04,466
There was no signs
of any pathologic condition he had,

313
00:26:04,533 --> 00:26:06,633
like a stroke or a heart attack...

314
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,066
or anything along those lines.

315
00:26:09,633 --> 00:26:12,500
Similar scenario to Mr. Wells, he was...

316
00:26:12,933 --> 00:26:15,833
transported to our office
and an autopsy was done.

317
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:19,266
Officials hope an autopsy
reveals the cause of that death

318
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:23,400
and helps determine whether
the strange fates of the two pizza workers

319
00:26:23,466 --> 00:26:24,933
are somehow connected.

320
00:26:28,066 --> 00:26:31,366
I was on the task force
that we worked with the PSP.

321
00:26:31,433 --> 00:26:34,566
A lot of the FBI, a lot of the ATF.

322
00:26:34,633 --> 00:26:37,333
There were Erie city officers
assigned to it.

323
00:26:39,666 --> 00:26:44,433
Well, Bob Pinetti was an important subject
in the investigation,

324
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,633
because he changed his actions
right after it occurred.

325
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,766
He got nervous. He was going around.

326
00:26:49,833 --> 00:26:53,733
We have interviews where he was looking
for some type of protection

327
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,700
'cause he thought they were coming
after him next.

328
00:26:57,733 --> 00:27:00,933
Initially, Mr. Pinetti was going

329
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,133
to be interviewed by investigators,
and they had met

330
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,900
with him at the pizza shop.

331
00:27:06,866 --> 00:27:09,200
Mr. Pinetti was working a shift

332
00:27:09,266 --> 00:27:11,900
and asked if he could move his interview

333
00:27:11,966 --> 00:27:13,333
until Monday.

334
00:27:14,866 --> 00:27:16,500
Well, as it turned out,

335
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,266
Monday never came for investigators
because...

336
00:27:20,866 --> 00:27:22,533
he died that Sunday evening.

337
00:27:23,866 --> 00:27:26,500
He did appear to have
a drug issue.

338
00:27:27,066 --> 00:27:32,066
That's something that's not uncommon
in the Erie area. It's a plague right now,

339
00:27:32,133 --> 00:27:36,366
with all the ODs, with heroin, the pills,
and those types of things.

340
00:27:36,433 --> 00:27:40,800
And could it be that this added anxiety
from this investigation--?

341
00:27:40,866 --> 00:27:44,033
His buddy just got a bomb strapped on him
and blew up.

342
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:48,433
I get worked up, more drugs to take
the edge off, and accidentally OD.

343
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,133
Now you have

344
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:54,033
a second pizza deliveryman
who has also died.

345
00:27:54,533 --> 00:27:58,066
Did he play a role in this?

346
00:27:58,133 --> 00:28:01,633
Did he help set Brian up to deliver
that pizza on that day?

347
00:28:06,133 --> 00:28:07,800
The multi-agency task force

348
00:28:07,866 --> 00:28:10,866
investigating the robbery and the death
of the robber

349
00:28:10,933 --> 00:28:13,233
is considering three scenarios.

350
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:17,533
One, that 46-year-old Brian Wells
committed the robbery on his own.

351
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,066
But why would he use a live bomb?

352
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:23,966
The second scenario,
Wells was abducted by others.

353
00:28:24,033 --> 00:28:26,366
Told he had 20 minutes to rob the bank

354
00:28:26,433 --> 00:28:29,600
and get back, or the bomb
they attached would go off.

355
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:34,766
Third, that Wells and fellow employee,
43-year-old Robert Pinetti,

356
00:28:34,833 --> 00:28:38,500
- planned the robbery together.
- I did know that he would go

357
00:28:38,566 --> 00:28:41,600
with Pinetti to do some gambling.

358
00:28:41,666 --> 00:28:46,700
I figured, maybe he could have
needed money enough to rob a bank.

359
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:52,233
Robert was a very gentle fellow,
and he wasn't out to hurt anybody.

360
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,733
And he wouldn't do that.

361
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:58,100
Pinetti, whose health is
clearly failing, says her son is innocent.

362
00:28:58,166 --> 00:29:00,100
It makes me feel really bad.

363
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,700
Really bad, when you know
that it's not true. You know?

364
00:29:06,366 --> 00:29:09,566
That's what hurts.
He didn't have anything to do with it.

365
00:29:10,933 --> 00:29:14,600
As for Robert Pinetti,
the coworker of Wells who was found dead,

366
00:29:14,666 --> 00:29:16,633
an autopsy has been completed.

367
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:21,900
Preliminary results show, perhaps,
either an accidental overdose or suicide.

368
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,100
Now we have two dead pizza delivery
guys, and the city's feeling shocked.

369
00:29:29,166 --> 00:29:30,533
How could this happen?

370
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,833
You know, who's the mastermind?
Because this made worldwide news.

371
00:29:35,333 --> 00:29:39,433
Was this a robbery gone
wrong, or a sadistic public execution?

372
00:29:47,166 --> 00:29:50,100
We had a few investigative teams
in operation.

373
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,900
We knew
that Mr. Wells frequented prostitutes.

374
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:02,100
We had a prostitute team,
due to the fact that Mr. Wells had

375
00:30:02,166 --> 00:30:05,066
the prostitutes' names in a notebook.

376
00:30:06,233 --> 00:30:11,433
We began to run out one potential
suspect at the time that may have had

377
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:15,300
knowledge because he was the boyfriend
of one of the prostitutes.

378
00:30:17,266 --> 00:30:21,666
He had a history of some military
background with explosives,

379
00:30:21,733 --> 00:30:26,400
that was African-American, that had been
working on a special project at work,

380
00:30:26,466 --> 00:30:29,900
utilizing the equipment,
would shut the door to the room.

381
00:30:29,966 --> 00:30:32,566
We had information
that looked interesting.

382
00:30:32,633 --> 00:30:36,933
And, again, you can't discount
what Mr. Wells had said early,

383
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,633
though investigators felt,
"It's not accurate."

384
00:30:41,233 --> 00:30:44,900
But we actually found no evidence
to connect him to the case.

385
00:30:48,566 --> 00:30:53,366
We had a second team that we called
the Mama Mia's Pizzaria team,

386
00:30:53,433 --> 00:30:56,400
to investigate one disgruntled
former employee

387
00:30:57,233 --> 00:31:01,833
who had actually threatened, uh, the owner
of the pizza shop, Mr. Ditomo.

388
00:31:02,433 --> 00:31:05,800
And we later determined
that he had a good alibi

389
00:31:05,866 --> 00:31:10,200
and that it was not related to this case.

390
00:31:13,933 --> 00:31:17,500
We are hopeful
that by showing a picture of the device...

391
00:31:18,533 --> 00:31:21,766
...someone may have or may recognize...

392
00:31:22,766 --> 00:31:24,933
the instrument, the metal,

393
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,300
the locking material used to secure it

394
00:31:27,366 --> 00:31:31,133
- to the neck.
- Members gave the public

395
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,633
its first look at the cane shotgun used
in the robbery. For the first time,

396
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:40,466
those investigators admitted the gun
was loaded and would have fired.

397
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:42,466
It has been tested,

398
00:31:42,966 --> 00:31:44,800
and it does function properly.

399
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,566
It is constructed from wood and metal.

400
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,300
That's important. FBI profilers
believe that whoever built the gun

401
00:31:54,366 --> 00:31:58,666
and the collar is a handyman
competent with wood and metal.

402
00:31:58,733 --> 00:32:01,233
He probably collects or makes weapons,

403
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:04,766
and may have other cane guns
that he's shown to others.

404
00:32:05,633 --> 00:32:09,833
He is patient, they say,
and deceptive and secretive.

405
00:32:10,633 --> 00:32:12,000
Being in control

406
00:32:12,066 --> 00:32:14,400
is very important for him.

407
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:18,600
Through his words,
attempts to tightly control

408
00:32:18,666 --> 00:32:22,866
the actions of Brian Wells,
as well as law enforcement.

409
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:27,766
My name is Jason Wick.

410
00:32:27,833 --> 00:32:31,166
Uh, I work for ATF.
I've been with ATF for 25 years.

411
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,233
I had the opportunity to be a part
of the evidence collection team

412
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,300
at the World Trade Center bombing.

413
00:32:37,833 --> 00:32:41,633
Uh, and an evidence collection team
on 9/11 in Shanksville,

414
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,833
where United Flight 93 crashed.

415
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:45,900
Without a doubt,

416
00:32:45,966 --> 00:32:50,000
this case trumps all others
as far as how bizarre it was.

417
00:32:51,766 --> 00:32:56,700
We had the device put back together.
Problem was, we couldn't match any tools.

418
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,100
Again, as made very public by Ted
Kaczynski in the Unabomber case,

419
00:33:01,166 --> 00:33:05,233
bomb makers throw their tools away.
They try not to purchase materials.

420
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,933
That's what happened here.

421
00:33:07,833 --> 00:33:11,066
It was going to be
a long-term investigation, not short.

422
00:33:12,133 --> 00:33:13,333
Part of our role

423
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:17,000
as bomb technicians is
to thoroughly go through the scene,

424
00:33:17,066 --> 00:33:21,766
and collect all the debris and determine
what is part of the device and what isn't.

425
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:26,200
In this case, we easily captured
90-some percent of the components.

426
00:33:29,233 --> 00:33:32,266
From all the components
recovered at the scene,

427
00:33:32,333 --> 00:33:36,900
I was able to assemble what I believe is
an accurate replica of that device.

428
00:33:39,166 --> 00:33:43,833
The neck cuff would have operated like
a standard handcuff in that, when closed,

429
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,766
it would ratchet and lock.

430
00:33:45,833 --> 00:33:49,600
The case and the collar itself would
have taken

431
00:33:49,666 --> 00:33:53,200
somebody some time,
probably on the order of a month

432
00:33:53,266 --> 00:33:56,133
in their spare time to assemble this.

433
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:01,333
The first timer attached
to the first bomb

434
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,533
was probably activated
by the release of a cotter pin.

435
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,900
There's a second cotter pin on there.

436
00:34:06,966 --> 00:34:10,666
If that pin was pulled,
it would've given Mr. Wells another hour.

437
00:34:12,333 --> 00:34:15,833
An extension is put
on the handle and it merely swings around

438
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:18,733
and closes the contact
when it gets down to zero.

439
00:34:20,866 --> 00:34:24,100
The one thing that sticks out was
all of the red herrings

440
00:34:24,166 --> 00:34:26,300
that were incorporated into the device.

441
00:34:26,366 --> 00:34:30,199
Um, that was, in my opinion,
in the investigative team's opinion,

442
00:34:30,266 --> 00:34:33,666
designed to prevent the bomb squad
from tampering with it.

443
00:34:34,133 --> 00:34:36,633
There were wires
that didn't mean anything.

444
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:40,000
There was a plastic cell phone
that didn't mean anything.

445
00:34:40,433 --> 00:34:43,166
The device was fairly sophisticated,
although,

446
00:34:43,233 --> 00:34:46,366
in the end, it was just two pipe bombs
and two timers.

447
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,100
Interesting thing
about it was,

448
00:34:49,166 --> 00:34:51,866
the number of warning labels
that were on it.

449
00:34:51,933 --> 00:34:56,233
And it almost mirrored the instructions
that were given to Wells

450
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,166
in that they were overly wordy.

451
00:34:58,633 --> 00:35:00,966
It was a lot of info
that would have been distracting

452
00:35:01,033 --> 00:35:04,266
for somebody to take in
as they're trying to figure it out.

453
00:35:04,333 --> 00:35:07,466
It alluded to a lot of different types
of booby traps

454
00:35:07,533 --> 00:35:09,666
being activated by a cell phone,

455
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:11,433
the wire being a booby trap.

456
00:35:12,033 --> 00:35:14,633
There were a lot of warnings,
to that effect.

457
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,600
We're hoping to gain leads on where
the componentry came from.

458
00:35:20,566 --> 00:35:24,200
We tried to determine where those items
may have been purchased.

459
00:35:24,266 --> 00:35:27,633
We tried to ascertain tool marks,
things of that nature.

460
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,400
That was the biggest problem.
We couldn't match anything.

461
00:35:33,366 --> 00:35:35,200
The back plate was scored,

462
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:37,866
basically cut, I guess,
with a cutting tool,

463
00:35:37,933 --> 00:35:39,500
to cause shrapnel effect.

464
00:35:39,566 --> 00:35:42,066
It was cut into a form of a checkerboard.

465
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,100
It didn't shrapnel, I believe,

466
00:35:46,166 --> 00:35:49,966
as the builder intended.
It did fracture, but it didn't shrapnel.

467
00:35:50,033 --> 00:35:53,933
It didn't blow into pieces,
meaning the scoring wasn't deep enough.

468
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,266
However, it did cause

469
00:35:55,866 --> 00:35:58,733
a severe wound in Mr. Wells's chest,
an inch deep,

470
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,466
maybe 8-by-10 inches square,
which ultimately killed him.

471
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,766
Task force members say
the bomb that killed Wells

472
00:36:06,833 --> 00:36:10,533
was common, but that the collar
was unique, with four key locks

473
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,466
and a tumbler lock.

474
00:36:12,533 --> 00:36:14,500
It had only one purpose:

475
00:36:14,566 --> 00:36:17,400
To hold a bomb around a human neck.

476
00:36:18,633 --> 00:36:21,366
Of the four keyholes,
there were only two locks

477
00:36:21,433 --> 00:36:23,100
keeping the device locked.

478
00:36:23,166 --> 00:36:25,533
If he would've recovered two of the keys,

479
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,166
he could've unlocked it,
but I don't believe

480
00:36:28,233 --> 00:36:32,733
he was ever going to find those keys.
I believe he was meant to die that day.

481
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:45,533
The scavenger hunt,
that whole game playing, that whole:

482
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,100
"Let's control the situation.
Let's send the police on a sideshow."

483
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:53,766
Yeah, I thought the scavenger hunt
was a red herring.

484
00:36:53,833 --> 00:36:54,966
It was a diversion.

485
00:36:56,433 --> 00:36:59,300
Investigators wanted to determine

486
00:36:59,366 --> 00:37:04,366
if we had time to trace the route
that Wells was to actually go through.

487
00:37:04,433 --> 00:37:09,533
And we actually got in the vehicle,
same time of day, same day of the week,

488
00:37:10,066 --> 00:37:11,933
same weather conditions,

489
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,533
and drove the route.

490
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,466
Erie County is the smokestack

491
00:37:17,533 --> 00:37:19,500
on the corner of Pennsylvania.

492
00:37:19,566 --> 00:37:22,700
It gives Pennsylvania its access
to the Great Lakes.

493
00:37:22,766 --> 00:37:26,966
Water on one side, New York State
to the other, Ohio to the other side.

494
00:37:27,033 --> 00:37:30,233
Banks on upper Peach Tree are near
the I-90 Interstate,

495
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,266
where you can be in one
of two different states in 20 minutes.

496
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:37,433
The way to rob a bank in Erie County

497
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,933
is to switch vehicles,
rob it in one vehicle, switch vehicles,

498
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,433
get on the interstate, be in another state
in 20 minutes, avoiding detection.

499
00:37:46,466 --> 00:37:49,933
Here were people that put
this complex scavenger-hunt thing,

500
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,700
where you go around in this big circle,

501
00:37:52,766 --> 00:37:55,833
and go round and round in circles
near the crime site.

502
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:00,633
To whom does that make sense?
Doesn't make sense to anyone.

503
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,766
It was determined that Brian Wells

504
00:38:05,833 --> 00:38:08,566
could've not finished the route,

505
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:12,666
in time, before the detonation
of that device.

506
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:20,766
The FBI released parts of
the letter, in hopes of getting a reaction

507
00:38:20,833 --> 00:38:25,400
from the public, hoping they recognize
the handwriting or linguistic skills.

508
00:38:27,566 --> 00:38:30,333
Of course we tried
to match the writing.

509
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,066
And I think, early on,
it was fairly agreed upon that

510
00:38:34,133 --> 00:38:38,200
notes looked like they were typed
and traced from a typed piece of paper.

511
00:38:38,266 --> 00:38:42,500
Look at the margins, the indentation.
They're consistent with a typewriter.

512
00:38:42,566 --> 00:38:45,100
Matching handwriting was not going
to happen.

513
00:38:45,166 --> 00:38:48,566
The best lead we had from the notes
was indented writing.

514
00:38:48,633 --> 00:38:50,833
Lab workers
lifted these images,

515
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,566
pressed into instructions
found in Wells' car,

516
00:38:53,633 --> 00:38:58,033
probably by the crime's mastermind
writing over the notes on other paper.

517
00:38:59,233 --> 00:39:03,500
We had some phone numbers, and we had
some writing that the lab discovered

518
00:39:03,566 --> 00:39:08,400
through their examination that, again,
were pretty good leads, but led nowhere.

519
00:39:10,566 --> 00:39:13,866
Only 2 or 3 percent
of bank robberies are done

520
00:39:13,933 --> 00:39:16,200
with any kind of explosive device.

521
00:39:16,266 --> 00:39:17,700
And of those,

522
00:39:17,766 --> 00:39:21,600
only a very small, less than 1 percent,
is done with a live device.

523
00:39:24,766 --> 00:39:28,700
We have had instances
where individuals, um...

524
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:32,366
state that they do have
an explosive device or a bomb.

525
00:39:32,433 --> 00:39:35,233
However, certainly, this is the first time

526
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:38,700
that a device has actually, uh, exploded.

527
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:43,433
I've never seen a device strapped
around anybody's neck.

528
00:39:44,933 --> 00:39:48,933
We've heard of fake devices,
people coming into banks,

529
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,966
or going into businesses
with fake devices, saying, "I have a bomb.

530
00:39:53,033 --> 00:39:54,833
Please comply with my demands."

531
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,900
Um, but never wrapped
around somebody's neck.

532
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:03,933
The reason this case was elevated
to FBI major case number 203,

533
00:40:04,333 --> 00:40:07,933
something like this had never happened
in the history of the FBI

534
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,533
where a potential hostage is sent
into the bank

535
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:18,500
with a device, ordered to rob the bank,
and the device detonates,

536
00:40:18,566 --> 00:40:21,233
resulting in death.
This had never happened.

537
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:25,266
Somebody murdered Brian Wells that day.

538
00:40:25,766 --> 00:40:28,900
Whether he was involved or not,
it's still a murder.

539
00:40:32,633 --> 00:40:36,000
FBI profilers
from the Behavioral Analysis Unit say

540
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:39,666
the plan's mastermind,
a person they call "Collar Bomber,"

541
00:40:39,733 --> 00:40:42,733
may have had Wells' death in mind
all along.

542
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:47,166
The end result ended in the murder
and death of Brian Wells,

543
00:40:47,233 --> 00:40:50,166
and, uh, again, according to BAU, um...

544
00:40:50,966 --> 00:40:55,433
that is probably, in their opinion,
one of the motives in the case.

545
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:59,533
Also released, more details
about Collar Bomber from the profilers,

546
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:04,433
saying that the person involved is frugal,
a pack rat who might save scrap metal,

547
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:08,200
is mechanically inclined,
could hide a violent nature...

548
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:13,400
There was a lot of tips coming in,
but nothing that was a smoking gun.

549
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,000
And then it fizzled out.

550
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,233
This case did not have
a lot of forensic evidence.

551
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:29,666
This case was gonna involve somebody
spilling a secret, quite honestly.

552
00:41:29,733 --> 00:41:32,300
It was gonna involve somebody coming out

553
00:41:32,366 --> 00:41:35,900
and saying, "I have some information
that can help you."

554
00:41:47,066 --> 00:41:50,200
The second thing to know
about Marjorie Diehl-Armstrong,

555
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,633
she's smart.

556
00:41:52,666 --> 00:41:54,333
But she's also mentally ill.

557
00:41:56,066 --> 00:41:59,400
When Marge was 23,
she took herself to see a therapist

558
00:41:59,466 --> 00:42:01,133
because she was scared.

559
00:42:01,766 --> 00:42:03,433
Something was wrong with her mind.

560
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,533
She told the doctor

561
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:10,566
she was most sad about her inability
to have close, gratifying relationships.

562
00:42:12,666 --> 00:42:16,633
Over the years, Marjorie's been seen
by numerous experts

563
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,633
who diagnosed several conditions:

564
00:42:19,066 --> 00:42:20,066
Bipolar.

565
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,200
Mania.

566
00:42:22,266 --> 00:42:23,500
Pressured speech.

567
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:29,133
One psychiatrist suggested
Marjorie wasn't mentally ill.

568
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:33,033
She just suffered from narcissism
and a severe personality disorder.

569
00:42:34,166 --> 00:42:36,933
Regardless,
Marjorie couldn't hold down a job.

570
00:42:37,366 --> 00:42:40,800
She struggled with daily life,
started to let herself go.

571
00:42:42,066 --> 00:42:45,733
In one of her therapy sessions,
she sighed and told the doctor:

572
00:42:46,133 --> 00:42:48,633
"I used to be the prettiest girl in town."

573
00:42:50,933 --> 00:42:53,766
The third thing you need to know
about Marjorie:

574
00:42:55,066 --> 00:42:58,466
Most of the men in her life don't seem
to last very long.

575
00:43:00,666 --> 00:43:03,633
For example, the one time
she was briefly married,

576
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,133
her husband, Richard Armstrong,

577
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,533
died after he fell and hit his head
on their coffee table.

578
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:15,433
Marge sued the hospital for negligence
and won a $175,000 settlement.

579
00:43:16,633 --> 00:43:21,066
Before her husband was buried,
Marge asked for a piece of his leg bone,

580
00:43:21,566 --> 00:43:24,566
in case she might be able
to clone him in the future.

581
00:43:25,033 --> 00:43:27,633
And then there are
the other dead boyfriends.

582
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,900
One hung himself after she moved out.

583
00:43:30,366 --> 00:43:34,133
There are at least five men in her life

584
00:43:34,733 --> 00:43:39,200
that died prematurely
of either strange circumstances

585
00:43:39,266 --> 00:43:41,433
or by outright violence.

586
00:43:45,566 --> 00:43:47,733
State Police,
what's your emergency?

587
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:53,266
At 8645 Peach Street, in the garage,
there is a frozen body,

588
00:43:53,333 --> 00:43:58,233
it's in the freezer. There's a woman there
you might wanna pick up and question.

589
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:01,100
- 8645 Peach Street?
- Yes.

590
00:44:01,166 --> 00:44:03,000
How do you know that, sir?

591
00:44:03,466 --> 00:44:05,333
- Trust me. I know.
- Who are you?

592
00:44:06,266 --> 00:44:09,033
- I'm the guy who lives there.
- What is your name, sir?

593
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,100
Bill... Rothstein...

594
00:44:18,033 --> 00:44:21,366
- And what is her name?
- Marjorie... Diehl.

595
00:44:21,433 --> 00:44:22,866
D-I-E-H-L.

596
00:44:22,933 --> 00:44:26,133
- Marjorie Diehl is at that residence now?
- Yes.

597
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,066
Who is she to you, sir?

598
00:44:28,133 --> 00:44:31,700
Uh... I'll give you guys
my story later on.

599
00:44:32,433 --> 00:44:34,800
There's a frozen body in the freezer?

600
00:44:34,866 --> 00:44:36,566
In the garage,
that is correct.

601
00:44:36,633 --> 00:44:38,933
Do you know who the person is
in the freezer?

602
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:39,933
Uh...
