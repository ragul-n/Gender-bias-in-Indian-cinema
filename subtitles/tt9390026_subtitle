1
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:40,583
Tell Dr. Suman
Inspector Shekhawat is here to see her.

2
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:41,500
Okay.

3
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:45,000
Who is it?

4
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:47,750
DCP Shekhawat is here to see you.

5
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:49,125
Send him in.

6
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:12,500
Yes?

7
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:15,208
Dr. Suman,
I came here to assure you that...

8
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,791
we're trying our best,
but we still can't find Dr. Asthana.

9
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,500
Is that why you are here?

10
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,375
I've already read that in the newspaper.

11
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:30,041
You've been repeating the same line
for the past 11 days.

12
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:32,458
I don't think you'll ever find Dr. Anil.

13
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:39,333
Your anger is justified.

14
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:42,916
But we still don't know
which route Dr. Asthana took

15
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,916
to travel from
Mumbai to Mahabaleshwar.

16
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:49,666
We've completed our basic investigation,
but we've yet to find a clue.

17
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,458
But Mrs. Suman, I assure you

18
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:56,875
we'll leave no stone unturned
while investigating this case.

19
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:03,083
But in case you find out anything,

20
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:05,291
please inform us too.

21
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,625
Yes.

22
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:12,291
You do have my phone number.

23
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,833
Yeah.

24
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:25,625
Missing

25
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:35,666
<span style="style.default_1">A prominent surgeon and the owner</span>
<span style="style.default_1">of the multispecialty hospital,</span>

26
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,375
<span style="style.default_1">Dr. Anil Asthana is still missing.</span>

29
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:51,958
ZX Hospital CEO office.

30
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,083
-Reena, this is Suman.
<span style="style.default_1">-Yes, ma'am.</span>

31
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:57,333
I'll be coming to work from today.

32
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,916
I feel very restless at home.

33
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,083
So keep my room ready, okay?

34
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,166
Reena, please send Kamath in.

35
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:23,166
Mr. Kamath, Dr. Suman's here
and she wants to see you.

36
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:37,000
How are you?

37
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:45,583
Any news about the doctor?

38
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,166
DCP Shekhawat came over in the morning.

39
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,708
He assured me he's trying.

40
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,875
They are all useless, Kamath.

41
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:03,041
It's been 11 days,
but they couldn't find one man.

42
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,291
Kamath, since Dr. Anil's disappearance...

43
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,708
I can't focus on anything.

44
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,625
Don't worry, ma'am.

45
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,500
Anything else?

46
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,375
Nothing else, ma'am. See you.

47
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,041
Please check this file.

48
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,333
A 12-year-old boy, Neeraj.

49
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:47,250
His father's been waiting
for you for ten days.

50
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,625
We had discharged the boy.

51
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:53,791
But he isn't ready to leave the hospital
without consulting you first.

52
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:56,375
What's wrong with him?

53
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,083
He's normal.

54
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,541
If he's normal,
why does he want to meet me?

55
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:04,166
The boy isn't normal,
but his reports are.

56
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,791
For the last ten days,
he's been having convulsions.

57
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,250
His entire body starts shaking violently.

58
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:14,708
All his reports, blood pressure,
MRI scans, everything is normal.

59
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:18,625
We checked the reports and declared
we couldn't diagnose his problem.

60
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,541
We had discharged him.

61
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:25,500
But the patient's father insists
you should look at him once.

62
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:45,666
This is Dr. Suman
whom you wanted to consult with.

63
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:51,291
Hello, Doctor.

64
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,458
I've read your son's reports.

65
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,333
Everything is normal.

66
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,208
Please get him discharged.

67
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:06,791
You have to look at this video first.

68
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:11,833
This happened last night.

69
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,250
Would you call it normal?

70
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:26,416
I can understand your problem.

71
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:32,000
But every physician and neurologist
in this hospital have seen his reports.

72
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,875
They don't know what's causing this.

73
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,791
Please get him discharged.

74
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,833
Please take a look at him.

75
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,666
I am the CEO of this hospital.

76
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,875
My husband is the owner.

77
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,583
I am a psychiatrist too.

78
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,125
I don't treat such cases.

79
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:02,375
You're a doctor.
How can you say this?

80
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,208
My son is in immense pain.

81
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,541
Take a look.

82
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,791
He shivers in fear all day.

83
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,583
And at nights, he gets these fits.

84
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,083
Please treat him.

85
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:24,208
I don't know what kind of
a doctor you are or what you do.

86
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,833
Just treat him.

87
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,583
And only you can do it.

88
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:32,041
Just do it in any way you can.

89
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:33,958
You talk to your patients, don't you?

90
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,208
So talk to him.

91
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,583
Try to understand his problem.

92
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:41,833
I will leave whenever you ask me to.

93
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:50,458
Okay.

94
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:53,875
I'll take a look at him.

95
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:57,375
But then you'll get him discharged.

96
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,166
Yes.

97
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:37,708
Neeraj, I need to ask you a few questions.

98
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:38,916
May I?

99
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:40,625
-Yes.
-Yeah!

100
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,458
Which grade are you in?

101
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:47,791
Fifth.

102
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,125
Fifth?

103
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,000
I've been here before.

104
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,958
Here? In this hospital?

105
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,208
This room.

106
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:06,875
Your table was in that corner.

107
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:08,708
Below the AC.

108
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,291
That table was exactly there.

109
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:26,375
How do you know that?

110
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:28,625
I know.

111
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,500
I know everything about you.

112
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,625
Where you were born,
where you got your education,

113
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:36,333
when you got married.

114
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:37,958
I know everything.

115
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,666
So you read about me?

116
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,208
I don't need to.

117
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,750
I know everything.

118
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,958
I also know about Dr. Kamath.

119
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:56,875
What do you know about me?

120
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:58,458
Everything.

121
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:02,833
Ma'am, he starts rambling

122
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,375
whenever he gets those fits.

123
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,166
And it really scares me.

124
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:10,625
Where was I born?

125
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,458
Dehradun.

126
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:17,916
What's my brother's name?

127
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,666
Vikas Kamath.

128
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,333
And my sister?

129
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:28,916
You don't have a sister.

130
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:35,750
He's absolutely right.

131
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,083
What is the name of her husband?

132
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,208
Dr. Anil Asthana.

133
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:58,500
Can you tell us
where is Dr. Anil Asthana now?

134
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,916
Yes.

135
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,791
Where is Dr. Anil Asthana now?

136
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:05,625
He's dead.

137
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:07,166
Dead?

138
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:13,250
Where did he die?

139
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:14,583
You...

140
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,125
Near Lonavala.

141
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:23,958
Take this boy away.

142
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:27,291
Where have you been?
Wheel that boy out.

143
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,416
You shouldn't be scared of death.

144
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,791
Death is a beautiful thing.

145
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,083
You should try it once.

146
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,625
We should inform the police, ma'am.

147
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:13,583
Let the police decide
whether it's crap or true.

148
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:17,875
But if we keep it from the police,
we'll be held responsible.

149
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:51,458
Please come.

150
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:11,666
Sir, he is Neeraj.

151
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:32,791
The doctor tells me

152
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,958
you know where Dr. Asthana is.

153
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,208
Yes.

154
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:39,708
Where is he?

155
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,500
He is dead.

156
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:47,125
How?

157
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:48,833
He killed himself.

158
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:52,291
Where?

159
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,416
Near Lonavala.

160
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:56,791
Where in Lonavala?

161
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,000
Twelve kilometers away from Lonavala.

162
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:02,416
His car is in the bushes.

163
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:04,916
Also his dead body, it's in the car.

164
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,208
May I speak to you?

165
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:16,875
Yes.

166
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,458
Yes, sir.

167
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,000
I am going to Lonavala with my team.

168
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:37,791
You won't leave the hospital
unless I come back.

169
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:40,208
None of this is my son's fault, sir.

170
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:42,875
He's a patient.
He's here for treatment.

171
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:47,208
Mr. Jaimal, there is a car
and there's a dead body in the car.

172
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:50,000
There can be a criminal angle
to it as well.

173
00:17:50,083 --> 00:17:52,583
The investigation is my job, isn't it?

174
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:53,791
Yes.

175
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,916
You will stay in the hospital
until I return.

176
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,875
Yes, sir.

177
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,416
Post one of our men here.

178
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:03,500
Yes, sir.

179
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:04,750
Keep an eye on the boy.

180
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:05,791
Yes, sir.

181
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:38,291
All units, keep an eye out.

182
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,041
Atre, stop the car.

183
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,125
<span style="style.default_1">Yes, sir.</span>

184
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:30,500
Yes, sir.

185
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:33,166
That railing is broken, take a look.

186
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,458
Yes, sir.

187
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,291
Nothing is visible from up here, sir.

188
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,125
How far are we from Lonavala?

189
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:55,958
Around 10-15 kilometers.

190
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:02,916
-Tell everyone to get down.
-Sure.

191
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:04,250
Go down and take a look.

192
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:05,333
Yes, sir.

193
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,250
Come on.

194
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:12,750
Sir, it's right here.

195
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,333
Sir, we found the car.

196
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,125
Dr. Suman.

197
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:38,916
Yes.

198
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:41,166
That boy was right.

199
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:47,000
We found Dr. Anil's car
around 12 kilometers from Lonavala.

200
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:53,333
There's a dead body in the car,

201
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:56,916
but you'll have to confirm
whether it's Dr. Anil or not.

202
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:01,083
Come down to Matunga Hospital
in a little while.

203
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:02,958
I'll send the body there.

204
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:06,166
Yes.

205
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:56,375
I hope you don't mind.

206
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:57,958
No.

207
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:03,708
You see, Mr. Jaimal, I don't like
troubling you at this hour,

208
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:07,625
but I must find some answers before dawn.

209
00:23:13,416 --> 00:23:16,041
Neeraj was absolutely right.

210
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:19,750
We found Dr. Anil's dead body
in the car at the same spot.

211
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:22,416
How does your son know all this?

212
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:25,166
I don't know.

213
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:32,666
He started making these prophecies
since he's been getting fits.

214
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:36,833
I don't know how he knows these things.

215
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,583
Take a look at this video.

216
00:23:52,291 --> 00:23:53,583
Send me this video.

217
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:54,541
Yes, sir.

218
00:23:56,583 --> 00:24:00,666
Mr. Jaimal,
I know you're a decent man.

219
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:07,583
I also know you're stressed
because of your son's condition.

220
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:13,541
But this is a criminal investigation,
and it's linked to your son.

221
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:18,958
I can't stop
till I find some solid answers.

222
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,291
Tell me everything you know.

223
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,041
Yes, sir.

224
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,291
Until ten days ago,
my son Neeraj was absolutely normal.

225
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:32,000
I live in Ahmadabad.

226
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:33,875
We came to Mumbai for sightseeing.

227
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:35,916
Are you ready yet?

228
00:24:38,833 --> 00:24:42,166
<span style="style.default_1">Bheem! Little Bheem</span>

229
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:45,083
Neeraj.

230
00:24:46,833 --> 00:24:48,416
You're not ready yet.

231
00:24:48,541 --> 00:24:49,708
We're going out.

232
00:24:49,958 --> 00:24:52,875
I don't want to go.
I am going to watch TV.

233
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:55,750
How can we leave you alone here?

234
00:24:55,875 --> 00:24:57,208
You have to come along.

235
00:24:57,291 --> 00:24:58,500
I don't want to go.

236
00:24:58,583 --> 00:25:00,666
Let him stay here
if he doesn't want to go.

237
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,291
We'll be back soon.

238
00:25:36,958 --> 00:25:38,833
<span style="style.default_1">Dr. Anil Asthana is missing.</span>

239
00:25:38,958 --> 00:25:40,625
<span style="style.default_1">The missing report has been filed.</span>

240
00:25:40,708 --> 00:25:43,208
<span style="style.default_1">Mumbai Crime Branch</span>
<span style="style.default_1">will investigate the case now.</span>

241
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,208
<span style="style.default_1">...Dr. Anil Asthana is still missing.</span>

242
00:26:05,583 --> 00:26:07,166
<span style="style.default_1">Mumbai Crime Branch...</span>

243
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,625
Neeraj, my son.

244
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:52,000
-Neeraj!
-What's wrong with him?

245
00:26:52,083 --> 00:26:53,541
-What's the matter?
-What's happening?

246
00:26:53,625 --> 00:26:56,458
Dear, listen to me.
What's happening?

247
00:26:57,666 --> 00:27:00,291
Neeraj. What's happening?

248
00:27:00,625 --> 00:27:05,208
Take me... to Dr. Suman.

249
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:09,000
Quickly. Please take me to her.

250
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:11,000
-Son. Neeraj.
-Son.

251
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:25,208
Then we brought him here.

252
00:27:26,208 --> 00:27:28,208
Since then
he's been getting these fits.

253
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,250
And he keeps saying
these absurd things.

254
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,916
Mr. Jaimal, it's almost dawn.

255
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:50,583
Get some rest.
I'll talk to Neeraj in the morning.

256
00:29:26,583 --> 00:29:28,000
You should eat something.

257
00:29:29,458 --> 00:29:30,416
Not in the mood.

258
00:29:31,041 --> 00:29:32,791
I have a press conference.
I'll get something to eat there.

259
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,791
Listen, I have an appointment
with the doctor today.

260
00:29:42,083 --> 00:29:43,541
Won't you come along?

261
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:47,416
It would be nice
if you come along.

262
00:29:48,291 --> 00:29:50,833
I hate going there alone.

263
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:58,166
How many times will you go
to a doctor to try and conceive?

264
00:29:58,750 --> 00:29:59,958
You should stop now.

265
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,166
Fine.

266
00:30:14,375 --> 00:30:17,291
Don't be so gloomy.
Go to the doctor.

267
00:30:43,916 --> 00:30:45,041
Sir, we're ready.

268
00:31:02,166 --> 00:31:07,500
As you know, Dr. Anil Asthana
has been missing for the past 12 days.

269
00:31:08,375 --> 00:31:11,250
We found his body some time ago.

270
00:31:11,875 --> 00:31:14,500
In his car, near Lonavala.

271
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,833
His wife, Dr. Suman
has identified the body.

272
00:31:21,541 --> 00:31:25,125
We are still investigating, and only after
the investigation can we determine

273
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:29,000
whether this was an accident
or something else.

274
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:32,375
How did the police find out
after so many days where the car was?

275
00:31:33,583 --> 00:31:35,416
We got an anonymous call.

276
00:31:35,541 --> 00:31:36,458
From where?

277
00:31:37,708 --> 00:31:39,125
We are still investigating.

278
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:46,458
As soon as we have more details,
we'll inform you.

279
00:32:16,916 --> 00:32:18,041
I am fine.

280
00:32:18,541 --> 00:32:20,958
You were absolutely right.

281
00:32:21,416 --> 00:32:25,500
We found Dr. Anil's car in the bushes
near Lonavala like you said.

282
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:28,291
How could you know? Who told you this?

283
00:32:28,791 --> 00:32:30,875
No one told me.

284
00:32:31,541 --> 00:32:32,500
I see.

285
00:32:33,333 --> 00:32:35,500
Then how come you know about this?

286
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:37,916
I just know.

287
00:32:43,666 --> 00:32:46,625
Look, Neeraj, no need to be afraid.

288
00:32:48,125 --> 00:32:50,833
We just want to protect you.

289
00:32:51,083 --> 00:32:53,833
So it's crucial for us to know

290
00:32:53,916 --> 00:32:56,833
how you know all this.

291
00:32:57,958 --> 00:32:59,041
Who told you?

292
00:32:59,125 --> 00:33:01,083
No one tells me anything.

293
00:33:01,166 --> 00:33:02,833
I know everything.

294
00:33:15,416 --> 00:33:20,875
Look, Neeraj,
if you lie to me or hide anything,

295
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:26,375
I will take your dad and mom...

296
00:33:28,083 --> 00:33:29,458
to the police station.

297
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:33,708
And then you'll be
absolutely alone out here.

298
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:36,750
Right?

299
00:33:39,291 --> 00:33:40,250
Now tell me.

300
00:33:41,916 --> 00:33:44,375
Who told you about Dr. Anil?

301
00:33:44,833 --> 00:33:46,041
No one.

302
00:33:46,541 --> 00:33:48,458
I know everything.

303
00:33:49,166 --> 00:33:53,583
If you don't believe me,
you can test me.

304
00:33:55,041 --> 00:33:56,041
How is that?

305
00:33:56,625 --> 00:33:58,791
I can tell you something else.

306
00:33:59,958 --> 00:34:00,875
About what?

307
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:02,833
About Sunita.

308
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:04,541
Sunita, who?

309
00:34:04,833 --> 00:34:09,666
The chime of her anklets
sounded music to your ears.

310
00:34:22,666 --> 00:34:23,666
What?

311
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:30,375
You heard him, sir.

312
00:34:30,458 --> 00:34:32,375
He says such absurd things.

313
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:38,333
Please take him away, I...

314
00:34:40,375 --> 00:34:41,833
I will talk to him later.

315
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,250
Okay.

316
00:36:31,541 --> 00:36:32,958
Could I speak to Mr. Dinkar?

317
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:34,875
Speaking.

318
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:36,833
Hello, sir.

319
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:38,250
This is Shekhawat speaking.

320
00:36:38,625 --> 00:36:39,666
Shekhawat? Who?

321
00:36:40,541 --> 00:36:42,291
Shekhawat, the cop. sir.

322
00:36:42,708 --> 00:36:44,833
You helped me three years ago.

323
00:36:45,375 --> 00:36:48,708
Oh, Shekhawat.

324
00:36:48,791 --> 00:36:50,000
What is it, Shekhawat?

325
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:51,875
<span style="style.default_1">Did you lose your talisman?</span>

326
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,708
No. I still have the talisman, sir.

327
00:36:57,291 --> 00:37:00,541
Are those anklets troubling you again?

328
00:37:02,583 --> 00:37:04,333
No. That's not it.

329
00:37:05,875 --> 00:37:08,416
I am sending you a video, sir.

330
00:37:08,916 --> 00:37:10,250
Watch it first, then we'll talk.

331
00:37:10,583 --> 00:37:11,583
Okay.

332
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,375
Send it.

333
00:37:13,958 --> 00:37:14,833
Yes.

334
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:16,000
Sunita, get some ice.

335
00:38:42,083 --> 00:38:43,083
What is this?

336
00:38:44,791 --> 00:38:45,916
Urine report.

337
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:48,208
Whose?

338
00:38:48,791 --> 00:38:49,708
Mine.

339
00:38:50,291 --> 00:38:52,875
I am... pregnant.

340
00:38:55,916 --> 00:39:00,541
I did it on my own
and the test was positive.

341
00:39:00,875 --> 00:39:03,333
I thought I'd get a test done
at the lab too.

342
00:39:05,291 --> 00:39:06,375
Is this a joke?

343
00:39:08,333 --> 00:39:09,791
You know I am married.

344
00:39:11,291 --> 00:39:13,833
I have a job, a career,
it will all be ruined.

345
00:39:13,916 --> 00:39:14,833
Abort it.

346
00:39:16,416 --> 00:39:19,208
You should've considered it
before getting involved with me.

347
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:24,625
Whether you approve of it or not,
but I'm keeping this baby.

348
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,958
And also give him your name.

349
00:39:43,208 --> 00:39:46,791
I was joking.
Don't you get it?

350
00:39:50,875 --> 00:39:52,000
You can keep the baby.

351
00:39:53,666 --> 00:39:54,750
Give it my name.

352
00:39:55,166 --> 00:39:56,333
We will bring him up.

353
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,458
My wife is never going to have a child.

354
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:01,208
Are you okay?

355
00:40:57,958 --> 00:41:04,375
<span style="style.default_1">These fallacious eyes</span>

356
00:41:11,333 --> 00:41:17,333
<span style="style.default_1">My beloved almost killed me</span>

357
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:26,833
<span style="style.default_1">Let's go to the court</span>

358
00:41:26,916 --> 00:41:30,166
<span style="style.default_1">Oh brave warrior</span>

359
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:43,041
<span style="style.default_1">My beloved almost killed me</span>

360
00:42:15,583 --> 00:42:21,416
<span style="style.default_1">He cast a spell on me</span>

361
00:42:28,291 --> 00:42:34,208
<span style="style.default_1">He drove me crazy and then robbed me</span>

362
00:42:43,958 --> 00:42:50,291
<span style="style.default_1">This river is all dried now</span>

363
00:42:57,416 --> 00:43:03,291
<span style="style.default_1">My beloved almost killed me</span>

364
00:43:10,291 --> 00:43:16,250
<span style="style.default_1">Let's go to the court, oh brave warrior</span>

365
00:43:23,166 --> 00:43:29,083
<span style="style.default_1">My beloved almost killed me</span>

366
00:46:44,458 --> 00:46:46,250
-Shekhawat.
-Yes.

367
00:46:46,333 --> 00:46:50,541
Immerse this anklet in the Ganga.

368
00:46:51,125 --> 00:46:52,041
Okay.

369
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,333
And always keep this talisman on.

370
00:46:57,833 --> 00:47:00,416
I've cast a spell on it with my magic.

371
00:47:00,833 --> 00:47:04,916
As long as you keep it on,
she will never come close to you.

372
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,958
So wear it all the time.

373
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:10,375
Guard it with your life,
there won't be a new talisman.

374
00:47:34,291 --> 00:47:36,708
Sir, did you see the video?

375
00:47:37,208 --> 00:47:38,166
I did.

376
00:47:38,458 --> 00:47:40,125
I want information on that boy.

377
00:47:40,375 --> 00:47:42,125
Come down to Banaras, Shekhawat.

378
00:47:43,708 --> 00:47:46,083
These things can't be discussed
over the phone.

379
00:47:46,333 --> 00:47:47,833
I can't come to Banaras, Sir.

380
00:47:48,708 --> 00:47:50,916
I want information about that boy
right away.

381
00:47:51,833 --> 00:47:56,625
The boy has been possessed.

382
00:47:56,916 --> 00:47:58,541
<span style="style.default_1">Don't look into his eyes.</span>

383
00:47:59,208 --> 00:48:03,291
Else he'll know everything about you.

384
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,625
He already knows everything about me.

385
00:48:07,166 --> 00:48:09,375
But how can he know?

386
00:48:10,083 --> 00:48:13,958
Ghosts, spirits, ghouls, witches,

387
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:19,583
they all seem similar,
but they are different.

388
00:48:20,208 --> 00:48:22,291
<span style="style.default_1">Ghosts can enter bodies</span>

389
00:48:22,958 --> 00:48:25,166
and find out everything.

390
00:48:25,916 --> 00:48:27,125
What is this ghost?

391
00:48:27,541 --> 00:48:28,833
And why did it enter his body?

392
00:48:29,208 --> 00:48:34,416
If a person is killed
before his due time,

393
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:38,708
he can come back
into this world for revenge.

394
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:43,416
That's all I can tell you over the phone.

395
00:48:44,541 --> 00:48:45,458
Yes.

396
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:37,125
Yes, sir.

397
00:49:37,333 --> 00:49:39,000
Go to Hotel Meghdoot right now.

398
00:49:39,291 --> 00:49:40,500
Yes, sir. I'll go right away.

399
00:49:41,208 --> 00:49:43,458
And find out
whether Neeraj and his family

400
00:49:43,541 --> 00:49:45,666
were staying in room number 706 or not.

401
00:49:45,833 --> 00:49:47,208
Yes, sir. I'll find out right now.

402
00:49:47,291 --> 00:49:48,750
I am waiting for your call.

403
00:49:49,083 --> 00:49:50,500
Yes, sir, I'll call you back.

404
00:50:25,166 --> 00:50:26,458
PSI Atre, Crime Branch.

405
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:30,750
Which room were Jaimal Aggarwal
and his family staying in?

406
00:50:36,291 --> 00:50:38,708
Jaimal Aggarwal, 27th August.

407
00:50:39,333 --> 00:50:40,708
Room number 706.

408
00:50:46,416 --> 00:50:48,208
-Yes, Atre.
-You were right, sir.

409
00:50:48,291 --> 00:50:51,791
Jaimal Aggarwal and Neeraj were
staying in room 706 of Hotel Meghdoot.

410
00:50:54,291 --> 00:50:55,750
-Atre.
-Yes, sir.

411
00:50:56,666 --> 00:50:59,666
Get me all the CCTV footage
of that hotel for 12th May.

412
00:51:06,083 --> 00:51:09,500
I want CCTV footage of your hotel
for 12th May.

413
00:51:10,083 --> 00:51:12,541
It will take some time.
Take a seat. I'll arrange it.

414
00:51:12,958 --> 00:51:13,958
Hurry.

415
00:51:39,625 --> 00:51:41,791
This is the CCTV footage
from Hotel Meghdoot.

416
00:52:37,791 --> 00:52:39,041
Shall I make tea for you?

417
00:52:39,458 --> 00:52:40,375
No.

418
00:52:41,833 --> 00:52:44,166
There are some printouts,
get them for me.

419
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:45,208
Yes.

420
00:53:12,416 --> 00:53:13,375
<span style="style.default_1">Yes.</span>

421
00:53:13,958 --> 00:53:15,000
This is Shekhawat.

422
00:53:16,583 --> 00:53:19,625
Could you meet me at my office in a while?

423
00:53:20,333 --> 00:53:21,291
At this hour?

424
00:53:21,583 --> 00:53:22,458
<span style="style.default_1">Yes.</span>

425
00:53:22,583 --> 00:53:24,541
Call me in the morning,
we'll meet.

426
00:53:25,333 --> 00:53:26,333
I am sleeping now.

427
00:53:26,458 --> 00:53:28,166
I've lost my sleep, Mrs. Suman.

428
00:53:29,458 --> 00:53:33,958
And I think you're not
sleeping peacefully either.

429
00:53:34,666 --> 00:53:35,666
What's the matter?

430
00:53:37,583 --> 00:53:40,041
Hotel Meghdoot, Bandra.

431
00:53:52,958 --> 00:53:56,583
I'll meet you in my office at 1 a.m.

432
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:58,541
I am coming.

433
00:55:09,208 --> 00:55:11,125
-Yes.
-DCP Shekhawat's office?

434
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,291
Up there, first floor.

435
00:55:27,833 --> 00:55:29,875
Sir, Dr. Suman's here.

436
00:55:31,125 --> 00:55:32,125
Send her in.

437
00:55:35,291 --> 00:55:36,291
Come in.

438
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,583
I'm sorry for calling you at this hour.

439
00:55:42,416 --> 00:55:46,125
But this is important,
so I had to speak to you.

440
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:50,416
Ever been to Hotel Meghdoot in Bandra?

441
00:55:54,666 --> 00:55:55,500
No.

442
00:55:56,541 --> 00:55:57,375
Yeah.

443
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:03,708
Did you have anything to do
with Hotel Meghdoot?

444
00:56:07,333 --> 00:56:08,250
No.

445
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:12,208
Then why did you rush here
in the middle of the night

446
00:56:12,291 --> 00:56:15,250
after you heard about Hotel Meghdoot?

447
00:56:17,375 --> 00:56:19,000
I didn't come here to answer riddles.

448
00:56:23,291 --> 00:56:27,375
Mrs. Suman, Google is a weird thing.

449
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:33,041
A person can forget his own actions,
but not Google.

450
00:56:34,083 --> 00:56:39,125
You'll be amazed, but when I searched
for Hotel Meghdoot on Google,

451
00:56:39,916 --> 00:56:41,583
this news item comes up on the first page.

452
00:56:48,583 --> 00:56:50,875
Rahul Bora, age; 24.

453
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:56,166
Six months ago, he jumped to death
from the terrace of Hotel Meghdoot.

454
00:56:57,458 --> 00:57:00,500
His father said his mental condition
wasn't right

455
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:03,875
and Dr. Suman was treating him.

456
00:57:05,416 --> 00:57:07,000
Rahul Bora, I know him.

457
00:57:07,375 --> 00:57:09,000
It was a case of a suicidal syndrome.

458
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,541
He tried to swallow poison.

459
00:57:12,333 --> 00:57:16,208
<span style="style.default_1">In fact, I took multiple sessions</span>
<span style="style.default_1">with him during his treatment.</span>

460
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,208
Look, other doctors are treating you.

461
00:57:25,958 --> 00:57:27,791
I am just your psychiatrist,

462
00:57:28,833 --> 00:57:31,291
so we're going to have a long chat.
Okay?

463
00:57:33,708 --> 00:57:36,083
You tried to kill yourself three times.

464
00:57:39,208 --> 00:57:41,041
Why are you in such a hurry to die?

465
00:57:42,458 --> 00:57:44,083
You should live your life to the fullest.

466
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,166
Everyone has to die some day.

467
00:57:50,958 --> 00:57:54,416
Talking and making others talk
is the way I treat.

468
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:57,708
I prescribe fewer pills and talk more.

469
00:57:59,083 --> 00:58:01,000
Would you please tell me
why you did it?

470
00:58:08,083 --> 00:58:08,958
I like it.

471
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:12,625
What do you like?

472
00:58:14,125 --> 00:58:16,208
I like dying rather than living.

473
00:58:19,083 --> 00:58:20,041
Reason?

474
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:25,666
I treated him for a couple of months.

475
00:58:26,958 --> 00:58:28,083
Then he left.

476
00:58:29,708 --> 00:58:30,958
I've read about it too.

477
00:58:37,041 --> 00:58:39,333
You are responsible
for Rahul Bora's death.

478
00:58:40,666 --> 00:58:42,083
How can you say that?

479
00:58:42,958 --> 00:58:45,375
Not me, but Rahul Bora believes it.

480
00:58:46,125 --> 00:58:48,500
How do you know
what Rahul Bora believes?

481
00:58:48,875 --> 00:58:50,208
He's no more.

482
00:58:52,208 --> 00:58:53,333
Rahul Bora has come back.

483
00:58:59,958 --> 00:59:03,375
Your former patient Rahul Bora's
spirit has possessed Neeraj.

484
00:59:09,541 --> 00:59:10,833
What are you saying?

485
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,708
Before rejecting my statement,

486
00:59:14,416 --> 00:59:19,125
you must first understand
I am not an illiterate hillbilly.

487
00:59:19,625 --> 00:59:22,500
I am an IPS officer
and a qualified engineer.

488
00:59:23,625 --> 00:59:27,208
Tell me, what is wrong with Neeraj?

489
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,583
Why does he go into violent convulsions?

490
00:59:30,041 --> 00:59:32,750
How does Neeraj know
what others don't?

491
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:42,791
Rahul Bora died
in Hotel Meghdoot's room 706.

492
00:59:43,958 --> 00:59:46,750
Neeraj fell sick in that room.

493
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:49,958
Maybe you don't know,

494
00:59:50,333 --> 00:59:52,625
but Neeraj's father brought him
to your hospital

495
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:57,125
instead of taking him anywhere else.

496
01:00:00,333 --> 01:00:02,125
Even I didn't believe in these things.

497
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:04,333
But...

498
01:00:06,958 --> 01:00:08,708
I've seen a spirit with my own eyes.

499
01:00:13,083 --> 01:00:13,958
I am leaving.

500
01:00:14,666 --> 01:00:15,583
Su...

501
01:02:58,833 --> 01:03:00,666
Are you here to see me?

502
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:05,916
Yes... I came to see you.

503
01:03:06,375 --> 01:03:08,416
You didn't sleep.
You're still awake.

504
01:03:08,958 --> 01:03:10,500
What did you want from me?

505
01:03:11,375 --> 01:03:12,666
I just came to see you.

506
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,083
No one goes anywhere without reason.

507
01:03:26,125 --> 01:03:28,208
I want to tell you something.

508
01:03:29,375 --> 01:03:31,041
What? What do you want to say?

509
01:03:31,416 --> 01:03:32,791
Come closer.

510
01:03:34,125 --> 01:03:36,083
I want to say something in your ear.

511
01:03:51,208 --> 01:03:53,541
I had fun dying.

512
01:03:53,625 --> 01:03:55,625
You should try it too.

513
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:57,791
You will like it.

514
01:05:19,791 --> 01:05:21,125
I want to meet you.

515
01:05:22,625 --> 01:05:23,625
Now?

516
01:05:28,625 --> 01:05:30,541
Meet me in front
of the Mahalakshmi Temple.

517
01:05:31,541 --> 01:05:32,416
Yes.

518
01:06:45,916 --> 01:06:46,916
Do you have a cigarette?

519
01:07:15,041 --> 01:07:16,583
The story is still incomplete.

520
01:07:22,291 --> 01:07:23,125
Deepika.

521
01:07:23,291 --> 01:07:24,708
Deepika was his girlfriend.

522
01:07:27,375 --> 01:07:29,666
She married an NRI and moved to the US.

523
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:34,750
Rahul, love is just a chemical reaction.

524
01:07:35,583 --> 01:07:37,208
It can be treated.

525
01:07:38,291 --> 01:07:42,958
You're trying desperately to kill yourself
because you had a heartbreak.

526
01:07:43,375 --> 01:07:44,833
This is a mental illness.

527
01:07:51,458 --> 01:07:55,791
"The sands of the desert can't imagine
what raindrops feel like."

528
01:07:56,125 --> 01:07:59,083
You sound like
you've been devoid of this feeling.

529
01:07:59,208 --> 01:08:02,458
You know nothing about my condition.
How will you treat me?

530
01:08:07,125 --> 01:08:08,708
<span style="style.default_1">He was standing...</span>

531
01:08:10,083 --> 01:08:11,625
but on shaky ground.

532
01:08:14,625 --> 01:08:16,000
For the first time, I realized

533
01:08:17,125 --> 01:08:21,583
I sacrificed a lot
to make some gains.

534
01:08:24,708 --> 01:08:28,541
The age difference between
Dr. Anil and I never bothered me.

535
01:08:33,208 --> 01:08:34,291
This is Rahul's file.

536
01:08:34,541 --> 01:08:35,750
Give it to some other doctor.

537
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,541
I can't treat him.

538
01:08:37,958 --> 01:08:40,500
And, what about the medicines
you prescribed him?

539
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:42,708
Stop them.

540
01:08:52,750 --> 01:08:55,375
<span style="style.default_1">Ma'am, Rahul tried</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to commit suicide again.</span>

541
01:09:14,333 --> 01:09:16,958
I don't understand
what I should do with you.

542
01:09:21,833 --> 01:09:23,875
<span style="style.default_1">I started treating him again.</span>

543
01:09:35,291 --> 01:09:36,625
I want a cigarette.

544
01:09:38,375 --> 01:09:39,666
This is a hospital, Rahul.

545
01:09:58,583 --> 01:10:00,583
Rahul was getting better.

546
01:10:03,958 --> 01:10:05,541
And my condition was getting worse.

547
01:10:08,875 --> 01:10:10,458
I was bitten by love.

548
01:10:23,291 --> 01:10:26,000
<span style="style.default_1">Dr. Anil hated me for smoking.</span>

549
01:10:26,833 --> 01:10:29,458
After our marriage
he made me promise...

550
01:10:31,041 --> 01:10:32,458
that I'd never smoke again.

551
01:10:56,625 --> 01:10:58,000
We didn't know about the destination

552
01:10:58,958 --> 01:11:00,583
but the journey had begun.

553
01:11:14,083 --> 01:11:17,041
<span style="style.default_1">I knew this wouldn't go on</span>
<span style="style.default_1">for too long.</span>

554
01:11:20,750 --> 01:11:23,666
He was the crazy one, not me.

555
01:11:24,958 --> 01:11:28,125
<span style="style.default_1">I was beginning to realize</span>
<span style="style.default_1">my mistake and naivety.</span>

556
01:11:29,083 --> 01:11:31,125
<span style="style.default_1">The time had come to end this journey.</span>

557
01:11:32,458 --> 01:11:35,958
I stopped talking to Rahul,
I stopped meeting him.

558
01:11:45,333 --> 01:11:47,541
He kept chasing me like a madman.

559
01:11:48,583 --> 01:11:51,458
He would wait at the hospital
for hours to meet me.

560
01:11:54,250 --> 01:11:56,375
But I had made my decision.

561
01:11:56,958 --> 01:12:00,166
<span style="style.default_1">He kept calling me</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and I kept disconnecting.</span>

562
01:12:13,291 --> 01:12:14,333
Suman.

563
01:12:15,541 --> 01:12:17,666
Any progress with your Jaipur case?

564
01:12:20,416 --> 01:12:22,250
There is no special improvement.

565
01:12:30,291 --> 01:12:33,916
Madam. Rahul is here to see you.

566
01:12:38,375 --> 01:12:39,375
Who is Rahul?

567
01:12:40,083 --> 01:12:41,083
He is a patient.

568
01:12:42,250 --> 01:12:43,708
Then why is he visiting you at home?

569
01:12:44,750 --> 01:12:46,041
Send him back.

570
01:12:47,041 --> 01:12:49,083
Tell him that madam
doesn't see anyone at home.

571
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:50,375
Go.

572
01:12:50,583 --> 01:12:53,250
I told him, but he refuses to leave.

573
01:12:53,958 --> 01:12:57,333
He's saying he won't leave
without meeting madam.

574
01:13:00,958 --> 01:13:02,916
No, I'll go take a look.

575
01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:20,416
What nonsense is this?

576
01:13:20,875 --> 01:13:22,041
Why did you come here?

577
01:13:22,833 --> 01:13:24,041
Why aren't you answering my calls?

578
01:13:24,166 --> 01:13:26,541
Don't you understand why?

579
01:13:27,166 --> 01:13:28,958
I don't want this relationship, Rahul.

580
01:13:39,958 --> 01:13:41,125
And then he left.

581
01:13:43,291 --> 01:13:47,125
And that night he jumped
from Hotel Meghdoot to his death.

582
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:55,958
Now the story is complete.

583
01:14:00,458 --> 01:14:03,250
Now I understand everything.

584
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:09,250
Let's go.

585
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:12,375
I have to catch a flight to Banaras.

586
01:14:56,250 --> 01:14:57,125
Stop here.

587
01:16:20,833 --> 01:16:22,000
Shekhawat.

588
01:16:27,375 --> 01:16:28,291
Come in.

589
01:16:38,416 --> 01:16:40,958
Is everything all right?

590
01:16:44,583 --> 01:16:47,625
Sunita is troubling me again.

591
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:51,000
She came back last night.

592
01:17:07,083 --> 01:17:10,708
She... came to kill you.

593
01:17:12,791 --> 01:17:16,916
But she couldn't get to you
because of that talisman.

594
01:17:17,833 --> 01:17:21,083
That ghost is the reason
behind this incident.

595
01:17:21,333 --> 01:17:23,708
<span style="style.default_1">He's possessed that boy.</span>

596
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:30,041
He, along with Sunita
wants to get rid of you.

597
01:17:31,208 --> 01:17:35,875
Because you are an obstruction
in his path.

598
01:17:36,916 --> 01:17:39,083
What does Rahul Bora's spirit want?

599
01:17:40,041 --> 01:17:41,250
Why is he back?

600
01:17:53,708 --> 01:17:57,083
He wants to kill Dr. Suman.

601
01:17:58,333 --> 01:18:02,791
And he will take her to his world.

602
01:18:03,916 --> 01:18:08,625
And expose all your secrets.

603
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:14,125
And then... finish you off.

604
01:18:18,625 --> 01:18:20,416
Show me a way to get out of this.

605
01:18:23,458 --> 01:18:24,750
There are two solutions.

606
01:18:26,833 --> 01:18:32,583
First, the ghost stops
possessing that boy.

607
01:18:33,791 --> 01:18:35,125
But that is impossible.

608
01:18:35,875 --> 01:18:37,125
He will never leave the boy.

609
01:18:38,541 --> 01:18:39,625
And the second?

610
01:19:02,625 --> 01:19:04,583
Finish him off.

611
01:19:47,166 --> 01:19:50,333
I want a complete roundup of that area.
Ask each and every person.

612
01:20:19,541 --> 01:20:20,416
Yes, sir.

613
01:20:20,666 --> 01:20:21,750
-Atre.
<span style="style.default_1">-Yes.</span>

614
01:20:22,166 --> 01:20:25,083
Wasn't Shinde the PSI in Bandra Two?

615
01:20:25,375 --> 01:20:26,291
Yes, sir.

616
01:20:26,916 --> 01:20:28,000
Where is he now?

617
01:20:29,541 --> 01:20:30,708
He's in Pune now.

618
01:20:31,791 --> 01:20:32,708
Okay.

619
01:20:33,833 --> 01:20:36,416
Find out his number,
call him and ask him to speak to me.

620
01:20:36,750 --> 01:20:37,708
Yes, sir.

621
01:20:37,958 --> 01:20:38,791
Now.

622
01:20:38,875 --> 01:20:40,375
Yes, sir. I'll do it right away.

623
01:20:52,708 --> 01:20:54,125
But he hasn't arrived yet.

624
01:20:55,125 --> 01:20:56,083
Just a second.

625
01:20:59,291 --> 01:21:00,208
Inspector Shinde.

626
01:21:00,750 --> 01:21:01,708
Yes.

627
01:21:01,791 --> 01:21:04,416
PSI Atre from Mumbai Crime Branch.

628
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,125
Yes, Inspector Atre.

629
01:21:06,208 --> 01:21:07,875
DCP Shekhawat wants to speak with you.

630
01:21:14,458 --> 01:21:15,791
Shinde on the line, sir.

631
01:21:19,083 --> 01:21:22,833
Atre, find out whom
this car is registered to.

632
01:21:22,958 --> 01:21:23,833
Yes.

633
01:21:26,291 --> 01:21:28,208
-Hello, Shinde.
-Yes, sir.

634
01:21:29,125 --> 01:21:33,291
Six months ago, Hotel Meghdoot Bandra,
a boy committed suicide.

635
01:21:33,666 --> 01:21:34,833
<span style="style.default_1">His name was Rahul Bora.</span>

636
01:21:35,666 --> 01:21:37,666
Did you investigate that case?

637
01:21:37,958 --> 01:21:40,166
Yes, sir. I investigated that case.

638
01:21:40,750 --> 01:21:41,958
Do you remember any details?

639
01:21:42,208 --> 01:21:44,041
It was a simple case of a suicide, sir.

640
01:21:44,375 --> 01:21:47,208
That boy was mentally unstable.
So he committed suicide.

641
01:21:49,708 --> 01:21:51,291
Any other details?

642
01:21:51,625 --> 01:21:53,666
No, sir. It was a suicide case.

643
01:21:57,458 --> 01:21:58,458
Okay, thank you.

644
01:22:40,125 --> 01:22:41,083
Uncle.

645
01:22:41,666 --> 01:22:44,000
I know about another dead body.

646
01:22:44,416 --> 01:22:47,291
It's a woman in Banaras.

647
01:22:48,208 --> 01:22:52,083
She has an anklet on one leg,
and the other one is missing.

648
01:22:54,250 --> 01:22:57,083
Tell Inspector Shekhawat to speak with me.

649
01:23:02,750 --> 01:23:05,708
Sir, that boy Neeraj is
talking about another dead body.

650
01:23:06,208 --> 01:23:08,000
In Banaras. Some woman.

651
01:23:38,208 --> 01:23:42,250
If you don't have an objection,
I want to talk to Neeraj.

652
01:23:46,250 --> 01:23:50,166
No, you'll speak to him in my presence.

653
01:23:53,125 --> 01:23:55,583
Leave, Papa. I will talk to him.

654
01:23:57,791 --> 01:24:00,916
You can't speak to a boy like this.

655
01:24:02,125 --> 01:24:04,541
Please go, Papa, I want to talk to him.

656
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,666
I know you're Rahul Bora.

657
01:24:26,791 --> 01:24:29,333
And I also know why you are here.

658
01:24:30,541 --> 01:24:33,708
But if you try to make things difficult
for me,

659
01:24:34,416 --> 01:24:36,750
then I can go to any limits.

660
01:24:38,375 --> 01:24:39,375
You...

661
01:24:41,375 --> 01:24:42,333
Look.

662
01:24:46,291 --> 01:24:51,458
If you tell anyone about Sunita,
I'll send Dr. Suman to jail.

663
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:52,875
And here's the evidence.

664
01:24:55,208 --> 01:24:58,458
Then you will never succeed
in your motive.

665
01:24:59,458 --> 01:25:01,500
You will never have Dr. Suman.

666
01:25:01,833 --> 01:25:03,541
You'll keep wandering for centuries.

667
01:25:06,333 --> 01:25:07,458
Remember that.

668
01:25:39,166 --> 01:25:40,166
<span style="style.default_1">Shekhawat.</span>

669
01:25:40,375 --> 01:25:41,250
Yes.

670
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:43,291
Time to put an end to this story.

671
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,666
I've found a solution to this problem.

672
01:25:46,583 --> 01:25:48,166
Meet me in my office tonight.

673
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,541
I want to show you something.

674
01:25:52,375 --> 01:25:54,333
Look, I am tired of this routine.

675
01:25:54,708 --> 01:25:56,291
Even I am tired of it.

676
01:25:57,083 --> 01:25:58,291
Meet me tonight at midnight.

677
01:25:58,625 --> 01:25:59,583
<span style="style.default_1">Yes.</span>

678
01:27:13,708 --> 01:27:15,833
Finish that boy.

679
01:27:28,541 --> 01:27:29,875
Come, Mrs. Suman.

680
01:27:38,291 --> 01:27:39,416
Would you...

681
01:27:41,083 --> 01:27:42,208
like a drink?

682
01:27:46,791 --> 01:27:47,958
Have it, Mrs. Suman.

683
01:27:53,166 --> 01:27:54,458
You will need it.

684
01:28:02,625 --> 01:28:04,250
On the night of 12th May,

685
01:28:04,833 --> 01:28:09,583
Rahul Bora jumped from
the terrace of Hotel Meghdoot.

686
01:28:10,833 --> 01:28:15,250
These photos are from
Hotel Meghdoot's CCTV cameras.

687
01:28:17,583 --> 01:28:18,708
And this...

688
01:28:19,916 --> 01:28:20,791
is you.

689
01:28:25,291 --> 01:28:26,875
How do you know that's me?

690
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:32,541
Irrespective of what you think of me,

691
01:28:32,625 --> 01:28:35,125
I am always thorough
with my investigations.

692
01:28:35,791 --> 01:28:40,500
Something's missing from Rahul Bora's
120-page suicide case record.

693
01:28:41,250 --> 01:28:42,625
And I've found out what that is.

694
01:28:45,708 --> 01:28:52,333
Suman, your car's license plate number
is MH-03-ZI-2356.

695
01:28:54,625 --> 01:28:59,583
Your car was parked
at Hotel Meghdoot at 10 p.m.

696
01:29:01,041 --> 01:29:03,583
That night you went to meet Rahul Bora.

697
01:29:08,708 --> 01:29:13,791
Spirits don't come after anyone
without reason.

698
01:29:16,583 --> 01:29:19,375
Sunita was pregnant,
and I strangled her to death.

699
01:29:19,833 --> 01:29:21,916
And buried her dead body
on the shores of the Ganga.

700
01:29:23,333 --> 01:29:27,833
She kept chasing me,
but this talisman has kept me safe.

701
01:29:29,791 --> 01:29:34,291
You are behind Rahul Bora's death, Suman.

702
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:40,541
Your story is still incomplete.

703
01:29:43,875 --> 01:29:45,500
What is the entire story, Mrs. Suman?

704
01:30:05,791 --> 01:30:06,958
What nonsense is this?

705
01:30:07,375 --> 01:30:08,666
Why did you come here?

706
01:30:09,375 --> 01:30:10,541
Why aren't you answering my calls?

707
01:30:10,625 --> 01:30:12,916
Don't you understand why?

708
01:30:13,625 --> 01:30:15,500
I don't want this relationship, Rahul.

709
01:30:17,958 --> 01:30:19,083
How can it be over?

710
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,750
Don't act like a child, Rahul.

711
01:30:22,208 --> 01:30:24,125
What happened shouldn't have happened.

712
01:30:24,416 --> 01:30:26,208
You have your entire life ahead of you.

713
01:30:26,458 --> 01:30:27,708
Please leave me.

714
01:30:28,041 --> 01:30:29,625
I can't leave you.

715
01:30:30,125 --> 01:30:31,958
It's not in my power to leave you.

716
01:30:32,291 --> 01:30:34,333
I will never let this relationship end.

717
01:30:34,875 --> 01:30:36,291
I am a psychiatrist.

718
01:30:37,875 --> 01:30:39,791
When I saw Rahul...

719
01:30:41,375 --> 01:30:43,500
I realized this madness cannot be cured.

720
01:30:44,250 --> 01:30:48,750
<span style="style.default_1">I knew in a second</span>
<span style="style.default_1">why Majnu was stoned to death.</span>

721
01:30:49,250 --> 01:30:51,583
<span style="style.default_1">Why Mansoor was hanged to death.</span>

722
01:30:51,958 --> 01:30:54,208
<span style="style.default_1">And why Meera was poisoned?</span>

723
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,833
Because there's no cure for love.

724
01:30:58,541 --> 01:31:01,291
The only way to get rid of it
is to get rid of the person.

725
01:31:06,625 --> 01:31:08,083
I'll call you in the evening.

726
01:31:08,625 --> 01:31:09,708
Now leave.

727
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:18,666
<span style="style.default_1">There's not much difference</span>
<span style="style.default_1">between poison and medicine.</span>

728
01:31:20,041 --> 01:31:23,333
Sugar acts like medicine
for a patient with low blood pressure.

729
01:31:23,875 --> 01:31:26,500
<span style="style.default_1">And that same sugar can be poison</span>
<span style="style.default_1">for a diabetic.</span>

730
01:31:36,166 --> 01:31:40,375
<span style="style.default_1">Rahul was on drugs</span>
<span style="style.default_1">that controlled his emotions.</span>

731
01:31:41,083 --> 01:31:47,166
But for a depressive patient, we use
drugs that can aggravate their emotions.

732
01:31:58,083 --> 01:32:00,541
Book a room in Hotel Meghdoot's terrace.

733
01:32:01,708 --> 01:32:03,416
I'll see you there tonight.

734
01:32:03,958 --> 01:32:05,375
Okay, promise.

735
01:32:05,750 --> 01:32:06,750
Don't call.

736
01:32:07,791 --> 01:32:09,208
I'll find out the room number.

737
01:32:09,583 --> 01:32:11,625
Okay. But we're meeting tonight,
aren't we?

738
01:32:22,750 --> 01:32:25,458
Stop here on the left, thank you.

739
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:35,791
I knew you would come.

740
01:33:39,458 --> 01:33:40,750
Did you take your medicines?

741
01:33:41,458 --> 01:33:44,041
You are here now,
I don't need medicines.

742
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:51,208
Come with me,
I'll bring your medicines, okay?

743
01:35:15,375 --> 01:35:19,625
I gave Rahul some drugs
so he couldn't control his emotions.

744
01:35:25,916 --> 01:35:27,583
I feel strange.

745
01:35:46,541 --> 01:35:48,291
You will feel strange, Rahul.

746
01:35:50,583 --> 01:35:52,125
The medicine is taking effect.

747
01:35:54,541 --> 01:35:56,666
Rahul's body had turned into a bomb.

748
01:36:00,208 --> 01:36:01,916
I just had to light the fuse.

749
01:36:02,666 --> 01:36:04,125
I never loved you.

750
01:36:05,416 --> 01:36:07,500
You're just a necessity.

751
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:09,958
But you're no fun now.

752
01:36:15,791 --> 01:36:17,708
You're joking, right?

753
01:36:18,750 --> 01:36:21,083
You're making a joke
out of yourself, Rahul.

754
01:36:34,291 --> 01:36:36,208
<span style="style.default_1">A patient with suicidal syndrome</span>

755
01:36:36,875 --> 01:36:39,208
with a lethal dose of 500 milligrams.

756
01:36:40,250 --> 01:36:41,791
And a broken heart.

757
01:36:44,125 --> 01:36:45,416
The shot was fired.

758
01:37:14,916 --> 01:37:16,958
<span style="style.default_1">Rahul was on drugs for a decade.</span>

759
01:37:17,291 --> 01:37:21,041
So I knew the drug overdose would
never be detected in the blood test.

760
01:37:24,208 --> 01:37:27,375
<span style="style.default_1">Hundred milligrams was</span>
<span style="style.default_1">enough to provoke Rahul.</span>

761
01:37:28,041 --> 01:37:30,041
But I gave him 500 milligrams.

762
01:37:30,416 --> 01:37:34,250
I thought a lover like
him deserves a grand exit.

763
01:38:47,708 --> 01:38:50,166
Love had found its destination.

764
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:02,958
Now tell me what you want from me?

765
01:39:25,416 --> 01:39:30,166
Sometimes the taint on your reputation
can't be washed with just water.

766
01:39:31,708 --> 01:39:33,916
You need to wash it with blood.

767
01:39:40,208 --> 01:39:42,083
You must kill Rahul again.

768
01:39:44,333 --> 01:39:45,333
What do you mean?

769
01:39:46,541 --> 01:39:50,958
If Neeraj is no more,
Rahul will stop possessing him.

770
01:39:51,041 --> 01:39:52,125
End of trouble.

771
01:39:53,541 --> 01:39:56,500
We must kill Neeraj.

772
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:02,583
And you're saying... I should do it.

773
01:40:06,583 --> 01:40:08,291
I can't kill that child.

774
01:40:10,750 --> 01:40:12,208
I can't do it.

775
01:40:12,958 --> 01:40:14,958
You can do anything you want.

776
01:40:16,333 --> 01:40:17,875
You're a doctor, Suman.

777
01:40:18,708 --> 01:40:20,291
You own the entire hospital.

778
01:40:22,458 --> 01:40:24,125
And you have experience as well.

779
01:40:28,125 --> 01:40:30,375
You will definitely
come up with something.

780
01:40:32,708 --> 01:40:33,916
I can't do this.

781
01:40:34,166 --> 01:40:35,916
Rahul will never spare me.

782
01:40:38,791 --> 01:40:43,500
And if I go down,
I will take you with me.

783
01:40:45,041 --> 01:40:46,666
I have all the evidence I need.

784
01:40:49,875 --> 01:40:51,500
This is impossible.

785
01:40:52,333 --> 01:40:56,583
I told you, you will need a drink.

786
01:40:57,958 --> 01:41:01,291
Take it, and think again.

787
01:41:02,291 --> 01:41:04,750
Even the impossible will seem possible.

788
01:41:25,958 --> 01:41:28,708
Tomorrow, before daybreak...

789
01:41:30,666 --> 01:41:32,041
I should have your answer.

790
01:42:28,458 --> 01:42:29,291
Yes.

791
01:42:29,833 --> 01:42:31,083
You were right.

792
01:42:32,083 --> 01:42:33,708
We must kill Neeraj.

793
01:42:45,791 --> 01:42:47,791
I wanted to discuss
something important with you.

794
01:42:47,916 --> 01:42:48,875
Please tell me.

795
01:42:49,583 --> 01:42:53,625
I want to treat Neeraj differently.

796
01:42:54,041 --> 01:42:55,583
I don't understand.

797
01:42:55,666 --> 01:43:00,458
I want to take Neeraj back
to the hotel room where he fell ill.

798
01:43:00,791 --> 01:43:02,583
I will conduct some experiments.

799
01:43:03,666 --> 01:43:06,583
I am sure your son will be fine.

800
01:43:07,916 --> 01:43:09,416
As you wish.

801
01:43:09,708 --> 01:43:13,875
For this, I'll have to... sedate Neeraj.

802
01:43:14,166 --> 01:43:16,458
And I need your approval.

803
01:43:17,375 --> 01:43:20,666
Please read this paper and sign it.

804
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:24,875
I just want my son back,
just help him get better.

805
01:43:25,083 --> 01:43:27,291
I am ready to sign wherever you want.

806
01:43:57,125 --> 01:43:58,333
What have you decided?

807
01:43:58,750 --> 01:43:59,958
How will you do it?

808
01:44:00,458 --> 01:44:01,541
I will do it.

809
01:44:03,583 --> 01:44:05,208
Rahul will never come back.

810
01:44:06,541 --> 01:44:08,375
Can I be of any help?

811
01:44:11,541 --> 01:44:13,041
Give me that talisman.

812
01:44:14,291 --> 01:44:16,083
I never took it off.

813
01:44:16,666 --> 01:44:17,791
Why do you want it?

814
01:44:18,708 --> 01:44:22,458
I am going with Neeraj
and I am scared.

815
01:44:23,750 --> 01:44:25,166
I will return it by evening.

816
01:44:43,791 --> 01:44:44,791
Thank you.

817
01:44:54,416 --> 01:44:55,833
-Reena.
<span style="style.default_1">-Yes.</span>

818
01:44:56,125 --> 01:44:57,458
Send Dr. Kamath in.

819
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,291
<span style="style.default_1">-Immediately.</span>
-Yes, ma'am.

820
01:45:18,125 --> 01:45:20,166
Give this injection to Neeraj.

821
01:45:21,166 --> 01:45:25,416
And bring him to Hotel Meghdoot
30 minutes after sedating him.

822
01:45:25,708 --> 01:45:27,791
I've already spoken
with the hotel manager.

823
01:45:28,208 --> 01:45:31,666
I want to try some experiments
with him in that environment.

824
01:45:35,625 --> 01:45:39,250
No, I want to be alone with him.

825
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:25,083
Put him here.

826
01:48:11,333 --> 01:48:13,791
<span style="style.default_1">Hello, Control Room calling.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">PCR Van 2.</span>

827
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:18,458
There's a dead body in Hotel Meghdoot,
Bandra, room 706.

828
01:48:23,083 --> 01:48:25,083
<span style="style.default_1">Control room calling.</span>

829
01:48:25,208 --> 01:48:27,083
<span style="style.default_1">PCR Van 2. PCR Van 2.</span>

830
01:49:23,208 --> 01:49:26,166
Rahul, I am coming to you.

831
01:49:27,708 --> 01:49:29,291
Please let this child go.

832
01:49:29,375 --> 01:49:30,833
Please let him go.

833
01:50:15,916 --> 01:50:19,083
<span style="style.default_1">Rahul, love is just a chemical reaction.</span>

834
01:50:50,083 --> 01:50:51,083
Rahul.

835
01:50:56,541 --> 01:50:58,083
I knew you would come.

836
01:51:08,958 --> 01:51:10,666
Let's go from here.

837
01:52:52,541 --> 01:52:54,916
Preeti, get some ice.

838
01:53:25,208 --> 01:53:26,208
Ice.

839
01:53:33,750 --> 01:53:37,000
Did you hear the chime of an anklet?

840
01:53:37,083 --> 01:53:39,791
No, I didn't hear anything.

841
01:53:41,500 --> 01:53:42,666
You see...

842
01:53:43,166 --> 01:53:44,958
I was wearing an anklet
only on one of my legs.

843
01:53:49,500 --> 01:53:50,875
So I took it off.

844
01:54:19,333 --> 01:54:25,750
<span style="style.default_1">These fallacious eyes</span>

845
01:54:32,666 --> 01:54:38,666
<span style="style.default_1">I almost killed my beloved</span>

846
01:54:45,375 --> 01:54:51,458
<span style="style.default_1">Let's go to the court</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Oh brave warrior</span>

847

848
01:55:23,958 --> 01:55:30,083
<span style="style.default_1">I gave him my life</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Got betrayal in return</span>

849
01:55:36,791 --> 01:55:43,125
<span style="style.default_1">This is love at its best</span>
<span style="style.default_1">A spectacle nevertheless</span>

850
01:55:52,541 --> 01:55:58,916
<span style="style.default_1">He dared to break my heart</span>

851
01:56:05,916 --> 01:56:11,791
<span style="style.default_1">And I killed him in return</span>

852
01:56:31,416 --> 01:56:37,541
<span style="style.default_1">He swept me off my feet, cast a spell</span>

853
01:56:44,541 --> 01:56:50,500
<span style="style.default_1">Enchanted, I followed him</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Couldn't even repel</span>

854

<span style="style.default_1">On my way to bliss</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Something broke the spell</span>

855
01:57:13,416 --> 01:57:19,375
