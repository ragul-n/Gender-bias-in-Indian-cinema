1
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:18,708
Once upon a time...

2
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:21,833
man lived for a
hundred years without any trouble.

3
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,500
But today...

4
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:26,958
he has blood pressure
and diabetes at the age of 30.

5
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,083
He has a heart attack when he's 40.

6
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:35,041
And by the time he's 50,
he's scared to live.

7
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:41,375
Because fertilizers
and pesticides are harmful to mankind.

8
00:01:43,916 --> 00:01:45,500
But where does it go?

9
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:48,333
It is absorbed by the crop.

10
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:51,416
It gets sucked into the soil.

11
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:54,583
When it rains, it is
discharged into the streams.

12
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,916
The food we eat and the water
we drink is contaminated.

13
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,875
If this persists...

14
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:06,541
man can't live more than 30 years.

15
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:10,708
Let's put an end to this.

16
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:13,708
Let's turn to organic farming.

17
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:18,458
We at Bheeshma Organics will
teach you the ways of irrigation.

18
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:23,125
We will protect your harvest
from the greedy dealers.

19
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:27,916
We will also buy your produce
at a higher market price.

20
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,083
A lot of farmers have
collaborated with us.

21
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:34,291
If you join us in this endeavor...

22
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:36,958
together we can welcome a bright future.

23
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:41,291
Sir, all the hard work that I put in
is for my children's future.

24
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:44,125
Why would I risk that?

25
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:50,625
We will take an oath to stay away
from fertilizers and pesticides.

26
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:52,708
We will let you handle our crops.

27
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,291
You show great concern
for the future generations.

28
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:59,125
What are your plans
for the future of your company?

29
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,083
You're a one-man army.

30
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:04,208
Who's going to take over
your company after you?

31
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:06,208
When will you announce the next CEO?

32
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:11,083
Bheeshma Organics will be celebrating
its 50th anniversary soon.

33
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,125
I will make the announcement
on that occasion.

34
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:14,833
Sir, whom can we expect as the next CEO?

35
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:21,833
Their qualities matter more
than their qualifications.

36
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:28,875
On the hunt for the next CEO
to his 70 years of solitude and lineage...

37
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,958
it's Bheeshma Organics' MD Sri Bheeshma.

38
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,166
Sir, I don't have any qualification...

39
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:42,833
but I have a great deal of qualities.

40
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:46,375
You knew that when you
made me a board member.

41
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:50,500
I'm ready to take any
responsibility that you'll give me, sir.

42
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,708
Don't take much stress at this age, sir.

43
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,166
I'm here for you.

44
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:11,333
All of them are passionate
about my company, Murthy.

45
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:15,375
I'm looking for someone who is
passionate about my ambition.

46
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,875
Darn!

47
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,083
Where did he go?

48
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,083
Any problem?

49
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,041
-I don't have a girlfriend, bro.
-What went wrong, sir?

50
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:29,125
Are you here to seek revenge?

51
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,666
Or to save your abducted girlfriend?

52
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,708
I'm here to find a new girlfriend.

53
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,083
What do you need the rod for?

54
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,916
Oh, this? Stray dogs take
over our street at midnight.

55
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,500
Safety purposes, dude.

56
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,041
What about the blood?

57
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:42,666
Yes.

58
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:47,083
Oh, no! It's the sauce
from the sandwich I had earlier.

59
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,666
Sir, don't trust your online friends.

60
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:01,458
What's your job?

61
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:04,458
Giving massages to people passing through.
So, stop passing around messages.

62
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:09,208
I can understand plants' feelings.

63
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,541
Judging people is a cake walk for me.

64
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,666
Do you know who he is?

65
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:16,208
He's a noble man who likes comments...

66
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,833
and shares all my posts.

67
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:21,916
You could grovel at my feet
and it still wouldn't be enough.

68
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,416
-Such an idiot! Let's go, bro. Come on.
-Yeah, let's go.

69
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,333
What's the party for, bro?

70
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:32,000
A girl showed up for an interview
and our boss offered to marry her.

71
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,208
She agreed.

72
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:37,958
He was so floored by it, I can't tell you.

73
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:40,375
Where's the girl?

74
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,750
Wow! Amazing, bro!

75
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,916
An instrument is of no worth...

76
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:11,708
if it's played by a loser.

77
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:14,833
They used to call me an expert
musician when I was a kid.

78
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:19,750
Baby, you look so hot.
How could you say yes to him?

79
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:23,416
Because I'm yet to come across
a rich man who's handsome.

80
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,958
He looks like a dog shivering in the snow.

81
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:37,500
You're the most eligible
bachelor in our office.

82
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,500
Bro, sir is over here.

83
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:46,625
Hold on. He's looking at my fiancé.
Don't stop him.

84
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:48,833
I want everyone to speak
volumes of my achievement.

85
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:57,375
When you buy a new underwear,
you must put it on privately.

86
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,416
You shouldn't flaunt it in public.

87
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:19,375
Come on, sir!

88
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,250
He got so worked up about a handshake?

89
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,833
Look at her hand. It's so red!

90
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,083
If he's treating her badly
at the pre-wedding party...

91
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,958
imagine what he would
do after the wedding.

92
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:30,958
He's joking.

93
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:34,208
She's so precious, he should treasure her.

94
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,250
If a girl like her came into my life...

95
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,250
I would give her all my wealth.

96
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:41,208
I'd put her in a palace
and treat her like a princess.

97
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,500
Like a fricking princess!

98
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,833
Hey! The parking lot is that way.

99
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,208
Do you have a car?

100
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:04,625
Then, what do you need
the parking lot for? Come on!

101
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:07,125
Let's go.

102
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:11,666
-How many crores do you have?
-I have two more at home.

103
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,375
Blue and black.

104
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,291
What's wrong, Sara?
Are you out of breath?

105
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:18,458
No. I feel like crying.

106
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,625
You said you're an IAS.
Don't you have any money?

107
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:23,291
Yeah. IAS means, "I am single."

108
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,791
You guys seem to be drunk
and fooling around.

109
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,791
Show me your license. Come on!

110
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,500
Sir! He is kidnapping me!

111
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,791
Don't spare him, sir.
Show him what you're made of.

112
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:50,541
Show him!

113
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,458
<span style="style.center_1">You're so done for!</span>

114
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:55,000
Aren't you afraid of us at all?

115
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,250
How dare you drink and drive!

116
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,916
If you repeat this, mind you,
I'll break your legs!

117
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,833
Sir, don't trust your online friends.

118
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:01,833
Shame on me!

119
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:04,583
That bouncer turned out
to be smarter than me.

120
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,125
-How could you--
-Hey!

121
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:11,291
How could you run away
with my boss's fiancé?

122
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:12,583
Out of frustration, bro.

123
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,291
Why are you frustrated?

124
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:45,916
<span style="style.center_1">From high class to low class,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">I've had crushes on everyone</span>

125
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,416
<span style="style.center_1">There are thousands of them</span>

126
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:50,875
<span style="style.center_1">Yet, I couldn't flatter anyone</span>

127
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,416
<span style="style.center_1">I've been craving to kiss and hug a girl</span>

128
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:58,208
<span style="style.center_1">I've been chasing girls</span>

129
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,541
<span style="style.center_1">I've been begging for romance all my life</span>

130
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:06,708
<span style="style.center_1">How long do I have to be single?</span>

131
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,583
<span style="style.center_1">No girl wants me as her boyfriend</span>

132
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:16,250
<span style="style.center_1">There's nothing I can do</span>
<span style="style.center_1">To change my single status</span>

133
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:20,375
<span style="style.center_1">No Cinderella ever looks into my eyes</span>

134
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:24,541
<span style="style.center_1">I'm single and ready to mingle</span>

135
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:27,500
<span style="style.center_1">My life is colorless</span>

136
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,958
<span style="style.center_1">Add color to it, sweetheart</span>

137
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:34,541
<span style="style.center_1">I go insane when I look at couples</span>

138
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:37,333
<span style="style.center_1">I fume with jealousy</span>

139
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:40,875
<span style="style.center_1">Cool me down, darling</span>

140
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,916
-Hey, where are you going?
-I have my music and dance classes.

141
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:44,708
<span style="style.center_1">I feel lonely and I wonder why</span>

142
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:49,375
<span style="style.center_1">When will my Goddess of Love show up?</span>

143
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:54,500
<span style="style.center_1">Will the time ever be gracious with me?</span>

144
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:58,416
<span style="style.center_1">I regret having such a horrible fate</span>

145
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:09,916
<span style="style.center_1">I'm single and ready to mingle</span>

146
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,750
<span style="style.center_1">My life is colorless</span>

147
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:15,333
<span style="style.center_1">Add color to it, sweetheart</span>

148
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:19,750
<span style="style.center_1">I go insane when I look at couples</span>

149
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,666
<span style="style.center_1">I fume with jealousy</span>

150
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:26,375
<span style="style.center_1">Cool me down, darling</span>

151
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm such a fool for taking you
to a pub when you're so desperate.

152
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,833
I should just hit myself!

153
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:03,666
-I should just hit myself!
-Hey! Can't wait for us to hit you?

154
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:08,416
I'm begging you, man.

155
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,291
I brought you to this pub...

156
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:14,708
but you must have a friend
to save you from this situation.

157
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:15,916
Call him, please.

158
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:17,541
I don't have any friends, bro.

159
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,583
Are you kidding me?

160
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,916
How can you not have any friends?
Give me your phone.

161
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,000
-Trust me, bro.
-Give me that.

162
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:25,250
No friends, my foot!

163
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:36,291
Mom, Dad, me, watchman
and water delivery boy?

164
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,875
A phone with just five contacts?

165
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:41,875
-I have two more contacts, bro.
-That's not the point, man.

166
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:46,166
How unlucky am I to have met you!

167
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:48,333
Oh, God! I should stay away from you.

168
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,083
-You're a bloodsucker, man.
-Did I just hear you cuss?

169
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:51,416
I said sucker, sir. Bloodsucker!

170
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,333
Where is today's youth headed?

171
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,416
They booze until midnight
and get arrested for eve-teasing.

172
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:00,375
TV 5's Special Focus on
the irresponsible youth of India.

173
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,083
<span style="style.center_1">What is he doing here?</span>

174
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:07,791
Hey! Turn the camera off.

175
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:11,500
Again?

176
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,958
I thought she's almost flattered, Uncle.

177
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:17,750
Hey! I've used my media influence
more to get you out of trouble...

178
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,500
than for my own growth.

179
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:21,958
Please do something, Uncle.

180
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:24,708
Alright.

181
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,208
I know it's risky.

182
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,291
But I'll try talking to a dangerous guy.

183
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:29,750
This is your last chance.

184
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:40,666
Tell me.

185
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,416
Deva! Sorry to disturb you, man.

186
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:48,000
One of my relatives got arrested in
Madhapur due to a misunderstanding.

187
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:50,375
They're humiliating him on the road.

188
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:51,916
If you could talk to them once...

189
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,333
I'll do it only because
you're my classmate.

190
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:57,333
Never ask me for such favors again.

191
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,500
Bring him to my place tomorrow
at nine o'clock.

192
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,583
What's your name?

193
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,958
No. You should say, "Bheeshma, sir."

194
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:14,083
I don't think it's right
to add "Sir" to my name.

195
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:17,833
-Hey!
-What?

196
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:20,250
He's asking you to address him as "Sir."

197
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:21,916
Oh, really?

198
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:23,458
-I--
-Hey!

199
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,166
What do you do?

200
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,833
I make memes.

201
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:30,041
-What's that?
-It's like...

202
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,916
Hyderabad-Secunderabad-Nizamabad...
Single’s life <span style="style.center_1">Zindabad</span>!

203
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:35,583
I post such memes on social media.

204
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:39,000
You know what? I also received
the "Best Meme Creator" award.

205
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:42,458
He says it like it's an honor.

206
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,708
I can't believe I broke my rules
to have this guy released.

207
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:49,208
He's innocent.

208
00:16:50,416 --> 00:16:51,708
I'll enlighten him.

209
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,125
Send him to my station
for a month, from tomorrow.

210
00:16:56,375 --> 00:17:00,625
He will automatically learn
discipline and responsibility.

211
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,000
-Uncle, I was just--
-Hey, one month isn't possible.

212
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,291
Please, man.

213
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:08,708
No one in the city says no to me.

214
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,625
Hey! Stop it!

215
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:18,583
-I'll kill you!
-You call yourself a police officer?

216
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:19,958
Stop it! Please!

217
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,291
He'll kill him if he
finds out he's my son.

218
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,833
That is why, I told him
he's my relative's son.

219
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,000
Whatever it is...

220
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:30,416
I don't want to send my son to Deva.

221
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:34,250
He didn't give us an option.
It was an order.

222
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:37,458
If we don't send him,
he'll have me arrested.

223
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:41,125
I thought he'd give him a warning.

224
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,958
But instead, he decided to train him.

225
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:55,333
ACP wanted to see me.
Which way do I go?

226
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:57,541
You don't have to go anywhere.
Just turn around.

227
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:02,958
He's really active on social media.

228
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,166
Keep him active in our station as well.

229
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,750
Use him for anything you'd like.

230
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:11,666
Okay, sir.

231
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,875
What does that mean, sir?
Are you going to make me clean tables?

232
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,208
You won't be doing such heavy
duty on your first day.

233
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,166
What does that mean?

234
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,875
You'll burn your hand if you
hold the glass in the center.

235
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:30,083
It's common sense.

236
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,833
Got it!

237
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,458
-Did it burn that bad, sir?
-Yes.

238
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,458
There are innumerable names in the epics.

239
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:55,833
Why'd you name me after
the lifetime bachelor Bheeshma?

240
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:58,083
Maybe, that is why I can't find a girl.

241
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,791
When you're like this,
of course, no girl will date you.

242
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:04,916
What's wrong with me?

243
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:09,583
You have so many backlogs
in your degree. I--

244
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:13,958
Stop it, Mom. I'd rather get beaten
up by him than argue with you.

245
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:15,666
Eat this.

246
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,791
I wonder how he is going
to torture me today.

247
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,833
The driver is on leave for four days.

248
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:33,875
Hyderabad's youth is spoiled.

249
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:37,125
See how they're wasting time,
chatting on the roads.

250
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,750
None of them have the determination
to be successful in life.

251
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,000
Just like you.

252
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:45,625
Why are you smirking?

253
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,791
What's so funny?

254
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:50,833
Sir, just because a bunch
of friends are chilling...

255
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:54,000
it doesn't necessarily mean
they're jobless or directionless.

256
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,750
No one can predict where any
of them is going to end up in life.

257
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:03,208
Modi also must've been
belittled when he sold tea.

258
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:07,541
My opinion about you will not change,
no matter what you say.

259
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,208
What's in an opinion, sir?

260
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,000
It'll change according to the situation.

261
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:14,208
School bell sounds
frustrating in the morning.

262
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:16,583
But kids desperately wait for
that bell to ring in the evening.

263
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:17,791
The bell sounds the same.

264
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,541
But our opinion changes.

265
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:24,166
Alright.

266
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:27,375
Drop me at the academy
and go back to the station.

267
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:40,291
<span style="style.center_1">Where are you headed all alone?</span>

268
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,291
I thought I had no luck with the ladies.

269
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,208
Now, add songs to that list as well.

270
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:36,666
Tell me.

271
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:39,666
My car is troubling me.
I have to go to Vikarabad.

272
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:42,458
It can't get any safer than a police car.

273
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:43,791
Come.

274
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,041
I have my friends with me.

275
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,708
No worries. We have seats in the back.

276
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,041
Come.

277
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,083
Shall we move?

278
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:17,541
-They're Ragini, Sitara and--
-What do you do?

279
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:20,375
We work for Bheeshma Organics.

280
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:23,125
Hey! I didn't know there was
a company with my name.

281
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:27,666
But why are you headed to Vikarabad?

282
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:30,250
We work in the office
and stores on week days.

283
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:32,833
We have farmer interaction
programs on weekends.

284
00:22:34,916 --> 00:22:37,750
I'd watch a lot of <span style="style.center_1">Padutha Teeyaga</span>
and Omkar's shows--

285
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:39,000
<span style="style.center_1">How to flirt?</span>

286
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:42,666
<span style="style.center_1">First, pretend to be interested</span>
<span style="style.center_1">in whatever she does.</span>

287
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:43,708
<span style="style.center_1">After that--</span>

288
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:46,375
You're just making it worse for me.

289
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:50,291
Shall we move?

290
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:05,875
How did your car break down?

291
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:09,458
-What happened is...
-Yeah?

292
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,916
We hit the railing on
the side of the road.

293
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,833
Oh!

294
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:19,708
So, you were in a car crash?

295
00:23:20,583 --> 00:23:21,416
Yeah.

296
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:23,833
Actually, I'm supposed to arrest you.

297
00:23:23,916 --> 00:23:27,208
But you asked me for help, so...

298
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:28,458
You are...

299
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:32,125
-Me?
-Yes.

300
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,375
Why are you hiding the details from us?

301
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:42,333
Come to the station.
You can see everything in detail.

302
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:44,125
Shut up.

303
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:47,541
Please don't file a case on me, sir.

304
00:23:47,666 --> 00:23:51,041
It will jeopardize my career.
My family will make a big scene out of it.

305
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:54,000
My life will be ruined, sir.
Please, don't do it.

306
00:23:55,416 --> 00:23:56,750
Our lives will be ruined.

307
00:23:56,833 --> 00:23:58,375
Our families can't know about this.

308
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:03,208
I'll stay with you until
evening and observe you.

309
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:05,625
-If I like your behavior--
-You'll definitely like it, sir.

310
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:06,625
-Really?
-Yes!

311
00:24:16,708 --> 00:24:18,125
I'm passing it to you. Hold on.

312
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:22,583
Sir, we have an interaction
with the farmers.

313
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:25,375
-If you give us permission--
-Permission? Let me join you personally.

314
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:26,333
Let's go.

315
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:29,291
-Hey!
-What?

316
00:24:29,708 --> 00:24:31,500
Did they just get down from a police car?

317
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:34,625
Maybe, they're prostitutes.

318
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:38,208
-What's the price of that girl in yellow?
-Go find out, dude.

319
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:40,041
You're the MLA's son. You can't be scared.

320
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:41,666
Hey, girl!

321
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,250
What's your price?

322
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:49,000
Tell me. I'll sell an acre and pay you.

323
00:24:50,791 --> 00:24:53,208
What a hottie! She's so sexy, man.

324
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:19,791
<span style="style.center_1">Did I get emotional?</span>
<span style="style.center_1">What If she doesn't like fights?</span>

325
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:21,750
<span style="style.center_1">Boy, back down!</span>

326
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:28,458
-What is he doing?
-He must've gotten scared.

327
00:25:31,416 --> 00:25:33,791
It was blocking the way,
So, I pulled it.

328
00:25:35,666 --> 00:25:38,208
I thought you were more like a Super Cop.

329
00:25:38,541 --> 00:25:40,333
I was expecting you to thrash them.

330
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:51,458
So, she expected me to beat them up?

331
00:26:03,833 --> 00:26:04,750
Hey, hey!

332
00:26:05,791 --> 00:26:07,958
-He's back with something.
-What?

333
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:10,208
Nothing to worry.

334
00:26:10,291 --> 00:26:13,500
He'll come, drop it in the pit
and dust his hands off.

335
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:15,458
Such a show-off!

336
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:24,416
Hey, I'm an emotional guy.

337
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,125
I can't control my emotions...

338
00:26:27,208 --> 00:26:30,291
nor can I control myself from beating
someone if they provoke me.

339
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:34,291
You passed a comment,
I didn't like it, so I beat you.

340
00:26:35,583 --> 00:26:36,458
That's all.

341
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:39,250
Did he hit you hard?

342
00:26:39,791 --> 00:26:43,666
I beat you just because of those
comments you made earlier.

343
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,041
All these guys seem to be your friends.

344
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:48,833
Nobody reacted when I hit you.

345
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,833
You are a good guy.

346
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,666
Get up!

347
00:26:56,541 --> 00:26:57,666
-Let's beat them.
-Hey!

348
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,541
We are not reacting just because
you are a police officer.

349
00:27:00,625 --> 00:27:01,750
Whom are you calling police?

350
00:27:02,041 --> 00:27:04,041
I just drive a police car.

351
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:05,708
I'm a driver.

352
00:27:10,958 --> 00:27:11,875
Hey, you!

353
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:33,208
-Hey!
-Ouch!

354
00:27:33,291 --> 00:27:35,958
-Hey! What the hell, man!
-Hold on.

355
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,666
When she's here with you...

356
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,708
it's disgusting of us
to pass the comments, bro.

357
00:27:40,791 --> 00:27:42,833
That's better. Now, go play.

358
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:49,541
You should have watched me while I was
fighting with those goons.

359
00:27:56,083 --> 00:27:59,916
<span style="style.center_1">My dreams have manifested like you</span>

360
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,500
<span style="style.center_1">Is this a reality or a fantasy?</span>

361
00:28:02,583 --> 00:28:06,416
<span style="style.center_1">I have the most breathtaking dreams</span>

362
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:10,250
<span style="style.center_1">My heart and soul fly off to the skies</span>

363
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:12,916
<span style="style.center_1">Is this a reality or a fantasy?</span>

364
00:28:13,041 --> 00:28:17,333
<span style="style.center_1">This moment feels wondrous</span>

365
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,958
<span style="style.center_1">There's something I want to tell you</span>

366
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:34,541
<span style="style.center_1">There's this feeling</span>
<span style="style.center_1">That makes me want you</span>

367
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:40,500
<span style="style.center_1">There's this urge to ask you</span>
<span style="style.center_1">For something more</span>

368
00:28:40,708 --> 00:28:44,791
<span style="style.center_1">There's this desire</span>
<span style="style.center_1">To be with you forever</span>

369
00:28:44,875 --> 00:28:47,583
<span style="style.center_1">I break into a smile out of the blue</span>

370
00:28:47,666 --> 00:28:50,125
<span style="style.center_1">I'm so restless when I'm alone</span>

371
00:28:50,208 --> 00:28:55,125
<span style="style.center_1">You made me discover</span>
<span style="style.center_1">This new side to me</span>

372
00:28:55,208 --> 00:28:58,000
<span style="style.center_1">I'll be the shadow chasing you</span>

373
00:28:58,083 --> 00:29:00,541
<span style="style.center_1">I'll be the wind caressing you</span>

374
00:29:00,625 --> 00:29:06,166
<span style="style.center_1">You've cast your magic spell on me</span>

375
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:10,875
<span style="style.center_1">You've shot my heart</span>
<span style="style.center_1">With the Cupid's bow</span>

376
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:16,958
<span style="style.center_1">Now, I can't help but feel intoxicated</span>

377
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:21,416
<span style="style.center_1">But I love this sweet struggle</span>

378
00:30:09,458 --> 00:30:13,291
<span style="style.center_1">It was unexpected the way we met</span>

379
00:30:14,041 --> 00:30:19,625
<span style="style.center_1">We were destined to come together</span>

380
00:30:19,916 --> 00:30:23,833
<span style="style.center_1">I'm going insane over you</span>

381
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:30,208
<span style="style.center_1">It has become my thing</span>

382
00:30:30,583 --> 00:30:35,583
<span style="style.center_1">A level of anxiousness</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Pushes me towards you</span>

383
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:40,916
<span style="style.center_1">I feel a rush inside me</span>

384
00:30:41,083 --> 00:30:46,250
<span style="style.center_1">I never had a conflict</span>
<span style="style.center_1">With my inner self until now</span>

385
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:51,250
<span style="style.center_1">I was never like this until I met you</span>

386
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:55,625
<span style="style.center_1">You've shot my heart</span>
<span style="style.center_1">With the Cupid's bow</span>

387
00:30:56,750 --> 00:31:00,916
<span style="style.center_1">Now, I can't help but feel intoxicated</span>

388
00:31:02,041 --> 00:31:05,958
<span style="style.center_1">But I love this sweet struggle</span>

389
00:31:32,583 --> 00:31:34,125
Raghavan's research is complete.

390
00:31:34,583 --> 00:31:36,125
He's coming with the project details.

391
00:32:11,041 --> 00:32:14,041
There's a great demand
for instant things in life.

392
00:32:14,375 --> 00:32:17,416
People don't have the patience
to watch Test matches anymore.

393
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:20,458
That is why, the T20 format is a big hit.

394
00:32:20,958 --> 00:32:22,250
It's the same with businesses.

395
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,250
Everyone is looking
for more returns in less time.

396
00:32:32,166 --> 00:32:35,166
We give the farmers an instant
kit from our company.

397
00:32:35,791 --> 00:32:38,666
The kit has all the chemicals...

398
00:32:38,833 --> 00:32:43,333
that are required to grow their crop.

399
00:32:50,541 --> 00:32:56,500
This will give us 60 days
of yield in just 40 days.

400
00:32:57,625 --> 00:33:03,041
And the yield will keep on coming.

401
00:33:08,375 --> 00:33:10,583
But hormonal combinations
are dangerous, right?

402
00:33:10,875 --> 00:33:12,708
Will the government give us the
permission?

403
00:33:18,625 --> 00:33:20,500
It all comes down
to what we have to offer.

404
00:33:23,291 --> 00:33:24,916
The minister loved this ideology.

405
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,416
We'll get the permission.

406
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:33,958
Bheeshma is urging everyone
to take up organic farming.

407
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,208
He will create trouble.

408
00:33:36,666 --> 00:33:38,916
Let it be the other way around this time.

409
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,666
We have to create problems for him.

410
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:48,041
This product promises 200 percent
results on the organic soil.

411
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:55,166
So, if we grab the customers
of Bheeshma Organics and launch it...

412
00:33:56,625 --> 00:33:58,750
there will be a great
demand for our product.

413
00:34:00,625 --> 00:34:05,250
Forget about your
competitor being better than you.

414
00:34:18,875 --> 00:34:19,916
I have a plan.

415
00:34:20,416 --> 00:34:21,291
What is it?

416
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:29,625
They'll be here in the morning.

417
00:34:30,833 --> 00:34:32,000
They'll kill the old man.

418
00:34:32,875 --> 00:34:34,375
And they'll return in the evening.

419
00:34:34,833 --> 00:34:36,500
What if they got arrested
in the afternoon?

420
00:34:41,833 --> 00:34:43,500
Stop watching films, brother.

421
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:48,791
You know that we'll be in a mess if we
kill that old man, right?

422
00:34:49,208 --> 00:34:50,416
What do you have in mind?

423
00:34:56,333 --> 00:35:01,541
Let's have an interaction
between Bheeshma and me in public.

424
00:35:01,708 --> 00:35:05,750
People's faith in him
and his organic farming...

425
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,041
Will be shattered!

426
00:35:15,291 --> 00:35:18,125
Why'd you bring me so far for vegetables?

427
00:35:18,208 --> 00:35:20,583
Mom, those vegetables are
sprayed with chemicals.

428
00:35:20,666 --> 00:35:23,250
Here, we get fresh and organic vegetables.

429
00:35:23,333 --> 00:35:25,500
We ate those vegetables all these years.
We're doing fine, right?

430
00:35:25,583 --> 00:35:28,000
Mom, Chiranjeevi was
also fine as a kid...

431
00:35:28,083 --> 00:35:29,583
when he was given poison
in <span style="style.center_1">Punnami Nagu</span>.

432
00:35:29,666 --> 00:35:32,625
He transformed into a snake later. We
can't feed our bodies with poison.

433
00:35:32,708 --> 00:35:34,458
That's fine, but why did
you bring me along?

434
00:35:34,541 --> 00:35:36,708
-What could it possibly mean?
-Who is she?

435
00:35:44,666 --> 00:35:45,750
-She's beautiful, son.
-She's beautiful, son.

436
00:35:48,291 --> 00:35:51,083
-You can continue shopping.
-And you can flirt with her.

437
00:36:05,625 --> 00:36:07,125
You are...

438
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,500
Yes.

439
00:36:12,583 --> 00:36:13,833
What are you doing here, sir?

440
00:36:15,166 --> 00:36:18,041
Forget the veggies.
He's cooking up stories there.

441
00:36:18,125 --> 00:36:19,541
Ever since I met you...

442
00:36:19,625 --> 00:36:21,291
I've developed an interest
in organic farming.

443
00:36:21,375 --> 00:36:24,208
So, I've made my parents turn organic.

444
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:39,875
Sir, the tomatoes
look so beautiful and red.

445
00:36:40,125 --> 00:36:41,458
Why do they look stale here?

446
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:45,375
Please don't talk about
beauty and color, sir.

447
00:36:46,041 --> 00:36:49,500
Look at yourself in the mirror. You'll
realize how beautiful the tomatoes are.

448
00:36:53,666 --> 00:36:55,708
You've made your
family believe in organic farming.

449
00:36:56,125 --> 00:36:57,750
I'm very happy.

450
00:36:57,916 --> 00:37:00,666
How can I know more about organic farming?

451
00:37:01,166 --> 00:37:02,125
Read these books.

452
00:37:02,208 --> 00:37:05,541
You can learn a whole lot on
how to do organic farming.

453
00:37:07,416 --> 00:37:09,166
If I want to call you
regarding any doubts...

454
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:10,166
Sure!

455
00:37:19,833 --> 00:37:21,125
I've got work at the station.

456
00:37:21,416 --> 00:37:24,375
-He does all the work over there.
-Mom, let's go.

457
00:37:24,458 --> 00:37:26,375
-He does everything but work.
-Bye, dear.

458
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:32,875
Don't stay here for long.
Somebody will take you home.

459
00:37:33,916 --> 00:37:35,291
Why'd you give him your number?

460
00:37:35,833 --> 00:37:38,000
He said he's an ACP.
I want to talk to him.

461
00:37:41,708 --> 00:37:44,291
-Yes?
-I can't find my anger management book.

462
00:37:44,625 --> 00:37:46,125
Oh, it must be on the shelf.

463
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,291
I've been looking for half an hour.

464
00:37:50,708 --> 00:37:52,458
Deva, my battery is almost dead.

465
00:37:52,833 --> 00:37:54,333
I'll reach the venue in two minutes.

466
00:37:54,541 --> 00:37:56,750
I'll ping you from my friend's
phone as soon as I reach.

467
00:37:57,125 --> 00:37:57,958
Listen--

468
00:37:58,625 --> 00:38:02,000
Handling the city is way
easier than handling your mom.

469
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,375
If my darling comes to know
I'm learning so much...

470
00:38:16,458 --> 00:38:18,291
she'll be highly impressed.

471
00:38:19,125 --> 00:38:21,625
Sweetheart, what are you doing?

472
00:38:42,666 --> 00:38:43,500
Dad...

473
00:38:44,125 --> 00:38:45,750
Text message.
I guess it's Mom.

474
00:38:47,083 --> 00:38:49,875
Not bad. She pinged in two minutes.

475
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:55,750
Stop it, Dad!

476
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,750
You're the most unromantic man, Dad.

477
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,916
Me?

478
00:39:00,291 --> 00:39:03,458
Mom texted you instead of calling you.

479
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,083
What does that mean?

480
00:39:05,625 --> 00:39:06,625
What does it mean?

481
00:39:07,166 --> 00:39:09,333
She wants to build a conversation.

482
00:39:09,875 --> 00:39:11,208
-Really?
-Yes.

483
00:39:11,333 --> 00:39:12,333
-Are you sure?
-Of course!

484
00:39:13,541 --> 00:39:14,500
Now, watch me.

485
00:39:15,625 --> 00:39:18,375
"I've been waiting for your message."

486
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:26,208
"You naughty girl!"

487
00:39:26,333 --> 00:39:27,875
"How'd you know it was me?"

488
00:39:29,875 --> 00:39:31,708
"That's the field I'm in."

489
00:39:34,083 --> 00:39:35,291
What does she mean by field?

490
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,416
Maybe, she means crop fields.

491
00:39:42,791 --> 00:39:46,666
"What's your opinion about me?
Tell me."

492
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,916
We've been together for so long.

493
00:39:51,083 --> 00:39:52,541
Why'd she still ask so many questions?

494
00:39:52,625 --> 00:39:54,208
Cool down, Dad.

495
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,916
"If I didn't have a good
opinion about you...

496
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:00,666
why would we be talking right now?"

497
00:40:06,625 --> 00:40:08,208
It's my lucky day.

498
00:40:08,958 --> 00:40:10,458
Don't beat around the bush, man.

499
00:40:10,583 --> 00:40:11,458
Just ask her.

500
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:12,708
Just ask her.

501
00:40:21,791 --> 00:40:25,583
If I said yes, she'd get upset
that I just like her.

502
00:40:26,083 --> 00:40:27,291
I won't give her that chance.

503
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:28,458
Wow!

504
00:40:55,166 --> 00:40:56,000
See that?

505
00:40:56,666 --> 00:40:58,791
She wants to see her husband right away.

506
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:00,291
Go ahead!

507
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:06,791
Yes!

508
00:41:23,708 --> 00:41:25,583
-Done with your shower?
-Why do you ask?

509
00:41:25,958 --> 00:41:27,291
Will you scrub my back?

510
00:41:29,541 --> 00:41:31,541
Why are you texting me like
I'm your wife?

511
00:41:31,791 --> 00:41:33,791
I missed your class today, sir.

512
00:41:33,916 --> 00:41:35,541
So, I was desperate to ping you.

513
00:41:35,708 --> 00:41:37,916
It doesn't seem like you
missed attending the class.

514
00:41:38,625 --> 00:41:40,416
It's more like you missed seeing me.

515
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,833
And this video call... disgusting!

516
00:41:43,166 --> 00:41:44,125
Hang up!

517
00:41:49,375 --> 00:41:50,791
Where did it go wrong?

518
00:41:59,708 --> 00:42:00,666
Greetings, sir.

519
00:42:04,583 --> 00:42:05,583
I'm talking to you, sir.

520
00:42:08,333 --> 00:42:09,791
-Greetings, sir.
-Greetings!

521
00:42:09,958 --> 00:42:10,875
Forgive me, sir.

522
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:12,750
Are you here to arrest me?

523
00:42:12,875 --> 00:42:15,208
Please don't arrest me, sir.
My life will be ruined.

524
00:42:16,458 --> 00:42:19,791
I can't begin to tell you
how unlucky I am in life.

525
00:42:19,958 --> 00:42:22,458
I pretended to be an ACP
to impress girls...

526
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:25,166
and the ACP's daughter
asked me for a lift.

527
00:42:27,416 --> 00:42:28,875
You were such a show-off.

528
00:42:30,125 --> 00:42:34,625
You showed us your PAN card
and said it was your police ID.

529
00:42:35,416 --> 00:42:37,000
-Come.
-Where?

530
00:42:37,125 --> 00:42:39,375
I heard you proposed in
the chat last night.

531
00:42:40,083 --> 00:42:41,125
Dad's waiting for you.

532
00:42:41,583 --> 00:42:44,041
He wants to divorce Mom and marry you.

533
00:42:44,125 --> 00:42:47,333
Actually, I thought that was your number.

534
00:42:48,083 --> 00:42:49,208
Did you tell him everything?

535
00:42:50,291 --> 00:42:51,291
Dad...

536
00:42:52,625 --> 00:42:53,500
Dad!

537
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:55,583
Dad!

538
00:42:55,958 --> 00:42:57,166
Let's go. Let's go.

539
00:42:58,208 --> 00:43:00,833
Sir, I'll send tomorrow's program
itinerary on WhatsApp, sir.

540
00:43:01,083 --> 00:43:04,916
No. I uninstalled WhatsApp
because of the spam video calls.

541
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:08,000
Send me via text message.

542
00:43:08,291 --> 00:43:09,166
Go.

543
00:43:15,541 --> 00:43:17,333
Why do you look dull?

544
00:43:18,791 --> 00:43:20,500
Are you active only on video calls?

545
00:43:20,958 --> 00:43:22,458
Nothing like that, sir.

546
00:43:24,666 --> 00:43:27,041
I wanted to train you
under me for a month.

547
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,750
But not anymore. You can go.

548
00:43:31,083 --> 00:43:31,916
Why, sir?

549
00:43:33,541 --> 00:43:35,958
I noticed a change in your
attitude the other day.

550
00:43:37,375 --> 00:43:41,250
I didn't know your actions had also
changed until Chaithra told me.

551
00:43:42,541 --> 00:43:47,541
I heard you give lift to strangers
and take part in their social activities.

552
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:50,541
Clear all your backlogs and get a job.

553
00:43:51,041 --> 00:43:51,958
Okay? Go.

554
00:43:52,041 --> 00:43:53,458
I haven't changed yet, sir.

555
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,166
I still have these random negative
thoughts once in a while.

556
00:43:59,041 --> 00:44:01,666
You can't leave a half-changed
man into the society.

557
00:44:01,791 --> 00:44:02,791
You can't.

558
00:44:02,916 --> 00:44:04,416
I will stay with you, sir.

559
00:44:05,791 --> 00:44:07,583
I've come across people
who are afraid of me.

560
00:44:08,041 --> 00:44:10,333
I've also come across people
who run away from me.

561
00:44:11,125 --> 00:44:12,083
But for the first time...

562
00:44:12,166 --> 00:44:15,583
I've come across someone
who wants to learn from me.

563
00:44:18,083 --> 00:44:20,000
You can stay for as long as you wish.

564
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:26,500
Hey! I didn't want my
Dad to trouble anyone.

565
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:29,458
So, I thought of putting in
a good word for you to go away.

566
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:30,875
But you want to stay?

567
00:44:30,958 --> 00:44:33,166
I don't get to see you if I go away.

568
00:44:33,333 --> 00:44:34,375
Why do you want to see me?

569
00:44:34,958 --> 00:44:36,625
Tell me! Why do you want to see me?

570
00:44:38,041 --> 00:44:40,166
Dad's a police and daughter's a liar.

571
00:44:40,291 --> 00:44:44,250
-Don't you know why I want to see you?
-Don't try to get intimate with me, okay?

572
00:44:44,333 --> 00:44:45,500
Want me to tell Dad?

573
00:44:46,333 --> 00:44:47,250
Dad...

574
00:44:48,166 --> 00:44:49,083
Dad...

575
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:51,166
Dad!

576
00:44:52,083 --> 00:44:54,166
Chaithra! You don't have your car, right?

577
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:56,375
Bheeshma, drop her at work.

578
00:45:12,833 --> 00:45:13,666
Miss Chaithra...

579
00:45:14,083 --> 00:45:15,125
may I leave now?

580
00:45:15,375 --> 00:45:17,125
-No, wait.
-For how long?

581
00:45:17,666 --> 00:45:18,500
Until evening.

582
00:45:18,875 --> 00:45:20,208
Why? Any problem?

583
00:45:20,541 --> 00:45:22,750
I'll take a nap.
I'll lie down right here.

584
00:45:22,958 --> 00:45:24,041
Do you have any problem?

585
00:45:26,583 --> 00:45:30,958
Organic products have a good demand
not only in India, but also abroad.

586
00:45:31,666 --> 00:45:35,416
I feel it'd be great if we
start exporting our products.

587
00:45:36,791 --> 00:45:38,125
What do you think, Chaithra?

588
00:45:38,875 --> 00:45:42,666
You started this company for our
farmers and our motherland, sir.

589
00:45:42,958 --> 00:45:45,916
No doubt our business will expand
if we start exporting our stuff.

590
00:45:46,083 --> 00:45:49,458
But it will remain a mere
business if we do so.

591
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:52,541
We can offer higher prices
to the farmers if we start exporting.

592
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:56,208
As important as it is to offer
a good price to the farmers...

593
00:45:56,791 --> 00:46:00,291
it is equally important to offer
good produce to our people.

594
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,250
You said what we were thinking.

595
00:46:13,333 --> 00:46:14,916
You guys are unbelievable.

596
00:46:15,583 --> 00:46:17,291
We came up with the idea together, right?

597
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:19,125
But you took his side as soon as
he countered me.

598
00:46:19,208 --> 00:46:22,208
You're nothing less. You presented
our collective idea as your own.

599
00:46:22,875 --> 00:46:23,708
Whatever.

600
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,125
No matter whom he announces
as the next CEO...

601
00:46:26,625 --> 00:46:30,666
let's back that person
and grab our own share.

602
00:46:31,083 --> 00:46:33,916
Are you sure he'll make
one of us the next CEO?

603
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:35,708
He doesn't have any option.

604
00:46:36,166 --> 00:46:38,458
He can't find a better worker
than anyone of us.

605
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:06,666
Did you want to see me, sir?

606
00:47:08,375 --> 00:47:09,250
No.

607
00:47:12,583 --> 00:47:14,583
You came anyway. Open the bottle.

608
00:47:17,291 --> 00:47:19,000
Wow! That was great.

609
00:47:19,791 --> 00:47:21,208
Do you drink much?

610
00:47:21,333 --> 00:47:22,625
Not at all, sir.

611
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:25,125
Sometimes I drink when I feel
low about failing my degree.

612
00:47:25,208 --> 00:47:27,833
But recently, I've been
feeling low every day, sir.

613
00:47:28,416 --> 00:47:30,666
You shouldn't feel low
if you fail your degree, Bheeshma.

614
00:47:30,875 --> 00:47:32,375
You should feel low when
you fail in your life.

615
00:47:32,458 --> 00:47:34,250
Come. Sit down.

616
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:35,916
Oh, no! I can't sit with you, sir.

617
00:47:36,291 --> 00:47:38,125
But you sit beside me
in the car every day.

618
00:47:39,333 --> 00:47:40,250
Sit!

619
00:47:45,958 --> 00:47:46,833
Have a peg.

620
00:47:47,833 --> 00:47:50,666
-I lead a disciplined life, Bheeshma.
-Right!

621
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:00,416
Hey! I meant chicken legs.

622
00:48:04,833 --> 00:48:05,708
Drink it.

623
00:48:06,458 --> 00:48:09,458
No, sir. All I can think
of are memes when I drink.

624
00:48:09,791 --> 00:48:11,541
Oh, really? Tell me one.

625
00:48:20,958 --> 00:48:23,083
"Shake it up and down,
ACP sir is the Don in town."

626
00:48:26,041 --> 00:48:28,208
Nice! One more.

627
00:48:28,375 --> 00:48:30,291
-I'll get the ice cubes.
-Go. Go.

628
00:48:37,458 --> 00:48:38,458
Miss Chaithra...

629
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:40,833
Dad's asking for ice cubes.

630
00:48:41,041 --> 00:48:42,458
Where can I find them?

631
00:48:42,583 --> 00:48:44,208
In my pocket. Come, take them.

632
00:48:44,416 --> 00:48:45,708
Pocket? Which pocket?

633
00:48:45,791 --> 00:48:46,625
Hey!

634
00:48:47,208 --> 00:48:48,416
Where can one find ice cubes?

635
00:48:49,208 --> 00:48:50,875
In the fridge, obviously. Go!

636
00:48:58,250 --> 00:48:59,166
Where's the ice?

637
00:48:59,416 --> 00:49:02,250
I was worried we'd catch cold, sir.
So, I came back.

638
00:49:02,791 --> 00:49:05,875
Tell me something powerful this time.

639
00:49:06,541 --> 00:49:08,541
A powerful meme...

640
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:11,333
Got it.

641
00:49:12,291 --> 00:49:14,041
-"Hero Honda, Splendor..."
-Okay.

642
00:49:14,166 --> 00:49:15,208
-Listen to this.
-Yes.

643
00:49:15,375 --> 00:49:16,708
"Hero Honda, Splendor..."

644
00:49:16,791 --> 00:49:18,083
our ACP sir is like thunder!"

645
00:49:25,541 --> 00:49:28,083
I miss having such
entertainment while boozing.

646
00:49:28,541 --> 00:49:30,291
Tell me more.

647
00:49:30,375 --> 00:49:31,833
-I'll get a soda.
-Alright, go.

648
00:49:32,541 --> 00:49:33,416
Here you go.

649
00:49:34,375 --> 00:49:35,291
Okay.

650
00:49:35,375 --> 00:49:36,416
Here.

651
00:49:42,208 --> 00:49:44,250
-You've decided to go, right?
-Yes.

652
00:49:44,708 --> 00:49:46,500
Naughty fellow! Go!

653
00:49:47,625 --> 00:49:49,333
-Actually...
-What?

654
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:53,458
Sir wants some pickle
to go with the drinks.

655
00:49:53,833 --> 00:49:55,416
Where can I find it?

656
00:49:55,541 --> 00:49:56,916
What's your problem?

657
00:49:57,333 --> 00:49:58,916
Sir asked for it.

658
00:49:59,208 --> 00:50:01,458
Dad neither needs ice cubes...

659
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:03,708
nor does he eat pickles.

660
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:07,541
If you disturb me by taking
my dad's name again...

661
00:50:08,375 --> 00:50:10,791
I'll shoot you right away.

662
00:50:13,666 --> 00:50:15,291
How's your love story coming along?

663
00:50:15,458 --> 00:50:16,791
It will definitely work out, Dad.

664
00:50:16,875 --> 00:50:19,791
But I feel sorry for Uncle.

665
00:50:20,041 --> 00:50:21,458
Why? What happened to him?

666
00:50:21,791 --> 00:50:23,750
-He only put me under the ACP, right?
-Yes.

667
00:50:23,833 --> 00:50:25,708
His daughter is the girl
I'm in love with.

668
00:50:31,541 --> 00:50:33,750
-Is it really Deva?
-Yeah! It's him!

669
00:50:33,958 --> 00:50:35,625
My classmate.

670
00:50:35,916 --> 00:50:40,333
He created ruckus just because
our son touched his daughter.

671
00:50:40,416 --> 00:50:41,291
Are you out of your mind?

672
00:50:41,375 --> 00:50:43,750
What if he finds out about
our son's love story?

673
00:50:50,166 --> 00:50:52,666
I read the Earth goes round and round.

674
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,958
He proved it by ending up
with the first girl again.

675
00:50:57,125 --> 00:50:58,416
We should blame him.

676
00:50:58,583 --> 00:51:00,791
He put him under Deva
despite us saying no.

677
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:03,833
Hey! Cool down and tell me what happened.

678
00:51:05,125 --> 00:51:07,541
He's in love with Deva's daughter.

679
00:51:22,333 --> 00:51:25,375
Is it going to be chemical
farming or organic farming?

680
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:27,291
To discuss further on this topic...

681
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:28,916
-we have with us today...
-Program will be over in an hour.

682
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:34,833
Field Science's MD Mr. Raghavan
and Bheeshma Organics' MD Mr. Bheeshma.

683
00:51:35,166 --> 00:51:36,375
Let's hear from them...

684
00:51:36,458 --> 00:51:41,125
some interesting facts about chemical
farming and organic farming.

685
00:51:44,375 --> 00:51:46,583
Hey, Parimal! What are you doing here?

686
00:51:46,833 --> 00:51:47,791
I should ask you that.

687
00:51:48,333 --> 00:51:50,125
What are you doing here?
Are you here for the show?

688
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:51,750
I don't care about the show, bro.

689
00:51:51,833 --> 00:51:52,791
I'm here for her.

690
00:51:53,708 --> 00:51:54,750
Beautiful, isn't she?

691
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:58,708
When will you stop fooling
around with girls?

692
00:51:58,791 --> 00:52:04,166
I lost my job because of you and joined
Field Science for a much lesser salary.

693
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,666
Which crop are you producing, old man?

694
00:52:09,041 --> 00:52:10,250
Chilli, sir.

695
00:52:10,416 --> 00:52:14,208
Did you use any fertilizers or
leave the results up to God?

696
00:52:14,541 --> 00:52:16,125
I used your company's fertilizers, sir.

697
00:52:16,291 --> 00:52:17,583
I've gotten a really good yield.

698
00:52:17,958 --> 00:52:19,208
I'm really happy about it.

699
00:52:19,333 --> 00:52:22,833
Whatever we do is in the best interest
of the farmers, right, Mr. Bheeshma?

700
00:52:23,291 --> 00:52:24,666
What more can we ask for?

701
00:52:26,625 --> 00:52:27,958
Happiness...

702
00:52:28,208 --> 00:52:32,541
is not in the clothes you
wear or the money you make.

703
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,083
Happiness is health.

704
00:52:35,625 --> 00:52:38,041
Happiness is welcoming
the next generations.

705
00:52:38,375 --> 00:52:44,375
We can't continue the usage of fertilizers
and put Mother Nature at stake.

706
00:52:44,708 --> 00:52:46,208
You're good with words, sir.

707
00:52:48,333 --> 00:52:54,291
It was these very words that made
many farmers change their minds.

708
00:52:55,916 --> 00:53:01,458
People in Zambia, Ethiopia and ten other
countries are dying of starvation.

709
00:53:01,833 --> 00:53:02,916
Don't they have Swiggy?

710
00:53:03,625 --> 00:53:04,666
They don't have money.

711
00:53:06,375 --> 00:53:07,958
As per the increasing population...

712
00:53:08,625 --> 00:53:10,958
the yield we're getting now...

713
00:53:11,208 --> 00:53:14,916
will only feed 40 percent
of them by 2050.

714
00:53:15,416 --> 00:53:18,625
We need to bring new genetic
changes to overcome this.

715
00:53:18,875 --> 00:53:21,791
Advanced chemicals should be
made available to the farmers.

716
00:53:22,083 --> 00:53:23,250
Instead, you go on and on...

717
00:53:23,708 --> 00:53:28,625
about organic farming and happiness.

718
00:53:29,875 --> 00:53:32,708
Organic farming has gotten old.

719
00:53:33,291 --> 00:53:34,125
Just like you.

720
00:53:34,208 --> 00:53:35,333
It has gotten old?

721
00:53:35,791 --> 00:53:38,250
Do you even--

722
00:53:38,541 --> 00:53:40,541
Except for you and your company's staff...

723
00:53:41,458 --> 00:53:45,458
has a single person
denied what I just said?

724
00:53:45,708 --> 00:53:50,375
I'll accept that everyone
believes in organic farming.

725
00:53:56,875 --> 00:53:57,791
Bro...

726
00:53:58,583 --> 00:54:01,791
-What should I do now to impress her?
-Go there and speak.

727
00:54:01,875 --> 00:54:04,125
You opened your mouth and ruined my
career. She'll definitely be impressed.

728
00:54:11,958 --> 00:54:12,916
-What is he--
-No!

729
00:54:15,666 --> 00:54:16,916
Is he going to sing a song?

730
00:54:17,208 --> 00:54:18,083
Oh, God!

731
00:54:18,416 --> 00:54:19,666
You're absolutely right, sir.

732
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:22,166
Nobody out there has
an idea about organic farming...

733
00:54:22,666 --> 00:54:27,166
or about the people in Zambia
and Ethiopia dying of starvation.

734
00:54:27,333 --> 00:54:28,375
They have no idea, sir.

735
00:54:29,541 --> 00:54:32,541
You're trying to increase
production through chemicals.

736
00:54:32,791 --> 00:54:35,416
But why didn't you establish
your company in those countries?

737
00:54:38,083 --> 00:54:40,125
You would've saved them
from dying of starvation.

738
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,916
But you won't do it.
Want to know why?

739
00:54:45,166 --> 00:54:46,291
There are two reasons.

740
00:54:46,541 --> 00:54:48,833
Number one is money.
They're poor countries.

741
00:54:48,916 --> 00:54:50,208
You can't make any money there.

742
00:54:50,291 --> 00:54:51,333
Number two is soil.

743
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:54,166
Those countries don't have
the fertile soil our country offers.

744
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,416
Sir, when the soil is unfertile...

745
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,583
what's the point in using
any number of chemicals?

746
00:54:58,833 --> 00:55:01,291
Because a plant's growth
depends on the soil.

747
00:55:01,666 --> 00:55:02,916
Not on the products.

748
00:55:10,125 --> 00:55:12,791
You asked someone to speak,
but you're interrupting me now.

749
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:16,000
Do you believe in God?

750
00:55:17,833 --> 00:55:18,708
Tell me, sir.

751
00:55:22,125 --> 00:55:23,000
Damn!

752
00:55:23,333 --> 00:55:25,875
Technology has advanced rapidly
and you still believe in God?

753
00:55:27,208 --> 00:55:30,583
In that case, what's wrong in adapting
the old procedure of organic farming?

754
00:55:44,166 --> 00:55:46,791
Our Vedas and other holy transcripts...

755
00:55:47,041 --> 00:55:50,666
speak highly of organic farming that can
turn barren lands into lush green fields.

756
00:55:53,208 --> 00:55:54,750
If we follow it properly...

757
00:55:55,041 --> 00:55:58,000
we won't need any chemicals
to get a good yield.

758
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:01,708
Nature doesn't depend on mankind.

759
00:56:01,916 --> 00:56:05,250
But mankind is highly dependent
on every inch of Mother Nature.

760
00:56:05,625 --> 00:56:08,083
Please, don't ruin it with your chemicals.

761
00:56:10,291 --> 00:56:13,750
MSc Agriculture Gold Medalist
Parimal will take on.

762
00:56:31,541 --> 00:56:32,916
Yes?

763
00:56:34,166 --> 00:56:36,291
How do you know about organic farming?

764
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,250
Those books you gave me the other day...

765
00:56:38,333 --> 00:56:39,458
I read them.

766
00:56:39,833 --> 00:56:41,166
-You went through all of them?
-Yeah.

767
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:42,083
What for?

768
00:56:42,333 --> 00:56:44,708
That subject interests you, so...

769
00:56:46,791 --> 00:56:50,708
So, you've learned
the subject to impress me.

770
00:56:50,958 --> 00:56:52,625
-Am I right?
-Nothing like that.

771
00:56:52,875 --> 00:56:53,875
Are you in love with me?

772
00:56:54,083 --> 00:56:55,375
Nothing like that.

773
00:56:55,458 --> 00:56:57,458
I thought you like the subject, so...

774
00:56:58,291 --> 00:57:00,375
Alright. I'll be downstairs. See you.

775
00:57:12,958 --> 00:57:16,416
A girl doesn't need a miracle
to fall in love with a guy.

776
00:57:16,958 --> 00:57:18,833
She just has to form
a good opinion about him.

777
00:57:20,291 --> 00:57:23,500
And I had a good opinion
about you even before I met you.

778
00:57:24,666 --> 00:57:25,791
Dad.

779
00:57:26,791 --> 00:57:28,125
My car broke down.

780
00:57:31,291 --> 00:57:32,958
Hyderabad's youth is spoiled.

781
00:57:33,125 --> 00:57:35,958
<span style="style.center_1">Sir, just because a bunch</span>
<span style="style.center_1">of friends are chilling...</span>

782
00:57:36,041 --> 00:57:39,000
doesn't necessarily mean
they're jobless and directionless.

783
00:57:39,541 --> 00:57:42,625
No one can predict where any one
of them will end up in life.

784
00:57:43,208 --> 00:57:46,291
Modi also must've been
belittled when he sold tea.

785
00:57:50,583 --> 00:57:54,000
That's when I realized it
was you who spoke to Dad.

786
00:57:54,833 --> 00:57:58,916
I've been enjoying your
company ever since.

787
00:58:00,958 --> 00:58:02,916
You hit ten guys for me.

788
00:58:03,541 --> 00:58:05,416
You were with my dad for 20 days.

789
00:58:05,958 --> 00:58:08,916
You learned a new subject in 30 minutes.

790
00:58:10,583 --> 00:58:15,041
Usually, a girl feels happy to get
a guy who does things for her.

791
00:58:15,791 --> 00:58:19,583
But... when she gets a guy
who'd go that extra mile for her...

792
00:58:20,166 --> 00:58:21,458
she feels lucky.

793
00:58:44,208 --> 00:58:45,833
I'll love you for a lifetime.

794
00:59:10,625 --> 00:59:14,000
I went to a TV studio for a case study
and found Ms. Chaithra like this.

795
00:59:19,708 --> 00:59:21,250
Why is he calling me all of a sudden?

796
00:59:22,458 --> 00:59:23,583
I won't pick up.

797
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:26,833
Pick up!

798
00:59:41,166 --> 00:59:43,333
-Where's JP?
-He's at Mr. Anand's place, sir.

799
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:48,750
Did he call you again?

800
00:59:49,083 --> 00:59:52,250
When you don't answer the call twice,
no man in his senses will call back.

801
00:59:52,791 --> 00:59:53,666
Okay, I'm leaving.

802
01:00:07,958 --> 01:00:09,625
Why did you stop there?

803
01:00:22,625 --> 01:00:23,875
It's a yes from Chaithra, Mom.

804
01:00:23,958 --> 01:00:26,291
But I don't know how to convince her dad.

805
01:00:42,208 --> 01:00:45,750
Are you holding a grudge against me for
humiliating your son when he was a kid?

806
01:00:46,208 --> 01:00:48,625
Is that why you asked him
to flirt with my daughter?

807
01:00:51,125 --> 01:00:53,416
Are you behind this, JP?

808
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:55,250
No, listen to me.

809
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
I don't want to see his face.

810
01:00:59,333 --> 01:01:03,583
How did you think I'd accept
his son as my son-in-law?

811
01:01:05,333 --> 01:01:08,000
Sir, I don't remember what happened
when I was a kid.

812
01:01:08,083 --> 01:01:09,958
I really love Chaithra, sir.

813
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:11,750
What the hell!

814
01:01:13,375 --> 01:01:14,916
You're a nobody.

815
01:01:16,708 --> 01:01:18,958
He believes happiness is
doing whatever you like.

816
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:22,458
He's a loser who got nowhere
with that philosophy.

817
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:26,791
And you're his loser son.

818
01:01:28,541 --> 01:01:30,958
What are you looking at?

819
01:01:32,375 --> 01:01:33,750
You want my daughter?

820
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:37,125
Do you know what her range is?

821
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,958
She could have it easy
as the ACP's daughter...

822
01:01:41,375 --> 01:01:42,791
but she earned the top position...

823
01:01:43,208 --> 01:01:46,500
in Bheeshma Organics without
any recommendation.

824
01:01:48,875 --> 01:01:49,708
And you?

825
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:52,250
You're a rogue who
didn't clear his degree.

826
01:01:54,166 --> 01:01:57,666
You don't even deserve to be
a watchman in her company.

827
01:01:58,166 --> 01:01:59,208
You want my daughter?

828
01:02:00,875 --> 01:02:02,250
Hey! Stop it!

829
01:02:03,458 --> 01:02:04,416
What did you say?

830
01:02:04,958 --> 01:02:06,708
He doesn't even deserve to be a watchman?

831
01:02:07,583 --> 01:02:09,583
He has no reason to work as a watchman.

832
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:12,416
He's the heir to that company.

833
01:02:24,625 --> 01:02:26,166
-Dear...
-Shut up!

834
01:02:27,458 --> 01:02:30,416
I promised Mr. Bheeshma I wouldn't
let anyone belittle his grandson.

835
01:02:31,958 --> 01:02:34,708
I will not be quiet when
someone is insulting him.

836
01:02:36,791 --> 01:02:39,041
What did you say? He's a nobody?

837
01:02:40,458 --> 01:02:44,750
You're proud of the fact that your
daughter is an employee of that company.

838
01:02:45,625 --> 01:02:48,000
But he's the future CEO of that company.

839
01:02:52,666 --> 01:02:57,083
One and only grandson
of Bheeshma Organics' MD Mr. Bheeshma.

840
01:03:02,291 --> 01:03:04,833
He's the successor to his
million-dollar establishment.

841
01:03:13,958 --> 01:03:16,291
Sir, you're going to be
the CEO of such a huge company.

842
01:03:16,541 --> 01:03:17,750
How do you feel?

843
01:03:24,416 --> 01:03:26,625
<span style="style.center_1">Bheeshma Organics has announced</span>
<span style="style.center_1">its next CEO.</span>

844
01:03:27,083 --> 01:03:28,916
<span style="style.center_1">Bheeshma Organics' next CEO...</span>

845
01:03:32,416 --> 01:03:34,916
<span style="style.center_1">Is Junior Bheeshma</span>
<span style="style.center_1">the real heir to Mr. Bheeshma?</span>

846
01:03:46,333 --> 01:03:48,708
<span style="style.center_1">Is this Bheeshma the real</span>
<span style="style.center_1">heir of Mr. Bheeshma?</span>

847
01:03:48,833 --> 01:03:50,666
<span style="style.center_1">If you agree, like our video.</span>

848
01:03:50,791 --> 01:03:52,208
<span style="style.center_1">If you disagree, leave a comment.</span>

849
01:03:52,458 --> 01:03:54,875
<span style="style.center_1">Keep watching</span>
<span style="style.center_1">and subscribe to our channel.</span>

850
01:03:54,958 --> 01:03:56,875
All the features are spot on.

851
01:03:57,041 --> 01:03:59,666
Why are they still divided on it?

852
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,833
You look so similar to your grandpa.

853
01:04:03,250 --> 01:04:05,333
This world doesn't go
by features, Pramila.

854
01:04:07,541 --> 01:04:10,833
I felt a unique vibration within
me the first time I saw him.

855
01:04:12,083 --> 01:04:14,291
Maybe, this is what they
call a blood-relation.

856
01:04:29,541 --> 01:04:31,541
Mom, please don't be upset.

857
01:04:32,291 --> 01:04:33,666
I'll keep visiting you.

858
01:04:34,291 --> 01:04:35,875
Grandpa really needs me right now.

859
01:04:36,458 --> 01:04:37,375
I'm going.

860
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:38,583
Take care of Dad.

861
01:04:39,458 --> 01:04:40,375
Dear...

862
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:46,375
-Tell him.
-You have nothing to do with that man.

863
01:04:54,791 --> 01:04:55,708
Yes.

864
01:04:57,041 --> 01:04:58,500
This is your grandfather.

865
01:05:00,583 --> 01:05:01,958
He passed away when I was little.

866
01:05:04,291 --> 01:05:06,833
Dad, this is no time to joke.

867
01:05:07,791 --> 01:05:09,125
Why would I joke with you?

868
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:13,333
He had you at point blank,
fuming to shoot you.

869
01:05:13,833 --> 01:05:16,750
I was worried he'd do something to you.

870
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,250
So, I made it all up.

871
01:05:22,208 --> 01:05:24,750
That's all fine,
but why did the media show up?

872
01:05:28,416 --> 01:05:29,875
Because I told them to.

873
01:05:31,250 --> 01:05:33,041
As soon as your dad said
you're the heir...

874
01:05:33,208 --> 01:05:36,000
Deva got shocked and moved
the gun towards me.

875
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:38,916
-He's the heir to that company.
-Dear...

876
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,166
<span style="style.center_1">If he gets suspicious that we lied...</span>

877
01:05:41,291 --> 01:05:43,166
<span style="style.center_1">I'll be the first person</span>
<span style="style.center_1">to die in his hands.</span>

878
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:45,250
<span style="style.center_1">I decided to deal with</span>
<span style="style.center_1">the consequences later...</span>

879
01:05:45,333 --> 01:05:47,875
<span style="style.center_1">and texted in my media group</span>
<span style="style.center_1">that you're the next CEO.</span>

880
01:05:52,166 --> 01:05:53,750
You know how the media is.

881
01:05:53,958 --> 01:05:57,041
They came rushing as soon as
they got the breaking news.

882
01:06:00,083 --> 01:06:01,958
You all are kidding me, right?

883
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:05,250
His name is Bheeshma and so is mine.

884
01:06:10,125 --> 01:06:12,500
That is why, I was confident
Deva will believe me.

885
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:57,416
Hey, Pramila! Switch off the phone.

886
01:07:01,291 --> 01:07:02,416
Do it fast!

887
01:07:08,875 --> 01:07:11,250
Dear, don't get excited
and make his cutouts.

888
01:07:11,333 --> 01:07:13,291
I heard he's not the real heir.

889
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,791
I was... calling...

890
01:07:29,625 --> 01:07:30,833
my dear...

891
01:07:33,375 --> 01:07:36,333
You look just like your grandpa.

892
01:07:37,166 --> 01:07:40,000
-You said that we had the same features.
-You said that you felt the vibrations.

893
01:07:41,125 --> 01:07:42,958
To hell with you, Mom and Dad!

894
01:07:43,208 --> 01:07:45,208
The ACP wasn't wrong
in yelling at you, Dad.

895
01:07:45,291 --> 01:07:47,125
You lied to your son!

896
01:07:47,958 --> 01:07:48,833
I am disappointed!

897
01:07:49,958 --> 01:07:53,125
I thought I was a millionaire...

898
01:07:53,208 --> 01:07:55,583
who was living in this
house like a poor guy.

899
01:07:58,458 --> 01:08:02,583
So, this is... my original life.

900
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:04,458
This is the one!

901
01:08:04,541 --> 01:08:05,791
God, I hate my life!

902
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:13,250
Mom, why did you call Dad
in the middle of all that?

903
01:08:14,375 --> 01:08:16,458
Your dad was blabbering continuously.

904
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,583
So, I yelled to stop him.

905
01:08:19,375 --> 01:08:21,208
But he used that as a buildup.

906
01:08:25,958 --> 01:08:29,000
Let's hide for a while before
Deva finds out about the truth.

907
01:08:30,291 --> 01:08:32,958
We're not going anywhere.
I need to tell Chaithra about this.

908
01:08:37,875 --> 01:08:40,541
<span style="style.center_1">Are you out of your mind?</span>
<span style="style.center_1">You can't tell me anything.</span>

909
01:08:40,625 --> 01:08:43,416
<span style="style.center_1">I know everything about my company.</span>

910
01:08:43,583 --> 01:08:45,416
<span style="style.center_1">You're not the company's CEO.</span>

911
01:08:45,708 --> 01:08:48,666
<span style="style.center_1">Look what Dad thinks about you.</span>

912
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:51,375
<span style="style.center_1">If my daughter has chosen someone...</span>

913
01:08:51,458 --> 01:08:54,000
<span style="style.center_1">he's definitely going to meet</span>
<span style="style.center_1">my expectations.</span>

914
01:08:54,541 --> 01:08:58,041
<span style="style.center_1">It doesn't get any better than the fact</span>
<span style="style.center_1">that he's Mr. Bheeshma's grandson.</span>

915
01:09:01,833 --> 01:09:04,291
<span style="style.center_1">As soon as he's announced</span>
<span style="style.center_1">the next CEO of that company...</span>

916
01:09:04,541 --> 01:09:05,958
<span style="style.center_1">we'll get Chaithra married to him.</span>

917
01:09:07,708 --> 01:09:09,083
<span style="style.center_1">If he finds out about the truth now...</span>

918
01:09:09,333 --> 01:09:11,000
<span style="style.center_1">then what do I tell him?</span>

919
01:09:11,541 --> 01:09:13,291
<span style="style.center_1">Don't show me your face ever again!</span>

920
01:09:18,708 --> 01:09:20,708
Everyone has decided
to go to Anantagiri Hills.

921
01:09:21,125 --> 01:09:22,583
Will you be bringing along that bag?

922
01:09:25,583 --> 01:09:26,458
Shut up!

923
01:09:31,625 --> 01:09:32,500
Chaithra...

924
01:09:33,791 --> 01:09:36,250
Chaithra... Chaithra, please. One second.
Listen to me.

925
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:37,500
What do you want to tell me?

926
01:09:37,708 --> 01:09:39,708
That it isn't your fault?

927
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:42,041
You told me you were the ACP.

928
01:09:42,708 --> 01:09:45,333
I knew the truth because
I am the ACP's daughter.

929
01:09:45,791 --> 01:09:47,208
If it were some other girl...

930
01:09:49,416 --> 01:09:52,250
you would've still manipulated her.

931
01:09:52,875 --> 01:09:54,250
Don't you think that's wrong?

932
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:59,041
You wanted to earn my dad's trust...

933
01:09:59,708 --> 01:10:01,375
and convince him for my hand in marriage.

934
01:10:02,083 --> 01:10:05,083
You wanted to convince him at
the cost of cheating him.

935
01:10:05,666 --> 01:10:09,333
Trust and betrayal don't go together.

936
01:10:09,708 --> 01:10:12,625
Chaithra, I didn't cheat you. I loved you.

937
01:10:15,916 --> 01:10:17,583
What should I do to earn your trust?

938
01:10:18,375 --> 01:10:20,750
Should I tell your dad the truth
before he finds out?

939
01:10:20,958 --> 01:10:22,708
Wait. I'll tell him right now.

940
01:10:29,125 --> 01:10:30,333
Sir, where are you?

941
01:10:30,458 --> 01:10:33,083
I heard your company's official CEO
announcement is at four o'clock.

942
01:10:33,166 --> 01:10:34,250
Where will I be?

943
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:40,208
<span style="style.center_1">I'm waiting for your</span>
<span style="style.center_1">grandfather to show up.</span>

944
01:10:41,208 --> 01:10:43,000
By the way, where are you?

945
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:55,833
Sir, I have to talk to you.

946
01:10:56,666 --> 01:10:59,791
-Why aren't you dressed up yet?
-No, sir. Mr. Bheeshma and I--

947
01:10:59,875 --> 01:11:02,583
We'll talk peacefully
after the press meet.

948
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:06,125
-Your grandfather--
-No, sir. Listen to me.

949
01:11:11,041 --> 01:11:13,166
On the eve of our company's anniversary...

950
01:11:14,625 --> 01:11:17,083
I wanted to announce our next CEO.

951
01:11:18,666 --> 01:11:20,500
But the news surfaced meanwhile.

952
01:11:21,208 --> 01:11:25,291
Everyone is wondering if it's true.

953
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:32,958
Nobody knows who's going to be
our company's next CEO...

954
01:11:33,166 --> 01:11:34,458
except for me.

955
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:41,041
I'm puzzled as to how the media knows.

956
01:11:43,125 --> 01:11:46,291
But that news is 100 percent true.

957
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:28,750
You should've worn a suit.

958
01:12:50,833 --> 01:12:52,541
Which college?

959
01:12:55,541 --> 01:12:58,666
A degree dropout will be the CEO
of such a prestigious company?

960
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:01,500
Education is pretty important
to gain knowledge.

961
01:13:02,666 --> 01:13:07,125
But it's a myth that only education
gives you knowledge.

962
01:13:07,875 --> 01:13:11,875
Sir, there are many successors
to you in the company.

963
01:13:16,458 --> 01:13:22,375
But you all don't have
to trust him just because I do.

964
01:13:23,250 --> 01:13:28,250
I'm appointing him as
the operational CEO for 30 days.

965
01:13:28,750 --> 01:13:33,666
If anyone of you says, "Why him?"
on the 31st day...

966
01:13:51,416 --> 01:13:52,291
Yes?

967
01:13:52,416 --> 01:13:55,250
You and I both know
that the news was fake.

968
01:13:55,416 --> 01:13:57,166
Then, why did you announce me as the CEO?

969
01:13:57,625 --> 01:14:00,625
Is it because I spoke at
the auditorium the other day?

970
01:14:01,625 --> 01:14:03,958
I would've offered you a job
if I had liked what you said.

971
01:14:04,291 --> 01:14:06,000
I wouldn't have given
you the CEO position.

972
01:14:06,250 --> 01:14:08,666
You need to prove that you're
the best in the next 30 days.

973
01:14:08,791 --> 01:14:11,625
On the 31st day, I'll tell you
why I made this decision.

974
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,833
I'd often ask my son what
he'd grow up to become.

975
01:14:24,083 --> 01:14:25,458
He'd say he'd grow up to be a man.

976
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:28,125
Now, I get what he meant by that.

977
01:14:28,333 --> 01:14:30,416
He didn't mean physical growth.

978
01:14:30,750 --> 01:14:32,458
He meant he'd grow up
to be a man of honor.

979
01:14:32,958 --> 01:14:33,875
He became the CEO!

980
01:14:35,041 --> 01:14:36,041
Shall we move?

981
01:14:39,041 --> 01:14:41,416
Hey! I've seen you before.

982
01:14:42,375 --> 01:14:43,875
-Forgot me already?
-Hey, Parimal!

983
01:14:43,958 --> 01:14:44,875
What are you doing here?

984
01:14:44,958 --> 01:14:46,791
-He's your driver.
-He's my friend, Dad.

985
01:14:46,875 --> 01:14:49,916
Hey! You can't be friends
with the driver.

986
01:14:50,250 --> 01:14:53,333
He's not friends with the driver. I became
a driver because I was friends with him.

987
01:14:53,416 --> 01:14:55,916
Your son only met me twice
throughout my life.

988
01:14:56,583 --> 01:14:59,166
But he caused so much damage that it
will take me two decades to recover.

989
01:14:59,250 --> 01:15:01,958
Bro, I'm the reason you got fired
the first time. I admit it.

990
01:15:02,041 --> 01:15:03,875
-But what did I do the second time?
-You want to know?

991
01:15:03,958 --> 01:15:07,041
You said, "My friend will continue."
You put it in my hands and left.

992
01:15:07,125 --> 01:15:08,541
-What did he put?
-Mic, Dad.

993
01:15:08,625 --> 01:15:10,125
Oh. What happened next?

994
01:15:10,208 --> 01:15:11,916
-My MD wanted to see me.
-Oh!

995
01:15:12,458 --> 01:15:14,125
I went into his cabin. I was being polite.

996
01:15:17,583 --> 01:15:18,541
Is he your friend?

997
01:15:18,666 --> 01:15:19,500
Hell no, sir!

998
01:15:19,625 --> 01:15:21,208
I was already fired once because of him.

999
01:15:21,291 --> 01:15:22,666
I don't get along with him at all.

1000
01:15:23,291 --> 01:15:27,958
In that case, why didn't you react when
he was humiliating me on the dais?

1001
01:15:28,166 --> 01:15:30,958
You didn't defend yourself.

1002
01:15:31,291 --> 01:15:33,958
So, it was not my place to say anything.
There was no purpose.

1003
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,500
You said you were fired once, right?

1004
01:15:39,791 --> 01:15:40,916
This is your second time.

1005
01:15:44,750 --> 01:15:46,958
My first boss was better.
He just took my job back.

1006
01:15:47,291 --> 01:15:49,083
But this man took my certificates as well.

1007
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:51,583
I'm not worth a penny now.

1008
01:15:51,958 --> 01:15:55,125
A person's worth increases when
he's dead than when he's alive.

1009
01:15:55,458 --> 01:15:56,375
How come?

1010
01:15:56,625 --> 01:15:58,500
When a hen is alive,
it's 90 rupees a kilo.

1011
01:15:58,583 --> 01:16:00,208
But when it's dead,
it's 190 rupees a kilo.

1012
01:16:00,291 --> 01:16:02,250
Did you notice how its death
increased its worth?

1013
01:16:06,916 --> 01:16:08,541
How did he manage to become
the CEO, sir?

1014
01:16:08,791 --> 01:16:09,708
I'll explain.

1015
01:16:10,041 --> 01:16:12,625
I'd often ask my son what
he'd grow up to become.

1016
01:16:12,708 --> 01:16:14,083
But you already said that earlier.

1017
01:16:14,166 --> 01:16:16,000
I don't have the patience
to hear it again.

1018
01:16:19,041 --> 01:16:20,125
-Tell me, Parimal.
-What?

1019
01:16:20,333 --> 01:16:23,416
Why do you think Mr. Bheeshma
announced me as the CEO?

1020
01:16:23,916 --> 01:16:25,708
He has 8,000 crores.

1021
01:16:26,875 --> 01:16:32,250
He must've thought any CEO cannot
possibly bring him down.

1022
01:16:32,541 --> 01:16:33,416
Oh!

1023
01:16:35,416 --> 01:16:37,958
Nothing's a greater comeback
than you becoming the company's CEO.

1024
01:16:38,041 --> 01:16:40,958
Forget CEO, that girl is
more important to me.

1025
01:16:41,333 --> 01:16:44,333
Watch me impress her
again in these 30 days.

1026
01:16:44,416 --> 01:16:46,791
Man! Your desperation is killing me.

1027
01:16:47,375 --> 01:16:49,875
Every time you came into my life,
you grew heights.

1028
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,250
And I dropped to the ground.

1029
01:16:51,416 --> 01:16:53,500
So, this time I decided to come
into your life.

1030
01:16:53,708 --> 01:16:55,708
And I got a driver's job in your company.

1031
01:16:59,083 --> 01:16:59,916
Remember.

1032
01:17:00,416 --> 01:17:03,791
Forget about being the CEO for 30 days.
I'll make you my servant.

1033
01:17:07,166 --> 01:17:08,208
That's a good one, bro.

1034
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:09,166
Tell me what it means.

1035
01:17:10,666 --> 01:17:11,958
If you're lucky, you get a check.

1036
01:17:12,041 --> 01:17:14,000
After that, rest of them are finished.
Am I right?

1037
01:17:14,083 --> 01:17:17,750
Hey! Every time I think you
have some basic sense...

1038
01:17:17,833 --> 01:17:19,375
you keep disappointing me.

1039
01:17:19,875 --> 01:17:20,916
What's wrong, bro?

1040
01:17:21,291 --> 01:17:23,416
-We've reached the office. Get down.
-Already?

1041
01:17:25,208 --> 01:17:28,458
Bheeshma, you're the CEO.
You should look stylish.

1042
01:18:23,166 --> 01:18:24,000
Nice!

1043
01:18:25,125 --> 01:18:27,083
He said I was the CEO, so--

1044
01:18:27,166 --> 01:18:28,458
I'll kill you!

1045
01:18:29,291 --> 01:18:31,208
Did he say it?
Or did you make him say it?

1046
01:18:31,291 --> 01:18:33,375
I swear to God I didn't
influence his decision.

1047
01:18:35,458 --> 01:18:37,000
You're such a manipulator.

1048
01:18:37,791 --> 01:18:38,916
You made me say it.

1049
01:18:40,333 --> 01:18:41,291
What did I make you say?

1050
01:18:42,375 --> 01:18:43,541
-Don't you remember?
-No.

1051
01:18:43,791 --> 01:18:45,083
-You don't remember?
-No.

1052
01:18:46,083 --> 01:18:47,083
You don't remember?

1053
01:18:49,583 --> 01:18:52,208
Oh, my God! This CEO
seems like a big player.

1054
01:18:52,583 --> 01:18:55,625
He's flirting with the most beautiful girl
in the company on his first day.

1055
01:19:00,791 --> 01:19:05,083
I'll save this company from you
just like I saved myself.

1056
01:19:05,833 --> 01:19:10,666
On the 30th day, you'll be out of my life
and out of this company forever.

1057
01:19:13,041 --> 01:19:14,000
Mark my words!

1058
01:19:18,250 --> 01:19:19,791
What's going to happen on the 30th?

1059
01:19:20,041 --> 01:19:22,666
Her hand is on her stomach. Is she...

1060
01:19:24,125 --> 01:19:25,125
Hey, driver!

1061
01:19:25,875 --> 01:19:26,916
-Hey--
-Come here, man.

1062
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:34,208
Take these 50 bucks and...
don't tell anyone, okay?

1063
01:19:34,333 --> 01:19:37,750
Is our new boss interested in women?

1064
01:19:38,458 --> 01:19:40,625
Take these 500 bucks and tell everyone.

1065
01:19:40,833 --> 01:19:41,791
He's not just interested.

1066
01:19:41,875 --> 01:19:43,625
He's crazy about them. He goes insane.

1067
01:19:48,208 --> 01:19:50,708
Sir, why did you make this decision?

1068
01:19:51,708 --> 01:19:52,583
Sit down.

1069
01:19:56,541 --> 01:19:57,666
I trust him, dear.

1070
01:19:58,166 --> 01:20:00,458
Sir, I know everything about him.

1071
01:20:00,791 --> 01:20:02,500
Why would you trust him?

1072
01:20:12,125 --> 01:20:14,250
But some people don't like it, sir.

1073
01:20:14,416 --> 01:20:15,666
Don't give a damn about them.

1074
01:20:15,958 --> 01:20:18,500
Just do what you like to do.

1075
01:20:18,875 --> 01:20:20,666
So, what do I have to do
in the company, sir?

1076
01:20:23,208 --> 01:20:24,500
Show him around the office.

1077
01:20:31,833 --> 01:20:33,041
Will you get changed and come?

1078
01:20:33,250 --> 01:20:34,333
I'll have to go home.

1079
01:20:34,583 --> 01:20:35,500
I'll wait.

1080
01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:40,875
5000 employees are working
in Bheeshma Organics.

1081
01:20:40,958 --> 01:20:42,541
We have 500 working here.

1082
01:20:42,750 --> 01:20:45,041
Rest of them work in
the stores and on filed.

1083
01:20:45,666 --> 01:20:47,000
This is the administrative block.

1084
01:20:47,291 --> 01:20:50,416
All the administration work that concerns
our company is done here.

1085
01:20:52,291 --> 01:20:54,083
Don't Google what administration means.

1086
01:20:54,416 --> 01:20:55,666
It means authorizing something.

1087
01:21:03,208 --> 01:21:04,583
-This is the certification wing.
-Okay.

1088
01:21:04,666 --> 01:21:07,750
This is the team that certifies
the produce chemical-free.

1089
01:21:15,083 --> 01:21:16,083
That's the marketing wing.

1090
01:21:16,166 --> 01:21:18,083
They take care of all the marketing work.

1091
01:21:30,875 --> 01:21:34,416
That's the farm insurance wing. All the
insurance process is carried out there.

1092
01:21:37,458 --> 01:21:38,458
And this company--

1093
01:21:45,291 --> 01:21:47,375
-Really nice!
-Sorry?

1094
01:21:47,583 --> 01:21:48,500
Hey! Hold on.

1095
01:21:51,916 --> 01:21:53,375
The company is really good.

1096
01:21:53,458 --> 01:21:57,041
I've never seen such a beautiful place.

1097
01:21:58,791 --> 01:22:02,333
The fairness, brightness and finishing...

1098
01:22:02,625 --> 01:22:04,916
Wow! Just wow!

1099
01:22:05,125 --> 01:22:07,291
But the center is...

1100
01:22:11,208 --> 01:22:15,125
Sir observed something about you
and the company.

1101
01:22:24,458 --> 01:22:25,916
Yes, enlighten us.

1102
01:22:30,625 --> 01:22:33,000
We should all work hard.

1103
01:22:35,375 --> 01:22:37,958
We should be united like a team.

1104
01:22:39,666 --> 01:22:41,250
-You're not listening to me.
-No, sir.

1105
01:22:41,333 --> 01:22:42,416
That's what I'm saying.
You're not listening to me.

1106
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:43,500
No, sir. I'm listening.

1107
01:22:43,583 --> 01:22:46,791
If you were, your ears would be directed
toward me, but they're clearly not.

1108
01:22:46,916 --> 01:22:48,208
I'm upset with you.

1109
01:22:49,916 --> 01:22:51,333
Everyone's ears are like this.

1110
01:22:51,458 --> 01:22:53,375
I'm not some alien to have weird ears.

1111
01:22:56,166 --> 01:22:57,041
Sure!

1112
01:23:03,333 --> 01:23:04,833
I didn't know that was a word.

1113
01:23:05,791 --> 01:23:07,125
Which language is he speaking?

1114
01:23:08,041 --> 01:23:09,208
Forget about 30 days.

1115
01:23:09,541 --> 01:23:12,500
If he lasts for three more days,
our company will be shut down.

1116
01:23:13,708 --> 01:23:14,625
He needs to leave.

1117
01:23:14,875 --> 01:23:16,083
Immediately!

1118
01:23:16,666 --> 01:23:20,041
Schedule a meeting with the team leaders
and call it "Interaction with the CEO."

1119
01:23:20,375 --> 01:23:23,208
His language and body language
will surely give him away.

1120
01:23:23,708 --> 01:23:24,708
That's a good idea.

1121
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:26,416
But you are a driver.

1122
01:23:26,625 --> 01:23:28,291
He was also a driver, sir.
Didn't he become the CEO?

1123
01:23:28,875 --> 01:23:30,791
Lose your ego and work
on getting rid of him.

1124
01:23:31,250 --> 01:23:32,500
Otherwise, your ears will bleed

1125
01:23:32,583 --> 01:23:35,458
from hearing words like "Putted,"
"Sitted" and "Cutted."

1126
01:23:37,416 --> 01:23:38,333
He's right.

1127
01:23:41,791 --> 01:23:43,875
Until now, only I knew what
kind of a person you are.

1128
01:23:44,708 --> 01:23:47,041
But after this meeting,
the whole company will know.

1129
01:23:50,291 --> 01:23:52,250
Though sir is the CEO
for a temporary period...

1130
01:23:53,041 --> 01:23:55,333
you all need to get to know him better.

1131
01:23:56,041 --> 01:23:58,125
That is why, we've arranged
this interaction program.

1132
01:24:13,708 --> 01:24:15,041
Is he going to sing a song now?

1133
01:24:15,125 --> 01:24:17,083
Sir, you're a Virgo, right?

1134
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,416
-How do you know?
-I'm also a Virgo.

1135
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:20,750
That's why, we think so similarly.

1136
01:24:20,833 --> 01:24:22,958
You have a big mole
on your thigh, right?

1137
01:24:23,291 --> 01:24:24,791
-Do you want me to strip now?
-No, sir!

1138
01:24:24,875 --> 01:24:25,750
Focus there.

1139
01:24:26,833 --> 01:24:28,708
Can you all stand up for me, please?

1140
01:24:33,625 --> 01:24:35,583
There are balloons under your pads.
Take them.

1141
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:41,833
Now, blow them.

1142
01:24:42,291 --> 01:24:43,166
-Blow them?
-Blow them?

1143
01:24:44,166 --> 01:24:46,000
You can do it, right?
Come on, blow them.

1144
01:24:55,125 --> 01:24:56,500
Grab those pins beside you.

1145
01:24:58,625 --> 01:24:59,916
You have 30 seconds.

1146
01:25:00,416 --> 01:25:03,625
Whoever will still have the balloon
at the end will be the winner.

1147
01:25:05,250 --> 01:25:07,416
The winner gets two months' salary bonus.

1148
01:25:09,375 --> 01:25:11,041
-Sir, give me a balloon.
-Hold on.

1149
01:25:16,708 --> 01:25:18,500
-Hey! Come here.
-Come here.

1150
01:25:26,583 --> 01:25:27,875
Hey! Come here.

1151
01:25:28,166 --> 01:25:29,083
Catch him.

1152
01:25:34,750 --> 01:25:36,166
What is he trying to do?

1153
01:25:36,666 --> 01:25:38,916
I'm the victim, sir. Not the witness.

1154
01:25:41,083 --> 01:25:43,041
So, none of you have a balloon.

1155
01:25:44,833 --> 01:25:47,416
I had said whoever will still have the
balloon at the end will be the winner.

1156
01:25:47,541 --> 01:25:50,458
If all of you had your balloons,
you'd all be the winners, right?

1157
01:25:54,833 --> 01:25:56,708
Each one of you wants to be the winner.

1158
01:25:57,375 --> 01:25:59,208
You don't mind defeating
the others for it.

1159
01:25:59,875 --> 01:26:02,375
Honestly, a single player's victory
can't make the team win.

1160
01:26:02,666 --> 01:26:04,833
And a company doesn't triumph
because of that either.

1161
01:26:05,083 --> 01:26:05,916
But...

1162
01:26:06,916 --> 01:26:09,458
if a team wins, it means every
player of that team is a winner.

1163
01:26:11,333 --> 01:26:13,916
If a company triumphs, it means its
every employee has succeeded.

1164
01:26:16,333 --> 01:26:17,833
We're just a stone if we're alone.

1165
01:26:18,625 --> 01:26:19,958
But together, we are a mountain.

1166
01:26:20,875 --> 01:26:22,166
Oh, not bad!

1167
01:26:22,625 --> 01:26:23,708
He means a mountain.

1168
01:26:23,791 --> 01:26:25,375
We're just a plant if we're alone.

1169
01:26:25,958 --> 01:26:27,333
But together, we're a garden.

1170
01:26:28,458 --> 01:26:29,958
We're just employees if we're alone.

1171
01:26:30,416 --> 01:26:32,000
But together, we're a company.

1172
01:26:32,666 --> 01:26:33,541
Now, tell me.

1173
01:26:33,833 --> 01:26:35,750
You or the company?

1174
01:26:36,958 --> 01:26:38,708
Say it out loud!
You or the company?

1175
01:26:41,833 --> 01:26:43,666
Is he giving a speech or
casting a spell on them?

1176
01:26:46,875 --> 01:26:48,166
One last thing.

1177
01:26:48,333 --> 01:26:49,166
Oh, no!

1178
01:26:49,958 --> 01:26:51,250
He who reads a book is a reader.

1179
01:26:52,750 --> 01:26:54,083
He who defends a case is a pleader.

1180
01:26:54,875 --> 01:26:56,875
He who guides a team is a leader.

1181
01:26:58,041 --> 01:27:00,500
That which holds files is a folder
and holds cups is a holder.

1182
01:27:00,583 --> 01:27:03,250
-These are all WhatsApp forwards.
-That is why, I don't use WhatsApp.

1183
01:27:03,333 --> 01:27:05,375
Who cares? Mind your business!

1184
01:27:12,333 --> 01:27:14,083
We worked for our salaries until now.

1185
01:27:14,791 --> 01:27:17,041
But we'll put our heart and soul
into this company now.

1186
01:27:17,833 --> 01:27:19,541
You're great, sir.
You're just great.

1187
01:27:19,916 --> 01:27:21,916
I misunderstood you
up until this point, sir.

1188
01:27:22,166 --> 01:27:24,625
But I'll not let anyone
demean you anymore.

1189
01:27:25,916 --> 01:27:27,416
Mr. Bheeshma's decision is correct.

1190
01:27:28,416 --> 01:27:29,833
Let's get back to work.

1191
01:27:33,916 --> 01:27:35,666
We choose our company, sir. Company!

1192
01:27:40,166 --> 01:27:41,083
Hold on.

1193
01:27:41,375 --> 01:27:42,333
Tell me the truth.

1194
01:27:42,458 --> 01:27:44,083
-You're also on his side, right?
-Sir!

1195
01:27:44,875 --> 01:27:46,916
You don't know the kind
of life I had before.

1196
01:27:48,875 --> 01:27:50,333
You're also a Virgo, right?

1197
01:27:50,750 --> 01:27:53,333
You have a big mole on your thigh.
I know. I'm sure.

1198
01:27:54,416 --> 01:27:56,541
Why does he keep bringing up my thigh?

1199
01:27:59,333 --> 01:28:02,291
It's a success because you
wished me all the best.

1200
01:28:03,833 --> 01:28:06,666
You're a bigger player than
I ever imagined.

1201
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:08,666
Go away!

1202
01:28:13,541 --> 01:28:14,833
What did you tell me?

1203
01:28:15,958 --> 01:28:18,625
We also expected him
to make one of us the CEO.

1204
01:28:19,625 --> 01:28:22,083
But we don't get when this guy
came into the picture.

1205
01:28:22,750 --> 01:28:26,750
We should invade a Kingdom
while the King is still inexperienced.

1206
01:28:26,833 --> 01:28:27,791
This is the right time.

1207
01:28:29,208 --> 01:28:33,833
Find me an organic village immediately
to plant the first batch of crop.

1208
01:28:46,333 --> 01:28:48,666
-Ma'am, courier from the company.
-Yeah.

1209
01:28:54,583 --> 01:28:56,875
Why did the increment from
Singannapalem come back?

1210
01:28:56,958 --> 01:28:59,083
Procurement team just told me
that they're yet to receive the yield

1211
01:28:59,166 --> 01:29:00,958
that was supposed
to arrive last week.

1212
01:29:01,083 --> 01:29:01,958
What went wrong?

1213
01:29:02,041 --> 01:29:04,375
The executive there isn't
responding either.

1214
01:29:12,791 --> 01:29:15,666
<span style="style.center_1">The number you've called is switched off.</span>

1215
01:29:17,916 --> 01:29:19,041
What do we do now, sir?

1216
01:29:19,583 --> 01:29:22,583
Sir, you don't have
to stress over one village.

1217
01:29:22,958 --> 01:29:24,375
If not that village--

1218
01:29:24,458 --> 01:29:26,916
Balram, don't just write it off.

1219
01:29:27,833 --> 01:29:29,666
Every acre is valuable.

1220
01:29:30,208 --> 01:29:31,416
Did you call Ramaraju?

1221
01:29:31,583 --> 01:29:33,125
His phone is switched off, sir.

1222
01:29:34,791 --> 01:29:36,166
Something must have gone wrong.

1223
01:29:37,333 --> 01:29:38,458
Go and meet him personally.

1224
01:29:40,791 --> 01:29:42,166
Take Bheeshma along with you.

1225
01:29:56,083 --> 01:29:57,625
Why do you look so annoyed, bro?

1226
01:29:57,875 --> 01:30:00,875
This is how you look when
your life is screwed up.

1227
01:30:01,416 --> 01:30:04,583
Anyway, this is not my dream job
to have a good attitude about it.

1228
01:30:05,333 --> 01:30:06,500
What's an axil, bro?

1229
01:30:06,666 --> 01:30:07,500
Forget it.

1230
01:30:07,583 --> 01:30:09,500
-Tell me, bro.
-My armpits, man. My armpits.

1231
01:30:10,625 --> 01:30:12,916
-You seem frustrated. I'm hurt.
-I don't care.

1232
01:30:15,791 --> 01:30:17,750
-Hey! Reduce the volume.
-It's not me, man.

1233
01:30:17,958 --> 01:30:18,833
What?

1234
01:30:19,083 --> 01:30:20,125
It's not me, sir.

1235
01:30:21,291 --> 01:30:22,458
I have a problem, sir.

1236
01:30:22,583 --> 01:30:25,416
I can't resist increasing the volume
when I'm in the front seat.

1237
01:30:26,333 --> 01:30:27,250
Like this.

1238
01:30:38,708 --> 01:30:42,541
Did you notice how smartly
I sent him to the backseat?

1239
01:30:45,250 --> 01:30:47,958
-What are you looking for?
-I had a water spray here.

1240
01:30:48,416 --> 01:30:49,583
-This one?
-Yes.

1241
01:30:52,708 --> 01:30:55,083
-What are you doing?
-You're wearing a floral shirt, right?

1242
01:30:55,166 --> 01:30:57,000
I'm trying to keep
the flowers from withering.

1243
01:30:57,208 --> 01:30:58,958
-Sarcasm, I see!
-Come on, sir.

1244
01:30:59,125 --> 01:31:01,416
You still can't possibly think
you're the smarter one.

1245
01:31:01,583 --> 01:31:03,208
He used you to get what he wanted.

1246
01:31:03,541 --> 01:31:04,541
What did he want?

1247
01:31:04,791 --> 01:31:05,791
Look behind.

1248
01:31:10,791 --> 01:31:12,500
Why is he looking at her like that?

1249
01:31:20,708 --> 01:31:21,583
What?

1250
01:31:21,666 --> 01:31:24,958
I was thinking we could
discuss the village issues.

1251
01:31:25,291 --> 01:31:26,833
Don't try to discuss anything.

1252
01:31:27,333 --> 01:31:28,541
Or disturb me.

1253
01:31:28,625 --> 01:31:29,458
Got it?

1254
01:31:32,750 --> 01:31:33,833
She's a gem, man.

1255
01:31:47,583 --> 01:31:48,458
What?

1256
01:31:52,333 --> 01:31:53,416
I didn't kiss you, sir.

1257
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:55,833
Forget it.

1258
01:31:57,250 --> 01:31:58,750
-I swear...
-I said forget it!

1259
01:32:00,833 --> 01:32:01,708
Just drive.

1260
01:32:21,541 --> 01:32:22,750
What's your problem?

1261
01:32:23,291 --> 01:32:24,291
Nothing.

1262
01:32:26,958 --> 01:32:28,083
She's a gem, man.

1263
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:30,083
-That is why he's licking her.
-What?

1264
01:32:30,416 --> 01:32:31,333
Gems!

1265
01:32:33,208 --> 01:32:34,666
No more tunnels, right?

1266
01:32:34,875 --> 01:32:36,541
There's one last tunnel, sir.

1267
01:32:42,541 --> 01:32:44,083
We haven't reached the tunnel yet.

1268
01:32:45,875 --> 01:32:47,000
Now, we have.

1269
01:32:58,416 --> 01:33:00,333
His fingers will be sore.
Ask him to stop, sir.

1270
01:33:21,833 --> 01:33:24,291
Don't give me that cute look.
I feel shy.

1271
01:33:25,250 --> 01:33:26,333
Cute? What the hell!

1272
01:33:46,416 --> 01:33:49,166
<span style="style.center_1">Your smile is super cute</span>

1273
01:33:49,291 --> 01:33:51,708
<span style="style.center_1">Your white stole is super cute</span>

1274
01:33:51,791 --> 01:33:55,666
<span style="style.center_1">You've made my heart race with a glance</span>

1275
01:33:56,708 --> 01:33:59,208
<span style="style.center_1">Your walk is super cute</span>

1276
01:33:59,291 --> 01:34:01,833
<span style="style.center_1">Your outlook is super cute</span>

1277
01:34:01,916 --> 01:34:05,958
<span style="style.center_1">You're better than</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Miss World in my eyes</span>

1278
01:34:06,125 --> 01:34:08,583
<span style="style.center_1">Your elegance can cause a catastrophe</span>

1279
01:34:08,666 --> 01:34:11,166
<span style="style.center_1">My heart will explode if you surround me</span>

1280
01:34:11,250 --> 01:34:16,125
<span style="style.center_1">Keep me hooked with a gaze and I'm yours</span>

1281
01:34:16,208 --> 01:34:21,333
<span style="style.center_1">Say yes and here begins</span>
<span style="style.center_1">The journey of our love</span>

1282
01:34:21,416 --> 01:34:25,458
<span style="style.center_1">How can you look so pretty</span>
<span style="style.center_1">When you're mad at me?</span>

1283
01:34:25,541 --> 01:34:27,708
<span style="style.center_1">Why don't you listen to me?</span>

1284
01:34:35,625 --> 01:34:37,875
<span style="style.center_1">Our couple is super cute</span>

1285
01:35:22,166 --> 01:35:24,625
<span style="style.center_1">No matter what I do for you</span>

1286
01:35:24,875 --> 01:35:27,250
<span style="style.center_1">Even if I sacrifice my life</span>

1287
01:35:27,416 --> 01:35:31,791
<span style="style.center_1">Why don't you show some mercy?</span>

1288
01:35:32,291 --> 01:35:34,750
<span style="style.center_1">You can search all over the world</span>

1289
01:35:34,958 --> 01:35:37,250
<span style="style.center_1">You can wander all over the universe</span>

1290
01:35:37,458 --> 01:35:42,000
<span style="style.center_1">But you can't find a guy like me, darling</span>

1291
01:35:43,291 --> 01:35:47,500
<span style="style.center_1">This feeling of being</span>
<span style="style.center_1">With you is super cute</span>

1292
01:35:48,291 --> 01:35:53,083
<span style="style.center_1">Stop playing around with me</span>

1293
01:35:53,458 --> 01:35:57,833
<span style="style.center_1">Don't torture me, you naughty beauty</span>

1294
01:35:58,375 --> 01:36:01,291
<span style="style.center_1">Our future lies in your hands</span>

1295
01:36:01,416 --> 01:36:03,916
<span style="style.center_1">Why don't you listen to me?</span>

1296
01:36:11,458 --> 01:36:14,041
<span style="style.center_1">Our couple is super cute</span>

1297
01:36:58,416 --> 01:36:59,416
Sir...

1298
01:36:59,625 --> 01:37:01,375
May I meet Mr. Raju once?

1299
01:37:01,500 --> 01:37:03,750
Ramulu, I've already told you.

1300
01:37:04,166 --> 01:37:05,541
He's not feeling his best.

1301
01:37:06,375 --> 01:37:08,833
No, sir. Just once.

1302
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:10,916
Don't bother me. Please, leave.

1303
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:34,458
Ma'am... what are you doing here?

1304
01:37:34,666 --> 01:37:36,083
I'm here to meet Mr. Ramaraju.

1305
01:37:36,208 --> 01:37:37,625
He's inside. Please, come.

1306
01:37:37,791 --> 01:37:38,625
Tell me, dear.

1307
01:37:38,708 --> 01:37:42,916
Sir, villagers of Singannapalem canceled
their agreement with our company.

1308
01:37:43,125 --> 01:37:45,041
I was hoping to find out what went wrong.

1309
01:37:45,125 --> 01:37:47,250
There's no point in knowing now, dear.

1310
01:37:48,333 --> 01:37:51,041
They're signing an agreement
with Field Science.

1311
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:52,875
With the Field Science company?

1312
01:37:53,333 --> 01:37:54,416
How come, sir?

1313
01:37:57,041 --> 01:37:59,083
<span style="style.center_1">Farmers had a really</span>
<span style="style.center_1">good yield this season.</span>

1314
01:37:59,625 --> 01:38:03,958
<span style="style.center_1">All the produce was transported in</span>
<span style="style.center_1">the Bheeshma Organics trucks like always.</span>

1315
01:38:04,250 --> 01:38:07,666
<span style="style.center_1">While the farmers were waiting</span>
<span style="style.center_1">for the money on their harvest...</span>

1316
01:38:08,083 --> 01:38:11,916
<span style="style.center_1">their produce was sent back</span>
<span style="style.center_1">to them in a week.</span>

1317
01:38:12,625 --> 01:38:16,500
<span style="style.center_1">They were told their yield was</span>
<span style="style.center_1">packed with chemicals.</span>

1318
01:38:16,750 --> 01:38:21,041
<span style="style.center_1">They tried to convince them that</span>
<span style="style.center_1">they wouldn't do such a thing.</span>

1319
01:38:21,541 --> 01:38:23,791
But their produce was rejected anyway.

1320
01:38:25,958 --> 01:38:28,500
The produce was returned after a week.

1321
01:38:28,833 --> 01:38:30,666
So, all the vegetables were rotten.

1322
01:38:30,958 --> 01:38:35,041
Farmers got furious and decided to have
nothing to do with your company.

1323
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:39,583
That's when... the Village Head took
advantage of the situation.

1324
01:38:39,666 --> 01:38:45,000
We can't just grow crop and hope
they buy it this time.

1325
01:38:45,583 --> 01:38:50,208
I'll get a two days agreement with
Field Science to help you out.

1326
01:38:50,958 --> 01:38:54,250
I'll make sure they pay you
higher than Bheeshma Organics.

1327
01:38:54,458 --> 01:38:56,458
Purushotham! What's going on?

1328
01:38:56,708 --> 01:38:58,916
It was a one-time mistake.

1329
01:38:59,166 --> 01:39:04,083
Don't take advantage of it
and risk losing your fields.

1330
01:39:06,583 --> 01:39:09,500
I'll talk to Mr. Bheeshma on your behalf.

1331
01:39:09,583 --> 01:39:12,291
Take my word for it.
I'll talk to him right now.

1332
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:14,250
Mr. Raju...

1333
01:39:14,875 --> 01:39:18,416
You can't simply say
it's a one-time mistake.

1334
01:39:19,708 --> 01:39:21,833
I can choose to ignore it.

1335
01:39:22,375 --> 01:39:24,375
But what about the raging farmers?

1336
01:39:32,291 --> 01:39:34,500
Field Science and the Village Head...

1337
01:39:35,166 --> 01:39:39,250
have tricked the farmers
to get hold of their fields.

1338
01:39:40,958 --> 01:39:45,041
As far as I know, farmers will
be signing the documents today.

1339
01:39:46,833 --> 01:39:50,833
I know Mr. Bheeshma will
be quick to react on this.

1340
01:39:51,166 --> 01:39:52,750
That is why, I didn't call him.

1341
01:39:55,625 --> 01:39:57,041
Let's go to that village, sir.

1342
01:39:57,875 --> 01:39:59,625
Will you please wait outside?

1343
01:39:59,916 --> 01:40:01,541
Chaithra, please listen to me.

1344
01:40:08,875 --> 01:40:09,916
What do we do now, sir?

1345
01:40:10,083 --> 01:40:10,958
Guys...

1346
01:40:11,583 --> 01:40:13,375
Don't sign the papers.

1347
01:40:13,875 --> 01:40:15,958
Please, listen to me.

1348
01:40:22,375 --> 01:40:24,458
Grandpa, why are you crying?

1349
01:40:25,916 --> 01:40:29,166
Our lives are going to be shattered
in some time.

1350
01:40:29,625 --> 01:40:32,083
I can't help but shed tears.

1351
01:40:32,458 --> 01:40:33,750
My son died of suffocation...

1352
01:40:34,083 --> 01:40:37,666
while spraying pesticides in the farm...

1353
01:40:38,083 --> 01:40:40,375
seven years ago.

1354
01:40:40,875 --> 01:40:43,875
I pray to God that no farmer
ever dies like my son.

1355
01:40:44,375 --> 01:40:47,083
I'm hoping our fields don't turn barren.

1356
01:40:47,583 --> 01:40:52,791
Organic farming was introduced
for the first time in our village.

1357
01:40:53,416 --> 01:40:55,750
The villagers' mindsets were changed.

1358
01:40:56,416 --> 01:41:00,500
The pesticides were completely
taken out of the picture.

1359
01:41:02,083 --> 01:41:06,333
After many years, a catastrophe is going
to strike our village.

1360
01:41:09,125 --> 01:41:10,625
Take me to your village, Grandpa.

1361
01:41:19,541 --> 01:41:22,750
Sir, our new CEO is going
to Singanapalem along with Ramulu.

1362
01:41:23,291 --> 01:41:24,166
Oh, no!

1363
01:41:24,666 --> 01:41:25,916
Why is he going alone?

1364
01:41:26,500 --> 01:41:28,291
You know the village head is a scoundrel.

1365
01:41:32,583 --> 01:41:34,333
Our farmers are trustworthy, sir.

1366
01:41:34,750 --> 01:41:36,833
There will be no mishap.
Just go ahead and approve it.

1367
01:41:49,958 --> 01:41:51,000
Put your fingerprint here.

1368
01:42:05,875 --> 01:42:07,000
Who is he?

1369
01:42:07,291 --> 01:42:08,791
The new CEO of Bheeshma Organics.

1370
01:42:11,916 --> 01:42:13,666
He came this far on a scooter?

1371
01:42:31,708 --> 01:42:33,750
Bheeshma Organics has offered you
a better livelihood over all these years.

1372
01:42:33,833 --> 01:42:35,583
How did it fail you this time?

1373
01:42:48,541 --> 01:42:53,083
You all know Mr. Bheeshma
better than anyone else.

1374
01:42:56,500 --> 01:42:59,541
I was asked to compensate every farmer
who incurred loss because of us.

1375
01:43:00,208 --> 01:43:02,916
-Please, don't make--
-Hey, boy!

1376
01:43:03,666 --> 01:43:06,708
You shouldn't find a match for a girl
who's already married.

1377
01:43:07,041 --> 01:43:08,000
It's wrong.

1378
01:43:08,916 --> 01:43:12,041
They've signed
the field science agreements.

1379
01:43:15,583 --> 01:43:16,583
He's the last one to go.

1380
01:43:23,708 --> 01:43:27,708
All these fields belong to them
for the next ten years.

1381
01:43:31,208 --> 01:43:32,333
It's over, dear.

1382
01:43:33,791 --> 01:43:34,833
It's over.

1383
01:43:46,916 --> 01:43:50,375
Alright. They signed your papers
because of the bad history with us.

1384
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,250
They'll cancel the agreement
if they're not happy with your company.

1385
01:43:53,666 --> 01:43:55,500
What?

1386
01:43:56,708 --> 01:43:58,791
He took his glares off.
It's going to get really bad.

1387
01:43:59,000 --> 01:43:59,833
For us?

1388
01:43:59,916 --> 01:44:01,000
No. For him.

1389
01:44:01,750 --> 01:44:05,000
Unlike you, we're not fools to have
a no-clause agreement with the farmers.

1390
01:44:05,541 --> 01:44:08,000
The agreement was properly
drafted by ten lawyers.

1391
01:44:09,291 --> 01:44:11,666
-There's nothing you can do about it.
-We'll go to the court, sir.

1392
01:44:11,916 --> 01:44:12,916
Oh, really?

1393
01:44:13,458 --> 01:44:15,416
Once you've signed these clauses...

1394
01:44:15,541 --> 01:44:18,000
law and order can't get you
your fields back either.

1395
01:44:21,291 --> 01:44:23,583
-This is unfair, sir.
-How is it unfair?

1396
01:44:24,083 --> 01:44:25,875
You know what's unfair?

1397
01:44:26,458 --> 01:44:28,208
Our men have circled the area. Go on.

1398
01:44:32,083 --> 01:44:34,500
The produce they had sent never
got to Bheeshma Organics.

1399
01:44:37,166 --> 01:44:40,125
We bribed your executive,
hacked the truck...

1400
01:44:40,375 --> 01:44:43,375
took the produce to our storage...
and sent it back to them after a week.

1401
01:44:45,625 --> 01:44:47,541
You thought that you never
received the produce.

1402
01:44:47,916 --> 01:44:49,791
But the farmers thought
that you returned it.

1403
01:44:51,875 --> 01:44:53,291
It was a perfect plan.

1404
01:44:55,375 --> 01:44:56,333
This is so unfair!

1405
01:44:57,375 --> 01:44:59,000
Get them, guys! Charge!

1406
01:45:05,750 --> 01:45:06,666
Pack up, guys.

1407
01:45:07,083 --> 01:45:08,416
Sir has to travel really far.

1408
01:45:08,500 --> 01:45:10,125
None of you will leave!

1409
01:45:14,166 --> 01:45:20,125
Don't worry that you've
signed the documents.

1410
01:45:20,625 --> 01:45:26,625
Because none of them will step out
of here with your agreements.

1411
01:45:31,958 --> 01:45:32,791
You...

1412
01:45:46,541 --> 01:45:48,875
Guys! Bury him in these fields.

1413
01:47:25,791 --> 01:47:27,000
Why did you cover your ears?

1414
01:47:27,791 --> 01:47:29,083
I can watch him beat someone up.

1415
01:47:29,500 --> 01:47:31,166
But I can't listen to his quotations, sir.

1416
01:47:31,250 --> 01:47:32,291
What do you mean?

1417
01:47:32,416 --> 01:47:33,416
Look over there.

1418
01:47:37,250 --> 01:47:40,416
"A farmer grows crop,
while a rogue tries to rob."

1419
01:47:43,250 --> 01:47:44,833
"What flies in the sky is a kite...

1420
01:47:45,541 --> 01:47:47,625
whatever I do to you is right."

1421
01:47:51,500 --> 01:47:53,666
-Peaceful, right?
-Peaceful, right?

1422
01:48:15,291 --> 01:48:16,583
He is a hero in the office.

1423
01:48:17,166 --> 01:48:18,750
He is a hero in the village.

1424
01:48:19,875 --> 01:48:21,625
How do we stop him, man?

1425
01:48:22,833 --> 01:48:27,166
Do you realize you're
asking the wrong person?

1426
01:48:27,541 --> 01:48:30,583
If I were capable, why
would I end up as a driver?

1427
01:48:30,666 --> 01:48:31,625
You're right.

1428
01:48:34,958 --> 01:48:37,833
Take good care of Mr. Bheeshma
and the company.

1429
01:48:38,208 --> 01:48:39,250
I will, sir.

1430
01:49:21,166 --> 01:49:24,083
He's really getting on my nerves.

1431
01:49:25,791 --> 01:49:27,041
I must meet him once.

1432
01:49:28,833 --> 01:49:29,875
Shall I call him?

1433
01:49:33,708 --> 01:49:35,875
He will come looking for me.

1434
01:49:37,958 --> 01:49:39,958
I can't believe you're
leading such a simple life...

1435
01:49:40,041 --> 01:49:41,416
despite being a multi-millionaire.

1436
01:49:42,708 --> 01:49:45,083
This is how I love to be, Bheeshma.

1437
01:49:45,500 --> 01:49:48,166
By the way, I was told that
you're an avid reader.

1438
01:49:48,958 --> 01:49:51,208
Read this book. It's really good.

1439
01:49:51,916 --> 01:49:52,750
Never mind, sir.

1440
01:49:52,833 --> 01:49:55,625
The real world is not a good place
as depicted in the books.

1441
01:49:56,416 --> 01:49:58,916
-Then, let's change it.
-Come on, sir. It's way beyond me.

1442
01:50:02,791 --> 01:50:05,750
You changed the people
of a whole village all by yourself.

1443
01:50:06,333 --> 01:50:08,625
You don't have to be someone great.

1444
01:50:08,958 --> 01:50:10,250
All you need is motivation.

1445
01:50:11,083 --> 01:50:12,333
What's your motivation, sir...

1446
01:50:12,625 --> 01:50:15,333
behind taking up organic farming...
behind living alone?

1447
01:50:16,291 --> 01:50:17,166
Love.

1448
01:50:17,708 --> 01:50:20,666
My love for my profession and Nature.

1449
01:50:20,916 --> 01:50:23,666
I'm an agricultural scientist.

1450
01:50:24,875 --> 01:50:27,916
I believe mankind will prosper
as long as Mother Nature does.

1451
01:50:28,333 --> 01:50:33,125
This land gives back whatever you offer.
Good or bad.

1452
01:50:34,166 --> 01:50:38,625
So, I've taken an oath to protect
the nature to my ability.

1453
01:50:40,625 --> 01:50:43,250
Now, about being lonely...

1454
01:50:44,833 --> 01:50:50,458
I lost the girl I loved before
I could tell her how I feel.

1455
01:50:50,625 --> 01:50:53,333
Sir, I'm telling you it's the name.

1456
01:50:54,333 --> 01:50:56,208
Come on, man. No.

1457
01:51:15,083 --> 01:51:16,875
My love life is just like a butterfly.

1458
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,166
You can see it, but you can
never quite get hold of it.

1459
01:51:20,166 --> 01:51:22,333
-Why are you crying?
-It's not me, sir.

1460
01:51:27,333 --> 01:51:28,500
What happened, love?

1461
01:51:29,125 --> 01:51:30,166
Why are you crying?

1462
01:51:30,625 --> 01:51:31,666
Where are your parents?

1463
01:51:35,833 --> 01:51:37,166
Okay. Give me your bag.

1464
01:52:09,583 --> 01:52:10,541
Dad!

1465
01:52:14,208 --> 01:52:15,166
My dear.

1466
01:52:32,458 --> 01:52:34,333
I thought of calling you.

1467
01:52:35,375 --> 01:52:38,083
But if you had refused to come,
my ego couldn't have taken it.

1468
01:52:38,583 --> 01:52:40,375
That is why, I had to do it this way.

1469
01:52:46,791 --> 01:52:48,750
Rather than treating you like an enemy...

1470
01:52:49,458 --> 01:52:52,333
I thought it'd be better
to offer you a deal.

1471
01:52:53,083 --> 01:52:56,166
You won't be voted the CEO
on the 30th day anyway.

1472
01:52:56,916 --> 01:52:58,916
But I will make you the CEO.

1473
01:52:59,416 --> 01:53:00,708
Be my acquaintance.

1474
01:53:01,208 --> 01:53:02,458
We could share the villages.

1475
01:53:03,083 --> 01:53:04,666
I'm not doing anything wrong, you know.

1476
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,083
I'm launching an extraordinary product.

1477
01:53:07,916 --> 01:53:08,958
Think about it.

1478
01:53:10,041 --> 01:53:13,375
If the yield is produced
in fewer months...

1479
01:53:14,458 --> 01:53:16,625
think about how much it's
going to help the farmers...

1480
01:53:16,750 --> 01:53:18,333
how much it's going to help me.

1481
01:53:18,666 --> 01:53:21,250
And how much it's going to help you.

1482
01:53:21,750 --> 01:53:22,666
Think about it.

1483
01:53:25,666 --> 01:53:26,875
In which month were you born?

1484
01:53:30,208 --> 01:53:32,916
Do you know what happens
if you're born in the 6th month?

1485
01:53:35,291 --> 01:53:37,791
You sinful dog!

1486
01:53:57,458 --> 01:53:59,708
I've smacked a lot of your men.

1487
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:02,750
Hey! Didn't you tell him?

1488
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,416
Farming is nothing like cricket.

1489
01:54:10,750 --> 01:54:14,541
You can't filter it down
to One Days and T20s.

1490
01:54:15,208 --> 01:54:16,291
If you compromise on farming...

1491
01:54:16,375 --> 01:54:20,166
man's lifespan will also
come down drastically.

1492
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,875
Whether I'm the CEO or not
after 30 days...

1493
01:54:25,416 --> 01:54:27,041
village is a long shot.

1494
01:54:28,666 --> 01:54:30,666
I'll make sure you don't
get a single acre.

1495
01:54:44,708 --> 01:54:48,791
Hey! I tricked you into coming here.

1496
01:54:49,541 --> 01:54:52,500
Don't you think I can get hold
of your company?

1497
01:54:52,666 --> 01:54:54,333
Oh, really?

1498
01:54:56,458 --> 01:54:57,708
You didn't trick me into coming here.

1499
01:54:57,791 --> 01:55:01,291
I tricked you into
thinking you want me here.

1500
01:55:02,250 --> 01:55:03,333
Don't you get it yet?

1501
01:55:03,458 --> 01:55:06,041
I got that pamphlet
placed in your paper.

1502
01:55:11,208 --> 01:55:13,625
I sent you that text.

1503
01:55:17,750 --> 01:55:20,125
I got that banner tied in front
of your house.

1504
01:55:20,250 --> 01:55:24,541
And finally, I disturbed you enough
to make you want to meet me.

1505
01:55:27,625 --> 01:55:29,833
Hey! You must be thinking you
planned the whole thing.

1506
01:55:29,916 --> 01:55:33,458
But the truth is, I just
blew your mind with my plan.

1507
01:55:45,750 --> 01:55:48,291
Stop overthinking
and enjoy our brand's tea.

1508
01:55:51,125 --> 01:55:52,833
Your brain will become sharp.

1509
01:56:00,875 --> 01:56:01,791
Bye, dear.

1510
01:56:12,416 --> 01:56:17,500
Chaithra, we need to meet with a few
farmers, visit their villages...

1511
01:56:20,083 --> 01:56:22,375
What? I'm really working.

1512
01:56:26,583 --> 01:56:27,791
But I'm unable to work.

1513
01:56:28,791 --> 01:56:30,083
It's really tough for me.

1514
01:56:31,083 --> 01:56:32,458
I can't live like this.

1515
01:56:33,500 --> 01:56:37,666
You went to my dad to tell the truth
because I was hurt.

1516
01:56:39,166 --> 01:56:42,291
While you were announced
the CEO of such a huge company...

1517
01:56:42,541 --> 01:56:45,083
you went to Mr. Bheeshma
and asked him why.

1518
01:56:49,500 --> 01:56:52,750
Everyone thinks you came here
to be the CEO of this company.

1519
01:56:54,208 --> 01:56:57,958
But only I know you came here for me.

1520
01:56:59,875 --> 01:57:01,875
I get really angry when I look at you.

1521
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,166
Don't you have a limit to loving me?

1522
01:57:06,291 --> 01:57:07,750
Will you do anything for me?

1523
01:57:08,833 --> 01:57:11,375
I said I'll save the company
from your bad influence.

1524
01:57:12,875 --> 01:57:13,791
But...

1525
01:57:14,208 --> 01:57:15,750
This company and I...

1526
01:57:16,375 --> 01:57:21,333
will never find anyone
better to look after us.

1527
01:57:24,875 --> 01:57:26,416
Do whatever you want.

1528
01:57:27,666 --> 01:57:31,208
But marry me without causing any trouble.

1529
01:57:35,083 --> 01:57:36,333
What are you looking at?

1530
01:57:36,833 --> 01:57:38,125
Can I do whatever I want?

1531
01:57:39,708 --> 01:57:40,583
Yes.

1532
01:57:47,166 --> 01:57:49,083
Dad really likes you.

1533
01:57:49,583 --> 01:57:50,791
I heard him tell Mom.

1534
01:57:53,291 --> 01:57:55,791
He might really like me,
but I'm going to marry you.

1535
01:58:08,750 --> 01:58:11,666
<span style="style.center_1">What a beauty! What a beauty!</span>

1536
01:58:11,750 --> 01:58:14,833
<span style="style.center_1">You bring the gentle breezes to town</span>

1537
01:58:20,583 --> 01:58:23,583
<span style="style.center_1">What a beauty! What a beauty!</span>

1538
01:58:23,666 --> 01:58:26,541
<span style="style.center_1">You bring the gentle breezes to town</span>

1539
01:58:26,625 --> 01:58:29,541
<span style="style.center_1">As you sway your waist, you naughty girl</span>

1540
01:58:29,625 --> 01:58:32,625
<span style="style.center_1">My eyes can't stop staring mischievously</span>

1541
01:58:32,708 --> 01:58:35,708
<span style="style.center_1">I feel the chills when you come closer</span>

1542
01:58:35,791 --> 01:58:39,041
<span style="style.center_1">And it gets really</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Suffocating when you go away</span>

1543
01:58:41,333 --> 01:58:44,791
<span style="style.center_1">Why don't you give me a tight hug</span>
<span style="style.center_1">And stick to me forever like a tattoo?</span>

1544
01:58:47,708 --> 01:58:50,208
<span style="style.center_1">My parents are not home</span>

1545
01:58:53,666 --> 01:58:56,625
<span style="style.center_1">Keep the front door open</span>

1546
01:59:26,458 --> 01:59:29,208
<span style="style.center_1">Don't give me those fiery looks, darling</span>

1547
01:59:29,291 --> 01:59:32,500
<span style="style.center_1">I can hear a fire engine tolling its bell</span>

1548
01:59:38,333 --> 01:59:44,166
<span style="style.center_1">Don't waste your time</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Blabbering like a train's horn</span>

1549
01:59:44,250 --> 01:59:50,166
<span style="style.center_1">Don't go out in the sun</span>
<span style="style.center_1">As the sun will start sweating</span>

1550
01:59:50,250 --> 01:59:56,208
<span style="style.center_1">Don't hide all your treasure</span>
<span style="style.center_1">As there will be an income tax raid</span>

1551
01:59:59,291 --> 02:00:01,708
<span style="style.center_1">My parents are not home</span>

1552
02:00:01,791 --> 02:00:05,125
<span style="style.center_1">Twinkle Twinkle, Little Star</span>

1553
02:00:05,250 --> 02:00:08,083
<span style="style.center_1">Keep the front door open</span>

1554
02:00:15,875 --> 02:00:16,750
<span style="style.center_1">Come on!</span>

1555
02:00:38,083 --> 02:00:43,916
<span style="style.center_1">Any surface you touch is</span>
<span style="style.center_1">A direct ticket to paradise</span>

1556
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:45,041
<span style="style.center_1">Oh, yeah!</span>

1557
02:00:46,958 --> 02:00:48,416
<span style="style.center_1">Oh, yeah!</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Come on, baby!</span>

1558
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,750
<span style="style.center_1">I've been single this whole time</span>

1559
02:00:52,916 --> 02:00:55,791
<span style="style.center_1">Shall I be the frame to your picture?</span>

1560
02:00:55,875 --> 02:01:01,708
<span style="style.center_1">The place you set your foot on</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Is the beauty spot on Earth</span>

1561
02:01:01,833 --> 02:01:07,625
<span style="style.center_1">If you were born overseas,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">People there would've been floored</span>

1562
02:01:10,833 --> 02:01:13,416
<span style="style.center_1">My parents are not home</span>

1563
02:01:13,500 --> 02:01:16,583
<span style="style.center_1">Twinkle Twinkle, Little Star</span>

1564
02:01:16,791 --> 02:01:19,625
<span style="style.center_1">Keep the front door open</span>

1565
02:01:23,750 --> 02:01:26,666
You asked me to get the invites ready
for the product launch and I did it.

1566
02:01:27,083 --> 02:01:29,791
You asked me to book
a convention hall and I did it.

1567
02:01:30,125 --> 02:01:32,500
I also confirmed the Minister
as our chief guest.

1568
02:01:32,666 --> 02:01:33,500
But...

1569
02:01:35,750 --> 02:01:38,125
I mean, we didn't acquire the land yet.

1570
02:01:38,208 --> 02:01:40,875
Board members want to know
what's the point of this product launch.

1571
02:01:41,041 --> 02:01:43,791
Tell them the downfall of
Bheeshma Organics has begun.

1572
02:01:44,666 --> 02:01:45,500
How is that?

1573
02:02:07,833 --> 02:02:12,208
Sir, there are chemical foods
in the storage units of Bheeshma Organics.

1574
02:02:25,250 --> 02:02:27,500
Sir, chemical value has been
detected in all of them.

1575
02:02:53,125 --> 02:02:55,833
This will be the last time
someone calls you that.

1576
02:02:56,458 --> 02:03:00,125
Remember telling me how
you're a step ahead of me?

1577
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:02,708
Now, I'm going to predict your future.

1578
02:03:03,458 --> 02:03:07,666
Reports will be out soon that
your company has chemical foods.

1579
02:03:08,666 --> 02:03:12,458
That will break the trust of people,
built over 40 years.

1580
02:03:12,958 --> 02:03:17,208
Your board members will fire you
because of this reason.

1581
02:03:19,500 --> 02:03:22,791
Your chapter as a CEO is thus closed.

1582
02:03:24,333 --> 02:03:27,000
That old man was highly
concerned about the plants.

1583
02:03:27,750 --> 02:03:30,125
Now, a plant is going to bring him down.

1584
02:03:30,583 --> 02:03:31,500
Don't you get it?

1585
02:03:35,166 --> 02:03:39,375
I gifted him a rare plant on the day
he announced you as the CEO.

1586
02:03:40,375 --> 02:03:42,041
A normal plant would've been harmless.

1587
02:03:42,375 --> 02:03:44,250
But it's a hybrid plant that I formulated.

1588
02:03:45,333 --> 02:03:47,166
You should pinch its
leaves for it to grow.

1589
02:03:48,083 --> 02:03:51,500
It releases a poisonous gas
every time you pinch it.

1590
02:03:51,916 --> 02:03:57,333
That affects your nervous system
and leaves you bedridden for life.

1591
02:04:01,458 --> 02:04:03,583
I'm launching my product tomorrow.

1592
02:04:04,291 --> 02:04:08,750
My executives will visit all the
villages associated with you.

1593
02:04:09,708 --> 02:04:13,875
They'll tell them Bheeshma
has broken their trust.

1594
02:04:14,375 --> 02:04:17,750
And make them sign with our company.

1595
02:04:19,666 --> 02:04:21,375
Your company will be shut down.

1596
02:04:21,916 --> 02:04:25,083
My company will be number one in India.

1597
02:04:27,666 --> 02:04:29,166
This is how you execute a plan.

1598
02:04:30,041 --> 02:04:31,750
Cheap fellow!

1599
02:04:45,125 --> 02:04:46,041
Hello!

1600
02:04:57,041 --> 02:05:00,958
With the increasing population, comes
a need for increase in food production.

1601
02:05:01,833 --> 02:05:04,458
After years of blood and sweat...

1602
02:05:04,875 --> 02:05:07,875
we present to you
the revolutionary product, "Instant!"

1603
02:05:09,250 --> 02:05:13,333
This product is aimed
at... helping the farmers.

1604
02:05:13,875 --> 02:05:16,000
My heartfelt thanks
to our Honorable Minister...

1605
02:05:16,208 --> 02:05:19,791
of Chemicals and Fertilizers,
Mr. Ajay Varma.

1606
02:05:20,958 --> 02:05:25,125
Now, I'll request Chief Guest
Mr. Ajay Varma to speak a few words.

1607
02:05:38,291 --> 02:05:40,166
I come from an ordinary farmer's family.

1608
02:05:40,666 --> 02:05:43,000
A farmer provides us three
meals a day and yet...

1609
02:05:43,625 --> 02:05:45,375
he hardly gets to have one meal a day.

1610
02:05:46,291 --> 02:05:50,791
Mr. Raghavan met me with a wonderful
opportunity to change this fate.

1611
02:05:52,041 --> 02:05:53,541
He told me about his product.

1612
02:05:54,666 --> 02:05:56,041
I was really happy...

1613
02:05:57,250 --> 02:05:58,833
that it does the farmers good.

1614
02:06:03,291 --> 02:06:04,541
But then, I realized...

1615
02:06:04,916 --> 02:06:09,708
this product is being made with a harmful
chemical that's banned in 13 countries.

1616
02:06:17,291 --> 02:06:19,791
And its usage deteriorates the soil.

1617
02:06:27,375 --> 02:06:29,375
I could've disapproved
the product back then.

1618
02:06:32,833 --> 02:06:35,291
I could stop this only because
my Government is in power now.

1619
02:06:35,750 --> 02:06:37,791
What if the opposition party comes
to power in the next election?

1620
02:06:38,208 --> 02:06:40,250
What if they get greedy
and approve this product?

1621
02:06:40,416 --> 02:06:43,625
I came all the way to let
the public know the truth.

1622
02:06:45,291 --> 02:06:47,500
Raiding team told me that
the remaining products...

1623
02:06:47,583 --> 02:06:51,041
from Field Science are also
against Government norms.

1624
02:07:08,500 --> 02:07:09,333
Hail India!

1625
02:07:13,750 --> 02:07:14,583
Sir... Sir...

1626
02:07:14,666 --> 02:07:16,125
Is that the truth?

1627
02:07:16,208 --> 02:07:18,000
How do you feel now?

1628
02:07:18,083 --> 02:07:20,125
Bheeshma won't create a problem for us.

1629
02:07:20,291 --> 02:07:22,583
We will.

1630
02:07:52,583 --> 02:07:54,166
I see...

1631
02:07:55,583 --> 02:07:59,416
that nothing happened
to you or the old man.

1632
02:08:01,291 --> 02:08:05,833
It took me months to meet the Minister.

1633
02:08:07,458 --> 02:08:10,833
How'd you manage to influence him?

1634
02:08:14,500 --> 02:08:18,000
I was told that things fall into place
when your ambition is great.

1635
02:08:18,250 --> 02:08:20,500
Mr. Bheeshma's ambition is really great.

1636
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:22,916
He made me the CEO...

1637
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,416
and the three characters in my life
led me to this moment.

1638
02:08:26,791 --> 02:08:27,875
You don't get it, do you?

1639
02:08:28,333 --> 02:08:31,125
Mr. Bheeshma was admitted to the hospital
due to high fever.

1640
02:08:31,500 --> 02:08:33,041
Not because of the plant you sent him.

1641
02:08:35,166 --> 02:08:37,125
Sir, a gift for Mr. Bheeshma.

1642
02:08:39,750 --> 02:08:41,125
Sir, you've received a gift.

1643
02:08:41,541 --> 02:08:42,416
Give me.

1644
02:08:46,291 --> 02:08:50,375
I'll not do anything positive for you.

1645
02:08:51,208 --> 02:08:55,541
Look. Your plant and your plan...

1646
02:08:55,875 --> 02:08:57,166
I've crushed them both.

1647
02:08:58,333 --> 02:09:00,458
Sorry, bro. You just lost your third job.

1648
02:09:00,708 --> 02:09:01,625
Why?

1649
02:09:02,125 --> 02:09:03,458
I don't have so many degrees.

1650
02:09:03,625 --> 02:09:05,375
The gift wasn't for me.

1651
02:09:05,458 --> 02:09:06,791
It was for Mr. Bheeshma.

1652
02:09:08,291 --> 02:09:09,583
Please, help me out.

1653
02:09:09,875 --> 02:09:10,708
No big deal.

1654
02:09:10,833 --> 02:09:12,458
Gift him another similar plant.

1655
02:09:13,708 --> 02:09:16,916
Local police stations are informed
when there's a raid on a company.

1656
02:09:18,791 --> 02:09:20,583
What you don't know is...

1657
02:09:21,333 --> 02:09:22,833
ACP is my father-in-law.

1658
02:09:23,083 --> 02:09:25,291
Sir, chemical value has been
detected in all of them.

1659
02:09:26,458 --> 02:09:28,125
Chemicals in Bheeshma Organics?

1660
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:30,000
No chance!

1661
02:09:30,500 --> 02:09:31,583
What do you say, officers?

1662
02:09:31,791 --> 02:09:33,916
Yes, sir. This machine is broken.

1663
02:09:36,166 --> 02:09:38,833
Ravi, call the guy who fed us
the wrong information.

1664
02:09:51,125 --> 02:09:52,625
I'll do whatever you tell me.

1665
02:09:55,041 --> 02:09:57,333
Ever since you told me you
were launching a product...

1666
02:09:57,458 --> 02:10:00,666
I started enquiring about it.

1667
02:10:00,833 --> 02:10:02,541
I came to know it's
a really harmful product.

1668
02:10:02,625 --> 02:10:06,333
My only resort to stop your product
launch in such a short span was...

1669
02:10:06,416 --> 02:10:07,250
the Minister!

1670
02:10:07,416 --> 02:10:10,583
But I didn't know how to meet him
or what to tell him.

1671
02:10:11,375 --> 02:10:12,583
I decided to do it anyway.

1672
02:10:13,041 --> 02:10:18,250
So, I took my uncle's ID card and went
to the hotel to meet the Minister.

1673
02:10:28,041 --> 02:10:31,166
I saw your brother
and didn't know where to go.

1674
02:10:32,541 --> 02:10:33,791
So, I got into the next room.

1675
02:10:47,416 --> 02:10:48,500
What are you doing here?

1676
02:10:48,583 --> 02:10:50,125
Hey, Sara! What are you--

1677
02:10:50,208 --> 02:10:52,375
-Quiet! Please, leave.
-What are you doing here?

1678
02:11:06,666 --> 02:11:08,333
I've heard all about the fantasies.

1679
02:11:09,125 --> 02:11:10,833
But I'm witnessing one
for the first time.

1680
02:11:12,125 --> 02:11:16,166
Sir... are you the last standing
warrior amongst the 300?

1681
02:11:16,750 --> 02:11:19,208
Is that a pen camera?

1682
02:11:31,541 --> 02:11:34,333
The channel will telecast it on a loop,
once I give them the clip.

1683
02:11:34,458 --> 02:11:35,750
No. Please, don't do it.

1684
02:11:36,708 --> 02:11:37,958
I'll do whatever it takes.

1685
02:11:39,666 --> 02:11:40,625
Check this file.

1686
02:11:45,416 --> 02:11:46,666
How do you know him?

1687
02:11:47,958 --> 02:11:50,000
Just like I know you from
a pre-wedding party...

1688
02:11:50,125 --> 02:11:51,666
I know Ajju from a post-wedding party.

1689
02:11:52,208 --> 02:11:55,041
He liked me. I liked his money.

1690
02:11:55,125 --> 02:11:58,458
Every time he's in Hyderabad,
we take connecting rooms and...

1691
02:11:58,541 --> 02:11:59,958
But the hotels are risky.

1692
02:12:00,208 --> 02:12:01,750
He owns this hotel.

1693
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:09,458
Talk about everything on that file.

1694
02:12:09,541 --> 02:12:12,250
You'll win the next elections as well
for supporting the farmers.

1695
02:12:13,500 --> 02:12:14,416
Definitely.

1696
02:12:15,625 --> 02:12:17,000
What about the video?

1697
02:12:17,625 --> 02:12:19,791
It's safe with me, Spartan.

1698
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,375
You can win a battle with someone strong.

1699
02:12:27,708 --> 02:12:29,833
But you can never win
a battle with someone lucky.

1700
02:12:31,208 --> 02:12:32,500
You're a lucky man.

1701
02:12:32,958 --> 02:12:36,625
The old man made a good
decision by selecting you.

1702
02:12:39,958 --> 02:12:41,750
Why did he select you in the first place?

1703
02:12:43,833 --> 02:12:46,958
I swear, I don't have
the answer to this question.

1704
02:12:47,208 --> 02:12:49,166
Today is the 31st day.
Maybe, I'll find out.

1705
02:12:54,583 --> 02:12:58,958
Our company has completed 50 years.

1706
02:12:59,458 --> 02:13:00,791
This is my dream.

1707
02:13:01,750 --> 02:13:03,166
This is our hard work.

1708
02:13:04,208 --> 02:13:06,250
This is life for many farmers.

1709
02:13:09,375 --> 02:13:11,958
I won't entrust this responsibility
on some stranger.

1710
02:13:13,875 --> 02:13:15,791
The very first time I saw him...

1711
02:13:17,041 --> 02:13:19,625
I hoped he'd be my future.

1712
02:13:33,166 --> 02:13:35,000
-Let's go, sir.
-Hold on.

1713
02:14:05,791 --> 02:14:07,458
After a few days...

1714
02:14:08,208 --> 02:14:10,541
I saw him at the farming meet.

1715
02:14:10,958 --> 02:14:15,000
Watching him talk about
organic farming in detail...

1716
02:14:15,125 --> 02:14:18,125
I thought he must have pursued
many degrees in agriculture.

1717
02:14:18,708 --> 02:14:19,708
When I inquired...

1718
02:14:20,708 --> 02:14:22,416
I found out that he's a dropout.

1719
02:14:23,416 --> 02:14:26,916
Also, he learned the subject
for Chaithra.

1720
02:14:28,916 --> 02:14:32,666
He stood tall and courageous
to save a stranger's life.

1721
02:14:33,583 --> 02:14:37,541
I was sure he'd stand
for the people around him.

1722
02:14:39,458 --> 02:14:44,291
He'd do anything
for someone he loves.

1723
02:14:45,208 --> 02:14:50,250
And he'd do the same for
my ideas if he loved them.

1724
02:14:52,625 --> 02:14:53,916
In these 30 days...

1725
02:14:54,458 --> 02:14:57,750
he saved a whole village from
being exploited.

1726
02:14:59,750 --> 02:15:04,250
He forced the government to
ban a harmful chemical.

1727
02:15:06,125 --> 02:15:10,833
Where can we find such a
responsible man like this?

1728
02:15:22,541 --> 02:15:25,541
Any objections?

1729
02:15:31,333 --> 02:15:32,583
I'll do whatever you tell me.

1730
02:15:32,875 --> 02:15:35,000
Mr. Bheeshma has never taken
a wrong decision.

1731
02:15:35,291 --> 02:15:38,416
Let us all affirm Junior Bheeshma
as our next CEO.

1732
02:15:59,958 --> 02:16:01,625
You said that you know goons in Bihar.

1733
02:16:03,250 --> 02:16:04,500
Don't you know anyone local?

1734
02:16:05,291 --> 02:16:06,916
I've tried it, bro.

1735
02:16:07,083 --> 02:16:09,500
It didn't work out.
That's why, I mentioned Bihar.

1736
02:16:10,125 --> 02:16:11,166
When did you send goons?

1737
02:16:11,500 --> 02:16:12,791
When you were in the lab.

1738
02:16:13,416 --> 02:16:16,125
Our sales dropped drastically
because of them.

1739
02:16:17,125 --> 02:16:18,666
I got embarrassed and sent them.

1740
02:16:23,666 --> 02:16:25,458
If you hadn't sent them...

1741
02:16:25,916 --> 02:16:27,416
that old man would've gone home.

1742
02:16:28,166 --> 02:16:29,708
Bheeshma would've gone some other way.

1743
02:16:31,375 --> 02:16:35,375
You helped the two meet
and put me in this position.

1744
02:16:38,458 --> 02:16:42,125
I thought that bad luck came
into my life in the form of Bheeshma.

1745
02:16:45,500 --> 02:16:48,291
But it came into my life as my brother.

1746
02:16:49,666 --> 02:16:52,041
Bro, there are goons in Bulgaria as well.

1747
02:16:53,166 --> 02:16:54,583
-I'll kill myself!
-Okay, sorry!

1748
02:17:06,583 --> 02:17:07,583
I drank it in a hurry.

1749
02:17:14,250 --> 02:17:15,708
Take a seat. I'll be right back.

1750
02:17:16,166 --> 02:17:17,000
Hey!

1751
02:17:17,083 --> 02:17:18,750
Why are you plucking flowers
like some crazy person?

1752
02:17:18,833 --> 02:17:20,250
-I'm nervous, man.
-Why?

1753
02:17:20,916 --> 02:17:23,125
Deva still thinks your son
is Bheeshma's grandson.

1754
02:17:23,500 --> 02:17:24,458
You're amazing, sir.

1755
02:17:24,666 --> 02:17:27,875
He became a CEO because of your training.
Now, he's becoming your son-in-law.

1756
02:17:28,125 --> 02:17:30,666
I'm not accepting him as my
son-in-law because he's a CEO...

1757
02:17:31,166 --> 02:17:33,250
I'm accepting him because he is
Mr. Bheeshma's grandson.

1758
02:17:33,416 --> 02:17:35,125
-He's Mr. Bheeshma's grandson?
-Yes.

1759
02:17:35,500 --> 02:17:36,541
How do you know that, sir?

1760
02:17:37,083 --> 02:17:38,583
This is why you're a constable.

1761
02:17:38,958 --> 02:17:39,958
And I'm the ACP.

1762
02:17:40,375 --> 02:17:41,958
Well said, sir. You're great!

1763
02:17:42,250 --> 02:17:43,375
-He still thinks so?
-Yes.

1764
02:17:43,500 --> 02:17:46,125
He couldn't figure this out?
How did he crack IPS?

1765
02:17:46,416 --> 02:17:48,916
And he's always
bragging about his gold medal.

1766
02:17:49,083 --> 02:17:50,500
I know, right?

1767
02:17:54,541 --> 02:17:58,250
I was "Single Forever."
Now, I'm "Single For Never."
