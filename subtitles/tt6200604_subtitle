00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:37,205
TMV

2
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:57,623
What are you planning
to do, Baby Cherian?

3
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:01,594
There are only 3 months left.
Will you get it done?

4
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:05,568
Everyone has families
and difficulties.

5
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:08,771
lf you don't try hard, you can't
achieve yourtarget! Let me warn you!

6
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:10,142
Baby!

7
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:12,769
Despite having such a good team..
lt's really sad!

8
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:13,879
Hey Baby!

9
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:16,280
- Move!
- Come down fast!

10
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:18,850
You son hasjumped from the top
of Thonekkunnu hill again!

11
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:20,052
Come fast!

12
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:22,177
- This has become a routine now!
- Come fast!

13
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,882
- lmagine that the
policy holder is dead.

14
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,117
- lt's not like LlC.

15
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:28,353
- lf you pay one premium, you'll
be covered for your whole life!

16
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:30,687
The company will pay back
your money with interest!

17
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:31,855
Eldo, start the car!

18
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,601
Stop your bloody song!

19
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:38,597
lt's the latest song!

20
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:45,202
- His first jump was 2
years back, Doctor.

21
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:47,079
- Fix it!
- Yes Sir!

22
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:20,244
Jesus Christ!

23
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:27,119
Clara!

24
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,187
Clara!

25
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:29,922
Hey!

26
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:33,292
His second jump was during
the first Holy Communion

27
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:36,728
of our Sub-Engineer Xavier
Sir's sister's eldest son.

28
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:41,860
(Church choir singing)

29
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,155
- Where is Aby, dear?.
- l don't know!

30
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:09,695
Oh God!

31
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:37,824
- Eldo!
- What's it, Baby?

32
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:39,018
He jumped again!

33
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:40,393
- Start the car!
- Open the door!

34
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:41,360
Put him inside!

35
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,326
Get in!
Come on!

36
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:45,421
- Peter!
- Go, go! l'm holding tight!

37
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:47,959
Stop your damn song!

38
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:53,803
ls everything in place?

39
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:59,344
Since Christ was there to save him in the
form of a lorry carrying rubber sheets,

40
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:00,344
he didn't die!

41
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:02,107
Only this much happened!

42
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,282
Christ?

43
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,446
ln the form of a lorry?

44
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:12,925
One,

45
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:14,059
Two,

46
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:15,160
Three..

47
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:16,428
Four,

48
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:19,224
Make it fast! l've to go
to a couple more places!

49
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,233
Sir, l can't find the
neutral wire of this thing!

50
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:24,197
Working in KSEB,

51
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,135
and you don't know which
is the neutral wire!

52
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:28,039
Hold that black wire!

53
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:29,408
Oh my God!

54
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:32,311
That's phase, and the one
next to it is neutral.

55
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:33,938
Don't get it wrong hereafter!
- No!

56
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,310
Sir, what are we gonna do
about Mathachan's connection?

57
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,410
He's going on calling!

58
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:41,982
When l asked him to
get me 2 bottles,

59
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:45,023
he told me that he doesn't want a
connection by giving alcohol & water!

60
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:48,820
He doesn't know that current
is generated from water!

61
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,292
Mathachan will be
in deep water!

62
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:57,035
That was one hell
of a jump, doctor!

63
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:01,799
Look Papa,
it's Aby!

64
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:03,909
Aby!

65
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,447
Son!

66
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:10,273
Hey, don't jump!

67
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:13,285
Stop there!

68
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:14,453
Sonny!

69
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,412
Hey!

70
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:18,587
Oh my God!

71
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:27,125
Looks like he has all the water
of ldukki dam inside him!

72
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:29,401
Papa!

73
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:35,201
lnstead of Mathachan, it's
Sir who was in deep water!

74
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:39,844
There goes Xavier Sir's liver!

75
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,553
Get lost!

76
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:03,069
Who said that he is deaf?.

77
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:04,229
And that he cannot speak?

78
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:05,304
Well..

79
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:09,075
ln spite of being stuck in front of the
fireworks at the Church festival,

80
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:10,940
- Sit down!
- he didn't make a sound, doctor!

81
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:12,644
That's when we had a doubt.

82
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:15,615
And Dr. Sukumaran from our
neighbourhood also said

83
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,913
that it will be quite difficult
to get him to speak.

84
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:19,918
He will speak.

85
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,212
He can hear as well.

86
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:25,050
But he has to feel that
he wants to do it.

87
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,457
The vision & thought process
of such kids are different.

88
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:31,892
They won't be seeing many things
in the same way as we do.

89
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:35,232
They are the ones who dream
even when they are awake!

90
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,967
Aby Baby.

91
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:40,037
He's a special baby.

92
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,132
A special one!

93
00:10:54,553 --> 00:11:00,355
Friends, the fireworks spectacle we were
all waiting for, is about to begin.

94
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:17,271
Team DrC

95
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:46,434
This madness is age-old.

96
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:48,969
Socrates, Einstein,

97
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:50,342
Archimedes,

98
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:51,570
and our Gandhi.

99
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:56,045
Each one of them had a madness
which toppled this world.

100
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:00,086
An intellectual madness.

101
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:01,485
At the pinnacle of this madness,

102
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:03,178
in 1912,

103
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:05,318
this man called
Fran ois Reichelt,

104
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,584
jumped from the top
of Eiffel Tower,

105
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,218
while the police & the
army stood watching.

106
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:12,093
And did he fly?

107
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,196
Sparks flew out of his eyes!

108
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:22,571
So many others after that.

109
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:26,412
How many ever times you throw stones
to get the mango from its tree,

110
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,115
only that one throw that brought the
mango down would be remembered!

111
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:30,241
People will talk
only about that!

112
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:31,782
Who threw stones at
the mango tree here?

113
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,247
Hey Baburaj!
lt's for you!

114
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:37,723
Baby,

115
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,224
your son;

116
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:40,492
He will fly!

117
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,753
How much did you spend
this time, Baby?

118
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:48,161
Good that there were no
fractures this time.

119
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,234
Jeena Chechi, keep this there.

120
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,377
Shall l go?
The bucket is lying there.

121
00:12:58,377 --> 00:12:59,678
What did Father Thondel say?

122
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:02,738
He said that he will write a letter
to a new special school at Painavu.

123
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:08,287
Since there will be other kids like
him, he might make friends easily!

124
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,555
- That's true!
- Jeena!

125
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:10,522
Here you go!

126
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:12,649
Give it to them.

127
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,157
Get him admitted to
some such school.

128
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:17,126
Or else, the whole town
will be in deep water.

129
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:21,565
l think the frog is still
inside my stomach.

130
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,497
Should l swallow a
snake to kill it?

131
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:27,739
Hey.. What did Baby say?

132
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:31,368
Don't bother about him.
l'm taking my son anyway.

133
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,771
Keep this.
The money forthe eggs.

134
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,344
- This has extra money!
- Keep it! What if you need it?

135
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:45,149
Let me know if you
need any other help.

136
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:50,362
Anu!

137
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:51,396
Come!

138
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:56,592
- Okay. Here you go.

139
00:13:57,603 --> 00:13:59,298
lt's okay.
l'll take it later.

140
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:02,296
- l have to go to her house.

141
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,173
- Ya. l'll be here for 2 months.

142
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,677
- Okay then.

143
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:11,910

'With fresh, flying

151
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:51,753
He doesn't have any such
problems like you've imagined.

152
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:54,483
l just hope he starts talking.

153
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,226
Everything will be all right.

154
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:57,796
Right?

155
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,534
You're smart!

What's the point of
taking medicines in vain?

161
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,318
You shouldn't keep working!

162
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:54,616
You shouldn't lift heavy weights.
But you won't listen to me!

163
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:57,780
Son, you should make
your mother understand.

164
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:00,383

Say it, dear.

181

'Amma'

182
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,014
Like hell, he would say!

183
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:38,457
You better go to sleep!

184
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:53,566
Team DrC

185
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:55,906
- Where's your mother?
- She's on bed rest. Why?

186
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:57,409
Just like that.

187
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,635
- Then take a trip to Mars & come back!
- Why?

188
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:00,643
Just like that!

189
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:01,813
Get lost, Baby!

190
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,674

Akele Tum.

What is this, man?

193
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:08,644
lt's a Hindi film, Father.

194
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:13,418
Hey!
Stay calm!

195
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:19,688
Father!

- Hey Peter!

197
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:24,961
He's talking about
some insurance policy.

198
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,837
Whatever it is, ask him directly.

199
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:30,065
lsn't this like Mangium
& Money-Chain?

200
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:31,940
l lost a lot of
money on Mangium.

201
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:33,843
l don't want to lose
more money, Father.

202
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,073
Join it if you can.
His kid is not well.

207
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,420
lt's not because l need this.

208
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:50,762
This is for the kid.

209
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:52,093
l also have a
little one at home.

210
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:54,866
Okay.

211
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:04,665
- What do you want, Baby?
- Just a plain tea.

212
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:08,780
You don't have to bother
about anything else.

213
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,179
lf sentiments work, use it!

214
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,413
Hereafter, take your son along,
when you go for field work.

215
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,987
You should cover yourtarget, right?

216
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:22,155
You are doing this job
for him as well, right?

217
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,024
One double omelette!

218
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:28,161
- One double
omelette over there!

219
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,974
Did you wear your slippers, son?

220
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:52,957
Come!

221
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,960
l'll take the child. You stay here.
You're unwell, right?

222
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,170
Sit properly.

223
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:06,738
l..

224
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:12,578
- Sicily will come next week, right?
- Yes.

225
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:14,944
l have good policies for people
staying in the middle east.

226
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:30,128
Brother!

227
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:31,957
That ladder is damaged!

228
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,722
Who knows when something
would happen?

229
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:35,924
lf you don't get a policy,
phew!

230
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:37,159
- Baby!
- Yes!

231
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:39,270
- Have you taken a policy?
- No. l have to.

232
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:41,232
- Why?
- Then get one soon.

233
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:43,734
Once l come down, you
won't have the time for it.

234
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:45,610
Move your hand.

235
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:53,709
l was just an accountant
at a utensil shop.

236
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:58,587
And today, l am this
company's inspector!

237
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:00,556
Under me,

238
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:04,128
Hey!

00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,230
Listen to me.

240
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:08,862
There are 760 agents
working under me.

241
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:11,667
You know how much
my commission is?

242
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:13,131
65,000.

243
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:15,139
How much?

244
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:17,104
65,000!

245
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,868
l just have to sit at home!

246
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:21,011
The cheques keep coming!

247
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,137
- Sir, bill.
- Huh?

248
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,248
230.

249
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:39,798
Jayan Chetta, are you leaving?

250
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,066
l was just leaving.

251
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:42,601
l'll finish this now.

252
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:43,898
This is the scheme
l told you about.

253
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:47,029
- My dear Baby, this is not possible!
- lt will be!

254
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:49,039
What is this?
Don't you sleep well?

255
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:50,909
'Mariyapuram development
procession'

256
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:52,308
Stop the price
reduction of rubber!

257
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:54,212
- l'll fill the rest.

258
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:55,873
Long live the working class!

259
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:00,807
'At Mariyapuram Panchayat, there's
not even a drop of water'

260
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:02,615
Long back, everyone used to fly!

261
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:04,022
Humans,

262
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:05,090
trees,

263
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,648
cats, dogs,

264
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:08,051
and everyone else!

265
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:12,122
And gradually, everyone stopped
standing on the ground!

266
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,026
Then God asked
everyone to come down.

267
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:17,329
Audacious creatures!

268
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:19,100
None of them listened to God.

269
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:21,867
Would God leave them alone?

270
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:24,606
He chopped all their wings off!

271
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:29,675
But can His tricks
work against humans?

272
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:35,978
lnstead of those chopped wings,
humans invented an airplane!

273
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:41,693
Fly it!

274
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:51,200

Chechi,

277
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:25,870
l was wondering what happened to Aby when
l didn't see him in the bus for few days.

278
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:27,768
But how will you send him
when you're unwell?

279
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:42,752
He's taking that ailing child to toddy
shops, street vendors & brandy shops,

280
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:44,982
to make people take insurance
policies from him.

281
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:46,881
Such a bad thing to do!

282
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,396
Please don't fight with him when you
go home, because l told this to you.

Where's the comb?

285
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:22,292
You didn't even come to
admit him in the school!

286
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,952
And the priest is
paying the fees!

287
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:27,895
And l have to make the money for
conveyance by selling eggs & farming!

288
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,901
You're making your own child beg for
money & drinking with that money?

289
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:33,800
You will never learn!

290
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:37,071
- l will kick you!
- Don't hesitate! Kill me!

291
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:38,976

00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:41,271

with your son! Come!

'Do you know how much my commission is?'

298
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:09,906
'65,000'

299
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:17,044
- You rascal!
- Don't hurt my child!

300
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,149
Give him to me!

301
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,017
Move away, you!

302
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:23,545
- l suffered so much..
- Don't kill my child!

303
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,220
Have you gone mad?

304
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:30,852
- l worked so hard for this!
- Oh God! He will kill us today!

305
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:34,065
Yes!

306
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:36,531
My bad times started
the day he was born!

307

- Chacko!
- Yes!

308

milk is less this time.

Yes.

310
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,246
Hey,

00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:40,631
Aby!

358
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,932
- The pump is damaged!
- Shall l start?

359
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,633
- Ravi Chetta, shall l start?
- Wait! l'll tell you!

360
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:53,711
Ya. Start now!

361
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:56,947
Enough!

362
00:31:57,515 --> 00:31:59,684
lt will take some time.
What time is the wedding?

363
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:00,818
Between 10 & 10.45 AM.

364
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:02,954
- Can you change it?
- How? - Well.. l wasjust asking.

365
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:04,649
- Where is Aby?
- There he is!

366
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,794
Where the hell were you? When
you have so much work here!

367
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:18,796
lt will take some time!

368
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:20,666
The wedding will be over by then!

369
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,707
- Are you going in this?
- Yes.

370
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:24,976
Then you can attend their
child's birthday party as well!

371
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:27,501
- This car is in good condition!
- When it was bought, right?

372
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:29,470
Dad, we'll get a taxi!

373
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:31,649
Ambiswamy is preparing
the wedding feast!

374
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:33,618
What to do if we're
not meant to have it!

375
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:34,585
True!

376
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,322
Hey! Don't do anything
to the nozzle.

377
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:38,414
l checked all that!

378
00:32:55,873 --> 00:32:57,363
How much?

379
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,477
No need of any money.
lt was a silly problem!

380
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:00,478
Get in!

381
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:01,945
Ravi Aashan, he will
make you shut shop!

382
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:04,548
Move!

383
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,782

00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:22,323
l don't want it!

387
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:27,960
He left already?

388
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:30,941
l made his favourite
'ldiyappam' today!

389
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:34,000
Don't bother! He
will get it himself!

390
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,780
Ya. We should have
given him some money!

391
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:44,789
-Are you late again, dear?
- Huh?

392
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:46,724
l mean.. Are you
late again, Anumol?

393
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:48,526
People who do their
home-work are like that.

394
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:49,660
We might be a little late.

395
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,928
Don't be late.
You can..

396
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:52,418
Keep this on my seat.

397
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:53,630
What about you?

398
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:54,665
l'll walk!

399
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:56,758
Then l'll also walk.

400
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:58,035
Why?

401
00:33:58,369 --> 00:33:59,937
Or else.. We'll go on the cycle.

402
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:02,940
No! The new teacher is coming forthe
first period! lt's time for the bell!

403
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:03,907
l'm leaving!

404

since the time we took baby steps,

realize my love..

407
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:17,920
for you..

408
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:21,517
No girl should be so innocent.

409
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:24,658
l want to tell her.

410
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:26,319
But l don't know why..

411

each time l try..

412
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,064

- Yes Sir.
- Get in.

So one by one..

420
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:21,640
We can start from here..

We organize science fairs to find new
scientists & to encourage their talent.

l heard about this school's participation
until last year. So this year you should!

430
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:46,475
Who knows whether we have an
Archimedes or Einstein amongst us?

431
00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:47,678
We have Newton, Sir!

432
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:48,872
- Where?
- Here!

433
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:50,045
ls it?

434
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:52,649
Did an apple fall on your head?

435
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:53,751
Not an apple, Sir.

436
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:57,187
When he was sitting under a coconut tree &
thinking, a baby coconut fell on his head!

437
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:00,850
Now he just keeps thinking!
But has no sense!

438
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:04,456
And when Bindita lost her hair-pin,
he was the one who discovered it!

439
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:05,791
- ls it?
- Get lost, you dog!

440
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:07,632
He even put it back
on her head, Sir.

441
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:09,122
- Get lost!
- l swear!

442
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:11,132
Silence!

443
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:12,993
ls that true, Brijeesh?

444
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:18,075
So, who used to go for the science
fairs in the previous years?

445
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,200
lt was Aby, Sir.

446
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:20,466
And where is he?

447
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:22,203
He is in the workshop, Sir.

448
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,207
He will either be in the
lab or in the library!

449
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:29,211
He does everything alone!

450
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,953
And he doesn't talk to anyone.

451
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:33,215
We are short of glasses.

452
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:35,987
Then there's Anumol Xavier.

453
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,559
She is his only friend.

454
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,120
Look!
He made all this!

00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:44,100

457
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:46,827
There are many such items.

458
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:48,097
And he has won prizes as well!

459
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,140
Why did such a talented
boy stop his studies?

460
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:52,003
That's because of his dad!

461
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,471
And there's some fault
from his side too!

462
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:56,710
lt was during the last vacation,

463
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:59,250
when NCC's para-sailing camp
was happening at the hill-top;

464
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,218

of the situation.

by a foreigner.

David Barish!

469
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:19,003
lf you tie ropes to the four ends
of a something like a blanket,

470
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:21,699
and go stand on a hill-top, in the
opposite direction of the wind;

471
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:23,865
the wind sweeps you off and
takes you along with it!

472
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:26,243
lt is good fun!

473
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:30,807
And the para-sailing by NCC;

474
00:37:31,115 --> 00:37:32,082
We can do that!

475
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:33,874
But we need proper
training for that.

476
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:42,924
Will he jump again?

477
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:45,128
What happened?

478
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,234

479
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:52,968

- Sir, l want to do it!

480

- They have started!
- Sir, please sir!

481
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,073
Leave me!

482
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:02,346
Hey, this is not something which
you can do on one fine morning.

483
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:05,116
You need practice! And, are
you part of NCC? No, right?

484
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,183
Sir, please!

485
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:08,151

by me or our school!

force for NCC students

487
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:12,720
who were selected from different
parts of the country!

488
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,121
- Sir, please!
- Try to understand!

489
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,020

- Don't do anything!
- Who the hell is he?

500
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:14,685
Leave him.

501
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:16,020

502
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,317
Get lost, you idiot!

503
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:19,821
What are you doing, Aby?

504
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:21,858

- Exams are nearing!

508

Read softly!

509

Anyway, let him finish
his exams, Baby.

510
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:53,424
- You can send him to me afterthat.
- Why?

511
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:56,761
What's he going to do for this exam which
he's been writing for the past 3 years?

512
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:59,127
Absolutely!

513
00:39:59,196 --> 00:40:01,298

work during that time,

in the future a + the b2 a2 -....

515
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,168
- Sheesh!
- So many people have become like that!

516
00:40:05,936 --> 00:40:06,903
Hey!

517
00:40:07,171 --> 00:40:09,867
From tomorrow, that
will be your school.

How's the new member?.

523
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:38,997
He disappears in between.

524
00:40:39,136 --> 00:40:40,694
But when he's here,
he works hard.

525
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:43,431
What is it overthere?

526
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:47,708
Anyway; with that Aby's
schooling was stopped!

527

- Hey Sottu!
- Yes!

528
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:55,219
- Where's the 6-8 spanner?.
- l don't know! l didn't take it!

529
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:56,454
Nothing is in its place here!

530
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,081
-Aashan!
- l got a job!

531
00:40:58,222 --> 00:41:00,452
- What job? Who gave you the job?
-A government job!

532
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:01,758
ls it?

533
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,017
ln the Revenue department.

534
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:05,830
Then shave off that
beard of yours!

535
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:06,797
Okay! See you!

536
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:09,257
- Bennykkutty!
- What?

537
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:12,369
Your Tyre on the
back-wheel was worn out.

538
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:14,803
l've changed that. And
l've changed the oil too!

539
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:16,497
Keep this wheel here.
l'll take it later.

540
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:19,068
Hey flying machine!

541
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:26,773
Give something to him.
lt's his wage.

542
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,878
There's something at home which
he made from last month's wage.

543
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:31,454
Something this long!

544
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,291
Anyway, he would have
his own needs, right?

545
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:35,517
Needs!

546
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,227
Why is this guy like this!

547
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,466
- Hey!
- Here comes the snake head!

548
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:44,423
Send Aby to get some fish.

549
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,094
Can't you see that
he's working here?

550
00:41:46,203 --> 00:41:47,864
Where is he?
Send him!

551
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:49,039
He is busy!

552
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,307
What's he busy with?

553
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:52,432
He's making a project
for the science fair.

554
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:53,873
Aby, come here.

555
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:55,403
Go Aby!

556
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:56,878
Or she won't let me be at peace.

557
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:13,525
This cover is damaged.

558
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:17,829
The sardine looks delicious!

559
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:20,302
Afterthis year's science
fair, everyone will know..

560
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:22,200
who the actual Newton is!

561
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:25,438
You think that you
are brilliant,

562
00:42:26,443 --> 00:42:28,001
because everyone
keeps praising you!

563
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:30,013
Brilliance!

564
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:31,576
l will show you what that is!

565
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,548
Dude, once the science fair is
over, Anumol will come behind me.

566
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:40,190
Too woo her,

567
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:42,186
l'll use this brain of
mine to the fullest!

568
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,888
- This brain?
-Any doubt?

569
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:47,027
She will come behind
me like this!

570
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:50,032
- When she sees you, her..
- Her?.

571
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:52,190
level goes down.

572
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:53,429
Level? What level?

573
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:55,597
Level of testosterone!

574
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,134
Test..et.. What?

575
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:58,642
Testosterone,

576
00:42:58,642 --> 00:42:59,609
Dopamine,

577
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:00,968
Phenylethylamine,

578
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:02,045
Oxytocin,

579
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:03,146
Pheromones,

580
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:05,309
Only when all of these
go to the brain,

581
00:43:05,482 --> 00:43:06,650
'that' will happen!

582
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:07,617
What?

583
00:43:08,652 --> 00:43:09,619
Love!

584
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:12,045
When you see the
person you love,

585
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:13,447
your lips will shiver,

586
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:15,286
your body will sweat,

587
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:16,927
True!

588
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:18,554
Even l sweat when l see her!

589
00:43:19,196 --> 00:43:20,458
That must be some other disease!

590
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:23,531
Actually, what do you mean?

591
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:27,229
Even if you lay an egg,

592
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:29,064
you won't get her!

593
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:37,213
l will get her!

594
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:05,507
Hey! Wash your hands
before eating!

595
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:08,600
Aby!

596
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:10,637
Why? You haven't seen
him before this?

597
00:44:12,249 --> 00:44:13,614

Eat it & go!

601
00:44:20,124 --> 00:44:22,456
- lt's torn now!
- As if you don't tear it before eating!

602
00:44:25,562 --> 00:44:28,122
l enrolled for the science fair
hoping that you will help me!

603
00:44:28,432 --> 00:44:31,265
Since Haridas Sir also forced me
saying that you're my friend..

604
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:33,327
Anything is fine!

605
00:44:36,407 --> 00:44:37,533
l should win the first prize!

606
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:38,973
lt's a matter of my prestige.

607
00:44:40,244 --> 00:44:41,211

We were doing my project!

- What is this?
- Magical power station of America.

647
00:49:08,812 --> 00:49:09,779
This?

648
00:49:09,846 --> 00:49:11,279
What are you going
to do with this?

649
00:49:45,048 --> 00:49:46,015
What is this?

650
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:49,444
Magical power
station of America?

651
00:49:49,753 --> 00:49:51,550

Soap box battery & pen torch!

659
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,530
Then you could've brought
them alone, right?

660
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,967
Why did you have to fill it
with so much scrap waste?

661
00:50:08,872 --> 00:50:10,271
Take it & get lost!

couldn't discover my love for you,

l have no doubt
doubt in the fact

685
00:52:42,225 --> 00:52:46,997
that this revolutionary invention
would be a huge relief for

686
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:52,235
our mothers & sisters who have to walk
so many kilometres for a drop of water!

687
00:52:52,235 --> 00:52:55,762
l will make a recommendation to our Chief
Ministerto install this Water Wheel Tap

688
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:59,172
notjust in our constituency, but all
over Kerala.. no, all over lndia,

689
00:52:59,242 --> 00:53:03,736
as a business model!

690
00:53:05,782 --> 00:53:07,875
l will ensure that it won't
get stuck as an petition,

691
00:53:07,951 --> 00:53:10,511
and it will be executed on time!
You have my word!

692
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:12,651
But isn't he an MLA who
lost the elections?

693
00:53:13,089 --> 00:53:14,716
Shall l call Aby as well, Papa?

694
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:15,859
lf that happens,

695
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:16,826
Shut up!

696
00:53:20,597 --> 00:53:23,566
will be getting lakhs
of Rupees as a patent.

697
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:29,806

711
00:53:58,301 --> 00:54:00,604
lt was you & your daughter
who did all the nonsense!

712
00:54:00,604 --> 00:54:01,571
What did we do?

713
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:03,603
Sir, it was my son who
made the Water Wheel!

714
00:54:04,007 --> 00:54:05,702
There! There he is!
Aby!

715
00:54:05,775 --> 00:54:07,868
- Let this program get done, Baby.
- Papa, let's go!

716
00:54:07,978 --> 00:54:10,845
lf you try to fool him because he's
a special child, l will finish you!

717
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:12,040
What do you want?

718
00:54:12,148 --> 00:54:13,979
l want the money & the patent!

719
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:15,051
Get lost!

720
00:54:15,151 --> 00:54:17,244
- How dare you!
- Don't create a scene!

721
00:54:17,554 --> 00:54:19,112
Who are you to ask
me to get lost!

722
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:20,723
No! Let's go, dad!

723
00:54:21,191 --> 00:54:22,792
Hey, you take the award!

724
00:54:22,792 --> 00:54:24,123
At least give the money to him!

725
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:25,686
Sit down!

726
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:26,729
Sir!

727
00:54:27,163 --> 00:54:29,256
This problem won't be solved
unless we get the patent.

728
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:31,301
You don't know me well!

729
00:54:31,301 --> 00:54:33,599
lf they don't know me,
tell them who l am!

730
00:54:36,906 --> 00:54:38,608
This is a betrayal!
Grave betrayal!

731
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:40,075
Talking nonsense
because he's drunk!

732
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:42,005
- Catch him, Sir!

733
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:50,286
- You got enough patents now?
- Enough, Sir!

734
00:54:52,989 --> 00:54:55,048
- l've given him enough patents, Sir.
- Did you?

735
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:57,089
Then l'll give him
the cash award!

736
00:54:57,994 --> 00:54:58,957
You!!

737
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:03,096
Aren't you ashamed of
betraying your own friend?

738
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,963
But he's an imbecile, right?

739
00:55:09,005 --> 00:55:09,972
Come!

740
00:55:11,341 --> 00:55:12,308
Very nice!

741
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:19,906
Did you take everything?

742
00:55:32,896 --> 00:55:33,863
Give it to me!

743
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:39,669
Hereafter, if you or your father step
inside my property to get water,

744
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:41,136
l will chop your legs off!

745
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:42,305
Understood?

746
00:55:47,143 --> 00:55:48,110
Hey!

747
00:55:48,411 --> 00:55:49,378
Put it down!

748
00:55:57,287 --> 00:55:58,754
Or else, you can
take these ones.

749
00:56:07,764 --> 00:56:10,096
What are you looking at?
Start the car! - Yes!

750
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:20,109
Aby!

751
00:56:21,745 --> 00:56:45,001
Team DrC

752
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:48,704
She kissed him!

753
00:56:49,005 --> 00:56:49,972
Oh my God!

754
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:54,310
Are you talking nonsense
about your own sister

755
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:56,141
whom you've grown up with?

756
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,047
Sister?

757
00:57:00,183 --> 00:57:01,275
Let her romance!

758
00:57:01,785 --> 00:57:03,013
What's your problem?

759
00:57:03,186 --> 00:57:04,847
Even if you've seen it,

760
00:57:05,021 --> 00:57:07,080
How could of you think
of telling it to me?

761
00:57:07,724 --> 00:57:09,021
l'm herfather, right?

762
00:57:09,993 --> 00:57:10,960
Ya..

763
00:57:11,995 --> 00:57:15,021
lf you try to create troubles in
spite of growing up together,

764
00:57:15,165 --> 00:57:17,934
- you bloody Kunjoottan!
- Don't hit me! l'm going for pilgrimage!

765
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:18,901
To Sabarimala!

766
00:57:19,402 --> 00:57:20,369
l'm a Swami!

767
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,141
- Swami!
-Ayyappa!

768
00:57:25,141 --> 00:57:26,301
l mean, what is it?

769
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,035
Let her finish her studies.

770
00:57:28,144 --> 00:57:30,169
lf they like each other,
we can make it happen!

771
00:57:31,047 --> 00:57:33,174
You should be there
as her elder brother!

772
00:57:33,883 --> 00:57:34,850
You may go!

773
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:36,784
ls he a father?

774
00:57:38,388 --> 00:57:39,355
Scoundrel!

775
00:57:39,756 --> 00:57:40,757
What?

776
00:57:40,757 --> 00:57:41,724
Coconut!

777
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:43,019
- You want to break it here?
- No!

778
00:57:43,092 --> 00:57:44,059
Then go!

779
00:57:47,197 --> 00:57:48,164
ls it over?.

780
00:57:48,231 --> 00:57:49,198
Almost done!

781
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:50,459
- l said that to him!

782
00:57:54,237 --> 00:57:56,398
Oh Mother Mary, why did
you say that to him?

783
00:57:57,807 --> 00:57:58,967
What else could l do?

784
00:57:59,509 --> 00:58:01,443
l should've believed
him, gone to the school,

785
00:58:01,544 --> 00:58:04,080
taken our daughter
out, slapped her;

786
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,014
and let the whole world
know about it, or what?

787
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:10,742
Dear, it will be a problem only if she
thinks that we have taken it seriously.

788
00:58:10,887 --> 00:58:12,422
Now she will be totally confused.

789
00:58:12,422 --> 00:58:14,049
You & your wicked brain!

790
00:58:27,804 --> 00:58:28,771
Wait!

791
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:36,236
Did you kiss him?

792
00:58:36,312 --> 00:58:38,177
Sheesh! What are you asking her?.

793
00:58:38,915 --> 00:58:39,882
Yes!

794
00:58:40,283 --> 00:58:41,375
l gave him the money as well!

795
00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:44,053
Oh God!

796
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:54,326
Baby, listen to me!

797
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:55,397
Don't go there!

798
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:59,160
Baby, if you start a fight, you'll
get more patents from the police!

799
00:58:59,235 --> 00:59:00,395
You electricity thief!

800
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:02,105
You'll make the
police hit me, is it?

801
00:59:02,105 --> 00:59:03,072
Bloody dog!

802
00:59:03,172 --> 00:59:04,173
Listen to me!

803
00:59:04,173 --> 00:59:06,403
You'll never do well,
if you spoil my living!

804
00:59:06,476 --> 00:59:09,877
You! You spent all his
money without any shame!

805
00:59:10,179 --> 00:59:11,874
Bloody scientist!

806
00:59:12,982 --> 00:59:13,949
Stop!

807
00:59:14,017 --> 00:59:14,984
Leave me!

808
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:16,382
Both of you go inside.

809
00:59:16,452 --> 00:59:18,113
She has given that
money to your son!

810
00:59:18,187 --> 00:59:19,381
Go ask him if you want it!

811
00:59:22,926 --> 00:59:25,121
Try coming to fetch water
from this house again!

812
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:27,290
What will you do if he comes?

813
00:59:27,363 --> 00:59:28,887
Our daughter is here.
Keep quiet.

814
00:59:29,165 --> 00:59:30,333
Come!
Go inside!

815
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:31,300
Where is he?

816
00:59:31,935 --> 00:59:33,202
Where is my son?

817
00:59:33,202 --> 00:59:34,504
He is missing for the past 2 days.

818
00:59:34,504 --> 00:59:35,939
l was about to tell you.

819
00:59:35,939 --> 00:59:37,236
Hey! He knows where Aby is!

820
00:59:37,974 --> 00:59:39,441
He knows! He is Aby's aide!

821
00:59:39,509 --> 00:59:41,306
Stop!

822
00:59:42,211 --> 00:59:43,337
Where is Aby?
Tell me!

823
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:44,971
Aby is on top of the
Thonappara rock!

824
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:47,250
- He is making something big!
- Let him do what he wants!

825
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,085
Didn't you both spend
all the money he got?

826
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:50,052
Baby, wait!

827
00:59:50,186 --> 00:59:51,153
Oh God, my leg!

828
00:59:51,454 --> 00:59:52,978
Such a steep climb!

829
01:00:32,261 --> 01:00:34,030
We should split the
money between us!

830
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:36,498
lt should be worth climbing
all the way up here!

831
01:00:36,666 --> 01:00:37,633
Oh God!

832
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:39,127
Noah's arc!

833
01:00:41,237 --> 01:00:42,238
Look Aashan!

834
01:00:42,238 --> 01:00:43,603
Your entire workshop is here!

835
01:00:43,673 --> 01:00:45,436
- Oh God!
- There's the pilot!

836
01:00:45,508 --> 01:00:48,068
My entire workshop is
in your auto rickshaw!

837
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:50,237
His mom died because of his
bloody airplane craze!

838
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,472
l won't allow you to fly
anything as long as l'm alive!

839
01:00:53,549 --> 01:00:55,449
- Move, Baby!
- Get down, l say!

840
01:00:56,119 --> 01:00:57,120
Get down!

841
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:59,213
- Baby!
- Oh my God! My silencer!

842
01:01:01,124 --> 01:01:02,614
What are you doing, Baby?

843
01:01:03,026 --> 01:01:04,152
Leave me!

844
01:01:05,561 --> 01:01:07,290
How did you bring
all this up here?

845
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:09,430
l want to kill him!

846
01:01:10,433 --> 01:01:11,661
You bloody!

847
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:13,491
Baby, he will die!

848
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:16,263
- Baby, calm down!
- Let him die!

849
01:01:16,572 --> 01:01:18,005
He stole all 3 tyres of mine!

850
01:01:19,308 --> 01:01:21,003
What have you done, Aby?

851
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:22,702
Oh God, will this really fly?

852
01:01:23,413 --> 01:01:24,641
What?
Baby!

853
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,142
Don't do anything stupid!

854
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:28,217
Baby, no!

855
01:01:28,284 --> 01:01:29,376
Has he gone mad?

856
01:01:29,452 --> 01:01:30,419
Baby!

857
01:01:30,486 --> 01:01:32,545
Move!
Take him away, Bennykkutty!

858
01:01:32,622 --> 01:01:33,589
Catch him!

859
01:01:34,724 --> 01:01:35,691
Baby!

860
01:02:58,207 --> 01:03:40,873
Team DrC

861
01:04:01,304 --> 01:04:03,772
- Didn't l tell you earlier?
- Give me the balance, Sir.

862
01:04:06,309 --> 01:04:10,336
- Sir, ask him to pay the money.
- Don't worry. l'll settle that.

863
01:04:18,621 --> 01:04:20,486
Why do you want to pay the
police unnecessarily?

864
01:04:23,926 --> 01:04:25,689
Hello! No need of the taxi!
Cancel it!

865
01:04:27,163 --> 01:04:28,631
- Shriya was awesome, right?

866
01:04:28,631 --> 01:04:31,691
- Leave that! Our 'Thalaivar'
Rajnikanth was so stylish!

867
01:04:31,767 --> 01:04:35,203
- Which one? The song?
- (sings a song from Sivaji - The Boss)

868
01:04:35,638 --> 01:04:36,662
Hey! What did you do?

869
01:04:37,773 --> 01:04:39,536
- My phone isn't working!
- Hey! Who's that?

870
01:04:40,443 --> 01:04:41,876
- l don't know what happened!

871
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:43,345
Get up!

872
01:04:43,913 --> 01:04:44,880
Who are you?

873
01:04:47,783 --> 01:04:49,683
Who is this?
A thief or a madman?

874
01:04:49,785 --> 01:04:51,650
- Hey! Get up!
- Throw him out!

875
01:04:51,954 --> 01:04:52,921
Get out!

876
01:04:53,256 --> 01:04:54,223
Hold him!

877
01:04:56,626 --> 01:04:57,593
Get lost!

878
01:04:58,527 --> 01:05:01,223
We ourselves strive so hard for
food, and he wants a share of that?

879
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:02,797
- Correct!
- Hey Pattaas!

880
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:10,770
What are you staring at?
Get lost!

881
01:05:14,677 --> 01:05:16,304
Sir, that's a regular guy!

882
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:18,380
Stop!

883
01:05:18,547 --> 01:05:21,175
- Tell me your address!
- KR Tower!

884
01:05:30,626 --> 01:05:31,593
Blow it!

885
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:34,294
Not high octave!

886
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:35,397
Low octave!

887
01:05:37,733 --> 01:05:38,700
Phew!

888
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:44,930
'O' dear Krishna,
please come quickly'

889
01:05:45,308 --> 01:05:46,275
Hey! Hey!

890
01:05:46,342 --> 01:05:47,309
Stop there!

891
01:05:48,811 --> 01:05:49,778
Start the jeep!

892
01:05:50,546 --> 01:05:51,740
Get him into the jeep!

893
01:06:00,323 --> 01:06:01,290
VATT!

894
01:06:01,857 --> 01:06:03,381
VAT 69?

895
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:05,222
No! Plain 'Vaatt'!
(Locally brewed arrack)

896
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:06,261
Paddy?

897
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:08,695
- Fruits?
- No!

898
01:06:09,732 --> 01:06:10,699
Battery!

899
01:06:18,007 --> 01:06:18,974
Get inside!

900
01:06:19,475 --> 01:06:20,442
Get in!

901
01:06:24,714 --> 01:06:28,445
'l saw a dream yesterday'

902
01:06:28,884 --> 01:06:32,820
'The traffic police
came & caught me'

903
01:06:42,798 --> 01:06:45,892
Who is it singing a lullaby
when it's time to wake up?

904
01:06:48,704 --> 01:06:51,696
What's this, Pattaas? Why are you
playing songs in the morning itself?

905
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:56,078
- Hey, come!

906
01:06:56,078 --> 01:06:57,045
Hey Engineer!

907
01:06:58,514 --> 01:07:00,082
Your phone started
working again already?

908
01:07:00,082 --> 01:07:01,344
Did he repair it?

909
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:02,651
That's good!

910
01:07:03,085 --> 01:07:04,609
- Hey!
- Hey engineer!

911
01:07:20,069 --> 01:07:21,502
l got a call from UK.

912
01:07:22,805 --> 01:07:24,705
They are curious about our 'Sky Blue'.

913
01:07:25,107 --> 01:07:28,565
About our company which went
bankrupt and shut shop?

914
01:07:28,811 --> 01:07:30,369
That's not a problem forthem.

915
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:32,548
They are ready to take it over.

916
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:33,913
They will invest the entire amount.

917
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:36,514
But on certain conditions..

918
01:07:36,819 --> 01:07:40,016
They know that there's no one better than
you in light aircraft designing, GK.

919
01:07:40,423 --> 01:07:43,620
All they're asking is, your
expertise & creative support.

920
01:07:44,427 --> 01:07:45,917
To be cheated again?

921
01:07:46,662 --> 01:07:47,924
l don't want that again!

922
01:08:06,115 --> 01:08:08,948
(Tamil devotional song
plays on the radio)

923
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:26,735
Oh Lord Muruga!

924
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:34,936
- Has the boss come?

925
01:08:35,010 --> 01:08:36,102
- l had called him!

926
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:39,744
- Hey, boss is inside, right?
- Yes.

927
01:08:39,882 --> 01:08:41,110
Your phone is fixed?

928
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:46,651
Tell me clearly!
How?

929
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:50,592
We have an engineer with us!

930
01:08:50,726 --> 01:08:51,693
Engineer?.

931
01:08:51,861 --> 01:08:52,828
There he is!

932
01:08:53,863 --> 01:08:56,730
- You always keep asking for money!

933
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:58,934
- Not that, Sir!

934
01:08:59,668 --> 01:09:01,659
- We're asking for the old balance
amount.

935
01:09:01,737 --> 01:09:02,999
- No! l can't give any money now!

936
01:09:03,072 --> 01:09:04,471
- Give it, Sir.

937
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:10,476
- Oh Lord Vinayaka!
Lord Muruga!

938
01:09:10,613 --> 01:09:12,515
- Today we should do good business!

939
01:09:12,515 --> 01:09:13,709
Hey! Get in! They'll join you!

940
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:21,381
Team DrC

941
01:09:21,724 --> 01:09:22,850
l'll slap you!
Move!

942
01:09:26,695 --> 01:09:29,892
- We buy old newspapers,
bottles & magazines!

943
01:09:35,971 --> 01:09:39,498
'Our hands are not
empty, but full of gold'

944
01:09:39,575 --> 01:09:46,105
'The sky is our roof,
rags are our bed'

945
01:09:46,182 --> 01:09:51,210
'Hither and thither, wherever
l go, is a paradise'

946
01:09:54,623 --> 01:09:56,147
- Hey! Sit down! Let's go!

947
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:04,266
'Our hands are not
empty, but full of gold'

948
01:10:04,266 --> 01:10:10,967
'The sky is our roof,
rags are our bed'

949
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:16,068
'Hither and thither, wherever
l go, it's a paradise'

950
01:10:19,982 --> 01:10:22,678
lf you don't take a decision soon,
you'll have to surrender all this.

951
01:10:22,751 --> 01:10:25,811
You could survive for so long only
because that bank manager helped you.

952
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:28,079
lf you don't settle
your liabilities soon,

953
01:10:28,257 --> 01:10:30,157
the bank will take away
your house & property.

954
01:10:32,261 --> 01:10:33,228
Let them come!

955
01:10:33,862 --> 01:10:35,227
Let me see what happens.

956
01:10:37,566 --> 01:10:38,863
Hey!

957
01:10:38,968 --> 01:10:39,935
Engineer!

958
01:10:43,639 --> 01:10:44,765
Come here!
What's over there?

959
01:11:01,290 --> 01:11:02,917
Hey! Bring the stuff fast!

960
01:11:06,629 --> 01:11:07,596
Wow!

961
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:09,554
What a man!

962
01:11:09,898 --> 01:11:11,559
This is the effect
of military alcohol!

963
01:11:12,001 --> 01:11:16,131
Look at him jogging early in the
morning after drinking all night!

964
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:24,079
What?

965
01:11:33,689 --> 01:11:34,656
Hey!

966
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:41,997
Enough!

967
01:11:42,665 --> 01:11:44,565
- Hey Engineer!
Throw it!

968
01:11:46,935 --> 01:11:49,631
- What's he doing?
- Come fast! Catch it!

969
01:12:08,824 --> 01:12:10,587
Oh my God!

970
01:12:11,794 --> 01:12:12,920
Hey engineer!

971
01:12:32,715 --> 01:12:39,348
'We don't need a pocket when the
income & expense are the same!'

972
01:12:39,855 --> 01:12:42,983
'When we make more
money than usual,

973
01:12:43,058 --> 01:12:46,619
we get three meals on
that sumptuous day'

974
01:12:46,729 --> 01:12:53,726
'lf the pocket is empty,
someone starts humming inside the tummy'

975
01:12:53,802 --> 01:12:56,794
'The only solace being
the street tap'

976
01:12:56,872 --> 01:13:01,900
'Hither and thither, wherever
l go, it's a paradise'

977
01:13:04,279 --> 01:13:06,770
They are really impressed
with our presentation.

978
01:13:07,282 --> 01:13:09,375
- lnitially they'll pay 40 lakhs.
- Where's the bar?

979
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:13,419
GK, not now!
Wait for some time!

980
01:13:25,768 --> 01:13:32,799
'The one who's not lazy to slog it out,
will always be at the prime of his health'

981
01:13:33,041 --> 01:13:39,810
'lf he feels happy with the sun & rains,
no one would wish for a glass mansion'

982
01:13:39,915 --> 01:13:46,946
'We are the ones who should share the
burden this earth carries on its shoulders'

983
01:13:47,022 --> 01:13:50,014
'Ours are the hands that should
support the mother earth'

984
01:13:50,125 --> 01:13:55,153
'Hither and thither, wherever
l go, it's a paradise'

985
01:14:01,203 --> 01:14:04,807
'Our hands are not
empty, but full of gold'

986
01:14:04,807 --> 01:14:11,313
'The sky is our roof,
rags are our bed'

987
01:14:11,313 --> 01:14:16,444
'Hither and thither, wherever
l go, it's a paradise'

988
01:14:38,006 --> 01:14:40,133
So you want to fly?

989
01:14:40,442 --> 01:14:41,409
Yes!

990
01:14:44,379 --> 01:14:47,041
Before that, you will have
to do certain things.

991
01:15:12,608 --> 01:15:25,453
Team DrC

992
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:23,435
There's one more thing
that you'll have to do.

993
01:16:29,952 --> 01:16:30,919
What is it?

994
01:17:03,585 --> 01:17:05,109
How do birds fly?

995
01:17:40,088 --> 01:17:43,148
And, have you noticed
a bird's wings?

996
01:17:44,226 --> 01:17:46,626
lt will be curved in the front,

997
01:17:47,529 --> 01:17:49,622
shrunk towards the back,

998
01:17:50,298 --> 01:17:51,526
and the tips would be closer.

999
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:54,495
ln our engineers' lingo,

1000
01:17:54,569 --> 01:17:56,969
this shape is known
as 'Air Foil'.

1001
01:17:58,407 --> 01:18:00,705
When it cuts across
air, and goes forward,

1002
01:18:01,410 --> 01:18:04,208
the speed of the wind which flows
above the wing will increase.

1003
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:07,080
So the pressure over
there will decrease.

1004
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:10,413
When the speed of the wind that
flows beneath it decreases,

1005
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:12,146
the pressure upwards
would increase.

1006
01:18:13,455 --> 01:18:14,649
lt is this pressure,

1007
01:18:15,090 --> 01:18:16,148
or this lift,

1008
01:18:16,658 --> 01:18:18,250
which makes a bird fly!

1009
01:18:20,195 --> 01:18:21,719
Consumed by the desire to fly,

1010
01:18:21,997 --> 01:18:25,228
so many mad-men like you & me,

1011
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:27,559
tried tying wings to their hands,

1012
01:18:27,669 --> 01:18:29,432
and running by spreading a cloth;

1013
01:18:30,238 --> 01:18:33,571
and did so many other
experiments which failed!

1014
01:18:39,247 --> 01:18:41,408
lt was the result of their hard work;

1015
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:42,617
The Airplane!

1016
01:18:58,366 --> 01:18:59,333
GK!

1017
01:19:14,116 --> 01:19:15,378
That won't fly!

1018
01:19:16,518 --> 01:19:17,485
lt's dead!

1019
01:19:18,453 --> 01:19:19,477
Like my..

1020
01:19:29,531 --> 01:19:30,498
Sky Blue!

1021
01:19:31,466 --> 01:19:32,490
My Company!

1022
01:19:34,636 --> 01:19:35,660
Sky Blue!

Team DrC

1024
01:21:02,357 --> 01:21:03,324
He repaired it.

1025
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:07,654
Where there's a will,

1026
01:21:07,729 --> 01:21:08,696
there's a way!

1027
01:21:17,505 --> 01:21:20,804
l started with remote-controlled
toy flight designing.

1028
01:21:21,943 --> 01:21:23,604
The hobby of rich people!

1029
01:21:24,312 --> 01:21:25,472
Madness!

1030
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:27,645
Mostly Europeans!

1031
01:21:29,651 --> 01:21:33,212
Gradually, l progressed
to microlight aircrafts.

1032
01:21:34,289 --> 01:21:38,191
Mostly from North
America and Europe.

1033
01:21:39,294 --> 01:21:43,492
Member of the Royal
Aeronautical Society.

1034
01:21:44,299 --> 01:21:46,233
lt was only after the
company became profitable,

1035
01:21:46,301 --> 01:21:49,236
l understood the true colours
of the people who were with me.

1036
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:52,297
They got me perennially drunk,

1037
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:54,375
and started a new company.

1038
01:21:55,644 --> 01:21:56,611
l...

1039
01:22:01,650 --> 01:22:07,680
The 2.5 crores l borrowed from
Meera's Papa to start Sky Blue,

1040
01:22:07,956 --> 01:22:09,218
went kaput!

1041
01:22:16,231 --> 01:22:19,257
l became ashamed of myself
in front of everyone else!

1042
01:22:19,834 --> 01:22:22,860
l had only one shelterto run & hide;

1043
01:22:25,674 --> 01:22:27,904
This is my shelter!

1044
01:22:28,576 --> 01:22:29,804
This house is also pledged.

1045
01:22:30,478 --> 01:22:35,347
Hypothecated to..
Blah Blah Blah Blah Bank!

1046
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:41,382
Everything is lost!

1047
01:22:41,823 --> 01:22:43,848
l am a dead man!

1048
01:24:03,738 --> 01:24:04,898
- Hello!
- Javed!

1049
01:24:34,536 --> 01:24:35,503

01:31:58,479 --> 01:31:59,468
Let it go, dude!

1095
01:32:00,147 --> 01:32:01,512
Why do you take
everything to heart?

And you know him!

Aby, what have you done?

Get lost, you moron!

Little more to the right!

No!

1112
01:35:51,579 --> 01:35:52,568
l'm not married yet.

1113
01:36:10,531 --> 01:36:12,260
lf you have conjunctivitis,
don't remove it!

1114
01:36:12,366 --> 01:36:13,424
No, Sir.
lt's for style!

1115
01:36:14,268 --> 01:36:15,326
Make it fast.

1116
01:36:15,402 --> 01:36:17,233

- Okay!

1117
01:36:22,109 --> 01:36:23,076
Slowly!

1118
01:36:26,147 --> 01:36:27,171
- Hello!
- Ya! Tell me.

1119
01:36:27,281 --> 01:36:28,646
- Where are you?
- Tell me what it is!

1120
01:36:28,783 --> 01:36:30,114
- That boy is back!

1121
01:36:30,451 --> 01:36:31,383
Which boy?

1122
01:36:31,786 --> 01:36:32,753
-Aby!

1123
01:36:34,688 --> 01:36:37,350
- Shall l start cutting?
- Ya! Start with my throat!

1124
01:36:38,592 --> 01:36:39,559
Sir!

1125
01:36:40,094 --> 01:36:41,584
Sir, give my apron back!

1126
01:36:41,762 --> 01:36:43,525
- You devil!
- Oh my God! Ghost!

1127
01:36:45,699 --> 01:36:46,666
Start the car!

1128
01:36:49,770 --> 01:36:50,737
Where were you?

1129
01:36:51,272 --> 01:36:52,330
For the past 7 years.

1130
01:36:53,207 --> 01:36:54,731
Ah! When did you reach, Mr.
Flying Machine?

1131
01:36:56,210 --> 01:36:58,371
Did you even bother to find
out if l'm dead or alive?

1132
01:36:58,445 --> 01:37:02,074
Baby, each person in this world
lives to achieve their dreams!

1133
01:37:02,349 --> 01:37:03,816
What if his dream is to fly?

1134
01:37:04,285 --> 01:37:07,652
He's saying that he wandered around for 6-7
years forthat and learned about it!

1135
01:37:07,755 --> 01:37:08,722
Ya right!

1136
01:37:08,823 --> 01:37:11,525
As if making an airplane is as
easy as making a straw ball!

1137
01:37:11,525 --> 01:37:12,787
Whatever it maybe!

1138
01:37:12,860 --> 01:37:15,658
Or let him do whatever he wants!
You don't try stopping him!

1139
01:37:15,763 --> 01:37:17,355
- Baby,
- Father!

1140
01:37:17,431 --> 01:37:19,865
After wandering around for a long time,
some people will do well in life.

1141
01:37:20,134 --> 01:37:21,135
But he hasn't!

1142
01:37:21,135 --> 01:37:23,160
His bloody airplane craze!

1143
01:37:23,237 --> 01:37:24,204
Baby,

1144
01:37:24,271 --> 01:37:26,466
if he wants to live here,
he has to live obeying me.

1145
01:37:26,540 --> 01:37:28,309
Or else, l won't let
him enter this house!

1146
01:37:28,309 --> 01:37:29,401
How can you say that?

1147
01:37:30,911 --> 01:37:31,878
Aby, wait!

1148
01:37:32,379 --> 01:37:33,346
Don't go!

1149
01:37:33,781 --> 01:37:34,748
Stop there!

1150
01:37:35,316 --> 01:37:36,874
Hey you, l won't let you fly!

1151
01:37:37,451 --> 01:37:38,679
l want to see how you'll fly!

1152
01:37:39,486 --> 01:37:40,788
However much you fly,

1153
01:37:40,788 --> 01:37:43,256
you'll have to come down to
the land for a drop of water!

1154
01:37:44,892 --> 01:37:45,859
Give it to me!

1155
01:37:46,227 --> 01:37:48,218
What is this, Sir? You're
running away with my apron?

1156
01:37:48,395 --> 01:37:49,897
Take yourApril & May with you!

1157
01:37:49,897 --> 01:37:51,228
l have just one of these!

1158
01:37:53,701 --> 01:37:54,668
What was it?

1159
01:38:50,724 --> 01:38:52,624
Don't you need wings
to fly, brother?.

1160
01:38:54,395 --> 01:38:55,362
Yes.

1161
01:38:55,829 --> 01:38:56,796
Where is it?

1162
01:38:57,431 --> 01:38:58,591
l have to make it.

1163
01:38:59,733 --> 01:39:00,700
When?

1164
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:09,502
My child is hungry!
l'll die now!

1165
01:39:10,311 --> 01:39:11,573
- Kunjoottan!
- Yes!

1166
01:39:11,712 --> 01:39:13,543
Come here.
What are you doing?

1167
01:39:14,315 --> 01:39:15,282
lt's him, dear.

1168
01:39:15,549 --> 01:39:16,573
That Nivin Pauly!

1169
01:39:16,817 --> 01:39:18,552
Oh my God!
Nivin Pauly?

1170
01:39:18,552 --> 01:39:19,610
Attend the call, dear.

1171
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:21,278
- l'm going inside.
- Yes, please.

1172
01:39:21,889 --> 01:39:22,856
Dude!

1173
01:39:24,425 --> 01:39:25,653
Nivin Pauly, the film actor?

1174
01:39:25,926 --> 01:39:27,689
- You don't know that?
- l mean..

1175
01:39:27,828 --> 01:39:28,954
Was it him on the phone?

1176
01:39:29,330 --> 01:39:31,423
Yes. He is my husband's
close friend.

1177
01:39:31,732 --> 01:39:33,597
lf he doesn't pick up,
he keeps troubling him.

1178
01:39:34,735 --> 01:39:36,362
- 2 Mutton Biriyanis.
- Okay Madam.

1179
01:39:36,804 --> 01:39:38,396
Add some extra onions.

1180
01:39:39,573 --> 01:39:41,542
- You got my message, right?
- Yes!

1181
01:39:41,542 --> 01:39:42,668
l got the message.

1182
01:39:43,577 --> 01:39:45,602
- There are lot of tools & parts, huh?
- What?

1183
01:39:45,746 --> 01:39:47,270
l was talking on the phone.
Sorry.

1184
01:39:48,048 --> 01:39:49,606
Just show the message
to the shopkeeper.

1185
01:39:49,984 --> 01:39:51,542
ls it too much of a
trouble for you?

1186
01:39:51,618 --> 01:39:52,778
What are you saying?

1187
01:39:52,853 --> 01:39:53,911
- l didn't mean that..

1188
01:39:55,456 --> 01:39:57,390
The trouble is only when
you talk to me like this!

1189
01:39:57,925 --> 01:39:58,926
ls it?

1190
01:39:58,926 --> 01:40:00,060
You're all standing here?

1191
01:40:00,060 --> 01:40:02,463
Then buy 10kgs of rice and
5kgs of tapioca as well!

1192
01:40:02,463 --> 01:40:03,896
- Go! Or else, l'll make you fly!

1193
01:40:05,399 --> 01:40:07,333
- Have you heard of Bernaulli, Sir?.
- Who's that?

1194
01:40:07,401 --> 01:40:08,698
- Do you know anything at all, Sir?.

1195
01:40:08,769 --> 01:40:10,037
- You & your bloody questions!

1196
01:40:10,037 --> 01:40:13,529
My husband was coming back
on a train from Chennai.

1197
01:40:14,475 --> 01:40:16,466
When he saw him first, he
couldn't recognize him!

1198
01:40:17,845 --> 01:40:19,836
But after they started
talking & got acquainted,

1199
01:40:20,347 --> 01:40:23,373
they kept talking for the whole
night without any sleep!

1200
01:40:24,752 --> 01:40:26,049
When the train reached Aluva,

1201
01:40:26,954 --> 01:40:27,955
Here's some water!

1202
01:40:27,955 --> 01:40:31,891
Nivin Pauly took my husband's mobile,
added his number on to it, and left.

1203
01:40:32,426 --> 01:40:33,723
And my husband came back home!

1204
01:40:33,927 --> 01:40:35,554
These calls started thereafter.

1205
01:40:36,930 --> 01:40:37,897
What did he say?

1206
01:40:38,365 --> 01:40:39,696
He asked me when
your due date is.

1207
01:40:41,535 --> 01:40:42,661
That's what's called affection!

1208
01:40:42,736 --> 01:40:44,829
Mutton Biriyani for the unborn child?

1209
01:40:44,938 --> 01:40:46,340
Don't you want something, Sir?.

1210
01:40:46,340 --> 01:40:47,307
One tea.

1211
01:40:50,644 --> 01:40:52,703
When Sathi Aunty became
bedridden after an accident,

1212
01:40:53,113 --> 01:40:54,671
they got Kunjoottan
Chettan married.

1213
01:40:55,816 --> 01:40:57,716
But Sathi Aunty was the
one who had to suffer!

1214
01:40:58,419 --> 01:41:00,478
Kunjoottan Chettan is staying
in his wife's house now!

1215
01:41:02,456 --> 01:41:03,557
Whatever said & done,

1216
01:41:03,557 --> 01:41:06,082
Kunjoottan Chettan still has
a soft-spot for me!

1217
01:41:06,693 --> 01:41:08,058
He comes running
whenever l call him!

1218
01:41:08,562 --> 01:41:10,393
He will do anything for me.

1219
01:41:11,432 --> 01:41:13,567
Speak of the devil..

1220
01:41:13,567 --> 01:41:14,534
And here he is!

1221
01:41:14,701 --> 01:41:15,929
He will live for a hundred years!

1222
01:41:16,537 --> 01:41:18,630
-Anumol!
- Give it to me! - Hold this.

1223
01:41:19,106 --> 01:41:20,073
So heavy!

1224
01:41:20,707 --> 01:41:22,576
Phew! You're sweating so much!

1225
01:41:22,576 --> 01:41:24,635
lt's just because you asked me.
Or else..

1226
01:41:24,711 --> 01:41:25,803
Don't l know that?

1227
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:27,047
Some water!

1228
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:34,487
What's up bro?

1229
01:41:34,922 --> 01:41:35,889
Long time!

1230
01:41:36,123 --> 01:41:38,057
You've got the looks
of a pilot now!

1231
01:41:38,459 --> 01:41:48,858
Team DrC

01:42:00,547 --> 01:42:01,707
You will fly!

1240
01:42:03,617 --> 01:42:04,811
- Thanks.
- l don't want this.

1241
01:42:04,885 --> 01:42:05,852
Gosh!

1242
01:42:06,420 --> 01:42:07,546
What do we do now?

1243
01:42:07,921 --> 01:42:09,889
We have to get it exchanged,
for a different brand.

1244
01:42:09,957 --> 01:42:11,481
lts has to be
exchanged, it seems!

1245
01:42:11,592 --> 01:42:13,116
l will do it!
Definitely!

1246
01:42:13,660 --> 01:42:15,025
- Tomorrow is fine, right?
- No!

1247
01:42:15,996 --> 01:42:17,020
l want it today itself.

1248
01:42:17,097 --> 01:42:18,098
Ask your daddy!

1249
01:42:18,098 --> 01:42:19,766
l carried it all the
way up here and..

1250
01:42:19,766 --> 01:42:20,858
Please Kunjuttan Chettan!

1251
01:42:21,502 --> 01:42:23,493
Why not? l'll go &
get it right away!

1252
01:42:32,212 --> 01:42:34,874
Thank you Kunjoottan Chettan! l
hope it's not too much trouble.

1253
01:42:35,516 --> 01:42:36,574
There you go again!

1254
01:42:36,650 --> 01:42:38,117
l'll be upset if you
talk like this!

1255
01:42:47,661 --> 01:42:49,151
- l've sent a load there, Sir.
- Okay.

1256
01:42:54,635 --> 01:42:55,659
Beauty?

1257
01:42:55,736 --> 01:42:57,567
ls she going to act
in a film or what?

1258
01:42:58,705 --> 01:43:00,138
Leave all that, Kochappu!

1259
01:43:00,574 --> 01:43:02,906
Tell me if there are any
well-settled guys with a good job,

1260
01:43:02,976 --> 01:43:03,943
we'll see!

1261
01:43:05,579 --> 01:43:06,807
Then we can proceed!

1262
01:43:07,247 --> 01:43:08,805
Okay.
l'll call you later.

1263
01:43:08,916 --> 01:43:09,905
What is it, Sir?

1264
01:43:10,184 --> 01:43:11,811
A boy from Koratty.

1265
01:43:11,952 --> 01:43:12,976
He is into business.

1266
01:43:13,153 --> 01:43:15,088
Was thinking if he would
be suitable for Anumol.

1267
01:43:15,088 --> 01:43:16,453
That won't be necessary!

1268
01:43:16,557 --> 01:43:17,524
Why?

1269
01:43:17,691 --> 01:43:18,953
Look!
Anumol!

1270
01:43:19,726 --> 01:43:20,693
Start the car!

1271
01:43:22,763 --> 01:43:24,031
Start the car, you fool!

1272
01:43:24,031 --> 01:43:25,699
My hands & legs are
shivering, Sir!

1273
01:43:25,699 --> 01:43:28,167
Why are your hands & legs shivering
thinking about my daughter?.

1274
01:43:28,235 --> 01:43:29,668
l haven't filled my tank, Sir.

1275
01:43:29,736 --> 01:43:32,573
Phew! You're always
thinking of alcohol!

1276
01:43:32,573 --> 01:43:34,666
l was talking about
the diesel tank, Sir.

1277
01:43:40,714 --> 01:43:42,079
Sister Glory left it here.

1278
01:43:42,849 --> 01:43:43,816
lt's German.

1279
01:43:45,752 --> 01:43:46,946
Have a drink, Xavier!

1280
01:43:47,187 --> 01:43:48,245
Tell me the matter, Father.

1281
01:43:48,555 --> 01:43:50,691
Once we arrive at a solution
for this, l'll decide

1282
01:43:50,691 --> 01:43:52,659
whether l should drink
this or something else.

1283
01:43:53,560 --> 01:43:54,527
Xavier,

1284
01:43:54,761 --> 01:43:56,228
your daughter is not
a little child.

1285
01:43:56,630 --> 01:43:58,723
Whatever precautions we take,

1286
01:43:58,966 --> 01:44:01,161
whatever has to
happen will happen!

1287
01:44:11,144 --> 01:44:12,509
Your mom stays with you?

1288
01:44:12,613 --> 01:44:14,548
No. At our ancestral house.
She just came today.

1289
01:44:14,548 --> 01:44:17,108
- lt's difficult for herto walk!
- l don't have any such difficulty!

1290
01:44:17,751 --> 01:44:18,911
No problem at all!

1291
01:44:23,557 --> 01:44:24,524
Have it!

1292
01:44:31,632 --> 01:44:32,599
Give it to him.

1293
01:44:33,300 --> 01:44:34,528
l'll take it myself.

1294
01:44:38,105 --> 01:44:39,072
What is this?

1295
01:44:40,274 --> 01:44:41,605
Oh! lt's Horlicks?

1296
01:44:41,875 --> 01:44:42,842
Sugar?.

1297
01:44:43,310 --> 01:44:45,141
l don't have.
Papa is slightly diabetic.

1298
01:44:45,912 --> 01:44:47,714
l mean.. This doesn't
have sugar in it.

1299
01:44:47,714 --> 01:44:48,840
Oh God!

1300
01:44:48,915 --> 01:44:50,610
You didn't add sugar?
Sheesh!

1301
01:44:50,917 --> 01:44:51,941
Have the snacks!

1302
01:44:53,720 --> 01:44:54,982
She's our only daughter.

1303
01:44:55,055 --> 01:44:56,955
That's because you
weren't capable of more!

1304
01:45:02,296 --> 01:45:03,695
Okay then.
Shall we leave?

1305
01:45:03,797 --> 01:45:05,731
Hey Anu, bye!

1306
01:45:07,067 --> 01:45:09,729
Don't think about anything else!
Fix this right away!

1307
01:45:12,639 --> 01:45:13,606
OK.

1308
01:45:14,975 --> 01:45:15,942
Bye!

1309
01:45:16,043 --> 01:45:17,978
- Nice boy!
- See you!

1310
01:45:17,978 --> 01:45:20,242
l understood that when you were
talking to him for so long!

1311
01:45:20,314 --> 01:45:21,781
You had so much to say?

1312
01:45:21,848 --> 01:45:23,338
Shouldn't l tell him
everything beforehand?

1313
01:45:23,617 --> 01:45:24,675
Everything as in?

1314
01:45:24,785 --> 01:45:26,582
Did you talk about that fellow?

1315
01:45:26,787 --> 01:45:27,754
- Yes!
- Huh?

1316
01:45:28,388 --> 01:45:30,117
Oh God! There he goes again!

1317
01:45:39,166 --> 01:45:40,599
l'll show you what l can do!

1318
01:45:40,967 --> 01:45:41,934
Hey you!

1319
01:45:43,937 --> 01:45:45,632
You bloody son of a plane!

1320
01:45:49,376 --> 01:45:50,343
Hey!

1321
01:45:50,410 --> 01:45:53,607
Use these pipes & screw-drivers
to the con the townsmen!

1322
01:45:53,714 --> 01:45:55,375
lf you try to mess
with my family,

1323
01:45:55,716 --> 01:45:56,910
l'll pull your screw out!

1324
01:45:58,051 --> 01:45:59,211
Why are you silent?

1325
01:46:03,390 --> 01:46:05,950
Listen! Don't try to hit
on my daughter anymore!

1326
01:46:06,126 --> 01:46:07,093
lf you do that,

1327
01:46:07,894 --> 01:46:09,225
l'm not like your dad,

1328
01:46:09,296 --> 01:46:11,398
l'll torch this whole damn
thing up along with you!

1329
01:46:11,398 --> 01:46:13,958
Got it? You bloody b@$#ard!

1330
01:46:16,069 --> 01:46:17,229
Switch off the fan!

1331
01:46:17,938 --> 01:46:19,235
My 'Mundu' is gone!

1332
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:21,234
My 'Mundu' is gone!

1333
01:46:22,743 --> 01:46:23,903
Wait & watch!

1334
01:47:21,802 --> 01:47:24,202
- From an initial fascination,

1335
01:47:24,337 --> 01:47:27,306
- Thonekkunnu has become an
entire town's focal point!

1336
01:47:27,941 --> 01:47:31,077
- We're witnessing the dream
of this young man called Aby

1337
01:47:31,077 --> 01:47:33,875
turning into the dream
of the entire town!

1338
01:47:34,448 --> 01:47:37,474
When the plane goes
through outer space,

1339
01:47:37,818 --> 01:47:40,053
how do the people
inside it breathe?

1340
01:47:40,053 --> 01:47:42,112
They will adjust with
whateverthey have inside it.

1341
01:47:42,189 --> 01:47:44,180
You can't do it! You have a
breathing problem, right?

1342
01:47:44,291 --> 01:47:46,384
Brother, which is the
way to Thonekkunnu?

1343
01:47:46,493 --> 01:47:50,190
Make this turning, turn
left and go straight for 1 .5 kms.

1344
01:47:50,764 --> 01:47:51,753
Thank you, brother!

1345
01:47:52,766 --> 01:47:56,258
-An entire village
is praying for Aby.

1346
01:47:56,336 --> 01:47:58,004
Everyone is going to Thonekkunnu.

1347
01:47:58,004 --> 01:48:00,802
Brother, where's the Aby Hill?
Where he's making the plane..

1348
01:48:00,907 --> 01:48:04,035
Make this turn, then turn left and
go straight for 1 .5 kms. Go fast!

1349
01:48:06,146 --> 01:48:07,807
All these people will not let me..

1350
01:48:09,249 --> 01:48:11,251
- What?
- Can this scooter go up to Thonekkunnu?

1351
01:48:11,251 --> 01:48:12,218
Of course!

1352
01:48:12,285 --> 01:48:13,843
- What's such a big deal over there?

1353
01:48:13,954 --> 01:48:16,388
Already some 60 people have
gone there since morning!

1354
01:48:16,556 --> 01:48:18,956
They won't even let me
do business in peace!

1355
01:48:19,025 --> 01:48:21,016
- Friend!
- What?

1356
01:48:21,127 --> 01:48:22,321
Aby's...

1357
01:48:22,429 --> 01:48:24,795
Just go straight.
1 .5 kms.

1358
01:48:25,131 --> 01:48:26,257
Okay. Thanks.

1359
01:48:27,234 --> 01:48:28,201
Brother!

1360
01:48:30,904 --> 01:48:33,099
Thonekkunnu. Aby Plane
Workshop - 1.5 km

1361
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:35,171
Okay brother!
Thanks!

1362
01:48:39,212 --> 01:48:42,282
Why has he kept it
on top of the hill?

1363
01:48:42,282 --> 01:48:44,113
Because the hill is not
too farfrom the sky!

1364
01:48:46,219 --> 01:48:47,186
Baby is here!

1365
01:48:47,554 --> 01:48:49,419
Are you coming back
after seeing the plane?

1366
01:48:50,423 --> 01:48:51,390
Ya right!

1367
01:48:51,591 --> 01:48:53,786
Come, Baby! lsn't this
a happy occasion?

1368
01:48:54,060 --> 01:48:55,186
You carry on!

1369
01:48:56,196 --> 01:48:58,164
- Why did you have to call him, Father?
- Come!

1370
01:48:58,231 --> 01:49:00,893
The plane flies through the sky
and not through the road, right?

1371
01:49:01,167 --> 01:49:02,134
- Stop!

1372
01:49:02,202 --> 01:49:04,329
- ls it too far from here, brother?
- What?

1373
01:49:04,437 --> 01:49:06,029
So you aren't coming from there?

1374
01:49:06,172 --> 01:49:07,139
Let's go!

1375
01:49:18,351 --> 01:49:31,628
Team DrC

1376
01:49:54,087 --> 01:49:55,088
Aby, look!

1377
01:49:55,088 --> 01:49:56,089
Come!

1378
01:49:56,089 --> 01:49:57,556
TV Channels!
lnterview!

1379
01:49:58,091 --> 01:49:59,058
Get up!

1380
01:49:59,225 --> 01:50:01,094
Move a little!

1381
01:50:01,094 --> 01:50:03,229
As there are only
a few days left ,

1382
01:50:03,229 --> 01:50:06,392
for your childhood dream
to turn into a reality,

1383
01:50:06,466 --> 01:50:08,127
what do you want to
tell the world, Aby?

1384
01:50:08,234 --> 01:50:10,327
l have notjust one,
but two desires.

1385
01:50:11,338 --> 01:50:12,305
One.

1386
01:50:13,173 --> 01:50:14,140
l want to fly!

1387
01:50:14,941 --> 01:50:16,135
- Second one..
- Second one?

1388
01:50:16,242 --> 01:50:18,301
Tell us, Aby!
What is your second desire?

1389
01:50:20,547 --> 01:50:21,536
l want to marry Anumol!

1390
01:50:23,383 --> 01:50:24,350
Oh my God!

1391
01:50:32,492 --> 01:50:34,153
Everyone, please make some way.

1392
01:50:38,665 --> 01:50:40,155
All the gentlemen are here?

1393
01:50:43,503 --> 01:50:45,027
ls he planning to fly it?

1394
01:50:45,405 --> 01:50:46,372
What else?

1395
01:50:46,439 --> 01:50:49,237
Why would anyone take so much
effort to keep it on ground like this?

1396
01:50:49,342 --> 01:50:52,277
Father, l had told you long back itself,
that it can't be flown so easily!

1397
01:50:52,545 --> 01:50:56,106
He needs permission! From the Civil
Aviation Department to the Local Panchayat.

1398
01:50:56,416 --> 01:50:58,952
And then KSEB, security
forces and many more.

1399
01:50:58,952 --> 01:51:00,920
Even if he gets permission
from all these places,

1400
01:51:00,987 --> 01:51:03,114
he'll have to pay Rs.1 lakh as
security deposit in DGCA.

1401
01:51:03,189 --> 01:51:05,453
Without any of these, how can
he fly itjust like that?

1402
01:51:08,228 --> 01:51:09,354
What is this?
An insect?

1403
01:51:16,269 --> 01:51:17,531
Hey kiddo!
Get down!

1404
01:51:19,739 --> 01:51:21,468
Can't you hear me?
Get down l say!

1405
01:51:22,275 --> 01:51:23,469
Father, what are they doing?

1406
01:51:24,644 --> 01:51:26,134
l'm telling this to everyone!

1407
01:51:26,246 --> 01:51:28,682
lt'll take a long time for this to fly!
All of you, please leave!

1408
01:51:28,682 --> 01:51:30,149
- Move!
- Go, l say!

1409
01:51:30,583 --> 01:51:32,073
Father, come here.
And you too, Sir.

1410
01:51:32,218 --> 01:51:34,015
Sheesh! This is atrocious!

1411
01:51:40,326 --> 01:51:42,228
You believed that boy and..

1412
01:51:42,228 --> 01:51:43,718
How do you know if it will fly?

1413
01:51:45,632 --> 01:51:50,160
My dear Sir, forthis, some really
efficient pilots or engineers,

1414
01:51:50,236 --> 01:51:53,034
who have a Civil Aviation
License, should come.

1415
01:51:53,139 --> 01:51:55,266
And then they have to approve
that this is all right.

1416
01:51:55,408 --> 01:51:56,705
Then you have to get permission.

1417
01:51:56,776 --> 01:51:58,300
Without any of these..

1418
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:01,570
Suppose you've got
the permission;

1419
01:52:01,681 --> 01:52:05,208
What if he flies it and dumps it
on top of a house or inside the dam?

1420
01:52:05,285 --> 01:52:06,718
lt will become my
responsibility then!

1421
01:52:08,488 --> 01:52:09,546
Breaking the law;

1422
01:52:09,789 --> 01:52:11,620
deliberate intention
to kill people;

1423
01:52:11,791 --> 01:52:13,418
there are many such sections!

1424
01:52:15,228 --> 01:52:18,493
My dear Father, make him understand
the gravity of this situation.

1425
01:52:22,302 --> 01:52:24,031
What is wrong with him?

1426
01:52:25,638 --> 01:52:27,333
What are you living for?

1427
01:52:28,508 --> 01:52:29,475
- Me?
- Yes!

1428
01:52:29,809 --> 01:52:31,242
For me and my family!

1429
01:52:32,278 --> 01:52:34,212
But he is living to fly!

1430
01:52:36,116 --> 01:52:38,141
lf we have all these
documents, he can fly, right?

1431
01:52:40,220 --> 01:52:41,187
You can fly!

1432
01:52:43,590 --> 01:52:44,557
Okay then.

1433
01:52:45,792 --> 01:52:47,225
But these documents are required!

1434
01:52:47,594 --> 01:52:48,561
Okay!

1435
01:52:50,630 --> 01:52:52,398
lt's paining!
Oh my God!

1436
01:52:52,398 --> 01:52:53,660
l've got muscle cramps!

1437
01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:56,061
l can't bear it!

1438
01:52:56,202 --> 01:52:58,271
l went to the gym for 4-5 years.
And see this?

1439
01:52:58,271 --> 01:52:59,238
No use!

1440
01:52:59,305 --> 01:53:02,240
Get some tough muscles, l say!

1441
01:53:02,542 --> 01:53:03,509
Oh my God!

1442
01:53:05,512 --> 01:53:06,774
Hey!
lt's Nivin!

1443
01:53:13,253 --> 01:53:14,254
Phew!

1444
01:53:14,254 --> 01:53:16,449
l had such a hard time
trying to convince her!

1445
01:53:17,223 --> 01:53:20,215
l got out saying that l have to get
some ready-made clothes for our shop.

1446
01:53:20,593 --> 01:53:21,560
We'll buy some!

1447
01:53:21,628 --> 01:53:23,391
There you can get clothes
in latest fashion!

1448
01:53:23,463 --> 01:53:24,589
Fashion! Ya right!

1449
01:53:25,098 --> 01:53:27,498
lf she knows this,
she will poison me!

1450
01:55:01,494 --> 01:55:02,791
Kurti from Pantaloons;

1451
01:55:03,897 --> 01:55:05,888
Where is it?
Ya! See this!

1452
01:55:06,699 --> 01:55:08,929
This is Gorilla!
l mean, Kangaroo from 'W'.

1453
01:55:09,435 --> 01:55:11,403
You'll get all this
at Shopper's Stop.

1454
01:55:11,738 --> 01:55:13,865
And there's one more item..

1455
01:55:14,274 --> 01:55:15,468
Here it is!
Look!

1456
01:55:15,575 --> 01:55:16,633
These are tunics!

1457
01:55:16,843 --> 01:55:18,242
You didn't like it?

1458
01:55:21,281 --> 01:55:22,682
Who is it?
What do you want?

1459
01:55:22,682 --> 01:55:24,650
Why did you go to Bangalore?

1460
01:55:24,717 --> 01:55:25,684
For this!

1461
01:55:27,253 --> 01:55:29,722
Why did you go to Bangalore
with my daughter?.

1462
01:55:29,722 --> 01:55:32,782
How could l send her all alone?
lt was just a favour. What's wrong with it?

1463
01:55:33,693 --> 01:55:35,795
You bloody b@$#ard! lf
you try to mess with me,

1464
01:55:35,795 --> 01:55:36,762
What did l do?

1465
01:55:36,896 --> 01:55:39,732
Even though l've been trying to hit
on your daughter for 10-20 years,

1466
01:55:39,732 --> 01:55:41,634
l haven't got even a
handshake from her yet.

1467
01:55:41,634 --> 01:55:43,534
Then what the hell do
you think l have done?

1468
01:55:43,970 --> 01:55:45,528
You know how depressing it is?

1469
01:55:47,707 --> 01:55:48,674
Sheesh!

1470
01:55:51,577 --> 01:55:52,908
Anumol!

1471
01:55:53,947 --> 01:55:55,437
l mean..
Minimol!

1472
01:56:38,424 --> 01:56:39,721
The aircrafts that we make,

1473
01:56:40,059 --> 01:56:41,549
work purely based on mechanism.

1474
01:56:42,495 --> 01:56:44,486
But this one,
has his soul in it!

1475
01:56:57,377 --> 01:56:58,344
Who is it?

1476
01:56:58,945 --> 01:56:59,912
lt's me!

1477
01:57:06,919 --> 01:57:08,011
This is his money.

1478
01:57:10,323 --> 01:57:12,484
The money l made by using
him during his childhood.

1479
01:57:32,111 --> 01:57:33,373
'Aby is ready to fly high'

1480
01:57:35,548 --> 01:57:39,644
He didn't take a farmer's loan for 2 crores
and say that he can't pay it back, right?

1481
01:57:39,719 --> 01:57:41,812
ls it fair if you say that
the boy cannot fly something

1482
01:57:41,921 --> 01:57:43,650
which he made after years
of hard work?

1483
01:57:43,723 --> 01:57:45,525
What he's saying is true, Sir.

1484
01:57:45,525 --> 01:57:47,322
Please consider this
with all your heart.

1485
01:57:50,530 --> 01:58:05,844
Team DrC

1486
01:58:21,694 --> 01:58:23,559
Where were you up to
at the village office?

1487
01:58:25,865 --> 01:58:27,628
l went there to give an
application for Aby.

1488
01:58:27,967 --> 01:58:29,559
You & your bloody Aby!

1489
01:58:29,735 --> 01:58:30,895
l will kill you!

1490
01:58:37,610 --> 01:58:38,577
What's the matter?.

1491
01:58:46,586 --> 01:58:49,111
Mix some more of herjapang
gopang Horlicks & give her!

1492
01:59:15,448 --> 01:59:16,415
Hey,

1493
01:59:16,582 --> 01:59:17,549
Sir isn't here.

1494
01:59:17,750 --> 01:59:18,774
You may go & come later.

1495
01:59:30,663 --> 01:59:31,891
We've got all the other papers.

1496
01:59:32,498 --> 01:59:34,022
The only one left is from KSEB.

1497
01:59:34,934 --> 01:59:36,102
lf we get that as well,

1498
01:59:36,102 --> 01:59:38,969
they're saying that we can go ahead
with the proceedings for you to fly.

1499
01:59:41,607 --> 01:59:43,009
lt's actually a very simple matter.

1500
01:59:43,009 --> 01:59:44,909
But yourfather should
show some mercy.

1501
01:59:44,977 --> 01:59:46,808
As if he's waiting for us!

1502
01:59:49,549 --> 01:59:51,117
l'm afraid if he would
do something drastic,

1503
01:59:51,117 --> 01:59:52,641
if he's not able to fly!

1504
01:59:52,952 --> 01:59:54,510
Keep quiet, Father!

1505
02:00:09,969 --> 02:00:10,936
Papa!

1506
02:00:13,105 --> 02:00:16,006
l know you're doing all this
because of your love for me.

1507
02:00:18,144 --> 02:00:19,839
What l have for Aby is also love.

1508
02:00:20,947 --> 02:00:23,916
But l know that he loves
flying more than me.

1509
02:00:26,118 --> 02:00:27,253
lf he doesn't fly,

1510
02:00:27,253 --> 02:00:28,845
he wouldn't be there
amongst us, Papa!

1511
02:00:30,957 --> 02:00:32,584
l'll obey whatever you say, Papa.

1512
02:00:35,895 --> 02:00:37,123
l'll marry whoever
you want me to.

1513
02:00:39,298 --> 02:00:40,731
lt's okay even if l fail.

1514
02:00:42,602 --> 02:00:43,694
Let him fly, Papa!

1515
02:00:51,611 --> 02:00:52,873
lt's working!

1516
02:00:56,249 --> 02:00:59,810
This village's homegrown pilot Aby, is
getting ready for his first experiment.

1517
02:01:00,019 --> 02:01:02,988
For Aby, who was born with wings,
this would be just a rehearsal.

1518
02:01:03,089 --> 02:01:05,891
Only if shows a satisfactory
performance in this flying,

1519
02:01:05,891 --> 02:01:08,086
he will be able to get a
license to fly alone.

1520
02:01:15,701 --> 02:01:17,669
Look! Our Aby is going to fly!

1521
02:01:26,112 --> 02:01:27,313
Where are you?
You reached?

1522
02:01:27,313 --> 02:01:28,678
l've reached the main junction!

1523
02:01:28,781 --> 02:01:29,839
How do l come from here?

1524
02:01:30,783 --> 02:01:31,750
Engineer!

1525
02:01:35,888 --> 02:01:36,855
Okay!

1526
02:01:41,594 --> 02:01:44,196
- So you've made an airplane on your own..
- This isn't an airplane.

1527
02:01:44,196 --> 02:01:45,322
lt's a powered hang-glider.

1528
02:01:45,898 --> 02:01:47,160
Anyone can make this.

1529
02:01:48,167 --> 02:01:49,293
l will make an airplane!

1530
02:01:50,636 --> 02:01:51,603
Later!

1531
02:01:53,806 --> 02:01:55,774
As the uncertainties
have cleared,

1532
02:01:55,908 --> 02:01:58,103
Mariyapuram village's
own pilot Aby,

1533
02:01:58,177 --> 02:02:01,613
is getting ready for his
first flying trial.

1534
02:02:01,681 --> 02:02:04,616
under the supervision of
aircraft designer GK Menon.

1535
02:02:04,817 --> 02:02:09,220
- Anyway, let us wait & watch how this
trailer is, before we watch the film!

1536
02:02:09,322 --> 02:02:13,281
- Linju Gopakumar for Mindvision,
with cameraman Biju Basil.

1537
02:02:23,402 --> 02:02:24,767
Slowly!
Slowly!

1538
02:02:45,291 --> 02:02:47,885
Everything is ready here
forthe flying trial.

1539
02:02:48,027 --> 02:02:50,291
No other problems.
Everything is okay! Over!

1540
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:56,092
Watch where you're going!

1541
02:02:56,936 --> 02:02:58,096
-Am l late?
- No!

1542
02:02:58,270 --> 02:02:59,703
He's going to fly, right?

1543
02:03:01,273 --> 02:03:03,002
- Who is he?
- l..

1544
02:03:03,209 --> 02:03:04,176
One second.

1545
02:03:24,730 --> 02:03:26,163
Sir, just a second!

1546
02:03:36,175 --> 02:03:37,369
They have started flying, Sir.

1547
02:03:40,913 --> 02:03:41,880
But..

1548
02:03:47,720 --> 02:03:48,687
Stop it!

1549
02:03:56,028 --> 02:03:58,931
There are some proceedings to be
cleared for security reasons.

1550
02:03:58,931 --> 02:04:00,865
lt's the Collector's order.
Please co-operate!

1551
02:04:01,200 --> 02:04:04,192
All the papers were cleared!
What are the new proceedings?

1552
02:04:04,470 --> 02:04:05,437
Move away!

1553
02:04:07,473 --> 02:04:08,997
ls he a mental case?

1554
02:04:13,979 --> 02:04:15,276
Get down, you...

1555
02:04:16,215 --> 02:04:26,284
Team DrC

1556
02:04:26,826 --> 02:04:28,851
A letter has gone to
DGCA's central office,

1557
02:04:28,928 --> 02:04:31,863
saying that his mental fitness documents
should be evaluated once again!

1558
02:04:31,931 --> 02:04:32,898
From where?

1559
02:04:32,965 --> 02:04:34,432
From a local address.
KESB, l think.

1560
02:04:34,934 --> 02:04:35,901
KSEB?

1561
02:04:36,135 --> 02:04:38,000
You can fly after
clearing all that!

1562
02:04:40,840 --> 02:04:43,274
Father, didn't l warn you that
this'll be a headache for us?

1563
02:04:44,977 --> 02:04:46,274
l sent it long back.

1564
02:04:47,046 --> 02:04:48,445
lt was a complaint
l gave long back.

1565
02:04:48,848 --> 02:04:50,247
But l would never..

1566
02:04:50,449 --> 02:04:52,474
- Hey Xavier!
- What is this?

1567
02:04:52,952 --> 02:04:54,317
l also want him to fly!

1568
02:04:54,954 --> 02:04:55,921
Believe me!

1569
02:04:58,858 --> 02:04:59,882
Baby, leave him!

1570
02:05:08,334 --> 02:05:09,301
Stop it!

1571
02:05:09,502 --> 02:05:11,367
lf you mess around, no one
will leave from here!

1572
02:05:13,205 --> 02:05:14,172
No way, Sir!

1573
02:05:14,573 --> 02:05:16,268
lf he's from Mariyapuram,

1574
02:05:16,375 --> 02:05:18,002
if he was born in this village,

1575
02:05:18,077 --> 02:05:20,045
we will make him fly today, Sir!

1576
02:05:28,153 --> 02:05:30,417
lt's his long time desire, Sir!

1577
02:05:30,856 --> 02:05:33,848
He will fly, Sir!
We will make him fly!

1578
02:07:04,216 --> 02:07:06,081
Maintain the same level!

1579
02:07:14,660 --> 02:07:16,491
Maintain the level!
Shift to the right!

1580
02:08:18,490 --> 02:08:19,684
l am his friend.

1581
02:08:21,493 --> 02:08:23,154
We've been friends since childhood!

1582
02:08:27,466 --> 02:08:28,433
What is it, Sir?

1583
02:08:29,001 --> 02:08:30,229
Do you feel like flying?

1584
02:09:50,449 --> 02:09:51,643
The thrill of flying,

1585
02:09:53,252 --> 02:09:54,810
lf you experience it once;

1586
02:09:56,088 --> 02:09:57,419
even if your legs
are on the ground;

1587
02:09:58,757 --> 02:10:00,452
your eyes would always
look up to the sky!
