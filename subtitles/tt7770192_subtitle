1
00:00:05,353 --> 00:00:07,147
Alcohol and cigarettes are deadly pal!

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,860
What does that mean Krishna?
- It means people will die if they consume them.

3
00:00:10,884 --> 00:00:29,884
Subtittle By 
 SupunWe 


4
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,970
Your package is ready.
It will reach you in max 15 to 20 days.

5
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:47,150
Keep the money ready.

6
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,080
Okay, Bye.

7
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,290
Oh no... President sir did you see this?

8
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:27,330
What is this? Birds are spoiling the crop.

9
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,120
Where is Krishna go?

10
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,370
Hey, leg brake is giving trouble

11
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:47,930
engage the hand brake

12
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:48,750
Ok dude

13
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:10,470
"I hope everything is
fine with you Anjaneya?"

14
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:37,790
"Is Yayathi who in your
shelter fearing death.."

15
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:40,250
How many ever times you say dude,
it was Paruchuri brothers who wrote that

16
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You dirty faced rascal.

17
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:45,830
I will hit you with slipper
if you say that again

18
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,420
It was written by Rajamouli's
father Vijayendra Prasad.

19
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:49,580
Do we bet on it dude?

20
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,260
It's a bet dude.

21
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,100
Fix, let's go.. Go.

22
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:52,850
Hey!

23
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,100
What Krishna? I asked you to come for seeding
and you came at the time of harvesting?

24
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,050
What is this delay?

25
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,140
Am I the gate keeper to come early?

26
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,430
I am King of Dwaraka, Lord Krishna

27
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:02,800
I should come late

28
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,010
Ok but we had been into
a discussion all the way

29
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,550
You settle it as an elder between us

30
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,930
First listen to me dude..

31
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:09,550
What would you say and we listen, idiot?

32
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,680
First clear our doubt

33
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,180
Say, what is that?

34
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:13,300
Nothing dude

35
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:14,100
Mahabharata

36
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:15,300
we have Mahabharata right?

37
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,470
This scholar says
Paruchuri brothers wrote it

38
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,300
and a greatest scholar that I am have
bet that Vijayendra Prasad wrote it

39
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,890
Tell me who is correct?

40
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,300
Being in the getups of Krishna and Balarama

41
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:27,260
it is a dreaded sin not
knowing who wrote Mahabharata

42
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,890
Vyasa has written that

43
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,260
Your face will swell if you lie
saying Vyasa and so on, idiot

44
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,760
He is feeling jealous about our knowledge,
dude

45
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,100
Hey dude

46
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,050
Yes
- Hi!

47
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,350
How did I draw?

48
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:44,800
Sri Krishna Leelalu licking

49
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,510
Hey rascal, it is not licking but a play

50
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,350
Are you kidding me?

51
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,800
I have been drawing this from the morning

52
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,390
Why didn't you say this earlier?

53
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,470
you irresponsible fellow.

54
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,110
Dude ...

55
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,800
Listen to this poem and say how it is

56
00:04:58,890 --> 00:04:59,510
Ok, sing

57
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:03,180
(Sanskrit poem)

58
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:04,680
What dude

59
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,470
Do you have sister in this drama.

60
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,970
Idiot...I am not saying about sister

61
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,680
I will take away the sarees
of babes singing this poem

62
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,720
What taking away

63
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,680
all the girls are angry on you

64
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,600
Why, for coming late?

65
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,850
Because you came

66
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,010
Yes

67
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,260
They are saying that, it is better to put
the hand in a juicer than to act with you

68
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,850
Where are the babes?

69
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,220
No one talk to him.

70
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,510
What baby

71
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,140
Hey womanizer, we fell into your clutches

72
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:38,180
It seems you are overacting instead
of singing the song? Come on let's go

73
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,430
Where to come?

74
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,600
After listening to the entire Ramayana, a
lazy idiot like you asked who Dharmaraj is..

75
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,160
Where is Dharamaraj in Ramayana dude?

76
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:45,860
Ahh!

77
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:49,650
He would be there, after hitting
so strongly not only Dharmaraj but,

78
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,940
There would also be Rebel Star Krishnam Raju
and editor Gautham Raju too in Ramayana.

79
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:52,510
That's right

80
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,850
I mugged up all the poems working
hard over night for you, baby

81
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,550
Now shall I sing all of them while
bathing if we do not play this drama?

82
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,640
You sing wherever you wish to

83
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:03,180
We can even do the play with this dark fellow
who mends tire punctures but not with you

84
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,140
Dude ...

85
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,100
I told you while putting on the makeup

86
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,970
Getup of Krishna would be
more apt for me than you?

87
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:09,550
Here, take this and give me that flute

88
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,720
I am telling you right away, listen to me

89
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,550
I will not take your sarees even
if you give them to me yourselves

90
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,120
Get lost girls.. come dude..

91
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,010
You go dude, I will take her number and come

92
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,060
Hey
- Yeah?

93
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:23,100
Crap!

94
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,050
(murmering)

95
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,760
Hey babe... what is this get up?

96
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,760
Can't you see..? get up of Sita

97
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,510
You are looking great in the dress dear

98
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:44,010
I... am... loving you...

99
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:44,550
Love..?

100
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:48,350
It is better to cut the neck and die
than let you tie the knot in the neck

101
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,350
What are those dangerous words girl?

102
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,720
Anyway what is there in you other
than that stubbornness and rigidity?

103
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,720
Why should anybody marry you?

104
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,850
Are there any properties behind you?

105
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:58,870
Do not talk rubbish girl!

106
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,940
Keep watching..
an Angel would come for me in a chariot

107
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:06,640
Yes, she will come. If that happens,
I will go around the village shaving my head

108
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:08,570
Why take risk girl?

109
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,560
we cannot bear seeing you with hair, if you
shave your head then dogs will be after you.

110
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:12,390
Careful

111
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,350
Dogs are better than you, go rascal

112
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,350
Get out idiot

113
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:20,850
Sarpanch called for a meeting under the
banyan tree as you were not at the fields

114
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,180
All are waiting there for you

115
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:27,450
ARJUN! ARJUN! ARJUN! ARJUN!

116
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,260
Alright, let us go ask someone here

117
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,180

119
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:39,260
I am so excited, I am dying to see Arjun

120
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:39,760
Wow!

121
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,930
Alright.. I have someone else also here

122
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,430
Hi. Hi.

00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,140

I am ready for one night
stand to go with him

126
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:51,970
Oh careful, your mom must be watching this

127
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:53,640
I love you Arjun!

128
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,930
It is my mom!

129
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,800
Did you just see that magic?

130
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,100
Arjun Jay prakash

131
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:05,350
the Indian originated rock star has
a huge fan following across the world

132
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,600
They are crazy about him

133
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,470
Best friend cum Manager of Arjun

134
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:12,390
Brahmaji is with us. Sir!

135
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,100
yes

136
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:17,550
If you are making so many wait for Arjun, you
look to have planned his entry very specially?

137
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,100
I would plan his entry or exit
only if I know where he is

138
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:20,850
Get out rascal?

139
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,260
Every fellow questions me

140
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,890
Don't know where he is..
I am dying with this fellow

141
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,080
What? This is breaking news!

142
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,640
We are waiting for him

143
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,010
You cheater!

144
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,600
I do not know what you do

145
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,550
Our concert should start in 5 minutes, ok

146
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,550
You understand?

147
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,550
Okay sir..
- Okay?

148
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,260
ENABLE LOCATION

149
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:35,930
Yeah tell me.

150
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,760
Get out you mad dog!

151
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,800
It is better to jump into a manhole
than to be as a manager for him

152
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:43,600
No idea which position he is in.

153
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,180
Arjun

154
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,510
Arjun

155
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,510
Arjun, all are waiting there

156
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:16,180
Late entry always gives a super
kick for all those who wait

157
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,100
Não se preocupe.

158
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,140
I am not a guest for this marriage
to go late, I am the bride

159
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,430
Okay, bye.

160
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:32,500
It's not about opening mouth..

161
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,320
You should have minimum common sense
to knock before opening the door

162
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:37,470
You come Jessi

163
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,260
You

164
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:43,300
Are you not understanding what I said?
She is feeling shy.

165
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,600
No, she is in fear.

166
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,330
Wat?

167
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:50,140
Why is she into fear seeing you?
You are after all a waiter.

168
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,350
He is not waiter.. but Peter

169
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,010
My fiance..

170
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:03,470
Hi bro

171
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,350
Congrats!

172
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,510
You know it is very difficult to get
a girl with a character like Jessi

173
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,510
Lucky fellow!

174
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:12,050
So sorry bro, I thought you
were a waiter seeing your outfit

175
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,010
Chill... chill bro

176
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:14,970
Actually I am a designer

177
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,470
Jessi asked me to set
her dress as it was tight

178
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,390
Actually... it is almost set

179
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,760
Is it okay?
- Ok, yeah..

180
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:24,760
It is okay now.

181
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:25,390
Hey!

182
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,390
You think I would believe it
if you say you are a designer?

183
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,510
You know what Sigmund Freud said?

184
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,220
You will not actually understand
if I tell you in such situations

185
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,020
Jessi.. it's time for me to leave

186
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,390
One question before I leave

187
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,640
You know why do they put
windows in houses and churches?

188
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,510
for wind to flow in

189
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,600
Wrong answer

190
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:01,970
Catch him

191
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,550
Go, go... Faster...

192
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,010

Turn this party up Turn the volume up

00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:39,050
Turn this party up Cuz
we like it loud in here

197
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:44,140
Turn this party up I said,
Turn the volume up

198
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,890
Make some noise If I can't hear you scream

199
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:49,470
Then y'all can get out of here

200
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:53,890
Who could walk a stage like this like this
Set the stage on fire like this like this

201
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:59,470
Say.. who could walk a stage like this like

I got a future that be brighter
than the flashiest lights

213
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:12,430
Your favourite rock star
is from the south zone

00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:17,680
Tara rara ratha lets go crazy

216
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,010
Arjun

217
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:35,010
Hey Nikki

218
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:35,760
What's up?

219
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:36,930
We just met yesterday night, right?

220
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:37,760
What again?

221
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,100
Did you remember me?

222
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,720
My family members have
fixed my marriage with a guy

223
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,510
They are forcing me to come to India

224
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,640
Talk to my parents about us,

225
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:48,970
Please Arjun!

226
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:50,720
No baby

227
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:54,680
There is more impact when we talk such
matters directly than on the phone

228
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,800
Do something.. You go to India immediately

229
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,850
I will be at your house the
next second you land there

230
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:04,930
I will be waiting
- Bye

231
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,600
What dude?

232
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,350
Are you getting married surprisingly?

233
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:14,680
Every club that we walk in Got
these bottles that we're popping

234
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:19,930
Every club that we walk in With that
rock star money straight balling

235
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:23,350
And the ladies staring,
trying to get my attention,

236
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:26,190
got to get their numbers We came to party,

237
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,060
We came to party..

238
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:58,390
Like a fish feels no cold,
our villagers have no sense at all

239
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,350
if not

240
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:02,600
When that idiot,
Krishna is dancing on our heads

241
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,890
how long do we bear?

242
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,970
When we work so hard and harvest crops

243
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,720
Like the food donation in tirupathi

244
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:09,510
He is donating seeds to birds!

245
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,140
He is roaming around
like a strengthened ram.

246
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:11,850
Let him come

247
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,680
I will break his feet and...

248
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:24,220
What Sarpanch, you called for a meeting
in the mid-day, don't you have any work?

249
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,050
We are doing our works properly..
but it's you...

250
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:29,430
You are roaming with your firends
around the village without work.

251
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,260
You aren't getting it into your
brain how many ever times we say

252
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,680
Girl! Go to your mom!

253
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:48,180
"I have caught the moonlight
and brought it for my Malli"

254
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:55,350
"Come on, let me see that"
- "Close your eyes, I will show everything"

255
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,600
"Come on, let me see that"
- "Close your eyes, I will show everything"

256
00:16:58,940 --> 00:16:59,520
Dude..
- Yeah.

257
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,680
Why do you think I alone can hear
Ilayaraja's music by seeing that girl?

258
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,430
Not just you, but everyone can hear it.
- Yes.

259
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,220
Marriage.. Okay?

260
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,550
It seems that the girl is new to the
village to have shown just the sandal.

261
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,760
Crap! Whatever we talk to you,
it is like the rain over a buffalo

262
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,050
I have been buying this kind
of things to bear your tensions

263
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,180
Why are you getting worked up over me

264
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,550
what have I done so wrong?

265
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:28,260
Hey!

266
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:31,430
When I believed you and made you to
guard the fields, do you abscond?

267
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,300
Your dad has defaulted payments to villagers

268
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,140
you are absconding from work

269
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,930
How to deal with you?

270
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,390
When only humans eat all crop,
what should the poor birds have?

271
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,800
Should they not live?

272
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,510
That is why, I gave them the freedom

273
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,430
Great freedom fighter has
come to fight for the birds,

274
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,430
Do you see Savitramma?

275
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,260
How is he talking when I put
him on job considering you?

276
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,890
I too have agreed to for
the job considering my mom

277
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:56,890
Hey Krishna

278
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:58,260
[All muttering]

279
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,180
I asked you to do a job, as you have
been into fights all over the village

280
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:02,720
There also you are fighting.
- Mom

281
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:03,970
Don't scold me always...

282
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:04,930
I have no mistake in this

283
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,550
Mistake is not yours but of your mom

284
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:09,140
Your mother doesn't have sense.

285
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:09,760
Hey Srinu

286
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,720
Does this Sarpanch have
any young grand daughter?

287
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,890
Not as far as I am aware

288
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:14,390
Sure.

289
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,390
Sure dude

290
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,890
Is it enough to sleep with
husband and give birth?

291
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,680
You should know how to bring up your son,
Savitramma

292
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:28,890
Hey old man.

293
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:30,640
Scold me whatever, I will bear

294
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,850
If you say anything to my mom...

295
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,800
I am already a crazy guy

296
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,640
I will beat you up badly not
even considering as a Sarpanch.

297
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,140
Mind it

298
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:53,140
Why are you so late...
instead of bringing it fast?

299
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:54,760
Where is Krishna?

300
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:55,550
저기있다!

301
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,890
You are super babe...

302
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:03,070
If Krishna is so excited, it means he is talking
to some girl. Has any girl gave him a green signal?

303
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,970
No signal nothing

304
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:08,050
It is tough for him to sleep without
listening to a lady voice right?

305
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:08,600
So?

306
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,800
He is speaking calling the customer care

307
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:15,300
Please say what you need
with some clarity sir

308
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,350
There is a girl named Uma
Maheswari in your office right?

309
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,300
Give the phone to her

310
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:24,300
She resigned the job as some guy named Krishna
is calling her up daily and is torturing sir

311
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,640
Hmm

312
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:27,470
OK

313
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,390
Tell me your personal phone number dear

314
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,300
Why sir?

315
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,050
What why

316
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,390
Should we not share our
our problems mutually?

317
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:34,720
Sorry sir

318
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:38,260
neither should you ask nor should
we say such personal matters

319
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,600
If you have any problems regarding recharge
network please say and we shall clear them

320
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,260
Am I any heroine from the daily
soap Chakravakam to have problems?

321
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,510
I do not have any of that sort

322
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,600
Tell me your phone number

323
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,390
Your's would be the first number
saved into Krishna's Phone

324
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,640
Krishna?

325
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:57,800
Thank you for calling customer care

326
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:00,640
How many stars would you like
to give for this conversation?

327
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:01,510
Look girl

328
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,260
I will give zero stars if you disconnect
the call now and it is up to you

329
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,510
Zero stars are far better than your nuisance,
bye

330
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,180
It's girls are modable dude

331
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:20,510
What does that mean Krishna?

332
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,050
It means girls are very stone hearted

333
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:24,910
Once we ask their phone number..

334
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,550
They show so much nastiness in their
face as if we asked for their properties

335
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:30,550
You don't worry as girls are
not falling for you Krishna

336
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:31,680
It's not 'girls' idiot

337
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:33,760
Just one girl is enough

338
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:38,010
I will keep her here and take great care

339
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:40,470
Like dog's greed is gone by showing a stone

340
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,970
Even I lost the greed
for girls from today dude

341
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:47,050
I am in so much pain

342
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:52,550
that only I can hear to the 'Jabilli Kosam'
song, which none of you can hear

343
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:55,300
Hey dirty rascal,
your phone is ringing from half an hour

344
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,180
why don't you answer it?

345
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:57,760
Hey krishna

346
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,470
Jalandra.. who was in Gopika getup
in the morning is calling dude

347
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,720
Hello! Girl!

348
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:03,100
Where are you babe?

349
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:04,390
If not a bad time

350
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,180
He looks like a nib dipped in black ink

351
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,890
His love is set too

352
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,040
Crap!

353
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,010
From so many days,
I have been waiting to tell you something

354
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,680
What Ayyappa why are you gasping so much?

355
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:13,510
뭐야?

356
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,430
My sister is saying she would die.

357
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:17,550
Girl you wait and I will call you back

358
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:21,640
Our MLA's son is torturing her dude

359
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:24,100
today, he lay his hands all over her body

360
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,140
She tried to drink
pesticide with that insult

361
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:27,850
Hey Manikantha,
- Say dude..

362
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:28,760
start the vehicle

363
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,180
That Mridangarao called again

364
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,100
Mridangarao?

365
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,180
Who is he?

366
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:38,640
Not just the names of girls but
remember a few names of boys too.

367
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,720
Mridangarao is the program
Manager in Hyderabad

368
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,600
He is doing a penance on
single leg to have your concert

369
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,350
Ask him to stand back on two
legs and to stop calling you

370
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:12,190
It takes the same time for you to
prepare noodles and to woo girls

371
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:13,230
How is it possible dude?

372
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:17,480
It should be seen in our
eyes as how much we want them

373
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,230
It should hit them hard like a cyclone

374
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,650
only then such effect will be seen

375
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:29,730
Hey!

376
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:33,770
What are you going to do..?

377
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:51,100
Hey please dude...

378
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:53,190
Arjun please dude

379
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:17,810
Damn!

380
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,230
Oh! shit.. cops

381
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,940
¡Oh, no!

382
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:42,400
Why does that fellow look like
a polar bear in Police uniform?

383
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:43,480
We are done for

384
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:46,020
You know what Sigmund Freud
said in such situations?

385
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:47,650
Has he asked to escape leaving the car?

386
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,310
Huh?

387
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:50,980
Look properly

388
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,020
What happened dude, Police have come.
Any problem?

389
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,190
You saw the uniform and I saw
the hot body in that uniform

390
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,230
You are too much dude

391
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:31,940
It is ok

392
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:34,480
but there are no NGOs or
charities in this street

393
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:35,730
Why have you come this way?

394
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:36,480
I know that

395
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:37,770
I came to see you

396
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:38,520
You know right

397
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,650
they are kidnapping many
kids under woman trafficking

398
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:43,560
converting into prostitutes by force

399
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:47,060
Just in Europe 3000 girls
have been kidnapped last year

400
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,100
We rescued many from them through our NGO

401
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:54,270
But as the victims increase, we don't have
enough funds as the expenses have gone up

402
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:55,110
So?

403
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,560
If you do a concert free of cost

404
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:59,940
and donate the money collected to the NGO

405
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:02,060
it would be helpful for those poor girls

406
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:02,810
See buddy

407
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:06,770
ask me for an autograph or selfie
but do not ask for these donations

408
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:07,770
Not like that dude

409
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,100
A human should have some humanity right?

410
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,600
To develop in life we must never question
ourselves whether we are good or bad

411
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:15,810
Not that Arjun

412
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,190
It is time for my practice

413
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,150
have your tea and leave

414
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,310
Waiter... Sorry

415
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:29,560
- Peter,

416
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:30,520
what's up bro?

417
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:31,400
Hey!

418
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,650
I have been searching for you from
two days giving up the marriage

419
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:34,980
Неужели?"

420
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:37,650
Why did Jessi not ping me
when you were not at home?

421
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:40,770
What a waste of an opportunity?

422
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:42,600
Smash him

423
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,980
How dare you to hit an MLA's son!

424
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,440
Not just an MLA

425
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,560
I will even hit son of MPTC
if he does idiotic works

426
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,900
MLA is bigger than MPTC dude

427
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:11,310
So, shall I now fear,
catch his shoes and plead to forgive or what?

428
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,650
You dirty shameless rascals
without any relations

429
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,650
Boys should fall behind the girls,
that is the rule put by the God

430
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:42,230
But, will you put hands,
do dirty deeds and make them cry rascals?

431
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:45,400
A girl who takes milk and food has
tried to drink pesticide because of you

432
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:43,270
Old man

433
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,190
How much is it for the vegetables?
- 500 Bucks.

434
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:46,480
Take it out

435
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:49,270
Madam Here

436
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,190
How much for the flowers?

437
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:50,940
300

438
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:54,770
Whose stick is this?

439
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:12,520
Dude ...

440
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:13,060
yes

441
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:15,770
Is there any bus from heaven to the village?

442
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:18,270
Why did you ask so?

443
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,060
If not, how did angels come into the bus?

444
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:26,850
How much is the stick?

445
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,190
It is not a stick

446
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,480
it's a selfie stick

447
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:32,100
This is not much costly

448
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,690
That is why I am giving by
pushing this fellow aside

449
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,350
Tell me how much is it

450
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,440
800 bucks

451
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:39,940
What is bucks like bugs?

452
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,810
No, bucks means money
- Oh

453
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,650
I am saying this stick is 800 rupees

454
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:50,690
Keep this 100

455
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,230
and I will give the rest later
- No

456
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:53,230
Keep it girl

457
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,020
Take it
- Thanks

458
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:58,680
You have to purchase the ticket

459
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:10,480
"A bed of jasmines, a bed at the fields"

460
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:18,150
"a night in the cool breeze and why
is the heart not listening to me?"

461
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:27,440
"There is love in heart,
there is an unforgettable word"

462
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:33,900
"Come as a song with the great feeling"

463
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:34,810
Krishna

464
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,600
What is it? Why are you shaking that way?

465
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:38,730
Seeing this girl

466
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:40,230
I alone can listen to a song

467
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:40,770
That means

468
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:41,650
this is it right?

469
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:42,310
No

470
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,060
See!

471
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:46,060
Hey rascal

472
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,480
bring the pan leaf and oak

473
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,310
Hey Kamalamma
- What?

474
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:50,850
Do you need a Kamal Hassan song?

475
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,800
Ok
- What okay? Disconnect.

476
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,310
OK

477
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,190
Arrived to Akkurti..

478
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:57,900
Come on, get down

479
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,400
Get down fast

480
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,060
Hi Capra hircus...

481
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,060
Oh

482
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,270
So cute right?

483
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:22,190
It's not Capra or Dwakra

484
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,150
it is a goat

485
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:24,690
Actually

486
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:27,230
The scientific name for
a goat is Capra hircus

487
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,770
Scientist name?

488
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,310
Bye Capara circus

489
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:35,310
Why do you see that way?
It seems that is not a goat

490
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,560
O Bože!

491
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:48,650
What a smile!

492
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,980
Like a rain showering in summer

493
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:58,850
Thanks Brahmaji,

494
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,810
If you had not come at a correct time

495
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,150
my glamour would have got damaged
because of Peter's frustration

496
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,270
It's not you getting into it but you
are making me get struck in everything

497
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:08,560
That Police has not left
till I gave him hundred Euros

498
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,980
If you do not put a break at least
now in the matter of girls...

499
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,310
Both our bodies too

500
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,190
Apply the break Brahmaji...

501
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:30,230
(Sanskrit poem)

502
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,600
Hey Arjun

503
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:57,400
It's awesome weather right! Yeah

504
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,440
It's superb

505
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,230
I think you don't like rain..
No..no..no It's not like that

506
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,150
It will be a lot of fun if we go there.

507
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:04,970
Can I?
- Hey! Sure.

508
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:02,770
Beautiful rain right?

509
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:04,650
Of course not as much as you

510
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:06,980
lesser by ten times

511
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:10,230
I am saying after seeing your eyes

512
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,060
twenty times less

513
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:14,900
I did not see your nose then

514
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,480
I think thirty times lesser

515
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,350
Finally I am saying after seeing the lips

516
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,100
There is no comparison at
all between you and the rain

517
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:25,730
what do you want?

518
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,020
Anything which reduces this cold is okay.

519
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:30,810
I mean.. coffee?

520
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:31,900
ENABLE LOCATION

521
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:34,480
I do not like to drink coffee with strangers

522
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:35,810
Strangers?

523
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:39,730
Do you not understand that we know
each other from the past seven births?

524
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:41,400
I understood

525
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:47,350
we should dial 1404 in Hyderabad
to hand over mad fellows like you

526
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,810
What should we dial in Europe?

527
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,400
I think you do not know who I am

528
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:53,600
I am Arjun

529
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:57,730
Few people call me a Rock star, few people
call me a Millionaire and few people...

530
00:33:58,650 --> 00:33:59,520
Leave all that

531
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,150
my studio apartment is just adjacent.

532
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,810
Shall we have fun for sometime?

533
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:05,770
Excuse me Mr. so called Rock star

534
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:08,600
I have seen so many flirts like you

535
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,020
I hate people like you

536
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,810
It is a waste how many
ever pick up lines you use

537
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:14,350
Bye!

538
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,230
Sexy and stubborn!

539
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,770
I like the combination

540
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,900
Has a girl rejected you?

541
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,440
This is breaking news in Europe

542
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:34,400
I don't know why,
but I come to know all such news

543
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:35,440
What Krishna

544
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:37,850
It seems you kicked that MLA's
son like a bull from Jallikattu?

545
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,310
He is like a snake

546
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,650
and will go for ten years long revenge

547
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:41,940
Be careful dude

548
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:44,350
That girl looks like a Telugu cinema
heroine when she doesn't smile

549
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:46,270
Tollywood heroine when smiling dude

550
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:47,810
What is wrong with this fellow dude?

551
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:51,060
He is talking irrelavantly like
Dravid in the cigarette Ad?

552
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:53,560
He is killing by saying
the same thing from an hour

553
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:55,190
He is saying that he saw a girl in bus

554
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,190
and she smiled at him

555
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,400
I may believe if a coconut
is harvested from rice bran

556
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:02,480
how do I believe that a
girl smiled at you dude?

557
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:04,770
Either you believe or go and
jump into the Kalyani dam

558
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,520
That girl has the quality like
Savitri madam from Mayabazar film

559
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,730
She got down in our village and
vanished in the time of biting a betel

560
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,400
I think he is gone mad as no girl
fell for him dude It seems so

561
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:27,270
I am seeing that girl everywhere dude

562
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:32,480
If only I am able to see
that girl coming running..

563
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,850
This is love for sure dude

564
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:42,650
Has she really come or what?

565
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,230
Can you please start the bike urgently?

566
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:46,650
chony

567
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:47,350
2

568
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,100
no time

569
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:48,940
Quick.

570
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,940
Hey, what is this dude?

571
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,190
That's what I am thinking

572
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:54,980
Come on drive

573
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:57,770
Move... Faster.

574
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:02,270
Some times coconuts are
harvested to rice bran, dude

575
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,270
I think even this girl has
fallen in love seeing me

576
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:10,810
If not what is this eloping at once?

577
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,060
Let us take my mom on the way

578
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:14,980
She is very much eager to see my marriage

579
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:16,100
What are you talking?

580
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,350
Drive fast to the mango garden

581
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,770
It seems Naja Naja bit someone there.
It's an emergency!

582
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:20,560
What is that?

583
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:23,400
Oh no, it seems a cobra bit
someone and I should give treatment

584
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,400
Did you get on the bike for that?

585
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:26,810
Go fast

586
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,190
The venom of the Cobra

587
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:34,770
the spoiled food eaten and
everything should be gone...

588
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:38,060
My cute son is bit by the snake...
Move aside

589
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,310
អ្នកជានរណា?

590
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,060
Doctor.

591
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,440
and do first aid for him urgently

592
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:45,060
a water bubble and a lamp to be blown out...

593
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,270
Om kreem Fut!

594
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:48,560
I am saying right...

595
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:49,690
Will you do me a small favor?

596
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,980
You hit a guy in the
morning in the bus right?

597
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:55,190
Beat even this guy the same way
and drive him out from here, please

598
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,520
Om Kreem Fut!

599
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,980
The spell that girl cast on me
worked better than the spell you cast

600
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,060
that's why your nose is bleeding

601
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:05,940
Do not think otherwise

602
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,190
Bye

603
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:15,650
You took so much pain to save life
of a stranger in an unknown village

604
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,850
There is no need to know
about a person for helping

605
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:23,600
Shall we leave?

606
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:48,350
One minute

607
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,600
There is a bus to Tirupati
early in the morning

608
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:00,690
Why are you saying me?

609
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,980
You said you would get your head
shaven if any girl sees me right?

610
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:05,060
It is not a girl there

611
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:06,940
but the sweetest milk dish of Chittoor

612
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:09,020
Shall I give money for charges
or you will bear and go?

613
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:26,600
Who is that girl?

614
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:31,520
Poor girl is saying she would
commit suicide if I do not love her

615
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:35,190
I have advised her it is wrong as her parents
would be into sorrow if she commits suicide

616
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,730
Oh great

617
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,310
ok... who is Krishna in this village?

618
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:44,810
It seems he would be behind
everyone and proposes right?

619
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,650
My grandpa asked me not to be
seen to him and move around safe

620
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:51,020
This world does not know the difference
between the diamond and a glass piece

621
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:52,400
He is not such a guy

622
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:56,230
Hey stop, this is my home, stop

623
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:00,230
Why is she asking to stop here?

624
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,960
Is this your house?
- Yes

625
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,350
Oh! By the way I am Riya

626
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:06,400
-Adın ne?

627
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:07,600
My name is...

628
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,690
I will go out and be back
- Okay.

629
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:10,650
OK

630
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:11,860
I will see you again.. bye.

631
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:12,730
Bye

632
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,100
Where have you been dear?

633
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,940
I just went out grandpa

634
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:19,350
Grandpa?

635
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,100
What Krishna?

636
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:24,730
Krishna?

637
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:27,100
What are you doing here instead of
driving the birds away at the fields?

638
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:29,350
The bike stopped when I was going there

639
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,350
Ok, go

640
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,190
Is this girl grand daughter of Sarpanch?

641
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,480
You dark rascal...

642
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:39,690
Hey no, leave dude...

643
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:42,770
Do you think I am any punctured tube
that you are dipping me like this?

644
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:45,230
when I asked whether
Sarpanch has a granddaughter

645
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:48,310
Then you gave a guarantee that there
isn't any like for a Mixie, grinder

646
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,480
Did I get dream that bloody
fellow will have a grand daughter?

647
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,770
Please leave me dude

648
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:55,150
Damn, you dirty rascal

649
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,850
Believing your words,
I caught the collar of that old fellow

650
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,400
No idea how to cool him now

651
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,770
Hello sir, you have to see this

652
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,190
I just clicked the bird of Meropidae
family which is a rare species

653
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,520
Good Job Subbalakshmi

654
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,310
Mail those pictures immediately to me

655
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:27,520
That is the cover page of
our magazine next edition

656
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:29,060
I am so excited sir

657
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:30,190
Thank you so much

658
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:34,850
Hey..

659
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:41,150
Hey, stop there.. you

660
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,230
Hey!

661
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:11,600
Wait, Brahmaji

662
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,270
I will handle him

663
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,980
You are not required for his range,
I am enough

664
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:22,100
He robbed my girlfriend's bag,
so I am correct

665
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:23,440
Even then..

666
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:27,150
I have been waiting from long
to either kill or die for you

667
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:28,900
Please let me do this

668
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:32,690
برۆ

669
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:37,520
Ok Brahmaji

670
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:39,900
you go for this time

671
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,230
Why should I die for your girlfriend's bag?

672
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:43,270
You go

673
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:46,150
You said you can give your life then?

674
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,100
I said that before knife was taken out

675
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,060
You can do, it is easy for you.

676
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:52,270
Hold this..

677
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,270
That is not enough for that fellow

678
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,100
пожалуйста, нет..

679
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,480
Even that is not enough for him

680
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:25,150
Crap! I missed him

681
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:26,940
Hello.. do you have another camera?

682
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:32,810
Understood.

683
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,940
Do you understand what have you done?

684
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:36,900
Hey.. Its okay

685
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:37,690
I will buy another camera

686
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:39,100
Who needs your dirty camera?

687
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:42,980
I clicked the photo of a rare
bird taking trouble for two months

688
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,310
I clicked a rare bird

689
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:46,100
It was my dream

690
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:49,480
You spoiled everything by the
time I was mailing to the office

691
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,190
Actually

692
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:52,150
to help you..

693
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,600
Did I ask for help?

694
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:56,400
I will kill you both if I see you again

695
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:57,100
Excuse me.

696
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,480
Will you kill us for a bird?

697
00:42:58,690 --> 00:42:59,940
Are they any wings or legs we have not seen?

698
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,400
At KFC

699
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:02,400
¡Oh, no!

700
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:08,600
Not when girls are drenched in
rain or walking on the flowers

701
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,440
Real beauty is out only when
they hit someone like this

702
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:12,560
Thank you,

703
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:15,810
Do not tell anybody about
that girl hitting me dude

704
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:29,030
What is this?
Heartbeat is more heard than the box.

705
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:34,530
저기있다!

706
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:37,610
That's the matter

707
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:40,450
Hey birds, happy Independence Day

708
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:45,740
You usually hit men right? What is this box?

709
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:46,950
This is the actual work of brother, right?

710
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:48,700
I wanted to play music for the birds

711
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:51,490
Hey, you go and buy snacks at Nadar shop

712
00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:52,990
Hey snacks... move

713
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:56,450
He dies for snacks

714
00:43:57,610 --> 00:43:58,360
Where have you come out?

715
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:01,700
Oh, I urgently need to make call.
There is no signal at home

716
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:04,070
Grandpa sent him as company saying
signal would come somewhere here

717
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:07,320
I will give you company from here, come

718
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,570
Ok, where are you from?

719
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:10,740
Hyderabad

720
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,320
I came to visit grandpa as I had holidays

721
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:16,200
I and your grandpa have a great friendship

722
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:19,240
Yes I know, it seems you caught his collar

723
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:22,030
Here eat

724
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,280
Hey! Tamarindus indica

725
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:26,260
I know that thw words of ladies
carry a different meaning but

726
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:27,460
I do not understand your words at all

727
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,700
Actually I studied EAMCET
four years for Medicine seat

728
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:34,700
Thus it has become a habit to call
everything with scientific names

729
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,110
Is there a fair going on here?

730
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:49,760
To say in your Doctor language,

731
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,140
signal in our village would be
very weak like a patient with fever

732
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:55,070
It is a full signal here,
this tree is our tower

733
00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:57,070
We can speak to even
America sarpanch from here

734
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:01,070
Hey Krishna, I got to talk to your uncle.
Dial this number son

735
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:03,150
You love uncle a lot aunty

736
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,000
Love or my foot,

737
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:07,280
that idiot has gone three days back
saying he is going to Kalahasti

738
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:10,070
Dirty idiot,
no idea where he has fallen drunk

739
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:11,820
Here talk
- Ok

740
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:14,510
Hello, hello

741
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:15,740
Why is she scolding lke that?

742
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:17,400
They talk with their husbands like this here

743
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:19,900
That is the love

744
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:23,990
You said should call someone, come on

745
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:26,110
Sit here, you get a good signal

746
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:31,150
Thanks
- Ok, talk

747
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:35,740
Hi dude

748
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:37,610
What are you doing here
instead of putting punctures?

749
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:41,450
Oh that? My babe was asking
beauty tips and I am saying.

750
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:42,530
Ok, why are you here?

751
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,780
I will not draw this time even
if you give me a lakh of rupees.

752
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:46,570
Remember that? Lembra disso?

753
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:48,400
Whom are you being so harsh to dude?

754
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:50,030
This fellow, recharge Balaji dude

755
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,860
When I asked money he just gave 60 rupees
saying this is more for your spelling mistakes

756
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:55,360
Is there at least one mistake dude?

757
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,490
I do not see any
- Krishna!

758
00:46:02,110 --> 00:46:03,320
Hi.

759
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:04,030
Zdravím...

760
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:06,240
Your friends?

00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,070
He is Murali

762
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:08,780
Hi. Hi.

763
00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:11,110
He is Black Srinu
- Hi

764
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:15,150
They were just asking what is the name
of their sister and you just came in

765
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,280
Riya

766
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:18,650
You made her sister just for giving the hand,
idiot

767
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:21,860
Krishna,
I do not know anyone well in this village

768
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:23,740
Shall I show you around the village?
- Yes

769
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,740
Ok Take my number

770
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:28,740
¡Oh, no!

771
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:30,900
Zdravím...

772
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:33,070
Zdravím...

773
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:37,070
Say

774
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:45,900
Why are your hands shivering like that?

775
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:49,110
Nothing,
it is time for a drink and that is the reason

776
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:55,240
A joy that mobile number of a girl is
entering into my phone for the first time

777
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,070
Ok, anyway we shall meet tomorrow.

778
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:00,900
Sorry!

779
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:03,860
Bye!

780
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,570
Dude, say the spelling of Riya

781
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:13,400
RO... YYA Riya, yes

782
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:19,240
Hey dude, it is like a hoarding has come
for the guy who paints number plates

783
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:20,320
Your story has changed.

784
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:21,530
Are you giving a party or not?

785
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:23,150
Yes dude, you have to give a party

786
00:47:23,450 --> 00:47:27,740
Why do you ask party so slowly, our sound
should be heard in whole Chittoor district

787
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:28,820
Start music

788
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:41,780
"See the way and the dust dude,
watch the row of buffalos"

789
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:55,280
"See the way and the dust dude,
watch the row of buffalos"

790
00:47:55,530 --> 00:48:02,490
"On the bridge of Kamalapudi,
watch the swing of the babes dude"

791
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:08,780
"On the bridge of Kamalapudi,
watch the swing of the babes dude"

792
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:26,820
"Hey boy in blue shirt with a sharp nose"

793
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:32,820
"Hey boy in blue shirt with a sharp nose"

794
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:40,240
"You have got a beautiful babe,
hey dude with naughty looks"

795
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:46,400
"hey dude with naughty looks"

796
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:52,400
"You have wooed the babe
living in the bungalow"

797
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:58,320
"You have wooed the babe
living in the bungalow"

798
00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:05,780
"The beauty in your love came
to the slum from the fort"

799
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:28,780
"In the semi thick forest,
a beautiful rain has come"

800
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:34,820
"In the semi thick forest,
a beautiful rain has come"

801
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:42,070
"You are trapped in love
climbing over toughest mountains"

802
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:48,240
"You are trapped in love
climbing over toughest mountains"

803
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:54,280
"Holding a flower umbrella,
accompanied by the village folk"

804
00:49:54,530 --> 00:50:00,280
"Holding a flower umbrella,
accompanied by the village folk"

805
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:07,740
"You have become a couple under the
cool shade of the thached canopy"

806
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:13,780
"You have become a couple under the
cool shade of the thached canopy"

807
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:28,860
"Watch the swing of the babes"

808
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:53,030
I saw Subbalakshmi.

809
00:50:55,110 --> 00:50:55,530
Where?

810
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:00,070
Hi Subbalakshmi

811
00:51:01,570 --> 00:51:04,070
Isn't being so vengeful for a bird wrong?

812
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:05,360
Don't irritate me

813
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:11,360
Give me your number and I
will never irritate again

814
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:13,950
Give me your phone once

815
00:51:25,570 --> 00:51:27,820
There are a total of 221 numbers of girls

816
00:51:28,070 --> 00:51:31,860
Save even yours and it will become 222,
a fancy number

817
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:34,950
Throw it
- What?

818
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:39,740
Subbalakshmi

819
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:48,900
Hey, that is a phone worth one lakh ruppes!

820
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:50,970
The problem now is not
about one lakh rupees dude

821
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:53,770
Those were the contacts collected
after hard work from one year

822
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:55,320
Go and bring it

823
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:56,570
You crazy..

824
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:00,360
See, I threw the phone too

825
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:02,820
your assistant is ready to bring that right?

826
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,030
You know what Sigmund Freud
said in such situations?

827
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:07,990
Has he said not to believe a fraud like you?

828
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:10,740
Ok, let's do one thing

829
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:13,200
Look into my eyes for two minutes

830
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:17,490
If you do not understand my true intentions
even then, I will never disturb you again

831
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:47,110
Thanks Arjun

832
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:50,570
For what?

833
00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:55,070
I would not have understood how big
cheater you are, if you had not done so

834
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:59,990
Maybe there is magnet in
your eyes but I am not iron.

835
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:00,700
Bye!

836
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,200
You said, it should hit them like a cyclone.

837
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:12,400
Not even a sound of fan air was there

838
00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:14,530
Effect is not there dude, but here

839
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:16,700
I did not understand

840
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:21,360
Till the time she was looking in to my eyes,
Was she really not in my life till now?

841
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:22,570
Why she was not there?

842
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:25,570
What was I doing without her?
I had all such thoughts dude

843
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:29,110
I think she is made for me.

844
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:30,990
Or maybe I am made for her

845
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:33,740
Or maybe both actually

846
00:53:35,110 --> 00:53:37,530
I never had such magical feeling
all these days seeing any girl

847
00:53:38,030 --> 00:53:41,990
I understand now, why so? I think...
I think she is my soul mate, damn it

848
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:47,110
You always tell me to look for a good girl,
marry and settle down right?

849
00:53:47,450 --> 00:53:48,030
I am ready dude

850
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:50,610
She is the one

851
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:52,030
What do you want to do now?

852
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:16,780
"I met that dream which my eyes never
had maybe this is because of you"

853
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:27,280
"I asked a question haunting in my heart, is
your heart the friendship I was in search of?"

854
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:38,200
"This tide which cannot reach
the shore is crossing the seas"

855
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:48,150
"One heart is not enough if this
naughtiness is overshadowing"

856
00:54:48,610 --> 00:54:53,780
"I want to fly,
want to fly being half in you"

857
00:54:53,950 --> 00:54:58,860
"Has my truth come face
to face and called me?"

858
00:54:59,110 --> 00:55:09,360
"Love feeling it inside, this glow has come as a
boon. Is this the feeling never heard in any story?"

859
00:55:30,650 --> 00:55:32,990
"Come on, believe in what I
am saying once Subbalakshmi"

860
00:55:33,610 --> 00:55:38,320
You, your words, hairstyle and your
behaviour Why would anyone believe you?

861
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:55,200
"I just came to know that there
are no boundaries for thoughts"

862
00:55:55,530 --> 00:56:00,360
"Thus has the heart run
over the bridge of looks"

863
00:56:00,610 --> 00:56:05,700
"Feel this moment sway in the
heat cooler than the moonlight"

864
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:10,360
"Being a warmer thought in your day,
I will melt your heart away"

865
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:20,360
"One life, let that become yours
Girl your smile, let it be my world"

866
00:56:21,570 --> 00:56:31,740
"I met that dream which my eyes never
had maybe this is because of you"

867
00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:37,150
"I want to fly,
want to fly being half in you"

868
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:42,360
"Has my truth come face
to face and called me?"

869
00:56:57,990 --> 00:57:03,530
"Baby let me kiss you,
caress you hold you tight my baby boo"

870
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:07,320
"Never let you go away
from me coz I got issues"

871
00:57:07,450 --> 00:57:11,240
"Well, I miss you but still I love
the way you look me in my eyes"

872
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:14,360
"And say those diamonds and the
buzz do not matter to you babe"

873
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,030
"One love one life one wife and that is you"

874
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:19,490
"True love from the heart I trust you"

875
00:57:19,610 --> 00:57:24,030
"I searched for myself in your world"

876
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:29,240
"I walked with you being your shadow"

877
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:34,490
"I never face the minute
I forget your thoughts"

878
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:39,990
"Naughty heart came to know
about the burden of my dreams"

879
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:45,360
"I want to fly,
want to fly being half in you"

880
00:57:45,610 --> 00:57:50,570
"Has my truth come face
to face and called me?"

881
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:55,950
"Love feeling it inside,
this glow has come as a boon"

882
00:57:56,070 --> 00:58:00,610
"Is this the feeling
never heard in any story?"

883
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:05,740
"I want to fly,
want to fly being half in you"

884
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:11,150
"Has my truth come face
to face and called me?"

885
00:58:11,570 --> 00:58:16,780
"Love feeling it inside,
this glow has come as a boon"

886
00:58:16,950 --> 00:58:22,150
"Is this the feeling
never heard in any story?"

887
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,490
Why did you bring me here dude?

888
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:31,240
By mistake have you planned for
any penance for that girl or what?

889
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:32,860
Where is this aunty?

890
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:34,070
Aunty?

891
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:48,700
"The sacred feet washed by Brahma,
that feet is the power of Universe.."

892
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:59,110
"The sacred feet washed by Brahma,
that feet is the power of Universe.."

893
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,700
It is like four to five animals
are shouting at once in a zoo

894
00:59:02,150 --> 00:59:03,200
Who is she dude?

895
00:59:03,450 --> 00:59:05,570
"Your feet.."

896
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:12,820
It is amazing, it is Magnus

897
00:59:15,490 --> 00:59:17,400
If music is personified,
it would look like aunty right?

898
00:59:18,110 --> 00:59:23,110
I think in the first line just now,
you took a turn

899
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,280
Did I?

900
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:27,240
Mind blowing

901
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:30,740
Many thanks, who are you by the way?

902
00:59:31,650 --> 00:59:34,150
Not as much as you but I
am a small time musician

903
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:37,950
From a long time I have been thinking to
do a fusion mixing Western and classical

904
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:41,070
Correctly... Thank God you are found luckily

905
00:59:41,610 --> 00:59:43,280
Hey, you plan a grand concert immediately

906
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:45,110
Concert?
- Yes

907
00:59:45,150 --> 00:59:48,400
Oh no, I fear singing before so many people

908
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:52,200
People should fear to listen,
why do you fear for singing?

909
00:59:52,610 --> 00:59:53,490
What is he saying?

910
00:59:53,650 --> 00:59:56,860
He is saying we shall plan a world tour,
immediately giving you training

911
00:59:57,530 --> 01:00:00,110
World tour means I am ready
- Aunty ready

912
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:02,900
By the way your name is
not your name from today

913
01:00:03,030 --> 01:00:03,570
the edges and

914
01:00:03,610 --> 01:00:07,400
Your name from now is Dinchak Roja

915
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:10,110
Oh, I like it

916
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:10,900
Perfect.

917
01:00:11,030 --> 01:00:15,070
So even the name is set and if a
nice place for training is set...

918
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:16,740
My house is there dear

919
01:00:18,450 --> 01:00:22,320
They arrange guns and hand grenades in a row
before the press when terrorists are caught

920
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:23,820
This great lady has done such an arrangement

921
01:00:25,110 --> 01:00:27,530
Hey, whom are you searching for?

922
01:00:31,950 --> 01:00:34,740
Oh, is this your plan?
- Smart boy

923
01:00:35,610 --> 01:00:37,570
What idiots,
you directly came into the house?

924
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:39,740
I will call the Police if you
immediately do not get out

925
01:00:39,990 --> 01:00:41,530
You talked so cute like a
puppy when drunk at night

926
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:43,360
why are you coming over
now like an Alsatian?

927
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:45,570
Who allowed you inside rascal?

928
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:46,740
It's me who allowed them dear.

929
01:00:46,950 --> 01:00:51,030
Mixing this Western and classical music,
some fu...

930
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:52,280
What is that dear?
- Fusion aunty

931
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:54,030
Yes, for doing the fusion

932
01:00:54,110 --> 01:00:56,530
Not fusion but they came to make you a fool,
aunty

933
01:00:56,950 --> 01:01:00,200
Do not call me aunty, call me Dinchak Roja

934
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:03,700
Ok,
what is the need for him to make me a fool?

935
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:06,490
Yes, why should someone do?
She is already that, right?

936
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:08,990
What is he saying?
- He is saying tea is too good aunty

937
01:01:09,150 --> 01:01:10,400
Oh, thanks

938
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:13,570
Oh, I forgot!
This is my husband and he works in a bank

939
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:14,280
Hello sir

940
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,450
Hubby, give a shake hand

941
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:21,530
I am sorry, but chip of sir...

942
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:25,030
No, he is slightly deaf
- Lucky fellow

943
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:27,150
Oh, thank you

944
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:31,110
Yes dear, when are we starting our practice?

945
01:01:31,570 --> 01:01:32,990
Master should say that

946
01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:37,030
It is you
- What do I know to teach?

947
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:38,200
What does she know to learn?

948
01:01:38,530 --> 01:01:39,450
What is he saying?

949
01:01:39,490 --> 01:01:42,990
He says the time is great and we shall
immediately start without wasting even a second

950
01:01:43,070 --> 01:01:46,110
Oh, is it?
Be right here, I will bring the Tamboora.

951
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:47,030
Hubby, come on

952
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:50,950
She is gone like asking to be right here
so that she will bring a knife to stab

953
01:01:51,110 --> 01:01:52,320
Go and teach

954
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:55,650
I am not like my aunt
to believe in your words

955
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:58,820
I know very well how to
send you out from here

956
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:00,320
Good luck

957
01:02:14,610 --> 01:02:16,570
We will die if Sarpanch
wakes up What the catch?

958
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:18,610
Hey dark rascal, see and walk

959
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:20,450
Nothing is visible here to see and walk

960
01:02:20,650 --> 01:02:22,320
Still this is a copper tumbler and
will not break even if it falls

961
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:26,360
That will not break if
fallen but we will be broken

962
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:36,950
Hey dude,
come here Sarpanch's car is punctured dude

963
01:02:38,450 --> 01:02:40,320
Will you now go home,
bring the tools and mend the puncture?

964
01:02:40,450 --> 01:02:41,950
Good idea, wait dude.
I will go and come back

965
01:02:55,110 --> 01:02:57,320
Hey come Wait, I am coming

966
01:02:58,530 --> 01:03:04,110
See dude, how bright is her face
glowing even in the darkness

967
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:06,820
She is like the lamp of moonlight

968
01:03:07,070 --> 01:03:09,200
Huh,
no chance that we can believe the girls dude.

969
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:10,900
They sleep applying face
packs even at nights

970
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:13,570
Where is the pack you rascal,
see with four eyes if needed

971
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:15,320
Wait dude, I will see and say

972
01:03:21,450 --> 01:03:23,820
True dude, she is too good

973
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:26,610
You are lucky dude
- I told you right?

974
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,570
But I am unlucky dude
- Why is that?

975
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:35,150
My head got stuck dude

976
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:38,570
You dirty rascal,
how did you keep it like that?

977
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:40,320
What do I know? Do something

978
01:03:40,570 --> 01:03:43,240
Wait, wait I am pulling

979
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:48,900
Pull dude

980
01:03:52,110 --> 01:03:53,650
Stretch you waste fellow

981
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:58,950
When it was said not to head start any work as per
the stars, I did not know that I should put my head so

982
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:01,530
What do we do now dude?

983
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:11,450
Why did all come dude,
I think I am done today?

984
01:04:11,490 --> 01:04:13,030
You dark rascal
- Say dude.

985
01:04:13,070 --> 01:04:15,320
do you come for a robbery to the
house of our God like Sarpanch?

986
01:04:15,530 --> 01:04:16,360
Me?

987
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:17,860
Have I come then?

988
01:04:17,950 --> 01:04:19,280
We came together, dude...

989
01:04:20,030 --> 01:04:22,420
Yes idiot,
we both together moved around and grew up.

990
01:04:22,710 --> 01:04:24,220
Do you think I will pardon
you because of that?

991
01:04:25,150 --> 01:04:26,360
Hey you come and cut it.

992
01:04:26,650 --> 01:04:27,450
If possible cut even the neck

993
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:29,400
No, hey this is not right dude

994
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:31,530
Not that dude I will hit you
with a slipper if you talk again

995
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:34,900
You mend puncture in the day
and commit robberies at nights?

996
01:04:34,950 --> 01:04:36,110
Why he changed his way..?

997
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:39,490
Laying hands in the hundi of God and robbery
at the house of Sarpanch are the same

998
01:04:39,820 --> 01:04:42,280
Then you caught his collar recently right?

999
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,740
It is been a year since
we both forgot this matter

1000
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:49,150
Still, we are to be relatives and
we will have so many in between us

1001
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:50,400
Why do you need, you carbon face rascal?

1002
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,400
Will you rob again?

1003
01:04:57,450 --> 01:05:01,150
Madam, you go to a side,
he is hitting more as you are seeing

1004
01:05:04,450 --> 01:05:05,650
Go and fall on the feet of Sarpanch.

1005
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:08,110
No need, get out

1006
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,950
Yes, you are not qualified even
to fall on his feet. Get out

1007
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:12,150
You too

1008
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:16,030
Me? Yes you, come on let us go

1009
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:18,030
Sir, your car tire is punctured.

1010
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:19,230
I will open the shop at 10.
You come and I will repair it for free

1011
01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:23,820
That is dude, we saw it down in the
night when we were coming right?

1012
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:24,570
He said get out right?

1013
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:27,070
You have no shame? You say to repair
punctures again, get out rascal

1014
01:05:28,570 --> 01:05:30,700
Why did that old guy say so even
after I acted so much, dude?

1015
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:33,820
What you did was not acting, but over acting

1016
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:37,950
Leave that, I did not have any food
from night and I am very hungry

1017
01:05:38,070 --> 01:05:39,490
Get me one plate idli dude

1018
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:43,210
What a great day...(Song Humming)

1019
01:05:43,630 --> 01:05:55,630
Sankara... Body of tunes... (Song Humming)

1020
01:05:57,210 --> 01:06:07,460
Lord travelling over the epics...
(Song Humming)

1021
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:12,630
Sankara...

1022
01:06:17,170 --> 01:06:18,840
You come home directly?

1023
01:06:19,670 --> 01:06:22,300
This break less car is
correct for your speed

1024
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:24,340
Arjun..

1025
01:06:25,050 --> 01:06:26,250
Will you do me a help?

1026
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:29,210
Just one, I do not like single digits at all

1027
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:31,130
Ask for a hundred and I will do

1028
01:06:32,590 --> 01:06:34,500
You need to bring a pet Doctor urgently

1029
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:36,840
What happened.. is Aunty feeling sick?

1030
01:06:37,630 --> 01:06:41,130
Not for aunty but for the puppy Puppy,
what's wrong with it?

1031
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:43,630
No idea, but it is very weak.

1032
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:45,250
Bring a Doctor urgently...

1033
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:47,500
Doctor will be here in two minutes,

1034
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:50,380
Bye

1035
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:57,210
She is not letting me to have even break
fast.. Damn bloody life. Move a side.

1036
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:00,960
Hey, give the keys urgently

1037
01:07:01,170 --> 01:07:03,420
What is so urgent? Still,
where are you leaving without training aunty?

1038
01:07:03,670 --> 01:07:05,340
That Dinchik Roja is killing with her songs.

1039
01:07:05,670 --> 01:07:08,630
I will be the first person dying
listening to songs if I stay back here

1040
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:09,960
Give the keys, please dude

1041
01:07:10,130 --> 01:07:12,050

Oh no,

01:07:21,050 --> 01:07:21,800
¡Oh, no!

1046
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:28,000
Hey Gurumurthy...

1047
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:29,250
Gurumurthy

1048
01:07:29,590 --> 01:07:30,090
Krishna..

1049
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:34,090
What are screaming so in the midnight dude?
What is wrong?

1050
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:35,420
Move fast to the house of Sarpanch.

1051
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:37,550
His granddaughter is hurt
and become unconcious.

1052
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:38,340
You come dude

1053
01:07:38,630 --> 01:07:40,500
First tell me in detail what happened..?

1054
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,090
Where is this girl?

1055
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:58,050
Why did you scare me..?
- Shhh!

1056
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:00,920
Why did you come?

1057
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:06,300
I have come to inspect whether some
thief has come again like yesterday

1058
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:07,380
Yes, he came

1059
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:12,130
I know that you too had come
yesterday along with your friend

1060
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:13,750
Krishna

1061
01:08:14,380 --> 01:08:15,550
Please take me out

1062
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:17,420
What? In this darkness?

1063
01:08:18,380 --> 01:08:21,960
A famous writer wrote that actual beauty
of a village can be seen at nights

1064
01:08:22,130 --> 01:08:24,630
I think he does not know about our
village dogs. They bite to kill

1065
01:08:25,050 --> 01:08:26,000
Please Krishna

1066
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:30,340
Ok but, we should jump over the
wall to go out. Can you do that?

1067
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:31,960
Coming

1068
01:08:32,710 --> 01:08:34,670
Ok come slowly, slowly.

1069
01:08:35,380 --> 01:08:36,460
Slow, come on

1070
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:39,800
Hold the hand.

1071
01:08:41,090 --> 01:08:42,050
Here, come on

1072
01:08:50,590 --> 01:08:52,500
Place leg on my shoulder and... No...

1073
01:08:56,170 --> 01:08:56,750
Hey!

1074
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:01,420
Riya...

1075
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:02,840
Let's go fast

1076
01:09:03,130 --> 01:09:07,250
Situation of Kaveri is tough inside with
baby upside down and in such a condition...

1077
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:09,590
You stay right here

1078
01:09:10,090 --> 01:09:13,300
Say where and how deep is the wound
and I will give at least medicines

1079
01:09:15,630 --> 01:09:16,630
How do I say dude

1080
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:24,340
Say what to do for this?

1081
01:09:36,590 --> 01:09:38,550
What happened Krishna,
what is that wound on the head?

1082
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,210
I had been to Doctor for you.

1083
01:09:40,460 --> 01:09:42,050
He could not come and
asked how did it get hurt

1084
01:09:42,670 --> 01:09:43,630
I could not say, so I showed.

1085
01:09:44,170 --> 01:09:46,420
Are you mad? See how it is bleeding

1086
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:49,710
You do not get tensed,
such wounds are normal for me

1087
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:52,340
I was worried something may happen to you

1088
01:09:53,550 --> 01:09:54,750
Why so much worry?

1089
01:10:00,170 --> 01:10:00,920
No problem

1090
01:10:07,550 --> 01:10:08,130
Riya..

1091
01:10:10,750 --> 01:10:11,340
Riya..

1092
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:12,920
Riya..

1093
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:14,920
Riya..

1094
01:10:24,550 --> 01:10:26,670
Brahmaji... How is he Doctor?

1095
01:10:27,050 --> 01:10:29,340
He is in Coma, we tried our best. I am sorry

1096
01:10:29,670 --> 01:10:30,920
When will he recover?

1097
01:10:31,130 --> 01:10:33,460
I do not know, maybe it takes a year

1098
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:35,380
He needs shock treatment

1099
01:10:36,090 --> 01:10:37,550
what about my concert then...

1100
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:42,550
Brahmaji, that Mridangarao called again.

1101
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,590
I am doing the concert in Hyderabad.

1102
01:10:45,090 --> 01:10:45,800
Brahmaji!

1103
01:10:49,630 --> 01:10:52,670
Hey Brahmaji, I am going to marry dude

1104
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:55,210
Who do you think it is? Our Subbalakshmi

1105
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:56,630
Hello..
- He is dying

1106
01:10:57,380 --> 01:10:58,210
He is dying

1107
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:01,250
He will die, he is in coma. Please cooperate

1108
01:11:02,050 --> 01:11:02,630
Arjun..

1109
01:11:03,550 --> 01:11:07,130
music heals anything.
Shall I try just for once?

1110
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:13,670
Wow... Shock treatment

1111
01:11:14,380 --> 01:11:15,340
You start aunty

1112
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:16,460
Yes, I am doing..

1113
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:28,960
Lord is the same,
the super power is the same

1114
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:29,630
Did you see that? Amazing,

1115
01:11:29,750 --> 01:11:30,550
Brahmaji returns.

1116
01:11:30,630 --> 01:11:31,090
Thanks Aunty.

1117
01:11:31,130 --> 01:11:34,380
It sounds like the bull has screamed in
the world of Yama Am I alive or dead?

1118
01:11:37,590 --> 01:11:38,170
Doctor.

1119
01:11:40,090 --> 01:11:43,880
Wow, it is a medical miracle
- Miracle or Oracle? It is a murder.

1120
01:11:44,420 --> 01:11:45,590
You stop it Oh no

1121
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:52,210
Doctor, I want my coma back.
I want to be in coma

1122
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:54,300
I beg your feet, please Doctor No,
it is not possible

1123
01:11:54,340 --> 01:11:57,500
Doctor.. please, my coma
- Absolutely not possible,

1124
01:11:57,550 --> 01:11:58,250
No way

1125
01:11:58,340 --> 01:12:00,880
May insects fill in your stomach,
please Doctor! Please...

1126
01:12:01,210 --> 01:12:02,420
Are you feeling bad that I missed that out?

1127
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:06,800
I am very positive in such matters.

1128
01:12:07,630 --> 01:12:11,210
Do not think that I will not
try again as I missed out once

1129
01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:15,630
You will be alive if you
stay away..otherwise...

1130
01:12:22,090 --> 01:12:23,090
I want to marry you Subbalakshmi

1131
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:25,460
Huh!
How many girls did you say this to?

1132
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:27,590
That is correct

1133
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:30,960
I went around with many girls, but
never said this to any girl.

1134
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:32,300
This is the first time

1135
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:36,340
I really want to marry you Subbalakshmi

1136
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:41,880
I first met you with other
interest and followed you.

1137
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:43,550
But I am completely changed now

1138
01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:48,170
Now, you are my future completely. Please...

1139
01:12:49,210 --> 01:12:50,800
You are my...
- Why are you stumbling?

1140
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:54,460
Because I never spoke so
sincerely till now with any girl

1141
01:12:55,340 --> 01:12:58,500
I want to say something
but do not know how to say

1142
01:13:00,050 --> 01:13:01,340
But one thing is true,

1143
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:03,840
my life is with you now

1144
01:13:04,550 --> 01:13:06,300
I will be as you like, you...

1145
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:08,420
How can I tell you?

1146
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:14,550
Not here but maybe I can explain
better going to some romantic place

1147
01:13:16,590 --> 01:13:17,710
Let us go. Move.

1148
01:13:30,050 --> 01:13:30,750
Police station?

1149
01:13:31,130 --> 01:13:32,550
You asked for a romantic place right?

1150
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:36,210
There would be no better romantic place
than the Police station in this world

1151
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:41,960
Eat!

1152
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:49,670
Hello sir Hello

1153
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:53,300
He is harassing me,
I want to register a complaint against him

1154
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:55,340
Harass and me?

1155
01:13:57,170 --> 01:13:58,670
You said to do anything for me right?

1156
01:13:59,670 --> 01:14:00,250
Go to jail

1157
01:14:00,670 --> 01:14:01,130
- Out

1158
01:14:02,130 --> 01:14:04,630
But you should know that I have
none other than you in my life

1159
01:14:05,420 --> 01:14:06,000
You see!

1160
01:14:06,710 --> 01:14:09,630
If my hand falls on any girl or hands
of any girl fall on me from today...

1161
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:10,590
Hi

1162
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:20,170
Hey baby, did you come to see me?

1163
01:14:23,550 --> 01:14:27,000
This hand...My hand...

1164
01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:28,090
This is the last hand...

1165
01:14:28,710 --> 01:14:30,380
I mean after this, no more hand...

1166
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:31,960
This is your character,

1167
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:38,090
Subbalakshmi...

1168
01:14:39,130 --> 01:14:39,750
Subbalakshmi...

1169
01:14:42,590 --> 01:14:43,670
Put him behind bars

1170
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:57,840
Hey, if you cut red sandal again in
the forest I will beat you badly.

1171
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:58,550
برۆ

1172
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:01,170
Krishna is not a such a person

1173
01:15:01,210 --> 01:15:02,880
Nothing will happen I am frightened

1174
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,050
You do not worry, he will come

1175
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:06,750
Why did you leave him so brother?

1176
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:11,380
Where would he go?
He insulted hitting me before everyone

1177
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:14,380
I know where and how to finish him

1178
01:15:15,590 --> 01:15:16,170
Krishna,

1179
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:20,590
What is this nonsense son?
That MLA's son will not let you live

1180
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:22,590
We shall leave this village son

1181
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:23,920
Where will we go mom?

1182
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:25,500
live or die right in this village

1183
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:28,590
Still, why are you here? Go home
and prepare food for me. I will come

1184
01:15:29,250 --> 01:15:30,750
When did you care about my words?

1185
01:15:31,130 --> 01:15:32,960
You are born to torture me

1186
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:36,710
You take care of the other formalities
and call me if there is anything else

1187
01:15:38,630 --> 01:15:39,870
Ok, thank you
- Okay Madam.

1188
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,630
I did not cut any red sandal

1189
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:46,590
I know what you are, Krishna

1190
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:48,880
In fact I believe you more than in me.

1191
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:51,210
You be careful with that fellow

1192
01:15:51,670 --> 01:15:54,920
I escaped from your grandpa last
night and is this fellow anything big?

1193
01:15:56,550 --> 01:15:59,130
Oh I remembernow.
I have been here from morning.

1194
01:15:59,550 --> 01:16:00,380
What is the time now?

1195
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:02,460
6:30 aunty

1196
01:16:02,710 --> 01:16:03,670
Tell me when it is 7:30

1197
01:16:03,750 --> 01:16:06,090
I should go to hospital
with juice to visit Master

1198
01:16:06,550 --> 01:16:07,920
I even practiced a song

1199
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:11,460
Do not spoil my mood talking
about your master and that Arjun

1200
01:16:12,170 --> 01:16:14,090
I am happy after so many days

1201
01:16:15,250 --> 01:16:17,920
Subbu... Subbalakshmi

1202
01:16:18,710 --> 01:16:21,550
Poor guy Subbu, please withdraw that case

1203
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:34,090
What Subbu?

1204
01:16:43,550 --> 01:16:46,130
Aunty, this is the picture I took

1205
01:16:47,250 --> 01:16:49,000
Wow...It is so nice Subbu.

1206
01:16:58,750 --> 01:17:00,170
Sir Congrats Subbalakshmi

1207
01:17:00,250 --> 01:17:01,500
How did you get this picture?

1208
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:02,800
Are you surprised?

1209
01:17:03,250 --> 01:17:07,750
Already edition got printed with another picture
but he changed by giving this in the last minute

1210
01:17:08,130 --> 01:17:08,710
Who...?

1211
01:17:09,090 --> 01:17:09,670
Arjun.

1212
01:17:11,130 --> 01:17:12,130
He said not to inform you

1213
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:18,590
He fought a lot that the picture
you took should come anyhow

1214
01:17:19,630 --> 01:17:21,550
I think, he is in love with you

1215
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:33,590
30 members for 3 days, when we tried
sleepless could recover that camera

1216
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:37,380
So, not so rare birds but keep
clicking some normal birds too

1217
01:17:38,090 --> 01:17:38,670
Please?

1218
01:17:39,090 --> 01:17:44,130
It is my lifetime goal that a picture clicked
by me should come on the cover page Arjun

1219
01:17:46,750 --> 01:17:48,420
I worked very hard for this

1220
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:50,550
Mas...

1221
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:55,250
after knowing that it came because of you,
I lost the respect on it

1222
01:17:57,710 --> 01:17:58,550
I hate you,

1223
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:00,340
I hate you Arjun

1224
01:18:02,630 --> 01:18:03,420
Subbu Subbu

1225
01:18:15,670 --> 01:18:18,920
You do not worry Arjun,
I will just talk to her

1226
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:26,380
Hi. How are you?

1227
01:18:27,420 --> 01:18:29,420
Yes, it is been many many days

1228
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:32,670
Krishna has come, I will call you again

1229
01:18:33,340 --> 01:18:34,460
What, will you talk?

1230
01:18:35,670 --> 01:18:37,920
Sandeep,
my class mate and he wants talk to you

1231
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:41,960
chony

1232
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:43,630
Hi Krishna, how are you?

1233
01:18:44,630 --> 01:18:46,550
Riya said everything about you

1234
01:18:47,380 --> 01:18:49,800
It seems you propose
everyone in the village?

1235
01:18:50,460 --> 01:18:52,130
Why you still haven't propose to Riya?

1236
01:18:53,090 --> 01:18:56,670
Oh, you already aware that
I and Riya are in love?

1237
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:04,960
You should come to our marriage for sure

1238
01:19:05,250 --> 01:19:06,800
Give the phone to Riya, bye

1239
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:20,800
What did you say to him?

1240
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:38,500
Krishna...

1241
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:40,960
Krishna!

1242
01:19:44,750 --> 01:19:47,170
I am sorry Krishna
- Come on, you have no mistake in this

1243
01:19:47,710 --> 01:19:49,800
I did a mistake without
considering the differences

1244
01:19:50,550 --> 01:19:53,880
Still it's just my madness, why would
someone like me? What do I have?

1245
01:19:54,380 --> 01:19:55,380
Leave it, all these are common for me

1246
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:58,090
Listen to me Krishna
What is there to listen?

1247
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:01,210
I heard it many times from so many people

1248
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:04,050
A sparrow felt itself as a parrot
going crazy like me it seems

1249
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:08,090
I am an idiot beating the box at
village and you, a Doctor from city.

1250
01:20:08,630 --> 01:20:10,050
Why are you talking like mad?

1251
01:20:10,210 --> 01:20:12,710
Sandeep just spoke casually...
It should be in fate for everything

1252
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:14,710
My life is this way

1253
01:20:15,170 --> 01:20:16,300
What are you talking?

1254
01:20:16,710 --> 01:20:20,300
I will kill if another word comes
out from your mouth, you crazy rascal

1255
01:20:22,250 --> 01:20:24,460
Did you scold me? No I called

1256
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:28,920
You said they would call husbands like
this with love in your village, right?

1257
01:20:31,250 --> 01:20:31,840
That means...

1258
01:20:57,250 --> 01:21:00,500
Are you mad by any chance?
What does he have that you like him?

1259
01:21:00,670 --> 01:21:03,250
He may be having everything
but no sincerity aunty

1260
01:21:03,710 --> 01:21:05,500
You are saying he has nothing grandpa

1261
01:21:07,130 --> 01:21:09,170
But Krishna would give even his life for me

1262
01:21:09,590 --> 01:21:11,050
That is important for any girl right?

1263
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:15,000
Whatever you are saying is correct
but Arjun is completely changed now

1264
01:21:15,550 --> 01:21:17,670
Say what was the need for
him to do all this for you?

1265
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:20,090
He is using you as he has a need

1266
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:22,750
This is a plan by him to
take over your property.

1267
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:23,800
Forget that fellow

1268
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:27,090
Has he tortured me normally to forget?

1269
01:21:27,130 --> 01:21:29,800
Whatever you say, it is impossible
for my opinion on him to change

1270
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:31,800
He is a big cheater aunty

1271
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:34,210
You are thinking that he would cheat.

1272
01:21:34,590 --> 01:21:37,380
I am thinking that he would
keep me happy for life long

1273
01:21:37,710 --> 01:21:40,170
Whatever you think,
he is a very good guy Subbalakshmi

1274
01:21:40,710 --> 01:21:43,250
Please think positively
for once about him dear

1275
01:21:43,380 --> 01:21:44,800
No more thinking...

1276
01:21:45,050 --> 01:21:49,710
I cannot bear when all would say that my
granddaughter is in love with a guy beating the box

1277
01:21:50,300 --> 01:21:52,050
Get ready,
I will get you into the Hyderabad bus

1278
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:53,630
I will go to Hyderabad aunty

1279
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:57,710
You will not understand whatever I say.
He cheated you so much

1280
01:21:59,460 --> 01:22:00,460
It is my final decision

1281
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:07,090
"No never let me go.. No never let me go.
I will follow you.. where ever you go."

1282
01:22:07,210 --> 01:22:12,960
"No never let me go.. No never let me go.
I will follow you.. where ever you go."

1283
01:22:13,050 --> 01:22:15,130
Hey dude, Riya is leaving to Hyderabad

1284
01:22:18,250 --> 01:22:30,300
"How is it that my breathe stops
How did my story change so?"

1285
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:42,000
"Truth has become dream and
unbearable when you are not with me"

1286
01:22:42,460 --> 01:22:48,460
"Taking out half a second from second
Cutting out all seconds from the half second"

1287
01:22:48,550 --> 01:22:52,460
"It is like filling one minute of poison"

1288
01:22:54,500 --> 01:23:04,500
"Arranging the broken glass flowers
Changing it into the path to walk on"

1289
01:23:06,550 --> 01:23:13,130
"No never let me go.. No never let me go.
I will follow you.. where ever you go."

1290
01:23:13,210 --> 01:23:19,130
"No never let me go.. No never let me go.
I will follow you.. where ever you go."

1291
01:23:42,550 --> 01:23:53,300
"Behind thousands of miles and back of the mile
stones Do not change is into unreachable place"

1292
01:23:54,050 --> 01:24:05,300
"I am the drop of the drizzle and you are
the rainbow Show me the way to reach you"

1293
01:24:06,380 --> 01:24:12,420
"Showering shattered dreams and
arranging the fallen flowers"

1294
01:24:12,460 --> 01:24:16,460
"You ask to accept as a gift"

1295
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:24,500
"Arranging burning letters,
you made fire in heart as song"

1296
01:24:24,630 --> 01:24:28,840
"The poetry is burning on the body of paper"

1297
01:24:54,500 --> 01:25:01,090
"Nn never let me go.. No never let me go.
I will follow you.. where ever you go."

1298
01:25:01,130 --> 01:25:06,380
"No never let me go.. No never let me go.
I will follow you.. where ever you go."

1299
01:25:06,420 --> 01:25:12,420
"Taking out half a second from a second and
cutting out all seconds from the half second"

1300
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:16,420
"It is like filling one minute of poison"

1301
01:25:18,380 --> 01:25:24,420
"Arranging burning letters,
you made fire in heart as song"

1302
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:28,550
"The poetry is burning on the body of paper"

1303
01:25:40,250 --> 01:25:42,550
Sir, is Riya there?

1304
01:25:42,750 --> 01:25:43,500
This is the house of Riya.

1305
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:45,920
We are waiting for her
and she has not come yet

1306
01:25:50,250 --> 01:25:53,000
Hi uncle, my name is Arjun.
Is Subbalakshmi there?

1307
01:25:53,210 --> 01:25:56,460
She had to come in the morning.
I am trying her phone and it is switched off

1308
01:25:57,130 --> 01:25:58,170
Switch off?

1309
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:09,800
I will go to the washroom and come,
you stay Ok madam

1310
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:41,550
Excuse me,
can I use your phone to make a call?

1311
01:26:57,340 --> 01:26:58,550
Sorry madam.
- Idiot.

1312
01:26:59,380 --> 01:27:02,210
Hey, can't you see I did not see,
sorry madam sorry

1313
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:02,880
It's Okay. Sorry madam.

1314
01:28:14,670 --> 01:28:15,420
Excuse me Sir...

1315
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:16,590

1316
01:28:17,130 --> 01:28:18,090
Why did you come again?

1317
01:28:18,570 --> 01:28:18,980
Wat?

1318
01:28:19,550 --> 01:28:22,250
To trace out in an hour of registering
a complaint, am I any...

1319
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:25,210
Hey,
who is that with underwear over the pants?

1320
01:28:25,340 --> 01:28:26,170
Superman Sir

1321
01:28:26,420 --> 01:28:28,670
Yes, you think I am Super man?

1322
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:29,670
What do you mean by coming an hour earlier?

1323
01:28:31,340 --> 01:28:32,840
I've just come to give a complaint
that this girl is missing

1324
01:28:35,250 --> 01:28:36,340
How do I look ?

1325
01:28:37,250 --> 01:28:41,340
Hey, this is the guy bringing the missing case of
girl from Akkurthi of Chittoor district, right?

1326
01:28:41,630 --> 01:28:43,670
Yes sir, he ate brains for half an hour

1327
01:28:44,130 --> 01:28:45,500
What... me?

1328
01:28:45,710 --> 01:28:46,920
You changed the dress, ok.

1329
01:28:47,750 --> 01:28:49,000
Have you even changed the
photo of the girl and come?

1330
01:28:50,050 --> 01:28:51,340
I don't understand what you are saying

1331
01:28:51,420 --> 01:28:53,300
My name is Arjun and I came
this morning from Europe

1332
01:28:53,670 --> 01:28:55,880
What is this confusion for us
early in the morning, guys?

1333
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:57,960
Hey Chotu
- Sir

1334
01:28:58,210 --> 01:28:59,420
Bring Tea. Okay sir

1335
01:28:59,750 --> 01:29:00,590
What is the girls's name?

1336
01:29:01,250 --> 01:29:03,090
Her name is Subbalakshmi , this morning...

1337
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:04,840
Hey, don't forget Ilaichi in the tea

1338
01:29:05,170 --> 01:29:05,880
Ok Sir

1339
01:29:06,250 --> 01:29:08,300
You say yes and idiot,
you get the same tea again

1340
01:29:10,630 --> 01:29:12,300
What's the name?
- Arjun

1341
01:29:12,590 --> 01:29:15,210
Hey, not your name but of that girl
- Subbalakshmi

1342
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:16,710
What's she to you?

1343
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:18,340
She's my friend, actually...

1344
01:29:18,380 --> 01:29:18,960
Sir, Tea

1345
01:29:23,130 --> 01:29:25,590
You've finally achieved. Why did you stop?

1346
01:29:26,250 --> 01:29:27,410
She started yesterday from Prague

1347
01:29:27,700 --> 01:29:30,340
Landed here too, but has still not
reached home and her phone is switched off

1348
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,000
She may have been to her friend's house

1349
01:29:32,750 --> 01:29:33,850
No sir,
we already searched everywhere already.

1350
01:29:34,050 --> 01:29:35,520
By the time we came here...
- Good morning Sir

1351
01:29:37,340 --> 01:29:41,590
What Sankara, said to come in the
night and came after three days.

1352
01:29:41,670 --> 01:29:42,460
What did you do?

1353
01:29:43,170 --> 01:29:47,130
ATM card got broke putting in the pocket Sir.
Went to hometown for bringing a new one.

1354
01:29:47,250 --> 01:29:48,340
Did you bring a new one?

1355
01:29:48,710 --> 01:29:49,550
Yes, I brought Sir
- Sir..

1356
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:52,050
My wife took it saying
to do online shopping Sir

1357
01:29:52,630 --> 01:29:54,090
What work do these ladies have?
- Sir

1358
01:29:54,300 --> 01:29:56,420
One, they fight or they go on buying

1359
01:29:57,340 --> 01:30:01,300
Like his girlfriend is gone missing, it would've
been better if even our wives go missing

1360
01:30:01,420 --> 01:30:02,090
Evet?!

1361
01:30:02,710 --> 01:30:04,800
To hell with him and his outdated jokes

1362
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:07,880
Yes dude, when you give your card so
and what if they swipe at their will?

1363
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:12,380
That's why I set for the OTP
to directly come to my phone

1364
01:30:12,550 --> 01:30:14,460
OTP, what's that dude?

1365
01:30:14,590 --> 01:30:18,750
One Time Password!
can you please get serious about this? Please

1366
01:30:19,130 --> 01:30:20,210
I'm talking about the same right?

1367
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:22,710
Yes dude, what's the story of that OTP?

1368
01:30:23,210 --> 01:30:28,340
If anyone does shopping using our card
details, OTP is needed to complete the bill

1369
01:30:28,750 --> 01:30:29,880
That directly comes to our phone

1370
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:30,590
Oh Yes.

1371
01:30:30,630 --> 01:30:34,960
So, when your wife does shopping
that OTP number comes to your phone

1372
01:30:35,050 --> 01:30:35,500
S

1373
01:30:37,130 --> 01:30:37,920
¡Oh, no!

1374
01:30:39,250 --> 01:30:40,340
Are you guys kidding me?

1375
01:30:40,750 --> 01:30:43,380
When I am tensed as a girl went missing,
you are all speaking as you wish

1376
01:30:44,300 --> 01:30:45,500
Who the hell gave you job, man?

1377
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:47,130
I am going to complain
to the higher authority

1378
01:30:47,170 --> 01:30:48,920
You idiot! Why are you getting serious?

1379
01:30:49,170 --> 01:30:51,500
Even after confusing us getting a different
pic in the morning and another now

1380
01:30:51,550 --> 01:30:52,380
You are again making nuisance?

1381
01:30:52,630 --> 01:30:55,550
If you talk too much, I'll put you in
saying you kidnapped that girl, rascal

1382
01:30:55,590 --> 01:30:57,960
Yes, really? Talk to my lawyer then?
Sir, you please come

1383
01:30:58,340 --> 01:31:00,000
What the hell is he talking sir?
Please come Sir

1384
01:31:00,050 --> 01:31:01,710
Hey
- My phone

1385
01:31:01,750 --> 01:31:03,420
I saw so many lawyers,
get out Come sir, I'll take care

1386
01:31:03,460 --> 01:31:05,130
Make sure he is ruined Get out

1387
01:31:06,590 --> 01:31:09,460
Boss,
it is difficult to get that girl believing us

1388
01:31:10,170 --> 01:31:14,250
They take bribes systematically here but
there will not be filing cases or enquiries

1389
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:17,000
That's why we keep saying stories that
you came in the morning and afternoon

1390
01:31:17,750 --> 01:31:20,050
Still, will there be any two
people looking the same boss?

1391
01:31:20,670 --> 01:31:21,590
What to do now Sankar?

1392
01:31:22,300 --> 01:31:23,420
Where to search for Subbalakshmi?

1393
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:26,340
As far as I know, there would be three
reasons when a girl goes missing.

1394
01:31:26,630 --> 01:31:30,300
One is Kidnap. That option is cancelled as
we didn't get any call for money

1395
01:31:30,920 --> 01:31:31,920
Second is the accident.

1396
01:31:32,210 --> 01:31:34,210
If that had taken place,
we would've got an information by now

1397
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:35,880
Third is trafficking.

1398
01:31:36,630 --> 01:31:40,340
That means forcing girls into prostitution
or selling them abroad

1399
01:31:40,750 --> 01:31:42,920
I feel confident this has taken place, Boss

1400
01:31:43,170 --> 01:31:45,710
Because there is information
that such gangs are in the city

1401
01:31:46,460 --> 01:31:50,750
If you don't save that girl in 48 hours, you
can never see that girl again in your life

1402
01:31:53,750 --> 01:31:54,550
What to do now?

1403
01:31:55,420 --> 01:31:57,090
Nothing should happen to
Subbalakshmi at any cost

1404
01:31:57,460 --> 01:31:59,550
Boss,
as you say the girl hasn't come from airport

1405
01:32:00,060 --> 01:32:02,050
we may get some clue
if we go directly to the airport

1406
01:32:15,380 --> 01:32:19,380
Hey, I heard Laxman saying about some car
accident and a girl involved in the morning

1407
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:20,840
Where would we get that Laxman

1408
01:32:21,130 --> 01:32:24,500
There were three or four, they dashed
my vehicle and left very speed Sir

1409
01:32:27,170 --> 01:32:31,420
Oh no! Hey, who is it rascal?

1410
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:32,550
Hey!

1411
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:38,000
This girl was in that vehicle Sir

1412
01:32:39,630 --> 01:32:40,460
Have you seen the vehicle number?

1413
01:32:41,670 --> 01:32:44,500
What? Has Subbalakshmi gone missing?

1414
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:46,880
Yes dude,
someone kidnapped her at the airport.

1415
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:47,840
We got the vehicle number

1416
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:48,710
I'm checking the details.
- Boss

1417
01:32:49,420 --> 01:32:50,710
I'll call again Ok dude

1418
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:52,920
As per the vehicle number we came to
know that the car was from some Travels

1419
01:32:53,210 --> 01:32:54,250
Vehicle

1420
01:32:54,590 --> 01:32:55,250
What's the nae of the travels?

1421
01:32:55,340 --> 01:32:58,050
Srinivasa travels. 3 Kilometers from here.
- Get into the car, come on

1422
01:33:03,750 --> 01:33:05,840
(Mobile ringing)

1423
01:33:06,130 --> 01:33:09,670
I've been thinking why did my wife still
not start the shopping, Sir. She has started

1424
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:11,880
Yes, say Sridevi

1425
01:33:12,090 --> 01:33:14,380
Not me but should say the OTP

1426
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:17,050
Oh no, what are you buying for 2000?

1427
01:33:17,550 --> 01:33:19,590
I'm buying some broom sticks
as they were coming cheap

1428
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:21,130
Broom sticks costing 2000?

1429
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:24,500
Is it required to buy them online
when we get them in the adjacent shop?

1430
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:27,130
Oh no, I'm buying as there is 50% off.

1431
01:33:27,420 --> 01:33:28,500
Stop the nonsense and say the OTP

1432
01:33:29,880 --> 01:33:30,800
Ok, write
- Tell me

1433
01:33:33,420 --> 01:33:34,380
Lại nữa?

1434
01:33:34,630 --> 01:33:37,550
Yes, 44 idiot and 19. Did you write?

1435
01:33:40,670 --> 01:33:42,320
I don't know whether she sweeps
the house with the broom sticks,

1436
01:33:42,910 --> 01:33:44,610
But is sweeping out all my bank balance Sir

1437
01:33:45,050 --> 01:33:46,460
Sir, there... Stop sir

1438
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:51,130
Sir, this is the vehicle

1439
01:33:54,050 --> 01:33:56,300
I need the details of those who took
the Winger car yesterday for rent

1440
01:33:56,590 --> 01:33:57,880
Who are you to ask that?

1441
01:33:58,130 --> 01:33:59,800
Hello... Police!

1442
01:34:00,210 --> 01:34:01,750
You know Punjagutta Police station?

1443
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:04,840
SI in that station is my cousin.
Do you know that?

1444
01:34:05,420 --> 01:34:07,250
Even the shaved heads
matched and you talk now sir

1445
01:34:09,500 --> 01:34:12,460
We have our sister's marriage in a
week and we need 10 cars for 10 days

1446
01:34:13,630 --> 01:34:14,300
How much would it cost?

1447
01:34:16,590 --> 01:34:18,500
Sir, this is the guy who took
Winger yesterday on rent Sir

1448
01:34:21,130 --> 01:34:22,170
Sir, where is the marriage?

1449
01:34:23,590 --> 01:34:24,090
In Europe

1450
01:34:25,050 --> 01:34:25,460
Wat?

1451
01:34:34,550 --> 01:34:36,710
Not him, he is not the one driving that car

1452
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:37,750
Ho do you know boss?

1453
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:40,750
He is unable to open a bottle how can
he handle the steering in that speed?

1454
01:34:41,090 --> 01:34:42,000
Sir
- Yes

1455
01:34:42,590 --> 01:34:44,050
I'll give you as much as you need

1456
01:34:45,210 --> 01:34:48,520
Accident at the airport,
car taken for rent on your license

1457
01:34:49,020 --> 01:34:50,150
But it wasn't you who drove the car.
Then who was it?

1458
01:34:50,710 --> 01:34:52,000
I don't know Sir

1459
01:34:52,380 --> 01:34:55,380
My work is to give the driving
license and bring the car.

1460
01:34:55,460 --> 01:34:57,550
Another guy drives the car What is his name?

1461
01:34:58,840 --> 01:35:03,800
I don't know name and address,
he always meets at the wine shop at the end

1462
01:35:05,170 --> 01:35:06,130
How does he look?

1463
01:35:09,420 --> 01:35:12,090
girls are directly going to
wine shop and buying drinks

1464
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:16,090
My wife is better, when she feels
like drinking will order online

1465
01:35:16,460 --> 01:35:19,300
Boss, it seems all girls
drink a lot in Europe right?

1466
01:35:21,750 --> 01:35:23,550
There are even those who don't drink.
- Really?

1467
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:31,750
Subbu should drink...

1468
01:35:32,050 --> 01:35:33,500
Subbu should drink...

1469
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:35,920
Whatever you say,
I'll not drink and its final

1470
01:35:36,460 --> 01:35:38,670
Do not overact Subbu, try for once.

1471
01:35:38,840 --> 01:35:41,250
All in front of the eyes will
vanish like a magic is done

1472
01:35:42,340 --> 01:35:43,130
I said to leave right?

1473
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:49,420
One more

1474
01:35:53,420 --> 01:35:56,340
Hey, enough dude.
How much more time will you see?

1475
01:35:57,550 --> 01:35:58,340
10 more minutes dude

1476
01:36:02,250 --> 01:36:02,710
Hi bro,

1477
01:36:04,050 --> 01:36:06,500
A new drug Roast roy from Hyderabad has come

1478
01:36:06,590 --> 01:36:07,550
Will you try?
- No

1479
01:36:08,050 --> 01:36:10,530
Hey, he is just getting
better because of that girl

1480
01:36:10,990 --> 01:36:12,520
You don't bring in new things like drugs.
Get lost

1481
01:36:13,210 --> 01:36:18,050
No problem bro,
if you need the stuff just call me

1482
01:36:18,300 --> 01:36:18,750
Ok, go

1483
01:36:23,250 --> 01:36:24,500
Hey, she saw you

1484
01:36:24,630 --> 01:36:25,750
Yes, she saw me

1485
01:36:27,590 --> 01:36:29,500
Damn, this fellow is come

1486
01:36:33,550 --> 01:36:36,000
Will everything before eyes
vanish having this? Yes

1487
01:37:06,590 --> 01:37:07,800
He is vanished

1488
01:37:10,130 --> 01:37:11,170
Hi Subbu Huh...

1489
01:37:26,550 --> 01:37:28,210
How long will you come so?

1490
01:37:29,670 --> 01:37:30,920
As much far you go

1491
01:37:31,550 --> 01:37:33,960
It's eight Kilometers from here to my house

1492
01:37:35,130 --> 01:37:35,670
I'll come

1493
01:37:38,170 --> 01:37:41,550
Next week if I go to Hyderabad,
it is 8000 Kilometers

1494
01:37:45,590 --> 01:37:46,090
I'll come

1495
01:37:48,420 --> 01:37:51,420
If I'm not seen there after coming

1496
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:55,460
I'll search every house
and street till you're seen

1497
01:37:58,750 --> 01:38:02,130
If I'm dead by the time I'm seen?

1498
01:38:06,750 --> 01:38:07,380
Subbalakshmi

1499
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:11,590
My aunt is mad about music

1500
01:38:12,170 --> 01:38:12,960
Why are you telling that to me?

1501
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:17,170
How did you make 221 girls flat, idiot?

1502
01:38:34,300 --> 01:38:38,130
Boss, as that old man said seeing his
beard and store I think this is the guy

1503
01:38:40,300 --> 01:38:40,840
Are you sure.?

1504
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:42,170
I'm a Police, believe me Boss

1505
01:38:46,170 --> 01:38:46,800
Sorry bro

1506
01:38:47,460 --> 01:38:49,750
Hey, how many times should I say
that I don't know about any girl?

1507
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:51,170
Do not just keep following me.

1508
01:38:53,090 --> 01:38:53,710
He is the guy boss.

1509
01:38:54,550 --> 01:38:56,170
I'm a Police and you should believe me.
Come.

1510
01:39:53,130 --> 01:39:54,420
Suddenly what is this action Boss ?

1511
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:09,500
Boss, not an action but double action

1512
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,840
Just like your faces,
even your problems are the same Boss, how?

1513
01:40:54,130 --> 01:40:59,250
You lazy faced idiot, what if our faces
are same? I'm worried as my girl is missing

1514
01:41:00,050 --> 01:41:02,800
I'll find out where Riya is
even by killing that rascal

1515
01:41:02,920 --> 01:41:04,000
Bro, just wait for a second

1516
01:41:05,750 --> 01:41:07,800
Problems would increase getting
emotional but not be solved.

1517
01:41:08,340 --> 01:41:09,250
We should have a plan

1518
01:41:09,500 --> 01:41:12,130
Are we constructing any bridge on
Swarnamukhi River to draw a plan.

1519
01:41:12,210 --> 01:41:13,210
Where did you find this idiot?

1520
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:16,340
I had been in the morning to Police Station.

1521
01:41:17,050 --> 01:41:20,750
I understood that none would care there
I then directly went to bus stand.

1522
01:41:26,250 --> 01:41:28,840
One, two... Has this girl come here?

1523
01:41:29,590 --> 01:41:30,170
I didn't see

1524
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:33,840
4, 5, 6, 7

1525
01:41:38,340 --> 01:41:39,840
I asked where did she get the chain

1526
01:41:40,670 --> 01:41:41,880
My husband gave it

1527
01:41:42,090 --> 01:41:43,300
I went to her husband

1528
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:45,210
Sir, he gave it

1529
01:41:46,710 --> 01:41:48,050
I went to Seth from there

1530
01:41:49,710 --> 01:41:50,670
That Seth... Wait..

1531
01:41:51,590 --> 01:41:53,500
why did you go to Seth from her husband?

1532
01:41:55,500 --> 01:41:56,710
I forgot the kid in between

1533
01:41:58,130 --> 01:41:59,460
I don't know anything sir.

1534
01:41:59,750 --> 01:42:02,590
I went to Seth for giving tea and
picked it up without Seth's knowledge

1535
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:04,090
I clearly asked that Seth

1536
01:42:05,250 --> 01:42:07,340
He is the guy who mortgaged your chain Sir

1537
01:42:08,460 --> 01:42:09,960
What is coming an hour before?

1538
01:42:10,420 --> 01:42:12,340
What chain and what girl, I know nothing.

1539
01:42:16,130 --> 01:42:19,000
I hunted for this guy and is found here

1540
01:42:19,590 --> 01:42:23,420
Ok Boss, that Seth,
Tea shop guy and the lady at bus stand...

1541
01:42:23,670 --> 01:42:25,380
Why did they all say the
truth when you asked?

1542
01:42:27,210 --> 01:42:28,130
They didn't say when I asked

1543
01:42:34,210 --> 01:42:37,000
His flashback is filled with
more bashing than sorrow

1544
01:42:39,210 --> 01:42:40,750
Both of you relax boss.

1545
01:42:41,130 --> 01:42:44,670
See how I would make him say
the truth using my experience

1546
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:46,050
Just watch!

1547
01:42:49,050 --> 01:42:49,840
Where are the girls?

1548
01:42:50,670 --> 01:42:51,550
I don't know.

1549
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:57,840
Boss, you may faint seeing
the treatment I give him now.

1550
01:42:58,050 --> 01:42:59,380
Please keep distance

1551
01:43:02,920 --> 01:43:06,710
Say where the girls are else I'll poke this

1552
01:43:07,420 --> 01:43:08,250
I don't know.

1553
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:10,250
I'm poking

1554
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:12,000
I'm saying I don't know right?

1555
01:43:13,670 --> 01:43:16,710
I'll poke.
- Hey, are you any deaf?

1556
01:43:18,260 --> 01:43:20,650
Hey!
- Aah!

1557
01:43:23,550 --> 01:43:24,590
Oh no, blood!

1558
01:43:28,670 --> 01:43:32,750
When war comes you should do
the war but not recite a poem

1559
01:43:34,300 --> 01:43:35,210
Hey idiot, where are they?

1560
01:43:36,500 --> 01:43:40,000
I've no relation with those trafficking guys

1561
01:43:40,300 --> 01:43:44,380
When I'm asking about the girls, why are you
talking about some traffic and pollution rascal?

1562
01:43:46,420 --> 01:43:47,800
Bro... Bro.. Bro..

1563
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:52,210
Trafficking means illegal business,

1564
01:43:54,300 --> 01:43:55,500
what they are doing is women trafficking

1565
01:43:57,300 --> 01:44:01,550
That means forcing girls into prostitution

1566
01:44:05,210 --> 01:44:10,380
If we don't trace out the girls in the next 43
hours, it seems we can never find them again

1567
01:44:16,920 --> 01:44:21,590
Hey, I never expected would get a
situation in my life to kill a person

1568
01:44:22,590 --> 01:44:24,750
I'm telling you now, remember this.

1569
01:44:26,130 --> 01:44:30,170
Every person involved in this
will not be left alive

1570
01:44:30,550 --> 01:44:34,050
Sir believe me, I'm just a driver.

1571
01:44:34,250 --> 01:44:36,550
I pick up and drop where they ask to drop

1572
01:44:36,920 --> 01:44:38,880
They deal everything
over the cell phone Sir.

1573
01:44:39,250 --> 01:44:41,210
We keep waiting for the phone

1574
01:44:41,590 --> 01:44:45,130
We don't get their number in the phone Sir.
Amount is deposited every month in the account

1575
01:44:45,800 --> 01:44:48,840
I know nothing more than this Sir, please...

1576
01:44:54,550 --> 01:44:55,340
What are you doing bro?

1577
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:57,250
Second leg is free right?

1578
01:44:57,840 --> 01:44:59,130
I'm seeing what will fit in

1579
01:44:59,380 --> 01:45:05,000
Sir, I heard them speaking
about the train factory under repair twice

1580
01:45:18,830 --> 01:45:21,040
I know that they operate
and fix rod in the leg

1581
01:45:21,370 --> 01:45:23,290
but I'm seeing for the first
time pushing the rod directly

1582
01:45:24,040 --> 01:45:25,620
We should be very careful with this fellow,
boss

1583
01:45:26,580 --> 01:45:30,040
If by chance I get confused and go with him,
please alert me Boss

1584
01:45:33,200 --> 01:45:36,000
How did you get my phone?
- What's the name of this girl?

1585
01:45:38,410 --> 01:45:39,160
Subbalakshmi

1586
01:45:40,160 --> 01:45:43,580
She looks pure in looks and
how did she fall for you?

1587
01:45:50,330 --> 01:45:53,200
You look like a stupid and has
that Riya not fallen for you?

1588
01:45:54,450 --> 01:45:55,290
What's he saying?

1589
01:46:03,870 --> 01:46:07,000
We searched all the railway godowns in
the city and this is the final one left

1590
01:46:07,410 --> 01:46:10,330
But this is closed from 10 years,
no chance for them to be here

1591
01:46:10,870 --> 01:46:12,700
That driver has cheated us Boss

1592
01:46:13,580 --> 01:46:18,410
If only I'm able to listen to the song,
they are here for sure

1593
01:46:18,910 --> 01:46:22,080
Looks like she would not leave shopping
even in the midnight. My wife boss...

1594
01:46:22,450 --> 01:46:24,750
Why here when there is none?
We are already running out of time.

1595
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:25,540
Let's go!

1596
01:46:26,500 --> 01:46:29,500
I'm going in.
You follow if you wish to or no

1597
01:46:29,750 --> 01:46:31,660
Not that, listen to me

1598
01:46:31,870 --> 01:46:34,910
In the epics, Arjuna listened to Krishna
but not Krishna didn't listen to Arjuna

1599
01:46:34,950 --> 01:46:35,580
OK

1600
01:46:35,950 --> 01:46:38,830
Only the Police know how to open
the closed locks. You wait here

1601
01:46:39,330 --> 01:46:42,950
In such times,
a solid rod and a hook at the end...

1602
01:46:46,580 --> 01:46:49,080
We'll have no use of tools
if he is with us boss

1603
01:46:49,830 --> 01:46:50,580
Sposta

1604
01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:30,700
They've definitely brought the
girls here and shifted somewhere

1605
01:47:31,080 --> 01:47:32,200
Where would they have shift?

1606
01:47:35,660 --> 01:47:37,290
Boss, someone is coming.

1607
01:47:37,790 --> 01:47:38,290
Hide

1608
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:40,910
Krishna...

1609
01:47:46,750 --> 01:47:49,830
(Mobile Ringing)

1610
01:47:51,040 --> 01:47:51,790
Hi.

1611
01:47:51,870 --> 01:47:55,120
Hey, I'm in an important mission

1612
01:47:55,750 --> 01:47:58,450
I'm on the job of buying washing machine,
say the OTP

1613
01:47:59,580 --> 01:48:02,250
Sridevi,
understand the situation in which I am

1614
01:48:02,700 --> 01:48:06,750
My hands are going red washing the clothes.
You try to understand my situation.

1615
01:48:07,080 --> 01:48:07,870
Say the OTP

1616
01:48:08,330 --> 01:48:10,250
Ok, write
- Yes

1617
01:48:15,200 --> 01:48:15,950
I didn't listen

1618
01:48:19,200 --> 01:48:21,290
Come on, say a bit loud

1619
01:48:21,580 --> 01:48:25,120
You rascal, 542754 ok?

1620
01:48:26,660 --> 01:48:29,750
Why do you say so slowly hubby?
Time is up by the time I typed

1621
01:48:35,330 --> 01:48:37,080
Even my time is up here

1622
01:48:40,330 --> 01:48:41,870
How many more guys are there, rascals?

1623
01:48:46,250 --> 01:48:49,290
Police..Police.. Hey Brother..run..
police has come

1624
01:48:50,120 --> 01:48:53,450
Hey, move fast... careful with him.

1625
01:48:53,580 --> 01:48:55,370
Run..run fast...

1626
01:48:56,910 --> 01:48:59,910
Hey, start the vehicle...come on sit..

1627
01:49:00,250 --> 01:49:02,250
Hey, move fast..move.

1628
01:49:13,950 --> 01:49:15,620
Hey kill him... come on kill

1629
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:18,660
Drive over him

1630
01:49:23,870 --> 01:49:26,500
Don't leave him...speed up.

1631
01:49:55,870 --> 01:49:56,700
We lost them

1632
01:49:58,540 --> 01:49:59,500
Did you lose your mind?

1633
01:49:59,910 --> 01:50:02,000
If I was one minute late,
you would've been dead

1634
01:50:02,250 --> 01:50:05,500
I'm ready either to die or kill for Riya

1635
01:50:05,790 --> 01:50:09,120
Is only your girlfriend in danger?
It's very easy to die or kill

1636
01:50:09,410 --> 01:50:11,500
First you should be safe for you to get Riya

1637
01:50:16,160 --> 01:50:18,830
It all has happened because of
this waste fellow's phone ringing

1638
01:50:19,290 --> 01:50:20,290
I should hit him with slipper

1639
01:50:20,620 --> 01:50:22,370
Do they hit with steps too?

1640
01:50:22,910 --> 01:50:25,620
Girls Colleges, shopping Mall,
software companies, and Sultan Bazar...

1641
01:50:25,790 --> 01:50:28,700
One common thing at all these places
is girls being very huge in number

1642
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:30,910
Their attempt maybe at
any one of these places

1643
01:50:31,410 --> 01:50:34,950
But there are many Girls Colleges and software
companies in Hyderabad, where can we search for?

1644
01:50:36,450 --> 01:50:39,790
This time it is not us going to
them but let's make them come to us

1645
01:50:41,120 --> 01:50:41,580
Como?

1646
01:50:41,950 --> 01:50:45,950
If I do a concert, there will be a huge
turnout of teenagers.. especially girls

1647
01:50:46,620 --> 01:50:47,750
They would definitely try out

1648
01:50:49,200 --> 01:50:50,790
Will they attempt after so much happened?

1649
01:50:51,330 --> 01:50:53,700
It is written inside that 10
more girls are needed on the 11th

1650
01:50:54,200 --> 01:50:57,620
That means they need 10 more girls tomorrow,
I think they will definitely come

1651
01:50:58,080 --> 01:50:59,120
Super Idea boss

1652
01:50:59,370 --> 01:51:02,450
He saying it and you believing
like a mad sheep, it is great

1653
01:51:02,790 --> 01:51:05,200
It took me 25 years to make a girl flat

1654
01:51:05,580 --> 01:51:09,750
And all girls come in crowds if he
sings a song with the same face it seems

1655
01:51:10,040 --> 01:51:11,290
Is this something that can happen?

1656
01:51:11,750 --> 01:51:14,290
Dude, you know what Sigmund
Freud said in such situations?

1657
01:51:14,660 --> 01:51:16,290
What is that shame and fraud?

1658
01:51:19,370 --> 01:51:20,750
I should urgently call Mridanga Rao

1659
01:51:29,950 --> 01:51:31,450
Sir, tell me sir

1660
01:51:31,700 --> 01:51:33,330
We are doing a concert tomorrow in
the morning urgently in Hyderabad

1661
01:51:34,200 --> 01:51:37,410
Overnight arrangements should be made
across social media and everywhere

1662
01:51:37,950 --> 01:51:39,290
Update the details immediately

1663
01:51:39,410 --> 01:51:40,750
Sir, done sir

1664
01:51:46,250 --> 01:51:49,080
Mirchi 98.3,
this is very hot Boss and I am Sameer

1665
01:51:49,200 --> 01:51:53,620
Rock star Arjun's concert is starting
in a few hours from now in Hyderabad

1666
01:53:03,250 --> 01:53:09,910
"The thundering heart"

1667
01:53:10,160 --> 01:53:15,870
"Let the heart that is
like a cyclone shower fire"

1668
01:53:16,830 --> 01:53:22,580
"If you are not like my shadow,
I am nowhere"

1669
01:53:23,790 --> 01:53:30,790
"The thundering heart
does not let me be stable"

1670
01:53:31,250 --> 01:53:37,830
"The chasing heart does
not even let me blink"

1671
01:53:38,290 --> 01:53:45,080
"I searched like a sky and
am left as breath for you"

1672
01:53:45,290 --> 01:53:51,950
"My world has long become yours
and the loneliness waits for you"

1673
01:53:53,120 --> 01:53:59,330
"When the remembrances are poking the tender heart"

1674
01:54:00,120 --> 01:54:06,250
"A new life gave a pleasure of touching you"

1675
01:54:06,450 --> 01:54:12,870
"You are ready for war
and I am the weapon inside you"

1676
01:54:13,580 --> 01:54:20,000
"You are the concentration and destination,
I have no doubts"

1677
01:54:20,290 --> 01:54:26,870
"Come on move, in a pace of the cyclone...
Move on"

1678
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:33,330
"It's just the clanking
sounds of victory in this way"

1679
01:54:33,500 --> 01:54:41,080
"Hey running age, reach the shore
of my love becoming the breathe"

1680
01:54:41,250 --> 01:54:48,120
"Shout aloud this story
of love like world hears"

1681
01:55:02,290 --> 01:55:09,290
"The thundering heart
does not let me be stable"

1682
01:55:09,370 --> 01:55:16,330
"The chasing heart does
not even let me blink"

1683
01:55:16,410 --> 01:55:23,200
"I searched like a sky and
am left as breath for you"

1684
01:55:23,410 --> 01:55:30,080
"My world has long become yours
and the loneliness waits for you"

1685
01:55:58,370 --> 01:56:05,200
"The thundering heart
does not let me be stable"

1686
01:56:05,290 --> 01:56:12,250
"The chasing heart does
not even let me blink"

1687
01:56:12,450 --> 01:56:19,250
"I searched like a sky and
am left as breath for you"

1688
01:56:19,410 --> 01:56:30,200
"My world has long become yours
and the loneliness waits for you"

1689
01:56:34,080 --> 01:56:39,200
"The loneliness waits for you"

1690
01:56:53,200 --> 01:56:53,620
chony

1691
01:57:01,120 --> 01:57:03,370
One escaped and this
fellow died in his hands

1692
01:57:06,330 --> 01:57:10,330
You ruined the whole plan made.
The only clue left too... Damn

1693
01:57:11,910 --> 01:57:14,870
I did not kill going crazy, it happened so

1694
01:57:15,250 --> 01:57:16,660
Has it happened so?

1695
01:57:17,160 --> 01:57:19,370
Listen, I am saying now and
you'll never get that Riya

1696
01:57:20,700 --> 01:57:24,660
I will not remain a human if
you say such dangerous words

1697
01:57:24,790 --> 01:57:26,290
Who is saying you are a human now?

1698
01:57:26,790 --> 01:57:29,120
I don't understand how that
girl loved a wild animal like you

1699
01:57:31,120 --> 01:57:33,410
Hey, take him aside.

1700
01:57:33,870 --> 01:57:36,450
I killed that fellow unexpectedly and
I'll kill this fellow purposefully

1701
01:57:36,750 --> 01:57:38,790
Kill me dude, you know only that right?

1702
01:57:39,250 --> 01:57:42,000
Sankar, I'm sure that girl would be
happy there than with this fellow

1703
01:57:42,330 --> 01:57:43,410
It's better she is not found to him

1704
01:57:48,830 --> 01:57:50,200
Boss,
how much time do you think is still left?

1705
01:57:50,500 --> 01:57:53,160
If you keep fighting so, they would
make the girls cross the borders there

1706
01:57:53,370 --> 01:57:54,540
Then it's a waste whatever we do

1707
01:58:01,540 --> 01:58:03,370
It's impossible to find them
out along with such a fool.

1708
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:05,580
You die anywhere, I don't care

1709
01:58:22,750 --> 01:58:23,950
Gani...is the work done

1710
01:58:24,410 --> 01:58:25,160
Hey!

1711
01:58:26,580 --> 01:58:29,200
I don't know whether you're
understanding my language or not

1712
01:58:30,120 --> 01:58:32,290
But remember, I am saying one thing

1713
01:58:34,120 --> 01:58:41,290
Whoever you are and wherever you are, a death
unseen by anyone till date is waiting for you

1714
01:58:50,580 --> 01:58:51,950
Someone killed Gani

1715
01:58:52,200 --> 01:58:52,790
Gani?

1716
01:58:55,160 --> 01:58:56,580
Is it a Police? No

1717
01:58:58,660 --> 01:59:02,870
The guy who can reach
Gani can even come here

1718
01:59:03,410 --> 01:59:06,410
His plan is something different.
That is why he is following us

1719
01:59:09,290 --> 01:59:12,540
Do one thing, split all the girls

1720
01:59:13,580 --> 01:59:16,370
Go in two different vehicles
and in two different routes

1721
01:59:16,950 --> 01:59:19,540
And as per the plan, leave two hours early

1722
01:59:21,250 --> 01:59:26,160
And if he comes in the way, kill him

1723
01:59:34,450 --> 01:59:35,290
Brother
- Tell me Madam

1724
01:59:35,330 --> 01:59:40,160
Bring Samosas, egg puffs, Badam milks
from canteen and give them to everyone

1725
01:59:40,200 --> 01:59:40,660
Ok madam

1726
01:59:40,700 --> 01:59:42,620
What is special dear, is it your birthday?

1727
01:59:43,370 --> 01:59:45,040
No birthday nothing,

1728
01:59:45,330 --> 01:59:50,250
It's been one month since the guy Krishna who
continuously called to our call center and tortured

1729
01:59:50,330 --> 01:59:52,660
That is why this party is, let's celebrate

1730
01:59:54,870 --> 01:59:59,290
Hello welcome to Airvoice, we request
you to say your name and phone number

1731
01:59:59,700 --> 02:00:00,950
It's me dear, I'm Krishna calling

1732
02:00:03,870 --> 02:00:05,120
Brother
- Tell me madam

1733
02:00:05,160 --> 02:00:07,540
Cancel all the Egg puffs,
Badam Milk and everything

1734
02:00:07,800 --> 02:00:08,350
Ok madam

1735
02:00:08,750 --> 02:00:10,410
What rascal, did you start again?

1736
02:00:10,910 --> 02:00:12,080
I did not call for that now,

1737
02:00:12,660 --> 02:00:14,500
You should tell me where is the
guy with the number I say

1738
02:00:14,750 --> 02:00:16,160
Such an information will not be given here,
bye

1739
02:00:16,660 --> 02:00:17,870
Hey girl, do not cut the phone

1740
02:00:20,040 --> 02:00:22,120
A girl like you is in
danger on the other side

1741
02:00:22,910 --> 02:00:24,540
Please say details of that
number and it's a help from you

1742
02:00:25,750 --> 02:00:27,830
Ok, I'll say but one condition.

1743
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:29,910
You should never call here again in life

1744
02:00:30,250 --> 02:00:32,250
I'll never call in my life.
- Ok, tell the number

1745
02:00:33,040 --> 02:00:35,660
Name of that girl is Pranitha and it
seems she was beside a road unconscious

1746
02:00:35,790 --> 02:00:38,410
This definitely would be a deed of
that trafficking guys, this is the room

1747
02:00:42,080 --> 02:00:44,870
Oh no, they killed so cruelly

1748
02:00:44,910 --> 02:00:45,410
Doctor.

1749
02:00:45,750 --> 02:00:48,160
She died due to high dosage of drugs

1750
02:00:48,790 --> 02:00:52,160
As the girl was very weak,
she couldn't withstand drug effect

1751
02:00:53,540 --> 02:00:56,790
They threw her roadside knowing
that this girl will not be alive

1752
02:01:07,160 --> 02:01:11,450
Traffickers use this drug to
numb the brain function of girls

1753
02:01:11,790 --> 02:01:16,410
Poor girls will not know how many and
what they are doing when this drug is used

1754
02:01:17,790 --> 02:01:20,910
They turn them slaves and ruin the life

1755
02:01:21,500 --> 02:01:26,700
Using this drug repeatedly, mental trauma
occurs and they come into a suicidal tendency

1756
02:01:27,040 --> 02:01:29,040
What more would be a hell for a girl?

1757
02:01:29,500 --> 02:01:33,500
The only good happening to this
girl is that she died early

1758
02:01:36,160 --> 02:01:39,370
If not, it is very tough to bear that pain

1759
02:01:39,580 --> 02:01:40,700
What's the name of that drug Doctor?

1760
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:41,870
Scopolamine

1761
02:01:42,200 --> 02:01:45,660
This is called Roast Roy
and is available very rarely

1762
02:01:50,830 --> 02:01:51,660
Roast roy!

1763
02:01:52,580 --> 02:01:53,250
Tell me dude

1764
02:01:53,500 --> 02:01:55,750
You remember, a guy tried selling
us a drug called Roast roy?

1765
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:56,620
When is it?

1766
02:01:56,830 --> 02:01:58,750
Hey, we had been that night to pub
for seeing Subbalakshmi, right?

1767
02:01:59,750 --> 02:02:02,370
A new drug 'Roast Roy'
from Hyderabad has come

1768
02:02:03,450 --> 02:02:06,660
I need all details from where that
came and who is dealing urgently

1769
02:02:06,870 --> 02:02:08,200
Ok, dude

1770
02:02:10,080 --> 02:02:10,830
Tell me Arjun

1771
02:02:11,200 --> 02:02:15,540
Hey, I'll do a concert for
your NGOs once I come to Europe

1772
02:02:15,910 --> 02:02:18,200
Thank you dude, thank you so much

1773
02:02:18,620 --> 02:02:20,950
Sorry dude, for talking that way

1774
02:02:29,660 --> 02:02:33,660
Hello, the number you said was operated
20 minutes earlier from Shaikpet

1775
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,830
But I cannot say the location exactly
now as it is switched off

1776
02:02:37,540 --> 02:02:39,410
Shaikpet... Thanks dear

1777
02:02:40,160 --> 02:02:41,000
Drive to Shaikpet brother

1778
02:02:43,620 --> 02:02:44,250
Drive fast brother

1779
02:02:49,040 --> 02:02:52,370
Roast roy, say whom and where
all you sold this drug in bulk

1780
02:02:52,540 --> 02:02:54,500
Say the truth else I'll kill you right now

1781
02:02:54,790 --> 02:02:56,750
I gave twice in Balanagar Sir.

1782
02:02:57,080 --> 02:02:59,120
But I gave in Puaranapul for most times Sir

1783
02:02:59,540 --> 02:03:01,330
Where in Puranapul?

1784
02:03:09,790 --> 02:03:10,870
I saw this name somewhere?

1785
02:03:11,410 --> 02:03:12,250
In the train at night...

1786
02:03:13,080 --> 02:03:13,620
Stop brother

1787
02:03:29,750 --> 02:03:33,500
I came to your concert and tried meeting you,
but I couldn't

1788
02:03:33,660 --> 02:03:37,700
If you were late in coming, they would've
got me married to that waste rascal

1789
02:03:37,830 --> 02:03:39,040
Come on, we will go
- Who are you girl?

1790
02:03:39,700 --> 02:03:40,330
Where to go?

1791
02:03:40,660 --> 02:03:42,040
Why is your language so?

1792
02:03:42,160 --> 02:03:43,830
This is not the time for practical jokes,
move

1793
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:45,330
What is your nuisance girl?

1794
02:03:45,830 --> 02:03:47,910
I am saying I don't know who you are,
go aside

1795
02:03:48,750 --> 02:03:52,200
Arjun, please stop it.
Take me before my people see.

1796
02:03:52,620 --> 02:03:53,620
Oh, his property?

1797
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,250
I'm not Arjun as you think
but my name is Krishna

1798
02:03:56,910 --> 02:04:01,450
Don't talk silly Arjun, please.
Are you now taking me away or not?

1799
02:04:01,500 --> 02:04:03,750
Am I an eagle or you are
any chick to take away?

1800
02:04:03,910 --> 02:04:04,500
Go away from here

1801
02:04:04,950 --> 02:04:07,620
Please Arjun@
- Why do you hold me so like a python?

1802
02:04:07,910 --> 02:04:09,330
Leave, leave me girl.

1803
02:04:10,410 --> 02:04:15,200
I cannot be without you Arjun.
I love you Arjun, take me from here

1804
02:04:15,250 --> 02:04:16,870
Hey...
- Yes..Daddy.

1805
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:18,500
Please Arjun

1806
02:04:18,700 --> 02:04:19,330
Leave me

1807
02:04:19,870 --> 02:04:20,500
Please!
- Leave me

1808
02:04:20,750 --> 02:04:23,450
Nikky, what's happening?

1809
02:04:23,790 --> 02:04:24,700
My boyfriend

1810
02:04:25,160 --> 02:04:26,540
Uncle, what's happening?

1811
02:04:26,700 --> 02:04:28,870
Nikky, move without playing crazy tricks

1812
02:04:29,080 --> 02:04:32,950
Dad, I'll marry only Arjun.
I don't need this horse faced idiot

1813
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:33,660
Hello!

1814
02:04:33,870 --> 02:04:36,000
Don't frustrate me,
my name is Krishna and not Arjun

1815
02:04:36,290 --> 02:04:39,950
I know your perfume smell too correctly,
don't try to cheat me

1816
02:04:40,410 --> 02:04:41,790
Mother in law, what's happening?

1817
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,700
What's this drama having marriage
in an hour? Leave him first

1818
02:04:45,040 --> 02:04:47,080
Mom, you don't anything, you be quiet

1819
02:04:47,250 --> 02:04:50,660
Hey, you're mistaken as I and
Arjun look alike. Leave me

1820
02:04:50,700 --> 02:04:51,250
Arjun

1821
02:04:51,660 --> 02:04:56,120
You think I'll believe if you say not to be
Arjun even after spending three nights with you?

1822
02:04:56,290 --> 02:04:59,330
Dad, what's happening?
- Your fate is happening

1823
02:04:59,450 --> 02:05:02,410
Have you still not understood
how bad their family is?

1824
02:05:02,500 --> 02:05:05,700
Brother in law, I'll not keep quiet
if you talk bad about my family

1825
02:05:05,750 --> 02:05:06,700
What will you do?

1826
02:05:06,870 --> 02:05:07,580
I'll teach you a lesson
- What'll you do?

1827
02:05:07,700 --> 02:05:10,330
What are you talking..? What'll you do?

1828
02:05:18,450 --> 02:05:20,580
Boss, I think they are taking away the girls

1829
02:05:28,410 --> 02:05:30,080
Shankar, you go that side
- Ok Boss

1830
02:05:50,910 --> 02:05:52,000
Catch that fellow

1831
02:06:18,500 --> 02:06:22,160
What Krishna, you think I cannot
catch you when roaming freely in city

1832
02:06:24,580 --> 02:06:26,160
Why are you shaking the head so, idiot?

1833
02:06:26,790 --> 02:06:31,080
Since you hit me in the village, I lived
heniously without even able to eat food

1834
02:06:31,620 --> 02:06:35,410
And you are roaming joyfully
changing a dress daily here?

1835
02:06:37,120 --> 02:06:40,160
I already called your friends
to come and take your body

1836
02:06:40,950 --> 02:06:42,700
Just killing you is left out now

1837
02:06:44,120 --> 02:06:44,750
Hey!

1838
02:07:59,330 --> 02:08:05,500
How did you think him as Krishna as
both faces look alike, you son of an MLA?

1839
02:08:07,040 --> 02:08:13,080
Our whole village knows that Krishna would always
face such things but never runs away right?

1840
02:08:15,120 --> 02:08:20,120
My body is already on fire
and if say a fight now..

1841
02:08:20,910 --> 02:08:27,620
You will not just have one but both the hands
to eat Biryani at Seenaiah mess in our village

1842
02:08:30,040 --> 02:08:31,790
Hey, where are you going idiot?

1843
02:08:32,540 --> 02:08:33,660
What is he speaking?

1844
02:08:34,120 --> 02:08:36,040
How can I be without eating
BIryani in Seenaiah mess?

1845
02:08:36,330 --> 02:08:37,870
I cannot be. I'm going

1846
02:08:37,950 --> 02:08:38,410
Hey!

1847
02:08:40,870 --> 02:08:43,040
Hey, kill him

1848
02:09:32,200 --> 02:09:35,250
It's correct to push the cloth
in mouth for your blabbering

1849
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:42,370
Who are all those? Why do they want to kill
you? Can't you be fighting with anybody?

1850
02:09:44,660 --> 02:09:47,910
I have never seen a brainless fellow like
you in life. I would've been dead if delayed.

1851
02:09:48,620 --> 02:09:49,830
I wish I could kill you.

1852
02:09:52,750 --> 02:09:57,370
How did your heart agree to catch the
collar of the guy who saved your life?

1853
02:09:57,720 --> 02:10:01,830
Hey, when I almost caught the van with
Subbalakshmi in, they came and spoilt that.

1854
02:10:01,950 --> 02:10:02,750
It's all because of you

1855
02:10:04,410 --> 02:10:06,370
Subbalakshmi is not there
in the van you're thinking

1856
02:10:06,500 --> 02:10:09,790
What are you saying idiot?
How do you know that she is not in that?

1857
02:12:28,620 --> 02:12:29,120
Hey..

1858
02:12:32,580 --> 02:12:33,160
Girl!

1859
02:12:35,120 --> 02:12:36,910
Subbalakshmi... Girl..

1860
02:12:43,910 --> 02:12:45,580
Dude, where are you?

1861
02:12:45,870 --> 02:12:50,580
Our MLA's son called and said he is killing you
in Vikarabad forest and I am calling in fear

1862
02:12:50,790 --> 02:12:53,370
Why would MLA's son kill me,
I'm fine and you cut the phone

1863
02:12:59,410 --> 02:13:00,040
Arjun...

1864
02:13:01,330 --> 02:13:02,370
That means... Subbalakshmi..

1865
02:13:48,250 --> 02:13:50,410
Would you come any distance for me?

1866
02:13:51,790 --> 02:13:52,410
I'll come

1867
02:13:54,250 --> 02:13:55,540
Would you come anywhere?

1868
02:13:56,910 --> 02:13:57,700
I will come

1869
02:13:58,290 --> 02:14:00,040
What if I was not seen there?

1870
02:14:02,330 --> 02:14:06,410
I'll search every street and
every house till you're seen

1871
02:14:16,790 --> 02:14:20,040
What if was dead by then?

1872
02:14:26,080 --> 02:14:30,330
Then I'll adjust with some Michelle or Jessy

1873
02:14:54,200 --> 02:14:57,370
Boss, there is information that the
courier service vehicle is going to Goa

1874
02:15:03,500 --> 02:15:06,910
Shankar called.. I should go to Goa

1875
02:15:07,290 --> 02:15:08,080
Why Goa?

1876
02:15:09,120 --> 02:15:12,830
I heard them talking about
some Goa and Dubai ship

1877
02:15:14,290 --> 02:15:14,910
I too will come

1878
02:15:15,200 --> 02:15:16,580
Why the unnecessary troubles for you?

1879
02:15:17,200 --> 02:15:19,500
Go home peacefully. One thing...

1880
02:15:21,790 --> 02:15:24,040
My mother would be waiting
for me at home in the village.

1881
02:15:25,580 --> 02:15:30,580
By chance, if I don't come back..
Keep visiting her often.

1882
02:15:32,080 --> 02:15:34,290
Poor lady would feel
happy thinking you as me

1883
02:15:40,410 --> 02:15:42,620
Nothing will happen to you Krishna,
we too will come

1884
02:15:47,540 --> 02:15:49,290
Come on, let us go and get Riya

1885
02:16:01,200 --> 02:16:03,080
When did you meet Riya
for the last time Krishna?

1886
02:16:25,500 --> 02:16:41,160
"As she has come,
did the air turn into colors?"

1887
02:16:42,080 --> 02:16:49,450
"The village breeze turned into this
babe and has she hug me like breathe?"

1888
02:16:50,160 --> 02:16:57,290
"When I am alone, I cannot bear
and this is never experienced pain"

1889
02:16:57,790 --> 02:17:05,500
"A century away would also
turn as the moment of meeting"

1890
02:17:05,830 --> 02:17:13,250
"Though am alone, I am inside the heart"

1891
02:17:13,290 --> 02:17:17,120
"The moonlight with no
scars has come on to the earth"

1892
02:17:17,250 --> 02:17:21,200
"It has kissed the dried out
heart and shared love"

1893
02:17:21,250 --> 02:17:25,080
"The moonlight with no
scars has come on to the earth"

1894
02:17:25,200 --> 02:17:29,160
"It has kissed the dried out
heart and shared love"

1895
02:17:29,450 --> 02:17:43,410
"You are my way and I came longing for you"

1896
02:18:01,450 --> 02:18:09,200
"Will the morning stop as it is
dark and rain stop as it is far"

1897
02:18:09,540 --> 02:18:17,250
"Will the flowers not blossom as branch is
blocking, will dream stop as it is in sleep"

1898
02:18:17,290 --> 02:18:33,290
"I opened the eyes and called in dream,
I won you and stood for you"

1899
02:18:37,250 --> 02:18:45,120
"This is the thick moonlight behind the curtain of
eyelids. It left increasing the beat of the heart"

1900
02:18:45,250 --> 02:18:52,910
"This is the thick moonlight behind the curtain of
eyelids. It left increasing the beat of the heart"

1901
02:18:53,040 --> 02:19:08,370
"You are my way and I came longing for you"

1902
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:40,960
Bro, the ship that goes to Dubai from here...

1903
02:19:41,300 --> 02:19:42,630
Ship to Dubai?
- Yes

1904
02:19:43,050 --> 02:19:44,340
That left two hours ago sir

1905
02:19:47,420 --> 02:19:48,050
What is he saying?

1906
02:19:48,920 --> 02:19:51,500
It seems it left two hours ago.
That's the one for sure

1907
02:19:53,550 --> 02:19:56,630
Two hours means it would've
gone very far, what to do now?

1908
02:20:03,050 --> 02:20:03,880
Excuse me
- Yes?

1909
02:20:03,920 --> 02:20:05,210
It's an emergency and I need your yacht

1910
02:20:06,500 --> 02:20:08,000
Oh, this is my private yacht

1911
02:20:08,460 --> 02:20:09,420
I can buy it off actually

1912
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:14,590
Do you know what's the cost? 15 Crores

1913
02:20:17,670 --> 02:20:22,300
15 Crores? everything you earned till
date summed will not be 15 Crores dude

1914
02:20:22,550 --> 02:20:26,300
I don't know whether you take advances for
concerts, take loans or sell our properties.

1915
02:20:27,130 --> 02:20:28,550
But the money should be
transferred in 5 minutes

1916
02:20:31,870 --> 02:20:38,200
"You are ready for war
and I am the weapon inside you"

1917
02:20:38,660 --> 02:20:45,030
"You are the concentration and destination,
I have no doubts"

1918
02:20:45,490 --> 02:20:51,630
"Come on move, in a pace of the cyclone...
Move on"

1919
02:20:52,700 --> 02:20:58,280
"It is just the clanking
sounds of victory in this way"

1920
02:20:59,030 --> 02:21:06,050
"Hey running age, reach the shore
of my love becoming the breathe"

1921
02:21:06,490 --> 02:21:13,630
"Shout aloud this story
of love like world hears"

1922
02:21:21,890 --> 02:21:22,410
Come Arjun

1923
02:21:23,250 --> 02:21:26,340
We started to Dubai and the girls
this time are great. Maximum...

1924
02:21:30,630 --> 02:21:33,880
Krishna,
you go this way and we'll see on the deck

1925
02:22:11,170 --> 02:22:13,000
He is the guy who killed our
fellow at the concert.

1926
02:22:13,460 --> 02:22:14,630
He is very dangerous bro

1927
02:22:37,920 --> 02:22:40,170
First that MLA's son and then this fellow

1928
02:22:43,090 --> 02:22:45,090
Hold it properly,
he'll not understand all these

1929
02:23:20,800 --> 02:23:24,670
Hey, who are you and how
did you enter the ship?

1930
02:23:25,630 --> 02:23:27,210
You didn't inform the Police right?

1931
02:23:28,670 --> 02:23:30,090
How many more are with you?

1932
02:23:30,670 --> 02:23:32,960
Where is Riya, rascal?

1933
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,170
It was the same guy who spoke
to me on the phone right?

1934
02:23:37,750 --> 02:23:40,920
Hey listen,
it's just a business and nothing personal

1935
02:23:41,800 --> 02:23:45,710
So, say for which girl are you
here and I'll hand over to you

1936
02:23:47,250 --> 02:23:51,420
After that you will go
your way and I'll go mine.

1937
02:23:51,630 --> 02:23:52,590
Brother!
- Hey

1938
02:23:55,300 --> 02:23:57,170
Come on, show the girl's photo

1939
02:23:58,000 --> 02:23:59,380
He says he would hand over Riya

1940
02:24:01,170 --> 02:24:02,920
He's saying to show if you have any photo

1941
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,960
Hey, get her

1942
02:24:55,960 --> 02:24:58,000
Hey, take her and leave from here.

1943
02:24:58,670 --> 02:25:00,800
I'll forget thinking it's a loss of 50 Lakhs

1944
02:25:02,800 --> 02:25:04,170
How can you leave him simply?

1945
02:25:04,380 --> 02:25:07,130
If he has police with him
then the plan will get spoiled

1946
02:25:07,420 --> 02:25:08,170
Leave it.

1947
02:25:08,460 --> 02:25:10,550
Not just my girl...

1948
02:25:11,170 --> 02:25:16,500
When they are brought up like a moon making
them walk on palms as her feet would hurt,

1949
02:25:17,840 --> 02:25:20,960
do you sell them like
some material in the shop?

1950
02:25:24,170 --> 02:25:31,210
Every girl here will have a mother,
father, sister and a brother like me

1951
02:25:34,630 --> 02:25:40,000
I need every girl you
have along with your lives

1952
02:25:45,340 --> 02:25:48,050
Subbu... Let's go from here

1953
02:25:49,590 --> 02:25:50,250
Hold her that side

1954
02:25:53,050 --> 02:26:01,840
Every guy thinking to do business with the
modesty of girls should remember your dead bodies

1955
02:26:02,130 --> 02:26:03,880
Hey, what is he saying?

1956
02:26:06,050 --> 02:26:07,880
Basically he is saying
you are all screwed up

1957
02:26:09,590 --> 02:26:10,210
Неужели?"

1958
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:19,960
Hey, do you know who am I? Ok, I'll say

1959
02:26:20,670 --> 02:26:22,930
I've killed more than 30 people till date

1960
02:26:23,920 --> 02:26:28,070
And exported more than 300
girls out of the country

1961
02:26:29,300 --> 02:26:30,880
And you idiot wish to mess with me?

1962
02:26:32,210 --> 02:26:33,750
Hey, where did you come from rascal?

1963
02:26:34,420 --> 02:26:37,130
And what will you do to me?

1964
02:26:39,710 --> 02:26:41,920
He is asking where are you
from and what can you do?

1965
02:26:44,090 --> 02:26:46,750
Chittoor district, Akkurthi village,

1966
02:26:47,090 --> 02:26:52,250
We are soft as Lord Venkateswara is
on the hill but if you mess with us...

1967
02:27:40,880 --> 02:27:44,340
Subbu...Take Riya and wait in the boat,
I will just be back

1968
02:27:44,420 --> 02:27:45,340
Ok Careful

1969
02:27:50,170 --> 02:27:51,380
Hey..Stop.

1970
02:28:09,630 --> 02:28:10,920
Kill him, go

1971
02:29:37,920 --> 02:29:39,750
You know the value of this?

1972
02:29:41,130 --> 02:29:43,000
800 Bucks

1973
02:29:44,250 --> 02:29:46,500
I kept as a remembrance of my girl

1974
02:29:47,960 --> 02:29:48,800
How much does this stick cost?

1975
02:29:50,130 --> 02:29:51,550
How can I give it to you?

1976
02:30:19,420 --> 02:30:21,000
Krishna weds Riya

1977
02:30:22,210 --> 02:30:24,630
What dude, how is the board?
- Great bro

1978
02:30:25,050 --> 02:30:27,960
Bro, please teach me to write
letters like this Ok, come

1979
02:30:28,090 --> 02:30:31,590
I'll test how much English do you know.
Tell the spelling of Collector?

1980
02:30:32,170 --> 02:30:34,130
Keletor..

1981
02:30:34,550 --> 02:30:36,840
Correct dude, you are my assistant
- Thanks bro

1982
02:30:36,880 --> 02:30:37,920
Say the spelling of Doctor

1983
02:30:37,960 --> 02:30:39,670
Do...
- Not Do dude

1984
02:30:40,550 --> 02:30:42,300
What Police man, you are so happy?

1985
02:30:42,500 --> 02:30:44,420
By mistake did you win a
crore in lottery or what?

1986
02:30:44,710 --> 02:30:50,710
Not getting a crore but am happy as
the thousands in my account are safe

1987
02:30:50,750 --> 02:30:51,380
How is that?

1988
02:30:52,300 --> 02:30:54,250
It seems signals will not
come in your village right?

1989
02:30:54,460 --> 02:30:56,770
If my wife has shop for anything,
I have to tell her the OTP.

1990
02:30:57,290 --> 02:30:58,760
If I don't give the OTP,
my wife cannot shop

1991
02:30:59,170 --> 02:31:00,840
I am very happy, go

1992
02:31:01,170 --> 02:31:04,960
No idea what is his OTP nuisance
- Have you made all food arrangements well?

1993
02:31:05,090 --> 02:31:06,630
Hey dark rascal, bring it here

1994
02:31:07,460 --> 02:31:09,000
Give cool drink to Savitri aunt
- Take it aunty

1995
02:31:09,420 --> 02:31:13,550
Why do I need all these dear? All big
people have come, go and give them. Go

1996
02:31:13,630 --> 02:31:18,960
Look, if your son wasn't there lives
of many hundreds of girls would've been ruined

1997
02:31:19,250 --> 02:31:21,090
Who else is bigger than you here?

1998
02:31:21,250 --> 02:31:22,550
Take it madam
- Take it aunty

1999
02:31:22,590 --> 02:31:23,250
Take it...

2000
02:31:23,500 --> 02:31:24,920
Go and give it to the others,
- Go

2001
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:27,460
Wow, it is not an ordinary
matter that even he is changed

2002
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:32,670
Congrats Krishna!
What? Did you recognize us?

2003
02:31:32,960 --> 02:31:35,670
How can I forget you?
You are call girls right?

2004
02:31:37,340 --> 02:31:39,000
Not call girls but call center

2005
02:31:39,170 --> 02:31:41,670
I too am saying the same right?
Go and have food

2006
02:31:41,710 --> 02:31:43,630
Ok, see you
- Thank you

2007
02:31:46,960 --> 02:31:49,340
Name of this flower is...
Liliaceae helianthus

2008
02:31:50,670 --> 02:31:53,130
I mugged up a few science names for you

2009
02:31:55,300 --> 02:31:56,460
How sweet

2010
02:31:57,960 --> 02:32:01,090
Ok, where is Arjun?

2011
02:32:15,130 --> 02:32:16,800
Hey Krishna, there

2012
02:32:25,500 --> 02:32:27,340
All set.... Wow suite

2013
02:32:28,420 --> 02:32:29,340
Even Subbalakshmi has come

2014
02:32:29,550 --> 02:32:30,170
Hi. Hi.

2015
02:32:30,500 --> 02:32:30,920
Here.

2016
02:32:33,050 --> 02:32:33,750
[All muttering]

2017
02:32:34,420 --> 02:32:37,250
You too are coming to Europe with us,
flight tickets

2018
02:32:38,550 --> 02:32:39,840
What's there in Europe for us

2019
02:32:40,880 --> 02:32:42,840
Because we both are going to
work together from now

2020
02:32:43,300 --> 02:32:46,710
25% each to us from the money
we get for every program.

2021
02:32:47,130 --> 02:32:50,170
Rest 50% is for the NGO

2022
02:32:50,550 --> 02:32:55,630
"You are a King with a
heart as the huge sky"

2023
02:32:57,250 --> 02:32:58,840
"You are the man with cool
sight as the moonlight"

2024
02:32:58,920 --> 02:33:00,170
Can you listen to any song?

2025
02:33:00,380 --> 02:33:03,590
"You are the man with cool
sight as the moonlight"

2026
02:33:04,380 --> 02:33:05,710
No

2027
02:33:07,670 --> 02:33:12,840
That means, for the first time
only I alone am listening to a song

2028
02:33:13,500 --> 02:33:15,420
What shall I do if you both work together?

2029
02:33:18,250 --> 02:33:19,670
Who will teach music to Aunty..

2030
02:33:19,710 --> 02:33:23,380
Music to aunty? No!
