1
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,166
'Soul is eternal.'

2
00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:15,833
'It never takes birth.
It never dies.'

3
00:00:16,457 --> 00:00:19,707
'The way every person's
death is certain..'

4
00:00:20,082 --> 00:00:24,000
'Similarly we believe that if your
desires remain unfulfilled..

5
00:00:24,082 --> 00:00:27,582
..then you take a rebirth.'

6
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:32,000
'But its very rare
that you remember..

7
00:00:32,082 --> 00:00:36,582
..the events of your
previous birth.'

8
00:00:38,082 --> 00:00:41,000
'This story is about
such a young man..

9
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:43,500
..who remembered his
previous birth.'

10
00:00:44,832 --> 00:00:47,750
'And this is Prasad Production's
unique film.'

11
00:01:07,775 --> 00:01:10,800
'In this film Sunil Dutt..

12
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:18,076
..Nutan, Jamuna and..'

13
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,449
Silence! Silence! Silence!

14
00:03:37,597 --> 00:03:41,850
Along with being happy, I
am proud to say that..

15
00:03:41,949 --> 00:03:44,506
..these two brilliant students
of our college..

16
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:49,424
..Gopinath and Radha,
succeeded not just..

17
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,550
..in the college exams but
also in the test of life.

18
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,580
They got married in this
college in front of us.

19
00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:04,734
That's even better news.

20
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:10,320
Both my students, whom
I have known closely..

21
00:04:10,669 --> 00:04:13,358
..through out their lives,
their love is a saga of..

22
00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:16,401
..true love which has been..

23
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,920
..existing for ages and it will
remain for ages to come.

24
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,742
The way they were successful
in their college lives..

25
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,524
..they should be successful
in their marriage life too..

26
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,639
..from where life actually begins..

27
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,704
..this is my blessing to them.

28
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,500
Radha and Gopinath!
- Hail to them!

29
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,358
Already you are sweating. What
will you do in the future?

30
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,000
Come on! We had a hearty feast!

31
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:11,949
Now push the car!

32
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:12,949
C'mon brothers! Push!

33
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:11,232
"We both have been singing this
song of love since ages."

34
00:06:11,315 --> 00:06:15,690
"We will sing it forever."

35
00:06:15,774 --> 00:06:27,065
"We both have been life partners
in many lifetimes."

36
00:06:27,149 --> 00:06:31,690
"We will remain forever."

37
00:06:31,774 --> 00:06:42,983
"We both have been singing this
song of love since ages."

38
00:06:43,065 --> 00:06:47,482
"We will sing it forever."

39
00:06:47,565 --> 00:06:49,065
"We both.."

40
00:07:16,524 --> 00:07:25,149
"Whenever clouds gathered
in the monsoon."

41
00:07:25,483 --> 00:07:28,675
"You got scared of the lightening."

42
00:07:28,966 --> 00:07:32,500
"Then what happened? Tell me."

43
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,879
"The rainfall might stop."

44
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:41,515
"The rainfall might stop."

45
00:07:55,478 --> 00:07:59,894
"The world couldn't
break this bond."

46
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,199
"We met breaking every barrier."

47
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:12,799
"We met in every lifetime."

48
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:21,685
"God said ask for the whole world."

49
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:25,699
"But I said, I don't
want the world."

50
00:08:25,899 --> 00:08:30,310
"I just want my beloved's love."

51
00:08:35,394 --> 00:08:46,144
"We both have been singing this
song of love since ages."

52
00:08:46,227 --> 00:08:50,394
"We will sing it forever."

53
00:08:58,769 --> 00:09:00,186
Driver! Stop the boat!

54
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:02,727
Why don't you stop it?
I said stop the boat!

55
00:09:02,811 --> 00:09:04,103
What happened, Gopi?
What's the matter?

56
00:09:04,186 --> 00:09:05,394
Driver! Stop the boat!

57
00:09:05,477 --> 00:09:07,099
There is a whirlpool ahead!
We all will drown!

58
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:08,649
Whirlpool! Drown!

59
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:11,899
Sir, which era are
you talking about?

60
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,982
Now everything has changed.

61
00:09:14,607 --> 00:09:16,482
A dam has been built on the river.

62
00:09:17,482 --> 00:09:19,565
Now instead of a boat,
we use motor boat.

63
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:21,566
Now there is no fear of drowning.

64
00:09:21,857 --> 00:09:23,482
You are worrying unnecessarily.

65
00:09:23,566 --> 00:09:25,691
Don't argue! Do as I say!

66
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:27,732
Darling, please. What is all this?

67
00:09:28,524 --> 00:09:31,941
Radha! Radha! Radha!

68
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,500
He wants to drown us!
He wants to kill us!

69
00:09:36,582 --> 00:09:38,399
Radha! Tell him to stop the boat!

70
00:09:38,917 --> 00:09:40,530
All right, darling! All right!

71
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,125
Driver! Stop the boat!

72
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:45,125
As you wish!

73
00:10:09,832 --> 00:10:10,916
Gopi!

74
00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:20,317
Gopi! What happened to you suddenly?

75
00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:25,232
What are you looking at?
What are you thinking?

76
00:10:25,732 --> 00:10:26,816
Tell me!

77
00:10:27,149 --> 00:10:28,732
Radha! Radha!

78
00:10:29,607 --> 00:10:32,857
Somewhere here must be
the landlord's mansion.

79
00:10:33,982 --> 00:10:39,399
And.. and.. and in this
mansion..

80
00:10:39,482 --> 00:10:42,732
Madam! Yes!

81
00:10:43,692 --> 00:10:46,149
Yes! Madam!

82
00:10:46,942 --> 00:10:48,442
Madam!

83
00:10:48,524 --> 00:10:50,442
Madam! Madam!

84
00:11:13,149 --> 00:11:14,232
Madam!

85
00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:19,107
Madam! Madam!

86
00:11:20,942 --> 00:11:24,024
You are searching for humans
in the ruins of ghosts.

87
00:11:24,924 --> 00:11:26,216
Who are you, sir?

88
00:11:26,758 --> 00:11:29,508
Baba, I am Gopi! Gopi!

89
00:11:29,883 --> 00:11:30,966
Gopi.. who?

90
00:11:31,049 --> 00:11:32,841
That same Gopi, the boatman.

91
00:11:32,924 --> 00:11:35,382
He used to take madam across
the river everyday.

92
00:11:35,392 --> 00:11:36,475
I am that Gopi!

93
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:40,933
Why are you laughing, Baba?

94
00:11:41,017 --> 00:11:43,975
If you joke then won't I laugh?

95
00:11:44,057 --> 00:11:46,225
I am not joking. I am telling
the truth. I swear.

96
00:11:46,307 --> 00:11:47,850
What truth are you saying?

97
00:11:47,932 --> 00:11:51,725
You fool an old man, sir.
Is this good?

98
00:11:51,807 --> 00:11:59,141
Gopi, the boatman, died before
you were born. Do you know?

99
00:12:00,225 --> 00:12:04,307
I know. I know everything.
I know everything.

100
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:06,475
I am Gopi, the boatman.

101
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:09,975
Whatever happened, it's not
somebody else's experience.

102
00:12:10,142 --> 00:12:11,933
I have experienced it, Baba.
First tell me where is madam?

103
00:12:12,017 --> 00:12:14,767
Gopi! What is all this?
What has happened to you?

104
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,392
Baba! Tell me! Where is madam?

105
00:12:16,975 --> 00:12:18,057
Madam? Who?

106
00:12:20,057 --> 00:12:21,850
Landlord's daughter?

107
00:12:21,932 --> 00:12:23,225
Yes! That madam!

108
00:12:23,307 --> 00:12:29,350
Is she still alive? She
drowned in river Ganga!

109
00:12:31,267 --> 00:12:36,975
Yes. Right. She drowned
in river Ganga!

110
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:40,057
And.. and..

111
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:48,225
And yes!

112
00:12:49,225 --> 00:12:55,432
Baba, what about that girl?
She was a shepherd.

113
00:12:56,225 --> 00:12:57,850
And she used to roam in
the entire village.

114
00:12:59,932 --> 00:13:02,850
Do you mean Gauri?

115
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,432
Gauri? Yes! Gauri! What about her?

116
00:13:08,517 --> 00:13:11,642
That poor girl is still alive, sir.

117
00:13:12,017 --> 00:13:13,600
What did you say? She is alive!

118
00:13:13,682 --> 00:13:15,725
Gauri is alive? Where
is she? How is she?

119
00:13:15,807 --> 00:13:19,141
What alive? She is as
good as dead, sir.

120
00:13:20,307 --> 00:13:22,975
Time has not been kind to her.

121
00:13:24,267 --> 00:13:28,225
What she did to save
Radha and Gopi..

122
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:31,725
..no other woman in the world
must have done that.

123
00:13:32,057 --> 00:13:33,307
What did she do, Baba?

124
00:13:34,975 --> 00:13:37,517
Ask what she didn't do.

125
00:13:39,267 --> 00:13:44,216
A woman's honour which
is priceless for her..

126
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,057
..she sacrificed that too.

127
00:13:47,142 --> 00:13:48,225
Because Rajendra had asked that..

128
00:13:48,307 --> 00:13:53,141
..in return for Gopi
and Radha's lives.

129
00:13:54,642 --> 00:14:00,800
But sir, she was cheated.
Very badly.

130
00:14:01,932 --> 00:14:03,682
Gopi and Radha died.

131
00:14:04,892 --> 00:14:09,975
Rajendra too deceived her
and went to the city.

132
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:15,892
Sir, do you know what Gauri got
in return for this sacrifice?

133
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,142
Every village banished her.

134
00:14:21,975 --> 00:14:25,225
Everybody abused her.

135
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:30,307
Still I don't know why and for
what she is still alive.

136
00:14:31,225 --> 00:14:32,892
I don't know hoping for what.

137
00:14:33,932 --> 00:14:36,391
God knows whom she is waiting for.

138
00:14:36,892 --> 00:14:39,142
But Baba, where is Gauri now?

139
00:14:39,557 --> 00:14:46,200
There. Near the river banks.
Near Radha and Gopi's tomb.

140
00:14:48,682 --> 00:14:50,932
Gauri!

141
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,933
Gopi! Gopi!

142
00:14:57,225 --> 00:15:05,475
I always said.. that I
will die in your arms.

143
00:15:08,725 --> 00:15:12,767
I am still alive in this hope.

144
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:21,074
Death always calls to me.

145
00:15:21,634 --> 00:15:30,504
But my hope says.. Gauri,
wait for a while.

146
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:40,975
How long will I hover
between life and death?

147
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:48,474
I am going.. defeated.. tired.

148
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:54,599
With the unfulfilled wish
to die in your arms.

149
00:15:55,057 --> 00:16:01,475
I am going forever. I am going.

150
00:16:03,225 --> 00:16:09,391
Now you won't come, Gopi.
Now you won't come.

151
00:16:09,475 --> 00:16:10,725
Gauri! Gauri!

152
00:16:11,475 --> 00:16:14,141
I have come, Gauri!
I have come! Look!

153
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,307
Your Gopi has come!

154
00:16:16,975 --> 00:16:21,350
Gauri! You didn't lose.
You have won.

155
00:16:22,807 --> 00:16:27,350
Look, Gauri! You are
in your Gopi's arms!

156
00:16:32,307 --> 00:16:38,057
Yes, Gauri! I am Gopi! I am Gopi!

157
00:16:39,057 --> 00:16:41,015
Yes, Gauri! Yes!

158
00:16:43,225 --> 00:16:44,307
Gauri!

159
00:16:45,432 --> 00:16:48,432
Gauri! Gauri! Gauri!

160
00:16:48,515 --> 00:16:52,724
Gopi! Gopi! Gopi, what's
going on? Tell me!

161
00:16:53,057 --> 00:16:54,807
Tell me! Otherwise I will die!

162
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,765
What is all this?
Who is Gauri, Gopi?

163
00:16:59,765 --> 00:17:02,974
Radha, you don't know Gauri!

164
00:17:04,307 --> 00:17:09,891
She is the same Gauri..
who always used to smile.

165
00:17:11,641 --> 00:17:15,391
Like a free doe she would wander
in the entire village.

166
00:17:17,807 --> 00:17:19,307
She was like waterfall.

167
00:17:21,057 --> 00:17:23,974
Capricious and mischievous
like an innocent child.

168
00:17:27,516 --> 00:17:30,391
Radha, she is that Gauri!

169
00:18:09,465 --> 00:18:13,674
"Beloved, you don't know."

170
00:18:14,174 --> 00:18:18,174
"Beloved, you don't know."

171
00:18:18,715 --> 00:18:26,465
"Beloved, because of you in my own
city, I have become a stranger."

172
00:18:26,965 --> 00:18:30,632
"I have become a stranger."

173
00:18:31,633 --> 00:18:35,508
"Beloved, you don't know."

174
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:42,257
"Beloved, because of you in my own
city, I have become a stranger."

175
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,329
"Stranger."

176
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:46,540
"I have become a stranger."

177
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:25,441
"I don't know which is my courtyard
and which is my roof."

178
00:19:25,775 --> 00:19:33,566
"I don't know which is my courtyard
and which is my roof."

179
00:19:34,107 --> 00:19:41,482
"I wander on the streets
of my own village."

180
00:19:41,775 --> 00:19:46,358
"Leave me home."

181
00:19:48,357 --> 00:19:52,450
"Leave me home."

182
00:19:52,607 --> 00:19:55,691
"I have become a stranger."

183
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,750
"Stranger."

184
00:19:56,849 --> 00:20:00,182
"I have become a stranger."

185
00:20:01,307 --> 00:20:05,099
"Beloved, you don't know."

186
00:20:05,266 --> 00:20:12,432
"Beloved, because of you in my own
city, I have become a stranger."

187
00:20:12,974 --> 00:20:16,515
"I have become a stranger."

188
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:48,149
"This world seems like a dream..

189
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:52,575
..solace, slumber, love and youth."

190
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:56,116
"This world seems like a dream..

191
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,616
..solace, slumber, love and youth."

192
00:21:01,034 --> 00:21:03,117
"I have nothing left."

193
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,034
"When I have given my life to you."

194
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:13,325
"I miss my kin."

195
00:21:15,284 --> 00:21:18,950
"I miss my kin."

196
00:21:19,034 --> 00:21:22,117
"I have become a stranger."

197
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,325
"Stranger."

198
00:21:23,409 --> 00:21:26,450
"I have become a stranger."

199
00:21:27,784 --> 00:21:31,409
"Beloved, you don't know."

200
00:21:31,784 --> 00:21:38,867
"Beloved, because of you in my own
city, I have become a stranger."

201
00:21:39,325 --> 00:21:42,659
"I have become a stranger."

202
00:21:56,842 --> 00:21:59,800
I see! So you people have
already entered the boat!

203
00:22:00,424 --> 00:22:02,700
I know! This is Gauri's mischief!

204
00:22:02,849 --> 00:22:05,699
Come on! Get out!

205
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:07,567
Get out! Come on!

206
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,025
Are you hurt?

207
00:22:17,025 --> 00:22:19,650
It was not a stone. It was a flower.

208
00:22:19,733 --> 00:22:21,144
Come on! Naughty girl!

209
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,450
Enough! I hit you once!
And you hit me once!

210
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:25,399
It settles the score!

211
00:22:25,509 --> 00:22:26,717
Now take me across the river!

212
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:31,134
Hey! This boat is for madam!
Not for goats!

213
00:22:31,259 --> 00:22:34,134
I see! So are they less than madam?

214
00:22:34,842 --> 00:22:37,800
Gauri! You compare madam with goats!

215
00:22:38,134 --> 00:22:40,549
No, no! I am not mad!

216
00:22:40,634 --> 00:22:42,467
That I will compare them with madam!

217
00:22:42,842 --> 00:22:45,217
These poor goats give sweet milk.

218
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:47,466
What does madam give? Nothing!

219
00:22:47,549 --> 00:22:49,884
Gauri! Beware if you
spoke ill of madam!

220
00:22:49,967 --> 00:22:52,217
I will thrash you black and blue!

221
00:22:52,509 --> 00:22:53,967
I won't spare you!

222
00:22:55,134 --> 00:22:57,049
Will you say this about madam?
- Yes!

223
00:22:57,134 --> 00:22:58,217
You will say it!
- Yes!

224
00:22:58,299 --> 00:23:00,216
Then I will beat you!
- Leave me!

225
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:02,134
Will you say this about madam?
- Yes!

226
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,900
I will beat you! I will beat you!
- I will say it! I will say it!

227
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:06,050
Madam has come!

228
00:23:08,842 --> 00:23:09,925
Give me, madam!

229
00:23:10,009 --> 00:23:11,884
Gopi, why are you fighting with her?

230
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:15,058
Madam, look. This girl is always..

231
00:23:15,142 --> 00:23:17,200
What will you show? I will show you!

232
00:23:17,683 --> 00:23:20,349
Madam! You came late!

233
00:23:20,433 --> 00:23:23,200
I told him till then take
my goats across the river!

234
00:23:23,324 --> 00:23:24,574
He refused!

235
00:23:24,949 --> 00:23:27,240
So I hit him.

236
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:31,069
And he thrashed me badly
here and there!

237
00:23:31,574 --> 00:23:32,070
Here and there!
- Gauri!

238
00:23:32,554 --> 00:23:36,100
Here and there!
- Saw that!

239
00:23:36,354 --> 00:23:37,799
You both quarrelled because of me.

240
00:23:38,295 --> 00:23:40,461
Come on. Now I have come.

241
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,284
Madam!

242
00:23:56,116 --> 00:23:57,700
You never forget this, Gopi.

243
00:23:57,784 --> 00:23:58,950
How can he forget it?

244
00:23:59,034 --> 00:24:00,367
The first thing he does when
he wakes up in the morning..

245
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:02,200
..is to hide the flower.

246
00:24:02,284 --> 00:24:05,200
I am bound to hide it. Won't
this fool steal it?

247
00:24:05,491 --> 00:24:06,991
You call me a fool!

248
00:24:07,616 --> 00:24:08,700
Get lost!

249
00:24:08,784 --> 00:24:10,617
Why do you both always quarrel?

250
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,200
What to do, madam? She
is an illiterate!

251
00:24:13,366 --> 00:24:15,200
What did you say? An illiterate!

252
00:24:15,284 --> 00:24:18,367
I am illiterate? So
are you a learned man?

253
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,534
If I am not then I will become one.

254
00:24:20,616 --> 00:24:23,200
Do you know? Everyday madam
teaches me English.

255
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,116
So madam, teach me today's lesson.

256
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,409
Make your kin keep quiet!

257
00:24:29,784 --> 00:24:33,034
What do you mean! They are my goat!

258
00:24:33,116 --> 00:24:34,866
Goat!
- Yes!

259
00:24:35,116 --> 00:24:37,408
Madam, she always teases me.

260
00:24:37,491 --> 00:24:39,741
Today I too will tease her.
But in English.

261
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,825
Madam! O God!

262
00:24:48,075 --> 00:24:49,366
Madam, tell me..

263
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,284
Get lost!

264
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:56,909
Madam, what do you call
a fool in English?

265
00:24:57,741 --> 00:24:58,825
Why?

266
00:24:59,366 --> 00:25:02,116
I want to call her a fool.

267
00:25:03,491 --> 00:25:06,099
Okay. Say this.. do you remember..

268
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,450
..how do you say this
girl in English?

269
00:25:11,304 --> 00:25:15,798
This.. this..
- Girl.

270
00:25:16,135 --> 00:25:17,219
Girl.
- Yes.

271
00:25:17,303 --> 00:25:18,386
This girl.
- Okay.

272
00:25:18,469 --> 00:25:20,385
Is very good.

273
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:26,469
Is.. very..
- Good.

274
00:25:26,553 --> 00:25:27,636
Good.
- Yes.

275
00:25:27,969 --> 00:25:35,053
This girl is.. very.. good.
- Good.

276
00:25:35,303 --> 00:25:38,136
This girl is very good!
- Right!

277
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:46,594
This! This girl is.. very good!

278
00:25:47,385 --> 00:25:50,302
This girl is very good! Very good!

279
00:25:51,394 --> 00:25:53,099
As if I don't know English!

280
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,533
I too can say this girl
is good, good, sugarcane!

281
00:25:57,407 --> 00:25:58,490
Sugarcane!

282
00:25:59,674 --> 00:26:00,758
Is this English?

283
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,840
Fine! Wait! I will just
tell you! Tell me, madam!

284
00:26:03,924 --> 00:26:05,215
What did he say?

285
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:08,299
What will madam tell you?
I will tell you. - Tell me.

286
00:26:09,395 --> 00:26:13,145
This girl.. meaning this girl..

287
00:26:13,729 --> 00:26:16,979
Is good means is a fool.

288
00:26:18,479 --> 00:26:21,229
Is very good. Meaning a big fool.

289
00:26:21,311 --> 00:26:23,395
Is very good. Meaning a big fool.

290
00:26:23,895 --> 00:26:26,811
Tell me, madam, is he
speaking the truth?

291
00:26:26,895 --> 00:26:28,229
Is this what you told him?

292
00:26:28,729 --> 00:26:30,979
Very good means very nice.

293
00:26:33,915 --> 00:26:35,415
Did you hear that?
Did you hear that?

294
00:26:35,707 --> 00:26:37,874
Not a fool. I am a good girl.

295
00:26:37,957 --> 00:26:41,660
Good! Good! I am a very nice girl!
I am a very nice girl!

296
00:26:42,257 --> 00:26:44,095
Madam, is this what it means?

297
00:26:45,016 --> 00:26:48,849
Yes, Gopi. Gauri is a nice girl,
isn't she? That's why.

298
00:26:49,348 --> 00:26:50,932
This girl is very good.

299
00:26:54,266 --> 00:26:55,932
Madam is so nice!

300
00:26:57,766 --> 00:26:59,474
You lost! You lost!
- You lost!

301
00:26:59,557 --> 00:27:02,266
Get lost! Don't talk to me!
I won't talk to you!

302
00:27:02,473 --> 00:27:03,848
You get lost!
- Get lost!

303
00:27:17,348 --> 00:27:20,599
O my God! It's so bad!
- Now what happened?

304
00:27:20,729 --> 00:27:23,895
Radha has still not returned
from college. She is so late.

305
00:27:23,979 --> 00:27:28,062
You take 3 hours to bring a
glass of water from the kitchen.

306
00:27:28,686 --> 00:27:31,936
She has to come so far from
the city, crossing the river.

307
00:27:32,229 --> 00:27:34,854
Try to understand that.
- Yes. I understand everything.

308
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,379
If I won't understand
then everybody..

309
00:27:36,461 --> 00:27:38,128
..will say that I am a step-mother.

310
00:27:38,211 --> 00:27:39,796
She has become Kaikai
(wicked woman) in her house.

311
00:27:41,836 --> 00:27:42,921
Why are you laughing?

312
00:27:43,753 --> 00:27:45,045
You have given a nice example.

313
00:27:45,503 --> 00:27:47,711
The person who has called
Kaikai a step-mother..

314
00:27:48,102 --> 00:27:49,200
..must have been a poet.

315
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,608
Yes. The entire village
is reciting poetry.

316
00:27:51,692 --> 00:27:53,317
You too recite some poem.

317
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,817
Madam, what to cook for dinner?

318
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,650
Let Radha come. She will tell you.

319
00:27:58,732 --> 00:28:02,442
Why? If Radha doesn't tell him
then won't he cook dinner?

320
00:28:02,817 --> 00:28:05,232
When she goes to
her in-law's place..

321
00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:07,150
..then will we all have to fast?

322
00:28:07,317 --> 00:28:10,692
Look! I have said this not
once but countless times!

323
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,400
My daughter won't go to
her in-law's place!

324
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:16,025
Her groom will have to stay here.

325
00:28:16,775 --> 00:28:18,400
She will always be near me.

326
00:28:20,025 --> 00:28:22,317
Father!
- Dear, you have come.

327
00:28:22,942 --> 00:28:24,025
You returned so late.

328
00:28:24,107 --> 00:28:25,966
Yes, father. Today we had Practicals
(part of study) in college.

329
00:28:26,017 --> 00:28:27,025
That's why I got late.

330
00:28:27,107 --> 00:28:31,649
First tell the cook. Then father
and daughter can sit and talk.

331
00:28:31,732 --> 00:28:33,524
Yes, dear. Tell the cook
what you want to eat.

332
00:28:33,607 --> 00:28:35,567
Cook whatever mother likes.

333
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:38,600
At least somebody likes my likes.

334
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,180
Madam's favourite dish.

335
00:28:40,262 --> 00:28:43,387
Then it will be millet bread,
eggplant and garlic chutney.

336
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:44,555
Get lost!

337
00:29:18,349 --> 00:29:20,599
Hey! Come on! Carry my luggage!

338
00:29:22,849 --> 00:29:24,682
Why are you chewing the sugarcane?
Can't you hear?

339
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:25,850
Carry my luggage!

340
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:31,067
Hey! Are you deaf?

341
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:38,452
Whom you are addressing as hey?

342
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:42,341
Not to you. I am calling him.
-  He is not your servant.

343
00:29:42,424 --> 00:29:46,384
No, he is a Prince.
- You are so arrogant.

344
00:29:46,467 --> 00:29:50,925
Don't you know who I am?
-  I know! A prince!

345
00:29:51,009 --> 00:29:53,134
You brute! Idiot! Fool! Shut up!

346
00:29:53,424 --> 00:29:56,924
Look, Gopi! This mister
is abusing me in English!

347
00:29:59,142 --> 00:30:01,282
Sir, I am observing
since a long time.

348
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:03,183
You are showing off your English!

349
00:30:04,099 --> 00:30:05,881
What do you think? I
don't know English!

350
00:30:05,951 --> 00:30:07,061
You are a fool!
- Yes!

351
00:30:07,571 --> 00:30:08,507
A battered boot!

352
00:30:08,821 --> 00:30:10,461
If we both abused you in English..

353
00:30:10,587 --> 00:30:12,672
..then you will get
tired answering us!

354
00:30:12,755 --> 00:30:13,838
Got it?

355
00:30:14,005 --> 00:30:15,300
Shut up, idiot!
- What did you say?

356
00:30:15,349 --> 00:30:16,782
Just a minute!
- Again!

357
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:17,449
Hang on!

358
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:23,533
Sir! Leave them! You
come in my boat.

359
00:30:23,616 --> 00:30:24,700
Where is your luggage?

360
00:30:24,782 --> 00:30:26,907
In the horse carriage. Quickly
bring it. - Okay. Hold this.

361
00:30:44,325 --> 00:30:48,658
Hey, sir is new here. Take
him across carefully.

362
00:30:48,741 --> 00:30:51,366
Don't drown him in the
current. Got it?

363
00:30:51,866 --> 00:30:55,825
Hey, girl! Keep your bad prophecy
with you! Got it?

364
00:30:59,097 --> 00:31:01,014
Come on, Gopi! Let's teach
him a lesson. Come on!

365
00:31:01,432 --> 00:31:02,515
Okay!

366
00:31:13,265 --> 00:31:14,932
Gopi!
- Yes!

367
00:31:15,682 --> 00:31:20,000
Isn't this the same boat in which
an entire family had drowned?

368
00:31:21,231 --> 00:31:24,022
That is nothing, Gauri. Do you know?

369
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:27,940
On the last moonless night how many
people drowned in this boat?

370
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,523
O my God!

371
00:31:30,099 --> 00:31:31,224
And that poor old lady.

372
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:35,473
Her young son drowned in such a way..

373
00:31:35,849 --> 00:31:37,740
..that we didn't even
find his clothes.

374
00:31:37,767 --> 00:31:39,557
O God!

375
00:31:41,057 --> 00:31:44,019
What a co-incidence!

376
00:31:44,224 --> 00:31:46,349
On every moonless day Jaggu's boat..

377
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:47,990
..gives a sacrifice to river Ganga.

378
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:49,600
Yes, Gauri. You are right.

379
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:53,975
Yes! Today too is moonless day!

380
00:31:55,642 --> 00:31:58,225
Poor sir will lose his life.

381
00:31:58,724 --> 00:32:01,557
Sir, do you know swimming?

382
00:32:01,642 --> 00:32:02,807
No! No!

383
00:32:02,999 --> 00:32:05,079
O my God! I don't know to swim.

384
00:32:05,125 --> 00:32:05,779
Now what will happen?

385
00:32:06,099 --> 00:32:10,799
Sir, don't listen to them. For
you I will lay down my life!

386
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:13,932
If you laid down your life then
my life won't be saved.

387
00:32:17,017 --> 00:32:21,392
Sir! Sir! Look at the world
to your heart's content!

388
00:32:21,474 --> 00:32:25,699
And remember mother Ganga!
She will drown you!

389
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:26,899
O my God!

390
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,099
Now you won't have to
drink the holy water.

391
00:32:29,299 --> 00:32:31,700
Because you will drown in Ganga.

392
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,991
Look, Gauri. Let me warn you.
- We are leaving.

393
00:32:34,075 --> 00:32:35,325
Let's go, Gopi!
- Come on! Come on!

394
00:32:35,407 --> 00:32:36,657
Sir, you don't worry.

395
00:32:39,741 --> 00:32:41,532
Saw that, sir. We have reached.

396
00:32:41,616 --> 00:32:43,241
Anything happened to you?
- No.

397
00:32:43,616 --> 00:32:47,032
They were just scaring you.
- But who is that girl?

398
00:32:47,491 --> 00:32:53,116
That girl! She is an orphan! She
just roams in the village!

399
00:32:53,116 --> 00:32:55,359
And that guy is her?
- Nobody.

400
00:32:55,801 --> 00:32:59,301
That guy too is an orphan!
He is not that girl's kin.

401
00:32:59,593 --> 00:33:01,593
No matter what. The girl is a bomb.

402
00:33:02,051 --> 00:33:06,301
Bomb! Sir, you have good eyesight.

403
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:08,842
Wow! You recognised her.

404
00:33:09,176 --> 00:33:12,134
But does that man
relishes her youth?

405
00:33:13,009 --> 00:33:15,801
What will he relish?
He is not capable!

406
00:33:15,884 --> 00:33:20,301
You need a capable man for her.

407
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:22,426
What? I don't understand.

408
00:33:22,509 --> 00:33:27,009
Sir, you are an educated man.
Try to understand.

409
00:33:27,093 --> 00:33:31,718
I understood! Here! Now I
too have become capable.

410
00:33:33,509 --> 00:33:36,134
Sir, now I will try my best.

411
00:33:39,701 --> 00:33:40,785
Greetings!

412
00:33:40,867 --> 00:33:43,034
Greetings! Rajendra,
when did you come?

413
00:33:43,117 --> 00:33:44,099
When did I come, brother-in-law?

414
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,825
I have just come.
But not completely.

415
00:33:46,907 --> 00:33:50,532
First remove your shoes.
- Remove my shoes? Why?

416
00:33:50,615 --> 00:33:52,282
Remove it! Whenever I come here..

417
00:33:52,365 --> 00:33:54,450
..you immediately remove your shoes.

418
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:56,907
But these are old ones,
brother-in-law.

419
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:58,490
What difference does it makes,
brother-in-law?

420
00:33:58,575 --> 00:33:59,658
Remove it!

421
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:05,200
That's it? So this was the matter.

422
00:34:05,657 --> 00:34:07,740
Brother-in-law, my intentions
had turned bad.

423
00:34:09,657 --> 00:34:11,532
Brother, when did you come?

424
00:34:12,032 --> 00:34:14,615
Why are you sitting
on the floor? Sit up.

425
00:34:14,949 --> 00:34:17,115
Brother-in-law was touching my feet.

426
00:34:18,407 --> 00:34:19,824
How are you?
- I am fine.

427
00:34:20,115 --> 00:34:21,282
How is brother-in-law?

428
00:34:21,615 --> 00:34:24,282
You can see. He looks fine.

429
00:34:24,532 --> 00:34:26,532
But worry is eating him from within.

430
00:34:26,615 --> 00:34:28,740
Sister, you don't worry.
Leave everything on me.

431
00:34:28,824 --> 00:34:30,949
I will handle all the business.

432
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:35,490
Brother-in-law, listen. If you
lose your leg, no problem.

433
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:36,824
You use my leg to walk.

434
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:40,282
If you become blind, no problem.
You see from my eyes.

435
00:34:40,365 --> 00:34:43,615
If your hands.. no, not hands.
You will need it.

436
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:45,365
You will have to sign the cheques.

437
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:48,432
Why? You do that too.

438
00:34:48,516 --> 00:34:49,766
Brother-in-law, you are joking.

439
00:34:49,849 --> 00:34:52,400
What to do, brother-in-law?
Our relationship is such.

440
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:53,349
That is fine!

441
00:34:53,465 --> 00:34:54,674
I have come here for the sake
of this relationship.

442
00:34:54,757 --> 00:34:56,507
Sister, you too think
of this relationship.

443
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:58,382
I am famished. Bring
something to eat.

444
00:34:58,465 --> 00:35:01,507
Why not? Come! Come!

445
00:35:03,925 --> 00:35:05,508
"Bad days are gone."

446
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:08,215
"Happy times are here."

447
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:12,175
"It has made my life bright."

448
00:35:12,257 --> 00:35:14,549
Rajjo! Rajjo!

449
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,008
"It has made my life bright."

450
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:20,715
"It has made my life bright."

451
00:35:22,125 --> 00:35:23,500
What have you done!

452
00:35:23,583 --> 00:35:25,791
Then what! Today you are so happy!

453
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:30,416
Not just today but I will
be happy everyday. Got it?

454
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:34,625
Now I am not just Jaggu,
I am mister Jaggu.

455
00:35:35,583 --> 00:35:38,208
See this! See this!
- 10 rupees!

456
00:35:40,208 --> 00:35:41,375
Listen!
- Yes!

457
00:35:41,458 --> 00:35:45,041
Did you steal it? Did
you rob somebody?

458
00:35:45,125 --> 00:35:47,833
What rubbish! After
all you are a woman!

459
00:35:47,916 --> 00:35:49,541
You always doubt me!

460
00:35:50,625 --> 00:35:56,041
I am a man. I go out
everyday. I work.

461
00:35:56,208 --> 00:35:58,208
That's how I make
both the ends meet.

462
00:35:58,375 --> 00:36:01,250
You don't get enough customers.

463
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:02,833
What will you earn?

464
00:36:04,583 --> 00:36:06,416
Rajjo! Rajjo!

465
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,583
Rajjo!

466
00:36:10,416 --> 00:36:13,541
Rajjo! Today you are
looking so pretty.

467
00:36:13,625 --> 00:36:16,708
Get lost! Say
what you want to say clearly.

468
00:36:18,583 --> 00:36:23,666
Rajjo! Rajjo! Tonight..
- What?

469
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:29,125
Tonight..
- Tell me.

470
00:36:29,541 --> 00:36:31,458
Tonight cook chicken.

471
00:36:32,666 --> 00:36:33,833
Cook chicken!

472
00:36:36,041 --> 00:36:38,875
Tonight..
- Tonight?

473
00:36:41,208 --> 00:36:44,125
Tonight..
- What? Tell me quickly!

474
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:45,583
What is tonight?

475
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:49,666
Tonight I feel like eating
wheat pancake and sweets.

476
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:52,958
Is that something to eat?
- Then what!

477
00:36:53,041 --> 00:36:54,208
There is a huge difference
between chicken..

478
00:36:54,291 --> 00:36:56,750
..and wheat pancake and sweets!
Today you will cook chicken!

479
00:36:56,833 --> 00:36:58,333
Today I will cook wheat
pancake and sweets!

480
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:00,416
Chicken!
- Wheat pancake and sweets!

481
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,958
Rajjo!
- Jaggu!

482
00:37:02,041 --> 00:37:03,708
Give me the money!
- No, I won't give it.

483
00:37:03,791 --> 00:37:05,250
Give me my money!
- No!

484
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:07,208
Give!
- No!

485
00:37:15,074 --> 00:37:17,429
Some of the King's lands were
sold over his bed by..

486
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,900
..the Dutch to the British.

487
00:37:18,949 --> 00:37:20,824
And he refused to requite it.

488
00:37:20,907 --> 00:37:22,740
In order to force them in,
to accept..

489
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:24,865
Sir! Sir!
- What happened?

490
00:37:27,324 --> 00:37:28,407
Hear everybody!

491
00:37:28,949 --> 00:37:30,615
On the annual day celebration..

492
00:37:30,699 --> 00:37:32,782
..there will be a musical
competition.

493
00:37:33,115 --> 00:37:34,407
Students who want to participate..

494
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:36,324
..they can enroll their names.

495
00:37:39,699 --> 00:37:40,782
Take it!

496
00:37:41,657 --> 00:37:45,324
Radha, who else will participate
besides you from our class?

497
00:37:45,657 --> 00:37:46,740
It's a golden chance.

498
00:37:47,115 --> 00:37:48,949
Who has already started singing?

499
00:37:50,407 --> 00:37:52,407
Silence! Back to your books.

500
00:38:11,032 --> 00:38:12,115
What are you doing?

501
00:38:15,532 --> 00:38:16,615
Radha! Radha!

502
00:38:18,074 --> 00:38:20,907
Flower!
- It's yours!

503
00:38:25,532 --> 00:38:26,099
Thanks!

504
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:29,574
Pardon me, Radha. I want to
tell you something. - Yes.

505
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:32,407
I want to ask you, are
you participating..

506
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:34,490
..in the musical competition?

507
00:38:34,907 --> 00:38:38,324
Yes. Do you mind?
- No. I don't mind.

508
00:38:38,865 --> 00:38:41,407
I just want to say that if
you are participating..

509
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:44,324
..then I will withdraw my name.

510
00:38:45,532 --> 00:38:47,949
Why? Are you so scared of losing?

511
00:38:48,157 --> 00:38:50,824
What? I am not afraid of losing.
I am afraid of winning.

512
00:38:51,324 --> 00:38:53,949
I think you don't know that
I am a good singer.

513
00:38:54,824 --> 00:38:57,865
I have a sweet voice.
- I can see that.

514
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:02,074
What? My friends say that
I am Tansen's incarnation.

515
00:39:05,532 --> 00:39:06,615
Look, don't laugh.

516
00:39:07,157 --> 00:39:10,115
Of course, your smile
is really beautiful.

517
00:39:10,449 --> 00:39:14,324
But I thought you were mocking
this Tansen.

518
00:39:15,074 --> 00:39:17,532
Not Tansen! Tansen's incarnation!

519
00:39:18,532 --> 00:39:20,657
I am fortunate that I met you.

520
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:25,324
Who is fortunate? I will
tell you that in leisure.

521
00:39:25,949 --> 00:39:29,865
By the way, for now I want to say
that I will really regret if..

522
00:39:30,324 --> 00:39:31,574
If you lost?

523
00:39:32,615 --> 00:39:34,407
No! If I won.

524
00:39:35,115 --> 00:39:37,865
Look, I can't tolerate your defeat.

525
00:39:38,574 --> 00:39:43,149
Can I even dream of me
winning and you losing?

526
00:39:44,157 --> 00:39:49,699
Never! So I have decided that
I will give this sacrifice!

527
00:39:51,324 --> 00:39:54,907
What is a minor award
in front of you?

528
00:39:55,782 --> 00:39:58,885
Oh! I think you are not just
Tansen's incarnation..

529
00:39:58,885 --> 00:40:02,385
..but you are benevolent
Harishchandra's incarnation too!

530
00:40:02,485 --> 00:40:04,110
I mean two incarnations.

531
00:40:05,402 --> 00:40:07,402
By the way, no need to
give the sacrifice.

532
00:40:07,485 --> 00:40:10,110
You can surely participate.
And then lose.

533
00:40:22,652 --> 00:40:23,860
What are you looking at, Gopi?

534
00:40:24,652 --> 00:40:28,194
Madam, smile! Why did
you stop? Madam, smile!

535
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,403
Why?

536
00:40:29,695 --> 00:40:34,111
Do you know how does it feel
when you smile? - How?

537
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:38,277
Like.. like.. sweet melody
of one string sitar.

538
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:43,277
And the way the breeze
makes a noise..

539
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:47,069
..when it blows over bamboo jungle.

540
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:50,444
Just like that, madam!
Just like that!

541
00:40:50,985 --> 00:40:54,694
I used to think that you
just oar the boat.

542
00:40:55,195 --> 00:40:56,570
But you even recite poems.

543
00:40:57,902 --> 00:40:59,902
Poems? What's that, madam?

544
00:41:00,695 --> 00:41:03,903
You don't know poem? Poem
means songs, music.

545
00:41:04,985 --> 00:41:06,819
I remembered! Listen, Gopi!

546
00:41:06,902 --> 00:41:09,860
You know so many songs.
Teach me one too.

547
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:13,445
I and song? What are
you saying, madam?

548
00:41:13,527 --> 00:41:16,944
No, Gopi. There is a musical
competition in our college.

549
00:41:17,277 --> 00:41:19,777
You teach me a nice song.
I will sing it.

550
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,944
You will sing my song
in your college.

551
00:41:22,277 --> 00:41:24,444
Along with me, you will make your
mockery too. Great, madam!

552
00:41:25,195 --> 00:41:27,195
I will be mocked when I lose.

553
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:30,360
You can never lose!

554
00:41:30,695 --> 00:41:32,320
How can anybody dare
to defeat madam?

555
00:41:33,527 --> 00:41:35,277
If you won't teach me then
this is what will happen.

556
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:38,944
You will teach me, won't you?

557
00:41:40,695 --> 00:41:41,778
Madam!

558
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:44,778
Now don't act smugly.
Tomorrow is Sunday.

559
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,194
Come home at 10 in the morning.

560
00:41:46,485 --> 00:41:48,110
To your house? - Yes!

561
00:41:51,277 --> 00:41:52,360
What are you thinking?

562
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:57,778
Madam, I am wondering whether
you are fooling me.

563
00:41:59,195 --> 00:42:00,278
Fool!

564
00:42:58,402 --> 00:43:00,360
Look, Gauri. Today don't
quarrel. Okay.

565
00:43:05,695 --> 00:43:08,570
Gopi, is it Dussera
(festival) today?

566
00:43:10,402 --> 00:43:11,485
No!

567
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:14,278
So why have you dressed up so well?

568
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:18,402
Where are you going all decked up?

569
00:43:18,485 --> 00:43:20,402
I can go anywhere. Why
do you want to know?

570
00:43:22,195 --> 00:43:24,111
If not me, then who else
would want to know?

571
00:43:24,195 --> 00:43:25,778
You don't have anybody in
this world besides me!

572
00:43:26,195 --> 00:43:27,695
Is that so?
- Yes!

573
00:43:28,527 --> 00:43:30,902
Gauri!
- Yes! Tell me!

574
00:43:31,277 --> 00:43:33,027
These goats!
- Yes!

575
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,444
They too don't have anybody
in this world besides you.

576
00:43:35,527 --> 00:43:37,319
Go! Take them for grazing! Go!

577
00:43:37,402 --> 00:43:39,027
No! First tell me where
are you going?

578
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:40,985
What are you doing? You
will crumple my clothes!

579
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:43,445
I will crumple your clothes!

580
00:43:43,527 --> 00:43:45,319
Such a pretty girl is standing
in front of you!

581
00:43:45,402 --> 00:43:46,485
You don't care!

582
00:43:46,652 --> 00:43:48,610
And you are so proud of
your ordinary clothes!

583
00:43:48,695 --> 00:43:50,278
What are you doing? I will beat you!

584
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,277
No, first tell me!
- I won't tell you!

585
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,402
Tell me!
- I won't! I won't! I won't!

586
00:43:55,652 --> 00:44:00,694
What is this? You both
always quarrel!

587
00:44:00,777 --> 00:44:02,777
Look, grandma. She
always harasses me.

588
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:05,652
That's why I tell her
to get married.

589
00:44:05,735 --> 00:44:07,569
Then you both won't quarrel.

590
00:44:07,652 --> 00:44:08,902
Marry?
- Yes!

591
00:44:08,985 --> 00:44:10,110
And that too this ugly girl!

592
00:44:11,195 --> 00:44:13,320
You won't find a better
girl than me.

593
00:44:13,402 --> 00:44:16,485
Get lost! Is there no other
girl in this village?

594
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,527
So much of ego!

595
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:20,653
Then what!

596
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:22,194
Hey! Hey, Gopi!

597
00:44:22,277 --> 00:44:24,402
Gopi! Why do you pluck my flower?
- Get lost!

598
00:44:24,485 --> 00:44:28,402
Look, grandma. Everyday
he gives flower to madam.

599
00:44:28,485 --> 00:44:32,402
Only on Sunday I get a flower.
I won't give my flower.

600
00:44:32,485 --> 00:44:33,569
Look, Gauri.

601
00:44:33,652 --> 00:44:35,985
Will it look good to go empty
handed at madam's house?

602
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:41,111
I see! So this is the case! So
you are going to madam's place.

603
00:44:41,195 --> 00:44:43,195
Yes, Gauri. Give me the flower.

604
00:44:43,277 --> 00:44:45,902
No matter what! I won't
give it to you!

605
00:44:45,985 --> 00:44:47,527
Don't give me! Go to hell!

606
00:44:50,945 --> 00:44:55,195
Grandma, look! White crows!
Come quickly! Run! Run!

607
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,319
Where?
- Come quickly!

608
00:44:57,402 --> 00:44:59,027
Come here!
- Where?

609
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:00,402
Look, do you see that cloud?
- Yes.

610
00:45:00,485 --> 00:45:02,569
It's flying below it.

611
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:07,027
Look closely.
- Okay.

612
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:08,194
Saw that?

613
00:45:11,195 --> 00:45:12,528
I can't see it.

614
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:14,360
Look in your hand.

615
00:45:18,277 --> 00:45:20,694
My flower! Look, grandma.

616
00:45:23,195 --> 00:45:25,111
Come, Gopi.
- Madam!

617
00:45:28,902 --> 00:45:31,860
Gopi, why do you always
bring flower for me?

618
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:35,278
Madam, this flower blossoms for you.

619
00:45:35,902 --> 00:45:37,360
For me? How so?

620
00:45:37,695 --> 00:45:39,278
That's the surprising thing, madam!

621
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,277
Every morning only one
flower blossoms..

622
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,819
..in my courtyard.

623
00:45:43,902 --> 00:45:44,985
Never two.

624
00:45:45,735 --> 00:45:49,402
Yes. And there is only one madam.

625
00:45:55,277 --> 00:45:56,360
Sit, Gopi.

626
00:45:59,485 --> 00:46:00,569
Sit!

627
00:46:12,485 --> 00:46:14,527
What is this, Gopi? Sit up.

628
00:46:15,277 --> 00:46:18,569
No, madam. A person should
sit as per his stature.

629
00:46:19,652 --> 00:46:20,735
Fine.

630
00:46:21,277 --> 00:46:23,485
Madam, what are you doing?

631
00:46:23,985 --> 00:46:26,277
A person should sit
as per his stature.

632
00:46:26,902 --> 00:46:28,985
A student is not above his guru.

633
00:46:29,070 --> 00:46:31,195
What?
- Yes.

634
00:46:31,652 --> 00:46:33,277
Today you have come to teach me.

635
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:34,527
So you are my guru.

636
00:46:34,985 --> 00:46:39,069
I am your guru. Madam, you
are embarrassing me.

637
00:46:39,735 --> 00:46:43,402
I am an illiterate man.
I only oar the boat.

638
00:46:43,485 --> 00:46:45,527
Enough! Enough! Now teach me.

639
00:46:46,485 --> 00:46:50,402
Okay, madam. I will sing
and you memorize it.

640
00:46:50,485 --> 00:46:51,569
So sing.

641
00:46:54,445 --> 00:46:57,736
Look, madam. Don't laugh.
I have a hoarse voice.

642
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:59,611
Now do begin, guru.

643
00:47:14,945 --> 00:47:18,278
"Its monsoon season."

644
00:47:18,695 --> 00:47:22,653
"The breeze is making a noise."

645
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:26,819
"Its monsoon season."

646
00:47:27,277 --> 00:47:31,194
"The breeze is making a noise."

647
00:47:32,070 --> 00:47:33,153
No!

648
00:47:33,277 --> 00:47:37,277
"The breeze is making a noise."

649
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:41,277
"The breeze is making a noise."

650
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:45,485
Not Shor (noise). It's Sor. Sor.

651
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:49,819
"The breeze is making a noise."

652
00:47:49,902 --> 00:47:50,500
Yes!

653
00:47:50,599 --> 00:47:53,402
"My heart sways."

654
00:47:53,485 --> 00:47:57,527
"The way peacock dances
in the jungle."

655
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:04,027
"Its monsoon season."

656
00:48:04,110 --> 00:48:07,360
"The breeze is making a noise."

657
00:48:07,695 --> 00:48:10,278
"My heart sways."

658
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:14,027
"The way peacock dances
in the jungle."

659
00:48:17,695 --> 00:48:20,611
"Its monsoon season."

660
00:48:20,695 --> 00:48:24,195
"The breeze is making a noise."

661
00:48:24,445 --> 00:48:27,278
"My heart sways."

662
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:30,819
"The way peacock dances
in the jungle."

663
00:48:55,277 --> 00:49:01,319
"The breeze is very harsh."

664
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:04,903
"Handle your boat."

665
00:49:04,985 --> 00:49:07,819
"Where are you lost, oarsman?"

666
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:14,195
"The breeze is very harsh."

667
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:17,277
"Handle your boat."

668
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:20,360
"Where are you lost, oarsman?"

669
00:49:20,445 --> 00:49:27,028
"I am helpless in front
of the breeze."

670
00:49:27,402 --> 00:49:30,027
"My heart sways."

671
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:33,444
"The way peacock dances
in the jungle."

672
00:49:37,195 --> 00:49:39,903
"Its monsoon season."

673
00:49:40,195 --> 00:49:43,486
"The breeze is making a noise."

674
00:49:43,985 --> 00:49:46,402
"My heart sways."

675
00:49:46,652 --> 00:49:50,277
"The way peacock dances
in the jungle."

676
00:50:17,695 --> 00:50:23,986
"I don't know what signs the
waves are giving to me."

677
00:50:24,277 --> 00:50:30,194
"The river's waves are asking
where you want to go."

678
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:36,611
"I don't know what signs the
waves are giving to me."

679
00:50:37,195 --> 00:50:42,778
"The river's waves are asking
where you want to go."

680
00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:49,194
"It's your wish. You can
take me anywhere."

681
00:50:49,695 --> 00:50:52,195
"My heart sways."

682
00:50:52,277 --> 00:50:56,110
"The way peacock dances
in the jungle."

683
00:50:59,527 --> 00:51:02,110
"Its monsoon season."

684
00:51:02,195 --> 00:51:05,778
"The breeze is making a noise."

685
00:51:06,195 --> 00:51:08,445
"My heart sways."

686
00:51:08,527 --> 00:51:12,402
"The way peacock dances
in the jungle."

687
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:36,402
"Those whose beloveds
have gone aboard."

688
00:51:36,985 --> 00:51:42,652
"It has brought the
message of love."

689
00:51:43,277 --> 00:51:49,194
"Those whose beloveds
have gone aboard."

690
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:55,195
"It has brought the
message of love."

691
00:51:55,320 --> 00:52:01,861
"Black clouds have gathered."

692
00:52:02,195 --> 00:52:04,570
"My heart sways."

693
00:52:04,652 --> 00:52:08,319
"The way peacock dances
in the jungle."

694
00:52:12,027 --> 00:52:14,944
"Its monsoon season."

695
00:52:15,027 --> 00:52:18,277
"The breeze is making a noise."

696
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:20,985
"My heart sways."

697
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:24,570
"The way peacock dances
in the jungle."

698
00:52:24,652 --> 00:52:27,527
"My heart sways."

699
00:52:27,610 --> 00:52:31,444
"The way peacock dances
in the jungle."

700
00:52:33,195 --> 00:52:34,278
Wonderful!

701
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:36,777
Beautiful! Terrific!

702
00:52:37,195 --> 00:52:40,195
You were too good!
- Thank you.

703
00:52:42,445 --> 00:52:43,695
Congratulations, Radha.

704
00:52:44,777 --> 00:52:48,444
I was waiting for the
crowd to disperse.

705
00:52:49,195 --> 00:52:50,820
So that I could congratulate you.
And to take your thanks.

706
00:52:51,277 --> 00:52:52,485
Thanks?

707
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:56,278
Yes. I withdrew my name
from the competition.

708
00:52:56,360 --> 00:53:00,402
In return of the sacrifice
I deserve thanks.

709
00:53:02,195 --> 00:53:03,278
Right, Radha?

710
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:06,110
Oh! Thank you so much.

711
00:53:06,902 --> 00:53:08,944
This is not enough.
- Then?

712
00:53:09,777 --> 00:53:12,444
I too want something in return.
- In return?

713
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,277
You gave a sacrifice and you
want something in return.

714
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:19,195
I thought you are benevolent
Harishchandra's incarnation.

715
00:53:20,027 --> 00:53:23,110
Now I understood that you
are a modern incarnation.

716
00:53:23,485 --> 00:53:27,652
So tell me, in return I will have
to withdraw my name from where?

717
00:53:28,027 --> 00:53:30,360
Not withdraw. You will have
to attach it with my name.

718
00:53:33,735 --> 00:53:35,360
I will explain to you
when the time is right.

719
00:53:35,445 --> 00:53:37,028
I mean.. I mean..

720
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:38,610
So you wait for the right time.

721
00:53:45,277 --> 00:53:47,485
What is this, madam?
What have you done?

722
00:53:47,570 --> 00:53:48,986
Why did you give me the garland?

723
00:53:49,902 --> 00:53:52,027
This is not just a garland,
Gopi. This is victory.

724
00:53:52,402 --> 00:53:55,735
Because of you. You
deserve to wear it.

725
00:53:56,195 --> 00:53:56,890
Do you know?

726
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,610
Your song was considered the
best in the competition.

727
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:03,611
What are you saying, madam?
You must have sung well.

728
00:54:03,695 --> 00:54:05,278
You taught me so well, Gopi.

729
00:54:08,027 --> 00:54:11,819
Madam, I don't know how
I am feeling today.

730
00:54:13,027 --> 00:54:14,402
I don't know how I am feeling.

731
00:54:14,985 --> 00:54:16,152
What are you feeling?

732
00:54:16,485 --> 00:54:19,944
Very nice. Everything feels so nice.

733
00:54:23,027 --> 00:54:27,110
Madam, how to say in English
I am really happy.

734
00:54:27,195 --> 00:54:28,778
I am grateful to you.

735
00:54:31,277 --> 00:54:32,444
Tell me, madam.

736
00:54:33,695 --> 00:54:37,278
So say.. I am very happy.
Thank you very much.

737
00:54:37,695 --> 00:54:41,778
Madam, this is so big. Say
something short. Crisp.

738
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:44,527
So say, thank you very much.

739
00:54:45,277 --> 00:54:49,402
Madam, this too is very long. But
I will try. Say it once more.

740
00:54:49,485 --> 00:54:50,902
Thank you very much.

741
00:54:52,527 --> 00:54:57,194
Thank you.. thank you..
- Enough!

742
00:54:58,110 --> 00:54:59,735
Thank you, madam! Thank you!

743
00:55:00,777 --> 00:55:04,694
Gopi Kisan! Gopi Kisan!

744
00:55:08,277 --> 00:55:09,819
What new form is this?

745
00:55:10,277 --> 00:55:11,819
Have you participated in archery?

746
00:55:11,902 --> 00:55:13,610
Which Sita gave you the garland?

747
00:55:13,695 --> 00:55:15,361
Now let me wear it!

748
00:55:15,445 --> 00:55:17,278
Gauri! Don't touch the garland!

749
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:18,485
Give me!

750
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:19,820
I will break your hand!

751
00:55:20,902 --> 00:55:22,694
As if you will wear it forever!

752
00:55:22,777 --> 00:55:27,694
In two days all the flowers will
wither. Then what will you do?

753
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:32,110
Gauri, flowers will wither.

754
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:37,569
But the thread which binds it
together will not perish.

755
00:55:38,695 --> 00:55:43,195
Yes! The thread won't perish!
It keeps the flowers together.

756
00:55:43,277 --> 00:55:46,277
But madam, it's futile
to tell this girl.

757
00:55:46,695 --> 00:55:48,570
She doesn't have brains
that she will understand.

758
00:55:48,652 --> 00:55:50,902
What did you say? I am a fool?
- Yes!

759
00:55:51,277 --> 00:55:54,569
Oh! I won't talk to you!
- I too won't talk to you!

760
00:55:54,652 --> 00:55:56,694
I won't talk to you
in this lifetime!

761
00:55:56,777 --> 00:55:59,527
I won't ever sit in your boat.
I am leaving. - Go!

762
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:04,403
Come on, Jaggu! Push harder!

763
00:56:04,485 --> 00:56:06,902
Our boat should be ahead
of his boat. Yes!

764
00:56:06,985 --> 00:56:09,860
Is that so? How did
you change today?

765
00:56:10,527 --> 00:56:12,902
Gopi, why did you upset her?

766
00:56:12,985 --> 00:56:15,944
Let it be, madam. She is mad.

767
00:56:20,570 --> 00:56:22,945
Help! Help! Help! Help!

768
00:56:23,027 --> 00:56:24,110
Get lost!

769
00:56:31,402 --> 00:56:34,277
Gauri, you are a brilliant girl!

770
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:41,570
Jhansi's Queen, Meera. You are
above all of them. Above them.

771
00:56:41,902 --> 00:56:43,652
Is that so?
- Yes.

772
00:56:43,735 --> 00:56:48,194
Sir too was saying this.
- Sir? Who?

773
00:56:48,277 --> 00:56:52,610
Landlord's brother-in-law.
That day he sat in my boat.

774
00:56:52,695 --> 00:56:54,361
Oh! That man!

775
00:56:56,485 --> 00:56:58,110
He was praising you a lot.

776
00:56:58,402 --> 00:57:04,194
He said.. he said.. he is
a nice man. Poor guy.

777
00:57:04,485 --> 00:57:05,569
Is he dead?

778
00:57:06,652 --> 00:57:08,944
No. But he will die.

779
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:11,278
When the ailment is so terrifying..

780
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:12,349
..then who can survive?

781
00:57:12,494 --> 00:57:13,786
Is that so?
- Yes!

782
00:57:13,869 --> 00:57:15,036
So this is the matter.
- What?

783
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:17,411
What are you doing?
- Shameless! Ruffian!

784
00:57:17,494 --> 00:57:20,244
You have started a new profession!

785
00:57:20,536 --> 00:57:21,619
Shameless!

786
00:57:21,702 --> 00:57:23,411
Gauri, what happened?

787
00:57:23,494 --> 00:57:26,327
Help!
- I will wear gold bangles!

788
00:57:26,411 --> 00:57:28,161
I will rule!
- Gauri!

789
00:57:28,244 --> 00:57:30,327
What's the matter, Gauri?
- O my God!

790
00:57:30,827 --> 00:57:33,952
Look, he talks so cheaply!
- Gauri, no!

791
00:57:34,036 --> 00:57:38,869
If you again dared to say this
then I won't spare you! Got it?

792
00:57:39,494 --> 00:57:41,161
Come quickly. Come!

793
00:57:43,244 --> 00:57:44,369
Come! Sit!

794
00:57:46,036 --> 00:57:47,661
Why did you let me take his boat?

795
00:57:47,744 --> 00:57:50,577
Look at this! You only had gone
there! When did I tell you?

796
00:57:51,536 --> 00:57:53,077
But why didn't you stop me?

797
00:57:53,161 --> 00:57:56,536
Look, madam. There is a
saying in our village.

798
00:57:56,911 --> 00:57:59,161
When you are embarrassed,
you hide your face.

799
00:57:59,327 --> 00:58:00,661
This girl's plight too is the same.

800
00:58:00,744 --> 00:58:01,994
What did you say? A fool!

801
00:58:02,077 --> 00:58:04,952
Look, madam! Again he
is calling me a fool!

802
00:58:05,036 --> 00:58:06,119
Gopi!

803
00:58:06,327 --> 00:58:08,327
No, madam! When did I say that?

804
00:58:08,536 --> 00:58:12,702
I say.. this girl is very good.

805
00:58:13,327 --> 00:58:15,244
This girl is very good!

806
00:58:20,927 --> 00:58:22,010
What happened to you?

807
00:58:22,094 --> 00:58:23,427
Why are you limping?

808
00:58:24,677 --> 00:58:26,927
Who is limping? I have
just sprained my leg.

809
00:58:27,010 --> 00:58:29,260
And you are saying why
are you limping?

810
00:58:29,302 --> 00:58:30,677
You are saying you have
sprained your leg.

811
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:32,177
There are marks on your body.

812
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:33,344
Tell me. What happened?

813
00:58:33,427 --> 00:58:36,344
If I earn, I have to tell you.

814
00:58:36,427 --> 00:58:38,594
If I don't earn, still
I have to tell you.

815
00:58:38,677 --> 00:58:39,802
Beating..

816
00:58:40,010 --> 00:58:42,760
I mean whatever I do,
I have to tell you.

817
00:58:42,844 --> 00:58:49,260
Tell me. What happened?
Did somebody beat you?

818
00:58:49,344 --> 00:58:50,427
What did you say?

819
00:58:51,052 --> 00:58:53,469
Can anybody dare to
raise hands on Jaggu?

820
00:58:53,552 --> 00:58:56,385
Such a man has not been
born in this world.

821
00:58:56,719 --> 00:58:59,135
So did a woman beat you?

822
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:06,635
A woman? Rajjo, at times I
let you beat me lovingly.

823
00:59:06,719 --> 00:59:09,010
Otherwise nobody can
dare to do this.

824
00:59:09,094 --> 00:59:14,510
I am only short. Otherwise I would
have been a navy captain.

825
00:59:14,594 --> 00:59:16,677
Go and quickly bring warm water.
- Okay.

826
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,052
Hurry up.
- I will just get it.

827
00:59:18,135 --> 00:59:19,219
O my God!

828
00:59:20,010 --> 00:59:23,010
It's hurting. I will keep a hot bag.

829
00:59:23,094 --> 00:59:26,594
O my God! She didn't pity me at all.

830
00:59:26,927 --> 00:59:28,552
She beat me so badly.

831
00:59:28,719 --> 00:59:30,594
Tell me. What happened?

832
00:59:31,344 --> 00:59:36,344
Rajjo, don't be afraid. A
terrible thing occurred.

833
00:59:36,427 --> 00:59:38,760
What? What happened?

834
00:59:38,844 --> 00:59:40,677
That same fishes' affair!

835
00:59:41,427 --> 00:59:45,760
A big fish hit my boat. And
it turned upside down.

836
00:59:45,844 --> 00:59:48,010
And I fell in the water.
- Is that so?

837
00:59:48,094 --> 00:59:54,552
Yes! I see big alligators,
big fishes.

838
00:59:54,635 --> 00:59:57,094
They are in front of me with
their mouth open. - Then?

839
00:59:57,385 --> 00:59:59,635
I too faced them bravely.
- Okay.

840
00:59:59,719 --> 01:00:01,760
And I thrashed all of them.
- Okay.

841
01:00:02,094 --> 01:00:05,760
A big crocodile arrived.
- Okay.

842
01:00:05,844 --> 01:00:09,927
It took a deep breathe.. and
I entered his stomach.

843
01:00:11,427 --> 01:00:12,677
Stomach!

844
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:15,135
O my God! Now what will happen?

845
01:00:15,219 --> 01:00:19,135
Listen! I took out a knife
from my pocket. - Knife.

846
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:23,052
Knife used to chop vegetables.
-  But that was at home.

847
01:00:23,135 --> 01:00:25,719
If not that then something else.

848
01:00:25,802 --> 01:00:27,594
You are an illiterate woman.

849
01:00:27,677 --> 01:00:29,927
Is there a dearth of
knives in village?

850
01:00:30,344 --> 01:00:34,677
I cut the crocodile's stomach
and I came out. - Good!

851
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:36,010
I see..

852
01:00:36,677 --> 01:00:38,552
There is still problem.
- Why?

853
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:40,760
A big fish is coming.

854
01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:46,219
That was not a fish, Jaggu.
She was a serpent.

855
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:48,094
You survived.

856
01:00:48,344 --> 01:00:51,635
Otherwise today she wouldn't
have spared you.

857
01:00:52,052 --> 01:00:55,677
Gauri! You were there.

858
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:58,677
Yes, I was standing there
and watching it.

859
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:00,760
Give me 2 rupees. I
will bring sweets.

860
01:01:00,844 --> 01:01:02,760
We will offer it in the temple.

861
01:01:03,010 --> 01:01:06,594
Okay! Gauri, first let
me give him hot water.

862
01:01:06,677 --> 01:01:08,302
Then I too will come to
the temple with you.

863
01:01:08,385 --> 01:01:09,510
Okay. Hurry up.

864
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:11,844
Gauri.
- Yes.

865
01:01:13,010 --> 01:01:16,677
I will be grateful to you.
Don't say anything else.

866
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:18,927
Otherwise I will have
to fast tonight.

867
01:01:20,552 --> 01:01:24,719
Jaggu.. can aunt do that?

868
01:01:25,010 --> 01:01:27,677
She will surely give
you something to eat.

869
01:01:28,052 --> 01:01:30,635
Eat it. Otherwise beating.

870
01:01:30,719 --> 01:01:31,927
Beating?
- Yes.

871
01:01:32,302 --> 01:01:35,427
If you ever did this again then..
- No, Gauri!

872
01:01:35,510 --> 01:01:39,969
I won't do this again. I swear.
I won't do this again.

873
01:01:41,344 --> 01:01:42,927
Give, aunt. Give.

874
01:01:45,010 --> 01:01:46,344
You sit properly.

875
01:01:47,094 --> 01:01:51,344
Jaggu, where did the fish hit you?

876
01:01:51,677 --> 01:01:52,760
Here.

877
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:56,760
O my God! My skin has burnt!

878
01:01:56,844 --> 01:01:59,927
So what, Jaggu? You
will get a new skin.

879
01:02:00,010 --> 01:02:01,344
And the scars will heal.

880
01:02:01,427 --> 01:02:05,302
Gauri, you don't listen
to him. Do it properly.

881
01:02:05,385 --> 01:02:06,802
Okay. I will just do it.

882
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:08,844
It's very hot.

883
01:02:08,927 --> 01:02:11,010
O God! O God! O God!

884
01:02:11,094 --> 01:02:12,094
Sit!

885
01:02:12,177 --> 01:02:13,260
Quiet!

886
01:02:21,010 --> 01:02:22,094
Madam!

887
01:02:24,052 --> 01:02:27,344
Gopi, I heard that you will
dance in tomorrow's feast.

888
01:02:27,427 --> 01:02:30,010
Madam, will you come to watch it?

889
01:02:30,844 --> 01:02:34,344
Why? If I won't come, you
won't sing or dance?

890
01:02:42,344 --> 01:02:44,427
What happened, madam?
- The flower fell in the water.

891
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:48,177
Wait! I will get it.
- No, Gopi! Let it be!

892
01:02:50,010 --> 01:02:51,094
Gopi!

893
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:04,552
Gopi! Let it be, Gopi!

894
01:03:07,719 --> 01:03:10,094
Gopi! Come back!

895
01:03:35,344 --> 01:03:37,677
Fool! What if something
had happened to you?

896
01:03:38,469 --> 01:03:41,510
Madam, does a mother let anything
happen to her son?

897
01:03:41,719 --> 01:03:45,010
Ganga is my mother. I am her son.

898
01:03:51,070 --> 01:03:52,000
What is this, Gopi?

899
01:03:53,094 --> 01:03:55,594
You shouldn't place the flower
at somebody's feet.

900
01:03:56,510 --> 01:03:59,469
You offer flowers at Gods
and Goddess' feet.

901
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:05,552
I swear, madam.

902
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:11,594
Gopi! Why do you like me so much?

903
01:04:12,385 --> 01:04:13,719
Madam!

904
01:04:30,094 --> 01:04:33,260
Gopi! Gopi!

905
01:04:33,635 --> 01:04:35,802
Gopi Kisan!
- What are you doing?

906
01:04:36,927 --> 01:04:39,260
Shall I tell you something?
- Yes! Tell me quickly!

907
01:04:39,344 --> 01:04:42,135
But open your mouth. Don't move
your leg. Keep it straight.

908
01:04:42,219 --> 01:04:43,302
Okay.

909
01:04:44,010 --> 01:04:48,760
Now when you have held my
leg then ask for something.

910
01:04:48,844 --> 01:04:50,094
I won't refuse.

911
01:04:50,177 --> 01:04:53,177
I should ask for something.
You won't refuse.

912
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:55,552
Yes. Don't feel shy.

913
01:04:56,552 --> 01:04:58,260
Here only we both are there.

914
01:04:58,844 --> 01:05:03,302
Say that you want to marry
me. I will say yes.

915
01:05:03,844 --> 01:05:05,719
Come on! Keep your leg straight!

916
01:05:06,094 --> 01:05:09,469
Otherwise I will break your bones.

917
01:05:10,010 --> 01:05:11,802
You will break my bones.

918
01:05:13,177 --> 01:05:15,344
Are you that strong?

919
01:05:16,010 --> 01:05:18,260
Shall I show you?

920
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:26,719
Wait! You show it later. First
let me see what I am seeing.

921
01:05:37,135 --> 01:05:38,635
Why are you laughing?

922
01:05:38,719 --> 01:05:39,927
What else should I do?

923
01:05:40,302 --> 01:05:44,635
That landlord's brother-in-law
was staring at me!

924
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:52,302
I too hit him with catapult.
And he ran away.

925
01:05:52,385 --> 01:05:56,427
Gauri, don't lock horns with
him. He is a bad man.

926
01:05:57,385 --> 01:06:00,552
If he is a bad man then
I am not a Goddess.

927
01:06:00,635 --> 01:06:01,927
Like a lousy woman
I go after somebody..

928
01:06:02,010 --> 01:06:04,052
..and I don't spare him.

929
01:06:05,052 --> 01:06:07,927
I see that everyday, Gauri.
- What did you say?

930
01:06:08,010 --> 01:06:11,010
What have you done?
You ruined my work!

931
01:06:11,927 --> 01:06:14,302
So what? Do it again.

932
01:06:14,385 --> 01:06:18,052
Yes! Do it again! As if I
am your slave! Get lost!

933
01:06:18,135 --> 01:06:20,010
Fine! Let it be!
- Go away!

934
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:23,219
Gauri, will you go in
the feast like this?

935
01:06:23,302 --> 01:06:25,594
Yes! I will go like this!
It's my wish!

936
01:06:25,677 --> 01:06:25,719
You are so proud! to
break your pride..

937
01:06:25,719 --> 01:06:27,719
So much of pride!

938
01:06:28,010 --> 01:06:32,344
You should get an ugly husband
so that your ego breaks!

939
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:36,927
I have already found him!

940
01:06:38,177 --> 01:06:39,260
Who is he?

941
01:06:39,927 --> 01:06:44,344
Get lost! I won't tell
you! I feel shy!

942
01:06:44,427 --> 01:06:48,635
You are feeling shy!
Tell me, who is he?

943
01:06:50,094 --> 01:06:51,260
I won't tell you!

944
01:06:51,344 --> 01:06:52,510
Tell me! Who is he?

945
01:06:52,594 --> 01:06:55,219
I won't tell you! I won't
tell you! I won't tell you!

946
01:06:55,302 --> 01:06:59,677
Gauri! Gauri! Tell me! Who is he?

947
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:02,760
Gauri! Listen!

948
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:09,344
Gauri! You forgot this!
Take it! Take it!

949
01:09:07,136 --> 01:09:08,928
"Tell me, damsel."

950
01:09:09,011 --> 01:09:10,845
"Who is your beloved?"

951
01:09:11,802 --> 01:09:13,595
"Tell me, damsel."

952
01:09:13,677 --> 01:09:15,345
"Who is your beloved?"

953
01:09:16,261 --> 01:09:20,761
"Who is the one whom you love?"

954
01:09:20,845 --> 01:09:22,552
"Tell me, damsel."

955
01:09:22,636 --> 01:09:24,261
"Who is your beloved?"

956
01:09:24,345 --> 01:09:27,095
"You don't know his name!"

957
01:09:27,177 --> 01:09:34,260
"People take his name
dawn and dusk."

958
01:09:34,345 --> 01:09:35,552
"You tell me."

959
01:09:36,511 --> 01:09:38,261
"You tell me."

960
01:09:38,345 --> 01:09:40,220
"Who is my beloved?"

961
01:09:41,011 --> 01:09:42,678
"Tell me, damsel."

962
01:09:42,761 --> 01:09:44,470
"Who is your beloved?"

963
01:10:12,052 --> 01:10:17,927
"Who is better than
the whole world?"

964
01:10:18,761 --> 01:10:23,303
"Who is better than
the whole world?"

965
01:10:23,386 --> 01:10:27,595
"Describe him."

966
01:10:27,677 --> 01:10:31,927
"He is innocent."

967
01:10:32,011 --> 01:10:36,261
"He is innocent."

968
01:10:36,345 --> 01:10:42,011
"He wears a necklace of serpent."

969
01:10:42,261 --> 01:10:44,553
"He has many forms."

970
01:10:44,636 --> 01:10:46,595
"At times shade. At times sunlight."

971
01:10:46,677 --> 01:10:51,552
"Is he your beloved or an impostor?"

972
01:10:51,636 --> 01:10:53,011
"Tell me, damsel."

973
01:10:53,761 --> 01:10:55,345
"Tell me, damsel."

974
01:10:55,427 --> 01:10:57,135
"Who is your beloved?"

975
01:10:58,011 --> 01:10:59,678
"You tell me."

976
01:10:59,761 --> 01:11:01,553
"Who is my beloved?"

977
01:11:31,011 --> 01:11:35,345
"His heart is temple."

978
01:11:35,427 --> 01:11:37,845
"And life a devotion."

979
01:11:39,636 --> 01:11:44,095
"His heart is temple."

980
01:11:44,177 --> 01:11:46,345
"And life a devotion."

981
01:11:46,427 --> 01:11:47,927
"Neither horse nor elephant."

982
01:11:48,011 --> 01:11:50,595
"Riding on the bullock."

983
01:11:50,677 --> 01:11:52,260
"Neither horse nor elephant."

984
01:11:52,345 --> 01:11:55,011
"Riding on the bullock."

985
01:11:55,345 --> 01:12:01,511
"He is the hermit of
Kailash mountain."

986
01:12:01,595 --> 01:12:05,345
"He is the fakir."

987
01:12:05,427 --> 01:12:07,677
"He is the fakir."

988
01:12:07,761 --> 01:12:09,720
"He is a fakir."

989
01:12:09,802 --> 01:12:16,677
"With his devotion he
liberates the world."

990
01:12:16,761 --> 01:12:18,178
"You tell me."

991
01:12:19,011 --> 01:12:20,511
"You tell me."

992
01:12:20,595 --> 01:12:22,470
"Who is my beloved?"

993
01:12:23,261 --> 01:12:24,928
"Tell me, damsel."

994
01:12:25,011 --> 01:12:26,678
"Who is your beloved?"

995
01:12:55,927 --> 01:13:01,470
"The one whom I love,
he should love me."

996
01:13:02,345 --> 01:13:06,552
"The one whom I love,
he should love me."

997
01:13:06,636 --> 01:13:10,928
"Tell me even a single flaw in him."

998
01:13:11,011 --> 01:13:15,095
"The one whom you love."

999
01:13:15,177 --> 01:13:19,260
"The one whom you love."

1000
01:13:19,345 --> 01:13:24,802
"Ganga dwells in his tresses."

1001
01:13:25,052 --> 01:13:27,095
"This companionship is short."

1002
01:13:27,177 --> 01:13:33,927
"But since ages if I am
wick then he is lamp."

1003
01:13:34,011 --> 01:13:35,345
"You tell me."

1004
01:13:36,011 --> 01:13:37,553
"You tell me."

1005
01:13:37,636 --> 01:13:39,428
"Who is my beloved?"

1006
01:13:40,345 --> 01:13:41,927
"You tell me."

1007
01:13:42,011 --> 01:13:44,345
"Who is my beloved?"

1008
01:13:44,427 --> 01:13:46,010
"You tell me."

1009
01:13:46,095 --> 01:13:47,927
"Who is my beloved?"

1010
01:14:44,927 --> 01:14:46,845
Are you catching fish?
- What?

1011
01:14:46,927 --> 01:14:48,927
Me too!
- What?

1012
01:14:49,011 --> 01:14:50,761
I too have come to catch fish.

1013
01:14:50,845 --> 01:14:52,427
Okay! So take this!

1014
01:14:56,095 --> 01:14:57,427
What are you looking at?

1015
01:14:57,511 --> 01:15:00,136
I am seeing the mixture
of sweet and salty!

1016
01:15:00,595 --> 01:15:02,595
Sweet and salty!

1017
01:15:02,677 --> 01:15:07,010
Yes! You sing sweetly! And
the singer is so salty!

1018
01:15:07,095 --> 01:15:08,177
What did you say?

1019
01:15:08,261 --> 01:15:12,011
I mean, Gauri, yesterday
your dance ruined me!

1020
01:15:12,095 --> 01:15:15,136
My heart is still mesmerized.

1021
01:15:16,011 --> 01:15:19,011
Is that so? Let me see!

1022
01:15:21,386 --> 01:15:25,345
O my God! Your heart
is beating so fast!

1023
01:15:25,427 --> 01:15:29,552
When you are in love, then
your heart beats fast!

1024
01:15:29,636 --> 01:15:31,345
Is that so?

1025
01:15:31,427 --> 01:15:35,302
Yes, Gauri. But yesterday that
illiterate Gopi spoilt the fun!

1026
01:15:35,386 --> 01:15:37,428
Do you know how he looked with you?

1027
01:15:37,511 --> 01:15:39,386
Like a crow with a swan.

1028
01:15:39,761 --> 01:15:41,928
Yes! If I had danced with
you, it would have..

1029
01:15:42,011 --> 01:15:44,600
..been like a pair
of peacock dancing.

1030
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:47,757
So you even know dancing.

1031
01:15:47,841 --> 01:15:50,424
Ask me what I don't know!
I am a city man.

1032
01:15:50,507 --> 01:15:52,675
Kathakpuri! Maniali! Bharatnatyam!

1033
01:15:52,757 --> 01:15:55,675
Kathak! And other dances too!

1034
01:16:00,341 --> 01:16:02,591
So Gauri, did you like my dance?

1035
01:16:03,216 --> 01:16:06,466
O my God! Itching plant!

1036
01:16:06,550 --> 01:16:07,757
Really nice!

1037
01:16:08,175 --> 01:16:14,050
Wow! I liked your dance
so much, it felt as if..

1038
01:16:14,132 --> 01:16:15,800
Sir is gone now.

1039
01:16:15,882 --> 01:16:17,050
It felt as if..

1040
01:16:18,882 --> 01:16:22,466
What is this? Itching! Itching!
Itching! - Yes!

1041
01:16:22,550 --> 01:16:24,882
Itching! Itching!

1042
01:16:24,966 --> 01:16:27,507
Now you can dance Kathakpuri
and Maniali!

1043
01:16:28,632 --> 01:16:30,050
Sir, I am coming! I am coming!

1044
01:16:30,132 --> 01:16:32,175
Sir, I am coming! Don't
worry! Don't worry!

1045
01:16:34,882 --> 01:16:36,216
Remove it! Remove it!

1046
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:38,132
No, sir! I can't remove this!

1047
01:16:38,216 --> 01:16:41,882
There is only one cure for this!
Dung! Buffaloes' dung!

1048
01:16:41,966 --> 01:16:44,466
Buffaloes' dung! Bring it quickly!

1049
01:16:44,550 --> 01:16:46,050
Bring it quickly!
- I will just get it, sir!

1050
01:16:46,132 --> 01:16:48,257
Sir, I can't get dung
without any money!

1051
01:16:48,341 --> 01:16:50,674
Take it! Take it! Take it!
- Shall I take it?

1052
01:16:50,757 --> 01:16:53,882
Okay, sir! You go on itching!
I will just get the dung!

1053
01:16:53,966 --> 01:16:56,216
Bring it quickly! Go!

1054
01:17:08,832 --> 01:17:11,582
Madam! Did you call me?

1055
01:17:11,667 --> 01:17:13,375
Yes, Gopi! Wait here!

1056
01:17:13,457 --> 01:17:16,375
Yes! My flower!
- Oh!

1057
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:18,832
Madam!

1058
01:17:28,332 --> 01:17:31,541
Take this!
- What is this, madam?

1059
01:17:31,625 --> 01:17:32,707
Open it and see!

1060
01:17:38,375 --> 01:17:41,707
Is all this for me?
- I can't wear this!

1061
01:17:42,250 --> 01:17:44,332
But madam..
- Liked it?

1062
01:17:45,125 --> 01:17:48,792
Tomorrow is your birthday.
This is my gift for you.

1063
01:17:54,250 --> 01:17:55,332
What happened?

1064
01:17:56,417 --> 01:18:03,667
Madam, I used to think nobody
cares if I am sad or happy..

1065
01:18:05,082 --> 01:18:07,250
..alive or dead.

1066
01:18:08,457 --> 01:18:09,875
Nobody cares.

1067
01:18:11,332 --> 01:18:15,250
But today.. seeing your attachment..

1068
01:18:15,332 --> 01:18:18,500
..I felt emotional.

1069
01:18:19,332 --> 01:18:21,041
So should you cry for this?

1070
01:18:26,292 --> 01:18:31,583
Madam, how did you remember
my birthday?

1071
01:18:33,332 --> 01:18:35,791
You don't forget to bring
flower for me everyday.

1072
01:18:36,332 --> 01:18:38,707
You don't forget to take
me across the river.

1073
01:18:39,625 --> 01:18:41,957
So how can I forget your birthday?

1074
01:18:43,750 --> 01:18:45,875
There is nobody like
you in this world.

1075
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:51,542
Gopi, how many old will
you be tomorrow?

1076
01:18:53,750 --> 01:18:55,292
What do I know, madam?

1077
01:18:57,125 --> 01:19:01,167
Is it right that you
are elder to me?

1078
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:03,250
Yes, madam. That is right.

1079
01:19:03,417 --> 01:19:06,250
Because mother Ganga told me..

1080
01:19:06,332 --> 01:19:08,875
..Gopi, take madam across the river.

1081
01:19:08,957 --> 01:19:10,457
You have to take her
to the other side.

1082
01:19:10,542 --> 01:19:13,458
And as a boatman, I came
on this earth before you.

1083
01:19:13,957 --> 01:19:19,000
Gopi, it feels as if in your
previous birth you were a poet.

1084
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:21,625
Poet? What is that, madam?

1085
01:19:21,707 --> 01:19:23,332
The one who writes poems.

1086
01:19:23,875 --> 01:19:26,332
Poem, meaning song. The
one who writes songs.

1087
01:19:26,417 --> 01:19:28,583
Yes. Like Valmiki. Kalidas.

1088
01:19:28,667 --> 01:19:32,125
Kalidas the same man who
was a shepherd. - Yes.

1089
01:19:32,332 --> 01:19:33,791
Then I am Kalidas.

1090
01:19:33,875 --> 01:19:35,250
I didn't become a shepherd because..

1091
01:19:35,332 --> 01:19:38,582
..madam needed a boatman and
not a shepherd in this birth.

1092
01:19:40,167 --> 01:19:43,000
I swear, madam. I swear on you.

1093
01:19:44,082 --> 01:19:45,166
Yes!

1094
01:19:57,300 --> 01:20:00,699
"I locked eyes with you, grandma."

1095
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:02,699
Gopi, sit properly.

1096
01:20:02,747 --> 01:20:04,497
Grandma, do it harder.

1097
01:20:04,579 --> 01:20:06,412
I am doing it.

1098
01:20:07,079 --> 01:20:09,287
Grandma, you have grown old.

1099
01:20:09,662 --> 01:20:10,746
Grandma!
- Yes!

1100
01:20:10,829 --> 01:20:13,997
This won't do! Move!
I will show you!

1101
01:20:14,079 --> 01:20:17,079
Here comes the wrestler!
Come, you too do it!

1102
01:20:18,747 --> 01:20:20,288
Sit properly!

1103
01:20:20,997 --> 01:20:23,997
Gauri, don't do it lovingly.
Hurry up.

1104
01:20:24,079 --> 01:20:25,162
I have so much work to do.

1105
01:20:25,247 --> 01:20:28,329
You are so big. How
can I do it quickly?

1106
01:20:28,412 --> 01:20:30,871
Do one thing. I will
do it half today.

1107
01:20:30,954 --> 01:20:32,037
And the rest some other day.

1108
01:20:32,122 --> 01:20:35,247
Look, pardon me. Bring water.
And pour it on me.

1109
01:20:35,497 --> 01:20:39,663
Gopi, shall I do it more?
- Okay!

1110
01:20:40,747 --> 01:20:44,704
"I locked eyes with you."

1111
01:20:46,204 --> 01:20:48,704
Grandma! Grandma!

1112
01:20:48,787 --> 01:20:49,871
Quickly get the water!

1113
01:20:50,412 --> 01:20:51,496
Sit!

1114
01:20:51,787 --> 01:20:53,829
Grandma! Quickly! Quickly!

1115
01:20:53,997 --> 01:20:55,079
Quiet!

1116
01:21:10,662 --> 01:21:11,746
Madam!

1117
01:21:13,247 --> 01:21:15,122
Look, the clothes which you gave me!

1118
01:21:16,412 --> 01:21:17,579
Don't I look good?

1119
01:21:19,412 --> 01:21:20,496
Yes!

1120
01:21:23,329 --> 01:21:25,747
Gopi, isn't it your birthday today?

1121
01:21:26,204 --> 01:21:27,912
What have you got for lunch?

1122
01:21:28,412 --> 01:21:29,579
Many things, madam! Wheat
pancake, sweets.

1123
01:21:29,662 --> 01:21:31,579
Gram flour round sweets. Sweetmeats.

1124
01:21:31,662 --> 01:21:34,246
Fried snacks. Round sweet.

1125
01:21:34,329 --> 01:21:37,204
Ladies finger.
And yes! Sweetened milk!

1126
01:21:37,287 --> 01:21:38,579
I have got sweetened milk too,
madam.

1127
01:21:38,662 --> 01:21:39,829
Is that so?
- Yes!

1128
01:21:39,912 --> 01:21:40,996
Let me see!

1129
01:21:41,079 --> 01:21:42,912
Madam, don't touch it!

1130
01:21:43,662 --> 01:21:46,496
Why? Won't you eat it if I touch it?

1131
01:21:47,579 --> 01:21:49,079
That is not so, madam.

1132
01:21:49,162 --> 01:21:51,329
The thing is that today
I was in a hurry.

1133
01:21:51,412 --> 01:21:53,579
On your birthday I will prepare
such delicious sweetened milk..

1134
01:21:53,662 --> 01:21:56,246
..that you will lick your fingers.

1135
01:22:45,704 --> 01:22:48,204
Madam! Madam! By mistake
you got my lunch box!

1136
01:22:48,287 --> 01:22:49,371
Here is your lunch box!

1137
01:22:49,662 --> 01:22:51,746
If I have made one mistake then
let me make another one.

1138
01:22:51,829 --> 01:22:52,997
Today I will eat your meals.

1139
01:22:53,079 --> 01:22:55,079
No, madam! You will eat this!

1140
01:22:56,162 --> 01:22:59,162
Why not? You eat this everyday.

1141
01:22:59,662 --> 01:23:01,204
Can't I eat it for a day?

1142
01:23:01,912 --> 01:23:04,579
It's different for me. This
food is not worthy for you.

1143
01:23:04,662 --> 01:23:05,746
Give it to me!

1144
01:23:05,829 --> 01:23:06,997
No, Gopi!
- Give!

1145
01:23:07,287 --> 01:23:10,246
Gopi! What if somebody saw?

1146
01:23:12,662 --> 01:23:14,454
But madam, you..
- Gopi, go!

1147
01:23:15,954 --> 01:23:19,204
Take this! I have cooked
this for you.

1148
01:23:19,662 --> 01:23:21,162
Today is your birthday.

1149
01:23:24,122 --> 01:23:25,204
Madam!

1150
01:23:27,162 --> 01:23:28,246
Go, Gopi!

1151
01:23:54,412 --> 01:23:58,246
Mr. Gopi! Mr. Gopi!

1152
01:24:00,079 --> 01:24:02,204
Yes, you! Isn't your name Gopi?

1153
01:24:02,287 --> 01:24:04,579
Yes. But how do you know?

1154
01:24:04,662 --> 01:24:06,954
Who doesn't know your name?

1155
01:24:07,372 --> 01:24:10,163
Have cigarette.
- No, sir. I don't smoke.

1156
01:24:10,247 --> 01:24:13,329
You should try it. Smoke it!

1157
01:24:18,872 --> 01:24:21,038
Will you do me a favour?
- What, sir?

1158
01:24:21,662 --> 01:24:22,746
Come here.

1159
01:24:24,162 --> 01:24:25,829
It's very bitter, sir!

1160
01:24:28,204 --> 01:24:29,497
Madam! Madam!

1161
01:24:30,872 --> 01:24:33,579
Look, what I got for you!
- Must be flower.

1162
01:24:33,662 --> 01:24:36,246
I gave you that in the morning.
- Then what is it?

1163
01:24:36,412 --> 01:24:38,454
Whatever it is, it's English.

1164
01:24:39,662 --> 01:24:41,579
English?
- Yes!

1165
01:24:41,662 --> 01:24:44,079
Here is English love letter.

1166
01:24:45,497 --> 01:24:48,163
Love letter?
- Yes! Love letter!

1167
01:24:49,329 --> 01:24:50,497
You wrote it?

1168
01:24:51,454 --> 01:24:53,579
Madam, you too! If I had known
how to read and write..

1169
01:24:53,662 --> 01:24:55,829
..then I would have written
many love letters for you.

1170
01:24:57,162 --> 01:25:00,037
Fool! Who gave this to you?

1171
01:25:00,662 --> 01:25:03,162
Madam, that sir in your college!

1172
01:25:03,247 --> 01:25:06,788
Fair and short! What did
he say his name is?

1173
01:25:06,872 --> 01:25:09,288
Madam, he had a long name!
- Mr. Ram!

1174
01:25:09,372 --> 01:25:12,788
Yes! Mr. Ram! Mr. Ram! He gave
this love letter for you!

1175
01:25:13,204 --> 01:25:15,079
Gopi, do you know what
love letter is?

1176
01:25:15,162 --> 01:25:17,829
Yes! Sir told me!
- What?

1177
01:25:17,912 --> 01:25:20,579
He said that you write love
letter to the person..

1178
01:25:20,662 --> 01:25:22,704
..whom you like the most!

1179
01:25:24,162 --> 01:25:27,204
Fool! Love letter means
letter of love!

1180
01:25:27,662 --> 01:25:28,746
Letter of love?

1181
01:25:29,329 --> 01:25:30,412
Letter means?

1182
01:25:31,372 --> 01:25:33,788
Meaning letter.
- Love meaning?

1183
01:25:33,997 --> 01:25:36,872
Love.
- So letter of love means?

1184
01:25:37,997 --> 01:25:42,204
Love letter. Letter of love.
What is this, madam?

1185
01:25:43,287 --> 01:25:44,371
Fool!

1186
01:25:44,662 --> 01:25:48,787
Fool! Fine, madam! Read
what is written in this.

1187
01:25:56,579 --> 01:25:57,662
What happened, madam?

1188
01:25:58,329 --> 01:26:00,662
Does a person write such a letter?

1189
01:26:00,747 --> 01:26:02,163
Is something bad written in this?

1190
01:26:02,247 --> 01:26:04,913
Bad? If my family found out,
then they will kill me!

1191
01:26:04,997 --> 01:26:07,413
O my God! Sir said something else!

1192
01:26:07,497 --> 01:26:10,122
He said it's a good thing
to do. It's nice to do it.

1193
01:26:10,204 --> 01:26:12,497
That's why he even
gave me 10 rupees.

1194
01:26:12,829 --> 01:26:17,704
And you took it? Listen!
Don't ever do this again!

1195
01:26:18,162 --> 01:26:19,454
I won't do it, madam.

1196
01:26:19,662 --> 01:26:20,996
Do you know what I would have done..

1197
01:26:21,079 --> 01:26:22,162
..had I been in your place?

1198
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:24,200
I would have slapped him!

1199
01:26:33,382 --> 01:26:34,000
O God!

1200
01:26:34,608 --> 01:26:37,692
God knows what they teach in
schools and colleges nowadays.

1201
01:26:38,024 --> 01:26:40,317
She can't even take
care of her books.

1202
01:26:45,983 --> 01:26:48,275
O my God! Listen!

1203
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:55,400
Listen! Listen! Where are you?

1204
01:26:55,817 --> 01:26:58,399
Look what she is doing under
the pretext of studying.

1205
01:26:58,649 --> 01:27:01,149
When I refused, nobody heeded me.

1206
01:27:01,233 --> 01:27:02,317
What happened?
- It has not yet happened.

1207
01:27:02,399 --> 01:27:03,482
Now it will happen.

1208
01:27:03,649 --> 01:27:05,274
People will laugh at us.
We will be slandered.

1209
01:27:05,442 --> 01:27:07,108
The entire village will insult us.
- Keep quiet!

1210
01:27:07,358 --> 01:27:08,733
You will make me quiet.

1211
01:27:08,899 --> 01:27:10,692
But how will you make people quiet?

1212
01:27:10,899 --> 01:27:12,692
Look, your dear daughter's doing!

1213
01:27:14,317 --> 01:27:15,817
Dear darling Radha.

1214
01:27:16,149 --> 01:27:22,317
I still remember those sweet
words. Your smile..

1215
01:27:22,483 --> 01:27:23,567
Where did you find this?

1216
01:27:23,733 --> 01:27:27,067
In your dear daughter's books.
Now you came to know.

1217
01:27:28,024 --> 01:27:30,817
What, sister? Tell me too.

1218
01:27:30,899 --> 01:27:33,817
His dear daughter has started
writing love letter.

1219
01:27:33,899 --> 01:27:36,442
Fine! Fine! Nothing to worry.

1220
01:27:36,692 --> 01:27:38,983
Her age is such. And
college's study.

1221
01:27:39,192 --> 01:27:40,649
Sister, you don't know.

1222
01:27:40,817 --> 01:27:42,983
College has become the meeting
ground of marriage.

1223
01:27:43,149 --> 01:27:44,232
Let me see.

1224
01:27:47,024 --> 01:27:51,149
Wow! Handwriting is nice.
And such sweet talks.

1225
01:27:51,317 --> 01:27:53,817
During our age we didn't
study such things.

1226
01:27:53,983 --> 01:27:58,025
Good! Very good! Student
is intelligent. Rajendra!

1227
01:27:58,317 --> 01:27:59,774
Don't get angry, brother-in-law.

1228
01:27:59,983 --> 01:28:02,233
This is the time to
be calm and patient.

1229
01:28:02,524 --> 01:28:04,942
If you will resort to scolding then
the outcome will be opposite.

1230
01:28:05,192 --> 01:28:06,567
Because this is the matter of love.

1231
01:28:06,733 --> 01:28:09,192
Leave it on me. I will
make everything fine.

1232
01:28:09,442 --> 01:28:12,399
An intelligent man like me can
solve this complex matter.

1233
01:28:12,774 --> 01:28:16,317
Yes, brother. Now the honour of
the family lies in your hand.

1234
01:28:16,483 --> 01:28:17,567
There is no doubt in this.

1235
01:28:27,233 --> 01:28:28,567
You go. I will come after sometime.

1236
01:28:32,692 --> 01:28:34,274
Mr. Gopi! Mr. Gopi!

1237
01:28:35,108 --> 01:28:36,942
Tell me! What answer did Radha give?

1238
01:28:37,274 --> 01:28:39,817
I will just give you the answer.
Just close your eyes.

1239
01:28:39,899 --> 01:28:42,399
Why are you harassing me? Here.

1240
01:28:46,774 --> 01:28:47,899
If you will again dare to do this..

1241
01:28:47,983 --> 01:28:49,317
..then I will break your bones.

1242
01:28:50,483 --> 01:28:51,608
Here is your money.

1243
01:28:55,983 --> 01:28:59,775
Hey, mister! Are you Ram?
- Yes. Why?

1244
01:28:59,942 --> 01:29:02,567
You had written love letter
to a girl. I am her uncle.

1245
01:29:02,733 --> 01:29:04,233
Uncle!
- Uncle, spare me!

1246
01:29:04,399 --> 01:29:06,649
I will never spare you!
You are calling me uncle!

1247
01:29:06,817 --> 01:29:09,649
Close your eyes. Remember
your parents. - Why?

1248
01:29:09,817 --> 01:29:11,399
Because I have come
to break your teeth.

1249
01:29:11,567 --> 01:29:14,233
Wait! First let me compose myself.

1250
01:29:14,399 --> 01:29:17,274
Shut up! Take your parents'
name! One, two..

1251
01:29:17,399 --> 01:29:18,567
Father's name Raja Vishwanath Rai.

1252
01:29:18,649 --> 01:29:19,732
Mother's name Rani Durgawati!

1253
01:29:19,899 --> 01:29:21,067
Take your father's name again.

1254
01:29:21,233 --> 01:29:22,400
Raja Vishwanath Rai.

1255
01:29:22,567 --> 01:29:24,983
O my God! So you are Mr. Rai's son.
- Yes.

1256
01:29:25,192 --> 01:29:28,067
And Raja Jagannath Rai.
- I am his younger brother.

1257
01:29:28,233 --> 01:29:31,192
Good! Embrace me! Embrace me! -
No, you will beat me!

1258
01:29:31,358 --> 01:29:34,400
Who will beat you? Can somebody
beat Rai family's son?

1259
01:29:34,733 --> 01:29:37,650
Tell me something. Your father
is dead, right? - Yes.

1260
01:29:37,817 --> 01:29:39,067
And mother too.
- Yes.

1261
01:29:39,233 --> 01:29:40,317
Good! Very good!

1262
01:29:40,483 --> 01:29:42,900
You both brothers are Rai's
wealth's inheritor.

1263
01:29:43,067 --> 01:29:44,692
Yes. We both are equal partners.

1264
01:29:44,899 --> 01:29:47,732
What will be the estimate
price of your share?

1265
01:29:47,899 --> 01:29:50,649
Around 20-25 lakhs.
- Good! Very good!

1266
01:29:51,317 --> 01:29:54,024
You love Radha a lot?

1267
01:29:54,192 --> 01:30:00,149
A lot? More than heaven and
earth. More than my life.

1268
01:30:00,317 --> 01:30:03,108
Nowadays life is not worth anything.

1269
01:30:03,274 --> 01:30:04,649
It's cheaper than peanuts.

1270
01:30:04,817 --> 01:30:07,567
Tell me. Do you love her
more than your wealth?

1271
01:30:07,817 --> 01:30:11,942
Wealth? In front of Radha this
wealth is worth nothing.

1272
01:30:12,192 --> 01:30:15,733
I mean can you give me a small
share of your wealth?

1273
01:30:15,899 --> 01:30:17,482
What? Look, Mr. Ram.

1274
01:30:17,649 --> 01:30:19,899
Those times are gone
when the lover used to..

1275
01:30:19,983 --> 01:30:22,817
..die for his beloved
and feel proud.

1276
01:30:22,899 --> 01:30:26,399
Nowadays everything is weighed
and its price is quoted.

1277
01:30:26,567 --> 01:30:28,649
If you want, I can fix this
marriage in a jiffy.

1278
01:30:28,817 --> 01:30:30,067
Can you really do this?

1279
01:30:30,233 --> 01:30:32,983
Is this something to ask? I told
you. I am the girl's uncle.

1280
01:30:33,149 --> 01:30:34,149
And the girl's father's
brother-in-law.

1281
01:30:34,317 --> 01:30:37,192
What you want, that will happen.
Good! Very good! - But wait!

1282
01:30:37,942 --> 01:30:40,067
You can touch my feet as
many times as you want.

1283
01:30:40,233 --> 01:30:42,150
But I will take the
money in advance.

1284
01:30:42,317 --> 01:30:45,399
Okay! Fine! But is the
matter fixed? - Yes!

1285
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Very good! Very good!

1286
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:50,750
I have killed two birds
with one stone.

1287
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
You can only kill birds,
brother-in-law.

1288
01:30:53,250 --> 01:30:54,542
You can't kill lion.

1289
01:30:54,707 --> 01:30:58,625
Brother-in-law, you always
underestimate me.

1290
01:30:58,792 --> 01:31:00,833
But today I will clear
your misunderstanding.

1291
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,417
I have found such a
nice groom for Radha.

1292
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:05,500
He belongs to Rai family.

1293
01:31:05,667 --> 01:31:08,500
What a boy! Tall, fair, handsome!

1294
01:31:08,667 --> 01:31:09,875
And he is studying B.A.

1295
01:31:10,707 --> 01:31:14,707
But they are so rich. How can
we fix alliance with them?

1296
01:31:14,875 --> 01:31:17,417
If we can't match their stature..

1297
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:19,082
..then we can lower their stature.

1298
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:21,832
But we should ask Radha too.

1299
01:31:23,207 --> 01:31:24,707
We should take her opinion too.

1300
01:31:25,792 --> 01:31:28,500
By the time you will
ask her opinion..

1301
01:31:28,582 --> 01:31:30,541
..she would have written
loads of love letter.

1302
01:31:30,707 --> 01:31:33,666
Then you can read
it in your old age.

1303
01:31:34,250 --> 01:31:37,056
You too talk so unromantically,
sister.

1304
01:31:37,300 --> 01:31:40,650
That boy had written the
love letter to Radha.

1305
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:44,289
That means Radha like him.

1306
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:46,730
..then what problems can we have?

1307
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:49,800
Ok, i will go
and fix the wedding.

1308
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,800
Madam, Madam.

1309
01:32:07,699 --> 01:32:10,699
Madam, you came very late today.

1310
01:32:10,750 --> 01:32:12,399
Yes, I got late in colllege.

1311
01:32:13,550 --> 01:32:17,012
You completly wet, let's
will leave once water comes down.

1312
01:32:17,399 --> 01:32:19,500
No,no i have to go home now
take me to other side.

1313
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:20,700
You are simply great.

1314
01:32:20,899 --> 01:32:23,649
The ganges(river-ganga) is on the upswing,
difficult to helm drive.

1315
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,899
Let the rain stop, then i take
you other side.

1316
01:32:25,979 --> 01:32:26,599
Come.

1317
01:32:27,199 --> 01:32:28,079
Come, come.

1318
01:32:30,699 --> 01:32:32,260
You will get drenched.

1319
01:32:32,310 --> 01:32:34,775
You don't worry about
me, madam. Come!

1320
01:32:40,817 --> 01:32:45,399
Here. Dry yourself. I will
get hot milk for you.

1321
01:32:45,858 --> 01:32:47,942
No! No need to get milk!

1322
01:32:48,608 --> 01:32:51,067
There is a need, madam. I know it.

1323
01:32:51,192 --> 01:32:53,733
Gopi, come back! Gopi!

1324
01:32:54,233 --> 01:32:55,692
I will just be back, madam.

1325
01:33:18,399 --> 01:33:20,149
Madam! Here!

1326
01:33:23,608 --> 01:33:26,000
You won't drink?
- I had it, madam.

1327
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:28,900
You are lying.
- Really. - Really.

1328
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:30,233
I swear, madam.

1329
01:33:36,699 --> 01:33:38,324
Here. Drink some more.

1330
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:40,200
No, madam.

1331
01:33:42,899 --> 01:33:44,282
It's not my leftover.

1332
01:33:45,341 --> 01:33:46,716
What are you saying, madam?

1333
01:33:55,091 --> 01:33:58,507
Gopi, you slapped him?

1334
01:33:59,757 --> 01:34:02,757
Him! Yes! That man!

1335
01:34:03,466 --> 01:34:08,216
Madam, I slapped him so hard
that he fell on the ground!

1336
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:12,842
Great! You did a great deed!
Is this a good thing to do?

1337
01:34:13,841 --> 01:34:17,257
What is right and what is wrong?
I don't know that.

1338
01:34:17,507 --> 01:34:19,132
You said it. And I did it.

1339
01:34:20,175 --> 01:34:23,592
You will do whatever I say?

1340
01:34:23,949 --> 01:34:26,757
Yes! If you will say, I
will jump in the fire.

1341
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:28,217
I will jump in river Ganga.

1342
01:34:29,507 --> 01:34:31,966
What are you saying?
- I am telling the truth, madam.

1343
01:34:35,216 --> 01:34:40,466
Tell me, Gopi. Why do
you like me so much?

1344
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:48,257
Madam.. just like that, madam.

1345
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:54,050
No. I think there was some
debt of previous lifetime..

1346
01:34:54,132 --> 01:34:56,175
..which you are repaying now.

1347
01:34:57,591 --> 01:34:58,757
What?

1348
01:35:09,699 --> 01:35:13,240
Who knows what relationship
is of which lifetime.

1349
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:38,092
"We both.."

1350
01:35:38,675 --> 01:35:40,967
"We both.."

1351
01:35:41,216 --> 01:35:51,341
"We both have been singing this
song of love since ages."

1352
01:35:51,708 --> 01:35:56,349
"We will sing it forever."

1353
01:35:56,425 --> 01:35:57,884
"We both.."

1354
01:35:58,841 --> 01:36:08,674
"We both have been life partners
in many lifetimes."

1355
01:36:08,841 --> 01:36:13,299
"We will remain forever."

1356
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:15,675
"We both.."

1357
01:36:25,100 --> 01:36:29,634
"Whenever we took a birth."

1358
01:36:30,050 --> 01:36:34,759
"Whenever this body adorned,
beloved."

1359
01:36:35,009 --> 01:36:39,675
"You always married me."

1360
01:36:40,091 --> 01:36:44,698
"You adorned me with bangles."

1361
01:36:44,850 --> 01:36:49,592
"Whether we were flowers or ashes."

1362
01:36:49,925 --> 01:36:54,592
"But we never parted."

1363
01:36:54,750 --> 01:37:04,925
"Every time you dwelled
in my eyes as dreams."

1364
01:37:10,100 --> 01:37:12,307
"We both.."

1365
01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:22,167
"We both have been singing this
song of love since ages."

1366
01:37:22,417 --> 01:37:27,000
"We will sing it forever."

1367
01:37:27,167 --> 01:37:29,167
"We both.."

1368
01:37:43,667 --> 01:37:48,334
"Today I call you mine."

1369
01:37:48,583 --> 01:37:53,250
"But we were never strangers."

1370
01:37:53,500 --> 01:38:02,917
"I embraced you for ages."

1371
01:38:03,083 --> 01:38:07,708
"People thought we had parted."

1372
01:38:07,958 --> 01:38:12,708
"Such times too had come."

1373
01:38:12,958 --> 01:38:22,583
"But what parted was our
souls and not us."

1374
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:38,083
"We both have been singing this
song of love since ages."

1375
01:38:38,250 --> 01:38:44,833
"We both have been singing.
We will sing it forever."

1376
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,583
"We both.."

1377
01:38:59,667 --> 01:39:00,917
Gopi!

1378
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:05,467
Madam! What happened? Madam!
What happened?

1379
01:39:05,800 --> 01:39:09,050
I am scared. It's lightening.

1380
01:39:09,675 --> 01:39:12,550
No, madam. Grandma says
it's not lightening.

1381
01:39:12,716 --> 01:39:14,341
But drums are beating
in God's abode.

1382
01:39:14,632 --> 01:39:15,716
Drums?
- Yes.

1383
01:39:16,841 --> 01:39:18,841
Maybe I am scared of drums too.

1384
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:25,067
Radha! Radha! You
are very fortunate!

1385
01:39:26,399 --> 01:39:27,399
I am fortunate.

1386
01:39:27,550 --> 01:39:29,692
Otherwise I wouldn't have
got a mother like you.

1387
01:39:30,300 --> 01:39:31,675
God bless you.

1388
01:39:31,882 --> 01:39:35,119
Today in the morning you were
asking where we are going.

1389
01:39:35,180 --> 01:39:36,467
Now I will tell you.

1390
01:39:36,550 --> 01:39:38,550
I will give you such good news..

1391
01:39:38,632 --> 01:39:42,175
..that now nobody will say
that I am your step-mother.

1392
01:39:42,199 --> 01:39:43,865
And that I became Kaikai.

1393
01:39:44,350 --> 01:39:45,400
But what's the matter, mother?

1394
01:39:45,500 --> 01:39:47,658
We have fixed your alliance.
- Alliance?

1395
01:39:47,824 --> 01:39:51,032
Yes! Your love letter, Mr. Ram.

1396
01:39:51,199 --> 01:39:52,782
We had gone to his house.

1397
01:39:53,490 --> 01:39:54,949
Mother!
- Radha!

1398
01:39:55,740 --> 01:39:59,649
That guy is so brilliant whom
you love. - But father..

1399
01:39:59,710 --> 01:40:05,658
No, no! No need to worry. And
Mr. Ram is not a stranger.

1400
01:40:06,449 --> 01:40:10,657
I have known his father
and his family very well.

1401
01:40:11,615 --> 01:40:15,600
And dear, when you both
love each other so much..

1402
01:40:16,250 --> 01:40:17,865
..then what problems can I have?

1403
01:40:18,033 --> 01:40:19,575
Father!
- Dear!

1404
01:40:20,699 --> 01:40:22,574
The date has been
fixed for Ekadashi (auspicious day).

1405
01:40:22,783 --> 01:40:24,500
And I have fixed everything.

1406
01:40:25,074 --> 01:40:28,657
I wish.. your mother had been alive.

1407
01:40:29,158 --> 01:40:30,550
She would have seen this joy.

1408
01:41:10,274 --> 01:41:11,357
Madam!

1409
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:19,850
Now how long will give you
give me flower, Gopi?

1410
01:41:19,949 --> 01:41:21,233
Why, madam?

1411
01:41:22,283 --> 01:41:23,700
I am going to get married.

1412
01:41:26,033 --> 01:41:28,783
Yes, madam. Even I heard it.

1413
01:41:30,300 --> 01:41:34,908
Isn't he that love letter guy?
He is a nice man, madam.

1414
01:41:35,615 --> 01:41:37,033
He is capable of you.

1415
01:41:58,033 --> 01:41:59,408
What are you thinking, Gopi?

1416
01:42:01,500 --> 01:42:07,449
I was wondering.. where
this river ends, madam.

1417
01:42:09,658 --> 01:42:14,575
Don't you know? All the rivers
merge with the sea.

1418
01:42:19,199 --> 01:42:23,115
I said it wrong, Gopi.
Not all the rivers.

1419
01:42:24,365 --> 01:42:28,283
There are a few which
end on the way.

1420
01:42:29,365 --> 01:42:34,783
They don't meet the sea. Still
they are called rivers.

1421
01:43:27,300 --> 01:43:29,283
'It's lightening.'

1422
01:43:29,615 --> 01:43:30,783
'It's not lightening.'

1423
01:43:30,949 --> 01:43:32,407
'But drums are beating
in God's abode.'

1424
01:43:32,865 --> 01:43:34,824
'Maybe I am scared of drums too.'

1425
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:01,450
Sir, now we will leave.

1426
01:44:01,949 --> 01:44:03,824
Gopi, how is that possible?

1427
01:44:04,449 --> 01:44:07,380
Mr. Ram, Gopi is a good singer.

1428
01:44:07,500 --> 01:44:10,324
Is that so? Then Gopi,
you will have to sing.

1429
01:44:11,574 --> 01:44:13,449
Sir, you too..

1430
01:44:13,574 --> 01:44:15,907
Don't feel shy. Sing! Gopi, sing!

1431
01:44:26,100 --> 01:44:29,182
"Congratulations to everybody."

1432
01:44:29,766 --> 01:44:33,016
"This ambience is lovely."

1433
01:44:34,057 --> 01:44:40,516
"I am happy. Ignore my tears."

1434
01:44:41,182 --> 01:44:46,766
"I am crazy, crazy, crazy."

1435
01:44:46,932 --> 01:44:52,850
"I am crazy, crazy, crazy."

1436
01:44:58,725 --> 01:45:01,517
"Congratulations to everybody."

1437
01:45:01,682 --> 01:45:04,391
"This ambience is lovely."

1438
01:45:04,557 --> 01:45:09,682
"I am happy. Ignore my tears."

1439
01:45:09,850 --> 01:45:15,350
"I am crazy, crazy, crazy."

1440
01:45:15,516 --> 01:45:21,599
"I am crazy, crazy, crazy."

1441
01:45:32,975 --> 01:45:38,682
"Tears are of many kinds."

1442
01:45:38,891 --> 01:45:44,391
"Tears are of many kinds."

1443
01:45:44,557 --> 01:45:50,100
"If there is sorrow in your
heart, then eyes cry."

1444
01:45:50,350 --> 01:45:55,267
"Even in happiness.."

1445
01:45:55,932 --> 01:46:01,600
"Even in happiness,
eyes shed tears."

1446
01:46:01,766 --> 01:46:07,516
"People can't understand it."

1447
01:46:07,682 --> 01:46:13,016
"I am happy. Ignore my tears."

1448
01:46:13,350 --> 01:46:18,600
"I am crazy, crazy, crazy."

1449
01:46:18,766 --> 01:46:24,599
"I am crazy, crazy, crazy."

1450
01:46:50,766 --> 01:46:56,766
"Clarions are giving blessings."

1451
01:46:57,016 --> 01:47:02,641
"Clarions are giving blessings."

1452
01:47:02,807 --> 01:47:08,475
"A kin has got estranged."

1453
01:47:08,725 --> 01:47:14,017
"She is going to unite
with somebody."

1454
01:47:14,641 --> 01:47:17,349
"She is going to unite
with somebody."

1455
01:47:17,516 --> 01:47:20,266
"She is going to part
with somebody."

1456
01:47:20,391 --> 01:47:26,099
"New relationships have
broken old ties."

1457
01:47:26,266 --> 01:47:31,641
"I am happy. Ignore my tears."

1458
01:47:31,807 --> 01:47:37,266
"I am crazy, crazy, crazy."

1459
01:47:37,350 --> 01:47:43,267
"I am crazy, crazy, crazy."

1460
01:48:01,225 --> 01:48:06,975
"The tide of the river
of time says this."

1461
01:48:07,141 --> 01:48:12,682
"The tide of the river
of time says this."

1462
01:48:12,850 --> 01:48:18,475
"Your maternal house and the boat."

1463
01:48:18,807 --> 01:48:24,266
"Damsel, when you are leaving.."

1464
01:48:24,516 --> 01:48:27,349
"Damsel, when you are leaving..

1465
01:48:27,432 --> 01:48:30,266
..then forget everything."

1466
01:48:30,350 --> 01:48:32,850
"Don't again remember us."

1467
01:48:33,100 --> 01:48:35,932
"And we won't remember you."

1468
01:48:36,100 --> 01:48:41,517
"I am happy. Ignore my tears."

1469
01:48:41,682 --> 01:48:47,266
"I am crazy, crazy, crazy."

1470
01:48:47,350 --> 01:48:52,850
"I am crazy, crazy, crazy."

1471
01:48:53,266 --> 01:48:56,099
"Congratulations to everybody."

1472
01:48:56,266 --> 01:48:58,849
"This ambience is lovely."

1473
01:48:59,016 --> 01:49:04,266
"I am happy. Ignore my tears."

1474
01:49:04,350 --> 01:49:09,767
"I am crazy, crazy, crazy."

1475
01:49:09,932 --> 01:49:16,016
"I am crazy, crazy, crazy."

1476
01:49:33,300 --> 01:49:33,850
Madam!

1477
01:50:43,024 --> 01:50:44,232
You won't leave me alone!

1478
01:50:44,399 --> 01:50:46,732
That's why I tell you,
Gopi, to marry me!

1479
01:50:46,899 --> 01:50:48,649
All your problems will be solved.

1480
01:50:49,067 --> 01:50:53,899
I will cook for you. I will look
after your children. And..

1481
01:50:55,817 --> 01:50:57,567
That's why I should marry you!

1482
01:50:57,733 --> 01:51:00,650
Why? Is this less?

1483
01:51:01,192 --> 01:51:03,567
You are not the only girl
who knows cooking!

1484
01:51:03,733 --> 01:51:04,817
There are other girls too!

1485
01:51:05,067 --> 01:51:08,067
You won't find a better
girl than me!

1486
01:51:08,149 --> 01:51:10,399
Get lost! Gopi! Gopi!

1487
01:51:11,274 --> 01:51:12,899
Tell me something.
- Yes.

1488
01:51:13,192 --> 01:51:15,442
Why you don't want to marry me?

1489
01:51:15,608 --> 01:51:17,817
Am I dark or crippled?

1490
01:51:18,149 --> 01:51:20,192
If you had been, then I
would have married you.

1491
01:51:20,442 --> 01:51:22,858
You mean I should become like this!

1492
01:51:23,024 --> 01:51:24,274
Yes! Quickly become like that!
Then I will think!

1493
01:51:24,442 --> 01:51:25,524
Gopi!

1494
01:51:25,733 --> 01:51:30,192
You are telling a pretty
girl to become crippled.

1495
01:51:30,358 --> 01:51:32,150
What did you say? Pretty girl?

1496
01:51:32,358 --> 01:51:35,483
Grandma, if you like her,
then you marry her.

1497
01:51:35,649 --> 01:51:37,732
Saw that, grandma!
What is he saying!

1498
01:51:37,899 --> 01:51:40,442
Dear, young people tend
to say such things.

1499
01:51:40,733 --> 01:51:43,483
In old age he will come to know.

1500
01:51:43,692 --> 01:51:48,524
Somebody should cook for you.
- Yes. And serve you. - Yes.

1501
01:51:49,358 --> 01:51:52,900
Grandma, are wives for this?

1502
01:51:53,149 --> 01:51:56,192
Don't you know that? What
else are wives for?

1503
01:51:56,858 --> 01:51:59,983
And every wife has to
look after her husband.

1504
01:52:00,192 --> 01:52:01,524
Then what!

1505
01:52:04,899 --> 01:52:06,524
So madam too must be doing it.

1506
01:52:07,608 --> 01:52:10,067
So what! Is madam any different?

1507
01:52:10,149 --> 01:52:11,692
Gauri, shut up!

1508
01:52:11,899 --> 01:52:17,442
Okay, Gopi! Poor madam must
be facing so many hurdles.

1509
01:52:18,442 --> 01:52:23,067
Gopi, along with madam why
didn't you too marry sir?

1510
01:52:23,149 --> 01:52:24,649
You would have done
the household chores.

1511
01:52:24,817 --> 01:52:26,483
If you talk too much
I will kill you!

1512
01:52:26,692 --> 01:52:29,524
Kill me! I have told
you so many times!

1513
01:52:29,899 --> 01:52:32,192
I will die in your arms only.

1514
01:52:32,608 --> 01:52:36,233
Now tell me. Will you marry
me or kill me? Get lost!

1515
01:52:36,817 --> 01:52:40,899
Gauri, you too nag him so much.

1516
01:52:41,149 --> 01:52:45,274
Can't you see his mood is bad?
Still you are going on talking!

1517
01:52:45,442 --> 01:52:48,942
What to do, grandma?
He doesn't marry me.

1518
01:52:49,192 --> 01:52:50,692
And he doesn't kill me.

1519
01:52:53,024 --> 01:52:55,899
Fine! There is enough
water in Ganga!

1520
01:52:56,067 --> 01:52:57,524
Today I will drown in it!

1521
01:52:58,774 --> 01:53:00,192
I am going!

1522
01:53:00,608 --> 01:53:03,192
Gauri, listen! Gauri!

1523
01:53:03,608 --> 01:53:05,150
Gopi!
- Yes!

1524
01:53:05,317 --> 01:53:07,858
She is really going
to drown! Stop her!

1525
01:53:08,149 --> 01:53:09,942
Let her go, grandma! Let her go!

1526
01:53:10,149 --> 01:53:13,317
Gauri! Wear stones and drown!

1527
01:53:13,608 --> 01:53:15,817
Otherwise you will again
come on the surface!

1528
01:53:21,274 --> 01:53:25,649
Gauri! Saw that, grandma!
What has she done!

1529
01:53:28,149 --> 01:53:30,732
Gauri! Gauri!

1530
01:53:31,274 --> 01:53:36,732
Listen! Where are you going?
- To drown in the river!

1531
01:53:37,149 --> 01:53:39,899
But the river is on this side!
Why are you going there?

1532
01:53:40,067 --> 01:53:41,149
Why do you want to know?

1533
01:53:41,317 --> 01:53:45,274
I don't care. But your admirer does
care. I don't have any admirer.

1534
01:53:45,442 --> 01:53:49,192
What are you saying, Gauri?
Gopi is there.

1535
01:53:50,608 --> 01:53:54,067
I am dead for him. Go and tell him.

1536
01:53:54,149 --> 01:53:56,067
Now we both don't have
any relationship.

1537
01:54:00,399 --> 01:54:02,149
And also tell him..
- Yes.

1538
01:54:02,317 --> 01:54:05,733
I am going to the jungle. I will
do penance day and night.

1539
01:54:05,983 --> 01:54:08,567
Still I won't come back.

1540
01:54:09,149 --> 01:54:13,024
I see! So the matter is so serious.

1541
01:54:56,358 --> 01:54:59,233
Leave me! Idiot!

1542
01:54:59,399 --> 01:55:00,482
Leave me!

1543
01:55:04,024 --> 01:55:07,899
Leave me! Leave me! Leave my hand!
How can I leave you? - Leave me!

1544
01:55:08,317 --> 01:55:11,192
You idiot! Leave me! Ruffian!

1545
01:55:21,067 --> 01:55:25,233
Is somebody there? Help! Help!
- Nobody will help you! - Help me!

1546
01:55:25,399 --> 01:55:28,649
Gopi, help! - Nobody will
help you! - Hey!

1547
01:56:20,192 --> 01:56:22,817
Wait! Just a minute! Just a minute!

1548
01:56:27,149 --> 01:56:28,317
One more minute!

1549
01:56:41,442 --> 01:56:43,649
Do you like me so much, Gopi?

1550
01:56:44,024 --> 01:56:45,567
I and like you?

1551
01:56:47,192 --> 01:56:50,149
Otherwise for me why would you
have thrashed him so badly?

1552
01:56:50,317 --> 01:56:52,192
Look, Gauri. I have beaten him.

1553
01:56:52,358 --> 01:56:54,567
Now it's your turn. If you
will talk nonsense then..

1554
01:56:54,733 --> 01:57:02,067
Get lost! You say all these things.
But you do love me.

1555
01:57:02,149 --> 01:57:04,149
Love?
- Yes. Look at your face.

1556
01:57:04,317 --> 01:57:08,399
I will give you a tight slap. And
you will forget all love. Come on!

1557
01:57:11,942 --> 01:57:15,067
No! No, Gauri! Gauri,
I am innocent. Gauri!

1558
01:57:15,399 --> 01:57:16,482
You!

1559
01:57:17,192 --> 01:57:18,692
You fool!

1560
01:57:21,608 --> 01:57:22,900
Rajjo! Rajjo!

1561
01:57:23,067 --> 01:57:25,567
So you gave up oaring boat and
you started this business.

1562
01:57:25,817 --> 01:57:27,899
No. Rajjo, listen to me.

1563
01:57:28,983 --> 01:57:33,567
Now I came to know where you
got 10 rupees everyday. Shameless!

1564
01:57:34,899 --> 01:57:37,982
If you came home, I will break
your leg. Okay! Okay!

1565
01:57:38,817 --> 01:57:44,149
I don't know what she eats.
She has broken my bones.

1566
01:57:44,317 --> 01:57:47,192
O my God! I was destined for her!

1567
01:57:48,983 --> 01:57:52,150
Break his hands and legs.
I don't care if he dies.

1568
01:57:52,442 --> 01:57:56,067
It's my responsibility.
Here. Go. - Come on.

1569
01:58:16,774 --> 01:58:20,067
O my God! O my God!

1570
01:58:32,067 --> 01:58:34,067
Gopi! Gopi!

1571
01:58:36,067 --> 01:58:39,317
Grandma! Come quickly, grandma!
Yes! Coming! - Come quickly!

1572
01:58:39,649 --> 01:58:42,067
O my God! Oh my God! Come here!
- What happened?

1573
01:58:42,149 --> 01:58:44,149
What happened to my child!
- Now what to do..

1574
01:58:44,233 --> 01:58:46,900
..grandma? Gopi! Gopi!

1575
01:58:56,983 --> 01:58:58,192
What's the matter, Radha?

1576
01:58:59,567 --> 01:59:03,399
Nothing. I had a bad dream.

1577
01:59:04,274 --> 01:59:06,149
Such an atrocity on a nice man.

1578
01:59:07,192 --> 01:59:11,649
These ruffians will rot!

1579
01:59:12,858 --> 01:59:15,525
Grandma, all this happened
because of me.

1580
01:59:16,274 --> 01:59:20,524
Those ruffians did this
to Gopi because of me.

1581
01:59:21,024 --> 01:59:23,649
Now what will happen, grandma?
Now what will happen?

1582
01:59:23,817 --> 01:59:27,317
Don't worry, dear. Gopi
will get well soon.

1583
01:59:33,692 --> 01:59:37,067
How many days are left
for Laxmi veneration?

1584
01:59:37,649 --> 01:59:39,317
Only 4 days.

1585
01:59:40,649 --> 01:59:41,817
4 days!

1586
01:59:45,442 --> 01:59:49,692
Will I be.. alive till then?

1587
01:59:50,067 --> 01:59:54,608
What are you saying! I have
not committed a sin!

1588
01:59:55,567 --> 01:59:57,733
That I will receive such
a grave punishment.

1589
01:59:58,649 --> 02:00:00,192
Sister! Sister!

1590
02:00:06,942 --> 02:00:09,233
What happened?
- Very bad news.

1591
02:00:09,774 --> 02:00:12,649
What happened?
- Son-in-law is no more.

1592
02:00:12,817 --> 02:00:13,942
O my God!

1593
02:00:14,317 --> 02:00:17,899
It's written in the telegram that
last night he had high fever.

1594
02:00:18,192 --> 02:00:20,942
And by morning he died.
- O my God!

1595
02:00:21,567 --> 02:00:22,733
Now what about poor Radha?

1596
02:00:23,649 --> 02:00:24,732
Listen!

1597
02:00:26,817 --> 02:00:29,524
Brother, he shouldn't
know about this.

1598
02:00:29,692 --> 02:00:32,817
You know. He has a weak heart.

1599
02:00:33,274 --> 02:00:37,192
God knows what he will go through
after hearing this news. Come here.

1600
02:00:41,149 --> 02:00:42,232
What happened?

1601
02:00:42,858 --> 02:00:45,567
You people were talking
about telegram.

1602
02:00:45,858 --> 02:00:47,192
From where did the telegram arrive?

1603
02:00:47,608 --> 02:00:51,025
We have received news
that Radha is not well.

1604
02:00:51,358 --> 02:00:53,817
Radha is not well! What happened?

1605
02:00:55,192 --> 02:01:01,192
Nothing! I mean she
is feeling nauseous.

1606
02:01:01,567 --> 02:01:02,942
She is feeling nauseous!

1607
02:01:04,233 --> 02:01:08,067
I understood! I will
become a grandpa.

1608
02:01:08,233 --> 02:01:10,067
I will become a grandpa. Right?

1609
02:01:10,149 --> 02:01:12,817
O my God! Why are you
getting up? Rest.

1610
02:01:12,983 --> 02:01:14,483
I will myself go to
bring my daughter.

1611
02:01:14,649 --> 02:01:15,732
What are you saying?

1612
02:01:15,899 --> 02:01:17,399
You will cover such a long
journey in this state?

1613
02:01:17,567 --> 02:01:18,649
First boat, then horse carriage,
then railway.

1614
02:01:18,733 --> 02:01:19,817
- And then again horse carriage.

1615
02:01:19,942 --> 02:01:22,192
And it's not our custom to
go to the daughter's house.

1616
02:01:22,358 --> 02:01:24,442
Why am there for? I will
go and bring Radha.

1617
02:01:24,608 --> 02:01:27,067
Okay. Bring her quickly.
- You rest.

1618
02:01:28,024 --> 02:01:31,024
Now I won't send her away.

1619
02:01:32,274 --> 02:01:34,607
Now they both will stay with me.

1620
02:01:35,774 --> 02:01:37,482
They will always stay with me.

1621
02:01:38,983 --> 02:01:40,817
What has happened, grandma?

1622
02:01:41,149 --> 02:01:42,482
What trouble is this?

1623
02:01:43,649 --> 02:01:45,899
Madam had not wronged anybody.

1624
02:01:46,692 --> 02:01:50,899
That God made her a widow.

1625
02:01:51,567 --> 02:01:55,899
Look, dear. Look. We all are
puppets in God's hands.

1626
02:01:56,192 --> 02:02:00,399
Creation and destruction
lies in His hands.

1627
02:02:02,233 --> 02:02:05,400
Grandma, Gopi shouldn't know this.

1628
02:02:06,233 --> 02:02:08,817
Just now he has got well.

1629
02:02:09,608 --> 02:02:13,067
If he heard it then God knows
what he will go through.

1630
02:02:13,192 --> 02:02:16,024
But dear, how long can we hide this?

1631
02:02:16,149 --> 02:02:19,899
Someday he will find out.
- Even I know this.

1632
02:02:20,524 --> 02:02:27,067
But we will have to hide this as
long as he doesn't get well, grandma.

1633
02:02:28,067 --> 02:02:31,192
What to say, dear? God's
play is divine.

1634
02:02:34,274 --> 02:02:37,192
Gopi, where are you going?
- To oar the boat.

1635
02:02:37,608 --> 02:02:41,067
Are you mad? You are
not completely well.

1636
02:02:41,274 --> 02:02:43,399
Are you so strong to oar the boat?

1637
02:02:43,567 --> 02:02:46,024
But you don't know. Tomorrow
is Laxmi veneration.

1638
02:02:46,149 --> 02:02:47,232
So what?

1639
02:02:47,399 --> 02:02:48,649
And today madam is going to arrive.

1640
02:02:48,817 --> 02:02:52,858
Gopi! Listen! First you get well!

1641
02:02:53,149 --> 02:02:55,567
Then you can go to meet her.
Now she will live here only.

1642
02:02:55,817 --> 02:02:56,899
I will surely go.

1643
02:02:57,067 --> 02:02:59,899
No! I won't let you
go in this state!

1644
02:03:00,067 --> 02:03:02,399
Gauri, I have not broken
my hands and feet!

1645
02:03:02,567 --> 02:03:05,274
And do you know? What madam
said when she left?

1646
02:03:06,149 --> 02:03:07,232
She said..

1647
02:03:07,983 --> 02:03:10,150
Gopi, if you won't come
with your boat..

1648
02:03:10,233 --> 02:03:14,025
..then will mother Ganga
let us cross the river?

1649
02:03:16,233 --> 02:03:18,650
Now you tell me. How
can I stay at home?

1650
02:03:18,983 --> 02:03:21,192
No matter what! I won't let
you go! I won't let you go!

1651
02:03:21,358 --> 02:03:23,067
Gauri, don't be mad! Leave me!

1652
02:03:39,233 --> 02:03:41,233
For whom are you taking this flower?

1653
02:03:41,567 --> 02:03:44,733
As if you don't know.
For madam. Who else?

1654
02:03:46,192 --> 02:03:48,399
What will madam do with the flower?

1655
02:03:48,983 --> 02:03:51,192
What do you mean?
- Nothing.

1656
02:03:51,608 --> 02:03:54,900
Who knows whether madam will
like this flower or not?

1657
02:03:54,949 --> 02:03:57,149
Why not? No matter how affluent
madam has become..

1658
02:03:57,233 --> 02:03:59,942
..but she likes this
flower the most.

1659
02:04:11,942 --> 02:04:13,983
Gauri! He left?

1660
02:04:15,067 --> 02:04:16,942
Now what will happen, grandma?

1661
02:04:18,442 --> 02:04:20,649
Dear, who can evade destiny?

1662
02:04:21,483 --> 02:04:24,733
God gives wounds and
He only heals it.

1663
02:04:54,149 --> 02:04:56,192
Madam!

1664
02:04:58,608 --> 02:05:01,525
No! Madam! No! No! No!

1665
02:05:06,983 --> 02:05:09,942
What has happened, madam?
What has happened?

1666
02:05:10,983 --> 02:05:15,942
You had left as a bride.
Adorned with vermilion..

1667
02:05:16,233 --> 02:05:20,025
And dot. And you have
returned in this form.

1668
02:05:20,608 --> 02:05:21,692
Gopi!

1669
02:05:22,649 --> 02:05:26,192
Was I alive to see this?
What injustice is this!

1670
02:05:26,358 --> 02:05:29,525
Whose curse is this? Where is God?

1671
02:05:29,942 --> 02:05:31,899
He is responsible for
our Goddess's state!

1672
02:05:34,274 --> 02:05:38,649
Why does God do such things
with good people like you?

1673
02:05:38,817 --> 02:05:41,067
Why? Why?

1674
02:05:41,317 --> 02:05:43,233
You think only you are
in grief. We are not.

1675
02:05:43,817 --> 02:05:44,942
Go and get the boat ready.

1676
02:05:45,483 --> 02:05:49,817
No, sir! Sir, I can't do this!
I can't do this, sir!

1677
02:05:50,983 --> 02:05:53,275
The boat in which madam
went as a bride.

1678
02:05:54,067 --> 02:05:56,192
Now she will go as a widow.

1679
02:05:56,817 --> 02:05:59,608
Won't Mother Ganga be in anguish?

1680
02:06:01,149 --> 02:06:02,232
Jaggu!

1681
02:06:06,774 --> 02:06:08,232
Madam!

1682
02:06:10,899 --> 02:06:11,982
Come, Radha.

1683
02:07:04,483 --> 02:07:08,275
Radha! O my God!

1684
02:07:09,233 --> 02:07:10,358
What has happened!

1685
02:07:10,774 --> 02:07:12,067
Radha!

1686
02:07:14,149 --> 02:07:15,232
Father!

1687
02:07:15,567 --> 02:07:17,692
No, Radha. Don't go there.

1688
02:07:18,067 --> 02:07:20,524
Last night he got a heart attack.

1689
02:07:21,149 --> 02:07:23,524
Doctor said his condition
is critical.

1690
02:07:23,774 --> 02:07:24,942
Radha!

1691
02:07:27,399 --> 02:07:28,649
Father!
- No, no!

1692
02:07:29,692 --> 02:07:34,233
If he saw you in this state then he
won't be able to tolerate it, Radha!

1693
02:07:35,233 --> 02:07:38,317
I beg for my husband's life!
- Mother!

1694
02:07:45,983 --> 02:07:48,567
Radha! Radha!

1695
02:07:48,858 --> 02:07:50,817
Since when I am calling.
Nobody is answering me!

1696
02:07:50,983 --> 02:07:54,525
Brother-in-law, listen! Radha
has come. Where is she?

1697
02:07:54,942 --> 02:07:57,899
You rest inside. She
will be here soon.

1698
02:07:58,067 --> 02:08:01,817
I am resting since a long time.
First, let me meet Radha!

1699
02:08:02,067 --> 02:08:05,942
I won't die. Radha!

1700
02:08:06,608 --> 02:08:08,525
Listen!
- Radha! Let it be, sister.

1701
02:08:08,774 --> 02:08:10,774
Now we can't stop brother-in-law.

1702
02:08:10,942 --> 02:08:12,192
What is to happen, it will happen.

1703
02:08:41,274 --> 02:08:44,067
Radha! Are you angry with me?

1704
02:08:44,524 --> 02:08:46,857
Because I didn't call
you here sooner.

1705
02:08:48,858 --> 02:08:52,275
Dear, now I won't send you back.

1706
02:08:52,817 --> 02:08:54,399
Now I will keep you near me.

1707
02:08:54,774 --> 02:08:56,192
You will stay with me, won't you?

1708
02:08:56,608 --> 02:09:00,067
And listen, I will
call Ram here too.

1709
02:09:03,149 --> 02:09:05,399
Radha!
- Father!

1710
02:09:05,608 --> 02:09:08,900
O my God! O my God! Father!
- Is somebody there?

1711
02:09:09,149 --> 02:09:10,982
Brother! Come soon!

1712
02:09:35,567 --> 02:09:36,817
Doctor!

1713
02:09:37,358 --> 02:09:42,400
Don't worry. He will be fine
by morning. - But.. - But what?

1714
02:09:42,858 --> 02:09:47,025
He has received a shock. So he
has lost his power of speech.

1715
02:09:47,233 --> 02:09:48,400
O my God!

1716
02:09:49,233 --> 02:09:51,775
So my father will never
be able to talk?

1717
02:09:51,983 --> 02:09:53,525
Nothing can be said now.

1718
02:09:53,983 --> 02:09:57,358
Let him get better. I will
examine him once more.

1719
02:09:57,983 --> 02:09:59,358
Now I will leave.

1720
02:10:01,442 --> 02:10:03,067
O my God! Now what will happen?

1721
02:10:03,149 --> 02:10:05,399
Don't worry, sister. Let's
wait for a day or two.

1722
02:10:05,567 --> 02:10:07,233
If he doesn't get well then
I will call the famous doctors..

1723
02:10:07,317 --> 02:10:09,233
..from the city. Okay?

1724
02:10:12,817 --> 02:10:13,942
Gopi!

1725
02:10:19,649 --> 02:10:23,192
Gopi! Gopi, what madness is this!

1726
02:10:23,567 --> 02:10:27,899
Why have you given up eating?
Eat! Come on!

1727
02:10:28,067 --> 02:10:31,899
Grandma.. madam is like a Goddess.
- Yes.

1728
02:10:32,692 --> 02:10:34,649
Why did this injustice
happen with her?

1729
02:10:35,942 --> 02:10:40,567
She got married just 2 months
ago. And she.. she..

1730
02:10:41,233 --> 02:10:44,900
Nobody is eternal in this world.

1731
02:10:45,149 --> 02:10:46,817
Someday everybody has to die.

1732
02:10:47,067 --> 02:10:50,524
But grandma, why didn't I die?
Why didn't you die?

1733
02:10:51,067 --> 02:10:53,358
In this whole world only madam's
husband had to die!

1734
02:10:53,524 --> 02:10:55,192
Nobody else! Nobody else!

1735
02:10:56,317 --> 02:10:59,774
Dear, look here. Look here.

1736
02:11:01,149 --> 02:11:04,192
Listen to me. Do you know?

1737
02:11:04,358 --> 02:11:07,400
What's the secret of life and death?

1738
02:11:08,442 --> 02:11:12,483
There is nothing called death.

1739
02:11:13,608 --> 02:11:18,608
This body is what dies and perishes.

1740
02:11:19,149 --> 02:11:24,942
Soul doesn't die. It's eternal.
It's undying.

1741
02:11:35,274 --> 02:11:37,149
Food has been kept here
since a long time.

1742
02:11:37,233 --> 02:11:38,733
You have still not eaten.

1743
02:11:39,067 --> 02:11:41,733
How long can somebody stay hungry?

1744
02:11:43,233 --> 02:11:44,733
You are not eating.

1745
02:11:44,983 --> 02:11:47,733
And your father's condition
is deteriorating day by day.

1746
02:11:48,024 --> 02:11:51,817
I am afraid my husband might die
because of your obstinacy.

1747
02:11:57,649 --> 02:11:59,399
God knows what will happen!

1748
02:12:46,192 --> 02:12:49,649
Madam! You are so educated!
Still you are doing this!

1749
02:12:50,983 --> 02:12:53,275
Listen! Will you eat?

1750
02:12:53,442 --> 02:12:55,817
Or will you make all of us starve
because of your daughter?

1751
02:12:56,567 --> 02:12:58,442
God knows what will happen
to this family!

1752
02:13:19,774 --> 02:13:20,857
Madam!

1753
02:13:25,100 --> 02:13:28,025
Shall I tell you something?

1754
02:13:32,942 --> 02:13:38,067
I am an illiterate.
Still listen to me.

1755
02:13:38,774 --> 02:13:41,942
I know everything, madam!
I know everything.

1756
02:13:44,399 --> 02:13:46,982
Yes, madam. Do you know?

1757
02:13:47,317 --> 02:13:48,817
What is the secret
of life and death?

1758
02:13:49,817 --> 02:13:53,067
There is nothing called death.

1759
02:13:53,524 --> 02:13:58,692
This body is what dies and perishes.

1760
02:13:59,108 --> 02:14:03,942
Soul doesn't die. It's eternal.
It's undying.

1761
02:14:04,817 --> 02:14:08,442
That's why it's called Ram.
It's the truth.

1762
02:14:11,733 --> 02:14:12,817
Right, madam?

1763
02:14:14,317 --> 02:14:18,399
Yes, Gopi. You are right.

1764
02:14:19,442 --> 02:14:22,274
So eat food.
- No, Gopi.

1765
02:14:23,524 --> 02:14:24,607
Have some fruits.

1766
02:14:25,983 --> 02:14:29,817
Look, if you won't eat then
I too will starve and die!

1767
02:14:32,800 --> 02:14:33,608
Gopi!

1768
02:14:53,774 --> 02:14:56,942
Thank you, madam! Thank you!

1769
02:15:33,942 --> 02:15:35,483
Now you go and rest.

1770
02:15:38,442 --> 02:15:44,649
Now I can't rest, Gopi.
I can't sleep.

1771
02:15:45,567 --> 02:15:46,774
This is what happens, madam.

1772
02:15:46,942 --> 02:15:49,399
When you had left, I too
had lost my slumber.

1773
02:16:18,483 --> 02:16:22,400
Gopi.. sing a song.
- Song?

1774
02:16:28,899 --> 02:16:34,816
"God willing."

1775
02:16:43,649 --> 02:16:48,941
"Let this happen by God's wish."

1776
02:16:49,566 --> 02:16:53,941
"You get my slumber."

1777
02:16:54,108 --> 02:16:59,899
"I stay awake. And you go to sleep."

1778
02:17:00,066 --> 02:17:06,274
"I stay awake. And you go to sleep."

1779
02:17:09,649 --> 02:17:14,649
"Let this happen by God's wish."

1780
02:17:15,149 --> 02:17:19,649
"You get my slumber."

1781
02:17:19,816 --> 02:17:25,399
"I stay awake. And you go to sleep."

1782
02:17:25,566 --> 02:17:31,816
"I stay awake. And you go to sleep."

1783
02:17:54,316 --> 02:17:59,774
"Your morose twilights
pass happily."

1784
02:17:59,941 --> 02:18:05,399
"I will exchange my
sleep with yours."

1785
02:18:05,733 --> 02:18:11,233
"Your morose twilights
pass happily."

1786
02:18:11,399 --> 02:18:16,483
"I will exchange my
sleep with yours."

1787
02:18:16,899 --> 02:18:22,149
"If it's in our hand."

1788
02:18:23,149 --> 02:18:28,316
"I will pray with my hands lifted."

1789
02:18:28,899 --> 02:18:33,316
"You get my slumber."

1790
02:18:33,483 --> 02:18:38,899
"I stay awake. And you go to sleep."

1791
02:18:39,066 --> 02:18:45,649
"I stay awake. And you go to sleep."

1792
02:19:02,608 --> 02:19:05,233
"Not just you and me."

1793
02:19:05,816 --> 02:19:13,316
"But everybody has to
experience pain."

1794
02:19:13,941 --> 02:19:17,232
"Not just you and me."

1795
02:19:17,399 --> 02:19:24,733
"But everybody has to
experience pain."

1796
02:19:25,358 --> 02:19:30,733
"A man goes mad."

1797
02:19:31,649 --> 02:19:36,941
"You always remember
and never forget."

1798
02:19:37,483 --> 02:19:41,817
"You get my slumber."

1799
02:19:41,899 --> 02:19:49,483
"I stay awake. And you go to sleep."

1800
02:19:49,649 --> 02:19:54,399
"I stay awake. And you go to sleep."

1801
02:20:16,733 --> 02:20:22,149
"Somebody covertly comes in dreams."

1802
02:20:22,316 --> 02:20:27,399
"And capricious wind
sings a lullaby."

1803
02:20:27,816 --> 02:20:33,566
"Somebody covertly comes in dreams."

1804
02:20:33,649 --> 02:20:38,566
"And capricious wind
sings a lullaby."

1805
02:20:39,316 --> 02:20:44,399
"The moonlight as a rope."

1806
02:20:45,608 --> 02:20:50,692
"Cradles your heart."

1807
02:20:51,191 --> 02:20:55,649
"You get my slumber."

1808
02:20:55,816 --> 02:21:01,399
"I stay awake. And you go to sleep."

1809
02:21:01,566 --> 02:21:07,982
"I stay awake. And you go to sleep."

1810
02:21:11,066 --> 02:21:16,232
"God wills this happen."

1811
02:21:16,899 --> 02:21:21,108
"You get my slumber."

1812
02:21:21,274 --> 02:21:26,941
"I stay awake. And you go to sleep."

1813
02:21:27,108 --> 02:21:32,483
"I stay awake. And you go to sleep."

1814
02:21:32,649 --> 02:21:34,941
"I stay awake."

1815
02:21:38,191 --> 02:21:40,816
"I stay awake."

1816
02:22:03,899 --> 02:22:07,233
Gauri! What are you doing
sitting here alone?

1817
02:22:08,066 --> 02:22:09,399
When are you getting married?

1818
02:22:10,399 --> 02:22:11,566
What does your Gopi say?

1819
02:22:12,233 --> 02:22:13,649
My Gopi?
- Yes!

1820
02:22:14,274 --> 02:22:17,649
Madam has become a widow.
So he too has become one.

1821
02:22:17,816 --> 02:22:19,899
He says I will never get married.

1822
02:22:20,066 --> 02:22:21,566
He spoke the truth.

1823
02:22:21,733 --> 02:22:25,649
When madam is here then why
does he need to marry?

1824
02:22:25,816 --> 02:22:28,066
I already knew this.
- What?

1825
02:22:28,983 --> 02:22:31,399
Shall I tell you?
- Yes. So listen!

1826
02:22:34,399 --> 02:22:36,149
Quiet! What nonsense!

1827
02:22:36,316 --> 02:22:39,899
If you don't believe me
then call madam a widow..

1828
02:22:39,983 --> 02:22:41,942
..in front of Gopi.

1829
02:22:42,191 --> 02:22:43,691
Then see what happens.

1830
02:22:44,108 --> 02:22:48,774
I am asking, if madam is not a
widow then who is her husband?

1831
02:22:49,691 --> 02:22:53,566
You think about it. You will
understand everything. Yes.

1832
02:23:08,566 --> 02:23:12,066
Gopi! Gopi! Today the decision
has to be taken!

1833
02:23:12,649 --> 02:23:15,191
What decision?
- Decision of our marriage!

1834
02:23:15,774 --> 02:23:18,941
Gauri! During such a time you
are thinking of such things!

1835
02:23:19,274 --> 02:23:20,566
What's wrong with the time?

1836
02:23:20,899 --> 02:23:22,941
Don't you see what madam
has gone through?

1837
02:23:23,899 --> 02:23:26,709
So because of that nobody in
the village will get married?

1838
02:23:26,799 --> 02:23:29,149
If he is sensible then
he won't marry.

1839
02:23:29,316 --> 02:23:32,439
It means you too won't marry.
- No! Never!

1840
02:23:32,549 --> 02:23:35,483
Madam has become a widow..
- Gauri! So why do you care?

1841
02:23:35,983 --> 02:23:38,774
You talk like this about
madam! Go to hell!

1842
02:23:45,274 --> 02:23:49,899
Yes! Fine! You don't become
a widow if your husband dies!

1843
02:23:50,149 --> 02:23:53,066
A woman becomes a widow
without getting married!

1844
02:23:53,524 --> 02:23:55,608
And I am that widow!

1845
02:23:56,842 --> 02:23:58,507
Sister!
- Coming!

1846
02:23:58,674 --> 02:24:02,716
What will you do? It's terrible!
We are ruined! What happened?

1847
02:24:02,799 --> 02:24:05,399
We are ruined! Our plan is thwarted!

1848
02:24:05,500 --> 02:24:08,632
Tell me. What happened?
- Ask what didn't happen!

1849
02:24:09,007 --> 02:24:12,382
In reply to our notice they have
send their lawyer's notice.

1850
02:24:12,549 --> 02:24:15,466
They have written that your
daughter is characterless.

1851
02:24:15,632 --> 02:24:17,967
Before marriage her character
was not good.

1852
02:24:18,132 --> 02:24:19,924
O my God! What are you saying?

1853
02:24:20,092 --> 02:24:24,050
Why are you wailing? Hear what
they have written! What?

1854
02:24:24,217 --> 02:24:25,800
They have written that
your daughter..

1855
02:24:25,882 --> 02:24:28,217
..has a relationship with
a boatman in the village.

1856
02:24:28,382 --> 02:24:30,799
And they even have the evidence.

1857
02:24:30,967 --> 02:24:32,882
On that basis they won't give
Radha any money..

1858
02:24:32,967 --> 02:24:34,882
..or share in the property.

1859
02:24:35,049 --> 02:24:37,716
And you kept quiet? Why
didn't you rebuke them?

1860
02:24:37,799 --> 02:24:39,699
They have falsely accused her.

1861
02:24:39,899 --> 02:24:43,174
Not a false accusation,
it's a true accusation.

1862
02:24:43,674 --> 02:24:47,841
Sister, when our kin is at fault
then why to blame others?

1863
02:24:48,174 --> 02:24:50,549
Why to go far away? Hear
in your own village.

1864
02:24:50,717 --> 02:24:53,300
What people talk about
Gopi and Radha.

1865
02:24:53,549 --> 02:24:57,466
I had refused. But nobody heeds me.

1866
02:24:57,717 --> 02:25:00,382
If I say something then people
say I am a step-mother.

1867
02:25:00,549 --> 02:25:02,216
She has become Kaikai.

1868
02:25:02,507 --> 02:25:05,882
He used to teach her singing.
This is what he taught!

1869
02:25:06,217 --> 02:25:10,842
Sister, we were going to get
lakhs. But we lost it.

1870
02:25:11,007 --> 02:25:12,299
To hell with the wealth!

1871
02:25:12,549 --> 02:25:14,799
What about our family's humiliation?

1872
02:25:14,967 --> 02:25:18,717
To hell with that! We have
incurred such a big loss!

1873
02:25:18,799 --> 02:25:21,841
How many lakhs we have lost!
What a loss! What a loss!

1874
02:25:22,132 --> 02:25:27,342
Greetings, madam! Is madam there?
So you have come!

1875
02:25:27,549 --> 02:25:29,549
I was wondering why you
have still not come.

1876
02:25:29,799 --> 02:25:33,132
I got late.
- No, you are not late.

1877
02:25:33,342 --> 02:25:35,842
Whatever you had to do, you
did it at the right time.

1878
02:25:35,950 --> 02:25:40,717
You have ruined my family!
- Madam, what are you saying?

1879
02:25:41,424 --> 02:25:43,882
Sister, why are you arguing
with this loafer?

1880
02:25:44,092 --> 02:25:45,632
I will throw him out.

1881
02:25:45,799 --> 02:25:48,716
Sir!
- Get lost! Get out!

1882
02:25:50,632 --> 02:25:52,674
Gopi! Gopi!

1883
02:25:54,592 --> 02:25:56,967
Radha! Where are you going?
- Let go of my hand!

1884
02:25:57,132 --> 02:26:00,049
Now do you want to elope with him?
- Uncle!

1885
02:26:00,674 --> 02:26:02,132
Why are you getting angry with me?

1886
02:26:02,507 --> 02:26:06,049
Go and hear what people are
talking about you and Gopi!

1887
02:26:06,549 --> 02:26:09,750
And that Gauri who doesn't
have any stature..

1888
02:26:09,799 --> 02:26:11,882
..she is slandering
the entire family!

1889
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:18,842
Mother!
- I am dead!

1890
02:26:19,092 --> 02:26:22,967
And your father too will hang
himself if he found out this.

1891
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:37,592
Gauri!

1892
02:26:42,467 --> 02:26:44,882
What have you done!
- Gopi!

1893
02:26:45,507 --> 02:26:47,799
What rumour have you spread
in the village!

1894
02:26:48,592 --> 02:26:52,632
Tell me! Why did you do this?
I will kill you!

1895
02:26:54,350 --> 02:26:57,050
Gopi! Gopi!

1896
02:27:00,049 --> 02:27:03,549
It's futile to kill you.
You are a sinner.

1897
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:08,299
You accused Goddess like madam.

1898
02:27:08,649 --> 02:27:12,882
You abused her. And
nobody else but you!

1899
02:27:13,174 --> 02:27:14,716
You should be buried alive!

1900
02:27:18,549 --> 02:27:20,799
Nothing good is left in this world.

1901
02:27:21,799 --> 02:27:25,257
Lie! Show off! Deceit everywhere!

1902
02:27:27,299 --> 02:27:31,841
Here for your selfish reason people
accuse God and Goddess.

1903
02:27:32,632 --> 02:27:38,842
What's the use of living in such
a world amidst such people?

1904
02:27:41,299 --> 02:27:42,466
What's the use?

1905
02:27:44,882 --> 02:27:46,507
Gopi! Gopi!

1906
02:27:46,799 --> 02:27:50,716
Don't go, Gopi! Don't go! No!
No! I won't let you go!

1907
02:27:50,799 --> 02:27:53,216
Gopi! Stop, Gopi!

1908
02:27:53,424 --> 02:27:56,549
Grandma! Stop Gopi, grandma!
He is leaving!

1909
02:27:56,842 --> 02:27:58,882
Grandma! Stop Gopi!

1910
02:27:59,092 --> 02:28:00,842
Now nobody can stop him.

1911
02:28:01,717 --> 02:28:03,300
The fire which you have started..

1912
02:28:03,700 --> 02:28:07,400
..you will perish in it
but along with you..

1913
02:28:07,700 --> 02:28:10,550
..those two innocent people
too will perish.

1914
02:28:10,717 --> 02:28:12,842
Shameless! You are not a woman!

1915
02:28:13,007 --> 02:28:14,717
You are a stigma on womanhood!

1916
02:28:15,049 --> 02:28:20,000
Go and die! Go and die!

1917
02:28:28,799 --> 02:28:33,949
Madam! Stop Gopi, madam! Stop him!

1918
02:28:34,290 --> 02:28:35,200
What happened to Gopi?

1919
02:28:36,100 --> 02:28:38,300
He is going forever!
- What!

1920
02:28:38,799 --> 02:28:41,899
Yes, madam. He has decided to die.

1921
02:28:43,299 --> 02:28:49,250
Madam, stop him. I beg you. For
God's sake, come quickly, madam.

1922
02:28:49,549 --> 02:28:50,399
Come quickly!

1923
02:28:52,850 --> 02:28:56,399
I am the sinner who
has set this fire.

1924
02:28:57,100 --> 02:29:02,450
I was mad. In my jealously
I did this.

1925
02:29:03,500 --> 02:29:04,833
Forgive me..

1926
02:29:07,299 --> 02:29:09,125
You!
- Yes! It's me!

1927
02:29:09,500 --> 02:29:11,750
That day Gopi saved you!

1928
02:29:12,125 --> 02:29:14,666
Today let me see who saves you!

1929
02:29:16,450 --> 02:29:20,150
Idiot! Ruffian! You
were beaten so badly.

1930
02:29:20,291 --> 02:29:21,957
Still you have not come
to your senses.

1931
02:29:22,125 --> 02:29:25,166
Now that you have come,
I will come to my senses.

1932
02:29:26,850 --> 02:29:29,041
Open the door! Open the door!

1933
02:30:29,899 --> 02:30:31,750
Brother! Brother!

1934
02:30:32,549 --> 02:30:33,250
Brother!

1935
02:30:34,350 --> 02:30:37,541
O my God! Blood and
gun in your hand!

1936
02:30:37,708 --> 02:30:38,792
What has happened to you?

1937
02:30:38,958 --> 02:30:42,417
Radha has eloped with Gopi!

1938
02:30:42,583 --> 02:30:45,542
But what noises were
coming from the room?

1939
02:30:45,708 --> 02:30:48,458
This.. I tried to stop them.
This is the result.

1940
02:30:48,625 --> 02:30:50,708
O my God! What trouble is this!

1941
02:30:50,875 --> 02:30:52,299
What has happened to Radha?

1942
02:30:52,450 --> 02:30:53,875
You don't worry, sister.

1943
02:30:54,041 --> 02:30:56,291
I am the protector of the
honour of this family.

1944
02:30:56,750 --> 02:30:59,291
I will kill that boatman. And
I will bring Radha back.

1945
02:30:59,375 --> 02:31:03,916
No, brother! Don't go!
- Move! For God's sake stop! Listen!

1946
02:31:04,291 --> 02:31:07,207
Did you hear? Radha
has eloped with Gopi!

1947
02:31:07,458 --> 02:31:09,625
She eloped with the boatman!

1948
02:31:14,389 --> 02:31:17,416
You are punishing me for
your daughter's deeds!

1949
02:31:32,049 --> 02:31:32,666
Gopi!

1950
02:31:35,375 --> 02:31:37,041
Gopi!
- Madam!

1951
02:31:58,833 --> 02:32:00,583
'Flowers will wither.'

1952
02:32:01,041 --> 02:32:05,375
'But the thread which binds
it together will not perish.'

1953
02:32:06,375 --> 02:32:13,083
"Whether we were flowers or ashes."

1954
02:32:13,600 --> 02:32:19,750
"But we never parted."

1955
02:32:20,100 --> 02:32:25,500
"Every time you dwelled..

1956
02:32:25,500 --> 02:32:31,791
..in my eyes as dreams."

1957
02:32:32,791 --> 02:32:33,957
Gopi!

1958
02:32:37,375 --> 02:32:38,500
Madam!

1959
02:32:38,875 --> 02:32:40,791
Gopi! Gopi!

1960
02:32:41,166 --> 02:32:42,291
Why did you come here, madam?

1961
02:32:42,375 --> 02:32:45,125
Why did you come here, Gopi? To die!

1962
02:32:46,450 --> 02:32:48,375
By killing yourself whom do you
want to take revenge from?

1963
02:32:48,458 --> 02:32:49,917
Yourself!

1964
02:32:51,125 --> 02:32:54,958
Gopi! You had explained such
a big secret of life.

1965
02:32:55,791 --> 02:32:57,707
You gave me the lesson of life.

1966
02:32:58,375 --> 02:33:01,666
And today.. you want to
run away from life.

1967
02:33:02,125 --> 02:33:04,291
Come! Let's go back!

1968
02:33:04,875 --> 02:33:08,125
No, madam. Now I won't go back.

1969
02:33:09,291 --> 02:33:12,416
What about me? What has to
happen, it will happen.

1970
02:33:13,083 --> 02:33:15,792
But.. you go back, madam.

1971
02:33:17,750 --> 02:33:21,875
If somebody saw they will
think it was true.

1972
02:33:23,666 --> 02:33:24,832
Let it be true.

1973
02:33:25,958 --> 02:33:28,458
By deceiving yourself
and leading a lie..

1974
02:33:28,458 --> 02:33:32,458
..its better to die.

1975
02:33:33,389 --> 02:33:37,875
By accepting the truth of heart.

1976
02:33:38,458 --> 02:33:39,583
What's the matter, sir?

1977
02:33:39,666 --> 02:33:41,666
Where are you going so late in the
night with a gun?

1978
02:33:42,125 --> 02:33:45,458
What is not done in daytime, that
is being done in the night.

1979
02:33:45,541 --> 02:33:46,600
Everybody's honour, this village's..

1980
02:33:46,700 --> 02:33:48,875
..respect will be tarnished.
- How so, sir?

1981
02:33:49,125 --> 02:33:50,375
Gopi, the boatman is eloping with..

1982
02:33:50,458 --> 02:33:52,458
..landlord's daughter Radha.

1983
02:33:52,541 --> 02:33:53,625
Gopi, the boatman is
eloping with Radha!

1984
02:33:53,708 --> 02:33:54,792
We won't let this happen!

1985
02:33:54,875 --> 02:33:55,958
Then come with me!

1986
02:33:56,041 --> 02:33:59,082
Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on!

1987
02:33:59,166 --> 02:34:01,875
Look, madam. Everybody
is coming here.

1988
02:34:02,458 --> 02:34:04,792
Go back, madam. Go back.

1989
02:34:05,458 --> 02:34:11,375
No, Gopi. Now I can't go back.

1990
02:34:12,791 --> 02:34:14,375
And when its not possible
to go back..

1991
02:34:15,100 --> 02:34:17,000
..then its better to go ahead.

1992
02:34:19,125 --> 02:34:21,666
Madam!
- Gopi, oar the boat!

1993
02:34:27,125 --> 02:34:28,708
Jaggu! Jaggu!

1994
02:34:28,791 --> 02:34:31,125
Gauri, you! You have come
here so late in the night!

1995
02:34:31,208 --> 02:34:32,000
What's the matter?

1996
02:34:32,100 --> 02:34:35,791
Don't think! Just come with
me! I need your help!

1997
02:34:35,875 --> 02:34:37,250
Okay! Come! Sit!
- Come on!

1998
02:35:14,100 --> 02:35:15,833
Faster! Faster!

1999
02:35:29,750 --> 02:35:31,125
Faster! Faster!

2000
02:36:08,200 --> 02:36:10,458
Hurry up! Faster!

2001
02:36:26,100 --> 02:36:28,125
Faster!

2002
02:36:57,399 --> 02:36:59,600
You tried everything to win me!

2003
02:37:00,350 --> 02:37:04,666
You tried everything possible.
But you couldn't have me.

2004
02:37:05,149 --> 02:37:09,064
Today you can have everything.

2005
02:37:09,500 --> 02:37:11,000
Gauri!

2006
02:37:11,799 --> 02:37:13,000
But there is one condition.

2007
02:37:13,108 --> 02:37:17,860
In return will you give me
anything I ask for? - What?

2008
02:37:18,500 --> 02:37:22,704
Gopi's life. My Gopi's life.

2009
02:37:26,200 --> 02:37:31,400
Drop the gun. And everything
is yours.

2010
02:37:36,500 --> 02:37:40,166
Gopi! Stop, Gopi!

2011
02:37:40,750 --> 02:37:44,166
Come back! Come back, Gopi!

2012
02:37:47,899 --> 02:37:51,949
Madam! There is a whirlpool
ahead! We will drown!

2013
02:37:53,100 --> 02:37:54,933
No problem, Gopi.

2014
02:37:55,600 --> 02:37:59,604
These heartless people have left
only lie and hatred for us.

2015
02:38:00,350 --> 02:38:02,685
Instead of perishing
in it its better..

2016
02:38:03,350 --> 02:38:06,300
..to die in the holy water of Ganga.

2017
02:38:07,200 --> 02:38:08,365
Madam!

2018
02:38:08,615 --> 02:38:11,450
Madam! Madam! Are you scared?

2019
02:38:12,615 --> 02:38:18,865
Scared? Gopi! It's said that
death separates everybody.

2020
02:38:19,950 --> 02:38:25,990
But this death unites a
few people too. Forever.

2021
02:38:26,240 --> 02:38:28,865
Gopi! Gopi!
- Madam!

2022
02:38:29,782 --> 02:38:31,740
Gopi!
- Madam! Madam!

2023
02:38:32,615 --> 02:38:33,865
Madam!

2024
02:38:36,365 --> 02:38:37,450
Madam!

2025
02:38:40,032 --> 02:38:42,782
Gopi! Gopi!

2026
02:38:44,532 --> 02:38:45,615
Madam!

2027
02:38:45,865 --> 02:38:49,615
Look, Gopi! All the directions
have become one!

2028
02:38:52,282 --> 02:38:54,782
There is no east or west.

2029
02:38:57,282 --> 02:38:58,990
There is no north or south.

2030
02:39:01,615 --> 02:39:03,325
Everything has become one.

2031
02:39:04,615 --> 02:39:07,325
And that one is the truth.

2032
02:39:08,282 --> 02:39:12,449
Truth which is eternal and undying.

2033
02:39:12,950 --> 02:39:15,615
Gopi!
- Madam!

2034
02:39:48,240 --> 02:39:50,365
Gopi!
- Radha!

2035
02:39:52,615 --> 02:39:54,157
Radha!
- Gopi!

2036
02:39:54,240 --> 02:39:55,325
Radha!

2037
02:39:56,200 --> 02:39:58,825
Radha! Radha, you belong to me!

2038
02:39:59,950 --> 02:40:01,283
You are my same Radha!

2039
02:40:02,615 --> 02:40:04,075
You have been mine since
many lifetimes.

2040
02:40:04,365 --> 02:40:05,450
And you will remain mine.

2041
02:40:05,615 --> 02:40:06,990
Gopi!
- Radha!

2042
02:40:07,950 --> 02:40:10,908
Now nobody can separate us!
- Radha!

2043
02:40:11,532 --> 02:40:12,615
Gopi!

2044
02:40:19,157 --> 02:40:29,449
"We both have been singing this
song of love since ages."
