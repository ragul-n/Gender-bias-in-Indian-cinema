00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:10,439
You've arrested me spoiIing my IiveIihood.

There is a new Iaw to arrest

00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:53,314
They marred a temple function
with a stabbing incident.

169
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:57,992
The attitude of Paruthiveeran and Sevvalai is unbearable.

170
00:14:58,163 --> 00:14:59,960
Are you appIying SandaIwood paste?
Make it fast...

171
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:03,498
Don't know when this cold war
will come to an end.

172
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:08,002
- He's the only man to do this right...
- Hey, go that side...

173
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:12,007
Go out & pIay I'm going to change.
Go... make it fast.

174
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:13,337
You wiII never aIIow us pIay.

175
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:18,009
UncIe, suppIied to Maridevar, NaIIidevar
and Mokkapaiyyan.

176
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:18,842
Who eIse then?

177
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:20,518
UncIe and the wine shop owner.

178
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:23,187
- Give them 2 Iarge pieces.
- Get two Iarge pieces.

179
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:26,691
IdIy is getting coId.

180
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:28,189
What is she doing?

181
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,518
She'll then rush to school.

182
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:34,432
Hey Muthalagu...

183
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:37,864
Can't you hear me?

184
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,374
- Why are you pIaying it inside home?
- Don't beat me.

185
00:15:56,488 --> 00:16:00,720
You didn't create any probIem
under infIuence of Iiquor, did you?

186
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:03,451
- No uncIe.
- Don't unnecessariIy get into troubIe.

187
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:06,223
- Don't want to have breakfast?
- I'II eat this.

188
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:06,989
Come on Iet's go

189
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:10,734
Can they go scot free after stabbing
my brother?. We'll avenge it.

190
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:13,599
- We'II settIe it now. Going to schooI?
- How do you feeI then?

191
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:15,069
Okay, go carefuIIy.

192
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:17,903
He's on our side,
he'll not give up on us easily.

193
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:20,910
Why are you going this side?

194
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:22,637
Follow me silently.
Need to explain you everything.

195
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:32,081
- UncIe, are you fine?
- Yes

196
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:36,921
Hey Ponamthinni! Why did you come
here instead of seeing the victim?

197
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:39,757
You were compIaining to me, right?

198
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:40,488
Now teII him.

199
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:43,862
UncIe, isn't there a soIution to
their over bearing attitude?

200
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:46,367
You want us to sit Iike women
without any reaction, right?

201
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:47,834
Did I say so?

202
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,367
You are his brother, aren't you?

203
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:50,740
You go and stab them.

204
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,808
If you can't do it,
hire men and attack them.

205
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,672
you're saying as if I'm stopping you.

206
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:58,940
You always stand by the clan.
What happened now?

207
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:00,642
This is what I am.

208
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,248
Brother, we are taking Ieave.

209
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:03,853
Why Ieaving without having food?

210
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:04,988
It's getting ready.

211
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:06,717
Okay then...

212
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:10,456
- Okay uncIe.
- Okay brother-in-Iaw.

213
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:12,956
What?

214
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,730
Serve coffee to the guests.

215
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:19,597
Though cousins are fighting each other,
I think bIood is thicker than water.

216
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:24,168
Don't insuIt me for your enmity
by saying that.

217
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,106
Don't bIame us if anything
happens to them.

218
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:28,446
We wiII take revenge on them.

219
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:30,579
Don't say it. Do it.

220
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:35,714
Why are you going this side
instead of school?

221
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:39,150
You want to go to schooI? Go...

222
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:39,957
Give my bag.

223
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:41,322
You will never reform.

224
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,596
- Won't they put fans here, uncIe?
- Hey sit down...

225
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:53,661
You want me speciaI instructions?
Get up...

226
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:56,107
Go.

227
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:01,912
Sir, I'm no way connected with them.
PIease reIease me.

228
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:02,705
Hey, shut up!

229
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:04,582
Did you hide the knife
without any connection?

230
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:11,181
Mani, bring that knife.

231
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:12,179
Sit here.

232
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:15,788
Sit properIy. Give your cIothes.

233
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,230
Where is the weapon suppIier?

234
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,666
- He is inside.
- Bring him here.

235
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,675
Sir, why are you calling me?
l want to go home.

236
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:33,469
l say come out...

237
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,710
Sir, I'm no way connected with them.

238
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:38,678
I beIong to a respected famiIy.
Don't invite troubIe.

239
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:40,677
- Shut up and sit.
- Oh my god!

240
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:44,319
You'II face the consequences
of your action.

241
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:45,213
Shut up!

242
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:47,321
Sir, why are you bringing him here?

243
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:48,719
He isn't fit to sit near us.

244
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:50,959
- I hid the knife in merry-go-round.
- What?

245
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:52,425
ls it you who hid the knife?

246
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,963
Hey fool, why did you deny it
for two days then?

247
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:56,496
Didn't l tell you it was me?

248
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:58,192
He has accepted it, hasn't he?

249
00:18:58,437 --> 00:18:59,165
Hey you get up!

250
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:01,364
Why didn't you accept this yesterday?

251
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,904
- Sir, shaII I take Ieave?
- Take him inside. I've to inquire.

252
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,170
- StiII, you'II get nothing.
- Go inside man.

253
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,142
UncIe, give a pose.

254
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,007
Give a smiIe, don't frown.

255
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:19,288
- Hey, get up...
- That's aII?

256
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,118

Get in.

258
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:28,358
- Hey get inside...
- Return my dhoti.

259
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:29,966
Are you trying to steaI my new dhoti?

260
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,133
They will not spare even a loin cloth.

261
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:35,405
- See you then...
- Happy journey, dear.

262
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,721
Hey Karuvachi, stop...won't you?

263

Hey, you can't catch me...

Donkey died... father cry...

- How many cats?
- 1000 cats.

00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:36,060
- For me?

276
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:47,369
Hey, what are you doing here?

277
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:48,545
Your mother is in search of you.

278
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:51,011
I've informed my mother.
You mind your work.

279

Hey, aII are going to town...

Hey fighter cock! He's not interested,

I won't pIay with you.
Get Iost!

291
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,171
Why you hate me?
Why wiII you not pIay with me?

292
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:18,968
No answer.
Take off your hand.

293
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:23,310
Hey Karuvachi, stop...

294
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,516
Oh my god! PIease rescue me from him.

Hey wait...

Hey wait. Your fiance is caIIing you, isn't it?

298
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,355
RepIy me and go.

299
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:35,526
Hey, don't cross your Iimits.
I'II beat you with sIippers.

300
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:39,163
I'm ready for that. You stop first...

301
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:41,628
Hey, turn this side for a moment...

302
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:44,392
You scoundreI... You dirty face!

303
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:49,131
I'II inform this to my father...
- Is your father so fearsome?

304
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:52,037
You'II never forget me in Iife, right?

305
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:53,142
Hey MuthaIagu, you can never forget me.

306
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,137
His son is a wastrel like him!

307
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:57,610
Look SevvaIai is there.

308
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:02,652
Let's rip out the boy's skin.
Such atrocious behaviour at this age!

309
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:07,918
- You've come with an army, brother-in-Iaw?
- Don't caII me as brother-in-Iaw.

310
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,525
I don't want to have any
reIationship with you.

311
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:12,594
Why are you creating troubIe?

312
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:13,929
Where is that scoundreI?

313
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:15,498
Who?

314
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:17,498
Your brother's son!

315
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:19,601
the rogue loitering around the town.

316
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:21,067
Why do you want him?

317
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,137
He has kissed an innocent girI.

318
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:26,933
You both left the house
to teach him this?

319
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:28,543
Hey, don't accuse.

320
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:29,714
He wouId've done it for fun.

321
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:30,973
WouId he do it wantonIy?

322
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,650
What eIse then? Didn't you hear him?
Let's take Ieave.

323
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,081
Hey Ponamthinni!
Have you come for this?

324
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:36,648
- Wait here.
- Okay.

325
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:42,419
You got to have a status to pIay
such things with our girI!

326
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:46,325
Are you and your mother trying to
rejuvenate the reIationship with us?

327
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:49,363
You wiII never Ieave your cheap mentaIity.

328
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:52,002
Hey, are you inviting troubIe voIuntariIy?

329
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,762
If it continues, I'II not care that
you're my brother-in-Iaw.

330
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:54,700
What wiII you do?

331
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:55,770
WiII you cut off my head?

332
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:56,740
Take out your sickIe.

333
00:22:56,942 --> 00:23:00,434
You brought for taIks and
picking up a bIoody fight with him.

334
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:01,709
Doesn't he deserve that right?

335
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:04,882

00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,393
That's why we must brew our own arrack.

510
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:01,458
UncIe, I have a wish.

511
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:02,630
What is it son?

512
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:07,929
I feeI very bored visiting the same
Kamuthi Court & Madurai jaiI.

513
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:11,964
Look at me!

514
00:35:13,077 --> 00:35:14,374
We must commit a big crime

515
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:18,672
and visit Madras jaiI atIeast
once in our Iife time.

516
00:35:19,183 --> 00:35:20,582
Why such a desire?

517
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:25,051
No matter what crime we commit,
the news comes in a page corner.

518
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:28,551
Our photos get pubIished rareIy.

519
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:30,556
But the poIice surround us.

520
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:31,993
If it is in Madras,

521
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,094
they wiII take us in a van,

522
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:34,161
TV media wiII interview us,

523
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:36,993
and uncIe I can say good-bye to you aIso.

524
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:38,795
We can become famous in just a day.

525
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:40,894
- You have toId me, right?
- Yes.

526
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:42,402
- You have toId me, right?
- Yes.

527
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:44,541
- You have toId me, right?
- Yes I have toId you.

528
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:45,342
Forget about it.

529
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:48,235
We wiII commit something big
in the next 6 months.

530
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,104
Okay.

531
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:52,976
- Now have your drink.
- I'II go crazy before making you understand

532
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:53,878
Taste pickIe.

533
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,081
Get me another gIass of arrack.

534
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:08,823
UncIe Iook!

535
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,758
Have you sIept?

536
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:20,401
Get down.

537
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:34,983
What brings you here?

538
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,320
We are here to offer prayers to God.

539
00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:39,925
Is she here to Iight the Iamp?

540
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:43,291
How dare you bring a girI to my pIace?

541
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:46,228
Go. Leave this pIace.

542
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:48,301
Why are you Ieaving?

543
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:50,430
Come here.

544
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:52,199
We gave her the money.

545
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,241
- Money? How much?
- Rs. 100.

546
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:57,514
Rs. 100? Isn't it too much?

547
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:00,816
Okay, you just pay obeisance.

548
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:02,085
I wiII offer the prayers.

549
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:07,348
- Sir...
- Go away.

550
00:37:08,192 --> 00:37:12,720
Just get out.

551
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:14,225
You come inside.

552
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:17,097
You Iook very innocent.

553
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:18,595
WiII you sIeep with anyone who pays you?

554
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,768
GirIs get strangIed and dumped in weIIs.

555
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:24,430
- ls it?
- Don't you read newspaper?.

556
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:26,503
Looks like you are very innocent.

557
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:31,079
I'm the Ione king of the forest.

558
00:37:31,515 --> 00:37:33,779
CoIourfuI roses decorate my garden.

559
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:37,048
I'm a pIay boy.

560
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:41,087
And girIs beautify...stiII here?

561
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:44,727
Since you have finished.
We wiII take care of her.

562
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:46,254
We pinned aII our hopes on her.

563
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:49,558
Go.

564
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:53,064
Inform me whenever you bring girIs here.

565
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:55,769
- Let's share the joy.
- Okay.

566
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:56,632
Go.

567
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:57,906
- Sir.
- Yes.

568
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:01,109
- Inform us whenever you bring girIs here.
- What?

569
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:04,145
- Inform us whenever you bring girIs here.
- Oh Sure.

570
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:06,643
You are getting smart with me.

571
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:34,001
Get up.

572
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:35,612
FuIIy drunk!

573
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:36,739
Get up.

574
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:44,016
Is it you?

575
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:47,589
Thank God! I thought someone eIse.

576
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:50,989
You are so scared,
why do you stab others then?

577
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:54,728
I'm not scared. I am very aIert.

578
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:56,763
I can see that from your face.

579
00:38:57,201 --> 00:38:58,600
You commit some crime & go to jaiI.

580
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:00,896
ShouId I wait for your reIease?

581
00:39:01,472 --> 00:39:02,268
Who asked you to wait for me?

582
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:04,498
- Go & study.
- Where are you going?

583
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:08,668
- Leave my dhoti. I'm not wearing brief.
- Sit down.

584
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:09,809
I said sit down.

585
00:39:10,581 --> 00:39:13,379
You are a goon to others not for me.

586
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,747
- Sit.
- Leave it.

587
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:16,817
I said sit.

588
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:18,355
PIanning to escape?

589
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,012
But I won't Ieave you.

590
00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:22,284
Leave it, I may get stripped.

591
00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:28,297
TeII me whether that woman
is Iooking at us or not.

592
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:32,033
Why shouId I check that for you?
Wait...I'II check.

593
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,434
Yes. She is Iooking at us.

594
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,607
She wiII teII your father.

595
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:40,336
I know what she wiII do.
You sit down.

596
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:43,037
You stabbed a man in the viIIage festivaI.

597
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:44,942
What if his men had kiIIed you there?

598
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:50,746
- Leave this worId. Is it a big deaI?
- Am I here to see you getting kiIIed?

599
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:52,815
You can't die so easiIy.

600
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,325
You must marry & Iive with me.

601
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:59,026
Don't you've to get the stick for aII the
crimes you've ever committed.

602
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,720
You are taIking too much. Leave it.

603
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:02,965
You wanted me to promise you.

604
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,461
- Now, don't you need me?
- I do that everyday.

605
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:07,034
- What?
- What is your probIem?

606
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:07,795
Leave my dhoti.

607
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:15,375
I am not joking.

608
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:19,279
Don't ever think that I wiII marry
someone eIse and have chiIdren.

609
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:24,744
I sworn to God that I'II show
my nude body onIy to you.

610
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:29,417
If my father, mother or
you try to aIter it,

611
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:31,389
I wiII die.

612
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:37,795
Say something good earIy morning
not about death. Go.

613
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:40,228
You disturbed my sIeep to teII this.

614
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:43,603
Go I say.

615
00:40:47,678 --> 00:40:51,011
Her friends are married and
have children now.

616
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:54,514
But she's roaming like a lone cow.

617
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:57,616
EarIier she used to Iisten to parents.

618
00:40:57,822 --> 00:41:00,382
But now she decides on her own.

619
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:03,788
- Don't taunt me.
- Why shouId I?

620
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:05,895
TeII me, where are you coming from?

621
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:08,360
That woman must have toId you everything.

622
00:41:08,732 --> 00:41:10,563
Do you want to hear from
the horse's mouth?

623
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:13,895
Your words and actions aren't right.

624
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:16,433
It is your good time that
he is not at home.

625
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,542
- If he knows this, he'II kiII you.
- What wiII he do?

626
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:23,144
You & the viIIagers are scared of him.

627
00:41:24,448 --> 00:41:25,608
How dare you say that!

628
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:28,611
- I wiII kiII you...
- Go ahead.

629
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:35,116
Why are you shouting so IoudIy?

630
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:36,520
She is not heIping me at home.

631
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,421
You don't even question her.

632
00:41:38,762 --> 00:41:42,994
From fetching water to washing cIothes,

633
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,824
I do every thing. She is shouting at me.

634
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:46,601
Then why are you shouting Iike heII?

635
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:48,965
Your ego isn't satisfied tiII
you comment on me.

636
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,211
MuthaIagu, come here.

637
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:03,351
Do you know, your mother
came in the morning?

638
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:04,248
I know.

639
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:05,453
What is the probIem at home?

640
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:06,179
Nothing.

641
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:09,391
I heard that your mom and
you had an argument.

642
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:12,184
She came to see you today.

643
00:42:12,396 --> 00:42:13,556
She cares so much about you.

644
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:17,063
She wouId've come to check whether
I am in schooI or in the forest.

645
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:18,925
You are a schooI going girI.

646
00:42:19,169 --> 00:42:21,637
He spends most of the time in jaiI.

647
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:23,329
How couId you faII in Iove with him?

648
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:27,672
- Aren't you ashamed to faiI 4 years for him?
- Why shouId I?

649
00:42:28,178 --> 00:42:30,476
If you don't Iike me,
I won't come to schooI.

650
00:42:31,148 --> 00:42:33,013
I've studied enough to become his wife.

651
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:36,378
- Why are you so rude with everyone for him?
- Rude?

652
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:38,582
I wouId have been dead
when I was 8 years oId.

653
00:42:39,623 --> 00:42:40,487
If he wasn't there to save my Iife.

654
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:42,589
I must give myseIf to him.

655
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:55,632
You oId man! Take it.

656
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:58,171
Staring at a woman's photo!

657
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,809
They are here again.

658
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:04,008
Prepare 2 cups of tea for us.

659
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:05,712
Special or ordinary?

660
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:07,781
- SpeciaI.
- UncIe, how are you?

661
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:14,314
- TeII me.
- You're very affectionate today.

662
00:43:14,558 --> 00:43:16,526
- Come, Iet's go.
- Why so earIy?

663
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:17,586
Let's go.

664
00:43:17,795 --> 00:43:19,023
- Let me finish my tea.
- Come I say.

665
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:21,094
- How was this!
- Great.

666
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:24,326
Though you both are reIatives,
he is a respectabIe man in this viIIage.

667
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:26,264
Teasing him in public place.

668
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:29,997
Atleast respect his age.

669
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:33,335
Sevvalai, you are with him always.
Can't you advice him?

670
00:43:33,544 --> 00:43:34,442
He never Iistens to me.

671
00:43:34,745 --> 00:43:37,908
I toId him to reform before some dog
starts advising you. But he doesn't care.

672
00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:39,172
Since you have toId me today.

673
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:41,541
Am I your scapegoat for today?

674
00:43:41,852 --> 00:43:43,285
Drink tea & Ieave the pIace.

675
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:46,547
- Let your owner say that.
- Who?

676
00:43:47,925 --> 00:43:48,448
DougIas brother.

677
00:43:48,892 --> 00:43:49,859
Douglas...?

678
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:53,120
I hired him yesterday onIy.

679
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:54,422
Are you the owner of this shop?

680
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:56,156
Give him respect.

681
00:43:56,433 --> 00:44:00,529
- He feIt pity & hired you.
- What can he offer me?

682
00:44:00,738 --> 00:44:02,467
Is this what you teII everyone

683
00:44:02,673 --> 00:44:04,163
- How was that?
- Great.

684
00:44:04,441 --> 00:44:06,739
You might have said that.
Get out.

685
00:44:12,783 --> 00:44:14,842
- Happy...?
- So, you are not the owner.

686
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:15,847
Get lost.

687
00:44:16,754 --> 00:44:18,016
He said that to me.

688
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:19,450
Now I know he had Iied to me.

689
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:27,122
What do you want me to do?

690
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:30,299
You boozed Iast evening

691
00:44:31,101 --> 00:44:33,695
You are coming to
SakthiveI tempIe tomorrow.

692
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:35,099
I wiII be waiting there.
We wiII offer prayers together.

693
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:36,237
Why shouId I pray?

694
00:44:36,473 --> 00:44:37,872
I can't teII you aII that.
You are coming.

695
00:44:38,242 --> 00:44:39,038
Okay. I wiII come.

696
00:44:42,112 --> 00:44:46,014
If you faiI to come on my birthday,

00:44:47,384 --> 00:44:50,012
PIease do so.
He is irresponsibIe.

699
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:54,253
How is your mother?
Does she know that you are coming here?

700
00:44:54,758 --> 00:44:56,453
She doesn't know. But she is fine.

701
00:44:56,794 --> 00:44:59,194
Why don't you come home & see her?

702
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:01,990
Why shouId I come?
ShouId I come & see her?

703
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:04,599
- To heII with her.
- Okay. You don't need to come.

704
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:07,595
Don't Iet him sIeep tiII 10 O'cIock.

705
00:45:07,938 --> 00:45:10,873
- Send him on time.
- Am I singing a IuIIaby?

706
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:13,339
Get up. She has come for you.
But you are stiII sIeeping.

707
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,375
She has no other job.

708
00:45:29,626 --> 00:45:32,720
She told you to be somewhere.

709
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:36,098
- Didn't you go?
- l'm going elsewhere because of her.

710
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:37,424
Don't act.

711
00:45:37,701 --> 00:45:39,566
You fight with everyone in the village.

712
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:42,068
You beat others if they
say anything wrong.

713
00:45:42,272 --> 00:45:45,298
But she shouts at you so much,
but you never say anything.

714
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:48,201
- You have a soft corner for her.
- I can't go after her.

715
00:45:48,445 --> 00:45:50,174
It is not good for a guy Iike me.

716
00:45:51,148 --> 00:45:52,479
Are you such a good man?

717
00:45:52,883 --> 00:45:53,907
You kissed her when you
were just 10 years oId

718
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:55,949
And daringIy accepted it before eIders.

719
00:45:56,153 --> 00:45:57,313
Now acting innocence?

720
00:45:57,855 --> 00:45:59,823
If you Iike her, take her away.

721
00:46:00,324 --> 00:46:04,124
We don't know when we wiII get kiIIed.

722
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:05,621
How can I desire to Iive with her?

723
00:46:06,663 --> 00:46:08,893
- What wouId happen to our goaI?
- What goaI?

724
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:13,468
I mean the TV, interview,
Madras jaiI.

725
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:16,339
Looks Iike you won't take me there.

726
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:17,837
How couId you go back
on your promise?

727
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:20,475
She is after you aII the time.

728
00:46:20,677 --> 00:46:23,237
She wiII forget me if I chase
her away a coupIe of times.

729
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:24,708
Poor girI!

730
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:29,013
She is tormenting me.

731
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:30,378
You caII her a poor girI.

732
00:46:30,654 --> 00:46:31,780
Infact I am the poor souI.

733
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:35,656
EarIier she was very bIack.

734
00:46:36,426 --> 00:46:37,552
But now she has turned bright.

735
00:46:37,761 --> 00:46:40,127
If you have money,
you can make crows aIso fairer.

736
00:46:40,764 --> 00:46:42,891
Don't say things just Iike that.

737
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:44,727
WiII you become fair if you get money?

738
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:47,426
Do you know how fair I was as a kid?

739
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,037
The hot sun made me dark.

740
00:47:04,955 --> 00:47:05,887
Dash.

741
00:47:07,624 --> 00:47:08,591
Don't leave him.

742
00:47:09,092 --> 00:47:10,582
Good.

743
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:13,485
Good.

744
00:47:30,948 --> 00:47:32,381
He is caIIing you.

745
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:35,518
Why wouId they caII me?
WiII he get his daughter married to me?

746
00:47:36,053 --> 00:47:38,248
Hey you...

747
00:47:38,822 --> 00:47:39,754
They are caIIing me.

748
00:47:42,426 --> 00:47:43,415
What is your probIem?

749
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:44,953
What do you want?

750
00:47:56,506 --> 00:47:58,838
Drawing out knives wiII not
make you a fighter.

751
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:01,738
You need to have guts to be
brave not any weapon.

752
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,741
You are right. TeII that to him who
was stabbed on buttocks.

753
00:48:04,948 --> 00:48:06,540
They caIIed me to say this.

754
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:07,910
May be they are you friends.

755
00:48:08,118 --> 00:48:09,779
They are bIabbering without even drinking.

756
00:48:09,987 --> 00:48:11,284
We didn't get you on the other day.

757
00:48:11,488 --> 00:48:12,921
We wouId have cut your baIIs.

758
00:48:40,217 --> 00:48:44,017
Leave me uncIe, Iet me finish it
once for aII, group is not strength.

759
00:48:44,488 --> 00:48:45,750
They are provoking you wantonIy.

760
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:57,251
You have been here since morning.

761
00:49:57,394 --> 00:49:58,725
Who are you waiting here for?

762
00:49:59,596 --> 00:50:01,063
I am waiting to your husband.

763
00:50:01,598 --> 00:50:05,227
We had pIanned to go to

765

What? Waiting go to a cinema?

767
00:50:10,941 --> 00:50:14,399
Today's youth are not trustworthy.

768
00:50:14,611 --> 00:50:16,238
You may do it, my man is
aIso not a gentIeman.

769
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:29,422
What happened to you?

770
00:50:29,626 --> 00:50:33,084
Sitting IoneIy, taIking and
shaking the hands.

771
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:35,264
Was it Iike that to you?

772
00:50:35,632 --> 00:50:38,601
Nothing, I'm practicing music.

773
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:39,765
You know?

774
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:44,930
I don't know? I know onIy my jobs.

How Iong you wiII you be Iike this?

00:50:48,478 --> 00:50:50,173
Why shouId we try to be Iike her?

778

How toId this type.
You come, I wiII teach music for you.

779
00:50:53,817 --> 00:50:57,776
I am very tried. I can't Iearn music.

780
00:50:57,988 --> 00:51:03,893
Shut up, I was yearning to Iearn music.
Let's try to Iearn music.

781
00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:06,187
Mother come on, I wiII teach you.

Don't make any mistakes.

785
00:51:16,173 --> 00:51:18,300
Why is she scaring us?

786
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:26,641
We can't sing that. You sing.

787
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:29,477
- Listen.
- We can't sing.

788

How couId you Ieave us here?

00:52:34,017 --> 00:52:37,475
Drink it. You will feel music
in your tongue.

799
00:52:37,888 --> 00:52:40,015
You don't need musical pipes.

800
00:52:40,223 --> 00:52:46,184
l will teach you the
musical notes for free.

801

A idle girl has many husbands.

Only a marriage can control
your mischief.

803
00:53:00,544 --> 00:53:12,012

Do you have the interest to learn?

00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:02,701

00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:21,648

Singing songs to all those passing by.

812
00:54:29,499 --> 00:54:32,627

He wiII ask me for his share.

823
00:55:49,946 --> 00:55:53,882
Who kept this here?

824

Who are they?

Are they coming from circus company?

827
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:03,985
Don't puII my hand.

00:58:02,545 --> 00:58:04,672
Why do you ask me when you know it?

855
00:58:04,881 --> 00:58:08,681
You scoundreI!
How dare you speak Iike that?

856
00:58:10,553 --> 00:58:12,680
What's making you to go after him?

857
00:58:13,389 --> 00:58:15,118
I wiII kiII you.

858
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:17,350
Why are you insuIting us?

859
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:19,528
You act as if you know nothing.

860
00:58:19,729 --> 00:58:21,526
Why are you beating me?
Have you gone mad?

861
00:58:21,731 --> 00:58:23,528
Are you trying to rebuiId
the oId reIationship?

862
00:58:23,733 --> 00:58:26,531
It is you & your famiIy who do it.

863
00:58:26,736 --> 00:58:30,263
Get your daughter married to someone
or kiII her. I don't care.

864
00:58:30,406 --> 00:58:31,532
Why shouId I suffer
because of you both?

865
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:35,040
You oId woman! Die.

866
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,906
How many times to teII you
to perform her marriage?

867
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:40,913
But you never Iisten to me.

868
00:58:41,117 --> 00:58:43,847
You wanted an educated groom.

869
00:58:44,053 --> 00:58:45,111
Now you feeI the heat.

870
00:58:45,889 --> 00:58:49,256
Where are you going? Come here.

871
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:54,689
What wiII you do?
The same bIood runs in my body too.

872
00:58:55,665 --> 00:58:59,999
Why are you beating her?

873
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:02,797
You bitch!
How dare you speak Iike that?

874
00:59:03,339 --> 00:59:06,467
Don't beat her.

875
00:59:14,751 --> 00:59:17,379
You better die.

876
00:59:20,356 --> 00:59:23,325
If I waIk on the shit by mistake,
I wiII cut my Ieg.

877
00:59:23,693 --> 00:59:26,218
But you want to bring the
stench to our home.

878
00:59:26,863 --> 00:59:33,564
It started from your famiIy
and it is stiII haunting me.

879
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:38,230
I was careIess when peopIe toId me.

880
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:42,773
But today I saw her with him.

881
00:59:43,546 --> 00:59:45,514
You compIained about him when
he kissed you as a IittIe girI.

882
00:59:45,715 --> 00:59:48,843
I was very happy. But today...

883
00:59:53,623 --> 00:59:56,353
If this had happened in
someone eIse's famiIy,

884
00:59:56,626 --> 00:59:58,685
I wouIdn't be abIe to bear it.
But you are bringing him into my famiIy.

885
00:59:59,228 --> 01:00:01,788
Stop going to schooI.

886
01:00:02,165 --> 01:00:06,864
If you go to schooI...
I wiII kiII you aII & go to jaiI.

887
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:15,370
She is not Iistening to us.

888
01:00:16,746 --> 01:00:19,977
Why are you crying? Is someone dead?
Serve me meat.

889
01:00:23,086 --> 01:00:31,892
- Why do you behave Iike this?
- Serve some more. I said more.

890
01:00:33,196 --> 01:00:38,498
My body needs strength
to take his beatings.

891
01:00:53,683 --> 01:00:54,581
Stop Iooking at me.

892
01:01:02,625 --> 01:01:04,752
Come on. Let's pIay.

893
01:01:05,628 --> 01:01:06,754
For me...?

894
01:01:06,963 --> 01:01:07,759
Do you have money?

895
01:01:07,964 --> 01:01:09,932
I am your uncIe.
Asking me money?

896
01:01:10,133 --> 01:01:11,760
ReIations don't matter in gambIing.

897
01:01:11,968 --> 01:01:13,265
Won't you Iend me money?

898
01:01:13,469 --> 01:01:16,438
Borrowing & Iending is not
in gambIing. Sit aside.

899
01:01:18,307 --> 01:01:19,865
Put it down.

900
01:01:20,076 --> 01:01:21,543
- It's aIright.
- Put it down I say.

901
01:01:21,744 --> 01:01:23,109
Throwing weight on me?

902
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:25,880
She tattooed on your chest.

903
01:01:26,082 --> 01:01:28,607
It was he who bought the Iiquor bottIe.

904
01:01:28,818 --> 01:01:30,445
- You'II pay for it.
- What?

905
01:01:30,653 --> 01:01:32,280
I didn't do it intentionaIIy.

906
01:01:32,488 --> 01:01:35,286
You got drunk because it was free.

907
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:38,288
Have they sent you out?

908
01:01:38,461 --> 01:01:39,428
Do you have money?

909
01:01:39,662 --> 01:01:41,789
It is in the Iocker.
But I don't have the key.

910
01:01:42,932 --> 01:01:46,299
How can I have money
if I am with you guys?

911
01:01:46,502 --> 01:01:47,628
- You want money, right?
- Yes.

912
01:01:47,837 --> 01:01:49,964
Get him. He has Iot of money.

913
01:01:50,339 --> 01:01:53,968
He is a pauper.
How couId he have money?

914
01:01:54,177 --> 01:01:55,701
He does have money.

915
01:01:56,746 --> 01:01:59,146
- Hey DougIas...
- Yes.

916
01:01:59,348 --> 01:02:00,042
Come here.

917
01:02:00,349 --> 01:02:02,977
Say it from there itseIf.
I am busy.

918
01:02:03,186 --> 01:02:04,483
Do you have money?

919
01:02:04,687 --> 01:02:06,655
Yes. I do have.
What's bothering you?

920
01:02:06,856 --> 01:02:07,720
How did you get money?

921
01:02:07,924 --> 01:02:10,654
I borrowed it for interest
to buy a cow.

922
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:12,491
Cow? For what?

923
01:02:12,695 --> 01:02:16,153
No one can spoiI my business.
I am the owner.

924
01:02:16,365 --> 01:02:18,333
OnIy I shouId spoiI my business.

925
01:02:18,534 --> 01:02:23,164
- Just find out what it is.
- This is our Iast meeting.

926
01:02:23,372 --> 01:02:23,838
What is it?

927
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:25,667
Today, you wiII buy a cow.

928
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:28,173
Tomorrow, you wiII buy Iand, buiId a house
and become viIIage president.

929
01:02:28,377 --> 01:02:32,006
You wiII contest eIections, become
an MLA, Minister and then CM.

930
01:02:32,215 --> 01:02:34,012
But shouId we remain pasting
your posters aII our Iife?

931
01:02:34,217 --> 01:02:35,684
You wiII go in a car.

932
01:02:35,885 --> 01:02:37,682
I was just going to buy a cow.

933
01:02:37,887 --> 01:02:39,684
But you are taIking about my posters!

934
01:02:39,889 --> 01:02:40,856
What do you want?

935
01:02:41,057 --> 01:02:43,525
Can't you see them pIaying cards?
Why don't you aIso pIay?

936
01:02:43,993 --> 01:02:47,190
- I have Iot of work. Leave me.
- Come.

937
01:02:47,396 --> 01:02:50,695
You are pIanning to make
me your scapegoat.

938
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:51,525
But I am very cIever.

939
01:02:51,734 --> 01:02:52,359
Sit down.

940
01:02:52,668 --> 01:02:53,532
You pIay.

941
01:02:57,406 --> 01:02:58,805
Why rope?

942
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:01,470
Stupid question?

943
01:03:01,677 --> 01:03:04,874
To tie the cow.
I can't put a cow in my pocket.

944
01:03:05,081 --> 01:03:08,050
I have Iot of work. Make it fast.

945
01:03:08,518 --> 01:03:09,712
How much wiII money wiII you stake?

946
01:03:09,919 --> 01:03:11,147
How much do you want?

947
01:03:11,521 --> 01:03:15,548
You are the king of knives.
I am the king of cards.

948
01:03:15,758 --> 01:03:23,062
If I start to pIay aII the jokers
wiII be mine. PIay.

949
01:03:23,533 --> 01:03:24,727
Is Rs. 200 okay?

950
01:03:24,934 --> 01:03:27,494
- As you pIease.
- Cut this card.

951
01:03:30,606 --> 01:03:32,904
Go & get me a drink boy.

952
01:03:33,109 --> 01:03:37,239
- Let's have it after winning.
- Is it? Okay.

953
01:03:42,752 --> 01:03:45,243
How can I finish game
if I've 13 jokers?

954
01:03:50,459 --> 01:03:51,926
Can l get you a soft drink?

955
01:03:52,128 --> 01:03:57,691
Get me a beer. I wiII win.
Just wait. I wiII finish it off.

956
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:04,097
Show. Game over.

957
01:04:06,409 --> 01:04:08,001
ShaII I get you a soft drink?

958
01:04:10,046 --> 01:04:11,604
Okay. You play.

959
01:04:11,814 --> 01:04:13,645
I wiII get back what I Iost.
Now I put Rs. 500.

960
01:04:17,753 --> 01:04:21,382
Did you see Paruthiveeran & SevvaIai?

961
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:24,888
You take bribes from them
and set them free.

962
01:04:25,094 --> 01:04:26,891
I wonder how many are going
to suffer because of them.

963
01:04:27,096 --> 01:04:28,563
What are you taIking about?

964
01:04:28,764 --> 01:04:29,731
They are on top.

965
01:04:29,932 --> 01:04:31,729
And they have Iots of money.
Go and take your share.

966
01:04:31,934 --> 01:04:34,732
- What is the rope around your neck?
- To commit suicide. Go.

967
01:04:35,104 --> 01:04:39,404
WouId they appIy turmeric powder
to money to buy a cow, uncIe?

968
01:04:39,609 --> 01:04:40,906
Where shouId I search for you?

969
01:04:41,477 --> 01:04:43,570
You've become too arrogant.

970
01:04:43,946 --> 01:04:45,243
Won't you come and sign
properIy in the station?

971
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:46,574
They are shouting at us.

972
01:04:46,782 --> 01:04:48,750
Since you take bribe from us,
take their stick too.

973
01:04:48,951 --> 01:04:50,418
Give that to me.

974
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:51,587
Why didn't you come to
the court Iast time?

975
01:04:51,787 --> 01:04:53,414
You are coming to the court tomorrow.

976
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:54,419
We have to recaII the warrant.

977
01:04:54,624 --> 01:04:56,251
You have taken aII the money.

978
01:04:57,126 --> 01:04:57,592
Take it.

979
01:04:58,227 --> 01:04:59,251
What is this for?

980
01:04:59,462 --> 01:05:01,589
Is this your hard earned money?

981
01:05:01,797 --> 01:05:05,096
You can't have aII the money. Give it.

982
01:05:05,468 --> 01:05:06,765
How dare you take money from
a poIiceman's pocket?

983
01:05:13,643 --> 01:05:17,602
l'll wear his uniform
and take a photo.

984
01:05:17,813 --> 01:05:19,610
No, uncIe,
he is just a constabIe.

985
01:05:19,815 --> 01:05:21,043
I wiII get the cIothes of the Inspector.

986
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:25,949
- He is too heavy.
- Lets make pickIe out of him.

987
01:05:26,322 --> 01:05:29,120
He removed my dhoti
infront of everyone.

988
01:05:29,325 --> 01:05:30,792
That's why I want to
remove his cIothes.

989
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:33,125
But you promised me to
get me Inspector's uniform.

990
01:05:33,496 --> 01:05:37,398
Do we have to Iift this pig?

991
01:05:39,502 --> 01:05:43,404
Here is the tempIe.
Let's shave his head.

992
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:46,632
Do anything you want.
But first, Iet's put him down.

993
01:05:47,243 --> 01:05:49,643
He must be around 150 kgs.
Put him down.

994
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:55,478
UncIe...

995
01:05:58,587 --> 01:05:59,485
Just one minute.

996
01:06:15,771 --> 01:06:18,604
When he insuIted you by
removing your dhoti,

997
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:20,435
- we were quiet.
- Yes.

998
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:24,101
When he Iooted money from us,
we kept quiet.

999
01:06:24,547 --> 01:06:29,348
But today, he sIapped me for
taking money from his pocket

1000
01:06:29,552 --> 01:06:31,349
and insuIted our entire cIan.

1001
01:06:31,554 --> 01:06:34,284
It is a great insuIt.

1002
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:36,287
Enough of keeping quiet.
Come out.

1003
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:38,357
Where is your knife? Take it.

1004
01:06:41,063 --> 01:06:44,590
...cut it.
- Yes, my Iord.

1005
01:06:46,469 --> 01:06:48,369
The judge feIt pity on us.

1006
01:06:48,571 --> 01:06:50,971
Even the Goddess of justice
felt pity on us.

1007
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:52,936
Both my reIatives & neighbours forgot us.

1008
01:06:53,142 --> 01:06:56,373
- UncIe, I have cut it.
- Is it? Leave me.

1009
01:06:58,814 --> 01:07:02,147
Run boy. He has cut the police man's ear.

1010
01:07:06,088 --> 01:07:09,057
- You know this?
- What?

1011
01:07:09,258 --> 01:07:12,955
Your nephew and your brother
have cut a poIiceman's ear.

1012
01:07:13,162 --> 01:07:15,494
- What are you saying?
- Yes. It is true.

1013
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:18,895
They did this to him when he went
to teII them to come to the court.

1014
01:07:19,101 --> 01:07:23,231
Is it true? So, they wiII not reform.

1015
01:07:23,439 --> 01:07:26,567
Not onIy that, they are on run.

1016
01:07:26,776 --> 01:07:29,745
Police is interrogating your mother.

1017
01:07:30,112 --> 01:07:31,909
Why don't you go & see her once?

1018
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:33,848
There are stiII many issues unsoIved.

1019
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:37,076
Are you pIanning to send me
out of this house?

1020
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:41,254
He is already furious on them.

1021
01:07:46,629 --> 01:07:50,588
If we surrender to the court,
we needn't have to go hiding.

1022
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:52,597
- It's aII because of you.
- What?

1023
01:07:53,202 --> 01:07:55,762
You shouId have beaten him.
But you cut his ear.

1024
01:07:56,205 --> 01:07:57,832
It was you who toId me
to cut his ear.

1025
01:07:58,040 --> 01:07:59,200
But trying to put the bIame on me now.

1026
01:07:59,408 --> 01:08:00,602
When did I teII you?

1027
01:08:00,810 --> 01:08:02,607
You spoke Iike the King Kattabomman.

1028
01:08:02,978 --> 01:08:04,605
Trying to bIame it on me.

1029
01:08:04,814 --> 01:08:05,781
I know you very weII.

1030
01:08:05,981 --> 01:08:11,783
It was so hot that I bIabbered.
But you cut his ear.

1031
01:08:11,854 --> 01:08:14,288
Looks Iike we won't see Madras JaiI

1032
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:18,790
and will spend all our lives
in the jails down south.

1033
01:08:18,994 --> 01:08:21,053
We wiII find someone for that too.

1034
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:24,289
Police are coming to catch you both.

1035
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:25,899
I can hear that boy's voice.

1036
01:08:27,002 --> 01:08:27,730
Is it?

1037
01:08:30,172 --> 01:08:31,139
Police are here to catch you.

1038
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:35,470
UncIe, they are here.
They beat us to puIp. Run.

1039
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:41,242
Run. Don't get caught.

1040
01:08:44,353 --> 01:08:46,821
UncIe, don't get caught. Run.

1041
01:08:48,691 --> 01:08:51,558
- Do you think you can catch me?
- Stop throwing sand on me. Stop.

1042
01:09:03,739 --> 01:09:06,799
What are you doing here with
a deaf guy to guard the house?

1043
01:09:09,845 --> 01:09:11,142
Do you know this?

1044
01:09:11,347 --> 01:09:13,907
SevvaIai & Paruthiveeran have
surrendered in Manamadurai court.

1045
01:09:16,752 --> 01:09:19,312
You're busy cutting your hair
when I am so serious.

1046
01:09:19,522 --> 01:09:21,649
Why are taIking about
those dogs with me?

1047
01:09:21,857 --> 01:09:27,318
They can't come out so easiIy.
The case is very strong.

1048
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:28,724
It wiII take 6 months
for them to come out.

1049
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:32,161
Why don't we find a boy and
get MuthaIagu married now?

1050
01:09:32,368 --> 01:09:33,266
Do you understand?

1051
01:09:33,536 --> 01:09:35,902
Say something.

1052
01:09:36,539 --> 01:09:41,670
OnIy today you have given
me a perfect idea.

1053
01:09:41,977 --> 01:09:44,241
Find a boy in your side.

1054
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:46,505
Let's conduct her marriage in 10 days.

1055
01:10:40,703 --> 01:10:46,073
What did you consume?

1056
01:10:46,275 --> 01:10:48,243
Come & see my grand daughter.

1057
01:10:48,444 --> 01:10:51,743
Muthu, what happened to you?
You scoundreI!

1058
01:10:51,947 --> 01:10:53,005
See what she has done to herseIf.

1059
01:10:53,215 --> 01:10:55,581
Did you fix the aIIiance to kiII her?

1060
01:10:56,051 --> 01:10:59,350
Get Iost. Even you were with him.

1061
01:10:59,622 --> 01:11:00,589
I don't need your heIp.

1062
01:11:00,789 --> 01:11:02,416
I wiII take care of my grand daughter.

1063
01:11:03,459 --> 01:11:04,926
What l'm going to do?

1064
01:11:05,461 --> 01:11:07,929
Somebody heIp me.

1065
01:11:12,301 --> 01:11:17,762
- Did you scoId her?
- Why wouId I scoId her?

1066
01:11:24,146 --> 01:11:26,273
Put a knot around her waist.

1067
01:11:32,488 --> 01:11:35,457
Open your eyes, dear.

1068
01:11:36,992 --> 01:11:39,460
Please save her.

1069
01:11:43,599 --> 01:11:47,626
You already took 2 lives in
the name of caste.

1070
01:11:48,003 --> 01:11:50,062
Do you want to kill her too?

1071
01:12:10,592 --> 01:12:14,050
I think your wife wiII beat you for
Iosing aII your money here.

1072
01:12:14,263 --> 01:12:16,390
I am warning you.
Finish off with this game.

1073
01:12:16,598 --> 01:12:18,225
- Keep quiet.
- PIay...

1074
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,898
- Wait, why are you in a hurry?
- Here is the money.

1075
01:12:21,103 --> 01:12:22,570
The business is going down everyday.

1076
01:12:22,771 --> 01:12:25,899
Count it & keep the arrack inside.

1077
01:12:27,576 --> 01:12:31,103
Looks Iike you have brought
back most of the stock.

1078
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:34,408
Am I going to a town
to seII for thousands?

1079
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:37,578
How can I do business
when I've a competitor?

1080
01:12:37,786 --> 01:12:40,983
- Who is the other guy?
- Sivanandi.

1081
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:42,748
Why are they seIIing in our area?

1082
01:12:43,625 --> 01:12:45,752
Did you seII in their area?

1083
01:12:45,961 --> 01:12:48,429
Why would l do that?

1084
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:49,927
Joker & show.

1085
01:12:50,632 --> 01:12:53,499
The game is over.
Keep the money down.

1086
01:12:55,504 --> 01:12:57,028
Where are they doing the business?

1087
01:13:17,926 --> 01:13:23,125
Go & teII your brother.
He might just waIk away.

1088
01:13:23,499 --> 01:13:25,228
Can't you keep quiet?

1089
01:13:25,434 --> 01:13:28,028
Why ruin my Iiving?

1090
01:13:28,370 --> 01:13:29,735
Go & mind your work.

1091
01:13:31,373 --> 01:13:33,739
I think you're poking your nose
into unnecessary things.

1092
01:13:35,344 --> 01:13:39,303
For brewing arrack and
doing business for her,

1093
01:13:40,115 --> 01:13:42,083
she kiIIed our own men.

1094
01:13:42,785 --> 01:13:45,345
If she hadn't done it,
I wouId've done it.

1095
01:13:46,555 --> 01:13:47,522
Our own men...?

1096
01:13:48,190 --> 01:13:51,648
Who came to our rescue
when we were dying in hunger?

1097
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:53,587
Where did these men come from?

1098
01:13:53,796 --> 01:13:56,094
We can't Iive abandon aII our reIations
and Iead a soIitary Iife.

1099
01:13:56,298 --> 01:13:57,424
We need someone by our side.

1100
01:13:58,133 --> 01:13:59,930
Why do it for her?

1101
01:14:00,135 --> 01:14:03,104
Let's brew arrack behind our house
start our own business.

1102
01:14:03,305 --> 01:14:03,930
Our house?

1103
01:14:04,139 --> 01:14:07,108
The pIace you are sitting,
your cIothes, the food we eat,

1104
01:14:07,309 --> 01:14:10,278
- Everything is her mercy.
- Don't keep repeating it.

1105
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:13,605
I don't need her mercy.

1106
01:14:13,982 --> 01:14:16,610
And I don't want to Iive such a Iife either.

1107
01:14:16,819 --> 01:14:18,616
Now you are taIking with Iot of pride.

1108
01:14:18,821 --> 01:14:19,617
When you married her,

1109
01:14:19,822 --> 01:14:27,558
your mother asked for 13 sovereigns
of goId as dowry & got it too.

1110
01:14:28,497 --> 01:14:31,125
I borrowed money from
that Iady for that too.

1111
01:14:31,333 --> 01:14:32,459
You soId that too.

1112
01:14:33,602 --> 01:14:36,036
Let caste & reIations be with you.

1113
01:14:36,338 --> 01:14:37,965
I want to be faithfuI to the one
who gives us daiIy bread.

1114
01:14:38,273 --> 01:14:39,467
I know onIy that.

1115
01:14:40,008 --> 01:14:41,976
- I don't care about anything.
- What I mean to say is that

1116
01:14:42,177 --> 01:14:45,977
If the victims' famiIies come to me...
- Send them to me.

1117
01:14:46,181 --> 01:14:47,079
I wiII handIe them.

1118
01:14:47,282 --> 01:14:48,715
You don't have to be my mouthpiece.

1119
01:14:50,352 --> 01:14:52,320
No matter whatever I teII him,
he doesn't Iisten to me at aII.

1120
01:14:53,255 --> 01:14:54,483
He doesn't even respect me.

1121
01:14:54,690 --> 01:14:56,988
Has she mesmerized him?
He is aIways seen in her house.

1122
01:14:57,192 --> 01:15:01,322
Why bIame him?
Let's send them both to heII.

1123
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:03,498
Don't do anything stupid.

1124
01:15:03,699 --> 01:15:08,033
It is we who have Iost men.
Don't we have any honour.

1125
01:15:08,370 --> 01:15:11,066
- We can't Ieave her.
- I didn't stop you.

1126
01:15:12,574 --> 01:15:19,070
Do anything you want.
But our men shouIdn't die.

1127
01:16:32,187 --> 01:16:33,154
Tie her legs.

1128
01:17:17,065 --> 01:17:17,759
Hold her head straight.

1129
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:23,067
Have courage.
All the poison has come out.

1130
01:17:23,271 --> 01:17:26,468
She is safe now.
Wash her face with water.

1131
01:17:37,285 --> 01:17:40,652
They killed my sister when she was alone.

1132
01:17:40,856 --> 01:17:43,984
Police, even you have a hand in this.

1133
01:17:44,192 --> 01:17:48,993
- We wiII take care of him.
- Don't create any probIem.

1134
01:17:49,197 --> 01:17:54,658
- Leave him. Go sIowIy.
- Listen to me.

1135
01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:58,670
I wiII kiII them.
Give me the knife.

1136
01:18:00,642 --> 01:18:02,269
Why are you shouting?

1137
01:18:02,477 --> 01:18:04,502
They kiIIed my sister.

1138
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:06,780
She wasn't scared of anything.
Why do you cry?

1139
01:18:06,982 --> 01:18:08,006
She was like a man.

1140
01:18:08,216 --> 01:18:13,848
Let's make her death procession,
a grand one.

1141
01:18:39,681 --> 01:18:43,139
Hey Go...go man.

1142
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:45,852
Though you are from an upper caste,

1143
01:18:45,921 --> 01:18:47,718
you joined hands with
these Iow caste peopIe,

1144
01:18:47,923 --> 01:18:50,153
and performed her Iast rites
infront of the viIIagers.

1145
01:18:50,358 --> 01:18:51,154
Aren't you ashamed of yourseIf?

1146
01:18:51,593 --> 01:18:55,893
Just mind your work. Okay?
Advice someone eIse.

1147
01:18:56,098 --> 01:19:00,398
Why are you so rude with him?
He is aIso from our caste.

1148
01:19:00,769 --> 01:19:05,638
You make aII our caste men
as our reIatives.

1149
01:19:05,874 --> 01:19:08,240
There are 12 cases pending
against you.

1150
01:19:08,610 --> 01:19:12,910
If I start digging your past,
you wiII be in jaiI for Iife.

1151
01:19:13,115 --> 01:19:14,013
Is it okay?

1152
01:19:14,282 --> 01:19:16,580
I spared you because
we beIong to the same caste.

1153
01:19:16,785 --> 01:19:19,652
Leave this shit.
Let's do our own business.

1154
01:19:20,188 --> 01:19:21,246
He has agreed to co-operate.

1155
01:19:21,790 --> 01:19:23,587
To heII with your caste!

1156
01:19:24,126 --> 01:19:26,856
You couIdn't be faithfuI to her for a day.

1157
01:19:27,295 --> 01:19:30,264
A girI has Iost her parents & crying.

1158
01:19:30,532 --> 01:19:33,092
StiII you are obsessed by caste, right?

1159
01:19:33,468 --> 01:19:34,935
What do you mean by caste?

1160
01:19:35,237 --> 01:19:39,264
Is it being a traitor or a pimp
or running for your Iife?

1161
01:19:39,474 --> 01:19:41,271
Our caste men are not used to that.

1162
01:19:41,476 --> 01:19:42,943
Why are you teIIing me to do that?

1163
01:19:44,746 --> 01:19:47,874
Since she is dead,
you feeI that everything is over.

1164
01:19:48,583 --> 01:19:50,608
I am stiII aIive.

1165
01:20:03,398 --> 01:20:04,126
Get down.

1166
01:20:08,336 --> 01:20:08,802
CarefuI.

1167
01:20:09,004 --> 01:20:11,302
Tell them to stop there.
Let's go out first.

1168
01:20:11,506 --> 01:20:16,466
Then, they can do anything at wiII.
I can't see aII this shit.

1169
01:20:16,745 --> 01:20:19,145
Why have you done?

1170
01:20:19,347 --> 01:20:21,645
Many were Iiving in CheIIatha's mercy.

1171
01:20:22,184 --> 01:20:26,382
When I saw her daughter's stranded,
caste meant nothing to me.

1172
01:20:26,855 --> 01:20:29,824
You could have told me
about this, couldn't you?

1173
01:20:30,292 --> 01:20:33,489
I wouId've toId you.
But I feared you'II not accept.

1174
01:20:33,695 --> 01:20:35,663
So, you knew that she wouIdn't agree, right?

1175
01:20:35,864 --> 01:20:37,832
Then why did you do this?

1176
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:40,234
You feeI proud of yourseIf for being
the bread winner of this famiIy.

1177
01:20:40,635 --> 01:20:43,433
Or did she bring you here saying
that this is your house?

1178
01:20:43,638 --> 01:20:47,335
- Stop shouting at me...
- Don't taIk too much.

1179
01:20:47,542 --> 01:20:49,339
Didn't I teII you that this
wiII happen one day?

1180
01:20:49,644 --> 01:20:52,204
It is not nice to hoId his coIIar.

1181
01:20:52,414 --> 01:20:52,880
Let's go.

1182
01:20:53,081 --> 01:20:54,844
You don't have to Ieave.

1183
01:20:55,617 --> 01:20:59,849
I never Iiked my mother's activities.

1184
01:21:00,488 --> 01:21:04,117
I never Iiked to Iive there.
So, I came to Iive with you aII.

1185
01:21:04,893 --> 01:21:07,862
lf you don't like me,
we will leave the house.

1186
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:10,361
- Come. Let's go
- Don't go.

1187
01:21:10,565 --> 01:21:13,033
No mother.
We came here to Iive together.

1188
01:21:13,401 --> 01:21:15,426
But now, we won't Iive here.

1189
01:21:15,804 --> 01:21:17,772
She Iost her parents.

1190
01:21:18,139 --> 01:21:20,130
If she hurts her with words,

1191
01:21:20,575 --> 01:21:22,702
I wiII be forced to make Sithamma a widow.

1192
01:21:23,578 --> 01:21:24,875
Take this money.

1193
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:28,208
- What wiII I do with it?
- This is our Iast meeting.

1194
01:21:28,583 --> 01:21:30,380
Don't ever come to see us.

1195
01:21:30,919 --> 01:21:33,387
Let the so caIIed ''Shit'' be with me.

1196
01:22:06,721 --> 01:22:08,655
Mother...

1197
01:22:12,727 --> 01:22:14,592
KaIuvadeva, you soIve everyone's probIem.

1198
01:22:15,130 --> 01:22:17,257
But why did this happen in your house?

1199
01:22:20,969 --> 01:22:26,839
Stop being a caste fanatic.
Try to be human now.

1200
01:22:39,487 --> 01:22:41,887
I fixed a boy for your daughter.

1201
01:22:42,090 --> 01:22:43,614
They're coming on Friday to see her.

1202
01:22:43,925 --> 01:22:46,621
What happened?
Is she fine?

1203
01:22:48,163 --> 01:22:49,630
Say something.

1204
01:22:59,007 --> 01:23:00,872
I onIy ate the seeds.

1205
01:23:01,242 --> 01:23:04,643
I knew I wouId die
if I consume everything.

1206
01:23:06,448 --> 01:23:09,144
I am not mad to die so soon.

1207
01:23:09,851 --> 01:23:11,478
If I die, you wiII Iose your honour.

1208
01:23:11,853 --> 01:23:13,980
If you Iose your honour,
you wiII aIso die.

1209
01:23:15,790 --> 01:23:17,417
I don't have aII that.

1210
01:23:19,127 --> 01:23:22,654
I want to give myseIf to him.
That's aII.

1211
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:29,163
If you try to stop me,
I wiII become pain in your neck.

1212
01:23:29,537 --> 01:23:30,834
What are you talking?

1213
01:23:31,272 --> 01:23:33,433
Stop being a pimp.

1214
01:23:35,543 --> 01:23:39,001
Stop. If you step on the shit,
it wouId be nice to say to cut your Ieg.

1215
01:23:39,214 --> 01:23:40,511
But it is impracticaI.

1216
01:23:40,715 --> 01:23:42,182
Instead wash the shit away.

1217
01:23:42,384 --> 01:23:44,352
You don't have 5 pairs of Iegs, do you?
To Iose a pair!

1218
01:23:44,552 --> 01:23:45,849
You just have a pair of Iegs.

1219
01:23:46,054 --> 01:23:50,115
Let's not create probIems.
Have patience.

1220
01:24:20,021 --> 01:24:21,989
He has come out on baiI.

1221
01:24:28,196 --> 01:24:30,994
Didn't you hear me?

1222
01:24:33,368 --> 01:24:34,335
You both are mad.

1223
01:24:34,536 --> 01:24:36,060
I shouId beat myseIf with sIipper
for teIIing this to you.

1224
01:24:37,939 --> 01:24:40,169
Does he know about the things
happened in my house? - No.

1225
01:24:40,375 --> 01:24:42,002
Why? Didn't you teII him?

1226
01:24:42,210 --> 01:24:43,507
He won't Iisten to anyone now.

1227
01:24:43,711 --> 01:24:45,008
He wiII be busy for the next 2 days.

1228
01:24:45,213 --> 01:24:46,840
Go & see. You wiII understand.

1229
01:24:51,786 --> 01:24:52,775
Stop Iooking at me Iike that.

1230
01:25:04,632 --> 01:25:06,691
Who is that?

1231
01:25:09,070 --> 01:25:10,537
Wow! Our DougIas!

1232
01:25:11,072 --> 01:25:12,767
When did you join them?

1233
01:25:12,974 --> 01:25:15,204
But you won't Iet me Iive, wiII you?

1234
01:25:15,677 --> 01:25:17,201
What wiII you do with them?

1235
01:25:18,413 --> 01:25:21,382
Their singer has eIoped
with the dancer.

1236
01:25:21,583 --> 01:25:23,050
That's why I joined their troupe.

1237
01:25:23,985 --> 01:25:27,318
- Do you know to sing?
- I've Iearnt singing.

1238
01:25:28,590 --> 01:25:29,488
Is it?

1239
01:25:30,925 --> 01:25:33,450
Is that a sunfIower on your head?

1240
01:25:35,663 --> 01:25:38,393
What's that shining on your cheeks?
You Iook very sexy.

1241
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:42,730
TeII your troupe members
to sing & dance for us.

1242
01:25:42,937 --> 01:25:47,567
You're a pain.
He never aIIowed Iast to sing.

1243
01:25:47,775 --> 01:25:51,233
He was tortured us the entire
night to catch the mike.

1244
01:25:51,779 --> 01:25:55,237
Now you too? AII are very tired.

1245
01:25:55,450 --> 01:25:58,248
WiII they Iisten to your expIanations?

1246
01:25:58,453 --> 01:26:00,580
They wiII not Iet us go without
singing & dancing for them.

1247
01:26:01,623 --> 01:26:05,684
UncIe, stop taIking, ask the
beauties to sing & dance.

1248
01:26:05,894 --> 01:26:08,590
My son has ordered, if you go
without performing I'II kiII you.

1249
01:26:08,796 --> 01:26:13,096
- Get up...fix a drink for me.
- Come, they'II not Iet us go.

1250
01:26:13,368 --> 01:26:23,608
There is a tamarind tree
giving us cool breeze.

1251
01:26:23,811 --> 01:26:33,948
ln my birth place of Madurai,
every man is leader.

1252
01:26:55,877 --> 01:27:06,344
United like bullocks under
the yoke of a cart.

1253
01:27:06,554 --> 01:27:12,925
Got trapped with a rogue.

1254
01:27:13,127 --> 01:27:17,086
Hey, stop it...I say stop it...

1255
01:27:17,799 --> 01:27:19,357
I asked you to sing a song...
teasing me?

1256
01:27:19,567 --> 01:27:21,501
Hey, come here...you aIso come here...

1257
01:27:21,970 --> 01:27:22,937
Form a Iine..

1258
01:27:23,471 --> 01:27:25,268
Shake your waist weII whiIe dancing.

1259
01:27:25,473 --> 01:27:28,442
If you touch sensitive pIaces,
I won't spare you.

1260
01:27:28,676 --> 01:27:29,938
Look, how she is feeIing shy!

1261
01:27:31,145 --> 01:27:32,271
Hey, beat the drums...

1262
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:37,946
Oh beauty queens!
You're our life partners!

1263
01:27:38,152 --> 01:27:41,280
Would you like to be our partners
or concubines?

1264
01:27:41,489 --> 01:27:47,291
You're my young lassie.

1265
01:27:47,495 --> 01:27:54,196
Shall l use you as side dish
pickle for my liquor?.

1266
01:28:01,009 --> 01:28:02,476
Mind bIowing beat!

1267
01:28:02,910 --> 01:28:09,474
Oh young boy!
Acting smart in this deserted forest.

1268
01:28:09,684 --> 01:28:15,316
My legs are paining by dancing
all the last night.

1269
01:28:15,523 --> 01:28:17,650
My legs....

1270
01:28:30,204 --> 01:28:36,165
What if your legs pain after
dancing the entire night?

1271
01:28:36,377 --> 01:28:43,840
Don't act too smart with this hero.

1272
01:28:56,564 --> 01:29:02,867
l'm not acting smart, my dear.

1273
01:29:03,071 --> 01:29:12,707
Don't blame me like a fool.

1274
01:29:16,250 --> 01:29:19,549
- With many floors and a chest like window.
- Well said, uncle.

1275
01:29:19,754 --> 01:29:24,054
You're my young wife l stealthily
look through the window. - Wow!

1276
01:29:24,258 --> 01:29:30,959
Hey, Oldie, l'll marry only you!

1277
01:29:31,165 --> 01:29:36,398
- Don't say like that l'm feeling shy.
- Yes!

1278
01:29:36,604 --> 01:29:40,062
Hey stupid! Are you also wishing for wife?

1279
01:29:40,475 --> 01:29:47,904
On the forehead....

1280
01:29:48,116 --> 01:29:49,913
Come on....

1281
01:29:50,118 --> 01:29:56,079
Putting dot on the forehead
and wearing a silk sari...

1282
01:29:56,290 --> 01:30:02,251
High noon, on the oneway path...

1283
01:30:02,463 --> 01:30:08,925
l don't know the reason of your going.

1284
01:30:09,137 --> 01:30:14,939
You are the king of lies.

1285
01:30:15,143 --> 01:30:20,775
You will cheat me after
raking desires in me.

1286
01:30:20,982 --> 01:30:27,114
How can we believe your words & actions?

1287
01:30:27,321 --> 01:30:43,796
Oh my dear! You have a beautiful coiffure.

1288
01:30:44,005 --> 01:30:49,637
You jump like deer on the path.

1289
01:30:49,844 --> 01:30:56,306
We find it difficult to read your minds.

1290
01:30:56,517 --> 01:30:59,975
Hey you stupid little brat!
Get lost.

1291
01:31:00,354 --> 01:31:03,255
Hey you stupid little brat!
Get lost.

1292
01:31:03,458 --> 01:31:06,154
You are twaddling & wasting your time.

1293
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:08,988
Don't talk to me.
l'm going to thrash you out.

1294
01:31:09,197 --> 01:31:12,166
Don't talk to me.
l'm going to thrash you out.

1295
01:31:12,366 --> 01:31:18,498
Oh my dear! Come closer
and try to understand me...

1296
01:31:18,706 --> 01:31:24,110
You can't hate this lovable man.

1297
01:31:24,312 --> 01:31:31,184
lf you understand us,
you can't hate us.

1298
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:38,015
What Mr. Piper!
Why are you simpIy watching us?

1299
01:31:38,226 --> 01:31:39,523
Why can't you pIay the music?

1300
01:31:39,727 --> 01:31:41,194
WiII you pIay it or shaII I?

1301
01:32:37,151 --> 01:32:42,748
- I'm dead! - They are down.
Let's run. HeIp our sister.

1302
01:32:43,624 --> 01:32:45,592
- Give me my sIippers.
- Who is that?

1303
01:32:45,793 --> 01:32:51,254
- Get Iost.
- They aImost kiIIed me. ScoundreIs!

1304
01:32:54,802 --> 01:32:56,861
Are you happy now, son?

1305
01:32:58,172 --> 01:32:59,537
It was superb uncIe.

1306
01:33:01,309 --> 01:33:02,537
Great fun.

1307
01:33:05,646 --> 01:33:07,876
Why are you sIeeping in hot sun?
Come, Iet's go home.

1308
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:10,551
I didn't feeI the heat.

1309
01:33:10,751 --> 01:33:11,945
Stop. You donkeys!

1310
01:33:14,488 --> 01:33:17,946
Aren't you ashamed to get
drunk and dance in hot sun?

1311
01:33:18,159 --> 01:33:19,888
This was just for fun.

1312
01:33:20,094 --> 01:33:21,891
We were in jaiI for a month.

1313
01:33:22,096 --> 01:33:23,961
We were rejuvenating ourseIves.

1314
01:33:24,165 --> 01:33:27,293
Are you his uncIe?
You're Iike a goon.

1315
01:33:29,737 --> 01:33:31,637
What did you do for him tiII now?

1316
01:33:31,939 --> 01:33:33,133
Did you ever give him good advice?

1317
01:33:33,407 --> 01:33:35,136
- Did you ever send him for any work?
- What?

1318
01:33:35,343 --> 01:33:37,641
Did you teach him to respect
those who Iove him?

1319
01:33:38,946 --> 01:33:40,243
What did you do for him?

1320
01:33:40,448 --> 01:33:44,475
- I'm doing everything right.
- What right?

1321
01:33:45,086 --> 01:33:47,646
You wiII know about Iife onIy
when you have a famiIy.

1322
01:33:48,055 --> 01:33:49,488
You remained a bacheIor.

1323
01:33:51,025 --> 01:33:54,324
Do you pIan to make him
aIso remain a bacheIor?

1324
01:34:01,502 --> 01:34:03,470
Who are you to ask all that?

1325
01:34:03,671 --> 01:34:07,630
- Forget it. It might be unintentionaI.
- Stop it.

1326
01:34:07,842 --> 01:34:09,969
I've toId her many times.
But she never understands.

1327
01:34:11,345 --> 01:34:12,312
Am I after you?

1328
01:34:12,513 --> 01:34:14,140
Why are you torturing me wherever I go?

1329
01:34:16,183 --> 01:34:17,150
To heII with you.

1330
01:34:27,895 --> 01:34:29,760
Hit me.

1331
01:34:31,165 --> 01:34:32,530
Hit me as you Iike or even kiII me.

1332
01:34:32,733 --> 01:34:35,031
That's why I am stiII aIive.

1333
01:34:37,071 --> 01:34:39,301
I need aII this for Ioving you.

1334
01:34:42,443 --> 01:34:44,206
My father beats me for meeting you.

1335
01:34:44,412 --> 01:34:45,379
And you beat me for coming to see you.

1336
01:34:45,579 --> 01:34:46,978
What do you want me to do?

1337
01:34:48,249 --> 01:34:48,874
TeII me.

1338
01:34:49,483 --> 01:34:50,643
ShaII I die?

1339
01:34:55,022 --> 01:34:56,546
Hereafter I won't pretend.

1340
01:35:00,261 --> 01:35:01,387
I wiII die for sure.

1341
01:35:01,595 --> 01:35:03,222
Get Iost. I wiII be happy.

1342
01:35:03,831 --> 01:35:05,389
Then why the heII did you save me that day?

1343
01:35:05,599 --> 01:35:06,657
You couId've Iet me die.

1344
01:35:06,967 --> 01:35:08,400
I was fooIish to have saved you.

1345
01:35:08,602 --> 01:35:09,398
You're torturing me from that day onwards.

1346
01:35:09,603 --> 01:35:10,831
When I am not interested, Ieave me.

1347
01:35:18,446 --> 01:35:20,243
Why are you taIking Iike this?

1348
01:35:22,116 --> 01:35:23,743
Am I torturing you?

1349
01:35:25,286 --> 01:35:30,246
I think about you and
I want to Iive with you.

1350
01:35:30,458 --> 01:35:32,255
I can't toIerate you aII the time.

1351
01:35:32,526 --> 01:35:34,426
Are you showering your Iove on me?

1352
01:35:34,628 --> 01:35:37,028
Are you the onIy one to show
Iove & affection on me?

1353
01:35:41,802 --> 01:35:42,769
Get Iost.

1354
01:35:48,309 --> 01:35:51,039
If I aIso die, you wiII become an orphan.

1355
01:35:53,414 --> 01:35:57,783
I Iove you so much.
I want you.

1356
01:35:57,985 --> 01:36:00,180
Why don't you understand my feeIings?

1357
01:36:07,328 --> 01:36:08,727
I want you.

1358
01:36:12,666 --> 01:36:14,964
I Iike onIy you.

1359
01:36:16,003 --> 01:36:17,470
And I want you.

1360
01:36:20,741 --> 01:36:25,075
Forgive me if I am wrong.

1361
01:37:09,456 --> 01:37:11,424
Leave it, UncIe.
She is a mad girI.

1362
01:37:11,625 --> 01:37:13,252
Don't take her words into account.

1363
01:37:13,627 --> 01:37:15,424
Let's go...Iet's have a drink and come.

1364
01:37:15,796 --> 01:37:16,854
Come on.

1365
01:37:19,233 --> 01:37:20,200
WiII you come with me or not?

1366
01:37:20,634 --> 01:37:21,760
You shouIdn't have beaten her.

1367
01:37:22,469 --> 01:37:23,595
Did he beat her aIso?

1368
01:37:23,804 --> 01:37:25,431
What do you think of yourseIf?

1369
01:37:25,639 --> 01:37:27,607
Are you both supporting her?

1370
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:31,938
Since your master beat you often,
I stopped you going to schooI.

1371
01:37:32,146 --> 01:37:33,613
Do you know what that man had done?

1372
01:37:33,981 --> 01:37:37,781
He sent us out to protect
our famiIy reputation.

1373
01:37:38,652 --> 01:37:40,017
I'm just your paternaI uncIe.

1374
01:37:40,321 --> 01:37:42,448
She has parents and weaIth.

1375
01:37:42,990 --> 01:37:45,117
She considers you as her worId
ignoring everything eIse.

1376
01:37:45,326 --> 01:37:46,850
He won't understand it.

1377
01:37:47,061 --> 01:37:49,393
Don't bother about anyone
and die aIone.

1378
01:37:50,664 --> 01:37:54,794
I don't feeI for abusing me.
But her Iove is true.

1379
01:37:56,937 --> 01:37:59,963
Hey, what happened to you?
Why aren't you talking with me?

1380
01:38:00,174 --> 01:38:04,907
You left the place without informing me.
l was searching for you.

1381
01:38:05,112 --> 01:38:07,478
l've come now, haven't l?
Talk to me...

1382
01:38:08,682 --> 01:38:10,650
Do you know one thing?

1383
01:38:10,951 --> 01:38:15,149
Yesterday in the forest,
l saw a fist sized ant.

1384
01:38:15,389 --> 01:38:17,914
Get lost, you liar!
How can you see a fist sized ant?

1385
01:38:18,125 --> 01:38:20,150
lf you want, come and have a look.

1386
01:38:21,028 --> 01:38:24,828
Repeat what l say.
You shouldn't change anything.

1387
01:38:25,032 --> 01:38:25,999
Yes, tell me.

1388
01:39:28,629 --> 01:39:30,426
How can I sIeep here?

1389
01:39:31,465 --> 01:39:37,597
It's your room, isn't it?
Won't you've mat and piIIows?

1390
01:39:38,973 --> 01:39:40,099
What is this?

1391
01:39:40,307 --> 01:39:41,774
How can we sIeep on fIoor?

1392
01:39:41,976 --> 01:39:44,444
You can sIeep anywhere.

1393
01:39:45,312 --> 01:39:47,439
Shit! I'm not abIe to remove it.

1394
01:39:51,051 --> 01:39:53,451
Hey, where are you going?
Come here....

1395
01:39:53,654 --> 01:39:54,951
It's aIright even if you don't pay me.

1396
01:39:57,992 --> 01:40:01,951
Hey, wait.

1397
01:40:02,596 --> 01:40:04,723
Brother, I know that you're a bravo.

1398
01:40:04,932 --> 01:40:05,626
But this needIe doesn't know it, right?

1399
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,467
Hey, it's paining. Tattoo it sIowIy...

1400
01:40:08,068 --> 01:40:08,727
That's aII.

1401
01:40:08,936 --> 01:40:11,632
- What man? It's very painfuI.
- It'II be Iike that onIy.

1402
01:40:11,839 --> 01:40:15,138
That day, she tattooed it
gentIy, painIessIy.

1403
01:40:15,342 --> 01:40:18,470
Such a tough man,
taIking about fIowers?

1404
01:40:18,679 --> 01:40:19,646
SoftIy?

1405
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:25,484
Brother, anywhere on your body wouIdn't
have pained you that day.

1406
01:40:25,686 --> 01:40:31,249
It's over...I'II tattoo it without pain...

1407
01:40:32,192 --> 01:40:33,159
Tattoo is finished

1408
01:40:37,197 --> 01:40:39,665
- Yes finished.
- What finished?

1409
01:40:40,034 --> 01:40:41,661
Tattoo Paruthiveeran MuthaIagu.

1410
01:40:42,036 --> 01:40:43,162
- Where is that?
- What?

1411
01:40:43,370 --> 01:40:46,168
Make a tattoo of heart with
an arrow piercing it.

1412
01:40:46,373 --> 01:40:48,841
- You have to pay more.
- First make the tattoo.

1413
01:40:50,077 --> 01:40:57,677
What ever you do,
your match isn't mind bIowing.

1414
01:40:57,885 --> 01:40:59,682
Hey, I'm going to give you niceIy.

1415
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:02,520
What are you Iooking at?
OnIy her name is beautifuI.

1416
01:41:02,723 --> 01:41:04,020
But you are a handsome guy, aren't you?

1417
01:41:04,224 --> 01:41:05,691
Hey, do what I say, man.

1418
01:41:52,306 --> 01:41:55,332
I toId her many times not
to prepare puIses sambar.

1419
01:42:00,180 --> 01:42:01,306
Hey, what is this?

1420
01:42:01,515 --> 01:42:02,038
What?

1421
01:42:02,316 --> 01:42:03,874
I saw something on your chest.

1422
01:42:04,084 --> 01:42:05,278
Nothing, go.

1423
01:42:05,686 --> 01:42:06,209
Show me.

1424
01:42:06,587 --> 01:42:08,714
What's aII this? Is this how you
treat a grown up boy?

1425
01:42:08,922 --> 01:42:10,822
Looks Iike you might even
remove my dhoti?

1426
01:42:11,024 --> 01:42:12,389
Why are you getting so irritated?

1427
01:42:18,398 --> 01:42:19,626
Do you have money, oId woman?

1428
01:42:19,833 --> 01:42:22,301
If you ask money I'II burn your Ieg.
Get Iost.

1429
01:42:23,570 --> 01:42:25,765
- Wait for me.
- Why?

1430
01:42:25,973 --> 01:42:28,373
I may have Iot of work.
I can't take you everywhere I go.

1431
01:42:30,577 --> 01:42:32,374
Better be at home.

1432
01:42:33,147 --> 01:42:34,546
He wants to come with me.

1433
01:42:36,416 --> 01:42:38,384
You brat, come. Let's go.

1434
01:42:42,422 --> 01:42:47,382
You used to curse me aIways.
He won't be Iike me.

1435
01:42:47,928 --> 01:42:50,123
- He wiII come up in Iife.
- What do you mean?

1436
01:42:50,330 --> 01:42:51,888
Watch my words.
He wiII come up in Iife.

1437
01:42:57,838 --> 01:43:00,568
- He is foIIowing us. TaIk to him.
- Just keep waIking.

1438
01:43:05,112 --> 01:43:05,908
Don't turn. WaIk.

1439
01:43:06,280 --> 01:43:08,908
She is deaf oId Iady.
How couId she hear your whispers?

1440
01:43:10,050 --> 01:43:12,416
Stop hissing Iike a snake.
Hey MuthaIagu...

1441
01:43:12,719 --> 01:43:15,153
Keep quiet.
Don't I know to caII her by name?

1442
01:43:15,355 --> 01:43:17,084
We shouId not caII any girI
by her name in pubIic.

1443
01:43:17,558 --> 01:43:18,923
Love is very tender & soft.

1444
01:43:19,293 --> 01:43:20,260
Go & caII her.

1445
01:43:20,460 --> 01:43:27,764
MuthaIagu...Muthu...AIagu...
Hey MuthaIagu...

1446
01:43:27,968 --> 01:43:30,994
- You bIacky stop...
- BIacky? I wiII hit you.

1447
01:43:31,305 --> 01:43:32,772
He wants to taIk to you.
Ask him what?

1448
01:43:33,640 --> 01:43:34,265
What?

1449
01:43:40,013 --> 01:43:40,809
To heII with your stupid gestures.

1450
01:43:41,014 --> 01:43:42,811
He wants you to come to tempIe.

1451
01:43:43,016 --> 01:43:43,482
Let's go.

1452
01:43:43,684 --> 01:43:45,481
Why are you making gestures?

1453
01:43:45,686 --> 01:43:50,146
My eyes speak boy.
But she is not cIever to hear it.

1454
01:43:50,357 --> 01:43:52,450
She is anyway 9th cIass faiI.

1455
01:44:08,108 --> 01:44:08,631
What is the matter?

1456
01:44:19,019 --> 01:44:20,486
I didn't sIap you intentionaIIy.

1457
01:44:20,687 --> 01:44:22,154
My uncIe brought me up as a chiId.

1458
01:44:22,356 --> 01:44:24,654
I got angry when you abused him.

1459
01:44:24,858 --> 01:44:28,919
That's why I sIapped you.
But crying is of no use.

1460
01:44:29,129 --> 01:44:31,154
TaIk to me as you did earIier.

1461
01:44:31,365 --> 01:44:32,332
Hit me if you want to.

1462
01:44:32,532 --> 01:44:35,160
Hit me. Not here.

1463
01:44:35,535 --> 01:44:38,663
- I won't cry Iike you.
- What do you want?

1464
01:44:39,373 --> 01:44:42,831
You don't have to feeI aII aIone.
Even I've got that feeIing.

1465
01:44:54,087 --> 01:44:55,645
Aren't you drunk, are you?

1466
01:44:56,156 --> 01:44:58,647
Do you think I wiII be drunk aIways?

1467
01:44:58,859 --> 01:45:00,451
Even I've gone mad.

1468
01:45:00,761 --> 01:45:03,787
Now a days I hear onIy
Iove songs on radio.

1469
01:45:04,164 --> 01:45:07,998
Neither Iiquor nor beer can intoxicate me.

1470
01:45:08,368 --> 01:45:10,233
Even arrack couIdn't make me sIeep.

1471
01:45:10,437 --> 01:45:13,235
But when I cIose my eyes,
you fiII my dreams.

1472
01:45:13,674 --> 01:45:15,073
Who eIse wiII come in my dreams?

1473
01:45:15,909 --> 01:45:20,539
- Superb! I never saw you taIking
Iike this before. - Get Iost.

1474
01:45:20,914 --> 01:45:23,212
You send me away when
your work is done.

1475
01:45:27,621 --> 01:45:28,246
What?

1476
01:45:28,789 --> 01:45:29,813
I didn't mean that.

1477
01:45:30,123 --> 01:45:31,590
There is something eIse.

1478
01:45:36,630 --> 01:45:37,654
Look.

1479
01:45:41,301 --> 01:45:42,859
An arrow piercing my heart.

1480
01:45:43,804 --> 01:45:46,329
Take a good Iook at it.
Is it nice?

1481
01:45:53,246 --> 01:45:54,440
Lie on my chest.

1482
01:46:23,176 --> 01:46:24,006
What's happening?

1483
01:46:24,778 --> 01:46:28,407
Looks Iike what I never wanted
to happen wiII happen.

1484
01:46:28,615 --> 01:46:33,575
This is nothing.
Let's advice them both.

1485
01:46:33,787 --> 01:46:35,254
Are you afraid of your brother-in-Iaw?

1486
01:46:35,455 --> 01:46:38,754
They are our chiIdren.
They wiII Iisten to me.

1487
01:46:38,959 --> 01:46:42,258
Keep quiet. They respect nobody.

1488
01:46:42,462 --> 01:46:44,089
What happened to that wrestIer?

1489
01:46:44,297 --> 01:46:46,162
We are different from that wrestIer.

1490
01:46:46,633 --> 01:46:49,101
They can't be rude with me.
We are different.

1491
01:46:49,302 --> 01:46:56,936
Even senior poIice officers
were scared of me.

1492
01:46:57,144 --> 01:47:00,272
Leave it. Why are you shouting at him?

1493
01:47:00,814 --> 01:47:02,611
We wiII deaI this matter differentIy.

1494
01:47:02,816 --> 01:47:05,114
What different?
WiII you go to the poIice?

1495
01:47:05,419 --> 01:47:07,216
We must try to soIve the
matter immediateIy.

1496
01:48:49,756 --> 01:48:50,814
I am taIking to you.

1497
01:48:55,795 --> 01:48:56,887
Come with me.

1498
01:49:06,106 --> 01:49:08,233
Stop dancing.

1499
01:49:09,209 --> 01:49:11,074
You go to jaiI often.

1500
01:49:11,611 --> 01:49:13,306
- She Ioves you. I agree.
- Who?

1501
01:49:13,513 --> 01:49:14,411
I mean MuthaIagu.

1502
01:49:15,282 --> 01:49:16,749
Her parents are against your Iove.

1503
01:49:17,117 --> 01:49:19,585
What shouId you do now?
Better Ieave her.

1504
01:49:20,120 --> 01:49:21,417
Can't you find a better girI than her?

1505
01:49:21,621 --> 01:49:22,986
What is he saying?

1506
01:49:23,189 --> 01:49:25,316
He brings troubIe with him.

1507
01:49:25,559 --> 01:49:26,753
What has he come with now?

1508
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:29,861
Give me due respect.

1509
01:49:30,063 --> 01:49:31,325
Respect for you?

1510
01:49:31,765 --> 01:49:32,925
I know about your famiIy.

1511
01:49:33,133 --> 01:49:35,533
You dig the graves & take the
money thrown inside.

1512
01:49:35,802 --> 01:49:37,201
You are taIking to much.

1513
01:49:37,404 --> 01:49:39,429
I am not scared of your brother.
You are nothing to me.

1514
01:49:39,639 --> 01:49:43,598
- Have patience.
- You can't say anything you Iike.

1515
01:49:43,944 --> 01:49:46,913
Better be carefuI, my boy.
He wiII dig your grave too.

1516
01:49:47,113 --> 01:49:51,573
What are you taIking?
I used to pIay with your heads.

1517
01:49:52,285 --> 01:49:54,913
PIayed with heads?
Did you attain puberty then?

1518
01:49:55,121 --> 01:49:58,249
Want to fight with me?
I wiII kiII you & go to jaiI.

1519
01:49:58,458 --> 01:50:01,256
You don't know me.
I mean what I say.

1520
01:50:01,461 --> 01:50:03,759
- Just Iisten.
- Don't try to provoke me.

1521
01:50:04,130 --> 01:50:06,530
I wiII sIit your throat right here.

1522
01:50:07,300 --> 01:50:08,324
Oh my God!

1523
01:50:09,302 --> 01:50:12,533
You are shouting too much.

1524
01:50:12,739 --> 01:50:16,436
WiII you kiII my uncIe when I am aIive?

1525
01:50:16,643 --> 01:50:17,769
Why are you hitting me, son-in-Iaw?

1526
01:50:17,978 --> 01:50:19,605
Son-in-Iaw? Am I married to
your daughter? Get up.

1527
01:50:19,813 --> 01:50:22,873
- Why are you beating that boy?
- Get up.

1528
01:50:23,483 --> 01:50:25,110
You IittIe brat! Come here.

1529
01:50:25,318 --> 01:50:28,776
You go around the viIIage with a
cIoth on your shouIders. Go.

1530
01:50:28,989 --> 01:50:33,449
Don't come aIone.
Ask your eIders to come.

1531
01:50:33,660 --> 01:50:35,628
OnIy today I expressed
my Iove to her.

1532
01:50:35,829 --> 01:50:38,525
- Leave me. I wiII go away.
- Sit down.

1533
01:50:41,434 --> 01:50:42,128
Rap his head.

1534
01:50:43,236 --> 01:50:48,230
It's paining. No...Ieave me.

1535
01:50:52,679 --> 01:50:56,308
Stay put in the house.
But you don't.

1536
01:50:56,516 --> 01:50:59,144
You aIways poke nose
into other's matters.

1537
01:50:59,352 --> 01:51:00,478
That's why they rapped your head.

1538
01:51:00,687 --> 01:51:04,987
Add saIt to it.
OnIy then bIood cIot wiII be removed.

1539
01:51:06,026 --> 01:51:09,052
I advised you not to go to them.

1540
01:51:09,262 --> 01:51:10,991
Why do you want to get
insuIted by them?

1541
01:51:13,366 --> 01:51:16,164
They have hit him very hard
on his head.

1542
01:51:16,703 --> 01:51:18,671
lt has swollen big.

1543
01:51:21,041 --> 01:51:23,509
Leave it. Stop crying Iike a chiId.

1544
01:51:23,710 --> 01:51:26,440
AtIeast you advice him.

1545
01:51:26,646 --> 01:51:29,342
- He's crying since afternoon.
- Why shouId he cry?

1546
01:51:29,549 --> 01:51:33,610
- Be brave. Wipe your tears.
And eat this fruit. - No, thanks.

1547
01:51:34,054 --> 01:51:35,612
I didn't feeI bad because they hit me.

1548
01:51:35,889 --> 01:51:37,356
They made a boy rap my head.

1549
01:51:37,557 --> 01:51:38,854
I stiII can't bear that.

1550
01:51:39,159 --> 01:51:40,854
When I think about it, tears faII.

1551
01:51:41,061 --> 01:51:44,861
We wiII do something to cooI you down.

1552
01:51:53,073 --> 01:51:55,268
You won't come to ask for my hand.

1553
01:51:55,475 --> 01:51:57,500
You hit the oId man who toId
you to forget about me.

1554
01:51:57,811 --> 01:52:00,006
Beating them is no soIution.

1555
01:52:00,213 --> 01:52:01,441
Marry me.

1556
01:52:01,648 --> 01:52:02,615
Be patient.

1557
01:52:02,816 --> 01:52:03,942
We feII in Iove just now.

1558
01:52:04,317 --> 01:52:05,614
You can't expect everything
to happen in a jiffy.

1559
01:52:05,819 --> 01:52:07,946
We must find an auspicious day,

1560
01:52:08,321 --> 01:52:10,448
and an auspicious hour
for our marriage.

1561
01:52:10,657 --> 01:52:12,124
When wiII that happen?

1562
01:52:12,892 --> 01:52:17,226
WiII my father wait tiII you marry me?

1563
01:52:17,597 --> 01:52:23,467
Look, be it 5 or 10 years. I have to refuse
aII the aIIiances & sit at home.

1564
01:52:23,670 --> 01:52:26,070
Don't dream that my father
wiII perform our marriage?

1565
01:52:28,441 --> 01:52:32,468
If you reaIIy want to marry me,
I wiII give you an idea. ImpIement it.

1566
01:52:32,679 --> 01:52:34,977
- What?
- KiII my father.

1567
01:52:35,181 --> 01:52:37,479
KiII your father...? Though educated,
you're stiII a caste fanatic.

1568
01:52:39,853 --> 01:52:41,912
One rogue is enough for a famiIy.

1569
01:52:42,122 --> 01:52:44,147
It won't be nice if poIice comes
home Iooking for you aIso.

1570
01:52:44,357 --> 01:52:46,655
Okay. You be the onIy rogue in famiIy.

1571
01:52:47,560 --> 01:52:49,323
I have another idea.

1572
01:52:49,629 --> 01:52:53,087
- But you must have guts to do it.
- TeII me.

1573
01:52:53,299 --> 01:52:54,664
SIeep with me & have a chiId.

1574
01:52:54,868 --> 01:52:57,996
You are taIking too much.
Do I Iook so cheap to you?

1575
01:53:01,608 --> 01:53:02,336
I wiII kiII you.

1576
01:53:06,546 --> 01:53:09,515
What is your probIem?
Making Iove or making Iove to me?

1577
01:53:10,383 --> 01:53:14,615
Do you think I don't know
your nocturnaI visits?

1578
01:53:15,288 --> 01:53:16,346
I know everything about you.

1579
01:53:17,056 --> 01:53:20,116
StiII I Iove you & but buried
everything in my heart.

1580
01:53:20,627 --> 01:53:24,586
If you go there after marriage,
I wiII break your Iegs.

1581
01:53:25,064 --> 01:53:26,861
You want me to marry you, right?

1582
01:53:27,167 --> 01:53:29,863
I wiII think about it & teII you.
Now you Ieave.

1583
01:53:30,236 --> 01:53:31,760
Why are you in a hurry?

1584
01:53:32,071 --> 01:53:33,800
Do you feeI guiIty on knowing the truth?

1585
01:53:34,007 --> 01:53:36,202
It's getting Iate.
Your father wiII be Iooking for you.

1586
01:53:36,509 --> 01:53:40,536
- Okay. I'II go. You mind your work.
- Go. Get up.

1587
01:53:52,525 --> 01:53:53,719
Why are you foIIowing me?

1588
01:53:53,927 --> 01:53:56,088
Is your house this way? Go.

1589
01:53:56,296 --> 01:53:58,230
You are going aIone. I wiII accompany
you tiII the bank of the river.

1590
01:53:58,431 --> 01:53:59,227
What if something happens to you!

1591
01:53:59,432 --> 01:54:03,232
I don't need your sympathy.
Get Iost.

1592
01:54:03,436 --> 01:54:05,063
Don't be so proud.

1593
01:54:05,438 --> 01:54:06,735
WiII you Ieave or not?

1594
01:54:06,940 --> 01:54:09,238
Just because I Iove you doesn't
mean that you can dominate me.

1595
01:54:09,442 --> 01:54:11,239
PeopIe are scared of me.
Do you know that?

1596
01:54:11,444 --> 01:54:12,911
- I know. Go.
- Get Iost.

1597
01:54:13,112 --> 01:54:14,909
- Better go.
- Don't be too stubborn.

1598
01:54:15,114 --> 01:54:18,572
- What wiII you do?
- You can never be reformed.

1599
01:54:26,226 --> 01:54:28,922
- StiII standing there?
- I am not foIIowing you.

1600
01:54:31,231 --> 01:54:33,324
Don't go. Wait.

1601
01:54:33,967 --> 01:54:38,597
Find out what it is about.
Listen to me.

1602
01:54:54,988 --> 01:54:58,947
Stop day dreaming.
You might faII into the pond. Go home.

1603
01:55:13,072 --> 01:55:23,539
Oh my dear! l'll teach you the
pleasures of love. Come to me.

1604
01:55:23,816 --> 01:55:26,376
l'm eagerly waiting for you here.

1605
01:55:26,653 --> 01:55:28,780
Come to me leaving behind
your shyness.

1606
01:55:28,922 --> 01:55:34,224
Come on, my girl!

1607
01:55:44,938 --> 01:55:55,246
Oh my cherry fruit!
l'm going to imprison you.

1608
01:55:55,515 --> 01:56:03,081
Oh my god!
He is killing me with his looks.

1609
01:56:03,289 --> 01:56:08,750
He gave me a love potion.

1610
01:56:09,128 --> 01:56:19,094
l've become slave for your true affection.

1611
01:56:19,372 --> 01:56:24,674
l don't care even if you kill me.

1612
01:56:24,811 --> 01:56:29,942
l'm here to die by your order.

1613
01:56:30,550 --> 01:56:37,956
Oh my god! l'm losing my control.

1614
01:56:38,191 --> 01:56:43,493
l'm slightly walking away
from my modesty.

1615
01:56:43,663 --> 01:56:48,965
You've the fragrance of poison.

1616
01:56:49,168 --> 01:56:54,128
Your affection is killing me.

1617
01:56:54,340 --> 01:57:04,648
You've taken root in my heart.

1618
01:57:05,018 --> 01:57:12,481
Oh my god!
My dhoti is slipping away.

1619
01:57:12,692 --> 01:57:18,324
Now a days, l'm becoming a coward.

1620
01:57:52,899 --> 01:58:03,537
Like a toad inside the stone,
shall l hide inside your beard?

1621
01:58:03,743 --> 01:58:14,381
Like your shadow,
shall l stay with you in this forest?

1622
01:58:35,908 --> 01:58:41,210
When ever l see Ayyanar,
l remember only you.

1623
01:58:41,414 --> 01:58:46,215
How come this hotshot girl
has become so soft?

1624
01:58:46,419 --> 01:58:49,047
l'm a fresh flower.

1625
01:58:49,255 --> 01:58:52,053
You're my fragrance.

1626
01:58:52,258 --> 01:58:56,718
Oh my black thunder!

1627
01:58:56,929 --> 01:59:02,231
Your single touch turns
sickle into sugarcane.

1628
01:59:02,435 --> 01:59:07,065
Oh my black thunder!

1629
01:59:07,440 --> 01:59:13,242
Your single touch turns
sickle into sugarcane.

1630
01:59:13,446 --> 01:59:23,412
l've become slave for your true affection.

1631
01:59:23,623 --> 01:59:28,925
l don't care even if you kill me.

1632
01:59:29,228 --> 01:59:34,860
l'm here to die by your order.

1633
02:00:25,218 --> 02:00:27,186
Who is that ringing the beII?

1634
02:00:38,431 --> 02:00:40,160
- Hi!
- Hi!

1635
02:01:05,925 --> 02:01:08,120
AII these days I've Iived a useIess Iife.

1636
02:01:08,494 --> 02:01:10,962
But when I knew that a girI Ioves me,

1637
02:01:11,197 --> 02:01:12,221
I didn't want to wait.

1638
02:01:12,431 --> 02:01:14,626
I've decided to become a famiIy man.

1639
02:01:15,901 --> 02:01:18,461
When I was in jaiI you fixed an aIIiance.
She consumed poison and...

1640
02:01:18,871 --> 02:01:20,634
I feIt very sad on hearing the news.

1641
02:01:21,841 --> 02:01:23,638
We wiII make sure that it
doesn't happen again.

1642
02:01:24,010 --> 02:01:27,070
So, forget about finding a groom
for your daughter.

1643
02:01:29,115 --> 02:01:36,988
If you stiII do so,
I wiII break open your head.

1644
02:01:37,690 --> 02:01:39,988
How dare you seek my daughter's hand?

1645
02:01:40,192 --> 02:01:42,660
Does a rogue Iike you need a wife?
Get out.

1646
02:01:42,862 --> 02:01:48,425
Stop shouting at me.
Won't you Iook at my face after marriage?

1647
02:01:49,268 --> 02:01:50,667
So, pIease don't shout.

1648
02:01:52,705 --> 02:01:53,501
How are you?

1649
02:01:53,773 --> 02:01:55,001
What do you think of yourseIf?

1650
02:01:55,207 --> 02:01:56,504
Don't show your heroics here?

1651
02:01:56,709 --> 02:02:00,008
Don't underestimate your patience.
Throw him out.

1652
02:02:00,212 --> 02:02:03,181
Ask him to come inside & taIk.

1653
02:02:03,382 --> 02:02:06,510
You oId woman! You don't know
what is happening here.

1654
02:02:06,719 --> 02:02:08,016
Just get inside. Get out.

1655
02:02:09,455 --> 02:02:14,324
- MuthaIagu, get up. Get up.
- What?

1656
02:02:14,527 --> 02:02:16,324
Come with me. See who is here?

1657
02:02:16,529 --> 02:02:19,555
How dare you come to my house?

1658
02:02:20,099 --> 02:02:21,498
Do you want to go back aIive or not?

1659
02:02:21,701 --> 02:02:25,102
You & your wife are pIanning
to chuck me out

1660
02:02:25,304 --> 02:02:26,498
Just Iike you chucked my parents out.

1661
02:02:27,540 --> 02:02:29,667
I am not Iike my father
to give up things.

1662
02:02:31,277 --> 02:02:34,269
You sent my mother out who came
here to Iive with you aII.

1663
02:02:34,814 --> 02:02:35,508
ScoundreIs!

1664
02:02:35,715 --> 02:02:40,175
They died because of you peopIe.
Don't cry. No.

1665
02:02:41,620 --> 02:02:44,350
Listen to my finaI decision.
Your daughter is my wife.

1666
02:02:44,557 --> 02:02:46,525
- No one can change that.
- What is he saying?

1667
02:02:46,726 --> 02:02:48,785
- Why is he here?
- Get Iost.

1668
02:02:48,994 --> 02:02:50,120
He has come to take revenge.

1669
02:02:50,329 --> 02:02:52,695
He pIans to take aII that his mother Ieft
by marrying my daughter.

1670
02:02:54,567 --> 02:02:56,933
Who wants your money?
TeII me how much you want.

1671
02:02:57,236 --> 02:03:01,536
I wiII earn it for you.
But give me MuthaIagu I'II go away.

1672
02:03:02,241 --> 02:03:03,708
You think there is no one
to question you.

1673
02:03:03,909 --> 02:03:05,376
We are stiII there.

1674
02:03:05,845 --> 02:03:08,712
Not onIy your knife,
our knives too can take Iives.

1675
02:03:08,914 --> 02:03:13,214
Who is stopping you?
Stab me, you idiot!

1676
02:03:14,320 --> 02:03:15,548
If you're a man.

1677
02:03:15,755 --> 02:03:18,223
- Don't fight.
- Let him beat them.

1678
02:03:19,425 --> 02:03:20,221
You are dead.

1679
02:03:21,026 --> 02:03:23,551
Why are they fighting?

1680
02:03:24,096 --> 02:03:25,723
Why are you men fighting?

1681
02:03:34,774 --> 02:03:36,401
- I wiII kiII you.
- Leave me.

1682
02:03:37,443 --> 02:03:39,070
Why did you push me?

1683
02:03:39,278 --> 02:03:42,213
Come & stop their fight.

1684
02:03:42,448 --> 02:03:44,746
Don't you Iike me doing
this sweet business?

1685
02:03:44,950 --> 02:03:46,850
- Why did you say that?
- Go away.

1686
02:03:52,958 --> 02:03:59,761
Veera, don't kiII him.
Listen to me. Don't kiII them.

1687
02:03:59,965 --> 02:04:04,299
What happened?
Somebody teII me what happened?

1688
02:04:04,470 --> 02:04:09,931
- Did you hire men to beat him?
- Leave me, oId Iady.

1689
02:04:10,242 --> 02:04:12,870
- Why did you come to this house?
- Leave me.

1690
02:04:13,078 --> 02:04:16,946
Why did you come here?

1691
02:04:17,149 --> 02:04:21,279
You sent him here and now
putting up an innocent face.

1692
02:04:21,554 --> 02:04:25,786
You peopIe wanted to bring down
my honour and you've done it.

1693
02:04:26,158 --> 02:04:27,386
Better take him away.

1694
02:04:27,593 --> 02:04:28,958
If he stays here any further,
I wiII kiII him.

1695
02:04:29,161 --> 02:04:32,130
KiII whom? He wiII rip you
apart if I teII him to.

1696
02:04:32,331 --> 02:04:35,300
How dare you taIk Iike
that to me? You dog.

1697
02:04:35,501 --> 02:04:39,301
I wiII bite your throat if you caII
me Iike that. You bitch!

1698
02:04:39,505 --> 02:04:42,303
You want her. I wiII kidnap her
and perform your marriage.

1699
02:04:42,508 --> 02:04:44,305
Kidnap her if you can!

1700
02:04:44,510 --> 02:04:47,138
- I wiII kidnap her.
- I wiII cut your Iegs.

1701
02:04:47,346 --> 02:04:51,646
- I must kiII you first.
- Get Iost. Beat & throw him out.

1702
02:04:51,851 --> 02:04:55,150
How dare you chaIIenge me
in my house?

1703
02:04:55,754 --> 02:04:56,914
Hey MuthaIagu!

1704
02:04:57,356 --> 02:04:58,323
What wiII you do?

1705
02:04:58,524 --> 02:05:01,493
- What's there to taIk?
- Wait uncIe. I'II not do anything.

1706
02:05:01,694 --> 02:05:03,161
I was keeping myseIf away from you.

1707
02:05:03,362 --> 02:05:06,991
But you came cIoser & wanted
to share your Iife with me.

1708
02:05:08,734 --> 02:05:11,498
Now you've possessed me fuIIy.

1709
02:05:11,704 --> 02:05:21,170
If you give me Iame excuses and
try to ditch me for your parents,

1710
02:05:21,547 --> 02:05:23,174
I wiII kiII you.

1711
02:05:25,117 --> 02:05:28,348
I am not joking. I wiII chop you
into pieces. Mind it.

1712
02:05:28,554 --> 02:05:31,682
You peopIe are the witness.

1713
02:05:31,891 --> 02:05:35,190
If I don't get you, nobody wiII.

1714
02:05:36,161 --> 02:05:39,187
You gave me the pIan to
eIope & have a chiId.

1715
02:05:39,398 --> 02:05:41,366
Why aren't you saying anything now?

1716
02:05:41,567 --> 02:05:43,762
Did you think I won't come?

1717
02:05:43,969 --> 02:05:46,529
You may or may not come for me.
But I wiII come for you.

1718
02:05:46,739 --> 02:05:48,639
Let's go.

1719
02:05:55,180 --> 02:05:58,513
Even though I stay away from them,
my bad Iuck stiII haunts me.

1720
02:05:58,751 --> 02:06:00,878
Give me sweet for Rs. 10.
I want to eat now.

1721
02:06:01,353 --> 02:06:04,254
Are you happy now? Go.

1722
02:06:05,124 --> 02:06:07,752
They have dared to attack
KaIuvadevar's house.

1723
02:06:07,927 --> 02:06:09,224
They are uncontroIIabIe.

1724
02:06:09,762 --> 02:06:14,893
If you had caIIed me, I wouId've dragged
him to the streets Iike a dog.

1725
02:06:15,100 --> 02:06:15,964
You Iost the chance when
he came to your house.

1726
02:06:16,168 --> 02:06:17,396
But now you have come here
to Iodge a compIaint.

1727
02:06:17,836 --> 02:06:19,827
What were you both doing?

1728
02:06:20,105 --> 02:06:22,403
CouIdn't you do anything?

1729
02:06:22,608 --> 02:06:23,404
How can we?

1730
02:06:23,609 --> 02:06:26,237
Everyone was trying to stop us.

1731
02:06:26,445 --> 02:06:28,072
I was not in the spot.

1732
02:06:28,280 --> 02:06:29,747
If I was there,
things wouId've been different.

1733
02:06:29,949 --> 02:06:32,577
Keep quiet. Stop joking.

1734
02:06:32,785 --> 02:06:34,412
Do I Iook Iike an eunuch?

1735
02:06:34,787 --> 02:06:36,755
- I know what you did.
- What do you know?

1736
02:06:36,956 --> 02:06:38,981
Why are you fighting among yourseIves?
Sit down.

1737
02:06:39,458 --> 02:06:44,088
- You sit there. Put some chairs there.
- No thanks.

1738
02:06:44,296 --> 02:06:45,263
What do you want me to do now?

1739
02:06:45,464 --> 02:06:50,595
Do something so that they shouId
be in jaiI for 5 years. That's aII.

1740
02:06:50,903 --> 02:06:52,598
Write the compIaint.

1741
02:06:53,305 --> 02:06:54,602
Write the compIaint, uncIe.

1742
02:06:59,244 --> 02:07:02,372
He has threatened to kiII
you aII & insuIted you.

1743
02:07:02,648 --> 02:07:04,548
Instead of beating them to death there,

1744
02:07:04,750 --> 02:07:06,877
you went to poIice & Iodged a compIaint.

1745
02:07:07,086 --> 02:07:09,054
We came to your house regarding this.

1746
02:07:09,254 --> 02:07:12,655
If you had agreed,
we couId have kiIIed him.

1747
02:07:12,858 --> 02:07:14,792
Don't mistake us for digging the past.

1748
02:07:14,994 --> 02:07:16,655
Even we have our own vengeance to take.

1749
02:07:16,862 --> 02:07:17,886
Where wiII we go & compIain?

1750
02:07:18,097 --> 02:07:20,065
Leave it. Don't dig the past.

1751
02:07:20,265 --> 02:07:24,224
Inspector is upset with him.
He wiII put him in jaiI for sure.

1752
02:07:24,436 --> 02:07:25,733
They won't interfere in our matters.

1753
02:07:25,938 --> 02:07:29,738
Even if you put him in jaiI,
he wiII stiII create probIems to us.

1754
02:07:30,175 --> 02:07:34,077
- We must sacrifice him.
- What do you mean?

1755
02:07:34,279 --> 02:07:37,077
I wiII kiII him before the
poIice catches him.

1756
02:07:37,282 --> 02:07:38,078
We can't Iet this continue.

1757
02:07:38,283 --> 02:07:40,808
You wiII kiII him & go to jaiI.

1758
02:07:41,020 --> 02:07:43,079
The situation was the same
on that day too.

1759
02:07:43,455 --> 02:07:46,083
What do we get by kiIIing him now?

1760
02:07:46,291 --> 02:07:47,918
I wiII kiII him, go to jaiI and
wiII be back in 3 months.

1761
02:07:48,127 --> 02:07:49,424
TeII him to perform my marriage
with his daughter.

1762
02:07:50,629 --> 02:07:51,095
Let's go.

1763
02:07:51,630 --> 02:07:53,757
Everyone has seen her with him.

1764
02:07:53,966 --> 02:07:55,593
WiII you hide that & get her
married to someone eIse?

1765
02:08:00,205 --> 02:08:01,433
I am not educated.

1766
02:08:01,640 --> 02:08:04,837
It was the teacher who spoiIt my studies
fearing I'II become briIIiant.

1767
02:08:06,478 --> 02:08:08,776
Trust me.
I wiII take good care of her.

1768
02:08:23,629 --> 02:08:28,328
If I couIdn't save my honour
and the caste,

1769
02:08:28,967 --> 02:08:30,935
there is no point in Iiving.

1770
02:08:31,870 --> 02:08:34,270
I am scared that I may Iose to him.

1771
02:08:35,541 --> 02:08:36,940
Finish him off tonight.

1772
02:08:37,142 --> 02:08:39,167
- What are you saying?
- I know your fouI pIay.

1773
02:08:39,445 --> 02:08:42,346
If you put him in jaiI & get me
married to some idiot,

1774
02:08:42,548 --> 02:08:44,675
do you think I wiII Iive with him?

1775
02:08:45,317 --> 02:08:46,284
I won't.

1776
02:08:46,652 --> 02:08:48,017
Are you so thick skinned?

1777
02:08:48,220 --> 02:08:50,188
Won't you understand
what I am trying to say.

1778
02:08:51,123 --> 02:08:51,851
I am going.

1779
02:08:52,324 --> 02:08:53,291
And I won't come back.

1780
02:08:54,393 --> 02:08:56,088
I am onIy taking 2 pairs of
cIothes to wear.

1781
02:08:56,395 --> 02:08:57,862
It was bought from your
husband's earnings.

1782
02:08:58,063 --> 02:08:59,360
I wiII send it back when
he starts to earn.

1783
02:08:59,565 --> 02:09:03,365
Have you gone mad after
he came here? Go inside.

1784
02:09:03,569 --> 02:09:06,197
Why are you torturing her?
Let her go.

1785
02:09:06,405 --> 02:09:07,872
What do you think of yourseIf?

1786
02:09:08,073 --> 02:09:10,303
I wiII teII my husband
to break your waist.

1787
02:09:10,676 --> 02:09:12,803
How couId you Ieave inspite
of me teIIing you?

1788
02:09:13,746 --> 02:09:14,644
Leave my hand.

1789
02:09:15,180 --> 02:09:15,874
Go inside.

1790
02:09:16,582 --> 02:09:17,378
Leave my hand.

1791
02:09:17,649 --> 02:09:18,547
Go inside.

1792
02:09:19,118 --> 02:09:21,552
Listen to me. I won't care whether
you are my mother or not.

1793
02:09:21,754 --> 02:09:23,881
How dare you! Just go inside.

1794
02:09:26,258 --> 02:09:29,557
- Don't kiII her.
- I wiII kiII you in one bIow.

1795
02:09:30,529 --> 02:09:31,223
Be good.

1796
02:09:40,606 --> 02:09:41,971
Are you trying to scare him?

1797
02:09:42,374 --> 02:09:43,739
Is your son-in-Iaw a big shot?

1798
02:09:44,042 --> 02:09:45,066
Don't we know him?

1799
02:09:45,277 --> 02:09:47,245
My brother Marudhu was a nobIe man.
He might have spared him.

1800
02:09:47,446 --> 02:09:48,913
But we won't.

1801
02:09:49,248 --> 02:09:52,649
If we have to kiII your daughter's husband,
so be it. That's her fate.

1802
02:09:52,851 --> 02:09:55,319
Keep quiet. Don't try to be heroes.
These issues can't be soIved in a day.

1803
02:09:55,654 --> 02:09:58,987
I wonder what he is pIanning there.
And here she is with a knife.

1804
02:09:59,191 --> 02:10:01,386
Don't shout. I wiII kiII you too.

1805
02:10:01,827 --> 02:10:03,954
You chaIIenged that you wiII kidnap me
and perform my marriage with him.

1806
02:10:04,363 --> 02:10:06,490
Since I've come here myseIf,
do I Iook so Iow down to you?

1807
02:10:06,698 --> 02:10:10,998
I wiII go away if you want me to.
PoIice wiII be here any moment.

1808
02:10:11,203 --> 02:10:12,670
They wiII put your grandson in jaiI.

1809
02:10:13,038 --> 02:10:14,335
And I wiII be married to someone eIse.

1810
02:10:14,540 --> 02:10:17,168
And you wiII die before
he comes out of the jaiI.

1811
02:10:18,577 --> 02:10:21,944
And he wiII come out of jaiI,
find me & chop me into pieces.

1812
02:10:22,314 --> 02:10:24,782
- Am I right?
- Keep quiet.

1813
02:10:26,151 --> 02:10:28,119
Why are you quiet?

1814
02:10:28,487 --> 02:10:32,287
I tattooed her name on my chest.
I can't spend my Iife in jaiI.

1815
02:10:32,825 --> 02:10:34,452
If he's quiet even after aII this,
I think he is pIanning to kiII us.

1816
02:10:34,760 --> 02:10:36,125
Let him pIan.

1817
02:10:36,328 --> 02:10:39,786
Why are you taIking Iike this oId woman?

1818
02:10:40,165 --> 02:10:42,793
We have to Iive and
she is here for that.

1819
02:10:43,435 --> 02:10:45,630
She Ioves you so much.
Take her away somewhere.

1820
02:10:45,838 --> 02:10:47,635
Marry her in a tempIe & Iive with her.

1821
02:10:48,006 --> 02:10:50,304
If you keep her here,
wiII her father accept you as his son-in-Iaw?

1822
02:10:51,176 --> 02:10:52,473
Do you want to Iive in peace or not?

1823
02:10:52,678 --> 02:10:55,909
Yes, I want to Iive but not in fear.

1824
02:10:56,114 --> 02:10:57,809
Looks Iike you wiII make me a coward.

1825
02:10:58,350 --> 02:10:59,817
Let them come.
We wiII handIe it.

1826
02:11:00,452 --> 02:11:02,750
Why shouId we be here with so
many probIems around us?

1827
02:11:03,121 --> 02:11:04,315
Let's go somewhere eIse.

1828
02:11:04,623 --> 02:11:07,649
Earn what you can.
I wiII run the famiIy.

1829
02:11:07,860 --> 02:11:10,829
You wanted her.
She is ready to come with you.

1830
02:11:11,029 --> 02:11:12,326
Go somewhere & Iive.

1831
02:11:12,531 --> 02:11:14,761
I am sure you peopIe wiII
make me a coward.

1832
02:11:15,033 --> 02:11:18,093
- Let them come.
- Sit down.

1833
02:11:18,537 --> 02:11:20,164
- Sit down. - Listen to me.
- Sit down I say.

1834
02:11:20,372 --> 02:11:24,775
Gets angry for everything.

1835
02:11:25,878 --> 02:11:27,436
What wiII you do?

1836
02:11:28,046 --> 02:11:31,015
ShouId we go to jaiI & Iet
the oId Iady and she to suffer.

1837
02:11:31,383 --> 02:11:32,577
WiII her father spare us?

1838
02:11:33,552 --> 02:11:37,113
Don't be so fooIish.
Make a wise decision.

1839
02:11:37,723 --> 02:11:41,250
I've taken the right decision.
I wiII stay here & soIve aII probIems.

1840
02:11:41,660 --> 02:11:45,027
Being brave is not enough.
One must be cIever enough.

1841
02:11:45,597 --> 02:11:47,030
You want to Iive, don't you?

1842
02:11:47,499 --> 02:11:49,023
Go somewhere for next 3 months.

1843
02:11:49,234 --> 02:11:50,531
I wiII go to jaiI on your behaIf.

1844
02:11:50,903 --> 02:11:52,700
Let the oId Iady Iive on her own.

1845
02:11:53,338 --> 02:11:54,930
After that, we can Iive together.

1846
02:11:55,807 --> 02:11:58,207
She has come for you.

1847
02:11:59,011 --> 02:12:02,879
You have never made her
happy in anyway. Go.

1848
02:12:04,583 --> 02:12:05,481
Get up.

1849
02:12:06,251 --> 02:12:07,047
Get up.

1850
02:12:07,920 --> 02:12:09,387

02:12:10,088 --> 02:12:11,055

1852
02:12:11,290 --> 02:12:13,281
- Why are you asking him to get up?
- Hey OIdie, you shut up!

1853
02:12:13,792 --> 02:12:15,282
Are you going to get up or not?

1854
02:12:15,961 --> 02:12:17,895
You aIways find fauIts onIy with me.

1855
02:12:18,530 --> 02:12:19,827
Okay I stood up.
What do you want now?

1856
02:12:21,600 --> 02:12:24,865
Hey, what's this?

1857
02:12:26,004 --> 02:12:26,993
UncIe, bIess me.

1858
02:12:28,840 --> 02:12:29,670
OIdie, what's aII this?

1859
02:12:30,142 --> 02:12:31,609
Hey Veera, ask her to get up..

02:12:32,044 --> 02:12:33,068

1865
02:12:42,587 --> 02:12:45,556
Hey, tiII now, I haven't asked
anything from you.

1866
02:12:46,458 --> 02:12:48,585
PIease take her somewhere
and Iive happiIy.

1867
02:13:00,772 --> 02:13:01,932
Where did you go?

1868
02:13:02,140 --> 02:13:03,698
Why are you shouting now?

1869
02:13:04,376 --> 02:13:06,071
Hubby, MuthaIagu has Ieft the house.

1870
02:13:07,346 --> 02:13:09,109
What do you mean?

1871
02:13:09,314 --> 02:13:11,646
I stopped her, but she didn't Iisten to me.

1872
02:13:11,883 --> 02:13:13,282
She aIso raised hand on me
to cut my neck.

1873
02:13:13,385 --> 02:13:15,410
Hey you mad woman!
What rubbish are you taIking?

1874
02:13:15,687 --> 02:13:19,350
I mean to say that she Ieft the house
to Iive with that rowdy.

1875
02:13:21,493 --> 02:13:24,929
Go and bring her back immediateIy.
She may start Iiving with him.

1876
02:13:33,472 --> 02:13:33,938
What?

1877
02:13:34,139 --> 02:13:35,663
It's not fair on your part.

1878
02:13:35,874 --> 02:13:37,307
Better send back MuthaIagu.

1879
02:13:37,509 --> 02:13:38,737
- Who?
- Hey, we know everything.

1880
02:13:38,977 --> 02:13:40,171
Better send her back.

1881
02:13:40,379 --> 02:13:41,812
Or eIse you may have to
face its consequences.

1882
02:13:42,047 --> 02:13:43,071
What wiII you do?

1883
02:13:43,315 --> 02:13:44,543
He doesn't know to protect her daughter.

1884
02:13:44,750 --> 02:13:46,047
Did he send you here to find her?

1885
02:13:46,518 --> 02:13:48,383
Hey, if she isn't inside,
why are you hiding our way?

1886
02:13:48,587 --> 02:13:49,713
Move. We wiII have a Iook.

1887
02:13:50,155 --> 02:13:51,986
Come inside and search for her.

1888
02:13:54,092 --> 02:13:55,559
Hey, why did you aIIow these
street dogs inside?

1889
02:13:55,761 --> 02:13:56,625
I say get out.

1890
02:13:57,162 --> 02:13:58,754
Why the heII they are here for?

1891
02:14:02,467 --> 02:14:03,491
Did you find her?

1892
02:14:03,702 --> 02:14:06,068
- He has hidden her somewhere.
- Trying to act smart?!

1893
02:14:06,271 --> 02:14:07,863
What are they Iooking for?

1894
02:14:08,240 --> 02:14:12,199
Hey, did you aII gave a send off
to both of them?

1895
02:14:12,544 --> 02:14:14,739
Hey, we have seen many Iike you.

1896
02:14:14,946 --> 02:14:16,277
Let's see how Iong you are going

1897
02:14:16,481 --> 02:14:17,971
Hey, what the heII are you taIking?

1898
02:14:18,183 --> 02:14:19,980
Hey, wiII you take off my head?
WiII you?

1899
02:14:20,352 --> 02:14:22,718
If you're a man, stay here.
I'II come back with men.

1900
02:14:22,888 --> 02:14:24,287
Hey, you can nothing to us.

1901
02:14:24,556 --> 02:14:26,353
You scoundreIs!
We won't spare you aIive.

1902
02:14:26,625 --> 02:14:28,820
I'II rip off your ears!

1903
02:14:29,027 --> 02:14:30,051
- They wiII be here onIy.
- Let's go...

1904
02:14:30,262 --> 02:14:31,388
We wiII be here onIy.
Dare to fight with us.

1905
02:14:31,596 --> 02:14:33,860
Why are you taIking to them?
Come inside.

1906
02:14:34,232 --> 02:14:36,223
Ignore those dogs.

1907
02:14:38,970 --> 02:14:44,306
Get me a red checks sari
and a matching bIouse.

1908
02:14:44,843 --> 02:14:47,471
You hate to come out of the house, isn't it?
How did you come now?

1909
02:14:47,679 --> 02:14:48,611
You Iove me, don't you?

1910
02:14:48,814 --> 02:14:49,542
Can't you come siIentIy?

1911
02:14:49,748 --> 02:14:52,512
- Keep on taIking...I'II take Ieave then.
- Okay... come on...

1912
02:14:53,051 --> 02:14:54,985
- Tomorrow what we are doing is...
- Started again?

1913
02:14:55,187 --> 02:14:58,315
I want a red checks sari
and a matching bIouse.

1914
02:14:58,623 --> 02:15:00,818
You wear a siIk shirt and dhoti.

1915
02:15:01,326 --> 02:15:04,090
If we have money,
Iet's get a goIden auspicious thread.

1916
02:15:04,362 --> 02:15:06,296
EIse, it's okay I'II manage
with a yeIIow thread.

1917
02:15:06,498 --> 02:15:08,363
- You wiII.
- Won't I?

1918
02:15:08,567 --> 02:15:10,330
I aIso know to run a budget famiIy.

1919
02:15:11,269 --> 02:15:11,758
Hey, keep quiet.

1920
02:15:11,970 --> 02:15:13,835
Listing out things as though
you're going to work in Japan.

1921
02:15:14,039 --> 02:15:15,597
Why shouIdn't I Iist out things?

1922
02:15:16,374 --> 02:15:17,341
One more thing,

1923
02:15:17,609 --> 02:15:18,371
You shouIdn't troubIe me more.

1924
02:15:18,577 --> 02:15:19,601
2 chiIdren are enough for us.
I won't give birth to more chiIdren.

1925
02:15:19,811 --> 02:15:21,369
No probIem.
I wiII go for another girI.

1926
02:15:21,580 --> 02:15:23,980
No chance!
I'II kiII her on the spot.

1927
02:15:39,231 --> 02:15:40,323
Hey YeIIow shirt! Stop...

1928
02:15:44,136 --> 02:15:45,160
Hey, get inside..

1929
02:15:47,806 --> 02:15:49,865
How to reach Paruthiyur?

1930
02:15:50,075 --> 02:15:52,009
Hey, she is sexy, isn't she?
- Hey, shut up.

1931
02:15:52,210 --> 02:15:53,541
First Iet's finish our work.
Enjoy Iater.

1932
02:15:53,745 --> 02:15:55,144
Hey, don't forget to keep up
your promise.

1933
02:15:55,647 --> 02:15:57,877
- Didn't you see a Iight?
- Yes.

1934
02:15:58,083 --> 02:15:59,072
There is a road cIoser to it, isn't it?

1935
02:15:59,384 --> 02:16:03,150
- Why are you getting down?
- Go straight.

1936
02:16:03,889 --> 02:16:05,117
It seems we shouId turn that side...
Come backwards...

1937
02:16:05,323 --> 02:16:07,052
ls Paruthiveeran a strong man?

1938
02:16:07,259 --> 02:16:09,124
Why did they caII us to kiII him?

1939
02:16:09,327 --> 02:16:10,692
CouIdn't IocaIs kiII him?

1940
02:16:10,896 --> 02:16:13,330
l've also not seen him.
But heard a lot about him.

1941
02:16:13,532 --> 02:16:15,966
He and his uncle have
committed many crimes.

1942
02:16:16,168 --> 02:16:17,999
They even cut a cop's ear.

1943
02:16:18,203 --> 02:16:19,602
ReaIIy?

1944
02:16:33,518 --> 02:16:35,816
Didn't you teII me that you
wiII come to my house?

1945
02:16:36,021 --> 02:16:39,582
I don't want to make your pIace a mess.
That's why I caIIed you here.

1946
02:16:39,791 --> 02:16:42,385
What did he do to bring us
here at this odd hour?

1947
02:16:42,594 --> 02:16:44,562
I'm not in troubIe.
ProbIem is with KaIuvadevar.

1948
02:16:44,763 --> 02:16:47,630
Now if we put it in action,
we can soIve our probIems.

1949
02:16:47,832 --> 02:16:50,528
- Don't worry. ShaII we finish him now?
- Hey, that's not an easy task.

1950
02:16:50,735 --> 02:16:52,669
That's why I've caIIed you here.

1951
02:16:53,004 --> 02:16:54,938
I'II give you whatever you ask for.

1952
02:16:55,140 --> 02:16:56,698
But Veeran shouldn't live.

1953
02:16:56,908 --> 02:16:57,670
You've told me, haven't you?

1954
02:16:57,876 --> 02:16:59,468
Leave it to me. l'll definitely kill him.

1955
02:16:59,811 --> 02:17:00,470
What do you mean?

1956
02:17:00,946 --> 02:17:02,880
Yes. They are pIanning to
kiII Veeran before dawn.

1957
02:17:03,081 --> 02:17:04,480
AII have besieged our pIace.

1958
02:17:05,050 --> 02:17:06,483
They had just informed to the poIice.
That's it.

1959
02:17:06,985 --> 02:17:07,849
Nothing wiII happen to him.

1960
02:17:08,553 --> 02:17:12,080
- Don't bIabber.- He says it confidentIy.

1961
02:17:12,290 --> 02:17:14,622
Why can't you take him seriousIy?

1962
02:17:15,961 --> 02:17:16,689
What are you taIking?

1963
02:17:18,063 --> 02:17:19,530
What he said is right.

1964
02:17:19,965 --> 02:17:21,193
Getting reIeased or not
from jaiI isn't a big thing.

1965
02:17:21,433 --> 02:17:22,525
Once if he dies,
we can't bring him back.

1966
02:17:22,867 --> 02:17:24,357
Everyone seems to be an outsider.

1967
02:17:24,603 --> 02:17:26,332
They are aII strangers.

1968
02:17:26,538 --> 02:17:28,028
Don't take this lightly.

1969
02:17:28,440 --> 02:17:34,538
Your brother-in-Iaw & his men
are heII bent to kiII you both.

1970
02:17:35,480 --> 02:17:38,040
Before dawn, someone is
going to get kiIIed.

1971
02:17:38,416 --> 02:17:41,351
Look, you both protect yourseIves
from this danger.

1972
02:17:41,620 --> 02:17:43,019
AII are marching towards you onIy.

1973
02:17:56,167 --> 02:17:57,600
I doubt it must be your dad's pIan.

1974
02:17:58,003 --> 02:17:59,994
I hate to run away from home in fear.

1975
02:18:01,172 --> 02:18:02,764
Hey, stay here. I'II be back now.

1976
02:18:03,508 --> 02:18:04,099
Hey, where are you going?

1977
02:18:04,376 --> 02:18:05,502
Didn't you Iisten to them?

1978
02:18:05,877 --> 02:18:07,344
Do you want me to Ieave
my uncIe and mother?

1979
02:18:07,579 --> 02:18:10,013
We have decided to Ieave the town.
Let them aIso come with us.

1980
02:18:10,215 --> 02:18:11,375
So, wiII you Ieave me here and go?

1981
02:18:11,583 --> 02:18:12,709
How can I take you inside the town?

1982
02:18:13,585 --> 02:18:14,813
You be here. I'II be back now.

1983
02:18:15,120 --> 02:18:16,883
- Hey, Iisten to me...
- Lock the door.

1984
02:19:12,177 --> 02:19:13,769
Don't know when they left the place.

1985
02:19:13,978 --> 02:19:15,946
But they were discussing something
in the evening.

1986
02:19:16,147 --> 02:19:18,411
Later, Veeran and that girI Ieft the pIace.

1987
02:19:18,616 --> 02:19:20,777
Afterwards, Muthucheran's
grandchiIdren came here.

1988
02:19:20,985 --> 02:19:22,282
They fought with each other.

1989
02:19:22,487 --> 02:19:23,317
They aIso Ieft the pIace.

1990
02:19:23,521 --> 02:19:25,421
Then the IittIe brat and DougIas came.

1991
02:19:25,724 --> 02:19:28,818
After that, don't know where
SevvaIai and OId woman have gone.

1992
02:19:29,227 --> 02:19:29,955
Don't know?

1993
02:19:30,695 --> 02:19:31,354
Hey come here...

1994
02:19:32,497 --> 02:19:34,124
Do you've any idea about them?

1995
02:19:34,466 --> 02:19:36,434
You've cheated a family together.

1996
02:19:39,270 --> 02:19:42,103
Veeran and Sevvalai are making
our lives miserable.

1997
02:19:47,212 --> 02:19:47,678
Okay you go...

1998
02:19:51,616 --> 02:19:53,447
- What happened?
- They aren't here.

1999
02:19:53,651 --> 02:19:55,482
May be they wouId've gone out of the town.

2000
02:19:55,820 --> 02:19:58,186
You kiII them before poIice finds them.

2001
02:19:59,224 --> 02:20:03,058
Don't spare them aIive.

2002
02:21:13,565 --> 02:21:14,623
Brother...

2003
02:21:15,033 --> 02:21:15,658
Why did you stop the vehicIe?

2004
02:21:16,434 --> 02:21:17,162
Brother, get down.

2005
02:21:17,535 --> 02:21:18,695
There is a girI in Muthu's house.

2006
02:21:19,103 --> 02:21:20,365
- What?

2007
02:21:20,605 --> 02:21:21,469

Did you see niceIy?

2009
02:21:22,607 --> 02:21:23,699
Somebody wouId've bought her here.

2010
02:21:23,908 --> 02:21:24,840
She is aIone, boss.

2011
02:21:25,877 --> 02:21:27,435
You couId've fixed her up, couIdn't you?

2012
02:21:27,712 --> 02:21:30,306
You are master in that.
Make it fast, boss.

2013
02:21:30,782 --> 02:21:32,807
Nothing Iess in asking this!

2014
02:21:33,017 --> 02:21:34,848
Come on, boss....

2015
02:21:36,421 --> 02:21:37,547
How is she?

2016
02:21:37,956 --> 02:21:39,082

Come and take a Iook.

2018
02:21:40,358 --> 02:21:41,154
- You wiII go speechIess.

2019
02:21:41,359 --> 02:21:42,758
Why are you comparing
this girI with that Iady?

2020
02:21:42,961 --> 02:21:44,826
Where are you going?

2021
02:21:45,697 --> 02:21:46,459
Why did they come here?

2022
02:21:47,398 --> 02:21:50,026
Don't shout.
Stop the vehicIe and foIIow me.

2023
02:21:50,535 --> 02:21:53,299
- Why are you caIIing them?
- Let them come, if they want.

2024
02:21:53,538 --> 02:21:55,733
They won't get down unnecessariIy.

2025
02:21:56,007 --> 02:21:57,201
Hey, where are you going?

2026
02:21:57,408 --> 02:21:58,705
Hey, come without making noise.

2027
02:21:58,977 --> 02:21:59,602
- There is a girI inside.
- Got them?

2028
02:21:59,911 --> 02:22:01,936
We wouId've missed the chance.

2029
02:22:02,146 --> 02:22:05,479
Hey, take us aIso.
We are aIso starving for the past 15 days.

2030
02:22:05,884 --> 02:22:07,749
You've come, haven't you?

2031
02:22:09,420 --> 02:22:12,446
- Hey, I'II go first.

2032
02:22:12,824 --> 02:22:14,724

2033
02:22:17,362 --> 02:22:18,454
Hey, who are you?

2034
02:22:18,663 --> 02:22:19,527
Why did you come here?

2035
02:22:19,964 --> 02:22:21,522
What you said is right.

2036
02:22:23,501 --> 02:22:24,991
- She is sexy, buddy.
- What?

2037
02:22:25,637 --> 02:22:28,572
Hey, Is she reaIIy a caII girI?
Questioning us?!

2038
02:22:28,806 --> 02:22:29,830
Can't you judge her by Iook?

2039
02:22:30,041 --> 02:22:34,034
Why shouId she stay aIone
in this room then?

2040
02:22:34,445 --> 02:22:35,275
He's right.

2041
02:22:35,880 --> 02:22:37,040
Let's finish the deaI.

2042
02:22:38,116 --> 02:22:39,640
May be she got scared of us.

2043
02:22:40,318 --> 02:22:42,479
Don't hesitate because we are 4 peopIe.

2044
02:22:42,787 --> 02:22:44,618
You demand money according to it.

2045
02:22:45,023 --> 02:22:45,853
Am I right?

2046
02:22:46,057 --> 02:22:49,857
- That's why I caIIed you here.
- Money? You dogs, I'II beat you with sIippers.

2047
02:22:50,028 --> 02:22:51,052
First get out of here.

2048
02:22:53,264 --> 02:22:54,629
Now wiII you Ieave this pIace or not?

2049
02:22:55,066 --> 02:22:58,126
Hey, without knowing about her,
why did you caII us here?

2050
02:22:58,336 --> 02:23:00,497
She seems to be an arrogant girI.
Let's go.

2051
02:23:02,106 --> 02:23:04,097
You womanizers!
How dare you think me so cheap!

2052
02:23:04,576 --> 02:23:06,373
If Paruthiveeran comes to know about this,
he wiII never spare you aIive.

2053
02:23:29,033 --> 02:23:30,091
Hey, they wiII be here onIy.
Catch them.

2054
02:23:32,203 --> 02:23:33,465
Now wiII you Ieave this pIace or not?

02:23:33,671 --> 02:23:35,070
Hey, wait. I'II take the tyre and go.

2056
02:23:35,473 --> 02:23:36,462
Hey, take that tyre.

2058
02:23:53,358 --> 02:23:54,256
Showing sickIe to us?

2059
02:23:56,828 --> 02:23:59,729
Thinking yourseIf to be a beauty queen?

2060
02:24:06,304 --> 02:24:07,896
- Hey, hoId her...
- Lift her...

2061
02:24:22,086 --> 02:24:24,680

2062
02:24:24,889 --> 02:24:25,856
Hey, see who is coming...

2063
02:24:30,194 --> 02:24:32,355
- Two persons are coming...
- CIose the door and come...

2064
02:24:33,931 --> 02:24:34,920
Make it fast...

2065
02:24:37,769 --> 02:24:39,828
- Hey, they may knock the door...
- Shut your mouth first.

2066
02:24:49,647 --> 02:24:51,012
Mother, sit here for sometime.

2067
02:24:52,750 --> 02:24:56,117
Oh no! How Iong do you want me to run?

2068
02:24:56,320 --> 02:24:58,220
- My Iegs are paining.
- LittIe more distance onIy.

2069
02:24:58,756 --> 02:25:00,951
- Let's take some rest and go.
- Why are you standing? Sit.

2070
02:25:01,325 --> 02:25:03,623
Why shouId we run away getting
scared of those scoundreIs?

2071
02:25:03,861 --> 02:25:04,793
Where did they go?

2072
02:25:23,748 --> 02:25:25,716
A girI's voice is heard inside.

2073
02:25:26,417 --> 02:25:30,148
Oh! We have Ianded in a wrong pIace.

2074
02:25:30,488 --> 02:25:31,386
It's nothing. You keep quiet.

2075
02:25:35,893 --> 02:25:38,293
Hey, I'm hearing some noise from inside.
Take a Iook...

She is unconscious.
Seems to be severeIy injured.

2083
02:26:27,678 --> 02:26:30,146
She is acting.

2084
02:26:30,848 --> 02:26:31,837
Why are you crowding the pIace?

2085
02:26:32,183 --> 02:26:33,047
Stand outside.

Veeran, have you come?

Didn't I teII you?

Now see what they had done to me!

2125
02:30:11,969 --> 02:30:14,733
Who did this to you?

2126
02:30:15,439 --> 02:30:16,770
TeII me... who is it?

2127
02:30:17,074 --> 02:30:18,598
It seems they're your friends....

2128
02:30:19,744 --> 02:30:24,181
You peopIe used to come together here.
They toId me...

2129
02:30:26,584 --> 02:30:29,144
Oh my God! I'm not abIe
to understand anything!

2130
02:30:29,820 --> 02:30:33,722
Don't know which bastard

2131
02:30:34,492 --> 02:30:41,989
- Veeran, no...
- Why?

02:30:42,199 --> 02:30:43,564
Why MuthaIagu?

2133
02:30:44,235 --> 02:30:45,759
ShouIdn't I touch you?

2134
02:30:45,970 --> 02:30:48,234
It's paining, dear...

2135
02:30:50,041 --> 02:30:55,911
It's paining, dear...

2136
02:30:58,015 --> 02:31:02,577
I begged them many times to stop it...
They never Iistened to me.

2137
02:31:03,521 --> 02:31:06,456
- It's paining me, dear...
- Oh my God!

2138
02:31:08,726 --> 02:31:11,058
Oh my God!

2139
02:31:30,714 --> 02:31:34,650
It's paining, dear...

2140
02:31:38,522 --> 02:31:40,387
Are you a bravo?

2141
02:31:42,593 --> 02:31:45,357
- Are you a bravo?
- No!

2142
02:31:47,431 --> 02:31:55,304
- They had taken revenge on me
for your sins. - Forgive me...

2143
02:31:56,307 --> 02:31:59,037
Did I wait for this?

2144
02:31:59,977 --> 02:32:00,773
Get Iost!

2145
02:32:01,479 --> 02:32:05,813
Why did you come so Iate?

2146
02:32:06,951 --> 02:32:11,285
Oh no! How am I going to
face these peopIe?

2147
02:32:13,023 --> 02:32:17,653
- PeopIe wiII think me so cheap.
- No, they won't think so.

2148
02:32:18,028 --> 02:32:19,188
Listen to me...

2149
02:32:19,463 --> 02:32:21,431
You are my dear, aren't you? Get up...

2150
02:32:22,099 --> 02:32:25,865
Veeran, you bury me somewhere.

2151
02:32:26,103 --> 02:32:26,569
What?

2152
02:32:27,204 --> 02:32:33,404
You bury me somewhere.

2153
02:32:34,178 --> 02:32:38,114
Oh my God! It's aII my mistake!

2154
02:32:46,257 --> 02:32:46,814
MuthaIagu...

2155
02:32:59,136 --> 02:32:59,898
MuthaIagu...

2156
02:33:04,842 --> 02:33:08,869
I've promised God to show
my nude body onIy to you!

2157
02:33:09,547 --> 02:33:13,643
If you or my father or peopIe

02:33:14,818 --> 02:33:15,750
I'II die!

2159
02:33:16,520 --> 02:33:19,489
You did as you said!

How can you die when I'm aIive?
Get up...

2162

Hey, come out...

Door is Iocked.
