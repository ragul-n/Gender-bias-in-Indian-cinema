Goddess Shakti's temple'

'Okay, ma'

5
00:02:36,861 --> 00:02:38,941
Ma, close the gate

6
00:02:58,821 --> 00:02:59,981
Finish him off

7
00:03:02,501 --> 00:03:03,581
Let's scoot

8
00:03:07,461 --> 00:03:10,021
Come on
Start the bike

9
00:03:11,181 --> 00:03:12,301
Quick

10
00:03:12,781 --> 00:03:14,141
Let's go

11
00:03:19,461 --> 00:03:20,901
'A year ago's

What are you thinking about?

21
00:04:03,461 --> 00:04:04,501
Go back a little

- Thank you, sir
- Congratulations

49
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:22,701
A small request to the Collector

50
00:06:22,741 --> 00:06:26,901
For many years we have been
using this place as our ground

51
00:06:26,941 --> 00:06:29,821
But this place isn't very secure
or maintained properly

52
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,727
Every now and then we see
encroachment here by way of huts

53
00:06:31,862 --> 00:06:34,382
It is a big headache to
vacate them from here

54
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:37,949
I've been the councilor
of this town for 15 years

55
00:06:38,021 --> 00:06:42,181
Often I've requested my Chairman
to raise a compound wall here

56
00:06:42,221 --> 00:06:44,021
But he turned
a deaf ear to my pleas

57
00:06:44,061 --> 00:06:47,501
I gave a petition to
the concerned politicians

58
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,393
But that was also in vain

59
00:06:49,418 --> 00:06:51,858
I'm making this plea
on behalf of our town

60
00:06:51,887 --> 00:06:55,287
I hope and pray you will be
able to solve our problem

61
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:01,767
Dude, shall we leave?

62
00:07:01,792 --> 00:07:04,872
Call Balaji and tell him we won the match
and we are heading to Pondicherry

63
00:07:05,021 --> 00:07:06,901
If it's liquor,
he'll come in a jiffy

64
00:07:12,501 --> 00:07:13,261
"We are"

65
00:07:13,301 --> 00:07:14,781

"To Pondicherry by the sea
dude, come and join our party"

72
00:07:46,621 --> 00:07:51,661
"No shortage of currency
Pull up your collar high and mighty"

73
00:07:53,381 --> 00:07:56,501
"Not an ounce of worry
No trace of fear really"

74
00:07:56,581 --> 00:08:00,101
"If friends support us
we'll rock on with success"

75
00:08:00,181 --> 00:08:03,454
"Life is just a game
Let's play to make a name"

76
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:07,039
"If we strive high for a sixer
we'll be Sachin the master blaster"

77
00:08:13,461 --> 00:08:14,421
"We are us"

78
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:15,061
"Ourselves"

79
00:08:15,101 --> 00:08:15,981
"Lightweights"

80
00:08:16,021 --> 00:08:16,775
"No regrets"

81
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,640
"Our antics"

82
00:08:17,665 --> 00:08:18,745
"Wildly surface"

83
00:08:18,815 --> 00:08:20,215
"King of our area in all ways"

84
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,080
"We are"

85
00:08:21,105 --> 00:08:21,785
"Simply"

86
00:08:21,832 --> 00:08:22,592
"Small fry"

87
00:08:22,663 --> 00:08:23,423
"Nobody"

88
00:08:23,448 --> 00:08:24,368
"Our revelry"

89
00:08:24,464 --> 00:08:25,264
"Tomfoolery"

90
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:27,679
"But we rule the roost happily"

91
00:09:07,628 --> 00:09:10,748
"Say 'no' to beard, if we have money"

92
00:09:10,821 --> 00:09:14,421
"Then 'Miss World' will be yours, sonny"

93
00:09:14,461 --> 00:09:17,581
"Our life is like the 'One Day' match"

94
00:09:17,621 --> 00:09:21,021
"Lose this moment, you miss the catch"

95
00:09:21,101 --> 00:09:24,221
"Good riddance to girls
No such fancy frills"

96
00:09:24,371 --> 00:09:27,731
"Friends are enough
No add-ons or any such stuff"

97
00:09:27,756 --> 00:09:31,116
"To rockets a strict no
Veto flight also"

98
00:09:31,141 --> 00:09:34,821
"To fly high in the sky
a bottle is enough as ally"

99
00:09:34,846 --> 00:09:38,166
"Whomever you meet
don't just simply greet"

100
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:41,510
"Even if God comes down
we'll ask Him for a loan"

101
00:09:41,637 --> 00:09:45,117
"Whomever you meet
don't take a backseat"

102
00:09:45,181 --> 00:09:49,141
"Even if Yama lands here
we'll hit Him, no fear"

103
00:09:55,079 --> 00:09:56,759
"We are"

104
00:09:56,901 --> 00:09:58,301
"Whatever!"

105
00:09:58,341 --> 00:09:59,781
"Our game"

106
00:10:00,301 --> 00:10:01,981
"King in the Hall of Fame"

107
00:10:02,061 --> 00:10:03,301
"We are"

108
00:10:03,381 --> 00:10:05,261
"No star"

109
00:10:05,301 --> 00:10:06,581
"Our way"

110
00:10:07,141 --> 00:10:09,781
"Lord of all we survey"

111
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,582
- Where are you?
- In Kanchipuram

112
00:10:19,701 --> 00:10:21,621
Tomorrow morning
I should get my money

113
00:10:21,646 --> 00:10:23,526
Otherwise I will be
at your doorstep

114
00:10:23,612 --> 00:10:25,972
- You know me, right?
- I'll come in the morning, bro

115
00:10:26,021 --> 00:10:27,541
If you're thinking
of cheating me-

116
00:10:27,581 --> 00:10:29,501
No, bro, I'll pay it
tomorrow for sure

117
00:10:30,021 --> 00:10:32,661
Satish wanted me to get
the kit bag for practice

118
00:10:32,701 --> 00:10:34,221
It's right there
Take it and go

119
00:10:37,301 --> 00:10:39,101
Hey, take this bat also

120
00:10:39,581 --> 00:10:42,061
'You don't know about me
Go ahead and enquire about me'

121
00:10:42,086 --> 00:10:43,546
What's happening there?
Who's shouting?

122
00:10:43,634 --> 00:10:46,794
That engineer's sister
has come to visit him

123
00:10:46,918 --> 00:10:48,998
Gita's grandma
is fighting with her

124
00:10:49,101 --> 00:10:50,061
Okay, go inside

125
00:10:50,101 --> 00:10:51,861
'Didn't you think of
asking this old lady?'

126
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,621
'Do you think what
she did was correct?'

127
00:10:53,661 --> 00:10:54,781
'Please question her'

128
00:10:54,853 --> 00:10:57,213
No one is respecting me
in this street nowadays

129
00:10:57,253 --> 00:10:58,933
'You're dumping the garbage here'

130
00:10:59,021 --> 00:10:59,741
'Won't you think?'

131
00:10:59,821 --> 00:11:00,661
Move aside, please

132
00:11:00,741 --> 00:11:02,981
What if the kids here get infected?

133
00:11:03,021 --> 00:11:05,101
You thought you could
get away with this?

134
00:11:05,181 --> 00:11:07,078
I'll break your arm if you dump
the garbage here next time

135
00:11:07,103 --> 00:11:09,223
Look how rude she is

136
00:11:09,516 --> 00:11:11,582
Hello, is this how
you talk to elders?

137
00:11:11,607 --> 00:11:13,887
Who are you?
Are you the town head?

138
00:11:14,021 --> 00:11:16,106
I don't talk to people who brush
their teeth on the street!

139
00:11:16,288 --> 00:11:17,608
This is how she retorts

140
00:11:17,821 --> 00:11:20,221
If you dump trash in front of
the house, won't people ask?

141
00:11:20,261 --> 00:11:21,341
That's what we usually do

142
00:11:21,422 --> 00:11:24,344
It's been a month since that lady came
and she has never yelled at us

143
00:11:24,377 --> 00:11:26,009
This princess came
in the morning

144
00:11:26,064 --> 00:11:28,184
She has been jumping
like a headless chicken

145
00:11:28,326 --> 00:11:31,846
Hey old lady, if you address me with
scant respect, I'll chop you to bits

146
00:11:31,964 --> 00:11:33,168
Why are you standing there quietly?

147
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,273
Take her inside

148
00:11:34,581 --> 00:11:36,266
Bhuvana, come inside
Whatever it is we can-

149
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:37,611
Anna, keep quiet

150
00:11:37,636 --> 00:11:39,476
First find out who
committed the mistake

151
00:11:39,701 --> 00:11:41,421
Instead of that you are
asking me to go in

152
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:43,221
How dare you come
to our street and-

153
00:11:43,261 --> 00:11:45,301
Hey! Are you threatening me, huh?

154
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:50,101
My God!

155
00:11:58,701 --> 00:12:00,852
You're acting so smart
Let's go now to the police station

156
00:12:00,877 --> 00:12:01,717
What's your problem?

157
00:12:01,941 --> 00:12:04,181
Shouldn't dump the trash here, right?
It won't happen again

158
00:12:04,221 --> 00:12:05,661
Please don't dump it here, okay?

159
00:12:05,701 --> 00:12:07,002
Tomorrow if she does it again...

160
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:09,747
...I'll dump trash from
my house and hers

161
00:12:09,941 --> 00:12:11,861
...in your house

162
00:12:12,105 --> 00:12:15,025
The whole street was buzzing with
all the folks standing out and gazing

163
00:12:15,261 --> 00:12:17,341
Why didn't you call me?
I would've come at once

164
00:12:17,421 --> 00:12:18,461
How did that girl look?

165
00:12:18,501 --> 00:12:20,146
Wondering why that question
didn't pop up earlier!

166
00:12:20,171 --> 00:12:22,571
Even if we talk about an old lady,
your antennae will rise, no?!

167
00:12:22,781 --> 00:12:23,621
As if I spoke to her?

168
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:24,781
He did

169
00:12:24,821 --> 00:12:26,164
And he was too good
Ask him about it

170
00:12:26,189 --> 00:12:27,949
What did you both talk about?

171
00:12:28,062 --> 00:12:29,422
Zip your lips and
mind your business

172
00:12:29,447 --> 00:12:31,047
What did they say?

173
00:12:31,141 --> 00:12:33,258
They both spoke
with their eyes

174
00:12:33,283 --> 00:12:35,083
She said 'Hi, I'm Bhuvaneshwari'

175
00:12:35,108 --> 00:12:37,344
He said 'Hi, I'm Pugazh'

176
00:12:37,495 --> 00:12:40,015
He spoke in English and
took her in his bike real fast

177
00:12:40,141 --> 00:12:42,301
You don't pull a fast one

178
00:12:42,901 --> 00:12:45,063
He spoke English to a chick
and whisked her away!

179
00:12:45,088 --> 00:12:46,088
You expect me to believe

180
00:12:46,181 --> 00:12:47,741
You haven't ditched
that lice-head as yet?

181
00:12:47,821 --> 00:12:49,581
At least I have a girlfriend
Just shut up!

182
00:12:50,719 --> 00:12:52,036
Dude, I'm taking your bike

183
00:12:52,061 --> 00:12:54,181
Don't use my bike
Put the key down

184
00:12:54,221 --> 00:12:54,941
Only 5 minutes

185
00:12:54,996 --> 00:12:56,156
I'm telling you

186
00:12:56,263 --> 00:12:58,996
That girl is getting married next month!
He's having a ball with her

187
00:12:59,021 --> 00:13:01,901
She's to blame, lands up with an itch
without even brushing her teeth

188
00:13:01,941 --> 00:13:04,261
- You meant her head?
- No, you dickhead!

189
00:13:04,301 --> 00:13:06,661
Bro, I got a job in TVS company
under sports quota

190
00:13:06,701 --> 00:13:08,181
I heard this morning

191
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:09,701
- This ground is lucky
- Yes, bro

192
00:13:09,781 --> 00:13:12,097
If you had practiced a little harder,
you could've got a job in the Railways

193
00:13:12,122 --> 00:13:13,602
I just missed it

194
00:13:13,781 --> 00:13:15,781
We were just joking
Don't glorify yourself!

195
00:13:15,901 --> 00:13:17,021
Okay, bro...bye

196
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:20,236
Pugazh, looks like you were
mediating in the middle of the road

197
00:13:20,261 --> 00:13:22,421
Gita's grandma went
on a tirade early in the morning

198
00:13:22,476 --> 00:13:26,196
Even if a beautiful girl dumps trash
on a guy, he simply simpers

199
00:13:26,221 --> 00:13:28,141
It's a welcome change to
see you support the grandma!

200
00:13:28,181 --> 00:13:32,781
Parents raise their kids wanting them
to become an engineer or a doctor

201
00:13:32,821 --> 00:13:36,397
But your father brought you up
to question injustice

202
00:13:36,422 --> 00:13:39,342
If we question public grievance
and favor fairness and justice...

203
00:13:39,493 --> 00:13:41,413
...people brand us fools!

204
00:13:41,461 --> 00:13:44,461
Owning just 1 dress and
washing it every day...

205
00:13:44,501 --> 00:13:46,181
...traveling from one town to another

206
00:13:46,221 --> 00:13:48,861
...to address people is our movement
founded by our leader Jeevanandham

207
00:13:48,941 --> 00:13:51,741
If I share all this with you,
your brother tells me not to spoil you

208
00:13:51,781 --> 00:13:53,581
Strange to see foreigners in our town

209
00:13:53,621 --> 00:13:57,581
They are returning after checking
our river water this morning

210
00:14:11,701 --> 00:14:13,381
- Hello, bro
- What's he up to?

211
00:14:13,421 --> 00:14:14,701
He's jobless

212
00:14:16,461 --> 00:14:18,629
Das, if people get to know of this
it will blow out of proportion

213
00:14:18,654 --> 00:14:19,654
What will happen?

214
00:14:19,718 --> 00:14:21,958
If anyone opposes you,
you will beat them up in the quarry

215
00:14:21,983 --> 00:14:23,063
That's why I complained

216
00:14:23,236 --> 00:14:26,796
Do you think they are all fair?
Election is around the corner

217
00:14:26,821 --> 00:14:28,301
2.5 million is the bribe for a post

218
00:14:28,341 --> 00:14:29,685
Will you part with
your father's money?

219
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:30,950
You complained so impulsively

220
00:14:31,116 --> 00:14:33,927
That I smuggle sand, brew
illicit liquor, sandalwood

221
00:14:34,021 --> 00:14:36,261
That's exactly why I've been
given a post in the party

222
00:14:36,301 --> 00:14:38,141
Don't justify all your mistakes

223
00:14:38,181 --> 00:14:40,461
You know our party has earned
a bad name because of you?

224
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:41,661
I won't keep quiet

225
00:14:41,771 --> 00:14:44,011
That is possible only if you
step out of this place

226
00:14:45,941 --> 00:14:47,061
Surprise call at this hour?

227
00:14:47,101 --> 00:14:51,381
Tomorrow at 10:00 a.m Finance minister
Ramasamy is going to Bangalore via our town

228
00:14:51,421 --> 00:14:52,901
Give him the due respect

229
00:14:52,941 --> 00:14:54,981
At such short notice, bro?

230
00:14:55,301 --> 00:14:56,192
It is already 4:30 a.m

231
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,800
Do you have any sense at all?

232
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:00,039
Tomorrow if we go
to him for a favor...

233
00:15:00,126 --> 00:15:04,246
...won't he ask us why no one
followed basic protocol?

234
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:06,711
Okay, don't get upset
I'll arrange for it

235
00:15:06,821 --> 00:15:10,421
Don't contact me with excuses of
calls from chairman or minister

236
00:15:11,181 --> 00:15:12,981
I'll call you myself
after I finish my work

237
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:29,821
Sir should be here any minute
Ensure everything is fine

238
00:15:29,901 --> 00:15:32,021
- No problems, right?
- Nothing, sir

239
00:15:34,941 --> 00:15:35,981
Close 305

240
00:15:36,021 --> 00:15:36,741
Move

241
00:15:36,781 --> 00:15:37,901
Don't disturb

242
00:15:37,996 --> 00:15:40,716
If you want to say something
come to my office

243
00:15:40,741 --> 00:15:42,574
Please keep the flowers inside
I have to lock up your shop

244
00:15:42,686 --> 00:15:43,286
Why, sir?

245
00:15:43,357 --> 00:15:44,997
If you don't pay rent for 2 years,
what else to do?

246
00:15:45,061 --> 00:15:46,581
I've paid the rent promptly to Das

247
00:15:46,621 --> 00:15:47,941
If you've paid him
then ask him

248
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:49,021
Close the shop

249
00:15:49,101 --> 00:15:50,461
- Sir, this shop
- This one?

250
00:15:50,501 --> 00:15:52,261
Shut the shop
and seal it

251
00:15:52,301 --> 00:15:54,381
Ask them to meet me
in the office, seal it now

252
00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:55,912
Sir, why are you asking him
to close the shop?

253
00:15:55,937 --> 00:15:57,657
Go and ask the Commissioner

254
00:15:58,221 --> 00:15:59,381
Sir, please be magnanimous

255
00:15:59,421 --> 00:16:00,981
I've warned you many times

256
00:16:01,021 --> 00:16:01,901
I'll definitely pay

257
00:16:01,941 --> 00:16:03,301
Can't do that
Leave now

258
00:16:03,341 --> 00:16:04,541
Sir, why are you doing this?

259
00:16:04,647 --> 00:16:06,502
You haven't paid rent
for the past 2 years

260
00:16:06,527 --> 00:16:07,767
We have intimated you many times

261
00:16:07,792 --> 00:16:08,632
But no response

262
00:16:08,821 --> 00:16:09,662
What do you want me to do?

263
00:16:09,687 --> 00:16:11,447
We pay up promptly
on the 1st of every month

264
00:16:11,496 --> 00:16:12,696
Ask the person you gave it to

265
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:13,881
Don't talk to me

266
00:16:14,101 --> 00:16:16,461
Pugazh, how can they do this to us?

267
00:16:20,301 --> 00:16:20,981
Is that right?

268
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:22,501
Okay, we are ready here

269
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:23,316
I'll take care

270
00:16:23,341 --> 00:16:24,301
Wrap it up fast

271
00:16:24,454 --> 00:16:25,494
The minister has crossed Ocheri

272
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,279
Cement won't dry
according to your urgency

273
00:16:27,366 --> 00:16:29,046
Don't talk
Focus on your work

274
00:16:29,181 --> 00:16:31,356
You sent the other day, right?

275
00:16:31,381 --> 00:16:31,861
Bro?

276
00:16:31,912 --> 00:16:33,327
That's what he wants

277
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:34,821
Convince him
and send it

278
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:35,638
Won't we give it?

279
00:16:35,663 --> 00:16:36,233
Bro?

280
00:16:36,356 --> 00:16:38,836
- What do You want?
- Commissioner has closed our shops

281
00:16:38,861 --> 00:16:39,706
Will you send it?

282
00:16:39,731 --> 00:16:40,851
I'll talk to him, you go

283
00:16:40,941 --> 00:16:42,127
Don't mess it up

284
00:16:42,152 --> 00:16:43,792
- Bro
- What?

285
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:46,398
We'll get a truck load and we won't
have space to download

286
00:16:46,501 --> 00:16:48,661
If you change it
that chap will be stressed out

287
00:16:48,701 --> 00:16:50,061
I told you I'll talk to him

288
00:16:50,621 --> 00:16:52,021
Same place
Tourism bungalow

289
00:16:52,061 --> 00:16:52,834
Call me after the job is done

290
00:16:52,859 --> 00:16:53,819
But you don't under-

291
00:16:53,999 --> 00:16:56,319
You heard him, right?
Clear out now

292
00:16:56,344 --> 00:16:59,184
You think we are people you can buy
for a packet of 'biriyani' and a peg?

293
00:16:59,247 --> 00:17:00,927
It's a truck load of flowers
which will wilt and dry

294
00:17:00,952 --> 00:17:03,232
How dare you talk to me like that!

295
00:17:05,981 --> 00:17:06,901
Try hitting me

296
00:17:06,981 --> 00:17:08,221
What audacity?

297
00:17:08,301 --> 00:17:10,261
I was just talking
and he raised his hands

298
00:17:11,301 --> 00:17:12,301
Get lost!

299
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:31,381
- Mother, where's he?
- He's taking a shower

300
00:17:31,421 --> 00:17:33,021
Shower is all he needs now!

301
00:17:33,101 --> 00:17:34,981
Another brawl, huh?

302
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:36,381
Got any brains?

303
00:17:36,421 --> 00:17:38,221
Don't you know
what to talk and where?

304
00:17:38,261 --> 00:17:40,901
How does it matter which place?
Our business is getting affected

305
00:17:40,981 --> 00:17:42,301
I can only ask him
at his hot spot!

306
00:17:42,326 --> 00:17:43,766
What do you mean
by his 'hot spot'?

307
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:47,111
Ask him what his job is?
His response will be politics

308
00:17:47,261 --> 00:17:50,341
Listen to your older brother
Don't talk back

309
00:17:51,181 --> 00:17:53,981
What are you up to?
Pretending to study?

310
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:56,121
Deliver those roses
at uncle's place

311
00:17:56,146 --> 00:17:56,906
Go

312
00:18:03,381 --> 00:18:04,260
Tie it properly

313
00:18:04,285 --> 00:18:05,605
The flowers might get hurt!

314
00:18:06,981 --> 00:18:08,621
He has rented it from
the municipality for Rs 400

315
00:18:08,701 --> 00:18:10,068
And sub-letting it
to us for Rs 4000

316
00:18:10,093 --> 00:18:11,973
In 1 month he's taking
1 year's rent from us

317
00:18:11,998 --> 00:18:12,918
That's also fine

318
00:18:13,005 --> 00:18:14,765
But for the past 2 years
he hasn't paid the rent!

319
00:18:14,821 --> 00:18:16,341
That's why I went and inquired

320
00:18:16,421 --> 00:18:18,181
You got cocky and asked

321
00:18:18,221 --> 00:18:19,941
But whose loss is it?

322
00:18:19,981 --> 00:18:23,501
He's throwing a fit claiming
because of you he has lost face

323
00:18:23,649 --> 00:18:26,409
I was at the end of my tether
trying to placate him

324
00:18:27,301 --> 00:18:31,821
Finally he said pay the entire
amount and take the shop

325
00:18:32,301 --> 00:18:33,961
Mother, give me Rs 40000

326
00:18:33,986 --> 00:18:34,866
For what?

327
00:18:34,891 --> 00:18:36,891
He sends his men to collect the rent
on the 1st promptly

328
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:37,756
Ask him to pay

329
00:18:37,941 --> 00:18:38,741
Until then?

330
00:18:38,781 --> 00:18:40,901
Shall we both stay at home
and play indoor games?

331
00:18:41,501 --> 00:18:45,141
If we want to have a shop in
the market, we need the help of others

332
00:18:45,181 --> 00:18:47,656
If you keep picking up fights
with everyone you see on the road...

333
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,119
...you'll be minus a job tomorrow

334
00:18:49,144 --> 00:18:51,344
We don't need to live
with his handouts

335
00:18:51,941 --> 00:18:52,941
Hand-

336
00:18:54,141 --> 00:18:56,741
As if one weirdo isn't enough!
Are you also getting ready?

337
00:18:56,781 --> 00:18:58,020
Get inside

338
00:18:58,045 --> 00:19:00,805
If you're angry with your brother
why show it on our kid?

339
00:19:00,942 --> 00:19:02,822
Shall I show it on you?
Mind your damn business

340
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:04,781
I want to play, ma
I don't want to go for tuition

341
00:19:04,821 --> 00:19:06,701
Play video games again,
I'll break your hands

342
00:19:07,501 --> 00:19:09,181
Take him also in
your tuition class, Bhuvana

343
00:19:09,221 --> 00:19:11,341
- But he's already going for tuition
- Only in the evenings

344
00:19:11,366 --> 00:19:13,941
He gets up in the morning and
starts playing video games

345
00:19:14,102 --> 00:19:15,156
Not studying one bit

346
00:19:15,181 --> 00:19:17,941
Both his grandma and uncle
pamper him to the core

347
00:19:17,981 --> 00:19:18,941
Okay, sit down

348
00:19:19,804 --> 00:19:22,701
To get permission for
meeting on this ground...

349
00:19:22,741 --> 00:19:25,741
...they walk many times from
police station to municipality

350
00:19:25,781 --> 00:19:28,643
But after the meeting gets over
they just leave the place

351
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:29,748
Look at the rubbish

352
00:19:29,901 --> 00:19:32,501
Only we have to clean up
the mess afterwards

353
00:19:32,741 --> 00:19:34,393
Their meeting is only
with the wine shop

354
00:19:34,418 --> 00:19:36,658
They are themselves drunk
and lying on the floor

355
00:19:36,683 --> 00:19:37,483
Hey! Wake up

356
00:19:37,592 --> 00:19:40,752
We must have an order passed
not to sanction meetings here

357
00:19:40,823 --> 00:19:42,743
We must present a petition
to the Commissioner

358
00:19:42,901 --> 00:19:45,781
Because of them, extra liquor for
5 lakhs has been sold yesterday

359
00:19:46,031 --> 00:19:47,191
What can I say!

360
00:19:52,141 --> 00:19:53,581
Where did you go?

361
00:19:53,621 --> 00:19:55,194
Time is 10:30 p.m and
you are not back home as yet

362
00:19:55,219 --> 00:19:56,179
I'm in the ground, anna

363
00:19:56,381 --> 00:19:59,221
I don't know what you do spending
24 hours on that ground

364
00:19:59,261 --> 00:20:01,461
I sorted out all differences
and opened the shop

365
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:03,461
Time for the load now
Come to the shop soon

366
00:20:03,501 --> 00:20:05,301
Okay, anna
I'll be there now

367
00:20:06,261 --> 00:20:08,381
Wait here, I'll go to
the shop and be back

368
00:20:12,021 --> 00:20:14,781
- Selvi...Selvi
- What, sister?

369
00:20:15,054 --> 00:20:16,541
Did you buy fish
from this old lady?

370
00:20:16,566 --> 00:20:17,101
Yes, we did

371
00:20:17,181 --> 00:20:19,861
- How much did you pay for 6?
- I don't know

372
00:20:20,701 --> 00:20:21,741
Why?

373
00:20:21,781 --> 00:20:23,541
How much did you pay?

374
00:20:25,381 --> 00:20:26,941
He was the one
who bought it

375
00:20:27,661 --> 00:20:28,421
What, ma?

376
00:20:29,581 --> 00:20:31,181
How much did you pay for the fish?

377
00:20:31,221 --> 00:20:32,101
100 bucks

378
00:20:32,141 --> 00:20:33,781
Did you trust me when I said it?

379
00:20:33,821 --> 00:20:36,301
You thought I was hiking
the price just for you!

380
00:20:36,381 --> 00:20:39,628
2 days ago I bought the same fish
in the market for Rs 60

381
00:20:39,653 --> 00:20:41,493
Why should it matter
to us what you paid?

382
00:20:41,543 --> 00:20:42,583
What do you mean?

383
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,461
If you pay 100 bucks
for fish worth Rs 60...

384
00:20:44,516 --> 00:20:47,036
...this old lady is expecting
the same price from everyone

385
00:20:47,061 --> 00:20:48,699
Will you pay
whatever she asks?

386
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:50,911
Keep quiet, ma
Whose side are you on?

387
00:20:51,201 --> 00:20:54,097
You had better give
this fish for 60 bucks

388
00:20:54,141 --> 00:20:55,901
And pay them back 40 bucks

389
00:20:55,941 --> 00:20:58,181
What do you take me for?
Asking me to return the money

390
00:20:58,221 --> 00:21:00,181
You go and buy it in the market

391
00:21:00,221 --> 00:21:02,207
Are you cheating
this young fellow?

392
00:21:02,232 --> 00:21:03,752
Who is the 'young fellow'?

393
00:21:03,777 --> 00:21:04,537
Then?

394
00:21:04,592 --> 00:21:08,032
If you don't know the going rate
in the market, how do I call you?

395
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:10,854
I'll give you for 60 bucks, my dear girl

396
00:21:10,879 --> 00:21:12,959
Why are you arguing
with this poor fellow?

397
00:21:13,101 --> 00:21:15,701
First return that 40 bucks to them

398
00:21:15,781 --> 00:21:17,051
Grandma, no need
You leave now

399
00:21:17,095 --> 00:21:20,335
Thinks he is actor MGR
supporting all the grandmas in town

400
00:21:20,501 --> 00:21:22,224
If you want I'll support
your grandma too

401
00:21:22,249 --> 00:21:23,569
- Get lost!
- I will bring her

402
00:21:25,901 --> 00:21:28,295
Pugazh, there's a bag in
that room for the past 4 days

403
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,160
- Whose is it?
- Venkat's, ma

404
00:21:32,301 --> 00:21:34,781
He promised to come on the 5th
Today is the 10th

405
00:21:34,821 --> 00:21:35,727
No sign of him

406
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,352
His phone is switched off

407
00:21:37,501 --> 00:21:39,981
As soon as your son gets back
ask him to meet me

408
00:21:44,901 --> 00:21:46,141
Who is this man?

409
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:47,941
How many people
has he borrowed from?

410
00:21:47,981 --> 00:21:49,597
As if borrowing from
the locals isn't enough...

411
00:21:49,622 --> 00:21:51,102
...he has borrowed
from out-of-towners too!

412
00:21:51,239 --> 00:21:53,479
If he had taken us into confidence
we could've tried to solve it

413
00:21:53,661 --> 00:21:56,141
He has a king sized ego
Look how you've raised your son!

414
00:21:56,861 --> 00:21:57,661
Come in

415
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:59,281
Know what your friend
has been up to

416
00:21:59,328 --> 00:22:00,048
What happened?

417
00:22:00,144 --> 00:22:03,424
Doesn't he wake up at
4:30 a.m and go to the shop?

418
00:22:03,581 --> 00:22:06,812
If I tell your precious son to
be in the shop at lunchtime...

419
00:22:06,837 --> 00:22:07,557
...he doesn't show up

420
00:22:07,615 --> 00:22:09,815
It's beneath his dignity
to work in a timber depot

421
00:22:09,893 --> 00:22:10,893
What happened?

422
00:22:10,965 --> 00:22:12,525
Don't know what's happening!

423
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:15,301
Past 2 days so many people
are at our doorstep...

424
00:22:15,326 --> 00:22:17,126
...claiming Venkat owes them money

425
00:22:17,409 --> 00:22:20,181
My husband has given whatever
money and jewelry we had

426
00:22:20,261 --> 00:22:21,781
Venkat has been
missing for 3 days

427
00:22:21,836 --> 00:22:23,276
I told my husband
to go and look for him

428
00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:24,701
He's raising his hands at me

429
00:22:24,866 --> 00:22:27,386
I'm scared he'll harm himself

430
00:22:27,816 --> 00:22:30,456
Won't he take care of himself?

431
00:22:30,497 --> 00:22:32,657
Be brave
I'll go and get him

432
00:22:33,581 --> 00:22:34,581
Is that so?

433
00:22:34,661 --> 00:22:36,025
Did you enquire properly?

434
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:37,090
Did you check with Karthi?

435
00:22:37,115 --> 00:22:38,195
Check and call me back

436
00:22:39,421 --> 00:22:40,941
I knew this was coming

437
00:22:41,175 --> 00:22:43,100
When we aren't there
he'll be gambling away to glory

438
00:22:43,141 --> 00:22:44,101
As if that's priority now!

439
00:22:44,257 --> 00:22:45,457
You'll rush to his defense!

440
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:46,159
What, da?

441
00:22:46,246 --> 00:22:48,166
Spoke to Arcot Babu
I believe he didn't go there

442
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:50,701
Shall I check with Akbar?

443
00:22:51,101 --> 00:22:52,242
Where could he have gone?

444
00:22:52,267 --> 00:22:53,467
Checked with Arakkonam boys

445
00:22:53,621 --> 00:22:55,101
But no one knows
his whereabouts

446
00:22:55,501 --> 00:22:56,821
Do you know Vellore Seenu's number?

447
00:22:56,861 --> 00:23:00,021
Is this some gang culture?
Don't have any of their numbers

448
00:23:00,182 --> 00:23:01,661
You go with Kalai
to Kanchipuram

449
00:23:01,701 --> 00:23:03,421
I'll go to Vellore
and check with Seenu

450
00:23:03,461 --> 00:23:05,941
- Give me money for petrol
- Don't be so cheap

451
00:23:06,231 --> 00:23:08,271
You're decent, right?
Give me money for fuel

452
00:23:22,781 --> 00:23:24,781
- What brings You here, Pugazh?
- Did Venkat come here?

453
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:26,445
He came yesterday
Stayed in the warehouse

454
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:27,830
Left for Chittoor this morning

455
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:30,021
Any problems at his place?

456
00:23:30,061 --> 00:23:31,501
He didn't tell me
when I asked him either

457
00:23:31,581 --> 00:23:33,821
- Why don't you come in?
- No, it's okay

458
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:42,621
- Pugazh, How are you?
- I'm fine

459
00:23:42,828 --> 00:23:44,828
- Did Venkat come here?
- No, he didn't

460
00:23:44,853 --> 00:23:46,021
Any problem?

461
00:23:46,392 --> 00:23:48,227
For past 2 days he hasn't
been coming to our area

462
00:23:48,252 --> 00:23:49,732
Can you call and
check with our boys?

463
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:51,402
I'll check
Sit down

464
00:24:03,661 --> 00:24:04,221
Tell me

465
00:24:04,261 --> 00:24:06,061
My uncle had gone
to Thiruttani yesterday

466
00:24:06,101 --> 00:24:07,901
I believe he saw Venkat there

467
00:24:30,141 --> 00:24:33,021
'Praise be to Lord Muruga'

468
00:25:13,461 --> 00:25:14,501
Hey!

469
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,541
What are you doing here?

470
00:25:19,901 --> 00:25:21,501
First get dressed

471
00:25:23,312 --> 00:25:24,912
- Sit
- Where to?

472
00:25:24,975 --> 00:25:26,901
- Back home, of course
- I'm not coming

473
00:25:26,941 --> 00:25:28,181
- You go
- Then...?

474
00:25:28,221 --> 00:25:29,501
Where do you intend going?

475
00:25:29,874 --> 00:25:30,994
Sit

476
00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:32,299
No, I feel terrible

477
00:25:32,324 --> 00:25:34,324
People I borrowed from
are treating me like dirt

478
00:25:34,781 --> 00:25:36,461
Naturally!
They will ask you

479
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:37,821
You should face your problems

480
00:25:37,861 --> 00:25:39,101
If you run away like this-

481
00:25:40,061 --> 00:25:42,061
You could have
at least told me

482
00:25:42,101 --> 00:25:43,541
5 or 10 bucks
it's alright

483
00:25:43,581 --> 00:25:44,821
But it's gone beyond all that

484
00:25:44,861 --> 00:25:46,541
I've already borrowed
too much from you

485
00:25:47,541 --> 00:25:49,341
Sit, we'll deal with
whatever hassles

486
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,461
The creditors-

487
00:25:50,501 --> 00:25:53,341
Did they give you free money?
You're paying interest, right?

488
00:25:53,421 --> 00:25:55,421
Whatever it is
we'll handle it

489
00:26:02,076 --> 00:26:04,636
Pull over to the kerb, I'll get off

490
00:26:04,661 --> 00:26:06,661
Where do you intend
going from here?

491
00:26:06,874 --> 00:26:08,634
I'll drop you at home, sit

492
00:26:08,659 --> 00:26:10,979
I won't be able to face
my father if I go home

493
00:26:11,004 --> 00:26:13,436
That's okay
We can handle all that

494
00:26:13,461 --> 00:26:14,981
Listen to me

495
00:26:16,396 --> 00:26:18,796
You don't want to
go home, that's all?

496
00:26:18,821 --> 00:26:21,101
- You don't understand my plight
- Will you sit?

497
00:26:27,625 --> 00:26:29,948
People who bought
from me cheated me

498
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:32,101
Gratitude, loyalty, sentiment

499
00:26:32,141 --> 00:26:33,381
All that's dead and gone

500
00:26:34,765 --> 00:26:36,141
Why are you whining?

501
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:37,821
Drink up
We'll leave

502
00:26:40,507 --> 00:26:42,027
It all boils down to money

503
00:26:42,181 --> 00:26:46,141
Without that mother, father,
brothers, friends-

504
00:26:46,741 --> 00:26:49,541
Sorry, I mean everyone

505
00:26:49,581 --> 00:26:52,141
You gambled away all the money

506
00:26:52,181 --> 00:26:54,381
Why are you blaming
your parents and friends?

507
00:26:55,461 --> 00:26:57,501
See the creditors are here

508
00:26:57,541 --> 00:26:59,541
That's why I told you
I won't come back with you

509
00:27:00,181 --> 00:27:02,821
Only I know
you're back in town

510
00:27:02,861 --> 00:27:04,901
You don't understand
They will rip me apart

511
00:27:04,981 --> 00:27:06,381
I'll find out who they are

512
00:27:06,421 --> 00:27:07,581
Stretch and hold firmly

513
00:27:07,621 --> 00:27:08,501
Show the light here

514
00:27:08,541 --> 00:27:09,541
- 14
- Okay

515
00:27:09,581 --> 00:27:10,661
Okay, come

516
00:27:10,941 --> 00:27:12,901
Who are you and
what are you measuring?

517
00:27:12,941 --> 00:27:13,901
Who are you, sonny?

518
00:27:13,941 --> 00:27:16,154
You are measuring our ground
and you want to know who I am!

519
00:27:16,221 --> 00:27:17,221
Your ground?

520
00:27:17,467 --> 00:27:19,421
You're behaving like
it is your hereditary property?

521
00:27:19,461 --> 00:27:22,341
Bro, they are surveyors

522
00:27:22,381 --> 00:27:25,621
They are here to do their job
Please carry on with yours

523
00:27:25,701 --> 00:27:28,061
Never seen them
before in our town?

524
00:27:28,101 --> 00:27:30,021
Pugazh, what are they measuring?

525
00:27:30,195 --> 00:27:32,781
They are measuring something
but not giving me a proper answer

526
00:27:32,821 --> 00:27:34,381
By the way, who are you?

527
00:27:34,501 --> 00:27:35,781
How does it matter to you?

528
00:27:35,861 --> 00:27:37,901
Pugazh, who are they?
What are they doing?

529
00:27:37,981 --> 00:27:40,701
I don't know, but they've been
measuring for quite sometime

530
00:27:40,741 --> 00:27:41,981
We were sitting there

531
00:27:42,021 --> 00:27:43,981
When I asked them,
they said they are surveyors

532
00:27:44,021 --> 00:27:45,701
- We don't know why
- What are they measuring?

533
00:27:45,781 --> 00:27:48,621
Shall we go and enquire
in our municipality office?

534
00:27:50,061 --> 00:27:51,421
Get hold of him

535
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:55,061
You spoke as if the whole town
is under your control?

536
00:27:55,141 --> 00:27:57,181
And one nonentity is creating trouble

537
00:27:57,221 --> 00:27:59,581
Your men were standing
quietly there and watching

538
00:27:59,613 --> 00:28:02,813
Did I send you there
just to stand and gape?

539
00:28:02,901 --> 00:28:04,581
If someone came,
you should've hit him

540
00:28:04,637 --> 00:28:06,317
How could I?
It was Pugazh who came

541
00:28:06,381 --> 00:28:06,941
Who?

542
00:28:07,021 --> 00:28:09,884
That flower wholesaler Sadasivan
His 2nd son, Pugazh

543
00:28:09,909 --> 00:28:10,909
Why did he come there?

544
00:28:10,934 --> 00:28:12,454
I think he was drinking
in that ground

545
00:28:12,549 --> 00:28:13,869
He saw our men and
questioned them

546
00:28:13,941 --> 00:28:15,501
He has a knack of
attracting a crowd!

547
00:28:15,541 --> 00:28:17,021
Who is that Pugazh?

548
00:28:17,253 --> 00:28:18,381
Lives in our area

549
00:28:18,604 --> 00:28:19,581
Little bit of a smart Alec!

550
00:28:19,621 --> 00:28:22,541
- Uncle, This is Vishnu
- Yes, What happened?

551
00:28:22,581 --> 00:28:24,661
People crowded around
So it became a problem

552
00:28:24,701 --> 00:28:25,781
Let me speak to Das

553
00:28:26,531 --> 00:28:27,291
My father-in-law

554
00:28:27,316 --> 00:28:28,236
Why bother him?

555
00:28:28,338 --> 00:28:29,938
We can finish the job
and talk, right?

556
00:28:29,963 --> 00:28:30,803
Talk to him

557
00:28:32,424 --> 00:28:33,676
Tell me, what happened?

558
00:28:33,701 --> 00:28:35,541
Nothing much
They are our area boys

559
00:28:35,581 --> 00:28:37,821
They were drinking I guess
So a big crowd gathered

560
00:28:37,901 --> 00:28:38,861
If you are in a rush...

561
00:28:39,469 --> 00:28:41,581
...you know the land near
the graveyard en route to Annadhalai

562
00:28:41,621 --> 00:28:43,541
About 15 to 20 acres
of land behind that area

563
00:28:43,581 --> 00:28:44,477
I can clinch it for you

564
00:28:44,502 --> 00:28:46,782
If you dig a bore well for 900 feet there
you will get only smoke

565
00:28:46,886 --> 00:28:49,686
I'm telling you I need land closer to
Palar river, adjacent to the highway

566
00:28:49,711 --> 00:28:51,271
Okay, bro, I'll finalize this

567
00:28:51,381 --> 00:28:53,821
Let the municipal election be over,
I'll clinch the deal then

568
00:28:53,861 --> 00:28:55,741
Let me talk to Vishnu

569
00:28:55,781 --> 00:28:58,421
- Give him some money
- Okay, I'll take care

570
00:28:59,421 --> 00:29:00,571
- Here
- What's it?

571
00:29:00,596 --> 00:29:01,156
Money

572
00:29:01,261 --> 00:29:03,221
Uncle asked you to keep it
for election expenses

573
00:29:03,261 --> 00:29:06,181
Is that so?
I'm very happy

574
00:29:13,261 --> 00:29:14,421
Wear this one

575
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:16,141
How long will you be
in the same shirt?

576
00:29:18,461 --> 00:29:20,861
I don't want to go, that man
will bring the roof down

577
00:29:20,901 --> 00:29:22,781
He's bound to be angry
because he hasn't paid up

578
00:29:22,821 --> 00:29:24,861
You don't talk back
I'll take care

579
00:29:26,341 --> 00:29:27,781
Keep going
I'll join you

580
00:29:28,109 --> 00:29:29,541
When can you remove your bandage?

581
00:29:29,581 --> 00:29:31,141
At this age, instead of staying at home...

582
00:29:31,181 --> 00:29:32,563
...why are you taking part in protests?

583
00:29:32,758 --> 00:29:34,398
- Can stay at home, no?
- Forget that

584
00:29:34,501 --> 00:29:36,381
Someone measured
the ground last night

585
00:29:36,421 --> 00:29:37,661
- Who was it?
- Don't know

586
00:29:37,701 --> 00:29:40,381
Before I could ask, they got
into the car and escaped

587
00:29:40,421 --> 00:29:42,741
From when I heard about it,
I'm not feeling good

588
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:46,021
They must have thought they can
encroach as no one owns it

589
00:29:46,061 --> 00:29:49,181
That playground has been used
for generations by our people

590
00:29:49,212 --> 00:29:50,852
You are finding fault
with me protesting

591
00:29:50,973 --> 00:29:53,213
Only because people like me hold flags...

592
00:29:53,261 --> 00:29:55,011
...some of these places
are still part of our heritage

593
00:29:55,036 --> 00:29:57,036
Otherwise they would've plotted
all of it and sold it long ago

594
00:29:57,061 --> 00:29:59,901
Why are you tense, uncle?
As if we would let it happen!

595
00:30:00,581 --> 00:30:01,901
Don't know if you can deal with it

596
00:30:01,981 --> 00:30:02,661
I'll come back

597
00:30:02,701 --> 00:30:03,541
Then-

598
00:30:03,925 --> 00:30:05,301
I'll take a shower and come

599
00:30:05,341 --> 00:30:06,839
Let's lodge a complaint
to be on the safe side

600
00:30:06,952 --> 00:30:09,032
Venkat and I are going
I will send Kalai

601
00:30:09,221 --> 00:30:10,461
Derided all of you as lazy louts

602
00:30:10,501 --> 00:30:11,141
About me too?

603
00:30:11,181 --> 00:30:13,741
Get inside
Why are you gossiping?

604
00:30:13,821 --> 00:30:15,261
What were you talking about?

605
00:30:15,301 --> 00:30:16,501
I'm really ashamed

606
00:30:16,541 --> 00:30:17,381
Why?

607
00:30:17,621 --> 00:30:18,421
That Bhuvana-

608
00:30:18,461 --> 00:30:19,101
Watch out

609
00:30:19,141 --> 00:30:20,701
She has spoken
ill of us to your sister

610
00:30:20,741 --> 00:30:21,581
What did she say?

611
00:30:21,621 --> 00:30:22,581
We are all lazy louts

612
00:30:22,732 --> 00:30:24,756
Jobless and eating out
of our fathers' savings

613
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:25,501
She's right

614
00:30:25,541 --> 00:30:27,741
You are always behind girls

615
00:30:27,781 --> 00:30:30,781
This one hasn't graduated
for the past 4 years

616
00:30:30,821 --> 00:30:33,261
He has loans all over the place
Naturally she will deride us

617
00:30:33,356 --> 00:30:35,596
- I'm a very good boy
- You're the laziest lout of the whole lot

618
00:30:35,621 --> 00:30:36,821
Sir, what about you?

619
00:30:36,861 --> 00:30:38,461
I won't fall under
your category

620
00:30:38,501 --> 00:30:40,381
I am so busy know
Everyday flower

621
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:41,541
Go to the shop in the morning

622
00:30:41,581 --> 00:30:42,701
Full business dude

623
00:30:42,821 --> 00:30:44,021
Sorry miss

624
00:30:44,165 --> 00:30:47,691
If you come up with your stories
to these tuition kids again...

625
00:30:47,716 --> 00:30:48,916
...I'll rip you apart

626
00:30:48,941 --> 00:30:50,381
She didn't say
anything about me

627
00:30:50,501 --> 00:30:51,541
Uncle

628
00:30:51,581 --> 00:30:53,861
- What happened?
- That teacher is hitting me

629
00:30:53,886 --> 00:30:56,126
If you also join that group...

630
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:58,062
...you'll also be selling flowers
by the cubit like your uncle

631
00:30:58,087 --> 00:31:00,007
I don't measure flowers

632
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:00,880
Wholesale dealer

633
00:31:01,029 --> 00:31:03,149
As if you're a big Nokia dealer!

634
00:31:03,421 --> 00:31:04,301
What's with her?

635
00:31:04,341 --> 00:31:07,261
Thinks she is very witty
That's why she's on cloud 9!

636
00:31:07,301 --> 00:31:08,555
Why do you ask to be snubbed?

637
00:31:08,694 --> 00:31:09,814
She's our 'desi' Simon Cowell

638
00:31:09,902 --> 00:31:11,422
When did I argue?
All because of him

639
00:31:11,541 --> 00:31:12,941
Go home

640
00:31:12,981 --> 00:31:14,141
Watch your step

641
00:31:14,221 --> 00:31:15,861
Hello Mani

642
00:31:15,901 --> 00:31:17,981
Did you get the load
of chrysanthemums?

643
00:31:18,021 --> 00:31:19,701
Not yet, I believe
it will take another hour

644
00:31:19,741 --> 00:31:20,741
- What?
- 1 hour

645
00:31:20,821 --> 00:31:21,821
Why 1 hour?

646
00:31:23,981 --> 00:31:27,527
I believe that military man has
settled his daughter's wedding

647
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:28,790
He wants us to decorate the hall

648
00:31:28,901 --> 00:31:31,381
Show him the designs
and ask him what he wants

649
00:31:32,101 --> 00:31:33,141
I'll come along with you

650
00:31:33,181 --> 00:31:33,948
Why?

651
00:31:33,973 --> 00:31:34,853
Let me come please

652
00:31:35,021 --> 00:31:36,861
If you come, you should
behave yourself

653
00:31:36,901 --> 00:31:38,661
I swear I'll be on
my best behavior

654
00:31:38,701 --> 00:31:39,781
I'll be in the ground

655
00:31:39,821 --> 00:31:40,661
Okay, da

656
00:31:41,781 --> 00:31:44,021
- Like this?
- Very nice

657
00:31:44,262 --> 00:31:45,461
Ask if she likes the design

658
00:31:45,501 --> 00:31:47,781
Vennila, how do
you like this design?

659
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:49,790
This one

660
00:31:51,781 --> 00:31:53,181
The rose design looks great

661
00:31:53,261 --> 00:31:55,581
For your complexion,
this design will look good

662
00:32:02,141 --> 00:32:03,341
How much is this design?

663
00:32:03,381 --> 00:32:04,575
Why are you
worried about that?

664
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,640
Just tell me
your preference

665
00:32:05,665 --> 00:32:07,105
I'll discuss the rate
with your father

666
00:32:10,421 --> 00:32:13,221
For your complexion
the red rose decor won't work

667
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:17,839
If you choose white jasmine
it will be soooper

668
00:32:18,873 --> 00:32:21,193
- Right, da?
- Sit here

669
00:32:22,781 --> 00:32:24,741
Mother, you select please

670
00:32:26,229 --> 00:32:27,309
Won't you be quiet?

671
00:32:27,334 --> 00:32:29,254
I'm unable to select from this

672
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,910
She's asking us to choose

673
00:32:31,221 --> 00:32:32,141
Tell me what you like

674
00:32:32,181 --> 00:32:34,301
What color is your sari
for the evening?

675
00:32:35,021 --> 00:32:36,821
- This looks great, right?
- I agree

676
00:32:36,861 --> 00:32:37,861
Go out now

677
00:32:38,541 --> 00:32:39,741
Out, I said

678
00:32:45,861 --> 00:32:47,301
1 cigarette, bro

679
00:32:55,963 --> 00:32:56,381
Select one

680
00:32:56,461 --> 00:32:58,021
There are many designs
to choose from, dear

681
00:32:58,061 --> 00:33:00,661
- Dude, come out
- What for?

682
00:33:01,461 --> 00:33:03,261
- Sir, I'll be right back
- Okay

683
00:33:04,661 --> 00:33:07,181
- Why did you call me out?
- Just come

684
00:33:07,981 --> 00:33:09,901
- I think she is a very lucky
- Obviously

685
00:33:10,781 --> 00:33:13,141
Your girl is talking
to some stranger!

686
00:33:15,301 --> 00:33:17,981
He looks real smart
and dressed to kill

687
00:33:18,165 --> 00:33:19,901
- Tell me now
- Any problem?

688
00:33:19,941 --> 00:33:21,581
Nothing
No problem

689
00:33:21,621 --> 00:33:23,141
You asked me to
step out to see this?

690
00:33:23,181 --> 00:33:24,661
- What?
- Come

691
00:33:24,701 --> 00:33:25,901
Tell me you aren't affected

692
00:33:25,981 --> 00:33:27,101
Nothing at all

693
00:33:27,621 --> 00:33:30,412
And we were like circus clowns
circling in our bikes at her doorstep!

694
00:33:30,457 --> 00:33:31,857
- What?
- Nothing

695
00:33:33,581 --> 00:33:35,901
Could he be a friend?

696
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:37,541
How does it matter?

697
00:33:37,581 --> 00:33:39,541
Anyway you aren't affected at all

698
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:43,150
Where are you?

699
00:33:45,261 --> 00:33:46,541
Who is this?

700
00:33:47,539 --> 00:33:50,021
Venkat, after borrowing money
and now don't be unreachable

701
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:51,261
Where are you taking him?

702
00:33:51,301 --> 00:33:52,661
Stop butting in

703
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:54,021
Take your hands off me!

704
00:33:54,101 --> 00:33:56,821
Look, what's happening

705
00:33:56,861 --> 00:33:59,861
Venkat, get into the auto
Don't make any trouble

706
00:33:59,941 --> 00:34:01,421
I got in, right?

707
00:34:01,501 --> 00:34:02,661
Don't rough up my friends

708
00:34:02,701 --> 00:34:04,541
Drag him into the auto by force

709
00:34:04,661 --> 00:34:06,021
Come and ask him

710
00:34:07,101 --> 00:34:08,741
Why did you force him
into the auto?

711
00:34:08,821 --> 00:34:09,821
Pugazh, don't interfere

712
00:34:09,861 --> 00:34:11,430
My boss wanted me to bring him
You talk to him directly

713
00:34:11,585 --> 00:34:13,145
I'll bring him wherever
he needs to be taken to

714
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:15,256
Hey Pugazh, if you insist
then come with me

715
00:34:15,501 --> 00:34:16,581
Come out

716
00:34:16,661 --> 00:34:17,661
I'm telling you-

717
00:34:18,301 --> 00:34:19,421
Start the auto

718
00:34:19,461 --> 00:34:20,341
Take off your leg

719
00:34:20,421 --> 00:34:21,741
Why are you being a nag?

720
00:34:40,701 --> 00:34:42,141
Watch your back

721
00:34:47,501 --> 00:34:48,621
Let's go

722
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:58,125
You're going overboard, Pugazh

723
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:00,110
He is the one who lent him money
That's why I sent my men

724
00:35:00,175 --> 00:35:01,135
Isn't there a decent way?

725
00:35:01,317 --> 00:35:04,197
You can't barge
into a football match

726
00:35:04,364 --> 00:35:05,621
He pushed him
into the auto

727
00:35:05,701 --> 00:35:06,941
I know what I'm doing

728
00:35:07,036 --> 00:35:09,316
Company is closed
His phone is switched off

729
00:35:09,476 --> 00:35:11,676
No one is in the house
I found out he's back

730
00:35:11,701 --> 00:35:13,501
I sent my men to bring
Venkat and father here

731
00:35:13,581 --> 00:35:14,861
But you hit my men

732
00:35:14,901 --> 00:35:15,941
Oh! He'll hit my friend

733
00:35:15,981 --> 00:35:17,701
And I should fold my hands
and keep quiet, huh?

734
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:19,661
You gave the money to him, right?
If he hasn't paid you...

735
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:21,101
...lodge a complaint
or file a lawsuit

736
00:35:21,196 --> 00:35:23,902
Besides running behind him,
you want me to waste time on a court case?

737
00:35:23,927 --> 00:35:25,447
So you'll use violence to mediate?

738
00:35:25,527 --> 00:35:26,967
Pugazh, be patient
Let's try to resolve this

739
00:35:27,101 --> 00:35:29,021
Don't get swayed
Ask him to complain

740
00:35:29,061 --> 00:35:30,719
Let's see if he can
get even 1 rupee back

741
00:35:30,776 --> 00:35:34,216
Think only you know to go to the police
Even he suggested that option

742
00:35:34,381 --> 00:35:37,133
I decided otherwise because
he will feel humiliated

743
00:35:37,158 --> 00:35:39,238
Instead of defending him
ask him to pay me instead

744
00:35:39,421 --> 00:35:40,899
Give us some time
We'll definitely pay up

745
00:35:41,031 --> 00:35:42,591
He cannot leave
without paying up

746
00:35:42,693 --> 00:35:44,133
What will you do
if he leaves?

747
00:35:44,214 --> 00:35:45,334
Pugazh, wait

748
00:35:45,724 --> 00:35:46,796
How much does he owe you?

749
00:35:46,821 --> 00:35:49,101
He has borrowed 500000 and interest
is 200000, so total is 700000

750
00:35:49,141 --> 00:35:50,461
Why is interest 200000?

751
00:35:51,021 --> 00:35:51,981
Stay calm

752
00:35:52,318 --> 00:35:53,701
I don't have
that much on me now

753
00:35:53,741 --> 00:35:55,141
I can pay you in installments

754
00:35:55,221 --> 00:35:57,741
You can tell him to keep
my house documents as surety

755
00:35:59,874 --> 00:36:01,514
Then get the documents from him

756
00:36:01,546 --> 00:36:03,101
He'll collect it after
repaying the money

757
00:36:03,141 --> 00:36:05,581
You are giving in to their demands
It's an insane interest amount

758
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:07,581
What will they do if we
don't pay the interest?

759
00:36:07,621 --> 00:36:10,861
Please leave, I have to go through this,
for the sin of having him as my son

760
00:36:11,741 --> 00:36:14,421
Show me that one?
Isn't that beautiful?

761
00:36:14,461 --> 00:36:16,301
- Aiyaiyo!
- What?

762
00:36:16,421 --> 00:36:17,861
My brother saw me

763
00:36:21,661 --> 00:36:23,216
If I go home now,
I'm dead meat!

764
00:36:23,241 --> 00:36:24,041
Why?

765
00:36:24,197 --> 00:36:25,637
You have a bad reputation

766
00:36:25,701 --> 00:36:28,381
So he has told me
I shouldn't befriend you

767
00:36:28,821 --> 00:36:31,101
I know why he's mad at me

768
00:36:36,821 --> 00:36:38,461
Where did you go gallivanting?

769
00:36:38,501 --> 00:36:40,821
Went with Bhuvana akka
to the fancy store nearby

770
00:36:41,621 --> 00:36:43,381
Selvi, bring water

771
00:36:43,421 --> 00:36:44,901
Sister-in-law,
get him water please

772
00:36:44,941 --> 00:36:46,781
You go and give him water

773
00:36:46,828 --> 00:36:49,268
Selvi, I asked for
a glass of water

774
00:36:50,581 --> 00:36:53,018
Can't you hear him yelling?
He's asking for water

775
00:36:53,061 --> 00:36:54,941
I'm stringing the flowers
He asked her, right?

776
00:36:54,981 --> 00:36:55,981
Hey, you go

777
00:36:56,021 --> 00:36:58,221
I got the book you wanted
for Computer Science

778
00:36:58,261 --> 00:36:59,379
Check if this is the one

779
00:36:59,404 --> 00:37:01,524
You keep it there
I'll take it later

780
00:37:01,701 --> 00:37:03,301
Where's mother?

781
00:37:03,581 --> 00:37:06,301
She must have gone to consult
either a sage or an astrologer

782
00:37:06,341 --> 00:37:08,021
She will be seeking
blessings or predictions

783
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:12,201
I'm going to the store
Need anything?

784
00:37:12,226 --> 00:37:12,986
No, dear
Nothing

785
00:37:13,024 --> 00:37:14,224
Do you want anything, dear?

786
00:37:14,311 --> 00:37:16,231
Dad, I want an ice cream

787
00:37:16,381 --> 00:37:17,701
Okay, hold this

788
00:37:18,781 --> 00:37:21,199
Don't buy whatever he asks

789
00:37:21,256 --> 00:37:23,136
As it is, he has cavities

790
00:37:23,263 --> 00:37:26,303
Look who's talking!

791
00:37:29,181 --> 00:37:30,542
Trying to dodge me?

792
00:37:30,567 --> 00:37:31,767
Why would I do that?

793
00:37:31,792 --> 00:37:33,752
Didn't I warn you
not to go around with that girl?

794
00:37:33,901 --> 00:37:35,799
You are mistaken about her

795
00:37:35,824 --> 00:37:37,384
What did I think of her?

796
00:37:37,454 --> 00:37:39,534
You saw something
and thought something else

797
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:40,319
Sister-in-law

798
00:37:40,461 --> 00:37:42,538
Bhuvana akka's friend is
getting married it seems

799
00:37:42,563 --> 00:37:45,243
She came with her fiancé
to invite Bhuvana akka

800
00:37:45,461 --> 00:37:47,861
Sir saw him and
jumped to conclusions

801
00:37:47,901 --> 00:37:49,661
Why invite someone
in a coffee shop?

802
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:51,741
Can't he invite her at home?

803
00:37:52,501 --> 00:37:54,305
It's only 4 months
since he joined the party

804
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,398
You are giving him a seat

805
00:37:55,516 --> 00:37:57,356
I've worked for this party
for the past 20 years

806
00:37:57,381 --> 00:37:58,735
I will contest from
this 6th ward

807
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,760
If you want to contest, can you
spend that kind of money?

808
00:38:01,901 --> 00:38:04,021
Party head office has allocated
only Rs 20000 per ward

809
00:38:04,046 --> 00:38:05,126
How will that be enough?

810
00:38:05,245 --> 00:38:06,805
If he runs, he'll spend 1000000

811
00:38:06,861 --> 00:38:07,941
Can you do it?

812
00:38:07,981 --> 00:38:10,943
We have a letter from the head office
asking us to give him a seat

813
00:38:11,015 --> 00:38:12,215
Nothing can be done

814
00:38:12,309 --> 00:38:14,029
If you want,
contest in the 7th ward

815
00:38:14,054 --> 00:38:15,134
Acting funny?

816
00:38:15,261 --> 00:38:17,421
You want me to
end up a pauper?

817
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:19,981
If I ever step into
your party office...

818
00:38:20,021 --> 00:38:21,339
...hit me with your sandals

819
00:38:21,364 --> 00:38:23,604
I don't want to have
anything to do with you

820
00:38:23,781 --> 00:38:26,301
That's it
Leave me alone

821
00:38:26,901 --> 00:38:28,101
Anbu

822
00:38:30,272 --> 00:38:31,716
What, Das?

823
00:38:31,741 --> 00:38:34,501
When our party declared all shops
to be closed for a protest...

824
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:35,930
...who broke the shops in the night?

825
00:38:35,955 --> 00:38:37,275
You and me, right?

826
00:38:37,797 --> 00:38:40,077
When buses were burnt, we were
locked up in jail for 6 months

827
00:38:40,102 --> 00:38:41,382
And the police
broke our legs

828
00:38:41,501 --> 00:38:42,821
Where were these chaps then?

829
00:38:42,901 --> 00:38:44,541
I am well aware of all that
Just pipe down

830
00:38:44,621 --> 00:38:46,421
Leader, give his 'dhoti' back

831
00:38:46,461 --> 00:38:48,381
Takes it off happily
at the drop of a hat!

832
00:38:48,781 --> 00:38:49,781
Give this to him

833
00:38:50,753 --> 00:38:52,633
Announce the candidate
from the 7th ward

834
00:38:53,692 --> 00:38:56,221
Thinking of 'Canopy Palani'
for running in the 7th ward

835
00:38:56,261 --> 00:38:57,741
Does anyone have any objection?

836
00:38:57,781 --> 00:39:01,381
We lost the Chairman post last time
only because we lost in that ward

837
00:39:01,421 --> 00:39:04,071
How can you repeat the same mistake?
Select a better candidate, bro

838
00:39:04,096 --> 00:39:04,976
What do I lack?

839
00:39:05,321 --> 00:39:06,781
I'll spend for the election
by even selling my house

840
00:39:06,806 --> 00:39:09,366
Palani, don't think
I'm finding fault with you

841
00:39:09,461 --> 00:39:12,061
In that ward, we don't
even have 50 of our men

842
00:39:12,101 --> 00:39:14,341
Let's get a local candidate
He needn't be from our party

843
00:39:14,381 --> 00:39:16,861
Okay then, suggest a person

844
00:39:17,181 --> 00:39:19,901
How about Vellampatti Mahesh?
They have a clean 60% majority

845
00:39:19,981 --> 00:39:21,861
I cajoled him
even last time

846
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:22,901
But he refused

847
00:39:22,981 --> 00:39:24,341
As if you're oblivious to this

848
00:39:24,366 --> 00:39:25,622
If you want,
you try talking to him

849
00:39:25,647 --> 00:39:27,327
Okay, let us think
of someone else

850
00:39:27,581 --> 00:39:28,901
Suggest a name

851
00:39:29,141 --> 00:39:30,221
How about our Pugazh?

852
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:32,327
- Who?
- Mr Sadasivan's son

853
00:39:32,382 --> 00:39:33,382
That's a good idea

854
00:39:33,501 --> 00:39:35,221
Any hassle, he is
the 1st one to show up

855
00:39:36,341 --> 00:39:38,061
All that won't work

856
00:39:38,523 --> 00:39:39,581
Be practical

857
00:39:39,621 --> 00:39:40,749
Why not?

858
00:39:40,774 --> 00:39:44,214
Somewhere from the head office,
they will send in a list of names

859
00:39:44,262 --> 00:39:46,782
With no idea of the influence
or affluence of the candidate

860
00:39:46,807 --> 00:39:48,127
Only we know inside out

861
00:39:48,301 --> 00:39:50,741
Let Pugazh contest from that ward
We can win hands down

862
00:39:50,781 --> 00:39:52,461
What he says makes sense

863
00:39:52,501 --> 00:39:55,061
So you want a young
novice to stand?

864
00:39:55,141 --> 00:39:57,821
Das, don't bring your personal
anger into party decisions

865
00:39:57,861 --> 00:40:00,021
You know if he runs
we'll win 100%

866
00:40:00,046 --> 00:40:01,141
Then why hesitate?

867
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:02,686
Last time we lost only
because of that ward

868
00:40:02,711 --> 00:40:03,671
Don't you remember?

869
00:40:03,696 --> 00:40:05,896
If you can't do it, let us know
We will talk to him

870
00:40:17,821 --> 00:40:20,261
What are you doing here
not even coming home?

871
00:40:20,301 --> 00:40:21,421
Just like that

872
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:23,101
Your mother visited my place

873
00:40:23,141 --> 00:40:24,162
- What does she want?
- Don't know

874
00:40:24,187 --> 00:40:25,867
She wanted to talk
to you about something

875
00:40:26,015 --> 00:40:28,055
No need, if she hears my voice
she will start crying

876
00:40:28,461 --> 00:40:29,901
Please talk

877
00:40:34,288 --> 00:40:36,701
Kalai, what's the score?

878
00:40:37,821 --> 00:40:38,941
I'll come
Okay, ma

879
00:40:41,533 --> 00:40:43,613
- Here
- What did she say?

880
00:40:43,661 --> 00:40:46,741
She has her own problems

881
00:40:46,781 --> 00:40:48,981
I believe uncle, aunt,
Sandhya are all visiting us

882
00:40:49,021 --> 00:40:51,341
And if I'm not at home,
it will seem very odd

883
00:40:51,381 --> 00:40:53,341
We've already given
our house documents to him

884
00:40:53,381 --> 00:40:56,181
In another 4 months if I don't pay up
my family will come to the streets

885
00:40:56,221 --> 00:40:58,261
And they are making
wedding plans

886
00:40:58,341 --> 00:41:00,301
Pugazh, Das anna
wants to talk to you

887
00:41:01,461 --> 00:41:02,381
Tell me, anna

888
00:41:02,421 --> 00:41:04,101
Looks like
you're still angry

889
00:41:04,126 --> 00:41:05,461
No, not at all

890
00:41:05,541 --> 00:41:08,181
- Do you know why I'm here?
- Yes, I know

891
00:41:08,221 --> 00:41:09,890
People in the party
feel strongly about it

892
00:41:09,951 --> 00:41:11,671
I'm not interested
in contesting

893
00:41:11,812 --> 00:41:14,532
People are fighting over seats

894
00:41:14,581 --> 00:41:15,936
You're being so indifferent

895
00:41:15,999 --> 00:41:19,439
I don't have much faith
in politics or politicians

896
00:41:19,701 --> 00:41:21,421
People who tonsure
their heads in temples...

897
00:41:21,461 --> 00:41:22,901
...believe God will help them

898
00:41:22,941 --> 00:41:25,696
But people who vote don't even
have that belief in their candidate!

899
00:41:25,722 --> 00:41:27,762
If we have a problem
only we must handle it

900
00:41:28,275 --> 00:41:30,155
You seem very naive, my boy

901
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:32,196
I thought only Pugazh doesn't
know to use a golden chance

902
00:41:32,221 --> 00:41:33,421
But you are also like him!

903
00:41:33,476 --> 00:41:35,316
I don't want politics

904
00:41:35,341 --> 00:41:37,317
Tell me if there is
a way to earn money

905
00:41:37,396 --> 00:41:40,196
Other than politics which job
gives you instant cash?

906
00:41:40,221 --> 00:41:41,941
How do you think
I own all this?

907
00:41:42,039 --> 00:41:43,079
Thanks to politics only

908
00:41:43,221 --> 00:41:46,402
Tell your friends you'll be
contesting from the 7th ward

909
00:41:46,427 --> 00:41:47,347
Ask them to help you

910
00:41:47,541 --> 00:41:49,061
Don't worry, I'll take care
of all the expenses

911
00:41:49,101 --> 00:41:51,341
How can I contest
from the 7th ward?

912
00:41:51,381 --> 00:41:52,341
It isn't even my ward

913
00:41:52,381 --> 00:41:54,221
I know who should contest
from which ward

914
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:56,221
You can come out of
your financial mess...

915
00:41:56,261 --> 00:41:57,581
...only if you do
something like this

916
00:41:57,621 --> 00:41:59,661
He's willing to take care
of all the expenses, right?

917
00:41:59,701 --> 00:42:01,341
Can I go to him
for 5s and 10s?

918
00:42:01,381 --> 00:42:03,621
Why are you missing
a golden chance?

919
00:42:03,661 --> 00:42:05,501
I'm seriously discussing
Don't play the fool

920
00:42:05,541 --> 00:42:08,141
What do you mean 'don't play the fool'?
We are encouraging you

921
00:42:08,221 --> 00:42:10,181
If I run, who will vote for me?

922
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:12,893
- Naikar
- Tell me

923
00:42:12,941 --> 00:42:14,435
Won't you vote for Venkat
if he contests?

924
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:15,990
I'll vote for whomever
you ask me to, Pugazh

925
00:42:16,061 --> 00:42:18,221
- Then you won't take any bribe
- Be serious!

926
00:42:19,461 --> 00:42:21,461
Sudha, will you vote
for Venkat if he contests?

927
00:42:21,501 --> 00:42:22,981
I'll blindly follow
your suggestion

928
00:42:23,021 --> 00:42:23,821
Satisfied?

929
00:42:23,861 --> 00:42:25,981
She isn't even eligible to vote?

930
00:42:26,021 --> 00:42:27,501
Trust you to note all this!

931
00:42:28,662 --> 00:42:30,262
Give me 2 cigarettes

932
00:42:30,341 --> 00:42:31,541
No cigarettes here

933
00:42:31,581 --> 00:42:33,141
Let me get it from
the opposite shop

934
00:42:34,056 --> 00:42:36,016
Why are you
raising his hopes?

935
00:42:36,221 --> 00:42:38,301
I don't think
all this will work

936
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:40,476
He is negative by nature

937
00:42:40,501 --> 00:42:42,421
1st time in his life,
he is being positive

938
00:42:42,461 --> 00:42:43,261
We know he likes it

939
00:42:43,301 --> 00:42:44,861
We can face
whatever comes our way

940
00:42:44,981 --> 00:42:47,421
The election is round the corner
An expensive affair

941
00:42:47,461 --> 00:42:48,781
Keep this for now

942
00:42:48,821 --> 00:42:51,061
Next time I'll take on
the entire expenditure, okay?

943
00:42:52,061 --> 00:42:53,221
Thank you

944
00:42:53,661 --> 00:42:55,661
They think I own the quarry

945
00:42:55,701 --> 00:42:56,981
Only I know
I'm just a puppet

946
00:42:57,021 --> 00:42:58,021
I told you to ask him

947
00:42:58,061 --> 00:42:59,021
Ask just this time, ma

948
00:42:59,061 --> 00:42:59,901
You ask

949
00:43:00,061 --> 00:43:02,061
What are you both
muttering about?

950
00:43:02,101 --> 00:43:05,141
- Your son wants a bike
- I'll get him one soon

951
00:43:05,211 --> 00:43:06,851
Come up with some excuse or the other

952
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:08,436
He keeps bugging me

953
00:43:08,461 --> 00:43:10,381
Tell him a proper date
when you'll buy it

954
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:11,861
Why pay from our pocket?

955
00:43:11,901 --> 00:43:13,741
The Assembly election
is just a year away

956
00:43:13,781 --> 00:43:15,901
Like giving free cycle,
TV and computer...

957
00:43:15,941 --> 00:43:17,461
...they might also give
a bike as freebie

958
00:43:17,501 --> 00:43:19,621
I swear you're born
with the gift of the gab

959
00:43:19,661 --> 00:43:22,061
God knows where you get money
to donate to the temple...

960
00:43:22,101 --> 00:43:24,661
...or lavishly spend on wedding gifts
for Tom, Dick and Hari!

961
00:43:24,701 --> 00:43:27,501
But if our children want something
you'll come up with excuses

962
00:43:27,541 --> 00:43:28,901
If I don't do it
no one will respect me

963
00:43:28,941 --> 00:43:30,301
Bloody respect!

964
00:43:30,341 --> 00:43:34,261
Sekhar became a councilor and built
a house for himself in 2 years

965
00:43:34,301 --> 00:43:37,661
You sublet our rented house and
we are sitting in the terrace here!

966
00:43:37,701 --> 00:43:39,581
Easy for you to say
You are out most of the time

967
00:43:39,661 --> 00:43:40,981
Only we bear
the brunt of the sun

968
00:43:41,021 --> 00:43:42,621
- Is your father in?
- He's inside

969
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:43,861
Can't even buy
an air-conditioner

970
00:43:43,901 --> 00:43:45,621
Father, Palani anna is here

971
00:43:46,941 --> 00:43:48,261
Back again like a bad penny!

972
00:43:48,301 --> 00:43:49,541
Will you shut up?

973
00:43:50,621 --> 00:43:53,341
Palani, District collector said
he would be coming over

974
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:54,768
Open up the office
I'll be there soon

975
00:43:54,793 --> 00:43:55,553
Okay, bro

976
00:43:55,701 --> 00:43:56,621
Did you speak to Venkat?

977
00:43:56,661 --> 00:43:57,381
Yes, I did

978
00:43:57,627 --> 00:43:59,141
How can you think
he is qualified?

979
00:43:59,181 --> 00:44:00,821
You spoke to Pugazh
That was a good move

980
00:44:00,861 --> 00:44:02,141
Don't be a nitwit

981
00:44:02,343 --> 00:44:03,781
Pugazh and Venkat
make a duo

982
00:44:03,861 --> 00:44:05,861
They are real thick friends
from childhood

983
00:44:05,901 --> 00:44:07,901
So what, bro?
He isn't even in our ward

984
00:44:07,941 --> 00:44:09,741
How will the people in my street
vote for him then?

985
00:44:09,781 --> 00:44:12,818
Our party isn't a state or
central political party

986
00:44:12,843 --> 00:44:13,643
Purely caste oriented

987
00:44:13,814 --> 00:44:17,694
Only our men will vote if you or
anyone else stands in your ward

988
00:44:17,781 --> 00:44:19,141
You won't even get back your deposit

989
00:44:19,181 --> 00:44:21,221
But Venkat's story is different

990
00:44:21,436 --> 00:44:23,116
He is very friendly by nature

991
00:44:23,141 --> 00:44:25,421
He has nurtured a rapport
with all of them

992
00:44:25,565 --> 00:44:26,941
On top of it
Pugazh is his second skin

993
00:44:26,981 --> 00:44:27,981
What else do you want?

994
00:44:28,021 --> 00:44:29,078
Don't worry about any of this

995
00:44:29,103 --> 00:44:31,943
Once the election is over
I'll find you a good party post

996
00:44:32,181 --> 00:44:33,141
Leave now

997
00:44:45,196 --> 00:44:47,236
At least this time, will you
occupy the Chairman's seat?

998
00:44:47,261 --> 00:44:48,261
For sure, bro

999
00:44:48,581 --> 00:44:50,621
In 26 wards in this town
our flag flies uncontested

1000
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:52,086
We were unable
to hoist one here

1001
00:44:52,111 --> 00:44:54,151
We managed it here also
We will win definitely

1002
00:44:54,261 --> 00:44:56,701
Das, is the distribution of
money and gifts going smooth?

1003
00:44:56,741 --> 00:44:57,421
No, bro

1004
00:44:57,446 --> 00:44:59,006
Election commission is hawkeyed!

1005
00:44:59,101 --> 00:45:00,661
Police are swarming
all over the place

1006
00:45:00,701 --> 00:45:01,901
I am trying to do my best

1007
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:05,021
You're the reason
for our flag flying here

1008
00:45:05,061 --> 00:45:06,861
I just now said so
to our minister

1009
00:45:07,534 --> 00:45:09,901
Somehow stick to Venkat
and make him win, Pugazh

1010
00:45:10,096 --> 00:45:11,381
You focus on
some other ward

1011
00:45:11,421 --> 00:45:13,781
As far as this ward goes
he is the councilor

1012
00:45:24,701 --> 00:45:27,021
Bro, kindly remember
to vote for our Venkat

1013
00:45:27,101 --> 00:45:29,621
Pugazh, don't you know
your word is gospel to us?

1014
00:45:29,661 --> 00:45:31,901
That boy is already
a wasted wastrel!

1015
00:45:31,941 --> 00:45:33,341
Now he is stepping
into politics, huh?

1016
00:45:33,436 --> 00:45:36,356
At least you could have made him
stand in our ward, right?

1017
00:45:36,419 --> 00:45:38,779
Having sinned to be his parents,
we would have voted for him

1018
00:45:38,804 --> 00:45:41,044
Don't you worry about anything

1019
00:45:41,101 --> 00:45:42,701
Just watch how
we shape him up

1020
00:45:42,741 --> 00:45:46,261
"Not passed 2nd grade duly
Aspire to be a politician coolly"

1021
00:45:46,341 --> 00:45:49,381
"A corrupt mind wants to be
clad in crisp white shirt daily"

1022
00:45:49,421 --> 00:45:51,621
"Every election you'll stand
Our votes you'll demand"

1023
00:45:51,741 --> 00:45:53,461
Venkat, bring your ward list

1024
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:54,501
Hello, Pugazh

1025
00:45:54,541 --> 00:45:56,461
Give Pugazh 10 pieces

1026
00:45:57,371 --> 00:45:58,621
- Take, Pugazh
- For what, bro?

1027
00:45:58,646 --> 00:45:59,326
Gold coin

1028
00:45:59,351 --> 00:46:01,071
If I give in my ward
no one will accept, bro

1029
00:46:01,096 --> 00:46:02,176
Who will say no to gold?

1030
00:46:02,215 --> 00:46:03,175
Of course they will accept

1031
00:46:03,247 --> 00:46:04,007
You distribute it

1032
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:05,750
Bro, give the coins to him

1033
00:46:07,341 --> 00:46:09,821
'This is quite common
in politics, I say'

1034
00:46:19,821 --> 00:46:21,461
Hey! What are you doing?

1035
00:46:21,541 --> 00:46:23,861
With the election commission
hot on our heels...

1036
00:46:23,901 --> 00:46:25,781
...we'll be counting bars
with our families!

1037
00:46:25,861 --> 00:46:27,501
Why are you inviting trouble?

1038
00:46:27,541 --> 00:46:28,781
Keep this for now

1039
00:46:28,821 --> 00:46:30,501
Rest we will give you
the day before election

1040
00:46:30,581 --> 00:46:32,821
Don't get swayed over
by what others give you

1041
00:46:32,941 --> 00:46:36,101
Here you are, all yours
New bike worth Rs 85000

1042
00:46:36,141 --> 00:46:38,821
Madasami anna
20 votes in your family

1043
00:46:38,861 --> 00:46:41,341
All of you go and vote for
the axe symbol decisively

1044
00:46:41,421 --> 00:46:43,981
Not 1 vote should go amiss
That's why you got the bike

1045
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:47,901
My son has been asking me
for a bike for past 2 years

1046
00:46:47,941 --> 00:46:49,421
I'm unable to get him one

1047
00:46:49,741 --> 00:46:50,901
How ironical!

1048
00:46:51,658 --> 00:46:53,541
Hey! Why are you
unloading all this here?

1049
00:46:53,581 --> 00:46:54,461
Where else, bro?

1050
00:46:54,501 --> 00:46:56,341
You want to announce
to the whole world?

1051
00:46:56,381 --> 00:46:57,101
Take it to our quarry

1052
00:46:57,141 --> 00:46:58,901
You could have
allocated a ward for us

1053
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:00,421
We could have, friend

1054
00:47:00,541 --> 00:47:02,101
What will you do
with just a ward?

1055
00:47:02,141 --> 00:47:04,541
No one is qualified to stand
in your party is another matter

1056
00:47:04,581 --> 00:47:06,381
Who will foot the bill?

1057
00:47:06,541 --> 00:47:09,101
Uncle, steeped in your problem
don't forget to vote for him

1058
00:47:09,141 --> 00:47:11,781
He is part and parcel
of our party

1059
00:47:12,461 --> 00:47:16,181
Das, this is like selling ice to
the Eskimos, he is our boy!

1060
00:47:16,221 --> 00:47:17,821
Spend this time in other houses

1061
00:47:17,861 --> 00:47:20,261
Get the best out of your party
and make our boy win

1062
00:47:20,301 --> 00:47:21,821
Alright, Arasu
Glad to hear this

1063
00:47:21,916 --> 00:47:23,316
Don't harbor any ill feeling

1064
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:25,701
It is your responsibility
to make him win

1065
00:47:25,741 --> 00:47:27,830
At least shouldn't you
advise your son?

1066
00:47:27,901 --> 00:47:29,501
You think he will
heed my words?

1067
00:47:29,541 --> 00:47:30,697
Don't talk to me about him

1068
00:47:30,821 --> 00:47:34,061
My wife and I will vote for you
You can be assured of that

1069
00:47:34,196 --> 00:47:36,076
Arasu, why can't you advise
your brother properly?

1070
00:47:36,101 --> 00:47:38,021
They are canvassing
for that boy Venkat

1071
00:47:38,061 --> 00:47:39,461
How can you trust Das?

1072
00:47:39,501 --> 00:47:41,181
This won't work
What more can I say?

1073
00:47:41,221 --> 00:47:44,101
I've been a councilor for past 2 years
and attending funerals and weddings

1074
00:47:44,192 --> 00:47:46,101
Why is Pugazh poking his nose into this?

1075
00:47:46,156 --> 00:47:47,436
- I feel bad
- They are just boys

1076
00:47:47,461 --> 00:47:49,021
And doing this
in a playful manner

1077
00:47:49,076 --> 00:47:50,836
You're making a mountain
out of a molehill

1078
00:47:50,931 --> 00:47:52,211
Only his vote counts?

1079
00:47:52,298 --> 00:47:54,458
My mother, my wife and I can vote

1080
00:47:54,637 --> 00:47:56,981
Only you'll win this time
Go with confidence

1081
00:47:57,061 --> 00:47:58,821
Don't forget to
vote for Venkat

1082
00:47:58,941 --> 00:48:01,821
Aunt, vote for Venkat

1083
00:48:01,901 --> 00:48:03,021
Let's go to that house

1084
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:03,886
No, let's go there

1085
00:48:04,066 --> 00:48:05,346
She isn't even eligible to vote

1086
00:48:05,371 --> 00:48:06,531
What if she doesn't
have any vote?

1087
00:48:06,556 --> 00:48:07,436
She can canvas for us

1088
00:48:07,461 --> 00:48:09,861
If she does, she'll turn the voter
against us, she's such a shrew

1089
00:48:09,956 --> 00:48:11,356
Give me a pamphlet

1090
00:48:11,411 --> 00:48:13,011
Vote for Venkat without fail

1091
00:48:13,036 --> 00:48:14,796
Our names won't be listed here

1092
00:48:14,821 --> 00:48:17,581
The neighbors Gita and
her sister are out of town

1093
00:48:17,621 --> 00:48:19,061
You can vote in her sister's name

1094
00:48:19,101 --> 00:48:20,741
Ask her to vote
instead of Gita

1095
00:48:20,945 --> 00:48:23,421
My friends will be in the booth
You won't face any problem

1096
00:48:23,617 --> 00:48:25,305
You're asking me to do
an illegal proxy vote

1097
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:27,410
Won't you do even this for a friend?

1098
00:48:27,541 --> 00:48:29,061
Why should she take a risk
for your friend?

1099
00:48:29,101 --> 00:48:29,621
Shut up

1100
00:48:29,661 --> 00:48:31,701
She isn't here
on the election day

1101
00:48:31,741 --> 00:48:33,021
She'll be in Hyderabad
for an interview

1102
00:48:33,061 --> 00:48:35,221
Oh! Next time Venkat will
stand in Andhra Pradesh

1103
00:48:35,261 --> 00:48:36,261
We'll let you know then

1104
00:48:36,301 --> 00:48:37,181
Smart Alec!

1105
00:48:38,381 --> 00:48:39,341
Let's get some crackers

1106
00:48:39,421 --> 00:48:42,101
Announcement of Ward #3 results

1107
00:48:42,181 --> 00:48:49,901

1108
00:48:50,621 --> 00:48:52,021

...has won by 128 votes
beating his opponent Sundaram

1117
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:28,101
Keep rocking!

1118
00:49:28,981 --> 00:49:31,141
You won just like you predicted

1119
00:49:31,166 --> 00:49:32,206

...by 647 votes

1122
00:49:39,399 --> 00:49:40,479
Super!

1123
00:49:40,621 --> 00:49:42,101
Congratulations, Venkat

1124
00:49:42,181 --> 00:49:43,261
You did it!

1125
00:49:43,341 --> 00:49:44,701
Careful

1126
00:49:46,061 --> 00:49:48,501
(jubilation over the results)

1127
00:49:49,821 --> 00:49:51,901
Don't tell anyone
your destination

1128
00:49:51,941 --> 00:49:53,861
- You took the phones?
- I did, bro

1129
00:49:53,901 --> 00:49:55,701
Whoever asks
just comply

1130
00:49:55,741 --> 00:49:57,675
Be it liquor or whore
Whatever the demand

1131
00:49:57,710 --> 00:49:59,310
Bring them when I tell you

1132
00:49:59,381 --> 00:50:01,745
More than them winning,
we must safeguard them

1133
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:02,730
That's priority

1134
00:50:02,806 --> 00:50:04,206
Don't keep them
in the same place

1135
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:05,403
They will track
and find out

1136
00:50:05,454 --> 00:50:06,774
Keep changing the hideout daily

1137
00:50:06,799 --> 00:50:09,319
I'll make the arrangements
from here, okay?

1138
00:50:14,332 --> 00:50:15,606
Maintain proper accounts

1139
00:50:15,631 --> 00:50:16,311
Leave now

1140
00:50:16,336 --> 00:50:18,056
- Vimala, keep an eye on this
- Okay, sir

1141
00:50:18,198 --> 00:50:19,558
I joined our party
before you did

1142
00:50:19,623 --> 00:50:20,663
And you don't trust me, Das

1143
00:50:20,702 --> 00:50:22,222
Everything is fine
Leave now

1144
00:50:22,247 --> 00:50:24,407
I have my own reasons
We'll deal with it later, go

1145
00:50:28,046 --> 00:50:28,966
Hey! Stop

1146
00:50:29,141 --> 00:50:30,981
Why has a rope been tied here?

1147
00:50:31,021 --> 00:50:33,781
- Okay, drop me here
- See you tomorrow

1148
00:50:36,375 --> 00:50:38,661
Hey! You got any brains?

1149
00:50:38,701 --> 00:50:40,701
Can't you see the rope
as a barricade?

1150
00:50:40,741 --> 00:50:41,791
You're crossing over blindly

1151
00:50:41,841 --> 00:50:43,881
You bet this is India-Pakistan border!

1152
00:50:44,101 --> 00:50:46,021
Look closely
You'll get enlightened

1153
00:50:53,901 --> 00:50:55,861
Now you know what border it is!

1154
00:50:55,901 --> 00:50:57,461
Razor tongue
of the first order!

1155
00:50:57,501 --> 00:50:59,141
That razor saved your life, right?

1156
00:51:05,781 --> 00:51:07,461
Bro, this is Pugazh

1157
00:51:07,821 --> 00:51:10,341
The electricity cable in
5th street has snapped

1158
00:51:10,381 --> 00:51:11,479
Will you come soon?

1159
00:51:11,504 --> 00:51:12,424
Okay, bro

1160
00:51:12,701 --> 00:51:14,181
Why get drenched?
Come inside

1161
00:51:14,221 --> 00:51:15,381
It's alright
I can manage

1162
00:51:15,421 --> 00:51:16,581
It's okay, come in

1163
00:51:31,261 --> 00:51:32,781
Isn't your brother at home?

1164
00:51:32,861 --> 00:51:34,861
My anna and his wife
have gone for a wedding

1165
00:51:34,901 --> 00:51:37,301
They may have got caught in this rain

1166
00:51:51,701 --> 00:51:52,821
Give it to me

1167
00:52:03,221 --> 00:52:04,941
Okay, I'll leave now

1168
00:52:04,981 --> 00:52:07,781
The Electricity Board
hasn't sent anyone as yet

1169
00:52:36,021 --> 00:52:38,661
I think the electrician is here

1170
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:40,750
See you, bye

1171
00:52:50,701 --> 00:52:52,341
Get him to talk

1172
00:52:53,221 --> 00:52:55,781
Balaji will try to worm out
news from you, careful

1173
00:52:56,174 --> 00:52:58,494
Looks like you joined
the Electricity Board

1174
00:52:58,519 --> 00:53:00,079
You are totally
mistaken about that girl

1175
00:53:00,181 --> 00:53:02,621
Very calm
and 24 carat gold

1176
00:53:02,878 --> 00:53:03,781
What's up?

1177
00:53:03,821 --> 00:53:06,221
This is what happens
when you fall in love

1178
00:53:08,061 --> 00:53:08,861
Jolly!

1179
00:53:08,901 --> 00:53:11,341
How indecent to
read my message!

1180
00:53:11,381 --> 00:53:12,461
Hey Pugazh

1181
00:53:12,861 --> 00:53:14,141
What, ma?

1182
00:53:14,407 --> 00:53:16,487
Selvi forgot to take 'kumkum'

1183
00:53:16,621 --> 00:53:19,141
- Give it to her please
- You're jobless, ma

1184
00:53:19,166 --> 00:53:21,246
Poor child has to walk
all the way back home

1185
00:53:21,474 --> 00:53:22,981
Let me go and
give it to her

1186
00:53:23,021 --> 00:53:24,310
Good Lord!
No need

1187
00:53:24,335 --> 00:53:25,255
I've turned over a new leaf

1188
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,520
- Don't believe me
- I'll be back now

1189
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:29,701
- Is she a child?
- Yes, to me she is

1190
00:53:29,741 --> 00:53:31,661
She will sell 2 towns in 2 seconds

1191
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:06,141
Why did you call me?

1192
00:54:08,485 --> 00:54:09,724
What is this for?

1193
00:54:09,781 --> 00:54:11,181
Give it to my sister

1194
00:54:25,261 --> 00:54:28,061
"Wow! Beauty beyond compare"

1195
00:54:28,101 --> 00:54:31,341
"Kidnapped by her looks extraordinaire"

1196
00:54:31,381 --> 00:54:37,661
"Her aura rips me apart somehow
Will I survive, I don't know"

1197
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:43,880
"Her eyes glow like the moon's beam
Her cheeks like the sun's rays gleam"

1198
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:48,985
"Her tresses like rain
I got lost in it in vain"

1199
00:54:49,181 --> 00:54:52,301
"When she laughs"

1200
00:54:52,901 --> 00:54:55,221
"I go to pieces in halves"

1201
00:54:55,341 --> 00:54:58,181
"Her graceful walk"

1202
00:54:59,101 --> 00:55:01,461
"Makes me want to stalk"

1203
00:55:01,541 --> 00:55:04,581
"Though I am well aware 'o"

1204
00:55:05,381 --> 00:55:07,661
"I fall into this love-mire, aiyo!"

1205
00:55:07,741 --> 00:55:13,701
"I'm trapped in this beautiful love"

1206
00:55:14,501 --> 00:55:20,341
"Wow! 'Beauty' gets a new meaning
Kidnapped by her beauty ravishing"

1207
00:55:20,381 --> 00:55:26,301
"Her looks pierce my heart with an arrow
Will I survive, I don't know"

1208
00:55:29,821 --> 00:55:30,901
Cooking gas?

1209
00:55:31,101 --> 00:55:33,061
Ask one of them

1210
00:55:45,181 --> 00:55:46,901
No, it's alright
I don't want

1211
00:55:56,821 --> 00:55:58,861
Wow! Super cool, eh?!

1212
00:55:59,541 --> 00:56:00,981
Don't you agree?

1213
00:56:03,101 --> 00:56:05,301
Tell her it's sooper!

1214
00:56:21,661 --> 00:56:27,501
"A string of words to express...I think"

1215
00:56:27,541 --> 00:56:33,661
"Seeing you, why do I sweat and blink?"

1216
00:56:33,701 --> 00:56:39,861
"Girl, your lovely eyes of fire
douse me in waves of desire"

1217
00:56:39,901 --> 00:56:43,581
"Ahaa this moment in time new
like an umbrella I bow to you"

1218
00:56:43,621 --> 00:56:45,661
- What?
- Look where the stump is!

1219
00:56:45,701 --> 00:56:51,741
"Like a swing let me be
on your ear lobe petite"

1220
00:56:51,781 --> 00:56:57,861
"On your ear lobe let me be the swing
swinging to and fro like your earring"

1221
00:56:57,901 --> 00:57:05,141
"Arrest me by the side of your ankle
Girl, like an anklet I'll gladly tinkle"

1222
00:57:07,781 --> 00:57:13,981
"Wow! Beauty beyond compare
Kidnapped by her beauty extraordinaire"

1223
00:57:14,021 --> 00:57:20,261
"Her beauty rips me apart somehow
Will I survive, I don't know"

1224
00:57:33,384 --> 00:57:35,184
Venkat is here

1225
00:57:35,224 --> 00:57:36,464
Ask him to come in

1226
00:57:40,261 --> 00:57:42,621
I trusted you and sent
the winning candidates with you

1227
00:57:42,646 --> 00:57:43,966
Why did you come
without telling me?

1228
00:57:43,991 --> 00:57:46,471
Munusamy anna asked me
to meet him at his place

1229
00:57:47,581 --> 00:57:48,501
What did he say?

1230
00:57:48,541 --> 00:57:49,522
He offered me money

1231
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:50,870
What did you reply?

1232
00:57:51,901 --> 00:57:54,037
Don't get lured by money
thinking you'll get a post

1233
00:57:54,062 --> 00:57:55,142
Only 2 more days left

1234
00:57:55,167 --> 00:57:56,912
Go, attend to them

1235
00:57:59,461 --> 00:58:01,661
He offered Rs 200000 in cash

1236
00:58:01,701 --> 00:58:02,781
So...?

1237
00:58:02,861 --> 00:58:04,221
Just informing you

1238
00:58:14,821 --> 00:58:18,461
Winning candidate of Ward #13,
Das of T.P.K party

1239
00:58:18,501 --> 00:58:22,541
Winning candidate of Ward #22,
M.K.Munusamy of M.P.K party...

1240
00:58:22,581 --> 00:58:24,501
...have filed their nomination

1241
00:58:24,821 --> 00:58:27,101
To choose the chairman
from these 2 candidates

1242
00:58:27,181 --> 00:58:30,741
...the Ward representatives
elected by the people

1243
00:58:30,781 --> 00:58:32,781
...will elect through secret ballot

1244
00:58:58,861 --> 00:59:02,701
The electoral officer will
announce the winner

1245
00:59:04,901 --> 00:59:08,581
T.P.K member Das got 14 votes

1246
00:59:08,621 --> 00:59:12,381
And beat Munusamy of M.P.K
party by 1 single vote

1247
00:59:12,421 --> 00:59:15,021
He is now the chairman
of Wallajah municipality

1248
00:59:15,101 --> 00:59:17,901
I declare this
as the official result

1249
00:59:18,341 --> 00:59:20,221
- Congrats
- Thank you, sir

1250
00:59:23,005 --> 00:59:24,341
I'm very happy

1251
00:59:26,766 --> 00:59:27,766
Greetings, bro

1252
00:59:27,861 --> 00:59:31,021
You've somehow wangled yourself
into the Chairman's seat of power

1253
00:59:31,061 --> 00:59:33,101
True, bro
I owe it to you

1254
00:59:33,141 --> 00:59:35,622
Do you remember
what I told you?

1255
00:59:35,717 --> 00:59:37,797
Of course, bro
That will be my 1st task

1256
00:59:37,861 --> 00:59:39,341
I am being tortured by my family

1257
00:59:39,421 --> 00:59:41,541
Being a minister and
incapable of even doing this

1258
00:59:41,566 --> 00:59:42,566
I'll handle it, bro

1259
00:59:42,661 --> 00:59:44,221
Don't worry, bro

1260
00:59:51,661 --> 00:59:53,301
- Hello, sir
- Greetings, sir

1261
00:59:53,341 --> 00:59:55,021
Did Vimala take good care of you?

1262
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:58,141
Both of you please wait outside

1263
00:59:59,861 --> 01:00:00,941
What's the progress, sir?

1264
01:00:01,181 --> 01:00:01,908
About what?

1265
01:00:01,933 --> 01:00:03,053
I told you about the playground

1266
01:00:03,086 --> 01:00:04,566
How do you think
I can help you, sir?

1267
01:00:04,591 --> 01:00:07,791
A complaint has already been filed
to find the encroaching party

1268
01:00:07,847 --> 01:00:09,807
I haven't taken any action
only because of you, sir

1269
01:00:09,941 --> 01:00:13,461
If we poke our nose further
the case will go up to the Collector

1270
01:00:13,501 --> 01:00:15,301
I will ensure there is
no pressure from your boss

1271
01:00:15,341 --> 01:00:16,568
You do as you please, sir

1272
01:00:16,676 --> 01:00:19,676
If anyone complains when you build,
I'll come to the spot and stop it

1273
01:00:19,701 --> 01:00:21,541
Build what you can
within that time frame

1274
01:00:21,581 --> 01:00:23,821
This is good enough
I'll take it from here

1275
01:00:25,181 --> 01:00:27,061
Venkat, come here

1276
01:00:28,461 --> 01:00:29,621
Is life treating you well?

1277
01:00:29,661 --> 01:00:32,461
What a question, bro?
I am on top of the world

1278
01:00:32,501 --> 01:00:35,903
All those who even sniggered at me
are now saluting me with due respect!

1279
01:00:35,928 --> 01:00:37,328
- Really?
- I am really happy

1280
01:00:37,501 --> 01:00:38,421
All that's fine

1281
01:00:38,461 --> 01:00:40,181
Let me introduce you to someone

1282
01:00:43,021 --> 01:00:44,461
Palani, step outside

1283
01:00:45,421 --> 01:00:46,981
This is Venkat

1284
01:00:47,061 --> 01:00:48,261
I spoke to you about him

1285
01:00:48,342 --> 01:00:50,902
Councilor who won by
the maximum margin in our district

1286
01:00:50,927 --> 01:00:51,941
Congratulations

1287
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:54,221
All credit goes to
my friend Pugazh, sir

1288
01:00:55,701 --> 01:00:57,821
Okay, go ahead with
your dinner, I'll join you

1289
01:01:16,421 --> 01:01:18,541
Do you know the man
I introduced you to just now?

1290
01:01:18,581 --> 01:01:19,141
Who, bro?

1291
01:01:19,181 --> 01:01:20,303
Son-in-law of
the Education minister

1292
01:01:20,399 --> 01:01:21,759
Millionaire in Andhra Pradesh

1293
01:01:21,830 --> 01:01:23,910
He's coming now
I'll discuss this with you later

1294
01:01:24,781 --> 01:01:26,305
Das, I'm leaving now

1295
01:01:26,330 --> 01:01:27,890
Call me when the party wraps up

1296
01:01:27,915 --> 01:01:29,795
A small token from me

1297
01:01:29,941 --> 01:01:31,341
- Why, sir?
- Just accept it

1298
01:01:33,501 --> 01:01:35,261
Why give me so much money?

1299
01:01:35,301 --> 01:01:36,323
You are very lucky

1300
01:01:36,348 --> 01:01:37,748
- Me?
- For sure

1301
01:01:37,901 --> 01:01:40,501
After our minister, you're the next
luckiest man I've met

1302
01:01:40,636 --> 01:01:43,156
10 years back
he was like you

1303
01:01:43,181 --> 01:01:44,741
Family problems
Financial hassles

1304
01:01:44,781 --> 01:01:46,381
He refused to stand
in the election

1305
01:01:46,421 --> 01:01:48,341
I arranged money
and made him contest

1306
01:01:48,661 --> 01:01:51,371
Do you know what
he is worth today?

1307
01:01:51,476 --> 01:01:52,716
Can't blame him

1308
01:01:52,741 --> 01:01:55,141
Shouldn't weigh pros and cons
once you get into politics

1309
01:01:55,181 --> 01:01:58,392
Look where my affiliation to caste,
community and friend has got me?

1310
01:01:58,461 --> 01:01:59,461
All gone for a toss

1311
01:01:59,501 --> 01:02:01,261
Must struggle to become a Chairman

1312
01:02:01,341 --> 01:02:05,341
Do you know how blessed you are
with the recognition you've got now?

1313
01:02:05,421 --> 01:02:07,780
Our leader wanted to
know who you are

1314
01:02:07,876 --> 01:02:09,156
I was myself shaken up

1315
01:02:09,181 --> 01:02:11,301
Only 2 points to become
a sought after politician

1316
01:02:11,341 --> 01:02:13,821
Good or bad, we should
keep hitting the headlines

1317
01:02:13,901 --> 01:02:15,781
And then money
If you have it, that's enough

1318
01:02:15,861 --> 01:02:17,301
Everything will fall into place

1319
01:02:17,341 --> 01:02:18,581
Just do what I say, Venkat

1320
01:02:18,621 --> 01:02:20,341
I'll make you a big shot in politics

1321
01:02:27,505 --> 01:02:28,941
He bought a mobile for Deepa

1322
01:02:28,981 --> 01:02:31,301
I'll buy you 4 beers
Ask him to deny this

1323
01:02:31,341 --> 01:02:33,821
Why is Logu calling
at this time of night?

1324
01:02:34,101 --> 01:02:36,701
Someone is building a wall
in our playground

1325
01:02:36,741 --> 01:02:38,021
Is that so?

1326
01:02:46,141 --> 01:02:47,221
Who are you?

1327
01:02:47,261 --> 01:02:49,421
Who authorized you to
build this wall here?

1328
01:02:52,741 --> 01:02:53,741
Who are they?

1329
01:02:53,781 --> 01:02:55,141
Don't know, the boys
called me just now

1330
01:02:55,221 --> 01:02:56,981
Do they think they can
get away with anything?

1331
01:02:58,598 --> 01:03:00,598
You don't know who I am
Just clear out of here

1332
01:03:00,701 --> 01:03:02,181
How does it matter
who you are?

1333
01:03:02,261 --> 01:03:03,021
Don't shout

1334
01:03:03,061 --> 01:03:05,141
Does your father own this?
Acting over smart

1335
01:03:08,301 --> 01:03:10,581
Just go, I am saying it
for your own good

1336
01:03:10,621 --> 01:03:11,861
Wait, let's find out

1337
01:03:11,901 --> 01:03:13,181
Who the hell are you?

1338
01:03:13,261 --> 01:03:15,221
Were you the ones
who measured here earlier?

1339
01:03:15,261 --> 01:03:16,421
Yes, I did
So what now?

1340
01:03:16,461 --> 01:03:18,861
Dude, ask them to leave
Or else it will become disastrous

1341
01:03:18,901 --> 01:03:20,381
I'm handling it, right?

1342
01:03:20,421 --> 01:03:21,181
Come this side

1343
01:03:21,261 --> 01:03:22,781
You act funny with me
you'll get it real hard

1344
01:03:22,821 --> 01:03:23,901
Why should we clear out?

1345
01:03:23,941 --> 01:03:25,341
Ask them to leave first

1346
01:03:25,381 --> 01:03:26,621
Why are you pushing us away?

1347
01:03:26,646 --> 01:03:27,526
Ask them to clear out first

1348
01:03:27,551 --> 01:03:30,191
If anyone intends
building anything here

1349
01:03:30,341 --> 01:03:32,021
...it will only be
over my dead body!

1350
01:03:32,061 --> 01:03:32,901
Get lost!

1351
01:03:32,941 --> 01:03:34,181
How dare you hit one of us?

1352
01:03:34,631 --> 01:03:36,341
Clear all this, or else
you're in for trouble

1353
01:03:36,381 --> 01:03:38,381
I won't clear out
What will you do?

1354
01:03:40,421 --> 01:03:41,581
Clear them out

1355
01:03:41,661 --> 01:03:43,061
Chase them out of here

1356
01:03:57,741 --> 01:03:58,821
Get him

1357
01:04:00,701 --> 01:04:02,461
Let's get the hell out of here

1358
01:04:20,221 --> 01:04:21,061
Let go of me

1359
01:04:21,101 --> 01:04:22,101
Let go

1360
01:04:26,141 --> 01:04:27,541
Pugazh, let go of him

1361
01:04:27,621 --> 01:04:28,941
Sir, get away from here

1362
01:04:29,021 --> 01:04:30,261
Leave this place, sir

1363
01:04:32,541 --> 01:04:34,181
Do you know who he is?

1364
01:04:34,261 --> 01:04:36,341
He is a minister's son-in-law

1365
01:04:36,381 --> 01:04:37,541
Not just him

1366
01:04:37,566 --> 01:04:40,806
If you intend doing something
to this ground, I'll hit even you

1367
01:05:04,661 --> 01:05:07,621
Das, don't just keep talking
I'll let out a string of cuss words

1368
01:05:07,701 --> 01:05:09,541
Who tried to hit
my son-in-law?

1369
01:05:09,581 --> 01:05:10,581
His friend

1370
01:05:10,621 --> 01:05:12,061
He became a councilor
because of him!

1371
01:05:12,101 --> 01:05:13,381
Is he such a big shot?

1372
01:05:13,741 --> 01:05:16,316
No way
Just a pipsqueak

1373
01:05:16,534 --> 01:05:18,061
That playground
is his usual haunt

1374
01:05:18,141 --> 01:05:19,381
When we showed
interest in it...

1375
01:05:19,421 --> 01:05:21,221
...he got mad and hit him
not knowing your power

1376
01:05:21,261 --> 01:05:23,821
If he's a nobody,
you should've hit back

1377
01:05:23,861 --> 01:05:25,181
Hitting him isn't a big deal

1378
01:05:25,321 --> 01:05:27,201
But many who belong to
his caste live in that area

1379
01:05:27,226 --> 01:05:29,786
If we harm him, they will
join hands with all the other parties

1380
01:05:29,918 --> 01:05:31,861
Then it will be a problem
for our construction

1381
01:05:31,941 --> 01:05:32,981
That's why I'm buying time

1382
01:05:33,061 --> 01:05:34,981
Don't give lame excuses, Das

1383
01:05:35,021 --> 01:05:39,181
The foreigner has tested
that water and approved it

1384
01:05:39,221 --> 01:05:40,181
Finalize the deal

1385
01:05:40,221 --> 01:05:42,581
But isn't the ground water
from the leather shop?

1386
01:05:42,621 --> 01:05:44,941
You know only about the water
below 30 or 35 feet

1387
01:05:44,981 --> 01:05:47,661
He has dug 100 to 150 feet deep

1388
01:05:47,701 --> 01:05:48,861
And has certified it

1389
01:05:48,901 --> 01:05:50,661
We can't change the place

1390
01:05:50,701 --> 01:05:54,061
If anyone creates problems,
use money as the trump card

1391
01:05:54,101 --> 01:05:55,221
That's not the point-

1392
01:05:55,261 --> 01:05:58,261
- Bro, I'll finish the deal
- What do you mean?

1393
01:05:58,341 --> 01:05:59,901
Sir is prepared to pay

1394
01:05:59,941 --> 01:06:01,381
I'll talk to Pugazh

1395
01:06:01,421 --> 01:06:02,781
Why do you hesitate?

1396
01:06:03,141 --> 01:06:06,661
He's saying he can do it
So clinch the deal now

1397
01:06:06,861 --> 01:06:07,941
Okay, bro

1398
01:06:09,501 --> 01:06:12,941
This is a hockey tournament
that took place in 1971

1399
01:06:12,981 --> 01:06:16,581
We were the winners
I was in high school then

1400
01:06:16,621 --> 01:06:18,781
The VIP presenting the award
is the Sports minister

1401
01:06:18,821 --> 01:06:21,061
The person next to him
is the district collector

1402
01:06:22,021 --> 01:06:24,501
This was taken in 1983

1403
01:06:24,541 --> 01:06:28,021
Foot ball tournament
held all over the state

1404
01:06:28,061 --> 01:06:31,981
This is proof to show that till date
our children play in this ground

1405
01:06:32,021 --> 01:06:33,701
All this is okay, sir

1406
01:06:33,741 --> 01:06:36,181
But I had asked for
the township's old layout

1407
01:06:36,221 --> 01:06:39,021
Village Administrative Officer,
Tahsildar, Collector

1408
01:06:39,053 --> 01:06:41,813
I've even sent a petition
to the Right to Information law

1409
01:06:41,838 --> 01:06:43,118
We will definitely get it

1410
01:06:43,181 --> 01:06:46,221
With all this information
we can file a writ in the court

1411
01:06:46,246 --> 01:06:48,286
But before the final judgment...

1412
01:06:48,381 --> 01:06:50,261
...I will certainly need
the papers I had requested

1413
01:06:50,301 --> 01:06:51,901
I'll somehow get them

1414
01:06:53,141 --> 01:06:55,581
Uncle, will this work?

1415
01:06:56,049 --> 01:06:58,541
What if the minister uses his power
and gets a title deed as owner of the land

1416
01:06:58,581 --> 01:07:01,461
Will we allow him to go that far?
Won't we protest?

1417
01:07:01,501 --> 01:07:03,376
Why are you worried?
Uncle is saying he'll take care

1418
01:07:03,401 --> 01:07:04,881
As if I have 2 horns!

1419
01:07:05,027 --> 01:07:07,267
Like you I'm also a common man

1420
01:07:07,292 --> 01:07:08,852
I know our people's weakness

1421
01:07:08,901 --> 01:07:11,221
If a man raises his voice
against a public issue...

1422
01:07:11,299 --> 01:07:13,851
...they'll make him a leader
and put him on a pedestal like God

1423
01:07:13,919 --> 01:07:15,879
They will give him
all the responsibilities

1424
01:07:15,904 --> 01:07:17,824
And will walk away
least bothered!

1425
01:07:17,910 --> 01:07:19,150
You must have
that fighting spirit

1426
01:07:19,261 --> 01:07:22,221
Only then you can question
these mistakes and stop them too

1427
01:07:22,261 --> 01:07:22,901
Imbecile!

1428
01:07:22,941 --> 01:07:25,821
Uncle, why take
my words so seriously?

1429
01:07:26,596 --> 01:07:28,756
Next game is which player
belongs to which team?

1430
01:07:28,781 --> 01:07:29,581
- Delhi
- Raina

1431
01:07:29,621 --> 01:07:32,381
Raina plays for
Delhi it seems!

1432
01:07:32,421 --> 01:07:34,381
- Punjab
- Yuvaraj

1433
01:07:35,021 --> 01:07:39,581
Hey Venky, modeling for
Ramraj 'dhoti' commercial!

1434
01:07:39,621 --> 01:07:41,381
- Keep quiet
- He looks very smart

1435
01:07:41,421 --> 01:07:43,181
Showing off your car-status!

1436
01:07:43,221 --> 01:07:44,221
I'm not showing off!

1437
01:07:44,261 --> 01:07:45,541
Came this side
on an errand

1438
01:07:45,581 --> 01:07:47,661
Knew all of you will be here
Just thought I'll drop by

1439
01:07:47,701 --> 01:07:50,021
- Give me a cigarette
- What a prompt request!

1440
01:07:50,061 --> 01:07:52,221
Get us a pack of cigarettes

1441
01:07:52,261 --> 01:07:55,101
You have an assistant
500 bucks for that...wow!

1442
01:07:55,141 --> 01:07:56,541
Mahesh, go and get it

1443
01:07:57,221 --> 01:07:59,821
You want to pull my legs,
do so when it is just our gang

1444
01:07:59,861 --> 01:08:00,901
Not in front of an outsider

1445
01:08:00,941 --> 01:08:03,221
- What did I say now?
- No decorum at all

1446
01:08:03,261 --> 01:08:05,821
Why are you scolding him?

1447
01:08:06,381 --> 01:08:08,661
Do you remember you got to
pay the loan tomorrow?

1448
01:08:08,701 --> 01:08:10,621
I have the money ready
Give it to him tomorrow

1449
01:08:10,661 --> 01:08:11,861
I paid him yesterday

1450
01:08:11,901 --> 01:08:13,701
- Full amount?
- Yes

1451
01:08:14,181 --> 01:08:16,541
If I had known a councilor
can make so much money...

1452
01:08:16,581 --> 01:08:18,021
...I would've become one myself!

1453
01:08:18,061 --> 01:08:19,821
You could've done that

1454
01:08:19,861 --> 01:08:22,301
Get the details of this ground
from the municipality office

1455
01:08:22,341 --> 01:08:23,348
Uncle has been
asking me for it

1456
01:08:23,373 --> 01:08:25,933
That's exactly why Das anna
asked me to bring you over

1457
01:08:25,958 --> 01:08:26,758
Why?

1458
01:08:29,927 --> 01:08:33,407
Don't go overboard
listening to that old man

1459
01:08:33,541 --> 01:08:34,781
Your life will be wasted

1460
01:08:34,861 --> 01:08:35,981
That man will even beg

1461
01:08:36,021 --> 01:08:37,581
But won't let anyone help him

1462
01:08:37,621 --> 01:08:39,381
You should come up well in life

1463
01:08:39,901 --> 01:08:42,981
Don't gang up with youngsters
And poke your nose into public issues

1464
01:08:43,021 --> 01:08:45,381
I'll pay you a lump sum of 200,000
Back off silently

1465
01:08:45,826 --> 01:08:49,141
I will get the municipality to change
the flower shop in your brother's name

1466
01:08:51,181 --> 01:08:52,421
Don't think

1467
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:54,999
I'll build a park in a corner
of the ground, okay?

1468
01:08:55,070 --> 01:08:56,230
What do you mean, bro?

1469
01:08:56,341 --> 01:08:58,941
If youngsters in our town
get good job placements...

1470
01:08:58,981 --> 01:09:00,981
...in Railways, TVS or Military
under the sports quota

1471
01:09:01,167 --> 01:09:03,051
...it's is only because
they practiced in this ground

1472
01:09:03,076 --> 01:09:05,076
If you want more youngsters
to come up in life...

1473
01:09:05,101 --> 01:09:06,461
...we need that ground

1474
01:09:06,501 --> 01:09:08,141
We don't need
a park to walk

1475
01:09:08,221 --> 01:09:09,741
But we need the ground to play

1476
01:09:09,886 --> 01:09:11,941
Don't talk without
knowing the details

1477
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:13,661
Do you know
who is behind this?

1478
01:09:13,894 --> 01:09:15,501
We can't fight against them

1479
01:09:15,541 --> 01:09:17,621
They will anyway take
that ground from us

1480
01:09:17,661 --> 01:09:19,581
We might as well get money
instead of having a raw deal

1481
01:09:19,621 --> 01:09:21,115
That's a sign of being shrewd

1482
01:09:21,268 --> 01:09:22,548
Don't be so cheap

1483
01:09:22,861 --> 01:09:25,284
Listen, if I am talking
to you all this while...

1484
01:09:25,334 --> 01:09:26,774
...it's only because
I respect your father

1485
01:09:26,861 --> 01:09:28,221
Safeguard that respect

1486
01:09:29,356 --> 01:09:31,076
If I choose to do it differently...

1487
01:09:31,101 --> 01:09:33,061
...I can do so without
spending a single rupee

1488
01:09:33,101 --> 01:09:35,501
I don't want to take that route
That's why you are here

1489
01:09:35,541 --> 01:09:38,101
- Are you threatening me?
- Take it that way

1490
01:09:38,821 --> 01:09:40,181
Then take your route

1491
01:09:40,781 --> 01:09:41,741
Hey! Listen

1492
01:09:41,781 --> 01:09:43,221
'Venkat, where are you going?'

1493
01:09:44,061 --> 01:09:45,021
Pugazh...?

1494
01:09:45,061 --> 01:09:46,861
- What?
- Wait

1495
01:09:46,901 --> 01:09:49,021
We both played as kids
in that same ground

1496
01:09:49,061 --> 01:09:51,061
Aren't you attached
to that ground at all?

1497
01:09:51,101 --> 01:09:52,181
I'm saying this-

1498
01:09:52,221 --> 01:09:55,421
Our fathers and grandfathers
grew up playing in that ground

1499
01:09:55,628 --> 01:09:57,341
How upset you were about
losing your house document?

1500
01:09:57,381 --> 01:09:59,101
Is our ground different
from your house?

1501
01:09:59,141 --> 01:10:00,981
You're doing sleaze jobs for them

1502
01:10:01,021 --> 01:10:02,008
Selling your soul for money

1503
01:10:02,033 --> 01:10:03,113
Get lost

1504
01:10:04,381 --> 01:10:06,741
'Venkat'

1505
01:10:10,891 --> 01:10:12,171
He thinks no end of himself?

1506
01:10:12,196 --> 01:10:14,316
Thinks people voted
for you because of him?

1507
01:10:14,341 --> 01:10:16,821
Is it enough if he tells people?
Who spent the money?

1508
01:10:16,861 --> 01:10:18,661
Don't go to that ward
until I tell you

1509
01:10:18,873 --> 01:10:20,113
Only then he'll realize

1510
01:10:21,861 --> 01:10:23,981
Took your own sweet time
to come? Where were you?

1511
01:10:24,021 --> 01:10:26,461
I got ready because you said
we could go for a movie

1512
01:10:26,541 --> 01:10:28,701
Why is this Venkat
behaving like a fool?

1513
01:10:28,741 --> 01:10:31,941
He's asking us to help
the minister seize the ground?

1514
01:10:32,587 --> 01:10:34,067
Plus he's trying
to grease our palms!

1515
01:10:34,092 --> 01:10:36,292
How much we struggled to
make him the councilor?

1516
01:10:36,317 --> 01:10:38,221
But he seems to
be scared of Das

1517
01:10:40,636 --> 01:10:42,756
He doesn't have
a mind of his own

1518
01:10:42,781 --> 01:10:45,341
Always being brainwashed
and making a mess of his life

1519
01:10:45,381 --> 01:10:47,701
You think he will prosper
because of Das?

1520
01:10:54,461 --> 01:10:56,461
I'm pouring my heart out
and you're so silent

1521
01:10:56,541 --> 01:10:58,061
I was nodding my head!

1522
01:10:59,901 --> 01:11:01,941
How stupid of me
to think aloud to you!

1523
01:11:02,821 --> 01:11:05,141
Ma, did you get back
my ironed clothes?

1524
01:11:05,181 --> 01:11:06,141
In comes the 'royal pain'!

1525
01:11:06,181 --> 01:11:08,021
He promised to
bring it this afternoon

1526
01:11:08,061 --> 01:11:09,781
Maybe he has
closed his shop

1527
01:11:09,821 --> 01:11:12,461
Why didn't you collect it?
I told you I'm going out

1528
01:11:12,501 --> 01:11:13,661
Why are you shouting?

1529
01:11:13,741 --> 01:11:14,541
Drink this

1530
01:11:14,581 --> 01:11:15,781
I'll go check
if he's still there

1531
01:11:15,821 --> 01:11:18,341
Where is Selvi?
Won't she get all this done?

1532
01:11:18,381 --> 01:11:19,821
You think she listens to me?

1533
01:11:19,876 --> 01:11:22,596
He won't sleep a wink
if he doesn't make me work

1534
01:11:22,621 --> 01:11:25,541
"Don't trust your eyes ever"

1535
01:11:25,581 --> 01:11:27,301
He thinks he is
MGR or what?

1536
01:11:27,341 --> 01:11:29,741
What's wrong with my brother?

1537
01:11:31,149 --> 01:11:31,949
Please come

1538
01:11:32,021 --> 01:11:32,861
Sister-in-law?

1539
01:11:33,621 --> 01:11:35,621
- Did Bhuvana come here?
- No, she didn't

1540
01:11:35,661 --> 01:11:37,341
She has been here
since this morning

1541
01:11:37,421 --> 01:11:38,341
Please come in

1542
01:11:38,701 --> 01:11:39,701
Bhuvana

1543
01:11:41,661 --> 01:11:43,821
Why did you come here
without telling any of us?

1544
01:11:43,861 --> 01:11:45,541
Tell me if that blockhead
has left, I'll come

1545
01:11:45,621 --> 01:11:48,461
- What, Bhuvana?
- Her Uncle is here

1546
01:11:48,501 --> 01:11:52,261
I told him she has got a job in
Hyderabad and is joining next week

1547
01:11:52,301 --> 01:11:55,941
He was against her working
and said he'll find her a groom

1548
01:11:55,981 --> 01:11:57,461
Why is he behaving
like a marriage broker?

1549
01:11:57,501 --> 01:11:58,501
Come soon

1550
01:11:58,541 --> 01:12:01,421
I'll see you later
My son is asleep and alone

1551
01:12:02,221 --> 01:12:04,461
Selvi, deliver this basket
in your uncle's house

1552
01:12:04,501 --> 01:12:05,341
Okay

1553
01:12:06,901 --> 01:12:08,181
Bhuvana akka

1554
01:12:08,261 --> 01:12:12,021
- When are you joining work?
- Leaving tomorrow night

1555
01:12:12,061 --> 01:12:14,581
If you have any doubts,
get it cleared right now

1556
01:12:14,621 --> 01:12:17,821
After I leave, don't feel bad
you didn't ask me

1557
01:12:18,249 --> 01:12:20,141
How silly of me to say
all this to you

1558
01:12:20,541 --> 01:12:22,301
You need a special brand of guts

1559
01:12:24,301 --> 01:12:25,701
Hey, wait

1560
01:12:31,301 --> 01:12:32,981
Called me a coward?

1561
01:12:34,101 --> 01:12:36,101
What are you doing?

1562
01:12:36,981 --> 01:12:38,101
No...?

1563
01:12:40,461 --> 01:12:41,981
Akka, why did you push me?

1564
01:12:42,021 --> 01:12:43,701
What kind of
new game is this?

1565
01:12:49,821 --> 01:12:51,981
Forever listening
to MGR songs

1566
01:12:52,021 --> 01:12:54,101
Listen to 'king of love'
Gemini Ganesan's songs too!

1567
01:12:58,261 --> 01:13:00,421
I believe the opening scene
in the movie is awesome

1568
01:13:00,461 --> 01:13:02,101
- Shall we leave?
- Where to?

1569
01:13:02,141 --> 01:13:03,381
To the theater of course

1570
01:13:03,421 --> 01:13:05,301
Should be half way through by now

1571
01:13:05,673 --> 01:13:06,873
Oh! I see

1572
01:13:06,898 --> 01:13:08,818
Okay, forget it
We'll go for night show

1573
01:13:08,981 --> 01:13:12,021
I believe this Bhuvana is
going to Hyderabad tomorrow

1574
01:13:12,061 --> 01:13:13,141
Why are you feeling sad?

1575
01:13:13,181 --> 01:13:16,239
- Don't you know she likes me?
- Did she say so?

1576
01:13:16,264 --> 01:13:17,704
- No
- Then?

1577
01:13:17,735 --> 01:13:18,815
That's my question too

1578
01:13:18,839 --> 01:13:20,679
She's confessing it
to everyone in town

1579
01:13:20,821 --> 01:13:22,901
Why can't she tell me
face to face that she likes me?

1580
01:13:22,926 --> 01:13:23,833
This is too much

1581
01:13:23,858 --> 01:13:25,578
You're behaving like Prabhu
in the film 'Chinna Thambi'

1582
01:13:25,603 --> 01:13:26,963
- You think this is possible?
- Why not?

1583
01:13:26,988 --> 01:13:28,068
Listen to my voice of experience

1584
01:13:28,185 --> 01:13:30,265
No girl will profess her love
of her own accord

1585
01:13:30,461 --> 01:13:32,581
- 'Why' is my question?
- They just won't

1586
01:13:32,621 --> 01:13:34,460
Suppose after marriage
she doesn't get along...?

1587
01:13:34,485 --> 01:13:38,205
Then she needs an excuse to say
she never fell for you but you did

1588
01:13:38,421 --> 01:13:40,261
Dude, congratulations!

1589
01:13:40,437 --> 01:13:42,917
For all the times that girls have
trampled over you, I swear...

1590
01:13:42,942 --> 01:13:44,141
...1st time you're talking sense!

1591
01:13:44,181 --> 01:13:45,341
I knew it was a royal dig!

1592
01:13:45,381 --> 01:13:46,661
Pugazh, look there

1593
01:13:47,741 --> 01:13:49,581
- This is the right time
- For what?

1594
01:13:49,621 --> 01:13:52,381
- Express your love
- So I should be the 1st to tell her?

1595
01:13:52,461 --> 01:13:53,581
Don't waste time, go

1596
01:13:53,621 --> 01:13:54,501
Kidding?

1597
01:13:54,541 --> 01:13:56,021
You need guts to do so!

1598
01:13:56,061 --> 01:13:57,181
Want to see my guts?

1599
01:13:57,221 --> 01:13:58,101
Watch me now

1600
01:13:58,581 --> 01:13:59,381
Sit down

1601
01:13:59,421 --> 01:14:00,621
Let's see
his next move

1602
01:14:06,581 --> 01:14:07,341
I lo-

1603
01:14:07,381 --> 01:14:08,221
What?

1604
01:14:08,581 --> 01:14:10,941
Your 'dupatta' might
get caught in the wheel

1605
01:14:12,901 --> 01:14:14,821
'She isn't even wearing
a salwar and kameez'

1606
01:14:14,861 --> 01:14:16,701
You usually wear a 'dupatta', right?

1607
01:14:16,741 --> 01:14:19,461
That's why I thought
I should caution yo-

1608
01:14:19,912 --> 01:14:21,192
Thanks
For what?

1609
01:14:21,381 --> 01:14:23,741
You are drooling all over
Kindly wipe yourself!

1610
01:14:36,101 --> 01:14:37,301
What happened?

1611
01:14:37,701 --> 01:14:39,181
Did you tell her?

1612
01:14:39,236 --> 01:14:41,916
No, she's shy
to talk in public

1613
01:14:41,941 --> 01:14:44,021
She is shy?

1614
01:14:44,061 --> 01:14:45,981
What did she give you?

1615
01:14:47,421 --> 01:14:49,221
I have many kerchiefs like this

1616
01:14:49,261 --> 01:14:50,781
- Did you tell her or not?
- How could I?

1617
01:14:50,806 --> 01:14:53,046
When I see her,
I get tongue-tied

1618
01:14:53,101 --> 01:14:55,101
Is this kerchief your way
of showing your guts?

1619
01:14:55,141 --> 01:14:56,661
Heights of love, huh?

1620
01:15:03,501 --> 01:15:05,781
- What, Pugazh?
- Tell me, Mudaliar

1621
01:15:06,438 --> 01:15:09,716
Where's your councilor friend?
Missing for the past 10 days

1622
01:15:09,741 --> 01:15:10,861
Tell me what you want

1623
01:15:10,901 --> 01:15:13,021
No street lights
for the past 1 week

1624
01:15:13,061 --> 01:15:15,581
I want to inform him
but he's nowhere to be seen

1625
01:15:15,661 --> 01:15:17,981
If you call the Electricity board
they will send one of their men

1626
01:15:18,021 --> 01:15:19,381
Why do you need
the councilor?

1627
01:15:19,406 --> 01:15:20,861
Of course I called them

1628
01:15:20,901 --> 01:15:23,861
And I also went in person
They are least bit bothered

1629
01:15:24,119 --> 01:15:25,021
I'll check and get back

1630
01:15:25,201 --> 01:15:27,241
Yesterday some of our girls
came to the temple

1631
01:15:27,266 --> 01:15:30,746
Some son of a gun
made a pass at them

1632
01:15:32,196 --> 01:15:33,996
Why are you looking
at me like that?

1633
01:15:34,021 --> 01:15:35,781
I was with you in the shop
whole of yesterday

1634
01:15:36,755 --> 01:15:39,275
Okay, Mudaliar
I'll ask Venkat to meet you

1635
01:15:40,141 --> 01:15:42,221
Pugazh, come here

1636
01:15:45,282 --> 01:15:45,901
What, bro?

1637
01:15:45,941 --> 01:15:47,501
They dug the sewage
and left it open

1638
01:15:47,541 --> 01:15:49,581
If I complain they give
some lame excuses

1639
01:15:49,621 --> 01:15:51,181
Water is stagnant here
for the past 1 week

1640
01:15:51,261 --> 01:15:52,981
Ask Venkat to check this out

1641
01:15:53,596 --> 01:15:54,781
Okay, I'll let him know

1642
01:15:54,821 --> 01:15:56,701
We all voted for him
because you vouched for him

1643
01:15:56,835 --> 01:15:58,955
How can he be
so irresponsible now?

1644
01:15:59,777 --> 01:16:02,737
We believed you and Pugazh
and voted for Venkat

1645
01:16:02,835 --> 01:16:04,821
- You took money and voted
- Where do we find him?

1646
01:16:04,846 --> 01:16:07,126
If you hadn't taken their bribe
anybody can go ask him

1647
01:16:07,221 --> 01:16:08,341
What happened, akka?

1648
01:16:08,396 --> 01:16:10,676
They are lining up to get
their daughters married to you!

1649
01:16:10,904 --> 01:16:12,184
Where the hell is that Venkat?

1650
01:16:12,261 --> 01:16:13,906
Where did he disappear
without even doing this?

1651
01:16:13,931 --> 01:16:15,371
Tell him directly

1652
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:16,701
What's the problem?

1653
01:16:16,741 --> 01:16:19,141
All the wards in the municipality
are giving free blender and grinder

1654
01:16:19,181 --> 01:16:21,344
When we went and asked
they want us to bring the councilor

1655
01:16:21,369 --> 01:16:24,049
All other councilors are
collecting the stuff responsibly

1656
01:16:24,276 --> 01:16:25,156
Where is Venkat?

1657
01:16:25,181 --> 01:16:26,621
We trusted you and voted for him

1658
01:16:26,661 --> 01:16:28,141
Where do we go
looking for him?

1659
01:16:28,221 --> 01:16:30,381
I'll find him and bring him

1660
01:16:30,461 --> 01:16:35,501
If he doesn't show up by tomorrow,
you'll see our other side!

1661
01:16:37,341 --> 01:16:38,661
'Pugazh, this is Muthu here'

1662
01:16:38,701 --> 01:16:39,390
Tell me, Muthu

1663
01:16:39,415 --> 01:16:41,055
'Where's Venkat?
His phone is switched off'

1664
01:16:41,301 --> 01:16:43,381
'We haven't had water supply
for the past 4 days'

1665
01:16:43,421 --> 01:16:44,461
'This isn't good, Pugazh'

1666
01:16:44,501 --> 01:16:45,941
I'll find out and get back

1667
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:48,181
Where did he go?

1668
01:16:48,221 --> 01:16:49,981
- Who?
- Venkat

1669
01:16:50,021 --> 01:16:51,341
Irresponsible!

1670
01:16:51,381 --> 01:16:52,860
Besides pestering me on the road...

1671
01:16:52,885 --> 01:16:54,165
...now they've started calling me too

1672
01:16:54,190 --> 01:16:56,870
Naturally they'll ask you
You made him win

1673
01:16:57,101 --> 01:16:58,237
He's busy with a zillion jobs

1674
01:16:58,262 --> 01:17:00,142
He has to collect bribes
from the shops

1675
01:17:00,341 --> 01:17:03,141
Collect fees from the cycle stand
and toilets in the bus stand

1676
01:17:03,581 --> 01:17:05,021
Das is a bad influence on him

1677
01:17:05,156 --> 01:17:07,356
Even if Das uses the restroom,
he takes Venkat along!

1678
01:17:07,381 --> 01:17:10,381
- What are you doing here?
- We are just chatting

1679
01:17:10,436 --> 01:17:12,716
Do you make fun of
the girls who pass by?

1680
01:17:12,741 --> 01:17:14,421
No, sir, we came by to drink tea

1681
01:17:14,461 --> 01:17:16,261
Leave now, you can't
hang around here

1682
01:17:16,661 --> 01:17:17,981
He's jobless

1683
01:17:18,021 --> 01:17:19,261
He'll show off only to us!

1684
01:17:19,541 --> 01:17:21,661
- Why are you off-mood?
- Nothing of that sort

1685
01:17:21,701 --> 01:17:22,981
One look and its obvious

1686
01:17:23,021 --> 01:17:24,221
What happened?

1687
01:17:24,461 --> 01:17:25,991
No water in our area
for the past 2 days

1688
01:17:26,016 --> 01:17:28,696
Went to the municipality to inquire
But no one responded properly

1689
01:17:28,861 --> 01:17:30,181
They told me to go
ask my councilor

1690
01:17:30,221 --> 01:17:31,821
So I went to see Venkat

1691
01:17:33,015 --> 01:17:34,975
We were just talking
and he suddenly hit me

1692
01:17:35,101 --> 01:17:35,981
Where is he now?

1693
01:17:36,021 --> 01:17:39,061
To lay proper roads
Rs 80 lakhs has been sanction-

1694
01:17:39,101 --> 01:17:40,621
Venkat, come out

1695
01:17:40,902 --> 01:17:42,941
How dare you barge in here!

1696
01:17:42,981 --> 01:17:44,421
- Come out, I say
- Wait, da

1697
01:17:44,461 --> 01:17:45,675
We are discussing
something important

1698
01:17:45,700 --> 01:17:46,420
I'll join you soon

1699
01:17:46,445 --> 01:17:48,925
You'll discuss whose
pockets get lined to what %

1700
01:17:49,181 --> 01:17:50,381
Come out right now

1701
01:17:50,421 --> 01:17:51,861
How dare you insult us!

1702
01:17:52,781 --> 01:17:56,661
(overlap of angry voices)

1703
01:17:56,861 --> 01:17:59,901
Venkat, better step out

1704
01:18:01,293 --> 01:18:03,573
Such a big shot
he won't come, huh?

1705
01:18:04,661 --> 01:18:06,552
Why are you coming out now?
Go and butter him up

1706
01:18:06,632 --> 01:18:07,392
Wait

1707
01:18:07,510 --> 01:18:09,710
Making a scene as if
he's in the parliament

1708
01:18:11,999 --> 01:18:14,599
I told you I was coming
And you started yelling

1709
01:18:14,701 --> 01:18:16,461
I'll come over to your place
and talk to you later

1710
01:18:16,486 --> 01:18:17,766
Problem is you aren't showing up

1711
01:18:17,876 --> 01:18:19,196
Everybody is hounding me...

1712
01:18:19,221 --> 01:18:21,461
...about how you're not doing
your councilor's job properly

1713
01:18:21,501 --> 01:18:23,472
He told you about
the water problem and you hit him

1714
01:18:23,497 --> 01:18:24,857
Don't judge me
without hearing me out

1715
01:18:24,937 --> 01:18:27,897
I was talking to the Commissioner
And he barged in and yelled

1716
01:18:28,092 --> 01:18:29,532
So you'll hit him, huh?

1717
01:18:29,621 --> 01:18:31,853
If not for them, will you be
talking to the any of these VIPs?

1718
01:18:31,878 --> 01:18:33,238
I can't be defending you to everyone

1719
01:18:33,263 --> 01:18:34,743
Come there and
speak for yourself

1720
01:18:34,918 --> 01:18:36,478
Keep your answers ready
and come there

1721
01:18:36,581 --> 01:18:39,701
(angry voices)

1722
01:18:56,381 --> 01:18:58,621
We'll elect someone
from our own ward

1723
01:18:58,661 --> 01:18:59,741
You carry on

1724
01:19:04,467 --> 01:19:07,301
They are angry with Das
And showing it on me

1725
01:19:10,821 --> 01:19:12,181
Resign from this post

1726
01:19:12,301 --> 01:19:13,701
How can you say that?

1727
01:19:14,501 --> 01:19:15,621
Do it

1728
01:19:16,389 --> 01:19:19,229
You made me stand and win
Now you want me to resign

1729
01:19:19,341 --> 01:19:20,581
That's the main issue

1730
01:19:20,730 --> 01:19:22,559
If you had won on your own,
why would I ask?

1731
01:19:22,621 --> 01:19:24,581
Now everyone is
landing up at my doorstep

1732
01:19:24,621 --> 01:19:26,301
My brother is also
getting stressed out

1733
01:19:26,341 --> 01:19:28,061
I'm unable to
address their issues

1734
01:19:28,141 --> 01:19:30,621
Listen, politics isn't for us

1735
01:19:30,661 --> 01:19:31,901
Just resign

1736
01:19:32,701 --> 01:19:34,381
What do I tell Das?

1737
01:19:34,421 --> 01:19:35,781
Tell him what really happened

1738
01:19:39,501 --> 01:19:40,541
Venkat is here

1739
01:19:43,181 --> 01:19:45,341
I heard you want to resign?

1740
01:19:46,611 --> 01:19:48,331
You think you can
change your mind...

1741
01:19:48,356 --> 01:19:50,196
...like the games
you play in the ground?

1742
01:19:50,221 --> 01:19:52,701
Random strangers are questioning me
I'm unable to answer them

1743
01:19:52,741 --> 01:19:54,605
Pugazh also is asking me to resign

1744
01:19:54,661 --> 01:19:56,101
The people are mad at me

1745
01:19:56,141 --> 01:19:58,301
Not knowing how to react,
I also accepted to resign

1746
01:19:58,341 --> 01:19:59,741
People will naturally pester you

1747
01:19:59,781 --> 01:20:01,003
But you should somehow manage

1748
01:20:01,149 --> 01:20:03,565
You said the opposition was
ready to grease your palm

1749
01:20:03,648 --> 01:20:06,048
I gave you 2 lakhs
You should've resigned then

1750
01:20:06,781 --> 01:20:09,141
You were worried you'll lose
your house thanks to your loans

1751
01:20:09,181 --> 01:20:10,590
I paid to retrieve
your house documents

1752
01:20:10,615 --> 01:20:12,575
If you had resigned then,
that's fair play

1753
01:20:12,741 --> 01:20:15,101
If you aren't the councilor,
I'm not the chairman either

1754
01:20:15,141 --> 01:20:17,861
Do you know I've waited
for 3 elections for this 1 vote?

1755
01:20:17,901 --> 01:20:19,725
To become the chairman
I sold all my property

1756
01:20:19,871 --> 01:20:22,551
Including my wife's wedding chain
and spent 6 million totally

1757
01:20:22,637 --> 01:20:25,317
You promised the minister you'll finish
the ground deal and you took money

1758
01:20:25,342 --> 01:20:27,502
Now if you resign the post
who will face his wrath?

1759
01:20:27,543 --> 01:20:29,543
What do you want me to do?

1760
01:20:29,661 --> 01:20:31,701
'I can't do anything
without Pugazh's consent'

1761
01:20:35,901 --> 01:20:40,981
You come running to me
when a twerp wants to resign!

1762
01:20:41,141 --> 01:20:44,581
It's my mistake for giving you
a job beyond your capabilities

1763
01:20:45,089 --> 01:20:46,289
It isn't what you think, bro

1764
01:20:46,314 --> 01:20:47,954
Pugazh is the main reason

1765
01:20:48,261 --> 01:20:50,300
Venkat isn't willing
to oppose Pugazh

1766
01:20:50,381 --> 01:20:53,908
Already Pugazh is unwilling to let go
of the ground and has garnered support

1767
01:20:54,025 --> 01:20:55,981
That old man is hell bent
on a court case

1768
01:20:56,021 --> 01:20:59,101
If he resigns his job at this time,
I'll lose my chairman post

1769
01:20:59,413 --> 01:21:02,453
It's very confusing
Don't know what to do

1770
01:21:03,061 --> 01:21:04,821
That's why I came to see you

1771
01:21:05,261 --> 01:21:08,461
- Where is Venkat?
- He's in the car

1772
01:21:10,221 --> 01:21:14,581
If Pugazh is responsible for all this,
you decide what to do with him

1773
01:21:14,964 --> 01:21:17,821
Next month when I come
to Wallajah for the meeting...

1774
01:21:17,861 --> 01:21:19,871
...the building should be
finished by then

1775
01:21:19,941 --> 01:21:21,381
Do you get it?

1776
01:21:21,541 --> 01:21:23,501
I'll give you time
until tomorrow

1777
01:21:23,581 --> 01:21:26,141
Tell me either 'yes' or 'no'

1778
01:21:26,173 --> 01:21:29,853
Because Ranipet Shekhar has been
asking me for a long time

1779
01:21:29,901 --> 01:21:33,021
Only drawback, the kickback
of 20 million will go to him

1780
01:21:33,061 --> 01:21:33,773
That's all

1781
01:21:33,816 --> 01:21:36,016
Bro, please don't make
such a drastic move

1782
01:21:36,221 --> 01:21:37,621
I'll clinch the deal for you

1783
01:21:42,781 --> 01:21:44,941
'TODAY'

1784
01:21:46,461 --> 01:21:48,181
Mother, shut the gate

1785
01:21:54,621 --> 01:21:55,901
Maaaa?

1786
01:21:58,421 --> 01:21:59,301
Pugazh...?

1787
01:21:59,381 --> 01:22:00,581
- Arasu
- What, ma?

1788
01:22:00,661 --> 01:22:02,621
- Come fast
- Why are you yelling now?

1789
01:22:02,981 --> 01:22:04,861
Pugazh, what happened to you?

1790
01:22:04,941 --> 01:22:06,901
Someone hit him and ran away

1791
01:22:06,941 --> 01:22:08,941
Who hit him?

1792
01:22:09,341 --> 01:22:11,061
Balaji, let's take him to a hospital

1793
01:22:11,101 --> 01:22:12,221
Balaji, start the vehicle

1794
01:22:12,301 --> 01:22:15,181
Did you listen to me when
I told you not to get into this?

1795
01:22:18,621 --> 01:22:21,501
Do you know who hit you?

1796
01:22:21,541 --> 01:22:22,301
Why?

1797
01:22:22,341 --> 01:22:23,821
If you tell us
we can take action

1798
01:22:24,341 --> 01:22:26,221
No, sir
I slipped and fell

1799
01:22:26,261 --> 01:22:27,461
So no one slashed you?

1800
01:22:27,486 --> 01:22:29,686
Honestly when I came out of
the house, I just slipped and fell

1801
01:22:29,781 --> 01:22:31,061
You don't intend telling us

1802
01:22:31,101 --> 01:22:32,221
I'll pay that money-

1803
01:22:32,261 --> 01:22:33,101
Doctor, just a minute

1804
01:22:33,141 --> 01:22:34,981
- Uncle
- What?

1805
01:22:36,381 --> 01:22:38,101
- No need, Uncle
- I'll just see him once

1806
01:22:38,141 --> 01:22:39,061
Please don't

1807
01:22:39,101 --> 01:22:40,981
If you want to do
something good for him...

1808
01:22:41,021 --> 01:22:42,421
...stop seeing him

1809
01:22:42,457 --> 01:22:46,381
All his classmates are working,
happily settled with their families

1810
01:22:46,461 --> 01:22:49,461
He joined you and is forever
thinking about others' problems

1811
01:22:49,501 --> 01:22:52,141
And my head is swimming
with problems

1812
01:22:52,381 --> 01:22:55,098
Please don't mistake me
for saying this to you

1813
01:22:55,381 --> 01:22:59,461
Practice of protesting for a public cause
by collecting funds is long gone

1814
01:22:59,501 --> 01:23:02,581
Today even an ordinary
ward councilor comes in a fancy car

1815
01:23:02,621 --> 01:23:05,381
You ride the same rusty cycle
for the past 45 years

1816
01:23:05,421 --> 01:23:08,381
And you owe money to
the chap who pumps air into it

1817
01:23:09,461 --> 01:23:10,821
Please leave us alone

1818
01:23:18,381 --> 01:23:21,381
People are wondering
if Venkat did this to you

1819
01:23:21,421 --> 01:23:22,981
I think they maybe right

1820
01:23:23,981 --> 01:23:25,581
He wouldn't have done that

1821
01:23:25,621 --> 01:23:26,541
I know him very well

1822
01:23:26,621 --> 01:23:28,301
Then he should have
come to see you, right?

1823
01:23:28,341 --> 01:23:29,541
Why hide?

1824
01:23:36,261 --> 01:23:38,861
- Which ward is he in?
- 1st floor, special ward

1825
01:23:38,901 --> 01:23:40,741
I'll leave as soon
as mother comes

1826
01:23:41,501 --> 01:23:42,381
Where's Pugazh?

1827
01:23:42,421 --> 01:23:43,581
3rd room

1828
01:23:44,821 --> 01:23:46,901
The nurse is changing his dressing

1829
01:23:54,821 --> 01:23:55,901
Hello, Bhuvana

1830
01:23:56,821 --> 01:23:58,061
Hey! Come on

1831
01:23:58,101 --> 01:23:59,701
- How did this happen?
- Nothing serious

1832
01:23:59,741 --> 01:24:00,781
Just a gash

1833
01:24:07,341 --> 01:24:08,501
Bro, this is-

1834
01:24:11,421 --> 01:24:12,381
Come, bro

1835
01:24:12,741 --> 01:24:15,181
- He wanted to see you
- Please come

1836
01:24:15,221 --> 01:24:17,901
- How are you doing?
- I'm good

1837
01:24:17,941 --> 01:24:20,421
I warned you about politics
but you didn't heed my words

1838
01:24:20,461 --> 01:24:21,461
See what happened

1839
01:24:21,501 --> 01:24:23,341
At least from now on
be on your guard

1840
01:24:23,981 --> 01:24:27,501
I fell in love with you
on first sight

1841
01:24:27,661 --> 01:24:29,781
After that I felt
like seeing you 24x7

1842
01:24:29,821 --> 01:24:31,781
Had I been in town that day...

1843
01:24:31,821 --> 01:24:33,283
...I wouldn't have
let them thrash you

1844
01:24:33,403 --> 01:24:34,363
What are you saying?

1845
01:24:34,388 --> 01:24:37,628
You'll go daily at 4:00 a.m
to your shop, right?

1846
01:24:37,808 --> 01:24:38,808
Yes

1847
01:24:39,021 --> 01:24:41,701
I'll set my alarm at 4:00
to come out to see you

1848
01:24:47,541 --> 01:24:49,701
But you won't know
I'm watching you

1849
01:24:50,501 --> 01:24:53,261
You'll look at my house
before you leave too

1850
01:24:53,421 --> 01:24:55,421
I knew right then

1851
01:24:58,981 --> 01:25:01,261
Some days you won't
look at my house

1852
01:25:01,301 --> 01:25:03,781
I'd really feel
as if I missed something

1853
01:25:04,535 --> 01:25:08,227
So I'll come over to your place
with some silly excuse

1854
01:25:11,581 --> 01:25:13,221
Where is Venkat?

1855
01:25:14,767 --> 01:25:15,767
Where is he?

1856
01:25:15,792 --> 01:25:16,872
Why ask us?

1857
01:25:17,061 --> 01:25:18,268
He's missing from the day
you were attacked

1858
01:25:18,501 --> 01:25:20,621
Most people suspect
he had a hand in this

1859
01:25:20,646 --> 01:25:22,126
Don't talk rubbish

1860
01:25:22,362 --> 01:25:23,482
Did you see him?

1861
01:25:23,585 --> 01:25:26,185
The night you got hurt, we saw him
with 'Canopy' Palani

1862
01:25:26,210 --> 01:25:28,050
After that he just
vanished into thin air

1863
01:25:33,303 --> 01:25:34,103
Okay, sir

1864
01:25:34,128 --> 01:25:36,208
You can take him home today

1865
01:25:36,343 --> 01:25:37,983
- Bring an auto
- Okay, bro

1866
01:25:38,008 --> 01:25:38,848
Take that bag with you

1867
01:25:39,021 --> 01:25:39,901
Okay, sure

1868
01:25:41,830 --> 01:25:43,190
- Come fast
- Sure

1869
01:25:46,248 --> 01:25:48,848
Why get your hands dirty
in all this politics?

1870
01:25:48,873 --> 01:25:50,650
You've graduated
in some subject, right?

1871
01:25:50,675 --> 01:25:53,235
Either get yourself a job
or take care of the shop

1872
01:25:53,260 --> 01:25:55,500
Stop poking your nose
into others' business

1873
01:25:55,964 --> 01:25:58,284
Wrap up all this social service

1874
01:26:04,421 --> 01:26:05,461
Palani, stop

1875
01:26:05,501 --> 01:26:06,621
Pugazh

1876
01:26:07,381 --> 01:26:08,621
Wait

1877
01:26:08,821 --> 01:26:09,861
How will he stop?

1878
01:26:10,101 --> 01:26:11,421
He loves chasing trouble!

1879
01:26:11,461 --> 01:26:12,821
Go fast

1880
01:26:12,861 --> 01:26:14,461
He's turning a deaf ear

1881
01:26:22,221 --> 01:26:23,181
I know nothing

1882
01:26:23,301 --> 01:26:24,741
Bro asked me to bring him home

1883
01:26:24,781 --> 01:26:25,781
And I did

1884
01:26:25,821 --> 01:26:27,421
That's all I know, Pugazh

1885
01:26:27,661 --> 01:26:29,541
Where is Venkat?
Tell me

1886
01:26:29,621 --> 01:26:30,781
Where is he?

1887
01:26:30,821 --> 01:26:32,661
Why are you creating
a ruckus here?

1888
01:26:32,701 --> 01:26:36,141
Wondering why I'm not lying lifeless
in a graveyard and standing here?

1889
01:26:36,181 --> 01:26:39,701
Next time you send your man
make sure he does a clean job!

1890
01:26:39,741 --> 01:26:41,252
Are you such a big shot
for me to kill you?

1891
01:26:41,277 --> 01:26:42,357
You are a trouble maker

1892
01:26:42,394 --> 01:26:43,394
Wonder who attacked you!

1893
01:26:43,419 --> 01:26:44,539
You wait

1894
01:26:44,758 --> 01:26:46,758
You told your friend to resign
from his councilor's post

1895
01:26:46,783 --> 01:26:48,223
Maybe he got mad
and tried to kill you

1896
01:26:48,381 --> 01:26:50,061
- Go and ask him
- You didn't instigate this?

1897
01:26:50,101 --> 01:26:51,621
Don't play this
political drama with me

1898
01:26:51,661 --> 01:26:53,021
You think I don't know anything?

1899
01:26:53,061 --> 01:26:54,981
Venkat has to come here
by this evening, got it?

1900
01:26:55,006 --> 01:26:57,326
Arasu, I won't be
even tempered always

1901
01:26:57,581 --> 01:26:58,941
Then it will be
too late to regret

1902
01:26:58,966 --> 01:26:59,806
Advise him

1903
01:26:59,831 --> 01:27:00,671
Don't make it worse

1904
01:27:01,067 --> 01:27:01,861
What the hell will you do?

1905
01:27:01,901 --> 01:27:02,661
Hey! Get lost

1906
01:27:02,701 --> 01:27:04,615
I have seen many 'wannabes' like you

1907
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:06,680
Stop this ruckus
and go home

1908
01:27:06,901 --> 01:27:09,101
Go

1909
01:27:12,981 --> 01:27:14,701
Get down and go inside

1910
01:27:16,897 --> 01:27:17,817
Pay the auto

1911
01:27:18,061 --> 01:27:18,941
How much?

1912
01:27:18,981 --> 01:27:19,981
Pugazh

1913
01:27:20,021 --> 01:27:20,941
Come in

1914
01:27:20,981 --> 01:27:22,198
Why are you dragging him like this?

1915
01:27:22,223 --> 01:27:24,423
You pampered him so much
and see the mess we are in!

1916
01:27:24,490 --> 01:27:25,370
Attend to your work

1917
01:27:25,511 --> 01:27:26,911
Okay, let go of him

1918
01:27:26,936 --> 01:27:27,816
Let go

1919
01:27:27,926 --> 01:27:29,326
Don't walk away like that

1920
01:27:29,431 --> 01:27:31,831
Your husband used to rush
to help people in need, no?

1921
01:27:31,856 --> 01:27:33,816
Your son will also be
in that same mess!

1922
01:27:33,970 --> 01:27:34,970
Let go of my hand

1923
01:27:35,142 --> 01:27:37,102
What did I do for you to be
so upset with me?

1924
01:27:37,142 --> 01:27:38,542
What more should you do?

1925
01:27:38,567 --> 01:27:40,087
What other plans
are you hatching?

1926
01:27:40,134 --> 01:27:41,734
This mess is bad enough!

1927
01:27:41,799 --> 01:27:42,799
Go inside

1928
01:27:42,941 --> 01:27:44,073
Why are you pushing him inside?

1929
01:27:44,098 --> 01:27:44,858
What happened?

1930
01:27:44,977 --> 01:27:46,057
'Open the door, anna'

1931
01:27:46,082 --> 01:27:48,722
His wound isn't healed as yet
He's picking another fight already!

1932
01:27:48,747 --> 01:27:49,747
Ma, please open the door

1933
01:27:49,772 --> 01:27:51,292
If you leave it like this,
it won't work out

1934
01:27:51,354 --> 01:27:53,634
- Where's Pugazh?
- He's in his room

1935
01:27:54,184 --> 01:27:56,224
My brother has locked him up

1936
01:27:56,872 --> 01:27:58,872
Please wait, I'll go get
the key from my mother

1937
01:27:59,061 --> 01:28:00,421
No need, it's okay

1938
01:28:02,541 --> 01:28:03,901
I'll come later

1939
01:28:05,172 --> 01:28:07,572
I like your brother's courage
and anger very much

1940
01:28:07,621 --> 01:28:09,855
But I'm not bold enough
to get my sister married to him

1941
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:12,560
No sir, you have
misunderstood my brother

1942
01:28:12,742 --> 01:28:15,062
I'm saying this only because
I've understood your brother well

1943
01:28:15,181 --> 01:28:17,661
Once he gets married
he'll be fine

1944
01:28:17,905 --> 01:28:19,341
You're saying this
with blind faith in him

1945
01:28:19,381 --> 01:28:21,781
But he's blind enough
not to know his opponent

1946
01:28:21,861 --> 01:28:23,101
Please don't get me wrong

1947
01:28:23,141 --> 01:28:24,861
He was in hospital now

1948
01:28:24,901 --> 01:28:26,412
If something drastic happens
he will face the consequences

1949
01:28:26,437 --> 01:28:28,397
But if my sister gets married
and he gets attacked...

1950
01:28:28,422 --> 01:28:30,302
...won't her life be affected?

1951
01:28:33,577 --> 01:28:35,697
I see your point of view

1952
01:28:35,914 --> 01:28:38,674
But they are both
interested in each other

1953
01:28:38,862 --> 01:28:40,462
Attend to the baby

1954
01:28:40,487 --> 01:28:41,847
If he gets married...

1955
01:28:42,061 --> 01:28:43,560
...we thought my brother
will settle down in his life

1956
01:28:43,850 --> 01:28:45,170
That's why we broached this subject

1957
01:28:45,735 --> 01:28:49,135
If his fate is to resort to blows
and bruises throughout his life...

1958
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:50,920
...what can we do?

1959
01:28:51,042 --> 01:28:52,402
Okay, sir
Let's go

1960
01:28:52,453 --> 01:28:54,413
Anna, 1 minute
Please sit

1961
01:28:56,061 --> 01:28:57,741
Anna, will you come upstairs?

1962
01:28:59,127 --> 01:29:00,567
You are scared
for no reason

1963
01:29:00,592 --> 01:29:02,632
So knowingly you want
to dig your own grave?

1964
01:29:02,876 --> 01:29:06,116
Girls generally will want
to marry a courageous man

1965
01:29:06,141 --> 01:29:07,141
Don't be in a rush

1966
01:29:07,181 --> 01:29:07,720
This is your life

1967
01:29:07,745 --> 01:29:09,105
We must think a 100 times
before we decide

1968
01:29:09,188 --> 01:29:10,668
There's nothing to think

1969
01:29:11,070 --> 01:29:12,470
This is my decision

1970
01:29:16,261 --> 01:29:17,821
Are you happy?

1971
01:29:21,992 --> 01:29:23,992
Ma, none of my friends
drop by nowadays?

1972
01:29:24,181 --> 01:29:25,381
No, they don't

1973
01:29:30,968 --> 01:29:32,928
Call Balaji

1974
01:29:33,101 --> 01:29:34,341
Okay, uncle

1975
01:29:38,741 --> 01:29:41,341
Pugazh

1976
01:29:41,781 --> 01:29:43,381
I'm coming, wait

1977
01:29:43,421 --> 01:29:44,821
Where are you going?

1978
01:29:45,432 --> 01:29:46,872
Why did you ask me to come?

1979
01:29:46,897 --> 01:29:48,377
Ma, you lock me in
and take away my phone

1980
01:29:48,402 --> 01:29:49,682
Get the gate keys

1981
01:29:51,168 --> 01:29:52,779
My brother and mother
are driving me up the wall

1982
01:29:52,804 --> 01:29:55,204
Don't go out, no calls,
don't take the bike out

1983
01:29:55,643 --> 01:29:58,163
If your brother knows
you went out, he'll yell at me

1984
01:29:58,461 --> 01:29:59,661
Ma, don't be silly

1985
01:29:59,741 --> 01:30:00,639
Don't I know to
jump over our gate?

1986
01:30:00,696 --> 01:30:01,856
Open the door, ma

1987
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:04,640
What should I tell him if he asks?

1988
01:30:04,665 --> 01:30:05,545
Tell him I called him out

1989
01:30:05,570 --> 01:30:06,410
He won't mind

1990
01:30:06,435 --> 01:30:07,635
That's the last straw!

1991
01:30:08,111 --> 01:30:09,551
Pugazh, your brother might see you

1992
01:30:09,576 --> 01:30:10,656
Come back soon

1993
01:30:10,681 --> 01:30:11,761
Where did you go?

1994
01:30:11,969 --> 01:30:13,289
Dude, let's go to the ground

1995
01:30:13,368 --> 01:30:14,688
Uncle lifted me up

1996
01:30:16,295 --> 01:30:17,528
Friends are all in the tea shop

1997
01:30:17,553 --> 01:30:19,633
It has been really a long time
since I went to the ground

1998
01:30:20,021 --> 01:30:21,101
Just go

1999
01:30:21,807 --> 01:30:23,767
- Listen to me
- Give me your phone

2000
01:30:26,013 --> 01:30:28,613
I've messaged
all our friends to come here

2001
01:30:28,663 --> 01:30:29,823
They will come now

2002
01:30:29,981 --> 01:30:31,381
Fat hopes!

2003
01:30:34,581 --> 01:30:36,541
Hey! What is this?

2004
01:30:36,581 --> 01:30:38,221
Anna asked me not to tell you

2005
01:30:38,316 --> 01:30:39,836
Were you twiddling your thumbs?!

2006
01:30:39,861 --> 01:30:41,941
Vishnu and Das
didn't spare anyone

2007
01:30:41,981 --> 01:30:43,341
They threatened everyone

2008
01:30:43,528 --> 01:30:46,648
Devaraj, ask your son to stop
befriending him and making trouble

2009
01:30:46,734 --> 01:30:47,934
You know what I mean!

2010
01:30:48,030 --> 01:30:49,510
Then don't come crying to me

2011
01:30:49,581 --> 01:30:51,501
I'm warning you
because I know you

2012
01:30:54,221 --> 01:30:55,301
Hit him

2013
01:30:55,341 --> 01:30:57,901
Heard you call yourself
Oscar Anand in town

2014
01:30:58,661 --> 01:31:00,861
Who is he playing with?
Ask him to behave himself

2015
01:31:00,886 --> 01:31:03,446
Otherwise I'll arrest your son under
a terrorist case and put him behind bars

2016
01:31:03,471 --> 01:31:06,111
Das, are you threatening me
by bringing the police along?

2017
01:31:06,206 --> 01:31:07,035
Got it, right?

2018
01:31:07,110 --> 01:31:08,710
What did my brother do
that was so wrong?

2019
01:31:08,735 --> 01:31:11,815
We are getting complaints of him
teasing the girls on the road

2020
01:31:11,887 --> 01:31:13,007
If he doesn't behave...

2021
01:31:13,032 --> 01:31:14,512
...I'll put him in jail
under eve teasing

2022
01:31:14,537 --> 01:31:15,817
We were better off

2023
01:31:16,017 --> 01:31:17,937
They threatened
your bro in the shop

2024
01:31:18,609 --> 01:31:19,929
What does your brother
think of himself?

2025
01:31:20,024 --> 01:31:21,864
Just because a few
pipsqueaks follow him...

2026
01:31:21,998 --> 01:31:23,758
...he thinks he can blast anyone?

2027
01:31:24,072 --> 01:31:25,712
His good time, he escaped

2028
01:31:27,021 --> 01:31:28,890
If you want him to be alive,
I should never see him again

2029
01:31:28,915 --> 01:31:31,355
Okay, Das, I'll ensure he doesn't
mess with anyone in the future

2030
01:31:31,481 --> 01:31:33,881
Your brother knows me
only as a politician

2031
01:31:34,110 --> 01:31:36,150
But you're aware of my past, right?

2032
01:31:36,175 --> 01:31:37,935
- I do
- Warn him then

2033
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:39,840
If he threatens,
will you get scared?

2034
01:31:39,865 --> 01:31:42,265
Today he'll build a factory here,
claiming the water is good

2035
01:31:42,360 --> 01:31:45,160
Then he will ask us to evacuate
claiming there is granite under our houses

2036
01:31:45,286 --> 01:31:46,646
Just keep gaping!

2037
01:31:47,016 --> 01:31:48,336
Only because you are scared...

2038
01:31:48,361 --> 01:31:50,241
...they get the courage
for more misdeeds

2039
01:31:50,415 --> 01:31:53,245
If we strike back at one
of them, it's enough

2040
01:31:55,615 --> 01:31:57,615
Uncle, how did you
allow them to build?

2041
01:31:57,640 --> 01:32:01,360
They think if they build
no one can do anything

2042
01:32:01,385 --> 01:32:04,594
Even if they go to the Supreme court
the case will only favor us

2043
01:32:04,662 --> 01:32:05,702
If we wait for a verdict...

2044
01:32:05,758 --> 01:32:08,157
...it will keep dragging until
his grandchildren run the factory

2045
01:32:08,182 --> 01:32:12,408
In the court, the Commissioner, Tahsildar,
Collector have joined hands with Das

2046
01:32:12,939 --> 01:32:14,819
And claimed this is Govt land

2047
01:32:14,938 --> 01:32:16,458
They are lying
through their teeth

2048
01:32:16,808 --> 01:32:19,688
They are thinking of
this ground as an ordinary one

2049
01:32:19,712 --> 01:32:21,712
The British played cricket here

2050
01:32:21,902 --> 01:32:27,502
In 1932 in the Municipality layout
it clearly says it's a public ground

2051
01:32:27,581 --> 01:32:29,949
Uncle, are they building here
without knowing all this?

2052
01:32:29,974 --> 01:32:31,174
Of course they know

2053
01:32:31,518 --> 01:32:33,941
But they would've assumed
no one will find these records

2054
01:32:33,966 --> 01:32:34,766
Will I leave it?

2055
01:32:34,887 --> 01:32:36,367
I unearthed every single document

2056
01:32:36,392 --> 01:32:37,752
The lawyer himself was stunned

2057
01:32:37,878 --> 01:32:40,874
If we submit these records in court
and get demolition order...

2058
01:32:41,137 --> 01:32:43,617
...Govt will bring it down
without us spending a rupee!

2059
01:32:43,783 --> 01:32:46,053
Then we can just watch
with our arms folded happily

2060
01:32:46,110 --> 01:32:48,270
Uncle, say something
that's feasible please

2061
01:32:48,295 --> 01:32:50,255
Don't get tensed

2062
01:32:50,280 --> 01:32:51,960
Take care of the festival work

2063
01:32:51,985 --> 01:32:53,585
Pugazh, you focus on
your engagement

2064
01:32:53,718 --> 01:32:55,398
I'll deal with this completely

2065
01:33:13,581 --> 01:33:14,621
Hey! Stop

2066
01:33:14,861 --> 01:33:17,341
Why did you come here?
What were you doing all along?

2067
01:33:18,786 --> 01:33:20,426
I can hear raised voices

2068
01:33:20,781 --> 01:33:21,861
'Wait'

2069
01:33:21,941 --> 01:33:23,061
Our friends?

2070
01:33:23,101 --> 01:33:24,221
I'm telling you to wait

2071
01:33:24,261 --> 01:33:25,960
Venkat, where were you
all these days?

2072
01:33:25,985 --> 01:33:27,025
Think you're a big shot?

2073
01:33:27,106 --> 01:33:28,866
You know who helped you
to become the councilor!

2074
01:33:28,898 --> 01:33:30,658
Take your hands off
Who are you to butt in?

2075
01:33:30,901 --> 01:33:32,341
Wait, let's talk to him

2076
01:33:32,421 --> 01:33:34,301
(raised voices)

2077
01:33:34,681 --> 01:33:36,361
Get out of here

2078
01:33:36,464 --> 01:33:39,264
Get out of this place

2079
01:33:39,327 --> 01:33:41,127
Can't you hear us?
Just wait

2080
01:33:41,261 --> 01:33:43,421
You came to check
if he's still alive?

2081
01:33:43,501 --> 01:33:45,141
You call yourself a friend!

2082
01:33:46,056 --> 01:33:48,296
Hey! Wait

2083
01:33:48,901 --> 01:33:51,381
Why did you come here?

2084
01:33:53,741 --> 01:33:55,141
Let go of him

2085
01:33:55,751 --> 01:33:57,191
Want to drink?

2086
01:34:00,747 --> 01:34:04,467
When I said I'll resign,
Das took me directly to the minister

2087
01:34:04,581 --> 01:34:06,621
They chatted
for a long time

2088
01:34:07,005 --> 01:34:08,257
Don't know what they spoke

2089
01:34:08,282 --> 01:34:10,242
Then they detained me at the quarry

2090
01:34:10,558 --> 01:34:12,358
You told me to run over
the old man and I did

2091
01:34:12,399 --> 01:34:13,799
Before you hit the old man...

2092
01:34:13,886 --> 01:34:16,206
...he filed a habeas corpus
saying that Venkat is missing

2093
01:34:16,231 --> 01:34:18,359
If I release Venkat, he'll join
with Pugazh and say he'll resign

2094
01:34:18,384 --> 01:34:20,264
Then I'll be minus a job
Your job also won't get done

2095
01:34:20,377 --> 01:34:21,657
If you handle politics like this...

2096
01:34:21,682 --> 01:34:23,162
...not 30 but even after 300 years

2097
01:34:23,201 --> 01:34:24,881
...you won't reach the top, got it?

2098
01:34:24,922 --> 01:34:25,962
Open the door

2099
01:34:28,830 --> 01:34:30,350
Hey, get up

2100
01:34:33,593 --> 01:34:35,593
Bro, leave

2101
01:34:35,808 --> 01:34:37,928
Don't tell anyone you were here

2102
01:34:38,146 --> 01:34:40,426
If anyone asks you,
just say you went out of town

2103
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:41,960
Get it?

2104
01:34:42,608 --> 01:34:44,048
Why are you staring?

2105
01:34:44,705 --> 01:34:47,425
Do you know how much he has
struggled to become the chairman?

2106
01:34:47,646 --> 01:34:51,926
If you resign listening to some chap,
we'll be really mad at you

2107
01:34:51,951 --> 01:34:54,671
No one who has come
into this room has left here alive

2108
01:34:54,696 --> 01:34:59,296
He has to hold on to his chairman post
That's why you're getting out alive

2109
01:34:59,711 --> 01:35:03,911
Not understanding that, if you resign
listening to some idiot...

2110
01:35:03,936 --> 01:35:05,096
...not only you

2111
01:35:05,121 --> 01:35:07,081
But your entire family won't be alive

2112
01:35:07,113 --> 01:35:08,993
I swear I didn't attack you

2113
01:35:09,733 --> 01:35:11,133
I know

2114
01:35:16,254 --> 01:35:17,734
We shouldn't give up, Pugazh

2115
01:35:17,759 --> 01:35:20,679
This land is a cut above
our own mother

2116
01:35:20,704 --> 01:35:23,504
A mother will feed only
her children and raise them

2117
01:35:23,529 --> 01:35:26,409
But this land feeds and
nurtures the whole town

2118
01:35:26,434 --> 01:35:28,914
Only if we maintain and protect
the soil where we played...

2119
01:35:28,939 --> 01:35:30,579
...our generation will be saved!

2120
01:35:31,953 --> 01:35:33,553
On one side...

2121
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:36,280
...greedy men demolish mountains
and destroy nature

2122
01:35:36,390 --> 01:35:40,870
On the other side, thoughtless men
rake river sand and ruin agriculture

2123
01:35:40,895 --> 01:35:43,408
Trees buried in this land
many years ago...

2124
01:35:43,557 --> 01:35:45,091
...one fine day shine like a diamond

2125
01:35:45,134 --> 01:35:47,214
But having been born
and raised in this land...

2126
01:35:47,239 --> 01:35:48,879
...if we give up,
how will it be?

2127
01:36:01,301 --> 01:36:03,061
(loud lament)

2128
01:36:10,741 --> 01:36:11,941
Come and eat

2129
01:36:12,021 --> 01:36:13,781
Please come

2130
01:36:14,421 --> 01:36:15,781
Lakshmi, attend to them

2131
01:36:16,661 --> 01:36:18,061
Everyone will be angry

2132
01:36:18,101 --> 01:36:20,861
They will be spoiling for a fight
but don't speak unnecessarily

2133
01:36:31,421 --> 01:36:34,541
(lamenting continues)

2134
01:36:44,581 --> 01:36:45,941
Share with everyone

2135
01:36:47,869 --> 01:36:49,589
How dare you
swear at us!

2136
01:36:49,614 --> 01:36:50,494
Leave it

2137
01:36:50,519 --> 01:36:51,919
He said something
out of anger

2138
01:36:51,944 --> 01:36:53,344
If you allow him,
he'll continue to talk

2139
01:36:53,501 --> 01:36:54,402
What does that mean?

2140
01:36:54,603 --> 01:36:56,417
If that man was alive, he would have
submitted all the details to the court

2141
01:36:56,653 --> 01:36:57,933
So you ran over him

2142
01:36:58,459 --> 01:37:01,253
Looks like you'll blame me for
all the 'hit and run' cases in this town!

2143
01:37:01,294 --> 01:37:04,134
Das, why are you arguing
during a funeral?

2144
01:37:04,254 --> 01:37:05,574
He is spoiling for a fight

2145
01:37:05,818 --> 01:37:06,898
Who is creating a ruckus?

2146
01:37:06,923 --> 01:37:09,043
You think we don't know
about the lorries in your quarry?

2147
01:37:09,138 --> 01:37:11,218
Sonny, don't let
your tongue run

2148
01:37:11,297 --> 01:37:14,417
You think we aren't aware of what
you and that minister's son-in-law do?

2149
01:37:14,621 --> 01:37:15,421
Stop it, go now

2150
01:37:15,461 --> 01:37:16,743
Let me speak, anna
He thinks we are all fool-

2151
01:37:16,768 --> 01:37:17,728
Take him with you

2152
01:37:17,753 --> 01:37:19,153
Taking the common people
for a solid ride

2153
01:37:19,312 --> 01:37:21,272
- This isn't looking good, Arasu
- You leave now, Das

2154
01:37:21,297 --> 01:37:23,577
The support from his clan and friends
is kindling his temper

2155
01:37:23,602 --> 01:37:24,842
Not at all
You leave

2156
01:37:24,867 --> 01:37:27,627
If I nod my head, my men
will chop your brother to pieces

2157
01:37:27,728 --> 01:37:29,608
Then the funeral
will be in your house!

2158
01:37:30,941 --> 01:37:32,421
'Inform your brother'

2159
01:37:32,446 --> 01:37:33,703
What a prize catch!

2160
01:37:33,728 --> 01:37:35,048
If your brother had seen this...

2161
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:37,640
...he would have
brought the roof down

2162
01:37:38,150 --> 01:37:40,630
Here, chop him

2163
01:37:41,890 --> 01:37:43,210
Hack him, I say

2164
01:37:43,352 --> 01:37:45,072
Think we won't fight back?

2165
01:37:45,097 --> 01:37:47,177
Threatening us
at the drop of a hat!

2166
01:37:47,381 --> 01:37:48,948
We don't collect others' money
and eat like you do

2167
01:37:49,084 --> 01:37:50,684
We work hard for a living

2168
01:37:50,709 --> 01:37:52,149
Only today you have
become the chairman

2169
01:37:52,174 --> 01:37:54,254
Don't we know
how you were before?

2170
01:37:54,636 --> 01:37:55,836
If you were above board...

2171
01:37:56,001 --> 01:37:57,641
...why will he cross your path?

2172
01:37:57,991 --> 01:38:00,591
My father hasn't given birth
to a coward of a son

2173
01:38:00,741 --> 01:38:02,741
Arasu, you told him not to shout
and you're doing just that

2174
01:38:02,781 --> 01:38:04,821
He only knows to threaten
with violence and murder

2175
01:38:04,846 --> 01:38:06,446
- You'll both lose respect
- Get lost!

2176
01:38:06,471 --> 01:38:07,951
You think you can
get away with this?

2177
01:38:08,061 --> 01:38:09,341
I'll kill you both

2178
01:38:09,381 --> 01:38:10,541
Whom do you take me for?

2179
01:38:10,621 --> 01:38:11,901
Clear out, you wimp

2180
01:38:11,981 --> 01:38:14,621
Arasu, go home
Pugazh, take him home

2181
01:38:15,879 --> 01:38:17,679
Why are you behaving like this?

2182
01:38:17,943 --> 01:38:21,223
How many times to tell you
he's a dangerous person?

2183
01:38:21,661 --> 01:38:23,697
Aren't you worried
about our family?

2184
01:38:23,722 --> 01:38:27,442
Is it fair on your part to do this
with your engagement 4 days away?

2185
01:38:27,534 --> 01:38:29,774
You go with him everywhere
like a cow in the temple

2186
01:38:29,815 --> 01:38:30,735
Won't you advise him?

2187
01:38:30,760 --> 01:38:31,456
What are you saying, anna?

2188
01:38:31,535 --> 01:38:33,855
I can't keep watching
such atrocities and keep quiet

2189
01:38:36,761 --> 01:38:37,961
Waste of time

2190
01:38:38,181 --> 01:38:40,421
I won't talk about this
to you again

2191
01:38:41,235 --> 01:38:42,715
You decide

2192
01:38:43,096 --> 01:38:45,096
If other people's problems
are priority to you...

2193
01:38:45,317 --> 01:38:46,717
...don't come home

2194
01:38:47,025 --> 01:38:48,105
Go away

2195
01:38:48,741 --> 01:38:50,061
Go away from here

2196
01:38:51,461 --> 01:38:53,901
You heard him, bro

2197
01:38:54,321 --> 01:38:57,081
How many times
do I repeat the same thing?

2198
01:38:57,863 --> 01:38:59,223
Am I saying all this for my sake?

2199
01:38:59,381 --> 01:39:01,701
I want him to be
safe and happy

2200
01:39:03,304 --> 01:39:04,944
He humiliates me

2201
01:39:06,981 --> 01:39:10,821
Pugazh and other parties intend
protesting in front of that building

2202
01:39:10,871 --> 01:39:12,631
- is that right?
- Yes, bro

2203
01:39:13,061 --> 01:39:14,972
When they all joined hands
and fought with me...

2204
01:39:14,997 --> 01:39:16,757
...I knew something
like this was brewing

2205
01:39:16,912 --> 01:39:18,112
When is this event?

2206
01:39:18,137 --> 01:39:19,737
Sunday is Pugazh's engagement

2207
01:39:19,902 --> 01:39:21,782
They are planning
to protest on Monday

2208
01:39:50,661 --> 01:39:53,021
We made this
for the bride

2209
01:39:53,661 --> 01:39:55,301
Selvi, someone is calling Pugazh

2210
01:39:55,341 --> 01:39:56,295
Go and give him the phone

2211
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:57,720
Aunty, keep this

2212
01:40:01,740 --> 01:40:04,180
- What?
- Pugazh anna has got a call

2213
01:40:04,221 --> 01:40:05,381
Tell me

2214
01:40:06,005 --> 01:40:08,165
Anna, Bhuvana akka

2215
01:40:51,661 --> 01:40:53,821
No need, bro
It's very risky

2216
01:40:53,861 --> 01:40:56,164
If something goes wrong,
they will burn me alive

2217
01:40:56,189 --> 01:40:58,437
I'll make sure
you are safe

2218
01:40:58,473 --> 01:40:59,633
Go ahead boldly

2219
01:41:06,892 --> 01:41:08,812
How dare you break
our leader's statue?

2220
01:41:08,837 --> 01:41:12,277
(commotion)

2221
01:41:30,261 --> 01:41:32,352
You seem to be celebrating
the engagement like a wedding?

2222
01:41:32,377 --> 01:41:33,857
Even the bride's family asked me this

2223
01:41:33,882 --> 01:41:35,282
I believe their relatives are abroad

2224
01:41:35,307 --> 01:41:37,427
They want the wedding
to be conducted in Madras

2225
01:41:37,624 --> 01:41:38,904
My brother wanted it this way

2226
01:41:38,929 --> 01:41:42,209
That's why I decided to conduct
the engagement in a grand manner

2227
01:41:42,234 --> 01:41:43,634
Madam, call Arasu

2228
01:41:43,861 --> 01:41:45,861
Selvi, call anna

2229
01:41:48,501 --> 01:41:50,913
They want you in
for the rituals

2230
01:41:50,938 --> 01:41:52,418
Attend to our guests

2231
01:41:52,530 --> 01:41:53,530
Greetings

2232
01:41:53,969 --> 01:41:55,387
Where is your sister-in-law go?

2233
01:41:55,412 --> 01:41:56,852
- Call her immediately
- I forgot

2234
01:41:56,941 --> 01:41:58,861
Read the engagement
announcement once

2235
01:42:02,857 --> 01:42:03,857
Anand

2236
01:42:03,882 --> 01:42:05,042
Anna is calling you

2237
01:42:05,067 --> 01:42:07,387
Get 2 litres bottled drinks immediately

2238
01:42:08,088 --> 01:42:09,528
Sit next to me

2239
01:42:11,301 --> 01:42:12,541
Will you just shut up?

2240
01:42:14,901 --> 01:42:15,901
What is the rush?

2241
01:42:16,066 --> 01:42:17,596
Do you know what is
happening outside?

2242
01:42:17,621 --> 01:42:19,501
They have literally
organized a riot

2243
01:42:19,541 --> 01:42:21,301
- Who?
- Das's men

2244
01:42:21,781 --> 01:42:23,628
It seems someone cracked
their leader's statue

2245
01:42:23,671 --> 01:42:25,191
So they are breaking all the shops

2246
01:42:25,216 --> 01:42:26,936
They are coming this way

2247
01:42:28,421 --> 01:42:30,741
When we are all here
why tell him specifically?

2248
01:42:30,821 --> 01:42:32,741
You have no idea of the danger

2249
01:42:37,461 --> 01:42:38,821
Who are you?

2250
01:42:38,861 --> 01:42:40,461
Why are you coming in here?

2251
01:42:42,101 --> 01:42:43,141
Who the hell are you?

2252
01:42:43,221 --> 01:42:44,581
How can you barge in?

2253
01:42:46,901 --> 01:42:48,381
Keep quiet, dude

2254
01:42:50,941 --> 01:42:52,381
Stay right here

2255
01:43:04,781 --> 01:43:07,141
Bhuvana akka, please wait

2256
01:43:37,141 --> 01:43:39,021
Catch him, Arasu

2257
01:44:22,901 --> 01:44:23,790
Bhuvana, come inside

2258
01:44:24,009 --> 01:44:26,661
We have enough problems
and you want to call him?

2259
01:44:33,120 --> 01:44:34,080
Hello

2260
01:44:34,105 --> 01:44:35,145
You are so stubborn

2261
01:44:35,176 --> 01:44:36,256
You don't listen to anyone

2262
01:44:36,281 --> 01:44:37,721
My brother predicted this

2263
01:44:37,934 --> 01:44:39,494
When everyone told you
to stay calm...

2264
01:44:39,581 --> 01:44:41,101
...you went on fighting

2265
01:44:41,821 --> 01:44:43,341
Yes, what do you
want me to do?

2266
01:44:43,381 --> 01:44:44,901
Won't you think about anyone?

2267
01:44:44,941 --> 01:44:45,901
No, I won't

2268
01:44:54,781 --> 01:44:55,701
Careful!

2269
01:44:55,741 --> 01:44:58,621
Hey Anand! You want a feast
lend us a proper hand

2270
01:44:58,661 --> 01:45:00,221
My arms hurt
Lower it down

2271
01:45:00,301 --> 01:45:01,421
He's such a weakling!

2272
01:45:01,501 --> 01:45:02,701
Place it on the ground

2273
01:45:04,690 --> 01:45:07,021
Hey! Come and help us
It's so goddamn heavy

2274
01:45:07,061 --> 01:45:07,941
Just lift and go

2275
01:45:07,981 --> 01:45:09,221
Let me go and fetch him

2276
01:45:09,661 --> 01:45:11,301
Anand, don't pretend to lift

2277
01:45:11,341 --> 01:45:13,021
Why this long face?

2278
01:45:14,148 --> 01:45:18,101
From childhood I should've maintained
my distance from my uncle and father

2279
01:45:18,179 --> 01:45:19,779
Still brooding about it?

2280
01:45:20,068 --> 01:45:21,708
Help us with the festival preparations

2281
01:45:21,733 --> 01:45:23,341
2 days and everything
will fall in place

2282
01:45:23,381 --> 01:45:26,581
I am trying to be aloof

2283
01:45:27,124 --> 01:45:28,284
I'm unable to

2284
01:45:28,309 --> 01:45:30,884
Do you know how often
I have wanted to be as bold as you?

2285
01:45:30,916 --> 01:45:31,756
I simply can't

2286
01:45:31,781 --> 01:45:32,621
Fear

2287
01:45:33,671 --> 01:45:36,071
The boys are coming here
Don't let them see you like this

2288
01:45:36,096 --> 01:45:37,822
They'll be upset and
everything will go for a toss

2289
01:45:37,847 --> 01:45:39,662
Das and the minister will
have the upper hand

2290
01:45:39,737 --> 01:45:42,657
We should retain our playground
Think of a plan to save it

2291
01:45:43,577 --> 01:45:45,371
'Ladies and gentlemen'

2292
01:45:45,396 --> 01:45:47,916
'Tomorrow night
at Wallajah bus depot...'

2293
01:45:47,941 --> 01:45:50,941
'...a public meeting has been convened
to elaborate the plans of the Govt'

2294
01:45:50,981 --> 01:45:53,381
'Since ministers and
dignitaries will be present...'

2295
01:45:53,421 --> 01:45:57,741
'...we request you to make it
a special event with your presence'

2296
01:45:58,916 --> 01:46:04,580
'Our party's pillar of strength
Honorable minister for education'

2297
01:46:04,963 --> 01:46:12,053
'Brave-Heart Mr Balaraman
and our district collector'

2298
01:46:26,421 --> 01:46:31,701
'I request Hon'ble minister
Mr M.Ramaswamy'

2299
01:46:31,771 --> 01:46:33,971
'...to come on to the stage'

2300
01:46:43,021 --> 01:46:47,901
'My dear brother Das
invited me to speak in Wallajah'

2301
01:46:48,216 --> 01:46:50,896
'I never imagined it would be
on such a grand scale'

2302
01:46:53,862 --> 01:46:57,782
'If I elaborate on
our party's achievements'

2303
01:46:57,807 --> 01:47:00,847
'...we would be here
whole of tonight!'

2304
01:47:23,581 --> 01:47:28,701
'When students from lower middle class
strata of society need to study higher'

2305
01:47:28,848 --> 01:47:32,101
'...they can directly contact banks
which will offer loans-'

2306
01:47:32,141 --> 01:47:35,461
'To offer student loans to-'

2307
01:47:35,501 --> 01:47:37,551
Pugazh went with a big gang
and his friends to the playground

2308
01:47:37,772 --> 01:47:39,492
And razed our building to the ground

2309
01:47:39,649 --> 01:47:40,649
What do you mean?

2310
01:47:40,744 --> 01:47:42,784
I got the information just now

2311
01:47:44,261 --> 01:47:45,941
Round up all the boys

2312
01:47:46,661 --> 01:47:53,621
'I am very happy to announce
I will make it happen within my tenure'

2313
01:47:58,661 --> 01:48:00,221
Stop...stop

2314
01:48:06,594 --> 01:48:08,354
That Inspector is looking for us

2315
01:48:08,379 --> 01:48:10,779
If he nabs any of us
he will skin us alive

2316
01:48:10,876 --> 01:48:12,316
Call the others

2317
01:48:12,341 --> 01:48:13,981
Tell them the cops
are searching for us

2318
01:48:14,192 --> 01:48:16,661
Tell them not to go home tonight
Let them stay somewhere outside

2319
01:48:16,701 --> 01:48:19,181
And meet up tomorrow
at the temple festival venue

2320
01:48:19,221 --> 01:48:21,781
Our people will be around
The police can't touch us then

2321
01:48:21,821 --> 01:48:23,141
Don't forget
Watch your back

2322
01:48:23,181 --> 01:48:25,181
Careful
Be safe

2323
01:48:34,944 --> 01:48:36,701
I trusted you and now
it has all gone for a toss

2324
01:48:36,781 --> 01:48:39,101
Look at them standing here
like thick skinned buffaloes

2325
01:48:39,181 --> 01:48:41,063
Till they demolished it
were you sucking your thumb?

2326
01:48:41,088 --> 01:48:42,928
We were out numbered
10 up against 100

2327
01:48:42,965 --> 01:48:45,125
They thrashed us like
a tsunami and disappeared

2328
01:48:45,150 --> 01:48:46,910
You claimed not 1 chap will turn up

2329
01:48:47,186 --> 01:48:50,706
And you had chased them away
Look what they have done now

2330
01:48:51,294 --> 01:48:53,692
I thought they are just boys and
my threats would scare them away

2331
01:48:53,741 --> 01:48:56,181
Lamest excuse ever!
If you had killed 2 of them...

2332
01:48:56,261 --> 01:48:57,497
...would they have
dared to barge in here?

2333
01:48:57,663 --> 01:48:58,943
How many of them?

2334
01:48:59,530 --> 01:49:01,890
100-200 good-for-nothing boys?

2335
01:49:01,915 --> 01:49:03,635
Ask the Inspector to nab them

2336
01:49:03,833 --> 01:49:05,381
I already did
He's on the job

2337
01:49:06,257 --> 01:49:07,701
I shouldn't have trusted you

2338
01:49:07,781 --> 01:49:09,741
I should have done this myself

2339
01:49:09,821 --> 01:49:14,141
I didn't want the Press and media
to go on a 'ripping me apart' spree

2340
01:49:14,261 --> 01:49:16,461
That's why I called you
Now I'll take over

2341
01:49:16,996 --> 01:49:18,196
Inspector has come

2342
01:49:18,221 --> 01:49:19,141
Sir

2343
01:49:20,402 --> 01:49:22,202
What happened?

2344
01:49:22,227 --> 01:49:23,747
Not a single boy
is out on the roads

2345
01:49:23,781 --> 01:49:25,061
They have all gone into hiding

2346
01:49:25,226 --> 01:49:26,581
He says this all the time

2347
01:49:26,621 --> 01:49:29,021
If you file a case against them
for demolishing your building...

2348
01:49:29,101 --> 01:49:30,381
...I can bring the offenders in

2349
01:49:30,413 --> 01:49:31,853
And beat them up
black and blue

2350
01:49:31,901 --> 01:49:32,841
They will confess automatically

2351
01:49:32,939 --> 01:49:34,419
Are you out of your mind?

2352
01:49:34,701 --> 01:49:36,901
You want me to complain
claiming ownership of this land?

2353
01:49:36,926 --> 01:49:38,526
The title deed is not yet ready

2354
01:49:38,724 --> 01:49:39,621
I'll handle that, bro

2355
01:49:39,661 --> 01:49:40,701
Fat hopes you will!

2356
01:49:40,741 --> 01:49:45,261
I'll bring my men from Chennai
and rebuild in this same spot

2357
01:49:45,301 --> 01:49:47,341
Let me see who will
dare to barge in again!

2358
01:49:47,381 --> 01:49:48,301
Brother...?

2359
01:50:09,381 --> 01:50:10,341
Yes, sir

2360
01:50:10,381 --> 01:50:12,301
I'm waiting at the High school

2361
01:50:12,621 --> 01:50:13,661
Come soon

2362
01:50:24,141 --> 01:50:25,861
Pull up on the left

2363
01:50:53,040 --> 01:50:55,840
Minister has brought his men
from Chennai to rebuild

2364
01:50:56,463 --> 01:50:59,141
If Pugazh finds out, he will create
trouble again with his gang of boys

2365
01:50:59,181 --> 01:51:00,781
I can't face the minister's wrath

2366
01:51:00,821 --> 01:51:04,307
With this temple festival as an excuse
if we kill Pugazh and Venkat...

2367
01:51:04,332 --> 01:51:05,892
...they will be terrified of us

2368
01:51:06,979 --> 01:51:08,941
We can close the file saying
commotion during the festival

2369
01:51:08,981 --> 01:51:10,621
Don't do anything
during the festival

2370
01:51:10,661 --> 01:51:11,161
Then?

2371
01:51:11,240 --> 01:51:12,360
Situation isn't alright

2372
01:51:12,385 --> 01:51:14,945
Superintendent of Police is here
Problem will get aggravated, sir

2373
01:51:14,970 --> 01:51:17,330
The minister is really mad at me

2374
01:51:17,636 --> 01:51:19,556
I'm balancing it with
his son-in-law's support

2375
01:51:19,890 --> 01:51:23,090
If those boys cause trouble
it's the end of my political career

2376
01:51:23,115 --> 01:51:24,755
Please understand
my predicament

2377
01:51:26,281 --> 01:51:28,661
I know what you are going through

2378
01:51:29,940 --> 01:51:31,341
Don't choose
the temple as your venue

2379
01:51:31,381 --> 01:51:33,541
When the deity is being taken
on a procession in the streets...

2380
01:51:33,636 --> 01:51:36,196
...send in your men
We will turn a blind eye

2381
01:51:38,679 --> 01:51:40,759
Stick to the boys
to be on the safe side

2382
01:51:40,901 --> 01:51:43,541
I think we'll conduct the festival
without any serious hassles

2383
01:51:46,421 --> 01:51:48,981
Ask the boys to burst the crackers
a little ahead of the procession

2384
01:51:49,021 --> 01:51:50,941
Ezhumalai bought fireworks
for just 200 bucks

2385
01:51:50,981 --> 01:51:52,701
What does it matter
where we burst?

2386
01:51:53,141 --> 01:51:55,221
Careful, you might
scorch your fingers

2387
01:51:56,941 --> 01:51:59,861
I have told the priest to
garland on our behalf

2388
01:51:59,901 --> 01:52:01,141
Okay

2389
01:52:04,821 --> 01:52:06,581
Why is he ignoring me?

2390
01:52:06,661 --> 01:52:08,461
Oh gawd! Power cut all of a sudden

2391
01:52:08,541 --> 01:52:09,981
Don't know what's happening

2392
01:52:15,181 --> 01:52:16,421
Listen to me

2393
01:52:16,461 --> 01:52:19,061
- Go inside
- Brother...?

2394
01:52:23,541 --> 01:52:26,141
They are building again
in our playground

2395
01:52:27,061 --> 01:52:28,741
They have pulled out
all the electric cables

2396
01:52:28,781 --> 01:52:29,981
Call the electrician

2397
01:52:41,141 --> 01:52:44,501
Pugazh, someone has
attacked your brother

2398
01:52:52,661 --> 01:52:53,941
- Anna!
- Venky

2399
01:52:53,981 --> 01:52:55,621
Get some vehicle

2400
01:52:58,381 --> 01:52:59,861
I told you not to get involved

2401
01:52:59,941 --> 01:53:01,261
Did you listen to me?

2402
01:53:02,981 --> 01:53:04,341
Heartless fellows!

2403
01:53:04,762 --> 01:53:06,402
Call the ambulance, Pugazh

2404
01:53:06,427 --> 01:53:07,707
Don't worry

2405
01:53:07,906 --> 01:53:09,706
Get the car

2406
01:53:17,741 --> 01:53:20,261
Bro, Pugazh is coming to kill you

2407
01:53:20,981 --> 01:53:22,661
Watch out, bro

2408
01:53:23,981 --> 01:53:25,621
Run...run away, bro

2409
01:53:28,061 --> 01:53:29,981
Bro, leave the place

2410
01:53:32,581 --> 01:53:34,301
Muruga, kill him

2411
01:53:53,941 --> 01:53:56,101
Babu, finish him off

2412
01:54:52,621 --> 01:54:54,541
Finish him off

2413
01:55:07,301 --> 01:55:08,941
Kill him, Babu

2414
01:56:07,781 --> 01:56:09,941
Don't hurt me, Pugazh

2415
01:56:09,981 --> 01:56:12,021
He and the minister are
responsible for everything

2416
01:56:12,046 --> 01:56:14,166
Only because rogues like you
hanker after pittance...

2417
01:56:14,191 --> 01:56:15,791
...they get away
with their crimes

2418
01:56:15,816 --> 01:56:17,418
Don't kill me

2419
01:56:17,581 --> 01:56:18,941
You know why I did it

2420
01:56:19,036 --> 01:56:20,956
If I hadn't someone else
would have pitched in

2421
01:56:20,981 --> 01:56:23,141
I've never earned a rupee
in my political career so far

2422
01:56:23,221 --> 01:56:26,301
They promised to settle me well
in life if I clinch this deal for them

2423
01:56:26,341 --> 01:56:28,061
Wanting a better life
I succumbed

2424
01:56:28,101 --> 01:56:31,181
Are we your target to satisfy
your wants and greed?

2425
01:56:40,925 --> 01:56:42,301
What do you think of yourself?

2426
01:56:42,432 --> 01:56:45,181
You ruined our agriculture
by robbing our river banks of sand

2427
01:56:45,221 --> 01:56:47,701
On another side, you blast
the mountains around our town

2428
01:56:47,741 --> 01:56:50,061
You filled up lakes
and ponds to build colleges

2429
01:56:51,701 --> 01:56:54,821
On top of it, trying to grab
our playground with your greedy hands?

2430
01:56:54,861 --> 01:56:56,221
If someone opposes you...

2431
01:56:56,436 --> 01:56:57,956
...you'll resort to vile threats

2432
01:56:57,981 --> 01:57:00,221
If we don't bow down
once for all you'll finish us off

2433
01:57:00,261 --> 01:57:02,341
You're so damn sure
no one will oppose you

2434
01:57:02,496 --> 01:57:03,581
I will make a new beginning

2435
01:57:03,621 --> 01:57:04,941
The way I hack you to pieces...

2436
01:57:04,966 --> 01:57:07,166
...no one will dare aspire
for another man's land

2437

2438

'6 months later'

2439
01:58:08,461 --> 01:58:12,861
'In the riot that happened
at Wallajapet temple festival...'

2440
01:58:12,941 --> 01:58:17,701
'...due to lack of adequate evidence
beyond reasonable doubt'

2441
01:58:17,876 --> 01:58:21,236
'Pugazh the alleged culprit
and his accomplices'

2442
01:58:21,261 --> 01:58:23,563
'...are freed by this Court of law'

2443
01:58:24,008 --> 01:58:25,789
In this happy moment...

2444
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:29,941
...I wish to share with all of you
this heart-warming piece of news

2445
01:58:29,981 --> 01:58:34,261
When I was elected as the MLA
of this constituency...

2446
01:58:34,631 --> 01:58:39,381
...volunteer Selva gave me a petition
asking for a playground here

2447
01:58:39,803 --> 01:58:44,901
I decided I should do some good deed
for the people who made me win

2448
01:58:44,981 --> 01:58:48,901
The result is the foundation stone
for this stadium today

2449
01:58:53,293 --> 01:58:54,661
Pugazh has become
a family man

2450
01:58:54,741 --> 01:58:56,855
Anand, hereafter you are the captain

2451
01:58:57,066 --> 01:58:57,661
You can treat-

2452
01:58:57,701 --> 01:58:58,941
Don't shoot off your mouth

2453
01:58:58,981 --> 01:59:01,061
How many times you've
promised I'm the captain...

2454
01:59:01,101 --> 01:59:02,261
...and got drunk like a skunk

2455
01:59:02,341 --> 01:59:03,181
Next morning-

2456
01:59:03,221 --> 01:59:04,861
Acting like you are on cloud 9

2457
01:59:04,901 --> 01:59:06,341
Aren't you feeling jealous of us?

2458
01:59:06,381 --> 01:59:08,024
He switches on his FM channel
he won't zip his lips

2459
01:59:08,049 --> 01:59:10,689
- His wife is 'All India Radio'
- These boys are up to No good

2460
01:59:10,714 --> 01:59:12,114
Go and attend to your work

2461
01:59:13,461 --> 01:59:15,101
Pugazh, it seems
he's the next captain

2462
01:59:28,541 --> 01:59:32,901
"To Pondicherry by the sea
dude, come and join our party"

2463
01:59:34,941 --> 01:59:39,901
"No shortage of currency
Pull up your collar high and mighty"

2464
01:59:41,941 --> 01:59:45,421
"Not an ounce of worry
No trace of fear really"

2465
01:59:45,461 --> 01:59:48,901
"If friends support us
we'll rock on with success"

2466
01:59:48,941 --> 01:59:52,261
"Life is just a game
Let's play to make a name"

2467
01:59:52,301 --> 01:59:55,621
"If we strive high for a sixer
we'll be Sachin the master blaster"

2468
02:00:02,141 --> 02:00:03,101
"We are us"

2469
02:00:03,141 --> 02:00:04,021
"Ourselves"

2470
02:00:04,061 --> 02:00:04,781
"Lightweights"

2471
02:00:04,821 --> 02:00:05,621
"No regrets"

2472
02:00:05,701 --> 02:00:06,501
"Our antics"

2473
02:00:06,541 --> 02:00:07,501
"Wildly surface"

2474
02:00:07,541 --> 02:00:09,021
"King of our area in all ways"

2475
02:00:09,101 --> 02:00:09,821
"We are"

2476
02:00:09,861 --> 02:00:10,661
"Simply"

2477
02:00:10,701 --> 02:00:11,541
"Small fry"

2478
02:00:11,621 --> 02:00:12,421
"Nobody"

2479
02:00:12,501 --> 02:00:13,261
"Our revelry"

2480
02:00:13,301 --> 02:00:14,181
"Tomfoolery"

2481
02:00:14,261 --> 02:00:15,701
"But we rule the roost happily"
