1
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:20,396
Of all the girls in the world,
why did I fall in love with Jessie?

2
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:23,262
Presenting, Jessie.

3
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,300
Beautiful..

4
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:26,663
Classy..

5
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:27,898
Intelligent.

6
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:29,099
Class topper..

7
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:30,710
98.9 percent.

8
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,337
And sexy..

9
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:33,907
100 percent.

10
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:37,245
Even in a saree, she can give any
fashionably dressed girl a complex.

11
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:38,751
I'd take her home right now..

12
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:41,752
Give her the hundred and eleven
rupees as per the tradition..

13
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,549
And make her mine.

14
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:45,918
So what's the problem?

15
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,190
The problem is that she
is getting married today.

16
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,310
To someone else..

17
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:07,838
Not to me.

18
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:11,309
Sir, where are you going?

19
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:13,751
Nikhil, the A.D, is my friend.

20
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:15,513
There's no Nikhil here.

21
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:17,487
Hey Sachin! Sorry dude.

22
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,319
What is this, Nikhil?
No one knows you here!

23
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,483
Forget it, three
Khans are shooting here.

24
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:21,958
I've been waiting for half
an hour. I told you about him.

25
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:23,324
This is me, Sachin.

26
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:26,057
I'm an engineer. I even work
as one, but I can't keep a job.

27
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,200
I can't keep a job,
because my heart isn't into it.

28
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,864
My heart is into cinema.

29
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:31,668
I want to make movies.

30
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,129
I used to watch movies.

31
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,838
Now I want to make them

32
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,808
I didn't even realize
when cinema became my life.

33
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:41,341
Nor did I realize when
it became my problem 1.

34
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,241
"A lot of friends"

35
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:45,044
a lot of dreams..

36
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:46,443
And hope..

37
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:47,610
Such was life.

38
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:48,915
Anay sir, you're late.
Anyway good you're here.

39
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,056
Not today. I've got to jog today.

40
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:52,818
Come on, sir!
My arm is hurting.

41
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:54,415
Such a well-known
cameraman and you refuse cricket.

42
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:57,522
Films and cricket, what
more is there to India?!

43
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,792
You always play with my emotions,
Sachin Tendulkar.

44
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:08,335
Sir, most assistant directors
are related to actors or producers.

45
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:09,905
I don't stand a chance.

46
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:11,101
Whom will you assist?

47
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:14,009
Sir, Anurag Kashyap?

48
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:16,174
With him, your
life will become dark.

49
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:17,711
He's a good chap though.

50
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:18,976
It's your first movie

51
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:20,313
try something fresh.

52
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:21,678
Ramesh Sippy.

53
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:22,980
Rohan Sippy?

54
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:25,148
His father, Ramesh Sippy.

55
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:26,384
The Ramesh Sippy!

56
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:27,891
I'm the cameraman for his movie.

57
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,863
You'll learn a lot.

58
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:32,462
You'll get to work on
a big, colorful movie.

59
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:36,466
You know, Sholay,
Shakti.. getting it?

60
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:39,095
Right here.
Bungalow apartment in Juhu?

61
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:40,366
Holy mother of God! How come?

62
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:41,971
My dad's brains.

63
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,537
Redevelopment and all.

64
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:44,735
Really!

65
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,778
We've been here just a week
it's not even our own!

66
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,007
You'll get your own house as well.
For now, enjoy Juhu.

67
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:51,209
Bachchan sir's bungalow to the
left, my office to the right.

68
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:52,409
Drop by whenever you feel like.

69
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:54,484
Your dad seems quite smart.

70
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:56,419
I don't get why he doesn't
support your film-making.

71
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,012
That's what, sir! What do I do?

72
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:00,125
We'll figure
something out. First, lunch.

73
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,086
Mr. Anay..

74
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:05,022
We're among those people who..

75
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:09,661
Live simply and sleep soundly.

76
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:10,860
Yes, sir.

77
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:13,032
We don't even watch movies.

78
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:15,965
The last movie we saw was Sholay.

79
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:17,975
Sholay? - There's been no
real movie made after that..

80
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:19,169
Yes, true.

81
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:21,637
What a coincidence!

82
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:22,939
This is magic, sir.

83
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:27,478
I've recommended him to Ramesh
Sippy, the director of Sholay.

84
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,055
His comeback film.

85
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,686
His future is bright, sir.

86
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:31,881
What can I say!

87
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:33,220
Can you put that on stamp paper?

88
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:36,227
Sir, he's definitely capable.

89
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:37,487
I don't think so.

90
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:40,224
Sir, I know him well.
He's got potential.

91
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:41,864
I'm his father.

92
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,035
I also have some
idea of his potential.

93
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:45,866
Of course you do.

94
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:47,869
But, being a friend

95
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,767
I see a story-teller in him.

96
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,709
Everything seemed so difficult.

97
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,678
Life was a mess.

98
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:58,478
That's when I saw Jessie.

99
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:02,249
You can think everything
else through, but love..

100
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:04,556
Just happens.

101
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:06,484
Just like that.

102
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:08,888
Takes over your world
just like that.

103
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:13,059
Just one glance, and it
pours straight into your heart.

104
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:14,825
Abracadabra..

105
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,561
Whoosh..

106
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:18,994
Smile.. calm..

107
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,066
Magic.. music..

108
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,738
And in a flash

109
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:24,935
in a flash

110
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,703
in a flash.

111
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:30,607
You are in love.

112
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:33,049
I live upstairs.

113
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:21,327
What are you doing, Sachin?

114
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:22,629
What's going on?

115
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:25,738
Dad.. I'm writing a romantic scene.

116
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:28,607
Here, like this, dancing
in the middle of the road?

117
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:29,799
I'm getting the feel right.

118
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,444
What feel, you idiot?
Everyone's looking!

119
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:47,413
Mom, I'm home. What's there to eat?

120
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:06,885
She's a Malayali Christian.

121
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:08,779
Jessie.

122
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:10,280
Madrasi right?

123
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,255
Are all south Indians Madrasis?

124
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:15,554
She's from Kerala.

125
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,429
Isn't it the same thing?
Tell me more.

126
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:22,865
We're Marathi Konknastha Brahmins.
You remember that, right?

127
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,027
So?

128
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:26,529
Nothing can happen.

129
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:28,531
You'll get beaten up.

130
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:30,533
Okay.

131
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,002
What okay?

132
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:33,203
Have you seen how
tall her father is?

133
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:38,147
I was 100 percent sure that violins
would start playing in you heart.

134
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,578
Really? I'm proud of you.

135
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:41,778
You should be.

136
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:44,352
Even if you get her to
like you, nothing can happen.

137
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:45,514
Believe me.

138
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,294
And her father's a lawyer.

139
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:56,668
Same speed, same speed.

140
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:58,595
Come here, Valentine!

141
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,195
Dude, sisters are crazy.

142
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:02,465
I mean, they're the
little good daughters.

143
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:04,270
Okay? Never listen to them.

144
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,006
In love, listen to your heart,
not your sister.

145
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,838
What does your heart say?

146
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:11,974
"Jessie, Jessie" right?

147
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:16,043
So, now all we have to think
about is how to approach Jessie..

148
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:17,384
And how to propose to her.

149
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:18,888
That's all. Focus.

150
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:20,049
Focus okay, sir.

151
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,353
I wasn't talking to you, dude.

152
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,618
Anything else?

153
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:24,687
Another shocker.

154
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:26,363
This one will bowl you out for sure.

155
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:29,729
What? - She completed B.Sc.,
three years back.

156
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:32,128
And you finished
engineering last year.

157
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:34,531
So?

158
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,801
That's good. What's wrong?

159
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:38,077
See, this is why you'd fail in Math.

160
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:40,043
Dude, she's a year older than you.

161
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,172
What are you saying?

162
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:45,042
She doesn't look a
day older than 18.

163
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:46,478
Yeah, you wish, broth er.

164
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:47,677
A year older.

165
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,754
And a Christian. Problem 2.

166
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:51,148
She's a year older than you?

167
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:52,986
- Yes sir.
- You're lucky.

168
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:55,152
In my town in U.P.
there's a saying...

169
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:56,622
"The older the bride,
the more luck she brings."

170
00:14:57,162 --> 00:15:00,063
And I think it
applies to Maharashtra too.

171
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:01,633
U.P. & Maharashtra are the same!

172
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:04,962
All girls know the tricks of love.

173
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:08,268
But, if she's a year or two elder..

174
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,068
Then she'll show a
little more care in the love.

175
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:13,635
"Baby" sweetheart.
All the mushy stuff.

176
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:17,846
And such girls, they take care
of everything, I mean everything.

177
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,342
What Sir!?

178
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:20,680
So don't worry.

179
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,311
Not me, sir.

180
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:23,947
Jessie will worry.

181
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:25,281
That's the art my friend.

182
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:26,620
You shouldn't let Jessie worry.

183
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:27,917
Art of loving.

184
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:34,324
Who the hell is she?

185
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,525
She's mine.

186
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:47,542
Hi, I'm Jerry.

187
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:48,807
Hello problem 3.

188
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:50,006
- Sachin.
- Jessie's brother.

189
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:51,641
He spells trouble.

190
00:15:57,222 --> 00:15:58,280
Hello.

191
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:59,682
This is my house.

192
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:02,087
I know. You're Jessie's dad.

193
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:04,288
You know Jessie?

194
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,525
Yes. I mean, he's my friend.

195
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:08,355
Oh. You mean Jerry.

196
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:10,967
Oh your son's name is Jerry.

197
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,668
Okay, yeah, Jerry.

198
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:16,431
What do you do?

199
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:18,668
'An.

200
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:21,104
Mechanical engineer.

201
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:22,681
- Good.
- Very good.

202
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:24,006
Thank you, sir.

203
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:25,311
Come home someday.

204
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:29,149
It is your house, yet.. do come.

205
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:30,547
Sure.

206
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,251
Problem 4.

207
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,753
Seems quite big.

208
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:40,294
Sir, how tall are you?

209
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,591
What?

210
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:42,892
"Height?

211
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:44,794
6' 3".

212
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:47,296
Amitabh Bachchan is also the same.

213
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:48,834
Who's Amitabh Bachchan?

214
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,676
He lives right here, sir.

215
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:55,073
Oh. Neighbor.

216
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:56,605
Neighbor.

217
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:11,762
How can you live in
such a dirty room?

218
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,229
Mom, please - Okay, listen.

219
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:14,860
Your dad's upset.

220
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,966
He thinks you're wasting time.

221
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:18,701
Yes, mom.
He wants to talk to you.

222
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:20,431
Be home in the evening.
Who's come over, Mom?

223
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:22,936
Sounds just like Lata Mangeshkar.

224
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,703
Oh shut up. It's the
landlord's daughter.

225
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:26,405
Oh, from upstairs.

226
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:27,870
Stay away!

227
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,311
Mom, you know my taste.

228
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:41,083
A superb move by my sister!

229
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:42,490
She got Jessie home.

230
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:48,990
After redevelopment, it'll be
three instead of two bedrooms.

231
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:50,192
I think it'll be nice.

232
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:52,798
Hey, Jessie. This is my brother.

233
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,737
- Hello.
- Hi. I'm Sachin.

234
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:57,833
I know.

235
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:01,773
Your mom keeps
calling your name all day.

236
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,281
Sachin this.. Sachin that..

237
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,210
I can hear it upstairs.

238
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:08,311
Yeah!

239
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:12,221
So even you figured out that.

240
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:13,782
I'm jobless.

241
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,156
No. No. I didn't mean that.

242
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:19,121
I know.

243
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:21,395
How come your Hindi is so good?

244
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:25,666
In fact, it's better
than my Malayalam.

245
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:29,300
Since when are you..

246
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:31,901
In Mumbai?

247
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:34,877
Born here, brought up here.

248
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:37,339
Don't be all formal with me.

249
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:40,412
But Kerala..

250
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,646
Is such a beautiful place.

251
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:44,313
I've been there so many times.

252
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:47,924
You get good steam cakes..

253
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,685
Toddy and.. of course..

254
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:51,654
Mohanlal.

255
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:53,624
Who's Mohanlal?

256
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:59,336
The father hasn't heard of Bachchan,
and the daughter, of Mohanlal.

257
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:00,928
What can I say!

258
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:02,736
He's one of my favorite actors.

259
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:06,237
Well, there's a lot more to
Kerala than toddy and Mohanlal.

260
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:10,307
Yeah true.

261
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:12,842
I know.

262
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:20,420
Where's your house in Kerala?

263
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:22,888
Pulinkunnu. Alleppey.

264
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:25,521
I mean, my parents
are from Pulinkunnu.

265
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:28,424
Pulu..

266
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:32,666
Gosh, such tough names!

267
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:38,067
I mean.. Do you go to Kerala often?

268
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:39,838
My grandmother stays there.

269
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:42,747
I do go to meet her once a year.

270
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:45,110
She's so cute.

271
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:47,014
I really like it there.

272
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:51,453
But, how did you do B.Sc. in Math?

273
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:53,752
I mean, how could you study Math?

274
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:56,885
I like Math. It's so difficult!

275
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:58,764
"When you love something"

276
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:00,223
it becomes simple.

277
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,768
Even I like Math.

278
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:06,060
But Math doesn't seem to like me.

279
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:09,933
I know.

280
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:12,742
You're an engineer, right?

281
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:14,536
- Mechanical.
- It was pointless.

282
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,575
My brother wants to make movies.

283
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:19,479
He wants to be a film-maker.

284
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:20,977
Really?

285
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:23,479
- Yeah?
- Yes.

286
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:25,348
I mean..

287
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:26,882
Now I'm just thinking.

288
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:29,551
One day, I'll do it.

289
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:31,123
It's a little tough.

290
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:32,321
Tougher than Math.

291
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:34,229
But when you love something

292
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:36,392
it becomes simple.

293
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:42,707
You know I've watched
only five movies ever.

294
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:46,906
Really? Why?

295
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,241
Dad didn't let me.

296
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:52,041
Which ones?

297
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:54,251
- I don't remember.
- But why?

298
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:59,118
It's considered a sin amongst us.

299
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:00,291
Against religion.

300
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:03,554
I mean, my dad follows
all this very strictly.

301
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:06,823
Broth er..

302
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:08,492
Get lost.

303
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:11,059
Yes.. I'll head out.

304
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:14,732
I've to go to the bank,
to deposit a cheque.

305
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:16,068
- I'll see you..
- Bye.

306
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:17,499
Later.

307
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:19,402
What a shocker!

308
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:21,176
She should at least watch movies!

309
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:24,612
My entire world fell apart,
in a moment.

310
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,954
The 'Follow her' formula.

311
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:31,752
Never fails.

312
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:35,285
There's a McDonald's
near Jessie's office.

313
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:37,963
So she will definitely
come here sooner or later.

314
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:08,083
Hi.

315
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,618
Hi.

316
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:14,924
A chicken burger for you.

317
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,529
I'll have a veg burger.

318
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:18,931
Jessie, should I
order a burger for you?

319
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:20,470
Yeah, I'll have a chicken burger.
Okay, fine.

320
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:24,371
Are you following me?

321
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:27,303
Ah.

322
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:32,441
And you?

323
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:35,643
My office is near here. I work here.

324
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:39,750
I don't work here.

325
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:42,050
I am jobless.

326
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:44,588
Filet-O-Fish

327
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,191
my favorite.

328
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:48,396
Your order ma'am.
It's not made at home.

329
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:56,104
No..

330
00:22:56,441 --> 00:22:57,636
Thank you.

331
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:05,978
So, what do you do?

332
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:09,145
Program analyst with Syntel.

333
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:12,548
You'll have something?

334
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,824
No, thanks. I'll help myself.

335
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:16,886
Okay!

336
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:19,124
Okay, see you.

337
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,423
Yeah bye.
May I take your order?

338
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:25,127
Your order, sir.

339
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:30,068
Sir, your order please.
Let me look at her, brother.

340
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:35,806
Sir, place the order
and look all you want!

341
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:48,417
Hi.

342
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:49,785
Hi.

343
00:23:57,135 --> 00:23:58,660
- Hi.
- Hi.

344
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:00,161
Office?

345
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,507
No, cricket.

346
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:04,940
Want to play, Sachin.. Tendulkar?

347
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,100
Humour eh? Good.

348
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,172
You're hot.

349
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,443
Sorry?

350
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:12,875
It's very hot today.

351
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:15,316
Eh.. hot!

352
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:21,550
Blue really suits you.

353
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:23,051
Thank you.

354
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:25,495
Is someone coming?
Someone might.

355
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:27,996
- Who?
- My dad.

356
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:30,295
And he'll kill me if
he sees me with you.

357
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:31,960
What are you saying?

358
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,396
Really?

359
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,232
How old are you? - 22.

360
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,511
Oh okay. That's fine.

361
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:43,713
I'll say you're like my kid brother.

362
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:44,907
I'm 23.

363
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:48,854
I mean, if he does see me with you.

364
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:51,823
Look, I'm not a
brother to you all right!

365
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:54,890
Actually, you're right.

366
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:57,025
I already have a brother.

367
00:24:57,629 --> 00:24:59,154
One painful brother is enough.

368
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:00,355
No no no.

369
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:02,866
Any girl in the world can
be my sister, but not you.

370
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:06,938
Why not?
Because, I think I love you.

371
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:14,840
I'm in love with you, Jessie.

372
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:20,785
I.. I can't help it.

373
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:45,133
Man! Why did I rush it?

374
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:48,574
You won't find a bigger idiot!

375
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:50,640
Now what do I do?

376
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,475
Apologize?

377
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:53,909
But to whom?

378
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:55,645
Where is Jessie?

379
00:25:58,657 --> 00:25:59,783
Sachin!

380
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,188
Wh at?

381
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:07,258
She's gone to Kerala - What?

382
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:09,999
How do you know?

383
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:11,394
Her mother told me.

384
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:13,801
She's off to see her grandmother.
For seven days.

385
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:18,339
I've seen you circling
the house all the time.

386
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:22,238
Your neck must be sore too, no!

387
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:24,606
So save it.

388
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:27,016
She's gone to Alleppey..

389
00:26:27,017 --> 00:26:28,179
And that's not in Madras.

390
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:29,617
My sister kept blabbering..

391
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,119
And I'd already reached Kerala.

392
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:35,086
If Sunny Deol could take a
truck all the way to Pakistan..

393
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:36,755
Why couldn't I go to Kerala?

394
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:42,464
A swipe of Anay sir's credit card..

395
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,326
And we were on a flight to Kerala.

396
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,302
I'm here for my own
sake, not yours.

397
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:47,701
No cameraman can blow the
chance to come to Kerala.

398
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:52,336
Sachin, like I am
there for you today..

399
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,378
Someone was there for me once.

400
00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:59,879
Besides, it's fun to
see you in love buddy.

401
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:01,243
You look cute like this.

402
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:04,014
We've already circled
Alleppey four times!

403
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,214
Find another Jessie, please.

404
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:07,189
Call up your lovely sister.

405
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,120
Tell her to go upstairs

406
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:10,786
sweet talk Jessie's mother and..

407
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:13,455
Get her Kerala address somehow.

408
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,460
How's that possible, sir?

409
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:17,899
Kid sisters are good at such things.

410
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:19,704
Please. We'll drop dead otherwise.

411
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:21,437
I'm in my forties now..

412
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,965
My knees will give way.

413
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:33,876
I don't know why I'm saying this.

414
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:37,611
Sachin, in love, always
be a tiger, or a cheetah.

415
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:39,318
Jessie will surely be yours.

416
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,292
Anay sir.

417
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:51,494
What is it?

418
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:52,695
Sir, I had an idea.

419
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,765
What if we add a dash of
Einstein's brains to the tiger?

420
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,408
Have you lost it, Sachin?

421
00:27:58,877 --> 00:27:59,935
Sir..

422
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:01,403
Sir, I mean..

423
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:02,975
I've racked my brains.

424
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:05,415
- Today's Sunday.
- So?

425
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:07,712
Sir, Jessie's Christian.

426
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:09,378
Today is mass.

427
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:11,620
Jessie will surely
go to the church.

428
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:15,852
Sachin, there are more
churches than homes in Kerala.

429
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:19,762
I don't wake up early on Sunday
even if there's a tsunami, please.

430
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:22,663
Sir, Jessie will go to the
biggest and the best church right?

431
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:24,197
Let's go, sir.

432
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:26,168
And we can find harmony too.
Please.

433
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:29,598
Harmony.. Who is she?

434
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,880
What if she isn't here either?

435
00:28:37,982 --> 00:28:39,643
This is the most famous church

436
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:41,243
she'll definitely come.

437
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:42,911
How are you so sure?

438
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,078
Detailing, sir.

439
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:45,753
Cinema needs detailing.

440
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,824
Is that so? You'll
tell me about detailing!

441
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:03,240
- What?
- Look, sir.

442
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,344
Holy mother of God!

443
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:09,174
This is Jessie.

444
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:13,582
No, I mean she's fantastic!

445
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:16,644
How could you be so lucky?

446
00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:26,357
<i>Messages come in and messages go..</i>

447
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:27,863
Why're you singing
a song from Border?

448
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:29,832
You're here to attack or to love?

449
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:31,800
Sir, to attack, with my love.

450
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:36,098
Sir..

451
00:29:37,008 --> 00:29:39,340
She'll turn back..

452
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:42,509
- In 10 seconds.
- Oh yeah?

453
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:45,148
You're quite the psychic!

454
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:48,817
No, sir. I'm like Shahrukh Khan
from Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge.

455
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:52,784
Tick tick one..

456
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,352
Tick tick two..

457
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:01,160
Tick tick three..

458
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,265
Tick tick four.

459
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,113
Holy mother of God! -
Didn't I tell you, sir!

460
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:19,907
That's really something, you
lovesick puppy. My Shahrukh Khan.

461
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:22,420
Come on, let's get out of here.

462
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:24,680
Let's go.

463
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:27,417
- Sir, wait.
- Let's go.

464
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:32,662
Come on. Let's go.
She'll come and talk to you.

465
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,709
Anay sir, Jessie's here.

466
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:54,777
Didn't I tell you?

467
00:30:57,989 --> 00:30:59,081
What are you doing here?

468
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,716
L.. Well, I came to apologize.

469
00:31:02,093 --> 00:31:03,185
I mean..

470
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:05,124
I rushed it..

471
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:07,390
<i>'I love you'.</i>

472
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:11,228
I thought you'd be upset.

473
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:13,935
I mean, I felt bad as well.

474
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:15,730
You disappeared.

475
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:19,435
I figured you're here, so
I came too, to apologize.

476
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:22,440
I'm sorry, Jessie.

477
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:25,240
Jessie.

478
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:26,875
Okay, fine.

479
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:28,383
You're my classmate, okay?

480
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:29,812
That's what I'll say.

481
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:31,685
Please. My granny's here.

482
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:36,357
Jessie, Anay sir. Big cameraman.

483
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:37,519
Nice to meet you, sir.

484
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:39,130
Just a friend - Okay.

485
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,441
You got that eh?

486
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:55,103
No no, childhood friends.

487
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:56,905
All three of us.

488
00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:01,210
I'm Jessie's classmate.

489
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,458
Who is it, Jessie?
This is my uncle George.

490
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:08,684
Sachin, my classmate.

491
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:10,385
- Oh Hello.
- Hello.

492
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:11,586
Jessie's Uncle.

493
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:13,925
Sister, Reena.

494
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:15,363
Sachin, my classmate.

495
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:16,490
This is also an uncle.

496
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:18,124
- So many of them?
- Aunt Anjali.

497
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:19,294
My cousins.

498
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:25,734
Food, food.

499
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:27,242
Eat food, eat food.

500
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:28,471
Eat food, eat food.

501
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:32,106
What are you doing?

502
00:32:34,752 --> 00:32:35,947
- Bye.
- Childhood friend.

503
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:45,162
It's okay. Come.

504
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:47,792
You'll have to take the boat.

505
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:50,023
Ask for Kalipurackal house.

506
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,499
- Kalipurackal.
- Kalipurackal.

507
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:52,728
Kalipurackal house.

508
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:55,971
Very keen on lunch eh?

509
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:57,300
What a family, sir!

510
00:32:57,675 --> 00:33:00,110
Go over to apologize and
they invite you to lunch.

511
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:01,609
Hello.

512
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:08,375
No problem getting here?
Grammar's right?

513
00:33:11,856 --> 00:33:15,292
Hindu, from Mumbai.

514
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,055
A lot of Jessie's
friends come here. - Is it?

515
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:23,295
The last time Jessie was in Kerala
20 friends were here.

516
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:24,865
Grammar's right?

517
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:27,036
Yes, sir. '20 friends
came' is correct Hindi.

518
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,536
- Yes.
- Got it.

519
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:30,598
Heard what the midget said?

520
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:32,073
20 boys have followed her here.

521
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,769
- Friends, sir!
- Right.. right.

522
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:11,743
He's asking if
you've come here before.

523
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:15,410
One time before this.

524
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,113
I do know a little Hindi.

525
00:34:17,922 --> 00:34:21,324
- Correct?
- Yes, yes. You do.

526
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:31,935
Hmm.

527
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:35,833
So you like Mathematics as well?

528
00:34:36,974 --> 00:34:38,100
Hmmm.

529
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:39,840
- Correct?
- Yes, sir.

530
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:44,513
This is the best fish curry.

531
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,651
- Sorry?
- Job, job.

532
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,149
My job?

533
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:56,284
Cinema, sir.

534
00:34:57,562 --> 00:35:00,463
Photography? Camera? Mammooty?

535
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:02,055
Sorry sir..

536
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:03,292
No mathematics.

537
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:06,404
Even he has a problem with cinema.

538
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:07,661
He won't hit me, right?

539
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:10,871
The midget is much
stronger than he looks.

540
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:13,601
Out.. out.. sir..

541
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:15,142
Digestion.

542
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,241
After eating, walking, sir.

543
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,440
You too, sir.

544
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:26,356
You know what, this time
I'll travel alone by train.

545
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:28,283
Train travel has its own charm.

546
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:31,786
Why are you here?

547
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:32,987
I told you already.

548
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:35,097
I thought you'd be angry.

549
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:36,428
I am angry...

550
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:37,830
Let it go, Jessie.

551
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:40,604
Don't stop talking to me.

552
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:43,471
These things happen.

553
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:46,432
Don't take it too seriously.

554
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:49,510
I don't take you seriously.

555
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:51,173
But I do.

556
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,511
"Actually"

557
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:56,244
it was too fast then. I agree.

558
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:58,848
But, it's been ten days since.

559
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:01,948
Now, I'm crazy about you.

560
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:06,787
I swear Jessie, I haven't felt
like this for 22 years in Mumbai.

561
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,091
Now..

562
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:10,926
There's just you..

563
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:12,627
You and you.

564
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:17,865
I wanted to tell you this as well.

565
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:22,043
I couldn't stay away
for a second, Jessie..

566
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:23,739
Neither could Anay sir.

567
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:25,440
Without you.

568
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:30,186
Drama Queen!

569
00:36:32,456 --> 00:36:34,720
Don't.. don't waste
your time, Sachin.

570
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:36,557
It's pointless.

571
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:40,888
- Why?
- Firstly, love marriage.

572
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:42,124
And you..

573
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:44,559
You're a Hindu.

574
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:46,165
And I'm a good person.

575
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:48,230
Dad will never agree.

576
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,501
But..
And I don't want to elope.

577
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:54,106
I can't go against my dad.

578
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:59,577
And you know what? I've
lived in Mumbai for 23 years.

579
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:02,451
So I'm a year older than you.

580
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,146
Me..

581
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:05,514
Older than you.

582
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:07,488
And that too is a problem.

583
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:09,091
All that doesn't matter nowadays.

584
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:13,496
Look, I should like you too, right?

585
00:37:13,864 --> 00:37:15,195
That's important as well.

586
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:18,730
Yes, that's right.

587
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:20,898
It's very important.

588
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:24,299
All right..

589
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,438
So let's be friends first.

590
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:28,606
Let love go take a hike.

591
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:30,406
Okay? ' Okay,

592
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:34,515
We'll talk when we feel like,
meet when we feel like.

593
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:37,612
Friends?

594
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:39,353
Yes, right approach.

595
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:40,782
Let's shake on it.

596
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:50,993
You're not afraid of flying.

597
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,331
Don't try to fool me.

598
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:55,604
You both aren't even
just friends, all right!

599
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,573
Now you'll keep trying to get
her under the guise of friendship.

600
00:37:58,676 --> 00:37:59,973
It's all a sham!

601
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:03,173
Once a Romeo, always a Romeo.

602
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:05,240
- Correct, sir.
- 'Correct sir'!

603
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:07,511
Why don't you continue
your drama back in Mumbai?

604
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:09,450
I'll get bored all
alone on the flight.

605
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:12,246
Anay sir, you leave.

606
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:14,755
I need to focus, in the train.

607
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:15,950
Focus!

608
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:19,829
How did you even dare to touch me?

609
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:23,161
Dare to hold my hand?

610
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:27,064
On the train.

611
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:29,370
You said we're just friends.

612
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,365
Is this how friends behave?

613
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:34,372
After that I kissed you also.

614
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:36,644
On the train, Jessie.

615
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:40,282
And you didn't stop me.
We are so good..

616
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:42,044
Oh, I didn't stop you.

617
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:43,210
That's why it happened?

618
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,788
I'm sorry, Sachin. It's my fault.

619
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:45,980
That's not what I meant.

620
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:47,557
I shouldn't have even
talked to you on the train.

621
00:43:47,658 --> 00:43:48,921
Please sit, Jessie.

622
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,623
Please Jessie.

623
00:43:57,668 --> 00:43:59,363
"Yes, I said we're friends"

624
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,460
will always be.

625
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:04,006
But, I saw you on the train
and forgot all of it Jessie.

626
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:06,173
It was just love.

627
00:44:12,616 --> 00:44:14,277
Right now, you're
sitting there, and I'm here.

628
00:44:15,252 --> 00:44:18,688
But I feel like I should be there,
with you, next to you.

629
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:22,988
Jessie we have this
amazing chemistry.

630
00:44:25,195 --> 00:44:26,594
Can't you feel it?

631
00:44:27,898 --> 00:44:29,866
Look, this is.. this is love Jessie.

632
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:31,426
That's it.

633
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:32,899
I'm crazy about you..

634
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:34,395
I am mad about you.

635
00:44:36,573 --> 00:44:38,166
We need to talk, stay here.

636
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:52,453
There's no love, no chemistry.

637
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:55,384
Yes, we did kiss.

638
00:44:55,826 --> 00:44:56,987
I don't know why.

639
00:44:57,594 --> 00:45:00,325
You are sitting across the table..

640
00:45:00,664 --> 00:45:02,462
Not with me, not next to me.

641
00:45:02,566 --> 00:45:05,263
I'm just plain angry, that's all.

642
00:45:07,304 --> 00:45:10,330
Sachin.. my sister did
the exact same thing.

643
00:45:11,008 --> 00:45:15,275
Even then, there were
only tears and fights.

644
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:19,205
My dad made me swear I
wouldn't do something like that.

645
00:45:19,316 --> 00:45:21,114
Do you like me or not, Jessie?

646
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,345
That's all I need to know.

647
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:27,217
You handle the love..

648
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:29,720
I'll handle everything else.

649
00:45:33,997 --> 00:45:35,795
Sachin, I like you.

650
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:39,663
But I don't want all these problems.

651
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:41,296
It's simple.

652
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:42,770
Do you get it?

653
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:45,900
Bye.

654
00:45:46,276 --> 00:45:47,368
Wh at?

655
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:49,136
Don't go.

656
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:50,937
Jessie.

657
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:10,332
The budget for the party
has been reduced to half.

658
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:12,235
I was this close to victory.

659
00:46:12,736 --> 00:46:15,671
Otherwise we'd be sipping Scotch at
the Marriott, not here in Woodcan.

660
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:16,965
Hmm.

661
00:46:17,574 --> 00:46:20,669
So she's said 'I lo'
but not 'we you'.

662
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:24,013
Sir, you're a genius!

663
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,707
How does that matter?

664
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:27,849
I missed the fine scotch.

665
00:46:30,487 --> 00:46:31,579
That's what.

666
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:34,123
She likes me but won't fall in love.

667
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:35,884
Correct.

668
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:37,549
I'm such an idiotic Romeo

669
00:46:37,928 --> 00:46:41,865
who had to find this Juliet
among all the women in Mumbai!

670
00:46:44,168 --> 00:46:46,364
Of all the girls in the world,
why did I fall in love with Jessie?

671
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:49,737
These beautiful girls..

672
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,330
Screw with men's heads.

673
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:53,334
Tell me..

674
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:55,604
Is she worth it?

675
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,243
I can give up my life for her, sir.

676
00:46:58,348 --> 00:47:00,282
That's that then. Love is great!

677
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:02,408
Cheers to that. Get him a Coke.

678
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:05,682
Here I am down in the dumps..

679
00:47:05,856 --> 00:47:08,348
And there she is,
fresh as a dew drop

680
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:09,857
in the middle of the day!

681
00:47:10,627 --> 00:47:12,254
Isn't she just a
little too beautiful?

682
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:13,824
I wonder why she's called me here.

683
00:47:13,964 --> 00:47:15,489
What is it going to be now?

684
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,395
Hi Sachin.

685
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:19,761
Hi.

686
00:47:21,438 --> 00:47:22,530
Shall we go?

687
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:25,166
Are you sure?

688
00:47:26,076 --> 00:47:27,737
You want to watch a movie?

689
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:30,074
We can watch it till the interval.

690
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,972
Then we can go someplace and talk.

691
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:34,876
Wh at?

692
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:36,446
Up to the interval?

693
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:44,024
Life's become so boring, Sachin.

694
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:48,028
To work and home, everyday.

695
00:47:49,499 --> 00:47:52,434
And today, I wanted to meet you.

696
00:47:54,438 --> 00:47:55,496
Really?

697
00:47:56,673 --> 00:47:57,799
Yeah.

698
00:47:58,075 --> 00:48:01,067
I told my dad that I
have to work late today.

699
00:48:01,845 --> 00:48:02,971
Overtime.

700
00:48:08,085 --> 00:48:09,484
Are you watching the movie?

701
00:48:11,455 --> 00:48:12,547
Is it any good?

702
00:48:13,457 --> 00:48:14,856
Or can we talk?

703
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:16,584
It's good..

704
00:48:17,527 --> 00:48:18,858
But we can talk as well.

705
00:48:22,299 --> 00:48:24,290
Sachin, can we be in
this without love?

706
00:48:24,468 --> 00:48:26,300
We should just stay friends.

707
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,970
Forget about the movie, let's go.

708
00:48:34,678 --> 00:48:35,975
You know, Sachin..

709
00:48:36,947 --> 00:48:38,039
You..

710
00:48:39,016 --> 00:48:40,211
I mean..

711
00:48:42,886 --> 00:48:44,980
You were my first kiss.

712
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:49,416
I've never even
been on a date before.

713
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:53,051
Drop me off here.

714
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:07,736
Jessie, wait.

715
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,977
You're saying there's
nothing going on here?

716
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:15,980
Let's be in this without love?

717
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,016
How?

718
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:21,350
On one hand you tell me
I was your first kiss..

719
00:49:21,858 --> 00:49:23,326
And then you say we're just friends!

720
00:49:25,062 --> 00:49:26,723
You sit four inches
away on the bike..

721
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:31,267
To avoid even a touch, right'?

722
00:49:37,341 --> 00:49:39,901
Jessie, I want to make
love to you all the time.

723
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:44,577
Sachin, don't talk like that. Okay?

724
00:49:44,715 --> 00:49:46,149
- What's wrong?
- What do I do?

725
00:49:48,251 --> 00:49:49,685
Call myself a friend?

726
00:49:50,787 --> 00:49:53,051
Or live the truth you refuse to see?

727
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,286
Jessie, we choose friends.

728
00:49:57,894 --> 00:49:59,384
But Love chooses us.

729
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:02,724
And this Love didn't
give me any choice.

730
00:50:03,433 --> 00:50:06,926
In one second I could only
fall in love. Nothing else.

731
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:11,837
You're scared of your dad..

732
00:50:12,409 --> 00:50:14,138
Yet you want to see me.

733
00:50:14,745 --> 00:50:15,871
"Ism?."

734
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:19,677
What about us seems like
friendship, Jessie? Nothing!

735
00:50:19,816 --> 00:50:24,913
Tell your dad that Sachin,
from downstairs, loves me.

736
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:26,490
He'll keep me happy...

737
00:50:27,257 --> 00:50:29,885
He's more than a good friend
He's my world.

738
00:50:30,327 --> 00:50:32,386
He could give up his life for me.

739
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:35,464
And that's why I want to
spend my life with him.

740
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:40,559
Please Jessie. Beg, plead,
cry, stop eating for awhile.

741
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:42,361
Your dad will come around.

742
00:50:43,407 --> 00:50:45,034
Anyway, your dad has changed.

743
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:48,605
He will come around.

744
00:50:51,815 --> 00:50:53,943
Such a tall, hefty man..
He must have some sense.

745
00:50:57,087 --> 00:50:58,521
Even she's a big problem.

746
00:50:58,822 --> 00:50:59,914
How did I forget?

747
00:51:04,428 --> 00:51:07,329
I've seen her back
more than her front.

748
00:51:08,532 --> 00:51:10,057
Not that I was complaining.

749
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,634
Such a beautiful problem.

750
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:14,598
Problem 5.

751
00:54:51,021 --> 00:54:52,113
Jessie..

752
00:54:52,856 --> 00:54:54,722
I don't want to talk to you, Sachin.

753
00:54:55,392 --> 00:54:57,986
I've been serenading you
for a whole month now.

754
00:54:58,295 --> 00:54:59,387
At least talk to me

755
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:02,293
Jerry saw you outside my office.

756
00:55:02,499 --> 00:55:04,263
It will become a problem.
I'm telling you.

757
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:06,500
I swear, I will not
do anything to Jerry.

758
00:55:07,504 --> 00:55:08,596
Just talk to me..

759
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:11,064
No.. Please go.. please.

760
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:23,509
Sachin.. why are you here?

761
00:55:24,688 --> 00:55:25,746
I didn't come to meet you.

762
00:55:25,855 --> 00:55:27,949
I'm here for the breeze..

763
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:29,150
On the terrace.

764
00:55:29,626 --> 00:55:30,684
I come every day.

765
00:55:30,794 --> 00:55:32,489
Where can you find
a terrace in Juhu?

766
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:35,459
Bungalow, terrace.

767
00:55:37,767 --> 00:55:39,462
Jess.. Jessie.

768
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:41,459
Sorry.

769
00:55:47,777 --> 00:55:49,575
H.. hello..

770
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:52,812
Tell me. Yes. No. Yes.

771
00:55:53,283 --> 00:55:54,717
- Oh God!
- No..

772
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:56,786
"I'm just enjoying the breeze"

773
00:55:56,953 --> 00:55:58,011
on the terrace.

774
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:00,881
No, no. Yes, I ate.

775
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:02,048
What happened,
Jessie? What happened?

776
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:03,751
Nothing. Nothing, Jerry.

777
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,225
No. I just came to get the clothes.

778
00:56:06,396 --> 00:56:07,886
It might rain.

779
00:56:08,164 --> 00:56:09,996
No, not alone. Jerry's here.

780
00:56:10,133 --> 00:56:11,225
Hey!

781
00:56:12,502 --> 00:56:13,628
Okay. I'll call you later.

782
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:18,171
Weren't you outside the
office today.. with Jessie?

783
00:56:18,575 --> 00:56:19,701
No.

784
00:56:20,744 --> 00:56:22,735
Even now you aren't
on the terrace, right?

785
00:56:23,847 --> 00:56:26,248
I came to get the clothes.

786
00:56:26,649 --> 00:56:27,844
It could rain.

787
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:30,679
I'm not an idiot, you...

788
00:56:31,421 --> 00:56:32,820
I don't get angry often.

789
00:56:33,356 --> 00:56:34,949
And Jerry's my brother-in-law.

790
00:56:35,325 --> 00:56:37,123
But he shouldn't have said that.

791
00:56:37,861 --> 00:56:40,159
I wanted to forgive him..

792
00:56:41,464 --> 00:56:42,522
But couldn't.

793
00:56:42,832 --> 00:56:44,027
One punch, at least!

794
00:56:44,434 --> 00:56:46,061
Anyway, Jessie's the one I love..

795
00:56:46,336 --> 00:56:47,394
Not Jerry.

796
00:56:49,873 --> 00:56:50,931
Shit.

797
00:56:51,141 --> 00:56:52,575
Jerry, wait. I'll kill you!

798
00:56:52,675 --> 00:56:53,767
Listen to me.

799
00:56:53,877 --> 00:56:55,242
Jerry sorry, let's talk first.

800
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:56,704
Jerry..

801
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:59,143
You shouldn't have abused me.

802
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,414
We pay rent on time.

803
00:57:01,618 --> 00:57:03,985
What are you both doing?
Oh my God! Stop, Jerry.

804
00:57:04,287 --> 00:57:05,482
Why're you guys fighting?

805
00:57:06,856 --> 00:57:07,948
He started it.

806
00:57:08,558 --> 00:57:10,253
I don't know why.
Such a kid! Stop it!

807
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:11,486
Bad words..

808
00:57:14,697 --> 00:57:16,392
Okay, Jerry.

809
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,192
Sorry, Jerry.

810
00:57:18,802 --> 00:57:20,566
Jessie, I'm sorry. I'm leaving.

811
00:57:21,905 --> 00:57:23,373
I won't spare you..

812
00:57:23,706 --> 00:57:24,901
I'm telling you.

813
00:57:25,909 --> 00:57:27,172
The signal was weak.

814
00:57:42,592 --> 00:57:43,753
Give me a minute.

815
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:09,441
What's up Jerry?
Anything I can do for you?

816
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:10,814
Get into the car.

817
00:58:11,354 --> 00:58:13,846
If we beat you up here,
you'll lose face.

818
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:16,716
Otherwise there's another option.

819
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,719
Lick my shoe, it's branded.

820
00:58:19,863 --> 00:58:21,661
Apologize. Then get lost.

821
00:58:21,865 --> 00:58:23,492
Not too much to ask?

822
00:58:23,967 --> 00:58:25,059
What do you say?

823
00:58:25,368 --> 00:58:28,235
Come on, Jerry. Let's
save time and whack him.

824
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:29,965
His face calls for action.

825
00:58:30,073 --> 00:58:31,404
Hell, hang on!

826
00:58:32,542 --> 00:58:33,873
Jerry, I'm sorry about yesterday.

827
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:35,876
I shouldn't have hit you.

828
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:38,113
Didn't you feel bad
when I broke your nose?

829
00:58:38,748 --> 00:58:40,944
I felt bad too, when you abused me.

830
00:58:43,052 --> 00:58:45,077
There's nothing
between Jessie and me.

831
00:58:45,922 --> 00:58:47,253
And no, no one's calling for action.

832
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:48,824
This isn't an action movie.

833
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:52,962
And neither is it a
love story, I think.

834
00:58:54,097 --> 00:58:56,031
So I'll head out.

835
00:58:56,332 --> 00:58:57,493
I'm batting.

836
00:58:57,867 --> 00:58:59,767
You guys enjoy.

837
00:59:00,837 --> 00:59:01,998
Jerry..

838
00:59:03,072 --> 00:59:04,437
Sorry once again, brother.

839
00:59:06,476 --> 00:59:08,740
Want to make speeches eh?

840
00:59:08,845 --> 00:59:10,506
Where are you off to?
What's the rush?

841
00:59:12,482 --> 00:59:13,745
Mr. Kulkarni.

842
00:59:15,318 --> 00:59:16,547
You come out here please.

843
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:19,253
Please come out. Ask him
what he did to my daughter.

844
00:59:19,355 --> 00:59:21,687
If my son would've done
this to your daughter..

845
00:59:21,824 --> 00:59:23,155
Would he have let it go?

846
00:59:23,426 --> 00:59:24,552
He would've spoken with you.

847
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:26,362
Not called goons.

848
00:59:26,462 --> 00:59:28,021
And if at all he'd fight,
he'd fight alone.

849
00:59:28,131 --> 00:59:29,860
Now he's a trained boxer.
What can I say?

850
00:59:30,433 --> 00:59:31,901
And you called goons.

851
00:59:32,001 --> 00:59:33,435
I should call the police.

852
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:36,296
- You'll call the police?
- Yes.

853
00:59:40,209 --> 00:59:42,439
Your son's a ruffian, not mine.
What're you saying?

854
00:59:42,545 --> 00:59:44,377
What do you think? -
Tell dad to keep quiet.

855
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,175
- He's jobless?
- Yes. He is.

856
00:59:46,316 --> 00:59:48,785
He just loafs around all day!

857
00:59:48,885 --> 00:59:49,977
Keep quiet.

858
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:51,576
He's an assistant director..

859
00:59:52,355 --> 00:59:53,880
With the director of Sholay.

860
00:59:54,123 --> 00:59:55,955
He works in cinema? He's an idiot.

861
00:59:56,059 --> 00:59:57,356
Tell him to never
speak to Jessie again.

862
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,991
Go ask your girl why she
hangs around here all day!

863
01:00:01,864 --> 01:00:03,229
Jessie must have done something.

864
01:00:03,366 --> 01:00:05,596
Sachin doesn't come upstairs.

865
01:00:05,802 --> 01:00:07,327
She comes here.

866
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:09,461
Your son is an eve teaser.

867
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:11,300
I'll have him arrested. You'll see.

868
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:17,004
This is my house. - I'm sorry, Uncle.
And this is my daughter. Ok?

869
01:00:20,049 --> 01:00:21,312
Vacate, right now.

870
01:00:21,417 --> 01:00:23,146
We won't. We won't vacate.

871
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:24,515
Go talk to the builder.

872
01:00:24,654 --> 01:00:25,712
Why should I talk to
the builder? - Dad, please.

873
01:00:25,855 --> 01:00:27,254
I've paid six months advance
rent! - Dad, just forget it!

874
01:00:27,357 --> 01:00:28,483
It's not a joke!

875
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:30,059
I have a receipt to prove it!

876
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:31,684
To hell with the receipt!

877
01:00:31,828 --> 01:00:34,058
We'll see!
I'll go to the consumer court.

878
01:00:34,163 --> 01:00:35,255
The idiot! The rubbish he talks.

879
01:00:35,398 --> 01:00:37,230
He has to serve a
three-month notice first.

880
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:38,732
We won't vacate just like that.

881
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:45,638
Are you in love with Jessie?

882
01:00:47,677 --> 01:00:49,771
Yes. Yes.

883
01:00:50,513 --> 01:00:51,605
And what about her?

884
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:55,083
She will.. I mean, it
takes time for such things.

885
01:00:55,218 --> 01:00:57,152
You break her brother's nose
and she will still love you?

886
01:00:57,253 --> 01:00:58,652
But his nose will get better.

887
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:00,414
I hope.

888
01:01:01,691 --> 01:01:03,250
I will be a film-maker.

889
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,524
Jessie will fall in love with me

890
01:01:06,763 --> 01:01:09,198
ls there any normal
hope in your life?

891
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:13,262
Who breaks his
girlfriend's brother's nose?

892
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:16,833
You should've told me you love her..

893
01:01:17,073 --> 01:01:19,269
I would've controlled my anger.

894
01:01:20,877 --> 01:01:22,106
Dad!

895
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:24,575
Now, all the best.

896
01:01:25,048 --> 01:01:26,140
What else?

897
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:33,956
Jessie.. What?

898
01:01:34,057 --> 01:01:36,355
You called me,
right? Now you're leaving?

899
01:01:36,459 --> 01:01:38,018
I thought ifs all over..

900
01:01:38,161 --> 01:01:40,858
She said don't think.
It 'is' all over!

901
01:01:40,963 --> 01:01:42,522
This is how you show your love..

902
01:01:43,299 --> 01:01:44,994
By hitting my brother?

903
01:01:46,769 --> 01:01:48,737
I love you and you know that..
Okay..

904
01:01:49,572 --> 01:01:50,835
I'm getting married.

905
01:01:52,275 --> 01:01:53,970
End all of this now, Sachin.

906
01:01:57,980 --> 01:01:59,072
What.. married?

907
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:02,275
Because of all this?

908
01:02:03,186 --> 01:02:04,779
They've been
thinking for sometime now.

909
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:07,451
But now, it's final.

910
01:02:12,695 --> 01:02:15,460
I gave us a serious thought as well.

911
01:02:16,132 --> 01:02:17,725
That I'll try and convince them.

912
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:23,470
But after all this..

913
01:02:24,774 --> 01:02:26,173
It's impossible now.

914
01:02:27,977 --> 01:02:29,103
Sachin..

915
01:02:29,512 --> 01:02:31,446
Next month, the 23rd..

916
01:02:33,683 --> 01:02:35,014
Is my wedding

917
01:02:36,152 --> 01:02:37,449
at the same church.

918
01:02:41,023 --> 01:02:42,957
You tell me, Sachin. What do I do?

919
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:44,719
Go.

920
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:47,961
Go, get married, Jessie.

921
01:02:48,197 --> 01:02:49,289
What else?

922
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:52,229
You haven't come here
to ask for permission!

923
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:56,364
You're just informing me. Right?

924
01:02:56,973 --> 01:02:58,270
So you've told me.

925
01:03:00,042 --> 01:03:01,134
Why're you still here?

926
01:03:02,245 --> 01:03:03,542
Go!

927
01:03:23,699 --> 01:03:24,894
Let me call you back.

928
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:30,868
I saw them leave for Kerala,
for Jessie's wedding.

929
01:03:30,973 --> 01:03:33,374
Obviously we weren't invited.

930
01:03:33,943 --> 01:03:37,243
I shouldn't have hit Jerry. Sheesh!

931
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:40,283
I turned out to be
the biggest problem.

932
01:03:42,218 --> 01:03:43,811
No. This isn't right.

933
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:45,783
Listen, Sachin..

934
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:48,783
Remember the people with
the colorful sarongs..

935
01:03:49,425 --> 01:03:53,658
There's a bright chance they'll
color our faces black and blue.

936
01:03:54,597 --> 01:03:56,190
So let's ignore it.

937
01:03:59,435 --> 01:04:00,732
Sir. I've got to go.

938
01:04:03,072 --> 01:04:05,097
Give me one reason why
you want to go, Sachin.

939
01:04:05,241 --> 01:04:07,335
Sir, you know the reason.

940
01:04:07,777 --> 01:04:10,041
I want to see her one last time.

941
01:04:11,247 --> 01:04:13,079
Sir, please. For the
sake of your own Jessie.

942
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:21,551
Jessie's wedding.

943
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:23,125
Such a grand ceremony!

944
01:04:23,226 --> 01:04:25,320
What am I doing here, sir?

945
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:26,962
Look, let's not stand here.

946
01:04:27,096 --> 01:04:28,860
Let's leave, or go inside.

947
01:04:28,998 --> 01:04:30,295
You should've thought this through.

948
01:04:32,001 --> 01:04:33,162
Sheesh. He's seen us.

949
01:04:33,269 --> 01:04:35,328
- Sir, Jessie's uncle.
- Hello.

950
01:04:37,173 --> 01:04:38,231
Come come.

951
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:42,571
- Hello.
- Why're you outside?

952
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:43,941
No. We were just waiting.

953
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:48,442
Com e, please come.

954
01:04:57,093 --> 01:04:57,651
Food?

955
01:04:58,027 --> 01:04:59,688
- Yes thanks.
- Okay.

956
01:05:00,296 --> 01:05:03,960
Take punches, take kicks,
take the slaps, take a beating..

957
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:05,734
We'll take it all!

958
01:05:05,868 --> 01:05:07,859
Sir, what're you saying?
The truth, buddy.

959
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:09,233
One only speaks the
truth in a church.

960
01:05:09,372 --> 01:05:11,136
Get down.

961
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:16,845
Oh fish! Jerry, Jessie's brother.

962
01:05:17,647 --> 01:05:18,739
Don't look back.

963
01:05:18,848 --> 01:05:20,839
I'm behind the camera anyway.

964
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:22,381
You don't look back.

965
01:05:37,366 --> 01:05:40,666
Why is all this
happening to you, Sachin?

966
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:42,905
I feel so bad.

967
01:05:49,512 --> 01:05:54,916
Of all the girls in the world,
why did I fall in love with Jessie?

968
01:05:55,418 --> 01:05:59,582
Even my great
granddad cannot answer that.

969
01:06:05,261 --> 01:06:06,592
Jessie's here, sir.

970
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:12,267
Should I talk to Jessie, sir?

971
01:06:12,401 --> 01:06:13,891
No! Not here. Shut up!

972
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:25,910
Tell me when you
want to leave, okay?

973
01:06:26,282 --> 01:06:27,613
Let's watch till then.

974
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:40,191
Come on, buddy. Let's pray.

975
01:06:40,429 --> 01:06:41,590
Get up.

976
01:06:59,482 --> 01:07:00,847
Sir, she seems happy.

977
01:07:02,451 --> 01:07:03,646
Let's go.

978
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:08,582
I told you this would
be emotionally damaging.

979
01:07:09,725 --> 01:07:11,056
Now let's leave after a few minutes,

980
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:12,992
or there'll be
physical dam age as well.

981
01:07:20,669 --> 01:07:23,764
Sir, won't the priest
ask if she's willing?

982
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:25,298
"Ism?."

983
01:07:25,441 --> 01:07:27,034
He'll ask Jessie first, right?

984
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:30,175
In the movies, they
ask the boy first.

985
01:07:31,947 --> 01:07:33,005
Sir..

986
01:07:33,315 --> 01:07:34,908
Now what Sachin?

987
01:07:35,017 --> 01:07:36,678
Sir, after asking them,
they'll ask us too, right?

988
01:07:36,786 --> 01:07:38,015
Should I object, sir

989
01:07:38,454 --> 01:07:39,751
I've seen that happen in movies.

990
01:07:39,855 --> 01:07:41,186
Sir, can I object?

991
01:07:42,625 --> 01:07:43,888
Sachin, shut up.

992
01:07:44,026 --> 01:07:47,052
Such drama happens only in
the courtrooms of Hindi movies.

993
01:07:47,363 --> 01:07:49,331
We'll be dead meat,
please don't do that.

994
01:07:59,942 --> 01:08:04,209
Of all the girls in the world,
why did I fall in love with Jessie?

995
01:08:25,468 --> 01:08:27,266
Jessie, what are you talking about?

996
01:08:28,871 --> 01:08:30,168
No Jessie.

997
01:08:30,406 --> 01:08:31,999
Father, I'm sorry.

998
01:08:35,644 --> 01:08:37,772
Excuse me.. Excuse me..

999
01:08:38,047 --> 01:08:39,347
What happened?

1000
01:08:40,182 --> 01:08:41,411
Did you hear that?

1001
01:08:42,251 --> 01:08:43,412
Jessie said, 'No'.

1002
01:08:43,552 --> 01:08:45,884
What did you do buddy?

1003
01:08:46,522 --> 01:08:47,614
She said, 'No'!

1004
01:08:47,723 --> 01:08:48,884
What? What did she say?

1005
01:08:48,991 --> 01:08:51,289
Quite some love
connection you've got!

1006
01:08:52,428 --> 01:08:54,089
Roy, I'll take care of it.

1007
01:08:54,230 --> 01:08:55,698
Dad, I'm sorry. Please.

1008
01:08:55,865 --> 01:08:56,923
What's happening?

1009
01:08:57,466 --> 01:09:00,629
I've given it a lot of thought
and I don't know what else to do.

1010
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:04,197
I'm sorry, I can't go
through with this right now.

1011
01:09:05,508 --> 01:09:06,907
Roy, I'm sorry. I'll talk to her.

1012
01:09:08,077 --> 01:09:09,203
Jessie!

1013
01:09:16,252 --> 01:09:17,720
Sir, she has seen us.

1014
01:09:18,187 --> 01:09:19,313
I know.

1015
01:09:21,757 --> 01:09:22,815
If she says even a word to us,

1016
01:09:22,925 --> 01:09:26,088
we'll be in our graves
within five minutes.

1017
01:09:26,362 --> 01:09:27,591
No problem, sir.

1018
01:09:27,696 --> 01:09:29,460
But I have a problem.

1019
01:09:43,746 --> 01:09:46,078
There was only one
thought in my mind..

1020
01:09:47,149 --> 01:09:48,548
What a girl!

1021
01:09:49,652 --> 01:09:51,586
I could give up my life for her.

1022
01:10:08,337 --> 01:10:09,566
We are shocked ourselves!

1023
01:10:09,672 --> 01:10:11,106
Dude, there's quite a ruckus here!

1024
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:12,332
What should we do?

1025
01:10:12,441 --> 01:10:14,409
Let's get away
quickly or we'll be killed!

1026
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:16,342
Come on.

1027
01:10:16,478 --> 01:10:18,537
Anyway lunch has been cancelled.

1028
01:10:20,649 --> 01:10:21,775
Sir, saw what happened!

1029
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:23,409
This is why I wanted
to come to Kerala.

1030
01:10:23,519 --> 01:10:25,180
Even God cares about my emotions!

1031
01:10:25,287 --> 01:10:26,914
Of course. He does.

1032
01:10:27,022 --> 01:10:28,456
I can't get her out of my mind.

1033
01:10:28,757 --> 01:10:31,249
Did you see how happy
she was, when she saw me?

1034
01:10:32,194 --> 01:10:34,492
Like she found who
she'd been looking for!

1035
01:10:35,831 --> 01:10:37,321
She's one of a kind, sir!

1036
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,796
She's one of a kind, sir!

1037
01:10:39,935 --> 01:10:43,337
Be grateful Jessie
didn't speak to us there.

1038
01:10:43,472 --> 01:10:46,669
Or we'd be beaten so badly we
wouldn't recognize each other.

1039
01:10:46,809 --> 01:10:48,777
Really, she is one of a kind!

1040
01:10:48,877 --> 01:10:50,345
Sir, what do I do now?

1041
01:10:51,013 --> 01:10:52,947
Out here, or in life..
Nothing makes sense anymore.

1042
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:56,211
Oh, so my little philosopher
is at the emotional crossroads..

1043
01:10:56,318 --> 01:10:58,013
At such a time some vehicle
will come and take you..

1044
01:10:58,120 --> 01:10:59,144
To your destination.

1045
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:00,882
Don't you worry! Here
it comes already, see.

1046
01:11:01,023 --> 01:11:03,515
Hop on, buddy.

1047
01:11:03,626 --> 01:11:05,594
Your life is about to change.

1048
01:11:05,694 --> 01:11:07,662
This is your ticket to paradise.

1049
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:16,435
Ticket.. ticket.

1050
01:11:16,538 --> 01:11:19,371
It's funny how all the
churches here look the same.

1051
01:11:19,475 --> 01:11:21,102
The same..

1052
01:11:21,577 --> 01:11:22,976
The same..

1053
01:11:23,545 --> 01:11:26,242
No sir, this is the same church!
The very same.

1054
01:11:26,382 --> 01:11:27,474
Wh at?

1055
01:11:27,916 --> 01:11:29,213
Where the devil is this bus going!

1056
01:11:29,318 --> 01:11:30,649
Holy mother of God!

1057
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:33,414
Her brother's seen us.

1058
01:11:33,522 --> 01:11:34,614
We're dead, sir.

1059
01:11:46,368 --> 01:11:47,426
They are chasing us.

1060
01:11:47,569 --> 01:11:49,128
They wouldn't have seen us.

1061
01:11:49,238 --> 01:11:50,899
Duck down!

1062
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:54,174
Hop on to the bus.

1063
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:55,838
Ticket to your destination.

1064
01:11:55,944 --> 01:11:56,968
You'll have us killed!

1065
01:11:57,079 --> 01:11:59,241
How was I to know this
is your destination?

1066
01:12:00,082 --> 01:12:02,210
Now they'll assume Jessie
and I had planned to elope.

1067
01:12:02,584 --> 01:12:04,211
They'll go mad with anger.

1068
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:05,549
It's a huge mess!

1069
01:12:05,854 --> 01:12:07,379
And Jessieis clueless.

1070
01:12:07,489 --> 01:12:08,684
What do we do now?

1071
01:12:08,824 --> 01:12:09,916
I'm such a well-known cameraman.

1072
01:12:10,059 --> 01:12:12,187
We'll say we were here
to check out a location.

1073
01:12:16,465 --> 01:12:18,126
They'll beat us to pulp, sir.

1074
01:12:22,871 --> 01:12:23,929
He stopped the bus!

1075
01:12:24,039 --> 01:12:26,804
Now nothing can save
us from a beating!

1076
01:12:29,645 --> 01:12:30,806
What the hell are you doing here?

1077
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,210
He was in the church as well.

1078
01:12:39,521 --> 01:12:40,750
Classmate?

1079
01:12:40,989 --> 01:12:42,115
Get off the bus!

1080
01:12:42,691 --> 01:12:43,852
Get off now!

1081
01:12:43,959 --> 01:12:45,051
I won't get off. What will you do?

1082
01:12:50,332 --> 01:12:52,323
Just a minute.

1083
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:55,693
Get off now.

1084
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:00,235
Come Sachin we will have to talk.

1085
01:13:00,676 --> 01:13:01,802
Matters will get worse..

1086
01:13:02,244 --> 01:13:03,973
Please listen to me.

1087
01:13:04,179 --> 01:13:05,237
We were here to scout locations.

1088
01:13:05,347 --> 01:13:07,816
For this new movie,
'Romance by Chance'.

1089
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:09,645
I'm a very big cameraman.

1090
01:13:39,882 --> 01:13:43,250
Of all the girls in the world, why
did you fall in love with Jessie?

1091
01:13:44,653 --> 01:13:47,054
That really is a
million dollar question!

1092
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:53,561
Sir, I also want the answer to that.

1093
01:13:54,863 --> 01:13:56,422
Remember all your bravado..

1094
01:13:57,099 --> 01:13:58,863
'I'll give up my life for Jessie'..

1095
01:13:59,735 --> 01:14:00,725
The right time has come.

1096
01:14:01,537 --> 01:14:02,766
Go ahead, give up your life.

1097
01:14:04,206 --> 01:14:06,197
Don't worry, sir.

1098
01:14:06,909 --> 01:14:08,877
We all die someday.

1099
01:14:10,312 --> 01:14:13,612
Dying for Jessie will
be a worthy death, sir.

1100
01:14:14,016 --> 01:14:15,279
I don't mind.

1101
01:14:15,384 --> 01:14:16,613
'I don't mind'!

1102
01:14:17,319 --> 01:14:18,582
Why should I die, huh?

1103
01:14:18,687 --> 01:14:20,177
How's it a worthy death for me?

1104
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:22,687
It's okay, sir.

1105
01:14:23,959 --> 01:14:25,393
I'm such a popular cameraman..

1106
01:14:25,694 --> 01:14:27,184
And look how I've been disgraced.

1107
01:14:28,096 --> 01:14:32,124
I've seen an original police
station for the first time ever!

1108
01:14:32,734 --> 01:14:34,964
I'm doing Hamesh Sippy's movie.

1109
01:14:35,771 --> 01:14:37,136
He'll kick me out.

1110
01:14:37,239 --> 01:14:38,934
What will my family think?

1111
01:14:39,041 --> 01:14:40,202
- What?
- Sir..

1112
01:14:40,342 --> 01:14:41,366
Wh at?

1113
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:44,138
Sir, she called the wedding off!

1114
01:14:44,246 --> 01:14:46,715
Sachin, you're such a selfish jerk!

1115
01:14:54,022 --> 01:14:55,490
Why did you come, Sachin?

1116
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:58,058
Did you come to the church for me?

1117
01:15:11,206 --> 01:15:13,174
You all can do whatever you want!
I don't care.

1118
01:15:13,308 --> 01:15:14,366
Look at her.

1119
01:15:14,476 --> 01:15:15,671
She did the same thing.

1120
01:15:15,777 --> 01:15:17,370
It is running in the family.

1121
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:19,575
Everyone wants to
elope and get married?

1122
01:15:21,717 --> 01:15:23,583
Dad! He has followed her here too.
Who?

1123
01:15:23,986 --> 01:15:25,351
Sachin and his friend.

1124
01:15:25,454 --> 01:15:27,115
Wh at?

1125
01:15:27,222 --> 01:15:28,348
Yes, Dad.

1126
01:15:29,224 --> 01:15:30,692
He has come here before..

1127
01:15:30,826 --> 01:15:31,952
Claiming to be her classmate.

1128
01:15:32,094 --> 01:15:33,186
They had food as well.

1129
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:39,729
Did you hear that?

1130
01:15:39,835 --> 01:15:41,098
What nonsense is this!

1131
01:15:42,871 --> 01:15:44,168
What police station now?

1132
01:15:44,273 --> 01:15:46,708
I have booked them for hitting Roy.

1133
01:15:48,343 --> 01:15:50,072
Maybe they had a plan to elope.

1134
01:15:53,248 --> 01:15:54,409
J err'!!...

1135
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:03,256
Jerry, do you even know me?

1136
01:16:03,926 --> 01:16:06,793
If I wanted to elope, I
would've done it a long time ago.

1137
01:16:07,429 --> 01:16:09,363
Dad, I didn't know
that Sachin was there.

1138
01:16:09,698 --> 01:16:12,065
That's not the reason I
called the wedding off.

1139
01:16:12,167 --> 01:16:14,568
I only saw him at the
church when I was walking out.

1140
01:16:15,304 --> 01:16:16,863
I didn't even know he was there.

1141
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:19,306
I promise you dad, believe me.

1142
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:21,740
What's Sachin done, Mom?

1143
01:16:21,877 --> 01:16:22,935
Why have they arrested him?

1144
01:16:23,111 --> 01:16:24,203
He hasn't done anything wrong.

1145
01:16:24,346 --> 01:16:26,212
Jessie, I will never allow this.

1146
01:16:26,815 --> 01:16:29,113
You know, Roy Thomas,
he is Vice President.

1147
01:16:29,217 --> 01:16:30,446
Future Line in San Francisco.

1148
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:31,747
And who the hell is he?

1149
01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:33,278
A film director?

1150
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:35,785
And what future does he have?

1151
01:16:35,891 --> 01:16:37,655
And my God Jessie, he's a Hindu.

1152
01:16:37,793 --> 01:16:39,454
Don't you remember what
happened with your sister?

1153
01:16:42,030 --> 01:16:43,293
I promise you.

1154
01:16:44,666 --> 01:16:46,794
I won't ever talk to
him or see him again.

1155
01:16:50,639 --> 01:16:51,731
Jessie!

1156
01:16:51,873 --> 01:16:52,897
What about the wedding?

1157
01:17:06,855 --> 01:17:08,186
That's Jessie's dad.

1158
01:17:09,858 --> 01:17:10,916
Getup!

1159
01:17:20,135 --> 01:17:21,899
Why were you
staring at him like that?

1160
01:17:22,004 --> 01:17:23,597
Why do you have so
much anger inside you?

1161
01:17:23,739 --> 01:17:26,231
- And stop laughing.
- Listen..

1162
01:17:26,341 --> 01:17:28,002
Here's another idiot.

1163
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:31,374
Don't mess with us. I'm warning you.

1164
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:32,641
No, sir. We won't.

1165
01:17:34,016 --> 01:17:35,745
I don't know whyl
even bailed you guys out.

1166
01:17:35,851 --> 01:17:37,683
You'd have been
locked up for two weeks.

1167
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:38,843
No, sir.

1168
01:17:38,987 --> 01:17:41,684
Look, even Jessie will
not speak to you, at all.

1169
01:17:41,823 --> 01:17:43,552
Of course! Get lost from here.

1170
01:17:43,692 --> 01:17:44,853
Yes, sir.
Don't ever let me see you again!

1171
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:46,394
- No sir.
- Who are you?

1172
01:17:46,528 --> 01:17:47,791
Sir, I am a cameraman. As in..

1173
01:17:47,929 --> 01:17:49,954
You look like a decent guy. Why
don't you put some sense in him?

1174
01:17:50,098 --> 01:17:51,623
I will sir.
Do that! I will take care..

1175
01:17:51,733 --> 01:17:52,791
- And get lost!
- Sure sir.

1176
01:17:52,901 --> 01:17:54,426
Come on.

1177
01:17:54,536 --> 01:17:55,628
Yes, sir.

1178
01:18:03,078 --> 01:18:04,409
Even if everything works out..

1179
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:07,078
How are you going to deal
with her father and brother?

1180
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:13,518
They don't even
speak with you decently.

1181
01:18:14,456 --> 01:18:17,721
There's family stuff, having
dinner together and all, as well.

1182
01:18:18,994 --> 01:18:20,189
They hate you brother.

1183
01:18:20,295 --> 01:18:21,421
They hate you.

1184
01:18:21,563 --> 01:18:23,327
Sir, I don't care even a
bit about their hatred.

1185
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:26,460
All this can be sorted out in
minutes. But Jessie should say yes.

1186
01:18:30,439 --> 01:18:31,838
I want to meet Jessie, sir.

1187
01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:33,842
Sachin, are you
completely out of your mind?

1188
01:18:34,443 --> 01:18:36,309
I have some
responsibilities in life!

1189
01:18:36,411 --> 01:18:37,674
Even you are my responsibility!

1190
01:18:37,813 --> 01:18:38,871
You're not seeing her again!

1191
01:18:39,147 --> 01:18:40,444
- Sir please.
- No!

1192
01:18:41,483 --> 01:18:42,541
Sir, please.

1193
01:18:42,651 --> 01:18:43,846
You'll have us killed!

1194
01:18:48,523 --> 01:18:49,854
Why's the place lit up?

1195
01:18:49,991 --> 01:18:51,516
Did Jessie agree to the marriage?

1196
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:53,094
What? No, sir!

1197
01:19:04,473 --> 01:19:07,340
Sir, if you're caught,
don't mention my name.

1198
01:19:07,676 --> 01:19:09,940
Wait, that means
we could get caught!

1199
01:19:10,545 --> 01:19:12,411
The plan's cancelled.

1200
01:19:12,514 --> 01:19:14,141
Don't go. Don't.

1201
01:19:14,516 --> 01:19:15,950
I want to see you.

1202
01:19:16,384 --> 01:19:17,874
I want to talk to you, Sachin.

1203
01:19:19,321 --> 01:19:20,482
Just once.

1204
01:19:21,089 --> 01:19:22,250
Now.

1205
01:19:23,325 --> 01:19:25,054
Maybe for the last time.

1206
01:19:26,628 --> 01:19:28,153
Where are you, Sachin?

1207
01:19:31,133 --> 01:19:32,294
Sachin..

1208
01:19:34,402 --> 01:19:35,870
Sachin.

1209
01:19:36,805 --> 01:19:38,569
You are looking so beautiful today.

1210
01:19:39,374 --> 01:19:40,569
Even in your wedding saree.

1211
01:19:41,576 --> 01:19:43,806
You're crazy, mental.

1212
01:19:45,881 --> 01:19:49,283
I was thinking about
you and here you are.

1213
01:19:49,584 --> 01:19:51,018
In front of me.

1214
01:19:54,089 --> 01:19:55,181
I've seen you.

1215
01:19:55,323 --> 01:19:56,415
Now go away.

1216
01:19:56,558 --> 01:19:57,650
No one else must see you.

1217
01:19:57,759 --> 01:19:59,022
Go away.

1218
01:19:59,127 --> 01:20:01,289
Please, come out for a bit.

1219
01:20:01,396 --> 01:20:02,693
Please.

1220
01:20:02,798 --> 01:20:03,890
No..

1221
01:20:04,032 --> 01:20:05,158
Please.

1222
01:20:07,302 --> 01:20:09,703
Okay, You know what.. wait.

1223
01:20:10,205 --> 01:20:11,263
Ok ay.

1224
01:20:22,017 --> 01:20:23,246
Come here.

1225
01:20:27,589 --> 01:20:33,153
I promised dad that I won't
ever see you or speak with you.

1226
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:38,591
Promises are meant
to be broken, Jessie.

1227
01:20:41,002 --> 01:20:43,130
And thanks for
calling the wedding off.

1228
01:20:44,706 --> 01:20:46,071
That too in the church.

1229
01:20:47,809 --> 01:20:49,402
What guts, Jessie!

1230
01:20:50,879 --> 01:20:53,143
You didn't like that Roy Thomas?

1231
01:20:53,281 --> 01:20:54,510
I like you.

1232
01:20:56,985 --> 01:21:00,649
I'm in love with you, Sachin.

1233
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:21,400
If you had to figure out in a church,
you could've done that in Mumbai.

1234
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:24,346
Mumbai has some
really good churches.

1235
01:21:24,479 --> 01:21:26,208
And you even go to
church every Sunday.

1236
01:21:31,987 --> 01:21:33,318
I gave you a lot of trouble, right?

1237
01:21:34,456 --> 01:21:36,015
I literally chased you.

1238
01:21:37,058 --> 01:21:38,457
And you fell in love.

1239
01:21:40,862 --> 01:21:43,024
No, it's not that.

1240
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:46,459
I'd fallen in love
with you at first sight.

1241
01:21:47,302 --> 01:21:49,771
At that gate, that instant.

1242
01:21:51,072 --> 01:21:52,665
Every time I'd see you..

1243
01:21:52,774 --> 01:21:56,768
Your eyes would entreat me,
and I wanted to say so much.

1244
01:21:58,546 --> 01:22:01,607
And that day when we
met on the terrace..

1245
01:22:02,117 --> 01:22:04,586
I wanted to touch you.

1246
01:22:07,322 --> 01:22:10,383
When you proposed
to me, I got angry..

1247
01:22:10,492 --> 01:22:15,089
Only because I thought
you figured everything out.

1248
01:22:17,632 --> 01:22:20,533
Thank God you followed me to Kerala.

1249
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:22,131
To apologize.

1250
01:22:23,438 --> 01:22:24,667
I liked that.

1251
01:22:27,075 --> 01:22:31,103
Then you wrote "Friends" in the
train. I looked for you everywhere..

1252
01:22:31,246 --> 01:22:35,274
And the moment I saw you, my
heart beat faster than the train.

1253
01:22:38,687 --> 01:22:41,918
I didn't ever admit to it Sachin,
but that was love.

1254
01:22:43,391 --> 01:22:48,192
And when you kissed me,
I couldn't stop you.

1255
01:22:51,466 --> 01:22:52,865
Happy now?

1256
01:23:03,611 --> 01:23:05,238
Sachin, go away.

1257
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:07,814
I told you things would go wrong.

1258
01:23:07,949 --> 01:23:10,179
You.. You're a good person.

1259
01:23:11,219 --> 01:23:13,381
You don't deserve all this.

1260
01:23:15,790 --> 01:23:17,121
I am sorry.

1261
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:19,953
This is my fault.

1262
01:23:21,863 --> 01:23:23,922
All this is because of our love.

1263
01:23:26,668 --> 01:23:28,568
And you're an even
better person than me.

1264
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:32,496
Come away with me, let's go now..

1265
01:23:32,907 --> 01:23:34,375
I'll fix everything.

1266
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:39,641
Sit here.

1267
01:23:39,748 --> 01:23:40,806
Sit.

1268
01:23:41,983 --> 01:23:43,917
I'd come away with you right now.

1269
01:23:44,652 --> 01:23:46,086
I really love you.

1270
01:23:47,088 --> 01:23:49,455
All I want is that everything
should work out peacefully.

1271
01:23:49,991 --> 01:23:51,652
Even you want that, right?

1272
01:23:55,096 --> 01:23:57,190
I'll convince my dad.

1273
01:23:57,599 --> 01:24:01,297
I'll come to you, for you, Sachin!

1274
01:24:04,639 --> 01:24:07,108
You're talking like me now.

1275
01:24:08,176 --> 01:24:09,701
Strong and romantic.

1276
01:24:23,358 --> 01:24:24,792
I love you, Sachin.

1277
01:24:26,594 --> 01:24:27,993
I love you, Jessie.

1278
01:31:08,830 --> 01:31:11,800
Sachin, why are you just standing?
Show, na? Take number please.

1279
01:31:14,569 --> 01:31:15,695
Sachin!

1280
01:31:15,803 --> 01:31:17,066
Yes, sir.

1281
01:31:19,173 --> 01:31:23,201
Good Rahul, very good.
A little more energy, okay?

1282
01:31:27,782 --> 01:31:29,250
It's your first day, right?
Yes, sir.

1283
01:31:30,084 --> 01:31:31,779
- See that A.D. there?
- Yes sir.

1284
01:31:31,886 --> 01:31:36,448
She'll yell a lot,
she'll make you run around.

1285
01:31:36,891 --> 01:31:38,222
And..

1286
01:31:38,826 --> 01:31:41,056
You'll have to do what she says..
Yes, sir.

1287
01:31:41,162 --> 01:31:42,459
- Listen to her..
- Yes sir.

1288
01:31:42,563 --> 01:31:44,156
- And learn as well.
- Yes, sir.

1289
01:31:44,599 --> 01:31:45,964
- Clap!
- Yes sir.

1290
01:31:46,868 --> 01:31:48,302
Action!

1291
01:32:17,031 --> 01:32:18,226
Okay, listen.

1292
01:32:18,332 --> 01:32:19,424
Yes, sir.

1293
01:32:19,767 --> 01:32:21,735
Over there, near the sea..

1294
01:32:22,737 --> 01:32:24,728
The actor stands, sad..

1295
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:30,706
Just as we read his feelings,
the camera charges at him..

1296
01:32:31,445 --> 01:32:32,640
And then..

1297
01:32:33,047 --> 01:32:34,845
Rahman sir takes over.

1298
01:33:56,797 --> 01:33:58,162
Dad..

1299
01:34:00,534 --> 01:34:04,334
I will not entertain a conversation
about Sachin in this house anymore.

1300
01:34:04,472 --> 01:34:07,635
I will be happy, so you will be,
if you say yes to Roy.

1301
01:34:07,975 --> 01:34:09,875
Enough is enough, and it is done!

1302
01:34:22,723 --> 01:34:24,452
<i>37</i> by 4 take 1.

1303
01:34:28,562 --> 01:34:29,825
- Damn!
- Sorry, sorry, sir.

1304
01:34:35,603 --> 01:34:37,071
37 by 4 take..

1305
01:34:51,018 --> 01:34:52,349
Sachin..

1306
01:34:52,620 --> 01:34:53,815
Jessie..

1307
01:34:54,088 --> 01:34:55,453
What happened, Sachin?

1308
01:34:57,825 --> 01:34:59,987
No calls, no messages.

1309
01:35:01,095 --> 01:35:02,392
Me? I mean..

1310
01:35:02,496 --> 01:35:04,123
Jessie, you didn't reply.

1311
01:35:04,265 --> 01:35:06,029
I thought there was some problem.

1312
01:35:06,167 --> 01:35:08,693
The shoot went on all day and night.

1313
01:35:08,803 --> 01:35:10,532
- And signal..
- Sachin..

1314
01:35:10,671 --> 01:35:12,503
It's a huge mess out here..

1315
01:35:13,140 --> 01:35:14,608
I want to..

1316
01:35:15,342 --> 01:35:16,741
I'm coming there.

1317
01:35:18,112 --> 01:35:21,377
Tell me how to get
there from Mangalore.

1318
01:35:21,515 --> 01:35:23,449
What are you saying,
Jessie? What happened?

1319
01:35:23,551 --> 01:35:25,713
Same old.. Roy and all.

1320
01:35:26,220 --> 01:35:27,779
You'll get
irritated with it as well.

1321
01:35:27,922 --> 01:35:29,754
I want to come for you, Sachin.

1322
01:35:30,491 --> 01:35:32,118
I told you I would, in Kerala.

1323
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:34,594
Jessie.. where we are now..

1324
01:35:36,797 --> 01:35:38,424
You can't come here.

1325
01:35:40,401 --> 01:35:42,028
You shouldn't come here.

1326
01:35:43,671 --> 01:35:45,036
You don't want me to come?

1327
01:35:45,172 --> 01:35:46,640
That's not what I said, Jessie.

1328
01:35:47,875 --> 01:35:49,468
This place isn't right for you.

1329
01:35:50,845 --> 01:35:54,440
You'll be uncomfortable.
I'll be uncomfortable.

1330
01:35:55,483 --> 01:35:57,178
Try to understand, please.

1331
01:35:58,285 --> 01:36:00,913
I'll get back, we'll talk about it.

1332
01:36:01,555 --> 01:36:03,922
It'll work out. Relax.

1333
01:36:04,825 --> 01:36:07,123
You don't want to be with me.

1334
01:36:07,862 --> 01:36:09,956
And you aren't
letting me be with you.

1335
01:36:11,932 --> 01:36:15,562
In Kerala, you wanted me to come
away with you right that instant.

1336
01:36:17,171 --> 01:36:18,332
And now...?

1337
01:36:18,472 --> 01:36:22,272
You also refused then.
Didn't I understand?

1338
01:36:22,910 --> 01:36:24,674
Please calm down Jessie.

1339
01:36:25,613 --> 01:36:26,944
I'll come there

1340
01:36:28,883 --> 01:36:32,683
I have work here.
I've absolutely no time.

1341
01:36:35,122 --> 01:36:37,716
I'll come there. We'll
figure something out.

1342
01:36:37,858 --> 01:36:39,155
Okay, Jessie?

1343
01:36:41,028 --> 01:36:42,257
Jessie?

1344
01:36:44,131 --> 01:36:45,394
Jessie?

1345
01:36:45,533 --> 01:36:46,694
Jessie, are you there?

1346
01:36:48,068 --> 01:36:49,763
Jessie, can you hear me?

1347
01:36:51,605 --> 01:36:54,131
Yeah, Sachin. All right.

1348
01:36:54,742 --> 01:36:55,971
You come back.

1349
01:36:56,076 --> 01:36:57,441
We'll talk.

1350
01:36:57,545 --> 01:37:00,276
I'll wait, okay? Bye!

1351
01:37:01,115 --> 01:37:02,583
Jess.. Jessie..

1352
01:37:06,220 --> 01:37:08,917
This is the last and final boarding
call for passenger..

1353
01:37:09,023 --> 01:37:11,287
Jessie Joseph travelling
to Mangalore..

1354
01:37:11,392 --> 01:37:15,022
You are requested to
proceed to gate no <i>3</i> immediately.

1355
01:37:15,162 --> 01:37:17,927
This is the last and final
boarding call for passenger.

1356
01:37:18,032 --> 01:37:20,899
Jessie Joseph travelling on..

1357
01:37:44,124 --> 01:37:45,216
When did you talk to Jessie?

1358
01:37:45,326 --> 01:37:46,384
The night before last.

1359
01:37:46,493 --> 01:37:47,688
What's the plan?

1360
01:37:48,095 --> 01:37:50,564
Sir, I'll leave, and
get back in two days.

1361
01:37:50,664 --> 01:37:51,790
Hmm.

1362
01:37:51,932 --> 01:37:54,594
Please speak to Hamesh Sir..

1363
01:37:55,402 --> 01:37:56,995
I'll be back soon..

1364
01:37:57,638 --> 01:38:00,767
You talk to him. That'll be better.

1365
01:38:01,609 --> 01:38:03,771
Okay. Go.

1366
01:38:05,212 --> 01:38:06,475
Sir..

1367
01:38:06,580 --> 01:38:07,706
'An.

1368
01:38:07,815 --> 01:38:11,615
Deal with the matters of your
heart first Then come back.

1369
01:38:12,186 --> 01:38:13,620
Work will be even more fun.

1370
01:38:15,422 --> 01:38:16,617
Go.

1371
01:38:23,397 --> 01:38:26,128
Turn left from the HDFC bank.

1372
01:38:45,152 --> 01:38:46,517
What is it now, Sachin?

1373
01:38:47,154 --> 01:38:48,644
What does this message mean?

1374
01:38:53,928 --> 01:38:55,191
What do you mean it's over?

1375
01:38:56,130 --> 01:38:57,393
What do you mean it's over?

1376
01:38:58,666 --> 01:38:59,758
What do you mean?

1377
01:38:59,867 --> 01:39:02,700
No need to yell. Stop it!

1378
01:39:04,371 --> 01:39:05,770
Sachin..

1379
01:39:12,313 --> 01:39:13,576
Listen ..

1380
01:39:15,716 --> 01:39:17,013
Sachin..

1381
01:39:17,117 --> 01:39:18,312
We need to talk.

1382
01:39:29,863 --> 01:39:32,355
Here I <i>am</i>, just for you.

1383
01:39:32,833 --> 01:39:35,894
Instead of being at
the shoot, at work.

1384
01:39:36,537 --> 01:39:37,834
What do you want?

1385
01:39:37,938 --> 01:39:39,235
Where do you want to go?

1386
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:41,239
What's the problem?

1387
01:39:41,709 --> 01:39:44,610
It's all over,
Sachin. Please let me go.

1388
01:39:44,745 --> 01:39:45,803
It's over.

1389
01:39:45,913 --> 01:39:47,108
You wrote that in
the m message already.

1390
01:39:47,214 --> 01:39:49,979
But why? Why.. that's
what I want to know.

1391
01:39:50,250 --> 01:39:51,843
Nothing's so wrong
that you're doing this.

1392
01:39:51,952 --> 01:39:54,284
Everything was fine 20
days go. Things were great.

1393
01:39:55,556 --> 01:39:57,217
What's the problem now, Jessie?

1394
01:40:01,929 --> 01:40:04,899
Three days ago you
wanted to leave everything..

1395
01:40:05,032 --> 01:40:06,158
And come to me.

1396
01:40:06,300 --> 01:40:07,495
And now..

1397
01:40:08,435 --> 01:40:09,664
It's over!

1398
01:40:11,105 --> 01:40:13,005
The moment has gone, Sachin.

1399
01:40:13,107 --> 01:40:15,542
That moment is no more.

1400
01:40:19,646 --> 01:40:21,307
Because I told you not to come?

1401
01:40:22,082 --> 01:40:23,311
Don't come now?

1402
01:40:24,785 --> 01:40:26,879
That's why? Right, Jessie?

1403
01:40:27,287 --> 01:40:28,686
Because I told you not to come?

1404
01:40:32,426 --> 01:40:33,655
Or is it your dad..

1405
01:40:35,262 --> 01:40:36,821
He said something again?

1406
01:40:38,432 --> 01:40:40,093
I'll talk to him as well!

1407
01:40:42,069 --> 01:40:43,332
I don't care, Sachin.

1408
01:40:47,708 --> 01:40:49,369
I don't love you anymore.

1409
01:40:50,010 --> 01:40:51,444
I don't care anymore.

1410
01:40:55,049 --> 01:40:57,313
And stop talking such
rubbish about my dad.

1411
01:41:10,898 --> 01:41:12,366
What's happened, Jessie?

1412
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:14,968
Where did I go wrong?

1413
01:41:17,037 --> 01:41:18,266
Jessie..

1414
01:41:21,875 --> 01:41:25,470
It's not you. It's not my dad. It's
not our religions. It's me, Sachin.

1415
01:41:25,579 --> 01:41:26,774
It's me.

1416
01:41:28,582 --> 01:41:30,346
I'm not made for you.

1417
01:41:31,785 --> 01:41:35,517
Why did you love me like crazy..
What had I done?

1418
01:41:37,324 --> 01:41:39,122
I just walked past you, that's all.

1419
01:41:41,361 --> 01:41:43,762
You kept on chasing me..

1420
01:41:43,864 --> 01:41:44,956
Why?

1421
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:54,166
Jessie.

1422
01:41:54,608 --> 01:41:56,007
I told you not to.

1423
01:41:56,610 --> 01:41:57,907
But you didn't listen.

1424
01:42:00,180 --> 01:42:02,877
And I too fell in love
with you. I'm so sorry.

1425
01:42:06,553 --> 01:42:09,784
And you know what,
now it hurts, yes.

1426
01:42:10,290 --> 01:42:11,621
But I like it.

1427
01:42:14,061 --> 01:42:17,326
And I hate cinema.
I hate your world..

1428
01:42:18,899 --> 01:42:20,890
The darkness.. the crowd..

1429
01:42:23,570 --> 01:42:25,197
And you want to make films?

1430
01:42:25,339 --> 01:42:26,670
Yes, Sachin?

1431
01:42:28,976 --> 01:42:30,205
We were wrong from the start.

1432
01:42:30,310 --> 01:42:31,709
Completely wrong!

1433
01:42:33,814 --> 01:42:35,578
But I've never felt better.

1434
01:42:35,883 --> 01:42:39,410
But we both should feel it right?
That isn't happening.

1435
01:42:40,988 --> 01:42:46,051
And somehow, I can live with you
hating me, but not my parents.

1436
01:42:47,361 --> 01:42:50,729
I've given it a lot of thought,
and I'm tired now.

1437
01:42:51,565 --> 01:42:52,930
This can't be fixed.

1438
01:42:53,901 --> 01:42:55,596
I must go, Sachin.

1439
01:42:55,702 --> 01:42:57,363
I can't let you go, Jessie.

1440
01:42:57,771 --> 01:43:01,730
I'll wait.. forever. Don't worry..

1441
01:43:02,476 --> 01:43:04,444
There are problems but
problems can be solved, Jessie.

1442
01:43:04,778 --> 01:43:06,906
Sachin, let me go please.

1443
01:43:10,417 --> 01:43:13,352
I can't let you go, Jessie. No way!

1444
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:15,518
I don't love you anymore.

1445
01:43:17,558 --> 01:43:20,892
And it will be easy
for you to forget me..

1446
01:43:21,962 --> 01:43:23,953
It will probably be more
difficult for me to fall..

1447
01:43:24,064 --> 01:43:25,657
In love with you again.

1448
01:43:38,712 --> 01:43:40,441
You don't mean that, Jessie.

1449
01:43:44,484 --> 01:43:45,918
That was it.

1450
01:43:46,954 --> 01:43:48,854
Jessie walked out of my life.

1451
01:43:55,829 --> 01:43:59,766
I stood there for an hour that
night. She didn't come back.

1452
01:44:00,601 --> 01:44:02,160
She should have come but..

1453
01:44:12,913 --> 01:44:14,904
Please don't hate me.

1454
01:44:18,552 --> 01:44:19,747
I'm sorry Sachin.

1455
01:44:32,532 --> 01:44:33,863
This is madness!

1456
01:44:35,135 --> 01:44:36,728
Nothing made sense!

1457
01:44:37,904 --> 01:44:39,872
It was a one way
ticket to heartbreak city.

1458
01:44:40,907 --> 01:44:43,569
Jessie showed me the middle finger,
and walked out of my life.

1459
01:45:00,927 --> 01:45:02,088
Was she there?

1460
01:45:04,264 --> 01:45:05,595
She's married.

1461
01:45:10,737 --> 01:45:12,000
She isn't here now.

1462
01:45:13,073 --> 01:45:14,632
She is in UK.

1463
01:45:21,682 --> 01:45:25,380
Sachin, forget her and move on.

1464
01:45:34,161 --> 01:45:35,253
Sound.

1465
01:45:35,362 --> 01:45:37,353
Rolling. - 96 by 2 take 1.

1466
01:45:37,464 --> 01:45:38,659
Clap. - Sachin out. - Action.

1467
01:45:38,765 --> 01:45:40,529
Follow him closely. Water
should not fall on the camera.

1468
01:45:51,044 --> 01:45:53,240
Because of you, all of us
got yelled at yesterday!

1469
01:45:53,647 --> 01:45:55,911
As if you're the only one
who does any work around here.

1470
01:45:56,883 --> 01:45:58,908
Anyway, I forgive you.

1471
01:45:59,453 --> 01:46:01,046
You don't need to kneel down.

1472
01:46:05,792 --> 01:46:08,022
You've assisted sir in the
scripting as well, right?

1473
01:46:10,564 --> 01:46:12,225
Don't jump on a high horse.

1474
01:46:12,332 --> 01:46:14,323
Sir will cut you to
size one of these days.

1475
01:46:14,935 --> 01:46:16,164
Okay?

1476
01:46:23,610 --> 01:46:25,578
41 by7 take A.

1477
01:46:27,147 --> 01:46:28,740
Film-making is a creative process.

1478
01:46:28,882 --> 01:46:29,940
There's a bit of creative tension..

1479
01:46:30,050 --> 01:46:30,812
And a bit of creative
shouting as well.

1480
01:46:30,917 --> 01:46:32,442
I love you all!
Absolutely no problem.

1481
01:46:32,586 --> 01:46:33,747
I introduced you to Hamesh Sippy.

1482
01:46:33,854 --> 01:46:35,083
Now you're upset that he's angry.

1483
01:46:35,188 --> 01:46:36,747
He yelled at me'

1484
01:46:36,857 --> 01:46:38,791
Which cameraman treats
you to sweets like this?

1485
01:46:41,561 --> 01:46:42,619
After you.

1486
01:46:42,763 --> 01:46:43,889
It's okay. You go.

1487
01:46:45,165 --> 01:46:46,496
There's something I have to say.

1488
01:46:50,804 --> 01:46:52,636
I don't know what's on your mind..

1489
01:46:52,939 --> 01:46:54,703
Or what you feel about me.

1490
01:46:55,909 --> 01:46:57,138
But I like you.

1491
01:46:58,812 --> 01:47:00,211
I really like you.

1492
01:47:03,650 --> 01:47:04,776
It's like..

1493
01:47:06,953 --> 01:47:09,752
I hated you at first.

1494
01:47:10,757 --> 01:47:13,488
What I see in her eyes.. - And
now I just want to be around you.

1495
01:47:13,593 --> 01:47:15,857
Was in my eyes for Jessie once.

1496
01:47:16,863 --> 01:47:18,024
Was..

1497
01:47:18,131 --> 01:47:19,530
I cannot accept.

1498
01:47:20,500 --> 01:47:24,266
Sol felt that I should
immortalize this into a story.

1499
01:47:25,772 --> 01:47:27,399
My story and Jessie's story.

1500
01:47:28,642 --> 01:47:30,440
Jessie's story and My story.

1501
01:49:23,490 --> 01:49:25,015
Sir, my film is finalized.

1502
01:49:25,125 --> 01:49:27,093
What? Really?

1503
01:49:27,861 --> 01:49:31,695
I personally wanted to
give you the advance cheque.

1504
01:49:31,798 --> 01:49:32,993
So sweet of you!

1505
01:49:33,099 --> 01:49:35,693
And I specially spoke to
the producers about it.

1506
01:49:35,835 --> 01:49:37,166
Sir.. please.

1507
01:49:37,270 --> 01:49:38,499
Wonderful!

1508
01:49:40,540 --> 01:49:41,871
Congratulations!

1509
01:49:42,542 --> 01:49:43,634
And thank you.

1510
01:49:45,579 --> 01:49:46,671
Good.

1511
01:49:46,813 --> 01:49:48,042
Thank you, sir.

1512
01:49:48,815 --> 01:49:51,546
What's the title of
your movie? Jessie?

1513
01:49:54,454 --> 01:49:55,512
Sir, you're a genius.

1514
01:49:56,489 --> 01:49:58,787
Also I.. I just love
the way it begins.

1515
01:49:58,892 --> 01:50:00,986
Why did the circle of
love have to stop at Jessie?

1516
01:50:01,795 --> 01:50:05,595
Brilliant.. sir this is the one,
I definitely want to do this.

1517
01:50:05,699 --> 01:50:06,791
Sam.

1518
01:50:07,067 --> 01:50:08,262
You should play Jessie.

1519
01:50:08,401 --> 01:50:09,459
Wh at?

1520
01:50:09,803 --> 01:50:11,202
What are you saying?

1521
01:50:12,372 --> 01:50:13,737
Why don't you play Jessie's part?

1522
01:50:13,873 --> 01:50:15,898
Are you mad? Tell me who you want.

1523
01:50:16,009 --> 01:50:18,671
We'll go look around.
We'll find someone.

1524
01:50:18,778 --> 01:50:19,904
YOU.

1525
01:52:39,986 --> 01:52:44,048
So you have become
a director finally!

1526
01:52:45,391 --> 01:52:46,449
Hmm.

1527
01:53:02,008 --> 01:53:03,703
Do you have
someone in your life now?

1528
01:53:09,949 --> 01:53:11,439
There is someone,
isn't there, Sachin?

1529
01:53:16,689 --> 01:53:20,182
I'm sure there must be someone.

1530
01:53:23,730 --> 01:53:27,963
Someone better than me,
less confused.

1531
01:53:36,876 --> 01:53:39,311
Yes, there is someone.

1532
01:53:49,689 --> 01:53:53,648
Who is she? I mean,
tell me about her.

1533
01:53:55,528 --> 01:53:56,620
She's beautiful.

1534
01:53:58,097 --> 01:53:59,394
She loves me a lot.

1535
01:54:01,401 --> 01:54:02,562
Hmm.

1536
01:54:11,044 --> 01:54:12,603
One day she told me

1537
01:54:14,113 --> 01:54:15,842
that she fell in love
with me at first sight.

1538
01:54:17,283 --> 01:54:18,512
It's been two years now.

1539
01:54:19,285 --> 01:54:22,050
I was very angry when you left.

1540
01:54:23,356 --> 01:54:25,120
Nothing was making sense in life.

1541
01:54:28,828 --> 01:54:31,923
But when I met her,
everything became fine again.

1542
01:54:32,832 --> 01:54:35,233
She's very nice. She's a good girl.

1543
01:54:37,470 --> 01:54:38,596
Tell me more..

1544
01:54:39,739 --> 01:54:40,831
She is simple.

1545
01:54:43,810 --> 01:54:45,005
No makeup.

1546
01:54:45,478 --> 01:54:47,173
Only a little

1547
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:49,341
when she's out with me.

1548
01:54:53,219 --> 01:54:57,486
Her hair curls at the bottom,
and is straight near the top.

1549
01:55:00,526 --> 01:55:02,221
She never raises her voice.

1550
01:55:04,464 --> 01:55:07,729
She's one of those delicate,
calm girls.

1551
01:55:13,206 --> 01:55:15,766
I don't even notice
anything else when she's with me.

1552
01:55:19,479 --> 01:55:20,571
Saree..

1553
01:55:22,282 --> 01:55:24,910
She looks amazing in a saree.

1554
01:55:28,955 --> 01:55:30,889
She loves to wear sarees.

1555
01:55:36,562 --> 01:55:40,294
She's madly in love with me.

1556
01:55:42,535 --> 01:55:45,937
We ride a lot on my bike.

1557
01:55:48,675 --> 01:55:50,109
I've kissed her too.

1558
01:55:54,180 --> 01:55:58,276
We're always in each other's
heart's.. and in each other's arms.

1559
01:56:02,522 --> 01:56:05,548
We meet anywhere, at anytime.
We go almost everywhere together.

1560
01:56:07,493 --> 01:56:09,052
Only, movies..

1561
01:56:11,197 --> 01:56:12,926
She doesn't like movies.

1562
01:56:14,834 --> 01:56:16,165
I don't know why.

1563
01:56:19,372 --> 01:56:25,141
When she speaks Hindi,
there's a slight Malayalam accent.

1564
01:56:27,680 --> 01:56:29,546
But I like it nevertheless.

1565
01:56:33,386 --> 01:56:34,683
Her name is..

1566
01:56:36,089 --> 01:56:38,717
Jessie, Jessie.

1567
01:56:52,939 --> 01:56:55,704
After you left, she's the
one that took care of me.

1568
01:56:56,376 --> 01:56:58,037
Otherwise I would have been a mess.

1569
01:57:00,980 --> 01:57:03,745
After you left, Jessie,
I had given up on life.

1570
01:57:05,518 --> 01:57:07,247
You can't ever
forget your first love.

1571
01:57:09,956 --> 01:57:12,084
Getting over you was
very difficult, Jessie.

1572
01:57:20,133 --> 01:57:23,797
It's only because she was
in my heart that I'm okay.

1573
01:57:27,974 --> 01:57:30,033
But I'm not a part
of her life either.

1574
01:57:32,111 --> 01:57:33,545
She's married.

1575
01:57:34,280 --> 01:57:36,442
She also loves her parents.

1576
01:57:38,785 --> 01:57:40,514
She can do anything for them.

1577
01:57:41,454 --> 01:57:43,684
She'd even leave me, her love.

1578
01:57:50,029 --> 01:57:54,933
Very few girls can sacrifice
love for the sake of their parents.

1579
01:57:57,570 --> 01:57:59,038
I salute her.

1580
01:57:59,672 --> 01:58:00,935
She is brave.

1581
01:58:02,675 --> 01:58:04,302
But none of that matters, Jessie.

1582
01:58:05,178 --> 01:58:06,612
She'll always be in my heart.

1583
01:58:09,048 --> 01:58:10,709
She herself would not
like to leave from my heart.

1584
01:58:13,453 --> 01:58:16,548
And if at all she does go,
she'll tell me before leaving.

1585
01:58:17,290 --> 01:58:18,780
Not like you..

1586
01:58:20,326 --> 01:58:21,816
Who left without informing.

1587
01:58:26,299 --> 01:58:30,065
Sorry, I shouldn't have said that.

1588
01:58:36,742 --> 01:58:39,040
I'm still not married, Sachin.

1589
01:58:42,815 --> 01:58:47,343
I left you, but I
couldn't forget you.

1590
01:58:49,355 --> 01:58:50,880
I am not married, Sachin.

1591
01:58:53,759 --> 01:58:59,596
My dad didn't like you,
and I didn't like his choice.

1592
01:59:05,138 --> 01:59:07,300
I've been in Delhi for
the past six months.

1593
01:59:08,741 --> 01:59:10,641
Dad's still trying to convince me.

1594
01:59:12,845 --> 01:59:14,870
He was here, he left last week.

1595
01:59:16,349 --> 01:59:17,646
He wants me to get married

1596
01:59:18,317 --> 01:59:19,443
I refused.

1597
01:59:20,920 --> 01:59:22,081
He left in a huff

1598
01:59:26,025 --> 01:59:27,720
I have not been able to forget you.

1599
01:59:31,164 --> 01:59:33,132
I will never be able
to either, Sachin.

1600
01:59:36,302 --> 01:59:38,498
You were my first love too, Sachin.

1601
01:59:39,172 --> 01:59:41,038
It's not been easy for me either.

1602
01:59:42,408 --> 01:59:44,467
I'm sorry I couldn't
see you before I left

1603
01:59:45,244 --> 01:59:48,009
I thought you'd get
over me with time.

1604
01:59:50,082 --> 01:59:52,915
But I was wrong.

1605
01:59:54,787 --> 01:59:57,051
I thought you'll move on. I
was so wrong. I'm so sorry.

1606
02:00:14,941 --> 02:00:16,670
But why is all this happening again?

1607
02:00:18,611 --> 02:00:22,343
[Of all the days I choose to
come to see the Ta], you're here!

1608
02:00:23,616 --> 02:00:26,551
Did you have to come
here today, Sachin?

1609
02:00:28,387 --> 02:00:30,014
I don't want all this again.

1610
02:00:32,592 --> 02:00:33,889
In fact, I'm leaving.

1611
02:00:37,396 --> 02:00:38,420
Jessie.

1612
02:00:40,766 --> 02:00:41,892
Jessie.

1613
02:00:48,741 --> 02:00:50,140
Let's get married, Jessie!

1614
02:00:52,378 --> 02:00:55,678
Please, right now.
Right this instant.

1615
02:00:59,285 --> 02:01:00,514
If we let this moment pass..

1616
02:01:01,053 --> 02:01:02,487
Ten years later when we meet..

1617
02:01:02,588 --> 02:01:04,852
You will ask me why
we let this moment go.

1618
02:01:05,791 --> 02:01:07,418
Jessie, nothing will change.

1619
02:01:07,860 --> 02:01:09,624
Ten years, twenty
years all through life.

1620
02:01:09,729 --> 02:01:11,356
Nothing will change between us.

1621
02:01:12,765 --> 02:01:14,494
We didn't meet today by chance.

1622
02:01:15,668 --> 02:01:17,363
It wasn't just by chance even then.

1623
02:01:18,504 --> 02:01:20,768
What we felt in that
moment that our eyes met.

1624
02:01:20,873 --> 02:01:21,999
That was love.

1625
02:01:23,442 --> 02:01:25,501
There is something here,
something that's just ours.

1626
02:01:26,912 --> 02:01:29,643
Let's get married. Today. Right now.

1627
02:01:30,616 --> 02:01:31,845
Holy mother of God.

1628
02:01:33,686 --> 02:01:35,620
It'll be a new life, a new start.

1629
02:01:36,555 --> 02:01:38,080
Come on, Jessie. Please.

1630
02:01:38,324 --> 02:01:39,485
Say yes.

1631
02:01:39,859 --> 02:01:43,318
Say yes, Jessie. Please,
Say yes. Jessie, please.

1632
02:01:44,230 --> 02:01:45,322
Jessie.

1633
02:01:47,967 --> 02:01:48,991
Yes.

1634
02:01:49,568 --> 02:01:50,694
Yes.

1635
02:02:15,061 --> 02:02:16,187
There's a board here.

1636
02:02:18,164 --> 02:02:20,531
It says that indecent
behavior in the park..

1637
02:02:21,233 --> 02:02:22,758
Is a punishable of fence.

1638
02:02:27,106 --> 02:02:28,733
Even if I'm arrested..

1639
02:02:29,909 --> 02:02:31,308
I don't care

1640
02:02:33,145 --> 02:02:34,579
I want to kiss you, Jessie.

1641
02:02:36,115 --> 02:02:38,675
Please let me kiss you.
Yes, please kiss me.

1642
02:06:49,401 --> 02:06:50,698
Yes, coming!

1643
02:06:55,307 --> 02:06:56,399
Jessie..

1644
02:06:59,745 --> 02:07:00,735
Dad..

1645
02:07:11,357 --> 02:07:13,826
They didn't show her
father's reaction.

1646
02:07:13,926 --> 02:07:15,121
That's not important.

1647
02:07:15,427 --> 02:07:16,724
Good thing is, the
couple got together at last.

1648
02:07:16,862 --> 02:07:18,125
So, how did you like the movie?

1649
02:07:18,230 --> 02:07:20,221
Very much. No doubt. It's a hit.

1650
02:07:24,903 --> 02:07:26,268
How did you like the film?

1651
02:07:29,141 --> 02:07:30,336
I really liked it.

1652
02:07:34,146 --> 02:07:35,272
I could see myself.

1653
02:07:35,881 --> 02:07:38,145
I mean both of us

1654
02:07:38,250 --> 02:07:39,843
our life.

1655
02:07:41,887 --> 02:07:43,446
Same house, Sachin?

1656
02:07:45,257 --> 02:07:46,850
The house had to be the same.

1657
02:07:53,532 --> 02:07:56,331
But I wasn't that nice to you.

1658
02:07:57,870 --> 02:07:59,429
Yeah, agreed.

1659
02:08:00,706 --> 02:08:05,473
But I thought I'd make you
look good in the movie at least.

1660
02:08:08,113 --> 02:08:11,139
Yeah, Nikhil! What are you saying?

1661
02:08:11,450 --> 02:08:14,613
Seriously? - Hasn't Anay sir
done a superb job? - Yeah seriously.

1662
02:08:14,853 --> 02:08:18,721
Holy mother of God..
It's a super hit!

1663
02:08:18,857 --> 02:08:20,621
You hit the jackpot at first try.

1664
02:08:20,893 --> 02:08:22,657
What a great movie, buddy!

1665
02:08:22,761 --> 02:08:24,957
Even I've done a damn good job.
The movie's looking great.

1666
02:08:25,097 --> 02:08:26,428
Nikhil had just called
Did you like it?

1667
02:08:26,532 --> 02:08:28,432
I liked it a lot. - It's about
your life anyway eh? - Yeah.

1668
02:08:28,534 --> 02:08:29,797
Had a good time?
Very good. Good.

1669
02:08:29,902 --> 02:08:31,870
Good. Okay, now
let's head to PVR Juhu.

1670
02:08:32,004 --> 02:08:33,494
Let's watch it with
the audience there.

1671
02:08:33,639 --> 02:08:36,438
Jessie, come along. You both
com e together. It'll be great.

1672
02:08:36,575 --> 02:08:37,633
Ramesh Sippy Sir's there already.

1673
02:08:37,743 --> 02:08:40,678
Vijay, Aalif, everyone's coming.
Congratulations!

1674
02:08:41,246 --> 02:08:45,342
Anay sir gets a little too excited.

1675
02:08:47,052 --> 02:08:49,020
We'll get to know on Monday.

1676
02:08:49,788 --> 02:08:52,018
Everyone's praising you.

1677
02:08:52,691 --> 02:08:56,559
Everyone other than me seems
to know how talented you are.

1678
02:09:00,332 --> 02:09:01,424
Sachin,

1679
02:09:01,533 --> 02:09:06,061
you should've married someone
who's watched at least 25 movies.

1680
02:09:07,539 --> 02:09:09,007
Why me?

1681
02:09:09,108 --> 02:09:12,442
Because I need you
to make good movies.

1682
02:09:17,583 --> 02:09:20,951
I almost cried during the Tajmahal scene.

1683
02:09:21,687 --> 02:09:23,314
- I know.
- How?

1684
02:09:25,124 --> 02:09:28,526
While you were watching the movie,
I was watching you.

1685
02:09:29,228 --> 02:09:31,458
You're my real audience, Jessie.

1686
02:09:32,898 --> 02:09:36,994
And hello, when did we
ever kiss in the park?

1687
02:09:37,770 --> 02:09:38,862
Don't laugh!

1688
02:09:38,971 --> 02:09:43,966
Sachin, I clearly remember you
hugged me then looked at me..

1689
02:09:44,076 --> 02:09:45,669
And hugged me again.

1690
02:09:46,245 --> 02:09:47,406
When did you kiss?

1691
02:09:51,817 --> 02:09:54,514
That's the kiss that
gave my life back to me.

1692
02:09:56,522 --> 02:09:57,819
No chance!

1693
02:10:01,994 --> 02:10:04,190
Idea! Let's get dad
to watch the movie.

1694
02:10:04,763 --> 02:10:07,357
Maybe he'll
understand you better then.

1695
02:10:08,033 --> 02:10:09,194
What say?

1696
02:10:09,802 --> 02:10:15,571
Now it's just a stray 'hello'.
Maybe he'll start talking to you.

1697
02:10:20,112 --> 02:10:21,273
You get him!

1698
02:10:23,615 --> 02:10:26,209
I'm not so sure such
a miracle can happen.

1699
02:10:33,425 --> 02:10:36,019
Jessie, I'll just do the
rounds of a few theatres.

1700
02:10:36,628 --> 02:10:39,427
I'll drop you home first, come.

1701
02:10:39,798 --> 02:10:41,391
I'll come with you.

1702
02:10:42,768 --> 02:10:48,104
But you don't like the crowd,
the darkness, the noise..

1703
02:10:48,373 --> 02:10:51,468
Sachin, just take
me along, will you?

1704
02:10:52,477 --> 02:10:56,880
Okay. Come on. You and your dad...!

1705
02:10:57,015 --> 02:11:00,280
Papa.. daddy.. father.
Okay. Shall we, Sachin?

1706
02:11:00,519 --> 02:11:03,819
No, really. I'm serious.
I can't figure you guys out.

1707
02:11:04,690 --> 02:11:06,522
- You're bizarre folk.
- Bizarre?

1708
02:11:06,658 --> 02:11:08,183
- Bizarre?
- What is that?!

1709
02:11:08,293 --> 02:11:10,990
Now that you've become a writer
and director, don't use such words.
