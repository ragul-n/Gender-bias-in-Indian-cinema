You Tube search name - Musafir - 1957

3
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,820
[Narrator] There are countless houses...

4
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,050
and innumerable people
who reside in them.

5
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,841
These houses stand mute witness
to the joys and sorrows...

6
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,510
the laughter and tears
of these countless millions.

7
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,690
These people come here
as travelers...

8
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:02,390
reside for a while
and then leave.

9
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,750
Birth occurs here,
so do weddings...

10
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,160
and so does death.

11
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:14,810
Musafir is the story of three tenants
who go through this cycle of life.

12
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,430
Who, one after the other...

13
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,950
come to stay in this house.

14
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,950
- Hey, bring that here.
- Just wait a sec, sir.

15
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,950
[Scattered conversation]

16
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:34,950
[lnaudible conversation]

17
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:39,840
Hey, Mohan, what are you
staring at? Do your job!

18
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,060
Hey, bring some water.

19
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,580
Here's my house.

20
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,616
You won't find another house like this
in the whole world, Ajay babu.

21
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,670
But yes, you will find the
entire world inside this house.

22
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:58,290
Hundreds have come here,
thousands have left.

23
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,976
- Wow!
- You already approve of it?

24
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,020
- I knew it!
- Not the house...

25
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:08,630
- I was looking at that.
- What? - This 'To let' board.

26
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,740
Today, you can get
a child on demand...

27
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,086
even wealth and good fortune.
But you never spot a 'To let' board.

28
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:18,520
Correct! You speak
the absolute truth.

29
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:20,919
That's because it's on
the outskirts of the city.

30
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:24,910
I've been a bit cautious in
the matter of my tenants.

31
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,600
It doesn't matter if my tenants
like me or not...

32
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,070
I don't approve of them
very easily.

33
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,840
It's not as if their character
is engraved on their foreheads.

34
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,560
Whether they are escaped
prisoners or murderers...

35
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:39,110
whether they've eloped
with the girl, or...

36
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,180
I'm not talking about you.

37
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,520
I couldn't find a more respectable
person than you if I tried.

38
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,970
- Well, what's the rent for this house?
- Rent?

39
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,906
Why don't you look
over the house first?

40
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,660
I'll quote the rent later. Come.

41
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,970
Some may say that Rs.80 is
too much for this house.

42
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,870
But you tell me...

43
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:03,590
For Rs.80, you get a view, a balcony,
three rooms, a kitchen, a bathroom...

44
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,190
It's not a house, it's Kamadhenu,
the wish-fulfilling cow...

45
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,510
which doesn't eat much
but gives a lot of milk.

46
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,780
With the dung for free. [Snatches
of song] That's the icing on the cake.

47
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:17,846
There's music 24 hours a day. You may
listen to it whenever you please.

48
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,980
- And if one doesn't wish to?
- What's the problem?

49
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,800
Simply stuff your ears
with cotton. Come...

50
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:26,000
- View the house.
- On the waves of the ocean...

51
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,350
[snatches of song]
This is the front room.

52
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,920
The other two rooms
are as big...

53
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,530
but the workers built
them in such a way...

54
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,550
they seem bigger than this room.

55
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,716
They are airy, well-lit;
you won't face any problems.

56
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:48,410
- [Song continues in the background.]
- I like it. - Huh?

57
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:53,600
You liked the house? But you
haven't seen the kitchen yet.

58
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,980
It's not necessary.

59
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:04,336
A crazy world is drowning
itself in the brightness...

60
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,070
Here's the rent for
15 days in advance...

61
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,456
I'll pay you the balance
by next Friday.

62
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,660
What's the hurry? You could have
paid me when you came to stay.

63
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,790
I'm not a greedy for men,
Ajay babu.

64
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:17,080
- Huh?
- I mean, I'm not greedy for money.

65
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:20,756
- Okay. Listen... - Yes?
- I need two charpais.

66
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,630
Of course. You will
have them.

67
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,041
I'll have the whole place cleaned
as well before you come.

68
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,760
- Okay, I'll take your leave now.
- So that's it!

69
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,640
You're going to bring your wife?

70
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:33,170
Wife? Yes, of course.

71
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:37,510
No life without wife! That's why
you didn't view the kitchen.

72
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,576
That's alright too. What would
you know of kitchens?

73
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,920
- Here, take this.
- Thank you. - Come.

74
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,990
My god! What's that?

75
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,590
Oh, that's nothing,
just a fight.

76
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,700
- What sort of fight?
- An old feud between Lord Vishnu and Mother Kali.

77
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:03,346
- What do you mean?
- Look, on this side is Vishnu Restaurant.

78
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:06,340
- Oh.
- And on that side is the Maha Kali Hindu Hotel.

79
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:11,560
- When competition intensifies, they play one song after another.
- Oh.

80
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,640
And we benefit from it.

81
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:17,020
If you stand here, you can listen
to devotional songs...

82
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,670
and over there, you can listen to
those that delight your soul.

83
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,760
And in the middle, is a
complete mess of both genres.

84
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:26,790
- Alright, give me leave...
- Take the name of the Lord and enter the house.

85
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,610
- I'll come next Friday.
- Alright.

86
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:39,090
The questions your eyes ask mine,
silently, secretly...

87
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:45,730
And wordlessly,
my eyes command...

88
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,640
You have come here, Shakun.
What are you scared of, now?

89
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,810
- Oh!
- What happened?

90
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,450
Oh, in our hurry, we forgot
to bring light bulbs.

91
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:22,720
- There's a shop opposite the house.
- No! - What do you mean, no?

92
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:28,190
- Don't go. - But, without a light, how...
- Whatever it is, don't leave me alone.

93
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,680
Oh, I saw a half-burned
candle here earlier.

94
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:36,989
If anyone has...
ah, got it!

95
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,540
You aren't scared now, are you?
Of whom are you scared?

96
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:26,580
What if uncle spots us
while wandering around?

97
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,040
Uncle must be dealing with
that old scoundrel...

98
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,520
- to whom you were to be married.
- No, no.

99
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:38,560
Uncle must be searching
every nook and corner for me.

100
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:42,400
- What if he has the faintest suspicion?
- He won't, yet...

101
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:46,390
What if we are caught tomorrow?
We'll call the priest in the morning...

102
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:50,620
and we'll be bound in a relationship
that even God cannot undo.

103
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:59,190
Right, Shakuntala, you must be
tired from the day's travails...

104
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:02,410
this suitcase has everything you
need. Change and go to sleep.

105
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:05,990
- And... and you?
- I'll go to sleep too.

106
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,936
- Where?
- In this very room.

107
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,070
No... no, that can't be.

108
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:13,810
Because we aren't
married, right?

109
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,860
So why are you worried? You sleep
in that room, I'll sleep in this. Okay?

110
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:24,030
Shakuntala... don't you trust me?

111
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:31,330
If I didn't trust you, would I have
come away with you?

112
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:33,270
Shakuntala!

113
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,270
- Hey, you're crying, Shakun?
- Why did you bring me here?

114
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:21,740
Why did you risk infamy?

115
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,510
What if your parents
don't pardon us?

116
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,610
When you could take such a
huge step for me, Shakun...

117
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,950
- couldn't I...
- What do I matter? What have I got to lose?

118
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:36,670
But you... you have
your parents...

119
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:40,760
- your society, culture...
- I have you, Shakuntala, I've everything I need.

120
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:46,660
After the wedding, we'll write to mom and
dad for their blessings and forgiveness.

121
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,430
Why not write
before the wedding?

122
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,690
My father's an intemperate man...

123
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,910
he'll be furious when he hears.

124
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,640
I'll write to mother...

125
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,190
she'll persuade father somehow.

126
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:06,530
You don't realise, Shakuntala, every
mother longs for a bride for her son.

127
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:09,610
And you're the daughter-in-law
of my mother's dreams.

128
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:16,600
Really? Don't you have
any portrait of hers?

129
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,040
No. Why?

130
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:25,200
I've never seen her.
I long to see her.

131
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,920
My parents died
in my childhood, no?

132
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:37,240
I hoped, when I got married,
I would get parents too...

133
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:43,050
- but...
- It's late. Go to sleep.

134
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:56,740
My red scarf made of muslin...

135
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,460
Sir!

136
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,120
- Did you bring tea?
- Yes, sir.

137
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,370
- It's made well, isn't it?
- Well? Sir, it's two-in-one!

138
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,470
- What do you mean?
- It's light on top and strong underneath.

139
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:22,100
- Who asked you to make it light and strong?
- No one, sir. I made it that way.

140
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,480
You will drink the top portion
and the rest...

141
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,430
Listen, who was playing
the violin last night?

142
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,746
- Oh, that's 'Pagla babu' (mad gentleman).
- Pagla babu?

143
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:35,710
Actually, his name is Raja, but we
lovingly call him Pagla babu.

144
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:39,010
Sometimes he wanders around
singing, and if he's in good spirits...

145
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,810
then he plays the violin at night.
He's totally mad.

146
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:43,080
Capricious!

147
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,070
Shakuntala!

148
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,960
Shakuntala... get up,
it's morning.

149
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,710
It's good you woke me up...

150
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:08,600
- I was having a very bad dream.
- It's okay.

151
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:11,310
Wash your hands and face,
the tea is getting cold.

152
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:39,490
- Uncle! Uncle! - Where?
- I thought I saw him pass the gate.

153
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,060
You still haven't ceased
fearing your uncle.

154
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:58,450
You don't understand.
He'll definitely come.

155
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,090
He'll definitely come to know.

156
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,470
He'll definitely take me
away from you.

157
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:09,610
No one can take you away
from me, Shakuntala.

158
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,010
You're scaring yourself
unnecessarily.

159
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,910
I'm leaving, so you will
never again be frightened.

160
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,720
- Where are you going?
- To call the priest.

161
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:24,460
Don't be scared.
I'll be back soon.

162
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,820
Who's it?

163
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,200
My name is 'Munni's mother',
my dear...

164
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,356
I live in this locality,
in the chawl opposite.

165
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,590
Please come...

166
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:54,700
- Come... please come in.
- How can I? Please open this as well.

167
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:06,390
There isn't a person in this locality with
whom one can have a conversation.

168
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,010
When I saw you
arrive last night...

169
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:11,660
I was beside myself with joy.

170
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:16,430
Mother, you were saying who's this
who's come to trouble us?

171
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,460
Shut up, brat! I was talking about
someone else, and this little horror...

172
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:26,460
Please sit down. When I saw you
from up there, I said...

173
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:30,060
what good tenants have come to live
in Choudhury's house!

174
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,970
Mother, you said 'Where have these
starving beggars come from?'

175
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:37,230
- They don't even have...
- Will you be quiet or not?

176
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,360
Don't listen to her, my dear...

177
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:43,450
I was talking about
the previous tenants.

178
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:48,310
Dear god, how the locality was disgraced
when they moved in here.

179
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,740
A woman had eloped with a man.

180
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,880
- A woman? With a man?
- Yes!

181
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:58,740
We're simple folk.
We were married off...

182
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:02,860
to whoever our parents
foisted on us.

183
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,160
We're still here.

184
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,970
- Where's your 'him'?
- 'Him'?

185
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:14,080
- He's... uh... just gone out.
- What's his name?

186
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,760
- Ajay Sharma.
- And your name?

187
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:24,940
- Shakuntala Varma.
- Sharma and Varma?

188
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:29,340
- I understand.
- What did you understand?

189
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:33,260
Munni, go explore
that room. Go!

190
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,370
I didn't want to say this
in front of her...

191
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:42,700
As soon as I laid eyes on you both
last night, I'd my suspicions...

192
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:44,490
- Suspicion?
- Yes!

193
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,940
You had a love marriage,
didn't you?

194
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:58,360
- Ye-es.
- See? It's not so easy to fool me.

195
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,600
Mother...

196
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,560
Mother, there's no trust.
There's no trusting anyone.

197
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:08,050
- What don't you trust, my dear?
- Didn't you say, mother...

198
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:12,160
however bad they are, they will
serve us a cup of tea?

199
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:15,270
- There isn't even a stove in the kitchen.
- Forgive me, sister.

200
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,200
- We haven't yet...
- Hey, girl!

201
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,640
Don't take offence at
her words, my dear...

202
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:25,130
All my chores are waiting for me.
I'll come tomorrow if time permits.

203
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,120
Alright? Come, Munni.

204
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,280
- Mother!
- I'll show you!

205
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,240
Hey, brat, why are you
standing still? Come on!

206
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:55,400
[Priest chanting wedding prayers.]

207
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:53,490
- Wow!
- Did you like it?

208
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:59,050
- Hmm...
- Really? Do you like it?

209
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,640
Like it? I like it
very, very much.

210
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:05,710
Hmm... You approved of it
so easily?

211
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:11,670
I approved of it much earlier;
now, it's done wonders.

212
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,720
- What do you mean?
- I mean, I was already crazy about these large eyes...

213
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:22,500
- and now they're kohl-rimmed...
- Rubbish! Was I referring to myself?

214
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,280
Then who were you talking about?

215
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:29,470
I was asking whether
you liked the decor.

216
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:35,310
Home? When you're in front of me,
Shakun, I don't see anything else.

217
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,190
You know how to invoke magic.

218
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:42,570
Simply change your sari, and the whole
world changes color before my eyes.

219
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:44,710
Enough! Stop the poetry.

220
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,510
Look, what an interesting book
I found on the shelf.

221
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,660
Perhaps the previous tenant
left it here.

222
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:54,670
What a beautiful book it is!

223
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,080
We've been married
for three days...

224
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:00,390
- and it seems you already love a child more than you love your husband.
- Ajay!

225
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,490
You make a joke
of everything. Get up!

226
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,526
- Clean the shelves.
- Wait a minute, Shakuntala...

227
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,670
Why bother? I've
written to Father...

228
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,900
Very soon, he'll come
to take us with him.

229
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,870
Are you still hoping your parents
will come here?

230
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,820
If they were to come, wouldn't they
have replied to your letter?

231
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:26,760
But what's their fault?
I'm the unfortunate one...

232
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:32,850
Else, why would my parents
have died when I was a child?

233
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,590
A ray of hope had glimmered
during the wedding...

234
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:42,500
- but that too...
- Don't grieve, Shakuntala...

235
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,580
You've waited so long,
wait a few more days.

236
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:51,460
Litsen, please take me to them.

237
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,340
I'll fall at their feet
and beg forgiveness.

238
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,390
I'll tell them, "You have
so many servants...

239
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,850
please let me stay too."

240
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,830
No, Shakuntala. I won't be able
to bear it if they reject you.

241
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,490
I think we should wait a little.

242
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:43,850
Are you already dreaming
of a garden?

243
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:49,720
All my dreams were
being realized.

244
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,880
Only...

245
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:57,650
I'm sowing a seed; Daddu's mother
had given it to me.

246
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:00,720
She said, if I held it firmly
in my fist overnight...

247
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:05,550
and wished hard, it would be granted
when the seed sprouted.

248
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:10,410
These are only old wives' tales.
Humans live a long life...

249
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:14,270
they have many desires. Do you think
they can all be realized?

250
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,890
I had but a small desire...

251
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,590
that we could make
a home together.

252
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,870
Well, that desire is
fulfilled. I...

253
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:28,830
- You...
- Yes, and in making that home...

254
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:32,230
- we destroyed another.
- Shakuntala!

255
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:36,050
- Why do you always think of it that way?
- Look...

256
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:39,070
another day has passed
without a letter.

257
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,090
Be patient a few more days.

258
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Then we'll see what
fate has in store for us.

259
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:02,850
Keep on singing;
your time will also come one day...

260
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:21,250
The skies are raising their voice,
the world will also change...

261
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:24,790
Keep on singing...

262
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:28,290
Your time will
also come one day...

263
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,910
- Any letter?
- No.

264
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:51,340
- Any message?
- No.

265
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:55,710
- Not even a messenger with a note?
- If so, wouldn't I've told you?

266
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,340
Shakuntala!

267
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,740
I understand your
grief, Shakuntala...

268
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:09,930
If no one wants to support us, so be it.
We are there for each other.

269
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,740
We'll spend our lives like this,
sharing our joys and sorrows.

270
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:17,800
Okay? Come in.

271
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,940
No. I don't feel
like going inside...

272
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:26,530
- Shall we stay out here awhile?
- Of course.

273
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:38,070
Oil, vegetables, dry chilies...

274
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:41,200
- coal...
- Hey, listen, Shakuntala...

275
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:43,890
- isn't this all too much?
- What do you mean?

276
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,320
How can I equip a kitchen
without these?

277
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,670
Buy these from a good grocer's.

278
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,550
- Oh.
- I'd bought a few things from the shop opposite.

279
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:54,080
Look, it's all adulterated.

280
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,130
That's all very well,
Shakuntala, but...

281
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:00,650
I was thinking if we could
be patient, just for today...

282
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:04,040
What's the use of false hopes?

283
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:09,070
Am I any less grieved?
I, too, had thought...

284
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:13,620
that I could call
someone 'Mother'... but...

285
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:21,130
- Go. Get the provisions quickly.
- Alright.

286
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:26,770
Oh, listen. Today's a Friday. The landlord
may come to collect the rent.

287
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:29,830
- Please ask him to wait. Okay?
- Alright.

288
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:55,396
- Er... excuse me? Do you know where House no: 75/2 is?
- Yes, of course.

289
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,960
Hey, listen, for god's sake!
Listen...

290
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,830
You said you knew where
House no: 75/2 is, and yet...

291
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:08,290
But you didn't ask me to show you.
I don't talk unnecessarily.

292
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,510
- Tell us now, won't you?
- Here, in front of you.

293
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:16,390
Oh... so this is the house.

294
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:21,130
Forgive me, but are you
Nilambar Sharma by any chance?

295
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,780
- Yes, I'm Nilambar Sharma, but you...
- Didn't you recognize me?

296
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,410
I'm Mahadev. Mahadev Choudhury.

297
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:33,190
- We studied together at Presidency College.
- Oh. Mahadev!

298
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,840
It's been ages
since I last saw you.

299
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,920
And how do I recognize you?
You've become bald.

300
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:44,660
What do I say, my friend?
God only heard one of my prayers.

301
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,570
When our accountancy professor
caught my hair and pulled...

302
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:53,410
I used to pray, "Dear God, please
take away all my hair; let me be bald."

303
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,516
God listened to
my prayers only now.

304
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:02,460
Tell me about yourself. Do you still
have that passion for music or...

305
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:07,550
Now my days are spent listening
to devotional songs, my friend.

306
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:11,790
Those were the days, my friend, those
musical evenings on your hostel terrace...

307
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:15,150
You sang as beautifully
as you wrote.

308
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:18,030
Today's songs make me sick.

309
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,700
The melody matches the words!

310
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:21,830
'If there's a moon in the sky'

311
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:25,030
Tell me, if not the moon, would
there be traffic police in the sky?

312
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:29,840
Anyway, what are you doing here?
This is my house.

313
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:34,250
- Is Mr. Ajay a relative of yours?
- Ye-es... no!

314
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:40,400
This is my wife. And this is
Mahadev Choudhury, a college friend.

315
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:45,160
Namaste, bhabhi. Come, let's go in.
I've come here to collect the rent.

316
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:49,460
Ajay babu is a very nice man.
How are you related to him?

317
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,550
- I was related once. Not any more. Look, Mahadev...
- Yes?

318
00:29:55,660 --> 00:30:00,310
I would appreciate it if you
could collect the rent later.

319
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:04,030
- The matter is rather private.
- Oh, of course.

320
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,750
You attend to your business.
I'll return later.

321
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,910
And yes, you should definitely
bring bhabhi home...

322
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:16,290
eat something... My house? Go straight,
there's a dispensary to your left...

323
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:21,180
- to its right is a lane, and to the left...
- We'll come. We'll definitely come.

324
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:25,210
- Bhabhi, please do come. Namaste.
- Namaste.

325
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:30,630
Driver! Park the car
in the shade.

326
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:38,530
Please listen...

327
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,940
please reconsider.
He's our only son.

328
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,310
- If he's committed a mistake...
- Look...

329
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:48,770
I brought you here on condition
you wouldn't say anything.

330
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:52,980
And if you think my heart
is soft as wax...

331
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:56,720
then you don't know me
even after all these years.

332
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,990
I haven't come so far
to embrace him.

333
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,350
I've come to bid him good-bye.

334
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:05,760
I've come to tell him that
he's not my son any more.

335
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:14,500
Sing in praise of the Lord...

336
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:25,580
Oh, my heart...

337
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:31,870
Oh, my heart, sing
in praise of the Lord

338
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:50,520
Shower your affections on him

339
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:59,460
Oh, my heart, sing
in praise of the Lord

340
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:16,360
He, whose name Ahalya
chanted in a trance...

341
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:21,760
and crossed over the ocean
of wordly existence

342
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:45,030
Bow your head to him

343
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:49,550
Bow your head to him, my heart

344
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:53,930
Oh, my heart, sing
in praise of the Lord

345
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:16,886
Chanting his name
made Meera immortal

346
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:22,440
In doing so, Meera revealed
the glory of his name

347
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:42,430
Light a flame unto him

348
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:46,860
Light the flame unto him,
my heart

349
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:51,420
Oh, my heart, sing
in praise of the Lord

350
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:08,060
He will listen to
your woes some day

351
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:19,459
and alleviate your sorrows too

352
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:30,290
Don't tremble at this grief

353
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,890
Don't tremble at this grief,
my heart

354
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:39,410
Oh, my heart, sing
in praise of the Lord

355
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:53,060
Shower your affections on him

356
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:01,860
Oh, my heart, sing
in praise of the Lord

357
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:21,250
- Oh, you've arrived?
- Pardon?

358
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:23,960
He said you would
come to collect the rent.

359
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:28,410
He's gone to the market; he should
be back soon. Please come in.

360
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:32,140
- You?
- This is your...

361
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,430
My wife.

362
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:38,250
Oh. Please come, mother.
Please come in.

363
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,060
Mother?

364
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,900
You call me mother?

365
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,360
I lost my mother
when I was a child...

366
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:51,730
that's why this word has such...
look at my ill-fortune...

367
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:54,460
Even when I have the world,
I have nothing.

368
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,040
- What are you saying, my dear?
- Yes, mother...

369
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:03,430
He accepted me without
his parents' permission.

370
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:05,660
- That's why...
- Ajay...?

371
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:11,430
When will Ajay babu return? We've come
a great distance just to meet him.

372
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:15,990
Do you live so far away from us?
I didn't know that.

373
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:21,040
- He didn't tell me either.
- There are many things he hasn't told you.

374
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:26,950
- I'm feeling very thirsty, my dear.
- I'll get water, mother. Please come in.

375
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:34,270
What a wonderful daughter-in-law!
Please, forgive them?

376
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:37,040
I'll do just what I'd come
prepared to do.

377
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:42,640
If anyone is at fault, it's our son.
What has this poor girl done?

378
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:47,510
This is the way of the world. Someone
is at fault, someone else pays for it.

379
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:06,670
What's the matter, my dear?

380
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:12,360
You're the first guests we've had
since our wedding.

381
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:16,480
You stand in place of my mother,
you're like my father...

382
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:21,340
I'm such an idiot, I'm only
serving you water.

383
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,990
The water you serve tastes
like nectar, my dear.

384
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:31,140
Mother, do one thing... please
lunch here before you leave.

385
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,990
It will be late when
you reach home.

386
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:37,970
- That's fine.
- No, no. We didn't come here to eat.

387
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:43,070
I know you didn't
come here for a meal.

388
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:49,750
What can I serve you anyway?
Just a poor meal of odds and ends.

389
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:52,540
It's not a matter of quality.
We're in a hurry.

390
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,170
How long will it take?
Give me two minutes...

391
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,600
I said 'No'. Is this
obligatory?

392
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:03,700
- If you would deign to eat a little, it would bless my husband...
- No!

393
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:06,700
We have no time
to bless your husband!

394
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:16,090
Let me see how you will go
without eating... hungry...

395
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:20,080
- What? You'll force me to stay?
- Yes!

396
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,900
- What right do you have?
- Right?

397
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,690
Our new home,
my husband's welfare...

398
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,700
and you ask me, by what right?

399
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:30,380
I'll eat. If he doesn't
eat, so be it.

400
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:34,430
He doesn't know that it's considered
inauspicious to let a guest go hungry...

401
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:38,800
- for the home, for the husband...
- I said, we're not eating!

402
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:45,610
If this were your son's home, and
I were your daughter-in-law...

403
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:50,380
could you have behaved this way?
You do this, because...

404
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:53,410
because I'm another's daughter.

405
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:57,690
I have no parents, no siblings...
no one to call my own.

406
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,280
Oh, she's started to cry...
what's there to cry about?

407
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,580
- You tell me...
- You made her cry, and now...!

408
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:06,200
- Tell her you'll eat.
- Yes, yes, of course I'll eat.

409
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:10,500
Now tell her to stop crying.
You know I can't handle tears.

410
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,590
We'll definitely eat
if you insist.

411
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:15,710
Don't cry, don't cry!
I can't stand tears.

412
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:20,600
Don't cry, my dear, don't cry.

413
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:31,180
Okay, so you have never seen
your parents-in-law?

414
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:35,290
How could I have? I don't
even have their photograph.

415
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:39,250
I told my husband many times
to take me to them.

416
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:42,406
- But he wouldn't listen.
- He's an ass!

417
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:45,700
- Excuse me?
- Sorry. What does he say?

418
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:50,570
He says he couldn't bear it
if they were to insult me.

419
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,980
- Shameless wretch! Good-for-nothing!
- What did you say?

420
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:55,240
- Nothing at all.
- Did you call my husband names?

421
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:59,370
Names? No, no, I didn't
call your husband names.

422
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:02,690
That... that... I was berating
your father-in-law.

423
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,480
- Isn't he an idiot to reject such a good daughter-in-law?
- Don't insult him.

424
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:11,030
Whatever he is,
he's my father-in-law.

425
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,290
From his perspective,
he's right.

426
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:17,860
He must have had so many hopes,
so many dreams...

427
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,310
and my husband, without
informing them...

428
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:24,590
It's him.

429
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:35,670
You took such a long time.
They've been waiting for so long.

430
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:39,890
- Who's 'they'?
- The landlord and his wife. - Huh?

431
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:43,480
- But what's the wife doing here?
- Shh... they are having lunch.

432
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:46,590
- Oh, so you've begun your hosting already?
- Of course.

433
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:50,916
- I have. I'm leaving.
- Hey, take hold of this, please.

434
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:54,860
- No, you bring it.
- Uff! Just a minute, Choudhury saab, I'm coming.

435
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,580
And now I've forgotten half of what
I was supposed to buy.

436
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:01,320
I remembered three things,
mung, oil and wood.

437
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:05,400
- Father!
- Father?

438
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:10,500
Get out! Get out, you scoundrel!

439
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,520
I don't want to see your face!
You're not my son!

440
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,356
What do you think you're saying?
It's his house.

441
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,480
If someone has to leave, it's us.
Why should he go?

442
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,140
Yes, of course.
You're right.

443
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:25,990
Come, dear, let's go.

444
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:31,780
What happiness can a man
who grieves his parents offer you?

445
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:35,720
He's not responsible for
any of this. It's all my fault.

446
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:39,680
- Everything. All of it.
- Why are you crying, my dear?

447
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:42,160
- What right do you have to take her away?
- Right?

448
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:44,930
What right did he have
to marry her?

449
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:48,286
Is he even worthy of her?
Pearls before swine!

450
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:50,030
Look here, you can't
speak like that!

451
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:53,930
If you can't forgive your son, then you
can't say she's your daughter-in-law.

452
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,270
What? I can't claim her
as my daughter-in-law?

453
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:13,480
He's saved his skin. Fool!

454
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:18,170
What are you staring at, now?
Come on, pack your bags!

455
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,710
Mother!

456
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:29,640
Mother... I knew
you would come...

457
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:32,090
- and everything would be alright.
- I didn't do a thing.

458
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:35,100
This 'pearl necklace' is
responsible for everything.

459
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,380
Really? So you too think
I'm a monkey?

460
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:41,070
But, first, examine these pearls
to see if they are real or fake.

461
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:47,726
True. These pearls may be fake,
but this monkey is real, right?

462
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:50,430
Wow! Bravo, my dear!

463
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:53,460
What you said is
absolutely true, my dear!

464
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,080
This is why I always say
we are only travelers.

465
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:17,710
Here today, there tomorrow...
no one knows where they're next.

466
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:21,680
See here, your son,
and my wedding... [laughter]

467
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:24,280
What I mean is
it happened in my house.

468
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:28,560
- Of course. In a way, he's your son too.
- Of course. Why not?

469
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:30,120
And, Nilambar...

470
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:34,600
he had given me an advance
for 15 days' rent.

471
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:36,720
Give it to him as
a gift from me.

472
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:39,040
If I give it to him, perhaps...

473
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:42,830
And, bhabhi, don't forget to call me
when you hold the reception.

474
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:46,580
- I'll eat to my heart's content.
- Of course, brother.

475
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,890
But you have already
given us a lavish feast.

476
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:52,910
It's always thus, bhabhi.
Man proposes...

477
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:54,350
and God...

478
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:18,180
Why did you stop, Shakuntala?

479
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,080
I'll never forget this house.

480
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:25,080
It's here I met my parents.

481
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:27,880
Only your parents?
No one else?

482
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,760
Of course. Everything.

483
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:34,740
All my desires
have been fulfilled.

484
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,080
I'll never forget this house.

485
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:55,910
One traveler comes,
and another leaves

486
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:59,080
The world is but an inn

487
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:21,120
They come bearing a storm
of unique desires

488
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:28,170
These foolish souls bring
a baggage of a hundred years

489
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:48,846
and leave in a cloud of dust

490
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:52,720
One traveler comes
and another leaves

491
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:55,850
The world is but an inn

492
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:07,400
Ours is the voice of our hearts

493
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:11,230
As also its vision

494
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:28,160
In a moment, a stranger
turns into a friend

495
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:34,900
While love blossoms
within a few hours

496
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:38,896
Life is short but
the gains are many

497
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:42,710
One traveler comes
and another leaves

498
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,770
The world is but an inn

499
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,240
- Look, this house...
- Wow!

500
00:46:57,890 --> 00:47:00,050
Oh... you've already approved
of it from the outside?

501
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:05,210
Oh. You're seeing a 'To Let'
board after ages. Right?

502
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:09,560
Yes, indeed. How similar are the people
who live in these rented houses.

503
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:12,060
- One leaves, and another...
- Wow.

504
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:15,586
That's absolutely true, Madhav babu.
You stole the words from my lips.

505
00:47:15,610 --> 00:47:18,240
Thousands have come here,
hundreds have left.

506
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:20,050
Please come, see the house.

507
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:28,760
So you like the house?

508
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:31,810
Where do my likes and
dislikes come in, dear sir?

509
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:33,980
I've told you everything.

510
00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:36,220
It's a great tragedy,
Madhav babu.

511
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:39,180
Did your older son
die so suddenly?

512
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:44,170
What can I say?
It was my time to go...

513
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:48,530
but he died instead. So, now,
what does anything matter?

514
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:51,530
I grieve for my
young daughter-in-law.

515
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:54,500
As if this trauma
weren't enough...

516
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,280
- she's pregnant as well.
- Oh Lord.

517
00:47:58,450 --> 00:48:02,330
She was going to commit suicide.
If it were only one trouble...

518
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,460
She can claim his pension.

519
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:08,080
My older son's income was
enough to feed the household.

520
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:12,210
Now, the younger one's plight
is enough to make me worry.

521
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,450
All our hopes are pinned on him.

522
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:18,390
He's given his examination.
Now, he has to pass them...

523
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:22,760
and get a job. And when my
daughter-in-law gives birth...

524
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:27,160
- then perhaps we might forget our sorrows...
- Absolutely!

525
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:32,040
Be optimistic, Madhav babu,
your troubles will surely end.

526
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,740
It doesn't take long for
fortunes to change, my friend.

527
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:37,160
It's that hope that's keeping me
alive, Mr. Mahadev.

528
00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:41,700
- So, you folks would like to move in this evening itself, right?
- Yes.

529
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:47,300
Here's one month's rent
in advance.

530
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:52,290
What's the hurry, Madhav babu?
You could have paid me later.

531
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:56,700
I'm not hungry for men.
I mean, I'm not greedy.

532
00:48:57,550 --> 00:49:01,390
- Here are the keys.
- Thank you. Now give me leave. Namaste.

533
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:09,140
We are lonely even though
we are together

534
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:13,040
It doesn't matter
what the world says

535
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:26,720
Bring it here.

536
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:31,030
- Has everything arrived?
- Yes, father.

537
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:32,880
- Where's bhabhi?
- She's inside.

538
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:36,730
Look, son, this is
a strange place...

539
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:39,840
keep your sister-in-law engrossed.
And listen...

540
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:42,250
don't let her out of your sight.

541
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:46,430
God forbid she
tries anything again.

542
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:50,080
- Don't worry, father. Please get our things unloaded.
- Alright.

543
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:06,700
- Bhabhi, why are you sitting in the dark?
- No particular reason.

544
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:10,060
- It feels nice.
- It's nice, isn't it?

545
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:12,510
There's the house
and a compound...

546
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:14,750
fewer walls, and more windows.

547
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:17,610
There's quite a bit of light,
and an owl to cry out at night.

548
00:50:18,490 --> 00:50:22,100
- Tell me, bhabhi, it's better than our previous house, isn't it?
- No.

549
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:27,940
How can I forget
that house, Bhanu?

550
00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:31,880
When I'd a deep connection
to every brick and stone?

551
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:34,160
Why're you thinking
of that, bhabhi?

552
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:38,140
If you live here, perhaps you will
be unable to forget this, too.

553
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,840
We will have to leave here
some day, after all.

554
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:44,590
Also... my exam results will be
published day after tomorrow.

555
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:49,620
I'll get a job if I pass;
if not, I'll be a laborer.

556
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:52,580
And, your results will also
be out by then, bhabhi.

557
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:55,980
- My results?
- Yes, bhabhi. A son will be born, right?

558
00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:00,996
Have our things arrived?
And where will we sleep?

559
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:05,250
Why? I'll sleep here; you sleep
over there, and father? In that room.

560
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:10,140
But, bhabhi, keep the door open.
I'm frightened.

561
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,620
Frightened? Of whom?

562
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,150
- Er... uh...
- I totally understand, Bhanu.

563
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:22,590
Don't worry about me
I won't die so soon.

564
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:26,000
I have to live...

565
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:30,380
for the sake of this enemy
growing within me.

566
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:28,470
What's this, bhabhi?
You're crying?

567
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:33,400
I wonder what I'm living for...

568
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:36,660
- when he's gone.
- Shame, bhabhi...

569
00:52:37,630 --> 00:52:39,420
you're enveloped
in your own grief?

570
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,060
Look at me, look at father...

571
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:45,940
who had to face
this tragedy at his age.

572
00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:49,660
Besides which, he worries about you,
and about our finances.

573
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:54,040
If you lose heart like this,
what will happen to us?

574
00:52:54,750 --> 00:52:59,170
I understand, Bhanu, but
I can't control myself.

575
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:02,220
Sometimes, I feel I'll go mad.

576
00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:09,580
Come, bhabhi, it's very late.
Go to sleep.

577
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:17,830
My heart's beating,
As Spring spreads its splendor

578
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:22,410
Come, my beloved,
I'm waiting for you

579
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:29,880
- Sir!
- Who's it?

580
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:43,380
- What sort of tea is this? It smells of grass.
- Grass?

581
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:47,180
Oh, I get it. He mistakenly
sent you coffee.

582
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:50,930
- Our tea never smells of grass.
- Then, of what does it smell?

583
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:53,266
- Of kerosene - Huh?
- It smells of paraffin.

584
00:53:53,290 --> 00:53:56,610
- Give it here, I'll get another.
- No, no. I prefer the smell of grass to paraffin.

585
00:53:56,850 --> 00:53:58,050
- Okay.
- Listen...

586
00:53:58,710 --> 00:54:02,286
- Who plays the violin at night?
- Violin? Oh, it's Pagla babu.

587
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:04,210
Do call him then.
He can play for us.

588
00:54:04,270 --> 00:54:08,410
Oh, god! Even if you pay him
Rs1,00,000, he will not agree.

589
00:54:08,730 --> 00:54:13,220
- But he'll play one great melody after the other when he feels like it.
- Really?

590
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:19,490
- Here, bhabhi, drink your tea.
- Where did this come from?

591
00:54:19,930 --> 00:54:22,570
Why question the source?
Drink your tea.

592
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:27,580
- Bhanu! - Hmm?
- May I show you something? - Sure.

593
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:32,650
- What a lovely book. Perhaps the previous tenants left it behind.
- Yes.

594
00:54:33,130 --> 00:54:36,450
- What a pretty child. Right?
- Ha! This is just a picture.

595
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:38,576
Your baby will be real
and even more beautiful.

596
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,750
Tch! Don't talk of that
inauspicious one.

597
00:54:40,870 --> 00:54:42,380
Don't insult my nephew!

598
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,310
He'll come into this world,
tell us the word of God...

599
00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:48,530
and we'll teach him
the language of men.

600
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:51,520
Then he'll call me 'tha-tha',
and I'll say, 'aa-ta' (coming)...

601
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:55,310
and then he'll grow up,
stumbling over common words.

602
00:54:55,530 --> 00:54:58,620
And then he'll scold us,
teach us anew...

603
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:02,300
by which time, we'll be old and gray.
Isn't that so, bhabhi?

604
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:06,650
Alright, alright. My tea's going cold
listening to your imaginings.

605
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:13,910
Chunnu Munnu! Ha!

606
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:20,200
'Munna is lovable;
he's mummy's pet.' Bhabhi!

607
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:23,360
- Listen to the poem I found.
- This is no time to listen to poetry.

608
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:25,870
- Look at how much is left to be done.
- And this is not work?

609
00:55:25,970 --> 00:55:28,280
You think poets don't work?
Come here.

610
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:31,980
- Let me go, Bhanu; I've so much to do.
- No. First, sit and listen to my poem.

611
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:34,970
Ha! The title of the poem
is 'Munna' (Son).

612
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:38,670
Imagine, your son,
I mean, my nephew...

613
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:41,850
his name is 'Munna' and you're
his mother. Now listen...

614
00:55:52,990 --> 00:55:56,980
Munna is so lovable,
he's his mother's darling

615
00:56:02,330 --> 00:56:06,670
Some call him the moon,
some say he's the apple of your eye

616
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:14,690
He looks good when he laughs,
and he looks good when he cries

617
00:56:14,930 --> 00:56:19,080
Nothing appeals to us
without his presence

618
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:31,820
May you live long, my dear

619
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:35,840
May my life be added to yours,
may you live long, my dear

620
00:56:36,330 --> 00:56:40,440
Munna is so lovable,
he's his mother's darling

621
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:49,290
Some call him the moon,
some say he's the apple of your eye

622
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:09,380
He asked his mother one day
'Why do you blow into the embers?'

623
00:57:16,070 --> 00:57:20,000
Why don't we plant a bread tree?

624
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:24,300
And pluck the bread like mangoes,
so we can eat them

625
00:57:34,930 --> 00:57:38,430
Why do you trouble
yourself daily?

626
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:42,290
His mother began to laugh,
and laughing, replied

627
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:46,480
Where can you make bread
without working hard for it?

628
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:50,350
May you live long, my dear

629
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:54,380
May you live long,
live long, my dear

630
00:57:54,870 --> 00:57:58,670
Munna is so lovable,
he's his mother's darling

631
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:07,100
Some call him the moon,
some say he's the apple of your eye

632
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:22,190
One day, Munna hid himself
so well, he couldn't be found

633
00:58:28,570 --> 00:58:32,850
Under the bed, behind the chairs

634
00:58:32,930 --> 00:58:37,050
They searched every corner,
until they gasped for breath

635
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:50,930
Where did he go? And how?
Everyone was troubled

636
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:54,960
They tired themselves searching,
but Munna was nowhere to be found

637
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:59,100
And when they found him, it was
in his loving mother's eyes

638
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:11,040
May you live long, my dear

639
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:15,160
May my life be added to yours,
may you live long, my dear

640
00:59:15,590 --> 00:59:19,290
Munna is so lovable,
he's his mother's pet

641
00:59:24,290 --> 00:59:28,190
Some call him the moon,
some say he's the apple of your eye

642
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:42,880
When the melody laughs,
the western skies turn crimson

643
00:59:42,970 --> 00:59:47,080
Mother carries Munna
over to the threshold

644
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:53,700
Father must be coming home,
bringing sweets for Munna

645
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:26,090
My dear, when did Bhanu say
he would come home with the results?

646
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:28,570
- By 3 o'clock, father.
- It's past 4 already.

647
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:31,850
Don't be worried.
He'll definitely pass.

648
01:00:33,170 --> 01:00:37,660
No, my dear. These days,
we're going through a bad time.

649
01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:41,780
What if he fails
due to my ill-deeds?

650
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,570
- Speak of good things, father.
- What do I say, my dear?

651
01:00:47,170 --> 01:00:49,420
I'm troubled by strange fears.

652
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:53,660
I can't bear life's burdens
alone any more.

653
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:58,950
If only he passes his exams,
and gets a job somewhere...

654
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:02,420
He's here, father!

655
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:13,850
- You are?
- My name is 'Munni's mother', my dear.

656
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:15,850
I live in this neighborhood.

657
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:18,480
- In the chawl opposite.
- Please come in.

658
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:20,100
Open this door too.

659
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:27,150
I used to be slender, as delicate
as a flower, once.

660
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:30,620
Those days, you didn't need to
open the door for me.

661
01:01:32,050 --> 01:01:36,680
Sit down, won't you? When I saw
you folks arrive yesterday...

662
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:39,690
I was beside myself with joy.

663
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:42,720
I told Munni, 'Look, Munni...

664
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:45,130
what nice people have
come to Choudhury's...

665
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:47,790
You keep quiet! Yes...

666
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:50,800
the previous tenants?

667
01:01:51,310 --> 01:01:55,900
My god! First, a woman had
run away with a man...

668
01:01:56,180 --> 01:01:59,840
and then, a man eloped with a woman.
Don't you dare say a word!

669
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:03,670
- Ma, I didn't say a word!
- Have you started babbling again?

670
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:08,480
Oh, yes, where's your husband?

671
01:02:10,010 --> 01:02:11,110
Husband?

672
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:18,580
My god! I knew it!

673
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:21,590
Munni, you go,
take a look inside.

674
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:28,190
You seem pregnant?

675
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:32,020
- Yes.
- How far along are you?

676
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:36,750
- Seven months.
- When did your husband die?

677
01:02:37,950 --> 01:02:40,930
- Three.
- My god!

678
01:02:41,490 --> 01:02:43,700
This world is full of tragedy.

679
01:02:44,620 --> 01:02:46,880
But you don't worry
about this child.

680
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:49,830
I'll give you such a surprise...

681
01:02:50,270 --> 01:02:53,490
Mother! Mother, you can
trust these people.

682
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:56,370
- What do you mean, trust?
- Mother, this kitchen has a stove.

683
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:59,480
- Stove?
- Bhabhi!

684
01:03:00,790 --> 01:03:03,536
Bhabhi! Bhabi, I've
cleared my exams, bhabhi!

685
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:06,790
Bhabhi, I've cleared...
I've cleared my exams!

686
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:12,140
- You are?
- She's our neighbor.

687
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:16,380
- Munni's mother.
- You seem older than me, so please accept my greetings.

688
01:03:19,010 --> 01:03:21,260
- Bhanu!
- I cleared my exams, father.

689
01:03:22,330 --> 01:03:25,010
Well done, my son.
Bless you.

690
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:29,070
Son, we have only reached
our first goal.

691
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:33,780
Now, if you would only get a job
somewhere, all our sorrows will vanish.

692
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:37,470
Bhabhi, you will have to
serve me a feast today.

693
01:03:37,630 --> 01:03:40,216
- And that too, to my heart's content.
- Tell me, what will you have?

694
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:43,190
Okay, so first make me lentils,
complete with raisins.

695
01:03:43,370 --> 01:03:44,570
And... and...

696
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:47,556
When I got my results, I remembered
everything. Now, I've forgotten it all.

697
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:52,050
Ah, yes, kheer, kachori,
halwa, puri, and...

698
01:03:52,570 --> 01:03:55,670
- Dahi bade? [lentil balls in yogurt]
- Yes, dahi bade. Bhabhi, dahi bade.

699
01:03:56,380 --> 01:03:58,280
- Wow, you're amazing.
Bhabhi...

700
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:00,470
send along a few
dahi bade for her.

701
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:03,880
A few? What are we to do
with a few? Send a lot.

702
01:04:10,470 --> 01:04:13,700
Wow, Bhabhi, wow. These
dahi bade are excellent. Wow!

703
01:04:16,030 --> 01:04:19,730
Give me two-three puris
and a few more dahi bade.

704
01:04:32,170 --> 01:04:36,610
Wow, wow... Oh, my...
oh, my god!

705
01:04:37,110 --> 01:04:40,150
- Bhabhi, when will the doctor come?
- Be patient.

706
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:43,590
- Father has gone to get him.
- I overate to please you...

707
01:04:44,370 --> 01:04:46,880
It seems like my stomach
is warring with itself.

708
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:50,916
- If this is what happens when I eat good food...
- Shall I massage your abdomen?

709
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:53,810
No... no, if you touch me,
the third World War will begin.

710
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:56,990
I'm dead, bhabhi...
hey, when will the doctor die?

711
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:59,200
- I've arrived.
- Aah... ooh...

712
01:05:01,790 --> 01:05:03,200
Doctor, I'm dead!

713
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:11,870
- Show me your tongue.
- Once more. Again.

714
01:05:12,790 --> 01:05:15,200
- More...
- Why don't you pull it?

715
01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:20,910
- What has he eaten today?
- He ate a lot to celebrate his exam results.

716
01:05:21,370 --> 01:05:23,980
- There were a lot of spices and ghee in the food.
- Ghee?

717
01:05:24,050 --> 01:05:25,850
- Yes.
- Where did you buy the ghee from?

718
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:28,620
- From the store opposite.
- Damn!

719
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:31,960
These days, everything
is adulterated.

720
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:34,590
I'm surprised he's still alive.

721
01:05:34,650 --> 01:05:37,710
- What?
- It's a blessing that he hasn't died yet.

722
01:05:37,870 --> 01:05:39,530
Please beware of
adulterated goods.

723
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:41,540
So, doctor, any medicines?

724
01:05:41,610 --> 01:05:44,300
What use are medicines?
Even they are adulterated today.

725
01:05:45,190 --> 01:05:47,920
Just warm some oil and
massage his abdomen.

726
01:05:48,190 --> 01:05:51,970
If the oil isn't adulterated, he'll be
at ease in half an hour.

727
01:05:52,190 --> 01:05:55,490
- Alright, let me take your leave.
- Yes, doctor, here's your fees.

728
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:56,960
Excuse me.

729
01:06:02,110 --> 01:06:05,010
- Where are you going, bhabhi?
- To heat up some oil. - No, no.

730
01:06:05,190 --> 01:06:06,990
- Please, sit here.
- The doctor said...

731
01:06:07,030 --> 01:06:10,150
No, Bhabhi. I think
the doctor is also a quack.

732
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:13,280
I'll never eat ghee again...

733
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:33,250
The whole world is tipsily
turning away from us

734
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:42,200
Look, they all left
evading our gaze

735
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:50,950
I wonder why the world
is ignoring us

736
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:59,900
The whole world is tipsily
turning away from us

737
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:29,170
On the streets galore are...

738
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:34,500
many admirers of beauty

739
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:56,460
We searched till we tired, but
we found no beloved

740
01:08:01,460 --> 01:08:05,550
The whole world bargains
and negotiates their love

741
01:08:10,090 --> 01:08:14,410
The whole world is tipsily
turning away from us

742
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:50,510
A honeyed tongue,
and a hand ready to strike

743
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:13,650
What a rotten trick to play,
my friend

744
01:09:18,390 --> 01:09:22,540
Why does the whole world
play such tricks on us?

745
01:09:26,870 --> 01:09:31,240
The whole world is tipsily
turning away from us

746
01:09:57,570 --> 01:10:04,580
My lord, whereabouts can
breath reside?

747
01:10:23,740 --> 01:10:27,880
We came yesterday, we have to
leave tomorrow, my lord

748
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:36,740
Why would the world
work for us today?

749
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:45,170
The whole world is tipsily
turning away from us

750
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:57,630
Look, they all left
evading our gaze

751
01:10:57,950 --> 01:11:01,870
I wonder why the whole world
is ignoring us

752
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:06,930
The whole world is tipsily
turning away from us

753
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:26,160
Here. Doesn't all this
jumping around trouble you?

754
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:29,700
It's not 'jumping around', sir.
It's called dance.

755
01:11:30,170 --> 01:11:32,240
When it troubles me
a lot, then...

756
01:11:33,670 --> 01:11:37,320
- Hey, you're not lame?
- No. - Oh, my god!

757
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:41,870
- So there's adulteration here too?
- Not adulteration, sir, transformation.

758
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:44,210
It's the age of adulteration
and transformation.

759
01:11:45,210 --> 01:11:47,670
Does anyone sympathise
with a hungry man, sir?

760
01:11:48,490 --> 01:11:51,710
When you aren't born lame,
you have to turn lame yourself.

761
01:11:52,250 --> 01:11:56,320
- Come. - Eh? Oh. I take your leave, sir.
- Alright.

762
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:05,820
Bhanu...

763
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:11,480
- What's it, bhabhi?
- Here, take this lemonade.

764
01:12:11,890 --> 01:12:14,130
Lemonade? Why are you
teasing me, bhabhi?

765
01:12:14,270 --> 01:12:16,260
Can anyone stay alive
on lemonade?

766
01:12:16,390 --> 01:12:18,270
Why? Have you forgotten
what happened yesterday?

767
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,540
Should I serve you
pulao instead?

768
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:22,450
Which idiot will demand pulao?

769
01:12:22,990 --> 01:12:26,840
- If I could have yesterday's dahi-bade...
- Shameless wretch! After yesterday?

770
01:12:27,210 --> 01:12:29,720
- You've grown up but you still remain...
- A donkey!

771
01:12:31,410 --> 01:12:33,256
Father has arrived.
I'm going to tell him...

772
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:35,840
No, no, bhabhi. Don't tell father.
I'll fall at your feet.

773
01:12:36,110 --> 01:12:38,710
- What's the matter, my dear?
- It's nothing, father.

774
01:12:39,170 --> 01:12:41,946
Bhanu... was asking
for lemonade.

775
01:12:41,970 --> 01:12:44,670
- So give it to him. Lemonade is good.
- Isn't it, father?

776
01:12:44,890 --> 01:12:48,010
I'm tired of asking.
Lemons can cure all illnesses.

777
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:49,750
It settles the stomach.

778
01:12:49,970 --> 01:12:52,360
Then it doesn't matter if
one eats pulao or dahi-bade.

779
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:55,660
I mean, after one gets well.
It's medicine, and...

780
01:12:56,820 --> 01:13:00,760
- and tasty as well.
- Here's your medicine, my dear.

781
01:13:02,170 --> 01:13:03,270
Father...

782
01:13:04,470 --> 01:13:06,470
why do you buy such
expensive medicine?

783
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:09,810
I'm a mere woman.

784
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:12,740
- To spend so much on me...
- Don't say that, my dear.

785
01:13:13,950 --> 01:13:15,870
Can't we at least do
this much for you?

786
01:13:16,620 --> 01:13:18,360
You're the daughter-in-law
of the house.

787
01:13:19,540 --> 01:13:21,230
Now, we depend on you.

788
01:13:24,510 --> 01:13:25,710
Listen, son...

789
01:13:26,850 --> 01:13:30,760
your sister-in-law is right.
She knows the truth.

790
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:35,010
Even a well runs dry if
it's not replenished.

791
01:13:35,860 --> 01:13:41,110
If our expenses continue, we can stretch
our funds for another two months.

792
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:45,960
And then... and then,
the future looks bleak.

793
01:13:47,190 --> 01:13:48,990
We won't be able to
afford medicines.

794
01:13:50,130 --> 01:13:52,470
Now if you could somehow
get a job, then...

795
01:13:52,930 --> 01:13:56,370
Don't worry, father. I'll get
one job or the other.

796
01:13:56,660 --> 01:13:59,580
I've applied to so many jobs. Won't I
get at least one in two months?

797
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:01,920
I hope so, son.

798
01:14:02,850 --> 01:14:06,470
It's that hope
that keeps us alive.

799
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:34,160
- What happened, Bhanu?
- Bhabhi!

800
01:14:36,170 --> 01:14:39,210
You tell me what to do. I feel
embarassed to ask father.

801
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:41,640
- What are you embarrassed about?
- Do you not remember?

802
01:14:41,870 --> 01:14:43,580
I've to go for a
pre-employment test.

803
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:47,860
- So shall I ask father to take the test instead?
- Stop teasing, bhabhi.

804
01:14:48,050 --> 01:14:51,060
Don't I need bus fare?
How do I ask father?

805
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:52,830
You know his situation.

806
01:14:54,190 --> 01:14:56,490
Bhanu, I have some money put by.

807
01:14:56,710 --> 01:15:00,290
- You do?
- Yes. But you'll have to repay me once you get a job.

808
01:15:00,650 --> 01:15:03,300
Of course, bhabhi, with interest,
and interest upon interest.

809
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:05,260
But where did you
get this money?

810
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:18,540
Your brother and I had
scrimped and saved.

811
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:27,240
He'd a great desire to get a red
woollen suit made for the baby.

812
01:15:27,990 --> 01:15:30,700
We will certainly fulfil
my brother's desire, bhabhi.

813
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:33,330
I'm sure I'll ace this test...

814
01:15:33,530 --> 01:15:36,030
and that I'll get a job
within two months.

815
01:15:36,430 --> 01:15:38,420
It's this hope that
keeps us going, Bhanu.

816
01:15:40,740 --> 01:15:44,100
- Here.
- Okay, bhabhi.

817
01:15:46,540 --> 01:15:49,390
I'll take father's blessing as well.
It's no big deal.

818
01:16:23,190 --> 01:16:24,690
What will happen now, Bhanu?

819
01:16:26,310 --> 01:16:28,510
I didn't know the world
could be so heartless.

820
01:16:29,620 --> 01:16:31,820
Two months went by, and
I couldn't get even one job?

821
01:16:33,140 --> 01:16:36,760
Forget earning any money,
I emptied your savings instead.

822
01:16:37,090 --> 01:16:40,650
It doesn't matter. Remember that
pre-employment test you took?

823
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:44,430
- What happened?
- If anything had to happen, wouldn't it have by now?

824
01:16:44,820 --> 01:16:48,110
Wouldn't I've got a letter?
I should have joined tomorrow.

825
01:16:48,650 --> 01:16:51,390
Anyway... forget about tomorrow.

826
01:16:52,190 --> 01:16:56,400
What will happen today? I need
bus fare to go to the interview.

827
01:16:57,150 --> 01:16:59,070
How do I ask father?

828
01:16:59,930 --> 01:17:03,590
- Shall I ask father?
- No, bhabhi, why should you ask?

829
01:17:04,110 --> 01:17:05,410
I'll go myself.

830
01:17:06,350 --> 01:17:09,290
If I can get the bus fare
one way...

831
01:17:09,860 --> 01:17:11,380
I'll walk back home.

832
01:17:16,190 --> 01:17:17,290
Father...

833
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:20,880
Chand Factory has
called me for a job today.

834
01:17:21,940 --> 01:17:23,670
But I've to reach there
before 10 a.m.

835
01:17:24,700 --> 01:17:26,350
Then go. It's getting late.

836
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:30,100
Whether you get the job or not,
you should keep trying.

837
01:17:31,140 --> 01:17:33,520
But... but... I was saying...

838
01:17:33,870 --> 01:17:36,430
What were you saying?
You didn't say anything.

839
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:40,440
- The fact is... to go by bus...
- Oh.

840
01:17:41,670 --> 01:17:44,070
Where did you get the money
to roam around all these days?

841
01:17:44,350 --> 01:17:46,196
- Bhabhi gave it to me.
- Bahu? (Daughter-in-law)

842
01:17:46,220 --> 01:17:49,890
- Where did she get it from?
- She'd saved some... - And you spent it.

843
01:17:50,370 --> 01:17:53,810
Wow! Weren't you ashamed of taking
her money instead of giving her some?

844
01:17:53,980 --> 01:17:57,060
- Why didn't you die?
- I'll repay her as soon as I get a job, father.

845
01:17:57,320 --> 01:18:00,260
Hmph! Where there's no will,
there's no way.

846
01:18:01,150 --> 01:18:02,250
Here!

847
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:06,920
- I'll get a job tod...
- Alright, alright. Go now. It's getting late!

848
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:12,580
Useless wretch!

849
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:20,140
Bhanu, don't be offended
by father's words.

850
01:18:20,740 --> 01:18:24,270
Why would I be offended?
Don't I know father's situation?

851
01:18:25,350 --> 01:18:29,030
- Okay...
- Wait! You haven't eaten anything.

852
01:18:29,220 --> 01:18:32,360
It doesn't matter. I won't die
because I didn't eat one meal.

853
01:18:32,510 --> 01:18:37,110
Listen, I strongly feel you will get
that first job you applied for.

854
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:39,920
No, bhabi. I don't think so.

855
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:43,450
- I told you, today is the last day.
- So what?

856
01:18:43,910 --> 01:18:46,900
- You could get a letter today.
- Yes, I could...

857
01:18:47,220 --> 01:18:48,560
but I won't.

858
01:18:49,390 --> 01:18:50,920
So forget about the letter.

859
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:54,110
Perhaps I'll return
with good news.

860
01:19:13,460 --> 01:19:19,270
The skies are raising their voice,
the world will also change

861
01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:22,720
Keep on singing...

862
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:52,650
- Here, sir. - Yes, do write it down, father.
- Yes.

863
01:19:56,180 --> 01:19:59,250
- 3 shirts. - 3 shirts.
- Please check the pockets.

864
01:20:01,540 --> 01:20:05,600
- 2 dhotis.
- 2 dhotis.

865
01:20:07,010 --> 01:20:08,880
- One pair of trousers.
- Hmm..

866
01:20:11,690 --> 01:20:16,030
- And 3 handkerchiefs.
- I found a ticket inside a pocket, sir. Take a look.

867
01:20:20,710 --> 01:20:22,120
A cinema ticket?

868
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:49,580
- Any luck, Bhanu?
- No.

869
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:53,330
- No hope at all?
- No.

870
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:57,960
- Any letter... - No, no, no!
- Bhanu!

871
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:01,300
Forgive me, bhabhi.

872
01:21:02,180 --> 01:21:06,530
I feel like... I'm totally useless.
Good-for-nothing!

873
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:11,420
I'll never amount to anything
in this world.

874
01:21:12,370 --> 01:21:15,740
I was a burden upon you,
I'm a burden, I'll always be one.

875
01:21:16,070 --> 01:21:19,110
Don't say such things, Bhanu.
Come inside.

876
01:21:21,180 --> 01:21:23,840
Freshen up. I'll
get you some food.

877
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:39,570
Which play did our lord
see today?

878
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:42,910
- Play?
- Yes, play, film...

879
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,620
Which heroine's film did you see,
my darling?

880
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:48,180
I don't understand
what you're saying.

881
01:21:48,220 --> 01:21:50,700
Of course you understand.
Say you don't feel any shame!

882
01:21:51,110 --> 01:21:54,250
You cheat your old father
and widowed sister-in-law...

883
01:21:54,460 --> 01:21:55,990
and enjoy yourself
watching films.

884
01:21:56,330 --> 01:21:58,380
- Are you man or beast?
- But, father...

885
01:21:58,830 --> 01:22:02,700
- that was a friend...
- I see. Now you've begun to lie too.

886
01:22:02,790 --> 01:22:06,620
- I swear upon God...
- Silence! Don't utter the name of God.

887
01:22:06,740 --> 01:22:09,740
Go drown youself. If you have
any shame, ingest poison.

888
01:22:10,060 --> 01:22:14,970
The doctor was right. Everything
is adulterated, including men!

889
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:17,900
- Or else, for a simple job...
- I tried, father.

890
01:22:18,290 --> 01:22:20,390
How is it my fault
if I don't get a job?

891
01:22:20,430 --> 01:22:23,310
Fault? Being born was
your biggest fault.

892
01:22:23,820 --> 01:22:25,720
Could you rectify that fault
by dying?

893
01:22:25,770 --> 01:22:27,730
No. Where do you
have the courage?

894
01:22:28,050 --> 01:22:30,020
Because you're not human.
You're adulterated.

895
01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:32,610
- Father, don't insult me so.
- What did you say?

896
01:22:32,690 --> 01:22:36,220
Fraud! Scroundel!
Get lost! Get out!

897
01:22:36,610 --> 01:22:38,360
- Henceforth, you aren't my son!
- Father!

898
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:41,290
I'll assume both my sons died,
not just one of them.

899
01:22:42,870 --> 01:22:46,100
Bhanu... Bhanu...
Bhanu!

900
01:22:46,870 --> 01:22:50,350
He went away, father.
Stop him, please, stop him.

901
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:54,350
Let the wretch go. Where will he go?
He'll return, tail between his legs.

902
01:24:56,250 --> 01:25:00,830
Father, I don't have
any right to be alive.

903
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:06,930
If I've a prayer, it's that
I'm re-born as your son...

904
01:25:08,270 --> 01:25:10,530
so that I may serve you
and bhabhi.

905
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:13,120
Your unfortunate Bhanu.

906
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:00,500
Telegram!

907
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:09,720
- There's a telegram. No. 4.
- Who's is it, my dear?

908
01:27:13,130 --> 01:27:14,800
Who is it from, my dear?

909
01:27:16,340 --> 01:27:20,106
Father... Father,
Bhanu has got a job.

910
01:27:20,130 --> 01:27:22,496
- A job?
- Yes, and he has to join today itself.

911
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:24,510
Give me my spectacles...
where are they?

912
01:27:35,290 --> 01:27:40,020
Dear God, I'm so grateful.
You have heard my prayers.

913
01:27:41,390 --> 01:27:42,590
My dear!

914
01:27:43,910 --> 01:27:46,780
What happened, my dear?
Why aren't you saying anything?

915
01:27:52,550 --> 01:27:53,950
Bhanu!

916
01:27:55,470 --> 01:27:58,160
What have you done, Bhanu?

917
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:06,810
What have you done, Bhanu?
What have you done?

918
01:28:08,780 --> 01:28:13,100
Bhanu, you didn't understand
my grief, Bhanu...

919
01:28:15,610 --> 01:28:21,400
Bhanu, you didn't understand
my grief, Bhanu.

920
01:28:24,670 --> 01:28:26,950
- Bhanu... you...
- Father?

921
01:28:27,460 --> 01:28:30,950
- Why are you crying?
- You... suicide...

922
01:28:31,620 --> 01:28:32,940
- Suicide?
- Uh-uh.

923
01:28:38,500 --> 01:28:41,710
- Bhanu!
- Oh, you were playing tricks on me.

924
01:28:41,770 --> 01:28:44,346
- Father! - You were playing with my emotions.
- Baba, please listen...

925
01:28:44,370 --> 01:28:47,546
Listen to what? You tried to trick us,
threaten us, what was the idea?

926
01:28:47,570 --> 01:28:49,550
Let me speak!
I did drink poison!

927
01:28:49,660 --> 01:28:51,060
What? You drank poison?

928
01:28:51,110 --> 01:28:54,820
Yes! But little did I know the
poison was also adulterated.

929
01:28:55,250 --> 01:28:57,700
- Again! Jokes again! Bhanu, joking again?
- Father!

930
01:28:58,410 --> 01:28:59,810
Please don't scold him.

931
01:29:00,510 --> 01:29:03,830
Bhanu, let me give you
some good news today.

932
01:29:04,670 --> 01:29:07,350
Remember that job for which
you'd to give a test? Well, you got it!

933
01:29:07,460 --> 01:29:10,300
- Huh?
- Yes. They had sent a telegram.

934
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:13,990
- Bhabhi, this news isn't adulterated, is it?
- Not at all, Bhanu.

935
01:29:14,410 --> 01:29:17,590
- You have to join today.
- Father, I got a job!

936
01:29:17,910 --> 01:29:21,780
I got a job, father! I got a job,
I got a job, father!

937
01:29:25,450 --> 01:29:27,140
What happened, my dear?

938
01:29:29,390 --> 01:29:32,666
Son, stay with her. I'll get
the doctor. You stay here.

939
01:29:32,690 --> 01:29:34,650
Alright. Bhabhi...

940
01:30:14,230 --> 01:30:18,226
One traveler comes,
and another leaves

941
01:30:18,250 --> 01:30:21,300
The world is but an inn

942
01:30:23,380 --> 01:30:25,320
You were right, Choudhuryji.

943
01:30:25,950 --> 01:30:28,130
Troubles come and go.

944
01:30:28,170 --> 01:30:29,970
It doesn't take long
for fortunes to mend.

945
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:33,400
Yes, of course. The things I've
witnessed these past 25 years!

946
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:37,260
One traveler leaves,
and another...

947
01:30:38,460 --> 01:30:39,760
hasn't come yet.

948
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:42,310
We don't feel like
vacating this house.

949
01:30:43,460 --> 01:30:45,210
But now my daughter-in-law
is a mother...

950
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:47,610
and Bhanu is also
employed elsewhere.

951
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:51,770
Yes, yes, Madhav babu.
It's all due to God's...

952
01:30:54,120 --> 01:30:57,920
One traveler comes and
another leaves

953
01:30:57,950 --> 01:31:00,980
The world is but an inn

954
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:10,950
What happened, bhabhi?
Why did you halt?

955
01:31:11,670 --> 01:31:13,650
I'll never forget this house.

956
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:16,790
Perhaps you won't be able to forget
the house we're going to, either.

957
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:18,320
No, Bhanu.

958
01:31:19,150 --> 01:31:21,220
I found your brother
again here...

959
01:31:22,370 --> 01:31:23,770
in this baby.

960
01:31:25,410 --> 01:31:28,870
I'll never forget
this house. Never.

961
01:31:30,250 --> 01:31:33,560
Each dawn forgets
the night gone before...

962
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:37,526
One traveler comes and
another leaves

963
01:31:37,550 --> 01:31:40,680
The world is but an inn

964
01:31:57,690 --> 01:32:00,010
Look, sir, here's my house.

965
01:32:00,900 --> 01:32:03,910
- There isn't a house like this in...
- the whole world. Right?

966
01:32:04,260 --> 01:32:07,550
My dear sir, I'm a lawyer too.
It's my job to fabricate stories.

967
01:32:07,930 --> 01:32:10,780
All you need to tell me is,
what's the rent?

968
01:32:10,910 --> 01:32:14,460
My, Lawyer saab, you want to know the
decision before listening to the case?

969
01:32:14,590 --> 01:32:16,100
First, look over the house.

970
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:17,750
- Alright.
- Please come.

971
01:32:25,110 --> 01:32:27,590
- Hundreds have come here...
- and thousands have left.

972
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:29,600
Perhaps that's why
it couldn't be cleaned.

973
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:32,300
What are you saying, Lawyer saab?

974
01:32:32,730 --> 01:32:37,590
You tell me, can cleanliness reside
where humans do?

975
01:32:39,170 --> 01:32:42,990
- You want it for only a month, right?
- Yes, that will do for now.

976
01:32:43,570 --> 01:32:46,950
And longer... I can only decide
after I get the doctor's report.

977
01:32:47,610 --> 01:32:49,030
If they give us any hope...

978
01:32:49,700 --> 01:32:52,136
then, we may have to stay
a few months for the treatment.

979
01:32:52,160 --> 01:32:53,680
Here's a month's rent
in advance.

980
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:58,250
You didn't have to pay now, brother.
What's the hurry?

981
01:32:58,630 --> 01:32:59,830
It's urgent.

982
01:32:59,890 --> 01:33:02,171
Negotiations were successful, and
we even became brothers.

983
01:33:03,020 --> 01:33:05,500
You're a very intelligent man.
And why not?

984
01:33:05,930 --> 01:33:08,270
You're the public prosecutor,
after all.

985
01:33:08,390 --> 01:33:12,810
- Okay, what about furniture and...?
- I'll take care of all that, don't worry.

986
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:15,490
Your sister must be getting
worried at the hospital.

987
01:33:15,740 --> 01:33:17,780
Your nephew will recover soon.

988
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:19,816
My house is extremely lucky.

989
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:22,400
- Alright, give me the keys.
- Of course, here it is.

990
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:25,050
- Here. - Namaste.
- Namaste.

991
01:33:26,340 --> 01:33:30,030
Our wayward gazes meet playfully

992
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:40,060
If the world burns
with envy, let it be

993
01:34:10,790 --> 01:34:13,430
Mother! Please come here, mother...

994
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:16,080
Come here.

995
01:34:19,190 --> 01:34:20,750
- What's it, dear?
- Mother...

996
01:34:20,940 --> 01:34:23,700
- The wrestler fell down; please pick it up, mother.
- Here it is.

997
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:28,660
Hey! See, mother...

998
01:34:28,860 --> 01:34:31,840
the wrestler doesn't fall at all. And
if he does, he doesn't get up.

999
01:34:32,110 --> 01:34:33,650
Just like me!

1000
01:34:33,850 --> 01:34:36,680
It doesn't hurt at all, but when it does,
it doesn't go away either.

1001
01:34:37,290 --> 01:34:38,510
Come, Raja...

1002
01:34:41,250 --> 01:34:44,070
Look at this...
what a nice book!

1003
01:34:45,450 --> 01:34:48,460
And this child is so handsome,
just like you.

1004
01:34:49,020 --> 01:34:52,400
No... he can walk.
I'm unable to do so.

1005
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:56,430
You will also walk, now that we have
taken you to a specialist. Right?

1006
01:34:57,780 --> 01:35:00,420
Uma, here, take this. The doctor
prescribed these medicines.

1007
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:02,660
Bhaiyya, what did
the doctor say?

1008
01:35:02,780 --> 01:35:04,700
What can the doctor say?
It's too soon.

1009
01:35:06,130 --> 01:35:09,550
The doctor is my friend. He'll send
the report along in a couple of days.

1010
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:11,140
Why're you worried?

1011
01:35:12,070 --> 01:35:14,890
I've to go to Ahmedabad tomorrow
for an important case.

1012
01:35:16,380 --> 01:35:19,720
I've arranged for your meals to be
sent from the hotel across the street.

1013
01:35:20,670 --> 01:35:23,080
Uncle, what's that?

1014
01:35:25,110 --> 01:35:30,710
- What?
- That... that... that thing that's fluttering around the light.

1015
01:35:30,830 --> 01:35:32,710
Those? Those are moths.

1016
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,840
Moths? Why do they
gather around the light?

1017
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:38,440
What a question! Why do moths
gather around a light?

1018
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:40,910
They come to die.

1019
01:35:41,450 --> 01:35:43,530
- Why do they come to die?
- The same question again?

1020
01:35:44,130 --> 01:35:47,050
When they experience death throes,
they come to the light.

1021
01:35:47,960 --> 01:35:50,700
Death throes?
What are death throes?

1022
01:35:50,780 --> 01:35:53,500
Stop arguing! Death throes...

1023
01:35:53,660 --> 01:35:56,430
are what your mother and I
are experiencing with you along.

1024
01:35:56,870 --> 01:35:59,140
- Bhaiyya!
- What 'bhaiyya'?

1025
01:35:59,950 --> 01:36:03,280
He simply drives me nuts! Even
we lawyers don't argue so much.

1026
01:36:03,900 --> 01:36:06,750
Make the bed, I'm going to sleep.
I've to leave early morning.

1027
01:36:11,060 --> 01:36:14,350
- Mother, I won't stay here.
- Then where will you stay?

1028
01:36:15,480 --> 01:36:18,930
There, in that room.
I can't see anything here.

1029
01:36:19,070 --> 01:36:21,230
Alright, fine. First,
have your medicine...

1030
01:36:21,460 --> 01:36:24,356
- Hmm?
- No. It's the same disgusting medicine.

1031
01:36:24,380 --> 01:36:27,500
No, my dear Raja, today's
medicine is very sweet.

1032
01:36:27,710 --> 01:36:29,560
Here, close your eyes,
and drink it. Quickly!

1033
01:36:31,230 --> 01:36:33,020
It's good. isn't it?

1034
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:40,450
- Mother, today's medicine was very, very sweet.
- Wasn't it?

1035
01:36:41,240 --> 01:36:43,590
Now, my dear Raja will
take his medicine...

1036
01:36:43,970 --> 01:36:47,616
get better, grow up,
get a job...

1037
01:36:47,640 --> 01:36:49,350
and drive my troubles away.
Won't you?

1038
01:36:49,670 --> 01:36:53,590
- Mother? - Hmm?
- By the time I get better, you won't be alive, will you?

1039
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:06,310
No, my son.
I won't be here.

1040
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:09,590
I definitely won't
be here, my son.

1041
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:52,230
- Uma, you're weeping?
- If the doctor said...

1042
01:37:53,690 --> 01:37:56,980
- that Raja's legs will never get better...
- He hasn't said that yet, has he?

1043
01:37:57,400 --> 01:37:58,830
You've already begun crying.

1044
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:02,960
What do I do but cry?

1045
01:38:04,390 --> 01:38:06,160
What an unfortunate being I am...

1046
01:38:07,140 --> 01:38:09,010
I lost everything to gain a son.

1047
01:38:10,280 --> 01:38:11,890
He was my only hope.

1048
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,600
Don't be worried, my dear.
God will be merciful.

1049
01:38:17,330 --> 01:38:18,530
Yes, bhaiyya...

1050
01:38:20,570 --> 01:38:22,170
Now he's my only support.

1051
01:38:23,260 --> 01:38:25,910
But what if He doesn't want
my son to walk?

1052
01:38:26,410 --> 01:38:29,920
Then we will suffer that future.
Now, go sleep. Come.

1053
01:38:31,110 --> 01:38:34,980
You go sleep, bhaiyya.
Leave me alone for a while.

1054
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:09,230
Alright, Uma... I'm leaving.

1055
01:39:09,640 --> 01:39:12,850
Bhaiyya, if you wait until
the doctor sends the report...

1056
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:15,530
- will you face a big loss?
- Loss?

1057
01:39:15,930 --> 01:39:18,250
The testimony of the man
whose case it is, will be useless.

1058
01:39:18,360 --> 01:39:20,346
What does 'testimony'
mean, Uncle?

1059
01:39:20,370 --> 01:39:21,670
Listen to him!

1060
01:39:21,820 --> 01:39:25,740
A man benefits only when another's
statement goes unrecorded.

1061
01:39:25,990 --> 01:39:28,010
If men don't fight
amongst themselves...

1062
01:39:28,140 --> 01:39:29,780
then how will
we lawyers survive?

1063
01:39:30,820 --> 01:39:32,850
Why do men fight?

1064
01:39:33,390 --> 01:39:38,500
Be quiet, grandpa. If you were the lawyer,
the poor judge would have run away.

1065
01:39:38,970 --> 01:39:40,970
For God's sake, please
let me go in peace.

1066
01:39:41,410 --> 01:39:44,500
I beg of you, now don't ask me
what 'in peace' means.

1067
01:39:45,180 --> 01:39:47,820
Uma... here's some money.

1068
01:39:48,780 --> 01:39:52,216
Keep it. I'll be back by the time
the doctor's report arrives.

1069
01:39:52,240 --> 01:39:55,140
- In fact, I'll try to return as soon as possible, okay?
- Alright.

1070
01:40:10,930 --> 01:40:12,660
Sit here.

1071
01:40:16,040 --> 01:40:18,510
Now look, you can see
better from here, can't you?

1072
01:40:18,990 --> 01:40:24,450
Yes, mother, everything. Look there,
shops, cars, people... Look...

1073
01:40:24,680 --> 01:40:27,940
- Mother, sir had told me to give you milk for his milk and tea.
- Okay.

1074
01:40:42,900 --> 01:40:44,100
Little master...

1075
01:40:45,210 --> 01:40:46,510
here's a lollipop.

1076
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:51,090
- Who are you?
- Me? I work in that hotel over there.

1077
01:40:51,530 --> 01:40:54,740
- Oh. What's your name?
- Choti. Mohan Choti.

1078
01:40:55,170 --> 01:40:57,600
- Choti?
- Choti...

1079
01:40:58,540 --> 01:41:01,260
- Come, Choti, let's talk.
- Oh my god!

1080
01:41:01,410 --> 01:41:04,210
If I talk here, my boss will
kick me over there.

1081
01:41:04,690 --> 01:41:07,800
Kick you? ls your boss
a bad man?

1082
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:10,280
All bosses are bad men,
little master.

1083
01:41:10,670 --> 01:41:12,350
- Your restaurant is bad too.
- Eh?

1084
01:41:12,830 --> 01:41:15,160
Why does it play
bad music day and night?

1085
01:41:15,320 --> 01:41:18,000
Really? Well, I'll play some really
good music for you one day.

1086
01:41:18,110 --> 01:41:19,780
- What 'thing'?
- Violin.

1087
01:41:20,020 --> 01:41:21,980
- Violin?
- Don't you know what a violin is?

1088
01:41:22,580 --> 01:41:24,020
Oh... violin!

1089
01:41:26,190 --> 01:41:30,940
I'll definitely listen to that...

1090
01:41:31,160 --> 01:41:33,820
- Yes, tell me, who plays
the violin at night?

1091
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:35,820
- It's Pagla babu.
- Pagla babu?

1092
01:41:35,880 --> 01:41:38,530
- Yes, mother, Choti will bring him along.
- Really?

1093
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:41,490
Yes, mother. In truth, if you
give him a bundle of notes...

1094
01:41:41,670 --> 01:41:44,860
he won't come. But if I tell him
that little master is sick...

1095
01:41:45,010 --> 01:41:46,790
that he can't walk, he may come.

1096
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:51,190
- Alright, little master, I'll definitely tell Pagla babu.
- Okay.

1097
01:41:51,810 --> 01:41:54,170
- Alright, mother.
- Okay... Come, let's go drink your milk.

1098
01:41:54,730 --> 01:41:58,710
- Mother, please open that window.
- Yes, indeed I will. Drink your milk.

1099
01:42:21,970 --> 01:42:23,270
Suresh Chandra, B.A.LLB...

1100
01:42:40,790 --> 01:42:44,540
My dear Suresh, after much deliberation,
I've reached the conclusion...

1101
01:42:44,830 --> 01:42:47,111
that Raja isn't going to benefit
from medicines any more.

1102
01:42:47,370 --> 01:42:49,030
Now, it's up to God's grace.

1103
01:42:49,290 --> 01:42:51,910
Yours, Doctor Bhandari.

1104
01:42:56,770 --> 01:43:00,520
Mother... where are you, mother?

1105
01:43:03,310 --> 01:43:06,880
Come here, please...
why are you crying, mother?

1106
01:43:10,740 --> 01:43:14,160
- Will you give me my medicine?
- No.

1107
01:43:14,850 --> 01:43:17,910
- Why? - It's over.
- It's over?

1108
01:43:18,300 --> 01:43:21,290
That's good in a way.
It was very bitter.

1109
01:43:22,150 --> 01:43:24,940
What's the use of taking it?
Now, I'll never get better.

1110
01:43:25,420 --> 01:43:28,390
Who says so? Who says
you'll never be cured?

1111
01:43:29,350 --> 01:43:32,870
- The doctor said so.
- When? When did the doctor come here to say that?

1112
01:43:34,680 --> 01:43:36,750
No... the doctor didn't come here.

1113
01:43:37,130 --> 01:43:39,530
You wept while reading his
letter the other day, didn't you?

1114
01:43:45,470 --> 01:43:49,770
Mother... Pagle babu! Pagle babu
has come. Call him, mother, please...

1115
01:44:16,490 --> 01:44:18,980
Listen... my son is ill...

1116
01:44:19,790 --> 01:44:21,190
Will you meet him?

1117
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:25,700
Raja!

1118
01:45:02,540 --> 01:45:04,040
Why did you come here?

1119
01:45:04,910 --> 01:45:08,150
- Who called you?
- It was you who called me.

1120
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:12,310
No... I didn't call you!

1121
01:45:12,510 --> 01:45:16,470
- Then, perhaps, that...
- Go away! Go away from here! Go away.

1122
01:45:27,260 --> 01:45:30,370
What happened, mother? Why
didn't you let Pagle babu come in?

1123
01:45:30,470 --> 01:45:33,520
Please let him come, mother...
Pagle babu... Pagle babu...

1124
01:45:37,410 --> 01:45:39,090
ls your name Pagle babu?

1125
01:45:40,430 --> 01:45:43,200
Pshaw! Can anyone
be named Pagla babu?

1126
01:45:43,890 --> 01:45:45,500
Please tell me your real name.

1127
01:45:47,210 --> 01:45:50,190
- What's your name?
- My name is Raja.

1128
01:45:52,570 --> 01:45:56,400
- What's your name?
- Eh? What did you say?

1129
01:45:56,820 --> 01:45:59,560
- What's... what's your name?
- My name? - Mm...

1130
01:45:59,980 --> 01:46:02,840
Er... why don't you
call me uncle?

1131
01:46:03,220 --> 01:46:06,680
- Uncle? - Yes. - Just 'uncle'?
- Yes, just 'uncle. - No, 'good uncle'.

1132
01:46:06,990 --> 01:46:09,440
- Not good... say 'bad uncle'.
- No. Good uncle.

1133
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:13,610
- 'Good uncle' is a good name, isn't it?
- Of course it is.

1134
01:46:14,450 --> 01:46:16,490
- Okay, tell me something...
- What?

1135
01:46:17,110 --> 01:46:18,970
Why was mother scolding you?

1136
01:46:21,270 --> 01:46:25,650
- That was not a scolding, my dear.
- Then, why don't you play the violin?

1137
01:46:30,220 --> 01:46:32,120
The string broke, my dear.

1138
01:46:32,310 --> 01:46:34,280
Lies. Just lies.

1139
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:37,440
I know that even if someone
gives you lots of money...

1140
01:46:37,580 --> 01:46:39,950
you will neither come,
nor play the violin.

1141
01:46:41,570 --> 01:46:45,520
I can't walk. That's why
I didn't come to you.

1142
01:46:45,910 --> 01:46:47,800
You won't play
your violin for me?

1143
01:46:48,620 --> 01:46:52,570
Alright. I'll play for you. I'll play the
song of the bhanwra (bees) for you.

1144
01:46:52,670 --> 01:46:54,630
Bhanwra? What does
'bhanwra' mean?

1145
01:46:56,630 --> 01:46:59,660
Look, son, you know
there are flowers...

1146
01:46:59,810 --> 01:47:01,790
- Hm.
- Well, similarly, there are bees as well.

1147
01:47:02,660 --> 01:47:05,220
Flowers are beautiful,
very bright...

1148
01:47:05,690 --> 01:47:08,256
and bees? Their bodies
are black...

1149
01:47:08,280 --> 01:47:09,910
they have simple minds...

1150
01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:12,620
and they are all-time
conoisseurs of nectar.

1151
01:47:13,530 --> 01:47:16,940
And, so, they are always
hovering around the flowers.

1152
01:47:17,220 --> 01:47:19,120
- And, do you know what they do?
- What?

1153
01:47:19,950 --> 01:47:24,010
They go 'ghoom ghoom ghoom
ghoom ghoom ghoom...'

1154
01:47:24,040 --> 01:47:27,100
Ghoom, ghoom, ghoom,
ghoom, ghoom...

1155
01:47:27,460 --> 01:47:31,670
- ghoom, ghoom...
- And then the bee flies around and sits on a flower.

1156
01:47:33,250 --> 01:47:35,770
It is so engrossed
in getting nectar...

1157
01:47:36,180 --> 01:47:38,780
that it forgets everything,
including itself.

1158
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:44,100
And then... the dark,
black night approaches...

1159
01:47:45,410 --> 01:47:48,520
slowly, softly, quietly...

1160
01:47:50,350 --> 01:47:52,050
The flower folds its petals...

1161
01:47:53,480 --> 01:47:57,340
- and the bhanwra...
it can neither come nor go.

1162
01:50:19,660 --> 01:50:22,580
- Alright, my dear, I'll leave now.
- Where?

1163
01:50:23,410 --> 01:50:27,010
- I don't know.
- Don't you have a home?

1164
01:50:27,330 --> 01:50:28,850
My house burned down.

1165
01:50:30,780 --> 01:50:33,790
Good uncle...
listen, good uncle...

1166
01:50:33,970 --> 01:50:37,970
Mother, his house burned down,
mother, please let him stay with us.

1167
01:50:38,010 --> 01:50:41,460
Mother, please call him...
Mother... Mother!

1168
01:50:41,890 --> 01:50:43,290
- Raja!
- Mother...

1169
01:50:47,090 --> 01:50:50,000
- You didn't get hurt, did you?
- What happened?

1170
01:50:50,140 --> 01:50:52,780
Caught you! Now, I won't
let you go.

1171
01:50:52,940 --> 01:50:57,180
I'll never let you go. You can walk;
that's why you left me and went away.

1172
01:51:48,530 --> 01:51:49,940
I'm leaving, Uma.

1173
01:51:52,400 --> 01:51:54,820
I promise I didn't
deliberately come here.

1174
01:51:56,140 --> 01:51:58,140
That boy who works
in the hotel? He told me...

1175
01:51:59,120 --> 01:52:01,220
there's a child here,
who cannot walk.

1176
01:52:02,200 --> 01:52:04,730
How could I know
he was your son?

1177
01:52:06,920 --> 01:52:09,560
For the past seven years,
I've been trying...

1178
01:52:10,910 --> 01:52:12,670
never to cross paths with you.

1179
01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:15,800
To go so far away
from you that...

1180
01:52:16,530 --> 01:52:18,620
no trace of me would
ever reach you.

1181
01:52:20,510 --> 01:52:22,090
Many a time, I wished...

1182
01:52:23,220 --> 01:52:26,580
I could see you once...
just once.

1183
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:31,520
But, each time, I suppressed
this rising desire.

1184
01:52:33,330 --> 01:52:36,180
And it continued to simmer
in a corner of my heart.

1185
01:52:38,180 --> 01:52:40,590
But today, the Fates
mocked me cruelly.

1186
01:52:41,820 --> 01:52:45,180
And, when I lifted my gaze,
I found you standing before me.

1187
01:52:46,860 --> 01:52:49,150
- No one else but you.
- Raja!

1188
01:52:51,370 --> 01:52:52,770
Please forgive me, Uma.

1189
01:52:54,050 --> 01:52:55,150
Listen...

1190
01:53:03,950 --> 01:53:05,500
you left your violin behind.

1191
01:53:06,970 --> 01:53:08,440
I'll take it another time.

1192
01:53:23,950 --> 01:53:26,330
- You called me, mother?
- Yes. Listen...

1193
01:53:27,410 --> 01:53:30,670
Do you know anything about the
gentleman who visited us yesterday?

1194
01:53:30,970 --> 01:53:33,520
Yesterday? Oh, you mean
Pagla babu?

1195
01:53:33,990 --> 01:53:36,590
Yes... where does he stay?

1196
01:53:37,090 --> 01:53:39,220
Do crazy people have a
permanent residence, madam?

1197
01:53:39,430 --> 01:53:42,440
Sometimes, he lies on the footpath;
or you can find him under a tree.

1198
01:53:42,640 --> 01:53:44,670
One day, he fell asleep
on the railway tracks.

1199
01:53:44,890 --> 01:53:46,680
He was lucky the train was late.

1200
01:53:47,960 --> 01:53:50,440
Where does he eat?
What does he do?

1201
01:53:50,690 --> 01:53:52,780
What can he do, madam?
During the day, he sings...

1202
01:53:53,010 --> 01:53:55,970
and that too, only if he feels like it.
And if someone wishes...

1203
01:53:56,130 --> 01:53:58,770
they give him a few coins.
And when nothing happens...

1204
01:53:59,160 --> 01:54:01,280
then I give him some food
without my boss's knowledge.

1205
01:54:02,070 --> 01:54:04,670
Whatever anyone might say, madam,
Pagla babu is a good man.

1206
01:54:05,530 --> 01:54:07,560
Pagla babu won't be
alive for long.

1207
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:12,650
- What are you saying?
- Can good men live long, madam?

1208
01:54:12,970 --> 01:54:16,350
Sometimes he hurts so much,
he writhes in agony.

1209
01:54:16,580 --> 01:54:19,780
And then, he drinks so much
that he loses consciousness.

1210
01:54:20,310 --> 01:54:22,010
One day, I took him
to the doctor...

1211
01:54:22,230 --> 01:54:24,640
who took one look and said
he has only a few days to live.

1212
01:54:24,780 --> 01:54:26,230
He'll soon die.

1213
01:54:27,450 --> 01:54:28,790
Pagla babu is amazing, madam.

1214
01:54:29,670 --> 01:54:31,660
When he smiles, the world
turns to look.

1215
01:54:32,250 --> 01:54:34,070
But when he cries,
there's no one.

1216
01:54:34,520 --> 01:54:37,690
- I've seen him, madam.
- Hey...

1217
01:54:39,280 --> 01:54:41,660
- Are you crying, madam?
- No.

1218
01:54:42,680 --> 01:54:43,990
You may go.

1219
01:54:47,510 --> 01:54:48,710
Pagla babu!

1220
01:54:51,940 --> 01:54:54,620
- The doctor was mistaken when he said you were dying.
- Hmm?

1221
01:54:54,740 --> 01:54:57,540
You won't die until you turn hundred.
We were just talking about you.

1222
01:55:04,510 --> 01:55:08,360
I... came to take the violin.
Raja is inside, right?

1223
01:55:13,340 --> 01:55:16,200
- Listen... - Huh?
- Is it true...

1224
01:55:17,280 --> 01:55:20,590
you have no place to stay?
That you sleep on the footpath...

1225
01:55:20,620 --> 01:55:23,830
- That naughty boy must have fed you these stories.
- Is it true?

1226
01:55:24,730 --> 01:55:27,720
That you're always ill? That the
doctor has said that you...

1227
01:55:28,040 --> 01:55:30,520
won't live. Right?

1228
01:55:36,510 --> 01:55:38,400
The man who could only
live by dying...

1229
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:42,550
These sorrowful days,
these pain-filled nights...

1230
01:55:44,080 --> 01:55:45,680
embracing these while weeping...

1231
01:55:46,880 --> 01:55:48,300
and then, bidding farewell,

1232
01:55:49,120 --> 01:55:51,450
moving on, and on and on...

1233
01:55:52,350 --> 01:55:55,770
sinking quietly into a mother's
cool, sweet embrace...

1234
01:55:57,500 --> 01:56:00,140
- Is this death?
- Don't say such things!

1235
01:56:01,380 --> 01:56:03,160
- Will you listen to me?
- What?

1236
01:56:03,830 --> 01:56:05,430
Stay here. In this house.

1237
01:56:05,950 --> 01:56:08,430
- How is that possible?
- Why not?

1238
01:56:09,290 --> 01:56:10,990
Every 'why' need not
have an answer.

1239
01:56:11,430 --> 01:56:13,300
Just say you don't
want to answer me.

1240
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:15,500
Strange...

1241
01:56:16,910 --> 01:56:20,190
You are the same Uma
I knew seven years ago.

1242
01:56:21,200 --> 01:56:23,540
It was only yesterday that
you slammed the door on me...

1243
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:26,590
- and today...
- it doesn't matter. You have to stay here.

1244
01:56:26,860 --> 01:56:29,180
- No, Uma.
- Let's see how you go away.

1245
01:56:30,110 --> 01:56:34,450
Is this Life a game? That you
come and go as you please?

1246
01:56:35,370 --> 01:56:37,000
As if my feelings
don't matter...

1247
01:56:37,970 --> 01:56:39,570
like my heart is a toy...

1248
01:56:40,510 --> 01:56:42,080
that you throw here and there...

1249
01:56:42,920 --> 01:56:45,190
and stow away in some corner
when you go to sleep.

1250
01:56:45,350 --> 01:56:48,110
- You don't know, do you?
- I don't want to hear a word!

1251
01:56:49,370 --> 01:56:53,300
Go, if you please... but know this
before you leave...

1252
01:56:53,960 --> 01:56:55,950
The grief I experienced
because of you,

1253
01:56:56,570 --> 01:56:58,270
the tears you caused
me to weep...

1254
01:56:58,470 --> 01:56:59,670
you know.

1255
01:57:01,200 --> 01:57:04,290
But I've always prayed
for your happiness.

1256
01:57:07,370 --> 01:57:09,080
If you continue to trouble me...

1257
01:57:09,490 --> 01:57:12,160
and, go away
ignoring my pleas...

1258
01:57:12,890 --> 01:57:16,450
there's a God up there. I warn you,
you will bear my curse.

1259
01:57:18,810 --> 01:57:20,010
Alright, Uma...

1260
01:57:21,230 --> 01:57:22,730
I couldn't share
your happiness...

1261
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:25,300
nor your sorrow.

1262
01:57:26,770 --> 01:57:28,330
If my staying here will...

1263
01:57:49,290 --> 01:57:52,170
- We've reached the station!
- Yaay!

1264
01:57:52,570 --> 01:57:56,460
- Dong dong, dong dong! - Good uncle!
- Yes, son? - Look at that!

1265
01:57:56,570 --> 01:57:59,170
Clouds, flowers, plants...

1266
01:57:59,280 --> 01:58:01,940
Look there, Raja, look at that,
there's a flower blooming...

1267
01:58:02,010 --> 01:58:05,146
- The plants are swaying...
- Look there, the clouds are meeting...

1268
01:58:05,170 --> 01:58:07,020
look there, and there
and there and there...

1269
01:58:10,730 --> 01:58:13,700
- Raja, my dear... - Hm?
- We'll fly kites tomorrow.

1270
01:58:14,260 --> 01:58:16,670
- Kite?
- Yes, son. You know kites, don't you?

1271
01:58:16,730 --> 01:58:21,180
- You make it with paper, tie it with string, and you fly it?
- Yes!

1272
01:58:21,420 --> 01:58:23,430
Okay, can I say something,
Good uncle?

1273
01:58:23,570 --> 01:58:27,090
- What's it?
- Remember that song you played that day? The bees' song?

1274
01:58:27,140 --> 01:58:30,100
- That day? - Yes.
- Of course. - And, then...

1275
01:58:30,200 --> 01:58:32,550
can you play the song
of the moths?

1276
01:58:33,060 --> 01:58:35,530
- Moths? - Yes.
- I don't know what moths are.

1277
01:58:35,870 --> 01:58:39,210
- Moths, moths?
- I don't know what moths are. What are they?

1278
01:58:39,600 --> 01:58:43,060
Oh, dear! You're so grown up and
you don't know what moths are?

1279
01:58:43,130 --> 01:58:46,020
What can I do now? Why don't you
tell me what do moths do?

1280
01:58:46,070 --> 01:58:50,840
- They... what? What's the name?
- What?

1281
01:58:51,270 --> 01:58:54,466
- They are attracted to the light?
- A-ha! They're attracted to the light?

1282
01:58:54,490 --> 01:58:56,880
- Yes. - Why do they come to the light?
- To die.

1283
01:58:57,760 --> 01:59:00,350
- Why do they come to die?
- Why do they come to die?

1284
01:59:00,380 --> 01:59:03,800
- Yes?
- Arre, when they're in their death throes, they come to the light.

1285
01:59:03,830 --> 01:59:06,436
Do you even know what you're talking
about or are you just saying so?

1286
01:59:06,460 --> 01:59:10,690
- Tell me, what's 'death throes' mean?
- It's what mother and uncle...

1287
01:59:10,920 --> 01:59:13,350
- are experiencing by bringing me here.
- Raja!

1288
01:59:18,390 --> 01:59:21,360
Who told you the moths come
to the light to die?

1289
01:59:21,450 --> 01:59:23,490
- Uncle told me.
- Your uncle was wrong.

1290
01:59:24,480 --> 01:59:27,590
The moths come to the light
so they can live again.

1291
01:59:27,830 --> 01:59:29,370
Light is life, my son.

1292
01:59:29,680 --> 01:59:33,770
Look, you know the ant, right?
The one which crawls on the ground?

1293
01:59:34,330 --> 01:59:37,540
When it sprouts wings, people say
it's in the throes of death.

1294
01:59:38,300 --> 01:59:41,670
But it sprouts wings so
it can approach the light.

1295
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:46,280
And when it approaches the light,
its life is complete.

1296
01:59:46,940 --> 01:59:49,760
I, too, wish I could
approach the light.

1297
01:59:50,580 --> 01:59:54,010
- But I can't walk.
- You will be able to walk, my son.

1298
01:59:54,380 --> 01:59:57,120
- I'll be able to walk?
- Of course. You will definitely walk...

1299
01:59:57,280 --> 02:00:00,930
you'll wander the world,
see new places...

1300
02:00:01,180 --> 02:00:03,660
That will be fun!

1301
02:00:03,990 --> 02:00:06,650
- Good uncle? - Hm?
- You will come too, won't you?

1302
02:00:06,890 --> 02:00:08,190
- Who? Me?
- Hm...

1303
02:00:10,090 --> 02:00:12,410
I... will go away
much before that my dear.

1304
02:00:12,740 --> 02:00:15,220
- Where?
- Far away...

1305
02:00:15,570 --> 02:00:16,870
To the light?

1306
02:01:42,710 --> 02:01:45,770
- Come in, please.
- Why are you playing this melody?

1307
02:01:50,320 --> 02:01:52,270
- You still remember this?
- Of course.

1308
02:01:53,320 --> 02:01:57,030
Why play a melody
that's lost to us?

1309
02:01:58,570 --> 02:02:00,920
Yet, memories return
once in a while, don't they, Uma?

1310
02:02:01,200 --> 02:02:02,840
What's the need
for these memories?

1311
02:02:05,390 --> 02:02:07,310
Why did you name your son Raja?

1312
02:02:11,450 --> 02:02:12,850
What was the need?

1313
02:02:15,760 --> 02:02:19,470
What's that you're holding?
Let me see?

1314
02:02:27,430 --> 02:02:29,690
Why did you need
to preserve this so carefully?

1315
02:02:31,940 --> 02:02:36,320
Sit, sit down, Uma. isn't this the snap
I took on the terrace of your house?

1316
02:02:38,850 --> 02:02:42,620
Remember I came late that day? And
you hurriedly changed your clothes?

1317
02:02:43,570 --> 02:02:46,280
Then, I took this shot of yours
against the setting sun.

1318
02:02:47,860 --> 02:02:50,350
Those were the days... now,
they remain locked in my heart.

1319
02:02:51,010 --> 02:02:53,990
I remember everything, I haven't
forgotten anything. Truly.

1320
02:02:57,560 --> 02:03:00,610
And this one... this was when
we'd all gone to the lake.

1321
02:03:01,670 --> 02:03:03,670
You'd fought with me over
something silly that day.

1322
02:03:04,560 --> 02:03:07,586
I spent the whole day following you
around, coaxing and cajoling.

1323
02:03:07,610 --> 02:03:09,606
- No?
- I gave in and then, you sulked.

1324
02:03:09,630 --> 02:03:11,940
That was all pretence,
just to tease you.

1325
02:03:13,180 --> 02:03:17,840
And yes, while we returning
by boat that evening...

1326
02:03:18,290 --> 02:03:21,680
It was that day, wasn't it,
that you sang a song?

1327
02:03:22,820 --> 02:03:24,220
What was that song?

1328
02:03:25,100 --> 02:03:28,900
- It had such lovely lyrics...
- Why? You remember everything, don't you?

1329
02:03:28,980 --> 02:03:31,890
Of course I remember; it's there
at the back of my mind. Wait...

1330
02:03:33,320 --> 02:03:34,890
Ah, yes, now I remember.

1331
02:03:52,350 --> 02:04:00,350
The attachment doesn't end

1332
02:04:07,990 --> 02:04:11,790
Even though you live (your life)

1333
02:04:19,050 --> 02:04:23,230
Even though you live

1334
02:04:24,980 --> 02:04:32,980
Oh my heart, a mystic
engrossed in its own joy...

1335
02:04:53,570 --> 02:05:00,900
Who can enlighten it?

1336
02:05:04,580 --> 02:05:12,580
Who can enlighten it, my lord?

1337
02:05:13,820 --> 02:05:21,820
- Even though you live...
- the attachment doesn't end

1338
02:05:26,840 --> 02:05:34,340
[Lord] Rama...
even though we live

1339
02:05:34,940 --> 02:05:42,940
Your smile sparkles amongst the stars,
the moon is but your shadow

1340
02:05:46,100 --> 02:05:54,100
There are only as many melodies
as the nights we spent together

1341
02:06:04,010 --> 02:06:12,010
How do I say this, my beloved?

1342
02:06:13,670 --> 02:06:18,860
What do I do?

1343
02:06:23,700 --> 02:06:28,880
Even though we live...

1344
02:06:29,460 --> 02:06:35,240
Rain drops gently drizzle
pitter patter

1345
02:06:35,540 --> 02:06:41,550
Sprinkling words of love

1346
02:06:42,180 --> 02:06:50,180
How many rains dissolved in
the sweet fires [of desire]?

1347
02:07:09,220 --> 02:07:17,040
I wonder whom this crazed heart

1348
02:07:17,890 --> 02:07:22,540
settled on, infected [with love]

1349
02:07:27,120 --> 02:07:33,180
Even though we live...

1350
02:07:36,840 --> 02:07:39,070
- May I ask you something?
- Hmm?

1351
02:07:39,960 --> 02:07:43,660
- Will you answer truthfully?
- Yes, I'll only speak the truth.

1352
02:07:47,300 --> 02:07:48,500
Please ask.

1353
02:07:51,390 --> 02:07:55,560
Had you written the truth in that letter?
That you don't love me?

1354
02:07:59,170 --> 02:08:01,530
Why are you silent?
Answer me.

1355
02:08:02,620 --> 02:08:06,750
Was it true that marrying me
would have been a big mistake?

1356
02:08:09,910 --> 02:08:11,820
Yes, Uma. It would have been
a huge mistake.

1357
02:09:29,380 --> 02:09:32,470
- Good uncle? - Yes, son?
- I quite forgot to tell you something.

1358
02:09:32,770 --> 02:09:35,680
- What did you forget to tell me?
- That tree there...

1359
02:09:35,980 --> 02:09:37,510
- Which one? That tree?
- That one...

1360
02:09:38,010 --> 02:09:40,100
- This small one? - Yes.
- What about it?

1361
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:42,756
Yesterday, I had a dream.

1362
02:09:42,780 --> 02:09:45,540
- You had a dream? - Yes.
- What did you see?

1363
02:09:45,860 --> 02:09:50,516
There's a huge red flower
behind that tree.

1364
02:09:50,540 --> 02:09:52,340
- Behind that tree?
- Yes. - And?

1365
02:09:52,650 --> 02:09:56,740
And that tree was swaying
like this... and this... and this.

1366
02:09:57,140 --> 02:10:00,726
- It was blooming?
- Not blooming. Swaying. - Oh, swaying.

1367
02:10:00,750 --> 02:10:06,900
- Okay, then what happened, dear?
- And it was singing a lovely song.

1368
02:10:07,260 --> 02:10:10,940
You saw such a wonderful
dream, dear Raja?

1369
02:10:11,240 --> 02:10:13,240
- Isn't it wonderful, good uncle?
- It's very good.

1370
02:10:13,750 --> 02:10:16,110
Raja, my dear, do you know who
sends these wonderful dreams?

1371
02:10:16,160 --> 02:10:18,260
- Who sends them?
- You don't know?

1372
02:10:19,240 --> 02:10:23,920
- I wish I could walk.
- Then you will walk, my dear.

1373
02:10:24,250 --> 02:10:25,920
- I'll walk? - Yes.
- When?

1374
02:10:26,420 --> 02:10:30,020
- Er... when those red flowers bloom on that tree...
- Yes?

1375
02:10:30,130 --> 02:10:36,230
And then, the sun will emerge from
behind the clouds in a golden chariot

1376
02:10:36,450 --> 02:10:39,550
He will hold a whip
made of sunrays...

1377
02:10:39,730 --> 02:10:43,010
with which he'll whip
his horses.

1378
02:10:43,190 --> 02:10:45,946
The whip will whistle, and land
'thwap' on the saddle...

1379
02:10:45,970 --> 02:10:49,110
Here a whip, there a lash...

1380
02:10:49,290 --> 02:10:53,560
And the horses will gallop
clippety clop, clippety clop...

1381
02:11:01,080 --> 02:11:02,480
What happened, Good uncle?

1382
02:11:03,990 --> 02:11:06,720
Good uncle, what happened,
Good uncle?

1383
02:11:07,370 --> 02:11:09,900
Good uncle... what happened?

1384
02:11:11,890 --> 02:11:15,510
Good uncle... Good uncle!

1385
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:18,200
Good uncle!

1386
02:11:18,710 --> 02:11:19,920
Good uncle!

1387
02:11:23,830 --> 02:11:31,830
[Indistinct conversation]

1388
02:11:39,450 --> 02:11:41,270
Mother, didn't Good uncle come?

1389
02:11:41,730 --> 02:11:44,690
- Not yet.
- Why is he so late?

1390
02:11:45,320 --> 02:11:48,680
- I don't know, son.
- Mother, Good uncle is very good, isn't he?

1391
02:11:48,930 --> 02:11:51,490
He said I would be able to walk.

1392
02:11:51,790 --> 02:11:54,850
When I'm able to walk,
I won't stay in this house.

1393
02:11:55,230 --> 02:11:57,590
I'll go away, far away.
Far, far away.

1394
02:11:57,700 --> 02:11:59,650
- Far, far away.
- Then, what about me?

1395
02:11:59,890 --> 02:12:02,530
I'll take you along.

1396
02:12:04,010 --> 02:12:06,640
Mother, Good uncle has come.

1397
02:12:08,920 --> 02:12:11,070
Bhaiyya! You were away
for so long!

1398
02:12:11,460 --> 02:12:14,536
- I'd work. So I got delayed.
- What's 'work', uncle?

1399
02:12:14,560 --> 02:12:16,460
There! I just got here,
and he's begun.

1400
02:12:16,740 --> 02:12:19,430
Listen, I've come home dead tired;
let me take a breath.

1401
02:12:20,440 --> 02:12:23,230
- Has the doctor's report arrived?
- Yes.

1402
02:12:23,740 --> 02:12:26,800
- What does it say?
- Er.. Bhaiyya, come here.

1403
02:12:31,360 --> 02:12:33,660
- The doctor hasn't offered any hope.
- Oh.

1404
02:12:36,580 --> 02:12:39,100
So there's no hope
he'll get well?

1405
02:12:39,270 --> 02:12:41,970
Hmph! You think you know
more than Good uncle?

1406
02:12:42,500 --> 02:12:44,410
Good uncle? Who's he?

1407
02:12:44,960 --> 02:12:46,510
Good uncle? Good uncle.

1408
02:12:46,650 --> 02:12:50,480
- But who is he?
- Now you're the one asking questions.

1409
02:12:50,690 --> 02:12:52,920
When I ask questions,
you scold me.

1410
02:12:53,040 --> 02:12:55,840
Stop this nonsense!
Who is he?

1411
02:12:57,910 --> 02:13:00,450
- Raja. - Raja?
- Which Raja?

1412
02:13:02,480 --> 02:13:05,840
Your... I mean... our...

1413
02:13:06,760 --> 02:13:10,490
- He's been here a few days.
- That bastard, fraud, coward!

1414
02:13:10,840 --> 02:13:13,040
I'd heard he was dead!

1415
02:13:13,910 --> 02:13:17,290
He's the man who jilted you;
you let him enter the house?

1416
02:13:17,660 --> 02:13:20,360
The man, for whom you bore
such dishonor...

1417
02:13:20,430 --> 02:13:22,580
Dishonor? What's
dishonor mean, uncle?

1418
02:13:22,680 --> 02:13:24,490
Be quiet! Senseless,
useless kid!

1419
02:13:25,350 --> 02:13:27,520
- Where is he?
- He went out.

1420
02:13:27,660 --> 02:13:29,660
Let him come. I'll kick him
out of the house.

1421
02:13:47,500 --> 02:13:49,800
- Who's it?
- No one, bhaiyya.

1422
02:14:02,790 --> 02:14:10,576
The affection...
the affection will never end.

1423
02:14:10,600 --> 02:14:18,600
[Indistinct singing]

1424
02:14:22,330 --> 02:14:24,330
Don't say anything.
Come with me.

1425
02:14:35,960 --> 02:14:38,260
Just go to sleep.
Don't even talk to me.

1426
02:14:38,580 --> 02:14:40,890
Are you going to trouble me
like this my whole life?

1427
02:14:41,560 --> 02:14:43,480
What can I do now?
Where can I go?

1428
02:15:12,630 --> 02:15:13,840
Stop it!

1429
02:15:15,700 --> 02:15:17,250
I said, 'Stop it!'

1430
02:15:19,490 --> 02:15:21,490
Didn't you hear me?
I said, stop it!

1431
02:15:29,600 --> 02:15:32,290
Go away. Get out of here!

1432
02:15:32,550 --> 02:15:33,950
Now. Right this instant.

1433
02:15:45,170 --> 02:15:46,670
The time has come...

1434
02:15:47,790 --> 02:15:50,820
- for me to go, perhaps.
- Where will you go, in this condition?

1435
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:52,310
I don't know.

1436
02:15:53,230 --> 02:15:56,040
- Far away. Perhaps...
- In this dark night...

1437
02:15:56,630 --> 02:15:58,340
A storm is gathering outside.

1438
02:15:59,790 --> 02:16:01,210
The storm outside...

1439
02:16:02,500 --> 02:16:04,580
and the storm within...

1440
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:06,910
Perhaps they want to merge, Uma.

1441
02:16:09,120 --> 02:16:12,570
Hey... don't shed tears, Uma,

1442
02:16:13,240 --> 02:16:14,960
one should not shed tears.

1443
02:16:16,950 --> 02:16:21,270
It's always this dark when such a
momentous meeting takes place.

1444
02:16:22,740 --> 02:16:24,360
It always thunders like this...

1445
02:16:25,590 --> 02:16:28,230
Lightning always flashes in corners
as it does today.

1446
02:16:30,330 --> 02:16:31,430
And...

1447
02:16:32,430 --> 02:16:37,430
And on life's winding journey,
it bursts upon...

1448
02:16:39,889 --> 02:16:42,989
a tired, weary traveler. Just like this.

1449
02:17:07,150 --> 02:17:10,620
Uma, we won't stay here
any longer.

1450
02:17:11,020 --> 02:17:12,660
We'll leave by the
morning train.

1451
02:17:13,770 --> 02:17:17,090
I'll deal with the landlord
and arrange for the tickets.

1452
02:17:17,950 --> 02:17:21,730
It might be late when I return.
You'd better finish packing by then.

1453
02:17:24,590 --> 02:17:27,600
- Mother, are we leaving?
- Yes, my son.

1454
02:17:28,320 --> 02:17:30,500
Let's take Good uncle along.

1455
02:17:30,760 --> 02:17:32,340
- No.
- Why not, mother?

1456
02:17:32,719 --> 02:17:34,169
Please take him along?

1457
02:17:34,860 --> 02:17:38,130
- Where's he?
- 'The name of Ram is the truth; the name of God is the truth.'

1458
02:17:55,150 --> 02:17:56,260
Mohan...

1459
02:18:01,920 --> 02:18:04,980
- Mohan, where's he?
- I... I don't know.

1460
02:18:05,040 --> 02:18:07,210
You're lying.
You do know.

1461
02:18:07,280 --> 02:18:09,320
- I don't know, madam. I really don't know.
- Mohan!

1462
02:18:09,809 --> 02:18:13,079
- You've called me 'mother'. And, I ask you in her name...
- No!

1463
02:18:13,660 --> 02:18:15,030
He forbade me...

1464
02:18:15,549 --> 02:18:18,079
He's lying there on that
empty ground behind the hotel.

1465
02:18:18,350 --> 02:18:20,700
He's in a bad state, he has
but a few moments to live.

1466
02:18:20,809 --> 02:18:24,039
Do something, mother. It's a
big world but he has no one...

1467
02:18:24,200 --> 02:18:25,580
Do something, mother.

1468
02:18:26,469 --> 02:18:28,639
Mohan... take me to him.

1469
02:19:07,790 --> 02:19:09,000
Doctor saab?

1470
02:19:11,840 --> 02:19:13,400
Let him rest in peace.

1471
02:19:35,230 --> 02:19:36,740
What did the doctor say?

1472
02:19:38,110 --> 02:19:41,070
He said, you...
you would get better.

1473
02:19:44,150 --> 02:19:47,990
The doctor spoke...
spoke the truth.

1474
02:19:50,010 --> 02:19:51,310
No... Uma...

1475
02:19:52,370 --> 02:19:54,750
Don't cry, don't cry.

1476
02:20:01,040 --> 02:20:03,540
I've given you so much grief...

1477
02:20:05,240 --> 02:20:06,970
all your life...

1478
02:20:08,530 --> 02:20:11,230
Uma, I didn't do
any of this deliberately.

1479
02:20:13,050 --> 02:20:14,350
Not on purpose.

1480
02:20:16,700 --> 02:20:18,840
Listen... I...

1481
02:20:20,290 --> 02:20:22,000
- have to tell you so many things.
- No.

1482
02:20:23,180 --> 02:20:26,790
- Listen. - Not now.
- Please listen. Who knows if I'll have the time later...

1483
02:20:29,320 --> 02:20:30,430
Bhaiyya!

1484
02:20:36,910 --> 02:20:39,360
- You brought him back here?
- He's ill, bhaiyya.

1485
02:20:39,740 --> 02:20:42,210
He have very little time left.
Forget he's Raja...

1486
02:20:42,400 --> 02:20:45,140
- As a human being...
- Listen very carefully, Uma...

1487
02:20:45,230 --> 02:20:47,040
if he stays here tonight...

1488
02:20:47,220 --> 02:20:49,100
then, our relationship will end.

1489
02:20:49,690 --> 02:20:51,600
You won't be my sister
nor I your brother.

1490
02:20:52,260 --> 02:20:55,270
I'll leave here tomorrow morning.
You can do as you please after that.

1491
02:23:49,490 --> 02:23:54,250
Uma, whatever I did was
always for your benefit.

1492
02:23:54,610 --> 02:23:56,480
I didn't even marry...

1493
02:23:56,920 --> 02:23:59,530
only so that you would
always be happy.

1494
02:24:00,050 --> 02:24:03,900
Forget that scoundrel. He's always
played fast and loose with your life.

1495
02:24:05,030 --> 02:24:08,590
The only good deed he's done is to
leave here during his last hours.

1496
02:24:09,230 --> 02:24:10,630
Forget him, my dear.

1497
02:24:17,670 --> 02:24:19,890
I overheard your conversation
last night, Uma.

1498
02:24:20,970 --> 02:24:22,280
I'm leaving.

1499
02:24:22,890 --> 02:24:26,640
The matter I began
has remained incomplete.

1500
02:24:28,520 --> 02:24:31,400
Two days before our wedding,
the doctor had told me...

1501
02:24:31,960 --> 02:24:34,110
that I've a terminal disease.

1502
02:24:35,350 --> 02:24:38,000
That's why I left
that letter for you.

1503
02:24:38,870 --> 02:24:40,700
Where I wrote that
I didn't love you.

1504
02:24:41,820 --> 02:24:45,800
I wanted you to forget me...
begin to hate me...

1505
02:24:46,840 --> 02:24:48,590
You did hate me, Uma...

1506
02:24:49,440 --> 02:24:50,990
but you couldn't forget me.

1507
02:24:52,180 --> 02:24:53,580
I couldn't forget either.

1508
02:24:56,300 --> 02:24:59,420
Now I take your memories
with me as I leave...

1509
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:13,030
Uma, forgive me, my dear sister.

1510
02:25:14,310 --> 02:25:17,330
It's not your fault.
It's Fate...

1511
02:25:19,010 --> 02:25:21,800
Come, bhaiyya.
Let's go from here.

1512
02:25:30,470 --> 02:25:32,830
- Raja, my dear...
- Mm? - Get up.

1513
02:25:40,820 --> 02:25:44,480
- Mother, is it morning already?
- Yes. - Where's Good uncle?

1514
02:25:44,790 --> 02:25:46,430
I saw the same
dream yesterday...

1515
02:25:46,720 --> 02:25:49,970
the same large, red flowers,
the same golden chariot...

1516
02:25:50,410 --> 02:25:52,700
Open the window, mother,
won't you, please?

1517
02:25:53,940 --> 02:25:55,720
Mother, where's Good uncle?

1518
02:25:56,060 --> 02:26:00,520
He said when I dreamed the
same dream, I would be able to walk.

1519
02:26:47,890 --> 02:26:49,910
- Raja!
- Mother! Mother...

1520
02:26:50,730 --> 02:26:53,030
Mother, Good uncle
was right, wasn't he?

1521
02:26:53,330 --> 02:26:55,720
When he said I would start walking
when the flowers bloomed?

1522
02:26:55,990 --> 02:26:58,250
Look, I'm walking, and
look over there - flowers!

1523
02:27:09,470 --> 02:27:10,570
Raja!

1524
02:27:28,310 --> 02:27:31,900
Even though I live...

1525
02:27:39,170 --> 02:27:42,980
Even though I live...
