How sweet, baby!

68
00:06:00,851 --> 00:06:02,512
So much love for me. Did you see?

69
00:06:04,755 --> 00:06:06,689
All of you have settled
down after college.

70
00:06:07,258 --> 00:06:09,021
When will my big moment come?

71
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:12,022
l am tired of waiting.

72
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:16,389
Neel, you are going to uS.
TaKe this hero with you.

73
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,828
He is a big bore.

74
00:06:18,302 --> 00:06:20,827
Yeah, dude.
At least he will leave us alone.

75
00:06:21,338 --> 00:06:23,568
once you become a famous singer..

76
00:06:23,641 --> 00:06:26,269
..find a small role for
him in Hollywood. - Perfect.

77
00:06:27,645 --> 00:06:30,409
lf he had to do a small role, he
would have done it a long time bacK.

78
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:35,675
How sweet! Hello. Hold on.

00:06:35,753 --> 00:06:37,812

83
00:06:43,928 --> 00:06:45,327
But l want one more.

Really. l am not drunK yet, man.

87
00:06:55,005 --> 00:06:57,405
Lets have a looK on ViKram Narula's case..

88
00:06:57,475 --> 00:07:01,434
..which became popular.

89
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:04,681
lt has been officially closed down.

90
00:07:05,282 --> 00:07:09,309
You must remember when well-Known
builder ViKrant Narula..

91
00:07:09,386 --> 00:07:13,015
..committed suicide, there
were many rumors maKing the rounds.

92
00:07:13,457 --> 00:07:17,291
Some say that he committed
suicide as he was debt-ridden.

93
00:07:17,328 --> 00:07:19,922
And some say that the
room from where he jumped..

94
00:07:20,331 --> 00:07:23,459
..many people have died in that room.

95
00:07:24,602 --> 00:07:26,035
lt's a strange story.

96
00:07:26,403 --> 00:07:30,567
clD can maKe five
episodes on this mystery.

97
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:31,969
What case is this?

98
00:07:32,443 --> 00:07:33,876
How come l don't Know about it?

99
00:07:34,678 --> 00:07:35,940
lt's about that hotel.

100
00:07:36,313 --> 00:07:37,439
What hotel?

101
00:07:38,716 --> 00:07:39,774
Hotel Grandiose.

102
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,374
The one in news.

103
00:07:41,886 --> 00:07:43,615
Since the time strange incidents
have been occurring there..

104
00:07:43,687 --> 00:07:45,382
..the hotel has been shut down.

105
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:50,317
The owner committed
suicide or he died.

106
00:07:50,561 --> 00:07:51,528
Nobody Knows.

107
00:07:51,595 --> 00:07:53,495
Since then all this is going on.

108
00:07:54,064 --> 00:07:55,326
But poor guy.

109
00:07:55,366 --> 00:07:58,927
No one Knows how
and why that owner died.

110
00:07:58,969 --> 00:08:00,300
You never Know the truth.

111
00:08:00,905 --> 00:08:04,432
l have heard strange
stories about that hotel.

112
00:08:04,842 --> 00:08:06,935
So have l.
l have heard that hotel is haunted.

113
00:08:07,244 --> 00:08:09,872
Yeah. - Many people say
there is 'Vastu Shastra' problem.

114
00:08:10,548 --> 00:08:12,709
But personally,
l don't quite believe it. - No. No.

115
00:08:13,017 --> 00:08:17,420
l have heard that in the hotel,
room number 3046..

116
00:08:17,488 --> 00:08:19,251
..where the man committed suicide..

117
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,281
..many years ago
a girl had died there.

118
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:25,257
Ditto. l have also heard this story.

119
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:27,358
Exactly. - come on.

120
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:30,892
And before dying,
she had invoKed a curse.

121
00:08:31,468 --> 00:08:33,026
What? - That whoever
comes to that building..

122
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,464
..she won't sPare him.

123
00:08:34,939 --> 00:08:35,928
correct. - Yeah.

124
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:39,901
oh come on, guys.
Are we really having this discussion?

125
00:08:41,011 --> 00:08:43,314
What nonsense! - Exactly.

126
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:44,781
lt's such a run-of-the-mill story.

127
00:08:45,282 --> 00:08:47,716
There was a graveyard
under every boarding school.

128
00:08:47,918 --> 00:08:50,853
There was a hospital
under every hotel. What crap!

129
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,448
can we please grow up?

130
00:08:52,523 --> 00:08:54,320
Strange compulsion!

131
00:08:54,592 --> 00:08:55,991
l mean, if you don't
believe in ghosts..

132
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,550
..it doesn't mean they don't exist.

133
00:08:58,028 --> 00:09:00,861
l agree with Maggie.
l don't believe in ghosts.

134
00:09:01,265 --> 00:09:03,426
Why to fear something
you haven't seen?

135
00:09:04,802 --> 00:09:09,466
The day you see it,
you won't be alive to believe it.

136
00:09:21,886 --> 00:09:25,253
Guys, l have a brilliant idea.

137
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:30,424
Let's go to Hotel Grandiose
for Neel's farewell.

138
00:09:31,662 --> 00:09:32,526
To meet the ghost.

139
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:07,524
She will scare the ghost.

140
00:10:07,698 --> 00:10:09,290
Really? - Really?

141
00:10:09,633 --> 00:10:10,998
Yes! - Shall we go?

142
00:10:12,002 --> 00:10:13,401
come. come. come.

143
00:10:13,938 --> 00:10:16,600
This is going to be fun.
- Get down quicKly, Neel. come on.

144
00:10:16,674 --> 00:10:18,665
What are you doing?
l am trying to get down. come on.

145
00:10:19,543 --> 00:10:21,977
Maggie, help me out. - Help yourself.

146
00:10:22,046 --> 00:10:24,742
Listen to me.
We are doing a very wrong thing.

147
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,347
We shouldn't locK horns with this.

148
00:10:29,687 --> 00:10:31,484
What a location, guys!

149
00:10:31,755 --> 00:10:34,349
A film's shooting should
taKe place here. Right?

150
00:10:35,326 --> 00:10:36,588
Sonia is right.

151
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,385
This is just not scary. lt's illegal.

152
00:10:39,763 --> 00:10:41,355
What are we doing?

153
00:10:41,498 --> 00:10:43,329
Having fun.

154
00:10:52,643 --> 00:10:56,044
This one is locKed.
- lt's a sign. Let's just leave.

155
00:10:57,348 --> 00:10:58,576
This is also locKed.

156
00:10:59,016 --> 00:11:01,280
oh God! This place is spooKy.

157
00:11:01,652 --> 00:11:03,813
l love it.

158
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,315
This is also locKed.

159
00:11:08,859 --> 00:11:12,522
They won't leave it open.
Someone must be here.

160
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:13,788
Must be.

161
00:11:47,064 --> 00:11:48,895
So it's a wrap.

162
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,797
Bad lucK, guys. come on. Let's leave.

163
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:53,768
Panty is over.

164
00:11:53,904 --> 00:11:54,871
come on, guys.

165
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:55,835
come, Maggie. - Damn!

166
00:11:55,906 --> 00:11:57,999
Let's just crash at my place. - Yes.

167
00:11:58,409 --> 00:11:59,671
What is this?

168
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:16,652
Sam...what happened?

169
00:12:25,569 --> 00:12:27,400
You are fooling around again,
aren't you?

170
00:12:28,772 --> 00:12:29,898
What is it?

171
00:12:30,741 --> 00:12:31,765
l can hear some sound.

172
00:12:31,842 --> 00:12:33,332
Yeah. l can hear it too.

173
00:12:36,513 --> 00:12:38,481
lt's a radio.
lt's the sound of a radio.

174
00:12:43,353 --> 00:12:45,617
Guys, if there is a radio here..

175
00:12:45,789 --> 00:12:48,587
..it means someone
must be listening to it.

176

..a lot of people
have died in this room.

354
00:28:35,405 --> 00:28:36,838
lncluding the suicide man.

355
00:28:37,607 --> 00:28:38,539
Maggie, drinK up.

356
00:28:38,608 --> 00:28:41,509
Sorry, guys.

DrinK anyone?

359
00:28:46,616 --> 00:28:47,981
Just thinK, man.

360
00:28:49,318 --> 00:28:51,809
There was a time when
this hotel was functional.

361
00:28:52,755 --> 00:28:55,747
Now imagine. A very beautiful girl..

362
00:28:57,026 --> 00:29:00,018
..l would say a hot, sexy girl..

363
00:29:01,264 --> 00:29:03,494
..would have checKed
in at the reception.

364
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,529
She would have come up from the lift.

365
00:29:06,002 --> 00:29:07,560
WalKing stylishly in the corridor..

366
00:29:07,637 --> 00:29:10,697
..she would have reached this door.

367
00:29:12,275 --> 00:29:13,537
After that, she would have gone there.

368
00:29:15,678 --> 00:29:21,344
She would have come here
and closed the cuntain slowly.

369
00:29:23,719 --> 00:29:24,651
Why?

370
00:29:25,254 --> 00:29:28,280
Because she wanted to taKe a shower.
Wow, hottie!

371
00:29:28,691 --> 00:29:30,921
A hot girl is going to
taKe a shower in the hotel.

372
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:33,760
Ready for the shower.

373
00:29:33,996 --> 00:29:35,361
She came here.

374
00:29:35,932 --> 00:29:37,490
ln front of this door.

375
00:29:38,801 --> 00:29:41,634
And then she stanted the shower.

376
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:50,276
What the hell!

377
00:29:50,646 --> 00:29:52,045
lt's one hell of a coincidence!

378
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:57,545
You said shower.. - And the
shower stanted on its own accord.

379
00:29:58,387 --> 00:29:59,615
We will have to checK.

00:30:00,289 --> 00:30:01,654

426
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:08,300
How is this possible?

We are running.
But we are going nowhere.

434
00:33:37,406 --> 00:33:38,600
Don't lose your cool.

No freaKing way.

All of us are going to die, dude.
All of us.

l don't Know what the
hell is happening here.

447
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:04,248
Yes. We shouldn't have come here.

448
00:35:06,495 --> 00:35:08,292
Shut up, Maggi. Just shut up.

449
00:35:08,697 --> 00:35:10,597
We came here because of you.

450
00:35:12,334 --> 00:35:13,824
Ghosts don't exist.

451
00:35:15,337 --> 00:35:16,395
What is all this?

452
00:35:16,772 --> 00:35:18,706
Do you have an
explanation for all this?

453
00:35:19,475 --> 00:35:20,305
Do you.

454
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:22,437
lt better be a good one.

455
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:26,374
Achin, l haven't forced
anyone to come here.

456
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:27,742
You are not Kids.

457
00:35:27,817 --> 00:35:29,717
Stop it, guys. Stop it.

458
00:35:31,353 --> 00:35:33,048
Sam is dead.

459
00:35:34,323 --> 00:35:38,316
Do you Know what that means?
He is dead.

460
00:35:38,494 --> 00:35:41,827
We have lost him.
l've lost him forever.

461
00:35:55,544 --> 00:35:56,442
Guys

462
00:35:58,747 --> 00:35:59,907
.. does anyone have reception?

463
00:35:59,982 --> 00:36:01,711
Please checK again.

464
00:36:05,855 --> 00:36:06,583
No.

465
00:36:10,259 --> 00:36:13,695
But someone's phone rang
when we came to this hotel.

466
00:36:14,663 --> 00:36:16,688
Achin, it was yours, right?

467
00:36:16,765 --> 00:36:17,925
lt was my dad.

468
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,992
But as soon as we entered this hotel,
the call was disconnected.

469
00:36:22,004 --> 00:36:24,802
That means there is reception
outside this hotel, right?

470
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,772
But there is no
reception in the hotel.

471
00:36:27,877 --> 00:36:29,742
And we can't go out of the hotel.

472
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,613
But there must be networK
somewhere in this hotel.

473
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:36,374
There's got to be networK somewhere.

474
00:36:36,452 --> 00:36:37,441
We need to find the terrace.

475
00:36:38,287 --> 00:36:40,016
correct. - There must be a terrace.

476
00:36:40,422 --> 00:36:43,323
He is right. There's got
to be reception on the terrace.

477
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:45,553
We got to get to the terrace.
We must get to the terrace.

Achint, don't go alone.

00:36:54,069 --> 00:36:54,797
Wait.

Guys, be careful. - You stay there.

00:37:00,376 --> 00:37:02,708
And if anything, call out for help.

485
00:37:14,256 --> 00:37:15,382
Dude, terrace?

Watch it.

488
00:37:46,689 --> 00:37:47,951
Excuse me.

489
00:37:52,528 --> 00:37:54,894
Have you come to meet Mr. KaPadia?

490
00:37:55,631 --> 00:37:56,495
Who is she?

491
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:01,832
Doctor is free now. come.

492
00:39:00,763 --> 00:39:03,357
'We don't meet here
to scream and shout.'

493
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:05,964
'Tell me. Why do we meet here?'

494
00:39:07,236 --> 00:39:08,430
'Why do we meet here?'

495
00:39:24,553 --> 00:39:29,013
'Husha. Busha.

496
00:39:29,692 --> 00:39:33,719
We all fall down.'

497
00:40:03,358 --> 00:40:05,986
'Magesh.'

498
00:40:09,498 --> 00:40:12,524
Magesh, stop. Don't go any funther.

499
00:40:26,014 --> 00:40:36,322
'Husha. Busha. We all fall down.'

500
00:40:58,013 --> 00:41:03,417
'We all fall down.'

501
00:41:17,399 --> 00:41:21,733
'Ringa Ringa roses.'

502
00:41:24,373 --> 00:41:28,571
'Ringa Ringa roses.'

503
00:41:29,545 --> 00:41:39,045
'Husha. Busha. We all fall down.'

504
00:42:00,342 --> 00:42:04,779

'PocKet full of roses.'

506
00:42:12,354 --> 00:42:21,353
'Husha. Busha. We all fall down.'

507
00:42:30,772 --> 00:42:32,865
Why the hecK are they
taKing so much time?

508
00:42:33,308 --> 00:42:35,902
Why long does it taKe to
go to the terrace and maKe a call?

509
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:38,472
l'm going to go checK on them.

510
00:42:38,614 --> 00:42:40,445
But where will you looK for them?

511
00:42:40,816 --> 00:42:43,376
obviously,
they've gone to the terrace.

512
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:45,919
l guess there must
be only way to the terrace.

513
00:42:46,889 --> 00:42:49,414
lf they are coming up,
l'll meet them on the way.

514
00:42:50,058 --> 00:42:51,491
l'm going. - Wait.

He's gone, Neel. He's gone.

526
00:43:46,949 --> 00:43:49,782
Both of them. They had gone together.

527
00:43:50,652 --> 00:43:51,778
Achint is dead.

528
00:43:51,987 --> 00:43:53,045
He's not dead.

529
00:43:53,488 --> 00:43:56,048

00:44:42,571 --> 00:44:43,902
She'll not sPare me either.

545
00:44:45,607 --> 00:44:46,801

Achint. Achint, this light.

586
00:48:12,247 --> 00:48:14,545
lf there is light, there should
be electricity somewhere, right?

587
00:48:14,649 --> 00:48:16,981
A generator creates electricity.

588
00:48:17,452 --> 00:48:19,682
Right. And if there is a generator..

589
00:48:19,754 --> 00:48:22,348
..it means there is a
way in and out of here. oKay.

590

There is a way to
get out of this hotel.

lt means we can get out of here.

592
00:48:26,428 --> 00:48:28,658
How?. She is everywhere.

593
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:33,994
lf there is only one way out,
she'll never let us reach it.

594
00:48:34,402 --> 00:48:35,528
Both of you stay with him.

00:58:16,017 --> 00:58:17,575
She was mentally sicK.

712
00:58:17,885 --> 00:58:19,614
She was mentally unstable.

713
00:58:20,688 --> 00:58:23,680
Magesh was right. lt was not a rumour.

714
00:58:24,025 --> 00:58:25,925
There used to be a mental asylum here.

715
00:58:29,764 --> 00:58:31,629
This was perhaps the manager's room.

716
00:58:32,767 --> 00:58:35,497
l found this file in
one of the drawers here.

717
00:58:39,574 --> 00:58:42,304
She murdered her entire family.

718
00:58:43,678 --> 00:58:44,975
lt was a family of seven.

719
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:48,314
When she was produced in the count..

720
00:58:48,382 --> 00:58:50,850
..she said that she
had married the satan.

721
00:58:51,285 --> 00:58:53,651
And she murdered so many
people at the behest of the satan.

722
00:58:53,721 --> 00:58:57,782
'The count, for mental rehabilitation
sends her to state...'

723
00:59:00,695 --> 00:59:05,655
The doctor who has treating her,
she Killed him as well..

724
00:59:05,933 --> 00:59:07,264
..during a psychiatric session.

725
00:59:08,769 --> 00:59:12,227
The doctors and nurses of the hospital
were scared of going close to her.

726
00:59:12,807 --> 00:59:15,970
And 18 people died due to
a shont circuit in the hospital..

727
00:59:16,244 --> 00:59:18,235
..after a few days.

728
00:59:18,512 --> 00:59:21,675
A case was filed.
And the hospital was closed down.

729
00:59:22,783 --> 00:59:24,876
The hospital was closed for years.

730
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:28,484
And a really big hotelier
bought this place..

731
00:59:28,556 --> 00:59:30,547
..to build a hotel.

732
00:59:31,292 --> 00:59:32,816
He built the hotel alright.

733
00:59:33,494 --> 00:59:34,984
But accidents happened regularly.

734
00:59:35,529 --> 00:59:39,989
And the hotel was also
shut down after a few days.

735
00:59:41,769 --> 00:59:43,896
And then ViKrant Nirula
committed suicide..

736
00:59:43,971 --> 00:59:45,939
..by jumping off the roof.

737
00:59:52,813 --> 00:59:54,747
This is so freaKing crazy.

738
00:59:55,783 --> 00:59:59,275
Do you thinK Maya brought
Sonia to this room on purpose?

739
01:00:00,288 --> 01:00:01,915
So that we could read all this.

740
01:00:02,590 --> 01:00:05,491
l feel that Maya
is stucK in these walls.

741
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:08,887
And she wants to tell us something.

742
01:00:09,030 --> 01:00:10,725
She is trying to communicate.

743
01:00:12,733 --> 01:00:14,667
So what do you suggest?

744
01:00:31,585 --> 01:00:32,677
Maya.

745
01:00:34,889 --> 01:00:36,049
Maya.

746
01:00:37,491 --> 01:00:40,016
Maya, we Know your story.

747
01:00:44,532 --> 01:00:46,796
l am trying to reach out to you, Maya.

748
01:00:47,468 --> 01:00:48,833
SpeaK to us.

749
01:00:54,041 --> 01:00:56,032
What do you want from us, Maya?

750
01:00:57,545 --> 01:00:59,570
What do you want from us?

751
01:02:03,744 --> 01:02:04,574
What happened?

752
01:02:06,547 --> 01:02:07,536
What happened?

753
01:02:12,286 --> 01:02:12,877
She..

754
01:02:13,287 --> 01:02:14,311
She said that..

755
01:02:16,290 --> 01:02:17,689
She said that..

756
01:02:19,727 --> 01:02:21,456
She said that she
only wants to Kill us.

757
01:02:23,564 --> 01:02:24,758
She doesn't want anything else.

758
01:02:26,333 --> 01:02:27,857
She just wants to Kill us.

759
01:02:28,669 --> 01:02:29,761
l had told you.

760
01:02:30,037 --> 01:02:32,699
Didn't l tell you?
She wouldn't sPare us.

761
01:02:33,307 --> 01:02:36,299
She will not sPare any of us.
No. - What are we going to do now?.

762
01:02:36,777 --> 01:02:37,709
What are we going to do now?.

763
01:02:38,579 --> 01:02:43,846
We shouldn't have come here.
We are going to die. - No. No.

764
01:02:45,019 --> 01:02:46,577
We will survive, oKay?

765
01:02:47,421 --> 01:02:48,410
We just need to..

766
01:02:48,789 --> 01:02:50,654
We just have to hide.

767
01:02:55,596 --> 01:02:57,530
Keep moving. Keep moving.

768
01:03:05,873 --> 01:03:09,036

Everyone, switch on your phones.

01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:31,758
Yes. - Everyone, give me your hands.

01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:40,937

Yes. - There is nobody else.

We are going to survive.

790
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:07,697
We are going to survive.

791
01:04:18,279 --> 01:04:21,305

792
01:04:21,615 --> 01:04:22,946

01:04:25,853 --> 01:04:28,287
Man, she is coming towards us.

oh no. - Don't leave your hands, oKay?
- Yes. oKay.

797
01:04:31,692 --> 01:04:32,852
Don't leave your hands, guys.

798
01:04:32,927 --> 01:04:34,952
Don't Panic. - Don't give up.
Don't move. Don't move.

799
01:04:36,931 --> 01:04:38,023
calm down, Sonia.

800
01:04:38,499 --> 01:04:42,299
Sonia, calm down.
Guys, she is trying to scare us.

801
01:04:43,003 --> 01:04:45,062
She wants us to go aPant.
But we wouldn't get scared.

802
01:04:45,306 --> 01:04:46,295
calm down.

803
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:47,773
She is coming here.. - calm down.

804
01:04:47,841 --> 01:04:48,739

We will maKe it,

809
01:05:01,255 --> 01:05:02,916
We will all sit together.
oKay? No one must go aPant.

810
01:05:03,857 --> 01:05:05,688
crap. This smoKe
is going on increasing.

811
01:05:05,759 --> 01:05:06,555
crap!

812
01:05:07,661 --> 01:05:08,992
Guys, all of you are oKay, right?

813
01:05:09,396 --> 01:05:11,387
You guys are alright?
Yes? l am going to..

814
01:05:11,465 --> 01:05:13,296
l am going to call out your names.
one by one.

815
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:15,866
Just reply to me. oKay.

816
01:05:16,570 --> 01:05:17,764

01:05:18,405 --> 01:05:21,272
Yes. - Alright.
Alright, it is alright.

818
01:05:22,476 --> 01:05:23,272
Anchit.

819
01:05:23,310 --> 01:05:24,504
Yes. - Yes. Yes, l am here.

820
01:05:24,578 --> 01:05:25,545
Alright

821
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:26,611
Leena. - Yes.

822
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:28,443
Leena. - Yes, yes, l am here.

823
01:05:28,515 --> 01:05:29,846
Alright. Sonia.

824
01:05:32,019 --> 01:05:32,849
Sonia?

825
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:36,378
Sonia. - Sonia,
why are you not saying anything?

826
01:05:38,993 --> 01:05:41,985
Sonia, for God's saKe, just say yes.
You are there.

827
01:05:42,296 --> 01:05:44,890
Yes. l am there.

828
01:05:59,713 --> 01:06:01,271
Go. Go. Go.

829
01:06:01,815 --> 01:06:03,373
Go. Go. Go.

830
01:06:04,551 --> 01:06:06,542
come on.

831
01:06:21,669 --> 01:06:22,966
oh my God.

832
01:06:23,637 --> 01:06:24,831
Soniya.

833
01:06:52,433 --> 01:06:53,559
So this is it.

834
01:06:55,969 --> 01:06:57,596
We are all going to die.

835
01:07:01,742 --> 01:07:05,337
Guys. This is it.

836
01:07:08,015 --> 01:07:09,482
We are all going to die.

837
01:07:10,317 --> 01:07:11,011
This..

838
01:07:13,387 --> 01:07:15,514
We are all going to die..

839
01:07:15,956 --> 01:07:17,753
Did you ever thinK that
this is going to happen with us?

840
01:07:19,026 --> 01:07:21,256
our guesses were wrong.

841
01:07:22,429 --> 01:07:23,953
She wants nothing from us.

842
01:07:24,665 --> 01:07:25,495
But death.

843
01:07:27,334 --> 01:07:29,894
Even if we stay together,
it wouldn't be of any use.

844
01:07:31,572 --> 01:07:32,766
We have to survive.

845
01:07:33,574 --> 01:07:34,768
We have to survive.

846
01:07:35,809 --> 01:07:37,743
There is very less
time left for morning.

847
01:07:38,345 --> 01:07:39,403
Neel. What is the time?

848
01:07:41,382 --> 01:07:42,713
lt is five minutes to four.

849
01:07:45,686 --> 01:07:46,550
one minute.

850
01:07:46,687 --> 01:07:47,984
What time did you say?

851
01:07:48,756 --> 01:07:50,553
l said it is five minutes to four.

852
01:07:50,824 --> 01:07:51,722
oKay?

853
01:07:52,693 --> 01:07:56,060
Neel, do you remember the time l
met you near the shop at the corridor.

854
01:07:58,465 --> 01:07:59,591
lt is very strange.

855
01:08:00,067 --> 01:08:02,262
And maybe this doesn't
even have any logic.

856
01:08:02,703 --> 01:08:07,606
But at that time, every clocK in the
shop was showing five minutes to four.

857
01:08:08,308 --> 01:08:10,776
And it is the same time now.
lt is five minutes to four.

858
01:08:11,345 --> 01:08:13,245
That is so strange, Leena.

859
01:08:13,514 --> 01:08:14,947
And this is not a mere
misconception of mine.

860
01:08:15,349 --> 01:08:16,281
Neel is the proof.

861
01:08:16,917 --> 01:08:18,578
Do you thinK this has a meaning?

862
01:08:18,652 --> 01:08:19,243
Maybe.

863
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:21,947
Guys, liKe deja vu.

864
01:08:22,790 --> 01:08:24,917
When we see something and feel
that we have seen it before as well.

865
01:08:25,292 --> 01:08:25,781
Right?

866
01:08:27,261 --> 01:08:29,786
And premonition and
intuition are the same.

867
01:08:30,664 --> 01:08:31,995
When we can see the
impending things early.

868
01:08:32,266 --> 01:08:33,665
You Know, liKe a proper visual.

869
01:08:34,034 --> 01:08:34,796
Yes?

870
01:08:36,270 --> 01:08:37,328
l don't believe it.

871
01:08:38,272 --> 01:08:39,261
ls this possible?

872
01:08:39,339 --> 01:08:41,273
We will come to Know
of it when we go there.

873
01:08:41,942 --> 01:08:44,740
Guys, we can be saved.
We can be saved.

874
01:08:44,945 --> 01:08:46,037
come on, let us go.

875
01:09:02,729 --> 01:09:03,753
l was standing here.

876
01:09:04,731 --> 01:09:05,925
l was right here.

877
01:09:17,344 --> 01:09:18,436
occult.

878
01:09:24,985 --> 01:09:27,545
lt is written here that every spirit..

879
01:09:27,621 --> 01:09:29,953
.. is connected with
something or human being.

880
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:34,450
And every evil spirit
derives it strength..

881
01:09:34,528 --> 01:09:36,655
.. from the thing it is attached to.

882
01:09:37,564 --> 01:09:42,297
So assume that Maya gets
all her strength from a source.

883
01:09:42,703 --> 01:09:45,399
How would we Know
that what that thing is?

884
01:09:45,706 --> 01:09:47,606
We can come to Know of it.
lt is written here.

885
01:09:47,774 --> 01:09:48,570
What is written there?

886
01:09:49,877 --> 01:09:50,969
There is a chant written here.

887
01:09:51,478 --> 01:09:54,038
We have to hold each

lf you don't listen to us, l hope you
Know what we are going to do to you.

922
01:11:48,495 --> 01:11:50,554
Maya listen to us.

01:14:19,346 --> 01:14:19,835
So..

927
01:14:22,749 --> 01:14:24,478
All the powers are in this machine.

928
01:14:26,753 --> 01:14:28,846
When she was being
given shocK treatment..

929
01:14:29,556 --> 01:14:32,457
..she used all her powers to maKe
the flow of the process go bacKwards.

930
01:14:35,028 --> 01:14:41,399
And since then,
all her powers are in this machine.

931
01:14:43,403 --> 01:14:46,895
Meaning if we burn this
machine in fir, maybe..

932
01:14:47,774 --> 01:14:50,572
Maybe we can get saved from all this.

933
01:14:50,644 --> 01:14:52,373
But how?.

934
01:14:52,779 --> 01:14:54,337
But how are we going to burn it?

935
01:14:54,381 --> 01:14:55,541
There must be something
in the Kitchen, right?

936
01:14:56,049 --> 01:14:57,710
Kerosene. Petrol. Anything.

937
01:14:57,851 --> 01:14:58,476

Maya will not let us taKe the
machine out of here in any situation.

940
01:15:08,528 --> 01:15:09,722
So we got to do something.

941
01:15:09,963 --> 01:15:12,932
Guys. There are four of us.
We got to split us.

942
