1
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:47,442
The day of reckoning
is a beast of its ovvn.

2
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:52,045
It creeps up on you unawares.

3
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:55,210
It arrives on a whim,
with its head held high.

4
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:58,749
And burns everything to ashes.

5
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,166
I still remember that
winter of my childhood.

6
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:11,633
The harshest we had seen in a while.

7
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:18,675
It was as though the valley was
shrouded in the sheet of death.

8
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:49,731
Let me go.

9
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,740
Leave me.

10
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,251
Name?

11
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:09,720
Your name?

12
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:14,993
Noor.

13
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:17,326
Noor what?

14
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,424
Nizami.

15
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:20,159
Noor Nizami.

16
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:26,734
Look, I haven't had a drop of vvater
since the past two days.

17
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,306
I want to eat something right now.

18
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:34,713
If not, I swear I will tear you apart.

19
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:39,619
And, don't even think of running.

20
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:42,691
I'll find you and tear you to pieces.

21
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:07,405
We were a group of five.

22
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,242
Three were killed by the army
on the border.

23
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:15,649
One of us had turned traitor.

24
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:19,354
I dug out that bastard from hell.

25
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:21,254
And gouged his eye out.

26
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:26,120
Now his one eye will haunt him
for the rest of his life.

27
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:33,230
Is there a place
where I can spend the night?

28
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:15,477
- Warning!
The army has you surrounded.

29
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:18,572
- We don't want any loss to life.

30
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:21,209
- Give up your arms. Surrender!

31
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:23,548
- Check over there.

32
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:27,285
- We are warning you again.

33
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,621
- Give up your arms.

34
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:31,092
- Surrender!

35
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:33,562
- Or you'll be killed.

36
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:55,341
Give me the tool box.

37
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:58,578
Noora.

38
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:02,659
So we are catching a cold now, are we?

39
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:05,688
Where were you last night?

40
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,399
I fell asleep waiting for you.

41
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,732
I had sent him...
to get the tools from the tool shed.

42
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:14,737
I was stuck in the snow, sister.

43
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:18,702
You two have worked hard enough
to create the Taj Mahal!

44
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:21,107
Are the designs for the
embroidery ready?

45
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,215
Why don't you show them?

46
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,986
You both can do as you please.

47
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,494
I request you to
please come home early.

48
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:38,584
Eid preparations
haven't even begun yet.

49
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,725
Go carefully, dear.

50
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,292
The situation in the city is not safe.

51
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,499
Why do you do this?

52
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,070
You know she gets worried.

53
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:51,368
L-low long will I cover for you'?

54
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,450
These are beautiful, Noor!

55
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,986
Have you made this?

56
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:10,958
Why didn't you show them to her?

57
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,087
This time I want a hefty Eid gift.

58
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:15,028
Don't be miserly.

59
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:20,968
In cross firing with the army
three millitants were killed.

60
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,337
Millitant commander Ivluazzam Bhatt
is still at large.

61
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,671
The situation has worsened

62
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:30,139
after the flag was
hoisted on Lal Chovvk.

63
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,739
The army is on high alert.
There is patrolling everywhere.

64
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:37,278
The Begum has called me to
the mansion to repair the roof.

65
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,547
Thank God.

66
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:43,059
If the Begum is generous,
we'll make it through this winter.

67
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,190
Our houseboat is hardly
running this year.

68
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:49,994
Take this mister, too.

69
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:53,297
Let him know what it's like
to work for a living.

70
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:56,263
That'll get him in shape.

71
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,787
The Begum came from a princely family.

72
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:23,192
Pretty as an angel.

73
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:25,359
Her mother was from Lucknow.

74
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,098
There was a rumour many years ago

75
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:31,471
that spread like wild fire.

76
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:34,075
Someone cast an evil
eye on that family.

77
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:44,615
The Begum is a strict one.

78
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:48,385
She will not stand any misbehavior.

79
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,286
Concentrate on your work.

80
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:54,096
Keep an apology and
a greeting always handy.

81
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:57,067
If anyone asks,
present it immediately.

82
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,660
The city folk say that
the mansion is haunted.

83
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:04,040
Noora, be careful of the ghosts.

84
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:05,167
Junaid, tea?

85
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:26,277
Stop staring.

86
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,526
Firdaus, mother is waiting.

87
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:17,532
F-I-R-D-A-U-S

88
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,367
Firdaus.

89
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:11,253
Listen.

90
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,189
Mother has called you inside.

91
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,421
We'll be there in two minutes.

92
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:18,356
Not you. You may rest.

93
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,622
Only him.

94
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:38,205
My sling?

95
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:39,681
What?

96
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,149
Sling.

97
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:43,211
Forget about it.

98
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,516
Don't even think of telling anyone.

99
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:48,285
That'll be in your best interest.

100
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:51,284
You are so beautiful.

101
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:54,024
L-low did you learn to speak so sweetly?

102
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:58,095
Don't let your eyes wander

103
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:00,228
and your words will
automatically become sweet too.

104
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:07,200
What did you say his name is?

105
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:09,143
Noor.

106
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:11,511
Master Hoor, what do you do?

107
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:14,017
What can you do?

108
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:15,643
Not Hoor, it is Noor.

109
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,654
What do I need to do?

110
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:22,521
Damn, it always stops here.

111
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:30,191
Sing me something.

112
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:33,436
Something that will touch my soul.

113
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:36,302
I haven't cried since
a very long time.

114
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:43,330
Kashmiri Folk Song

115
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,593
Excellent, Firdaus.

116
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:04,363
Where did you find him?

117
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:09,637
Sir Noor Khan, aren't
you a little gem?

118
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:13,276
What else can you do?

119
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,978
Can you ride a horse?

120
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:18,379
What?

121
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:22,075
Do you at least know how
to tend to the horses'?

122
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:27,019
Mother, take a look at his shoes.

123
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,223
So from tomorrow, you will
look after our stables.

124
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:37,461
If you work diligently,
you will be rewarded well.

125
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:41,026
And don't think that
I'm offering you a job

126
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:43,573
because I'm impressed
with your singing.

127
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:48,372
Firdaus liked your shoes.

128
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:51,638
And I cannot say no to her.

129
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,348
Firdaus will have
someone to play with.

130
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:02,224
But you don't play
loose with your heart.

131
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:05,057
This is the age for you to have fun.

132
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:09,225
Save all your heartbreaks for later.

133
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:17,570
Take a token from
Kaleem on your way out.

134
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,738
You are now going to be
a part of this legacy.

135
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:26,539
Your honour is ours.

136
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:32,420
Wear something decent from tomorrow.

137
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:35,220
There is a world beyond shoes, sir.

138
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,358
I'll take your leave then.

139
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,766
Who knew that God had
His grace on this one?

140
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:51,336
Now, he'll finally be of some use.

141
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:53,706
You must do everything
to keep them happy.

142
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:55,244
Are you listening?

143
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,746
Don't do anything silly this time.

144
00:18:58,003 --> 00:19:01,280
Begum can change your
life if she wishes to.

145
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:26,406
With the soft threads of Pashmina

146
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:32,074
Someone spins her dreams

147
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:33,980
l-low so'?

148
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:38,385
The abundant hills echo

149
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:43,983
New songs, these instruments

150
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,992
l-low so'?

151
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:50,397
With the soft threads of Pashmina

152
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:56,095
The blossoms have just altered

153
00:19:56,495 --> 00:20:02,036
Their moods, feelings

154
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:04,043
l-low so'?

155
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:08,517
The eyes have revealed

156
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:14,183
New secrets, emotions

157
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:16,089
l-low so'?

158
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:20,324
With the soft threads of Pashmina

159
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:25,695
Someone spins her dreams

160
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,398
l-low so'?

161
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:57,326
It was the age of wisdom, it
was the age of foolishness.

162
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:00,529
It was the season of light,
it was the season of darkness.

163
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:01,696
It was the...

164
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:15,008
Delicate breeze blends
with the young smoke

165
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:21,046
The youthful heart seeks new moments

166
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:27,086
Tepid sunshine slips
on the untrodden paths

167
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:32,067
Somebody surreptitiously whispers

168
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,730
I will be your shadow

169
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:38,263
Walk behind you

170
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:42,301
Walk on with you

171
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:47,240
With the soft threads of Pashmina

172
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:53,252
Someone spins her dreams

173
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:56,293
l-low so'?

174
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:11,434
The abundant hills echo

175
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:16,002
New songs, these instruments

176
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:21,150
The Narangs are offering a
cut above the market price.

177
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:25,382
They want to turn this
mansion into a heritage hotel.

178
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:27,815
Tell me one thing, Zafar.

179
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,857
Has your father not
left you with anything?

180
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:34,619
You come here salivating every year.

181
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:42,233
Now please do me a favour and
get your sorry face out of here.

182
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:46,238
Sell it, sister.

183
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:48,702
The market situation is bleak.

184
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:51,247
Jagirdar, show them out.

185
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,576
The old woman has lost her head.

186
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:59,485
She has wasted more than
half her fortune on jewelry.

187
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,080
She should be sent to Tussauds.

188
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:02,181
They will take her as is.

189
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:03,225
Calm down, Sameera.

190
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:05,056
There is jack shit we can do.

191
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:18,997
14th October. 3:10 pm.

192
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:23,044
Remember the day and time.

193
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:27,073
I made you my friend today.

194
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:31,521
It's my birthday next week.

195
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,351
You have to come.

196
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,447
Don't forget.

197
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,654
Stop staring, Noor. It's bad manners.

198
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,045
Did he like it?

199
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,210
Yes, mother.

200
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:08,489
I saw him.

201
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:11,085
He couldn't let go of it.

202
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:13,527
I have invited him on Sunday.

203
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,590
Dear, at this rate the
world will come to an end

204
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:47,653
and you still won't know what to wear.

205
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,357
And anyway, if Rukhsar figures out,

206
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:53,164
who knows what she will do to us.

207
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:56,669
You are really scared
of her, aren't you?

208
00:24:57,362 --> 00:24:59,433
You can't hurry these things.

209
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:02,969
It's Firdaus' birthday.

210
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:04,672
Not your regular local fair.

211
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:09,017
Sure, I'm looking good?

212
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:10,178
Yes, like a prince.

213
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:11,312
Noor!

214
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,385
There now, sister has
seen my outfit too.

215
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:10,964
Prayer for the departed.

216
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:45,340
Firdaus!

217
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:53,683
Firdaus!

218
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:55,782
You've come now?

219
00:26:57,315 --> 00:27:00,023
The birthday was yesterday.

220
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:04,032
Firdaus will now wait for
you on her next birthday.

221
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:05,664
Where is Firdaus?

222
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:10,366
Firdaus.

223
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:20,279
If there is a heaven on
earth, it is here. It is here.

224
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:29,087
These are cruel times.

225
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:33,387
Everyone wants a piece of this heaven.

226
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:37,156
I've sent Firdaus to school in London.

227
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,629
This is no place for
her to grow up in.

228
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:44,070
Bombs go off anywhere.

229
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:46,541
She was choking here.

230
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:53,139
Now you catch your breath too.

231
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:58,654
Don't believe what your eyes see.

232
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:04,093
Listen to your heart, Noor.

233
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,396
But now it isn't yours anymore.

234
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,335
You have given it away.

235
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:15,961
I told you not to.

236
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:24,578
It broke, didn't it?

237
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:31,348
Love is not simple, Noor.

238
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:36,453
You will either sink or swim.

239
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:45,465
You have to become someone
to be deserving of Firdaus.

240
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:48,094
It's not so easy to enter her world.

241
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,298
You will have to give it your all.

242
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:52,102
You are no longer a child.

243
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:54,507
Stop crying and go home.

244
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:57,604
The situation here is
getting from bad to worse.

245
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:00,214
Stay alive, Noor.

246
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:02,948
You are no use, dead.

247
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:06,950
Neither to Firdaus, nor to me.

248
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:28,643
And just like that,
everything came to an end.

249
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:34,083
Begum's words kept
swirling around in my head.

250
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:37,317
As though a chasm
opened up inside of me

251
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:40,288
and I kept falling, deep down.

252
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:43,090
A deep black chasm.

253
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:47,529
So dark that even my
screams were dying inside.

254
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:17,558
Days turned to months
and months to years.

255
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:20,118
I couldn't get her out of my heart.

256
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:25,333
But I could at least look for her

257
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:28,166
in every living spark,
in every dying ember.

258
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:30,697
She, who was not anywhere.

259
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:33,272
She, who was everywhere.

260
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:35,744
Finish the rest tomorrow.

261
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:38,304
Let's go get dinner.

262
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,314
I will sleep in the shed tonight.

263
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:57,157
Jiju?

264
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:06,238
I told Junaid so many times.

265
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:10,404
I even sent the art books with Kaleem.

266
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:14,583
You didn't even come to meet me once.

267
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:19,749
I got busy with work in the shop.

268
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:33,327
So much pain.

269
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:38,333
L-low do you bring so
much pain in your art'?

270
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:43,678
I recognized you the
minute I laid eyes on you.

271
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:46,614
I've pared a lot of jewels in my time.

272
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:11,529
Today is an auspicious day.

273
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:16,274
I would like the good fortune

274
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:20,282
of being your first patron.

275
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:28,755
It is your first earning. Savour it.

276
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:33,154
Your new life starts from today.

277
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:36,689
God bless you.

278
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:46,031
Any news of Firdaus, Begum?

279
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:55,113
You may want to ask
on me too, sometime.

280
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:58,687
Firdaus is in Delhi.

281
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:01,019
She was asking about you.

282
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:05,721
Good thing we met.

283
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:09,091
Now there's lots to tell her.

284
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:24,242
Nooruddin Nizami.

285
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:25,508
Age - 23 years.

286
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:27,311
There is good news.

287
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:30,785
He has been chosen for an
Arts Scholarship.

288
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:32,710
'Art for Freedom'.

289
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:35,155
They are promoting young artists.

290
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:38,285
In short, his life is about to change.

291
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:42,763
There is a small clause.

292
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:46,468
He will have to go to Delhi
and join a residency program.

293
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:49,061
He'll get an allowance every month.

294
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:52,802
All expenses like food and stay
will be borne by my client.

295
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:56,607
Your client?
Is it the Begum?

296
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:58,578
Clause 5.

297
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:01,276
I do not have the liberty to
disclose the name.

298
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:05,317
My client wants his training
to start as soon as possible.

299
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,387
Why me?

300
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,720
Why was I chosen?

301
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:15,063
Think of it as God's grace.

302
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,157
What we know as 'Lady Luck'

303
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:21,402
or 'Kismet'.

304
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,071
See you in Delhi, then.

305
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:33,648
But Jun-jiju, I can't just leave you.

306
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:38,414
There is nothing left here, child.

307
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:41,719
You'll just rot sitting here.

308
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:46,252
The one above is
paving the way for you.

309
00:34:47,318 --> 00:34:49,355
Don't fight Him anymore.

310
00:34:57,662 --> 00:35:00,438
If there is heaven on earth

311
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:03,035
It is here, it is here

312
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:06,014
My life, my soul, my
heart are committed

313
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:10,143
It is here, it is here

314
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:22,494
Jun-jiju's prayers worked for me.

315
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:27,297
Whether it was God's mercy
or Begum's largesse.

316
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:29,736
But I'd found my purpose.

317
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:35,410
As though the world
was calling out to me.

318
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,207
It was extending its arms.

319
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:39,009
Go, embrace it.

320
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:56,688
I have spoken to the landlord.

321
00:35:56,754 --> 00:35:59,667
He already has one
year's rent in advance.

322
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:13,445
Your residency starts tomorrow.

323
00:36:14,038 --> 00:36:18,487
Leena Becker, who is a renowned
curator, will be in charge of you.

324
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:21,214
She will explain the rest.

325
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,624
Alright?

326
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,060
Yes.

327
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:01,294
Good morning!

328
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:05,100
Sorry for all the noise last night.

329
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:06,396
Some breakfast?

330
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,162
Noor, right?

331
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:14,039
Arif Peerbhoy. Come, join us.

332
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:18,677
Jagirdar had said you would be coming.

333
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,115
Please have a seat.

334
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:26,217
So, artist, huh?

335
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:29,089
I dabble a bit in it myself.

336
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:31,558
I have a small collection.
Mostly new guys.

337
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,020
What are you working on currently?

338
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,530
I am still searching.

339
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:36,587
<i>For?</i>

340
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:37,632
Myself.

341
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:39,330
Not bad.

342
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,165
So, full on exploration
happening, huh?

343
00:37:41,225 --> 00:37:43,227
You are from Kashmir, isn't it?

344
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:46,370
Begum Hazrat Jaan is my aunt.

345
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:51,402
Tell me, what is the equation
between you and the Begum?

346
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:52,641
She is a piece of work.

347
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:54,614
Be careful of her.

348
00:37:57,141 --> 00:37:59,212
Anyway, the room on top is also mine.

349
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,654
You can work here in peace.

350
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:02,088
It's an open house.
Feel free.

351
00:38:02,146 --> 00:38:04,490
I'm going to cancel my yoga today.

352
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:07,324
I can't do it. Just can't.

353
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:12,027
So do you come to Kashmir often?

354
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:14,964
Who will go to that haunted house?

355
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:17,165
She's cut off all links with family.

356
00:38:18,396 --> 00:38:22,503
Tell me something,
how can someone live so alone'?

357
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:25,473
It is not so simple to understand her.

358
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:29,344
I have seen her heart.
She does quite a lot for others.

359
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:32,048
You mean for you?

360
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:35,724
I am just messing with you.

361
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,625
So, what is the plan for today?

362
00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:39,662
I have a meeting with Leena Becker.

363
00:38:40,217 --> 00:38:41,287
LBG Gallery.

364
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:42,997
Not bad.

365
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:44,294
Home-run right on arrival.

366
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,537
Have you settled in?
- Yes.

367
00:38:51,595 --> 00:38:54,337
Did you like the studio?
- Yes.

368
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:57,470
I saw the pictures you sent.

369
00:38:57,535 --> 00:38:59,378
They are somewhat interesting.

370
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:02,642
But your work needs presentation.

371
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:06,553
It needs scale.
And, it needs context.

372
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,453
And that is where we come in.

373
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:11,992
The India Art Summit
will take place next month.

374
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:15,053
And your first piece of work
will be exhibited there.

375
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,496
This is your space.

376
00:39:18,222 --> 00:39:20,668
Fill it up.
You have six weeks.

377
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:24,964
Nervous?

378
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:27,367
Good!

379
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:30,509
People really sweat it
out to reach here, Noor.

380
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:34,274
From here on,
there are no shortcuts.

381
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:40,316
Don't worry, it will
all fall into place.

382
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,584
Okay?

383
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:43,147
Welcome to Delhi.

384
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:44,651
Good luck!

385
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,286
Leena's a tough cookie, no?

386
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:49,656
The gallery was a
real eye-opener, man.

387
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:51,656
I am feeling a tad scared.

388
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:54,395
Let's see. We'll do something.

389
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:56,131
That's the shit, man!

390
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:58,104
Show them vvhafs inside.

391
00:39:58,529 --> 00:39:59,701
To the future.

392
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:10,281
Hey, what's up?
Hovv are you, man?

393
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:08,138
Firdaus!

394
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:34,059
By the way, have you met
Leena's new boy?

395
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:37,662
Just come in from Srinagar.

396
00:41:37,728 --> 00:41:39,639
Go say hi to him.

397
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:49,684
Sir Noor Khan.

398
00:41:50,774 --> 00:41:52,651
Rising star!

399
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,286
How's Delhi treating you, love?

400
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:01,495
Stop staring, Noor.

401
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:04,159
L-low old are you'?

402
00:42:05,222 --> 00:42:07,498
Hi babes, let's go!

403
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:09,636
Coming.

404
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:35,353
There was so much
that I wanted to ask her.

405
00:42:35,419 --> 00:42:38,093
So many whys, whats, whens

406
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:42,468
things I'd buried
inside all these years

407
00:42:42,526 --> 00:42:45,097
they all flowed out as love.

408
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:47,572
Firdaus.

409
00:42:48,465 --> 00:42:50,308
I had met my match.

410
00:42:58,509 --> 00:42:59,817
You guys are mad.

411
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:02,183
Bye!

412
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:18,198
Mother mentioned that
you were going to come.

413
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:22,608
She especially told me to,
'Take care of Noor'.

414
00:43:26,403 --> 00:43:29,009
So, you finally got here.

415
00:43:29,073 --> 00:43:31,053
Half my life has gone by.

416
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:33,213
If not now, then when?

417
00:43:35,512 --> 00:43:37,287
You are just the same.

418
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:40,250
So...

419
00:43:41,251 --> 00:43:43,288
when are you exhibiting?

420
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:44,389
Next month.

421
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:50,736
I'll come for it.

422
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:54,202
Your honour is ours.

423
00:43:58,435 --> 00:44:00,210
So then, how do you like it'?

424
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:03,684
Very beautiful.

425
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:05,710
<i>Fwdaus Jean NaqvL.</i>

426
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:08,183
London School of Design.

427
00:44:08,445 --> 00:44:12,188
Looking at you, even I learned
to make a sketch or two.

428
00:44:13,617 --> 00:44:16,120
Did you get those sketches
I sent every year?

429
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:20,628
Sir Noor Khan, I have a boyfriend now.

430
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:25,133
The ring should be here any day now.

431
00:44:26,296 --> 00:44:28,401
Noor, where the hell are you?

432
00:44:28,465 --> 00:44:30,706
I've been looking all over for you.

433
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:33,514
Calm down, Arif.

434
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:35,015
Let's get you another drink.

435
00:44:35,072 --> 00:44:36,346
Q Kay-

436
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:08,173
Life has conspired

437
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:13,278
Our work is about our
dreams and desires.

438
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:15,345
It's what you make other people see.

439
00:45:15,412 --> 00:45:17,323
I hope you enjoy the show.

440
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:20,526
So when are you exhibiting your work?

441
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:22,063
Yes... er...

442
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:25,432
In a few weeks.
His work is beautiful.

443
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:29,197
Hello.

444
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:30,738
Are you stalking me?

445
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:33,408
Up, here.

446
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:44,347
My obsession has brought
me close to you

447
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:53,158
My obsession is your mercy

448
00:45:53,283 --> 00:46:01,998
My obsession changed my destiny

449
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:09,307
Your love is my obsession

450
00:46:09,366 --> 00:46:15,009
O my Lord!

451
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:41,170
My desires were burning slowly

452
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:48,648
Wishes buried deep in
my heart were stifling

453
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:55,318
Carried through to you in a smolder

454
00:46:55,379 --> 00:46:59,657
O my Lord!

455
00:46:59,716 --> 00:47:03,994
I have scratched the
threshold of madness

456
00:47:04,054 --> 00:47:07,092
O my Lord!

457
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:16,173
My obsession has
brought me close to you

458
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:25,317
My obsession has
brought me close to you

459
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:34,259
My obsession is your mercy

460
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:42,668
My obsession changed my destiny

461
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:50,441
Your love is my obsession

462
00:47:51,468 --> 00:47:53,778
O my Lord!

463
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:55,642
Like it?

464
00:48:07,184 --> 00:48:09,323
And now for our show-stopper
of the evening,

465
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:11,491
the 'Freedom for Art' series.

466
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:14,729
Feast your eyes guys.
It's all been sold.

467
00:48:15,259 --> 00:48:19,002
Presenting the man of the hour,
Noor Nizami.

468
00:48:22,332 --> 00:48:24,039
What is the story behind this?

469
00:48:24,101 --> 00:48:27,082
Is this your idea of
present day Kashmir?

470
00:48:27,337 --> 00:48:29,749
It just hurt and I poured it out.

471
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:33,548
You cannot see art and
politics separately.

472
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:37,683
Speaking of politics,
what is your take on the ground reality?

473
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:39,728
Do you also want freedom?

474
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:43,420
Isn't this much freedom enough?

475
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:47,063
I am alive. Breathing.

476
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:50,568
Standing here, amidst
all you fine people.

477
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:10,722
I will only say, that to me,
Kashmir will always be the same.

478
00:49:11,982 --> 00:49:13,484
Pure.

479
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:15,086
Beautiful.

480
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:16,654
Soulful.

481
00:49:18,555 --> 00:49:19,693
I may be cursed like that.

482
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:23,302
That the heart yearns for
what once was.

483
00:49:24,728 --> 00:49:27,470
Those sweet fragrant days of my past.

484
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:46,726
L-low do you like it'?

485
00:49:49,586 --> 00:49:50,621
Very beautiful!

486
00:49:58,462 --> 00:50:00,203
You are looking smart.

487
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:03,578
Be wary of other girls.

488
00:50:11,274 --> 00:50:12,651
You should've let me drive, sis.

489
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:14,586
You drive like a girl, Arif.

490
00:50:14,644 --> 00:50:17,386
Why drink more than you can handle?

491
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:40,708
I am getting engaged.

492
00:50:42,105 --> 00:50:43,311
I told you.

493
00:50:44,641 --> 00:50:47,349
Don't you ever listen?

494
00:50:49,312 --> 00:50:52,259
Bilal and I were together at
college in London.

495
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:57,223
His father was a Minister
in the Pakistan government.

496
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:00,095
Now Bilal is next in line.

497
00:51:05,162 --> 00:51:07,369
Don't you get scared of anything?

498
00:51:08,632 --> 00:51:10,305
I do.

499
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:13,476
I am scared that you
will go away again.

500
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:20,354
But this time it won't be easy.

501
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:22,615
We'll have to wage war.

502
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:27,024
They already lost
the '65 and '71 wars.

503
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:29,697
Even the one in '99.

504
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:33,762
Has his visa come in?

505
00:51:38,295 --> 00:51:39,330
Idiot!

506
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:51,785
Greetings, mother.

507
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:54,079
My dear child.

508
00:51:54,144 --> 00:51:56,090
L-low are things'?

509
00:51:56,146 --> 00:51:58,217
You didn't call yesterday.

510
00:51:59,049 --> 00:52:00,687
Yes, I forgot.

511
00:52:02,152 --> 00:52:04,564
Besides, there's nothing much
to report everyday.

512
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:07,465
There must be something... surely.

513
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,398
Did you meet Noor?

514
00:52:12,596 --> 00:52:14,542
Did you go for the exhibition?

515
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:15,542
Yes, mother.

516
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:19,112
He couldn't stay away, could he?

517
00:52:19,169 --> 00:52:22,082
So, how did you find him'?

518
00:52:22,739 --> 00:52:24,275
He's sweet.

519
00:52:24,674 --> 00:52:26,176
He keeps hovering around.

520
00:52:28,411 --> 00:52:30,391
Keep him behind you.

521
00:52:32,082 --> 00:52:34,494
Everything ahead has been decided.

522
00:52:34,551 --> 00:52:37,589
As for the rest, you are smart enough.

523
00:52:55,472 --> 00:52:59,045
I wouldn't have recognized you
if I saw you like this the first time.

524
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:19,230
Don't!

525
00:53:23,433 --> 00:53:26,277
I have captured you,
Firdaus Jaan Naqvi.

526
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:29,213
I thought you would set me free.

527
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,077
You, too?

528
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:36,291
Only death can free you from yourself.

529
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:43,220
Or love.

530
00:54:32,669 --> 00:54:40,349
My desires were burning slowly

531
00:54:41,511 --> 00:54:48,019
Wishes buried deep in
my heart were stifling

532
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:54,530
Carried through to you in a smolder

533
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:58,800
O my Lord!

534
00:54:59,229 --> 00:55:03,200
I have scratched the
threshold of madness

535
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:06,247
O my Lord!

536
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,676
Mr. Frost, how are you'?

537
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:13,177
Good.

538
00:55:13,276 --> 00:55:14,516
Your consignment is on its way.

539
00:55:14,611 --> 00:55:16,249
It'll be with you Tuesday morning.

540
00:55:16,346 --> 00:55:18,087
Your client's gonna love it.

541
00:55:39,703 --> 00:55:43,048
The first thing a man does when he
comes to the city is to buy a home.

542
00:55:43,139 --> 00:55:44,550
Such an expensive car?

543
00:55:44,641 --> 00:55:47,019
And that too a secondhand one?

544
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:49,181
You sure, man?

545
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:55,719
Sure as the day I was born.

546
00:55:57,754 --> 00:56:06,105
My obsession has
brought me close to you

547
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:15,244
My obsession is your mercy

548
00:56:15,505 --> 00:56:22,719
Your love is my obsession

549
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:25,719
O my Lord!

550
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,731
Where are we going?

551
00:56:37,026 --> 00:56:40,667
Back in time.
To a time unknown.

552
00:56:44,267 --> 00:56:46,770
It was the best of times.
It was the worst of times.

553
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:50,244
It was the age of wisdom.
It was the age of foolishness.

554
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:53,344
It was...

555
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:57,583
I gave you the book to read,
not to memorise.

556
00:57:38,188 --> 00:57:38,757
- Noor!

557
00:57:39,022 --> 00:57:40,695
Yes, Leena. - Since when
I've been trying to reach you.

558
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:43,334
You are going to exhibit at Hayvvorth!

559
00:57:43,426 --> 00:57:44,234
Yes?

560
00:57:44,494 --> 00:57:45,632
Pack your bags, my friend.

561
00:57:45,728 --> 00:57:47,639
We're off to London.
Congratulations, Noor!

562
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:48,731
Thank you.

563
00:57:49,032 --> 00:57:50,477
This is a big one.

564
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:51,477
Bye.

565
00:57:58,441 --> 00:58:00,011
It was Leena.

566
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:03,146
There is a mail from the
London organisers.

567
00:58:03,246 --> 00:58:05,487
My work has been
selected for Hayworth.

568
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:08,260
Come here.

569
00:58:13,556 --> 00:58:15,365
Congratulations!

570
00:58:16,392 --> 00:58:18,565
I am really happy for you.

571
00:58:19,229 --> 00:58:20,173
What the hell are you doing?

572
00:58:20,263 --> 00:58:21,674
You arrived just yesterday.

573
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,008
From Kashmir to Delhi.

574
00:58:24,067 --> 00:58:26,445
Delhi to London.
This guy is amazing.

575
00:58:26,536 --> 00:58:28,174
You are everywhere, bro.

576
00:58:30,974 --> 00:58:32,248
Cheers to Noor!

577
00:58:40,984 --> 00:58:43,396
Congratulations, Noor. All the best!

578
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:22,535
Firdaus, the first time I saw you,
my head just exploded.

579
00:59:26,296 --> 00:59:28,003
Let me speak.

580
00:59:28,097 --> 00:59:33,103
This is my time, this is my place.

581
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:36,710
Do you know, Firdaus

582
00:59:37,006 --> 00:59:40,044
I remember each and
everything about you.

583
00:59:41,511 --> 00:59:45,516
Your scarf. Your books.

584
00:59:51,154 --> 00:59:53,600
That long snake-like car.

585
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:58,299
<i>The red o? the Owner tree.</i>

586
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:02,004
All those moments that I've lived
every waking day.

587
01:00:02,732 --> 01:00:07,181
'A/Vhdd have thought that
we'd meet like this years later'?

588
01:00:08,204 --> 01:00:10,309
That we would be sitting here?

589
01:00:10,673 --> 01:00:12,414
Your mother kept telling me...

590
01:00:12,508 --> 01:00:13,509
Shh...

591
01:00:15,745 --> 01:00:17,418
I love this song.

592
01:02:58,508 --> 01:03:02,115
No, I have to go.

593
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:26,062
I love you!

594
01:05:33,362 --> 01:05:35,364
I don't believe you.

595
01:05:35,731 --> 01:05:37,711
You still have it?

596
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:40,637
You are crazy!

597
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:43,417
What's so crazy about it?

598
01:05:43,506 --> 01:05:45,417
It's my prized possession.

599
01:05:46,409 --> 01:05:48,252
Like how you have your jewels.

600
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:55,554
We were young then, Noor.

601
01:06:08,731 --> 01:06:09,971
Yes.

602
01:06:10,066 --> 01:06:16,073
Does it matter to you
if I'm alive or dead, Firdaus?

603
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:19,479
Just tell me, what's the matter?

604
01:06:20,609 --> 01:06:22,611
I'm dying out here! Nothing else.

605
01:06:23,512 --> 01:06:26,322
The veins in my throat are bursting
from this terrible cough.

606
01:06:29,418 --> 01:06:31,364
I'll come in a day or two.

607
01:06:31,454 --> 01:06:34,128
Why don't you come
directly to my funeral?

608
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:37,201
Are you a six year old'?

609
01:06:37,526 --> 01:06:39,164
I'll be there soon.

610
01:06:48,337 --> 01:06:49,475
Who was it?

611
01:06:50,206 --> 01:06:51,116
Work call.

612
01:06:51,207 --> 01:06:52,447
I have to go.

613
01:06:54,043 --> 01:06:55,044
Now?

614
01:07:10,259 --> 01:07:12,034
Is everything okay?

615
01:07:14,597 --> 01:07:15,575
Bye.

616
01:07:22,171 --> 01:07:23,616
When will we meet next?

617
01:07:27,076 --> 01:07:28,350
I'll call you.

618
01:07:35,418 --> 01:07:37,625
She's a lucky girl, Noor.

619
01:07:39,622 --> 01:07:42,102
She's totally going to love it.

620
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:49,031
I'm heading out, Noor.

621
01:07:49,131 --> 01:07:51,202
There's a letter for you.
I'm keeping it here.

622
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:52,244
Yes. Bye!

623
01:07:52,301 --> 01:07:53,279
Bye!

624
01:08:04,713 --> 01:08:07,660
Noor, I'm leaving.

625
01:08:08,617 --> 01:08:10,597
Actually, I've had to leave.

626
01:08:11,187 --> 01:08:12,598
Don't know when we will meet again.

627
01:08:13,289 --> 01:08:15,462
Or then, why did we
have to meet at all?

628
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:21,037
All I know is that, I'll always
cherish this time I spent with you.

629
01:08:22,531 --> 01:08:24,477
And yes, mother was asking about you.

630
01:08:25,034 --> 01:08:27,412
I lied to her that you have grown up.

631
01:08:28,971 --> 01:08:30,541
Will we ever grow up, Noor?

632
01:08:32,007 --> 01:08:34,283
Some things we cannot change
ho matter how hard we try.

633
01:08:34,543 --> 01:08:37,547
And if they do,
we can't remain happy.

634
01:08:39,248 --> 01:08:41,524
I will pray for you, Noor.

635
01:08:42,318 --> 01:08:43,763
You're better than the best.

636
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:46,262
Give it your all.

637
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:48,295
Dazzle them with your shine.

638
01:08:48,557 --> 01:08:50,298
Your time is here.

639
01:08:51,193 --> 01:08:52,672
Goodbye, Noor!

640
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:55,571
We will meet again... if life permits.

641
01:09:25,393 --> 01:09:26,167
Hello.

642
01:09:26,460 --> 01:09:28,565
Noor. .. my dear!

643
01:09:29,096 --> 01:09:32,771
Imagine, I had to hear from Jagirdar
that you have come to Srinagar.

644
01:09:32,867 --> 01:09:33,845
When are you coming home?

645
01:09:33,934 --> 01:09:36,813
In a bit, I just have something
to take care of.

646
01:09:36,904 --> 01:09:39,145
Alright.
I'll see you in the evening.

647
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:42,910
I want to hear all about the city.
Come quickly.

648
01:09:43,010 --> 01:09:45,047
Yes, Jun-jiju. I'll be there.

649
01:10:07,635 --> 01:10:09,137
Who's there?

650
01:10:10,070 --> 01:10:11,606
Who is it?

651
01:10:14,775 --> 01:10:15,947
Noor!

652
01:10:16,710 --> 01:10:17,688
Greetings.

653
01:10:19,013 --> 01:10:20,993
I thought as much.

654
01:10:21,415 --> 01:10:25,727
Got homesick so soon in the city?

655
01:10:25,820 --> 01:10:29,165
I was on my way home.
Thought I'd drop in to see you.

656
01:10:31,125 --> 01:10:34,538
Oh, so His Highness has come
to see the Begum.

657
01:10:45,039 --> 01:10:46,746
Did you meet Firdaus?

658
01:10:48,609 --> 01:10:49,917
What did you think of her?

659
01:10:51,011 --> 01:10:53,548
Isn't she precious?

660
01:10:53,647 --> 01:10:54,990
Noor's little princess.

661
01:10:57,885 --> 01:11:00,058
You've come to meet her,
haven't you?

662
01:11:02,590 --> 01:11:03,933
Call out to her.

663
01:11:06,994 --> 01:11:08,132
Call her.

664
01:11:12,399 --> 01:11:13,139
Call her.

665
01:11:18,672 --> 01:11:19,844
Firdaus!

666
01:11:21,442 --> 01:11:22,512
Firdaus!

667
01:11:22,610 --> 01:11:24,556
Careful, Noor.

668
01:11:25,913 --> 01:11:27,483
Bilal is coming.

669
01:11:30,885 --> 01:11:34,833
It's her own choice.
What could I've done?

670
01:11:35,890 --> 01:11:38,530
Hi, Noor. Hovv are you?

671
01:11:38,993 --> 01:11:41,166
When did you get here?

672
01:11:41,462 --> 01:11:43,738
I'll catch up with you in a while.

673
01:11:45,799 --> 01:11:49,906
Come on mother.
It's peak afternoon.

674
01:11:50,004 --> 01:11:52,883
The doctor has asked you to rest.

675
01:11:52,973 --> 01:11:55,817
You came away just like that, Firdaus!

676
01:11:55,910 --> 01:11:59,585
I had to. That's how it is.

677
01:12:00,881 --> 01:12:05,455
Life goes on...
doesn't stop for anyone.

678
01:12:10,457 --> 01:12:12,562
But that's not done.

679
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:15,504
One moment you blow hot,
the other, cold.

680
01:12:17,064 --> 01:12:18,702
What's your problem, Noor?

681
01:12:18,799 --> 01:12:20,779
Why have you come after me?

682
01:12:21,368 --> 01:12:22,972
What have you come to see?

683
01:12:23,537 --> 01:12:25,847
Did I tell you to follow me
for the rest of your life?

684
01:12:25,940 --> 01:12:27,078
You are just too much!

685
01:12:29,443 --> 01:12:33,084
Mother, you need to stop smoking
that damn hookah.

686
01:12:33,514 --> 01:12:35,790
L-low will the medicines work'?

687
01:12:37,718 --> 01:12:41,632
These merciless medicines
don't let me die easily.

688
01:12:42,890 --> 01:12:45,427
Maybe opium will help.

689
01:12:50,397 --> 01:12:53,435
Noor, what will you do now?

690
01:12:53,667 --> 01:12:55,544
Are you going home?

691
01:12:56,804 --> 01:12:59,614
If you are, do me a favor.

692
01:12:59,707 --> 01:13:03,849
I owe Junaid some money
from last winter.

693
01:13:03,944 --> 01:13:06,083
Some two thousand three hundred.

694
01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:08,126
Take it from Kaleem on your way out.

695
01:13:08,415 --> 01:13:09,860
Move. - Yes.

696
01:13:22,529 --> 01:13:26,477
Begum clenched her fist and it
was almost as if time stopped.

697
01:13:28,469 --> 01:13:30,949
What was I being punished for?

698
01:13:31,038 --> 01:13:33,814
Who had snuffed out all love
from this house?

699
01:13:37,444 --> 01:13:40,391
Whose story were we reliving?

700
01:14:01,869 --> 01:14:05,009
This smell of yours
will drive me crazy.

701
01:14:05,105 --> 01:14:08,143
Enough! You'll jinx us now.

702
01:14:08,442 --> 01:14:10,149
Now hurry up and
show some of your magic

703
01:14:10,411 --> 01:14:13,483
or somebody will steal
this fragrance away.

704
01:14:21,455 --> 01:14:23,901
Look at this emerald.

705
01:14:25,025 --> 01:14:27,801
It'll look so lovely on you.

706
01:14:28,796 --> 01:14:31,970
Lord, hovv beautiful!

707
01:14:32,066 --> 01:14:35,604
Salman, how long are you here for'?

708
01:14:35,703 --> 01:14:39,116
Father wanted to stay, but
he had to leave for the elections.

709
01:14:39,406 --> 01:14:43,479
I leave for London on Sunday
and from there to Islamabad.

710
01:14:43,977 --> 01:14:47,015
I would like to take Hazrat to London
for the trousseau shopping.

711
01:14:48,015 --> 01:14:50,621
Why don't you ask her yourself?

712
01:14:50,718 --> 01:14:53,460
Hazrat is too much of a free bird.

713
01:14:57,991 --> 01:15:00,597
L-low long will we Keep
meeting this way, Mufti'?

714
01:15:01,628 --> 01:15:04,632
Who all will we lie to?

715
01:15:06,133 --> 01:15:10,878
I'm constantly worried
about getting caught.

716
01:15:15,876 --> 01:15:20,916
Things are tough, I know.
But we can't give up hope.

717
01:15:21,014 --> 01:15:25,827
Nobody can stop us
from getting married, Hazrat.

718
01:15:34,728 --> 01:15:39,473
- Hazrat will understand and
appreciate our choices.

719
01:15:40,667 --> 01:15:43,079
- Besides, she'll not be far away.

720
01:15:43,370 --> 01:15:46,817
- We'll get her married, but
how will you manage without her'?

721
01:15:46,907 --> 01:15:51,788
- Salman will care for
her like a princess.

722
01:15:51,879 --> 01:15:54,758
- We shouldn't delay
the marriage ceremony any more.

723
01:16:04,124 --> 01:16:05,569
Mufti!

724
01:16:07,394 --> 01:16:08,134
Mufti!

725
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:15,603
Take care of this.

726
01:17:18,732 --> 01:17:19,642
Ticket.

727
01:17:30,878 --> 01:17:33,358
I'll get water. You wait here.

728
01:17:38,518 --> 01:17:40,555
Excuse me, my wife is sitting there...

729
01:17:40,654 --> 01:17:41,655
Please watch out for her,
I'll just go get some water.

730
01:17:41,755 --> 01:17:42,859
Sure.

731
01:18:22,663 --> 01:18:23,607
Mufti!

732
01:18:26,633 --> 01:18:27,577
Mufti!

733
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:47,558
Hello.

734
01:19:47,981 --> 01:19:49,619
What date is it today, Noor?

735
01:19:49,716 --> 01:19:51,024
I need some more time, Leena
I'm working on it.

736
01:19:51,118 --> 01:19:52,495
The auction is in three days.

737
01:19:52,586 --> 01:19:53,894
Show me something.

738
01:19:53,987 --> 01:19:55,830
I'll call you when
I have something to show.

739
01:19:55,922 --> 01:19:57,868
Noor, it's one of
Delhi's top art events...

740
01:20:20,580 --> 01:20:22,560
Why don't you answer it?

741
01:20:22,649 --> 01:20:24,560
Somebody is really
desperate out there.

742
01:20:26,620 --> 01:20:28,725
It's been growling all day long.

743
01:20:29,756 --> 01:20:31,997
Don't talk nonsense.

744
01:20:32,092 --> 01:20:34,834
Just help me out. It's stuck.

745
01:20:36,596 --> 01:20:38,940
Who got stuck on you now?

746
01:20:39,966 --> 01:20:44,005
Mr. Minister,
do I smell something burning?

747
01:20:45,872 --> 01:20:49,115
For sure! Just look at you.

748
01:20:49,810 --> 01:20:51,847
You're the prettiest girl
in the world tonight.

749
01:20:52,479 --> 01:20:54,686
Someone's heart must
surely be burning.

750
01:20:54,781 --> 01:20:59,423
Thank you, sire. That was
such a backhanded compliment.

751
01:21:01,721 --> 01:21:03,826
Now shall we get about
the rest of the evening?

752
01:21:03,924 --> 01:21:05,926
Everyone is waiting.

753
01:21:07,527 --> 01:21:10,007
Boundaries can separate countries,

754
01:21:10,097 --> 01:21:14,978
but they can't separate
our language, customs and traditions.

755
01:21:16,002 --> 01:21:17,913
We live in each other's hearts.

756
01:21:18,538 --> 01:21:22,918
And it's time now to welcome
each other in our homes.

757
01:21:23,009 --> 01:21:25,512
To embrace each
other whole-heartedly.

758
01:21:26,847 --> 01:21:32,490
We enjoy your food,
you enjoy our ghazals.

759
01:21:33,453 --> 01:21:35,694
The circle of bonhomie will
only prosper.

760
01:21:36,957 --> 01:21:38,493
Just one last request.

761
01:21:39,659 --> 01:21:42,003
It's been 25 years since
the cricket match...

762
01:21:43,396 --> 01:21:46,570
please forgive Javed Ivliandad
for socking it to you.

763
01:21:49,836 --> 01:21:52,749
- And that was Bilal Latif,
the young and dynamic minister

764
01:21:52,839 --> 01:21:55,080
- from Pakistan speaking at the
lndo-Pak cultural summit - Roots.

765
01:21:55,175 --> 01:21:55,915
Please sit.

766
01:21:55,976 --> 01:21:56,920
Father...

767
01:21:57,110 --> 01:21:59,750
Mr. Shaikh, looking very good.

768
01:21:59,846 --> 01:22:02,087
Looks like India has grown on you.

769
01:22:02,649 --> 01:22:03,559
L-low are you, my clear'?

770
01:22:03,650 --> 01:22:04,890
I'm fine.

771
01:22:04,985 --> 01:22:06,828
Mother wants to speak to you.

772
01:22:09,556 --> 01:22:14,130
Hazrat! This is not done.
You shoulcfve come.

773
01:22:14,427 --> 01:22:17,806
We've shut down parliament
to come here... and you...

774
01:22:18,932 --> 01:22:21,469
l-low many times will you disappoint me'?

775
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:24,378
When will I get a chance to host you?

776
01:22:24,471 --> 01:22:29,420
Salman, you are our guests.

777
01:22:30,076 --> 01:22:32,716
In fact, we are the ones
who must do the hosting.

778
01:22:32,812 --> 01:22:35,918
No one can win with
you in words, Hazrat.

779
01:22:36,149 --> 01:22:40,723
Anyway, we shall settle with
your dearest jewel.

780
01:22:41,421 --> 01:22:43,901
Our Firdaus is looking like an angel.

781
01:22:43,990 --> 01:22:46,800
We should not delay
the marriage ceremony any more.

782
01:22:47,928 --> 01:22:49,737
Three crores in the center of the room

783
01:22:49,829 --> 01:22:50,773
with the gentleman...

784
01:22:50,830 --> 01:22:54,471
we have Shahzia Sikandafis
The World is Yours, The World is Mine

785
01:22:54,568 --> 01:22:55,672
at three crores.

786
01:22:55,769 --> 01:22:58,750
Fair warning, if we are all done,
I will sell.

787
01:22:58,838 --> 01:22:59,908
And... sold!

788
01:23:01,575 --> 01:23:02,883
May I have your paddle number, sir?

789
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:09,156
Slow down. We're up next.

790
01:23:10,417 --> 01:23:11,794
And now, ladies and gentlemen

791
01:23:11,885 --> 01:23:13,523
moving on to our next lot.

792
01:23:13,620 --> 01:23:18,000
Lot number 21, is by a new
upcoming Indian artist.

793
01:23:18,091 --> 01:23:20,037
His name is Noor Nizami.

794
01:23:20,126 --> 01:23:23,369
And the artwork is titled 'Scar Tissue'.

795
01:23:23,697 --> 01:23:26,678
I'll open the bidding at 17 lakhs.

796
01:23:26,766 --> 01:23:28,871
Seventeen lakhs, ladies and gentlemen.

797
01:23:28,969 --> 01:23:32,644
Do I have any bids at 17 lakhs?

798
01:23:32,739 --> 01:23:35,913
Seventeen lakhs...
Fair warning... 17...

799
01:23:36,009 --> 01:23:38,956
Eighteen lakhs... we have
18 lakhs on my left.

800
01:23:39,045 --> 01:23:41,821
We are at 18 lakhs,
ladies and gentlemen...

801
01:23:41,915 --> 01:23:44,395
Anymore at 18 lakhs?

802
01:23:44,484 --> 01:23:46,760
Fair warning... I will sell.

803
01:23:46,853 --> 01:23:48,491
And... sold!

804
01:23:49,089 --> 01:23:52,536
To the gentleman on my left
at 18 lakhs.

805
01:23:55,929 --> 01:23:59,172
That brings us to the end of our auction,
ladies and gentlemen.

806
01:23:59,466 --> 01:24:02,106
Thank you all so much
for your generosity.

807
01:24:02,402 --> 01:24:06,077
And now I would like to introduce
our next act for the evening

808
01:24:06,172 --> 01:24:11,121
we have a performance
by a duet from India and Pakistan

809
01:24:59,626 --> 01:25:00,696
Will you just excuse me for a minute?

810
01:25:00,794 --> 01:25:02,398
- A warm welcome to you all

811
01:25:02,495 --> 01:25:06,170
- to the lndo-Pak Summit - Roots.

812
01:25:06,466 --> 01:25:09,470
- And now I present to you
the evening's special performance

813
01:25:09,569 --> 01:25:12,846
- dedicated to the people
of both our countries.

814
01:25:50,677 --> 01:25:54,625
Let there be an expression of love

815
01:25:54,714 --> 01:25:57,991
There's love buried
deep within the heart

816
01:25:58,084 --> 01:25:59,995
The heart beats alone

817
01:26:00,086 --> 01:26:01,963
Alone

818
01:26:02,055 --> 01:26:04,626
Heart to heart

819
01:26:04,724 --> 01:26:08,672
Let there be an expression of love

820
01:26:12,599 --> 01:26:16,638
Let there be an expression of love

821
01:26:16,736 --> 01:26:18,613
Buried deep within the heart

822
01:26:18,705 --> 01:26:21,948
The heart beats alone

823
01:26:22,041 --> 01:26:23,679
Alone

824
01:26:39,726 --> 01:26:43,606
What's happened, Firdaus?
Don't you have anything to say to me?

825
01:26:44,631 --> 01:26:46,542
I've said what I had to, Noor.

826
01:26:52,806 --> 01:26:54,080
I love you.

827
01:26:56,075 --> 01:26:58,419
Don't be childish, Noor.

828
01:26:59,045 --> 01:27:00,718
You hardly know me.

829
01:27:07,787 --> 01:27:11,929
We were destined for just this much.

830
01:27:13,860 --> 01:27:16,340
Please let's just be grateful
for what we had.

831
01:27:17,564 --> 01:27:19,908
Is this like some dole you handed out?

832
01:27:22,101 --> 01:27:26,607
I love you, don't you get it?

833
01:27:26,706 --> 01:27:28,686
But I don't, Noor.

834
01:27:29,809 --> 01:27:31,846
I can't love like this.

835
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:35,484
What do you want?

836
01:27:36,349 --> 01:27:37,828
That I leave all this?

837
01:27:37,917 --> 01:27:40,420
Come with you on your houseboat?

838
01:27:41,654 --> 01:27:44,635
What will happen then?
Have you thought about it?

839
01:27:45,091 --> 01:27:47,469
Have you thought
about anything at all?

840
01:27:48,928 --> 01:27:50,805
You are too much, Noor.

841
01:28:04,110 --> 01:28:06,386
I'm getting engaged in two days.

842
01:28:07,580 --> 01:28:09,526
Bilal will keep me happy.

843
01:28:10,016 --> 01:28:13,896
We've been friends for years.
We understand each other.

844
01:28:14,988 --> 01:28:18,094
And I can't let a
stupid mistake ruin this.

845
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:24,601
What about love, Firdaus?

846
01:28:26,499 --> 01:28:27,978
Or is money everything?

847
01:28:29,435 --> 01:28:31,972
You know no one
can love you like I can.

848
01:28:32,071 --> 01:28:33,812
I don't want so much madness, Noor.

849
01:28:34,674 --> 01:28:36,415
And it's not about money.

850
01:28:36,509 --> 01:28:38,785
Marriage is between equals.

851
01:28:39,612 --> 01:28:43,924
Families are involved.
You won't understand.

852
01:28:44,984 --> 01:28:48,090
You won't understand anything
besides your love.

853
01:28:48,388 --> 01:28:51,369
Why are you lying
to yourself, Firdaus?

854
01:28:53,693 --> 01:28:57,505
I have to go now.
I can't be missing for so long.

855
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:01,743
Please, Firdaus.

856
01:29:03,803 --> 01:29:11,085
Why are we standing so far away
From each other?

857
01:29:11,811 --> 01:29:13,722
In your breath

858
01:29:13,813 --> 01:29:15,724
And in mine

859
01:29:15,815 --> 01:29:18,819
We breath the same air

860
01:29:19,118 --> 01:29:21,689
I Will die

861
01:29:21,788 --> 01:29:25,497
Don't leave me so

862
01:29:27,827 --> 01:29:31,741
Let there be an expression of love

863
01:29:31,831 --> 01:29:33,777
There's love buried
deep within the heart

864
01:29:33,866 --> 01:29:37,109
The heart beats alone

865
01:29:37,403 --> 01:29:39,007
Alone

866
01:29:39,138 --> 01:29:40,583
Arif. - Yes?

867
01:29:40,673 --> 01:29:41,743
Heart to heart

868
01:29:41,841 --> 01:29:44,014
Let there be an expression of love

869
01:29:44,110 --> 01:29:45,111
Noor...

870
01:29:46,079 --> 01:29:47,888
That's enough.
Let's get out of here.

871
01:29:48,514 --> 01:29:49,959
No. Not yet.

872
01:29:51,017 --> 01:29:52,894
In a bit.

873
01:29:53,186 --> 01:29:56,656
Noor, we've spent too much time here.

874
01:29:56,756 --> 01:29:58,758
Let's go somewhere else.

875
01:30:04,931 --> 01:30:06,001
Hang on.

876
01:30:07,433 --> 01:30:08,639
I'll just go meet Firdaus and come.

877
01:30:08,735 --> 01:30:09,645
Noor...

878
01:30:10,436 --> 01:30:11,414
Let her go.

879
01:30:13,906 --> 01:30:16,079
Which part of this
don't you understand?

880
01:30:17,410 --> 01:30:19,151
It's not that she lied to you.

881
01:30:20,847 --> 01:30:23,487
I know... I know...
but these people are like this.

882
01:30:23,583 --> 01:30:26,154
She is the Begum's daughter after all.

883
01:30:26,452 --> 01:30:28,591
They don't care for anyone.

884
01:30:28,688 --> 01:30:31,669
They will swallow you whole
and you won't even know it.

885
01:30:31,758 --> 01:30:32,759
Get out of all this.

886
01:30:32,859 --> 01:30:34,133
Don't screw up your career.

887
01:30:40,700 --> 01:30:44,512
You've been a good friend.
I'll never forget that.

888
01:30:44,604 --> 01:30:48,108
Now go home.
Don't give me your advice.

889
01:30:48,608 --> 01:30:50,679
You can go shove it.

890
01:30:51,811 --> 01:30:54,189
To hell with you,
your Leena and my future.

891
01:30:59,552 --> 01:31:01,623
Bro, give me a drink.

892
01:31:20,540 --> 01:31:25,455
Noor, my dear, what a talented artist
you are turning out to be!

893
01:31:30,616 --> 01:31:32,118
Noor, what the hell is wrong with you!

894
01:31:32,418 --> 01:31:34,159
You are completely out of your...

895
01:31:36,522 --> 01:31:37,592
Firdaus!

896
01:31:49,602 --> 01:31:50,706
Excuse me...

897
01:31:51,971 --> 01:31:52,972
No, sir... don't.

898
01:32:01,414 --> 01:32:02,484
Please, sir, stand back.

899
01:32:05,785 --> 01:32:07,787
If you ask for milk,
we will give you pudding!

900
01:32:07,887 --> 01:32:10,458
But if you ask for Kashmir,
we will give you a thrashing!

901
01:32:11,023 --> 01:32:12,661
If you ask for milk,
we will give you pudding!

902
01:32:12,759 --> 01:32:14,898
But if you ask for Kashmir,
we will give you a thrashing!

903
01:32:26,506 --> 01:32:29,749
Such a bright chap... gone!

904
01:32:32,411 --> 01:32:33,719
You can't get drunk
and create a ruckus

905
01:32:33,813 --> 01:32:35,451
at this kind of a
high profile event!

906
01:32:37,517 --> 01:32:38,518
Take him away!

907
01:32:44,490 --> 01:32:46,800
Lock him up for the night.

908
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:49,663
A thrashing will bring him
to his senses.

909
01:32:55,168 --> 01:32:57,478
You should have kept him in check.

910
01:32:58,704 --> 01:33:01,878
Was it necessary to
bring it down to this?

911
01:33:05,144 --> 01:33:07,818
Whatever happened in the past,

912
01:33:07,914 --> 01:33:10,690
I have no interest in digging into it.

913
01:33:14,987 --> 01:33:18,799
But your future is
mine and mine alone.

914
01:33:23,496 --> 01:33:24,634
Isn't it?

915
01:33:27,834 --> 01:33:29,142
Isn't it?

916
01:33:37,410 --> 01:33:38,684
Nizami!

917
01:33:39,679 --> 01:33:41,158
You got bail.

918
01:33:41,447 --> 01:33:44,621
Take him with you too.

919
01:33:44,717 --> 01:33:46,890
He's been sitting here
for two whole days.

920
01:33:46,986 --> 01:33:48,932
Mad family!

921
01:34:06,138 --> 01:34:07,981
Let's go home, Jun-jiju.

922
01:34:10,676 --> 01:34:12,622
I did what I had to.

923
01:34:13,379 --> 01:34:15,086
Here, drink this.

924
01:34:16,549 --> 01:34:17,823
Cool down.

925
01:34:19,652 --> 01:34:22,098
I've ruined everything.

926
01:34:23,756 --> 01:34:24,928
I had lost my mind.

927
01:34:30,997 --> 01:34:33,671
I only thought about myself

928
01:34:34,734 --> 01:34:36,839
and this great love of mine!

929
01:34:43,709 --> 01:34:45,518
Forgive me, Jun-jiju!

930
01:34:48,381 --> 01:34:49,553
Don't cry.

931
01:34:49,682 --> 01:34:51,491
Everything will work out.

932
01:35:02,061 --> 01:35:04,063
This was my mother's
prized possession.

933
01:35:05,965 --> 01:35:08,912
I've cared for it like a baby.

934
01:35:23,616 --> 01:35:26,722
You need to forget about
what happened in Delhi, Firdaus.

935
01:35:27,653 --> 01:35:29,633
That story is now over.

936
01:35:30,957 --> 01:35:33,733
Now you are going to become
someone else's possession.

937
01:35:37,096 --> 01:35:39,633
What will I do being
someone else's possession?

938
01:35:41,834 --> 01:35:44,371
Hang around their neck my entire life?

939
01:35:46,539 --> 01:35:47,916
Don't be crazy, Firdaus.

940
01:35:48,741 --> 01:35:50,982
You don't know what you are saying.

941
01:35:51,978 --> 01:35:56,393
I know, I should do what is right.

942
01:35:58,884 --> 01:36:01,922
I know... I know it all.

943
01:36:02,822 --> 01:36:05,132
I have been hearing all of this
since I was a child.

944
01:36:08,627 --> 01:36:10,629
But my heart feels otherwise.

945
01:36:13,799 --> 01:36:15,801
Something is not right.

946
01:36:19,805 --> 01:36:23,810
Tell me mother...
what should I do?

947
01:36:24,744 --> 01:36:26,553
Don't worry my doll.

948
01:36:26,779 --> 01:36:28,622
I was your age once.

949
01:36:30,516 --> 01:36:33,463
I had also got swept up
in all these emotions.

950
01:36:34,420 --> 01:36:35,899
What did I get in return?

951
01:36:38,657 --> 01:36:41,467
Do you want to live my life, Firdaus?

952
01:36:43,095 --> 01:36:46,133
It's not necessary that
what happened with you

953
01:36:46,432 --> 01:36:47,843
will happen to me.

954
01:36:49,101 --> 01:36:50,739
Yes, of course...

955
01:36:52,004 --> 01:36:53,847
It's not necessary at all.

956
01:36:54,774 --> 01:36:57,755
Anyway what wrong
has ever happened with you?

957
01:36:57,843 --> 01:36:59,982
You are a fortunate one.

958
01:37:00,513 --> 01:37:03,824
L-low else would an orphan ever
become the pride of this palace'?

959
01:37:07,620 --> 01:37:08,860
Is it necessary to remind me
again and again, mother?

960
01:37:08,954 --> 01:37:10,729
Yes, it is, Firdaus.

961
01:37:13,059 --> 01:37:17,633
I had thought that God had sent
you to me for a special purpose.

962
01:37:18,597 --> 01:37:20,941
I protected you from everyone.

963
01:37:22,668 --> 01:37:24,511
You were special.

964
01:37:32,778 --> 01:37:35,622
You are still special, my doll.

965
01:37:36,382 --> 01:37:39,488
You've not been made to
waste away in love.

966
01:37:40,052 --> 01:37:46,765
This palace now needs a man,
a name, a title.

967
01:37:51,564 --> 01:37:54,875
And now you are going to bring
back that lost splendor.

968
01:37:56,702 --> 01:37:59,774
We can't be out on the streets again.

969
01:38:00,473 --> 01:38:03,113
Neither you, nor I.

970
01:38:06,112 --> 01:38:07,955
Please get dressed soon.

971
01:38:10,049 --> 01:38:12,086
Bilal will be here any moment.

972
01:38:30,035 --> 01:38:33,380
Congratulations!

973
01:38:33,472 --> 01:38:35,611
Be blessed!

974
01:38:47,119 --> 01:38:51,465
Praise the Lord,
stay happy you both.

975
01:38:55,594 --> 01:38:58,473
Aunt Nargis, drop the spoons
and dig into it with your hands!

976
01:38:58,564 --> 01:38:59,804
You won't become fat.

977
01:38:59,899 --> 01:39:00,809
Rascal!

978
01:39:02,568 --> 01:39:05,515
Kaleem, please feed
him some meatballs.

979
01:39:13,512 --> 01:39:15,890
So many years have gone by

980
01:39:15,981 --> 01:39:18,120
you still haven't been
able to forget her.

981
01:39:19,785 --> 01:39:24,700
Dear, the heart moves
in mysterious ways.

982
01:39:26,158 --> 01:39:29,901
He who hasn't felt that yearning,
has not lived at all.

983
01:39:32,131 --> 01:39:35,010
It's truly a blessing to be in love!

984
01:39:35,100 --> 01:39:40,049
As time passes,
it only gets stronger.

985
01:40:05,564 --> 01:40:09,068
Pure, beautiful, soulful.

986
01:40:13,439 --> 01:40:14,679
I may be cursed like that.

987
01:40:14,773 --> 01:40:18,516
That the heart yearns for
what once was.

988
01:40:18,611 --> 01:40:20,852
Those sweet fragrant days of my past.

989
01:41:24,810 --> 01:41:27,450
London's my last chance.

990
01:41:31,450 --> 01:41:33,521
Will you come along?

991
01:41:33,619 --> 01:41:36,122
I don't have the strength
to do this alone.

992
01:41:38,524 --> 01:41:39,594
Arif?

993
01:41:45,464 --> 01:41:47,637
Should I do push ups for you?

994
01:41:50,536 --> 01:41:52,607
Give me 5O right now.

995
01:42:15,627 --> 01:42:19,370
Let me show you the gallery
and the space for your exhibition.

996
01:42:28,674 --> 01:42:31,018
And here is the outdoor space
for your exhibition.

997
01:42:31,110 --> 01:42:33,852
I hope it's inspiring enough!

998
01:42:44,923 --> 01:42:47,403
So 3O meters... we can't go wrong
With that. Alright?

999
01:42:47,493 --> 01:42:49,666
Just measure it
and come back and tell me.

1000
01:42:49,762 --> 01:42:50,866
Sure.

1001
01:42:51,597 --> 01:42:54,635
Congratulations...
we made it to the London Time Out.

1002
01:43:40,779 --> 01:43:43,385
This is centre stage!
London, isn't it?

1003
01:43:43,782 --> 01:43:46,922
There is something very interesting
about the way he thinks.

1004
01:43:47,019 --> 01:43:48,521
The way he articulates his expression.

1005
01:44:02,601 --> 01:44:05,172
What could be macabre for one

1006
01:44:05,471 --> 01:44:07,747
could be freedom for someone else.

1007
01:44:21,987 --> 01:44:26,129
Noor, my child...
you disappeared again!

1008
01:44:26,425 --> 01:44:29,736
Now I have to meet you in
this foreign city.

1009
01:44:29,828 --> 01:44:32,775
When Jagirdar told me,
I couldn't keep myself from coming.

1010
01:44:34,099 --> 01:44:36,807
Firdaus sent these flowers
for your big day.

1011
01:44:39,505 --> 01:44:41,041
Oh my God!

1012
01:44:51,850 --> 01:44:54,490
You were always a good artisan

1013
01:44:55,153 --> 01:44:58,100
but now you have truly
bloomed into an artist!

1014
01:44:59,825 --> 01:45:02,431
There is depth in your work now.

1015
01:45:04,596 --> 01:45:06,132
Good show, Noor!

1016
01:45:08,667 --> 01:45:10,806
Somebody smashed your heart big time!

1017
01:45:11,970 --> 01:45:16,646
You have poured out everything,
you must be all empty now.

1018
01:45:18,677 --> 01:45:20,816
You must be feeling naked.

1019
01:45:21,613 --> 01:45:23,957
Noor. .. over here!

1020
01:46:05,824 --> 01:46:07,599
Begum!

1021
01:46:09,161 --> 01:46:11,698
Begum...
Firdaus didn't come?

1022
01:46:12,698 --> 01:46:15,406
Firdaus! Firdaus!

1023
01:46:17,369 --> 01:46:19,610
I came...
doesn't that mean anything?

1024
01:46:19,938 --> 01:46:21,611
Go inside, Noor.

1025
01:46:22,007 --> 01:46:24,510
This is the biggest day of your life.

1026
01:46:26,445 --> 01:46:27,981
Forget everything else.

1027
01:46:31,850 --> 01:46:33,124
Begum!

1028
01:46:48,734 --> 01:46:52,409
Noor Nizami. .. Artist.

1029
01:46:54,606 --> 01:46:57,678
Don't worry.
Jagirdar has sent me.

1030
01:46:58,510 --> 01:46:59,989
Come, I'll drop you home.

1031
01:47:00,078 --> 01:47:02,581
No. I want to be alone.

1032
01:47:02,681 --> 01:47:04,160
We are all alone.

1033
01:47:04,783 --> 01:47:07,161
Come. Have a drink with me.

1034
01:47:09,921 --> 01:47:12,060
Come on, sir.

1035
01:47:12,357 --> 01:47:15,361
Will treat you to
London's best Kashmiri tea.

1036
01:47:15,460 --> 01:47:16,438
Come.

1037
01:47:34,046 --> 01:47:35,491
Noor Nizami.

1038
01:47:36,415 --> 01:47:39,988
That runt of a boy who used to
ride a boat on the Dal Lake.

1039
01:47:40,752 --> 01:47:42,129
Look at him today.

1040
01:47:43,388 --> 01:47:45,390
The rising star of the art world!

1041
01:47:46,992 --> 01:47:48,733
Have we met before?

1042
01:47:54,700 --> 01:47:56,043
I swear to God.

1043
01:47:58,437 --> 01:48:00,542
I will tear you apart.

1044
01:48:02,941 --> 01:48:04,045
Ivluazzam!

1045
01:48:06,678 --> 01:48:09,716
Nowadays, I am known by the
name of Mirza Baig.

1046
01:48:10,048 --> 01:48:11,550
What do you want from me?

1047
01:48:12,417 --> 01:48:13,828
Jagirdar? - Yes.

1048
01:48:14,820 --> 01:48:17,027
I had sent Jagirdar to you.

1049
01:48:20,025 --> 01:48:23,336
Your arts scholarship is
standing in front of you.

1050
01:48:23,428 --> 01:48:27,342
IIC Delhi...
The Gallery of Modern Art

1051
01:48:30,335 --> 01:48:32,337
The exhibition at the Aman

1052
01:48:37,976 --> 01:48:39,046
The Freedom Series

1053
01:48:45,550 --> 01:48:47,723
All your show-stoppers!

1054
01:48:47,819 --> 01:48:49,924
I picked up all of them.

1055
01:48:52,824 --> 01:48:54,770
I doubled your price overnight.

1056
01:48:57,963 --> 01:48:58,998
Lies!

1057
01:49:01,366 --> 01:49:03,471
After what happened in Delhi,

1058
01:49:03,535 --> 01:49:06,709
I had great difficulty convincing
the London organizers.

1059
01:49:12,377 --> 01:49:13,151
Why?

1060
01:49:14,613 --> 01:49:16,490
I had two sons your age.

1061
01:49:18,550 --> 01:49:20,530
My jihad ate them up.

1062
01:49:21,887 --> 01:49:25,164
Neither did I get freedom, nor death.

1063
01:49:26,124 --> 01:49:28,866
I came here under a different name.

1064
01:49:29,795 --> 01:49:31,502
Worked night and day.

1065
01:49:31,596 --> 01:49:33,166
And built all this from scratch.

1066
01:49:33,765 --> 01:49:35,540
But away from my country

1067
01:49:35,967 --> 01:49:38,038
I couldn't forget that boy

1068
01:49:38,103 --> 01:49:40,140
who risked it all
to bring me a warm coat.

1069
01:49:41,473 --> 01:49:45,114
The thought of that coat
kept me warm many a night.

1070
01:49:48,146 --> 01:49:51,093
Today when everyone in the gallery
were singing your praises

1071
01:49:51,183 --> 01:49:53,993
I had tears in my eyes!

1072
01:49:55,020 --> 01:49:59,025
Noor, my boy. We did it!

1073
01:50:02,594 --> 01:50:06,770
We? This is all about you.

1074
01:50:09,701 --> 01:50:11,703
Did anyone ever ask me what I wanted?

1075
01:50:12,003 --> 01:50:13,812
Don't be upset, Noor!

1076
01:50:14,573 --> 01:50:16,519
At least not today.

1077
01:50:19,644 --> 01:50:20,884
Today?

1078
01:50:21,479 --> 01:50:25,017
Today you've reduced me to nothing!

1079
01:50:25,851 --> 01:50:28,161
Today, I don't even know who I am.

1080
01:50:28,854 --> 01:50:31,733
Am I even worth anything?

1081
01:50:32,424 --> 01:50:33,994
Why did you do all this?

1082
01:50:35,627 --> 01:50:37,538
Who told you to do all this?

1083
01:50:37,629 --> 01:50:39,905
You can't just play God as you please.

1084
01:50:41,900 --> 01:50:44,642
Screw your charity!

1085
01:50:44,736 --> 01:50:47,615
I don't want it... don't want it!

1086
01:51:02,120 --> 01:51:05,533
No matter how hard you run
your past does not forget you.

1087
01:51:08,827 --> 01:51:10,465
It follows you like your shadow.

1088
01:51:10,562 --> 01:51:13,099
You are now going to be
part of this legacy.

1089
01:51:13,398 --> 01:51:16,572
Your new life starts from today.
God bless you!

1090
01:51:16,768 --> 01:51:19,510
For better or for worse

1091
01:51:19,571 --> 01:51:21,448
I will always be that boy from the Dal.

1092
01:51:21,506 --> 01:51:22,780
Little Noora!

1093
01:51:22,874 --> 01:51:24,911
To be deserving of Firdaus

1094
01:51:25,010 --> 01:51:26,785
you have to become someone.

1095
01:51:26,912 --> 01:51:29,916
Presenting... man of the hour
Noor Nizami!

1096
01:51:30,849 --> 01:51:35,628
My whole life was a lie... a conspiracy.

1097
01:52:01,046 --> 01:52:03,492
Why did you lie to me?

1098
01:52:09,020 --> 01:52:10,761
Why did you say that if
I want to win over Firdaus

1099
01:52:10,855 --> 01:52:12,664
I need to become someone?

1100
01:52:16,728 --> 01:52:18,833
Why did you make me feel

1101
01:52:18,930 --> 01:52:21,035
that you are making me
worthy of her?

1102
01:52:21,132 --> 01:52:23,840
You thought whatever you had to.

1103
01:52:23,935 --> 01:52:26,677
I never promised you anything.

1104
01:52:28,073 --> 01:52:31,885
Your thoughts always got ahead of you.

1105
01:52:37,015 --> 01:52:38,392
My thoughts?

1106
01:52:39,551 --> 01:52:41,531
And what you did was nothing?

1107
01:52:42,821 --> 01:52:44,698
All this was a game for you.

1108
01:52:46,491 --> 01:52:49,131
You laid my heart out
and played dice on it.

1109
01:52:52,130 --> 01:52:53,700
And Firdaus?

1110
01:52:54,432 --> 01:52:56,412
You should have at least
thought about her?

1111
01:52:57,168 --> 01:52:58,806
Don't you dare take her name.

1112
01:53:03,475 --> 01:53:05,682
When I saw you for the first time

1113
01:53:05,944 --> 01:53:07,719
I knew right away.

1114
01:53:09,447 --> 01:53:11,051
That same attitude

1115
01:53:11,349 --> 01:53:13,590
that same insolent stare.

1116
01:53:15,587 --> 01:53:18,693
I knew that you would strike
when the opportunity arose.

1117
01:53:24,062 --> 01:53:26,099
But not this time...

1118
01:53:28,833 --> 01:53:30,574
not this time, Mufti.

1119
01:53:31,770 --> 01:53:35,377
I have kept Firdaus' heart
locked up in my coffer.

1120
01:53:36,074 --> 01:53:38,145
It's invaluable.

1121
01:53:40,045 --> 01:53:43,424
People of your ilk
can't even glance at her.

1122
01:53:44,716 --> 01:53:47,959
She is getting married to Bilal.

1123
01:53:58,396 --> 01:54:01,468
Can you feel it? It's broken.
- Yes!

1124
01:54:05,036 --> 01:54:08,108
And now you take these broken pieces

1125
01:54:08,807 --> 01:54:10,718
and mend it all your life.

1126
01:54:14,913 --> 01:54:17,086
Why did you betray me?

1127
01:54:19,350 --> 01:54:21,557
Where did my love fall short?

1128
01:54:24,923 --> 01:54:27,961
Now you will know, Mufti

1129
01:54:28,059 --> 01:54:30,733
how it feels when the heart breaks.

1130
01:54:33,064 --> 01:54:36,705
L-low a living throbbing life
comes to a complete stand still.

1131
01:54:37,569 --> 01:54:38,843
Now you will know!

1132
01:54:41,473 --> 01:54:45,979
No, father! No!

1133
01:54:46,077 --> 01:54:48,387
No, father... my child!

1134
01:54:48,913 --> 01:54:53,828
My Child Will die!

1135
01:54:55,687 --> 01:54:58,759
No, father!

1136
01:55:04,462 --> 01:55:07,068
My child will die.

1137
01:55:47,805 --> 01:55:49,910
Come!

1138
01:55:50,842 --> 01:55:54,016
Let her go. Forgive her!

1139
01:55:54,112 --> 01:55:56,422
Move aside.

1140
01:55:56,814 --> 01:55:59,727
Please don't do this.

1141
01:55:59,951 --> 01:56:01,988
She made a mistake. Let her go.

1142
01:56:02,520 --> 01:56:04,727
She's your daughter!

1143
01:56:04,822 --> 01:56:07,632
We raised a whore for our daughter!

1144
01:56:07,725 --> 01:56:10,763
She has stripped me
in front of the whole world.

1145
01:56:11,029 --> 01:56:12,440
Drop that phone!

1146
01:56:13,364 --> 01:56:15,071
No doctor will come to this house.

1147
01:56:15,700 --> 01:56:18,704
Let her rot along
with her goddamn child!

1148
01:56:19,737 --> 01:56:20,977
Mother...

1149
01:57:24,435 --> 01:57:26,108
Your child is a girl.

1150
01:57:55,500 --> 01:57:56,877
Madam.

1151
01:58:10,381 --> 01:58:11,416
Firdaus.

1152
01:58:21,693 --> 01:58:22,728
Noor...

1153
01:58:35,106 --> 01:58:36,107
Noor!

1154
01:58:40,478 --> 01:58:41,855
Firdaus.

1155
01:59:21,386 --> 01:59:23,832
If I'm destined to ruin

1156
01:59:25,022 --> 01:59:26,000
I accept.

1157
01:59:26,991 --> 01:59:29,562
If this is how it has to end

1158
01:59:31,028 --> 01:59:32,132
then I accept.

1159
01:59:33,398 --> 01:59:36,038
I accept! I accept! I accept!

1160
02:00:17,375 --> 02:00:25,817
Prayer for the departed.

1161
02:00:34,992 --> 02:00:35,902
Child.

1162
02:01:43,794 --> 02:01:45,899
It was an accident, dear.

1163
02:01:48,466 --> 02:01:50,605
Don't curse yourself so much.

1164
02:01:53,704 --> 02:01:56,583
It will take time but we will
try to get through this.

1165
02:02:00,711 --> 02:02:04,989
Let's complete the rituals
and head to Islamabad.

1166
02:02:07,785 --> 02:02:10,459
Noor had come to meet mother.

1167
02:02:12,456 --> 02:02:14,367
I need to see him.

1168
02:02:14,458 --> 02:02:15,562
What?

1169
02:02:15,660 --> 02:02:17,105
Noor...

1170
02:02:17,395 --> 02:02:18,533
I want to meet him.

1171
02:02:19,730 --> 02:02:21,641
Your mother just passed away.

1172
02:02:21,732 --> 02:02:24,042
People are saying all sorts of things.

1173
02:02:24,135 --> 02:02:26,513
And you still haven't
come to your senses, Firdaus?

1174
02:02:26,571 --> 02:02:27,948
Didn't I warn you?

1175
02:02:28,039 --> 02:02:30,041
No more beyond this... that's it!

1176
02:02:30,141 --> 02:02:31,620
Didn't I?

1177
02:02:34,545 --> 02:02:37,492
Don't make the same mistake
that your mother made.

1178
02:02:42,420 --> 02:02:47,130
I am not my father who'll bow down
all my life and pine away.

1179
02:02:59,904 --> 02:03:03,852
It doesn't let go even when you die.

1180
02:03:05,409 --> 02:03:06,854
Love...

1181
02:03:07,912 --> 02:03:10,188
Love is a strange beast.

1182
02:03:10,481 --> 02:03:15,055
You can whip it, starve it,
push it deep down in your insides.

1183
02:03:15,353 --> 02:03:17,629
But you can't pull it out of you.

1184
02:03:21,592 --> 02:03:24,072
If your heart knows where it belongs

1185
02:03:24,662 --> 02:03:26,972
you'll fight with the
whole world to get there.

1186
02:03:36,974 --> 02:03:39,079
A wise man once said

1187
02:03:39,377 --> 02:03:41,857
it's truly a blessing to be in love.

1188
02:03:41,912 --> 02:03:44,449
Let it possess you.

1189
02:03:44,548 --> 02:03:47,028
Without fear, without shame.

1190
02:03:47,118 --> 02:03:48,927
Without thought.

1191
02:03:49,120 --> 02:03:51,430
Love in itself is its own reward.

1192
02:03:51,822 --> 02:03:53,392
No one wins, no one loses.

1193
02:04:42,073 --> 02:04:43,609
Noor!

1194
02:04:46,110 --> 02:04:47,111
Noor!

1195
02:06:02,853 --> 02:06:05,026
Will you stop staring, Noor?
