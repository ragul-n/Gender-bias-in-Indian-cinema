1
00:01:44,151 --> 00:01:45,812
Murli Manohar is screwed.

2
00:01:47,154 --> 00:01:49,145
""- lsn"t it, jailer?
- Right.""

3
00:01:50,424 --> 00:01:53,552
Balraj Rana"s pimp has
become the chief Minister.

4
00:01:54,161 --> 00:01:59,895
""Mr. kalal, this is politics.
One can never be sure of anything.""

5
00:02:01,435 --> 00:02:05,098
l"d mentioned my son to you

6
00:02:05,772 --> 00:02:08,104
l want him admitted
to a Medical college.

7
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:11,768
You need Rs.10 lakhs
to pay the donation?

8
00:02:13,113 --> 00:02:18,107
Don"t worry. You"ll get it.
Your son will become a doctor.

9
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,612
For me you turned this cell
into a five star hotel room.

10
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:26,717
can"t l do this much for you?

11
00:02:27,127 --> 00:02:28,719
""Thank you, Sir.""

12
00:02:34,134 --> 00:02:36,125
l"ll take your leave.

13
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:45,135
""- Good day Sir. - Murli Manohar,
you thought you were invincible.""

14
00:02:46,746 --> 00:02:48,543
Madhukar kulkarni turned
out to be much smarter.

15
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:54,143
A leader like you who is
defeated is like an old whore.

16
00:02:56,156 --> 00:03:00,149
l think it"s time you
retired from politics.

17
00:03:01,094 --> 00:03:05,827
You are wrong. A whore may grow old..

18
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,497
But a leader never grows old.

19
00:03:10,103 --> 00:03:13,095
Madhukar kulkarni has
become the chief Minister.

20
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,503
What remains to be seen is
how long his government lasts!

21
00:03:18,111 --> 00:03:21,103
kulkarni being the chief
minister is a challenge for us!

22
00:03:22,115 --> 00:03:25,710
You are aware he is
Balraj Rana"s man

23
00:03:26,119 --> 00:03:28,280
He won the elections only
because of his support.

24
00:03:30,123 --> 00:03:32,114
Madhukar kulkarni has
formed the government but..

25
00:03:33,126 --> 00:03:35,617
..the remote control is
in Balraj Rana"s hand.

26
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:41,123
He will make Madhukar
dance to his tune.

27
00:03:41,468 --> 00:03:47,134
""lf that be true, l won"t let
Madhukar"s government last long.""

28
00:03:48,141 --> 00:03:51,542
That"s what l want! l"m willing
to spend any amount of money.

29
00:03:53,146 --> 00:03:55,546
You think of what is to be done.

30
00:03:58,151 --> 00:03:59,812
l"ve thought it over.

31
00:04:01,087 --> 00:04:04,750
Take this and understand the job

32
00:04:06,092 --> 00:04:09,084
create riots and strife in the city

33
00:04:09,763 --> 00:04:13,096
""Gang war, bomb blast, looting!""

34
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:23,839
lnvoke such panic that none can
save the government from toppling.

35
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:27,111
- l got that.
- But mind you...

36
00:04:28,448 --> 00:04:34,512
Nobody should find out that
kalal company incited it.

37
00:04:35,121 --> 00:04:38,784
Gulu Pathan forgets the name
of the company after being paid

38
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:42,288
Don"t worry. Your name
will not be exposed.

39
00:04:43,129 --> 00:04:44,528
God speed.

40
00:05:26,106 --> 00:05:27,505
Beat him up!

41
00:05:43,123 --> 00:05:45,387
- Who is it?
- Pratap Dalal here.

42
00:05:46,126 --> 00:05:49,857
- Yes boss?
- Your life is in danger.

43
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,792
The police is trying to sniff you out

44
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:56,125
Balraj Rana"s men too
are fielding for you.

45
00:05:57,137 --> 00:06:00,129
They"ll terminate you if spotted.

46
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,332
- What do l do?
- Leave Mumbai as soon as possible.

47
00:06:04,077 --> 00:06:06,068
Take the road via Gorakhpur to Nepal

48
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,742
l"ll arrange for you to
leave for Hong kong.

49
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,074
- Get it?
- Yes boss.

50
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,489
Holy cow!

51
00:06:31,104 --> 00:06:35,598
No Vithal Sir! Forgive me
l made a terrible mistake!

52
00:06:36,109 --> 00:06:39,101
Please forgive me!
l am so sorry! No!!

53
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:49,111
Don"t kill me! Forgive me!

54
00:06:49,522 --> 00:06:51,615
No! Please! l"m sorry!

55
00:06:52,525 --> 00:06:58,794
How much did Shankar Dalal
pay you to instigate riots?

56
00:07:20,086 --> 00:07:23,078
Nazir kaskar! Don"t act smart!

57
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:27,082
Don"t you know my name?
Anya kholi. Got it?

58
00:07:28,094 --> 00:07:30,426
Don"t teach a fish to swim.

59
00:07:32,098 --> 00:07:35,090
l know you were an
ordinary building contractor.

60
00:07:36,102 --> 00:07:39,367
Mr. Balraj helped you
to become a big builder.

61
00:07:40,507 --> 00:07:42,702
""For Pete"s sake, don"t act smart!""

62
00:07:43,109 --> 00:07:46,772
Get to the point. What???
You want 500 cases!

63
00:07:47,113 --> 00:07:51,106
Do you think this is the World
Bank? Or do we have a money plant?

64
00:07:52,118 --> 00:07:55,519
Tell him a 100 cases
is enough to begin work.

65
00:07:56,122 --> 00:07:59,717
""- Why does he want 500 cases?
- Right, Vithal. Hey, Nazir..""

66
00:07:59,859 --> 00:08:03,454
Don"t irritate. l"ll tell the
boss and arrange 100 cases for you.

67
00:08:03,797 --> 00:08:06,061
Begin work. We"ll see to the rest.

68
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:09,065
Why do you worry?
Your colony will be built.

69
00:08:09,402 --> 00:08:10,733
The government is ours.
Everything is in our hands.

70
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:22,070
What"s the matter AcP?
We"re decent people.

71
00:08:22,482 --> 00:08:25,076
We have no illegal business.
We"re in the business of finance.

72
00:08:26,486 --> 00:08:28,078
Who you are..?
What business you conduct?

73
00:08:28,354 --> 00:08:30,413
With whom you have alliances..?
l know everything!

74
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:33,422
- Take them away!
- come on!

75
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,762
Where have you brought me?
Why don"t you tell me?

76
00:08:44,103 --> 00:08:46,094
- Who are you?
- Your Pops!

77
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:52,837
Why won"t you tell me..
where have you brought me?

78
00:08:54,113 --> 00:08:55,512
Why have l been kidnapped?

79
00:08:57,116 --> 00:09:01,644
l"m a judge! l"ll have
all of you convicted!

80
00:09:02,055 --> 00:09:04,046
You"ll get into trouble!

81
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:09,722
""Your Honour, l"ll tell you
why you have been brought here.""

82
00:09:11,064 --> 00:09:13,055
Take a look there..yes..

83
00:09:20,073 --> 00:09:22,064
""Your Honour, figure anything?""

84
00:09:32,085 --> 00:09:34,076
He got knocked out!

85
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:37,681
- Quickly get some water.
- Okay.

86
00:10:00,113 --> 00:10:05,107
l asked he be brought here alive
l don"t want his corpse!!

87
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:10,112
l brought him alive but
he fainted seeing your photo.

88
00:10:29,142 --> 00:10:30,700
""Balraj, Sir what is my fault?""

89
00:10:31,144 --> 00:10:33,135
Why have l been brought here?

90
00:10:34,147 --> 00:10:36,741
Vithal Rao and
Anna kholi are my men.

91
00:10:38,818 --> 00:10:42,811
They have no hand in the
murder of Gulu Pathan.

92
00:10:44,157 --> 00:10:49,823
- Yes... - Tomorrow the police
will present them in your court.

93
00:10:50,163 --> 00:10:54,156
l get it. They will be unharmed.

94
00:10:55,168 --> 00:10:59,332
l"ll announce the result
you desire in court.

95
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:07,705
- Yes boss?
- Let him go.

96
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:25,620
Get the gift.

97
00:11:31,137 --> 00:11:33,128
No Hindu wants to demolish a mosque

98
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,301
Nor does any Muslim
want to destroy a temple.

99
00:11:37,143 --> 00:11:40,738
This was a fight for the chair
in which thousands of innocents died.

100
00:11:41,147 --> 00:11:42,808
You are right.

101
00:11:43,549 --> 00:11:46,643
But now there"s peace thanks
to the grace of God. - Mother..

102
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:55,650
- Salutations.
- My son..

103
00:11:56,496 --> 00:11:59,158
""- How are you?
- l am well, son..""

104
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:02,100
- How are you?
- l"m fine.

105
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:07,103
l came to see you for
l was missing you.

106
00:12:08,107 --> 00:12:12,771
l"m glad. For some reason
l keep worrying about you.

107
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:20,785
You mustn"t worry. Your blessings
are always with me even if you"re not

108
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:27,524
Good day.

109
00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:33,531
""Mother, tell him l don"t
mind him coming here.""

110
00:12:35,301 --> 00:12:40,136
But the dark shadows of his
crimes can stain my uniform.

111
00:12:44,143 --> 00:12:47,135
""Mother, this world
is a cell of kohl.""

112
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,549
Nobody can escape
getting a few blemishes.

113
00:12:54,153 --> 00:13:01,082
Do tell Ajay his uniform will
never be stained because of me.

114
00:13:10,103 --> 00:13:13,095
Uncle! Hello.

115
00:13:14,107 --> 00:13:15,699
My sweet baby..come here.

116
00:13:18,111 --> 00:13:20,773
- How are you? - Fine.
- Where have you been?

117
00:13:21,114 --> 00:13:25,107
l was playing. Nobody
told me you had come.

118
00:13:26,119 --> 00:13:31,113
""Nobody tells my baby l"ve come.
See, what l got for you.""

119
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,525
Open it like this...

120
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:39,121
Switch it on from here..

121
00:13:43,136 --> 00:13:45,798
""- Grandma, isn"t it nice?
- Yes.""

122
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:50,906
This is how it is switched off.
Don"t see your uncle..where"s he?

123
00:13:51,144 --> 00:13:53,806
He"s gone to Mahabaleshwar
with some friends.

124
00:13:55,148 --> 00:13:58,606
So he"s gone on a picnic
with his friends..

125
00:14:05,691 --> 00:14:08,489
l want to give all of you a surprise.

126
00:14:17,103 --> 00:14:21,096
Every boy and girl has
something very cute and loving.

127
00:14:21,774 --> 00:14:25,107
Which becomes restless
when one steps into youth.

128
00:14:25,778 --> 00:14:28,110
lt gets very tough to control it.

129
00:14:29,382 --> 00:14:31,373
- know what it is?
- l don"t know.

130
00:14:32,118 --> 00:14:35,610
- Do you know? - No.
- What about you? - No idea.

131
00:14:37,123 --> 00:14:39,114
You tell us for we don"t know.

132
00:14:41,127 --> 00:14:42,526
The heart.

133
00:14:45,131 --> 00:14:48,123
But today l can"t control my heart.

134
00:14:49,135 --> 00:14:52,127
Therefore l want to give
my heart to somebody.

135
00:14:52,738 --> 00:14:54,865
l want to strike a deal.

136
00:14:55,141 --> 00:14:57,132
Does anyone want to buy my heart?

137
00:15:00,146 --> 00:15:03,081
l"ll tell you how the heart is bought.

138
00:15:23,502 --> 00:15:26,835
""Little lady, give me your heart""

139
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:34,273
""Little lady, give me your heart""

140
00:15:38,117 --> 00:15:42,110
convince your heart to negotiate

141
00:15:43,122 --> 00:15:46,114
Agree to my proposal

142
00:15:49,862 --> 00:15:53,127
""Mister, it"s entirely my wish""

143
00:15:57,136 --> 00:16:00,537
""Mister, it"s entirely my wish""

144
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:08,075
""l"ll give my heart to a
lover whom l will love""

145
00:16:08,481 --> 00:16:11,075
Why are you pursuing me?

146
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:58,722
l am unaware

147
00:17:00,466 --> 00:17:05,062
l am crazy

148
00:17:08,474 --> 00:17:11,807
Why are you auctioning your heart?

149
00:17:12,411 --> 00:17:15,346
""Give it to me and
l"ll be your slave""

150
00:17:19,552 --> 00:17:22,578
Why are you auctioning your heart?

151
00:17:23,489 --> 00:17:26,253
""Give it to me and
l"ll be your slave""

152
00:17:27,093 --> 00:17:30,085
l won"t fall for anyone at all

153
00:17:31,097 --> 00:17:34,089
""l"ll belong to one
who will pamper me""

154
00:17:35,101 --> 00:17:40,505
""You can"t demand the kind of
lover you want, give in to me""

155
00:17:56,122 --> 00:18:00,525
Beloved...

156
00:18:04,063 --> 00:18:09,057
l"ve lost my heart

157
00:18:12,071 --> 00:18:18,567
""l won"t fall under your spell
till l know what you"ll do for me""

158
00:18:23,082 --> 00:18:26,074
l won"t fall under your spell

159
00:18:27,086 --> 00:18:30,078
""First tell me what
you will do for me""

160
00:18:30,489 --> 00:18:33,754
Every lover gives his heart

161
00:18:34,093 --> 00:18:37,551
l will give you my life

162
00:18:38,097 --> 00:18:39,826
l won"t get conned by your words

163
00:18:40,099 --> 00:18:41,498
l"ll think and give an answer

164
00:18:42,101 --> 00:18:44,092
For this concerns my heart

165
00:18:49,108 --> 00:18:53,101
""Hey girl, give me your heart""

166
00:18:57,116 --> 00:19:00,381
""Hey you, l do as l please""

167
00:20:02,114 --> 00:20:04,105
l"ll show you how
one can buy a heart.

168
00:20:05,117 --> 00:20:09,110
A heart can only be bought
by the heart not by wealth.

169
00:20:15,127 --> 00:20:18,756
Vithal Rao and Anya kholi.

170
00:20:20,132 --> 00:20:26,537
""l often tell them, l want
to meet Balraj Rana just once""

171
00:20:27,139 --> 00:20:28,800
But they never did.

172
00:20:30,142 --> 00:20:31,803
You"re an old friend of mine.

173
00:20:32,878 --> 00:20:39,545
l also know that as of now
Balraj loves you more than a brother.

174
00:20:40,152 --> 00:20:45,146
""So if you wish, l can have
a meeting with Balraj Rana.""

175
00:20:45,658 --> 00:20:47,558
And my luck will change.

176
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,823
The drink has gone to your head.
Balraj Rana is a dangerous man.

177
00:20:52,831 --> 00:20:54,822
lt"s best you stay away from him

178
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:58,432
You"re my friend and
can"t do this much for me?

179
00:21:01,106 --> 00:21:02,835
know how long we"ve been pals?

180
00:21:03,509 --> 00:21:06,103
When l was a constable
in Dongri police station.

181
00:21:06,445 --> 00:21:08,675
And you were an ordinary
hoodlum in Bhendi Bazaar.

182
00:21:09,381 --> 00:21:11,781
l taught you the trade of extortion.

183
00:21:12,117 --> 00:21:14,278
- Remember?
- l remember everything.

184
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,520
- But you"re not in your senses.
- l am fully conscious.

185
00:21:19,124 --> 00:21:22,389
Don"t introduce us
if you don"t want to.

186
00:21:23,128 --> 00:21:24,720
lt"s no big deal.

187
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:29,123
Hold this. Do tell
Balraj Rana this..

188
00:21:30,135 --> 00:21:31,864
Be alert from tomorrow..

189
00:21:32,471 --> 00:21:36,134
Shankar kalal is being
released from jail.

190
00:21:58,163 --> 00:21:59,721
""Brother, l"m back.""

191
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:05,434
The sun of Balraj Rana"s
name won"t shine long.

192
00:22:07,106 --> 00:22:11,509
Because l"ll eclipse him out.

193
00:22:13,112 --> 00:22:15,580
As your heir...

194
00:22:16,548 --> 00:22:25,115
l"ll ascend this chair only when
l make shoes out of Balraj"s hide.

195
00:22:27,459 --> 00:22:29,120
This is my pledge.

196
00:22:32,131 --> 00:22:34,122
""Minister, now tell me
what is your problem.""

197
00:22:34,633 --> 00:22:38,125
My problem is the same as yours.

198
00:22:44,143 --> 00:22:46,634
l lost my deposit in
the last election.

199
00:22:47,146 --> 00:22:49,580
Balraj Rana was responsible for it.

200
00:22:51,483 --> 00:22:53,747
""Now that you"re back,
l don"t worry about the post.""

201
00:22:55,154 --> 00:22:58,146
l will win the next election
and become a minister.

202
00:22:59,158 --> 00:23:02,423
But we must plan something
for Balraj Rana right now.

203
00:23:03,095 --> 00:23:05,086
We don"t have to plan anything.

204
00:23:06,365 --> 00:23:09,698
Brother"s release means his ruin.

205
00:23:11,103 --> 00:23:13,094
He thinks he is the Don of Mumbai.

206
00:23:13,505 --> 00:23:15,700
But now it"s time for him to retire.

207
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:20,374
You can"t step into
the arena and fight him.

208
00:23:22,114 --> 00:23:25,845
Because today he possesses
more wealth than you.

209
00:23:26,118 --> 00:23:27,608
Also he is more powerful.

210
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,452
""Even l know that, minister.""

211
00:23:32,524 --> 00:23:35,721
The game of crime is played
with neither wealth nor power.

212
00:23:37,129 --> 00:23:38,494
But with the mind.

213
00:23:40,132 --> 00:23:46,560
""lf it"s difficult to reach the
enemy"s neck, chop off his hands.""

214
00:23:47,806 --> 00:23:49,137
He will die on his own.

215
00:23:50,142 --> 00:23:52,133
Here is your money.

216
00:23:54,646 --> 00:23:56,637
""All of a sudden,
why do you need Rs. 1000000?""

217
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,481
""come here, l"ll tell you.""

218
00:24:00,753 --> 00:24:02,414
l"m opening a beer bar in New Bombay

219
00:24:06,091 --> 00:24:10,425
No other business is as
profitable as the beer bar.

220
00:24:11,096 --> 00:24:15,590
Have ladies service and
8-10 pretty dancing girls.

221
00:24:16,101 --> 00:24:20,094
- Great.
- And print money all your life.

222
00:24:21,106 --> 00:24:22,573
What an idea!

223
00:24:24,443 --> 00:24:28,777
l get the picture. You"ll
have a special room in the bar...

224
00:24:29,114 --> 00:24:32,777
where the men make
merry with the dancers.

225
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,645
Dandekar has never lacked girls.

226
00:24:39,124 --> 00:24:40,614
The name is Dandekar.

227
00:24:42,795 --> 00:24:44,126
See you then.

228
00:25:17,095 --> 00:25:22,089
This is great. News of Akram
khan"s death is on the front page!

229
00:25:22,501 --> 00:25:23,832
Great news!

230
00:25:25,103 --> 00:25:29,096
You chopped one arm of Balraj Rana
congratulations.

231
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:33,773
This is the beginning.
congratulate me the day..

232
00:25:35,113 --> 00:25:39,106
..l make mincemeat out
of Balraj Rana"s corpse...

233
00:25:40,118 --> 00:25:43,884
and sprinkle it in every
lane and by lane of Mumbai.

234
00:25:46,124 --> 00:25:47,853
""Shankar, you"re great.""

235
00:25:49,127 --> 00:25:52,119
ln allotting me the task
of annihilating Akram khan..

236
00:25:53,131 --> 00:25:56,123
you"ve proven that the traffic
control of crime is in your hands.

237
00:25:57,135 --> 00:26:00,127
You took the supari(contract)
Now accept your reward.

238
00:26:03,742 --> 00:26:06,074
Here"s 10 million. The entire amount

239
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:13,347
- Don"t mention it.
- Our friendship is so old..

240
00:26:13,552 --> 00:26:16,077
..that l am ashamed
to accept this cash.

241
00:26:17,089 --> 00:26:20,490
But l"m quite a wretch
where cash comes in.

242
00:26:23,095 --> 00:26:26,553
""Yes and that is why, without
caring about old friendship..""

243
00:26:27,099 --> 00:26:29,829
l terminated Akram"s Pathan role.

244
00:27:23,088 --> 00:27:27,525
He was your man but
he did do some job for me.

245
00:27:29,361 --> 00:27:33,354
We were sorry to hear
about his murder.

246
00:27:36,101 --> 00:27:39,093
We are enemies but
we"re also human.

247
00:27:40,539 --> 00:27:44,532
""At this moment, we"ve come to
pay our respects to Akram Pathan.""

248
00:27:50,115 --> 00:27:53,516
The crime not noted in
the registers of the law..

249
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,783
Balraj Rana notes it in his book.

250
00:28:00,492 --> 00:28:05,054
And he himself decides the case.

251
00:28:14,806 --> 00:28:16,068
""God, protect me!""

252
00:28:20,078 --> 00:28:21,739
""Greetings, mother.""

253
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:26,812
- Greetings.
- May you live long.

254
00:28:28,086 --> 00:28:32,546
- l haven"t placed you..
- But l never met you.

255
00:28:33,091 --> 00:28:34,752
So how can you know me?

256
00:28:36,094 --> 00:28:38,858
Anyway let me introduce myself.

257
00:28:39,531 --> 00:28:43,092
My name is Neha Srivastav.
Uday and l love each other.

258
00:28:43,769 --> 00:28:45,361
l"m going to be your daughter-in-law

259
00:28:45,537 --> 00:28:49,598
Let me see who is to be
the bride of this family.

260
00:28:58,116 --> 00:29:02,712
l got it. You are Uday"s
elder brother and his wife.

261
00:29:04,056 --> 00:29:07,457
Bless me. Uday always praises you

262
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:14,056
Fine. When did your love
story with Uday begin?

263
00:29:14,733 --> 00:29:16,064
""Outdoor, just like in the films.""

264
00:29:17,069 --> 00:29:19,060
The hero and heroine
clash in a hill station.

265
00:29:19,571 --> 00:29:23,063
And fall in love and then
they even sing songs..

266
00:29:24,076 --> 00:29:26,067
You met in the outdoor..

267
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:31,072
You fell in love.
Such a big twist in the tale..

268
00:29:31,483 --> 00:29:33,348
And Uday didn"t breath a word!

269
00:29:34,086 --> 00:29:35,815
l"ll interrogate him now!

270
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:39,821
""Brother, l"m here.""

271
00:29:44,096 --> 00:29:46,496
What are you doing here?

272
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:53,094
""Don"t worry. l told your mother,
brother and his wife about us.""

273
00:29:54,773 --> 00:29:56,502
l didn"t expect this from you.

274
00:30:02,114 --> 00:30:03,581
""Brother, l"m also sorry.""

275
00:30:05,117 --> 00:30:08,712
lt"s destiny that we fell in love

276
00:30:09,121 --> 00:30:11,715
- But..
- Forget it now.

277
00:30:12,591 --> 00:30:17,551
""- The deed has been done.
- Yes, don"t be angry.""

278
00:30:18,797 --> 00:30:21,561
l don"t know about you
but l like the girl.

279
00:30:22,134 --> 00:30:26,127
lt"s not a question of approval
it"s a matter of principles.

280
00:30:28,406 --> 00:30:31,864
You ass! Falling in love is no crime.

281
00:30:32,144 --> 00:30:34,135
But it"s wrong to fall
in love and then hide it.

282
00:30:34,479 --> 00:30:37,141
And keeping it from your
brother is the worst sin!

283
00:30:37,415 --> 00:30:40,145
Meaning you don"t like Neha..

284
00:30:41,486 --> 00:30:45,616
Your choice is Number One!

285
00:30:49,427 --> 00:30:50,758
""Thank you, brother.""

286
00:30:51,163 --> 00:30:55,156
You almost scared me.
l thought the tables had turned.

287
00:30:56,168 --> 00:30:59,433
""We"ll talk later.
Hey, let"s go. - See you.""

288
00:31:37,142 --> 00:31:38,632
The heart is wild with passion

289
00:31:39,144 --> 00:31:40,543
Lost in our dreams

290
00:31:41,146 --> 00:31:44,877
""The heart is wild with passion
and we"re lost in our dreams""

291
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:46,879
Slight tremor in the eyes

292
00:31:47,152 --> 00:31:52,146
""The miracle of love,
the beloved lives in the eyes""

293
00:31:53,158 --> 00:31:56,924
""The heart is wild with passion
and we"re lost in our dreams""

294
00:31:57,495 --> 00:31:59,156
Slight tremor in the eyes

295
00:32:00,165 --> 00:32:04,101
""The miracle of love,
the beloved lives in the eyes""

296
00:32:39,537 --> 00:32:43,132
l am crazy about my beloved

297
00:32:43,575 --> 00:32:47,136
Nothing is interesting without her

298
00:32:48,146 --> 00:32:51,138
We have to cross all limits

299
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:54,483
We will love and die for love

300
00:32:59,658 --> 00:33:01,489
""The veil slips off
and the kohl runs""

301
00:33:02,093 --> 00:33:03,583
""The heart skips beats
when the anklet tinkles""

302
00:33:04,095 --> 00:33:05,687
""The veil slips off
and the kohl runs""

303
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:07,764
""The heart skips beats
when the anklet tinkles""

304
00:33:08,099 --> 00:33:11,500
Your words drive me crazy

305
00:33:12,103 --> 00:33:14,435
The miracle of love

306
00:33:54,145 --> 00:33:57,137
l want to be sacrificed for you

307
00:33:58,149 --> 00:34:01,084
l will love you all my life

308
00:34:02,087 --> 00:34:05,523
Lost in the world of dreams

309
00:34:06,091 --> 00:34:09,083
l want to sleep in your arms

310
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:16,090
""Beautiful weather, cold breeze""

311
00:34:16,501 --> 00:34:18,093
creating magic

312
00:34:18,436 --> 00:34:20,097
""Beautiful weather, cold breeze""

313
00:34:20,438 --> 00:34:22,099
creating magic

314
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:26,103
My eyes keep seeking you out

315
00:34:26,778 --> 00:34:29,110
The miracle of love

316
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:57,540
""Greetings, brother Anya.""

317
00:34:58,143 --> 00:35:02,079
- Hello. - You didn"t
introduce me to Balraj Rana.

318
00:35:03,081 --> 00:35:05,072
But today l have brought news..

319
00:35:06,084 --> 00:35:11,078
that will convince you that
l am loyal to Balraj Rana.

320
00:35:11,756 --> 00:35:14,589
""lf that be true, l"ll
take you to meet Balraj.""

321
00:35:15,093 --> 00:35:21,498
That is fine but the news l
bring should have a price.

322
00:35:22,567 --> 00:35:28,369
lf the news is true and useful
you"ll get as much cash as you want.

323
00:35:30,542 --> 00:35:37,778
Shankar kalal"s brother Nandu
terminated Akram Pathan"s role.

324
00:35:39,117 --> 00:35:41,711
""Nandu kalal, you"re finished!""

325
00:35:46,124 --> 00:35:47,853
Anya kholi here.

326
00:35:49,794 --> 00:35:54,857
Your brother Nandu is my captive.
Arrange to send him to the grave.

327
00:35:55,133 --> 00:35:59,593
""What? Look, you and
Balraj Rana are my enemies.""

328
00:35:59,871 --> 00:36:01,065
Why did you kidnap my brother?

329
00:36:01,473 --> 00:36:04,067
Have you forgotten
Akram Pathan"s murder?

330
00:36:05,076 --> 00:36:08,341
""lf you hurt my brother,
l won"t spare you and Balraj!""

331
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:13,073
lmbecile! Don"t raise your
BP yelling into the phone!

332
00:36:13,685 --> 00:36:18,088
come to Balraj Rana"s farm house
if you want to see your brother.

333
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:19,821
Get it or not?

334
00:36:24,095 --> 00:36:25,824
- What"s wrong?
- Balraj Rana kidnapped Nandu!

335
00:36:40,778 --> 00:36:42,109
The rest of you stop here.

336
00:36:45,116 --> 00:36:47,846
What is my brother"s fault?

337
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:51,111
- Why did you kidnap him?
- What wrong did he do?

338
00:36:52,123 --> 00:36:55,615
- Leave him.
- Akram too never hurt anyone.

339
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:01,062
He to was as dear to
me as my own brother.

340
00:37:10,074 --> 00:37:14,067
Now do you understand
why l asked you to come here?

341
00:37:14,746 --> 00:37:18,079
You are making a mistake.
My brother didn"t kill Akram Pathan!

342
00:37:18,349 --> 00:37:19,680
He didn"t!

343
00:37:28,092 --> 00:37:29,559
""Anya, stop!!""

344
00:37:32,096 --> 00:37:34,087
- Stop!!
- Anya kholi!!

345
00:37:41,105 --> 00:37:44,097
- Stop!!
- Screaming won"t help.

346
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:49,705
The sentence of your brother"s
death has been passed.

347
00:37:51,115 --> 00:37:54,107
""l say, ask them to stop!""

348
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,518
Stop!!

349
00:37:58,122 --> 00:38:01,455
Let me go!!

350
00:38:16,741 --> 00:38:19,073
Pablo the hood got your point.

351
00:38:19,344 --> 00:38:23,075
But Balraj Rana will never
agree to dealing in arms.

352
00:38:23,481 --> 00:38:28,475
What are you saying? l thought
Balraj was merely a pawn whose..

353
00:38:28,686 --> 00:38:30,483
remote control is in your hands.

354
00:38:31,089 --> 00:38:35,082
But your words prove that
all decisions of your gang..

355
00:38:35,493 --> 00:38:38,087
- ..are taken by Balraj Rana
- You"re absolutely right.

356
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:43,091
""When we are on the topic,
Natwar Banarasi won"t be mum.""

357
00:38:44,102 --> 00:38:48,835
""Using Vithal as a ladder, Balraj
has crowned himself the king of crime""

358
00:38:49,107 --> 00:38:51,769
And he has turned all
of us into his puppets.

359
00:38:52,543 --> 00:38:56,604
Meaning you have no
position in front of him?

360
00:39:00,118 --> 00:39:02,052
""No Pablo, that"s not true.""

361
00:39:02,453 --> 00:39:06,514
sometimes the situation and time
demands that you honour an ass..

362
00:39:06,658 --> 00:39:08,057
and fall at his feet.

363
00:39:10,061 --> 00:39:12,655
The cBl had initialed
inquiry against me.

364
00:39:13,798 --> 00:39:16,062
Any moment l could
have been reined in.

365
00:39:17,335 --> 00:39:20,793
That is why l allowed
Balraj Rana to take my seat.

366
00:39:23,574 --> 00:39:27,476
""As regards position, the
relation of guru and disciple..""

367
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:29,808
l am Balraj Rana"s superior.

368
00:39:31,082 --> 00:39:33,550
The son may acquire higher position..

369
00:39:34,085 --> 00:39:35,746
But he won"t be bigger than his Pop

370
00:39:36,487 --> 00:39:40,753
Balraj Rana is what he
is today because of me.

371
00:39:41,092 --> 00:39:43,083
Then he can"t defy you.

372
00:39:44,095 --> 00:39:49,089
Arrange a meeting with him.
l"ll convince him for the arms deal.

373
00:39:52,103 --> 00:39:53,434
All right.

374
00:39:56,107 --> 00:39:58,598
Laundering 1 .5 crores
is chicken feed for us.

375
00:40:01,112 --> 00:40:04,513
Tell the leader the
cash will reach Delhi.

376
00:40:05,116 --> 00:40:08,108
- Yes.
- Balraj..

377
00:40:14,125 --> 00:40:16,525
This is Mr. Pablo.

378
00:40:21,132 --> 00:40:23,123
You must"ve heard of Mr. Gondo

379
00:40:24,135 --> 00:40:26,899
Holy shit. Who doesn"t know him?

380
00:40:27,538 --> 00:40:31,133
He"s the biggest arms dealer
in the international market.

381
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:35,135
l"ve got you a good offer.

382
00:40:35,546 --> 00:40:39,141
""As you know, the demand for
arms has increased world over.""

383
00:40:41,152 --> 00:40:45,885
""You know, RDX and stenguns
are openly being used.""

384
00:40:46,591 --> 00:40:49,151
""And it"s needed more
specially now, at election time.""

385
00:40:50,161 --> 00:40:54,757
ls that so? But l"m not
interested in such deadly weapons.

386
00:40:55,166 --> 00:40:57,430
""But Mr. Rana,
why don"t you understand?""

387
00:40:57,835 --> 00:41:01,100
""You are the Don of this area,
the king of hawala racket.""

388
00:41:01,773 --> 00:41:05,106
Nobody can distribute arms in
the Asia region better than you.

389
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:09,102
lt"s highly profitable.
You can earn millions of dollars!

390
00:41:13,117 --> 00:41:17,110
Our culture teaches
us to honour guests.

391
00:41:18,389 --> 00:41:20,721
That is why l allow you
to leave alive.

392
00:41:24,128 --> 00:41:26,528
There"s no need to lose your shirt.

393
00:41:27,131 --> 00:41:30,123
""lf you"re not interested in arms
dealing, l"ll offer it to another.. ""

394
00:41:30,401 --> 00:41:32,130
No way!

395
00:41:34,138 --> 00:41:38,131
l won"t let you put innocent
lives on the line with anyone!

396
00:41:40,144 --> 00:41:43,477
You"re better off leaving lndia!

397
00:41:52,156 --> 00:41:56,320
Do we have any
standing in this company?

398
00:41:58,162 --> 00:42:00,153
You told me to stop
collecting extortion money.

399
00:42:00,765 --> 00:42:02,494
l stopped.

400
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:07,594
""You said, don"t deal in drugs
and l gave that up too.""

401
00:42:09,106 --> 00:42:11,097
But how long will this go on?

402
00:42:11,375 --> 00:42:15,539
l think you"ve lost your mind.

403
00:42:16,848 --> 00:42:21,114
Balraj did the right thing
by rejecting Pablo"s offer.

404
00:42:21,452 --> 00:42:23,113
You stay out of this.

405
00:42:24,121 --> 00:42:27,113
A woman branded a whore..

406
00:42:28,392 --> 00:42:30,121
...always remains a whore!

407
00:42:32,129 --> 00:42:36,122
""Even if she sings praise of God,
she wont" turn a good lady.""

408
00:42:38,135 --> 00:42:40,729
The lives of us hoods is similar.

409
00:42:42,607 --> 00:42:46,634
""Even if we do good deeds,
we will never be considered good.""

410
00:42:48,145 --> 00:42:50,875
You are a appallingly horrendous man

411
00:42:52,583 --> 00:42:56,747
l can"t change my principles
for your lousy argument.

412
00:42:57,421 --> 00:43:01,084
l merely want to know what"s
wrong in dealing in drugs or arms.

413
00:43:01,492 --> 00:43:03,426
Laundering of money too is illegal.

414
00:43:04,095 --> 00:43:07,360
We don"t kill anyone in this business

415
00:43:08,432 --> 00:43:11,094
Then give up this post
and renounce life.

416
00:43:13,104 --> 00:43:16,562
You"ve forgotten l
gave you this chair.

417
00:43:18,109 --> 00:43:22,102
l didn"t hold your finger and teach
you the basics of the crime world..

418
00:43:23,114 --> 00:43:26,106
..so you could boss me around.

419
00:43:27,118 --> 00:43:28,847
What do you think you are?

420
00:43:31,689 --> 00:43:34,123
lf l hadn"t supported you..

421
00:43:35,126 --> 00:43:38,721
you"d be rotting behind bars.

422
00:44:20,104 --> 00:44:23,096
There"s no point in thinking..

423
00:44:24,108 --> 00:44:26,099
..about Balraj Rana
slapping you in the face.

424
00:44:27,111 --> 00:44:30,444
You think about how
you can annihilate him.

425
00:44:31,115 --> 00:44:35,518
And then deal with me in arms..

426
00:44:35,786 --> 00:44:37,845
and dream of becoming
a multimillionaire!

427
00:44:38,122 --> 00:44:40,113
""Think, man.""

428
00:44:43,127 --> 00:44:47,120
But it"s not so easy
to terminate Balraj"s role.

429
00:44:48,799 --> 00:44:53,133
You must join hands with
Shankar kalal to finish him.

430
00:44:54,138 --> 00:44:56,538
""Dandekar, you seem
to have lost your mind.""

431
00:44:56,741 --> 00:44:59,539
Shankar kalal is my enemy.
Why would he join hands with me?

432
00:44:59,877 --> 00:45:04,507
circumstances influence friendship
and enmity in politics and underworld

433
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:09,481
Yesterday"s sworn enemy
can become today"s best friend.

434
00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:15,081
This is truly great news.

435
00:45:16,827 --> 00:45:19,489
lf Balraj Rana and
Vithal Rao turn foes...

436
00:45:21,098 --> 00:45:23,089
our job becomes easier.

437
00:45:24,101 --> 00:45:26,763
This enmity will finish one"s role.

438
00:45:28,105 --> 00:45:31,836
Balraj Rana slapped Vithal
to pay off his obligations.

439
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:34,600
Vithal Rao won"t spare him.

440
00:45:35,112 --> 00:45:40,106
Think about Balraj Rana who is
the uncrowned king of hawala in Asia

441
00:45:41,118 --> 00:45:42,847
He deals in millions.

442
00:45:45,122 --> 00:45:50,719
You must destroy his name and
his work to carve your own name.

443
00:45:51,862 --> 00:45:53,124
The minister is right.

444
00:45:54,131 --> 00:45:57,532
You should compromise with Vithal.

445
00:45:59,136 --> 00:46:03,072
Because Vithal knows every
secret of Balraj Rana.

446
00:46:04,075 --> 00:46:07,738
- Yes. - What?
l can"t compromise with that pig!

447
00:46:08,479 --> 00:46:10,071
""Dandekar, that is impossible!""

448
00:46:10,414 --> 00:46:15,818
You...! Open the door of
intelligence in your mind.

449
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:23,083
One can shake hands with the enemy
even if one has hatred in the heart.

450
00:46:25,096 --> 00:46:26,427
Yes.

451
00:47:10,074 --> 00:47:13,066
l"m the epitome of youth

452
00:47:17,515 --> 00:47:20,075
""Enjoy life, oh crazy guys""

453
00:47:25,089 --> 00:47:27,489
Enjoy beauty in the arms of youth

454
00:47:32,096 --> 00:47:35,088
""Enjoy life, oh crazy guys""

455
00:47:39,103 --> 00:47:42,095
l am soft but strike like lightning

456
00:47:43,107 --> 00:47:46,099
""l am a butterfly that
pleases the heart""

457
00:47:47,111 --> 00:47:50,103
""The pleasure of water
in the flames of fire""

458
00:48:34,091 --> 00:48:38,084
My heart pounds at the sight of you

459
00:48:38,596 --> 00:48:41,588
""You wield magic but
why do you stray afar?""

460
00:48:46,103 --> 00:48:48,094
Don"t come close to me

461
00:48:49,607 --> 00:48:52,098
l am as delicate as a flower

462
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:55,601
Let me go

463
00:48:57,114 --> 00:48:59,446
There"s a thorn in my heart

464
00:49:00,384 --> 00:49:03,046
l dance in gay abandon

465
00:49:04,054 --> 00:49:07,046
Drink from my eyes

466
00:49:08,058 --> 00:49:11,050
Read the tale of love in my eyes

467
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:13,521
""She twirls and dances
and gyrates and sings""

468
00:50:14,124 --> 00:50:17,525
""come here, we"ll travel together""

469
00:50:21,532 --> 00:50:24,126
Say something

470
00:50:25,135 --> 00:50:27,797
Speak openly

471
00:50:29,139 --> 00:50:31,130
l have dark tresses

472
00:50:32,142 --> 00:50:35,134
Sit in their shade

473
00:50:36,146 --> 00:50:38,478
That"s how l am

474
00:50:39,817 --> 00:50:42,479
""You tell me, how l am""

475
00:50:43,153 --> 00:50:46,145
Grab the fun of spring

476
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:05,432
come on!!

477
00:52:19,116 --> 00:52:21,107
l will leave the country!

478
00:52:23,854 --> 00:52:26,118
""For God"s sake, forgive me.""

479
00:52:27,124 --> 00:52:31,356
Don"t kill me.
l"ll give up arms dealings.

480
00:52:32,129 --> 00:52:34,791
""Balraj Rana, forgive me.""

481
00:52:38,135 --> 00:52:40,797
l might forgive my enemy.

482
00:52:42,139 --> 00:52:45,131
- But the enemy of my nation..
- No!

483
00:52:47,144 --> 00:52:49,135
l can never forgive them.

484
00:52:50,147 --> 00:52:51,637
No!!!

485
00:53:21,445 --> 00:53:23,106
""- Greetings, brother.
- Be happy.""

486
00:53:26,116 --> 00:53:28,107
- How are you?
- l"m fine.

487
00:53:28,552 --> 00:53:35,116
After ages you thought of me or did
Ajay prohibit you from meeting me?

488
00:53:35,726 --> 00:53:38,126
That"s not true and l am no child.

489
00:53:39,129 --> 00:53:40,721
that l don"t meet you
because somebody says so.

490
00:53:43,133 --> 00:53:48,127
""- How"s everyone at home?
- Mom, Pinky, everyone misses you.""

491
00:53:51,575 --> 00:53:53,736
- Studying hard?
- Very.

492
00:53:55,145 --> 00:54:01,084
""complete graduation, then l"ll
send you to US for higher education""

493
00:54:03,554 --> 00:54:06,580
Did you specially come for
some work or requirement..?

494
00:54:08,091 --> 00:54:10,559
""Yes, you might remember tomorrow
is father"s death anniversary.""

495
00:54:13,096 --> 00:54:15,428
How can l forget?

496
00:54:17,768 --> 00:54:20,100
- Mother asks you to come home.
- Tell mother...

497
00:54:21,104 --> 00:54:22,765
l will surely come.

498
00:54:23,106 --> 00:54:24,505
May l leave?

499
00:54:25,776 --> 00:54:29,371
Leaving so soon? Have dinner with me

500
00:54:29,613 --> 00:54:33,379
""No, you know we eat with mother.""

501
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:38,113
Very well. convey my
salutations to mother.

502
00:54:38,722 --> 00:54:41,555
- And give Pinky my love.
- Good bye. - Live long.

503
00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:08,682
""By the grace of God, you"re fine.""

504
00:55:09,086 --> 00:55:13,819
""Yes, you did the right thing by
bringing me to the city for treatment.""

505
00:55:15,092 --> 00:55:19,085
""Son Ajay, it"s been long. Arrange
for us to return to the village.""

506
00:55:19,363 --> 00:55:21,763
Why do you have to return so early?

507
00:55:22,532 --> 00:55:25,092
You are well but still weak.

508
00:55:25,535 --> 00:55:28,834
Stay here for a couple of months
and then go back to the village.

509
00:55:29,272 --> 00:55:32,105
""- Months..?
- Yes, stay for a while.""

510
00:55:32,609 --> 00:55:35,100
- l"ll go to the village.
- Why will you go?

511
00:55:35,512 --> 00:55:38,106
Who will look after the
fields if l also stay back?

512
00:55:38,515 --> 00:55:42,383
l don"t" know..Father l have
to go to court for a case.

513
00:55:42,786 --> 00:55:45,118
- We"ll talk about this later.
- Very well.

514
00:55:45,389 --> 00:55:47,550
""Brother, take father home. See you.""

515
00:55:48,125 --> 00:55:49,786
""- All right, son.
- come on..""

516
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:55,598
""- l"ll be back early.
- Right, son.""

517
00:56:06,076 --> 00:56:08,067
""Vithal Rao, do you follow?
Matters have gone beyond control.""

518
00:56:09,079 --> 00:56:11,070
""ln one week, this is my third boy..""

519
00:56:11,481 --> 00:56:13,813
whom Shankar kalal attacked.

520
00:56:15,085 --> 00:56:16,677
Babu Takla survived.

521
00:56:17,087 --> 00:56:20,079
But do you know what the doctor
said? He"ll never walk again!

522
00:56:23,093 --> 00:56:26,085
l"m glad Bhim and Shankar kalal
have come out in the open.

523
00:56:27,097 --> 00:56:29,088
lf the opposition is not strong
in the underworld.. - Father...

524
00:56:29,433 --> 00:56:31,094
- sit in..
- there"s no fun.

525
00:57:20,083 --> 00:57:23,484
""Son, why are you..?""

526
00:57:31,094 --> 00:57:33,494
- Good day.
- Good day to you.

527
00:57:34,097 --> 00:57:37,089
""l am Bhim kalal, elder
brother of Shankar kalal.""

528
00:57:38,368 --> 00:57:40,427
You got my brother arrested.

529
00:57:41,104 --> 00:57:44,267
Yet l took no action against you.

530
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:50,276
Because l know you
are new to this city.

531
00:57:52,115 --> 00:57:55,778
You know nothing about
my name of my profession.

532
00:57:59,589 --> 00:58:03,047
""lf l desired, l could"ve
called you to see me.""

533
00:58:05,061 --> 00:58:09,054
But give credit to my humility
l came to your door myself.

534
00:58:10,066 --> 00:58:18,064
""To explain to you, it"s foolishness
to endanger your life for others.""

535
00:58:22,078 --> 00:58:25,570
- What do you want to say?
- Bombay is a dangerous city.

536
00:58:27,083 --> 00:58:31,577
Always keep your eyes and
ears open but shut your mouth.

537
00:58:33,089 --> 00:58:35,557
Even if my brother is punished
because of your testimony..

538
00:58:37,093 --> 00:58:38,355
how will it help you?

539
00:58:39,095 --> 00:58:43,088
The government won"t award you.

540
00:58:45,502 --> 00:58:48,096
You"re a gentleman and so..

541
00:58:49,506 --> 00:58:55,604
""should stay away from a brothel,
liquor dens and affairs of hoods.""

542
00:59:01,451 --> 00:59:03,043
Yes sir. Here..

543
00:59:04,054 --> 00:59:06,318
This bag contains 5 million.

544
00:59:07,057 --> 00:59:08,547
which will be of use to you.

545
00:59:11,461 --> 00:59:14,055
Banish the thought of
testifying in court.

546
00:59:15,065 --> 00:59:18,057
And return to the village
with your parents.

547
00:59:19,069 --> 00:59:20,798
Do you follow what l"m saying?

548
00:59:34,084 --> 00:59:36,075
l"ve received your answer.

549
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:42,084
But my answer will
prove very dear to you!

550
01:00:33,543 --> 01:00:35,807
The evidence presented to court..

551
01:00:36,146 --> 01:00:38,637
""and the testimony of
eye witness, Balraj Singh Rana..""

552
01:00:39,149 --> 01:00:44,644
lt has been proven that Shankar
kalal tried to kill Vithal Rao.

553
01:00:45,155 --> 01:00:46,747
And this is a serious crime.

554
01:00:47,157 --> 01:00:51,491
""Therefore the court sentences
Shankar, son of Jagdish kalal..""

555
01:00:52,162 --> 01:00:54,653
Under Section 307
of the lndian Penal code..

556
01:00:56,166 --> 01:01:00,159
to 10 years of Rigorous lmprisonment.

557
01:01:05,375 --> 01:01:07,366
l wonder how you"ve been
living here for so many years

558
01:01:08,445 --> 01:01:10,504
This city truly is a
jungle filled with people.

559
01:01:11,381 --> 01:01:14,111
When l came here on transfer
l did find it very strange.

560
01:01:15,118 --> 01:01:17,109
But gradually l got used to it.

561
01:01:18,121 --> 01:01:20,112
There will be difference
between urban and rural life.

562
01:01:20,790 --> 01:01:23,384
You can"t find the peace
of the village here.

563
01:01:24,127 --> 01:01:26,459
""Father, take care of yourself.""

564
01:01:27,130 --> 01:01:31,123
You take care of yourself
and don"t worry about me.

565
01:01:32,135 --> 01:01:34,126
You"re always interacting with hoods.

566
01:01:43,146 --> 01:01:45,137
Father!!

567
01:01:51,154 --> 01:01:53,145
""Ajay, look after father.""

568
01:02:06,770 --> 01:02:08,101
Hurry!

569
01:02:15,111 --> 01:02:17,102
Move out!

570
01:03:34,624 --> 01:03:37,616
""Brother, l"m feeling
terrible seeing you in this state.""

571
01:03:40,296 --> 01:03:44,130
l"m not sorry about what happened.

572
01:03:46,136 --> 01:03:48,730
lf l"d let father"s
murderer get away alive..

573
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:52,131
l could never have forgiven myself.

574
01:03:54,144 --> 01:03:56,738
The court may sentence
me to life imprisonment..

575
01:03:57,147 --> 01:03:59,547
or it may hang me..

576
01:04:00,416 --> 01:04:02,680
l don"t care.

577
01:04:03,086 --> 01:04:05,077
But l care about you.

578
01:04:06,756 --> 01:04:12,092
The case weakens if there"s
no eye witness in a murder..

579
01:04:14,097 --> 01:04:15,758
Balraj killed Bhim kalal.

580
01:04:16,099 --> 01:04:17,430
Nobody saw that.

581
01:04:18,535 --> 01:04:22,437
He saved my life hence
l"m here to save him.

582
01:04:23,106 --> 01:04:26,439
""Attorney, show the
inspector the bail order.""

583
01:04:28,111 --> 01:04:29,510
Here you are.

584
01:04:36,853 --> 01:04:38,115
Leave him.

585
01:04:38,721 --> 01:04:43,624
You"ve done me a big favour
by saving me from death.

586
01:04:45,728 --> 01:04:47,719
That is why l bailed you out.

587
01:04:48,131 --> 01:04:52,124
Don"t fear. Murder case
decisions take years in lndia.

588
01:04:52,802 --> 01:04:55,464
""By then, we"ll play some game
and get the judge on our side.""

589
01:04:56,806 --> 01:04:58,467
But we won"t let you be punished.

590
01:04:59,142 --> 01:05:01,076
What plans do you
have for the future?

591
01:05:02,679 --> 01:05:05,079
This city snatched my
father away from me.

592
01:05:08,084 --> 01:05:12,077
l"ll take mother and
return to the village.

593
01:05:12,589 --> 01:05:14,079
You can"t go anywhere.

594
01:05:15,091 --> 01:05:20,085
kalal company will follow you
like death everywhere you go.

595
01:05:21,664 --> 01:05:25,100
And they"ll try to kill you
whenever they get a chance.

596
01:05:28,104 --> 01:05:29,765
Your father"s murder was an accident.

597
01:05:30,273 --> 01:05:32,764
You were their target.

598
01:05:34,110 --> 01:05:36,101
And you"re still alive.

599
01:05:37,547 --> 01:05:45,113
They can attack your brother
if you move off to the village.

600
01:05:46,122 --> 01:05:48,852
This nuisance is now
part of your family.

601
01:05:49,792 --> 01:05:51,783
Anyone can land anywhere.

602
01:05:52,395 --> 01:05:57,128
One has to be ready all the
time to deal with kalal company.

603
01:05:57,634 --> 01:06:02,071
lf you want to live and
save your family from death...

604
01:06:04,073 --> 01:06:05,563
make this your partner.

605
01:06:43,112 --> 01:06:44,511
May you live long.

606
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:19,071
""Sir, sprinkle water on these.""

607
01:07:24,087 --> 01:07:26,419
Now offer them milk and honey.

608
01:07:40,103 --> 01:07:42,094
Place the grass on your ear

609
01:07:46,109 --> 01:07:48,100
Now take the lump of
flour in your hand.

610
01:08:08,064 --> 01:08:10,396
Take some flowers in your hands.

611
01:08:18,074 --> 01:08:20,474
Offer flowers to your departed father

612
01:08:26,749 --> 01:08:28,842
- Please get some milk.
- Yes.

613
01:08:31,087 --> 01:08:33,612
""Mother, you get some holy water.""

614
01:08:34,090 --> 01:08:35,489
Very well.

615
01:08:37,427 --> 01:08:41,420
Pray to God for the
peace of your father"s soul.

616
01:09:02,051 --> 01:09:03,450
Brother!!

617
01:09:43,092 --> 01:09:45,583
You won"t be harmed!

618
01:09:46,095 --> 01:09:49,087
My son!!

619
01:09:50,099 --> 01:09:53,091
""My son, you won"t be harmed!""

620
01:10:22,131 --> 01:10:25,123
""- How is my brother?
- Doctor, how is my son?""

621
01:10:26,135 --> 01:10:27,796
- ls he well?
- There"s no cause for worry.

622
01:10:28,137 --> 01:10:29,729
The operation was successful.

623
01:10:30,139 --> 01:10:32,801
You can meet your son
once he is conscious.

624
01:10:34,143 --> 01:10:36,134
""- Mother, sit down.
- Mr. Ajay, just a moment..""

625
01:10:39,749 --> 01:10:44,812
Nothing can be said as yet.
lf Balraj gains senses in 8 hours..

626
01:10:45,154 --> 01:10:48,487
then he"ll survive.
Otherwise anything can happen.

627
01:12:08,104 --> 01:12:11,096
l made no mistake in
killing Balraj Rana.

628
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:13,840
But the fella didn"t die
even after taking in 20 bullets.

629
01:12:14,276 --> 01:12:15,709
lt"s not my fault.

630
01:12:16,112 --> 01:12:19,775
lt is. cops have to
account for every bullet.

631
01:12:21,450 --> 01:12:23,281
Why were so stingy
in firing bullets?

632
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:27,518
Did you have to give the
account of bullets to us?

633
01:12:31,127 --> 01:12:34,119
Why didn"t you shoot
him from head to toe!!

634
01:12:35,131 --> 01:12:38,396
He"s still caught
between life and death.

635
01:12:39,135 --> 01:12:42,571
""lf he survives, it will
be a nuisance for all of us!""

636
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:46,802
""Next time, l won"t spare him!""

637
01:12:47,143 --> 01:12:49,134
Who has seen next time?

638
01:12:50,646 --> 01:12:54,138
You put all of us in trouble
by playing half the game.

639
01:13:04,093 --> 01:13:08,086
Please forgive me.
l"ll never make another mistake.

640
01:13:45,735 --> 01:13:49,136
These days computers make
pictures by mere description.

641
01:13:49,472 --> 01:13:51,463
That is why l shaved his head.

642
01:13:52,408 --> 01:13:54,137
Now nobody will recognise him.

643
01:13:57,146 --> 01:13:59,876
You must have seen
the face of the killer.

644
01:14:01,083 --> 01:14:07,352
l recall it very well.
l can identify him among hundreds.

645
01:14:11,093 --> 01:14:13,357
Good day mother.
Sister-in-law..

646
01:14:14,096 --> 01:14:18,089
- come in.
- l want to meet Sir.

647
01:14:21,103 --> 01:14:24,095
l want to talk to you
about the Balraj Rana case.

648
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:26,772
""- What is it?
- Sir, l have information..""

649
01:14:27,109 --> 01:14:30,101
Vithal Rao who was Balraj
Rana"s friend till recently..

650
01:14:30,646 --> 01:14:32,773
""These days, he"s good
friends with Shankar kalal.""

651
01:14:35,117 --> 01:14:36,709
What are you implying?

652
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:41,112
""When a friend makes friends with
the foe, he"s no more a friend.""

653
01:14:42,124 --> 01:14:44,388
l think the murderous
attempt of Balraj Rana..

654
01:14:45,528 --> 01:14:48,725
Shankar kalal and Vithal Rao
together have a hand in it.

655
01:14:49,131 --> 01:14:51,395
""lf you order, l"ll arrest them.""

656
01:14:51,534 --> 01:14:54,128
On what grounds will you arrest them?

657
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:58,135
We have neither evidence
nor any witness against them.

658
01:14:59,141 --> 01:15:01,803
You"ll arrest them but they"ll
get out on benefit of doubt.

659
01:15:02,077 --> 01:15:04,068
and we won"t be able to do anything!

660
01:15:06,081 --> 01:15:10,745
Does this mean the law will never
nab those who tried to kill brother?

661
01:15:11,086 --> 01:15:13,418
Your thinking is wrong.

662
01:15:14,089 --> 01:15:16,080
The criminal maybe
exceptionally smart...

663
01:15:16,358 --> 01:15:18,622
His end is at the feet of law.

664
01:15:20,362 --> 01:15:23,092
But some criminals
never leave any trace.

665
01:15:23,599 --> 01:15:25,567
Shankar kalal and
Vithal Rao are one of those.

666
01:15:26,101 --> 01:15:29,502
""lf you keep waiting for evidence
and witness, you can"t touch them.""

667
01:15:31,106 --> 01:15:35,099
""l say, throw them both in jail.""

668
01:15:35,711 --> 01:15:39,511
Thrash them so hard that
they confess to their crime.

669
01:15:40,115 --> 01:15:43,516
l know very well what l
must and what l mustn"t do.

670
01:15:44,119 --> 01:15:46,110
Don"t teach me my duty.

671
01:15:46,388 --> 01:15:50,119
l"m not preaching but the truth is
you don"t" want to do anything!

672
01:15:50,526 --> 01:15:53,120
Despite the injured man
being your real brother...

673
01:15:53,529 --> 01:15:56,123
""ln your eyes, he"s only a criminal!""

674
01:15:56,532 --> 01:15:57,863
Only a criminal!

675
01:15:58,234 --> 01:16:00,532
What nonsense is this?

676
01:16:01,070 --> 01:16:03,061
ls this the way to talk
to an elder brother?

677
01:16:04,073 --> 01:16:07,065
Ajay hates Balraj"s
profession not him.

678
01:16:08,077 --> 01:16:13,071
Do you think he isn"t sorry
for all that happened to Balraj?

679
01:16:15,084 --> 01:16:20,249
Don"t stop him. Let him
say whatever he wants.

680
01:16:21,090 --> 01:16:24,082
Don"t let his words hurt you.

681
01:16:25,594 --> 01:16:28,586
He"s just a child. lt"s getting
late. You must go to your office.

682
01:16:30,833 --> 01:16:32,824
He said all that he had to.

683
01:16:33,769 --> 01:16:36,101
Now let me explain
some things to him.

684
01:16:38,274 --> 01:16:41,766
""Uday, you have some wrong
notions in your mind about me.""

685
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:43,373
lt doesn"t matter to me.

686
01:16:45,781 --> 01:16:49,273
Balraj Rana and l do share
the relation of cop and thief.

687
01:16:49,451 --> 01:16:51,112
Only of a cop and a thief.

688
01:16:52,721 --> 01:16:57,124
My duty is more important
and dear to me than relations.

689
01:16:59,128 --> 01:17:03,064
Whatever happened to Balraj Rana
is the result of his own deeds.

690
01:17:06,068 --> 01:17:08,468
Those who shower bullets on others..

691
01:17:09,071 --> 01:17:11,562
they must also bear the
bullets on their own chest.

692
01:17:12,074 --> 01:17:15,066
This is the rule of the world
that nobody can change!

693
01:17:17,746 --> 01:17:19,077
""Gautam, let"s go.""

694
01:17:28,090 --> 01:17:31,082
This is Pratap kalal here...
Pratap kalal

695
01:17:32,094 --> 01:17:34,085
Where"s your heroine?

696
01:17:35,097 --> 01:17:38,089
l"ve emptied a whole bottle
waiting for her

697
01:17:39,101 --> 01:17:41,092
But she still hasn"t got here

698
01:17:41,437 --> 01:17:46,431
""l told you, l"ll manage
the finance for you""

699
01:17:48,110 --> 01:17:53,514
""Arrange for some fun for me,
l"ll raise the cash for you""

700
01:17:55,117 --> 01:17:58,109
Listen to that!
Looks like Sundari has arrived

701
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:00,454
""l"ll talk to you later, okay?""

702
01:18:02,157 --> 01:18:05,058
Hey Raju...
- Yes?

703
01:18:05,394 --> 01:18:10,058
Open the door.
Looks like Sundari is here

704
01:18:10,399 --> 01:18:11,661
Rightaway

705
01:18:23,479 --> 01:18:24,810
Who"s that...?

706
01:19:16,065 --> 01:19:20,229
""Hit me all you want to.
l, Pratap kalal...""

707
01:19:20,736 --> 01:19:25,605
am Shankar kalal"s brother.
None of you will remain alive

708
01:19:25,841 --> 01:19:28,401
Eunuch! You threaten us?

709
01:19:28,744 --> 01:19:31,406
What harm will you or
your brother do to us?

710
01:19:33,782 --> 01:19:38,082
""lf you are Shankar kalal"s brother,
l"m Balraj Rana"s brother""

711
01:19:54,136 --> 01:19:56,434
Phone your brother. Go on!

712
01:20:00,142 --> 01:20:03,111
lt"s difficult for Balraj Rana to
get out of this sticky situation

713
01:20:03,779 --> 01:20:06,373
His role is surely going
to be finished

714
01:20:09,685 --> 01:20:12,677
Brother... this is Pratap here

715
01:20:13,188 --> 01:20:15,622
""What is the matter, Pratap?
Where are you calling from?""

716
01:20:15,924 --> 01:20:17,721
Why are you sounding so scared?

717
01:20:23,432 --> 01:20:28,426
""When death stares you in the face,
the best of gangsters lose their tongue""

718
01:20:29,138 --> 01:20:32,596
Who are you?
- Balraj Rana"s brother. Uday

719
01:20:34,676 --> 01:20:37,144
lf something happens to my brother...

720
01:20:37,579 --> 01:20:42,141
""l"ll gift-wrap your brother"s body
and send it to you, Shankar kalal""

721
01:20:46,155 --> 01:20:48,146
What"s up?
Whose call was it?

722
01:20:48,423 --> 01:20:50,823
""Balraj Rana"s brother, Uday""

723
01:20:53,562 --> 01:20:57,362
That bastard has kidnapped Pratap

724
01:21:00,769 --> 01:21:02,498
lqbal...
- Yes?

725
01:21:02,671 --> 01:21:04,605
Get the car out

726
01:21:05,107 --> 01:21:07,098
Where are you going...?

727
01:21:08,177 --> 01:21:11,271
Shankar! Where are you going?
Stop there!

728
01:21:13,115 --> 01:21:17,779
Let me go!
- Don"t be mad! Listen to us

729
01:21:18,187 --> 01:21:20,280
""Don"t block my path,
let me go!""

730
01:21:20,455 --> 01:21:23,117
That bastard dares abduct
my brother!

731
01:21:23,458 --> 01:21:26,791
""l"ll wipe out his entire lineage!
- come to your senses, Shankar""

732
01:21:27,129 --> 01:21:31,532
""Man makes mistakes in a fit of fury.
- Don"t worry, we"re here""

733
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:34,735
You think Uday has hidden Pratap
in his house?

734
01:21:35,137 --> 01:21:38,538
""lf not his house, l"ll find him at
least in Balraj Rana"s bungalow""

735
01:21:38,807 --> 01:21:40,536
Let me go!
- Wait here

736
01:21:40,876 --> 01:21:44,141
Don"t be mad! There"s a
red alert in the city...

737
01:21:44,413 --> 01:21:46,813
there are blockades everywhere.
Where will you go?

738
01:21:46,949 --> 01:21:49,816
""He"s right, Shankar. Gangwar has
already broken out in the city""

739
01:21:50,152 --> 01:21:55,146
True. Balraj Rana"s boys bumped off
five of our men at a beer bar

740
01:21:55,324 --> 01:21:57,292
lt"s dangerous for you to go out
at this hour

741
01:21:57,426 --> 01:22:00,486
So you guys want me to sit here
and wait for my brother"s body?

742
01:22:00,696 --> 01:22:04,097
""Listen, Shankar. Your brother
is like my brother""

743
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:09,093
""As long as l"m around,
Uday cannot finish his role""

744
01:22:09,504 --> 01:22:12,098
""l"m a police officer,
l can easily walk into any place""

745
01:22:12,441 --> 01:22:16,104
l"ll go and find out where
Uday has hidden Pratap

746
01:22:16,445 --> 01:22:18,777
Dandekar is right.
Let him do this job

747
01:22:19,114 --> 01:22:21,446
Go on.
- Okay? l"ll go right now

748
01:22:30,492 --> 01:22:35,122
""Mc, can"t you make a drink?
This is nothing but soda""

749
01:22:35,430 --> 01:22:38,422
""Sorry, sir. l"ll make another.
- Pour some whisky""

750
01:22:46,642 --> 01:22:49,133
""This is the first time
you call me an Mc, sir""

751
01:22:49,478 --> 01:22:52,470
So what happened?
Was l wrong?

752
01:22:52,881 --> 01:22:56,476
""You abused me, sir.
- Abuse?""

753
01:22:57,219 --> 01:23:00,416
You have misinterpreted
my words

754
01:23:01,590 --> 01:23:04,491
Tell me... what is your name?
- Mangesh chauhan

755
01:23:04,826 --> 01:23:09,092
So what"s the shortform for
Mangesh chauhan? M.c... right?

756
01:23:11,366 --> 01:23:16,429
""You are right, sir!
He has no brains in his skull""

757
01:23:16,838 --> 01:23:22,105
How"s your beer bar at New Mumbai
doing sir? ls all well?

758
01:23:22,444 --> 01:23:26,608
""kadam, l"m going to open a dozen
beer-bars in Mumbai now""

759
01:23:26,782 --> 01:23:29,774
""A dozen beer-bars...?
Where"ll you find the dough, sir?""

760
01:23:30,218 --> 01:23:34,678
""Bodke, l follow a rule. As long
as l wear this uniform...""

761
01:23:35,123 --> 01:23:38,115
l will make as much dough
as possible

762
01:23:38,627 --> 01:23:42,791
""So that after l retire, there should
be no dearth of cash and fun""

763
01:23:48,203 --> 01:23:50,467
lf it"s Shankar kalal...

764
01:23:50,739 --> 01:23:53,537
tell him that the officer is out
on a round-up

765
01:23:54,142 --> 01:23:55,837
Just round him up. Go!

766
01:23:59,915 --> 01:24:01,849
Shankar kalal here.
Give the phone to Dandekar

767
01:24:02,184 --> 01:24:05,415
""Mr Dandekar is not here.
He"s away on a round-up, sir""

768
01:24:05,620 --> 01:24:07,611
Ask him to give me a call
when he returns

769
01:24:07,756 --> 01:24:11,089
""l"ll be at the kauva.
- Sure, l"ll tell him""

770
01:24:13,495 --> 01:24:19,491
""Sir, it was Shankar kalal. He has
asked you to call him at the kauva""

771
01:24:20,102 --> 01:24:23,094
""But, sir... what does
a kauva mean?""

772
01:24:24,106 --> 01:24:27,769
""ln underworld parlance, a kauva
is a mobile phone""

773
01:24:29,511 --> 01:24:34,107
""May l ask you something, sir?
Shankar kalal is your friend""

774
01:24:34,583 --> 01:24:40,112
So why did you ask kadam to lie
that you"re away on a round-up?

775
01:24:40,389 --> 01:24:45,122
That filthy scumbag! What friend...?
He"s a bloody gangster

776
01:24:46,128 --> 01:24:50,326
Balraj Rana"s younger brother
has kidnapped his younger brother

777
01:24:50,899 --> 01:24:54,460
One gangster"s brother has kidnapped
another gangster"s brother

778
01:24:55,137 --> 01:24:57,901
So why must l fall into the mess
and ruin my sleep?

779
01:24:58,240 --> 01:24:59,901
All l want is...

780
01:25:01,143 --> 01:25:03,737
""Right, sir! You are right!""

781
01:25:12,421 --> 01:25:17,085
l kept searching the places of all
Uday"s friends last night

782
01:25:18,093 --> 01:25:20,323
But there was no trace of Pratap

783
01:25:22,097 --> 01:25:25,089
""Make a call and find
out, Mr Dandekar""

784
01:25:25,434 --> 01:25:28,096
""ls Balraj Rana at least alive,
or is he already dead?""

785
01:25:36,645 --> 01:25:38,772
This is lnspector Dandekar here.
- Yes?

786
01:25:39,181 --> 01:25:43,584
What"s the condition of the patient
in ward 504 of the lcU?

787
01:25:44,119 --> 01:25:47,111
""Hold on, lnspector. l"ll check
the register and tell you""

788
01:25:48,123 --> 01:25:50,455
She"ll check and tell me.
- All right

789
01:25:53,128 --> 01:25:55,460
""lnspector, that patient is dead""

790
01:25:55,897 --> 01:25:58,127
What !
- What happened?

791
01:25:58,467 --> 01:26:02,403
Balraj Rana"s role is finished.
He"s no more

792
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:07,572
""Shankar, be patient""

793
01:26:11,246 --> 01:26:13,646
Looks like your brother"s
dead body has arrived

794
01:26:48,283 --> 01:26:49,272
Brother...?

795
01:26:55,257 --> 01:26:57,521
""Pratap, are you all right?""

796
01:26:58,126 --> 01:27:03,462
""Thank God, he let him go alive.
But how did he do that...?""

797
01:27:04,065 --> 01:27:06,056
Balraj Rana"s...
- He"s alive

798
01:27:06,268 --> 01:27:11,467
What? He"s alive despite
taking all those bullets?

799
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:13,831
lsn"t he dead yet?

800
01:27:15,076 --> 01:27:18,671
That boy Uday shouldn"t
have interfered...

801
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:21,742
in this fracas between me
and Balraj Rana

802
01:27:23,084 --> 01:27:25,348
He hasn"t done the right thing

803
01:27:26,221 --> 01:27:28,689
l"ve found out everything
from Dandekar

804
01:27:29,157 --> 01:27:33,093
Vithal Rao has gone and
ganged up with Shankar kalal

805
01:27:33,895 --> 01:27:37,626
The two of them sent out a contract
killer to have you bumped off

806
01:27:39,100 --> 01:27:43,093
But l haven"t been silent either.
l had Mumbai closed down

807
01:27:43,371 --> 01:27:46,101
l had many of their boys
bumped off

808
01:27:49,711 --> 01:27:52,111
Stop all this for a few days

809
01:27:53,114 --> 01:27:57,778
""Because the chief Minister is our
man, so is the government of the day""

810
01:27:59,654 --> 01:28:05,058
The opposition can make an issue
out of gangwar and create trouble

811
01:28:06,194 --> 01:28:07,525
""come, Uday""

812
01:28:09,197 --> 01:28:11,859
""My respects, brother.
- How are you?""

813
01:28:12,133 --> 01:28:16,661
l"m okay. How are you?
- Much better. How"s mother?

814
01:28:17,072 --> 01:28:21,065
She keeps praying for your recovery.
And God has heard her prayers

815
01:28:21,476 --> 01:28:25,412
lt"s thanks to her blessings
that l"ve survived

816
01:28:26,081 --> 01:28:30,245
Tomorrow"s the Ganpati festival.
Have you brought an idol?

817
01:28:30,518 --> 01:28:33,578
""l"ll bring such a huge idol,
it"s going to stun you!""

818
01:28:34,089 --> 01:28:37,855
What l regret is that you will
not be able to attend this year

819
01:28:38,226 --> 01:28:40,751
Don"t be sad. lf not
at the beginning...

820
01:28:41,162 --> 01:28:44,495
l"ll be there for the immersion.
- He"s right

821
01:28:44,866 --> 01:28:48,427
""With Lord Ganesha"s blessings,
he"ll be all right by then""

822
01:28:48,703 --> 01:28:52,104
Praise be to Lord Ganesha!

823
01:30:22,130 --> 01:30:26,624
""The Lord of the masses has arrived,
Lord Ganesha is here""

824
01:30:27,202 --> 01:30:30,137
""So let there be revelry,
merry-making...""

825
01:30:30,371 --> 01:30:33,363
let"s play the band together

826
01:30:39,180 --> 01:30:43,810
""The Lord of the masses has arrived,
Lord Ganesha is here""

827
01:30:44,753 --> 01:30:47,745
""So let there be revelry,
merry-making...""

828
01:30:47,922 --> 01:30:50,686
let"s play the band together

829
01:31:35,837 --> 01:31:40,672
Your arrival brings happiness...

830
01:31:41,209 --> 01:31:46,146
""we play the drums,
we play the daph""

831
01:31:46,748 --> 01:31:50,149
""The earth and the skies sway,
our hearts are filled with joy""

832
01:31:50,318 --> 01:31:53,481
""Your devotees are all
taken up with the mood of revelry""

833
01:31:53,822 --> 01:31:56,757
""You are the benevolent Lord,
the vanquisher of evil...""

834
01:31:57,158 --> 01:31:59,820
that"s Lord Ganesha

835
01:32:00,161 --> 01:32:05,098
""The Lord of the masses has arrived,
Lord Ganesha is here""

836
01:32:30,892 --> 01:32:35,625
""He who surrenders
at Your feet, Lord...""

837
01:32:36,130 --> 01:32:41,124
finds every happiness in life

838
01:32:41,669 --> 01:32:44,729
""You are the one who protects
those who grieve""

839
01:32:45,206 --> 01:32:48,403
""Grant us Your grace,
may You be praised, Lord""

840
01:32:48,676 --> 01:32:51,804
""Every time darkness has taken over
and there is peril...""

841
01:32:52,146 --> 01:32:54,740
""You are the only saviour, Ganesha""

842
01:32:55,617 --> 01:33:00,145
""The Lord of the masses has arrived,
Lord Ganesha is here""

843
01:36:40,001 --> 01:36:42,231
Who the hell is he?
And what"s all this?

844
01:36:42,637 --> 01:36:46,903
""Recognise him, brother! He"s the one
who shot at our elder brother""

845
01:36:47,242 --> 01:36:49,233
He tried to kill me today

846
01:37:11,099 --> 01:37:13,932
Your law couldn"t catch up
with him...

847
01:37:14,202 --> 01:37:17,194
but l hope it"s not unsuccessful
in punishing him

848
01:37:21,543 --> 01:37:23,875
""Gautam, lock him up""

849
01:37:36,624 --> 01:37:40,890
l"ve been very afraid over
the last few days

850
01:37:44,265 --> 01:37:46,563
lf something happens to you
in this fight...

851
01:37:47,569 --> 01:37:49,901
it"ll all be over for me

852
01:37:51,639 --> 01:37:58,568
""Uday, can"t you possibly distance
yourself from this gangwar?""

853
01:37:59,581 --> 01:38:04,109
A gangwar it is for the police
and the media. Not for me

854
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:08,853
lt"s a fight for my family.
May l ask you something...?

855
01:38:09,524 --> 01:38:13,517
Do you have faith in your love?
So nothing will happen to me

856
01:38:15,997 --> 01:38:18,864
Trust me. Everything
will be all right

857
01:38:24,539 --> 01:38:29,738
""Speak! lt was Shankar kalal who sent
you to kill Balraj Rana, isn"t it?""

858
01:38:30,111 --> 01:38:31,544
Speak!

859
01:38:31,713 --> 01:38:34,546
""l don"t know any Shankar kalal, sir.
- You don"t...?""

860
01:38:36,651 --> 01:38:39,279
you don"t...?

861
01:38:49,564 --> 01:38:54,729
You aren"t made of iron.
You will break and you will speak

862
01:38:56,070 --> 01:39:01,064
AcP Rana makes even
the dead speak

863
01:39:01,342 --> 01:39:07,508
You"re still alive. You will yourself
tell me who had sent you

864
01:39:09,584 --> 01:39:14,851
l give you tonight to tell me.
Lock him up!

865
01:40:11,079 --> 01:40:13,070
You get it?

866
01:40:21,122 --> 01:40:24,523
""Dinner time, guys.
Hurry up""

867
01:40:27,862 --> 01:40:30,854
Give him the food.
- Get up and eat

868
01:40:44,545 --> 01:40:47,878
""Not a step further...
Else, l"ll shoot him!""

869
01:40:48,616 --> 01:40:52,143
""Don"t you try to escape!
Else, l"ll shoot""

870
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:54,880
Piss off! You can"t shoot me!

871
01:40:55,289 --> 01:40:58,884
l"ll spill his brains out

872
01:41:01,629 --> 01:41:04,564
l"ll bump him off
if anyone gets closer

873
01:41:06,634 --> 01:41:08,158
No closer

874
01:41:28,923 --> 01:41:31,858
Your role is finished Raghu Shetty

875
01:41:35,530 --> 01:41:38,192
lf Raghu Shetty was taking
constable Mangesh as a hostage...

876
01:41:38,533 --> 01:41:42,094
you could"ve shot at his legs.
But you shot him in the back...

877
01:41:42,203 --> 01:41:43,693
and killed him!

878
01:41:46,874 --> 01:41:52,540
What price were you paid to kill
Raghu Shetty in the escape drama?

879
01:41:53,047 --> 01:41:58,212
Answer me! How much have you sold
your duty and your uniform for?

880
01:41:58,553 --> 01:42:02,887
""You are making a cheap accusation
against me without any proof, sir""

881
01:42:05,159 --> 01:42:08,959
You are the black sheep l was
looking for in this khaki uniform

882
01:42:09,564 --> 01:42:12,158
lt"s because of officers like you
that the police force...

883
01:42:12,500 --> 01:42:14,695
has been reduced to a joke!

884
01:42:16,504 --> 01:42:19,837
""You have no right to yell
at me like this, sir""

885
01:42:20,107 --> 01:42:22,769
Don"t tell me about my rights!

886
01:42:24,779 --> 01:42:28,977
The day l find a single shred
of evidence against you...

887
01:42:29,517 --> 01:42:32,509
l will publicly strip you
of your uniform...

888
01:42:32,687 --> 01:42:36,020
and show your misdeeds
on national television

889
01:42:36,524 --> 01:42:41,518
So that your state serves as a lesson
to other dishonest officers like you

890
01:42:48,903 --> 01:42:53,863
""ln the presence of my junior officers
and my constables, he abused me!""

891
01:42:54,542 --> 01:42:56,874
He called me a black sheep!

892
01:42:57,712 --> 01:43:02,706
He"ll now discover what a bastard
this black sheep is

893
01:43:03,551 --> 01:43:07,043
""Shankar, till now, he was
fighting against you guys""

894
01:43:07,822 --> 01:43:13,488
""But now, he"s against me.
l"ll ruin is entire family!""

895
01:43:16,831 --> 01:43:21,495
""Do what you want to, Dandekar.
l"m with you""

896
01:43:26,173 --> 01:43:30,507
""can l speak to Uday, please?
- Uday here. Who are you?""

897
01:43:30,745 --> 01:43:33,111
l"m your elder brother"s good friend

898
01:43:33,514 --> 01:43:35,277
Elder brother"s friend?

899
01:43:48,696 --> 01:43:52,962
The name is Munna Tiwari.
l was the one who telephoned you

900
01:43:53,601 --> 01:43:56,092
But l"ve never seen you
with my elder brother

901
01:43:56,270 --> 01:43:58,135
You don"t understand

902
01:43:58,306 --> 01:44:02,538
Balraj has special men
for special jobs

903
01:44:03,544 --> 01:44:09,881
You wanted to give me evidence against
those who tried to kill him

904
01:44:10,551 --> 01:44:13,884
""Evidence...?
come with me, l"ll show you""

905
01:44:19,627 --> 01:44:21,857
There you are

906
01:44:26,567 --> 01:44:29,229
They"re stenguns.
What will l do with them?

907
01:44:35,576 --> 01:44:38,067
Stengun! An Ak56 ?

908
01:44:40,047 --> 01:44:42,174
""lt isn"t my gun, sir...
it belongs to him""

909
01:44:42,383 --> 01:44:44,578
lt"s not my gun

910
01:44:45,619 --> 01:44:48,986
Well? Where did you get
the weapons from?

911
01:44:49,724 --> 01:44:52,921
""The master would know.
l"m just a servant, sir""

912
01:44:53,260 --> 01:44:56,593
l don"t know where he got them from.
- What rubbish!

913
01:44:57,264 --> 01:45:00,165
""lnspector, he"s the one who
telephoned me and called me here""

914
01:45:00,601 --> 01:45:01,932
He"s lying!

915
01:45:02,269 --> 01:45:05,534
Really? So he called you here?

916
01:45:07,641 --> 01:45:10,542
Don"t raise your voice with me!
Arrest him!

917
01:45:12,613 --> 01:45:15,207
""lnspector, you know
who l am?""

918
01:45:15,750 --> 01:45:21,882
""No, l don"t know who you are.
Anyone of you knows who he is?""

919
01:45:22,823 --> 01:45:26,224
""Sir, he"s AcP Ajay"s
younger brother""

920
01:45:28,829 --> 01:45:31,559
""Forgive me, l"ve made a mistake""

921
01:45:33,567 --> 01:45:37,560
""Please don"t complain to your brother,
or l"ll lose my job""

922
01:45:44,645 --> 01:45:47,978
You"re throwing your weight around with
me because your brother is an AcP?

923
01:45:48,916 --> 01:45:53,148
""ln the eyes of the law,
everyone is an equal""

924
01:45:53,654 --> 01:45:56,088
Your brother will be able
to do nothing...

925
01:45:56,257 --> 01:45:58,782
because you have been
caught red-handed

926
01:46:02,296 --> 01:46:05,129
My name is Nazir kaskar.
l"m a builder by profession

927
01:46:05,599 --> 01:46:07,863
All these buildings
were made by me

928
01:46:08,536 --> 01:46:10,902
This car has been here
for a very long time...

929
01:46:11,305 --> 01:46:14,536
and these boys were chatting away

930
01:46:14,875 --> 01:46:20,541
""l got suspicious.
Bad times nowadays, lnspector""

931
01:46:21,215 --> 01:46:24,150
That car could even have RDX.
Or maybe bombs

932
01:46:24,652 --> 01:46:28,554
So l telephoned you
and called you over

933
01:46:28,856 --> 01:46:32,849
l"ll tell you the whole truth.
l work for Balraj

934
01:46:33,260 --> 01:46:37,026
And it"s true that these weapons
belong to Balraj too

935
01:46:37,565 --> 01:46:40,557
Uday came here and asked me
to hide the weapons somewhere

936
01:46:41,235 --> 01:46:45,137
""l said, it"s okay that l work
for Balraj...""

937
01:46:45,573 --> 01:46:48,565
but l can"t invite danger by
hiding these deadly weapons!

938
01:46:48,909 --> 01:46:52,003
""We were talking it over
when you arrived, sir...""

939
01:46:52,580 --> 01:46:56,175
He"s lying!
The scoundrel is a liar!

940
01:47:20,207 --> 01:47:22,539
Leave him alone! Let go!

941
01:47:33,787 --> 01:47:36,221
Your role is going
to be finished now

942
01:47:36,557 --> 01:47:38,548
You"re going to be sent away
under TADA

943
01:47:38,692 --> 01:47:41,559
You will spend your life
behind bars

944
01:47:42,096 --> 01:47:46,556
""When you are released,
your hair will all be gray""

945
01:47:47,234 --> 01:47:49,099
Take him away!

946
01:48:01,782 --> 01:48:04,580
How long have you been
working with Balraj Rana?

947
01:48:09,190 --> 01:48:10,521
Speak!

948
01:48:10,658 --> 01:48:13,855
""l told you,
l don"t work for him""

949
01:48:14,195 --> 01:48:18,529
You are lying! Where did you get
so many foreign-made guns from?

950
01:48:20,201 --> 01:48:23,693
l have nothing to do with the guns!
- Nothing...?

951
01:48:28,876 --> 01:48:32,539
You think because you"re the
Additional commissioner"s brother...

952
01:48:32,680 --> 01:48:38,209
you will do what you want to?
That nobody will catch you?

953
01:48:44,592 --> 01:48:50,087
The law spares no one. Whether it is
the Additional commissioner"s brother...

954
01:48:51,632 --> 01:48:55,898
or the Prime Minister"s. The law does
what it ought to do!

955
01:49:04,745 --> 01:49:05,734
God!

956
01:49:05,846 --> 01:49:07,006
Sir...

957
01:49:08,616 --> 01:49:11,517
""Sir, the senior officer has arrived""

958
01:49:15,522 --> 01:49:22,951
AcP Ajay Singh is an example of
sincerity and honesty in the department

959
01:49:23,530 --> 01:49:27,523
When he gets to know that
his brother is a traitor...

960
01:49:28,035 --> 01:49:32,870
he will hang his head in shame.
He won"t be able to face anyone!

961
01:49:33,641 --> 01:49:38,203
You have spat in his face!
Right in his face!

962
01:49:42,549 --> 01:49:44,676
""Take care of your brother, sir""

963
01:49:47,254 --> 01:49:50,553
lt felt very bad to hit him...

964
01:49:51,225 --> 01:49:53,989
""but l"ve learnt it from you,
that whether the criminal...""

965
01:49:54,261 --> 01:49:58,891
""is your brother or father,
he must be treated like a criminal""

966
01:50:00,567 --> 01:50:04,094
He hasn"t told me anything.
But maybe he will tell you

967
01:50:16,517 --> 01:50:21,216
""l have done nothing that will deal
a blow to your status, brother""

968
01:50:21,722 --> 01:50:23,519
l"ve got to know everything

969
01:50:24,258 --> 01:50:27,523
But where was the need for you
to go and meet a stranger?

970
01:50:28,662 --> 01:50:31,222
You could"ve consulted me
if there was something important

971
01:50:32,199 --> 01:50:34,531
A stranger telephoned you
and you went to meet him?

972
01:50:34,768 --> 01:50:39,205
Ajay... what"s happening here?
Why have you tied him up?

973
01:50:39,940 --> 01:50:43,535
My son can"t be like that.
Your wife has told me everything

974
01:50:44,211 --> 01:50:49,911
""My son can"t be a traitor!
Let him go, my son. Release him""

975
01:50:50,184 --> 01:50:52,778
""l can"t release him, mother.
- Why not?""

976
01:50:53,020 --> 01:50:55,011
""He was caught in the possession
of illegal arms, mother!""

977
01:50:55,222 --> 01:50:57,213
All the evidence and witnesses
are loaded against him

978
01:50:57,558 --> 01:51:01,995
""You can see that the witnesses and
evidence are fabricated, brother""

979
01:51:02,262 --> 01:51:05,823
""To implicate Uday, this is a ploy
used by Balraj"s enemies""

980
01:51:06,100 --> 01:51:10,093
l know all that. But he has
already fallen into the trap

981
01:51:12,206 --> 01:51:16,836
""Let"s go, Mother.
Have faith in me. l"m here""

982
01:51:17,244 --> 01:51:20,645
""l"ll do my best to save him.
- No, my son, no!""

983
01:51:20,914 --> 01:51:23,075
""Let him go, then l"ll go home.
- come on, mother""

984
01:51:23,517 --> 01:51:26,748
""Believe me, l"ll do my best
to save him""

985
01:51:42,536 --> 01:51:45,198
""You must"ve gone through the
charge-sheet l"ve filed, sir""

986
01:51:46,540 --> 01:51:50,203
The interesting point in this case
is that AcP Ajay"s brother Uday...

987
01:51:50,677 --> 01:51:52,542
lives with him

988
01:51:53,547 --> 01:51:56,107
Munna Tiwari"s testimony has
amply proved...

989
01:51:56,550 --> 01:51:58,814
that he"s a terrorist.
- l see

990
01:51:59,086 --> 01:52:07,494
lt can"t be denied that Mr Ajay had
sheltered a traitor in his house

991
01:52:08,162 --> 01:52:12,496
""The law is the same for everyone,
for the common man and for the police""

992
01:52:13,700 --> 01:52:17,192
Begin legal proceedings
against AcP Rana too

993
01:52:17,704 --> 01:52:18,500
""Very well, sir""

994
01:52:18,705 --> 01:52:22,505
""For the present, arrest Balraj Rana
under TADA immediately""

995
01:52:23,510 --> 01:52:25,501
Here"s his arrest warrant

996
01:52:28,215 --> 01:52:31,514
l"m not sparing kaskar anymore!

997
01:52:31,785 --> 01:52:36,119
""When he wanted finance, he wagged
his tail before you""

998
01:52:36,590 --> 01:52:38,922
""Once that was over,
like a whore...""

999
01:52:39,193 --> 01:52:42,094
he gets thick with Vithalrao
and Shankar kalal

1000
01:52:42,529 --> 01:52:44,963
And he becomes the main witness
against your brother Uday

1001
01:52:45,232 --> 01:52:47,530
l"m not sparing him!

1002
01:52:49,736 --> 01:52:53,934
""Brother, l went to the police
station to meet Uday yesterday""

1003
01:52:54,541 --> 01:52:56,873
But Ajay wouldn"t let me meet him

1004
01:52:57,544 --> 01:53:00,206
And today"s newspapers say
TADA could be imposed on Uday

1005
01:53:01,248 --> 01:53:04,217
Nothing will happen to Uday
so long as l"m alive

1006
01:53:05,552 --> 01:53:09,716
""l know, Nazir kaskar has been
used as a pawn...""

1007
01:53:10,023 --> 01:53:14,483
by Vithalrao and Shankar kalal
in this conspiracy against me

1008
01:53:16,163 --> 01:53:21,066
""They don"t know, although they can
extinguish a lamp with a blow...""

1009
01:53:21,502 --> 01:53:25,905
they can"t put out
a storm of blazes

1010
01:53:28,208 --> 01:53:31,075
What"s happening here...?
Get going. Get lost

1011
01:53:39,520 --> 01:53:41,511
You are arrested under TADA

1012
01:53:44,258 --> 01:53:48,092
""Your brother lived in your house,
dealt in illegal arms...""

1013
01:53:48,529 --> 01:53:52,522
and you don"t even know about it?
How is that possible?

1014
01:53:52,833 --> 01:53:56,098
lf you are suspecting my honesty
over Uday"s arrest...

1015
01:53:56,537 --> 01:54:02,100
""there is nothing l can do, sir.
But l will say so much in my defence""

1016
01:54:02,543 --> 01:54:04,135
My brother is innocent

1017
01:54:04,545 --> 01:54:07,912
He has nothing to do with any
of Balraj Rana"s businesses

1018
01:54:08,215 --> 01:54:11,150
""l can believe what you"re saying,
but the law will not""

1019
01:54:11,585 --> 01:54:17,785
You know very well that it"s a crime
to shelter a terrorist in your house

1020
01:54:19,326 --> 01:54:21,726
There will be departmental
enquiry against you

1021
01:54:22,262 --> 01:54:24,253
""Till then, l have
to suspend you""

1022
01:54:46,286 --> 01:54:48,277
When did you return?

1023
01:54:49,590 --> 01:54:52,252
What is the matter...?
You look upset

1024
01:54:55,596 --> 01:54:58,588
Why"re you quiet?
Say something

1025
01:54:59,333 --> 01:55:01,858
""Whatever has happened
was inevitable, Sujata""

1026
01:55:02,302 --> 01:55:07,103
l knew it. Until Balraj Rana
has relations with this family...

1027
01:55:07,541 --> 01:55:11,705
the poison of his crimes would
one day bring ruin to us

1028
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:17,182
Which is why l always told mother
to ask him not to come to this house

1029
01:55:18,251 --> 01:55:20,845
But mother never took me seriously

1030
01:55:22,255 --> 01:55:27,158
""AcP Rana, who was an example in
sincerity and honesty...""

1031
01:55:27,561 --> 01:55:32,089
today stands suspended for
harbouring a traitor in his house!

1032
01:55:34,267 --> 01:55:36,963
What are you saying?
- lt"s the truth!

1033
01:55:37,237 --> 01:55:38,898
The whole truth!

1034
01:55:40,240 --> 01:55:45,735
Balraj Rana alone is responsible
for the destruction of this family!

1035
01:55:48,582 --> 01:55:53,884
You have committed no crime.
So why must you be worried?

1036
01:55:54,588 --> 01:55:56,249
""God willing, everything
will be all right""

1037
01:55:56,590 --> 01:56:00,117
""What will be all right?
Nothing will be all right, Sujata""

1038
01:56:01,128 --> 01:56:03,995
There will be an enquiry against me.
And if l fail...

1039
01:56:04,264 --> 01:56:06,926
""to prove my innocence,
l"ll lose my job!""

1040
01:56:07,200 --> 01:56:08,861
l may even have to go to jail!

1041
01:56:09,136 --> 01:56:12,663
No! My son will not go to jail!

1042
01:56:12,939 --> 01:56:14,839
""For God"s sake,
don"t say such things""

1043
01:56:15,142 --> 01:56:20,944
God is not so stone-hearted. You have
never harmed anyone in your lifetime

1044
01:56:21,248 --> 01:56:25,844
God can"t do this injustice to us...
- Don"t talk of God again and again!

1045
01:56:26,720 --> 01:56:29,553
l have no faith in God anymore!

1046
01:56:30,557 --> 01:56:33,151
Because if there was a power
like God somewhere...

1047
01:56:33,560 --> 01:56:36,120
Uday wouldn"t have been
behind the bars

1048
01:56:36,563 --> 01:56:38,724
l wouldn"t have been accused of
treason against the country!

1049
01:56:41,802 --> 01:56:43,133
Treason...?

1050
01:56:43,570 --> 01:56:45,731
There is no such thing as God

1051
01:56:46,573 --> 01:56:49,303
Or Uday and l wouldn"t have been
punished for Balraj Rana"s sins!

1052
01:56:50,610 --> 01:56:51,702
What happened?

1053
01:56:52,279 --> 01:56:54,144
What happened to mother?

1054
01:56:54,581 --> 01:56:56,139
Mother...?

1055
01:56:56,583 --> 01:56:58,175
""Get some water, quick!""

1056
01:56:59,252 --> 01:57:01,015
""What happened, mother?""

1057
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:17,832
Mother...
- Don"t touch me! Go away

1058
01:57:20,340 --> 01:57:25,539
lt"s because of your sins that
Uday is today in police custody

1059
01:57:26,747 --> 01:57:28,942
""Don"t say such things, Mother""

1060
01:57:29,216 --> 01:57:31,980
You have snatched the joy
of your family

1061
01:57:32,252 --> 01:57:34,584
So why have you come here?
Go away!

1062
01:57:34,855 --> 01:57:38,882
""Go away, l say!
l hate the sight of you!""

1063
01:57:39,259 --> 01:57:42,558
""But l"m your son, mother.
l"m your flesh and blood""

1064
01:57:43,597 --> 01:57:47,124
And nothing will happen to Uday.
l will have him released

1065
01:57:47,567 --> 01:57:52,266
l will prove his innocence.
- How will you prove his innocence?

1066
01:57:52,706 --> 01:57:55,698
You are yourself caught in
the vortex of crime!

1067
01:57:56,176 --> 01:57:58,576
Ajay has lost his job
because of you

1068
01:58:02,249 --> 01:58:05,707
He has been accused of
treason against the country

1069
01:58:06,520 --> 01:58:10,854
And you... you even killed
your father!

1070
01:58:11,124 --> 01:58:13,115
Everything has happened
only because of you!

1071
01:58:13,527 --> 01:58:17,861
Our family has gone to seed.
Go away!

1072
01:58:22,536 --> 01:58:24,163
""No, mother...""

1073
01:58:32,846 --> 01:58:35,144
""Mister, please light
her funeral pyre""

1074
01:59:19,593 --> 01:59:21,857
You even killed
your father!

1075
01:59:22,128 --> 01:59:24,119
Everything has happened
only because of you!

1076
01:59:24,531 --> 01:59:29,833
Our family has gone to seed.
Go away!

1077
01:59:47,554 --> 01:59:48,145
""Hold it, swine!""

1078
01:59:48,555 --> 01:59:51,046
""Wait there, brother...
don"t run!""

1079
02:00:01,268 --> 02:00:03,964
""Brother, run away!
Escape!""

1080
02:00:05,505 --> 02:00:08,303
""Don"t run, brother!
come back here!""

1081
02:00:08,742 --> 02:00:09,834
Escape!

1082
02:00:21,521 --> 02:00:23,113
""Wait here, you swine!""

1083
02:00:31,231 --> 02:00:35,531
Munna Tiwari here. Mr kaskar is away
at the sight. Please call later...

1084
02:00:39,205 --> 02:00:41,196
God! Where will l hide?

1085
02:00:42,142 --> 02:00:43,939
Don"t let him get away!

1086
02:00:44,311 --> 02:00:45,835
Where"s he...?

1087
02:01:11,237 --> 02:01:12,499
Ten rupees

1088
02:01:14,207 --> 02:01:16,505
Don"t let him get away!

1089
02:01:18,211 --> 02:01:20,771
Take the car back!
- But there"s a car behind us

1090
02:01:43,670 --> 02:01:46,138
""Balraj, l"ve made no mistake!""

1091
02:01:46,706 --> 02:01:50,107
They threatened me
and got me to do it!

1092
02:01:50,543 --> 02:01:53,979
lt"s not my fault...
please forgive me!

1093
02:01:54,247 --> 02:01:56,044
Please forgive me!

1094
02:01:56,549 --> 02:02:00,781
""Nazir kaskar, you want me
to forgive you?""

1095
02:02:01,688 --> 02:02:05,488
""Because of you, TADA has been
imposed on my kid brother""

1096
02:02:06,493 --> 02:02:10,020
Balraj Rana never changes
his decisions

1097
02:02:20,073 --> 02:02:22,837
What? Nazir kaskar"s
role has come to an end?

1098
02:02:23,109 --> 02:02:25,907
""Yes, sir. Balraj Rana
has bumped him off""

1099
02:02:26,179 --> 02:02:29,945
""Looks like it"s your turn now.
- What rubbish, kadam!""

1100
02:02:30,216 --> 02:02:34,084
You think l"m scared of Balraj Rana?
lf he messes with me...

1101
02:02:34,521 --> 02:02:39,083
l"ll finish his role! Now go and
get me the file on the Madanlal case

1102
02:02:48,535 --> 02:02:51,095
What are you doing...?
Forget about food

1103
02:02:51,538 --> 02:02:55,941
""Get the kids, pack your bags.
We"ve got to quit town immediately""

1104
02:02:56,276 --> 02:02:57,971
l"m coming over

1105
02:03:00,880 --> 02:03:03,849
Rukmini... where are
all of you?

1106
02:03:04,117 --> 02:03:06,483
ls everyone ready?
Bring me my clothes quickly

1107
02:03:06,753 --> 02:03:08,152
Where are you?

1108
02:03:14,861 --> 02:03:17,056
You? At my place?

1109
02:03:17,497 --> 02:03:20,489
The lord of death never
announces his arrival

1110
02:03:21,234 --> 02:03:23,862
You hit me...?
Bloody thug!

1111
02:03:24,170 --> 02:03:27,503
You call me a thug?
And you"re a gentleman?

1112
02:03:49,829 --> 02:03:51,091
Move it... !

1113
02:03:51,831 --> 02:03:56,029
Balraj... forgive me.
Please forgive me

1114
02:04:00,807 --> 02:04:02,934
""Balraj Rana, please forgive me""

1115
02:04:03,209 --> 02:04:06,235
l was misled by Vithalrao
and Shankar kalal

1116
02:04:06,713 --> 02:04:09,181
l"ve made a very big mistake.
Please forgive me

1117
02:04:09,616 --> 02:04:12,949
You"re a pimp who has
sold his uniform

1118
02:04:13,653 --> 02:04:15,814
You want to be spared?

1119
02:04:17,157 --> 02:04:20,149
So go to the police station
and confess to your crimes

1120
02:04:20,593 --> 02:04:26,225
Balraj! l"m willing to do anything!
Anything! But please forgive me

1121
02:04:26,666 --> 02:04:29,134
l"ll go the commissioner right now and
confess to my misdeeds

1122
02:04:29,569 --> 02:04:30,900
But please forgive me

1123
02:04:31,171 --> 02:04:34,231
""Please don"t kill him.
Spare him, please""

1124
02:04:40,747 --> 02:04:45,150
Till such time as his confession
washes away the stigma...

1125
02:04:45,585 --> 02:04:47,576
attached to my brothers" names...

1126
02:04:49,589 --> 02:04:52,581
his wife and kids will remain
in our custody

1127
02:04:52,892 --> 02:04:53,916
All right

1128
02:05:01,701 --> 02:05:04,932
""Babu, take them along.
- Move it!""

1129
02:05:06,539 --> 02:05:10,532
Why"re you crying? You know
how corrupt your husband is?

1130
02:05:10,810 --> 02:05:13,210
You didn"t cry when
he brought the moolah

1131
02:05:20,820 --> 02:05:23,118
l"m glad you have been reinstated

1132
02:05:23,556 --> 02:05:26,116
The stigma attached
to your name...

1133
02:05:26,559 --> 02:05:29,551
has been washed away by
lnspector Dandekar"s testimony

1134
02:05:30,230 --> 02:05:32,221
He has confessed to
all his crimes

1135
02:05:33,566 --> 02:05:38,094
""Here you are. Warrants for Vithalrao,
Shankar kalal and all their men""

1136
02:05:39,906 --> 02:05:42,272
Arrest them all as soon as possible

1137
02:06:02,395 --> 02:06:05,125
""l have confessed to my crime, sir""

1138
02:06:06,132 --> 02:06:09,863
Even the law says that once the
criminal has confessed...

1139
02:06:10,136 --> 02:06:12,866
you shouldn"t beat him up.
- Set him free

1140
02:06:21,214 --> 02:06:24,706
This is just what l expected from
a sincere police officer like you

1141
02:06:26,986 --> 02:06:31,082
A man condemned to death must
expect no mercy from the hangman

1142
02:06:32,558 --> 02:06:34,549
""Please don"t hit me, sir...""

1143
02:06:36,562 --> 02:06:40,089
""l"m a heart patient, sir!
- Heart patient, eh?""

1144
02:06:40,566 --> 02:06:43,228
""lf l die, you"ll land
in trouble, sir""

1145
02:06:49,309 --> 02:06:53,109
Vithalrao and Shankar Dalal
have gone underground

1146
02:06:53,579 --> 02:06:55,570
You know where they are

1147
02:06:56,049 --> 02:06:58,108
""Tell me, or else...
- l"ll tell you!""

1148
02:06:59,252 --> 02:07:02,585
""Sir, this is the ticket
for your morning flight""

1149
02:07:03,256 --> 02:07:08,125
""But why"re you going to Delhi suddenly?
- Not going, l"ve already gone away""

1150
02:07:09,128 --> 02:07:10,925
lf Shankar kalal calls...

1151
02:07:11,197 --> 02:07:13,188
tell him that l have a meeting
with the Prime Minister

1152
02:07:13,533 --> 02:07:15,524
So l have gone away
to Delhi urgently

1153
02:07:15,835 --> 02:07:17,826
""l get it all, sir""

1154
02:07:21,541 --> 02:07:23,202
This is Gajanan Dubey speaking

1155
02:07:23,609 --> 02:07:26,237
Shankar kalal speaking.
Give the phone to the cM

1156
02:07:28,214 --> 02:07:30,546
The cM is not here.
He has run away

1157
02:07:31,250 --> 02:07:34,219
Run away? What rubbish
are you talking?

1158
02:07:34,721 --> 02:07:40,557
""Actually, sir, the PM had called.
So the cM has gone away to Delhi""

1159
02:07:41,227 --> 02:07:43,855
Murli Manohar has disappeared.
And this chap has run away too!

1160
02:07:44,130 --> 02:07:45,927
Both have proved to be rascals

1161
02:07:46,232 --> 02:07:48,860
""Now that we need their help,
they"ve ditched us!""

1162
02:07:49,135 --> 02:07:53,936
Bhausaheb has gone away to Delhi and
Murli Manohar has gone God knows where

1163
02:07:54,240 --> 02:07:57,232
The underworld is like
a game of chess

1164
02:07:57,977 --> 02:08:02,277
One wrong move and the whole game
is turned on its head

1165
02:08:02,615 --> 02:08:05,914
These politicians are not
going to be of any help

1166
02:08:07,253 --> 02:08:09,915
We"ll have to play
a new game on our own

1167
02:08:10,189 --> 02:08:12,521
""l"ve already thought
of a game, Vithalrao""

1168
02:08:13,526 --> 02:08:16,518
Before he can get
to the court tomorrow...

1169
02:08:17,196 --> 02:08:19,687
Pratap will bump off Dandekar

1170
02:08:20,533 --> 02:08:22,933
""Go and look, guys!
c"mon!""

1171
02:09:32,572 --> 02:09:34,665
c"mon! Move it!

1172
02:10:22,221 --> 02:10:23,210
c"mon!

1173
02:11:07,199 --> 02:11:10,066
What happened?
- lt was a gunshot

1174
02:11:10,503 --> 02:11:11,492
What?

1175
02:11:15,508 --> 02:11:17,066
lt"s an accident

1176
02:11:17,510 --> 02:11:19,501
""Turn the jeep around.
- Yes, sir""

1177
02:11:48,541 --> 02:11:49,940
""Let me go, Uday!""

1178
02:11:50,209 --> 02:11:53,770
""lf l die, you"ll never be able
to get out of the TADA charges!""

1179
02:11:54,046 --> 02:11:55,536
Let me go!

1180
02:12:08,728 --> 02:12:10,719
""Gautam, you know l"m innocent!""

1181
02:13:01,247 --> 02:13:02,236
Stop there!

1182
02:13:13,693 --> 02:13:16,856
""Pratap, you"re a friend of mine!
Why"re you killing me?""

1183
02:13:17,163 --> 02:13:21,190
""Friend, my foot!
l"ll finish your role today""

1184
02:13:48,194 --> 02:13:53,097
""Your Honour, l request the court
to grant me some more time""

1185
02:13:53,532 --> 02:13:56,968
""Your Honour, by asking for
more time again and again...""

1186
02:13:57,236 --> 02:14:00,069
AcP Rana is wasting the
precious time of the court

1187
02:14:00,539 --> 02:14:03,235
""For the last two hours,
at his request...""

1188
02:14:03,709 --> 02:14:08,203
""we"ve been waiting for the state
witness, lnspector Dandekar""

1189
02:14:09,548 --> 02:14:13,882
But AcP Rana has still not been able
to produce his witness

1190
02:14:15,221 --> 02:14:17,212
""lt deserves attention,
My Lord...""

1191
02:14:17,723 --> 02:14:22,558
that this case is being pursued
against my clients Shankar kalal...

1192
02:14:23,162 --> 02:14:30,568
Vithalrao and Natwar Banarasi on
the testimony of a mere lnspector

1193
02:14:31,971 --> 02:14:36,237
""ln this case, there is neither any
evidence nor any other witness""

1194
02:14:36,776 --> 02:14:42,112
l therefore request the court
to dismiss this case

1195
02:14:45,584 --> 02:14:46,710
Mr Judge...

1196
02:14:48,354 --> 02:14:51,585
""please wait, Mr Judge.
Here is the state witness""

1197
02:14:57,296 --> 02:15:01,289
Speak the whole truth. Or you will
never see your family again

1198
02:15:12,711 --> 02:15:17,648
""Before l issue my testimony, l seek
permission to say something in court""

1199
02:15:17,950 --> 02:15:18,974
Permission granted

1200
02:15:19,251 --> 02:15:23,950
l request the court for a
bullet-proof jacket and a helmet

1201
02:15:24,557 --> 02:15:29,119
A bullet might probably lodge itself
in my skull while l"m speaking...

1202
02:15:29,562 --> 02:15:32,554
and my role in the witness box
could come to an end

1203
02:15:36,569 --> 02:15:40,266
""Mr Dandekar, do not be afraid.
This is a courtroom""

1204
02:15:40,706 --> 02:15:45,040
Nothing of the sort will happen here.
You can speak without fear

1205
02:16:23,649 --> 02:16:27,915
The confession of the state witness
lnspector Dandekar has proved...

1206
02:16:28,220 --> 02:16:30,984
that Vithalrao and
Shankar kalal...

1207
02:16:31,257 --> 02:16:34,226
in collusion with lnspector Dandekar
and Nazir kaskar...

1208
02:16:34,693 --> 02:16:37,127
hatched a conspiracy
against Balraj Rana

1209
02:16:37,563 --> 02:16:42,330
""As a result, Balraj Singh Rana and Uday
Singh Rana were arrested under TADA""

1210
02:16:42,768 --> 02:16:48,138
ln view of the testimonies and
the evidence produced in court...

1211
02:16:48,574 --> 02:16:56,572
this court acquits the accused Balraj
Singh Rana and Uday Singh Rana

1212
02:17:04,223 --> 02:17:08,091
l also issue an order to arrest
Balraj Singh Rana...

1213
02:17:08,527 --> 02:17:13,157
to file a case against him for
escaping from police custody

1214
02:17:15,200 --> 02:17:19,102
""Because Vithalrao, Shankar kalal,
lnspector Dandekar...""

1215
02:17:19,538 --> 02:17:24,908
and Natwar Banarasi stand accused of
several murders and crimes...

1216
02:17:25,210 --> 02:17:29,840
the court orders them to police
remand for 15 days...

1217
02:17:30,115 --> 02:17:33,551
at AcP Rana"s request

1218
02:17:42,561 --> 02:17:44,051
Take them all away

1219
02:17:51,270 --> 02:17:53,101
Take him away

1220
02:18:38,617 --> 02:18:42,553
""Hold it, brother!
Don"t take the law in your hands!""

1221
02:18:44,223 --> 02:18:45,884
""Stop there, or l"ll shoot""

1222
02:18:54,767 --> 02:18:55,756
Stop them!

1223
02:19:07,679 --> 02:19:09,840
Dandekar...!

1224
02:19:13,252 --> 02:19:14,844
""Let me go, Uday!""

1225
02:19:27,833 --> 02:19:29,858
""Leave me alone, l say!""

1226
02:19:32,538 --> 02:19:35,530
""He"s taking the law in his hands!
Stop there, brother...""

1227
02:19:39,044 --> 02:19:40,534
""Stop there, l say!""

1228
02:19:48,654 --> 02:19:49,712
Hold it!

1229
02:19:52,691 --> 02:19:53,953
""Wait, brother!""

1230
02:20:04,570 --> 02:20:05,901
Brother!

1231
02:20:12,511 --> 02:20:15,947
""Nothing"s happening to you, brother!""

1232
02:20:16,215 --> 02:20:16,840
Brother!

1233
02:20:17,116 --> 02:20:20,813
l"ll take you to the hospital!
Nothing will happen to you

1234
02:20:21,253 --> 02:20:24,780
Get a hold on yourself...
you"ll be all right

1235
02:20:25,524 --> 02:20:30,188
Nothing will happen to you.
Nothing!

1236
02:20:35,267 --> 02:20:36,256
Brother!
