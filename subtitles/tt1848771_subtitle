1
00:03:32,192 --> 00:03:33,659
Deepak... kumar.

2
00:03:34,594 --> 00:03:35,891
What is your full name?

3
00:03:36,463 --> 00:03:38,226
Deepak kumar. That's it.

4
00:03:39,432 --> 00:03:43,960
Family background?
Tell us about your father.

5
00:03:45,205 --> 00:03:48,402
I never met my father, sir.
My mother raised me.

6
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,906
I see. What does she do?

7
00:03:52,913 --> 00:03:54,312
She used to work as
a domestic maid, sir.

8
00:03:55,181 --> 00:03:56,978
Now she irons neighbours' clothes.

9
00:03:58,118 --> 00:04:00,143
You seem to have scored
58% in 10th grade and 61% in the 12th.

10
00:04:00,186 --> 00:04:04,088
But, afterjoining s.t.m.,
i topped the b. Sc. Stream with 76%.

11
00:04:04,457 --> 00:04:07,517
And in m. Sc., i stood first
in the university's merit list.

12
00:04:08,461 --> 00:04:12,261
Well... we can see that.
But, mr. Deepak... kumar,

13
00:04:12,933 --> 00:04:15,925
ours will be the most expensive institute
in central india.

14
00:04:16,202 --> 00:04:22,004
Children of politicians, businessmen,
bureaucrats and other vips will study here.

15
00:04:22,943 --> 00:04:25,138
Our aim isn't merely
to provide top class education...

16
00:04:25,312 --> 00:04:27,380
but also ensure their overall development.

17
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,180
Manners, etiquette,
communication skills, body language...

18
00:04:31,384 --> 00:04:35,388
y'know, almost like a... finishing school.

19
00:04:35,388 --> 00:04:37,720
You do know what
a finishing school is, don't you?

20
00:04:38,158 --> 00:04:40,490
No. In fact, this is
the first time i've heard of it.

21
00:04:40,694 --> 00:04:42,162
I can understand.

22
00:04:42,162 --> 00:04:43,730
After all,
given your mother's background...

23
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,493
sir, please!

24
00:04:46,766 --> 00:04:49,758
You aren't even capable of
understanding my mother's background.

25
00:04:51,738 --> 00:04:55,108
And, as for manners and etiquette?

26
00:04:55,108 --> 00:04:58,305
You can't find a better example
of that than me.

27
00:04:58,411 --> 00:05:00,641
You've been repeatedly mocking
my caste and status...

28
00:05:02,782 --> 00:05:05,751
and yet, this paperweight
continues to remain here.

29
00:05:07,187 --> 00:05:08,211
If it weren't for manners...

30
00:05:09,122 --> 00:05:11,682
i'd have branded your
institute's name on your foreheads.

31
00:05:13,793 --> 00:05:14,760
Thank you, gentlemen.

32
00:05:21,701 --> 00:05:26,434
Had you asked me a single question
about my subject, you would've realised that...

33
00:05:26,806 --> 00:05:30,139
a person's intelligence and performance
do not depend on his background.

34
00:05:31,077 --> 00:05:32,479
You have obviously forgotten that,
given the opportunity...

35
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,472
it was a backward caste person
who drafted our country's constitution.

36
00:05:46,626 --> 00:05:50,084
It's precisely this despicable mentality
that is ruining our country.

37
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:54,257
I can't believe that they studied
in this very college.

38
00:05:55,235 --> 00:05:56,463
And this is their mindset!

39
00:05:58,038 --> 00:05:59,471
I have obviously failed as their teacher.

40
00:05:59,806 --> 00:06:00,704
Sir... it's okay.

41
00:06:02,275 --> 00:06:03,799
No! It's not okay!

42
00:06:04,577 --> 00:06:08,570
I'm sorry that by sending you there
i caused you to suffer humiliation.

43
00:06:09,215 --> 00:06:14,517
I thought that until your doctorate begins,
you could gain some experience.

44
00:06:16,056 --> 00:06:19,355
And, it would also
reduce your mother's burden.

45
00:06:21,227 --> 00:06:22,592
How's her backache now?

46
00:06:23,496 --> 00:06:24,520
She's much better, sir.

47
00:06:25,465 --> 00:06:26,762
Do look after her well.

48
00:06:27,067 --> 00:06:30,336
Have you mailed your
papers to cornell university?

49
00:06:30,336 --> 00:06:33,601
Sir, actually i'd like to
do my doctorate under you.

50
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,431
Absolutely not!

51
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:38,401
Whatever you needed to learn from me, you have.
Time you moved ahead.

52
00:06:39,813 --> 00:06:40,541
Yes, sir.

53
00:06:45,852 --> 00:06:50,757
But until you leave for the us, why can't
the principal give you a job at his college?

54
00:06:50,757 --> 00:06:53,157
Mother... sir has already
helped me so much.

55
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,528
Now, if he also hires me,
won't people accuse him of favouritism?

56
00:06:57,797 --> 00:07:00,425
You're back early, hariya?

57
00:07:00,533 --> 00:07:03,670
Must've sneaked out
of the evening class. Isn't it?

58
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,705
The teacher himself didn't show up.

59
00:07:05,705 --> 00:07:08,241
Don't tell me his goat was stolen again.

60
00:07:08,241 --> 00:07:09,509
No, not the goat.

61
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:11,711
This time they say his wife ran away
in sheer frustration.

62
00:07:11,711 --> 00:07:12,575
Shut up, silly boy!

63
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:15,415
Won't you play the computer game today?

64
00:07:15,415 --> 00:07:17,484
No, got to work on important stuff.
Don't disturb me.

65
00:07:17,484 --> 00:07:19,884
Why, haven't you finished
your homework yet?

66
00:07:20,587 --> 00:07:22,555
No, i have to
submit this today. Go now!

67
00:07:22,555 --> 00:07:24,691
Deepu... admit it.

68
00:07:24,691 --> 00:07:26,682
You're scared of losing.

69
00:07:29,295 --> 00:07:31,698
- So, suppose a plus b plus...

70
00:07:31,698 --> 00:07:35,259
panditji, there you go again
taking the longer route!

71
00:07:35,568 --> 00:07:38,204
Obviously! After all, he is from
the intellectual caste of our society.

72
00:07:38,204 --> 00:07:42,197
How will he prove that
unless he exhibits his extra intelligence?

73
00:07:42,408 --> 00:07:44,308
But sir, my answer is
the same as that!

74
00:07:45,145 --> 00:07:47,739
Sure. But, why did you need
these extra four steps?

75
00:07:48,681 --> 00:07:50,717
Sir, but i've memorized every answer.

76
00:07:50,717 --> 00:07:53,208
Now, if i try the shorter route,
i could lose direction.

77
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:57,586
Ok.

78
00:07:57,657 --> 00:07:59,488
Congratulations, principal sir.

79
00:07:59,793 --> 00:08:03,160
Both ganesh and raghav
have been accepted into llt kanpur.

80
00:08:04,297 --> 00:08:05,594
Wow!

81
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:08,868
Well done, well done!

82
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,237
However...

83
00:08:13,173 --> 00:08:15,266
your real struggle begins now.

84
00:08:16,242 --> 00:08:18,176
Have some sweets, shambhu kaka.

85
00:08:19,245 --> 00:08:20,610
To celebrate whose success?

86
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,848
Their success.

87
00:08:21,848 --> 00:08:23,509
They've got into the engineering stream.

88
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:24,751
Wow!

89
00:08:24,751 --> 00:08:28,312
Whoever studies here
is bound to succeed anywhere.

90
00:08:28,421 --> 00:08:29,888
So, shall we enroll you too?

91
00:08:31,257 --> 00:08:33,191
Come on, what'll i do here?

92
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,429
But, you know my daughter muniya...
she is in the tenth grade.

93
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:37,760
As soon as she clears that...

94
00:08:38,731 --> 00:08:40,665
i'll plonk her in front of guruji.

95
00:08:40,834 --> 00:08:42,768
She will work hard, you'll see...

96
00:08:42,869 --> 00:08:46,464
mark my words, she will become...
how d'you say it... a collector!

97
00:08:46,873 --> 00:08:48,942
Dad, you aren't allowed.

98
00:08:48,942 --> 00:08:50,543
Surely, just one...

99
00:08:50,543 --> 00:08:53,413
ever since the results were declared last week,
you've been gorging on sweets.

100
00:08:53,413 --> 00:08:54,209
Now no more.

101
00:08:54,814 --> 00:08:57,647
You're becoming exactly
like your mother, you know that?

102
00:08:58,685 --> 00:08:59,845
You said something?

103
00:09:04,724 --> 00:09:05,358
Last one!

104
00:09:05,358 --> 00:09:13,356
Suppose, a+b+c+d by 2 is greater
than or equal to under root a+b...

105
00:09:15,368 --> 00:09:15,768
+c+d

106
00:09:15,768 --> 00:09:17,237
did you send your papers to cornell?

107
00:09:17,237 --> 00:09:19,330
Yes. But i won't be going.

108
00:09:19,439 --> 00:09:21,808
You will have to, junior professor.

109
00:09:21,808 --> 00:09:24,675
Because, you see,
i am going to follow you there.

110
00:09:24,911 --> 00:09:27,505
Quit dreaming. I'm not going.

111
00:09:28,514 --> 00:09:30,573
Alright, don't go to cornell.

112
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,613
But, surely you can come for a movie.

113
00:09:35,722 --> 00:09:36,956
What?

114
00:09:36,956 --> 00:09:39,254
You're gawking like
i tried to molest you.

115
00:09:54,874 --> 00:09:58,970
When you ruffle your wet hair
and shower droplets all around

116
00:10:00,947 --> 00:10:02,437
it feels so good

117
00:10:03,883 --> 00:10:08,479
when you part your lips
and softly whisper sweet nothings

118
00:10:09,956 --> 00:10:11,685
it feels so good

119
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,891
don't float around like a fragrance,
just get to the point.

120
00:10:18,298 --> 00:10:19,959
Look into my eyes and say it

121
00:10:20,533 --> 00:10:22,023
don't make me wander in dreams

122
00:10:22,402 --> 00:10:25,303
in short, just say it

123
00:10:26,572 --> 00:10:29,097
just get to the point

124
00:10:30,977 --> 00:10:33,673
just get to the point

125
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,692
it's another feeling

126
00:10:58,137 --> 00:10:59,866
when you are around

127
00:11:12,085 --> 00:11:17,790
when you turn around
and smile in your endearing style

128
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,849
it feels so good

129
00:11:21,494 --> 00:11:24,952
don't play around with words,
don't fool me with your act

130
00:11:25,965 --> 00:11:29,696
take my hand in yours,
come out with those three little words

131
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:33,168
in short, just say it

132
00:11:34,807 --> 00:11:36,536
just get to the point

133
00:11:38,878 --> 00:11:41,540
just get to the point

134
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:44,177
say something...

135
00:11:46,052 --> 00:11:47,952
the weather is great...

136
00:11:50,957 --> 00:11:52,686
the lake is beautiful...

137
00:11:54,627 --> 00:11:55,389
and so are you...

138
00:11:58,064 --> 00:11:59,998
can't you just get to the point?

139
00:12:27,727 --> 00:12:32,426
It's not as bad as it seems.

140
00:12:36,736 --> 00:12:37,964
You're looking fit.

141
00:12:38,805 --> 00:12:41,137
How about a game of badminton?

142
00:12:41,908 --> 00:12:44,502
You've obviously forgotten...

143
00:12:45,044 --> 00:12:49,674
that i beat you 21-15 the last time.

144
00:12:50,883 --> 00:12:56,048
I suggest you practice
some more before challenging me.

145
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:08,830
The moment you come
everything seems fine.

146
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:13,633
I am worried about them.

147
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,935
Nothing seems to have worked out.

148
00:13:17,477 --> 00:13:21,038
They want to start computer classes...

149
00:13:21,881 --> 00:13:25,681
but the bank isn't sanctioning their loan.

150
00:13:26,819 --> 00:13:29,481
They need a guarantor.

151
00:13:30,123 --> 00:13:31,784
The house hasn't been built completely.

152
00:13:31,824 --> 00:13:33,724
Listen...

153
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:37,957
if the bank agrees...

154
00:13:37,997 --> 00:13:39,487
i'll sign as a guarantor.

155
00:13:40,299 --> 00:13:44,504
As for the house,
right now they're staying in our new house.

156
00:13:44,504 --> 00:13:48,964
But for how long
can we pile on to you?

157
00:13:50,776 --> 00:13:54,644
They were supposed to be there
just for two months... it's already four!

158
00:13:55,314 --> 00:14:00,251
Papa, the builder said we'll
get possession in three-four months.

159
00:14:00,286 --> 00:14:03,221
That's perfect.
I don't need the house immediately.

160
00:14:03,923 --> 00:14:06,858
The college is giving me
a two-year extension.

161
00:14:06,893 --> 00:14:09,225
I don't want you to worry.

162
00:14:11,297 --> 00:14:14,232
You're the only one i have.

163
00:14:18,237 --> 00:14:21,900
But, i can't play badminton today.

164
00:14:24,177 --> 00:14:26,668
Tomorrow, definitely tomorrow.

165
00:14:37,924 --> 00:14:39,789
I'll be here.

166
00:14:44,797 --> 00:14:47,561
- I'll only be a minute.
- Make it quick.

167
00:14:50,469 --> 00:14:51,595
Guruji?

168
00:14:56,475 --> 00:14:58,602
Guruji, guruji...

169
00:14:58,644 --> 00:15:00,544
greetings to you.

170
00:15:00,613 --> 00:15:02,672
You can't leave unless
you have some tea.

171
00:15:03,249 --> 00:15:05,284
Shambhu, some other day.
I'm in a rush today.

172
00:15:05,284 --> 00:15:07,420
It'll only take a minute.

173
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:11,186
Listen... make some tea.

174
00:15:22,235 --> 00:15:26,399
She works very hard.
And, all on her own.

175
00:15:28,841 --> 00:15:31,143
- Greetings guruji.
- Bless you.

176
00:15:31,143 --> 00:15:32,337
What's going on here?

177
00:15:32,378 --> 00:15:33,709
- Greetings guruji.
- Bless you.

178
00:15:35,481 --> 00:15:39,315
Oh my god!
What is this high-sounding formula?

179
00:15:39,685 --> 00:15:41,710
- What is this?
- It's bernoulli's equation.

180
00:15:41,821 --> 00:15:43,880
I know, but what exactly does
bernoulli's equation mean?

181
00:15:44,156 --> 00:15:47,387
- Make sure you keep the house clean.
- Yes.

182
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,655
- You do light a lamp at the altar, right?
- Yes, everyday.

183
00:15:53,566 --> 00:15:54,328
- Namaste.
- Namaste.

184
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,459
- Take care.
- Ok.

185
00:15:56,702 --> 00:15:58,294
- So, what did we learn?

186
00:15:58,571 --> 00:16:02,837
- When air passes between
two strips of paper at high speed...

187
00:16:03,276 --> 00:16:04,334
like this...

188
00:16:06,345 --> 00:16:11,112
the pressure between them
decreases and...

189
00:16:12,385 --> 00:16:14,216
they fall in love.

190
00:16:15,588 --> 00:16:18,658
That means, even aeroplanes fly
using bernoulli's principle.

191
00:16:18,658 --> 00:16:20,182
Absolutely... q.e.d.

192
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,251
Oh yes, q.e. D
is quod erat demonstrandum.

193
00:16:23,296 --> 00:16:25,498
Oh no, no,
q.e.d. Means...

194
00:16:25,498 --> 00:16:26,430
quite easily done!

195
00:16:26,732 --> 00:16:28,199
Well, that was quite easily done.

196
00:16:28,367 --> 00:16:29,459
Absolutely!

197
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:40,270
I'm sanjay, sir.
Commerce, 2002 batch.

198
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,510
Sanjay...

199
00:16:42,348 --> 00:16:43,144
sanjay tandon!

200
00:16:43,549 --> 00:16:44,750
Banking services.

201
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,479
I'm a senior manager here,
come in, please.

202
00:16:47,653 --> 00:16:48,381
Please sit.

203
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:54,926
Indradev, please call for
some tea and get their papers.

204
00:16:56,162 --> 00:16:56,628
The papers?

205
00:16:56,696 --> 00:16:58,288
Sir, i am so happy you've come here.

206
00:17:04,337 --> 00:17:06,539
Sir, even i tried to get into s.t.m.

207
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:08,564
I wanted to become a scientist.

208
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,310
But i didn't score enough
at the state level exams.

209
00:17:12,345 --> 00:17:15,181
I worked hard in college
and scored well in the b. Com. Exams.

210
00:17:15,181 --> 00:17:17,183
And i got a job here,
in the reserved category.

211
00:17:17,183 --> 00:17:18,548
I see.

212
00:17:19,452 --> 00:17:21,620
It's only through hard work
that we win respect.

213
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,484
Yes, sir.

214
00:17:22,521 --> 00:17:24,785
It was my good fortune
that i got to meet you today.

215
00:17:25,324 --> 00:17:27,460
It was a pleasure
meeting you too, indradev.

216
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,462
Ram, sir. Indradev ram.

217
00:17:29,462 --> 00:17:30,360
Thank you, sir.

218
00:17:30,396 --> 00:17:31,761
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

219
00:17:31,964 --> 00:17:34,262
If there is any problem,
let me know.

220
00:17:34,734 --> 00:17:36,497
Now work sincerely.

221
00:17:37,403 --> 00:17:39,928
I want to see my friend happy.

222
00:17:40,206 --> 00:17:41,195
Yes, uncle.

223
00:17:46,645 --> 00:17:48,476
Sushant, can't you wait?

224
00:17:48,781 --> 00:17:49,679
But, i'm starving!

225
00:17:49,715 --> 00:17:51,350
Wait for deepak to come.

226
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,214
He'll eat when he gets here.

227
00:17:52,918 --> 00:17:53,942
Why should i starve to death?

228
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,220
The parathas will go cold
if you open the container.

229
00:17:56,522 --> 00:17:57,887
Oh i see...

230
00:17:58,591 --> 00:18:00,718
such glorious love!

231
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:03,328
Now that he is going to the us...

232
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:06,293
for whom will you bring hot parathas?

233
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,933
That leaves only...

234
00:18:09,735 --> 00:18:10,895
me!

235
00:18:12,471 --> 00:18:14,840
Then the parathas are mine and so are...

236
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,375
you wish!
Take a look in the mirror!

237
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,639
Why?
Is it worse than deepak's?

238
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:30,913
Deepak kumar, i'm extremely pleased
to appoint you as a junior lecturer at s.t.m.

239
00:18:30,956 --> 00:18:32,253
Congratulations.

240
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:34,821
Thank you, sir.

241
00:18:37,763 --> 00:18:38,821
I'm proud of you.

242
00:18:50,272 --> 00:18:51,500
- Come on.

243
00:18:51,606 --> 00:18:52,903
- This is where deepak lives?

244
00:18:53,075 --> 00:18:55,210
Why didn't you tell me
you live in such a narrow lane?

245
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:56,700
I could barely get my car in!

246
00:18:56,778 --> 00:18:59,581
But i had built a special helipad
for you on the roof.

247
00:18:59,581 --> 00:19:02,284
Little did i know
that you'd come by road.

248
00:19:02,284 --> 00:19:06,744
I would've happily come but
your poorbi is scared of flying with me.

249
00:19:06,922 --> 00:19:08,822
Sushant! You can't even walk properly...

250
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:09,687
and you're talking of flying.

251
00:19:10,258 --> 00:19:10,917
Oh yeah?

252
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:12,127
Make it fast, ok?

253
00:19:12,127 --> 00:19:13,526
- Shanti...

254
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:15,831
how are you?

255
00:19:15,831 --> 00:19:16,763
I'm good.

256
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:19,266
When it comes to a party,
you conveniently forget your leader.

257
00:19:19,901 --> 00:19:21,801
Just some snacks for the kids.

258
00:19:22,304 --> 00:19:23,236
- Namaste, aunty.
- Hello.

259
00:19:24,139 --> 00:19:25,834
Deepak got a job.

260
00:19:26,241 --> 00:19:27,538
Oh, this is just a temporary job, aunty.

261
00:19:27,609 --> 00:19:29,978
Once he completes his doctorate in
the us, he'll get his real job.

262
00:19:29,978 --> 00:19:33,345
All of us are in for greatjobs soon.

263
00:19:33,915 --> 00:19:35,550
No one can stop
the supreme court from...

264
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,719
granting 27% reservation
for seats in higher education.

265
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:41,022
27% reservation for whom?
And, where will it come from?

266
00:19:41,022 --> 00:19:43,024
Greetings sir, please have a seat.

267
00:19:43,024 --> 00:19:44,855
It is i who should be greeting you.

268
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:47,252
You are a model
for the backward castes...

269
00:19:48,196 --> 00:19:49,686
and great is your principal...

270
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:53,635
for going out of his way
to help backward caste kids.

271
00:19:53,635 --> 00:19:54,693
It's not like that.

272
00:19:55,137 --> 00:19:56,126
He helps everyone.

273
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:58,038
That's indeed the
highest of truths, deepak.

274
00:19:58,073 --> 00:19:59,908
Our principal's heart overflows
with kindness for one and all.

275
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:03,712
And his perennial intention is to furnish each
individual with a modicum of opportunity.

276
00:20:03,712 --> 00:20:04,804
Modicum of opportunity?

277
00:20:05,647 --> 00:20:07,308
Meaning that he gives
everyone a chance.

278
00:20:07,349 --> 00:20:08,907
Then why don't you say chance?

279
00:20:09,184 --> 00:20:10,708
That's exactly what i indicated.

280
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,090
Did you guys hear what
pandit here just indicated?

281
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:39,114
Chance!

282
00:20:39,114 --> 00:20:41,912
Spread your wings and you'll take flight

283
00:20:42,684 --> 00:20:45,551
give me a chance and
you'll have the sky in sight

284
00:20:53,094 --> 00:20:56,231
spread your wings and you'll take flight

285
00:20:56,231 --> 00:20:59,598
give me a chance and
you'll have the sky in sight

286
00:20:59,901 --> 00:21:02,631
draw a starting line, one for all

287
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:05,936
draw a starting line, one for all

288
00:21:06,675 --> 00:21:09,610
and you'll know if courage or
god is above all

289
00:21:10,512 --> 00:21:13,504
just give me a chance

290
00:21:13,615 --> 00:21:18,453
just give me one chance, my dear,
oh my dear

291
00:21:18,453 --> 00:21:19,852
and watch me take flight

292
00:21:20,055 --> 00:21:24,549
just give me one chance, my dear,
oh my dear

293
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,593
and watch me take flight

294
00:21:26,895 --> 00:21:31,229
just give me one chance, my dear,
oh my dear

295
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,262
and watch me take flight

296
00:21:34,135 --> 00:21:36,968
give me a chance, please

297
00:21:37,606 --> 00:21:40,234
give me a chance, please

298
00:21:48,483 --> 00:21:51,145
chance

299
00:21:51,486 --> 00:21:54,717
just give me a chance

300
00:21:54,923 --> 00:21:57,653
it showers it's glow with every step

301
00:21:58,593 --> 00:22:00,151
let me see your moves

302
00:22:01,763 --> 00:22:04,493
my sweet darling

303
00:22:05,066 --> 00:22:07,933
take it, take it all

304
00:22:08,169 --> 00:22:10,694
just one chance

305
00:22:11,573 --> 00:22:14,770
the one who owns the bat and the ball

306
00:22:14,943 --> 00:22:18,037
he writes the rules and wins it all

307
00:22:21,783 --> 00:22:24,980
how long will you
keep this up this game?

308
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:30,047
Why don't you set up
a stadium of hope?

309
00:22:30,592 --> 00:22:31,957
Just one chance

310
00:22:33,762 --> 00:22:36,595
watch me as i step on the field

311
00:22:37,098 --> 00:22:39,658
watch me as i step on the field

312
00:22:40,535 --> 00:22:43,231
you will see my aspirations flying high

313
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:46,833
just give me a chance

314
00:22:47,175 --> 00:22:51,942
just give me one chance, my dear,
oh my dear

315
00:22:52,213 --> 00:22:53,771
and watch me take flight

316
00:22:53,949 --> 00:22:58,283
just give me one chance, my dear,
oh my dear

317
00:22:59,054 --> 00:22:59,611
and watch me take flight

318
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:05,553
just give me one chance, my dear,
oh my dear

319
00:23:05,994 --> 00:23:07,859
and watch me take flight

320
00:23:13,168 --> 00:23:14,760
watch me take flight

321
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:21,573
watch me take flight

322
00:23:22,877 --> 00:23:24,242
just one chance

323
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:38,760
panditji? What have you scored?

324
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,853
85.3%, poorbi.

325
00:23:41,062 --> 00:23:43,622
Wow! That means you are
definitely getting into engineering.

326
00:23:43,932 --> 00:23:45,763
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

327
00:23:47,235 --> 00:23:48,896
- Glory to k. K!

328
00:23:49,137 --> 00:23:50,968
Congratulations, sir.

329
00:23:51,006 --> 00:23:52,166
Three new courses this year!

330
00:23:56,778 --> 00:23:58,006
- Namaskar.
- Namaste.

331
00:23:58,046 --> 00:23:59,377
You are god, sir.

332
00:23:59,814 --> 00:24:02,408
My son had flunked twice but
with your help he cleared the exam.

333
00:24:02,884 --> 00:24:03,885
We feel blessed, sir.

334
00:24:03,885 --> 00:24:06,080
Now your brother, the minister,
will take care of things.

335
00:24:06,187 --> 00:24:08,087
I won't go to any college but s.t.m.

336
00:24:08,723 --> 00:24:10,953
Sir, but you're a professor at s.t.m.

337
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,820
Please use your clout.

338
00:24:13,228 --> 00:24:13,990
We'll pay any amount.

339
00:24:14,029 --> 00:24:15,930
There's nothing i can do!

340
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:18,296
Without s.t.m. Life is meaningless.

341
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:22,064
He will commit suicide, sir.

342
00:24:24,305 --> 00:24:26,671
Only the minister can save him then.

343
00:24:30,111 --> 00:24:31,009
Come, please come...

344
00:24:32,247 --> 00:24:33,771
hello... please sit.

345
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:37,483
Deepak kumar and kamlesh narayan.

346
00:24:37,852 --> 00:24:42,016
It's my pleasure to introduce
these two newjunior lecturers.

347
00:24:43,124 --> 00:24:44,022
Go, meet them.

348
00:24:46,795 --> 00:24:47,693
Welcome...

349
00:24:50,832 --> 00:24:53,232
why are you wasting
your time here, mr. Deepak kumar?

350
00:24:54,035 --> 00:24:55,696
Make use of the reservation rule.

351
00:24:56,271 --> 00:24:58,466
The government is doling outjobs
to you people in charity.

352
00:24:59,874 --> 00:25:01,865
It's you people who've been
living on charity, sir.

353
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:04,178
By snatching from us
what is rightfully ours.

354
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:08,816
But now, when you have to give it back,
it hurts, doesn't it?

355
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:18,126
You are the minister for education,
you practically run the government.

356
00:25:18,126 --> 00:25:20,026
But you can't get admission
for your only nephew?

357
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:22,086
Oh stop crying, please!

358
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:24,062
I'm getting it done.

359
00:25:24,733 --> 00:25:25,995
Sir, it's impossible at s.t.m.

360
00:25:26,234 --> 00:25:27,166
No one can do that.

361
00:25:27,435 --> 00:25:29,104
Why is it so difficult, verma?

362
00:25:29,104 --> 00:25:32,006
Sir, over the past 35 years,
principal prabhakar anand has...

363
00:25:32,006 --> 00:25:36,344
nurtured the college in every way
on his own.

364
00:25:36,344 --> 00:25:37,746
Even the government can't interfere.

365
00:25:37,746 --> 00:25:40,044
Last year, he refused admission
to the home secretary's daughter.

366
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:40,843
Really?!

367
00:25:42,317 --> 00:25:44,979
In that case,
i have to meet this principal.

368
00:25:46,354 --> 00:25:49,152
Aniruddha prasad is the secretary
of the s.t.m. Trust.

369
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,959
Let's have a word with him.

370
00:25:50,959 --> 00:25:51,755
Yes, please do.

371
00:25:51,993 --> 00:25:54,461
We've got more than
10,000 applications this time.

372
00:25:56,765 --> 00:25:57,163
Hello...

373
00:25:58,199 --> 00:26:00,468
the first cut off list is 94%.

374
00:26:00,468 --> 00:26:02,570
Your daughter has scored 76%.

375
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:04,162
It's impossible, navneetji.

376
00:26:08,209 --> 00:26:11,079
You've made millions
as a secretary in the government.

377
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:12,512
Time to put it to use.

378
00:26:12,914 --> 00:26:16,179
You can buy a seat
in any college for your daughter!

379
00:26:23,691 --> 00:26:26,023
Aniruddha has come with
the minister for education.

380
00:26:27,295 --> 00:26:29,531
Baburam chaudhary,
the minister for education.

381
00:26:29,531 --> 00:26:30,293
Namaskar.

382
00:26:30,765 --> 00:26:33,668
It's great to see that you go
for a run in the morning, sir.

383
00:26:33,668 --> 00:26:36,603
No wonder that even the college
is in such terrific shape.

384
00:26:36,871 --> 00:26:38,202
What has your nephew scored?

385
00:26:38,606 --> 00:26:39,971
His score is low.

386
00:26:40,909 --> 00:26:44,538
But, in any case, no one in our family
ever managed to score above 40%.

387
00:26:44,746 --> 00:26:47,015
But all thanks to k.k. Coaching...

388
00:26:47,015 --> 00:26:50,285
they made him slog
at memorising everything...

389
00:26:50,285 --> 00:26:51,809
and he scored 52.07%.

390
00:26:54,189 --> 00:26:55,816
I'm sorry but i can't help you.

391
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,118
Don't say that, sir.

392
00:26:57,826 --> 00:27:00,351
Please don't say that.
He is my sister's only son.

393
00:27:00,395 --> 00:27:04,161
He doesn't want anything except s.t.m.

394
00:27:06,067 --> 00:27:07,068
If you'll kindly excuse me...

395
00:27:07,068 --> 00:27:07,902
i have some things
to take care of.

396
00:27:07,902 --> 00:27:09,893
Aniruddha, please look after him.

397
00:27:11,139 --> 00:27:12,299
Sir, just listen to me.

398
00:27:13,341 --> 00:27:16,708
Oh! So this is where you run
your private coaching.

399
00:27:16,845 --> 00:27:19,109
But why are you taking
classes in your backyard?

400
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,214
I have lots of space
in my commercial complex.

401
00:27:21,249 --> 00:27:24,150
You can hold your classes there.
Your name will attract the students.

402
00:27:24,185 --> 00:27:26,585
You can mint money.

403
00:27:31,993 --> 00:27:34,587
Mr. Minister, our college
pays good salaries.

404
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:41,229
Moreover, we are not allowed
to give private tuitions outside.

405
00:27:46,174 --> 00:27:48,142
You mean all this is for free?

406
00:27:48,676 --> 00:27:49,802
Please come...

407
00:27:50,979 --> 00:27:52,003
have i upset him?

408
00:27:52,113 --> 00:27:55,241
Don't worry, sir.
I'll speak with him.

409
00:27:55,283 --> 00:27:58,620
You advise people to
pay for admission outside.

410
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:01,714
Why not have that system
in your college?

411
00:28:07,128 --> 00:28:08,857
Mr. Minister, you?

412
00:28:09,197 --> 00:28:10,198
You should've sent for me.

413
00:28:10,198 --> 00:28:11,256
Damodar seth...

414
00:28:11,833 --> 00:28:13,357
you are a senior trustee at s.t.m.

415
00:28:13,902 --> 00:28:15,703
For years, i have got you
contracts worth millions...

416
00:28:15,703 --> 00:28:16,971
from the education department.

417
00:28:16,971 --> 00:28:19,064
And yet, you can't get
my nephew admitted?

418
00:28:19,173 --> 00:28:20,401
That's precisely the problem.

419
00:28:21,042 --> 00:28:23,272
The principal controls
the admissions completely.

420
00:28:23,378 --> 00:28:24,436
So that's a 'no'?

421
00:28:25,046 --> 00:28:28,641
If the boy's grade is low,
take money for the admission.

422
00:28:28,983 --> 00:28:30,644
Why are you ruining his career?

423
00:28:31,185 --> 00:28:33,187
Moreover, the college is losing millions.

424
00:28:33,187 --> 00:28:34,381
What sort of education is this?

425
00:28:34,722 --> 00:28:35,323
Don't worry.

426
00:28:35,323 --> 00:28:37,120
How can i not?

427
00:28:38,726 --> 00:28:40,284
My nephew's career is at stake.

428
00:28:40,795 --> 00:28:45,095
I'll have the chief minister call
the founder member shakuntala thakralji.

429
00:28:45,867 --> 00:28:48,427
The chief minister began
his political career through her party.

430
00:28:48,903 --> 00:28:50,939
Your principal
won't be able to refuse her.

431
00:28:50,939 --> 00:28:54,773
Sir, shakuntala quit everything worldly
32 years ago...

432
00:28:54,809 --> 00:28:57,312
to live in an ashram in hrishikesh.

433
00:28:57,312 --> 00:28:58,913
There's no way to contact her.

434
00:28:58,913 --> 00:29:00,039
Listen, don't worry.

435
00:29:00,114 --> 00:29:02,250
I'll take care of your nephew's admission.

436
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,945
I just had a word with the chairman.

437
00:29:04,218 --> 00:29:06,482
At the next board meeting,
we'll cut the principal down to size.

438
00:29:06,988 --> 00:29:10,321
Appoint your own man there,
damodar seth.

439
00:29:10,858 --> 00:29:12,086
It will work wonders.

440
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:15,260
There's no business like education!

441
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,263
Paid service - without guarantee.

442
00:29:17,765 --> 00:29:22,828
Students will pay the fees through their noses
and then be responsible for their own results.

443
00:29:23,338 --> 00:29:27,342
You've reduced the trustees to nothing
more than a rubber-stamp, principal sir.

444
00:29:27,342 --> 00:29:28,376
Damodarji, the agenda...

445
00:29:28,376 --> 00:29:34,749
you have admitted 11 students with 52-55%,
just because they are "underprivileged".

446
00:29:34,749 --> 00:29:36,284
But, you won't accept a
single recommendation of ours.

447
00:29:36,284 --> 00:29:38,753
Damodarji, no one is rejected.

448
00:29:38,753 --> 00:29:40,755
All applications are
still under consideration.

449
00:29:40,755 --> 00:29:42,484
According to me,
they should be rejected.

450
00:29:43,091 --> 00:29:44,752
Will you kindly enlighten us, why?

451
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:52,967
The 11 students you mention have
studied under very difficult circumstances...

452
00:29:52,967 --> 00:29:58,371
without any facilities or coaching classes
and yet managed to get those scores.

453
00:29:59,907 --> 00:30:05,243
If you compare them to the children of ministers,
bureaucrats and rich families...

454
00:30:06,381 --> 00:30:14,516
who have access to good teachers,
schools, facilities and coaching classes...

455
00:30:15,456 --> 00:30:24,966
and yet score only 52.07%...

456
00:30:24,966 --> 00:30:28,868
pray tell, how
i can consider them as deserving.

457
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:33,074
Should you ever recommend
a weak but deserving student...

458
00:30:33,074 --> 00:30:34,507
i shall never disappoint you.

459
00:30:34,609 --> 00:30:38,409
That was one fine speech, principal sir.

460
00:30:39,447 --> 00:30:44,441
But s.t. M belongs to
a private trust created to...

461
00:30:44,485 --> 00:30:48,478
help the children of
our caste come up in life.

462
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:52,519
For the poor and the backward castes
there's the government.

463
00:30:54,562 --> 00:30:56,154
Forgive me, damodarji.

464
00:30:57,098 --> 00:31:00,261
Your views are fatal for
the principles of s.t.m.

465
00:31:02,503 --> 00:31:05,301
S.t.m. Was established
with the sole purpose to offer...

466
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:10,078
the best possible education
to every deserving student...

467
00:31:10,078 --> 00:31:13,980
regardless of caste,
religion, class or community.

468
00:31:14,082 --> 00:31:17,916
But, if you people have decided to
go against that purpose...

469
00:31:19,053 --> 00:31:21,214
i regret to say,
i can't be with you anymore.

470
00:31:21,255 --> 00:31:24,588
Prabhakarji, our views
are no different from yours.

471
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:28,930
Damodar is merely saying that
the trustee quota should be respected.

472
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:29,864
Noted.

473
00:31:29,864 --> 00:31:31,232
The next proposal is to...

474
00:31:31,232 --> 00:31:34,502
appoint a permanent vice principal
to replace kamta prasad.

475
00:31:34,502 --> 00:31:39,574
Excuse me, but why do
we have to decide on this now?

476
00:31:39,574 --> 00:31:43,510
Kamta prasad is still there.
Moreover, dinkar paswan is doing thatjob.

477
00:31:44,011 --> 00:31:45,205
Prabhakarji...

478
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:48,009
surely you don't intend to...

479
00:31:48,049 --> 00:31:51,507
appoint dinkar paswan as
the permanent vice principal?

480
00:31:53,688 --> 00:31:57,988
There are other teachers more senior
and more qualified than him.

481
00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:03,592
I propose that dr. Mithilesh singh
will be most suitable as the vice principal.

482
00:32:04,031 --> 00:32:06,261
Highly qualified and dedicated.

483
00:32:06,467 --> 00:32:08,536
I support the recommendation fully.
Please call him in here.

484
00:32:08,536 --> 00:32:09,002
Ok.

485
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:17,077
Come in, mithileshji.

486
00:32:17,545 --> 00:32:21,538
It's our pleasure to appoint you
as the new vice principal of s.t.m.

487
00:32:22,483 --> 00:32:23,575
I...

488
00:32:24,285 --> 00:32:27,311
will try my best to not disappoint you.

489
00:32:28,589 --> 00:32:29,283
Congratulations.

490
00:32:30,658 --> 00:32:34,321
I'm certain that i will continue
to receive your co-operation.

491
00:32:35,396 --> 00:32:36,158
Trust me.

492
00:32:38,366 --> 00:32:41,733
Thank you very much for my nephew's
admission mr. Vice principal.

493
00:32:41,936 --> 00:32:43,597
All i want is your blessings.

494
00:32:43,938 --> 00:32:46,406
Now you just watch
how we take you to great heights.

495
00:32:47,208 --> 00:32:49,644
How many coaching centres
do you operate currently, mithilesh?

496
00:32:49,644 --> 00:32:50,201
Seven, sir.

497
00:32:50,578 --> 00:32:52,513
What if we raise that to 27?

498
00:32:52,513 --> 00:32:53,377
Excuse me?

499
00:32:53,648 --> 00:32:57,516
The minister will set up k.k. Coaching centers
in all his commercial complexes.

500
00:32:58,052 --> 00:32:59,110
And then in every district.

501
00:32:59,754 --> 00:33:03,212
I already have a plan for a university
on my 110 acres on agra road.

502
00:33:03,257 --> 00:33:05,691
This is the saraswati centre of education!

503
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,764
World class - medical, commerce,
engineering, i.t.

504
00:33:09,764 --> 00:33:11,595
Every bloody subject!

505
00:33:11,632 --> 00:33:13,768
The investment will be
to the tune of 12 billion rupees.

506
00:33:13,768 --> 00:33:16,498
Time for you to establish
a business empire of education.

507
00:33:18,706 --> 00:33:21,776
Consider it done.
By god's grace.

508
00:33:21,776 --> 00:33:25,177
Within a year we'll
list it on the stock market.

509
00:33:25,446 --> 00:33:28,210
And then get at least 50 billion
from the public!

510
00:33:30,785 --> 00:33:33,549
God is great!

511
00:33:45,099 --> 00:33:46,293
What are you doing here?

512
00:33:47,602 --> 00:33:48,864
I'm asking you!

513
00:33:49,704 --> 00:33:52,264
I am putting my knowledge
of science to good use.

514
00:33:52,707 --> 00:33:54,709
And who will attend the
engineering college classes?

515
00:33:54,709 --> 00:33:58,236
I missed out on the admission
by a mere 1%.

516
00:33:58,846 --> 00:33:59,904
But your name was in the merit list!

517
00:34:00,214 --> 00:34:04,583
Yes, i was the last one in the merit list.

518
00:34:05,786 --> 00:34:09,017
But the complicated policy of
reservation denied me my rightful seat.

519
00:34:10,024 --> 00:34:13,187
My life is ruined.

520
00:34:13,628 --> 00:34:14,788
Relax, pandit.

521
00:34:15,796 --> 00:34:17,098
Even if you didn't get
admission into engineering...

522
00:34:17,098 --> 00:34:18,827
life is meaningless!

523
00:34:19,166 --> 00:34:22,169
It's either engineering or
i'll sweep the streets!

524
00:34:22,169 --> 00:34:23,227
No, but...

525
00:34:25,706 --> 00:34:27,196
where did you get these?

526
00:34:27,742 --> 00:34:28,936
Sleeping pills?

527
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:31,744
Are you planning to commit suicide?

528
00:34:33,681 --> 00:34:36,150
This guy is dangerous!
He'll send us to prison.

529
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,879
Don't let him get away.

530
00:34:40,688 --> 00:34:42,990
What's the meaning of this?
You can'tjust barge in like that.

531
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:45,126
Sorry sir, but this is urgent.
We are students of s.t.m.

532
00:34:45,126 --> 00:34:47,194
I am principal prabhakar's daughter.

533
00:34:47,194 --> 00:34:48,829
Oh. How can i help you?

534
00:34:48,829 --> 00:34:49,557
Injustice!

535
00:34:50,364 --> 00:34:53,197
I mean, you can stop this injustice.

536
00:34:53,701 --> 00:34:56,169
He had the last spot
on the admission list.

537
00:34:56,671 --> 00:34:58,901
However, since a backward caste
candidate scored higher...

538
00:34:58,939 --> 00:35:00,341
he was bumped off the list.

539
00:35:00,341 --> 00:35:01,709
I can't do anything about it.

540
00:35:01,709 --> 00:35:02,733
It's just bad luck.

541
00:35:02,977 --> 00:35:03,739
Bad luck?

542
00:35:04,178 --> 00:35:06,578
Sir, his life will be destroyed.

543
00:35:06,681 --> 00:35:07,748
He is contemplating suicide.

544
00:35:07,748 --> 00:35:11,052
Sorry, the rule is that
if a backward caste student scores...

545
00:35:11,052 --> 00:35:13,111
enough to compete
in the open category...

546
00:35:13,154 --> 00:35:15,222
then he gets
admission through that category.

547
00:35:15,222 --> 00:35:17,918
Even if that means a
wasted seat in the reserved category?

548
00:35:18,225 --> 00:35:20,250
Those are the rules.
I can do nothing about them.

549
00:35:20,661 --> 00:35:22,720
Sir, his father is
a janitor in our college.

550
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:25,232
He has studied
against very difficult odds.

551
00:35:25,232 --> 00:35:26,867
I do understand...

552
00:35:26,867 --> 00:35:28,302
but this is the system.

553
00:35:28,302 --> 00:35:29,904
To hell with the system, sir!

554
00:35:29,904 --> 00:35:30,233
What?

555
00:35:31,038 --> 00:35:31,972
Nothing.

556
00:35:31,972 --> 00:35:32,870
Thank you.

557
00:35:33,007 --> 00:35:34,998
See, don't lose heart.

558
00:35:36,277 --> 00:35:38,312
Apply to the
padmavati institute of engineering.

559
00:35:38,312 --> 00:35:39,780
Sir, but the fees...

560
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:42,840
are 500,000 rupees.
Payable in advance.

561
00:35:42,917 --> 00:35:44,111
Even my retirement fund...

562
00:35:44,352 --> 00:35:45,319
don't worry.

563
00:35:45,353 --> 00:35:46,012
Just apply.

564
00:35:46,921 --> 00:35:47,945
You will get a scholarship.

565
00:35:48,356 --> 00:35:52,690
I... i will personally recommend your case
to the dwarka das foundation.

566
00:35:53,327 --> 00:35:54,095
Sir...

567
00:35:54,095 --> 00:35:56,859
don't do that, please...

568
00:35:57,932 --> 00:35:59,923
you are god for us.

569
00:36:02,269 --> 00:36:03,293
Sushant?

570
00:36:06,006 --> 00:36:07,200
Son, what have you done?

571
00:36:07,908 --> 00:36:09,705
You've changed your stream once again?

572
00:36:09,744 --> 00:36:11,234
Dad, how does it matter?

573
00:36:11,278 --> 00:36:12,646
I want to go to jamia university.

574
00:36:12,646 --> 00:36:14,648
I have already appeared for
the entrance test.

575
00:36:14,648 --> 00:36:16,275
And you think
you will get admission there?

576
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:17,408
Of course, dad.

577
00:36:18,018 --> 00:36:20,782
Listen, forget about jamia
and study commerce.

578
00:36:21,021 --> 00:36:22,056
It's business that is -

579
00:36:22,056 --> 00:36:23,353
dad, i don't want business.

580
00:36:24,258 --> 00:36:26,060
I want to do mass comm,
and that's it!

581
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,994
In that case,
you can forget about jamia.

582
00:36:28,462 --> 00:36:30,896
This is their admission list...

583
00:36:31,899 --> 00:36:33,833
and your name doesn't feature in it.

584
00:36:35,202 --> 00:36:38,660
51.5% seats are reserved at jamia.

585
00:36:39,273 --> 00:36:43,175
And, you thought admission
would be easy there?

586
00:36:45,112 --> 00:36:46,977
But dad, i put in a lot of effort.

587
00:36:47,782 --> 00:36:49,113
Even the personal interview went well.

588
00:36:49,683 --> 00:36:53,744
Son, you can forget about
government-supported institutes.

589
00:36:54,155 --> 00:36:56,783
Reservations reign supreme over there.

590
00:37:01,424 --> 00:37:03,221
Let's make it quick.
I've three more lectures to go.

591
00:37:04,327 --> 00:37:05,487
You're late again!

592
00:37:05,562 --> 00:37:07,864
Sharma sir gave notes on quantum today.

593
00:37:07,864 --> 00:37:09,466
Check the sachchar and sachchar text.

594
00:37:09,466 --> 00:37:11,297
They have the best notes on quantum.

595
00:37:14,404 --> 00:37:15,063
What's wrong?

596
00:37:16,339 --> 00:37:17,863
Here, you take half.

597
00:37:17,974 --> 00:37:18,565
50-50.

598
00:37:18,975 --> 00:37:20,272
Why are you letting go even 50%?

599
00:37:21,077 --> 00:37:23,477
Why don't you people
keep it all? 100%.

600
00:37:25,315 --> 00:37:26,145
What did you say?

601
00:37:26,349 --> 00:37:28,249
You heard me.

602
00:37:35,225 --> 00:37:37,853
Finally, the historic ruling that everyone
was impatiently waiting for has been arrived.

603
00:37:37,928 --> 00:37:42,627
For 60 years, we have had 22.5% reservation for
the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes.

604
00:37:42,933 --> 00:37:45,502
However, the recommendation
of the mandal commission that...

605
00:37:45,502 --> 00:37:49,973
the other backward castes be given
another 27% reservation, was under a cloud.

606
00:37:49,973 --> 00:37:52,676
Now, the supreme court has cleared that too.

607
00:37:52,676 --> 00:37:58,548
So, now the reservation in higher education
and governmentjobs will be 49.5%.

608
00:37:58,548 --> 00:38:01,117
These caste-based
reservations have caused...

609
00:38:01,117 --> 00:38:04,054
deep satisfaction as well as
severe discontent in the country.

610
00:38:04,054 --> 00:38:07,182
The so-called upper castes
are perturbed by the developments.

611
00:38:07,324 --> 00:38:10,452
This is abhay raichand with
cameraman akhilesh singh.

612
00:38:17,667 --> 00:38:19,002
What do you think will happen?

613
00:38:19,002 --> 00:38:22,038
If they do our work,
we'll have to do what they were doing.

614
00:38:22,038 --> 00:38:24,674
We'll have to leave our studies
and take up shoe-polishing now!

615
00:38:24,674 --> 00:38:25,402
What else can we do?

616
00:38:25,442 --> 00:38:27,911
These are dark days.

617
00:38:27,911 --> 00:38:29,713
And so it shall be that...

618
00:38:29,713 --> 00:38:32,181
the swan will get discarded grain...

619
00:38:32,482 --> 00:38:34,109
while the crow will be fed pearls.

620
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:49,599
In this democracy,
everyone is meant to have equal rights.

621
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,635
We believe in merit...

622
00:38:51,635 --> 00:38:53,003
not in reservation.

623
00:38:53,003 --> 00:38:58,942
- We're for merit...
against reservation!

624
00:38:59,175 --> 00:39:01,109
Brothers, these are those very people...

625
00:39:01,945 --> 00:39:05,108
who never allowed us
to even sit beside them.

626
00:39:05,515 --> 00:39:08,211
But, now that the supreme court's
decision has arrived...

627
00:39:09,019 --> 00:39:15,425
they're screaming their lungs out that
everyone has equal rights in a democracy.

628
00:39:15,425 --> 00:39:17,290
Don't fall into their trap.

629
00:39:18,561 --> 00:39:21,698
If they had their way, they would
never allow any change whatsoever.

630
00:39:21,698 --> 00:39:25,259
Glory to the supreme court!

631
00:39:28,304 --> 00:39:30,670
Hail, lord mandal!

632
00:39:35,111 --> 00:39:37,170
Time to pack
our bags and leave.

633
00:39:37,313 --> 00:39:38,575
Now these people will rule.

634
00:39:51,127 --> 00:39:52,116
Security...

635
00:39:53,363 --> 00:39:54,694
shut the gate and lock it.

636
00:39:54,731 --> 00:39:55,755
Lock it. Now!

637
00:39:58,802 --> 00:39:59,291
This is the problem with our country.

638
00:40:01,337 --> 00:40:04,067
Everyone has the freedom
to stage his own circus.

639
00:40:12,015 --> 00:40:14,609
They are deliberately
dancing outside our gate.

640
00:40:15,218 --> 00:40:15,707
Disgusting.

641
00:40:35,205 --> 00:40:36,536
What are they doing?

642
00:40:44,848 --> 00:40:46,475
- Close the gates.

643
00:40:47,517 --> 00:40:49,883
- Throw them out.

644
00:40:54,891 --> 00:40:56,222
Immediately send the police to s.t.m.

645
00:40:56,259 --> 00:40:58,328
Thousands of rioters
have gathered here.

646
00:40:58,328 --> 00:40:58,794
Yes... hurry!

647
00:41:00,797 --> 00:41:02,025
What is the need
to call the police, sir?

648
00:41:02,799 --> 00:41:03,527
They will leave now.

649
00:41:04,367 --> 00:41:05,425
Of course, they'll leave.

650
00:41:05,869 --> 00:41:07,131
Either on their own
or by getting kicked out.

651
00:41:07,403 --> 00:41:09,303
You guys don't know
any other language, anyway.

652
00:41:29,125 --> 00:41:31,227
Whoever's gone out
should not come back in.

653
00:41:31,227 --> 00:41:32,888
Sushant, what are you doing?!

654
00:41:32,929 --> 00:41:34,055
Let them back in.

655
00:41:34,397 --> 00:41:35,329
You also go out...

656
00:41:35,565 --> 00:41:36,623
go dance with them.

657
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,364
Have you lost it?

658
00:41:38,468 --> 00:41:39,901
No, i haven't.

659
00:41:40,336 --> 00:41:41,997
In fact, i've finally realised that...

660
00:41:42,438 --> 00:41:45,842
for merit... against reservation!

661
00:41:45,842 --> 00:41:46,536
Hold on.

662
00:42:02,458 --> 00:42:04,394
What's happening? Stop it.

663
00:42:04,394 --> 00:42:06,123
Sushant, have you gone mad?

664
00:42:06,329 --> 00:42:07,130
You shut up!

665
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:08,324
And get out of here!!

666
00:42:10,867 --> 00:42:11,959
Don't even think about it.

667
00:42:12,635 --> 00:42:14,569
We haven't forgotten how to drive cattle!

668
00:42:15,405 --> 00:42:16,303
You will regret it.

669
00:42:22,579 --> 00:42:23,341
Stop it!

670
00:42:24,214 --> 00:42:25,044
- Stop it!

671
00:42:25,181 --> 00:42:26,876
- For merit... against reservation!

672
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:28,412
Stop it!

673
00:42:28,518 --> 00:42:29,252
I said, shut up!

674
00:42:29,252 --> 00:42:30,549
- For merit... against reservation!

675
00:42:30,587 --> 00:42:31,679
- Shut up!

676
00:42:32,121 --> 00:42:33,356
Shut up!

677
00:42:33,356 --> 00:42:34,482
Shut up!

678
00:42:38,228 --> 00:42:39,991
It's okay, officer. You may leave.

679
00:42:40,029 --> 00:42:40,961
Thank you very much.

680
00:42:41,364 --> 00:42:42,456
Bring our students in.

681
00:42:43,399 --> 00:42:44,058
Come on in.

682
00:42:45,134 --> 00:42:45,691
Get inside!

683
00:42:51,274 --> 00:42:54,437
Everyone!
Gather at the assembly...

684
00:42:54,978 --> 00:42:55,376
now!

685
00:43:03,453 --> 00:43:04,545
Who called the police?

686
00:43:08,291 --> 00:43:09,383
Who called the police?

687
00:43:10,093 --> 00:43:13,930
The manner in which
a riot was breaking out, i...

688
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:16,398
we have never needed to
call the police in this college.

689
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,094
And, without my permission
you will never do so again.

690
00:43:20,136 --> 00:43:20,536
The situation was...

691
00:43:20,536 --> 00:43:21,400
never!

692
00:43:21,571 --> 00:43:22,697
Never again!

693
00:43:23,239 --> 00:43:24,035
Am i understood?

694
00:43:25,742 --> 00:43:27,039
Yes... sir.

695
00:43:30,613 --> 00:43:35,277
I will never tolerate
anyone who breaks discipline.

696
00:43:37,186 --> 00:43:42,647
I want the names of all those students
who were at the gate.

697
00:43:42,759 --> 00:43:44,659
You will never do this again!

698
00:43:45,662 --> 00:43:48,597
Today you have brought disrepute
to this institution.

699
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:51,657
Sushant seth...

700
00:43:53,436 --> 00:43:54,130
deepak kumar.

701
00:43:55,571 --> 00:43:59,007
Your irresponsible conduct
has shamed this college.

702
00:43:59,042 --> 00:43:59,667
Sir, the fault is theirs.

703
00:43:59,709 --> 00:44:02,109
Just a minute.
Listen to me!

704
00:44:02,178 --> 00:44:02,974
Sir, i...

705
00:44:03,112 --> 00:44:04,511
listen... listen to me!

706
00:44:04,714 --> 00:44:05,703
And listen carefully.

707
00:44:08,685 --> 00:44:11,483
This is my last warning to you...
and to those with you.

708
00:44:12,422 --> 00:44:15,414
I will not tolerate this hooliganism!

709
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:19,392
I won't hesitate to
expel you two from this college.

710
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:38,471
What is this?

711
00:44:39,515 --> 00:44:40,641
Tickets for yoga classes.

712
00:44:42,385 --> 00:44:43,374
I'm busy.

713
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,548
But, it's an evening show.

714
00:44:45,955 --> 00:44:46,478
Please...

715
00:44:54,063 --> 00:44:55,496
can't you forget what happened?

716
00:44:58,901 --> 00:44:59,333
It's a 1000-year old story, poorbi.

717
00:45:01,304 --> 00:45:03,431
Repeated everyday - a million times!

718
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,704
Even if i want to,
i'm not allowed to forget.

719
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:16,584
Hey! An email from cornell!

720
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:19,144
Your paper's been accepted!

721
00:45:20,023 --> 00:45:21,183
You're going to america!

722
00:45:22,658 --> 00:45:23,682
Congratulations.

723
00:45:26,062 --> 00:45:26,289
Thanks.

724
00:45:28,097 --> 00:45:30,588
Don't we even have the
freedom to celebrate openly?

725
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,465
Shame on us!

726
00:45:33,369 --> 00:45:35,200
It's shameful that sushant was let off!

727
00:45:35,338 --> 00:45:36,566
But we won't tolerate it anymore...

728
00:45:36,606 --> 00:45:37,373
no matter who it is.

729
00:45:37,373 --> 00:45:38,067
Shut up!

730
00:45:38,674 --> 00:45:40,505
What are you
crying revolution now for?

731
00:45:41,277 --> 00:45:43,006
The supreme court
has already created history.

732
00:45:43,179 --> 00:45:45,948
No matter how much the
upper castes jump and dance now...

733
00:45:45,948 --> 00:45:48,075
no one can erase the stamp of 27%!

734
00:45:48,384 --> 00:45:49,316
It's sealed now!

735
00:45:50,219 --> 00:45:52,278
They'll know tomorrow morning.
Just watch!

736
00:46:01,397 --> 00:46:04,059
Reservation is our birthright!

737
00:46:04,233 --> 00:46:05,291
Oh god!

738
00:46:05,701 --> 00:46:06,725
Who has done this?

739
00:46:08,137 --> 00:46:09,069
Who has written this?

740
00:46:09,739 --> 00:46:10,603
Who has written this?!

741
00:46:11,507 --> 00:46:13,236
If you have the guts, step forward!

742
00:46:16,512 --> 00:46:18,036
These people will never get it.

743
00:46:18,781 --> 00:46:21,648
They're like cowardly snakes...
strike and scurry back into the burrow.

744
00:46:22,985 --> 00:46:24,384
Something will have to be done
about them.

745
00:46:24,987 --> 00:46:26,386
Whoever has done this,
it's not right.

746
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:29,749
Chhotu, get me a bucket of water.

747
00:46:29,992 --> 00:46:31,721
Where's the need to erase this,
mr. Deepak kumar?

748
00:46:32,061 --> 00:46:33,153
Just tweak it a little bit.

749
00:46:33,629 --> 00:46:35,620
Instead of 'reservation', write 'charity'.

750
00:46:36,466 --> 00:46:37,763
'Charity is our birthright.'

751
00:46:38,434 --> 00:46:41,665
For 60 years, we've suffered the scheduled
caste and scheduled tribe reservation.

752
00:46:42,338 --> 00:46:44,363
And now, the other backward castes!

753
00:46:45,575 --> 00:46:48,567
Our children slog throughout the year...

754
00:46:49,312 --> 00:46:52,213
but when it comes to admissions,
you just rake in the loot!

755
00:46:53,716 --> 00:46:55,343
Scared of working hard, aren't you?

756
00:46:55,818 --> 00:46:56,341
Really?!

757
00:46:58,321 --> 00:46:59,652
You'll teach us hard work, will you?

758
00:47:01,023 --> 00:47:02,513
What else have we done until now?

759
00:47:03,493 --> 00:47:05,484
If you've forgotten,
go read your history again.

760
00:47:05,695 --> 00:47:07,424
Then you'll know who slogged...

761
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:09,395
and who looted it
like it was their birthright.

762
00:47:09,665 --> 00:47:12,668
For centuries you people
filled up your coffers with handouts...

763
00:47:12,668 --> 00:47:14,533
and you accuse us of living on charity?

764
00:47:15,037 --> 00:47:16,197
We ploughed your fields...

765
00:47:16,772 --> 00:47:19,434
we reaped your corn,
grazed your cattle...

766
00:47:20,543 --> 00:47:22,670
we carried your daughters
and wives' palanquins...

767
00:47:24,213 --> 00:47:25,407
we cremated your corpses...

768
00:47:25,581 --> 00:47:27,446
stitched your shoes,
drove your oxen, rowed your boats...

769
00:47:27,483 --> 00:47:29,352
cleaned your filthy drains...

770
00:47:29,352 --> 00:47:31,252
and we even carried your shit on our heads.

771
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,514
And you're going to teach us hard work?

772
00:47:32,622 --> 00:47:35,113
You're absolutely right.
That's all that you're good for!

773
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:36,586
That is all you're worth.

774
00:47:36,859 --> 00:47:38,121
And you deserve to be like that.

775
00:47:38,494 --> 00:47:40,655
Here, we're talking about
building our nations' future.

776
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:43,457
And only the deserving will get a position.

777
00:47:43,633 --> 00:47:46,261
But you guys want
everything free of cost.

778
00:47:46,736 --> 00:47:49,296
The truth is that you are
scared of competition.

779
00:47:50,506 --> 00:47:52,064
Which competition are you talking about?

780
00:47:53,242 --> 00:47:55,233
The one that you
never let us participate in?

781
00:47:55,678 --> 00:47:57,771
The door of every school
was closed for us.

782
00:47:58,481 --> 00:48:01,851
And, if we got in somehow,
we were relegated to the back benches.

783
00:48:01,851 --> 00:48:04,654
You controlled all the schools...
the hospitals... police stations...

784
00:48:04,654 --> 00:48:06,451
every support system belonged to you!

785
00:48:09,358 --> 00:48:11,656
Do you know why you
never let us compete?

786
00:48:12,728 --> 00:48:16,095
Because you were afraid of
a level competition... not us.

787
00:48:16,432 --> 00:48:18,559
Don't use history to
hide your weaknesses.

788
00:48:19,502 --> 00:48:21,766
Nothing of this sort happens
in our generation.

789
00:48:22,405 --> 00:48:24,873
If you have the guts,
accept the challenge and fight.

790
00:48:25,374 --> 00:48:28,275
But you won't do that.
Because, for that you need merit -

791
00:48:28,311 --> 00:48:29,744
which you clearly don't have!

792
00:48:30,446 --> 00:48:32,311
We're ready to compete with you on merit.

793
00:48:33,115 --> 00:48:36,107
But the starting line for the race
should be the same for everyone.

794
00:48:36,552 --> 00:48:40,750
First, tell your pop to vacate
his ancestral mansion and live in our slums.

795
00:48:40,923 --> 00:48:45,261
Ask him to wear a company uniform
and go to work as a driver, a doorman or a cleaner.

796
00:48:45,261 --> 00:48:48,389
Tell your mother to leave
her air-conditioned house and...

797
00:48:48,731 --> 00:48:51,325
accompany our mothers
to clean other people's homes.

798
00:48:51,801 --> 00:48:54,136
Tell your sister that, as soon as
she wakes up every morning...

799
00:48:54,136 --> 00:48:57,731
to fetch water from the municipal tap in
the neighbourhood.

800
00:48:58,741 --> 00:49:02,142
Come with us! Sample our lives.
And then lecture us!

801
00:49:02,945 --> 00:49:04,708
We will compete with you on merit too.

802
00:49:05,281 --> 00:49:06,714
But until you do all that...

803
00:49:07,483 --> 00:49:09,417
keep your ridiculous hogwash to yourself!

804
00:49:30,906 --> 00:49:34,239
In spite of the severe
last warning yesterday...

805
00:49:35,344 --> 00:49:37,437
you were misbehaving again toay.

806
00:49:39,115 --> 00:49:43,518
It's obvious that you don't respect
the code of conduct of this college.

807
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:48,652
Sushant seth, for your unruly conduct...

808
00:49:49,525 --> 00:49:50,924
i hereby rusticate you from s.t.m.

809
00:49:51,427 --> 00:49:52,519
Sir, you can't do this!

810
00:49:53,629 --> 00:49:55,392
I haven't misbehaved in any way.

811
00:49:56,098 --> 00:49:58,434
In fact, yesterday
i was just trying to stop them.

812
00:49:58,434 --> 00:49:59,594
And i was doing the same, today.

813
00:50:01,304 --> 00:50:03,306
They create a ruckus,
damage college property...

814
00:50:03,306 --> 00:50:04,295
they abuse us...

815
00:50:04,573 --> 00:50:06,598
they openly destroy s.t.m.'s reputation...

816
00:50:07,643 --> 00:50:09,235
i will not be a mute spectator in all this!

817
00:50:09,645 --> 00:50:12,671
And, since when have you been appointed
the security chief and moral guardian here?

818
00:50:13,683 --> 00:50:15,951
If you had any complaint,
why didn't you come to me?

819
00:50:15,951 --> 00:50:17,077
That would have made no difference, sir.

820
00:50:17,553 --> 00:50:20,215
You would never have taken
any action against deepak kumar.

821
00:50:20,256 --> 00:50:21,086
Everyone knows that!

822
00:50:24,193 --> 00:50:24,591
What?!

823
00:50:26,095 --> 00:50:26,959
Out!

824
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:28,124
Get out of here!

825
00:50:28,497 --> 00:50:29,054
Now!!

826
00:50:32,668 --> 00:50:36,968
Sir, even you are supporting
those people who are ruining our lives.

827
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:45,738
Sushant, what?

828
00:50:46,182 --> 00:50:47,376
Sushant, what happened?

829
00:50:47,483 --> 00:50:48,575
Get lost!

830
00:50:51,087 --> 00:50:55,224
Sir, i had no intention of getting
into an argument with anyone.

831
00:50:55,224 --> 00:50:57,658
Least of all with the vice principal.

832
00:50:58,561 --> 00:50:59,729
But, given the kind of remarks
that were made there...

833
00:50:59,729 --> 00:51:03,130
it became impossible for me to remain silent.

834
00:51:03,733 --> 00:51:06,224
Can i know what your compulsion was?

835
00:51:06,736 --> 00:51:07,998
My identity, sir.

836
00:51:08,437 --> 00:51:12,373
Sushant and mithileshji were
repeatedly insulting our caste... our people...

837
00:51:13,175 --> 00:51:14,073
your people?!

838
00:51:16,579 --> 00:51:20,015
Since when did you begin speaking
this language of caste politics?

839
00:51:20,349 --> 00:51:21,817
You are a teacher...

840
00:51:21,817 --> 00:51:23,444
who should be above such things.

841
00:51:23,619 --> 00:51:25,553
It's easy for you to say that, sir.

842
00:51:26,088 --> 00:51:28,249
But, my birth leaves me no choice.

843
00:51:29,225 --> 00:51:31,352
For centuries,
we have endured abuses and insults.

844
00:51:32,495 --> 00:51:34,554
Now, we will not tolerate it anymore, sir!

845
00:51:35,164 --> 00:51:37,496
It is incredible that a
teacher is using such language.

846
00:51:38,768 --> 00:51:41,203
You're repeatedly violating
the discipline of s.t. M... .

847
00:51:41,203 --> 00:51:42,101
Discipline?

848
00:51:43,105 --> 00:51:46,165
Sir, our entire society is
struggling with a historic upheaval outside...

849
00:51:46,275 --> 00:51:47,833
and all you can think of is discipline?!

850
00:51:50,045 --> 00:51:52,513
You will not speak to me like this!

851
00:51:55,151 --> 00:51:55,674
Alright, sir.

852
00:51:57,787 --> 00:51:59,618
But, just answer one question of mine.

853
00:51:59,789 --> 00:52:04,055
What is your stand on
the supreme court's verdict?

854
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:05,561
I haven't called you here to debate...

855
00:52:05,561 --> 00:52:08,325
sir, you can't ignore
this question anymore.

856
00:52:09,298 --> 00:52:12,665
If you're not for reservation,
then you're against it.

857
00:52:13,235 --> 00:52:15,396
There is no safe middle ground left.

858
00:52:16,705 --> 00:52:18,138
What is your position?

859
00:52:19,408 --> 00:52:23,276
I do not have to explain
my position to you.

860
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:27,149
And for this misconduct,
i will take disciplinary...

861
00:52:27,149 --> 00:52:29,515
what else can i expect
from a place like this, sir?

862
00:52:30,553 --> 00:52:32,487
Here, i will be punished for telling the truth.

863
00:52:33,355 --> 00:52:34,723
But, no action will be taken against those...

864
00:52:34,723 --> 00:52:37,214
who flagrantly violate the rules of s.t. M!

865
00:52:37,827 --> 00:52:38,555
Look.

866
00:52:40,296 --> 00:52:41,194
Your vice principal.

867
00:52:42,198 --> 00:52:43,859
He openly runs k.k. Coaching classes.

868
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:47,330
He earns millions
but all his sins are forgiven, sir.

869
00:52:48,370 --> 00:52:49,837
After all, his identity is different from mine!

870
00:52:52,208 --> 00:52:56,577
Are you making an allegation
of casteism against me?

871
00:52:57,813 --> 00:52:59,678
Are you trying to accuse me...

872
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:02,908
of being a casteist?

873
00:53:08,657 --> 00:53:10,852
Thank you...

874
00:53:13,829 --> 00:53:16,127
for holding such an opinion of me.

875
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:20,132
Thank you... very very much.

876
00:53:20,903 --> 00:53:22,131
Now you may leave.

877
00:53:23,739 --> 00:53:26,867
And, never try to come before me again.

878
00:53:28,143 --> 00:53:28,700
Ever!

879
00:53:30,346 --> 00:53:30,744
So...

880
00:53:32,381 --> 00:53:32,847
leave.

881
00:53:35,518 --> 00:53:36,246
Leave!

882
00:54:29,034 --> 00:54:30,058
Why aren't you answering my calls?

883
00:54:39,578 --> 00:54:41,705
You'll have to apologise to my dad!

884
00:54:42,848 --> 00:54:45,043
Have you come here in
this rain only to tell me this?

885
00:54:45,784 --> 00:54:47,183
Who the hell do you think you are?

886
00:54:47,819 --> 00:54:49,684
How dare you talk to my dad like that?

887
00:54:50,889 --> 00:54:53,687
I will not tolerate anyone hurting my dad.

888
00:54:54,293 --> 00:54:55,760
Even if it is you!

889
00:54:57,929 --> 00:54:58,725
Do you know what it means to be hurt?

890
00:55:00,966 --> 00:55:02,092
Or, do you follow the same system:

891
00:55:03,001 --> 00:55:03,899
First inflict hurt.

892
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:06,261
And, then get the victim to apologise?

893
00:55:07,339 --> 00:55:09,136
I can't believe that you are talking like this.

894
00:55:10,242 --> 00:55:13,109
Deepak kumar, whatever
you are today is because of my dad.

895
00:55:13,245 --> 00:55:14,371
You owe everything to him!

896
00:55:16,682 --> 00:55:17,410
That's true.

897
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:20,047
I am who i am because of him.

898
00:55:21,186 --> 00:55:23,746
And no matter what i do,
i can never repay him.

899
00:55:26,258 --> 00:55:29,193
But, today i realized
what a great burden that is.

900
00:55:31,697 --> 00:55:35,360
So, whatever my dad did for
you has now become a burden?!

901
00:55:36,768 --> 00:55:40,172
Have you forgotten those years when he
stayed up full nights preparing you for your exams?

902
00:55:40,172 --> 00:55:41,696
I haven't forgotten anything.

903
00:55:42,774 --> 00:55:44,799
But, i feel that he does all that as charity.

904
00:55:45,911 --> 00:55:48,141
And charity can't bring real change in society.

905
00:55:49,381 --> 00:55:50,643
Poorbi...

906
00:55:51,083 --> 00:55:55,315
by giving a blanket to a poor man,
you might remove the poverty that is inside you.

907
00:55:56,455 --> 00:55:57,353
But, not his.

908
00:55:58,824 --> 00:56:02,021
I haven't come here
to listen to your arguments.

909
00:56:03,095 --> 00:56:04,960
Will you apologise to my dad or not?

910
00:56:09,234 --> 00:56:10,258
I'm asking you...

911
00:56:12,037 --> 00:56:13,265
will you apologise or not?

912
00:56:17,743 --> 00:56:18,368
Fine.

913
00:56:20,412 --> 00:56:21,936
Then, understand this clearly.

914
00:56:23,782 --> 00:56:25,010
I never want to see you again.

915
00:56:29,121 --> 00:56:30,281
Ever.

916
00:56:36,695 --> 00:56:39,323
Oh beautiful life

917
00:56:39,865 --> 00:56:42,163
oh beautiful life

918
00:56:42,501 --> 00:56:45,231
oh beautiful life

919
00:56:45,804 --> 00:56:47,704
oh beautiful life

920
00:56:59,484 --> 00:57:06,253
which cord do you lean on,
which cord do you sever

921
00:57:09,728 --> 00:57:15,064
this beautiful life says
why do you share me

922
00:57:18,737 --> 00:57:24,835
which cord do you lean on,
which cord do you sever

923
00:58:04,216 --> 00:58:08,550
we sowed crops with lot of effort

924
00:58:09,888 --> 00:58:13,449
we picked the best seeds of the lot

925
00:58:15,427 --> 00:58:20,797
watered the soil with a lot of care

926
00:58:21,933 --> 00:58:26,427
and that's when the sprouts smiled

927
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:33,439
fate can very cruel

928
00:58:34,012 --> 00:58:39,211
fate can very cruel

929
00:58:39,885 --> 00:58:43,582
but who can scold it

930
00:58:45,824 --> 00:58:49,988
but who can scold it

931
00:58:52,931 --> 00:58:58,130
which cord do you lean on,
which cord do you sever

932
00:58:59,304 --> 00:59:03,240
oh beautiful life

933
00:59:03,275 --> 00:59:06,039
oh beautiful life

934
00:59:06,144 --> 00:59:09,281
oh beautiful life

935
00:59:09,281 --> 00:59:11,511
oh beautiful life

936
00:59:30,669 --> 00:59:36,039
the mind seems lost in the wilderness

937
00:59:36,508 --> 00:59:40,877
leaves scattered all around

938
00:59:42,447 --> 00:59:47,544
the river is lashing against its banks

939
00:59:48,987 --> 00:59:52,445
the heart awakens from its slumber

940
00:59:54,593 --> 00:59:59,155
storms may come and go

941
01:00:00,565 --> 01:00:05,400
storms may come and go

942
01:00:06,338 --> 01:00:10,274
silence alone is eternal

943
01:00:12,477 --> 01:00:15,913
silence alone is eternal

944
01:00:19,517 --> 01:00:23,681
which cord do you lean on,
which cord do you sever...

945
01:00:27,025 --> 01:00:31,928
oh beautiful life

946
01:00:33,031 --> 01:00:35,022
oh beautiful life

947
01:00:35,734 --> 01:00:37,725
oh beautiful life

948
01:01:00,058 --> 01:01:00,786
namaste sir.

949
01:01:03,161 --> 01:01:04,719
Good morning, sir.

950
01:01:13,505 --> 01:01:14,272
Whose class is this?

951
01:01:14,272 --> 01:01:15,762
Sir, the vice principal's.

952
01:01:18,977 --> 01:01:21,036
He must be on his way.
You people read your notes until then.

953
01:01:21,112 --> 01:01:22,010
He won't come, sir.

954
01:01:23,281 --> 01:01:24,771
Sir, he rarely comes to class.

955
01:01:25,116 --> 01:01:26,981
For the last three weeks,
not even once.

956
01:01:46,071 --> 01:01:46,871
Excuse me...

957
01:01:46,871 --> 01:01:47,303
yes, sir?

958
01:01:47,338 --> 01:01:48,473
Where can i find mithilesh singh?

959
01:01:48,473 --> 01:01:49,774
Sir, in the classroom...

960
01:01:49,774 --> 01:01:50,069
there?

961
01:01:50,108 --> 01:01:50,574
Yes, sir.

962
01:01:54,779 --> 01:02:02,185
...by 12 n is equal to 416.6 mn.

963
01:02:02,253 --> 01:02:03,117
Right?

964
01:02:06,991 --> 01:02:09,084
Please look up the
answer in your 'guess' paper.

965
01:02:12,063 --> 01:02:15,829
Sir, it's actually my brother's class...
but he is ill, you see...

966
01:02:15,967 --> 01:02:20,461
i was only... tr... trying to help...

967
01:02:23,041 --> 01:02:24,175
you can ask the students.

968
01:02:24,175 --> 01:02:25,233
Please report at the college.

969
01:02:26,511 --> 01:02:27,535
And come to the principal's office.

970
01:02:28,246 --> 01:02:28,905
Sir, you...

971
01:02:28,947 --> 01:02:31,177
come to the principal's office.

972
01:02:37,255 --> 01:02:40,315
Prabhakar, please think
calmly before you take any action.

973
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:48,292
In brazen violation
of the rules of this college...

974
01:02:49,267 --> 01:02:53,499
you are running a commercial
coaching institute, mithilesh singh.

975
01:02:54,305 --> 01:02:57,240
You're the victim of a misunderstanding, sir.

976
01:02:57,275 --> 01:03:02,338
First of all, k.k. Coaching
which you visited this morning...

977
01:03:02,547 --> 01:03:03,878
doesn't belong to me.

978
01:03:04,282 --> 01:03:05,408
It belongs to my cousin...

979
01:03:06,217 --> 01:03:07,081
krishna kumar...

980
01:03:07,652 --> 01:03:09,017
k. K.

981
01:03:09,888 --> 01:03:10,877
And, second...

982
01:03:11,856 --> 01:03:14,484
even you run a coaching
class in your back verandah.

983
01:03:15,994 --> 01:03:17,894
People like you won't
understand the difference.

984
01:03:18,963 --> 01:03:21,900
I run classes in my verandah because...

985
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:26,496
in our college, we are unable
to offer special help to our weak students.

986
01:03:26,538 --> 01:03:27,664
Whereas teachers like you...

987
01:03:28,506 --> 01:03:29,996
deliberately miss lectures and thereby...

988
01:03:30,575 --> 01:03:35,512
force students to take private
commercial coaching for your profit.

989
01:03:36,981 --> 01:03:39,313
And that, mr. Mithilesh singh,
is the difference!

990
01:03:41,286 --> 01:03:44,881
I work for the college.
Whereas you...

991
01:03:45,256 --> 01:03:46,587
work against it.

992
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:53,360
You are being served
with a 'show-cause' notice.

993
01:03:54,666 --> 01:03:57,260
In seven days, explain why you
shouldn't be suspended from the college.

994
01:03:57,402 --> 01:03:57,936
Prabhakar...

995
01:03:57,936 --> 01:03:58,402
seven days!

996
01:03:59,637 --> 01:04:00,626
In seven days, i want an answer.

997
01:04:05,009 --> 01:04:06,340
You will get your answer.

998
01:04:10,014 --> 01:04:10,946
Most certainly.

999
01:04:12,483 --> 01:04:16,010
Dr. Prabhakar anand... sir.

1000
01:04:23,094 --> 01:04:24,652
Prabhakar, what are you doing?

1001
01:04:26,331 --> 01:04:28,322
That, which your board
hasn't for the last 11 years.

1002
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,725
If you people had approved
my proposal for remedial classes...

1003
01:04:32,403 --> 01:04:37,175
and had organized free
coaching for our weaker students...

1004
01:04:37,175 --> 01:04:39,109
we wouldn't have had
monsters like k.k. Coaching!

1005
01:04:40,578 --> 01:04:44,708
You're well aware of how these people
are swallowing up our entire education system.

1006
01:04:44,949 --> 01:04:47,713
But, what you propose is
not feasible either, prabhakar.

1007
01:04:48,219 --> 01:04:49,345
And, you know it.

1008
01:04:50,421 --> 01:04:53,982
Morever, s.t.m. Is a private college.
Why, even the government doesn't do that!

1009
01:04:54,492 --> 01:04:55,584
Then why doesn't it?!

1010
01:04:56,394 --> 01:05:00,728
Why isn't it investing most
on its most valuable asset... education?

1011
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,302
In this country, we make the
i.a.s., indian foreign service...

1012
01:05:04,302 --> 01:05:08,705
medical, management, engineering
and every such career so attractive!

1013
01:05:08,773 --> 01:05:12,072
But, that which prepares
students for all these, is totally neglected!

1014
01:05:12,644 --> 01:05:14,312
Like i.f. S and i.a. S...

1015
01:05:14,312 --> 01:05:17,645
why don't we have an
i.t.s. - Indian teaching services...

1016
01:05:17,749 --> 01:05:19,341
to attract the best talent for the job!

1017
01:05:21,619 --> 01:05:26,079
Aniruddha, this parallel education system...

1018
01:05:27,292 --> 01:05:31,319
which thrives on capitation
and private coaching...

1019
01:05:31,729 --> 01:05:32,718
will destroy everything!

1020
01:05:45,643 --> 01:05:50,214
Sir, first you rusticated sushant seth,
and now vice principal mithilesh singh.

1021
01:05:50,214 --> 01:05:51,772
He has alleged that you...

1022
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:57,713
dad, mithilesh sir had
called a press conference...

1023
01:05:58,156 --> 01:05:59,953
where he said some
very nasty things against you.

1024
01:05:59,991 --> 01:06:03,051
I think that is why the editor
of dainik bhaskar, arvind kamal is here.

1025
01:06:03,594 --> 01:06:04,253
He's inside.

1026
01:06:05,163 --> 01:06:08,326
Your vice principal mithilesh singh
has accused you of being autocratic.

1027
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:12,135
And alleged that when he opposed this,
you suspended him.

1028
01:06:12,236 --> 01:06:13,037
He's lying!

1029
01:06:13,037 --> 01:06:14,061
Please, my dear...

1030
01:06:17,375 --> 01:06:18,740
i haven't suspended him yet.

1031
01:06:20,178 --> 01:06:22,874
For regularly breaking the college's rules,
i've issued him a show-cause notice.

1032
01:06:23,281 --> 01:06:24,578
Which rules has he broken?

1033
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:31,779
Mr. Arvind kamal, i don't consider it appropriate
to explain my disciplinary actions...

1034
01:06:32,256 --> 01:06:34,121
through a newspaper.

1035
01:06:35,126 --> 01:06:36,821
But, his allegation is
very serious, prabhakar sir.

1036
01:06:37,195 --> 01:06:40,062
S.t.m. Is a private college
where the rule of reservation doesn't apply.

1037
01:06:41,299 --> 01:06:42,596
But, according to him...

1038
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:44,697
your admission policy is doing precisely that.

1039
01:06:45,703 --> 01:06:48,001
You declare a high cut-off percentage but...

1040
01:06:48,206 --> 01:06:50,834
admit backward caste
students through the backdoor, so to say.

1041
01:06:51,342 --> 01:06:52,274
See, i am a teacher.

1042
01:06:53,644 --> 01:06:56,238
My responsibility
towards each child is the same.

1043
01:06:57,215 --> 01:07:02,320
Proud as i am of my
successful and privileged students...

1044
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:03,621
i am equally concerned
about the weaker and...

1045
01:07:03,621 --> 01:07:05,885
poor students of our society.

1046
01:07:07,158 --> 01:07:11,959
Two indias co-exist in our country...

1047
01:07:12,830 --> 01:07:14,024
mr. Arvind kamal.

1048
01:07:15,333 --> 01:07:18,427
And, if we want our country
to genuinely progress, then...

1049
01:07:18,903 --> 01:07:21,667
we shall have to eliminate
the gap between the two.

1050
01:07:22,006 --> 01:07:24,770
But, is caste-based
reservation the only way to do so?

1051
01:07:25,376 --> 01:07:28,046
Well, if we believe that,
for centuries...

1052
01:07:28,046 --> 01:07:29,847
injustice has been caused because
of caste-discrimination...

1053
01:07:29,847 --> 01:07:32,816
then justice should also
be served bearing caste in mind.

1054
01:07:33,151 --> 01:07:36,211
But what about those children
who have never believed in casteism?

1055
01:07:36,421 --> 01:07:38,787
Who have achieved good
results through hard work?

1056
01:07:39,690 --> 01:07:43,126
But, who now may not get admission
because of this new reservation policy!

1057
01:07:47,165 --> 01:07:48,860
Today, every teacher, every college...

1058
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:51,891
as well as the
government is facing a big challenge.

1059
01:07:53,037 --> 01:07:56,040
On the one hand, they have
to give due opportunities to the...

1060
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:58,372
backward castes,
and encourage their talent.

1061
01:07:59,143 --> 01:08:02,271
But, on the other hand, they have
to be sensitive to the plight of those students...

1062
01:08:03,014 --> 01:08:06,142
who feel they are at a
disadvantage in this new scenario.

1063
01:08:06,717 --> 01:08:09,311
It is evident that you support
the supreme court's ruling.

1064
01:08:11,722 --> 01:08:14,282
I cannot answer that question in the words...

1065
01:08:15,827 --> 01:08:18,193
that you expect me to!

1066
01:08:19,230 --> 01:08:20,331
However, i will say that if...

1067
01:08:20,331 --> 01:08:24,927
we accept this decision in all honesty,
without making a political issue of it...

1068
01:08:24,969 --> 01:08:26,231
then it will benefit our society.

1069
01:08:26,370 --> 01:08:28,304
So, would you want this
reservation policy to be implemented in...

1070
01:08:28,406 --> 01:08:30,966
private colleges and institutions as well?

1071
01:08:31,476 --> 01:08:32,340
Like s.t.m., for instance?

1072
01:08:34,712 --> 01:08:36,805
I don't have the right to comment on this.

1073
01:08:37,115 --> 01:08:37,740
Thank you.

1074
01:08:38,716 --> 01:08:41,276
Dad, don't you feel that
this reservation policy will prove harmful?

1075
01:08:43,387 --> 01:08:44,479
What're you trying to say?

1076
01:08:45,323 --> 01:08:47,450
You say that the backward castes
will get a chance to improve their lot...

1077
01:08:48,493 --> 01:08:49,926
that it'll reduce the gap between us...

1078
01:08:51,395 --> 01:08:52,327
it'll create equality...

1079
01:08:54,265 --> 01:08:55,892
but, the fact is that distances are increasing.

1080
01:08:57,301 --> 01:08:59,098
People are becoming
enemies of one another.

1081
01:09:02,273 --> 01:09:03,433
That is indeed unfortunate, my dear...

1082
01:09:04,108 --> 01:09:05,973
but it's bound to happen, i'm afraid.

1083
01:09:07,011 --> 01:09:09,070
Whenever change has
come about in a society...

1084
01:09:10,381 --> 01:09:12,212
a price has had to be paid for it.

1085
01:09:26,464 --> 01:09:28,898
How can you be
so sure that you are right?

1086
01:09:29,934 --> 01:09:32,402
What could be wrong about
providing equal opportunity to everyone?

1087
01:09:32,470 --> 01:09:33,368
It is wrong!

1088
01:09:34,238 --> 01:09:35,432
Your method is wrong.

1089
01:09:37,275 --> 01:09:37,866
Meaning?

1090
01:09:38,442 --> 01:09:40,774
If you really want the
backward castes to progress...

1091
01:09:41,145 --> 01:09:43,204
then give them the best
possible primary education.

1092
01:09:43,414 --> 01:09:44,916
Build special schools for them...

1093
01:09:44,916 --> 01:09:46,144
big hostels...

1094
01:09:46,184 --> 01:09:47,048
offer scholarships...

1095
01:09:47,385 --> 01:09:51,287
provide them every facility
and train them to compete!

1096
01:09:53,024 --> 01:09:54,821
Why have this... policy of reservation?!

1097
01:09:56,494 --> 01:09:59,429
What you're recommending
should be done in any case.

1098
01:10:00,097 --> 01:10:03,589
But, that is precisely what
we haven't done in 60 years.

1099
01:10:04,368 --> 01:10:05,995
Hence, reservation
becomes even more essential.

1100
01:10:07,838 --> 01:10:12,241
That section of our population,
which is backward simply because of their caste...

1101
01:10:12,843 --> 01:10:15,175
must surely be given a
small window of opportunity!

1102
01:10:15,313 --> 01:10:16,473
Look here, i'm a mother.

1103
01:10:17,181 --> 01:10:18,148
Not mother india!

1104
01:10:19,350 --> 01:10:22,217
So, first and foremost i will
be concerned about my own child.

1105
01:10:22,253 --> 01:10:23,379
That is my duty!

1106
01:10:23,821 --> 01:10:27,848
For me, if a rule threatens her future,
then it is just plain wrong.

1107
01:10:28,459 --> 01:10:29,016
That's it!

1108
01:10:35,062 --> 01:10:35,756
Is that so?

1109
01:10:36,397 --> 01:10:37,056
Thank you!

1110
01:10:40,334 --> 01:10:41,995
The ploy worked perfectly, mithilesh.

1111
01:10:42,870 --> 01:10:46,101
The principal made a
statement in support of reservation.

1112
01:10:47,341 --> 01:10:48,968
Now you just watch.

1113
01:10:49,710 --> 01:10:52,702
If he is not reduced to begging on the streets,
you can change my name!

1114
01:10:53,414 --> 01:10:57,451
But, i don't think you
should take this reservation policy lightly.

1115
01:10:57,451 --> 01:10:59,783
Baburam sir, it won't
make a jot of a difference.

1116
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:03,586
When seats in the open category decrease,
competition will increase.

1117
01:11:03,924 --> 01:11:06,694
And, that is when people will turn
to coaching and private colleges.

1118
01:11:06,694 --> 01:11:09,686
This is 'shining' india!

1119
01:11:10,131 --> 01:11:11,365
Here people of high society...

1120
01:11:11,365 --> 01:11:12,466
are willing to pay any high cost...

1121
01:11:12,466 --> 01:11:14,058
for higher education!

1122
01:11:15,136 --> 01:11:17,331
Moreover, the reservation
rule may get these people admission.

1123
01:11:18,005 --> 01:11:22,908
But, to move ahead in that
too they'll need to spend big money!

1124
01:11:24,879 --> 01:11:26,369
Cheers!

1125
01:11:33,721 --> 01:11:34,119
What is this?

1126
01:11:34,155 --> 01:11:35,850
S.t.m. Should have reservation:
Dr. Prabhakar anand

1127
01:11:41,495 --> 01:11:42,393
those words aren't mine.

1128
01:11:43,397 --> 01:11:45,922
You mean you didn't say
that you support reservation?

1129
01:11:48,035 --> 01:11:53,174
As a teacher, i did express
my personal opinion. But s.t. M...

1130
01:11:53,174 --> 01:11:53,731
personal?!

1131
01:11:54,775 --> 01:11:58,575
Your opinions are personal
as long as you don't speak.

1132
01:11:59,080 --> 01:11:59,739
You're the voice of s.t.m.

1133
01:12:00,147 --> 01:12:04,379
Whatever you say will
be taken as s.t.m.'s policy!

1134
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:08,411
You'll have to retract
this statement, prabhakar.

1135
01:12:09,423 --> 01:12:12,881
That you support reservation -
you'll have to withdraw that opinion.

1136
01:12:16,397 --> 01:12:18,957
I don't consider it necessary
to do any such thing, aniruddha.

1137
01:12:21,702 --> 01:12:22,964
Whatever i said...

1138
01:12:24,505 --> 01:12:26,097
has deep thought and my conviction.

1139
01:12:26,207 --> 01:12:27,674
You are misunderstanding this.

1140
01:12:28,042 --> 01:12:29,669
Oh, we've misunderstood him
alright all this while.

1141
01:12:30,177 --> 01:12:31,007
But tell him...

1142
01:12:31,445 --> 01:12:32,742
politics won't be allowed in this college.

1143
01:12:33,914 --> 01:12:35,814
I was thrown out of college, i kept quiet.

1144
01:12:36,517 --> 01:12:38,075
But this deceit won't be tolerated.

1145
01:12:40,821 --> 01:12:44,825
They'll cancel our seats
and insert a quota system here too.

1146
01:12:44,825 --> 01:12:47,995
I think we should speak
with prabhakarji once.

1147
01:12:47,995 --> 01:12:50,463
Chairman sir, what is left to be discussed?

1148
01:12:50,564 --> 01:12:53,467
Call for an emergency meeting of
the trust and get rid of this arrogant fellow!

1149
01:12:53,467 --> 01:12:54,058
We've had enough!

1150
01:12:54,101 --> 01:12:57,638
Damodarji, a big action like
this will impact s.t.m.'s reputation too.

1151
01:12:57,638 --> 01:12:59,740
Why can't you people
see that he is playing politics?

1152
01:12:59,740 --> 01:13:00,241
Damodarji...

1153
01:13:00,241 --> 01:13:03,644
listen, let me try to
speak with him one more time.

1154
01:13:03,644 --> 01:13:04,906
Yes, that'll be best.

1155
01:13:05,012 --> 01:13:05,671
Yes, sunny?

1156
01:13:09,850 --> 01:13:10,578
When did this happen?

1157
01:13:13,187 --> 01:13:15,178
Take care of your mother.
I'm coming across.

1158
01:13:46,454 --> 01:13:47,944
Not as a trustee today...

1159
01:13:50,191 --> 01:13:51,920
but i'm speaking as a friend.

1160
01:13:54,295 --> 01:13:57,321
Till date, i've never
insisted on anything with you.

1161
01:13:59,033 --> 01:13:59,465
But, today for once...

1162
01:14:01,168 --> 01:14:02,692
just for once, please do what i ask.

1163
01:14:04,672 --> 01:14:08,073
On monday, there's an
emergency meeting of trustees at 10 a.m.

1164
01:14:09,977 --> 01:14:12,673
I've drafted a brief
clarification on your behalf.

1165
01:14:14,982 --> 01:14:16,347
Please sign it.

1166
01:14:19,587 --> 01:14:20,485
Please!

1167
01:14:32,199 --> 01:14:35,436
Prabhakarji, this statement of yours
has put our college in a serious situation.

1168
01:14:35,436 --> 01:14:38,132
What is your agenda?
To support reservations?

1169
01:14:39,573 --> 01:14:42,565
The newspaper printed
that statement out of context.

1170
01:14:43,544 --> 01:14:46,604
The principal is retracting his statement.

1171
01:15:07,301 --> 01:15:09,201
It is my good fortune that
i had the opportunity to...

1172
01:15:11,438 --> 01:15:18,571
serve shakuntala thakral college
for 35 years.

1173
01:15:19,613 --> 01:15:20,807
However, it is clear now that...

1174
01:15:24,618 --> 01:15:26,210
your love...

1175
01:15:27,821 --> 01:15:29,118
and your trust...

1176
01:15:32,393 --> 01:15:34,418
is no longer available to me.

1177
01:15:36,697 --> 01:15:38,130
It is time for me to move on now.

1178
01:15:40,601 --> 01:15:44,662
Thank you and...

1179
01:15:47,474 --> 01:15:48,202
my best wishes.

1180
01:15:56,817 --> 01:15:57,545
Prabhakar...

1181
01:16:38,492 --> 01:16:40,551
the board has appointed
mithilesh singh as the principal, sir.

1182
01:16:41,695 --> 01:16:42,787
He will destroy everything, sir.

1183
01:16:44,698 --> 01:16:47,565
Sir! Please don't go.

1184
01:16:51,572 --> 01:16:52,664
Please come, mithileshji.

1185
01:16:54,908 --> 01:16:56,273
You've come at the right time.

1186
01:16:57,478 --> 01:17:01,710
I personally wanted to
welcome you to the principal's chair.

1187
01:17:02,916 --> 01:17:04,440
Thank you. Thank you.

1188
01:17:05,219 --> 01:17:09,349
But this chair's tenure has ended
with yours, dr. Prabhakar anand.

1189
01:17:10,858 --> 01:17:12,587
I'm calling for a new chair!

1190
01:17:13,761 --> 01:17:14,591
Sure... whatever.

1191
01:17:15,729 --> 01:17:18,465
I hope that you'll take
s.t.m. To even greater heights.

1192
01:17:18,465 --> 01:17:19,833
My best wishes are with you.

1193
01:17:19,833 --> 01:17:20,822
Certainly!

1194
01:17:21,368 --> 01:17:26,567
And it is also certain that
i'll never let it fall from those heights.

1195
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:46,037
Neither of them is answering their phone.

1196
01:18:48,583 --> 01:18:51,313
We can'tjust suddenly ask
them to vacate the house.

1197
01:18:53,188 --> 01:18:55,588
But, surely they can arrange
an alternative in a week or so.

1198
01:19:00,262 --> 01:19:02,025
Dad, this is the street.

1199
01:19:02,998 --> 01:19:04,488
Look, there's shambhu's stable!

1200
01:19:10,839 --> 01:19:12,274
Greetings, guruji.

1201
01:19:12,274 --> 01:19:13,571
Yes, greetings...

1202
01:19:14,643 --> 01:19:16,133
guruji, what's the matter?
All this luggage?

1203
01:19:16,845 --> 01:19:21,043
Yes, we had to come to
our house all of a sudden... but...

1204
01:19:21,383 --> 01:19:24,284
that is your house! B 47.

1205
01:19:24,352 --> 01:19:28,379
But some people put up
these signboards last night.

1206
01:19:29,291 --> 01:19:30,280
I don't know...

1207
01:19:35,864 --> 01:19:37,065
sir, one minute, sir...

1208
01:19:37,065 --> 01:19:39,226
get away!

1209
01:19:43,271 --> 01:19:44,203
What's going on here?

1210
01:19:47,008 --> 01:19:48,407
K.k. Coaching in my house?!

1211
01:19:48,944 --> 01:19:49,638
How can you?

1212
01:19:50,145 --> 01:19:50,873
Get out of here right now!

1213
01:19:52,414 --> 01:19:53,346
C'mon, get out!

1214
01:19:56,017 --> 01:19:56,415
Hello...

1215
01:19:57,285 --> 01:19:59,150
sir, prabhakar uncle is here...

1216
01:19:59,654 --> 01:20:00,586
i'm coming.

1217
01:20:00,622 --> 01:20:01,554
Don't worry.

1218
01:20:03,325 --> 01:20:05,156
...and that is the centre of gravity.

1219
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:06,288
Wow!

1220
01:20:07,262 --> 01:20:08,296
How could you people do this?

1221
01:20:08,296 --> 01:20:09,531
But, for two years you had...

1222
01:20:09,531 --> 01:20:10,899
where's your mother?

1223
01:20:10,899 --> 01:20:13,101
We've rented a place to live...

1224
01:20:13,101 --> 01:20:15,126
and started a coaching
centre in our house?! Great!

1225
01:20:16,505 --> 01:20:17,904
Aren't you students of s.t. M?

1226
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:20,269
I want everybody out of here.
Everybody!

1227
01:20:20,909 --> 01:20:21,376
Uncle...

1228
01:20:21,376 --> 01:20:22,206
you just shut up!

1229
01:20:23,245 --> 01:20:25,907
You have perhaps
no idea what you've done!

1230
01:20:32,387 --> 01:20:33,183
Come...

1231
01:20:33,688 --> 01:20:34,916
what happened? This?

1232
01:20:40,662 --> 01:20:41,094
You??

1233
01:20:42,430 --> 01:20:44,022
You had better stay out of this house!

1234
01:20:44,432 --> 01:20:44,989
Me?

1235
01:20:46,601 --> 01:20:48,937
It is not me, but you
who will go out of the house.

1236
01:20:48,937 --> 01:20:51,531
See, these are my
business premises, dr. Prabhakar anand.

1237
01:20:51,573 --> 01:20:52,699
And you are creating a nuisance here.

1238
01:20:53,375 --> 01:20:56,044
You had said that we
could be here for two years.

1239
01:20:56,044 --> 01:20:58,308
Two years? What nonsense!!

1240
01:20:58,947 --> 01:21:02,178
In friendship, to offer you support
we gave you this house.

1241
01:21:03,118 --> 01:21:05,052
And you betrayed us!

1242
01:21:06,421 --> 01:21:07,718
Kamta and i...

1243
01:21:08,290 --> 01:21:10,492
fought against commercial coaching,
all our lives.

1244
01:21:10,492 --> 01:21:12,050
And here in my own
house you have k.k. Coaching?

1245
01:21:12,294 --> 01:21:13,352
So, what could i do?

1246
01:21:13,562 --> 01:21:15,757
He kept struggling with you...
but to what end?

1247
01:21:16,097 --> 01:21:17,689
Couldn't even build a house for himself.

1248
01:21:18,366 --> 01:21:21,392
You did give us shelter,
but we had no earnings.

1249
01:21:22,270 --> 01:21:26,575
Thank god for mithileshji
that he showed a way to my sons...

1250
01:21:26,575 --> 01:21:28,770
to earn a living and save...

1251
01:21:28,977 --> 01:21:31,446
so, do whatever you
wish to in your rented place?

1252
01:21:31,446 --> 01:21:32,208
Why are you using our house?

1253
01:21:32,247 --> 01:21:33,509
Enough! Enough!

1254
01:21:33,582 --> 01:21:35,709
Stop this family court drama.

1255
01:21:36,351 --> 01:21:37,682
Whoever wants to go wherever, please do.

1256
01:21:38,086 --> 01:21:39,986
For two years this place is ours.

1257
01:21:40,789 --> 01:21:43,622
So, please don't disturb k.k. Coaching classes.
Now, please...

1258
01:21:47,062 --> 01:21:50,190
will you show yourself out or...
should i help?

1259
01:21:52,434 --> 01:21:53,992
Don't you dare touch my dad.

1260
01:21:54,069 --> 01:21:54,728
Get away!

1261
01:21:55,003 --> 01:21:56,163
Let go!

1262
01:21:56,504 --> 01:21:58,267
You don't know who i am!

1263
01:22:00,408 --> 01:22:02,137
Even if you so much as touch our guruji...

1264
01:22:02,344 --> 01:22:03,011
shambhu...

1265
01:22:03,011 --> 01:22:03,568
no, guruji...

1266
01:22:03,812 --> 01:22:05,336
i'll finish them off!

1267
01:22:05,447 --> 01:22:06,141
Shambhu!

1268
01:22:07,582 --> 01:22:09,345
Who do you guys think you are?

1269
01:22:10,018 --> 01:22:11,349
You don't scare me!

1270
01:22:12,087 --> 01:22:16,421
Just that i do not believe in
and practice violence, does not mean that...

1271
01:22:20,228 --> 01:22:22,128
this house is ours,
and we won't leave.

1272
01:22:22,297 --> 01:22:22,626
Shambhu...

1273
01:22:23,732 --> 01:22:26,030
if you have the local
police station's number, then please...

1274
01:22:26,701 --> 01:22:28,100
yes...
please come soon.

1275
01:22:28,370 --> 01:22:29,394
B 47.

1276
01:22:29,738 --> 01:22:30,500
Okay.

1277
01:22:30,805 --> 01:22:32,272
Guruji, in fact i was calling them.

1278
01:22:32,307 --> 01:22:35,037
Station in-charge thakur is on his way.

1279
01:22:35,510 --> 01:22:37,205
Call anyone you want to
dr. Prabhakar anand.

1280
01:22:37,646 --> 01:22:38,840
You can't do a thing.

1281
01:22:41,149 --> 01:22:44,380
See mithileshji, we don't
want to fight with anyone.

1282
01:22:44,819 --> 01:22:46,377
We'll leave from here.

1283
01:22:47,489 --> 01:22:49,184
Yeah sure. You may happily leave.

1284
01:22:49,224 --> 01:22:50,851
But before that, let's just square up.

1285
01:22:51,059 --> 01:22:53,361
2.5 million for setting
up this centre overnight.

1286
01:22:53,361 --> 01:22:55,830
I transferred 186 students here...

1287
01:22:55,830 --> 01:22:58,628
their advance fee of 9.3 million...

1288
01:22:58,667 --> 01:23:02,370
how much is that? Yes, 11.8 million.
Just pay that.

1289
01:23:02,370 --> 01:23:04,395
When did we take
any money from you?

1290
01:23:05,807 --> 01:23:07,502
You've signed a contract!

1291
01:23:08,243 --> 01:23:10,177
K.k. Coaching is
perfect with all paperwork.

1292
01:23:14,783 --> 01:23:15,647
Inspector, this way, please.

1293
01:23:16,084 --> 01:23:18,075
There's a limit to misbehaviour.

1294
01:23:18,386 --> 01:23:19,853
This way please...

1295
01:23:20,088 --> 01:23:21,248
look here.

1296
01:23:23,892 --> 01:23:24,688
Principal sir?

1297
01:23:28,096 --> 01:23:29,859
Sir, i'm station in-charge shaktinath thakur...

1298
01:23:30,598 --> 01:23:31,656
you may not recognize me.

1299
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:35,292
Elder brother of your student,
bhaktinath thakur. He's a police officer now.

1300
01:23:37,372 --> 01:23:38,464
See, inspector, this house is ours.

1301
01:23:40,241 --> 01:23:42,110
Today, when we came here to move-in...

1302
01:23:42,110 --> 01:23:44,408
we saw that these people
have started a coaching centre here.

1303
01:23:44,546 --> 01:23:45,103
Really?

1304
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:46,748
People broke in?

1305
01:23:46,748 --> 01:23:48,340
Hey! See who these people are.

1306
01:23:48,483 --> 01:23:49,711
- Round them up.
- Yes, sir.

1307
01:23:50,452 --> 01:23:50,918
Come...

1308
01:23:51,353 --> 01:23:54,189
mithilesh-babu? You, here?

1309
01:23:54,189 --> 01:23:54,712
Sir...

1310
01:23:55,323 --> 01:23:56,654
my son goes to his coaching centre.

1311
01:23:57,292 --> 01:23:58,657
You're wasting your time, inspector.

1312
01:23:59,127 --> 01:24:00,428
Nobody broke into this house.

1313
01:24:00,428 --> 01:24:04,558
On his own, he gave it to
these kids to reside and run a business.

1314
01:24:05,567 --> 01:24:06,192
Is this true?

1315
01:24:07,202 --> 01:24:09,363
Yes... for two years.

1316
01:24:09,404 --> 01:24:10,438
They're lying!

1317
01:24:10,438 --> 01:24:11,700
We merely allowed them to stay here.

1318
01:24:11,806 --> 01:24:12,431
Just a minute...

1319
01:24:13,308 --> 01:24:13,637
sir...

1320
01:24:14,909 --> 01:24:17,901
who among these broke into your house?

1321
01:24:18,279 --> 01:24:20,747
Just name them and
i'll throw them out right now.

1322
01:24:22,384 --> 01:24:23,214
See, inspector...

1323
01:24:25,286 --> 01:24:29,723
to help my friend kamta prasad's sons,
i allowed them to stay here.

1324
01:24:30,158 --> 01:24:31,853
Not to set up a
coaching center with him.

1325
01:24:32,660 --> 01:24:35,720
Oh, so nobody forced their way in?

1326
01:24:36,831 --> 01:24:40,935
In that case, sir, it's a civil matter,
not a police case.

1327
01:24:40,935 --> 01:24:42,570
But this house is ours!

1328
01:24:42,570 --> 01:24:43,662
That's what i am trying to say, sir.

1329
01:24:44,439 --> 01:24:46,304
It has become an issue
of property and possession.

1330
01:24:47,242 --> 01:24:48,334
Hire a lawyer immediately.

1331
01:24:48,943 --> 01:24:53,782
Sir, senior advocate madan mohan pandey
is an ace in these matters.

1332
01:24:53,782 --> 01:24:56,683
Trust me, he is the right person
to deal with mithilesh singh.

1333
01:24:56,985 --> 01:24:59,476
I'll have a word with him.

1334
01:25:10,765 --> 01:25:12,434
You people settle down in the room.

1335
01:25:12,434 --> 01:25:13,696
I will go meet the lawyer.

1336
01:25:18,473 --> 01:25:22,811
Thank you very much, sir,
for seeing me at such short notice.

1337
01:25:22,811 --> 01:25:24,210
No, no, it's okay...

1338
01:25:25,346 --> 01:25:27,337
actually, i couldn't
understand clearly over the phone.

1339
01:25:27,782 --> 01:25:29,909
Did you sign any
agreement with those people?

1340
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:30,712
No.

1341
01:25:31,352 --> 01:25:33,217
I didn't sign any agreement
for my house.

1342
01:25:34,222 --> 01:25:35,211
It's my friend's family.

1343
01:25:35,890 --> 01:25:37,323
I helped them since i trusted them.

1344
01:25:37,992 --> 01:25:41,758
But, they signed a
contract with mithilesh singh...

1345
01:25:41,963 --> 01:25:43,487
to run a coaching centre there.

1346
01:25:44,833 --> 01:25:46,323
Mithilesh singh - the k.k. Coaching person?

1347
01:25:47,235 --> 01:25:49,465
Both my sons studied at his coaching centre!

1348
01:25:50,371 --> 01:25:52,805
He is a very intelligent person.
Very sharp.

1349
01:25:53,541 --> 01:25:55,566
He never does anything foolish.

1350
01:25:56,644 --> 01:25:57,736
But, i know him personally.

1351
01:25:57,946 --> 01:25:58,970
We can talk with him.

1352
01:25:59,347 --> 01:26:00,939
But, what will we talk about?

1353
01:26:02,250 --> 01:26:05,344
Prabhakarji, i mean we
can work out a compromise.

1354
01:26:06,054 --> 01:26:08,389
Mr. Advocate, i haven't come here
to work out a compromise.

1355
01:26:08,389 --> 01:26:09,253
I want my house.

1356
01:26:10,058 --> 01:26:11,252
Of course, of course!

1357
01:26:11,860 --> 01:26:14,488
We can file a civil suit for eviction.

1358
01:26:15,697 --> 01:26:19,394
But, mr. Prabhakar, you know very well
how long the court's decision takes.

1359
01:26:19,434 --> 01:26:20,635
Could even take years.

1360
01:26:20,635 --> 01:26:21,533
And then, there are expenses.

1361
01:26:22,670 --> 01:26:24,272
Listen to me...

1362
01:26:24,272 --> 01:26:25,796
i'll arrange for a meeting with mithileshji.

1363
01:26:26,274 --> 01:26:27,571
I'll fix it for tomorrow itself.

1364
01:26:27,909 --> 01:26:31,367
You don't you worry.
He's a very reasonable man.

1365
01:26:35,383 --> 01:26:38,614
Thank you very much,
madan mohanji.

1366
01:26:55,170 --> 01:26:57,104
When else will we be of help, sir.

1367
01:26:57,505 --> 01:26:58,904
When we are here,
why should you live in a hotel?

1368
01:27:00,275 --> 01:27:01,476
Please bhabhiji [sister-in-law],
please pack your stuff.

1369
01:27:01,476 --> 01:27:02,610
You people will stay in my house.

1370
01:27:02,610 --> 01:27:04,237
Thank you, dinkar.

1371
01:27:04,579 --> 01:27:05,705
But it will cause inconvenience
to your family.

1372
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:06,637
So what, sir?

1373
01:27:07,482 --> 01:27:09,074
Both my sons will sleep in the balcony.

1374
01:27:09,450 --> 01:27:10,644
We'll sleep in the drawing room.

1375
01:27:11,286 --> 01:27:12,116
The bedroom is yours.

1376
01:27:14,055 --> 01:27:15,089
It'll just be a couple of days.

1377
01:27:15,089 --> 01:27:16,522
We're filing a case tomorrow.

1378
01:27:18,593 --> 01:27:19,928
If you want to file a case...

1379
01:27:19,928 --> 01:27:21,486
my elder son abhishek
will come tomorrow morning.

1380
01:27:22,230 --> 01:27:23,561
He practices at the district court itself.

1381
01:27:23,998 --> 01:27:24,623
Yes... that...

1382
01:27:26,467 --> 01:27:28,332
that would be a great help.
Thank you.

1383
01:27:31,706 --> 01:27:33,071
This is a new case.

1384
01:27:35,510 --> 01:27:36,442
What's the urgency?

1385
01:27:36,945 --> 01:27:38,276
Sir, dr. Prabhakar anand's house has been...

1386
01:27:38,413 --> 01:27:40,347
your honour, it's about my house.

1387
01:27:40,748 --> 01:27:43,581
The defendants have occupied our house,
unauthorized and we're out on the streets.

1388
01:27:44,352 --> 01:27:45,216
I...

1389
01:27:45,253 --> 01:27:46,387
i'm an old man, your honour.

1390
01:27:46,387 --> 01:27:47,755
We need our house desperately.

1391
01:27:47,755 --> 01:27:50,121
Hence, eviction is very essential,
your honour.

1392
01:27:50,391 --> 01:27:52,450
Your honour, we would
like to be a party in this case.

1393
01:27:56,764 --> 01:27:57,287
You are?

1394
01:27:57,665 --> 01:27:59,534
I represent the bank.

1395
01:27:59,534 --> 01:28:02,628
The defendants are debtors of the bank
and that place is their business premise.

1396
01:28:03,037 --> 01:28:05,306
If they are removed from there,
their business will shut down...

1397
01:28:05,306 --> 01:28:07,342
and the bank won't be
able to recover its loan.

1398
01:28:07,342 --> 01:28:08,707
Sir, had you signed this?

1399
01:28:08,977 --> 01:28:09,306
Yes.

1400
01:28:09,444 --> 01:28:10,138
But...

1401
01:28:10,979 --> 01:28:11,980
i am a guarantor for their loan.

1402
01:28:11,980 --> 01:28:13,414
Doesn't concern the house.

1403
01:28:13,414 --> 01:28:14,176
It does now, dad.

1404
01:28:14,515 --> 01:28:16,983
They've linked your guarantee
to this case.

1405
01:28:17,619 --> 01:28:18,643
Why did you sign that?

1406
01:28:21,756 --> 01:28:22,347
Your honour...

1407
01:28:23,424 --> 01:28:25,415
i need some time to study this.

1408
01:28:25,793 --> 01:28:27,488
Please grant us a short date.

1409
01:28:31,766 --> 01:28:32,664
Fourth of may.

1410
01:28:33,101 --> 01:28:34,090
Thank you, your honour.

1411
01:28:41,876 --> 01:28:43,138
Excuse me, excuse me, sir...

1412
01:28:43,444 --> 01:28:44,433
how can you do this?

1413
01:28:44,946 --> 01:28:45,469
That house is ours.

1414
01:28:45,513 --> 01:28:47,215
How can the bank stop us
from living there?

1415
01:28:47,215 --> 01:28:50,585
Sir, based on your guarantee
we gave them a loan to start their business.

1416
01:28:50,585 --> 01:28:52,416
And now you yourself
want to stop their business?

1417
01:28:52,453 --> 01:28:53,454
You are too much!

1418
01:28:53,454 --> 01:28:55,547
I gave a guarantee.
I didn't mortgage my house!

1419
01:28:55,957 --> 01:28:57,515
Do you know what a guarantee means?

1420
01:28:58,026 --> 01:29:00,528
If they can't repay the loan,
you will have to pay it back.

1421
01:29:00,528 --> 01:29:03,865
And if you can't, the bank
will sell your house to recover the money.

1422
01:29:03,865 --> 01:29:07,164
But, that was for a computer centre,
not for coaching classes.

1423
01:29:07,402 --> 01:29:08,494
Don't ask me about all that... please!

1424
01:29:08,603 --> 01:29:10,805
Who else are we to ask?

1425
01:29:10,805 --> 01:29:12,473
You're in-charge of the bank, aren't you?

1426
01:29:12,473 --> 01:29:14,941
I was. Now it's him.

1427
01:29:15,943 --> 01:29:17,410
May your reservation policy flourish!

1428
01:29:18,212 --> 01:29:20,915
My junior by four years
having got a job via reservation...

1429
01:29:20,915 --> 01:29:24,043
mr. Indradev ram has been
promoted as my senior.

1430
01:29:24,419 --> 01:29:25,147
Now, please go to him for your answers.

1431
01:29:26,220 --> 01:29:27,949
Thank you, sir.
And, goodbye!

1432
01:29:45,606 --> 01:29:46,630
What happened?

1433
01:29:49,110 --> 01:29:50,372
Poorbi?

1434
01:29:52,847 --> 01:29:53,836
Poorbi dear...

1435
01:30:00,121 --> 01:30:01,383
what is the matter?

1436
01:30:02,457 --> 01:30:04,584
Dad has given away our house in charity.

1437
01:30:04,926 --> 01:30:05,620
What?!

1438
01:30:06,260 --> 01:30:08,626
By standing guarantee
for kamta uncle's sons' loan.

1439
01:30:10,331 --> 01:30:11,593
What are you saying?

1440
01:30:12,367 --> 01:30:14,961
Just that we no longer
have a house to live in.

1441
01:30:15,002 --> 01:30:16,871
Who says that you don't have a house?

1442
01:30:16,871 --> 01:30:18,862
Our lawyers will fight and get it back.

1443
01:30:19,207 --> 01:30:21,869
But, for now, move from here
and stay in my house.

1444
01:30:22,543 --> 01:30:25,012
Prabhakar, you too are unbelievable.

1445
01:30:25,012 --> 01:30:27,448
While i'm around,
how can you stay in a hotel!

1446
01:30:27,448 --> 01:30:29,643
Bhabhiji, my guest house is vacant.

1447
01:30:30,051 --> 01:30:32,320
You can live there
for as long as you want.

1448
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:34,618
I am truly... grateful, aniruddha.

1449
01:30:35,456 --> 01:30:37,253
I don't want to be a burden. We are...

1450
01:30:38,059 --> 01:30:38,582
we're fine.

1451
01:30:38,659 --> 01:30:40,094
There you go
with your stubbornness again!

1452
01:30:40,094 --> 01:30:42,196
Poorbi, get your stuff.

1453
01:30:42,196 --> 01:30:43,094
Bhabhi...

1454
01:30:44,699 --> 01:30:46,132
prabhakar, you are simply too much.

1455
01:30:46,567 --> 01:30:50,003
It's precisely this stubbornness
that's made the whole world your enemy.

1456
01:30:50,471 --> 01:30:53,541
If only you had listened to me
and not made that mistake...

1457
01:30:53,541 --> 01:30:55,065
you wouldn't be facing this situation today.

1458
01:30:55,543 --> 01:30:56,373
It's still not too late.

1459
01:30:56,411 --> 01:30:58,242
Which mistake are you
referring to, aniruddha?

1460
01:30:59,614 --> 01:31:01,445
Prabhakar, what aniruddha means...
just a second...

1461
01:31:04,352 --> 01:31:05,614
which mistake are you referring to?

1462
01:31:07,054 --> 01:31:09,284
That mistake which i committed...

1463
01:31:09,590 --> 01:31:12,320
by helping kamta's sons to
give him some relief?

1464
01:31:13,461 --> 01:31:15,292
Or that mistake...

1465
01:31:15,329 --> 01:31:19,467
which i committed by supporting
the supreme court's verdict on reservation?

1466
01:31:19,467 --> 01:31:21,702
Prabhakar, for god's sake.
Now at least be...

1467
01:31:21,702 --> 01:31:24,432
practical?
That's what you want to say, right?

1468
01:31:25,406 --> 01:31:29,342
No, aniruddha. For me,
these are not mistakes.

1469
01:31:29,644 --> 01:31:31,134
These are my principles.

1470
01:31:31,612 --> 01:31:33,011
And i believe in them.

1471
01:31:33,581 --> 01:31:35,572
So, know this, once and for all...

1472
01:31:36,717 --> 01:31:38,207
this is how i am.

1473
01:31:38,319 --> 01:31:41,652
I don't have any
intention of changing myself.

1474
01:31:42,023 --> 01:31:43,183
And, my family knows this.

1475
01:31:45,726 --> 01:31:46,249
Thank you.

1476
01:31:58,105 --> 01:31:59,402
What's happened to you, dad?

1477
01:32:00,508 --> 01:32:03,238
How can you insult aniruddha uncle
like this and drive him out?

1478
01:32:04,378 --> 01:32:05,504
You heard what he said?

1479
01:32:05,847 --> 01:32:06,973
So, what was wrong with that?

1480
01:32:08,216 --> 01:32:09,581
He didn't say anything wrong!

1481
01:32:10,551 --> 01:32:12,917
For you, your principles are everything.
That's it.

1482
01:32:14,155 --> 01:32:16,589
Do you ever think about
how your family lives?

1483
01:32:17,425 --> 01:32:19,994
That your daughter has to
endure taunts everyday in college...

1484
01:32:19,994 --> 01:32:21,962
because of your
headline-grabbing statements?

1485
01:32:23,030 --> 01:32:24,497
Does all this make any difference to you?

1486
01:32:25,333 --> 01:32:28,461
What is this you're saying, poorbi?
What's gotten into you all of a sudden?

1487
01:32:28,603 --> 01:32:30,093
Nothing has happened suddenly, mom.

1488
01:32:31,272 --> 01:32:35,003
We've always done
what dad wanted - without question.

1489
01:32:36,143 --> 01:32:37,804
It didn't take me a second
to break off with deepak...

1490
01:32:37,879 --> 01:32:40,404
because he had hurt dad.

1491
01:32:41,549 --> 01:32:44,347
I lost sushant... i lost all my friends.

1492
01:32:45,152 --> 01:32:48,280
But, ask him if he ever bothered
to find out what i want?

1493
01:32:49,557 --> 01:32:53,254
I couldn't get into medicine because
dad wouldn't allow me one grace mark.

1494
01:32:53,427 --> 01:32:55,129
One grace mark!!

1495
01:32:55,129 --> 01:32:56,130
Why?

1496
01:32:56,130 --> 01:32:58,598
Because i'm the great
prabhakar anand's daughter.

1497
01:32:58,966 --> 01:33:01,833
So, i will have to reap the fruits
of his principles.

1498
01:33:02,036 --> 01:33:04,937
You will not speak to your father like this.
Never!

1499
01:33:05,139 --> 01:33:06,834
You're also suffering, mom.

1500
01:33:07,141 --> 01:33:09,143
Otherwise you wouldn't be
in this hotel room...

1501
01:33:09,143 --> 01:33:13,273
while someone else is having fun in your house
because your husband donated it to him.

1502
01:33:13,347 --> 01:33:14,041
Enough!

1503
01:33:15,182 --> 01:33:16,046
Just shut up.

1504
01:33:17,118 --> 01:33:18,619
You've said enough.

1505
01:33:18,619 --> 01:33:19,847
Now, not another word from you!

1506
01:33:20,121 --> 01:33:23,113
I don't know of any person
who is better than your father.

1507
01:33:23,324 --> 01:33:26,191
In a world filled with cowards,
he's a real hero.

1508
01:33:27,628 --> 01:33:29,163
No matter what he says or does...

1509
01:33:29,163 --> 01:33:30,391
i will always stand by him!

1510
01:33:31,499 --> 01:33:33,067
Without any question.

1511
01:33:33,067 --> 01:33:35,627
And, as long as you live with us,
you too will have to do the same.

1512
01:33:36,871 --> 01:33:37,895
Without any question.

1513
01:33:37,939 --> 01:33:39,964
Get it?

1514
01:33:43,044 --> 01:33:44,238
I hate my life!

1515
01:33:54,121 --> 01:33:56,214
I've gone over your... proposal, deepak.

1516
01:33:57,658 --> 01:33:58,522
Interesting.

1517
01:33:59,460 --> 01:34:01,291
I'm lucky to have you as a guide, sir.

1518
01:34:02,229 --> 01:34:05,562
Dr. Prabhakar anand says,
you are the best in applied mathematics.

1519
01:34:05,666 --> 01:34:08,066
He's a fine man.
A great scholar.

1520
01:34:08,402 --> 01:34:10,165
I think, i'll email him right away.

1521
01:34:13,240 --> 01:34:14,229
What's this?

1522
01:34:17,078 --> 01:34:18,375
Do you know anything about this?

1523
01:35:05,359 --> 01:35:05,688
Hello...

1524
01:35:06,127 --> 01:35:06,889
hello?

1525
01:35:07,662 --> 01:35:08,651
Hello poorbi?

1526
01:35:09,630 --> 01:35:10,562
It's me, deepak.

1527
01:35:12,033 --> 01:35:14,194
Hello? Can you hear me?

1528
01:35:15,636 --> 01:35:18,036
Poorbi, it's me... deepak.

1529
01:35:19,206 --> 01:35:20,366
Yes, how are you?

1530
01:35:20,541 --> 01:35:22,634
How are you people? How is sir?

1531
01:35:23,511 --> 01:35:24,409
I read on the net that...

1532
01:35:25,146 --> 01:35:26,443
yes, everything is fine here.

1533
01:35:27,014 --> 01:35:28,242
Dad has taken voluntary retirement.

1534
01:35:29,016 --> 01:35:30,005
Retirement?

1535
01:35:30,584 --> 01:35:33,382
Poorbi, is everything okay?
Tell me the truth, please...

1536
01:35:34,221 --> 01:35:36,246
yes, everything is fine. And you?

1537
01:35:37,258 --> 01:35:38,282
I'm not okay at all.

1538
01:35:38,325 --> 01:35:43,092
Poorbi, since i left home,
i've been cursing myself.

1539
01:35:43,497 --> 01:35:47,934
I just failed to understand him.
I behaved so badly with him.

1540
01:35:49,103 --> 01:35:51,094
How much i hurt him!

1541
01:35:51,505 --> 01:35:53,097
I wasn't in my senses, poorbi.

1542
01:35:54,108 --> 01:35:55,370
I feel so guilty.

1543
01:35:57,344 --> 01:35:58,936
Poorbi, i want to apologise to him.

1544
01:36:01,048 --> 01:36:03,676
Poorbi, please.
I want to talk to him.

1545
01:36:04,385 --> 01:36:05,511
He's fine.

1546
01:36:06,387 --> 01:36:08,252
Deepak, i'll speak with you later, ok?

1547
01:36:08,723 --> 01:36:10,156
Poorbi, please!

1548
01:36:43,624 --> 01:36:45,993
Here, hand me the plate.

1549
01:36:45,993 --> 01:36:46,721
And that too.

1550
01:36:56,237 --> 01:36:57,261
You're back, my dear?

1551
01:36:57,471 --> 01:36:57,732
Come.

1552
01:36:59,507 --> 01:37:02,442
See, i called for your favourite food.

1553
01:37:02,777 --> 01:37:07,009
Curry tempered with cumin seeds
and missi roti.

1554
01:37:07,715 --> 01:37:09,342
This is potato...

1555
01:37:16,090 --> 01:37:17,387
i'm sorry, dad.

1556
01:37:18,025 --> 01:37:19,492
I'm really sorry.

1557
01:37:21,428 --> 01:37:23,453
I hurt you so much.

1558
01:37:27,401 --> 01:37:28,425
I was scared.

1559
01:37:30,304 --> 01:37:31,498
Very scared.

1560
01:37:51,859 --> 01:37:52,553
Dad?

1561
01:37:53,494 --> 01:37:54,483
Yes, my dear?

1562
01:37:55,863 --> 01:37:57,330
I'm starving.

1563
01:38:20,053 --> 01:38:23,113
It's very important.
I need to see the honourable secretary.

1564
01:38:23,256 --> 01:38:25,349
He isn't here right now.
What is it?

1565
01:38:25,659 --> 01:38:28,695
The intimation for my scholarship
hasn't reached padmavati institute yet.

1566
01:38:28,695 --> 01:38:30,330
And, the deadline for admissions is 4 p.m.

1567
01:38:30,330 --> 01:38:31,627
What is your name?

1568
01:38:31,665 --> 01:38:33,599
Pandit dinanath upadhyay.

1569
01:38:34,601 --> 01:38:36,193
But, your name isn't in this list.

1570
01:38:36,503 --> 01:38:37,333
Sorry?

1571
01:38:38,538 --> 01:38:40,740
That's impossible!

1572
01:38:40,740 --> 01:38:43,072
My name was there... at the top.

1573
01:38:43,643 --> 01:38:45,679
Prabhakar sir had personally
recommended my name. Please check...

1574
01:38:45,679 --> 01:38:46,737
which prabhakar sir?

1575
01:38:47,347 --> 01:38:49,082
The ex-principal of s.t. M?

1576
01:38:49,082 --> 01:38:49,741
Yes, yes...

1577
01:38:50,884 --> 01:38:52,215
go tell him...

1578
01:38:52,852 --> 01:38:55,150
to get you admitted
through some reserved quota.

1579
01:38:55,488 --> 01:38:58,514
We don't waste our scholarships on
the recommendations of people like him.

1580
01:39:05,565 --> 01:39:06,623
Please do forgive me.

1581
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:09,465
I wasn't acquainted with
your current circumstances.

1582
01:39:10,704 --> 01:39:16,336
Else, i would never have come
in your presence with my difficulty.

1583
01:39:22,649 --> 01:39:23,274
Wait, pandit.

1584
01:39:25,852 --> 01:39:26,580
You did the right thing.

1585
01:39:27,887 --> 01:39:28,512
You...

1586
01:39:29,723 --> 01:39:30,747
you... just wait.

1587
01:39:38,832 --> 01:39:42,859
An entire year of this child
will be wasted.

1588
01:39:44,504 --> 01:39:48,201
And, more than that,
he'll completely break.

1589
01:39:50,577 --> 01:39:54,343
It's because of me that
those people cancelled his scholarship.

1590
01:40:17,337 --> 01:40:18,861
Hurry up, prabhakar.

1591
01:40:19,973 --> 01:40:23,966
If he doesn't reach on time,
his admission will lapse.

1592
01:40:40,260 --> 01:40:42,490
You... i...

1593
01:40:43,496 --> 01:40:45,191
please don't...

1594
01:40:45,532 --> 01:40:48,729
young man, do not delay even a bit.

1595
01:40:49,202 --> 01:40:53,468
Go directly there, and conclude
the admission process.

1596
01:40:53,673 --> 01:40:54,935
Yes, sir.

1597
01:41:03,016 --> 01:41:04,506
All my wishes have come true, it seems.

1598
01:41:04,651 --> 01:41:06,744
Without a moment's hesitation,
he handed me the cheque.

1599
01:41:07,020 --> 01:41:10,717
With just a balance of three minutes,
i made it to the admission-window.

1600
01:41:11,324 --> 01:41:12,791
Never will i be able to repay his debt.

1601
01:41:14,327 --> 01:41:14,986
Please take one...

1602
01:41:17,831 --> 01:41:18,422
congratulations.

1603
01:41:20,300 --> 01:41:21,028
All my best... er...

1604
01:41:21,434 --> 01:41:21,991
auspicious wishes?

1605
01:41:22,368 --> 01:41:24,700
Yeah... auspicious wishes.

1606
01:41:40,520 --> 01:41:41,316
Please sit.

1607
01:41:42,956 --> 01:41:43,752
Bring two coffees, please.

1608
01:41:45,792 --> 01:41:46,724
Poorbi...

1609
01:41:47,660 --> 01:41:49,321
i cannot tell you how sorry i am.

1610
01:41:50,630 --> 01:41:52,359
I failed to understand sir.

1611
01:42:11,718 --> 01:42:12,480
Have you spoken with deepak?

1612
01:42:16,422 --> 01:42:17,787
I didn't tell him anything.

1613
01:42:19,926 --> 01:42:20,950
Didn't want him to worry.

1614
01:42:24,764 --> 01:42:28,894
I want to meet sir.
I would really like to help.

1615
01:42:31,537 --> 01:42:35,735
Thanks. But right now,
he doesn't want to meet anyone.

1616
01:43:20,086 --> 01:43:23,522
There was no need to leave
your college in america and come back for this!

1617
01:43:23,556 --> 01:43:25,258
You could've just called me.

1618
01:43:25,258 --> 01:43:29,490
How dare mithilesh singh do this to prabhakar,
the messiah of the poor!

1619
01:43:30,330 --> 01:43:32,594
Hey luttan!
Call up the college.

1620
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:35,365
Don't you worry.

1621
01:43:36,002 --> 01:43:38,197
The backward caste
holds him in very high regard.

1622
01:43:38,438 --> 01:43:41,100
If need be, we'll all
land up there in a demonstration.

1623
01:43:41,374 --> 01:43:42,033
Hello...

1624
01:43:43,376 --> 01:43:45,503
it's the principal on line, big brother.

1625
01:43:46,245 --> 01:43:46,574
Hello?

1626
01:43:46,913 --> 01:43:48,073
Greetings, mr. Leader.

1627
01:43:48,114 --> 01:43:50,048
I'm going to greet you alright.

1628
01:43:50,083 --> 01:43:52,210
When did you leave
teaching and begin bullying?

1629
01:43:53,019 --> 01:43:54,253
I'm sorry... i don't understand.

1630
01:43:54,253 --> 01:43:55,550
I can come there and explain!

1631
01:43:56,155 --> 01:43:59,283
Look here, if prabhakar sir's house
isn't vacated in 24 hours...

1632
01:43:59,659 --> 01:44:02,595
i will hang your photograph on
the wall with a garland around it.

1633
01:44:02,595 --> 01:44:04,030
Why don't you hear me out once...

1634
01:44:04,030 --> 01:44:06,362
there's nothing to be heard!

1635
01:44:06,499 --> 01:44:09,434
Sure, but why don't
you at least come here...

1636
01:44:12,939 --> 01:44:14,099
take it as vacated!

1637
01:44:21,247 --> 01:44:24,011
Please do come, mr. Bishambhar das.
You are welcome.

1638
01:44:24,050 --> 01:44:26,644
You can drop the welcomes,
mithilesh singh.

1639
01:44:26,686 --> 01:44:29,489
And drop your bullying,
and get out of our man's house.

1640
01:44:29,489 --> 01:44:31,657
You're absolutely right,
bishambhar das.

1641
01:44:31,657 --> 01:44:34,627
Now, he has become 'your' man...
dr. Prabhakar anand.

1642
01:44:34,627 --> 01:44:36,424
Oh... baburamji, you?

1643
01:44:36,763 --> 01:44:38,025
Lovely!

1644
01:44:38,531 --> 01:44:42,023
You get his cottage vacated,
he'll get your elected seat vacated!

1645
01:44:42,402 --> 01:44:44,131
Seat?! What are you saying?

1646
01:44:44,303 --> 01:44:45,292
What else?

1647
01:44:45,538 --> 01:44:50,305
You plough the land of backward caste politics,
he will harvest the gains!

1648
01:44:51,744 --> 01:44:55,305
You turned out to be even
more foolish than i realized.

1649
01:44:56,682 --> 01:44:58,513
Can't see through his game, can you?

1650
01:45:00,553 --> 01:45:03,556
By making just one statement
in support of reservation...

1651
01:45:03,556 --> 01:45:05,490
he has sidelined all of you.

1652
01:45:08,361 --> 01:45:11,125
Now watch how he becomes
the leader of the backward castes.

1653
01:45:11,464 --> 01:45:13,728
Leader? How will be become
the leader of the backward castes?

1654
01:45:14,233 --> 01:45:16,793
With the help of your retarded brain.

1655
01:45:18,671 --> 01:45:21,307
Go on, support him... do it.

1656
01:45:21,307 --> 01:45:21,739
Support?

1657
01:45:23,342 --> 01:45:24,673
Why should i support him?

1658
01:45:26,279 --> 01:45:29,715
You won't understand.
He's not a good man.

1659
01:45:32,018 --> 01:45:33,383
Thank you.

1660
01:45:35,555 --> 01:45:36,385
I get it.

1661
01:45:48,701 --> 01:45:49,497
Stop!

1662
01:46:01,547 --> 01:46:02,241
What is it?

1663
01:46:02,482 --> 01:46:03,710
I want you out of here!

1664
01:46:04,584 --> 01:46:06,176
Vacate the house? Now!

1665
01:46:07,320 --> 01:46:08,387
Vacate this house?

1666
01:46:08,387 --> 01:46:09,513
Are you the collector or what?

1667
01:46:14,794 --> 01:46:16,523
Security! Security!!

1668
01:46:16,729 --> 01:46:19,596
Security! Security!

1669
01:46:26,672 --> 01:46:30,438
You'd have been on the streets,
if prabhakar sir hadn't given you shelter.

1670
01:46:30,476 --> 01:46:34,147
What did you think?
That he'll quietly keep running to the court...

1671
01:46:34,147 --> 01:46:35,546
while you continue to harass him?

1672
01:46:35,882 --> 01:46:37,543
Get out of this place right now!

1673
01:46:37,583 --> 01:46:40,143
Sir, i've called the police.

1674
01:46:40,620 --> 01:46:42,144
Mr. Deepak is on a rampage here.

1675
01:46:42,622 --> 01:46:45,420
Let him do exactly what he wants to.

1676
01:46:45,558 --> 01:46:47,753
Just don't let him leave. Understood?

1677
01:46:53,232 --> 01:46:54,756
Mr. Digambar...

1678
01:46:56,202 --> 01:46:59,763
have you stopped doing
live coverage these days or what?

1679
01:47:16,422 --> 01:47:17,184
You!

1680
01:47:17,657 --> 01:47:18,419
Mithilesh singh.

1681
01:47:19,725 --> 01:47:22,295
You are responsible for this situation.

1682
01:47:22,295 --> 01:47:23,227
I will not spare you!

1683
01:47:23,396 --> 01:47:24,697
You don't scare me.

1684
01:47:24,697 --> 01:47:26,562
Go tell this to dr. Prabhakar anand...

1685
01:47:26,599 --> 01:47:27,395
who sent you here.

1686
01:47:27,700 --> 01:47:28,935
You rascal!

1687
01:47:28,935 --> 01:47:30,493
You think he is weak, huh?

1688
01:47:31,604 --> 01:47:33,333
This is my last warning.

1689
01:47:33,372 --> 01:47:35,533
Close your shop and get out of this place!

1690
01:47:35,608 --> 01:47:37,269
Otherwise, i'll throw you out myself!

1691
01:47:37,510 --> 01:47:37,839
Get out!

1692
01:47:40,580 --> 01:47:43,606
Did you see this?
Is this the way to behave?

1693
01:47:44,684 --> 01:47:47,585
We're running this coaching centre
in a legal and peaceful manner.

1694
01:47:47,887 --> 01:47:49,616
And prabhakar anand
sends his his thugs here.

1695
01:47:50,156 --> 01:47:51,623
Who're you calling a thug?

1696
01:47:51,824 --> 01:47:53,155
See, see...

1697
01:47:53,593 --> 01:47:54,389
- you thug!

1698
01:47:54,594 --> 01:47:55,583
- See for yourself.

1699
01:47:55,928 --> 01:47:58,590
- See for yourself.

1700
01:47:59,232 --> 01:48:01,367
See the level to which they have stooped.

1701
01:48:01,367 --> 01:48:03,460
Sir, what action will you take against this?

1702
01:48:04,503 --> 01:48:06,494
I'm... i'm totally shocked.

1703
01:48:07,607 --> 01:48:11,244
According to me,
there's only one place for such people.

1704
01:48:11,244 --> 01:48:11,642
Jail!

1705
01:48:12,511 --> 01:48:15,181
The owner of k.k. Coaching centre
alleges that...

1706
01:48:15,181 --> 01:48:19,352
it is on prabhakar anand's orders
that deepak kumar attacked them.

1707
01:48:19,352 --> 01:48:21,454
The police have arrested deepak kumar.

1708
01:48:21,454 --> 01:48:23,623
- He got into a fight with mithilesh singh.

1709
01:48:23,623 --> 01:48:26,421
- Mithilesh singh is in a shock
since the incident.

1710
01:48:28,261 --> 01:48:29,319
Are you dr. Prabhakar anand?

1711
01:48:29,929 --> 01:48:31,264
Yes, that's me.

1712
01:48:31,264 --> 01:48:32,822
You've been summoned
to the police station.

1713
01:48:32,999 --> 01:48:34,557
He was right here!
What has he?

1714
01:48:34,600 --> 01:48:35,862
Kavita, please.

1715
01:48:36,736 --> 01:48:37,532
Let's go.

1716
01:48:37,570 --> 01:48:38,332
I'm coming with you!

1717
01:48:38,371 --> 01:48:38,632
No, both of you stay here.

1718
01:48:45,778 --> 01:48:47,336
Dr. Anand what are you charged with?

1719
01:48:47,380 --> 01:48:48,847
Did you send hooligans there?

1720
01:48:49,282 --> 01:48:50,683
What is your relationship
with deepak kumar?

1721
01:48:50,683 --> 01:48:52,674
Are you taking revenge on mithilesh kumar?

1722
01:48:52,918 --> 01:48:56,410
Dr. Anand, first a principal,
then a convict - how do you feel?

1723
01:49:05,498 --> 01:49:07,125
- Sign your 'horoscope'!

1724
01:49:07,500 --> 01:49:10,162
- Attack k.k. Coaching, will you?
Sign this!

1725
01:49:11,037 --> 01:49:12,436
Take him inside!

1726
01:49:17,610 --> 01:49:18,474
I am sorry, sir.

1727
01:49:20,212 --> 01:49:21,839
Welcome principal sir.

1728
01:49:23,416 --> 01:49:25,213
You seem like a reasonable gentleman.

1729
01:49:25,685 --> 01:49:28,449
That is why i had
explained to you with such respect.

1730
01:49:29,221 --> 01:49:30,813
Even hired a lawyer for you.

1731
01:49:31,123 --> 01:49:34,684
But you? You resorted
to using a cheap thug!

1732
01:49:35,428 --> 01:49:36,156
Sheesh!

1733
01:49:37,163 --> 01:49:38,425
I didn't expect this from you.

1734
01:49:38,497 --> 01:49:41,500
Inspector, please!
Sir didn't know anything about this.

1735
01:49:41,500 --> 01:49:44,833
Hey, if you act smart,
i'll shove this all the way in!

1736
01:49:48,074 --> 01:49:51,669
You think the law is blindfolded, do you?

1737
01:49:52,278 --> 01:49:55,381
This guy will be locked
up under sections 326 and 452.

1738
01:49:55,381 --> 01:49:58,818
Under criminal conspiracy section 120-b,
should i haul you in too?

1739
01:49:58,818 --> 01:50:03,221
Lt'll make no difference to him,
inspector thakur. No difference at all!

1740
01:50:05,091 --> 01:50:06,854
He's sold his self-respect.

1741
01:50:07,526 --> 01:50:10,689
Otherwise, he wouldn't have been
kicked out of s.t.m. In this way.

1742
01:50:12,465 --> 01:50:15,298
He's done a doctorate in hypocrisy!

1743
01:50:16,102 --> 01:50:18,332
He has been unmasked.

1744
01:50:19,105 --> 01:50:21,173
Total fake teacher!

1745
01:50:21,173 --> 01:50:24,310
Hey mithilesh singh!
One more word about sir and...

1746
01:50:24,310 --> 01:50:27,677
see that?
See the students that he's trained?

1747
01:50:28,681 --> 01:50:31,707
For 35 years, he weaved a
web of deceit with mathematics.

1748
01:50:32,385 --> 01:50:33,784
Now, the result is out!

1749
01:50:34,820 --> 01:50:38,483
Sir, you were a zero,
you are a zero...

1750
01:50:38,624 --> 01:50:41,889
and you'll always remain a...

1751
01:50:42,695 --> 01:50:43,593
zero.

1752
01:50:43,896 --> 01:50:46,232
Mithilesh sir, what should we do with him?

1753
01:50:46,232 --> 01:50:48,257
There's no need to do anything.

1754
01:50:52,405 --> 01:50:56,273
You set out to serve a
'show cause' notice to k.k. Coaching?

1755
01:50:56,809 --> 01:50:59,903
It is the future of india's education.

1756
01:51:00,613 --> 01:51:03,275
There's no room for teachers like you!

1757
01:51:04,350 --> 01:51:06,716
Dr. Prabhakar anand, you are...

1758
01:51:08,621 --> 01:51:09,679
dismissed!

1759
01:51:54,733 --> 01:51:56,462
Sir...

1760
01:52:06,445 --> 01:52:08,777
but, i'm enquiring
about dr. Prabhakar anand.

1761
01:52:09,348 --> 01:52:10,212
What happened?

1762
01:52:10,850 --> 01:52:11,544
What happened, poorbi?

1763
01:52:11,584 --> 01:52:12,551
They hung up!

1764
01:52:12,551 --> 01:52:14,053
What did they say?
Where is he?

1765
01:52:14,053 --> 01:52:14,781
They said nothing, mom.

1766
01:52:17,690 --> 01:52:19,282
Ok, i will come tomorrow morning.

1767
01:52:22,294 --> 01:52:23,625
What did they do with dad?

1768
01:52:23,762 --> 01:52:25,598
They haven't charged him with anything.

1769
01:52:25,598 --> 01:52:27,065
- So, then?
- Then, where is he?

1770
01:52:27,533 --> 01:52:28,734
He left before i got here.

1771
01:52:28,734 --> 01:52:29,860
And deepak?

1772
01:52:30,703 --> 01:52:31,727
Where could he have gone?

1773
01:52:38,777 --> 01:52:41,075
What have i done!

1774
01:52:42,348 --> 01:52:44,077
I can never forgive myself.

1775
01:53:05,838 --> 01:53:10,175
- Shambhu, there's someone at the gate.

1776
01:53:10,175 --> 01:53:11,472
- Then, open it!

1777
01:53:20,786 --> 01:53:22,515
Guruji? You... here?

1778
01:53:23,622 --> 01:53:25,681
Shambhu, i need your help.

1779
01:53:29,528 --> 01:53:30,586
Please come.

1780
01:53:32,598 --> 01:53:34,733
Yes, this is hotel surendra vilas.

1781
01:53:34,733 --> 01:53:36,502
Please can i speak with poorbi.

1782
01:53:36,502 --> 01:53:37,196
Yes...

1783
01:53:37,469 --> 01:53:38,868
they just walked in.

1784
01:53:38,904 --> 01:53:41,668
Excuse me, ma'am...
some shambhu yadav on the line for you.

1785
01:53:42,408 --> 01:53:43,272
Shambhu?

1786
01:53:43,909 --> 01:53:44,398
Hello?

1787
01:53:44,543 --> 01:53:46,946
- Shambhu speaking... the stable owner.

1788
01:53:46,946 --> 01:53:48,470
- Guruji is here at my place.

1789
01:53:49,214 --> 01:53:52,479
- And he has asked you to come here.
Please come here.

1790
01:53:53,652 --> 01:53:55,142
Poorbi... what?

1791
01:53:57,256 --> 01:53:58,280
What happened?

1792
01:53:58,824 --> 01:54:00,155
Dad has called us.

1793
01:54:09,602 --> 01:54:10,261
Greetings.

1794
01:54:10,569 --> 01:54:11,870
Hey you!
Take the luggage - quick.

1795
01:54:11,870 --> 01:54:13,172
Where is he?

1796
01:54:13,172 --> 01:54:14,332
There...

1797
01:54:15,908 --> 01:54:19,435
he's at it.
Guruji... you know...

1798
01:54:19,745 --> 01:54:25,274
x is equal to y to the power a,
is equal to z to the power b to the power a...

1799
01:54:25,317 --> 01:54:28,354
is equal to z to the power ab,

1800
01:54:28,354 --> 01:54:32,757
is equal to x to the power c to the power ab,

1801
01:54:32,791 --> 01:54:35,294
is equal to x to the power abc...

1802
01:54:35,294 --> 01:54:38,998
therefore, abc = 1.

1803
01:54:38,998 --> 01:54:40,795
Q.e.d.

1804
01:54:41,400 --> 01:54:43,630
That was quite easily done!

1805
01:54:46,438 --> 01:54:48,633
Okay, go now.
Get ready for school.

1806
01:54:48,741 --> 01:54:50,436
Next class this evening.

1807
01:54:50,476 --> 01:54:50,908
Go now.

1808
01:55:11,530 --> 01:55:13,088
Guruji, your tea.

1809
01:55:16,168 --> 01:55:17,692
Shall i say something, guruji?

1810
01:55:19,071 --> 01:55:24,566
I've never seen my muniya
actually laugh while studying.

1811
01:55:30,315 --> 01:55:34,453
Shambhu, there must be
other children around here...

1812
01:55:34,453 --> 01:55:36,944
in 10th and 12th grades?

1813
01:55:38,090 --> 01:55:40,684
Of course!
There are a lot, guruji.

1814
01:55:40,726 --> 01:55:42,591
There's a settlement over here.

1815
01:55:45,731 --> 01:55:46,959
Gather them.

1816
01:55:48,567 --> 01:55:50,159
No matter which society they come from.

1817
01:55:51,603 --> 01:55:52,968
I'll will teach them.

1818
01:55:55,307 --> 01:55:56,239
Free of cost.

1819
01:56:10,689 --> 01:56:13,351
Prabhakar, i want my house back.

1820
01:56:14,326 --> 01:56:19,161
Where have you brought us?
And what is this you've started?

1821
01:56:21,767 --> 01:56:23,792
We will reclaim our house.

1822
01:56:25,003 --> 01:56:26,231
And everything else...

1823
01:56:28,006 --> 01:56:31,442
self-respect, reputation
and all those values that...

1824
01:56:31,477 --> 01:56:37,143
i lived by, as a teacher.
All of it!

1825
01:56:37,816 --> 01:56:43,015
These petty traders of
education cannot terrorise us!

1826
01:56:45,257 --> 01:56:47,350
I will wipe them out!

1827
01:56:47,986 --> 01:56:48,918
Excellent!

1828
01:56:50,055 --> 01:56:51,784
The collections are good this time.

1829
01:56:51,823 --> 01:56:54,189
But, henceforth collect
the entire fees in advance.

1830
01:56:54,693 --> 01:56:59,858
If you continue to run this centre like this,
i'll extend your contract to five years.

1831
01:57:00,232 --> 01:57:01,028
But, sir...

1832
01:57:01,199 --> 01:57:02,768
prabhakar uncle had said two years...

1833
01:57:02,768 --> 01:57:04,668
it's a civil case!

1834
01:57:04,903 --> 01:57:07,167
He'll be running to
the court for 20-25 years.

1835
01:57:07,639 --> 01:57:10,938
I hear he lives in the stable now
with his family.

1836
01:57:11,710 --> 01:57:14,110
Does he want
reservation for buffaloes now?

1837
01:57:14,646 --> 01:57:16,910
No, sir. A few students from
the neighbourhood slum go to him.

1838
01:57:17,149 --> 01:57:19,049
What else can he do?

1839
01:57:19,084 --> 01:57:21,211
After all, he has to
pay rent to shambhu!

1840
01:57:26,858 --> 01:57:29,019
Yes, what is it?

1841
01:57:29,795 --> 01:57:31,695
I have deepak kumar's bail papers.

1842
01:57:32,631 --> 01:57:33,928
His bail has been granted.

1843
01:57:36,134 --> 01:57:36,998
Hey...

1844
01:57:38,370 --> 01:57:40,065
let that 'hero' go.

1845
01:57:43,775 --> 01:57:45,675
Come with me, mr. Advocate.

1846
01:57:51,349 --> 01:57:52,976
Get a grip, fellow.

1847
01:57:53,585 --> 01:57:55,746
This hooliganism won't be
tolerated here.

1848
01:57:59,224 --> 01:58:01,692
Here, please sign this.

1849
01:58:06,198 --> 01:58:09,031
Thanks, mr. Advocate.
But, who got the bail done?

1850
01:58:59,551 --> 01:59:02,884
For a maximum product of q into q minus q...

1851
01:59:03,421 --> 01:59:06,288
both parts must be the same. Therefore...

1852
01:59:09,361 --> 01:59:13,297
q divided by q is equal to 2.

1853
01:59:17,435 --> 01:59:18,834
What is it, muniya?

1854
01:59:21,406 --> 01:59:23,340
Sir... i won't study.

1855
01:59:24,943 --> 01:59:25,932
Why not?

1856
01:59:29,181 --> 01:59:32,150
Sir, the principal has issued a warning...

1857
01:59:32,150 --> 01:59:34,419
that no one who scores
below 65% in the preliminaries...

1858
01:59:34,419 --> 01:59:36,751
will be allowed to take the final exams.

1859
01:59:36,888 --> 01:59:39,857
And sir, i've never scored above 57%.

1860
01:59:40,959 --> 01:59:41,983
When is your pre-board?

1861
01:59:42,194 --> 01:59:42,455
Sorry?

1862
01:59:42,894 --> 01:59:43,792
From the 23rd, sir.

1863
01:59:44,029 --> 01:59:46,998
23rd. We have two weeks!

1864
01:59:48,200 --> 01:59:51,363
Why won't you score 65%, then?
We'll make it happen!

1865
01:59:54,206 --> 01:59:55,833
You will work hard, won't you?

1866
01:59:57,309 --> 01:59:58,105
- Will you?
- Yes.

1867
01:59:58,143 --> 01:59:59,667
Then you will get a 65%!

1868
02:00:05,016 --> 02:00:06,418
So, as i was saying...

1869
02:00:06,418 --> 02:00:10,252
a charge q is divided
into two parts of q and q minus q.

1870
02:00:11,022 --> 02:00:12,390
If the coulomb...

1871
02:00:12,390 --> 02:00:14,449
- sushant and deepak want to meet you.

1872
02:00:14,759 --> 02:00:17,057
Repulsion between them
when they are separated...

1873
02:00:17,429 --> 02:00:18,293
dad, please!

1874
02:00:19,764 --> 02:00:20,788
Even they want to help.

1875
02:00:24,970 --> 02:00:27,165
I don't need anybody's help.
Thank you.

1876
02:00:30,375 --> 02:00:32,866
Then the ratio of q/q should be...

1877
02:00:32,911 --> 02:00:36,438
(a) 2, (b) 1/2

1878
02:00:36,481 --> 02:00:40,941
(c) 4 or (d) 1/4

1879
02:00:41,019 --> 02:00:45,479
as i was saying,
a charged q is divided into two parts...

1880
02:01:07,512 --> 02:01:11,209
it's 3 a.m.
Where are you going at this hour?

1881
02:01:11,950 --> 02:01:13,417
I have to help them revise.

1882
02:01:14,519 --> 02:01:16,885
They have a math exam today.

1883
02:01:40,111 --> 02:01:40,941
Guruji...

1884
02:01:41,413 --> 02:01:42,505
so, the revision is going on...

1885
02:01:43,214 --> 02:01:43,908
yes, sir.

1886
02:01:44,983 --> 02:01:46,883
So, where have we got stuck?

1887
02:01:48,119 --> 02:01:49,279
See...

1888
02:01:49,888 --> 02:01:53,558
minus 2k squared
cancels out plus 2k squared.

1889
02:01:53,558 --> 02:01:54,889
Yes, of course!

1890
02:02:02,267 --> 02:02:02,961
Greetings madam.

1891
02:02:03,001 --> 02:02:03,558
Greetings.

1892
02:02:04,469 --> 02:02:05,868
Is... everything okay?

1893
02:02:05,904 --> 02:02:07,337
Yes, yes. Everything's fine.

1894
02:02:13,178 --> 02:02:15,043
This is dr. Prabhakar anand!

1895
02:02:15,080 --> 02:02:17,605
Yes, it is he who teaches
all the students here.

1896
02:02:18,283 --> 02:02:20,615
Our principal has come to meet you.

1897
02:02:23,221 --> 02:02:24,051
Greetings, sir.

1898
02:02:24,356 --> 02:02:26,620
Greetings. What brings you here?

1899
02:02:27,325 --> 02:02:30,954
Your student, muniya,
has done what we haven't ever seen earlier.

1900
02:02:31,496 --> 02:02:35,330
The student who would score 50-57%
earlier has scored a 76% in the preliminary exam!

1901
02:02:36,001 --> 02:02:37,093
What?!! Really?

1902
02:02:37,268 --> 02:02:38,292
Only you could have done this, sir!

1903
02:02:38,536 --> 02:02:41,973
She will do even better in
the board exams. Right, muniya?

1904
02:02:41,973 --> 02:02:43,008
I'll score more than 80%!

1905
02:02:43,008 --> 02:02:44,635
More than 80...

1906
02:02:45,543 --> 02:02:46,845
my muniya!!

1907
02:02:46,845 --> 02:02:48,146
Please serve tea!

1908
02:02:48,146 --> 02:02:50,273
I'll... i'll get some sweets.

1909
02:02:51,082 --> 02:02:53,107
- What's the matter?

1910
02:02:53,251 --> 02:02:55,446
I've stood first in my class!

1911
02:02:57,088 --> 02:03:00,080
Many of our students
take private tuitions and coaching.

1912
02:03:00,525 --> 02:03:01,082
At k.k. Too.

1913
02:03:02,193 --> 02:03:04,184
But, this time,
muniya has beaten everyone.

1914
02:03:04,429 --> 02:03:07,592
Now all the parents are
inquiring about muniya's coaching school.

1915
02:03:07,999 --> 02:03:11,230
Stable school!
Anyone who wishes to study can join.

1916
02:03:12,470 --> 02:03:13,872
Refund our fees.

1917
02:03:13,872 --> 02:03:14,600
We don't want our children to study here.

1918
02:03:14,639 --> 02:03:17,199
Sir, please...
tej, just attend to them.

1919
02:03:19,077 --> 02:03:19,441
Hello sir?

1920
02:03:19,944 --> 02:03:21,138
What is going on here, sunny?

1921
02:03:21,613 --> 02:03:23,248
The number of students
has reduced to half this month!

1922
02:03:23,248 --> 02:03:24,549
Admissions are still going on.

1923
02:03:24,549 --> 02:03:28,319
A group of 20 is coming to join today.
Perhaps a little publicity...

1924
02:03:28,319 --> 02:03:29,081
- publicity?!

1925
02:03:30,188 --> 02:03:32,486
Since when did k.k. Coaching
begin needing publicity?

1926
02:03:44,335 --> 02:03:45,700
What is this, tej prasad?

1927
02:03:45,904 --> 02:03:49,533
Sir, i've already spoken with them about it.
In a few days some more students...

1928
02:03:51,709 --> 02:03:53,370
sir, in a day or two...

1929
02:03:55,914 --> 02:03:56,903
what's this?

1930
02:04:07,325 --> 02:04:08,087
Where are these people going?

1931
02:04:08,326 --> 02:04:12,023
Sir, uh... in the stable opposite...
coaching classes are being held.

1932
02:04:12,130 --> 02:04:13,427
These are kids from gandhi nagar, sir.

1933
02:04:13,932 --> 02:04:15,695
Sushant seth has
arranged a bus service for them.

1934
02:04:21,573 --> 02:04:22,437
Really?!

1935
02:04:24,209 --> 02:04:26,040
Looks like his farce has begun to work.

1936
02:04:48,733 --> 02:04:51,224
If your notes are ready,
please give them to me.

1937
02:04:51,269 --> 02:04:52,759
I'll get photocopies made.

1938
02:04:53,171 --> 02:04:54,900
Now, there are more
than 70 students in the stable now.

1939
02:04:58,476 --> 02:04:59,465
Mrs. Dey?

1940
02:05:00,411 --> 02:05:02,046
Forgive me, dinkarji.

1941
02:05:02,046 --> 02:05:03,035
I won't be able to come any longer.

1942
02:05:04,015 --> 02:05:06,347
Sir, the principal has summoned you.

1943
02:05:09,954 --> 02:05:11,319
Come... have a seat.

1944
02:05:13,324 --> 02:05:15,417
You seem to be putting in
a lot of extra hours at the stable.

1945
02:05:16,294 --> 02:05:18,091
You guys are minting good money, eh?

1946
02:05:19,998 --> 02:05:21,397
I offer my services there for free.

1947
02:05:21,799 --> 02:05:22,800
But why?!

1948
02:05:22,800 --> 02:05:27,362
Mr. Dinkar, why are you throwing away
your hard-earned knowledge into a dustbin?

1949
02:05:27,705 --> 02:05:30,469
Join our k.k. Coaching.
Your talent will be rewarded there.

1950
02:05:31,342 --> 02:05:33,003
100,000 rupees a month!

1951
02:05:35,246 --> 02:05:38,272
Mr. Mithilesh, i am devoted
to the principles of prabhakarji.

1952
02:05:40,385 --> 02:05:41,784
You can't buy me.

1953
02:05:42,887 --> 02:05:46,015
Fine, fine... please sit.
What's the hurry?

1954
02:05:46,257 --> 02:05:48,960
You've rejected my offer.
No problem.

1955
02:05:48,960 --> 02:05:50,359
Please take this new time-table with you.

1956
02:05:50,862 --> 02:05:52,727
You are in big demand
among the students.

1957
02:05:53,164 --> 02:05:55,400
So, two classes in the morning...
two in the evening.

1958
02:05:55,400 --> 02:05:57,027
Four extra classes everyday.

1959
02:05:58,403 --> 02:05:59,870
But, this is blatantly unjust!

1960
02:06:00,538 --> 02:06:02,972
I... i... i won't be able to do this.

1961
02:06:03,975 --> 02:06:08,746
Dinkarji, if you don't follow
these instructions...

1962
02:06:08,746 --> 02:06:11,977
i'll be forced to
take disciplinary action.

1963
02:06:13,351 --> 02:06:16,154
The bank guarantee that
s.t.m. Has taken for your house mortgage...

1964
02:06:16,154 --> 02:06:17,314
will have to be withdrawn.

1965
02:06:18,823 --> 02:06:20,347
As for yourjob, well...

1966
02:06:21,459 --> 02:06:24,758
mr. Ex-vice principal...

1967
02:06:26,898 --> 02:06:28,490
you have no other option.

1968
02:06:29,767 --> 02:06:31,359
Your house could get auctioned.

1969
02:06:32,337 --> 02:06:34,931
Then, perhaps you too will
have to seek shelter in that stable.

1970
02:06:41,779 --> 02:06:43,337
See you in the class.

1971
02:06:49,387 --> 02:06:51,514
Namaste, dinkar, you're early today.

1972
02:06:56,027 --> 02:06:56,857
What's wrong?

1973
02:06:59,998 --> 02:07:02,432
Sir, i'm resigning from s.t.m.

1974
02:07:03,434 --> 02:07:08,804
Sir, mithilesh singh has lured
the other teachers away with money.

1975
02:07:09,374 --> 02:07:10,807
He tried the same with me too.

1976
02:07:11,876 --> 02:07:13,070
Sir, i can't take it anymore.

1977
02:07:13,111 --> 02:07:14,100
Sir, i'm leaving this job.

1978
02:07:14,479 --> 02:07:16,276
No, dinkar.
You will do nothing of the sort.

1979
02:07:16,814 --> 02:07:18,577
I know you have
your responsibilities.

1980
02:07:18,616 --> 02:07:21,085
But, you're alone, sir!
Sir, this job isn't...

1981
02:07:21,085 --> 02:07:24,384
don't worry about me.
I will manage. Ok?

1982
02:07:33,631 --> 02:07:37,192
Come, come on, here all of you.

1983
02:07:39,971 --> 02:07:42,307
Come... come with me...

1984
02:07:42,307 --> 02:07:44,342
it's like this.

1985
02:07:44,342 --> 02:07:48,836
The other teachers
won't be able to come now.

1986
02:07:49,547 --> 02:07:54,118
So, those of you who can come
in the afternoon, be here at 3 p.m.

1987
02:07:54,118 --> 02:07:57,849
And those who can make it
in the evening, come at 7 p.m.

1988
02:07:58,222 --> 02:08:00,213
I will take three sessions. Daily.

1989
02:08:00,358 --> 02:08:01,188
Pseudopodia.

1990
02:08:01,859 --> 02:08:04,987
The parental body itself
functions as the reproductive unit.

1991
02:08:05,029 --> 02:08:07,965
The unicellular parent organism
divides itself into two parts.

1992
02:08:07,965 --> 02:08:12,595
...1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1 within brackets.

1993
02:08:13,471 --> 02:08:14,165
Now...

1994
02:08:15,173 --> 02:08:17,869
obtain the universe of the following matrix...

1995
02:08:18,242 --> 02:08:20,608
using... elementary proportions.

1996
02:08:21,112 --> 02:08:21,942
And...

1997
02:08:27,585 --> 02:08:30,315
i'll be back in a minute.
Finish the diagrams.

1998
02:08:47,004 --> 02:08:50,440
Dad, please rest for a while.

1999
02:08:50,575 --> 02:08:51,940
No, i'm okay, my dear.

2000
02:08:52,510 --> 02:08:54,171
I have to complete their lesson today.

2001
02:08:54,345 --> 02:08:56,006
Please, dad... just for a little while.

2002
02:08:56,681 --> 02:08:58,615
You worry a lot about me.

2003
02:08:59,484 --> 02:09:01,645
Okay then,
please get me a cup of tea.

2004
02:09:03,955 --> 02:09:04,444
Okay.

2005
02:09:04,956 --> 02:09:05,752
Thank you.

2006
02:09:16,134 --> 02:09:18,227
Okay, settle down,
settle down... alright?

2007
02:09:19,170 --> 02:09:19,727
Let's start.

2008
02:09:28,379 --> 02:09:30,643
Dad, sit still for a minute at least!

2009
02:09:31,516 --> 02:09:36,421
I gave them a test.
I have to check the answers.

2010
02:09:36,421 --> 02:09:38,514
Just what are you
trying to do, prabhakar?

2011
02:09:38,689 --> 02:09:41,590
How long are you
going to do all this alone?

2012
02:09:42,260 --> 02:09:43,522
What if something happens to you?

2013
02:09:48,733 --> 02:09:51,327
Well, anything can happen
at anytime, kavita.

2014
02:09:52,737 --> 02:09:55,205
But, the path that
i have chosen to walk on...

2015
02:09:56,541 --> 02:09:58,372
i am not going to stop.

2016
02:09:59,610 --> 02:10:02,374
Even if i have to
walk alone all the way.

2017
02:10:10,154 --> 02:10:13,646
Hariya, come...
have some sweets. Good!

2018
02:10:14,358 --> 02:10:17,020
Deepak, here have some sweets.

2019
02:10:18,029 --> 02:10:20,156
I had organised a prayer
for lord satyanarayan.

2020
02:10:20,665 --> 02:10:23,793
There are only 30 days to go
for muniya's board exams.

2021
02:10:24,135 --> 02:10:25,837
Suraj, please distribute these sweets.

2022
02:10:25,837 --> 02:10:26,769
To everyone!

2023
02:10:28,706 --> 02:10:29,331
So...

2024
02:10:30,141 --> 02:10:31,039
how is sir?

2025
02:10:32,410 --> 02:10:34,846
Obsessed by the same desire.

2026
02:10:34,846 --> 02:10:37,610
From 5 a.m. Until late at night...

2027
02:10:37,648 --> 02:10:38,816
he's at it for the kids.

2028
02:10:38,816 --> 02:10:43,150
There's poorbi and kavita who help.

2029
02:10:44,188 --> 02:10:46,190
But he really has no
breathing space at all.

2030
02:10:46,190 --> 02:10:47,425
We get double benefits.

2031
02:10:47,425 --> 02:10:50,553
Guruji teaches us in day
and here deepak guides us at night.

2032
02:10:52,063 --> 02:10:54,156
If only you were with him...

2033
02:10:54,565 --> 02:10:56,396
he would've had some support.

2034
02:10:57,768 --> 02:11:00,638
27 students from our neighbourhood
attend sir's morning class.

2035
02:11:00,638 --> 02:11:02,503
That's all very well, deepak.

2036
02:11:02,540 --> 02:11:04,375
But with more students coming in...

2037
02:11:04,375 --> 02:11:05,433
and guruji being alone...

2038
02:11:14,113 --> 02:11:18,709
a upon x+4 plus b upon x+7

2039
02:11:18,751 --> 02:11:22,454
and to find the value of the
constants a and b, we will assume...

2040
02:11:22,454 --> 02:11:25,355
x + 4 is equal 0

2041
02:11:25,391 --> 02:11:29,418
which means that x is equal to - 4

2042
02:11:34,433 --> 02:11:35,764
- namaskar.
- Namaste.

2043
02:11:36,702 --> 02:11:39,170
Sir, our kids want to join your class.

2044
02:11:40,105 --> 02:11:43,233
Both of these go to k.k. Coaching but
now want to come to your class.

2045
02:11:44,109 --> 02:11:47,340
My sons, shiv and om are already with you.

2046
02:11:47,513 --> 02:11:49,674
Seeing their improvement,
these people have also come.

2047
02:11:52,051 --> 02:11:54,053
Any student who wishes
to study is welcome here.

2048
02:11:54,053 --> 02:11:55,421
You can definitely send them.

2049
02:11:55,421 --> 02:11:57,355
But, sir, we had one request.

2050
02:11:57,389 --> 02:11:59,584
Please teach our kids separately.

2051
02:12:00,292 --> 02:12:02,726
Many people want
to send their kids to you.

2052
02:12:02,795 --> 02:12:05,831
If you wish, we can even give
you a separate place.

2053
02:12:05,831 --> 02:12:09,062
We are willing to
pay any fee that you ask.

2054
02:12:09,368 --> 02:12:13,405
The only thing is...
sitting near them is a problem.

2055
02:12:13,405 --> 02:12:15,202
These kids are...

2056
02:12:15,574 --> 02:12:16,700
you understand, don't you?

2057
02:12:17,076 --> 02:12:19,244
I mean... they don't even bathe.

2058
02:12:19,244 --> 02:12:21,405
Being with them will
ruin our children's culture.

2059
02:12:22,748 --> 02:12:25,808
There's a stench that comes
from your thoughts, in fact.

2060
02:12:26,819 --> 02:12:28,878
Your views are disgusting.

2061
02:12:30,222 --> 02:12:31,712
For me, all children are equal.

2062
02:12:33,225 --> 02:12:36,562
I will teach them together,
in one class.

2063
02:12:36,562 --> 02:12:37,654
If anyone wants to leave, he can.

2064
02:12:39,098 --> 02:12:41,467
And now, if you'll excuse me,
may i get back to my class?

2065
02:12:41,467 --> 02:12:43,560
We were talking about your benefit.

2066
02:12:43,702 --> 02:12:46,638
There, at k.k. Coaching,
mithileshji has brought in 10 teachers...

2067
02:12:46,638 --> 02:12:48,469
from delhi who're paid
200,000 a month.

2068
02:12:48,540 --> 02:12:50,175
He has also reduced the fees.

2069
02:12:50,175 --> 02:12:51,767
Who wants to send their kids to you?

2070
02:12:52,511 --> 02:12:52,875
Let's go!

2071
02:12:53,645 --> 02:12:55,237
Shiv! Om! Come on home.

2072
02:12:55,614 --> 02:12:57,479
From tomorrow, you'll study at k.k.

2073
02:12:57,516 --> 02:12:58,448
C'mon... c'mon!

2074
02:13:00,319 --> 02:13:00,876
Come on.

2075
02:13:03,789 --> 02:13:04,881
Right now.

2076
02:13:07,192 --> 02:13:10,320
So, if we have to find the value.

2077
02:13:10,529 --> 02:13:12,793
Of a and b, let us assume...

2078
02:13:13,799 --> 02:13:15,630
let us assume that...

2079
02:13:16,635 --> 02:13:19,661
x+4 is equal to 0

2080
02:13:20,139 --> 02:13:20,833
therefore...

2081
02:13:21,340 --> 02:13:23,501
x is equal to - 4

2082
02:13:23,776 --> 02:13:24,470
now...

2083
02:13:25,544 --> 02:13:26,945
how do we factor this?

2084
02:13:26,945 --> 02:13:30,244
Sir, x+7 is equal to 0 i.e. X is equal to - 7

2085
02:13:30,682 --> 02:13:32,445
now put this value in f of x

2086
02:13:32,718 --> 02:13:35,881
sir, except at x + 7 i.e. In the denominator

2087
02:13:36,722 --> 02:13:37,689
correct!

2088
02:13:38,924 --> 02:13:39,822
Sir, 2 by 3.

2089
02:13:43,562 --> 02:13:44,654
Now...

2090
02:13:45,864 --> 02:13:48,731
if z is a complex number then...

2091
02:13:50,502 --> 02:13:55,641
what does mod z = 1,
represent geometrically?

2092
02:13:55,641 --> 02:13:57,309
Sir, it represents a circle.

2093
02:13:57,309 --> 02:13:59,743
It's origin will be at the centre
and radius will be one.

2094
02:14:08,854 --> 02:14:11,345
Mass of hardness of a substance...

2095
02:14:11,390 --> 02:14:14,827
multiplied by multiplication factor,
how much is it friends?

2096
02:14:14,827 --> 02:14:15,828
Eighty one...

2097
02:14:15,828 --> 02:14:17,496
so today's question is to find...

2098
02:14:17,496 --> 02:14:21,300
the resistance of the circuit
va is equal to vb, vb is equal to vc...

2099
02:14:21,300 --> 02:14:22,631
always remember...

2100
02:14:22,668 --> 02:14:25,204
in the exam,
read the questions twice...

2101
02:14:25,204 --> 02:14:26,694
or even thrice, ok?

2102
02:14:27,539 --> 02:14:29,875
The answer always lies within the question.

2103
02:14:29,875 --> 02:14:33,402
We answered prabhakar sir's question
as soon as he wrote it on the board.

2104
02:14:33,679 --> 02:14:34,509
Really?

2105
02:14:35,447 --> 02:14:36,004
What did he say?

2106
02:14:36,582 --> 02:14:37,640
Nothing, he merely praised us.

2107
02:15:44,783 --> 02:15:50,380
I knew that no one else
could sabotage my class like this.

2108
02:15:50,856 --> 02:15:51,720
Sir...

2109
02:15:53,558 --> 02:15:55,549
sir, we never meant to.

2110
02:15:56,395 --> 02:15:57,384
We were just...

2111
02:15:58,263 --> 02:16:01,366
sir, whatever punishment
you want to give us...

2112
02:16:01,366 --> 02:16:02,731
we will happily accept it.

2113
02:16:04,403 --> 02:16:07,634
But, please forgive us, sir.

2114
02:16:08,774 --> 02:16:09,638
That will happen.

2115
02:16:11,610 --> 02:16:12,872
You will certainly be punished.

2116
02:16:16,982 --> 02:16:19,177
From tomorrow,
you will hold your classes...

2117
02:16:21,386 --> 02:16:22,614
together with mine.

2118
02:16:45,744 --> 02:16:47,974
Tearing walls down

2119
02:16:50,549 --> 02:16:52,710
breaking new ground

2120
02:16:54,953 --> 02:16:56,853
is this light

2121
02:16:59,524 --> 02:17:03,551
leaving behind shackles that held it tight

2122
02:17:04,529 --> 02:17:08,397
the darkness will surround you

2123
02:17:09,001 --> 02:17:11,731
make it your ink pot

2124
02:17:13,238 --> 02:17:16,230
and script a brand new day

2125
02:17:17,642 --> 02:17:21,578
smash the locks, let the sun shine

2126
02:17:22,447 --> 02:17:26,907
hold the light in your hands, make it thine

2127
02:17:27,352 --> 02:17:31,686
break the wells, the river will flow

2128
02:17:31,790 --> 02:17:35,783
inhale it, share it, let it glow

2129
02:17:36,361 --> 02:17:37,055
it's the light

2130
02:17:37,262 --> 02:17:37,785
it belongs to everyone

2131
02:17:39,364 --> 02:17:40,729
it's shining bright

2132
02:17:41,533 --> 02:17:43,262
it belongs to everyone

2133
02:17:44,002 --> 02:17:45,526
it's shining bright

2134
02:17:45,871 --> 02:17:48,431
it's shining bright all around

2135
02:17:57,816 --> 02:17:58,646
mr. Principal...

2136
02:17:59,084 --> 02:18:01,416
i am going to teach with prabhakarji.

2137
02:18:02,454 --> 02:18:04,752
Do what you can.

2138
02:18:18,603 --> 02:18:20,935
May there be paths for everyone

2139
02:18:20,972 --> 02:18:22,872
lined with hope on either side

2140
02:18:22,908 --> 02:18:27,368
and the light shines along through the ride

2141
02:18:27,446 --> 02:18:30,115
may there be paths for everyone

2142
02:18:30,115 --> 02:18:32,049
lined with hope on either side

2143
02:18:32,084 --> 02:18:36,421
and the light shines along through the ride

2144
02:18:36,421 --> 02:18:38,757
there was a void, but now it's filled

2145
02:18:38,757 --> 02:18:41,021
there was a barrier, but now it's gone

2146
02:18:41,059 --> 02:18:43,755
the sun and the sky

2147
02:18:45,030 --> 02:18:46,759
are right here

2148
02:18:50,502 --> 02:18:54,768
smash the locks, let the sun shine

2149
02:18:54,873 --> 02:18:59,478
hold the light in your hands, make it thine

2150
02:18:59,478 --> 02:19:03,676
break the wells, the river will flow

2151
02:19:04,349 --> 02:19:08,376
inhale it, share it, let it glow

2152
02:19:08,453 --> 02:19:09,147
it's the light

2153
02:19:09,354 --> 02:19:11,481
it belongs to everyone

2154
02:19:11,823 --> 02:19:13,825
it's shining bright

2155
02:19:13,825 --> 02:19:15,850
it belongs to everyone

2156
02:19:16,495 --> 02:19:18,029
it's shining bright

2157
02:19:18,029 --> 02:19:19,097
guruji!

2158
02:19:19,097 --> 02:19:21,600
These are people from century ply.

2159
02:19:21,600 --> 02:19:23,635
They helped enormously in building this.

2160
02:19:23,635 --> 02:19:24,863
Thank you very much.

2161
02:19:25,103 --> 02:19:27,037
Your contribution was indeed very worthy.

2162
02:19:27,072 --> 02:19:29,131
No sir, we just did our duty.

2163
02:19:29,608 --> 02:19:31,643
You're slogging away in a stable...

2164
02:19:31,643 --> 02:19:33,008
with that worthless guy?!

2165
02:19:33,044 --> 02:19:34,773
You'll be thrown out of college.

2166
02:19:35,013 --> 02:19:36,139
You will fail!

2167
02:19:36,414 --> 02:19:37,711
Go ahead and throw me out.

2168
02:19:38,717 --> 02:19:40,412
But, no one can fail me now.

2169
02:19:41,553 --> 02:19:43,612
You see, i have the
best teacher in the world.

2170
02:19:44,089 --> 02:19:44,783
Prabhakar anand.

2171
02:19:46,391 --> 02:19:47,050
Best?!

2172
02:19:48,093 --> 02:19:52,998
We're offering you such brilliant,
expensive teachers, the best facilities...

2173
02:19:52,998 --> 02:19:56,034
and guaranteeing admission to our university.

2174
02:19:56,034 --> 02:19:59,137
And yet you are sending your kids to
that stable to reduce their future to bullshit?!

2175
02:19:59,137 --> 02:20:02,507
Here you teach just by
distributing notes and guess papers.

2176
02:20:02,507 --> 02:20:04,407
Our kids are sick of memorizing everything.

2177
02:20:04,442 --> 02:20:07,045
Whatever that may be.
But we fetch you results!

2178
02:20:07,045 --> 02:20:08,603
Finally, that's all that matters.

2179
02:20:08,947 --> 02:20:09,709
Result!

2180
02:20:10,081 --> 02:20:11,844
Let the exams get over, sir.

2181
02:20:11,883 --> 02:20:13,145
We'll see about the results too.

2182
02:20:13,585 --> 02:20:14,986
It cancels out 2xy, therefore...

2183
02:20:14,986 --> 02:20:18,523
2 into x square plus y square is equal to

2184
02:20:18,523 --> 02:20:21,515
2 into x square plus y square

2185
02:20:21,793 --> 02:20:24,159
q. E. D.

2186
02:20:24,462 --> 02:20:27,098
- That was quite easily done.

2187
02:20:27,098 --> 02:20:28,156
Very good!

2188
02:20:46,418 --> 02:20:52,390
- Eight months ago, dr. Prabhakar anand
began teaching some 5-6 kids here in this stable.

2189
02:20:52,390 --> 02:20:56,292
- Steadily five became 10,
10 to 20, 20 to 100.

2190
02:20:56,328 --> 02:21:00,031
- And today, there are a total
of 327 students of 12th standard!

2191
02:21:00,031 --> 02:21:05,560
- They took free coaching at this preparatory school
and their results are out today.

2192
02:21:05,604 --> 02:21:09,441
- 100% success!
And that too in the 1st division!

2193
02:21:09,441 --> 02:21:13,275
- From slum-dwellers to
those that arrive in luxury cars...

2194
02:21:13,311 --> 02:21:17,215
- all category of children study here.
There is no discrimination here.

2195
02:21:17,215 --> 02:21:21,709
Even those, like k.k. Coaching,
that charge hundreds of thousands of rupees...

2196
02:21:21,753 --> 02:21:25,689
have been beaten by this
free coaching centre that...

2197
02:21:25,724 --> 02:21:28,522
began in a stable
and is now being termed...

2198
02:21:28,560 --> 02:21:29,754
super stable!

2199
02:21:36,001 --> 02:21:38,765
This stable coaching centre
will have to be shut down!

2200
02:22:12,037 --> 02:22:16,371
Sister! Just see what
they've pasted on my gate.

2201
02:22:17,409 --> 02:22:18,034
Just see.

2202
02:22:20,578 --> 02:22:21,442
Oh god!

2203
02:22:22,647 --> 02:22:23,705
What does it say?

2204
02:22:24,249 --> 02:22:25,511
It's an official notice.

2205
02:22:26,051 --> 02:22:28,820
Shambhu uncle, did you take this land
on lease from the government?

2206
02:22:28,820 --> 02:22:31,584
Yes, the then collector,
ramesh chandra...

2207
02:22:31,623 --> 02:22:33,614
got it done 20 years ago.

2208
02:22:34,259 --> 02:22:36,386
The government wants it back now.

2209
02:22:38,063 --> 02:22:41,700
What! But i...
deposit the rent every month!

2210
02:22:41,700 --> 02:22:43,168
I have all the receipts.

2211
02:22:43,168 --> 02:22:43,600
Look.

2212
02:22:43,635 --> 02:22:44,397
What happened?

2213
02:22:46,504 --> 02:22:49,074
They've given us a notice of seven days
but have served it today...

2214
02:22:49,074 --> 02:22:50,598
which is the last day.

2215
02:22:50,642 --> 02:22:54,271
But how can anyone
just snatch my land from me?

2216
02:22:55,480 --> 02:22:59,075
The government wants to sell
this stable and build a warehouse here.

2217
02:23:02,287 --> 02:23:06,155
But we all know who is using this excuse...

2218
02:23:07,225 --> 02:23:09,327
to demolish our stable school...

2219
02:23:09,327 --> 02:23:10,589
and why.

2220
02:23:11,229 --> 02:23:13,094
But this time we won't let it happen!

2221
02:23:13,732 --> 02:23:15,529
We definitely won't, guruji.

2222
02:23:16,267 --> 02:23:17,564
Even if they shoot us!

2223
02:23:47,128 --> 02:23:48,026
Open the gate!

2224
02:23:48,363 --> 02:23:49,489
- You aren't allowed inside!

2225
02:23:56,404 --> 02:24:00,500
Do you people know
why i'm not allowed to go in?

2226
02:24:02,777 --> 02:24:04,768
Because i supported prabhakar sir.

2227
02:24:05,713 --> 02:24:10,946
First they pushed him out of here,
and now they're hell bent on destroying him.

2228
02:24:12,520 --> 02:24:14,010
This is the moment, friends.

2229
02:24:15,089 --> 02:24:18,650
Come with me,
and put an end to their dirty intentions.

2230
02:24:49,757 --> 02:24:51,019
Why should our children go there?

2231
02:24:51,059 --> 02:24:52,185
To get beaten and shot?

2232
02:24:52,727 --> 02:24:54,024
You are absolutely right.

2233
02:24:54,662 --> 02:24:55,822
Why should they go?

2234
02:24:56,231 --> 02:25:00,793
Why did prabhakar anand raise his voice for
the poor and the backward and ruined his life?

2235
02:25:01,135 --> 02:25:05,037
Why does he live in a stable and
work round the clock to teach these kids for free?

2236
02:25:05,139 --> 02:25:05,969
Why?

2237
02:25:07,175 --> 02:25:09,439
Because that isn't merely a stable.

2238
02:25:09,477 --> 02:25:10,569
It is a pathway.

2239
02:25:11,112 --> 02:25:13,637
A pathway for these
and other kids to move ahead.

2240
02:25:14,182 --> 02:25:16,013
To have a better life.

2241
02:25:16,584 --> 02:25:18,552
For them to be educated.

2242
02:25:18,653 --> 02:25:21,121
So that they can hold
their heads high in this society!

2243
02:25:21,155 --> 02:25:24,249
Friends, today that stable needs you.

2244
02:25:25,226 --> 02:25:27,626
Prabhakar sir needs you!

2245
02:25:28,496 --> 02:25:29,827
What is your decision?

2246
02:25:29,864 --> 02:25:31,229
The decision has
already been made, madam.

2247
02:25:32,200 --> 02:25:33,462
No one will go from here.

2248
02:25:33,501 --> 02:25:34,991
Why not?
We'll certainly go!

2249
02:25:36,004 --> 02:25:37,562
Come on, let's go!

2250
02:25:40,975 --> 02:25:41,669
Get lost!

2251
02:25:42,176 --> 02:25:42,733
Hey!

2252
02:25:42,844 --> 02:25:43,708
Hey stop them!

2253
02:25:43,745 --> 02:25:45,144
Don't damage my car!

2254
02:26:39,334 --> 02:26:41,165
It is the government's order!

2255
02:26:42,036 --> 02:26:44,061
This land has to be vacated.

2256
02:26:44,305 --> 02:26:49,538
You people leave quietly
and let us finish our work.

2257
02:26:50,111 --> 02:26:51,669
Otherwise, in one minute...

2258
02:26:51,746 --> 02:26:53,976
there is no need
for any warning, inspector.

2259
02:26:55,016 --> 02:26:56,711
You do your work and we'll do ours.

2260
02:26:57,685 --> 02:26:59,050
Roll the bulldozer!

2261
02:27:00,321 --> 02:27:03,188
You have batons, guns,
a lot of power.

2262
02:27:03,925 --> 02:27:07,190
But, it's obvious that you
aren't aware of our strength.

2263
02:27:07,762 --> 02:27:09,286
We have determination!

2264
02:27:10,965 --> 02:27:12,227
And it's growing now.

2265
02:27:13,601 --> 02:27:15,660
No power can crush it.

2266
02:27:16,270 --> 02:27:18,761
All of you, look carefully
and understand one thing.

2267
02:27:19,273 --> 02:27:23,300
That these kids come
from families that are like yours.

2268
02:27:24,946 --> 02:27:28,211
The dream that they have of a future...

2269
02:27:29,817 --> 02:27:32,251
is the same that is
nurtured in your house too.

2270
02:27:32,620 --> 02:27:37,284
Those powerful contractors and ministers,
on whose orders you've come here...

2271
02:27:37,358 --> 02:27:39,792
they do not want that dream to be realised.

2272
02:27:40,628 --> 02:27:42,255
Now, the choice is yours.

2273
02:27:43,631 --> 02:27:47,032
Do you want to protect this dream...

2274
02:27:48,136 --> 02:27:50,161
or do you want to crush it?

2275
02:28:15,229 --> 02:28:16,423
Hey!
What's going on here?

2276
02:28:19,634 --> 02:28:20,760
Hey, what's happening?

2277
02:28:21,102 --> 02:28:22,797
You have orders to raze this stable.

2278
02:28:23,871 --> 02:28:24,667
Understood?

2279
02:28:26,374 --> 02:28:26,965
Thakur!

2280
02:28:28,209 --> 02:28:29,767
I'll get you stripped of your uniform.

2281
02:28:30,044 --> 02:28:30,908
Understood?

2282
02:28:31,446 --> 02:28:32,879
Do your duty!

2283
02:28:34,849 --> 02:28:36,077
Empty this stable!

2284
02:28:36,851 --> 02:28:38,216
Use your batons...

2285
02:28:38,686 --> 02:28:39,812
and drive everyone out of here!

2286
02:28:39,921 --> 02:28:40,853
Use your batons!

2287
02:28:40,955 --> 02:28:42,149
Demolish that!

2288
02:28:43,124 --> 02:28:44,284
You don't know me...

2289
02:28:46,194 --> 02:28:47,855
hey! Have you lost it or what?

2290
02:28:48,129 --> 02:28:50,324
We had, because we feared you.

2291
02:28:50,398 --> 02:28:51,922
But, now we have
recovered our senses.

2292
02:28:51,999 --> 02:28:53,023
Come on!

2293
02:28:53,134 --> 02:28:54,999
Batons are going to be
used on them now!

2294
02:28:57,872 --> 02:28:59,134
- Do you hear me?

2295
02:29:00,842 --> 02:29:04,710
- Mark my words!
You will be finished!

2296
02:29:06,247 --> 02:29:10,707
I've built a university for 12 billion.

2297
02:29:10,985 --> 02:29:12,282
I will buy everyone out!

2298
02:29:13,121 --> 02:29:14,748
I will buy off this land.

2299
02:29:14,822 --> 02:29:16,687
And... these cops.

2300
02:29:16,724 --> 02:29:17,281
And you too!

2301
02:29:17,358 --> 02:29:18,086
- Enough!

2302
02:29:19,360 --> 02:29:20,088
Enough!

2303
02:29:21,362 --> 02:29:22,954
You've said enough mithilesh singh.

2304
02:29:24,065 --> 02:29:26,226
What is your credibility actually?

2305
02:29:26,300 --> 02:29:28,291
You have pawned your soul itself!

2306
02:29:28,369 --> 02:29:31,031
Your desperation clearly reveals
your bankruptcy.

2307
02:29:31,072 --> 02:29:32,869
Bankruptcy?!

2308
02:29:33,374 --> 02:29:34,238
Bankruptcy?!

2309
02:29:34,275 --> 02:29:38,871
No matter how much poison
greedy frauds like you may unleash...

2310
02:29:38,946 --> 02:29:43,042
this country understands
the value of knowledge and education.

2311
02:29:43,184 --> 02:29:45,516
It knows how to respect its teachers.

2312
02:29:46,354 --> 02:29:48,049
Why 12 billion?

2313
02:29:48,089 --> 02:29:51,752
Even if you stake 12 trillion,
you will get nothing!

2314
02:29:52,360 --> 02:29:55,921
The future of india's education
isn't for sale!

2315
02:29:56,397 --> 02:29:58,763
You had called me a zero, hadn't you?

2316
02:29:59,400 --> 02:30:00,526
Thank you!

2317
02:30:01,235 --> 02:30:04,727
That zero was invented by a great indian.

2318
02:30:05,106 --> 02:30:07,438
Its power you have obviously
failed to comprehend.

2319
02:30:07,542 --> 02:30:11,239
Anyone who collides with a zero,
gets reduced to a zero himself.

2320
02:30:11,279 --> 02:30:12,473
Becomes nothing!

2321
02:30:13,181 --> 02:30:14,170
You...

2322
02:30:14,782 --> 02:30:19,412
and your low-down greedy bosses
have lost your game now.

2323
02:30:19,487 --> 02:30:20,784
You are finished.

2324
02:30:21,556 --> 02:30:22,113
Finished!

2325
02:30:22,223 --> 02:30:23,247
Finished?!

2326
02:30:24,091 --> 02:30:25,080
I?

2327
02:30:25,259 --> 02:30:26,419
Is that so?

2328
02:30:27,094 --> 02:30:28,891
You don't know who i am!

2329
02:30:29,797 --> 02:30:31,788
I will destroy this stable.

2330
02:30:32,466 --> 02:30:33,933
Watch me!

2331
02:30:34,368 --> 02:30:36,029
You'd set out to create a super stable, eh?

2332
02:30:37,038 --> 02:30:38,335
Nowjust wait.

2333
02:30:38,406 --> 02:30:40,806
And watch!
Baburamji...

2334
02:30:42,109 --> 02:30:42,905
- what!

2335
02:30:43,511 --> 02:30:44,500
- What do you mean,
you didn't know?

2336
02:30:45,246 --> 02:30:46,577
Is this why i got you promoted?

2337
02:30:47,215 --> 02:30:48,273
- For a day like this?

2338
02:30:48,382 --> 02:30:49,246
Sir, i'm almost there...

2339
02:30:49,317 --> 02:30:51,217
- just drive the bulldozers over it.

2340
02:30:51,552 --> 02:30:53,952
- And if batons don't work, use bullets.

2341
02:30:54,322 --> 02:30:56,882
- If that stable is not destroyed...

2342
02:30:56,958 --> 02:30:57,982
i'll destroy you!

2343
02:31:00,494 --> 02:31:01,119
D. G... d.g.p. Sir...

2344
02:31:02,797 --> 02:31:03,991
just look at this!

2345
02:31:05,833 --> 02:31:07,926
You have been served with a notice.

2346
02:31:08,336 --> 02:31:10,998
There is no need for a warning.

2347
02:31:11,138 --> 02:31:14,437
After 10 seconds,
there will be a baton-charge!

2348
02:31:14,942 --> 02:31:19,402
And, if we meet with
any resistance from you...

2349
02:31:19,947 --> 02:31:21,209
we will open fire!

2350
02:31:22,016 --> 02:31:23,608
Be ready for a baton-charge!

2351
02:31:29,457 --> 02:31:30,287
- Ten...

2352
02:31:31,259 --> 02:31:31,987
- nine...

2353
02:31:32,026 --> 02:31:33,288
- these people are not
going to obey!

2354
02:31:33,394 --> 02:31:33,985
- Eight...

2355
02:31:34,262 --> 02:31:35,490
- i'm telling you...
this countdown will do nothing!

2356
02:31:35,529 --> 02:31:36,359
- Seven...

2357
02:31:37,031 --> 02:31:38,259
- just roll the bulldozers!

2358
02:31:38,399 --> 02:31:39,195
- Six...

2359
02:31:40,134 --> 02:31:41,032
- five...

2360
02:31:42,003 --> 02:31:42,560
- four...

2361
02:31:42,603 --> 02:31:43,865
- it's no good.

2362
02:31:44,038 --> 02:31:44,527
- Three...

2363
02:31:44,572 --> 02:31:46,267
- i'm telling you,
this man won't budge!

2364
02:31:46,440 --> 02:31:47,134
- Two...

2365
02:31:47,174 --> 02:31:49,870
- this man is actually a criminal!

2366
02:31:55,416 --> 02:31:56,849
- Where are you people looking?

2367
02:31:57,285 --> 02:31:58,343
- Roll the bulldozers!

2368
02:31:59,186 --> 02:32:00,915
All this is illegal!

2369
02:32:01,088 --> 02:32:03,454
- No one is ready to listen!

2370
02:32:03,491 --> 02:32:05,288
- Is there a law or not?

2371
02:32:06,827 --> 02:32:08,021
Shakuntala ma'am!

2372
02:32:08,062 --> 02:32:09,324
- Just watch what i'll do!

2373
02:32:09,864 --> 02:32:11,695
She has never stepped out of hrishikesh.

2374
02:32:12,066 --> 02:32:12,896
Ma'am...

2375
02:32:14,302 --> 02:32:16,429
you've become
the chief minister, prabhu dayal.

2376
02:32:16,704 --> 02:32:19,332
You can't even fill up
the potholes on the roads but...

2377
02:32:20,041 --> 02:32:21,338
you will drive bulldozers over children?

2378
02:32:21,475 --> 02:32:24,000
Please forgive me, ma'am.
I just got to know.

2379
02:32:24,078 --> 02:32:25,340
These people will move away
in a minute.

2380
02:32:25,513 --> 02:32:26,343
- Sorry, ma'am.

2381
02:32:26,380 --> 02:32:27,312
- Come on, come on...

2382
02:32:27,348 --> 02:32:29,373
place your cameras there!

2383
02:32:29,717 --> 02:32:32,083
There... cover that.

2384
02:32:32,186 --> 02:32:33,278
Who is this man?

2385
02:32:33,988 --> 02:32:37,355
He's... uh... the principal of s.t.m.,
mithilesh singh.

2386
02:32:37,858 --> 02:32:40,019
He's lost his mental balance.

2387
02:32:40,294 --> 02:32:41,090
Sir!

2388
02:32:41,762 --> 02:32:42,751
Yes, sir!

2389
02:32:43,097 --> 02:32:44,257
Sir, i'll withdraw them immediately.

2390
02:32:44,899 --> 02:32:46,730
Guruji, the police is leaving.

2391
02:32:46,834 --> 02:32:49,029
Does this mean our stable
won't be demolished?

2392
02:32:49,403 --> 02:32:50,165
It won't be demolished, muniya.

2393
02:32:50,271 --> 02:32:52,102
Greetings, shakuntala ma'am.

2394
02:32:52,139 --> 02:32:53,504
Bless you.

2395
02:32:54,041 --> 02:32:56,942
I saw you 32 years ago.
You're still the same.

2396
02:32:58,212 --> 02:32:59,008
Poorbi...

2397
02:32:59,780 --> 02:33:00,906
this is poorbi, our daughter.

2398
02:33:00,948 --> 02:33:01,277
Bless you.

2399
02:33:01,315 --> 02:33:03,215
- This is deepak kumar, ma'am.

2400
02:33:03,718 --> 02:33:03,945
Namaste.

2401
02:33:04,018 --> 02:33:05,280
University topper from s.t.m.

2402
02:33:06,020 --> 02:33:08,887
Now, i teach here.
With sir. In the stable class.

2403
02:33:10,758 --> 02:33:12,953
I have just one demand, ma'am.

2404
02:33:13,294 --> 02:33:14,761
From the s.t.m. Trust...

2405
02:33:15,663 --> 02:33:16,652
you should have my father... er...

2406
02:33:18,132 --> 02:33:18,757
- discharged!

2407
02:33:18,833 --> 02:33:19,390
Yes, discharged.

2408
02:33:20,668 --> 02:33:21,930
Please discharge him!

2409
02:33:24,038 --> 02:33:25,300
Do you remember...

2410
02:33:25,339 --> 02:33:28,206
when i quit
s.t.m.'s day-to-day affairs?

2411
02:33:28,676 --> 02:33:30,109
Yes, 32 years ago.

2412
02:33:30,644 --> 02:33:32,168
When you became the principal.

2413
02:33:33,014 --> 02:33:36,882
And, you just left,
without even telling me!

2414
02:33:37,651 --> 02:33:39,278
I apologise sincerely for that.

2415
02:33:40,688 --> 02:33:42,849
But, it was clear that
my time there was over.

2416
02:33:43,891 --> 02:33:47,691
And, if i say that
actually your time starts now?

2417
02:33:49,263 --> 02:33:53,131
Madam, i can't become
the principal of s.t.m. Again.

2418
02:33:53,200 --> 02:33:54,189
I have a lot to do here.

2419
02:33:54,268 --> 02:33:56,202
Not s.t.m. But...

2420
02:33:56,404 --> 02:33:58,395
s.t. Remedial centre.

2421
02:33:59,073 --> 02:34:01,132
Aniruddha has told me everything.

2422
02:34:01,442 --> 02:34:05,845
In our own college campus,
we will open a remedial centre where...

2423
02:34:05,913 --> 02:34:10,907
needy and weak students
will receive free coaching.

2424
02:34:11,218 --> 02:34:16,383
And, you will be its principal
and chief trustee for life.

2425
02:35:09,643 --> 02:35:11,907
Q. E. D.

2426
02:35:12,046 --> 02:35:15,106
- That was quite easily done!
