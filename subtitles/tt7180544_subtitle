2
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:09,398
Tell me where's the
slaughter-house?

3
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:11,583
Say "I was taking
them for slaughter".

4
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:13,603
Say "I was taking
them for slaughter".

5
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:14,791
Say it...

6
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,833
Tell me where's the
slaughter-house?

7
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:18,333
Confess it.

8
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,250
Say "I was taking
them for slaughter".

9
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:31,061
Say "I was taking
them for slaughter".

10
00:02:31,085 --> 00:02:32,375
Say it on the video now!

11
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,395
Say "I was taking
them for slaughter".

12
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:37,583
"I was taking them
for slaughter".

13
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:39,791
Say it...

14
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:42,083
Say "I was taking
them for slaughter".

15
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:44,666
Say "I was taking
them for slaughter".

16
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:48,666
Say it...

17
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:11,791
Isn't he one of our guys?

18
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:12,750
No way.

19
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,083
Of course he is!

20
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:20,958
Damn! You're right!
These are our boys!

21
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:21,750
Too heavy?

22
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,750
No.

23
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,036
What else do we have to get?

24
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,375
We need some coriander.

25
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:33,916
Do you want to buy it from
this shop or that one?

26
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,958
Give me some lemons.

27
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:40,458
And coriander.

28
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:41,791
Are you preparing for exams?

29
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:43,291
Yeah. But...

30
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,298
education is not going
to take me anywhere.

31
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:49,166
I'd rather focus on my boxing.

32
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:50,666
Win a bronze at least.

33
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:52,838
And I can get a recommendation
from Bhagwan sir.

34
00:03:52,862 --> 00:03:55,571
Then I can get a government job
with either railways or police.

35
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:56,875
And if that fails too...

36
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:59,523
I can always be a bodyguard to
a politician or a gangster.

37
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,156
You know that gangster Ansari?

38
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,296
He represented India at
the Commonwealth Games.

39
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:05,178
His gang-members are
state level wrestlers.

40
00:04:05,202 --> 00:04:08,875
You've really done
your research!

41
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,458
If that's what you aim
for, then why be a boxer!

42
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:13,583
Be a sharp-shooter!

43
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,125
Stop laughing, shameless!

44
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:18,666
This is exactly why everyone
looks down upon our sports.

45
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,583
Mohan! Just saw your video.

46
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:22,458
- Which one?

47
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:24,438
In which you lynched
the cow-traders.

48
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:25,333
That wasn't me!

49
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,553
Oh really? Then it
must've been your ghost!

50
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,458
Go on... wash that meat!

51
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:31,666
Wasn't him, my ass!

52
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:33,646
It's because of
sportsmen like you...

53
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:36,291
that we barely get medals
in any sport, anymore.

54
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:39,666
Who plays for the sport anymore!

55
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:42,541
Who gives a damn for sportsmen!

56
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:46,458
At home, my father belittles me.

57
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:51,333
Because I chose boxing over my academics.
He's like an mp3 on loop!

58
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,625
Then the sports authorities that
screw us over with their politics!

59
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,125
I think...

60
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:59,375
that my anger with the world will
bring out the Mike Tyson in me.

61
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:04,333
As a coach, I understand
these boxers slacking off.

62
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:07,416
No one believes in
exercise and discipline.

63
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,356
Ask them to run a
few kilometers...

64
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,666
they'll get to a teashop
and while away the time.

65
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:13,166
Got everything, coach.

66
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:18,583
That's why I make them do chores...
carry sacks of wheat -

67
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:21,541
- Listen, keep it inside.

68
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,833
Okay, coach.

69
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,291
And that's how they
get their exercise...

70
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:30,291
or they start to get lazy.

71
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:45,000
Where should I keep this?

72
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,000
Sunaina, show him
the store room.

73
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:57,250
None of the ingredients of your meat curry
should pollute the sanctity of my home..

74
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:01,250
Cook your meat outside.

75
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:13,666
Should I put it here?

76
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,625
I've kept the sack inside.

77
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:43,125
I've put it in there!

78
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,533
Alright! The entire neighbourhood
doesn't need to know!

79
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:48,458
Not a single plate of
meat should come in here.

80
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:51,833
There's soap at the water pump,
eat outside and clean up outside.

81
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:53,333
Ok.

82
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,541
You guys are still doing this?

83
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,041
What can we do?

84
00:06:58,458 --> 00:06:59,858
Are you guys washing
it with soap?!

85
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,791
That's hand-soap!

86
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:03,875
Woah! That's a lot!

87
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:05,958
Did 'Boss' butcher
an entire goat?

88
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,083
Must be around 10-12 kilos.

89
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,541
Bhagwan sir will have
2 kilos on his own.

90
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:15,666
Listen... does boss
have a daughter?

91
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,291
No. He has no children.

92
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:20,458
But the Bhiwani model has already
produced six olympian boxers.

93
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:24,125
The Bhiwani model is crap!

94
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,458
It's a complete copy
of the Cuba model.

95
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:31,000
You expect me to copy an
already copied model?

96
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,458
What did you do before
becoming a journalist?

97
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:39,333
I used to play Badminton.

98
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:42,916
Get the hell off of me!

99
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:47,208
I asked you to loosen my
muscles, not break my bones!

100
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:48,708
My elbow slipped.

101
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,791
If mine slips, it's
really going to hurt you!

102
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:55,416
Go, get the massage oil.

103
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:58,596
Years of training and this idiot
still doesn't know how to massage.

104
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:01,166
Wants to be a boxer!

105
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:04,875
Won't survive a round
against the pros!

106
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,655
Quit staring at me! Get the oil!

107
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:09,250
The pros don't stand
a chance against me!

108
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,541
Put me in the ring and see!

109
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:13,125
What?

110
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:15,916
You said - "Won't survive
against the pros" -

111
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:18,250
I'm saying they
won't survive me!

112
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,125
Try me!

113
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,625
Stop arguing. Get the oil.

114
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:25,041
Coach, pardon me for saying...

115
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:29,916
but we're training to be boxers.
Not masseurs!

116
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:33,458
You treat us like slaves.

117
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,518
You make us shop,
chop, peel and clean!

118
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:38,416
Those guys are washing meat.

119
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,750
I had to get flour.

120
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:44,750
Is this how you're going to
create a Mike Tyson, coach?

121
00:08:56,041 --> 00:09:00,208
It wasn't my jab, that
started the brawl...

122
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:04,791
It wasn't my punch,
that brought my fall...

123
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:09,375
Sound of my chains,
is silence no more...

124
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:13,958
The fall of your pride,
that had no reason...

125
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:18,583
This fancy love, my
plight to treason...

126
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:23,875
To speak up the truth,
is defiance no more...

127
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:25,875
Cut and hooks Crips and blood.

128
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,333
Broken bones... knee
deep in shit...

129
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,666
It had to be...
what was to be...

130
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:33,000
It had to be...
what was to be...

131
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,125
It had to be...
what was to be...

132
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,458
Brawl and Broil...
A Battle Royale...

133
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:39,708
Brawl and Broil...
A Battle Royale...

134
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:42,041
Black n blue...
Kicks in Groin...

135
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:43,833
You're my friends!

136
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:44,833
What's happening?!

137
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:48,833
I really don't want
to hit you all...

138
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,875
Shravan, stop!

139
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,215
At least tell us why you're fighting!
- Mohan!

140
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:02,208
Please stop! - Go ask boss!

141
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,625
Power was his sparring game...

142
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:11,625
For I, to bob and weave...

143
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,333
For a Brawler...

144
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,583
For a Brawler...
it's all the same...

145
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:20,916
a pawn... a knight... a queen...

146
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:23,458
For every Rabbit
punch he threw...

147
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,458
I shadowed, slipped and swung...

148
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,166
Pulled a cross in every round...

149
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,458
A counterpunch that stung...

150
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:32,875
Broken teeth...
Blood and Spit...

151
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:35,333
Broken bones... Knee
deep in shit...

152
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,583
It had to be...
What was to be...

153
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,958
It had to be...
What was to be...

154
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:41,958
It had to be...
What was to be...

155
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:46,625
Brawl and Broil...
A Battle Royale...

156
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,958
Black n blue...
Kicks in Groin...

157
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,416
Brawl and Broil...
A Battle Royale...

158
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,666
Brawl and Broil...
A Battle Royale...

159
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:57,666
Black n blue...
Kicks in Groin...

160
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:02,416
It wasn't my jab... that
started the brawl...

161
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:06,958
It wasn't my punch...
that brought my fall...

162
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:10,958
Sound of my chains...
is silence no more...

163
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:21,416
It's time to light the funeral pyre.
Your boxing dream is dead.

164
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:25,000
As long as I - Bhagwan
Das Mishra - live.

165
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,583
I won't let you box again.

166
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:32,000
You better go elsewhere!

167
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,000
Bloody moron!

168
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:43,125
Get my phone!

169
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:05,958
Our road to love is
rough, O' dear...

170
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:19,458
A game of hearts, can't
bluff, O' dear...

171
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:22,541
Listen, pass me a towel.

172
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:27,791
Stop staring, get me a towel.

173
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:31,791
Are you deaf?

174
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,083
I am asking for a towel!

175
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:39,083
Can't you hear?

176
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,583
You think I can't see what
you are trying to do?

177
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,375
Why did you hit her?

178
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:55,875
What did she do?!

179
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:56,958
I asked for a towel.

180
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:58,625
We heard! All of us did.

181
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,285
So your wife brought you one.

182
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:02,875
That's what she was
trying to tell you.

183
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:04,375
What are you staring at?

184
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:06,666
I'll rip your eyes out!

185
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,166
Go outside.

186
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,666
Go outside, Sunaina.

187
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:13,666
Go!

188
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:18,041
Doesn't respect elders!

189
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:20,261
I don't want that filth
in my house again..

190
00:15:20,285 --> 00:15:23,785
If I lose my mind someday,
I'll chop her head off!

191
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,083
When you know you can't
speak for yourself...

192
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:46,083
it's best to bow your head
and keep your eyes low.

193
00:15:51,726 --> 00:15:52,726
What?

194
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,833
Nothing.

195
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:55,333
Can I get a sheet?

196
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:58,041
Sunaina. That's
your name, right?

197
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,833
You must be wondering
who is writing to you?

198
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:08,875
I'm the same boxer whom you saw
getting beat up by your uncle.

199
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,916
I've haven't stopped
thinking about you since.

200
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:15,166
Each day is a battle.

201
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:18,875
I'll tell you my name when
me meet face-to-face.

202
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:21,333
If you don't know it already.

203
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:25,166
You are cemented in
my mind and heart.

204
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:28,125
Now your mind and heart
are free to decide.

205
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:32,291
All my love, Yours Truly.

206
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:36,291
Hey! Can I get another sheet?

207
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:40,291
Just one.

208
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:52,541
Where do I sign?

209
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:54,458
Your name isn't in the register.

210
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:58,958
Our road to love is
rough, O' dear...

211
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:02,958
A game of hearts, can't
bluff, O' dear...

212
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:21,750
You're a daughter to a plutocrat,
I'm a frustrated mistake.

213
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:26,250
You're fair and charming, pampered
brat I'm a juvenile keepsake...

214
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,708
I'm a juvenile keepsake...

215
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,291
She didn't even look at you.

216
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,000
I've come to look at her!

217
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,458
You're nested in a Queen's Mansion
I'm a homeless hobo hikin'

218
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:42,125
You're sleek as Porsche 911I'm
a drowning boat of a vikin'

219
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:46,541
I'm a drowning boat of a vikin'

220
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:51,416
If silent love that we partake...
softly grows within...

221
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:53,375
She's looking at me!

222
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:57,916
Oh god! I'm blushing.

223
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:06,416
He'll thrash me like an angry cop...
And put my hands in cuffs, O' dear.

224
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:14,625
Our road to love is rough, O' dear... A
game of hearts, can't bluff, O' dear...

225
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:18,000
Our family priest predicted
my future for me.

226
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,916
He says I'm bound to get
two things in life -

227
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:24,666
Progress and Success.

228
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,750
Progress will come
to me when I'm 28.

229
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,458
And success will
follow right after.

230
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,208
I just turned 28.

231
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,416
By the way, what's your name?

232
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:34,916
Pragati Dubey.

233
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,083
Tiwari.

234
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:39,250
Gopal Tiwari.

235
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,000
That's my number.
Save it as 'TYSON'.

236
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:46,541
You're bonus on a Xmas eve, I'm
a failing labour strike...

237
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:51,041
You're a michelin starred dessert...
I'm a stale bread no one likes...

238
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:55,041
I'm a stale bread
no one likes...

239
00:18:57,791 --> 00:19:02,375
You're a showstopper for the fashion
weeks I'm a hideous drunken farce..

240
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:06,833
Your touch as soft as velvet skin...
I'm as rough as badger's arse.

241
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:11,250
I'm as rough as badger's arse.

242
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:19,750
My heart's swollen, ripe with love...
don't prick it with a spear.

243
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:24,541
Our road to love is rough, O' dear... A
game of hearts, can't bluff, O' dear...

244
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:38,559
Listen!

245
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:39,875
I've informed your father,

246
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:45,083
that your boxer is coming
to see him at the temple...

247
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,125
to speak about marriage.

248
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:48,625
But let me tell you...

249
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:52,333
nothing is going to come out it.

250
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:55,250
There is going to be a riot
if this marriage happens...

251
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,190
and your uncle is
gonna cause it.

252
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,000
My uncle is NOT my father...

253
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:14,958
Shravan?

254
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:16,416
Sir...

255
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,586
My younger brother is not
a very agreeable man..

256
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,038
And he doesn't like you.

257
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:21,775
Why do you want to
destroy it all?

258
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:24,416
I am not trying to
destroy anything...

259
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:26,250
He is the one with an ego..

260
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,083
But you won't
apologize either...

261
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,000
Am I the one who
wants to marry...

262
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,500
or my uncle...?

263
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:33,458
Of course, it's your wedding...

264
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:35,833
But your uncle's honour
won't allow it...

265
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:37,373
he'll get us all killed...

266
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:41,750
you.. your father... your hero ..
And me... he'll kill us all...

267
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:45,333
I'll slit his
throat before that.

268
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:48,713
Just because his name 'Bhagwan' means
'God'... it doesn't make him 'God'

269
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,333
God belongs here...
in the temple...

270
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,473
and everyone is aware
of his crimes...

271
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:55,208
you included.

272
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:57,416
You probably know more..
You're family...

273
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,636
What will you two survive
on post-marriage?

274
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,583
My mother is a great cook.

275
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,003
So you'll live off your
father all your life...?

276
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:06,458
When you married dad...

277
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,708
he was unemployed too.

278
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:10,666
But he had a lot of property...

279
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:11,458
But we had fields
in our village?

280
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:15,041
Yeah... they were grandfather's
but at least we had it...

281
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:19,458
His family doesn't
sleep hungry either...

282
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:20,958
How old are you?

283
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:21,458
Twenty-nine...

284
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:22,958
Ever had a job...?

285
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,730
If I win the tournament
next month...

286
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:26,926
I'll have a confirmed
job with the Railways..

287
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:27,791
And if you don't...?

288
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:31,916
Will you respect an
unemployed husband...?

289
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,458
When you were a kid... yes..

290
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:37,416
I would do the house work..
yes.. so...

291
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:38,996
cooked... cleaned... yeah..

292
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,833
- And dad slept all day...

293
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:44,541
- You still respected
him right...?

294
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:46,583
He does.

295
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:49,458
At least this one
fights for us...

296
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:52,791
Of course he'll fight...
he's a boxer...

297
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:54,291
Hey... easy...!

298
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:57,458
What now...?

299
00:21:57,958 --> 00:22:01,458
Who looks at you? Singh?

300
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,916
That superstar... Ranveer Singh?

301
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:08,708
The way he looks at her...

302
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:11,458
Looks at whom?

303
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:15,000
Deepika Padukone? The actress?

304
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:21,666
Got it... your boxer looks at you...
like that hero looks at his heroine..

305
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:23,166
Right?

306
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:24,291
Look son...

307
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:26,750
Ranveer Sir lives in Mumbai...

308
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,916
as does Deepika Ma'am.

309
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:31,125
But we live here
in a small town...

310
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:35,875
Now... I don't know how
liberal her father was...

311
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:40,416
but I'm sure... I've been as
liberal within my capacity...

312
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:42,476
Don't cite films stars
as an example...

313
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,916
Actresses in India can get away
with more than the average woman

314
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:47,616
they can marry... or not...

315
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:50,208
but in this town that's
not how it works...

316
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:54,458
I won't let my daughter be
dishonoured by marrying down...

317
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:58,166
So get a job and
then we'll talk.

318
00:22:58,666 --> 00:23:00,866
Only few days to the District tournament.
- Yeah I know.

319
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:03,458
This time you have to qualify.

320
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:05,541
Are you exercising your eye?

321
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:08,125
My eyesight is perfect.

322
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:10,416
- Can I ask you something?
- Ask me.

323
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:13,958
If your Juliet wasn't
your boss' niece...

324
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:16,125
would you still be
at war with him?

325
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:17,625
- What do you mean?!

326
00:23:17,958 --> 00:23:20,041
Boxing is your one true passion... right?
- Yes..

327
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:22,166
And for that you would
go to any length?

328
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:24,750
So why don't you just
apologise to your boss?

329
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,333
- Don't you know love is blind!

330
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:29,833
Blind, yes. But not stupid!

331
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:31,416
Listen, Gopal.

332
00:23:31,916 --> 00:23:34,250
She fell for me because...

333
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,625
I stood up to her
uncle's tyranny.

334
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:39,458
It's too late now
to undo the damage.

335
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:44,125
Now shut up, and
hold my feet up.

336
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:48,125
What did you do?

337
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:53,791
I know a guy who can
stitch it back to new.

338
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:55,458
Don't worry.

339
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:57,478
Figured out a plan
for your new shoes.

340
00:23:57,541 --> 00:23:57,625
Tell me...

341
00:23:58,125 --> 00:23:59,805
You know the big sweet
shop in the market?

342
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:01,478
- Yes. I made a bet
with it's owner...

343
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:02,625
What's the bet?

344
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,430
You have to break five
bricks in one chop.

345
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:06,583
- What?
- Loser pays 2500 rupees.

346
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:09,458
Have you lost your mind?!

347
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:11,791
I can't break more
than three bricks!

348
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:13,371
If you can't, then who can.

349
00:24:13,708 --> 00:24:15,041
It's time to build
your strength.

350
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:16,541
Let's go.

351
00:24:16,581 --> 00:24:18,101
How many bricks could
Bruce Lee break?

352
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:18,291
Bruce Lee?

353
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:19,208
Yeah.

354
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,041
In China, they don't use bricks.

355
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:24,666
Bruce Lee was from Hollywood...
not China!

356
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:27,125
Come on tiger! Now
let's do five!

357
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:29,105
One at a time.. I
can't risk my hand.

358
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:32,750
- Put four.
- Alright.

359
00:24:34,934 --> 00:24:35,934
There you go!

360
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:39,791
Now put five!

361
00:24:40,291 --> 00:24:40,458
Go for it!

362
00:24:40,958 --> 00:24:44,458
Hail the Monkey-God!

363
00:24:57,541 --> 00:25:00,458
I'm ugly as a snoring troll,
You're lovely aphrodite...

364
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:03,916
I'm the darkest demon of the hell
You're heaven's grace almighty.

365
00:25:04,416 --> 00:25:07,333
You're a tranquil stream of love...
I'm a chaotic disquiet.

366
00:25:07,833 --> 00:25:11,000
You're pious peace, a flying dove...
I'm a violent ethnic riot..

367
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,180
You're Taj Mahal on a starry night,
I'm a barren, unmarked grave...

368
00:25:14,625 --> 00:25:21,041
You're blessing of the lords of
love, I'm Satan's conclave...

369
00:25:21,541 --> 00:25:24,458
You're a soft and sombre violin
I'm a loud and noisy drum...

370
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:31,458
You're flawless like a Klashnikov...
I'm a faulty, useless gun..

371
00:25:31,958 --> 00:25:34,750
You're crowned and fierce lioness
I'm a pet, grizzly bear...

372
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:39,875
Now, listen!

373
00:25:40,375 --> 00:25:43,291
You're charming as a playful
child I'm a poor man's despair

374
00:25:43,791 --> 00:25:46,791
I'm a battered run-down piece of
land You're a millionaire's suite

375
00:25:47,291 --> 00:25:50,291
I'm a poisonous home made beer,
You're a glass of whiskey, neat.

376
00:25:50,791 --> 00:25:53,583
You're Beyonce ruling MTV
I'm dull radio news.

377
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:57,125
You're modest as a beauty-queen
I'm mankind's abuse.

378
00:25:57,625 --> 00:26:00,458
You're the monarch...
I'm a muck.

379
00:26:00,958 --> 00:26:06,000
You're the winner...
I'm out of luck.

380
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,000
I'm just a bystander,
don't ask me to compete

381
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,625
I'll fail and fall on my face
tasting my own defeat, O' dear.

382
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:16,625
Our road to love is rough, O' dear... A
game of hearts, can't bluff, O' dear...

383
00:26:30,291 --> 00:26:31,916
You were amazing.

384
00:26:32,416 --> 00:26:34,750
Thank you.

385
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:38,750
I'll be right back.

386
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:52,625
Sir, I can barely hear you!

387
00:26:53,125 --> 00:26:56,166
No, not someone else's wedding!
I'm at my own!

388
00:26:56,666 --> 00:26:58,041
Just give me two days.

389
00:26:58,541 --> 00:27:01,250
I'll give you a demo before
I leave for my honeymoon!

390
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,291
I promise!

391
00:27:03,791 --> 00:27:05,511
By the way, a new product
has just come in.

392
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:09,416
It's like fertiliser
for your hair!

393
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:21,750
"I won over your heart."

394
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:23,250
Amazing.

395
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:29,333
"I've a jovial heart."

396
00:27:29,833 --> 00:27:35,333
"And in this ambiance
of fun and frolic..."

397
00:27:35,833 --> 00:27:36,993
"I had a little to drink."

398
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:38,250
Some snacks?

399
00:27:38,583 --> 00:27:41,750
"I had a little to drink."

400
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:44,166
They are nice.

401
00:27:44,666 --> 00:27:45,916
"Tie those trinklets..."

402
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:48,666
"Tie those trinklets
around my feet."

403
00:27:49,166 --> 00:27:51,125
"And watch my gait."

404
00:27:51,625 --> 00:27:52,708
"And watch my gait."

405
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:54,458
I'm almost twenty-six now.

406
00:27:54,958 --> 00:27:58,125
I don't want to waste my
life playing a housewife...

407
00:27:58,625 --> 00:28:01,125
to the big shots who
come to the house...

408
00:28:01,625 --> 00:28:04,305
asking to marry me. They'll tie
me like a cow in their backyard.

409
00:28:04,625 --> 00:28:09,250
Get a job soon and marry me. Or
come join the bonfire party...

410
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:12,958
when they burn my
hope and dreams!

411
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:16,958
Someone give my love a chance...
then see the fercoity of my dance...

412
00:28:23,375 --> 00:28:30,166
The nose-ring tingles with laughter...
The earring swings in a trance...

413
00:28:30,666 --> 00:28:35,791
Every maiden's heart will freeze...
When they see me pull out my stance...

414
00:28:36,291 --> 00:28:37,666
What is this idiot doing here?

415
00:28:38,166 --> 00:28:39,166
He is the groom's friend.

416
00:28:39,541 --> 00:28:47,083
A bride gives her lover a shy glance
Their union makes me want to romance.

417
00:28:47,583 --> 00:28:50,958
Someone give me...

418
00:28:51,458 --> 00:28:56,333
Someone give my love a chance...
Then see the fercoity of my dance...

419
00:28:56,833 --> 00:29:02,125
Someone give my love a chance...
Then see the fercoity of my dance...

420
00:29:02,625 --> 00:29:07,041
See my ferocity...

421
00:29:07,541 --> 00:29:10,261
Someone give my love a chance...
Then see the fercoity of my dance...

422
00:29:10,285 --> 00:29:13,785
See my ferocity...

423
00:29:22,166 --> 00:29:25,666
Turn off the gas, please.

424
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,208
Our neighbour's son got
a job in the capital.

425
00:29:35,708 --> 00:29:38,458
Wasn't he your classmate?

426
00:29:38,958 --> 00:29:41,458
Hmm.

427
00:29:41,958 --> 00:29:46,000
In this country, even Olympic
medalists can't afford a house!

428
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,900
You think can live
off your boxing?

429
00:29:48,083 --> 00:29:48,250
Hmm.

430
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,666
What "hmm"? Please
answer my question.

431
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:52,166
My mouth is full.

432
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:53,291
So? Empty it.

433
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:53,666
Spit it out.

434
00:29:54,166 --> 00:29:54,666
Spit where?

435
00:29:55,166 --> 00:29:56,541
Spit into my mouth.

436
00:29:57,041 --> 00:29:59,291
You've shat on my dreams,
pissed on my honour...

437
00:29:59,791 --> 00:30:01,151
might as well spit in my mouth!

438
00:30:01,175 --> 00:30:02,708
Listen up! I'm
putting up the list.

439
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:07,125
Everyone on the list needs to
report at 8am sharp, day after.

440
00:30:07,625 --> 00:30:09,166
Latecomers will be disqualified.

441
00:30:09,666 --> 00:30:10,041
Okay, sir.

442
00:30:10,541 --> 00:30:13,166
All the matches are listed here.

443
00:30:13,666 --> 00:30:14,666
Check my name.

444
00:30:14,958 --> 00:30:16,125
Check it one by one.

445
00:30:16,625 --> 00:30:16,833
Check mine.

446
00:30:17,333 --> 00:30:17,750
Don't rush!

447
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,250
Come one.

448
00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:22,875
I am in.

449
00:30:26,166 --> 00:30:28,125
Bhatia sir!

450
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:31,041
My name isn't on the District
Tournament list again!

451
00:30:31,541 --> 00:30:33,333
My weight is within
the category.

452
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:37,113
All the boxers that I've knocked out in
under two minutes have made it on the list!

453
00:30:37,137 --> 00:30:37,637
I haven't! Why?

454
00:30:37,857 --> 00:30:39,017
You have high blood pressure.

455
00:30:39,041 --> 00:30:40,321
How the hell can my BP be high?!

456
00:30:40,345 --> 00:30:42,125
What do you mean how?
Look at you raging!

457
00:30:42,625 --> 00:30:45,291
Fine. I'll shower in icy
water till it goes down.

458
00:30:45,791 --> 00:30:48,458
Last year I was told
my eyesight was weak.

459
00:30:48,958 --> 00:30:50,878
I ate papayas, and did
headstands all year long!

460
00:30:51,291 --> 00:30:52,851
I got a certificate
from my doctor too.

461
00:30:53,125 --> 00:30:55,605
The year before that, I had a
minor cut and you disallowed me.

462
00:30:56,105 --> 00:30:58,545
What if the minor cut had become
major while you were boxing?

463
00:30:58,569 --> 00:31:01,333
No Sports Officer is going to
risk his job to let you play!

464
00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:02,833
Do you have a connection?

465
00:31:02,958 --> 00:31:06,333
At least find a reasonable
excuse to not allow me to box.

466
00:31:06,833 --> 00:31:07,833
Go speak to a doctor.

467
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:09,926
What if I get a health
certificate from him?

468
00:31:10,333 --> 00:31:11,583
He needs to be a Sports doctor!

469
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:15,043
The certificate has to be government
approved, Boxing Federation approved!

470
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:17,958
Then it needs to be attested by
an authorised civil servant!

471
00:31:18,458 --> 00:31:19,458
I'll get it done.

472
00:31:19,541 --> 00:31:21,041
And most importantly,
the boss...

473
00:31:21,541 --> 00:31:24,041
Bhagwan Das should
be in a mood...

474
00:31:24,541 --> 00:31:28,041
to want to read it.

475
00:31:48,708 --> 00:31:52,208
Sit here.

476
00:32:12,041 --> 00:32:15,541
Greetings, coach sir!

477
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:35,625
Bring the bottle. - Yes, sir.

478
00:33:02,916 --> 00:33:04,291
You want to box?

479
00:33:04,791 --> 00:33:08,458
Yes, coach.

480
00:33:08,958 --> 00:33:12,708
Gulp it down...

481
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:16,708
It's nectar. Gulp it.

482
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:24,083
I'll let you box.

483
00:33:32,833 --> 00:33:36,541
We were hoping to have
'Spotless' Detergent...

484
00:33:37,041 --> 00:33:40,458
be our main sponsor.

485
00:33:40,958 --> 00:33:44,541
We'd like to name our Boxing
Championship prize...

486
00:33:45,041 --> 00:33:46,583
the 'Spotless Detergent' Cup.

487
00:33:47,083 --> 00:33:48,643
Our eleven winners
are the ones who...

488
00:33:49,041 --> 00:33:53,250
end up representing our state
in the National Championship.

489
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:57,250
Would you like to
partner with us?

490
00:34:10,291 --> 00:34:14,458
She's my niece!

491
00:34:14,958 --> 00:34:18,458
Where did you get this?

492
00:34:25,958 --> 00:34:29,458
So... you want her?

493
00:34:34,892 --> 00:34:35,892
Hurry up.

494
00:34:35,916 --> 00:34:36,916
Gopal.

495
00:34:37,416 --> 00:34:39,416
Sunaina has given
me an ultimatum.

496
00:34:39,916 --> 00:34:41,375
What did she say?

497
00:34:41,875 --> 00:34:43,875
She's meeting a
prospective groom, today.

498
00:34:44,375 --> 00:34:46,125
The owner of 'Spotless
Detergent'.

499
00:34:46,625 --> 00:34:48,791
If I don't play this year
then it'll all be over.

500
00:34:49,291 --> 00:34:50,750
That Bhagwan Sir!

501
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:53,041
If he sets his mind
against someone...

502
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:55,208
he'll find a way to
annihilate them.

503
00:34:55,708 --> 00:34:58,125
He isn't as harmless
as he looks!

504
00:34:58,625 --> 00:35:01,750
He's the cruelest bastard
I've ever known.

505
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:04,750
You should see how disrespectfully
he treats his own brother.

506
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:08,750
Sunaina's dad? - Yes.

507
00:35:11,416 --> 00:35:13,208
Welcome.

508
00:35:13,708 --> 00:35:16,125
This is my elder brother, Gopaldas.
- Greetings.

509
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:19,041
He is so subservient and
voiceless around Bhagwan Sir...

510
00:35:19,541 --> 00:35:21,421
even though he is twelve
years elder to him.

511
00:35:21,833 --> 00:35:25,125
Sunaina's wedding is just a business
transaction for Bhagwan Sir

512
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:27,945
and she has to constantly find
new ways to turn them down.

513
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:29,885
Because she can't express
herself at home...

514
00:35:30,208 --> 00:35:35,125
she slaps me around and
takes it all out on me.

515
00:35:35,625 --> 00:35:38,833
You'll weep like a child
if you read her letters.

516
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:42,541
I've saved them carefully
over two years.

517
00:35:43,041 --> 00:35:44,441
Remember when I
broke three bricks?

518
00:35:44,916 --> 00:35:46,596
I was so furious after
reading her letter.

519
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:49,601
I wrote Bhagwan on one brick, Das
on second and Mishra on third.

520
00:35:49,958 --> 00:35:53,458
Broke all in one angry chop!

521
00:36:03,791 --> 00:36:05,208
They are here!

522
00:36:05,708 --> 00:36:07,708
Let's go.

523
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:13,833
The boy has arrived.

524
00:36:14,333 --> 00:36:16,708
I know why you're upset.

525
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:19,250
We don't have a choice.

526
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:25,208
All the boys reject you
for your handicap.

527
00:36:25,708 --> 00:36:27,458
I'm not handicapped!

528
00:36:27,958 --> 00:36:30,041
I just can't speak. That's all!

529
00:36:30,541 --> 00:36:32,250
I didn't mean that.

530
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:35,041
I will never marry a man...

531
00:36:35,541 --> 00:36:36,541
who pities me.

532
00:36:36,791 --> 00:36:38,166
"Oh poor girl."

533
00:36:38,666 --> 00:36:39,916
"Can't speak."

534
00:36:40,416 --> 00:36:41,416
"It's okay"

535
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:42,666
"I will marry her."

536
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:45,291
And when we step out together...

537
00:36:45,791 --> 00:36:48,916
the entire world will judge us.

538
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:50,958
"He can't walk."

539
00:36:51,458 --> 00:36:52,750
"She can't talk."

540
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:56,750
"A match made in
Handicap Heaven!"

541
00:37:02,041 --> 00:37:03,416
Woah! Check out that car!

542
00:37:03,916 --> 00:37:07,125
Even I would marry him for that!

543
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:09,125
Happy, rich and gay.

544
00:37:09,625 --> 00:37:13,125
Shut up!

545
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:34,458
Is it a funeral?

546
00:37:34,958 --> 00:37:39,291
Always wears black!

547
00:37:39,791 --> 00:37:42,458
No one here will marry
a disreputed girl.

548
00:37:42,958 --> 00:37:44,250
Means?

549
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,958
Let's go give her
a bad reputation.

550
00:37:47,458 --> 00:37:48,625
Bro... Wait!

551
00:37:49,125 --> 00:37:52,625
Think it through. She'll beat
you again if she finds out!

552
00:37:58,208 --> 00:38:00,458
Let's just do it.

553
00:38:00,958 --> 00:38:02,125
Driver's in there!

554
00:38:02,625 --> 00:38:04,916
Who cares!

555
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:09,250
Light's already half broken.

556
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:10,750
Let's break it fully.

557
00:38:11,041 --> 00:38:11,458
What?

558
00:38:11,958 --> 00:38:13,916
I said.. let's finish
it completely!

559
00:38:14,416 --> 00:38:17,916
- Run!
- Run!

560
00:38:21,208 --> 00:38:22,666
Start it up.

561
00:38:23,166 --> 00:38:24,958
Start it up.

562
00:38:25,458 --> 00:38:26,458
He's coming.

563
00:38:26,625 --> 00:38:30,916
- Run!
- Run!

564
00:38:31,416 --> 00:38:34,916
Don't worry! Your
scooter is insured.

565
00:38:47,184 --> 00:38:48,184
Hello.

566
00:38:48,208 --> 00:38:50,458
Can I speak to the Inspector?
This is Bhagwandas.

567
00:38:50,958 --> 00:38:52,791
Bhagwan Das... who?

568
00:38:53,291 --> 00:38:55,083
Bhagwan Das Boxer!

569
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,750
We haven't met yet... is the
only reason you're still alive.

570
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:01,958
I'll barge into your ass and
play the drums with it!

571
00:39:02,458 --> 00:39:02,916
Hand him the phone.

572
00:39:03,416 --> 00:39:05,458
He didn't break anything.

573
00:39:05,958 --> 00:39:08,333
I broke the light.

574
00:39:08,833 --> 00:39:09,833
Why?

575
00:39:10,083 --> 00:39:12,791
Because I am crazy
about Sunaina.

576
00:39:13,291 --> 00:39:15,458
The light was already
half-broken.

577
00:39:15,958 --> 00:39:17,458
Doc..

578
00:39:17,958 --> 00:39:20,791
There's an emergency case.

579
00:39:21,291 --> 00:39:24,791
I want you to take care of it.

580
00:39:51,125 --> 00:39:54,625
Why you...

581
00:40:05,333 --> 00:40:06,958
I don't get you.

582
00:40:07,458 --> 00:40:09,916
You're fighting the man
whose daughter you love.

583
00:40:10,416 --> 00:40:13,916
She's not his daughter.

584
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:20,666
Bhagwan Sir can't have children.

585
00:40:21,166 --> 00:40:23,006
His cigar doesn't have
any tobacco in it, see.

586
00:40:23,416 --> 00:40:26,333
Your broke his guest's car.

587
00:40:26,833 --> 00:40:29,458
Publicly humiliated him.

588
00:40:29,958 --> 00:40:31,916
Love his niece.

589
00:40:32,416 --> 00:40:33,696
And then you want to be a boxer.

590
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:36,625
So?

591
00:40:37,125 --> 00:40:39,000
Do you truly love her...

592
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:43,000
or you're pretending so you
can dishonour Bhagwan?

593
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,916
Our love is so pure...

594
00:40:46,416 --> 00:40:49,208
that it could heal the sick.

595
00:40:49,708 --> 00:40:51,041
Should've been a doctor then!

596
00:40:51,541 --> 00:40:52,958
Why get caught in this mess!

597
00:40:53,458 --> 00:40:55,416
The two men you
beat up inside...

598
00:40:55,916 --> 00:40:57,458
are politically connected goons.

599
00:40:57,958 --> 00:41:00,166
Their political connection
isn't a free pass to me.

600
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:03,041
Doesn't mean you
become a John Rambo!

601
00:41:03,541 --> 00:41:04,541
Be invisible.

602
00:41:04,958 --> 00:41:11,333
Use the prison time
to focus on boxing.

603
00:41:11,833 --> 00:41:15,916
That's your only way up in life.

604
00:41:16,416 --> 00:41:18,416
Don't let them distract you.

605
00:41:18,916 --> 00:41:20,125
With a musty morsel,

606
00:41:20,625 --> 00:41:22,916
Fed our hunger with
a punch in the gut.

607
00:41:23,416 --> 00:41:27,375
Our hard earned money.

608
00:41:27,875 --> 00:41:29,541
You robbed our money

609
00:41:30,041 --> 00:41:31,625
and loaned it back to us.

610
00:41:32,125 --> 00:41:34,000
Tied a rock to our heads,

611
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,375
pushed headfirst into the river.

612
00:41:36,875 --> 00:41:40,375
In our own narratives, We're
reduced to two-bit minors.

613
00:41:40,875 --> 00:41:42,875
Come death, come defeat,

614
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:45,375
We'll fight to the hilt!

615
00:41:45,875 --> 00:41:49,375
For all your pride,
to hell with you!

616
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:53,666
To hell with obedience!

617
00:41:54,166 --> 00:41:58,166
Screaming to the skies,
to hell with you!

618
00:41:58,666 --> 00:42:02,166
To hell with obedience!

619
00:42:11,226 --> 00:42:12,226
Hello, Sir.

620
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:13,291
All good?

621
00:42:13,791 --> 00:42:14,791
I wanted to talk to you.

622
00:42:14,875 --> 00:42:15,250
Regarding?

623
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:16,750
I am a boxer.

624
00:42:16,875 --> 00:42:17,955
Do you have an appointment?

625
00:42:17,979 --> 00:42:18,104
Yes.

626
00:42:18,541 --> 00:42:19,541
Then get to the point!

627
00:42:19,791 --> 00:42:21,017
I want to play the
district tournament.

628
00:42:21,041 --> 00:42:22,201
Then meet the district coach.

629
00:42:22,458 --> 00:42:23,898
I've tried. But he
wouldn't pick me.

630
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,583
Even though I'm the best he has.

631
00:42:26,083 --> 00:42:27,375
He has banned me from the club.

632
00:42:27,875 --> 00:42:29,041
You must've broken a rule.

633
00:42:29,541 --> 00:42:30,625
No, Sir.

634
00:42:31,125 --> 00:42:32,791
I've only refused his
personal chores.

635
00:42:33,291 --> 00:42:36,083
He isn't the only selector.
- That's not true!

636
00:42:36,583 --> 00:42:38,208
He decides everything.

637
00:42:38,708 --> 00:42:39,958
If I'm selected somehow...

638
00:42:40,458 --> 00:42:41,958
he won't let me play.

639
00:42:42,458 --> 00:42:44,375
No one dares to go against him.

640
00:42:44,875 --> 00:42:46,916
He is a political
bully and a mafia.

641
00:42:47,416 --> 00:42:51,666
He lynches people to
show off his patriotism.

642
00:42:52,166 --> 00:42:55,833
Sir, boxing is all I know.

643
00:42:56,333 --> 00:42:57,750
I'm getting old.

644
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:01,708
If I don't play now I'll
never get a government job.

645
00:43:02,208 --> 00:43:07,541
All my grievances
are in this letter.

646
00:43:08,041 --> 00:43:10,458
Where do you stay?
- Next to the Railway Crossing.

647
00:43:10,958 --> 00:43:12,158
Do you have family in Banaras?

648
00:43:12,625 --> 00:43:14,291
My aunt lives there.

649
00:43:14,791 --> 00:43:16,083
Get the form signed by her.

650
00:43:16,583 --> 00:43:20,000
And go for the
Banaras selections.

651
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:23,250
Bareilly isn't the only
district in our state.

652
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:24,750
Is it allowed?

653
00:43:25,166 --> 00:43:26,208
Of course!

654
00:43:26,708 --> 00:43:28,708
With a gun to our heads,

655
00:43:29,208 --> 00:43:30,708
You shamed us to dance!

656
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:33,208
You shamed us to dance!

657
00:43:33,708 --> 00:43:35,083
You shamed us to dance!

658
00:43:35,583 --> 00:43:37,583
Smearing black ink on our faces,

659
00:43:38,083 --> 00:43:39,625
You disgraced us in a parade!

660
00:43:40,125 --> 00:43:42,000
You disgraced us in a parade!

661
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,250
You disgraced us in a parade!

662
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,416
We refuse your torment!

663
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:48,708
Our wrath will get you!

664
00:43:49,208 --> 00:43:52,833
Return our dignity, to
hell with obedience!

665
00:43:53,333 --> 00:43:56,833
Screaming to the skies,
to hell with you!

666
00:43:59,916 --> 00:44:02,666
SK Sir? Why aren't you
watching the match?

667
00:44:03,166 --> 00:44:05,791
You call that a match!

668
00:44:06,291 --> 00:44:08,916
This tournament is
a bloody farce.

669
00:44:09,416 --> 00:44:11,291
Not a single boxer in there!

670
00:44:11,791 --> 00:44:14,375
Only playing for a
bloody government job!

671
00:44:14,875 --> 00:44:18,791
Worse than mattress makers.
Only fit to beat cotton!

672
00:44:19,291 --> 00:44:21,416
They call themselves boxers!

673
00:44:21,916 --> 00:44:23,291
Tea, please?

674
00:44:23,791 --> 00:44:28,916
Man! It's freakin' insane in there!
Never seen someone box like that!

675
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:33,458
He's like a gladiator
in the colosseum!

676
00:44:33,958 --> 00:44:36,791
The spectators have their
jaws on the floor!

677
00:44:37,291 --> 00:44:40,791
C'mon! Make me a special tea.

678
00:44:41,291 --> 00:44:43,625
He's at it non stop! Bam!
Bam! Bam! Bam!

679
00:44:44,125 --> 00:44:45,333
Came out of nowhere!

680
00:44:45,833 --> 00:44:47,416
What energy! Next level.

681
00:44:47,916 --> 00:44:50,458
Insane! I've never
seen him before.

682
00:44:50,958 --> 00:44:52,416
All of a suddeny.

683
00:44:52,916 --> 00:44:56,416
Nice. Let it brew.

684
00:45:00,375 --> 00:45:01,695
Let it go. You're
making sherbet!

685
00:45:01,916 --> 00:45:03,666
Your rabid paws
scraping our gashes.

686
00:45:04,166 --> 00:45:06,125
Our dreams chomped
like sewer rats.

687
00:45:06,625 --> 00:45:08,166
Your rabid paws
scraping our gashes.

688
00:45:08,666 --> 00:45:10,125
Our dreams chomped
like sewer rats.

689
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:12,583
Those crocodile tears.

690
00:45:13,083 --> 00:45:16,666
Wolf in sheep's clothing.

691
00:45:17,166 --> 00:45:19,000
Your serpentine tongue,

692
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:23,666
Spewing sugary promises.

693
00:45:24,166 --> 00:45:25,958
Hurt us all you can,

694
00:45:26,458 --> 00:45:28,208
we'll rise and roar,

695
00:45:28,708 --> 00:45:32,166
Our wrath will get you!

696
00:45:32,666 --> 00:45:36,625
Your days are over,

697
00:45:37,125 --> 00:45:41,291
To hell with obedience!

698
00:45:41,791 --> 00:45:45,666
To hell with obedience!

699
00:45:46,166 --> 00:45:49,666
Screaming to the skies,
to hell with you!

700
00:45:54,916 --> 00:45:57,916
You've messed with
the wrong man.

701
00:45:58,416 --> 00:46:00,833
Now... first...

702
00:46:01,333 --> 00:46:05,250
forget Mike Tyson,
Muhammed Ali, Bruce Lee..

703
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:10,125
And no more brawls
and breaking bricks.

704
00:46:10,625 --> 00:46:12,458
Keep your hands safe...

705
00:46:12,958 --> 00:46:17,708
Second... you won't be playing
these amateurs at state level.

706
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:19,625
The competition
will be fierce...

707
00:46:20,125 --> 00:46:21,485
and we don't have time to prep.

708
00:46:21,916 --> 00:46:27,291
Go home... wrap up unfinished
business and come back to me.

709
00:46:27,791 --> 00:46:30,671
What are you looking at? - Wondering
what's so mesmerising about this...

710
00:46:30,695 --> 00:46:34,291
that he gave up his education..
Brawled and went to jail for!

711
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:37,333
Neither can you eat
or drink out of it...

712
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:41,708
nor can I use it to
hammer anything.

713
00:46:42,208 --> 00:46:44,000
Useless shit!

714
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,208
Lift up the lid...

715
00:46:46,708 --> 00:46:49,750
It's multipurpose... blocks
all kinds of diarrohea...

716
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:51,416
Verbal and Anal!

717
00:46:51,916 --> 00:46:54,416
And wash it after every use...
to prevent hemorrhoids.

718
00:46:54,916 --> 00:46:56,833
What is your problem!

719
00:46:57,333 --> 00:46:59,333
At least I'm trying!

720
00:46:59,833 --> 00:47:02,416
Not loafing around like
the neighbourhood boys.

721
00:47:02,916 --> 00:47:06,083
College could have...
- I couldn't! Don't you get it?

722
00:47:06,583 --> 00:47:11,083
I couldn't focus! I'm brainless!
Shoot me!

723
00:47:11,583 --> 00:47:13,458
It's genetics...

724
00:47:13,958 --> 00:47:17,583
it's your DNA in me..

725
00:47:18,083 --> 00:47:19,125
Were YOU a genius?

726
00:47:19,625 --> 00:47:21,750
I'm asking you!
Were you a genius?

727
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:24,166
Was mom a genius?

728
00:47:24,666 --> 00:47:26,416
When the two of you
echo stupidity...

729
00:47:26,916 --> 00:47:29,375
how do you expect me
to be Aryabhatt.?

730
00:47:29,875 --> 00:47:31,250
Just ignore him...

731
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:32,750
How do I ignore...

732
00:47:33,166 --> 00:47:34,166
the shit he spews!

733
00:47:34,583 --> 00:47:35,083
Forgive him!

734
00:47:35,583 --> 00:47:38,416
You know it very well I don't
have brains for academics...

735
00:47:38,916 --> 00:47:40,000
It's all greek to me.

736
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,166
This is all I know...

737
00:47:42,666 --> 00:47:49,541
Either I become a boxer or be a brawler...
choose one!

738
00:47:50,041 --> 00:47:53,791
Tendulkar was 15 when he started
to play cricket for India..

739
00:47:54,291 --> 00:47:58,291
If he had you for a father...

740
00:47:58,791 --> 00:48:02,750
then who'd be selling
half the products on TV?

741
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:05,250
There is something
called destiny!

742
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:08,208
What greatness
have you achieved?

743
00:48:08,708 --> 00:48:10,666
What glory have you
bestowed upon this world!

744
00:48:11,166 --> 00:48:13,566
At least I won a cup which can't
be used to hammer things...

745
00:48:13,875 --> 00:48:15,275
- Ok... Stop it now!
- Yes I will...

746
00:48:15,299 --> 00:48:16,299
Go fix your hand...

747
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:19,833
That's exactly what I was doing
before he started on me...

748
00:48:20,333 --> 00:48:23,458
This is my passion! Do
you understand passion?

749
00:48:23,958 --> 00:48:26,916
You don't... You need
brains for that!

750
00:48:27,416 --> 00:48:29,250
You please shut up!

751
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:31,958
Lectures me about fashion...

752
00:48:32,458 --> 00:48:34,708
Interested in fashion? Earn
your own money for it!

753
00:48:35,208 --> 00:48:38,708
FASHION! It's his Fashion...

754
00:48:44,333 --> 00:48:46,833
Don't let dad get to you.

755
00:48:47,333 --> 00:48:49,458
He's generally frustrated...

756
00:48:49,958 --> 00:48:51,583
You ignore him...

757
00:48:52,083 --> 00:48:53,833
I'll cheer him up!

758
00:48:54,333 --> 00:48:58,583
I'll get such good grades that
he'll be comparatively happy...

759
00:48:59,083 --> 00:49:00,541
You just box...

760
00:49:01,041 --> 00:49:03,583
You should've been my father.

761
00:49:04,083 --> 00:49:05,833
- May I say something...
- Yeah.

762
00:49:06,333 --> 00:49:07,958
You know why dad's upset?

763
00:49:08,458 --> 00:49:14,208
Someone saw you on a date with a
girl somewhere and told him...

764
00:49:14,708 --> 00:49:17,416
You didn't mention
it at home either.

765
00:49:17,916 --> 00:49:20,250
He would've lost his mind...

766
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:24,458
if I'd told him that she is
mute and is from another caste.

767
00:49:24,958 --> 00:49:25,958
She is mute?!

768
00:49:26,041 --> 00:49:27,833
Yes... since birth...

769
00:49:28,333 --> 00:49:30,291
You know our voice-box?

770
00:49:30,791 --> 00:49:31,833
Larynx?

771
00:49:32,333 --> 00:49:34,583
Yes that.. it's empty.

772
00:49:35,083 --> 00:49:38,625
She can hear...
just can't speak.

773
00:49:39,125 --> 00:49:41,625
But she is so beautiful...
you'll see!

774
00:49:42,125 --> 00:49:44,708
So when do I meet her?
- I barely meet her myself...

775
00:49:45,208 --> 00:49:47,166
She insists on getting
married first...

776
00:49:47,666 --> 00:49:51,125
You need to learn to
show your affection!

777
00:49:51,625 --> 00:49:54,666
She sees it all! Her
eyes are cinemascope.

778
00:49:55,166 --> 00:49:58,458
That may be... but have you
ever gifted her anything?

779
00:49:58,958 --> 00:50:01,833
- Like?
- Flowers or something?

780
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:05,625
Are you crazy? I'm
always broke...

781
00:50:06,125 --> 00:50:09,625
You're a bum! Come with me.

782
00:50:26,125 --> 00:50:27,958
Damn! You look stunning!

783
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:31,958
Let's take a selfie?

784
00:50:34,916 --> 00:50:36,166
Do this.

785
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:40,166
You're supposed to...

786
00:50:53,416 --> 00:50:57,000
What?

787
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:01,000
Time?

788
00:51:04,958 --> 00:51:08,458
They're on a pilgrimage...

789
00:51:11,416 --> 00:51:14,916
Wait... I'll check.

790
00:51:25,125 --> 00:51:29,041
His grandma dreamt of the goddess.
So they... listen!

791
00:51:29,541 --> 00:51:33,375
They had a morning train...
couldn't have missed it.

792
00:51:33,875 --> 00:51:34,916
Did you miss your train?

793
00:51:35,416 --> 00:51:36,416
Bro... you're inside?

794
00:51:36,583 --> 00:51:37,833
Yes... with Sunaina!

795
00:51:38,333 --> 00:51:40,750
Grandma got nauseous so
we had to turn around...

796
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:42,690
Should we get out
through the back?

797
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:45,125
You need to open the front door for us..
Let her leave!

798
00:51:45,625 --> 00:51:47,833
Okay... wait!

799
00:51:48,333 --> 00:51:51,833
Sunaina... Oh damn!

800
00:52:09,625 --> 00:52:11,041
Coach Sanjay Kumar? - Yes.

801
00:52:11,541 --> 00:52:15,041
This way...

802
00:52:20,125 --> 00:52:21,875
Greetings.

803
00:52:22,375 --> 00:52:24,875
Have a seat.

804
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:26,583
We've seen your list...

805
00:52:27,083 --> 00:52:27,458
Yes.

806
00:52:27,958 --> 00:52:30,208
You've selected a Shravan
Singh I believe.

807
00:52:30,708 --> 00:52:32,166
Your name is Sanjay Kumar?

808
00:52:32,666 --> 00:52:34,416
Yes.

809
00:52:34,916 --> 00:52:38,416
Your last name?

810
00:52:40,583 --> 00:52:41,583
I don't have one...

811
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:45,250
What caste are you? Priests?
Warriors? or Traders?

812
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:56,250
The fourth... which you didn't mention...
'The Untouchables'.

813
00:53:02,916 --> 00:53:06,416
Waiter...

814
00:53:12,083 --> 00:53:15,791
Get water in a
separate jug for him.

815
00:53:16,291 --> 00:53:19,916
Shravan is a great boxer.
He's from your town.

816
00:53:20,416 --> 00:53:21,576
He has great respect for you.

817
00:53:21,875 --> 00:53:27,625
I know how much he respects me.

818
00:53:28,125 --> 00:53:31,625
And I also know how
much you respect me...

819
00:53:36,333 --> 00:53:39,458
I may have retired...

820
00:53:39,958 --> 00:53:47,708
but my glutes are still
as strong as steel...

821
00:53:48,208 --> 00:53:50,791
you can't break them...

822
00:53:51,291 --> 00:53:55,375
you can however... lick them.

823
00:53:55,875 --> 00:54:01,458
Use your words to kiss my ass...

824
00:54:01,958 --> 00:54:06,875
and if you can't do that...

825
00:54:07,375 --> 00:54:12,416
then shut up entirely.

826
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:18,375
Shravan Singh is the best
boxer in our team and town...

827
00:54:18,875 --> 00:54:22,791
None of my boys can beat him.

828
00:54:23,291 --> 00:54:31,291
Despite that... he'll never play
even at the district level...

829
00:54:31,791 --> 00:54:35,833
that was my promise to him.

830
00:54:36,333 --> 00:54:37,533
You are breaking that promise.

831
00:54:37,916 --> 00:54:43,125
I know he knocked you
out in your own house.

832
00:54:43,625 --> 00:54:45,541
Didn't he?

833
00:54:46,041 --> 00:54:50,416
He told me... you
made him run errands.

834
00:54:50,916 --> 00:54:57,041
- Which guru doesn't demand this?
- I don't.

835
00:54:57,541 --> 00:54:59,125
They are sportsmen...
not servants...

836
00:54:59,625 --> 00:55:02,958
and didn't he just
declare him the best?

837
00:55:03,458 --> 00:55:06,083
Why did he ruin two prime
years of his 'best'?

838
00:55:06,583 --> 00:55:09,416
For discipline. -You
call this discipline?

839
00:55:09,916 --> 00:55:13,416
Cooking... doing the laundry...
cleaning the toilet..

840
00:55:20,416 --> 00:55:25,291
Pump him up with all the
testosterone you've got...

841
00:55:25,791 --> 00:55:28,750
Let's take it up in the ring.

842
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:31,875
But remember...

843
00:55:32,375 --> 00:55:35,041
When a boxer is knocked out...

844
00:55:35,541 --> 00:55:39,041
it's the coach who bleeds.

845
00:55:50,416 --> 00:55:53,916
Goodbye!

846
00:56:00,958 --> 00:56:03,791
This one...

847
00:56:04,291 --> 00:56:05,291
I should go now.

848
00:56:05,458 --> 00:56:08,958
I promise... we'll get
married this year.

849
00:56:16,833 --> 00:56:20,333
It's time... you carry on.

850
00:56:24,083 --> 00:56:27,166
Do you know why I
love you so much?

851
00:56:27,666 --> 00:56:32,625
You were the first person
who was honest with me...

852
00:56:33,125 --> 00:56:37,416
I really wanted to study further...
but no one allowed me.

853
00:56:37,916 --> 00:56:41,916
I can't speak... so I've
been ignored all my life.

854
00:56:42,416 --> 00:56:45,791
The only hope I'm holding
onto is your promise...

855
00:56:46,291 --> 00:56:52,208
that you'd even give up boxing if needed...
to fulfill my dreams.

856
00:56:52,708 --> 00:56:56,333
I've been waiting a long time...
this is the only year we've got.

857
00:56:56,833 --> 00:56:59,083
I can't fight anymore...

858
00:56:59,583 --> 00:57:00,791
I want to study further...

859
00:57:01,291 --> 00:57:05,458
see the world with you...
come what may!

860
00:57:05,958 --> 00:57:09,458
I'll visit you in Banaras.

861
00:57:21,083 --> 00:57:22,083
Listen...

862
00:57:22,416 --> 00:57:25,916
the neighbours had sent
too much of lamb biryani.

863
00:57:26,416 --> 00:57:27,916
Pack it up for my boxers.

864
00:57:28,416 --> 00:57:31,791
The Federation's meals aren't
even enough for a chess player.

865
00:57:32,291 --> 00:57:35,875
What's with...

866
00:57:36,375 --> 00:57:38,166
My mistress scratched it.

867
00:57:38,666 --> 00:57:42,833
Out to conquer the world with your
certificate of your excellence...

868
00:57:43,333 --> 00:57:45,458
You'll fall face first.

869
00:57:45,958 --> 00:57:50,166
First learn how to kiss ass...

870
00:57:50,666 --> 00:57:53,791
For what's more important
is whose back you scratch

871
00:57:54,291 --> 00:57:55,291
and whose ass you wipe.

872
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:58,125
Sir... Shravan Kumar
Singh from Bareilly..

873
00:57:58,625 --> 00:58:00,541
Whose woman you serve...

874
00:58:01,041 --> 00:58:03,291
If a millionaire damsel would
bounce her tits for you.

875
00:58:03,791 --> 00:58:05,071
I've offered it to the Ganges...

876
00:58:05,375 --> 00:58:09,583
will grow it back
if one of you wins.

877
00:58:10,083 --> 00:58:12,958
Learn to play...
Play to learn...

878
00:58:13,458 --> 00:58:15,708
Boxing is stamina over strength.

879
00:58:16,208 --> 00:58:17,688
Three rounds of three
minutes each...

880
00:58:17,916 --> 00:58:20,041
Speed and stamina are essential.

881
00:58:20,541 --> 00:58:24,166
You'll all swim across the river...
Let's go.

882
00:58:24,666 --> 00:58:29,250
Learn to play...
Play to learn...

883
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:32,083
Learn to play... Life's Gambit..

884
00:58:32,583 --> 00:58:34,791
Play to learn... Life's Gambit.

885
00:58:35,291 --> 00:58:39,708
Break the rules... bend the grit.
Keep them fooled.. don't commit.

886
00:58:40,208 --> 00:58:42,458
Learn to play... Life's Gambit..

887
00:58:42,958 --> 00:58:45,083
Play to learn... Life's Gambit.

888
00:58:45,583 --> 00:58:50,000
Break the rules... bend the grit.
Keep them fooled.. don't commit.

889
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:52,791
Whose boots will you lick?
Whose fetch will you stick?

890
00:58:53,291 --> 00:58:55,531
Whom shall you wank? Or will
you pound him like a tank?

891
00:58:55,916 --> 00:58:58,166
This way or that...
Plausible or rad...

892
00:58:58,666 --> 00:59:00,583
Cash in on the chance unclad.

893
00:59:01,083 --> 00:59:02,791
Keep rollin' on...
Don't be a minority...

894
00:59:03,291 --> 00:59:05,333
Do what you want toto
hell with the authority.

895
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:06,993
You'll be the buzz of town...

896
00:59:07,416 --> 00:59:08,916
Be a hero or a clown.

897
00:59:09,416 --> 00:59:10,416
Why are you grinning?

898
00:59:10,791 --> 00:59:12,125
Didn't you see?

899
00:59:12,625 --> 00:59:13,666
You lost!

900
00:59:14,166 --> 00:59:18,125
Lost? My punch was so strong!
The pain won't let him sleep!

901
00:59:18,625 --> 00:59:20,625
You still have the
brain of a mule.

902
00:59:21,125 --> 00:59:22,485
He landed more
punches than you...

903
00:59:22,791 --> 00:59:24,416
which means he
scored more points.

904
00:59:24,916 --> 00:59:25,916
So?

905
00:59:26,333 --> 00:59:27,333
I have warrior's blood.

906
00:59:27,833 --> 00:59:30,083
I can take a punch just as
strongly as I can land one.

907
00:59:30,583 --> 00:59:32,916
I'll show you... Watch!

908
00:59:33,416 --> 00:59:35,666
Everyone has a guarantee.

909
00:59:36,166 --> 00:59:37,791
Even I had a chance.

910
00:59:38,291 --> 00:59:40,291
But I missed it...

911
00:59:40,791 --> 00:59:42,231
all thanks to
moralality bulls♪♪♪

912
00:59:42,291 --> 00:59:43,833
When the punch comes
from the right...

913
00:59:44,333 --> 00:59:45,893
dodge it, move left
and let it slip.

914
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:47,893
Then... a left hook...
bob and weave...

915
00:59:48,333 --> 00:59:49,653
Left to right...
right to left...

916
00:59:49,916 --> 00:59:52,000
like your mother used to knit.

917
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:54,333
We made it with old
tyres and tubes...

918
00:59:54,833 --> 00:59:58,458
because the funds released by the
boxing federation were either used...

919
00:59:58,958 --> 01:00:01,083
by the officials to
buy a holiday-home...

920
01:00:01,583 --> 01:00:06,166
or a sparkle for
his wife's finger.

921
01:00:06,666 --> 01:00:09,875
Your false 'Warrior' pride
will never let you learn.

922
01:00:10,375 --> 01:00:11,375
What's my mistake?

923
01:00:11,791 --> 01:00:14,291
A jab coming from the
elbow has no strength.

924
01:00:14,791 --> 01:00:17,208
A superhero throwing random
punches looks good in cinema...

925
01:00:17,684 --> 01:00:19,684
Let the power come from the ground ..
Up your feet.

926
01:00:19,708 --> 01:00:21,508
Through your stomach
into your shoulder...

927
01:00:21,666 --> 01:00:22,666
and then throw the punch.

928
01:00:23,125 --> 01:00:24,565
The monkey, the snake
and the cat...

929
01:00:24,791 --> 01:00:26,791
Watch them keenly!

930
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:29,416
Dodge like a monkey...
attack like a snake..

931
01:00:29,916 --> 01:00:31,236
"Do bad, and you'll
have it all."

932
01:00:31,291 --> 01:00:32,411
"Do good, and you lose all."

933
01:00:32,583 --> 01:00:34,663
"Turn your life into hell,
then dream about heaven."

934
01:00:35,125 --> 01:00:37,285
In the end, all is one Burn
the books, hold the gun...

935
01:00:37,708 --> 01:00:40,108
Cock the hammer, have some fun
Point blank - kill someone...

936
01:00:40,291 --> 01:00:42,416
Throw the life for a toss
One who wins is the boss...

937
01:00:42,916 --> 01:00:45,156
Nail the law - on the Cross.
Sell the country at a loss.

938
01:00:45,541 --> 01:00:46,621
Who to read or to follow...

939
01:00:46,958 --> 01:00:48,198
Who'll lead us to the gallow...

940
01:00:48,291 --> 01:00:49,651
Next one in line
Satan with halo..

941
01:00:49,675 --> 01:00:51,000
Everything is planned now...

942
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:53,900
Whom to lynch, whom to rape and
which one's to be banned now.

943
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:56,443
Don't call thyself a man now.
We bring the fight again now.

944
01:00:56,467 --> 01:01:00,583
Learn to play, Life's gambit
Play to Learn, life's gambit.

945
01:01:01,083 --> 01:01:04,583
Crank the tool, throw a fit...
School's over... do that shit.

946
01:01:26,666 --> 01:01:27,958
Looking for space for Vatika.

947
01:01:28,458 --> 01:01:30,166
Can you show me.

948
01:01:30,666 --> 01:01:34,541
He's looking for the cafe
we're coming from...

949
01:01:35,041 --> 01:01:36,791
I can't understand
either one of you..

950
01:01:37,291 --> 01:01:39,333
Sorry brother... no English!

951
01:01:39,833 --> 01:01:42,041
I know sign language.

952
01:01:42,541 --> 01:01:46,541
Yes. I know.

953
01:01:47,041 --> 01:01:49,333
So you can hear?

954
01:01:49,833 --> 01:01:53,333
Can you take me to the
place called Vatika.

955
01:01:58,583 --> 01:01:59,583
Who are you looking for?

956
01:01:59,916 --> 01:02:01,416
Waiting for someone?

957
01:02:01,916 --> 01:02:02,916
No..

958
01:02:02,958 --> 01:02:04,678
Did you not just waste
two hours with her?

959
01:02:04,702 --> 01:02:07,416
She said... she'll be back soon.

960
01:02:07,916 --> 01:02:09,666
Go to her...

961
01:02:10,166 --> 01:02:14,833
Get the hell out of here!

962
01:02:15,333 --> 01:02:16,541
Come an hour early tomorrow...

963
01:02:17,041 --> 01:02:18,750
I'll show you how to romance.

964
01:02:19,250 --> 01:02:22,750
The horny youth of this country
is the reason of it's sad state..

965
01:02:28,958 --> 01:02:30,541
Sunaina...

966
01:02:31,041 --> 01:02:32,875
You told me you'll
be back soon...

967
01:02:33,375 --> 01:02:34,775
I was waiting for
you at the gym...

968
01:02:34,916 --> 01:02:36,396
and you're here
flirting with him.

969
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:37,500
What's wrong with you?

970
01:02:37,708 --> 01:02:39,916
I know he is a
fair-skinned foreigner...

971
01:02:40,416 --> 01:02:42,096
didn't take you long
to start drooling.

972
01:02:42,416 --> 01:02:43,458
Excuse me.

973
01:02:43,958 --> 01:02:47,458
Get lost.

974
01:03:05,291 --> 01:03:09,208
Sorry.

975
01:03:09,708 --> 01:03:14,541
Go to hell!

976
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:17,416
You're like my uncle!

977
01:03:17,916 --> 01:03:22,333
Don't talk to me.
All men are jerks!

978
01:03:22,833 --> 01:03:27,333
They put women on a leash and...
treat them like slaves.

979
01:03:27,833 --> 01:03:31,333
Don't ever call me again.

980
01:03:45,625 --> 01:03:46,625
Hello Sir..

981
01:03:46,916 --> 01:03:50,416
The foreigner that I hit?
Where does he live?

982
01:04:04,833 --> 01:04:07,583
Mr. English...

983
01:04:08,083 --> 01:04:11,583
I am sorry bro...

984
01:04:16,708 --> 01:04:20,208
Come on.

985
01:04:32,291 --> 01:04:34,583
Isn't our tournament here?

986
01:04:35,083 --> 01:04:37,125
Minister is having a
family wedding, instead...

987
01:04:37,625 --> 01:04:41,125
Now?

988
01:04:47,583 --> 01:04:49,916
69.150.

989
01:04:50,416 --> 01:04:51,875
Loose the undies...

990
01:04:52,375 --> 01:04:56,416
Drop your undies down!

991
01:04:56,916 --> 01:04:58,250
Should've waited!

992
01:04:58,750 --> 01:05:01,416
For me to pull them off
and wave it like a flag.

993
01:05:01,916 --> 01:05:04,250
69.

994
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:05,041
Weight approved.

995
01:05:05,541 --> 01:05:06,791
This ain't right!

996
01:05:07,291 --> 01:05:09,171
Thus commences the State
Boxing Championship...

997
01:05:09,583 --> 01:05:11,625
sponsored by
'Spotless' Detergent.

998
01:05:12,125 --> 01:05:14,375
In this exciting
game of boxing...

999
01:05:14,875 --> 01:05:18,708
we've three rounds of
three minutes each...

1000
01:05:19,208 --> 01:05:22,041
After each round...

1001
01:05:22,541 --> 01:05:23,041
That's nice.

1002
01:05:23,541 --> 01:05:25,083
Trying to get to the waist.

1003
01:05:25,583 --> 01:05:29,291
Stop the match...
Minister Sir is here.

1004
01:05:29,791 --> 01:05:31,875
Our dear Minister Sir is here...
all rise!

1005
01:05:32,375 --> 01:05:33,875
Our great state...

1006
01:05:34,375 --> 01:05:36,458
land of Hockey Legends...

1007
01:05:36,958 --> 01:05:40,291
of Cricketing Legends...

1008
01:05:40,791 --> 01:05:44,458
home to great Wrestlers
and Shooters...

1009
01:05:44,958 --> 01:05:48,458
home to great Mohammed Ali.

1010
01:05:53,083 --> 01:05:54,958
My apologies...

1011
01:05:55,458 --> 01:05:59,083
Mohammed Ali was
from South India.

1012
01:05:59,583 --> 01:06:03,625
Since Minister Sir was late... we
are now re-starting the match...

1013
01:06:04,125 --> 01:06:07,916
And once again we commence
State Boxing Championship...

1014
01:06:08,416 --> 01:06:11,916
presented by
'Spotless' Detergent.

1015
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:21,041
Anyone can tell that he is
over-weight in the category.

1016
01:06:21,541 --> 01:06:25,416
It doesn't matter who's what...
you'll still be 'untouchable'.

1017
01:06:25,916 --> 01:06:28,291
The federation has
empowered me...

1018
01:06:28,791 --> 01:06:30,250
to do... whatever I want.

1019
01:06:30,750 --> 01:06:34,250
Your boy will have to fight
many over-weights to win.

1020
01:06:41,708 --> 01:06:43,228
Bhagwan Sir is playing
a dirty game...

1021
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:46,208
He's put all the seasoned
boxers against Shravan...

1022
01:06:46,708 --> 01:06:48,228
The matches were to
be held indoors...

1023
01:06:48,708 --> 01:06:51,541
but the sports' minister occupied
it for the family wedding.

1024
01:06:52,041 --> 01:06:54,916
I re-organised it with my own money...
haven't misused your funds.

1025
01:06:55,416 --> 01:06:58,208
A Boxing Film in India
has more spectators...

1026
01:06:58,708 --> 01:07:01,416
than an actual
Boxing Tournament.

1027
01:07:01,916 --> 01:07:09,916
What amazing footwork
by the one in blue...

1028
01:07:10,875 --> 01:07:12,315
It's a complete
display of strength.

1029
01:07:12,416 --> 01:07:13,416
Using his full strength.

1030
01:07:13,666 --> 01:07:17,000
And slowly overpowering
his opponent.

1031
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:17,708
But...

1032
01:07:18,208 --> 01:07:23,541
It seems like entire city
is with Shravan Kumar.

1033
01:07:24,041 --> 01:07:27,208
Both the boxers trying hard...

1034
01:07:27,708 --> 01:07:28,041
Stop!

1035
01:07:28,541 --> 01:07:29,875
Why are you chasing a knockout?

1036
01:07:30,375 --> 01:07:31,375
Score those points!

1037
01:07:31,708 --> 01:07:33,125
I can easily get a Knock Out.

1038
01:07:33,625 --> 01:07:35,458
You can't beat him
with your strength...

1039
01:07:35,958 --> 01:07:37,875
Tire him out... Okay?

1040
01:07:38,375 --> 01:07:39,375
Keep a cool head.

1041
01:07:39,625 --> 01:07:42,166
Shravan Kumar Singh.

1042
01:07:42,666 --> 01:07:45,833
And our very own son of Bareily,
Keeps making comebacks.

1043
01:07:46,333 --> 01:07:48,708
But Shravan Kumar Singh
is a atheletic Sportsman.

1044
01:07:49,208 --> 01:07:52,958
Making him run around and
scoring points our winner...

1045
01:07:53,458 --> 01:07:58,041
Shravan Kumar Singh.

1046
01:07:58,541 --> 01:08:01,916
This steroid
empowers the bull...

1047
01:08:02,416 --> 01:08:04,458
to romp with a hundred cows.

1048
01:08:04,958 --> 01:08:08,375
All I want is to see
Shravan knocked out...

1049
01:08:08,875 --> 01:08:12,708
so hard that he
gives up on Boxing.

1050
01:08:13,208 --> 01:08:16,708
Then watch me make you
the next Indian Champ.

1051
01:08:24,041 --> 01:08:25,801
I didn't need to see the
evidence to know...

1052
01:08:25,833 --> 01:08:26,833
how we play sports.

1053
01:08:26,916 --> 01:08:27,916
To wake you...

1054
01:08:28,375 --> 01:08:28,875
to warn you...

1055
01:08:29,375 --> 01:08:31,458
Bhagwan Sir is
over-dosing Balbir...

1056
01:08:31,958 --> 01:08:35,458
Wow...

1057
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:41,180
Bhagwan Das has turned
him into a monster.

1058
01:08:41,666 --> 01:08:46,041
He'll maul Shravan in the game.

1059
01:08:46,541 --> 01:08:47,541
Where is my Vaseline?!

1060
01:08:47,916 --> 01:08:48,956
Someone stole my Vaseline.

1061
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:51,458
Bro... They're even
stealing the undies.

1062
01:08:51,958 --> 01:08:53,198
Every steroid has a dose-limit.

1063
01:08:53,583 --> 01:08:57,208
And it seems like they're
pumping him with far too much.

1064
01:08:57,708 --> 01:08:59,125
His lungs will be under stress.

1065
01:08:59,625 --> 01:09:01,875
He'll be breathless...
take advantage of that..

1066
01:09:02,375 --> 01:09:06,416
First round... Let him feel
you're easy to beat...

1067
01:09:06,916 --> 01:09:09,708
let him use up his stamina
and when he's spent...

1068
01:09:10,208 --> 01:09:13,625
go for the kill!

1069
01:09:14,125 --> 01:09:15,645
Shravan, you can
basically see that...

1070
01:09:15,875 --> 01:09:17,041
he's tiring out Balbir.

1071
01:09:17,541 --> 01:09:18,941
He's efforts are
to make him tired.

1072
01:09:19,416 --> 01:09:21,000
So that he uses up
all his energy.

1073
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:23,875
That's a boxing
stratergy, and...

1074
01:09:24,375 --> 01:09:26,335
both the boxers are showing
lot of enthusiasm.

1075
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:30,000
And also very experienced.

1076
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:33,375
He's on forward defense,
covering himself.

1077
01:09:33,875 --> 01:09:35,833
Balbir is on attacking.

1078
01:09:36,333 --> 01:09:38,666
But once again Shravan using
The same stratergy...

1079
01:09:39,166 --> 01:09:40,666
trying to tire him out.

1080
01:09:41,166 --> 01:09:42,458
Evading Shravan's punches.

1081
01:09:42,958 --> 01:09:44,125
Water!

1082
01:09:44,625 --> 01:09:45,625
It'll make you bloat...

1083
01:09:46,125 --> 01:09:49,625
keep that bottle away.

1084
01:09:51,601 --> 01:09:52,601
Shravan.

1085
01:09:52,625 --> 01:09:56,916
Once again.

1086
01:09:57,416 --> 01:09:58,458
Stop.

1087
01:09:58,958 --> 01:10:01,750
One.

1088
01:10:02,250 --> 01:10:03,250
Two.

1089
01:10:03,708 --> 01:10:04,833
Get up.

1090
01:10:05,333 --> 01:10:07,916
Four.

1091
01:10:08,416 --> 01:10:10,458
Get up.

1092
01:10:10,958 --> 01:10:14,458
What are you looking at? Get up!

1093
01:10:14,958 --> 01:10:16,708
Six.

1094
01:10:17,208 --> 01:10:17,583
Get up!

1095
01:10:18,083 --> 01:10:21,125
Seven.

1096
01:10:21,625 --> 01:10:24,208
And once again Shravan Kumar...

1097
01:10:24,708 --> 01:10:28,208
makes a come back.

1098
01:11:16,750 --> 01:11:18,208
And once again
Balbir's knocked out.

1099
01:11:18,708 --> 01:11:20,666
Balbir from Ghaziabad...

1100
01:11:21,166 --> 01:11:24,833
has been knocked out
by the son of Beneras.

1101
01:11:25,333 --> 01:11:26,916
Let's see if he can get up.

1102
01:11:27,416 --> 01:11:28,708
Or not.

1103
01:11:29,208 --> 01:11:30,750
Six.

1104
01:11:31,250 --> 01:11:32,333
The counting has begun.

1105
01:11:32,833 --> 01:11:36,333
Eight. Nine. Ten.

1106
01:12:06,458 --> 01:12:07,541
Mr. Shravan...

1107
01:12:08,041 --> 01:12:09,958
Mind if I put your photo
in the local paper?

1108
01:12:10,458 --> 01:12:11,938
I need to write a
five line report...

1109
01:12:12,375 --> 01:12:13,375
as per Bhagwan Sir.

1110
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:16,708
A photo in the paper would
convince my Father-in-law...

1111
01:12:17,208 --> 01:12:18,625
he might think this is fake.

1112
01:12:19,125 --> 01:12:20,125
Take my picture.

1113
01:12:20,375 --> 01:12:20,875
Sure... give it.

1114
01:12:21,375 --> 01:12:23,416
Take it...

1115
01:12:23,916 --> 01:12:24,916
Don't you have a camera?

1116
01:12:25,416 --> 01:12:27,708
I've a passport size photo.

1117
01:12:28,208 --> 01:12:31,708
- Have one?
- Here!

1118
01:12:51,708 --> 01:12:55,208
What are you doing?

1119
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:10,666
Your cherry is yet to ripen...

1120
01:13:11,166 --> 01:13:14,291
Your lips of love...

1121
01:13:14,791 --> 01:13:18,541
Your lips of love
are yet untouched.

1122
01:13:19,041 --> 01:13:20,625
At three, we shall...

1123
01:13:21,125 --> 01:13:24,583
At three, we shall...

1124
01:13:25,083 --> 01:13:28,583
In the quiet of day-break
We shall pound the duck.

1125
01:13:29,083 --> 01:13:32,583
At three, we shall...

1126
01:13:47,250 --> 01:13:49,166
Come on.

1127
01:13:49,666 --> 01:13:51,166
Go on then.

1128
01:13:51,666 --> 01:13:53,583
I am, how much more?

1129
01:13:54,083 --> 01:13:57,041
Come on.

1130
01:13:57,541 --> 01:14:05,166
The long handle is stuck...

1131
01:14:05,666 --> 01:14:08,458
and the bastard doesn't pluck.

1132
01:14:08,958 --> 01:14:10,541
At three, we shall...

1133
01:14:11,041 --> 01:14:14,541
In the quiet of day-break
We shall pound the duck.

1134
01:14:15,041 --> 01:14:16,041
At three, we shall...

1135
01:14:16,083 --> 01:14:18,458
Did he get me
pregnant or did you?

1136
01:14:18,958 --> 01:14:21,083
Why should I ask him?

1137
01:14:21,583 --> 01:14:23,708
As it is... we're his puppets.

1138
01:14:24,208 --> 01:14:28,041
We eat what he says, when he says...
sleep when he says..

1139
01:14:28,541 --> 01:14:32,000
Can we decide, for once?

1140
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:34,041
Who else will you fight for?

1141
01:14:34,541 --> 01:14:35,875
She's our only child...

1142
01:14:36,375 --> 01:14:41,791
and this is your only chance
to prove your worth to her.

1143
01:14:42,291 --> 01:14:45,791
At three, we shall...

1144
01:14:53,958 --> 01:14:57,208
Oi sweetheart, your
band's playing.

1145
01:14:57,708 --> 01:15:01,458
Golden bride is delaying.

1146
01:15:01,958 --> 01:15:05,291
Oi sweetheart, your
band's playing.

1147
01:15:05,791 --> 01:15:11,375
Golden bride is delaying.

1148
01:15:11,875 --> 01:15:15,375
Aunty, how about a token.

1149
01:15:17,625 --> 01:15:21,125
Every sprain, ask for a rub...

1150
01:15:26,041 --> 01:15:29,541
Keep your Boxer flexed,
make sure he drubs.

1151
01:15:33,750 --> 01:15:36,230
If he doesn't, pound you hard
then let him go for a pilgrimage.

1152
01:15:36,708 --> 01:15:38,375
It was her decision...

1153
01:15:38,875 --> 01:15:39,125
What can I do?

1154
01:15:39,625 --> 01:15:42,250
She's your daughter...
isn't she?

1155
01:15:42,750 --> 01:15:45,375
How can a woman decide!

1156
01:15:45,875 --> 01:15:51,458
When have women had any
say in our family!

1157
01:15:51,958 --> 01:15:55,750
In 'your' family!
- If she marries that boy...

1158
01:15:56,250 --> 01:16:00,375
You'll kill us all?

1159
01:16:00,875 --> 01:16:05,000
Why don't you get
it into your head?

1160
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:08,875
I am Bhagwan Das Mishra!

1161
01:16:09,375 --> 01:16:10,916
We're Brahmins...
the highest caste.

1162
01:16:11,416 --> 01:16:14,416
And a Brahmin girl is
marrying a Rajput.

1163
01:16:14,916 --> 01:16:20,125
A Rajput whose
purity is doubtful.

1164
01:16:20,625 --> 01:16:25,458
Many lower castes change their last
name to pass off as higher caste.

1165
01:16:25,958 --> 01:16:29,000
That 'Spotless' Detergent guy...

1166
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:30,620
wasn't he a lower caste?

1167
01:16:30,791 --> 01:16:32,958
Are you aware of
how wealthy he is?

1168
01:16:33,458 --> 01:16:38,375
If his wealth makes him
worthy of a Brahmin...

1169
01:16:38,875 --> 01:16:41,708
then my lack of wealth...

1170
01:16:42,208 --> 01:16:45,708
makes this marriage perfect.

1171
01:16:57,250 --> 01:17:00,750
No one will attend this wedding.

1172
01:17:03,125 --> 01:17:06,625
Go back inside!

1173
01:17:18,166 --> 01:17:23,166
No one has ever dared
to dishonour me...

1174
01:17:23,666 --> 01:17:27,166
but today... you've done that.

1175
01:17:30,375 --> 01:17:34,125
I shall never forget this.

1176
01:17:34,625 --> 01:17:37,458
You are dead to me.

1177
01:17:37,958 --> 01:17:40,958
"The water will come at 3:30."

1178
01:17:41,458 --> 01:17:43,333
"3:30."

1179
01:17:43,833 --> 01:17:47,333
"3:30."

1180
01:17:47,833 --> 01:17:51,000
"3:30."

1181
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:55,000
"The water will come at 3:30."

1182
01:17:59,541 --> 01:18:03,291
Where's the father of the bride?

1183
01:18:03,791 --> 01:18:07,958
What's in your mouth?

1184
01:18:08,458 --> 01:18:13,333
Look! Bride's father is here.

1185
01:18:13,833 --> 01:18:15,208
Please come, sir!

1186
01:18:15,708 --> 01:18:16,166
Please sit!

1187
01:18:16,666 --> 01:18:20,166
Hey! Make space.

1188
01:18:27,083 --> 01:18:30,583
Please continue.

1189
01:19:27,416 --> 01:19:29,708
- Tea!
- Thank you.

1190
01:19:30,208 --> 01:19:33,083
Tea?

1191
01:19:33,583 --> 01:19:35,250
Wake him! It's his
first day at work.

1192
01:19:35,750 --> 01:19:36,833
Let him sleep.

1193
01:19:37,333 --> 01:19:40,833
I'll get tea for you.

1194
01:19:50,375 --> 01:19:51,958
I need wifi at home.

1195
01:19:52,458 --> 01:19:55,666
We just use the
neighbor's wifi...

1196
01:19:56,166 --> 01:19:57,458
Internet is Bajrangi Bhaijaan.

1197
01:19:57,958 --> 01:20:02,333
- And the password is...
- Dabangg Sultan.

1198
01:20:02,833 --> 01:20:08,833
How does a husband
say bye to his wife?

1199
01:20:09,333 --> 01:20:10,791
Let's go!

1200
01:20:11,291 --> 01:20:14,791
Move your bag!

1201
01:20:17,750 --> 01:20:21,250
Cover your chest
when you step out.

1202
01:20:26,625 --> 01:20:27,750
What's your work?

1203
01:20:28,250 --> 01:20:29,250
Exactly what we're doing.

1204
01:20:29,750 --> 01:20:31,458
But this is manual labour!

1205
01:20:31,958 --> 01:20:32,958
What's your work?

1206
01:20:33,208 --> 01:20:34,208
I was told...

1207
01:20:34,666 --> 01:20:36,708
to get this moved.

1208
01:20:37,208 --> 01:20:40,000
Then why're you
moving it yourself?

1209
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:42,958
Oh!

1210
01:20:43,458 --> 01:20:43,833
Didn't realise!

1211
01:20:44,333 --> 01:20:45,458
This is the Yard where...

1212
01:20:45,958 --> 01:20:49,375
the damaged trains are
brought for repair.

1213
01:20:49,875 --> 01:20:52,250
The broken parts are
carelessly thrown around.

1214
01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:54,875
I want you to sort this mess.

1215
01:20:55,375 --> 01:20:55,375
Yes.

1216
01:20:55,875 --> 01:20:59,000
Get it cleaned, repainted
and organised.

1217
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:02,708
Sir, every day I -
- have practice?

1218
01:21:03,208 --> 01:21:05,583
Yes.

1219
01:21:06,083 --> 01:21:07,958
Why waste your time...

1220
01:21:08,458 --> 01:21:11,291
practicing to lose
internationally?

1221
01:21:11,791 --> 01:21:14,750
Better to waste
your time here...

1222
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:15,750
it pays.

1223
01:21:16,250 --> 01:21:17,250
Hit harder.

1224
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:19,208
Harder!

1225
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:19,875
Greetings!

1226
01:21:20,375 --> 01:21:22,250
Yeah.

1227
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:24,310
Already arriving late
like a celebrity?

1228
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:26,958
Too much workload.

1229
01:21:27,458 --> 01:21:30,250
I never knew my city
had such a great gym.

1230
01:21:30,750 --> 01:21:31,750
Shravan...

1231
01:21:31,958 --> 01:21:35,000
know him?

1232
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:36,875
Of course Coach...

1233
01:21:37,375 --> 01:21:39,000
Every local boxer who
died dreaming...

1234
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:41,375
he's the reason cited
in the post mortem.

1235
01:21:41,875 --> 01:21:44,625
He's the reason I turned to you.

1236
01:21:45,125 --> 01:21:46,165
You're still as arrogant!

1237
01:21:46,416 --> 01:21:47,458
I'm just being honest.

1238
01:21:47,958 --> 01:21:50,583
You need to grow up...

1239
01:21:51,083 --> 01:21:53,250
What you set out to do...

1240
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:55,350
isn't always what
you end up doing...

1241
01:21:55,750 --> 01:21:57,310
the system finds a
way to crush you.

1242
01:21:57,458 --> 01:22:00,041
He's still managed
to run this gym...

1243
01:22:00,541 --> 01:22:01,666
free of charge...

1244
01:22:02,166 --> 01:22:03,686
without the
authorities' knowledge.

1245
01:22:03,750 --> 01:22:06,625
He reminds me of our youth.

1246
01:22:07,125 --> 01:22:10,166
When we'd get into brawls...
pledging to change the world!

1247
01:22:10,666 --> 01:22:14,166
Couldn't change shit!

1248
01:22:17,833 --> 01:22:19,458
- Do you know my caste?
- No.

1249
01:22:19,958 --> 01:22:21,083
Even I didn't know...

1250
01:22:21,583 --> 01:22:24,000
until my father told me.

1251
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:27,166
And that's how he
clipped my wings.

1252
01:22:27,666 --> 01:22:29,106
He wanted me to study
just enough...

1253
01:22:29,166 --> 01:22:31,666
to get a caste-reserved
spot in government jobs.

1254
01:22:32,166 --> 01:22:35,958
But I wanted it all on merit.

1255
01:22:36,458 --> 01:22:39,000
Then I came across
Pele's story...

1256
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:42,416
of how football gave
him an identity.

1257
01:22:42,916 --> 01:22:45,958
I decided to play football too.

1258
01:22:46,458 --> 01:22:49,833
But the upper caste boys
wouldn't let me play.

1259
01:22:50,333 --> 01:22:51,875
One day I fought with them.

1260
01:22:52,375 --> 01:22:55,833
It was a vicious fight.

1261
01:22:56,333 --> 01:22:59,458
The coach locked me in a room...

1262
01:22:59,958 --> 01:23:01,833
and whacked me.

1263
01:23:02,333 --> 01:23:04,000
He was from my caste.

1264
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:05,708
He gave me a sack of wheat...

1265
01:23:06,208 --> 01:23:08,541
and made me punch it
every time I got angry.

1266
01:23:09,041 --> 01:23:12,250
And that's how I learnt to box.

1267
01:23:12,750 --> 01:23:16,250
But I could never play...

1268
01:23:18,166 --> 01:23:22,541
Every time I walked down the street ..
They'd call me 'The Brawler'.

1269
01:23:23,041 --> 01:23:29,000
They never gave me the
respect of a 'Boxer'.

1270
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:34,250
Now, you decide... Do you want
to be called 'The Brawler'...

1271
01:23:34,750 --> 01:23:38,250
or 'The Boxer'?

1272
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:45,000
Stop that!

1273
01:23:51,958 --> 01:23:55,458
Yes.. I want to sleep...
I'm exhausted.

1274
01:23:59,250 --> 01:24:01,958
I've been waiting
all day for you.

1275
01:24:02,458 --> 01:24:03,738
And I've been working all day...

1276
01:24:03,875 --> 01:24:06,416
had to move heavy
equipment around.

1277
01:24:06,916 --> 01:24:10,291
My training didn't go well, either...
Just ran around in circles.

1278
01:24:10,791 --> 01:24:12,375
Even talking to you
is taking effort.

1279
01:24:12,875 --> 01:24:15,333
You'd promised to
learn my language.

1280
01:24:15,833 --> 01:24:18,458
Your language... But
you can't spea -

1281
01:24:18,958 --> 01:24:22,916
Oh! You mean the sign language.

1282
01:24:23,416 --> 01:24:25,750
See... your phone
speaks for you...

1283
01:24:26,250 --> 01:24:28,416
and you can hear me
and we communicate!

1284
01:24:28,916 --> 01:24:30,916
Do I really need to learn -

1285
01:24:31,416 --> 01:24:35,125
Why are you always hitting me?

1286
01:24:35,625 --> 01:24:39,125
Listen! We don't
need to do this.

1287
01:24:43,291 --> 01:24:45,333
Okay.. I made a mistake.

1288
01:24:45,833 --> 01:24:47,541
Sorry... Let's sleep.

1289
01:24:48,041 --> 01:24:51,750
Come to bed...
Let's not do this!

1290
01:24:52,250 --> 01:24:56,291
How'll you hear me if
you cover your ears?

1291
01:24:56,791 --> 01:24:57,791
Come to bed.

1292
01:24:58,208 --> 01:25:00,125
Why're you being so stubborn?

1293
01:25:00,625 --> 01:25:02,750
How much more do you
want me to apologise!?

1294
01:25:03,250 --> 01:25:04,250
What's going on?

1295
01:25:04,666 --> 01:25:06,541
Nothing... You go sleep.

1296
01:25:07,041 --> 01:25:10,541
Do whatever you want!

1297
01:25:29,583 --> 01:25:32,250
'I'm not a damn pillow'

1298
01:25:32,750 --> 01:25:34,291
When did I ever treat
you like that?

1299
01:25:34,791 --> 01:25:39,041
And is this the time to study?

1300
01:25:39,541 --> 01:25:42,458
'I don't work on your time'.

1301
01:25:42,958 --> 01:25:44,458
Why're you so difficult?

1302
01:25:44,958 --> 01:25:47,333
It was my first
day at work and -

1303
01:25:47,833 --> 01:25:49,916
- how do I even talk to you?!

1304
01:25:50,416 --> 01:25:51,750
Fine...

1305
01:25:52,250 --> 01:25:54,958
You be the first two monkeys of Gandhi...
I'll become the third.

1306
01:25:55,458 --> 01:25:58,258
You don't listen... can't speak...
and I refuse to look at you... Ok?

1307
01:25:58,666 --> 01:26:02,166
Great communication we have!

1308
01:26:19,791 --> 01:26:22,625
Brother, please give me a
month to pay you back.

1309
01:26:23,125 --> 01:26:24,833
I finally have a job.

1310
01:26:25,333 --> 01:26:27,625
And will be in a
permanent position soon.

1311
01:26:28,125 --> 01:26:30,625
Let my salary come in.
I'll pay you first.

1312
01:26:31,125 --> 01:26:32,916
It's only been two weeks.

1313
01:26:33,416 --> 01:26:36,958
Don't worry!

1314
01:26:37,458 --> 01:26:41,458
As soon as you have a job, the
moneylenders become hound dogs.

1315
01:26:41,958 --> 01:26:43,000
- Mr. Shravan..
- Yes.

1316
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:45,100
You can't take personal
calls in office.

1317
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:47,208
What else do I do!

1318
01:26:47,708 --> 01:26:50,291
There's no other work here.

1319
01:26:50,791 --> 01:26:52,041
Shravan.

1320
01:26:52,541 --> 01:26:55,166
Yadav Sir's peon is on leave.
He's called you in.

1321
01:26:55,666 --> 01:26:57,375
So am I a peon now?

1322
01:26:57,875 --> 01:27:01,375
Excuse me!

1323
01:27:02,791 --> 01:27:03,958
Sir... you called -

1324
01:27:04,458 --> 01:27:05,875
- Learn some manners...

1325
01:27:06,375 --> 01:27:09,875
step out and ask,
"May I come in?"

1326
01:27:12,666 --> 01:27:14,083
May I come in?

1327
01:27:14,583 --> 01:27:15,666
You may come in.

1328
01:27:16,166 --> 01:27:17,833
May I sit?

1329
01:27:18,333 --> 01:27:22,250
You may not.

1330
01:27:22,750 --> 01:27:25,291
Get the chief engineer
to sign this...

1331
01:27:25,791 --> 01:27:27,791
and post these letters.

1332
01:27:28,291 --> 01:27:31,833
Sign where?

1333
01:27:32,333 --> 01:27:33,541
Hey...

1334
01:27:34,041 --> 01:27:35,481
Where's the chief
engineer's cabin?

1335
01:27:35,916 --> 01:27:37,458
Which Chief Engineer exactly?

1336
01:27:37,958 --> 01:27:41,958
He didn't give me a name... just
asked me to get this signed.

1337
01:27:42,458 --> 01:27:43,791
But this isn't your job!

1338
01:27:44,291 --> 01:27:45,333
This one's in east block.

1339
01:27:45,833 --> 01:27:47,000
His name is Srinivasan.

1340
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:51,000
Where's Mr. Srinivasan's cabin?

1341
01:27:54,791 --> 01:27:58,291
May I ome in.

1342
01:28:04,250 --> 01:28:05,958
Mr. Srinivasan isn't there!

1343
01:28:06,458 --> 01:28:07,778
Sir's in a meeting
in that block.

1344
01:28:07,802 --> 01:28:09,282
Then why'd you send
me to his cabin!

1345
01:28:09,625 --> 01:28:11,375
You asked for it!

1346
01:28:11,875 --> 01:28:13,250
Do I look like a peon?

1347
01:28:13,750 --> 01:28:14,750
Peon?

1348
01:28:15,208 --> 01:28:19,791
Aren't we all peons to someone?

1349
01:28:20,291 --> 01:28:20,458
What?

1350
01:28:20,958 --> 01:28:22,083
Sir, I need your signature.

1351
01:28:22,583 --> 01:28:25,125
Can't you see I'm in a meeting?

1352
01:28:25,625 --> 01:28:29,125
Wait outside!

1353
01:28:32,726 --> 01:28:33,726
Where the hell are you?

1354
01:28:33,750 --> 01:28:34,910
Do you know what time it is!

1355
01:28:35,250 --> 01:28:35,708
We've been waiting for you!

1356
01:28:36,208 --> 01:28:39,083
I've a tiny job to finish
but they're holding me up.

1357
01:28:39,583 --> 01:28:41,703
I tried to talk to him but
he starts spouting English!

1358
01:28:41,727 --> 01:28:42,935
Tell him you're a sportsman.

1359
01:28:43,333 --> 01:28:44,333
May I...

1360
01:28:44,583 --> 01:28:46,250
What's your problem man?

1361
01:28:46,750 --> 01:28:48,791
I'm a sportsman... Boxer.

1362
01:28:49,291 --> 01:28:50,931
Don't you understand
we're in a meeting!

1363
01:28:51,166 --> 01:28:53,406
I'm here on 'Sports Quota'...
I need to go for training.

1364
01:28:53,666 --> 01:28:53,916
I'm late.

1365
01:28:54,416 --> 01:28:57,916
You get out man!

1366
01:29:03,875 --> 01:29:06,041
What?

1367
01:29:06,541 --> 01:29:08,301
He's got one foot here
and one foot there...

1368
01:29:08,750 --> 01:29:11,375
It'll tear him apart.

1369
01:29:11,875 --> 01:29:14,000
You're still on probation.

1370
01:29:14,500 --> 01:29:17,291
Your job will be confirmed
only if you win at Nationals.

1371
01:29:17,791 --> 01:29:19,375
So boxing is more important!

1372
01:29:19,875 --> 01:29:23,375
You need to make time for it...
every day.

1373
01:29:43,458 --> 01:29:46,958
Sorry!

1374
01:29:58,958 --> 01:30:00,875
She's been in her
room all day...

1375
01:30:01,375 --> 01:30:02,375
hasn't eaten either.

1376
01:30:02,833 --> 01:30:05,458
She neither helps me with
housework nor massages my feet!

1377
01:30:05,958 --> 01:30:07,583
On her computer all day.

1378
01:30:08,083 --> 01:30:09,125
Shut up!

1379
01:30:09,625 --> 01:30:11,025
That's not what I'm
saying at all!

1380
01:30:11,500 --> 01:30:12,833
But that's what I'm saying!

1381
01:30:13,333 --> 01:30:15,125
So... She'll do
what he couldn't!

1382
01:30:15,625 --> 01:30:17,375
Become an officer... not a peon!

1383
01:30:17,875 --> 01:30:19,075
I'm talking about last night!

1384
01:30:19,458 --> 01:30:20,618
I'm talking about every day!

1385
01:30:20,791 --> 01:30:21,291
What every day?!

1386
01:30:21,791 --> 01:30:24,711
I'm trying to resolve a fight and here
you've started a new complaint box!

1387
01:30:24,735 --> 01:30:26,360
Did you ever massage
my mother's feet?

1388
01:30:26,708 --> 01:30:27,166
Great!

1389
01:30:27,666 --> 01:30:31,166
Blame it all on me!

1390
01:30:56,958 --> 01:31:01,625
Sportsmen should marry only
after becoming champions...

1391
01:31:02,125 --> 01:31:04,666
especially wrestlers and boxers.

1392
01:31:05,166 --> 01:31:10,583
When your wives take your sperm...
they also make you weak.

1393
01:31:11,083 --> 01:31:13,458
Your sperm is where
your strength is!

1394
01:31:13,958 --> 01:31:14,958
Think about it...

1395
01:31:15,458 --> 01:31:17,791
Had you married later...

1396
01:31:18,291 --> 01:31:20,916
you'd have a beautiful wife...
bigger dowry...

1397
01:31:21,416 --> 01:31:22,416
and it'd have made news.

1398
01:31:22,708 --> 01:31:28,166
Dangling from a seedy wall.

1399
01:31:28,666 --> 01:31:33,666
Behind a Gandhi picture-frame.

1400
01:31:34,166 --> 01:31:37,916
She slithers on a hot afternoon.

1401
01:31:38,416 --> 01:31:41,958
Long, ugly, wicked!

1402
01:31:42,458 --> 01:31:45,375
That loathsome lizard!

1403
01:31:45,875 --> 01:31:51,791
Creepy-crawly lizard.

1404
01:31:52,291 --> 01:31:52,708
No dinner?

1405
01:31:53,208 --> 01:31:54,208
She's eaten already...

1406
01:31:54,708 --> 01:31:56,068
when does she wait for anyone!

1407
01:31:56,092 --> 01:31:57,958
Deadly-diddly vermin!
That two-faced wizard!

1408
01:31:58,458 --> 01:31:59,958
Oh so crafty!

1409
01:32:00,458 --> 01:32:01,958
Oh so evil!

1410
01:32:02,458 --> 01:32:05,958
That venomous lizard!

1411
01:32:26,666 --> 01:32:30,166
Crawling deviously

1412
01:32:30,666 --> 01:32:32,000
about the picture-frame.

1413
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:33,958
Your husband slept
in class today.

1414
01:32:34,458 --> 01:32:37,916
Preying and prying.

1415
01:32:38,416 --> 01:32:42,125
Preying and prying.

1416
01:32:42,625 --> 01:32:46,041
And just when...

1417
01:32:46,541 --> 01:32:50,166
And just when...

1418
01:32:50,666 --> 01:32:54,166
A moth flutters by,

1419
01:32:54,666 --> 01:32:58,000
And moves past the lizard,

1420
01:32:58,500 --> 01:33:01,833
She grabs it tight.

1421
01:33:02,333 --> 01:33:05,958
Crushes its frail feathers.

1422
01:33:06,458 --> 01:33:10,000
Nibbles on its tender flesh.

1423
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:14,375
Gobbles it up alive.

1424
01:33:14,875 --> 01:33:18,000
And then she sashays away.

1425
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:22,458
As though nothing happened.

1426
01:33:22,958 --> 01:33:26,000
And then she sashays away.

1427
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:30,291
As though no one was harmed.

1428
01:33:30,791 --> 01:33:33,333
Crawls back.

1429
01:33:33,833 --> 01:33:37,916
Crawls back.

1430
01:33:38,416 --> 01:33:41,958
Behind the picture frame.

1431
01:33:42,458 --> 01:33:44,666
Awaiting her next kill.

1432
01:33:45,166 --> 01:33:47,958
My father used to serve an
upper caste landlord...

1433
01:33:48,458 --> 01:33:51,375
now a higher caste serves me.

1434
01:33:51,875 --> 01:33:52,000
Yes.

1435
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:58,000
Creepy-crawly lizard.

1436
01:33:58,500 --> 01:34:01,958
Deadly-diddly vermin.

1437
01:34:02,458 --> 01:34:07,458
That two-faced wizard!

1438
01:34:07,958 --> 01:34:12,708
Sir, it was very difficult
for me to get this job.

1439
01:34:13,208 --> 01:34:16,000
If I lose my game...
I'll lose my job too.

1440
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:19,958
Wasn't easy to get
through sports quota.

1441
01:34:20,458 --> 01:34:22,458
Lot of blood and sweat
has gone into it.

1442
01:34:22,958 --> 01:34:25,958
Please respect my time.

1443
01:34:26,458 --> 01:34:27,958
Training is essential for me.

1444
01:34:28,458 --> 01:34:33,208
If you give me the day's schedule
first thing every morning...

1445
01:34:33,708 --> 01:34:35,583
it'll help me wind up
sooner and leave -

1446
01:34:36,083 --> 01:34:36,458
- Pillai.

1447
01:34:36,958 --> 01:34:40,458
Yes sir!

1448
01:34:42,458 --> 01:34:46,125
I know I've been selfish lately.

1449
01:34:46,625 --> 01:34:48,958
Your mother was talking
about grandkids today...

1450
01:34:49,458 --> 01:34:52,625
but I'm not ready
to be a mother.

1451
01:34:53,125 --> 01:34:55,375
And I realised that I
pushed us to get married...

1452
01:34:55,875 --> 01:35:00,166
without realising how much
more we have to achieve.

1453
01:35:00,666 --> 01:35:02,833
You have your own dream...

1454
01:35:03,333 --> 01:35:05,083
of winning the Nationals.

1455
01:35:05,583 --> 01:35:07,063
You also need to get
a permanent job.

1456
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:10,625
I've been selfishly
adding to your stress.

1457
01:35:11,125 --> 01:35:13,958
Please ignore me and
focus on your boxing...

1458
01:35:14,458 --> 01:35:18,041
till then I'll express
myself through letters...

1459
01:35:18,541 --> 01:35:24,375
and we'll find a way to communicate
till you become a champion.

1460
01:35:24,875 --> 01:35:25,875
May I come in?

1461
01:35:26,250 --> 01:35:29,375
You may come in.

1462
01:35:29,875 --> 01:35:31,083
Do you drive?

1463
01:35:31,583 --> 01:35:32,000
Yes sir.

1464
01:35:32,500 --> 01:35:33,750
Do you know my car?

1465
01:35:34,250 --> 01:35:34,625
Yes.

1466
01:35:35,125 --> 01:35:36,708
Take my car keys...

1467
01:35:37,208 --> 01:35:39,708
and my 'ATM'.

1468
01:35:40,208 --> 01:35:43,583
Go to my house... Give
the 'ATM' to my wife.

1469
01:35:44,083 --> 01:35:46,583
She's in the mood
to go 'marketing'.

1470
01:35:47,083 --> 01:35:49,250
Take her to the market and
drop her back home after.

1471
01:35:49,750 --> 01:35:51,625
Get the car and the 'ATM' back.

1472
01:35:52,125 --> 01:35:52,541
Alright?

1473
01:35:53,041 --> 01:35:54,875
Take it.

1474
01:35:55,375 --> 01:35:56,833
Yadav sir...

1475
01:35:57,333 --> 01:36:00,666
I'm not here to
run your errands.

1476
01:36:01,166 --> 01:36:05,791
I will fill in for your peon
because it's still office work.

1477
01:36:06,291 --> 01:36:09,583
But I'm neither your driver...
nor your servant.

1478
01:36:10,083 --> 01:36:12,125
Nor friend or family.

1479
01:36:12,625 --> 01:36:16,125
May I leave now?

1480
01:36:21,125 --> 01:36:24,625
You've been put on night shift now.
Bye bye to...

1481
01:36:32,666 --> 01:36:33,666
May I come in?

1482
01:36:33,875 --> 01:36:35,833
You may not.

1483
01:36:36,333 --> 01:36:37,458
I can't do night shift.

1484
01:36:37,958 --> 01:36:39,833
Why? Afraid of the dark?

1485
01:36:40,333 --> 01:36:41,625
I have to train for Nationals!

1486
01:36:42,125 --> 01:36:44,250
So just do that... Quit the job!

1487
01:36:44,750 --> 01:36:47,291
You're deliberately making
it difficult for me.

1488
01:36:47,791 --> 01:36:53,041
Do you know how hard one has
to work to get your job?

1489
01:36:53,541 --> 01:36:57,000
I sat under a street lamp to
study while you played outside!

1490
01:36:57,500 --> 01:37:00,041
Why punish me because
you couldn't play!

1491
01:37:00,541 --> 01:37:02,741
What glory has any sport ever
brought to this country!

1492
01:37:02,765 --> 01:37:05,000
As if your education has
turned India into America.

1493
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:07,781
You sit behind this desk...
asking for service all day...

1494
01:37:08,208 --> 01:37:11,048
and jerk off to the idea of a developed
country... Resentful coward.

1495
01:37:11,250 --> 01:37:12,250
- Hey.
- What?

1496
01:37:12,458 --> 01:37:14,916
What did you call me?

1497
01:37:15,416 --> 01:37:16,750
Don't forget who I am!

1498
01:37:17,250 --> 01:37:19,458
I'm the Mike Tyson of the state!

1499
01:37:19,958 --> 01:37:22,708
If I punch you...
you'll shit your pants!

1500
01:37:23,208 --> 01:37:26,125
Another punch... and your
soul will exit this body!

1501
01:37:26,625 --> 01:37:29,250
That sure will develop the railways...
and this country!

1502
01:37:29,750 --> 01:37:33,250
Should I bring the glory?

1503
01:37:39,708 --> 01:37:42,000
What the hell?

1504
01:37:42,500 --> 01:37:45,416
Peed your pants?

1505
01:37:45,916 --> 01:37:47,041
Don't move!

1506
01:37:47,541 --> 01:37:48,833
Take off your pants...

1507
01:37:49,333 --> 01:37:52,958
or should I make you?!

1508
01:37:53,458 --> 01:37:56,208
Quick!

1509
01:37:56,708 --> 01:37:57,708
Say hello to my boss...

1510
01:37:57,958 --> 01:38:00,541
who, in my esteemed company...

1511
01:38:01,041 --> 01:38:03,583
easily wets his pants!

1512
01:38:04,083 --> 01:38:07,583
See the wetness... down there!

1513
01:38:13,375 --> 01:38:15,958
If you ever mess
with me again...

1514
01:38:16,458 --> 01:38:20,291
this video will go viral.

1515
01:38:20,791 --> 01:38:24,291
May I leave?

1516
01:38:33,642 --> 01:38:34,642
Yes coach?

1517
01:38:34,666 --> 01:38:37,166
Remember the boxer who...

1518
01:38:37,666 --> 01:38:39,226
won Bronze at Nationals
last year...

1519
01:38:39,625 --> 01:38:41,291
wants to play a friendly match.

1520
01:38:41,791 --> 01:38:43,551
He's a southpaw... it'll
be a good for you..

1521
01:38:43,958 --> 01:38:44,416
Interested?

1522
01:38:44,916 --> 01:38:48,416
Of course.

1523
01:38:57,833 --> 01:38:59,458
We'll go back to the village.

1524
01:38:59,958 --> 01:39:01,083
We'll plough our fields.

1525
01:39:01,583 --> 01:39:05,083
That wil be better.

1526
01:39:07,333 --> 01:39:09,458
I'll do as Bhagwan says.

1527
01:39:09,958 --> 01:39:13,458
What's wrong?

1528
01:39:24,125 --> 01:39:25,250
Gopal Das!

1529
01:39:25,750 --> 01:39:26,750
Yes?

1530
01:39:27,041 --> 01:39:28,416
Car keys!

1531
01:39:28,916 --> 01:39:29,000
Sorry?

1532
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:33,000
Your car keys.

1533
01:39:37,291 --> 01:39:38,708
Any personal stuff in the car?

1534
01:39:39,208 --> 01:39:41,166
A few...

1535
01:39:41,666 --> 01:39:42,666
Listen...

1536
01:39:42,958 --> 01:39:47,166
bag all his stuff and
take the car away.

1537
01:39:47,666 --> 01:39:49,875
Keys to your drawer?

1538
01:39:50,375 --> 01:39:51,375
But why?

1539
01:39:51,791 --> 01:39:53,458
A case has been filed...

1540
01:39:53,958 --> 01:39:55,958
against you for taking a bribe..

1541
01:39:56,458 --> 01:39:58,166
In the bridge repairing job.

1542
01:39:58,666 --> 01:40:01,791
I knew Bhagwan was behind this.

1543
01:40:02,291 --> 01:40:04,666
I tried calling him.

1544
01:40:05,166 --> 01:40:09,541
Waited for him at his club...

1545
01:40:10,041 --> 01:40:11,416
Neither did he take my calls...

1546
01:40:11,916 --> 01:40:12,916
nor met me.

1547
01:40:13,333 --> 01:40:15,083
When I got home...

1548
01:40:15,583 --> 01:40:17,708
there was a crowd outside.

1549
01:40:18,208 --> 01:40:19,208
Meera sat there...

1550
01:40:19,666 --> 01:40:23,166
with all our stuff
strewn along the road.

1551
01:40:33,958 --> 01:40:37,083
Why're you doing this?

1552
01:40:37,583 --> 01:40:39,625
You got me fired...

1553
01:40:40,125 --> 01:40:41,208
took my car...

1554
01:40:41,708 --> 01:40:45,208
now my house -

1555
01:40:57,666 --> 01:41:00,375
This is my fault, isn't it?

1556
01:41:00,875 --> 01:41:04,375
Are you leaving for
your grandmother's too?

1557
01:41:07,750 --> 01:41:10,375
I promise...

1558
01:41:10,875 --> 01:41:13,166
I'll fix everything.

1559
01:41:13,666 --> 01:41:16,333
I don't know how...

1560
01:41:16,833 --> 01:41:19,041
but I will.

1561
01:41:19,541 --> 01:41:21,708
Safe journey.

1562
01:41:22,208 --> 01:41:25,708
Bye.

1563
01:41:45,125 --> 01:41:46,375
Please step out.

1564
01:41:46,875 --> 01:41:50,375
Come on.

1565
01:42:00,208 --> 01:42:01,708
What happened?

1566
01:42:02,208 --> 01:42:03,488
We have to go to my family home.

1567
01:42:03,958 --> 01:42:05,458
Why?

1568
01:42:05,958 --> 01:42:09,458
Bhagwan wants to
resettle the property.

1569
01:42:40,875 --> 01:42:41,875
Move it.

1570
01:42:42,125 --> 01:42:43,208
Keep your hands off!

1571
01:42:43,708 --> 01:42:44,041
Stay away.

1572
01:42:44,541 --> 01:42:45,583
We're coming!

1573
01:42:46,083 --> 01:42:47,583
Come child!

1574
01:42:48,083 --> 01:42:49,291
Come on.

1575
01:42:49,791 --> 01:42:53,291
Get down.

1576
01:42:57,333 --> 01:42:59,125
Why are we here?

1577
01:42:59,625 --> 01:43:03,125
Come inside.

1578
01:43:04,958 --> 01:43:09,458
I know that wasn't the plan...
but we're here now.

1579
01:43:09,958 --> 01:43:13,458
I don't feel safe here.

1580
01:43:40,875 --> 01:43:44,125
What's wrong?

1581
01:43:44,625 --> 01:43:48,125
Leave me.

1582
01:44:20,875 --> 01:44:24,000
I don't think...

1583
01:44:24,500 --> 01:44:30,250
Gopal Das will ever walk again.

1584
01:44:30,750 --> 01:44:36,708
Your daughter can't
speak as it is...

1585
01:44:37,208 --> 01:44:40,708
Would you like to join
the handicap universe?

1586
01:44:48,875 --> 01:44:52,375
Either you do as I say...

1587
01:44:55,375 --> 01:44:59,708
or choose your body part...

1588
01:45:00,208 --> 01:45:03,708
for sacrifice.

1589
01:45:08,791 --> 01:45:11,083
Right. Right. Use right more.

1590
01:45:11,583 --> 01:45:15,083
Hit him.

1591
01:45:17,166 --> 01:45:20,666
Hit him.

1592
01:45:22,708 --> 01:45:26,208
Punch him.

1593
01:45:51,291 --> 01:45:54,375
That was a solid knock!

1594
01:45:54,875 --> 01:45:56,041
See you at Nationals...

1595
01:45:56,541 --> 01:45:58,708
It'll be fun.

1596
01:45:59,208 --> 01:46:01,166
Ice your hand.- Yes coach.

1597
01:46:01,666 --> 01:46:03,000
You were focussed today...

1598
01:46:03,500 --> 01:46:04,500
played very well.

1599
01:46:04,958 --> 01:46:08,166
I don't know about focus,
but I feel angry a lot.

1600
01:46:08,666 --> 01:46:10,458
You need to control that.

1601
01:46:10,958 --> 01:46:14,458
Come.

1602
01:46:21,416 --> 01:46:23,250
It's a lovely house.

1603
01:46:23,750 --> 01:46:25,000
It's Bhatia's friend's place.

1604
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:27,791
Hey, we're home.

1605
01:46:28,291 --> 01:46:29,291
Rice will take time...

1606
01:46:29,791 --> 01:46:31,583
dinner will be a while.

1607
01:46:32,083 --> 01:46:34,958
You should've told me that
you're bringing someone.

1608
01:46:35,458 --> 01:46:35,958
My mistake...

1609
01:46:36,458 --> 01:46:38,750
won't happen again.

1610
01:46:39,250 --> 01:46:40,458
Listen...

1611
01:46:40,958 --> 01:46:44,750
make the lentil soup thick...
a boxer needs his protein.

1612
01:46:45,250 --> 01:46:47,916
Bhagwan Das will try
everything to disqualify you.

1613
01:46:48,416 --> 01:46:50,208
Can't let that happen.

1614
01:46:50,708 --> 01:46:52,458
Don't eat any outside food.

1615
01:46:52,958 --> 01:46:54,208
It could be adulterated.

1616
01:46:54,708 --> 01:46:56,468
Watch your weight...
keep it under seventy!

1617
01:46:56,875 --> 01:46:59,291
It is... in fact I
want to gain some.

1618
01:46:59,791 --> 01:47:03,166
Good that your wife isn't here...
Rest your body.

1619
01:47:03,666 --> 01:47:05,541
Give more time to practice.

1620
01:47:06,041 --> 01:47:09,125
There's another boxer...

1621
01:47:09,625 --> 01:47:10,791
from Punjab.

1622
01:47:11,291 --> 01:47:14,291
He's young. Watch
his youtube video.

1623
01:47:14,791 --> 01:47:15,791
Watch his moves.

1624
01:47:15,958 --> 01:47:17,250
He's very sharp.

1625
01:47:17,750 --> 01:47:20,041
And if I know
Bhagwan Das well...

1626
01:47:20,541 --> 01:47:24,375
this boxer will be
your first opponent.

1627
01:47:24,875 --> 01:47:26,708
Who's it?

1628
01:47:27,208 --> 01:47:30,333
Hold on!

1629
01:47:30,833 --> 01:47:31,833
Yes.

1630
01:47:31,916 --> 01:47:35,333
We had a feast at home... I
know you like goat meat.

1631
01:47:35,833 --> 01:47:37,916
The neighbours have
sent goat curry..

1632
01:47:38,416 --> 01:47:39,416
What luck!

1633
01:47:39,875 --> 01:47:43,250
Some meat for our dinner!

1634
01:47:43,750 --> 01:47:44,833
Did you hear me?

1635
01:47:45,333 --> 01:47:48,833
There's goat meat for dinner.

1636
01:47:50,791 --> 01:47:52,041
What's with the lights?

1637
01:47:52,541 --> 01:47:53,541
Can you please check?

1638
01:47:53,708 --> 01:47:54,788
Why did the lights go off?

1639
01:47:55,250 --> 01:47:57,750
I'll check.

1640
01:47:58,250 --> 01:48:00,208
Sanjay Kumar! Open the door!

1641
01:48:00,708 --> 01:48:02,708
Don't open the door!

1642
01:48:03,208 --> 01:48:05,125
Relax! You've two boxers here.

1643
01:48:05,625 --> 01:48:07,000
Wait! I'm coming.

1644
01:48:07,500 --> 01:48:09,541
Open up!

1645
01:48:10,041 --> 01:48:12,458
Hail Mother India!
Protect our Holy Cow!

1646
01:48:12,958 --> 01:48:15,541
Smash the bugger's head!

1647
01:48:16,041 --> 01:48:17,583
We are the 'Cow Army'!

1648
01:48:18,083 --> 01:48:19,375
The holy cow is sacred!

1649
01:48:19,875 --> 01:48:23,375
We are her protectors!

1650
01:48:31,791 --> 01:48:32,791
Hit him.

1651
01:48:32,958 --> 01:48:33,958
Hit him.

1652
01:48:34,333 --> 01:48:35,833
Kill him.

1653
01:48:36,333 --> 01:48:39,833
Kill him.

1654
01:49:21,291 --> 01:49:25,375
You've to stay alive, son...

1655
01:49:25,875 --> 01:49:29,375
and watch them all
go one by one.

1656
01:49:46,208 --> 01:49:47,375
Where's coach?

1657
01:49:47,875 --> 01:49:51,250
In the ICU!

1658
01:49:51,750 --> 01:49:55,250
Alive!

1659
01:49:58,791 --> 01:50:02,041
The neighbour dropped
off that meat...

1660
01:50:02,541 --> 01:50:04,875
and said it was goat meat.

1661
01:50:05,375 --> 01:50:10,291
It's not a crime even
if it had been beef.

1662
01:50:10,791 --> 01:50:13,458
We've made a few arrests...

1663
01:50:13,958 --> 01:50:17,458
And Bhagwan Sir?

1664
01:50:20,958 --> 01:50:21,958
He saved your life.

1665
01:50:22,208 --> 01:50:24,166
That's what you think!

1666
01:50:24,666 --> 01:50:25,826
That's what everyone thinks!

1667
01:50:26,041 --> 01:50:28,458
Your coach cooked beef at home.

1668
01:50:28,958 --> 01:50:31,875
Someone at the temple
informed the protectors...

1669
01:50:32,375 --> 01:50:33,455
and the mob lynched you.

1670
01:50:33,916 --> 01:50:38,416
Bhagwan Das arrived in
time to save all of you.

1671
01:50:38,916 --> 01:50:41,250
Everyone believes that...

1672
01:50:41,750 --> 01:50:46,166
and what everyone believes...
is the truth.

1673
01:50:46,666 --> 01:50:50,250
And that should be your
official statement.

1674
01:50:50,750 --> 01:50:51,166
Son...

1675
01:50:51,666 --> 01:50:53,416
A man's true enemy...

1676
01:50:53,916 --> 01:50:56,375
is his own circumstance.

1677
01:50:56,875 --> 01:50:59,791
There is no point
fighting a lost battle.

1678
01:51:00,291 --> 01:51:03,625
Saddam Hussain, Gaddafi..
Were great kings...

1679
01:51:04,125 --> 01:51:05,885
before they were dragged
to their deaths.

1680
01:51:05,958 --> 01:51:07,708
I don't care who...

1681
01:51:08,208 --> 01:51:11,000
or how they died!

1682
01:51:11,500 --> 01:51:15,416
I know that I want to
live on my terms...

1683
01:51:15,916 --> 01:51:17,083
till I die!

1684
01:51:17,583 --> 01:51:20,083
I don't care... If I die
like a king or a dog!

1685
01:51:20,583 --> 01:51:23,208
Rigidity is broken easily
than adaptability.

1686
01:51:23,708 --> 01:51:25,000
Give him what he wants.

1687
01:51:25,500 --> 01:51:26,958
Give it?

1688
01:51:27,458 --> 01:51:29,166
He is asking for my life.

1689
01:51:29,666 --> 01:51:33,750
Sunaina isn't some
medal I won...

1690
01:51:34,250 --> 01:51:37,750
she's my heart and soul.

1691
01:51:52,250 --> 01:51:53,875
Hello Sunaina... where are you?

1692
01:51:54,375 --> 01:51:55,750
Can you hear me?

1693
01:51:56,250 --> 01:51:58,041
Why have you sent me
these divorce papers?

1694
01:51:58,541 --> 01:52:00,083
Want to leave me?

1695
01:52:00,583 --> 01:52:02,103
Or is someone forcing
you to do this?

1696
01:52:02,500 --> 01:52:05,583
I am telling you... I'm
not letting you go.

1697
01:52:06,083 --> 01:52:09,833
And if it's your uncle... tell
him that I'll fight to the end.

1698
01:52:10,333 --> 01:52:12,666
You weren't supposed
to be with him...

1699
01:52:13,166 --> 01:52:15,291
I had better plans for you.

1700
01:52:15,791 --> 01:52:16,208
Where's Sunaina?

1701
01:52:16,708 --> 01:52:17,000
Nevertheless...

1702
01:52:17,500 --> 01:52:19,625
everything happens
for the reason...

1703
01:52:20,125 --> 01:52:24,416
I didn't let you die because I
want to see you lose at Nationals.

1704
01:52:24,916 --> 01:52:25,291
Who'll beat me?

1705
01:52:25,791 --> 01:52:26,250
You're going to
lose on your own.

1706
01:52:26,750 --> 01:52:27,208
And if I don't?

1707
01:52:27,708 --> 01:52:28,708
Then you'll suffer...

1708
01:52:28,916 --> 01:52:30,208
Secondly...

1709
01:52:30,708 --> 01:52:34,416
I've sent the divorce
papers with your parents...

1710
01:52:34,916 --> 01:52:37,208
You'll be divorcing my niece...

1711
01:52:37,708 --> 01:52:40,416
because she's mute and
she didn't pay dowry.

1712
01:52:40,916 --> 01:52:42,250
I won't sign the papers.

1713
01:52:42,750 --> 01:52:45,166
Then I'll make you suffer more.

1714
01:52:45,666 --> 01:52:47,166
I'm not negotiating...

1715
01:52:47,666 --> 01:52:50,875
I'm a Brahmin... so I command...
and you obey! Or else...

1716
01:52:51,375 --> 01:52:54,458
I want to speak to my wife...
and know if she feels the same.

1717
01:52:54,958 --> 01:52:56,333
Let me meet her -

1718
01:52:56,833 --> 01:52:59,541
Hello?

1719
01:53:00,041 --> 01:53:02,291
They're letting me go coach.

1720
01:53:02,791 --> 01:53:06,083
I promise you... that
I'll train hard...

1721
01:53:06,583 --> 01:53:09,458
and I won't let you down.

1722
01:53:09,958 --> 01:53:12,833
I'll win this fight
against Bhagwan Das...

1723
01:53:13,333 --> 01:53:16,833
even if he puts me in the
ring with Tyson himself.

1724
01:53:39,291 --> 01:53:40,833
Wait with your bike
at the market...

1725
01:53:41,333 --> 01:53:42,453
I'll call you when I'm done.

1726
01:53:42,625 --> 01:53:44,666
You're entering Ravana's den...

1727
01:53:45,166 --> 01:53:47,166
If I want to rescue
Sita I'll have to...

1728
01:53:47,666 --> 01:53:50,375
I don't have the
Monkey God to help me.

1729
01:53:50,875 --> 01:53:54,375
Get ready!

1730
01:54:05,750 --> 01:54:08,375
No one knows where Sunaina
has been locked up...

1731
01:54:08,875 --> 01:54:12,208
nor do we know her
parents' whereabouts.

1732
01:54:12,708 --> 01:54:14,458
Son...

1733
01:54:14,958 --> 01:54:16,958
I was thirteen...

1734
01:54:17,458 --> 01:54:21,583
when I was married
off to Bhagwan Das.

1735
01:54:22,083 --> 01:54:28,416
Just do as he says.

1736
01:54:28,916 --> 01:54:32,416
I know the animal
I've been married to.

1737
01:54:36,083 --> 01:54:39,583
Not again! Papa... There's
again a power cut.

1738
01:54:48,375 --> 01:54:49,375
What are you doing here?

1739
01:54:49,750 --> 01:54:52,000
The British have cut
all supplies...

1740
01:54:52,500 --> 01:54:54,434
they'll restart it only
if we hang the rebels.

1741
01:54:54,458 --> 01:54:55,458
What's this nonsense?

1742
01:54:55,666 --> 01:54:58,708
I am waiting...

1743
01:54:59,208 --> 01:55:01,125
for that guy to leave.

1744
01:55:01,625 --> 01:55:04,250
Our water and power supply has been cut...
Thanks to you!

1745
01:55:04,750 --> 01:55:06,110
I've been trying
to steal power...

1746
01:55:06,416 --> 01:55:08,336
for the last two days...
but he won't let me.

1747
01:55:08,583 --> 01:55:11,083
Lord Mountbatten has stationed
him for that job alone.

1748
01:55:11,583 --> 01:55:13,625
I'm waiting for him
to go take a dump...

1749
01:55:14,125 --> 01:55:15,805
so I can hook my wire
to the main line.

1750
01:55:16,291 --> 01:55:21,250
Slowly, the stake went
through my heart...

1751
01:55:21,750 --> 01:55:26,958
Every throb echoes
with torment..

1752
01:55:27,458 --> 01:55:30,958
Gopal, just take my gym bag...

1753
01:55:31,458 --> 01:55:38,958
For without you,
I am but undead.

1754
01:55:39,458 --> 01:55:45,416
A vessel inanimate...

1755
01:55:45,916 --> 01:55:53,916
I am incomplete Without
you, Within me.

1756
01:55:55,541 --> 01:56:03,541
I am incomplete Without
you, Within me.

1757
01:56:06,458 --> 01:56:10,916
This life's adrift
with your void...

1758
01:56:11,416 --> 01:56:15,708
For finding you again.. I will

1759
01:56:16,208 --> 01:56:20,791
Wade through every tempest.

1760
01:56:21,291 --> 01:56:25,208
Annihilate the
strongest mountains

1761
01:56:25,708 --> 01:56:30,000
I'll swim through
lakes of fire..

1762
01:56:30,500 --> 01:56:34,708
Your wounds permeate
through my pain.

1763
01:56:35,208 --> 01:56:39,166
The firestorm's
about to blaze...

1764
01:56:39,666 --> 01:56:44,125
and everything in it's way

1765
01:56:44,625 --> 01:56:50,708
shall be reduced to ashes.

1766
01:56:51,208 --> 01:56:58,958
I am incomplete Without
you, Within me.

1767
01:56:59,458 --> 01:57:02,666
How can I file a report
without evidence!

1768
01:57:03,166 --> 01:57:05,291
He-said-she-said...
doesn't work here.

1769
01:57:05,791 --> 01:57:07,416
It'll be chaos.

1770
01:57:07,916 --> 01:57:09,250
The law doesn't bend for anyone.

1771
01:57:09,750 --> 01:57:11,416
You know I'm telling the truth.

1772
01:57:11,916 --> 01:57:13,476
I know you know what
I've been through.

1773
01:57:13,791 --> 01:57:15,250
Am I Google...

1774
01:57:15,750 --> 01:57:18,583
that I know everything?

1775
01:57:19,083 --> 01:57:23,208
The first rule of law...
is that we know nothing.

1776
01:57:23,708 --> 01:57:26,125
Believe... only what you see!

1777
01:57:26,625 --> 01:57:28,065
I've given her number
to my uncle...

1778
01:57:28,208 --> 01:57:29,708
and told him it's an emergency.

1779
01:57:30,208 --> 01:57:32,833
But he can't track her...
unless she turns her phone on.

1780
01:57:33,333 --> 01:57:35,791
Boss' boys might know
where she's locked up.

1781
01:57:36,291 --> 01:57:38,583
I've tried but
they don't answer.

1782
01:57:39,083 --> 01:57:40,958
They must be the ones
keeping a watch on her.

1783
01:57:41,458 --> 01:57:42,458
Doubtless. 100 percent.

1784
01:57:42,666 --> 01:57:43,666
- What?
- 'Doubtless'

1785
01:57:43,958 --> 01:57:45,708
Don't start spouting
English with me!

1786
01:57:46,208 --> 01:57:48,250
- Eh, man!
- Can't you speak in Hindi?

1787
01:57:48,750 --> 01:57:50,791
Alright! 'Nissandeh'
they're with her.

1788
01:57:51,291 --> 01:57:53,375
So couldn't you say 'Nissandeh'.

1789
01:57:53,875 --> 01:57:54,250
Huh?

1790
01:57:54,750 --> 01:57:56,470
My English as it is...
is six feet under...

1791
01:57:56,708 --> 01:57:58,108
and then you use
complicated words!

1792
01:57:58,132 --> 01:57:59,132
Okay, sorry.

1793
01:57:59,208 --> 01:58:00,408
I think you have brain damage.

1794
01:58:00,500 --> 01:58:02,740
Of course... I've been hit on the head...
Not my knees!

1795
01:58:02,916 --> 01:58:04,791
Okay... Didn't get the joke!

1796
01:58:05,291 --> 01:58:06,291
Can you trace it?

1797
01:58:06,375 --> 01:58:08,095
Ask your uncle to try
his best to trace it.

1798
01:58:08,125 --> 01:58:08,416
What'd you say?

1799
01:58:08,916 --> 01:58:10,516
- Wait a minute...
- No.. What'd you say?

1800
01:58:10,540 --> 01:58:12,748
Asking him to use the number
to find the location.

1801
01:58:12,958 --> 01:58:14,458
- Put it under surveillance.
- Again!

1802
01:58:14,958 --> 01:58:17,458
Eh, please let me - - Enough
with 'doubtless' and 'trace'

1803
01:58:17,958 --> 01:58:19,438
Which language were
you schooled in?

1804
01:58:19,666 --> 01:58:21,291
Did you go to a Convent?

1805
01:58:21,791 --> 01:58:23,751
We went to a Hindi-speaking school!
Did we not?

1806
01:58:23,958 --> 01:58:25,166
Fine! I'm sorry!

1807
01:58:25,666 --> 01:58:26,666
So... Stop it then.

1808
01:58:26,875 --> 01:58:28,833
- Okay.. I did!
- Then talk to him properly!

1809
01:58:29,333 --> 01:58:30,583
Dude! Just listen!

1810
01:58:31,083 --> 01:58:32,083
Use her number... Sorry -

1811
01:58:32,458 --> 01:58:34,625
Use her 'sankhya' to find her.

1812
01:58:35,125 --> 01:58:37,005
If my uncle gets caught...
he'll lose his job!

1813
01:58:37,458 --> 01:58:37,833
And kick my ass!

1814
01:58:38,333 --> 01:58:39,813
Is that job more
important than her?

1815
01:58:39,958 --> 01:58:42,750
She sleeps with him...
not my uncle!

1816
01:58:43,250 --> 01:58:44,791
You broke the only cup you had.

1817
01:58:45,291 --> 01:58:48,791
Nothing else will break...
it's all metal.

1818
01:58:51,809 --> 01:58:52,809
Hey! Shravan!?

1819
01:58:52,833 --> 01:58:53,833
Listen to me...

1820
01:58:54,166 --> 01:58:55,166
Hey! Shravan!?

1821
01:58:55,458 --> 01:58:57,166
Where are you going?

1822
01:58:57,666 --> 01:59:01,166
I'll break your face!

1823
01:59:04,416 --> 01:59:07,000
Have you seen her around?

1824
01:59:07,500 --> 01:59:08,500
She can't speak.

1825
01:59:08,750 --> 01:59:13,250
Have you seen her somewhere?
She can't speak.

1826
01:59:13,750 --> 01:59:14,910
Have you completely lost it?

1827
01:59:15,375 --> 01:59:16,615
This isn't the way to find her.

1828
01:59:16,958 --> 01:59:18,208
Tell me what to do!

1829
01:59:18,708 --> 01:59:20,583
Tell me! Show me the way...

1830
01:59:21,083 --> 01:59:22,958
you All-knowing English
Spouting Baba.

1831
01:59:23,458 --> 01:59:23,708
Shit it out!

1832
01:59:24,208 --> 01:59:27,708
Let's try that.

1833
01:59:51,166 --> 01:59:53,291
Sir, that boy is not giving up.

1834
01:59:53,791 --> 01:59:57,083
If the newspapers get a whiff
of it we'd be in a big mess.

1835
01:59:57,583 --> 02:00:01,083
He's plastered his wife's
posters all over town...

1836
02:00:16,416 --> 02:00:18,833
Stop the car!

1837
02:00:19,333 --> 02:00:20,333
Stop it! Bhagwan Das?

1838
02:00:20,500 --> 02:00:21,833
Where is Sunaina?

1839
02:00:22,333 --> 02:00:25,041
Where the hell is she?

1840
02:00:25,541 --> 02:00:28,041
Tell me! Where is she?

1841
02:00:28,541 --> 02:00:30,458
Where is my wife!

1842
02:00:30,958 --> 02:00:31,458
Get off me!

1843
02:00:31,958 --> 02:00:33,125
Where is Sunaina?

1844
02:00:33,625 --> 02:00:34,083
Where is Sunaina?

1845
02:00:34,583 --> 02:00:36,291
Stay back.

1846
02:00:36,791 --> 02:00:38,000
I won't let him pass...

1847
02:00:38,500 --> 02:00:40,375
until he tells me!

1848
02:00:40,875 --> 02:00:41,875
Where is Sunaina?

1849
02:00:41,916 --> 02:00:43,208
What are you doing?

1850
02:00:43,708 --> 02:00:46,291
Bhagwan Das.

1851
02:00:46,791 --> 02:00:47,791
Where is Sunaina?

1852
02:00:48,041 --> 02:00:49,750
This is not right.

1853
02:00:50,250 --> 02:00:53,041
He has kidnapped my wife!
You're in this with him!

1854
02:00:53,541 --> 02:00:54,000
You were in his car!

1855
02:00:54,500 --> 02:00:56,500
How do you know that he
has kidnapped your wife?!

1856
02:00:56,541 --> 02:00:57,958
Tell me... Why
were you with him?

1857
02:00:58,458 --> 02:00:58,541
I am not with him?

1858
02:00:59,041 --> 02:01:00,041
Get your hands off me!

1859
02:01:00,250 --> 02:01:02,170
You think you can take
law into your own hands!

1860
02:01:02,500 --> 02:01:04,100
I'm not! I'm just
looking for my wife!

1861
02:01:04,416 --> 02:01:06,096
So you think you can
create a scene here!

1862
02:01:06,208 --> 02:01:07,416
Sir, you're sounding like him.

1863
02:01:07,916 --> 02:01:10,250
- Get me proof!
- What proof do you need!

1864
02:01:10,750 --> 02:01:12,510
The divorce papers were
signed by the girl!

1865
02:01:12,958 --> 02:01:15,708
He forced her to! The entire
city knows he kidnapped her!

1866
02:01:16,208 --> 02:01:19,250
That's proof enough!
- But I saw her signatures on the paper.

1867
02:01:19,750 --> 02:01:22,416
I told you she was forced to!
- How are you so sure?

1868
02:01:22,916 --> 02:01:23,916
She would never do it!

1869
02:01:24,250 --> 02:01:26,458
Bhagwan Das is an
elected representative.

1870
02:01:26,958 --> 02:01:28,750
If I wasn't in the
car with him...

1871
02:01:29,250 --> 02:01:32,708
he'd have run you over
or put you in prison.

1872
02:01:33,208 --> 02:01:36,708
Such theatrics won't
bring your wife back!

1873
02:01:44,500 --> 02:01:48,000
Bravo.

1874
02:01:49,250 --> 02:01:53,000
This sombre dusky break of dawn.

1875
02:01:53,500 --> 02:01:57,208
Reminds me of starless
jaded nights.

1876
02:01:57,708 --> 02:02:01,416
While I stare into
unpronounceable abyss.

1877
02:02:01,916 --> 02:02:05,583
For eternity to fail in flight.

1878
02:02:06,083 --> 02:02:09,916
A million hope's
reflection shone

1879
02:02:10,416 --> 02:02:13,958
false miracles unfreed.

1880
02:02:14,458 --> 02:02:18,250
It broke my heart...
It broke my soul...

1881
02:02:18,750 --> 02:02:22,333
Our severed love decreed.

1882
02:02:22,833 --> 02:02:26,625
This sombre dusky break of dawn.

1883
02:02:27,125 --> 02:02:30,708
Reminds me of starless
jaded nights.

1884
02:02:31,208 --> 02:02:35,916
This sombre dusky break of dawn.

1885
02:02:36,416 --> 02:02:39,416
Divorce papers have been signed.

1886
02:02:39,916 --> 02:02:41,291
You've already met the girl.

1887
02:02:41,791 --> 02:02:44,541
She is as beautiful and...
upper caste as she was.

1888
02:02:45,041 --> 02:02:47,000
As for everything else...

1889
02:02:47,500 --> 02:02:49,833
the dowry will compensate.

1890
02:02:50,333 --> 02:02:53,833
Give me the ring.

1891
02:03:00,208 --> 02:03:01,291
Put it on yourself.

1892
02:03:01,791 --> 02:03:02,791
Now put it on her.

1893
02:03:03,041 --> 02:03:04,291
Hold her hand.

1894
02:03:04,791 --> 02:03:05,791
Alright, done!

1895
02:03:05,916 --> 02:03:08,166
- Come on hit me!
- What are you doing?

1896
02:03:08,666 --> 02:03:10,041
Hit me!

1897
02:03:10,541 --> 02:03:11,708
Have you lost your mind!

1898
02:03:12,208 --> 02:03:13,666
I'm practicing!

1899
02:03:14,166 --> 02:03:16,625
You'll get yourself
killed like this!

1900
02:03:17,125 --> 02:03:18,291
Look at you!

1901
02:03:18,791 --> 02:03:20,458
When was the last
time you slept?

1902
02:03:20,958 --> 02:03:22,878
I can't sleep... what do I do?
Shoot up drugs?

1903
02:03:23,250 --> 02:03:24,541
Why not shoot yourself!

1904
02:03:25,041 --> 02:03:29,291
You think your tantrums on the streets
will help you find your wife!

1905
02:03:29,791 --> 02:03:33,666
She's not a movie star... for
people to recognize her by a photo.

1906
02:03:34,166 --> 02:03:35,406
Neither are you a big shot!

1907
02:03:35,625 --> 02:03:37,666
Why would anyone bother!

1908
02:03:38,166 --> 02:03:42,708
It's important for you
to win the Nationals.

1909
02:03:43,208 --> 02:03:44,208
Rest your body.

1910
02:03:44,416 --> 02:03:46,576
How do I rest my body...
when my mind is not at rest!

1911
02:03:46,600 --> 02:03:48,750
You'll have to!

1912
02:03:49,250 --> 02:03:50,250
No one...

1913
02:03:50,625 --> 02:03:52,416
No one is interested
in your tragedy.

1914
02:03:52,916 --> 02:03:54,716
Your anger will be the
death of your career...

1915
02:03:54,740 --> 02:03:55,740
It will kill your game!

1916
02:03:56,166 --> 02:03:59,333
Make anger your weapon!

1917
02:03:59,833 --> 02:04:01,291
Not your state of mind.

1918
02:04:01,791 --> 02:04:03,458
Pack all that rage
you carry within...

1919
02:04:03,958 --> 02:04:05,291
into your fist.

1920
02:04:05,791 --> 02:04:07,750
Then step into that ring...

1921
02:04:08,250 --> 02:04:09,541
and unleash it...

1922
02:04:10,041 --> 02:04:12,458
hit so damn hard that
every one wonders...

1923
02:04:12,958 --> 02:04:15,208
and asks about you.

1924
02:04:15,708 --> 02:04:16,708
What's his name?!

1925
02:04:17,125 --> 02:04:20,041
And when they ask... that's
when you tell them...

1926
02:04:20,541 --> 02:04:22,791
'My name is Shravan
Kumar Singh!'

1927
02:04:23,291 --> 02:04:26,291
Make them listen.

1928
02:04:26,791 --> 02:04:28,916
And when you have
their attention...

1929
02:04:29,416 --> 02:04:30,791
then speak up...

1930
02:04:31,291 --> 02:04:36,541
how this boxing mafia Bhagwan Das
Mishra has snatched your wife.

1931
02:04:37,041 --> 02:04:40,541
You want her back, don't you?

1932
02:04:43,208 --> 02:04:46,791
So play for her...

1933
02:04:47,291 --> 02:04:50,791
and win for her.

1934
02:04:54,625 --> 02:04:56,000
Sunaina.

1935
02:04:56,500 --> 02:04:57,500
Please eat.

1936
02:04:57,958 --> 02:04:58,958
Wake up!

1937
02:04:59,291 --> 02:05:01,041
Please eat, love.

1938
02:05:01,541 --> 02:05:02,541
This food isn't drugged.

1939
02:05:03,041 --> 02:05:05,541
Come! Let's eat.

1940
02:05:06,041 --> 02:05:07,875
What are you staring at?

1941
02:05:08,375 --> 02:05:08,875
Go out!

1942
02:05:09,375 --> 02:05:11,416
She is my child... I
won't let her die.

1943
02:05:11,916 --> 02:05:16,708
She wont eat if you stay here...
Go!

1944
02:05:17,208 --> 02:05:18,208
Please eat love.

1945
02:05:18,666 --> 02:05:22,291
Listen! I've replaced all
the sedatives with water.

1946
02:05:22,791 --> 02:05:25,458
I won't let your uncle
get away with it.

1947
02:05:25,958 --> 02:05:27,250
Open your eyes!

1948
02:05:27,750 --> 02:05:29,666
Eat! I need you to be strong...

1949
02:05:30,166 --> 02:05:32,250
Open your mouth.

1950
02:05:32,750 --> 02:05:34,000
Open your mouth.

1951
02:05:34,500 --> 02:05:37,458
Eat, Sunaina.

1952
02:05:37,958 --> 02:05:41,458
To fight them we need strength.

1953
02:06:05,291 --> 02:06:09,250
My unwinged thoughts of love...

1954
02:06:09,750 --> 02:06:17,750
die before they unfurl...

1955
02:06:18,583 --> 02:06:22,333
so I weave them in misty air...

1956
02:06:22,833 --> 02:06:30,583
for you to breathe
in dewy pearls.

1957
02:06:31,083 --> 02:06:34,916
This shivering
separation ruptured...

1958
02:06:35,416 --> 02:06:39,125
like autumn breath
of dead leaves...

1959
02:06:39,625 --> 02:06:43,375
It broke my heart...
It broke my soul...

1960
02:06:43,875 --> 02:06:47,416
Our severed love decreed.

1961
02:06:47,916 --> 02:06:51,666
This sombre dusky break of dawn.

1962
02:06:52,166 --> 02:06:55,833
Reminds me of starless
jaded nights.

1963
02:06:56,333 --> 02:07:00,083
This sombre dusky break of dawn.

1964
02:07:00,583 --> 02:07:04,083
Reminds me of starless
jaded nights.

1965
02:07:26,208 --> 02:07:30,000
The shrouding shadow
of this sun...

1966
02:07:30,500 --> 02:07:34,083
wrung tragedies on display...

1967
02:07:34,583 --> 02:07:38,458
As I evade to
blurry illusions...

1968
02:07:38,958 --> 02:07:42,458
poisoned with life's misplay.

1969
02:07:51,416 --> 02:07:55,250
The shrouding shadow
of this sun...

1970
02:07:55,750 --> 02:07:59,333
wrung tragedies on display.

1971
02:07:59,833 --> 02:08:03,541
As I evade to blurry illusions

1972
02:08:04,041 --> 02:08:07,791
poisoned with life's misplay.

1973
02:08:08,291 --> 02:08:12,125
This pain refuses
embrace of slumber

1974
02:08:12,625 --> 02:08:16,166
broken, battered and bloodied.

1975
02:08:16,666 --> 02:08:20,458
It broke my heart...
It broke my soul...

1976
02:08:20,958 --> 02:08:24,291
Our severed love decreed.

1977
02:08:24,791 --> 02:08:28,458
Your pious love ignorant...

1978
02:08:28,958 --> 02:08:32,916
Imprinted and uncreased.

1979
02:08:33,416 --> 02:08:37,208
It broke my heart...
It broke my soul...

1980
02:08:37,708 --> 02:08:42,833
Our severed love decreed...

1981
02:08:43,333 --> 02:08:48,625
He has longer hands... stay close
and don't give him room...

1982
02:08:49,125 --> 02:08:52,291
find gaps to hook him
from underneath.

1983
02:08:52,791 --> 02:08:56,291
Take him by surprise
with uppercuts.

1984
02:09:01,166 --> 02:09:03,625
Boxers, shake hands.

1985
02:09:04,125 --> 02:09:06,875
Time keeper.

1986
02:09:07,375 --> 02:09:10,875
Box.

1987
02:09:27,625 --> 02:09:28,625
One.

1988
02:09:28,958 --> 02:09:29,166
Two.

1989
02:09:29,666 --> 02:09:30,666
Yeah...

1990
02:09:31,041 --> 02:09:32,083
Six.

1991
02:09:32,583 --> 02:09:33,583
Seven.

1992
02:09:34,041 --> 02:09:35,083
Eight.

1993
02:09:35,583 --> 02:09:36,583
Nine.

1994
02:09:36,625 --> 02:09:40,125
Knock out!

1995
02:09:46,750 --> 02:09:48,750
I'll tell you an easy way
to keep an eye on her...

1996
02:09:48,774 --> 02:09:52,274
Give me your eyes...
I'll put them on her.

1997
02:09:54,541 --> 02:09:56,250
Look!

1998
02:09:56,750 --> 02:09:57,750
Read it!

1999
02:09:58,250 --> 02:09:59,541
What's on it?

2000
02:10:00,041 --> 02:10:02,583
Headlines say 'Local Tyson...
Shravan Singh.'

2001
02:10:03,083 --> 02:10:06,583
Your Tyson!

2002
02:10:09,666 --> 02:10:15,291
Only the fortunate find
such a beautiful wife...

2003
02:10:15,791 --> 02:10:17,041
Wow. She is gorgeous!

2004
02:10:17,541 --> 02:10:21,041
How did you catch someone
so out of your league?

2005
02:10:26,541 --> 02:10:31,125
Boxing in India has
lost it's stance...

2006
02:10:31,625 --> 02:10:34,416
defence is weak...
there's no footwork.

2007
02:10:34,916 --> 02:10:39,458
By the last round our boxers end
up playing like wrestlers...

2008
02:10:39,958 --> 02:10:43,208
Our young boxers have a
bleak future ahead...

2009
02:10:43,708 --> 02:10:50,791
Our coaches... players... the
entire system needs overhauling.

2010
02:10:51,291 --> 02:10:54,625
The federation has given me the
responsibility to fix this...

2011
02:10:55,125 --> 02:10:58,083
I shall not break their trust.

2012
02:10:58,583 --> 02:11:02,083
Box.

2013
02:11:05,625 --> 02:11:09,833
How did they become friends?

2014
02:11:10,333 --> 02:11:11,973
Aren't they supposed
to fight each other?

2015
02:11:11,997 --> 02:11:13,206
How can they get her engaged?

2016
02:11:13,625 --> 02:11:14,985
I never signed the
divorce papers!

2017
02:11:15,125 --> 02:11:16,916
They've obviously lied...
you genius!

2018
02:11:17,416 --> 02:11:19,583
She's marrying the guy...
whose taillights we broke.

2019
02:11:20,083 --> 02:11:22,791
That sweet shop guy went
for the after-party...

2020
02:11:23,291 --> 02:11:26,011
same sweet shop guy... Remember?
Five bricks... new shoes? Bet?

2021
02:11:26,375 --> 02:11:29,791
He saw the engagement photo
and realised it was Sunaina.

2022
02:11:30,291 --> 02:11:33,791
He called me and I
came straight here!

2023
02:11:41,833 --> 02:11:45,333
Box.

2024
02:12:08,958 --> 02:12:10,833
Dodge him for next two rounds...

2025
02:12:11,333 --> 02:12:12,666
I'll make you win.

2026
02:12:13,166 --> 02:12:16,333
You have to knock him out...

2027
02:12:16,833 --> 02:12:20,333
or else Bhagwan will
beat us in points.

2028
02:12:58,875 --> 02:13:02,375
Stop.

2029
02:13:03,916 --> 02:13:05,958
Final round.

2030
02:13:06,458 --> 02:13:09,958
Seconds out.

2031
02:13:33,333 --> 02:13:34,333
Stop.

2032
02:13:34,833 --> 02:13:35,833
Stop.

2033
02:13:36,291 --> 02:13:37,291
One.

2034
02:13:37,541 --> 02:13:38,541
Two.

2035
02:13:38,958 --> 02:13:39,958
Three.

2036
02:13:40,083 --> 02:13:41,083
Seven.

2037
02:13:41,250 --> 02:13:42,458
Eight.

2038
02:13:42,958 --> 02:13:46,458
Box.

2039
02:13:54,791 --> 02:13:57,166
Stop.

2040
02:13:57,666 --> 02:13:58,666
One.

2041
02:13:58,916 --> 02:14:02,416
Two.

2042
02:14:12,791 --> 02:14:15,416
Stop.

2043
02:14:15,916 --> 02:14:19,291
Three count outs in a single round!
It's a Technical Knockout.

2044
02:14:19,791 --> 02:14:23,291
Blue.

2045
02:14:42,833 --> 02:14:46,333
How did you get here?

2046
02:14:55,791 --> 02:14:58,333
Lets go!

2047
02:14:58,833 --> 02:15:02,333
Come with me.

2048
02:15:03,791 --> 02:15:06,250
Look at those two bulls
sitting there...

2049
02:15:06,750 --> 02:15:08,750
ready to charge on us.

2050
02:15:09,250 --> 02:15:12,208
Just keep moving.

2051
02:15:12,708 --> 02:15:13,828
Where're you going so late?

2052
02:15:14,208 --> 02:15:15,333
Where else!

2053
02:15:15,833 --> 02:15:17,125
Taking her to pee outside...

2054
02:15:17,625 --> 02:15:18,985
she slides off in the bathroom.

2055
02:15:19,416 --> 02:15:21,375
Don't worry... we're
going to the fields...

2056
02:15:21,875 --> 02:15:22,995
will fertilise the crops.

2057
02:15:23,125 --> 02:15:25,250
Please tell them not
to follow us...

2058
02:15:25,750 --> 02:15:26,875
leave us some respect.

2059
02:15:27,375 --> 02:15:34,041
We can't unzip our pants anywhere,
anytime... like you men!

2060
02:15:34,541 --> 02:15:38,041
Quickly.

2061
02:15:54,666 --> 02:15:56,791
Hello.

2062
02:15:57,291 --> 02:16:00,166
Hold on! Coach..
I'll be right back.

2063
02:16:00,666 --> 02:16:03,333
Where are you? I can't
get through anyone...

2064
02:16:03,833 --> 02:16:05,125
neither you... nor Sunaina!

2065
02:16:05,625 --> 02:16:09,083
We're in a village... few
miles out of town...

2066
02:16:09,583 --> 02:16:11,458
at Bhagwan's ancestral home.

2067
02:16:11,958 --> 02:16:13,458
His boxers are
guarding the house.

2068
02:16:13,958 --> 02:16:17,208
He even broke her father's legs.

2069
02:16:17,708 --> 02:16:19,208
Please don't cry...

2070
02:16:19,708 --> 02:16:23,166
give the phone to Sunaina!

2071
02:16:23,666 --> 02:16:25,916
Sunaina! Can you hear me?

2072
02:16:26,416 --> 02:16:28,375
I'd promised you...
I'll fix it...

2073
02:16:28,875 --> 02:16:30,041
I'll come and get you!

2074
02:16:30,541 --> 02:16:31,821
I'm already in Quarterfinals.

2075
02:16:32,041 --> 02:16:38,791
As soon as I win the finals...
I'll come for you!

2076
02:16:39,291 --> 02:16:42,791
It'll be too late by then!

2077
02:16:43,291 --> 02:16:44,291
Gopal.

2078
02:16:44,375 --> 02:16:45,375
Hey Gopal! Wake up.

2079
02:16:45,541 --> 02:16:46,541
We need a car.

2080
02:16:46,666 --> 02:16:50,625
We have to act now... We
don't have time... Hurry up!

2081
02:16:51,125 --> 02:16:54,625
But act on what!

2082
02:16:58,625 --> 02:16:59,625
I see three men...

2083
02:16:59,875 --> 02:17:00,333
- three outside...

2084
02:17:00,833 --> 02:17:03,083
there may be more inside!

2085
02:17:03,583 --> 02:17:07,083
What now?

2086
02:17:30,708 --> 02:17:31,708
Should I leave now?

2087
02:17:31,875 --> 02:17:33,125
Where'll you go?

2088
02:17:33,625 --> 02:17:35,916
You've been righteous
for the first time...

2089
02:17:36,416 --> 02:17:39,208
You've brought us
to Ravana's den...

2090
02:17:39,708 --> 02:17:41,791
You're the Monkey God now!

2091
02:17:42,291 --> 02:17:43,958
Lord Rama has gone
to get Sita...

2092
02:17:44,458 --> 02:17:45,791
now Lakshman will go in too!

2093
02:17:46,291 --> 02:17:49,791
Till then you man the chariot.

2094
02:18:02,416 --> 02:18:03,625
Come on.

2095
02:18:04,125 --> 02:18:05,916
Listen...

2096
02:18:06,416 --> 02:18:08,958
Bring the car around
to the back...

2097
02:18:09,458 --> 02:18:10,708
to the empty yard!

2098
02:18:11,208 --> 02:18:14,208
Be careful! Be smart!

2099
02:18:14,708 --> 02:18:16,541
Have you read The Bhagwad Gita?

2100
02:18:17,041 --> 02:18:20,541
You can't win The Mahabharata
by befriending the enemy.

2101
02:18:24,958 --> 02:18:30,583
You've been trying to represent
India for a while now?

2102
02:18:31,083 --> 02:18:34,583
And you know I'm the only one
who can make that happen?

2103
02:18:35,083 --> 02:18:37,041
Yes.

2104
02:18:37,541 --> 02:18:37,958
What?

2105
02:18:38,458 --> 02:18:39,458
Boss... He is here.

2106
02:18:39,750 --> 02:18:41,666
Who names their kid 'He'?
'He' who?

2107
02:18:42,166 --> 02:18:42,583
Shravan.

2108
02:18:43,083 --> 02:18:44,443
He's here to take
your niece away.

2109
02:18:44,916 --> 02:18:45,250
Where are you?

2110
02:18:45,750 --> 02:18:47,390
He's reached the village.
Get there now!

2111
02:18:47,414 --> 02:18:47,875
'He' who?

2112
02:18:48,375 --> 02:18:49,375
He.. Shravan.

2113
02:18:49,666 --> 02:18:53,166
Who else!?

2114
02:19:37,750 --> 02:19:41,250
My eye! My eye! I
can't see anything.

2115
02:19:47,375 --> 02:19:48,708
Aren't you Sunaina's father?

2116
02:19:49,208 --> 02:19:49,583
Who are you?

2117
02:19:50,083 --> 02:19:51,250
Gopal!

2118
02:19:51,750 --> 02:19:53,070
Yes, I am Gopal!
But who are you?

2119
02:19:53,375 --> 02:19:54,535
You're Gopal! I'm also Gopal!

2120
02:19:54,666 --> 02:19:58,166
We met at Sunaina's wedding!

2121
02:20:02,458 --> 02:20:05,958
Where's Sunaina?

2122
02:21:08,208 --> 02:21:16,208
"Our union is not
easy, beloved."

2123
02:21:21,750 --> 02:21:25,250
"Love is not a game... beloved."

2124
02:21:56,750 --> 02:21:57,958
You wanted proof right?

2125
02:21:58,458 --> 02:22:00,208
She's proof...

2126
02:22:00,708 --> 02:22:01,708
They are proof...

2127
02:22:01,958 --> 02:22:03,791
Bhagwan broke her father's legs.

2128
02:22:04,291 --> 02:22:08,416
Take a look inside... Those
fallen men are also proof.

2129
02:22:08,916 --> 02:22:12,416
May we leave now?

2130
02:22:18,375 --> 02:22:19,541
What are you staring at?

2131
02:22:20,041 --> 02:22:22,166
Arrest him and lock
him up for good!

2132
02:22:22,666 --> 02:22:24,875
On what charge, Sir?

2133
02:22:25,375 --> 02:22:27,458
A husband has come
to get his wife...

2134
02:22:27,958 --> 02:22:29,438
She's leaving on her own will..
How -

2135
02:22:29,462 --> 02:22:31,000
- I'm telling you to...

2136
02:22:31,500 --> 02:22:35,000
Bhagwan Das Mishra! Arrest him!

2137
02:22:39,333 --> 02:22:40,958
He has threatened to kill me.

2138
02:22:41,458 --> 02:22:44,958
But I haven't as yet.

2139
02:23:12,458 --> 02:23:15,958
Now you can arrest him!

2140
02:23:21,166 --> 02:23:24,291
Hail Mother India!

2141
02:23:24,791 --> 02:23:28,541
Hail Mother India!

2142
02:23:29,041 --> 02:23:32,541
Hail Mother India!

2143
02:23:39,041 --> 02:23:41,458
Hail Mother India!

2144
02:23:41,958 --> 02:23:45,416
Hail Mother India!

2145
02:23:45,916 --> 02:23:48,958
Hail Mother India!

2146
02:23:49,458 --> 02:23:52,166
Hail Mother India!

2147
02:23:52,666 --> 02:23:55,125
Hail Mother India!

2148
02:23:55,625 --> 02:23:59,125
Hail Mother India!

2149
02:24:09,583 --> 02:24:11,666
Take a deep breath.

2150
02:24:12,166 --> 02:24:14,791
Show me your wounds!

2151
02:24:15,291 --> 02:24:18,791
Does it hurt?

2152
02:24:27,916 --> 02:24:30,875
Don't be stubborn! How can
we permit him to play?

2153
02:24:31,375 --> 02:24:33,625
I'll lose my job over it!

2154
02:24:34,125 --> 02:24:35,165
It's a matter of his life!

2155
02:24:35,458 --> 02:24:36,666
But he seems fine as of now.

2156
02:24:37,166 --> 02:24:42,166
The doctor's here... if he permits...
go ahead and play.

2157
02:24:42,666 --> 02:24:43,666
But I can play.

2158
02:24:43,916 --> 02:24:45,458
They won't let you.

2159
02:24:45,958 --> 02:24:47,078
Your left kidney is injured.

2160
02:24:47,541 --> 02:24:51,708
One kidney is enough...
to keep a man alive!

2161
02:24:52,208 --> 02:24:55,708
I've already won the battle...
all that's left to do is fight!

2162
02:25:04,458 --> 02:25:05,625
Bhagwan Sir...

2163
02:25:06,125 --> 02:25:08,041
Please try to forgive me.

2164
02:25:08,541 --> 02:25:13,041
Sunaina is my world... It was
my duty to fight for her.

2165
02:25:13,541 --> 02:25:15,166
Please don't disqualify me..

2166
02:25:15,666 --> 02:25:17,458
I don't want to lose
without the fight.

2167
02:25:17,958 --> 02:25:20,416
Let me play?

2168
02:25:20,916 --> 02:25:24,416
I'm begging you.

2169
02:25:35,041 --> 02:25:36,375
Yes.

2170
02:25:36,875 --> 02:25:40,375
Bhagwan Das.

2171
02:25:41,583 --> 02:25:43,375
I'm coming.

2172
02:25:43,875 --> 02:25:46,125
You carry on.

2173
02:25:46,625 --> 02:25:50,125
Go.

2174
02:26:07,583 --> 02:26:11,958
Let it go... You said you'd
even give up boxing for us.

2175
02:26:12,458 --> 02:26:15,208
Compete next time!

2176
02:26:15,708 --> 02:26:17,083
Do you...

2177
02:26:17,583 --> 02:26:18,583
know...

2178
02:26:18,666 --> 02:26:19,083
how much...

2179
02:26:19,583 --> 02:26:20,583
I...

2180
02:26:20,708 --> 02:26:22,000
love...

2181
02:26:22,500 --> 02:26:26,000
you!

2182
02:26:45,708 --> 02:26:46,708
He has two conditions.

2183
02:26:47,166 --> 02:26:50,541
He'll never come between
the two of you...

2184
02:26:51,041 --> 02:26:53,250
but you'll never speak of...

2185
02:26:53,750 --> 02:26:56,125
the past... nor will he.

2186
02:26:56,625 --> 02:26:57,625
Forget everything!

2187
02:26:57,833 --> 02:26:58,958
And second?

2188
02:26:59,458 --> 02:27:02,958
After this match... you'll
retire from boxing.

2189
02:27:20,541 --> 02:27:27,833
"Punched to the guts..."

2190
02:27:28,333 --> 02:27:36,333
"my son."

2191
02:27:38,083 --> 02:27:42,291
"My beloved son..."

2192
02:27:42,791 --> 02:27:46,666
"My son..."

2193
02:27:47,166 --> 02:27:50,666
"He tied a stone and
jumped in the water."

2194
02:28:15,101 --> 02:28:16,101
Injuries?

2195
02:28:16,125 --> 02:28:18,250
Jury approved.

2196
02:28:18,750 --> 02:28:20,708
Okay.

2197
02:28:21,208 --> 02:28:24,708
Blue.

2198
02:28:31,750 --> 02:28:32,750
Red-Blue.

2199
02:28:33,166 --> 02:28:34,250
Shake hands.

2200
02:28:34,750 --> 02:28:36,350
What happened? You
were fine yesterday.

2201
02:28:36,541 --> 02:28:38,875
Have you ever knocked anyone
out in the first punch?

2202
02:28:39,375 --> 02:28:42,125
Today you'll write history!

2203
02:28:42,625 --> 02:28:46,416
Game on. Time.

2204
02:28:46,916 --> 02:28:49,208
Box.

2205
02:28:49,708 --> 02:28:51,291
Hit me!

2206
02:28:51,791 --> 02:28:53,333
Come on.

2207
02:28:53,833 --> 02:28:57,333
Go ahead! Hit me!

2208
02:28:59,250 --> 02:29:02,750
Hit me.

2209
02:29:13,666 --> 02:29:16,625
Hit me.

2210
02:29:17,125 --> 02:29:20,625
Come on.

2211
02:29:25,750 --> 02:29:29,083
Stop.

2212
02:29:29,583 --> 02:29:31,083
Two.

2213
02:29:31,583 --> 02:29:33,375
Three.

2214
02:29:33,875 --> 02:29:35,750
Four.

2215
02:29:36,250 --> 02:29:37,958
Five.

2216
02:29:38,458 --> 02:29:39,791
Six.

2217
02:29:40,291 --> 02:29:41,958
Seven.

2218
02:29:42,458 --> 02:29:44,333
Eight.

2219
02:29:44,833 --> 02:29:46,166
Nine.

2220
02:29:46,666 --> 02:29:47,666
Ten.

2221
02:29:47,916 --> 02:29:51,416
Match over.

2222
02:29:51,440 --> 02:29:55,540
Subtitle By lllllllllllllll

2223
02:29:55,541 --> 02:29:59,041
"Enough respect, you..."

2224
02:30:24,750 --> 02:30:28,333
"Enough respect, you...
go to hell.."

2225
02:30:28,833 --> 02:30:32,916
"I'll keep my head held
high, go to hell."

2226
02:30:33,416 --> 02:30:37,375
"Enough respect, you...
go to hell.."

2227
02:30:37,875 --> 02:30:41,375
"I'll keep my head held
high, go to hell."

2228
02:30:46,958 --> 02:30:50,625
"Splatters of blood."

2229
02:30:51,125 --> 02:30:55,333
"Splatters of blood spreads
in all directions."

2230
02:30:55,833 --> 02:30:57,250
"in all directions."

2231
02:30:57,750 --> 02:31:04,166
"Tying a bell around my neck
is like showing me the noose."

2232
02:31:04,666 --> 02:31:08,708
"I've been forged
out of metal..."

2233
02:31:09,208 --> 02:31:10,791
"and thrown in the pits."

2234
02:31:11,291 --> 02:31:13,291
"Used as a punching bag..."

2235
02:31:13,791 --> 02:31:15,333
"and stabbed in the back."

2236
02:31:15,833 --> 02:31:17,458
"Now I won't do
what I always did."

2237
02:31:17,958 --> 02:31:19,791
"I won't listen anymore..."

2238
02:31:20,291 --> 02:31:23,958
"I'll become a example,
to hell with you."

2239
02:31:24,458 --> 02:31:27,958
"Enough respect, you..."

2240
02:31:35,791 --> 02:31:39,458
"Enough respect, you...
go to hell.."

2241
02:31:39,958 --> 02:31:44,041
"I'll keep my head held
high, go to hell."

"Enough respect, you...
go to hell.."

2243
02:31:48,875 --> 02:31:52,375
"I'll keep my head held
high, go to hell."

2244
02:31:59,958 --> 02:32:04,000
"At gun point you
ask me to dance."

2245
02:32:04,500 --> 02:32:06,291
"You hurl abuses..."

2246
02:32:06,791 --> 02:32:08,458
"and want respect in return."

2247
02:32:08,958 --> 02:32:10,916
"Whether I win or
not, but I'll fight."

2248
02:32:11,416 --> 02:32:13,216
"Whether you behead me,
but we won't listen."

2249
02:32:13,666 --> 02:32:15,333
"We won't listen,
we'll always say..."

2250
02:32:15,833 --> 02:32:17,666
"We won't suffocate anymore."

2251
02:32:18,166 --> 02:32:19,875

we'll always say..."

"Enough respect, you..."

2255
02:32:33,583 --> 02:32:37,541
"Stuffed a piece of bread and
punched me in the guts."

2256
02:32:38,041 --> 02:32:41,750
"My son..."

2257
02:32:42,250 --> 02:32:46,458
"My son robbed me and
then paid my debts."

2258
02:32:46,958 --> 02:32:50,958
"My son..."

2259
02:32:51,458 --> 02:32:53,208
"We won't suffocate anymore."

2260
02:32:53,708 --> 02:32:55,333
"We won't listen,
we'll always say..."

2261
02:32:55,833 --> 02:33:01,750
"Enough respect, you..."

2262
