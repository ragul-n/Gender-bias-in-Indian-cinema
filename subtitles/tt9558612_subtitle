..love and nationalism in the hearts of
youth and citizen of this great nation.

5
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:26,000
While portraying Modiji's

6
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:27,934
..grandeur and dignity we've
taken some artistic liberty.

8
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:32,348
Also presented
some fictitious characters.

9
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:34,833
References are taken
from public sectors..

10
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:37,791

00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:39,934
..and articles published in

12
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:40,833
And his interviews.

00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,625
This film's doesn't

17
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:50,934
..historical truth of any of the actor..

18

any person or community's trust..

21
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:59,291
..or emotion, religion or nationhood.

22
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:38,833
This story is not of a man..

23
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,250
..but of a country.

24
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:43,125
India.

25
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:44,666
In 2013.

26
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,375
This country had to take a decision..

27
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:51,125
..to either create a history..

28
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:53,541
..or become the history.

29
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:59,250
And there was a man
standing on the crossroad.

30
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,208
India is waiting for one decision.

31
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:12,541
Will BJP declare Narendra Modi
as it's PM candidate or not?

32
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:17,875
News even stirred
the ruling party camp.

33
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,333
A leap from CM to PM?

34
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:21,625
Is it a joke?

35
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:24,291
They've many seniors in the party.

36
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,125
He stands no chance.

37
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:28,708
First of all,
he won't get the nomination.

38
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,773
Godhra case is already hounding him.

39
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:34,916
What's your opinion?

40
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,125
I'm not a politician like you, madam.

41
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,500
But I'd like to say one thing
to your party workers.

42
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,875
I've been observing
this man from past 30 years.

43
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:48,791
Looking at his background.

44
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:50,208
And his working style.

45
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:53,750
He can reach any height.

46
00:03:58,625 --> 00:03:59,625
Madam.

47
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,666
BJP has announced its candidate.

48
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,625
Modi.

49
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:08,208
BJP has confirmed Narendra Modi
as its PM candidate.

50
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:11,041
As you can see,
the nation is overjoyed.

51
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,708
Hey.. Modi. Modi.

52
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,083
He was loved by the
millions of people.

53
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:25,041
At the same time, not liked by some.

54
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:26,916
Why is everyone so tensed?

55
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:32,208
An ordinary tea-seller can
never become this country's PM.

56
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:34,458
He wants to come to Delhi. Let him come.

57
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:36,708
We will install a tea-stall outside..

58
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,559
..the parliament building
for him to sell tea.

59
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:40,833
Anyway, who's this Modi?

60
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,041
It was the decade of 1950.

61
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,000
A small village of Gujarat known as.

62
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,291
Vadnagar.

63
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:59,625
In his tender age he had realized..

64
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,333
..that progress lies
in speed and policy.

65
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,208
Everyone's choice, Modi's tea.

66
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:11,750
Have some tea, uncle.

67
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,666
Everyone's choice, Modi's tea.

68
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:36,791
Dad, this is today's income.

69
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,708
Hurry up, son.
You're getting late for the school.

70
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,083
Bye, I am going.

71
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,500
Listen, son.

72
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,500
Let's go, Raju.

73
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,833
He goes to school and works as well.

74
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,416
Sometimes he says such
meaningful things..

75
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:06,000
..that I feel..

76
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,583
..I am not his father..

77
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,750
..he is mine.

78
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:14,500
You too work as a house cleaner.

79
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,458
I cannot stop you either.

80
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:20,416
I don't like this.

81
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,500
Everything will be fine.

82
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:40,250
Naru, why do you always
salute at the flag?

83
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,416
Why do you always
bow down at the temple?

84
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:44,916
Let's go.

85
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,791
Speed up, more dishes are coming.

86
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,166
Naru!

87
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,083
Say Jai Hind again.

88
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:28,875
Stop troubling him.

89
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:29,958
Start eating.

90
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,333
Mom, a bread please.

91
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,833
I'll get it.

92
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:37,750
- Here.
- Mom, a bread please.

93
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,291
- Mom, water.
- Do you want?

94
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,500
Me, too.

95
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:41,958
You take it, son.

96
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:43,416
- Mom.
- Yes.

97
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,708
What do you want, Naru?

98
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,041
Hey, Naru.

99
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:08,583
I will do it, son.

100
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:09,666
Not you. Get up.

101
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,625
No, mom. Not you but
I will do the dishes at home.

102
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,458
You're very stubborn.

103
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,083
Sardar Patel had already warned..

104
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:29,125
..Nehru not to trust these Chinese.

105
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:29,916
Huh!

106
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:31,875
Look what happened.

107
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:35,375
Nehru didn't listen to Sardar
Patel in the Kashmir either.

108
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,625
We will soon be fighting
a war with Pakistan too.

109
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,583
You are right.

110
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,041
Let's see what happens in future.

111
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:43,458
Hello, brother.

112
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,000
What?

113
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,750
A long discussion over tea is fair..

114
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:54,208
..but education is
an expensive affair.

115
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,125
It's quite beneficial.

116
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,041
What do you mean?

117
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,208
You won't get it.

118
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:09,291
Next song is dedicated
to our brave soldiers..

119
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,000
..who are leaving
for the India-China war.

120
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,750
- I salute to..
- The motherland!

121
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:51,083
- I salute to..
- The motherland!

122
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:53,750
Narendra was raised with
the idealism of India.

123
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:57,041
And now he wanted to
make an ideal India.

124
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:04,625
'Don't be so heartless.
Try to understand.'

125
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:07,083
'They are married since childhood.'

126
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:08,125
'No.'

127
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:09,726
'Only after you give the dowry,
will they get married.'

128
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,875
'Who will marry me?'

129
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:15,000
'I will marry your daughter.' Go.

130
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:16,541
Go. Go!

131
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:23,291
I will not marry your daughter.

132
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:29,208
How heartless!
You're bargaining your own daughter!

133
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,541
And you..

134
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,541
You're promoting
a minor girl's marriage?

135
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:34,625
This dowry and child-marriage..

136
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,083
..are a curse
for every woman in India.

137
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,291
It's an insult of her dignity.

138
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,833
Listen to me.

139
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,416
Your parents gave you life.

140
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:52,625
But you've the sole right
to take your life's decisions.

141
00:10:55,958 --> 00:11:01,291
We can never be a strong nation
as long as our women are helpless.

142
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:06,083
Because, in women power
lies the power of India.

143
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,083
Very well said!

144
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,958
But you should be a
leader and not an actor.

145
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:37,500
- By the way, I am..
- Mr. Laxmanrao Inamdar.

146
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,541
Alias 'Vakilbabu' (lawyer).

147
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:42,458
Indeed, you've all
the qualities of a leader.

148
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:43,541
No..

149
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,333
Well, the excitement
doubled after seeing you.

150
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:48,625
Narendra, I want you to joins us..

151
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,208
..as the publicists of RSS.

152
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,291
Don't you wish to serve the nation?

153
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:56,875
Yes, I wish to but...

154
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:58,916
There's a confusion.

155
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Confusion?!

156
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,416
I've still not discovered myself.

157
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:09,333
Sometimes I wish to join Sangh..

158
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:13,000
..and sometimes,
army so as to serve the country.

159
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:15,250
And sometimes I just wish to..

160
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,916
..renounce everything and
live in Himalayas.

161
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:22,375
Narendra, some people
leave their decisions on fate.

162
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,083
Sometimes it's heads
and sometimes tail.

163
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:30,166
Only one in a million
shapes his fate..

164
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,833
..with his firm decision.

165
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:34,833
Fate or endeavours.

166
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,166
Choose any one.

167
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:57,166
Got two tickets.

168
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,250
- Wow!
- Let's go.

169
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:17,291
"I wish to relive
these moments today."

170
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:21,291
'I swear, I will never
introduce myself as a guide.'

171
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:22,166
'You please come back to the hotel.'

172
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,000
'Or else people will misunderstand..'

173
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:24,683
'..that I am roaming
with a drunk woman.'

174
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,083
'Raju.'

175
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:32,958
'A stone that invokes faith..'

176
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:35,333
'..is worshipped as God.'

177
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:38,708
'A place where you
experience divinity..'

178
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:40,500
'..is none less than a shrine.'

179
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:44,041
'A man who invokes
spirituality in you..'

180
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,333
'..is a great man.'

181
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:50,000
'Someone else decides..'

182
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,958
'..you are just a medium.'

183
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,625
'He does the work
and you get the credit.'

184
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:57,875
'Just keep chanting His name..'

185
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:01,208
'..and do the job
He has given to you.'

186
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:34,041
Aunt, one bread please.

187
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,875
Are you possessed
by Dev Anand now?

188
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:42,166
- No, I'm full.
- Just one bread.

189
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,500
Mom.

190
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:47,125
Yes.

191
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,958
I want to be a celibate.

192
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:57,416
Sometime, a soldier.
Then RSS publicist.

193
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,708
And now a celibate.

194
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:00,708
We will lose this boy.

195
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,833
- Now what?
- He needs to be bonded now.

196
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,416
17th of the next month
will be auspicious.

197
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,208
Why wait for a month?

198
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,333
Fix a date in this month.

199
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:30,958
Yes, of course.

200
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:33,125
As you wish.

201
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:35,666
What are you reading these days, son?

202
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:39,083
This is Gautam Buddha's biography.

203
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:40,375
What was his life story?

204
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:42,083
He was a king.

205
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,125
He had everything..

206
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:45,625
..yet he was upset.

207
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,875
One day, he set out
to discover himself.

208
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:50,208
Leaving behind his wife
and son alone.

209
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:52,083
He renounced everything.

210
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:55,083
He spent his entire
life in serving people..

211
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,125
..and finally attained
salvation (nirvana).

212
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,041
That's great!

213
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,125
Indeed. He was a great soul.

214
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,916
I want to follow him in my life.

215
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:12,916
Dad.

216
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,916
Dad, your blessings.

217
00:16:56,208 --> 00:17:02,458
"Wandering in search.."

218
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:12,416
"Wandering in search.."

219
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,208
"yet remained unquenched."

220
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:19,541
"Like a moth, that's destined.."

221
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:22,916
"to burn down near a flame."

222
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:27,541
"Restlessly he just moves on."

223
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,041
"Restlessly he just moves on."

224
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:36,500
"And spends sleepless nights."

225
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:42,250
"Away from the worldly attachments."

226
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:49,333
"This disassociated heart
is unable to find solace."

227
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:55,750
"This disassociated heart
is unable to find solace."

228
00:17:56,208 --> 00:18:02,875
"This disassociated heart
is unable to find solace."

229
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,125
"This disassociated heart
is unable to find solace."

230
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:33,958
"After the continuous
journey over time.."

231
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:43,000
"After the continuous
journey over time.."

232
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:50,833
"now, tired of this
search for enlightenment."

233
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:58,000
"Controlled the sorrows
and happiness."

234
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:01,000
"Controlled the sorrows
and happiness.."

235
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:04,666
"and enjoying the detachment."

236
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:08,916
"This thirst is such.."

237
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:14,750
"This thirst is such.."

238
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:17,416
"that everything seems deceiving."

239
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:23,750
"This disassociated heart
is unable to find solace."

240
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:31,625
"This disassociated heart
is unable to find solace."

241
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,125
- Will you have some tea?
- Yes.

242
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:21,791
Sage, I've renounced
my family and married life.

243
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:25,375
I've many questions on my mind.

244
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:30,708
I don't know my destination,
my goal in life.

245
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:32,791
What's the purpose of my life?

246
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:34,125
That's it. The mug..

247
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:36,166
It's full, right?

248
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:41,791
Similarly,
your mind is full of questions.

249
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:44,291
Let's put an end to it.

250
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:51,958
Henceforth, not you but
I will pose questions to you.

251
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:53,750
Hail river Ganges!

252
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,375
After 20 years of
rigourous austerity..

253
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:57,875
..if you're granted
with a divine power..

254
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,916
..by which you can walk
on the water and cross the river.

255
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:04,041
Or an ordinary boat..

256
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:07,916
..by which you can sail
thousands of people across the river.

257
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:09,541
What will you choose?

258
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:12,958
Sage, I..

259
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,541
I will choose the boat.

260
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:23,375
Was my answer correct?

261
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,833
I will tell you at the right time.

262
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,916
- Narendra.
- Yes.

263
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:38,083
- Pass that knife.
- Right away.

264
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,833
Sage, quite a few days passed..

265
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:47,583
..but you didn't ask any question.

266
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:49,875
Why?

267
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:51,875
I just asked you and you..

268
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:55,041
- Just now?
- Yes, and you replied.

269
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,875
I didn't understand.

270
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:58,666
But I did.

271
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:19,625
These are very old and huge trees.

272
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:22,416
But now they have decayed.

273
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:26,541
So, they need to be cut down.

274
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:33,875
Tell me one thing.

275
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,850
Now that you've cut down this tree,
what will be your next action?

276
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:40,083
Sage, now that I've
uprooted this tree..

277
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:41,875
..can I sow-in something else?

278
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:43,666
Yes, Narendra.

279
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:44,875
Sure.

280
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:54,291
Today you've discovered yourself.

281
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,458
Your life's purpose is down there.
Not here.

282
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:02,416
Meaning?

283
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,916
Recollect all the questioned
I posed to you in past 2 years..

284
00:23:06,666 --> 00:23:07,708
..and your replies.

285
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:10,541
After 20 years of austerity,
the one who would learn..

286
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:13,875
..to walk on the water
is called 'yogi' (sage).

287
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:17,291
But in the same time, if somebody..

288
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:21,458
..would help and serve
thousands of people..

289
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:24,333
..then he is called 'Karma
Yogi' (sage by karma).

290
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:29,375
You handed me the knife
with the blade on your side.

291
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:35,083
It means when it comes to people,
you think selflessly.

292
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:38,458
As you have sown new seeds..

293
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:40,583
..in place of the decayed trees.

294
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:46,416
Even this society,
this entire country is decaying.

295
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:50,041
You must shape new India.

296
00:23:58,583 --> 00:23:59,583
Always..

297
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:01,583
..keep grounded.

298
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:03,916
And aim for the skies.

299
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:08,000
This government's corruption..

300
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:09,875
..has taken a heavy toll of Gujarat.

301
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:13,625
We must continue with
this Nav Nirman movement.

302
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:20,250
Who will be the foundation
of this new Gujarat?

303
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:26,875
Narendra.

304
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:28,583
Vakilbabu.

305
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,875
Now, I don't need this coin.

306
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:35,750
I will shape my own future.

307
00:24:39,541 --> 00:24:42,250
RSS is not just an
organisation but an army.

308
00:24:42,875 --> 00:24:45,333
It will tirelessly
fight for the country.

309
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,541
Country's enemy will be our enemy.

310
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,000
My life is dedicated for United India.

311
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:53,541
It's not that easy.

312
00:24:55,541 --> 00:24:57,125
You will have to work day and night.

313
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:00,892
These eyes have nurtured many
dreams for the country.

314
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,750
I am ready to sacrifice anything.

315
00:25:05,625 --> 00:25:07,625
You will have to compromise
your comforts.

316
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:10,833
Hard work is my comfort.

317
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:15,650
Self service will be your motto.
Including the smallest jobs.

318
00:25:17,708 --> 00:25:20,833
No work is big or small.
It's just the thinking.

319
00:25:22,833 --> 00:25:24,500
You will have to
sacrifice your riches.

320
00:25:26,375 --> 00:25:28,250
Nationalism is my property.

321
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,220
And the people of this
nation are my riches.

322
00:25:31,916 --> 00:25:34,875
This head will held high
for the tricolour only.

323
00:25:35,416 --> 00:25:37,875
And my voice will be
raised for the people only.

324
00:25:37,958 --> 00:25:41,666
This is a very important
rally of our movement.

325
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,625
We will constantly build the pressure.

326
00:25:43,791 --> 00:25:45,625
And make sure the
government is collapsed.

327
00:25:45,833 --> 00:25:47,750
- Are you all ready?
- Ready.

328
00:25:47,833 --> 00:25:48,833
Ready.

329
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:49,875
Good!

330
00:25:50,166 --> 00:25:51,541
A bad news, Vakilbabu.

331
00:25:51,625 --> 00:25:54,041
All our volunteers are arrested.

332
00:25:54,375 --> 00:25:56,625
On the direct orders
from the CM office.

333
00:25:58,166 --> 00:26:00,208
- We must cancel this rally.
- No.

334
00:26:01,125 --> 00:26:04,875
There'll be no change in rally.
I want 1000 people.

335
00:26:05,083 --> 00:26:06,083
Impossible.

336
00:26:06,958 --> 00:26:08,934
It's difficult to bring together
100 people in present situation.

337
00:26:08,958 --> 00:26:10,038
How will we gather so many?

338
00:26:10,125 --> 00:26:11,208
And who will bring them?

339
00:26:12,166 --> 00:26:13,166
I will..

340
00:26:18,916 --> 00:26:20,125
Not just 1000..

341
00:26:22,125 --> 00:26:23,208
..but 10,000.

342
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,375
You're too much.

343
00:26:30,875 --> 00:26:32,458
Not even for the free meal do people..

344
00:26:32,541 --> 00:26:33,833
..gather in this huge numbers.

345
00:26:36,625 --> 00:26:37,833
Have you gone mad?

346
00:26:38,333 --> 00:26:40,093
You're always ready
to take up the challenge.

347
00:26:48,041 --> 00:26:50,250
Listen to me for just five minutes..

348
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:54,500
..and I promise your
bank balance will increase.

349
00:26:54,583 --> 00:26:55,750
How?

350
00:26:55,833 --> 00:26:59,375
Because your stolen
amount will return to you.

351
00:26:59,625 --> 00:27:02,375
At least Rs.150 stolen from each.

352
00:27:02,666 --> 00:27:03,875
Who stole our money?

353
00:27:03,958 --> 00:27:06,083
Your chief minister Chintanbhai..

354
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,583
..and his government.

355
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:11,375
An ordinary family's
ration would cost Rs.12.

356
00:27:11,666 --> 00:27:12,809
How much does it cost you now?

357
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:15,125
- Rs.32.
- Exactly.

358
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:17,500
That's where they theft Rs.20.

359
00:27:17,583 --> 00:27:18,767
Who incurred loss in all this?

360
00:27:18,791 --> 00:27:20,500
- We have.
- You have.

361
00:27:20,666 --> 00:27:22,466
You didn't receive
appraisals from many years.

362
00:27:22,583 --> 00:27:24,791
But school fees have hiked by Rs.30.

363
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:28,333
You work hard for your
children's education.

364
00:27:28,416 --> 00:27:31,750
They are robbing your money..

365
00:27:31,833 --> 00:27:33,916
..as well as your children's future.

366
00:27:34,833 --> 00:27:36,073
Should we allow this to happen?

367
00:27:36,125 --> 00:27:37,208
Not at all.

368
00:27:37,291 --> 00:27:38,541
Should we allow this to happen?

369
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:39,875
Not at all.

370
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:43,500
I will not let them
infest the country.

371
00:27:43,583 --> 00:27:45,541
Gujarat will see the reformation.

372
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:46,875
Say with me.

373
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:48,333
Victory to Valiant Gujarat!

374
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:49,791
Victory to Valiant Gujarat!

375
00:27:49,875 --> 00:27:52,416
That year the movement was so intense..

376
00:27:52,708 --> 00:27:55,583
..that the chief minister
was forced to resign.

377
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:58,416
Total loss of 30 crores,
madam Prime Minister.

378
00:27:59,166 --> 00:28:02,875
I lost money but you lost
the government in Gujarat.

379
00:28:03,708 --> 00:28:04,875
All because of him.

380
00:28:07,125 --> 00:28:08,125
Who?

381
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:12,041
- Some Narendra..
- Narendra Damodardas Modi.

382
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:13,583
Remember his full name.

383
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,083
He has the capacity..

384
00:28:15,166 --> 00:28:16,666
..to erase your complete identity.

385
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:19,208
- Yes, dad.
- Mr. Reddy.

386
00:28:19,541 --> 00:28:21,666
Don't overreact.

387
00:28:22,541 --> 00:28:24,500
He's just an ordinary volunteer.

388
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:30,833
Include his name in the list
of important opposition leaders.

389
00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:33,625
We will see him.

390
00:28:33,916 --> 00:28:36,208
In no time you termed him
a leader from a volunteer.

391
00:28:36,958 --> 00:28:39,083
Swift promotion, isn't it?

392
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,666
Any information about?

393
00:28:43,083 --> 00:28:45,875
As per the intelligence reports,
he's in Delhi these days.

394
00:28:52,875 --> 00:28:54,291
Arrest him.

395
00:28:54,375 --> 00:28:55,375
Sure, madam.

396
00:28:57,916 --> 00:29:00,208
Give orders to the police
and the administration.

397
00:29:00,583 --> 00:29:02,250
To impose emergency from tomorrow.

398
00:29:13,458 --> 00:29:16,708
Police has arrested all our leaders.

399
00:29:16,791 --> 00:29:17,875
- What?
- Yes.

400
00:29:17,958 --> 00:29:20,250
More than one lakh
volunteers are arrested.

401
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:21,916
Without any court case.

402
00:29:22,416 --> 00:29:25,125
That's why the government
has put a ban on the press.

403
00:29:25,208 --> 00:29:27,833
We must do something big
to put an end to this emergency.

404
00:29:28,041 --> 00:29:29,916
Narendra, get them out of here, quickly.

405
00:29:30,375 --> 00:29:31,958
Police are here to arrest you.

406
00:29:32,041 --> 00:29:33,916
Come fast. Hurry up.

407
00:29:34,416 --> 00:29:35,958
Take him out quickly.

408
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:37,458
- Fast.
- Come on.

409
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:38,583
This way.

410
00:29:38,708 --> 00:29:40,083
There's a way on the backside.

411
00:29:40,458 --> 00:29:41,375
Come.

412
00:29:41,458 --> 00:29:42,625
Oh, police.

413
00:29:43,291 --> 00:29:44,541
Come here. Down.

414
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:46,916
Go that side.

415
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:49,833
- Raju, check that side.
- No use.

416
00:29:49,916 --> 00:29:52,291
The Police have cordoned the area.

417
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:54,541
Remove this. come on.

418
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:56,208
There's no way to go out.

419
00:29:57,958 --> 00:29:58,958
There's a way.

420
00:30:00,416 --> 00:30:01,958
But you will have to die for this.

421
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:06,166
Sir, it seems they are somewhere here.

422
00:30:06,541 --> 00:30:07,375
Search every house.

423
00:30:07,458 --> 00:30:09,142
There's only a common
gate for entry and exit.

424
00:30:09,166 --> 00:30:10,041
No one should escape.

425
00:30:10,125 --> 00:30:11,125
Go this way.

426
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,583
'God is the ultimate truth!'

427
00:30:12,666 --> 00:30:14,083
'God is the ultimate truth!'

428
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:15,500
'God is the ultimate truth!'

429
00:30:15,583 --> 00:30:18,583
- Come behind me.
- 'God is the ultimate truth!'

430
00:30:18,666 --> 00:30:20,000
'God is the ultimate truth!'

431
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:21,458
'God is the ultimate truth!'

432
00:30:21,541 --> 00:30:23,250
'God is the ultimate truth!'

433
00:30:23,333 --> 00:30:25,583
"Wide chest and doughty brain."

434
00:30:25,666 --> 00:30:28,041
"He alone has stirred the world."

435
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:30,750
"He's master of tricks.
No one can bring him on his knees."

436
00:30:30,833 --> 00:30:33,291
"His actions always
surprise everyone."

437
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:35,583
"Form the day one,
he had a vision.."

438
00:30:35,666 --> 00:30:38,375
"to reform India."

439
00:30:38,458 --> 00:30:40,791
"He's always energetic and inspiring."

440
00:30:40,875 --> 00:30:43,434
"He will evoke nationalism in the citizens.
And prove India's skills."

441
00:30:43,458 --> 00:30:45,833
"A word 'Namo'
will echo in the country."

442
00:30:45,916 --> 00:30:48,041
"No one will be in race with 'Namo'."

443
00:30:48,125 --> 00:30:49,708
Policeman's face was worth watching!

444
00:30:49,958 --> 00:30:51,166
Yes, we brought him out safe..

445
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,970
..right in front of
the entire police force.

446
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:54,875
Don't laugh. We haven't finished.

447
00:30:54,958 --> 00:30:56,083
This is just the beginning.

448
00:30:56,166 --> 00:30:58,708
We must bring forth our
point to the international media.

449
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:02,041
So that the world would
raise eyebrows at this emergency.

450
00:31:02,125 --> 00:31:03,845
But how do we reach
the international media?

451
00:31:04,458 --> 00:31:05,708
International conference.

452
00:31:08,208 --> 00:31:09,208
Have you gone mad?

453
00:31:09,916 --> 00:31:11,416
Police will be flocked over there.

454
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:17,083
Along with the media and
leaders from all over the world.

455
00:31:18,916 --> 00:31:20,541
But how do we reach there?

456
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:24,708
I will take you there.

457
00:31:26,458 --> 00:31:27,666
Do you trust me?

458
00:31:30,083 --> 00:31:35,083
"A word 'Namo' will echo in the country.
No one will be in race with 'Namo'."

459
00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:37,851
"He's master of tricks. No one can bring him on his knees."
- Stop him!

460
00:31:37,875 --> 00:31:40,333
"His actions always surprise everyone."

461
00:31:40,416 --> 00:31:42,625
"Form the day one,
he had a vision.."

462
00:31:42,708 --> 00:31:44,476
- "..to reform India."
- Pull the barricades quickly.

463
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,583
"He's always energetic
and inspiring."

464
00:31:46,666 --> 00:31:49,083
"He will evoke nationalism
in the citizens."

465
00:31:49,166 --> 00:31:50,333
"And prove India's skills."

466
00:31:50,416 --> 00:31:52,708
"The wounds are fresh."

467
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,375
"Live a little."

468
00:31:55,541 --> 00:31:57,541
- Hey.
- "Why shed tears?"

469
00:31:57,625 --> 00:32:00,185
How come so many 'sardars'
(Punjabi) have joined all of a sudden?

470
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,041
"The wounds are fresh."

471
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:05,541
"Live a little."

472
00:32:05,666 --> 00:32:08,666
"Why shed tears?"

473
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:10,833
Sir, there are many 'sardars'.

474
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,166
Which one I should arrest?

475
00:32:12,291 --> 00:32:13,375
Arrest everyone.

476
00:32:13,458 --> 00:32:14,625
'Whoever utters thy name...'

477
00:32:14,708 --> 00:32:16,458
'... shall triumph.'

478
00:32:16,541 --> 00:32:18,583
- "He moves forward fearlessly."
- Move.. move..

479
00:32:18,666 --> 00:32:20,333
Stop. Stop.

480
00:32:20,416 --> 00:32:23,250
Stop I say. Stop.

481
00:32:23,333 --> 00:32:25,333
Stop I say. Stop.

482
00:32:25,416 --> 00:32:28,541
Even if we reach there,
how do we enter inside?

483
00:32:28,625 --> 00:32:30,583
Police will be guarding every door.

484
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:33,875
Yes, but not every policeman..

485
00:32:34,375 --> 00:32:35,415
..will be in their favour.

486
00:32:43,666 --> 00:32:46,958
"He is an example,
a tea-seller leading the country."

487
00:32:47,041 --> 00:32:49,666
"He never turned back to see."

488
00:32:49,791 --> 00:32:52,958
"Do what you can."

489
00:32:53,666 --> 00:32:56,041
"His only dream is to take
India on number one position."

490
00:32:56,125 --> 00:32:59,291
"His speeches and eyes
reflect his aggression."

491
00:32:59,375 --> 00:33:03,666
"That's why millions
of people are in his support."

492
00:33:04,708 --> 00:33:09,583
You can neither suppress
our freedom nor our voice.

493
00:33:10,375 --> 00:33:12,083
All of you, the world leaders.

494
00:33:12,166 --> 00:33:14,458
Shame on you, for your silence.

495
00:33:14,958 --> 00:33:17,000
You claim to protect democracy?

496
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:19,125
But instead you protect
her dictatorship.

497
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:33,166
What are you doing?
Come on. Arrest them.

498
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:36,708
A hole is enough for a boat to sink.

499
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:38,666
That was an end of emergency.

500
00:33:39,208 --> 00:33:40,458
So was it for..

501
00:33:40,666 --> 00:33:42,583
..the congress government
as it collapsed..

502
00:33:42,666 --> 00:33:44,466
..for the first time
in the independent India.

503
00:33:51,708 --> 00:33:53,416
And in 1980..

504
00:33:53,875 --> 00:33:56,625
..a revolutionary thought
came into existence..

505
00:33:56,916 --> 00:33:59,791
Known as BJP.

506
00:34:00,041 --> 00:34:03,500
Idea is really good.
But what's the purpose of..

507
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,375
..this 'Rath Yatra'
(Religious procession)?

508
00:34:07,541 --> 00:34:09,375
I'm not against any religion.

509
00:34:10,125 --> 00:34:13,583
But is it wrong to take
proud of our own religion?

510
00:34:13,666 --> 00:34:14,458
Not at all.

511
00:34:14,541 --> 00:34:17,458
The only purpose is to
bring all the Hindus together.

512
00:34:17,541 --> 00:34:18,625
And give them a slogan.

513
00:34:18,708 --> 00:34:20,083
'Say with pride we are Hindus.'

514
00:34:20,375 --> 00:34:22,583
From Somnath to Ayodhya.

515
00:34:23,333 --> 00:34:26,083
How will our party
be able to organize..

516
00:34:26,166 --> 00:34:27,833
..this huge rally?

517
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:29,625
Who will do all this?

518
00:34:33,833 --> 00:34:34,833
There's one person.

519
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:38,490
He alone can handle everything.

520
00:34:38,916 --> 00:34:41,208
'Rath Yatra' instilled..

521
00:34:41,291 --> 00:34:43,166
..feeling of Hinduism in India.

522
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:45,666
People came in support of BJP..

523
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,041
..from every region of the country.

524
00:34:49,541 --> 00:34:50,708
Narendra.

525
00:34:50,958 --> 00:34:52,541
You've done wonders.

526
00:34:53,666 --> 00:34:55,916
Hindus from all over
the country have joined us.

527
00:34:59,208 --> 00:35:00,791
What are you thinking, son?

528
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,416
13.5 crores.

529
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,458
10 crores of Muslim,
2 crores of Christian.

530
00:35:06,541 --> 00:35:08,791
And 1.5 crores of Sikhs.

531
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:11,130
Till date, we couldn't connect with
all of them.

532
00:35:11,166 --> 00:35:13,250
So, what should we do?

533
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,916
National Integration
Rally for united India.

534
00:35:20,291 --> 00:35:21,083
Unified India.

535
00:35:21,166 --> 00:35:22,958
- United India.
- Unified India.

536
00:35:23,041 --> 00:35:24,583
- United India.
- Unified India.

537
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:26,083
- United India.
- Unified India.

538
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:27,583
- United India.
- Unified India.

539
00:35:27,666 --> 00:35:28,250
United India.

540
00:35:28,333 --> 00:35:30,583
We will not let India divide.

541
00:35:30,666 --> 00:35:32,333
We will not.

542
00:35:32,666 --> 00:35:34,500
Earlier they wanted Khalistan.

543
00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:37,958
Now, they want Kashmir
and form another Pakistan.

544
00:35:38,458 --> 00:35:41,125
Surrendering at terror today..

545
00:35:41,375 --> 00:35:43,500
..means losing our brave
soldiers in future.

546
00:35:43,958 --> 00:35:45,375
We are 86 crores.

547
00:35:45,458 --> 00:35:48,458
Together we will
protect this tricolor flag.

548
00:35:48,541 --> 00:35:51,083
The tricolor flag shall flutter
in every corner of our country.

549
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:53,958
India shall no longer fear terrorism..

550
00:35:54,333 --> 00:35:56,583
..but terrorism shall fear India.

551
00:36:26,375 --> 00:36:29,625
National integration
rally reached Kashmir.

552
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:30,625
What's your opinion on this?

553
00:36:30,708 --> 00:36:31,708
So who's responsible?

554
00:36:32,416 --> 00:36:34,083
Why do they ignite fire in Kashmir?

555
00:36:34,166 --> 00:36:36,208
Terrorists have lit Kashmir.

556
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:39,625
Every day they are demolishing
temples in Kashmir.

557
00:36:40,083 --> 00:36:41,625
Millions of local Kashmiri Pundits..

558
00:36:41,708 --> 00:36:43,708
..became refuge in their own country.

559
00:36:43,833 --> 00:36:45,625
Talks can resolve any issue.

560
00:36:46,583 --> 00:36:48,000
I will talk to Nawaz Sharif.

561
00:36:48,083 --> 00:36:50,958
Talks are going on from past 44 years.

562
00:36:51,666 --> 00:36:52,916
Stubborn people don't listen..

563
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,520
..till they have
a very good thrashing.

564
00:36:55,375 --> 00:36:57,666
Give a stern warning to Pakistan.

565
00:36:58,708 --> 00:37:02,375
Vacate Kashmir, or face our wrath.

566
00:37:02,458 --> 00:37:05,083
Do they want one
more war with Pakistan?

567
00:37:05,916 --> 00:37:07,791
I am the PM. I will handle everything.

568
00:37:08,583 --> 00:37:09,666
Although he's PM..

569
00:37:10,125 --> 00:37:13,541
..he can't buy a piece
of land in his own Kashmir.

570
00:37:13,833 --> 00:37:16,125
Section 370 must be removed.

571
00:37:16,208 --> 00:37:18,583
They are playing with
Kashmiri's emotions..

572
00:37:18,666 --> 00:37:20,583
..in the name of section 370.

573
00:37:20,666 --> 00:37:22,386
Now, it's the question
of India's emotions..

574
00:37:22,791 --> 00:37:24,666
..and not of the Kashmir alone.

575
00:37:25,333 --> 00:37:29,541
One nation,
one law, one tricolour flag.

576
00:37:33,791 --> 00:37:35,875
This press conference backfired on us.

577
00:37:36,541 --> 00:37:38,750
Sir, we must stop them.

578
00:37:38,833 --> 00:37:40,500
They are breaching the laws.

579
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,750
Order their arrest.

580
00:37:44,625 --> 00:37:46,000
He's arrested, sir.

581
00:37:46,208 --> 00:37:47,541
You arrested him..

582
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,250
..for he unfurled the
Tricolour flag and called for unity.

583
00:37:51,708 --> 00:37:52,916
Okay, set him free.

584
00:37:53,791 --> 00:37:54,583
Let him go to the Lal Chowk.

585
00:37:54,666 --> 00:37:55,958
And get shot by the terrorists.

586
00:37:56,583 --> 00:37:58,208
You've already made him a hero.

587
00:37:59,916 --> 00:38:01,796
Now, don't make a mistake
of proving him martyr.

588
00:38:02,416 --> 00:38:03,416
So, what should I do?

589
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,625
He shouldn't be arrested?

590
00:38:07,291 --> 00:38:09,583
Provide security and escort him?!

591
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:12,791
You must be proud of this uniform.

592
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:15,791
Proud as well as pained.

593
00:38:15,875 --> 00:38:16,625
Pain?

594
00:38:16,708 --> 00:38:18,625
We kill the terrorists.

595
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,875
But we can't even
touch these politicians..

596
00:38:20,958 --> 00:38:23,625
..and separatists who shelter them.

597
00:38:24,208 --> 00:38:26,791
We lay our life for
the nation with a smile.

598
00:38:27,083 --> 00:38:29,750
But when our people
throw stones at us..

599
00:38:29,833 --> 00:38:31,083
..its really heartbreaking.

600
00:38:32,125 --> 00:38:35,166
I salute your courage and patience.

601
00:38:35,541 --> 00:38:37,041
I've only one desire.

602
00:38:37,541 --> 00:38:40,208
To see a real man
as our Prime Minister.

603
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,041
The day he empowers us..

604
00:38:44,041 --> 00:38:46,666
..we will finish off these rogues.

605
00:38:47,666 --> 00:38:48,666
Jai Hind!

606
00:38:48,791 --> 00:38:49,791
Jai Hind!

607
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,250
They've either run away
or hiding somewhere nearby.

608
00:39:22,625 --> 00:39:24,000
Luckily no life is lost.

609
00:39:24,166 --> 00:39:25,666
You please return.

610
00:39:26,708 --> 00:39:27,708
No.

611
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:29,666
I will not.

612
00:39:30,375 --> 00:39:32,583
This isn't a civilian's job.

613
00:39:32,833 --> 00:39:34,000
We are the army personals.

614
00:39:34,083 --> 00:39:35,458
We are trained to embrace death.

615
00:39:35,541 --> 00:39:37,416
The only difference
between us is this uniform.

616
00:39:40,833 --> 00:39:42,333
This is the Lal Chowk.

617
00:39:43,333 --> 00:39:46,250
Right here,
they swear on dividing India.

618
00:39:46,833 --> 00:39:50,291
And openly set our
tricolor flag on fire.

619
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:54,666
I don't care if I lose my life..

620
00:39:55,791 --> 00:39:57,416
..but I will flutter
the tricolor flag.

621
00:40:44,416 --> 00:40:48,916
Glory to Mother India!

622
00:40:50,583 --> 00:40:53,041
Under the leadership
of Murli Manohar Joshi..

623
00:40:53,125 --> 00:40:57,000
..the National integration
rally organized by Narendra Modi..

624
00:40:57,375 --> 00:41:00,083
..promoted the integrality
of this country.

625
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:03,333
As a result, Narendra Modi
was given charge of..

626
00:41:03,416 --> 00:41:06,958
..election campaign for 1995,
Gujarat election.

627
00:41:07,875 --> 00:41:09,791
Hail Lord Shiva!

628
00:41:13,541 --> 00:41:14,541
Very good!

629
00:41:21,458 --> 00:41:25,041
Last time you had come
to collapse the government.

630
00:41:25,125 --> 00:41:27,250
And now you've come
to form the government.

631
00:41:27,416 --> 00:41:28,666
Very good.

632
00:41:29,458 --> 00:41:31,541
But it's a tough job, son.

633
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:35,333
Ever since independence,
no one could..

634
00:41:36,625 --> 00:41:40,208
..uproot congress from Gujarat.

635
00:41:40,291 --> 00:41:42,125
What are you saying, Vakilbabu?

636
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:45,166
You've eased many
impossible things.

637
00:41:45,333 --> 00:41:49,333
Yes, because Narendra was with me.

638
00:41:49,791 --> 00:41:51,041
Who do you have?

639
00:41:52,458 --> 00:41:54,098
I'm looking for someone
who can consider..

640
00:41:54,375 --> 00:41:57,666
..the party his family and
whose only motto is to serve people.

641
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,041
You can't look for such a person.

642
00:42:00,125 --> 00:42:01,375
You need to identify him.

643
00:42:01,458 --> 00:42:03,000
Tell me your problem.

644
00:42:03,208 --> 00:42:07,125
Sir, arrangements are done for
a free medical camp in our village.

645
00:42:07,333 --> 00:42:09,250
But we couldn't find a doctor as yet.

646
00:42:09,541 --> 00:42:11,833
Should I need to
find a doctor for you?

647
00:42:12,208 --> 00:42:13,208
Number 8.

648
00:42:14,125 --> 00:42:15,791
He isn't a number or a figure.

649
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:17,250
He's Mr. Anil.

650
00:42:17,833 --> 00:42:20,250
The dedicated party worker.

651
00:42:20,666 --> 00:42:22,250
But Mota bhai, for the election..

652
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:26,291
These workers' services will
help us win the election.

653
00:42:26,833 --> 00:42:29,208
These volunteers nurture the party.

654
00:42:29,583 --> 00:42:31,375
Learn to respect these volunteers.

655
00:42:31,458 --> 00:42:34,375
You've to identify them. Yes.

656
00:42:37,125 --> 00:42:39,250
- Narendra Modi.
- I know.

657
00:42:41,333 --> 00:42:44,166
Super hit pairs are matchless.

658
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:46,791
Like Tendulkar and Sehwag.

659
00:42:47,041 --> 00:42:49,166
Or Jay and Veeru.

660
00:42:49,583 --> 00:42:51,833
One such pair was formed.

661
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Excuse me.

662
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:06,250
Stop.

663
00:43:06,583 --> 00:43:07,875
Can we get some water please?

664
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:27,000
Hey, what are you doing?

665
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:28,958
You should not waste water.

666
00:43:29,041 --> 00:43:31,333
We walk 4 miles
under this scorching heat..

667
00:43:31,416 --> 00:43:34,583
..just to get 2 pots of
water for the entire family.

668
00:43:35,291 --> 00:43:36,291
Sorry, sister.

669
00:43:45,708 --> 00:43:48,583
But Naru,
why are we going to see Atulbhai?

670
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:51,083
He didn't win the last election.

671
00:43:51,166 --> 00:43:52,166
Yes.

672
00:43:52,416 --> 00:43:53,500
What yes?

673
00:43:54,625 --> 00:43:55,684
Instead of the winning members..

674
00:43:55,708 --> 00:43:57,166
..we are going to meet the loser.

675
00:43:57,416 --> 00:43:59,333
Because more than a winner..

676
00:43:59,416 --> 00:44:01,666
..a loser knows
the value of victory..

677
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:05,333
Wow, Atulbhai,
when did you win this trophy?

678
00:44:05,458 --> 00:44:07,458
In last year's cricket tournament..

679
00:44:07,541 --> 00:44:08,809
..I won the title of man of the match.

680
00:44:08,833 --> 00:44:09,541
I see.

681
00:44:09,833 --> 00:44:12,083
Atulbhai is not just a sportsman..

682
00:44:12,166 --> 00:44:13,434
..but he has immense
knowledge of cricket.

683
00:44:13,458 --> 00:44:14,458
- Really?
- Yes.

684
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:17,000
No, it's just like that.

685
00:44:17,166 --> 00:44:20,500
Okay, tell me who will
win the world cup this time?

686
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:23,125
India will.. I am confident.

687
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,291
This time our team is very strong.

688
00:44:25,375 --> 00:44:29,291
Who had won the world cup in 1992?

689
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:30,541
In 1992.

690
00:44:30,625 --> 00:44:33,208
- Pakistan.
- Yes.

691
00:44:34,166 --> 00:44:35,666
And who was the runner up?

692
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:37,083
Runner up?

693
00:44:37,166 --> 00:44:38,625
Leave it, Narendrabhai.

694
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,750
No one remembers the losers.

695
00:44:41,166 --> 00:44:42,333
Exactly my point.

696
00:44:44,333 --> 00:44:46,250
You lost the last election
by how many votes?

697
00:44:46,333 --> 00:44:49,500
9406 votes, right?

698
00:44:56,791 --> 00:44:58,991
Would you like to be the
man of the match in a big game?

699
00:45:02,625 --> 00:45:05,041
Narendrabhai, I am with you.

700
00:45:06,166 --> 00:45:09,333
But I've no money to
invest in the election.

701
00:45:09,625 --> 00:45:14,291
Atul, election is won by the people,
not by the money.

702
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:17,541
Narendrabhai,
I will also join hands with you.

703
00:45:17,625 --> 00:45:21,333
But how do we win
election without money?

704
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,416
I've a magical wand.

705
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,000
What are you saying, Narendrabhai?

706
00:45:26,166 --> 00:45:27,583
Magic to win election?

707
00:45:27,666 --> 00:45:28,666
Please share with us.

708
00:45:29,166 --> 00:45:31,000
I will share it at 7 AM..

709
00:45:31,083 --> 00:45:33,791
..tomorrow at 'Kala Dungar'.

710
00:45:33,916 --> 00:45:35,458
Where's Narendrabhai?

711
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:37,250
And where's his magic?

712
00:45:37,333 --> 00:45:38,125
Let's go.

713
00:45:38,208 --> 00:45:39,750
Hello, Atulbhai.

714
00:45:42,333 --> 00:45:44,333
This is the magic of winning election.

715
00:45:45,708 --> 00:45:47,333
It's called work.

716
00:45:48,125 --> 00:45:50,916
From generations, women walk
miles and miles to collect water.

717
00:45:51,541 --> 00:45:53,708
I thought I should
bring water to them now.

718
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:55,708
I am making a canal.

719
00:45:57,041 --> 00:45:58,500
What are you saying, Narendrabhai?

720
00:45:58,583 --> 00:46:00,343
Bringing water from
the distance of 4 miles..

721
00:46:00,416 --> 00:46:03,500
..will take a year
digging up alone like this.

722
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:05,625
Who said that I am alone?

723
00:46:08,333 --> 00:46:12,875
Sister, your life spent
in collecting water.

724
00:46:13,875 --> 00:46:16,000
Don't let that happen
with these girls.

725
00:46:16,583 --> 00:46:18,166
They should be in school.

726
00:46:18,666 --> 00:46:19,666
Am I right?

727
00:46:20,625 --> 00:46:21,958
Come on. - Pass that to me.

728
00:46:22,041 --> 00:46:23,541
Take it from there.

729
00:46:24,291 --> 00:46:25,416
Yes, come on.

730
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,083
- But Narendrabhai.
- Yes.

731
00:46:27,166 --> 00:46:28,416
This is Government's job.

732
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:32,458
Yes, but if we will
do the government's jobs..

733
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:34,458
..then we will form
the next government.

734
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:36,333
We won't ask for the votes.

735
00:46:37,166 --> 00:46:40,166
We will do the work. Votes will follow.

736
00:46:43,291 --> 00:46:44,333
- Come on.
- Let's go.

737
00:46:44,416 --> 00:46:49,041
"I take oath upon this soil."

738
00:46:49,541 --> 00:46:54,500
"I will not let this country to diminish."

739
00:46:54,916 --> 00:46:57,583
"I will not let this country to diminish."

740
00:46:57,666 --> 00:47:02,583
"I will not let the country bow."

741
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,416
"I take oath upon this soil."

742
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:09,625
"I will not let this country to diminish."

743
00:47:10,541 --> 00:47:18,125
"I will not let this country to diminish."

744
00:47:21,291 --> 00:47:28,041
"My motherland asks me when
you would repay your debts to me."

745
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:32,833
"My skies ask me when
you would fulfill your duty."

746
00:47:32,916 --> 00:47:34,791
- Narendrbhai.
- Yes.

747
00:47:34,875 --> 00:47:37,416
Even they wish to build
a canal in their village.

748
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:38,250
Sure.

749
00:47:38,333 --> 00:47:40,166
Okay, start working as of now.

750
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:42,458
"I've promised my mother India."

751
00:47:42,541 --> 00:47:47,000
"I won't let the blaze to be faded."

752
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:50,291
"I take oath upon this soil."

753
00:47:50,375 --> 00:47:52,833
"I will not let this country to diminish."

754
00:47:52,916 --> 00:47:55,625
"I will not let this country to diminish."

755
00:47:55,708 --> 00:48:00,291
"I will not let the country bow."

756
00:48:07,041 --> 00:48:09,125
This time Narendrabhai
has really worked hard..

757
00:48:09,208 --> 00:48:10,208
..Karsanbhai.

758
00:48:10,708 --> 00:48:13,125
You'll surely become the CM this time.

759
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,291
Stop dreaming.

760
00:48:15,375 --> 00:48:18,375
I think we will have
to go into farming again.

761
00:48:19,291 --> 00:48:21,208
More than 200 people
have come to cast votes..

762
00:48:21,291 --> 00:48:23,375
..for the opposition
party since this morning.

763
00:48:24,041 --> 00:48:25,875
Not even 20 have come
to cast votes for us.

764
00:48:26,833 --> 00:48:31,083
I told you, no
one can win election without money.

765
00:48:31,166 --> 00:48:32,208
But you all ignored it.

766
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:39,916
Karsanbhai,
victory is enjoyed all the more..

767
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,333
..when people expect your defeat.

768
00:48:46,541 --> 00:48:48,583
Votes will come automatically.

769
00:49:15,166 --> 00:49:17,416
Vote for the name I suggest.

770
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:20,000
Here are sarees for you
and dress for your husband.

771
00:49:20,083 --> 00:49:22,208
Get away. We don't want all this.

772
00:49:22,291 --> 00:49:24,291
We've come for Narendrabhai.

773
00:49:25,541 --> 00:49:26,291
Narendrabhai.

774
00:49:26,375 --> 00:49:28,666
We will vote for the name you suggest.

775
00:49:30,333 --> 00:49:34,458
Till date women have
suffered the most.

776
00:49:35,208 --> 00:49:37,333
But you brought water to our village.

777
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:40,166
Should we vote for Lotus?

778
00:49:41,791 --> 00:49:46,208
Just one step is needed for the
journey of thousands of miles.

779
00:49:46,666 --> 00:49:50,458
BJP took that first step in Gujarat.

780
00:49:51,875 --> 00:49:54,500
First time Lotus won
in the desert regions.

781
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,500
And BJP formed government in Gujarat.

782
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,333
Modi. Modi.

783
00:50:14,416 --> 00:50:16,166
Modi. Modi.

784
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:18,041
Modi. Modi.

785
00:50:18,125 --> 00:50:19,875
Modi. Modi.

786
00:50:19,958 --> 00:50:21,208
Modi. Modi.

787
00:50:21,291 --> 00:50:23,208
Modi. Modi.

788
00:50:23,458 --> 00:50:25,250
Modi. Modi.

789
00:50:25,333 --> 00:50:27,041
Modi. Modi.

790
00:50:27,125 --> 00:50:28,833
Modi. Modi.

791
00:50:28,916 --> 00:50:30,541
Modi. Modi.

792
00:50:30,666 --> 00:50:32,291
Modi. Modi.

793
00:50:32,375 --> 00:50:35,000
Modi. Modi.

794
00:50:35,083 --> 00:50:37,041
Modi. Modi.

795
00:50:37,125 --> 00:50:39,291
Modi. Modi.

796
00:50:56,833 --> 00:51:00,833
First of all, I want to
thank you for coming here.

797
00:51:01,166 --> 00:51:02,208
Tell me.

798
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:07,833
You know my father
had built this stadium.

799
00:51:08,208 --> 00:51:12,875
I've seen nine CM in
Gujarat in past 35 years.

800
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:14,666
You're the tenth one.

801
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:16,083
Don't worry about the funding.

802
00:51:17,083 --> 00:51:18,208
You will get it on time.

803
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:21,208
May it be for the party..

804
00:51:21,291 --> 00:51:22,708
..or personal.

805
00:51:23,041 --> 00:51:24,916
Just make sure that
our files get a go ahead.

806
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:30,625
Should I discuss all this
with you or with Narendra Modi?

807
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:33,250
Why him?

808
00:51:35,083 --> 00:51:37,833
I'm the CM. Who is he?

809
00:51:37,916 --> 00:51:39,676
The one who made your
way to the chair of CM.

810
00:51:39,708 --> 00:51:41,291
People say this.

811
00:51:42,708 --> 00:51:46,291
That you're CM and he's super CM.

812
00:51:51,083 --> 00:51:54,541
My MLAs and I feel..

813
00:51:54,625 --> 00:51:56,958
..that two CMs can't occupy one chair.

814
00:51:57,083 --> 00:52:00,333
You want to kick him off who
Got you elected?

815
00:52:00,625 --> 00:52:01,708
Think again.

816
00:52:02,125 --> 00:52:04,583
Can you afford to lose
one man or break the party?

817
00:52:04,875 --> 00:52:05,875
Look..

818
00:52:09,666 --> 00:52:12,041
Come.. come, Narendra.

819
00:52:15,291 --> 00:52:19,791
In the interest of the party,
I want you..

820
00:52:20,791 --> 00:52:25,916
..to go to Delhi
and take up new responsibilities.

821
00:52:30,583 --> 00:52:35,500
Yes, Narendra. Karasanbhai
will handle everything over here.

822
00:52:38,875 --> 00:52:40,625
You want me to leave Gujarat.

823
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:50,291
You know better than me.

824
00:52:50,875 --> 00:52:52,115
The most suitable place for me.

825
00:53:01,291 --> 00:53:03,375
This is absolutely wrong.

826
00:53:04,083 --> 00:53:05,333
What will you do now?

827
00:53:08,625 --> 00:53:09,625
Work.

828
00:53:27,958 --> 00:53:29,041
Quick. Quick!

829
00:53:29,333 --> 00:53:32,208
Doctor! Take him to
the medical camp. Quick.

830
00:53:32,458 --> 00:53:33,875
Hey, hurry up.

831
00:53:33,958 --> 00:53:34,416
Hello.

832
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:38,333
I know you're ordered
not to come to Gujarat.

833
00:53:38,708 --> 00:53:40,791
But the motherland is above all.

834
00:53:41,083 --> 00:53:43,125
And Gujarat needs you.

835
00:53:43,375 --> 00:53:44,875
You will have to come here.

836
00:55:05,833 --> 00:55:06,875
Yes.

837
00:55:08,416 --> 00:55:09,416
Yes.

838
00:55:10,875 --> 00:55:11,875
Right now?

839
00:55:14,708 --> 00:55:17,583
Take this. How are you now?

840
00:55:19,958 --> 00:55:20,666
Narendrabhai.

841
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:21,750
Yes.

842
00:55:22,875 --> 00:55:24,083
They want you in Gandhinagar.

843
00:55:24,416 --> 00:55:25,416
Right now.

844
00:55:28,083 --> 00:55:30,708
Narendrabhai,
you had to go against party orders..

845
00:55:30,791 --> 00:55:32,625
..and come here for my sake.

846
00:55:33,333 --> 00:55:34,333
No.

847
00:55:35,041 --> 00:55:36,291
For the sake of Gujarat.

848
00:55:49,625 --> 00:55:50,750
Narendra.

849
00:55:51,041 --> 00:55:53,041
In past five years..

850
00:55:53,125 --> 00:55:58,791
..we've noticed your selfless
service to the party.

851
00:55:59,666 --> 00:56:02,750
Delhi, Himachal Pradesh.

852
00:56:02,833 --> 00:56:03,875
And Haryana.

853
00:56:04,958 --> 00:56:10,000
Now, we need you in Gujarat.

854
00:56:10,083 --> 00:56:15,791
So, we want you to be the CM.

855
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:19,833
You know better than me.

856
00:56:20,083 --> 00:56:21,625
The most suitable place for me.

857
00:56:36,166 --> 00:56:37,708
Narendrabhai, please consider it.

858
00:56:38,583 --> 00:56:39,916
Aditya Vardhan Reddy.

859
00:56:40,708 --> 00:56:42,958
Earlier you were
with that party, right?

860
00:56:43,208 --> 00:56:44,250
That was in past.

861
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:46,541
At present you are in power.

862
00:56:47,166 --> 00:56:50,333
Where there's power, there we are.

863
00:56:51,583 --> 00:56:53,416
By the way, what are you into?

864
00:56:53,625 --> 00:56:55,666
Business or politics?

865
00:56:57,375 --> 00:56:59,333
I am in the business of politics.

866
00:57:00,541 --> 00:57:01,958
CM will come soon.

867
00:57:05,625 --> 00:57:07,458
I want to see him in private.

868
00:57:08,291 --> 00:57:10,750
From more than 2 hours VVIPs..

869
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,309
..of the country are waiting for you.

870
00:57:12,333 --> 00:57:17,375
And CM sir is busy with the public.

871
00:57:18,333 --> 00:57:20,083
For your knowledge..

872
00:57:20,458 --> 00:57:24,625
..my party name is Bhartiya
Janta Party. (Indian people's party).

873
00:57:26,958 --> 00:57:28,083
Look, sir.

874
00:57:29,208 --> 00:57:30,708
I'm a man of the numbers.

875
00:57:32,333 --> 00:57:36,875
From past 40 years,
I've witnessed 13 CM in Gujarat.

876
00:57:36,958 --> 00:57:38,000
You're the 14th one.

877
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:42,208
Just that your co-operation and..

878
00:57:42,583 --> 00:57:45,166
..my business should
go on uninterruptedly.

879
00:57:46,708 --> 00:57:48,375
Party will be funded nonstop.

880
00:57:48,458 --> 00:57:50,541
And obviously, to you as well.

881
00:57:53,416 --> 00:57:55,375
You're running 14
companies in Gujarat.

882
00:57:56,083 --> 00:57:58,541
3 are running upto the standard.

883
00:57:59,166 --> 00:58:01,125
But 11 are not.

884
00:58:03,416 --> 00:58:05,958
Mr. Reddy,
you're making ample of money.

885
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:08,875
But now the watchman is here.

886
00:58:14,625 --> 00:58:16,375
You like the figures, right?

887
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:18,666
Eleven.

888
00:58:19,208 --> 00:58:23,958
I will shut down your
11 companies in next 11 days.

889
00:58:27,625 --> 00:58:31,708
Okay, let's talk openly.

890
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:33,750
What do you want?

891
00:58:34,166 --> 00:58:37,666
They don't expect anything
who love the nation.

892
00:58:37,958 --> 00:58:40,000
Each and every thing
comes with a price.

893
00:58:40,416 --> 00:58:43,375
May it be in the market
or in the government.

894
00:58:43,458 --> 00:58:46,500
This government will shut your market.

895
00:58:50,166 --> 00:58:52,375
I will let the business
prosper in Gujarat.

896
00:58:53,208 --> 00:58:54,958
But will not sale
Gujarat ever in life.

897
00:58:55,583 --> 00:58:58,541
My Gujarat is not for sale.

898
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Jai Hind!

899
00:59:12,375 --> 00:59:16,666
You were right, dad.
I must remember his full name.

900
00:59:18,583 --> 00:59:23,083
Narendra Damodardas Modi.

901
00:59:23,958 --> 00:59:26,041
I will demolish your government.

902
00:59:26,625 --> 00:59:30,583
Just a spark is enough
to light up the fire.

903
00:59:32,291 --> 00:59:34,625
Humanity was lost.

904
00:59:34,833 --> 00:59:37,583
On that day, when people
forgot brotherhood.

905
00:59:37,666 --> 00:59:40,333
Sir 69 Hindus are burnt
alive in Sabarmati express.

906
00:59:40,416 --> 00:59:42,166
Riots broke in Gujarat, sir.

907
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,351
- Did you take your books?
- Listen to your mom.

908
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:50,833
Yes, mom.

909
00:59:51,083 --> 00:59:52,958
Okay, say goodbye to mom?

910
00:59:53,041 --> 00:59:54,958
- Bye, mom.
- Bye.

911
00:59:55,041 --> 00:59:57,541
- You're very small, son.
- Hello.

912
00:59:58,041 --> 00:59:58,875
Come.

913
00:59:58,958 --> 01:00:01,083
Baby, here comes your friend.

914
01:00:01,416 --> 01:00:02,625
Okay, Salimbhai.

915
01:00:02,708 --> 01:00:04,250
- Bye.
- Bye.

916
01:00:04,333 --> 01:00:04,916
Bye.

917
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,291
Bye, dad.

918
01:00:07,958 --> 01:00:09,208
Breaking news.

919
01:00:09,291 --> 01:00:11,375
After Sabarmati express
was set on fire..

920
01:00:11,458 --> 01:00:13,250
..Hindus have taken up the weapons.

921
01:00:13,333 --> 01:00:14,958
Riots broke in the entire state.

922
01:00:42,291 --> 01:00:43,666
Are you alright, brother?

923
01:00:54,625 --> 01:00:58,166
Hail Lord Rama!

924
01:00:58,375 --> 01:01:02,083
Hail Lord Rama!

925
01:01:02,166 --> 01:01:05,583
Hail Lord Rama!

926
01:01:05,666 --> 01:01:08,375
Hail Lord Rama!

927
01:01:08,458 --> 01:01:11,583
Hail Lord Rama!

928
01:01:11,666 --> 01:01:14,250
Hail Lord Rama!

929
01:01:14,875 --> 01:01:16,416
Thank you, God!

930
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:19,000
Gujarat needs your help.

931
01:01:19,208 --> 01:01:21,875
Send the rapid action
forces quickly. Yes.

932
01:01:22,416 --> 01:01:24,267
I had asked for the reserved
forces from Maharashtra's CM.

933
01:01:24,291 --> 01:01:24,708
What's the update?

934
01:01:24,791 --> 01:01:27,083
I'm following up since
this morning but no response.

935
01:01:27,208 --> 01:01:29,048
They are doing politics
even in this situation?

936
01:01:29,333 --> 01:01:30,166
Call up the DG.

937
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:31,250
Yes.

938
01:02:19,541 --> 01:02:21,684
When will the police from
Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh arrive?

939
01:02:21,708 --> 01:02:23,250
No response from both the states.

940
01:02:23,333 --> 01:02:24,000
- Joshi.
- Yes.

941
01:02:24,083 --> 01:02:25,892
Make me talk to the chief
ministers of both the states again.

942
01:02:25,916 --> 01:02:27,059
- Yes.
- I will request them again.

943
01:02:27,083 --> 01:02:27,500
Okay.

944
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:28,291
Our police force?

945
01:02:28,375 --> 01:02:30,375
Sir, the entire police
force is deployed.

946
01:02:30,458 --> 01:02:32,138
I will personally
visit the affected areas.

947
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:22,958
"Lord Rama, the Lord of heavens."

948
01:03:23,041 --> 01:03:29,791
"Blessed is thy name."

949
01:04:05,958 --> 01:04:08,750
Whether the other states'
police help us or not.

950
01:04:08,916 --> 01:04:10,851
Whether the paramilitary
forces reach here or not.

951
01:04:10,875 --> 01:04:12,375
We will stop these riots.

952
01:04:12,541 --> 01:04:13,541
We will stop it.

953
01:04:13,791 --> 01:04:15,500
Impose curfew in the entire state.

954
01:04:15,833 --> 01:04:18,291
Send every rioter behind bars.

955
01:04:20,666 --> 01:04:22,333
My Gujarat is burning.

956
01:04:32,958 --> 01:04:35,541
The Gujarat government has setup
Relief camps everywhere

957
01:04:35,625 --> 01:04:37,583
The number of casualties
has reached 1000.

958
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:40,583
This is an opportunity
to collapse Modi's government.

959
01:04:40,666 --> 01:04:41,500
Narendra Modi has..

960
01:04:41,583 --> 01:04:43,892
- ..requested the government to remain calm.
- Don't miss it.

961
01:04:43,916 --> 01:04:45,125
Sure, sir.

962
01:04:47,541 --> 01:04:50,250
Police are arresting
rioters on the spot.

963
01:04:50,458 --> 01:04:51,500
People want to know.

964
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,125
Why CM of Gujarat
has blindfolded his eyes?

965
01:04:55,208 --> 01:04:58,125
For the first time riots
are under control within 24 hours.

966
01:04:58,208 --> 01:05:00,166
Actually, Gujarat Police
didn't take action.

967
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:02,958
Modiji didn't want
police to take action.

968
01:05:03,333 --> 01:05:04,500
If what you say is correct..

969
01:05:04,583 --> 01:05:06,434
..then Modiji wouldn't
ask for the police force..

970
01:05:06,458 --> 01:05:08,500
..from the neighbouring states.

971
01:05:08,583 --> 01:05:10,392
Unfortunately,
he didn't get any help from them.

972
01:05:10,416 --> 01:05:12,500
Because, your party was in power..

973
01:05:12,583 --> 01:05:13,809
..in all the neighbouring states.

974
01:05:13,833 --> 01:05:16,083
Your news channel didn't
throw any light on this.

975
01:05:16,166 --> 01:05:20,125
Anyway, tell me where's
your chief minister right now?

976
01:05:20,208 --> 01:05:21,291
What's he doing?

977
01:05:23,041 --> 01:05:25,875
Gujarat government has put
up relief camps at many places.

978
01:05:25,958 --> 01:05:29,708
1000 died and more
than 2500 are injured.

979
01:05:29,791 --> 01:05:32,875
Narendra Modi has appealed
people to maintain peace.

980
01:05:33,041 --> 01:05:35,083
Curfew is still imposed
in many parts of the state.

981
01:05:35,250 --> 01:05:38,125
Rioters are being
arrested on the spot.

982
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,541
We are managing somehow.

983
01:05:54,875 --> 01:05:58,125
We will need more doctors
and medical teams.

984
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:02,916
Hello.

985
01:06:11,791 --> 01:06:12,875
Force has reached.

986
01:06:12,958 --> 01:06:14,541
Riots are under control.

987
01:06:15,166 --> 01:06:16,916
1044 are dead.

988
01:06:17,333 --> 01:06:19,916
790 Muslims and 254 Hindus, sir.

989
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:21,958
- Number of injured are..
- Enough.

990
01:06:24,375 --> 01:06:26,041
How long will you divide them?

991
01:06:27,375 --> 01:06:29,166
Spare them after the death.

992
01:06:31,041 --> 01:06:32,875
No Hindus and no Muslims.

993
01:06:33,708 --> 01:06:36,791
1044 Gujaratis are dead.

994
01:06:37,666 --> 01:06:39,125
My people died.

995
01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:41,250
Sorry, sir.

996
01:06:52,375 --> 01:06:53,375
No.

997
01:06:54,541 --> 01:06:55,541
My son.

998
01:06:55,916 --> 01:06:57,291
My small child.

999
01:06:57,833 --> 01:06:58,833
My son.

1000
01:06:58,875 --> 01:07:00,416
Return my child to me.

1001
01:07:00,541 --> 01:07:02,250
Return my child to me.

1002
01:07:12,375 --> 01:07:13,583
My child.

1003
01:07:13,666 --> 01:07:14,791
My child.

1004
01:07:17,041 --> 01:07:21,083
I can't change what has happened.

1005
01:07:22,833 --> 01:07:24,541
But I promise you.

1006
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:28,166
As long as I am alive..

1007
01:07:29,541 --> 01:07:33,958
..I will not let the
riots break again in Gujarat.

1008
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:38,125
Sir, opposition says
that he's behind the riots.

1009
01:07:38,416 --> 01:07:40,351
Now, he's just doing a
charade to control the situation.

1010
01:07:40,375 --> 01:07:41,500
You're secular, sir.

1011
01:07:41,916 --> 01:07:43,458
How did this happen in your presence?

1012
01:07:43,833 --> 01:07:48,458
This incidence is
a stigma on our nation.

1013
01:07:48,750 --> 01:07:50,875
There should be no discrimination..

1014
01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:53,583
..in the name of religion or caste.

1015
01:07:53,916 --> 01:07:55,958
I've said the same thing to Narendra.

1016
01:07:56,666 --> 01:07:59,958
He should follow his duty.

1017
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:01,875
And that's what he has done.

1018
01:08:02,708 --> 01:08:04,458
But that will be possible..

1019
01:08:05,041 --> 01:08:06,916
..only when Narendra Modi will resign.

1020
01:08:14,791 --> 01:08:16,375
This party is my family.

1021
01:08:18,583 --> 01:08:20,583
And I regard you like my father.

1022
01:08:22,041 --> 01:08:24,541
I can't tolerate if a
finger is pointed at you..

1023
01:08:25,416 --> 01:08:26,791
..because of me.

1024
01:08:33,333 --> 01:08:34,333
Resignation.

1025
01:08:44,833 --> 01:08:46,458
This is injustice with Narendra.

1026
01:08:47,375 --> 01:08:49,125
Within six months
of his rule as a CM..

1027
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:50,333
..Godhra incidence happened.

1028
01:08:50,833 --> 01:08:51,583
Why?

1029
01:08:51,666 --> 01:08:54,833
The riots broke out of the rage
as the train bogie was set afire.

1030
01:08:55,166 --> 01:08:57,333
Narendra had arrested..

1031
01:08:57,416 --> 01:08:59,375
..25 thousand people
and controlled the riots.

1032
01:09:00,583 --> 01:09:03,708
You know this is
oppositions' conspiracy..

1033
01:09:03,791 --> 01:09:05,166
..to collapse our government.

1034
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:06,333
You're right.

1035
01:09:07,833 --> 01:09:10,208
I will never let this happen.

1036
01:09:12,583 --> 01:09:14,791
Narendra Modi continues
to be the CM of Gujarat.

1037
01:09:15,583 --> 01:09:17,666
Resignation was just a charade.

1038
01:09:18,208 --> 01:09:19,375
And it is clear..

1039
01:09:21,041 --> 01:09:22,250
Salutations, brother Masood.

1040
01:09:22,333 --> 01:09:23,791
Hello.

1041
01:09:28,041 --> 01:09:29,083
This isn't good.

1042
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:32,333
700 Muslims are killed in Gujarat.

1043
01:09:32,541 --> 01:09:33,666
It's good for us.

1044
01:09:35,125 --> 01:09:36,125
700 died.

1045
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:40,000
Now 7000 Jihadis will
be born for Jaish-e-Mohammad.

1046
01:09:40,166 --> 01:09:45,416
This is the right chance to
turn Gujarat into another Kashmir.

1047
01:09:45,625 --> 01:09:47,083
Are your boys ready?

1048
01:09:50,333 --> 01:09:51,333
Target?

1049
01:10:40,458 --> 01:10:41,458
Hello.

1050
01:10:41,583 --> 01:10:42,625
Chief minister office!

1051
01:10:42,708 --> 01:10:44,458
Terrorists have entered Akshardham.

1052
01:10:44,541 --> 01:10:46,021
Many are caught up here.
We need help.

1053
01:10:56,458 --> 01:10:59,458
- Try to understand..
- Sir, please don't go inside.

1054
01:11:05,416 --> 01:11:11,625
The people want to know.
What's going on in Gujarat?

1055
01:11:29,833 --> 01:11:31,541
No. No. No.

1056
01:11:38,083 --> 01:11:38,958
What has happened?

1057
01:11:39,041 --> 01:11:41,208
They suddenly entered and opened fire.

1058
01:11:41,291 --> 01:11:43,500
By the grace of God, we came out safe.

1059
01:11:43,583 --> 01:11:46,125
As you heard,
many people are still trapped inside.

1060
01:11:46,208 --> 01:11:48,625
Let's see what steps Gujarat CM..

1061
01:11:48,708 --> 01:11:51,458
..Narendra Modi takes
to bring them out safe.

1062
01:12:05,916 --> 01:12:07,166
Sources say..

1063
01:12:07,250 --> 01:12:10,833
..there are two terrorists inside.

1064
01:12:10,916 --> 01:12:13,333
Thankfully, NSG team is here.

1065
01:12:18,541 --> 01:12:21,208
First and most important point.

1066
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:24,916
Bring out the trapped devotees safely.

1067
01:12:52,250 --> 01:12:55,666
Sir, you're standing here all night.

1068
01:12:56,875 --> 01:12:58,250
Take some rest.

1069
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:05,583
Joshi, will the families
of trapped ones be able to rest?

1070
01:13:24,166 --> 01:13:26,666
Sir, mission successful.

1071
01:13:27,416 --> 01:13:28,625
Target eliminated.

1072
01:13:31,583 --> 01:13:37,666
My mother is inside.
I'm trying to contact her but..

1073
01:13:37,750 --> 01:13:41,333
I want to know about
my son Vikas, please.

1074
01:13:42,791 --> 01:13:43,291
Run.

1075
01:13:43,375 --> 01:13:45,708
Please call my husband.

1076
01:13:45,791 --> 01:13:47,583
Hey.. Vikas.

1077
01:13:47,666 --> 01:13:50,125
Where is the doctor?

1078
01:13:54,208 --> 01:13:56,041
- No. - Swami.
- No, son.

1079
01:13:56,166 --> 01:13:57,333
Everything will be alright.

1080
01:13:57,583 --> 01:14:00,125
Both the terrorists were Muslims.

1081
01:14:00,416 --> 01:14:02,916
Godhra like situation is created
in Gujarat after this news.

1082
01:14:03,250 --> 01:14:04,791
Riots can break in Gujarat again.

1083
01:14:04,875 --> 01:14:05,333
Almighty.

1084
01:14:05,416 --> 01:14:07,101
20 dead bodies are
recovered from Akshardham.

1085
01:14:07,125 --> 01:14:09,625
I hope once again..
- More than 70 are injured.

1086
01:14:10,625 --> 01:14:11,791
No.. no..

1087
01:14:11,875 --> 01:14:12,916
Swami.

1088
01:14:13,125 --> 01:14:15,541
- Are you alright?
- Everything will be fine.

1089
01:14:16,875 --> 01:14:18,291
Sir.

1090
01:14:19,291 --> 01:14:20,500
Sir, there's a big problem.

1091
01:14:20,666 --> 01:14:23,000
Sir, some irresponsible
media have publicized news..

1092
01:14:23,166 --> 01:14:24,708
..about terrorist's religion.

1093
01:14:24,916 --> 01:14:27,596
Once again, the situation like
Godhra can erupt in all over Gujarat.

1094
01:14:28,458 --> 01:14:31,250
No, I won't let that happen.

1095
01:14:31,583 --> 01:14:32,663
Talk to the state's police.

1096
01:14:32,916 --> 01:14:33,916
Talk to the paramilitary.

1097
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,280
Talk to the reserved forces. Go.

1098
01:14:35,666 --> 01:14:36,666
Yes, sir.

1099
01:14:39,916 --> 01:14:41,208
Talk to the public.

1100
01:14:53,250 --> 01:14:55,125
Sir. Sir.

1101
01:14:55,208 --> 01:14:56,416
Sir, please tell us.

1102
01:14:56,541 --> 01:14:57,767
Sir, we heard riots can breakout..

1103
01:14:57,791 --> 01:14:58,976
..because of this terrorist attack.

1104
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,375
Are you all saying this?

1105
01:15:02,625 --> 01:15:04,125
Not because of the terrorists.

1106
01:15:05,333 --> 01:15:06,541
But because of you all.

1107
01:15:07,541 --> 01:15:08,708
Because of all of us.

1108
01:15:09,958 --> 01:15:12,625
How long we will divide
in the name of religion and caste?

1109
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:14,750
How long?

1110
01:15:16,083 --> 01:15:17,083
They are dividing us.

1111
01:15:18,208 --> 01:15:20,625
But we are breaking
the country into pieces.

1112
01:15:22,416 --> 01:15:23,833
First British divided us.

1113
01:15:24,125 --> 01:15:25,708
I am Hindu. You're Muslim.

1114
01:15:25,875 --> 01:15:27,208
He's 'Dalit' and he's 'Yadav'.

1115
01:15:27,375 --> 01:15:29,291
Some are Sikh and
some are south Indians.

1116
01:15:30,041 --> 01:15:33,041
With this strategy they
ruled over us for 300 years.

1117
01:15:33,875 --> 01:15:35,125
But we didn't learn anything.

1118
01:15:38,041 --> 01:15:42,208
What I regret is that
Hindustan is formed..

1119
01:15:42,916 --> 01:15:45,000
..but we couldn't be
the Hindustani by heart.

1120
01:15:45,583 --> 01:15:47,833
We still introduce ourselves
as Hindu and Muslim.

1121
01:15:50,833 --> 01:15:52,666
Listen to me carefully.

1122
01:15:53,583 --> 01:15:56,291
Today, if you take
up the weapon in hand..

1123
01:15:57,250 --> 01:15:59,809
..it will clearly mean that you are
not fighting for your religion..

1124
01:15:59,833 --> 01:16:01,250
..but for Pakistan.

1125
01:16:05,625 --> 01:16:07,125
This is exactly what they want.

1126
01:16:08,583 --> 01:16:09,666
Remember this.

1127
01:16:14,083 --> 01:16:16,375
This is my warning to Pakistan.

1128
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,333
If ever they dare attack on us again..

1129
01:16:21,458 --> 01:16:23,291
..I will destroy them completely.

1130
01:16:24,583 --> 01:16:26,583
They've seen our sacrifices.

1131
01:16:28,375 --> 01:16:29,958
Now, they will see our revenge.

1132
01:16:30,416 --> 01:16:31,416
Azhar sir.

1133
01:16:31,833 --> 01:16:33,375
Both your boys are gunned down.

1134
01:17:06,541 --> 01:17:12,083
Sir, you kept your promise.

1135
01:17:13,541 --> 01:17:15,041
Entire Gujarat is with you.

1136
01:17:17,583 --> 01:17:18,583
I salute you.

1137
01:17:19,375 --> 01:17:20,375
I salute you.

1138
01:18:13,041 --> 01:18:16,041
Narendra Modi was
known as parachute CM..

1139
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:18,541
..but now he's known as People's CM.

1140
01:18:18,875 --> 01:18:21,500
The way he has handled
the Akshardham's incidence..

1141
01:18:21,583 --> 01:18:25,208
..and his work in the direction
of development of Gujarat..

1142
01:18:25,333 --> 01:18:27,875
..have helped him receive
immense love from people.

1143
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:29,750
Hello.

1144
01:18:30,250 --> 01:18:31,291
Tell me one thing.

1145
01:18:31,666 --> 01:18:35,166
Does your CM work for
minorities development as well?

1146
01:18:38,875 --> 01:18:39,583
No.

1147
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:44,166
Do you feel safe in Gujarat?

1148
01:18:45,666 --> 01:18:46,500
Modi!

1149
01:18:46,583 --> 01:18:47,375
Modi!

1150
01:18:47,458 --> 01:18:48,291
Modi!

1151
01:18:48,375 --> 01:18:48,875
Modi!

1152
01:18:48,958 --> 01:18:50,541
Look, you misunderstand.

1153
01:18:50,625 --> 01:18:52,583
I... I... I didn't mean that.

1154
01:18:53,375 --> 01:18:54,375
What... what is this...

1155
01:18:54,416 --> 01:18:55,750
Let's go.

1156
01:18:58,708 --> 01:19:00,000
Hold this.

1157
01:19:13,708 --> 01:19:14,541
Sir, there's a problem.

1158
01:19:14,625 --> 01:19:15,625
Tell me quickly.

1159
01:19:15,708 --> 01:19:17,916
Sir, I thought they
will speak against Modi.

1160
01:19:18,083 --> 01:19:21,375
But they are all talking
in favour of Modi.

1161
01:19:21,458 --> 01:19:22,625
Just edit it off.

1162
01:19:22,833 --> 01:19:24,875
- Sir, it was live.
- What?

1163
01:19:27,041 --> 01:19:30,708
Sometimes I feel you're a
big waste of my time and money.

1164
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,000
I am..

1165
01:19:37,416 --> 01:19:39,833
I am so sorry to have
kept you waiting so long.

1166
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:41,666
Sir, I want your help.

1167
01:19:42,416 --> 01:19:43,875
Modi has stopped all our projects..

1168
01:19:43,958 --> 01:19:45,833
..in Gujarat from past 2 years.

1169
01:19:46,125 --> 01:19:50,041
Moreover, he has started
investigation on the land deal.

1170
01:19:50,416 --> 01:19:52,833
You will have to intervene.

1171
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:57,750
Sir, land issues are handled
by the state government.

1172
01:19:58,541 --> 01:19:59,833
We can't help in this matter.

1173
01:20:01,125 --> 01:20:02,833
Sir, you're government of India.

1174
01:20:03,625 --> 01:20:05,500
You can put pressure
on Gujarat government.

1175
01:20:07,166 --> 01:20:08,833
If media comes to know..

1176
01:20:10,375 --> 01:20:11,583
..it will land us in trouble.

1177
01:20:11,750 --> 01:20:15,083
Sir, my partners and
I've invested a huge amount.

1178
01:20:16,250 --> 01:20:17,250
You..

1179
01:20:17,791 --> 01:20:19,166
You please find some solution.

1180
01:20:23,791 --> 01:20:24,833
Sir the..

1181
01:20:31,750 --> 01:20:33,083
Your father was a great man.

1182
01:20:34,208 --> 01:20:37,500
- He used to prove his words.
- Yes.

1183
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:39,791
Modi has a problem with you.

1184
01:20:40,583 --> 01:20:42,303
But now that problem
is taking toll from us.

1185
01:20:42,333 --> 01:20:43,666
Give me little more time.

1186
01:20:44,041 --> 01:20:45,041
One week.

1187
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:48,541
After that, you're out.

1188
01:20:59,625 --> 01:21:00,375
Yes, sir.

1189
01:21:00,458 --> 01:21:02,750
Kunal, do whatever you have to do.

1190
01:21:03,791 --> 01:21:05,333
Use as many cash as you want.

1191
01:21:06,375 --> 01:21:09,708
But that file must
clear in just one week.

1192
01:21:09,833 --> 01:21:10,833
Do you understand?

1193
01:21:10,875 --> 01:21:12,115
I will meet the minister today.

1194
01:21:12,875 --> 01:21:13,708
Minister.

1195
01:21:13,833 --> 01:21:16,000
Do my job in this week only.

1196
01:21:16,083 --> 01:21:17,583
Yes, it will be done. Don't worry.

1197
01:21:17,666 --> 01:21:18,666
And Modi?

1198
01:21:18,708 --> 01:21:22,000
This is my department.
Modi will not even get a hint.

1199
01:21:22,625 --> 01:21:26,250
By the way, I hope it's full 5 lakh.

1200
01:21:26,375 --> 01:21:30,375
- Yes, sir.
- You see, 5 is my lucky number.

1201
01:21:31,666 --> 01:21:32,666
Shake hands.

1202
01:21:33,166 --> 01:21:37,083
"Beat the drums,
I want to dance on it's tunes."

1203
01:21:37,250 --> 01:21:38,125
"Drummer.."

1204
01:21:38,208 --> 01:21:39,833
"Drummer.."

1205
01:21:42,791 --> 01:21:43,791
- Hey.
- Yes.

1206
01:21:44,250 --> 01:21:46,041
Why did you stop in
the middle of the road?

1207
01:21:46,125 --> 01:21:47,125
Have you gone mad?

1208
01:21:47,708 --> 01:21:48,750
Sir, call for you.

1209
01:21:49,916 --> 01:21:50,916
For me?

1210
01:21:51,208 --> 01:21:52,000
Who's it?

1211
01:21:52,083 --> 01:21:53,083
CM sir.

1212
01:21:56,375 --> 01:21:59,583
Reach my office. I want to talk.

1213
01:22:01,666 --> 01:22:02,916
Will reach in an hour.

1214
01:22:03,166 --> 01:22:04,166
Why one hour?

1215
01:22:05,375 --> 01:22:07,875
You just left from Redfox hotel.

1216
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,750
It's just five minutes
away from my office.

1217
01:22:12,541 --> 01:22:13,541
And yes.

1218
01:22:14,250 --> 01:22:16,166
Also bring that bag along with you.

1219
01:22:17,583 --> 01:22:19,083
The one you took it in the hotel.

1220
01:22:20,541 --> 01:22:21,833
Yes. Yes, okay.

1221
01:22:27,208 --> 01:22:28,208
I was..

1222
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:31,375
I was collecting
it for the party fund.

1223
01:22:31,541 --> 01:22:32,541
Really?

1224
01:22:33,666 --> 01:22:34,976
But he has something else to say.

1225
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,958
Sir, I..
I am a businessman, sir. And I..

1226
01:22:39,833 --> 01:22:41,958
I don't want to see
you in my Gujarat again.

1227
01:22:42,833 --> 01:22:44,273
Or else I will send you behind bars.

1228
01:22:50,208 --> 01:22:51,500
You should be ashamed.

1229
01:22:52,666 --> 01:22:54,458
Such a long political career.

1230
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:57,416
Your name, family's prestige.

1231
01:22:58,291 --> 01:22:59,500
Is this how you value them?

1232
01:23:01,875 --> 01:23:02,875
One..

1233
01:23:03,625 --> 01:23:05,583
Just give me one chance.

1234
01:23:06,750 --> 01:23:08,875
First and last chance.

1235
01:23:09,958 --> 01:23:10,958
Pick up the bag.

1236
01:23:11,375 --> 01:23:12,375
No.

1237
01:23:12,541 --> 01:23:13,750
Pick up the bag.

1238
01:23:16,541 --> 01:23:19,458
Distribute this cash amongst
the families of martyred..

1239
01:23:20,375 --> 01:23:22,125
..hailed from Guajrat.

1240
01:23:22,541 --> 01:23:23,958
On behalf of the state.

1241
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:27,916
I want to see the receipt.

1242
01:23:29,208 --> 01:23:30,208
Ramji.

1243
01:23:34,541 --> 01:23:35,916
Neither will I accept any bribe..

1244
01:23:36,333 --> 01:23:37,693
..nor will I let others accept it.

1245
01:23:40,333 --> 01:23:41,916
What are you doing?

1246
01:23:42,125 --> 01:23:43,416
It's just 7 AM.

1247
01:23:43,541 --> 01:23:45,916
Rather, it's 5:30 AM.

1248
01:23:46,166 --> 01:23:46,916
I've to reach office.

1249
01:23:47,041 --> 01:23:48,125
So early?

1250
01:23:48,916 --> 01:23:49,708
Are you mad?

1251
01:23:49,791 --> 01:23:50,958
Yes, I am.

1252
01:23:51,041 --> 01:23:52,958
Modi has turned me mad.

1253
01:23:53,041 --> 01:23:55,041
He neither accepts bribe,
nor does he allow others.

1254
01:23:55,125 --> 01:23:57,416
Similarly, he doesn't even
allow us to sleep at night.

1255
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:09,083
- Chairs.
- Not available, sir.

1256
01:24:09,166 --> 01:24:10,166
Not available?

1257
01:24:11,958 --> 01:24:15,416
People elected us. Not to sit idle.

1258
01:24:15,958 --> 01:24:17,791
But to get back to work.

1259
01:24:18,250 --> 01:24:21,083
Be a CM, for the CM.

1260
01:24:21,916 --> 01:24:22,958
Common man.

1261
01:24:29,541 --> 01:24:31,041
Gujarat Development Model.

1262
01:24:31,916 --> 01:24:33,583
Running a government is..

1263
01:24:33,916 --> 01:24:35,541
..nothing different than making tea.

1264
01:24:36,541 --> 01:24:38,916
Take little water.
Add tea powder to it.

1265
01:24:41,041 --> 01:24:42,321
Allow it to boil on a low flame.

1266
01:24:42,416 --> 01:24:43,416
Never, be in a hurry.

1267
01:24:43,541 --> 01:24:45,333
It can spoil your efforts.

1268
01:24:45,416 --> 01:24:46,541
Add little milk now.

1269
01:24:46,791 --> 01:24:47,958
Don't add too much.

1270
01:24:48,541 --> 01:24:50,041
Or else you will feel bloated.

1271
01:24:51,166 --> 01:24:55,041
Make sure your work
is noticed not your belly.

1272
01:24:56,333 --> 01:24:58,583
Add sugar. Very little.

1273
01:24:59,083 --> 01:25:00,791
I will not have
anything sweet in taste.

1274
01:25:00,958 --> 01:25:02,541
Nor will I let others have it.

1275
01:25:03,833 --> 01:25:04,916
Ginger.

1276
01:25:05,791 --> 01:25:07,333
Keeps your brain fit.

1277
01:25:07,666 --> 01:25:09,791
I just can't tolerate laziness.

1278
01:25:11,041 --> 01:25:11,916
Cardamom.

1279
01:25:12,041 --> 01:25:13,666
Helps fight indigestion.

1280
01:25:13,916 --> 01:25:14,958
No upset stomach.

1281
01:25:16,041 --> 01:25:17,458
No wicked intentions.

1282
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:20,416
Now, stir slowly with a ladle.

1283
01:25:20,666 --> 01:25:21,833
Without making noise.

1284
01:25:22,791 --> 01:25:25,791
Your output should
be more, not noisy.

1285
01:25:26,166 --> 01:25:28,916
There you go.
Modi special tea is ready.

1286
01:25:31,833 --> 01:25:32,833
Will you eat?

1287
01:25:33,291 --> 01:25:34,083
No.

1288
01:25:34,291 --> 01:25:36,541
- Take it.
- I'm fasting, starting today.

1289
01:25:40,541 --> 01:25:41,708
- Ramji.
- Yes.

1290
01:25:41,791 --> 01:25:42,791
Come.

1291
01:25:43,666 --> 01:25:44,666
Please, start.

1292
01:25:46,916 --> 01:25:47,916
What are you doing?

1293
01:25:48,458 --> 01:25:51,666
You're elected to
serve and not to enjoy.

1294
01:25:52,166 --> 01:25:53,166
Sureshbhai.

1295
01:25:53,666 --> 01:25:54,666
Start.

1296
01:25:54,791 --> 01:25:55,791
Serving them.

1297
01:25:57,208 --> 01:25:58,208
Take it.

1298
01:25:59,291 --> 01:26:00,541
All of you, please come in.

1299
01:26:04,291 --> 01:26:05,291
Sir.

1300
01:26:06,416 --> 01:26:08,166
In 36 years of my service..

1301
01:26:10,291 --> 01:26:13,291
..I've never received such respect.

1302
01:26:14,416 --> 01:26:15,958
Get used to it.

1303
01:26:16,833 --> 01:26:18,541
Because this is New Gujarat.

1304
01:26:21,416 --> 01:26:23,875
"A word 'Namo'
will echo in the country."

1305
01:26:23,916 --> 01:26:26,458
"No one will be in race with 'Namo'."

1306
01:26:26,666 --> 01:26:28,916
"Form the day one,
he had a vision to reform India."

1307
01:26:28,958 --> 01:26:31,583
"He's always energetic
and inspiring."

1308
01:26:31,666 --> 01:26:33,916
"He will evoke nationalism
in the citizens."

1309
01:26:34,041 --> 01:26:36,416
"And prove India's skills."

1310
01:26:39,416 --> 01:26:41,541
"The wounds are fresh."

1311
01:26:41,583 --> 01:26:44,083
"Live a little."

1312
01:26:44,166 --> 01:26:47,416
"Why shed tears?"

1313
01:26:48,583 --> 01:26:51,458
As per your instructions,
your meeting is fixed..

1314
01:26:51,666 --> 01:26:53,333
..with all the top
companies of America..

1315
01:26:53,416 --> 01:26:55,166
..and NRI organizations.

1316
01:26:55,958 --> 01:26:58,916
Sir, what's your investment
target for Gujarat?

1317
01:27:00,416 --> 01:27:02,208
45,000 crores.

1318
01:27:02,416 --> 01:27:05,916
Sir, that's too big.
I think it's impossible.

1319
01:27:06,041 --> 01:27:07,791
We will have to make it possible.

1320
01:27:08,291 --> 01:27:10,291
Every year after graduation,
youth of Gujarat..

1321
01:27:10,333 --> 01:27:12,208
..receives nothing
but the disappointment.

1322
01:27:12,708 --> 01:27:13,791
There's no employment.

1323
01:27:14,166 --> 01:27:16,458
Investment will boost
the infrastructure sector..

1324
01:27:16,541 --> 01:27:19,291
..which in turn will
generate employment.

1325
01:27:19,791 --> 01:27:23,541
I will personally meet
the major CEO of America..

1326
01:27:23,708 --> 01:27:26,333
..and request them to come to Gujarat.

1327
01:27:28,791 --> 01:27:29,833
Yes, Joshi.

1328
01:27:30,333 --> 01:27:31,541
Sir.

1329
01:27:32,166 --> 01:27:33,416
Go ahead, Joshi.

1330
01:27:36,583 --> 01:27:38,041
Sir, everyone's visas are received.

1331
01:27:38,416 --> 01:27:39,416
Good.

1332
01:27:40,541 --> 01:27:42,958
But one person's visa is cancelled.

1333
01:27:43,666 --> 01:27:44,666
And who's he?

1334
01:27:46,666 --> 01:27:47,666
You.

1335
01:27:48,291 --> 01:27:50,541
I'm sure central government
is behind this.

1336
01:27:53,791 --> 01:27:57,291
Also, media got the news before us.

1337
01:27:58,041 --> 01:27:59,416
Without you..

1338
01:27:59,791 --> 01:28:01,871
..we will not be able to
pull investments in Gujarat.

1339
01:28:04,041 --> 01:28:06,916
There's no point in going
to America without you.

1340
01:28:07,291 --> 01:28:10,416
- I think.. should we cancel the trip?
- No.

1341
01:28:11,333 --> 01:28:12,958
Whether I get the visa or not..

1342
01:28:14,666 --> 01:28:17,333
..I will definitely reach America.

1343
01:28:17,666 --> 01:28:19,083
Just as you asked, Mr. Reddy.

1344
01:28:19,583 --> 01:28:21,291
We denied Modi's Visa.

1345
01:28:21,458 --> 01:28:25,208
So then why all these organizers booking
halls and stadiums all across the US?

1346
01:28:26,791 --> 01:28:27,791
We are not certain.

1347
01:28:28,208 --> 01:28:30,416
But one thing we are certain of.

1348
01:28:30,583 --> 01:28:33,041
Mr. Modi will never set for America.

1349
01:28:34,916 --> 01:28:36,791
You kicked me out of Gujarat, Modi.

1350
01:28:39,541 --> 01:28:41,416
I will not let you
step out of Gujarat.

1351
01:28:43,416 --> 01:28:44,916
Modi! Modi!

1352
01:28:45,208 --> 01:28:46,666
Modi! Modi!

1353
01:28:46,916 --> 01:28:48,541
Modi! Modi!

1354
01:28:48,791 --> 01:28:49,666
Modi! Modi!

1355
01:28:49,791 --> 01:28:50,791
Jai Hind!

1356
01:28:57,208 --> 01:28:59,791
Indian may settle
anywhere in the world.

1357
01:29:01,208 --> 01:29:03,291
But we live in each other's heart.

1358
01:29:07,541 --> 01:29:12,041
I don't need any
visa to reach you all.

1359
01:29:16,416 --> 01:29:20,041
I'm really happy
watching your progress.

1360
01:29:20,666 --> 01:29:21,666
I feel proud.

1361
01:29:22,166 --> 01:29:26,916
Our NRI. And NRG of our Gujarat.

1362
01:29:27,208 --> 01:29:30,166
Now, you must be the
energy of New Gujarat.

1363
01:29:30,333 --> 01:29:31,458
And yes.

1364
01:29:32,083 --> 01:29:33,291
I promise.

1365
01:29:34,416 --> 01:29:37,416
I will welcome you with red carpet.

1366
01:29:37,666 --> 01:29:39,166
Not with red tape.

1367
01:29:40,083 --> 01:29:43,291
With co-operation,
not with corruption.

1368
01:29:43,916 --> 01:29:45,916
I request you all.

1369
01:29:46,708 --> 01:29:49,333
Do come to Gujarat Vibrant Summit.

1370
01:29:50,791 --> 01:29:51,833
Get connected.

1371
01:29:52,541 --> 01:29:53,541
Form a chain.

1372
01:29:54,416 --> 01:29:58,791
Together we've to make a new Gujarat,
New India.

1373
01:29:58,916 --> 01:30:00,416
Modi! Modi!

1374
01:30:00,666 --> 01:30:02,333
Modi! Modi!

1375
01:30:03,041 --> 01:30:05,041
You may be living in
any country of the world.

1376
01:30:06,458 --> 01:30:08,208
But this is your country.

1377
01:30:09,583 --> 01:30:10,666
Hindustan.

1378
01:30:11,666 --> 01:30:13,041
Modi! Modi!

1379
01:30:13,083 --> 01:30:14,791
Modi! Modi!

1380
01:30:14,916 --> 01:30:16,083
How many did they say?

1381
01:30:16,916 --> 01:30:18,833
Two hundred seventy thousand..

1382
01:30:18,916 --> 01:30:20,333
..Indians across 14 states?

1383
01:30:21,791 --> 01:30:23,291
Man, this guy is popular.

1384
01:30:25,916 --> 01:30:28,041
Hope I didn't make the
mistake denying him a visa.

1385
01:30:28,416 --> 01:30:29,416
- Joshi.
- Yes.

1386
01:30:29,666 --> 01:30:31,166
How's the response for the summit?

1387
01:30:31,291 --> 01:30:32,666
Response is just amazing, sir.

1388
01:30:33,041 --> 01:30:34,666
NRI investors have queued up.

1389
01:30:35,666 --> 01:30:38,291
But sir, after your video conference..

1390
01:30:38,333 --> 01:30:40,291
..with all the major
America companies' CEO.

1391
01:30:40,333 --> 01:30:40,791
Yes.

1392
01:30:40,916 --> 01:30:41,916
I've taken a follow up.

1393
01:30:42,041 --> 01:30:42,666
Yes, so?

1394
01:30:42,791 --> 01:30:44,351
But not a single
positive response, sir.

1395
01:30:54,166 --> 01:30:56,291
Their confidence
will build in Gujarat..

1396
01:30:58,166 --> 01:31:00,791
..only after the top Indian
company invests here.

1397
01:31:01,791 --> 01:31:02,708
And who will invest?

1398
01:31:02,791 --> 01:31:04,684
'Tata workers are still
fearful and intimidated..'

1399
01:31:04,708 --> 01:31:06,291
'..which has forced Ratan Tata..'

1400
01:31:06,333 --> 01:31:07,733
'..to take that crucial decision..'

1401
01:31:07,791 --> 01:31:09,833
'..of suspending work at the Singur..'

1402
01:31:09,916 --> 01:31:13,708
'..plant for the NANO project.'

1403
01:31:13,833 --> 01:31:18,041
We need to invest something
to bring the investment.

1404
01:31:19,333 --> 01:31:20,333
What's that, sir?

1405
01:31:21,708 --> 01:31:22,708
One rupee.

1406
01:31:24,541 --> 01:31:27,166
You mean CM himself
sent you a message?

1407
01:31:28,041 --> 01:31:29,041
Personal message?

1408
01:31:29,833 --> 01:31:30,666
Yes.

1409
01:31:30,708 --> 01:31:33,291
Normally,
these politicians make us go around..

1410
01:31:33,458 --> 01:31:34,291
..their secretaries and officers.

1411
01:31:34,416 --> 01:31:35,958
Yes, but this Modi is different.

1412
01:31:37,416 --> 01:31:39,166
I was watching his
TV interview yesterday.

1413
01:31:39,291 --> 01:31:40,833
And he said something
very interesting.

1414
01:31:41,666 --> 01:31:45,708
He said, government has
no business to be in business.

1415
01:31:46,541 --> 01:31:47,458
Seems progressive.

1416
01:31:47,541 --> 01:31:49,083
Seems pro-active. Don't you think so?

1417
01:31:49,208 --> 01:31:52,916
Sir, he may be different
but system is same in India.

1418
01:31:53,208 --> 01:31:54,125
Slow and corrupt.

1419
01:31:54,166 --> 01:31:57,041
We will stuck up between
permission and procedure.

1420
01:31:57,458 --> 01:31:59,291
One should never do business in India.

1421
01:31:59,791 --> 01:32:00,958
Let's move abroad.

1422
01:32:02,041 --> 01:32:04,041
Gupta, let me make
one thing very clear.

1423
01:32:04,458 --> 01:32:06,291
TATA hasn't made India.

1424
01:32:07,708 --> 01:32:09,416
India has made TATA.

1425
01:32:09,916 --> 01:32:12,791
Sorry, sir. but I think
this trip is a waste of time.

1426
01:32:12,916 --> 01:32:15,083
His one word said everything.

1427
01:32:17,041 --> 01:32:19,166
And I'd like to listen to him.

1428
01:32:23,291 --> 01:32:24,333
Welcome.

1429
01:32:29,666 --> 01:32:31,184
- Welcome to Gujarat, sir.
- Thank you.

1430
01:32:31,208 --> 01:32:32,416
Modiji is waiting for you.

1431
01:32:32,833 --> 01:32:34,583
So, are we directly
going to the CM office?

1432
01:32:35,416 --> 01:32:36,416
No.

1433
01:32:38,208 --> 01:32:39,208
Okay.

1434
01:32:40,083 --> 01:32:41,083
Quite strange.

1435
01:32:41,541 --> 01:32:42,981
Why did he arrange our meeting here?

1436
01:32:43,166 --> 01:32:44,708
He's the CM of the state.

1437
01:32:44,916 --> 01:32:46,833
He can arrange meeting
anywhere he wishes to.

1438
01:32:47,416 --> 01:32:48,416
Hello, Modiji.

1439
01:32:48,958 --> 01:32:49,958
Jai Hind!

1440
01:32:51,666 --> 01:32:53,333
Let's directly come to the point.

1441
01:32:53,833 --> 01:32:55,333
Your time is precious.

1442
01:32:56,916 --> 01:32:57,916
So is yours.

1443
01:33:00,333 --> 01:33:03,083
He's Gupta. The project head.

1444
01:33:03,291 --> 01:33:04,333
Gupta, go ahead.

1445
01:33:04,416 --> 01:33:06,666
Sir. Honestly this
project is very big.

1446
01:33:06,916 --> 01:33:09,791
And we want at least 500
acres of land at one place.

1447
01:33:10,166 --> 01:33:13,041
As you know land acquisition
is a big issue in India.

1448
01:33:13,166 --> 01:33:15,486
How much time it will take
for us to get 500 acres of land?

1449
01:33:15,958 --> 01:33:16,958
One second.

1450
01:33:17,916 --> 01:33:18,666
Meaning?

1451
01:33:18,833 --> 01:33:20,416
You're standing on
that plot right now.

1452
01:33:21,583 --> 01:33:25,291
But yes, it's not 500 acres.
It's 11000 acres altogether.

1453
01:33:27,541 --> 01:33:31,666
Because I always
think about the maximum.

1454
01:33:32,541 --> 01:33:33,541
That's great.

1455
01:33:33,791 --> 01:33:35,541
But we've to complete 28 compliances.

1456
01:33:35,583 --> 01:33:37,017
Based on my experience, to complete..

1457
01:33:37,041 --> 01:33:39,416
..all these permissions
and procedures..

1458
01:33:39,541 --> 01:33:41,309
- ..it will take about 8 months..
- Mr. Gupta,

1459
01:33:41,333 --> 01:33:42,333
What do you do?

1460
01:33:42,416 --> 01:33:43,166
I'm a project head.

1461
01:33:43,208 --> 01:33:45,291
No, what do you do?

1462
01:33:45,708 --> 01:33:46,708
TATA motors!

1463
01:33:46,916 --> 01:33:47,916
We make cars.

1464
01:33:48,083 --> 01:33:49,666
So you do your job.

1465
01:33:50,041 --> 01:33:51,916
Let the government do his.

1466
01:33:52,916 --> 01:33:53,541
Joshi.

1467
01:33:53,916 --> 01:33:54,916
File.

1468
01:33:56,916 --> 01:33:59,041
Not just 28, these are 29 permissions.

1469
01:33:59,375 --> 01:34:00,666
All of them are complete.

1470
01:34:01,583 --> 01:34:03,666
You can start your work from tomorrow.

1471
01:34:03,833 --> 01:34:05,833
Modiji, why did you
invite me to Gujarat?

1472
01:34:06,458 --> 01:34:08,041
For the 20000 families.

1473
01:34:09,041 --> 01:34:10,041
Employment.

1474
01:34:11,541 --> 01:34:13,541
Empowerment through employment.

1475
01:34:14,583 --> 01:34:17,083
If you come here,
I will make this region..

1476
01:34:17,166 --> 01:34:19,666
..the number one
automobile hub of India.

1477
01:34:20,916 --> 01:34:24,291
From 20,000 to 20 lakh employment.

1478
01:34:25,208 --> 01:34:26,208
That's my target.

1479
01:34:27,416 --> 01:34:29,333
I must say I am impressed, Modiji.

1480
01:34:29,833 --> 01:34:31,916
But I need some time to think.

1481
01:34:34,083 --> 01:34:40,833
Decision not taken in
a minute is never a decision.

1482
01:34:43,041 --> 01:34:45,208
15 seconds are still to go.

1483
01:34:46,833 --> 01:34:50,916
Mr. Modi,
we came with little expectations.

1484
01:34:52,291 --> 01:34:54,041
But you gave us everything
ready in a plate.

1485
01:34:56,416 --> 01:34:57,416
Thank you.

1486
01:34:57,916 --> 01:34:59,041
You were right, sir.

1487
01:35:00,458 --> 01:35:01,791
Not just the American companies..

1488
01:35:01,833 --> 01:35:03,267
..but the top companies
across the world..

1489
01:35:03,291 --> 01:35:05,011
..have queued up after
TATA came to Gujarat.

1490
01:35:05,291 --> 01:35:06,833
You've set a world record, sir.

1491
01:35:07,666 --> 01:35:08,666
And how is that?

1492
01:35:08,916 --> 01:35:11,208
Just one rupee's investment
on a text message.

1493
01:35:11,291 --> 01:35:14,833
And it pulled 75000
crores for Gujarat.

1494
01:35:33,291 --> 01:35:35,041
The world is one family.

1495
01:35:35,583 --> 01:35:38,041
Welcome to Gujarat.

1496
01:35:38,416 --> 01:35:41,166
Welcome to the vibrant Gujarat Summit.

1497
01:35:51,708 --> 01:35:55,083
We are native of Gujarat
and have come back to Gujarat.

1498
01:35:59,791 --> 01:36:03,416
Jamshedji Tata was born in Navsari.

1499
01:36:03,708 --> 01:36:07,166
And he had set up our
company from this very land.

1500
01:36:07,416 --> 01:36:10,833
I'm happy returning home.

1501
01:36:11,166 --> 01:36:13,291
And I want to thank you,
Modji for everything.

1502
01:36:19,666 --> 01:36:22,291
I also admire your positive attitude.

1503
01:36:22,833 --> 01:36:25,166
You didn't get American visa.

1504
01:36:25,416 --> 01:36:28,791
But in response, you brought
the entire world to Gujarat.

1505
01:36:34,166 --> 01:36:36,666
This isn't just the beginning for us..

1506
01:36:37,791 --> 01:36:39,833
..but for the New Gujarat.

1507
01:36:40,541 --> 01:36:41,458
Thank you, Modi.

1508
01:36:41,541 --> 01:36:42,708
Thank you very much.

1509
01:36:42,791 --> 01:36:43,833
Thank you.

1510
01:36:47,541 --> 01:36:49,166
Big success, huh!

1511
01:36:50,166 --> 01:36:51,166
Yes.

1512
01:36:52,291 --> 01:36:53,833
Every major American companies..

1513
01:36:53,916 --> 01:36:55,791
..and thousands of Americans are here.

1514
01:36:56,333 --> 01:36:57,708
To do business in Gujarat.

1515
01:36:58,291 --> 01:36:59,708
It's just the beginning.

1516
01:37:01,291 --> 01:37:02,583
Did you speak with him?

1517
01:37:02,833 --> 01:37:04,583
Can we meet after the summit?

1518
01:37:06,416 --> 01:37:07,416
No.

1519
01:37:08,083 --> 01:37:09,416
You're meeting him now.

1520
01:37:09,791 --> 01:37:10,791
Now?

1521
01:37:12,166 --> 01:37:13,166
On stage.

1522
01:37:17,541 --> 01:37:19,208
Congratulations, Mr. Modi.

1523
01:37:21,541 --> 01:37:23,916
This is truly a world class event.

1524
01:37:24,166 --> 01:37:25,208
Thank you.

1525
01:37:25,541 --> 01:37:28,166
I hope he didn't face
any problem getting the visa.

1526
01:37:28,333 --> 01:37:29,166
I am sorry.

1527
01:37:29,291 --> 01:37:31,791
I hope you had no
trouble getting the visa.

1528
01:37:33,583 --> 01:37:34,583
Smile.

1529
01:37:39,666 --> 01:37:43,791
As you can see, Narendra
Modi has won election with majority.

1530
01:37:43,833 --> 01:37:46,083
And has become the CM
of Gujarat for the fourth time.

1531
01:37:46,166 --> 01:37:49,291
Wait and watch for
his next action now.

1532
01:37:50,041 --> 01:37:51,291
Bless me, mom.

1533
01:37:51,333 --> 01:37:52,541
Bless you.

1534
01:37:55,416 --> 01:37:57,333
- Are you hungry?
- A lot.

1535
01:37:57,916 --> 01:37:59,583
This is nothing.

1536
01:37:59,666 --> 01:38:04,541
Once he had brought
home a baby crocodile.

1537
01:38:04,666 --> 01:38:06,291
- Really uncle?
- Yes.

1538
01:38:06,416 --> 01:38:07,916
- Crocodile?
- Yes.

1539
01:38:08,083 --> 01:38:10,833
Yes, and when I refused
to keep it at home..

1540
01:38:10,916 --> 01:38:12,791
..he took it to the school.

1541
01:38:12,833 --> 01:38:14,541
School? What happened after that?

1542
01:38:14,666 --> 01:38:17,458
Students as well as teachers
ran away from the school.

1543
01:38:18,166 --> 01:38:21,916
- That means no studies.
- Yes.

1544
01:38:22,833 --> 01:38:24,916
I still play with the crocodiles.

1545
01:38:24,958 --> 01:38:26,541
- What?
- Yes.

1546
01:38:26,833 --> 01:38:28,166
In politics.

1547
01:38:29,041 --> 01:38:30,541
That's true.

1548
01:38:35,791 --> 01:38:40,291
Gujarat's chief minister
is doing dishes in my kitchen?

1549
01:38:40,541 --> 01:38:42,166
I like to serve you like this.

1550
01:38:43,333 --> 01:38:44,666
You're mad.

1551
01:38:48,666 --> 01:38:50,416
- Give it to me.
- Here you are.

1552
01:38:57,916 --> 01:38:58,916
Mom.

1553
01:39:00,208 --> 01:39:01,416
Are you alright?

1554
01:39:02,416 --> 01:39:03,958
Don't worry about me.

1555
01:39:05,833 --> 01:39:07,041
I am fine.

1556
01:39:28,208 --> 01:39:30,416
What are you thinking about?

1557
01:39:32,833 --> 01:39:36,583
Party wants me to go to Delhi.

1558
01:39:37,791 --> 01:39:39,791
As PM candidate.

1559
01:39:44,416 --> 01:39:48,583
But mom, Delhi and
the politics over there..

1560
01:39:48,958 --> 01:39:50,416
..won't suit me.

1561
01:39:51,041 --> 01:39:52,458
I won't be able to fit there.

1562
01:39:52,791 --> 01:39:55,166
And there are many things
pending in Gujarat.

1563
01:39:57,041 --> 01:39:58,541
I think I will refuse.

1564
01:40:06,833 --> 01:40:11,791
You provided 24 hour
electricity in Gujarat.

1565
01:40:12,791 --> 01:40:16,458
Otherwise,
we were used to living in dark.

1566
01:40:18,958 --> 01:40:19,958
Son.

1567
01:40:22,333 --> 01:40:24,291
Country is covered with darkness.

1568
01:40:26,166 --> 01:40:28,541
People need some light.

1569
01:40:32,583 --> 01:40:33,583
You go.

1570
01:40:34,041 --> 01:40:35,708
You go to Delhi.

1571
01:40:40,166 --> 01:40:42,666
How did we lose on
these seats in Gujarat?

1572
01:40:43,416 --> 01:40:45,666
They were minorities dominated seats.

1573
01:40:45,833 --> 01:40:46,916
Yes, ma'am.

1574
01:40:47,916 --> 01:40:50,541
Now, even your ancestral
vote bank has joined him.

1575
01:40:50,708 --> 01:40:52,958
How's he doing it? I am confused.

1576
01:40:53,166 --> 01:40:54,541
Simple.

1577
01:40:55,416 --> 01:40:58,041
Modi has changed the
political formula of the game.

1578
01:40:58,291 --> 01:41:01,458
From divide and rule
to unite and rule.

1579
01:41:01,708 --> 01:41:04,541
I heard that now BJP is
planning to send him to Delhi.

1580
01:41:04,791 --> 01:41:05,791
To the parliament?

1581
01:41:07,041 --> 01:41:08,458
But we will not let this happen.

1582
01:41:08,666 --> 01:41:10,166
Do we have an option?

1583
01:41:11,541 --> 01:41:14,541
That Godhara case...

1584
01:41:15,083 --> 01:41:16,291
What's the name of that judge?

1585
01:41:16,541 --> 01:41:18,291
Modiji, please reply.

1586
01:41:18,541 --> 01:41:19,541
Modiji.

1587
01:41:19,583 --> 01:41:20,541
- Please reply.
- Modiji.

1588
01:41:20,583 --> 01:41:23,791
You're alleged
for communal riots in Godhra.

1589
01:41:24,083 --> 01:41:25,416
What will you say on this?

1590
01:41:28,583 --> 01:41:29,833
Truth always triumphs.

1591
01:41:57,333 --> 01:42:00,291
SIT interrogation
last for about 9 hours.

1592
01:42:00,541 --> 01:42:04,166
After 11 years of Godhra incidence,
it will be decided by SIT..

1593
01:42:04,291 --> 01:42:08,416
..if Narendra Modi was responsible
for Godhra incidence or not.

1594
01:42:08,791 --> 01:42:10,541
Good work on the SIT.

1595
01:42:10,958 --> 01:42:12,666
- Keep it up.
- Thank you, sir.

1596
01:42:12,916 --> 01:42:14,583
Now make such a move..

1597
01:42:14,916 --> 01:42:16,958
..that before SIT's judgment..

1598
01:42:17,791 --> 01:42:19,666
..public opinion would go against him.

1599
01:42:19,916 --> 01:42:22,666
Narendra deals with lives.

1600
01:42:23,041 --> 01:42:23,958
Yes.

1601
01:42:24,041 --> 01:42:27,708
He said that he still yields poison.

1602
01:42:27,958 --> 01:42:28,833
Other leaders..

1603
01:42:28,916 --> 01:42:30,309
- Man behind Godhra massacre.
- ..call him as Hitler.

1604
01:42:30,333 --> 01:42:31,833
Butcher of Godhra.

1605
01:42:32,041 --> 01:42:33,291
Lies after lies.

1606
01:42:33,333 --> 01:42:34,541
Series of lies.

1607
01:42:34,666 --> 01:42:36,833
How do we face these lies?

1608
01:42:37,916 --> 01:42:39,416
We will speak the truth.

1609
01:42:40,416 --> 01:42:41,958
- Joshi.
- Yes.

1610
01:42:42,166 --> 01:42:43,583
Call up Hemraj.

1611
01:42:44,291 --> 01:42:46,041
What?

1612
01:42:47,583 --> 01:42:48,166
Hello.

1613
01:42:48,208 --> 01:42:50,083
Modiji wants to give an interview.

1614
01:42:50,166 --> 01:42:50,958
When?

1615
01:42:51,041 --> 01:42:51,708
Today.

1616
01:42:51,791 --> 01:42:53,083
I will be there.

1617
01:42:53,166 --> 01:42:54,583
But on a condition.

1618
01:42:54,666 --> 01:42:57,708
- What?
- Interview will be live.

1619
01:42:57,791 --> 01:42:59,041
Live?

1620
01:43:00,208 --> 01:43:02,416
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

1621
01:43:03,333 --> 01:43:05,416
I was waiting for this opportunity.

1622
01:43:06,333 --> 01:43:07,958
Let's finish him.

1623
01:43:12,791 --> 01:43:15,333
SIT result can be
announced any moment.

1624
01:43:15,458 --> 01:43:17,166
And he's going to give interview.

1625
01:43:17,291 --> 01:43:18,291
That too, live.

1626
01:43:18,333 --> 01:43:20,458
Sir, you know him better than me.

1627
01:43:20,791 --> 01:43:24,333
If he decides once,
no one can stop him.

1628
01:43:24,833 --> 01:43:27,083
I will call you up as soon
as SIT result is out.

1629
01:43:27,333 --> 01:43:28,791
Tonight's Exclusive..

1630
01:43:29,416 --> 01:43:31,666
All of you will watch.

1631
01:43:32,041 --> 01:43:34,041
The end of Narendra Modi.

1632
01:43:38,083 --> 01:43:41,291
I will not beat around the bush.

1633
01:43:41,375 --> 01:43:42,708
So, let me ask you directly.

1634
01:43:42,791 --> 01:43:45,791
Why haven't you apologized
for Godhra incidence till date?

1635
01:43:46,375 --> 01:43:47,916
Bouncer on the very first ball.

1636
01:43:48,083 --> 01:43:49,375
Good one.

1637
01:43:50,041 --> 01:43:52,000
Only the criminals apologise.

1638
01:43:52,083 --> 01:43:53,875
And the law demands evidences.

1639
01:43:53,958 --> 01:43:57,541
If I've committed any crime,
then give me death penalty.

1640
01:43:58,166 --> 01:43:59,166
I accept.

1641
01:43:59,250 --> 01:44:00,583
If you're innocent..

1642
01:44:00,666 --> 01:44:03,746
..then how come your government were
mute spectacles when Gujarat was on fire?

1643
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:07,833
Nanavati Commission
Reports clearly stated..

1644
01:44:08,458 --> 01:44:11,000
..it's neither mine
nor my Government's fault.

1645
01:44:11,541 --> 01:44:16,291
It is also mentioned
in the report that..

1646
01:44:17,208 --> 01:44:20,750
..setting afire 59 people
in Sabarmati Express..

1647
01:44:21,666 --> 01:44:25,916
..was not an accident
but a well thought plan.

1648
01:44:26,541 --> 01:44:29,333
But your channel
never aired this news.

1649
01:44:29,708 --> 01:44:32,875
Mr. Hemraj,
don't show fake arguments..

1650
01:44:33,125 --> 01:44:35,708
..and sell your news.

1651
01:44:36,583 --> 01:44:38,625
Public knows everything.

1652
01:44:40,250 --> 01:44:42,208
12 years passed.

1653
01:44:42,291 --> 01:44:43,666
12 years.

1654
01:44:44,583 --> 01:44:46,000
What's curfew?

1655
01:44:46,458 --> 01:44:47,708
What's riot?

1656
01:44:48,416 --> 01:44:51,416
None of the child in
Gujarat knows about it.

1657
01:44:51,500 --> 01:44:53,642
Who are the real culprits behind communal
riots after Godhra incidence.

1658
01:44:53,666 --> 01:44:55,750
Hindu or Muslim?

1659
01:44:57,958 --> 01:44:59,875
- Muslim.
- What did you say?

1660
01:45:00,125 --> 01:45:01,916
This is what you want
to hear from me, right?

1661
01:45:03,541 --> 01:45:05,708
For Muslims, Hindus are the culprit.

1662
01:45:06,166 --> 01:45:08,208
And for Hindus,
Muslims are the culprit.

1663
01:45:08,708 --> 01:45:11,708
But in my views,
both the communities..

1664
01:45:11,791 --> 01:45:13,875
..are culprit in terms of humanity.

1665
01:45:14,333 --> 01:45:16,833
Violence has no religion.

1666
01:45:17,666 --> 01:45:20,250
And no religion has violence.

1667
01:45:20,791 --> 01:45:22,500
Gujarat CM is with whom?

1668
01:45:23,750 --> 01:45:27,375
With poor or with businessmen?

1669
01:45:28,500 --> 01:45:29,833
With the progress.

1670
01:45:29,916 --> 01:45:34,708
World has praised Gujarat
Development Model.

1671
01:45:35,166 --> 01:45:36,791
But congress believes that your..

1672
01:45:37,291 --> 01:45:41,291
..Gujarat Development model is fake.

1673
01:45:41,750 --> 01:45:46,083
This is nothing but
the magic of your marketing.

1674
01:45:46,250 --> 01:45:48,000
I just do my work.

1675
01:45:48,791 --> 01:45:50,875
It's the central
government that does magic.

1676
01:45:51,541 --> 01:45:52,916
Black magic.

1677
01:45:53,500 --> 01:45:54,666
Everything has disappeared.

1678
01:45:55,166 --> 01:45:56,750
Country's money disappeared.

1679
01:45:57,208 --> 01:45:59,125
Employment disappeared.

1680
01:46:00,208 --> 01:46:02,125
Coal, electricity..

1681
01:46:02,208 --> 01:46:05,875
..and also the Prime
Minister's voice disappeared.

1682
01:46:11,625 --> 01:46:14,875
Friends, now you take your decision.

1683
01:46:15,833 --> 01:46:17,791
Do you wish to listen
to their tape record..

1684
01:46:18,125 --> 01:46:20,125
..or track record of my developments?

1685
01:46:25,458 --> 01:46:26,666
This isn't working.

1686
01:46:26,916 --> 01:46:28,000
Change the line.

1687
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,916
Now, let's talk about the country.

1688
01:46:34,375 --> 01:46:36,541
- My next question is..
- Your question?

1689
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:39,375
Or their question?

1690
01:46:40,458 --> 01:46:41,625
What do you mean?

1691
01:46:42,791 --> 01:46:45,250
Strange remote control technology.

1692
01:46:45,791 --> 01:46:48,416
You're asking questions
scripted by others.

1693
01:46:53,750 --> 01:46:54,833
Okay, go ahead.

1694
01:46:54,916 --> 01:46:59,083
It's heard that now you're
dreaming to be the PM.

1695
01:46:59,500 --> 01:47:03,291
Your oppositions say
that if Modi becomes the PM..

1696
01:47:03,708 --> 01:47:05,541
..one more Kargil war will happen.

1697
01:47:05,625 --> 01:47:07,000
If Modi becomes the PM..

1698
01:47:07,416 --> 01:47:09,750
..our relation with China
will spoil all the more.

1699
01:47:09,833 --> 01:47:11,375
If Modi becomes the PM..

1700
01:47:12,125 --> 01:47:14,083
..he will encourage Hinduism.

1701
01:47:14,166 --> 01:47:17,916
You repeatedly said
if Modi becomes PM.

1702
01:47:19,333 --> 01:47:23,541
It seems more than me you're
dreaming to see me as PM.

1703
01:47:23,958 --> 01:47:25,166
That's a masterstroke.

1704
01:47:25,625 --> 01:47:26,750
It's not a joke, Modiji.

1705
01:47:28,666 --> 01:47:32,750
People are really scared
that if you become the PM..

1706
01:47:32,833 --> 01:47:35,458
..we will be in one more
war with Pakistan and China.

1707
01:47:36,625 --> 01:47:38,305
You're going to provoke
the Kashmir issue..

1708
01:47:39,208 --> 01:47:41,500
..and the country will be divided.

1709
01:47:43,958 --> 01:47:46,458
Which party formed Pakistan?

1710
01:47:48,083 --> 01:47:54,208
Which party divided
the unified India in 1947?

1711
01:47:55,625 --> 01:48:00,166
Had Sardar Patel been
the PM in place of Nehru..

1712
01:48:00,250 --> 01:48:02,833
..we'd have neither
lost the war with China.

1713
01:48:03,458 --> 01:48:06,208
Nor Pakistan would have
had half of the Kashmir.

1714
01:48:07,208 --> 01:48:09,958
Nor our brave soldiers
would have been killed..

1715
01:48:10,083 --> 01:48:13,416
..on the border by
the hands of terrorists.

1716
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:23,583
But, Modiji,
Hindustan is a secular country.

1717
01:48:24,583 --> 01:48:29,166
And people fear that you
will turn it into Hindu Nation.

1718
01:48:30,375 --> 01:48:32,958
Do you know the meaning of Hindustan?

1719
01:48:34,416 --> 01:48:38,750
Because Hinduism is not
just a religion but a thought.

1720
01:48:41,333 --> 01:48:44,750
Because of Hinduism,
the country is secular.

1721
01:48:46,375 --> 01:48:51,250
Because for us,
even a pundit is Hindu.

1722
01:48:52,500 --> 01:48:57,583
So is, human
who doesn't believe in idol-worship.

1723
01:48:58,083 --> 01:49:00,541
Not by the religion
but by the culture.

1724
01:49:02,666 --> 01:49:05,000
Hindustan is the only country where..

1725
01:49:06,416 --> 01:49:09,500
..Muslims pray on the road
and religious processions..

1726
01:49:10,750 --> 01:49:13,375
..of Hindus pass on the same road.

1727
01:49:13,833 --> 01:49:17,916
Secular countries like
France and Switzerland..

1728
01:49:18,666 --> 01:49:20,541
..have banned Hijab.

1729
01:49:21,958 --> 01:49:23,625
But not in India.

1730
01:49:24,166 --> 01:49:28,583
Only a Muslim can become
the President of Pakistan.

1731
01:49:29,458 --> 01:49:34,583
But in India, Abdul Kalam
had been the President once.

1732
01:49:37,125 --> 01:49:39,250
This is called Hindustan.

1733
01:49:40,333 --> 01:49:43,083
Here, one thing is above the religion.

1734
01:49:44,166 --> 01:49:45,625
Country.

1735
01:49:57,333 --> 01:49:58,333
Joshi.

1736
01:49:58,541 --> 01:50:00,083
Leave all that, Modiji.

1737
01:50:00,458 --> 01:50:07,208
Until you don't get a clean
chit in Godhra case by SIT court..

1738
01:50:07,666 --> 01:50:09,708
..how will you be able
to become the Prime Minister?

1739
01:50:10,458 --> 01:50:13,083
These are serious allegations on you.

1740
01:50:13,458 --> 01:50:14,708
Not just the public..

1741
01:50:14,958 --> 01:50:17,833
..how will your own party accept you?

1742
01:50:19,708 --> 01:50:22,833
You will get the answer
in next 30 seconds.

1743
01:50:24,208 --> 01:50:26,500
What do they say?

1744
01:50:27,250 --> 01:50:28,708
Breaking news.

1745
01:50:29,166 --> 01:50:32,583
For you and for them as well.

1746
01:50:33,708 --> 01:50:34,541
Modiji.

1747
01:50:34,625 --> 01:50:35,625
Jai Hind!

1748
01:50:36,125 --> 01:50:37,565
I'm not yet done with the interview.

1749
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,958
Modi. Modi.

1750
01:50:44,041 --> 01:50:47,541
Modi. Modi.

1751
01:50:47,625 --> 01:50:49,166
Modi. Modi.

1752
01:50:49,250 --> 01:50:51,708
Gujarat CM Narendra
Modi gets clean chit..

1753
01:50:51,958 --> 01:50:54,458
..in Godhra case by the SIT court.

1754
01:50:55,583 --> 01:51:00,708
Now, his path to the
position of PM is clear.

1755
01:51:06,416 --> 01:51:08,583
His eyes reflect passion
for his religion.

1756
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:11,583
If Modi wins..

1757
01:51:12,291 --> 01:51:13,750
..he will nail Pakistan.

1758
01:51:15,125 --> 01:51:18,166
You've given a befitting
reply to their lies.

1759
01:51:18,500 --> 01:51:20,833
They were forced
to clap on your answers.

1760
01:51:20,916 --> 01:51:21,625
Yes, sir.

1761
01:51:21,666 --> 01:51:23,346
Response to your
interview is mind blowing.

1762
01:51:23,458 --> 01:51:25,208
He's just a regional leader.

1763
01:51:25,458 --> 01:51:27,208
He's popular only in Gujarat.

1764
01:51:27,291 --> 01:51:30,708
To rule Delhi,
he has to win over UP first.

1765
01:51:30,791 --> 01:51:31,708
UP?

1766
01:51:31,791 --> 01:51:33,208
UP is our centre.

1767
01:51:33,291 --> 01:51:35,125
He won't dare file nomination in UP.

1768
01:51:35,916 --> 01:51:37,250
Tell me from where would you..

1769
01:51:37,333 --> 01:51:38,601
..file your nomination
for the election?

1770
01:51:38,625 --> 01:51:40,083
Ahmedabad or Gandhinagar?

1771
01:51:40,750 --> 01:51:41,833
Benaras.

1772
01:51:41,916 --> 01:51:43,125
Benaras?!

1773
01:51:55,708 --> 01:51:57,708
Neither anyone has sent me.

1774
01:51:59,250 --> 01:52:01,125
Nor have I come on my own.

1775
01:52:02,125 --> 01:52:03,375
Only..

1776
01:52:04,250 --> 01:52:05,833
..mother Ganges have called me.

1777
01:52:26,125 --> 01:52:27,500
Benaras.

1778
01:52:33,208 --> 01:52:35,250
People come here to sanctify.

1779
01:52:35,916 --> 01:52:37,291
Now, starting from this land..

1780
01:52:37,916 --> 01:52:39,666
..India will also sanctify.

1781
01:52:43,916 --> 01:52:46,750
Even the holy water
of Ganges can't sanctify..

1782
01:52:46,833 --> 01:52:52,125
..this government's
sins of past 10 years.

1783
01:52:56,708 --> 01:53:00,291
There are many questions
regarding country's future.

1784
01:53:01,291 --> 01:53:05,625
And Uttar Pradesh will
answer all those questions.

1785
01:53:09,125 --> 01:53:10,958
Are you with me?

1786
01:53:13,250 --> 01:53:14,875
Are you with me?

1787
01:53:16,375 --> 01:53:18,083
- I salute you..
- Motherland!

1788
01:53:18,166 --> 01:53:19,625
- I salute you..
- Motherland!

1789
01:53:19,708 --> 01:53:21,250
- I salute you..
- Motherland!

1790
01:53:22,791 --> 01:53:25,083
- I salute you..
- Motherland!

1791
01:53:36,583 --> 01:53:38,291
See..

1792
01:53:39,291 --> 01:53:42,208
Temple, Freedom and Ganges.

1793
01:53:42,958 --> 01:53:44,666
Modi talks only on these three points.

1794
01:53:45,625 --> 01:53:46,666
Ask him.

1795
01:53:46,708 --> 01:53:48,583
Why he didn't wear Muslim cap?

1796
01:53:48,666 --> 01:53:52,666
I don't fool people
by wearing any cap.

1797
01:53:54,333 --> 01:53:57,083
Their only agenda from past 60 years..

1798
01:53:57,166 --> 01:53:59,208
..was to tap minority
for the vote bank.

1799
01:54:01,208 --> 01:54:04,500
I will shut down
your vote bank account.

1800
01:54:04,708 --> 01:54:10,083
An illiterate tea-seller
can never become India's PM.

1801
01:54:10,583 --> 01:54:13,916
As a PM, how will he
converse with people abroad?

1802
01:54:14,666 --> 01:54:16,291
He doesn't even know English.

1803
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:20,833
This tea-seller knows
the meaning of ABCD.

1804
01:54:21,875 --> 01:54:27,583
Adarsh. Bofors.
Coal and 'Damadji' (son-in-law).

1805
01:54:27,875 --> 01:54:30,166
Modi. Modi.

1806
01:54:30,708 --> 01:54:32,916
ABCD.

1807
01:54:33,875 --> 01:54:37,291
I can count their scams till Z.

1808
01:54:40,916 --> 01:54:43,291
Learning English is no big deal.

1809
01:54:44,166 --> 01:54:46,833
I can teach Hindi to the foreigners.

1810
01:54:47,250 --> 01:54:52,208
Don't forget what he did in Gujarat.

1811
01:54:53,500 --> 01:54:55,750
He has a criminal past.

1812
01:54:57,083 --> 01:55:03,166
If you elect him, he will
turn India into another Gujarat.

1813
01:55:03,458 --> 01:55:07,916
It requires courage to make Gujarat.

1814
01:55:08,458 --> 01:55:11,375
It requires clear intentions
to make concrete roads.

1815
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:15,458
And brilliance of mind to
bring electricity for 24 hours.

1816
01:55:17,333 --> 01:55:20,166
Yes, I am a dealer.

1817
01:55:21,291 --> 01:55:24,166
Not of the lives
but of the developments.

1818
01:55:24,625 --> 01:55:27,458
What do you exactly deal with?

1819
01:55:28,291 --> 01:55:29,666
Do you have any answer?

1820
01:55:31,708 --> 01:55:35,916
My last rally will be
on the Gandhi Ground of Patna.

1821
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:39,291
And this battle will end in Delhi only.

1822
01:55:39,416 --> 01:55:40,666
He's right.

1823
01:55:41,958 --> 01:55:44,916
This will be his last rally.

1824
01:55:45,291 --> 01:55:48,000
This time we will not
send jihadis but soldiers.

1825
01:55:50,083 --> 01:55:53,083
My boys will go in your uniform.

1826
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:56,520
When will your officer
reach here, sir?

1827
01:55:58,375 --> 01:56:00,666
They have already reached Delhi.

1828
01:56:01,708 --> 01:56:03,708
There's no Modi-wave

1829
01:56:03,958 --> 01:56:05,875
But ma'am, survey shows the fact.

1830
01:56:06,166 --> 01:56:07,708
Even our intelligence reports states..

1831
01:56:07,791 --> 01:56:09,291
..that he has gone much ahead of us.

1832
01:56:09,666 --> 01:56:10,708
He's wining, ma'am.

1833
01:56:12,708 --> 01:56:15,166
- A bad news, ma'am.
- Now what?

1834
01:56:16,500 --> 01:56:18,583
As per the Intelligence Bureau..

1835
01:56:19,208 --> 01:56:21,666
..terrorists have entered in India.

1836
01:56:21,750 --> 01:56:23,750
And their mission is to kill Modi.

1837
01:56:25,083 --> 01:56:27,666
- That's really a bad news.
- Yes.

1838
01:56:27,833 --> 01:56:31,208
This isn't media's conspiracy
or any political move.

1839
01:56:31,291 --> 01:56:33,208
This is intelligence's confirm report.

1840
01:56:33,291 --> 01:56:35,171
Sir, the terrorists
have already reached Patna..

1841
01:56:35,208 --> 01:56:37,625
..just to target you,
on Gandhi Ground.

1842
01:56:37,708 --> 01:56:40,708
- You must cancel this rally, Narendrbhai.
- No.

1843
01:56:46,291 --> 01:56:47,958
Media will get a breaking news..

1844
01:56:48,041 --> 01:56:49,750
..and opposition will get a topic..

1845
01:56:50,291 --> 01:56:51,291
..that Modi has escaped.

1846
01:56:51,375 --> 01:56:52,666
But Narendrabhai

1847
01:56:52,750 --> 01:56:54,708
I don't care about them.

1848
01:56:55,208 --> 01:56:59,083
Every hopeful eye
of Indians towards me..

1849
01:57:00,250 --> 01:57:01,833
..will be disappointed.

1850
01:57:03,166 --> 01:57:05,625
He, who thinks of
his own safety first..

1851
01:57:05,666 --> 01:57:07,583
..how will he protect the country?

1852
01:57:07,666 --> 01:57:10,208
Sorry, sir.
But Indiraji, Rajiv Gandhi.

1853
01:57:10,291 --> 01:57:11,851
They had also received
intelligent reports.

1854
01:57:11,875 --> 01:57:13,750
- But they ignored.
- Joshi.

1855
01:57:15,708 --> 01:57:18,333
I'm going to Delhi, not to run away..

1856
01:57:18,625 --> 01:57:20,465
..from those terrorists
but to drive them away.

1857
01:57:21,708 --> 01:57:22,750
Hello, mother.

1858
01:57:23,291 --> 01:57:25,333
Narendrabhai is not ready to listen.

1859
01:57:26,291 --> 01:57:27,708
You please reason him.

1860
01:57:34,416 --> 01:57:35,500
Hello, mom.

1861
01:57:36,166 --> 01:57:38,208
Mom, I've come very far.

1862
01:57:39,333 --> 01:57:41,250
Now don't tell me to step back.

1863
01:57:41,416 --> 01:57:43,375
No, I will never.

1864
01:57:44,750 --> 01:57:46,291
Go ahead, son.

1865
01:57:47,708 --> 01:57:52,958
In your childhood,
you said you want to become a soldier.

1866
01:57:54,458 --> 01:57:55,500
And see.

1867
01:57:56,583 --> 01:57:58,708
Today you've become a
solider without the uniform.

1868
01:58:02,750 --> 01:58:05,583
Are you crying?

1869
01:58:08,416 --> 01:58:11,041
A soldier's mother never cries.

1870
01:58:12,333 --> 01:58:13,791
In fact, she's always proud.

1871
01:58:15,583 --> 01:58:17,333
I'm proud of you.

1872
01:58:18,958 --> 01:58:20,041
Jai Hind!

1873
01:58:22,083 --> 01:58:23,333
Jai Hind, mom!

1874
01:58:32,958 --> 01:58:35,791
Tomorrow at 7 PM. Gandhi Ground, Patna.

1875
01:58:37,083 --> 01:58:39,041
If you want to change
the fate of this country..

1876
01:58:39,250 --> 01:58:41,625
..then we must face our own fears.

1877
01:59:03,041 --> 01:59:03,583
Sir.

1878
01:59:03,666 --> 01:59:06,000
Ajay, what's the security update?

1879
01:59:06,083 --> 01:59:08,059
Sir, scanners are installed
at all the entry points.

1880
01:59:08,083 --> 01:59:09,541
Police are doubled in number now.

1881
01:59:09,625 --> 01:59:11,684
Me and my team will be
in the crowd in civil dresses.

1882
01:59:11,708 --> 01:59:15,125
I've ordered the dog squad
to check the stage area once again.

1883
01:59:15,208 --> 01:59:18,166
Aman Bhargav.
Counter terrorism security expert.

1884
01:59:18,500 --> 01:59:20,125
What's your opinion?

1885
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:24,166
Sir, cancel this rally.
Threat is live.

1886
01:59:24,833 --> 01:59:26,458
Crowd will be in millions.

1887
01:59:27,041 --> 01:59:28,333
It will be impossible to secure.

1888
01:59:28,416 --> 01:59:30,166
We will have to make it possible.

1889
01:59:30,250 --> 01:59:33,083
Modi. Modi.

1890
01:59:33,291 --> 01:59:34,291
- Ajay.
- Sir.

1891
01:59:34,375 --> 01:59:36,351
Both the sides of the stage,
in the centre over here..

1892
01:59:36,375 --> 01:59:38,041
..and on both the
sides of the main gate..

1893
01:59:38,208 --> 01:59:40,125
I want snipers.
I want to cover everything.

1894
01:59:40,208 --> 01:59:41,500
And I need four drones.

1895
01:59:41,666 --> 01:59:43,041
I want security camera feed..

1896
01:59:43,125 --> 01:59:44,000
..from every angle.

1897
01:59:44,083 --> 01:59:45,083
Yes, sir.

1898
01:59:48,291 --> 01:59:50,666
Hey, what are you doing here?

1899
01:59:50,708 --> 01:59:51,833
Nothing, sir. Just coming.

1900
01:59:51,958 --> 01:59:53,998
- Check the wiring on the stage. Quick.
- Okay, sir.

1901
01:59:55,208 --> 01:59:56,291
Give me drones' feed.

1902
02:00:08,041 --> 02:00:08,750
Where have you reached?

1903
02:00:08,958 --> 02:00:10,416
Sir, I'm still stuck up here.

1904
02:00:10,500 --> 02:00:11,500
What?

1905
02:00:12,083 --> 02:00:13,666
Sir, don't worry. Weapons are with me.

1906
02:00:13,750 --> 02:00:14,750
Hurry up.

1907
02:00:14,958 --> 02:00:16,559
There're news of possible
terror attack on Modiji.

1908
02:00:16,583 --> 02:00:18,500
Still you've come here.
Aren't you scared?

1909
02:00:18,583 --> 02:00:19,625
Modiji, says..

1910
02:00:19,666 --> 02:00:22,500
..overcome your fear.

1911
02:00:24,291 --> 02:00:25,458
What is your opinion?

1912
02:00:25,541 --> 02:00:27,333
This time, we want Modi Government.

1913
02:00:27,416 --> 02:00:28,875
Modi! Modi!

1914
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:30,708
Modi! Modi!

1915
02:00:35,333 --> 02:00:36,416
Number two.

1916
02:00:36,500 --> 02:00:37,208
What's the update?

1917
02:00:37,291 --> 02:00:39,791
I am in, sir.

1918
02:00:40,291 --> 02:00:40,791
Good.

1919
02:00:40,875 --> 02:00:41,583
Number two.

1920
02:00:41,708 --> 02:00:43,041
Modi's convoy is here.

1921
02:00:44,791 --> 02:00:46,291
Move fast and stay sharp.

1922
02:00:55,875 --> 02:00:56,625
Number two.

1923
02:00:56,666 --> 02:00:57,666
Where have you reached?

1924
02:00:57,708 --> 02:00:59,625
Sir, right under the stage.

1925
02:01:06,666 --> 02:01:08,791
There will be explosion at 3:15.

1926
02:01:10,583 --> 02:01:12,250
Everyone be alert.

1927
02:01:13,916 --> 02:01:15,875
Sir, we are ready.

1928
02:01:36,250 --> 02:01:38,625
Leave them. Release them.
Follow, follow, follow.

1929
02:01:42,583 --> 02:01:43,666
Let's go. Quick.

1930
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:46,916
- I salute you..
- Motherland!

1931
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:48,708
- I salute you..
- Motherland!

1932
02:01:48,791 --> 02:01:50,541
- I salute you..
- Motherland!

1933
02:02:01,791 --> 02:02:04,375
Thank you for coming here..

1934
02:02:04,458 --> 02:02:06,375
..even in this dangerous situation.

1935
02:02:06,541 --> 02:02:07,916
Modi. Modi.

1936
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,416
This is a message to our enemy..

1937
02:02:11,333 --> 02:02:14,208
..that our country comes
first and then our life.

1938
02:02:16,791 --> 02:02:18,000
Sir, we've nabbed one.

1939
02:02:18,083 --> 02:02:19,083
But he is jihadi.

1940
02:02:19,166 --> 02:02:20,166
What?

1941
02:02:20,625 --> 02:02:23,333
Not us, but they are scared today.

1942
02:02:24,875 --> 02:02:27,416
They could neither win
us on the battleground..

1943
02:02:27,500 --> 02:02:29,000
..nor on the cricket ground.

1944
02:02:30,958 --> 02:02:33,666
That's why they've come
here to fix this election.

1945
02:02:34,958 --> 02:02:38,708
But your presence over here
is a befitting reply to them.

1946
02:02:40,875 --> 02:02:42,392
Sir, there are two
more officers with him..

1947
02:02:42,416 --> 02:02:43,458
..on this mission.

1948
02:02:43,541 --> 02:02:45,541
Sir, I'm sending a
team on his safe house.

1949
02:02:51,583 --> 02:02:53,041
They can be anywhere in the crowd.

1950
02:02:57,125 --> 02:02:57,791
What's the update?

1951
02:02:57,875 --> 02:02:59,291
We searched the entire crowd.

1952
02:02:59,375 --> 02:03:01,041
But can't get the face match?

1953
02:03:01,125 --> 02:03:02,916
Send these images to the entry point.

1954
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:04,458
Send it to the security check.

1955
02:03:04,541 --> 02:03:05,541
Send it on every gate.

1956
02:03:05,583 --> 02:03:06,583
Immediately.

1957
02:03:08,916 --> 02:03:11,625
Modi. Modi.

1958
02:03:11,708 --> 02:03:14,666
Modi. Modi.

1959
02:03:14,750 --> 02:03:17,625
Modi. Modi.

1960
02:03:17,708 --> 02:03:20,125
Modi. Modi.

1961
02:03:21,500 --> 02:03:25,125
Modi. Modi.

1962
02:03:25,208 --> 02:03:28,666
Modi. Modi.

1963
02:03:31,916 --> 02:03:32,916
I am in, sir.

1964
02:03:33,083 --> 02:03:34,541
I'm reaching him.

1965
02:03:39,166 --> 02:03:40,750
Hey, he just passed from here.

1966
02:03:40,833 --> 02:03:41,958
He had a red bag.

1967
02:03:42,541 --> 02:03:44,416
Hello, sir.
He has just passed from here..

1968
02:03:44,500 --> 02:03:45,500
..with a red bag.

1969
02:03:45,583 --> 02:03:47,041
Move drone towards the entry point.

1970
02:03:47,125 --> 02:03:48,726
And give me all the
camera feeds from there.

1971
02:03:48,750 --> 02:03:50,333
Take camera seven behind.

1972
02:03:50,833 --> 02:03:51,916
Sir, red bag.

1973
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:53,500
And it perfectly matches the image.

1974
02:03:53,625 --> 02:03:55,041
Ajay, get there with your team.

1975
02:03:55,125 --> 02:03:56,565
I will send his location right away.

1976
02:03:59,250 --> 02:04:01,125
There he is. Don't lose him.
Don't lose him.

1977
02:04:02,875 --> 02:04:03,875
Where did he go?

1978
02:04:04,166 --> 02:04:05,708
Find him. He's somewhere there.

1979
02:04:06,375 --> 02:04:08,208
He's disappeared.
There he is.

1980
02:04:08,625 --> 02:04:11,125
For them, only one family is India.

1981
02:04:11,791 --> 02:04:15,000
But for me, India is my family.

1982
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,791
They are scared that
Modi will get elected.

1983
02:04:21,541 --> 02:04:25,000
Only the corrupts are afraid of Modi.

1984
02:04:53,333 --> 02:04:54,625
There he is, sir.

1985
02:04:55,750 --> 02:04:56,870
But he doesn't have red bag.

1986
02:04:56,916 --> 02:04:58,309
He must have given
it to the three men.

1987
02:04:58,333 --> 02:04:59,750
I am sure, the weapons are in it.

1988
02:04:59,833 --> 02:05:00,833
Also find the three guy.

1989
02:05:00,875 --> 02:05:01,958
Look for the red bag.

1990
02:05:02,041 --> 02:05:03,041
Yes, sir.

1991
02:05:05,208 --> 02:05:06,708
Ajay, go there. Go fast.

1992
02:05:06,791 --> 02:05:08,041
Catch him.

1993
02:05:20,625 --> 02:05:21,875
Yes.

1994
02:05:24,666 --> 02:05:25,666
Number two.

1995
02:05:25,916 --> 02:05:28,000
It's 3:15, but there's no explosion.

1996
02:05:28,500 --> 02:05:29,250
Number two.

1997
02:05:29,500 --> 02:05:30,750
Number two. Come in.

1998
02:05:31,083 --> 02:05:32,083
Number two.

1999
02:05:32,333 --> 02:05:33,333
Damn it.

2000
02:05:34,833 --> 02:05:36,083
They say..

2001
02:05:36,375 --> 02:05:39,583
..a tea-seller can't
be the PM of this country.

2002
02:05:39,666 --> 02:05:41,958
Yes, I am a tea-seller.

2003
02:05:44,708 --> 02:05:46,125
I used to sell the tea.

2004
02:05:46,666 --> 02:05:48,708
But not the country, like they did.

2005
02:05:55,291 --> 02:05:57,666
Every soldier can become
the PM of this country.

2006
02:05:59,583 --> 02:06:01,083
It's a hologram.

2007
02:06:01,166 --> 02:06:03,916
Every sanitation worker
can become the PM of this country.

2008
02:06:05,750 --> 02:06:08,375
Every farmer can become
the PM of this country.

2009
02:06:08,666 --> 02:06:10,666
India has changed.

2010
02:06:10,750 --> 02:06:14,625
Now, not your ancestral name
but your work will be noticed.

2011
02:06:19,041 --> 02:06:22,666
Sir, we found two of them.
But three one is still not on radar.

2012
02:06:52,250 --> 02:06:56,958
If 125 crores of Indians
take a step together..

2013
02:06:57,916 --> 02:07:00,791
..India will progress
by 125 crores of steps.

2014
02:07:02,833 --> 02:07:04,208
They can kill me.

2015
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:07,875
But not Modi.

2016
02:07:11,208 --> 02:07:14,916
Because Modi is not
a human but a thought.

2017
02:07:16,833 --> 02:07:18,333
Modi is alive in every heart.

2018
02:07:21,583 --> 02:07:25,375
Modi. Modi.

2019
02:07:25,458 --> 02:07:29,125
Modi. Modi.

2020
02:07:29,208 --> 02:07:31,833
Modi. Modi.

2021
02:07:31,916 --> 02:07:33,791
- Sir, red bag.
- That's him. Get him.

2022
02:07:38,041 --> 02:07:39,500
Sniper, do you have a clear shot?

2023
02:07:41,541 --> 02:07:42,892
- He's hiding amongst the public.
- Modi. Modi.

2024
02:07:42,916 --> 02:07:44,351
It's difficult to get a clear shot, sir.

2025
02:07:44,375 --> 02:07:48,083
Modi. Modi.

2026
02:07:48,291 --> 02:07:50,125
Possible that sniper
can't get a clear shot.

2027
02:07:50,208 --> 02:07:53,708
Modi. Modi.

2028
02:07:53,791 --> 02:07:55,125
Ajay, over there.

2029
02:07:55,750 --> 02:07:57,416
- Sir.
- Sniper can't get a clear shot.

2030
02:07:57,708 --> 02:07:59,250
Modi. Modi.

2031
02:07:59,333 --> 02:08:00,708
Arrest him. Go ahead.

2032
02:08:00,791 --> 02:08:02,416
Modi. Modi.

2033
02:08:02,500 --> 02:08:04,541
Modi. Modi.

2034
02:08:04,625 --> 02:08:08,333
Modi. Modi.

2035
02:08:08,416 --> 02:08:09,583
Arrest him.

2036
02:08:09,666 --> 02:08:11,708
Modi. Modi.

2037
02:08:11,750 --> 02:08:14,583
Modi. Modi.

2038
02:08:14,666 --> 02:08:17,208
Modi. Modi.

2039
02:08:17,291 --> 02:08:20,500
Hail Motherland India!

2040
02:08:20,583 --> 02:08:24,083
Narendra Damodardas Modi will
be India's 14th Prime Minister.

2041
02:08:24,166 --> 02:08:26,708
After 1984, this is the first party to..

2042
02:08:26,791 --> 02:08:28,708
..exclusively win 284 seats..

2043
02:08:28,750 --> 02:08:30,541
..and achieve absolute majority.

2044
02:08:35,166 --> 02:08:38,166
Invitation to the swear-in ceremony.

2045
02:08:49,625 --> 02:08:53,458
I, Narendra Damodardas Modi..

2046
02:08:54,458 --> 02:08:56,458
..do swear in the name of God..

2047
02:09:26,875 --> 02:09:32,541
"Like the passion in my eyes."

2048
02:09:32,625 --> 02:09:38,333
"In my blood.."

2049
02:09:38,458 --> 02:09:44,041
"runs this country."

2050
02:09:44,125 --> 02:09:49,583
"This life is yours."

2051
02:09:49,875 --> 02:09:55,500
"I'm just your servant,
O Motherland."

2052
02:09:55,583 --> 02:10:01,291
"I haven't done anything."

2053
02:10:01,375 --> 02:10:06,916
"I just paid you back that I owed."

2054
02:10:06,958 --> 02:10:12,541
"No religion should have any complaint."

2055
02:10:12,625 --> 02:10:18,291
"In the name of which,
we hurt others."

2056
02:10:18,375 --> 02:10:24,041
"Like the passion in my eyes.."

2057
02:10:46,833 --> 02:10:51,958
"The Almighty is same for all."

2058
02:10:52,708 --> 02:10:57,625
"Why people fight
in the name of religion?"

2059
02:10:58,416 --> 02:11:03,250
"Tricolor flag represents
our diversity in unity."

2060
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:08,833
"Then how any two religions
be treated differently?"

2061
02:11:09,041 --> 02:11:14,666
"Let bygones be bygones."

2062
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:21,125
"This is a new era,
this is a new world."

2063
02:11:21,208 --> 02:11:26,500
"Let religion not divide us."

2064
02:11:26,583 --> 02:11:32,208
"Let there be no sign on hatred."

2065
02:11:38,458 --> 02:11:43,916
"We make our country."

2066
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:49,416
"We are a part of this country.."

2067
02:11:49,833 --> 02:11:55,291
"and this country is a part of us."

2068
