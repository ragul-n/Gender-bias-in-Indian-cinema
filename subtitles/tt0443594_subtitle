93
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,000

No need for many of these processes will run away from here

99
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,900
Shush not say such things

100
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,700
This could be your operation last

101
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,800
After that electrostatic

102
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:39,000
But they told me you were coming back home tomorrow

103
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,100

112
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,000
She died while she slept

113
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,100
But I saw her last night

114
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,900
Maybe I went with someone else

115
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:51,300
This is impossible, it was a coma for five months, O Nina

116
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,000

00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,300

My grandmother

135
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,000

None of my grandmother

139
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,500
Nurse told me that he could get me some complications

140
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:07,300
Nina aunt Parvati

Let's "Go now and rest a bit

144
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:19,900
Do not ever walk again with eyes closed

145
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,500
Your days ended in the dark forever, O Nina

146
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,600
Do you understand?

147
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,500
Yes, at four o'clock Good

148
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,600
What do you think of this? There is no need to marry my grandmother

149
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,100
And this? Not

150
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,700
And this? Not

151
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,100
Good morning

152
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,100
Ms. Shah? It is I, Dr.

153
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,700
It is my granddaughter Rafiqini to my office

Do you go? And this?

155
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,600
I took off my glasses my grandmother

156
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,500
Calm down Nina

157
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,400
I am a psychologist

158
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,400
But you did not come for mental problems

159
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:14,400
The gift of sight is a precious gift

160
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,600
But if there are things that Sandra and I am still not out Taatarvi

161
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:23,100
Are the only things stored memory

162
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,900
For example

163
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,600
Do you see what is this, O Nina?

164
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,900
Without shyness, according Tell me what you see

165
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,100
This stapler

166
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:53,600
You will need some time to consider things Terpti

167
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,500
Can be difficult but it is not even necessary to worry

168
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,100
Do you hold what I mean?

169
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,200
bene

170
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,200
Must be understanding that modern medicine

171
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:08,300
See the emotional experiences

172
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,500
When we look at things just do not know what they are

173
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,800
But feel the emotion towards them as well

174
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,300
Now Close your eyes for a moment

175
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,600
Nina you're beautiful too

176
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,300

177
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:36,600
Look for me and now I'm getting a good O Nina

178
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,800
Nina you're beautiful too

179
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:52,000
As I said previously unknown you are already a beautiful vantage

180
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,200
But Conti Stsedkinni

181
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,900
When I looked into your eyes

182
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,500
Truth

183
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,900

184
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:07,700

Doctor, you seem a decent man

187
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:23,800
I think that the time for your finish

188
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:28,600
Good that Nina is the last day of Marbti

189
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:32,500
Perhaps now, but did not ask?

190
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,700
I tell you the truth I have to go to the temple

191
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:39,700
Can you be accompanied by Nina to a taxi, please?

192
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:43,600
My grandmother, I can do this myself, shut up

193
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,500
Well not a problem

194
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,500
Thank you for Amnesty

195
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,700
My grandmother

196
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,800
Am I beautiful?

197
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,700
Why? Did not the doctor Bkavi praise?

198
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,600
My grandmother

199
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,600
Did you see my mother? Who is your mother?

200
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,700
With you to offer details of Nina?

201
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:33,900
A girl looking for her mother, my grandmother

202
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,400
May be those that steal things

203
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,300
Nina

204
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,900
My aunt Pavarti

205
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,100
What, your daughter?

206
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,300
Have you ever dreamed a nightmare?

207
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,500
There is no thing, my dear

208
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,100
Did not you tell your grandmother, right?

209
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,300
No No

210
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,800

And will miss one month

215
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,800

00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,800
I want to see Nina again

217
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,500

241
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,800
No, this is everything

242
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,600

What happened?

249
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,500
What happened?

250
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,000
I told you that there are things to come

251
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,800
This is quite normal, do not worry

252
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,600
Ante now need to rest

253
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,400
However, Samir

254
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:51,300
There is nothing to be afraid of it, O Nina

255
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:55,200
What Znntih that it exists

256
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,500
Is just a hallucination

257
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,900
It was only two, have agreed?

258
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,300
They?

259
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,900
I saw that girl

260
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,100
Nina Ante

261
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,600
You'll be fine

262
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:11,500
I'll give you some medicine

263
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:16,500
I think I'm going crazy, is not it?

264
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,900
This is ridiculous when you say that

265
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,500
These pills will help you sleep

266
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,700
Take them

267
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,700

268
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,500

00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,300
You do not believe what I say to you

272
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,700
Hear Nina

273
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,200
Sorry

274
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,100
I'm too tired

275
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,600
My grandmother's grandmother

276
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,700
Open the door

277
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:54,900
My grandmother

278
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,900
My grandmother

279
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,600
Open the door

280
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:44,300
I know you're angry

281
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,000
I'll come another day

282
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,900
Your position here that you are right

283
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,200
I can not imagine

284
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:56,100
That what you see happen to you

285
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:00,600
But I try my Nina

286
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:02,300
I am sure that this

287
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,900
A medical explanation

288
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,000
Should help me

289
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,500
Up out of the problem

290
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,500
Will not let you suffer from this and I promise

291
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:50,500
Annie

292
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,200
I came to say goodbye, my Nina

293
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,300
Why?

294
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
What do you mean, are you okay?

295
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,700
I will not need for other operations

296
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,300
As I said, right?

297
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:09,300
The latter was your process easy

298
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,300
I'll come to see you

299
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,300
Do not forget that we'll see Queen

300
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:24,300
No

301
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:33,700
I do not go

302
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:42,500
operating room

303
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,900
What's up Nina and what are you doing sitting here?

304
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:59,600
Annie will die

305
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,100
What a stupid

306
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:03,900
Now conducting a process

307
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,400
Die

308
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:04,600
These dead

309
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:07,000
Those frightening visions of the dead

310
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,500
The tormented souls

311
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,700
Did you demonstrate your suffering for me?

312
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:22,700
Mass in memory of Annie ended

313
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:26,500
Did not teach me all this?

314
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,800
Why?

315
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,500
Why am I your gift?

316
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:37,400
Is this mean that I have a son .... ?

317
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:40,700
Did not have those horrific visions?

318
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:43,200
Any evil done?

319
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,100
Any evil done until I see the ghost?

320
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:50,200
Torment of fear everywhere I did not put

321
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:53,700
I am afraid that get attached to them

322
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,600
I do not want to be featured

323
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,900
I do not want to be the gift

324
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:00,800
Oonti you all right?

325
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,500
For a moment, I'll take the car

326
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:05,100
Oh no Samir, I'll go by myself

327
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:06,100
I

328
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:08,400
It is necessary to go alone, please

329
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:12,500
Wait, Annie gave me this explanation, you

330
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:16,900
It's a beautiful picture of Annie and you

331
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:20,100
Thank you and goodbye

332
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:34,900
Spoke

333
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:36,100
Nina hello Samir

334
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:37,000
Have you arrived?

335
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,800
No, I have two

336
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:42,600
I wanted to assure that you are okay

337
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:46,600
Samir, there is an error in the form of Annie

338
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:48,100
What do you mean?

339
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:52,200
In the picture there is another girl, not me

340
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:54,100
Why? Of course you

341
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:55,200
Why?

342
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:59,100
I saw that, did not do you recognize yourself?

343
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,700

Nina then open the door

You're right, we have many in common

359
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,200
How long you plan to Thabsi yourself?

360
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,700
I do not understand Do you pretend?

361
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:05,500
If you would like Vsakzk to the hospital

362
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,400
I can not do anything else

363
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:23,000
My grandmother, please wait here

364
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,600
Well I will command my son

365
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:56,100
Nina please

00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:58,900
Do not hurt yourself

367
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:03,100
A'Ala say something?

368
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,700
Listen, Nina, if Takulai

370
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:16,400
Do not you want to know everything

00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:19,700
Should get out of here

372
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:22,200
What is this that I do not understand?

373
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:29,200
Why?

374
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:34,100
Nina, this isn'ta picture of the mirror reflective? Why?

375
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:35,700
Exactly

376
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,400
You see me the mirror, right?

377
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,900
I do not understand, what is this joke?

378
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:44,900
I am a girl the other reflected

379
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:55,100

Sanjay tells that this vision

449
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:18,700
When we are prisoners of our feelings

450
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:20,900
Such as love, greed and anger

451
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:25,300
However, we do not see what you want hidden desire

452
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:30,200
Therefore, these desires may be of dire consequences

453
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:32,300
In the moment of death

454
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:34,600

The same place from time to time

459
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:56,400
Therefore, we must wonder

How can I live without you? And not born?

01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:07,900
Why was I born, Tlni to the whole world?

Away from the road

647
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:00,300
In the moment of death

648
01:29:00,500 --> 01:29:02,900

01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:06,300
Love, which should be not recover his

There was an incident where I saw black shadows

704
01:37:20,700 --> 01:37:23,600
But police do not know anything

705
01:37:23,900 --> 01:37:27,200

712
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:53,100

Do you want death? Driven out of this train

721
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:40,900
Each person will die

722
01:41:08,300 --> 01:41:11,700
Nina, what's going on this train, O Samir

723
01:41:11,900 --> 01:41:15,400

After six months

734
01:44:45,400 --> 01:44:47,200
I realized on that day

735
01:44:48,700 --> 01:44:51,300
Has decided to end her life Kaemi

736
01:44:52,300 --> 01:44:57,300
How can a person afford such a deficit

737
01:44:59,100 --> 01:45:01,100
In my case was different

738
01:45:01,700 --> 01:45:05,200
My grandmother's faith and love of Samir

739
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:08,500
Rescued

740
01:45:11,400 --> 01:45:15,500
May be true that I have the gift of the Lord

741
01:45:17,200 --> 01:45:21,500
What if my life were not very bright dark?

742
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:28,100
How would live the life of a very beautiful, even if without a consideration?

743
01:45:30,400 --> 01:46:15,100
Speedorino with greetings

744
