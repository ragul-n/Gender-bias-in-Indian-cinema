00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:25,777
Sabarwal International School...

3
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:28,507
...is one of the top
five schools in India.

4
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:29,809
Straight, and one...

5
00:02:30,149 --> 00:02:32,674
Our teachers are
not just from India...

6
00:02:33,085 --> 00:02:35,315
...they come from abroad too.

7
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:36,582
Very good, now put your hands down.

8
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,590
The motto of our school is...

9
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:42,453
"Education is the Birth
Right of every Child."

10
00:02:42,528 --> 00:02:44,155
Very nice. - But...

11
00:02:45,164 --> 00:02:47,689
I cannot help you with
your nephew's admission.

12
00:02:48,634 --> 00:02:49,498
I mean...

13
00:02:50,903 --> 00:02:51,767
Look at this.

14
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:54,099
You can forget about fifth grade.

15
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,835
According to our school standards...

16
00:02:56,909 --> 00:02:59,469
...we cannot admit him
in second grade either.

17
00:03:01,547 --> 00:03:03,139
Look at him.

18
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:07,014
He's only interested
in playing video-games.

19
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:08,781
Sorry, sir.

20
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:12,022
Whenever Bittoo's nervous,
he starts playing.

21
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:15,760
Since his parents demise,
he's got only two supports.

22
00:03:16,128 --> 00:03:19,063
Rimpi, and that PSP.

23
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:20,697
He's completely addicted to it.

24
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,328
But, don't worry.

25
00:03:22,668 --> 00:03:25,228
I'll personally do
his homework and projects.

26
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:27,232
Like all other parents.

27
00:03:27,306 --> 00:03:30,571
Just... admit him in your school,
Mr. Principal.

28
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:39,809
What's this?

29
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:42,747
Gift for sister-in-law.
- What nonsense!

30
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:44,221
Get out! Get out!

31
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:47,253
Not out, look in. In!

32
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:00,029
There's more.

33
00:04:05,811 --> 00:04:07,301
Rascal!

34
00:04:08,247 --> 00:04:09,509
You dare try to do
a Sting operation on me.

35
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,214
You think you're some kind of a hero.

36
00:04:11,283 --> 00:04:12,773
Who sent you?

37
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:14,450
You will be the star tomorrow, sir.

38
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,545
When you'll have more media
people running after you...

39
00:04:16,622 --> 00:04:18,249
...than Aamir Khan.

40
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:19,689
'Kabootar'! - 'Kabootar? '

41
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,227
Hey, what are you doing?

42
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:34,764
Good morning, sir.

43
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,205
Good morning.

44
00:04:55,227 --> 00:04:58,788
"Why do you follow me?
Why do you pull me back?"

45
00:04:58,864 --> 00:05:02,061
"Why are you after me?"

46
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:06,163
"Come face me,
and I'll slap you hard."

47
00:05:06,238 --> 00:05:09,002
"Everyone say with me."

48
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:17,346
"Play on."

49
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:24,345
"Play on."

50
00:05:24,423 --> 00:05:27,051
"You'll face the music."

51
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,220
"Yes, you'll face the music."

52
00:05:32,364 --> 00:05:35,800
"You eat my bread and snap at me! "

53
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:39,367
"You look like a dog."

54
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:43,436
"If you come back,
I'll slap you again."

55
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,603
"Everyone say with me."

56
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:50,309
"Play on."

57
00:05:50,382 --> 00:05:53,476
Girlfriend tells her boyfriend
to quickly remove her top.

58
00:05:53,552 --> 00:05:54,576
Boyfriend says okay.

59
00:05:54,653 --> 00:05:59,283
"Play on." - And then girlfriend tells
her boyfriend to now remove her skirt.

60
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:00,689
Boyfriend says okay.

61
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,627
Girlfriend scolds and says...
Dare you wear my clothes again!

62
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:20,142
"It's either this guy or that...
just play on."

63
00:06:20,212 --> 00:06:24,273
"Play on."

64
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,478
"Here or there, just play on."

65
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:31,546
"Play on."

66
00:06:32,057 --> 00:06:35,356
"It's either this guy or that...
just play on."

67
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:39,189
"Here or there, just play on."

68
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:45,500
"Play on."

69
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:52,204
"Play on."

70
00:07:00,152 --> 00:07:02,086
Sukhi!

71
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:04,052
Did you get admission?

72
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:05,750
When are the exams?
- Sooner than you expect...

73
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:07,753
The principal's right
behind us with the exam sheets.

74
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:11,492
Let him come.

75
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:33,578
Balloo. Gun!

76
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:35,743
Is he a principal or a shooter?

77
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,213
Balloo!

78
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:54,797
Sukhi, are you having fun?

79
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:56,637
It's just like when we used to...

80
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:57,801
...flee from Agarwal's
house with the noodles.

81
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,668
But, Agarwal never fired at us.

82
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,068
This way.

83
00:08:01,146 --> 00:08:01,737
Stop.

84
00:08:02,147 --> 00:08:04,377
Stop, you rascals.

85
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:10,453
There you go, mom.

86
00:08:10,522 --> 00:08:13,286
Our local cable's ready
to broadcast breaking news.

87
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:15,652
Shall I press the button?
- No, 'Kabootar'.

88
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:18,063
This game's all about 'timing'.

89
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,724
This goes on air only when
I get the message from Ballu.

90
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:24,661
Wait.

91
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:31,335
Rascals!

92
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:33,400
Come out!

93
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,777
You think you can make
breaking news out of me.

94
00:08:36,081 --> 00:08:36,775
Rascals!

95
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:39,317
You don't know who I am.

96
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:42,986
Mr. Sethi, we're your true admirers.

97
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,519
And, we want to make you famous.

98
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:49,322
If you don't believe us,
call your wife. - Wife?

99
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:51,229
What did you two did with my wife?

100
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:53,663
Lover-boy. When you don't
do anything with your wife...

101
00:08:53,732 --> 00:08:56,292
...what do you expect us to do? Dance?

102
00:08:56,368 --> 00:08:59,804
Stop firing.
It'll just make things worse.

103
00:09:00,205 --> 00:09:01,570
Call your wife.

104
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,670
Hello. - Hello. Pammi.

105
00:09:06,578 --> 00:09:08,671
How are you? - What's wrong with me?

106
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:10,173
Nothing. I was worried.

107
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:13,183
Okay, I'll call you later. - Okay.

108
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,713
Listen. - Yeah.

109
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:17,621
I love you. - I love you too, baby.

110
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:23,390
Lover-boy. Ask your wife
to switch on the local news.

111
00:09:24,229 --> 00:09:27,665
Pammi, switch on
the television. - Okay.

112
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:28,631
Just a minute.

113
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:31,398
Sabarwal International school...

114
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:34,233
Oh, my God!

115
00:09:34,606 --> 00:09:35,630
You never told me...

116
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,403
...that your interview's
coming on television.

117
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:39,171
Oh, so exciting.

118
00:09:39,244 --> 00:09:40,176
I've to tell my friends, okay.

119
00:09:40,245 --> 00:09:41,610
Okay, bye.

120
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:46,175
Rascals. What's this nonsense?

121
00:09:46,251 --> 00:09:47,377
Come out. I'm throwing down my gun.

122
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:52,790
Fine, we'll stop this nonsense.

123
00:09:53,325 --> 00:09:55,418
You can ask your wife to check again.

124
00:09:56,428 --> 00:09:58,726
What do you want? - 500 million.

125
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,157
500 million? - In cash.

126
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:04,234
I don't have that kind of money.

127
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:08,672
You rob the parents
in the name of education.

128
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:11,039
And now you say you
don't have the money.

129
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:15,446
You guys must have made
around 700-800 million...

130
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:17,311
...with admissions
and donations alone.

131
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:19,078
We're only asking for 500.

132
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:21,750
Please believe me.

133
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:27,382
I might have around
150 to 200 million, in cash.

134
00:10:28,293 --> 00:10:30,420
300 million, final. - Look...

135
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:32,487
That's a small price
for Sabarwal's reputation.

136
00:10:32,564 --> 00:10:33,394
Yeah.

137
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,096
And, the admissions
are still going on now.

138
00:10:36,368 --> 00:10:38,029
This scandal can cost you dearly.

139
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:43,271
What's the guarantee
that you won't make copies?

140
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:46,709
Mister. You think we're
selling you water-pump...

141
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,406
...that you're demanding guarantee.

142
00:10:48,847 --> 00:10:50,178
We aren't putting a
bullet through your head.

143
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:51,443
Consider that a guarantee.

144
00:10:56,121 --> 00:11:00,148
Fine. When and where do
you want the money delivered?

145
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:03,785
Come to Hyder Kholi,
Chandni Chowk by 1 pm.

146
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,493
And wait for our call.

147
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:09,124
You think Rs.2000 is a measly amount.

148
00:11:09,768 --> 00:11:10,757
Tell me.

149
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:14,033
Forgive me, sir.

150
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:16,402
It was a mistake.

151
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,574
Your existence is
the biggest mistake.

152
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,648
Fool!

153
00:11:25,717 --> 00:11:26,775
Take a look, Mr. Sethi.

154
00:11:27,786 --> 00:11:29,686
He's apologising
after losing Rs.2000.

155
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:32,451
You know what it's worth
when you try to earn it.

156
00:11:34,893 --> 00:11:36,258
So, what brought you here?

157
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:39,828
I...

158
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:43,667
Actually, I...

159
00:11:43,735 --> 00:11:46,727
You didn't visit the
school for a long time.

160
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:51,140
So, I just wanted to
make sure everything's fine.

161
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:53,373
What's wrong with me?

162
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:57,043
The Yoga teacher in school...

163
00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:59,484
...has made me fit.

164
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,477
Everything's okay.

165
00:12:12,831 --> 00:12:13,593
Hello.

166
00:12:13,665 --> 00:12:15,599
Not a rupee less, understand?

167
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:18,659
Who are you, madam...
- I'll do the talking.

168
00:12:19,471 --> 00:12:21,803
And, listen carefully,
I am not going to repeat it. - Yes.

169
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:26,105
Keep the bag of money
at Bashir Miya's shop...

170
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:27,702
...which is exactly
opposite Nandu bread-maker.

171
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,305
Yes.

172
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:31,406
Then go to Nandu's shop and say...

173
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:35,278
..."Three radish stuffed bread,
with extra butter".

174
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:36,753
That's your codeword.

175
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:38,653
Say that, and he'll give you the PSP.

176
00:12:43,862 --> 00:12:45,159
What's my account?

177
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:47,361
The total's 460.

178
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:50,393
Give me another box and a betel leaf.

179
00:12:51,136 --> 00:12:52,501
The total then comes to 500.

180
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:00,677
Yes, mister.
What do you want? - Nothing.

181
00:13:01,146 --> 00:13:04,274
Nandu Bread-maker...
- That's the one. Right there.

182
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,348
That one? - Yes.

183
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:13,217
Come one, come all.

184
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,691
'Aalu Paratha,
Gobi Paratha, Paneer Paratha'.

185
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,749
Pour me some more gravy, son.

186
00:13:15,827 --> 00:13:17,658
Aunt, do you want
to bathe in the gravy?

187
00:13:17,729 --> 00:13:19,253
There you go, aunt.
- That's not your problem, son.

188
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:20,992
'Aalu Paratha, Gobi Paratha.

189
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:24,200
Yes, mister 'Aalu Paratha,
Gobi Paratha, Paneer Paratha'.

190
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:30,598
Three Muli Paratha's
with extra butter. - Okay.

191
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:34,442
Three Muli Paratha's... and
extra butter...

192
00:13:35,113 --> 00:13:36,444
Smeared or poured?

193
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,818
Smeared. - Okay.

194
00:13:41,286 --> 00:13:45,245
Smeared with extra butter.
- Some more gravy, son.

195
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,519
Here you go, aunt.

196
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,662
What's this?

197
00:13:51,563 --> 00:13:53,656
Rascal. What's this nonsense?

198
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:54,289
Quiet.

199
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:55,799
What's going on? - Quiet.

200
00:13:55,867 --> 00:13:57,095
Where's my tape?

201
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,568
Let go my collar.

202
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:01,299
I was told whoever orders
three Muli Parathas...

203
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:03,603
...smeared with extra butter,
give this calculator to him.

204
00:14:03,675 --> 00:14:04,733
That's what I did.

205
00:14:07,212 --> 00:14:08,645
Oh no!

206
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:29,097
Move back! Move back! Move back!

207
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:30,134
Move back!

208
00:14:36,241 --> 00:14:37,765
What's your name? - Bashir Miya.

209
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,202
What's wrong, sir?

210
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:43,646
Bomb! Bomb! Bomb! Bomb!

211
00:14:43,715 --> 00:14:45,580
Did you find the bag?
- We've found the bag.

212
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:46,640
Where?

213
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:49,584
Next to Bashir Miya Paan
Centre at Chandni Chowk.

214
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:51,020
Yes, it's a black bag.

215
00:14:54,192 --> 00:14:55,216
Move back!

216
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:56,261
Move back!

217
00:14:57,729 --> 00:15:03,497
Bomb! Bomb! Bomb! Bomb!

218
00:15:03,568 --> 00:15:05,035
Bomb!

219
00:15:09,107 --> 00:15:10,165
Who are you?

220
00:15:10,575 --> 00:15:12,099
I am the principal.

221
00:15:13,578 --> 00:15:15,239
School? - Yes.

222
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,107
Principal sir, please move back.

223
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:20,310
Let the police do their job.

224
00:15:20,385 --> 00:15:22,353
Move back.

225
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,217
Move back.

226
00:15:23,288 --> 00:15:25,483
Two more bags found
in the middle of the road.

227
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,160
Please repeat the location.

228
00:15:29,227 --> 00:15:31,787
Mid chowki,
we've found two more bags here.

229
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,122
It's a serial bombing matter.

230
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:35,325
We'll be right there, over.

231
00:15:36,234 --> 00:15:37,462
Harbat.

232
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:42,333
Move.

233
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:48,004
Bomb! Bomb!

234
00:15:56,688 --> 00:15:58,451
Take the car at the back.

235
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:09,724
Hello. - Hello.

236
00:16:10,435 --> 00:16:11,959
Are you Jasveer Baweja.

237
00:16:13,071 --> 00:16:14,163
Yes.

238
00:16:14,706 --> 00:16:16,298
Where's your son Sukhwinder.

239
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:20,004
He's gone out for
some important work.

240
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:22,373
Please, come in.

241
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:27,083
What are you two doing here?

242
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,517
Did you diffuse the bomb on the road?

243
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:30,220
The bomb's exploding in here.

244
00:16:30,288 --> 00:16:32,381
This suit's hot like an oven.

245
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:35,191
My leg's completely cooked.

246
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:36,425
Take a look.

247
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,689
Food's the only thing on your mind.

248
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:38,787
Take a look yourself.

249
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:40,695
You should've seen the
look on the principal's face.

250
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:42,758
He couldn't understand...

251
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:44,729
...why the police's
taking his 300 million?

252
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,733
Whose plan was it after all?

253
00:16:48,206 --> 00:16:50,436
Ballu the great,
with my aunt's blessings.

254
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:54,275
By the way, did you take
a course in acting as well?

255
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,541
You see,
when your life's on the line...

256
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:58,674
...the worst actor can
give the best performance.

257
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,718
Don't worry, brother. I am there.

258
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:04,714
The 'Biryani's' ready.
Please taste it.

259
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:05,950
The one for tonight? - Yes.

260
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:09,253
The rice is not
completely cooked. - Okay.

261
00:17:09,327 --> 00:17:11,352
Let it steam for another
15 minutes. - Okay.

262
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,330
Leave that here, I'll finish it.

263
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:21,366
Let it be,
you don't need to take the trouble.

264
00:17:31,516 --> 00:17:34,144
Look... - My son, Sukhi.

265
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:37,087
And they are his friends. - Hello.

266
00:17:37,622 --> 00:17:39,556
Hello, sir. - Hello. Hello.

267
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:41,581
I'm getting a call.

268
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,292
Jeet.

269
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:48,765
Here's your treasure.

270
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:52,192
You see, aunt.

271
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:54,070
He installs the connections...

272
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,740
...and makes us hold
the set-top boxes.

273
00:17:58,477 --> 00:17:59,569
Hold it.

274
00:18:02,113 --> 00:18:03,273
Goodbye. - Bye.

275
00:18:03,548 --> 00:18:04,947
See you again. - Okay.

276
00:18:08,753 --> 00:18:10,118
Sukhi.

277
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,488
Mintu, what a twist.

278
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,319
We're in a big mess.

279
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:20,063
70 people have filed
a case against us.

280
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:22,566
If we don't return them their money...

281
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,067
...our house will be auctioned.

282
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:25,598
They can't auction our house.

283
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,035
Who do they think they are?

284
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:30,265
Sukhi.

285
00:18:31,576 --> 00:18:33,669
It was an order for a grand wedding.

286
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:36,343
The food was so delicious,
I brought it for you.

287
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:38,206
The mince-meat's
really tasty. - Yeah.

288
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,618
Kailash kept stirring
it for two hours.

289
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,513
You know.
It's still a little uncooked.

290
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:47,657
Should've let it cook some more.

291
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:49,524
Nonsense.

292
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:54,525
Thank God!
We were successful in our plan.

293
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,565
And it was a big victory too.

294
00:18:57,202 --> 00:19:00,399
We got the money,
and video evidence against Sethi.

295
00:19:01,139 --> 00:19:04,472
After all, who made the film?
- The film's yet to be made, son.

296
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:09,379
We just managed
to sum-up 300 million.

297
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:12,607
We need 1.2 billion more.

298
00:19:14,152 --> 00:19:15,380
Think.

299
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:36,430
I know you don't like this.

300
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:40,205
If you were alive,
you wouldn't have let us do this.

301
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:46,643
Remember, you would always
catch me cheating in rummy.

302
00:19:48,653 --> 00:19:49,984
But, Mr. Baweja...

303
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,586
...some mess can be cleaned
only by crooked ways.

304
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:56,617
We don't have another choice.

305
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,722
Ravinder Baweja's
an asset for our bank.

306
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,994
He's our pride.

307
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:04,326
Mr. Baweja.

308
00:20:05,136 --> 00:20:07,434
On this occasion,
I would like to say that...

309
00:20:07,505 --> 00:20:10,338
...I want this bank to be for
the middle-class, and common man.

310
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:13,405
Where they can keep
their money safe...

311
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:15,070
...and earn good profit.

312
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:17,173
Thank you.

313
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:19,311
Sir, according to this scheme...

314
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:23,744
...how can we give 15% for
three months of cash deposit?

315
00:20:24,255 --> 00:20:26,519
Don't worry about the interest.

316
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:30,750
Try to lock as many people
you can in this scheme.

317
00:20:31,229 --> 00:20:34,357
What if someone wants
to pay by cheque?

318
00:20:34,432 --> 00:20:37,663
No, Saira. This scheme's
for the lower-income group.

319
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,601
And, most of their income's in cash.

320
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:40,797
This is why Mr. Sabharwal's opened...

321
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:43,836
...a separate title
account for this scheme.

322
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:46,508
And, you two are
the signing authorities.

323
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,274
Here you go, Mr. Baweja.

324
00:20:49,347 --> 00:20:51,645
I had a small flat in Dwarka.

325
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:55,450
I sold that and brought
900,000 for you,

326
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,152
These are some of my savings.

327
00:20:58,456 --> 00:20:59,684
Take these.

328
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:00,750
The scheme certificate.

329
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:03,550
Saira Madam.
What can be a bigger assurance...

330
00:21:03,628 --> 00:21:05,425
...than Mr. Baweja himself.

331
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,297
The scheme's doing really well.

332
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,767
Mr. Gupta,
these are the investor's money.

333
00:21:16,374 --> 00:21:18,308
Tally them and keep them safely.

334
00:21:20,745 --> 00:21:24,181
So, what were you up
to till 4 am in the morning?

335
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:26,046
Nothing. I've nothing to do.

336
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:28,178
Is this the time to come home?

337
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:30,221
If only you had approved my loan...

338
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,214
...I would've come home on time.

339
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:35,081
You're drunk. Go on.

340
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,560
Get some sleep.
- No, I want to say this.

341
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:39,788
If he had approved my loan...

342
00:21:39,864 --> 00:21:42,799
...I wouldn't be installing
cable-connections in Dariyaganj,

343
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:46,593
I'll hang you by those
cables wires. Useless.

344
00:21:46,871 --> 00:21:48,395
Drunkard.

345
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,134
I will. I will drink every day.

346
00:21:50,508 --> 00:21:51,839
I don't want to do this job anymore.

347
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,677
You can do anything you like.

348
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:55,645
But don't ever come back
to this house drunk again.

349
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:58,808
Fine, I'm leaving Delhi. - Stop, son.

350
00:21:58,883 --> 00:22:00,544
Don't go. Sukhi.

351
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:02,345
You had to say it.

352
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,785
Sukhi. My son.

353
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:05,083
He'll be back soon.

354
00:22:05,156 --> 00:22:06,521
She's pampered him too much.

355
00:22:08,426 --> 00:22:10,121
Hello, uncle. Hello, aunty,

356
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:11,321
Diwali's here.

357
00:22:13,064 --> 00:22:13,689
Come.

358
00:22:14,432 --> 00:22:15,160
Happy Diwali.

359
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:17,098
Don't eat all of them.

360
00:22:17,368 --> 00:22:18,630
Happy Diwali. - Happy Diwali.

361
00:22:18,703 --> 00:22:20,364
Happy Diwali. - Happy Diwali.

362
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,236
Come, sit,

363
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:24,506
Aunt.

364
00:22:26,344 --> 00:22:29,541
Happy Diwali. - Bless you.

365
00:22:30,381 --> 00:22:32,178
She's made my Diwali sad.

366
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:36,314
She's been upset since Sukhi left.

367
00:22:36,387 --> 00:22:37,547
Sukhi will be back soon.

368
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:39,617
He's not left home
for the first time.

369
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,491
It's been five months.

370
00:22:44,295 --> 00:22:45,353
Will we get our money or not?

371
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,294
We want to know.

372
00:22:46,831 --> 00:22:49,197
Mr. Baweja,
what should I do with this?

373
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:50,825
It's been five months.

374
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:52,802
When will we get our money?

375
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:55,038
Mr. Chadda, please calm down. - Why?

376
00:22:55,406 --> 00:22:58,204
The bank will return everyone's
money, with interest.

377
00:22:58,276 --> 00:23:00,107
No, no, no...

378
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:02,579
We don't want any interest.

379
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:04,478
We just want our money back.

380
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,346
Has the cat got your tongue?

381
00:23:06,417 --> 00:23:07,577
Just tell us...

382
00:23:08,686 --> 00:23:11,154
Sir, you're handing
us over to the police.

383
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:15,682
We deposited 1.5 billion
of the investors...

384
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,318
...in the title account,
on your orders.

385
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:20,262
What money? What title account?

386
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:23,200
What are you saying, Mr. Baweja?

387
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:25,666
Mr. Gupta,
why don't you say something?

388
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:28,197
You know I gave you the money.

389
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:29,365
Yes, Mr. Gupta. Go on.

390
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,499
Sir, he didn't give me any money.

391
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,271
Sir, they are lying. - What?

392
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:37,208
Baweja. Fraud,
cheating with the bank.

393
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:39,677
I've been serving
this bank for 30 years,

394
00:23:40,718 --> 00:23:42,515
You know my honesty... - Shut up!

395
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:44,780
You can say whatever you
want at the police station.

396
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:46,357
Take them away.

397
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,453
Come on. - Listen to us, sir...

398
00:23:48,526 --> 00:23:49,424
Come on.

399
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:12,276
What's going on here?

400
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,442
Why are you making a racket?

401
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:16,186
Mr. Sabharwal. Hello, sir,

402
00:24:16,554 --> 00:24:21,082
My employees Baweja and
Saira swindled your money.

403
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:22,285
You won't get them back...

404
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,691
...by making a racket in the bank.

405
00:24:23,761 --> 00:24:27,197
I want you to go and lodge
an FIR against them at the station.

406
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:27,754
But, still...

407
00:24:27,832 --> 00:24:30,266
Our money...

408
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,000
Quiet!

409
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:38,532
Come on. Leave.

410
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:53,486
Who's going to return our money now?
- Yeah, Who?

411
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:55,753
The bank has washed their
hands from this matter.

412
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:56,725
Right.

413
00:24:56,794 --> 00:24:58,386
Where's our money?

414
00:24:58,463 --> 00:24:59,725
They can't just disappear.

415
00:24:59,797 --> 00:25:04,097
My name's Chadda.
- Look. There he is.

416
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:05,668
Here comes the thief's son.

417
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:07,534
Okay. - Let him come.

418
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,364
We'll make him pay. - Right.

419
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,768
We gave him our hard earned money.

420
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:15,076
They can't take our money.

421
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:55,344
I am sure, Mr. Baweja.

422
00:25:57,388 --> 00:25:59,356
You didn't do anything wrong.

423
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:06,691
Mom, I want to say something.

424
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:10,334
I never said this before...

425
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:13,298
...how much I loved him.

426
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:17,400
I know he always yelled at me.

427
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:21,341
But, I always respected
his principals.

428
00:26:23,414 --> 00:26:28,215
By God, we'll clear his reputation.

429
00:26:35,793 --> 00:26:40,492
Cheers for marriage,
health and wealth. - Cheers.

430
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:45,764
I've made the best
arrangements for the wedding.

431
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:48,635
Mr. Sabharwal,
I feel that's expected.

432
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:52,138
You see, today's television star...

433
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:55,207
...and the future film star,
that's my son Aman.

434
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,075
Right?

435
00:26:56,147 --> 00:27:01,210
Mr. Sabharwal,
I feel like you've found a gem.

436
00:27:02,086 --> 00:27:04,646
Do you see the ethics
I imbibed in him?

437
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:09,354
I asked him to get married,
and he said yes instantly.

438
00:27:09,427 --> 00:27:14,091
You see, he has 2000 friend
requests pending on Facebook.

439
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:15,154
And, from girls.

440
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,567
But you see, brother.

441
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:19,398
I will fulfill my promise.

442
00:27:20,204 --> 00:27:21,603
Reception, in Taj Mumbai.

443
00:27:21,672 --> 00:27:23,037
Honeymoon in Europe.

444
00:27:23,107 --> 00:27:26,565
And, 1.5 billion, they're all ready.

445
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:28,171
You've just one daughter.

446
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:30,680
You're bound to do that much, right?

447
00:27:30,748 --> 00:27:31,510
Yes.

448
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,174
You're right.

449
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:36,277
Once daughter's married...

450
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,454
...then, I've a few
more responsibilities.

451
00:27:39,857 --> 00:27:41,085
Once they're dealt with...

452
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:44,121
...life will be really peaceful.

453
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:47,722
Sabharwal, don't worry.

454
00:27:48,232 --> 00:27:50,132
We still have a long way to go?

455
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:51,759
Which way? Shall I get the car?

456
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,104
Why don't you explain him?

457
00:27:55,506 --> 00:27:57,406
Try to understand what I am saying.

458
00:27:57,475 --> 00:27:58,635
You didn't hear what I said.

459
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:01,703
You see, I am trying to say...

460
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,205
...once my sister becomes
the cabinet minister...

461
00:28:04,715 --> 00:28:05,704
...then, just watch.

462
00:28:06,517 --> 00:28:09,611
I'll get that bank
case dismissed completely.

463
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:11,646
As far as your files are concerned.

464
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:14,488
I'll get them cleared in a snap.

465
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:21,995
You... made me so
happy by saying that.

466
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:23,698
Really...

467
00:28:23,768 --> 00:28:25,736
On that note, he'll tell you a joke.

468
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,560
Go on.

469
00:28:27,638 --> 00:28:31,597
Sir, which one?

470
00:28:32,176 --> 00:28:35,202
Just tell him a joke. - Yes.

471
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:37,703
Message...

472
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:40,648
Boyfriend to his girlfriend.

473
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:44,014
Sweety, come home in the evening,

474
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:45,656
There'll be no one.

475
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:48,055
Sweety comes home in the evening.

476
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:51,022
And, there's no one there.

477
00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:55,996
There's...

478
00:28:57,535 --> 00:28:58,433
That's the joke.

479
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,602
What a joke...

480
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:08,078
Yes, it's true. That's nothing.

481
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:09,344
There's more.

482
00:29:09,413 --> 00:29:10,437
Stop it, Aman.

483
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,648
I am going to die laughing,

484
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:16,151
You will really get
along with papa. - I see.

485
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,051
You've got a wicked sense of humour.

486
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:22,250
But, you had this innocent
look on the reality show.

487
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:24,059
You see, baby.

488
00:29:24,328 --> 00:29:27,991
That was Aman's strategies
to win the reality show.

489
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:30,193
It's called 'Mind Games' sweetheart.

490
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,064
'Mind Games.'

491
00:29:31,135 --> 00:29:32,727
'Mind Games! '

492
00:29:34,672 --> 00:29:37,197
You smoke? - Of course.

493
00:29:38,342 --> 00:29:40,207
When Aman's happy, he smokes.

494
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:44,339
But, aren't you doing an
anti-smoking campaign on television?

495
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,641
Image, baby. Image.

496
00:29:47,718 --> 00:29:48,685
One has to do it.

497
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:50,645
And anyway, I charge for it.

498
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:54,791
You charge for it?
- Of course. I'm a celebrity.

499
00:29:58,629 --> 00:30:02,156
Wow! Now, that is hot.

500
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,569
Stop leaching. - I am not leaching...

501
00:30:07,471 --> 00:30:08,995
I'm just admiring the beauty.

502
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:12,736
What's the time?
- Are you getting late?

503
00:30:14,478 --> 00:30:16,275
Yeah! It's time to hit the gym.

504
00:30:17,281 --> 00:30:18,305
Come.

505
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:29,823
What? - The cable rent.

506
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:33,493
You charge full rent,
but always show half movie.

507
00:30:33,564 --> 00:30:35,225
The rest of it is wasted in ads.

508
00:30:35,299 --> 00:30:37,699
So, we don't make them at home.
- Yes, you do.

509
00:30:38,769 --> 00:30:41,101
Do you see her attitude?
- Always complaining.

510
00:30:44,508 --> 00:30:45,270
Here you go.

511
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:46,542
Get lost.

512
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:47,600
No need to come next month.

513
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:51,104
They think they own us
along with the connection.

514
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:55,252
Sukhi. - Hello.

515
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:56,286
Hello.

516
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,652
You don't show English
movies at night.

517
00:30:59,857 --> 00:31:03,088
Okay, we'll show one
at the weekend. - Okay.

518
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:05,261
You've really grown up.

519
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:13,566
These beggars don't have
a connection. - Hold on, Sukhi.

520
00:31:21,879 --> 00:31:25,371
They're watching C.I.D.
mom's favourite serial.

521
00:31:27,818 --> 00:31:28,807
What the...

522
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,815
They're stealing our connection.

523
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:36,317
Wait.

524
00:31:37,561 --> 00:31:39,620
Who are you?
- No need to get personal.

525
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:41,164
Sukhi, from Jasbeer Cable.

526
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:43,361
We don't want a connection.

527
00:31:44,268 --> 00:31:45,633
Don't you see that doorbell?

528
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:46,567
Why were you pounding on the door?

529
00:31:46,637 --> 00:31:47,797
This is just the beginning.

530
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:49,271
What's going on inside?

531
00:31:49,907 --> 00:31:51,568
'Chikni Chameli's dancing.'

532
00:31:51,642 --> 00:31:52,666
Do you have a problem?

533
00:31:52,743 --> 00:31:54,506
I know you're watching CID.

534
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,372
I can have you jailed
for illegal cable connection.

535
00:31:57,448 --> 00:31:58,380
Where are you going?

536
00:31:58,449 --> 00:31:59,677
Stop. Stop.

537
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,149
You don't own it.

538
00:32:01,218 --> 00:32:02,276
Let's settle it over something,

539
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:04,150
Corruption's in your blood.

540
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:07,117
We're decent people.
- We're no thieves either.

541
00:32:10,127 --> 00:32:11,594
So, you are watching CID. - Yes.

542
00:32:11,662 --> 00:32:12,492
Preeto, move aside.

543
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:13,757
Let me watch CID.

544
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:17,460
Who are you?
- Sukhi, from Jasbeer Cable.

545
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:20,531
Preeto. Move aside.
The criminal's about to be caught.

546
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:22,396
You can watch the repeat.

547
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:23,531
They've a lot of those.

548
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,673
First, how long have you
been watching cable for free?

549
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:30,112
Since they tried to kill
Daya for the first time.

550
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:30,772
Move aside.

551
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,446
Attack on Daya... - Five months.

552
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:35,046
Sorry. We've been watching
since five months.

553
00:32:35,419 --> 00:32:38,286
Rs. 1000 for the connection...

554
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:41,291
...and 250 a month,
adds up to Rs.2250.

555
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:43,455
Are you going to pay
here or at the police station?

556
00:32:44,428 --> 00:32:45,656
How about a concession?

557
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:48,298
We can't give you any concession.

558
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:51,028
You will have to pay 2250.

559
00:32:51,535 --> 00:32:53,059
We make an honest living.

560
00:32:53,537 --> 00:32:56,335
We still have honest
people amongst us.

561
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:08,144
I've only 150.

562
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:10,577
I'll adjust the 100
in next month's rent.

563
00:33:11,222 --> 00:33:13,281
Sukhi from Jasbeer Cable.

564
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:16,252
Tomorrow if you close shop,
we'll lose 100 rupees.

565
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:19,195
Fine, I'll have it sent tomorrow.

566
00:33:20,097 --> 00:33:23,191
We won't close down
business for 100 rupees.

567
00:33:27,371 --> 00:33:28,565
Send the rest tomorrow.

568
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:32,207
What else do you want?

569
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:36,402
Let's go. What are you looking at?

570
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:47,552
You haven't finished
your second drink yet.

571
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:48,614
I already finished my third.

572
00:33:48,692 --> 00:33:49,784
What's wrong with you?
- Make me another.

573
00:33:50,694 --> 00:33:51,661
By the way...

574
00:33:52,129 --> 00:33:54,256
You know that milk factory job?

575
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:57,097
I've stationed Kabootar there.

576
00:33:57,401 --> 00:33:58,265
Its done?

577
00:33:58,602 --> 00:34:00,593
You're the best
'Make-shifter' in this world.

578
00:34:32,102 --> 00:34:33,729
No! I've told you many times.

579
00:34:34,071 --> 00:34:37,507
Come after 10 am.
- It's Sukhwinder Baweja.

580
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:41,038
Cable-guy.

581
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:44,780
Did you stand out
here all night? - No.

582
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:46,377
I couldn't sleep all night.

583
00:34:47,084 --> 00:34:49,143
I had to refund your 100 rupees.

584
00:34:49,453 --> 00:34:52,752
And, my mom says loan
is the biggest burden.

585
00:34:55,125 --> 00:34:58,356
Fine. Then,
lighten your burden. - Yeah.

586
00:35:12,676 --> 00:35:16,237
Sorry. I've only 50.

587
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,375
I think I lost the remaining 50.

588
00:35:19,483 --> 00:35:21,144
Can I pay you later?

589
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:24,310
Yes. Of course.

590
00:35:24,588 --> 00:35:26,681
But, don't stay up all night.

591
00:35:34,498 --> 00:35:37,228
What now? - I found 20 more.

592
00:35:38,068 --> 00:35:39,365
It was in the secret pocket.

593
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:51,081
What's this about?
- I've got 10 more.

594
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:08,362
This time... I've 500.

595
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:13,236
Can we go watch the
morning show in Saket?

596
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:29,218
"It's the age of love."

597
00:36:29,286 --> 00:36:31,083
"Girl, you're soft like butter."

598
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:33,555
"I'm bound to lose my heart."

599
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:43,726
"It's the age of love."

600
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:45,564
"Girl, you're soft like butter."

601
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:48,196
"I'm bound to lose my heart."

602
00:36:49,306 --> 00:36:52,798
"My eyes clicked when I saw you."

603
00:36:52,876 --> 00:36:55,572
"Your image's posted on my heart."

604
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:03,448
"My heart's...
filled with only your images."

605
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,421
"Dance with me."

606
00:37:07,224 --> 00:37:11,251
"Give me a dose of your love."

607
00:37:11,328 --> 00:37:13,057
"It's the age of love."

608
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,722
"Girl, you're soft like butter."

609
00:37:14,798 --> 00:37:17,528
"I'm bound to lose my heart."

610
00:37:18,535 --> 00:37:22,198
"My eyes clicked when I saw you."

611
00:37:22,272 --> 00:37:26,436
"Your image's posted on my heart."

612
00:37:41,225 --> 00:37:44,786
"Your eyes spell black magic."

613
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:47,990
"You've made me lose control."

614
00:37:56,073 --> 00:37:59,474
"Your eyes spell black magic."

615
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:03,138
"You've made me lose control."

616
00:38:03,213 --> 00:38:06,671
"Come, let me take
you around the world."

617
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:10,151
"Say yes,
and we'll fly away on a holiday."

618
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,265
"It's the age of love."

619
00:38:26,336 --> 00:38:27,769
"Girl, you're soft like butter."

620
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:30,573
"I'm bound to lose my heart."

621
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:35,339
"My eyes clicked when I saw you."

622
00:38:35,412 --> 00:38:38,040
"Your image's posted on my heart."

623
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:49,417
One, two, three, four...
five... six... seven... eight and again

624
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:52,189
Hey Shilpi!

625
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:54,294
Hi. - Hi.

626
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,756
Guys, give me a moment?
- How are you?

627
00:38:57,067 --> 00:38:57,533
I'm fine.

628
00:38:57,601 --> 00:39:00,468
I wanted a favour from you,
meet sukhi.

629
00:39:00,537 --> 00:39:01,469
Nice to meet you.

630
00:39:01,538 --> 00:39:03,165
Heard a lot about you.

631
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:06,170
Do you teach here?
- No. I am a student.

632
00:39:06,543 --> 00:39:08,443
Sir, the lights have been installed.

633
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:10,137
The stage is set.

634
00:39:10,547 --> 00:39:12,276
And, I've put up
five huge generators.

635
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,115
And, the dancer.

636
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:15,517
Let's talk to her right now.

637
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:17,451
One... Two... Three...

638
00:39:20,057 --> 00:39:22,150
Hello. - Hello, Ms. Shilpi.

639
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,022
This is...

640
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:26,586
Sudhir Bagga. - Yes, Mr. Bagga.

641
00:39:26,663 --> 00:39:31,066
You are coming,
to teach dancing in the wedding.

642
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:33,626
I am so sorry,
but it's not possible for me at all.

643
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:37,536
But you said you will.
- Right, I did say I will.

644
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:40,270
But, a personal problem
has come up. - What?

645
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:44,410
But, don't worry I'll send
you a replacement. - I see,

646
00:39:44,481 --> 00:39:45,607
She's a very good dancer...

647
00:39:45,682 --> 00:39:48,583
...and, her charges are
lower than mine. - Thank you.

648
00:39:48,652 --> 00:39:50,017
Bye. Bye.

649
00:39:53,323 --> 00:39:54,153
It's done.

650
00:39:54,224 --> 00:39:55,623
You did one good thing, Bagga.

651
00:39:56,326 --> 00:39:59,318
And one, two, three, four...

652
00:39:59,396 --> 00:40:01,523
One, two, three, four...

653
00:40:01,598 --> 00:40:03,759
One, two...

654
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:06,701
Hi, dad. - My doll.

655
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:09,534
What's going on? - Meet Manpreet,
our new choreographer.

656
00:40:09,606 --> 00:40:11,096
By the way, she's fantastic.

657
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:12,642
Hello. - Hi, sir.

658
00:40:12,709 --> 00:40:14,643
Ms. Shilpi's sent you, right? - Yes.

659
00:40:15,312 --> 00:40:17,337
You've to really do your best.

660
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:19,649
After all,
it's my daughter's wedding.

661
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:20,777
Definitely, sir.

662
00:40:21,451 --> 00:40:24,249
Sir, if you don't mind,
can I say something? - Of course.

663
00:40:24,321 --> 00:40:25,720
You don't look like Gudiya's dad.

664
00:40:25,789 --> 00:40:27,484
You've maintained yourself so well.

665
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:28,725
You don't know, dad.

666
00:40:28,792 --> 00:40:31,260
He does power Yoga every
morning one hour. - Wow.

667
00:40:31,528 --> 00:40:32,586
Thank you.

668
00:40:32,663 --> 00:40:34,790
You two can continue, we'll leave.
- See you, sir.

669
00:40:35,165 --> 00:40:36,097
Bye. - Bye.

670
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:38,233
Okay, again? - Yes.

671
00:40:38,302 --> 00:40:40,065
So and yes...

672
00:40:45,375 --> 00:40:46,740
Bye. - Bye.

673
00:40:52,516 --> 00:40:53,414
Preet.

674
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,248
Thanks.

675
00:40:57,721 --> 00:41:01,282
Without you...
- No need to say anything.

676
00:41:01,658 --> 00:41:05,788
But, without you...
- I did this for myself, not you.

677
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:08,527
What? - You won't get it.

678
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,296
But really,
if you ever have a problem...

679
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:13,336
Why are you getting sentimental?

680
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:17,766
Do one thing, get my granny
free life-time cable TV.

681
00:41:17,841 --> 00:41:19,468
Then we're even.

682
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:22,170
What?

683
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:23,338
Do you want to get me
emotional and get a kiss?

684
00:41:23,413 --> 00:41:25,040
Get lost? - Bye.

685
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:41,698
Thanks.

686
00:41:42,699 --> 00:41:45,293
That Manpreet's a great girl. - Why?

687
00:41:46,203 --> 00:41:47,363
We couldn't come up with an idea...

688
00:41:47,871 --> 00:41:50,169
...and she managed to
get in Sabharwal's home.

689
00:41:51,408 --> 00:41:54,104
Wait and watch,
she'll set things right.

690
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:55,639
Then ask her to do everything.

691
00:41:55,712 --> 00:41:56,679
What are you doing here?

692
00:41:57,614 --> 00:41:59,411
Why? Jealous?

693
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,153
Brother-in-law?

694
00:42:05,222 --> 00:42:09,488
Tell us which is real? - Rascals.

695
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:12,354
You're drinking beer,
and offering me milk.

696
00:42:14,231 --> 00:42:17,530
Brother-in-law,
just taste it. Please.

697
00:42:17,834 --> 00:42:20,667
Oh, God! That's too much.

698
00:42:20,737 --> 00:42:23,137
Brother-in-law, drink the milk.

699
00:42:23,473 --> 00:42:24,565
Bagga.

700
00:42:24,641 --> 00:42:26,404
Is it 'Naag Panchami' today?

701
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:30,713
Sir. Milk is good for health.

702
00:42:31,148 --> 00:42:32,513
I see. Good for health?

703
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:35,516
So, get healthy.
Come on. - No, no, no.

704
00:42:35,585 --> 00:42:38,179
Milk doesn't suit me. - Bagga.

705
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:40,151
Pick up the glass.

706
00:42:42,759 --> 00:42:44,021
Try the first one.

707
00:42:50,467 --> 00:42:51,695
This is real.

708
00:42:53,236 --> 00:42:54,669
No! - No!

709
00:42:59,543 --> 00:43:00,737
This is real.

710
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:03,442
No! - No!

711
00:43:03,513 --> 00:43:05,140
The third one.

712
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:14,349
This is real. - Absolutely not.

713
00:43:14,424 --> 00:43:17,052
Brother-in-law, all of them are fake.

714
00:43:21,431 --> 00:43:25,492
Amazing. The cream's absolutely real.

715
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:28,163
We've stumbled upon
an amazing chemical.

716
00:43:28,238 --> 00:43:32,470
Not just cream, but milk,
butter, butter-milk, all A-1.

717
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:37,570
We'll produce the milk,
and you can take the cream.

718
00:43:37,647 --> 00:43:38,511
And, the real one.

719
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:44,344
Now, we don't have to mix
fake products with the real ones.

720
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:46,355
We'll now supply them
completely fake products.

721
00:43:46,423 --> 00:43:50,291
We need to make the first
delivery in three days.

722
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:53,420
After that,
we'll be rolling in money.

723
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:56,295
And, swimming in cash.

724
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,268
And you know,
they keep their money in the fridge.

725
00:44:00,704 --> 00:44:01,728
What the...

726
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:04,101
If they keep the
money in the fridge...

727
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:05,539
...where do they keep the curd?

728
00:44:06,309 --> 00:44:07,537
So, let's make things sour for them...

729
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:09,339
...with cream on top.

730
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:13,375
"Play on."

731
00:44:13,683 --> 00:44:17,483
"Play on."

732
00:44:33,437 --> 00:44:36,668
Madam. Madam. - Who is it?

733
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:38,664
Ministry of Health and Food...

734
00:44:38,742 --> 00:44:40,004
Our madam.

735
00:44:40,877 --> 00:44:43,141
We'll have to seal
your dairy. - You...

736
00:44:43,213 --> 00:44:46,512
We've information that
you make adulterated milk here.

737
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:48,574
And, you're drinking
liquor here as well.

738
00:44:49,086 --> 00:44:49,814
No shame at all.

739
00:44:50,153 --> 00:44:51,586
Get up. Get up. - Get up.

740
00:44:51,655 --> 00:44:52,622
Where's the processing unit?

741
00:44:52,689 --> 00:44:53,314
Come on.

742
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:55,153
Inspector Chaudhary,
start the proceedings...

743
00:44:55,225 --> 00:44:56,419
...and seize their licence.

744
00:44:56,493 --> 00:44:57,391
Madam, listen...

745
00:44:57,461 --> 00:44:58,393
Let's go... - Madam...

746
00:44:58,462 --> 00:44:59,486
Open the door.

747
00:44:59,796 --> 00:45:00,387
Where are you going?

748
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:02,659
So, Milkman, show me your licence.

749
00:45:02,732 --> 00:45:05,394
Adulteration with milk.
- Milk, without a cow.

750
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:08,195
Rascal.

751
00:45:08,271 --> 00:45:09,636
Take a picture.

752
00:45:15,278 --> 00:45:19,612
Sir. Can I make a call?

753
00:45:24,688 --> 00:45:27,156
I see.

754
00:45:27,858 --> 00:45:31,350
'Praise be to Lord Shiva! '

755
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:39,632
'Praise be to Lord Shiva! '

756
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:42,270
Yes. - Brother-in-law,
there's a problem.

757
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:43,499
There's been a raid at the dairy.

758
00:45:44,674 --> 00:45:47,074
Don't know, some lady officer.

759
00:45:47,377 --> 00:45:49,208
Handle the situation at any cost.

760
00:45:49,279 --> 00:45:53,306
If Gudiya's father-in-law finds out,
he'll cancel the wedding.

761
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:56,313
Get the cash out of the dairy.

762
00:45:56,386 --> 00:45:58,752
And, send that dairy to Jenny.

763
00:45:58,822 --> 00:46:00,255
Tell her that I sent her a gift.

764
00:46:00,323 --> 00:46:02,348
But, ask her not to open
it as long as I don't get there.

765
00:46:02,425 --> 00:46:04,120
Tell her I'll be
at her place tonight.

766
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,430
Are you Mr. Sabharwal's
brother-in-law?

767
00:46:12,502 --> 00:46:15,335
First cousin from mother's side.

768
00:46:15,405 --> 00:46:17,396
Oh Mother... - What happened?

769
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:21,635
Don't complain about this
to your brother-in-law. - I see.

770
00:46:22,612 --> 00:46:24,204
It won't affect this madam.

771
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:26,249
But, your brother
will have me sacked.

772
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:29,041
Look, please help me out.

773
00:46:29,853 --> 00:46:31,218
You can take this out, if you want.

774
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:36,016
If you want to save your job...

775
00:46:36,526 --> 00:46:39,586
...then, you'll have
to save us from your madam.

776
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:41,720
My madam? - Yes.

777
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:43,463
Shall I get rid of her?

778
00:46:46,503 --> 00:46:50,599
I'll have to bribe everyone.
- Just do it.

779
00:46:50,674 --> 00:46:56,442
Just get our fridge out
of this factory. - I see.

780
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:58,645
Let's see.

781
00:46:58,715 --> 00:47:00,080
You'll get the job done?

782
00:47:00,383 --> 00:47:01,350
Sure?

783
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:04,153
Yes, sir. Jai Hind!

784
00:47:04,554 --> 00:47:06,579
Inspector Chaudhary,
the commissioner's...

785
00:47:06,656 --> 00:47:07,680
...summoned me urgently.

786
00:47:07,757 --> 00:47:10,225
Continue your proceedings here,
and keep reporting to me.

787
00:47:10,594 --> 00:47:11,526
Raman, what's wrong with you?

788
00:47:11,595 --> 00:47:13,495
Is this filled with milk or alcohol?

789
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:21,399
Here you go, sir. That's one million.

790
00:47:23,206 --> 00:47:25,572
Listen to me carefully. - Yes.

791
00:47:25,642 --> 00:47:29,305
Only one of you will
go with the fridge. - Fine.

792
00:47:29,379 --> 00:47:32,371
And, he'll go along with you.

793
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:33,711
No problem.

794
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:37,749
Jenny must feel it's a gift,
that's what brother-in-law said.

795
00:47:37,821 --> 00:47:40,187
When will we send a gift to Jenny?

796
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:42,054
Only when brother-in-law let's go.

797
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:45,555
Here. Give this to
Jenny on my behalf. - Fine.

798
00:47:45,629 --> 00:47:46,789
Let's go.

799
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:48,186
Come on.

800
00:47:48,265 --> 00:47:50,199
Careful. Don't worry. - Okay.

801
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:51,359
All the best.

802
00:48:10,553 --> 00:48:12,521
Jenny. - Raman?

803
00:48:13,723 --> 00:48:14,747
Hi, Jenny.

804
00:48:15,325 --> 00:48:17,293
This is brother-in-law's
gift for you.

805
00:48:18,094 --> 00:48:20,153
This is from my side.

806
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:22,130
Oops. Sorry.

807
00:48:22,198 --> 00:48:23,256
Thank you.

808
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:25,597
Fridge? But, I already have a fridge.

809
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:27,637
No, no, there's a big surprise.

810
00:48:27,704 --> 00:48:28,398
Surprise?

811
00:48:28,471 --> 00:48:30,302
Brother-in-law will tell you later.

812
00:48:30,774 --> 00:48:32,071
He'll come at night.

813
00:48:32,442 --> 00:48:33,500
Please don't open.

814
00:48:34,744 --> 00:48:37,110
Hello, lady. Myself Jogi.

815
00:48:37,514 --> 00:48:41,280
How's your day? - Hi. I am okay.

816
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:43,344
Shall we go, sir?

817
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:53,354
Hello, lady. Jogi again.

818
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:54,419
Remember.

819
00:48:54,864 --> 00:48:57,196
Actually, we gave you
the wrong fridge.

820
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:00,492
So, we've got you
the new fridge. Look.

821
00:49:02,706 --> 00:49:05,197
This has more features.

822
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:07,004
Colour. Wonderful.

823
00:49:08,311 --> 00:49:10,211
Hi. - Who are you?

824
00:49:10,814 --> 00:49:12,543
I... am Jogi.

825
00:49:12,615 --> 00:49:16,107
Aren't you Mr. Sabharwal? - Yes.

826
00:49:16,419 --> 00:49:20,583
Mr. Sabharwal!
You've two factories. I know it.

827
00:49:20,657 --> 00:49:22,750
You've many other factories.

828
00:49:22,826 --> 00:49:25,158
You have schools, bungalows. Right?

829
00:49:25,228 --> 00:49:26,217
Hold on, I am getting a call.

830
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:28,059
I get nervous.

831
00:49:28,598 --> 00:49:32,398
Hello. I'm with Mr. Sabharwal.

832
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:34,630
I'll be right there. Okay?

833
00:49:34,704 --> 00:49:36,228
Of course. We'll definitely meet.

834
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:39,639
Who was he? - Raman came with
the fridge, so he was with him.

835
00:49:39,709 --> 00:49:43,406
And, those two guys are exchanging
the fridge right now.

836
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,277
I never ordered any replacement.

837
00:49:45,615 --> 00:49:47,480
Who is it?
- They're there in the kitchen?

838
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:48,710
Where?

839
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,117
Who is it?

840
00:49:52,188 --> 00:49:53,212
Hey!

841
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:56,387
Close the door.

842
00:49:59,229 --> 00:50:00,389
Hey!

843
00:50:00,463 --> 00:50:01,589
Open the door.

844
00:50:09,706 --> 00:50:10,764
Thank God!

845
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:17,079
Brother-in-law!

846
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:18,447
Yes.

847
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:20,813
Rascals. I would've lost 500 million
because of you.

848
00:50:20,884 --> 00:50:25,048
I've delivered your fridge,
with balloon.

849
00:50:25,422 --> 00:50:27,185
Shut up! Balloons!

850
00:50:28,091 --> 00:50:30,787
The raid on the dairy was a fake.
- What? Fake?

851
00:50:31,094 --> 00:50:32,083
Find out who they were?

852
00:50:33,897 --> 00:50:36,331
No wonder Sood left so soon.

853
00:50:36,399 --> 00:50:37,423
What's happening?

854
00:50:44,808 --> 00:50:45,832
Yes.

855
00:50:46,676 --> 00:50:47,768
Yes.

856
00:50:49,412 --> 00:50:51,846
But... the money's safe.

857
00:50:52,148 --> 00:50:53,615
But, what's happening with me?

858
00:50:53,683 --> 00:50:55,241
You're going through a bad phase.

859
00:50:56,252 --> 00:50:58,083
The planets are not in your favour.

860
00:50:58,588 --> 00:51:01,022
Do something, please.

861
00:51:01,524 --> 00:51:04,459
Stay quiet until Gudiya's marriage.

862
00:51:04,527 --> 00:51:05,687
The wedding day's auspicious.

863
00:51:05,762 --> 00:51:09,562
Arrange for a feast and donation
to 101 Brahmins before the marriage.

864
00:51:10,066 --> 00:51:11,590
You'll be rid of all
problem's, Sabharwal.

865
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:13,458
Okay.

866
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:25,806
Mom, I did tell him that...

867
00:51:25,882 --> 00:51:28,146
...you trust that Manpreet too much.

868
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:31,253
Mintu was right there. Ask him.

869
00:51:31,321 --> 00:51:32,788
Ballu, shut up.

870
00:51:33,756 --> 00:51:35,314
I wonder how Sabharwal
turned up there.

871
00:51:35,391 --> 00:51:36,653
Otherwise, we would've
finished the job.

872
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,591
What do you mean how?

873
00:51:39,162 --> 00:51:40,754
Whose job was it to keep
an eye on him?

874
00:51:41,498 --> 00:51:43,398
She was given just one job.

875
00:51:43,466 --> 00:51:44,558
But, she couldn't do that either.

876
00:51:44,634 --> 00:51:45,794
Let's forget what happened?

877
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:48,531
At least we got our hands
on 1.5 million.

878
00:51:49,339 --> 00:51:51,830
You can use that to buy stuff
for your catering business.

879
00:51:51,908 --> 00:51:53,466
That's what it's good for.

880
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:55,543
And him, lover boy.

881
00:51:56,312 --> 00:51:57,836
"She'll set things right."

882
00:51:57,914 --> 00:51:59,279
Do you see now?

883
00:51:59,782 --> 00:52:02,410
I say chuck Manpreet out
of this plan.

884
00:52:02,685 --> 00:52:04,346
Why chuck her out?

885
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:06,285
Calm down! Calm down!

886
00:52:07,056 --> 00:52:09,217
We need to think what next?

887
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:10,156
What else?

888
00:52:10,226 --> 00:52:11,989
I'll round up some boys.

889
00:52:12,362 --> 00:52:14,091
We'll rob the rascal at gunpoint.

890
00:52:14,163 --> 00:52:15,061
No abusing here.

891
00:52:15,131 --> 00:52:17,156
Are you crazy? - Why?

892
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:19,668
Because, we aren't
professional dacoits.

893
00:52:19,736 --> 00:52:21,431
Taking our own money is not stealing.

894
00:52:21,504 --> 00:52:22,596
Like this?

895
00:52:22,672 --> 00:52:24,799
And, what if we're jailed after this.

896
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:26,302
Who is going to explain him that?

897
00:52:26,376 --> 00:52:29,368
Okay, then you can do whatever
you think is right.

898
00:52:29,445 --> 00:52:30,377
I am going.

899
00:52:30,446 --> 00:52:32,243
Ballu. Stop, son. - Bye!

900
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:33,339
Ballu.

901
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,082
Inspector Valli called today.

902
00:52:38,154 --> 00:52:39,678
The investors are after our lives.

903
00:52:40,223 --> 00:52:42,555
If we don't return them our money...

904
00:52:42,859 --> 00:52:44,793
...then we'll all be
out on the streets.

905
00:52:45,428 --> 00:52:50,422
Nonsense!

906
00:52:57,642 --> 00:52:58,574
Look.

907
00:53:00,679 --> 00:53:01,668
Don't worry.

908
00:53:03,081 --> 00:53:04,070
Everything will be fine.

909
00:53:08,286 --> 00:53:10,584
I'm only worried about aunt.

910
00:53:12,557 --> 00:53:14,457
Look after her, please.

911
00:53:17,195 --> 00:53:20,653
And, you too.

912
00:53:29,007 --> 00:53:30,634
Saira.

913
00:53:34,045 --> 00:53:35,706
I'll get you out of here soon.

914
00:53:47,659 --> 00:53:49,354
You two only find faults with me.

915
00:53:50,628 --> 00:53:52,220
What about Sukhi,
who's ruining the entire plan...

916
00:53:52,297 --> 00:53:53,594
...for the sake of love?

917
00:53:56,434 --> 00:53:58,129
No point in fighting
amongst ourselves, Ballu.

918
00:53:59,104 --> 00:54:00,867
We'll be on the losing end.

919
00:54:03,441 --> 00:54:04,601
The court has issued orders.

920
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:07,407
If we don't repay them in two weeks...

921
00:54:08,246 --> 00:54:09,873
...aunt loses everything.

922
00:54:17,956 --> 00:54:19,321
We're in a big mess.

923
00:54:19,624 --> 00:54:20,921
Don't worry, mom.

924
00:54:21,292 --> 00:54:23,260
Mintu will show me
how to crack the safes.

925
00:54:23,328 --> 00:54:26,388
You don't understand.
Ballu has to be with you.

926
00:54:27,065 --> 00:54:31,399
He won't take a second
to crack Sabharwal's safe.

927
00:54:32,037 --> 00:54:33,527
Yeah, we did have an argument.

928
00:54:34,139 --> 00:54:36,630
Stop fighting. Bow down.

929
00:55:11,409 --> 00:55:13,400
Ballu's calling.

930
00:55:14,112 --> 00:55:18,014
Hello. - Hello, aunt.
Balwant speaking.

931
00:55:18,083 --> 00:55:18,913
Hello, son.

932
00:55:19,184 --> 00:55:22,244
Pardon me, I walked out
in a fit of rage that day.

933
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:23,885
But, don't worry.

934
00:55:24,155 --> 00:55:25,122
We will win in the end.

935
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:28,057
Ballu. I was just talking
to Sukhi about you.

936
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:31,493
Look, you two shouldn't
argue amongst yourselves.

937
00:55:32,163 --> 00:55:33,960
After all you're brothers.

938
00:55:34,365 --> 00:55:37,357
I just prayed for everyone
at the 'Gurdwara'.

939
00:55:37,435 --> 00:55:40,563
Why don't you ask the
Lord to join our team as well?

940
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:42,529
All our problems will be cleared.

941
00:55:44,576 --> 00:55:45,543
Right, son.

942
00:55:46,144 --> 00:55:47,202
Listen. - Yes.

943
00:55:47,545 --> 00:55:49,570
Come home in the evening.
- Okay, see you.

944
00:55:49,647 --> 00:55:51,137
Bye, son. - Bye.

945
00:55:51,616 --> 00:55:54,107
Ballu's agreed.
He's coming home in the evening.

946
00:55:54,686 --> 00:55:56,347
Let's go, son.

947
00:56:19,244 --> 00:56:20,040
Okay, everyone.

948
00:56:20,311 --> 00:56:22,074
Five, six, seven, eight start...

949
00:56:26,518 --> 00:56:30,113
"He's hiding... behind her glares."

950
00:56:30,455 --> 00:56:32,218
"Sometimes peers from above."

951
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:34,281
"Or spies from below."

952
00:56:34,993 --> 00:56:38,690
"He's hiding... behind her glares."

953
00:56:38,763 --> 00:56:40,697
"Sometimes peers from above."

954
00:56:40,765 --> 00:56:42,630
"Or spies from below."

955
00:56:42,967 --> 00:56:47,267
"Steals my heart."

956
00:56:47,672 --> 00:56:51,699
"Steals my heart."

957
00:56:52,043 --> 00:56:56,070
"With an arrogant style."

958
00:56:56,147 --> 00:56:59,173
"Your mischievous eyes."

959
00:57:00,218 --> 00:57:03,654
"Your mischievous eyes."

960
00:57:03,721 --> 00:57:04,915
Papa.

961
00:57:06,591 --> 00:57:08,388
Look at papa.

962
00:57:09,127 --> 00:57:10,617
Papa, you're looking so funny.

963
00:57:11,095 --> 00:57:13,154
Uncle, try to feel the
words and beats of the song.

964
00:57:13,464 --> 00:57:15,261
That's what I'm trying to do.

965
00:57:15,333 --> 00:57:17,597
Am I doing it fine?
- You're better than Malaika.

966
00:57:17,669 --> 00:57:18,966
I was talking about uncle.

967
00:57:19,304 --> 00:57:20,236
It's very simple.

968
00:57:20,505 --> 00:57:21,494
Give me your hands.

969
00:57:22,006 --> 00:57:24,406
Back, back, now come ahead.

970
00:57:24,475 --> 00:57:25,635
Yes.

971
00:57:25,710 --> 00:57:28,042
Papa. This looks like gym class.

972
00:57:28,613 --> 00:57:31,480
Manpreet,
can you give papa some simple steps?

973
00:57:31,549 --> 00:57:32,914
You shut up, dear.

974
00:57:33,218 --> 00:57:37,177
Manpreet's popular in Delhi.
she is fantastic - I know.

975
00:57:37,255 --> 00:57:40,281
Just watch, she'll turn me into
Hrithik before the cocktail party.

976
00:57:40,358 --> 00:57:41,450
Hrithik.

977
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,292
Gudiya, I think you're
making him conscious.

978
00:57:44,362 --> 00:57:46,592
You just go, I'll help him practise.
- Alright. I'll go.

979
00:57:46,664 --> 00:57:48,427
I'm famished anyways. - Thank you.

980
00:57:48,499 --> 00:57:49,488
Let's go.

981
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:52,092
Ma'am, shall we stay here.
- No, take them outside.

982
00:57:52,170 --> 00:57:53,535
Help them rehearse. - Yes.

983
00:57:54,939 --> 00:57:56,998
You know, uncle. You're too stiff.

984
00:57:57,075 --> 00:57:58,565
Just loosen up.

985
00:57:58,643 --> 00:57:59,610
Loosen up.

986
00:58:01,012 --> 00:58:03,606
You need to practise
hard to dance like Hrithik.

987
00:58:03,681 --> 00:58:06,172
I can dance all night if you like?

988
00:58:07,185 --> 00:58:09,210
Do you have the stamina,
uncle? - Try.

989
00:58:10,221 --> 00:58:11,950
But, don't call me uncle.

990
00:58:12,357 --> 00:58:14,382
Call me, Mohan. - Okay, Mohan.

991
00:58:14,959 --> 00:58:17,450
Shall I play the music? - Yes.

992
00:58:21,499 --> 00:58:22,966
Sir.

993
00:58:23,735 --> 00:58:25,100
The food's served.

994
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:28,595
Gudiya's saying if
you could join her...

995
00:58:29,607 --> 00:58:31,336
No?

996
00:58:31,943 --> 00:58:33,342
Manpreet, let's eat.

997
00:58:34,145 --> 00:58:36,204
Carry on, Mohan. I'll join you.

998
00:58:36,281 --> 00:58:38,078
Waiting.

999
00:58:39,651 --> 00:58:42,381
Don't... you understand
I'm rehearsing.

1000
00:58:44,989 --> 00:58:47,389
Bagga. The kebabs... - Right.

1001
00:58:47,759 --> 00:58:50,455
Superb. - Isn't it?

1002
00:58:53,498 --> 00:58:55,056
Hello, ma'am.

1003
00:58:56,668 --> 00:58:58,932
Strange.

1004
00:59:08,413 --> 00:59:10,005
Hello.

1005
00:59:10,081 --> 00:59:11,514
The dress really suits you.

1006
00:59:11,582 --> 00:59:13,311
You're looking nice.

1007
00:59:13,651 --> 00:59:17,451
Amazing, our tastes are so similar.

1008
00:59:17,522 --> 00:59:18,511
You're having salad, so am I.

1009
00:59:18,589 --> 00:59:20,557
I believe in eating light... - Mohan.

1010
00:59:21,025 --> 00:59:23,289
I believe you can eat all you want.

1011
00:59:23,628 --> 00:59:24,595
But exercise double.

1012
00:59:24,996 --> 00:59:26,190
That's what Salman says as well.

1013
00:59:26,264 --> 00:59:27,993
Oh, Salman says that. - Yes.

1014
00:59:28,066 --> 00:59:30,534
Then, we must have soup
and starters along with it.

1015
00:59:30,601 --> 00:59:31,932
Hey... - Mohan.

1016
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:33,362
I don't want to sound rude.

1017
00:59:33,971 --> 00:59:35,529
But your arrangements are so classy...

1018
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:38,101
...but, the food's so middle-class.

1019
00:59:38,643 --> 00:59:40,304
So, the salad.

1020
00:59:40,712 --> 00:59:43,442
I think... you should
arrange for something better.

1021
00:59:44,048 --> 00:59:44,514
I hope you didn't make
the same arrangements...

1022
00:59:44,582 --> 00:59:45,947
...for the marriage and reception.

1023
00:59:47,985 --> 00:59:50,078
Bagga. - Sir.

1024
00:59:51,356 --> 00:59:52,050
Yes, sir.

1025
00:59:52,123 --> 00:59:54,387
With whose permission
did you make this arrangement?

1026
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:56,952
Were the caterers your relatives?

1027
00:59:57,228 --> 00:59:58,490
Who did you ask?

1028
00:59:58,563 --> 01:00:02,260
Sir, you approved ten items...
after that it was a go ahead.

1029
01:00:03,468 --> 01:00:04,298
I... - So...

1030
01:00:04,569 --> 01:00:05,934
Don't argue, Bagga.

1031
01:00:06,404 --> 01:00:08,133
Manpreet says the food's rubbish.

1032
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:10,967
Rubbish. - Mohan.

1033
01:00:11,042 --> 01:00:13,533
According to your class and style...

1034
01:00:13,911 --> 01:00:16,175
...I think you should try
Modern Caterers and Decorators.

1035
01:00:16,581 --> 01:00:18,515
Remember the wedding,
of the Diwan's? - Yes.

1036
01:00:18,583 --> 01:00:19,515
They handled the catering there.

1037
01:00:19,584 --> 01:00:20,846
I was the main choreographer there.

1038
01:00:21,152 --> 01:00:23,017
The food was so tasty,
and so expensive, oh God.

1039
01:00:23,488 --> 01:00:24,250
I see.

1040
01:00:24,322 --> 01:00:28,019
Bagga. Call Modern Caterers.

1041
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:31,620
Sir, what about the
commitment you made to them.

1042
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:35,299
Manpreet's saying it.
So, it's final Bagga.

1043
01:00:36,701 --> 01:00:37,224
Address?

1044
01:00:37,301 --> 01:00:39,496
Find it, Bagga... - Dictionary?

1045
01:00:39,570 --> 01:00:41,367
Yes, go.

1046
01:00:43,574 --> 01:00:48,568
Do you need salt in the salad?
- Do I need salt?

1047
01:00:54,952 --> 01:00:56,078
Hold on, I'll find out.

1048
01:00:56,154 --> 01:00:57,280
Sir, it's the Agriculture
Minister on line.

1049
01:00:58,423 --> 01:00:59,822
Yes.

1050
01:01:00,324 --> 01:01:01,450
No, no, we're heavily packed.

1051
01:01:02,059 --> 01:01:03,185
Not a chance.

1052
01:01:03,261 --> 01:01:06,628
We can't cancel our prior
commitments for the Minister.

1053
01:01:11,068 --> 01:01:12,228
Yes?

1054
01:01:12,603 --> 01:01:15,367
I am Bagga.

1055
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,439
On behalf of Mr. Sabharwal's...

1056
01:01:19,177 --> 01:01:21,202
His daughter's getting married.

1057
01:01:22,613 --> 01:01:24,012
So, I need to discuss
the catering order.

1058
01:01:25,450 --> 01:01:26,439
Who's the boss?

1059
01:01:29,053 --> 01:01:30,645
Obviously, me.

1060
01:01:32,156 --> 01:01:33,180
Good.

1061
01:01:33,257 --> 01:01:37,921
So, Mr. Sabharwal's
a renowned industrialist.

1062
01:01:38,563 --> 01:01:41,930
Her daughter's getting
married to that boy...

1063
01:01:42,266 --> 01:01:45,360
...serial superstar, Aman Kapoor.

1064
01:01:46,003 --> 01:01:47,095
The boy's family demands...

1065
01:01:48,639 --> 01:01:51,369
...they want only Modern Caterers.

1066
01:01:53,311 --> 01:01:54,039
I said, it'll be done.

1067
01:01:54,345 --> 01:01:55,835
And, here I am.

1068
01:01:56,347 --> 01:01:57,814
Was I right?

1069
01:02:00,518 --> 01:02:02,213
What's he saying?

1070
01:02:02,286 --> 01:02:04,015
Seems like a genuine client.

1071
01:02:04,088 --> 01:02:05,555
And, he's got a strong
reference as well.

1072
01:02:06,257 --> 01:02:07,519
I think we should do it.

1073
01:02:08,259 --> 01:02:09,453
Thank you very much.

1074
01:02:09,527 --> 01:02:12,087
If it wasn't for you, things
would've gotten difficult for me.

1075
01:02:12,363 --> 01:02:14,297
That's okay. You're a genuine guy.

1076
01:02:15,066 --> 01:02:16,966
And, you're paying double. - Right.

1077
01:02:17,401 --> 01:02:19,130
We've to look after you as well.

1078
01:02:20,004 --> 01:02:21,437
I had a question.

1079
01:02:21,506 --> 01:02:24,031
That small boy looks
after your business.

1080
01:02:24,442 --> 01:02:25,500
He's our younger brother.

1081
01:02:26,077 --> 01:02:28,602
10 years ago, mom found
him crying outside the bungalow.

1082
01:02:29,447 --> 01:02:30,345
She brought him home.

1083
01:02:30,915 --> 01:02:34,112
He's very lucky for the business.
- Oh my God.

1084
01:02:34,519 --> 01:02:37,317
You made an orphan your brother.

1085
01:02:37,688 --> 01:02:40,452
He's no orphan,
he means more than a brother.

1086
01:02:41,025 --> 01:02:43,585
Sorry for hurting your feelings.

1087
01:02:45,062 --> 01:02:48,429
Very few people respect others.

1088
01:02:58,409 --> 01:03:03,403
"Play on."

1089
01:03:05,650 --> 01:03:11,111
"Play on."

1090
01:03:13,324 --> 01:03:14,586
Modern Caterers and Decorators.

1091
01:03:14,659 --> 01:03:15,626
Quality and Quantity.

1092
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:16,683
We offer the best.

1093
01:03:17,061 --> 01:03:18,119
Since summer of '69.

1094
01:03:18,396 --> 01:03:19,590
Good.

1095
01:03:20,097 --> 01:03:22,463
Bagga. That's called class.

1096
01:03:22,533 --> 01:03:24,501
Five star service right at home.

1097
01:03:24,569 --> 01:03:25,558
Yes.

1098
01:03:25,636 --> 01:03:27,399
Thanks, Bagga. - My pleasure, sir.

1099
01:03:28,039 --> 01:03:29,904
Tell Manpreet about this. - Yes.

1100
01:03:31,175 --> 01:03:33,370
Wonderful, teacher...

1101
01:03:33,444 --> 01:03:36,038
You're making Sabharwal
dance to your tunes.

1102
01:03:36,647 --> 01:03:38,137
Right, Ballu.

1103
01:03:38,215 --> 01:03:40,046
Yeah. She's a dance
teacher after all.

1104
01:03:40,585 --> 01:03:42,109
You would know better.

1105
01:03:42,987 --> 01:03:45,148
But, I shouldn't have
been on the team, right Sukhi.

1106
01:03:46,223 --> 01:03:49,192
No. You see,
Ballu's always short-tempered.

1107
01:03:49,727 --> 01:03:52,924
Forgive and forget.
- Hey. Don't ruin things for me.

1108
01:03:53,331 --> 01:03:56,323
If Sabharwal gets a whiff,
it'll spoil our plan.

1109
01:03:57,335 --> 01:03:59,030
Stay away from each other.

1110
01:03:59,437 --> 01:04:00,597
Stay away.

1111
01:04:05,509 --> 01:04:09,468
"He's hiding... behind her glares."

1112
01:04:09,547 --> 01:04:13,142
Sometimes peers from
above." "Or spies from below."

1113
01:04:13,217 --> 01:04:14,684
Don't worry, Mr. Bagga.

1114
01:04:15,252 --> 01:04:17,117
Ballu's made arrangements
for the dais...

1115
01:04:17,188 --> 01:04:19,179
...decoration and conveyance. - I see.

1116
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:20,657
There's nothing other
than that, right?

1117
01:04:20,725 --> 01:04:22,215
I was really worried.

1118
01:04:22,493 --> 01:04:23,653
But, with you around
I've nothing to worry.

1119
01:04:23,728 --> 01:04:25,628
You can forget all your worries.

1120
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:28,691
Get up. - Oh no...

1121
01:04:29,734 --> 01:04:31,361
Sorry, sir. - It's okay.

1122
01:04:31,435 --> 01:04:32,561
Everyone makes mistakes.

1123
01:04:33,170 --> 01:04:36,162
And anyway, the kebabs are cold.

1124
01:04:36,707 --> 01:04:38,698
You should always serve
hot fresh kebabs to the guest.

1125
01:04:39,443 --> 01:04:39,704
I'm sorry, sir.

1126
01:04:40,044 --> 01:04:42,535
Get fresh kebabs from the oven.
- Sorry, sir.

1127
01:04:45,149 --> 01:04:47,709
Wow! That's amazing, brother.

1128
01:04:48,619 --> 01:04:51,554
You treat your staff so nicely.

1129
01:04:52,256 --> 01:04:55,020
Mr. Bagga, the staff is
the foundation of our business.

1130
01:04:55,092 --> 01:04:56,184
Not the boss.

1131
01:04:56,994 --> 01:05:00,555
And, if we don't respect them,
they'll spoil our business.

1132
01:05:00,631 --> 01:05:01,290
Great.

1133
01:05:01,365 --> 01:05:03,560
And, there's something
called humanity.

1134
01:05:04,502 --> 01:05:05,594
Great.

1135
01:05:06,637 --> 01:05:07,968
Really, great.

1136
01:05:08,039 --> 01:05:11,634
"She's hot-headed,
and she's having a tiff with me."

1137
01:05:12,143 --> 01:05:15,635
"She's insane, and in a bad mood."

1138
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:20,239
"She's hot-headed,
and she's having a tiff with me."

1139
01:05:20,685 --> 01:05:25,054
"She's insane, and in a bad mood."

1140
01:05:25,122 --> 01:05:28,649
"She's hot-headed,
and she's having a tiff with me."

1141
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:32,491
"She's hot-headed,
and she's having a tiff with me."

1142
01:05:32,563 --> 01:05:34,360
"Loves to have an affair."

1143
01:05:34,632 --> 01:05:36,623
"Tries to convince me."

1144
01:05:36,701 --> 01:05:38,464
"Loves to have an affair."

1145
01:05:38,736 --> 01:05:41,034
"Tries to convince me."

1146
01:05:41,972 --> 01:05:45,703
"Teases me slowly-slowly."

1147
01:05:46,077 --> 01:05:48,545
"Your mischievous eyes."

1148
01:05:50,247 --> 01:05:53,512
"Your mischievous eyes."

1149
01:05:54,318 --> 01:05:57,344
"Your mischievous eyes."

1150
01:05:58,456 --> 01:06:01,425
"Your mischievous eyes."

1151
01:06:01,492 --> 01:06:03,392
Wow, Mohan. What a performance.

1152
01:06:03,461 --> 01:06:05,452
I am impressed. - All because of you.

1153
01:06:05,529 --> 01:06:07,622
First of all,
your suggestion Modern Caterers...

1154
01:06:07,698 --> 01:06:10,428
...saved my reputation,
their food was simply delicious.

1155
01:06:10,501 --> 01:06:12,992
And, the way you made me dance.

1156
01:06:13,070 --> 01:06:16,938
I mean, the entire party...
- Anything for you.

1157
01:06:18,309 --> 01:06:19,867
I think you're getting late.

1158
01:06:20,177 --> 01:06:20,666
Bagga.

1159
01:06:21,011 --> 01:06:22,376
Bagga. - Sir.

1160
01:06:23,114 --> 01:06:25,548
Sir. - Drop madam home.

1161
01:06:25,616 --> 01:06:26,344
Of course.

1162
01:06:26,617 --> 01:06:27,515
Madam, just two minutes.

1163
01:06:28,052 --> 01:06:29,246
There's chaos at the parking space.

1164
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:31,481
I'll just deal with
that and be right back.

1165
01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:34,623
Are you mad?

1166
01:06:34,959 --> 01:06:36,654
Will you decide what
you're going to do?

1167
01:06:37,027 --> 01:06:38,221
Who's your boss?

1168
01:06:38,562 --> 01:06:39,654
Who's your boss?

1169
01:06:39,730 --> 01:06:41,095
It's my order.

1170
01:06:41,165 --> 01:06:42,928
Say yes. - Yes.

1171
01:06:43,234 --> 01:06:44,326
You will drop her.

1172
01:06:44,401 --> 01:06:46,528
Say yes. - Yes.

1173
01:06:47,037 --> 01:06:50,234
What happened, papa? - Nothing.

1174
01:06:51,375 --> 01:06:52,933
Okay.

1175
01:06:53,577 --> 01:06:54,942
Yes, madam. Please.

1176
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:58,910
He's in a bad mood.

1177
01:07:00,184 --> 01:07:03,347
Bro, what can a poor servant
do when the boss yells at him?

1178
01:07:05,422 --> 01:07:07,447
Don't worry, I'll drop her.

1179
01:07:07,525 --> 01:07:08,617
I'll drop her. - I... I...

1180
01:07:08,692 --> 01:07:10,284
Just relax. I'll drop her.

1181
01:07:10,361 --> 01:07:12,261
Come. Come with me. - Thank you.

1182
01:07:13,030 --> 01:07:16,158
Bagga. Bagga. - Yes.

1183
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:21,537
Don't mind but, such small
things often happen in a party.

1184
01:07:24,375 --> 01:07:25,307
Come on.

1185
01:07:25,376 --> 01:07:28,072
How about a lovely-lovely...
for a change of mood?

1186
01:07:30,514 --> 01:07:33,210
Bagga. Have one more.

1187
01:07:35,753 --> 01:07:37,118
Sukhi.

1188
01:07:38,255 --> 01:07:39,483
Sukhi.

1189
01:07:42,626 --> 01:07:44,321
You're like my brother.

1190
01:07:46,497 --> 01:07:49,227
You know how to give respect.

1191
01:07:52,069 --> 01:07:53,969
And then there's that...

1192
01:07:55,573 --> 01:07:57,200
Sabharwal.

1193
01:07:58,909 --> 01:08:02,970
I've been with him since 20 years.

1194
01:08:05,316 --> 01:08:07,443
Forget about respect.

1195
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:15,054
He keeps abusing and
humiliating me all day.

1196
01:08:16,327 --> 01:08:19,057
Relax, bro. You're drunk.

1197
01:08:20,197 --> 01:08:24,497
Sabharwal's the one who's high.

1198
01:08:27,404 --> 01:08:28,962
I said...

1199
01:08:29,707 --> 01:08:35,509
"Please admit my
daughter in your school".

1200
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:39,107
He says...

1201
01:08:40,384 --> 01:08:45,185
"Your daughter won't
become a doctor or engineer"?

1202
01:08:46,123 --> 01:08:50,492
Get her admitted in a public school.

1203
01:08:51,428 --> 01:08:52,588
And be grateful.

1204
01:08:55,599 --> 01:08:59,592
And I was so hurt hearing this...

1205
01:09:00,437 --> 01:09:02,029
I just can't tell you.

1206
01:09:12,149 --> 01:09:13,582
And, then there's you.

1207
01:09:16,253 --> 01:09:21,486
You're showering
that orphan with love.

1208
01:09:21,992 --> 01:09:24,085
Raising him like family.

1209
01:09:27,398 --> 01:09:29,263
God gives everyone a chance.

1210
01:09:30,567 --> 01:09:32,159
You too.

1211
01:09:35,940 --> 01:09:36,599
Out with it.

1212
01:09:44,982 --> 01:09:46,950
This farm house is
more like a fortress.

1213
01:09:47,284 --> 01:09:49,582
I'm tired,
but couldn't find the stash anywhere.

1214
01:09:52,022 --> 01:09:53,080
There's just one place left now.

1215
01:09:53,691 --> 01:09:57,218
His bedroom.
- You didn't check his bedroom yet.

1216
01:09:57,294 --> 01:09:58,522
He doesn't allow anyone in there.

1217
01:10:00,664 --> 01:10:01,596
What now?

1218
01:10:03,701 --> 01:10:05,293
Tomorrow's 'Mata Ki
Chowki' (prayer ceremony).

1219
01:10:06,003 --> 01:10:07,095
That's when I'll get the opportunity.

1220
01:10:08,439 --> 01:10:09,406
Fine. Careful.

1221
01:10:09,673 --> 01:10:11,573
"Hail the Goddess."

1222
01:10:12,009 --> 01:10:15,240
"Glory to the Mother Goddess."

1223
01:10:17,214 --> 01:10:18,613
Wow. It's so amazing.

1224
01:10:18,949 --> 01:10:21,577
See I told you. - And, I told you.

1225
01:10:22,052 --> 01:10:23,280
Don't drink too much.

1226
01:10:23,554 --> 01:10:26,216
If brother-in-law
finds out we're drunk...

1227
01:10:26,557 --> 01:10:28,582
...he won't spare us.

1228
01:10:29,626 --> 01:10:31,924
We can't even walk.

1229
01:10:32,262 --> 01:10:34,492
How can we run?

1230
01:10:36,567 --> 01:10:37,659
Brother-in-law

1231
01:10:37,735 --> 01:10:39,669
Why did you bring her here?
- Brother-in-law!

1232
01:10:39,737 --> 01:10:42,137
She wanted to see Indian culture.

1233
01:10:42,206 --> 01:10:44,640
So we said we'll take
you to 'Mata's Chowki'.

1234
01:10:44,708 --> 01:10:47,506
This way,
we can do things at one time.

1235
01:10:59,223 --> 01:11:00,918
"We're the Goddess's super fans."

1236
01:11:00,991 --> 01:11:02,583
"The One with the
red veil and black eyes."

1237
01:11:02,659 --> 01:11:04,320
"We're dear to the Goddess."

1238
01:11:04,395 --> 01:11:05,885
"We'll serve you day and night."

1239
01:11:09,566 --> 01:11:11,557
"I love You."

1240
01:11:13,037 --> 01:11:15,437
"I sing your praises."

1241
01:11:16,306 --> 01:11:19,605
"O Goddess. - Glory to You."

1242
01:11:19,943 --> 01:11:22,878
"Bless us with Your grace."

1243
01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:25,974
"Give us Your blessings."

1244
01:11:26,050 --> 01:11:26,516
"Glory to You."

1245
01:11:26,583 --> 01:11:29,279
"Alleviate our pain."

1246
01:11:30,020 --> 01:11:32,614
"O Goddess."

1247
01:11:33,524 --> 01:11:36,015
"Bless us with Your grace."

1248
01:11:36,093 --> 01:11:36,422
"Glory to You."

1249
01:11:36,493 --> 01:11:39,553
"Don't let the night pass away.
Don't let this bond break."

1250
01:11:39,630 --> 01:11:42,997
"We'll sit all night at your feet."

1251
01:11:43,067 --> 01:11:44,591
"O Goddess."

1252
01:11:44,668 --> 01:11:47,466
"O Goddess."

1253
01:11:47,538 --> 01:11:50,063
"O Goddess."

1254
01:11:55,112 --> 01:11:56,579
Hurry up, we don't have time.

1255
01:11:58,649 --> 01:12:00,480
It's open.

1256
01:12:02,219 --> 01:12:04,813
"Shower us with wealth."

1257
01:12:05,556 --> 01:12:08,320
"Solve our problems."

1258
01:12:08,926 --> 01:12:12,521
"O Goddess. - Glory to You."

1259
01:12:13,931 --> 01:12:15,626
Come here, take a look.

1260
01:12:17,634 --> 01:12:18,828
Look there.

1261
01:12:19,269 --> 01:12:22,363
"Make this plan perfect."

1262
01:12:22,439 --> 01:12:28,241
"Bless us with Your grace."

1263
01:12:28,912 --> 01:12:32,177
"Don't let the night pass away.
Don't let this bond break."

1264
01:12:32,249 --> 01:12:35,184
"We'll sit all night at your feet."

1265
01:12:35,252 --> 01:12:37,015
"O Goddess."

1266
01:12:37,087 --> 01:12:40,147
"O Goddess."

1267
01:12:40,657 --> 01:12:42,921
"O Goddess."

1268
01:12:43,694 --> 01:12:45,423
Come here. Here.

1269
01:12:45,496 --> 01:12:46,087
It's empty.

1270
01:12:46,163 --> 01:12:47,596
Nothing here.

1271
01:12:49,066 --> 01:12:50,328
Look there. Come on.

1272
01:12:51,268 --> 01:12:52,166
How much?

1273
01:12:53,270 --> 01:12:54,965
I said it once...

1274
01:12:58,442 --> 01:12:59,966
I'm disconnecting.

1275
01:13:01,011 --> 01:13:04,503
Mohan. - You? Here?

1276
01:13:05,282 --> 01:13:11,084
Actually, I had a request. - Yes.

1277
01:13:11,455 --> 01:13:13,423
Not here. - Let's go in the room.

1278
01:13:13,490 --> 01:13:15,253
No, let's go in the balcony.

1279
01:13:15,993 --> 01:13:16,652
Come on. - Yes.

1280
01:13:16,994 --> 01:13:17,551
Come on.

1281
01:13:18,095 --> 01:13:20,620
"Our Benevolent Benefactor."

1282
01:13:20,964 --> 01:13:24,058
"We sing Your praises,
You're truly amazing."

1283
01:13:24,134 --> 01:13:27,626
"We come to Your threshold,
for Your blessings."

1284
01:13:27,704 --> 01:13:30,639
"Your grace is true,
we're your children."

1285
01:13:31,141 --> 01:13:34,201
"Every Saturday,
is an auspicious day for us."

1286
01:13:34,545 --> 01:13:38,504
"Everyone sing with me..."

1287
01:13:38,582 --> 01:13:41,676
"Don't let the night pass
away." "Don't let this bond break."

1288
01:13:42,019 --> 01:13:45,250
"We'll sit all night at your feet."

1289
01:13:45,322 --> 01:13:48,655
"Don't let the night pass
away." "Don't let this bond break."

1290
01:13:48,725 --> 01:13:50,659
Remember my friend Shilpi.

1291
01:13:51,261 --> 01:13:52,626
The one who recommended me.

1292
01:13:53,130 --> 01:13:54,358
Yes.

1293
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:56,456
We're inaugurating our
dance academy day after tomorrow.

1294
01:13:56,934 --> 01:13:57,593
In Kalkaji.

1295
01:13:58,202 --> 01:14:01,365
And, I want you
to be the chief guest.

1296
01:14:02,272 --> 01:14:07,141
Me, chief guest?
- Please. Don't say no.

1297
01:14:08,946 --> 01:14:12,074
If you say so... - Thank you.

1298
01:14:12,149 --> 01:14:14,379
By the way, Manpreet...

1299
01:14:14,451 --> 01:14:17,443
...this dress really suits you. - Oh.

1300
01:14:19,189 --> 01:14:20,315
Sir!

1301
01:14:20,591 --> 01:14:21,683
Come quickly.

1302
01:14:22,125 --> 01:14:24,389
Raman and Pawan are
troubling the lady singer.

1303
01:14:25,162 --> 01:14:26,322
Come quickly.

1304
01:14:26,396 --> 01:14:28,660
If you don't come
Goddess will get angry.

1305
01:14:28,732 --> 01:14:32,429
It's nothing. They're just children,
playing along...

1306
01:14:32,703 --> 01:14:35,171
Wait, I am coming. - Come.

1307
01:14:35,672 --> 01:14:37,469
I'll be right... - Yes.

1308
01:14:39,776 --> 01:14:41,004
Don't you have any manners?

1309
01:14:41,311 --> 01:14:42,573
How could you say that
in front of Manpreet?

1310
01:14:43,046 --> 01:14:45,708
They're troubling the lady openly,
and I can't say it.

1311
01:14:46,083 --> 01:14:47,573
Look.

1312
01:14:48,218 --> 01:14:52,314
Brother-in-law. It's brother-in-law.

1313
01:14:52,389 --> 01:14:55,222
"O Goddess."

1314
01:14:55,292 --> 01:14:59,854
"O Goddess."

1315
01:15:00,998 --> 01:15:02,966
Please do something.

1316
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,431
I know something can be done.

1317
01:15:05,502 --> 01:15:08,994
Look, I know Mr. Baweja
was an honest man.

1318
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:11,304
But, I cannot do anything now.

1319
01:15:11,375 --> 01:15:12,865
The orders are from the court.

1320
01:15:15,178 --> 01:15:17,146
You have only 5 days left.

1321
01:15:18,949 --> 01:15:22,077
Try to convince the investors
to withdraw the case.

1322
01:15:22,152 --> 01:15:25,315
Otherwise, I'll have to do my duty.

1323
01:15:28,025 --> 01:15:29,253
Just a minute.

1324
01:15:31,028 --> 01:15:34,122
Hello. - Aunt. Balwant here.

1325
01:15:34,464 --> 01:15:37,194
There's no money anywhere.

1326
01:15:38,201 --> 01:15:39,964
I don't thing Goddess
is supporting us.

1327
01:15:40,337 --> 01:15:42,237
Now you do something. - Fine.

1328
01:16:10,033 --> 01:16:15,972
"Play on."

1329
01:16:17,407 --> 01:16:23,312
"Play on."

1330
01:16:24,948 --> 01:16:30,909
"Play on."

1331
01:16:43,066 --> 01:16:44,658
Excuse me. - Sir.

1332
01:16:46,370 --> 01:16:47,098
Sir.

1333
01:16:47,170 --> 01:16:49,195
Who's your senior manager?
Call him right now.

1334
01:16:49,272 --> 01:16:50,899
Tell me, sir. I am here for you.

1335
01:16:51,375 --> 01:16:53,400
I ordered for soya
sauce 15 minutes back.

1336
01:16:53,677 --> 01:16:55,144
How do you expect me to eat my sushi?

1337
01:16:55,545 --> 01:16:58,571
Sir, we're expecting
a special guest... - So?

1338
01:17:00,150 --> 01:17:01,378
There she is.

1339
01:17:02,619 --> 01:17:03,984
Hello, ma'am. So pleased to see you.

1340
01:17:04,054 --> 01:17:05,646
As usual,
we've booked the top three floors...

1341
01:17:05,722 --> 01:17:06,654
...of our hotel especially for you.

1342
01:17:06,723 --> 01:17:07,587
Please, come. - Come.

1343
01:17:07,924 --> 01:17:11,360
Hello. Hello, Mrs. Mehta.
Good to see you.

1344
01:17:11,428 --> 01:17:12,360
After a long time.

1345
01:17:12,629 --> 01:17:17,362
Where were you? - I was off to Milan,
for the power project.

1346
01:17:18,268 --> 01:17:19,667
And, how's your party doing?

1347
01:17:20,070 --> 01:17:23,039
It's running on your funds.

1348
01:17:23,106 --> 01:17:25,336
Don't embarrass me,
I trust your party.

1349
01:17:25,409 --> 01:17:26,637
Thank you, ma'am. Thank you.

1350
01:17:27,110 --> 01:17:28,304
Allow me.

1351
01:17:29,579 --> 01:17:30,568
Thank you.

1352
01:17:38,455 --> 01:17:39,547
Excuse me, sir.

1353
01:17:40,557 --> 01:17:41,489
That's the limit.

1354
01:17:41,758 --> 01:17:43,419
I ordered for soya sauce,
what's this?

1355
01:17:43,493 --> 01:17:46,155
Sir, this is a bottle of
rare wine from Mrs. Hansal Mehta.

1356
01:17:46,229 --> 01:17:47,696
Especially for you.

1357
01:17:52,369 --> 01:17:57,363
Mrs. Hansal Mehta. If you don't mind,
can I ask a question?

1358
01:17:58,308 --> 01:17:59,969
What do you do?

1359
01:18:02,312 --> 01:18:05,645
Hansal Constructions.
Hansal Finance. Hansal Shipping.

1360
01:18:06,116 --> 01:18:10,883
Hansal chemicals. Hansal Fisheries.
Hansal Farms. - You mean.

1361
01:18:11,521 --> 01:18:14,183
Hansal Plaza,
Hansal Mall, Hansal Arcade.

1362
01:18:14,925 --> 01:18:17,450
You're well known from
Gurgaon to Delhi to Noida.

1363
01:18:18,128 --> 01:18:19,857
It's my pleasure to meet you, madam.

1364
01:18:20,163 --> 01:18:22,427
Likewise, my pleasure.

1365
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,366
It's great meeting Aman Kapoor,
the big star.

1366
01:18:27,504 --> 01:18:30,667
I wish Sailja was here. - Who?

1367
01:18:31,208 --> 01:18:32,607
My daughter, Sailja. - I see.

1368
01:18:32,943 --> 01:18:34,035
She's a big fan of yours.

1369
01:18:34,444 --> 01:18:37,436
In fact, both my children
are big fan of yours.

1370
01:18:37,981 --> 01:18:40,108
They don't miss a single episode.

1371
01:18:40,183 --> 01:18:42,674
Sailja even records
all your episodes.

1372
01:18:43,019 --> 01:18:44,247
I see.

1373
01:18:46,523 --> 01:18:48,957
So, you're here on a shoot. - No, no.

1374
01:18:49,359 --> 01:18:51,259
Actually, Aman's getting married.

1375
01:18:51,761 --> 01:18:53,319
Mr. Sabharwal's daughter.

1376
01:18:53,396 --> 01:18:54,590
What was her name? - Gudiya.

1377
01:18:54,664 --> 01:18:56,029
Gudiya.

1378
01:18:57,367 --> 01:18:58,994
I'm sure you know him.

1379
01:19:01,371 --> 01:19:04,169
Actually, Mr. Sabharwal
bought the land...

1380
01:19:04,508 --> 01:19:06,169
...for his bank and school
from Hansal Real Estate.

1381
01:19:07,377 --> 01:19:09,004
But, the payment's still due.

1382
01:19:09,713 --> 01:19:12,238
Shut up.
Let's not talk about it. - Sorry.

1383
01:19:14,551 --> 01:19:17,281
Congrats in advance, son.
- Thank you so much.

1384
01:19:19,055 --> 01:19:20,352
Excuse me, ma'am.

1385
01:19:20,423 --> 01:19:21,617
This is the limited edition watch...

1386
01:19:21,958 --> 01:19:23,357
...the one you ordered for your son.

1387
01:19:27,998 --> 01:19:29,295
It's come.

1388
01:19:40,477 --> 01:19:42,570
Wow. That is classy.

1389
01:19:43,246 --> 01:19:46,215
Fabulous. - You like it?

1390
01:19:46,283 --> 01:19:47,181
Keep it.

1391
01:19:47,684 --> 01:19:49,447
Your wedding gift. - No.

1392
01:19:49,519 --> 01:19:50,986
Keep it.

1393
01:19:51,054 --> 01:19:52,612
You shouldn't say no to your elders.

1394
01:19:52,689 --> 01:19:54,486
Take it. She's giving
it with love. Keep it.

1395
01:19:55,158 --> 01:19:57,956
Take it. - Thanks.

1396
01:20:02,065 --> 01:20:06,297
Instead of Mrs. Hansal Mehta,
can I call you aunt... - Stupid.

1397
01:20:06,369 --> 01:20:08,166
She's like your aunt.

1398
01:20:08,238 --> 01:20:09,933
And she has to attend your wedding.

1399
01:20:10,206 --> 01:20:11,434
Otherwise, we won't take this gift.

1400
01:20:11,508 --> 01:20:12,099
Give it back.

1401
01:20:12,175 --> 01:20:13,836
Are you coming, or not?

1402
01:20:20,417 --> 01:20:22,408
Check that.

1403
01:20:26,356 --> 01:20:28,347
Excuse me.
I'll be right back from the restroom.

1404
01:20:28,425 --> 01:20:30,552
Okay. - Be back soon.

1405
01:20:31,294 --> 01:20:32,386
Hello!

1406
01:20:33,096 --> 01:20:35,087
No, no. No, Mr. Sabharwal.

1407
01:20:35,165 --> 01:20:38,464
I've told you so many
times stop calling madam.

1408
01:20:39,402 --> 01:20:41,597
We're not interested in
doing any business with you.

1409
01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:45,240
And, please don't call again.

1410
01:20:59,089 --> 01:21:00,488
Son, what are you doing?

1411
01:21:00,557 --> 01:21:01,489
So many brownies?

1412
01:21:01,558 --> 01:21:03,583
Tell me what's bothering you.
- You know it, dad.

1413
01:21:04,294 --> 01:21:06,262
When Aman's stressed,
Aman eats brownies.

1414
01:21:06,329 --> 01:21:08,092
Yeah, but what's the problem.

1415
01:21:08,164 --> 01:21:10,496
That Sabharwal,
he's a big time fraud.

1416
01:21:11,568 --> 01:21:14,093
And, you brought this proposal.
- Yes, I did.

1417
01:21:14,170 --> 01:21:16,297
You needed 1.5 billion
to launch your future film.

1418
01:21:16,373 --> 01:21:17,931
But, what's wrong?

1419
01:21:18,008 --> 01:21:19,270
Once the marriage
is done with. - Yes.

1420
01:21:19,342 --> 01:21:22,834
And refuses to give the
money at the reception? - No.

1421
01:21:23,113 --> 01:21:25,172
That's not possible.
- I'm telling you, dad.

1422
01:21:25,649 --> 01:21:27,014
Don't take a risk.

1423
01:21:28,151 --> 01:21:29,448
And anyway, I've decided.

1424
01:21:30,620 --> 01:21:31,587
Decided what?

1425
01:21:32,589 --> 01:21:34,318
First the money, then the marriage.

1426
01:21:36,593 --> 01:21:38,185
Listen to this. - Go ahead.

1427
01:21:40,130 --> 01:21:45,466
Boyfriend: If I kiss
you what will you think of me?

1428
01:21:46,236 --> 01:21:47,863
Girlfriend: Stupid.

1429
01:21:48,505 --> 01:21:49,597
Boyfriend: Why?

1430
01:21:49,939 --> 01:21:54,035
If you taste only pickle,
instead of the entire plate...

1431
01:21:54,110 --> 01:21:55,407
...then you're stupid.

1432
01:22:01,117 --> 01:22:01,344
Your phone...

1433
01:22:01,418 --> 01:22:03,283
Hello. - Mr. Sabharwal.

1434
01:22:04,054 --> 01:22:04,850
Yes.

1435
01:22:05,188 --> 01:22:08,248
I had to say something important.
- Go ahead.

1436
01:22:08,591 --> 01:22:11,822
The dowry amount,
that was decided between us...

1437
01:22:12,295 --> 01:22:16,459
...we want them before the marriage.
- What's wrong?

1438
01:22:16,533 --> 01:22:20,162
Nothing, it's a personal requirement.

1439
01:22:20,236 --> 01:22:24,036
I'll tell you later. - But,
Mr. Kapoor, we had agreed that...

1440
01:22:24,107 --> 01:22:26,541
...the money will be given
in Mumbai during the reception.

1441
01:22:26,609 --> 01:22:28,440
No, we want it before the wedding.

1442
01:22:28,511 --> 01:22:29,603
Just make the arrangements.

1443
01:22:29,679 --> 01:22:30,338
Yes.

1444
01:22:30,413 --> 01:22:31,243
Listen...

1445
01:22:32,315 --> 01:22:33,976
Okay?

1446
01:22:35,051 --> 01:22:37,884
Now you acted more like Aman's dad.

1447
01:22:38,955 --> 01:22:41,116
I'm your father after all.

1448
01:22:41,391 --> 01:22:42,551
Fool.

1449
01:22:56,539 --> 01:22:59,167
There's a problem. - Go ahead.

1450
01:22:59,242 --> 01:23:01,039
I had an agreement with Tej Kapoor...

1451
01:23:01,111 --> 01:23:03,341
...that the dowry money will
be given at the reception, in Mumbai.

1452
01:23:04,114 --> 01:23:05,547
But, he's gone back on his words.

1453
01:23:06,249 --> 01:23:08,012
He wants the money first, only then...

1454
01:23:08,551 --> 01:23:09,643
...will he go ahead with the marriage.

1455
01:23:10,453 --> 01:23:14,514
So... please arrange the
bank money that I kept with you...

1456
01:23:14,591 --> 01:23:15,990
...l'm coming to get them.

1457
01:23:16,392 --> 01:23:19,054
Stay there. - Why? What happened?

1458
01:23:19,129 --> 01:23:22,064
Saturn's fury is at its last stage.

1459
01:23:22,966 --> 01:23:25,935
I don't want any obstructions
in Gudiya's marriage.

1460
01:23:26,970 --> 01:23:29,461
Make preparations for
the steps I told you to take...

1461
01:23:30,373 --> 01:23:31,897
...to escape Saturn's fury.

1462
01:23:33,309 --> 01:23:34,606
I'll get the money personally.

1463
01:23:37,514 --> 01:23:41,177
Bagga. Have you arranged
for 100 Brahmins...

1464
01:23:41,251 --> 01:23:43,685
...before the wedding? - Yes.

1465
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:45,109
All the arrangements have been done.

1466
01:23:46,790 --> 01:23:47,586
What's wrong?

1467
01:23:57,567 --> 01:23:58,556
The money's reached the farmhouse.

1468
01:23:58,935 --> 01:24:01,062
I'll return you every penny.

1469
01:24:02,038 --> 01:24:03,300
With interest.

1470
01:24:04,007 --> 01:24:06,475
Just have faith.

1471
01:24:14,584 --> 01:24:16,176
Why the long face?

1472
01:24:16,252 --> 01:24:18,550
Make a happy face.
You're getting married today.

1473
01:24:18,621 --> 01:24:20,111
So what if I'm getting married.

1474
01:24:20,190 --> 01:24:21,350
That cheat Sabharwal said...

1475
01:24:21,424 --> 01:24:22,413
...the groom will
descend in a helicopter.

1476
01:24:22,692 --> 01:24:23,488
Where's the helicopter?

1477
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:25,892
Superstar Aman's riding
on a peacock shaped chariot.

1478
01:24:27,030 --> 01:24:29,225
I won't step inside
without seeing the money.

1479
01:24:29,299 --> 01:24:30,391
Tell me this.

1480
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:33,032
When I didn't get married
without seeing the money...

1481
01:24:33,102 --> 01:24:34,034
...I won't let you either.

1482
01:24:34,103 --> 01:24:35,001
Don't worry.

1483
01:24:35,305 --> 01:24:37,671
Once you get the money,
buy yourself a helicopter.

1484
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:38,365
Okay?

1485
01:24:38,441 --> 01:24:40,204
Now, smile.

1486
01:24:41,010 --> 01:24:42,341
Come on. Start playing.

1487
01:25:25,521 --> 01:25:27,682
I think I've seen them before.

1488
01:25:30,393 --> 01:25:31,587
I just...

1489
01:25:39,035 --> 01:25:41,003
Sabharwal. Congratulations.

1490
01:25:41,070 --> 01:25:44,005
Congratulations.
- Congratulations to you too.

1491
01:25:45,174 --> 01:25:46,141
Let me introduce you.

1492
01:25:46,542 --> 01:25:48,442
She's Mrs. Hansal Mehta
from Hansal Group of Companies.

1493
01:25:49,612 --> 01:25:51,079
She's like family.

1494
01:25:51,147 --> 01:25:52,614
Special guest.

1495
01:25:52,682 --> 01:25:54,547
Come in. Come. - Come on.

1496
01:25:54,617 --> 01:25:56,016
Dad.

1497
01:25:57,954 --> 01:26:00,320
Sabharwal,
I forgot to say something. - Yes.

1498
01:26:00,390 --> 01:26:03,416
Aman wanted to see the bride once.

1499
01:26:04,260 --> 01:26:06,660
Son, you can't before
the marriage... - No!

1500
01:26:06,729 --> 01:26:09,061
Sabharwal, you didn't get it.

1501
01:26:10,099 --> 01:26:12,124
Bride... - Okay, come in.

1502
01:26:12,201 --> 01:26:12,929
Come. Come.

1503
01:26:13,269 --> 01:26:14,327
Come on.

1504
01:26:15,705 --> 01:26:16,330
Come on.

1505
01:26:18,041 --> 01:26:19,372
There you go, bro.

1506
01:26:21,177 --> 01:26:22,235
You see, Sabharwal.

1507
01:26:22,612 --> 01:26:24,546
I want to tell you
something personal.

1508
01:26:25,048 --> 01:26:28,245
If it wasn't an emergency,
I wouldn't have troubled you.

1509
01:26:28,318 --> 01:26:30,411
Sir, this is no
trouble at all. - Yes.

1510
01:26:30,486 --> 01:26:33,011
Whether you slit the
hen at the shop or the jungle.

1511
01:26:33,356 --> 01:26:34,914
But, its fate decided.

1512
01:26:35,525 --> 01:26:36,549
Sorry, sorry.

1513
01:26:36,626 --> 01:26:39,288
Son-in-law.
The money isn't going anywhere.

1514
01:26:39,362 --> 01:26:40,329
The money's safe here.

1515
01:26:40,763 --> 01:26:41,991
Not to worry.

1516
01:26:42,265 --> 01:26:45,257
Bagga. Tell him a new joke.

1517
01:26:45,335 --> 01:26:47,303
He's a good man.

1518
01:26:47,370 --> 01:26:48,564
You've trained him well.

1519
01:26:48,638 --> 01:26:50,265
You just snap your
fingers 'Bagga... Bagga... '

1520
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:53,336
Kapoor, he's the
dog that never barks.

1521
01:26:53,743 --> 01:26:55,074
Only cracks jokes.

1522
01:26:57,981 --> 01:26:59,539
Come on.

1523
01:27:01,117 --> 01:27:04,348
Stop. Stop.

1524
01:27:04,420 --> 01:27:06,149
You start instantly.

1525
01:27:06,222 --> 01:27:07,553
You see, Sabharwal.

1526
01:27:08,024 --> 01:27:10,618
It's my son's wedding, you
think we're here to listen to jokes.

1527
01:27:10,693 --> 01:27:12,285
Not at all.

1528
01:27:12,362 --> 01:27:15,229
Bro, I've arranged a
wonderful program for you.

1529
01:27:15,965 --> 01:27:18,593
You'll be amazed.

1530
01:27:18,935 --> 01:27:19,594
You're going to have fun.

1531
01:27:19,936 --> 01:27:21,233
Let's go. - Come on.

1532
01:27:21,304 --> 01:27:22,635
Bagga, wait here.

1533
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:36,617
"Night of bliss."

1534
01:27:37,353 --> 01:27:39,878
"Beloved's hot-hot."

1535
01:27:40,623 --> 01:27:42,386
"Night of bliss."

1536
01:27:42,458 --> 01:27:44,085
"Beloved's hot-hot."

1537
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:47,493
"I'm capturing my beloved's
image through my eyes."

1538
01:27:47,563 --> 01:27:50,691
"I'll sway, play hard to get."

1539
01:27:50,767 --> 01:27:54,259
"I'll sway, play hard to get."

1540
01:27:54,337 --> 01:27:57,829
"Beware my beloved."

1541
01:27:58,141 --> 01:27:59,073
Sukhi...

1542
01:27:59,142 --> 01:28:05,377
"I'll do the serpent...
serpent dance."

1543
01:28:05,915 --> 01:28:12,445
"I'll do the serpent...
serpent dance."

1544
01:28:26,035 --> 01:28:29,368
"The shiny nose-ring pin."

1545
01:28:29,439 --> 01:28:32,101
"The danglers in my ears."

1546
01:28:33,076 --> 01:28:34,668
"The shiny nose-ring pin."

1547
01:28:35,011 --> 01:28:36,501
"The danglers in my ears."

1548
01:28:36,579 --> 01:28:39,605
"Are only for you,
they stole your heart."

1549
01:28:39,949 --> 01:28:43,248
"Beloved, my plan is."

1550
01:28:43,319 --> 01:28:46,413
"Beloved, my plan is."

1551
01:28:47,056 --> 01:28:50,583
"I won't let go of you so easily."

1552
01:28:51,561 --> 01:28:58,057
"I'll do the serpent...
serpent dance."

1553
01:28:58,367 --> 01:29:05,205
"I'll do the serpent...
serpent dance."

1554
01:29:11,914 --> 01:29:14,405
"Gulp down that drink."

1555
01:29:15,084 --> 01:29:17,644
"And groove on the floor."

1556
01:29:18,488 --> 01:29:21,150
"Dance with me, darling."

1557
01:29:21,958 --> 01:29:24,984
"Now get up from that seat."

1558
01:29:25,661 --> 01:29:29,097
"Or I won't spare you,
I'll bite you."

1559
01:29:29,165 --> 01:29:32,225
"Or I won't spare you,
I'll bite you."

1560
01:29:32,535 --> 01:29:36,995
"I won't step back."

1561
01:29:39,142 --> 01:29:45,672
"I'll do the serpent...
serpent dance."

1562
01:29:45,748 --> 01:29:52,551
"I'll do the serpent...
serpent dance."

1563
01:29:52,622 --> 01:29:59,323
"I'll do the serpent...
serpent dance."

1564
01:29:59,395 --> 01:30:06,198
"I'll do the serpent...
serpent dance."

1565
01:30:06,269 --> 01:30:09,204
"...serpent dance."

1566
01:30:10,072 --> 01:30:11,835
Thank you, priest.

1567
01:30:12,241 --> 01:30:13,367
Do give your blessings.

1568
01:30:14,210 --> 01:30:15,268
Thank you.

1569
01:30:18,014 --> 01:30:19,242
Come on. Please.

1570
01:30:19,549 --> 01:30:21,073
Keep moving.

1571
01:30:35,665 --> 01:30:39,101
Mr. Aman Kapoor. Call for you.

1572
01:30:39,168 --> 01:30:40,499
Who is it? - Don't know.

1573
01:30:40,570 --> 01:30:42,128
But he says it's important.

1574
01:30:42,205 --> 01:30:43,194
It's urgent.

1575
01:30:45,474 --> 01:30:48,136
Hello. - Praise the Divine Mother!

1576
01:30:48,211 --> 01:30:50,304
You're being fooled. - What?

1577
01:30:50,680 --> 01:30:52,079
What nonsense.

1578
01:30:53,449 --> 01:30:55,314
And, who are you? - I am Obama.

1579
01:30:55,384 --> 01:30:57,045
Listen to me carefully.

1580
01:30:57,119 --> 01:30:58,416
You've been duped big time.

1581
01:30:58,487 --> 01:31:00,182
The money,
for which you're getting married...

1582
01:31:00,523 --> 01:31:02,423
...has disappeared from the bag.

1583
01:31:02,491 --> 01:31:03,583
Forget the movie.

1584
01:31:03,659 --> 01:31:05,286
You can't even make an ad film now.

1585
01:31:07,230 --> 01:31:08,822
Check the bag before the nuptials.

1586
01:31:09,232 --> 01:31:10,995
Otherwise, you'll be the loser.

1587
01:31:11,067 --> 01:31:12,967
Hello. Hello.

1588
01:31:18,107 --> 01:31:18,630
What's wrong?

1589
01:31:18,708 --> 01:31:19,640
What happened?

1590
01:31:20,376 --> 01:31:21,343
What happened? - What happened?

1591
01:31:21,410 --> 01:31:23,571
It's nothing.
I'll be right back. Wait here.

1592
01:31:23,646 --> 01:31:25,580
What did he say? - What?

1593
01:31:25,915 --> 01:31:27,348
Listen to me, son.

1594
01:31:31,454 --> 01:31:35,049
What happened?
Who was it? - Don't know.

1595
01:31:38,094 --> 01:31:40,858
Dad. Stop this sham.

1596
01:31:41,130 --> 01:31:42,620
They take us for fools.

1597
01:31:45,701 --> 01:31:46,633
What's this, uncle?

1598
01:31:47,036 --> 01:31:48,060
What is all this?

1599
01:31:48,137 --> 01:31:50,435
See. The money has
disappeared from the bag.

1600
01:31:50,506 --> 01:31:52,406
And... these papers...

1601
01:31:52,475 --> 01:31:54,170
What do you want me to do with them?

1602
01:31:54,910 --> 01:31:57,435
I warned you. They're frauds.

1603
01:31:59,248 --> 01:32:01,307
Mr. Sabharwal, what's this?

1604
01:32:01,384 --> 01:32:02,316
Where's the money?

1605
01:32:02,652 --> 01:32:04,244
Where's the money, Sabharwal?

1606
01:32:04,687 --> 01:32:05,346
Hold on.

1607
01:32:05,421 --> 01:32:06,183
Hold on, Mr. Kapoor.

1608
01:32:06,255 --> 01:32:08,917
Even I would like to
know where my money is.

1609
01:32:11,894 --> 01:32:12,918
Let's go inside and talk.

1610
01:32:12,995 --> 01:32:16,158
Sabharwal, let's talk here.

1611
01:32:16,232 --> 01:32:17,256
In front of everyone.

1612
01:32:17,333 --> 01:32:19,233
And, where's the money? - The money...

1613
01:32:19,669 --> 01:32:21,193
You saw the money yourself, and...

1614
01:32:22,204 --> 01:32:23,466
Bagga!

1615
01:32:24,240 --> 01:32:25,537
Bagga!

1616
01:32:26,309 --> 01:32:27,606
Bagga!

1617
01:32:28,311 --> 01:32:29,278
Bagga!

1618
01:32:29,345 --> 01:32:30,573
Where's he?

1619
01:32:31,147 --> 01:32:32,580
He was supposed to
look after the money.

1620
01:32:32,915 --> 01:32:33,574
Where is he?

1621
01:32:33,649 --> 01:32:35,378
What's happening with me?

1622
01:32:35,451 --> 01:32:38,011
Don't act innocent, Sabharwal.

1623
01:32:39,055 --> 01:32:40,989
You wanted to trick
us into the marriage...

1624
01:32:41,324 --> 01:32:43,121
With your average daughter... - Hey!

1625
01:32:43,192 --> 01:32:45,057
Shut up!

1626
01:32:46,228 --> 01:32:49,629
Don't you dare say
a word about my daughter.

1627
01:32:49,699 --> 01:32:52,463
Or I won't spare you.
- Brother-in-law's right.

1628
01:32:53,002 --> 01:32:55,232
We've seen many TV stars like you.

1629
01:32:55,504 --> 01:32:57,563
No need to endure anymore
humiliation, brother-in-law.

1630
01:32:58,040 --> 01:32:59,439
Hey you, TV Star.

1631
01:32:59,508 --> 01:33:01,601
You and your guests just
get the hell out of here!

1632
01:33:01,677 --> 01:33:02,439
Stop this nonsense.

1633
01:33:02,978 --> 01:33:04,343
Enough of this sham.

1634
01:33:05,147 --> 01:33:06,546
Dad, the wedding's cancelled.

1635
01:33:06,615 --> 01:33:09,106
Get out of here. - Wait.
The wedding's definitely cancelled.

1636
01:33:09,485 --> 01:33:10,884
Let me talk to him.

1637
01:33:11,153 --> 01:33:15,556
Sabharwal.
Hansal Mehta had already told me...

1638
01:33:16,158 --> 01:33:17,682
...that you're a big fraud.

1639
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:22,322
But, I cannot believe
you can stoop so low...

1640
01:33:22,665 --> 01:33:25,532
...and cheat in your own
daughter's wedding... - Shut up!

1641
01:33:25,601 --> 01:33:26,158
Rascal!

1642
01:33:26,235 --> 01:33:28,032
Shut up, you rascal!

1643
01:33:28,504 --> 01:33:29,493
Shut up!

1644
01:33:30,172 --> 01:33:31,469
Do you know who you're talking to?

1645
01:33:32,274 --> 01:33:34,139
Sabharwal! This is my empire!

1646
01:33:34,210 --> 01:33:35,472
Who's this Mrs. Hansal?

1647
01:33:35,544 --> 01:33:37,011
Tell me. Who knows me better?

1648
01:33:37,079 --> 01:33:37,602
Who is it?

1649
01:33:37,980 --> 01:33:38,969
Tell me.

1650
01:33:42,985 --> 01:33:45,954
I am not Mrs. Hansal Mehta.

1651
01:33:47,356 --> 01:33:49,620
Who are you? - Jasbeer Baweja.

1652
01:33:50,559 --> 01:33:52,459
Ravinder Baweja's wife.

1653
01:33:54,430 --> 01:33:58,025
Oh? Can't understand, Sabharwal?

1654
01:33:58,100 --> 01:33:59,499
Wait a minute, aunt.

1655
01:33:59,568 --> 01:34:02,059
We'll explain him with little jolts.

1656
01:34:02,138 --> 01:34:05,266
We tricked the principal
of your school Sethi...

1657
01:34:05,341 --> 01:34:07,434
...and robbed you of 300 million.

1658
01:34:08,277 --> 01:34:09,471
'What brings you here? '

1659
01:34:09,945 --> 01:34:12,937
'You didn't visit the
school for a long time... '

1660
01:34:13,282 --> 01:34:17,116
'... so, I just wanted
to see if you're okay.'

1661
01:34:17,420 --> 01:34:20,981
And then,
we raided your dairy as well.

1662
01:34:22,091 --> 01:34:23,888
'Brother-in-law, there's a problem.'

1663
01:34:24,326 --> 01:34:25,623
'There's been a raid at the dairy.'

1664
01:34:26,061 --> 01:34:28,256
The video-recording has already
been delivered to the police.

1665
01:34:29,331 --> 01:34:31,561
And then,
we made you dance to our tunes...

1666
01:34:31,634 --> 01:34:32,965
...to take your money.

1667
01:34:33,269 --> 01:34:34,702
Manpreet!

1668
01:34:36,639 --> 01:34:40,234
Rascals. You don't know who I am.

1669
01:34:40,309 --> 01:34:42,277
We know who you are.

1670
01:34:43,012 --> 01:34:45,378
My father lost his
life because of you.

1671
01:34:46,282 --> 01:34:48,147
And sister-in-law
Saira's still in jail.

1672
01:34:48,717 --> 01:34:51,948
I am Sukhwinder Baweja,
Ravinder Baweja's son.

1673
01:34:52,988 --> 01:34:57,015
I swore to restore
my father's reputation.

1674
01:34:57,092 --> 01:35:01,222
Just like you robbed the investors...

1675
01:35:01,297 --> 01:35:02,855
...and put the blame on Mr. Baweja.

1676
01:35:03,232 --> 01:35:05,598
Similarly,
we robbed you of your money.

1677
01:35:05,935 --> 01:35:07,562
Robbed my money.

1678
01:35:11,073 --> 01:35:15,305
Just try to take that
money out of Sabharwal's house.

1679
01:35:15,377 --> 01:35:17,868
The money's already
left the farm house.

1680
01:35:18,147 --> 01:35:20,377
And, you've personally returned...

1681
01:35:20,449 --> 01:35:22,212
...the investors their
money with interest.

1682
01:35:22,284 --> 01:35:23,581
Fool.

1683
01:35:27,356 --> 01:35:29,017
'Come on. Please.'

1684
01:35:29,091 --> 01:35:30,388
'Keep moving.'

1685
01:35:36,499 --> 01:35:37,625
Sir.

1686
01:35:38,634 --> 01:35:41,000
How about a joke?

1687
01:35:42,104 --> 01:35:43,264
Forget it.

1688
01:35:43,606 --> 01:35:45,301
Today, you're the joke.

1689
01:35:47,576 --> 01:35:49,009
Bagga, you...

1690
01:35:49,979 --> 01:35:53,210
You betrayed your own employer.

1691
01:35:54,917 --> 01:36:00,549
And yes, Sabharwal's
killed many Bawejas, and now...

1692
01:36:00,623 --> 01:36:02,056
Papa. - Gudiya, move.

1693
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:06,255
Move aside. Move!

1694
01:36:07,997 --> 01:36:09,658
That's enough.

1695
01:36:10,933 --> 01:36:13,128
I could never imagine...

1696
01:36:14,169 --> 01:36:17,866
...you could do such a thing.

1697
01:36:20,042 --> 01:36:24,308
After mom's death,
you were everything for me.

1698
01:36:25,648 --> 01:36:27,240
My hero.

1699
01:36:28,951 --> 01:36:30,543
But you hurt me.

1700
01:36:32,021 --> 01:36:34,182
Go away from here.

1701
01:36:35,658 --> 01:36:37,057
Please go away.

1702
01:36:43,232 --> 01:36:45,325
This had to happen, Sabharwal.

1703
01:36:47,770 --> 01:36:51,001
You can't get a bigger punishment.

1704
01:36:52,708 --> 01:36:57,475
Mr. Baweja's soul
is finally at peace now.

1705
01:37:07,690 --> 01:37:10,124
In view of all the
statements and witnesses...

1706
01:37:10,192 --> 01:37:12,524
...the court sentences
Mohan Sabharwal...

1707
01:37:12,595 --> 01:37:15,655
...to 7 years of
rigorous imprisonment.

1708
01:37:21,570 --> 01:37:25,062
'Life didn't stop with
Sabharwal's punishment.

1709
01:37:25,140 --> 01:37:27,335
Sukhi and Manpreet got married.

1710
01:37:27,409 --> 01:37:29,536
Granny got her free
cable TV connection.

1711
01:37:29,612 --> 01:37:32,274
Mintu's seen less cooking
and more in religious parties.

1712
01:37:32,348 --> 01:37:35,181
Ballu was always a fixer,
and he still is.

1713
01:37:35,250 --> 01:37:37,616
Kabootar got admission,
without the donation.

1714
01:37:37,686 --> 01:37:41,281
And, Bagga found a big
family to tell his jokes.

1715
01:37:41,357 --> 01:37:43,450
But, our mom's truly amazing.

1716
01:37:43,525 --> 01:37:45,652
We've seen many super-heroes...

1717
01:37:45,728 --> 01:37:49,220
...but, not a super-heroine
like our mom.

1718
01:37:56,972 --> 01:37:59,031
"Play on."

1719
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:07,305
"So you think you're smart."

1720
01:38:08,017 --> 01:38:11,475
"Whenever someone cheats you,
troubles you."

1721
01:38:11,553 --> 01:38:13,646
"Locks horns with you all the time."

1722
01:38:14,023 --> 01:38:17,288
"Snatches your rights,
tries to scare you."

1723
01:38:17,359 --> 01:38:19,554
"Just teach him a lesson, buddy."

1724
01:38:19,628 --> 01:38:23,064
"Whenever someone cheats you,
troubles you."

1725
01:38:23,132 --> 01:38:25,362
"Locks horns with you all the time."

1726
01:38:25,434 --> 01:38:28,562
"Snatches your rights,
tries to scare you."

1727
01:38:28,937 --> 01:38:31,303
"Just teach him a lesson, buddy."

1728
01:38:31,373 --> 01:38:33,568
"Play on."

1729
01:38:37,212 --> 01:38:40,409
"Play on."

1730
01:38:42,985 --> 01:38:46,682
"Play on."

1731
01:38:48,691 --> 01:38:51,956
"Play on."

1732
01:38:54,663 --> 01:38:57,427
"They've a good report."

1733
01:38:57,900 --> 01:39:00,425
"They've the support of God."

1734
01:39:00,502 --> 01:39:03,335
"They're always after
those with wrong intentions."

1735
01:39:03,405 --> 01:39:05,430
"And a bad heart."

1736
01:39:05,507 --> 01:39:08,965
"When someone pollutes the world,
we calm him down."

1737
01:39:09,044 --> 01:39:12,013
"When someone picks a fight with us,
we teach him a lesson."

1738
01:39:12,081 --> 01:39:16,950
"No point in sitting down, give
a tit for tat Make that your rule."

1739
01:39:17,453 --> 01:39:21,116
"Play on."

1740
01:39:23,192 --> 01:39:27,060
"Play on."

1741
01:39:51,954 --> 01:39:55,117
"Whenever someone cheats you,
troubles you."

1742
01:39:55,190 --> 01:39:57,420
"Locks horns with you all the time."

1743
01:39:57,493 --> 01:40:00,985
"Snatches your rights,
tries to scare you."

1744
01:40:01,063 --> 01:40:03,224
"Just teach him a lesson, buddy."

1745
01:40:03,298 --> 01:40:06,563
"Whenever someone cheats you,
troubles you."

1746
01:40:06,635 --> 01:40:09,195
"Locks horns with you all the time."

1747
01:40:09,271 --> 01:40:12,399
"Snatches your rights,
tries to scare you."

1748
01:40:12,474 --> 01:40:15,068
"Just teach him a lesson, buddy."

1749
01:40:15,144 --> 01:40:18,170
"Play on."

1750
01:40:20,716 --> 01:40:24,846
"Play on."

1751
01:40:26,989 --> 01:40:29,617
"Be the king, stop being afraid."

1752
01:40:29,958 --> 01:40:32,586
"Help the needy."

1753
01:40:32,661 --> 01:40:35,425
"Don't spare those who act smart."

1754
01:40:35,497 --> 01:40:37,624
"Just do as I say."

1755
01:40:37,699 --> 01:40:39,667
"Whenever someone creates
a problem for you."

1756
01:40:39,735 --> 01:40:41,202
"And troubles you."

1757
01:40:41,270 --> 01:40:44,171
"Whenever someone ditches
you and avoids you."

1758
01:40:44,239 --> 01:40:45,399
"No point in sitting down."

1759
01:40:45,474 --> 01:40:49,308
"Give a tit for tat
Make that your rule."

1760
01:40:49,611 --> 01:40:51,977
"Play on."

1761
01:40:55,350 --> 01:40:58,012
