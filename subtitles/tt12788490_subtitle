1
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,000
(Fireflies)

2
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:42,125
Wasting your time again?

3
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:43,666
Meaning?

4
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,083
Do you even know what you are studying?

5
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:48,333
Maths. Can't you tell?

6
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:50,333
Is this the way?

7
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:51,500
Wait

8
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:53,458
Please!

9
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,416
Solve this.

10
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:08,333
Which one? Fifth or sixth?

11
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,208
This one.

12
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,083
OK.

13
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:16,958
You've memorised it?

14
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,458
Who memorises maths?

15
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:20,916
You do.
You're crazy

16
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:24,333
How did you answer so fast without memorising it?

17
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:28,791
I didn't!
Maths stays with me like a painting.

18
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,791
Well, that's called memorising

19
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:35,041
Don't you call me a copy machine?
Why question me now?

20
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:38,750
I can remember all that I see

21
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:43,791
Go be an artist then.
That's all you're good for

22
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:44,875
Sister...

23
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:49,666
Can you cut my sleeves like yours?
It's too warm.

24
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,375
Why not just take off your shirt?

25
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,333
Think I have no shame?

26
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,416
What shame?
Aren' t you a boy?

27
00:04:55,416 --> 00:05:00,083
So? Must only girls feel shame?
Aren't we all the same?

28
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:01,916
Say that to your elder brother

29
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,166
Will you spend all morning
applying turmeric on your face?

30
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:06,708
Go get some flour

31
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,375
Dilip-da!

32
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:53,000
What's up, heroine? Has jaundice hit you?

33
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,250
I need wheat flour

34
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:04,875
Isn't your brother getting too girly?

35
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,458
It's just Aunt's love softening him

36
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,208
Look! Petrol price hiked to 80 rupees

37
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,500
umm..

38
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:31,250
Using up all our drinking water for your bath?

39
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,583
Your brother will thrash you
if there's none left

40
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,458
I'm re-filling it

41
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,583
Oh God, our expenses!

42
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,041
We owe 6000 to the grocer

43
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:55,541
Should I not eat then?

44
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:56,833
What's wrong with you?

45
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,375
Can't you wear something else!

46
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,083
You gave birth to two specimens, mother

47
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:09,125
One, a boy who behaves like a girl
The other, a girl who behaves like a man

48
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,416
Both have made us notorious in this village

49
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:03,041
We've not plucked the mangoes
and this one is set to eat them

50
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:06,166
Watch out!
We shouldn't be caught

51
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:07,250
Let's go!

52
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,500
What's going on?

53
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:24,916
Peeing...

54
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,500
You're definitely a girl

55
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:02,666
Don't worry.
I can't see anything

56
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,625
Have I planted mangoes for you?

57
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:24,791
Huh?

58
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,750
Haven't even eaten one myself!

59
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:34,458
I will tie you up and drag you to your father

60
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:56,625
Go! Don't ever show up again

61
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,458
Are you going to the market?

62
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,416
Hi Ratan.

63
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:40,958
All well?
Hmm...

64
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:42,166
please take these inside?

65
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:42,750
Ok.

66
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:48,708
There will be more power cuts.

67
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,250
Then I will light it again

68
00:11:53,583 --> 00:11:55,833
Does anything besides painting interest him?

69
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:58,416
No, he'll do well. Right?

70
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:23,875
Has Ratan left?

71
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:25,791
He's about to

72
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:26,791
Dear...

73
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,458
What are you doing?

74
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,083
He has finished studying already

75
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:37,208
I'm glad he was at least at the study table till now

76
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,041
Please walk me to the road?

77
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:41,375
I can't right now

78
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:44,125
Go! Walk him to the embankment at least

79
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,833
It's dark

80
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:51,125
Take this torch

81
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,166
Dear...

82
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,666
Uncle, you're back

83
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:12,333
umm.

84
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,916
Where are you going?

85
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:16,208
I only asked him to walk me back

86
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,458
Get me some tobacco on your way back.

87
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:42,833
Please accompany me to the temple?

88
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:01,583
Isn't this a beautiful evening.
Let's sit for a while?

89
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:03,083
No, I need to be at home

90
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:05,750
Don't worry, just for a while. Come, sit

91
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,958
Just a while. Sit...

92
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,416
Look at the sky.

93
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:26,708
You are so soft...

94
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:33,583
My muscles used to be tight.
But now I am gaining weight.

95
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,125
Feel this?

96
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:50,500
Can you feel the stitch?

97
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:55,416
Got operated two years ago
as my foreskin wasn't coming off

98
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:58,000
Does yours come off?

99
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,666
Hold tight.

100
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:46,750
What happened?

101
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,666
Never allow that man to come home again!

102
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:51,958
Who? Ratan?

103
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:52,791
Yes!

104
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:53,791
What's happening?

105
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:58,458
You two fight all the time

106
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,083
Who's fighting?

107
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:02,583
Didn't you this afternoon
with your elder brother?

108
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:03,791
When did I fight?

109
00:16:05,416 --> 00:16:09,541
You guys always blame the girl.
It's never the boy's fault

110
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:12,291
Hold your tongue

111
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,166
Did you get my tobacco?

112
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,125
I forgot.

113
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:35,000
Don't worry. I know what's happening.
I'll deal with him tomorrow

114
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:14,083
Someone bring the microscope.

115
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:15,458
Wait.

116
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,666
Jahnu, you go.

117
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:19,916
Lady, go!

118
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,000
Behave

119
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,208
Can't you be nice?

120
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,916
Everyone calls him a lady

121
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:26,791
Should you also insult him?

122
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:28,291
He IS a â€˜lady'

123
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,833
Bathes with filtered water

124
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:36,125
Even wears henna on his hands

125
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:49,458
I can't stand this Bubu's face

126
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:51,750
Both brothers are jerks

127
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,291
Bubu is even worse than Prince

128
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:55,708
They hate our family

129
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:58,500
That's because your sister slapped him

130
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,375
The voyeurs eyed the girls as they bathed

131
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,666
Ask Hussain to wait for me, okay?

132
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:17,458
Do you have rubber bands?
Wait for me. I'll return with the money

133
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:08,916
Show me this one?

134
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:17,083
This doesn't look nice, does it?

135
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,625
Show me that

136
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:24,708
Please buy one for me too?
I'll pay you later.

137
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:27,375
I'm just looking.
Dad gave me just 50 bucks.

138
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,125
Here's the money for the rubber band

139
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,250
Think your brother will let you wear a necklace?

140
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,000
Maina! Get the cows

141
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:37,958
Maina

142
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:42,375
Why not taste the lady for yourself?

143
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:43,458
You rascal!

144
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:45,541
He will taste exactly like a girl

145
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:46,875
And not get pregnant!

146
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:47,916
Gross!

147
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:12,916
I don't recall who I left the baby with when you called.
Aunt will be angry

148
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,708
Why must you babysit all the time?

149
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,250
My aunt handles everything alone

150
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:20,208
Uncle never helps with housework,
even on weekends or holidays

151
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:22,958
My dad works as much as my mother.
Even cooks for us.

152
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:24,500
My dad cooks as well

153
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,041
Some people are strange

154
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:30,583
My uncle and aunt both work at the office
But it's my aunt who does all the housework

155
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:33,083
We may all do so after marriage

156
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:36,458
Not me!
He must share work equally

157
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,916
Who eats unripe cherries?

158
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:00,083
I do

159
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:24,166
Where are you placing those?

160
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:30,875
Who does that?

161
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:38,000
Teacher.

162
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:40,416
She's calling you

163
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:15,666
You go home with Liku

164
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:17,333
Maina can take her on his bicycle

165
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:18,208
Who is Maina?

166
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:19,166
Jahnu.

167
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:22,250
Please take her home

168
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:36,291
He will fuck one of them while acting like a lady

169
00:24:56,041 --> 00:24:57,666
What's up, lady?

170
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:15,625
Heroine, where to? Wait for the ceremony.
Boys aren't allowed now

171
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:19,875
But you can go now.
Aren't you Pradip's daughter?

172
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:22,458
Is that true, heroine?

173
00:25:22,458 --> 00:25:26,583
We must strip you to be sure

174
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,500
Wait! Where are you going?

175
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,708
You love stripping people, don't you?

176
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:35,333
Angry lady!

177
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:08,875
Lady, pass the ball!

178
00:26:13,791 --> 00:26:15,250
You bastard

179
00:26:16,583 --> 00:26:18,833
Bastard! Get the ball

180
00:26:18,833 --> 00:26:21,708
Leave him. His brother is watching

181
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,958
I miss Nibi so much

182
00:27:16,958 --> 00:27:22,958
She's the only who understands me
Everyone else laughs at me

183
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:26,500
Please make me beautiful like Nibi?

184
00:27:32,583 --> 00:27:38,708
I swear on you.
From now, I won't fear anyone

185
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I will be who I am
I'll share my feelings only with you

186
00:27:48,791 --> 00:27:54,250
My thoughts will flow with you
to the heart of the sea

187
00:28:00,791 --> 00:28:03,250
I am going to the big river

188
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:46,541
Maina

189
00:28:48,166 --> 00:28:49,375
Where are you going?

190
00:28:49,916 --> 00:28:51,291
Just roaming around.

191
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:56,458
Why come so far all alone?

192
00:28:58,541 --> 00:29:00,208
I'm going to the river

193
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:04,500
I'll join you.
Come to my place?

194
00:29:05,833 --> 00:29:08,625
I must go alone and return home soon

195
00:29:08,625 --> 00:29:11,291
Please come!

196
00:29:57,333 --> 00:30:02,458
For you.
Please sit

197
00:30:19,416 --> 00:30:21,166
You still sing?

198
00:30:21,166 --> 00:30:22,333
Sometimes.

199
00:30:23,208 --> 00:30:25,541
Why have you stopped singing
at the village festival?

200
00:30:25,958 --> 00:30:28,458
I don't like the villagers anymore

201
00:30:29,041 --> 00:30:32,166
Why?
Are these your books?

202
00:30:32,166 --> 00:30:33,666
Umm

203
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:36,083
I still like to read

204
00:30:36,083 --> 00:30:38,333
Why don't you like the villagers?

205
00:30:40,625 --> 00:30:42,750
Do you like them?

206
00:30:44,708 --> 00:30:46,916
I understand you, Maina

207
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:51,208
I've been wanting to talk to you

208
00:30:54,750 --> 00:31:01,625
No one understands why I live here aloneâ€¦
away from the village

209
00:31:02,333 --> 00:31:06,541
The villagers think these books
have made me crazy

210
00:31:06,541 --> 00:31:07,916
Hmm

211
00:31:08,875 --> 00:31:14,750
I know you understand me
and that I understand you

212
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,541
Are you also like me?

213
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:20,916
I don't know.
But we share the same struggle

214
00:31:21,458 --> 00:31:24,625
Society will not accept us the way we are

215
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:29,416
I lack the strength to fight everyone

216
00:31:31,333 --> 00:31:33,750
That's why I prefer living alone

217
00:31:36,291 --> 00:31:39,166
Do you have our traditional sari?

218
00:31:39,166 --> 00:31:42,250
Do you like wearing it?

219
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,291
Umm...

220
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:46,833
Wait...

221
00:32:14,541 --> 00:32:16,583
Stand up, please.

222
00:34:58,333 --> 00:35:01,083
Brother! Father is calling you.

223
00:35:05,875 --> 00:35:07,416
Father wants you

224
00:35:11,083 --> 00:35:12,875
The lady is coming

225
00:35:14,791 --> 00:35:16,791
Call him, call him Leave it!

226
00:35:17,833 --> 00:35:18,833
Lady

227
00:35:18,833 --> 00:35:21,458
Madhuri Dixit's movie is on TV!

228
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:25,916
Where did you disappear?

229
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:28,333
Shit! That's Jumu!
You will get us thrashed

230
00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:08,375
Maina

231
00:38:08,708 --> 00:38:09,500
Hey

232
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:15,541
Did you dry the clothes yesterday?

233
00:38:15,541 --> 00:38:16,416
Yes

234
00:38:16,791 --> 00:38:19,833
I had a bra which I can't find

235
00:38:22,291 --> 00:38:24,500
It must be there. Where will it go?

236
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,916
Am I just carrying on for nothing?

237
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:52,875
Sister, it's here

238
00:38:56,041 --> 00:38:58,250
Must have dropped it yesterday

239
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:01,291
I will buy you one.
Wear it as much as you like

240
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,666
Maina, are you up?

241
00:39:12,458 --> 00:39:13,166
Umm...

242
00:39:16,916 --> 00:39:19,125
What are you doing? Get up

243
00:39:19,583 --> 00:39:21,125
Today is Sunday.

244
00:39:22,875 --> 00:39:28,083
We're going to the city.
I need to buy Nibi a gift

245
00:39:28,083 --> 00:39:35,125
For now, I'll give her fruits.
We'll leave as soon as I return. Get ready

246
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:36,125
I want to see Nibi too!

247
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:40,458
Not today.
Wait till the purification bath tomorrow

248
00:39:52,291 --> 00:39:54,916
Nibi, are you hungry?

249
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:57,916
How long is the fasting?

250
00:39:57,916 --> 00:39:58,750
7 Days

251
00:40:01,458 --> 00:40:03,208
Is she eating well?

252
00:40:03,208 --> 00:40:04,041
Yes

253
00:40:04,041 --> 00:40:05,083
Fruit diet

254
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:06,041
right

255
00:40:07,208 --> 00:40:10,500
Nibi, I have got these for you. Do eat

256
00:40:12,791 --> 00:40:13,583
Have some

257
00:40:13,583 --> 00:40:15,208
Don't be shy

258
00:40:15,208 --> 00:40:17,500
You will be a mature girl from tomorrow

259
00:40:24,541 --> 00:40:26,708
Maa, why don't you buy this?

260
00:40:26,708 --> 00:40:28,041
Is this one good?

261
00:40:30,083 --> 00:40:31,458
What else do you have?

262
00:40:31,875 --> 00:40:35,708
I have sunscreen, face cream, face pack...

263
00:40:35,708 --> 00:40:38,125
Face pack?

264
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:40,208
Yes. good for summer

265
00:40:40,208 --> 00:40:42,166
Show me

266
00:40:43,791 --> 00:40:45,416
pass on that pack

267
00:40:46,916 --> 00:40:50,000
show me a pimple removal stick?

268
00:40:53,541 --> 00:40:54,666
What is this called?

269
00:40:54,666 --> 00:40:56,250
Pimple remover

270
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:00,250
Never seen it before.

271
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:02,125
This is also good

272
00:41:02,125 --> 00:41:03,583
How do you use it?

273
00:41:06,125 --> 00:41:07,375
You want this?

274
00:41:09,291 --> 00:41:10,750
Body lotion?

275
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,166
Shall I keep these back?

276
00:41:12,166 --> 00:41:13,583
Hey this has come out

277
00:41:34,875 --> 00:41:36,500
do you have a complete makeup set?

278
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:38,375
Yes but it will be expensive

279
00:41:38,375 --> 00:41:40,041
why expensive?

280
00:41:40,041 --> 00:41:41,375
It is a branded product.
You will find all makeup items in it.

281
00:41:41,375 --> 00:41:42,875
Are you sure?

282
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:43,375
Definitely.

283
00:42:25,041 --> 00:42:27,291
Aunt is calling you again.

284
00:42:52,791 --> 00:43:13,291
Do calm down from today, Nibi dear. You are
a blossoming red flower, from which bees suck off nectar

285
00:43:16,833 --> 00:44:04,750
Dear Nibi, from today, live carefully.
Do listen to your mother, Don't roam around or wander.

286
00:44:08,416 --> 00:44:13,375
Now presenting to you Likumoni Choudhury's
dance performance

287
00:44:26,375 --> 00:44:28,291
Aren't you going to Bihu?

288
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:30,041
No

289
00:44:30,041 --> 00:44:31,750
Why don't you study then?

290
00:45:22,041 --> 00:45:29,125
Now presenting to you
Tarun Sangha's Bihu Performance

291
00:47:36,666 --> 00:47:37,958
Maina

292
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:41,541
Maina

293
00:47:45,541 --> 00:47:46,625
Maina

294
00:48:04,791 --> 00:48:06,791
What are you doing locked up inside?

295
00:48:07,208 --> 00:48:08,625
Sleeping.

296
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:24,333
I want to live here... with you.

297
00:48:24,333 --> 00:48:27,208
Why would your parents let you?

298
00:48:33,625 --> 00:48:35,750
Let's get married?

299
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:43,208
How? We'll be sent to jail

300
00:48:47,333 --> 00:48:53,375
These days many alter their bodies
I want to get operated and become a girl

301
00:48:53,375 --> 00:48:57,625
You'll have to put up a huge fight, Maina.

302
00:48:57,625 --> 00:49:01,625
Your family and the villagers won't understand

303
00:49:03,208 --> 00:49:05,750
I'll go to the city and work hard

304
00:49:06,833 --> 00:49:11,250
I'll save, get operated, and become a girl

305
00:49:13,833 --> 00:49:16,458
You'll need more money
than you think for the operation

306
00:49:17,583 --> 00:49:18,708
I'll manage

307
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:24,041
The outside world isn't as easy as you think

308
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:27,791
Anything is easier than dying everyday

309
00:49:30,625 --> 00:49:33,125
What are we discussing today?

310
00:49:33,125 --> 00:49:34,166
Tense

311
00:49:34,791 --> 00:49:37,708
Do you remember the basics of Tense?

312
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:38,791
Yes

313
00:49:38,791 --> 00:49:39,958
Good

314
00:49:39,958 --> 00:49:41,916
Take out your copy and pen

315
00:49:45,458 --> 00:49:46,625
Are you okay?

316
00:49:47,041 --> 00:49:48,416
I am not feeling well

317
00:49:49,041 --> 00:49:50,458
Is it bad?

318
00:49:50,458 --> 00:49:51,333
Umm

319
00:49:51,916 --> 00:49:52,750
let me...

320
00:49:54,125 --> 00:49:55,291
You want to go home?

321
00:49:55,583 --> 00:49:56,250
Umm

322
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,416
Let me ask someone to drop you.

323
00:49:59,416 --> 00:50:00,666
I can go by myself.

324
00:50:00,666 --> 00:50:01,875
Are you sure?

325
00:50:01,875 --> 00:50:02,458
Umm

326
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,625
Okay. Take care.

327
00:53:42,666 --> 00:53:44,000
Where is Mother?

328
00:53:44,625 --> 00:53:46,166
Hungry already?

329
00:53:46,166 --> 00:53:48,500
I want to sleep. Not feeling well

330
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,333
What's wrong?

331
00:53:49,333 --> 00:53:50,666
Nothing.

332
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:52,958
Why don't you tell me?

333
00:53:52,958 --> 00:53:54,750
I am lying on your bed.

334
00:53:55,625 --> 00:53:57,750
How will I know if you don't tell me?

335
00:54:04,416 --> 00:54:12,958
Tell me. What is it?

336
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:19,833
Why are you like a man?

337
00:54:21,833 --> 00:54:24,416
You too have a problem with me now?

338
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:29,333
Why aren't you like the other girls?

339
00:54:30,083 --> 00:54:32,000
Is that why you're sick?

340
00:54:32,833 --> 00:54:36,750
No, but why hide yourself?

341
00:54:38,958 --> 00:54:41,750
I have nothing to hide
I live like I am.

342
00:54:42,583 --> 00:54:44,750
That's not true! I know everything

343
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:47,500
I know why you don't want to get married

344
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:49,583
Sleep, if you are sick

345
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:54,041
I am not going to hide myself

346
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,750
Are you all grown-up suddenly?

347
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:03,000
Do what you like, but don't forget mom and dad

348
00:59:16,875 --> 00:59:19,500
What happend? They are inside.

349
00:59:23,125 --> 00:59:25,750
Pinky...

350
00:59:27,416 --> 00:59:29,250
He is here to meet you

351
00:59:30,125 --> 00:59:33,750
What?

352
00:59:37,416 --> 00:59:38,583
What do you want?

353
00:59:38,583 --> 00:59:40,666
I've come to meet you

354
00:59:40,666 --> 00:59:42,458
Me? Why?

355
00:59:44,166 --> 00:59:45,333
Come inside?

356
00:59:45,333 --> 00:59:48,041
Quick! I need to go out for some work

357
00:59:48,041 --> 00:59:49,166
Please come

358
00:59:53,916 --> 00:59:55,041
Let him sit

359
00:59:56,291 --> 01:00:01,000
Sit down

360
01:00:02,625 --> 01:00:05,125
Who told you I live here?

361
01:00:06,791 --> 01:00:07,416
At the shop...

362
01:00:07,416 --> 01:00:08,625
I see

363
01:00:08,958 --> 01:00:11,416
Why are you here? What's the matter?

364
01:00:11,416 --> 01:00:13,541
I've come to meet you

365
01:00:14,416 --> 01:00:15,375
I get it.

366
01:00:16,041 --> 01:00:19,416
What is it you want from me so badly?

367
01:00:20,208 --> 01:00:22,833
I saw you at the shop that day...

368
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:48,916
Nibi...

369
01:01:54,250 --> 01:01:55,583
How are you, now?

370
01:01:55,875 --> 01:01:56,708
What are you doing?

371
01:01:57,041 --> 01:01:59,625
Nothing. I was going to see you home.

372
01:02:01,291 --> 01:02:03,416
Are you really that sick?

373
01:02:03,958 --> 01:02:06,583
Don't tell anyone at home
that I didn't go to school

374
01:02:06,583 --> 01:02:08,833
Why? Where did you go?

375
01:02:09,708 --> 01:02:12,208
And don't tell them that
I left school early yesterday

376
01:02:12,208 --> 01:02:14,000
I don't understand.

377
01:02:14,458 --> 01:02:18,333
I was unwell, so I bunked
without telling anyone at home

378
01:02:18,333 --> 01:02:22,416
My brother will thrash me if he finds out.

379
01:02:22,416 --> 01:02:24,208
Where did you go then?

380
01:02:24,208 --> 01:02:26,291
Just roamed around

381
01:02:26,291 --> 01:02:29,541
Despite being unwell

382
01:02:30,708 --> 01:02:34,625
We also have to tell Liku. Let's call her

383
01:02:41,458 --> 01:02:43,416
Did Baba eat?

384
01:02:43,416 --> 01:02:44,333
Umm

385
01:02:44,875 --> 01:02:49,791
These two ate, but not Maina

386
01:02:50,291 --> 01:02:54,416
Says he's unwell but has no signs of fever or flu.

387
01:02:55,083 --> 01:02:57,708
It's the sudden weather change.

388
01:02:58,875 --> 01:03:00,833
He should drink more water.

389
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:50,541
Did you take the cows out?

390
01:06:17,041 --> 01:06:18,666
Please leave!

391
01:06:19,833 --> 01:06:21,458
What is all this that you've started?

392
01:06:21,958 --> 01:06:23,541
I'm very upset with you, Maina

393
01:06:23,541 --> 01:06:25,333
Why are you so scared?

394
01:06:25,333 --> 01:06:28,083
I'm scared. You just go

395
01:06:28,083 --> 01:06:31,583
Will you marry me
if an operation makes me a girl?

396
01:06:31,583 --> 01:06:33,666
I love you the way you are.

397
01:06:35,250 --> 01:06:36,666
But I can't

398
01:06:38,458 --> 01:06:41,750
You're too young to realise it

399
01:06:42,833 --> 01:06:47,625
but I know what it's like to be an outcast

400
01:06:48,166 --> 01:06:50,166
It's different in the big cities

401
01:06:50,166 --> 01:06:54,541
It's stupid to think that it's the same
in a small village like ours in Assam

402
01:06:54,541 --> 01:06:58,500
Yet you won't fight the society!

403
01:06:58,500 --> 01:06:59,541
Wow!

404
01:06:59,791 --> 01:07:01,416
What a love story early in the morning!

405
01:07:02,375 --> 01:07:04,125
The village will be on fire today

406
01:07:04,708 --> 01:07:07,041
Because of you I'll have to leave this place too

407
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:08,750
You don't have to.

408
01:07:10,541 --> 01:07:14,916
Lady, wait!
You're today's breaking news!

409
01:07:14,916 --> 01:07:18,083
Has he drilled your hole?

410
01:07:19,083 --> 01:07:23,791
Lady! You sisterfucker!
I will parade you naked in the village

411
01:07:46,083 --> 01:07:47,541
What's happening?

412
01:07:47,541 --> 01:07:51,833
I caught this lady red-handed
doing dirty things with the psycho Palash!

413
01:08:01,041 --> 01:08:02,458
Lady, wait!

414
01:08:03,041 --> 01:08:04,125
What happend?

415
01:08:04,125 --> 01:08:06,750
Lady was doing dirty things with Palash psycho!

416
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:10,250
Have you heard? Lady was doing
obscene things with that Psycho!

417
01:08:10,708 --> 01:08:11,916
Come with me

418
01:08:14,916 --> 01:08:16,541
Where were you?

419
01:08:25,083 --> 01:08:25,750
What's happening?

420
01:08:25,750 --> 01:08:26,833
Uncle, come

421
01:08:27,875 --> 01:08:28,625
what happend exactly?

422
01:08:28,625 --> 01:08:30,250
It's a shame for the village!

423
01:08:30,250 --> 01:08:32,541
Lady was doing dirty things with Palash psycho

424
01:08:32,541 --> 01:08:35,541
I knew it already.
Why didn't you tell if you knew?

425
01:08:45,375 --> 01:08:46,416
What's this noise?

426
01:08:46,416 --> 01:08:49,458
Your brother was caught messing
with Palash-psycho early morning

427
01:09:00,125 --> 01:09:04,333
Please leave. We'll look into it later

428
01:09:11,791 --> 01:09:15,291
We will discuss with the village elders later

429
01:09:24,833 --> 01:09:28,625
Baba, don't

430
01:09:35,583 --> 01:09:37,500
Baba please wait!

431
01:09:38,333 --> 01:09:41,083
Are you crazy?
You don't even know if they're telling the truth

432
01:09:41,083 --> 01:09:42,958
These guys keep bothering Maina

433
01:09:42,958 --> 01:09:46,125
Jumu! He'll be back
Come, please. Let everything cool down first

434
01:09:46,125 --> 01:09:49,291
I will cut you into pieces
if you let him come home again

435
01:10:17,291 --> 01:10:18,625
Lady, wait!

436
01:10:39,208 --> 01:10:41,875
You're not ashamed to suck that psycho's dick...

437
01:10:41,875 --> 01:10:44,708
but are when you are caught

438
01:10:45,625 --> 01:10:47,833
You Bastard!

439
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:19,666
Don't dare tell anyone

440
01:11:19,666 --> 01:11:20,708
Who will he tell?

441
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,750
Everyone knows about him and Palash.

442
01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:25,333
You'll face the village trial today

443
01:11:34,916 --> 01:11:36,083
Where are you going?

444
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:38,958
Leave him.
People may come. We need to go

445
01:11:39,375 --> 01:11:40,791
He might go to the police

446
01:11:40,791 --> 01:11:45,291
Let him. He can't do anything.
No one will believe him

447
01:11:45,291 --> 01:11:48,083
Everyone knows already

448
01:13:20,041 --> 01:13:21,791
You must take a Guru

449
01:13:22,333 --> 01:13:25,250
I can't change the rules just for you

450
01:13:25,833 --> 01:13:30,125
Bablu will take you to Munni, my guru

451
01:13:33,958 --> 01:13:36,125
I want to go to a big city and work

452
01:13:36,958 --> 01:13:40,791
Munni will help you with everything.
She knows people.

453
01:13:40,791 --> 01:13:45,416
Stay with her in Guwahati for a few days
and do as she says

454
01:14:14,833 --> 01:14:16,458
As-salamu alaikum

455
01:14:19,541 --> 01:14:20,750
Ram Ram

456
01:14:25,583 --> 01:14:26,333
Wake up

457
01:14:26,333 --> 01:14:29,291
We need to perform the ceremony for the disciple

458
01:15:18,333 --> 01:15:20,708
Clap everyone...

459
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:39,541
Bless you, daughter. Serve the sweets

460
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:48,750
Feed everyone with your own hands

461
01:18:37,375 --> 01:18:38,541
Sister

462
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:43,250
This is all because of the tobacco

463
01:18:43,750 --> 01:18:45,291
Let me know what you plan

464
01:18:46,250 --> 01:18:48,166
I'll send you some money

465
01:18:49,375 --> 01:18:51,166
Don't tell brother

466
01:18:51,875 --> 01:18:53,916
It's better if we take him to Mumbai

467
01:18:56,083 --> 01:18:58,125
I'll be there from the 15th

468
01:18:58,541 --> 01:19:02,083
If possible, bring dad here to my home

469
01:19:03,458 --> 01:19:05,208
The flight is in the evening..

470
01:19:05,208 --> 01:19:06,625
No, don't bring brother

471
01:19:06,625 --> 01:19:09,083
We book two more tickets and leave together

472
01:19:10,583 --> 01:19:12,166
I know a lot of people in Mumbai

473
01:19:14,083 --> 01:19:14,750
ok

474
01:19:15,166 --> 01:19:16,875
Let me know your decision by tomorrow

475
01:19:30,208 --> 01:19:31,166
Where are you going?

476
01:19:31,708 --> 01:19:34,583
As I am renting out my flat,
I'm checking if everything is okay

477
01:19:34,583 --> 01:19:36,916
Giving it on rent or free for your lover boy?

478
01:19:36,916 --> 01:19:40,125
You'll find out. I'll tell them to pay the rent to you

479
01:19:40,125 --> 01:19:42,500
Look, your lover boy has his wife and children.

480
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:45,375
His interest in you lies only in getting to fuck you.

481
01:19:45,375 --> 01:19:46,625
Do you understand?

482
01:19:46,625 --> 01:19:50,375
Why keep coming from Mumbai
to fulfill his sexual needs

483
01:21:09,250 --> 01:21:14,000
You can't cower in a closed room in fear of your parents.
How will you earn then?

484
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,208
There's a customer expected in the evening.
Make him happy

485
01:21:50,958 --> 01:21:52,791
Hello

486
01:21:59,875 --> 01:22:01,416
I'm coming.

487
01:22:36,750 --> 01:22:41,375
Getting easy money by dressing like a woman,
Isn't that all you need in life?

488
01:22:41,375 --> 01:22:42,041
Isn't it?

489
01:22:42,041 --> 01:22:44,708
Not everyone. One must be shameless to do so.

490
01:22:48,791 --> 01:22:52,083
Take off your blouse

491
01:22:54,333 --> 01:22:56,333
Open it

492
01:22:56,875 --> 01:23:00,083
You have no shame in being a eunuch
Then why be coy in taking off your clothes?

493
01:23:02,166 --> 01:23:03,583
Why don't you open his blouse?

494
01:23:03,583 --> 01:23:06,958
Mr Newly Married, you must be
really getting it on with the wife

495
01:23:07,333 --> 01:23:10,291
Does she let you? Or does she have someone else?

496
01:23:10,291 --> 01:23:13,791
This one's too much in love. Even cooks for her

497
01:23:13,791 --> 01:23:17,583
Because of men like you,
women have forgotten their place

498
01:23:17,583 --> 01:23:23,041
Look at me. My wife shivers in fear
the moment I step inside the house

499
01:23:23,041 --> 01:23:27,000
I earn the money. All she has to do is eat, manage the
household and take her clothes off at night. Simple!

500
01:23:27,708 --> 01:23:29,875
What happened? Open!

501
01:23:33,083 --> 01:23:37,333
You are useless.
You open it

502
01:23:42,791 --> 01:23:46,041
What a bra!

503
01:23:49,583 --> 01:23:51,708
Where are your mangoes?

504
01:23:55,833 --> 01:23:58,625
You son of a bitch!
Couldn't you get another job?

505
01:23:59,333 --> 01:24:01,250
Not all hijras have breasts

506
01:24:02,125 --> 01:24:02,666
What?

507
01:24:03,541 --> 01:24:05,916
Breasts don't matter

508
01:24:07,041 --> 01:24:10,541
How do you know?
Did you marry a girl or hijra?

509
01:24:11,875 --> 01:24:14,458
I'm only kidding

510
01:24:16,541 --> 01:24:19,875
Anyway, I don't care what you are

511
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:25,916
Pay either of us,
whoever you meet on the road, 200 rupees daily

512
01:24:25,916 --> 01:24:29,166
If you miss a day, you pay double the next day

513
01:26:16,875 --> 01:26:20,750
Oh Maina...

514
01:26:22,750 --> 01:26:26,125
Where did you go?

515
01:26:28,291 --> 01:26:36,125
You father couldn't stop thinking of you...
It killed him.

516
01:26:45,041 --> 01:26:48,583
He refused to eat without you.
He couldn't sleep

517
01:26:48,583 --> 01:26:52,250
He worried about you till death..

518
01:26:54,000 --> 01:27:00,208
Where did you go, Maina?

519
01:27:16,208 --> 01:27:17,333
Where is sister?

520
01:27:17,333 --> 01:27:19,458
At the crematorium

521
01:27:19,458 --> 01:27:23,500
The villagers tried to prevent her
but she didn't listen

522
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:26,041
Don't go there. It'll make things worse

523
01:27:31,125 --> 01:27:37,750
Don't ever leave us again
Live the way you want. But stay here with us

524
01:27:37,750 --> 01:27:41,958
I'll make your brother understand

525
01:27:54,583 --> 01:27:57,500
It's best that you don't stay here any longer

526
01:27:57,500 --> 01:27:58,333
Why?

527
01:27:58,666 --> 01:28:03,875
The village elders will decide by tomorrow

528
01:28:03,875 --> 01:28:09,708
But they shouldn't refuse
to come today because of you

529
01:28:09,708 --> 01:28:12,375
And you never know how your brother will react

530
01:28:39,250 --> 01:28:41,250
Give this to mother

531
01:28:43,833 --> 01:28:46,083
Let's meet when I come to Guwahati.

532
01:28:46,083 --> 01:28:47,125
I'll call you

533
01:28:47,125 --> 01:28:48,083
Umm

534
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:51,458
Liku lives in Guwahati now

535
01:28:51,458 --> 01:28:53,125
I've met her

536
01:29:04,166 --> 01:29:05,875
Goodbye...

537
01:29:37,750 --> 01:29:41,458
Maina!
