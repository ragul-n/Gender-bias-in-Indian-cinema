00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:42,333
Why the light is on there?

3
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:01,853
Unable to sleep due to
excitement of...

4
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:03,695
... of getting released
tomorrow?

5
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:08,023
Be seated. Tell me
what is going on your mind?

6
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:11,696
Nothing. l'm here for 5 years.

7
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:15,541
l think my sister must be
having atleast 2 kids by now.

8
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,544
l'm thinking of nice
suitable names for them.

9
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,212
Do you think they are
not christened as yet!

10
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:23,871
No. My sister won't do it
without my presence.

11
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:26,878
What names have you
thought of?

12
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:30,051
You tell me.
-Me! - Yes.

13
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:33,384
These are names for boys,
these, for girls.

14
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,724
Choose one from each.

15
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:49,070
Now from this lot.

16
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:54,042
Shanti!
lt is my mother's name.

17
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,039
Your mother's name! - Yes.

18
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:59,748
Had your mother chosen
names for you like this?

19
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,049
No. - Then?

20
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,595
My son's name is
Shivaramakrishna

21
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,760
Daughter's name is Sri.

22
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,064
Offer 'Archana' in
their names.

23
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:23,067
Mother you told me that
you are taking me to father.

24
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,068
We are going there now.

25
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,945
You are leaving without
breaking the coconut!

26
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,947
l forgot.

27
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:38,950
My mother used to say a
rotten coconut is a bad omen.

28
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,627
lt happened so that day.

29
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,091
My father got married
the second time.

30
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,965
When my mother questioned,
he replied that...

31
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,106
... he lost interest in her
and threw money at her.-Go.

32
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:05,651
She cried all day for being
cheated in marriage...

33
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:10,652
... holding us close.

34
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,887
Those were her last words.

35
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,660
Who is she? - My mother.
She is dead, sir.

36
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,684
l take your leave.
-Okay.

37
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:45,186
What's this? A grave
in the middle of a farm?

38
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,518
lt is their farm.
So they built it.

39
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,527
Of course not. Their mother
took loan from us against it.

40
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,693
Village court permitted us
to confiscate it against it.

41
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:59,535
We don't like a grave in the
middle of farm. Break it.

42
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:03,702
Sir, l'll repay the loan.
Don't break mother's grave.

43
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,539
He promises to repay.
Give him one chance.

44
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,381
Their father had deserted
them. Mother is dead.

45
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,178
He is just a kid.
How can he repay?

46
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,388
He will cultivate the farm.
-He can!

47
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,558
l'll do it, sir.
l'll repay your loan.

48
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,890
lf he couldn't, l'll repay.

49
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:26,387
Okay l agree. l want
it on yearly basis.

50
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,568
You mean in installments.
-Whatever it means.-Sir...

51
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:21,014
Mother used to say
those stars are us.

52
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,851
Your sister will pass
out in 1st class.

53
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:39,750
Has God said so, sir?

54
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,386
Trust my words.
Break the coconut.

55
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,269
l hope the best happens.

56
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,273
There is a flower in it!

57
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,605
Good! 1st class is confirmed!

58
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:09,947
Sister...

59
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,293
Gouri, give me back my pen.
-Here it is.

60
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,434
What is this?

61
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:46,487
Be careful.

62
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:48,150
Madam, here are your books.

63
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:49,828
Be careful.

64
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,663
You knew she will drop if
you warn her. - l knew.

65
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,462
l'm going to exam. Don't
need books. Keep them in.

66
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:02,504
Take them. You get better
marks if you copy.

67
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,343
Come on, brother!
Let's move. - Okay.

68
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,680
Do your best. Must
get good marks. - Sure.

69
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,009
Why not you accompany her!
-Why do you say so?

70
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,345
You told her so,
so many times that...

71
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,681
... she might reproduce
your words than the answers.

72
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,684
She is beautiful! Got into
the next compartment. Let's go.

73
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,356
Let's go.
-Get in.

74
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,368
Where is he gone!

75
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:36,202
You look beautiful
in this dress.

76
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:40,375
What's your name?
Amala? Vimala?

77
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:44,872
Kamala or Pramila

78
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:54,386
Good songs. - Voice is
sweet too. Want to hear?

79
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,892
Not now.
lsn't teasing girls wrong?

80
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:03,732
l'll do as l please.
Who are you to question me?

81
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:08,237
Look at this. l'll kill
you if you interfere.

82
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,404
Have you finished talking?

83
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,538
Brother, he slapped you!

84
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:28,483
Play now.

85
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,159
l lose again. But
l'll defeat you someday.

86
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:40,496
l'm waiting for the day
you defeat my son.

87
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,830
Greetings.-Be seated.l heard
that your sister is giving exam.

89
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,505
Brother, buttermilk for you.

90
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:00,348
Move aside.
-You are at it again!

91
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:04,512
Those stars are...
-Mother used to say so,

92
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:08,849
That's you and me. , right?
-Yes.

93
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,859
Will one of them disappear if
she leaves you after marriage?

94
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:16,933
She won't go anywhere.
l'll bring the groom here.

95
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,204
May l take the eggs
to fair tomorrow?

96
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:24,869
Sure, but be careful.

97
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,706
l told him to be
careful, not her.

98
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:32,710
You are always dropping
things. Only twice a day.

99
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,045
Greetings, Krishna s - Greetings.

100
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,547
What brings you here
at this hour?

101
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:40,886
l've brought an alliance
after short listing.

102
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,056
From which place?

103
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,055
From Nujiweedu. His
grandpa is a landlord there.

104
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,224
Does he have a own house?
-He has a bungalow.

105
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,896
What about a car?
-They have 4 cars.

106
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,565
That means the boy is in US

107
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,566
He is a green card holder.

108
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,573
He'll take his wife immediately
after wedding l suppose.

109
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,738
By flight. You spoke as if
you heard them saying it.

110
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,737
l don't want this alliance.
-Why?

111
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,743
Others jump at this offer.
You seem disappointed.

112
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:06,084
l don't want a prince...

113
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:10,244
... but someone who takes
care of her, right here.

114
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:48,960
Hi, Santosh, it's me, dad.

115
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:50,958
What are you doing?

116
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:57,299
l can hear it. l told you
many times to take me too.

117
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,137
You are being selfish.

118
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,643
l know you can hear me.

119
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,973
Don't use the trick on me which
you use when mother scolds you.

120
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:14,812
Okay, enjoy the
party thoroughly.

121
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,986
He can hear this perfectly.

122
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,658
l heard that you donated
to London royal orphanage.

123
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,667
lt's not a big amount.

124
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,164
10,000 pounds isn't a
big amount.

125
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,337
But you could use it for public
relations like throwing a party.

126
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,670
That would help expand
our business.

127
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,179
But it's an orphanage...

128
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,677
There are many to accept
donations.

129
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:52,016
But don't do such useless
things. l don't like it.

130
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,857
Why are you in bad mood?

131
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:03,864
l'm your best friend

132
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:08,703
Did mother scold you?

133
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,377
For not asking if she hit me.

134
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,380
You know mother well.
Why do you get upset?

135
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,875
l'm not upset.
Do you know onething?

136
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:19,877
Socrates became a
great man becuase of...

137
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,552
... his tolerance
towards his wife.

138
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,049
l'm not talking about you
but of Socrates wife.

139
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,228
Brother-in-law, l'm
Srinivasarao from lndia.

140
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:34,722
l'm somehow getting along
with your sister.

141
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:36,897
That is not new.

142
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,232
lt's your brother
from lndia.

143
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,899
How are you brother?
What's the news?

144
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:45,903
Lot of news. On coming 1 4th
is Lalith's engagement.

145
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:50,745
She is in love. l objected.
She cried and l gave in.

146
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,914
Love! ls the groom rich?

147
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:58,249
That is why l conceded.
You must come for marriage...

148
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,089
... and handle it.
Tell my brother-in-law.

149
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,095
Aunty, l'm Lalli.

150

Bring Santosh along.
l've seen him as a kid.

152
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,097
Okay.

153
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,105
You are not coming.
-Why?

154
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,774
You have a conference to
attend in US, forgot?

155
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:28,783
Stop the car here.

156
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,791
How are you, dear?
-Chocolate for you, brother.

157
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,624
So, you have not forgotten
to give us chocolates.

158
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,129
Welcome, to the bride.

162
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,310
2 days early! No.

163
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,810
Now! - Of course. How early

164
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,647
-l don't know. Ask brother
-You

165
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:06,157
You tell me how many days

Atleast 15 days before
the wedding. - Right.

167
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:09,987
My wedding is 15 days

Please send her with me.

Same with her too.
But you have to send her.

Aren't you a darling?

172
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:26,841
Please, brother.

173
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,509
Do you want to go?

174
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,012
l won't you if you say so.

175
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,180
Go.

176
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:51,358
Has the rabbit from the
moon landed on the earth?

177
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,698
ls that you it changed into?
-Appears so.

178
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:59,203
The glitter in the
stars loved you

179
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,869
ls their shine blended
into you? - Appears so.

180
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,978
Has the path followed you
like a smooth sailing boat..

181
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,987
..or it became smooth
by itself?

182
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,021
What is it?

183
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,888
Or changed it's
course because of you?

184
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:20,729
Did the land change its course
because of you and turned a river?

185
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:11,279
Oh prime youth! you have arrived!

186
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,951
Do you know where to land?

187
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,785
You have brought
joy along but

188
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:21,950
.... do you know
whom to gift it to?

189
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:07,327
ls it a new form of
Kuchipudi dance?

190
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:11,168
Have your tender feet
taught you this?

191
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:15,335
Has the folk form has
stepped out of villages...?

192
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:19,176
... lnfluenced by the
modern culture?

193
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:25,854
Hidden feelings have
come out in the verses of song

194
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:34,195
The tunes reveal the
hidden thoughts

195
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:55,379
With little torments
and like the unstoppable haste

196
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:59,045
..how long will this journey continue?

197
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,385
ls this a plan ahead for tomorrow?

198
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:07,054
Why is there such a haste?

199
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:11,396
lf you ask for the distance
between sky and earth..

200
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,401
..the wings would disappear!

201
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:19,399
lf you ask for the shore to make them one ...

202
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,909
..directions would shudder!

203
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,930
Santosh, here is a big
bouquet for you. lt's me...

204
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,101
Do you recognise me?

205
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,796
She isn't a beauty but a beast.
She is our distant relative

206
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:22,970
l'm her close relative

207
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,979
l heard that even vegetable
venders in US speak English.

208
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,985
ls it true?
-You have improved a lot.

209
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,324
Do you have mosquitoes here?
-How many do you want?

210
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,820
Are there no mosquitoes in
London? - No.

211
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,992
That means London has
not developed yet.

212
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,658
Don't worry. You can carry a
suitcaseful when you return.

213
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:02,839
Who is that girl?

214
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:48,893
l came all the way from
London for you and you...

215
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,721
... don't even come to
receive me at the airport.

216
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,060
You are so beautiful!

217
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,562
l'd marry you had
l known it.

218
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,736
Do you remember my mischief
as a kid?

219
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,736
l won't get a chance once you
are married. Do l do it now?

220
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:08,238
l'm not Lalita.
-What! - l'm her friend.

221
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,247
Why didn't you tell me
this for so long?

222
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,914
-Those anklets.... - lt is
normal to err at this age.

223
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,412
You don't have to apologise

224
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,094
-She is... - l know,
she is your friend.

225
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:28,262
l mistook her for you and...

226
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,604
-She hates such things.
-What does she like?

227
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,271
l'm coming.
Let's go.

228
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,440
Santosh! My foot!

229
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,611
What's your name? l know
you won't tell me. My name is...

230
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:51,451
l came from London.

231
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,952
Generally people here have bad
opinion about boys from foreign.

232
00:24:55,660 --> 00:25:01,621
That they are romeos
and are con men.

233
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:02,629
ls it?

234
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:08,299
You have heard right.
l'm such a boy so beware.

235
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,816
Where is Sugar? Go get it.
-Oh, God!

236
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,147
Why did you get startled?

237
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:24,311
l thought it is that monkey
again. - Which monkey?

238
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,151
The monkey from London.

239
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,821
Oh, that boy!
He grew up in London.

240
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,327
Not everyone from London
is like that.

241
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:36,493
lt's not him but his parents
upbringing that should be blamed.

242
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,164
Don't shut me up. l'll give
them a lesson if l meet them.

243
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:44,334
Am l not right? - Do you
know whom are you asking?

244
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:49,510
She is her new aunty.
-That money is her son.

245
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:08,695
Sugar is too less.

246
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,211
who is it?

247
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,548
My name is JP.

248
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:31,055
Unfortunately l'm your friend
and business partner.

249
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,053
What makes you be angry at
me so early morning?

250
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,226
Of course. lt's your
daughter's engagement.

251
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:36,390
Wedding is close too.

252
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:39,389
Don't you know to assign
me some responsibilities?

253
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,400
Pack up and come here...

254
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,566
... with the family.

255
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:02,753
l got the news from kitchen
that you called me a monkey.

256
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,090
No. l said London monkey.
-Why?

257
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,588
Sorry, l should have called
you a guerrilla.

258
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,424
Who called me?

259
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,769
Move aside? - Which way?
-Upstairs.

260
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,107
Okay... Okay.

261
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:48,128
This is my sister.
-Greetings.

262
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,960
He is JP, my partner in
construction business.

263
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,629
Served 20 years in Central
ministry. He is an Andhraite.

264
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,475
Who is that boy?
-My nephew from London.

265
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,307
lntroduce me to him.
-l'll. Don't hurry.

266
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,160
lndia is full of long
skirts and half sarees.

267
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,172
What are you doing
in my room?

268
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,013
This isn't your room.
Get out.

269
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,847
l came into
your room by mistake.

270
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,857
Hope you have not
seen anything.

271
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,030
Don't touch it.
l won't like it.

272
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,201
Give it to me.

273
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,218
lt's given to me
by my brother.

274
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:20,720
Your brother gave it?

275
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:35,902
Go away.

276
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:45,082
l'm teasing you every day.
Any other girl would..

277
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,418
..have slapped me.

278
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,584
But you didn't.
Does that mean...

279
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:10,941
-You aren't wearing a towel.
-Now you aren't.

280
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:15,442
l never expected someone
to fall for me.

281
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,776
Now...

282
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,444
Either laugh and speak or do vice versa

283
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:28,955
lt's someone like you.
Calls up but never speaks.

284
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:32,459
That boy from London
is so charming.

285
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:36,622
Come to the point. - He and
my daughter are a good match.

286
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:41,302
Your mediation can
unite them.

287
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:47,305
My sister will fume.
But l'll handle her.

288
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,814
You tell your daughter
to befriend him.

289
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:57,215
My daughter just
needs a signal.

290
00:30:59,023 --> 00:30:59,819
She will go to any
lengths to...

291
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,009
Why did you put it there?

292
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:27,685
That's the only
place l've for it.

293
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:33,182
Whom are you sending e-mail?
-To my dad.

294
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:36,857
Do you love your dad?- Why?
Won't you love your dad?

295
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,189
l love him as much as l
love 'halwa' (a sweet)

296
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:41,528
l love 'halwa' too.

297
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,534
What do you want to make?
-'Halwa'.

298
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:46,703
Why do you take trouble?
l will prepare it.

299
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,373
Never mind.
You mind your work.

300
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,871
For whom? - For the
person whom l like.

301
00:31:58,583 --> 00:31:59,379
How do you know?

302
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,218
That is salt!

303
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:13,060
That is... - Salt!
-You mind your work.

304
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:29,909
She is going to feed him!

305
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:32,909
Mind your business.

306
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:35,915
What is this twist?

307
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,090
You said you love it.
l made it for you.

308
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,253
So, besides milk, sugar,
cashewnuts and raisins,

309
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:44,925
... l put in kisses too.

310
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:50,427
'Salt and camphor look alike
but taste different.'

311
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:56,763
Take my advice.

312
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:58,768
Don't eat it.

313
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:06,116
Hi son-in-law. - Yes, uncle.
-Have you eaten it?

314
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:07,781
Looks like my
daughter made it.

315
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,617
You eat it first.
-No, you eat it.

316
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:14,450
For my sake, please eat.
-How courteous!

317
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:24,799
ls it tasty, daddy?
l cannot describe how tasty.

318
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:27,471
What are you doing, rascal?

319
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,466
Don't eat it all.
Keep some for Santosh.

320
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,973
lt cannot be for only for
two of you. Give me some.

321
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:35,645
Why not? lt is all yours.

322
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:40,310
Oh! lt's full of cashewnuts,
raisins! You're a true friend.

323
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,320
Not just in business
but by heart too.

324
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:49,485
Tasty? l think salt
is a bit in excess.

325
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:54,323
My foot, you...

326
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:57,330
l'll come wait

327
00:33:57,535 --> 00:34:01,835
What happened?- You try
something other than cooking.

328
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:09,502
Making 'halwa' isn't your
cup of tea.- Then whose else?

329
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:15,675
lt's me, the girl who
came for Lalli's wedding.

330
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,021
lt's me

331
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:23,858
l washed that saree
and this blouse.

332
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:31,201
lt belongs to that monkey
without a tail from London.

333
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,201
l'll deal with you

334
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:45,883
You dare tease me!
You and your messy hair!

335
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:48,047
You!

336
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,565
l hate the name Santosh.

337
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:09,399
l swear on my brother

338
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:27,918
''lt's me... lt's me.''

339
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:31,925
Where?

340
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:40,934
Has Santosh come here?
-l don't know. He isn't there.

341
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:46,607
You naughty!
You are here! - No. Here.

342
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:50,440
My friends are
coming the evening.

343
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:54,110
Go no where. l want to
introduce them to you.

344
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:58,619
She is Nimmi, she is Anita,
Sarita, Avita and she is lndu.

345
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:02,451
This is my shorts, this is
sandal and this is fruit peel.

346
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:06,793
Have it. - Give me.
l'll give it to Santosh.

347
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,126
Where are you going?
You work all the time.

348
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,303
l didn't make it.
That's why he thanked.

349
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,809
Do you want me to come.
-Have it.

350
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:23,639
What was l saying?
-About Santosh.

351
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:28,307
His father is one of the top
500 millionaires in London.

352
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:31,154
Has a huge mansion,
100 acres of estate,...

353
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:35,986
...4 Benz cars, a software
company and a chartered plane.

354
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,988
This is only half of it.
-You have no less.

355
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,492
Yes. My father has
100 crore property.

356
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,835
-What else does he have?
-You

357
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:46,165
May be nothing

358
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:49,669
What was l saying?
-About Santosh.

359
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,672
Santosh is a millionaire.
l'm a millionaire.

360
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,671
Everyone here is
a millionaire.

361
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:01,351
l'm a millionaire too.

362
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,018
Really! How much
money do you have?

363
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,191
A small house in my village.
10 acres of farms.

364
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,858
4 oxen, 25 cows
and 40 chicken.

365
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:16,021
Above all this, l've a
brother who dotes on me.

366
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,194
That's like millions for me.

367
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:33,212
What are you looking at?

368
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:37,054
l find a new
look in Sri each day.

369
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,722
Your sister has
completed education.

370
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,061
Are you getting her
married this year?

371
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:52,232
l'll if l find a good alliance.
-l've the same problem.

372
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,237
My son completed graduation
in agriculture.

373
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,239
l asked him to go to US
for further studies.

374
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:59,576
But he wanted to stay
back and do farming.

375
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:02,242
Such boys are rare these days.

376
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:05,415
That's why we are
receiving many alliances.

377
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:10,083
But he wants to marry
only your sister.

378
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,583
Do you have any objection?

379
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,928
No, but.
-Want sister's consent?

380
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,764
Yes and l also want to
consult the station master.

381
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:25,595
He is useless except
for giving signals to trains.

382
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:28,601
Trains won't move unless
signal is given.

383
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:32,276
You are head of the village.
l'm head of his family.

384
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:35,942
Trains may come late
but not you. Go ahead.

385
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:40,607
Let the girl come
as you said.

386
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,130
Engagement is an auspicious
occasion. Why to cry?

387
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:57,463
My daughter will go away to
London after marriage.

388
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:58,464
The thought of it is...

389
00:38:59,003 --> 00:38:59,970
You seem to be positive
about it.

390
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:03,132
l've already bought
the tickets.

391
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,808
l'm going to read out
the wedding card.

392
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:15,650
K.Srinivasrao's...
-Who is speaking?

393
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:20,654
You may continue.
-Stop your nonsense.

394
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,493
Why did you stop, pandit?
-He asked me to.

395
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:24,490
Priest, you may proceed.

396
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,332
When will you marry?
-Why do you bother?

397
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,330
l've a friend if
you want to.

398
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,337
He has 10 chicken,
4 oxen and horses too.

399
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:38,838
lt will be a perfect match.

400
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:42,341
What's the time?

401
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:48,177
l've no watch. - You have
no brains either. - l know.

402
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:56,190
Sister, your entry brought
charm to the party.

403
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,188
The lighting is dull
compared to you.

404
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:02,696
Nonsense. Say something else.
-You don't bother.

405
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:08,035
Only one thing is lacking.
-What's that? - This one.

406
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,207
What's this?
-A small necklace.

407
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,203
Must be expensive.
-Costs only 15 lakhs.

408
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:18,712
Buttering up is of no use.

409
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:21,214
This isn't necessary, brother.
-Never mind.

410
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:22,882
l feel so happy looking at them.

411
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:26,052
l feel like puking.

412
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,885
l can't bear it

413
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:35,728
Come with me, Santosh.

414
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:42,398
This is Santosh l speak of,
my boyfriend.

415
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:46,072
Why cannot you come close and
put your hand on my shoulder?

416
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,910
Our eyes met .......
-You pig...

417
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:57,247
2 Pigs met..

418
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:00,083
Really, Lalli?
-No.

419
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:02,922
Nothing

420
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,277
Sri, come here.

421
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,115
Sri, she is Rita,
She is...

422
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:31,780
Chat with them.
l'll be back.

423
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,126
Why do you look
at me like that?

424
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,295
Why do you follow me?

425
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,969
Come aside.
-l won't come.

426
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:53,636
lt's for your sake.
-Please go.

427
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:55,804
What will people think
when they notice us?

428
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:59,149
That's the reason l called you.
-l won't come, that's it.

429
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:00,479
Your blouse hooks
are open.

430
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:04,821
l won't believe you.
You are lying.

431
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,156
You have a mole on your back.

432
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:09,322
Won't believe me even now?

433
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,502
Lalli your friend
is calling you.

434
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,171
One moment.

435
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:29,346
Fix my blouse hooks.

436
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:32,515
l didn't want to wear your
dress. Look what happened.

437
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:33,512
lt's okay.

438
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:40,853
lts done

439
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:48,698
Are you searching for me?
l know you were.

440
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,202
To tell you that you are
a good monkey.

441
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,367
lf the monkey is
seeming good, then..

442
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,206
That shows something
is triggered in you.

443
00:42:58,409 --> 00:42:59,205
Nothing is triggered

444
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:00,933
Everyone feels 'something'

445
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:06,272
Those are inexplicable

446
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:11,106
Even if 'love' is hidden inside ..

447
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:13,614
Even if you say 'no, nothing'

448
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:19,119
Shall l spy, do research and catch you!

449
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:26,960
Come, Come
l have called you thousand times!

450
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:29,632
Listen girl! Come!

451
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:32,461
No response!
Come tomorrow!

452
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:57,320
ls this a new type of dance?

453
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:19,012
Oh family girl! Come
why are you obstinate?

454
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:23,846
Come in front of me
Come dear! this way!

455
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:27,020
Would lend you a hand dear!

456
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:29,852
Why do you doubt me like this?

457
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:35,088
There are no handcuffs
Why do you fear?

458
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:36,696
lf naughtiness knocks your window

459
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:40,361
Don't, yet sleep like this
hidden under a dim cover!

460
00:45:40,804 --> 00:45:43,534
This moment asks to
dance without any fatigue ..

461
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:46,710
..and is a pretentious happy naughtiness!

462
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:07,288
Beneath your sole
this earth has jumped in joy!

463
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:09,959
What a wonder!

464
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:15,462
Has the milk pot in sky
come to your eyes ..

465
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,964
...to sign on this happiness

466
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:20,402
This moment come with me!

467
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:22,305
At a time the dance rhythm syllables ..

468
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:23,633
..drive away, staring at ..

469
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:26,139
You are a glittering star in fright!

470
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:29,141
At this moment when
ecstatic orgies take place

471
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,645
Time would come to a stop!

472
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:31,704
l wrote some love letters to
someone in college days.

473
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:34,369
But kept myself away
on knowing his true colours.

474
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:38,707
He is now blackmails me
to ruin my wedding.

475
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:41,884
He wants her bring money and
jewels to his room else,...

476
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:44,379
... he will distribute the
letters like pamphlets.

477
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:46,556
ls this what you
mean by 'something'?

478
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,559
Only an youngster understands
another youngster's problems.

479
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:51,720
l didn't know whom to tell.
that's why l told you.

480
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:55,561
l know how to extract
those letters from him.

481
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:56,562
This is his house

482
00:48:58,602 --> 00:48:59,398
Seems like he isn't in.

483
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:01,905
Let's get hold of the
letters before he comes.

484
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:07,740
There is a dog.
-Be careful.

485
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:13,746
You go that way.
l'll go this way.

486
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:34,767
l found the letters.

487
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,604
What do we do now?
-Run.

488
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:56,949
You could have closed
the bathroom door.

489
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:58,290
You are responsible for it.

490
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:02,295
You screamed just for
touching you.

491
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,293
No. You are responsible.
-Wait.

492
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:10,469
Give me the shampoo bottle.

493
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:12,475
Want to have bath?

494
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:16,979
What now? - Watch
how it will run away.

495
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:25,485
Oh God!
-This is no ordinary dog.

496
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:29,147
Get down and find
a way to get out.

497
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:33,159
You walk out the door.
The dog will follow you.

498
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,824
l'll follow suit
with the letters.

499
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:37,500
Joking? - Ofcourse not.

500
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:39,168
l'm serious.
-Then you go first.

501
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:42,334
lt will bite you.

502
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:04,360
Keep it on my head!
Take it off.

503
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:06,358
Oh god

504
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:11,864
What do we do now?

505
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:18,701
Sing a song.
-Do l sing so well!

506
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:21,870
No. To make the
dog run away.

507
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:01,751
Look what a stupid
thing you have done.

508
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:09,085
Stop it. l'm getting
wet because of you.

509
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:34,279
lt's my girlfriend.
-l didn't ask you.

510
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,445
l expected you would ask.
-Why do l bother?

511
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:40,949
How many girlfriends
do you have?

512
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,620
1 4, including you.

513
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:46,629
l'm not your girlfriend.

514
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:48,627
Girls always mean the
opposite of what they say.

515
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,626
Then l'm.
-l said the same.

516
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:55,130
Friendship for me is,
helping each other.

517
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:56,464
There were so many youngsters
in the party.

518
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:57,970
But, you chose to
seek my help.

519
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:01,143
Because you considered
me a friend.

520
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:02,641
That makes you a girl friend.

521
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:06,812
Yes, but l don't
mean the other way.

522
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:09,652
Boys and girls have
numerous friends.

523
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:10,979
But one falls in love
with only one.

524
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:12,814
l love a girl.

525
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:15,650
You must be in love with
someone too. Who is it?

526
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:21,827
Shower has stopped.
-Great discovery!

527
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:24,660
Find a way to get out
first. - ldea! - What?

528
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:27,830
l'll make the dog
enter the tub and...

529
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:30,168
...we escape from
the other side.

530
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:33,168
You could have told me much
earlier. - l told you now.

531
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:37,843
Come

532
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:57,195
Give me the letters.

533
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:01,534
Else, l'll shoot you.
-Shoot me.

534
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:05,537
No shooting girls.
-Shoot me.

535
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:08,206
No

536
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:09,875
Please, shoot me.

537
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:16,044
There are no bullets in it.
-l've the gun.

538
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:21,891
How dare you blackmail!

539
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:28,557
Will you trouble girls again?
-No. Don't hit me.

540
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:31,893
What happened?

541
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:33,899
Oh god

542
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:39,067
Give them to her.
We got them.

543
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:50,917
My heart is beating
normally now. Thanks.

544
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:54,757
Thank him.
-No, thank her.

545
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:59,918
He took more trouble than me.
Thank him. - No thank her.

546
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:03,762
Thanks to both of you.
-No need of it between us.

547
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:09,434
l don't mind it.

548
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:12,270
Come

549
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:16,108
l can sleep peacefully now.

550
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:22,451
You called me!

551
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:36,789
Only friends, nothing more.

552
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:54,650
Have juice.

553
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:09,328
l think something broke.
-Glass.

554
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:09,054
ls that toy horse yours?

555
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:12,721
lt broke when the
ball hit it.

556
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:39,411
Your hurt shows how
much you love this toy.

557
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:42,758
My brother gave it to me.

558
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:44,927
lt has been with me
since my childhood.

559
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:48,090
l never thought
l'd lose it.

560
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:58,597
Don't cry. Please.
-l miss my brother.

561
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,628
Counting the stars?

562
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:25,134
l'll also count.

563
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:33,373
l missed the count.

564
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:54,420
lt's the horse your
brother gave you.

565
00:58:56,766 --> 00:58:58,165
l toiled hard to join it

566
00:59:07,644 --> 00:59:10,909
lt has marks of joints
like the moon has a spot.

567
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:13,746
l decorated the horse
to conceal the marks.

568
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:15,844
You may remove them
if you don't like.

569
00:59:17,253 --> 00:59:19,187
lt's nice.
-Really?

570
00:59:22,692 --> 00:59:27,220
You didn't thank me.
So l thanked myself. Bye.

571
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:30,528
Did you call me?

572
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:37,263
Why did you take so much trouble?

573
00:59:38,641 --> 00:59:39,539
Do l tell the truth?

574
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:44,710
l want to see
happiness on your face.

575
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:47,875
That's all?

576
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:51,311
Really?

577
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:54,920
ls there no 'something'?

578
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:48,777
Has the mirror
ever questioned you?

579
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:52,106
That you look different?
l noticed the change in you.

580
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:58,280
That you don't respond
when your name is called

581
01:00:58,421 --> 01:01:01,788
l thought it is strange

582
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:08,119
The shine in your
eyes is my reflection

583
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:12,961
Your lips utter my name

584
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:16,969
l'm convinced of it

585
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:07,353
My every step, automatically
leads to you.

586
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:10,355
They are out of my control

587
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:14,518
Don't fear.
lt's true that...

588
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:20,198
...there is a change in you

589
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:25,200
Who gave you the right to
bring change in me?

590
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:29,534
Ask your heart and
don't blame me

591
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:52,288
Earlier your heart
never beat so fast

592
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:56,458
Don't worry
Ask me

593
01:03:57,667 --> 01:04:01,967
l'll teach you dance steps to match it

594
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:07,041
Why do you fret
when l go away?

595
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:11,473
Control of feelings of love
are not in our hands.

596
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:34,496
Brother...
-What's it?

597
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:36,831
Someone has come in between
you and your sister.

598
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:39,667
Who will come between us?
-Come and see.

599
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:43,007
You must see for yourself.
Look there.

600
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:44,679
l see stars. So what?

601
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:49,341
That's you and Sri. There is
an other star in between.

602
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:56,188
lt must be for a temporary
period. Go, mind your work.

603
01:04:56,325 --> 01:04:59,522
l see. Fine.
lt got me worried.

604
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:02,027
That's Sri and the
other is brother.

605
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:04,529
What are you looking at?

606
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:09,201
Wondering who is in
between those 2 stars.

607
01:05:09,338 --> 01:05:10,362
lt's not you. Go.

608
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:17,368
Do you need spectacles
during wedding ceremony?

609
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:21,705
She will wear even
at bed time.

610
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:25,046
She doesn't need as the
lights will be put off anyway.

611
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:27,222
Look at what she talks
at this age!

612
01:05:27,356 --> 01:05:30,052
All l can do at this
age is, talk.

613
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:19,772
Will you give me a kiss?
-Then what? - l love it.

614
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:21,773
There is still time for it.

615
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:24,112
We have the time now.

616
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:29,447
Don't.

617
01:06:50,506 --> 01:06:51,803
Bless you.

618
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:56,311
Mother, have you ever hit me?

619
01:06:56,445 --> 01:06:58,640
Why will she hit you?
She will hit your father.

620
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:02,984
Why will l hit you?

621
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:08,490
What's wrong with him today?
-Bless them first.

622
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:16,491
Skip it. Have you ever
hit me in life?

623
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:20,499
How can anybody
feel like hitting you?

624
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:24,002
What is the matter?
-Thanks. Let's talk later.

625
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:28,173
No going out of town
once you are made a bride.

626
01:07:28,377 --> 01:07:32,336
Times have changed.
-A custom is a custom anytime.

627
01:07:32,481 --> 01:07:36,008
Eat 'Ariselu' (a sweet)
-Serve me only 2.

628
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:38,345
-What's the matter?
-l'm not hungry.

629
01:07:38,554 --> 01:07:40,181
Didn't he like the food?

630
01:07:40,322 --> 01:07:43,849
lt's not so. He isn't
in good mood since morning.

631
01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:04,034
lt was not intentional
but unexpected.

632
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:09,047
You can kiss me now
if you want.

633
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:14,879
Not just a kiss but
you may do as you wish.

634
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:23,390
Why do you cry?

635
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:26,234
For hurting you.

636
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:28,236
Wipe your tears.

637
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:30,902
Why are you crying?

638
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:34,406
Your tears bring tears
in my eyes. Don't know why.

639
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:38,239
lt's my mistake. Sorry.

640
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:41,416
lt was my mistake.

641
01:08:41,617 --> 01:08:46,577
l shouldn't have done it.
-No. l overreacted.

642
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:49,087
lt's not wrong
with ones beloved.

643
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:51,088
l didn't know what
is right or wrong.

644
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:54,426
How can you know? You were
not born and brought up here.

645
01:08:54,563 --> 01:08:56,087
You should have told
me it was wrong.

646
01:09:20,489 --> 01:09:25,791
l'm so happy.
-Me too.

647
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:30,294
Do you think l don't
know about you both?

648
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:36,134
l was watching you both heading
for marriage during my wedding.

649
01:09:36,338 --> 01:09:39,637
Let me go. - l'll get you
married after my marriage.

650
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:41,472
You...

651
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:54,989
Hurry up before
sir gives green signal.

652
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:57,989
You are working hard as if it's
your own sister's marriage.

653
01:09:58,127 --> 01:10:00,493
l've a sister but
that girl has no brother.

654
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:02,823
l take your leave, sir.
-Master, you forgot this.

655
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:06,661
What's this? - For madam.
-Take care of the house.

656
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:09,838
Be ready. lt's time for
the groom's party to arrive.

657
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:13,505
Why are you standing here?
-l'm not coming for wedding.

658
01:10:13,642 --> 01:10:17,339
Why? Angry? - You don't take
me and my daughter seriously.

659
01:10:17,479 --> 01:10:19,845
We have to receive
the groom's party.

660
01:10:19,982 --> 01:10:21,006
Why have l come
for the wedding?

661
01:10:21,150 --> 01:10:22,845
To clean the dinner plates?
-Who said so?

662
01:10:22,985 --> 01:10:25,852
No one. l feel so.
-Why are you so angry?

663
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:28,523
Everyone leaves
after the wedding.

664
01:10:28,657 --> 01:10:30,852
My daughter and me
will be left behind.

665
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:33,688
Look at me, daughter.
-l see.

666
01:10:34,396 --> 01:10:35,693
Sister, come here.

667
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:37,024
What's the matter, brother?

668
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:39,701
What did we discuss
yesterday? - What?

669
01:10:39,902 --> 01:10:41,369
About his daughter
and your son's marriage.

670
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:43,367
We confirmed it.

671
01:10:45,407 --> 01:10:48,035
Let's discuss in detail
after the wedding. Okay, dear?

672
01:10:49,578 --> 01:10:52,877
Bless me, aunty.
-Let's go.

673
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:54,549
What do you say now?

674
01:11:08,764 --> 01:11:09,560
Where did l keep it?

675
01:11:09,698 --> 01:11:10,722
Where did you get it?
-ln the backyard.

676
01:11:10,866 --> 01:11:15,064
Put it back there. - Fool.

677
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:03,110
Well come, brother-in-law.

678
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:07,449
Engagement is over. Forget the
case and talk of fees first.

679
01:12:07,589 --> 01:12:09,113
This way, please.

680
01:12:10,893 --> 01:12:12,690
Wait. There is time
for everything.

681
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:16,958
You may proceed. - Proceed!
Don't you have brains?

682
01:12:17,099 --> 01:12:18,828
Why did you stop again?
-He is scolding me.

683
01:12:18,934 --> 01:12:22,131
Scolding you!
l'll kill you.

684
01:12:23,272 --> 01:12:25,968
l'll handle you later.
Don't wait. Click the photos.

685
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:27,138
Wait

686
01:12:32,915 --> 01:12:34,212
Sit down.

687
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:45,991
This is a family photo.
-That's why l brought her.

688
01:12:51,033 --> 01:12:53,228
l got a joker.
-Come and join us.

689
01:12:54,703 --> 01:12:56,898
Get up you stupid.
-What's the time?

690
01:12:58,474 --> 01:12:59,839
l don't have a watch
Oh my dress!

691
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:08,175
Why do you trouble Dolly?
-Today is the last day for it.

692
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:13,353
Why? Tonight is the wedding.
Everyone go home tomorrow.

693
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:21,521
You feel sad for going away
from me, to London, right?

694
01:13:23,565 --> 01:13:24,361
Yes

695
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:31,036
Lock the door
after you finish. - Okay.

696
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:40,545
What brings you here?

697
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:47,222
Why are you sweating?
Wipe it.

698
01:13:47,489 --> 01:13:48,888
l'm leaving for
London tomorrow.

699
01:13:54,997 --> 01:13:55,895
Why not we talk?

700
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:02,900
People here think the
boys from abroad...

701
01:14:03,772 --> 01:14:09,301
... exploit girls here.

702
01:14:10,679 --> 01:14:15,582
That's wrong.
l'm not one of them.

703
01:14:17,186 --> 01:14:17,982
True.

704
01:14:30,432 --> 01:14:34,596
l'll go, speak to my dad and
then, talk to your brother.

705
01:14:36,405 --> 01:14:37,269
ls it okay?

706
01:14:51,987 --> 01:14:55,013
Leave me alone.
-Stop it.

707
01:14:58,494 --> 01:15:00,291
Stop being naughty and
do useful work.

708
01:15:00,395 --> 01:15:01,623
l want Santhosh

709
01:15:03,599 --> 01:15:07,126
Stop it. Listen to me. l'll
talk to him.- l'll kill myself.

710
01:15:07,769 --> 01:15:08,963
Listen to me.

711
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:14,639
Stop it and mind the work.

712
01:15:15,344 --> 01:15:16,311
What happened is..

713
01:15:18,247 --> 01:15:22,980
Brother, what do we do? Such
people shouldn't be spared.

714
01:15:23,252 --> 01:15:26,153
They have the knack of
trapping rich boys.

715
01:15:26,588 --> 01:15:30,490
We will lose Santosh if
we are not careful.

716
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:41,829
Let go off my hand.

717
01:15:43,705 --> 01:15:44,831
Mother is calling you.

718
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:54,008
You have to go to jewellery
shop immediately. - Now!

719
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:57,579
As the aunt, l've to present
bangles to the bride.

720
01:15:57,953 --> 01:16:00,183
l forgot about it.
Go get it.

721
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:01,856
l know nothing
about selection.

722
01:16:02,057 --> 01:16:04,685
Take him along if you don't
know. Here is the money.

723
01:16:04,826 --> 01:16:06,691
Let's go. We have to be
back in time for wedding.

724
01:16:07,462 --> 01:16:10,522
Take your time but buy
good and expensive ones.

725
01:16:10,732 --> 01:16:12,199
Let's go.

726
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:19,101
You! Will you have tea?

727
01:16:23,812 --> 01:16:26,042
How old are you?
-20 years.

728
01:16:26,548 --> 01:16:29,142
You are too smart
for your age.

729
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:35,955
Let's go
go

730
01:16:36,091 --> 01:16:38,389
Who else is
there in your family?

731
01:16:39,494 --> 01:16:40,483
Just my brother and me.

732
01:16:41,530 --> 01:16:43,725
What does your brother do?
-Farming.

733
01:16:44,032 --> 01:16:48,059
Farming! - We've poultry and
cattle. We sell milk too.

734
01:16:48,236 --> 01:16:50,295
Did you take your brother's
permission...

735
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:51,402
... to attend this wedding?

736
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:54,405
Yes. l won't do anything
without telling my brother.

737
01:16:54,576 --> 01:16:57,807
Did you trap my son
with brother's permission?

738
01:17:03,285 --> 01:17:04,149
Why are you quiet?

739
01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:08,245
What can she say?
Things have gone haywire.

740
01:17:10,559 --> 01:17:12,584
Aunty is scolding your
friend. Go, fast.

741
01:17:13,395 --> 01:17:16,193
l was impressed by your
participation in chores.

742
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:18,095
But didn't realise
your true character.

743
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:23,765
Look at her innocent act!
-What an act!

744
01:17:24,139 --> 01:17:25,766
Why are you shouting at her?

745
01:17:26,041 --> 01:17:28,601
We are busy with wedding and...

746
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:31,506
... she is busy with
attracting Santosh.

747
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:35,174
Don't say so.
Santosh liked her.

748
01:17:35,317 --> 01:17:37,444
Very intelligent of her!
-Uncle.

749
01:17:37,586 --> 01:17:39,884
Shut up. Let's elders
take charge.

750
01:17:39,988 --> 01:17:41,615
- Father,...
-l said shut up.

751
01:17:41,823 --> 01:17:45,953
Go away if you have any
shame left. Go.

752
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:50,294
Go and find someone else.

753
01:18:12,454 --> 01:18:15,981
See, l told you she
cannot stay away from me.

754
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:17,924
Look at the tears
on seeing me.

755
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:20,987
Don't worry.
Your brother has come.

756
01:18:21,263 --> 01:18:25,666
Crying like a baby.
Stop crying.

757
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:30,994
How are you, bride?
l've brought the saree.

758
01:18:31,206 --> 01:18:33,174
You will wear it
during the ceremony.

759
01:18:33,508 --> 01:18:36,671
Take it, dear.

760
01:18:42,117 --> 01:18:44,847
Greetings. You are
Lalita's father, l presume.

761
01:18:44,986 --> 01:18:46,214
l saw you when l was a kid.

762
01:18:46,388 --> 01:18:49,016
l've brought you a silk 'pancha'
lt's woven in our village.

763
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,891
What's this, brother?
-Wait.

764
01:19:03,205 --> 01:19:05,867
What happened, dear?

765
01:19:07,075 --> 01:19:10,533
Even the brother
is like his sister!

766
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:14,375
You are invited to
bless the married couple.

767
01:19:14,516 --> 01:19:17,542
Not try to trap rich boys.

768
01:19:17,686 --> 01:19:21,281
What are you saying!
-l don't know your name.

769
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:23,891
Don't act innocent.

770
01:19:24,226 --> 01:19:25,557
Would your sister trap a
millionaire...

771
01:19:25,660 --> 01:19:28,925
... without your knowledge?

772
01:19:30,198 --> 01:19:32,723
l'll kill you if you say
one more word about my sister.

773
01:19:32,901 --> 01:19:35,734
lf you know what
happened here...

774
01:19:35,904 --> 01:19:40,398
... you will beat up your
sister and take her away.

775
01:19:40,942 --> 01:19:41,806
Brother......

776
01:19:57,959 --> 01:20:00,689
Don't do it, brother.

777
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:06,768
lt's your mistake and
show temper on others!

778
01:20:06,968 --> 01:20:09,266
You are after all a farmer.

779
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:14,932
Not deserve even to be
our labour.

780
01:20:15,143 --> 01:20:17,771
You people aim for my son!

781
01:20:17,979 --> 01:20:20,777
Get out of here.
-She said get out.

782
01:20:20,982 --> 01:20:24,782
She has done enough dirty
work. Take her away.

783
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:29,450
Let's go away, sister.

784
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:38,966
Forgive me, brother.

785
01:20:39,835 --> 01:20:42,804
l consider it as my
sister's wedding.

786
01:20:44,172 --> 01:20:45,969
Don't want to disturb it.

787
01:20:47,342 --> 01:20:48,969
Here, l'm leaving
with humility.

788
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:56,974
Else l'd have taught a lesson
to all, one by one. Let's go.

789
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:38,689
Stop eating and keep the
bunch in the car.

790
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:41,522
What is taking them so long?
-Here they come. Come on.

791
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:43,357
Ladies doesn't have
sense of time.

792
01:21:48,904 --> 01:21:52,032
Take care. Phone us up
when you reach.

793
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:54,705
Let me say bye to Santosh.
-Do it fast.

794
01:22:01,082 --> 01:22:04,540
l've to tell you something
before l leave.

795
01:22:05,587 --> 01:22:10,047
You listen to your heart.
Nothing else.

796
01:22:10,926 --> 01:22:16,728
You think Sri left you. No.
She left behind her heart.

797
01:22:17,766 --> 01:22:20,735
Go, have a look in her room.
-lt's time to leave, daughter.

798
01:22:56,972 --> 01:22:59,600
This horse is with me
since my childhood.

799
01:22:59,808 --> 01:23:02,936
lt's precious to me.
lt has always been with me.

800
01:23:07,482 --> 01:23:13,944
What are you doing here?
Everyone is downstairs. Come.

801
01:23:14,489 --> 01:23:16,286
You proceed.
l'll join you.

802
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:22,960
We are leaving tomorrow.
Do you remember your promise?

803
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:26,960
l do.
l remember.

804
01:23:28,169 --> 01:23:30,967
Everything went off smoothly
excepting for that girl's...

805
01:23:31,106 --> 01:23:34,132
Forget it and watch there.

806
01:23:34,342 --> 01:23:37,800
What's wrong?
Why are you so dull?

807
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:40,977
Cannot you see us talk?

808
01:23:43,518 --> 01:23:50,321
Don't think of her.
She came, she left.

809
01:23:52,861 --> 01:23:55,489
l'll be with you, forever.

810
01:23:56,364 --> 01:24:02,667
Will you wait for me?
-Of course l do.- How long?

811
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:06,830
Forever.
-Can you wait for 2 years?

812
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:12,176
10 years?
100 years?

813
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:21,511
You cannot but Sri can.

814
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:28,529
Sri isn't a passing cloud.
lt's you.

815
01:24:32,567 --> 01:24:39,530
You can forget it since
the hopes have crashed.

816
01:24:42,577 --> 01:24:44,204
Don't take his
words seriously.

817
01:24:44,412 --> 01:24:47,381
Neither his father nor he
are decision makers.

818
01:24:47,582 --> 01:24:51,382
lt's his mother.
She gave us her word.

819
01:24:51,586 --> 01:24:54,214
Your marriage with
him is sure.

820
01:25:23,785 --> 01:25:28,245
Brother told me what happened
there. Rich talk anything.

821
01:25:28,456 --> 01:25:30,924
They always blame others.

822
01:25:31,126 --> 01:25:33,253
Brother was humiliated
because of me.

823
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:36,931
Yet, he never said
a word to me.

824
01:25:37,298 --> 01:25:41,257
You know him well. He will
feel bad if you are sad.

825
01:25:41,469 --> 01:25:43,767
Take my advice and
forget it all.

826
01:25:46,808 --> 01:25:51,609
That isn't easy for me.
l love Santosh deeply.

827
01:25:58,820 --> 01:26:00,947
What! Santosh didn't
catch the flight!

828
01:26:01,089 --> 01:26:02,954
He got on it and was
with me till Dubai.

829
01:26:03,091 --> 01:26:05,958
He didn't take connecting
flight to London from there.

830
01:26:06,828 --> 01:26:09,956
He cheated me.
-Cheat you! Nonsense.

831
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:14,798
lt's love.
-Love!!

832
01:26:40,295 --> 01:26:50,830
O bird don't fly away
but come back to nest

833
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:54,338
Why do you throw tantrums?

834
01:26:54,542 --> 01:26:58,069
Why take my joke seriously?

835
01:26:58,313 --> 01:27:03,842
Take me with you.
l'll come along

836
01:27:48,963 --> 01:27:52,296
l sent away all my hapiness
with my beloved

837
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:55,663
Hope it is safe
and nothing to worry

838
01:27:56,070 --> 01:27:59,369
Wonder if she is happy
with my little taunts

839
01:27:59,741 --> 01:28:02,801
Has the girls mind become smaller?

840
01:28:03,344 --> 01:28:09,305
Oh sparrow! Be a messenger of
love and reach the message to her..

841
01:28:10,451 --> 01:28:12,749
..in advance that her beloved is coming.

842
01:28:12,954 --> 01:28:17,550
Oh crow! Tell her, in detail,
all that have heard

843
01:29:08,009 --> 01:29:11,308
Yesterday l knew what is hunger!
And it has filled my stomach!

844
01:29:11,612 --> 01:29:14,740
Denied me food and asked me to go!

845
01:29:15,283 --> 01:29:18,343
Felt sleepy but
sleep didn't bless me

846
01:29:18,586 --> 01:29:21,987
But has driven me away from coming closer!

847
01:29:22,390 --> 01:29:24,756
Love is magic

848
01:29:24,926 --> 01:29:28,418
Who would not give
when you ask for it?

849
01:29:30,531 --> 01:29:36,697
O love! You know it very well
Tell me who could overcome it

850
01:30:08,302 --> 01:30:11,430
How does the boy
you love look like?

851
01:30:12,140 --> 01:30:14,267
Shut up.
-ls he fair complexioned?

852
01:30:16,477 --> 01:30:17,671
He has no mustache and
hair is messy.

853
01:30:20,081 --> 01:30:21,946
Will it be like a lorry carrying bush?

854
01:30:32,994 --> 01:30:37,897
Are you the station master?
Who is he?

855
01:30:39,167 --> 01:30:41,465
Who are you?
You sit like a ticket less traveler?

856
01:30:41,669 --> 01:30:42,465
l have got the ticket!

857
01:30:57,185 --> 01:30:59,312
Feed the offerings
to the cow.

858
01:31:02,190 --> 01:31:08,322
Don't trip on the plate.
Be careful. Go and complete the ritual.

859
01:31:17,705 --> 01:31:20,833
Your look makes me tense as it is!
Don't know,how will it be if you're angry?

860
01:31:21,709 --> 01:31:23,176
So you would say what l have to say!

861
01:31:24,712 --> 01:31:27,681
l only loved your sister!
l am Santhosh!

862
01:31:31,219 --> 01:31:37,021
What happened is. . .
Your sister is a nice girl.

863
01:31:37,391 --> 01:31:40,690
You raised her well.
She doesn't even look at boys.

864
01:31:42,230 --> 01:31:43,697
lt took great efforts for me to lure her!

865
01:31:46,067 --> 01:31:47,864
l would have conveyed
this better in English!

866
01:31:48,402 --> 01:31:50,529
But you don't know English

867
01:31:51,239 --> 01:31:53,537
My people shouldn't have
said those things to you.

868
01:31:53,908 --> 01:31:56,706
You are justified in getting
angry and taking away Sri.

869
01:31:57,745 --> 01:31:59,212
l'm sorry for what they did.

870
01:32:02,583 --> 01:32:03,550
Have you finished?

871
01:32:03,918 --> 01:32:05,818
l wonder if l explained well
but this is what the matter is.

872
01:32:07,088 --> 01:32:07,884
Okay. Let's go.

873
01:32:11,259 --> 01:32:13,056
Should you take him inside now?

874
01:32:13,427 --> 01:32:15,895
What is this sir?
We want to talk something in private

875
01:32:16,030 --> 01:32:16,894
You come

876
01:32:18,432 --> 01:32:20,559
He is inviting trouble.

877
01:32:20,935 --> 01:32:23,733
l had different opinion of you
But you are a gentleman!

878
01:32:31,612 --> 01:32:33,580
Why is it so calm?

879
01:32:33,948 --> 01:32:36,416
lt is always calm
before a storm.

880
01:32:37,451 --> 01:32:38,247
This is what l meant!

881
01:32:42,623 --> 01:32:44,591
Dump him outside the village.

882
01:32:51,132 --> 01:32:53,032
This isn't your problem
but your sister's.

883
01:32:53,467 --> 01:32:55,435
Throwing him out
isn't the solution.

884
01:32:55,970 --> 01:32:58,097
A girl cannot feel free with
brother about everything.

885
01:32:58,306 --> 01:32:59,102
She could have told her
mother if she had.

886
01:32:59,307 --> 01:33:00,103
Think about it!

887
01:33:01,309 --> 01:33:03,277
l did this because l was
reminded of mother!

888
01:33:03,978 --> 01:33:04,945
l cannot forget the day
my father threw bundles of...

889
01:33:05,813 --> 01:33:07,940
... money at my mother's face.

890
01:33:09,817 --> 01:33:11,444
lt broke my mother's
heart and she died.

891
01:33:11,652 --> 01:33:13,950
No, l don't want these rich people

892
01:33:14,155 --> 01:33:16,282
They change fast

893
01:33:17,825 --> 01:33:19,622
l don't mind my sister
suffer today but...

894
01:33:19,827 --> 01:33:21,294
... l don't want her face
my mother's fate tomorrow.

895
01:33:21,429 --> 01:33:22,953
-But..
-No, sir

896
01:33:32,173 --> 01:33:35,973
-He had come for his bag
-No, l came back for Sri

897
01:33:38,012 --> 01:33:38,979
No, don't

898
01:33:42,016 --> 01:33:43,483
Please, don't separate us

899
01:33:43,684 --> 01:33:46,653
l love her more than you do

900
01:33:46,854 --> 01:33:49,322
l've ignored my parents
and everything for her

901
01:33:49,690 --> 01:33:52,318
Tell me, what should l
do to prove my love

902
01:33:52,526 --> 01:33:55,324
Ask him to leave

903
01:33:55,529 --> 01:33:58,157
Even a person to be hanged
is granted a wish.

904
01:33:58,366 --> 01:34:01,995
-But you.. -Can't you understand
what is told?

905
01:34:02,870 --> 01:34:06,670
Why do you rage madly?
Your sister reminds you of your mother.

906
01:34:06,874 --> 01:34:09,172
This boy reminds me
of you, as an youngster.

907
01:34:09,543 --> 01:34:13,673
Just like this.. you had asked me
Don't you remember?

908
01:34:21,555 --> 01:34:24,183
Had l not given you a chance
you wouldn't be here

909
01:34:24,392 --> 01:34:25,859
ls it fair if you refuse to him?

910
01:34:35,736 --> 01:34:39,536
Dear, is it enough if you alone
choose your partner..

911
01:34:39,740 --> 01:34:44,040
-..or you need opinion?
-You should also approve

912
01:34:45,579 --> 01:34:47,206
Tell me what to do
to convince you?

913
01:34:50,084 --> 01:34:52,052
Will you do anything?
-l'll.

914
01:34:53,087 --> 01:34:54,384
You have to work in the fields.

915
01:34:55,589 --> 01:34:57,557
l'll give you an
acre of my land.

916
01:34:57,758 --> 01:35:00,727
You must produce as much as
l produce. Can you?

917
01:35:00,928 --> 01:35:05,058
You must milk the cows,
clean the sheds.

918
01:35:05,199 --> 01:35:07,724
Take care of cattle
and poultry.

919
01:35:07,935 --> 01:35:11,234
How can he do that?
-He has to do.

920
01:35:11,439 --> 01:35:15,739
Just leaving the
parents isn't enough.

921
01:35:15,943 --> 01:35:19,242
He has to lead a farmer's life
which his mother scorned at....

922
01:35:19,447 --> 01:35:24,077
... if he wants to marry
the girl of this household.

923
01:35:31,625 --> 01:35:32,751
l will prove myself

924
01:35:33,794 --> 01:35:35,091
l'll do whatever you said

925
01:35:35,963 --> 01:35:37,590
l'll produce more
than you do.

926
01:35:37,965 --> 01:35:40,934
..then only he'll know that
l love Sri more than him

927
01:35:41,135 --> 01:35:43,433
This is not like working in computers
This is hard work

928
01:35:43,637 --> 01:35:45,434
Falling in love was easy

929
01:35:45,973 --> 01:35:47,941
Let me work hard to prove it

930
01:35:50,144 --> 01:35:52,942
lf you fail you've to
forget my sister..

931
01:35:53,481 --> 01:35:55,108
..and leave the village

932
01:36:07,328 --> 01:36:08,955
You should sleep here

933
01:36:09,163 --> 01:36:10,960
l'll wake you up at dawn

934
01:36:20,841 --> 01:36:21,967
A grand welcome!

935
01:36:52,373 --> 01:36:53,340
Get up!

936
01:36:59,713 --> 01:37:01,510
You! l slept late
because of the stink.

937
01:37:02,049 --> 01:37:04,677
-Do you want coffee?
-Boost

938
01:37:05,886 --> 01:37:07,513
Go and have it

939
01:37:13,060 --> 01:37:15,187
What boy, was the boost good?

940
01:37:16,897 --> 01:37:18,865
Go and clean the cowshed

941
01:37:39,420 --> 01:37:42,218
He is trapped in net
for the sake of love

942
01:37:42,356 --> 01:37:47,726
Poor boy!
Oh poor boy!

943
01:37:53,100 --> 01:37:53,896
Oh God!

944
01:38:15,122 --> 01:38:21,425
lgnorant of the troubles that love has..

945
01:38:25,132 --> 01:38:26,599
l think l had pressed the wrong button

946
01:38:29,136 --> 01:38:35,268
..the rich boy is in agony

947
01:38:43,984 --> 01:38:45,781
This is the field you
have to tilt.

948
01:38:45,986 --> 01:38:47,283
-Plough it
-Where is the tractor?

949
01:38:47,488 --> 01:38:50,286
No tractors. You have to
tilt without that.

950
01:38:50,491 --> 01:38:52,618
But how? - Like this.

951
01:39:09,343 --> 01:39:10,640
Brother, look at him.

952
01:39:10,778 --> 01:39:14,305
l thought he will survive
a few days but no.

953
01:39:25,859 --> 01:39:29,488
-Eat it.
-lt's pungent.

954
01:40:24,752 --> 01:40:27,220
Go back by the 1st train
tomorrow. Why suffer like this?

955
01:40:27,421 --> 01:40:28,888
He looks like a mad guy

956
01:41:45,666 --> 01:41:46,963
Even tomorrow l'll eat the same

957
01:41:57,344 --> 01:42:01,144
-Are you leaving by the morning train?
-Not even by the evening train.

958
01:43:18,425 --> 01:43:21,883
Earlier for the proposal,
he said his sister is yet to come..

959
01:43:22,029 --> 01:43:24,896
-Now, he might ask us to wait till
this fellow leaves -You go and ask

960
01:43:25,098 --> 01:43:28,226
-What should he ask?
-Did you see that boy?

961
01:43:28,368 --> 01:43:32,737
He is strong like Ongole's bull
lf he wins, you're doomed

962
01:43:34,441 --> 01:43:38,741
You messed with her in the fair.
She is hitting you back. Come

963
01:44:14,314 --> 01:44:16,782
Where is Shivaramakrishnan's house here?

964
01:44:16,984 --> 01:44:21,114
-Where are you from?
-London -London?

965
01:44:22,656 --> 01:44:29,789
How are you related to that boy
who is doing odd jobs for him?

966
01:44:29,997 --> 01:44:32,465
-ls my son doing farm labour?
-ls he your son?

967
01:44:32,666 --> 01:44:35,464
Wait, l've to tell you a lot about him

968
01:44:37,004 --> 01:44:39,632
-ls anyone home?
-Who is it?

969
01:44:42,676 --> 01:44:43,472
This is the girl

970
01:44:48,682 --> 01:44:49,649
Why are you staring?

971
01:44:50,517 --> 01:44:52,314
Didn't you catch
a fish with a bait?

972
01:44:52,519 --> 01:44:54,817
l'm the father of
the fish you netted.

973
01:44:55,689 --> 01:44:57,156
Don't look at me like an owl.

974
01:44:59,693 --> 01:45:03,823
-Call your brother
-Who is it, dear?

975
01:45:09,870 --> 01:45:11,838
-Are you Shivaramakrishna?
-Yes

976
01:45:12,039 --> 01:45:14,007
Do you know who am l?
Santhosh's father

977
01:45:14,207 --> 01:45:15,674
Have you come for your son?

978
01:45:15,876 --> 01:45:19,175
No, l came to say hello to you
'and offer you sweets

979
01:45:19,313 --> 01:45:22,180
They don't even know
what is hospitality.

980
01:45:22,316 --> 01:45:26,685
Your company deprived him the
respect he deserves.

981
01:45:26,887 --> 01:45:30,516
l don't need your hospitality.
Anyway do you know the meaning of it?

982
01:45:31,058 --> 01:45:32,855
You make my son
work as a labour!

983
01:45:34,127 --> 01:45:36,561
He is the son of one of the
top 500 millionaires of London.

984
01:45:36,697 --> 01:45:41,259
So? - Nothing.
Watch me take back my son.

985
01:45:41,368 --> 01:45:42,357
Take him.

986
01:45:46,073 --> 01:45:50,373
Then, why did you keep him
this long?

987
01:45:51,912 --> 01:45:53,209
Control your tongue.

988
01:45:53,413 --> 01:45:56,439
l kept quiet that day
as it was your home ground.

989
01:45:56,750 --> 01:45:58,547
This is my home ground.

990
01:45:58,752 --> 01:46:01,778
You will die if you
don't behave yourself.

991
01:46:01,922 --> 01:46:05,380
Are you threatening! He can
throw money and bring police.

992
01:46:05,592 --> 01:46:07,059
You will be put behind bars.

993
01:46:07,160 --> 01:46:09,060
You have to call police but...

994
01:46:09,229 --> 01:46:13,393
...l can kill you right where
you are standing now.

995
01:46:14,434 --> 01:46:17,062
Want to kill?
Come on, kill me.

996
01:46:39,292 --> 01:46:40,088
What's all this?

997
01:46:40,260 --> 01:46:41,090
Why did you come here?

998
01:46:41,294 --> 01:46:44,457
He came all the way from London
for you and you ask him why!

999
01:46:44,631 --> 01:46:48,067
Your condition makes me cry.

1000
01:46:49,536 --> 01:46:53,939
l've to talk to my son.
You people may leave.

1001
01:46:58,612 --> 01:47:02,013
How can you spoil your
future for a girl?

1002
01:47:05,585 --> 01:47:06,381
Let's go back to London.

1003
01:47:11,925 --> 01:47:15,383
You used to consider
me your friend.

1004
01:47:17,664 --> 01:47:19,564
You should help me if
you are my close friend.

1005
01:47:20,934 --> 01:47:22,993
He is right, uncle.

1006
01:47:26,573 --> 01:47:27,562
Why didn't you
leave with them?

1007
01:47:28,408 --> 01:47:31,309
He is your only son but
my only friend too.

1008
01:47:42,022 --> 01:47:45,253
Let me ask you as a father.
What if you lose?

1009
01:47:46,693 --> 01:47:48,320
l never thought of it.
How could you?

1010
01:47:49,529 --> 01:47:51,724
What if you lose?

1011
01:47:54,034 --> 01:47:56,502
You are sitting on the well.
What if you fall in the well?

1012
01:47:58,705 --> 01:48:00,002
l've support to prevent it.

1013
01:48:00,207 --> 01:48:02,505
l won't lose because l've
my love for support.

1014
01:48:02,609 --> 01:48:05,169
Love drove you crazy.

1015
01:48:05,378 --> 01:48:07,846
Have l ever said you
are money crazy?

1016
01:48:08,048 --> 01:48:09,174
Well said.

1017
01:48:10,984 --> 01:48:12,008
What did you understand?

1018
01:48:12,118 --> 01:48:14,678
l just wanted to know.

1019
01:48:16,490 --> 01:48:20,620
Everyone here talks more
intelligently than me-Take it.

1020
01:48:32,572 --> 01:48:34,904
l don't understand
the way you live.

1021
01:48:35,575 --> 01:48:38,373
You leave luxuries and
live on this food?

1022
01:48:38,512 --> 01:48:42,471
One is born with his
fate already written.

1023
01:48:42,716 --> 01:48:45,708
One should enjoy it
while it lasted.

1024
01:48:46,953 --> 01:48:49,046
ls he listening?
-l think so.

1025
01:48:50,857 --> 01:48:52,722
Some people work all
the time like machines.

1026
01:48:53,260 --> 01:48:56,058
Earn millions and consider
themselves lucky.

1027
01:48:56,296 --> 01:48:59,629
They don't realise love is
the most worthy possession.

1028
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,833
Life is over by the
time they realise it.

1029
01:49:03,370 --> 01:49:05,565
Do you want him repeat it?

1030
01:49:05,939 --> 01:49:08,669
l hear big talk of love.

1031
01:49:08,875 --> 01:49:10,672
Does all this drudgery prove
the power of love?

1032
01:49:11,278 --> 01:49:13,075
Can we do it?
Eating it is no big deal.

1033
01:49:14,948 --> 01:49:18,406
Want me to eat it?
Why do you flaunt?

1034
01:49:55,889 --> 01:49:57,288
l think he is burning inside.

1035
01:49:59,025 --> 01:50:00,617
Should l bring water
to drink. - Get it!

1036
01:50:05,865 --> 01:50:10,359
Water... - There is
no water in the car.

1037
01:50:24,117 --> 01:50:27,553
How could you eat it!
lt will kill you.

1038
01:50:28,521 --> 01:50:30,216
You are not used to it.

1039
01:50:32,792 --> 01:50:34,157
How can you endure anything
for love sake?

1040
01:50:35,362 --> 01:50:36,659
Does love really have
so much power?

1041
01:50:36,863 --> 01:50:39,991
lf not, l wouldn't have
come here all the way.

1042
01:50:40,867 --> 01:50:43,165
Neither you would have
come for me.

1043
01:50:44,871 --> 01:50:46,771
They will accept his
love someday.

1044
01:50:51,044 --> 01:50:52,011
l won't accept.

1045
01:50:53,279 --> 01:50:55,839
l love my son for foregoing
everything for a girl.

1046
01:50:56,383 --> 01:51:01,013
But l don't like the girl who
lives in comfort like a queen.

1047
01:51:01,488 --> 01:51:03,513
l cannot accept it.
-You are wrong.

1048
01:51:04,891 --> 01:51:07,257
Who are you?
-Not a rich man like you.

1049
01:51:07,627 --> 01:51:11,859
l'm a station master
at a small railway station.

1050
01:51:12,999 --> 01:51:16,366
You are pained for your son
suffering in the name of love.

1051
01:51:16,569 --> 01:51:18,469
But that girl is
eating the same food.

1052
01:51:18,638 --> 01:51:22,768
Yes, sir. She even sleeps on
the floor as your son does so.

1053
01:51:23,076 --> 01:51:25,203
She is virtually living a
life that of a servant.

1054
01:51:25,912 --> 01:51:29,541
Do you think it is old
fashioned? lndeed it is.

1055
01:51:29,716 --> 01:51:35,211
She is old fashioned hence
prays to God for his success.

1056
01:51:43,263 --> 01:51:46,130
Keep it burning, dear.

1057
01:51:49,869 --> 01:51:55,830
My son Santosh, lived a
luxurious life.

1058
01:51:57,444 --> 01:52:00,242
He didn't know what
is hard work.

1059
01:52:01,781 --> 01:52:02,748
l raised him so.

1060
01:52:03,550 --> 01:52:08,249
Smell of mud on him
angered me.

1061
01:52:09,122 --> 01:52:12,148
Now l realized l'm standing
on the soil of my motherland,..

1062
01:52:12,258 --> 01:52:13,589
... which l have forgotten
long back.

1063
01:52:14,627 --> 01:52:19,758
Your love made my son and me
realise the value of it.

1064
01:52:32,979 --> 01:52:33,775
Bye.

1065
01:52:34,114 --> 01:52:36,605
Your decision isn't right.
My sister won't accept it.

1066
01:52:36,716 --> 01:52:39,014
lt will create problems
between you both. - Yes.

1067
01:52:39,219 --> 01:52:44,020
l don't want problems
because of me.

1068
01:52:45,191 --> 01:52:47,682
Don't worry.
l know her weakness.

1069
01:52:48,161 --> 01:52:49,788
She easily gets influenced
by worthless people.

1070
01:52:50,563 --> 01:52:53,464
l'm going back to London
l know how to convince her.

1071
01:52:54,300 --> 01:52:55,699
What's happening?
Come here.

1072
01:52:56,336 --> 01:52:57,462
What about her?

1073
01:52:57,670 --> 01:52:59,695
l announced her wedding because
of your sister's promise.

1074
01:52:59,839 --> 01:53:01,739
Now, people are eager to
know when is the wedding.

1075
01:53:01,875 --> 01:53:04,343
What will happen to her life
now? Look at her condition.

1076
01:53:04,444 --> 01:53:07,641
Stop it. My sister won't easily
believe her husband.

1077
01:53:07,847 --> 01:53:10,315
Your worry is Santosh
marrying that girl.

1078
01:53:10,483 --> 01:53:13,577
For that he has to
win the challenge.

1079
01:53:13,686 --> 01:53:16,484
Shivaram doesn't want
him to win.

1080
01:53:16,623 --> 01:53:19,990
He will surely lose it.
-Say it again!

1081
01:53:20,160 --> 01:53:22,993
He would definitely lose.

1082
01:53:38,812 --> 01:53:42,942
The blowing, high
and strong wind

1083
01:53:43,149 --> 01:53:46,778
...is showing what is love

1084
01:53:47,654 --> 01:53:55,618
The showers pouring
in response to it, is love

1085
01:53:56,329 --> 01:54:03,963
Love is what keeps us alive

1086
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:15,145
Love is in the drizzle
that makes seedlings grow

1087
01:54:15,849 --> 01:54:24,484
Love is what that fills
your life with colours.

1088
01:55:39,098 --> 01:55:40,565
l see seeds grow in others
fields but none in mine.

1089
01:56:08,127 --> 01:56:09,924
Even my field seeds have grown

1090
01:56:11,297 --> 01:56:19,932
No one can tell when the
life begins in us

1091
01:56:20,306 --> 01:56:28,941
No one knows when the love
is sparked in one's heart

1092
01:56:29,482 --> 01:56:37,446
Even if there is a word
to define love...

1093
01:56:38,157 --> 01:56:40,625
...that word itself doesn't
know it does so

1094
01:56:40,760 --> 01:56:45,788
Love is, pouring out poetry
without even knowing alphabets

1095
01:56:46,332 --> 01:56:54,797
A river doesn't know it's
own force while it flows

1096
01:56:55,341 --> 01:57:03,806
The sapling doesn't know its ability
of yielding a crop.

1097
01:57:49,729 --> 01:57:58,194
The soil doesn't know its ability
of giving life to plants

1098
01:57:58,738 --> 01:58:07,043
But the abundant crop is
evident to the toil that went into it.

1099
01:58:07,747 --> 01:58:15,711
lf the toil results in bringing
one's beloved close, it's victory

1100
01:58:16,589 --> 01:58:23,893
One gets blessed with love
when he deserves

1101
01:58:24,597 --> 01:58:33,232
Journey of life would be easy
if one has a companion

1102
01:58:33,773 --> 01:58:42,238
Life would be fulfilling when
one has someone to cry for him

1103
01:59:20,586 --> 01:59:22,281
Driver, let's move.

1104
01:59:27,894 --> 01:59:32,058
Sister, we have trouble.
You are going to lose your son.

1105
01:59:32,231 --> 01:59:34,631
That girl is sure to become
your daughter-in-law.

1106
01:59:35,001 --> 01:59:38,960
l trust that you will
stand by your promise.

1107
01:59:39,172 --> 01:59:44,405
What do l do now?
Why don't you talk?

1108
01:59:44,844 --> 01:59:46,709
Tell me what do l do?

1109
01:59:47,180 --> 01:59:53,312
but l always fulfilled
my promise.

1110
01:59:53,519 --> 01:59:55,544
lt will be the same this
time too. - l know.

1111
01:59:56,122 --> 01:59:57,646
l don't know what you do but...

1112
01:59:58,357 --> 02:00:00,655
... she shouldn't become
my daughter-in-law.

1113
02:00:01,527 --> 02:00:02,858
l want my Santosh back.

1114
02:00:05,698 --> 02:00:09,998
l wanted to hear it from you.
l'll act now.

1115
02:00:42,368 --> 02:00:45,860
Who is it? - lt's me.
What are you doing?

1116
02:00:46,072 --> 02:00:47,437
l'm making way for
water to drain out.

1117
02:00:47,840 --> 02:00:53,142
Why? - To prevent damage to
crop by flooding due to rain.

1118
02:00:53,312 --> 02:00:55,712
There won't be any rain
because of this winds. Go.

1119
02:00:58,317 --> 02:00:59,375
lt appears like it's
going to rain.

1120
02:01:00,586 --> 02:01:05,717
l'm a farmer for years.
Don't l know when it rains?

1121
02:01:18,704 --> 02:01:21,400
Narsima, do it in
our field too.

1122
02:01:21,607 --> 02:01:24,303
No need. l did it already.

1123
02:01:27,880 --> 02:01:30,474
You are getting wet.
l'll handle it.

1124
02:01:51,570 --> 02:01:54,095
Why did you sleep here?
-Why did l sleep here?

1125
02:01:54,774 --> 02:01:57,766
l feel depressed. - let me
lift your moods.

1126
02:01:57,977 --> 02:02:01,640
Your sister has passed in
1st class. - Really!

1127
02:02:01,781 --> 02:02:03,442
Really.
-Sri......

1128
02:02:06,085 --> 02:02:07,677
Bless you.
Seek his blessings too.

1129
02:02:09,889 --> 02:02:12,687
Like your brother blessed,
marry the boy you love...

1130
02:02:12,925 --> 02:02:14,290
... and have a happy
married life.

1131
02:02:15,561 --> 02:02:17,859
lt isn't deliberate.
lt just came out of my mouth.

1132
02:02:18,331 --> 02:02:19,298
Don't get angry.

1133
02:02:19,498 --> 02:02:21,966
l'd have gifted the railway
station had it been my daughter.

1134
02:02:22,101 --> 02:02:22,897
What will you gift her?

1135
02:02:23,069 --> 02:02:25,867
Ask what you want,
bangles or earrings?

1136
02:02:26,005 --> 02:02:28,803
Go and ask
ask him

1137
02:02:30,409 --> 02:02:31,376
What do you want?

1138
02:02:32,044 --> 02:02:35,138
Shall we throw a
feast to all?

1139
02:02:35,281 --> 02:02:37,806
Sure. Let's invite
the entire village.

1140
02:02:38,050 --> 02:02:43,647
Brother, can we invite
Santosh too?

1141
02:02:47,493 --> 02:02:49,654
He is one of them.
lnvite him too.

1142
02:02:51,297 --> 02:02:53,663
He agreed but hesitatingly.
Better be careful.

1143
02:03:15,454 --> 02:03:16,512
Your brother is coming.

1144
02:03:18,124 --> 02:03:20,183
Don't feel shy.

1145
02:03:24,063 --> 02:03:28,193
Serve me 2 more.... Do you
have to serve only 2?

1146
02:03:31,871 --> 02:03:33,964
Let the buffalo go away to feed.

1147
02:03:35,074 --> 02:03:36,939
l'm making the noise
not the buffalo

1148
02:03:37,143 --> 02:03:39,270
He meant buffalo, not you.

1149
02:03:39,912 --> 02:03:41,880
Mind the plate while serving.

1150
02:03:59,165 --> 02:04:01,224
l must thank you.
-For what?

1151
02:04:01,367 --> 02:04:02,891
l ate till l choked.

1152
02:04:03,769 --> 02:04:07,500
You invited all so that
l can eat good food, right?

1153
02:04:09,108 --> 02:04:10,405
Won't you wish me
best of luck?

1154
02:04:11,343 --> 02:04:14,471
You have passed in your exams.
l've to pass in mine.

1155
02:04:56,489 --> 02:04:58,616
Greetings. My name is Rao.

1156
02:04:58,824 --> 02:05:02,624
Villages all around are dead
scared of me. - l know.

1157
02:05:02,828 --> 02:05:04,625
l checked the voters list...
and found that...

1158
02:05:04,830 --> 02:05:08,789
... you are the worst kind
of rogue in the village.

1159
02:05:09,001 --> 02:05:13,131
Do l have to kill someone?
-My daughter....Do l kill her?

1160
02:05:13,839 --> 02:05:17,297
Listen. My daughter loves
someone. - Do l kill him?

1161
02:05:18,010 --> 02:05:19,807
Cannot you keep
away from killing?

1162
02:05:20,012 --> 02:05:21,309
l'll kill you too
if you pay me.

1163
02:05:24,016 --> 02:05:25,643
l found the right man.
Come with me.

1164
02:05:27,353 --> 02:05:29,981
So, l've to ruin the crops.

1165
02:05:30,189 --> 02:05:34,319
Tell me what to do.
-There is a new product.

1166
02:05:34,527 --> 02:05:37,325
Use one liter, you get
good crop.

1167
02:05:37,863 --> 02:05:41,321
Use 2 liters,
you get dead crop.

1168
02:05:44,036 --> 02:05:49,668
Do it, do it. But no one
should find it out.

1169
02:06:04,557 --> 02:06:08,857
l'll ruin it.
Mix it fast. - Okay.

1170
02:06:09,728 --> 02:06:12,026
You mix it you and
you pour it.

1171
02:06:13,232 --> 02:06:19,193
My stomach is upset.
-Noise is coming from there.

1172
02:06:22,575 --> 02:06:23,872
Let's hide.

1173
02:06:26,412 --> 02:06:30,041
Who is he?
-l don't know too.

1174
02:06:40,259 --> 02:06:41,886
He is here for the same
purpose like ours.

1175
02:07:14,793 --> 02:07:17,421
Why do you make so much noise?

1176
02:07:18,297 --> 02:07:19,093
What's wrong with you all?

1177
02:08:45,884 --> 02:08:50,184
Help... help.

1178
02:08:50,389 --> 02:08:51,515
Don't worry.

1179
02:08:54,727 --> 02:08:56,354
Pour water from the tub.

1180
02:09:00,733 --> 02:09:02,701
lt's burning down.

1181
02:09:03,402 --> 02:09:04,369
Go get more water.

1182
02:09:09,742 --> 02:09:12,040
Get out, fast.

1183
02:09:23,756 --> 02:09:24,723
Get out.

1184
02:10:34,159 --> 02:10:36,957
Have you gone mad? What
if something went wrong?

1185
02:10:37,496 --> 02:10:38,463
What is in that box?

1186
02:10:39,498 --> 02:10:40,624
What is in that box?

1187
02:11:59,912 --> 02:12:02,540
He has done a good job.

1188
02:12:02,748 --> 02:12:05,717
He said he will finish me.
He did it.

1189
02:12:06,919 --> 02:12:08,546
What are you thinking?

1190
02:12:08,921 --> 02:12:11,719
You said l'm the
biggest crook.

1191
02:12:11,924 --> 02:12:14,552
But l'm wondering who was
that bespectacled crook...

1192
02:12:14,760 --> 02:12:16,557
... l saw in the fields.

1193
02:12:16,929 --> 02:12:21,229
You do the thinking. l'll get
my work done from Peddarao.

1194
02:12:21,400 --> 02:12:24,062
lt was your stupid idea
to ruin the crop,.

1195
02:12:24,269 --> 02:12:27,898
lt backfired. This time
l'll suggest an idea.

1196
02:12:28,106 --> 02:12:31,735
You hit me if it
didn't work. Trust me.

1197
02:12:35,280 --> 02:12:38,078
lt must be a good plan.
Do it.

1198
02:12:42,120 --> 02:12:43,747
l'll pay when the job is done.

1199
02:12:50,629 --> 02:13:00,265
Sister...
Where have they gone?

1200
02:13:02,975 --> 02:13:05,443
We cut the crop
and piled it up.

1201
02:13:05,644 --> 02:13:06,941
We will separate
grains tomorrow.

1202
02:13:07,646 --> 02:13:09,113
That will decide our fate.

1203
02:13:10,983 --> 02:13:15,977
Are you tense?
l feel 'something'.

1204
02:13:16,989 --> 02:13:18,616
l bragged that l'll produce...

1205
02:13:18,824 --> 02:13:21,122
... one bag full more
than he does.

1206
02:13:22,160 --> 02:13:24,788
l've been overconfident.
-A bit.

1207
02:13:26,164 --> 02:13:28,132
Your brother is a nice guy.

1208
02:13:28,333 --> 02:13:31,962
Tell him not to throw me
out from here if l fail.

1209
02:13:33,171 --> 02:13:36,140
l'll continue to be
a labour for him.

1210
02:13:37,175 --> 02:13:40,975
l cannot leave this village,
the cattle, goats, etc.

1211
02:13:41,179 --> 02:13:46,310
... and the angry looks
of your brother.

1212
02:13:55,360 --> 02:13:57,487
This yield belongs
to this guy.

1213
02:13:57,696 --> 02:14:01,325
Shift some of it
to Shivaram's.

1214
02:14:01,533 --> 02:14:03,160
That will defeat the guy.

1215
02:14:03,368 --> 02:14:06,667
You have improved.
-l don't need your praise.

1216
02:14:06,872 --> 02:14:07,668
Get on the job.

1217
02:14:48,747 --> 02:14:51,545
l forgot to feed the cows.

1218
02:15:08,767 --> 02:15:10,894
That day you got
burns on your back.

1219
02:15:11,036 --> 02:15:13,561
Today you got drenched.
What's all is happening to you!

1220
02:15:14,106 --> 02:15:15,403
Have you shifted the crop?
-l did.

1221
02:15:15,540 --> 02:15:20,068
Shift more to be
on safer side.

1222
02:15:25,617 --> 02:15:27,744
This should keep Santhosh
out of the picture.

1223
02:15:39,464 --> 02:15:41,261
Why are so many
people going there?

1224
02:15:41,466 --> 02:15:44,094
We should be eager,
about his work, not them.

1225
02:15:44,302 --> 02:15:46,270
Entire village wants
that boy win.

1226
02:15:46,471 --> 02:15:50,601
Let's go and watch, father.

1227
02:16:28,013 --> 02:16:30,140
One...

1228
02:16:40,025 --> 02:16:40,992
Three

1229
02:16:47,199 --> 02:16:47,995
Five.

1230
02:16:55,207 --> 02:16:58,335
Why are you here instead
of weighing the grains?

1231
02:16:59,544 --> 02:17:01,842
To wish for your victory
or the boy?

1232
02:17:01,980 --> 02:17:03,675
'Archana' is complete.
-l'm happy.

1233
02:17:09,888 --> 02:17:14,018
l don't know if he wins,
but he won your heart.

1234
02:17:14,159 --> 02:17:16,684
He has to win the
challenge too.

1235
02:17:16,895 --> 02:17:19,864
What? Won't you get them
married if he loses?

1236
02:17:21,066 --> 02:17:22,363
He won't lose.

1237
02:17:23,735 --> 02:17:27,193
He risked his life for the
toy my sister loves.

1238
02:17:27,405 --> 02:17:31,364
My mother won't forgive me
if he loses.

1239
02:17:32,911 --> 02:17:36,039
So, l checked the quantity
of crop at dawn.

1240
02:17:36,581 --> 02:17:37,707
l was doubtful of
the quantity.

1241
02:17:38,250 --> 02:17:41,219
To make him win, l
transferred...

1242
02:17:42,754 --> 02:17:44,381
... some of mine to his crop.

1243
02:17:45,257 --> 02:17:48,385
You are not educated
but you are wise.

1244
02:17:48,760 --> 02:17:50,728
Go and offer a coconut
for his victory.

1245
02:17:53,265 --> 02:17:54,562
42

1246
02:18:02,274 --> 02:18:04,071
Sri,... l've won.

1247
02:18:08,280 --> 02:18:09,747
How can l show my
face to my daughter?

1248
02:18:09,881 --> 02:18:11,906
What do l answer to
my sister, in London?

1249
02:18:12,117 --> 02:18:14,244
You ruined everything
with your dumb advice.

1250
02:18:19,624 --> 02:18:21,922
My advice will be
followed this time.

1251
02:18:22,127 --> 02:18:24,425
You see that it doesn't
become a police case.

1252
02:18:29,968 --> 02:18:32,266
Rotten coconut!

1253
02:18:37,509 --> 02:18:41,104
l've won.

1254
02:18:43,982 --> 02:18:46,951
My yield is more
by 2 bags.

1255
02:18:48,486 --> 02:18:56,951
O Lord Ganesha, you are
the son of Lord Shiva

1256
02:18:57,329 --> 02:19:02,130
Sri and Hari are
getting married

1257
02:19:02,334 --> 02:19:06,293
Everyone hailed it

1258
02:19:06,504 --> 02:19:09,132
Entire world is
dancing with joy

1259
02:19:24,522 --> 02:19:27,150
The eye is fluttering

1260
02:19:33,531 --> 02:19:36,989
Everything went well

1261
02:19:38,036 --> 02:19:40,163
Joy is all around

1262
02:19:42,540 --> 02:19:45,008
Happiness is mind blowing

1263
02:19:51,716 --> 02:19:56,176
First time to get
real excitement

1264
02:20:43,601 --> 02:20:48,061
Magic of love is
making the...

1265
02:20:48,339 --> 02:20:52,639
Heart thump like
the dance of a peacock

1266
02:20:53,178 --> 02:21:01,483
The youth is adding heat to it

1267
02:21:02,187 --> 02:21:04,314
Beauty is inviting

1268
02:21:06,524 --> 02:21:08,924
lt spreads fragrance

1269
02:21:15,533 --> 02:21:19,435
Love brought the victory
and united the love birds

1270
02:21:57,175 --> 02:22:05,810
Wishes are fulfilled and
the love resulted in marriage

1271
02:22:06,017 --> 02:22:14,891
They reached the pandal.
The joy is overwhelming

1272
02:22:15,093 --> 02:22:17,152
Let us enter into
the holy matrimony

1273
02:22:19,364 --> 02:22:21,832
Let the holy hymns
be uttered

1274
02:22:23,868 --> 02:22:28,567
What happens later is personal
People shouldn't hear it

1275
02:22:28,773 --> 02:22:33,506
Then there are now
obstacles between us.

1276
02:22:56,401 --> 02:23:00,030
You come with me.
Get in.

1277
02:23:01,573 --> 02:23:02,369
Let's go.

1278
02:23:06,744 --> 02:23:07,870
Who is that...

1279
02:23:18,923 --> 02:23:20,390
Where are you going? Stop.

1280
02:24:21,319 --> 02:24:22,115
Brother...

1281
02:24:56,688 --> 02:24:57,655
Get down.

1282
02:25:01,359 --> 02:25:03,657
l helped your brother a lot
since his childhood.

1283
02:25:03,828 --> 02:25:06,820
He didn't answer when l
asked for your hand for my son.

1284
02:25:07,031 --> 02:25:09,158
So, l arranged for it
in my way.

1285
02:25:09,300 --> 02:25:10,665
Son, tie the knot.

1286
02:25:25,717 --> 02:25:28,015
Who are you?
-Get lost.

1287
02:25:28,553 --> 02:25:31,522
You want to tie the knot?

1288
02:25:31,723 --> 02:25:33,190
Do you think you can
live after that?

1289
02:25:33,391 --> 02:25:35,689
Her brother will kill you
when he comes to know of it.

1290
02:25:35,893 --> 02:25:39,351
Coming here and killing
isn't that easy.

1291
02:25:39,497 --> 02:25:41,863
Why not? Haven't l come?
He will come too.

1292
02:25:42,066 --> 02:25:45,194
Here he comes.
Madam, let's run.

1293
02:25:47,071 --> 02:25:48,698
They are running away.
Catch them.

1294
02:25:52,910 --> 02:25:54,207
Come this way.

1295
02:25:54,912 --> 02:25:57,540
Which way have they gone?
l hear some noise.

1296
02:26:11,763 --> 02:26:12,889
Climb up.

1297
02:26:37,789 --> 02:26:41,088
Where is she?
Where is she hiding?

1298
02:26:41,292 --> 02:26:43,590
Master...

1299
02:26:45,463 --> 02:26:46,259
Tell us.

1300
02:26:49,133 --> 02:26:51,101
How dare you spit on me!

1301
02:26:53,304 --> 02:26:54,100
No...

1302
02:27:44,021 --> 02:27:46,319
Brother...
Let go off me.

1303
02:27:55,533 --> 02:27:56,500
Give me the 'Tali'.

1304
02:28:13,050 --> 02:28:15,678
Go.
Spare me.

1305
02:29:01,098 --> 02:29:02,065
Brother...

1306
02:29:08,105 --> 02:29:09,072
Where are you going?

1307
02:29:10,107 --> 02:29:14,737
-Brother.
-Tie the knot. - Brother...

1308
02:30:35,026 --> 02:30:37,824
You are telling the truth a
day before your release?

1309
02:30:38,195 --> 02:30:41,494
You always refused to meet
your people when they visited.

1310
02:30:42,033 --> 02:30:43,830
l thought you are
a hardcore criminal.

1311
02:30:44,368 --> 02:30:45,835
l never thought you
took punishment for...

1312
02:30:46,203 --> 02:30:47,500
... the crime you
never committed.

1313
02:30:49,040 --> 02:30:52,168
Your sacrifice won't go waste.
Your dream will come true.

1314
02:30:53,044 --> 02:30:54,739
As you wished, your sister
will be at the gate tomorrow...

1315
02:30:55,046 --> 02:30:56,513
. . .with her 2 kids.

1316
02:31:31,816 --> 02:31:35,217
They didn't find an auspicious
time to get married till today.

1317
02:31:35,586 --> 02:31:39,044
Your release is auspicious
time for them.

1318
02:31:39,256 --> 02:31:40,723
They came to seek
your blessings.

1319
02:31:56,440 --> 02:31:58,567
When l heard your story
l thought she is lucky...

1320
02:31:59,610 --> 02:32:01,578
... to have a brother like you.

1321
02:32:02,279 --> 02:32:05,407
But you are lucky to have
a sister like her. -Why l am not?

1322
02:32:24,969 --> 02:32:27,437
l didn't ask her to come.
She came on her own
