00:07:14,314 --> 00:07:18,114
Mr. White.. Mr. Black.

3
00:07:39,606 --> 00:07:47,809
Take it, sir. There
is no deal in love.

4
00:07:47,881 --> 00:07:50,145
Brother..

5
00:07:50,216 --> 00:07:51,274
What is it?

6
00:07:52,685 --> 00:07:55,153
Brother, have you seen him anywhere?

7
00:07:56,156 --> 00:07:57,214
Who is he?

8
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,484
He is Kishan, my brother.

9
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:00,217
Where does he live?

10
00:08:00,293 --> 00:08:01,351
Here in Goa.

11
00:08:01,427 --> 00:08:03,292
Even l will in Goa?
- ls it?

12
00:08:03,363 --> 00:08:05,160

13
00:08:05,832 --> 00:08:07,163
Goa village.

14
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:12,294
ls that so? Can you see the
street from here? - Yes.

15
00:08:12,372 --> 00:08:15,500
Take a right from there.
Take a left from there.

16
00:08:15,842 --> 00:08:19,175
You'll get a circle there.
Take two to four rounds of that..

17
00:08:19,245 --> 00:08:22,510
..circle, then ask anybody,
they'll tell you about him.

18
00:08:22,715 --> 00:08:24,182
They'll tell you about
him. ls that clear?

19
00:08:24,717 --> 00:08:31,316
Take it, sir. There
is no deal in love.

20
00:08:31,391 --> 00:08:33,791
Where will l search
for my Kishan now?

21
00:08:45,605 --> 00:08:47,800
Hey run! Hey brother!

22
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:49,869
Whose dog is this, brother?

23
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,278
Hey brother! Somebody help me!

24
00:08:53,813 --> 00:08:55,940
l am very scared of dogs!

25
00:08:59,485 --> 00:09:02,215
Open! Open.

26
00:09:02,555 --> 00:09:07,424
Kohl eyed. Kohl eyed..

27
00:09:08,228 --> 00:09:10,628
Hey you! How can you directly
come in like that?

28
00:09:11,297 --> 00:09:12,423
Shall l get down?

29
00:09:12,498 --> 00:09:17,492
Hey! Wait there! The meter
is running. Don't leave.

30
00:09:18,371 --> 00:09:19,429
We got down..

31
00:09:19,505 --> 00:09:20,563
Brother, there is a dog.

32
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,241
lf that dog had pulled my
wraparound, l would've..

33
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:27,973
..got embarrassed in public.
l found you, felt like l found God.

34
00:09:28,248 --> 00:09:31,240
Don't address me as God,
l am Tulsi. Who are you?

35
00:09:31,317 --> 00:09:36,254
l am Gopi. l am looking
for him. Do you know him?

36
00:09:36,322 --> 00:09:37,380
You are looking for him?

37
00:09:37,457 --> 00:09:41,257
Who doesn't know him? He
is famous all over lndia.

38
00:09:41,327 --> 00:09:42,385
By the way, who is he?

39
00:09:42,462 --> 00:09:43,520
What?

40
00:09:43,596 --> 00:09:48,590
l meant.. nobody has the
guts to say who he is.

41
00:09:48,668 --> 00:09:50,260
Yes.
- He is our..

42
00:09:50,536 --> 00:09:52,663
Kishan..
- Yes, Kiran. - Kishan.

43
00:09:52,739 --> 00:09:57,005
Are you deaf? l told the same
thing, Kishan. Kishan.

44
00:09:57,277 --> 00:10:01,805
l'll call him right away. 922..

45
00:10:07,287 --> 00:10:10,279
Hey Kishan.. where are
you? Where are you?

46
00:10:10,356 --> 00:10:11,414
Brother, let me talk to him.

47
00:10:11,491 --> 00:10:16,758
Where? Where? There! Okay,
one minute.. one minute..

48
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:18,023
Your brother is here.

49
00:10:18,298 --> 00:10:19,356
Give it to me.

50
00:10:19,432 --> 00:10:21,297
Here, talk to him.

51
00:10:21,367 --> 00:10:22,425
Hello!

52
00:10:22,502 --> 00:10:26,302
Where did you say you are?
l'll get him there right away.

53
00:10:46,526 --> 00:10:47,857
We've reached. We've reached.

54
00:10:47,927 --> 00:10:52,660
Come, come. Meet your brother.
Radhe, come.

55
00:10:52,732 --> 00:10:55,326
l am Gopi, Tulsi.
- The same.. understand my feelings.

56
00:10:55,535 --> 00:10:56,593
Do you see this building?

57
00:10:57,337 --> 00:10:58,395
But, that's a hut.

58
00:10:58,471 --> 00:11:00,803
You call that a building in English.

59
00:11:00,873 --> 00:11:03,000
There is a ground floor
on the first floor.

60
00:11:03,076 --> 00:11:04,407
There is a terrace on top of that.

61
00:11:04,477 --> 00:11:06,604
Your brother Akash must be there.

62
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:09,079
Kishan.
- The same.. are you nuts?

63
00:11:09,349 --> 00:11:12,614
Hey, why are you taking
this bag along with you?

64
00:11:12,685 --> 00:11:14,084
First, go and meet your brother.

65
00:11:14,354 --> 00:11:16,618
You first go and meet your brother.

66
00:11:16,689 --> 00:11:19,351
Give this bag to this brother.
Come on, go and meet your brother.

67
00:11:19,425 --> 00:11:20,949
Go. Go. Hurry up.

68
00:11:21,627 --> 00:11:24,619
Kishan!
There is water.. be careful.

69
00:11:24,697 --> 00:11:25,755
You'll get wet.

70
00:11:27,767 --> 00:11:28,825
Hey Kishan!

71
00:11:30,103 --> 00:11:31,434
Tulsi, here..

72
00:11:32,505 --> 00:11:38,375
Hey thief! Thief! Police!

73
00:11:41,647 --> 00:11:44,377
Brother, l've come all the
way from Hoshiarpur..

74
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:47,385
..searching for my brother.
Somebody stole my bag.

75
00:11:47,453 --> 00:11:48,511
Who was he?

76
00:11:48,588 --> 00:11:51,113
Tulsi. That thief stole my bag.

77
00:11:52,392 --> 00:11:53,450
Whose photograph is this?

78
00:11:53,526 --> 00:11:54,857
l've come in search of him.

79
00:11:54,927 --> 00:11:56,121
So, is he Tulsi?

80
00:11:56,529 --> 00:11:57,860
He is Kishan.

81
00:11:58,398 --> 00:11:59,456
Then who is Tulsi.

82
00:11:59,532 --> 00:12:00,590
Tulsi is the thief.

83
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:01,724
Then who is he?

84
00:12:02,135 --> 00:12:04,603
Sir, l've come all the way from
Hoshiarpur to take him.

85
00:12:06,072 --> 00:12:08,063
Are you searching for
him or the thief?

86
00:12:09,008 --> 00:12:11,670
l'll search for him and you should
search for the thief, right?

87
00:12:13,012 --> 00:12:14,070
Why are you looking for him?

88
00:12:14,547 --> 00:12:16,412
To take him back to Hoshiarpur.

89
00:12:16,482 --> 00:12:19,007
So, he is a run-away
from Hoshiarpur.

90
00:12:19,085 --> 00:12:21,417
He didn't run away from Hoshiarpur,
but walked..

91
00:12:21,487 --> 00:12:23,682
..l came running behind him.

92
00:12:23,756 --> 00:12:27,021
Tell me one thing, all together
how many men ran away?

93
00:12:27,093 --> 00:12:30,153
Total? There was only
one.. that Tulsi.

94
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,488
And you are looking for him?

95
00:12:31,564 --> 00:12:33,691
l am searching this guy, Kishan.

96
00:12:33,766 --> 00:12:34,824
And Tulsi?

97
00:12:34,901 --> 00:12:37,096
He ran away with my luggage,
right? That thief!

98
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:40,435
This is a police station and not
the alleys of the village to..

99
00:12:40,506 --> 00:12:43,839
..play hide and seek. You first
decide whom are you looking for.

100
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:46,640
You are very confused
and confusing me too.

101
00:12:46,712 --> 00:12:51,172
Decide whether you have to look
for Tulsi or this Kishan!

102
00:13:39,632 --> 00:13:40,690
Babu..

103
00:13:45,104 --> 00:13:46,162
Police!

104
00:13:46,239 --> 00:13:47,638
Hey!

105
00:13:47,707 --> 00:13:48,765
Open the coat! Oh no!

106
00:13:50,109 --> 00:13:51,167
Shit!

107
00:13:58,518 --> 00:14:03,512
lf l press a button, you all will
shatter to pieces with me.

108
00:14:03,589 --> 00:14:06,524
Why do you want to die?
Surrender yourself..

109
00:14:06,592 --> 00:14:09,720
..l will appeal to the court
to reduce your punishment.

110
00:14:09,795 --> 00:14:11,592
l don't want forgiveness. Leave.

111
00:14:11,664 --> 00:14:14,258
Look Babu, don't take a wrong step.

112
00:14:14,534 --> 00:14:17,935
lnspector, you can't convince me.

113
00:14:18,004 --> 00:14:20,598
Please, don't press the button.
We will do as per your wishes.

114
00:14:20,673 --> 00:14:25,940
Look, l'll keep this gun down.
Let them all leave from here.

115
00:14:26,546 --> 00:14:32,678
Okay? Okay, l am keeping
it. Relax. Relax.

116
00:14:33,286 --> 00:14:34,548
Move out from here! Out!

117
00:14:34,687 --> 00:14:35,745
Come on! Get out!

118
00:15:11,257 --> 00:15:12,781
This is mine, this
is Chhoti's, and..

119
00:15:12,858 --> 00:15:13,916
This..

120
00:15:13,993 --> 00:15:16,928
This is yours, this is mine,
and this.. Chhoti's.

121
00:15:16,996 --> 00:15:18,122
Okay.

122
00:15:18,197 --> 00:15:20,791
lt means, Chhoti's
share equals ours.

123
00:15:21,133 --> 00:15:22,998
Your sister, Divya is very lucky.

124
00:15:23,069 --> 00:15:24,593
You fool, idiot, isn't
she your sister too?

125
00:15:26,072 --> 00:15:29,007
Look dude, l was not destined
to go to school.

126
00:15:29,942 --> 00:15:32,342
l had a dream that l
would educate Divya.

127
00:15:32,812 --> 00:15:34,609
l am trying to fulfill that. What
difference does it make if..

128
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,807
..l am doing some swindling for her?

129
00:15:37,617 --> 00:15:41,144
l am not doing any robbery, murder
or fighting with anyone.

130
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,812
Just a bit of swindling.
That is acceptable.

131
00:15:43,623 --> 00:15:47,616
Look, l was telling the truth.
The bell rang. Hey Divya!

132
00:15:48,361 --> 00:15:49,623
You will live a very long life.

133
00:15:49,895 --> 00:15:53,626
l was just talking about you.
Do you have any problem?

134
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:56,361
Brother, this is London.
Everything is fine.

135
00:15:56,636 --> 00:15:57,830
l know. l know.

136
00:15:57,903 --> 00:16:00,633
Listen, l've deposited your
fees money in the bank.

137
00:16:00,973 --> 00:16:02,634
Manager said he would transfer it.

138
00:16:02,975 --> 00:16:05,637
Strange, isn't it? Earlier men
used to get transferred and..

139
00:16:05,711 --> 00:16:08,373
..nowadays it is money. Our
country has progressed.

140
00:16:08,648 --> 00:16:10,639
Brother, will you continue
to talk about money or..

141
00:16:10,716 --> 00:16:12,115
..talk about yourself too?

142
00:16:12,184 --> 00:16:14,049
Dear, what do l tell
you about myself?

143
00:16:14,654 --> 00:16:16,315
lf you insist, let me tell you.

144
00:16:17,923 --> 00:16:22,656
l've become a rich man here.
You remember people used..

145
00:16:22,728 --> 00:16:26,994
..to buy gold chains in the
village.. l buy hotel chains here.

146
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,200
That's great, brother.

147
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:31,728
Thank you.

148
00:16:31,804 --> 00:16:35,001
Listen, l hope you don't have any
problem with the food in the hostel?

149
00:16:35,675 --> 00:16:38,269
lf you have so, then tell me.
l'll send a lunch box from here.

150
00:16:38,678 --> 00:16:41,078
Now enough, brother.
l am very proud of you.

151
00:16:41,681 --> 00:16:45,412
Somebody has to learn from you
to see dreams and fulfill them.

152
00:16:45,685 --> 00:16:48,085
Enough of talks now. Concentrate
on studies, okay?

153
00:16:48,154 --> 00:16:50,418
Okay brother, take care. Bye.

154
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:51,748
Bye.

155
00:16:55,695 --> 00:16:56,753
What is it?

156
00:16:56,829 --> 00:16:58,888
Kishan, there is a limit
for everything.

157
00:17:00,032 --> 00:17:02,694
Hotel chains? Sometimes we don't
have enough of money..

158
00:17:02,768 --> 00:17:05,293
..to buy a cycle chain, you are
talking about hotel chains?

159
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:08,703
Somebody has to learn how
to charade from you.

160
00:17:15,047 --> 00:17:17,777
Ladla! Don Ladla!

161
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,045
We've put him to rest.

162
00:17:21,721 --> 00:17:24,713
What can he do when faced with
Teenie, Meenie and Zeenie?

163
00:17:25,725 --> 00:17:28,387
At the most, he'll watch a Hindi
movie and weep in his mother's lap.

164
00:17:30,062 --> 00:17:33,327
Your values and principles can't
provide a day's meal, Ravi.

165
00:17:34,467 --> 00:17:36,731
What has your values and
principles, that you're willing to..

166
00:17:36,802 --> 00:17:38,736
..risk your life for,
provided you with?

167
00:17:39,405 --> 00:17:42,738
A low-wage cop's job,
an ordinary apartment..

168
00:17:42,808 --> 00:17:45,743
..a pair of khaki uniforms,
and a govt. jeep.

169
00:17:46,412 --> 00:17:50,746
Look! Look at me! This is the same
me and this is the same you.

170
00:17:51,751 --> 00:17:53,810
We've both started off from
this same footpath.

171
00:17:54,353 --> 00:17:57,015
But look at where you stayed behind
and look at where l've reached.

172
00:17:58,424 --> 00:18:00,756
Today, l own buildings, properties,
bank balance..

173
00:18:00,826 --> 00:18:02,760
..bungalows, cars, what do you have?

174
00:18:06,031 --> 00:18:07,225
l have my mother with me.

175
00:18:16,442 --> 00:18:17,500
To hell with his mom!

176
00:18:17,777 --> 00:18:19,768
l've been watching this movie
only till this scene..

177
00:18:19,845 --> 00:18:21,779
..for the past 5 years.

178
00:18:22,114 --> 00:18:27,108
Whenever the mom's dialogue comes,
he freezes the screen.

179
00:18:27,186 --> 00:18:28,517
How much more?

180
00:18:34,126 --> 00:18:35,184
Mom!

181
00:18:37,062 --> 00:18:38,791
Son!
- Mom!

182
00:18:38,931 --> 00:18:44,062
Son, freshen up fast, l've cooked
a sweet dish for you.

183
00:18:44,136 --> 00:18:48,539
No, mother. Before that l want
to share a good news with you.

184
00:18:48,808 --> 00:18:50,400
Have you brought home
my daughter-in-law?

185
00:18:50,476 --> 00:18:53,536
No, mom. lt's a much
bigger good news.

186
00:18:53,813 --> 00:18:56,873
Today, your son has
become a don, mother.

187
00:18:57,216 --> 00:19:00,344
l'm don.
- Really?!

188
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:03,877
'l'm don, l'm don.'

189
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:07,020
'l'm.. l'm.. l'm don.'

190
00:19:15,434 --> 00:19:18,835
Mother! You'll come back,
won't you, mother?

191
00:19:19,438 --> 00:19:23,499
You'll feed me sweetmeats with
your own hands, won't you?

192
00:19:24,109 --> 00:19:26,509
Don! Don! Don!

193
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:28,840
We've traced the girls. We've
received information that..

194
00:19:28,914 --> 00:19:31,041
..they're in Goa.

195
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:54,196
l love the beach. l love the
sand. l love the beauty.

196
00:19:54,406 --> 00:19:58,866
l love the pain. l love the rain.

197
00:19:59,612 --> 00:20:07,212
From here to there. The ocean
stretches. The ocean..

198
00:20:07,887 --> 00:20:15,419
A fire burns somewhere
within my heart.

199
00:20:16,161 --> 00:20:20,291
lt's a wet climate,
my love is young.

200
00:20:20,366 --> 00:20:24,359
lt's a wet climate,
my love is young.

201
00:20:24,436 --> 00:20:28,304
My fantasies are full of fun.

202
00:20:28,574 --> 00:20:30,633
From here to there.

203
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:32,901
From here to there.

204
00:20:32,978 --> 00:20:34,912
The ocean stretches. The ocean..

205
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,244
The ocean..

206
00:20:38,918 --> 00:20:40,112
The ocean..

207
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,521
l love the beach. l love the sand.

208
00:20:45,124 --> 00:20:47,058
l love the beauty.

209
00:20:47,259 --> 00:20:51,923
l love the pain. l love the rain.

210
00:20:54,199 --> 00:20:56,064
C'mon, let the music play.

211
00:20:56,268 --> 00:20:57,929
C'mon, let the time away.

212
00:20:58,537 --> 00:21:00,129
We've got the party going on.

213
00:21:00,339 --> 00:21:02,136
We're going to rock
the night away.

214
00:21:02,274 --> 00:21:04,208
Everybody feeling high.

215
00:21:04,276 --> 00:21:06,210
Reaching up to touch the sky.

216
00:21:06,478 --> 00:21:08,343
Come and get what
you want to, baby.

217
00:21:08,414 --> 00:21:10,211
Your chance is passing by.

218
00:21:10,282 --> 00:21:14,082
The crazy weather is
driving me crazy.

219
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:18,618
lt has filled my heart
with a fire of passion.

220
00:21:20,626 --> 00:21:24,494
The crazy weather is
driving me crazy.

221
00:21:24,697 --> 00:21:28,497
lt has filled my heart
with a fire of passion.

222
00:21:28,567 --> 00:21:32,697
The moment is just right.
Even the air is intoxicated.

223
00:21:32,972 --> 00:21:36,703
The moment is just right.
Even the air is intoxicated.

224
00:21:36,976 --> 00:21:40,969
My fantasies are full of fun.

225
00:22:10,342 --> 00:22:14,142
The lightning of love
makes me restless.

226
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,678
l feel like kissing
the fluttering lips.

227
00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:24,487
The lightning of love
makes me restless.

228
00:22:24,757 --> 00:22:28,557
l feel like kissing
the fluttering lips.

229
00:22:29,028 --> 00:22:32,759
lt's a pleasant story.
There are no distances.

230
00:22:33,032 --> 00:22:37,025
lt's a pleasant story.
There are no distances.

231
00:22:37,102 --> 00:22:40,697
My fantasies are full of fun.

232
00:22:43,242 --> 00:22:47,508
From here.. - l love the beach.
- To there.. - l love the beauty.

233
00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:51,640
The ocean stretches. The ocean..

234
00:22:51,717 --> 00:22:59,055
A fire burns somewhere
within my heart.

235
00:22:59,792 --> 00:23:04,058
From here to there.

236
00:23:04,129 --> 00:23:08,395
The ocean stretches. The ocean..

237
00:23:09,068 --> 00:23:10,535
C'mon, let the music play.

238
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,594
C'mon, let the time away.

239
00:23:13,072 --> 00:23:14,664
We've got the party going on.

240
00:23:15,074 --> 00:23:16,735
We're going to rock
the night away.

241
00:23:17,076 --> 00:23:18,737
Everybody feeling high.

242
00:23:19,078 --> 00:23:20,807
Reaching up to touch the sky.

243
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,809
Come and get what
you want to, baby.

244
00:23:23,082 --> 00:23:25,073
Your chance is passing by.

245
00:23:27,219 --> 00:23:29,084
What babes, man!

246
00:23:31,824 --> 00:23:36,090
One was.. The other was..

247
00:23:38,097 --> 00:23:40,361
Babu, is your stomach alright?
- Yes.

248
00:23:40,432 --> 00:23:41,831
Then why are you making such noises?

249
00:23:42,101 --> 00:23:45,502
Those girls, pal..
- Yeah! Those girls.. Hey!

250
00:23:46,371 --> 00:23:47,429
Hey!

251
00:23:48,107 --> 00:23:49,165
Catch it! Catch it!

252
00:23:59,585 --> 00:24:00,643
Come here!

253
00:24:06,391 --> 00:24:10,259
Are you drunk?
- No!

254
00:24:10,395 --> 00:24:11,862
What are you doing with him, Babu?

255
00:24:12,131 --> 00:24:14,725
l was taking him to brother Kishan.

256
00:24:15,134 --> 00:24:18,399
Do you know he stole
again, yesterday?

257
00:24:19,138 --> 00:24:22,733
You should be ashamed, Hari! You've
made Kishan's life hell.

258
00:24:22,808 --> 00:24:25,800
He can't meet anybody. Everybody
assumes him to be you.

259
00:24:25,878 --> 00:24:29,541
Obviously they'll assume so.
We're like Ram and Shyam, the twins.

260
00:24:30,883 --> 00:24:34,410
By the way, do you
have a twin sister?

261
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,354
Sorry!
- Hold this!

262
00:24:38,824 --> 00:24:41,224
Keep this money and get
out of this locality.

263
00:24:41,293 --> 00:24:43,158
Because of you, Kishan
avoids meeting dad.

264
00:24:44,163 --> 00:24:47,428
Mom and dad have passed away.

265
00:24:47,766 --> 00:24:49,427
l'm talking about my dad!

266
00:24:50,302 --> 00:24:53,703
l don't have a problem. C'mon,
let's meet your dad.

267
00:24:55,174 --> 00:24:56,436
lt's the alcohol talking.

268
00:24:57,442 --> 00:24:59,171
Babu, the farther he stays from me..

269
00:24:59,244 --> 00:25:01,235
..the closer will Kishan be to me.

270
00:25:05,317 --> 00:25:07,251
Why did you tell her that l'm drunk?

271
00:25:08,187 --> 00:25:12,521
Kishan, don't fool around
with this girl.

272
00:25:13,192 --> 00:25:17,185
Anuradha is such an innocent
girl and you're fooling her..

273
00:25:17,262 --> 00:25:20,595
..by cooking up stories about twins.

274
00:25:21,733 --> 00:25:27,262
l'm not fooling her, pal. She had
once seen me in this condition.

275
00:25:27,606 --> 00:25:31,337
l got scared. l told her
that l've a twin brother.

276
00:25:32,878 --> 00:25:35,210
Since then, Kishan has
to pretend to be Hari.

277
00:25:37,349 --> 00:25:40,682
lf l tell her the truth,
then she'll leave me.

278
00:25:40,752 --> 00:25:47,214
Fine! Then just handover 50% of
the money that she gave you.

279
00:25:48,894 --> 00:25:49,952
You..!

280
00:25:53,232 --> 00:25:57,293
lt's pretty small. Here's
a big one. Very good!

281
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,240
Pass it! Pass!

282
00:26:04,309 --> 00:26:05,367
Hey! Shell out the money.

283
00:26:05,444 --> 00:26:07,503
Why are you shouting?
What's the balance?

284
00:26:07,579 --> 00:26:10,514
The old due. - Then add this
to it and collect it later.

285
00:26:10,582 --> 00:26:11,981
But where will l search for you?

286
00:26:12,251 --> 00:26:13,912
Hey! You don't have
to search for me.

287
00:26:14,253 --> 00:26:17,450
Even the kids know me.
Am l knew here?

288
00:26:17,589 --> 00:26:18,647
What nonsense are you talking?

289
00:26:18,724 --> 00:26:19,850
Sir, does everybody out here
know you? - What is it?

290
00:26:19,925 --> 00:26:21,256
Do you know him?

291
00:26:22,527 --> 00:26:23,585
Who are you?

292
00:26:23,662 --> 00:26:27,928
Look, l am what l am. You can
assu me whatever you want to.

293
00:26:28,467 --> 00:26:31,265
But please keep him in mind.

294
00:26:31,403 --> 00:26:37,399
l've come to take him and
l'll surely take him back.

295
00:26:37,476 --> 00:26:39,273
He was a wrestler! A wrestler!

296
00:26:39,344 --> 00:26:42,279
The only thing l don't
understand is that..

297
00:26:42,347 --> 00:26:44,281
..why someone outside
Goa's looking for you?

298
00:26:44,816 --> 00:26:46,477
Tell me something, have l
fooled anybody outside Goa?

299
00:26:46,551 --> 00:26:49,281
No!
- Then where has he sprung up from?

300
00:26:49,354 --> 00:26:50,753
You should have looked at him.

301
00:26:50,822 --> 00:26:53,017
He was looking like a
bull from Jaffrabad.

302
00:26:53,292 --> 00:26:55,283
With a staff in his hand and
wearing a wraparound..

303
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,419
..he looked like an
illiterate villager.

304
00:26:58,297 --> 00:27:00,288
Are you sure it was my photo?

305
00:27:00,832 --> 00:27:03,300
l can identify your photo
even with my eyes closed.

306
00:27:04,303 --> 00:27:05,429
l hope it wasn't Hari's photo.

307
00:27:17,582 --> 00:27:21,313
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry, l'm late.
- Did l say anything?

308
00:27:22,721 --> 00:27:26,316
You didn't but then it's my
duty to explain myself.

309
00:27:29,461 --> 00:27:34,330
Here, l was after this. Take it.

310
00:27:37,936 --> 00:27:43,670
Anu, how many times have l told
you not to give money to Hari?

311
00:27:46,812 --> 00:27:48,336
By giving him money, you're not..

312
00:27:48,413 --> 00:27:51,007
..going to mend his ways,
are you? He'll not change.

313
00:27:54,486 --> 00:27:59,355
He's a stain. He's like a birthmark.

314
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:03,685
He's stuck to my body.
He's like my shadow.

315
00:28:05,097 --> 00:28:08,362
l know. l can understand
your problem.

316
00:28:08,967 --> 00:28:10,764
You brothers are so different
from each other.

317
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:14,362
He doesn't have any manners, and..

318
00:28:14,439 --> 00:28:16,634
..you're the epitome
of good manners.

319
00:28:19,511 --> 00:28:26,041
Thanks, Anu. You're the only one
who understands my problem.

320
00:28:26,385 --> 00:28:27,716
Thanks. Thank you.

321
00:29:33,985 --> 00:29:39,184
What did he say? Staff, wraparound,
bull. Oh hell!

322
00:29:39,925 --> 00:29:41,984
Brother! - Mr. White.

323
00:29:43,462 --> 00:29:46,454
Hey dhoti! - Mr. Black

324
00:29:46,531 --> 00:29:47,589
Stop!

325
00:29:47,666 --> 00:29:50,066
Stop! - l'm not going to stop!
- l'm Gopi!

326
00:29:50,602 --> 00:29:52,593
My Kishan is again
into some problem!

327
00:29:52,737 --> 00:29:56,605
Brother Kishan, listen to me!

328
00:29:57,809 --> 00:30:00,801
Are you going to stop or not?
- Hey move!

329
00:30:01,213 --> 00:30:06,810
Stop! Else l'm going to kidnap
you. l'm warning you!

330
00:30:07,486 --> 00:30:08,544
Brother Kishan!

331
00:30:16,495 --> 00:30:17,553
What's that noise?

332
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:22,830
Kishan! Stop him!

333
00:30:24,102 --> 00:30:26,627
Kishan, stop!

334
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:29,097
No!

335
00:30:29,174 --> 00:30:32,041
You.. listen to me!

336
00:30:33,645 --> 00:30:35,510
No! No!

337
00:30:38,717 --> 00:30:41,584
l should be keeping a dog. A dog!

338
00:30:41,853 --> 00:30:46,916
Hey! Somebody help me! Somebody
save me from this dog!

339
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,522
Hey brother!

340
00:30:52,864 --> 00:30:55,128
Moti! Tommy!

341
00:30:56,134 --> 00:31:01,595
Moti, hush! Go, dear. Go back home!

342
00:31:02,874 --> 00:31:03,932
Go!

343
00:31:04,609 --> 00:31:09,546
Hey! My wraparound!

344
00:31:09,814 --> 00:31:13,147
Hey! My wraparound!

Hey you!

352
00:32:02,934 --> 00:32:07,598
Run for your lives!

353
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,865
lt took just four slaps
to get rid of them.

354
00:32:13,745 --> 00:32:16,612
Thanks!
- What? - Thank you.

355
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:21,211

356
00:32:21,286 --> 00:32:24,619
What?!
- My wraparound.

357
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:29,291
Sorry, can you drop
me home for that?

358
00:32:29,628 --> 00:32:34,622
Drop you home?
- Please! - Ok.

359
00:32:35,233 --> 00:32:38,293
Where have you brought me?
ls this your house or a hotel?

360
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:40,099
This is my house.

361
00:32:40,639 --> 00:32:42,038
You don't seem to
be a native of Goa.

362
00:32:42,307 --> 00:32:44,775
Have you come here
looking for ajob?

363
00:32:44,843 --> 00:32:49,371
l've.. l've come to look for you.

364
00:32:50,181 --> 00:32:52,706
He's not here. He must've gone to
Mumbai. To try in the movies.

365
00:32:52,784 --> 00:32:56,652
No, no. He's very much here.
l've enquired.

366
00:32:56,721 --> 00:32:58,313
But l couldn't find his address.

367
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:01,052
Then will you search for him
with this photo? - Yes!

368
00:33:01,793 --> 00:33:03,192
By the way, where are you put up?

369
00:33:03,662 --> 00:33:08,861
Actually l.. nowhere.
l'm a stranger in this city.

370
00:33:08,933 --> 00:33:12,061
Then listen to me. You're going
to stay in this hotel.

371
00:33:12,337 --> 00:33:13,736
l'll tell the manager.

372
00:33:14,005 --> 00:33:18,942
No, no. You've treated me so well.

373
00:33:19,277 --> 00:33:22,678
Thank you very much for that.
Moreover, l can't be a..

374
00:33:22,747 --> 00:33:26,080
..burden on you just a few
minutes after knowing you.

375
00:33:26,151 --> 00:33:28,745
Oh c'mon! What burden
are you talking about?

376
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,151
You can stay here, you know.

377
00:33:30,221 --> 00:33:33,019
Just for the sake of convenience.
- What?

378
00:33:33,425 --> 00:33:37,225
Yes, you'll stay right here and
l'll help you look for him.

379
00:33:41,032 --> 00:33:42,761
'Me and my wife, bought a TV.'

380
00:33:42,834 --> 00:33:45,428
'We got a scratch card
and won a prize.'

381
00:33:45,704 --> 00:33:47,763
'Four nights and three
days of free stay.'

382
00:33:51,242 --> 00:33:53,233
Oh my God!

383
00:33:53,311 --> 00:33:55,370
Mr. Takdir Singh from Ludhiana.

388
00:34:10,328 --> 00:34:11,454
Absolutely!

389
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:15,131
Shankara, start off!

390
00:34:17,736 --> 00:34:19,260
You've become so fat!

391
00:34:19,871 --> 00:34:21,463
Sir, please follow me.

393

Hello, room service?

394

'We're going on a summer holiday.'

395
00:34:30,281 --> 00:34:32,215
Mummy!

396
00:34:32,283 --> 00:34:33,750
Oh my God!

Oh Shaky, are you alright!

lt's ok, sir. No problem.

399
00:34:41,292 --> 00:34:44,420
The charges for this will
be added to your bill.

400
00:34:45,363 --> 00:34:47,354
How much has it cost?
- Only 15000.

401
00:34:48,767 --> 00:34:50,758
Add it to the bill, he'll pay it.

402
00:34:51,903 --> 00:34:57,967
Won't you? Won't you?
- Ok!

403
00:34:58,777 --> 00:35:01,109
Dad, this is Kishan.
- Are you sure?

404
00:35:05,984 --> 00:35:07,383
Have a seat! Sit!
- Ok.

405
00:35:07,452 --> 00:35:08,851
Be comfortable.
- Ok, sir.

406
00:35:10,388 --> 00:35:14,449
l keep hearing about your twin
brother's antics from Anuradha - Yes.

407
00:35:16,795 --> 00:35:18,319
That's the reason
l cracked the joke.

408
00:35:22,467 --> 00:35:24,799
Hello!
- Hello, this is Brown here.

409
00:35:26,137 --> 00:35:28,799
Tell me, inspector. What
made you think of me?

410
00:35:30,074 --> 00:35:33,009
My wife has made purchases worth
Rs.5 lakhs from your shop.

411
00:35:33,077 --> 00:35:34,339
Yes, absolutely.

412
00:35:34,813 --> 00:35:37,543
And she didn't pay.
- l didn't ask either.

413
00:35:38,016 --> 00:35:41,213
That's your big-heartedness.
But business is business.

414
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,812
l'll send you the Rs.5
lakh in two days. Cash.

415
00:35:44,889 --> 00:35:46,481
No problem.

416
00:35:48,493 --> 00:35:49,551
Your dad's moustache is too big.

417
00:35:49,828 --> 00:35:51,489
Did you see, Kishan?
- Yes!

418
00:35:52,363 --> 00:35:56,891
A cop's job, a govt. salary.
- l see.

419
00:35:57,168 --> 00:36:00,228
And royal tastes.

420
00:36:02,307 --> 00:36:04,571
His wife had made purchases
worth Rs.5 lakhs.

421
00:36:05,844 --> 00:36:10,440
And now my friend wants to
settle the account in cash.

422
00:36:11,249 --> 00:36:14,844
lt's very obvious that he must've
received a huge bribe.

423
00:36:14,919 --> 00:36:17,444
All corrupt souls! l hate
them! l hate them!

424
00:36:17,856 --> 00:36:20,848
Dues worth Rs.5 lakhs! l get
jittery even if l keep a due..

425
00:36:20,925 --> 00:36:24,326
..of Rs.2 with my grocery.

426
00:36:24,863 --> 00:36:27,525
That's because you perspire
all day to earn your living.

427
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:28,861
Who perspires?

428
00:36:31,269 --> 00:36:33,533
You, idiot! Who else? Your!

429
00:36:34,873 --> 00:36:37,865
What has happened to me?
l forget my own job.

430
00:36:37,942 --> 00:36:40,410
Then how'll l remember the name?
- Of whom?

431
00:36:41,546 --> 00:36:43,878
The one who's giving
Rs.5 lakh in cash.

432
00:36:44,082 --> 00:36:49,076
Oh! Him? His name is inspector
Brown. Brown.

433
00:36:49,153 --> 00:36:52,088
Ok!
- Will you remember it now? - Yes.

434
00:36:52,423 --> 00:36:56,416
Now, l'll remember his name such
that even he'll remember me.

435
00:36:56,895 --> 00:37:00,888
Who?
- Mr. Brown..

436
00:37:11,643 --> 00:37:14,908
What is it?
- Call your master.

437
00:37:14,979 --> 00:37:18,574
Which master?
- Mr. Brown.

438
00:37:18,917 --> 00:37:21,249
Can't you see? l'm Mr. Brown.

439
00:37:22,253 --> 00:37:25,120
Ridiculous! You look very
different when naked.

440
00:37:25,523 --> 00:37:28,048
We're from Global Plumbing.
- So?

441
00:37:28,326 --> 00:37:29,918
We received a complaint.
- From whom?

442
00:37:29,994 --> 00:37:31,928
Your wife.
- Against whom?

443
00:37:33,131 --> 00:37:35,258
Not against anyone. About
a leakage in the bathroom.

444
00:37:35,934 --> 00:37:36,992
Leakage in the bathroom?

445
00:37:38,469 --> 00:37:39,527
Shall we start the work?

446
00:37:41,205 --> 00:37:42,934
l think l have seen you somewhere.

447
00:37:43,942 --> 00:37:45,933
Thank you very much, sir.
Thank you very much.

448
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:49,002
l'm the model for my company's
ad campaign.

449
00:37:51,416 --> 00:37:52,474
These are the kind of photos
they click of mine.

450
00:37:52,617 --> 00:37:56,553
ln fact, last year, l received
the plumber of the year award.

451
00:37:56,621 --> 00:37:59,419
Amazing! lnfact whenever somebody..

452
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:00,957
ln fact, whoever meets me tells me..

453
00:38:01,025 --> 00:38:03,960
..that they've seen
me somewhere before.

454
00:38:04,963 --> 00:38:08,228
lt's like as if l've these
supernatural powers.

455
00:38:08,299 --> 00:38:12,360
Natural! Super! Where's
the bathroom? - There!

456
00:38:14,973 --> 00:38:16,304
Where have l seen him?

457
00:38:16,708 --> 00:38:20,166
Just now! You saw him with me
when you opened the door.

458
00:38:20,712 --> 00:38:23,977
Ok! l've seen him with you.

459
00:38:26,451 --> 00:38:27,713
lt broke! Leakage!

460
00:38:28,987 --> 00:38:30,249
Mr. Brown!

461
00:38:31,389 --> 00:38:33,380
Mr. Brown!
- What's this? What have you done?

462
00:38:33,458 --> 00:38:35,255
Do one thing! Do one thing!

463
00:38:35,326 --> 00:38:36,987
You..
- Shall l call the fire brigade?

464
00:38:37,061 --> 00:38:38,995
Why? Do you want to give
them a water connection?

465
00:38:39,063 --> 00:38:40,530
Have you gone crazy? Stand here.

466
00:38:40,598 --> 00:38:41,724
Hold this and stand here.

467
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,991
Who me?
- Else what? Me?

468
00:38:44,068 --> 00:38:45,729
Who's the plumber out here?
- You. - Exactly!

469
00:38:46,004 --> 00:38:48,268
Who has to go to the top and shut
off the machine? - You. - Well done!

470
00:38:48,339 --> 00:38:50,671
And who'll block the
pipe till then? - Me!

471
00:38:50,742 --> 00:38:52,676
Well done! Well done! Full

Now hold it and stand here.
Not a drop should fall. You..

473
00:38:55,546 --> 00:38:58,014
Not a drop should fall or else
aunt Shabana will be upset.

474
00:38:58,082 --> 00:38:59,140
l'm warning you!

475
00:38:59,217 --> 00:39:00,548
Stay put over there, don't move.

476
00:39:00,752 --> 00:39:03,220
Mr. Brown, don't let
even a drop fall.

477
00:39:03,621 --> 00:39:05,088
Do you know what aunt Shabana says?

478
00:39:05,356 --> 00:39:07,620
You should save two buckets
of water everyday.

479
00:39:08,026 --> 00:39:11,086
Ok! Ok! Now hurry up and
shut off the machine.

480
00:39:11,162 --> 00:39:12,686
l do everything in a hurry.

481
00:39:19,037 --> 00:39:22,302
Hey! Shut off the machine, plumber!

482
00:39:27,445 --> 00:39:29,174
Hey plumber!

483
00:39:34,052 --> 00:39:35,383
Plumber! Plumber! Plumber!

484
00:39:35,653 --> 00:39:38,053
The day l lay my hands on you,
l'll make you clean..

485
00:39:38,122 --> 00:39:40,317
..all the toilets in all
the prisons across lndia.

486
00:39:40,391 --> 00:39:44,054
He made me stand in the bathroom
and burgled all..

487
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:48,064
..the five rooms in my house.
Bloody plumber! - Greetings, sir!

488
00:39:50,401 --> 00:39:52,062
He looks worried!

489
00:39:56,407 --> 00:39:58,341
Sir, did you find that thief?

490
00:40:05,416 --> 00:40:08,817
Forgive me. Do you sell salt?

491
00:40:10,088 --> 00:40:11,817
Then why are you sprinkling
salt on my wounds?

492
00:40:12,423 --> 00:40:15,085
Or does my angry face
look like boiled eggs..

493
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:17,753
..that tempts you to
sprinkle salt on it?

494
00:40:18,096 --> 00:40:20,087
The burglary took place in my house.

495
00:40:20,431 --> 00:40:23,093
Do you want to announce
it to the entire world?

496
00:40:23,701 --> 00:40:28,104
l'm a police officer. l can nab
the thief whenever l want.

497
00:40:28,172 --> 00:40:31,107
No, inspector. We've just come
to ask if you've seen..

498
00:40:31,175 --> 00:40:34,633
..this man anywhere.

499
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:54,462
Are you checking my
general knowledge?

500
00:40:56,134 --> 00:40:59,126
lsn't he the same guy? The
model for Global Plumbing?

501
00:40:59,737 --> 00:41:03,138
Plumber of the year, the
nephew of aunt Shabana.

502
00:41:03,741 --> 00:41:05,732

one who saved me that day.

512
00:41:53,658 --> 00:41:55,387
He's the lndian Arnold.

513
00:41:55,726 --> 00:41:57,717
Hey! Nice to meet you,
man. That's cool.

514
00:41:58,196 --> 00:42:01,188
Hey Tania! - You should throw a
party tonight, man. What do you say?

515
00:42:01,265 --> 00:42:03,665
Yeah man! We've got
to rock the party!

516
00:42:04,335 --> 00:42:06,735
We've got to toast for Tania
and for this gentleman. Yes.

517
00:42:06,804 --> 00:42:09,796
C'mon guys!
- Yeah!

518
00:42:27,225 --> 00:42:28,692
You make me fall again!

519
00:42:30,361 --> 00:42:32,420
Just waiting for the game.

520
00:42:33,764 --> 00:42:37,291
Just wait a little while, you'll
bring back my smile.

521
00:42:37,368 --> 00:42:40,428
Stole my heart for ten reasons.

522
00:42:40,504 --> 00:42:44,440
Stole my heart for ten reasons.
- You stole my heart from me.

523
00:42:44,642 --> 00:42:48,237
Stole my heart for ten reasons.
- You stole my heart from me.

524
00:42:48,312 --> 00:42:52,646
Stole my heart for ten reasons.
- You stole my heart from me.

525
00:43:03,594 --> 00:43:06,461
Just chill.. chill.. just chill.

526
00:43:06,664 --> 00:43:10,259
Just chill.. chill.. just chill.

527
00:43:10,334 --> 00:43:12,461
Just chill!

528
00:43:20,278 --> 00:43:23,543
Where are you going, my lndian idol?

529
00:43:23,681 --> 00:43:27,481
l'm going to the room.
- Sit here.

530
00:43:28,286 --> 00:43:29,810
Please. Leave me, please.
- Why?

531
00:43:29,887 --> 00:43:33,414
lsn't my room yours? Am l not yours?

532
00:43:33,891 --> 00:43:36,359
Or are you not mine?

533
00:43:36,427 --> 00:43:37,621
lt is not so.

534
00:43:38,562 --> 00:43:41,690
Gopi, you've such a nice body.

535
00:43:43,367 --> 00:43:48,361
And a very native smell.
Give me one deep kiss.

536
00:43:48,439 --> 00:43:53,376
What?
- Kiss! A kiss!

537
00:43:53,844 --> 00:44:00,841
See, you're drunk.

538
00:44:01,452 --> 00:44:03,716
Why don't you understand? Fool!

539
00:44:03,788 --> 00:44:04,846
lt's Saturday today.

540
00:44:05,923 --> 00:44:07,515
Would've you kissed me
had it been a Sunday?

541
00:44:07,591 --> 00:44:12,858
No way! - lt's Saturday night
fever, Gopi. Give me a kiss.

542
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:14,329
Don't trouble me further.

543
00:44:14,598 --> 00:44:17,726
Look, l'll make the dog chase
you otherwise. - No!

544
00:44:18,736 --> 00:44:21,728
Give me! Why are you
acting like this?

545
00:44:23,341 --> 00:44:26,742
God! Are you breathing your last?

546
00:44:27,945 --> 00:44:29,742
C'mon kiss, pal.

547
00:44:30,014 --> 00:44:32,414
What are you doing with a stranger?

548
00:44:32,883 --> 00:44:37,877
Gopi, tell me something.
Are you a stranger..

549
00:44:40,891 --> 00:44:47,558
Leave me! - Kiss me! You idiot!
Stupid! llliterate!

550
00:44:47,965 --> 00:44:49,364

00:44:49,433 --> 00:44:51,424
..just because l flirted
a little with you!

552
00:44:51,769 --> 00:44:56,900
You just threw me! You denied
me! You rejected me!

553
00:44:57,575 --> 00:45:02,444
How dare you! How dare you! Useless!

554
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:18,792
Praise be to the almighty!

555
00:45:39,016 --> 00:45:41,484
lt seems it's madam's
birthday today.

556
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:48,617
Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday to you.

Oh yeah!

00:47:36,133 --> 00:47:40,593
Neither do you have
shame nor modesty.

575
00:47:40,871 --> 00:47:45,069
You've forgotten traditions
and customs.

576
00:47:45,543 --> 00:47:50,071
Neither do you have
shame nor modesty.

577
00:47:50,147 --> 00:47:54,607
You've forgotten traditions
and customs.

578
00:47:54,952 --> 00:47:58,945
l haven't seen a woman
like you before.

579
00:47:59,023 --> 00:48:03,619
Greetings! Greetings!

Play it! Play it! Play
it with your heart!

583
00:48:19,977 --> 00:48:23,640
Yet again l remember the trees,
the river bank, the village.

584
00:48:23,714 --> 00:48:26,979
The anklets tinkled and
the skirts swayed.

585
00:48:27,051 --> 00:48:30,782
l haven't been able to forget the
kohl and the earrings, yet.

586
00:48:30,854 --> 00:48:31,912
Oh yeah!

587

Greetings! Greetings! Greetings!

602
00:50:06,817 --> 00:50:10,412
Mr. Gopi, do you want to drink more?

603
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:15,882
Why? Do you have a problem?

604
00:50:16,093 --> 00:50:19,893
Problem? That too, me? Never!

605
00:50:20,297 --> 00:50:23,698
Moreover, you only had told
me just now amidst all..

606
00:50:23,767 --> 00:50:28,898
..that l don't have
shame or modesty.

607
00:50:29,707 --> 00:50:33,108
Then why should such a
girl have a problem.

608
00:50:34,244 --> 00:50:36,838
Oh! l wasn't talking
about you alone.

609
00:50:36,914 --> 00:50:38,779
l was talking about all
your friends also.

610
00:50:38,849 --> 00:50:42,785
Don't defend yourself.
You were targeting me.

611
00:50:43,253 --> 00:50:46,780
You weren't singing, Gopi.
You were mocking at me.

612
00:50:48,125 --> 00:50:51,720
Because the place where
you come from..

613
00:50:51,795 --> 00:50:53,922
..doesn't approve of my lifestyle.

614
00:50:53,997 --> 00:50:55,055
lsn't it?

615
00:50:56,266 --> 00:51:03,399
But it's ok. l think
it's not your fault.

616
00:51:05,809 --> 00:51:07,071
You can't see all this.

617
00:51:08,812 --> 00:51:14,341
You can't see that this girl has
been so lonely since childhood.

618
00:51:17,755 --> 00:51:19,746
Without a mother, this child
has only been showered..

619
00:51:19,823 --> 00:51:21,347
..with money by her father.

620
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:26,287
He never told her a bedtime story.

621
00:51:28,766 --> 00:51:32,759
ln four days, even you came
to the conclusion that..

622
00:51:32,836 --> 00:51:35,964
..she's a rich spoilt brat.
And mocked at me so much.

623
00:51:38,842 --> 00:51:43,836
Gopi, we so easily accuse people
of being bad from a distance.

624
00:51:45,115 --> 00:51:47,777
Do we ever make an attempt
to get closer to them and..

625
00:51:47,851 --> 00:51:49,842
..find out why they're bad,

626
00:52:08,405 --> 00:52:11,932
Air Sahara welcomes all it's
passengers arriving from Mumbai.

627
00:52:17,815 --> 00:52:18,873
Where's our informer?

628
00:52:19,216 --> 00:52:21,343
When does he inform about
his whereabouts?

629
00:52:21,819 --> 00:52:24,014
Did you inform him
that we're coming?

630
00:52:25,355 --> 00:52:27,346
That constable was nagging me.

631
00:52:27,424 --> 00:52:29,289
l told him to stop nagging
else l'll beat him to pulp.

632
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:31,486
Who got in? Who got in?! Hey!

633
00:52:31,895 --> 00:52:34,022
Keep it in!
- Hey! Blackberry! Who are you?

634
00:52:34,097 --> 00:52:35,155
Passenger! Passenger!

635
00:52:36,967 --> 00:52:39,902
How are you?
- Find out his name.

636
00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:42,837
Just a moment, l'll tell you. Tulsi.

637
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:45,367
l'm not lrani, l'm Goan.

638
00:52:45,442 --> 00:52:47,239
l'm the like the basil that
grows at your doorstep.

639
00:52:48,846 --> 00:52:49,904
l'm like the basil that
grows at your doorstep?

640
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:53,843
What happened? - That's the same
song that my mother used to sing.

641
00:52:54,251 --> 00:52:55,377
What an emotional fool!

642
00:52:55,452 --> 00:52:57,386
l'm the like the basil that
grows at your doorstep.

643
00:52:57,454 --> 00:53:00,981
But she passed away without telling
me about that doorstep.

644
00:53:01,992 --> 00:53:04,927
We haven't come here to
look for doorsteps.

645
00:53:05,262 --> 00:53:07,924
We've come here for these
three girls. - Yes!

646
00:53:09,399 --> 00:53:12,266
Being a girl yourself, you're
hitting on girls.

647
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:15,600
Whom are you calling a girl? - You!
You moustached girl. - Shut up!

648
00:53:15,873 --> 00:53:19,866
l'm known as fire. - You should
be known as rose. Black rose.

649
00:53:19,943 --> 00:53:21,069
Have you seen these
three girls anywhere?

650
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:26,881
These?! l dropped them just now.

651
00:53:28,285 --> 00:53:31,277
Where?
- Where?! - Why should l tell you?

652
00:53:31,355 --> 00:53:32,947
Hey!
- Hands up!

653
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:36,417
Where?

654
00:53:49,506 --> 00:53:53,442
Come! Come! Come!

655
00:53:53,510 --> 00:53:56,308
Where? Where? Where?

656
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:58,314
Here it is.
- Where is it?

657
00:53:59,917 --> 00:54:02,442
That building in front.
Just behind that.

658
00:54:02,519 --> 00:54:03,918
Building? ls that a building?
- Sorry, l'm used to speaking..

659
00:54:03,987 --> 00:54:05,921
..English, that's why.

660
00:54:05,989 --> 00:54:07,251
Those ruins. They went
behind those ruins.

661
00:54:07,324 --> 00:54:08,450
Behind those ruins?
- Go!

662
00:54:11,061 --> 00:54:12,119
Let's sneak up quietly and..

663
00:54:12,195 --> 00:54:13,594
Sir, your luggage. - Did l ask
you to take out my luggage?

664
00:54:13,931 --> 00:54:15,125
Did l ask you to take
out your luggage?

665
00:54:15,198 --> 00:54:16,995
l've kept it! l've kept it!

666
00:54:17,935 --> 00:54:20,335
Wait here, we'll be back in 5 min.

667
00:54:20,404 --> 00:54:24,067
Ok! Ok!
- Follow me! Follow me!

668
00:54:25,142 --> 00:54:26,200
ls there a way through this?

669
00:54:26,276 --> 00:54:29,006
lt's that way, be careful
else you'll fall.

670
00:54:29,079 --> 00:54:30,137
Ok. Follow me!

671
00:54:32,950 --> 00:54:35,680
Why do all these intelligent
people come to Goa?

672
00:54:36,486 --> 00:54:37,544
Because..

673
00:54:46,964 --> 00:54:48,022
Let's dance!

674
00:55:07,384 --> 00:55:09,375
That's ok! Let's try again.

675
00:55:18,395 --> 00:55:21,057
That was much better but you're
still lacking precision.

676
00:56:03,306 --> 00:56:04,364
Yeah!

677
00:56:10,647 --> 00:56:11,705
Hi!
- Hello!

678
00:56:12,649 --> 00:56:15,447
Tell me clearly if you are
an informer or a duffer.

679
00:56:15,519 --> 00:56:18,044
Today because of you my
luggage was stolen..

680
00:56:18,121 --> 00:56:20,453
..and you expect me to
be in this one suit?

681
00:56:20,657 --> 00:56:25,060
l am such a big don and a

And you know what his name is?
- What?

683
00:56:27,330 --> 00:56:29,127
What? - His name is Phunsi.
- lt's not Phunsi.

684
00:56:29,199 --> 00:56:31,064
l will chain you so tight..
l will chain you so tight..

685
00:56:31,134 --> 00:56:35,070
..that the companies
that make glues..

686
00:56:35,138 --> 00:56:40,132
..would make you their
brand ambassador.

687
00:56:40,210 --> 00:56:42,075
You dared to steal in
an inspector's house..

688
00:56:42,145 --> 00:56:44,613
That too an inspector like me

689
00:56:45,148 --> 00:56:46,274
He stole in an inspector's house.

690
00:56:46,483 --> 00:56:48,280
How does it bother you! Tell
me why you came here.

691
00:56:48,351 --> 00:56:50,683
Someone stole in my home as well.
- l see.

692
00:56:51,088 --> 00:56:53,818
You are also an inspector?
- Not an inspector. l am Ladla.

693
00:56:54,491 --> 00:56:56,755
Ladla (dear one)? Whose?

694
00:56:57,494 --> 00:57:00,088
My name is Ladla.
- lf your name is Ladla..

695
00:57:00,163 --> 00:57:03,496
..what's his name? Dalda
(clarified butter)?

696
00:57:04,634 --> 00:57:07,694
Look, we came to Goa in search
of these three girls.

697
00:57:08,105 --> 00:57:10,630
These three girls. And when..
- l see.

698
00:57:10,707 --> 00:57:12,174
Girls are three and you are two.

699
00:57:15,178 --> 00:57:17,112
So these girls have
stolen your luggage.

700
00:57:17,514 --> 00:57:19,505
l will keep this photo. l'll
inform you when we get them.

701
00:57:19,583 --> 00:57:22,313
No, you don't need to search them.
- Why?

702
00:57:22,519 --> 00:57:24,714
They had stolen, hadn't they?
- Yes. No. No.

703
00:57:25,522 --> 00:57:27,114
When we came out of the airport..

704
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:29,124
..the one who stole our luggage..

705
00:57:29,192 --> 00:57:31,660
..we're looking for him.
- Who's that?

706
00:57:31,728 --> 00:57:34,526
Taxi driver. And his name is..
- Phunsi!

707
00:57:34,598 --> 00:57:38,125
Phunsi! No, no!
- Tulsi! - Yes, Tulsi. - Yes.

708
00:57:38,201 --> 00:57:40,192
Ok. Where's his photo?

709
00:57:41,538 --> 00:57:42,596
l don't have his photo.

710
00:57:42,672 --> 00:57:43,798
l'm getting confused.

711
00:57:46,209 --> 00:57:48,734
You don't have to look for
those in this photo.

712
00:57:48,812 --> 00:57:49,870
No, you don't have to.

713
00:57:50,147 --> 00:57:53,207
lnstead l've to look for the
one who's not on the photo.

714
00:57:53,283 --> 00:57:54,341
Yes, that's right!

715
00:57:55,352 --> 00:57:56,546
Jesus Christ!

716
00:57:57,554 --> 00:57:59,545
The one who's photo isn't there..
- lsn't there..

717
00:57:59,623 --> 00:58:01,557
He has to be looked for.
- Yes.

718
00:58:01,625 --> 00:58:03,149
Because he has stolen your luggage.
- Yes, that's right.

719
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:07,291
And l don't have to look for
those on the photo? - No!

720
00:58:07,364 --> 00:58:09,559
Brilliant! - But even they've
stolen something, isn't it?

721
00:58:12,569 --> 00:58:16,562
Yes, they have. They've stolen
jewellery worth 25 crores.

722
00:58:18,575 --> 00:58:21,237
My mother's..
- Where's your mother?

723
00:58:21,778 --> 00:58:23,769
Mother's not there.
- Who was wearing the jewellery?

724
00:58:24,181 --> 00:58:26,240
No one was. lt was kept in a box.

725
00:58:26,583 --> 00:58:28,244
Where was the box?
- lt was in the cupboard.

726
00:58:28,318 --> 00:58:30,445
And where was the cupboard?
- At home.

727
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:31,578
And mom?
- She passed away.

728
00:58:31,655 --> 00:58:33,384
From where? She passed
by the cupboard?

729
00:58:38,195 --> 00:58:41,392
My mother passed away
from this world.

730
00:58:41,464 --> 00:58:46,265
Oh! l'm very sorry! Very sorry,
Mr. Ladla! Very sorry!

731
00:58:47,204 --> 00:58:48,603
Now l'm able to understand
things clearly.

732
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:51,398
Your mother passed away.

733
00:58:51,808 --> 00:58:53,799
These three girls came
for the funeral.

734
00:58:53,877 --> 00:58:56,209
Yes, they came for the funeral.
- And left with your mom's jewellery.

735
00:58:56,279 --> 00:58:58,213
Yes!
- And you were in a fix when your..

736
00:58:58,281 --> 00:59:00,215
..mother's jewellery went missing..
- Yes.

737
00:59:00,283 --> 00:59:02,217
..and you became bankrupt.
- Yes, l became bankrupt.

738
00:59:02,285 --> 00:59:04,753
Then you caught the 1pm flight and
came here at two. - Yes, l did.

739
00:59:04,821 --> 00:59:08,279
At 3 pm, the taxi driver
robbed you and went home.

740
00:59:08,358 --> 00:59:10,223
Yes, he went home.
- And at five..

741
00:59:10,293 --> 00:59:12,284
..you came to my office
to file a complaint.

742
00:59:12,362 --> 00:59:15,229
Yes, l did. - Stop saying
mother every now and then.

743
00:59:15,298 --> 00:59:16,765
Else he'll slip into a coma.

744
00:59:16,833 --> 00:59:19,233
Hey! Your voice is thinner
than the hands of a watch..

745
00:59:19,302 --> 00:59:22,294
..and you dare to threaten me!

746
00:59:22,639 --> 00:59:25,301
Please track down my luggage,
inspector.

747
00:59:25,642 --> 00:59:28,634
l've been wearing the
same suit all day.

748
00:59:28,778 --> 00:59:31,246
What do you think? l change
my dress everyday..

749
00:59:31,314 --> 00:59:32,906
..before coming to office?

750
00:59:33,583 --> 00:59:35,983
l've been wearing this same uniform
for the past 15 years.

751
00:59:36,253 --> 00:59:38,244
See! - Don't know why
everybody who come..

752
00:59:38,321 --> 00:59:40,255
..here have their luggage stolen!

753
00:59:41,391 --> 00:59:43,256
Please take down my complaint!

754
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:45,787
What do l write in the
complaint?! Yes?

755
00:59:46,263 --> 00:59:47,457
Every information is incomplete.

756
00:59:48,598 --> 00:59:51,260
The other day a guy with
a staff came. - l see.

757
00:59:51,334 --> 00:59:53,268
He was showing me the
photo of one person..

758
00:59:53,336 --> 00:59:54,394
..and searching for another.
- l see.

759
00:59:54,671 --> 00:59:56,332
Both of you get out of here, now.

760
00:59:56,406 --> 00:59:57,668
We're leaving.
- Let me think! - Ok!

761
00:59:57,741 --> 01:00:00,471
l have a headache.
- But l should get the dress. - Out!

762
01:00:00,543 --> 01:00:03,341
Ok! But l should get back my dress.
- Hey! Not you!

763
01:00:03,813 --> 01:00:06,281
You shouldn't get up!
Plumber of the year!

764
01:00:06,349 --> 01:00:08,340
l'll break your legs if you get up!

765
01:00:08,418 --> 01:00:09,680
l'll cane you!

766
01:00:11,288 --> 01:00:12,687
Hello, Mr. Brown!

767
01:00:18,295 --> 01:00:20,286
l'd have sent that 5
lakhs to your house..

768
01:00:20,363 --> 01:00:22,297
..what was the need to come here?

769
01:00:22,365 --> 01:00:23,889
l don't keep petty cash here!

770
01:00:27,904 --> 01:00:31,305
Mr. Brown, l haven't come here
to ask about the 5 lakhs..

771
01:00:31,374 --> 01:00:34,366
..but to introduce my
gem of a son-in-law.

772
01:00:35,712 --> 01:00:38,374
Anu!
- Kishan!

773
01:00:38,848 --> 01:00:40,372
This is Kishan!

774
01:00:40,450 --> 01:00:42,384
He's Kishan! But he told
me he's a plumber!

775
01:00:42,452 --> 01:00:45,717
Plumber?!
- No! He's Kishan.

776
01:00:45,789 --> 01:00:47,723
No, pal. He's a plumber.

777
01:00:47,791 --> 01:00:50,726
He's actually a thief.
He burgled my house.

778
01:00:50,927 --> 01:00:53,919
He's not the one. - That must
be his twin brother, Hari.

779
01:00:53,997 --> 01:00:55,726
He's the one who cons people.

780
01:00:55,799 --> 01:00:57,858
Then what does he do? - He bears
the punishment for his misdeeds.

781
01:00:57,934 --> 01:01:00,732
Then where's he?
- That's yourjob to find out.

782
01:01:00,804 --> 01:01:02,863
We're going to take him along.
- That means l've to leave him.

783
01:01:03,406 --> 01:01:04,464
Absolutely!

784
01:01:04,541 --> 01:01:06,532
Firstly, he's innocent and
secondly, he's my son-in-law.

785
01:01:06,609 --> 01:01:08,736
lf you're going to take him then
who's going to be in the lock-up.

786
01:01:08,945 --> 01:01:10,003
Where will l get that Hari?

787
01:01:10,347 --> 01:01:11,746
Uncle, are you the cop or us?

788
01:01:11,815 --> 01:01:13,407
Have you caught the wrong guy or us?

789
01:01:13,483 --> 01:01:15,417
Has the burglary happened
in your house or ours?

790
01:01:15,485 --> 01:01:17,350
Will you nab the real thief or us?

791
01:01:25,762 --> 01:01:30,426
Ms. Tania!
- What is it now?

792
01:01:31,501 --> 01:01:32,900
Hasn't the manager told you that..

793
01:01:32,969 --> 01:01:36,962
Yes, he did tell me that you
don't want to meet me.

794
01:01:38,775 --> 01:01:41,903
But l wanted to meet you
before leaving. - Why?

795
01:01:42,779 --> 01:01:44,440
ls there anything left to say?

796
01:01:44,914 --> 01:01:48,645
No, Tania. You're misunderstanding
me.

797
01:01:49,986 --> 01:01:52,386
lf l'd told you something wrong in
my drunken stupor, last night..

798
01:01:52,455 --> 01:01:54,980
..then kindly forgive me for that.

799
01:01:56,659 --> 01:02:00,527
l can never misbehave with you.

800
01:02:01,798 --> 01:02:06,462
lt's just that l couldn't bear
to see you in that state.

801
01:02:08,004 --> 01:02:10,939
Liquor is not the cure for
loneliness, Ms. Tania.

802
01:02:11,674 --> 01:02:15,667
ln fact, liquor makes one
all the more lonely.

803
01:02:17,814 --> 01:02:19,406
Those who encourage you
to succumb to liquor..

804
01:02:19,482 --> 01:02:21,814
..aren't your friends
but your enemies.

805
01:02:23,953 --> 01:02:26,478
You've everything by God's grace.

806
01:02:27,824 --> 01:02:31,419
God forbid, if you lose
it all in the future..

807
01:02:31,494 --> 01:02:34,622
..then these friends of yours
won't be there with you either.

808
01:02:36,032 --> 01:02:38,626
Learn to identify true
friends, Ms. Tania.

809
01:02:40,904 --> 01:02:41,962
l'll take your leave now.

810
01:02:45,041 --> 01:02:46,838
Gopi!
- Yes?

811
01:02:47,977 --> 01:02:52,038
Where are you going?
- Back to my village.

812
01:02:52,715 --> 01:02:56,048
Back to your village? But
you've promised somebody.

813
01:02:58,054 --> 01:03:00,113
l'll seek forgiveness from God.

814
01:03:01,057 --> 01:03:02,649
Who all will you seek
forgiveness from?

815
01:03:02,992 --> 01:03:04,459
You were apologising
to me sometime back..

816
01:03:04,527 --> 01:03:07,052
..now you're even going
to apologise to God.

817
01:03:07,597 --> 01:03:11,192
What to do, madam? l'm in a fix.

818
01:03:13,002 --> 01:03:15,470
How can the one who helps others
find the right path..

819
01:03:15,538 --> 01:03:17,529
..be in a fix himself?

820
01:03:20,076 --> 01:03:24,069
Gopi, you're not the one
who's trapped. lt's me.

821
01:03:24,681 --> 01:03:32,144
What? - ln your simplicity. ln
your honesty. ln your love.

822
01:03:35,024 --> 01:03:38,084
Pappu has passed his exams! Kishan!

823
01:03:38,161 --> 01:03:39,890
Pappu has passed his exams!

824
01:03:39,963 --> 01:03:43,023
l've tracked down the girls. They
are staying in GK resort.

825
01:03:43,099 --> 01:03:44,566
Mind blowing! C'mon!

826
01:03:49,506 --> 01:03:50,564
Hello! May l help you, sir?

827
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:51,698
Yes.
- l need a room.

828
01:03:52,108 --> 01:03:54,576
Single or double?
- Two singles.

829
01:03:55,578 --> 01:04:01,107
Why don't you take a double?
- Who needs the room?

830
01:04:02,519 --> 01:04:03,986
You, sir.
- Who's paying?

831
01:04:04,988 --> 01:04:06,046
You, sir.

832
01:04:06,122 --> 01:04:08,249
Then why are you giving
me free advice?

833
01:04:08,525 --> 01:04:10,925
Open your register.
- How long will you be staying, sir?

834
01:04:11,794 --> 01:04:13,591
Normally we don't wait
for more than a second.

835
01:04:13,663 --> 01:04:15,927
But sometimes we've
to go in for 7 years.

836
01:04:15,999 --> 01:04:18,593
Stay back! He meant stay back.
- Yes.

837
01:04:18,668 --> 01:04:19,726
You can leave that area blank.

838
01:04:19,802 --> 01:04:20,928
Right, sir.
- Thank you.

839
01:04:21,004 --> 01:04:22,062
Thank you!
- Thank you.

840
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:26,670
Come along, idiot.
- Please attend the counter.

841
01:04:26,943 --> 01:04:28,069
l'll teach you a lesson or two.

842
01:04:33,550 --> 01:04:35,074
'White! Mr. White!'

843
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:45,951
Kishan.
- Yes. - Huh!

844
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:58,098
ls it?

845
01:04:58,975 --> 01:05:00,033
Babu!
- Yes?

846
01:05:00,710 --> 01:05:01,768
Don't come in between.

847
01:05:01,844 --> 01:05:02,902
Go!

848
01:05:06,916 --> 01:05:12,183
Kishan! Hey Kishan!
Please wait! Wait!

849
01:05:18,795 --> 01:05:22,196
Where do l hide from this wrestler?
He's after my life!

850
01:05:33,009 --> 01:05:35,671
Hey Kishan! l know you're here.

851
01:05:36,613 --> 01:05:37,671
Look..

852
01:05:44,153 --> 01:05:47,748
Look Kishan, please come
out wherever you are.

853
01:05:48,024 --> 01:05:49,150
l've come to take you back.

854
01:05:51,894 --> 01:05:53,156
l should've kept a dog!

855
01:05:53,229 --> 01:05:56,630
Had l kept a dog then you wouldn't
have been able to catch me.

856
01:05:56,699 --> 01:05:59,759
Police! Police! - There's a
small station in the village.

857
01:06:00,036 --> 01:06:01,697
You can find the cops there.

858
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:06,031
Hey wrestler, please
leave me! Please!

859
01:06:06,109 --> 01:06:09,306
Even if l lose my wraparound, this
time l'll surely take you along.

860
01:06:09,379 --> 01:06:10,846
Why are you after me?

861
01:06:11,781 --> 01:06:15,774
l'm not after you. Your
dad was after my dad.

862
01:06:15,985 --> 01:06:17,714
To find out the truth about you.

863
01:06:17,787 --> 01:06:20,722
What rubbish are you talking?
My dad has my complete address.

864
01:06:20,923 --> 01:06:22,720
And how did you and your
dad come into this?

865
01:06:23,059 --> 01:06:26,051
Come along with me to Hoshiarpur.
l'll tell you everything there.

866
01:06:26,663 --> 01:06:28,062
By the way, what's the matter?

867
01:06:28,131 --> 01:06:31,794
lt's a 25 year old case.
- Case? What case?

868
01:06:32,001 --> 01:06:33,059
Court case.

869
01:06:34,203 --> 01:06:37,070
Which court?
- Hoshiarpur court.

870
01:06:38,074 --> 01:06:41,407
But how am l concerned with
a case between two fathers.

871
01:06:41,678 --> 01:06:43,407
Because you're his
only heir, brother.

872
01:06:44,747 --> 01:06:45,805
Heir?
- Yes.

873
01:06:46,082 --> 01:06:48,073
What am l getting?
- Land.

874
01:06:49,018 --> 01:06:53,011
How much will it be worth?
- Rs.25000!

875
01:06:54,691 --> 01:06:57,751
A land worth Rs.25000? Do you
expect me to bring it down here?

876
01:06:57,827 --> 01:07:00,762
That's why l'm taking you there.
You've to come along with me.

877
01:07:00,830 --> 01:07:03,424
No, l'm not coming.
- You have to.

878
01:07:03,766 --> 01:07:06,234
Are you trying to use force? Are
you a cop? Do you have a warrant?

879
01:07:06,302 --> 01:07:07,360
Am l your father's property?

880
01:07:08,705 --> 01:07:09,763
Hey! What are you doing?!

881
01:07:16,245 --> 01:07:18,236
Are you going to ask me
for a warrant, Kishan?

882
01:07:20,116 --> 01:07:22,778
l'm a devotee of Lord Hanuman.

883
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:26,120
He had set fire to Lanka
without a warrant.

884
01:07:26,723 --> 01:07:28,782
He had lifted the Drona
hill without a warrant.

885
01:07:29,125 --> 01:07:32,117
You must hardly be weighing
40-50 kg. - 70kg!

886
01:07:32,328 --> 01:07:35,991
l'll carry you up to Hoshiarpur
in my palm. l swear on Lord Ram!

887
01:07:37,266 --> 01:07:40,861
Wrestler! Wrestler!
- Are you coming along with me?

888
01:07:43,940 --> 01:07:45,464
Pack your bags and be ready.

889
01:07:46,809 --> 01:07:48,470
l'll return soon. See you!

890
01:07:50,747 --> 01:07:54,877
The rascal is after my life! You
people are having fun, isn't it?

891
01:07:55,151 --> 01:07:57,813
Go out, have a drink and come back.

892
01:07:58,287 --> 01:08:00,278
And see what l do to them.

893
01:08:08,097 --> 01:08:09,826
Ma'am, this is ruby. Original!

894
01:08:10,299 --> 01:08:13,166
Ruby! Very good!

895
01:08:13,770 --> 01:08:14,828
No, no!

896
01:08:16,305 --> 01:08:18,170
Pack this!
- No! No!

897
01:08:18,241 --> 01:08:19,833
Can l show you something in gold?

898
01:08:20,176 --> 01:08:23,304
Gold?! Gold!
- No, no!

899
01:08:24,180 --> 01:08:27,172
Where? Where is the gold? - Yeah.
l will show you. - Bring it..

900
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:28,774
Bring it! Get the gold! Get it!

901
01:08:28,851 --> 01:08:29,909
Car! Mom, l want the car..

902
01:08:29,986 --> 01:08:31,044
No more cars!

903
01:08:31,387 --> 01:08:34,185
You want the car? Take it.

904
01:08:34,257 --> 01:08:38,853
Hey, madam. Pack this also
- No, no!

905
01:08:39,328 --> 01:08:41,193
Where's the gold?
- No, no!

906
01:08:41,264 --> 01:08:44,791
Why's he saying no?
- Because my BP's shooting..

907
01:08:44,867 --> 01:08:46,858
..up on thinking of the bill.

908
01:08:47,203 --> 01:08:50,798
My wife has so much gold that
if she walks the street..

909
01:08:50,873 --> 01:08:54,001
..wearing all her gold then she
would look like a mobile goldmine..

910
01:08:55,011 --> 01:08:58,003
Let it be! Let it be! Pack all this!

911
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:00,878
He'll settle the bills. Won't you?

912
01:09:01,350 --> 01:09:02,408
Won't you?

913
01:09:04,821 --> 01:09:05,879
Look, he agreed.

914
01:09:07,824 --> 01:09:10,816
Oh good Lord! There's Complan
for growing kids..

915
01:09:10,893 --> 01:09:15,227
..but what plan is there
for growing bills.

916
01:09:52,869 --> 01:09:53,927
What are you doing here, dancer?

917
01:09:55,271 --> 01:09:57,262
l am where you are.

918
01:09:58,474 --> 01:10:04,413
Hey macho man!
- Sexy bomb! l like it!

919
01:10:04,881 --> 01:10:07,281
Hey do you come here daily?

920
01:10:07,884 --> 01:10:12,878
No. By the way, if you invite
me , l'll come whenever you..

921
01:10:12,955 --> 01:10:14,081
..want me to.

922
01:10:14,423 --> 01:10:17,290
Which band do you play for?
- How does it matter?

923
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:18,952
l can play it on anybody.
How about you?

924
01:10:19,295 --> 01:10:20,887
As long as somebody doesn't
play it on you..

925
01:10:20,963 --> 01:10:22,021
..you'll never understand.

926
01:10:22,098 --> 01:10:23,963
But you're able to understand,
darling.

927
01:10:24,433 --> 01:10:25,491
Why have you come here?

928
01:10:26,435 --> 01:10:27,959
The same reason for which
you've come here.

929
01:10:29,906 --> 01:10:31,100
Do you think you're Romeo?

930
01:10:32,909 --> 01:10:34,501
Had you been Juliet, then
l would've been Romeo.

931
01:10:34,577 --> 01:10:36,909
But it would've been better
had you been Radha..

932
01:10:36,979 --> 01:10:38,640
..because l'm Kishan.

933
01:10:38,915 --> 01:10:42,908
And l'm Gopi.
- You?! ls this a wrestling ring..

934
01:10:42,985 --> 01:10:44,976
..what are you doing here?
l don't like him.

935
01:10:45,054 --> 01:10:47,989
Ladies, l'm Gopal Murlimanohar
from Hoshiarpur.

936
01:10:48,324 --> 01:10:49,985
How long are you going to be here?

937
01:10:50,059 --> 01:10:51,993
As long as you're here. l'll
leave when you leave.

938
01:10:52,929 --> 01:10:53,987
What are you saying?

939
01:10:54,063 --> 01:10:55,997
Should l wrestle with you
or have fun with them.

940
01:10:56,332 --> 01:10:57,993
Fun? Right!

941
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:00,464
Fun?! Yeah, let's have fun.
- Yeah!..

942
01:11:00,536 --> 01:11:04,996
C'mon, let's go.
- Hey go! l'm Gopi.

943
01:11:05,074 --> 01:11:06,336
He's not going with you!

944
01:11:06,409 --> 01:11:09,003
He's going to come with
me to Hoshiarpur.

945
01:11:09,078 --> 01:11:10,136
C'mon, leave me!

946
01:11:10,212 --> 01:11:12,339
To hell with your Hoshiarpur!
What are you acting smart for!

947
01:11:12,415 --> 01:11:13,473
Have you gone crazy?

948
01:11:13,950 --> 01:11:17,147
You've started fighting
with me on meeting girls.

949
01:11:17,486 --> 01:11:19,954
Look, girls, you can flirt with
him as much as you want to..

950
01:11:20,022 --> 01:11:23,958
..but at the end of the day he's
going with me to Hoshiarpur..

951
01:11:24,026 --> 01:11:26,153
..l've promised your dad.

952
01:11:29,298 --> 01:11:31,562
Kishan! Brother Kishan!

953
01:11:33,235 --> 01:11:35,169
Oh! This is fun!

954
01:11:36,505 --> 01:11:40,965
l'm scared of that staff
wielding guy who keeps..

955
01:11:41,043 --> 01:11:45,980
..stalking me. l think his
mother must've sung..

956
01:11:46,048 --> 01:11:49,575
..songs from horror movies to
him instead of lullabies.

957
01:11:49,986 --> 01:11:51,180
l am fed up of this guy.

958
01:11:52,989 --> 01:11:55,389
Hello, Mr. Kishan!
- You?!

959
01:11:57,393 --> 01:11:58,655
Village!
- Ghost!

960
01:12:01,998 --> 01:12:06,059
Kishan! Kishan! Where are you?!

961
01:12:06,535 --> 01:12:07,593
Goddamn!

962
01:12:13,609 --> 01:12:16,009
This guy is troubling me! He
doesn't even let me visit..

963
01:12:16,078 --> 01:12:17,739
..the toilet in peace.

964
01:12:19,015 --> 01:12:21,074
On one hand these girls are
troubling me for diamonds..

965
01:12:21,417 --> 01:12:24,079
and on the other hand he stands
in my path like an RTO officer.

966
01:12:39,035 --> 01:12:40,229
Don't you have anything
better to do?

967
01:12:40,302 --> 01:12:41,564
You're standing out
here like a statue!

968
01:12:41,637 --> 01:12:45,164
You think l am a part of a herd
that chase me with a staff?

969
01:12:45,241 --> 01:12:47,038
lf you keep scaring me with
that staff of yours then..

970
01:12:47,109 --> 01:12:48,440
..l'll break it one day.

971
01:12:48,511 --> 01:12:50,570
l'm not going to Hoshiarpur
for Rs.25000.

972
01:12:51,047 --> 01:12:53,311
l'm not going to leave behind
millions for dimes.

973
01:12:53,382 --> 01:12:56,112
Have l gone crazy? Am l that stupid?

974
01:12:56,452 --> 01:12:59,114
Do one thing, you keep
that land for yourself.

975
01:12:59,188 --> 01:13:02,646
From me to you. Thank
me for it and leave.

976
01:13:03,059 --> 01:13:04,788
Don't eat my brains!

977
01:13:06,462 --> 01:13:10,592
l would've eaten your brains,
if you had them.

978
01:13:11,467 --> 01:13:13,059
lf you had brains then you
would've celebrated your..

979
01:13:13,135 --> 01:13:15,069
..father's victory.
You would've come..

980
01:13:15,137 --> 01:13:16,661
..with me to Hoshiarpur and
chosen your piece of land.

981
01:13:18,074 --> 01:13:19,268
You would've erected a
memorial for your dad.

982
01:13:23,479 --> 01:13:24,605
What kind of a son are you?

983
01:13:29,085 --> 01:13:31,144
Why are you getting so sentimental
about my dad?

984
01:13:33,089 --> 01:13:36,081
lt's better for me to go along
with you to Hoshiarpur..

985
01:13:36,158 --> 01:13:39,093
..rather than have you
stalking me all day.

986
01:13:39,562 --> 01:13:40,620
Really?!

987
01:13:41,097 --> 01:13:42,359
Will you come with me to Hoshiarpur?

988
01:13:42,698 --> 01:13:46,498
You arrange for the tickets
and l'll pack my bags.

989
01:13:46,569 --> 01:13:49,094
Tickets? We'll go to Bombay
by bus and from there..

990
01:13:49,171 --> 01:13:50,695
..we'll take a train to Hoshiarpur.

991
01:13:50,773 --> 01:13:53,173
No! Bus and trains? No!

992
01:13:53,509 --> 01:13:59,106
We'll take a flight from here
to Delhi. Rs.10000. - 10000?!

993
01:13:59,648 --> 01:14:04,312
Yes. From there, AC train
to Ambala. Rs.5000.

994
01:14:05,121 --> 01:14:07,180
From there a bus.. l won't
travel in a bus.

995
01:14:07,256 --> 01:14:10,123
We'll hire an AC car. At
the rate of Rs.10 per km.

996
01:14:10,192 --> 01:14:12,524
lt'll be Rs.6000. How much?

997
01:14:13,662 --> 01:14:16,324
21000!
- 21000 to go and 21000 to come.

998
01:14:16,398 --> 01:14:18,195
Arrange for that money
and l'll come along..

999
01:14:18,267 --> 01:14:19,325
l don't have that much money?!

1000
01:14:19,735 --> 01:14:21,532
What?! You don't have money? -No.

1001
01:14:21,604 --> 01:14:22,832
Then how'll l come to Hoshiarpur?

1002
01:14:23,405 --> 01:14:25,600
Who promised dad?
- l.

1003
01:14:25,674 --> 01:14:28,541
Who vowed to take me to Hoshiarpur?
- l.

1004
01:14:28,611 --> 01:14:31,136
Then who'll arrange for the money?
- l. - Then?!

1005
01:14:32,481 --> 01:14:34,142
Arrange the money and l
will come to Hoshiarpur.

1006
01:14:35,151 --> 01:14:37,881
lf l arrange the money you'll
come to Hoshiarpur with me?

1007
01:14:37,953 --> 01:14:39,215
Definitely..
- Swear on me.

1008
01:14:41,223 --> 01:14:43,157
l promise that you arrange
for the money ..

1009
01:14:43,225 --> 01:14:45,159
..and l'll go along with
you to Hoshiarpur.

1010
01:14:45,895 --> 01:14:47,157
Ok. l'll go.

1011
01:14:47,763 --> 01:14:48,821
How can you escape so easily!

1012
01:14:48,898 --> 01:14:53,164
And you also promise that you'll
not show me your face..

1013
01:14:53,235 --> 01:14:57,171
..or stalk me till you
arrange for the money.

1014
01:14:58,174 --> 01:15:02,167
Yes, l promise not to stalk
you or show my face.

1015
01:15:02,912 --> 01:15:06,575
Yeah baby!
- Kishan! - What is it?

1016
01:15:06,649 --> 01:15:10,244
Kishan! Kishan!
The mermaids are bathing.

1017
01:15:10,319 --> 01:15:11,616
So should l apply soap on them?

1018
01:15:11,921 --> 01:15:14,185
l meant the girls.
- Which girls?

1019
01:15:14,456 --> 01:15:17,721
The girls who were bathing.
- What! Where are they?

1020
01:15:17,927 --> 01:15:19,360
ln the swimming pool.
- Mind blowing!

1021
01:15:19,428 --> 01:15:21,862
We'll go their to swim and
while swimming we'll

1022
01:15:21,931 --> 01:15:24,195
Befriend them and ask them
where the diamonds are.

1023
01:15:24,266 --> 01:15:25,324
And you think they'll tell you?
- Yes.

1024
01:15:25,401 --> 01:15:26,925
They'll beat you to pulp.

1025
01:15:27,403 --> 01:15:30,201
lf they're swimming in the pool
then we'll clean up their room..

1026
01:15:30,272 --> 01:15:32,206
..by then. - Yes. - Find out
their room no. - Ok.

1027
01:15:32,274 --> 01:15:33,673
Okey. Yes!
l'll ask them right away!

1028
01:15:33,809 --> 01:15:37,540
ldiot! Why will you go and
ask them! Ask the waiter.

1029
01:15:40,216 --> 01:15:42,616
Take it! Pass it on!
- Take it!

1030
01:15:43,719 --> 01:15:45,209
Here! C'mon!

1031
01:15:45,688 --> 01:15:49,215
Pass it here! C'mon!

1032
01:15:52,828 --> 01:15:55,228
C'mon! Get it!
- l'll get it!

1033
01:15:55,297 --> 01:15:56,355
Hey!

1034
01:16:08,777 --> 01:16:10,642
Kishan!

1035
01:16:11,247 --> 01:16:13,238
Why don't you be the
elder brother and..

1036
01:16:13,315 --> 01:16:14,373
..seek one of their hands
in marriage for me.

1037
01:16:14,650 --> 01:16:17,847
Why? - That way we can ask them
to give us the diamonds as dowry.

1038
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:19,319
Shut up! You just
keep on blabbering.

1039
01:16:19,388 --> 01:16:21,788
Kishan! Listen to me! Oh l broke it!

1040
01:16:22,524 --> 01:16:25,254
O my God! Where have they gone man!

1041
01:16:25,327 --> 01:16:30,264
Hey! Move aside! What
kind of a bat is this!

1042
01:16:33,802 --> 01:16:35,394
Why are you breaking that TV?

1043
01:16:37,273 --> 01:16:38,535
They could've hidden it in the TV.

1044
01:16:38,807 --> 01:16:40,934
Then couldn't you switch
on the TV and see.

1045
01:16:42,011 --> 01:16:44,411
Donkey.
- Sorry! Sorry!

1046
01:16:44,780 --> 01:16:47,806
That's the way! l like it!

1047
01:16:50,619 --> 01:16:56,751
No! No! l don't like it!

1048
01:17:06,568 --> 01:17:09,833
Oh my God! l've to renovate
that entire room.

1049
01:17:11,307 --> 01:17:15,767
2.5 lakhs plus 25000.

1050
01:17:16,645 --> 01:17:18,704
You'll have to pay another
3.5 lakhs, sir.

1051
01:17:19,782 --> 01:17:21,306
ln rupees?
- Right, sir.

1052
01:17:26,322 --> 01:17:31,658
Are you ok, sir? - No, man!
l wasn't even in the room.

1053
01:17:31,994 --> 01:17:33,985
l don't even know who broke it.

1054
01:17:34,063 --> 01:17:38,591
But it's your room, sir. - No! lt's
your room. You can keep it.

1055
01:17:38,667 --> 01:17:43,001
Right, sir. But it's in your name.
And the keys are with you.

1056
01:17:44,006 --> 01:17:47,339
The one who has the keys
has to pay the fine.?

1057
01:17:49,812 --> 01:17:51,746
C'mon, hurry up! Get dressed up.

1058
01:17:52,614 --> 01:17:57,415
l'm sure that even when the don comes
he won't find us or the diamonds.

1059
01:17:57,486 --> 01:17:58,680
Oh the diamonds.

1060
01:17:58,754 --> 01:17:59,812
Where are the diamonds?

1061
01:17:59,888 --> 01:18:02,550
lt's in the locker, idiot! C'mon
now, hurry up. - Locker!

1062
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:05,418
Locker!

1063
01:18:20,509 --> 01:18:22,033
Ask the kid to keep quiet,
l'm not able to think.

1064
01:18:22,378 --> 01:18:23,436
Right away!

1065
01:18:28,784 --> 01:18:31,378
l want to play now. lt's mine!

1066
01:18:31,453 --> 01:18:32,715
No, dear. We can keep
it away for now.

1067
01:18:32,788 --> 01:18:34,380
No, it's mine. lt's mine.

1068
01:18:34,723 --> 01:18:35,781
Shut up!

1069
01:18:44,666 --> 01:18:46,395
Hey bandmaster!

1070
01:18:48,070 --> 01:18:50,402
l'll make her dance to my tunes!

1071
01:18:51,073 --> 01:18:53,837
Kid, what's your dad's room no.?

1072
01:18:54,410 --> 01:18:57,573
211!
- Ok!

1073
01:18:59,415 --> 01:19:01,940
211! Now you eat the chocolate and..

1074
01:19:02,151 --> 01:19:04,745
..l'll play with the
police vehicles.

1075
01:19:05,154 --> 01:19:07,486
There's a police siren in that!

1076
01:19:07,623 --> 01:19:09,420
We will scare people with this.

1077
01:19:14,430 --> 01:19:15,488
Who is that?

1078
01:19:15,764 --> 01:19:17,698
Shit!-Hurry!

1079
01:19:24,706 --> 01:19:29,439
Oh God! - Why did the three of us
leave the locker and come here?

1080
01:19:29,511 --> 01:19:30,569
C'mon!

1081
01:19:37,853 --> 01:19:39,445
The bandmaster! Shit!

1082
01:19:43,592 --> 01:19:45,457
Gopi! Brother Gopi!

1083
01:19:50,599 --> 01:19:54,057
What are you turning your
face away for? Am l naked?

1084
01:19:54,603 --> 01:19:56,468
You had made me promise that
l shouldn't show you my..

1085
01:19:56,538 --> 01:19:57,766
..face until l get the tickets.

1086
01:19:58,073 --> 01:20:00,473
Don't bother about that,
l've got the tickets.

1087
01:20:00,676 --> 01:20:02,940
Here, look.
- Really?

1088
01:20:03,212 --> 01:20:04,736
Have l ever lied?

1089
01:20:05,214 --> 01:20:07,478
Moreover, even if you
had taken the money..

1090
01:20:07,549 --> 01:20:10,643
..no one would've given you
flight tickets. - Yes?

1091
01:20:11,887 --> 01:20:13,946
That Anuradha is coming
along with me.

1092
01:20:14,022 --> 01:20:16,149
Actually she hasn't seen
a Goa without the sea.

1093
01:20:16,492 --> 01:20:17,959
lf you want you can
bring Tania along.

1094
01:20:18,026 --> 01:20:19,084
Really?
- Yes.

1095
01:20:19,161 --> 01:20:21,823
That'll be great, brother.
- Great?

1096
01:20:22,164 --> 01:20:25,497
But we'll spend our honeymoon
here in Goa.

1097
01:20:25,567 --> 01:20:26,625
Not in Hoshiarpur.

1098
01:20:27,102 --> 01:20:31,766
You're truly like Lord Krishna.
Naughty and romantic.

1099
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:33,507
lt's paining!
- Forgive me.

1100
01:20:33,575 --> 01:20:36,908
Thank you. You can praise me later.

1101
01:20:37,179 --> 01:20:40,512
l'm in a hurry now. Let's go.

1102
01:20:40,582 --> 01:20:42,174
l'm all set. C'mon! Let's go!

1103
01:20:42,918 --> 01:20:44,510
Where did the bandmaster go?

1104
01:20:44,853 --> 01:20:47,515
We must catch him.
- Yes we should. - Yes, of course.

1105
01:22:20,882 --> 01:22:23,874
Don, my fate is so bad!

1106
01:22:25,153 --> 01:22:27,621
Everybody has to die
someday including me.

1107
01:22:29,291 --> 01:22:31,225
But just see in how many different
ways one can die.

1108
01:22:32,761 --> 01:22:36,629
By train accidents, road accidents,
plane crash. You know?

1109
01:22:37,165 --> 01:22:39,292
Some drown in a ship,
some drown in liquor.

1110
01:22:39,368 --> 01:22:43,361
Some are poisoned to death.
TB, malaria, AlDS, etc.

1111
01:22:43,438 --> 01:22:45,030
There's no dignity in their death.

1112
01:22:45,641 --> 01:22:46,972
Dignity is there in my death.

1113
01:22:47,376 --> 01:22:49,776
l'm going to die in
the hands of a don.

1114
01:22:50,045 --> 01:22:53,640
Don! A don who's going to die a dog's
death at the hands of..

1115
01:22:53,715 --> 01:22:55,307
..the police.

1116
01:22:56,251 --> 01:22:58,651
l meant, instead of dying a
dog's death at the hands..

1117
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:02,247
..of the police, he should
directly be bitten by dogs.

1118
01:23:03,659 --> 01:23:05,650
Who's the dog? - There's neither
a mirror to show you..

1119
01:23:05,727 --> 01:23:07,661
..nor is there any time.

1120
01:23:07,863 --> 01:23:14,393
But Don, l've a final
wish before l die.

1121
01:23:14,870 --> 01:23:16,201
Please fulfill it.

1122
01:23:16,805 --> 01:23:18,204
What's the last wish?

1123
01:23:20,876 --> 01:23:22,400
Mother used to tell me..

1124
01:23:22,678 --> 01:23:23,736
Mother?

1125
01:23:25,013 --> 01:23:26,674
Mother.
- Mother?

1126
01:23:27,015 --> 01:23:31,952
Mother used to tell me that
if there's no way out then..

1127
01:23:33,355 --> 01:23:35,755
..we should watch a movie
at a nearby theatre..

1128
01:23:36,291 --> 01:23:37,952
..then we would surely find a way.

1129
01:23:38,694 --> 01:23:41,686
And there is no theatre nearby.

1130
01:23:43,098 --> 01:23:45,692
And you don't have a VCR..

1131
01:23:45,767 --> 01:23:48,702
But l only have tragic movies..

1132
01:23:48,970 --> 01:23:50,437
l don't want to die laughing anyway.

1133
01:23:51,707 --> 01:23:54,301
lf l cry by seeing those movies..

1134
01:23:55,377 --> 01:23:56,435
..my heart will be rid
of all the burden.

1135
01:23:57,779 --> 01:23:59,713
Maybe even the body would lighten.

1136
01:24:00,182 --> 01:24:01,911
You wouldn't have a difficulty
lifting me up.

1137
01:24:03,251 --> 01:24:06,709
Don, will you show me the film?

1138
01:24:08,457 --> 01:24:13,724
lt's my mother's last wish..
Mother! The last film..

1139
01:24:14,062 --> 01:24:18,726
Don't cry! Switch on the TV..

1140
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:20,734
Play a nice classic movie.

1141
01:24:20,802 --> 01:24:21,996
Play a nice old classic movie.

1142
01:24:24,740 --> 01:24:32,169
You're so nice. You're
so innocent.

1143
01:24:33,749 --> 01:24:37,185
You're so lovely.

1144
01:24:38,153 --> 01:24:44,023
O mother!

1145
01:24:45,093 --> 01:24:50,895
O Mother!

1146
01:24:51,767 --> 01:24:57,501
You're so nice. You're
so innocent.

1147
01:24:58,306 --> 01:25:01,241
You're so lovely.

1148
01:25:01,510 --> 01:25:06,971
O mother!

1149
01:25:07,916 --> 01:25:12,944
O Mother!

1150
01:25:14,122 --> 01:25:16,784
This world..

1151
01:25:16,858 --> 01:25:21,795
Mr. Don! You're crying! l'm leaving.

1152
01:25:21,863 --> 01:25:24,798
No! Where are you going?

1153
01:25:25,801 --> 01:25:27,792
To stop those tears.

1154
01:25:29,471 --> 01:25:36,070
They flow such that there's
no line or valve behind them.

1155
01:25:36,211 --> 01:25:38,076
There's nothing to stop them.

1156
01:25:38,146 --> 01:25:40,808
Oh God! l've even given
up my plumber's job.

1157
01:25:41,483 --> 01:25:45,476
l'm going to look for
a mother for you, don.

1158
01:25:45,554 --> 01:25:49,820
Where will you get her from?
- l'll find her, don.

1159
01:25:49,891 --> 01:25:54,089
l'll get you my mother.
l'm going to die.

1160
01:25:54,229 --> 01:25:56,561
Who'll take care of my mother?

1161
01:25:56,832 --> 01:25:59,027
You're the only one, don. Only you.

1162
01:25:59,835 --> 01:26:03,032
Take good care of my mother, don.
- Mother!

1163
01:26:03,238 --> 01:26:05,035
l'm going!
- Mother!

1164
01:26:05,106 --> 01:26:10,373
Take good care of my mother, don.
- Mother! Mother!

1165
01:26:10,846 --> 01:26:13,440
Mother!

1166
01:26:14,182 --> 01:26:16,377
l'm saved!
- You've driven me crazy..

1167
01:26:16,451 --> 01:26:18,442
Babu
- You've driven me crazy..

1168
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:19,851
You've driven me crazy.. - Babu.

1169
01:26:20,856 --> 01:26:21,982
Aren't you ashamed, naked guy!

1170
01:26:22,390 --> 01:26:25,382
l'm dying at the don's hand and
you're talking a bath out here.

1171
01:26:25,594 --> 01:26:27,585
Get out! Bring all of
them to the airport.

1172
01:26:27,662 --> 01:26:29,323
ln the meanwhile, l'll get
the boarding pass. C'mon! - Ok.

1173
01:26:30,866 --> 01:26:34,199
Who's this?
- lt's me, brother.

1174
01:26:34,269 --> 01:26:36,396
How are you?
- l am fine.

1175
01:26:36,872 --> 01:26:41,468
l had something to tell you.
- Yes, tell me. - l've chosen a guy.

1176
01:26:41,610 --> 01:26:42,872
A really nice guy.

1177
01:26:43,211 --> 01:26:44,610
l want you to meet him.

1178
01:26:44,679 --> 01:26:46,078
Yes, l do have to meet him.

1179
01:26:46,882 --> 01:26:52,081
l'm bringing him and his dad.
Even l want to show him..

1180
01:26:52,153 --> 01:26:55,088
..that my brother is a
big businessman too.

1181
01:26:56,558 --> 01:26:57,889
Very good! Very good!

1182
01:26:57,959 --> 01:26:59,483
When are you coming?
- What do you mean when?

1183
01:26:59,561 --> 01:27:01,495
l'm calling from the airport..
l'm coming right now.

1184
01:27:01,563 --> 01:27:03,224
Mr. Black.

1185
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:13,972
Brother Gopi, please save me..

1186
01:27:14,042 --> 01:27:15,100
What's this new story now?

1187
01:27:16,311 --> 01:27:19,508
Brother Gopi, l have a sister
who studies abroad.

1188
01:27:20,916 --> 01:27:22,907
Whatever l do, l do it
for her, brother Gopi.

1189
01:27:24,920 --> 01:27:26,046
She is getting engaged.

1190
01:27:26,988 --> 01:27:28,319
And they want to come here.

1191
01:27:30,392 --> 01:27:35,455
Brother Gopi, they think
that l am a rich person.

1192
01:27:35,931 --> 01:27:39,196
That l have many hotels. But
the truth is l have nothing.

1193
01:27:41,670 --> 01:27:45,936
lf the groom's family comes
to know that l have nothing..

1194
01:27:47,342 --> 01:27:48,536
..the engagement will break.

1195
01:27:50,412 --> 01:27:54,280
Please save me.
- Buddy, l understood everything.

1196
01:27:54,950 --> 01:27:56,941
Brother Kishan, l understood
everything.

1197
01:27:57,352 --> 01:27:58,944
But you will come to
Hoshiarpur with me..

1198
01:27:59,020 --> 01:28:00,612
..once everything becomes
fine, won't you?

1199
01:28:01,489 --> 01:28:05,152
You have faith on me. l have
complete faith in lord Hanuman.

1200
01:28:05,961 --> 01:28:07,019
l'll try to do something.

1201
01:28:36,625 --> 01:28:37,683
These two guys are here as well?

1202
01:28:39,327 --> 01:28:40,385
Kishan.

1203
01:28:41,262 --> 01:28:42,320
Hi.
- Hi.

1204
01:28:43,131 --> 01:28:45,463
They are here.
- Who is where?

1205
01:28:46,601 --> 01:28:48,535
Ladla.
- Whose ladla (dear one)?

1206
01:28:49,137 --> 01:28:52,334
No body's dear one.
Ladla is his name.

1207
01:28:52,407 --> 01:28:53,601
And you know he is a don. A don.

1208
01:28:53,742 --> 01:28:55,471
How would he harm you?

1209
01:28:55,543 --> 01:28:57,010
And why would he do that?
- Look, l don't have time..

1210
01:28:57,078 --> 01:28:59,137
..to answer so many questions.

1211
01:28:59,414 --> 01:29:01,006
He will kill me the
moment he sees me.

1212
01:29:01,082 --> 01:29:04,017
He will kill you? Why, Kishan?
- Not Kishan, but Hari.

1213
01:29:04,219 --> 01:29:06,483
Hari ran away with their diamonds.

1214
01:29:06,621 --> 01:29:09,021
And these guys are chasing me.
- Then tell those guys..

1215
01:29:09,090 --> 01:29:11,354
..that you are not Hari,
but you are Kishan.

1216
01:29:11,426 --> 01:29:12,484
There's a lot of difference
between..

1217
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:13,549
..saying something and
proving something, Anu.

1218
01:29:14,029 --> 01:29:17,021
Till l don't bring Hari in front
of them, they will think..

1219
01:29:17,098 --> 01:29:19,225
..that l am Hari and
they will chase me.

1220
01:29:19,300 --> 01:29:22,701
And you know l am Kishan. And
l can't bring Hari here.

1221
01:29:22,771 --> 01:29:25,035
No.
- That's why they will kill Kishan..

1222
01:29:25,106 --> 01:29:27,040
..assuming him to be Hari.
What would happen finally?

1223
01:29:27,709 --> 01:29:29,574
What would happen?
- Finally what will happen is that..

1224
01:29:29,644 --> 01:29:33,045
..Kishan will die in Hari's
place in this diamond puzzle.

1225
01:29:33,114 --> 01:29:35,309
And when Hari will be caught
Kishan won't be there.

1226
01:29:35,383 --> 01:29:37,374
Because they had already
killed Kishan. - Yes.

1227
01:29:37,452 --> 01:29:39,044
l hope you understand
what l am saying.

1228
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:41,054
lt's a bit confusing.
- Hari's well-wisher!

1229
01:29:41,790 --> 01:29:43,382
What are you explaining
to her? Explain it to me.

1230
01:29:44,059 --> 01:29:46,050
What!
- Now l got it.

1231
01:29:46,194 --> 01:29:48,185
Hari ran away with my diamonds.
- Correct.

1232
01:29:48,263 --> 01:29:50,060
Now you will hand over Hari to me.

1233
01:29:50,131 --> 01:29:52,065
Or else in this hurry
l might shoot you..

1234
01:29:52,133 --> 01:29:53,395
..assuming you to be Hari.

1235
01:29:55,070 --> 01:29:57,061
Will l get a chance?
- What chance?

1236
01:29:58,139 --> 01:29:59,663
What's the time now?
- Where?

1237
01:30:00,208 --> 01:30:02,472
ln your watch, of course.

1238
01:30:02,744 --> 01:30:03,802
lt's 2 o'clock. - 2.

1239
01:30:04,079 --> 01:30:05,137
2?
- 2.

1240
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:08,340
He might have gone to Bali by now.
- Bali? - Bali?

1241
01:30:08,750 --> 01:30:10,183
Yes, it's his daily program.
- What?

1242
01:30:10,418 --> 01:30:13,216
He meets Kali at 1 o'clock.- Kali.
- He goes to Bali at 2. - Bali.

1243
01:30:13,288 --> 01:30:14,687
There he eats a rice plate at 3.

1244
01:30:16,825 --> 01:30:19,419
l want to go to Bali.
- Do l look like a travel agent?

1245
01:30:19,561 --> 01:30:21,153
Let's do one thing.
Let's go to the port.

1246
01:30:21,362 --> 01:30:23,762
You can catch him there before
he leaves this place.

1247
01:30:24,099 --> 01:30:27,091
lf he escapes to Bali you'd be
left with empty hands. - No.

1248
01:30:27,168 --> 01:30:28,499
l will go to Bali.
- Thank you.

1249
01:30:28,570 --> 01:30:31,232
l will go to Bali.
l won't go bankrupt.

1250
01:30:35,376 --> 01:30:38,106
C'mon! Be careful. Be careful.
There's a gun in my hand.

1251
01:30:39,247 --> 01:30:40,305
Be careful.
- Yes.

1252
01:30:41,449 --> 01:30:42,780
Yes, come.

1253
01:30:43,785 --> 01:30:45,412
Walk faster or else
the ship will leave.

1254
01:30:47,122 --> 01:30:50,114
ls this is the right ship or
you are pulling a fast one?

1255
01:30:50,658 --> 01:30:51,716
You think l am pulling
a fast one on you?

1256
01:30:51,860 --> 01:30:54,727
What are you saying! He's there.
- Who?

1257
01:30:55,330 --> 01:30:57,321
Hari. Hari. He's there.

1258
01:30:57,398 --> 01:30:59,662
Red cap and red jacket.
- Red cap. Red jacket.

1259
01:30:59,734 --> 01:31:01,599
l can see him.
- He is his mother's favorite child.

1260
01:31:03,138 --> 01:31:05,333
He's his mother's favorite
child. Really!

1261
01:31:05,740 --> 01:31:10,234
Stop.
- Hey! l am here.

1262
01:31:10,678 --> 01:31:14,273
l can do it for you. l am as
good as three. Wait here.

1263
01:31:14,549 --> 01:31:18,212
Stop. - You think l am a fool?
- No.

1264
01:31:18,553 --> 01:31:21,147
We will be here. You will go there.

1265
01:31:21,222 --> 01:31:23,554
You will escape to Bali
with your brother Hari.

1266
01:31:23,691 --> 01:31:26,819
You wait here.
We will go there. - Yes.

1267
01:31:26,895 --> 01:31:30,160
Come. Come.
- Be careful. Be careful.

1268
01:31:30,231 --> 01:31:31,892
Ok. Hide your face.

1269
01:31:33,835 --> 01:31:35,826
Down. Down.

1270
01:31:45,914 --> 01:31:48,712
Whoever is there in the red
coat will get Hari's death.

1271
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:53,182
Move aside.

1272
01:32:00,862 --> 01:32:04,195
Something is definitely
wrong. Freak!

1273
01:32:04,799 --> 01:32:06,790
Nothing's wrong, Anu.
l am here only, isn't it?

1274
01:32:07,202 --> 01:32:09,466
See l am the owner of this hotel.

1275
01:32:09,804 --> 01:32:12,534
But this owner will disown
the ownership for a month.

1276
01:32:13,208 --> 01:32:15,540
K.G. Resort will become
G.K. Resort..

1277
01:32:16,277 --> 01:32:20,213
..whose owners will
be Gopi and Kishan.

1278
01:32:39,434 --> 01:32:41,299
'Hey Mr. Black!'

1279
01:32:48,843 --> 01:32:50,572
'Hey Mr. White.'

1280
01:32:52,247 --> 01:32:55,375
'Hey Mr. White, Mr. Black!'

1281
01:33:02,724 --> 01:33:05,659
l have been pushing around the
suitcases since 25 years..

1282
01:33:05,727 --> 01:33:07,718
..but l didn't get to
wear a suit even once.

1283
01:33:07,996 --> 01:33:09,793
And this stick-man came
here half-naked..

1284
01:33:09,864 --> 01:33:11,525
..but today he is roaming
around like a big shot.

1285
01:33:13,001 --> 01:33:14,263
How are you?
- Brother.

1286
01:33:14,802 --> 01:33:16,269
O God! Good to see you.

1287
01:33:17,672 --> 01:33:19,936
Brother, he is Sid.
- Sid, hi. - Hi, Sid.

1288
01:33:20,008 --> 01:33:21,942

How do you do, Mr. Gopi?

1294
01:33:38,493 --> 01:33:39,551
What are you doing?

01:33:39,961 --> 01:33:41,019
Awesome. Awesome look.

Please come.

1305

Thank you.

1306
01:34:57,105 --> 01:34:59,903
What is going on! You changed
the hotel's name..

1307
01:34:59,974 --> 01:35:01,100
You even changed the owner's name.

1308
01:35:01,376 --> 01:35:02,434
What's the matter, Roshan Lal?

1309
01:35:02,510 --> 01:35:06,640
Tanya ma'am, you are corrupting
your family business.

1310
01:35:07,382 --> 01:35:08,440
Everything will be ruined.

1311
01:35:08,516 --> 01:35:10,381
l mean there will be
no credibility left.

1312
01:35:10,451 --> 01:35:11,577
Why don't you understand that?

1313
01:35:11,919 --> 01:35:14,387
Look, Roshan Lal. lt would be far
better if you don't bother..

1314
01:35:14,455 --> 01:35:17,390
..to lecture me about family
business and credibility, ok?

1315
01:35:17,525 --> 01:35:19,652
Or else l will also have
to lecture your wife..

1316
01:35:19,794 --> 01:35:22,592
..about your relation
with that Suzie girl.

1317
01:35:22,864 --> 01:35:24,593
Should l, Roshan Lal?
- Ma'am.

1318
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,058
Suzie.

1319
01:35:35,009 --> 01:35:36,476
Gopi and Kishan are
such good people.

1320
01:35:36,544 --> 01:35:38,409
l am really happy.

1321
01:36:03,971 --> 01:36:06,439
Two heartbeats of the same heart.

1322
01:36:06,774 --> 01:36:09,436
One is Gopi and the
other one is Kishan.

1323
01:36:15,049 --> 01:36:17,040
Two heartbeats of the same heart.

One is Gopi and the
other one is Kishan.

1329
01:36:42,210 --> 01:36:44,770
Two heartbeats of the same heart.

1330
01:36:45,012 --> 01:36:47,674
One is Gopi and the
other one is Kishan.

1331
01:36:48,082 --> 01:36:50,482
lt is unbreakable..

1332
01:36:50,551 --> 01:36:56,148

Come. Come. Welcome. Welcome.

Our story is very unique
and beautiful.

01:37:45,540 --> 01:37:49,806
We are two bodies, but one soul.

1337
01:37:50,912 --> 01:37:55,144
Our story is very unique
and beautiful.

1338
01:37:56,284 --> 01:38:01,085
We are two bodies, but one soul.

1339
01:38:01,289 --> 01:38:03,814
We will stay together forever.

1340
01:38:04,158 --> 01:38:06,558
We will sacrifice our
lives for each other.

1341

We will enjoy the togetherness
of love.

01:39:20,835 --> 01:39:25,829
God brought us together. Brought
happiness in our life.

01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:29,032
We will dance with joy.

1350
01:39:29,110 --> 01:39:39,315
Dance with joy. Dance with joy.

1351
01:39:39,654 --> 01:39:42,248
Two heartbeats of the same heart.

1352
01:39:42,390 --> 01:39:44,984
One is Gopi and the
other one is Kishan.

1353
01:39:45,092 --> 01:39:47,652
Two heartbeats of the same heart.

1354
01:39:47,862 --> 01:39:50,387
One is Gopi and the
other one is Kishan.

1355
01:39:50,931 --> 01:39:53,263
lt is unbreakable..

1356
01:39:53,668 --> 01:39:59,072
lt is unbreakable.. Our
bond is unbreakable.

1357
01:39:59,206 --> 01:40:00,264
Bond.

1358
01:40:00,408 --> 01:40:01,670
Bond.

1359
01:40:01,809 --> 01:40:04,403
Bond.

1360
01:40:04,679 --> 01:40:05,737
Bond.

1361
01:40:05,946 --> 01:40:07,004
Bond.

1362
01:40:07,348 --> 01:40:09,407
Bond.

1363
01:40:10,017 --> 01:40:15,421
Bond.

1364
01:40:15,489 --> 01:40:20,688
Bond.

1365
01:40:20,961 --> 01:40:26,228
Bond.

1366
01:40:26,434 --> 01:40:31,701
Bond.

1367
01:40:37,778 --> 01:40:39,837
l've never seen you
so happy before, dad.

1368
01:40:40,848 --> 01:40:46,115
Yes, son. We lndians go far
away ..

1369
01:40:46,187 --> 01:40:48,712
..and change ourselves..

1370
01:40:50,124 --> 01:40:54,458
..but the lndia inside this
heart never changes.

1371
01:40:55,730 --> 01:40:58,722
lt is a great thing for this lndian
heart to feel happy when..

1372
01:40:58,799 --> 01:41:01,324
..our son or daughter is wed
to a good lndian family.

1373
01:41:01,402 --> 01:41:05,338
lt's a great thing. lt is the
happiest moment of our life.

1374
01:41:05,806 --> 01:41:08,741
l was confident, dad. After
talking to Divya, one can..

1375
01:41:08,809 --> 01:41:11,369
..definitely understand that
she is from a royal family.

1376
01:41:12,747 --> 01:41:14,738
Brother Gopi, the engagement
ceremony was..

1377
01:41:14,815 --> 01:41:16,214
..a super hit one.

1378
01:41:17,151 --> 01:41:19,745
Yes, instead of wearing this suit,
if l would've worn my..

1379
01:41:19,820 --> 01:41:23,153
..loin cloth, then it would've
looked grand and pomp. You..

1380
01:41:26,227 --> 01:41:29,754
Phone..
- Here.

1381
01:41:31,966 --> 01:41:35,493

01:41:57,458 --> 01:41:59,790
Sir, we want to interview you.

1392
01:41:59,927 --> 01:42:02,794
You've got such a big deal,
you took over this hotel..

1393
01:42:02,863 --> 01:42:04,990
We want to know everything
how you did all this, sir.

1394
01:42:05,332 --> 01:42:06,526
Do you want to know everything?

1395
01:42:07,802 --> 01:42:11,329
No problem. There is a room
here. We'll go there.

1396
01:42:11,939 --> 01:42:13,270
We'll wrap up the interview.

1397
01:42:19,814 --> 01:42:21,247
l think l've seen you somewhere.

1398
01:42:21,816 --> 01:42:26,082
Right now. When you were looking
there and turned here..

1399

..you must've seen me. Come, sir.

1400

One minute. There is something
wrong in this..

1401
01:42:32,893 --> 01:42:37,830
..name plate of the resort.
- Name plate? Not at all.

1402
01:42:39,834 --> 01:42:41,358
How did it become GK from KG?

1403
01:42:43,103 --> 01:42:45,094
The owner has changed so
the name also changed.

1404
01:42:45,372 --> 01:42:47,840
What are you saying? The
owner has changed? - Yes.

1405
01:42:47,908 --> 01:42:48,966
Who is the owner now?

1406
01:42:55,850 --> 01:42:58,580
You? You both are owners
of this resort?

1407
01:42:58,652 --> 01:43:00,847
Why did he come here?
- He used to wear a loin cloth..

1408
01:43:00,921 --> 01:43:03,151
..and Mittal got you released
from the jail.

1409
01:43:03,324 --> 01:43:05,383
l was undergoing punishment
because of your confusion.

1410
01:43:05,860 --> 01:43:06,918
By the way you slowly
digested that..

1411
01:43:06,994 --> 01:43:08,154
..five hundred thousand rupees.

1412
01:43:08,529 --> 01:43:11,464
Punishment? - Yes, this inspector
is always confused.

1413
01:43:11,532 --> 01:43:13,864
Shut up! There is
no confusion today.

1414
01:43:14,134 --> 01:43:15,863
lf there isn't any confusion,
why are you here?

1415
01:43:16,136 --> 01:43:17,262
Did you forget the way
to the police station?

1416
01:43:17,471 --> 01:43:19,132
Or you have come here for
the extortion money?

1417
01:43:19,206 --> 01:43:21,606
Look, l am a very good citizen of
this country and l will not..

1418
01:43:21,675 --> 01:43:23,199
..encourage this kind
of illegal activities.

1419
01:43:23,410 --> 01:43:25,344
Extortion money?
Yes.

1420
01:43:25,412 --> 01:43:27,141
l am not here for the
extortion money.

1421
01:43:27,214 --> 01:43:29,205
l am here to investigate two
things.

1422
01:43:29,283 --> 01:43:30,341
Oh, tell me.

1423
01:43:30,417 --> 01:43:33,147
How did the name of this resort
change from KG to GK?

1424
01:43:34,021 --> 01:43:36,615
Three journalists are missing
from this place.

1425
01:43:36,891 --> 01:43:40,156
Missing? But l..
- Newspaper is shut down?

1426
01:43:40,494 --> 01:43:41,552
Newspaper is on.

1427
01:43:41,629 --> 01:43:43,893
So, are you unaware of the fact
that we bought this hotel?

1428
01:43:44,031 --> 01:43:46,226
Bought it? - Yes, do you think
l would've taken it on rent?

1429
01:43:46,634 --> 01:43:49,569
GK.. Gopi Kishan resort. Hello.
- Hello.

1430
01:43:50,504 --> 01:43:52,563
There is something fishy.

Two men and one girl are missing.

1435
01:44:05,119 --> 01:44:07,053
Girl will surely miss a guy, right?

1436
01:44:07,187 --> 01:44:09,917
They are not missing each other,
but three people are missing..

1437
01:44:10,057 --> 01:44:12,389

They had come here.

01:44:24,939 --> 01:44:26,930
There is a complaint about the
journalist, why are you asking me?

01:44:27,074 --> 01:44:28,939
Strange?
- There was a complaint that..

1444
01:44:29,009 --> 01:44:31,341
..three journalists are
missing from here.

1445
01:44:31,946 --> 01:44:34,540
But we didn't complain from here.

..X TV Mr. James in
the police station.

1450

You..
- Hey, shut up!

That's why l have come
here to investigate.

1452
01:44:52,566 --> 01:44:56,969
For such a small matter. For such
a small matter. Go search.

1453
01:44:57,037 --> 01:44:58,971
No! No!
- Why not?

1454
01:44:59,640 --> 01:45:01,972
Brother Kishan..
- Brother?

1455
01:45:04,111 --> 01:45:06,978
So, he is your brother?
- No, he addresses everyone..

Oh, Mr. No! - My name is Brown.

1462
01:45:27,067 --> 01:45:29,331
Okay.. Why are you getting angry?

1463
01:45:29,670 --> 01:45:31,262
You shouldn't get angry so easily.

1464
01:45:31,538 --> 01:45:32,732
Relax, there is some confusion.

1465
01:45:32,806 --> 01:45:34,398
l'll explain everything
to you in brief.

1466
01:45:35,142 --> 01:45:37,167
Not three, but two journalists

Both were girls. One named Khabri
and other named Sting.

There was a problem
between both of them.

1469
01:45:43,017 --> 01:45:46,009
Brother Gopi got angry and
kicked them out of here.

Who is James?

1482
01:46:29,263 --> 01:46:32,460
You've been saying from a long
time that no one is confused.

01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:37,134
Babu.. Babu! Babu.
- Yes, sir.

1484
01:46:37,738 --> 01:46:44,075
Babu, Babu.. take him and leave
him far away from this place.

1485
01:46:44,611 --> 01:46:48,069
Yes, sir. - Far away. -
Come on, sir. - Strange.

ln that jungle
- Kishan..

1487
01:46:50,551 --> 01:46:51,609
From where no one returns.

1488
01:46:59,827 --> 01:47:01,226
Hey, come here!

1489
01:47:02,229 --> 01:47:04,356
No rooms. Hotel full. Go.

01:47:16,844 --> 01:47:18,175
C'mon move away from here.

Hey, you do not recognise the owner!

And on top of that you act smart!

1497

Hey, you may be the owner
of your house, understood?

1498
01:47:23,517 --> 01:47:24,779
lf you talk too much then..

1499
01:47:27,121 --> 01:47:29,385
lt seems some mad
dog has bitten you!

1500
01:47:29,456 --> 01:47:31,321
A mad dog has bitten me?
- Yes.

01:48:05,359 --> 01:48:09,295
Can't you understand?

1511
01:48:09,496 --> 01:48:10,554
You fool!

1512
01:48:12,432 --> 01:48:13,490
G.K. Resorts!

1513
01:48:13,834 --> 01:48:16,826
Hey, you've landed
directly on earth?!

1514
01:48:17,504 --> 01:48:19,233
Did you get struck by lightening?

1515
01:48:19,573 --> 01:48:20,631
Who are you?

01:48:20,774 --> 01:48:22,765

01:48:23,177 --> 01:48:24,235
What?
- Yes.

1518
01:48:24,511 --> 01:48:27,844
When a beggar says that
l can understand..

1519
01:48:28,182 --> 01:48:30,173
..but when l see a lunatic,
it makes me angry..

Then?
- l'm the owner of this resort. K.G.

1523
01:48:37,324 --> 01:48:38,791
You study in K.G?
- Oh!

1524
01:48:38,859 --> 01:48:41,589
ln your place, l'd have graduated
five times by now!

1525
01:48:42,196 --> 01:48:45,723
He's in K.G!
- K.G. stands for Kulbhushan Gupta.

1526
01:48:48,202 --> 01:48:50,261
Okay, okay, okay, so
you are that K.G.

1527
01:48:51,605 --> 01:48:54,267
And these people are fooling you.

1528
01:48:56,210 --> 01:48:59,668
You know them?
- l know everything about them.

1529
01:48:59,813 --> 01:49:00,871
ls it?
- Yes.

1530
01:49:00,948 --> 01:49:04,406
You can reach them through me..

1531
01:49:04,484 --> 01:49:06,213
..and you can even
get them arrested.

1532
01:49:07,487 --> 01:49:11,514
But there is a price for taking
my help. 10,000 only.

1533
01:49:13,827 --> 01:49:18,230
99.. 100.. 10,000 complete.

1534
01:49:18,298 --> 01:49:19,890
Let's go.
- Come here.

1535
01:49:21,501 --> 01:49:24,493
10,000 rupees just to bring
me to the police station?

1536
01:49:25,505 --> 01:49:26,563
You first come inside.

1537
01:49:26,640 --> 01:49:29,370
Great K.G! Sold your
hotel for millions..

01:49:32,779 --> 01:49:33,837
What sweets sir?

1541
01:49:34,381 --> 01:49:35,575
His hotel is not sold, it's stolen.

1542
01:49:35,916 --> 01:49:38,646
Stolen?
- Yes. - Who stole it?

1543

And who are you?

1544
01:49:44,591 --> 01:49:45,785
Tulsi?
- Yes.

1545
01:49:47,261 --> 01:49:48,523
l have heard this name somewhere.

1546
01:49:49,263 --> 01:49:50,423
Where have l heard it?

1547
01:49:51,732 --> 01:49:52,790
Where have l heard this name?

1548
01:49:52,866 --> 01:49:53,924
ln the TV serial.

1549
01:49:54,334 --> 01:49:58,270
The TV serial, 'Kyunki Saas
Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi'..

1550
01:49:58,338 --> 01:50:01,273
..the name of the heroine
in that serial is Tulsi.

1551
01:50:02,009 --> 01:50:04,273
Then what is your name?
- Tulsi.

1552
01:50:04,478 --> 01:50:05,877
Then what is the name of that lrani?

1553
01:50:06,346 --> 01:50:07,938
l told you sir, Tulsi.

1554
01:50:10,884 --> 01:50:12,283
You are trying to confuse me.

1555
01:50:12,619 --> 01:50:13,745
Don't confuse me!

1556
01:50:14,021 --> 01:50:16,012
Hey Brown! Brown!

1557
01:50:16,556 --> 01:50:21,357
My mother! Listen to me! Why
are you listening to him?

1558
01:50:21,495 --> 01:50:25,295
My hotel is destroyed,
l'm destroyed.

1559
01:50:25,365 --> 01:50:27,560
They have stolen my hotel!

1560
01:50:27,634 --> 01:50:29,363
They have turned K.G into G.K.

1561
01:50:32,372 --> 01:50:35,432
Where were you when all
this was happening?

1562
01:50:35,976 --> 01:50:37,910
What do you mean where
l was? l was on a tour.

1563
01:50:39,913 --> 01:50:42,507
Were you on a small tour
or some big tour?

1564
01:50:43,583 --> 01:50:45,915
Hey, how does that matter?!

1565
01:50:46,053 --> 01:50:47,384
lt matters.

1566
01:50:50,324 --> 01:50:52,315
l went to the bathroom in my house..

1567
01:50:52,392 --> 01:50:54,383
..and my house was robbed.

1568
01:50:55,462 --> 01:50:58,329
You left behind your hotel
and went on a tour..

1569
01:50:58,398 --> 01:50:59,524
..your hotel was robbed.

1570
01:50:59,933 --> 01:51:04,393
K.G, you are going through
a bad phase just like me.

1571
01:51:05,072 --> 01:51:07,336
Forget a 5-star, you are not even..

1572
01:51:07,407 --> 01:51:09,602
..worth owning a roadside joint now.

1573
01:51:11,478 --> 01:51:16,415
Now you neither need the police,
me, nor.. - Tulsi.

1574
01:51:16,483 --> 01:51:20,419
You neither need Tulsi nor Aruna
lrani. - Smriti lrani.

1575
01:51:20,487 --> 01:51:21,545
That..
- Don't confuse me.

1576
01:51:22,089 --> 01:51:26,355
Listen to me, forget
a complaint and..

1577
01:51:26,426 --> 01:51:30,556
..show your horoscope to
some good astrologer.

1578
01:51:30,630 --> 01:51:32,029
You're going through a bad phase.

1579
01:51:32,099 --> 01:51:35,034
Oh my God! What kind of a man is he!

1580
01:52:02,796 --> 01:52:05,458

My sister's face is
like a golden bird.

1592
01:53:08,995 --> 01:53:14,524
Nobody's sister in this
world is like my sister.

1593
01:53:14,601 --> 01:53:17,126
Like ajewel.
- Are her eyes.

01:53:17,204 --> 01:53:20,071
Like a pearl..

Let there be no sadness

01:54:34,681 --> 01:54:37,275
This day was destined to come.

1603

You have to go to your
beloved's house.

1604

We'll find some clue..

1621
01:56:07,307 --> 01:56:08,968
..what this racket is about.

1622
01:56:09,643 --> 01:56:12,635
KG, what will people say when
they see us entering like..

1623
01:56:12,712 --> 01:56:16,307
..thieves in the hotel to look
for thieves with an inspector?

1624
01:56:16,716 --> 01:56:18,650
They'll think that thief has
come in the disguise of..

1625
01:56:18,718 --> 01:56:19,912
..an inspector or inspector
in the disguise of thief.

1626
01:56:27,661 --> 01:56:31,654
Come. Come. Keep your
confusion away and..

1627
01:56:31,731 --> 01:56:32,993
..come with me quietly.

1628
01:56:37,203 --> 01:56:40,331
Sir.. - Sir, please, save us.
- Sir please, help us.

1629
01:56:40,407 --> 01:56:41,999
We had come for an interview.
- What is our fault?

1630
01:56:42,075 --> 01:56:44,202
We're media persons. They
beat us up badly.

1631
01:56:50,283 --> 01:56:52,410
We are not giving
you any great news.

1632
01:56:52,952 --> 01:56:55,819
lt is not Gopi Kishan who
has done it, but it is me.

1633
01:56:57,090 --> 01:56:59,354
Till today, this hotel
belongs to you, dad.

1634
01:56:59,826 --> 01:57:02,818
The name and the owner were
changed for some days.

1635
01:57:02,896 --> 01:57:04,158
That's it.
- That's it?!

1636
01:57:04,698 --> 01:57:07,360
Such a big fraud and it
is a small thing for you?

1637
01:57:07,434 --> 01:57:11,700
Possessiveness of a brother to
his sister.. a brother's love..

1638
01:57:11,771 --> 01:57:13,762
..you call this as fraud, dad?

1639
01:57:13,840 --> 01:57:15,774
This is the first time in my life.

1640
01:57:15,842 --> 01:57:16,774
l've known the importance
of relationships.

1641
01:57:17,444 --> 01:57:20,379
The price of your hotel is
nothing compared to that.

1642
01:57:20,780 --> 01:57:22,839
You can keep the hotel
for yourself, dad.

1643
01:57:23,116 --> 01:57:26,051
lt was KG resort earlier, even
today it is yours and..

1644
01:57:26,119 --> 01:57:28,246
.. you will remain
its owner forever.

1645
01:57:35,061 --> 01:57:38,861
Tulsi, there is a chaos all around.

1646
01:57:40,734 --> 01:57:43,066
All the rich people have
become poor here.

1647
01:57:44,003 --> 01:57:48,940
Even l say, don't be greedy.
Stop stealing.

1648
01:57:49,743 --> 01:57:53,474
Tulsi, l am telling you, your
taxi is best for you.

1649
01:57:53,747 --> 01:57:58,150
Even if you earn daily, you will
earn a huge amount. Lottery.

1650
01:57:58,284 --> 01:58:02,744
Lottery. You've won a lottery,

1651
01:58:02,822 --> 01:58:07,759
Tulsi. You've won a lottery.

1652
01:58:08,828 --> 01:58:12,821
Tulsi, you've become a millionaire.

1653
01:58:12,966 --> 01:58:16,834
Brother Gopi, you accompanied
me as my elder brother.

1654
01:58:16,903 --> 01:58:21,101
Our sister got married.
Divya is very fortunate.

1655
01:58:22,041 --> 01:58:25,374
She had only one brother
earlier now she has two.

1656
01:58:26,112 --> 01:58:27,841
Now even l have a brother now.

1657
01:58:28,047 --> 01:58:31,778
Brother, Kishan. lf you address
me as your elder brother..

1658
01:58:31,851 --> 01:58:33,842
..then please listen to me.

1659
01:58:34,521 --> 01:58:39,857
lf one is not greedy and pure
at heart, God favors them.

1660
01:58:42,128 --> 01:58:44,995
You've fulfilled your wish, right?

1661
01:58:45,799 --> 01:58:49,792
Now, l'll do what l wish.
- Yes. - But..

1662
01:58:50,003 --> 01:58:52,801
First you'll come with me
to Hoshiarpur and l'll do..

1663
01:58:52,872 --> 01:58:54,806
..whatever you want me to do.

1664
01:58:54,874 --> 01:58:58,401
lf you escape from us, you'll
leave this place. You!

1665
01:59:00,013 --> 01:59:03,414
Hey, listen. -Hey you! You
were trying to cheat me!

1666
01:59:03,483 --> 01:59:07,886
Hey brother!
- Brother! Don't call me brother.

1667
01:59:08,288 --> 01:59:10,813
This story took me to Bali!

1668
01:59:10,890 --> 01:59:12,949
l don't want a story,
l want the diamonds!

1669
01:59:13,426 --> 01:59:15,087
Bali? Brother! Diamonds?

1670
01:59:15,295 --> 01:59:16,489
Brother, which diamonds
are you talking about?

1671
01:59:16,563 --> 01:59:20,363
Don't ask me, ask him.
By the way, who are you?

1672
01:59:20,967 --> 01:59:22,901
Consider me as his elder brother.

1673
01:59:22,969 --> 01:59:26,962
Who are you? Whose brother are
you? Twins, elder, younger?

1674
01:59:27,040 --> 01:59:28,439
Not twins, but elder.

1675
01:59:28,842 --> 01:59:31,310
But he said twin, he is
elder and he is younger.

1676
01:59:31,377 --> 01:59:33,038
One minute, l'll ask him.

1677
01:59:33,112 --> 01:59:34,909
Brother Kishan, who is younger one?

1678
01:59:35,248 --> 01:59:38,581
l am younger and you are elder.
- Shut up!

1679
01:59:38,852 --> 01:59:40,444
You said that you were elder
and he was younger.

1680
01:59:40,520 --> 01:59:43,512
Why are you shouting?
Why are you shouting?

1681
01:59:43,590 --> 01:59:46,115
Shouting like this will not change
you to elder and him to younger.

1682
01:59:46,192 --> 01:59:48,319
Don't shout. l'll ask him
with shanti (softly).

1683
01:59:48,928 --> 01:59:51,863
Shanti? Who is Shanti?

1684
01:59:51,931 --> 01:59:55,526
Shanti means Aman (peace).
- Aman?

1685
01:59:55,602 --> 01:59:58,127
Tell me one thing clearly,
how many siblings are you?

1686
01:59:58,204 --> 02:00:00,195
Gopi, Kishan, Shanti, Aman?

1687
02:00:00,340 --> 02:00:03,867
No brother, we are only two of
them. Gopi and this is my Kishan.

1688
02:00:03,943 --> 02:00:05,342
Then who is Shanti and Aman?

1689
02:00:06,145 --> 02:00:07,874
You forget them.
- Then twins?

1690
02:00:08,147 --> 02:00:10,411
l am asking him about them, right?

1691
02:00:10,884 --> 02:00:14,217
Brother Kishan, tell
me who are twins?

1692
02:00:14,888 --> 02:00:17,356
Twins? l don't have any twin
brothe r. - He doesn't have.

1693
02:00:17,423 --> 02:00:19,891
You don't interrupt him.
- He is lying.

1694
02:00:19,959 --> 02:00:21,950
Then what is the truth?
- He doesn't have any twin brother.

1695
02:00:22,896 --> 02:00:26,889
When you know the truth, why
are you tormenting him?

1696
02:00:26,966 --> 02:00:29,901
Because his twin brother, who
doesn't exist, has run away..

1697
02:00:29,969 --> 02:00:32,437
..with diamonds worth 250 million.

1698
02:00:33,039 --> 02:00:35,906
Are you nuts? What are you saying?
His twin brother, who doesn't exist..

1699
02:00:35,975 --> 02:00:38,910
..has run away with your diamonds
worth 250 million? Yes. He ran away.

1700
02:00:38,978 --> 02:00:40,912
lt means that
it was him who told me..

1701
02:00:40,980 --> 02:00:42,914
..about his twin brother and ran away
with my diamonds worth 250 million.

1702
02:00:42,982 --> 02:00:45,644
Ask him where his twin brother
is. That means where is he?

1703
02:00:45,919 --> 02:00:47,511
l'll ask you something
that will be final.

1704
02:00:47,654 --> 02:00:50,589
What do you want to know? About
the diamonds or brother?

1705
02:00:50,657 --> 02:00:52,318
Shoot brother, l want the diamonds.

1706
02:00:52,926 --> 02:00:55,918
lf you shoot the brother, how
will you get the diamonds?

1707
02:00:55,995 --> 02:00:58,395
Please, give back my diamonds.

1708
02:00:58,464 --> 02:01:01,592
Please, calm down.
l'll do something.

1709
02:01:01,668 --> 02:01:06,662
Did you take his diamonds?
- No. - Hey, you come down.

1710
02:01:07,073 --> 02:01:10,668
You lied to me?
- Sir, l am not lying.

1711
02:01:11,010 --> 02:01:13,945
Brother Gopi, l am not lying.
Somebody else has..

1712
02:01:14,013 --> 02:01:16,277
..taken his diamonds away
from him. What can l do?

1713
02:01:16,349 --> 02:01:18,943
Brother!
- Those diamonds belong to me!

1714
02:01:19,018 --> 02:01:21,282
The whole world knows that
those diamonds are mine.

1715
02:01:21,487 --> 02:01:24,547
Give the diamonds to me or there'll
be bloodshed all around.

1716
02:01:25,692 --> 02:01:30,095
Yes, even you'll have to
shed your blood, dear.

1717
02:01:34,968 --> 02:01:37,960
Hey fraud, will you give the
diamonds or not or these girls..

1718
02:01:38,037 --> 02:01:41,700
..and your friends will be seen
only in a photograph from now on.

1719
02:01:43,576 --> 02:01:48,377
Come on, give the diamonds
or see these girl dead.

1720
02:01:48,514 --> 02:01:52,177
l am his elder brother.
Tell me what do you want?

1721
02:01:52,251 --> 02:01:56,984
Hey you! Shut up! Stop acting naive.

1722
02:01:57,256 --> 02:01:59,724
This is done by you both.

1723
02:01:59,792 --> 02:02:01,726
Come on, give us the diamonds.
Come on.

1724
02:02:01,995 --> 02:02:03,986
Kishan, why don't you
tell them that this..

1725
02:02:04,063 --> 02:02:05,121
..was done by Hari and not you?

1726
02:02:13,673 --> 02:02:17,006
Brother Gopi, l was going to tell
you everything after Divya's..

1727
02:02:17,076 --> 02:02:19,738
..wedding about these people.

1728
02:02:21,014 --> 02:02:28,079
l was the one who used to lie,
cheat, and swindle.

1729
02:02:30,423 --> 02:02:32,220
l don't have any twin brother.

1730
02:02:36,362 --> 02:02:39,024
l had made a place to hide my sins.

1731
02:02:45,038 --> 02:02:48,030
Anu, please forgive me.
Please, forgive me.

1732
02:02:49,442 --> 02:02:51,569
l never had the courage
to mutter up the truth.

1733
02:02:52,311 --> 02:02:56,179
l had a fear of losing
you. l am sorry.

1734
02:02:57,116 --> 02:02:58,777
l love you very much.

1735
02:03:01,187 --> 02:03:02,313
The diamonds are with me.

1736
02:03:21,074 --> 02:03:24,601
Listen! Apply that!

1737
02:03:26,145 --> 02:03:30,081
Apply! Come here!

1738
02:03:33,619 --> 02:03:34,745
Apply!

1739
02:03:35,688 --> 02:03:38,623
You are tickling me!

1740
02:03:42,628 --> 02:03:50,831
You! l will kill you!
- Hey! Hey Sardar!

1741
02:03:51,437 --> 02:03:55,100
How did you enter our room?!

1742
02:03:55,174 --> 02:03:57,438
How?
- Through the door!

1743
02:03:57,510 --> 02:03:58,841
What do you mean how!

1744
02:03:59,112 --> 02:04:02,104
lf l wouldn't have entered your
room through the door..

1745
02:04:02,181 --> 02:04:06,311
..then.. this.. l would have
lost this stuff worth crores.

1746
02:04:06,385 --> 02:04:08,182
Understood?
- What is this?

1747
02:04:08,521 --> 02:04:14,118
Diamonds. - That means you are
a robber. Thief. Police!

1748
02:04:15,394 --> 02:04:16,725
Hey dwarf!

1749
02:04:17,130 --> 02:04:24,866
Hey dwarf! Sweets are in front of
you and you are looking elsewhere!

1750
02:04:25,271 --> 02:04:28,672
We will share it. What do
you say sister-in-law.

1751
02:04:29,142 --> 02:04:33,806
You idiot! Get out! Get out!

1752
02:04:33,880 --> 02:04:36,144
Otherwise l will open all
the hooks and shout.

1753
02:04:36,482 --> 02:04:38,279
Should l shout?
- No. - Should l shout? - No.

1754
02:04:39,752 --> 02:04:41,686
Save me. Save me. Save me.

1755
02:04:44,757 --> 02:04:45,883
Diamonds!

1756
02:04:46,159 --> 02:04:47,421
Where are the diamonds?

1757
02:04:47,493 --> 02:04:48,892
Where are the diamonds?

1758
02:04:50,163 --> 02:04:52,495
Who's going to wait
for him to recall!

1759
02:04:53,232 --> 02:04:55,166
When his beloved is
drenched in blood..

1760
02:04:55,234 --> 02:04:58,169
..he will recall even
his days in the womb!

1761
02:04:58,237 --> 02:04:59,363
One minute! One minute! One minute!

1762
02:04:59,438 --> 02:05:00,496
l'm being able to recall something.

1763
02:05:02,241 --> 02:05:06,177
Engagement.. marriage..
- Marriage..

1764
02:05:06,245 --> 02:05:08,645
..palanquin.. songs.. and..

1765
02:05:08,915 --> 02:05:13,318
Hey short circuit! Sing the
song for your father-in-law!

1766
02:05:13,386 --> 02:05:17,254
Give me the diamonds. Or l'll
kill these two old people!

1767
02:05:17,523 --> 02:05:18,581
Papa.

1768
02:05:18,658 --> 02:05:21,252
Brother Kishan, do you recall
where the diamonds are?

1769
02:05:22,395 --> 02:05:23,726
l am waiting for them.

1770
02:05:24,263 --> 02:05:29,724
Whom are you waiting
for, l'm there.

1771
02:05:29,802 --> 02:05:36,264
Look here once, l'm here.

1772
02:05:36,342 --> 02:05:39,334
Hey Sardar, stop your rape!

1773
02:05:39,412 --> 02:05:43,348
Hey strong man, you are
trying to say 'rap'!

1774
02:05:43,416 --> 02:05:47,819
This is Gujarati! Your
voice is getting raped.

1775
02:05:47,954 --> 02:05:50,548
You do one thing. Change your voice.

1776
02:05:50,623 --> 02:05:53,490
Don't worry, l'll pay
for the operation.

1777
02:05:54,760 --> 02:05:56,955
Hey Sardar, have you
lost your mind?!

1778
02:05:57,029 --> 02:06:01,295
Not lost it! l have
realized the truth!

1779
02:06:01,367 --> 02:06:03,426
Although l realized
it a little late.

1780
02:06:03,502 --> 02:06:05,231
The truth is so evident that..

1781
02:06:05,304 --> 02:06:08,296
..there is no question
of any doubts.

1782
02:06:08,374 --> 02:06:11,241
The reputation that
had got tattered..

1783
02:06:11,310 --> 02:06:12,971
..has been rebuilt again.

1784
02:06:13,246 --> 02:06:15,237
ln short, the moral of
the story is that..

1785
02:06:15,314 --> 02:06:17,441
..l'm going to be the
owner of this hotel.

1786
02:06:17,516 --> 02:06:19,313
Hey, hey Sardar!

1787
02:06:19,585 --> 02:06:21,246
There is a question of
life and death here..

1788
02:06:21,320 --> 02:06:22,719
..do not interfere!

1789
02:06:22,922 --> 02:06:26,790
Come, move aside, otherwise
l'll shoot you first!

1790
02:06:26,859 --> 02:06:28,258
Hey Barbie doll!

1791
02:06:28,327 --> 02:06:31,592
Give me those hands, they would
be useful for massage.

1792
02:06:31,664 --> 02:06:32,858
Take her, take her away.

1793
02:06:32,932 --> 02:06:35,992
Hey l'll take you away
too, you blackie!

1794
02:06:36,269 --> 02:06:37,600
Hey Sardar, what are you doing?

1795
02:06:38,271 --> 02:06:40,671
Brother Kishan is trying
to recall something.

1796
02:06:40,740 --> 02:06:43,334
Why are you interfering and
disturbing his concentration?!

1797
02:06:43,409 --> 02:06:47,402
We are all stuck in this world.

1798
02:06:47,546 --> 02:06:50,344
But you do not worry, everyone
will be relieved.

1799
02:06:50,416 --> 02:06:53,544
Everyone's fate will change
for the better.

1800
02:06:53,619 --> 02:06:57,555
Hey Sardar! Get out of here
before your luck runs out!

1801
02:06:57,623 --> 02:07:01,889
My luck won't run out,
it will shine!

1802
02:07:01,961 --> 02:07:04,896
Look what do l have?!

1803
02:07:16,776 --> 02:07:17,970
Brother Kishan, diamonds!

1804
02:07:18,044 --> 02:07:19,306
Diamonds are found!

1805
02:07:19,578 --> 02:07:20,636
Hello.

1806
02:07:38,597 --> 02:07:40,724
No one will move beginning
from the Sardar!

1807
02:07:41,934 --> 02:07:43,401
Drop your guns!

1808
02:07:44,470 --> 02:07:46,404
Where?
- Don't confuse me!

1809
02:07:46,472 --> 02:07:48,736
What do you mean where?
Here in my hands!

1810
02:07:50,743 --> 02:07:53,405
C'mon everybody turn around.
- This way!

1811
02:07:54,747 --> 02:07:56,544
Now stretch your hands
for the handcuffs.

1812
02:08:02,755 --> 02:08:04,347
One handcuff, 12 hands!

1813

Be honest criminals! Stay

K.G - Yes. - You wait
for me near the gate.

1818
02:08:18,904 --> 02:08:20,895
And see to it that nobody
goes out from the gate.

02:08:21,374 --> 02:08:22,432
Okay.
- Follow me.

1820

Look, l don't hit women. Look..
