Why are y ou s o i nterested

H ow much do y ou k now

40
00:06:58,926 --> 00:06:59,861
He was .

41

He was taken to J .J . H osp ital

42
00:07:06,747 --> 00:07:10,456
He es caped after i nj uri ng
four security officers yesterday.

43
00:07:12,481 --> 00:07:15,325
The Mumbai po l ice want
the C BI's help .

44
00:07:16,304 --> 00:07:20,191
The prob lem is that it is
very d ifficu lt to fi nd any clue. . .

45
00:07:20,336 --> 00:07:22,279
. . .wh ich wou ld leads us
to Lajja S hanker.

46
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:25,401
F or he neither has
friends nor a gang .

47
00:07:27,253 --> 00:07:30,891
And s o, o n my recommendatio n,
the C BI has decided to . . .

48
00:07:31,042 --> 00:07:32,984
. . .send y ou to Mumbai .

49
00:07:34,482 --> 00:07:37,504
The truth is we do n't even
k now for sure whether. . .

50
00:07:37,645 --> 00:07:40,631
. . . Lajja S hanker is
sti l l i n Mumbai or not.

51
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:48,279
You wi l l have to take another
crim i nal's help . . .

52
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:51,406
. . .to fi nd about h is
whereabouts and mo ves .

53
00:07:52,903 --> 00:07:54,882
Th is is Profess or
Aman Verma's fi le.

54
00:07:56,031 --> 00:08:00,096
He is not a profess or b y profess io n,
i nfact he is a gangster.

55
00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:04,606
He is k nown as Profess or i n
the Mumbai u nderworld . . .

56
00:08:04,755 --> 00:08:06,343
. . .because of h is s harp brai n .

57
00:08:06,632 --> 00:08:08,777
He is i n the Matu nga jai l
of Mumbai at present.

58
00:08:09,934 --> 00:08:12,257
The asto n is h i ng fact is that

59
00:08:12,402 --> 00:08:15,389
. . . he has more i nformatio n

60
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:16,952
. . .than compared to us .

61
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:20,603
Al l the happen i ngs and the

On ly he can lead
us to Lajja S hanker.

66
00:08:38,366 --> 00:08:40,345
S ir, I th i nk y ou have
made a m istake.

67
00:08:40,485 --> 00:08:43,816
You s hou ld have sent an experienced

68
00:08:44,101 --> 00:08:47,988
Th is g irl has do ne noth i ng for her

69
00:08:48,132 --> 00:08:50,763
Mus htaq, I do n't lo ok at what

71
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:58,766
You never noticed the restless ness

72
00:08:59,568 --> 00:09:01,713
Th is g irl wants to
do s ometh i ng i n l ife.

S he can do anyth i ng to wipe
off the stigma o n her fam i ly.

74
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:09,536
Her past has broug ht such a
lot of d isgrace to her. . .

75
00:09:09,681 --> 00:09:11,624
. . .that it is necessary for
her to save herself from it.

76
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,747
Mus htaq, the peop le who k now

Do n't be afraid, my ch i ld .

125
00:12:24,147 --> 00:12:27,513
Profess or Aman Verma
hates po l icemen .

126
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:32,034
Because three years ago when Lajja
S hanker had spread terror i n Mumbai, . .

127
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:35,336
. . .the po l ice had go ne

128
00:12:35,617 --> 00:12:38,982
Profess or d id n't care for h is l ife

129
00:12:39,266 --> 00:12:42,453
But the po l ice, i nstead of

He m ig ht d is l ike y ou to o .

132
00:13:08,219 --> 00:13:12,627
Lig ht seems to
have deserted me.

133
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:17,845
There is dark ness everywhere.

134
00:13:29,594 --> 00:13:38,352
I wis h I fi nd s ome ray

Every happ i ness is

I hope I fi nd s ome ray

139
00:15:09,207 --> 00:15:14,138
Lig ht seems to

140
00:15:35,623 --> 00:15:45,413
There is an u n heard clamor
i n the s i lence of the n ig ht.

141
00:15:45,702 --> 00:15:54,732
Wh ich is the stri ng that is

142
00:15:55,017 --> 00:16:04,463
Lifeless bars have

I wis h I fi nd s ome ray

00:16:15,002 --> 00:16:19,754
Lig ht seems to

145
00:16:27,863 --> 00:16:32,970
What d ire s ituatio n made the

You have a lot of co nfidence i n

150
00:17:11,934 --> 00:17:14,434
The department trusts

You can help us .

00:17:20,971 --> 00:17:22,950
Wi l l y ou s how me y our face?

He never used to speak,

475
00:52:34,228 --> 00:52:37,215
It is useless for us,

Why are y ou troub l i ng me

Can't y ou see, I am speaki ng

They are m irrors .

Smal ls kids can peep i nto them

485
00:54:05,534 --> 00:54:07,514
These eyes are fu l l

Lo ok! Can they dream of

If y ou des ire, y ou can feel the

You are not as dumb

00:58:11,335 --> 00:58:13,658
But how can I trust a

It is the first time I have

O h God, I have

My lo ve for

537
01:02:22,524 --> 01:02:28,497
Then why does my heart
fear separatio n from y ou?

01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:35,097
I can g ive my l ife for y ou .

S ir, y ou? !

547
01:04:04,467 --> 01:04:06,446
Where, S ir?
To the H ome secretary's office.

548
01:04:06,586 --> 01:04:08,873
Why, S ir? Because of y ou,

What have y ou do ne?
I haven't do ne anyth i ng !

551
01:04:15,589 --> 01:04:17,568
We'l l k now about it

I wo nder what i nformatio n the
ACP has g iven h im agai nst y ou .

553
01:04:25,321 --> 01:04:28,686
S ir, I do n't mean to say that
the ACP has wro ng i nformatio n .

554
01:04:28,970 --> 01:04:30,771
Reeth must have said it.

555
01:04:31,055 --> 01:04:35,642
But it's noth i ng new to bribe
o ne crim i nal to get another caug ht.

556
01:04:36,269 --> 01:04:39,113
We have always been do i ng it.
Yes, we have been !

557
01:04:39,397 --> 01:04:41,198
But with i n our l im its .

558
01:04:42,177 --> 01:04:45,021
Before taki ng any such step we
seek the perm iss io n of our sen iors . . .

559
01:04:45,167 --> 01:04:46,589
. . .or the H ome M i n ister.

560
01:04:46,730 --> 01:04:49,645
We do n't m isuse the H ome M i n ister's
name and do as we l ike!

561
01:04:49,928 --> 01:04:51,907
What does that g irl

562
01:04:52,049 --> 01:04:54,679
S ir, do y ou real ise that if

564
01:04:58,652 --> 01:05:00,595
. . . it wi l l be d ifficu lt for

565
01:05:01,051 --> 01:05:04,073
The very newspapers wh ich

You have g iven that g irl
u n necessary freedom .

568
01:05:11,478 --> 01:05:14,500
The go vernment has a way of
worki ng, it has an image.

569
01:05:14,641 --> 01:05:16,927
That g irl s hou ld have spoken to

01:05:18,464 --> 01:05:19,707
The po l ice wou ld have come to us, . . .

574
01:05:25,033 --> 01:05:29,264
S ir, I th i nk there is a lot of
d ifference i n our Modus Operend i .

575
01:05:29,551 --> 01:05:32,917
That is why the H ome M i n istry has
decided to take th is case back.

576
01:05:36,329 --> 01:05:38,130
I have spoken to the M i n ister.

577
01:05:38,761 --> 01:05:42,304
The po l ice wi l l hand le th is case

You are comm itti ng a

579
01:05:45,018 --> 01:05:47,518
He is more worried about h is
false pride than a kid's l ife!

580
01:05:47,659 --> 01:05:49,602
Ms . Reeth, s it outs ide u nti l

S ir, he wi l l o n ly speak

Reeth, th is case is

They s hou ld be s orry, not me.

595

They, who do n't accept the truth

01:06:46,329 --> 01:06:49,481
And y ou are supporti ng them !
I am o n y our s ide, not their's !

597
01:06:52,898 --> 01:06:56,535
S ir, my grandma had to ld me

' But do n't be s cared, ch i ld'!

601

' Do n't get s cared and

602
01:07:14,204 --> 01:07:16,527
' But go ahead with

603
01:07:17,854 --> 01:07:22,263
' Remember, however much

605
01:07:28,976 --> 01:07:30,599
I have decided, S ir.

606
01:07:32,104 --> 01:07:34,083
I wi l l save that ch i ld .

607
01:07:35,232 --> 01:07:37,555
With support or without.

Do n't cry, ch i ld . Is y our
