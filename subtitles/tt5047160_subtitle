00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,010
Watch… watch this side …

2
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,010
the leg…hey, the leg!

3
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:01,430
the leg…hey, the leg!

4
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,310
Watch the leg...

5
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,810
Take him
Not so far …not…

6
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,260
Vishnu!

7
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,390
I’m sweaty!

8
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,470
That’s okay! That’s you!

9
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,810
Wait… wait …

10
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:18,140
show me your biceps …

11
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,600
Flex it?
- Yeah.

12
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,430
Okay?

13
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:26,890
- Yup.

14
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,220
Awesome!

15
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,140
So?

16
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,220
What’s up?

17
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,970
You tell me - what’s up with you?

18
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,810
Yeah … chugging on …

19
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,510
You were terrific!

20
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,390
Hey no, I fouled … we lost.

21
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,470
That’s alright.

22
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,350
So you think I should come over there?

23
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:12,470
Yes, what else? Saves me from
running over here to see you.

24
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,140
Dad says, join Uncle’s
paper as a trainee…

25
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:23,140
Where? Bhaktavalsalan’s paper?
Land of Bharat? - Yes.

26
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:26,510
Better than hanging around here
playing kabbadi and Hindutva!

27
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,310
Come along, you can pile on me…

28
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,640
Hey, what’s your plan these days?
You’re out of college, right?

29
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,930
Have to organize a solo exhibition…
got to get some things done for that …

30
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,310
Okay, so we go there, right?

31
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,890
Let me change …
- Yeah

32
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,760
What’s all this?

33
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,060
What?

34
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,470
All this is going to be in your solo show?

35
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:15,930
Ha, just you wait, buddy! You’ll see –
it’s all packed –in the other room!

36
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:17,470
Take a look!

37
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,890
Okay, great!

38
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,010
What’s it?

39
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:55,180
Lord Anjaneya, I beg you,
watch over my Vishnu!

40
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,970
Hey, cut it!

41
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,310
Yeah? What's up?

42
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:28,890
Vishnu!
- Um?

43
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,760
Can you hold that last pose again?

44
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,430
Face down?
- Yeah, face down … rising up.

45
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,140
This one?
- Right.

46
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,720
Hold, hold! Don’t move!
- Um.

47
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,220
Okay.

48
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:06,640
Show that muscle again …
like this … nicely flexed …

49
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:08,930
Like this?

50
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,640
Tighter!

51
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:25,470
Left leg over here …

52
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,430
Hand on top …

53
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:33,140
Here?
- Yeah …

54
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,850
Put your hand on top …

55
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:39,680
Behind your head … like this …

56
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,140
This way?
- Um...

57
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,220
Face …

58
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,140
Tighter …!

59
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:04,310
Ahah! Awesome!

60
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:13,810
Now … here … this posture, here …
the Egyptian Ka …

61
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,010
Like this

62
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:18,010
The Egyptian Ka, see, here,
the hand … like this …

63
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:18,970
This is right?

64
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:22,260
Yes, that’s fine.

65
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:25,810
What about this? Okay?

66
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,310
No … yes …

67
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,970
alright now.

68
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,430
Turn around

69
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,220
Where to?
- Back, back

70
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,510
Stop shifting!

71
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:52,890
Correct now?

72
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:54,970
Yup! Don’t move.

73
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,510
No moving, remember?
- Um.

74
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,010
Done?
- Wait … wait…

75
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:06,140
What’s this, a temple?
And who’s this Hanuman?

76
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,310
This is my Vishnu

77
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:13,260
Which? Oh, our Vishnu?
When did he land up?

78
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:14,930
Yesterday
- Eh?

79
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:31,930
Didn’t bring goodies from
back home, you twerp?

80
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,010
Oh yeah … I go home to bring sackfuls!

81
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:41,430
Bro, everyone’s coming
this evening …

82
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:46,140

83
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,260
Yeah

84
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,140
Oh, I am late, got to run

85
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:52,760
You’re leaving?
Okay, then do me a favour …

86
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:54,390
...give him a ride to Land of Bharat

87
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:59,890
Who, this guy? In my scooty?
No way! I’m already late!

88
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:03,890
You’re in for it anyway!
You drop him!

89
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:05,060
Alright, come on?

90
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,930

Painter? What painter?
Why’re you staying with him?

105

Hmm … no need.
You stay with Rajesh…

107

I run this paper to preserve
our culture, is that clear?

00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:23,140
Very interesting name too.

131

Good stuff! But change the font of

142
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:59,810
Make Lord Hanuman's logo brighter…

...and why is Divakarji’s face
so dark in the poster?

144

145
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,260
Uh, his face needs to be light-skinned

146

okay

147
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:21,220

your friend is trouble…

148
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,970
He’s alright, Uncle …
he’s a good friend

149
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,140
We don’t need such friends, okay?

150

move out and make it fast

he’s drawing me …

have to do with that guy, uh?

153
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:41,220

I’ll pay you next week, Hamsikka

158
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:08,810
Uh-um, this won’t do!

159
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:12,810
This will do – what’s the problem?

160
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:20,970
Midnight booze parties …

No, this won’t do!

163
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:31,060
Hamsikka, I tell you, next week, for sure

164
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:35,060
Ha, you’ve been singing the
same tune for a long time!

165
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:39,970

166
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,890
will pay you for sure this week …

Goodness, Hamsikka, chill! Everything’ll
be alright! Next week for sure, ok?

169
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:55,850
No smiling and gushing before me!

170
00:28:56,060 --> 00:29:00,760
Don’t hang back if you
can’t pay up each month

171
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:05,350
See these pictures?
They’ll be sold in my show next week

172
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,470
These!
- I sell them, and you get your rent!

173
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:13,470
Hmm! Who’s going to buy pictures
of men without a stitch on them?

174
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:18,100
No, no, this won’t work …
hey Haris, try something else

175
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:24,310
Yeah, rows of hunks,
walking in all the time

00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:42,970
What’s up? Oldster’s freaking out?

179
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:49,140
He’s nuts. Forget him.
How’s work at your Uncle’s?

180
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,640
Um.

181
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:54,930
Um?

182
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,140
Uncle’s all daggers

183
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,970
What happened?
- You’re famous there

184
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:00,970
Uh?

185
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:04,260
He says I should move out, right now.

186
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:12,640
Oh yeah! As if I need his
certificate to stay alive!

187
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,640
He can hug Hindutva India …
and fix his ass right there …

188
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:18,970
he’d better not try to bug me

189
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:22,470
No bro , it’s serious.

190
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:27,220
Trouble if folks back home
get the news … I should move

191
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:30,310
You’re leaving me?

192
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:33,640
No, buddy, this …

193
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:37,810
You think you can really leave me?

194
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:42,260
Uh?

195
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:45,680
Really, can you?

196
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:55,310
Can you?

197
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:25,640
Hey!

198
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,060
Hi Haris

199
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:31,970

Hey Bud!

200

Good thrashing guaranteed …!

207
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,640
Why should I?

208
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,970
Hey, there’s still space
for all this here even now

209
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:02,850
Really? Where? This is where Perumal
Murugan had to give up writing!

210
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:07,100
Are all these people mad?
Can’t they just let live and love?

211
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:12,260
I’m not into loving-shoving …
I want to draw … show what I draw!

212
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:16,100
No one’s dying over your love and
fuck… you just keep drawing.

213
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,810
Surprise! Haris’ solo show

214
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:24,970
Wow! That’s great man!

215
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,510
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you

216

Everything’s fixed …
I’ve spoken with Mr Swaminathan!

217

We must have a blast! Let’s!

218
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:36,890
Wow, bro! Amazing! Amazing man!

219
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,640
What is in there to scan this much?

220
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:49,060
Hey Hanuman! Here!
Taste a bit! Come!

221
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:52,600
Hey, hey, leave him … just leave …

222
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:54,060
What, buddy, call him!

223
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:58,720
Just let him be! You sit down there!
What a bother, this!

224
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:19,890
Look at her wash – half-naked!
And look when she’s back – after dark!

225
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:24,260
No men here to tame her insolence!

226
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:36,310
Stop, stop!

227
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,890
Mother!

228
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:50,600
Go inside, wench!

229
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:52,220
Any tea left?

230
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:51,850
You girl, didn’t I say, go inside? Uh?
Look at her skimpy top!

231
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:58,560
Yeah, then she’ll wear a purdah
and play from tomorrow!

232
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:19,010
Dilshakkutty, where’re you’ve been?
Where’s your mum? Eh?

233
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:23,930
She’s pulling a face … fought
with grandmom

234
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:29,390
You’re mum has nothing else in life?
Pulling a face all the time!

235
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:01,100
What is climb means?

236
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,310
I want to climb the tree.

237
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:09,470
What is brother means?

238
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,760
I’ll take that, mum …
you take your medicine and rest a bit

239
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:29,430
It isn’t so bad now

he can’t come home with no job

Did they fight?

245
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:48,140
Ah, he told her something …
she’s sad …

246
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:57,560
how my children suffer … when their
father’s still alive! Ah, Allah sees all.

came to be? by J Devika [Book title]

Straight!

251
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:32,600
Hold this

Give it here, you …

259

I am not your model, and
you aren’t drawing me …

260
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:00,970
I’ll move out to Uncle’s right now

Sir, you called?

263
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:52,720
What’s this?
Bloody pads in the toilet?

264
00:50:52,810 --> 00:50:54,640
What’s this place?
The Government Hospital?

265
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:57,810
What the hell have you been hired for?

266
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:00,260
Must be some girl here, Sir!

267
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,470
This isn’t the first time, Sir.

268
00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:06,140
I’ll find out, Sir

269
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:11,510
And not just that, Sir, the toilet
seat is unbearable … all bloody

270
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,010
Huh, what supervisor are you, woman?

271
00:51:14,430 --> 00:51:17,010
Why do I pay you?

272
00:51:17,850 --> 00:51:22,100
Look, we don't want any
unclean bitches here

273
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:23,760
I’ll handle it, sir

274
00:51:23,810 --> 00:51:27,930
Yeah, you’d better … or you’ll have
to take a long walk OUT .. that’s it!

275
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,760
Which of you threw the
bloodied pad in there?

So? Should women be stripped
for cleanliness’sake?

314
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:14,640
Women did the stripping,
didn’t they? Not the men?

01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:49,350
I’ll call Saidali and tell him …
let him decide …

351
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:55,510
girls need some modesty! Let me
see if I can make you stand still!

352
01:01:55,930 --> 01:01:56,810
Oh yeah, indeed!

353
01:01:56,890 --> 01:02:01,310
I’m going to be improved by your
son who’s running around marrying …!

354
01:02:01,390 --> 01:02:02,970
Look how she argues with me!

355
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:12,220
What’s wrong with you, my child!

356
01:02:12,810 --> 01:02:13,890
Nothing, Ma

357
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:21,060
Your coming late and getting into strikes
and all that is becoming trouble …

358
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:26,470
Ashraf’s been telling Saira …
his friend told him something …

359
01:02:27,350 --> 01:02:31,100
you be careful …
She’ll lose her life too, child

360
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:40,810
Why are we all so silent?

361
01:03:41,850 --> 01:03:44,430
Can we let this pass?
Shouldn’t we do something?

362
01:03:45,470 --> 01:03:49,220
It will be dumb to expect
the police to do anything …

363
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:56,510
We made it news, didn’t we?
No one’s taken it up?

364
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:01,310
Let’s try FB …
the police won’t lift a finger

365
01:04:03,810 --> 01:04:10,010
We aren’t just bodies and that
should be proven with our bodies!

366
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:13,930
We need a unique protest …
it is a matter of our self respect!

367
01:04:14,010 --> 01:04:15,560
No, we don’t need a protest

368
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:16,810
Then what the fuck do we need?

369
01:04:16,930 --> 01:04:18,810
You can say that,
but we are playing with her life

370
01:04:18,930 --> 01:04:21,140
This isn’t just her life, it involves us all

371
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:22,810
Hey Haris, don’t make
a fuss unnecessarily …

372
01:04:22,930 --> 01:04:24,350
You are in a soup anyway.

373
01:04:24,510 --> 01:04:26,010
You jump into things and that’s
why you are down in the dumps!

374
01:04:26,140 --> 01:04:28,350
Life isn’t your fucking painting, I say!

375
01:04:28,430 --> 01:04:29,470
Get lost you duffer …

376
01:04:29,810 --> 01:04:32,140
I am doing better than getting
bloom lotus in Bhaktavalsalan’s ass

377
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:33,010
Hey!

378
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:35,010
Move aside you two!

379
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:38,310
As if all we need is the two of
you grabbing each other’s throats!

380
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:43,220
This is my problem, and I will deal
with it. Haris, I need your help

381
01:04:43,310 --> 01:04:46,220
Uh ho, OKAY! So that’s that – I quit!

382
01:05:04,890 --> 01:05:15,180
My body is my right …
Menstrual blood is not impure …

383
01:05:38,310 --> 01:05:45,310
My body is my right …

384
01:05:45,470 --> 01:05:48,600
My blood, your birth …

385
01:05:48,810 --> 01:05:52,010
Menstrual blood is not impure …

386
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:55,640
My blood, your birth …

387
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:09,560
Please stop this!

388
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:12,640
What is it, sir?
- Madam, you must consent to arrest

389
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:15,310
Why? - We expect law
and order problems here

390
01:06:15,470 --> 01:06:17,390
On what grounds are you arresting us?

391
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:20,680
Not to bother you, Madam …
but the police must protect you.

392
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:22,510
Don’t you see, over there … gathered?

393
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:25,310
Sir, that’s not our problem, that’s yours

394
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:28,140
It’s not the problem …
do you have permission for this?

395
01:06:28,220 --> 01:06:30,310
Yes, we have secured permission
- show me the permission

396
01:06:30,390 --> 01:06:31,260
yea

397
01:06:37,140 --> 01:06:38,510
Legally it’s okay,

398
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:41,180
but if there’s a law and order problem,
the police will have to intervene

399
01:06:41,260 --> 01:06:43,180
So please let us arrest you

400
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:44,310
No, impossible

401
01:06:44,350 --> 01:06:49,850
police go back

402
01:06:49,970 --> 01:06:55,720
down down policing

403
01:06:55,810 --> 01:06:59,220
My body is my right!

404
01:07:00,140 --> 01:07:02,010
police go back

405
01:07:03,430 --> 01:07:06,180
Down, down, police!

406
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:10,260
police go back

407
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:17,470
police go back

408
01:07:33,890 --> 01:07:40,350
Police go to hell!

409
01:08:03,260 --> 01:08:07,970
Where were you till now you bitch?

410
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:10,760
Where were you …
Today I’ll see that you…

411
01:08:10,810 --> 01:08:11,430
No, no

412
01:08:11,510 --> 01:08:14,310
Beat her to death, the insolent female!

413
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:16,260
Please go inside!

414
01:08:16,350 --> 01:08:17,600
No!

415
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:23,470
Where did you go,
dragging the family to shame?

416
01:08:23,970 --> 01:08:27,930
I won’t let you live … I’ll murder you …

417
01:08:28,010 --> 01:08:29,430
No, brother

418
01:08:29,470 --> 01:08:31,430
Go, go

419
01:08:32,430 --> 01:08:34,140
You get up and go inside my child

420
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:37,140
Women are the family’s honour

421
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:40,350
What, what,
what did you think about me?

422
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:43,600
What did you think of this Saidali?

423
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:49,560
Uh, silent? Speak up!
Today I’m going to … you

424
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:51,060
Stop!

425
01:08:51,220 --> 01:08:52,510
She is a girl. Leave her alone.

426
01:08:52,850 --> 01:08:54,390
Just shut up.

427
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:58,430
This is the matter of our family’s honour!

428
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:05,640
Don’t try to scare me with that
stare… I’ll kick you to…

429
01:09:06,930 --> 01:09:08,810
Hey, child!

430
01:09:08,930 --> 01:09:12,640
What are you doing, girl?

431
01:09:12,850 --> 01:09:16,470
Don’t mess with me, I won’t even
think that you are my father!

432
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:20,470
Enough, let go … people will notice

433
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:24,100
Let them! Sons of a bitch!

434
01:09:24,350 --> 01:09:25,760
Let go, child

435
01:09:26,810 --> 01:09:28,470
My God!

436
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:31,140
Auntie Sia!

437
01:10:34,810 --> 01:10:36,430
Come here!

438
01:10:37,220 --> 01:10:40,810
Auntie Sia, don’t go!

439
01:11:49,850 --> 01:11:53,310
Sia, what’s happened?

440
01:11:55,430 --> 01:11:57,350
Get up

441
01:13:16,890 --> 01:13:18,390
Who all of you stay here?

442
01:13:18,510 --> 01:13:19,810
Me and my friends

443
01:13:19,890 --> 01:13:22,100
Okay, I want to take a look
at hour friends.. come

444
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:29,680
Let us look, sonny … Rajetta,
you too take a look at the guests!

445
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:33,010
This business won’t do …
get out, get out

446
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:35,510
What’s the problem, Hamsikka

447
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:36,930
Ah, there are problems, sonny boy …

448
01:13:37,010 --> 01:13:40,680
let me see, ah, she’s right here,
come out here

449
01:13:40,810 --> 01:13:42,140
Come here...

450
01:13:42,260 --> 01:13:43,680
Yeah, yeah, come out my dear,
come out, darling

451
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:46,060
Get out, scram!

452
01:13:46,180 --> 01:13:47,180
Who are you, girl?

453
01:13:47,350 --> 01:13:48,260
Who is the hell are you to ask?

454
01:13:48,310 --> 01:13:51,970
Uhh? This is Rajan, the Secretary
of the Residents’ Association!

455
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:55,680
So I need to know about it, see?
Who are these to you?

456
01:13:56,060 --> 01:13:56,970
My friends

457
01:13:57,060 --> 01:13:59,220
Well, all friends, get out! SCRAM!

458
01:13:59,260 --> 01:14:00,140
Hamsikka, what’s the issue?

459
01:14:00,220 --> 01:14:04,010
Too many issues. Sonny …
we can’t let it go on … now get out

460
01:14:04,180 --> 01:14:06,850
This is a place for decent folk!

461
01:14:07,010 --> 01:14:09,100
Don’t touch me!

462
01:14:09,180 --> 01:14:10,430
Go, go, go on!
Don’t touch me please!

463
01:14:11,350 --> 01:14:12,810
Their all faggots!

464
01:14:13,470 --> 01:14:14,140
My painting!

465
01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:17,600
That’s his old man’s picture!
Take it and get lost!

466
01:14:18,140 --> 01:14:19,970
No good … let them go, go

467
01:14:20,010 --> 01:14:21,310
Look at his fucking nonsense drawing?

468
01:14:21,470 --> 01:14:23,100
This won’t work here!

469
01:17:27,470 --> 01:17:30,310
Uncle

470
01:18:57,390 --> 01:18:59,600
Why are you in this
fisherman's colony, Vishnu?

471
01:19:00,470 --> 01:19:02,720
Your father called. He wants
to know his son’s plans

472
01:19:03,470 --> 01:19:06,810
Haris’ paintings are going to
be shown … I’m helping him

473
01:19:06,890 --> 01:19:09,140
Show those pictures of naked …?

474
01:19:12,310 --> 01:19:13,510
Where is it?

475
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:14,810
downtown gallery

476
01:19:17,140 --> 01:19:22,560
Well, you should NOT be
seen there, understand? Come!

477
01:28:13,140 --> 01:28:16,510
Dr. Titus Thomas
Aversion Therapist & Sexologist [sign]

478
01:28:27,510 --> 01:28:28,470
Come
