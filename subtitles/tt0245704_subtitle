1
00:01:38,095 --> 00:01:40,056
Those who believe Lord Rama
will never get disappointed.

2
00:01:40,481 --> 00:01:43,817
Our Seetharam will definitely
get justice.

3
00:01:44,117 --> 00:01:47,007
How can he get justice? It seems
he'll be hanged tomorrow.

4
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:49,607
When asked about his last wish
before getting hanged...

5
00:01:50,408 --> 00:01:53,710
It seems he made a wish to visit
our village's Lord Rama's temple.

6
00:01:54,305 --> 00:01:57,838
It's unbelievable that such a
good man killing an S.I.

7
00:02:08,342 --> 00:02:10,007
Seetharam is coming...

8
00:02:10,983 --> 00:02:15,205
Seetharam is coming...

9
00:02:18,768 --> 00:02:19,749
It seems Seetharam is coming...

10
00:02:22,662 --> 00:02:23,486
Come quickly!

11
00:02:28,165 --> 00:02:32,978
Hey! Move away... move away,
move away!

12
00:03:33,856 --> 00:03:36,165
What's this? What's all
this ill fate?

13
00:03:36,565 --> 00:03:37,380
Why is this injustice being
done to you?

14
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,433
Hey! What's this?

15
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:46,865
Tata Rao! I've a simple request!

16
00:03:48,188 --> 00:03:51,214
We were celebrating Lord Rama's
birthday grandly every year.

17
00:03:52,114 --> 00:03:53,683
In future also it must be celebrated
in this same grand manner.

18
00:03:55,273 --> 00:03:57,101
Ensure that he's adequately
looked after.

19
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:58,061
Why?

20
00:03:58,933 --> 00:04:00,300
It is because he has taken
good care of you?

21
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:02,852
Is it for taking you
away from us?

22
00:04:03,571 --> 00:04:05,549
Or... is it for sentencing you
to gallows unjustly?

23
00:04:06,271 --> 00:04:08,331
Why should we take good care
of Lord Rama?

24
00:04:08,714 --> 00:04:10,990
What good has he done to us
to take good care of him?

25
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,003
Don't feel sad, Tata Rao!

26
00:04:12,964 --> 00:04:14,220
Whatever that Lord Rama does...
he'll do for our good only.

27
00:04:15,216 --> 00:04:15,614
Time's up!

28
00:04:18,888 --> 00:04:19,331
I'll go!

29
00:09:13,939 --> 00:09:16,459
Madam Vasundhara, please bring the bride
and make her sit here.

30
00:11:12,301 --> 00:11:15,177
You're a prisoner awaiting death sentence.
Do you want to marry?

31
00:11:15,728 --> 00:11:16,667
We'll perform your marriage.

32
00:11:18,153 --> 00:11:18,899
Hit him.

33
00:11:34,055 --> 00:11:36,093
Sir, Lawyer Sivaramakrishna has come.

34
00:11:49,582 --> 00:11:50,545
I want to talk to him personally.

35
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:30,943
Who are you?

36
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:33,365
Why do you want to kill me?

37
00:12:33,765 --> 00:12:34,504
To save your life!

38
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:37,078
If I hadn't shot at you.

39
00:12:38,138 --> 00:12:39,453
By this time, you would've
been hanged.

40
00:12:40,567 --> 00:12:43,914
Till this wound heals, your sentence
can't be executed.

41
00:12:44,405 --> 00:12:45,707
Why do you want to save my life?

42
00:12:46,116 --> 00:12:47,655
Though knowing very well that you're
awaiting death sentence.

43
00:12:48,571 --> 00:12:52,354
I want to know, why you forcibly
married a girl?

44
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:57,993
Tell me, did you love that girl?
Are you seeking revenge?

45
00:12:58,656 --> 00:12:59,315
Why did you marry her?

46
00:13:10,601 --> 00:13:11,970
Hey, Priest is asking coconuts.

47
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:13,873
- Go to our godown and get 100
coconuts from there! - Yes.

48
00:13:14,607 --> 00:13:17,294
Abbulu! It's getting late.
Prepare sweet beverage quickly.

49
00:13:17,594 --> 00:13:18,548
Sir, it's the last one.
It's almost ready.

50
00:13:18,848 --> 00:13:20,473
I'll beat you up!
Is this the last one?

51
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,138
People from all surrounding villages
are going to visit the Temple.

52
00:13:22,438 --> 00:13:23,551
This won't be enough! Prepare a
few more vessels full of beverage.

53
00:13:23,851 --> 00:13:24,198
Yes sir!

54
00:13:24,498 --> 00:13:26,890
- Prepare ten more vessels full of
soaked split black gram. - Yes.

55
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:28,342
Sir... please taste this.

56
00:13:33,202 --> 00:13:34,518
It's a pinch less sweeter.

57
00:13:35,201 --> 00:13:36,140
- So, add some jaggery to it. - Yes.

58
00:13:39,473 --> 00:13:39,830
Yes sir!

59
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:43,287
Sooramma's Padma, Rathnamma's Manga
are ogling at me.

60
00:13:43,878 --> 00:13:44,483
What's their intentions?

61
00:13:45,203 --> 00:13:48,401
My face is very glamour, isn't it?
It's the same problem I face everywhere.

62
00:13:48,814 --> 00:13:51,889
Women just fall head over heels on me
I'm unable to answer everyone.

63
00:13:52,479 --> 00:13:54,838
- Why are you staring at me?
- Yours is a glamourous face, isn't it?

64
00:13:55,138 --> 00:13:57,577
You've misunderstood!
I didn't say about my face.

65
00:13:57,877 --> 00:13:58,668
About your face, sir!

66
00:13:59,509 --> 00:14:01,540
If I bash you up! You'll end up
in a heap of trash.

67
00:14:02,304 --> 00:14:02,727
Carry on your work.

68
00:14:07,307 --> 00:14:08,753
Do you have any work with me?

69
00:14:10,494 --> 00:14:11,207
Nobody has seen it.

70
00:14:12,843 --> 00:14:13,551
- Brother!
- What is it?

71
00:14:14,233 --> 00:14:17,184
This is Lord's bridal dress. Father has
asked you to give it to the priest.

72
00:14:17,484 --> 00:14:17,923
Where is father?

73
00:14:18,343 --> 00:14:22,384
Every year, we're doing some good
social work on Lord's Birthday.

74
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,517
Last year, we built a Temple in the
Harijan Neighbourhood.

75
00:14:26,543 --> 00:14:28,199
A year before that,
we dug up few lakes.

76
00:14:28,999 --> 00:14:33,107
A year before that we laid new roads and
built a library in our village.

77
00:14:33,526 --> 00:14:37,363
Then, this year's total revenue
in Temple is Rs 4 lakhs.

78
00:14:37,897 --> 00:14:39,432
It'll be good if you people suggest
an idea for it's use.

79
00:14:39,932 --> 00:14:42,815
What can we make a suggestion
you're our village headman.

80
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:45,065
Whatever you do, you'll always
do for our good only.

81
00:14:45,365 --> 00:14:46,778
You only make the suggestion.

82
00:14:47,078 --> 00:14:51,225
We've got ourselves everything
for our village.

83
00:14:51,949 --> 00:14:53,272
I've run out of ideas.

84
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:57,436
Father, we'll do a thing which will make
our village all India famous.

85
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,098
What is it?

86
00:14:58,756 --> 00:15:00,099
There are 500 acres of
Temple's land, isn't it?

87
00:15:00,598 --> 00:15:03,772
If we give each farm worker
in our village an acre of land...

88
00:15:04,276 --> 00:15:05,697
There won't be any farm worker
left in our village.

89
00:15:05,997 --> 00:15:06,672
Everyone would become a farmer.

90
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:07,328
Excellent!

91
00:15:11,964 --> 00:15:13,972
Good! It's very good.

92
00:15:14,767 --> 00:15:19,483
If you want claps and felicitations for
your son, don't donate temples lands.

93
00:15:20,167 --> 00:15:21,887
Donate your own land holdings
and property.

94
00:15:22,438 --> 00:15:24,538
You shouldn't donate temple's land.

95
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:28,569
Who are you to question this? That land
was President's ancestors land.

96
00:15:29,005 --> 00:15:29,310
For that...

97
00:15:29,936 --> 00:15:33,209
For cheap publicity, will they
take back land donated to temple?

98
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,659
Who will take care of running
temple's administration?

99
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:37,497
Who will bear the expenses
of Lord Rama's marriage?

100
00:15:37,797 --> 00:15:41,759
Look, brother, this year Lord's lands
had fetched Rs 4 lakhs as income.

101
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:43,808
We'll deposit that amount in bank.

102
00:15:44,108 --> 00:15:46,164
Bank will pay us interest.

103
00:15:46,496 --> 00:15:49,881
With that interest we'll celebrate
Lord Rama's marriage every year grandly.

104
00:15:50,653 --> 00:15:51,819
Come on, you tell him man.

105
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:52,852
That's enough!

106
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:55,008
You'll celebrate marriage
with interest money.

107
00:15:55,778 --> 00:15:59,858
Who will white wash the temple, pay salary
to the priest, buy oil for lamps?

108
00:16:00,158 --> 00:16:01,149
Is it a problem?

109
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,523
If each house donates Rs 100
we'll have plenty of funds.

110
00:16:04,646 --> 00:16:07,201
What's this nasty, unsurping temple's
land and then donating.

111
00:16:07,612 --> 00:16:09,699
We won't allow even cent of
land of temple to be donated.

112
00:16:10,099 --> 00:16:11,283
How will it be if we
do like this?

113
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,474
Without applying scent of fragrance if we
donate lands how will it be?

114
00:16:16,526 --> 00:16:17,049
You'll pay up for it!

115
00:16:18,334 --> 00:16:18,712
That's it!

116
00:16:19,274 --> 00:16:21,187
This is not a place for Lord Rama
to battle with Demon Ravana.

117
00:16:21,663 --> 00:16:22,451
But Lord Rama and Seetha's marriage
should take place.

118
00:16:22,965 --> 00:16:25,005
If you want god's offerings
sit here patiently.

119
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,401
If you don't want that
inform us...

120
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:29,048
They'll bash you up!
You'll end up in a heap!

121
00:16:29,348 --> 00:16:31,734
Why to stay here getting insulted?
Come, let's go.

122
00:16:32,327 --> 00:16:33,381
You're an insult to the village.

123
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,050
Just to avoid seeing you I'm
wearing this foreign goggles.

124
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:39,025
Why are you bothering about them?

125
00:16:39,325 --> 00:16:41,682
Mr. President, do as you wish.

126
00:16:42,475 --> 00:16:44,554
Though, I'm a President of
this village for 30 years.

127
00:16:44,968 --> 00:16:49,084
I'm very proud that my son got an idea
which I couldn't in all these years.

128
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:55,329
As said by my son, I'm donating all
the temple's land to farm hands.

129
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:27,798
Brother!

130
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:29,869
What is it?

131
00:22:30,169 --> 00:22:30,544
What is happened?

132
00:22:31,993 --> 00:22:32,919
Brother, look there!

133
00:22:34,556 --> 00:22:36,173
Oh! God! You're losing so
much hair.

134
00:22:37,334 --> 00:22:42,647
He said if you use this oil, hairs will
grow thick and blacken with shine.

135
00:22:43,155 --> 00:22:46,151
Believing it's true, I used
it just only once.

136
00:22:46,709 --> 00:22:48,029
I've lost so much of my hair.

137
00:22:48,921 --> 00:22:53,782
Brother, I'm fearing that I'll lose all
my hair and become a skin head.

138
00:22:56,525 --> 00:22:58,324
Who's that guy, who sold
you this oil?

139
00:22:58,869 --> 00:22:59,923
Provision Stores Kitti!

140
00:23:04,218 --> 00:23:06,431
Were you the one, who sold this
oil bottle to my sister?

141
00:23:07,025 --> 00:23:07,350
It's me!

142
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:10,272
Did you tell her that her hair will
grow fast if she uses it?

143
00:23:11,093 --> 00:23:11,388
I told her!

144
00:23:12,264 --> 00:23:15,649
Will you sell spurious goods
to girls?

145
00:23:16,418 --> 00:23:18,886
Please, don't beat me! If you want
I'll compensate the loss.

146
00:23:19,405 --> 00:23:20,029
Then, give!

147
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:21,065
What do you want me to give?

148
00:23:21,446 --> 00:23:24,346
Eye for an eye...
tooth for a tooth...

149
00:23:25,342 --> 00:23:28,367
Blood for blood!
Hair for hair...

150
00:23:41,751 --> 00:23:44,024
You must be a skin head
all your life.

151
00:23:44,852 --> 00:23:46,421
If I see a hair grow
on this head...

152
00:23:47,315 --> 00:23:48,515
I'll break open your head.

153
00:23:50,283 --> 00:23:53,769
Love on your sister has
affected my head!

154
00:23:54,069 --> 00:23:55,432
- Mr. Kittiah!
- What?

155
00:23:55,832 --> 00:23:56,385
Do you have coconut oil?

156
00:23:57,056 --> 00:23:58,307
- Do you have a sister?
- I have.

157
00:23:58,757 --> 00:24:00,231
Then, I'm not selling coconut oil.

158
00:24:04,095 --> 00:24:04,504
Come madam.

159
00:24:06,492 --> 00:24:07,097
Get down... sir... get down.

160
00:24:09,187 --> 00:24:09,572
Get down...

161
00:24:10,338 --> 00:24:11,444
Excuse me! Get down...
we've reached your village.

162
00:24:13,445 --> 00:24:14,961
This is not the place where
we've to get down.

163
00:24:15,827 --> 00:24:17,305
Go straight to my uncle's house!

164
00:24:17,633 --> 00:24:18,394
This is a public transport bus!

165
00:24:18,672 --> 00:24:19,819
Not a corporation lorry to
stop ad every home.

166
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:20,917
This is the last stop.
Please, get down.

167
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:21,801
If we refuse to get down...

168
00:24:22,101 --> 00:24:23,019
We may be forced to make you
get down.

169
00:24:24,183 --> 00:24:27,008
Oh! God... oh! My god!

170
00:25:18,585 --> 00:25:20,304
Since when they've introduced
a bus to our house?

171
00:25:26,165 --> 00:25:28,278
What's this nastily, you've come
driving a bus?

172
00:25:28,721 --> 00:25:30,890
We didn't come by bus,
we drove the bus and come.

173
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:32,893
Why have you come in a bus?
What happened to your car?

174
00:25:33,193 --> 00:25:34,548
Uncle, car broke down
and stopped on way!

175
00:25:34,802 --> 00:25:36,162
- Then, where's sister?
- Here.

176
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:37,769
Not your sister! My sister.

177
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:40,341
Mother said she'll come after
getting the car repaired.

178
00:25:40,689 --> 00:25:42,035
We came happily in a bus.

179
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,245
Uncle, when an old man came on
to the middle of the road...

180
00:25:45,645 --> 00:25:47,627
Sister knocked him down
with the bus.

181
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,831
Don't know what happened to
the poor man? Lost limbs or dead?

182
00:25:51,131 --> 00:25:52,935
He broke his legs only, so only
you both are alive.

183
00:25:53,352 --> 00:25:55,162
Otherwise, I would've arranged
for your coffin.

184
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:57,408
Are you talking knowing
who they are?

185
00:25:57,856 --> 00:25:58,818
I don't care whoever they may be.

186
00:25:59,118 --> 00:26:00,845
Unknown cheap girls!

187
00:26:01,431 --> 00:26:03,208
They've unjustly broke that
old man's legs.

188
00:26:03,408 --> 00:26:04,301
They've to answer the
village committee.

189
00:26:04,701 --> 00:26:05,309
Come for village committee's enquiry.

190
00:26:05,609 --> 00:26:07,336
Village committee?!
What does it mean?

191
00:26:08,028 --> 00:26:08,999
Border of my dhoti!

192
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:12,491
Seetharam, are you daring take my nieces
to the village committee?

193
00:26:12,691 --> 00:26:14,550
Nieces or whoever it may be!

194
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:16,481
When anyone commits a mistake he must
come to the village committee.

195
00:26:16,973 --> 00:26:17,273
Come!

196
00:26:18,651 --> 00:26:20,059
I think you don't know
about we sisters.

197
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:21,434
Do you have anything extra!

198
00:26:21,834 --> 00:26:25,923
Hey no, they both are super brats
don't get into trouble with them.

199
00:26:26,223 --> 00:26:28,429
What will happen, if I do?
We'll kill them!

200
00:26:28,729 --> 00:26:30,948
What you'll kill? Ants!

201
00:26:31,397 --> 00:26:32,538
Don't act smart...
come with me.

202
00:26:32,838 --> 00:26:33,629
If we refuse to come?!

203
00:26:34,446 --> 00:26:35,660
I'll take you there by holding
your necks!

204
00:26:36,024 --> 00:26:37,215
Come, do it, let me see it!

205
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:43,704
If you put a step further
I'll break open your head.

206
00:26:44,254 --> 00:26:44,561
Come!

207
00:26:45,011 --> 00:26:48,331
When he's beating me and going away?
Why are you all watching fun?

208
00:26:49,459 --> 00:26:51,589
Let him go, sir! His sins
will punish him.

209
00:26:51,889 --> 00:26:52,593
Shut up, silly idiot.

210
00:26:52,893 --> 00:26:54,329
Don't know what he'll do
with them, taking there?!

211
00:26:54,729 --> 00:26:55,652
Come, let's go and bring my sister.

212
00:27:03,463 --> 00:27:06,353
If you move you'll lose your legs,
stand there.

213
00:27:09,105 --> 00:27:12,048
Who's that? Who's that man who
brought my daughters here?

214
00:27:12,348 --> 00:27:13,106
It's me!

215
00:27:14,457 --> 00:27:15,463
How proud you are?

216
00:27:16,394 --> 00:27:17,745
Will you talk disrespectfully
to me?

217
00:27:18,283 --> 00:27:20,207
Why should I respect you?

218
00:27:20,864 --> 00:27:21,444
Are you addressing me cheaply?

219
00:27:22,124 --> 00:27:24,878
When you can address me cheaply
can't I address you?

220
00:27:26,175 --> 00:27:27,814
Whatever it may be
cry it in Telugu!

221
00:27:28,114 --> 00:27:29,575
Everyone here will understand
your cries!

222
00:27:29,775 --> 00:27:31,293
Do you know with whom
you're talking?

223
00:27:31,593 --> 00:27:32,010
I know...

224
00:27:32,424 --> 00:27:34,483
You're the mother brat of
these super brats!

225
00:27:34,783 --> 00:27:35,682
What did you say?

226
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,111
Stop!

227
00:27:41,069 --> 00:27:44,195
Don't raise your hands
in emotion!

228
00:27:44,892 --> 00:27:46,635
Our Big Boss has great
mass following.

229
00:27:47,197 --> 00:27:48,533
He'll show his magic of hands!

230
00:27:50,347 --> 00:27:51,229
Look, Mrs. Vasudhara!

231
00:27:51,905 --> 00:27:54,498
You're also committing a crime by
supporting your daughter's crime.

232
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:56,840
If they've done a crime, report it to
the police or go to the court!

233
00:27:57,199 --> 00:27:58,824
This is the court or police station
for this village.

234
00:27:59,298 --> 00:28:00,750
Anyone committing a crime must
get punished here only!

235
00:28:01,297 --> 00:28:02,303
Father, you deliver the judgement.

236
00:28:02,603 --> 00:28:06,341
Look, what you've done for fun
a man has become handicapped.

237
00:28:06,541 --> 00:28:09,020
What do you want us to do? Do you
want us to repent and do sit ups?

238
00:28:10,107 --> 00:28:12,313
We'll ask you both to jump into a drain
canal along with your mother.

239
00:28:12,713 --> 00:28:15,167
You keep shut and hear him sir...
you carry on... go on...

240
00:28:15,467 --> 00:28:19,637
One whose leg you broke, 4 people
are dependents on him.

241
00:28:20,264 --> 00:28:21,782
Since he has become a
handicapped now.

242
00:28:22,168 --> 00:28:24,316
Their family has lost a
bread winner.

243
00:28:24,778 --> 00:28:28,711
So, as a recompensation, pay him
Rs 50.000 cash or...

244
00:28:29,068 --> 00:28:30,070
Give him an acre of land.

245
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:30,861
If we refuse to do it...

246
00:28:31,261 --> 00:28:33,708
You may have to buy wheel chairs
for your daughters.

247
00:28:34,088 --> 00:28:36,226
That means will you break
their legs nastily?

248
00:28:36,556 --> 00:28:38,208
We'll break their hands
also nastily!

249
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,848
Why do you want to get
into trouble with them?

250
00:28:40,148 --> 00:28:41,066
Throw Rs 50.000 on their face.

251
00:28:47,342 --> 00:28:49,848
I told you to pay the money,
not to throw at me.

252
00:28:50,212 --> 00:28:52,435
Pick the money and give it respectfully
to the old man's wife.

253
00:28:57,829 --> 00:28:59,581
Excellent! Not, it looks good.

254
00:28:59,901 --> 00:29:01,349
- Come, let's go!
- Go.
- Go!

255
00:29:02,877 --> 00:29:05,212
What is his status compared
to your status?

256
00:29:05,512 --> 00:29:07,107
He's not equal to a Grey hair
on your head.

257
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:09,869
Will he dare to insult you
in a crowd?

258
00:29:10,193 --> 00:29:11,556
How did he get that courage?

259
00:29:11,888 --> 00:29:14,157
Because he's popular with
the masses!

260
00:29:14,457 --> 00:29:15,597
And his father is village
committee's president.

261
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,280
What great president's post?

262
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:21,330
If sister shifts from city to here.

263
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,360
She can make him to resign
as president in 3 days.

264
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:28,360
If we just show her face, people will
just cast their votes to her.

265
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,450
Shut up! Their you didn't dare
to open your mouths.

266
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:32,360
Here you're boasting that you'll
make as this village president.

267
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,460
I thought they'll do something and
kept quiet otherwise...

268
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,320
You're too much sir!

269
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,430
I thought she'll wink at me so that
I can go and bash him up.

270
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,420
She didn't wink at me
I didn't go and beat him.

271
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:44,470
Still the situation hasn't
worsened sister

272
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,510
You just say yes, I'll
blow him out.

273
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:48,450
Madam, please say yes!

274
00:33:20,006 --> 00:33:22,947
What's this man? You said while going
you'll blow him but falling like this.

275
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:27,350
Our people's blow was little feeble
and his blows was little stronger.

276
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,440
Sister... I had to get myself
blown up by him.

277
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:34,430
He'll blow... he'll definitely blow,
that's why I didn't join you.

278
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:36,370
Aren't you all men?

279
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:37,380
We are men!

280
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:40,480
But he turned out to
be a real man.

281
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,320
There came the difference.

282
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,380
Aren't you ashamed to
say that, idiot?

283
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:45,490
Why should he feel ashamed?

284
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,430
Though alone that Seetharam bashed up
10 of our people.

285
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:51,390
That Seetharam must feel ashamed.

286
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:55,390
If you shake him up in the first
scene itself.

287
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,520
Hero may not be there
till climax so...

288
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,410
Your brother may have
hesitated a little.

289
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,440
Isn't it?

290
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:02,320
Yuck! Shut up, you fool!

291
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:05,300
Sister! Say yes, once more!

292
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:07,470
This time I'll get few
rowdies from city.

293
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,340
I'll blow him up before
the interval itself.

294
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:12,320
I'm not going to say
yes this time, shut up.

295
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:15,350
In 2 days, groom's people
are coming to see Pappi.

296
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,330
Let me finish that first
then, we'll take care of him.

297
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,500
Whatever it may be it must be
seen today itself.

298
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,310
What are you going to
see madam?

299
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,330
His ruination.

300
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:26,320
The people before whom he
had embarrassed us.

301
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:28,520
We'll embarrass him before
the same people.

302
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,430
That means you're going to
do comedy, nastily!

303
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,340
No, we'll make his life into
a tragedy.

304
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:36,330
Come, Bobby.

305
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:40,490
God! You must only save
these brat sisters.

306
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:43,480
I'll definitely save you
what's your problem?

307
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:47,310
I'm facing a huge problem
as soon as night falls.

308
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:49,310
My husband is coming home
without getting drunk.

309
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:52,410
It's problem if he comes
home drunk.

310
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:54,370
What's the problem if he comes
home without getting drunk?

311
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:57,420
If he comes drunk, he used
to sleep like a log.

312
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,310
I used to go out peacefully
for nature's calls.

313
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:02,510
So that's your problem.

314
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:05,440
Oh! You're great! You're
finding out everything.

315
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,490
Except children.

316
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:08,450
Sir, you're teasing me!

317
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:12,340
Look! Give me some amulet so that my
husband comes home drunk again.

318
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,400
I'll pay for your help.

319
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:19,410
I'm supporting the prohibition.

320
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,310
So, I can't give you any amulet.

321
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,360
Then, what's the way out for me?

322
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,320
River Godavari!

323
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:29,300
Are you sage Gilphonse?

324
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:34,320
A proud man has insulted us.

325
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,370
You must teach him a lesson.

326
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:37,310
In which type you want to teach him?

327
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:41,310
Like Devadas went after Parvathi,
like Majnu went after Laila.

328
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:45,330
He must go mad for we sisters and
come after us all his life.

329
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:55,320
Pay me Rs 5.000!
I'll give you an amulet.

330
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:59,340
Not Rs 5.000, I'll pay you Rs 10.000
give me powerful amulets.

331
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:11,350
Take. Tie this to his loin string.

332
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:14,510
He'll be after you mad holding this
in his hand for your love.

333
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,310
And to marry you with an
auspicious thread.

334
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:11,490
Get up... get up... get up...
my king.

335
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,390
Won't you get up? Do you want
me to wake you up?

336
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,370
You? Why are you here?

337
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,380
Where's Seetharam?

338
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:23,510
Look! I'm here!

339
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:26,360
Till now, you were here only, isn't it?
How did you go there?

340
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,410
I expected you'll do something
silly like this.

341
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:31,480
As soon as you went into dreams
I made Tata Rao to sleep here.

342
00:42:31,936 --> 00:42:32,790
And went aside.

343
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:35,500
Tata Rao! Pounce on them.

344
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:38,500
Will you tie me amulet, my dear?

345
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:41,310
I'll have you my dear...

346
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,520
Amulet has started functioning.

347
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:44,510
If he gets us, we're finished.

348
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:55,320
Mother, what's this saree so cheaply?

349
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:57,320
What's there cheap in
wearing a saree?

350
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,390
It's cheap only if you
don't wear a saree.

351
00:42:58,460 --> 00:42:59,380
Shut up!

352
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:04,370
Look dear! For marriage and bride seeing
ceremony one must drape only sarees.

353
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:08,420
You must show sister in a Midi or
Swimsuit to the coming American boy.

354
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,390
If you show her in a saree
how can he like her?

355
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:14,300
Not only just the groom, but accompanying
elders should also like her, isn't it?

356
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:15,450
What's this Pappi?

357
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,360
You mustn't drape a saree up!

358
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,520
You must drape it always below
your belly button.

359
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:22,380
Madam, I'm asking you nastily.

360
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:26,420
Is the groom coming to see her face
or her belly button?

361
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,470
Idiot! Give me the jewellery.

362
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,470
Mother, I can't bear the weight
of all this jewellery.

363
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:34,510
Then, we'll put all this jewellery to our
maid and make her stand next to her.

364
00:43:35,083 --> 00:43:35,469
Shut up!

365
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:39,320
Wear anyone! They've come.

366
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:47,340
Come!

367
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,320
Greetings! Greetings... greetings.

368
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,470
She greeted me, not you!

369
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:57,380
Did she greet you? I thought she
greeted me, so I greeted her.

370
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,310
Madam, cancel my greetings.
Sir... you greet her.

371
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:01,500
- Greetings!
- Greetings!

372
00:44:02,074 --> 00:44:02,605
Come in.

373
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:05,460
She had called me in... not you!

374
00:44:06,007 --> 00:44:06,509
Ok... let's go!

375
00:44:06,953 --> 00:44:07,414
Come!

376
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:10,320
- Sit down.
- Me? Or him?

377
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:11,320
Both of you sit down.

378
00:44:11,343 --> 00:44:11,809
Then, ok!

379
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,320
What would you like to have?

380
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,520
We'll have anything which
you may give?

381
00:44:18,409 --> 00:44:18,809
Yes, madam.

382
00:44:19,247 --> 00:44:19,758
Bring drinks.

383
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:23,320
In the same breath order glasses,
ice and chips also.

384
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:27,460
Drinks mean... not that drinks...
cool drinks... cool drinks.

385
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:29,430
Hasn't your wife come with you?

386
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:31,420
Where does he have a wife?

387
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:34,370
Unable to bear this
gentleman's tortures.

388
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:38,360
10 years ago, she doused herself with
10 ltrs. of kerosene and self immolated.

389
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:40,470
Fool... fool... fool...
don't crack nasty jokes.

390
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:42,310
They may think it to be true.

391
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:43,500
- Isn't it true?
- Look again, joking.

392
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:47,310
Don't take to his words.
He always plays comedy.

393
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:49,510
My wife died then, with plague.

394
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:53,310
What's this? When they said groom
is coming from America.

395
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:55,390
I thought, he'll be coming in a
suit and will be young.

396
00:44:55,490 --> 00:45:00,350
Why is he old like a cattle broker
of Peddapuram animal market.

397
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:01,520
Sunny! Is it second marriage for you?

398
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:05,430
Look, you're not able to differentiate
between Akkineni and Mikkilineni.

399
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:07,310
He's not the groom.

400
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:08,370
Nastily, you're not, isn't it?

401
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,430
I'm not the groom, nastily.

402
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:13,450
I'm father of the groom.
He's my P.A..

403
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,340
Then, where's the groom?

404
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:18,460
He went to the next village and said
he'll be coming with his friend.

405
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:20,310
By this time, he'll be on the way.

406
00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:38,520
Oh! God! Sorry...

407
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:44,440
Suddenly on seeing a genuine Telugu girl,
I forgot to blow horn.

408
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:45,500
Are you hurt?

409
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:49,340
I think the vessel is hurt.

410
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,490
Oh! God! It's major accidents only.

411
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:55,300
People at home may scold you.
Shall I buy you a new one?

412
00:45:57,310 --> 00:45:58,350
Can't you speak?

413
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:02,300
- No, I can't!
- Ok! Even that is also good.

414
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:04,470
Look, since you're dumb.

415
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:07,350
Since, you can't scold me,
if I say something...

416
00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:09,440
I'll tell courageously, what I've
in my heart.

417
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:11,440
You're very beautiful.

418
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:17,320
At first sight, I liked you
very much.

419
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:20,420
If you give my vessel
I'll go away.

420
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,490
Can you speak?

421
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,370
No, I'm totally dumb.

422
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:27,370
Not only beautiful, she's also clever.

423
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:29,310
What's this? Groom hasn't come yet.

424
00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:31,470
I've come... I've come.

425
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:33,370
I've brought the auspicious threads.

426
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,450
I'll tie the six knots.

427
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:36,370
Hey! Who are you?

428
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,500
What's this Aunty?

429
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:40,410
Why are you talking against me?
It's me!

430
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:42,480
Your both daughters famed husband.

431
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:47,380
Haven't you told about the greatness
of the amulet to mother-in-law?

432
00:46:48,490 --> 00:46:50,500
You're blabbering!
Have you gone mad?

433
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:54,510
Yes Your nieces are mad for love.
And I'm mad for marriage.

434
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:56,410
Everything is the greatness
of this amulet.

435
00:46:56,470 --> 00:46:57,460
What's all this non-sense?

436
00:46:57,958 --> 00:46:58,603
Marriage non-sense.

437
00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:00,320
Yes, madam.

438
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:01,380
Why are you standing and walking?

439
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,440
I thought you'll make a gesture
and I'll bash him up.

440
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:04,360
Lousy fellow!

441
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:05,460
First throw out this mad man.

442
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:10,400
Mother-in-law! You're insulting a
son-in-law, you'll pay for this sin.

443
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:12,510
Some madman! Don't take it seriously.

444
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:15,300
Why hasn't your son come yet?

445
00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:17,370
Maybe his car has given
trouble en route.

446
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:18,360
Look, Srisailam...

447
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:20,300
Will you go and come?
You go and come quickly.

448
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:21,300
I'll manage everything here.

449
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:22,330
I'll beat you with my slipper.

450
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,894
It's me who should be here and it's you
who should go and check out there.

451
00:47:25,157 --> 00:47:25,506
Go!

452
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:33,350
Excuse me! One minute.

453
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:36,450
You didn't scold me for spoiling
the shape of your vessel.

454
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:38,510
You didn't get angry for stopping
and talking to you.

455
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:41,360
That means... do you like me?

456
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:48,310
You're going away silently!
That means you like me, isn't it?

457
00:47:58,156 --> 00:47:58,371
You!

458
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:01,310
Everyone is waiting there for you
to come see the bride.

459
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,440
Why are you standing here
looking aimlessly?

460
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:06,440
I'm not looking aimlessly.
I'm looking at a bride.

461
00:48:07,012 --> 00:48:07,847
What are you saying?

462
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:12,360
I liked that girl! If I ever marry,
I'll marry only that Malleshwari.

463
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:13,360
Will you marry her?

464
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:16,480
This is on the tip of your son's tongue
but I said it.

465
00:48:16,965 --> 00:48:17,688
That's all, isn't it?

466
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:20,300
Then, tell him, what's on the
tip of my tongue?

467
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:24,300
You can't marry that girl! You must
marry only Vasundhara's daughter.

468
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:25,320
Impossible! I won't marry her.

469
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:28,340
When I'm asking you to get
into a flight.

470
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,470
Why do you want to get
into a rickshaw?

471
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,380
You've not seen Vasundhara's daughter.

472
00:48:31,490 --> 00:48:33,380
If you see her you'll fall
head over heels for her.

473
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:37,380
Yes, she's like great Goa beach
she'll never hide her body.

474
00:48:37,490 --> 00:48:39,300
She's very stingy with her clothes.

475
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:42,340
I didn't ask you to say that...
Tell about her beauty.

476
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,510
Elder daughter is Silk Smitha.
Younger daughter is Disco Shanthi.

477
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:47,340
Mother is Jyothilakshmi!

478
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:48,470
Even if she's miss India...
I won't marry her.

479
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,350
I'll marry only that Malleshwari
whether you agree or refuse.

480
00:48:52,410 --> 00:48:53,390
Son! I'm agreeing to your marriage.

481
00:48:53,450 --> 00:48:55,390
Who are you to agree?
It's me who should agree.

482
00:48:55,490 --> 00:48:57,470
If I say something even
you'll accept.

483
00:48:57,950 --> 00:48:58,293
That means!

484
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:03,520
In the temple land donated to
the farm hands.

485
00:49:04,410 --> 00:49:06,520
Crores of worth granite has been
found to exist there.

486
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:09,310
No one knows about it.

487
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:12,310
If you accept that girl as
your daughter-in-law.

488
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:14,350
That president will became our man.

489
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:17,350
Crores worth temple land
will become ones.

490
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:21,390
Oh! My great P.A.. Why did you hide
such a good news from me?

491
00:49:21,996 --> 00:49:23,782
Without any further delay!
Let's get them married.

492
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:25,400
I'm very happy, brother-in-law.

493
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:28,400
When such a rich man like you has come
forward on your own for my daughter.

494
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:29,440
What better luck can I
have than this.

495
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,360
The luck is not yours kinsman.

496
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:33,480
It's my luck that you've become
my kinsman.

497
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:35,310
What do you say, Srisailam?

498
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:37,520
It was on the tip of my tongue...
and you've said it.

499
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:41,360
Sir, you've come in hot sun.
Have this cool drink.

500
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:44,420
Did you like the groom?

501
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:48,300
If you like him, then I too
like him.

502
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:51,510
If you don't mind, I want to
ask you a question.

503
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:54,340
You're very rich people.

504
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:56,380
And your son is studying
in America.

505
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:59,380
If you want you can get proposals
from rich families.

506
00:49:59,450 --> 00:50:01,300
And millions as dowry.

507
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:05,510
What's the reason for coming
for my sister.

508
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,510
Money will come today...
vanish tomorrow.

509
00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:11,340
But honour, prestige are immortal.

510
00:50:11,450 --> 00:50:14,390
With that reason only he has come
with the proposal to you.

511
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:16,410
You may have come for any reason.

512
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:21,300
But I must give dowry according
to my status, isn't it.

513
00:50:21,390 --> 00:50:23,330
- If you make your wish...
- Dowry?

514
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:24,310
Come on, get up son!

515
00:50:24,510 --> 00:50:26,490
Why are you going away like that?

516
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:31,310
Is he appearing like a poverty
stricken man to you?

517
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:32,330
Then, don't you want dowry?

518
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:33,370
I won't accept even a single pie.

519
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:35,330
If you insist on giving! Then, I'm
going away, immediately.

520
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:37,330
Sir... please stop.

521
00:50:37,390 --> 00:50:41,330
Though you may not like, we're bride's
people, we've to give dowry, isn't it.

522
00:50:42,310 --> 00:50:44,460
Ok! Since you're very eager
to give dowry...

523
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:47,370
I'll ask and take it later.
What do you say, Srisailam?

524
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:50,330
- It was on the tip of my tongue
- And I said it, isn'it it?

525
00:50:51,310 --> 00:50:55,380
Don't know sir, I feel something strange
on seeing this Kota Pentaiah's face.

526
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:59,500
Don't know about father, but
son's photo's worth framing.

527
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:01,380
Don't rush into the decision.

528
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:04,320
Outside photo is ok but we
need an X-ray of inside.

529
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:05,470
That's what we need mainly.

530
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,500
Then, let's test him.

531
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:08,460
- Is it urine test or blood test?
- Not that.

532
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:11,380
Please come in!

533
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:15,320
Brother-in-law, you may have forgotten about
villages after staying in America.

534
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:17,420
- Come, let's go around the village.
- Ok! Let's go.

535
00:51:17,822 --> 00:51:19,828
You stay here! You're not the
one who went to foreign.

536
00:51:20,168 --> 00:51:20,663
He's the one.

537
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:23,300
You stay here and give him tips
which are on his tongue.

538
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:24,320
You come with us, sir!

539
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:26,490
This is main market centre
of our village.

540
00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:29,490
- Give me a pack of Karim Beedis and horse marked match box. - Yes sir.

541
00:51:29,978 --> 00:51:30,478
Sir!

542
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:34,460
Which is your brand?
Red Wills or Gold flake?

543
00:51:35,310 --> 00:51:37,400
- I don't smoke either cigarettes or Beedis.
- Then, you'll be smoking cigarettes.

544
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:40,310
Get me a Lanka tobacco cigar.

545
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:41,410
Our village tobacco cigars
are very famous.

546
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,500
I don't smoke anything.

547
00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:45,320
Sir, he's feeling very shy!

548
00:51:45,390 --> 00:51:46,490
No problem, I won't tell this
to my sister.

549
00:51:47,310 --> 00:51:49,330
Whether you tell your sister or not
I'm not bothered. I don't smoke.

550
00:51:52,311 --> 00:51:52,695
Brother-in-law... brother-in-law.

551
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:54,522
Brother-in-law!

552
00:51:55,310 --> 00:51:58,350
- Can you find Palm fruits and Wild Dates
freely in America like here? - No.

553
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:01,350
Then, you would be very
desperate to have arrack.

554
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:03,480
- Come, let's go to the hut and enjoy few drinks.
- I don't want.

555
00:52:04,310 --> 00:52:06,480
Why are you refusing?
It'll taste great, sweet and sour.

556
00:52:07,310 --> 00:52:08,310
It's very cool to the body.

557
00:52:08,350 --> 00:52:09,310
I don't have the habit.

558
00:52:09,350 --> 00:52:13,500
Sir, am I looking so foolish to you?

559
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:15,420
How can you say you don't have
habit staying in America?

560
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:19,310
Fool! In America you don't get arrack
so he didn't get into the habit.

561
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:23,380
Use my name and get me a bottle of
brandy from Boddu Surya Rao.

562
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,460
- We'll give him mixed with
tender coconut water! - Yes.

563
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,420
I don't have habit of drinking liquor.

564
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,340
In fact I hate people who
consume liquor.

565
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:33,320
- This is our village's little stream.
- Near by only...

566
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:35,440
- What's it Seetharam?
- Yes, I'm coming... coming...

567
00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:37,320
Why is he running away like this?

568
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:39,440
When he sees this group
he always runs away.

569
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:46,300
Sir, what are you ogling at?

570
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:47,300
I'm looking at the fields!

571
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:48,450
Why are you seeing the fields?
Look at the girls.

572
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:51,410
They're very famous girls
around this place.

573
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:53,300
They won't refuse anyone
when approached.

574
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:57,320
Sir, why did you slap me?

575
00:52:57,390 --> 00:52:59,370
Otherwise, do you find me
like a Casanova?

576
00:52:59,430 --> 00:53:02,450
Brother-in-law! You've passed in our tests...
passed in our tests.

577
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:08,330
Mr. Ramachandra!

578
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:10,370
What's the meaning of your stare?

579
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:12,490
Generally, I used to bow with
two hands folded together.

580
00:53:13,350 --> 00:53:16,370
Are you surprised at seeing me
bowing you with just one hand?

581
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:17,390
There's reason for it.

582
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,330
My sister's marriage has been fixed.

583
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:23,460
Till now, you were epitome for all
good qualities of a husband.

584
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,330
Hereafter, you're not just
the one man?

585
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:26,500
My brother-in-law has come
as a competitor to you.

586
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,370
Look, mother Seetha!

587
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,340
Your husband didn't marry
you just like that.

588
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,420
He had taken a kingdom as dowry from
your father to marry you.

589
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:39,380
My brother-in-law is going to marry
my sister without any dowry.

590
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,460
Who's great, your husband or
my brother-in-law?

591
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:46,470
Mr. Hanumanth...! You can get up
from that place.

592
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:49,460
You settled here considering
lord Rama and Seetha as ideal couple.

593
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:52,500
My sister and brother-in-law have
come as competitor to them.

594
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:56,320
So, switching your loyalty to my sister
and brother-in-law will be better.

595
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:58,360
Try to understand why I'm saying it.

596
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:01,330
Mr. Lakshman! You too!

597
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:02,340
If you come quickly...

598
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:05,300
We can go to Rama studio and get
ourselves photographed as a group.

599
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:09,500
Considering you as my boss
I went little overboard.

600
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:11,450
Don't take it to heart.
I'll go Nov.

601
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:13,320
Farm workers are doing
weeding out work.

602
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:19,340
Did you see? I forgot to say the
real thing in my talk.

603
00:54:20,370 --> 00:54:22,390
You must look after my sister and
brother-in-law nicely.

604
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:25,300
You'll, isn't it? You'll.
I know that.

605
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:26,410
Thank you, sir!

606
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:36,310
Lord! Give me a boon to be born in all
my births as his sister only.

607
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:42,430
Refusing our Pappi, is he marrying
that president's daughter?

608
00:54:43,310 --> 00:54:45,310
Yes, sister, they've exchanged
symbolic proposals also.

609
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,520
Will that Kota Pentaiah dare
to cheat me?

610
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:50,440
We promised to give him
everything he asks for.

611
00:54:51,310 --> 00:54:53,480
A napkin to cover the skin head...?
A pillow to sleep?

612
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:55,844
Is she really a woman?

613
00:54:56,370 --> 00:54:58,440
Will she kiss him on the nuptial night
if he marries her?

614
00:54:58,500 --> 00:54:59,520
Will she caress him?

615
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:02,480
Will she at least give some place
to sleep on her bed?

616
00:55:03,330 --> 00:55:05,520
She's hot headed to make her
husband massage her legs.

617
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:07,440
How can he be happy if
he marries her?

618
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:11,440
Ok! Refusing the elder brat and
if he goes for the younger brat.

619
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:16,360
She'll wink at the priest in marriage.
And will call the musician aside.

620
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:20,420
Still considering yours as a
good family and adjusts to it.

621
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:25,340
This bull runs into women like in
china to ruin their chastity.

622
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,470
Next, when it come to your matter...

623
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:30,340
You've taken to streets like a man
leaving a husband.

624
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:35,470
What did you blabber?

625
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:40,300
Kill him... kill him.

626
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:44,370
Why have you all joined together
and beating me nastily?

627
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:46,460
Otherwise, will you dare to blabber
anything you feel like?

628
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:49,370
These words were not mine.

629
00:55:50,330 --> 00:55:53,430
What Seetharam and his father said
to Kota Pentaiah...

630
00:55:54,330 --> 00:55:56,310
I heard it and was repeating
it for you.

631
00:55:56,410 --> 00:55:57,470
Did they say like that? Why?

632
00:55:58,310 --> 00:56:01,310
To spoil Pappi's marriage and get
their daughter married to him.

633
00:56:02,330 --> 00:56:03,520
I'll see... I'll see that also.

634
00:56:04,330 --> 00:56:05,520
What will you see?
That girl's marriage?

635
00:56:06,370 --> 00:56:08,430
No, their cries.

636
00:56:12,001 --> 00:56:12,691
Look, he's coming.

637
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:16,520
With this strike, he must lose his brain and
come after us like a madman.

638
00:56:28,310 --> 00:56:31,420
What's this, blue babies?
They're running free public shows.

639
00:56:32,310 --> 00:56:34,460
Hey, you mustn't bath in this lake.

640
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:37,460
- We won't bath.
- We'll swim.

641
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:41,320
This is not a place to swim.
It's a drinking water lake.

642
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:45,340
If you're so interested to swim, there's
another lake near by, go there.

643
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,320
That place will suit your bodies.

644
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:48,380
We'll swim here only.

645
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:50,340
Do whatever you wish to do.

646
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:56,430
They're not just ordinary brats.
They're super brats.

647
00:56:56,490 --> 00:57:00,300
Are you going to come out
from it or not?

648
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:01,340
If we refuse to come out...

649
00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:02,510
Your heads will be blown away.

650
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:04,300
Go ahead! Let me see how you'll
blow it away.

651
00:57:04,450 --> 00:57:07,300
City girls! You won't believe
in words...

652
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:10,300
I'll show you the deed of
village power.

653
00:57:18,490 --> 00:57:19,390
That's it.

654
00:57:20,330 --> 00:57:22,520
- Sister, he's taking away my dress.
- He has taken away mine also.

655
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:27,310
What do you think of yourself?
That's it.

656
00:57:27,350 --> 00:57:30,410
Aren't you ashamed of
disrobing a woman?

657
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,310
Why should I feel ashamed?

658
00:57:32,430 --> 00:57:36,410
You must feel ashamed for bathing in a
drinking water lake in a swim suit.

659
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,330
Are you going to return our
dresses or not?

660
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:40,420
Say sorry, that you'll never do
such foolish acts again.

661
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:41,500
I'll return your clothes.

662
00:57:42,330 --> 00:57:43,350
We won't say sorry at any cost.

663
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,440
Go and lift it.

664
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:46,400
I'll lift.

665
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:47,520
Where are you going this side?

666
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:50,310
You asked me to lift, isn't it.
I thought of lifting them out.

667
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:51,360
I didn't ask you to lift them.

668
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:52,400
I meant gates.

669
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:55,360
I've understood it.

670
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:56,400
You're finished.

671
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:09,500
Water is leaking out.

672
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:12,330
Will you say sorry or
get publicly humiliated?

673
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:13,440
We won't say sorry at any cost.

674
00:58:14,510 --> 00:58:17,490
Fantastic darling! Keep up your word.

675
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:19,400
We'll see what will happen next.

676
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:32,410
Water level is going down rapidly.
Shall we say sorry?

677
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:34,300
How can we say sorry shamelessly?

678
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:37,300
If we wait for one more minute...
we may have to die in shame.

679
00:58:38,090 --> 00:58:38,666
Yes.

680
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:40,450
Are there any leeches in the lake?

681
00:58:41,310 --> 00:58:43,450
Not just leeches, there are
snakes also!

682
00:58:44,350 --> 00:58:45,330
Don't get up.

683
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:47,330
It seems there are leeches and snakes.

684
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:49,370
They may bite us. We'll say
sorry to them.

685
00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:52,330
Look Seetharam! Sorry for
getting into the lake.

686
00:58:52,470 --> 00:58:53,500
It's not enough if you
say it alone.

687
00:58:54,350 --> 00:58:55,410
Ask your sister also to say it.

688
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:57,330
Sister! Please say sorry.

689
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:02,380
That's it! Wear it.

690
00:59:05,370 --> 00:59:06,310
Close it... close it.

691
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:20,370
Never again clash with my boss,
you'll end up cut up to size.

692
00:59:20,470 --> 00:59:22,330
In front of the people, you had
insulted us.

693
00:59:22,470 --> 00:59:24,450
In front of the same people if
we don't insult you...

694
00:59:25,007 --> 00:59:26,553
We're not brat sisters.

695
00:59:26,610 --> 00:59:27,550
Hey, you get lost.

696
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,310
No one is there in the house.

697
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,330
If there is no one, then
who's speaking?

698
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:56,460
It means, my brother and father
have gone to Rajamundri.

699
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:58,500
So, I've come in a good time.

700
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:00,340
Why did you come?

701
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:01,460
Shouldn't I come?

702
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:04,380
Why do you treat me as an outsider
and make me stand outside?

703
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:06,320
Please come and sit inside.

704
01:00:09,470 --> 01:00:11,450
Won't you offer anything
to your groom?

705
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:13,410
What will you have?

706
01:00:14,350 --> 01:00:15,330
I'll have anything you give.

707
01:00:28,044 --> 01:00:28,619
Take it.

708
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:37,360
Leave me.

709
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,310
If someone sees us, it'll
not be nice.

710
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:41,440
You only told that there's
no one in the house.

711
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:43,520
What's wrong, if they see us?

712
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:46,440
Anyway, we're going to be
husband and wife.

713
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:49,480
I'm going to America tomorrow.

714
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:51,440
When will you come back?

715
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:53,300
After 4 months.

716
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:56,490
I came to see you to remember
you till then.

717
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:58,569
Take the buttermilk.

718
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:02,320
- I don't need buttermilk.
- Then, what?

719
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:14,410
What's it...? Leave me.

720
01:01:14,510 --> 01:01:17,300
I'll leave you only when you
forgive me and my sister.

721
01:01:17,370 --> 01:01:19,340
What idiotic thing have you done?

722
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:24,370
I mistook that you fixed alliance for
your sister with my sister's fiancee.

723
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:27,450
After knowing that it wasn't
your mistake.

724
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:30,450
I haven't even had a single cup
of coffee also.

725
01:01:31,310 --> 01:01:32,490
I'll go only when you forgive me.

726
01:01:33,310 --> 01:01:34,310
Yes, I have forgiven you.
Go... go...

727
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:35,510
Can I and my sister eat food?

728
01:01:36,241 --> 01:01:37,383
You can also eat this hay,
if you wish to.

729
01:01:50,350 --> 01:01:52,310
Hey, what happened to you again?

730
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:53,500
The labourers are coming in
this direction only.

731
01:01:54,025 --> 01:01:54,621
What's bothering you,
if they come?

732
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:58,330
If they see me with you
near this hay stack...

733
01:01:58,430 --> 01:01:59,450
They'll mistake me as your lover.

734
01:01:59,510 --> 01:02:02,300
It's ok, if they mistake me...
since I am a woman.

735
01:02:02,350 --> 01:02:04,410
But you are a bachelor.
You'll be in trouble.

736
01:02:04,510 --> 01:02:05,490
Then, what are you going
to do now?

737
01:02:06,047 --> 01:02:06,735
I'll hide in the hay stack.

738
01:02:07,350 --> 01:02:08,330
Make sure that they don't come
this way.

739
01:02:12,430 --> 01:02:13,490
Buddy...

740
01:02:16,350 --> 01:02:17,330
What's this?

741
01:02:17,430 --> 01:02:18,370
What's this?

742
01:02:19,050 --> 01:02:19,556
You've seen, isn't it?

743
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:23,310
I saw you picking up hay
with both of my eyes.

744
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,410
- You saw me picking up hay.
- Yes.

745
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:26,330
Ok.

746
01:02:26,390 --> 01:02:27,370
Do you think I'm dead?

747
01:02:28,310 --> 01:02:30,410
If I'm late, will you pick up
hay by yourself?

748
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:31,420
What's wrong in it?

749
01:02:31,875 --> 01:02:33,874
Ok, don't do such mistakes again
in the future.

750
01:02:34,224 --> 01:02:34,775
Hey... hey...

751
01:02:35,028 --> 01:02:35,593
Why are you taking that?

752
01:02:35,936 --> 01:02:36,794
To feed the calves.

753
01:02:37,097 --> 01:02:37,461
I'll feed them, you can go.

754
01:02:38,450 --> 01:02:41,430
You mean to say that you'll pick up and
feed the hay yourself.

755
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:43,350
- What's wrong in doing our work?
- Sir.

756
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:46,470
If you are angry, you can hit me
with your slippers.

757
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:49,430
But don't do such silly things.

758
01:02:50,450 --> 01:02:51,510
Hey... I told you that I'll
feed them, isn't it?

759
01:02:52,330 --> 01:02:55,360
- You go that side.
- Oh! My god!

760
01:02:58,370 --> 01:02:59,520
Sir, did you see my sister?

761
01:03:02,310 --> 01:03:03,310
She told that she's coming
to meet you.

762
01:03:09,330 --> 01:03:10,350
How did my sister's upper cloth
come here?

763
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:20,470
Has my sister gone?

764
01:03:22,490 --> 01:03:25,390
Has the oily face Abbulu and
the labourers gone?

765
01:03:27,450 --> 01:03:28,390
Thank god!

766
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:32,350
I thought that everyone had gone.

767
01:03:32,410 --> 01:03:33,470
Why didn't you tell me that
they are still here, darling?

768
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:35,430
How dare you call him, darling?

769
01:03:35,924 --> 01:03:36,654
Forgive me, sister.

770
01:03:37,370 --> 01:03:38,520
Seetharam and I are in love.

771
01:03:39,410 --> 01:03:39,784
It's a lie.

772
01:03:40,370 --> 01:03:42,390
He's in love with me, not with you.

773
01:03:42,450 --> 01:03:45,310
No, he's in love with me and said that
he'll marry me only.

774
01:03:45,410 --> 01:03:47,350
He had promised me the same
in the temple.

775
01:03:48,310 --> 01:03:49,520
Taking me in to his lap,
he kissed me and said.

776
01:03:50,370 --> 01:03:52,480
Seetharam, will you deceive
me like this?

777
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:54,500
Seetharam, will you cheat
me like this?

778
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:58,310
You are not Seetharam,
you're a cheater Ram.

779
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:00,320
You are not lord Ram.
You're evil Ravana.

780
01:04:00,430 --> 01:04:01,490
Why are you staring at us?

781
01:04:02,190 --> 01:04:02,666
Take him to village committee.

782
01:04:03,017 --> 01:04:03,340
Yes.

783
01:04:03,470 --> 01:04:06,410
Buddy, are they telling the truth?

784
01:04:07,470 --> 01:04:08,370
Yes, it's a fact.

785
01:04:09,430 --> 01:04:11,330
All these days, we thought
that you're a good man.

786
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:14,450
We should not leave you for
deceiving the 2 sisters.

787
01:04:14,510 --> 01:04:16,370
Yes, he must be punished.

788
01:04:16,510 --> 01:04:19,370
Will you agree to whatever
punishment we give him?

789
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:20,310
We agree.

790
01:04:20,350 --> 01:04:21,310
What do you say?

791
01:04:21,470 --> 01:04:22,490
What is left to say?

792
01:04:23,350 --> 01:04:25,370
Since their fair name has been
spoilt because of me.

793
01:04:26,310 --> 01:04:28,410
Because of that, no one will come
forward to marry them.

794
01:04:29,350 --> 01:04:33,310
I'll tie the auspicious threads and
take them both as my wives.

795
01:04:33,390 --> 01:04:34,310
Stop it.

796
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,370
They tied the amulets to me.

797
01:04:37,310 --> 01:04:38,500
It's me who should tie the
auspicious threads.

798
01:04:39,081 --> 01:04:39,758
You can tie in your next birth.

799
01:04:40,350 --> 01:04:41,310
Let me tie in this birth.

800
01:04:42,243 --> 01:04:42,757
Catch them...

801
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:42,420
The invitation is very good.

802
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:43,420
Thank you very much.

803
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:47,340
- Distribute these invitations to your
relatives on behalf of us. - Ok.

804
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:52,320
Brother-in-law, when you said that
you'll give dowry to my son...

805
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:54,510
I said that I'll ask for it
when I need it.

806
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:56,310
Do you remember, brother-in-law?

807
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:58,420
Why not? Please ask whatever you want.

808
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:02,380
I want the temple's farm lands, which
you gave away to the farm hands.

809
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:08,390
Your son-in-law wants to build a factory
in that 500 acres of land.

810
01:10:08,510 --> 01:10:09,480
Please forgive me.

811
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:11,390
I've given that to farm hands.

812
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:13,300
Ask them to give it back.

813
01:10:13,410 --> 01:10:14,520
Will they deny, if you ask for it?

814
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:18,340
Though they won't deny it, I can't take
what I had given as charity.

815
01:10:18,490 --> 01:10:20,510
If you say so, this marriage
won't be conducted.

816
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:22,350
Brother-in-law!

817
01:10:22,450 --> 01:10:26,470
If you want to call me like that, you
must write the farm land to my son.

818
01:10:27,330 --> 01:10:29,510
Brother-in-law, if you want, I'll write
house and farm land on his name.

819
01:10:30,330 --> 01:10:32,320
Who needs your farm land or house?

820
01:10:32,450 --> 01:10:36,390
Our Kota agreed to the marriage only
because of the temple farm land.

821
01:10:36,450 --> 01:10:37,470
- What do you say?
- You're right.

822
01:10:38,330 --> 01:10:40,350
You had spoken what I thought.

823
01:10:40,450 --> 01:10:42,350
Don't stop the marriage for which
the invitations had been printed.

824
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:44,310
Consider this as your legs,
not your hands.

825
01:10:44,370 --> 01:10:46,520
You won't agree to write temple's
farm land on my son's name.

826
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:48,480
It's not fair on your part to
ask for it.

827
01:10:49,310 --> 01:10:51,310
So, it's not fair to conduct
the marriage also.

828
01:10:53,420 --> 01:10:55,300
Look out for another alliance
for your daughter.

829
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:06,310
Greetings, sir.

830
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:10,350
What's it Krishnamurthy?

831
01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:12,360
It seems you've fixed the auspicious
time for your daughter's marriage.

832
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:13,380
When is it?

833
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:19,440
Sir, I'll cut the nails of your daughter
during the marriage.

834
01:11:19,510 --> 01:11:21,320
Sir, don't tell Surya.

835
01:11:24,510 --> 01:11:28,500
Sir, are 25 people enough to carry
the bride's dowry?

836
01:11:48,510 --> 01:11:52,390
Father, I've given advance to
music troupe and Band people.

837
01:11:52,470 --> 01:11:54,470
Asking Kanaka Rao to bring
the garlands.

838
01:11:55,350 --> 01:11:58,410
I've sent our Abbulu to
bring crackers.

839
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:02,300
Aunty said, she'll go to Rajamundri
to buy silk sarees.

840
01:12:02,350 --> 01:12:03,410
I asked them to buy it from Kanchipuram.

841
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:06,300
What about dress materials to
the groom's people?

842
01:12:07,310 --> 01:12:08,320
There is no need.

843
01:12:08,350 --> 01:12:10,500
Father, why those tears
in your eyes?

844
01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:21,450
This year the guard size
is good but...

845
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:26,390
Greetings, Mrs. Vasundhara! I was going
to your house only.

846
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:27,330
You came across.

847
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:28,310
Why did you come again?

848
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:30,310
To make your daughter as
my daughter-in-law.

849
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:31,340
I'll hit you with my slippers.

850
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:35,480
The day you refused our proposal
and accepted president's daughter.

851
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:37,430
I knew that day itself about
your cheap mentality.

852
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:39,470
Didn't I tell you, she'll say these
words only! Come, let's go.

853
01:12:39,862 --> 01:12:40,303
Shut up! Idiot!

854
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:43,320
Let bygones be bygones.

855
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:44,380
Forget it as a bad dream.

856
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:45,520
And think that he had dreamt it.

857
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:48,320
It seems coming 23rd is an
auspicious day.

858
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:50,400
If you say yes, I'll fix the marriage.

859
01:12:50,891 --> 01:12:51,453
What do you say, Srisailam?

860
01:12:51,490 --> 01:12:54,320
It was on the tip of my tongue
and you said it.

861
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:56,320
Then, what about Seetharam's sister?

862
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:59,320
We had little differences in
dowry and dropped it.

863
01:12:59,396 --> 01:12:59,851
Means?

864
01:13:00,410 --> 01:13:02,300
So, you've come thinking, you'll
get more dowry here.

865
01:13:02,410 --> 01:13:04,460
It was on the tip of my tongue,
you said it.

866
01:13:05,370 --> 01:13:08,430
What's guarantee that you won't go
elsewhere, if you get still more.

867
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:11,350
- Sir?
- Shut up man!

868
01:13:11,410 --> 01:13:14,410
Look, I and president may have
many problems between us.

869
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:17,380
But I don't have a wish to
spoil her marriage.

870
01:13:17,450 --> 01:13:19,350
With my daughter's marriage.

871
01:13:20,310 --> 01:13:21,460
President's daughter is like
my daughter only.

872
01:13:24,450 --> 01:13:28,480
Don't act like a fool. Come to senses
and accept her as your daughter-in-law.

873
01:13:29,310 --> 01:13:31,300
How can he accept without
getting good dowry?

874
01:13:31,330 --> 01:13:35,350
Yuck, for silly dowry, will you
refuse a good girl?

875
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:38,500
It's your luck to get such a goddess
like girl as your daughter-in-law.

876
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:42,360
If you refuse her not only
in this village.

877
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:44,490
I'll ensure that your son won't get
a bride in this district itself.

878
01:13:45,310 --> 01:13:48,360
Going overboard for falling
at your feet.

879
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:51,400
If not that girl or your daughter...
won't my son ever get married?

880
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:52,480
Can't I get a daughter-in-law
to my house?

881
01:13:53,310 --> 01:13:55,470
Madam, I've also studied
social studies.

882
01:13:56,310 --> 01:13:59,320
Andhra Pradesh has many districts,
not just this one.

883
01:13:59,689 --> 01:14:00,040
What do you say, Srisailam?

884
01:14:00,298 --> 01:14:04,030
- It was on the tip of my tongue.
- You said it nastily.

885
01:14:04,309 --> 01:14:04,701
Go... go away.

886
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:07,310
We'll go away! Do you think we
are shameless people?

887
01:14:07,348 --> 01:14:07,750
Come, let's go.

888
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:12,360
Go man!

889
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:16,300
Avaricious fools.

890
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:20,400
I thought you'll accept the proposal
for the enemity with Seetharam.

891
01:14:20,470 --> 01:14:22,410
Refusing their proposal you had saved
honour of this village.

892
01:14:22,470 --> 01:14:24,300
I just managed to save
village's honour.

893
01:14:24,470 --> 01:14:26,330
But couldn't save the honour
of Mr. president.

894
01:14:26,390 --> 01:14:27,380
Why are you saying like that, madam?

895
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:29,310
You told them to accept Malleshwari
as their daughter-in-law.

896
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:30,340
I told them but they won't accept.

897
01:14:30,470 --> 01:14:32,400
He doesn't want just the bride.

898
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:36,350
He wants the temple land donated
to you by president.

899
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:38,370
Has the marriage been stopped
for temple land?

900
01:14:38,430 --> 01:14:40,320
That's what, she's saying, isn't it?

901
01:14:40,390 --> 01:14:44,370
If you say that girl's marriage will
happen. We're ready to return lands.

902
01:14:44,430 --> 01:14:46,420
What will happen nastily.
If you alone return it?

903
01:14:47,310 --> 01:14:48,330
All others must join you, isn't it?

904
01:14:48,390 --> 01:14:50,320
We'll also return it.

905
01:14:50,430 --> 01:14:53,330
She is not just Mr. Krishnamurthy's
daughter, she's like our daughter too.

906
01:14:53,390 --> 01:14:55,460
Marriage is their family is like
marriage in our family.

907
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:57,410
Tell us madam, we'll sign
any papers.

908
01:14:57,480 --> 01:14:59,340
We'll put thumb impression
wherever you ask us to.

909
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:15,350
Throw this on his face and
get that girl married.

910
01:15:22,414 --> 01:15:22,847
Stop!

911
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:27,310
You asked me to get out and
why are you getting in?

912
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:31,410
She had asked you to get out, isn't it?
So, she has come with temple lands.

913
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:33,390
How could you get it?

914
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:35,340
I beat them with sentiment.

915
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:37,510
Foolish people put their impressions
like foolish goats.

916
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:42,470
Brother's dream has come true.
A sister's heart is filled with joy.

917
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:45,360
Temple's lands have reached home.

918
01:15:45,450 --> 01:15:47,480
Give it to me, I'll keep it
safely in the locker.

919
01:15:49,490 --> 01:15:51,480
She's more clever than you.

920
01:15:53,410 --> 01:15:58,420
You'll get the temple lands, the day
your son marries my daughter.

921
01:15:59,410 --> 01:16:01,430
As soon as my son comes from America
we'll perform their marriage.

922
01:16:01,490 --> 01:16:04,310
- Sister! A great good news.
- What is it?

923
01:16:04,370 --> 01:16:06,340
That Seetharam's sister has slipped.

924
01:16:06,450 --> 01:16:08,520
It's rainy season, isn't it?
She might have slipped.

925
01:16:09,330 --> 01:16:10,320
Any fractures?

926
01:16:10,410 --> 01:16:13,360
Slipped doesn't mean that slipped.
She's carrying! She's pregnant.

927
01:16:16,410 --> 01:16:19,480
This weapon is enough...
to ruin his prestige.

928
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:10,300
Father!

929
01:17:12,370 --> 01:17:13,300
Father!

930
01:17:33,157 --> 01:17:33,462
Stop.

931
01:17:34,350 --> 01:17:37,500
Killing our god like Krishnamurthy.
Have you come like devil to garland him?

932
01:17:37,957 --> 01:17:38,777
Shameless creature.

933
01:17:39,380 --> 01:17:41,490
Did I kill him?
What did I do?

934
01:17:42,177 --> 01:17:42,691
What did you do?

935
01:17:43,340 --> 01:17:44,490
Promising to get president's
daughter married.

936
01:17:45,340 --> 01:17:48,300
You took our thumb impressions, went
there and stopped the marriage.

937
01:17:48,340 --> 01:17:50,430
Unable to bear that insult
he hanged himself to death.

938
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:54,320
Look, you're unnecessarily
mistaking me.

939
01:17:54,510 --> 01:17:56,490
President didn't die for the
stopping of marriage...

940
01:17:57,430 --> 01:18:00,370
But because his daughter had
become pregnant before marriage.

941
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:06,490
Kota Pentaiah didn't reject this
proposal because of dowry.

942
01:18:07,470 --> 01:18:10,310
His future daughter-in-law became
pregnant with her paramour.

943
01:18:10,390 --> 01:18:11,370
What's this wild accusation?

944
01:18:15,310 --> 01:18:16,370
You're alive just because
you're a woman.

945
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:19,500
In chastity, my sister is equal
to goddess Seetha.

946
01:18:20,430 --> 01:18:22,450
My sister is epitome of chastity
like Arundhathi.

947
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:25,520
For justice and righteousness
my father is an exemplary example.

948
01:18:26,450 --> 01:18:28,310
My father, who always brought
good justice to everyone...

949
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:30,430
Had died because of your
treachery only.

950
01:18:30,490 --> 01:18:32,480
If yours is such a honourable family...

951
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:36,320
How can your sister had become pregnant
prior to marriage?

952
01:18:36,490 --> 01:18:38,300
She didn't become pregnant
to none other than...

953
01:18:39,490 --> 01:18:42,360
Her future husband...
that Kota's son.

954
01:18:42,410 --> 01:18:43,470
Why didn't Kota accept this marriage?

955
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:46,400
For refusing to give the temple lands
donated to poor people as dowry.

956
01:18:46,450 --> 01:18:49,390
If that is true, then let me see
get your sister married to his son.

957
01:18:49,450 --> 01:18:51,380
I'll perform! I'll definitely do it.

958
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:54,310
In front of the same people before
whom you had insulted my sister.

959
01:18:54,370 --> 01:18:57,360
Before the same people whom you ruined
my father's honour and brought his death.

960
01:18:57,410 --> 01:19:00,470
I'll prove before them that
my sister is chaste woman.

961
01:19:01,310 --> 01:19:04,350
I'll prove that my father was
killed because of you.

962
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:08,685
I'll make Kota's son marry
my sister.

963
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:21,340
I'm calling you only.

964
01:19:21,410 --> 01:19:22,430
My auto is dumb.

965
01:19:22,490 --> 01:19:24,350
I didn't call your auto...
I had called you.

966
01:19:24,464 --> 01:19:24,794
What?

967
01:19:25,446 --> 01:19:25,772
Will you come?

968
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:29,410
- Where shall we go?
- To my house?

969
01:19:34,340 --> 01:19:37,360
That means! Do I look like a
cheap slut to you? Idiot!

970
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:40,300
Early morning, I got beaten up
for going wrong side.

971
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:43,320
What?

972
01:19:43,420 --> 01:19:44,320
Any cases?

973
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:48,480
I've been plying auto for 5 years.
Till now not one case has been registered.

974
01:19:49,380 --> 01:19:51,320
I didn't ask about that cases.

975
01:19:51,470 --> 01:19:54,430
- That case!
- Oh! That case!

976
01:19:55,380 --> 01:19:57,320
You see, a suit case is going
there just now.

977
01:19:57,430 --> 01:19:58,340
Go and get yourself booked.

978
01:20:01,317 --> 01:20:01,753
Be careful!

979
01:20:08,390 --> 01:20:11,320
- How's the case?
- Terrible mental case.

980
01:20:11,470 --> 01:20:14,300
Go to police and get your teeth reset.

981
01:20:14,390 --> 01:20:16,310
Nasty face! He wants a case.

982
01:20:16,350 --> 01:20:17,430
Hey auto! Will you ply?

983
01:20:19,310 --> 01:20:20,460
Hey, aren't you Kondababu?

984
01:20:21,310 --> 01:20:24,320
You're... Mr. Krishnamurthy's son
Seetharam, isn't it?

985
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:25,450
How come you're here?

986
01:20:26,310 --> 01:20:27,320
I've come on an important work.

987
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:29,430
Is there any good hotel nearby?

988
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:31,350
There's one near by only.
Come, I'll take you there.

989
01:20:37,480 --> 01:20:38,440
- I'll go sir!
- Keep it here.

990
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:40,420
- Get me drinking water.
- Please, sit here.

991
01:20:43,310 --> 01:20:44,440
- How's the room sir?
- Fine.

992
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:48,350
If you don't have any work, stay
with my sister for half an hour.

993
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:49,460
- I'll go out and come.
- Yes sir.

994
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:51,520
- Where are you going, brother?
- I'll go to brother-in-law's house.

995
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:55,440
- Brother!
- What is it?

996
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:58,490
Brother, he's a very good man.

997
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:01,360
Don't abuse him in haste.

998
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:05,300
I can't bear even a spec falling
into your eyes.

999
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:08,340
Can I bear to see tears
in your eyes?

1000
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:12,410
I'll never do any work which
can hurt your feelings.

1001
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:17,350
Without your son here and
without knowing his idea...

1002
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:20,300
Betrothal means...
I feel strange.

1003
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:22,510
It was on the tip of my tongue
and you said it.

1004
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:25,310
If Junior boss, had been here...

1005
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:29,420
- He would've slapped him and
put some sense into you. - Why?

1006
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:33,440
Asking me why? Already he has fallen
in love with Seetharam's sister.

1007
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:36,460
How can he refuse that goddess like girl
and marry her brass girl?

1008
01:21:37,103 --> 01:21:37,636
By tying the knot.

1009
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:39,480
Foolish P.A..

1010
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,420
I'll make that golden statute
to rust...

1011
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:45,340
And gave this brass statute
a golden coating.

1012
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:47,340
With that my son will
fall in love.

1013
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:50,400
Then, why are you delaying?
Exchange the proposal.

1014
01:22:04,148 --> 01:22:04,490
Have you come?

1015
01:22:05,410 --> 01:22:08,410
You'll make an entry like this,
you'll kick the plate like this.

1016
01:22:08,490 --> 01:22:09,470
I had expected this to happen.

1017
01:22:09,896 --> 01:22:10,353
Shut up!

1018
01:22:11,450 --> 01:22:12,320
What's this atrocity?

1019
01:22:13,490 --> 01:22:17,520
If injustice is done to my sister...
not just atrocity... I'll behead you.

1020
01:22:20,410 --> 01:22:23,370
If ever your son marries,
he must marry my sister only.

1021
01:22:24,330 --> 01:22:25,350
If anyone comes as daughter-in-law
to this house.

1022
01:22:25,410 --> 01:22:26,360
Only my sister must come.

1023
01:22:27,410 --> 01:22:30,430
You must tie festoons only when my
sister enters this house.

1024
01:22:31,310 --> 01:22:32,370
You must apply turmeric
to the threshold.

1025
01:22:33,330 --> 01:22:36,480
Any auspicious function must be celebrated
only after my sister comes here.

1026
01:22:37,330 --> 01:22:40,310
If you make her shed tears
failing to do all this...

1027
01:22:41,310 --> 01:22:42,440
I'll turn this home into a grave.

1028
01:22:44,330 --> 01:22:46,480
The same dialogue was on the
tip of my tongue. He said it.

1029
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:51,500
Same slap! I thought of slapping
him, but slapped you.

1030
01:22:53,023 --> 01:22:56,867
This is just advance. If you accomplish
the job, I'll pay you 1 more lakh.

1031
01:22:58,340 --> 01:22:59,300
Tell me, what you want me to do?

1032
01:22:59,380 --> 01:23:05,370
Tomorrow, my son is flying back to
India saying I love India.

1033
01:23:05,420 --> 01:23:06,480
As soon as he gets down...

1034
01:23:08,420 --> 01:23:10,400
Saying like this, he'll straight
away go to Malleshwari.

1035
01:23:10,450 --> 01:23:13,370
If he goes there, Seetharam will
tell him the truth and...

1036
01:23:13,510 --> 01:23:15,370
Get his sister married to him.

1037
01:23:15,430 --> 01:23:18,320
- So...
- Your son mustn't meet them.

1038
01:23:18,350 --> 01:23:21,340
Even if he meets them, he must
refuse her to marry.

1039
01:23:21,430 --> 01:23:23,320
- That's all, isn't it?
- You're right.

1040
01:23:23,430 --> 01:23:28,320
You receive your son and come directly
to the hotel in which they're staying.

1041
01:23:37,510 --> 01:23:40,470
Who're you? What's all this?

1042
01:23:41,430 --> 01:23:42,370
Pearl Designs.

1043
01:23:42,510 --> 01:23:44,460
You're a prostitute, I'm a customer.

1044
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:47,380
Arrest him.

1045
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:49,692
What's all this? Please leave me.

1046
01:23:53,310 --> 01:23:54,430
- Please leave me...
- Hey! Come with us.

1047
01:23:57,350 --> 01:23:59,470
You didn't believe my words, isn't it?
See it yourself.

1048
01:24:03,350 --> 01:24:04,430
- Dear!
- Shut up!

1049
01:24:07,310 --> 01:24:08,480
Leave me. Dear!

1050
01:24:09,363 --> 01:24:09,735
Drive the car.

1051
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:11,520
- Dear!
- Where are you going?

1052
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:13,380
Dear...

1053
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:16,470
Leave me... leave me.

1054
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:18,500
Shut your mouth and get into
the jeep.

1055
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:22,340
Go!

1056
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:38,360
What's this? Room is like this...

1057
01:24:39,082 --> 01:24:39,770
Something has happened here.

1058
01:24:44,300 --> 01:24:45,380
Sir! Did you see my sister?

1059
01:24:45,450 --> 01:24:47,300
Just now, police arrested
and took her away.

1060
01:24:47,410 --> 01:24:49,300
Police arrested... why?

1061
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:50,360
For prostitution.

1062
01:24:50,450 --> 01:24:51,430
What did you blabber?

1063
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:53,520
Hey, stop! Why are you beating him?

1064
01:24:54,450 --> 01:24:55,470
Will he dare to call my sister
a prostitute?

1065
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:58,300
Police have told that, if possible
go and beat them.

1066
01:24:58,370 --> 01:24:59,300
Where's the police station?
