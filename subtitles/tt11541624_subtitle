00:04:37,383 --> 00:04:39,634
That's easy! Go and sit. You'll get
used to it before you head to the hospital.

55
00:04:39,635 --> 00:04:42,079
Whose lap would I fit in this situation?

56
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,311

This smell is nothing.

You'd feel the aroma when cooked with spices.

Begum is waiting for me.

You're active even now.

00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:50,288
Hey! Nothing like that.

81
00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:53,238
People come to me. I never lookout for anyone.

82
00:05:53,239 --> 00:05:54,991
Oh! Great, man.

Hanumanthu hasn't paid
me for the programme we did.

Didn't he give you?

Why haven't you paid the lady

You said you'd give her in person, didn't you?

00:10:56,016 --> 00:10:57,007
Hey, buddy.

185
00:10:57,255 --> 00:10:58,187
What are you doing, man?

186
00:10:58,188 --> 00:10:59,764
You're my savior. What are you up to?

187
00:10:59,811 --> 00:11:04,774
Did you earn well?
Why do you worry about money?

188
00:11:04,785 --> 00:11:05,931
Come! Let's booze.

189
00:11:06,058 --> 00:11:07,711
This isn't the right time to booze.

190
00:11:07,712 --> 00:11:09,173
Wait until evening. Why hurry?

191
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,614
Don't buy a full bottle.

192
00:11:11,627 --> 00:11:13,640
Buy something good enough for me.

193
00:11:13,719 --> 00:11:16,049
You can drink whatever you want
and return the remaining, buddy.

194
00:11:16,251 --> 00:11:17,554
I'm not an alcoholic, right?

195
00:11:17,555 --> 00:11:19,861
Is someone beside you? You talk crap!

196
00:11:20,654 --> 00:11:23,095
Kavitha is in the vehicle.

197
00:11:23,096 --> 00:11:23,876
Let's talk later.

198
00:11:23,887 --> 00:11:24,804
Gosh! She might strangle me.

199
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:26,157
Is it Siva Reddy?

200
00:11:26,158 --> 00:11:26,667
Yes.

201
00:11:26,668 --> 00:11:29,365
You won't save money to
pay auto loan every month.

202
00:11:29,376 --> 00:11:31,484
But, you waste money on alcohol every day.

203
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,668
I'm helpless, Kavi.

204
00:11:33,006 --> 00:11:34,811
I cannot stay put without alcohol.

205
00:11:34,851 --> 00:11:37,185
I can drive the auto if I'm not still.

206
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:37,975
Stop it.

207
00:11:41,438 --> 00:11:43,900
Buddy…Stop here.
Stop.

208
00:11:44,469 --> 00:11:45,957
Hey! Give me 90 ml.

209
00:11:48,837 --> 00:11:51,859
83…84…85!

210
00:11:53,603 --> 00:11:54,261
That's it?

211
00:11:54,272 --> 00:11:55,128
What is this, man?

212
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:56,366
I measured it correctly.

213
00:11:56,367 --> 00:11:59,078
Cheating someone at the
petrol bunk might be easy.

214
00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:01,255
But, no one can cheat a drunkard.

215
00:12:01,395 --> 00:12:03,589
Add 5 ml now!

216
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:05,049
Shut up and come.

217
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:08,254
Why do you fight for something hopeless?

218
00:12:08,265 --> 00:12:08,958
Come.

219
00:12:08,969 --> 00:12:10,812
You cannot get anything if you do not ask.

220
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:11,653
Get lost.

221
00:12:12,105 --> 00:12:12,993
Cheers!

222
00:12:20,587 --> 00:12:21,653
Shankar!

223
00:12:21,925 --> 00:12:24,170
How much do earn per day?
What?

224
00:12:24,584 --> 00:12:26,566
How much do you make from auto every day?

225
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:29,307
200? 300?

226
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:32,630
Maybe the highest you could make is 450.

227
00:12:32,631 --> 00:12:33,843
Am I right?

228
00:12:34,032 --> 00:12:34,581
Yeah.

229
00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:38,242
I pity you for the trouble you take every day.

230
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,142
Will you do something?

231
00:12:41,453 --> 00:12:42,909
Forget about auto and come with me.

232
00:12:42,977 --> 00:12:44,566
What should I do?

233
00:12:44,918 --> 00:12:47,330
Chap! I am not joking.

234
00:12:47,582 --> 00:12:49,256
I am telling you the truth.

235
00:12:49,752 --> 00:12:53,752
Do you know how much we
can make if we get double head?

236
00:12:53,993 --> 00:12:56,921
Our lives might change in a jiffy.

237
00:12:57,249 --> 00:12:59,386
How will it change instantly?

238
00:12:59,397 --> 00:13:00,362
This is suspicious.

239
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:01,597
Hey, bro! Come here.
Yes, Brother!

240
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:04,893
Refill our drinks and get
an omelet or fried snacks.

241
00:13:04,894 --> 00:13:06,573
Don't you dare burn the omelet!

242
00:13:06,871 --> 00:13:07,712
Tell me.

243
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,047
Listen to me carefully.

244
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:11,544
Double head means double-headed snake!

245
00:13:11,647 --> 00:13:13,720
We hit the jackpot if we find it.

246
00:13:13,806 --> 00:13:14,689
Double-headed snake?

247
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:15,050
Hmm.

248
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:15,733
Where can we find it?

249
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:18,782
Double-tongued people are plenty around us.

250
00:13:18,783 --> 00:13:20,127
Forget it.

251
00:13:20,316 --> 00:13:21,996
Have you heard of black flowers?

252
00:13:22,171 --> 00:13:23,478
Do you know its price?

253
00:13:23,587 --> 00:13:28,480
Not just dust and gust,
we can break through lockers with it.

254
00:13:28,961 --> 00:13:31,971
I want you to join me and we can
settle by doing something like that.

255
00:13:32,198 --> 00:13:36,149
All you like to do is
changing gears and honking.

256
00:13:36,439 --> 00:13:38,218
How much is 1-liter Kerosene?

257
00:13:38,229 --> 00:13:40,340
I am not sure.
50 or 100 rupees I guess. But, why?

258
00:13:40,435 --> 00:13:43,307
I'll get it to scorch this shop.

259
00:13:43,705 --> 00:13:47,067
Hey, idiot! The owner would
smash you if he hears what you said.

260
00:13:47,603 --> 00:13:49,100
Oh no! I forgot.

261
00:13:49,658 --> 00:13:52,332
Everything would get destroyed, right?

262
00:13:59,423 --> 00:13:59,941
Come.

263
00:14:00,533 --> 00:14:01,525
Okay, let's go.

264
00:14:01,904 --> 00:14:03,813
Hey…
What's with you?

265
00:14:03,862 --> 00:14:05,647
Is it a new route or what?

266
00:14:06,673 --> 00:14:07,088
Hey.

267
00:14:07,967 --> 00:14:08,626
Hey!

268
00:14:08,627 --> 00:14:10,657
I drive you every day.
Can't you take me just one day?

269
00:14:10,888 --> 00:14:11,493
Hey.

270
00:14:12,165 --> 00:14:13,016
Control!

271
00:14:16,812 --> 00:14:18,891
Why did you stop without me hitting the brake?

272
00:14:20,282 --> 00:14:21,803
What happened to you?

273
00:14:23,332 --> 00:14:25,044
Is everything okay?

274
00:14:29,054 --> 00:14:30,733
All is well!

275
00:14:32,308 --> 00:14:35,072
Why did my auto stop automatically?

276
00:14:35,212 --> 00:14:38,296
'Venkanna's daughter died of suicide.'

277
00:14:38,297 --> 00:14:41,458
'Ghost plays with everyone it seems.'

278
00:14:43,094 --> 00:14:45,848
I have to head home soon
before I become sober.

279
00:14:47,782 --> 00:14:48,545
Move ahead.

280
00:14:49,993 --> 00:14:50,557
Steady!

281
00:14:52,469 --> 00:14:53,807
Hold on!

282
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:54,703
Hold on!

283
00:14:54,714 --> 00:14:55,581
Stop!

284
00:14:55,963 --> 00:14:56,789
Close your eyes!

285
00:14:56,945 --> 00:14:58,174
Well done!

[SINGING]

287
00:15:05,629 --> 00:15:07,321
Did I just hear something?

288
00:15:12,747 --> 00:15:16,445
What's with you?
Is it a new route or what?

289
00:15:17,599 --> 00:15:19,318
Did you stop my auto earlier?

290
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:22,716
I was totally worried.

291
00:15:23,387 --> 00:15:25,022
How did you get into my auto?

292
00:15:25,462 --> 00:15:28,346
You're tiny. But, you threatened me.

293
00:15:28,362 --> 00:15:29,872
What will you do here anyway?

294
00:15:30,119 --> 00:15:31,529
Let's get in. Come.

295
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:33,485
Come…Come!

296
00:15:33,946 --> 00:15:35,675
Come, my dear.

297
00:15:35,762 --> 00:15:37,308
Come.

298
00:15:38,576 --> 00:15:40,433
This is my house.

299
00:15:41,606 --> 00:15:42,793
Silence!

300
00:15:45,005 --> 00:15:46,222
Does it stink?

301
00:15:46,726 --> 00:15:47,820
No, right?

302
00:15:49,725 --> 00:15:53,791
My wife would drive me out
if she finds I'm badly drunk.

303
00:15:55,615 --> 00:15:59,126
I'll take you inside if you stay
silent without making noise.

304
00:15:59,137 --> 00:15:59,687
Okay?

305
00:16:00,817 --> 00:16:02,045
Hush!

306
00:16:02,225 --> 00:16:04,814
Will you have a drink?

307
00:16:04,825 --> 00:16:05,592
No!

308
00:16:05,929 --> 00:16:07,815
Hey! You should have milk.

309
00:16:07,937 --> 00:16:09,040
I should have alcohol.

310
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,277
Let me have it.

311
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:14,755
By the way, are you a boy or a girl?

312
00:16:14,994 --> 00:16:16,833
Don't say. Let me find it.
Wait…

313
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,474
You're a boy.

314
00:16:20,778 --> 00:16:23,410
Let me tell you something interesting.

315
00:16:23,522 --> 00:16:26,593
Drinking is injurious to health.

316
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:35,006
Where did you get it?

317
00:16:35,613 --> 00:16:37,609
I am already sustaining your drinking habit.

318
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,431
Is it an add-on?

319
00:16:39,526 --> 00:16:42,434
Send it away. Eat and sleep.

320
00:16:42,767 --> 00:16:43,703
Kavi.

321
00:16:43,845 --> 00:16:44,702
Kavi.

322
00:16:44,861 --> 00:16:45,830
Kavitha!

323
00:16:46,309 --> 00:16:48,414
She's always like that.

324
00:16:48,479 --> 00:16:49,470
She is short-tempered.

325
00:16:49,528 --> 00:16:52,028
But, she's a lovely lady.

Come to me.

328
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:09,511
Sleep…

329
00:17:09,584 --> 00:17:11,336
What shampoo do you use?

330
00:17:11,871 --> 00:17:13,360
You're so soft.

331
00:17:14,228 --> 00:17:16,960
Look at my hair. It is rough and messy.

332
00:17:18,169 --> 00:17:20,590
Where are you from?

333
00:17:23,028 --> 00:17:26,451
Why are roaming on the streets at night?
Did you come to meet your friends?

334
00:17:26,606 --> 00:17:27,252
Huh?

335
00:17:28,372 --> 00:17:30,030
Did you run away from home?

336
00:17:31,141 --> 00:17:32,614
Where are your parents?

337
00:17:34,037 --> 00:17:35,486
Did you do something wrong?

338
00:17:37,536 --> 00:17:40,482
Hey!
Are you afraid your father might hurt you?

339
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:43,974
Hey! Parents taunt us always.

340
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,341
Why did you run away just because of that?

341
00:17:48,074 --> 00:17:50,980
I did something like this when I was a kid.

342
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:53,964
I ate and slept at the bus stand.

343
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:59,674
Sometimes it brings a smile on my face.

344
00:18:01,161 --> 00:18:05,739
Sometimes, I feel like going home.

345
00:18:06,847 --> 00:18:08,577
What's there to do even if I go?

346
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:15,364
I lost my parents.

347
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:20,141
Hey! Are you crying?

348
00:18:20,152 --> 00:18:23,798
Oh, my dear! Stop crying.

349
00:18:24,456 --> 00:18:26,776
Everyone is an orphan here.

350
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:29,690
I am an orphan. You're an orphan.

351
00:18:29,796 --> 00:18:31,446
Everyone is an orphan.

352
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,123
Hey, Kavi. Give me some coffee.

353
00:18:49,124 --> 00:18:50,343
My head reels!

354
00:18:50,503 --> 00:18:52,502
You booze too much at night.

355
00:18:52,705 --> 00:18:54,586
You'll have a headache in the morning.

356
00:18:54,872 --> 00:18:57,237
Why do get angry just for one coffee?

357
00:18:57,238 --> 00:18:58,708
Am I taunting you?

358
00:18:58,893 --> 00:19:02,812
You were hard to handle.
Now, you've got a buddy too.

359

A buddy?

360
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:05,957
Who is my new buddy?

361
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:09,480
I've seen people talking
to themselves while drunk.

362
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:12,174
You were the one talking to animals.

363
00:19:12,175 --> 00:19:13,331
You don't have any sense, do you?

364
00:19:13,332 --> 00:19:14,576
What are you talking about?

365
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:16,986
Who came to our house?

You reach home tripping!

368
00:19:22,074 --> 00:19:23,671
Come and see this.

369
00:19:25,997 --> 00:19:28,788
I might have puked last night.

370
00:19:28,789 --> 00:19:30,049
Why haven't you cleaned it?

371
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,130
It is our living room.

372
00:19:31,141 --> 00:19:31,621
Yuck!

373
00:19:31,925 --> 00:19:33,045
It is not you!

374
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:34,749
That puppy did this.

375
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,982
He did it.

376
00:19:36,005 --> 00:19:36,735
My bad!

377
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:38,369
Puppy?

378
00:19:39,337 --> 00:19:41,514
I am unable to handle you.

379
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:43,392
How can I handle a puppy too?

380
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,579
Get me coffee soon.

381
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:45,802
Gosh!

382
00:19:46,201 --> 00:19:48,955
Were you talking about this pup?

383
00:19:49,037 --> 00:19:51,009
It slept in the house I guess.

384
00:19:51,676 --> 00:19:53,271
Not in the house.

385
00:19:53,282 --> 00:19:55,147
It slept on you all night.

386
00:19:55,513 --> 00:19:58,991
You gave your wife's place to a pup.

387
00:19:59,002 --> 00:20:00,636
Shucks! Some people never change.

388
00:20:00,637 --> 00:20:02,725
Were you the one I spoke to all night?

389
00:20:02,736 --> 00:20:03,801
We had a good talk, didn't we?

390
00:20:03,812 --> 00:20:05,493
Hey! Get some food for the puppy.

391
00:20:06,811 --> 00:20:08,587
I am taking care of you already.

392
00:20:08,598 --> 00:20:09,714
Why should I do it for him?

393
00:20:09,802 --> 00:20:11,380
Send it away immediately.

394
00:20:11,721 --> 00:20:13,080
I don't have time for this.

395
00:20:13,091 --> 00:20:14,847
I can't do that work.

396
00:20:15,121 --> 00:20:16,394
Why are you hitting me? Wait!

397
00:20:17,353 --> 00:20:19,496
Okay, come.

398
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:22,690
I cannot live in peace if you stay here.

399
00:20:22,701 --> 00:20:24,042
So, I'll take you out.

400
00:20:25,065 --> 00:20:26,130
Are you hungry?

401
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:28,564
Shankar! Did you come with a puppy?

402
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:33,042
I did not get it.
It somehow got into my auto last night.

403
00:20:33,473 --> 00:20:35,277
How sad! What happened next?

404
00:20:35,278 --> 00:20:37,919
What else? I thought it left.

405
00:20:37,968 --> 00:20:40,808
Later I realized it came home with me.

406
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,998
Kavitha has been scolding
me ever since she saw this.

407
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:46,719
She would've been happy if she had kids.

408
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,746
You think about raising
a puppy instead of that.

409
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,250
Why wouldn't she get angry?

410
00:20:50,261 --> 00:20:54,004
Some people make things
even harder for others.

411
00:20:54,005 --> 00:20:55,184
Someone like you!

412
00:20:56,785 --> 00:20:59,278
Shankar! Get married isn't enough.

413
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:02,082
You should make your wife happy.

414
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,271
You are not thinking about that.

415
00:21:03,344 --> 00:21:05,576
Forget it! Feed the puppy first.

416
00:21:05,587 --> 00:21:08,127
I know what to do.
You focus on making tasty tea.

417
00:21:08,138 --> 00:21:09,926
Go… Work on it.

418
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,226
Let's go.

419
00:21:11,684 --> 00:21:14,190
[RADIO PLAYING]

420
00:21:48,542 --> 00:21:50,681
You promised to send it away.

421
00:21:50,743 --> 00:21:52,154
Why did you bring him back?

422
00:21:52,212 --> 00:21:53,377
Are you out of your senses?

423
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:55,188
Hey! I left it at the tea stall.

424
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:56,438
What can I do if it comes back?

425
00:21:56,439 --> 00:21:58,202
You start taunting early in the morning.

426
00:21:58,273 --> 00:21:59,967
Stop talking nonsense.

427
00:22:00,074 --> 00:22:01,903
It is right here.

428
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:04,470
Leave it somewhere far away.

429
00:22:05,034 --> 00:22:05,867
Oh no!

430
00:22:05,878 --> 00:22:07,682
You'd see my reaction later if you fail.

431
00:22:08,885 --> 00:22:09,649
You go.

432
00:22:28,707 --> 00:22:32,370
"You can never rid of a few things"

433
00:22:32,542 --> 00:22:36,010
“You can't get everything you deserve”

434
00:22:36,148 --> 00:22:39,875
“You have to face such things due to ill fate”

435
00:22:39,926 --> 00:22:43,657
“You'd never leave it once you get attached”

436
00:22:47,097 --> 00:22:50,917
“Oh no no…O' God…”

437
00:22:51,042 --> 00:22:54,509
“What's this fuss?”

438
00:22:54,602 --> 00:22:58,315
“I was happy with my life”

439
00:22:58,414 --> 00:23:01,775
“Don't ruin my life by being a part”

440
00:23:01,786 --> 00:23:05,205
“I plead you to leave me”

441
00:23:05,311 --> 00:23:09,007
"My wife ill-treats me if you stay home"

442
00:23:09,026 --> 00:23:12,754
“Stop troubling me by following”

443
00:23:12,769 --> 00:23:16,721
“I am just an auto man”

444
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:20,383
“Your life was your choice”

445
00:23:20,449 --> 00:23:24,228
"But, you've got trouble now"

446
00:23:49,256 --> 00:23:50,085
Stop here.

447
00:23:50,851 --> 00:23:52,835
Why did you leave this puppy there, brother?

448
00:23:57,319 --> 00:23:58,728
You'd understand once you get married.

449
00:24:07,498 --> 00:24:08,595
Hey, buddy!

450
00:24:08,897 --> 00:24:10,373
Bad timing!

451
00:24:10,374 --> 00:24:10,952
What is it, man?

452
00:24:10,953 --> 00:24:13,756
Did you plan to buy a plot here?

453
00:24:13,757 --> 00:24:15,403
There's nothing like that.

454
00:24:15,404 --> 00:24:16,731
This puppy came into my life.

455
00:24:16,732 --> 00:24:18,217
It comes back even
after trying to get rid of it.

456
00:24:18,228 --> 00:24:20,451
I covered his eyes and came to leave it here.

457
00:24:20,827 --> 00:24:22,620
Are you even human?

458
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:25,444
How can you leave that puppy here?

459
00:24:28,725 --> 00:24:32,281
People who don't have
kids raise such pups as kids.

460
00:24:32,527 --> 00:24:34,411
You are trying to get rid of it.

461
00:24:35,216 --> 00:24:37,836
It might die if a vehicle hits it.

462
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:40,208
Give it to someone ready to adopt it.

463
00:24:40,209 --> 00:24:41,503
He can play with them happily.

464
00:24:42,374 --> 00:24:46,309
Will you leave your baby like this?

465
00:24:50,397 --> 00:24:51,893
Are you hungry?

466
00:24:52,944 --> 00:24:53,998
Give it to me.

467
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:55,969
You touched it without washing your hands.

468
00:24:56,615 --> 00:24:57,880
Strange attitude, man!

469
00:24:58,015 --> 00:24:59,745
I'll meet you at our spot in the evening.

470
00:25:06,757 --> 00:25:07,848
Sit…

471
00:25:09,233 --> 00:25:10,784
What should I do about you?

472
00:25:11,522 --> 00:25:13,445
Time will decide everything!

473
00:25:14,803 --> 00:25:16,329
You don't know about these people.

474
00:25:17,032 --> 00:25:18,844
They do anything for money.

475
00:25:18,889 --> 00:25:21,327
They might sell you to
someone if they find you alone.

476
00:25:21,338 --> 00:25:22,628
Such bad people still exist.

477
00:25:33,037 --> 00:25:35,893
I want to treat you like my friend.

478
00:25:36,281 --> 00:25:37,532
He's a good guy.

479
00:25:38,074 --> 00:25:39,323
He's my childhood friend.

480
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:42,087
He loves me so much.

481
00:25:42,812 --> 00:25:44,145
He died suddenly.

482
00:25:45,348 --> 00:25:47,989
I should name you after him.

483
00:25:48,734 --> 00:25:49,638
I'll do it.

484
00:25:49,649 --> 00:25:50,755
Gundu!

485
00:25:51,682 --> 00:25:54,708
Gundu is a perfect name for you.

486
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,250
You're a karate king!

488
00:25:59,484 --> 00:26:00,881
No? Okay!

489
00:26:01,976 --> 00:26:04,016

Let's go.

00:26:05,881 --> 00:26:09,001
Hey! Your mother is angry with you.

492
00:26:09,097 --> 00:26:12,141
Stay calm even if scolds you. Get it?

493
00:26:12,152 --> 00:26:13,497
We're drunk now.

494
00:26:13,889 --> 00:26:14,991
I asked you to get rid of it.

495
00:26:15,002 --> 00:26:17,044
Why did you bring it back?

496
00:26:17,045 --> 00:26:17,625
Hush!

497
00:26:18,358 --> 00:26:19,311
Hey! Stay calm.

498
00:26:20,569 --> 00:26:21,677
Haven't I told you?

499
00:26:22,287 --> 00:26:22,901
Come.

500
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:27,220
People like you will never understand.

501
00:26:27,912 --> 00:26:29,500
Do, as you like.

502
00:26:29,842 --> 00:26:31,739
Give something for us to eat.

503
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,696
We shall perish later.

504
00:26:32,744 --> 00:26:33,683
I cooked.

505
00:26:33,723 --> 00:26:34,925
It is over there. Go and eat.

506
00:26:35,403 --> 00:26:37,562
Otherwise, starve!

507
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,251
Hey, Kavi.

508
00:26:41,747 --> 00:26:44,627
Usually, it is better to perish far from home.

509
00:26:44,842 --> 00:26:48,111
My wife wants me dead here.

510
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:49,699
Gosh!

511
00:26:50,227 --> 00:26:51,435
Sit here.

512
00:26:51,909 --> 00:26:53,683
I'll get something to eat.

00:26:53,777 --> 00:26:55,634

No one would question us.

00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:07,193
Let people talk!

518
00:27:07,204 --> 00:27:10,114
Let us not bother, my dear brother.

519
00:27:10,125 --> 00:27:11,068
I'll say it once we finish eating!

520
00:27:13,717 --> 00:27:14,600
Wait! I'll feed you.

521
00:27:15,854 --> 00:27:17,719
Here. Eat…

524
00:28:57,643 --> 00:29:00,112
Why did they come to this old bungalow?

525
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:03,113
That couple came for a shoot.

526
00:29:03,124 --> 00:29:04,212
A shoot before the wedding?

527
00:29:04,277 --> 00:29:05,442
It's a photoshoot.

528
00:29:05,701 --> 00:29:07,170
That was my question.

529
00:29:07,181 --> 00:29:08,834
What's special about the shoot?

530
00:29:08,893 --> 00:29:09,808
Will they screen it in theatres?

531
00:29:09,819 --> 00:29:12,159
No! It is the latest trend.

532
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,308
They call it a pre-wedding shoot.

533
00:29:13,309 --> 00:29:15,150
They take pictures before the wedding.

534
00:29:15,151 --> 00:29:17,647
They make a video and
publish their wedding card.

535
00:29:17,648 --> 00:29:18,763
Oh!

536
00:29:23,089 --> 00:29:24,607
It is a love story!

537
00:29:25,052 --> 00:29:27,061
They love each other.

538
00:29:27,161 --> 00:29:30,102
Their parents agreed for their wedding,
unlike others.

539
00:29:30,113 --> 00:29:31,813
Why should they do this anyway?

540
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:35,005
Just because no one likes you,
why do you envy them?

541
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,870
I am thinking about it.

542
00:29:36,934 --> 00:29:38,860
My love story won't be that simple.

543
00:29:38,964 --> 00:29:39,457
Is it?

544
00:29:39,471 --> 00:29:41,156
I have a different scope.

00:29:41,167 --> 00:29:41,780
That's true!

546
00:29:41,781 --> 00:29:44,244
Your range is different.
You'd find a rich one.

547
00:29:44,245 --> 00:29:45,691
You are right.

548
00:29:45,692 --> 00:29:49,090
It that really happens,
my life would settle within a couple of days.

549
00:29:49,144 --> 00:29:52,490
I'll gain her trust and escape with her money.

00:29:52,491 --> 00:29:53,524
Shut up, idiot.

00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,020
Look there.

552
00:30:01,589 --> 00:30:04,062
Sir! Can you give your puppy for 5 minutes?

553
00:30:04,063 --> 00:30:05,634
How much will you pay for 5 minutes?

554
00:30:05,715 --> 00:30:07,669
Tell me what you expect. I shall give.

555
00:30:08,341 --> 00:30:08,950
Come.

556
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,141
Let's get a photoshoot.

557
00:30:12,161 --> 00:30:12,883
Come.

558
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:14,147
Take him.
Come.

559
00:30:14,954 --> 00:30:16,377
Don't worry. He's a friendly dog.

560
00:30:18,006 --> 00:30:19,128
He's a good boy!

561
00:30:26,263 --> 00:30:27,404
They're clicking good pictures, right.

562
00:30:27,694 --> 00:30:31,285
Excuse me. Why did you abandon this?
Take a few pictures here.

563
00:30:31,402 --> 00:30:32,903
That's a good idea, sir.
Really?

564
00:30:32,974 --> 00:30:33,807
Idiot!

565
00:30:38,019 --> 00:30:39,909
Sir, come.
I'll click a picture for you and Gundu!

566
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:40,950
Me?
Yes, sir.

567
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,125
Come, Gundu!

568
00:30:42,136 --> 00:30:43,743
Buddy! I'll join you.

569
00:30:43,744 --> 00:30:44,817
Get lost.

570
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,472
Am I not good for a snap?

571
00:31:00,136 --> 00:31:01,634
Hey! What happened to you?

572
00:31:05,323 --> 00:31:06,621
Do you have a fever?

573
00:31:12,019 --> 00:31:14,180
Don't worry.
He'll be fine once I give this injection.

574
00:31:32,005 --> 00:31:35,070
Gosh! I need to pee immediately.

575
00:31:35,173 --> 00:31:36,961
Stay here.
Stay here.

576
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,099
Hey! Stay there.

577
00:31:46,714 --> 00:31:49,494
I'm feeling good now.

578
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:50,923
Gundu!

579
00:31:52,964 --> 00:31:53,817
Hey, Gundu!

580
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:55,842
Gundu!

581
00:31:56,972 --> 00:31:57,991
Where did you go?

582
00:31:59,144 --> 00:31:59,910
Gundu!

583
00:32:00,496 --> 00:32:02,045
[WHISTLES]

584
00:32:02,526 --> 00:32:03,271
Gundu!

585
00:32:03,493 --> 00:32:04,302
Hey, Gundu!

586
00:32:06,738 --> 00:32:08,792
Hey! What are you doing here?

587
00:32:09,016 --> 00:32:10,153
Did you come to pee or poop?

588
00:32:17,324 --> 00:32:19,792
This dog is missing.

589
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,600
His name is Simbha.

590
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:25,214
Oh! I thought you didn't have a name.
Is your name Simbha?

591
00:32:25,225 --> 00:32:26,698
So, you're missing!

592
00:32:27,016 --> 00:32:29,722
You agreed when I said we're orphans,
didn't you?

593
00:32:30,722 --> 00:32:33,426
Did you fight with your parents?

594
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:35,650
Will you go back?

595
00:32:35,812 --> 00:32:36,779
Shall I make a call?

596
00:32:37,625 --> 00:32:38,710
Go home.

597
00:32:40,433 --> 00:32:41,828
Okay…

598
00:32:41,829 --> 00:32:43,102
I understood.

599
00:32:43,415 --> 00:32:44,313
Give me a minute.

600
00:32:55,488 --> 00:32:56,993
Nothing will happen to you. Let's go.

601
00:32:59,909 --> 00:33:01,702
The sticker is here too.

602
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:02,974
Let's remove it.

603
00:33:10,452 --> 00:33:11,246
What is it, dear?

604
00:33:12,605 --> 00:33:14,135
You don't want to leave me, right?

605
00:33:15,792 --> 00:33:18,023
I cannot live without you.
I was just kidding.

606
00:33:22,315 --> 00:33:24,734
No one bothers such stickers.

607
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:26,573
Many people go missing.

608
00:33:27,004 --> 00:33:28,877
No one can separate you from me.

609
00:33:28,916 --> 00:33:30,707
Don't worry. You can stay with me.

610
00:33:34,972 --> 00:33:36,874
There he is.

611
00:33:38,161 --> 00:33:39,098
He's home.

612
00:33:39,169 --> 00:33:42,233
Hubby! It seems this puppy belongs to them.

613
00:33:42,244 --> 00:33:43,594
I called them.

614
00:33:43,622 --> 00:33:45,503
His missing posters are everywhere.

615
00:33:45,514 --> 00:33:46,568
So sad!
Give it to me, sir.

616
00:33:46,612 --> 00:33:49,034
It seems they are missing it
a lot and weren't eating well.

617
00:33:49,035 --> 00:33:49,849
Simbha!

618
00:33:49,884 --> 00:33:51,681
We searched for you everywhere.

619
00:33:51,914 --> 00:33:53,688
Talk to Simbha, dear.

620
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:57,312
Madam! Let it stay with me.

621
00:33:57,805 --> 00:33:59,265
I will take care of it.

622
00:33:59,687 --> 00:34:02,153
We both got close.

623
00:34:02,784 --> 00:34:05,481
Why would they give us their pet, hubby?

624
00:34:05,524 --> 00:34:07,456
They treat him like a kid.

625
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,251
So sad! That girl missed him so much.

626
00:34:11,252 --> 00:34:12,103
Shut up!

627
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:15,491
Think about it, madam. - What, man?
What the hell are you talking?

628
00:34:15,516 --> 00:34:17,747
It won't be nice if you say that.
Simbha belongs to us.

629
00:34:17,893 --> 00:34:19,134
We're taking him back.

630
00:34:19,749 --> 00:34:21,816
Hey! Stop talking.

631
00:34:21,817 --> 00:34:23,833
I'll file a case on you
that you robbed their pet.

632
00:34:24,816 --> 00:34:25,629
Move!

633
00:34:26,652 --> 00:34:28,991
Madam! Is it your dog? - Yes.

634
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:30,176
Are you sure? - Yes, sir.

635
00:34:30,177 --> 00:34:30,854
Take it with you.

636
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,212
Let's go.

637
00:34:36,433 --> 00:34:37,220
Gundu!

638
00:34:42,707 --> 00:34:46,369
Hubby! I made sweet. Will you have it?

639
00:34:46,397 --> 00:34:48,973
You enjoy! Get inside.

640
00:34:49,038 --> 00:34:50,368
Sweet it seems!

641
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:52,201
My Gundu is gone!

642
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:54,437
Gundu!

643
00:35:10,582 --> 00:35:11,633
Hubby.

644
00:35:12,344 --> 00:35:13,085
Hubby.

645
00:35:13,085 --> 00:35:13,574
Get up!

646
00:35:13,585 --> 00:35:14,268
What happened?

647
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:15,309
Loaners are here.

648
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:25,759
Auto Shankar!
I haven't seen you at the office for 3 months.

649
00:35:26,263 --> 00:35:28,184
I planned to come after 2-3 days, sir.

650
00:35:28,463 --> 00:35:29,603
You came here before I did.

651
00:35:30,511 --> 00:35:31,139
Come.

652
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,684
You've learned things, huh!

653
00:35:33,272 --> 00:35:35,480
You do not respond to my calls.
You disappeared!

654
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,969
But, I don't have a choice.

655
00:35:37,003 --> 00:35:38,581
I came searching for you.

656
00:35:38,592 --> 00:35:39,714
Nothing like you think, sir.

657
00:35:40,007 --> 00:35:42,528
I didn't have much savings.

658
00:35:42,699 --> 00:35:44,184
I got my auto repaired recently.

659
00:35:44,816 --> 00:35:46,374
I don't have money now.

660
00:35:46,375 --> 00:35:47,751
Why do you need an auto, then?

661
00:35:48,311 --> 00:35:50,362
I shall auction the auto.

662
00:35:50,363 --> 00:35:53,042
Both of us should be fine then. - Sir.

663
00:35:53,083 --> 00:35:55,249
Hey! Get this vehicle to our office.
Sir.

664
00:35:55,861 --> 00:35:56,948
Don't talk like that.

665
00:35:57,094 --> 00:35:58,778
I'll come and talk to your boss.

666
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:00,027
Don't take the auto.

667
00:36:00,028 --> 00:36:02,789
Why would we come here
if you come to the office?

668
00:36:03,219 --> 00:36:06,228
Okay. We shall wait for a week.
Later, your vehicle shall be seized.

669
00:36:17,027 --> 00:36:19,280
Hubby! Breakfast!
Hubby!

670
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,217
Auto…

671
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:24,138
Where should you go?

672
00:36:24,149 --> 00:36:25,496
Old bus stand!

673
00:36:28,628 --> 00:36:29,483
Stop here.

674
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:31,200
How much is it?

675
00:36:32,282 --> 00:36:33,411
40 rupees.

676
00:36:35,466 --> 00:36:36,088
Take this.

677
00:36:36,089 --> 00:36:37,369
40 rupees it is! Give me change.

678
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,949
I don't have change.
You should give me the change.

679
00:36:43,722 --> 00:36:44,960
Here! Count it.

680
00:36:45,553 --> 00:36:46,461
What's this?

681
00:36:46,511 --> 00:36:48,418
Why did you give me 50 paisa coins?

682
00:36:48,419 --> 00:36:49,652
No one accepts them.

683
00:36:49,653 --> 00:36:50,538
What should I do with it?

684
00:36:50,754 --> 00:36:52,650
Take this back and give me a note.

685
00:36:52,715 --> 00:36:55,312
What happened now? You cannot
cheat me like you cheat everyone else.

686
00:36:55,323 --> 00:36:55,722
Give it.

687
00:36:55,787 --> 00:36:57,478
Why would I cheat, madam?

688
00:36:57,489 --> 00:36:58,687
I give whatever I have.

689
00:36:58,779 --> 00:37:00,460
How will I get you notes?

690
00:37:00,564 --> 00:37:03,148
Why do you drive an auto
without carrying some change?

691
00:37:03,235 --> 00:37:06,253
I understood what you are
when you gave worthless coins.

692
00:37:06,264 --> 00:37:08,393
You wait for innocent people like me to cheat.

693
00:37:08,394 --> 00:37:09,161
Give me the money.

694
00:37:09,162 --> 00:37:11,076
Stop talking like that.

695
00:37:11,077 --> 00:37:12,877
Give me money if you have it.
Otherwise, leave it.

696
00:37:12,878 --> 00:37:14,545
I shall consider it a charity.

697
00:37:14,546 --> 00:37:15,706
Stop talking like that.

698
00:37:15,707 --> 00:37:17,528
How can you expect me to stay calm?

699
00:37:18,189 --> 00:37:20,413
Are you my father?

700
00:37:20,588 --> 00:37:21,861
I don't need your alms.

701
00:37:22,069 --> 00:37:24,333
I help a lot of people with charity.

702
00:37:24,532 --> 00:37:25,542
Why do you think of yourself?

703
00:37:25,614 --> 00:37:28,912
You and your auto would vanish
if my husband finds out about this.

704
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,135
Be careful with your choice of words.

705
00:37:30,335 --> 00:37:32,423
Take your money back.

706
00:37:32,424 --> 00:37:33,562
Good riddance!

707
00:37:33,563 --> 00:37:34,932
Unlucky start! Shucks!

708
00:37:36,823 --> 00:37:38,000
Get lost…

709
00:37:38,139 --> 00:37:39,725
I don't need your money.

710
00:37:39,803 --> 00:37:41,973
You've got self-esteem
and I have it more than you.

711
00:37:41,984 --> 00:37:42,521
Shucks!

712
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:51,770
Hey!

713
00:38:11,621 --> 00:38:12,778
Damn!

714
00:38:37,994 --> 00:38:38,901
What happened to you!

715
00:38:39,041 --> 00:38:40,752
He left me yesterday.

716
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,799
Now, you're not working.

717
00:38:42,841 --> 00:38:44,518
Will you leave me too?

718
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:50,192
Oh! Is it because I lied to the financer?

719
00:38:50,383 --> 00:38:51,580
What else should I do?

720
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:53,039
I am poor.

721
00:38:53,168 --> 00:38:54,439
I have desires.

722
00:38:54,808 --> 00:38:56,068
I am scared too.

723
00:38:56,949 --> 00:38:57,908
But, life should go on.

724
00:38:59,096 --> 00:39:02,631
Truth sounds like a lie when
heard from a low-class fellow.

725
00:39:05,925 --> 00:39:09,648
God shall do something.

726
00:39:12,533 --> 00:39:14,576
It was my mistake to finance for you.

727
00:39:15,295 --> 00:39:17,087
What else should I do to make living?

728
00:39:20,103 --> 00:39:23,742
How should my wife and
I live if you stop like this?

729
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:55,782
Give me tea, brother.

730
00:39:58,171 --> 00:39:59,126
Chap! Take this.

731
00:40:01,296 --> 00:40:02,315
Sir! How are you?

732
00:40:03,056 --> 00:40:04,177
We came to see you.

733
00:40:04,188 --> 00:40:06,180

01:01:48,713 --> 01:01:50,946
Nothing happened to me, dear.

1101
01:02:01,429 --> 01:02:04,255
[MUSIC]

1102
01:03:23,416 --> 01:03:25,929
Why did your mother decorate the house?

1103
01:03:28,653 --> 01:03:29,182
Come.

1104
01:03:29,662 --> 01:03:31,386
You've come home like sober after a long time.

1105
01:03:32,734 --> 01:03:35,319
What's this! No one can ever predict women.

1106
01:03:35,672 --> 01:03:39,118
Even a husband doesn't understand his wife.

1107
01:03:39,304 --> 01:03:41,829
That's why they say that
women are hard to guess.

1108
01:03:44,063 --> 01:03:45,030
Is it?

1109
01:03:46,398 --> 01:03:48,062
Shall I speak my heart out for you?

1110
01:03:49,702 --> 01:03:53,590
Looking at you reminds me of our wedding.

1111
01:03:54,558 --> 01:03:56,838
I want to see you like this always.

1112
01:03:57,839 --> 01:04:02,030
It has been so long I've seen you happy.

1113
01:04:03,281 --> 01:04:06,987
Your cheeks blush and lips shine.

1114
01:04:07,684 --> 01:04:10,124
I want to kiss you.

1115
01:04:11,664 --> 01:04:15,815
Stop it.
You might start talking about my beauty.

1116
01:04:16,535 --> 01:04:18,392
Take bath and come.

1117
01:04:18,403 --> 01:04:20,320
I'll prepare dinner for you.

1118
01:04:20,331 --> 01:04:21,680
Why should I take a bath now?

1119
01:04:22,276 --> 01:04:27,605
Let's continue this mood
without any more delay.

1120
01:04:27,606 --> 01:04:29,008
First, you go.

1121
01:04:29,448 --> 01:04:30,726
Take bath and come.

1122
01:04:30,737 --> 01:04:32,002
Let's do this later.

1123
01:04:32,003 --> 01:04:33,818
Leave me.

1124
01:04:34,368 --> 01:04:35,660
Damn!

1125
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:38,312
Kavi.
Go!

1126
01:04:38,313 --> 01:04:39,064
Hey!

1127
01:04:43,078 --> 01:04:44,282
Oh no!

1128
01:04:48,179 --> 01:04:50,281
The electricity guy understood our needs.

1129
01:04:50,793 --> 01:04:52,217
Hey, Kavi!

1130
01:05:07,637 --> 01:05:08,541
Hey, Kavi!

1131
01:05:09,389 --> 01:05:12,941
You're lovely today.

1132
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:18,294
I understood that you've got expectations
when you asked me to come early.

1133
01:05:18,305 --> 01:05:20,492
Why? Don't we have desires?

1134
01:05:21,325 --> 01:05:23,164
Shall we fulfill them?

1135
01:05:25,731 --> 01:05:32,770
Finally,
I somehow feel that its time for the baby.

1136
01:05:33,544 --> 01:05:38,442
Our baby girl should roam
around the house with anklets.

1137
01:05:38,443 --> 01:05:43,309
I want to hear her call my mother.
It makes me so happy.

1138
01:05:43,461 --> 01:05:48,349
She should grow up and
attend school in our auto.

1139
01:05:48,492 --> 01:05:50,386
Doesn't it feel good? - Yeah!

1140
01:05:50,397 --> 01:05:55,055
Just thinking about it makes me happy.

1141
01:05:55,767 --> 01:06:01,931
I know that it makes you happy too.

1142
01:06:03,421 --> 01:06:08,098
I understood that you raised that
dog because we didn't have kids.

1143
01:06:09,221 --> 01:06:14,637
Once we have our baby,
you'll love her so much.

1144
01:06:15,604 --> 01:06:18,292
Slowly, you might forget that dog.

1145
01:06:18,923 --> 01:06:20,196
Is it true?

1146
01:06:30,366 --> 01:06:31,178
Oh no!

1147
01:06:36,014 --> 01:06:37,002
What happened?

1148
01:06:37,849 --> 01:06:39,177
What are you thinking about?

1149
01:06:39,609 --> 01:06:41,266
Did I say something wrong?

1150
01:06:44,146 --> 01:06:44,920
Hubby!

1151
01:06:53,366 --> 01:06:54,151
Hubby!

1152
01:06:54,397 --> 01:06:55,223
Gundu!

1153
01:06:57,569 --> 01:06:58,881
What happened to you, hubby?

1154
01:07:00,030 --> 01:07:01,350
Don't you want to have kids?

1155
01:07:02,561 --> 01:07:04,302
What are you thinking?

1156
01:07:05,358 --> 01:07:06,234
Tell me.

1157
01:07:06,563 --> 01:07:07,785
Shouldn't we have kids?

1158
01:07:08,428 --> 01:07:09,571
No, dear.

1159
01:07:10,467 --> 01:07:13,074
I've been to many temples.

1160
01:07:13,125 --> 01:07:14,867
I prayed to every God!

1161
01:07:15,097 --> 01:07:16,899
You're not at all worried.

1162
01:07:18,291 --> 01:07:20,869
Oh! I understood it very well now.

1163
01:07:21,378 --> 01:07:24,907
That dog is important for you than me.

1164
01:07:25,571 --> 01:07:27,347
I don't like it but let me ask you something.

1165
01:07:27,849 --> 01:07:29,090
Answer me.

1166
01:07:29,305 --> 01:07:33,928
Do you want that dog or me?

1167
01:07:34,122 --> 01:07:36,230
Hey! Why are you talking like that?

1168
01:07:36,398 --> 01:07:37,939
Don't bring him between us.

1169
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:41,935
Oh!
You get angry when I talk about the dog, right?

1170
01:07:42,910 --> 01:07:44,793
I've been patient till now.

1171
01:07:44,804 --> 01:07:46,122
I can't do this anymore.

1172
01:07:46,751 --> 01:07:48,162
You can live happily with that dog.

1173
01:07:48,163 --> 01:07:49,590
I'll find my way.

1174
01:07:55,998 --> 01:07:57,750
Hey, Kavi! What are you doing?

1175
01:07:57,972 --> 01:07:59,720
Why are you planning to leave?

1176
01:07:59,731 --> 01:08:01,770
Think about it before you say anything.

1177
01:08:01,858 --> 01:08:03,731
You'll understand how you behave.

1178
01:08:03,742 --> 01:08:06,681
Everyone says that a dog is more
important for you than your wife.

1179
01:08:06,692 --> 01:08:08,458
I cannot hear such words again.

1180
01:08:08,633 --> 01:08:10,595
I cannot stay in this house.

1181
01:08:10,689 --> 01:08:12,614
People talk about rubbish!
Why do you listen to them?

1182
01:08:12,615 --> 01:08:13,027
Go inside.

1183
01:08:13,028 --> 01:08:15,009
What should I do by staying here?

1184
01:08:15,958 --> 01:08:17,626
This is all because of you.

1185
01:08:17,741 --> 01:08:19,059
Get lost from here.

1186
01:08:19,070 --> 01:08:20,894
Hey!
Why are you scolding him?

1187
01:08:20,982 --> 01:08:21,750
What did he do?

1188
01:08:21,812 --> 01:08:22,702
Oh!

1189
01:08:23,127 --> 01:08:24,927
You still support your dog, right?

1190
01:08:25,383 --> 01:08:26,990
You're right.

1191
01:08:27,407 --> 01:08:30,127
I am crazy.

1192
01:08:30,624 --> 01:08:33,520
Okay! Why should I stay here then?

1193
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:35,277
I'll leave.
Hey…

1194
01:08:36,086 --> 01:08:36,990
Listen, Kavi.

1195
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:38,023
Don't touch me.

1196
01:08:38,352 --> 01:08:39,678
Don't touch me.
Listen, Kavi.

1197
01:08:40,151 --> 01:08:41,815
You shouldn't get angry about this.

1198
01:08:41,826 --> 01:08:44,127
What have I asked you? Tell me.

1199
01:08:44,295 --> 01:08:48,240
As a woman, I want to be a mother.
Is it wrong?

1200
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:50,639
Is it wrong to have kids?

1201
01:08:51,958 --> 01:08:56,570
Kavi! He's like our kid.

1202
01:08:57,394 --> 01:09:01,411
What? Is that dog our kid?

1203
01:09:02,296 --> 01:09:05,241
Oh! Is that what you think it is?

1204
01:09:06,313 --> 01:09:10,250
There's no need!
I understood that you don't need kids.

1205
01:09:11,587 --> 01:09:18,497
See!
I won't stay here if you do not want kids.

1206
01:09:20,616 --> 01:09:22,146
Oh no! Kavi!

1207
01:09:23,129 --> 01:09:24,018
Get lost.

1208
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:25,237
Hey, Kavi!

1209
01:09:26,007 --> 01:09:26,733
Stop!

1210
01:09:29,866 --> 01:09:31,018
What do you want?

1211
01:09:37,498 --> 01:09:41,933
Decide whether I should stay here or that dog.

1212
01:09:44,296 --> 01:09:44,909
Kavi.

1213
01:10:13,741 --> 01:10:17,672
Oh no! What the hell!

1214
01:10:19,429 --> 01:10:21,373
What's wrong with you?

1215
01:10:23,061 --> 01:10:25,402
Hey! She got angry and she left.

1216
01:10:25,413 --> 01:10:26,696
What should I do now?

1217
01:10:26,707 --> 01:10:28,665
Why are you angry with me?

1218
01:10:28,768 --> 01:10:31,115
Have you been waiting for her outside?

1219
01:10:31,375 --> 01:10:32,689
She'll come back.

1220
01:10:32,863 --> 01:10:34,735
You might get a fever if you get wet.
Come in.

1221
01:10:37,186 --> 01:10:38,198
Come inside.

1222
01:10:39,577 --> 01:10:40,694
Come, Gundu.

1223
01:10:44,858 --> 01:10:46,161
Let me call your mother.

1224
01:10:53,702 --> 01:10:54,680
Hey, Kavi!

1225
01:10:54,691 --> 01:10:56,764
You called me instead of your wife.

1226
01:10:56,775 --> 01:10:58,059
[INNER VOICE]: 'Did I call you?'

1227
01:10:58,070 --> 01:10:59,756
Check the number and dial.

1228
01:10:59,757 --> 01:11:00,330
Hey!

1229
01:11:00,341 --> 01:11:02,038
I called to talk to you.

1230
01:11:02,389 --> 01:11:03,825
Where have you been?

1231
01:11:03,884 --> 01:11:04,614
Hey!

1232
01:11:04,735 --> 01:11:08,018
Idiot!
Are your senses gone along with my sister?

1233
01:11:10,358 --> 01:11:11,522
Okay…

1234
01:11:12,156 --> 01:11:13,106
Did you eat anything?

1235
01:11:13,559 --> 01:11:17,107
Gundu has been damped
in the rain ever since you left.

1236
01:11:17,609 --> 01:11:21,194
I should take him to the
hospital if he gets a fever.

1237
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:22,834
[INNER VOICE]: 'What's wrong with him?'

1238
01:11:22,930 --> 01:11:24,643
Okay. Hang up!
I'll come and talk to you.

1239
01:11:25,211 --> 01:11:26,653
What will you speak, man?

1240
01:11:26,875 --> 01:11:28,612
Here! Talk to your mother.

1241
01:11:31,780 --> 01:11:33,592
Okay…

1242
01:11:33,603 --> 01:11:34,882
Are you coming home in the evening?

1243
01:11:34,893 --> 01:11:36,356
Okay. Gundu will come in.

1244
01:11:36,602 --> 01:11:42,067
Oh! Are you acting before Gundu
as if you were talking to your wife?

1245
01:11:43,155 --> 01:11:46,803
A friend in need is a friend indeed.

1246
01:11:46,864 --> 01:11:48,867
I'll get some alcohol.

1247
01:11:48,926 --> 01:11:51,395
Let's booze and enjoy it.

1248
01:11:52,218 --> 01:11:53,392
Okay. See you.

1249
01:11:53,461 --> 01:11:54,199
Come fast.

1250
01:11:56,070 --> 01:11:58,944
She said she'd come
back the day after tomorrow.

1251
01:11:58,955 --> 01:12:00,383
Why are you still angry?

1252
01:12:00,394 --> 01:12:02,321
Why are you stubborn?

1253
01:12:02,847 --> 01:12:05,035
Okay! Let's freshen up and pray.
Come.

1254
01:12:05,084 --> 01:12:05,736
Come inside.

1255
01:12:07,452 --> 01:12:08,288
Come.

1256
01:12:09,374 --> 01:12:10,160
Come.

1257
01:12:14,819 --> 01:12:17,080
You're lucky to have such a husband.

1258
01:12:17,091 --> 01:12:18,883
No mother-in-law or sister-in-law!

1259
01:12:18,945 --> 01:12:20,819
You should be ashamed of yourself.

1260
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:25,025
Aren't you worried about
what people might think?

1261
01:12:25,127 --> 01:12:26,672
Stop nagging!

1262
01:12:27,577 --> 01:12:28,644
I am disappointed.

1263
01:12:30,694 --> 01:12:31,757
Serve me one more crepe.

1264
01:12:34,077 --> 01:12:42,833
Women leave their husbands if they are bad,
torturing, or if they have affairs.

1265
01:12:42,972 --> 01:12:45,478
Is it wrong to raise a dog?

1266
01:12:45,621 --> 01:12:46,855
How can you leave him?

1267
01:12:46,933 --> 01:12:49,160
I've not seen anyone like you.

1268
01:12:50,012 --> 01:12:52,158
What a great father you are!

1269
01:12:53,165 --> 01:12:56,238
A lot has happened and you simply
watch TV without caring about it.

1270
01:12:56,249 --> 01:12:58,061
Your daughter left her husband.

1271
01:12:58,095 --> 01:13:03,800
Before people start to gossip,
find out what her problem is.

1272
01:13:04,925 --> 01:13:08,625
Kavitha! Your issue isn't a big one.

1273
01:13:09,038 --> 01:13:12,682
You should adjust whenever there's a fight.

1274
01:13:13,321 --> 01:13:15,693
The husband might say something to you.

1275
01:13:15,835 --> 01:13:17,622
He's bonded to you in marriage.

1276
01:13:17,633 --> 01:13:19,533
You should respect him.

Hey! What's your problem?

1279

Ask her.

She might open up to you at least.

1281

A dog is an issue in her marital life.

just because he raises a dog?

Whom should I kill?

1306
01:14:45,524 --> 01:14:47,771
I need 1 lakh for bail and
1 more lakh for the deal.

You mean, you want me to get that dog?

She's never been home this long.

Maybe she is pregnant.

It doesn't look that way.

01:22:06,849 --> 01:22:08,403
Gundu and that lamb are good friends.

1458
01:22:08,672 --> 01:22:09,152
Oh!

1459
01:22:09,153 --> 01:22:11,030
Gundu thinks this is that lamb.

1460
01:22:11,485 --> 01:22:12,836
That's why he is feeling bad.

1461
01:22:12,847 --> 01:22:13,558
Oh!

1462
01:22:39,098 --> 01:22:40,494
Where is it?
I cannot find it.

Brother?
Go there and stand.

1465
01:22:43,988 --> 01:22:44,748
Okay, brother.

1466
01:22:46,004 --> 01:22:46,765
Take this.

1467
01:22:47,140 --> 01:22:48,820
Hold the sack and stand here.

1468
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:49,573
Okay, brother.

1469
01:22:49,630 --> 01:22:50,548
I'll be in the front.

01:22:51,099 --> 01:22:53,054
Brother! Where is the sack for me?

1471
01:22:53,284 --> 01:22:56,732
Hey! Who will shoot it if you hold the sack?

1472
01:22:56,809 --> 01:22:57,698
Brother!

1473
01:22:59,965 --> 01:23:00,995
What's that for?

1474
01:23:01,285 --> 01:23:05,737
Brother!
My dad gave me toy guns during my childhood.

1475
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:08,212
You gave me the original gun.

1476
01:23:08,356 --> 01:23:10,152
I am happy, brother.

1477
01:23:10,215 --> 01:23:11,846
Aim properly and shoot.

1478
01:23:12,758 --> 01:23:14,143
Aim the leg!

1479
01:23:14,629 --> 01:23:15,530
Okay, brother.
Hey!

1480
01:23:15,588 --> 01:23:17,338
Not me! I said about the dog.

1481
01:23:17,451 --> 01:23:18,548
Go for it.
Okay, brother…

1482
01:23:19,003 --> 01:23:21,574
Brother! What about me?
I gave you the sack, right?

1483
01:23:21,585 --> 01:23:22,428
Work on it.

1484
01:23:22,499 --> 01:23:23,452
Do you get it?

1485
01:23:23,824 --> 01:23:25,580
You should put it in the sack.

1486
01:23:25,756 --> 01:23:29,779
If it misses, I will grab it.

1487
01:23:29,809 --> 01:23:31,188
Okay, brother…
Okay?

01:23:31,435 --> 01:23:32,942
Come on! Move!
Okay, brother.

Hey, come on.

1492
01:23:45,646 --> 01:23:47,400
Grab it…
You cannot let it go today.

1493
01:23:47,464 --> 01:23:48,600
We missed it last time.

1494

Grab it!

1495
01:23:49,676 --> 01:23:51,596
Throw the sack on it. Come on.

Hey! Shoot!

1497
01:23:52,839 --> 01:23:55,287
Hey! I asked you to shoot the dog.
Why did you shoot him?

1498
01:23:55,288 --> 01:23:57,574
Hey! It is coming towards me.
Hey…

1499
01:23:57,654 --> 01:23:59,690
It will get me again.
Hey…

1500
01:23:59,701 --> 01:24:01,991
I plead you.
Save me…

1501
01:24:05,137 --> 01:24:09,607
You got one bandage.
Within a half-day, it bit you again.

1502
01:24:10,078 --> 01:24:13,615
What would happen to you
if it bites somewhere else?

1503
01:24:14,646 --> 01:24:15,886
Sacks don't work.

1504
01:24:15,950 --> 01:24:16,646
Yes, brother.

1505
01:24:16,784 --> 01:24:19,918
My next deal would be different.

1506
01:24:19,929 --> 01:24:20,687
Okay, brother.

1507
01:24:20,775 --> 01:24:22,222
I have another plan for it.

1508
01:24:23,030 --> 01:24:24,006
What plan?

1509
01:24:24,406 --> 01:24:25,454
Do you know what this is?

1510
01:24:26,379 --> 01:24:27,248
What is this, brother?

1511
01:24:27,601 --> 01:24:28,624
It is an old one.

Scent bottle!
Is it, brother!

1513
01:24:30,528 --> 01:24:32,486
It won't get up for three
days if you spray this.

1514
01:24:32,487 --> 01:24:33,613
What about excretion?

1515
01:24:33,668 --> 01:24:34,648
Will you try?

1516
01:24:34,698 --> 01:24:35,651
No, brother.

1517
01:24:38,278 --> 01:24:41,102
Brother! Will it work?

1518
01:24:47,526 --> 01:24:50,142
It works indeed.

1519
01:24:55,145 --> 01:24:57,388
Brother! Is the dog here?

1520
01:24:57,887 --> 01:25:00,072
He won't grab the dog.

1521
01:25:00,137 --> 01:25:01,273
There won't be sunrise.

1522
01:25:01,305 --> 01:25:03,376
We have to stay here all night.

1523
01:25:03,608 --> 01:25:06,073
Why did I promise to get the dog?

1524

It is the dog sleeping right before us. See!

It did not sleep.

1530
01:25:58,699 --> 01:25:59,668
I sprayed this.

The dog is escaping.
Catch it…

I don't like kidnapping that dog.

Hey, idiot! You can never get that dog.

What happened, brother? Why is there a crowd?

A dog got lorry hit by a lorry and died.
