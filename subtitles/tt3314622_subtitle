1
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:35,922
Hello!

2
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:38,491
J! Did our daughter sleep?

3
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:41,255
Hey! She's just taking her dinner.

4
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:43,863
Shika! Shall I come?

5
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:45,490
Oh no. It'll be late now.

6
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:47,867
Okay. Let me do a matter.

7
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:49,669
Let me go there by a cab.

8
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:50,803
You'll manage. Right?

9
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:51,804
It's okay. No problem.

10
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:53,169
Will you come late? No.

11
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:54,874
Close the shop.

12
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:55,842
And leave the key at home.

13
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:56,831
Okay? -Okay, ma'am.

14
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:04,517
Sir! Take me to Nagore.

15
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:04,881
Okay!

16
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:31,852
Papa!

17
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,692
Papa!

18
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:39,899
Good morning.

19
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:40,957
Come and sit.

20
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:45,905
Let’s take milk and breakfast.

21
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,907
Let's go to school getting fresh.

22
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,041
What do you say? -Yeah.

23
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,910
You'd drink milk in 5 minutes.

24
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:51,811
Okay?

25
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:52,612
Okay!

26
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:56,015
Then... Ms.Meenakshi Jayakrishnan.

27
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:58,451
What breakfast do you want?

28
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:00,853
Bread or noodles.

29
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:02,922
Nothing except these. Right?

30
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:08,127
I'll get you idly and sambar...

31
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:09,762
...from the restaurant.

32
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:10,730
Okay?

33
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:11,764
Okay!

34
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,533
Take milk and get ready fast.

35
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:14,634
It's time to go to school.

36
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:15,001
Okay?

37
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:16,936
Good girl.

38
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:17,903
Is it chill?

39
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,672
Shall I ask you a thing?

40
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:20,940
Ask me.

41
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,709
Do you know whom I like most?

42
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:24,744
I don't know.

43
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:25,912
My Meenu dear!

44
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:27,447
My sweet Papa.

45
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,014
My dear baby!

46
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:30,107
Can you obey your dad's words?

47
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:32,618
Shall we go to meet mummy?

48
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,153
I'm scared, Papa.

49
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:35,121
Please dear!

50
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,689
Let's go and meet mummy once.

51
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:37,883
I'm scared, Papa.

52
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:50,895
My lord!

53
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:59,479
I kindly pray and plea...

54
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,114
To drop all the charges
levelled against him.

55
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:03,549
And to let him free.

56
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:04,481
Thank you, my lord.

57
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:07,920
Permission granted.

58
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,046
And the court is adjourned.

59
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:16,028
Is it so long since you came?

60
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:18,053
I've by hearted court time now.

61
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:20,132
Everything will be alright, man.

62
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:21,901
Let that trial be started.

63
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:24,937
Sorry to ask. Any progress?

64
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:26,138
Through Indian embassy...

65
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:27,571
I've given maximum pressure.

66
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:30,142
They can't drag it at any cost.

67
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:31,944
We'd remember a matter.

68
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:33,946
Kambala city's mayor is position.

69
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,948
If I say accurately...

70
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:37,550
Everything beyond the judicial...

71
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,847
...is there under him!

72
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:41,954
This country and its set up.

73
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:43,512
You know it.

74
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:46,559
Only one month maximum.

75
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,260
Before that...

76
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,262
Investigation will be reopened.

77
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:52,265
I have enough contacts for that.

78
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:53,596
Don't worry.

79
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:03,242
Irene was locked alone
inside the castle.

80
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:05,545
It was so dark and terrifying.

81
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,080
She sat there gazing
at the dark clouds.

82
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,716
Waiting for her saviour.

83
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:14,618
When will Prince
come-to save Irene?

84
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:21,919
Prince will come.

85
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:24,930
You sleep. Okay?

86
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:27,600
Lay down!

87
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,727
Good night. -Good night.

88
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,338
To get escaped and hide...

89
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,974
We can't see any other place than this.

90
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:09,942
Uganda!

91
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,811
Nobody believe even if we say.

92
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:12,311
Why?

93
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:14,146
My close friends too...

94
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:16,273
They didn't believe as I'm in Uganda.

95
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:20,686
We tried a lot to stay there itself.

96
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:23,422
But by the influence of Shika's father.

97
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:24,690
To stay there...!

98
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,058
Let it be.

99
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:27,855
Shika's guts!

100
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:30,429
We can decide to live together.

101
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:32,363
But the place is not in our hands.

102
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:34,367
One of my friend is here.

103
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,002
Friend? Who is that?

104
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:37,403
Angel Mathews!

105
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,438
Oh! I know her.

106
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:40,928
She's a famous party.

107
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:43,242
I can say about Malayali.

108
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:46,178
You've come with that faith. Right?

109
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:47,338
Feroz is also here. Right?

110
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,219
Why didn't you take anything?

111
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:53,986
Have it.

112
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,922
That's... -Philopea. Fleshy fish!

113
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:58,048
From river Nile.

114
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,925
Nile’s pride is seen more in Uganda.

115
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:05,464
When she has seen
such a fleshy fish...

116
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:08,401
I'm going to order the next item.

117
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,036
Hey man!

118
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:12,338
Get me one crocodile manchurian.

119
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,965
And a gross hopper fry.

120
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,841
Don't you know grass hopper?

121
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,476
It's green insect in our country.

122
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:19,171
Do you know how tasty it is!

123
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,184
We'd ask and get everything here.

124
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,053
There's a dark life here.

125
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:29,288
But to earn money...

126
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:30,890
If we earn much...

127
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,983
...we'd leave immediately.

128
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:36,162
Other Malayalees here...

129
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:37,863
Eight to ten families are here.

130
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,694
But associations are four.

131
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,302
Go and meet Gauthem
by tomorrow.

132
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:45,004
Sure! -I told him everything.

133
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:48,963
He's the only trustworthy Malayali.

134
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:15,935
Hey! My purse!

135
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:17,163
My purse!

136
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:49,864
Chakulathamman!

137
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:03,449
Oh mother! Oh my goddess!

138
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,007
Excuse me.

139
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:09,054
Gauthem sir! -Yes.

140
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:10,055
I'm Jaya Krishnan.

141
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:11,524
Advocate Feroz sir told me...

142
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:13,459
I've understood. Come.

143
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,483
Come.

144
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:18,330
This is not a beam.

145
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,064
It's a Kolam.

146
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:20,366
Read through and bring it.

147
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:21,264
Okay?

148
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:26,872
You came with a rubber
owner's daughter.

149
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:29,308
A bike taxi man in your is also over.

150
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:32,243
If we think, all are mirage.

151
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,046
He's coming.

152
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:35,114
Finished so soon? -Sir!

153
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:36,882
Which beam I'd change?

154
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:38,484
Hey! Sorry!

155
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,619
Go. Hell with this beam.

156
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:42,454
Do you know his name?

157
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:44,423
Luchiyanakambochki.

158
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:48,519
Everybody will be like burnt papers.

159
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,193
It's Chakulathama's grace. Come.

160
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:56,135
What's your qualification?

161
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:58,035
B.Tech. But I didn't complete it.

162
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:00,031
Then PDC.

163
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,942
If you think sir... -What?

164
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:04,034
To complete B.Tech?

165
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:05,578
Not that, sir.

166
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:06,979
You can call me Gauthem.

167
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:07,179
Sure.

168
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,578
Not without respect.

169
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:12,151
I told your matter to my friend.

170
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:13,285
Kevin Dikolo!

171
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:15,087
He's got a coffee shop.

172
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:16,055
Coffee shop!

173
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:17,317
Why do you feel bad?

174
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:20,226
A big group with 10,000 people.

175
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:21,861
A manager post there.

176
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:22,895
Thank you, sir.

177
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:24,163
Sorry. Gauthem.

178
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:27,032
It's Chakulathaman's grace only.

179
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:30,436
Join in your job praying
God tomorrow.

180
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:31,070
Sure!

181
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,298
All the best. -Thank you.

182
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,049
Hi!

183
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,184
Hi!

184
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:46,518
Don't you feel boring?

185
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:48,053
Boring? Here?

186
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,388
It was boring to me in home.

187
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,490
What an amazing place!

188
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:54,159
As Uganda is such a beautiful place.

189
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:56,061
If we say, will anybody believe it?

190
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,997
Isn't it beautiful?

191
00:14:57,997 --> 00:14:58,429
Beautiful!

192
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:02,134
The great lake Victoria.

193
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:04,203
Worlds second largest fresh water lake.

194
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:05,431
It's like Sri Lanka.

195
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:08,405
No. How about your work?

196
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,043
So far so good.

197
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,211
Yeah.

198
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:14,046
It's now off season.

199
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:15,214
But I had a party today.

200
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,448
People and their culture.

201
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:18,050
...are too different.

202
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,919
Only one problem is there.

203
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,656
Language problem only.

204
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:25,057
Is there no other problem?

205
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:26,581
Come on. Let's go.

206
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:33,432
What's this?

207
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,700
Crocodile fry...?

208
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,201
Shall I order a plate parcel?

209
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:38,070
It'll be like a chewing gum.

210
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,264
Did you taste it?

211
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:41,974
Dear! Don't threaten me.

212
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:42,941
It's not the time for that.

213
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:56,050
Stop it!

214
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,554
What the hell, girls?

215
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:02,289
How many times did I tell you?

216
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:06,131
See the show prefer in the centre.

217
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,928
Like this!

218
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:27,419
Today is the last run.

219
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:29,188
Understand? Please.

220
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:30,356
Okay!

221
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:33,052
Hi! -Hi!

222
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,297
I was so shocked to get your call.

223
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:39,958
What a lovely coincidence?

224
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:44,703
Pala Angel! What a change?

225
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:45,304
Thank you.

226
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:47,106
You were famous there too. Right?

227
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:48,130
Is it?

228
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:51,076
Hey! This is my husband Jai.

229
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:52,373
Oh! Hi! Angel!

230
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:54,046
Nice to meet you.

231
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:56,014
Can I steal your wife for a second?

232
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:57,783
Go ahead.

233
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,084
Thank you.

234
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:00,483
He's okay. Right?

235
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:05,283
You wanted to date Abhishek Bachchan.

236
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:08,327
I thought you'd select
Prithvirajan at least.

237
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:10,095
What lacks for my Jai?

238
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:12,031
Hey! No!

239
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,099
So... How is your life?

240
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:14,656
Got a job?

241
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,468
Full time job.

242
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:17,102
Full time?

243
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:18,037
Housewife.

244
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,805
Housewife. You?

245
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:21,373
Come on.

246
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,342
You got a profession. Right?

247
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:24,570
Fashion designing.

248
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,746
A good scope for this here.

249
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:29,114
And I can help you.

250
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:30,479
So don't worry.

251
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,084
What?

252
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:33,352
You want his permission. Right?

253
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:35,687
No. -ls he jovial?

254
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:36,483
Go, girl.

255
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:40,392
Hey! Audra!

256
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:41,760
Come!

257
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,162
Hey! Welcome.

258
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:44,563
Hi. How are you?

259
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:45,731
Fine. Thank you.

260
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,166
Meet my friend Sikha.

261
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,100
Nice to meet you.

262
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,101
Audra mayor's daughter.

263
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:50,436
She is my very close friend.

264
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:51,425
Jai! Come.

265
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,472
That's Shika's husband.

266
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:54,339
Oh hi!

267
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:55,274
I'm Jai!

268
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:56,508
Alright, guys.

269
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:58,277
we are ready for the last rehearsal.

270
00:17:58,277 --> 00:17:59,111
Let's run through.

271
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:01,146
Please take your seats.

272
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:03,080
Girls! Come on.

273
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,526
How is this?

274
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:16,517
What's it? Your mummy's nighty?

275
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:20,766
This is the house scope.

276
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,135
I've stitched it buying
fabric in Uganda.

277
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:24,870
We call this as a nighty.

278
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,605
Although turn back. Let me see.

279
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,799
Useless.

280
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:33,573
My dear Shika Samuel...

281
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:39,082
I married you and brought here seeing this.

282
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,654
You tell that Angel Mathew.

283
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:47,318
As you'll stitch a world class design.

284
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,089
Shall I tell her?

285
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:54,257
Tell! Let's start a boutique.

286
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:00,139
Hey! You happy?

287
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,141
Do you love me?

288
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,166
Yeah. -Yeah.

289
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:38,910
You're sweet like honey. Right?

290
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:46,218
You're sweet like honey. Right?

291
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:50,289
As you roam in my shadow...

292
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:53,759
You’re the parrot of my own dreams.

293
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:57,262
As you roam in my shadow...

294
00:19:57,262 --> 00:20:00,832
You’re the parrot of my own dreams.

295
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:03,569
You won't part me ever.

296
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:07,306
You're the wings of a white bird.

297
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:10,642
Can you come closer to me?

298
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:14,669
Having sweet honey in your lips...

299
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:48,979
Kisses of your cute lips will be in my heart.

300
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:52,676
My heart gives tunes like a lullaby song.

301
00:20:55,988 --> 00:21:01,620
The moon has come really in my way.

302
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:08,927
Can you teach me the hugging art?

303
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:17,033
You're sweet like honey. Right?

304
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,938
You're sweet like honey. Right?

305
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:32,951
Vow! What a beautiful gown!

306
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:34,111
What should I do in this?

307
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:40,456
You'd work and give
before 6 o'clock.

308
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:43,495
It's a little urgent.

309
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:44,663
Stonework only. Right?

310
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:45,597
Yeah.

311
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:46,732
I'll give it before 6 o'clock.

312
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:48,033
Thanks. -But...

313
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,035
It may be my own design.

314
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,470
Oh sure! -Okay?

315
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,038
Okay! -Okay!

316
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,972
Bye! -Bye!

317
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,888
Come on, Angel.

318
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:12,023
This is the best chance we ever get.

319
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:13,024
For how long we will do this...

320
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:15,652
...goddamn thing for some one else.

321
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:18,663
I mean 9 million dollars.

322
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:19,831
That is huge.

323
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:21,700
Shika will get the diamonds.

324
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,101
To my house around 6 p.m.

325
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:24,669
Will she be on time?

326
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:25,036
Of course.

327
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:26,128
She might have started already.

328
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:29,541
Somehow I feel...

329
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:30,909
...this is not right, Audra.

330
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:34,780
I mean... Isn't it high risk?

331
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,949
Angel! This is my country.

332
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:39,851
I know how to do the game.

333
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:40,875
So you chill.

334
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:43,855
Let me do a thing.

335
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:45,524
Let me go there by a cab.

336
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:46,591
You'll manage. Right?

337
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:47,626
It's okay. No problem.

338
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:48,991
Will you be late? -No.

339
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:51,696
Close the shop and leave key at home.

340
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:51,997
Okay?

341
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:55,000
You're late by enjoying
with your friend.

342
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,903
Daughter will feel. Papa too.

343
00:23:57,903 --> 00:23:59,838
You tell your daughter...

344
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:02,007
I'll come home and convince her.

345
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:04,009
Not only to my daughter.

346
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:05,977
Then? Papa too.

347
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:21,019
Shika! Shika!

348
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,850
I'm sorry, Shika.

349
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:44,067
Shika Samuel!

350
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,638
Hello! -Good morning.

351
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:47,739
Good morning.

352
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:50,375
When did you come home?

353
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:53,178
I... Hey! Dosa is burning.

354
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:55,009
Move. What's this?

355
00:26:57,082 --> 00:27:00,347
Why is Shika Samuel's face is dull?

356
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:03,045
When did you come home last night?

357
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:10,220
I understood reason of your dullness now.

358
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:15,023
Hey! I slept unknowingly last night.

359
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,836
Okay. Tell me this.

360
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:19,270
Angel liked the design?

361
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,032
What did she say?

362
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:22,767
Something wrong?

363
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:27,875
Jai! I have to tell you a matter.

364
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,651
Actually last night... -What?

365
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:33,379
What happened?

366
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:36,714
May be Patrick. One second.

367
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,020
I'll come now.

368
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:42,694
Hi, I'm Chandrasekhar...

369
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:43,762
...from Indian high commission.

370
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:44,929
Yeah. -Shika Samuel.

371
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:46,055
Yeah. She's my wife.

372
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:48,865
Mom!

373
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,067
Come!

374
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:55,106
Hey! What's it?

375
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:58,109
Hello! Mister officer!

376
00:27:58,109 --> 00:27:59,110
This is my house.

377
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:02,045
Shika Samuel? Yeah.

378
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:04,883
Ma'am! You have
a friend called Angel?

379
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:06,043
Angel Mathew!

380
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:08,820
Yeah.

381
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,151
Did you meet her yesterday?

382
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,780
No.

383
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,950
Are you sure about that?

384
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:18,129
Yeah.

385
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:20,120
Then, where were you last night?

386
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:24,958
I was here.

387
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:28,129
Okay!

388
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:29,869
Bring him!

389
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:42,813
Is she the one?

390
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:44,955
Yes, sir.

391
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:50,495
Okay. You go.

392
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:51,484
Thank you, sir.

393
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:57,058
Ma'am! You have to come with us.

394
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:03,374
We’re taking her.

395
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:04,175
But for what?

396
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:06,111
2 murders were committed yesterday.

397
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:08,909
Mayor's daughter and
Shika's friend Angel!

398
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:11,846
And your wife is the prime suspect.

399
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:15,382
What's happening, Shika?

400
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:21,082
Shika! Tell me.

401
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:25,426
Shika!

402
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:37,867
On what basis are you taking her?

403
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:41,112
This is ridiculous.

404
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:41,946
On what grounds?

405
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:42,947
Mr. Jayakrishnan!

406
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:43,448
Please co-operate.

407
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,016
But this is so cruel.

408
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:45,917
Let's go.

409
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:47,885
Shika! What's happening?

410
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,288
Sir, please.

411
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,523
I want to consult my lawyer.

412
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:52,557
Please!

413
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:54,081
Nothing. -Shika!

414
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:55,927
Shika!

415
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:57,326
Papa! Shika!

416
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:01,399
Shika! -Jai! -Shika!

417
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:03,134
Why didn't you tell me?

418
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:06,404
Shika! Why didn't you tell me?

419
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:09,140
Papa!

420
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:12,377
Sorry. -Shika! -Papa!

421
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:15,210
Sorry. -Shika!

422
00:30:58,156 --> 00:30:59,457
Meenu?

423
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:04,258
I came dropping her in school.

424
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:14,866
Can I see her only once?

425
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:21,179
I can convince our embassy in trial.

426
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:23,306
I can get bail if the trial starts.

427
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:26,150
Feroz Khan is confident.

428
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:28,410
Don't worry.

429
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:33,119
I'll bring our daughter too next time.

430
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:35,085
Without fail!

431
00:31:37,695 --> 00:31:45,124
No need. She need not see me so.

432
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:50,140
She's calm now only
after asking of you.

433
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:54,012
After when she comes from school...

434
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:56,180
Saying school's incidents
to your photo...

435
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:56,669
It's her hobby.

436
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:07,391
Let me leave.

437
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:56,634
So you’re telling me...

438
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:58,568
Both these murders were committed
by the same lady.

439
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,738
Yes sir. All the evidence point that.

440
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:02,774
A lady living with her husband and child.

441
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:05,176
Without any criminal record.

442
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:08,212
Randomly commits not 1 but 2 murders.

443
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,305
What could bethe motive?

444
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:14,185
No motive. No witnesses.

445
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:16,421
Absolutely no criminal background.

446
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:17,522
But yet we say...

447
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:18,716
She committed these crimes.

448
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:20,452
Right?

449
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:22,559
Very interesting.

450
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:24,662
Mickanze!

451
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:27,565
I need to chat with everyone in this case.

452
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:31,069
I need the details
of all attached in this case.

453
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,204
On my desk ASAP.

454
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:35,206
Arrange for a meeting
with her lawyer.

455
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:37,197
We are re-opening the case.

456
00:34:41,712 --> 00:34:43,114
Good morning!

457
00:34:43,114 --> 00:34:43,848
Good morning.

458
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:46,217
Yes. I'm Martin Morize!

459
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:46,517
Hello!

460
00:34:46,517 --> 00:34:48,219
I'm new officer and in charge of this case.

461
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:49,320
He is Adam Mekenze.

462
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,555
Assisting me in this case.

463
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:51,613
Hi! -Hello!

464
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:56,360
I've gone through the files.

465
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,197
Indian embassy
has special interest in this case.

466
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:01,495
See! The whole play is fabricated.

467
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:03,367
Somebody set her up.

468
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:05,301
Because she is not an Ugandan citizen.

469
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:06,737
She's denied justice.

470
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:07,505
Mr. Feroz!

471
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:09,273
It's not about which country's citizen...

472
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:10,208
...committed the crime.

473
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,210
It's about the crime itself.

474
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:15,270
In fact one of the victims is of Indian origin.

475
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:17,882
And I'm here to see that the trial...

476
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:18,678
...happens fast.

477
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,352
And if she is found guilty...

478
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:24,355
She will spend the rest of her life in Luzira.

479
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:25,287
You start the trial.

480
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:27,191
Okay!

481
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:29,227
I'll see you in the court.

482
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:30,461
Thank you.

483
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:30,728
Tell them we are different.

484
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:33,865
Tell them we are different.

485
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:38,700
Ugandan's are different. Not to play.

486
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:52,216
So... Now he is behind Audra.

487
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:53,918
He is trying to dig out her past.

488
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:56,821
Did he pass
any information to police?

489
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,723
Unofficially yes.

490
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:01,225
He had a meeting with Martin Morize.

491
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:03,694
What's Morize take on that?

492
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:05,563
I'm not sure.

493
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:06,697
What ever it is!

494
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:08,266
It's not going to help us.

495
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:09,600
Now look.

496
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,397
I want to meet Martin Morize.

497
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:15,766
Fix me a meet. -Okay!

498
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:49,202
I didn't.

499
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:51,708
I didn't kill your daughter

500
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:56,881
I told you several times.

501
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,577
Why do you look scared?

502
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:05,379
I found you supposed to be happy.

503
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:12,920
Fight back through your embassy.

504
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:17,268
You think you can win?

505
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:18,565
No.

506
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:23,641
Now listen you fool!

507
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:27,702
Your trial is not going to take place.

508
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:31,779
I'm here to see your fate.

509
00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:36,921
To see... To see that you suffer.

510
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:42,325
To see you shed last drop of tear.

511
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:02,241
Dear! Give a kiss to your Papa.

512
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:08,619
Let's come to play area tomorrow evening.

513
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:13,056
I'll fill the card fully for Meenu to play.

514
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:22,559
It's okay, man.

515
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:26,459
Stupid!

516
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,029
It's okay.

517
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:35,079
This is very bad.

518
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:36,046
This is the road.

519
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:37,979
Shuck!

520
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,993
Papa!

521
00:38:58,102 --> 00:38:59,069
Papa!

522
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:01,700
Papa!

523
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:28,722
Hey!

524
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,102
Hey! See!

525
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:32,831
Catch him.

526
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:10,499
Sir!

527
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:12,136
You see, mister.

528
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,205
I call you if I need your statement.

529
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:16,540
This is an investigation office.

530
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,565
I don't want you unless called for.

531
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:20,107
Do you understand?

532
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,717
If he'd not come there at that time...

533
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:44,229
However I bear from
the past 6 months.

534
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:47,671
I suffer as I can't do anything.

535
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:51,275
I got an anonymous call.

536
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:53,811
If I don't get back from this case...

537
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:54,778
They will kill me.

538
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:59,717
Feroz Khan! Only aim is there for us.

539
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:03,087
Bringing out Shika legally.

540
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:05,647
It won't delay hereafter. I'm sure.

541
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:24,297
My daughter called me last night.

542
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:28,144
It's 3 and half years
since I heard her voice.

543
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:32,045
I'm planning to go to my native once.

544
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:34,184
Feroz Khan!

545
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:35,319
Hey! Don't worry.

546
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:38,756
One week. If you need any help...

547
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:39,882
My juniors will take care of it.

548
00:42:42,993 --> 00:42:44,585
I've seen Shika.

549
00:42:46,163 --> 00:42:50,896
But I feel Shika hides
something now too.

550
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:01,978
Papa! Come.

551
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:13,953
Thank you.

552
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:20,995
Shirt is not nice. Your jacket.

553
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:23,125
It's dirty.

554
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,099
Do you like ice ream, dear?

555
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:35,103
Do you like it?

556
00:43:36,213 --> 00:43:39,149
Shall we goto see your mom as I said?

557
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:41,185
No need. Why?

558
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:43,153
There is police in the prison.

559
00:43:43,153 --> 00:43:44,188
Why do you get scared of them?

560
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:45,120
Papa is therewith you. Right?

561
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:49,126
Dear! Please!

562
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:52,186
Let's go. I won't come.

563
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:04,174
Dear! what happened?

564
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:07,378
Hi. Jaya Krishnan.

565
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:09,880
JK. Okay!

566
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:12,416
My native is there near Kerala.

567
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:13,246
Trichy!

568
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:15,986
What's your name?

569
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,655
Meenakshi! -Very good.

570
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,189
Your dad calls you as Meenu.

571
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:19,848
Correct?

572
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:23,160
As how you like Meenu dear...

573
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,795
I like your Kerala fish.

574
00:44:24,795 --> 00:44:27,389
That too... Fish fry will be too good.

575
00:44:28,432 --> 00:44:30,167
What is this uncle saying?

576
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:31,201
That is...

577
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:34,796
I asked him not to get ice cream to you.

578
00:44:35,372 --> 00:44:36,306
Don't get angry on me.

579
00:44:36,306 --> 00:44:37,408
I've just told it.

580
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:39,810
Sir! What's your work here?

581
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:40,902
Work?

582
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:43,908
I'll work sometimes.

583
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:45,375
If I have mood...

584
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:47,982
Can't you get me?

585
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:49,975
I'll tell you.

586
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:52,150
I'll ask a thing before that.

587
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:54,149
What's the problem?

588
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:57,027
Something to wife...

589
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:59,052
Hey! Nothing.

590
00:45:01,932 --> 00:45:03,200
Sir! Your family...?

591
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,168
I didn't get your reply yet.

592
00:45:06,236 --> 00:45:07,771
What happened to your wife?

593
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:09,238
My mom is in prison now.

594
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:13,877
I'm scared to go there.

595
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:15,435
Dear! Not so, JK.

596
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:16,980
Let me tell her.

597
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:19,183
Let's bring your mom here.

598
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:20,047
Okay?

599
00:45:21,118 --> 00:45:22,286
You go and play now.

600
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:23,878
Go!

601
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:28,250
What case?

602
00:45:35,132 --> 00:45:38,226
Murder! But she is innocent.

603
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:42,903
I thought it.

604
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:49,213
Murder. That too Mayor's daughter.

605
00:45:49,213 --> 00:45:51,849
If they send us to jail in such a case...

606
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:53,951
We can't come out in the
next birth too.

607
00:45:53,951 --> 00:45:55,352
Nothing like that.

608
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:57,287
Lawyer told as the trial
would start now.

609
00:45:57,287 --> 00:45:58,822
Didn't this trial get started yet?

610
00:45:58,822 --> 00:45:59,790
How many months it is!

611
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:00,290
Six months.

612
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:03,927
That's all. I'm telling you again.

613
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:06,196
I know this country more than you.

614
00:46:06,196 --> 00:46:08,265
I didn't say Meenu for fun.

615
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:09,926
I can save your wife.

616
00:46:10,901 --> 00:46:13,303
Thinking that I talk so confident?

617
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:14,404
Experience ma.

618
00:46:14,404 --> 00:46:17,373
I need not save your wife.

619
00:46:17,808 --> 00:46:20,210
I'll do nothing for something.

620
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:23,313
But I'll never do something for nothing.

621
00:46:23,313 --> 00:46:24,882
If I say in Uganda language...

622
00:46:24,882 --> 00:46:25,382
You won't understand.

623
00:46:25,382 --> 00:46:27,217
I want money only.

624
00:46:27,217 --> 00:46:28,886
Not necessary.

625
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:30,220
I'm fine. Thank you.

626
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:32,222
Is there no any necessity?

627
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:33,246
See! Is this necessary or not?

628
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:36,493
Your phone only.

629
00:46:36,493 --> 00:46:38,428
I've saved my no in that.

630
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:39,452
You'll need it.

631
00:46:40,564 --> 00:46:43,233
A history is there about your wife's jail.

632
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:44,368
That's an important matter.

633
00:46:44,368 --> 00:46:47,237
Past 5 years,
who escaped from there.

634
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:48,238
The one and only person is...

635
00:46:48,238 --> 00:46:49,907
Antony is that.

636
00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:51,272
Who is that?

637
00:46:55,245 --> 00:46:56,473
It's me only.

638
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:03,053
I'm the whole Uganda, man.

639
00:47:03,053 --> 00:47:07,046
I'm the fair man in this dark country.

640
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:42,052
No. No! No.

641
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:01,204
Christy!

642
00:48:42,953 --> 00:48:44,147
Put her down.

643
00:48:48,025 --> 00:48:50,694
Do you want to bite, lady?

644
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:52,685
I don't know.

645
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:02,272
Sorry!

646
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:04,741
Sorry!

647
00:49:04,741 --> 00:49:05,509
Please!

648
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:07,500
So you don't know who I am.

649
00:49:08,545 --> 00:49:11,248
How dare you touch my people?

650
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:13,239
Put her down.

651
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:19,122
Enjoying?

652
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:20,524
I'm sorry.

653
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:22,225
I'm sorry.

654
00:49:22,225 --> 00:49:23,393
Down again.

655
00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:25,657
This is just a beginning.

656
00:49:31,668 --> 00:49:33,158
Bring her up.

657
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,483
I don't know.

658
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:47,245
Tell me!

659
00:49:48,285 --> 00:49:50,480
How dare you touch my people?

660
00:49:52,122 --> 00:49:54,157
How dare you touch my people?

661
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:55,726
I don't know. Tell me.

662
00:49:55,726 --> 00:49:58,028
I don't know. You don't know?

663
00:49:58,028 --> 00:49:59,154
Beat her up.

664
00:50:00,364 --> 00:50:02,992
Take it. Give it to me.

665
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:31,128
I'm hereto meet Sikha Samuel.

666
00:50:31,128 --> 00:50:31,423
Please.

667
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:35,690
That's all.

668
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:38,769
You are here for the 3rd time.

669
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:40,303
Next time it is not allowed.

670
00:50:40,303 --> 00:50:41,736
Yeah. Sure, sir.

671
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:43,335
Thank you.

672
00:51:22,345 --> 00:51:23,277
Shika!

673
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:30,220
I tried to bring this issue...

674
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:31,278
...before the authorities.

675
00:51:33,156 --> 00:51:36,683
But I have my limitations.

676
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:21,204
I've contacted the Indian embassy.

677
00:52:21,204 --> 00:52:22,472
They are on their way to crime scene.

678
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:23,807
...even as we speak now...

679
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:26,275
I need autopsy reports like yesterday.

680
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:56,499
Arrange for the post mortems.

681
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,914
Antony! -Tell me.

682
00:53:37,914 --> 00:53:39,616
I need her back.

683
00:53:39,616 --> 00:53:42,485
Yeah. This is the right time.

684
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:44,316
Let's break.

685
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:32,501
Want more time to think?

686
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:36,373
But deciding once and...

687
00:54:36,373 --> 00:54:38,898
If you come into my game...

688
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:43,647
Even if the god pulls you...

689
00:54:43,647 --> 00:54:44,875
You can't go out.

690
00:54:46,349 --> 00:54:48,249
I'm giving you one more chance.

691
00:54:49,352 --> 00:54:50,353
Yes or no.

692
00:54:50,353 --> 00:54:53,618
We'd save Shika in anyway.

693
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:55,992
That means yes.

694
00:54:55,992 --> 00:54:57,460
Yes.

695
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:00,293
This case is too serious
than my view.

696
00:55:00,363 --> 00:55:02,465
Your wife killed two people.

697
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:04,467
One among them is, Mayor's daughter.

698
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:06,670
I don't say so.

699
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:07,728
Your case says that.

700
00:55:11,508 --> 00:55:14,636
I'm ready for a war,
which is too tough.

701
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:16,579
If we fail in this...

702
00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:18,843
...we won’t be alive.

703
00:55:19,616 --> 00:55:20,844
I know.

704
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:25,422
Releasing your wife legally...

705
00:55:25,422 --> 00:55:26,356
Impossible.

706
00:55:26,356 --> 00:55:27,657
In an aspect...

707
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:29,559
Closing this case intelligently.

708
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:30,994
Even if we release your wife...

709
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:35,328
Mayor's people will kill your wife.

710
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:37,367
Why do you see?

711
00:55:37,367 --> 00:55:38,535
I'm telling the truth.

712
00:55:38,535 --> 00:55:39,936
You know ldi Amin?

713
00:55:39,936 --> 00:55:42,038
He's President in this country.

714
00:55:42,038 --> 00:55:45,337
So there is only way in front of you.

715
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:47,377
That's saving Shika...

716
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:49,345
Running out of this country soon.

717
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,905
When there is a tight security...

718
00:55:53,783 --> 00:55:55,485
Come to my way.

719
00:55:55,485 --> 00:55:57,721
When I escaped from that jail...

720
00:55:57,721 --> 00:55:59,356
In those 2 routes...

721
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:00,724
They've put a tight security now.

722
00:56:00,724 --> 00:56:02,525
Means we have only one way.

723
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:04,561
That's a dangerous route.

724
00:56:04,561 --> 00:56:08,361
That too for an
ordinary girl like Shika.

725
00:56:09,899 --> 00:56:10,800
Don't worry.

726
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,435
She can get escaped.

727
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:13,903
Then what?

728
00:56:13,903 --> 00:56:19,442
Your life will be settled in Kerala.

729
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:22,673
For me... -That... That!

730
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:25,871
What's Mohanlal's salary movie?

731
00:56:26,683 --> 00:56:28,118
Give me that.

732
00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:30,387
Then? Dear Dinesh!

733
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:32,355
I'm the hero for this story. Right?

734
00:56:33,656 --> 00:56:34,623
Smile well.

735
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:44,664
So...

736
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:47,563
This is your wife's life price.

737
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:48,701
Right?

738
00:56:49,038 --> 00:56:52,409
Sir! -Mistake!

739
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:53,603
It's mine.

740
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:55,978
I'd have told you already.

741
00:56:56,946 --> 00:56:58,971
As I'm a costly man!

742
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:02,081
Shit! It's an insult.

743
00:57:02,786 --> 00:57:05,588
I'm going to take a risky job.

744
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:06,623
Did you think that?

745
00:57:06,623 --> 00:57:07,957
If so...

746
00:57:07,957 --> 00:57:11,188
You'd have not shown me
this money.

747
00:57:15,632 --> 00:57:17,000
Car key is okay.

748
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,059
But it is not enough.

749
00:57:19,636 --> 00:57:22,161
What? Ring exchange?

750
00:57:30,847 --> 00:57:32,508
This is not okay.

751
00:57:33,216 --> 00:57:34,478
What else?

752
00:57:44,227 --> 00:57:46,629
Papa! Is this nice?

753
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,153
Nice!

754
00:57:52,735 --> 00:57:55,238
Papa! Why is this?

755
00:57:55,238 --> 00:57:56,569
I'll get you another one.

756
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:09,180
Take everything of us.

757
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:25,795
Do you want to see your mom?

758
00:58:27,303 --> 00:58:29,635
I also never had seen my mom.

759
00:58:32,242 --> 00:58:33,209
You can see her.

760
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:35,678
I'll show her to you.

761
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:37,043
Promise?

762
00:58:46,322 --> 00:58:49,291
Jai! What do you say?

763
00:58:56,299 --> 00:58:58,233
I don't like this.

764
00:58:59,269 --> 00:59:02,204
We have no other go except it.

765
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:12,107
I... Meenu! -Nothing is sure for me.

766
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:17,048
You'd not die here.

767
00:59:21,257 --> 00:59:22,747
If we get anything...

768
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:28,223
I thought of it deeply.

769
00:59:30,133 --> 00:59:32,624
When Feroz is also left...

770
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:36,261
We did many things
to live together.

771
00:59:38,274 --> 00:59:41,243
This too...

772
00:59:49,686 --> 00:59:51,287
Irene was locked alone

773
00:59:51,287 --> 00:59:52,276
...inside the castle.

774
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:55,024
It was so dark and terrifying.

775
00:59:55,024 --> 00:59:57,360
She sat gazing at the dark clouds.

776
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,590
Waiting for her saviour.

777
01:00:00,396 --> 01:00:03,166
Did Saviour save Irene. papa?

778
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:06,703
Then? Prince saved Irene.

779
01:00:06,703 --> 01:00:08,938
As a cute little baby.

780
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:12,175
They went flying up on horses.

781
01:00:12,175 --> 01:00:14,643
Sure? -Sure!

782
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:16,746
Dear! You lay down.

783
01:00:16,746 --> 01:00:17,847
You got your school tomorrow.

784
01:00:17,847 --> 01:00:18,915
Sleep like a good girl.

785
01:00:18,915 --> 01:00:20,283
Balance story is tomorrow. Okay?

786
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:22,952
Close your eyes.

787
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:25,250
Good girl!

788
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,287
Do you know what is this?

789
01:00:38,034 --> 01:00:39,126
Uganda!

790
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:42,068
Uganda map.

791
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:45,240
Hey! Throw your phone in water 1st.

792
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:47,772
You want to shoot a film. Right?

793
01:00:47,944 --> 01:00:49,912
This plan will be too interesting.

794
01:00:50,847 --> 01:00:51,814
For this plan...

795
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:54,217
Sorry! In your language...

796
01:00:54,217 --> 01:00:55,284
For this film...

797
01:00:55,284 --> 01:00:56,342
I’ve fixed the title too.

798
01:00:56,419 --> 01:01:00,150
Escape from Uganda.

799
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:03,114
It's too good, isn't it?

800
01:01:04,293 --> 01:01:06,362
A strange expression.

801
01:01:06,362 --> 01:01:07,296
Okay.

802
01:01:07,296 --> 01:01:10,299
It's Kampala city, Uganda's capital.

803
01:01:10,299 --> 01:01:12,101
In 11 k.m South from here...

804
01:01:12,101 --> 01:01:13,302
Mekova division.

805
01:01:13,302 --> 01:01:15,138
Lucida is there only.

806
01:01:15,138 --> 01:01:17,073
The maximum security prison.

807
01:01:17,073 --> 01:01:18,841
Butapica in North.

808
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:20,243
Pamnga in West.

809
01:01:20,243 --> 01:01:21,210
M is silent there.

810
01:01:21,978 --> 01:01:22,979
Boat bell in South.

811
01:01:22,979 --> 01:01:24,714
Lake Victoria in East.

812
01:01:24,714 --> 01:01:28,251
Nearest Entebe International Airport.

813
01:01:28,251 --> 01:01:29,452
In that airport...

814
01:01:29,452 --> 01:01:32,255
A superb figure named Petricia...

815
01:01:32,255 --> 01:01:33,056
Leave it.

816
01:01:33,056 --> 01:01:33,756
Wrong time.

817
01:01:33,756 --> 01:01:35,291
In Boat bell about what I told...

818
01:01:35,291 --> 01:01:35,892
Shipyard.

819
01:01:35,892 --> 01:01:38,861
From here Kenya, Tanzania, Moanza...

820
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:41,921
Passenger and cargo traffic are there.

821
01:01:42,265 --> 01:01:44,467
So one matter is very clear.

822
01:01:44,467 --> 01:01:46,035
In front of us...

823
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:49,698
All options. By road. rail, air and ship.

824
01:01:50,273 --> 01:01:52,942
This is our play ground.

825
01:01:52,942 --> 01:01:54,377
Such a great plan...

826
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:56,312
Uganda President too can't design.

827
01:01:56,312 --> 01:01:57,370
Why?

828
01:01:58,281 --> 01:02:01,216
Because his wife is not in jail.

829
01:02:01,417 --> 01:02:02,852
What's next?

830
01:02:02,852 --> 01:02:05,188
Okay. An important matter is...

831
01:02:05,188 --> 01:02:07,290
After saving your wife from jail only.

832
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:08,157
These will be useful.

833
01:02:08,157 --> 01:02:09,959
I got another plan for that.

834
01:02:09,959 --> 01:02:10,426
Oh no!

835
01:02:10,426 --> 01:02:11,294
What happened?

836
01:02:11,294 --> 01:02:12,295
I forgot to pick up my daughter.

837
01:02:12,295 --> 01:02:14,422
Proceed. -I call you back.

838
01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:19,234
He missed his baby in saving his wife.

839
01:02:29,212 --> 01:02:30,279
Excuse me.

840
01:02:30,279 --> 01:02:31,871
Yes.

841
01:02:32,882 --> 01:02:34,150
Can I help you?

842
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:36,285
My daughter Meenakshi Jaikrishnan.

843
01:02:36,285 --> 01:02:37,453
All students has gone.

844
01:02:37,453 --> 01:02:38,988
I'm her father.

845
01:02:38,988 --> 01:02:40,189
I got late to reach.

846
01:02:40,189 --> 01:02:41,324
Can you find out
who picked her up?

847
01:02:41,324 --> 01:02:43,059
Let me check at the register.

848
01:02:43,059 --> 01:02:44,127
Thank you. Please.

849
01:02:44,127 --> 01:02:45,253
Come here.

850
01:02:51,467 --> 01:02:53,298
Hello, ma'am.

I'm Richard Kachamu have hold on.

852
01:02:57,106 --> 01:02:58,869
I did you know? Okay!

853
01:03:00,877 --> 01:03:02,276
Catherine? -Yeah.

854
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:04,810
Okay! Thanks.

855
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:07,279
Come on take me now.

856
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:17,894
Hi, Catherine!

857
01:03:17,894 --> 01:03:18,294
Meenu!

858
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:20,062
I waited at school for awhile.

859
01:03:20,062 --> 01:03:21,197
Since you didn't turn up.

860
01:03:21,197 --> 01:03:22,231
I picked Meenu.

861
01:03:22,231 --> 01:03:23,900
Why was your phone switched off?

862
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:26,198
I'm sorry. I was busy in meeting.

863
01:03:26,536 --> 01:03:28,504
Dear! Papa!

864
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:30,506
Shall we go?

865
01:03:30,506 --> 01:03:32,308
Let's play for sometime and go.

866
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:34,477
I promised they can play after food.

867
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:36,245
I'm so sorry, Catherine.

868
01:03:36,245 --> 01:03:37,880
I'm in a hurry today.

869
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:39,279
I got some work, dear.

870
01:03:40,049 --> 01:03:41,551
But I'll send her home sometime.

871
01:03:41,551 --> 01:03:43,319
Okay. -Thank you.

872
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:44,353
Shall we go?

873
01:03:44,353 --> 01:03:45,321
Come.

874
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:46,345
Bye, Sam!

875
01:03:51,127 --> 01:03:53,162
This is Lusira prison.

876
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:54,993
Place, where 20000 inmates are there.

877
01:03:55,598 --> 01:03:58,267
Going to kidnap your Shika from here.

878
01:03:58,267 --> 01:04:00,970
There will be strong security.

879
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:02,205
Breaking all those...

880
01:04:02,205 --> 01:04:03,472
Can you reach inside?

881
01:04:03,472 --> 01:04:05,497
No need. Do a thing.

882
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:08,244
Go in front of that jail...

883
01:04:08,244 --> 01:04:10,546
Give a missed call from your mobile.

884
01:04:10,546 --> 01:04:12,315
Your Mrs will run out.

885
01:04:12,315 --> 01:04:14,383
She'll kiss in your lips. Go.

886
01:04:14,383 --> 01:04:16,285
Antony! Talk seriously.

887
01:04:16,285 --> 01:04:17,587
I won't be serious in lCU too.

888
01:04:17,587 --> 01:04:20,089
If you talk seriously to me...

889
01:04:20,089 --> 01:04:21,023
Look!

890
01:04:21,023 --> 01:04:23,125
This is Toyota C3100.

891
01:04:23,125 --> 01:04:25,252
Track that supplies medicine there.

892
01:04:25,328 --> 01:04:27,129
Don't bend and strain yourself.

893
01:04:27,129 --> 01:04:28,596
See this carefully.

894
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:33,002
That track will get in and come.

895
01:04:33,002 --> 01:04:34,902
Once for 36 hours.

896
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:39,575
If it gets in at 8 o'clock on Sunday...

897
01:04:39,575 --> 01:04:41,344
After 36 hours.

898
01:04:41,344 --> 01:04:44,108
It'll get in again at 8 o'clock on Monday.

899
01:04:45,314 --> 01:04:46,349
If it is missed...

900
01:04:46,349 --> 01:04:49,252
Next at 8 o'clock on
Wednesday morning.

901
01:04:49,252 --> 01:04:51,243
It won't go in between.

902
01:04:56,459 --> 01:04:58,361
Watched Vijay and Ajith movies?

903
01:04:58,361 --> 01:05:00,630
Unbelievable. But interesting.

904
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:02,097
This will be like that.

905
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:06,934
What about you say, man?

906
01:05:07,603 --> 01:05:09,405
From where did you get him?

907
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:11,305
He didn't find any other goto die.

908
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:13,976
Oh shit! Hey man!

909
01:05:13,976 --> 01:05:15,378
He doesn't need your help.

910
01:05:15,378 --> 01:05:17,213
You don't have to believe him.

911
01:05:17,213 --> 01:05:18,948
He's not in a sense.

912
01:05:18,948 --> 01:05:19,649
Okay?

913
01:05:19,649 --> 01:05:22,184
Speak in Malayalam.

914
01:05:22,184 --> 01:05:22,548
I understand.

915
01:05:23,986 --> 01:05:25,476
Who is he? -Tamil man!

916
01:05:26,355 --> 01:05:29,458
Both have joined to kill a girl.

917
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:31,594
What do you think?

918
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:34,363
Is an architect, a worker?

919
01:05:34,363 --> 01:05:36,365
Did you hear about ldi Amin?

920
01:05:36,365 --> 01:05:38,629
Heard about Oboto and Naren?

921
01:05:39,468 --> 01:05:41,237
You've planned to kidnap from jail.

922
01:05:41,237 --> 01:05:44,941
Uganda police is not so cheap like others.

923
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:45,574
To kidnap her easily.

924
01:05:45,574 --> 01:05:46,409
Understand?

925
01:05:46,409 --> 01:05:49,378
Enough. Don't act too much.

926
01:05:49,378 --> 01:05:51,346
You don't have any other go.

927
01:05:52,214 --> 01:05:53,416
Knowing our plan...

928
01:05:53,416 --> 01:05:55,217
If you don't help us...

929
01:05:55,217 --> 01:05:58,187
Hey! I'll chop you like this.

930
01:05:58,187 --> 01:05:59,484
I'll dry you in the sunlight.

931
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:02,653
Buddy! He's threatening me. Right?

932
01:06:02,992 --> 01:06:04,560
Hello, Architect!

933
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:05,995
Deal or no deal?

934
01:06:05,995 --> 01:06:08,431
If it is deal, you're safe in this game.

935
01:06:08,431 --> 01:06:11,367
No deal means,
your box is in my hand.

936
01:06:11,367 --> 01:06:13,436
If you have brain, think of it.

937
01:06:13,436 --> 01:06:14,368
Are you satisfied?

938
01:06:18,341 --> 01:06:21,577
Uganda! Ruanda! Barudi.

939
01:06:21,577 --> 01:06:25,343
Hey! Will this take place?

940
01:06:26,382 --> 01:06:28,551
Hey! You paid him fully. Right?

941
01:06:28,551 --> 01:06:30,252
What else can I do?

942
01:06:30,252 --> 01:06:32,221
If he doesn't do this getting money...

943
01:06:32,221 --> 01:06:34,348
You'd give money for any reason.

944
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:35,458
You'd give.

945
01:06:35,458 --> 01:06:38,361
Why should we have it? Right?

946
01:06:38,361 --> 01:06:39,562
Oh! Come.

947
01:06:39,562 --> 01:06:42,429
Hey! Your future is in this plan.

948
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:47,335
This is Shika's cell.

949
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:51,374
It's women's block in Lucira prison.

950
01:06:51,374 --> 01:06:54,810
Kidnapping a person from here secretly is...

951
01:06:54,810 --> 01:06:56,379
It's impossible.

952
01:06:56,379 --> 01:06:58,748
Did you hear it?

953
01:06:58,748 --> 01:07:00,383
Sir’s words are true.

954
01:07:00,383 --> 01:07:02,451
Hey! Stop your plan today itself.

955
01:07:02,451 --> 01:07:03,645
Sir! Give me your hand.

956
01:07:04,587 --> 01:07:06,714
Sit down! Sit, man.

957
01:07:11,727 --> 01:07:14,355
This is jail's infirmary.

958
01:07:15,831 --> 01:07:18,834
Aids patients are
admitted there mostly.

959
01:07:18,834 --> 01:07:20,736
We'd bring Shika there only.

960
01:07:20,736 --> 01:07:22,405
I'll take care of it.

961
01:07:22,405 --> 01:07:23,339
In that jail...

962
01:07:23,339 --> 01:07:24,607
Once for 6 months...

963
01:07:24,607 --> 01:07:25,641
Water tank will be cleaned.

964
01:07:25,641 --> 01:07:28,077
Water tank will be empty on that day.

965
01:07:28,077 --> 01:07:30,713
That water pipe is our escape route.

966
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:32,782
Day, when the cleaning will happen...

967
01:07:32,782 --> 01:07:34,374
April 24th.

968
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:42,147
Only7 days for April 24th.

969
01:07:43,292 --> 01:07:45,394
7 days means, before that...

970
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:48,097
Or we’d wait for 6 more months.

971
01:07:48,097 --> 01:07:51,167
Can Shika be alive until then?

972
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:52,401
No?

973
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:54,403
So we have to act fast.

974
01:07:54,403 --> 01:07:58,207
I know a girl in that jail.

975
01:07:58,207 --> 01:07:59,367
I too.

976
01:08:00,609 --> 01:08:03,635
His wife. -Listen to me, man.

977
01:08:04,313 --> 01:08:06,247
You got moustache into your mouth.

978
01:08:08,217 --> 01:08:09,718
Her name is Ruth.

979
01:08:09,718 --> 01:08:12,380
She's in this jail from the past 8 yrs.

980
01:08:15,624 --> 01:08:18,360
Her anger with her.

981
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:22,387
She's our trump card
in this operation.

982
01:08:23,132 --> 01:08:25,434
There's another side for this jail.

983
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:31,805
Way, where illegal supply goes to rich people.

984
01:08:32,441 --> 01:08:39,615
They supply illegal items by this route.

985
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:41,417
Previous day of our escape plan...

986
01:08:41,417 --> 01:08:42,418
In the same route...

987
01:08:42,418 --> 01:08:43,452
Alprox named medicine...

988
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:44,854
Informers supply.

989
01:08:44,854 --> 01:08:48,357
To control violent prisoners...

990
01:08:48,357 --> 01:08:49,258
That medicine is used.

991
01:08:49,258 --> 01:08:50,726
If we inject that...

992
01:08:50,726 --> 01:08:54,430
Shika will be unconscious for 30 mins.

993
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:55,564
Antony!

994
01:08:55,564 --> 01:08:59,802
Yes. Until we get detailed lab report...

995
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:02,538
Doctors too can't trace that medicine.

996
01:09:02,538 --> 01:09:05,508
We'd use those 30 mins only.

997
01:09:05,508 --> 01:09:06,406
You got it?

998
01:09:07,376 --> 01:09:08,400
Understand?

999
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:10,244
Do you understand?

1000
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:12,140
That's enough.

1001
01:09:56,458 --> 01:09:57,425
Yes.

1002
01:09:58,494 --> 01:09:59,562
I'm inspector Morize.

1003
01:09:59,562 --> 01:10:00,963
Yes.

1004
01:10:00,963 --> 01:10:02,794
Uganda police. -Yeah.

1005
01:10:06,769 --> 01:10:08,430
Police!

1006
01:10:09,471 --> 01:10:11,302
Our plan...

1007
01:10:12,975 --> 01:10:14,465
Why did police come here?

1008
01:10:17,446 --> 01:10:18,572
JK!

1009
01:10:20,416 --> 01:10:22,284
He came for Ferozki's murder enquiry.

1010
01:10:22,284 --> 01:10:23,953
He asked me about Carlos Kennedy.

1011
01:10:23,953 --> 01:10:24,653
Carlos Kennedy?

1012
01:10:24,653 --> 01:10:26,755
He's a notorious criminal.

1013
01:10:26,755 --> 01:10:27,656
You know him. Right?

1014
01:10:27,656 --> 01:10:28,891
Why? Do you know him?

1015
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:31,416
To me? Police too don't know him.

1016
01:10:31,794 --> 01:10:33,963
Didn't you hear
about international Don?

1017
01:10:33,963 --> 01:10:35,331
He's that person.

1018
01:10:35,331 --> 01:10:39,301
If Carlos Kennedy killed your lawyer...

1019
01:10:39,301 --> 01:10:42,634
He may be Mayor's man definitely.

1020
01:10:44,473 --> 01:10:46,964
Everything is lost.

1021
01:10:47,943 --> 01:10:48,466
JK!

1022
01:10:49,478 --> 01:10:53,505
Our enemies are too powerful.

1023
01:10:54,016 --> 01:10:56,852
This place is not so safe hereafter.

1024
01:10:56,852 --> 01:10:58,843
We have to be more careful.

1025
01:11:45,567 --> 01:11:48,470
Factory that makes medicine for jail.

1026
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:49,437
It's that factory's lD card.

1027
01:11:49,772 --> 01:11:52,308
So that’s the end of our game.

1028
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:53,609
According to us...

1029
01:11:53,609 --> 01:11:54,910
Our plan may be perfect.

1030
01:11:54,910 --> 01:11:57,046
But its chances...

1031
01:11:57,046 --> 01:11:58,514
Just 50-50 only.

1032
01:11:58,514 --> 01:11:59,882
What you do is...

1033
01:11:59,882 --> 01:12:03,352
In truck, which goes
to jail at 8 o'clock...

1034
01:12:03,352 --> 01:12:04,320
You'd get into that.

1035
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,955
If they suspect in parking...

1036
01:12:06,955 --> 01:12:07,979
They won’t doubt you.

1037
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:09,348
If you have this lD card.

1038
01:12:09,425 --> 01:12:11,727
500 workers are in that factory.

1039
01:12:11,727 --> 01:12:12,995
Most are Sardarjis there.

1040
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:14,396
So they won't doubt you.

1041
01:12:14,396 --> 01:12:16,364
Then... He, who should go really?

1042
01:12:17,866 --> 01:12:20,664
He'll be a patient in St.Pruno hospital.

1043
01:12:21,704 --> 01:12:22,938
Are you scared?

1044
01:12:22,938 --> 01:12:28,477
You went and told her father your love.

1045
01:12:28,477 --> 01:12:30,479
You don't such a great guts.

1046
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:32,881
In case if police arrests you...

1047
01:12:32,881 --> 01:12:34,116
You don't worry.

1048
01:12:34,116 --> 01:12:36,380
Tell his name bravely.

1049
01:12:41,423 --> 01:12:42,447
Lights off!

1050
01:12:44,493 --> 01:12:45,460
All lights off.

1051
01:13:14,857 --> 01:13:17,792
Cut the medicines.

1052
01:13:35,544 --> 01:13:36,779
Morning, sir.

1053
01:13:36,779 --> 01:13:38,440
Please see this urgently.

1054
01:14:04,173 --> 01:14:05,470
Who the hell is she?

1055
01:14:27,529 --> 01:14:28,564
Stop it!

1056
01:14:28,564 --> 01:14:30,464
Stop it!

1057
01:14:36,505 --> 01:14:38,474
You may not to you respect me.

1058
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:40,843
You must not ask my permission.

1059
01:14:40,843 --> 01:14:42,640
Lift her.

1060
01:14:46,515 --> 01:14:47,916
Open your eyes.

1061
01:14:47,916 --> 01:14:49,885
I will give you the last chance.

1062
01:14:49,885 --> 01:14:52,521
why did you got him?

1063
01:14:52,521 --> 01:14:54,489
Why?

1064
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:05,534
Leave her.

1065
01:15:05,534 --> 01:15:08,503
No food for 3 days.

1066
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:52,648
In that infirmary...

1067
01:15:52,648 --> 01:15:54,049
Waste syringe...

1068
01:15:54,049 --> 01:15:55,651
...disposable machine is there.

1069
01:15:55,651 --> 01:15:57,553
As it is out of order...

1070
01:15:57,553 --> 01:15:58,954
That machine is not there now.

1071
01:15:58,954 --> 01:16:01,123
There's an exit spot.

1072
01:16:01,123 --> 01:16:02,591
If I enter through that..

1073
01:16:02,591 --> 01:16:04,826
There will be a big waste tank.

1074
01:16:04,826 --> 01:16:06,862
As there’s no water supply...

1075
01:16:06,862 --> 01:16:08,664
Escaping in that route is...

1076
01:16:08,664 --> 01:16:09,323
Safe!

1077
01:17:25,374 --> 01:17:28,104
After saving Shika from jail...

1078
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:30,143
We have limited time.

1079
01:17:30,979 --> 01:17:32,280
Within 2 hours...

1080
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:35,350
Police will get all your details.

1081
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:37,285
Including the airport.

1082
01:17:37,285 --> 01:17:39,845
So each and every second
is important.

1083
01:17:40,422 --> 01:17:43,289
You're going to get into MS24.

1084
01:17:43,892 --> 01:17:46,061
I've set up everything into it.

1085
01:17:46,061 --> 01:17:48,397
It's enough if we kidnap its driver.

1086
01:17:48,397 --> 01:17:51,093
I'm going to do that only now.

1087
01:17:52,401 --> 01:17:57,372
"Escape!"

1088
01:17:57,372 --> 01:17:58,999
Who the hell...

1089
01:20:04,399 --> 01:20:06,060
Help!

1090
01:20:07,602 --> 01:20:09,263
Help!

1091
01:20:11,173 --> 01:20:12,834
Help!

1092
01:20:24,486 --> 01:20:25,921
Oh my god!

1093
01:20:25,921 --> 01:20:27,183
Girls!

1094
01:20:32,394 --> 01:20:34,055
Show me your lD.

1095
01:20:41,436 --> 01:20:42,270
Okay!

1096
01:20:42,270 --> 01:20:43,362
You go.

1097
01:21:00,989 --> 01:21:02,581
Good morning, sir. -Morning.

1098
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:13,264
Sign here.

1099
01:21:16,338 --> 01:21:17,439
Thank you.

1100
01:21:17,439 --> 01:21:18,406
Okay!

1101
01:24:40,475 --> 01:24:41,464
Shit!

1102
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:46,172
Shit!

1103
01:25:37,365 --> 01:25:38,933
Shika! Shika!

1104
01:25:38,933 --> 01:25:42,437
Shika! You come out.

1105
01:25:42,437 --> 01:25:42,904
I've come out.

1106
01:25:42,904 --> 01:25:45,206
I'm here outside with the van.

1107
01:25:45,206 --> 01:25:45,607
Check for it.

1108
01:25:45,607 --> 01:25:47,208
Look around there.

1109
01:25:47,208 --> 01:25:51,412
Can you find it, Shika?

1110
01:25:51,412 --> 01:25:52,572
Thank God!

1111
01:30:21,883 --> 01:30:23,544
Shika! Shika!

1112
01:30:32,593 --> 01:30:33,491
Shika!

1113
01:30:35,596 --> 01:30:38,463
Shika! Run!

1114
01:30:44,839 --> 01:30:45,567
Shika! Fast!

1115
01:30:54,816 --> 01:30:56,545
Are you sure about that?

1116
01:30:57,518 --> 01:30:57,985
Okay!

1117
01:30:57,985 --> 01:31:00,545
Keep on trying. Don't lose them.

1118
01:31:04,592 --> 01:31:05,991
You can come in now.

1119
01:31:07,595 --> 01:31:09,563
Shika! Are you fine?

1120
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,503
We got only 2 hours maximum.

1121
01:31:15,503 --> 01:31:16,604
Mr. Makesi!

1122
01:31:16,604 --> 01:31:18,005
Pars the information to all points.

1123
01:31:18,005 --> 01:31:19,207
Put on APB.

1124
01:31:19,207 --> 01:31:20,875
Arrange for more back up at sector 4.

1125
01:31:20,875 --> 01:31:22,510
Sir! I'll take care.

1126
01:31:22,510 --> 01:31:23,611
We will join them on the trial.

1127
01:31:23,611 --> 01:31:24,578
No!

1128
01:31:25,079 --> 01:31:26,569
We have work to do.

1129
01:31:43,598 --> 01:31:44,189
Shit!

1130
01:31:46,033 --> 01:31:46,761
Oh god!

1131
01:31:48,703 --> 01:31:49,837
Drive fast!

1132
01:31:49,837 --> 01:31:52,169
Fast! Fast!

1133
01:32:22,637 --> 01:32:24,969
Police! J! Shit!

1134
01:32:29,610 --> 01:32:30,235
He is there.

1135
01:32:41,322 --> 01:32:42,289
Oh shit!

1136
01:32:46,661 --> 01:32:48,563
Which way should I go?

1137
01:32:48,563 --> 01:32:49,797
I lost the break. -Hey!

1138
01:32:49,797 --> 01:32:51,632
Van comes in reverse. Careful!

1139
01:32:51,632 --> 01:32:53,167
Got the damn break.

1140
01:32:53,167 --> 01:32:54,769
J! I'm okay. I'm coming.

1141
01:32:54,769 --> 01:32:56,600
Okay. Come!

1142
01:33:17,658 --> 01:33:20,328
Sir! I've got the information.

1143
01:33:20,328 --> 01:33:21,796
Who is in pursuit?

1144
01:33:21,796 --> 01:33:23,664
David Blake. The jailor!

1145
01:33:23,664 --> 01:33:26,758
Okay. I'll deal with him.

1146
01:33:59,634 --> 01:34:00,623
Fast!

1147
01:35:13,407 --> 01:35:15,342
Yes, Mr. Mayor!

1148
01:35:15,342 --> 01:35:16,177
I'm on trail.

1149
01:35:16,177 --> 01:35:18,079
In no time, they will be in my hands.

1150
01:35:18,079 --> 01:35:20,181
Make sure. I want them alive.

1151
01:35:20,181 --> 01:35:21,808
Don't make any mistakes.

1152
01:35:33,761 --> 01:35:36,457
Which way? -This way.

1153
01:35:37,865 --> 01:35:39,162
Go. -Okay!

1154
01:36:08,996 --> 01:36:10,122
Arrange it!

1155
01:36:55,109 --> 01:36:56,510
Yeah. -Yeah.

1156
01:36:56,510 --> 01:36:58,512
Look around there. Over!

1157
01:36:58,512 --> 01:37:02,471
Police will be in our next move.

1158
01:37:07,188 --> 01:37:08,989
Call him.

1159
01:37:08,989 --> 01:37:12,493
Hey! Come here.

1160
01:37:12,493 --> 01:37:13,482
Hey man!

1161
01:37:58,539 --> 01:37:59,673
Hello, Catherine!

1162
01:37:59,673 --> 01:38:04,044
Meenu? In church?

1163
01:38:04,044 --> 01:38:06,911
Go fast. -Okay.

1164
01:38:26,333 --> 01:38:28,096
Antony!

1165
01:38:36,043 --> 01:38:36,977
Where is Meenu?

1166
01:38:36,977 --> 01:38:37,500
Jai!

1167
01:38:39,947 --> 01:38:44,680
He's the killer.

1168
01:38:46,553 --> 01:38:48,987
Angel Mathew!

1169
01:39:06,106 --> 01:39:08,142
Not only Angel.

1170
01:39:08,142 --> 01:39:13,180
I only killed Mayor's daughter too.

1171
01:39:13,180 --> 01:39:17,514
I'm CK. Carglos Kennedy!

1172
01:39:22,456 --> 01:39:24,291
Diamonds are forever.

1173
01:39:24,291 --> 01:39:26,555
Where are those diamonds?

1174
01:39:27,561 --> 01:39:28,729
What do you say?

1175
01:39:28,729 --> 01:39:30,390
What diamonds?

1176
01:39:38,005 --> 01:39:40,240
She might have understood it.

1177
01:39:40,240 --> 01:39:42,367
What, Shika? Right or wrong?

1178
01:39:48,482 --> 01:39:50,117
In diamond smuggling...

1179
01:39:50,117 --> 01:39:51,518
Angel and Audra...

1180
01:39:51,518 --> 01:39:53,420
They were working for me only.

1181
01:39:53,420 --> 01:39:56,023
But they cheated me...

1182
01:39:56,023 --> 01:39:58,389
And planned to rob those diamonds.

1183
01:40:03,564 --> 01:40:06,266
9.25 million dollars.

1184
01:40:06,266 --> 01:40:08,569
If females are so dare...

1185
01:40:08,569 --> 01:40:10,571
How dare a male may be!

1186
01:40:10,571 --> 01:40:13,440
Only gun and 2 bullets.

1187
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:15,309
I killed them.

1188
01:40:15,309 --> 01:40:17,578
I understood after that...

1189
01:40:17,578 --> 01:40:19,546
Diamonds, they gave me...

1190
01:40:19,546 --> 01:40:20,513
...were fake.

1191
01:40:21,582 --> 01:40:24,551
Police arrested Shika for that murder.

1192
01:40:24,551 --> 01:40:26,520
If you went there on that night means...

1193
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:29,223
About those original diamonds...

1194
01:40:29,223 --> 01:40:30,657
You may know it.

1195
01:40:30,657 --> 01:40:34,294
JK! Shika only knows that.

1196
01:40:34,294 --> 01:40:36,397
About those original diamonds.

1197
01:40:36,397 --> 01:40:39,400
So I decided to help you.

1198
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:40,667
You help me.

1199
01:40:40,667 --> 01:40:42,760
So everything is clear now.

1200
01:40:44,138 --> 01:40:46,299
Tell me. Where are those diamonds?

1201
01:40:48,042 --> 01:40:51,341
Or... Your child is with me.

1202
01:40:52,579 --> 01:40:54,342
I'll send her to Angel.

1203
01:40:56,650 --> 01:40:58,085
How is your convenience?

1204
01:40:58,085 --> 01:40:59,486
What did you decide?

1205
01:40:59,486 --> 01:41:01,522
Shika! Tell me fast.

1206
01:41:01,522 --> 01:41:03,547
You’ve to escape from Uganda. Right?

1207
01:41:04,691 --> 01:41:06,556
So let me come praying.

1208
01:41:07,628 --> 01:41:09,562
For our Meenu.

1209
01:41:18,238 --> 01:41:20,536
It's enough if you say me.

1210
01:41:24,578 --> 01:41:26,213
When Angel told me...

1211
01:41:26,213 --> 01:41:29,216
I knew that I got diamonds.

1212
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:31,752
Shika! Don't trust anyone.

1213
01:41:31,752 --> 01:41:34,721
All... Sorry.

1214
01:41:37,224 --> 01:41:39,317
When I got to bear those in jail...

1215
01:41:41,128 --> 01:41:44,757
I knew as you both would be safe outside.

1216
01:41:49,603 --> 01:41:51,161
This piece is missing.

1217
01:41:51,672 --> 01:41:54,241
Let's find this.

1218
01:41:54,241 --> 01:41:55,609
As of this map...

1219
01:41:55,609 --> 01:41:57,778
This look like to be international airport.

1220
01:41:57,778 --> 01:41:59,279
Let's have to go.

1221
01:41:59,279 --> 01:41:59,813
Let's go.

1222
01:41:59,813 --> 01:42:00,177
Let's go.

1223
01:42:01,248 --> 01:42:03,150
You'd escape from here.

1224
01:42:03,150 --> 01:42:04,318
That's necessary for me too.

1225
01:42:04,318 --> 01:42:05,819
So go ad wait at the airport.

1226
01:42:05,819 --> 01:42:07,688
when I get those diamonds...

1227
01:42:07,688 --> 01:42:09,590
You'll get your Meenu at that time.

1228
01:42:09,590 --> 01:42:13,160
Drawing room. Great teddy bear.

1229
01:42:13,160 --> 01:42:14,495
Right, Shika?

1230
01:42:14,495 --> 01:42:17,555
You got an admiring eyes.

1231
01:42:25,205 --> 01:42:28,174
Jai! Daughter? Nothing will happen.

1232
01:42:29,910 --> 01:42:30,777
I knew.

1233
01:42:30,777 --> 01:42:32,613
I knew he was Carlos Kennedy.

1234
01:42:32,613 --> 01:42:33,847
Inspector Morize.

1235
01:42:33,847 --> 01:42:35,212
Uganda police.

1236
01:42:38,919 --> 01:42:40,147
You know this man?

1237
01:42:40,721 --> 01:42:42,523
Is he Carlos Kennedy?

1238
01:42:42,523 --> 01:42:45,692
He only can bring out Shika.

1239
01:42:45,692 --> 01:42:48,729
Carlos plan until Shika
comes out from jail.

1240
01:42:48,729 --> 01:42:51,493
Our plan after that.

1241
01:42:52,866 --> 01:42:54,601
Did you know this already?

1242
01:42:54,601 --> 01:42:55,602
Shika! Trust me.

1243
01:42:55,602 --> 01:42:56,603
You get into the car.

1244
01:42:56,603 --> 01:42:57,661
Please!

1245
01:42:59,406 --> 01:43:01,341
Gauthem! -Tell me.

1246
01:43:01,341 --> 01:43:02,676
Everything is as we thought.

1247
01:43:02,676 --> 01:43:04,541
But Catherine became her person.

1248
01:43:04,745 --> 01:43:05,612
Shit!

1249
01:43:05,612 --> 01:43:06,847
We'd redeem Meenu from him fast.

1250
01:43:06,847 --> 01:43:09,216
You only told Catherine to pick her.

1251
01:43:09,216 --> 01:43:10,484
Call him now. - Do a thing.

1252
01:43:10,484 --> 01:43:12,918
You leave. I'll be there.

1253
01:43:14,621 --> 01:43:15,588
Go fast!

1254
01:43:26,466 --> 01:43:30,470
Hey! You said diamonds are into the doll.

1255
01:43:30,470 --> 01:43:32,406
Which doll? I'm sorry.

1256
01:43:32,406 --> 01:43:35,609
Carlos! You can't those diamonds.

1257
01:43:35,609 --> 01:43:37,600
Hey cheat!

1258
01:43:41,415 --> 01:43:46,409
What,man? Cheating me?

1259
01:43:48,288 --> 01:43:50,624
Your child is under my custody now.

1260
01:43:50,624 --> 01:43:51,792
Under my custody.

1261
01:43:51,792 --> 01:43:55,662
Ask your Catherine, then.

1262
01:43:55,662 --> 01:43:57,464
As where is my Meenu!

1263
01:43:57,464 --> 01:43:58,590
She is under my custody now.

1264
01:43:58,966 --> 01:44:00,000
Don't you know that?

1265
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,269
Leave us, Carlos.

1266
01:44:02,269 --> 01:44:03,702
Bye forever!

1267
01:44:16,350 --> 01:44:17,651
I know this man.

1268
01:44:17,651 --> 01:44:19,312
I may need your help.

1269
01:44:22,489 --> 01:44:24,658
Enough. They rest in Lucira.

1270
01:44:24,658 --> 01:44:27,761
Okay. Can I have a cigarette?

1271
01:44:27,761 --> 01:44:29,661
Please.

1272
01:44:41,375 --> 01:44:43,843
Give me the list of all Indian passengers.

1273
01:45:12,472 --> 01:45:15,609
Isn't it? Jai! Our daughter?

1274
01:45:15,609 --> 01:45:16,576
Yeah.

1275
01:45:40,867 --> 01:45:41,697
Go!

1276
01:45:46,873 --> 01:45:49,501
Mummy!

1277
01:46:57,711 --> 01:46:58,912
Thanks!

1278
01:46:58,912 --> 01:47:01,214
What, dear? Thanks, man.

1279
01:47:01,214 --> 01:47:01,848
Thanks.

1280
01:47:01,848 --> 01:47:02,473
Thanks.

1281
01:47:03,717 --> 01:47:06,219
Shika! You go.

1282
01:47:06,219 --> 01:47:08,755
Go! Go!

1283
01:47:08,755 --> 01:47:11,656
Run now. Run. -Hey Shika!

1284
01:47:12,559 --> 01:47:14,761
Mr.Pratap will call you in Nairobi.

1285
01:47:14,761 --> 01:47:16,229
Go. -Flight is ready.

1286
01:47:16,229 --> 01:47:18,094
Shit!

1287
01:47:30,577 --> 01:47:31,874
Go!

1288
01:47:34,948 --> 01:47:36,973
Shika!

1289
01:47:45,258 --> 01:47:48,694
Come. Let's escape.

1290
01:47:51,898 --> 01:47:53,229
Shika!

1291
01:47:56,736 --> 01:47:58,638
Go!

1292
01:47:58,638 --> 01:48:00,936
Shika!

1293
01:49:54,054 --> 01:49:55,722
Plane is started.

1294
01:49:55,722 --> 01:49:57,257
If they come, they will get caught.

1295
01:49:57,257 --> 01:49:58,725
Tell your Mayor

1296
01:49:58,725 --> 01:50:00,693
...they are escaped from Uganda.

1297
01:50:14,741 --> 01:50:16,343
This piece is missing.

1298
01:50:16,343 --> 01:50:18,834
Let's find this.

1299
01:50:37,964 --> 01:50:42,235
Hey beauty! I saw you.

1300
01:50:42,235 --> 01:50:47,639
Oh beauty! I'm there for you.

1301
01:50:48,875 --> 01:50:53,747
Your wish on love, is enough.

1302
01:50:53,747 --> 01:50:56,316
Hey snowfall!

1303
01:50:56,316 --> 01:50:59,308
Are you my lovable wish, girl?

1304
01:51:09,763 --> 01:51:15,268
Oh sea! I followed a pretty girl.

1305
01:51:15,268 --> 01:51:18,772
I followed you, my beauty!

1306
01:51:18,772 --> 01:51:25,779
Girl! Shower honey in my dream, flower!

1307
01:51:25,779 --> 01:51:30,917
Rainfall! You satisfy my cute wishes.

1308
01:51:30,917 --> 01:51:36,289
Hey girl! You'll be there in my heart ever.

1309
01:51:36,289 --> 01:51:38,058
You're like the moon. Right?

1310
01:51:38,058 --> 01:51:41,687
You satisfy my cute wishes.
