1
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:07,501
Wake up 'Mumbai'
Hear this city's story.

2
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:14,703
Here Fuel prices soar high
Vehicles on the roads never go dry.

3
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:19,177
Petrol cost is on an upswing.
Rail network is rapidly spreading.

4
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:22,785
Man is losing his control.

5
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:30,161
Still, he trusts the big man
with the remote control.

6
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:34,127
There is a hope in every heart. To
grab a slice of pie at the very start.

7
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,724
So Boys and girls...
This is the story of Mumbai.

8
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,792
If you can't make it big here.

9
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:43,667
The defect is in you.
Blame yourself, not the city.

10
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:45,039
He is so right.

11
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:47,108
I always wanted to live in Mumbai.

12
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:51,076
To be seen traveling in Mumbai
was my childhood dream.

13
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:54,384
Relocating to Mumbai wasn't so easy.

14
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,349
You are moving to Mumbai.

15
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:59,585
Always remember... in big cities,

16
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:02,454
...people's hearts are
smaller than their homes.

17
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:04,521
Take care dear.

18
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,731
I moved here, a couple of months ago.

19
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:16,207
I felt, my dad worries for no reason.

20
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:19,002
Everything was going as planned.

21
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,705
I had a well paid job
People were good.

22
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:25,242
I made great friends.
And above all, I was very well paid.

23
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:34,321
But one day,

24
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:36,688
everything shattered,
in just one blow.

25
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,551
Due to the on going 2G scam...

26
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:41,758
Licences of 17 telecom Companies
have been Terminated

27
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:46,627
Telecom ministry has ordered a
probe on other telecom companies too.

28
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,702
Only time will tell how this will
affect the people and the employees.

29
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:56,144
I lost my job.
People distanced themselves.

30
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:59,579
Overnight, I had to vacate
my company accommodation.

31
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:07,452
I did not inform my dad
about my situation.

32
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:11,594
He would've called me back home.

33
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,361
I didn't want to go back as a loser.

34
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:17,167
If someone fails in Mumbai.

35
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:20,131
Then its the person's failure,
not the city's.

36
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:22,730
That's why, I decided to start afresh.

37
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:27,608
With my meager savings,
I rented out a flat,

38
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:33,274
Let's see whether I win or fail.

39
00:04:56,429 --> 00:05:03,608
Holy Mother... Bless me.

40
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:09,546
Oh sleeping beauty.

41
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,315
Why are you practicing yoga here?

42
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:15,491
I am sorry. Err...
I have rented this apartment.

43
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:17,526
Hi! I am... Ss...

44
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,256
TENANT! huh!

45
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:22,691
Simrin

46
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:35,541
English, eh!

47
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:06,736
Hey Tenantl!
Are you jobless?

48
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:10,243
Its very uncouth to pry
into people's personal stuff.

49
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,447
Did you carry this shop
of boxes all by yourself?

50
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:13,673
Where are the movers?

51
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:16,710
They were charging extra to unload.

52
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:20,020
ls it? Bloody over smart idiots.

53
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,259
How could they do this to a lady?

54
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:24,525
Earth wouldn't have shattered,
had they helped you a little

55
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:26,253
Bloody...

56
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:27,522
Bangles...

57
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,191
These guys should wear bangles
and sit at home

58
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,494
Indecent men.

59
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:45,015
This box...

60
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:51,580
Lift it very carefully... ok?
Bend your knees a little.

61
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:53,781
Else your back
will go for a toss.

62
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,626
Jayanta Speaking.
Ya tell me punk!

63
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,994
Did you hear him scream, Sir?

64
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:36,026
He just spat blood.

65
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:39,592
Soon I will make him
spit the money.

66
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,266
Ya Bhai(Chief),
it will be done.

67
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:18,235
Hey who kept this glass on
the edge of this table?

68
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:21,241
Chief, I will call you in a while.
Good bye. May god protect you.

69
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:25,449
So you started your
nonsense right away?

70
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:27,175
Did it break?

71
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:29,981
Clean it up!

72
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,086
Me? You expect me
to pick it up?

73
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,191
Tell the boys to do it... Chief!

74
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:37,721
They are busy.

75
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:42,660
They all have work to do.

76
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,196
What work?

77
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:54,275
They've gone to confiscate the
land in 'Bhandup'(Name of a place)

78
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:57,240
Come on Chief...
Why didn't you tell me?

79
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:59,676
I could've earned some money.

80
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:05,682
Listen dude.

81
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,519
My head has swollen
like a gourd since morning.

82
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:08,557
Don't piss me more.

83
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,391
Should I send you for collection?

84
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:12,519
Will you go?

85
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:14,363
ls my time so bad?

86
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,361
To be a beggar
after fighting the battle of Kruger?

87
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:22,198
Hello

88
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,066
Chief...

89
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,378
Yeah!

90
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:33,978
Chief, when am I getting
my own Beer bar?

91
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,653
Which Beer bar?

92
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:40,649
My own Beer bar!
You promised me!

93
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:45,157
Oh. Yeah! That one...

94
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:52,230
Err... Dutta was saying, its not
auspicious now to start anything new

95
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,668
To hell with Dutta.

96
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,764
Chief, Who the hell is he
to come in between us?

97
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:01,304
You made him sit on your shoulders
Now he is trying to piss in your ears.

98
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,207
He is not running the show.
He is burning the show.

99
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,605
Chief, who went
to the prison for you?

100
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,107
I went... Jayanta!

101
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,310
What did you promise me then?

102
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:12,522
Go Son... Go without any worries...

103
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:14,149
At the end of your term

104
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:15,385
I will make you
my right hand man

105
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:17,017
and you will have your own Beer bar

106
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:18,160
Didn't you promise me?

107
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:20,228
What's all this now?

108
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,227
You made Dutta happy
And I get a flying...

109
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:25,692
Are you done?

110
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:36,078
Listen... I promised to give it.

111
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:40,147
But I never promised when?

112
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:45,715
Where the hell are you?

113
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:48,520
I have been trying
to reach you for so long!

114
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:51,153
What? What?

115
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:52,488
What are you justifying?

116
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,231
Now it broke!

117
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:19,789
Ya dad... I am doing
extremely well at my job.

118
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:23,322
I am too busy. Loaded with work
even during weekends.

119
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:27,587
Sure dad... I will visit you.
Don't worry dad...

120
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:30,532
I am perfectly alright.
yeah I am coming!

121
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:33,230
Dad my boss is calling me.

122
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:34,327
Will talk to you later.

123
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:36,640
OK Bye. Love you.

124
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,439
Jayanta Speaking!
Listen. I want you to go to our...

125
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,036
‘Byculla’ Bar (Name of a place).
Right away.

126
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:19,379
A few extra smart men are saying,
the liquor we serve there is fake.

127
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,677
What is this Chief.

128
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,721
Why don't you send your Newbies
to handle such trivial issues?

129
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,217
With excuses lame...
Don't run through a narrow lane.

130
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:29,216
Go there right away!

131
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:37,361
What is her fault in this now?

132
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:40,428
Sorry baby! Muah!

133
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:43,705
Add ice into this now!

134
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:46,568
What's the issue?

135
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:47,609
Over there...

136
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,809
They boozed and ate like kings.

137
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,778
When its time to pay, they say,
the liquor served is fake.

138
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:56,313
ls it so?

139
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,524
Hey Ms. Mad Madonna!!

140
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:08,359
Come on Move out of here!
Its Pack up for you

141
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:15,771
Brothers... you will have to
pay an exit fee now.

142
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:20,439
Either Pay and go
or wait and get paid!

143
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,402
What the hell can you do?

144
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,272
You don't know whom we work for!

145
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:51,798
You are done!

146
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:53,065
Your bar is done!

147
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:55,075
Your Altaaf Bhai is done!

148
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,045
Fother...!

149
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:10,526
Damn, they boozed
and I get the darned hangover

150
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,663
Shut up you fools.

151
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:19,731
There the bar is ruined and here
you guys are cracking jokes? is it?

152
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:27,334
Altaf Chief. I am telling you.

153
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:29,512
If this news of fake liquor leaks.

154
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,682
Don't expect even
a fly to visit our bar.

155
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:34,411
You will have to convert
the bar into a cowshed.

156
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:38,578
Hey newbie... come over here.

157
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:41,491
What's your name?
Chief" I am Kunal!

158
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:44,318
Bad... your name is too decent.

159
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:48,020
Listen. Come here.

160
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:50,525
Hold this.

161
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:56,565
Go back to the place you came from.

162
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:03,273
You can't become a'Chief'
You look like one chocolate hero.

163
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:05,709
You can never be a'Chief'

164
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:07,115
Why Chief?

165
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:08,511
Where the hell is your shin.

166
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:13,252
Oh you punk if you don't
wear a shin over your t-shin.

167
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,186
How can you pull up your collars?

168
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:18,191
Even Chiefs and lords have
their uniforms. Do you understand?

169
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:43,753
Hello. Hello Ms. Simrin.

170
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:45,613
Hello Mr. Waghle.

171
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:48,715
How are you? All good?
- Yes thank you!

172
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:53,424
Mr. Waghle, remember you said
we have 24 hours water supply.

173
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,729
Listen! There is a
water cut on Thursdays.

174
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:00,600
Remaining <i>6</i> days of the week, you
get 4 hours of water supply everyday.

175
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,035
So that makes it 24 hours. Doesn't it?

176
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:04,533
OK!! Fine...

177
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,637
Mr. Waghle, do you know
my neighbor?

178
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,373
Neighbor? No I don't.

179
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:12,275
Over half of Mumbai residents have not
even seen the faces of their neighbors...

180
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:13,543
Knowing their names,
is out of question!

181
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:14,980

- Yeah!

182
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:18,653

Ya tell me brother!

184
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:27,121
Oh. You see the greenery
in the builders brochure.

185
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:28,563
How can you expect it in real?

186
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:31,694
ls there any greenery left in Mumbai?

187
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,740
Hey! Tenant... How come you are here?

188
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:16,273
Are you here for Break Fast?

189
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:18,581
No I came to watch the cricket match!

190
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,042
But there are no
TV sets on these walls!

191
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,179
Just Joking!

192
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:28,083
You cracked a Joke.
So I plastered one too!

193
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,756
Hello! Excuse me.

194
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:42,764
Brother! Please over here!

195
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:47,505
Hello! Excuse me!

196
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:49,737
Wait a minute!

197
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:00,120
Shut up!

198
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:18,235
Hello! Excuse me!
Brother.

199
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,303
Little boy!
Can you come over here please?

200
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:30,477
One portion spicy Scrambled
eggs without onions!

201
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:36,688
No Onions? We are so alike!

202
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:10,249
Hey Pakya! Wait over there!

203
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:14,029

204
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:17,662
Hey Pakya!

205
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,367
You have my word.

206
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:24,339
Don't worry.

207
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:26,568
Altaaf Bhai (Chief)
never says ‘No’ to me.

208
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:28,444
OK Chief, see you later.

209
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,342
OK bye.

210
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:31,604
Hey! Put the stand up.

211
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:32,738
Thank you.

212
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:36,144
Ok...where's my change?

213
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:46,428
Hey! This is just 20 bucks!

214
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,360
It should be 60

215
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:52,297
Are you trying to fool me?

216
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:54,193
Where's the rest?

217
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,436
What?

218
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:57,132
Hey drama queen!

219
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:59,271
One-portion scram bled eggs
costs 40!-

220
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:00,275
I gave you 100!-

221
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:02,278
I should get back 60!-

222
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:03,673
This is just 20!-

223
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:05,776
Come on give my money back!

224
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:15,183
OK! Now it's fine, see you!

225
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:16,449
Hey! Neighbor...

226
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:18,619
Give me my 10 bucks back!

227
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:24,690
I was just mic testing,

228
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:28,194
Just checking if your voice
can hold its own in Mumbai

229
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,743
Excuse me, who is this guy
you were talking to?

230
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:41,149
The one over there?

231
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:42,207
Oh! He is our Bhai (Chief)

232
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:43,548
Bhai? (Brother?) Really?

233
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:45,482
But you don't look alike?

234
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:48,455
He is not my real Brother.

235
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:50,525
He is our Chief (Bhai) Gangster

236
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:52,585
He was in jail...

237
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:53,822
Got out 4 months ago.

238
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:56,757
Gangster?

239
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:58,267
Yeah! Gangster!

240
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,061
Now hold your Posture...
Before you faint!

241
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,095
Gone are the days

242
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:05,766
when a woman was chased

243
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:07,304
by goons and thugs

244
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,639
and she screamed her

245
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:13,379
lungs out for 'Help'

246
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:17,519
Now we have 'Zaalim'
(Heartless) spray.

247
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:22,219
"Last week, It was around 9:30,

248
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:24,655
One tough big built guy
was acting smart.

249
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:25,786
With you?

250
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:29,325
No! With my Daughter-in-law

251
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:32,702
Thank god! We had 'Zaalim' spray.

253
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:38,639
And he ran for his life.

254
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:40,075
Good! Good!

255
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:46,040

You can go and work there.

272
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:23,068
I have told him about you.

273
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:24,408
Thank you so much Mr. Waghale.

274
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:25,573
You are so helpful.

275
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:29,084
No... I am not helping you.

276
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:30,319
I am helping myself.

Hey Neighbor! Money...

287
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:23,730

What's this?
I don't have change.

294
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:43,185
When you shopkeepers can do this.

295
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:45,057
Why can't we?
Taste your own medicine.

296
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:48,662
So now eat it and forget it.

297
00:24:57,128 --> 00:24:59,438
Hey fake MF Hussain

298
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:03,206
You forgot your Apoostrophy!

299
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:07,273
But there's no trophy in the design!

300
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:10,444
You idiot! I am not
talking about any trophy.

301
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:13,019
Its Apoostrophy!

302
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:15,216

Sir, This is in demand now!

00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:24,297
It has a good battery life
and better memory

307
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:25,661
Let me try

308
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:33,005
Hello. Hello.

309
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,234
Hello. Hello.

00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,277
Aunty, I am Pappu here.

311
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:38,579
Can you hear me?

312
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,205
Looks like some
network issue.

313
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:42,316
Aunty, I am Pappu...

314
00:25:42,407 --> 00:25:43,351
Let me just step
out and try. Can I?

315
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:44,318
Hello.

316
00:25:47,445 --> 00:25:49,049

Get the hell out
of here. You scum!

00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:36,468
If I ever see you in my network
I'll disconnect you.

321
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:38,438
Thank you.

322
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:41,041
I would have had to pay
for this goof up.

323
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:44,474
Neighbor! Phone

324
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:54,517
I am joking!

325
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:56,356
Sense of humourous

326
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:19,747
Stay focused, Stay Calm.

327
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:21,272
Look Professional

328
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,386

00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,399
Nope...it's the hen's eggs

333
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:22,373
How can you just take it
without out asking?

334
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:24,240
I have to go for an interview!

335
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:28,009
Now I'm... soaking wet!

336
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:31,177
Here take this and wipe yourself dry!

337
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:32,444
Arrgghh!

338
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:36,421
Hey! Hey Tenant!

339
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:38,992
Your umbrella was lying outside

340
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:40,758
I thought you would not need it now.

341
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,726
Sir, the answer to your
question is quite obvious.

342
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:48,227
If you apply C Max formula.
Then it can be derived at.

343
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:50,005
That's good!

344
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:02,313

If we have time left,
I will interview you.

348
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:16,989
Carry on Mr. Vartak.

349
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,633
Sir, we can input all
the data to the formula.

350
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:21,332
And arrive at the solution.

351
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:26,233
Sir its a proven fact that,
applying the best logistic solution.

352
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:29,540
..during a regular occurance
is an answer.

353
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:41,419
HEY! Tenant!

354
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:45,984

358
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:54,261
Just Joking!

359
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:05,239
Others crap and I get to smell
the poop its a big bad world.

360
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:56,188
Hello sir.

361
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:09,770
See this hand!

362
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:15,446
It will always remind you,
if you don't salute Alex.

363
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,281
Then Alex will be angry!

364
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:22,650
Sir, please get into the car.

365
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,250
I have a lot to discuss.

366
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:26,619
Alex Sir, Don Altaf is flying too high.
We need to give him a reality check.

367
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,426
Did that builder Sanghvi say that?

368
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:31,761
To cut his stomach
to get the money out?

369
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:33,800
Yes Dutta Bhai...
- What yes?

370
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:37,063
...and we were outnumbered.
we couldn't fight him!

371
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:38,163
You sissies!

372
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:42,136
One should have balls to fight.

373
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:45,044
Hello Chief,
- Hello!

374
00:31:45,503 --> 00:31:46,379
Whats happened?

375
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:48,207
Did he get caught with
his pants down again?

376
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:52,121
Sorry Chief!

377
00:31:52,143 --> 00:31:53,053
Shut up!

378
00:31:57,315 --> 00:31:58,521
J ayanta!

379
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:02,131
You wanted challenging task,
didn't you?

380
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:07,162
Now is the time!

381
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:09,736
Do you know Sanghvi Builder?

382
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:12,270
Yeah! The property guy,
that bald fatso,

383
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:13,365
...whose wife left him.

384
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:15,137
We need to recover
some money from him.

385
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,676
If you succeed...

386
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:20,011
10% of the booty is yours

387
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:23,149
2 million! Think.

388
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:27,115
20 boxes?

389
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:30,689
10% of 20 boxes means, 2 boxes!

390
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,185
In one shot!

391
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:33,623
Boss I am game. When should I go?

392
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:35,129
NOW!

393
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:36,254
Take my car and go.

394
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:37,800
Kunal... here take the keys.

395
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:43,503
Go with Jayanta
And learn something.

396
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,368
Come-on NOOB.

397
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,132
I'll take you to the matinee show

398
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,519
BOSS! WTF Boss?

399
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,050
You see my attitude when

400
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:01,987
I get my own Beer Bar!

401
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:06,161
I am Altaf chief's only favorite.

402
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:08,995
What's your home name?

403
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:11,726
Chief, its "Laxmi Sadan"

404
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,026
You dumb ass...

405
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:16,999
I meant what is your pet name.

406
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:18,639
Err.. Umm.

407
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,308
Chief...My folks, call me 'Kunnu'...
Affectionately

408
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:24,008
Kunnu!

409
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,615
When your folks call
you affectionately

410
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:30,678
Why did you enter
this world of hatred?

411
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:32,713
I was helpless Bhai!

412
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:37,024
But now I'm enjoying it.

413
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:38,152
Yeah! Right!

414
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:42,020
You will know it when you
lose your arms and legs...

415
00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:44,396
...and get thrown in a drain

416
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:54,566
I didn't get it chief.

417
00:33:54,732 --> 00:33:56,143
You won't get it.

418
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:59,038
This is Bhai-logy"
[Underworld subject]

419
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,346
It's a very intense subject.

420
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,617
And I'm the master of it

421
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:15,624
Mr. Sanghvi, I heard every morning you
go to the beach for a Morning walk?

422
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:20,765
Skip tomorrow

423
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:23,496
It may affect your health.

424
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:25,774
And if you still decide to go.

425
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:29,768
Make sure,
you pay up Altaaf Bhai's 20 lakhs.

426
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:43,125
Wow. Wow.

427
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:46,019
There is a new doc in town.

428
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:51,323
Jayanta Bhai MBBS.

429
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:57,595
I wanted to see who
is after Sanghvi's ass.

430
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:04,408
Jayanta Bhai MBBS.

431
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,104
What is this Jayanta?

432
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:09,551
I thought you would be a changed man
after you went to jail.

433
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:15,581
You know, my bosses asked me
to wipe out Altaaf's gang.

434
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,591
In fake encounters...

435
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:20,656
But I am very romantic at heart.

436
00:35:21,752 --> 00:35:23,254
I am like Mr. Yash Chopra.

437
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:25,393
I let them go.

438
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:28,731
Like how i will let you go today.

439
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:34,541
Go on child. Go live your life!

440
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:39,778
Oh! So much anger?

441
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:53,355
Can you see stars in the daylight now?

442
00:35:57,455 --> 00:35:59,401
Go tell your Boss Altaf.

443
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:06,973
Superintendent of Police
Alex Pandiyan has come to the party

444
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:11,469
Like how Altaf forgot
to honor his promise to you.

445
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:14,743
Similarly tell him even Sanghvi

446
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:16,675
has forgotten to honor his promise

447
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,717
He has forgotten everything.

448
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,383
Doesn't remember anything

449
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,572
What? Pandian's been
chucked out of the Police?

450
00:36:40,097 --> 00:36:42,043
When? How come nobody told me

451
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:43,100
I would've smashed his face.

452
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:47,309
I would've shot him to death,
right there.

453
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:51,219
I would've shot him to death,
right there.

454
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:54,615
Hey. Just because
Alex is not in the Police

455
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:58,020
...doesn't mean he has lost his grip.

456
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:01,955
Looks like he wants
to go back to jail.

457
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:05,194
Just for once use your bloody brains.
You fool!

458
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:11,964
Dutta, calm down. Sit" sit down.

459
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:19,276
Jayanta, Dutta is right.

460
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,382
It's foolishness to kill him now.

461
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:28,648
Let's wait for the right time.

462
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,726
You both keep waiting. I am off.

463
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:02,953
Hey tenant!

464
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,185
Hey tenant!

465
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:10,630
Hey tenant... Turn off your Alarm.

466
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,499
The sound has pierced
a hole into my ear drum.

467
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:14,696
HEY TENANT!!

468
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:17,402
Sir, what's the matter?

469
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,270
Hey Mr. White out!

470
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:20,668
Who the hell are you?

471
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:21,732
Myself... Mr. P. K.Waga
e.

472
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:22,704
I am an estate agent.

473
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,274
My client wants to see this house.

474
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:28,475
The girl inside..., is she moving out?

475
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:29,449
Yeah!

476
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:30,349
Why?

477
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:32,319
She says her neighbor is a goon.

478
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:33,150
Goon?

479
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:35,520
Ha Ha. Don't worry madam.
I will handle this.

480
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:38,325
Move aside.

481
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:45,623
Hey. Tell her to
stop the darned alarm.

482
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,196
My earwax has melted away

483
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:49,271
Teet! Teet! Teet! Teet!

484
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:53,438
ls he a goon ?

485
00:38:58,269 --> 00:38:59,077
Suicide!!!

Suicide!!!

487
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:04,179
Hey! Tenant? Wake up!

488
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:05,712
What happened?

489
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:08,622
No. I didn't do anything.

490
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:10,289
Help me lift her.

491
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:15,059
Hey! Goon... Sir!!

492
00:39:18,055 --> 00:39:19,398
Hold on Mr.

Waitmtake this along.

494
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:25,268
You may have to show
this to the doctor.

495
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:26,633
Put it in my pocket.

496
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,571
What a pain you are man.

497
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:30,637
ls he a goon?

498
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:32,743
No...err... These days one never knows.

499
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:33,607
We can't comment about anyone.

500
00:39:34,338 --> 00:39:36,318
Rickshaw!!! Roopadevi hospital!

501
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:40,516
Where you going? To fu...free
your mother from the slammer.

502
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:44,125
Hey Tenant.
Please wake up.

503
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:48,292
Move! Move! Move!

504
00:39:50,187 --> 00:39:52,167
Hey tenant.
Wake up please.

505
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,258
Please don't die on me.

506
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:55,367
I have no desire to be
haunted by your ghost or spirit.

507
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:57,201
Who told you to pop those pills?

508
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:58,767
You have to be little more patient.

509
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,343
Women these days are so impatient.

510
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:04,437
Emergency! Emergency!
Move on!

511
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:06,344
Clear my way.
Emergency! Emergency!

512
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:08,242
Sister it's an emergency.

513
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:11,411
OK. Bring her over here.

514
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:15,583
Doctor!

515
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:17,423
Hey tenant.
Please wake up.

516
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:19,151
Move.

517
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,727
Doctor... Please help.

518
00:40:21,051 --> 00:40:22,394
Hey tenant.
Please wake up.

519
00:40:22,453 --> 00:40:23,363
What happened to her?

520
00:40:24,321 --> 00:40:26,232
Doc, she's overdosed on these pills.

521
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:27,728
These are supplements.

522
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:30,033
Supplements?? Oh god, Crazy woman!

523
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,539
Why did you have supplements?

524
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:34,576
Hey... Mr. you please wait outside.

525
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:36,336
Listen, get out of
here...Wait outside.

526
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,706
Sister I need to be with her.

527
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:41,446
NO. You stay away. Wait outside.

528
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:48,416
Sister, what are supplements?

529
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:50,516
Supplements are vitamins.

530
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:53,117
Oh God. Can someone
die because of vitamins?

531
00:40:55,553 --> 00:40:57,692
Nonsense! You please go and sit there.

532
00:40:58,422 --> 00:41:00,561
Why is she talking to me in subtitles?

533
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:03,194
Fat ass!

534
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:09,769
It's strange Jayanta.

535
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:14,279
Till date you have sent
many people to the hospital.

536
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:15,777
But, never like this.

537
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:27,028
Hey Mr.! Your patient
has gained consciousness.

538
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:29,360
What happened to her?

539
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,488
Weakness!

540
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:33,593
Darn, can people become
weak by taking Vitamins?

541
00:41:34,024 --> 00:41:36,470
You Fool. She has been starving.

542
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,264
She took supplements instead of food.

543
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:39,407
U nderstood now?

544
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:42,211
[its so difficult
to make him understand]

545
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,239
Hey tenant.

546
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:47,577
Hey tenant, why are lying
down wearing a curtain?

547
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:49,412
You? What the hell are you doing here?

548
00:41:49,473 --> 00:41:51,612
Your MOTHERs... blessings!

549
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,245
I got you here.

550
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:54,584
I carried you on my back.

551
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:58,354
While you enjoyed the ride,
passed out!

552
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:00,585
I passed-out?

553
00:42:02,753 --> 00:42:03,731
In my room...is it?

554
00:42:04,054 --> 00:42:04,998
Yeah!

555
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,196
What were you doing in my room?

556
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,736
Bloody hell! That Wagale came over.

557
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:12,031
He opened your door.
He wanted to show...

558
00:42:13,597 --> 00:42:17,568
You don't want to live
next to a gangster... Right?

559
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:19,237
Oh God! I'll faint again!

560
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:22,212
Hey Drama queen. Cut the crap
and get up.

561
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:26,220
You shouldn't be
rude to a sick person.

562
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:28,021
Hello Ms. Sick Person

563
00:42:28,612 --> 00:42:31,354
Had I not brought you here.

564
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:36,291
You would've gone by now. Far away!

565
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:40,166
She got hospitalized
and my wallet fell ill.

566
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:47,405
Hey Neighbor!

567
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:48,306
Yeah!

568
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:51,174
Thank you!
For settling my hospital bills.

569
00:42:51,535 --> 00:42:52,809
I am down by 1400!-

570
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:54,072
I'll pay you back, ok!

571
00:42:54,204 --> 00:42:55,182
Quickly ok?

572
00:42:55,606 --> 00:42:57,813
Or else I will send you
back to the hospital again.

573
00:42:58,442 --> 00:42:59,819
Jayantabhai is very tough

574
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:01,022
ls it?
- Yes

575
00:43:01,178 --> 00:43:02,748
Then why do you
keep getting beaten up?

576
00:43:15,626 --> 00:43:17,731
Madam, even Gangsters are human!

577
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,438
Hello! Tenant" Interview again?

578
00:43:49,693 --> 00:43:51,673
Yeah! But how did you know?

579
00:43:52,229 --> 00:43:53,173
It's raining that's why.

580
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:54,332
Very Funny!

581
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:57,310
So now laugh and forget.

582
00:43:59,036 --> 00:44:01,414
Hey Neighbor!
Would you have an umbrella?

583
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:04,518
Of course I would, when
I buy it I would have it.

584
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:06,016
Very Funny!

585
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:08,687
Where is your umbrella?

586
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,054
I forgot it at my last interview

587
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:15,290
Now I know why you
fail in your interviews!

588
00:44:26,563 --> 00:44:28,201
OK... Glve me 200 bucks.

589
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,276
Why 200?

590
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:31,713
I want to buy Ambani's
factory for you.

591
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:34,449
I'll get an umbrella for you.

592
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:36,674
Are you serious?

593
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:39,416
Serious people are all in ICU.

594
00:44:39,476 --> 00:44:41,012
They don't roam free like me.

595
00:44:41,645 --> 00:44:42,680
Now tell me if you want it.

596
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:44,089
Or keep walking like a wet hen.

597
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:45,555
This is just a one time offer...
mind you!

598
00:44:57,461 --> 00:44:58,337
Leave it!

599
00:44:58,395 --> 00:44:59,396
Get the cheapest one.

600
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:00,567
Yeah! Cheapness!

601
00:45:57,788 --> 00:45:59,631
Didn't even bother to thank me.

602
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:03,437
Oh god. Its hurting.

603
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:05,362
Hey Neighbor.

604
00:46:08,132 --> 00:46:10,043
Thank you so much!

605
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:16,543
Welcome Not!

606
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:19,983
Hey. Also,
best of lucks for your interview

607
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:26,686
ls she the last candidate?

608
00:46:27,017 --> 00:46:27,688
Yes sir.

609
00:46:29,486 --> 00:46:31,432
So... Miss Simrin Desai!

610
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:33,465
You just have 2 months experience.

611
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:40,569
Hmm. Do you have a boyfriend?

612
00:46:42,266 --> 00:46:43,301
Excuse me sir?

613
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:45,037
I asked you a simple question!

614
00:46:45,102 --> 00:46:46,672
Do you have a boyfriend?

615
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:49,641
No sir.

616
00:46:49,773 --> 00:46:54,153
She must be very focused on work perhaps
that's why she doesn't have a boyfriend.

617
00:46:54,344 --> 00:46:57,791
OK! Do you like music?

618
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:00,626
Yes Sir.

619
00:47:00,684 --> 00:47:02,288
Good. Very good!

620
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:04,698
Singing and Dancing?

621
00:47:06,356 --> 00:47:07,266
Sorry Sir.

622
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:10,032
Do you know the ‘Touch me,
touch me‘ song?

623
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:19,340
Yes sir.

624
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,380
Good. Very Good!

625
00:47:22,072 --> 00:47:24,678
Then why don't you dance
and sing the same for us?

626
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:28,749
Sir... here? Right now?

627
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:31,516
We want to see how confident you are.

628
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:37,664
Simrin, come on. Be a sport.

629
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:40,159
Come on do it. No problem.

630
00:47:51,468 --> 00:47:53,072
No. No No. Hold it.

631
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:55,741
Hey show her the way
it was done in the film.

632
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,446
It was something like this.

633
00:48:01,345 --> 00:48:02,619
Do it the way it was filmed.

634
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:11,158
Nice. Not bad.

635
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,670
Please stop the bus.

636
00:49:14,518 --> 00:49:15,519
There she is.

637
00:49:16,553 --> 00:49:20,160
Hey Simmi. What's up?

638
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,035
How was your interview?

639
00:49:23,193 --> 00:49:25,469
Oh my gosh! Please don't cry.

640
00:49:33,537 --> 00:49:35,642
Do the breathing exercise.

641
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:37,416
Take a deep breath.

642
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:42,617
Oh God... She's crying again.

643
00:49:43,046 --> 00:49:44,150
What happened?

644
00:49:47,517 --> 00:49:50,293
Today... in the interview...

645
00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:51,526
What happened there?

646
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:55,292
I was humiliated.

647
00:49:56,026 --> 00:49:58,404
You tell me who insulted you?

648
00:49:58,462 --> 00:49:59,600
I will smash his face.

649
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:00,998
Who did it?

650
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:07,342
That guy said... 'touch rne'

651
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:09,209
What? Did that guy touch you?

652
00:50:09,272 --> 00:50:11,343
Bloody...I'll send his Sister$*

653
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:12,576
Did he touch you?

654
00:50:12,642 --> 00:50:13,484
No!

655
00:50:13,543 --> 00:50:16,251
He didn't touch you?

656
00:50:16,613 --> 00:50:18,718
Are you crying for not being touched?

657
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:20,058
NO!

658
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:24,688
I had to...to...dance...

659
00:50:25,088 --> 00:50:27,762
Oh! You silly
girl...that's no big deal.

660
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:29,192
I will teach you.

661
00:50:29,326 --> 00:50:31,203
I am an ace dancer and singer.

662
00:50:31,795 --> 00:50:33,206
Forget it.

663
00:50:35,265 --> 00:50:37,074
Why does she always scream at me?

664
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:39,077
Hey Tenant. Wait there.

665
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:13,327
Hey waiter. Get it fast.

666
00:53:17,394 --> 00:53:19,169
Ladies first brother

667
00:53:29,005 --> 00:53:31,281
You love scrambled eggs, don't you?

668
00:53:31,608 --> 00:53:34,214
Look how you are hogging it all.

669
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:36,147
I love scrambled eggs.

670
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:37,483
Me too.

671
00:53:39,015 --> 00:53:41,518
At times how do you
speak fluent English?

672
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:44,196
Are you educated?

673
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:47,499
l.J. University. Third Degree.

674
00:53:49,626 --> 00:53:51,697
'Indian Jail's university'.

675
00:53:53,263 --> 00:53:55,265
Our Indian jails' are visited by so
many educated people.

676
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:58,713
I heard them speak
and learnt from them.

677
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:11,024
Hey tenant, please stop it.
People are staring at us.

678
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:13,054
Please don't call me ‘Tenant’

679
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:14,986
it sounds so crude.

680
00:54:15,452 --> 00:54:16,430
So, what do I call you?

681
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:19,159
Simmi.

682
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:20,560
SlMM-MEE

683
00:54:21,124 --> 00:54:22,194
SlMM-MEE

684
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:25,232
Hey Simmi. You are so talented.

685
00:54:25,662 --> 00:54:27,505
Then why aren't you getting a job?

686
00:54:29,132 --> 00:54:31,612
Recessions, Scams, there are
many such reasons

687
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:35,446
Hey Simmi.

688
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:39,250
You want a job right?

689
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:40,183
Yeah.

690
00:54:40,243 --> 00:54:41,415
You do one thing.

691
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:46,523
Go beg and plead.

692
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:48,289
I am sure you will get a job

693
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:52,498
Neighbor,
you have your scrambled eggs.

694
00:54:58,695 --> 00:55:00,606
I can do all this only
when I get an interview call.

695
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:03,144
Bullcrap.
Why should you wait for a call?

696
00:55:03,433 --> 00:55:06,505
Like a salesman. Go to
every office and apply for a job.

697
00:55:06,603 --> 00:55:07,479
If it happens,
good for you.

698
00:55:07,537 --> 00:55:08,481
If it doesn't,
try again.

699
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:23,264
Mr. Pandey, this is my CV.

700
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:26,429
I shall keep it with me.

701
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:30,365
But the fact is,
we only hire experienced people.

702
00:55:31,394 --> 00:55:33,374
Sir. See if you can do something.

703
00:55:33,563 --> 00:55:36,635
Very difficult,
but we will keep you posted.

704
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:39,507
Rohit, one moment please

705
00:55:40,637 --> 00:55:41,741

707
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:54,593

NO SIR. Just Rohit.

714
00:56:10,133 --> 00:56:12,739
Can something work out?

715
00:56:13,136 --> 00:56:14,581
Why not? Nothing is impossible

716
00:56:15,171 --> 00:56:16,582
You visited our office today...

717
00:56:16,973 --> 00:56:18,077
And you have applied for a job.

718
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:21,418
We are starting a new department.

719
00:56:21,511 --> 00:56:23,115
We will be recruiting soon.

720
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:24,754
I will try my best.

721
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:26,391
You keep your fingers crossed.

722
00:56:44,667 --> 00:56:45,543
Hi!

723
00:56:45,702 --> 00:56:47,079
Oh my god.

724
00:56:49,539 --> 00:56:51,644
Ten&!@... Simmi.

725
00:56:52,108 --> 00:56:53,678
Hope I didn't disturb you.

726
00:56:54,377 --> 00:56:56,015
Ahhh... NO.

727
00:56:56,212 --> 00:56:57,555
You know what?

728
00:56:58,081 --> 00:56:59,287
Hey. Stay back.

729
00:57:01,985 --> 00:57:08,459
You know what... your idea
of visiting every office, worked.

730
00:57:08,992 --> 00:57:09,732
Whoa!

731
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:15,175
I can see your excitement.

732
00:57:15,365 --> 00:57:16,343
Forget all of that.

733
00:57:16,399 --> 00:57:18,072
Thank you so much

734
00:57:18,201 --> 00:57:19,077
Welcome not

735
00:57:19,302 --> 00:57:22,374
I got you your favorite
a chicken roll

736
00:57:22,505 --> 00:57:23,540
OH WOW...

737
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:25,753
Put it there,
over there.

738
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:30,616
You know, once I get a job I
will treat you at a 5 Star restaurant.

739
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:31,590
We'll have scrambled
eggs when we go there.

740
00:57:31,648 --> 00:57:33,184
Yeah. Good idea.

741
00:57:33,349 --> 00:57:34,555
Will you please go now?

742
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:36,187
Yeah. Bye.

743
00:57:36,219 --> 00:57:37,197
Bye!

744
00:57:37,353 --> 00:57:38,354
Bye!

745
00:57:38,555 --> 00:57:39,625
Bye!

746
00:57:54,604 --> 00:57:56,606
She said, she will treat
me at a 5 star restaurant.

747
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:59,787
I hope he doesn't think
that I'm falling in love with him.

748
00:58:00,376 --> 00:58:04,449
Oh man, ls she falling
in love with me?

749
00:58:16,526 --> 00:58:17,504
Here... take it.

750
00:58:26,202 --> 00:58:27,840
I can't believe this.

751
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:32,809
I can't believe this.
Thank you so much.

752
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:34,321
I promised you a job, didn't I?

753
00:58:34,811 --> 00:58:36,119
You deserve it.

754
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,520
Finally... Here we are...

755
00:58:45,321 --> 00:58:46,322
Why are we here?

756
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,264
You wanted to thank me right?

757
00:58:48,391 --> 00:58:52,100
There is no better and safe place
than this, to thank me.

758
00:58:54,397 --> 00:58:57,207
If you not too comfortable with this place,
we could go to some other place.

759
00:58:57,267 --> 00:58:59,838
I have another safe and secure option.

760
00:59:00,837 --> 00:59:01,577
What do you mean?

761
00:59:03,306 --> 00:59:05,411
Oh! Don't tell me you
not aware of these things!

762
00:59:05,575 --> 00:59:08,317
See, I have done you a huge favor.

763
00:59:08,578 --> 00:59:11,218
Why don't you return my favor...
in kind?

764
00:59:11,347 --> 00:59:16,092
Just today...that's it, I promise!

765
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:18,088
You sick man!

766
00:59:29,265 --> 00:59:30,471
Hey Mr.Cable Guy

767
00:59:31,134 --> 00:59:33,410
You think you are too smart enough
to disconnect my network?

768
00:59:34,103 --> 00:59:35,138
lam fixing it now.

769
00:59:36,105 --> 00:59:38,984
Yeah. OK fine. I forgive you.

770
00:59:39,442 --> 00:59:40,477
Hey! Tenant

771
00:59:45,114 --> 00:59:47,390
You look so flushed out.

772
00:59:47,784 --> 00:59:48,819
Why?

773
00:59:54,123 --> 00:59:55,864
He took rne to the
'Night Lovers' Hotel.

774
00:59:55,892 --> 00:59:57,337
' Night Lovers'? Goodness

775
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:59,872
That's a cheap,
low class by the hour hotel!

776
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:03,141
He wanted to sleep with me.

777
01:00:07,036 --> 01:00:10,916
And... you didn't sleep?

778
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:14,220
NO. I didn't...

779
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:18,748
And if you so desperate
to sleep with him. Then take this!

780
01:00:18,915 --> 01:00:20,121
Hey! Simmi. Listen to me.

781
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:25,433
Why does she always get pissed at me?

01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:44,349

792
01:01:13,269 --> 01:01:14,839
They want to surprise him.

793
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:18,351

797
01:01:31,254 --> 01:01:34,235
You know, Rohit is going

798
01:01:45,301 --> 01:01:46,780

You've got a call from
'Night Lovers' hotel.

801
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:01,059
Does that ring a bell?

802
01:02:03,186 --> 01:02:04,221
Get up you sack of potatoes!

803
01:02:04,487 --> 01:02:05,795
What kind of surprise is this?

804
01:02:07,023 --> 01:02:09,025
Suresh, please help me man!

805
01:02:09,158 --> 01:02:11,468
Hey punk...
move aside or face the music.

806
01:02:15,999 --> 01:02:17,945
Are you a politician?
Why you holding on to a chair then?

807
01:02:18,001 --> 01:02:18,945
Get up!

808
01:02:22,772 --> 01:02:25,446
Security. Security. Please Help!

809
01:02:25,975 --> 01:02:26,919
Shut up!

810
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:31,453
I have come to hit you.
Not to hit on you!

811
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:33,052
Do you understand?

812
01:02:35,018 --> 01:02:37,055
Sir Please let me go.

813
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:39,157
Hey stop your antics

814
01:02:39,389 --> 01:02:41,266
Sir this is not right.

815
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:47,401
Bloody A-hole, you tried to act fresh
with my ‘Simrin’?

816
01:02:50,233 --> 01:02:51,871
You like sleeping around, right?

817
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:55,916
Now go and sleep in the hospital.

818
01:03:11,054 --> 01:03:12,465
Just Joking!

819
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:18,234
By the way madam,
Even your lipstick is pretty hot.

820
01:03:26,169 --> 01:03:34,782
I told that 'Sharma'
once we file a complaint.

821
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:37,482
He will have to visit police station
a couple of times.

822
01:03:38,181 --> 01:03:40,388
He didn't want to pursue the case

823
01:03:40,783 --> 01:03:43,957
He doesn't want his wife
to know about all of this.

824
01:03:44,787 --> 01:03:47,961
You are safe this time.

825
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:52,170
But be careful next time. if
I ever catch you doing this again...

826
01:03:54,063 --> 01:03:55,770
Now get the hell out of here.

827
01:03:56,232 --> 01:03:58,041
Thank you sir.

828
01:03:58,167 --> 01:03:59,339
Mention not.

829
01:04:03,106 --> 01:04:04,278
I want to thank you.

830
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:07,444
VVow! Let's go to 'Night Lovers'

831
01:04:07,810 --> 01:04:08,811
Shut up!

832
01:04:09,879 --> 01:04:11,153
How much money do you have?

833
01:04:11,314 --> 01:04:12,952
May be some 2000/-

834
01:04:13,883 --> 01:04:17,956
Now I owe you 3400!-
- Am I your ATM?

835
01:04:19,922 --> 01:04:21,924
In life, give people so much that,

836
01:04:22,091 --> 01:04:24,230
you feel happy
when they return it.

837
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:25,495
Come let's go.

838
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:45,890
My god... You are a tanker.

839
01:04:46,182 --> 01:04:47,422
Let's have one more.

840
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:48,820
One for good luck.

841
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:53,363
But, all I got is bad luck, loads!

842
01:04:56,392 --> 01:05:00,272
Just a minute.
Give me your hand.

843
01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:13,250
This is my lucky charm.
Now see how your luck changes.

844
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:35,189
Hey Ten... Simmi!
Good night.

845
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:41,759
I want to drink more.

846
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:45,998
But where is the booze?

847
01:09:32,802 --> 01:09:37,308
Simmi, last night, whatever happened
between us... Lovering!

848
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,842
No. No. its wrongly English.

849
01:09:41,811 --> 01:09:44,121
Oh God. There she is.

850
01:09:51,053 --> 01:09:55,160
Simmi, How are you?

851
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:00,362
Damn! How are you?

852
01:10:01,831 --> 01:10:04,175
Hey Simmi, wait a minute please.

853
01:10:06,836 --> 01:10:08,110
I want to talk...

854
01:10:09,472 --> 01:10:10,450
Hello!

855
01:10:11,407 --> 01:10:14,115
I want to talk to you in private.

856
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:20,888
Last night we got little carried away.

857
01:10:22,451 --> 01:10:25,227
Hope it's not anything serious.

858
01:10:25,955 --> 01:10:26,797
I know.

859
01:10:26,856 --> 01:10:27,493
I Swear...

860
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:32,168
I don't want anything heavy and deep,
you know.

861
01:10:33,329 --> 01:10:36,333
Simmi, please hear me out.

862
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:41,812
You know...

863
01:10:41,837 --> 01:10:42,474
Yeah. Tell me.

864
01:10:42,538 --> 01:10:45,451
When I used to visit my grandma
in ‘Nainital’, during my holidays.

865
01:10:45,808 --> 01:10:47,287
It used to be extreme cold there.

866
01:10:47,343 --> 01:10:48,253
Yeah... right.

867
01:10:48,377 --> 01:10:49,822
We had a pet dog 'Bruno'...

868
01:10:49,879 --> 01:10:50,823
ls it so?
- Yeah!

869
01:10:51,146 --> 01:10:55,060
On extremely cold nights
I used to cuddle my dog and sleep.

870
01:10:55,317 --> 01:10:57,228
Last night it was no different.

871
01:10:59,488 --> 01:11:00,330
Hold on!!

872
01:11:01,056 --> 01:11:02,433
You mean to say...
I am a dog?

873
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:04,802
You mean to say you
slept with a dog last night?

874
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:05,928
Ewwwvv. Stop it!

875
01:11:06,028 --> 01:11:07,200
Now what 'Stop it'?

876
01:11:07,396 --> 01:11:09,535
Now my talking is
like 'barking' to you...

877
01:11:09,832 --> 01:11:10,469
ls it?

878
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:12,902
Bow-Wow [Barks]

879
01:11:35,457 --> 01:11:36,765
Greetings! Chief

880
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:39,962
Hello chief...

881
01:11:41,897 --> 01:11:43,001
What is this chief?

882
01:11:43,866 --> 01:11:45,004
Why did you give him money?

883
01:11:47,436 --> 01:11:51,851
This will ruin our reputation.

884
01:11:52,041 --> 01:11:53,179
Where is our clout Boss?

885
01:12:02,351 --> 01:12:03,887
This is a business.

886
01:12:05,187 --> 01:12:08,134
And I know how to
run this show.

887
01:12:12,361 --> 01:12:13,362
Listen.

888
01:12:13,963 --> 01:12:16,204
Don't poke your nose
in Alex Pandian's affairs.

889
01:12:16,265 --> 01:12:17,471
You got it?

890
01:12:20,769 --> 01:12:21,804
Chief...

891
01:12:23,739 --> 01:12:25,741
I want to show you something.

892
01:12:29,812 --> 01:12:33,259
You sure, I can find the
old 'Bar Punks' here?

893
01:12:33,482 --> 01:12:34,324
Of course, chief.

894
01:12:34,383 --> 01:12:37,159
These guys work for Alex Pandian.

895
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:39,959
But Chief... Dutta asked you
not to mess with Pandian.

896
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:41,399
To hell with Dutta.

897
01:12:41,790 --> 01:12:45,260
Dutta said not to mess with Pandian.

898
01:12:45,894 --> 01:12:47,805
But I can surely play with his balls.

899
01:12:47,863 --> 01:12:48,933
Come, let's go.

900
01:13:02,978 --> 01:13:04,150
Chief. Jayanta's here.

901
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:05,283
What the hell is he doing here?

902
01:13:06,115 --> 01:13:07,992
He must be wanting
to show his smartness to us.

903
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:11,220
I smashed a bottle on
your head the other day.

904
01:13:11,987 --> 01:13:13,967
Today I will smash
your head like that bottle.

905
01:13:47,790 --> 01:13:52,790
So Mr.Ta
king Tom You wanted
to ruin all of us...Didn't you?

906
01:14:00,202 --> 01:14:03,149
There is no weight in your words.

907
01:14:03,806 --> 01:14:11,520
Wait. Let me add some weight.

908
01:14:12,548 --> 01:14:14,994
Bloody Bench breaker!

909
01:14:30,733 --> 01:14:33,771
Hey.
- What is it?

910
01:14:35,003 --> 01:14:36,311
Why did you call me?

911
01:14:37,172 --> 01:14:39,243
To leash me and take me for a walk?

912
01:14:39,775 --> 01:14:41,777
So I can take a piss
on the light pole.

913
01:14:41,844 --> 01:14:42,914
Yuck!

914
01:14:46,782 --> 01:14:47,419
Check this out!

915
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:48,359
What's this?

916
01:14:48,417 --> 01:14:49,487
I've got a call for an Interview

917
01:14:49,785 --> 01:14:50,786
Here?

918
01:14:51,086 --> 01:14:52,087
Very funny.

919
01:14:52,788 --> 01:14:54,290
So laugh and forget!

920
01:14:55,023 --> 01:14:56,024
Do you know...

921
01:14:56,091 --> 01:14:57,798
This will be my second round.

922
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:59,064
First was written test.

923
01:14:59,128 --> 01:15:00,300
And I have cleared it.

924
01:15:00,395 --> 01:15:02,966
Your bracelet is really very lucky.

925
01:15:03,932 --> 01:15:04,842
You mean...

926
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:06,811
The day to have scrambled eggs
in a 5-star Hotel is not too far.

927
01:15:06,869 --> 01:15:08,041
Of course.

928
01:15:08,403 --> 01:15:09,814
Hey...Listen!

929
01:15:10,305 --> 01:15:11,443
Don't feel offended.

930
01:15:11,907 --> 01:15:14,319
What will be your salary?

931
01:15:14,810 --> 01:15:16,812
Around 70,000!-

932
01:15:16,912 --> 01:15:17,788
Oh my god!

933
01:15:17,846 --> 01:15:18,824
ls it monthly?

934
01:15:19,281 --> 01:15:21,318
You will be minting money!

935
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:25,789
That means, you will surely move
to some other place.

936
01:15:25,888 --> 01:15:26,832
Of course.

937
01:15:26,989 --> 01:15:28,093
So where are you planning to shift?

938
01:15:28,157 --> 01:15:32,401
To a place where there is enough
sunlight, air and water.

939
01:15:32,928 --> 01:15:33,929
But not seeping through the roof!

940
01:15:33,996 --> 01:15:35,304
Far from here...

941
01:15:43,839 --> 01:15:44,783
Hey Simmi...

942
01:15:49,878 --> 01:15:50,982
Will you give me your card?

943
01:15:52,014 --> 01:15:55,018
Your Business card?

944
01:15:55,417 --> 01:15:56,896
Sure, will give you one full box.

945
01:16:04,326 --> 01:16:06,431
Yeah. Dad.

946
01:16:06,895 --> 01:16:08,465
I was on my way for a meeting.

947
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:17,315
I will talk to you later.

948
01:16:17,873 --> 01:16:19,147
Hey Simmi. Wait!

949
01:16:21,276 --> 01:16:25,281
First she called me
here then leaves me here

950
01:16:27,749 --> 01:16:29,160
But she promised
me one full box!

951
01:16:50,505 --> 01:16:52,007
Dad, how come you're here?

952
01:16:54,042 --> 01:16:55,385
I had some work.

953
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:02,126
Dad I...

954
01:17:06,521 --> 01:17:08,330
No... Impossible!

955
01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:09,867
Please open.

956
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:11,794
Have you lost it?

957
01:17:11,927 --> 01:17:14,134
Why should I go and
meet your dad?

958
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:15,707
Just won't happen!

959
01:17:15,731 --> 01:17:16,402
Please.

960
01:17:16,431 --> 01:17:17,739
Go ask someone else...

961
01:17:17,766 --> 01:17:18,904
Whom should I ask to?

962
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:23,374
Why did you tell your dad that
I am your boyfriend?

963
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:25,841
And that I am a manager
In some big Companyl?!

964
01:17:25,908 --> 01:17:27,216
You are a 'Manager' aren't you?

965
01:17:27,743 --> 01:17:29,780
The company might be a bit different.

966
01:17:30,045 --> 01:17:31,888
Yeah right...Drama queen!

967
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:33,152
Enough. Leave the darned door.

968
01:17:33,282 --> 01:17:37,162
I so really want to
go for this interview

969
01:17:37,219 --> 01:17:39,825
I had to lie... else he would have
got me married to someone back home

970
01:17:39,888 --> 01:17:41,196
This is not right.

971
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:43,030
How can you make
anyone your 'Boyfriend'?

972
01:17:43,091 --> 01:17:44,764
But Jayanta...
You are not 'anyone'

973
01:17:45,861 --> 01:17:46,771
So who am I?

974
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:47,996
You are my neighbor.

975
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:50,999
Great! There are many neighbors upstairs.
Go get them... leave me alone.

976
01:17:51,066 --> 01:17:53,046
Jayanta... You are a friend.

977
01:17:53,735 --> 01:17:54,475
Am r?

978
01:17:54,803 --> 01:17:56,407
You are more than a friend.

979
01:17:57,072 --> 01:17:58,745
How much more?

980
01:17:58,874 --> 01:18:00,080
Have you forgotten that night?

981
01:18:02,978 --> 01:18:04,321
Yeah... When I was your dog!

982
01:18:04,913 --> 01:18:06,415
Jayanta... I am sorry.

983
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:09,854
Please Jayanta!

984
01:18:17,793 --> 01:18:18,999
Hey I can't take it anymore.

985
01:18:20,028 --> 01:18:21,405
I look like a fool.

986
01:18:22,264 --> 01:18:26,178
Hey Simi, listen!
Everyone is looking at me

987
01:18:27,069 --> 01:18:29,276
People in Mumbai have
no time for useless things

988
01:18:29,538 --> 01:18:31,848
Useless? You called me useless?

989
01:18:32,341 --> 01:18:34,480
useless?
Here, take your bag, I'm leaving!

990
01:18:34,843 --> 01:18:36,049
I am not interested
in wearing a rented suit.

991
01:18:36,111 --> 01:18:37,089
I'm going back home.

992
01:18:37,145 --> 01:18:38,852
I am so sorry.

993
01:18:39,881 --> 01:18:41,258

1003
01:19:19,888 --> 01:19:21,868
Why don't you let me speak
the way I want?

1004
01:19:22,057 --> 01:19:23,866
No. You have to mug it up.

1005
01:19:24,059 --> 01:19:26,164
Do you remember the lines
I taught you about the family?

1006
01:19:27,262 --> 01:19:28,263
Speak.

1007
01:19:31,967 --> 01:19:35,141
My elder brother owns a Restorantt
- It's restaurant

1008
01:19:36,772 --> 01:19:39,252
It has to be nasal.

1009
01:19:45,147 --> 01:19:46,455
How stupid!

1010
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:50,196
So what's the use
of an 'ANT' at the end?

1011
01:19:51,887 --> 01:19:54,424
If I were to drop the last 'A'
from my name.

1012
01:19:54,556 --> 01:19:56,797
Will people call me 'JAYON'?

1013
01:19:59,194 --> 01:20:00,036

01:20:27,289 --> 01:20:28,199
Good!

1026
01:20:28,323 --> 01:20:29,393
What nonsense!

1027
01:20:30,058 --> 01:20:33,232
Whenever you decide to get married,

1028
01:20:33,962 --> 01:20:35,805
Look for a decent guy.

1029
01:20:41,536 --> 01:20:43,106
There are no decent guys anymore.

1030
01:20:43,271 --> 01:20:44,443
You'll find them.

1031
01:20:44,906 --> 01:20:46,112
You definitely will.

1032
01:20:46,208 --> 01:20:47,243

I have left it somewhere.

1035
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:53,121
You should always wear it.

1036
01:20:53,281 --> 01:20:54,521
Otherwise you might run out of luck.

1037
01:20:54,783 --> 01:20:56,057
OK! I will.

1038
01:21:28,884 --> 01:21:29,885

I am sorry dad.

1047
01:21:54,209 --> 01:21:55,244
I am sorry too.

1048
01:21:55,443 --> 01:21:56,513
Who all are there in your family?

1049
01:21:57,179 --> 01:22:02,128
Right now... except me, all are home.

1050

01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:08,528
Simi. Please leave us alone.

1052
01:22:10,825 --> 01:22:12,031
You won't let him speak otherwise.

1053
01:22:12,394 --> 01:22:13,236
Dad please!

1054
01:22:13,328 --> 01:22:14,238

1055
01:22:21,503 --> 01:22:25,110
Abhimanyu!
You are so screwed

1056
01:22:27,075 --> 01:22:28,486
So... What do they do?

1057
01:22:28,843 --> 01:22:30,151
I am sorry... Who does what?

1058
01:22:30,212 --> 01:22:31,520
Your family members...

1059
01:22:38,853 --> 01:22:40,196
Sister-in-law owns a 'Restaurant'

1060
01:22:40,522 --> 01:22:43,401
Brother owns a beauty 'Salon'

1061
01:22:43,792 --> 01:22:45,135

And my dad is a housewife.

1063
01:22:54,369 --> 01:22:56,815
Ha Ha. Are you nervous?

1064
01:22:56,938 --> 01:23:02,445
Very much!
I am extremely nervous sir.

1065
01:23:03,011 --> 01:23:05,423
I don't know what's going on.

1066
01:23:06,381 --> 01:23:09,828
There is a cross connection
between my mental and vocal states.

1067
01:23:10,552 --> 01:23:15,092
You don't look like an introvert.

1068
01:23:16,291 --> 01:23:17,292
But I am impressed...

1069
01:23:18,260 --> 01:23:21,901
There's something nice about you,
Something honest

1070
01:23:23,164 --> 01:23:24,165
Really?

1071
01:23:24,799 --> 01:23:25,743
Cheers!

1072
01:23:28,870 --> 01:23:30,474
So what are your thoughts on marriage?

1073
01:23:33,808 --> 01:23:37,381
Marriage? I haven't thought about it.

1074
01:23:37,879 --> 01:23:38,857
What?

1075
01:23:39,381 --> 01:23:42,851
Sir, I meant...
We need some time to settle.

1076
01:23:42,984 --> 01:23:44,088
Nothing doing.

1077
01:23:44,219 --> 01:23:46,358
I want you to get married in one year.

1078
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:49,426
Cheers! [Laughs]
- Cheers!

1079
01:23:55,864 --> 01:23:58,811
Marriage? Holy Mother...
It's a bad world Jayanta.

1080
01:23:59,134 --> 01:24:02,206
Hey! Are you out of your head?

1081
01:24:02,504 --> 01:24:04,415
You left me alone with your dad.

1082
01:24:05,206 --> 01:24:07,186
<i>Your dad was ripping me apart.</i>

1083
01:24:07,309 --> 01:24:09,516
He was asking about me
and our wedding.

1084
01:24:10,078 --> 01:24:11,113
What a mess.

1085
01:24:12,113 --> 01:24:15,026
I think your Dad really likes me.

1086
01:24:15,917 --> 01:24:16,918
Yeah Right.

1087
01:24:17,152 --> 01:24:18,062
What 'Yeah Right?'

1088
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:21,426
He has given us one year
to get married.

1089
01:24:21,756 --> 01:24:22,826
Go fix a date.

1090
01:24:23,024 --> 01:24:23,934
Print a wedding card too.

1091
01:24:24,092 --> 01:24:25,901
Go... He is calling you.

1092
01:24:26,227 --> 01:24:29,265
Hey... What if we tell him,
we will get married in one year?

1093
01:24:29,397 --> 01:24:31,138
Hey! Are you crazy?

1094
01:24:31,366 --> 01:24:33,039
I don't want to be a part of this.

1095
01:24:33,201 --> 01:24:35,238
What's wrong in just saying?

1096
01:24:36,037 --> 01:24:37,948
You are so sweet to others.

1097
01:24:38,973 --> 01:24:41,852
So why do you act
Like a witch in front of me?

1098
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:43,321
Because, I am not scared of you.

1099
01:24:44,245 --> 01:24:45,246
Say it again

1100
01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:47,282
I am not scared of you.

1101
01:24:47,349 --> 01:24:48,760
Hey Bubble gum.

1102
01:24:49,317 --> 01:24:50,523
Won't take me a second

1103
01:24:50,852 --> 01:24:51,853
To burst your bubble.

1104
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:54,022
Oh! Come on...

1105
01:24:57,258 --> 01:24:59,363
Give me your best shot!

1106
01:25:00,295 --> 01:25:02,935
Best Shot? is it?

1107
01:29:48,249 --> 01:29:49,819
Hey... Stop it.

1108
01:29:49,884 --> 01:29:51,227
Come on clear this place.

1109
01:29:51,285 --> 01:29:52,320
Hey get up!

1110
01:29:52,387 --> 01:29:53,832
Sir. What's the matter?

1111
01:29:53,888 --> 01:29:55,196
Hey! Don't mess with us?

1112
01:29:55,423 --> 01:29:58,063
We have the info that you are selling
fake liquor here.

1113
01:29:58,126 --> 01:30:00,163
Search every corner of this bar.

1114
01:30:01,095 --> 01:30:02,904
You shut up and come with us.

1115
01:30:19,380 --> 01:30:21,223
Hello. Jayanta Speaking.

1116
01:30:21,349 --> 01:30:22,157
Tell me.

1117
01:30:22,216 --> 01:30:23,126
Hey! Jayanta.

1118
01:30:23,184 --> 01:30:24,185
What have you done?

1119
01:30:25,987 --> 01:30:26,897
How did you get to know?

1120
01:30:26,988 --> 01:30:29,491
How will I not come to know?

1121
01:30:29,957 --> 01:30:31,368
They have raided our bar.

1122
01:30:31,826 --> 01:30:32,770
Raid?

1123
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:36,169
Who told you to trash Pandian's men?

1124
01:30:36,397 --> 01:30:38,775
He's had our license cancelled.

1125
01:30:39,233 --> 01:30:41,440
And he has only one condition.

1126
01:30:41,803 --> 01:30:43,908
And now clear your earwax and
listen.

1127
01:30:44,138 --> 01:30:50,384
Pandian said, he is not going to budge
until you fall at his feet <i>&</i> apologize.

1128
01:30:51,045 --> 01:30:51,955
Huh!

1129
01:30:52,313 --> 01:30:53,223
What Huh!?

1130
01:30:53,781 --> 01:30:54,486
Where the hell are you?

1131
01:30:54,982 --> 01:30:58,088
I want you to come here right now!

1132
01:30:59,220 --> 01:31:00,096
I am not coming.

1133
01:31:00,321 --> 01:31:01,459
What do you mean you can't come?

1134
01:31:01,789 --> 01:31:03,097
Have you lost your mind?

1135
01:31:03,157 --> 01:31:06,832
Hey punk. I am busy.

1136
01:31:07,462 --> 01:31:08,805
Damn it!

1137
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:13,870
Hell!

1138
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:56,185
Hello. Why did you hit us?

1139
01:31:58,179 --> 01:32:00,455
I am sorry brother.

1140
01:32:00,815 --> 01:32:02,453
It was unintentional.

1141
01:32:02,517 --> 01:32:03,825
We would've got injured.

1142
01:32:03,885 --> 01:32:05,057
It didn't hit you

1143
01:32:05,153 --> 01:32:06,223
So forget it please.

1144
01:32:06,387 --> 01:32:07,422
Hey... Who are you staring at?

1145
01:32:07,555 --> 01:32:09,034
Do you know who we are?

1146
01:32:09,090 --> 01:32:11,263
Are you new here?

1147
01:32:38,286 --> 01:32:39,856

1148
01:33:38,045 --> 01:33:39,456

1149
01:33:41,282 --> 01:33:42,488
Hey... Jayanta.

1150
01:33:44,252 --> 01:33:45,253
Where the hell were you yesterday?

1151
01:33:46,254 --> 01:33:47,961
I am asking you something.

1152
01:33:48,923 --> 01:33:49,924
So you not going to talk now... huh?

1153
01:33:50,224 --> 01:33:52,761
OK... Let me tell you where you going.

1154
01:33:52,994 --> 01:33:54,974
You are going straight
to Alex Pandian.

1155
01:33:56,163 --> 01:33:58,268
Go there and apologize
for your behavior.

1156
01:33:59,867 --> 01:34:02,177
lam talking to you...
Did you hear me?

1157
01:34:03,871 --> 01:34:06,249
I will not spare you.

1158
01:34:06,407 --> 01:34:08,250
Hey, leave me.

1159
01:34:08,476 --> 01:34:10,820
I will shoot you right away

1160
01:34:10,845 --> 01:34:12,290
Come on then, shoot me!

1161
01:34:12,346 --> 01:34:13,188
I will not spare you.

1162
01:34:13,247 --> 01:34:14,191
Hey... Hold on.

1163
01:34:14,315 --> 01:34:17,819
Datta! Put your gun down.

1164
01:34:39,807 --> 01:34:40,808
What is all this?

1165
01:34:43,344 --> 01:34:45,119
ls this how you want to become...
My right hand man?

1166
01:34:47,114 --> 01:34:49,094
Because of this impulsive
behavior of yours

1167
01:34:49,283 --> 01:34:52,287
I had to make Datta my right hand.

1168
01:34:54,822 --> 01:34:56,199
You look at yourself?

1169
01:34:58,459 --> 01:34:59,995
Do you have that spark in you?

1170
01:35:00,828 --> 01:35:02,535
Had I seen the spark in you...

1171
01:35:03,764 --> 01:35:06,404
...I wouldn't have
sent you to rot in Jail.

1172
01:35:10,771 --> 01:35:12,148
What are you staring at?

1173
01:35:14,308 --> 01:35:16,379
Get this point straight.

1174
01:35:17,178 --> 01:35:22,355
You have come this
far because of my pittance.

1175
01:35:27,488 --> 01:35:30,264

1176
01:36:30,918 --> 01:36:32,226

01:36:37,158 --> 01:36:40,833
You can forget about getting
Paid if you don't hurry up

1179
01:36:40,895 --> 01:36:42,067
Hey Mr. Slow Motion.

1180

Shut up!

1181
01:36:45,433 --> 01:36:46,844
What's going on?

1182
01:36:47,168 --> 01:36:48,875
The girl has moved out.

1183
01:36:49,403 --> 01:36:51,110
She said there was
some personal problem.

1184
01:36:51,939 --> 01:36:52,883
Just a moment please.

1185
01:36:52,940 --> 01:36:57,946
Yeah... I know our terrace
is always occupied by 'love birds'

1186
01:36:58,279 --> 01:37:01,920
I have told you so many times.

01:37:02,016 --> 01:37:04,018
Ya... I know.

1188
01:37:08,189 --> 01:37:09,293

Don't you have your own phone...Chief?

1195
01:37:26,340 --> 01:37:27,318
I broke it.

1196
01:37:28,375 --> 01:37:30,412
You can buy a new phone from
my brother's shop...

1197
01:37:30,711 --> 01:37:31,746
Just shut up and give it!

1198
01:37:34,381 --> 01:37:35,325

Hey... Simi, please don't hang up.

Hear me out.

1206
01:38:03,344 --> 01:38:07,815
I've messed up your life.

1207
01:38:08,449 --> 01:38:11,760
You made a huge mistake
by taking me home.

1208
01:38:13,854 --> 01:38:15,800
Now... You have a chance
to correct your mistake.

You will outshine everyone.

1212
01:38:29,303 --> 01:38:32,375
Simi... I know it very well...

1213
01:38:36,944 --> 01:38:40,892
I have seen enough in life.

1214
01:38:42,049 --> 01:38:46,020
To tell good from bad,
you are good, Simi.

1215
01:38:47,321 --> 01:38:48,823
I know you Simi.

1216
01:38:50,457 --> 01:38:52,994
I know you inside out.

1217
01:39:01,035 --> 01:39:04,983
How do I make you understand?

1218
01:39:05,839 --> 01:39:07,182
You're running out of time.

1219
01:39:08,075 --> 01:39:09,850
You have just four hours left,

1220
01:39:10,311 --> 01:39:12,086

I know you will.

1225
01:39:49,550 --> 01:39:50,893
Hey... Watch out!

1226
01:39:52,286 --> 01:39:53,492
Are you done with your call?

1227
01:39:53,988 --> 01:39:57,299
If you want to buy a new phone,
do visit my brother's shop.

1228
01:40:05,266 --> 01:40:06,244

1229

He must apologize to Pandian,
If we want our bar license back!

1234
01:40:16,944 --> 01:40:17,922
What happened?

1235
01:40:17,978 --> 01:40:19,150
He is not here.

1236
01:40:21,882 --> 01:40:23,953
Only Altaaf chief
can set him straight.

1237
01:40:53,881 --> 01:40:54,859
Dad... Pls. don't stop me today.

1238
01:40:55,049 --> 01:40:57,290
I have struggled a
lot to reach this stage.

1239
01:40:57,985 --> 01:41:00,989

01:41:35,089 --> 01:41:36,432
He is going to get us screwed.

And... Madhura Joshi

1265
01:43:03,877 --> 01:43:05,823
Madam...
What's the time?

1266
01:43:06,280 --> 01:43:07,315
Sir... It's 1:40

1267
01:43:11,251 --> 01:43:12,787
Good afternoon Ladies <i>&</i> Gentlemen

1268
01:43:12,853 --> 01:43:13,957
Good afternoon sir...

1269
01:43:14,288 --> 01:43:19,288
Today, out of you six, we will pick
one ideal candidate, for our company.

1270
01:43:26,300 --> 01:43:28,746
Mumbai passengers,
please get down.

1271
01:43:36,243 --> 01:43:38,484
A synergic approach will
solve all these problems.

1272
01:43:38,745 --> 01:43:40,053
Financial and technical.

1273
01:43:40,180 --> 01:43:41,454
And what do you feel?

1274
01:43:42,883 --> 01:43:43,486
Me?

1275
01:43:43,784 --> 01:43:44,762
Yeah!

1276
01:43:45,018 --> 01:43:46,258
I feel a shock. Its shocking!

1277
01:43:49,289 --> 01:43:51,428
This is the most pathetic idea ever.

1278
01:43:52,860 --> 01:43:55,136
It doesn't make any sense,

1279
01:43:55,195 --> 01:43:56,765
The idea is of no use, if a
common man like me doesn't understand.

1280
01:43:56,797 --> 01:43:57,502
To hell with such ideas!

1281
01:43:57,764 --> 01:43:58,469
EXCUSE ME!

1282
01:43:58,532 --> 01:43:59,909
Why should I excuse you?

1283
01:44:00,767 --> 01:44:02,246
Do you want to take a piss?

1284
01:44:06,507 --> 01:44:07,952
Pls hurry up.

1285
01:44:09,409 --> 01:44:11,889
Gentleman... Do you have
any idea about what you are doing?

1286
01:44:12,012 --> 01:44:12,922
Me?

1287
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:15,287
I do nothing... only bullying!

1288
01:44:15,415 --> 01:44:17,292
I have been a good for nothing
all my life.

1289
01:44:17,484 --> 01:44:20,431
And when I tried doing something...
I have fallen on my face.

1290
01:44:21,421 --> 01:44:24,334
Sir there is a mistake...
Let me call the security.

1291
01:44:24,424 --> 01:44:27,337
Hold on dude...
I'll smash your face right here.

1292
01:44:27,728 --> 01:44:29,730
You guys, come on leave now.

1293
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:36,243
Hello you 'Tie-boy' get going now.

1294
01:44:36,737 --> 01:44:38,341
Are you waiting for
my special invitation?

1295
01:44:40,073 --> 01:44:42,747
There is a mad man inside.
Pls. call the security.

1296
01:44:43,076 --> 01:44:44,214
Hello. Security!

1297
01:44:47,748 --> 01:44:48,453
Excuse me sir.

1298
01:44:48,515 --> 01:44:50,017
Hey! Shut up!

1299
01:44:51,018 --> 01:44:52,224
I want you all to
keep your mouth shut.

1300
01:44:52,286 --> 01:44:54,357
And you...
If you dare to touch the phone

1301
01:44:54,421 --> 01:44:56,230
I will break your finger
and shove it up yours.

1302
01:44:56,290 --> 01:44:58,429
You'll keep looking for it.

1303
01:45:14,007 --> 01:45:15,884
‘Simi... Where are you?‘

1304
01:45:25,953 --> 01:45:27,159
Be quick... Open the door.

1305
01:45:29,823 --> 01:45:32,736
Hey. Tough guys touch me,
at your own risk

1306
01:45:32,759 --> 01:45:37,333
Hold on. Please leave him.

1307
01:45:39,733 --> 01:45:41,474
I just want to know...

1308
01:45:41,802 --> 01:45:43,338
Why did you do all of this?
What do you want?

1309
01:45:43,804 --> 01:45:45,750
Sir. Please don't take me wrong.

1310
01:45:46,206 --> 01:45:51,451
I've tried to do just one
right thing in my life.

1311
01:45:57,017 --> 01:45:58,496
Excuse me.

1312
01:46:03,390 --> 01:46:10,535
I beg of you to give
me a few more minutes.

1313
01:46:20,941 --> 01:46:23,717
I have ruined this person's life.

1314
01:46:24,444 --> 01:46:31,453
I want few more minutes,
to make good for lost time.

1315
01:46:35,055 --> 01:46:39,128
I want to do something right... by doing
at least one good deed in my life.

1316
01:46:41,328 --> 01:46:43,035
I'm sorry I can't help you

1317
01:46:48,835 --> 01:46:50,007
Thank you sir...

1318
01:46:51,204 --> 01:46:55,175
I am glad, even if I didn't succeed,
That my attempt was genuine.

1319
01:46:57,878 --> 01:46:58,856
Take him away.

1320
01:47:03,784 --> 01:47:06,287
Oh Simi... Where are you?

1321
01:47:11,992 --> 01:47:13,232
Crazy man!

1322
01:47:14,294 --> 01:47:15,329
Mamta,
- Yes Sir.

1323
01:47:15,395 --> 01:47:16,806
Kindly call the candidates back.

1324
01:47:16,863 --> 01:47:17,739
Sure sir.

1325
01:47:22,335 --> 01:47:23,336
Move on.

1326
01:47:27,941 --> 01:47:30,717
Move on I say.

1327
01:47:34,715 --> 01:47:35,750
Take your hands off.

1328
01:48:10,784 --> 01:48:12,161
Shantanu Sharma

1329
01:48:12,452 --> 01:48:13,453
Nikita Agarwal

1330
01:48:13,854 --> 01:48:14,992
Kamal Sandhu

1331
01:48:15,155 --> 01:48:16,463
Simrin Hemant Desai

1332
01:48:16,523 --> 01:48:18,093
Aniket Salvi

1333
01:48:18,158 --> 01:48:19,899
And... Madhura Joshi

1334
01:48:32,305 --> 01:48:33,784
Where the hell were you?

1335
01:48:34,174 --> 01:48:36,484
Do you want us to shut down?
ls that what you want?

1336
01:48:37,778 --> 01:48:39,815
Why are you acting so stubborn?

1337
01:48:40,046 --> 01:48:42,253
Pandian has made our lives miserable.

1338
01:48:42,315 --> 01:48:43,521
So let's teach him a lesson.

1339
01:48:44,384 --> 01:48:45,454
Let's finish him off.

1340
01:48:46,319 --> 01:48:48,162
Everyone will fall in place.

1341
01:48:48,455 --> 01:48:50,162
We can claim our lost glory.

1342
01:48:50,357 --> 01:48:51,335
Hey!!

1343
01:48:51,958 --> 01:48:52,868
Hold on chief.

1344
01:48:54,261 --> 01:48:55,433
Jayanta is right this time!

1345
01:48:55,796 --> 01:48:56,536
What nonsensel!

1346
01:48:56,830 --> 01:48:57,900
Are you out of your head?

1347
01:48:58,532 --> 01:48:59,408
it's not a cake walk.

1348
01:48:59,466 --> 01:49:00,809
I will bump him off.

1349
01:49:01,268 --> 01:49:06,115
I will kill him
and within the next 24 hours.

1350
01:49:06,339 --> 01:49:08,819
Ok. You kill Pandian.

1351
01:49:09,943 --> 01:49:12,480
But someone else will take the rap.

1352
01:49:13,947 --> 01:49:17,053
Your newbie Kunal will take the rap.

1353
01:49:18,952 --> 01:49:23,298
And when he comes out of the jail
I wil make him your right hand man.

1354
01:49:38,338 --> 01:49:39,976
Chief...

1355
01:49:41,975 --> 01:49:49,484
You've always felt that I have come
this far because of your pittance. Right?

1356
01:49:51,852 --> 01:49:54,196
Today I will settle everything.

1357
01:49:55,422 --> 01:50:03,000
I will pay off all my debts...Today!

1358
01:51:36,122 --> 01:51:43,040
Chief... I am very nervous today
Also, I am very excited.

1359
01:51:43,263 --> 01:51:46,870
Kunnu... Always remember...

1360
01:51:47,400 --> 01:51:51,849
Any act that gives you a Chill and
a Thrill... is very dangerous.

1361
01:51:52,372 --> 01:51:54,352
Chief... I hope you have your gun?

1362
01:51:54,474 --> 01:51:55,316
Nope.

1363
01:51:55,375 --> 01:51:56,149
You don't ?

1364
01:51:57,811 --> 01:51:58,915
I have this.

1365
01:52:01,815 --> 01:52:03,886
Chief...
- What's wrong with you?

1366
01:52:05,185 --> 01:52:07,062
You want to be like me?

1367
01:52:08,088 --> 01:52:09,533
Chief... Why are you hitting me?

1368
01:52:11,291 --> 01:52:15,762
You want to be a gangster like me?

1369
01:52:16,062 --> 01:52:19,373
I hate myself for being what I am...
And you want to follow my steps?

1370
01:52:22,469 --> 01:52:27,077
I want you to quit
all of this right away!

1371
01:52:27,374 --> 01:52:30,253
if you don't take up a respectable
job, I will bash you up

1372
01:52:32,812 --> 01:52:35,793
In this line of business...

1373
01:52:36,016 --> 01:52:38,360
You will cut short your lifeline.

1374
01:52:38,918 --> 01:52:42,092
Everyone pretends to be a brother. But
all they do is back stab each other.

1375
01:52:42,355 --> 01:52:44,232
Do you understand?

1376
01:52:47,060 --> 01:52:53,807
I am never going back to Altaf.

1377
01:52:54,401 --> 01:52:59,077
But if I ever see you back there...

1378
01:52:59,839 --> 01:53:03,184
I swear... I will not spare you.

1379
01:53:03,243 --> 01:53:05,086
No chief...

1380
01:53:50,857 --> 01:53:53,064
Hey... You slow coaches.

1381
01:53:53,426 --> 01:53:56,134
How do we stan the theatre by DIWALI,
if you work at this speed?

1382
01:54:09,075 --> 01:54:12,989
Why do I always have to drill my point
Into that thick skull of yours asshole

1383
01:54:14,247 --> 01:54:18,389
OK... Start the work from tomorrow

1384
01:54:37,170 --> 01:54:40,014
Oh! it's you...
What are you doing here?

1385
01:54:40,140 --> 01:54:44,111
You wanted my apology right?
I have come to apologize

1386
01:54:44,744 --> 01:54:46,746
Come tomorrow... I am busy now.

1387
01:54:48,214 --> 01:54:52,856
I am sorry. I will apologize today...

1388
01:54:55,054 --> 01:54:58,524
This will be my last apology.

1389
01:55:15,475 --> 01:55:16,453
Oh my dear boy...

1390
01:55:17,410 --> 01:55:18,286
Are you angry?

1391
01:55:19,145 --> 01:55:20,818
You think you are a stud?

1392
01:55:31,191 --> 01:55:35,970
Not like that.
It should be this way.

1393
01:55:39,899 --> 01:55:49,786
Sorry... I am sorry...
Did it ring in your ears?

1394
01:56:40,093 --> 01:56:44,235
You look just like ‘Juhi Chawla‘ (Actress)
from the film 'Darr'

1395
01:56:48,067 --> 01:56:49,808
Damn Corrupt... suspended cop!

1396
01:56:50,470 --> 01:56:51,847
What do you have to say?

1397
01:56:53,439 --> 01:56:54,383
Do you want to hit me?

1398
01:56:55,074 --> 01:56:57,145
Come on... Go ahead!

1399
01:57:00,346 --> 01:57:04,761
So now... do you want to run off?

1400
01:57:04,984 --> 01:57:07,897
Or want me to finish you off?

1401
01:59:11,244 --> 01:59:14,384
Please take care of my Simi.

1402
01:59:41,374 --> 01:59:43,115
You have seen the entire office.

1403
01:59:43,409 --> 01:59:45,787
Now I will introduce you all to someone...

1404
01:59:45,978 --> 01:59:48,549
Six months ago...
She was like one of you.

1405
01:59:48,981 --> 01:59:53,361
Today is our IT Head'.

1406
02:00:00,293 --> 02:00:01,237
May I come in?

1407
02:00:01,561 --> 02:00:02,869
Please come in.

1408
02:00:05,431 --> 02:00:06,535
Please come in.

1409
02:00:12,538 --> 02:00:13,744
They are your new recruits.

1410
02:00:13,940 --> 02:00:14,816
Hello guys!

1411
02:00:15,842 --> 02:00:18,789
Good to have you guys on board.
Looking forward to working with you.

1412
02:00:18,878 --> 02:00:20,084
Thank you madam.

1413
02:00:20,746 --> 02:00:23,226
I can't believe my luck.

1414
02:00:23,282 --> 02:00:26,786
I got the job...
two promotions in just six months.

1415
02:00:30,790 --> 02:00:32,167
Since the day of interview...

1416
02:00:32,225 --> 02:00:33,203
I have not seen that one person...

1417
02:00:33,259 --> 02:00:34,363
The one who helped me
to achieve all of this.

1418
02:00:34,827 --> 02:00:39,003
My eyes keep looking for him.
But can never see him

1419
02:00:39,765 --> 02:00:44,441
I see him only in my dreams.

1420
02:00:46,439 --> 02:00:47,509
Hey.. Tennn....

1421
02:00:48,074 --> 02:00:49,246
I mean Simi...

1422
02:00:49,809 --> 02:00:51,482
Your house is so beautiful.

1423
02:00:52,278 --> 02:00:53,985
Just the way you wanted.

1424
02:00:54,180 --> 02:01:00,825
Bright, airy with ample water...
Flowing from the taps and not the roofs.

1425
02:01:07,393 --> 02:01:11,466
Simi...Do you remember your promise?

1426
02:01:11,931 --> 02:01:12,807
What?

1427
02:01:14,333 --> 02:01:16,472
You promised to give me your visiting card.

1428
02:01:18,170 --> 02:01:20,480
Yeah! I promised... not just one...
I promised you one full box.

1429
02:01:20,806 --> 02:01:26,449
Manager?
Holy Mother... blessing!

1430
02:01:28,114 --> 02:01:29,422
You haven't changed a bit...!

1431
02:01:29,515 --> 02:01:34,225
You too... You still look the same... HOT!

1432
02:01:34,420 --> 02:01:39,420
But my life, my world looks
Incomplete without you... Jayanta

1433
02:01:48,234 --> 02:01:53,377
Take a deep breath.

1434
02:02:09,822 --> 02:02:14,862
I wish I could tell him this.

1435
02:02:14,994 --> 02:02:20,808
I cannot live without him
That's how much I love him

1436
02:02:22,101 --> 02:02:23,478
I just love him.

1437
02:02:24,236 --> 02:02:25,806
Only once.
