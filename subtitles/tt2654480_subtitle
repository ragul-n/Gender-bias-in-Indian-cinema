1
00:03:48,193 --> 00:03:52,642
It seems you're donating entire
collection to Archana charitable trust.

2
00:03:54,332 --> 00:03:55,174
Why aren't you doing
sequel of Kanchana-Z'?

3
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,708
Ask Lawrence.

4
00:03:57,202 --> 00:03:58,476
It seems you're having an affair
with cricketer Sreesanth.

5
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,648
Please answer, madam.

6
00:04:20,192 --> 00:04:20,670
Order kebabs.

7
00:04:20,892 --> 00:04:22,735
Ordering kebabs in star hotel?

8
00:04:29,434 --> 00:04:30,742
Didn't I tell you madam
is more beautiful off screen?

9
00:04:31,203 --> 00:04:33,342
Look at her complexion!
Contrast com pared to me.

10
00:04:33,572 --> 00:04:36,348
She's making me go crazy!
- Who are you?

11
00:04:37,309 --> 00:04:40,347
They said it's a charity show!
But I don't see any crowd!

12
00:04:40,545 --> 00:04:43,355
Am I to perform here?
- Here!

13
00:04:48,386 --> 00:04:51,367
You've to perform before us.

14
00:04:52,324 --> 00:04:55,703
I had promised you as gift
for my bachelor's party.

15
00:04:56,228 --> 00:04:57,536
You won't agree
if I ask directly,

16
00:04:57,729 --> 00:04:59,868
so, this drama of event
and charity!

17
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:06,710
Wear this two piece and
get into the pool quickly!

18
00:05:06,905 --> 00:05:08,885
I'll pay as much as you demand!

19
00:05:10,675 --> 00:05:11,881
Are you mad?

20
00:05:12,344 --> 00:05:14,381
You said it was orphans...
- We too are orphans!

21
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:16,581
We've drinks and
chicken as side dish,

22
00:05:16,815 --> 00:05:19,796
but we're itching for
female partners for <i>3</i> months!

23
00:05:20,018 --> 00:05:21,258
Are there worse orphans than us?

24
00:05:21,486 --> 00:05:22,464
Why don't you understand us?

25
00:05:22,687 --> 00:05:26,225
No more talk,
I'll take care of her

26
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:27,737
Stop..stop..

27
00:05:59,724 --> 00:06:01,761
<i>Rs heroine Lakshmi Rah!</i>

28
00:06:03,528 --> 00:06:05,303
Kanchana film heroine!

29
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,635
We're recovery agents
of lCICl bank.

30
00:06:07,866 --> 00:06:09,607
Entire group is your fan!

31
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:12,281
Is it film shoot?
Chasing scene?

32
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,505
It's not film shoot,

33
00:06:13,738 --> 00:06:16,776
they called me for charity show
and trying to molest me.

34
00:06:19,311 --> 00:06:21,313
These boys?

35
00:06:21,546 --> 00:06:23,321
This ground is mine and
this property is mine.

36
00:06:23,548 --> 00:06:27,462
If they know my background,
they'll escape without trace.

37
00:06:28,753 --> 00:06:32,326
Make a scene like in films but
no one would come to save you.

38
00:06:32,557 --> 00:06:33,968
No hero would come!

39
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:35,861
<i>Come, Lakshmi Rah!</i>

40
00:06:36,094 --> 00:06:39,667
Hey black and white!
I'm there to save the girl!

41
00:06:39,898 --> 00:06:41,878
Is there anyone to save you?

42
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,809
Who is that?
- Is it you?

43
00:06:46,671 --> 00:06:48,344
You?
- Not me!

44
00:06:48,573 --> 00:06:51,349
Did you tell that?
- We aren't that brave!

45
00:06:51,576 --> 00:06:54,352
To say something brave!
To do what he says!

46
00:06:54,579 --> 00:06:56,991
There's only one man!
Look there!

47
00:07:13,932 --> 00:07:15,673
Who are you?

48
00:07:16,601 --> 00:07:18,842
Shall I deliver dialogue first
or bash you first?

49
00:07:19,037 --> 00:07:20,675
Both will have punches!

50
00:07:21,706 --> 00:07:23,583
Wait for counter dialogues.

51
00:07:23,808 --> 00:07:24,912
Clear off the ground in 2 minutes.

52
00:07:25,143 --> 00:07:29,523
Brother! We entered the ground
without knowing it was you!

53
00:07:29,714 --> 00:07:31,523
I feel you'd bash us black and blue!

54
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,730
Brother! Madam...madam...
please forgive me.

55
00:07:33,952 --> 00:07:36,398
Brother! She has forgiven me!

56
00:07:36,621 --> 00:07:38,532
Brother, tell him not to beat me.

57
00:07:38,757 --> 00:07:41,863
Please forgive me, brother!

58
00:07:46,631 --> 00:07:47,939
Hey software!

59
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,611
Instead of enjoying Saturday
and Sunday happily,

60
00:07:49,834 --> 00:07:54,078
why are you giving pose
with bat and tie?

61
00:07:54,506 --> 00:07:58,044
You're Sachin, he's Ganguly
and he's Dhoni!

62
00:07:58,743 --> 00:08:01,053
I'll take her now,

63
00:08:01,513 --> 00:08:02,958
let me see
who would dare stop me!

64
00:08:21,433 --> 00:08:25,108
If I beat casually,
you'd be in casualty ward,

65
00:08:25,537 --> 00:08:29,075
if I concentrate and beat...
you'd go into coma!

66
00:09:36,674 --> 00:09:39,484
He's not software,
he's beating like hardware.

67
00:09:46,084 --> 00:09:47,825
Let's take care of him later.

68
00:09:50,188 --> 00:09:51,496
Thank you so much.

69
00:09:54,092 --> 00:09:57,005
You should've come with security
for such events, right?

70
00:09:57,195 --> 00:09:59,835
I didn't expect this.

71
00:10:01,866 --> 00:10:04,005
I want to give you a treat!

72
00:10:19,651 --> 00:10:22,689
My name is Lucky Rai...

73
00:10:22,887 --> 00:10:26,528
My beauty is ravishing,
I'm from Mumbai...

74
00:10:39,671 --> 00:10:43,118
Take chances...
come, my chilly...

75
00:10:43,575 --> 00:10:46,112
My silk long skirt
dropped on seeing you...

76
00:10:46,578 --> 00:10:49,787
I'm a good boy...
- I fell for your whistle...

77
00:10:50,014 --> 00:10:53,052
I'm free soul without reins...
- Fell for your adventurous nature...

78
00:10:53,251 --> 00:10:56,596
Your film is fantastic...
It'll have a silver jubilee run...

79
00:10:56,821 --> 00:11:00,735
You're the owner of
my touring talkies...

80
00:11:48,072 --> 00:11:54,648
Won't the box office of beauty
shake up for your razor sharp eyes?

81
00:11:54,879 --> 00:12:01,194
If a poster like you comes,
there won't be any censor...

82
00:12:01,686 --> 00:12:07,864
If you praise me like that...
Body heat would jump the fence...

83
00:12:08,092 --> 00:12:11,198
Get into action and
tear my ticket of shyness..

84
00:12:11,763 --> 00:12:15,301
I'm not for it, my dear girl...

85
00:12:49,367 --> 00:12:55,909
Attracted by the arrogance in you...
My heart skipped a beat...

86
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:02,716
Enamored by your bravery,
I'm madly after you...

87
00:13:02,947 --> 00:13:09,387
Hey girl, don't fall on me...
I'm not the right man for you...

88
00:13:09,887 --> 00:13:12,731
I've come to you on my own,
why are you backing off?

89
00:13:12,957 --> 00:13:16,871
Whatever you may say,
water and fire won't sync well...

90
00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:49,961
What?
- Your father has been arrested.

91
00:13:50,194 --> 00:13:52,299
Is it?
- He's in Ashok Nagar police station.

92
00:13:55,933 --> 00:13:57,435
Dirty rogues!

93
00:13:57,869 --> 00:13:59,109
Will you create nuisance
selling tickets in black market?

94
00:13:59,337 --> 00:14:03,979
Nuisance! I'll kill all of you!

95
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:04,913
You've a phone call, sir.

96
00:14:05,143 --> 00:14:06,747
One minute? You bend down.

97
00:14:07,345 --> 00:14:09,450
Brother-in-law, cinema is super hit.

98
00:14:09,881 --> 00:14:11,451
I'm in mother-in-law's place,
I'll call you later.

99
00:14:11,883 --> 00:14:12,452
Cut it.

100
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:15,260
Are you in mother-in-law's place?
I'm your father-in-law!

101
00:14:15,453 --> 00:14:17,262
What do you want?

102
00:14:17,455 --> 00:14:21,335
Do you want Vada or pudding?
Do you want Bisi Bela bath?

103
00:14:26,164 --> 00:14:30,806
Cl, sir!
- What?

104
00:14:31,035 --> 00:14:32,446
That is...
- What's it?

105
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:35,280
It seems you arrested my father.
- Who is your father?

106
00:14:35,506 --> 00:14:37,816
Mohan Rao?
What a father you have?

107
00:14:40,244 --> 00:14:41,951
We'll tell little kids with love.

108
00:14:42,246 --> 00:14:44,021
We'll use stick for young men.

109
00:14:44,248 --> 00:14:47,024
He's like Bahubali in
Shravanabelagola,

110
00:14:47,251 --> 00:14:50,289
How am Ito tell him?
Bring him.

111
00:14:59,397 --> 00:15:00,467
You're fine, right?

112
00:15:01,165 --> 00:15:02,974
How could you arrest such
an innocent man?

113
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,510
Who is innocent?

114
00:15:04,936 --> 00:15:08,042
Rogue! Wastrel! Rascal!

115
00:15:08,272 --> 00:15:09,808
All put together is his father.

116
00:15:10,007 --> 00:15:12,817
What was his crime anyway?
- Eve teasing!

117
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:16,849
Eve teasing at this old age?
- Isn't it?

118
00:15:17,081 --> 00:15:21,826
Leelavathi, draw a box and show
his father's romantic ploys!

119
00:15:24,288 --> 00:15:26,825
Did you see chicks here?

120
00:15:27,024 --> 00:15:29,527
Did you wake me up early
morning to see these chicks?

121
00:15:29,961 --> 00:15:32,407
I've books with more
beautiful chicks than these.

122
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,166
My hands, my pleasure!

123
00:15:37,535 --> 00:15:39,879
Eve teasing is crime legally.

124
00:15:40,104 --> 00:15:43,347
That's why I've camouflaged
it as jogging. Let's go.

125
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,857
You've accepted the flower,
won't you give your phone number?

126
00:15:51,983 --> 00:15:53,894
Forget it!
Will you take my phone number?

127
00:15:54,118 --> 00:15:57,361
If you give your Facebook ID,
I'll send friendship request.

128
00:15:57,555 --> 00:15:58,898
Itching for trouble?

129
00:15:59,123 --> 00:16:00,033
Do you know who my father is?

130
00:16:00,224 --> 00:16:02,204
This area Cl!
- Cl?

131
00:16:05,229 --> 00:16:10,872
Many Cl's will come and go,
but I'm local, permanent.

132
00:16:11,068 --> 00:16:13,048
Taunting me! Wait a minute.

133
00:16:13,237 --> 00:16:17,117
Won't Cl's have daughters?
Won't they have Facebook accounts?

134
00:16:17,341 --> 00:16:18,877
Won't they get friendship requests?

135
00:16:19,076 --> 00:16:20,521
Won't they marry.'
Won't they have husbands?

136
00:16:20,945 --> 00:16:22,583
Here they are!
- Where?

137
00:16:23,014 --> 00:16:24,925
We've come with full arrangements.

138
00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:29,063
Do you want Facebook ID?

139
00:16:30,955 --> 00:16:32,593
If you come with me,

140
00:16:33,024 --> 00:16:39,407
let's sit and open Facebook,
Twitter, Fitter, HR accounts.

141
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:42,076
By the way, who are you, sir?
- Her father!

142
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,605
Bloody! How dare you
tease my daughter!

143
00:16:45,036 --> 00:16:47,277
Do you consider yourself
Ravi Teja of film 'ldiot'?

144
00:16:47,505 --> 00:16:49,917
Get him into the vehicle.
- Get in!

145
00:16:50,308 --> 00:16:53,585
You said, let's go!
Got the stick now?

146
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,617
That's it!

147
00:16:57,048 --> 00:17:01,292
He's after girls,
what does he want from them?

148
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,157
He's after them not with
any bad intention,

149
00:17:03,387 --> 00:17:04,593
he's after them for matches!

150
00:17:05,389 --> 00:17:08,632
Is your father Sachin Tendulkar
to go around with a bat?

151
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:12,633
Not that matches,
he's searching bride for his son.

152
00:17:13,064 --> 00:17:16,602
For brides he must approach
matrimonial sites,

153
00:17:17,001 --> 00:17:19,447
why is he after girls on roads?

154
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:21,308
I've done with it 6 months ago.

155
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:22,984
I brought two proposals every day!

156
00:17:23,207 --> 00:17:24,277
He rejected every proposal.

157
00:17:24,475 --> 00:17:25,510
That's why l had to take
to streets.

158
00:17:25,743 --> 00:17:27,654
At least you tell him , sir.
- Okay.

159
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,652
If your father goes after
Commissioner's daughter next time,

160
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,187
your marriage will
bring death to me.

161
00:17:33,417 --> 00:17:36,125
Marry some girl quickly,
take your father.

162
00:17:37,688 --> 00:17:39,531
I'm asking you finally,
will you stop this or not?

163
00:17:39,757 --> 00:17:44,331
I promised to fix your marriage,
so I'm searching for bride.

164
00:17:44,562 --> 00:17:45,199
Promise to find yourself,
I'll stop it.

165
00:17:45,429 --> 00:17:46,533
I don't like any girl you show.
What do you want me to do?

166
00:17:46,998 --> 00:17:50,639
World's most beautiful girls
are in Bangalore,

167
00:17:51,035 --> 00:17:52,013
what am I to do if you
don't like anyone?

168
00:17:52,236 --> 00:17:55,683
Yes, Aishwarya Rai, Lara Dutta,
Deepika Padukone, Anushka, long list...

169
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,018
What else do you want?

170
00:17:57,241 --> 00:17:59,152
Marriage isn't just about beauty,
it's about understanding too.

171
00:17:59,343 --> 00:18:00,481
Even if understanding is there,
I must have a connect, right?

172
00:18:00,678 --> 00:18:03,022
Okay, I'll continue
till you connect.

173
00:18:03,247 --> 00:18:05,227
I don't mind going to jail
or gallows!

174
00:18:05,449 --> 00:18:07,986
Are you a freedom fighter?
You're taking away my freedom too.

175
00:18:08,185 --> 00:18:10,495
If you don't tell him clearly your
choice of girl, what can he do?

176
00:18:10,688 --> 00:18:12,167
It's very difficult to tell.

177
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:13,562
It's about my feelings.

178
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:16,169
That's it!
Tell me those feelings!

179
00:18:16,594 --> 00:18:19,006
Bottom to top,
she must be electrifying!

180
00:18:19,196 --> 00:18:21,233
No current in homes,
how can she have it?

181
00:18:21,465 --> 00:18:23,570
You stop...you carry on.

182
00:18:23,801 --> 00:18:25,246
I must get vibrations in body.

183
00:18:25,469 --> 00:18:27,574
Bells must ring with DTS effect.

184
00:18:27,805 --> 00:18:29,682
Spot light must be on me!

185
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,244
I got it.

186
00:18:32,476 --> 00:18:33,511
What do you mean by spotlight?

187
00:18:33,711 --> 00:18:38,683
Nothing, stop going to colleges,
start visiting pubs and discos,

188
00:19:08,446 --> 00:19:10,722
Uncle...uncle!

189
00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:52,665
Enough dear!

190
00:19:53,124 --> 00:19:55,331
You danced crazily!
Let's relax now.

191
00:20:00,564 --> 00:20:03,340
It was too crazy today, uncle.

192
00:20:03,567 --> 00:20:06,810
Life is bore if lazy,
it's crazy if it rocks.

193
00:20:07,238 --> 00:20:08,774
I stole somebodys wallet.

194
00:20:09,573 --> 00:20:10,278
Come, let's go in car.

195
00:20:10,474 --> 00:20:14,354
Uncle, you finished all the
drinks in pub saying crazy.

196
00:20:14,578 --> 00:20:15,682
How are we to pay the bill?

197
00:20:15,913 --> 00:20:19,292
Paying bill is normal,
non-payment is crazy.

198
00:20:23,254 --> 00:20:24,289
Greetings boss!

199
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,126
Found a scapegoat!

200
00:20:33,864 --> 00:20:38,370
I'm Pavan Kalyan here.
- Pavan Kalyan?

201
00:20:38,602 --> 00:20:41,310
Pavan Kalyan means
Power Star Pavan Kalyan?

202
00:20:54,885 --> 00:20:56,489
Tell me, Power star Pavan Kalyan!

203
00:20:56,754 --> 00:20:58,734
Okay sir.

204
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:00,860
My girl friend is in your pub.

205
00:21:01,292 --> 00:21:04,671
Next to her is short, stocky
cute man with bald head.

206
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:08,342
Madam is here only,
I think bald man is in bathroom.

207
00:21:08,532 --> 00:21:10,876
Don't let them pay the bill,
I'll pay it myself.

208
00:21:11,302 --> 00:21:12,747
I'm a big fan of you, sir.

209
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:15,416
Will you pay the bill?
It's free for you, sir.

210
00:21:15,639 --> 00:21:17,676
If you're my fan,
watch my film twice.

211
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:20,412
If not visit my brother's
blood bank and donate blood.

212
00:21:20,644 --> 00:21:22,885
I don't like all this.

213
00:21:23,314 --> 00:21:25,760
You're great!
That's why we like you!

214
00:21:25,983 --> 00:21:29,430
Your character is perfect,
that's why I like you, sir.

215
00:21:29,653 --> 00:21:31,826
Don't praise me, I hate it.

216
00:21:32,256 --> 00:21:34,429
Okay sir, bye sir.

217
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:37,368
Why are you taking time
to present bill?

218
00:21:37,595 --> 00:21:38,699
You don't have to pay the bill.

219
00:21:38,896 --> 00:21:40,898
Pavan Kalyan called on phone,
he has promised to pay the bill.

220
00:21:41,332 --> 00:21:42,367
Who is he pay the bill?

221
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,376
How is he connected to my niece?
- Did he call here also?

222
00:21:45,569 --> 00:21:47,242
He's taking away all my freedom.

223
00:21:47,471 --> 00:21:48,882
Recently when I visited
a jewellary shop,

224
00:21:49,273 --> 00:21:51,549
he sent Rs.25 lakhs to them.

225
00:21:52,676 --> 00:21:55,247
His girl friend would be
worth that much, right?

226
00:21:55,479 --> 00:21:58,221
Will he all my bills
for my heart?

227
00:22:01,619 --> 00:22:03,394
<i>Stop..-stop..</i>

228
00:22:03,587 --> 00:22:05,794
PK is coming here,
play 'Kewu Keka' song!

229
00:22:06,023 --> 00:22:07,934
What's this commotion?
Why are they rushing out?

230
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:09,804
She's PK's girl friend.

231
00:22:10,027 --> 00:22:12,268
He has promised to pay the bill,
she's leaving angrily.

232
00:22:12,496 --> 00:22:14,271
Who is PK?
- Who PK is?

233
00:22:14,498 --> 00:22:16,409
Are you running pub without
knowing who PK is?

234
00:22:16,634 --> 00:22:19,945
PK means Pavan Kalyan!
Pavan Kalyan means honesty!

235
00:22:20,371 --> 00:22:21,941
If he's near,
you feel like kissing him,

236
00:22:22,373 --> 00:22:23,750
if he's far away,
you feel like dying.

237
00:22:23,941 --> 00:22:26,751
Kalyan means addiction!
Pavan means addiction...

238
00:22:27,278 --> 00:22:29,485
Will he come to pay bill?
You fool!

239
00:22:29,713 --> 00:22:31,624
He's in Spain for film shoot.

240
00:22:31,849 --> 00:22:33,760
Spain?
- Catch them!

241
00:22:35,185 --> 00:22:38,758
Midnight 12.30 am
Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh

242
00:22:50,668 --> 00:22:52,773
Bhai, they're in this lodge.

243
00:22:54,338 --> 00:22:55,442
Suryadev Lodge
Navayug Market, Ghaziabad

244
00:23:08,352 --> 00:23:09,990
Where are the people
who came from Andhra?

245
00:23:10,354 --> 00:23:13,631
Wait a minute
In room No:205!

246
00:23:14,491 --> 00:23:17,301
Catch them...catch them!

247
00:23:52,129 --> 00:23:54,006
Bloody cowards ran away!

248
00:23:55,032 --> 00:23:59,378
They managed to give me a slip...
today they escaped...

249
00:23:59,603 --> 00:24:01,674
but someday I'll catch them.

250
00:24:05,609 --> 00:24:08,055
No, this is Axis bank show!

251
00:24:08,479 --> 00:24:10,720
So many cards are here,
it's confusing, daddy.

252
00:24:10,948 --> 00:24:12,928
If you're so confused
for playing with it,

253
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,595
how confused should I be
for using it?

254
00:24:14,818 --> 00:24:16,525
Why are you then using
so many cards?

255
00:24:16,754 --> 00:24:19,064
I get calls from every bank
to use them,

256
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:25,372
I didn't want to hurt anyone
so I'm using all banks!

257
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:29,036
Someone is here to use you.
Go, meet him.

258
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:35,046
Recovery agents, discovery
channel too mustn't find me.

259
00:24:37,408 --> 00:24:38,614
You didn't expect this entry, right?

260
00:24:38,842 --> 00:24:39,616
Running away like a thief.

261
00:24:39,977 --> 00:24:41,615
Ringing door bell and
attacking from backdoor.

262
00:24:41,845 --> 00:24:42,755
You hurt my feelings.

263
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,426
Then, take him,
slap him tightly.

264
00:24:45,649 --> 00:24:46,627
Try beating me!

265
00:24:47,518 --> 00:24:49,555
New fridge is in store room,
take that also.

266
00:24:49,787 --> 00:24:52,734
I can't bear this life.
- Come, I'll take you also.

267
00:24:55,592 --> 00:24:57,071
Give me your hand.
- My fate!

268
00:24:58,429 --> 00:24:58,634
Skin ripped off.

269
00:24:58,862 --> 00:24:59,966
Be happy for not losing your finger.

270
00:25:00,197 --> 00:25:03,576
It seems Boggu Seenu took poison,
he's in hospital now.

271
00:25:04,802 --> 00:25:06,406
Srinivas, who is dark like coal!

272
00:25:06,603 --> 00:25:07,411
Come!

273
00:25:07,604 --> 00:25:09,743
Why did you do this?

274
00:25:10,541 --> 00:25:11,645
He seems fine!

275
00:25:11,875 --> 00:25:14,446
Why did you try to commit suicide
drinking nail polish?

276
00:25:15,012 --> 00:25:16,116
You?
_ yes!

277
00:25:16,547 --> 00:25:18,584
We don't believe it.
- You must believe.

278
00:25:18,816 --> 00:25:20,921
After making blind,
but God shows way to home,

279
00:25:21,118 --> 00:25:24,065
likewise though I'm dark,
God showed me a fair girl friend.

280
00:25:24,488 --> 00:25:25,796
Tell me clearly that
I can understand.

281
00:25:26,023 --> 00:25:30,438
I went to a coffee shop to collect
installment from a customer.

282
00:25:31,562 --> 00:25:32,939
Who is here?
- What do you want?

283
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:35,440
Is your owner there?
- Want owner or coffee?

284
00:25:36,133 --> 00:25:38,807
One black coffee!
- One black coffee for this black man!

285
00:25:39,036 --> 00:25:41,812
I'll not marry till I find
the man I like, uncle.

286
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:43,484
What are you saying?

287
00:25:43,707 --> 00:25:45,084
In such a big city,

288
00:25:45,509 --> 00:25:46,681
if you want
you'll get pizza and burger,

289
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:48,787
how can you find a man you like?

290
00:25:49,847 --> 00:25:52,691
Uncle! Do you believe in
love at first sight?

291
00:25:52,916 --> 00:25:55,157
I do believe and
I've fallen too.

292
00:25:55,586 --> 00:25:56,462
I too!

293
00:25:58,055 --> 00:25:58,965
Who is he?

294
00:25:59,189 --> 00:26:01,795
Look there, that man!

295
00:26:02,926 --> 00:26:04,030
He?

296
00:26:04,261 --> 00:26:07,470
How could you like him?
He's like burnt decoction.

297
00:26:07,865 --> 00:26:10,971
You're like pure milk.
How can you both make a match?

298
00:26:11,168 --> 00:26:14,479
If we mix, it'll make a
good coffee, right uncle?

299
00:26:15,072 --> 00:26:17,052
Look at his eyes!

300
00:26:18,742 --> 00:26:19,812
Look at his teeth!

301
00:26:20,611 --> 00:26:22,113
Except eyes and teeth,
everything else is dark!

302
00:26:22,513 --> 00:26:23,992
I'm ready to sell tickets
in black for a living,

303
00:26:24,214 --> 00:26:25,852
but I can't tolerate that
dark man calling me uncle.

304
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:27,994
Then, I'll stop calling you
as uncle.

305
00:26:31,755 --> 00:26:33,996
Yes uncle, you're seeing
only his complexion,

306
00:26:34,191 --> 00:26:36,000
I'm seeing his inner beauty.

307
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,664
Inner means...?

308
00:26:41,632 --> 00:26:45,671
Did you call me now?
- You only!

309
00:26:45,969 --> 00:26:47,676
Are you married?
- No.

310
00:26:47,871 --> 00:26:49,544
I'm ready to divorce also.
- I'll kick you!

311
00:26:49,773 --> 00:26:51,844
Did you see, uncle?
This is love.

312
00:26:55,779 --> 00:26:57,759
Do you love me?

313
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:09,762
If sky is a girl,
it'll be like you...

314
00:27:11,995 --> 00:27:19,038
If happiness turns mischief,
it'll be like me...

315
00:27:19,236 --> 00:27:27,178
When you fall down like rain...
I'll be earth to receive it...

316
00:27:27,611 --> 00:27:30,717
Let's unite like rain and earth...

317
00:27:30,948 --> 00:27:32,222
Hey, you sit down!

318
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:35,796
Imagining?
I'm getting irritated,

319
00:27:36,019 --> 00:27:37,589
can't dare see your combination.

320
00:27:37,821 --> 00:27:40,062
You're bearing Tsunamis and
earth quakes,

321
00:27:40,257 --> 00:27:41,930
our combination would
be a sensation, sir.

322
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:43,570
Please accept it, sir.

323
00:27:44,027 --> 00:27:46,268
No need to beg anyone.
Not only he,

324
00:27:46,697 --> 00:27:49,610
even villains like Supreet,
Sudeep, Pradeep Hawat

325
00:27:49,833 --> 00:27:51,073
can't stop our love.

326
00:27:51,268 --> 00:27:53,077
Your damned fate, I can't help it.

327
00:28:02,179 --> 00:28:03,283
Pay our bill too!

328
00:28:03,714 --> 00:28:06,923
Not only this bill,
I'll pay any bill.

329
00:28:07,651 --> 00:28:10,757
Like a Benz car entering slum,
a fair girl entered my life.

330
00:28:10,954 --> 00:28:13,958
I know myself well
so I don't keep mirrors in home,

331
00:28:14,191 --> 00:28:15,261
but from that day...

332
00:28:19,963 --> 00:28:21,965
Combing hair again and again...

333
00:28:22,199 --> 00:28:24,270
Applying powder again and again...

334
00:28:32,976 --> 00:28:35,650
Chatting all night and
shopping all the day!

335
00:28:35,879 --> 00:28:36,789
And about my confidence,

336
00:28:37,014 --> 00:28:38,857
it raised to the level of
replacing Mahesh's photo

337
00:28:39,082 --> 00:28:39,856
with mine in Facebook,

338
00:28:54,331 --> 00:28:55,639
Uncle...

339
00:28:58,902 --> 00:29:01,974
Uncle!
- You wait, I'll use him.

340
00:29:02,906 --> 00:29:05,011
I'm all over your heart,

341
00:29:05,242 --> 00:29:08,815
and you're sending
family messages also to me, right?

342
00:29:09,012 --> 00:29:10,889
That's for you only.

343
00:29:12,115 --> 00:29:15,824
I gave clue to impress uncle
for our benefit.

344
00:29:18,121 --> 00:29:20,829
Uncle loves...home theatre?

345
00:29:24,361 --> 00:29:27,672
Always about your uncle only?
Don't you want anything?

346
00:29:27,864 --> 00:29:31,004
Nail polish is enough for me.

347
00:29:32,135 --> 00:29:35,378
I bought nail polish as wished
by Shruthi in Brigade road,

348
00:29:35,806 --> 00:29:37,683
gift packing it beautifully,

349
00:29:38,942 --> 00:29:41,718
I went to the coffee shop
to give her.

350
00:29:41,945 --> 00:29:42,685
There...

351
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,855
Please uncle!
- He?

352
00:29:45,048 --> 00:29:47,927
He's like a cotton filled lorry!
How could you like him?

353
00:29:48,151 --> 00:29:50,188
Did you see his T-shirt and pant?

354
00:29:50,387 --> 00:29:52,867
It's extra large size!
- Uncle!

355
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:58,199
You see only his fat
but I see the love in his eyes.

356
00:30:02,299 --> 00:30:04,870
You're not married by
any chance, are you?

357
00:30:07,838 --> 00:30:10,944
Not yet, I'm trying!
- No need to try anymore,

358
00:30:11,174 --> 00:30:14,280
from this moment you're
everything to me.

359
00:30:24,321 --> 00:30:26,232
I earn my livelihood by recovery,

360
00:30:26,456 --> 00:30:28,959
but they took atoll on my life
that I could never recover.

361
00:30:29,192 --> 00:30:31,229
They too got cheated like me.

362
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:34,308
Bloody!

363
00:30:35,198 --> 00:30:38,407
Did you ever recharge your
mother's phone for Rs.100?- No way!

364
00:30:38,769 --> 00:30:41,409
Will you buy cell phones and
spend thousands on girls?

365
00:30:42,773 --> 00:30:46,243
Girls don't buy lpads or cell phones
with their father's money,

366
00:30:46,443 --> 00:30:48,252
they use scapegoats like him for it.

367
00:30:48,478 --> 00:30:50,321
Basically girls are three types,

368
00:30:50,781 --> 00:30:51,987
LCD, LED and 3D!

369
00:30:52,215 --> 00:30:56,254
LCD, they use love to cheat
and then delete it,

370
00:30:56,486 --> 00:31:00,263
LED, they use love to enjoy
and then ditch,

371
00:31:00,457 --> 00:31:03,267
now 3D, this is most dangerous,

372
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:06,805
they appear like you got them
but they're very far beyond reach,

373
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:09,806
they show sky and
make you lick earth!

374
00:31:10,033 --> 00:31:11,478
Then, my girl is 3D!

375
00:31:11,902 --> 00:31:14,815
Why do you still call her
as my girl?

376
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:17,018
You must teach them a lesson,
will you commit suicide for them?

377
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,345
He's not that worth,
you must do something.

378
00:31:20,243 --> 00:31:21,017
I'll do.

379
00:31:21,244 --> 00:31:23,121
Shruthi who has lost her rhythm,

380
00:31:24,514 --> 00:31:27,290
I'll teach a lesson to
the man who has gone crazy!

381
00:31:28,585 --> 00:31:30,826
DTBK for both!
- You mean?

382
00:31:31,054 --> 00:31:31,964
Head it, fools!

383
00:31:32,189 --> 00:31:35,466
"Ft for tat

384
00:31:38,862 --> 00:31:41,502
What's this uncle?
Today is very dull.

385
00:31:41,932 --> 00:31:43,502
Don't worry,

386
00:31:43,867 --> 00:31:45,505
Bangalore is not
short of scapegoats.

387
00:31:45,936 --> 00:31:47,472
Someone would come searching us.

388
00:31:47,871 --> 00:31:49,817
Let's break all the old records.

389
00:32:03,286 --> 00:32:06,165
Here com es, my King!

390
00:32:08,024 --> 00:32:09,162
Did you see his get up?

391
00:32:12,896 --> 00:32:15,399
Hello bearer! which is the best place
for me to sit?

392
00:32:15,866 --> 00:32:17,004
Sit there.

393
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:21,847
I think these idiots
don't like cleanliness.

394
00:32:30,313 --> 00:32:31,519
Why isn't anyone coming?

395
00:32:32,115 --> 00:32:34,220
Hello bearer!
- Tell me sir.

396
00:32:34,451 --> 00:32:37,022
Can you get me a hot cup of coffee?
- Okay sir.

397
00:32:38,321 --> 00:32:41,427
Add little sugar,
don't think I've diabetes,

398
00:32:41,658 --> 00:32:43,865
just for prevention!
- Okay. - Go!

399
00:32:44,928 --> 00:32:48,205
What do you feel on seeing him, uncle?

400
00:32:49,933 --> 00:32:51,571
He looks like king of mad men!

401
00:32:52,002 --> 00:32:56,451
Rs.150 for a coffee!
What do they add in it?

402
00:33:00,477 --> 00:33:02,047
What are you waiting for?

403
00:33:03,947 --> 00:33:06,587
What ever you may say,
I'll love and marry, uncle!

404
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:07,928
How is it possible?

405
00:33:08,151 --> 00:33:09,596
You can instant coffee here

406
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,897
but where can you get
instant lover?

407
00:33:12,689 --> 00:33:13,394
<i>L</i> 901 one!

408
00:33:14,691 --> 00:33:15,567
Who is he?

409
00:33:16,693 --> 00:33:17,398
He!

410
00:33:19,262 --> 00:33:20,400
Who? That man?

411
00:33:20,597 --> 00:33:22,907
The man with mid hairline!
- Yes!

412
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:27,081
Look at the way he sips coffee, uncle.

413
00:33:27,938 --> 00:33:29,076
The sound...

414
00:33:30,974 --> 00:33:33,250
the way he places
his cup down...

415
00:33:34,044 --> 00:33:37,150
The way he wipes his mouth!
Oh my God!

416
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:40,418
Damn it! Hot dog face!

417
00:33:40,717 --> 00:33:42,094
Look through my eyes, uncle.

418
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:45,630
At your age even Babu Mohan
would appear like Mahesh Babu!

419
00:33:45,989 --> 00:33:47,491
Hello excuse me!

420
00:33:47,724 --> 00:33:51,103
Are you both discussing about me?
- Yes.

421
00:33:51,328 --> 00:33:52,966
You don't have
any lover, do you?

422
00:33:53,196 --> 00:33:57,440
Oh, no! I haven't yet given
even a flower to any girl!

423
00:33:58,301 --> 00:33:59,974
Then, my line is clear.

424
00:34:00,203 --> 00:34:01,648
I don't like this flower boy!

425
00:34:02,072 --> 00:34:05,110
You're always like this,
you never understand my heart.

426
00:34:05,342 --> 00:34:07,447
Why are you hurting her tender heart?

427
00:34:07,677 --> 00:34:10,317
Shut up! I'll stamp you!

428
00:34:10,547 --> 00:34:11,651
You're responsible for this.
- Am I?

429
00:34:12,015 --> 00:34:13,653
Sir bill.
- Bill? Pay it.

430
00:34:14,084 --> 00:34:15,961
He'll pay, take it.
- Okay sir.

431
00:34:26,663 --> 00:34:28,643
He's coming! Maintain dignity.

432
00:34:31,101 --> 00:34:32,671
I paid the bill.

433
00:34:33,103 --> 00:34:34,480
I gave him Rs.5 as tip
for your sake.

434
00:34:36,706 --> 00:34:38,014
Why are you feeling so shy?

435
00:34:38,241 --> 00:34:40,653
It's irritating to imagine
you both together.

436
00:34:41,444 --> 00:34:43,219
If it's okay to her,
what's your objection man?

437
00:34:43,446 --> 00:34:44,686
What's this sudden variation?

438
00:34:45,115 --> 00:34:47,152
I'm like this,
variations depend on emotions!

439
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:49,227
He's too hungry, let's go!
- Where are you going, Pulka?

440
00:34:49,452 --> 00:34:50,362
Pulka? What's that?

441
00:34:50,587 --> 00:34:52,692
I'll call names according
to face, foolish Pulka!

442
00:34:53,123 --> 00:34:55,501
We'll take leave.
- Where?- To college.

443
00:34:56,192 --> 00:34:58,570
I mean go home, take books
and go to college.

444
00:34:58,795 --> 00:35:01,332
I'll call you today evening,
can you give your number, Shruthi?

445
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,245
I asked her number,
why are you giving your number?

446
00:35:05,468 --> 00:35:06,674
Shruthi, give me your phone.

447
00:35:07,804 --> 00:35:11,342
It's cute and colourful like you.

448
00:35:19,816 --> 00:35:20,590
That's my number!

449
00:35:21,051 --> 00:35:24,191
Ravi, love at first sight!
Feed it like that!- Okay!

450
00:35:29,059 --> 00:35:30,732
First time in my life
I was overtaken.

451
00:35:31,161 --> 00:35:33,072
I'll show my prowess to
that variation boy!

452
00:35:33,296 --> 00:35:36,539
Is it necessary to wake sleeping
horse to get kicked, uncle?

453
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,539
There's no page of compromise
in my crazy diary.

454
00:35:39,736 --> 00:35:42,376
You mean want to get hit again?
- I'll hit back!

455
00:35:43,106 --> 00:35:45,052
Give the phone.
- Your fate!

456
00:35:48,111 --> 00:35:49,715
Have hot omelette...

457
00:35:52,182 --> 00:35:53,388
Heb', 'your phone...

458
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:55,228
Message?

459
00:35:58,655 --> 00:35:59,429
Shruthi?

460
00:35:59,656 --> 00:36:01,636
Hi sweet heart, what are you doing?

461
00:36:02,092 --> 00:36:04,094
Sweet heart? Wow!

462
00:36:04,327 --> 00:36:07,069
I think she's interested,
I'll create interest from here.

463
00:36:08,198 --> 00:36:10,769
I was waiting for your message.
What about you then?

464
00:36:11,201 --> 00:36:12,305
I'm thinking about you only.

465
00:36:12,535 --> 00:36:14,412
I didn't even eat, you know that?

466
00:36:16,339 --> 00:36:19,582
I didn't even take bath!

467
00:36:20,543 --> 00:36:22,580
How can you stay without bath?
You dirty fellow!

468
00:36:22,779 --> 00:36:25,783
Why dear? Water problem?

469
00:36:26,149 --> 00:36:29,596
No...no...heart problem!

470
00:36:30,887 --> 00:36:33,265
You naughty!

471
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:48,605
Stop it...stop it man!

472
00:36:55,145 --> 00:36:56,146
Who is on line, dad?

473
00:36:56,379 --> 00:36:59,451
Some Shruthi!
- Shruthi?

474
00:36:59,816 --> 00:37:02,626
The girl is sending many messages,
who is she?

475
00:37:02,819 --> 00:37:04,799
Not a girl but grandma!

476
00:37:05,188 --> 00:37:07,168
Provident fund is assured,
so she took a loan,

477
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:08,835
repaying is getting late,
so trying to impress me.

478
00:37:09,192 --> 00:37:12,298
Without knowing this
I sent love messages.

479
00:37:12,529 --> 00:37:14,839
Old lady may charge
eve teasing case on me.

480
00:37:15,198 --> 00:37:16,643
Manage it cleverly.

481
00:37:18,201 --> 00:37:21,512
I'm unable to get sleep,
what do you want me to do?

482
00:37:21,738 --> 00:37:23,376
Hey Pulka!

483
00:37:23,606 --> 00:37:25,176
One shot
you're down by a kg!

484
00:37:25,408 --> 00:37:26,819
He got me!

485
00:37:36,186 --> 00:37:38,723
Plan something crazy
before class is over, uncle.

486
00:37:38,955 --> 00:37:41,834
I'm there, right?
- Uncle!

487
00:37:45,195 --> 00:37:48,870
His phone call!
- He?

488
00:37:49,299 --> 00:37:51,336
Shall we avoid or tease him?

489
00:37:51,568 --> 00:37:53,411
Better to get rid of him.
- You say like that.

490
00:37:54,571 --> 00:37:56,414
Why did you pick the call, Pulka?

491
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:57,208
Where's the girl?

492
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,545
She's in temple.
- Temple?

493
00:37:59,776 --> 00:38:02,882
Yes, she made a vow to visit Puttaparthi
on getting a lover like you.

494
00:38:03,313 --> 00:38:04,849
We came to Puttaparthi today morning.

495
00:38:05,782 --> 00:38:08,422
Oh! I'm also in Puttaparthi!
Same vow!

496
00:38:08,651 --> 00:38:10,688
It seems simpleton is
in Puttaparthi!

497
00:38:12,789 --> 00:38:13,699
Tell me.
- What did you say now?

498
00:38:13,923 --> 00:38:14,697
Sorry, tell me sir.

499
00:38:14,891 --> 00:38:17,235
Let's go together,
where are you staying?

500
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,440
How can we go together?
It's impossible.

501
00:38:19,662 --> 00:38:21,767
We're in a traffic jam.
It's too crowded!

502
00:38:21,998 --> 00:38:24,376
Don't push, walk carefully.

503
00:38:24,601 --> 00:38:25,909
Why are you stamping my feet?
Do you've any sense?

504
00:38:26,269 --> 00:38:27,873
I'll beat you with slippers.

505
00:38:28,571 --> 00:38:29,879
Not you sir.

506
00:38:31,241 --> 00:38:32,777
Do one thing sir.
- What's it?

507
00:38:33,243 --> 00:38:34,722
'Visiting together isn't possible,

508
00:38:34,911 --> 00:38:37,790
go alone and walk back
to Bangalore.

509
00:38:38,014 --> 00:38:39,550
She'll be very happy-

510
00:38:41,017 --> 00:38:43,588
What?
- I saw you...

511
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:46,266
How can you see us? Are you mad?

512
00:38:46,489 --> 00:38:47,934
I saw you!
- You can't see me.

513
00:38:48,358 --> 00:38:50,463
Lift your hand once!
- I will not.

514
00:38:50,693 --> 00:38:53,469
Lift your hand and turn sir.

515
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:56,472
Okay, I lifted my hand...
I turned back!

516
00:39:01,938 --> 00:39:04,418
We're caught! Manage him, uncle.

517
00:39:04,974 --> 00:39:08,820
Is this Puttaparthi?
- Just for fun!

518
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:12,486
Shruthi, please come aside.
You come here.

519
00:39:12,715 --> 00:39:14,922
Is it your glasses?
- Yes, mine.

520
00:39:15,718 --> 00:39:17,755
Will you ask me to walk back
to Bangalore?

521
00:39:17,954 --> 00:39:19,831
That too was for fun!

522
00:39:20,056 --> 00:39:21,967
Fun, bloody...
- For my happiness!

523
00:39:22,392 --> 00:39:25,271
I'm there to make you happy, right?

524
00:39:25,728 --> 00:39:26,832
Innocence there and violence here!

525
00:39:27,063 --> 00:39:29,441
Performance depends on person,
you mad Pulka!

526
00:39:29,666 --> 00:39:32,510
If you don't have any objection,
shall we go to watch a film evening?

527
00:39:32,735 --> 00:39:34,772
I've classes till 4 pm!

528
00:39:35,004 --> 00:39:35,846
Show begins at 5 pm!

529
00:39:36,072 --> 00:39:38,985
I'll come with tickets,
you're coming with me, aren't you?

530
00:39:39,409 --> 00:39:40,854
I mean...
- I mean...

531
00:39:41,978 --> 00:39:43,457
You're coming, that's all!

532
00:39:45,415 --> 00:39:46,951
I'll go to class.

533
00:39:50,553 --> 00:39:51,964
Where are you going, Pulka?

534
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:56,796
If she fails to pick my call evening
or if you pick the call,

535
00:39:56,993 --> 00:39:57,994
do you know what would I do?
- I don't know.

536
00:39:58,428 --> 00:40:00,305
For fun,

537
00:40:00,997 --> 00:40:02,670
I'll take out your heart,

538
00:40:02,899 --> 00:40:05,539
I'll mash into pieces,
make a cutlet of it,

539
00:40:05,768 --> 00:40:06,542
and make you eat it!

540
00:40:06,769 --> 00:40:07,975
Will you make me eat it?

541
00:40:08,438 --> 00:40:10,315
Your Hindi is very good.
- Fine. Bye!

542
00:40:13,676 --> 00:40:14,916
To hell with his variations!

543
00:40:20,016 --> 00:40:21,825
He has stuck like bad luck!

544
00:40:22,018 --> 00:40:23,656
How to get rid of him?

545
00:40:25,922 --> 00:40:29,665
I'm tensed, uncle,
are you playing happily here?

546
00:40:32,128 --> 00:40:36,838
He would be going around college
like a dog with tickets.

547
00:40:39,369 --> 00:40:42,680
His phone call, talk to him.
- Uncle!

548
00:40:43,373 --> 00:40:45,011
You don't get afraid,
I'm there, right?

549
00:40:45,475 --> 00:40:48,922
Talk to him. I'll direct, you act,
no need to worry.

550
00:40:51,614 --> 00:40:54,060
I came home after my class
got over at 1 pm.

551
00:40:54,484 --> 00:40:55,724
Please don't get angry.

552
00:40:55,952 --> 00:41:01,061
Epics say it's a sin to get
angry on lover.

553
00:41:01,424 --> 00:41:02,926
You saved me, bye.

554
00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:05,537
Stay there,
I'll come to pick you up.

555
00:41:06,429 --> 00:41:07,032
Will you come to my home?

556
00:41:08,631 --> 00:41:10,736
It's very far away.

557
00:41:10,967 --> 00:41:15,746
In fact at times I stay back with
friend to avoid this traffic.

558
00:41:15,972 --> 00:41:18,543
I'm a lover, I'll make it
to you at any cost.

559
00:41:18,741 --> 00:41:19,412
Tell me your address.

560
00:41:19,642 --> 00:41:22,714
Address?
Address?

561
00:41:25,848 --> 00:41:30,627
Mysore pak...
Mysore road!

562
00:41:30,853 --> 00:41:31,729
Mysore road?

563
00:41:35,858 --> 00:41:37,064
Very far!

564
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,632
Where in Mysore road, Shruthi?

565
00:41:38,861 --> 00:41:45,904
In Mysore road...money...rupee...

566
00:41:47,203 --> 00:41:48,580
In Dollars colony.
- Dollars colony?

567
00:41:49,772 --> 00:41:50,773
Where in Dollars colony?

568
00:41:51,007 --> 00:41:54,580
Where in Dollars colony mean...

569
00:41:54,777 --> 00:41:58,748
Post office street!

570
00:42:00,883 --> 00:42:02,988
Plot No:369, white building, right?

571
00:42:04,454 --> 00:42:06,092
He got the address, uncle.

572
00:42:06,556 --> 00:42:10,595
Waste of using phone,
he may be at our gate. Move aside.

573
00:42:15,231 --> 00:42:20,112
Havel come correctly?

574
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:22,140
Though we gave wrong address,
you came to the right place.

575
00:42:22,572 --> 00:42:23,949
Come here.
- No, you'll beat me.

576
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,141
If you don't come here,
I'll come there.

577
00:42:25,575 --> 00:42:26,144
I'll not come.

578
00:42:26,576 --> 00:42:29,455
You and your dirty Pulka ideas.
Wait, I'm coming.

579
00:42:30,046 --> 00:42:32,617
That too smart guy is coming up!

580
00:42:32,815 --> 00:42:33,953
If we don't do anything now,

581
00:42:34,183 --> 00:42:36,129
he'll take you to film
and beat me.

582
00:42:36,519 --> 00:42:37,691
What should we do, uncle?

583
00:42:51,667 --> 00:42:52,702
Please come.

584
00:42:55,605 --> 00:42:57,482
You're fine, short man!
- Come.

585
00:42:58,508 --> 00:42:59,486
Got it stitched recently.

586
00:43:02,945 --> 00:43:04,720
For giving wrong address
or for opening the door late.

587
00:43:04,947 --> 00:43:06,517
For changing dress
before I came in.

588
00:43:06,749 --> 00:43:10,526
I changed my dress for variety.
For fun!

589
00:43:10,753 --> 00:43:12,198
“My not with just loins?
it would be better.

590
00:43:12,622 --> 00:43:13,657
I'll try it next time.

591
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:16,499
Why are you calling her
as if she's your wife?

592
00:43:41,717 --> 00:43:44,027
What's this half naked dress?
Why not wear something decent?

593
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:45,028
Shameless girl.

594
00:43:45,221 --> 00:43:48,566
Actually Saturday is
washing day for us.

595
00:43:48,791 --> 00:43:52,204
By mistake I put all my clothes
in washing machine.

596
00:43:52,595 --> 00:43:53,699
Yes...yes...

597
00:43:53,896 --> 00:43:56,570
Monday is non-vegetarian day,
Thursday is fasting day,

598
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:59,040
Saturday is washing day!

599
00:43:59,669 --> 00:44:00,773
Cinema tickets will go waste, right?

600
00:44:01,003 --> 00:44:04,883
How can she come to film in a towel?
- She'll com e.

601
00:44:05,942 --> 00:44:06,886
How?

602
00:44:11,614 --> 00:44:13,059
Stand in this position.

603
00:44:13,249 --> 00:44:14,922
Why do you always ask me
to stand in a position?

604
00:44:15,151 --> 00:44:16,061
Shall I tell?

605
00:44:18,821 --> 00:44:22,064
Come inside.
Nothing doing, come inside.

606
00:44:22,291 --> 00:44:23,565
Uncle!

607
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:29,901
He took her inside and shut the door.

608
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:35,740
He won't do anything
with her funnily, right?

609
00:44:35,938 --> 00:44:37,815
What are you doing here?
Get up!

610
00:44:39,375 --> 00:44:40,581
What did you do with her?

611
00:44:40,977 --> 00:44:44,083
You had doubt how can she come?
How can I take her out? See now!

612
00:44:44,313 --> 00:44:45,917
Come dear!

613
00:44:52,855 --> 00:44:54,960
Tell me frankly, how is the frock?

614
00:44:55,191 --> 00:44:57,603
You tore it but you're rocking!

615
00:44:57,793 --> 00:44:59,272
Come, let's go.
- Uncle!

616
00:44:59,862 --> 00:45:02,308
Give me a dress like that,
I'll also come to watch the film.

617
00:45:02,732 --> 00:45:05,941
Wash the clothes, Pulka,
you come with me.

618
00:45:21,684 --> 00:45:28,124
Seeing girls, get tempted,
melt and then get ditched...

619
00:45:28,324 --> 00:45:34,206
Getting hurt and ruining life...
To all the young men!

620
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:39,971
This song is dedicated to them!

621
00:45:56,919 --> 00:46:00,833
Are you sister of Kajal
or Kareena's cousin?

622
00:46:03,459 --> 00:46:07,236
Are you Kathrina Kaif
or sensational beauty?

623
00:46:17,406 --> 00:46:20,717
But if we love
why do you act proud?

624
00:46:20,943 --> 00:46:23,924
We give heart to you,
but you reject...

625
00:46:24,146 --> 00:46:27,923
Why do you need this lousy life?
Go to hell!

626
00:46:32,421 --> 00:46:35,868
Listen to me dear,
we'll ride on you...

627
00:46:39,061 --> 00:46:42,702
God made this pair, O my dear...

628
00:47:22,438 --> 00:47:25,976
You're the fire under
my heart's cooker...

629
00:47:26,208 --> 00:47:29,314
I'm calling you with whistle,
why are you getting irritated?

630
00:47:29,545 --> 00:47:32,458
If you disturb a young man
who is like an anthill...

631
00:47:32,882 --> 00:47:36,329
I'll show you how it would be
and what would happen...

632
00:47:36,552 --> 00:47:40,090
I'll not leave you like
Rajamouli's Fly...

633
00:48:33,542 --> 00:48:36,853
You make fun of our love
and sincerity...

634
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:40,322
You won't enter the water,
but you'll create ripples...

635
00:48:40,516 --> 00:48:43,497
Our heart is the only treasure
we hide safely...

636
00:48:43,886 --> 00:48:47,197
You play a game of marbles
with it...

637
00:48:47,423 --> 00:48:50,836
If you hurt us,
you'll get cursed...

638
00:49:06,542 --> 00:49:08,522
Love?
- No, teasing.

639
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:16,860
Kalligudi
Madurai District

640
00:49:28,464 --> 00:49:31,035
Suri, find when is the next train.

641
00:49:31,333 --> 00:49:34,109
When is the next train?
- In 30 minutes.

642
00:50:12,508 --> 00:50:16,957
Look, how many are there!
If we go, we'll also get caught.

643
00:50:20,049 --> 00:50:25,089
I got you, Suri!
Where are they?

644
00:50:25,387 --> 00:50:29,494
There's no way you can
escape from here.

645
00:50:53,415 --> 00:50:56,328
If I had one man like him with me,

646
00:50:56,552 --> 00:50:59,624
I would've caught them
both long back!

647
00:51:05,995 --> 00:51:06,473
Okay!

648
00:51:08,364 --> 00:51:08,967
Okay, tell me.

649
00:51:11,433 --> 00:51:12,639
I'll come there, right?

650
00:51:15,237 --> 00:51:17,478
Why did you come so late?

651
00:51:17,706 --> 00:51:19,549
You promised to take to watch film

652
00:51:20,009 --> 00:51:22,148
'Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu'.
Get ready quickly.

653
00:51:22,378 --> 00:51:24,483
Get ready.' Take you to film?
Who are you?

654
00:51:24,713 --> 00:51:26,158
Stop teasing me.

655
00:51:26,448 --> 00:51:29,520
How can you your wife,
who am I?- Wife?

656
00:51:29,651 --> 00:51:30,356
Brother-in-law,

657
00:51:31,253 --> 00:51:33,233
sister tells
I'm not coming to the film.

658
00:51:33,455 --> 00:51:36,026
Did you go to watch
any film without me?

659
00:51:36,258 --> 00:51:37,566
What the hell is this?
Wife and sister-in-law!

660
00:51:37,793 --> 00:51:38,567
What's your problem?

661
00:51:39,061 --> 00:51:40,233
Won't you let son-in-law
to take breath?

662
00:51:40,462 --> 00:51:43,238
Son-in-law, I've made your
favourite snack onion pakodi.

663
00:51:43,465 --> 00:51:45,172
You eat, it's heavenly.

664
00:51:45,367 --> 00:51:49,372
You brought the snack but forgot
chutney, you silly woman!

665
00:51:49,605 --> 00:51:55,578
Son-in-law, till recently she used
to say any man looked like me.

666
00:51:56,045 --> 00:52:01,586
But now if she sees any young man
she calls him my son-in-law.

667
00:52:02,051 --> 00:52:02,722
What am I to do?

668
00:52:03,152 --> 00:52:05,029
If I say husband,
it hurts my sentiments.

669
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:07,598
They're conducting last rites.
- Don't hurt anyone.

670
00:52:07,823 --> 00:52:08,267
You keep quite,

671
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:10,060
Is it wrong to
say he's like my son-in-law?

672
00:52:10,292 --> 00:52:12,363
You eat, son-in-law.
- Stop your nonsense!

673
00:52:15,731 --> 00:52:17,039
Kinsman!

674
00:52:19,301 --> 00:52:22,976
Who are these people?
- Family!

675
00:52:23,172 --> 00:52:23,707
Did you see?

676
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:26,217
When you come home,
a loving wife welcomes you,

677
00:52:26,408 --> 00:52:27,409
a mischievous sister-in-law,

678
00:52:27,643 --> 00:52:29,623
parents-in-law who shower
love on you,

679
00:52:29,845 --> 00:52:31,051
how nice it is!

680
00:52:31,313 --> 00:52:34,226
Aren't you feeling for
missing all this?

681
00:52:34,450 --> 00:52:36,555
I got it...got it!

682
00:52:36,785 --> 00:52:39,288
My wife, turn this side.
- Go, dear.

683
00:52:39,521 --> 00:52:41,432
You won't water holy Basil plant
in home,

684
00:52:41,657 --> 00:52:42,727
but you want to watch film!

685
00:52:43,092 --> 00:52:46,073
No, it's multi star...
- I'll beat...

686
00:52:46,261 --> 00:52:47,399
Single star here!

687
00:52:49,098 --> 00:52:51,442
Won't you watch films with anyone
else other than brother-in-law?

688
00:52:51,667 --> 00:52:53,578
Next time, let's go together
leaving your sister at home.

689
00:52:53,769 --> 00:52:54,645
Dirty Picture, come!

690
00:52:55,104 --> 00:52:57,106
Son-in-law! She's very young girl.

691
00:52:57,339 --> 00:52:58,750
Why are you talking to her like that?

692
00:53:00,109 --> 00:53:01,713
Bloody pakodi performance!

693
00:53:02,144 --> 00:53:03,088
You came here last Dussera,

694
00:53:03,278 --> 00:53:05,781
are you planning to wipe me out
staying here permanently?

695
00:53:06,215 --> 00:53:08,092
Calm down, son-in-law,
why are you getting excited?

696
00:53:08,350 --> 00:53:09,328
You come here.

697
00:53:10,452 --> 00:53:12,762
Either husband or son-in-law!

698
00:53:13,155 --> 00:53:14,133
Don't you know any
other relationship?

699
00:53:14,356 --> 00:53:17,098
Why are you scolding mother-in-aw?

700
00:53:19,128 --> 00:53:20,607
We can't tolerate it anymore.

701
00:53:20,796 --> 00:53:23,606
His violence is upstaging
his performance.

702
00:53:23,832 --> 00:53:26,779
Mother and daughters!
Come, let's go.

703
00:53:27,236 --> 00:53:29,443
Do I've to tell you specially? Go!

704
00:53:32,574 --> 00:53:35,350
What's this you've done?
- Family has such scenes too. Got it?

705
00:53:35,577 --> 00:53:37,614
Won't you ever marry?

706
00:53:37,846 --> 00:53:39,291
I said I'll marry
if I find my kinda girl.

707
00:53:39,481 --> 00:53:40,687
When will you do that?

708
00:53:40,916 --> 00:53:44,363
I begged you, threatened you,
made plea, played dram as!

709
00:53:44,586 --> 00:53:46,623
What else can I do?
When will you marry.'

710
00:53:46,822 --> 00:53:48,165
Will you marry after I die?
- Why do you say like that?

711
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:53,135
I'm giving you a week's time,
come with the girl you like,

712
00:53:53,495 --> 00:53:55,634
if not you must marry
the girl I select.

713
00:53:56,165 --> 00:53:57,303
If that doesn't happen,

714
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,813
I won't be there to respond
to your call.

715
00:54:11,613 --> 00:54:14,184
Wait! Is it Brigade road
to roam around?

716
00:54:14,416 --> 00:54:17,329
He's torturing us more
than HRa]amouli's Fly!

717
00:54:17,553 --> 00:54:19,829
Correct, uncle!
We must do something. No time.

718
00:54:20,222 --> 00:54:22,202
I've an idea even if we
don't have time.

719
00:54:22,424 --> 00:54:25,667
If I tell that idea,
he'll see stars in day light!

720
00:54:25,894 --> 00:54:26,668
What's the idea, uncle?

721
00:54:26,895 --> 00:54:29,341
Tell you'll marry him.
- Have you gone mad?

722
00:54:29,565 --> 00:54:30,873
He too would tell the
same dialogue.

723
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:33,541
Boys now jump with joy at the
mention of girl friend's name.

724
00:54:33,769 --> 00:54:35,214
But say marriage, they'll vanish!

725
00:54:35,437 --> 00:54:36,848
This is Facebook generation!

726
00:54:37,239 --> 00:54:40,345
Not one that faces problems!
- Fantastic, uncle!

727
00:54:40,576 --> 00:54:42,351
You're jobless Steve Jobs, uncle!

728
00:54:42,544 --> 00:54:44,217
Who is he?
I don't care who ever it may be!

729
00:54:44,446 --> 00:54:45,891
Since you compared him with me,
he must be a great man!

730
00:54:46,315 --> 00:54:48,522
Call and give him rude jolt!

731
00:54:50,452 --> 00:54:52,432
Uncle, he's calling!

732
00:54:52,654 --> 00:54:55,533
His bad time has started,
you talk to him.

733
00:54:57,793 --> 00:55:00,239
I was thinking about you,
you called me.

734
00:55:00,462 --> 00:55:02,203
I want to talk to you urgently.

735
00:55:02,397 --> 00:55:04,240
Is it very urgent?
- Very urgent.

736
00:55:04,466 --> 00:55:05,536
Then, open the door.

737
00:55:06,335 --> 00:55:07,439
Uncle!
- What?

738
00:55:07,669 --> 00:55:09,205
He wants me to open the door.

739
00:55:09,404 --> 00:55:11,441
He's here...
he would've come long back.

740
00:55:11,673 --> 00:55:12,378
Open the door.

741
00:55:12,608 --> 00:55:15,452
Uncle!
- Go, open the door.

742
00:55:15,677 --> 00:55:17,213
Go, I'm there, right?

743
00:55:19,248 --> 00:55:21,728
What's so urgent?
Are you missing me?

744
00:55:26,488 --> 00:55:28,729
Where is he?
- I'm here.

745
00:55:28,957 --> 00:55:30,265
Why did you drop in suddenly?

746
00:55:30,492 --> 00:55:32,233
I want to tell you something.
- What's it?

747
00:55:32,427 --> 00:55:34,737
Shall we marry, Shruthi?

748
00:55:40,369 --> 00:55:42,280
Why are you shocked, Shruthi?

749
00:55:42,504 --> 00:55:46,748
Nothing, I need sometime.
- Take as much time as you need.

750
00:55:46,942 --> 00:55:48,285
Take Steve Jobs' time also.

751
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:51,821
Take as much time as you want
but you must say yes.

752
00:55:52,047 --> 00:55:53,924
If she says no.
- I'll kill!

753
00:55:54,516 --> 00:55:55,426
Bye.

754
00:55:59,721 --> 00:56:03,259
What?- One minute.
- One minute.- Go. What?

755
00:56:03,659 --> 00:56:04,433
What did I do now?

756
00:56:04,626 --> 00:56:05,969
You'll give some nasty idea
after I go, right?

757
00:56:06,395 --> 00:56:08,432
That's why I gave it in advance.
Keep it.

758
00:56:09,865 --> 00:56:11,276
Okay, if its advance.

759
00:56:12,634 --> 00:56:15,843
How could he tell what was
in our mind so correctly?

760
00:56:16,872 --> 00:56:17,509
He's back again.

761
00:56:17,739 --> 00:56:19,309
You don't worry,
I'll take care of him.

762
00:56:19,541 --> 00:56:21,282
Why are you torturing us?

763
00:56:21,643 --> 00:56:23,452
Torture?
Who is torturing you?

764
00:56:23,679 --> 00:56:25,955
Torture...
- Nobody is here, father.

765
00:56:26,315 --> 00:56:29,455
Laundry man was ringing the
door bell unnecessarily.

766
00:56:30,552 --> 00:56:34,329
You're not doing anything crazy
in my absence, right?

767
00:56:34,556 --> 00:56:36,331
Can I get that chance, brother-in-law?

768
00:56:36,558 --> 00:56:39,801
Why did you come two days
earlier than promised date?

769
00:56:39,995 --> 00:56:41,338
That is...
- I told him, brother.

770
00:56:41,563 --> 00:56:42,803
But he didn't listen.

771
00:56:42,998 --> 00:56:46,810
Can we still go shopping with
Shruthi's marriage just 10 days away?

772
00:56:47,035 --> 00:56:51,347
You took me around the country
for clothes and jewellery.

773
00:56:51,573 --> 00:56:53,678
Isn't it enough?
- It's marriage, right?

774
00:56:53,909 --> 00:56:55,479
<i>Take rm.</i>

775
00:56:55,911 --> 00:56:58,653
You too go.
- You too take rest.

776
00:56:59,114 --> 00:57:00,320
Uncle!

777
00:57:01,116 --> 00:57:01,821
<i>Wham?</i>

778
00:57:02,017 --> 00:57:03,360
You said I'll not have
freedom after marriage.

779
00:57:03,585 --> 00:57:05,565
And suggested to do something
crazy and enjoy these 10 days.

780
00:57:05,787 --> 00:57:07,027
I liked the concept and
committed myself.

781
00:57:07,456 --> 00:57:09,493
Now, I'm stuck with him.

782
00:57:09,691 --> 00:57:13,696
That's the kick in craziness.
There's risk if it reverses.

783
00:57:13,929 --> 00:57:15,499
We must put an end to it.

784
00:57:15,697 --> 00:57:17,574
May I suggest an idea?
-No!

785
00:57:17,799 --> 00:57:21,372
Keep your ideas...
- No need to tell, I got it.

786
00:57:21,603 --> 00:57:24,846
What should I do now?
- Uncle, find his house.

787
00:57:25,607 --> 00:57:27,348
Now, I'll give him my touch!

788
00:57:29,745 --> 00:57:31,019
Is Ravi in home, uncle?

789
00:57:31,947 --> 00:57:32,857
Who are you?

790
00:57:33,048 --> 00:57:35,528
She's your daughter-in-law
and I'm like your brother.

791
00:57:35,751 --> 00:57:37,025
My name is Shruthi.

792
00:57:37,419 --> 00:57:38,864
Shruthi? He said 60 plus!

793
00:57:39,054 --> 00:57:41,591
He's mad and you're blind.

794
00:57:41,823 --> 00:57:45,396
She's a young maiden,
is she 60 plus for you?

795
00:57:45,627 --> 00:57:46,867
Did he tell you like that, uncle?

796
00:57:47,062 --> 00:57:48,541
Yes.
- What about our love then?

797
00:57:48,764 --> 00:57:50,402
I'm sure he wouldn't have told him.
- Love?

798
00:57:50,632 --> 00:57:51,940
Why do you get shocked for this?

799
00:57:52,167 --> 00:57:54,147
Suddenly he came yesterday and
asked her to marry him,

800
00:57:54,569 --> 00:57:56,412
she too agreed.
- Marriage?- Marriage!

801
00:57:56,638 --> 00:57:59,084
He committed himself to marry
without taking dowry.

802
00:57:59,508 --> 00:58:02,546
My son?
- Yes, uncle. Ravi himself!

803
00:58:02,744 --> 00:58:04,951
Won't you accept?
Will you go on hunger strike?

804
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:05,954
Will you on walkathons?

805
00:58:06,515 --> 00:58:08,085
Will you break his legs?
Tell me!

806
00:58:08,517 --> 00:58:11,726
Lord Venkateshwara! I'm coming!

807
00:58:17,659 --> 00:58:20,401
He'll tell his wife,
that's the first twist.

808
00:58:20,595 --> 00:58:21,767
She'll get heart attack in shock.

809
00:58:21,997 --> 00:58:23,408
That's interval!

810
00:58:23,598 --> 00:58:26,579
After that Ravi will come,
he'll kill him and commit suicide.

811
00:58:26,768 --> 00:58:28,076
This is climax!

812
00:58:33,442 --> 00:58:37,083
All of you come here!

813
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:46,460
When my son said about connection,
I derided him,

814
00:58:47,689 --> 00:58:49,464
he has brought home
Goddess Mahalakshmi herself.

815
00:58:49,691 --> 00:58:51,102
Come, my dear!

816
00:58:53,895 --> 00:58:57,104
If son is chameleon,
father is python!

817
00:58:58,133 --> 00:58:58,668
What's this crowd?

818
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:01,107
Your father would've arranged
a mass bride seeing ceremony.

819
00:59:07,476 --> 00:59:08,113
Why are they here?

820
00:59:09,244 --> 00:59:12,691
I didn't expect result would be
like this for provoking you.

821
00:59:13,815 --> 00:59:16,125
It seems your matter has
reached up to marriage.

822
00:59:17,819 --> 00:59:20,959
It seems you went to her home
and asked to marry you.

823
00:59:21,189 --> 00:59:23,169
Did you ask her or not?

824
00:59:23,592 --> 00:59:26,163
I did.
- That's it! At last my responsibility is over!

825
00:59:26,595 --> 00:59:28,472
If her father comes to know,
you'll get a coating!

826
00:59:28,663 --> 00:59:29,698
You don't know about
my brother-in-law.

827
00:59:29,931 --> 00:59:31,968
He's not just a business man
but Gabbar Singh too!

828
00:59:32,167 --> 00:59:33,168
He's craziest of crazy!

829
00:59:33,602 --> 00:59:34,171
You're too much,

830
00:59:34,603 --> 00:59:36,708
how can they
marry without his permission?

831
00:59:37,072 --> 00:59:41,487
I'll come to your home
to discuss about marriage.- Uncle!

832
00:59:42,177 --> 00:59:44,487
I went overboard in confusion.

833
00:59:45,614 --> 00:59:46,490
I'll go now.

834
00:59:46,681 --> 00:59:49,662
Not uncle, call me as father-in-law!

835
00:59:50,185 --> 00:59:51,493
If you stay here for some more time,

836
00:59:51,686 --> 00:59:52,664
he may ask you to live with him.

837
00:59:52,954 --> 00:59:54,661
We'll take leave now.
- Okay!

838
00:59:54,856 --> 00:59:56,995
Consider this as your own home,
do drop in often.

839
00:59:57,192 --> 00:59:58,830
No way she'll com e.

840
01:00:00,562 --> 01:00:01,734
I got trapped getting
into it for you.

841
01:00:01,963 --> 01:00:03,499
What's this?

842
01:00:04,566 --> 01:00:06,011
You're responsible for this!
- Am I?

843
01:00:06,234 --> 01:00:08,544
Yes, you got me into this
saying crazy,

844
01:00:08,770 --> 01:00:10,750
now my life has gone crazy!

845
01:00:10,972 --> 01:00:13,748
He's not listening to me, he thinks
she's his daughter-in-law.

846
01:00:13,975 --> 01:00:16,751
If his father comes here,
we'll get into trouble, uncle.

847
01:00:16,978 --> 01:00:17,752
Fate!

848
01:00:17,979 --> 01:00:20,687
We must get rid of him at any cost.

849
01:00:21,716 --> 01:00:23,855
No use, I'll open up!

850
01:00:24,653 --> 01:00:27,190
Opening up is correct
Tell him it was just a game.

851
01:00:32,327 --> 01:00:33,203
It's engaged!

852
01:00:36,665 --> 01:00:39,043
No, I'll send him a message.

853
01:00:40,735 --> 01:00:43,215
I want to talk to you,
straight and serious.

854
01:00:47,809 --> 01:00:49,254
I too wanted to tell the same thing.

855
01:00:49,678 --> 01:00:51,055
Let's meet in pub tomorrow.

856
01:00:58,253 --> 01:01:00,597
I'm here for 30 minutes,
I'm waiting for you to say.

857
01:01:00,822 --> 01:01:01,596
Tell me what's the matter?

858
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:04,235
If I give him a chance,
he'll get me into trouble again.

859
01:01:10,699 --> 01:01:13,077
Come, let's sit there.
- Okay, com e.

860
01:01:15,837 --> 01:01:17,817
Order beer!

861
01:01:18,039 --> 01:01:24,615
Hey recovery! What are you doing here?
With girl friend!

862
01:01:24,846 --> 01:01:26,587
I got you!
I'll take you to task.

863
01:01:36,291 --> 01:01:40,637
Bloody! The man who bashed us
in Lakshmi Rai matter.

864
01:01:40,862 --> 01:01:44,309
He's in pub.
A beautiful girl is with him.

865
01:01:44,733 --> 01:01:47,646
Her beauty is giving me fever.

866
01:01:47,869 --> 01:01:51,112
I'm coming there.

867
01:01:51,339 --> 01:01:52,317
I'm giving you a
bumper offer till then.

868
01:01:52,741 --> 01:01:55,984
What?
- He beat us for teasing Lakshmi Rai.

869
01:01:56,211 --> 01:01:58,191
You tease his girl friend today.

870
01:01:58,413 --> 01:02:00,620
I'll pay Rs.5 lakhs to anyone
who touches her.

871
01:02:00,815 --> 01:02:02,795
Rs.10 lakhs to one who kisses her.

872
01:02:02,984 --> 01:02:05,863
If anyone has her?
- Rs.25 lakhs!

873
01:02:06,087 --> 01:02:06,997
25 lakhs!

874
01:02:07,222 --> 01:02:10,999
Your offer is tempting and
the girl is more tempting.

875
01:02:11,226 --> 01:02:12,796
Deal is okay!

876
01:02:12,994 --> 01:02:15,668
If you drink too much,
you'll lose clarity of thought.

877
01:02:15,897 --> 01:02:17,638
No use, I'll tell you myself.

878
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:21,137
I'll use ladies room
and then tell you.

879
01:02:38,019 --> 01:02:39,896
I don't have any opinion on you.

880
01:02:40,121 --> 01:02:42,658
Tell him you did everything for fun!

881
01:02:43,792 --> 01:02:47,239
You made many a men scapegoats,
are you weakening before him?

882
01:02:49,130 --> 01:02:50,336
By any chance
have you fallen for him?

883
01:02:53,268 --> 01:02:56,010
I'll tell him!
- I'll touch you!

884
01:02:57,272 --> 01:02:59,684
Who are you?
Why did you enter ladies room?

885
01:02:59,874 --> 01:03:02,855
Don't get anxious,
I'm Chinnappa Gowda!

886
01:03:03,378 --> 01:03:06,052
Saying get out to such a big man!

887
01:03:06,281 --> 01:03:09,353
Girl, I'll get Rs.5 lakhs
for touching you.

888
01:03:09,751 --> 01:03:11,731
Rs.10 lakhs for kissing you.

889
01:03:11,953 --> 01:03:14,058
Rs.25 lakhs for having you!

890
01:03:14,289 --> 01:03:17,270
If you cooperate with me,
let's share it 50-50!

891
01:03:32,173 --> 01:03:33,379
May be she's not his girl friend.

892
01:03:39,748 --> 01:03:40,385
His girl only!

893
01:03:42,450 --> 01:03:45,761
Hey black and white,
it was Lakshmi Rai then, now she,

894
01:03:45,987 --> 01:03:47,432
can't you sit tight
on seeing beautiful girls?

895
01:03:47,856 --> 01:03:49,733
We can't.
Everyone has a weakness.

896
01:03:49,924 --> 01:03:50,959
We've great offers.

897
01:03:51,192 --> 01:03:53,763
Is it? Then, I'll offer you
holiday package.- What's that?

898
01:03:53,995 --> 01:03:56,976
The first man who touches her,
he can take her on a holiday!

899
01:03:57,532 --> 01:03:59,773
You're super!
I'll be in touch with her.

900
01:04:00,001 --> 01:04:02,743
You be in touch with him.
- Is it? Come on boys!

901
01:04:19,454 --> 01:04:22,094
Oh no, blood!
Why is everyone out of focus?

902
01:04:22,824 --> 01:04:23,768
Get down!

903
01:04:23,958 --> 01:04:24,936
Here...com e.

904
01:04:29,030 --> 01:04:30,771
Sitting on me here also, go away!

905
01:04:36,905 --> 01:04:38,441
Come, touch me!
- I'll not come.

906
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:40,778
What are you looking at?
Go away!

907
01:04:51,052 --> 01:04:52,292
What Gowda?
- What?

908
01:04:52,487 --> 01:04:54,797
Fallen down so quickly!
Get up!

909
01:05:45,306 --> 01:05:52,019
Rohit, we couldn't use
your bumper offer.

910
01:05:52,247 --> 01:05:55,023
There's a Tsunami inside!

911
01:05:55,216 --> 01:05:58,527
Who was the first to try her?
- Me!

912
01:06:00,989 --> 01:06:02,866
She's my future wife!

913
01:06:03,324 --> 01:06:07,204
Forget about touching her,
even if you see her, I'll kill you.

914
01:06:15,336 --> 01:06:17,043
I called this meeting
to tell you something,

915
01:06:17,472 --> 01:06:21,386
girls can be mischievous
but shouldn't be cheap!

916
01:06:21,576 --> 01:06:24,113
There are men who may give life
trusting your love as sincere.

917
01:06:24,345 --> 01:06:26,586
They may kill themselves
if they come to know it's fake.

918
01:06:27,015 --> 01:06:29,552
To make you understand this,
I played a drama with you.

919
01:06:30,351 --> 01:06:32,558
Never play with human emotions!

920
01:06:33,488 --> 01:06:35,126
At least now get to know
the value of love.

921
01:06:35,356 --> 01:06:39,065
Once it's born, even if we die,
it remains for eternity.

922
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:40,398
There's no death for love.

923
01:07:00,715 --> 01:07:02,490
At least now get to know
the value of love.

924
01:07:02,717 --> 01:07:06,426
Once it's born, even if we die,
it remains for eternity.

925
01:07:06,621 --> 01:07:07,929
There's no death for love.

926
01:07:35,650 --> 01:07:42,295
I fell like this...
I fell for you like this...

927
01:07:43,758 --> 01:07:50,141
I turned bad...
I turned bad seeing you...

928
01:07:50,331 --> 01:07:54,973
Have you fallen in to
this intoxication?

929
01:07:55,169 --> 01:07:59,015
Though it's bad for parents,
may I come with you?

930
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:03,154
Even if others warn me,
would I stop myself?

931
01:08:03,344 --> 01:08:10,990
The more years I spend with you
the more happy l am...

932
01:08:55,296 --> 01:09:03,215
In every beat of my heart...
Behind every beat...

933
01:09:03,404 --> 01:09:07,546
I didn't know this earlier...

934
01:09:07,742 --> 01:09:15,627
You came and opened the secret...

935
01:09:15,850 --> 01:09:23,564
Slowly I learnt the technique to
differentiate dream and reality...

936
01:09:23,791 --> 01:09:29,104
Okay, is it my greatness?
It's power of youth...

937
01:09:29,330 --> 01:09:32,573
It happens to everyone...

938
01:10:03,231 --> 01:10:05,609
What are you saying?
- Yes, brother.

939
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:08,610
It seems Rohit saw your son
with a girl.

940
01:10:08,836 --> 01:10:10,110
He's very upset.

941
01:10:10,304 --> 01:10:13,285
I told him it's common now a days!

942
01:10:13,474 --> 01:10:17,479
May be he has mistaken
someone else for her.

943
01:10:17,712 --> 01:10:18,782
Someone is here for you, sir.

944
01:10:21,382 --> 01:10:23,157
Tell him to come later.
- I told him, sir.

945
01:10:23,384 --> 01:10:26,228
But he insists it's very important.
- Call him in.

946
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:35,701
Greetings sir.
- Greetings.

947
01:10:35,930 --> 01:10:37,170
Am I disturbing any function here?

948
01:10:37,398 --> 01:10:39,810
Can I come back another day?

949
01:10:41,169 --> 01:10:42,170
You said it's very important matter.

950
01:10:42,403 --> 01:10:45,145
I'm Mohan Rao!
I stay in Ashok Nagar.

951
01:10:47,275 --> 01:10:49,152
My son works with ICICI...

952
01:10:51,512 --> 01:10:52,388
Why are you telling me this?

953
01:10:52,613 --> 01:10:55,651
My son and your daughter
love each other.

954
01:10:57,618 --> 01:10:59,325
I'm here to talk about that.

955
01:11:01,956 --> 01:11:04,197
Is my daughter in love
with your son?

956
01:11:04,425 --> 01:11:07,668
What's this, brother?
- I'm talking to him, right?

957
01:11:08,229 --> 01:11:12,507
I didn't know till your daughter
came to my home and told me.

958
01:11:27,882 --> 01:11:29,361
Do you know him?

959
01:11:31,452 --> 01:11:32,522
I know him, father.

960
01:11:34,555 --> 01:11:38,867
Do you love his son?

961
01:11:46,934 --> 01:11:49,710
If she tells the truth,
he would die in shock.

962
01:11:49,937 --> 01:11:51,883
Answer, do you love him?

963
01:11:54,342 --> 01:11:55,548
I love him, father.

964
01:12:00,348 --> 01:12:03,886
Have you forgotten you're engaged
and marriage is just a week away?

965
01:12:05,486 --> 01:12:07,898
Ravi made me forget all that, father.

966
01:12:08,489 --> 01:12:12,801
I was ready to marry anyone
for your happiness.

967
01:12:13,261 --> 01:12:17,232
But I've understood that
I'll be happy if I marry Ravi.

968
01:12:17,932 --> 01:12:20,811
But still I'll do whatever
you decide, father.

969
01:12:24,505 --> 01:12:25,575
Go!

970
01:12:29,377 --> 01:12:29,912
What would you say now?

971
01:12:30,311 --> 01:12:32,416
You still claim your daughter
is innocent!- You keep quiet.

972
01:12:32,647 --> 01:12:34,627
Please forgive me. It was my mistake.

973
01:12:34,849 --> 01:12:36,920
No girl's father must face
this situation.

974
01:12:37,985 --> 01:12:40,966
I entered at wrong time and
made a wrong request

975
01:12:41,389 --> 01:12:44,495
But one thing,
I don't want a daughter-in-law,

976
01:12:44,725 --> 01:12:45,601
I want a daughter!

977
01:12:45,993 --> 01:12:47,836
I'll look after your daughter
as my daughter.

978
01:12:49,730 --> 01:12:50,936
If you refuse,

979
01:12:51,332 --> 01:12:52,310
my son will not
come here to trouble you.

980
01:12:52,533 --> 01:12:54,274
He won't take the bride
from her marriage.

981
01:12:54,468 --> 01:12:57,449
I promise.
Decision is yours.

982
01:13:03,477 --> 01:13:04,956
You're soft,

983
01:13:05,346 --> 01:13:07,292
that's why your
daughter has jumped the fence.

984
01:13:07,682 --> 01:13:08,660
Let bygones be bygones,

985
01:13:08,883 --> 01:13:09,953
from the moment they were engaged,

986
01:13:10,351 --> 01:13:12,331
your daughter has become
my daughter-in-law,

987
01:13:12,553 --> 01:13:13,657
let the marriage get over,

988
01:13:13,888 --> 01:13:16,869
I know how to keep her under control.

989
01:13:17,325 --> 01:13:18,531
I'll break her legs and
restrict her to home.

990
01:13:18,759 --> 01:13:19,999
You stop.
- Why should I?

991
01:13:20,428 --> 01:13:23,466
She's talking too much.
- Don't get angry.

992
01:13:24,699 --> 01:13:28,306
Forget whatever has happened!

993
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:33,318
I must forget.

994
01:13:36,777 --> 01:13:37,983
This marriage will not happen.

995
01:13:40,548 --> 01:13:41,458
Why?

996
01:13:44,385 --> 01:13:46,831
I know where my daughter
would be happy!

997
01:13:47,788 --> 01:13:50,667
Look at the difference
what you said and what he said!

998
01:13:51,926 --> 01:13:54,702
He said he wants a daughter
not daughter-in-law!

999
01:13:54,929 --> 01:13:57,569
And you say you'll take her
home as daughter-in-law,

1000
01:13:57,798 --> 01:14:00,005
break her legs to
live as your son's wife.- No...

1001
01:14:12,380 --> 01:14:15,918
lf that old man says cancel,
will you come back silently?

1002
01:14:16,150 --> 01:14:16,855
Can't you hold him by his collar?

1003
01:14:17,051 --> 01:14:19,031
Leave him.
- Why should I?

1004
01:14:19,420 --> 01:14:21,058
There's no girl in Bangalore
who dares refuse me.

1005
01:14:21,489 --> 01:14:23,935
How dare she refuses me
after engagement!

1006
01:14:24,158 --> 01:14:25,535
Can't you do anything?
- No son...

1007
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:28,036
Your father knows only to shake head.

1008
01:14:28,429 --> 01:14:30,534
My brother knows to roll down heads.

1009
01:14:30,765 --> 01:14:32,711
My brother is perfect for this.

1010
01:14:39,407 --> 01:14:44,083
Brother, please don't kill me...

1011
01:14:44,512 --> 01:14:45,889
Where is he?

1012
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:48,082
I don't know where Shankar is!

1013
01:14:48,516 --> 01:14:51,053
Please don't kill me, brother!

1014
01:14:55,523 --> 01:14:56,399
Tell me!

1015
01:15:40,134 --> 01:15:42,136
Brother!

1016
01:15:42,570 --> 01:15:45,676
If he has to marry her,
her love must die!

1017
01:15:45,906 --> 01:15:49,820
Killing love is impossible.
Let's kill her lover!

1018
01:15:50,044 --> 01:15:51,614
They're getting engaged
in a temple.

1019
01:15:51,812 --> 01:15:57,125
Nephew, I'm ready to kill hundreds
to get you married to her.

1020
01:16:11,665 --> 01:16:12,973
Com e, my dear son.

1021
01:16:13,167 --> 01:16:14,646
What's this dress?
Why did you bring me to temple?

1022
01:16:14,869 --> 01:16:16,405
Surprize! You'll know it.

1023
01:16:25,212 --> 01:16:25,656
Tell me.

1024
01:16:25,846 --> 01:16:28,656
We're near Shankar and Nanaii's
farm house in Goa!

1025
01:16:28,849 --> 01:16:30,726
We'll not miss them this time,
we'll kill him, brother.

1026
01:16:30,951 --> 01:16:33,727
Call me after pointing
the gun on his chest!

1027
01:16:33,954 --> 01:16:34,989
Okay, brother.

1028
01:16:35,222 --> 01:16:37,668
Come, good things must be done
at auspicious time.

1029
01:16:37,892 --> 01:16:39,667
Please decorate this to God.

1030
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:42,201
Why are they here?
- That's the surprizze for you.

1031
01:16:42,630 --> 01:16:44,075
Have you arranged marriage?

1032
01:16:44,298 --> 01:16:47,006
Am I that bad?
Only engagement!

1033
01:16:47,201 --> 01:16:48,509
Discounts in bad too!

1034
01:16:48,702 --> 01:16:50,739
Bad? Don't you love each other?

1035
01:16:50,971 --> 01:16:51,745
Won't you marry or not?

1036
01:16:51,972 --> 01:16:53,007
Father, you don't know the truth.

1037
01:16:53,207 --> 01:16:55,084
I know everything, they told me.

1038
01:16:55,543 --> 01:16:58,023
The girl loves you sincerely.

1039
01:16:58,212 --> 01:16:59,850
She cancelled her marriage for you.

1040
01:17:01,315 --> 01:17:02,760
Cancelled her marriage?

1041
01:17:14,595 --> 01:17:15,300
Got them?

1042
01:17:15,663 --> 01:17:18,234
Brother, we got cheated!
- Cheated?

1043
01:17:18,666 --> 01:17:20,577
It wasn't Shankar and Nanaii,

1044
01:17:20,801 --> 01:17:22,041
who made us run around like fools,

1045
01:17:22,236 --> 01:17:24,238
their henchmen!
- What are you saying?

1046
01:17:24,672 --> 01:17:25,776
Yes, brother!
They're just dummies!

1047
01:17:26,006 --> 01:17:27,212
They made us believe it's them!

1048
01:17:29,343 --> 01:17:31,220
Sir, auspicious time is elapsing.

1049
01:17:32,246 --> 01:17:34,123
If you refuse this marriage,
it's promise on me.- Not that..

1050
01:17:34,348 --> 01:17:37,056
Greetings...greetings.

1051
01:17:37,251 --> 01:17:40,232
My son Ravi, your future father-in-law!
Shake hands.

1052
01:17:40,688 --> 01:17:43,134
It's time for engagement.
- Please com e...com e...

1053
01:17:43,357 --> 01:17:45,234
One minute...one minute.

1054
01:17:45,626 --> 01:17:47,128
You carry on, just a minute,
he's too shy.

1055
01:17:47,361 --> 01:17:49,739
You go, I'll join you.
What's it now?

1056
01:17:49,930 --> 01:17:53,605
You can't find a girl like
in the world.

1057
01:17:53,834 --> 01:17:56,144
I saw love for you in her eyes.
- Tell him.

1058
01:17:56,370 --> 01:17:57,610
Please listen to him .

1059
01:17:57,838 --> 01:17:59,249
You too!
- Not...

1060
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:13,824
Getting late, son.

1061
01:18:14,054 --> 01:18:16,295
I'll do as you say but
first l need to talk to you.

1062
01:18:16,724 --> 01:18:17,930
Com e, I want to talk to you.

1063
01:18:23,631 --> 01:18:23,836
Come.
- Getting late, son.

1064
01:18:24,064 --> 01:18:25,634
Go in and see.
- Why should I see?

1065
01:18:25,866 --> 01:18:27,277
I'm telling you, please go.

1066
01:18:38,746 --> 01:18:40,953
Stop it!
- What's this?

1067
01:18:41,982 --> 01:18:45,862
Call anyone!
Tell them Vizag Poorna is here!

1068
01:18:46,086 --> 01:18:47,793
Nobody would dare come here!

1069
01:18:48,422 --> 01:18:50,197
What are you looking at?
Bring your wife.

1070
01:18:56,997 --> 01:18:58,135
Leave m e!

1071
01:19:29,363 --> 01:19:32,833
Hey Shankar! Are you here?

1072
01:19:39,373 --> 01:19:40,852
Is Ravi aka Shankar?

1073
01:19:41,041 --> 01:19:43,385
I'm searching for you
all over the country,

1074
01:19:43,811 --> 01:19:45,381
are you hiding here?

1075
01:19:45,813 --> 01:19:49,192
Poorna, plant tree,
it'll give you shade,

1076
01:19:49,383 --> 01:19:50,361
rear dog,
it'll be your companion,

1077
01:19:50,751 --> 01:19:54,358
don't seek revenge,
it'll take your life.

1078
01:19:55,823 --> 01:19:59,862
Never touch landmine and
people like me in underground.

1079
01:20:01,161 --> 01:20:04,938
Though you've changed the place,
your voice hasn't lost its base!

1080
01:20:05,165 --> 01:20:07,372
Same speed...same arrogance!

1081
01:20:08,168 --> 01:20:11,047
But I got you at right time!

1082
01:20:11,405 --> 01:20:12,884
Kill him, boys!

1083
01:21:01,355 --> 01:21:02,925
How come he's here?

1084
01:21:06,026 --> 01:21:07,334
Father and son would be together,

1085
01:21:07,795 --> 01:21:08,773
would they live separately?

1086
01:21:10,230 --> 01:21:11,470
Are they father and son?

1087
01:21:11,899 --> 01:21:16,939
They were after each other's life!
Sworn enemies!

1088
01:21:23,510 --> 01:21:26,286
Famous rowdy sheeters in Vizag!

1089
01:21:26,847 --> 01:21:29,453
Shankar and Nanaii! It's them!

1090
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:04,490
I'm combing entire country
for them only!

1091
01:22:10,958 --> 01:22:12,335
Better to escape from here!

1092
01:22:40,554 --> 01:22:44,525
Father. . .father...

1093
01:22:45,259 --> 01:22:48,206
Father. . .father...

1094
01:22:49,229 --> 01:22:50,537
Come...
- Leave me.

1095
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:53,910
Father!

1096
01:22:54,134 --> 01:23:02,383
If you're a man,
come to Vizag and take her.

1097
01:23:40,514 --> 01:23:42,255
Lock her up inside!

1098
01:23:44,184 --> 01:23:47,631
Whatever you may do,
you'll marry my nephew!

1099
01:23:48,055 --> 01:23:53,300
Shankar will come here for you.
I'll kill him here.

1100
01:23:53,527 --> 01:23:54,437
Super sir!

1101
01:23:58,065 --> 01:24:00,443
Who are you?
- My name is Crazy Mohan sir.

1102
01:24:00,634 --> 01:24:01,442
Shruthi's maternal uncle.

1103
01:24:01,668 --> 01:24:05,115
I hid in boot to avoid violence
in temple and came out here.

1104
01:24:05,305 --> 01:24:07,182
Looks like we travelled
quite a long distance.

1105
01:24:07,407 --> 01:24:09,182
Where are we now, sir?
- Vizag!

1106
01:24:09,409 --> 01:24:11,650
No need of that much respect, sir.

1107
01:24:12,079 --> 01:24:15,458
I want to see you cutting him
into pieces, sir.

1108
01:24:15,649 --> 01:24:17,993
He didn't torture me
ordinarily, sir. - Uncle!

1109
01:24:18,218 --> 01:24:19,526
Yes, I'm your uncle saying this.

1110
01:24:20,020 --> 01:24:22,626
Forget him and marry Rohit.
It'll be crazy.

1111
01:24:25,993 --> 01:24:27,301
I'll manage her.

1112
01:24:42,342 --> 01:24:46,017
They said 48 hours
observation is enough.

1113
01:24:46,246 --> 01:24:47,156
Father will be fine.

1114
01:24:47,347 --> 01:24:49,156
What's all this?
Who are they?

1115
01:24:49,449 --> 01:24:51,554
Are you two rowdies?
What had really happened?

1116
01:24:53,587 --> 01:24:55,658
Kill Shankar!

1117
01:24:57,024 --> 01:24:58,662
Shankar is my man!

1118
01:24:59,726 --> 01:25:02,502
I'll kill Nanaji!

1119
01:25:05,132 --> 01:25:08,170
Few years earlier...
Visakhapatnam

1120
01:25:32,092 --> 01:25:34,265
Greetings!
- Who are you?

1121
01:25:34,494 --> 01:25:35,598
Stop boys!

1122
01:25:36,396 --> 01:25:39,707
He's new to this area,
he must know about us, right?

1123
01:25:44,838 --> 01:25:45,407
Nanaii!

1124
01:25:45,639 --> 01:25:48,210
Just a name only,
where are you and what do you do?

1125
01:25:48,408 --> 01:25:49,751
What's the business you do?

1126
01:25:50,177 --> 01:25:52,623
Just show this to anyone here,
they'll give the details.

1127
01:25:52,846 --> 01:25:54,223
Only two people are popular in Wag,

1128
01:25:54,414 --> 01:25:57,224
One is Lord Simhadri Appanna
and second is Settlement Nanaii!

1129
01:25:57,517 --> 01:25:59,087
Police records show
as rowdy sheeter,

1130
01:25:59,319 --> 01:26:00,627
public call me as VIP,

1131
01:26:01,121 --> 01:26:02,225
though there's divide about character,

1132
01:26:02,456 --> 01:26:04,629
it's unanimous about capacity!

1133
01:26:04,858 --> 01:26:08,635
To do anything legal here
or legal business,

1134
01:26:09,096 --> 01:26:11,235
one need Nanaii's support
and certificate!

1135
01:26:11,431 --> 01:26:12,432
What to do?

1136
01:26:12,666 --> 01:26:14,646
We came from Mumbai,

1137
01:26:14,868 --> 01:26:16,313
and started many
businesses here without knowing this.

1138
01:26:16,536 --> 01:26:19,312
I'm giving you two offers for
your business to go on smoothly.

1139
01:26:19,539 --> 01:26:22,645
One is shares,
50-50 in every deal,

1140
01:26:22,876 --> 01:26:27,586
register all the lands and
businesses on my name.

1141
01:26:27,781 --> 01:26:30,591
We'll pay you monthly salary,
one day off every week,

1142
01:26:30,784 --> 01:26:32,320
food and drinks are free!
What do you say?

1143
01:26:34,888 --> 01:26:37,334
Do you consider yourself
a big rowdy?

1144
01:26:37,557 --> 01:26:39,468
Look at your clothes and slippers.

1145
01:26:39,693 --> 01:26:41,138
You look like a cheap chit business man.

1146
01:26:41,361 --> 01:26:45,673
Would I get afraid if you come
in a Scorpio with few men?

1147
01:26:47,367 --> 01:26:51,110
Does he look like a rowdy to you?
- No!

1148
01:26:51,304 --> 01:26:53,614
You gave me two options, right?

1149
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:57,287
I'm giving you only one option.
Get lost!

1150
01:27:05,719 --> 01:27:07,357
Watch now, how he appears!

1151
01:27:07,587 --> 01:27:09,828
Should I come in suit and
boot to meet you?

1152
01:27:10,257 --> 01:27:12,635
Vizag is hot place!

1153
01:27:12,859 --> 01:27:15,635
See history not get up!

1154
01:27:16,263 --> 01:27:17,503
I made a mistake Nanaii bhai!

1155
01:27:17,731 --> 01:27:20,371
Share option is okay to me,
take it 50-50!

1156
01:27:21,401 --> 01:27:23,176
You're not that lucky man!

1157
01:27:23,403 --> 01:27:25,474
Where's the registrar?

1158
01:27:29,743 --> 01:27:31,484
Name sir?
- Ham Lal!

1159
01:27:41,288 --> 01:27:43,859
Your property has been transferred
to my name, sign it.

1160
01:27:44,291 --> 01:27:45,736
Forgive me, Nanaii bhai!

1161
01:27:54,568 --> 01:27:57,549
If you want to do business
in Vizag with Poorna's support,

1162
01:27:57,771 --> 01:27:59,842
all you can do is
sell snacks on beach!

1163
01:28:26,233 --> 01:28:27,541
Who are you?

1164
01:28:32,906 --> 01:28:35,910
If house is on fire,
fire engine will come,

1165
01:28:36,343 --> 01:28:38,380
if your body burns,
ambulance will come,

1166
01:28:38,578 --> 01:28:41,889
if your fate turns worse,
Shankar will com e.

1167
01:28:42,582 --> 01:28:43,925
He's Kancharapalem Shankar, brother!

1168
01:28:44,351 --> 01:28:46,922
He's new to the field but
whatever he said is almost right.

1169
01:28:47,354 --> 01:28:53,236
Nanaii, send him and
his documents to me.

1170
01:28:53,493 --> 01:28:55,564
How dare you raise
your voice before him!

1171
01:28:56,830 --> 01:29:01,802
Generally my voice has base!
My hands itch too much!

1172
01:29:02,302 --> 01:29:05,806
Totally I'm very arrogant!

1173
01:29:06,273 --> 01:29:07,411
Kill him boys!

1174
01:30:39,032 --> 01:30:42,377
Brother, Kancharpalem Shankar is
coming with the builder.

1175
01:30:42,602 --> 01:30:45,708
It seems he bashed up entire
Nanaii's gang.- Really?

1176
01:30:45,939 --> 01:30:46,917
His name is Poorna!

1177
01:30:47,140 --> 01:30:50,917
He wants to become no:1 rowdy
in Vizag going against Nanaii,

1178
01:30:51,144 --> 01:30:53,021
and is waiting for an opportunity!

1179
01:30:53,713 --> 01:30:55,386
He's Poorna's elder son Babii.

1180
01:30:55,615 --> 01:30:58,687
He's short tern per!
Short fuse no brain!

1181
01:30:59,085 --> 01:31:02,726
He's Poorna's younger son Kasi.
Poorna dotes on him.

1182
01:31:02,956 --> 01:31:04,731
While his father and brother
play with humans,

1183
01:31:04,958 --> 01:31:05,936
he plays chess!

1184
01:31:06,426 --> 01:31:10,932
Didn't I tell you?
Once Shankar decides, job's done!

1185
01:31:11,164 --> 01:31:13,041
King has entered!

1186
01:31:16,636 --> 01:31:19,082
Poorna bhai, I thought
who would you send,

1187
01:31:19,506 --> 01:31:21,383
but you sent a missile!

1188
01:31:21,574 --> 01:31:24,054
I'm paying Rs.10 lakhs more
than what we decided.

1189
01:31:24,444 --> 01:31:25,548
Keep it.

1190
01:31:25,845 --> 01:31:27,415
Lion...you're a lion!

1191
01:31:27,647 --> 01:31:30,560
Some day you'll be NO:1 in Vizag!

1192
01:31:35,522 --> 01:31:36,899
'Balupu' Shankar!

1193
01:31:37,190 --> 01:31:39,761
I heard about you,
I saw your power now!

1194
01:31:39,993 --> 01:31:43,065
I like you.
- Is it marriage proposal to like?

1195
01:31:44,664 --> 01:31:46,405
If you pay, we'll go.

1196
01:31:48,435 --> 01:31:49,641
Not just his payment,

1197
01:31:49,869 --> 01:31:51,974
I'll make you an offer
you can't refuse.

1198
01:31:52,205 --> 01:31:54,446
From now work under me.

1199
01:31:54,674 --> 01:31:58,417
Am I donkey or horse
to work under you?

1200
01:31:59,446 --> 01:32:00,754
Broth er got it.

1201
01:32:01,781 --> 01:32:03,590
Let's work together!

1202
01:32:04,117 --> 01:32:07,098
We're 50-50 partners in
everything from today!

1203
01:32:07,487 --> 01:32:08,431
Please sit down.

1204
01:32:21,468 --> 01:32:21,673
What's this?

1205
01:32:21,901 --> 01:32:24,142
Your father said just now
let's work together.

1206
01:32:24,571 --> 01:32:26,608
It'Il be like this only.
Okay?

1207
01:32:28,575 --> 01:32:30,111
Shekhar, give me Rs.50000.

1208
01:32:33,580 --> 01:32:36,789
You said 50-50 partnership,
let's start with this.

1209
01:32:37,050 --> 01:32:38,461
You wait!

1210
01:32:38,818 --> 01:32:41,162
Shankar, take whatever you want,

1211
01:32:41,588 --> 01:32:44,831
From today we must encroach
every business of Nanaii!

1212
01:32:45,058 --> 01:32:46,628
It's not that easy to encroach
Nanaii's business.

1213
01:32:46,826 --> 01:32:47,964
He can never do it.

1214
01:32:48,595 --> 01:32:50,973
Fearless man can interfere
in anything.

1215
01:32:51,197 --> 01:32:52,471
We're doing it.

1216
01:33:00,607 --> 01:33:02,712
What's this brother?
Did you see his arrogance?

1217
01:33:02,942 --> 01:33:05,650
His name is 'Balupu' Shankar!
- Shut up!

1218
01:33:05,845 --> 01:33:08,155
Do we need to business with him?
I don't like it.

1219
01:33:09,082 --> 01:33:13,997
We keep it near our navel,
not for love.

1220
01:33:14,220 --> 01:33:15,164
For necessity!

1221
01:33:15,855 --> 01:33:19,826
At last I found a
devastating hum an weapon!

1222
01:33:20,627 --> 01:33:21,662
Let's use it.

1223
01:33:22,095 --> 01:33:24,871
Die, you fatso!
I'll kill you!

1224
01:33:25,098 --> 01:33:26,076
What's this?

1225
01:33:26,299 --> 01:33:29,678
Look daddy!
He killed my Jingle Raja!

1226
01:33:29,969 --> 01:33:32,745
Look!
- You mustn't shoot like that.

1227
01:33:32,972 --> 01:33:34,679
Okay, father.

1228
01:33:43,883 --> 01:33:45,226
Tell me the details.
- Where's the emergency ward?

1229
01:33:46,786 --> 01:33:48,766
What's his condition?
- Already told you, right?

1230
01:33:50,123 --> 01:33:51,033
Why are you still here?

1231
01:33:51,257 --> 01:33:52,031
Didn't start the treatment yet?

1232
01:33:52,258 --> 01:33:53,760
It seems rowdies will not
be treated here, brother.

1233
01:33:53,993 --> 01:33:55,199
Who said that?

1234
01:33:55,595 --> 01:33:57,575
Who ever may have said that,
but the concept is our doctor's.

1235
01:33:57,797 --> 01:33:59,572
Who is the doctor? Show me!
- Com e, brother.

1236
01:33:59,799 --> 01:34:02,541
He's finished,
won't he treat rowdies?

1237
01:34:19,586 --> 01:34:21,224
Look there, she's our doctor.

1238
01:34:47,981 --> 01:34:49,824
You're anemic, grandpa!

1239
01:34:50,049 --> 01:34:51,926
I told you to take lots of fruits.

1240
01:34:53,620 --> 01:34:57,261
No money to buy medicines,
how can we buy fruits?

1241
01:34:58,725 --> 01:35:00,762
Dr.Savithri. Psychiatrist

1242
01:35:03,796 --> 01:35:05,776
I must impress her today
at any cost!

1243
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:08,172
What's your idea?

1244
01:35:08,635 --> 01:35:10,171
Do you want her to finance
you along with treatment?

1245
01:35:10,670 --> 01:35:12,308
What's wrong if I do?
Poor people!

1246
01:35:12,739 --> 01:35:15,777
You're right, I too will
help them what I can.

1247
01:35:16,009 --> 01:35:19,957
Okay, give.
I'll distribute on your name.- Okay.

1248
01:35:21,014 --> 01:35:23,187
I told about our matter
with my people,

1249
01:35:23,650 --> 01:35:24,321
they said okay.

1250
01:35:24,684 --> 01:35:25,992
I've stopped talking to my people.

1251
01:35:26,219 --> 01:35:28,130
If you tell about our marriage
with your people.

1252
01:35:28,321 --> 01:35:30,130
It'll be good, right?
They may...

1253
01:35:30,356 --> 01:35:32,199
why don't you listen to me?

1254
01:35:36,763 --> 01:35:38,970
Hey you!
- Calling you only!

1255
01:35:39,699 --> 01:35:40,200
Who are you guys?

1256
01:35:40,667 --> 01:35:42,010
I refused to treat him, right?

1257
01:35:42,235 --> 01:35:44,010
Are you here to threaten me?
I'll not treat him.

1258
01:35:44,237 --> 01:35:46,683
No! I'll not agree even if
you want to treat him.

1259
01:35:46,906 --> 01:35:47,976
I came to tell you that.

1260
01:35:48,908 --> 01:35:51,821
How manytimes I've told you
rowdyism will hurt you?

1261
01:35:52,011 --> 01:35:53,820
He'll never listen to me.

1262
01:35:54,447 --> 01:35:57,360
That's why it's my policy
not to treat goons like him.

1263
01:35:57,784 --> 01:35:58,888
You've my full support.

1264
01:35:59,118 --> 01:36:03,032
But I feel very sad thinking
about his mother's condition.

1265
01:36:03,256 --> 01:36:04,894
Is she also a rowdy?
- No.- Then?

1266
01:36:05,124 --> 01:36:06,831
His brother-in-law dumped
his sister after marriage,

1267
01:36:07,026 --> 01:36:07,902
younger sister dumped her husband,

1268
01:36:08,127 --> 01:36:09,902
unable to bear this,
his father left this world,

1269
01:36:10,129 --> 01:36:11,904
with that his mother
lost interest in life.

1270
01:36:12,131 --> 01:36:13,166
What did he gave up then?

1271
01:36:13,933 --> 01:36:14,911
Unable to give up anyone,

1272
01:36:15,134 --> 01:36:18,240
he became a rowdy to
support his family.

1273
01:36:19,706 --> 01:36:20,343
Yes.

1274
01:36:20,940 --> 01:36:23,921
Promise madam to give up rowdyism!

1275
01:36:24,143 --> 01:36:28,717
Doctor, even on facing death,
I'll stay away from rowdyism.

1276
01:36:28,948 --> 01:36:31,019
Then, I'll treat him.

1277
01:36:38,057 --> 01:36:40,264
Are you a musician?

1278
01:36:40,493 --> 01:36:42,404
Yes! My name is Ravi, I play violin.

1279
01:36:42,829 --> 01:36:44,399
We've a very big music troupe in city.

1280
01:36:44,831 --> 01:36:45,741
That's a guitar, right?

1281
01:36:45,965 --> 01:36:50,038
I can play any musical instrument.

1282
01:36:50,403 --> 01:36:53,941
My father is violin player,
my mother is music teacher.

1283
01:36:54,173 --> 01:36:55,948
Are you a king performer then?

1284
01:36:56,175 --> 01:36:57,711
Are you from llayaraja's family?

1285
01:37:00,179 --> 01:37:01,283
Give respect to artistes.

1286
01:37:01,514 --> 01:37:03,960
Savithri? Who is she?
- It's me!

1287
01:37:04,450 --> 01:37:07,897
My grandma died when I was born,
I was named after her.

1288
01:37:09,922 --> 01:37:10,900
What's that?

1289
01:37:12,191 --> 01:37:12,965
It seems Psychiatrist!

1290
01:37:13,192 --> 01:37:14,899
You too can join his troupe, right?

1291
01:37:15,094 --> 01:37:19,065
I too suggested that.
Join, you can join the chorus.

1292
01:37:19,332 --> 01:37:20,743
What?
- My guitar!

1293
01:37:21,200 --> 01:37:22,406
Is this your guitar?

1294
01:37:22,869 --> 01:37:24,371
Got late by half an hour,

1295
01:37:24,804 --> 01:37:26,977
students have come searching for master.
Take it, dear.

1296
01:37:27,206 --> 01:37:28,742
Practice in park.
- Practice?

1297
01:37:28,941 --> 01:37:29,783
Take her away.
- Okay.

1298
01:37:30,009 --> 01:37:31,750
Go!
- Come dear.

1299
01:37:32,211 --> 01:37:34,248
My men too along with them...

1300
01:37:34,447 --> 01:37:36,324
You too can take him now.

1301
01:37:36,549 --> 01:37:38,324
Give these tablets for 2 days.
- Okay.

1302
01:37:38,785 --> 01:37:40,128
I see difference in body language,

1303
01:37:40,353 --> 01:37:41,764
have you fallen for that doctor?

1304
01:37:41,954 --> 01:37:45,265
Forget about that,
I can do anything for her.

1305
01:37:47,460 --> 01:37:51,101
Performer! Are you my competitor?

1306
01:37:56,469 --> 01:38:00,940
I'm Violinist Ravi here.
- You? Tell me.

1307
01:38:01,808 --> 01:38:04,345
He wants to take bath,
you've bandaged his head,

1308
01:38:04,811 --> 01:38:06,017
can he take bath or not?

1309
01:38:06,245 --> 01:38:07,485
You can do anything without
wetting the bandage.

1310
01:38:07,914 --> 01:38:09,291
He can take bath then.

1311
01:38:17,256 --> 01:38:22,365
He has decided to eat well,
can he eat chicken or fish?

1312
01:38:22,862 --> 01:38:24,842
Your friend didn't have
any major operation,

1313
01:38:25,064 --> 01:38:26,304
he can eat whatever
he feels like eating.

1314
01:38:34,841 --> 01:38:38,516
He wants to sleep now,
can he sleep straight or face down?

1315
01:38:38,945 --> 01:38:40,481
He can sleep as he likes.

1316
01:38:45,284 --> 01:38:49,391
None of these fools cared about me.

1317
01:38:49,856 --> 01:38:51,836
Why do you love me so much?

1318
01:38:53,025 --> 01:38:54,197
What did the doctor say?

1319
01:38:54,427 --> 01:38:57,340
You think I was talking about you?

1320
01:38:58,898 --> 01:39:00,844
To get closer to doctor.

1321
01:39:05,538 --> 01:39:07,518
Bloody emotions! Shut up!

1322
01:39:10,309 --> 01:39:12,346
Police Commissioner's Office
Visakhapatnam

1323
01:39:12,578 --> 01:39:14,524
You praised him as
machine gun and missile.

1324
01:39:14,914 --> 01:39:17,417
I said don't make him partner,
now we've to go after him.

1325
01:39:17,884 --> 01:39:19,557
This is what you call carrying
cat to attend marriage.

1326
01:39:19,986 --> 01:39:21,897
Do we need him?
- Forget about him.

1327
01:39:22,121 --> 01:39:24,567
I'm tensed about
why Commissioner has called us.

1328
01:39:24,991 --> 01:39:27,562
If we get into rowdyism,
won't police call us?

1329
01:39:27,994 --> 01:39:29,098
When your range goes up,
this is normal,

1330
01:39:29,328 --> 01:39:30,864
let's find what the matter is, come!

1331
01:39:38,905 --> 01:39:40,384
Greetings sir.
- Greetings.

1332
01:39:41,340 --> 01:39:42,546
Why did you call us, uncle?

1333
01:39:46,913 --> 01:39:48,915
Uncle?
Am I your relative?

1334
01:39:49,148 --> 01:39:51,059
Uncle! Do we call
Gandhi as grandpa

1335
01:39:51,250 --> 01:39:53,457
and Nehru as uncle
with relationship?

1336
01:39:53,920 --> 01:39:55,558
No,with affection!
This is also like that.

1337
01:40:01,093 --> 01:40:04,074
No sugar in coffee,
so you're a diabetic.

1338
01:40:04,297 --> 01:40:05,241
You please have it.

1339
01:40:05,598 --> 01:40:08,135
I've already warned you twice, Poorna.

1340
01:40:08,367 --> 01:40:09,141
What's the trouble in
quarry yesterday

1341
01:40:09,368 --> 01:40:10,278
Why is he going overboard?

1342
01:40:10,503 --> 01:40:11,607
New?
- Sir, that is...

1343
01:40:12,038 --> 01:40:13,244
Stop your meeting!

1344
01:40:13,973 --> 01:40:16,146
Did you call us for empty banter?

1345
01:40:16,375 --> 01:40:17,410
I would've killed him last night,

1346
01:40:17,610 --> 01:40:18,918
you told me to wait, sol stopped.

1347
01:40:19,111 --> 01:40:20,613
Arrest them and break their bones.

1348
01:40:21,047 --> 01:40:24,426
If domination is so high,
I think you'd have got big bucks!

1349
01:40:26,052 --> 01:40:28,589
Did you see his arrogance?
- You haven't yet seen anything.

1350
01:40:28,955 --> 01:40:30,491
There's much more to see!

1351
01:40:32,058 --> 01:40:32,502
What the hell are you talking?

1352
01:40:32,992 --> 01:40:35,165
That too before Commissioner.
- You keep quiet.

1353
01:40:35,394 --> 01:40:37,635
Uncle, his notes will have
Gandhi's photo,

1354
01:40:38,064 --> 01:40:40,442
and the notes we give don't
have Mumaith Khan's photo,

1355
01:40:40,633 --> 01:40:43,443
we'll double what he pays,
cooperate with us.

1356
01:40:48,975 --> 01:40:52,184
If you fire bullets and
if I fire will chocolates come out?

1357
01:40:52,411 --> 01:40:54,982
We've nine openings in body,

1358
01:40:55,214 --> 01:40:57,660
press trigger and it'll become ten!

1359
01:40:58,084 --> 01:41:02,191
Wait...wait...you go Nanaji,
I'll handle them.

1360
01:41:02,421 --> 01:41:04,662
I'll go now,
if they cross my path again,

1361
01:41:05,091 --> 01:41:06,968
I'll kill you also
along with them.

1362
01:41:07,426 --> 01:41:10,464
I didn't pay you money
to watch show like women.

1363
01:41:12,431 --> 01:41:13,637
Call me after job is done.

1364
01:41:16,102 --> 01:41:16,944
What did you say now?

1365
01:41:17,103 --> 01:41:19,674
He said in arrogance,
we don't support him, sir.

1366
01:41:20,106 --> 01:41:23,553
You tell me.
- Uncle, I said earlier and now again.

1367
01:41:24,043 --> 01:41:25,147
Shankar, go out!

1368
01:41:25,344 --> 01:41:28,655
Why should he go out?
Deal is attractive!

1369
01:41:30,249 --> 01:41:32,490
Nanaii has become too proud!

1370
01:41:32,718 --> 01:41:34,493
If his pride has to come down,

1371
01:41:35,021 --> 01:41:35,999
his arrogance is the right medicine.

1372
01:41:36,188 --> 01:41:37,565
I'll support you fully.

1373
01:41:40,126 --> 01:41:41,503
Poorna, you found a man with good
caliber

1374
01:41:41,694 --> 01:41:45,005
and calculative mind.

1375
01:41:47,133 --> 01:41:48,510
Use him carefully.

1376
01:42:23,836 --> 01:42:29,286
Shift 20 acres of land given to Nanaii,

1377
01:42:29,508 --> 01:42:31,385
on beach road for development to Poorna.

1378
01:43:21,560 --> 01:43:24,598
Oh my God! Is this what you play?

1379
01:43:26,699 --> 01:43:30,146
Did you see everything Savithri?
- Unfortunately l did.

1380
01:43:30,369 --> 01:43:31,347
Will you tell everything to Anjali?

1381
01:43:31,570 --> 01:43:33,447
I've decided to tell.

1382
01:43:34,573 --> 01:43:36,610
I didn't see anything
and I'll not anything.

1383
01:43:44,383 --> 01:43:48,126
Enough of telling me!
Kill Shankar!

1384
01:43:49,321 --> 01:43:52,461
Do you've to bring me here
to select a shirt?

1385
01:43:55,261 --> 01:43:58,265
I mean your taste will be good,
so...l brought you here.

1386
01:44:00,266 --> 01:44:03,304
Did she come here?
- I saw her walking in.

1387
01:44:03,502 --> 01:44:04,310
Where is she then?

1388
01:44:05,271 --> 01:44:06,306
There!

1389
01:44:07,606 --> 01:44:08,482
See that one!

1390
01:44:13,879 --> 01:44:15,153
Isn't this good?

1391
01:44:20,419 --> 01:44:21,397
That's why I asked you.

1392
01:44:21,854 --> 01:44:24,164
He got caught red handed.

1393
01:44:24,857 --> 01:44:27,269
Look there, he looks like Ravi!

1394
01:44:29,228 --> 01:44:32,209
Nobody is there.
- Missed him.

1395
01:44:32,431 --> 01:44:35,207
I think this old stock, not so good.

1396
01:44:35,434 --> 01:44:37,675
Let's go out, there are
many shops. Let's go out.

1397
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:41,884
Where is he? Missed him!

1398
01:44:42,308 --> 01:44:44,686
What are you searching?

1399
01:44:44,910 --> 01:44:47,754
There was a shop here, missed it.

1400
01:44:51,884 --> 01:44:52,692
Got him.

1401
01:44:52,985 --> 01:44:53,520
Anjali, see there, 40% discount!

1402
01:44:55,888 --> 01:44:58,698
That's ladies showroom!

1403
01:45:01,460 --> 01:45:03,371
What's this she never sees
when I show? She misses him.

1404
01:45:03,562 --> 01:45:04,700
What am I missing?

1405
01:45:04,897 --> 01:45:05,898
Your health is fine, right?

1406
01:45:06,332 --> 01:45:09,245
My health is fine,
but he's missing.

1407
01:45:09,468 --> 01:45:11,709
Let's do one thing,
shall we go to another shop?

1408
01:45:23,282 --> 01:45:25,922
Brother, save me...
- Tell me who sent you?

1409
01:45:26,352 --> 01:45:27,797
Brother!
- Is it Nanaii?

1410
01:45:28,020 --> 01:45:31,467
Nanaii!
- I'll kill Nanaii!

1411
01:45:32,424 --> 01:45:34,267
Brothel'...brothel'...l beg you!

1412
01:45:34,493 --> 01:45:36,564
Hold him tightly, don't leave him.

1413
01:45:37,029 --> 01:45:37,939
Save him!
- Anjali?

1414
01:45:38,364 --> 01:45:39,741
I think he's killing
not saving him.

1415
01:45:39,932 --> 01:45:42,742
Will you please stop?
He's serving him.

1416
01:45:44,503 --> 01:45:45,914
Ravi, Hold him carefully.

1417
01:45:47,039 --> 01:45:48,484
Hold him carefully.
- I beg you, brother.

1418
01:45:48,707 --> 01:45:50,414
Hold him.
- She's unable to understand me.

1419
01:45:50,609 --> 01:45:52,816
He may fall down.
Don't leave him!

1420
01:45:53,279 --> 01:45:54,622
Pull him up!

1421
01:45:54,847 --> 01:45:57,760
Come, your time is good.
Got saved!

1422
01:45:58,617 --> 01:45:59,755
Come...com e...
- Thanks brother.

1423
01:46:02,454 --> 01:46:04,764
Why do you want to commit suicide?

1424
01:46:05,858 --> 01:46:07,769
Tell her...come on!

1425
01:46:07,960 --> 01:46:10,600
Tell it's love failure!
- Yes.

1426
01:46:11,730 --> 01:46:13,641
Love failure?

1427
01:46:13,866 --> 01:46:15,937
Do you know the value of life?
Do you know it?

1428
01:46:17,469 --> 01:46:19,972
Normally, what's the lifespan
of any human?

1429
01:46:20,406 --> 01:46:22,784
For the present situation,
60 years...

1430
01:46:23,008 --> 01:46:25,955
We should live 100
but living only 60!

1431
01:46:26,345 --> 01:46:28,450
We spend 25 years
for education and work.

1432
01:46:28,647 --> 01:46:29,523
10 years to sleep.

1433
01:46:29,748 --> 01:46:32,991
For eating, watching TV and
entertainment, we spend 15 years.

1434
01:46:33,419 --> 01:46:35,456
For the traffic now,
another 5 years is lost.

1435
01:46:35,754 --> 01:46:36,858
What are we left with?

1436
01:46:38,557 --> 01:46:40,468
Don't talk anymore.
We're left with just 5 years.

1437
01:46:40,659 --> 01:46:41,467
Instead of living for yourself,

1438
01:46:41,660 --> 01:46:43,469
why do you want to commit suicide?

1439
01:46:43,862 --> 01:46:44,863
Isn't it wrong?

1440
01:46:45,331 --> 01:46:45,963
I made a mistake, please forgive me.

1441
01:46:45,964 --> 01:46:46,965
Get up, I don't like this.

1442
01:46:47,366 --> 01:46:49,812
If you do it again, I'll kill you.

1443
01:46:50,002 --> 01:46:51,811
Go..go...
- Bye.

1444
01:46:52,371 --> 01:46:53,816
Yo're Super,Ravi!

1445
01:46:54,707 --> 01:46:58,484
You made him normal in one minute,
you're not an ordinary man.

1446
01:46:58,711 --> 01:47:00,019
That's your affection!
- Yes,

1447
01:47:00,446 --> 01:47:01,481
he's not an ordinary man.

1448
01:47:02,014 --> 01:47:03,823
I need a small help.

1449
01:47:04,383 --> 01:47:05,885
You hurt me by asking.
Order me.

1450
01:47:07,119 --> 01:47:08,359
There are few patients in my hospital

1451
01:47:08,587 --> 01:47:09,827
who have lost hope in life.

1452
01:47:10,022 --> 01:47:12,559
You must come and
motivate them also.

1453
01:47:12,791 --> 01:47:14,566
What's our program for tomorrow?

1454
01:47:14,793 --> 01:47:16,329
We've to play in Andhra University.

1455
01:47:16,929 --> 01:47:17,737
Let's play day after tomorrow.

1456
01:47:19,365 --> 01:47:21,675
Please come.
I was waiting for you.

1457
01:47:22,368 --> 01:47:24,905
Traffic jam near Kailashagiri.
- No problem.

1458
01:47:25,371 --> 01:47:26,679
Where are the patients?

1459
01:47:30,609 --> 01:47:32,850
You're praising me too much.

1460
01:47:33,545 --> 01:47:34,046
0h my God!
- What happened?

1461
01:47:34,480 --> 01:47:35,390
How come so many are here?

1462
01:47:35,614 --> 01:47:36,854
Did you invite public too?

1463
01:47:37,049 --> 01:47:39,529
They're not public but my patients.

1464
01:47:39,718 --> 01:47:42,597
He needs machine gun to
motivate so many people.- Shut up.

1465
01:47:42,821 --> 01:47:46,860
Many are affected with
different chronic diseases.

1466
01:47:47,092 --> 01:47:49,538
Chronic disease?

1467
01:47:49,762 --> 01:47:51,366
Tonic will relieve chronic, right?

1468
01:47:51,563 --> 01:47:53,406
Why did you call me instead?
Let's go.

1469
01:47:53,632 --> 01:47:56,704
You've good sense of humour.
You must share it with them.

1470
01:47:58,637 --> 01:48:02,414
Friends, I'm going to introduce
a great man to you.

1471
01:48:02,641 --> 01:48:04,552
He's a great musician!

1472
01:48:04,843 --> 01:48:07,722
A man who can bring lightning
changes in our attitude.

1473
01:48:12,751 --> 01:48:13,889
Go!
_ Go!

1474
01:48:15,421 --> 01:48:17,401
He's a musician!!

1475
01:48:17,589 --> 01:48:19,626
He'll fall from the pedestal
in the eyes of Anjali,

1476
01:48:19,858 --> 01:48:21,633
I'll get into his place!

1477
01:48:22,761 --> 01:48:23,967
Greetings sir.

1478
01:48:27,599 --> 01:48:30,580
Keep this bouquet with you.
- Great!

1479
01:48:32,805 --> 01:48:36,753
They know the numbers after that,
tell them the actual matter.

1480
01:48:37,776 --> 01:48:41,918
To doctors on dais,
to patients in audience,

1481
01:48:42,114 --> 01:48:43,650
to chief doctor Anjali,

1482
01:48:43,882 --> 01:48:46,761
my blessings...no, my greetings!

1483
01:48:47,453 --> 01:48:50,457
Yes...that is...
life is very precious.

1484
01:48:50,689 --> 01:48:55,934
You must take medicines and
injections as suggested by doctor.

1485
01:48:57,796 --> 01:49:02,609
As our doctor Anjali says
eat good food.

1486
01:49:02,835 --> 01:49:05,611
Eat fruits!
Apple, pomegranate!

1487
01:49:05,904 --> 01:49:09,681
Sweet lime...
take either juice or fruit.

1488
01:49:09,908 --> 01:49:11,945
Seeds?
- Spit it out.

1489
01:49:16,915 --> 01:49:19,623
'If While we were in college...
- You...

1490
01:49:24,523 --> 01:49:27,629
They used to live on leaves and
tubers in Sri Krishnadevaraya's period.

1491
01:49:27,926 --> 01:49:30,634
Lord Rama went to forest for 14 years,

1492
01:49:30,829 --> 01:49:33,503
saying
herbs are good and medicines are waste.

1493
01:49:33,732 --> 01:49:34,972
What's this nonsense?

1494
01:49:36,602 --> 01:49:38,479
You've been blabbering
for long time.

1495
01:49:39,271 --> 01:49:40,511
Doctor's don't have any work,

1496
01:49:40,739 --> 01:49:43,811
they bring a guest every week
and they blabber nonsense.

1497
01:49:45,277 --> 01:49:49,157
You'll understand when you stand
face to face with death!

1498
01:49:52,951 --> 01:49:54,157
Hack it!

1499
01:49:56,221 --> 01:49:59,532
Why do you discuss with enemy
if he's standing before you?

1500
01:49:59,758 --> 01:50:02,671
You stab him before he stabs you!

1501
01:50:02,861 --> 01:50:04,067
Either you or he must live!

1502
01:50:04,563 --> 01:50:07,510
Take head on him,
there's no greater man than you here.

1503
01:50:07,766 --> 01:50:08,870
What is death anyway?

1504
01:50:09,101 --> 01:50:10,205
Won't the doctor who treat you die?

1505
01:50:10,636 --> 01:50:12,513
Won't the scientist who invented it die?

1506
01:50:12,871 --> 01:50:14,748
Death is inevitable for all of us.

1507
01:50:14,973 --> 01:50:18,079
But there's a thing more dangerous
than death, do you know that?

1508
01:50:18,544 --> 01:50:20,683
Fear! Fear of death!

1509
01:50:20,879 --> 01:50:24,019
Kill it first!
It'll run away from you in fear.

1510
01:50:24,650 --> 01:50:26,027
Every hum an is
having some disease.

1511
01:50:26,552 --> 01:50:28,554
Some have disease of money
some have power disease.

1512
01:50:28,787 --> 01:50:30,767
Some have caste disease,
some have disease of religion,

1513
01:50:30,989 --> 01:50:34,027
when so many are living happily
with incurable diseases,

1514
01:50:34,259 --> 01:50:37,763
can't you live happily?

1515
01:50:37,996 --> 01:50:40,704
There are hospitals, medicines
for your diseases,

1516
01:50:40,899 --> 01:50:43,243
there are dedicated doctors
to take care of you,

1517
01:50:43,669 --> 01:50:45,114
will you get relief if you sit sad?

1518
01:50:45,337 --> 01:50:47,248
No it'll not, scare it away!

1519
01:50:47,673 --> 01:50:49,710
Fill your eyes with urge to live.

1520
01:50:50,342 --> 01:50:53,050
Any disease would run away in fear!

1521
01:50:57,149 --> 01:51:00,130
Why did I get so emotional.
There's no reaction!

1522
01:51:19,371 --> 01:51:21,078
We'll face hundreds of
diseases bravely,

1523
01:51:21,273 --> 01:51:23,753
with your inspiration
we'll kill death!

1524
01:51:23,976 --> 01:51:27,150
Yes, we'll kill any disease!

1525
01:51:27,379 --> 01:51:32,920
We'll kill fear in us.
We'll kill!

1526
01:51:33,852 --> 01:51:35,263
Go, give him a bouquet.

1527
01:51:38,657 --> 01:51:41,103
Did you see how you changed
them in minutes?

1528
01:51:41,393 --> 01:51:45,773
He changed them but you changed him.

1529
01:51:46,298 --> 01:51:51,304
Yes, he changed after meeting you,
his style of talking changed,

1530
01:51:51,737 --> 01:51:54,274
his style changed,
totally his life changed!

1531
01:52:00,078 --> 01:52:01,785
You've brought a dramatic
change in them.

1532
01:52:02,014 --> 01:52:03,186
What we couldn't do, you did it.

1533
01:52:03,415 --> 01:52:05,793
Thank you very much, Ravi.
- No need thank me.

1534
01:52:05,984 --> 01:52:07,190
You're responsible for all this.

1535
01:52:13,325 --> 01:52:14,861
Can I have a coffee with you?

1536
01:52:34,680 --> 01:52:37,024
The moment I saw you...

1537
01:52:37,249 --> 01:52:39,820
Waves of love hit me...

1538
01:52:40,018 --> 01:52:44,990
What happened to my heart
which slipped away?

1539
01:52:45,791 --> 01:52:48,237
Don't know what turn it saw...

1540
01:52:48,694 --> 01:52:51,038
Don't know whose call it heard...

1541
01:52:51,263 --> 01:52:55,336
What happened to my enchanted heart?

1542
01:52:56,368 --> 01:53:01,681
What happened to it
roaming around here?

1543
01:53:01,873 --> 01:53:10,691
Who am Ito ask
what has happened to it?

1544
01:53:12,284 --> 01:53:17,284
What has happened to it?
Please check it once...

1545
01:54:41,973 --> 01:54:46,353
Your acquaintance is
a boon to me...

1546
01:54:46,812 --> 01:54:52,490
You may believe it or not
if I tell...

1547
01:54:52,918 --> 01:54:58,834
When would you know this truth
which I can never tell...

1548
01:54:59,057 --> 01:55:04,302
Has my life of loneliness ended?

1549
01:55:04,496 --> 01:55:09,809
Has my life taken a new leaf
with your arrival?

1550
01:56:15,133 --> 01:56:16,874
Why is Poorna's son here?

1551
01:56:22,073 --> 01:56:24,883
How dare you give evidence
against Poorna?

1552
01:56:25,076 --> 01:56:27,556
Can you live in Vizag after that?
Can you?

1553
01:56:30,015 --> 01:56:31,050
Who are you guys?

1554
01:56:34,619 --> 01:56:37,896
She's Shankar's girl friend.
- Oh my God!

1555
01:56:38,356 --> 01:56:39,460
Is she Shankar's girl friend?

1556
01:56:39,925 --> 01:56:41,905
All of you please go out.

1557
01:56:42,360 --> 01:56:45,136
Your arrogance and your figure
both are damn good.

1558
01:56:45,363 --> 01:56:48,606
But fully covering yourself
is not good.

1559
01:56:49,034 --> 01:56:51,139
If you remove coat and
wear colourful sari,

1560
01:56:51,369 --> 01:56:53,076
you'll be sensational!

1561
01:56:53,305 --> 01:56:56,081
Your price range too hit peak!

1562
01:56:56,942 --> 01:56:57,147
Leave me.

1563
01:56:57,375 --> 01:57:01,084
I too want to get slapped
by you but not here.

1564
01:57:01,313 --> 01:57:04,419
Let's fight it out privately
in my bedroom!

1565
01:57:04,716 --> 01:57:06,423
Please leave her, sir.

1566
01:57:07,719 --> 01:57:10,256
Too many people around,
don't create trouble, com e.

1567
01:57:10,722 --> 01:57:11,598
Come!

1568
01:57:30,141 --> 01:57:31,279
Hey fatso!

1569
01:57:40,418 --> 01:57:42,125
Why are you beating him, Shankar?

1570
01:57:42,320 --> 01:57:43,663
He dared to touch my Anjali.

1571
01:57:44,089 --> 01:57:45,534
Is she your lover or wife?

1572
01:57:45,757 --> 01:57:47,532
You'll leave anyway after
using her for few days.

1573
01:57:52,330 --> 01:57:53,468
I'll kill you!

1574
01:57:53,665 --> 01:57:55,542
Anjali is my future wife!

1575
01:57:55,767 --> 01:57:58,145
Even if you think about her
I'll kill you!

1576
01:57:58,336 --> 01:58:02,307
Let it be anyone!
I'll kill them!

1577
01:58:06,244 --> 01:58:13,162
Never trouble Queen!
- Shut up! Bloody mad man!

1578
01:58:16,588 --> 01:58:19,569
Hey elder one!
- You praised him as top gun!

1579
01:58:20,025 --> 01:58:21,504
What happened now?
He beat me as you watched.

1580
01:58:21,693 --> 01:58:24,697
Emotions will not help,
think and win over him.

1581
01:58:25,130 --> 01:58:28,668
You keep thinking,
I'll take on him.

1582
01:58:29,801 --> 01:58:31,508
I'll go against him.

1583
01:58:52,223 --> 01:58:53,600
Aren't you so proud of your beauty?

1584
01:58:53,825 --> 01:58:55,532
I'll destroy it!

1585
01:59:07,839 --> 01:59:09,045
Stop g

1586
01:59:13,445 --> 01:59:14,389
Stop g

1587
01:59:19,417 --> 01:59:20,225
Stop g

1588
01:59:46,878 --> 01:59:49,256
You entered into my businesses,
I kept quiet,

1589
01:59:50,548 --> 01:59:53,427
you separated my people from me,
I was patient,

1590
01:59:55,453 --> 01:59:58,093
if you trouble my daughter,
I'll kill you!

1591
01:59:59,791 --> 02:00:02,328
Tell Poorna that if you go against
Nanaji,

1592
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:04,437
this will be the range of loss.

1593
02:00:23,314 --> 02:00:25,794
Had I come a minute late
what would have happened to you?

1594
02:00:26,584 --> 02:00:28,359
Can I live if anything
happens to you?

1595
02:00:29,487 --> 02:00:32,627
My dear, please leave the hostel

1596
02:00:32,824 --> 02:00:33,495
and stay with me in our home.

1597
02:00:33,725 --> 02:00:35,363
I've told you many times, father.

1598
02:00:35,593 --> 02:00:36,833
I'm staying in hostel not
because I don't like you,

1599
02:00:37,262 --> 02:00:38,366
Because l don't like what you do!

1600
02:00:38,596 --> 02:00:40,633
Promise to quit everything,
I'll stay with you.

1601
02:00:40,865 --> 02:00:44,472
What do you want?
You want me to quit this, right?

1602
02:00:45,170 --> 02:00:45,511
Brother!

1603
02:00:45,737 --> 02:00:49,310
Inform all our men,
everything is stopped!- Okay.

1604
02:00:49,941 --> 02:00:51,852
No more settlements from today.

1605
02:00:52,277 --> 02:00:52,846
All the illegal businesses
are shut down permanently.

1606
02:00:53,278 --> 02:00:57,317
Is it enough, dear?
Are you happy?

1607
02:00:57,949 --> 02:01:00,190
Brother, it seems Poorna has entered
our area

1608
02:01:00,418 --> 02:01:01,863
and burning down our shops.

1609
02:01:02,287 --> 02:01:03,857
Why did you come to me instead
of killing him there?

1610
02:01:04,289 --> 02:01:04,733
You wait!

1611
02:01:05,190 --> 02:01:08,728
Not one of their men must go out.
Kill everyone of them.

1612
02:01:13,298 --> 02:01:15,209
No, if his men are killing my men...

1613
02:01:15,433 --> 02:01:19,347
Enough, you'll never change.
You can't!

1614
02:01:20,772 --> 02:01:21,512
Dear...

1615
02:01:33,318 --> 02:01:36,697
Anjali, please listen to me.
- No, don't tell me anything.

1616
02:01:37,455 --> 02:01:39,196
I lost my mother as child,

1617
02:01:39,390 --> 02:01:40,562
My father, who would do
anything for me,

1618
02:01:40,792 --> 02:01:44,433
I tried years to wean him
away from rowdyism,

1619
02:01:44,662 --> 02:01:46,869
but now I'm living away from him.

1620
02:01:47,332 --> 02:01:50,370
You're the man I liked most
after my father, Ravi.

1621
02:01:51,002 --> 02:01:54,540
But you too are a rowdy...
why did you lie to me?

1622
02:01:55,240 --> 02:01:55,775
Tell me!

1623
02:01:56,241 --> 02:01:58,721
My mother gave birth and left me.
Would I become Collector?

1624
02:01:59,344 --> 02:02:00,789
Do you know how it would be to roam
without shirt

1625
02:02:01,246 --> 02:02:02,589
or slippers in hot sun?

1626
02:02:02,814 --> 02:02:04,452
When I fell exhausted with hunger,

1627
02:02:04,682 --> 02:02:08,391
they gave me a bun
and stone to beat! I beat!

1628
02:02:09,587 --> 02:02:12,227
Since that day I started beating
others for a living.

1629
02:02:13,024 --> 02:02:15,470
Nobody told me this is wrong, Anjali.

1630
02:02:15,693 --> 02:02:17,798
Not one!
What can I do?

1631
02:02:20,298 --> 02:02:22,938
<i>Till</i> you entered my life
I never knew two things in life,

1632
02:02:23,368 --> 02:02:25,814
one is love and
another is lying!

1633
02:02:26,437 --> 02:02:29,577
Though I lied for your love,
I don't feel it's wrong.

1634
02:02:31,709 --> 02:02:35,247
You didn't have anyone then,
but I'm there for you now.

1635
02:02:36,314 --> 02:02:38,260
Will you give up that life for me?

1636
02:02:38,516 --> 02:02:39,756
I've given it up.

1637
02:02:39,951 --> 02:02:41,828
From this moment I've given it up.

1638
02:02:42,053 --> 02:02:44,590
I want you.
I want your love.

1639
02:03:14,319 --> 02:03:18,631
Shankar, Nanaii killed my son.

1640
02:03:19,424 --> 02:03:24,874
He mustn't live.
He mustn't live! Kill him!

1641
02:03:25,096 --> 02:03:26,871
What's wrong in that?

1642
02:03:27,765 --> 02:03:31,303
If he had spared him,
I would've killed him.

1643
02:03:32,370 --> 02:03:34,475
What are you saying?

1644
02:03:34,672 --> 02:03:39,485
Poorna, I don't have any connection
with you or your gang from now.

1645
02:03:39,777 --> 02:03:41,484
I'm giving up life of violence.

1646
02:03:41,913 --> 02:03:43,654
Look after the business yourself.

1647
02:03:55,360 --> 02:03:59,502
I gave up only life of violence
not my arrogance.

1648
02:03:59,731 --> 02:04:01,506
Don't stir it.

1649
02:04:08,806 --> 02:04:11,377
Call Nanaji on phone,

1650
02:04:11,609 --> 02:04:17,924
Shankar gave up rowdyism for Anjali.

1651
02:04:18,750 --> 02:04:20,354
Call him!

1652
02:04:20,551 --> 02:04:21,928
If he had given her...

1653
02:04:25,757 --> 02:04:33,608
I'll feel sad for a week
when you killed my son,

1654
02:04:33,831 --> 02:04:35,538
or may be a month,

1655
02:04:36,501 --> 02:04:39,880
but if you hear
what I'm going to tell now,

1656
02:04:40,071 --> 02:04:42,881
you'll feel sad all your life!

1657
02:04:43,107 --> 02:04:44,085
What's it?

1658
02:04:44,409 --> 02:04:47,879
I've made Shankar who gave you sleepless
nights

1659
02:04:48,079 --> 02:04:50,059
to enter your daughter's life.

1660
02:04:50,448 --> 02:04:52,428
She loves him dearly.

1661
02:04:52,650 --> 02:04:54,891
What are you saying?

1662
02:04:55,119 --> 02:04:58,726
Your daughter won't believe
if you tell this is my plan.

1663
02:05:01,192 --> 02:05:03,729
I've another breaking news for you!

1664
02:05:03,995 --> 02:05:07,067
Shankar is eloping with
your daughter.

1665
02:05:07,532 --> 02:05:09,739
If you've guts, stop them!

1666
02:05:24,015 --> 02:05:26,427
Will your father agree?
- He'll surely agree.

1667
02:05:27,618 --> 02:05:30,758
I'm my father's life.
- Is it? Let's see!

1668
02:05:42,900 --> 02:05:44,777
Kill Shankar, boys!

1669
02:05:49,140 --> 02:05:50,619
Please listen to me.

1670
02:06:02,487 --> 02:06:04,967
They're attacking Shankar, kill them!

1671
02:06:22,607 --> 02:06:25,520
Father...father...no...
please listen to me.- Please move away.

1672
02:06:25,743 --> 02:06:27,051
Father!

1673
02:06:29,614 --> 02:06:32,993
Father, please listen to me...

1674
02:06:35,019 --> 02:06:36,828
Father!...

1675
02:06:56,974 --> 02:07:01,013
Nothing will happen to you, Anjali!

1676
02:07:15,126 --> 02:07:20,769
We've reached,
nothing will happen to you.

1677
02:07:39,250 --> 02:07:43,062
Anjali is calling you.
You too!

1678
02:07:54,699 --> 02:07:57,737
Doctor told me, you'll be fine.

1679
02:08:00,037 --> 02:08:01,744
I'm also a doctor, dad.

1680
02:08:02,273 --> 02:08:05,254
I don't have much time.
- Please don't say like that, dear.

1681
02:08:05,843 --> 02:08:06,913
Did you see, father?

1682
02:08:07,778 --> 02:08:10,088
How difficult it is to give life?

1683
02:08:10,281 --> 02:08:12,921
But you take lives very easily.

1684
02:08:14,051 --> 02:08:18,158
I had asked you manytimes,
but you never listened to me.

1685
02:08:18,389 --> 02:08:22,929
I asked Ravi only once,
he gave up everything for my sake.

1686
02:08:26,063 --> 02:08:28,304
We love each other, father.

1687
02:08:28,733 --> 02:08:30,770
We were coming to you only.

1688
02:08:31,302 --> 02:08:32,940
But you didn't listen to me.

1689
02:08:36,407 --> 02:08:37,852
Ravi has nobody in this world.

1690
02:08:39,076 --> 02:08:44,856
I'm the only person he had
in this world.

1691
02:08:45,082 --> 02:08:47,289
Now, I'm also leaving him.

1692
02:08:47,818 --> 02:08:49,798
Where will you go?
Nothing will happen to you.

1693
02:08:49,987 --> 02:08:51,625
Please allow me to talk, Ravi.

1694
02:08:52,223 --> 02:08:56,194
Ravi and I imagined
a new world for us,

1695
02:08:56,427 --> 02:08:58,134
I won't be there now,

1696
02:08:58,362 --> 02:08:59,807
but you must be there with him,

1697
02:09:01,832 --> 02:09:04,142
Ravi mustn't become
an orphan again, father.

1698
02:09:04,835 --> 02:09:06,212
You must become everything to him.

1699
02:09:06,671 --> 02:09:08,981
Father, mother and everything!

1700
02:09:12,910 --> 02:09:16,221
You must find a good girl for him
and arrange his marriage.

1701
02:09:16,447 --> 02:09:17,892
Is it necessary to tell that, Anjali?

1702
02:09:18,115 --> 02:09:20,891
It is necessary.
Please let me finish it.

1703
02:09:21,118 --> 02:09:23,997
My father too doesn't have anyone.
Except me!

1704
02:09:24,255 --> 02:09:25,700
I wanted to become a good doctor

1705
02:09:25,923 --> 02:09:30,167
and take away my father to
some place and look after him well,

1706
02:09:34,932 --> 02:09:36,843
you both must promise me,

1707
02:09:40,371 --> 02:09:46,344
start a new life elsewhere
giving up violent life.

1708
02:09:48,813 --> 02:09:53,853
When ever you think about me,
you must smile not feel sad.

1709
02:09:54,819 --> 02:09:58,357
Because I'll be there in your smile!

1710
02:10:00,491 --> 02:10:02,368
You'll let me stay with you, right?

1711
02:10:05,162 --> 02:10:07,870
I'll do as you say!

1712
02:10:08,833 --> 02:10:10,710
You marry Ravi!

1713
02:10:10,968 --> 02:10:13,881
But please don't leave me...

1714
02:10:59,784 --> 02:11:00,762
We'll take leave.

1715
02:11:02,219 --> 02:11:06,429
Understood life is living with
loved ones after losing Anjali.

1716
02:11:07,892 --> 02:11:14,332
Quit this life and
live elsewhere happily. Com e.

1717
02:11:24,241 --> 02:11:27,347
Even if brother quits,
he won't leave him.

1718
02:11:27,812 --> 02:11:31,453
To make their lives peaceful,
we've to do one thing.

1719
02:11:32,516 --> 02:11:36,293
From today, we must become
Nanaji and Shankar!

1720
02:11:38,389 --> 02:11:40,460
Let's divert Poorna's attention.

1721
02:12:37,214 --> 02:12:38,090
What happened?

1722
02:12:38,315 --> 02:12:41,558
It seems they're forcibly
marrying off Shruthi.

1723
02:12:41,986 --> 02:12:46,435
I tried all my influence but
nobody is taking a complaint also.

1724
02:12:46,657 --> 02:12:50,366
He says he won't leave Shruthi
until you come there.

1725
02:12:50,561 --> 02:12:52,905
I don't know what's the
enmity between you both?

1726
02:12:53,130 --> 02:12:56,043
But my daughter is getting
sacrificed for it.

1727
02:12:56,233 --> 02:12:59,214
Please save my daughter.

1728
02:13:01,939 --> 02:13:05,887
Father!- I heard everything.
You go!- Father!

1729
02:13:07,278 --> 02:13:09,383
I lost a daughter
because of my emotion,

1730
02:13:09,580 --> 02:13:12,117
I don't want to lose another
daughter because of your delay.

1731
02:13:12,349 --> 02:13:14,920
Anjali's last wish was also this.
Go!

1732
02:13:15,152 --> 02:13:16,130
Father, leaving you in this condition...

1733
02:13:16,353 --> 02:13:18,128
Will you go or
shall I go myself?

1734
02:13:19,924 --> 02:13:22,404
I'll go.
- Go!

1735
02:13:29,166 --> 02:13:32,909
Shocking news to make you go crazy!
- What's that?

1736
02:13:33,604 --> 02:13:35,413
Shankar is coming back to city!

1737
02:13:35,606 --> 02:13:38,086
Poorna's front and back
would get smashed!

1738
02:13:38,275 --> 02:13:41,256
So, have it full and
take good stock.

1739
02:13:42,947 --> 02:13:44,290
Shankar is coming back to city!

1740
02:13:44,515 --> 02:13:46,426
Is Shankar coming back?
- Come...come...

1741
02:13:46,617 --> 02:13:50,497
Why are you opening shops?
Shankar is coming.

1742
02:13:50,721 --> 02:13:53,600
He'll break the back of Poorna.

1743
02:13:54,391 --> 02:14:00,501
Who are you? Is this road yours?
Get down! Get down!

1744
02:14:00,731 --> 02:14:02,301
Who are you?

1745
02:14:02,533 --> 02:14:05,514
Do you know this?
Shankar is coming to city!

1746
02:14:05,736 --> 02:14:08,114
He'll blow up Poorna!

1747
02:14:12,977 --> 02:14:16,186
I told this to so many people,
nobody beat me.

1748
02:14:16,413 --> 02:14:18,984
You beat me that means
you're Poorna!

1749
02:14:19,216 --> 02:14:20,661
I found the man to get beaten up!

1750
02:14:21,085 --> 02:14:22,962
I've to meet the man
who would beat you!

1751
02:14:23,420 --> 02:14:28,335
Let's see who would beat whom!
Who would get beaten up?

1752
02:14:28,559 --> 02:14:30,129
Throw him into the vehicle.

1753
02:14:30,327 --> 02:14:33,467
Throw me, he'll blow you up!

1754
02:14:38,102 --> 02:14:40,139
Shankar may enter from any side!

1755
02:14:40,371 --> 02:14:43,215
Kill him as soon as he enters, boys!

1756
02:14:43,440 --> 02:14:46,319
I know very well about him,
he'll enter from any side.

1757
02:14:56,787 --> 02:14:58,232
Your entry is sensational, brother!

1758
02:15:12,469 --> 02:15:14,005
Something is happening!

1759
02:15:36,160 --> 02:15:40,700
Father...it's me!
Your Kasi!

1760
02:15:41,098 --> 02:15:43,271
Kasi?
- Kasi?

1761
02:15:43,500 --> 02:15:44,604
How can Shankar become Kasi?

1762
02:15:45,069 --> 02:15:47,549
Are you playing drama?
I'll kill you.

1763
02:15:47,771 --> 02:15:50,752
Will you kill the dead again, father?

1764
02:15:51,175 --> 02:15:53,712
Brother, he's cheating us by talking
and behaving like Kasi.

1765
02:15:54,111 --> 02:15:55,385
I'll kill him!

1766
02:15:56,513 --> 02:15:58,220
You wanted to build a house,

1767
02:15:58,449 --> 02:16:01,089
I gave you Rs.5 lakhs
without father's knowledge,

1768
02:16:01,318 --> 02:16:03,298
have you forgotten it, Fish?

1769
02:16:03,520 --> 02:16:06,091
Junior boss!
Brother, he's junior boss.

1770
02:16:06,323 --> 02:16:09,770
Only I and junior boss know
about this Rs.5 lakhs.

1771
02:16:10,194 --> 02:16:13,232
Jingle sir, please forgive me.

1772
02:16:13,797 --> 02:16:20,237
Has our Kasi's soul
entered Shankar's body?- Yes, father!

1773
02:16:20,471 --> 02:16:23,577
Nanaii, who was responsible
for elder brother's death,

1774
02:16:23,774 --> 02:16:26,448
I'll use Shankar's body
to kill him,

1775
02:16:26,677 --> 02:16:30,318
and body of Shankar,
who was responsible for my death,

1776
02:16:30,547 --> 02:16:33,460
I'll burn him alive!

1777
02:16:34,685 --> 02:16:37,131
Junior boss!
Are you doing all this alone?

1778
02:16:37,354 --> 02:16:38,458
Is your brother helping you?

1779
02:16:38,689 --> 02:16:43,331
He has forgotten all this
and is after women ghosts.

1780
02:16:43,560 --> 02:16:45,130
You must reform him, junior boss.

1781
02:16:45,362 --> 02:16:47,603
Shut up! He himself is
a ghost hanging in air.

1782
02:16:47,798 --> 02:16:49,436
How can he reform him?

1783
02:16:49,800 --> 02:16:52,280
How can you believe in ghosts, Poorna?

1784
02:16:52,469 --> 02:16:55,348
Call a Psychiatrist,
he'll reveal everything.

1785
02:16:56,140 --> 02:16:58,620
Call the doctor.

1786
02:17:03,814 --> 02:17:06,624
Who is the patient? Is it you?

1787
02:17:06,817 --> 02:17:10,128
You? Is he the mental patient?
- No! He's there!

1788
02:17:14,491 --> 02:17:17,165
He? He plays games too many!

1789
02:17:17,394 --> 02:17:18,634
I too have the same doubt.

1790
02:17:18,862 --> 02:17:22,173
But he's talking exactly
like my son. I'm confused.

1791
02:17:22,399 --> 02:17:24,845
Give me 5 minutes,

1792
02:17:25,269 --> 02:17:28,307
I'll decide if he's your son
or a cheat!

1793
02:17:33,177 --> 02:17:34,383
Hey tuft, go back.

1794
02:17:34,611 --> 02:17:36,488
You only, move away.
- Okay, brother.

1795
02:17:36,847 --> 02:17:38,383
Your name.
- Kasi.

1796
02:17:38,615 --> 02:17:42,324
Place near Varanasi?
- My name is Kasi.

1797
02:17:43,287 --> 02:17:48,737
Why did you come?
- To kill Shankar and Nanaii!

1798
02:17:48,959 --> 02:17:49,664
Let's come to the matter.

1799
02:17:49,893 --> 02:17:51,395
If you want to kill him,
you should go to him,

1800
02:17:51,628 --> 02:17:52,834
why did you come here?

1801
02:17:53,197 --> 02:17:54,733
This is right question.
Answer him.

1802
02:17:54,965 --> 02:17:58,412
Can you go to America
without visa?

1803
02:18:01,205 --> 02:18:05,676
We don't have permits to cross
boundaries, I mean no visa.

1804
02:18:05,876 --> 02:18:09,847
I was hanging on that tree
waiting for Shankar.

1805
02:18:11,982 --> 02:18:16,522
Where's Jingle sir?
- Jingle sir is not there.

1806
02:18:17,454 --> 02:18:20,867
Brother, I'm sure he's our Jingle sir.

1807
02:18:31,335 --> 02:18:33,906
Father...- He vanished there and
is coming from inside.

1808
02:18:34,338 --> 02:18:36,375
There's a soul in him.

1809
02:18:37,808 --> 02:18:38,718
Father!

1810
02:18:46,016 --> 02:18:50,396
How can you believe ghosts and
possession in modern science period?

1811
02:18:50,687 --> 02:18:54,464
You watch ghost films like
Arundhati, Kanchana, Prema Kadha Chitram,

1812
02:18:54,691 --> 02:18:56,227
Can't you understand
if you see it live?

1813
02:18:56,426 --> 02:18:57,404
Won't you believe it?

1814
02:19:01,698 --> 02:19:02,802
Look after the patient carefully.

1815
02:19:03,267 --> 02:19:05,804
Doctor, stay here fill
Jingle's soul leaves him.

1816
02:19:06,270 --> 02:19:08,409
Yes, stay here only.

1817
02:19:09,840 --> 02:19:12,821
Kasi, you take rest.

1818
02:19:13,277 --> 02:19:15,757
Okay, father!
Doctor, you come.

1819
02:19:17,981 --> 02:19:19,585
Where are you going?

1820
02:19:24,054 --> 02:19:26,500
You're multi talented!
- My foot!

1821
02:19:26,723 --> 02:19:28,930
I know you're not possessed
by any soul.

1822
02:19:29,459 --> 02:19:31,439
Why did you still support me then?

1823
02:19:31,662 --> 02:19:35,838
You've the capacity to bash them
in 10 minutes and take the girl.

1824
02:19:36,400 --> 02:19:39,779
But you're keeping the promise
you gave to Anjali, I like that.

1825
02:19:39,970 --> 02:19:41,278
Continue this!

1826
02:19:41,538 --> 02:19:44,451
That short man is listening us,
please see him.

1827
02:19:47,644 --> 02:19:48,782
Hey Pulka!
- Pulka?

1828
02:19:49,012 --> 02:19:50,514
Heard everything?
- I mean you are...

1829
02:19:50,747 --> 02:19:51,782
I'm Shankar!

1830
02:19:52,015 --> 02:19:54,996
Soul?
- My foot soul!

1831
02:19:55,419 --> 02:19:56,625
Foolish Pulka!

1832
02:20:07,998 --> 02:20:08,976
Have you come, Ravi?

1833
02:20:11,101 --> 02:20:13,012
I want to tell you something.

1834
02:20:13,437 --> 02:20:15,678
My name is not Ravi as you think.

1835
02:20:15,906 --> 02:20:17,817
Actually what had happened was...
- I know!

1836
02:20:18,008 --> 02:20:20,887
I came to know you and
your past here.

1837
02:20:21,111 --> 02:20:22,021
You're finished!

1838
02:20:22,446 --> 02:20:25,325
I know how much you loved Anjali.

1839
02:20:25,782 --> 02:20:28,661
I know how it would be if you love!

1840
02:20:29,519 --> 02:20:32,898
I can wait a life time
for your love.

1841
02:20:40,063 --> 02:20:41,701
You got trapped in the fight
between us.

1842
02:20:41,932 --> 02:20:44,708
I came here to take you.
That's why this drama,

1843
02:20:44,935 --> 02:20:47,506
I'll surely take you with me.
You don't worry.

1844
02:20:47,804 --> 02:20:53,720
You cheat Shankar!
Did you hear how he fooled us?

1845
02:20:53,944 --> 02:20:57,585
He says soul and
this man says Jingle sir!

1846
02:20:57,814 --> 02:20:59,851
He's finished.

1847
02:21:11,428 --> 02:21:12,532
Stop g

1848
02:21:13,630 --> 02:21:16,543
I heard everything
you told the girl.

1849
02:21:16,833 --> 02:21:18,608
I heard everything!

1850
02:21:20,637 --> 02:21:23,083
Has Kasi left your body?
- He won't!

1851
02:21:23,507 --> 02:21:25,384
But you told the girl?
- I lied!

1852
02:21:25,642 --> 02:21:27,622
Why did you lie?
- To use!

1853
02:21:28,111 --> 02:21:29,886
Use...
- Uncle...

1854
02:21:30,080 --> 02:21:32,560
She's Shankar's lover.

1855
02:21:33,116 --> 02:21:36,393
I'll not leave her or them!

1856
02:21:37,587 --> 02:21:40,898
It you give me way, I'll go.

1857
02:21:56,440 --> 02:21:57,976
You and you dirty doubts!

1858
02:21:58,208 --> 02:22:00,449
Unnecessarily I suspected
my son because of you.

1859
02:22:00,677 --> 02:22:02,418
I would've killed him!

1860
02:22:02,879 --> 02:22:04,916
Kill the dead again?

1861
02:22:10,620 --> 02:22:13,999
We'll take care of them later,
he says he'll use Shruthi, uncle!

1862
02:22:14,458 --> 02:22:16,802
Let him, he's just a soul!

1863
02:22:17,027 --> 02:22:20,873
Soul? You fool! He's using you!
He's playing with her.

1864
02:22:39,483 --> 02:22:41,156
25 year old beauty...
fish eyed beauty...

1865
02:22:41,585 --> 02:22:44,122
She's killing me with her eyes...

1866
02:22:48,525 --> 02:22:50,505
She's rocking...
she's sensational...

1867
02:22:50,727 --> 02:22:53,469
She's making me go crazy...

1868
02:22:57,734 --> 02:23:01,978
Hey boy, don't act as
if you don't know anything...

1869
02:23:02,172 --> 02:23:06,643
There's no mistake to go
bonkers instantly on sight...

1870
02:23:06,843 --> 02:23:08,720
Like an ant bite, like a sunstroke...

1871
02:23:08,945 --> 02:23:11,186
like a landmine blast, kiss me...

1872
02:23:11,615 --> 02:23:13,822
Come...come...com e...

1873
02:24:03,900 --> 02:24:05,777
Hey girl without seeing you...

1874
02:24:06,002 --> 02:24:08,243
Hide behind my sari end silently...

1875
02:24:08,672 --> 02:24:10,242
Without even letting air
between us...

1876
02:24:10,674 --> 02:24:12,779
I'll hug you like a pillow...

1877
02:24:13,009 --> 02:24:15,046
May your parents be blessed...

1878
02:24:15,278 --> 02:24:17,258
My In-laws are Godly...

1879
02:24:17,681 --> 02:24:22,061
Let's tie the knot...
will you take the seven steps?

1880
02:24:22,252 --> 02:24:26,598
I'll take the rings funnily
from the depth of your heart...

1881
02:24:26,823 --> 02:24:31,272
Like a calfjumping...like a moon...
like a rainbow bending...

1882
02:24:31,695 --> 02:24:33,902
Come to me...

1883
02:25:14,738 --> 02:25:19,118
Oh Go, you wore a white sari!
- You missed my chiffon blouse...

1884
02:25:19,309 --> 02:25:23,780
Sport jasmine in hair...
- It'll keep us sleepless all night...

1885
02:25:24,014 --> 02:25:28,326
You're weightless like flowers...
- You take me to the bliss...

1886
02:25:28,752 --> 02:25:33,201
You're smooth like butter
with a black pearl...

1887
02:25:33,423 --> 02:25:37,200
You pounce with desire
and won't stop...

1888
02:25:37,661 --> 02:25:39,800
Like a flowers swaying...
like a honey comb disturbed..

1889
02:25:39,996 --> 02:25:44,809
Like spilled sugar...
like a tattoo...come to me...

1890
02:26:11,027 --> 02:26:13,234
Listen to me carefully.

1891
02:26:13,463 --> 02:26:14,840
We've kidnapped as we had planned.

1892
02:26:15,065 --> 02:26:18,012
I'll call you myself
watching position here.

1893
02:26:19,803 --> 02:26:23,046
Oh my God!
Have you kidnapped Shruthi?

1894
02:26:23,273 --> 02:26:25,378
My foot marriage!
No marriage!

1895
02:26:25,809 --> 02:26:28,688
No need of flowers, get out.
Go!

1896
02:26:30,480 --> 02:26:31,857
What happened now?

1897
02:26:32,082 --> 02:26:33,390
I told you many times.

1898
02:26:33,817 --> 02:26:34,921
That variation guy isn't your son.

1899
02:26:35,151 --> 02:26:37,188
Do you know what did he do now?
He has kidnapped Shruthi!

1900
02:26:37,721 --> 02:26:40,258
What the hell are you saying?
- Shruthi has been kidnapped.

1901
02:26:40,724 --> 02:26:43,864
Uncle!

1902
02:26:44,060 --> 02:26:45,198
What happened, uncle?

1903
02:26:46,896 --> 02:26:47,704
Is she kidnapped?

1904
02:26:48,064 --> 02:26:50,271
I mean Shankar...phone...kidnap..

1905
02:26:50,767 --> 02:26:52,041
She's here only, right?

1906
02:26:52,402 --> 02:26:55,212
This is what you call
kicking yourself! - Shut up!

1907
02:26:57,173 --> 02:26:58,743
Broth er. . .broth er...

1908
02:26:58,975 --> 02:27:01,285
Brother...Rohit is missing!
- Missing?

1909
02:27:01,845 --> 02:27:04,382
What a twist you gave!

1910
02:27:17,861 --> 02:27:21,434
Not only you, I'm also clever.
Your nephew is with me.

1911
02:27:21,865 --> 02:27:23,742
Come with Shruthi
to harbour godown.

1912
02:27:25,869 --> 02:27:30,909
Father! Has Nanaii entered the city?
I'll kill him.

1913
02:27:31,107 --> 02:27:33,781
Even if there's a little
scratch on Rohit,

1914
02:27:34,010 --> 02:27:37,116
beast in me would come out in open!

1915
02:27:37,347 --> 02:27:39,327
He'll hack down everyone.

1916
02:27:39,816 --> 02:27:42,990
I'll take bath with his blood!

1917
02:27:43,219 --> 02:27:45,130
What an act!

1918
02:27:45,355 --> 02:27:47,926
You'll get Oscar award in courier!

1919
02:28:18,254 --> 02:28:21,133
Point a knife, he may suspect you.

1920
02:28:22,826 --> 02:28:24,305
Start it.

1921
02:28:24,928 --> 02:28:30,310
If you want your nephew alive,
send Shruthi and Shankar to me.

1922
02:28:31,835 --> 02:28:33,041
Watch now, what would he say!

1923
02:28:33,269 --> 02:28:38,184
Father, I'll take her to Nanaii
and kill him!

1924
02:28:38,408 --> 02:28:39,512
He'll say that!

1925
02:28:39,943 --> 02:28:45,325
Father, I'll take her to Nanaii
and kill him!

1926
02:28:46,282 --> 02:28:50,321
Go! I've been waiting
years for this!

1927
02:28:50,954 --> 02:28:56,336
Nanaii, I'm sending both of them.
Send Rohit!

1928
02:28:58,962 --> 02:28:59,838
Take her.

1929
02:29:04,200 --> 02:29:07,340
Rohit is coming here,
it means marriage is over.

1930
02:29:07,971 --> 02:29:09,416
Bride is going that side,
groom is coming this side,

1931
02:29:09,873 --> 02:29:11,011
how can they marry man?

1932
02:29:19,983 --> 02:29:26,423
Junior boss, kill him!
Kill him,Junior boss!

1933
02:29:26,656 --> 02:29:28,363
Shall I kill him?

1934
02:29:29,058 --> 02:29:30,366
Shall I?

1935
02:29:31,127 --> 02:29:35,576
You fools! He's not your junior boss.
He's Shankar!

1936
02:29:35,999 --> 02:29:36,909
You're clean bowled!

1937
02:29:37,133 --> 02:29:41,548
You said Jingle sir,
look how they'll enjoy now.

1938
02:29:53,349 --> 02:29:55,226
What a twist you gave, brother!

1939
02:29:59,022 --> 02:30:00,057
Shankar cheated us!

1940
02:30:00,290 --> 02:30:02,270
Did you understand now,
you duffers!

1941
02:30:02,492 --> 02:30:04,062
I was warning you from the beginning.

1942
02:30:04,260 --> 02:30:07,070
He's not your son but a cheat.
You fools!

1943
02:30:07,297 --> 02:30:10,471
You boasted about killing him.
What the hell could you do?

1944
02:30:10,700 --> 02:30:12,907
Is he a villain with henchmen too?

1945
02:30:13,169 --> 02:30:14,147
Shut up!

1946
02:30:14,370 --> 02:30:18,910
Never dare to touch fire
or angry Crazy!

1947
02:30:19,108 --> 02:30:20,086
You'll get burnt!

1948
02:30:20,276 --> 02:30:22,415
What is he saying?
- No more words!

1949
02:30:22,612 --> 02:30:24,250
No more discussions!

1950
02:30:35,525 --> 02:30:42,636
I too belong to your party sir,
I joined him for fun!

1951
02:30:43,066 --> 02:30:44,170
Please forgive me, sir.

1952
02:30:44,400 --> 02:30:47,176
I'm your uncle, right Shruthi?

1953
02:30:47,403 --> 02:30:51,613
Please tell them to admit me
in their party.- Okay, uncle.

1954
02:30:52,308 --> 02:30:53,286
Okay, Pulka.

1955
02:30:54,410 --> 02:30:58,119
Your dance earlier was very good,
why not do it again for me?

1956
02:30:58,748 --> 02:31:00,455
I want to see his reaction.

1957
02:31:38,454 --> 02:31:43,494
Do I look like an idiot to
believe your silly dram a?

1958
02:31:43,693 --> 02:31:47,231
The game is yours
but the goal is mine!

1959
02:31:48,031 --> 02:31:52,673
Not one of them must go
out alive from here.

1960
02:31:53,703 --> 02:31:54,511
I didn't want anyone to die
for the promise I gave,

1961
02:31:54,704 --> 02:32:01,588
if I start to kill again,
you'll be the first victim!

1962
02:32:01,811 --> 02:32:02,721
You said it right, Shankar.

1963
02:32:03,146 --> 02:32:05,592
It's not enough if we both
say no to violence.

1964
02:32:05,815 --> 02:32:08,193
Violence must leave Vizag!

1965
02:32:08,418 --> 02:32:11,695
If that has to happen,
he's the only one remaining. Go!

1966
02:32:12,055 --> 02:32:12,726
You wait!

1967
02:32:13,156 --> 02:32:16,535
I know him and his capacity.
Play with them, son!

1968
02:32:52,762 --> 02:32:55,641
Where shall I fix the marriage?
Here or Bangalore?

1969
02:32:55,865 --> 02:32:56,434
Ravi...

1970
02:32:56,666 --> 02:32:58,577
Forget about that.
Tell me where?

1971
02:32:58,768 --> 02:33:00,076
As you wish, father-in-law.

1972
02:33:56,159 --> 02:33:58,139
When I killed your son, you came,

1973
02:33:58,327 --> 02:33:59,829
if I kill you,who will come?

1974
02:34:00,263 --> 02:34:04,302
Nobody will come.
Quit rowdyism. Quit!

1975
02:34:11,407 --> 02:34:17,483
I'm telling you again,
I quit violence only not my arrogance.

1976
02:34:24,620 --> 02:34:27,191
Anyway you got back Shruthi!

1977
02:34:27,423 --> 02:34:28,663
You're not an ordinary man.

1978
02:34:29,625 --> 02:34:31,502
Come to the position, please.
- No, I won't.

1979
02:34:32,428 --> 02:34:35,409
Who is that?
- I'm your biggest fan!

1980
02:34:35,631 --> 02:34:38,840
Expected action but
you gave full entertainment.

1981
02:34:39,635 --> 02:34:41,171
That's great!
