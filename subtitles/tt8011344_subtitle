1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,875


3
00:04:37,167 --> 00:04:38,417
To better this world...

4
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,125
Who so ever it may be,
he'll shatter him...

5
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:48,958
Even if it's God of Death,
he'll shatter him also...

6
00:04:49,167 --> 00:04:51,833
No one on earth can take on him...

7
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:00,875
No one can dare compete with him...

8
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,625
No one to defeat him here...

9
00:05:02,792 --> 00:05:05,292
He's one of a kind...
He's Sivan...

10
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,708
What's just here?
What's justice here?

11
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:16,167
Whatever your soul says is justice...

12
00:05:23,167 --> 00:05:26,375
Demon...Demon...Demon...

13
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:29,750
He's on prowl and hunt
day in and day out...

14
00:05:29,917 --> 00:05:32,583
He destroys everything
and everyone...

15
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:18,583
Oh!

16
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:21,292
What's this?
They've cut open this also!

17
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:28,292
Hey, our box is missing!

18
00:06:31,292 --> 00:06:32,333
Headlines

19
00:06:32,542 --> 00:06:38,458
Bank cash Rs.5.75 crores brought
from Mysore in a train has been stolen.

20
00:06:38,667 --> 00:06:43,083
The incident in which roof of the train
has been cut open to rob cash,

21
00:06:43,292 --> 00:06:47,667
it has shocked bank authorities
and general public.

22
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:50,375
Don't know who gave you
information so quickly,

23
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:51,708
understand this very well,

24
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:54,750
RBI never distributes cash
to anyone directly.

25
00:06:54,917 --> 00:06:58,458
It reaches general public
through banks only.

26
00:06:58,667 --> 00:07:03,333
All the currency now stolen
is new notes printed in Mysore.

27
00:07:03,542 --> 00:07:06,042
Stealing RBI money is
grave criminal offence.

28
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,042
Definitely we're going
to take legal action on this.

29
00:07:14,792 --> 00:07:16,292
Didn't get into any trouble,
right Jagan?

30
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,208
Forget about me getting caught,
if you were caught for what you did,

31
00:07:19,417 --> 00:07:20,375
they would've thrashed
you black and blue.

32
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:21,708
Despite my warnings,

33
00:07:21,917 --> 00:07:24,000
why do you always take risk
to put my life in danger?

34
00:07:25,042 --> 00:07:25,792
Okay, go.

35
00:07:36,917 --> 00:07:38,542
Kerala

36
00:07:41,292 --> 00:07:43,083
Hello, sir.
- Mr.Manickavasagam.

37
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,292
Where are you now?
Are you busy?

38
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,333
Can I talk to you now?

39
00:07:46,542 --> 00:07:48,250
No sir, I'm not,
please go ahead, sir.

40
00:07:48,417 --> 00:07:50,750
Your resignation letter is on my table.

41
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:53,250
I've kept it in pending
without forwarding it.

42
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,083
Sir, may I know why?

43
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,250
You've to complete a major operation.

44
00:07:57,417 --> 00:07:59,667
I decide about your letter after that.

45
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:03,500
My daughter is feeling very lonely
without her mother, sir.

46
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,375
I managed to convince her to
come with me to another place.

47
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:08,792
Finish the case and take leave,
you can leave your child in my home.

48
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,958
I'll take care of your daughter
like my own granddaughter.

49
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:12,917
Sir...

50
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,125
Hope you'll listen to me.

51
00:08:14,292 --> 00:08:15,917
Okay, sir...I'll be there.

52
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,250
Loan Available
10% Interest

53
00:08:24,917 --> 00:08:25,792
This guy?

54
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,875
Don't know whose bike he has stolen?
- Get me a hot tea boiling like acid.

55
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,375
My tea is like that only.

56
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:31,792
Hands off that bonda.

57
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,542
Why?
- Asking me why?

58
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,250
Is it so honour to order tea for you?

59
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:39,708
You've eaten 200 biscuits.
Drank 201 teas!

60
00:08:39,917 --> 00:08:42,125
Pay for it and then dare touch
yesterday's bonda.

61
00:08:42,292 --> 00:08:44,875
Yes, would've spat 100 teas
and fed 105 biscuits to dogs.

62
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:48,167
I didn't talk about your friend Jagan,
pay my dues and then touch it.

63
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:51,125
Okay, I'll take one bonda.
- Hey, look these photos, dare touch now.

64
00:08:51,292 --> 00:08:53,000
Dare touch bonda after
looking at those men of integrity.

65
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:54,833
Why should I see his face
to take a bonda?

66
00:08:55,042 --> 00:08:56,083
Then, give my your aadhar card.

67
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,375
Will you ask aadhar card for a bonda?

68
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:58,583
Ask all these questions with me.

69
00:08:58,792 --> 00:08:59,917
You give all other without
asking questions, right?

70
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,875
Give me.- Hey!
- Who is that?

71
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,750
Stop the bonda!
- I know that's a dummy note.

72
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:08,750
Hey you chimpanzee,
keep this pink note.

73
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:11,208
Repay India's loan,
prepare 2 special tea.

74
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:12,750
If I drink, I mustn't throw up.
Must be that good.

75
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:14,292
Don't know from which
share auto driver he stole it!

76
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,167
Says he's police man.
- What's all this lousy things?

77
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:16,875
Don't you've gold biscuits?
- I'll ask bakery man to do it.

78
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:18,250
Don't say, do it.
- You shut your gob.

79
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:22,250
Why are you talking to this silly man?
- Sir, please don't demonetize this note also!

80
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:23,875
I got it after great struggle.
- If you want money, should've asked me.

81
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:26,292
I'll get salary in 2 days.
He's going overboard.

82
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,750
Why this urgency before
he gets his salary?

83
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,458
Are you going to act in ad films
with Tamanna and Hansika?

84
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:34,250
Don't unnecessarily drag
my leader into this, Jagan.

85
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:37,000
I owe money to my hairstylist
for 3 months.

86
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:40,667
Do you call a monkey a hairstylist
if it searches for lice?

87
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:41,583
Look, what a chimp is saying!

88
00:09:41,792 --> 00:09:43,917
Tea shops guys have
become troublesome.

89
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,458
To unearth sensational train robbery,

90
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:54,167
a special investigation team has been
formed under CBCID DSP Manickavasagam.

91
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:58,250
Additional Commissioner has said
this in a statement to the press.

92
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:02,875
He hoped the robbers would
be apprehended in near future.

93
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,458
Sakthi, come here.

94
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,083
Hey, come, give them this balance tea.

95
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,125
Go, man.

96
00:10:09,292 --> 00:10:10,875
Brother, tea.

97
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,917
I've been watching ever since
I joined police force.

98
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,292
He's very honest and dedicated.
A demon in his work.

99
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,708
When you show your talent,
be careful with him, okay?

100
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,250
I knew he would spit it.

101
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,250
You take money for it, right? - Yes.
- It is smelling like poison.

102
00:10:27,417 --> 00:10:30,667
What the hell is this then?
No sugar or no tea., yuck!

103
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Four people are having it,
can't you have it as fifth man?

104
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,792
Is he not alive after drinking my tea?
Come on, you have the tea.

105
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,083
Look at hi face like
an aadhar card photo.

106
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,083
Hey!

107
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,083
I'm telling him very important
company secret.

108
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,708
He's going away without caring about it.

109
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:47,792
Sir!

110
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:50,458
Ha! Come, Manickavasagam.

111
00:10:50,667 --> 00:10:53,375
What's this like a college student?
Beard and ear stud!

112
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:56,250
Have you decided that dept.
has accepted your resignation?

113
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:57,167
No, sir.

114
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,208
Please sit down.
- Thank you, sir.

115
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:06,167
One important meeting.
Don't send anyone inside.

116
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:11,667
You would've heard about
latest train robbery.

117
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:12,500
Yes, sir.

118
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:16,583
Till now RPF was handling this case,
it has been transferred to us,

119
00:11:16,792 --> 00:11:19,958
and you're going to handle the case.
- Sure, sir.

120
00:11:20,167 --> 00:11:22,708
And you know media
is watching it very keenly.

121
00:11:22,917 --> 00:11:26,083
Try to close this case
as quickly as possible.

122
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,458
Got it, sir.
- Okay. Now you may go.

123
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:29,458
Yes, sir.

124
00:11:30,042 --> 00:11:30,917
I'll take leave, sir.
- All the best.

125
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,042
Thank you, sir.

126
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,500
What's that?

127
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:09,250
Jagan!
- Sakthi!

128
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:11,792
What happened?
What happened to you?

129
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,792
Nothing, sir.

130
00:14:05,417 --> 00:14:06,792
Hey, come...come...

131
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,917
You look devastating!

132
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,042
Hey, look here!

133
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,500
You want more speed?
- Yes...yes.

134
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,917
Why the alarm is ringing?

135
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:11,292
Bloody, you're dead meat today!

136
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:16,042
How dare you steal my money!
Blood thief!

137
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,458
Go faster!

138
00:15:54,917 --> 00:15:56,708
Hey!

139
00:16:03,667 --> 00:16:04,583
Hey!

140
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:19,333
If you've been engaged as driver,
just be a driver only.

141
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:26,708
Why are you telling about Jamaluddin's
illegal money transfer business?

142
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:27,958
Tell me I say!

143
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:29,792
Father!
- What?

144
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,500
Malik is online, father.

145
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:37,667
What? Have you entered city border?

146
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:40,875
Father, someone stole money
on the way.

147
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,458
How? In which area?

148
00:16:42,667 --> 00:16:45,667
On the way to Vandalur
from Kelambakkam...

149
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:48,750
Instead of raising a useless son,
I should've killed you as an infant.

150
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:49,875
Kill him, boys.

151
00:17:12,042 --> 00:17:14,083
I want to see everyone
who was on duty that day.

152
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,000
Okay, sir.

153
00:17:19,292 --> 00:17:23,125
Did you stop the train anywhere
else other than stations?

154
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:27,083
No sir, didn't stop train anywhere.
Stopped in stations only.

155
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:31,000
Who opened the parcel wagon
after train reached this station?

156
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:32,083
I opened it, sir.

157
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:36,125
Did you find any evidence of
trying to break open the lock?

158
00:17:36,292 --> 00:17:38,458
No, sir.
There wasn't any damage to the lock.

159
00:17:38,667 --> 00:17:40,208
Lock was in perfect condition, sir.

160
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:44,750
Did you find the RBI cash box?
- No, sir.

161
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,417
Train which came from Mysore,

162
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:49,458
if you've to cut open
the train roof while running,

163
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:52,250
it is possible between Salem-Vridhachalam
where you don't have electric lines.

164
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:56,458
So, our squad has gone
there for initial inquiry, sir.

165
00:17:56,667 --> 00:17:59,667
Where are the other boxes which
came along with cash box?

166
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:02,250
Sir, it has been delivered.
- Delivered?- Yes, sir.

167
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,125
What was inside the parcel
while loading it,

168
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:08,958
and when the parcel is delivered
the condition of the parcel,

169
00:18:09,167 --> 00:18:11,583
do you've the CSO status report?
- No, sir.

170
00:18:11,792 --> 00:18:13,250
In a crime spot,

171
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:15,417
any object in close radius of it,

172
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:18,583
it must be in our custody till
level one investigation is over,

173
00:18:18,792 --> 00:18:23,208
or else we must have the complete
report of the object's cross section.

174
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:27,250
Because of guys like you,
other state people come here to rob.

175
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,042
Bloody imbeciles!

176
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,250
I don't know what or how you do it!

177
00:18:31,417 --> 00:18:35,750
Every object delivered must be here
along with receipt for my next inquiry.

178
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,167
It's my severe warning.

179
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:40,208
Got it? Be careful!
We'll finish you!

180
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:45,167
You know about him well, right?
Why did you give him that job?

181
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,750
When will he learn the trade
if he roams like a wastrel!

182
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:49,917
I thought he would gain experience
with small amounts.

183
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:52,708
Useless guy! He got cheated.

184
00:18:52,917 --> 00:18:54,083
What made you lose your concentration?

185
00:18:54,292 --> 00:18:56,208
For my trade, trust is most important.

186
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:58,333
I'm in this position on
that foundation only.

187
00:18:58,542 --> 00:19:01,417
Someone has planned
to break my trust and fear of me,

188
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:05,333
and ruin my illegal money
transfer business.

189
00:19:05,542 --> 00:19:10,000
The man who stole my money,
I want to find and burn him alive.

190
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:15,958
Karthik sir, I'm here trusting you.

191
00:19:16,917 --> 00:19:18,333
Diya, come in.

192
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,750
Diya, this is Mr.Jamaluddin
and his son Malik.

193
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:31,292
My long time client.

194
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:34,042
He comes to us if he faces any problem.

195
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,625
Now, a major issue.

196
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:40,333
Bhai, take it as your job is done.
Diya will handle your case.

197
00:19:40,542 --> 00:19:44,333
Karthik sir, when I started this business,
she wouldn't have been born.

198
00:19:44,542 --> 00:19:46,042
You're handing over my problem to her.

199
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,917
Don't play with my life to train her.

200
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:52,000
I've more faith in her ability
than myself.

201
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:55,792
Diya is the brain behind my agency
becoming number one in state.

202
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,583
Bhai, you'll understand her intelligence
when she closes the case.

203
00:19:59,792 --> 00:20:01,375
Okay, you carry on.

204
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:02,458
Yes, sir.

205
00:20:02,667 --> 00:20:07,458
He threw the box from moving train
to a distance of 20 meters.

206
00:20:07,667 --> 00:20:09,000
It must be weightless.

207
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,667
Moreover, seeing dents of the box,

208
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:14,792
I think they took money and
threw away empty box only.

209
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,042
Yes sir, may be.

210
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,583
So, the thief first took cash
personally to Chennai.

211
00:20:19,792 --> 00:20:24,500
Or else he would've transferred the cash
into another parcel in the same train.

212
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:27,375
And had taken delivery
of the parcel in Chennai.

213
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:28,667
There are just two chances.

214
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:31,292
Get complete details of
all the parcels in the coach.

215
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:34,000
And addresses of people who had
taken delivery of the same.

216
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,000
Okay, sir.
Super, sir.

217
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,083
The time you started,
the area where it was stolen,

218
00:20:41,292 --> 00:20:42,667
all the details are okay,

219
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:48,292
but I can't believe that a thief stole money
from boot when the car is running.

220
00:20:49,417 --> 00:20:50,875
I want to check your car.

221
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:53,417
When car was moving,
I heard sound from boot.

222
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:54,958
Before I could turn back to see
what had happened,

223
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,583
he took the bag and escaped.

224
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,875
Right here only.

225
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:19,583
Without a small scratch,
he managed to steal while moving.

226
00:21:20,167 --> 00:21:23,292
Really a great job!
- What? Great job?

227
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,958
I'm here with a complaint that
someone has stolen my money.

228
00:21:26,167 --> 00:21:28,958
Are you talking great
about that robber?

229
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:31,875
I can't stop myself from
praising his talent.

230
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,167
To open boot wide,

231
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:35,208
he used remote bomb,

232
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:38,958
and to stop alarm from setting off,
he set up a PC to fuse it off.

233
00:21:39,167 --> 00:21:41,167
But fuse plan failed.

234
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,583
So, your son knew about losing
his money there itself.

235
00:21:44,792 --> 00:21:47,542
Or else he would've known it
on reaching Chennai only.

236
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:52,167
Only a technically strong man
can plan such a heist.

237
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:56,167
Or else someone who is a robber
for many years can pull it off.

238
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:58,167
I don't think it was done
by your competitor.

239
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:02,458
Because if it was to finish your business
the plan would've been different.

240
00:22:02,667 --> 00:22:06,792
I think someone who doesn't know
anything about you has stolen it.

241
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:10,542
He hasn't left any traces.

242
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:14,000
I'm sure he'll be a big headache
to the department.

243
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,542
I don't know which route
I'll take to catch him,

244
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:20,292
but we'll catch him soon.

245
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:29,167
How come you're here, Diya?
- About a case.

246
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:30,583
Is it?

247
00:22:49,042 --> 00:22:51,542
Sir, checked all the addresses of
every parcel that had come in train, sir.

248
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,958
Every address is correct.
Except this one.

249
00:22:54,542 --> 00:22:55,292
Fake address.

250
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,542
Great escape, sir.

251
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,542
Check Egmore station CCTV footage.
- Okay, sir.

252
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,875
Right, okay.

253
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:15,333
Please Zoom In.

254
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:21,625
CCTV footage shows you
delivered the package.

255
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,458
Did you ever deliver package
like this earlier also?

256
00:23:23,667 --> 00:23:24,917
No, sir.

257
00:23:25,542 --> 00:23:26,250
How was he to look like?

258
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:30,208
He was wearing helmet
completely covering his face, sir.

259
00:23:31,792 --> 00:23:32,333
Sir...
- Tell me.

260
00:23:32,542 --> 00:23:34,125
Checked CCTV footage,

261
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:36,792
accused got package delivered
by porter and escaped, sir.

262
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,125
His bike number plate also fake, sir.

263
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:40,667
Inquired with porter also, sir.

264
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:42,333
They both don't have any connection, sir.

265
00:23:42,542 --> 00:23:45,542
Track the route taken by accused.
- Okay, sir.

266
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:51,042
What?
Searching money in a book?

267
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:53,375
Sir has gone out,
tell me, what's the matter?

268
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:55,042
What's the matter?

269
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:56,917
Did you meet me earlier or not?

270
00:23:57,125 --> 00:24:00,667
From the day I gave you my case,
even your make up hasn't faded.

271
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:03,792
Not a clue about my money
or the robber.

272
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,667
What the hell are you doing here?

273
00:24:06,958 --> 00:24:11,250
This is not a job of medium
to find robber easily.

274
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:13,167
Today you're talking about my make up.

275
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:16,708
You should've told me the truth
while handing over the case to me.

276
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:19,125
If not we've to work on
information we get.

277
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:21,875
That's what I'm asking you,
what information you got,

278
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:23,208
what the hell were you
doing all these days?

279
00:24:23,417 --> 00:24:26,042
Just two more days only,
if you don't find the thief,

280
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:27,500
I'll do it myself.

281
00:24:27,708 --> 00:24:29,542
Forget about setting time limit for us.

282
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:33,333
Your son who is standing
behind you and ogling at me,

283
00:24:33,542 --> 00:24:36,042
first ask him to tell the truth
without telling any lie.

284
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:38,208
If not you too can't do anything.

285
00:24:38,417 --> 00:24:40,708
Hey, tell her the truth.

286
00:24:40,917 --> 00:24:42,208
What should I tell her now?

287
00:24:42,417 --> 00:24:44,208
Uhh?

288
00:24:48,292 --> 00:24:50,833
Tell me, whose nail this is
that was found in your car?

289
00:24:52,417 --> 00:24:53,708
Oh no, I got caught.

290
00:24:56,417 --> 00:24:58,042
Come...come...come quickly.

291
00:24:58,208 --> 00:24:59,417
Quick...quick...

292
00:25:22,917 --> 00:25:24,833
Bloody bull! Move men!

293
00:25:25,042 --> 00:25:27,417
Hey wastrel! Go!

294
00:25:27,958 --> 00:25:28,667
Come on!

295
00:25:33,417 --> 00:25:34,583
Will you hit him before me also?

296
00:25:36,958 --> 00:25:40,833
Sir, we roaming near Washermanpet
flower market with counterfeit notes.

297
00:25:41,042 --> 00:25:42,667
So, I brought him here.
- If you tell us the truth,

298
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:43,875
the problem will end here with this.

299
00:25:44,083 --> 00:25:45,667
If not I'll arrest and
thrash you inside lock-up.

300
00:25:45,875 --> 00:25:46,958
What's his problem?

301
00:25:47,167 --> 00:25:49,667
Sir, I didn't commit any mistake.

302
00:25:49,875 --> 00:25:50,875
He doesn't have any problem, sir.

303
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:53,083
He punched to break driver's nose.

304
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:56,542
Inspector said he's your friend,
so I didn't file FIR on him.

305
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:59,542
The victim has got certificate
from hospital also.

306
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:02,458
Sir, please ensure he has no problems.

307
00:26:02,667 --> 00:26:04,167
We've done what we can.

308
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:05,667
Hereafter we've to face the problem.

309
00:26:05,875 --> 00:26:07,333
Let Inspector come,
inform and take him with you.

310
00:26:07,542 --> 00:26:08,875
If you accept the truth,
it's safe for you.

311
00:26:09,083 --> 00:26:10,208
I'm telling you the truth, sir.

312
00:26:10,375 --> 00:26:12,750
I don't know anything
about this note, sir.

313
00:26:12,958 --> 00:26:15,208
I got it from a flower seller
in Washermanpet.

314
00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:16,875
What were you dealing
with a flower seller?

315
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:17,708
Are you narrating story to me?

316
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:19,167
I'm telling you the truth, sir.

317
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:25,667
I mortgaged my house to take loan of
Rs.5 lakhs for my daughter's marriage.

318
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:31,875
I got caught while paying advance
for flowers as an auspicious start.

319
00:26:32,083 --> 00:26:34,625
Did you get Rs.1 lakh for Rs.50000
or Rs.2 lakhs for Rs.1 lakh?

320
00:26:34,833 --> 00:26:36,750
How much you doubled your money?
- Doubling?

321
00:26:36,958 --> 00:26:40,125
I don't know what's that, sir.
- Please take him inside.

322
00:26:40,292 --> 00:26:42,042
Please don't repeat the same lines.
- Sir!

323
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:44,083
What's the problem here?
- Doubling, sir.

324
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,542
Which area?
- Washermanpet flower market, sir.

325
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,042
Washermanpet? Flower market?

326
00:26:48,208 --> 00:26:49,875
Bloody idiots!

327
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:53,250
Ramanathan is doubling crores
without our knowledge.

328
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:57,042
You don't have the capacity to
arrest him and settle the matter.

329
00:26:57,208 --> 00:27:01,167
Are you creating a scene here
by inquiring an old man?

330
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:02,708
Send him away.

331
00:27:02,917 --> 00:27:04,167
Hey, come with us.

332
00:27:04,542 --> 00:27:06,708
What's up, Jagan?
- Hello, sir.

333
00:27:08,667 --> 00:27:09,750
Please take your seat.

334
00:27:14,292 --> 00:27:16,833
Who is he?
- My close friend, sir.

335
00:27:17,083 --> 00:27:19,333
First take him away from this area.

336
00:27:19,542 --> 00:27:20,875
Headache!

337
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:26,458
Call taxi drivers are threatening self
immolation if I don't take action on him.

338
00:27:26,667 --> 00:27:28,208
Please advice him properly, go.

339
00:27:28,417 --> 00:27:30,583
Sorry for the trouble, sir. Thanks.
- Okay.

340
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:33,875
Yes, I'm Inspector Chandru here.

341
00:27:38,833 --> 00:27:41,833
Washermanpet

342
00:28:02,667 --> 00:28:05,042
Hey, what's this?

343
00:28:05,208 --> 00:28:09,875
A beautiful girl in our area
like Hansika with Annachi.

344
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:12,875
Hey boy, come here.

345
00:28:14,667 --> 00:28:16,333
Tell me, sister.
What do you want, sister?

346
00:28:16,542 --> 00:28:17,625
Any help?

347
00:28:18,833 --> 00:28:21,500
Where's Navya's house?
- What? Navya?

348
00:28:21,708 --> 00:28:23,458
I was drooling thinking it was me.

349
00:28:23,667 --> 00:28:27,333
Forget him, sister.
I'll take you to Navya's house, sister.

350
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:33,333
Washermanpet Flower Market

351
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:44,042
Where's Ramanathan flower shop, madam?

352
00:28:44,208 --> 00:28:47,417
Look at the board there, next to it.
- Okay.

353
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,833
Hey, stop!

354
00:29:02,625 --> 00:29:04,708
Can't you see men standing here?
You're just walking in casually!

355
00:29:04,917 --> 00:29:05,542
What should I do now?

356
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:09,458
Whom do you want to meet?
- Your owner Ramanathan.

357
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:13,250
Sir, on checking CCTV footage,

358
00:29:13,458 --> 00:29:16,750
accused has gone towards Pudupet
after taking money from Egmore station.

359
00:29:16,958 --> 00:29:19,875
The bike never came out from Pudupet, sir.

360
00:29:20,083 --> 00:29:21,625
Who told you about me?

361
00:29:21,833 --> 00:29:25,958
You've a demand in market,
no need for any introduction.

362
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:31,958
Just like this a girl came here
knowing about me,

363
00:29:32,167 --> 00:29:33,708
I'm not exaggerating,

364
00:29:33,917 --> 00:29:36,583
she went on to devour so many men!

365
00:29:36,792 --> 00:29:39,542
Why are you still here, boy?
- Can I go then, sister?

366
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,458
Wait.

367
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,708
Take this, get cool drinks for us.

368
00:29:44,917 --> 00:29:47,333
If you want anything, buy it.

369
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,500
No urgency, come leisurely.
- Got it, I got it clearly, sister.

370
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:52,833
I'll come back taking time.

371
00:29:55,417 --> 00:29:56,208
Tell me, now.

372
00:29:56,417 --> 00:29:58,625
You were telling about that girl.

373
00:29:59,167 --> 00:30:00,208
Forget about her.

374
00:30:00,417 --> 00:30:01,417
Come in.

375
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,458
Is it first time for you?

376
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:23,208
No, if it is first time,
I'll act accordingly.

377
00:30:23,417 --> 00:30:24,417
That's why I asked you.

378
00:30:26,208 --> 00:30:28,000
How long you know Malik?

379
00:30:28,667 --> 00:30:30,958
You were with Malik entire
last week, right?

380
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:33,667
Whom did you tell about
Malik taking cash in his car?

381
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:36,375
Hey, who the hell are you?
Get out!

382
00:30:36,583 --> 00:30:38,875
How much you got paid for
leaking info about Malik's money,

383
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:41,750
I'll pay you thrice of that,
just tell me his name.

384
00:30:41,958 --> 00:30:44,250
How do I look like to you?

385
00:30:44,458 --> 00:30:46,625
I agree I'm a prostitute who sleeps
with different man every day.

386
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:51,292
But I don't have to steal or
betray someone's trust to make money.

387
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:56,208
If you've doubt come with me for a day.
I'm earning more than my needs.

388
00:30:56,417 --> 00:30:59,417
Okay, I agree whatever you say.

389
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:01,375
Can I check your phone?

390
00:31:01,583 --> 00:31:03,458
Still you don't trust me, right?

391
00:31:03,875 --> 00:31:08,458
Inquire yourself with whom I talked
on phone and slept with.

392
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:36,458
Thanks.

393
00:31:39,542 --> 00:31:41,167
I never had it before.

394
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:43,750
How will be your approach?
Please tell me.

395
00:31:45,083 --> 00:31:45,875
Hottie!

396
00:31:47,208 --> 00:31:47,875
Oh no!

397
00:31:52,292 --> 00:31:55,875
You look like new here!
Who sent you?- Raja!

398
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:58,417
Raja? Which Raja?

399
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:01,208
No, please.
It'll be problem if I tell.

400
00:32:01,417 --> 00:32:03,625
Hey, are you making fun of me?

401
00:32:03,833 --> 00:32:07,083
Can you do it or find another...?

402
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:08,458
How much?

403
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:11,125
Hey!
- Brother!

404
00:32:11,292 --> 00:32:12,667
Check the bag.

405
00:32:16,417 --> 00:32:17,208
Hey, who the hell are you, boy?

406
00:32:17,417 --> 00:32:19,625
Brother, I want change for Rs.2000.
- Bloody idiot!- Brother!

407
00:32:19,833 --> 00:32:22,042
Don't you've sense when to send in boys?

408
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:24,875
Brother, boy from our locality.
No problem at all, brother.

409
00:32:30,958 --> 00:32:32,000
Bye, brother.

410
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:35,500
Brother, correct.

411
00:32:35,708 --> 00:32:37,667
Store rice and bring husk.

412
00:33:16,625 --> 00:33:18,000
Hey, what's this?

413
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,667
Hey...

414
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:22,750
Connect me to Pudupet Inspector, please.

415
00:33:26,042 --> 00:33:27,042
Sir!

416
00:33:27,208 --> 00:33:30,875
Who deals with illegal money
in your area?

417
00:33:31,083 --> 00:33:33,667
There's one Kumar, sir.
- Kumar? Who is it?

418
00:33:33,833 --> 00:33:35,750
He runs a flower shop in Washermanpet.

419
00:33:35,958 --> 00:33:38,042
He's into this illegal money
business for long time, sir.

420
00:33:38,208 --> 00:33:39,750
Washermanpet Flower Market!

421
00:33:40,292 --> 00:33:41,208
Come immediately.

422
00:33:41,417 --> 00:33:42,333
We must catch him.

423
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,250
Hello sir.
- Tell me, Diya.

424
00:34:24,458 --> 00:34:25,417
Navya, for whom I'm here,

425
00:34:25,625 --> 00:34:27,833
she's in regular touch with Malik,

426
00:34:28,042 --> 00:34:31,208
it's true that she was with him
on the day money went missing.

427
00:34:31,417 --> 00:34:34,333
But I don't think she has any
connection with the robbery.

428
00:34:34,542 --> 00:34:36,083
Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

429
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:41,125
Take it, sister.
- Give it to sister.

430
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:48,958
Hey, boy! Come here.
- What's it, sister?

431
00:34:50,208 --> 00:34:51,250
Where did you get this notes from?

432
00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:53,042
No change in small shops, sister.

433
00:34:53,208 --> 00:34:56,458
It took long time, so I went to
flower market for change, sister.

434
00:34:56,667 --> 00:34:58,458
Can you take me to the shop
from where you got this note?

435
00:34:58,667 --> 00:34:59,375
Okay, sister.

436
00:34:59,542 --> 00:35:01,125
What's this?
The man who entered hasn't come out.

437
00:35:01,292 --> 00:35:02,208
Let's check.
- Come.

438
00:35:06,208 --> 00:35:08,458
Come to godown with our boys.

439
00:35:11,125 --> 00:35:13,333
Boys, stop and hack him.

440
00:35:14,083 --> 00:35:15,000
Kill him, boys!

441
00:36:52,417 --> 00:36:55,625
Already there are many
pending cases on Kumar, sir.

442
00:36:55,958 --> 00:36:56,875
That's him, sir.

443
00:37:00,792 --> 00:37:02,125
What's it, sir?
What do you want, sir?

444
00:37:02,292 --> 00:37:04,583
We want to buy a wreath for you.

445
00:37:05,208 --> 00:37:07,833
Sir, I'm not worth as you think so.

446
00:37:08,042 --> 00:37:09,250
If I did it, I would accept it, sir.

447
00:37:09,458 --> 00:37:12,417
Need some support from Delhi
to pull off such a big heist, sir.

448
00:37:12,625 --> 00:37:14,083
What I do is of local level only, sir.

449
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:17,042
Ask about me with him, sir.
He knows my history completely.

450
00:37:17,208 --> 00:37:17,875
Please tell him, sir.

451
00:37:18,083 --> 00:37:19,458
How long we've been
doing business together?

452
00:37:19,667 --> 00:37:23,000
That's why so many cases are pending!

453
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:41,875
Can't you watch and go?

454
00:37:42,875 --> 00:37:43,583
Sorry!

455
00:37:47,208 --> 00:37:48,000
Hey!

456
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:56,542
Oh no!

457
00:37:59,458 --> 00:38:02,042
Inquire what's the problem!
- Okay, sir.

458
00:38:02,208 --> 00:38:03,875
Hey old man, come here.

459
00:38:04,042 --> 00:38:07,458
Hey, what's your age and his age?
Don't you've common sense?

460
00:38:07,667 --> 00:38:09,625
Are you so great if you
wear khaki uniform?

461
00:38:09,833 --> 00:38:11,375
Would you call your father like this?

462
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:12,875
Sir, please come here.
- What's it, sir?

463
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:14,042
What's the problem here?

464
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:18,333
Just few minutes earlier,
heard a loud sound of bomb blast.

465
00:38:18,542 --> 00:38:21,958
There's some problem inside,
I don't know the details.

466
00:38:25,125 --> 00:38:26,333
We mustn't leave him.

467
00:38:26,542 --> 00:38:28,250
Send our boys for him.

468
00:38:28,458 --> 00:38:29,208
Got it?
- Okay, brother.

469
00:38:29,417 --> 00:38:30,417
Go, boys.

470
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:33,917
Tell me, sir.

471
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:35,875
What's the problem here?
- No problem, sir.

472
00:38:36,083 --> 00:38:39,458
Looks like boys were bursting crackers.
That's it, sir.

473
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,458
Looks like they played havoc
with different crackers.

474
00:38:52,292 --> 00:38:54,750
Tell me the truth I say!

475
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:56,833
Sister, I got the change from here only.

476
00:38:57,125 --> 00:38:57,875
Come on I say!

477
00:38:58,792 --> 00:39:00,542
I said come.
- Leave me, sir.

478
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:01,750
What's this, sir?

479
00:39:01,958 --> 00:39:03,750
Go...go...look at damn faces!
- Come on...go...

480
00:39:03,958 --> 00:39:06,208
Get into the vehicle.
Hey, get in.

481
00:39:06,375 --> 00:39:08,417
Tell them to follow the case properly.

482
00:39:10,958 --> 00:39:12,417
Do you know who that girl is, sir?

483
00:39:12,625 --> 00:39:15,500
Detective Diya, right?
- Yes, sir. The same girl.

484
00:39:15,708 --> 00:39:17,208
Why is she here?

485
00:39:17,375 --> 00:39:19,667
What's this, sir? People come to
flower market to buy flowers, right?

486
00:39:19,875 --> 00:39:22,750
Hey, get ready the vehicle to go.
- Okay, sir.

487
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:28,583
Go carefully, mother and daughter
don't slip and fall down.

488
00:39:28,792 --> 00:39:31,375
Many fell into ditch trusting you.
- Isn't he just like him?

489
00:39:31,583 --> 00:39:34,375
Who are they? Relatives?

490
00:39:34,583 --> 00:39:36,458
In away, she's like my sister.

491
00:39:36,667 --> 00:39:37,917
What? Sister?

492
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:41,125
Then, you're a suitor to that girl.
- Yes, bulb face.

493
00:39:41,333 --> 00:39:46,583
She's the only girl in my life who said
she likes and wished to marry me.

494
00:39:46,792 --> 00:39:49,125
Medical miracle!
- Why did you leave a golden chance?

495
00:39:49,917 --> 00:39:50,917
I'll tell you.

496
00:39:51,125 --> 00:39:53,708
She asked me to marry her
20 years ago!

497
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:55,875
20 years ago?

498
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:58,292
You must love her mother.

499
00:39:58,458 --> 00:39:59,375
Are you after her daughter?

500
00:39:59,583 --> 00:40:01,500
She's like cream bun
and you're like rusk.

501
00:40:01,708 --> 00:40:03,417
You're the next headline of #MeToo case.

502
00:40:03,625 --> 00:40:04,333
I didn't mean like that.

503
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,375
I did try aunty too
but uncle was with her.

504
00:40:06,625 --> 00:40:10,625
That's why I'm feeling bad.
- He tried his best.

505
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:13,083
How much he may try,
he can't get her grandma too.

506
00:40:13,292 --> 00:40:14,625
Would you like to have tea?

507
00:40:14,833 --> 00:40:16,250
No, I want to go to office tomorrow.

508
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:19,833
You wait here,
I'll come back in a minute.

509
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:24,542
Madam, please take it.

510
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:25,542
No, thanks.
- Thanks, uncle.

511
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:26,542
No problem, take it.

512
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:28,250
Say bye to uncle.
- Bye!

513
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,625
Hey Sakthi!

514
00:40:44,125 --> 00:40:45,458
Come!

515
00:40:55,625 --> 00:40:56,333
Sir!

516
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:01,833
Look, our dept. officer have made
more money than idol smugglers.

517
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:04,208
Paper media has bombarded us.

518
00:41:04,417 --> 00:41:06,292
There are so many criminals
within ourselves.

519
00:41:20,708 --> 00:41:21,583
Lights on!

520
00:41:22,292 --> 00:41:27,958
I suspect someone from our department
is involved in this illegal activity.

521
00:41:28,125 --> 00:41:34,125
If not there are chances that
he may be helping the robbers.

522
00:41:34,333 --> 00:41:37,583
Can I know the reason why you
suspect an insider thing?

523
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:38,750
I'll explain you.

524
00:41:39,292 --> 00:41:41,875
If you check the recent robberies.

525
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:43,833
Number one, train robbery.

526
00:41:44,042 --> 00:41:45,833
People who know about money transport.

527
00:41:46,042 --> 00:41:48,167
RBI, Railway, Police.

528
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:51,792
Intelligence got new about money lost
by illegal money transfer.

529
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,792
People who know about this
are victim party and police.

530
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,250
Finally, doubling!

531
00:41:56,458 --> 00:42:01,208
People who about this are
related culprits and police.

532
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:06,250
The common among
all three incidents is police.

533
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:13,042
So, I'm sure there's someone
within our department behind this.

534
00:42:13,208 --> 00:42:15,458
There are lakhs of
policemen in dept., sir.

535
00:42:15,667 --> 00:42:18,667
It is not possible to
spot one person, sir.

536
00:42:18,875 --> 00:42:22,083
If you think little seriously,
it is possible to do it.

537
00:42:26,625 --> 00:42:27,792
What Kumaravel?
- Sir!

538
00:42:29,333 --> 00:42:30,625
Didn't get any idea?

539
00:42:30,833 --> 00:42:33,250
They say we can judge a dog
by it's power to catch rabbit.

540
00:42:33,458 --> 00:42:35,417
I joined police with that hope, sir.

541
00:42:35,625 --> 00:42:38,958
I got promotion by catching
criminals like that only, sir.

542
00:42:39,167 --> 00:42:44,750
So, you say we can find the black
sheep by going around our office.

543
00:42:44,917 --> 00:42:46,125
Right?

544
00:42:46,333 --> 00:42:47,667
Sure, sir.

545
00:42:49,708 --> 00:42:54,625
Robberies are happening
in and around Chennai.

546
00:42:54,833 --> 00:42:58,583
No need to involve entire
police of the state.

547
00:42:58,792 --> 00:43:00,042
To tell you in particular,

548
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:03,583
crime money dept.
and economical crime,

549
00:43:03,792 --> 00:43:07,667
I suspect these money
connected divisions.

550
00:43:07,875 --> 00:43:12,000
So, all the divisions in Chennai,

551
00:43:12,208 --> 00:43:15,167
send an alert message as I suggest you.

552
00:43:16,417 --> 00:43:18,292
This is a welcome trap in disguise.

553
00:43:28,667 --> 00:43:29,917
Madam, courier for Diya.

554
00:43:30,125 --> 00:43:31,458
Give me, I'm her mother.

555
00:43:31,667 --> 00:43:33,458
She must sign the receipt.
Office rules.

556
00:43:33,667 --> 00:43:34,958
Okay, one minute.

557
00:43:36,792 --> 00:43:39,542
Diya, you've a courier.

558
00:43:39,833 --> 00:43:41,333
I've already sent it.

559
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,250
How is it possible?

560
00:43:43,583 --> 00:43:46,375
I need the proof on my table in 24 hours,
do you get that?

561
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:47,875
Boss is listening it
in conference call.

562
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:50,250
Don't delay.
Other cases some other time.

563
00:43:50,458 --> 00:43:53,167
First work on stabilizing video
from Navya's mobile phone.

564
00:43:53,375 --> 00:43:54,333
No more excuses.

565
00:43:54,542 --> 00:43:55,958
It's very clear.

566
00:43:56,167 --> 00:43:58,542
Don't play the fool with me.
Make it fast.

567
00:44:01,333 --> 00:44:03,000
What?
- Courier.

568
00:44:03,375 --> 00:44:05,750
You carry on the work, okay.

569
00:44:07,167 --> 00:44:07,875
So...

570
00:44:09,292 --> 00:44:12,542
Malik wrote his name in Urdu
on the stolen bag.

571
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:16,167
I saw the same bag in flower market...

572
00:44:20,667 --> 00:44:21,833
Shit...shit...

573
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:31,958
Hey...hey...

574
00:44:32,583 --> 00:44:33,333
Hey!

575
00:44:42,458 --> 00:44:45,000
Oh no, look at her, she's walking out
wrapped just in towel.

576
00:44:45,208 --> 00:44:46,833
At least let her escape from you.

577
00:44:48,792 --> 00:44:50,542
Stop...where are you going?

578
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:51,458
Diya!

579
00:44:51,792 --> 00:44:53,958
Hey you!

580
00:44:54,333 --> 00:44:55,417
Rascal!

581
00:44:55,792 --> 00:44:57,125
Rogue...rascal.

582
00:44:57,333 --> 00:44:58,833
Shit...shit...

583
00:45:00,458 --> 00:45:05,000
I just missed him.
- Please come inside immediately.

584
00:45:05,167 --> 00:45:06,542
Come...
Listen to me, come in first.

585
00:45:06,917 --> 00:45:09,625
You're ruining family honour in street.
Go inside. Go!

586
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:11,833
Look, what's your problem?

587
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,167
What's that you're shouting
on the top of your voice?

588
00:45:14,375 --> 00:45:16,208
A man went just now...rascal.

589
00:45:16,417 --> 00:45:18,750
I was searching him for a theft case.

590
00:45:18,917 --> 00:45:20,958
He was right before our door...

591
00:45:21,167 --> 00:45:22,042
I missed him like a fool.

592
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:24,458
Look, you missed him.

593
00:45:24,667 --> 00:45:25,833
Why are you shouting on him?

594
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,792
You've courier address with you, right?

595
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:30,125
Why not go and meet him there?

596
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:36,125
Are you running a courier office
or something else?

597
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:38,458
What do you mean by it?
I didn't get you, madam.

598
00:45:38,667 --> 00:45:39,625
What is your problem?

599
00:45:39,833 --> 00:45:41,375
Why are you shouting angrily?

600
00:45:41,583 --> 00:45:43,125
Please sit and cool down.

601
00:45:43,333 --> 00:45:44,417
How can I cool down?

602
00:45:44,625 --> 00:45:45,917
It was an express delivery.

603
00:45:46,125 --> 00:45:47,083
Extremely confidential.

604
00:45:47,292 --> 00:45:50,042
But you've seen the content inside.

605
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:51,083
I'm going to sue you.

606
00:45:51,292 --> 00:45:55,417
I don't have time to see all that
and I'm not interested too.

607
00:45:55,625 --> 00:45:58,208
If not you, your delivery boy
may have seen it.

608
00:45:58,417 --> 00:46:02,375
My boys are not like that.
- Hello, I must see delivery boy now.

609
00:46:02,583 --> 00:46:04,667
Oh God!

610
00:46:04,958 --> 00:46:06,125
Please sit down, madam.

611
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:10,125
Which area are you from?
- Shanti Nagar.

612
00:46:11,125 --> 00:46:12,708
Shanti Nagar!

613
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Oh Sakthi!

614
00:46:15,917 --> 00:46:17,417
Hey!
- Sir?

615
00:46:17,625 --> 00:46:20,125
Call and ask him to come
to office immediately.

616
00:46:20,333 --> 00:46:22,833
He deliver courier packages later.
- Okay, sir.

617
00:46:23,167 --> 00:46:24,750
If you engage thieves,
this is what they do.

618
00:46:24,917 --> 00:46:27,208
Hello, don't talk unnecessarily.

619
00:46:27,417 --> 00:46:30,833
This is not a finance company
to engage only thieves.

620
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,375
He's an engineering student.
Do you know that?

621
00:46:34,042 --> 00:46:36,917
Only technically sound man
can plan and rob like this.

622
00:46:37,125 --> 00:46:40,750
Why? Won't an engineering
student open the cover?

623
00:46:40,917 --> 00:46:43,792
Half of the chain snatchers
in Chennai are students only.

624
00:46:43,958 --> 00:46:45,500
Give me his number,
I'll talk to him.

625
00:46:45,708 --> 00:46:48,042
I can't give him number,
leave your address here.

626
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:50,042
As soon as he comes,
I'll ask him to meet you.

627
00:46:51,333 --> 00:46:53,750
No need for him to come,
I'll take care of him myself.

628
00:46:57,542 --> 00:46:58,417
Oh my God!

629
00:46:58,875 --> 00:47:01,167
Had I been little complacent,
she would've killed me!

630
00:47:26,125 --> 00:47:28,417
Enough! You're drinking too much.

631
00:47:28,625 --> 00:47:29,250
You may fall flat.

632
00:47:29,458 --> 00:47:32,083
For clean India campaign,
they want us not to pollute river Ganges.

633
00:47:32,292 --> 00:47:35,375
Tell them not pollute Old Monk whisky
under clean India campaign.

634
00:47:35,583 --> 00:47:37,458
Even after drinking half bottle
I'm not getting the kick.

635
00:47:37,667 --> 00:47:38,792
How can you get the kick?

636
00:47:38,958 --> 00:47:41,417
Hello, I talked to the owner,
he says he doesn't know you.

637
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:43,750
Dhoti clad men are banned in bar.
Can you please come out?

638
00:47:43,917 --> 00:47:46,125
What's this injustice?

639
00:47:46,333 --> 00:47:47,750
Dhoti is our state's dress.

640
00:47:47,917 --> 00:47:49,958
He's not allowing men in dhoti.

641
00:47:50,542 --> 00:47:53,042
Nobody is asking him,
all are just watching fun.

642
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:56,917
This nation stopped Gandhi from entering
because he didn't wear a shirt.

643
00:47:57,125 --> 00:47:59,458
Even you're watching the fun.
Why don't you stop him?

644
00:47:59,667 --> 00:48:02,000
Oh no, hey...I said that by mistake.

645
00:48:02,208 --> 00:48:04,000
I know about your courage.

646
00:48:04,167 --> 00:48:06,125
Please sit tight here...come.

647
00:48:06,333 --> 00:48:09,458
Buddy, you brought me
to complete normal.

648
00:48:09,833 --> 00:48:12,875
It's common rule in bars of star hotels.

649
00:48:13,042 --> 00:48:15,917
Can we raise a banner of
revolt against bars?

650
00:48:16,083 --> 00:48:18,375
If I stop them now,
they'll first throw us out.

651
00:48:18,583 --> 00:48:21,125
How dare you lay hands on me!

652
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:21,917
Dare come out, man!

653
00:48:22,083 --> 00:48:25,375
You're in dept. but
you're totally useless.

654
00:48:25,583 --> 00:48:29,500
Public is more powerful than dept.
You know that, right?

655
00:48:29,792 --> 00:48:31,000
They forced to conduct
taming of bull, right?

656
00:48:33,292 --> 00:48:35,833
Dept. brings to my memory.

657
00:48:36,042 --> 00:48:39,208
Buddy, Manickavasagam is working
more than what he's paid for.

658
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:42,125
To catch you,
he sent a fake alert message,

659
00:48:42,292 --> 00:48:45,917
he spread news about
big money collection in a bank.

660
00:48:46,125 --> 00:48:50,500
He thinks if it is big money,
you'll surely come for it.

661
00:48:50,708 --> 00:48:53,042
He thinks you're a professional thief.

662
00:48:53,208 --> 00:48:56,000
He's going to wait for you in bank.
- Oh!

663
00:48:56,833 --> 00:48:58,208
I'm James Bond, right?
I found out everything.

664
00:48:58,417 --> 00:49:00,833
He too is just like you.
- You mean brilliant?

665
00:49:01,042 --> 00:49:02,083
Thanks, buddy.

666
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:04,958
You both are bloody f...
- Hey...oh no!

667
00:49:24,917 --> 00:49:27,833
As per our alert message,
do you think he'll come here, sir?

668
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:29,167
Sure!

669
00:49:29,375 --> 00:49:32,042
I've kept tamarind seed
box up there, bring it.

670
00:49:32,208 --> 00:49:34,125
Do you want me to read you palm, sir?

671
00:49:34,292 --> 00:49:35,875
Come...is it you?

672
00:49:36,083 --> 00:49:38,125
Season is over?
- Yes, sir.

673
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:40,375
I told you not to trust that channel.

674
00:49:40,583 --> 00:49:42,125
Why should we get into trouble, sir?
- What's the matter?

675
00:49:42,333 --> 00:49:46,542
If you show me your palm,
I'll tell past, present and future, sir.

676
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:48,333
No need to pay me anything,
I'll tell you for free.

677
00:49:48,542 --> 00:49:50,375
Even if you tell correctly,
I can't pay you.

678
00:49:50,583 --> 00:49:52,917
I'll offer a cup of coffee,
have it and go.

679
00:49:53,125 --> 00:49:55,792
Sir, I can see many streaks in your face.
- What?

680
00:49:55,958 --> 00:49:57,083
On my face?

681
00:49:57,292 --> 00:49:59,583
Check if I can find a bride.
- Let me see it.

682
00:50:00,125 --> 00:50:01,125
You'll surely find a bride, sir.

683
00:50:01,333 --> 00:50:03,042
For your hand...
- Boy, bring chair for him.

684
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:03,958
Okay, brother.

685
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:07,250
This hand is in for a windfall of luck.
- For this hand?

686
00:50:07,458 --> 00:50:10,458
A vehicle from South West side.
- What? A container?

687
00:50:10,667 --> 00:50:12,375
You're in tea shop because
of your motor mouth.

688
00:50:12,583 --> 00:50:13,250
Listen to me silently.

689
00:50:13,458 --> 00:50:17,917
A beautiful angel in different
style of dress in that vehicle.

690
00:50:18,125 --> 00:50:21,042
Angel?
- Angel will come to your shop.

691
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:22,625
She'll come here.

692
00:50:22,833 --> 00:50:25,167
Your life will turn topsy-turvy.

693
00:50:25,542 --> 00:50:26,375
Will it surely happen?

694
00:50:26,583 --> 00:50:29,167
It'll surely happen,
look up, you can see her face.

695
00:50:32,708 --> 00:50:37,333
I saw her back only!
I didn't see her face.

696
00:50:37,542 --> 00:50:40,458
Will you see only back?
You must see front also in life.

697
00:50:40,667 --> 00:50:43,750
How forward we may go in life,
we must also look back, right?

698
00:50:43,917 --> 00:50:45,542
That's why I said that.
How was my punch?

699
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:48,625
Sakthi, he's telling future perfectly.

700
00:50:48,833 --> 00:50:51,250
Get to know about your future from him.

701
00:50:51,458 --> 00:50:53,750
I don't need it.
- Keep the paper there.

702
00:50:53,917 --> 00:50:54,917
Show me your palm, Sakthi.

703
00:50:55,125 --> 00:50:57,125
I'll tell few things,
say I'm right if you feel so.

704
00:50:57,292 --> 00:50:57,958
That's enough!

705
00:50:58,167 --> 00:50:59,833
I'll take money from onlookers.

706
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,125
Am I a monkey?

707
00:51:01,333 --> 00:51:02,417
You say you'll collect money
from onlookers.

708
00:51:02,625 --> 00:51:03,375
I didn't say that,
don't confirm it yourself.- Okay.

709
00:51:03,583 --> 00:51:04,458
Check his palm.

710
00:51:04,667 --> 00:51:06,917
Show me your palm, Sakthi.
Show me.

711
00:51:07,125 --> 00:51:10,500
Sakthi, your name is very powerful.

712
00:51:10,708 --> 00:51:13,792
Your palm shows you're an expert.

713
00:51:13,958 --> 00:51:15,125
You haven't yet seen my hand,
what are you saying?

714
00:51:15,333 --> 00:51:16,750
See his palm, man.

715
00:51:16,917 --> 00:51:25,125
This palm will play in millions of cash!
- He can't pay for tea, but he says millions.

716
00:51:25,167 --> 00:51:27,375
Lady luck is always smiling on you.
- I think so.

717
00:51:27,583 --> 00:51:28,083
Eh?

718
00:51:28,292 --> 00:51:30,958
Lakshmi Menon will be with him.
So be it.

719
00:51:31,167 --> 00:51:35,417
Govt. will come to you to offer you a job.

720
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:38,583
Today is auspicious Akshaya Tritiya,
you're in for a windfall of luck.

721
00:51:38,792 --> 00:51:43,083
Whatever luck brings to you,
bad luck may follow to take it away.

722
00:51:43,292 --> 00:51:47,667
Though you act like a good man,
you achieve things stealthily.

723
00:51:47,875 --> 00:51:49,125
Am I right?

724
00:51:49,333 --> 00:51:50,917
Oh God!
- Move, man.

725
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:52,583
Go, man.

726
00:51:53,667 --> 00:51:56,750
Why is getting so angry?
- Why is he hitting me?

727
00:51:56,917 --> 00:52:00,542
If you talk too much,
he'll surely kick you.

728
00:52:25,167 --> 00:52:29,417
He spread fake news about
big money collection in bank.

729
00:53:55,917 --> 00:53:56,708
Hey!

730
00:53:56,875 --> 00:53:58,458
Can't you walk carefully?

731
00:53:59,375 --> 00:54:00,125
It's okay.

732
00:54:02,583 --> 00:54:05,167
I want to withdraw cash.
- Wait for 2 minutes, please.

733
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:14,375
Excuse me, sir.

734
00:54:14,708 --> 00:54:15,958
Where are you going in?
- Lift!

735
00:54:16,167 --> 00:54:17,042
This is not lift, sir.

736
00:54:17,375 --> 00:54:18,875
This is restricted area.

737
00:54:19,042 --> 00:54:20,375
Lift is outside near steps, sir.

738
00:54:20,583 --> 00:54:22,708
Oh!
- Please, sir.

739
00:54:22,875 --> 00:54:23,500
Okay.

740
00:56:42,542 --> 00:56:44,375
Please come to get cash.

741
00:56:50,167 --> 00:56:51,125
Sir!

742
00:56:55,917 --> 00:56:58,583
Dug a hole in wall!
- Yes, broke open lockers too.

743
00:56:58,792 --> 00:56:59,458
Oh shit!

744
00:57:13,125 --> 00:57:14,958
Hey Jagan!
- Tell me.

745
00:57:15,583 --> 00:57:19,042
Did you come to home?
- No, I'm on duty, what's the matter?

746
00:57:19,917 --> 00:57:24,167
Door was open, so I asked you.
- Door was open? What are you saying?

747
00:57:24,375 --> 00:57:27,292
Check your room door.
- It's okay.

748
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,792
First check if it is okay.

749
00:57:29,958 --> 00:57:32,375
Why are you giving me tension?

750
00:57:32,583 --> 00:57:34,583
Buddy, it's better to be safe
than be sorry.

751
00:57:34,792 --> 00:57:36,250
For God's sake, please...
- Okay, wait.

752
00:57:43,583 --> 00:57:44,417
Hey Sakthi!

753
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:49,667
Answer me please.

754
00:57:52,125 --> 00:57:52,833
Hey!

755
00:57:54,958 --> 00:57:58,125
Hey, answer me, please.
- Everything is okay...

756
00:58:50,667 --> 00:58:53,792
I've sent you an address,
ask Jamaluddin to come there, sir.

757
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,417
Sakthi...Sakthi...

758
00:59:03,875 --> 00:59:06,333
Sakthi...Sakthi...
What happened to you?

759
00:59:06,542 --> 00:59:07,708
How did he get hurt?

760
00:59:07,875 --> 00:59:10,708
He shouldn't have been
alive for his crimes.

761
00:59:10,875 --> 00:59:13,708
What's your problem with him?
I asked you, how did he get hurt?

762
00:59:13,875 --> 00:59:16,583
Hey, don't shout.

763
00:59:16,792 --> 00:59:17,708
I hit him.

764
00:59:17,875 --> 00:59:21,792
Will you file FIR on me?
Or else call the police myself?

765
00:59:21,917 --> 00:59:25,125
I'm also police,
are you threatening me?

766
00:59:25,333 --> 00:59:27,125
Yes, indeed a threat.

767
00:59:27,333 --> 00:59:31,708
You're a police man and
an accomplice of robber like him.

768
00:59:31,875 --> 00:59:33,083
You must be...

769
00:59:33,292 --> 00:59:34,875
Are you Mother Teresa?

770
00:59:35,083 --> 00:59:37,167
You and your boss work
for criminals only.

771
00:59:37,375 --> 00:59:43,167
You filled a room with money stolen
from others but call yourselves innocents.

772
00:59:43,375 --> 00:59:45,292
Are we criminals then?

773
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:47,375
Tell me, how big is your network?

774
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:48,458
For whom you're working?

775
00:59:48,667 --> 00:59:50,750
Is every robber a criminal?

776
00:59:50,917 --> 00:59:54,875
Then what? Are you helping
poor like shown in films?

777
00:59:55,042 --> 00:59:56,792
Or else educating poor children
with the money?

778
00:59:56,917 --> 00:59:57,708
What the hell are you doing?

779
00:59:57,875 --> 01:00:00,583
We're going to pay Rs.6000
for every voter!

780
01:00:00,792 --> 01:00:01,708
Talking too much.

781
01:00:01,875 --> 01:00:05,083
He didn't have a tea with the money
he stole from others, you know that?.

782
01:00:05,292 --> 01:00:09,417
You'll have a story or reason
for dumping stolen money here, right?

783
01:00:09,625 --> 01:00:10,917
Come on tell me, I'll listen to it.

784
01:00:11,125 --> 01:00:14,542
Please, for others Sakthi
appears like a thief.

785
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:16,875
But that's not the truth, Diya.

786
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:19,542
Sakthi lost his father before he was born.

787
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:22,500
As a child he started to feel happy
on seeing money.

788
01:00:26,833 --> 01:00:30,833
When devotees put donation in priest's
plate after offer prayers in temple.

789
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,167
But he was very happy taking
money from the plate.

790
01:00:34,375 --> 01:00:36,833
But nobody knew it then
that this wasn't a normal act.

791
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,833
As Sakthi grew up,
his problem too grew along with him.

792
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,042
He started losing his control
even in school.

793
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:45,417
Pocket money of his classmates,
school fee,

794
01:00:45,625 --> 01:00:48,125
his concentration was always on money.

795
01:00:48,542 --> 01:00:53,417
One fine night, a rat tasted
the money Sakthi had stashed.

796
01:01:06,375 --> 01:01:10,125
This incident lead his mother
to know about his problem.

797
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:13,708
Why did you steal money?
- Mother, I don't know.

798
01:01:13,875 --> 01:01:18,625
Will you do it again?
- No, I don't know, mother.

799
01:01:18,875 --> 01:01:20,875
Sakthi, this is wrong my son.

800
01:01:21,083 --> 01:01:24,083
If you want anything, ask me,
I'll buy it for you, son.

801
01:01:24,292 --> 01:01:27,875
You must steal others' money
who work hard to save it.

802
01:01:28,083 --> 01:01:29,875
You did it till now without
knowing about it.

803
01:01:30,083 --> 01:01:31,083
Don't do it hereafter.

804
01:01:31,292 --> 01:01:33,333
You'll listen to your mother, right?

805
01:01:33,625 --> 01:01:36,208
I'll do whatever you ask me, mother.

806
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:44,833
But the desire to steal money
didn't let Sakthi to remain peaceful.

807
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:51,000
The desire to steal and
his mother's advice clashed in his mind.

808
01:02:05,542 --> 01:02:08,500
The desire to steal won over him!

809
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:11,917
Your son stole money kept
for paying school fee.

810
01:02:12,125 --> 01:02:13,875
No use if you give birth to a son.

811
01:02:14,083 --> 01:02:15,708
You must know how to raise him also.

812
01:02:15,875 --> 01:02:19,125
Instead of earning with a son like him,
better to do something else for a living.

813
01:02:19,333 --> 01:02:25,333
Kids like him become dacoits,
rapists and criminals to trouble police.

814
01:02:25,542 --> 01:02:27,792
Bring the kid to court.

815
01:02:32,167 --> 01:02:33,125
Sakthi!

816
01:02:40,833 --> 01:02:44,125
Wherever you may be,
I'll always think about you only, son.

817
01:02:44,333 --> 01:02:46,708
The sorrow of her son becoming a thief,

818
01:02:46,875 --> 01:02:49,167
the way society humiliated them,

819
01:02:49,375 --> 01:02:52,500
it pushed Sakthi's mother
to take a hard decision.

820
01:02:56,792 --> 01:03:00,875
If his mother had been alive,
may be Sakthi's life could be different.

821
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:02,292
Poor Sakthi!

822
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:03,208
Government Juvenile Home - Chengalpattu

823
01:03:03,417 --> 01:03:05,458
I was there for an unwitting crime,

824
01:03:05,667 --> 01:03:07,333
Sakthi was there for mistake
he did without his knowledge.

825
01:03:07,542 --> 01:03:10,500
We both met in this juvenile home.

826
01:03:10,708 --> 01:03:13,083
He didn't talk to anyone there
but befriended me.

827
01:03:13,292 --> 01:03:14,708
He talked, laughed
and cried with me.

828
01:03:14,875 --> 01:03:16,208
He told me everything.

829
01:03:16,417 --> 01:03:20,542
Our friendship grew stronger
enough to last for our life time.

830
01:03:23,583 --> 01:03:26,708
But the beast in Sakthi didn't
let him live peacefully there also.

831
01:03:26,875 --> 01:03:29,083
Why are you not responding to me?

832
01:03:29,292 --> 01:03:31,292
What happened to you, Sakthi?

833
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:32,792
Sakthi...Sakthi...
- Oh mother!

834
01:03:33,167 --> 01:03:35,708
What happened to you, Sakthi?
What's happening with you?

835
01:03:35,875 --> 01:03:36,875
Oh mother!

836
01:03:47,917 --> 01:03:49,792
Hey Sakthi! What are you doing?

837
01:03:54,208 --> 01:03:56,917
Who stole the money?
- Sakthi stole it, sir.

838
01:04:06,875 --> 01:04:09,083
Why are you hitting me, sir?

839
01:04:09,292 --> 01:04:11,000
Don't hit me, please sir.
Don't hit me, sir.

840
01:04:11,208 --> 01:04:13,500
Sakthi, you take rest.

841
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:17,542
This is too cruel, Rajendran.

842
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:19,375
What if something had happened to him?

843
01:04:19,583 --> 01:04:23,542
Boys are sent here instead of jail
to give them a chance to reform.

844
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:25,708
You come here only
when someone is hurt, right?

845
01:04:25,875 --> 01:04:29,375
Come here everyday, you'd know
what I'm going through with them.

846
01:04:29,583 --> 01:04:32,542
He'll steal money from my room
and sleep silently.

847
01:04:32,750 --> 01:04:33,750
Should I watch it silently?

848
01:04:33,917 --> 01:04:35,167
Very good logic, sir.

849
01:04:35,375 --> 01:04:37,708
Forget about our logic, sir.

850
01:04:37,875 --> 01:04:40,583
As far as Sakthi is concerned,
handle him carefully.

851
01:04:40,792 --> 01:04:45,708
When I talked to him, I realised there's
no purpose behind his stealing money.

852
01:04:45,875 --> 01:04:47,708
He opened your bureau
to steal money,

853
01:04:47,875 --> 01:04:52,917
he didn't touch expensive
gold watch, gold chain or rings.

854
01:04:53,167 --> 01:04:54,333
This could be a disease also.

855
01:04:54,542 --> 01:04:56,875
Is he a psycho thief?

856
01:04:57,083 --> 01:04:59,292
There's no such word in
medical terminology.

857
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:04,583
If any incident like this happens again,
please don't hit him.

858
01:05:04,792 --> 01:05:08,292
It may push him to become
a hardened criminal.

859
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:13,083
Moreover when you try to control
physical changes during this phase,

860
01:05:13,292 --> 01:05:15,917
there's a chance it may
take his life also.

861
01:05:16,125 --> 01:05:17,500
I understood Sakthi's problem.

862
01:05:17,708 --> 01:05:19,875
I decided to look after
his carefully till the end.

863
01:05:20,083 --> 01:05:22,333
Robbing increased along with his age.

864
01:05:22,542 --> 01:05:25,125
He stacks notes in room
to see and enjoy.

865
01:05:25,333 --> 01:05:27,417
For him money is Queen.

866
01:05:27,625 --> 01:05:28,708
He'll look after her very carefully.

867
01:05:28,875 --> 01:05:31,917
Nobody must touch his money,
including me.

868
01:05:33,333 --> 01:05:36,917
I joined police force,
I entered crime division for him only.

869
01:05:37,125 --> 01:05:40,917
Doctor's advice in juvenile home
left a great impact on me.

870
01:05:41,125 --> 01:05:43,375
Whenever his mind triggers
to steal money.

871
01:05:43,583 --> 01:05:45,000
I bring him to my control,

872
01:05:45,208 --> 01:05:46,875
and send him to places
where illegal money is stashed.

873
01:05:47,083 --> 01:05:49,875
But at times he goes out of my control
and steals money from risky places.

874
01:05:50,083 --> 01:05:52,167
You know Sakthi as a thief only.

875
01:05:52,375 --> 01:06:00,917
But nobody knows how he struggled to stop
himself or pain I went through to control him.

876
01:06:01,208 --> 01:06:04,708
You let him grow into a thief
and narrating story to me.

877
01:06:04,875 --> 01:06:05,625
Aren't you ashamed of it?

878
01:06:05,833 --> 01:06:09,542
You don't need a reason to be
loyal in love or friendship, Diya.

879
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:12,875
Money is his disease and
stealing is the only treatment.

880
01:06:13,042 --> 01:06:16,083
What you did to him is not help,
it's cheating.

881
01:06:16,292 --> 01:06:21,292
Look, Sakthi is my friend.
I'm struggling to keep him alive.

882
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:24,583
I may be a criminal according to you,
I don't care about it.

883
01:06:24,792 --> 01:06:27,083
I don't owe you any explanation also.

884
01:06:27,292 --> 01:06:28,333
Shut up and go out.

885
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:32,625
Oh shit!

886
01:06:37,417 --> 01:06:38,083
Oh no!

887
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:41,875
Sakthi!
- Jagan!

888
01:06:42,792 --> 01:06:44,417
Take him away from here.

889
01:06:44,625 --> 01:06:46,292
If you stay here, no safety for both of you.

890
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:48,167
What are you saying?
What happened?

891
01:06:48,375 --> 01:06:49,875
I don't have time to explain you.

892
01:06:50,083 --> 01:06:51,875
You said you're doing all this
to keep him alive, right?

893
01:06:52,083 --> 01:06:53,625
I'm telling you for the same reason.

894
01:06:53,833 --> 01:06:55,208
Just follow my order.

895
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,917
Who is it? Who is he?

896
01:07:10,167 --> 01:07:12,000
I'll hack him into pieces.
Where is he?

897
01:07:12,208 --> 01:07:14,500
Bloody street dog who dared
to steal my money.

898
01:07:18,917 --> 01:07:20,125
So much money!

899
01:07:23,833 --> 01:07:25,750
I tried my best but he managed
to escape.

900
01:07:25,917 --> 01:07:28,583
I found your money only.
I'll find him soon.

901
01:07:28,792 --> 01:07:31,292
When you found his place,
you should've informed me, right?

902
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:32,583
Wouldn't I've taken him?

903
01:07:32,792 --> 01:07:35,000
Why the hell did you try to catch him?

904
01:07:35,208 --> 01:07:40,083
Did he escape really
or took money to let him go?

905
01:07:40,625 --> 01:07:44,125
I told him not to give the job to you,
did he care to listen to me?

906
01:07:44,333 --> 01:07:46,500
Okay, I'll take care of you later.

907
01:07:46,708 --> 01:07:48,125
Son!- Father.
- Pack money in bags.

908
01:07:49,417 --> 01:07:50,125
Hey!

909
01:07:54,083 --> 01:07:57,750
I told you to pack money,
what are you ogling at?

910
01:07:57,917 --> 01:07:59,917
Boys, pack money in bags.

911
01:08:00,125 --> 01:08:01,875
Hey...hey...

912
01:08:03,083 --> 01:08:04,208
What are you doing?

913
01:08:04,792 --> 01:08:05,875
Just ask them to take only your money.

914
01:08:06,083 --> 01:08:08,000
Your job is over long time back.

915
01:08:08,208 --> 01:08:10,542
I'll take care of things from here.
You can go now.

916
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:12,542
Malik, load entire cash in car.

917
01:08:12,750 --> 01:08:16,542
If you take a rupee more than
your money, I'll not spare you.

918
01:08:16,750 --> 01:08:17,542
Bloody!

919
01:08:18,250 --> 01:08:20,417
What? What will you do?

920
01:08:20,625 --> 01:08:24,208
Just clear out.
If not I'll kill you.

921
01:08:25,125 --> 01:08:27,375
Acting as if she's a chaste woman!

922
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Hey, don't miss one mote also,
pack everything.

923
01:08:31,208 --> 01:08:31,917
Pack every note here.

924
01:08:32,625 --> 01:08:34,875
If you miss one note also,
I'll kill you.

925
01:08:35,083 --> 01:08:36,708
Come on, pack it quickly.

926
01:08:36,875 --> 01:08:37,875
Pack and tie the bag safely.

927
01:08:38,083 --> 01:08:40,208
Hey crook, do it quickly.
Tie it.

928
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:41,500
Load it in car.

929
01:08:41,875 --> 01:08:45,875
Come quickly, boys.
Come...come...

930
01:08:48,917 --> 01:08:50,875
I told you earlier.

931
01:08:51,083 --> 01:08:56,500
I'll find the dog who crossed
my path to find and kill him.

932
01:08:57,875 --> 01:09:00,417
Come...come...load it quickly.
Load it.

933
01:09:00,875 --> 01:09:02,333
careful...careful...

934
01:09:02,542 --> 01:09:03,083
Boys!
- Tell me, bhai.

935
01:09:03,292 --> 01:09:05,208
You go back to shed.
- Okay.

936
01:09:09,458 --> 01:09:10,708
After the alert message,

937
01:09:10,875 --> 01:09:15,875
did you trace call list of the
related division officers?

938
01:09:16,083 --> 01:09:16,875
Yes, sir.

939
01:09:17,083 --> 01:09:22,125
If they're from our office,
track the history of their operations.

940
01:09:22,333 --> 01:09:25,333
Don't delay.
- I've tracked all the calls, sir.

941
01:09:25,542 --> 01:09:26,875
We'll get information by afternoon, sir.

942
01:09:27,083 --> 01:09:27,917
Good.

943
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:31,750
Hello!- Hello!
- Yes, Manick.

944
01:09:31,917 --> 01:09:34,833
I'm Markandeyan here.
I called you to give you information.

945
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
The officer you're searching
for corruption,

946
01:09:37,208 --> 01:09:40,750
is travelling in TN-76-A-5000
on Tambaram bye pass road.

947
01:09:40,917 --> 01:09:43,292
If you go immediately you can
arrest him and confiscate money.

948
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:44,167
Got it?

949
01:09:44,375 --> 01:09:45,542
Who are you?

950
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:47,917
You're the first man in police
to ask me who I am!

951
01:09:48,125 --> 01:09:50,667
I'm Dinakaran of Digital India.

952
01:10:02,208 --> 01:10:04,875
Sir, information is correct.

953
01:10:05,333 --> 01:10:06,208
Come on, let's go.

954
01:10:06,917 --> 01:10:08,917
Father, police.
- Don't stop, just keep going.

955
01:10:09,125 --> 01:10:09,917
Hey, it's Manickavasagam!

956
01:10:10,125 --> 01:10:12,542
If he catches us, he'll surely kill us.

957
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:13,542
Hey, don't get down.

958
01:10:13,750 --> 01:10:15,500
Before he kills me, I'll kill him.
- Listen to me, son.

959
01:10:18,083 --> 01:10:19,417
Malik, come here.

960
01:10:22,417 --> 01:10:24,500
Son Malik!

961
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:46,750
Sir!

962
01:10:46,917 --> 01:10:49,250
I'll tell you a place,
keep the cash safely there.

963
01:10:49,458 --> 01:10:50,375
Okay, sir.

964
01:11:26,917 --> 01:11:31,667
Hey, be patient, dude!

965
01:11:32,042 --> 01:11:33,333
Hey Sakthi!

966
01:11:37,542 --> 01:11:39,333
Who took it?
Where's the money?

967
01:11:39,667 --> 01:11:41,292
Where's the money?
Tell me I say!

968
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:43,333
I want my money.
Tell me.

969
01:11:43,542 --> 01:11:46,167
When you were in hospital,
I told you about detective Diya, right?

970
01:11:46,375 --> 01:11:48,333
She got us out from here.

971
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:49,833
We've to catch her to get information.

972
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,125
Buddy, stay calm.
- Who is she?

973
01:11:52,333 --> 01:11:55,333
Hey, I'll not spare her alive.
- Hey, please.

974
01:11:55,542 --> 01:11:56,833
Hey Sakthi!

975
01:11:58,333 --> 01:12:00,542
I knew on seeing the
modus operandi of train robbery.

976
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:02,750
It must a young man's job.

977
01:12:02,917 --> 01:12:04,000
Not only that,

978
01:12:04,208 --> 01:12:07,792
the way he thrashed goons
in flower market to steal money,

979
01:12:07,917 --> 01:12:09,583
the way he technically robbed bank,

980
01:12:09,792 --> 01:12:11,083
this fact is very clear.

981
01:12:11,292 --> 01:12:15,333
But we can't do anything
with just the age factor of robber.

982
01:12:15,542 --> 01:12:19,167
Malik is a young man, right?
Why can't he be the robber?

983
01:12:19,375 --> 01:12:21,208
He's a useless guy.

984
01:12:21,417 --> 01:12:25,792
Can't decide he's the accused
because money was with him?

985
01:12:25,917 --> 01:12:28,333
Other than going after women,
he's not smart in anything else.

986
01:12:28,542 --> 01:12:32,500
Find how they got this money!

987
01:12:32,708 --> 01:12:37,917
We'll get clarity in case and find the
real culprit on arresting Jamaluddin.

988
01:12:38,125 --> 01:12:39,292
Yes, sir.

989
01:12:40,417 --> 01:12:41,875
Stalin!
- Sir.

990
01:12:42,083 --> 01:12:47,833
Some crook gave information about
Jamaluddin and Malik travelling with money.

991
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,500
Did you track his number?
- Done, sir.

992
01:12:51,917 --> 01:12:53,208
I can understand your situation, bhai.

993
01:12:53,417 --> 01:12:55,875
But I don't know
how can I help you in this?

994
01:12:56,083 --> 01:12:59,083
You've already done it.
What more can you do?

995
01:12:59,292 --> 01:13:01,583
You're not the Karthik of yore.

996
01:13:01,792 --> 01:13:03,417
You've become avarice.

997
01:13:03,625 --> 01:13:07,917
Jamal, I can't take all this non-sense.
- You must hear it.

998
01:13:08,125 --> 01:13:10,417
You must hear whatever I say!

999
01:13:10,625 --> 01:13:16,000
I lost my son and living underground
for what you did to me.

1000
01:13:16,208 --> 01:13:18,917
Malik was killed by police,
show your anger on them.

1001
01:13:19,125 --> 01:13:22,542
What bloody police? They're just guns.

1002
01:13:22,750 --> 01:13:23,833
You're the bullet!

1003
01:13:27,625 --> 01:13:29,125
Here they come!

1004
01:13:29,417 --> 01:13:31,125
Order a tea.
- Okay, sir.

1005
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:33,000
Then?
- What then?

1006
01:13:33,208 --> 01:13:34,167
Make two tea.

1007
01:13:34,375 --> 01:13:35,208
Will you pay for it?

1008
01:13:35,417 --> 01:13:37,708
We can get it, make it.
- From whom?

1009
01:13:37,875 --> 01:13:40,667
Sir is there, serve tea and take money.

1010
01:13:40,917 --> 01:13:42,542
Who is he?
He appears new to the area.

1011
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:43,875
Take it.

1012
01:13:44,083 --> 01:13:46,625
Give that one to him.
Go without fear.

1013
01:13:47,625 --> 01:13:50,083
What did he achieve to smoke now?

1014
01:13:51,292 --> 01:13:52,333
Take it, sir.

1015
01:13:54,875 --> 01:13:56,625
No free tea in my shop.

1016
01:13:58,042 --> 01:14:01,500
Suresh, pay him.
- Super, sir.- Okay, sir.

1017
01:14:01,708 --> 01:14:02,917
Looks like he got transferred
from Andhra.

1018
01:14:03,125 --> 01:14:04,708
He's honest.
Hey, stop man!

1019
01:14:04,875 --> 01:14:06,708
Can't I recognize if you sport a beard?

1020
01:14:06,875 --> 01:14:09,292
You had tea, bonda and vada
for over year in my shop.

1021
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:11,292
Who will pay for it?
Your father? Pay now.

1022
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:13,625
I'm unemployed, brother.
I'm searching for a job, brother.

1023
01:14:13,833 --> 01:14:16,042
Searching for a job?
What? CM's job?

1024
01:14:16,250 --> 01:14:17,875
Many are roaming here saying like that.

1025
01:14:18,042 --> 01:14:19,750
Will you pay or get your
sister married to me?

1026
01:14:19,917 --> 01:14:21,750
I've only ATM car,
I've to go to ATM...

1027
01:14:21,917 --> 01:14:23,458
With whom are you talking about ATM?
Come with me.

1028
01:14:23,667 --> 01:14:24,625
I'll show you the inventors of ATMs.

1029
01:14:24,833 --> 01:14:26,333
Dare tell me you're not
cheating me after seeing them.

1030
01:14:26,542 --> 01:14:28,500
You people cheat me like this,
so, look at this.

1031
01:14:28,750 --> 01:14:31,417
Swiping machine, Paytm,
Net banking, I've all the facilities.

1032
01:14:31,625 --> 01:14:35,000
Insert the card.
Trying to cheat Digital India Dinakaran.

1033
01:14:35,208 --> 01:14:38,875

1034
01:14:39,083 --> 01:14:40,542
Insert the card.
- Card is in home.

1035
01:14:40,750 --> 01:14:42,625
Tell your sister to bring it.
Call her.

1036
01:14:43,542 --> 01:14:44,708
Sir, Rs.20 for your tea.

1037
01:14:44,875 --> 01:14:48,542
What did you say your name is?
- Digital India Dinakaran. Why?

1038
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:51,875
He turned a baton into broom.
- Tell me, Digital India Dinakaran.

1039
01:14:52,083 --> 01:14:55,708
Did you ever give information
to police earlier?

1040
01:14:55,875 --> 01:14:56,708
To police?

1041
01:14:56,875 --> 01:15:02,625
Sir, I gave them only tea.
They never paid for it also.

1042
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:06,292
How do you know Jamaluddin?
- Who is he?

1043
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:09,125
Aasif Biryani shop owner?

1044
01:15:09,333 --> 01:15:12,292
Hey, don't test my patience!
- Am I?

1045
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:14,917
How do you know about Jamaluddin
was going with money?

1046
01:15:15,125 --> 01:15:16,375
How are you connected to him?

1047
01:15:16,583 --> 01:15:18,375
I swear, I don't know who he is!

1048
01:15:18,583 --> 01:15:20,417
A palmist came to my shop.

1049
01:15:20,625 --> 01:15:22,708
He said my life will turn
topsy-turvy, sir.

1050
01:15:22,875 --> 01:15:24,792
Then, I realised you hanged
my upside down to thrash.

1051
01:15:24,917 --> 01:15:26,917
What the hell are you saying?
- I said about you thrashing me.

1052
01:15:27,125 --> 01:15:29,792
Trust me, I don't know who he is!

1053
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:31,542
One fine day...

1054
01:15:31,750 --> 01:15:33,042
I was in my shop.

1055
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:34,542
A girl came riding bike.

1056
01:15:34,750 --> 01:15:38,875
I'm standing before her..
I'm enchanted by her...

1057
01:15:39,083 --> 01:15:41,458
I got myself trapped willingly...
I'm going after her...

1058
01:15:41,667 --> 01:15:43,542
I'm dying before her...

1059
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:47,875
I'm standing before her..
I'm enchanted by her...

1060
01:15:48,083 --> 01:15:50,458
I got myself trapped willingly...
I'm going after her...

1061
01:15:50,667 --> 01:15:52,125
I'm dying before her...

1062
01:15:52,333 --> 01:15:54,208
Though there are many girls in town...

1063
01:15:54,417 --> 01:15:56,833
You're the luckiest girl in town...

1064
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,250
I got myself trapped willingly...
I'm stuttering because of you...

1065
01:15:59,458 --> 01:16:01,083
Why is she coming to my shop?

1066
01:16:02,708 --> 01:16:03,708
Hi dear!

1067
01:16:03,875 --> 01:16:05,125
Me?
- Yeah, baby.

1068
01:16:05,333 --> 01:16:07,000
I'm like hero but call me as baby.

1069
01:16:07,208 --> 01:16:08,875
Hey, clear out boys.

1070
01:16:09,083 --> 01:16:09,833
Then...

1071
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:15,292
I'm of marriageable age now...

1072
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:17,000
Can I wait for you?

1073
01:16:17,208 --> 01:16:18,708
Can I chat with you?

1074
01:16:18,875 --> 01:16:22,375
I wish to live with you...

1075
01:16:22,583 --> 01:16:23,708
You're very naughty.

1076
01:16:23,875 --> 01:16:25,667
Will you ride bike like that
on speed breakers?

1077
01:16:28,333 --> 01:16:29,083
Come, baby.

1078
01:16:29,292 --> 01:16:30,750
Ladies first please.

1079
01:16:30,917 --> 01:16:31,708
Mad girl!

1080
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:33,708
Excuse me.
- Tell me.

1081
01:16:33,875 --> 01:16:35,917
Can you make a phone call for me?

1082
01:16:36,125 --> 01:16:39,542
I can murder anyone for you,
won't I make a phone call for you?

1083
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:41,083
Thank you, baby.

1084
01:16:41,292 --> 01:16:43,708
Just repeat whatever I say!
Okay.

1085
01:16:43,875 --> 01:16:44,708
May I?

1086
01:16:44,875 --> 01:16:46,500
Okay.
- I'll speak in 'Mottai' Rajendran's voice.

1087
01:16:48,875 --> 01:16:51,125
Hello, I'm Markandeyan here.

1088
01:16:53,583 --> 01:16:56,292
Sir, she gave me a number.

1089
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:57,708
She asked me to speak.

1090
01:16:57,875 --> 01:16:58,917
I did.

1091
01:16:59,125 --> 01:17:01,917
I don't know with
whom I talked and why!

1092
01:17:02,167 --> 01:17:03,333
I promise on your mother, sir.

1093
01:17:03,542 --> 01:17:06,500
How could I know that bloody
woman get me into trouble?

1094
01:17:06,708 --> 01:17:10,083
How was she to look?
Can you recognise her?

1095
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:14,292
Her face is just like his face.

1096
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:16,083
I'll inform I see her again.

1097
01:17:16,292 --> 01:17:19,125
Foreigner roam around
with open shirt, right?

1098
01:17:19,333 --> 01:17:20,917
She was roaming just like them, sir.

1099
01:17:21,125 --> 01:17:22,500
She came riding a Commando bike.

1100
01:17:22,708 --> 01:17:25,542
Sir, please give me water near your leg.
I'm thirsty.

1101
01:17:25,750 --> 01:17:26,708
New to the station?

1102
01:17:26,875 --> 01:17:28,000
Open Diya's WhatsApp status photo.

1103
01:17:28,208 --> 01:17:30,542
Open it quickly, sir is asking, right?

1104
01:17:33,083 --> 01:17:34,750
See, if she's the girl.
- Lift it up!

1105
01:17:34,917 --> 01:17:38,750
Sir, that's her!
This is the girl!

1106
01:17:38,875 --> 01:17:39,917
Catch her, sir.

1107
01:17:40,125 --> 01:17:41,500
Why is he standing there?

1108
01:17:41,667 --> 01:17:44,083
Why did Diya gave info on Jamaluddin?

1109
01:17:44,292 --> 01:17:45,500
You're police, right? Find it.

1110
01:17:45,708 --> 01:17:47,333
I'll shove this into you.
- Keep quiet.

1111
01:17:47,542 --> 01:17:48,542
I told the truth.

1112
01:17:48,750 --> 01:17:50,000
I'm also thinking about that only.

1113
01:17:50,208 --> 01:17:51,708
If my assumption is right,

1114
01:17:51,875 --> 01:17:55,833
I'm sure she has connection
with the mole in our department.

1115
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,833
Maheswari!
- Go, sir is calling you, right?

1116
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:58,708
Sir!

1117
01:17:58,875 --> 01:18:00,125
Send him home.
- Okay, sir.

1118
01:18:00,333 --> 01:18:02,333
He must come on call.
- Okay, sir.

1119
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:05,417
Sir, I'll go home by evening.

1120
01:18:05,625 --> 01:18:07,875
Give me phone number,
I'll call someone from your family.

1121
01:18:08,083 --> 01:18:10,000
Madam!
- Eh?

1122
01:18:10,208 --> 01:18:12,208
I don't have anyone, madam.

1123
01:18:12,417 --> 01:18:13,625
I'm an orphan!

1124
01:18:13,833 --> 01:18:15,333
If you buy a half bottle for me.

1125
01:18:15,542 --> 01:18:18,708
I'll have and sleep
in verandah, madam.

1126
01:18:18,875 --> 01:18:20,417
I'll not throw up, madam.
Please...

1127
01:18:28,333 --> 01:18:30,417
Having coffee?
Have it, please.

1128
01:18:30,625 --> 01:18:32,500
Enjoy the taste and flavour!

1129
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:34,208
It could be your last coffee.

1130
01:18:34,375 --> 01:18:37,458
What? Delivering punch dialogue!

1131
01:18:37,667 --> 01:18:40,000
I don't get scared so easily.

1132
01:18:40,208 --> 01:18:44,083
I know, you're very courageous girl.
I know it very well.

1133
01:18:44,292 --> 01:18:45,708
If not after betraying me,

1134
01:18:45,917 --> 01:18:49,208
how can you sit in hotel
coolly and order food?

1135
01:18:49,375 --> 01:18:53,500
Why? Should I fast for your son's death?

1136
01:18:56,625 --> 01:18:59,833
You're as arrogant as your boss.

1137
01:19:00,042 --> 01:19:01,917
You'll also meet the
same end as he had.

1138
01:19:02,833 --> 01:19:03,583
Okay.

1139
01:19:03,792 --> 01:19:05,375
Leave me!

1140
01:19:05,583 --> 01:19:06,333
Come I say!

1141
01:19:07,583 --> 01:19:09,583
Calling from Newton Coffee Shop, sir.

1142
01:19:28,375 --> 01:19:30,000
Boys, get her.

1143
01:19:33,125 --> 01:19:34,875
Hey, leave me I say!

1144
01:19:35,625 --> 01:19:37,833
Hey, leave her to me.

1145
01:19:38,042 --> 01:19:41,875
If you think of saving her,
no one can save you.

1146
01:19:42,083 --> 01:19:45,333
Are you also here to kill her?

1147
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:47,833
Looks like you've many villains.

1148
01:19:48,042 --> 01:19:49,542
Tell me, in whose hands
you wish to die?

1149
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:52,708
Me or him?

1150
01:19:53,042 --> 01:19:54,042
Tell me.

1151
01:19:54,250 --> 01:19:55,542
Where's the money
you stole from my home?

1152
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:57,542
Tell him!
He's asking you, right?

1153
01:19:57,750 --> 01:20:00,250
What? Did you steal from his house?

1154
01:20:00,417 --> 01:20:04,125
So, you're the Satan
who stole my money?

1155
01:20:04,333 --> 01:20:09,333
I was searching for you only.
I took all your money.

1156
01:20:09,708 --> 01:20:13,833
But to save you,
she got me caught by police.

1157
01:20:14,083 --> 01:20:16,333
You're the man responsible
for all my troubles.

1158
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:17,792
I must kill you first.

1159
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,125
Come...come on.

1160
01:20:19,333 --> 01:20:20,542
I was also searching for you only.

1161
01:20:20,750 --> 01:20:23,833
Boys, leave her.
Kill him first!

1162
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,458
Sakthi! Let's go away from here.

1163
01:20:42,667 --> 01:20:44,583
He's running away.
- Come I say!

1164
01:20:51,792 --> 01:20:53,375
Why are you talking like a mad man?

1165
01:20:53,583 --> 01:20:57,000
Diya is not Jagan to support you blindly.

1166
01:20:57,208 --> 01:21:00,208
This case isn't good for
her now or in future too.

1167
01:21:00,375 --> 01:21:01,792
She got into more trouble
because of you.

1168
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,833
She's paying price for her sins.

1169
01:21:04,042 --> 01:21:05,250
She's not facing problem
because of me.

1170
01:21:05,417 --> 01:21:06,833
If she was concerned
about her job only.

1171
01:21:07,042 --> 01:21:08,208
We wouldn't be talking here now.

1172
01:21:08,375 --> 01:21:12,583
After listening patiently your story,
she chided me for making you a thief.

1173
01:21:12,792 --> 01:21:14,208
But you...?

1174
01:21:15,792 --> 01:21:16,917
Okay, buddy.

1175
01:21:17,125 --> 01:21:21,958
I myself feel on supporting her
as if I'm PRO Diamond Babu.

1176
01:21:22,167 --> 01:21:25,000
But I said what I wanted to.
Think and decide yourself.

1177
01:21:25,208 --> 01:21:25,917
Okay?

1178
01:21:35,458 --> 01:21:37,792
Are you here again to kill me?

1179
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:38,917
Dare touch me!

1180
01:21:39,125 --> 01:21:41,167
Sorry and thanks.
- What?

1181
01:21:41,333 --> 01:21:43,292
Sorry for coming to kill you.

1182
01:21:43,708 --> 01:21:45,208
Thanks for saving me.

1183
01:21:45,375 --> 01:21:47,583
You'll never face any problem from me.

1184
01:21:49,042 --> 01:21:49,708
Hello!

1185
01:21:51,625 --> 01:21:53,167
Shall we have a coffee together?

1186
01:21:55,125 --> 01:21:58,833
Can I know why you saved me
after knowing my past?

1187
01:21:59,042 --> 01:22:01,500
No man can impress me.
Even my dad also.

1188
01:22:01,708 --> 01:22:04,208
Like they show in films,
listening to sentimental story,

1189
01:22:04,375 --> 01:22:05,375
getting impressed and
shedding few tears,

1190
01:22:05,583 --> 01:22:09,583
falling in love,
this isn't anything stupid like that.

1191
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:12,500
As a detective,
I've to study a lot of characters.

1192
01:22:12,708 --> 01:22:16,292
A poisonous spider bite turned
a man into Spiderman.

1193
01:22:16,458 --> 01:22:19,208
Nuclear radiation turned
a man into X-Man.

1194
01:22:19,375 --> 01:22:21,125
This is Hollywood story.

1195
01:22:21,333 --> 01:22:24,083
But you...you're a real
interesting character.

1196
01:22:24,292 --> 01:22:28,375
In philosophy, there's a disease
behind every super hero.

1197
01:22:28,542 --> 01:22:29,542
There's sorrow!

1198
01:22:29,750 --> 01:22:30,917
You too are like that only.

1199
01:22:31,125 --> 01:22:33,333
I'm unable to see you as a criminal.

1200
01:22:34,542 --> 01:22:36,458
I'm seeing you as a patient.

1201
01:22:36,667 --> 01:22:38,833
If you weren't affected
with this disease,

1202
01:22:39,042 --> 01:22:41,500
for your talent,
what all you would've achieved,

1203
01:22:41,708 --> 01:22:43,125
I had imagined that also.

1204
01:22:43,333 --> 01:22:46,042
May be that's the reason I saved you.

1205
01:22:46,250 --> 01:22:47,250
Oh God!

1206
01:22:47,417 --> 01:22:50,125
Can you analyze so much
in just one meeting?

1207
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:52,500
Indeed you're a great detective.

1208
01:22:52,708 --> 01:22:53,833
Thank you.

1209
01:23:16,458 --> 01:23:20,792
Most dangerous lady villain
is next to me...

1210
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:25,208
She searched for me sleepless
to become my friend...

1211
01:23:25,375 --> 01:23:29,917
Praised my talent,
loved my loneliness...

1212
01:23:30,125 --> 01:23:35,125
She breezed into my life
by mistake...

1213
01:23:53,125 --> 01:23:57,375
I'm a wild stream without
any check dam...

1214
01:23:57,625 --> 01:24:01,958
I stopped for a while
seeing you without arms...

1215
01:24:02,167 --> 01:24:06,500
I'm a woman who argues vociferously...

1216
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:11,083
I'm like Alladin's genie
to fulfill wishes...

1217
01:24:11,292 --> 01:24:15,583
Life fell into sorrows by mistake,
it'll leave you in near future...

1218
01:24:15,792 --> 01:24:20,375
Can your eyes sleep
forgetting yourself?

1219
01:24:20,583 --> 01:24:22,458
Enough of the hell
you had been through...

1220
01:24:22,667 --> 01:24:24,792
Future is bright with hope...

1221
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:28,208
You'll come out darkness into light...

1222
01:24:28,375 --> 01:24:30,833
If I call you to a place,
will you come, Sakthi?

1223
01:24:31,125 --> 01:24:33,083
Yeah! Where?

1224
01:24:33,125 --> 01:24:35,083
Commonly known as Kleptomania.

1225
01:24:35,417 --> 01:24:37,458
But each one has a different issue.

1226
01:24:38,083 --> 01:24:41,417
Majority of them are interested
in few things only.

1227
01:24:41,625 --> 01:24:45,417
If there's anything more
worth next to it or cash,

1228
01:24:45,625 --> 01:24:46,667
they never care for it.

1229
01:24:46,875 --> 01:24:51,833
Unique thing about them
is to get the thing they like,

1230
01:24:52,042 --> 01:24:53,292
they'll go to any length to achieve it.

1231
01:24:53,458 --> 01:24:54,958
They'll take any risk.

1232
01:24:55,167 --> 01:24:58,333
I've seen many cases in your clinic.

1233
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:00,917
But never seen any case like him.

1234
01:25:01,125 --> 01:25:03,542
If body has hundred disease,
mind has thousand.

1235
01:25:03,750 --> 01:25:07,833
Reason for Sakthi's problem is
her mother not having money,

1236
01:25:08,042 --> 01:25:09,542
and the problems he faced
in his childhood,

1237
01:25:09,750 --> 01:25:11,250
life in juvenile home,

1238
01:25:11,417 --> 01:25:13,625
there are many things that
had affected him psychologically,

1239
01:25:13,833 --> 01:25:17,125
may be genetic disorder too.

1240
01:25:17,333 --> 01:25:19,542
Neither he spends
nor gives to anyone,

1241
01:25:19,750 --> 01:25:21,417
he stashes in room to see and enjoy it,

1242
01:25:21,625 --> 01:25:22,667
I'm asking you,
what's the reason for it?

1243
01:25:22,875 --> 01:25:26,458
The question why he's not spending
the money is for you only.

1244
01:25:26,667 --> 01:25:27,625
It never comes into his mind.

1245
01:25:27,833 --> 01:25:29,625
Just like him there was
a man in Russia.

1246
01:25:29,833 --> 01:25:31,125
Ivan Luciv, a billionaire.

1247
01:25:31,333 --> 01:25:35,125
He stole gold, tin, iron and
dumped in his home.

1248
01:25:35,333 --> 01:25:37,500
When police asked him,
why did he do it?

1249
01:25:37,708 --> 01:25:39,042
He wasn't able to answer them.

1250
01:25:39,250 --> 01:25:41,292
Sakthi's case is also like him.

1251
01:25:41,458 --> 01:25:45,542
When he feels like stealing,
he's like a wild elephant then.

1252
01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:47,417
No one can control him.

1253
01:25:47,625 --> 01:25:51,833
He's a normal man only after
he steals the money.

1254
01:25:52,042 --> 01:25:52,750
Sakthi!

1255
01:25:53,750 --> 01:25:56,417
Can you make him normal or not?

1256
01:25:56,625 --> 01:25:59,375
Why not? Can cure him 90%.

1257
01:25:59,583 --> 01:26:02,000
You always want to
study characters, right?

1258
01:26:02,208 --> 01:26:03,917
You got perfect material.

1259
01:26:04,125 --> 01:26:06,958
Hold him tightly, I'll give you tips.

1260
01:26:07,167 --> 01:26:10,042
Keep him closely and study him well.

1261
01:26:20,333 --> 01:26:21,917
I'm with Sakthi for the last 15 days.

1262
01:26:22,125 --> 01:26:22,958
Now, he doesn't have any problem.

1263
01:26:23,167 --> 01:26:26,250
As a solution for his problem,
engage him in other activities.

1264
01:26:26,458 --> 01:26:29,667
Particularly, divert his mind from money.

1265
01:26:29,875 --> 01:26:34,042
I'm an adventure
without anything pleasant...

1266
01:26:34,208 --> 01:26:38,542
I found new hope in
your friendship, my dear...

1267
01:26:38,750 --> 01:26:43,125
I'm a trouble-free cloud...

1268
01:26:43,292 --> 01:26:47,875
My dear, I melted in your warmth...

1269
01:26:48,042 --> 01:26:50,667
In my loneliness...
in my affected heart...

1270
01:26:50,875 --> 01:26:52,042
Will you do if I tell you something?
- Come on, tell me.

1271
01:26:52,208 --> 01:26:53,333
Quit smoking.

1272
01:26:53,542 --> 01:26:56,750
First time I feel change in my life...

1273
01:26:56,958 --> 01:27:01,375
A passing cloud is descending
on earth...

1274
01:27:01,583 --> 01:27:06,042
You're the earth that
takes it into its lap...

1275
01:27:06,208 --> 01:27:10,458
Most dangerous lady villain
is next to me...

1276
01:27:10,667 --> 01:27:15,042
She searched for me sleepless
to become my friend...

1277
01:27:15,208 --> 01:27:20,292
She thinks I'm a thief...

1278
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:24,250
Hey, if you both marry,
please your son after me.

1279
01:27:24,458 --> 01:27:28,375
I read your heart...
I loved your loneliness...

1280
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:33,625
I brought gifts for you...

1281
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:41,375
Ensure this report reaches
the station at the earliest.

1282
01:27:41,583 --> 01:27:43,042
Okay, sir.
- Okay?- Sure.

1283
01:27:46,208 --> 01:27:46,958
Sir!

1284
01:27:47,375 --> 01:27:49,292
You wanted someone
to track Aadhar, right?

1285
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:51,125
He's the guy.
- Yes, sir.

1286
01:27:51,292 --> 01:27:56,542
There's an assumption that one man
is involved in 3 recent robberies.

1287
01:27:56,750 --> 01:27:58,083
But no proof.

1288
01:27:58,250 --> 01:28:02,625
With the forensic report of 3 incidents,

1289
01:28:02,833 --> 01:28:05,750
check if there are any similarities
between the fingerprints.

1290
01:28:05,958 --> 01:28:08,750
If you find any similarity,
match it with Aadhar.

1291
01:28:08,958 --> 01:28:11,083
Get the details about the person.

1292
01:28:12,208 --> 01:28:13,667
Today is no moon day,
so, just a beer for Justin.

1293
01:28:13,875 --> 01:28:16,542
He won't drink anything.
Then, one half boil.

1294
01:28:18,417 --> 01:28:20,542
Buddy!

1295
01:28:20,917 --> 01:28:23,917
I thought you were the only child
on earth to desire money.

1296
01:28:24,125 --> 01:28:26,208
Look at him,
I think he's worse than you.

1297
01:28:26,375 --> 01:28:27,417
Look at him.

1298
01:28:29,375 --> 01:28:32,458
Do one thing, adopt that child.

1299
01:28:33,708 --> 01:28:34,875
Shall I inquire about the child?

1300
01:28:36,958 --> 01:28:39,125
Excuse me sir,
lift is outside near stairs.

1301
01:28:40,125 --> 01:28:41,083
How is it? Super?

1302
01:28:41,250 --> 01:28:42,958
Give it to me,
don't see the next video.

1303
01:28:43,167 --> 01:28:44,083
If you see, you'll go berserk.

1304
01:28:44,250 --> 01:28:45,125
With tension.

1305
01:28:47,083 --> 01:28:48,833
Sorry sir, there's no match.

1306
01:28:54,333 --> 01:28:55,750
Elango!
- Sir!

1307
01:28:55,958 --> 01:29:01,333
I told you match phone numbers
of dept. people with Diya's phone numbers.

1308
01:29:01,542 --> 01:29:03,542
Did you check it?
- It's ready, sir.

1309
01:29:05,417 --> 01:29:09,625
All these phone numbers belong to
police who were in contact with Diya.

1310
01:29:09,833 --> 01:29:10,625
Okay.

1311
01:29:10,833 --> 01:29:11,917
This is atrocious, sir.

1312
01:29:12,125 --> 01:29:14,083
Looks like our dept. officers
will not spare any girl.

1313
01:29:14,250 --> 01:29:16,125
So many officers are in contact with her.

1314
01:29:17,375 --> 01:29:22,083
Check who calls Diya quite often.
Okay, sir.

1315
01:29:23,542 --> 01:29:26,667
Sir, let's arrest and
inquire them using third degree.

1316
01:29:26,875 --> 01:29:29,208
I may use bad word.

1317
01:29:29,417 --> 01:29:30,750
All are police officers.

1318
01:29:30,958 --> 01:29:35,042
Let's see tower sync using
location parameter.

1319
01:29:35,208 --> 01:29:36,792
I didn't get you.

1320
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:41,208
Can't be sure all these numbers are
in contact with Diya on phone only.

1321
01:29:41,417 --> 01:29:45,500
If we use tower sync option to check
who met her personally quite often.

1322
01:29:45,708 --> 01:29:48,083
There's a chance of going
to the next level, sir.

1323
01:29:48,250 --> 01:29:49,542
Yes, carry on.

1324
01:29:50,375 --> 01:29:52,333
Hello...hello...control room?

1325
01:29:52,542 --> 01:29:53,458
Yes, control room.
Tell me.

1326
01:29:53,667 --> 01:29:56,167
I'm calling from a bar near
new bridge in Maduravoyal.

1327
01:29:56,333 --> 01:29:57,750
I'm a security guard with IDCI bank.

1328
01:29:57,958 --> 01:30:02,042
I've already told police about
a suspect in inquiry, sir.

1329
01:30:02,208 --> 01:30:04,625
He's now in this bar, sir.
Come quickly, sir.

1330
01:30:04,833 --> 01:30:05,833
Sir!

1331
01:30:12,458 --> 01:30:13,417
Sakthi!

1332
01:30:14,458 --> 01:30:15,458
Hey Sakthi!

1333
01:30:26,792 --> 01:30:28,167
What's happening to you?

1334
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:30,167
Can you hear me?

1335
01:30:31,083 --> 01:30:32,167
Hey Sakthi!

1336
01:30:32,417 --> 01:30:34,667
Sakthi, control yourself.

1337
01:30:34,875 --> 01:30:36,000
Hey Sakthi!

1338
01:30:50,958 --> 01:30:51,583
Buddy!

1339
01:30:54,125 --> 01:30:55,458
Hey...hey...

1340
01:30:56,250 --> 01:30:57,667
We're in public, please listen to me.

1341
01:30:57,875 --> 01:31:00,792
Sakthi, please.
Think what doctor told you!

1342
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,000
Control yourself.

1343
01:31:02,583 --> 01:31:04,000
Hey...hey...

1344
01:31:04,167 --> 01:31:05,417
No!

1345
01:31:07,667 --> 01:31:08,458
Hey!

1346
01:31:11,208 --> 01:31:12,458
Sakthi!

1347
01:31:23,208 --> 01:31:24,833
Hey, he's taking away cash.

1348
01:31:28,083 --> 01:31:29,583
Hey, close the shed.

1349
01:32:39,917 --> 01:32:43,042
I was at peace thinking
you're fine with Diya's treatment.

1350
01:32:43,208 --> 01:32:45,833
Nobody can reform you in this life.

1351
01:32:47,417 --> 01:32:50,375
If she comes to know this matter,
she's a terror!

1352
01:32:50,583 --> 01:32:52,708
Nobody knows what she would do!

1353
01:32:52,958 --> 01:32:54,583
I've warned you, do as you please.

1354
01:33:09,625 --> 01:33:10,292
Hello!

1355
01:33:10,458 --> 01:33:11,917
Tell me, Diya.

1356
01:33:12,125 --> 01:33:14,458
What happened?
Why didn't you answer my phone?

1357
01:33:14,667 --> 01:33:16,833
Why your voice is different?
Any problem?

1358
01:33:18,417 --> 01:33:19,167
Hello...

1359
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:21,000
Hey...hello...

1360
01:33:21,167 --> 01:33:22,083
Nothing.

1361
01:33:22,250 --> 01:33:24,250
No, you're not normal.

1362
01:33:24,458 --> 01:33:25,875
You're hiding something from me.

1363
01:33:26,083 --> 01:33:27,417
I'm sure.

1364
01:33:45,250 --> 01:33:46,542
What the hell were you doing here?

1365
01:33:46,917 --> 01:33:48,708
A man has come and
looted cash publicly.

1366
01:33:48,917 --> 01:33:50,625
Resign police job and work elsewhere.

1367
01:33:50,833 --> 01:33:52,542
If press comes to know this...
- Sir!

1368
01:33:54,292 --> 01:33:55,417
Look here, sir.

1369
01:34:06,542 --> 01:34:07,667
Watchman is here.
- Okay, sir.

1370
01:34:07,875 --> 01:34:09,292
Please tell him what you saw.

1371
01:34:09,958 --> 01:34:12,750
You saw his face, right?
Describe it, he'll draw it.

1372
01:34:12,958 --> 01:34:15,417
Eyes are little smaller in size, sir.

1373
01:34:15,625 --> 01:34:17,667
Like this?
- No, sir.

1374
01:34:17,833 --> 01:34:18,417
Change.

1375
01:34:18,625 --> 01:34:19,667
Round, sir.

1376
01:34:20,375 --> 01:34:21,833
Like this?
- No.

1377
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:22,958
Not like this, sir.

1378
01:34:23,375 --> 01:34:25,417
Light...trimmed beard.

1379
01:34:25,625 --> 01:34:27,833
Hair is combed to back.

1380
01:34:28,042 --> 01:34:29,417
Like this?
- Yes, sir.

1381
01:35:12,875 --> 01:35:13,875
What happened?

1382
01:35:14,083 --> 01:35:16,875
You won't go away from me, right Diya?

1383
01:35:17,542 --> 01:35:19,083
Why would I leave you?

1384
01:35:19,333 --> 01:35:20,625
I don't get you.

1385
01:35:20,833 --> 01:35:24,875
My mother told me so many times
but I couldn't stop robbing.

1386
01:35:25,083 --> 01:35:26,875
I robbed without caring her advice.

1387
01:35:27,208 --> 01:35:29,208
So, I lost her.

1388
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:35,875
But now, though you don't
have any relationship with me,

1389
01:35:36,083 --> 01:35:37,542
you're helping me,

1390
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:41,208
I don't have trust in myself,

1391
01:35:43,083 --> 01:35:45,083
I'm unable to give up
this robbing habit,

1392
01:35:45,875 --> 01:35:48,417
I fear losing you too
like I lost my mother.

1393
01:35:52,125 --> 01:35:54,667
If you think Diya is part of your life.

1394
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,417
I'm sure you'll never rob again.

1395
01:35:58,042 --> 01:36:02,417
Whenever you get feeling of robbing,
you must think about me only.

1396
01:36:22,333 --> 01:36:23,333
Sir, good morning.

1397
01:36:23,542 --> 01:36:27,292
Yesterday tracking Diya's number,
found information about spy, sir.

1398
01:36:34,792 --> 01:36:37,042
Sir, I know him very well.

1399
01:36:37,208 --> 01:36:39,042
He works in crime money division.

1400
01:36:39,208 --> 01:36:42,042
All the robberies happened with
getting information from him, sir.

1401
01:36:42,208 --> 01:36:44,042
Sir...shall we arrest him?

1402
01:36:44,208 --> 01:36:48,000
No, keep this a secret
till I tell you.

1403
01:36:49,250 --> 01:36:50,292
Why sir?

1404
01:36:50,500 --> 01:36:51,833
Just follow my order.

1405
01:37:10,625 --> 01:37:12,208
Hello, tell me.
- Greetings, sir.

1406
01:37:12,417 --> 01:37:16,792
We've made a sketch of the accused
with security man's description.

1407
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,958
I've forwarded it to you in WhatsApp.
Please take a look.

1408
01:37:20,167 --> 01:37:21,125
Okay, I'll see.

1409
01:37:41,083 --> 01:37:44,083
Sakthi, I think Manickavasagam
has tracked us.

1410
01:37:44,250 --> 01:37:45,542
What are you saying?

1411
01:37:45,750 --> 01:37:47,208
Don't turn back, sit as you're now.

1412
01:37:47,417 --> 01:37:50,125
He's following us on bike.

1413
01:37:51,667 --> 01:37:52,958
Please listen to me carefully.

1414
01:37:53,167 --> 01:37:54,667
I'll drop you somewhere in a market.

1415
01:37:54,875 --> 01:37:56,625
Escape merging into crowd.
Okay?

1416
01:37:56,833 --> 01:37:57,917
Don't come to room till I ask you.

1417
01:37:58,125 --> 01:38:00,208
Do you want me to run away
leaving you alone?

1418
01:38:00,417 --> 01:38:02,042
Am I so cheap? Carry on.

1419
01:38:02,083 --> 01:38:04,917
No, I'm from his dept.
He won't harm me.

1420
01:38:05,125 --> 01:38:07,417
Even then, no need,
just carry on.

1421
01:38:10,083 --> 01:38:11,667
Take left...left.

1422
01:38:14,125 --> 01:38:15,625
Take sudden turn.

1423
01:38:25,167 --> 01:38:27,417
Shit, we got caught, buddy.

1424
01:38:31,208 --> 01:38:32,542
Hey, get down!

1425
01:38:32,750 --> 01:38:33,458
Get down!

1426
01:38:44,792 --> 01:38:45,417
Diya!

1427
01:38:46,208 --> 01:38:47,375
Get out!

1428
01:38:48,167 --> 01:38:50,667
What happened?
- Get out!

1429
01:38:50,875 --> 01:38:53,375
What happened?
- I said get out!

1430
01:38:55,625 --> 01:38:57,583
What's this madness?

1431
01:38:57,792 --> 01:39:02,792
Yes, I tried to make you human.
I'm really mad.

1432
01:39:06,625 --> 01:39:08,000
Leave me alone, Sakthi.

1433
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,500
For God's sake, leave me alone.

1434
01:39:12,375 --> 01:39:14,167
I'll not disturb you again in life.

1435
01:39:14,375 --> 01:39:16,583
You can live your life as you like.

1436
01:39:17,208 --> 01:39:18,792
Please don't come to me again.

1437
01:39:19,583 --> 01:39:20,833
Am I acting?

1438
01:39:21,042 --> 01:39:23,417
What's this stupid behaviour?
What has happened now?

1439
01:39:23,625 --> 01:39:26,917
You're perfectly alright.
I'm misbehaving, right?

1440
01:39:28,625 --> 01:39:31,000
I gave you treatment
turned a new leaf in your life.

1441
01:39:31,167 --> 01:39:34,375
I wanted to bring you out of the
crimes you had committed earlier.

1442
01:39:34,583 --> 01:39:36,417
That's misbehaviour.

1443
01:39:36,625 --> 01:39:37,792
I'm really mad.

1444
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:38,833
I can understand.

1445
01:39:39,042 --> 01:39:43,583
I've never had any feelings
for anyone till now.

1446
01:39:43,917 --> 01:39:45,792
I thought you'd come out
of your problem.

1447
01:39:47,250 --> 01:39:48,708
I gave myself to you.

1448
01:39:49,083 --> 01:39:51,833
First time I realised
I'm girl because of you.

1449
01:39:52,042 --> 01:39:57,208
I thought if you find a girl for yourself,
I let you go alone with great hope.

1450
01:39:57,417 --> 01:39:59,042
You dashed it in a minute.

1451
01:39:59,208 --> 01:40:01,208
What has happened now?

1452
01:40:01,417 --> 01:40:03,375
I'm still after you as your Sakthi.

1453
01:40:03,583 --> 01:40:06,292
You...? Are you my Sakthi?

1454
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:11,458
You turned approver as the robber
with Manickavasagam and come to me here.

1455
01:40:11,667 --> 01:40:13,500
Are you my Sakthi?

1456
01:40:13,583 --> 01:40:15,708
Who told you? Jagan?

1457
01:40:15,917 --> 01:40:17,667
No need for anyone to tell me.

1458
01:40:17,875 --> 01:40:22,417
I found who you are,
can't I find what you did just now?

1459
01:40:22,625 --> 01:40:23,958
You're a cheat!

1460
01:40:24,792 --> 01:40:25,958
You're a cheat!

1461
01:40:30,667 --> 01:40:32,583
I never cried in my life.

1462
01:40:32,792 --> 01:40:35,125
Now...right now...

1463
01:40:35,417 --> 01:40:37,833
I trusted you blindly,
I got cheated and I'm in tears.

1464
01:40:38,042 --> 01:40:41,542
It's your foolishness to cry
without knowing the truth.

1465
01:40:42,125 --> 01:40:43,583
I'll tell you what had happened there!

1466
01:40:44,042 --> 01:40:46,125
Believe it or not!

1467
01:40:50,125 --> 01:40:52,625
Why did you bring us here
to a remote place?

1468
01:40:52,833 --> 01:40:56,000
Robber Sakthi involved in
many mega robberies!

1469
01:40:56,167 --> 01:41:00,625
Along with his accomplice Jagan
were shot dead near pond!

1470
01:41:00,833 --> 01:41:03,625
That's tomorrow's newspaper headline!

1471
01:41:06,458 --> 01:41:07,875
What are you looking at?

1472
01:41:08,083 --> 01:41:09,625
We almost give our life
to find the criminal.

1473
01:41:09,833 --> 01:41:10,875
We'll present them in court.

1474
01:41:11,083 --> 01:41:13,833
You'll bring a lawyer from Delhi,
get bail very easily,

1475
01:41:14,042 --> 01:41:17,042
come out casually, eat biryani
and happily roam outside, right?

1476
01:41:17,208 --> 01:41:19,500
We must watch the fun silently.

1477
01:41:19,875 --> 01:41:25,208
No criminal must think about robbing
after seeing your dead bodies.

1478
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,500
Come on, tell me.

1479
01:41:31,167 --> 01:41:31,958
What?

1480
01:41:32,458 --> 01:41:34,125
Why are you still in department?

1481
01:41:34,292 --> 01:41:36,042
Why not become prostitutes
in a brothel house?

1482
01:41:36,208 --> 01:41:37,125
Oh no!

1483
01:41:40,458 --> 01:41:42,000
People like you can be shot dead easily.

1484
01:41:42,167 --> 01:41:43,708
But I don't know
what to do with these guys!

1485
01:41:43,917 --> 01:41:46,167
You meet them and come leisurely,
we'll wait for you here, sir.

1486
01:41:46,375 --> 01:41:47,083
Hey!

1487
01:41:47,250 --> 01:41:50,375
I asked if there's any problem
in our dept., sir.

1488
01:41:52,083 --> 01:41:53,625
He's a state Minister.

1489
01:41:54,208 --> 01:41:57,833
Using his reach with Central Govt.,
he has dealings with some banks,

1490
01:41:58,167 --> 01:42:03,042
he made crores stealing few paise
from people's accounts in those banks,

1491
01:42:03,208 --> 01:42:04,792
and invests that money in share market,

1492
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:10,042
then he dumps it in his proxy businesses
like beer companies and TV channels.

1493
01:42:10,208 --> 01:42:14,167
Now, to become CM,
to buy MLA's support with money,

1494
01:42:14,375 --> 01:42:16,167
he has ready cash running
into several hundreds of crores.

1495
01:42:16,375 --> 01:42:18,167
There's only one way to stop
that fraudster.

1496
01:42:18,375 --> 01:42:23,083
To capture the money he has stashed
and stop MLA's from supporting him.

1497
01:42:23,542 --> 01:42:29,000
I made a plan for it, but few police officer
betrayed by leaking it to Minister.

1498
01:42:29,167 --> 01:42:33,625
They blocked me from making
my next move, bloody cheap cops!

1499
01:42:38,917 --> 01:42:40,417
I'll save people's money.

1500
01:42:41,917 --> 01:42:42,625
What?

1501
01:42:43,625 --> 01:42:44,833
Will you save it?

1502
01:42:45,292 --> 01:42:46,250
Yes.

1503
01:42:46,458 --> 01:42:49,833
The money which police failed to save,
I'll bring it back.

1504
01:42:50,042 --> 01:42:52,167
Why get into unnecessary trouble?

1505
01:42:52,375 --> 01:42:55,333
New plan to escape from me?

1506
01:42:55,542 --> 01:42:58,333
If I had such a plan,
my approach would've been different.

1507
01:42:58,542 --> 01:43:01,917
Not only that,
I'm not doing this job for free.

1508
01:43:02,125 --> 01:43:02,792
Then?

1509
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:06,667
You'll get the cash
only on accepting my deal.

1510
01:43:06,875 --> 01:43:07,792
What are you looking at?

1511
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,167
We'll risk our life to get public money,

1512
01:43:10,375 --> 01:43:12,958
will you get promotion
and happily enjoy your biryani!

1513
01:43:13,167 --> 01:43:15,208
I like this counter comment.
Tell me your deal.

1514
01:43:15,417 --> 01:43:16,667
Me, Jagan and Diya!

1515
01:43:16,875 --> 01:43:19,375
Our names should never get
into police records.

1516
01:43:19,583 --> 01:43:21,208
If you accept this deal.

1517
01:43:21,417 --> 01:43:23,958
Take it as the money is in your hands.

1518
01:43:27,458 --> 01:43:28,792
I accept the deal.

1519
01:43:31,167 --> 01:43:34,500
If you try to escape...
Go.

1520
01:43:34,708 --> 01:43:35,958
You won't get that chance.

1521
01:43:36,917 --> 01:43:38,583
Give me details about that man.

1522
01:43:38,792 --> 01:43:39,833
I'll come back with money.

1523
01:43:40,417 --> 01:43:43,667
If I do this job, just think over it.

1524
01:43:43,875 --> 01:43:46,667
It would be like doing it
for welfare of the people.

1525
01:43:46,875 --> 01:43:49,958
As you expect my life too would change.

1526
01:45:18,542 --> 01:45:19,625
Security alert!

1527
01:45:22,167 --> 01:45:24,667
Brother!
- What the hell are you doing there?

1528
01:45:24,875 --> 01:45:28,750
Someone is opening the windmill lock,
what the hell are you doing there?

1529
01:45:28,958 --> 01:45:30,833
Whoever it may be,
kill him immediately.

1530
01:48:46,042 --> 01:48:47,500
Your job is done.

1531
01:49:12,833 --> 01:49:14,542
Indeed you're a smart professional.

1532
01:49:14,875 --> 01:49:16,083
You did as you promised.

1533
01:49:19,125 --> 01:49:20,833
Boys, catch them.

1534
01:50:09,875 --> 01:50:13,708
Bloody girls! Where are you hiding?
Come out I say!

1535
01:50:50,833 --> 01:50:51,917
Bloody thief!

1536
01:50:52,125 --> 01:50:54,750
I would've killed you also
along with your son.

1537
01:50:54,958 --> 01:50:56,292
You escaped!

1538
01:50:56,500 --> 01:50:58,417
You're very smart!

1539
01:51:04,125 --> 01:51:07,250
Indeed what I told you
about that Minister is true.

1540
01:51:07,458 --> 01:51:08,375
But a change in plan.

1541
01:51:08,583 --> 01:51:10,875
The money is not going
into Govt. treasury.

1542
01:51:11,083 --> 01:51:12,958
To my personal treasury.

1543
01:51:13,208 --> 01:51:16,917
Spurious liquor, chain snatching,
bribes at signals,

1544
01:51:17,125 --> 01:51:20,292
you know about small time
officers taking small bribes.

1545
01:51:20,500 --> 01:51:27,125
You wouldn't have seen top officers with
deals running into several thousand crores.

1546
01:51:27,292 --> 01:51:30,583
One among them is me.

1547
01:51:30,833 --> 01:51:32,375
You're a golden goose.

1548
01:51:32,583 --> 01:51:37,833
I too wish to keep a brilliant robber
like you under my control.

1549
01:51:38,042 --> 01:51:40,833
But they say kill fire and
revenge completely.

1550
01:51:41,042 --> 01:51:43,958
So, no way!

1551
01:51:57,917 --> 01:52:00,375
Sir, I wanted to call you myself.

1552
01:52:00,583 --> 01:52:01,625
But you came here.

1553
01:52:01,833 --> 01:52:03,875
I've arrested the accused
and confiscated the cash.

1554
01:52:04,083 --> 01:52:06,000
Shut up, man!

1555
01:52:06,167 --> 01:52:09,000
Money stolen from train,
illegal money transfer and flower market.

1556
01:52:09,167 --> 01:52:11,917
We know entire cash is with you only.

1557
01:52:15,375 --> 01:52:18,000
Manickavasagam is not
a honest officer as you think.

1558
01:52:18,167 --> 01:52:19,000
What are you saying?

1559
01:52:19,167 --> 01:52:22,667
Every time he catches a criminal,
he confiscates his money.

1560
01:52:22,875 --> 01:52:25,708
Then, he'll kill him
in the name of encounter.

1561
01:52:26,875 --> 01:52:29,833
I knew about this from
Jamaluddin's case.

1562
01:52:30,042 --> 01:52:30,833
What about my money then?

1563
01:52:31,042 --> 01:52:32,667
Your money is also
with Manickavasagam.

1564
01:52:32,875 --> 01:52:34,875
He shot dead Malik
and confiscated the cash.

1565
01:52:35,083 --> 01:52:36,667
He didn't surrender cash to dept.

1566
01:52:37,167 --> 01:52:39,250
He cheated his assistant Kumaravel,

1567
01:52:39,458 --> 01:52:42,875
he hid the fact of
confiscating cash from Malik.

1568
01:52:43,083 --> 01:52:44,417
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

1569
01:52:44,625 --> 01:52:47,792
If I tell you'll rob him too.

1570
01:52:48,625 --> 01:52:51,417
I don't want to see you
as a robber again.

1571
01:52:51,792 --> 01:52:55,833
His plan is to use you
to rob Minister's money.

1572
01:52:57,208 --> 01:52:59,833
Manickavasagam thinks
I'm also a criminal like him.

1573
01:53:00,583 --> 01:53:03,667
I'm a patient but not a fool.

1574
01:53:03,958 --> 01:53:05,250
Just watch, what I would do with him!

1575
01:53:10,333 --> 01:53:13,125
Do you want my life or Rs.500 crores?

1576
01:53:13,292 --> 01:53:14,125
Let's make a deal.

1577
01:53:14,292 --> 01:53:16,875
If you come to the place I suggest,
you'll get Rs.500 crores.

1578
01:53:17,083 --> 01:53:19,375
Take it and leave us.

1579
01:53:19,583 --> 01:53:21,917
What you get isn't just Rs.500 crores!

1580
01:53:22,125 --> 01:53:26,167
You'll get Manickavasagam alone,
the man who killed your son.

1581
01:53:26,375 --> 01:53:27,625
Think and decide.

1582
01:53:32,917 --> 01:53:37,417
Sir, Commissioner is here after watching
live killing Jamaluddin for money.

1583
01:53:45,792 --> 01:53:49,917
Sir Mysore printed currency
that we lost in train is also here.

1584
01:53:51,125 --> 01:53:54,167
I'll get entire cash from the
place Manickavasagam told me.

1585
01:53:54,375 --> 01:53:57,167
Keep RBI cash also along with it.

1586
01:53:57,375 --> 01:54:00,458
Using that as evidence,
only then we can frame charges on him.

1587
01:54:00,667 --> 01:54:01,833
We'll take care of it.

1588
01:54:02,333 --> 01:54:03,625
No doubt, sir.

1589
01:54:03,833 --> 01:54:06,583
This is same currency printed
in Mysore division.

1590
01:54:06,792 --> 01:54:09,458
How much I trusted you!

1591
01:54:09,667 --> 01:54:12,125
You're so cheap!

1592
01:54:12,333 --> 01:54:16,208
Police are struggling to get
fair name with general public.

1593
01:54:16,417 --> 01:54:21,708
If this news gets leaked, they'll say
we can't handle a pick-pocket case also.

1594
01:54:23,042 --> 01:54:26,458
Media knows about money seizure.

1595
01:54:26,667 --> 01:54:27,750
Do one thing.

1596
01:54:27,958 --> 01:54:31,625
Find a criminal already in our custody,
cover up his face,

1597
01:54:31,833 --> 01:54:33,875
present him as the accused
to the media.- Okay, sir.

1598
01:54:34,083 --> 01:54:36,833
News about Manickavasagam
must get leaked to media.

1599
01:54:37,042 --> 01:54:38,167
You got it?
- Yes, sir.

1600
01:54:38,375 --> 01:54:39,417
Now, arrest him.

1601
01:54:49,792 --> 01:54:52,833
Before or after RBI robbery,

1602
01:54:53,042 --> 01:54:54,833
many similar robberies had
taken place in Chennai.

1603
01:54:55,042 --> 01:54:59,083
Many individual teams were
formed to catch the gang,

1604
01:54:59,250 --> 01:55:00,500
they were working on
the case for months,

1605
01:55:00,708 --> 01:55:03,875
because of active policing,

1606
01:55:04,083 --> 01:55:07,167
we've found the entire
stolen money and the criminal.

1607
01:55:07,333 --> 01:55:09,417
Highlight of this case is,

1608
01:55:09,625 --> 01:55:14,042
two people who gave us
vital information about this case.

1609
01:55:14,208 --> 01:55:15,375
Sakthi and Diya!

1610
01:55:15,583 --> 01:55:20,833
I thank them for their help
on behalf of the police dept.

1611
01:55:21,042 --> 01:55:23,875
Kumar, you've done a great job.
- Thank you, sir.

1612
01:55:24,083 --> 01:55:25,500
Forget about job, sir.

1613
01:55:25,708 --> 01:55:27,833
What are we going to do
with confiscated cash, sir?

1614
01:55:28,042 --> 01:55:29,625
What's your suggestion?

1615
01:55:29,833 --> 01:55:34,292
If we deposit Rs.15 lakhs into bank
accounts of farmers in the state.

1616
01:55:34,500 --> 01:55:37,125
They'll repay their debts.
- Why Rs.15 lakhs?

1617
01:55:37,292 --> 01:55:39,583
That's a calculation, sir.
They know about it, sir.

1618
01:55:39,792 --> 01:55:41,417
Okay.
- Agriculture will prosper.

1619
01:55:45,292 --> 01:55:47,625
Sakthi, your struggle has
ended with success.

1620
01:55:47,833 --> 01:55:49,042
Start a new life.

1621
01:55:49,292 --> 01:55:50,958
Thanks.
- I miss you, buddy.

1622
01:55:51,833 --> 01:55:53,250
Hey, take care.
- Bye.

1623
01:55:53,458 --> 01:55:54,625
Yeah sure.

1624
01:56:04,917 --> 01:56:08,500
Hi...hello, you're listening
our FM 106.4, I'm your RJ...

1625
01:56:08,708 --> 01:56:12,000
I never expected I'll enter family life.

1626
01:56:12,167 --> 01:56:13,750
I still can't believe it.

1627
01:56:13,958 --> 01:56:18,167
As Jagan said, our life will be
a roller coaster ride.

1628
01:56:18,833 --> 01:56:19,458
Sure!

1629
01:56:19,667 --> 01:56:21,167
Industrialists who run away abroad
after cheating Indian banks,

1630
01:56:21,375 --> 01:56:23,000
must steal Rs.10 crores from them,

1631
01:56:23,167 --> 01:56:25,000
if I ask you to suggest an idea,

1632
01:56:25,167 --> 01:56:26,875
what will be your plan?

1633
01:56:27,083 --> 01:56:28,417
This is our next topic.

1634
01:56:28,625 --> 01:56:30,125
Make a plan and keep on planning.

1635
01:56:30,292 --> 01:56:33,292
I'll come back after a short break
to hear your plans in detail.

1636
01:56:33,500 --> 01:56:37,292
What you've to steal from them
is Rs.10 crores only!

1637
01:56:37,500 --> 01:56:39,583
This is 106.4 our FM!

1638
01:56:39,792 --> 01:56:41,167
Are you alright, Sakthi?

1639
01:56:41,375 --> 01:56:43,375
Yeah...yeah...fine.

1640
01:56:43,917 --> 01:56:44,917
Put on seat belt.

1641
01:56:49,708 --> 01:56:52,917
Demon...Demon...Demon...

1642
01:56:53,125 --> 01:56:56,167
He's on prowl and hunt
day in and day out...

1643
01:56:56,375 --> 01:56:59,250
He destroys everything
and everyone...

1644
01:57:22,625 --> 01:57:25,500
