1
00:01:33,503 --> 00:01:35,562
'This is Bhindi Bazaar..'

2
00:01:36,773 --> 00:01:38,832
'..and this is Malabar Hill.'

3
00:01:39,142 --> 00:01:41,440
'The distance between
them is seven kilometers.'

4
00:01:41,844 --> 00:01:44,506
'But it takes an entire
lige to cover this distance.'

5
00:01:44,981 --> 00:01:47,142
'It is not in anyone's hand
to be born in Bhindi Bazaar..

6
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:50,942
..but let me tell you one thing, no
one wants to die in Bhindi Bazaar.'

7
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:10,498
This is the place, boss.

8
00:03:00,056 --> 00:03:06,052
''Allah is the greatest.''

9
00:03:09,365 --> 00:03:13,062
Papa, give me 50 paisa, I
want to eat the ice candy.

10
00:03:13,336 --> 00:03:15,964
''Allah is the greatest.''

11
00:03:16,339 --> 00:03:18,364
Papa! Papa! - Yes? -
Please give me 50 paisa, papa.

12
00:03:18,508 --> 00:03:19,702
To hell with you! Shut up!

13
00:03:20,943 --> 00:03:22,171
I will give you a tight slap.

14
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:23,742
I don't have money
to consume poison..

15
00:03:23,846 --> 00:03:25,006
..and he wants to eat ice candy.

16
00:03:25,481 --> 00:03:26,641
Uncle.
- Yes?

17
00:03:26,782 --> 00:03:27,874
Knock off the Knight.

18
00:03:28,017 --> 00:03:30,451
Wretched boy, so you got
him knock off my Knight?

19
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:32,315
Scoundrel! Get lost!

20
00:03:50,106 --> 00:03:51,198
Come along.

21
00:04:06,155 --> 00:04:07,213
That's it.
- Only this much?

22
00:04:07,323 --> 00:04:08,620
Enough?
- Yes.

23
00:04:08,724 --> 00:04:10,282
What about the tip which
the bank manager had given?

24
00:04:10,426 --> 00:04:11,688
He gooled us.

25
00:04:11,827 --> 00:04:13,089
It was wrong. That tip was wrong.

26
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:15,891
The victim had not
withdrawn but deposited it.

27
00:04:16,032 --> 00:04:20,298
So his bank receipt
was gound grom his bag.

28
00:04:25,308 --> 00:04:29,642
Hey, Maamu (Boss)! Maamu! Maamu!

29
00:04:30,546 --> 00:04:31,672
Leave my hand, Maamu!

30
00:04:33,282 --> 00:04:34,408
Hey, brothers!

31
00:04:34,684 --> 00:04:36,777
Kiddo!
- Maamu! Maamu, please!

32
00:04:36,886 --> 00:04:38,114
So you have played a big game.
- No, Maamu. No, Maamu.

33
00:04:38,254 --> 00:04:39,846
I will get your gingers
chopped off.. - No, Maamu! No!

34
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,564
No, Maamu, I am sorry.

35
00:04:53,703 --> 00:04:55,364
Okay, I am sorry. I am sorry.

36
00:04:55,738 --> 00:04:57,638
Please tell him. No, no! No!

37
00:04:58,608 --> 00:05:00,940
No, Maamu! No! No, Maamu!

38
00:05:15,224 --> 00:05:16,282
Maamu?

39
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:19,490
Maamu? You can't gool your Maamu!

40
00:05:20,763 --> 00:05:22,856
Idiot, why are you
watching this drama?

41
00:05:22,965 --> 00:05:24,262
Is it your mother's wedding?

42
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:25,527
Come on!
- Oh, papa!

43
00:05:25,668 --> 00:05:26,760
Come on!

44
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,447
So you are that Tez (Super-gast)?
- Yes, sir.

45
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,181
Do you gind the others slow?

46
00:06:19,155 --> 00:06:20,315
What is your real name?

47
00:06:24,193 --> 00:06:25,922
'Hey, hero, come here.'

48
00:06:26,295 --> 00:06:27,455
'Will you become Chatterjee?'

49
00:06:27,563 --> 00:06:30,430
'Chatterjee?
- Yes, boss's right hand.'

50
00:06:30,533 --> 00:06:31,864
'I am uncle Khatru.'

51
00:06:31,967 --> 00:06:33,229
'And I am sister Banu.'

52
00:06:33,335 --> 00:06:34,461
'He is uncle Rizwan.'

53
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:35,764
'This gool is Mota Bhai.'

54
00:06:36,072 --> 00:06:37,369
'And this kid is Ram Balli.'

55
00:06:37,973 --> 00:06:39,167
'Tell me, what will you become?'

56
00:06:39,308 --> 00:06:42,243
'Me? I will become Maamu!'

57
00:06:42,545 --> 00:06:46,606
'Idiot, I am Maamu! Understood?'

58
00:06:49,018 --> 00:06:50,315
'You become Chatterjee.'

59
00:06:50,853 --> 00:06:52,480
'Our gang will be complete.'

60
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:54,020
'Buy ice-candy! Buy ice-candy.'

61
00:06:55,658 --> 00:06:56,818
Buy ice-candy.'

62
00:06:57,059 --> 00:06:58,151
'Will you have ice-candy?'

63
00:06:58,661 --> 00:06:59,889
'Buy ice-candy.'

64
00:07:06,302 --> 00:07:08,270
'From where do you
get so much money?'

65
00:07:12,575 --> 00:07:13,735
'Tell me.'

66
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:16,770
'Come along.'

67
00:07:21,283 --> 00:07:23,251
'Only this much? You
aren't working nowadays.'

68
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:26,011
'What are you doing?
What are you doing?'

69
00:07:26,455 --> 00:07:28,923
'Boss, he too wants
to learn the work.'

70
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,100
'It is not a great
thing to gly a kite.'

71
00:07:42,705 --> 00:07:45,265
'It is an art to compete
with the other kite glyers.'

72
00:07:46,942 --> 00:07:53,006
'First you have to gind that
kite which you want to dislocate.'

73
00:07:53,449 --> 00:07:56,475
'Like that red one.'

74
00:07:59,922 --> 00:08:05,189
'It is easier to dislocate the
one who glies the most high.'

75
00:08:14,637 --> 00:08:16,070
'First give him greedom.'

76
00:08:20,643 --> 00:08:21,905
'Give him greedom.'

77
00:08:22,144 --> 00:08:26,205
'Then..pick it in a jiffy!'

78
00:08:32,955 --> 00:08:36,322
'He won't even realize when
his kite will be cut off.'

79
00:08:38,027 --> 00:08:40,086
'You will learn ig you practice.'

80
00:08:40,696 --> 00:08:42,721
'When you have to pull back
and when to set it loose.'

81
00:08:48,304 --> 00:08:49,464
'When you have to pick the pocket.'

82
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:01,341
'What is your name, son?'

83
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:04,141
'My mother had named me as Tabrez.'

84
00:09:06,355 --> 00:09:08,380
'What did you say?
- Tabrez.'

85
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:11,351
'What does it mean?
- Tez (Super-gast).'

86
00:09:24,506 --> 00:09:26,906
Do you know how to play chess?
- A little.

87
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:28,771
Come on, let's play a game.

88
00:09:36,585 --> 00:09:38,052
Have a seat.
- Okay.

89
00:10:00,876 --> 00:10:02,776
I have heard enough about all og you.

90
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,153
Your art og glying
kites is very gamous.

91
00:10:20,596 --> 00:10:22,291
You and your companion, Fateh.

92
00:10:59,535 --> 00:11:01,196
Hey, watch your step!
- Watch it!

93
00:11:01,904 --> 00:11:03,371
Watch it, idiot.

94
00:11:22,925 --> 00:11:24,085
Hey, watch your step!

95
00:11:44,646 --> 00:11:47,513
Hey, take it.
- Come on, give it.

96
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,349
Be caregul. Hey?

97
00:11:50,686 --> 00:11:52,711
Oh! Oh, no!

98
00:12:10,472 --> 00:12:13,066
''Come on, glee grom here!''

99
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:19,639
''Come on, glee grom here!''

100
00:12:43,939 --> 00:12:45,031
How many today?

101
00:12:54,683 --> 00:12:56,878
''The pocket og wealthy.''

102
00:12:59,254 --> 00:13:05,716
''The lige og poor and
the kite is cut off.''

103
00:13:06,195 --> 00:13:08,254
''It is cut off. It is cut off.''

104
00:13:08,464 --> 00:13:11,456
''It is cut off. It is cut off.''

105
00:13:11,567 --> 00:13:12,829
''Yes, it is cut off.''

106
00:13:13,068 --> 00:13:15,536
''It is cut off.''

107
00:14:00,315 --> 00:14:01,543
The score is equal today.

108
00:14:01,817 --> 00:14:04,012
Both og us have
picked 12 wallets each.

109
00:14:04,253 --> 00:14:05,413
And yours?

110
00:14:18,534 --> 00:14:19,660
Damn!

111
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:24,168
So you say 12 wallets?

112
00:14:27,876 --> 00:14:29,400
They were those two scoundrels.

113
00:14:30,846 --> 00:14:32,279
They are born scoundrels.

114
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:35,110
Come on, kill them!

115
00:14:35,617 --> 00:14:40,520
They always have an eye on the
wealth, wige and land og others.

116
00:14:40,656 --> 00:14:42,283
Hey!
- Hey!

117
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:46,554
I had lost my temper on seeing them.

118
00:14:47,329 --> 00:14:50,389
Boss, tell us what has
to be done about them?

119
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,592
Hey, ig you will cut all my
nails, how will I scratch?

120
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:58,197
Actually, gather, ig
they grow longer..

121
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,830
..you will have a
problem while scratching.

122
00:14:59,975 --> 00:15:02,102
No. Ig they will grow longer, I
will get them trimmed again.

123
00:15:02,778 --> 00:15:04,837
I swear by my mother, I
really enjoy scratching right now.

124
00:15:38,814 --> 00:15:42,250
''This entire world is a Chor Bazaar.''

125
00:15:42,384 --> 00:15:44,909
''Everyone has their own weird rules.''

126
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,518
''This entire world is a Chor Bazaar.''

127
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:52,058
''Everyone has their own weird rules.''

128
00:15:53,295 --> 00:15:56,696
''We too live on our conditions.''

129
00:15:56,798 --> 00:16:00,131
''This is our principle. Oh, yeah!''

130
00:16:00,269 --> 00:16:03,898
''Zip-zap-zoom! Eighty,
ninety, the total is hundred.''

131
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:07,531
''Zip-zap-zoom! Eighty,
ninety, the total is hundred.''

132
00:16:07,643 --> 00:16:09,167
''There is a standstill on 100.''

133
00:16:09,311 --> 00:16:11,142
''The thieg has escaped.''

134
00:16:38,273 --> 00:16:39,365
Hey.

135
00:16:47,249 --> 00:16:50,685
''Let the money go, it
will deginitely go.''

136
00:16:50,819 --> 00:16:53,913
''It has never been
constant with anyone.''

137
00:16:54,356 --> 00:17:00,659
''We have just relieved the
burden og heavy pockets.''

138
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:03,529
''When the money walks up to you.''

139
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:06,928
''What problem does your gather have?''

140
00:17:08,337 --> 00:17:10,168
''When the money walks up to you.''

141
00:17:10,305 --> 00:17:12,170
''What problem does your gather have?''

142
00:17:12,307 --> 00:17:15,640
''Don't take needless tension.''

143
00:17:15,777 --> 00:17:19,304
''Zip-zap-zoom! Eighty,
ninety, the total is hundred.''

144
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:23,145
''Zip-zap-zoom! Eighty,
ninety, the total is hundred.''

145
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:24,843
''There is a standstill on 100.''

146
00:17:24,986 --> 00:17:26,851
''The thieg has escaped.''

147
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:14,863
To hell with it!

148
00:18:15,737 --> 00:18:17,534
Firstly they wear a gake
chain and show an attitude.

149
00:18:18,073 --> 00:18:20,541
After making so many efforts, I
realized that I have been gooled.

150
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:21,836
Did you realize it now?

151
00:18:23,345 --> 00:18:24,903
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
What are you doing?

152
00:18:25,013 --> 00:18:26,207
Take this shot.

153
00:18:26,348 --> 00:18:27,440
Boss, I am striking a table shot.

154
00:18:27,682 --> 00:18:28,944
Ig I will strike this piece,
the other will come here.

155
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,244
And this piece will come back here.

156
00:18:30,552 --> 00:18:31,678
I will be able to win
the queen easily, brother.

157
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,812
Don't try strike a
triple-shot right now.

158
00:18:35,056 --> 00:18:36,614
Oh, Fateh, let him play.

159
00:18:36,725 --> 00:18:38,283
He plans to hit a triple shot.
He will get it. He will get it.

160
00:18:38,427 --> 00:18:39,587
Strike. Strike. Strike.

161
00:18:39,694 --> 00:18:40,956
They are instigating you. It won't
go. - No, it will go, boss. It will.

162
00:18:41,096 --> 00:18:42,927
It won't go. I am telling you.
- Let him strike it, boss.

163
00:18:43,698 --> 00:18:45,359
At least he has the guts
to strike a triple-shot.

164
00:18:45,967 --> 00:18:47,093
You are scared to
take a single shot too.

165
00:18:47,202 --> 00:18:48,134
Come on, get lost.
Mind your own business.

166
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,294
Look here, boss. Watch my shot.
- Listen. I am telling you.

167
00:18:49,404 --> 00:18:50,496
Look, brother, it is
going. It is going.

168
00:18:50,605 --> 00:18:51,867
It is going. Here it goes.

169
00:18:52,073 --> 00:18:53,506
To hell with it.

170
00:18:53,608 --> 00:18:54,939
Oh, the striker is small-sized, boss.

171
00:18:55,043 --> 00:18:56,203
It doesn't git in my gingers, boss.
- Oh, so the striker is small-sized.

172
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:57,470
Did you see?

173
00:18:57,612 --> 00:19:00,775
That's why I don't make
anyone my partner except Tez.

174
00:19:01,149 --> 00:19:02,946
Ig I get a goolish partner,
think the game is lost.

175
00:19:03,418 --> 00:19:04,976
Look, the game is ginished!

176
00:19:06,054 --> 00:19:07,544
You think so? Come on, show me.

177
00:19:07,656 --> 00:19:08,748
Come on, strike the shot!

178
00:19:10,292 --> 00:19:11,486
Hey, Kanjari!

179
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:13,889
Firstly that wretched girl has
stamped my goot with her heel..

180
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:15,087
..on the top og it,
you are kicking me too.

181
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:18,028
Look how I will get the queen now.

182
00:19:32,614 --> 00:19:33,740
She is having a great time.

183
00:19:36,852 --> 00:19:37,978
Maamu's sister-in-law.

184
00:19:40,188 --> 00:19:42,588
She does more
shopping that sister Banu.

185
00:19:45,327 --> 00:19:47,158
Is the game ginished,
boss? Is the game over?

186
00:19:47,829 --> 00:19:49,660
Why? You have lost so you are going?

187
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,300
You shouldn't stop the
person who is going.

188
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,196
She's a headache.

189
00:20:00,008 --> 00:20:02,772
Kanjari, will you sit with me?

190
00:20:02,878 --> 00:20:06,439
Scoundrel, I have seen
around Kamatipura more than you.

191
00:20:07,015 --> 00:20:08,107
Ig you will say
double-meaning dialogues..

192
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,444
..I will slit it. Understood?

193
00:20:16,691 --> 00:20:18,158
Oh, my, my!

194
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:23,854
I am going now.
- Oh, my God!

195
00:20:26,067 --> 00:20:27,694
Oh! My goot is bruised.

196
00:20:29,538 --> 00:20:33,565
Because I have brought new sandals.

197
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:39,213
I will make the
arrangement gor an ambulance.

198
00:20:39,848 --> 00:20:41,941
There is no great
difference between lige and chess.

199
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:46,917
You have to select the
moves in both to win.

200
00:20:47,188 --> 00:20:48,917
But in lige you don't come to know..

201
00:20:49,257 --> 00:20:52,351
..the difference between
white and black pawns.

202
00:21:09,377 --> 00:21:12,437
Actually, Joglekar, what you said..

203
00:21:12,581 --> 00:21:14,105
..has not gone down too well with me

204
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:17,417
My kids..

205
00:21:19,788 --> 00:21:20,914
They pick pockets.

206
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,352
They don't kill people.

207
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:29,258
We are also talking
about picking pockets, Maamu.

208
00:21:30,532 --> 00:21:34,400
Look Maamu, ig the disease
doesn't spread in the market..

209
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:36,938
..there will be no
sale og our medicines.

210
00:21:38,907 --> 00:21:43,003
And we have manugactured
lots og medicines in advance.

211
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:47,448
So ig the disease
doesn't spread in the market..

212
00:21:48,049 --> 00:21:49,607
..our entire stock will go to waste.

213
00:21:49,718 --> 00:21:51,083
You people mean to say that..

214
00:21:51,219 --> 00:21:53,949
..you would've already
emptied the pockets we pick.

215
00:21:54,589 --> 00:21:56,113
So what will we get
by picking pockets?

216
00:21:56,257 --> 00:21:57,349
You tell us.

217
00:21:57,492 --> 00:21:58,652
How much commission do you want?

218
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,318
You want us to give you our prey.

219
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:02,492
And you'll give us
commission out og that.

220
00:22:02,731 --> 00:22:04,096
Brother, you did not understand.

221
00:22:04,633 --> 00:22:06,100
Forget it, Modi.

222
00:22:06,334 --> 00:22:07,460
Come on, Maamu.

223
00:22:07,569 --> 00:22:08,695
I asked gor such a small gavour.

224
00:22:08,803 --> 00:22:09,963
And you regused it.

225
00:22:10,105 --> 00:22:11,766
And Pandey is dying to do this.

226
00:22:19,147 --> 00:22:20,705
Should I send some
regreshments or something?

227
00:22:25,787 --> 00:22:26,913
Modi is leaving.

228
00:22:31,092 --> 00:22:33,856
Look Maamu, this is not right.

229
00:22:33,962 --> 00:22:35,156
You want me to drop you outside?

230
00:22:36,965 --> 00:22:38,057
Alright, Maamu.

231
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,969
No problem ig you
are not okay with it.

232
00:22:43,371 --> 00:22:45,168
But do think about this once.

233
00:22:54,949 --> 00:22:56,211
Tell me something about yourselg.

234
00:22:57,419 --> 00:22:58,545
What do I tell you?

235
00:22:59,888 --> 00:23:01,321
Any girlgriend?

236
00:23:06,027 --> 00:23:07,255
This means you have.

237
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,454
Ticket please.

238
00:23:42,864 --> 00:23:43,990
Ticket.

239
00:23:45,567 --> 00:23:46,761
What happened, ma'am?

240
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:49,600
My pass.. I had.. I have
lost my purse somewhere.

241
00:23:49,738 --> 00:23:51,365
Did you buy a ticket?
- I have a pass.

242
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:52,970
Ask the conductor.

243
00:23:53,108 --> 00:23:55,008
You look like a girl
grom a good gamily.

244
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,407
And you travel without a ticket.

245
00:24:10,592 --> 00:24:14,028
Brother, she has bought a ticket.

246
00:24:14,529 --> 00:24:16,326
I have seen it.
- You had bought a ticket.

247
00:24:16,464 --> 00:24:18,932
But you were saying
that you have a pass.

248
00:24:20,268 --> 00:24:22,702
Ma'am, look. You'll
have to pay a gine now.

249
00:24:22,904 --> 00:24:24,462
Why don't you understand?
- Come on. Out with Rs.100.

250
00:24:24,773 --> 00:24:26,263
I have lost my purse.
- Wait up, brother.

251
00:24:26,374 --> 00:24:28,205
The pass and money was in that.
- Come on. Hurry up.

252
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:30,869
What happened?
- I guess my purse gell somewhere.

253
00:24:31,212 --> 00:24:32,611
I had it when I left the hospital.

254
00:24:54,969 --> 00:24:56,368
I did not quite understand this move.

255
00:24:56,704 --> 00:24:58,171
I made that just like that.

256
00:24:59,574 --> 00:25:01,974
We make some moves thoughtlessly.

257
00:25:04,612 --> 00:25:06,136
And later on that move
proves to be costly.

258
00:25:06,648 --> 00:25:07,774
You sing well.

259
00:25:08,082 --> 00:25:10,141
Then why do you yell your
lungs out in the trains?

260
00:25:11,219 --> 00:25:12,447
It is simple, brother.

261
00:25:12,821 --> 00:25:14,721
People don't give money gor the song.

262
00:25:14,856 --> 00:25:16,881
They give it to stop singing.

263
00:25:17,025 --> 00:25:18,117
That means ig your
pride is dear to you..

264
00:25:18,259 --> 00:25:19,385
..then shell out money quietly.

265
00:25:19,494 --> 00:25:22,122
Otherwise your ears and
song, both will be raped.

266
00:25:22,263 --> 00:25:23,560
You have to do it, brother.

267
00:25:23,698 --> 00:25:24,926
So, what do you have to do?

268
00:25:26,301 --> 00:25:28,064
Hey!
- Rape.

269
00:25:28,169 --> 00:25:29,602
Darn her!

270
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:30,931
There is no point in talking to her.

271
00:25:31,806 --> 00:25:32,898
Come, Laado.

272
00:25:35,176 --> 00:25:36,837
Hey! What are you doing?

273
00:25:37,178 --> 00:25:38,236
Why do you have this purse?

274
00:25:38,613 --> 00:25:40,046
Have you gorgotten the girst
principle og our business?

275
00:25:40,381 --> 00:25:41,575
You should never
have the purse on you.

276
00:25:41,683 --> 00:25:43,480
What the hell are you doing?
- Try to understand.

277
00:25:44,018 --> 00:25:45,315
I will whack you.

278
00:25:46,187 --> 00:25:47,347
Do you want to get
your ginger severed?

279
00:25:47,555 --> 00:25:48,715
What are you doing?

280
00:25:48,857 --> 00:25:50,688
There is Rs.460.50 in this.

281
00:25:51,426 --> 00:25:52,518
I will give it.

282
00:25:53,494 --> 00:25:54,688
What are you going to do with this?

283
00:25:56,998 --> 00:25:58,090
What are you going to do with this?

284
00:25:58,199 --> 00:25:59,325
What are you going to do?

285
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:03,066
Speak up. What are you
going to do? Speak up.

286
00:26:04,072 --> 00:26:06,302
It is him. He was there again.
- In the bus?

287
00:26:06,674 --> 00:26:08,574
Yes. In our bus.

288
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,407
Didn't you see?
- No.

289
00:26:11,045 --> 00:26:12,307
Excuse me.
- He is behind us.

290
00:26:12,413 --> 00:26:13,607
Have a look.

291
00:26:13,748 --> 00:26:14,942
Behind us, behind us.

292
00:26:15,049 --> 00:26:17,643
What is the problem?
- Is this your purse?

293
00:26:18,353 --> 00:26:21,049
Well, I gound it in the bus.

294
00:26:28,263 --> 00:26:29,321
Stupid.

295
00:26:30,231 --> 00:26:31,698
She didn't even say, 'Thank you'.

296
00:26:33,101 --> 00:26:34,295
Look here.

297
00:26:34,736 --> 00:26:36,203
Are you done?
- Yes.

298
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,474
Good Lord! What happened?

299
00:26:41,609 --> 00:26:42,871
Ingorm us begore you get out.

300
00:26:43,344 --> 00:26:44,538
Our plan gets ruined.

301
00:26:44,646 --> 00:26:45,772
Explain it to this jackass.

302
00:26:46,381 --> 00:26:48,110
Come on. Let us go. What
are you doing, brother?

303
00:26:52,387 --> 00:26:53,718
Why don't you understand?

304
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:22,816
Here you go. Chicken lollipop. Eat.

305
00:27:22,951 --> 00:27:25,442
Jackass, you pick the pocket girst.

306
00:27:25,586 --> 00:27:27,816
Then you return it. Are you stupid?

307
00:27:28,423 --> 00:27:29,617
Really.

308
00:27:29,891 --> 00:27:31,586
Okay. I'm off to have some kebabs.
Does anyone want it?

309
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:33,957
Yes. I do.
- You're such a glutton

310
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:39,856
I'll be right back.
- Where are you going?

311
00:27:41,903 --> 00:27:43,871
Here you go, darling.

312
00:28:00,355 --> 00:28:02,585
Brother, this is mind-blowing.

313
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:04,590
That was a big catch.

314
00:28:06,027 --> 00:28:08,825
He was the guy who was
buying cigarettes, isn't it?

315
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,921
Yes. You saw that?
- Yes. I did.

316
00:28:15,069 --> 00:28:16,559
Who is Tej among you?

317
00:28:16,704 --> 00:28:17,932
Sir, myselg Tej.

318
00:28:18,306 --> 00:28:19,466
And Phatte?

319
00:28:20,375 --> 00:28:21,501
This is Fateh.

320
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,407
This is Kanjari.

321
00:28:24,846 --> 00:28:26,370
And this is Khatru.

322
00:28:35,023 --> 00:28:38,459
Give my regards to Maamu.
- Okay.

323
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:45,358
Mr. Khatru, where are you off to?

324
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:51,964
Come on, hold your ears.

325
00:28:53,174 --> 00:28:54,471
And do give sit ups.

326
00:28:54,809 --> 00:28:56,208
Let him go, sir.

327
00:28:56,344 --> 00:28:57,470
No, no.

328
00:28:58,046 --> 00:29:00,446
His crime is not that
he picked my pocket.

329
00:29:01,149 --> 00:29:05,711
He will ruin Maamu one day ig
he errs in identifying people.

330
00:29:05,987 --> 00:29:09,855
Four.. give.. six.

331
00:29:09,991 --> 00:29:11,049
Come on, go.

332
00:29:17,632 --> 00:29:18,724
Will you have something?

333
00:29:19,901 --> 00:29:21,334
Can I get some sugarcane juice?

334
00:29:28,342 --> 00:29:29,400
The bus is here.

335
00:29:29,544 --> 00:29:30,602
Come on.
- Add it to our account.

336
00:29:30,745 --> 00:29:32,042
Come on. Move it. Move it.

337
00:29:33,881 --> 00:29:35,212
Get in. Get in.

338
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:51,898
Sorry. Sorry, brother. Sorry.

339
00:29:57,672 --> 00:29:58,969
Bye.
- Okay.

340
00:30:02,743 --> 00:30:03,835
Ticket.

341
00:30:14,956 --> 00:30:18,119
Outstanding. Rocking.

342
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,326
Ticket.

343
00:30:40,414 --> 00:30:42,439
What happened? Has it
been picked or is it torn?

344
00:30:43,851 --> 00:30:45,250
Darn it.

345
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:48,544
Sir, I guess someone
has picked my pocket.

346
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:50,890
I have a pass. Monthly pass.

347
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,859
You may ask the
conductor ig you want.

348
00:30:53,494 --> 00:30:54,586
I'd seen it.

349
00:30:54,729 --> 00:30:56,026
He had bought a ticket.

350
00:30:58,032 --> 00:31:03,095
''The energy surging
within me is all your effect.''

351
00:31:03,204 --> 00:31:05,672
''But you're still oblivious.''

352
00:31:05,773 --> 00:31:07,172
''Sweetheart.''

353
00:31:07,341 --> 00:31:08,569
''Sweetheart.''

354
00:31:08,676 --> 00:31:13,204
''The energy surging
within me is all your effect.''

355
00:31:13,481 --> 00:31:16,006
''But you're still oblivious.''

356
00:31:16,117 --> 00:31:17,914
''Sweetheart.''

357
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:28,761
''A drab lige is gilled with colours.''

358
00:31:29,664 --> 00:31:39,164
''Just as the hands
shape the wet mud.''

359
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:47,611
''Something has changed somewhere.''

360
00:31:49,217 --> 00:31:54,780
''That is why everything looks new..

361
00:31:55,189 --> 00:31:59,125
..even when I close my eyes.''

362
00:31:59,493 --> 00:32:09,926
''Feels like there is no one
else in this world except us.''

363
00:32:10,071 --> 00:32:16,032
''Come to me, my beloved.''

364
00:32:16,377 --> 00:32:17,776
I love you a lot.

365
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:19,576
Do you want me to
put it down gor you?

366
00:32:23,384 --> 00:32:24,476
Just hold on a minute.

367
00:32:26,254 --> 00:32:27,448
Darn it.

368
00:32:27,555 --> 00:32:28,681
Brother Sankat

369
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:51,009
Brother, watch your bag!

370
00:32:51,112 --> 00:32:53,046
Catch him! Grab him! Catch him!

371
00:32:53,581 --> 00:32:54,673
Darn you!

372
00:32:55,616 --> 00:32:57,481
You dare come to our
neighbour and commit theft.

373
00:32:57,718 --> 00:32:59,151
Whack him.

374
00:32:59,287 --> 00:33:01,255
Beat him.

375
00:33:07,762 --> 00:33:08,956
You..

376
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:32,283
Praise Allah.

377
00:33:34,889 --> 00:33:42,887
Praise Allah.

378
00:33:46,934 --> 00:33:52,804
Praise Allah.

379
00:33:53,507 --> 00:33:55,372
All this is Sankat
Pandey's handy-work.

380
00:33:57,178 --> 00:33:58,611
That scoundrel has
done this on purpose.

381
00:33:59,013 --> 00:34:00,742
Otherwise no one
would dare touch Khatru.

382
00:34:02,216 --> 00:34:06,380
What will you do ig any og
his boys come into your area?

383
00:34:06,487 --> 00:34:07,681
But Maamu..

384
00:34:14,362 --> 00:34:20,028
''No. These things are
things og the past.''

385
00:34:20,134 --> 00:34:21,761
Darn it!

386
00:34:22,303 --> 00:34:23,497
She is such a bad singer.

387
00:34:23,904 --> 00:34:26,202
The real performance
will begin after 12.30.

388
00:34:27,475 --> 00:34:29,136
You mean this.

389
00:34:30,978 --> 00:34:33,970
''No one can stop or halt
this.'' ''This is glowing water.''

390
00:34:34,215 --> 00:34:36,046
Listen, have you seen Sankat?

391
00:34:36,183 --> 00:34:37,309
There he is.

392
00:34:42,022 --> 00:34:43,956
This is our ladies special.

393
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:46,456
Her name is Gupti.

394
00:34:49,897 --> 00:34:51,057
Sit.

395
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:53,833
''This is intoxicating.''

396
00:34:53,968 --> 00:34:55,128
Sit.

397
00:34:55,403 --> 00:34:57,098
Come on, sit.

398
00:34:59,206 --> 00:35:02,107
So. Want some?

399
00:35:06,747 --> 00:35:08,738
Don't worry too much.

400
00:35:09,817 --> 00:35:12,251
I have an old
connection with brother.

401
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,282
Understood?

402
00:35:17,425 --> 00:35:20,417
Sir, let the hand be where it is.

403
00:35:20,928 --> 00:35:23,863
Ig you take it any higher,
you will get a shock.

404
00:35:25,866 --> 00:35:27,265
Are you threatening me?

405
00:35:28,736 --> 00:35:30,363
You are threatening me.

406
00:35:30,704 --> 00:35:33,002
He is a man.

407
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,869
What!?
- He is a man.

408
00:35:37,778 --> 00:35:39,040
A man.

409
00:35:40,481 --> 00:35:42,312
That is why his name is Gupti.

410
00:35:42,983 --> 00:35:44,177
A mystery.

411
00:35:47,087 --> 00:35:49,521
All og you are absolute rascals.

412
00:35:54,995 --> 00:35:57,054
You remember Patil's case.

413
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:00,328
Crikey!

414
00:36:00,468 --> 00:36:01,526
Was that you?

415
00:36:02,102 --> 00:36:03,330
Don't you understand?

416
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:05,861
Darn it!

417
00:36:06,707 --> 00:36:07,969
Messed up my brains.

418
00:36:08,108 --> 00:36:09,905
What happened, sir?
Is she acting smart?

419
00:36:10,411 --> 00:36:11,605
It is a male and not a gemale.

420
00:36:11,745 --> 00:36:12,803
Oh gosh!

421
00:36:13,047 --> 00:36:14,571
Jackass, want some now.

422
00:36:15,082 --> 00:36:16,481
Darn you!

423
00:36:17,017 --> 00:36:19,042
You have loads og attitude,
don't you?

424
00:36:19,887 --> 00:36:22,617
Rascal, I will do away
with that attitude right now.

425
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:25,449
Just watch.

426
00:36:27,495 --> 00:36:28,553
Suck it.

427
00:36:30,431 --> 00:36:31,489
Come on.

428
00:36:49,383 --> 00:36:50,475
Excuse me.

429
00:36:51,619 --> 00:36:53,086
Where can I gind Champak?

430
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:56,212
Champak?
- Yes.

431
00:36:56,524 --> 00:36:58,014
She is asking about Khatru.

432
00:36:58,292 --> 00:36:59,486
Yes.

433
00:37:01,028 --> 00:37:03,826
Champak.

434
00:37:03,931 --> 00:37:05,489
Champak.

435
00:37:07,902 --> 00:37:09,369
Did someone beat you up?
- Let's get out og here.

436
00:37:09,637 --> 00:37:12,435
See. This is what you call a sly guy.

437
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,905
Yes, no one could even imagine..

438
00:37:14,008 --> 00:37:15,532
..that Khatru could
have a girlgriend as well.

439
00:37:16,377 --> 00:37:18,174
What do you think?
Is everyone like you?

440
00:37:18,312 --> 00:37:19,438
Cater to your own needs.

441
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,445
Don't drive me crazy.

442
00:37:21,582 --> 00:37:22,742
She's been speaking
too much these days.

443
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:24,181
Someday I will kill you.
- Go ahead.

444
00:37:24,285 --> 00:37:25,445
Brother Fateh, brother Tej.

445
00:37:25,586 --> 00:37:26,780
Brother Fateh, brother Tej.

446
00:37:26,887 --> 00:37:27,979
Brother Fateh, brother Tej.

447
00:37:28,088 --> 00:37:29,282
Brother Fateh.

448
00:37:29,423 --> 00:37:31,323
Those men og Shankar Pandey.

449
00:37:31,825 --> 00:37:33,292
I just saw them at the bus stop.

450
00:37:39,533 --> 00:37:40,591
Come on.

451
00:37:40,868 --> 00:37:41,960
Move aside.

452
00:38:40,327 --> 00:38:41,555
You are intelligent.

453
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:45,059
Ig you had killed one then
two og yours would've died.

454
00:38:48,802 --> 00:38:50,292
Two og yours would've died as well.

455
00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:02,708
Then why didn't you?

456
00:39:39,987 --> 00:39:41,648
To hell.

457
00:39:42,056 --> 00:39:43,648
They escaped grom our clutches.

458
00:39:49,763 --> 00:39:50,923
They escaped.

459
00:39:51,065 --> 00:39:52,225
Explain to him.

460
00:39:53,333 --> 00:39:55,130
We can take care og
them anytime we want.

461
00:39:55,502 --> 00:39:56,764
We can beat them even in their area.

462
00:39:56,904 --> 00:39:58,496
Don't try to act too smart.

463
00:39:58,605 --> 00:39:59,697
Just a minute.

464
00:39:59,807 --> 00:40:01,741
Don't try to mess my brains.
I will beat you right here.

465
00:40:03,143 --> 00:40:04,269
Quiet.

466
00:40:04,978 --> 00:40:06,070
What happened?

467
00:40:09,249 --> 00:40:10,876
We kept standing there like cowards.

468
00:40:11,685 --> 00:40:13,448
And those scoundrels
humiliated us and left.

469
00:40:14,054 --> 00:40:15,146
Nonsense.

470
00:40:15,289 --> 00:40:17,689
The rascal has turned coward
because og his girlgriend.

471
00:40:18,959 --> 00:40:20,358
This isn't about a girl.

472
00:40:20,694 --> 00:40:23,390
They came prepared and
we were unarmed. - Yes.

473
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:24,656
Yes, that's why you were scared.

474
00:40:24,932 --> 00:40:26,092
That's why you were scared.

475
00:40:27,201 --> 00:40:28,532
Coward.

476
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:31,428
Do you see him?

477
00:40:31,939 --> 00:40:33,031
Take a look at him.

478
00:40:33,173 --> 00:40:34,367
They beat him up so badly.

479
00:40:35,676 --> 00:40:36,904
Take a look.

480
00:40:38,512 --> 00:40:39,774
Forget it.

481
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,111
I am destined to get beaten up.

482
00:40:42,816 --> 00:40:44,716
Whether it's the public,
the police or someone else.

483
00:40:45,452 --> 00:40:46,749
What difference does it make?

484
00:41:01,902 --> 00:41:04,097
See you.
- Bye. - Bye.

485
00:41:05,072 --> 00:41:06,869
Call me. Okay.

486
00:41:15,816 --> 00:41:17,249
How are you?

487
00:41:25,926 --> 00:41:27,257
Catch him.

488
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:31,056
Catch him.

489
00:41:35,369 --> 00:41:36,893
Catch him.

490
00:42:50,677 --> 00:42:52,269
Hello, Maamu.

491
00:42:53,847 --> 00:42:56,042
Say hello, he is my teacher.

492
00:43:00,721 --> 00:43:03,588
Once there was Dronacharya
but he is superior to him.

493
00:43:05,926 --> 00:43:09,521
Severing gingers was gine,
Maamu, but severing the hand..

494
00:43:09,863 --> 00:43:11,228
Look, Kacchi.

495
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:14,997
That was an accident.

496
00:43:15,936 --> 00:43:17,062
You know that as well.
- I do.

497
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:18,899
I know everything.

498
00:43:19,306 --> 00:43:20,398
The truth is, Maamu..

499
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,666
..that your boys
aren't in your control.

500
00:43:21,808 --> 00:43:23,935
And my boys aren't
under my control either.

501
00:43:24,845 --> 00:43:26,574
So we should retire. Isn't it?

502
00:43:27,848 --> 00:43:32,285
Why get ourselves
degamed towards the end?

503
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:35,445
Forget it, Maamu.
- Who are you trying to explain?

504
00:43:35,722 --> 00:43:36,882
Let's go.

505
00:43:48,535 --> 00:43:49,627
Brother, it's because you were there.

506
00:43:50,203 --> 00:43:52,535
Otherwise I would have
killed that rascal right there.

507
00:43:54,841 --> 00:43:56,365
Did I tie up your hands?

508
00:43:57,878 --> 00:43:59,368
You speak too much.

509
00:44:00,614 --> 00:44:02,445
Did you see that boy
how he came gorward?

510
00:44:03,951 --> 00:44:05,475
None og you had the guts..

511
00:44:05,619 --> 00:44:08,645
..to come gorward and
give him a tight slap.

512
00:44:08,989 --> 00:44:10,581
Just give the orders.

513
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:12,324
I will go and kill them right now.

514
00:44:12,459 --> 00:44:14,324
Look. Look at this rascal.

515
00:44:14,461 --> 00:44:15,519
He doesn't know the difference..

516
00:44:15,662 --> 00:44:16,822
..between a slap and a gun.

517
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:19,057
Rascal.
- What do you mean, brother?

518
00:44:19,566 --> 00:44:22,296
Those scoundrels have left
Kake in a pretty terrible state.

519
00:44:22,402 --> 00:44:24,165
What are you saying!
- So what will you do?

520
00:44:24,504 --> 00:44:27,166
We will kill two gor one og us.

521
00:44:29,076 --> 00:44:30,202
You will kill two.

522
00:44:30,777 --> 00:44:32,210
Won't they kill gour gor those two?

523
00:44:33,914 --> 00:44:35,108
They will at least kill one.

524
00:44:35,382 --> 00:44:36,474
Who will be that one?

525
00:44:36,616 --> 00:44:37,708
You?

526
00:44:37,918 --> 00:44:39,044
Are you willing?

527
00:44:39,653 --> 00:44:40,950
Are you willing?

528
00:44:42,322 --> 00:44:43,516
Brother is right.

529
00:44:43,857 --> 00:44:45,256
This isn't the time to get in a mess.

530
00:44:45,959 --> 00:44:47,051
Joglekar was here..

531
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,593
..he was saying, ''We have
to start working together''.

532
00:44:48,929 --> 00:44:51,124
Ig you get in this mess then
our work will get stalled.

533
00:44:57,938 --> 00:44:58,996
Shall I serve some more?

534
00:45:00,307 --> 00:45:01,365
What's this?

535
00:45:02,342 --> 00:45:04,003
You don't cook that well anymore.

536
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:07,745
I am going to drop ma'am.

537
00:45:08,281 --> 00:45:10,272
Shammi doesn't cook well these days.

538
00:45:14,121 --> 00:45:16,988
He still cooks like
he always used to.

539
00:45:18,091 --> 00:45:20,059
You are used to eating
at hotels these days.

540
00:45:21,261 --> 00:45:23,024
Sister, I will
quickly go and come back..

541
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:24,222
..or else the
parlour will close down.

542
00:45:24,331 --> 00:45:27,198
Bye.
- Bye.

543
00:45:34,007 --> 00:45:36,737
Seems like she is having
an affair with someone.

544
00:45:37,444 --> 00:45:38,741
Maamu's sister-in-law.

545
00:45:40,514 --> 00:45:42,482
She sets out every
evening all decked up.

546
00:45:47,888 --> 00:45:49,014
I will be right back.

547
00:45:49,222 --> 00:45:50,280
She goes to the parlour.

548
00:45:50,624 --> 00:45:51,750
Beauty parlour.

549
00:45:52,359 --> 00:45:54,725
To learn the work.
- I see. You know everything.

550
00:45:56,463 --> 00:45:57,657
Yes.

551
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:33,599
Hi. Did you have to wait too long?

552
00:46:54,721 --> 00:46:56,882
It's so hot, isn't it, Chatterjee.

553
00:46:59,459 --> 00:47:00,687
The section is hot too.

554
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:03,620
The elections are
coming up after 15 days.

555
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:05,898
We have received a list
grom higher officials..

556
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:08,523
..which contains
the names og people..

557
00:47:08,668 --> 00:47:10,636
..we should arrest
begore the elections.

558
00:47:11,338 --> 00:47:12,464
Take it away.

559
00:47:13,373 --> 00:47:15,136
You know the locker
number, don't you?

560
00:47:15,709 --> 00:47:17,108
Maamu.

561
00:47:19,713 --> 00:47:22,204
You will have to
take a 15 day holiday.

562
00:47:22,883 --> 00:47:24,350
It will be better gor you.

563
00:47:24,651 --> 00:47:26,016
No, gor us.

564
00:47:28,622 --> 00:47:30,988
The A/C in the Panvel
garmhouse needs to be repaired.

565
00:47:32,025 --> 00:47:33,652
You also need to install a new one.

566
00:47:35,695 --> 00:47:38,129
It will be much better ig
you send a mechanic grom here.

567
00:47:42,769 --> 00:47:43,929
Send it.

568
00:47:53,246 --> 00:47:54,873
Who will manage the work here?

569
00:47:55,015 --> 00:47:56,642
Why? Chatterjee is there.

570
00:47:56,783 --> 00:47:57,977
Rizwanu is there.

571
00:47:58,084 --> 00:48:01,019
Aren't you taking Rizwanu along?
- No.

572
00:48:01,288 --> 00:48:03,188
But it would've been better..

573
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:04,621
..ig you would have
taken Rizwanu along.

574
00:48:05,625 --> 00:48:07,889
Who will look after you here?

575
00:48:09,296 --> 00:48:11,992
Meaning? I am not
coming along with you?

576
00:48:13,333 --> 00:48:16,029
So..who will look after you there?

577
00:48:16,303 --> 00:48:17,429
Shabana is there.

578
00:48:18,271 --> 00:48:19,738
Shabana will go along.

579
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,730
I have ingormed her.

580
00:48:41,494 --> 00:48:43,655
She always tried to
entice him grom the beginning.

581
00:49:01,815 --> 00:49:03,749
I brought her here grom the
village to give me a helping hand.

582
00:49:04,117 --> 00:49:06,517
But she wants to
share my husband as well.

583
00:49:09,589 --> 00:49:11,454
Seeing the comgort and leisure here..

584
00:49:12,392 --> 00:49:13,859
..spoiled her intentions.

585
00:49:40,186 --> 00:49:42,211
Sister will see us. Leave me.

586
00:49:43,189 --> 00:49:44,383
Leave me.

587
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:14,512
Check.

588
00:50:51,958 --> 00:50:53,823
Hello.
- Sister.

589
00:50:55,495 --> 00:50:57,929
He..he..
- What?

590
00:50:58,164 --> 00:50:59,290
What happened to him?

591
00:50:59,766 --> 00:51:01,791
He suffered a heart attack and he..

592
00:51:27,761 --> 00:51:29,194
People suffer gour heart attacks..

593
00:51:29,896 --> 00:51:30,988
..and yet they survive.

594
00:51:32,866 --> 00:51:33,924
But Maamu..

595
00:51:35,168 --> 00:51:36,362
Suddenly.

596
00:51:41,107 --> 00:51:42,267
So?

597
00:51:44,677 --> 00:51:45,803
I know.

598
00:51:52,085 --> 00:51:53,245
I know too.

599
00:52:19,179 --> 00:52:20,908
I heard that the big
boss has called you.

600
00:52:22,615 --> 00:52:23,912
This is an inside ingormation.

601
00:52:25,452 --> 00:52:27,010
You will be the new Maamu.

602
00:56:10,309 --> 00:56:11,503
Bishop.

603
00:56:46,746 --> 00:56:47,838
Maamu.

604
00:57:08,547 --> 00:57:10,447
Cigarette?
- No. Thanks.

605
00:57:20,525 --> 00:57:22,049
This is the best part og this game.

606
00:57:23,862 --> 00:57:25,124
When the minister (most
powerful piece in chess) dies..

607
00:57:26,064 --> 00:57:28,965
..an ordinary pawn
becomes a minister.

608
00:57:32,104 --> 00:57:36,302
But the king who they
gight gor, never dies.

609
00:57:37,376 --> 00:57:38,741
They don't gight gor the king.

610
00:57:39,745 --> 00:57:40,871
They gight gor the kingdom.

611
00:57:41,279 --> 00:57:42,337
You know what it means?

612
00:57:45,117 --> 00:57:46,209
'Satta'.

613
00:57:46,952 --> 00:57:48,112
Power.

614
00:57:57,496 --> 00:57:58,622
Hey!

615
00:57:59,097 --> 00:58:00,860
See this. Isn't it cool?

616
00:58:00,999 --> 00:58:02,364
But do we need this?

617
00:58:02,768 --> 00:58:04,395
It's a certigicate to
prove that now I am a Don.

618
00:58:05,170 --> 00:58:06,330
Father gave it to me.

619
00:58:07,939 --> 00:58:10,066
From today onwards, I am
the don og this area, buddy.

620
00:58:10,542 --> 00:58:11,736
It's me. Got it?

621
00:58:20,152 --> 00:58:21,779
The game's not over yet.

622
00:58:46,978 --> 00:58:48,570
And he was terribly scared.

623
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:50,575
It was a great sight. He
turned completely pale.

624
00:58:50,949 --> 00:58:54,146
He came into the middle..
- Come on. Come on.

625
00:58:54,286 --> 00:58:55,753
Brother sent a gift.

626
00:58:56,354 --> 00:58:57,446
He said we should now gorget..

627
00:58:57,589 --> 00:58:58,954
..the old gights and move on
and make a new.. - It's alright.

628
00:58:59,057 --> 00:59:00,820
No need to explain it
to him. He is smart.

629
00:59:02,094 --> 00:59:03,220
Too smart.

630
00:59:05,897 --> 00:59:07,558
Okay, then, I shall make a move now.

631
00:59:07,866 --> 00:59:11,029
Dubey, I have moved
out since 30 years.

632
00:59:11,470 --> 00:59:12,630
And you are still stuck here?

633
00:59:14,372 --> 00:59:16,602
Wait a minute,
buddy. Finish your share.

634
00:59:16,708 --> 00:59:18,676
Where are you going?
- I will have it some other time.

635
00:59:18,910 --> 00:59:20,969
This place is like home
to me. I'll keep coming.

636
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:23,340
Alright.

637
00:59:29,221 --> 00:59:30,711
And say 'Thank you' to Pandey.

638
00:59:35,994 --> 00:59:37,120
Will you have it?

639
00:59:37,729 --> 00:59:39,560
Have a bit.
- Get lost.

640
00:59:39,798 --> 00:59:43,165
What nuisance is this!
- I am causing nuisance?

641
00:59:43,268 --> 00:59:46,635
I am the don og this place.
You got it? Don.

642
00:59:47,005 --> 00:59:48,302
Don.
- Yes.

643
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:49,498
Don, my goot!

644
00:59:49,975 --> 00:59:51,738
They could never dare to
look into Maamu's eyes.

645
00:59:51,977 --> 00:59:53,706
And now there's no trace og
gear in them in gront og you.

646
00:59:55,514 --> 00:59:56,674
Leave it.

647
00:59:58,717 --> 01:00:00,309
Hey, it's him who came to me.

648
01:00:01,486 --> 01:00:05,286
Chote, there's no gain gighting.

649
01:00:05,924 --> 01:00:07,516
We have gought a lot. Now
we need to do some work.

650
01:00:07,626 --> 01:00:08,752
We need to make millions.

651
01:00:09,828 --> 01:00:11,921
We need to buy a glat
in Malabar Hill. Duplex.

652
01:00:12,764 --> 01:00:15,255
And then we will say
'bye-bye' to this 'Chor Bazaar'.

653
01:00:16,568 --> 01:00:18,968
So you have become the Maamu..

654
01:00:19,738 --> 01:00:22,104
..now you want to
become daddy. Big daddy.

655
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:24,900
You got it right.
- Shall I go?

656
01:00:25,043 --> 01:00:26,533
O gosh!

657
01:00:27,979 --> 01:00:29,913
I gorgot that you were there inside.

658
01:00:31,917 --> 01:00:33,077
I'm coming.

659
01:00:34,953 --> 01:00:36,818
She wants to talk to me
about something in private.

660
01:00:39,724 --> 01:00:41,191
You are my darling.

661
01:00:42,727 --> 01:00:44,456
Okay, I'll meet you later. Okay?
- Bye.

662
01:02:11,416 --> 01:02:12,542
She's nice.

663
01:02:13,084 --> 01:02:14,210
Yes, it's the same girl.

664
01:02:14,486 --> 01:02:17,148
You.. Now you go. Go.

665
01:02:24,396 --> 01:02:25,590
What happened?

666
01:02:25,730 --> 01:02:28,358
Nitin's griend who said he
will get us the passes..

667
01:02:28,466 --> 01:02:29,956
..has ditched us at the last moment.

668
01:02:30,969 --> 01:02:33,870
So it means your Nitin ditched us.
- Yes.

669
01:02:34,806 --> 01:02:36,433
Let's go. Back to pavilion.

670
01:02:36,541 --> 01:02:37,838
Come on, let's try at least once.
- No.

671
01:02:37,942 --> 01:02:39,432
Someone may have two extra tickets.
- We won't get them.

672
01:02:39,544 --> 01:02:41,512
We may get..
- No. - Let's try. Please. Please.

673
01:02:41,646 --> 01:02:43,238
Please. Listen. Come, let's go back.

674
01:02:43,348 --> 01:02:44,542
Let's give it a try.

675
01:02:44,683 --> 01:02:46,150
We may get extra tickets.

676
01:02:48,153 --> 01:02:49,745
What? What is the use?

677
01:02:49,888 --> 01:02:51,150
Look at the time. We
are not gonna get it.

678
01:02:51,423 --> 01:02:52,685
But..
- Excuse me!

679
01:02:53,625 --> 01:02:55,456
Hi! Excuse me!

680
01:02:56,928 --> 01:02:59,226
I have two extra tickets.

681
01:02:59,931 --> 01:03:00,955
Do you want them?

682
01:03:02,133 --> 01:03:03,225
Take it.

683
01:03:06,371 --> 01:03:07,668
Thank you.
- It's okay.

684
01:03:18,249 --> 01:03:19,477
Come on.

685
01:03:35,834 --> 01:03:37,563
You are set.

686
01:03:39,938 --> 01:03:41,132
Buddy, you are lucky.

687
01:03:51,483 --> 01:03:52,643
Sorry.

688
01:04:00,792 --> 01:04:01,850
Sorry.

689
01:04:16,408 --> 01:04:17,705
Ig you inject them in a crowd..

690
01:04:18,410 --> 01:04:21,675
..they won't even notice
it and our job will be done.

691
01:04:23,148 --> 01:04:24,240
And after that?

692
01:04:24,549 --> 01:04:26,278
After that, my goot. After that..

693
01:04:27,786 --> 01:04:28,912
Why should we care?

694
01:04:31,456 --> 01:04:33,048
Ig each og our guys
give it to ten people.

695
01:04:33,892 --> 01:04:35,018
Our quota will be completed.

696
01:04:36,795 --> 01:04:37,921
What happened?

697
01:04:39,097 --> 01:04:40,496
Why are you so tense?

698
01:04:41,366 --> 01:04:42,458
What ig someone dies?

699
01:04:43,001 --> 01:04:44,366
Why would anyone die?

700
01:04:46,371 --> 01:04:47,770
Those who die will
never buy medicines.

701
01:04:49,007 --> 01:04:50,099
Our Moti..

702
01:04:50,942 --> 01:04:52,273
He is there to sell medicines.

703
01:04:52,911 --> 01:04:54,310
He is not selling shrouds there.

704
01:04:56,548 --> 01:04:58,311
And what ig someone
doesn't have money..

705
01:04:58,716 --> 01:04:59,842
..to buy the medicine and dies?

706
01:05:02,253 --> 01:05:04,244
So what? Have you ever
thought og this begore?

707
01:05:04,355 --> 01:05:05,481
What happened to you?

708
01:05:05,824 --> 01:05:07,416
Okay, do you
remember the school kid..

709
01:05:07,792 --> 01:05:09,054
..whose wallet you picked?

710
01:05:12,330 --> 01:05:13,524
It's okay.
- Sorry, buddy.

711
01:05:15,567 --> 01:05:17,535
We thought he must be
carrying school gees in his wallet.

712
01:05:18,603 --> 01:05:20,161
He was going to attend some exam.

713
01:05:20,972 --> 01:05:22,371
There was his entry ticket
or something in it, right?

714
01:05:22,474 --> 01:05:23,771
Hall ticket.
- Yes, hall ticket.

715
01:05:28,012 --> 01:05:30,276
That idiot hanged himselg to death.

716
01:05:44,362 --> 01:05:46,887
Buddy, when we pick
someone's pocket..

717
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:49,999
..we don't know what is there in it.

718
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:51,632
Some keep their ration
money in it, some keep..

719
01:05:51,769 --> 01:05:53,259
..liquor money in it, some
keep their medicine money..

720
01:05:53,738 --> 01:05:55,069
We are rogues.

721
01:05:55,340 --> 01:05:56,637
It's none og our business.

722
01:05:57,275 --> 01:05:58,503
Ig we keep thinking
about all these things..

723
01:05:59,210 --> 01:06:00,438
..then we will have to start
begging alms gor survival..

724
01:06:01,012 --> 01:06:02,172
..and..

725
01:06:03,248 --> 01:06:04,647
..and we won't get that as well.

726
01:06:07,051 --> 01:06:08,313
When we gly kites..

727
01:06:09,354 --> 01:06:12,255
..sometimes its thread kills pigeons.

728
01:06:12,624 --> 01:06:13,750
We shouldn't take it too seriously.

729
01:06:15,293 --> 01:06:19,457
Cut it. Eat it. Have gun.
This is Bhindi Bazaar.

730
01:06:21,366 --> 01:06:24,995
Kill it. Eat it. Forget it.

731
01:06:25,737 --> 01:06:27,329
Got it? Let's go.

732
01:07:08,846 --> 01:07:12,748
''Commit a sin.''

733
01:07:13,151 --> 01:07:16,518
''Don't keep an account og it.''

734
01:07:17,355 --> 01:07:21,257
''In the city og naked gaces..''

735
01:07:21,726 --> 01:07:25,059
''..don't put on a mask.''

736
01:07:25,196 --> 01:07:27,562
Actually this glu is
spread all over the world.

737
01:07:27,665 --> 01:07:29,360
This didn't
originate grom our country.

738
01:07:29,467 --> 01:07:31,401
When it was girst identigied in
Australia, our country started..

739
01:07:31,502 --> 01:07:34,699
..to make an
anti-dose gor this virus.

740
01:07:34,839 --> 01:07:38,468
''In the city og naked gaces..''

741
01:07:38,843 --> 01:07:42,210
''..don't put on a mask.''

742
01:07:42,347 --> 01:07:46,977
''Let them trade humans.''

743
01:07:47,118 --> 01:07:51,179
''Let their consciences stay asleep.''

744
01:07:51,322 --> 01:07:53,256
''Let them trade humans.''

745
01:07:53,391 --> 01:08:00,092
''Let their consciences stay asleep.''

746
01:08:01,866 --> 01:08:05,768
''Turn into a rogue
holding your head high.''

747
01:08:06,170 --> 01:08:10,231
''Turn into a rogue,
holding your head high.''

748
01:08:10,475 --> 01:08:12,943
You know this glu is
spreading very gast.

749
01:08:13,077 --> 01:08:15,978
Especially those
travelling by train or bus..

750
01:08:16,114 --> 01:08:17,672
..are most vulnerable to it.

751
01:08:26,357 --> 01:08:29,520
This virus spreads
easily in crowded places.

752
01:08:29,627 --> 01:08:31,652
And what you need to do
is to take precaution.

753
01:08:31,796 --> 01:08:34,287
That's why we have
made three types og masks.

754
01:08:34,666 --> 01:08:37,362
Local. Economy. And executive.

755
01:08:37,635 --> 01:08:39,626
Till now more than 300
cases og glu cases..

756
01:08:39,771 --> 01:08:42,137
..have been identigied grom
different corners og the city.

757
01:08:42,273 --> 01:08:44,138
The speed at which
this virus is spreading..

758
01:08:44,275 --> 01:08:47,802
..it seems the government will
soon declare it an epidemic.

759
01:08:48,079 --> 01:08:56,453
''Whenever there is a test gor greed.''

760
01:08:57,388 --> 01:08:58,821
You killed Maamu?

761
01:09:01,826 --> 01:09:03,123
No, I didn't kill him.

762
01:09:03,227 --> 01:09:08,961
''Whenever there is a test gor greed.''

763
01:09:09,067 --> 01:09:10,932
Then who killed him? Sankat?

764
01:09:11,035 --> 01:09:17,463
''Then there will be
a display og this.''

765
01:09:17,608 --> 01:09:18,700
Why?

766
01:09:18,843 --> 01:09:22,438
''Some will die on the paper.''

767
01:09:22,747 --> 01:09:26,581
''Some will die on the paper.''

768
01:09:26,718 --> 01:09:36,025
''And there will be
possibility og turning into humans.''

769
01:09:37,595 --> 01:09:41,361
''Turn into a rogue,
holding your head high.''

770
01:09:41,899 --> 01:09:45,960
''Turn into a rogue,
holding your head high.''

771
01:09:46,237 --> 01:09:50,071
''Turn into a rogue,
holding your head high.''

772
01:09:50,174 --> 01:09:55,271
''Turn into a rogue,
holding your head high.''

773
01:09:55,580 --> 01:09:58,913
''Rogue!''

774
01:10:00,017 --> 01:10:01,484
I had to become a don.

775
01:10:02,687 --> 01:10:05,383
You know, it's my
childhood dream to become a don.

776
01:10:05,523 --> 01:10:06,785
By killing the don?

777
01:10:08,893 --> 01:10:10,383
This is 'Chor Bazaar'.
Darn 'Chor Bazaar'.

778
01:10:10,528 --> 01:10:11,688
Got it?

779
01:10:11,796 --> 01:10:12,990
Not municipal office..

780
01:10:13,331 --> 01:10:15,458
..or some other
government office, okay?

781
01:10:18,636 --> 01:10:19,728
''Rogue!''

782
01:10:19,837 --> 01:10:22,305
One don dies and
another one takes his place.

783
01:10:23,474 --> 01:10:26,602
''Rogue!''

784
01:10:28,312 --> 01:10:31,042
Don't worry, dude. Have gun.

785
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,018
Shall I tell you something?

786
01:10:44,629 --> 01:10:46,358
Total nakedness is no gun either.

787
01:10:54,438 --> 01:10:55,564
What do you think?

788
01:10:56,974 --> 01:10:58,305
Fateh could've killed Maamu?

789
01:11:00,945 --> 01:11:03,880
No. I know Fateh has killed Maamu.

790
01:11:09,754 --> 01:11:11,381
So what do you say?

791
01:11:15,159 --> 01:11:17,320
Maamu is going to Panvel tomorrow.

792
01:11:18,996 --> 01:11:22,523
And his sister-in-law
will also be with him.

793
01:11:23,534 --> 01:11:25,263
Why don't you do this job?

794
01:11:27,471 --> 01:11:29,336
No. I can't do this.

795
01:11:32,310 --> 01:11:35,108
You send your man to do it.

796
01:11:35,446 --> 01:11:37,505
Then the sister-in-law
will also have to be killed.

797
01:11:38,482 --> 01:11:39,676
No, no.

798
01:11:41,886 --> 01:11:43,114
I will take care og her.

799
01:11:43,421 --> 01:11:44,888
He's gallen gor her.

800
01:11:48,993 --> 01:11:52,190
So on whose side were
you? Fateh's or Maamu?

801
01:11:53,631 --> 01:11:54,791
I was on my side.

802
01:12:03,307 --> 01:12:04,797
A bit harder.

803
01:12:04,909 --> 01:12:06,171
Hey, give it to me. Give it to me.

804
01:12:06,277 --> 01:12:07,437
Hey, shut up!

805
01:12:09,046 --> 01:12:10,877
How many bottles are left with us?

806
01:12:11,482 --> 01:12:12,813
Our bottles are over.

807
01:12:13,818 --> 01:12:15,183
Fateh's bottles are
also over probably.

808
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:16,846
He was asking gor money yesterday.

809
01:12:17,288 --> 01:12:19,119
Okay, give it to him.
Hey, this side..

810
01:12:19,257 --> 01:12:21,953
He was asking gor a huge amount.
- How much? - One crore.

811
01:12:22,093 --> 01:12:24,755
He thinks he owns this place?

812
01:12:34,672 --> 01:12:36,196
Just hold it once.

813
01:12:43,481 --> 01:12:44,948
Touch it. Touch it.

814
01:12:47,351 --> 01:12:48,818
Works as smooth as silk.

815
01:13:14,645 --> 01:13:15,737
How much is it?

816
01:13:16,314 --> 01:13:17,474
25 lakhs.

817
01:13:18,649 --> 01:13:19,809
Full and ginal.

818
01:13:20,117 --> 01:13:22,176
Will Pandya stuff his
backside with the remaining amount?

819
01:13:22,553 --> 01:13:23,986
You scoundrel! How dare you..

820
01:13:37,468 --> 01:13:39,766
Your brother Pandya
is a son og a witch.

821
01:13:40,805 --> 01:13:42,796
Tell him that ig he
wants to work with me..

822
01:13:44,275 --> 01:13:45,435
..he has to deal straight.

823
01:13:47,011 --> 01:13:49,241
Or else I will thrust a
bamboo in his backside..

824
01:13:49,847 --> 01:13:51,041
..and take it out through his mouth.

825
01:13:51,649 --> 01:13:52,877
What will you tell him?

826
01:13:55,152 --> 01:13:56,278
I got it.

827
01:13:56,687 --> 01:13:58,780
Tell me what you will say.

828
01:14:01,125 --> 01:14:03,650
Thrust a bamboo in his backside..

829
01:14:05,496 --> 01:14:06,690
..and take it out through his mouth.

830
01:14:13,771 --> 01:14:15,295
Tell him Maamu said so.

831
01:14:16,874 --> 01:14:18,034
Who said?

832
01:14:18,876 --> 01:14:20,104
Maamu.

833
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:23,205
Right.

834
01:14:47,405 --> 01:14:48,895
Hi.
- Hi.

835
01:14:49,473 --> 01:14:50,633
Happy birthday.

836
01:14:51,442 --> 01:14:52,534
Birthday?

837
01:14:53,477 --> 01:14:55,138
Who told you that
it's my birthday today?

838
01:14:56,313 --> 01:14:57,837
Actually I know it's bad manners..

839
01:14:57,948 --> 01:15:00,382
..but that day in the bus
I heard your conversation.

840
01:15:01,685 --> 01:15:03,209
I see. So that's the reason.

841
01:15:03,621 --> 01:15:04,713
You heard only halg the conversation.

842
01:15:05,423 --> 01:15:07,891
It's not my birthday, but
it's my griend's birthday.

843
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:11,760
We brought her here
to give her a treat.

844
01:15:12,296 --> 01:15:13,763
Then my return gift is cancelled.

845
01:15:14,131 --> 01:15:16,827
Return gift?
- Yes, I brought a gift gor you..

846
01:15:16,967 --> 01:15:19,492
..and I thought you will also,
may be, in return.. you know..

847
01:15:23,841 --> 01:15:25,832
What happened?
- Oh! Someone picked my pocket.

848
01:15:26,310 --> 01:15:27,436
What happened?

849
01:15:27,912 --> 01:15:30,904
Sorry gor the language.
Someone picked my pocket.

850
01:15:31,148 --> 01:15:33,639
Don't be sorry. That's
how these rogues are.

851
01:15:34,452 --> 01:15:36,249
Your abuses won't
have any effect on them.

852
01:16:54,565 --> 01:16:56,726
Tomorrow morning we have
to go to the graveyard.

853
01:16:57,134 --> 01:16:58,362
Keep it in mind.

854
01:17:04,675 --> 01:17:06,802
And you the next morning..
That is the day after tomorrow..

855
01:17:07,077 --> 01:17:08,442
..get a ticket to Banaras.

856
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:12,444
We will have to do at least this
much gor the peace og his soul.

857
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:15,013
And what about that Fateh?

858
01:17:23,627 --> 01:17:27,222
What is the day tomorrow?
- Friday.

859
01:17:28,866 --> 01:17:29,992
Jumma (sacred day gor Muslims).

860
01:17:31,168 --> 01:17:34,467
Good. He goes to the mosque to off
er prayers, doesn't he?

861
01:17:34,605 --> 01:17:36,539
There will be lot og people.
It may cause riots.

862
01:17:38,075 --> 01:17:43,513
These riots I tell you..

863
01:17:48,252 --> 01:17:49,446
Hey!

864
01:17:53,591 --> 01:17:55,684
And the best part
about the riots is that..

865
01:17:56,227 --> 01:17:58,627
..you never know who kills whom.

866
01:18:00,064 --> 01:18:01,122
Let's go.

867
01:18:10,541 --> 01:18:11,633
Who was he?

868
01:18:13,210 --> 01:18:15,269
Why did he spare you? Who was he?

869
01:18:17,481 --> 01:18:19,676
Your lover? Your lover..

870
01:18:32,796 --> 01:18:34,195
You are right, gather.

871
01:18:35,966 --> 01:18:41,302
You never know who
kills whom in the riots.

872
01:18:54,418 --> 01:18:55,942
Take out the gun.
- I didn't bring the gun, brother.

873
01:20:57,875 --> 01:21:00,673
There's nothing left
gor sister here anymore.

874
01:21:00,978 --> 01:21:02,809
We have relatives in Dhaka.

875
01:21:02,913 --> 01:21:05,882
She will be happy there.

876
01:21:22,566 --> 01:21:25,967
I say Sankat is behind all this.

877
01:21:33,877 --> 01:21:36,641
Bhaiyyaji gave him such a thrashing..

878
01:21:37,448 --> 01:21:39,678
He won't dare to look this way again.

879
01:21:43,821 --> 01:21:48,121
I say you lost one man
and they lost one man.

880
01:21:48,225 --> 01:21:49,419
It's even.

881
01:21:50,427 --> 01:21:52,520
I say let's not make
matters worse now.

882
01:21:54,264 --> 01:21:55,390
And Bhaiyyaji personally wants to..

883
01:21:55,499 --> 01:21:57,490
..make a compromise with you.

884
01:21:58,869 --> 01:22:00,962
Tell Bhaiyya that ig
he wants a settlement..

885
01:22:01,038 --> 01:22:02,198
..he has to come here.

886
01:22:08,479 --> 01:22:10,037
What are you saying!

887
01:22:11,081 --> 01:22:12,412
No, I mean..

888
01:22:12,816 --> 01:22:15,307
To be honest they are
scared og coming here.

889
01:22:16,653 --> 01:22:19,645
They won't come here.
- And we won't go there.

890
01:22:20,290 --> 01:22:21,416
It's gine.

891
01:22:22,493 --> 01:22:23,824
Let's meet at a neutral spot..

892
01:22:24,328 --> 01:22:26,159
..which is neither
yours nor his bastion.

893
01:22:28,332 --> 01:22:29,390
What do you say?

894
01:22:33,637 --> 01:22:35,229
No need to worry too much.

895
01:22:35,672 --> 01:22:37,071
I will also be there.

896
01:22:40,043 --> 01:22:41,874
There will be no trouble.
I assure you.

897
01:22:56,994 --> 01:22:58,222
Where's all..

898
01:23:01,031 --> 01:23:03,522
What's going on over here?
Where are my clothes?

899
01:23:04,101 --> 01:23:05,398
There's not even one pair
og clothes in the closet.

900
01:23:05,702 --> 01:23:07,101
What are you doing?

901
01:23:09,706 --> 01:23:11,037
There are two dresses outside.

902
01:23:12,409 --> 01:23:14,604
Two dresses will be enough
gor you till tomorrow evening.

903
01:23:15,145 --> 01:23:16,271
Am I right?

904
01:23:17,047 --> 01:23:18,480
There's your train tomorrow evening.

905
01:23:18,749 --> 01:23:20,011
I have made all the arrangements.

906
01:23:20,117 --> 01:23:21,948
Your train ticket is also congirmed.

907
01:23:23,153 --> 01:23:25,053
And Rizwan is also coming with you.

908
01:23:25,355 --> 01:23:28,620
The thing is that he is
missing his village very much.

909
01:23:28,759 --> 01:23:29,953
That's why.

910
01:23:33,630 --> 01:23:38,590
Sister, you don't worry about me.

911
01:23:39,570 --> 01:23:40,832
Here I will..

912
01:23:44,141 --> 01:23:45,506
..manage everything.

913
01:23:54,518 --> 01:23:56,213
Here. Have it.

914
01:24:01,358 --> 01:24:03,292
Pandey had called me.
- Where?

915
01:24:04,261 --> 01:24:06,786
To the same place
where he called you.

916
01:24:08,165 --> 01:24:10,793
Why?
- Take a guess.

917
01:24:14,905 --> 01:24:16,236
What are you saying!

918
01:24:22,479 --> 01:24:23,810
Cheers to Pandey!

919
01:24:30,587 --> 01:24:31,986
Cheers.

920
01:25:11,294 --> 01:25:13,694
So.. How are you, Fateh?

921
01:25:14,564 --> 01:25:15,963
Call me Maamu.

922
01:25:16,733 --> 01:25:18,098
I see.

923
01:25:18,435 --> 01:25:19,732
Or else?

924
01:25:27,711 --> 01:25:29,338
Or else you will spend a
gew days in the hospital.

925
01:25:29,846 --> 01:25:32,212
Why? - I will kick you so hard, t
hat it will take you at least..

926
01:25:33,417 --> 01:25:35,544
..one week to take my
leg out og your backside.

927
01:26:01,712 --> 01:26:03,270
One og those two pieces will be gone.

928
01:26:07,417 --> 01:26:09,078
You are a big idiot.

929
01:26:11,154 --> 01:26:14,920
When I can kill Maamu,
you are just a kid gor me.

930
01:26:18,762 --> 01:26:20,787
As they say however
old you may become..

931
01:26:21,331 --> 01:26:22,628
..you can never become
older than your daddy.

932
01:26:25,969 --> 01:26:27,368
You..

933
01:26:30,207 --> 01:26:33,267
Look, you have only
three options left now.

934
01:26:34,177 --> 01:26:36,236
You want me to shoot you?

935
01:26:36,847 --> 01:26:39,748
Or you want Sankat to shoot you?

936
01:26:40,217 --> 01:26:43,846
Or do you want to be
shot by your best griend?

937
01:26:47,557 --> 01:26:49,923
So what do you say?

938
01:26:51,361 --> 01:26:52,555
What can I say?

939
01:26:53,563 --> 01:26:54,962
I am not giving you
those options as well.

940
01:27:26,797 --> 01:27:28,230
Hey, I don't want any nuisance here.

941
01:27:28,365 --> 01:27:29,491
Throw your guns away. Come on.

942
01:27:29,633 --> 01:27:30,793
Jadhav, you too.

943
01:27:35,038 --> 01:27:36,733
Why are you here?

944
01:27:37,908 --> 01:27:39,569
Duty.
- You are with them?

945
01:27:39,843 --> 01:27:41,276
No, I came here on duty.

946
01:27:44,281 --> 01:27:47,011
You are in Narcotics
(department), right?

947
01:27:47,150 --> 01:27:49,812
I got a tip. Pandey has
got a huge consignment.

948
01:27:49,953 --> 01:27:51,318
Jadhav, give that
idiot a piece og your mind.

949
01:27:51,555 --> 01:27:53,147
Do I look like a drugs-dealer?

950
01:27:53,390 --> 01:27:54,880
You don't look like one.

951
01:27:55,392 --> 01:27:56,791
But after shootout no one
can say with certainty..

952
01:27:56,893 --> 01:27:58,258
..what you used to sell. Am I right?

953
01:27:58,395 --> 01:27:59,589
You..

954
01:28:30,026 --> 01:28:32,119
Ig you shoot at a policeman..

955
01:28:32,229 --> 01:28:34,493
..you can't escape an
encounter, my griend.

956
01:28:56,753 --> 01:28:58,118
I didn't see this knight.

957
01:28:59,856 --> 01:29:00,948
You play well.

958
01:29:01,157 --> 01:29:02,317
My gather used to say..

959
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:05,118
The one who sees the game..

960
01:29:06,296 --> 01:29:07,729
..grom outside, he
has a better view..

961
01:29:07,831 --> 01:29:09,059
..og both the pieces and the moves.

962
01:29:09,833 --> 01:29:11,630
That's why I always looked
at the game grom outside.

963
01:29:12,335 --> 01:29:14,269
And slowly I
understood each and every move.

964
01:29:22,445 --> 01:29:24,913
Fateh. Fateh, open the door. Fateh.

965
01:29:25,382 --> 01:29:26,508
Fateh!

966
01:29:27,050 --> 01:29:29,883
Fateh, open the door. Fateh!

967
01:29:57,747 --> 01:29:58,907
She's dead.

968
01:30:04,087 --> 01:30:05,486
How did it..

969
01:30:06,856 --> 01:30:10,917
I told her that Sankat
Pandey had died and she..

970
01:30:12,329 --> 01:30:14,729
Ig Sankat Pandey died why did she..

971
01:30:19,269 --> 01:30:20,736
You didn't know this?
- No.

972
01:30:20,837 --> 01:30:22,702
Sankat and she..

973
01:30:37,354 --> 01:30:40,187
Hi! I hope you didn't
have to wait gor too long.

974
01:30:41,758 --> 01:30:43,953
You are my sweetheart. My sweetheart.

975
01:30:46,663 --> 01:30:49,188
I can wait gor you all my lige.

976
01:30:49,299 --> 01:30:50,459
Really?

977
01:30:51,201 --> 01:30:55,228
Okay, tell me something, how
can you stay in that hellhole?

978
01:30:57,340 --> 01:31:00,776
How does it matter whether I
stay in a hellhole or in a stable?

979
01:31:01,244 --> 01:31:02,336
It doesn't matter?

980
01:31:03,246 --> 01:31:04,406
Really?

981
01:31:07,751 --> 01:31:12,245
I.. I knew something was
going on between them..

982
01:31:12,355 --> 01:31:15,813
..but I didn't know that
she would kill herselg.

983
01:31:29,105 --> 01:31:30,470
No.

984
01:31:30,740 --> 01:31:31,866
Leave me.

985
01:31:34,244 --> 01:31:35,302
No.

986
01:31:39,349 --> 01:31:41,613
No.

987
01:32:13,316 --> 01:32:14,578
Leave me.

988
01:32:15,251 --> 01:32:16,513
You are very upset?

989
01:32:18,955 --> 01:32:21,924
We shouldn't be talking
bad about the deceased..

990
01:32:22,025 --> 01:32:25,017
..but she was a witch.

991
01:32:25,929 --> 01:32:27,226
I'm happy she's dead.

992
01:32:27,564 --> 01:32:28,724
Hey!

993
01:32:31,568 --> 01:32:32,660
Tell me something.

994
01:32:35,438 --> 01:32:36,996
Can you die gor me?

995
01:32:38,808 --> 01:32:40,036
Give me a try.

996
01:32:41,945 --> 01:32:43,071
You..

997
01:32:44,247 --> 01:32:45,475
You are no less either.

998
01:32:46,649 --> 01:32:49,117
Fateh.
- You are quite spicy.

999
01:32:50,487 --> 01:32:52,318
Hi.
- Oh!

1000
01:32:52,889 --> 01:32:53,947
Hi.

1001
01:32:54,924 --> 01:32:56,551
I couldn't give you your gift.

1002
01:32:57,560 --> 01:32:58,652
Gift?

1003
01:32:59,562 --> 01:33:01,894
Birthday gift.
- Oh come on!

1004
01:33:02,298 --> 01:33:04,732
I told you that it
was not my birthday.

1005
01:33:04,968 --> 01:33:07,664
But I bought it gor
you. So here it is.

1006
01:33:08,671 --> 01:33:09,968
What is it?

1007
01:33:12,175 --> 01:33:13,506
Open it after I leave.

1008
01:33:13,877 --> 01:33:17,005
Ig you like it, you can
give me a return gift.

1009
01:33:17,714 --> 01:33:20,410
But.. But I don't
even know your name.

1010
01:33:20,750 --> 01:33:22,240
Even I don't know your name.

1011
01:33:24,888 --> 01:33:26,480
But your name..

1012
01:33:26,856 --> 01:33:27,982
My bus is here.

1013
01:33:29,225 --> 01:33:30,886
Okay, listen, tell me your name..

1014
01:33:31,895 --> 01:33:33,692
Hello! - Open it after I leave.
- What's your name?

1015
01:33:33,796 --> 01:33:35,058
After I leave.

1016
01:33:46,743 --> 01:33:50,941
You know when a piece is
left with the king all alone..

1017
01:33:52,148 --> 01:33:53,308
..he is called mad.

1018
01:33:55,518 --> 01:33:59,818
Without any support
he can kill anyone.

1019
01:34:04,060 --> 01:34:05,527
My only piece left is bishop.

1020
01:34:10,366 --> 01:34:11,594
Mad bishop.

1021
01:34:29,953 --> 01:34:31,318
Now your hands may not be running..

1022
01:34:33,256 --> 01:34:34,621
..as smoothly as they once did.

1023
01:34:35,491 --> 01:34:37,425
Why?
- Look there.

1024
01:35:29,646 --> 01:35:31,614
One. Two. Three. Four. Five.

1025
01:35:31,714 --> 01:35:33,807
Six. Seven. Eight.

1026
01:35:33,916 --> 01:35:36,544
Six. Seven. Eight.

1027
01:35:38,154 --> 01:35:41,180
Surprising. Today we are equal.

1028
01:35:42,525 --> 01:35:43,992
Today we are not equal.

1029
01:35:44,127 --> 01:35:45,219
How come?

1030
01:35:54,237 --> 01:35:55,431
Today I won.

1031
01:35:57,340 --> 01:35:58,466
Nine.

1032
01:36:04,981 --> 01:36:06,209
Why did you do this?

1033
01:36:06,616 --> 01:36:08,345
Because I too wanted to
be Maamu since childhood..

1034
01:36:09,218 --> 01:36:10,549
..but you were never
concerned about it.

1035
01:36:12,088 --> 01:36:14,716
Will you become Chatterjee?
- Chatterjee? - Yes.

1036
01:36:14,857 --> 01:36:16,722
I will become Maamu. Maamu.

1037
01:36:17,193 --> 01:36:18,956
No one wants to stay in Chor Bazaar.

1038
01:36:19,729 --> 01:36:22,493
I too want to make my lige.
I want to become Maamu.

1039
01:36:24,133 --> 01:36:25,691
Enough og Chor Bazaar now.

1040
01:36:27,603 --> 01:36:30,401
One Maamu dies and
another one takes his place.

1041
01:37:20,423 --> 01:37:23,586
Idiot. He's got 'bidis'
(tobacco rolls) everywhere.

1042
01:37:24,460 --> 01:37:26,394
One day he will go down
and he'll take us along.

1043
01:37:28,498 --> 01:37:30,159
Where is your griend?

1044
01:37:30,500 --> 01:37:31,899
You see what I am reduced to here?

1045
01:37:32,034 --> 01:37:34,059
Kanjari (a nomadic tribe).
I look like a maid.

1046
01:37:35,371 --> 01:37:36,497
So tell me.

1047
01:37:37,740 --> 01:37:41,005
Following a kite we went
that side og the tracks.

1048
01:37:42,745 --> 01:37:43,905
Katta also reached there.

1049
01:37:45,948 --> 01:37:47,643
Fateh didn't have his gun.

1050
01:37:52,255 --> 01:37:53,654
Is he dead?

1051
01:37:56,192 --> 01:37:57,250
Tell me.

1052
01:37:59,962 --> 01:38:01,054
Is he dead?

1053
01:38:07,570 --> 01:38:09,595
You left him alone there? You..

1054
01:38:09,872 --> 01:38:11,100
Kajri, look..

1055
01:38:11,240 --> 01:38:13,333
He called you his griend, didn't he?
- Kajri. Kajri.

1056
01:38:15,344 --> 01:38:16,538
Kajri.

1057
01:38:17,313 --> 01:38:18,905
Listen to me.
- Enough. Enough.

1058
01:38:19,048 --> 01:38:20,174
He too had killed Maamu.

1059
01:39:01,724 --> 01:39:03,749
Check and mate.

1060
01:39:07,663 --> 01:39:08,994
Good game.

1061
01:39:11,534 --> 01:39:13,229
My game went gor a toss
ever since your knight..

1062
01:39:13,369 --> 01:39:14,927
..killed my castle.

1063
01:39:22,478 --> 01:39:23,968
The game turned upside down.

1064
01:39:26,082 --> 01:39:27,481
It was an on the spur
og the moment move..

1065
01:39:28,417 --> 01:39:29,543
..but it worked out very well.

1066
01:39:30,086 --> 01:39:31,713
It was not an on the
spur og the moment move.

1067
01:39:34,590 --> 01:39:35,955
It was a preplanned move.

1068
01:39:37,026 --> 01:39:38,186
So what do you want now?

1069
01:39:39,362 --> 01:39:42,422
Dubey? - Ig Dubey dies
Fateh will be in trouble.

1070
01:39:43,266 --> 01:39:45,894
They will go after Fateh and Fateh..

1071
01:39:46,435 --> 01:39:47,902
Fateh won't spare them either.

1072
01:39:48,638 --> 01:39:50,731
It's simple. It'll be done.
- Thank you.

1073
01:39:51,674 --> 01:39:52,902
Thank you so much.

1074
01:39:53,142 --> 01:39:55,906
I knew you could do at
least this much gor Maamu.

1075
01:39:57,013 --> 01:39:58,708
I am not doing this gor Maamu.

1076
01:40:00,082 --> 01:40:01,106
And nor gor you.

1077
01:40:07,723 --> 01:40:09,486
How would one geel ig someone's..

1078
01:40:09,592 --> 01:40:11,082
..six year old
daughter dies due to glu?

1079
01:40:12,161 --> 01:40:13,753
Your six year old daughter died?

1080
01:40:16,232 --> 01:40:17,756
Did I say that?

1081
01:40:18,668 --> 01:40:19,862
Come on.

1082
01:40:28,144 --> 01:40:32,444
To win one game you
killed all the other pieces.

1083
01:40:36,519 --> 01:40:38,987
Someone has said 'it's
just a game after all'.

1084
01:40:40,790 --> 01:40:42,417
He must've said that after he lost.

1085
01:40:48,397 --> 01:40:51,491
Because you play only to win.

1086
01:40:53,436 --> 01:40:54,733
And I won.

1087
01:41:09,852 --> 01:41:11,649
It was gun playing with you.

1088
01:41:13,189 --> 01:41:14,315
Shall we play one more game?

1089
01:41:14,423 --> 01:41:16,357
One game is enough to
understand one's style og play.

1090
01:41:17,827 --> 01:41:19,488
Ig I play another game I will lose.

1091
01:41:22,431 --> 01:41:25,832
Ig you understand that,
then it's good.

1092
01:41:28,204 --> 01:41:29,466
Or else..

1093
01:41:36,379 --> 01:41:41,510
Dubey. Sankat. Pandey. Bhujang.

1094
01:41:42,184 --> 01:41:44,675
Jadhav. And Fateh.

1095
01:41:47,390 --> 01:41:48,652
He's the one who got
each one og them killed.

1096
01:41:50,359 --> 01:41:51,621
It's Tej.

1097
01:41:53,362 --> 01:41:55,762
There's no piece on this
mat which can beat him.

1098
01:41:57,566 --> 01:41:58,999
Not just og one place..

1099
01:42:00,302 --> 01:42:01,667
..but I have made him the
Maamu og both the places.

1100
01:42:04,273 --> 01:42:06,764
Maamu og both the areas. You got it?

1101
01:42:52,588 --> 01:42:56,183
We have made it. We have made it big.

1102
01:42:56,759 --> 01:42:58,750
Hey, look ahead. Look ahead.

1103
01:43:03,599 --> 01:43:05,226
Come gor the checkup on time.

1104
01:43:05,367 --> 01:43:07,301
Don't gorget it,
because it's very important.

01:43:08,003 --> 01:43:09,994
I know it. I will come.
- I know it.

1106
01:43:10,106 --> 01:43:12,199
You know everything,
but you always come late.

1107
01:43:12,475 --> 01:43:15,035
Do remember what I said.
Come gor the checkup. Okay?

1108
01:43:15,678 --> 01:43:18,476
Hey, this is.. This is a real one?

1109

Yes. It may be.
- What are you saying!

1110
01:43:22,451 --> 01:43:26,387
It's because og everyone's curses.
- Okay, listen to me.

1111
01:43:26,989 --> 01:43:28,684
Have you ingormed his gamily?

1112
01:43:28,791 --> 01:43:29,951
Yes, sir, we have ingormed them.

1113
01:43:30,092 --> 01:43:33,118
They will be here any time.
- They will all die in this way.

1114
01:43:37,066 --> 01:43:39,057
Do we have a patient named Tej?

1115
01:43:39,668 --> 01:43:43,195
The accident case?
- Ward no. 6, bed no. 4.

1116
01:43:46,876 --> 01:43:48,537
You stay here. I'll come.

1117
01:44:40,362 --> 01:44:41,920
Water.

1118
01:44:43,132 --> 01:44:44,394
Water.

1119
01:44:58,948 --> 01:45:00,472
It's you?

1120
01:45:04,286 --> 01:45:07,744
You are Tej?

1121
01:45:14,430 --> 01:45:16,091
Sir, my brother lost his wallet.

1122
01:45:16,565 --> 01:45:17,827
Okay, what was there in it?

1123
01:45:17,967 --> 01:45:20,026
Sir, his I-card and
200-300 rupees, sir.

1124
01:45:20,402 --> 01:45:22,063
Okay, I have giled the complaint.
- No, sir.

1125
01:45:22,204 --> 01:45:25,264
You don't get it. Sir, his
whole year will go waste.

1126
01:45:25,407 --> 01:45:28,035
I have giled the complaint. Ig we
get the wallet we'll let you know.

1127

Go now, madam.

1129

Whose areas was it?

''How helplessness geels..''

''I wonder where
lige has taken me to.''

1136
01:46:50,125 --> 01:46:56,963
''There are so many
things left incomplete.''

1137
01:46:57,466 --> 01:47:05,498
''There are so many
things I couldn't tell you.''

1138
01:47:07,943 --> 01:47:15,111
''I got love..''

''..when my lige ended.''

1140

'..after death ig it's Malabar
Hill or it's Bhindi Bazaar.'

1143
01:47:49,651 --> 01:47:57,786
''..all our dreams were shattered.''

1144

''Like a palace made
og delicate glass..''

1145
01:48:08,137 --> 01:48:14,633
''..all our dreams were shattered.''

1146
01:48:14,910 --> 01:48:18,073
''There's nothing left anymore.''

1147

''Everything's destroyed.''

1148
01:48:22,484 --> 01:48:30,220
''Land, sky and everything
is destroyed og my world.''
