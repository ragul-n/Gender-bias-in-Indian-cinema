00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:19,540
[woman] One of the world's best writers
of all time Leo Tolstoy says

2
00:02:19,907 --> 00:02:23,810
All great stories were born
in one of these two situations.

3
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:27,915
Firstly, when a man travels

4
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:31,785
to an unknown or a new place,

5
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:32,953
secondly,

6
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:37,824
when a complete stranger
goes to a place

7
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:39,893
The place where I am now

8
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,862
is replete with stories.

9
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:48,068
The people who are on their last legs
of life come to this place.

10
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:50,637
And this is the last stop
in their life's journey

11
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:54,641
I think you know
the place I'm talking about.

12
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:00,981
[laughter]

13
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:05,118
The people you are looking at
belong to the first kind

14
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,221
[bell tolling]

15
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:11,191
These people need the blessings
of the God they believe in,

16
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:15,162
along with some warmth
and a little hospitality

17
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:16,697
and a few nice words.

18
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:21,435
It will help them forget
all their pain and smile

19
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:24,004
Maryamma.

20
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:25,839
Are you still unwell?

21
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:28,275
Come on, open your mouth.

22
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:30,143
-Now, the second kind...
-[loud knocking]

23
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:33,080
It's really a challenge
to look after them.

24
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:33,981
Open the door!

25
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:37,918
Despite being around people
they remain strangers to them

26
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:41,488
They always feel deserted

27
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:46,026
because their own family
abandoned them.

28
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:48,962
Uncle, please open the door.

29
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,566
Therefore, wherever they go,
they remain strangers

30
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:55,002
to everyone.

31
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,411
I don't want anyone's advice.

32
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:06,246
I won't listen to anyone!

33
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:11,151
My son had to move to the US.

34
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:13,520
I was a burden to him,
so he dumped me here.

35
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,390
He wants to see me now.

36
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,160
Never thought of me once
in these four years.

37
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:24,665
Everyone in here,
has a tragic story to tell.

38
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:29,369
I witness their ordeal
and suffering everyday.

39
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:32,306
And to serve them
without getting affected by all this...

40
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:36,109
It's the biggest challenge ever.

41
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:44,551
Somehow, their problems become my own
and I get disturbed a lot.

42
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:47,254
Eventually, you got a headache, Sarah?

43
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:48,522
Mother, can I ask you something?

44
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:52,960
Why is there so much bitterness
in relationships?

45
00:04:54,595 --> 00:04:56,697
Is it that difficult to forgive

46
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:57,965
for Varadharajan?

47
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:59,166
Which Varadharajan?

48
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:01,168
Our Varadharajan, Mother.

49
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:03,704
The one who says, "May I help you..."

50
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:08,208
Is that Varadharajan or Sundarajan?
Try to recall.

51
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:09,743
It's Sundarajan.

52
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:11,645
Yes.

53
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:14,781
Why did I say Varadharajan?

54
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:16,917
Where? All of a sudden?

55
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:18,385
It's not all of a sudden,

56
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:21,922
we have been planning
on giving you a break.

57
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,924
I don't need any break, Mother?

58
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,726
I'm quite happy here.

59
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:26,727
Sister?

60
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,829
Whose decision is it?
Yours or Mother's?

61
00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:31,598
Mother's, but...

62
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:35,202
Where am I going
with all these packed bags, Sister?

63
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:41,375
Who do you think you are?
Son of a bitch! Hang up!

64
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:50,584
Mother, where am I going?

65
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:54,688
We're going to have Davanagere benne dose
after Chitradurga and head towards Honna...

66
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:00,861
Mother, please tell me.

67
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:05,065
Sarah, life is a long journey.

68
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:09,503
Every journey has a story of its own.

69
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:15,042
And in this journey of yours,
a new story awaits you.

70
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:21,548
And to tell us all your story,
you have to go now.

71
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:24,651
You must go, dear.

72
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:28,789
-Hello. Hello, sir...-Have you left?

73
00:06:28,856 --> 00:06:30,624
Yes, I've picked her up.

74
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:31,825
-Ask for her name.
-Yes, sir.

75
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:33,594
What's your name, madam?

76
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:36,597
-Sarah Mary.
-Sarah...

77
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:38,198
Sarah-Maari!

78
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:40,267
Not Sarah-Maari, Sarah Mary.

79
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:41,368
That's her name.

80
00:06:41,435 --> 00:06:42,503
Give the phone to her.

81
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:46,640
Madam, here.
Go ahead, madam.

82
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,713
Welcome to Nadi Moola Resort, madam.

83
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:57,751
I say this to everyone who comes here.
You're destined to visit us.

84
00:06:57,851 --> 00:06:58,752
Travel safe.

85
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:00,888
Piping hot biriyani is awaiting you.

86
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:01,822
Oh, really?

87
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:03,991
I love biriyani.

88
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:29,983
Nadi Moola resort is the best resort
in this entire area, ma'am.

89
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:33,253
You will start feeling better
the moment you step inside.

90
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:35,122
Come, madam.

91
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:38,058
Ma'am, this is your room.

92
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:42,362
Damn it.
Ma'am, please hold this.

93
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:46,667
I don't know what's wrong?
The bulb? Or the wiring?

94
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,736
It's a great resort.
Just a tiny problem with the bulb.

95
00:07:50,404 --> 00:07:54,608
Ma'am, you freshen up.
I'll get you something to eat.

96
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:57,110
Okay.

97
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:03,784
Madam, come on in.
Special room service exclusively for you.

98
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:08,956
Piping hot biryani,
Nadi Moola resort's special.

99
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:32,212
Superb!

100
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,782
The chef is a great cook.

101
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:43,690
I would like to meet the chef
and thank him in person.

102
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:47,127
No problem.
You can see him right away.

103
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:49,229
In the meantime, I'll fix the bulb.

104
00:08:49,296 --> 00:08:51,298
Really? Where can I find him?

105
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:54,568
You will find a docked boat
with a curtain

106
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:58,939
that's where you will find the man
who cooked this delicious biryani.

107
00:08:59,006 --> 00:08:59,806
Hello?

108
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:01,875
Hello?

109
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:05,546
Did you cook the biriyani?

110
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:07,014
It was delicious.

111
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,953
Hello... Mister!
I'm talking to you.

112
00:09:21,195 --> 00:09:23,830
The taste is familiar.

113
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:29,503
In fact, it gives a sense of belonging
in an unknown place like this.

114
00:09:33,774 --> 00:09:34,975
Anyway, thanks.

115
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:39,213
Don't say thanks, ma'am.

116
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:41,982
It frightens me.

117
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:43,584
What?

118
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:46,153
Are you serious?

119
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,021
Does it really frighten you?

120
00:09:48,322 --> 00:09:49,122
Yes.

121
00:09:52,226 --> 00:09:56,330
Several years ago, a girl visited
this place and tasted my cooking.

122
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:57,497
And then she said "thanks."

123
00:09:57,998 --> 00:10:01,235
That moment changed my life forever.

124
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:03,003
Oh, I see.

125
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:03,971
But, how?

126
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:08,876
Can thanks mean so much to someone?

127
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,811
It's surprising.

128
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:12,980
How is it possible?

129
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:15,983
It's a long story, madam.

130
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:21,288
I'm going to tell a stranger's story
to another stranger.

131
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:23,490
This is very interesting.

132
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,325
Tell me the story, please?

133
00:10:25,726 --> 00:10:26,426
Madam...

134
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:29,229
Please! Please, please, please.

135
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,497
-Tell me.
-Okay, come.

136
00:10:30,898 --> 00:10:32,666
If you want to hear this story,

137
00:10:33,534 --> 00:10:35,102
then you'll have to watch this dream first.

138
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:38,005
My child.

139
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:43,777
Come here, dear.

140
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:44,845
Come.

141
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,817
Come here, dear.

142
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:56,890
Wake up, dear.
I've been waiting for you.

143
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:02,496
I'm cooking for you, sweetheart.

144
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:19,012
Come, my child.

145
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:24,484
Come.

146
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:35,095
Come, my child.

147
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:36,063
I'm coming!

148
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:43,370
No matter how delicious
the food is in the dream,

149
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:46,206
the flavours stay behind
in the dream.

150
00:11:46,974 --> 00:11:49,443
When you wake up, it's all gone.

151
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:54,581
Only kids like him
can dream of food.

152
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,452
By the way, do you know
which place this is?

153
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:03,056
Yes.

154
00:12:03,657 --> 00:12:06,026
Badavarabandu Anathashrama.

155
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:08,262
Hey, wake up!

156
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:10,364
Mallesha, Rudresha,
Gowreesha, Nandeesha...

157
00:12:10,464 --> 00:12:11,665
Hey, Jagdeesha...

158
00:12:12,366 --> 00:12:15,435
The boy who ate well
in his dreams last night...

159
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,871
that is me.

160
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:19,806
Spare one bucket of hot water...

161
00:12:20,474 --> 00:12:23,911
[all reciting song] In the lotus with one petal

162
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:28,849
As a child, I didn't know any place
other than this orphanage.

163
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,117
[singing]

164
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:33,787
The person over here...
Not him, he's geometry.

165
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:35,322
Pan the camera up.

166
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:37,057
He is the one.

167
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:40,794
He is everything to me.
My only family.

168
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:43,897
Appayya, a father figure to us.

169
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:50,137
I always had three meals a day
and slept well back then.

170
00:12:50,571 --> 00:12:51,238
But...

171
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:53,740
Sir, why do you prepare
the same food every day?

172
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:59,646
I'm not your mom to cook varieties
of food and serve you every day.

173
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:02,950
Do you expect me to feed you
like your mom? Get lost!

174
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:09,156
On one side, there was
this unlucky boy, who never

175
00:13:09,223 --> 00:13:12,192
tasted the food prepared
by his mother with love.

176
00:13:12,693 --> 00:13:15,229
On the other side of this round Earth,

177
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:18,498
not very far from here,

178
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:21,602
she had mother's food hour after hour.

179
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:23,804
Freshly churned butter.

180
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:27,908
The sweet sizzling sound
of the mouth-watering dosa,

181
00:13:28,742 --> 00:13:31,812
chunks of butter melting on the hot dosa,

182
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:34,081
with the aromatic chutney powder on it.

183
00:13:34,515 --> 00:13:35,349
[slurps]

184
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:39,620
Every morsel feels like...

185
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,956
a step closer to heaven.

186
00:13:43,724 --> 00:13:49,630
Who is this virtuous soul concealed
within the warmth of her mother's love?

187
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:55,302
[singing lullaby]

188
00:13:55,369 --> 00:13:57,337
Who is this little one

189
00:13:57,404 --> 00:14:01,108
sleeping peacefully to the tunes
of her mother's lullaby?

190
00:14:01,742 --> 00:14:05,345
My name is Vedavalli Varadharajan.

191
00:14:06,647 --> 00:14:10,617
Yes, she is Vedavalli,
aka "Dummi Valli."

192
00:14:12,753 --> 00:14:15,989
The daughter
of Bombe Iyengar bakery's owner.

193
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,425
This is Bombe Iyengar,

194
00:14:18,492 --> 00:14:20,727
aka Varadharajan Iyengar.

195
00:14:21,662 --> 00:14:24,565
An expert at baking cakes.

196
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:27,734
Though he sells confectioneries
for a living,

197
00:14:28,402 --> 00:14:30,504
he is a bitter person.

198
00:14:30,804 --> 00:14:33,974
-Don't put anything over here...-His day doesn't go by without a fight.

199
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:34,942
I said leave!

200
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:39,546
Be it the neighbouring biriyani shop
Pappanna, or his own daughter, Veda.

201
00:14:39,613 --> 00:14:41,815
He's rude to everyone.
-[in Tamil] Hey, what have you done?

202
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:43,884
You've ruined everything.

203
00:14:44,585 --> 00:14:45,385
[in Tamil] Get lost.

204
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:47,487
[Saraswathi singing]

205
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:57,965
You must be wondering why I'm narrating
this story to you?

206
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:01,635
Everything prepared
at Bombe Iyengar bakery

207
00:15:01,702 --> 00:15:04,404
is quite famous
and incredibly tasty.

208
00:15:05,806 --> 00:15:09,009
He who extracts honey
would lick a little off his hands.

209
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:14,081
Similarly, Valli has to taste everything
that is prepared at the bakery.

210
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:17,518
Nobody can stop her
from doing that.

211
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:20,487
I'll complain to your father.

212
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:24,157
Valli does not care for threats at all.

213
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:26,527
But...

214
00:15:27,461 --> 00:15:28,729
her shenanigans,

215
00:15:29,897 --> 00:15:31,732
her father's anger...

216
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:33,066
Veda!

217
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:35,302
and the punishments...

218
00:15:35,369 --> 00:15:38,772
when things went out of control,
their lives started to go downhill.

219
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:40,107
[crying]

220
00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:44,311
Disciplining is a part
of child's upbringing, agreed.

221
00:15:44,378 --> 00:15:47,014
But when the punishment
crosses all limits,

222
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,082
a father won't remain a father anymore,

223
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:50,684
he turns into a monster.

224
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:55,022
He becomes Hitler.

225
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:08,602
[indistinct chatter]

226
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:14,975
[Veda wailing]

227
00:16:21,715 --> 00:16:26,987
What impact would such punishments
must have had on that poor soul?

228
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:28,755
-Think about it.
-What are you looking at?

229
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:31,225
Get some water.
Look, how she's sweating.

230
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,594
Hey! Look... don't...

231
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:37,598
You're interfering when I'm trying
to teach her a lesson.

232
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,032
[sobbing] [in Tamil]
I understand everything.

233
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:40,734
This is how

234
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:44,438
we were growing up
in our respective homes.

235
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:47,908
Our relationship was like

236
00:16:48,909 --> 00:16:49,977
the mountain gooseberry,

237
00:16:50,944 --> 00:16:52,079
and sea salt.

238
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,648
This was our relationship.

239
00:16:56,817 --> 00:17:01,455
To pickle the gooseberries
and the salt together

240
00:17:01,989 --> 00:17:03,290
spice is necessary, right?

241
00:17:03,991 --> 00:17:04,992
He is that spice.

242
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:06,460
Kenda,

243
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:08,595
aka Kendaganna.

244
00:17:08,662 --> 00:17:09,830
Hey!

245
00:17:09,897 --> 00:17:12,165
I'm an orphan by birth,

246
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:14,568
but Kenda is by circumstances.

247
00:17:15,002 --> 00:17:16,703
Where there is ember,
there needs to be a spark,

248
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:20,140
and that spark has to be ignited.

249
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:23,310
[boys clamouring]

250
00:17:23,844 --> 00:17:26,046
And the fire was lit.

251
00:17:26,647 --> 00:17:29,283
Leave... I will hit you! Hey!

252
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:32,286
Do you know at what moment
this fight took place?

253
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,857
Guilty of whacking
Kenda's face... [chuckles]

254
00:17:36,924 --> 00:17:39,793
Latthesha made a roti for him.

255
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:42,963
Perhaps, that was moment

256
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:46,166
a cook in Latthesha was born.

257
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:50,637
You shouldn't fight with anyone.

258
00:17:50,704 --> 00:17:52,506
You should make rotis for me every day?

259
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:55,242
Okay.

260
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:09,556
How is the roti?

261
00:18:10,824 --> 00:18:11,725
Tastes like feet.

262
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:25,606
Bad company turned the monk vile,

263
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,574
Kenda's influence
on Latthesha turned him...

264
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:31,645
-Want something?
-Like you have money!

265
00:18:32,045 --> 00:18:33,280
It's not money that you need...

266
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:36,917
When we were blissfully
indulging in our shenanigans,

267
00:18:36,984 --> 00:18:37,985
little did I know...

268
00:18:38,986 --> 00:18:43,290
the most important person in my life
will be somewhere there.

269
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,929
It was the auspicious day
of Krishna Janmashtami.

270
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:52,533
At the temple of Lord Krishna
the preserver of the world.

271
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:58,805
We, the participants of this Cosmic drama,
were ready with our costumes...

272
00:18:59,373 --> 00:19:03,143
And God lifted the curtains.

273
00:19:03,577 --> 00:19:08,682
When it was time for Latthesha
and Valli's life to take a drastic turn

274
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:14,388
Latthesha was destined
to do what he did.

275
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,627
-Do you really want it?
-Mmm.

276
00:19:29,136 --> 00:19:32,239
By stealing the butter
meant for someone else

277
00:19:32,706 --> 00:19:35,576
Latthesha became indebted forever.

278
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:41,648
And Kenda
was the perfect partner in crime.

279
00:19:42,115 --> 00:19:46,019
-Come on, Kenda. Time to go
-I'm coming. Wait for me.

280
00:19:46,086 --> 00:19:50,157
But little did we know that,
this act of mischief

281
00:19:50,224 --> 00:19:55,162
would bring about
such a drastic change in her life.

282
00:19:59,433 --> 00:20:01,068
[indistinct chatter]

283
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:04,805
[in Tamil] No, Dad, it's not me.

284
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:10,844
Dad, honestly, I didn't do it!

285
00:20:10,911 --> 00:20:12,913
[in Tamil] What's wrong?

286
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,949
[crying] Mom, I didn't do it.

287
00:20:17,084 --> 00:20:19,353
-Please, Dad!
-Shh.

288
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:25,225
[screaming and talking indistinctly]

289
00:20:28,362 --> 00:20:30,030
[Veda crying]

290
00:20:31,331 --> 00:20:33,934
Swerve it! Swerve it faster!

291
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:36,203
[both screaming]

292
00:20:38,505 --> 00:20:40,908
-Listen, stop it.
-Swerve it faster!

293
00:20:40,974 --> 00:20:42,476
[in Tamil]Be quiet!

294
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:46,113
-Dad, please!
-How dare you lie?

295
00:20:46,914 --> 00:20:48,849
Mom, I'm scared.

296
00:21:13,207 --> 00:21:15,108
[both screaming]

297
00:21:15,175 --> 00:21:16,844
[crying]

298
00:21:17,878 --> 00:21:19,746
[straining]

299
00:21:35,996 --> 00:21:38,265
Then what happened?

300
00:21:39,199 --> 00:21:41,201
Then... [chuckles]

301
00:21:41,268 --> 00:21:42,736
BHEEMASENA NALAMAHARAJA

302
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:45,973
We met after 15 long years.

303
00:21:46,273 --> 00:21:51,778
And in those 15 years,
a lot had changed in Latthesha's life.

304
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:56,116
Each grain of rice

305
00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:00,821
has two names written on it

306
00:22:01,355 --> 00:22:07,361
one belongs to the diner
and the other, the chef's

307
00:22:11,198 --> 00:22:13,233
Sir, are you the cook?

308
00:22:16,036 --> 00:22:20,040
I love cooking, sir.
I want to be a cook, sir.

309
00:22:20,607 --> 00:22:21,708
Will you teach me?

310
00:22:25,879 --> 00:22:26,780
Sir...

311
00:22:27,114 --> 00:22:31,351
There is great joy in learning

312
00:22:31,485 --> 00:22:35,889
but you will be in trouble
if you forget the recipe

313
00:22:35,956 --> 00:22:40,494
There is great joy in learning

314
00:22:40,561 --> 00:22:44,464
Can't I stay here
if I want to learn how to cook, Appayya?

315
00:22:45,098 --> 00:22:50,537
How long would
This relationship stretch up to?

316
00:22:50,604 --> 00:22:53,640
-Be happy.
-Whoo!

317
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:57,811
It was a treat for the eyes and palate...

318
00:22:57,878 --> 00:22:59,947
Hey, buddy, just come with me.

319
00:23:00,013 --> 00:23:01,415
The world is a big place.

320
00:23:03,317 --> 00:23:07,087
It was a treat for the eyes and palate...

321
00:23:07,154 --> 00:23:09,223
Bro, where did you find this swamp?

322
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:12,860
He is an all-rounder
He can cook North, South, Chinese, sir.

323
00:23:12,926 --> 00:23:15,596
And he has 12 years of experience
as a cook.

324
00:23:19,366 --> 00:23:20,434
Here's the kitchen, bro.

325
00:23:20,868 --> 00:23:26,106
There's no one to tell you
how to cook now.

326
00:23:26,874 --> 00:23:28,542
It's up to you.

327
00:23:28,709 --> 00:23:32,913
Every story has

328
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:36,783
Scores of characters

329
00:23:37,818 --> 00:23:42,155
Irrespective of their roles

330
00:23:42,322 --> 00:23:45,826
They all must perform.

331
00:23:45,893 --> 00:23:46,860
One minute...

332
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,595
I understood your story.

333
00:23:49,496 --> 00:23:50,564
Who is that girl?

334
00:23:51,198 --> 00:23:52,065
How did she look?

335
00:23:52,132 --> 00:23:54,902
There is life, if you live well...

336
00:23:54,968 --> 00:23:56,670
That's her.

337
00:23:56,737 --> 00:24:01,308
Else just a bag of misery

338
00:24:03,076 --> 00:24:05,145
Please, continue.
Now I can follow the story.

339
00:24:05,212 --> 00:24:08,215
How many pillars to support...

340
00:24:08,282 --> 00:24:09,283
Please, tell.

341
00:24:09,349 --> 00:24:11,518
This hanging bridge?

342
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:14,621
As many as one recalls...

343
00:24:14,688 --> 00:24:16,790
-Hey, walk slowly!
-Sorry, sorry, sorry.

344
00:24:16,857 --> 00:24:18,692
Hello, aunty.

345
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:20,093
Hello, Anand.

346
00:24:20,427 --> 00:24:21,428
[smacks lips] It's Aravind.

347
00:24:22,529 --> 00:24:23,330
Aravind.

348
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:24,965
You had coffee, right?

349
00:24:27,668 --> 00:24:30,137
Though it sounds like a cliche,

350
00:24:30,204 --> 00:24:32,573
will you sing a song
as per our tradition?

351
00:24:33,073 --> 00:24:35,576
-Oh, come on. I can't.
-Hey! You can try.

352
00:24:36,076 --> 00:24:37,211
[in Tamil] Sing a song.

353
00:24:38,846 --> 00:24:43,417
Oh, Lord Krishna, please come

354
00:24:44,852 --> 00:24:48,522
Oh, Lord Krishna, please come

355
00:24:49,289 --> 00:24:53,961
Come seek refuge at your devotee's house

356
00:24:54,027 --> 00:24:56,897
Oh, Lord Krishna...

357
00:24:56,997 --> 00:24:58,232
[coughing]

358
00:25:02,703 --> 00:25:03,804
[in Tamil] Here.

359
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:10,143
Krishna, what is this?

360
00:25:12,112 --> 00:25:15,215
"A boon to tickling throats,
Ananda cough Syrup."

361
00:25:16,416 --> 00:25:20,988
Come please us
With your alluring appearance

362
00:25:21,054 --> 00:25:26,560
No match to you in this vast world

363
00:25:27,227 --> 00:25:27,995
Sorry, mom.

364
00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:30,864
-Oh, mother...
-Hey, Valli, what are you doing?

365
00:25:35,068 --> 00:25:36,236
Look, Anand,

366
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:39,039
I wanted to tell you this at work itself.

367
00:25:39,306 --> 00:25:41,375
But you are too dumb to understand it.

368
00:25:42,242 --> 00:25:46,446
That's why I invited you home
to give you a live demo.

369
00:25:49,283 --> 00:25:50,384
Because...

370
00:25:51,285 --> 00:25:52,319
in this house...

371
00:25:53,187 --> 00:25:58,192
Father and daughter
don't see eye to eye.

372
00:25:58,992 --> 00:26:01,862
-You know why?
-Why?

373
00:26:04,097 --> 00:26:08,135
Can anyone accept
a murderer as their father?

374
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:11,538
Is it possible?

375
00:26:12,706 --> 00:26:16,343
[singing] The snake's spite
lasts for 12 years,

376
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:20,914
my rage goes on for 1000 years,
you rogue.

377
00:26:20,981 --> 00:26:24,518
-Bombe Iyengar, come here!
-Shh.

378
00:26:24,852 --> 00:26:27,721
If she stays here,
there'll be a war.

379
00:26:27,788 --> 00:26:29,823
Take her to your home.

380
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:32,693
I can't take her home,
my dad will be furious.

381
00:26:33,327 --> 00:26:34,661
-[line ringing]
-Hello?

382
00:26:35,362 --> 00:26:36,864
Sir, are there any rooms available
in your resort?

383
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,999
Sir, is there a room available
in your resort?

384
00:26:39,566 --> 00:26:41,401
Sir, do you have a room?

385
00:26:41,468 --> 00:26:42,302
Oh, there is?

386
00:26:43,937 --> 00:26:46,006
One has to pay back
the debt, right, ma'am?

387
00:26:46,607 --> 00:26:50,611
That brought us together after 15 years.

388
00:26:54,414 --> 00:26:56,049
Valli-Latthesha,

389
00:26:56,116 --> 00:27:00,320
the second part
to the drama had begun.

390
00:27:06,693 --> 00:27:08,028
[gasping]

391
00:27:37,891 --> 00:27:40,260
[crying]

392
00:27:42,963 --> 00:27:44,865
The graceful laughter

393
00:27:45,499 --> 00:27:47,634
suddenly turned into grievance,

394
00:27:47,901 --> 00:27:49,636
It couldn't understand why.

395
00:27:51,438 --> 00:27:53,707
[crying] Mom, please come here.

396
00:28:01,348 --> 00:28:03,851
Where did this part
of the story take place?

397
00:28:04,518 --> 00:28:06,620
In the woods beside the river.

398
00:28:10,023 --> 00:28:12,025
And in the moor amidst woods.

399
00:28:12,626 --> 00:28:15,062
That moor was called Nadi Moola Resort.

400
00:28:15,128 --> 00:28:16,230
Pass me the water.

401
00:28:16,296 --> 00:28:19,066
-Here it is.
-You have to be agile.

402
00:28:21,268 --> 00:28:23,070
You should at least pretend
that you're scared.

403
00:28:23,136 --> 00:28:24,137
You're a spoilsport.

404
00:28:24,705 --> 00:28:26,006
What did you say your name was?

405
00:28:27,608 --> 00:28:28,408
Latthesha.

406
00:28:29,209 --> 00:28:31,111
-What?
-My name's Latthesha.

407
00:28:32,446 --> 00:28:36,817
She's quite weird.
One moment she was very cheerful.

408
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,622
[screams]

409
00:28:43,724 --> 00:28:48,896
and the next, she hid her pain under
the mask of happiness.

410
00:28:49,463 --> 00:28:52,833
She had the rage to turn
whoever came before her to ashes.

411
00:28:54,768 --> 00:28:58,071
We were four boys living in this moor.

412
00:28:59,072 --> 00:29:01,642
And she was the only girl amongst us.

413
00:29:02,376 --> 00:29:03,844
She can definitely do it.

414
00:29:03,911 --> 00:29:05,746
Look at her face,
she looks really scared.

415
00:29:05,812 --> 00:29:07,881
-She will do it.
-No, she's scared...

416
00:29:07,948 --> 00:29:10,150
She was fickle minded.

417
00:29:10,217 --> 00:29:14,021
Her behaviour was
extremely unpredictable.

418
00:29:14,988 --> 00:29:18,525
Are you out of your mind!
What if I drown to death?

419
00:29:18,592 --> 00:29:22,196
Why did you bet in the first place?
Hold on to the rope properly!

420
00:29:23,897 --> 00:29:25,465
[indistinct screaming]

421
00:29:26,133 --> 00:29:28,669
Ma'am, you have to pay
100 bucks if you lose.

422
00:29:28,735 --> 00:29:31,305
You bastards, I'm going
to beat you up.

423
00:29:31,371 --> 00:29:32,239
Hell with your bets.

424
00:29:32,306 --> 00:29:34,041
-Having fun?
-[laughing]

425
00:29:34,107 --> 00:29:35,209
[shrieks]

426
00:29:44,585 --> 00:29:46,453
[screaming]

427
00:29:47,187 --> 00:29:48,889
Like this wasn't enough,

428
00:29:48,956 --> 00:29:51,992
we heard strange stories about her.

429
00:29:52,392 --> 00:29:55,929
Her mother drowned when she was a kid.

430
00:29:56,363 --> 00:29:59,132
She is scared
of water and boats. Please.

431
00:29:59,833 --> 00:30:01,768
Calm and composed in the day.

432
00:30:02,102 --> 00:30:05,539
Rage and fury comes out in the night.

433
00:30:05,939 --> 00:30:09,209
It all felt like a bad dream.

434
00:30:09,276 --> 00:30:10,644
Here, have this hot kotte kadubu.

435
00:30:11,845 --> 00:30:12,746
What's your story, ma'am?

436
00:30:13,747 --> 00:30:15,983
Mine? There's no story.

437
00:30:16,617 --> 00:30:18,785
There's no story? Impossible.

438
00:30:20,053 --> 00:30:23,657
I've none! I don't remember anything!
I don't want this!

439
00:30:24,525 --> 00:30:25,626
Ma'am...

440
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,396
She had come here with a huge baggage.

441
00:30:29,463 --> 00:30:30,430
Hold on.

442
00:30:31,265 --> 00:30:32,799
-Just a minute.
-Tell me.

443
00:30:33,734 --> 00:30:36,203
Are you narrating this story to me or...

444
00:30:37,104 --> 00:30:37,871
Veda.

445
00:30:39,239 --> 00:30:40,474
Or to Veda?

446
00:30:40,908 --> 00:30:44,811
Latthesha is narrating
Veda's story to Sarah.

447
00:30:45,445 --> 00:30:46,346
When did you come here?

448
00:30:47,247 --> 00:30:49,550
I was here all along.

449
00:30:49,616 --> 00:30:51,285
Food is great, so is the story!

450
00:30:51,351 --> 00:30:52,853
-Please continue.
-Yes.

451
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,789
Continue. Come on.

452
00:30:56,523 --> 00:30:58,659
Milk is on the stove.

453
00:30:58,725 --> 00:31:01,228
Look after it. Breakfast is ready.

454
00:31:01,595 --> 00:31:02,696
-Serve it.
-Okay.

455
00:31:03,764 --> 00:31:05,632
[indistinct chattering]

456
00:31:10,204 --> 00:31:13,040
Because of you I'm going to get
earful from both our parents.

457
00:31:13,106 --> 00:31:14,808
I can't take it anymore. Let's go!

458
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:18,212
Ma'am, let her stay back today.
It's okay.

459
00:31:18,946 --> 00:31:21,582
Latthesha's wish is my command.
I'll stay. Give it back

460
00:31:21,648 --> 00:31:25,986
-Have this, ma'am. You'll feel better.
-Okay.

461
00:31:28,355 --> 00:31:29,223
Hello.

462
00:31:29,323 --> 00:31:31,558
She isn't a simple girl at all.

463
00:31:33,126 --> 00:31:36,897
Don't read too much
into her smile, okay?

464
00:31:42,436 --> 00:31:47,040
I use my hand to measure ingredients

465
00:31:47,107 --> 00:31:49,209
while I'm cooking, ma'am.

466
00:31:51,245 --> 00:31:56,116
My eyes can see
the true nature of a person.

467
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:59,453
You don't have to
squeeze in there. Get in the back.

468
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,354
That's okay, madam.

469
00:32:04,157 --> 00:32:05,692
Please sit comfortably, madam.

470
00:32:06,326 --> 00:32:07,361
I'm fine.

471
00:32:07,661 --> 00:32:09,730
What the problem, bro?

472
00:32:10,063 --> 00:32:13,700
This is what happens when three people
occupy two seats.

473
00:32:14,368 --> 00:32:16,670
Latthesh, where are we going?

474
00:32:16,737 --> 00:32:17,538
Surprise!

475
00:32:19,606 --> 00:32:22,709
Madam, this is my world!

476
00:32:23,143 --> 00:32:25,913
-What?
-Yes, come.

477
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,748
Come on, ma'am.

478
00:32:27,814 --> 00:32:29,316
Let's go.

479
00:32:29,383 --> 00:32:32,386
-I'm not going anywhere.
-Jai Bajrangbali!

480
00:32:32,452 --> 00:32:33,820
[people clamouring]

481
00:32:33,887 --> 00:32:35,255
How much does it cost?

482
00:32:35,322 --> 00:32:37,791
-That's 150!
-What? 150 for this?

483
00:32:38,592 --> 00:32:39,593
What?

484
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:40,827
How much is this?

485
00:32:41,528 --> 00:32:42,596
How much for this?

486
00:32:42,663 --> 00:32:44,131
This one? That's 100.

487
00:32:44,198 --> 00:32:45,399
-What, 100?
-Yes.

488
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:49,036
Stop fooling me, okay?

489
00:32:49,102 --> 00:32:50,804
I'll pay 50 for it.

490
00:32:50,871 --> 00:32:53,073
You already owe me 10 bucks.
Pay up.

491
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,309
-What, ten bucks?
-Pay me first.

492
00:32:56,043 --> 00:32:57,444
Here, take this.

493
00:32:57,811 --> 00:32:58,946
-Give me that.
-That one?

494
00:32:59,112 --> 00:33:00,414
-I won't.
-Why?

495
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,217
Fish isn't cheap, go to the stream
and fish all you want.

496
00:33:03,283 --> 00:33:05,619
Fine! I'll buy a bigger one
than this.

497
00:33:05,686 --> 00:33:08,055
Sure, go ahead.

498
00:33:08,121 --> 00:33:09,223
Come, ma'am.

499
00:33:09,289 --> 00:33:10,557
What did you come here for?

500
00:33:10,624 --> 00:33:13,694
Get out of here
if you aren't buying anything.

501
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,129
Leave now.

502
00:33:17,764 --> 00:33:19,032
[groaning]

503
00:33:19,366 --> 00:33:21,735
You came here to buy fish

504
00:33:21,802 --> 00:33:23,937
or to pick a petty fight with that lady?

505
00:33:24,771 --> 00:33:26,206
Let's go!

506
00:33:26,373 --> 00:33:27,975
-To where?
-The stream.

507
00:33:28,709 --> 00:33:29,643
-[groans]
-Come.

508
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:33,680
[indistinct chatter]

509
00:33:35,115 --> 00:33:36,316
Success!

510
00:33:37,351 --> 00:33:38,485
Mr. Latthesh.

511
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,389
What kind of a home do you like?

512
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:45,092
-Me?
-Yeah.

513
00:33:47,828 --> 00:33:50,664
-These hills and rocks...
-Yeah.

514
00:33:51,698 --> 00:33:53,433
the place where it rains all the time,

515
00:33:54,434 --> 00:33:56,103
I don't like them at all.

516
00:33:57,404 --> 00:34:01,308
It stopped raining
and the sun is out.

517
00:34:01,808 --> 00:34:03,310
We are here for more than
two hours now.

518
00:34:04,578 --> 00:34:06,847
Have you ever caught a fish before?

519
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,451
Is this your first time!

520
00:34:12,819 --> 00:34:13,720
Yes, madam.

521
00:34:14,454 --> 00:34:15,756
[groans]

522
00:34:16,657 --> 00:34:18,125
My limbs hurt.

523
00:34:19,493 --> 00:34:20,194
Okay, so...

524
00:34:20,827 --> 00:34:23,063
Tell me what kind of a home do you prefer?

525
00:34:23,997 --> 00:34:25,098
Hold this, I'll tell you.

526
00:34:29,102 --> 00:34:33,473
There should always be people
around my house.

527
00:34:35,042 --> 00:34:38,512
People should be in queue to use the toilet
when I open the door in the morning.

528
00:34:39,947 --> 00:34:43,550
The vegetable and fruit vendor,
the flower seller

529
00:34:43,617 --> 00:34:45,185
should be right outside the house.

530
00:34:45,686 --> 00:34:49,423
I want to see rangolis,
and sight of children's bum being washed.

531
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:52,626
Washing bums?

532
00:34:52,693 --> 00:34:54,628
Yeah, ma'am. That's part of life.

533
00:35:31,198 --> 00:35:33,367
Something's pulling, Latthesha.

534
00:35:37,638 --> 00:35:39,806
Don't let it slip.

535
00:35:39,873 --> 00:35:42,809
It's our lucky day.
Please don't distract me, ma'am.

536
00:35:42,876 --> 00:35:43,844
We got a big catch.

537
00:35:46,847 --> 00:35:50,117
This fish really saved my face...

538
00:35:50,184 --> 00:35:51,852
[laughs]

539
00:35:51,985 --> 00:35:53,120
Well done!

540
00:35:53,787 --> 00:35:55,255
-Mr. Latthesh?
-Yes, ma'am.

541
00:35:55,322 --> 00:35:59,793
If you go to a new place
with a peculiar name like Latthesha,

542
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:03,597
all those little bums out there,

543
00:36:03,664 --> 00:36:07,034
will ruin your name by calling
you Latthesha, Latha, won't they?

544
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:10,370
You're right, ma'am.
It never crossed my mind.

545
00:36:12,005 --> 00:36:14,474
What can be your new name?

546
00:36:16,276 --> 00:36:18,145
If I ever change my name,

547
00:36:19,046 --> 00:36:21,548
I'll change it to Bheemasena Nalamaharaja.

548
00:36:21,615 --> 00:36:22,683
It's good.

549
00:36:22,749 --> 00:36:23,650
Bheemasena... [groans]

550
00:36:25,452 --> 00:36:28,455
There's no need.
Latthesha is good enough.

551
00:36:28,522 --> 00:36:30,023
He likes that name.

552
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:32,259
Let him change
it to Bheemasena Nalamaharaja.

553
00:36:32,326 --> 00:36:34,828
No way. His name's Latthesha.

554
00:36:34,895 --> 00:36:36,230
Bheemasena Nalamaharaja.

555
00:36:36,296 --> 00:36:38,065
-Latthesha!
-Bheemasena Nalamaharaja.

556
00:36:38,131 --> 00:36:39,466
-Latthesha!
-Bheemasena...

557
00:36:39,533 --> 00:36:41,068
Shut up!

558
00:36:43,036 --> 00:36:46,373
If you keep fighting like this,
I'll give myself a nasty name.

559
00:36:47,908 --> 00:36:49,910
-No, she...
-[shushing]

560
00:36:56,116 --> 00:36:58,185
-Hey, tell her to sit down.
-Ma'am, ma'am!

561
00:36:58,952 --> 00:37:01,688
'Bheemasena Nalamaharaja!

562
00:37:02,189 --> 00:37:05,158
Oh-ho!

563
00:37:05,659 --> 00:37:08,395
[indistinctly screaming]

564
00:37:15,102 --> 00:37:20,207
Bheemasena, the king of chefs

565
00:37:23,043 --> 00:37:28,649
All Hail the honour of the
Kuru dynasty, Bheemasena

566
00:37:30,651 --> 00:37:34,821
Bheemasena, the king of chefs

567
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:38,892
What's wrong with you?
Stop overreacting.

568
00:37:39,126 --> 00:37:43,230
By screaming on the streets
you can't change his name, can you?

569
00:37:44,031 --> 00:37:47,267
There's no need to change
his name to Bheemasena Nalamaharaja.

570
00:37:47,701 --> 00:37:49,570
For me, he already is.

571
00:37:50,771 --> 00:37:54,241
-Don't you trust me? Come, I'll show you.
- Let go of my hand.

572
00:38:05,686 --> 00:38:09,122
Hey, that's just a fish.
Stop exaggerating.

573
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:10,724
[groans]

574
00:38:10,824 --> 00:38:13,827
It's just a fish to us.

575
00:38:14,294 --> 00:38:17,297
But he is Bheemasena.

576
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:20,868
Do you know how it appears
to him?

577
00:38:22,536 --> 00:38:26,206
He who smashed the thigh
of the Kuru Prince

578
00:38:26,273 --> 00:38:30,277
Who challenged the game of dice

579
00:38:33,981 --> 00:38:39,253
He who slayed the pervert Kichaka

580
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:42,022
For harassing and assaulting

581
00:38:43,624 --> 00:38:47,528
He who formed a pail of blood

582
00:38:47,594 --> 00:38:52,065
From the chest of the one
Who dragged Panchali

583
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:59,173
He who declared
The battlefield as the kitchen

584
00:39:00,941 --> 00:39:05,345
Bheemasena, the king of chefs

585
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:12,653
[groans] I can't watch this.

586
00:39:13,253 --> 00:39:15,489
The killing and bloodshed is done.

587
00:39:16,123 --> 00:39:19,059
The job of the scientist begins now.

588
00:39:19,626 --> 00:39:21,528
-Scientist?
-Yes.

589
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:25,632
This salmon fish has
to be marinated with some salt.

590
00:39:25,699 --> 00:39:28,335
Add a little ginger-garlic paste.

591
00:39:28,402 --> 00:39:31,738
Then add a dash of garam masala
made of cardamom,

592
00:39:31,805 --> 00:39:34,374
cinnamon, cloves, pepper and chilies.

593
00:39:34,441 --> 00:39:38,545
And finally, fry it in groundnut oil
at 300° Celsius.

594
00:39:38,612 --> 00:39:40,414
And then your fish fry is ready.

595
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,648
[gasping]

596
00:39:44,885 --> 00:39:46,687
It's not what you think.

597
00:39:53,727 --> 00:39:58,999
The King of the Sun dynasty,
The author of Pakadarpana

598
00:40:01,435 --> 00:40:06,273
The King of the Sun dynasty,
The author of Pakadarpana

599
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:11,044
He blends in the six tastes
To create a flavoursome delight

600
00:40:11,111 --> 00:40:16,717
He who satisfies the soul and the palate

601
00:40:16,783 --> 00:40:20,554
He is Nalamaharaja

602
00:40:22,322 --> 00:40:27,728
It is Bheemasena Nalamaharaja

603
00:40:29,963 --> 00:40:34,735
It is Bheemasena Nalamaharaja

604
00:40:37,538 --> 00:40:40,974
Looks tasty, bro!
I'll drench myself in drink today.

605
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:43,243
Ma'am... Ma'am...

606
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:44,411
What about us?

607
00:40:45,779 --> 00:40:48,782
I always dreamt of having
this fish.

608
00:40:48,982 --> 00:40:51,084
I'm not going to share this
with anyone.

609
00:40:51,151 --> 00:40:53,687
You won't be able
to finish the whole fish.

610
00:40:53,754 --> 00:40:55,822
I swear by the God in your amulet.

611
00:40:56,156 --> 00:40:57,491
I bet 1000 bucks.

612
00:40:57,558 --> 00:40:58,825
Oh, yeah?

613
00:40:58,892 --> 00:41:04,097
-I won't you let you touch the fish.
-Hey, stop running, come back!

614
00:41:04,164 --> 00:41:05,532
I will not share. Period.

615
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:09,269
I won't even give you a tiny bit.
The whole fish is mine.

616
00:41:09,336 --> 00:41:10,704
Thanks, Latthesha.

617
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,708
Are you blind?

618
00:41:14,775 --> 00:41:16,877
Watch where you're going.
Are you blind or what?

619
00:41:16,944 --> 00:41:18,645
She's a lost cause.

620
00:41:18,712 --> 00:41:21,815
Ma'am, that's all right.
They are just playing.

621
00:41:22,282 --> 00:41:24,618
Hey, don't you want the fish?

622
00:41:25,118 --> 00:41:26,520
Let it go, bro.

623
00:41:26,854 --> 00:41:28,622
How come you're doing the laundry?

624
00:41:28,689 --> 00:41:30,090
Get out of here.

625
00:41:30,157 --> 00:41:32,192
Run. He's gone crazy.

626
00:41:44,571 --> 00:41:46,006
Shameless.

627
00:41:46,139 --> 00:41:48,041
When will you stop
humiliating me?

628
00:41:53,914 --> 00:41:54,982
Where is your amulet?

629
00:41:55,616 --> 00:41:59,353
It's just an amulet, not gold or silver.

630
00:41:59,419 --> 00:42:00,821
I don't know, madam.

631
00:42:01,154 --> 00:42:04,191
I'm pleading you... Please!

632
00:42:04,258 --> 00:42:05,392
I don't know, madam.

633
00:42:05,459 --> 00:42:08,529
-I want my amulet back, please.
-Oh, good Lord, why will we take it?

634
00:42:08,795 --> 00:42:11,598
-Hey, do you have it?
-No, dude, I don't.

635
00:42:11,999 --> 00:42:13,567
She went with the fish that way,

636
00:42:13,634 --> 00:42:15,669
and ran into Kenda,

637
00:42:15,736 --> 00:42:17,304
and then he put the towel over here,

638
00:42:17,371 --> 00:42:19,640
and then he smacked us
so we got away from there.

639
00:42:19,706 --> 00:42:22,142
We really have no clue about it, ma'am.

640
00:42:22,209 --> 00:42:23,744
[indistinct chattering]

641
00:42:33,187 --> 00:42:34,488
[gasps]

642
00:42:34,855 --> 00:42:36,023
Where did you find this?

643
00:42:38,125 --> 00:42:41,328
It is not important.
We found it, right?

644
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:46,500
I know. Those guys didn't take it.

645
00:42:46,934 --> 00:42:48,202
Please don't probe further on this matter.

646
00:42:58,212 --> 00:42:59,346
She stayed here for five days,

647
00:43:00,647 --> 00:43:06,486
and in those five days I saw laughter,
sadness, anger, fights, etc.

648
00:43:06,954 --> 00:43:08,822
And it was time for her to leave.

649
00:43:08,889 --> 00:43:09,990
[crying]

650
00:43:10,791 --> 00:43:13,594
What are you doing here, madam?
Everyone's waiting for you.

651
00:43:19,266 --> 00:43:24,037
These five days were the best
days of my life.

652
00:43:25,739 --> 00:43:27,875
Please stop it, madam.

653
00:43:31,612 --> 00:43:32,813
You don't understand.

654
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:34,648
Madam...

655
00:43:35,949 --> 00:43:37,184
Everyone's waiting...

656
00:43:44,391 --> 00:43:45,993
You're sending me away, too?

657
00:43:46,793 --> 00:43:47,594
So soon?

658
00:43:48,295 --> 00:43:49,196
No, madam...

659
00:43:56,803 --> 00:43:58,805
Thank you very much.

660
00:44:13,353 --> 00:44:16,890
Where are you going?
We're getting late already!

661
00:44:18,292 --> 00:44:19,693
What are you up to?

662
00:44:25,732 --> 00:44:26,700
What happened, madam?

663
00:44:29,303 --> 00:44:30,771
[crying]

664
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:55,562
Had she left without saying anything,
this story would've not continued.

665
00:44:56,063 --> 00:44:59,333
Now, when I sit down
and put together the pieces.

666
00:44:59,733 --> 00:45:01,268
The thanks she said,

667
00:45:01,735 --> 00:45:05,105
and her hug, both

668
00:45:05,639 --> 00:45:07,975
had the power to wreck me.

669
00:45:10,544 --> 00:45:12,045
Which is why I told you that

670
00:45:12,446 --> 00:45:14,681
thanks changed my life.

671
00:45:14,748 --> 00:45:15,716
Dose?

672
00:45:15,983 --> 00:45:17,751
-Faster.
-Dose.

673
00:45:17,851 --> 00:45:19,186
Yes, sir, two minutes.

674
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,296
Salt, sour, sweet, bitter,
pungent and astringent.

675
00:45:29,363 --> 00:45:30,597
All the six tastes are in this.

676
00:45:30,664 --> 00:45:33,367
Anyone can cook using these.

677
00:45:33,867 --> 00:45:37,905
But you have
a special ingredient with you.

678
00:45:37,971 --> 00:45:39,373
And that is love.

679
00:45:40,574 --> 00:45:43,277
I looked for it everywhere
but didn't find it.

680
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:46,213
You have it in you in abundance.

681
00:45:48,515 --> 00:45:50,250
Hello? Hi, madam.

682
00:45:50,584 --> 00:45:52,019
Yes, madam, just hold on.

683
00:45:52,085 --> 00:45:53,554
-Bro?
-Who is it?

684
00:45:57,658 --> 00:45:58,559
Hello... Hello, ma'am.

685
00:45:59,293 --> 00:46:00,761
-Give me the phone.-Tell me, ma'am.

686
00:46:00,827 --> 00:46:02,896
You shouldn't call him. Give it back!

687
00:46:04,097 --> 00:46:05,933
Don't ruin his life.

688
00:46:05,999 --> 00:46:07,334
You shouldn't call him.

689
00:46:07,401 --> 00:46:08,468
-Kick me.
-Buffalo...

690
00:46:08,535 --> 00:46:09,937
-I won't give you the phone.
-You owl!

691
00:46:10,938 --> 00:46:13,941
You have a special ingredient with you.

692
00:46:15,442 --> 00:46:16,643
That is love.

693
00:46:23,517 --> 00:46:26,220
Bro, Kenda is calling,

694
00:46:26,286 --> 00:46:28,255
he wants you to come right away.

695
00:46:28,655 --> 00:46:29,957
Get lost!

696
00:46:37,397 --> 00:46:39,266
[mobile ringing]

697
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:54,481
Hello.

698
00:46:54,948 --> 00:46:55,849
Hold on, ma'am.

699
00:46:56,483 --> 00:46:58,352
Where have you been, Latthesh?

700
00:46:59,453 --> 00:47:01,221
I've been trying to reach you
from so many days.

701
00:47:01,855 --> 00:47:03,023
-Ma'am...-Never mind.

702
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:06,059
I want you to come
to Bengaluru today. Now.

703
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,228
-Bengaluru?
-Yes.

704
00:47:08,428 --> 00:47:11,164
I have an awesome surprise for you!

705
00:47:11,231 --> 00:47:12,332
Everything is ready.

706
00:47:12,399 --> 00:47:14,134
-We are just waiting for you to come.
-Hello.

707
00:47:15,402 --> 00:47:17,204
You are coming today, okay?

708
00:47:17,304 --> 00:47:20,207
-You must. That's all.
-Okay, ma'am.

709
00:47:20,908 --> 00:47:22,409
It's a wrong number.

710
00:47:24,211 --> 00:47:25,145
Wrong number.

711
00:47:26,413 --> 00:47:27,581
Are you in love?

712
00:47:28,849 --> 00:47:29,950
Nothing like that, bro.

713
00:47:30,484 --> 00:47:33,420
Are you going to fall
for the hug and this invitation?

714
00:47:33,487 --> 00:47:34,555
Well...

715
00:47:39,526 --> 00:47:40,627
Even I've kissed you now.

716
00:47:40,861 --> 00:47:41,595
Stay here.

717
00:47:43,163 --> 00:47:44,164
Have you lost your mind?

718
00:47:50,003 --> 00:47:51,772
[snoring]

719
00:47:57,277 --> 00:47:59,146
Will you go with me?

720
00:48:02,916 --> 00:48:03,784
You can't, can you?

721
00:48:12,292 --> 00:48:13,727
Are you going to leave me?

722
00:48:16,196 --> 00:48:19,266
She called him up
and he's leaving with a bag.

723
00:48:19,366 --> 00:48:21,535
If you leave, who will make rotis for me?

724
00:48:23,504 --> 00:48:26,206
Stop staring. You're acting
like you're possessed.

725
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,908
That's why you've gone crazy.

726
00:48:28,275 --> 00:48:30,844
I know how to straighten you out
and bring you back here.

727
00:48:30,911 --> 00:48:31,612
Let's go!

728
00:48:34,915 --> 00:48:35,649
Come!

729
00:48:37,885 --> 00:48:39,753
You can't differentiate between
the right and the wrong.

730
00:48:40,888 --> 00:48:44,391
They say do not look for the source
of a woman's psyche.

731
00:48:45,125 --> 00:48:46,693
But I wasn't ready to listen.

732
00:48:47,227 --> 00:48:48,695
To look for that source,

733
00:48:48,762 --> 00:48:50,797
I left Nadi Moola.

734
00:48:52,566 --> 00:48:55,969
The third part
of the drama has begun.

735
00:48:56,036 --> 00:48:56,703
BHEEMASENA NALAMAHARAJA

736
00:48:56,770 --> 00:48:57,738
Here are the keys.

737
00:48:57,804 --> 00:49:00,307
I want you to serve
thousands of people.

738
00:49:00,374 --> 00:49:04,044
Thousands of people
in this city

739
00:49:04,111 --> 00:49:06,613
crave for good, tasty food,
you know.

740
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:09,449
You have to go to them.

741
00:49:09,516 --> 00:49:11,718
And satisfy their hunger.

742
00:49:12,252 --> 00:49:14,121
And that's why this truck
is called Bheemasena.

743
00:49:14,188 --> 00:49:15,956
'Good food avoids sickness
and good talk avoids quarrel'

744
00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:19,393
You'll feel cold after a cold shower

745
00:49:19,459 --> 00:49:21,995
And you'll feel warm
After a hot water bath

746
00:49:22,062 --> 00:49:24,965
You'll feel cold after a cold shower

747
00:49:25,032 --> 00:49:27,434
And you'll feel warm
After a hot water bath

748
00:49:27,634 --> 00:49:30,103
Walking on a path with trees gives shade

749
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:32,940
If you walk against the path,
It'll cause you pain

750
00:49:33,006 --> 00:49:35,642
If you evolve to be a fat crook,
You'll be punished

751
00:49:35,709 --> 00:49:38,645
If you involve in charity and compassion,
You'll be rewarded

752
00:49:38,712 --> 00:49:41,348
It is true, it is true

753
00:49:41,415 --> 00:49:44,017
It is true, It is true

754
00:49:44,117 --> 00:49:46,820
You'll feel cold after a cold shower

755
00:49:46,887 --> 00:49:49,456
And you'll feel warm
After a hot water bath...

756
00:49:49,523 --> 00:49:50,991
I found this place
in just six hours.

757
00:49:52,059 --> 00:49:53,126
How is it?

758
00:49:55,229 --> 00:49:56,296
Hey!

759
00:49:56,563 --> 00:49:59,499
Are you an animal
to live in a cage like this?

760
00:50:00,534 --> 00:50:02,202
There isn't enough space here
to live.

761
00:50:04,738 --> 00:50:05,873
For broad-minded people,

762
00:50:05,939 --> 00:50:08,809
even a small place like this
can be a mansion, Latthesh.

763
00:50:09,042 --> 00:50:11,111
But for narrow-minded ones...

764
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:14,448
Come with me. I'll show you
the specialty of this place.

765
00:50:17,284 --> 00:50:20,487
Dance instead of sitting

766
00:50:22,689 --> 00:50:26,126
Mesmerize people with the performance

767
00:50:28,295 --> 00:50:31,865
Ankles need anklets

768
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:37,571
And the eyes need kohl

769
00:50:39,139 --> 00:50:42,009
One must earn, save
And become a breadwinner

770
00:50:42,075 --> 00:50:44,978
Money should be earned
And a good persona must be obtained

771
00:50:45,045 --> 00:50:47,648
If you earn and save, you'll be at ease

772
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:53,053
If you run behind Nymphs,
Your life will be ruined

773
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,189
It is true, it is true

774
00:50:55,255 --> 00:50:56,490
It is true...

775
00:50:56,557 --> 00:50:57,991
What do you have to eat?

776
00:50:58,058 --> 00:50:59,826
Raagi mudde and bassaru.

777
00:51:01,195 --> 00:51:03,063
Raagi mudde...

778
00:51:04,731 --> 00:51:06,667
Bro, hold on.

779
00:51:08,735 --> 00:51:09,503
Try it.

780
00:51:09,903 --> 00:51:12,873
Food for your body and soul.

781
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:16,376
You eat raagi mudde

782
00:51:18,412 --> 00:51:22,482
Your health will prosper

783
00:51:23,684 --> 00:51:25,819
Sing a song with the perfect tune...

784
00:51:25,886 --> 00:51:27,221
TODAY'S SPECIAL
'MUDDE GANAPATHI'

785
00:51:29,156 --> 00:51:31,892
It'll turn into a beautiful song

786
00:51:31,959 --> 00:51:34,328
It'll turn into a beautiful song

787
00:51:34,394 --> 00:51:37,030
It'll turn into a beautiful song

788
00:51:37,097 --> 00:51:39,666
It'll turn into a beautiful song

789
00:51:39,967 --> 00:51:44,905
Kannada, Kannada...

790
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:50,978
He's a versatile cook.
No one thinks like him.

791
00:51:53,113 --> 00:51:55,449
He has adapted our culture very well.

792
00:51:55,516 --> 00:51:56,984
It's a fantastic job.

793
00:51:58,752 --> 00:52:00,954
-It's very good.
-We want both pizza, burger and this.

794
00:52:01,021 --> 00:52:04,558
I told you so, didn't I?
It's fantastic, extraordinary.

795
00:52:05,125 --> 00:52:07,227
How do you sell this?

796
00:52:07,294 --> 00:52:09,530
Based on the number of morsels or plates?

797
00:52:10,264 --> 00:52:13,734
Ma'am, can anyone put a price tag
on morsels of love?

798
00:52:14,368 --> 00:52:17,037
You'll feel cold after a cold shower

799
00:52:17,104 --> 00:52:19,806
And you will feel warm
After a hot water bath

800
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:22,676
You'll feel cold after a cold shower

801
00:52:22,743 --> 00:52:25,145
And you will feel warm
After a hot water bath...

802
00:52:26,547 --> 00:52:28,015
There is a small bit
of selfishness from my side.

803
00:52:28,815 --> 00:52:31,318
You tend to find
some kind of a belongingness

804
00:52:31,385 --> 00:52:33,120
in the food he cooks.

805
00:52:33,187 --> 00:52:36,957
So, all those who were deprived
of love in their lives

806
00:52:37,024 --> 00:52:40,360
would feel less lonely.

807
00:52:40,894 --> 00:52:43,564
And get a tint of zeal in their lives.

808
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:44,798
'Mudde Ganapati' is the symbol
of strength and devotion

809
00:52:48,035 --> 00:52:50,571
-Mudde Ganapathi...
-There is plenty. Please wait.

810
00:52:50,637 --> 00:52:53,373
[people clamouring]

811
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:05,085
Finally, he's brought her to the streets.

812
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:08,088
Who are your parents?

813
00:53:08,655 --> 00:53:09,690
What's your caste?

814
00:53:09,756 --> 00:53:11,725
You don't know your caste,
race and you're good-for-nothing

815
00:53:11,792 --> 00:53:13,160
but you want to marry her.

816
00:53:14,862 --> 00:53:16,296
Hey, come here.

817
00:53:16,964 --> 00:53:18,632
Are you better than Anand?

818
00:53:18,699 --> 00:53:20,667
-Uncle, it's Aravind...
-Hey, shut up!

819
00:53:20,734 --> 00:53:22,636
There isn't a better match
for her than you.

820
00:53:22,736 --> 00:53:24,271
You still want to marry her?

821
00:53:26,173 --> 00:53:26,907
Yes!

822
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:31,478
He's the one I'm going to marry.

823
00:53:31,545 --> 00:53:32,846
How's that possible, madam?

824
00:53:33,747 --> 00:53:35,749
-Ma'am, please...
-Don't you want to marry me?

825
00:53:36,884 --> 00:53:38,318
I need to time to think, ma'am.

826
00:53:39,386 --> 00:53:43,423
See, I know their type.
I've seen so many of them.

827
00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:44,658
He will not marry her.

828
00:53:44,725 --> 00:53:45,626
-He will.
-No way!

829
00:53:45,692 --> 00:53:47,127
-Today!
-Impossible!

830
00:53:47,194 --> 00:53:48,061
-Right now!
-No...

831
00:53:56,503 --> 00:53:58,238
Take it and tie this
around her neck!

832
00:53:58,305 --> 00:53:59,406
You, idiot!

833
00:54:00,374 --> 00:54:01,909
They are putting up an act.

834
00:54:02,309 --> 00:54:04,845
One is a monster
and the other is a devil.

835
00:54:04,912 --> 00:54:06,880
They both are equally bad.

836
00:54:06,947 --> 00:54:09,149
Shut up! Or I'll smack your face!

837
00:54:09,216 --> 00:54:12,553
I'm telling you for your own good.
Let's go from here now.

838
00:54:12,619 --> 00:54:13,287
Hey!

839
00:54:14,354 --> 00:54:16,056
Don't you like me, Latthesha?

840
00:54:16,523 --> 00:54:18,292
Please try to understand me.

841
00:54:18,825 --> 00:54:23,063
I feel like you're all I have
in this entire world.

842
00:54:23,397 --> 00:54:24,531
You're my only friend.

843
00:54:25,732 --> 00:54:26,700
My best friend.

844
00:54:26,767 --> 00:54:29,436
Isn't this enough for you to marry me?

845
00:54:30,137 --> 00:54:31,805
Take it and marry me now!

846
00:54:33,707 --> 00:54:34,975
The moment,

847
00:54:35,042 --> 00:54:37,711
I saw pain in her eyes

848
00:54:39,546 --> 00:54:41,849
I got emotional

849
00:54:43,383 --> 00:54:46,153
and married her right away.

850
00:55:01,368 --> 00:55:02,336
You tied the knot!

851
00:55:04,771 --> 00:55:09,276
Let's see how long this will last.
You've my blessings till it does.

852
00:55:09,977 --> 00:55:10,744
Let's go.

853
00:55:18,352 --> 00:55:20,454
I've dreamt a lot about things
in life,

854
00:55:20,888 --> 00:55:22,556
but never ever imagined this...

855
00:55:25,626 --> 00:55:26,727
Thanks.

856
00:55:26,793 --> 00:55:31,865
Never imagined I would marry
someone right in the middle of the street.

857
00:55:36,236 --> 00:55:37,804
One more thing, ma'am

858
00:55:38,238 --> 00:55:42,709
I'd spend my consummation night
the way I did.

859
00:55:43,977 --> 00:55:46,280
[radio tuning]

860
00:55:47,347 --> 00:55:48,348
Sorry.

861
00:55:57,057 --> 00:55:59,993
I forced you to marry me,

862
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:04,164
but I don't feel like I'm married.

863
00:56:04,731 --> 00:56:06,333
Do you feel the same, too?

864
00:56:07,067 --> 00:56:08,268
No, ma'am...

865
00:56:09,136 --> 00:56:10,204
Madam?

866
00:56:17,978 --> 00:56:19,713
[radio tuning]

867
00:56:22,115 --> 00:56:24,785
-I have a desire.
-What is it, ma'am?

868
00:56:55,916 --> 00:56:58,886
Somehow, I became a family man too.

869
00:57:00,187 --> 00:57:06,126
Now I can tell the whole world
that I married someone I love.

870
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:13,033
Along with the marriage

871
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:16,904
comes family and responsibilities.

872
00:57:19,206 --> 00:57:21,942
Your aspirations grow bigger

873
00:57:22,376 --> 00:57:25,279
and you want to move into a bigger house.

874
00:57:26,413 --> 00:57:27,147
But...

875
00:57:27,814 --> 00:57:33,487
a bigger house
doesn't guarantee happiness.

876
00:57:34,688 --> 00:57:37,958
To tell you the truth
about my family life.

877
00:57:38,659 --> 00:57:40,694
We aren't at all happy.

878
00:57:41,562 --> 00:57:45,399
But I still continue to dream, you see.

879
00:57:45,566 --> 00:57:47,501
I dream of having a big family.

880
00:57:48,402 --> 00:57:50,938
And there is no compromise
with that.

881
00:57:51,004 --> 00:57:51,972
What is it?

882
00:57:53,607 --> 00:57:55,209
-Come, bro.
-Why?

883
00:57:55,609 --> 00:57:56,977
-Stand over there.
-Leave me alone.

884
00:57:59,046 --> 00:58:01,114
I have a desire.

885
00:58:02,783 --> 00:58:04,618
We need to have a family
of our own in a true sense.

886
00:58:05,152 --> 00:58:06,253
I've come up with an idea.

887
00:58:07,621 --> 00:58:09,890
Come and sit over here.

888
00:58:09,957 --> 00:58:12,659
Your mom and dad
will sit over there.

889
00:58:13,727 --> 00:58:15,662
This seat is for you officer.

890
00:58:16,096 --> 00:58:19,099
This is Swapna ma'am,
the fat lady's seat.

891
00:58:19,566 --> 00:58:22,069
Bro, you will sit over here.
This will be your seat

892
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:27,474
I want to see you all sit together
and have a good meal.

893
00:58:28,108 --> 00:58:29,543
How does it sound?

894
00:58:32,045 --> 00:58:33,247
We two are the family.

895
00:58:34,314 --> 00:58:36,950
No room for any new members.

896
00:58:39,353 --> 00:58:41,288
We two are more than enough.

897
00:58:42,789 --> 00:58:45,058
The two most important people in my life,

898
00:58:45,459 --> 00:58:47,561
Valli and Kenda,

899
00:58:47,828 --> 00:58:52,833
but they don't see eye to eye at all.

900
00:58:57,237 --> 00:58:59,273
-Hey! What?
-I know it's you...

901
00:58:59,339 --> 00:59:02,543
I was sick and tired
of their never ending fights.

902
00:59:03,343 --> 00:59:06,813
And the person who was hurt
the most was me.

903
00:59:07,214 --> 00:59:08,682
Give it to me!

904
00:59:08,749 --> 00:59:11,952
Don't you dare enter my room.

905
00:59:12,019 --> 00:59:13,854
-What do you think of yourself?
-Hey!

906
00:59:13,954 --> 00:59:16,123
What you guys doing?
Have you lost your minds?

907
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:17,457
Stop creating a scene!

908
00:59:17,524 --> 00:59:19,459
Look, I won't say another word.

909
00:59:19,793 --> 00:59:21,528
He has taken my amulet.

910
00:59:21,828 --> 00:59:23,497
Tell him to give it back.

911
00:59:23,564 --> 00:59:26,099
Did you dream of me
stealing it or what?

912
00:59:26,166 --> 00:59:27,534
Why should I?

913
00:59:27,768 --> 00:59:29,269
There's only one thief
in this house, you!

914
00:59:29,336 --> 00:59:31,905
Bro, look, she's calling me a thief!

915
00:59:32,306 --> 00:59:35,142
You must've misplaced it somewhere.
Let's look for it.

916
00:59:36,410 --> 00:59:37,444
Please, calm down.

917
00:59:37,511 --> 00:59:40,214
Why would I misplace my own amulet?

918
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:41,715
I've looked for it everywhere.

919
00:59:41,782 --> 00:59:44,117
He stole it. Tell him to return it.

920
00:59:44,184 --> 00:59:45,319
-No, bro.
-Bro...

921
00:59:45,385 --> 00:59:47,688
Bro, in case if it's with you,

922
00:59:47,754 --> 00:59:49,423
-please give it back.
-Hey...

923
00:59:49,489 --> 00:59:50,958
Stop it!

924
00:59:51,024 --> 00:59:53,894
You know how important it is to me.
I swear, he has stolen it.

925
00:59:53,961 --> 00:59:55,229
-Tell him to give it back.
-Bro...

926
00:59:55,295 --> 00:59:57,164
Don't believe her.
Please don't believe her.

927
00:59:57,231 --> 00:59:59,600
She's a filthy, dirty bitch.

928
00:59:59,666 --> 01:00:00,834
She's an ogress.

929
01:00:00,901 --> 01:00:04,137
She is trying to destroy
our friendship.

930
01:00:04,505 --> 01:00:06,974
You know its importance, don't you?

931
01:00:07,407 --> 01:00:10,777
He stole it for sure.
Tell him to return it, please!

932
01:00:10,844 --> 01:00:12,513
-See...
-Please!

933
01:00:16,617 --> 01:00:18,452
[sobbing]

934
01:00:24,725 --> 01:00:25,726
Give your bag, bro.

935
01:00:28,462 --> 01:00:29,730
Give your bag, bro.

936
01:00:46,113 --> 01:00:47,481
Bro!

937
01:00:48,782 --> 01:00:49,583
Bro!

938
01:00:50,651 --> 01:00:52,753
Hold on. Where are you going?

939
01:00:54,755 --> 01:00:56,323
You haven't taken it, right?

940
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:04,164
Stay here.

941
01:01:04,231 --> 01:01:05,999
Stay right here. Don't leave.

942
01:01:06,066 --> 01:01:07,401
Stay right here, bro.

943
01:01:11,772 --> 01:01:12,806
Where was it?

944
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:14,641
Where did you find it?

945
01:01:14,708 --> 01:01:16,777
-It wasn't in the bag, right?
-It was on the floor.

946
01:01:16,844 --> 01:01:18,045
Must've fallen out of the bag.

947
01:01:18,111 --> 01:01:21,748
-Bro, wait!
-Let him leave for good.

948
01:01:22,683 --> 01:01:24,518
He's a rogue!

949
01:01:24,585 --> 01:01:25,686
Let him go!

950
01:01:27,387 --> 01:01:29,556
By the time I returned,

951
01:01:30,224 --> 01:01:31,191
my friend,

952
01:01:31,792 --> 01:01:36,196
of 25 years had gone too far.

953
01:01:39,733 --> 01:01:41,902
Without my knowledge,

954
01:01:42,135 --> 01:01:44,705
I had committed yet another mistake.

955
01:01:47,241 --> 01:01:48,775
Going by his story,

956
01:01:49,109 --> 01:01:51,478
I think his friend
must've done something out of envy.

957
01:01:51,545 --> 01:01:55,449
Perhaps, it was his wife who was envious.
Am I right, madam?

958
01:01:55,516 --> 01:01:58,318
Stop being biased.
Don't men make mistakes?

959
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:03,624
But women don't admit their mistakes.
Am I right, sir?

960
01:02:04,491 --> 01:02:05,959
Look, he's laughing at us

961
01:02:06,026 --> 01:02:09,563
for fighting over
someone else's story.

962
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:11,832
Bro, tell us what happened next.

963
01:02:12,866 --> 01:02:13,934
I made a mistake.

964
01:02:15,402 --> 01:02:18,772
But I still don't know
whose fault it was.

965
01:02:20,874 --> 01:02:22,309
I paid the price, anyway.

966
01:02:30,317 --> 01:02:32,619
This is neither a hostel
nor are you a warden

967
01:02:33,187 --> 01:02:35,289
to just cook timely meals
and serve them.

968
01:02:36,823 --> 01:02:38,892
I'll eat only if you feed me with love.

969
01:02:42,095 --> 01:02:44,831
I'm your wife.
Do you remember that?

970
01:02:44,898 --> 01:02:49,736
Oh... Are you? Are we
really married to each other?

971
01:02:50,571 --> 01:02:52,239
I don't know what's going on here.

972
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:54,741
I'm confused.

973
01:02:55,876 --> 01:02:57,277
Are we... lovers?

974
01:02:58,378 --> 01:03:00,714
Or friends? Am I your husband?

975
01:03:01,281 --> 01:03:03,584
Or am I just a cook?

976
01:03:04,985 --> 01:03:06,386
I really don't know.

977
01:03:07,788 --> 01:03:09,990
I'm done with everything.

978
01:03:10,691 --> 01:03:12,226
I can't take it anymore.

979
01:03:15,295 --> 01:03:17,331
I want a simple wife,

980
01:03:18,665 --> 01:03:19,900
a small family.

981
01:03:21,101 --> 01:03:21,935
That's it.

982
01:03:29,109 --> 01:03:29,977
Loneliness...

983
01:03:30,711 --> 01:03:32,112
A gruesome isolation.

984
01:03:34,348 --> 01:03:35,082
And then?

985
01:03:36,383 --> 01:03:37,150
Hey!

986
01:03:38,151 --> 01:03:40,220
You're not just my best friend...

987
01:03:45,092 --> 01:03:46,894
You're my lover!

988
01:03:50,163 --> 01:03:52,900
And my husband too!

989
01:03:56,737 --> 01:04:02,709
I saw myself in you

990
01:04:03,277 --> 01:04:09,216
You mesmerized me through your eyes

991
01:04:10,584 --> 01:04:15,889
I've become one with you

992
01:04:16,557 --> 01:04:22,095
We've united with each other in harmony

993
01:04:22,162 --> 01:04:27,568
A flower is blossoming inside

994
01:04:28,368 --> 01:04:33,774
Through the warmth we shared

995
01:04:34,775 --> 01:04:37,811
Can I reach you

996
01:04:37,878 --> 01:04:40,581
My sole destination
Through the mellow tunes of my emotions?

997
01:04:41,648 --> 01:04:47,654
I saw myself in you

998
01:04:47,788 --> 01:04:53,560
You mesmerized me through your eyes

999
01:04:53,994 --> 01:04:55,462
-Latthesha.
-Yeah.

1000
01:04:56,430 --> 01:04:59,399
I have one small desire.

1001
01:04:59,466 --> 01:05:00,400
Very small.

1002
01:05:01,502 --> 01:05:02,870
What?

1003
01:05:41,575 --> 01:05:47,481
Why feel shy? Are you not my companion?

1004
01:05:47,748 --> 01:05:53,387
Am I not your lover
Who fulfils all your desires

1005
01:06:04,198 --> 01:06:08,769
You're the anchor of my life, my dear...

1006
01:06:10,404 --> 01:06:12,606
I want you to churn
a bowl full of butter for me.

1007
01:06:14,107 --> 01:06:14,975
Right now.

1008
01:06:15,275 --> 01:06:16,143
-Now?
-Yes.

1009
01:06:17,211 --> 01:06:22,716
The haunting pains and memories
Of the yesteryears

1010
01:06:23,350 --> 01:06:28,789
I'll sing a song to fade them away

1011
01:06:28,856 --> 01:06:34,528
I shall become the rhythm
To this sweet song

1012

Madam, it's urgent! Labour pains.

[Valli straining]

1016
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:07,194
Not me.

1017
01:07:07,294 --> 01:07:08,795
There. In the ambulance.

1018
01:07:10,664 --> 01:07:12,833
-Nothing to worry.
-[straining]

and now asking me not to worry?

What are you staring at? Take me in!

You, rascal! Come here.

1023
01:07:25,312 --> 01:07:27,581
If you don't look after me
once the baby is born,

1024
01:07:27,648 --> 01:07:28,749
I'll kill you!

Where did you buy the saree from?

1029
01:07:45,732 --> 01:07:47,534
From Chickpet?

1030
01:07:47,768 --> 01:07:49,803
It's lovely. How much did you pay?

Who is here with Vedavalli? Are you deaf?

01:08:08,322 --> 01:08:13,694
I saw myself in you

1034

You mesmerized me through your eyes

1035

-Hold tightly or else you'll fall.
-Get lost!

1036

How many times do I have to tell you
to wear a helmet?

1037

[song playing over gramophone]

1039
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:09,650
Latthesha, why is the same song repeating?

The needle has gone blunt.

Until it's replaced,

1042
01:09:15,022 --> 01:09:16,690
you'll have to live
with that sound.

1043
01:09:18,091 --> 01:09:18,825
Appayya.

1044
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:22,696
Appayya had brought a message with him.

1045
01:09:24,364 --> 01:09:26,500
Despite knowing his tragic past,

1046
01:09:26,567 --> 01:09:28,902
you've made him an orphan again.

1047
01:09:33,774 --> 01:09:36,243
You could've stopped him from leaving.

1048
01:09:36,643 --> 01:09:39,613
Are you aware of his condition now?

1049
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:43,183
This is a gun to burst balloons,

1050
01:09:43,183 --> 01:09:46,920
they use this in carnivals.

1051
01:10:04,204 --> 01:10:04,872
Then?

1052
01:10:04,938 --> 01:10:06,573
I won't tolerate you

Stop!

Why are you running away?

1056

Where was this old man
all these years?

1057

-You just need an alibi

01:10:30,531 --> 01:10:32,199
Yes, I will bring him back.

1064
01:10:32,266 --> 01:10:34,968
Sure, go ahead, bring him.

1065
01:10:35,035 --> 01:10:36,336
Bring everyone home.

1066
01:10:36,403 --> 01:10:37,771
Bring that rogue

1067
01:10:37,838 --> 01:10:40,774
and also my father
who abandoned me.

1068
01:10:40,841 --> 01:10:43,977
And also that bitch who married
my father, my stepmother

1069
01:10:44,044 --> 01:10:45,612
bring her too.

1070
01:10:45,846 --> 01:10:47,848
Go. Go!

1071
01:10:48,148 --> 01:10:50,651
Shall I give you the address?
Tell me!

1072
01:10:51,852 --> 01:10:54,688
What transpired that night
triggered other events in my life.

1073
01:10:54,755 --> 01:10:55,956
Let me tell you the truth.

1074
01:10:56,890 --> 01:11:00,561
There are two orphans
in this house, not one.

1075
01:11:02,462 --> 01:11:03,764
I was born orphan

1076
01:11:04,631 --> 01:11:07,367
but you're an orphan too?
Did you know that?

1077
01:11:07,835 --> 01:11:09,903
And you are responsible for that.

1078
01:11:10,204 --> 01:11:11,772
Try to understand that!

1079
01:11:12,372 --> 01:11:13,473
I don't want you.

1080
01:11:13,540 --> 01:11:14,775
I'm scared.

1081
01:11:14,875 --> 01:11:16,109
Don't come close to me.

1082
01:11:16,176 --> 01:11:17,878
-[Valli grunting]
-Latthesha!

1083
01:11:18,779 --> 01:11:19,847
Look!

1084
01:11:24,852 --> 01:11:26,253
Who are you?

1085
01:11:27,321 --> 01:11:28,455
I'm Lalli.

1086
01:11:28,689 --> 01:11:29,790
Which Lalli?

1087
01:11:30,858 --> 01:11:32,826
Go wherever you want to.

1088
01:11:32,893 --> 01:11:34,461
But she will stay here!

1089
01:11:36,964 --> 01:11:37,698
Lalli?

1090
01:11:39,266 --> 01:11:41,034
You'll stay here
or come with me?

1091
01:11:42,236 --> 01:11:43,203
Speak up!

1092
01:11:46,006 --> 01:11:47,074
Get lost!

1093
01:11:49,009 --> 01:11:51,044
[grunting] I'm the tiger.

1094
01:11:52,012 --> 01:11:54,147
I don't want this tiger.

1095
01:11:55,382 --> 01:11:57,150
There are already two orphans at home.

1096
01:11:57,217 --> 01:11:57,985
[mobile ringing]

1097
01:11:58,051 --> 01:11:59,887
I don't want to see another one.

1098
01:12:01,021 --> 01:12:04,525
I don't need anyone.
I can stay alone. [screaming]

1099
01:12:05,425 --> 01:12:07,828
I will not let my daughter
turn into an orphan.

1100
01:12:07,895 --> 01:12:08,996
[Valli grunting]

1101
01:12:09,730 --> 01:12:10,564
Is she...

1102
01:12:11,164 --> 01:12:14,368
She is the person
I was telling you about.

1103
01:12:15,702 --> 01:12:19,139
The person I was waiting
to narrate this story to...

1104
01:12:19,473 --> 01:12:22,209
But do you know what actually happened?

1105
01:12:24,845 --> 01:12:27,614
It has injured
that part of the brain

1106
01:12:28,248 --> 01:12:32,085
which makes the patient
lose their memory completely.

1107
01:12:34,221 --> 01:12:35,856
[grunting]

1108
01:12:38,559 --> 01:12:40,194
This is very interesting.

1109
01:12:42,996 --> 01:12:44,064
What happened next?

1110
01:12:45,098 --> 01:12:47,234
Can you please tell the story?

1111
01:12:51,839 --> 01:12:52,940
Dear Mother,

1112
01:12:53,674 --> 01:12:55,475
I can now comprehend

1113
01:12:55,976 --> 01:12:58,045
how special this journey is

1114
01:12:58,378 --> 01:13:00,013
and how interesting it is.

1115
01:13:00,914 --> 01:13:02,482
Because of a small anger,

1116
01:13:02,549 --> 01:13:04,051
a small rage,

1117
01:13:04,251 --> 01:13:06,286
- and a misunderstanding...
-Where are you taking my child?

1118
01:13:06,353 --> 01:13:08,789
I can't begin to imagine
what sort of problems

1119
01:13:09,189 --> 01:13:14,261
it can cause between two lovers, Mother.

1120
01:13:15,929 --> 01:13:18,465
Because of the fight they had
that night

1121
01:13:18,899 --> 01:13:21,768
their lives were devastated, Mother.

1122
01:13:22,236 --> 01:13:23,837
[woman screaming]

1123
01:13:24,438 --> 01:13:29,109
Unhearing the calls...

1124
01:13:30,143 --> 01:13:32,880
-Someone is here. See!
-Do you know whose vehicle this is?

1125
01:13:33,313 --> 01:13:37,651
Unseeing the seen...

1126
01:13:37,718 --> 01:13:39,520
Take a good look at it.
Come with us.

1127
01:13:42,022 --> 01:13:47,961
Why this game of forgetfulness?

1128
01:13:50,797 --> 01:13:56,803
Do you want to see this lover fail?

1129
01:14:00,274 --> 01:14:06,280
Picture me through closed eyes

1130
01:14:11,285 --> 01:14:15,656
And as you visualize

1131
01:14:15,722 --> 01:14:20,727
Open your eyes and see me

1132
01:14:22,996 --> 01:14:26,300
Picture me through closed eyes...

1133
01:14:26,366 --> 01:14:27,601
My son.

1134
01:14:28,335 --> 01:14:31,405
We came out to close the church gate.

1135
01:14:32,306 --> 01:14:33,740
That's when we heard crashing sound.

1136
01:14:33,807 --> 01:14:35,809
And then we found her
lying on the ground.

1137
01:14:35,876 --> 01:14:41,315
And as you visualize,
Open your eyes and see me

1138
01:14:44,051 --> 01:14:46,420
You see this, right? In the MRI scan?

1139
01:14:47,087 --> 01:14:49,923
It was a severe brain injury.
We've removed the clot now.

1140
01:14:50,257 --> 01:14:52,025
Autobiographical amnesia.

1141
01:14:52,826 --> 01:14:53,560
Posterior.

1142
01:14:54,228 --> 01:14:56,930
The part of the brain
which has injured

1143
01:14:56,997 --> 01:15:01,168
makes the patient
lose their memory completely.

1144
01:15:18,352 --> 01:15:20,087
Our Father was a great cook too.

1145
01:15:21,355 --> 01:15:23,223
He used to cook well, you know.

1146
01:15:23,690 --> 01:15:26,059
He knew he'll be crucifixed
the next morning,

1147
01:15:26,126 --> 01:15:27,728
yet he cooked.

1148
01:15:28,695 --> 01:15:30,297
That is known as "The Last Supper."

1149
01:15:30,864 --> 01:15:32,399
I'll tell you a secret, child.

1150
01:15:32,466 --> 01:15:33,934
Cooking has the power

1151
01:15:34,034 --> 01:15:36,036
to face any obstacle.

1152
01:15:38,038 --> 01:15:43,544
Let the light fill up

1153
01:15:43,610 --> 01:15:47,848
The dark space

1154
01:15:49,816 --> 01:15:55,689
As the warmth fills in

1155
01:15:55,756 --> 01:15:59,226
Let a new flavour rise

1156
01:16:00,294 --> 01:16:05,098
As the sky lightens up

1157
01:16:05,165 --> 01:16:10,470
To dawn some support

1158
01:16:10,537 --> 01:16:16,543
And as we step forward

1159
01:16:16,610 --> 01:16:18,245
There is a need of hope...

1160
01:16:18,312 --> 01:16:20,414
Valli, wake up! Valli...

1161
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:22,349
-Wake up... Wake up, Valli.
-Hey, Lalli.

1162
01:16:22,416 --> 01:16:24,151
Leave me! Let me go!

1163
01:16:26,220 --> 01:16:27,888
Next time you cook,

1164
01:16:27,955 --> 01:16:29,857
use two new ingredients.

1165
01:16:29,923 --> 01:16:32,626
Love and faith.

1166
01:16:32,693 --> 01:16:38,599
Picture me through closed eyes

1167
01:16:44,304 --> 01:16:48,642
And as you visualize,

1168
01:16:48,709 --> 01:16:53,447
Open your eyes and see me

1169
01:17:00,721 --> 01:17:01,955
Hey, Latthesha!

1170
01:17:02,022 --> 01:17:03,423
Look there! Look!

1171
01:17:24,611 --> 01:17:25,946
Veda, control!

1172
01:17:26,013 --> 01:17:31,485
This game of hide and seek

1173
01:17:31,552 --> 01:17:36,557
Has left me perplexed

1174
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:45,766
This bird has forgotten

1175
01:17:45,832 --> 01:17:51,138
Its way to its nest

1176
01:17:54,608 --> 01:17:55,776
Latthesh.

1177
01:17:57,444 --> 01:17:58,111
It's okay.

1178
01:18:00,113 --> 01:18:01,715
There is a treatment for everything.

1179
01:18:02,115 --> 01:18:03,183
In cases like these,

1180
01:18:03,517 --> 01:18:06,019
each and everything
related to the patient,

1181
01:18:06,854 --> 01:18:09,356
people, situations,

1182
01:18:09,957 --> 01:18:13,260
I mean, every incident
that has occurred in their life.

1183
01:18:13,627 --> 01:18:16,330
Starting from the most recent ones

1184
01:18:16,396 --> 01:18:17,598
to the ones in the past,

1185
01:18:17,664 --> 01:18:19,800
you will have to recreate everything.

1186
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:21,969
And as you recreate everything,

1187
01:18:22,436 --> 01:18:26,807
when the most important event
of her life occurs again,

1188
01:18:27,774 --> 01:18:29,476
she will be able to recall everything.

1189
01:18:30,444 --> 01:18:31,845
-Really, sir?
-Of course.

1190
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:33,647
It is possible.

1191
01:18:34,248 --> 01:18:36,984
But, until then,

1192
01:18:37,351 --> 01:18:39,419
we've to continue doing our job.

1193
01:18:39,987 --> 01:18:41,555
You will require a lot of patience.

1194
01:18:41,922 --> 01:18:42,990
You know why?

1195
01:18:43,056 --> 01:18:46,226
Brain, which is the size
of two clenched fists,

1196
01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:47,561
is very powerful.

1197
01:18:48,662 --> 01:18:51,698
Appearance, taste, smell, touch...

1198
01:18:51,765 --> 01:18:54,401
And similar experiences such as

1199
01:18:54,468 --> 01:18:55,903
laughter, pain,

1200
01:18:55,969 --> 01:18:57,938
sorrow, resentment, happiness,

1201
01:18:58,839 --> 01:19:01,041
all these emotions combined,

1202
01:19:01,308 --> 01:19:04,144
occupy only 10% of the space in it.

1203
01:19:04,878 --> 01:19:07,147
But when it comes to the human psyche,

1204
01:19:07,214 --> 01:19:09,583
nothing is more trickier than it.

1205
01:19:13,086 --> 01:19:15,255
For example, a lamp and a switch,

1206
01:19:15,722 --> 01:19:18,225
both are in working condition
and there is electricity supply.

1207
01:19:18,425 --> 01:19:19,259
And yet,

1208
01:19:19,426 --> 01:19:21,728
when it's switched on,
the lamp doesn't light up.

1209
01:19:22,563 --> 01:19:24,898
The wiring between them is damaged.

1210
01:19:24,965 --> 01:19:27,835
The entire wiring
needs to be checked thoroughly,

1211
01:19:27,901 --> 01:19:28,902
and should be fixed.

1212
01:19:29,436 --> 01:19:30,938
And as you continue doing it,

1213
01:19:31,104 --> 01:19:32,973
the electricity would flow at some point

1214
01:19:33,841 --> 01:19:35,475
and the lamp will light up.

1215
01:19:36,109 --> 01:19:42,115
Picture me through closed eyes...

1216
01:19:42,182 --> 01:19:46,253
Hopefully, it benefits everyone.

1217
01:19:47,554 --> 01:19:48,589
Go on.

1218
01:19:48,655 --> 01:19:51,792
And as you visualize

1219
01:19:51,859 --> 01:19:55,596
Open your eyes and see me

1220
01:19:57,831 --> 01:19:59,199
Sir, is this a pharmacy?

1221
01:19:59,266 --> 01:20:05,105
Picture me through closed eyes...

1222
01:20:05,506 --> 01:20:06,673
He's here, sir.

1223
01:20:07,608 --> 01:20:08,876
Try coming as soon as possible.

1224
01:20:09,042 --> 01:20:10,310
Oh, is it?

1225
01:20:10,511 --> 01:20:11,912
Okay, we'll leave right away.

1226
01:20:11,979 --> 01:20:15,215
And as you visualize

1227
01:20:15,282 --> 01:20:20,687
Open your eyes and see me

1228
01:20:28,128 --> 01:20:31,965
Sir, we have just six days
to make everything fall in place.

1229
01:20:32,099 --> 01:20:35,402
If she doesn't get well,
I'll lose all I have.

1230
01:20:38,772 --> 01:20:42,442
I hope she recalls everything.

1231
01:20:43,043 --> 01:20:44,444
This is my prayer.

1232
01:20:51,985 --> 01:20:53,854
Bro, who is this girl?

1233
01:20:54,288 --> 01:20:55,189
Your wife?

1234
01:20:55,656 --> 01:20:57,291
She's a cracker.

1235
01:20:57,791 --> 01:21:02,262
Sir, I suggest you start
advertising mirrors from tomorrow.

1236
01:21:02,329 --> 01:21:06,633
All men will bow before you
for saving their money on cosmetics.

1237
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:08,769
But keep away from women.

1238
01:21:11,338 --> 01:21:12,706
Stop blabbering, will you?

1239
01:21:12,773 --> 01:21:17,578
You got to be careful with women.
They aren't trustworthy.

1240
01:21:17,644 --> 01:21:21,248
They might even ask you to carry
the mirror for them.

1241
01:21:21,315 --> 01:21:23,183
-Hey, Latthesh... Come here, quick.
-What happened, sir?

1242
01:21:24,718 --> 01:21:26,720
She's already there.
Something might happen.

1243
01:21:26,787 --> 01:21:28,355
Bro, what do I do with this mirror?

1244
01:21:28,889 --> 01:21:29,957
Leave it there.

1245
01:21:31,758 --> 01:21:32,860
Look, I told you.

1246
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:34,828
She has opened the trunk.

1247
01:21:34,895 --> 01:21:37,164
That means she remembers the number.

1248
01:21:43,170 --> 01:21:45,305
Shh. Hey, get down.

1249
01:21:47,074 --> 01:21:48,775
Do you remember what that is?

1250
01:21:51,178 --> 01:21:51,945
Come.

1251
01:21:59,019 --> 01:22:00,888
Do you know what it is?
Can you try?

1252
01:22:01,188 --> 01:22:04,157
How old is it? Who owns it?
Where was it bought?

1253
01:22:07,261 --> 01:22:10,297
Well, how about these two?

1254
01:22:11,231 --> 01:22:14,134
-Do you remember--
-Don't touch anything in the trunk.

1255
01:22:14,468 --> 01:22:16,703
Don't lock it. Just a minute...

1256
01:22:28,715 --> 01:22:31,151
This trunk is as complex
as her mind, Latthesh.

1257
01:22:31,652 --> 01:22:33,587
It's secured by a number lock.

1258
01:22:34,388 --> 01:22:37,524
We have to open this trunk
to understand her complexes.

1259
01:22:37,591 --> 01:22:41,228
Don't you worry.
I'll cut it open with a blade.

1260
01:22:41,295 --> 01:22:43,797
I'll cut your head open.
Is that okay?

1261
01:22:45,265 --> 01:22:47,034
Somehow, we've to open this trunk.

1262
01:22:47,534 --> 01:22:48,569
Can you open it?

1263
01:22:50,671 --> 01:22:53,740
It's been at home for seven years,
but I've no clue how to.

1264
01:22:57,644 --> 01:23:02,049
How many secrets
can a person's mind hold, Mother?

1265
01:23:06,787 --> 01:23:08,822
Can a simple number

1266
01:23:08,889 --> 01:23:12,726
shed light on all her mysteries?

1267
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:14,928
What's that number?

1268
01:23:15,996 --> 01:23:17,130
Come on. Come on.

1269
01:23:22,336 --> 01:23:23,704
Oh, good Lord!

1270
01:23:25,706 --> 01:23:26,773
Open! Come on!

1271
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:27,875
You're going to break it!

1272
01:23:28,442 --> 01:23:30,210
That's the only way to open it.

1273
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:33,313
Zero to nine,
four digit number,

1274
01:23:33,413 --> 01:23:35,816
and 10,000 combinations.

1275
01:23:36,316 --> 01:23:37,284
If we keep trying like this,

1276
01:23:37,417 --> 01:23:40,020
it might take a day or even ten years.

1277
01:23:40,087 --> 01:23:41,955
But we have only six days on hand.
Make way!

1278
01:23:43,257 --> 01:23:45,726
What is the mystery number?

1279
01:23:46,260 --> 01:23:47,928
I don't know.

1280
01:23:48,128 --> 01:23:49,897
But what I really appreciate is,

1281
01:23:50,063 --> 01:23:53,066
their sincere and whole-hearted effort

1282
01:23:53,267 --> 01:23:56,236
to bring back Veda's memory.

1283
01:23:57,037 --> 01:23:59,640
For example, Dr. Francis... [sighs]

1284
01:23:59,706 --> 01:24:01,108
A very strange person, Mother.

1285
01:24:01,175 --> 01:24:02,676
In principle,

1286
01:24:02,776 --> 01:24:05,612
he is Veda's psychiatrist.

1287
01:24:05,679 --> 01:24:07,614
But in a way, he himself is a patient.

1288
01:24:07,681 --> 01:24:10,417
He has a peculiar disorder called OCD.

1289
01:24:10,484 --> 01:24:13,387
I think it comes with being a doctor.

1290
01:24:13,453 --> 01:24:17,191
He's also Swapna's fiance.

1291
01:24:17,257 --> 01:24:20,494
So to fulfil his duties
and to impress his fiance,

1292
01:24:20,561 --> 01:24:24,364
he is using all his intellect
and giving more than hundred percent.

1293
01:24:24,431 --> 01:24:25,232
But...

1294
01:24:25,332 --> 01:24:30,137
Nothing happened for eight months.
Will it happen in the next six days?

1295
01:24:31,104 --> 01:24:32,906
If we continue our efforts,

1296
01:24:34,007 --> 01:24:36,944
it's a medical probability
that her memory would come back.

1297
01:24:37,010 --> 01:24:40,581
But putting in efforts
to make it happen in about six days,

1298
01:24:40,647 --> 01:24:43,450
hoping for a medical miracle?

1299
01:24:43,517 --> 01:24:44,184
A wonder!

1300
01:24:45,152 --> 01:24:47,921
All their happiness depends
on a miracle

1301
01:24:47,988 --> 01:24:51,258
that needs to occur in the next six days.

1302
01:24:52,125 --> 01:24:55,429
In the hope of this miracle,

1303
01:24:55,495 --> 01:24:58,432
everyone is waging a war
against time and memory.

1304
01:24:58,498 --> 01:25:00,234
Valli, don't you know me?

1305
01:25:01,268 --> 01:25:04,805
And me, I'm a guest after all,

1306
01:25:05,038 --> 01:25:08,442
still, in what way
can I be of help to them?

1307
01:25:41,975 --> 01:25:44,211
If you use these ingredients,

1308
01:25:44,278 --> 01:25:46,713
she would perhaps recall your cooking.

1309
01:25:51,852 --> 01:25:52,819
All the best.

1310
01:25:59,793 --> 01:26:01,295
A personal suggestion to you,

1311
01:26:02,095 --> 01:26:03,063
if you don't mind.

1312
01:26:03,130 --> 01:26:04,064
Tell me, ma'am.

1313
01:26:05,499 --> 01:26:10,137
I think your love is hidden
behind your facial hair

1314
01:26:10,204 --> 01:26:12,039
that's why she's unable
to spot it.

1315
01:26:15,008 --> 01:26:19,446
Until she gets back her memory,
I can't break the vow.

1316
01:26:23,851 --> 01:26:24,551
Okay.

1317
01:26:33,627 --> 01:26:36,597
Salt, sour, sweet, bitter,
pungent, and astringent.

1318
01:26:36,663 --> 01:26:38,098
All the six tastes are in this.

1319
01:26:38,165 --> 01:26:40,467
Anyone can cook using these.

1320
01:26:41,168 --> 01:26:44,705
But you have a special ingredient with you.

1321
01:26:45,439 --> 01:26:46,773
That is love.

1322
01:26:47,608 --> 01:26:50,377
I looked for it everywhere
but couldn't find it.

1323
01:26:50,644 --> 01:26:53,247
There's love in you in abundance.

1324
01:26:53,547 --> 01:26:55,249
Don't lose it.

1325
01:26:57,885 --> 01:26:58,785
Hey!

1326
01:27:13,066 --> 01:27:13,901
Madam?

1327
01:27:14,568 --> 01:27:15,335
Valli madam?

1328
01:27:17,037 --> 01:27:18,972
Try to recall. Look at it, madam.

1329
01:27:21,642 --> 01:27:22,476
Madam...

1330
01:27:22,543 --> 01:27:23,343
Have it, madam.

1331
01:27:38,725 --> 01:27:43,530
What a tragedy, Mother!

1332
01:27:43,597 --> 01:27:47,267
That fateful moment
when Valli asked Latthesha

1333
01:27:47,334 --> 01:27:51,138
to rename himself
as Bheemasena Nalamaharaja...

1334
01:27:52,306 --> 01:27:53,907
Must have been an inauspicious moment

1335
01:27:53,974 --> 01:27:57,311
when Latthesha planned
to fulfil Veda's wish...

1336
01:27:58,412 --> 01:27:59,980
[gunshot]

1337
01:28:02,049 --> 01:28:03,283
Shakuni and Shani,

1338
01:28:03,350 --> 01:28:05,018
the villains in the lives
of Bheema and Nala,

1339
01:28:05,085 --> 01:28:09,356
both have taken a rebirth in the form
of Kenda to trouble them.

1340
01:28:09,523 --> 01:28:12,759
So you have come here to heal her, is it?

1341
01:28:12,926 --> 01:28:15,729
Pull her by the hair,

1342
01:28:15,896 --> 01:28:21,268
slap her, and then ask her.

1343
01:28:21,335 --> 01:28:25,239
Tell her to stop the farce.

1344
01:28:25,305 --> 01:28:26,773
[slurs]

1345
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:35,382
When everyone was trying their best
to bring back Veda's memory...

1346
01:28:36,517 --> 01:28:38,919
this villain, Kenda...

1347
01:28:42,556 --> 01:28:45,893
Bro, no! No! Listen to me!

1348
01:28:45,959 --> 01:28:48,195
...lit fire to the projection curtain.

1349
01:28:52,165 --> 01:28:55,636
He's posing a serious threat
to derail all the efforts...

1350
01:28:56,003 --> 01:28:58,605
There are only five days left!

1351
01:28:59,006 --> 01:29:01,542
Will Veda be able to recall by then?

1352
01:29:03,010 --> 01:29:06,547
She is fooling you all with her theatrics.

1353
01:29:15,222 --> 01:29:18,058
Latthesha, will Valli talk?

1354
01:29:24,231 --> 01:29:25,132
Promise?

1355
01:29:26,166 --> 01:29:30,537
Are you fading away from me

1356
01:29:31,138 --> 01:29:33,640
Come to me like a shadow

1357
01:29:35,843 --> 01:29:40,113
Are you running away from talking to me?

1358
01:29:40,614 --> 01:29:43,884
Come back as our pail of laughter...

1359
01:29:44,084 --> 01:29:46,486
It's been so long
since we got back from the hospital.

1360
01:29:46,553 --> 01:29:48,021
And she still hasn't spoken.

1361
01:29:48,088 --> 01:29:50,924
Why is she not talking?
When will she talk again?

1362
01:29:54,895 --> 01:29:59,766
I'm craving to embrace you

1363
01:29:59,833 --> 01:30:01,869
But I feel numb...

1364
01:30:01,935 --> 01:30:03,804
Look at this calendar.

1365
01:30:04,404 --> 01:30:07,941
As the days pass,
your mom will remember everything.

1366
01:30:08,842 --> 01:30:10,410
When will she recall?

1367
01:30:10,477 --> 01:30:12,880
When will she talk to us?

1368
01:30:20,687 --> 01:30:21,788
On your birthday.

1369
01:30:22,589 --> 01:30:23,557
Promise?

1370
01:30:24,591 --> 01:30:29,263
Come back as thyself

1371
01:30:29,329 --> 01:30:31,899
As a mother

1372
01:30:34,168 --> 01:30:38,605
Are you fading away from me?

1373
01:30:38,972 --> 01:30:41,942
Come to me like a shadow

1374
01:30:44,478 --> 01:30:46,046
Valli has a tape record player.

1375
01:30:46,914 --> 01:30:49,116
-Will you bring it?
-Why should I get it?

1376
01:30:57,558 --> 01:31:02,262
Because it will help
your mom regain her memory.

1377
01:31:09,403 --> 01:31:10,637
What if she hits me?

1378
01:31:10,704 --> 01:31:12,773
-She won't.
-Promise?

1379
01:31:16,844 --> 01:31:17,811
God...

1380
01:31:24,318 --> 01:31:25,219
Lalli...

1381
01:31:25,285 --> 01:31:27,855
Look, Lalli, you want to shop
for your birthday or not?

1382
01:31:27,921 --> 01:31:28,956
Come, let's go.

1383
01:31:29,022 --> 01:31:30,891
If you don't come, I'll go alone.

1384
01:31:31,558 --> 01:31:34,328
She'll go without you. Come.

1385
01:31:34,394 --> 01:31:36,063
Will you go shopping with me?

1386
01:31:36,296 --> 01:31:37,264
Okay, dear?

1387
01:31:44,771 --> 01:31:45,606
Let's go?

1388
01:31:47,307 --> 01:31:48,008
Come.

1389
01:31:48,075 --> 01:31:49,743
As I wait for the warmth...

1390
01:31:49,810 --> 01:31:52,179
We bought a new dress!

1391
01:31:52,246 --> 01:31:56,383
Of your love

1392
01:31:57,184 --> 01:32:01,688
The need for closed doors

1393
01:32:01,755 --> 01:32:04,725
Has elapsed

1394
01:32:06,426 --> 01:32:09,229
Sir... Sir... No need to pierce.
Please stop.

1395
01:32:09,296 --> 01:32:14,101
-It must be paining a lot.
-No, it's not paining.

1396
01:32:14,168 --> 01:32:15,936
[crying]

1397
01:32:17,104 --> 01:32:20,541
I don't have any pain. Promise

1398
01:32:21,008 --> 01:32:25,879
Come back as thyself

1399
01:32:25,946 --> 01:32:28,682
As a mother...

1400
01:32:28,815 --> 01:32:30,484
You are looking like an angel.

1401
01:32:31,385 --> 01:32:33,353
Lalli, your birthday dress is very cute.

1402
01:32:33,420 --> 01:32:35,222
Since I'm wearing my birthday dress,

1403
01:32:35,289 --> 01:32:37,224
shall we celebrate
my birthday today itself?

1404
01:32:37,391 --> 01:32:39,092
Yes, of course we could...

1405
01:32:39,726 --> 01:32:42,763
But shouldn't we wait
for your mom to get well?

1406
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:49,136
What else do you want, dear?

1407
01:32:52,706 --> 01:32:54,641
How many times have I told you
to fix that lamp?

1408
01:32:54,708 --> 01:32:58,512
-Do it right away!
-Why do you require a lamp during the day?

1409
01:32:58,745 --> 01:33:02,482
It's a bad omen.
Fix it right away.

1410
01:33:02,549 --> 01:33:04,918
I think your head
needs a bit of fixing too.

1411
01:33:04,985 --> 01:33:07,588
Till then nothing else will work properly.
-What do you mean?

1412
01:33:07,654 --> 01:33:09,256
-You are a nutcase...
-Shut up.

1413
01:33:09,523 --> 01:33:12,392
Is that the way to talk to him?

1414
01:33:13,060 --> 01:33:14,328
I'll fix it tonight.

1415
01:33:15,796 --> 01:33:18,999
If he has told you
to fix it, then do it.

1416
01:33:19,066 --> 01:33:20,701
Latthesh, come, we've work to do.

1417
01:33:20,767 --> 01:33:22,369
-Do it now!
-You do it.

1418
01:33:22,469 --> 01:33:24,004
You come with me... Come.

1419
01:33:25,272 --> 01:33:26,473
Damn, you all.

1420
01:33:26,607 --> 01:33:30,344
The only sane person
in the resort has gone mad today.

1421
01:33:31,178 --> 01:33:35,849
Hey, will their treatment work?

1422
01:33:37,251 --> 01:33:38,785
No way!

1423
01:33:40,287 --> 01:33:42,523
What are they going to do now?

1424
01:33:43,156 --> 01:33:46,527
I'm least bothered.
I don't care.

1425
01:33:46,593 --> 01:33:48,862
I'm going home tonight.

1426
01:33:48,929 --> 01:33:50,831
I don't want to do anything
with you or them.

1427
01:33:50,898 --> 01:33:53,567
The doctor and the patient,
both are crazy,

1428
01:33:53,634 --> 01:33:56,203
I'll go mad if I get involved...

1429
01:33:57,871 --> 01:33:59,339
[hissing]

1430
01:34:21,094 --> 01:34:21,895
Careful.

1431
01:34:22,729 --> 01:34:23,564
What?

1432
01:34:25,566 --> 01:34:26,366
Good girl.

1433
01:34:26,433 --> 01:34:27,501
What do you want?

1434
01:34:30,637 --> 01:34:31,605
Here...

1435
01:34:33,841 --> 01:34:36,743
There are two doctors, you know?

1436
01:34:37,110 --> 01:34:37,878
Who?

1437
01:34:38,378 --> 01:34:41,982
Since they're in different
kind of clothing,

1438
01:34:42,749 --> 01:34:45,652
you couldn't figure out he was a doctor.

1439
01:34:45,719 --> 01:34:47,955
So tell me who it is.

1440
01:34:48,021 --> 01:34:49,389
You guess, let's see.

1441
01:34:49,857 --> 01:34:50,757
White and white?

1442
01:34:51,925 --> 01:34:52,759
Fatty?

1443
01:34:56,196 --> 01:34:57,731
[indistinct]

1444
01:35:00,267 --> 01:35:02,269
Then, is it you?

1445
01:35:08,175 --> 01:35:10,511
I've a tonic with me.

1446
01:35:11,044 --> 01:35:12,513
If one drinks it...

1447
01:35:14,581 --> 01:35:16,950
they'll be able to recall everything.

1448
01:35:17,084 --> 01:35:18,519
This is the one.

1449
01:35:19,653 --> 01:35:20,420
Damn.

1450
01:35:22,589 --> 01:35:24,691
It's bone dry.

1451
01:35:26,260 --> 01:35:28,829
The tonic that'll remind
your mom everything...

1452
01:35:29,863 --> 01:35:30,764
Will you bring it?

1453
01:35:31,532 --> 01:35:33,267
[thunder rumbling]

1454
01:35:50,417 --> 01:35:51,518
Who gave this to you?

1455
01:35:51,585 --> 01:35:53,587
An uncle gave it to me.

1456
01:35:54,154 --> 01:35:55,956
You won't get this here. Go.

1457
01:35:56,390 --> 01:35:58,225
Give that bottle to me.

1458
01:35:58,859 --> 01:36:00,928
Girl... That isn't medicine.
Give it to me...

1459
01:36:01,562 --> 01:36:03,163
Hold on. Give it to me.

1460
01:36:03,230 --> 01:36:04,765
-Where are you off to?
-To the next store.

1461
01:36:04,831 --> 01:36:07,568
Oh, God, now they employ kids
to get alcohol!?

1462
01:36:31,925 --> 01:36:34,027
[screaming]

1463
01:36:34,928 --> 01:36:35,796
Lalli?

1464
01:36:37,497 --> 01:36:38,732
Lalli?

1465
01:36:42,503 --> 01:36:43,570
Lalli?

1466
01:36:46,073 --> 01:36:47,241
Lalli!

1467
01:36:55,649 --> 01:36:56,683
Lalli!

1468
01:36:58,919 --> 01:36:59,953
Lalli!

1469
01:37:11,632 --> 01:37:12,766
[shushing]

1470
01:37:13,467 --> 01:37:15,302
Stay quiet.

1471
01:37:16,270 --> 01:37:18,372
Why are you following me?

1472
01:37:18,438 --> 01:37:19,740
Why have you come here?

1473
01:37:19,806 --> 01:37:21,842
I need to buy a medicine.

1474
01:37:22,109 --> 01:37:23,277
Medicine?

1475
01:37:24,011 --> 01:37:26,513
I know where to find it. Come

1476
01:37:27,514 --> 01:37:29,249
I'll get the medicine for you. Come.

1477
01:37:30,417 --> 01:37:31,451
Come.

1478
01:37:31,919 --> 01:37:32,653
Come on.

1479
01:37:33,887 --> 01:37:34,955
You stay here.

1480
01:37:35,589 --> 01:37:37,491
I going inside and bringing medicine.

1481
01:37:37,558 --> 01:37:39,359
No, I want to come.

1482
01:37:39,993 --> 01:37:41,061
In there?

1483
01:37:42,729 --> 01:37:45,365
There are doctors with injections inside.

1484
01:37:45,432 --> 01:37:47,034
Do you want a shot?

1485
01:37:47,734 --> 01:37:48,468
No.

1486
01:37:49,236 --> 01:37:50,604
Then sit right here.

1487
01:37:51,171 --> 01:37:54,074
-I'll go in and get it, okay?
-Okay.

1488
01:37:59,112 --> 01:38:00,247
-Is she awake?
-No.

1489
01:38:00,647 --> 01:38:02,249
-Did she find out?
-No, no.

1490
01:38:02,983 --> 01:38:04,484
I don't want her to panic.

1491
01:38:04,551 --> 01:38:05,786
Oh, Latthesha...

1492
01:38:05,853 --> 01:38:06,653
Latthesha...

1493
01:38:07,955 --> 01:38:09,423
Latthesh, relax.

1494
01:38:10,724 --> 01:38:13,694
I'm sure she's somewhere around.

1495
01:38:15,128 --> 01:38:16,663
When did you last see her?

1496
01:38:16,897 --> 01:38:18,265
I haven't seen her all day.

1497
01:38:18,799 --> 01:38:20,000
All day?

1498
01:38:22,736 --> 01:38:23,403
Sir,

1499
01:38:23,871 --> 01:38:25,405
she's never done this before.

1500
01:38:27,140 --> 01:38:29,276
Hey, girl, here's the medicine.

1501
01:38:30,143 --> 01:38:33,380
This will cure everything.

1502
01:38:34,181 --> 01:38:35,749
-Okay. Go.
-What about you?

1503
01:38:36,183 --> 01:38:38,685
There are a lot of patients inside.

1504
01:38:39,119 --> 01:38:42,189
I'll come later,
once I have treated all the patients.

1505
01:38:42,256 --> 01:38:43,891
Okay, you go.

1506
01:38:44,791 --> 01:38:46,326
Alright, you leave.

1507
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:49,096
-Okay, bye, uncle. Thank you.
-Okay, bye.

1508
01:38:49,196 --> 01:38:51,732
Good night. Thank you. Happy birthday.

1509
01:38:51,798 --> 01:38:53,233
-No mention. Bye.
-Bye.

1510
01:38:56,336 --> 01:38:58,972
Latthesha, take this medicine
and give it to Valli.

1511
01:38:59,973 --> 01:39:02,176
Where did you go? Where were you?

1512
01:39:02,609 --> 01:39:04,111
Like your mother's shenanigans
aren't enough,

1513
01:39:04,678 --> 01:39:05,812
you've also started.

1514
01:39:06,980 --> 01:39:08,315
Where did you go
without my permission!

1515
01:39:08,382 --> 01:39:10,350
-You lie to me all the time.
- About what?

1516
01:39:10,417 --> 01:39:14,388
You told me this white-and-white
will cure Valli,

1517
01:39:14,454 --> 01:39:16,857
but why didn't you mention
about the other doctor?

1518
01:39:18,792 --> 01:39:19,459
Who?

1519
01:39:21,795 --> 01:39:23,230
Take it. This is the medicine.

1520
01:39:30,204 --> 01:39:32,739
-Did you give it, doctor?
-No, no, no...

1521
01:39:32,806 --> 01:39:34,374
Not him.

1522
01:39:35,442 --> 01:39:36,677
Ah... Him.

1523
01:39:39,947 --> 01:39:43,517
Until Valli speaks with me,

1524
01:39:43,750 --> 01:39:46,186
I won't talk to anyone.

1525
01:39:54,995 --> 01:39:56,396
Hey... Latthesha...

1526
01:39:57,631 --> 01:39:59,366
Latthesh, what are you doing?

1527
01:39:59,433 --> 01:40:00,634
Easy, easy...

1528
01:40:02,503 --> 01:40:03,437
I was humiliated,

1529
01:40:05,005 --> 01:40:05,806
I was hurt,

1530
01:40:07,441 --> 01:40:09,743
but I never, ever talked about it.

1531
01:40:13,180 --> 01:40:16,650
I'm enduring it as a punishment
for what I did that night.

1532
01:40:19,253 --> 01:40:21,421
My daughter has nothing to do with it.

1533
01:40:22,389 --> 01:40:23,891
Latthesh, stop.

1534
01:40:23,957 --> 01:40:24,892
You...

1535
01:40:25,692 --> 01:40:27,728
If you dare mess with her again...

1536
01:40:29,129 --> 01:40:31,365
I won't hesitate to kill you.

1537
01:40:41,141 --> 01:40:42,643
I'm done doing your chores.

1538
01:40:43,810 --> 01:40:47,648
Get somebody else to do it.

1539
01:40:48,482 --> 01:40:49,616
Stay away from my daughter.

1540
01:40:50,484 --> 01:40:52,986
I don't care even if my wife
doesn't recover

1541
01:40:55,355 --> 01:40:56,190
but I want you out of here.

1542
01:40:59,459 --> 01:41:00,861
Thanks for all the help.

1543
01:41:02,462 --> 01:41:04,097
Don't turn me into a murderer.

1544
01:41:21,181 --> 01:41:21,949
Latthesh...

1545
01:41:22,015 --> 01:41:24,718
How insensitive...

1546
01:41:25,586 --> 01:41:28,021
There's no tinge of remorse in him.

1547
01:41:32,759 --> 01:41:33,627
And then, there's Lalli.

1548
01:41:34,061 --> 01:41:36,430
She's too young
to understand the situation.

1549
01:41:37,231 --> 01:41:39,466
But she's still trying to do anything

1550
01:41:39,533 --> 01:41:41,702
-to bring back Veda's memory.
-Lalli...

1551
01:41:41,768 --> 01:41:43,937
It's quite deep over there! Don't go!

1552
01:41:44,838 --> 01:41:47,441
Until Valli comes, I'll be in water...

1553
01:41:47,508 --> 01:41:50,043
Veda, please ask her to come back,

1554
01:41:50,110 --> 01:41:51,712
she'll listen to you!

1555
01:41:52,513 --> 01:41:53,480
Lalli, come back!

1556
01:41:53,547 --> 01:41:56,316
-Your mother is calling you.
-Lalli! Lalli!

1557
01:41:56,383 --> 01:41:59,486
Latthesh, go rescue her or she'll drown.

1558
01:41:59,553 --> 01:42:02,723
-Lalli! Lalli!
-I won't come back till Valli comes here.

1559
01:42:05,192 --> 01:42:07,194
Leave me! Leave me!

1560
01:42:07,261 --> 01:42:11,231
Managing them has become
a big challenge for Latthesh.

1561
01:42:13,267 --> 01:42:17,004
Why did you go there?
Do you think she cares if you drown?

1562
01:42:21,642 --> 01:42:24,011
I neither feel pain nor I'm scared!

1563
01:42:26,547 --> 01:42:31,251
Poor Latthesh,
his condition's very miserable.

1564
01:42:35,255 --> 01:42:37,824
Although Veda is witnessing everything,

1565
01:42:37,891 --> 01:42:39,760
she is unable to recall a thing.

1566
01:42:41,762 --> 01:42:43,497
How can a mother

1567
01:42:43,564 --> 01:42:47,267
forget her own... own daughter?

1568
01:42:49,436 --> 01:42:51,305
What kind of a sick
disorder is this, Mother?

1569
01:42:52,639 --> 01:42:54,741
With each passing day,

1570
01:42:54,808 --> 01:42:58,145
the hope of miracle is fading away.

1571
01:43:00,614 --> 01:43:06,186
I'm apprehensive that
this family might break into pieces.

1572
01:43:07,955 --> 01:43:09,656
[screaming]

1573
01:43:18,365 --> 01:43:19,933
There is a treatment for everything.

1574
01:43:21,802 --> 01:43:24,538
In cases like this,
everything has to be recreated.

1575
01:43:24,605 --> 01:43:28,609
It could be a happy situation
or even a miserable incident.

1576
01:43:28,675 --> 01:43:32,279
Her mother drowned when she was a kid.

1577
01:43:37,885 --> 01:43:38,886
Give me the kid's boat.

1578
01:43:38,952 --> 01:43:41,555
I want my boat right away!

1579
01:43:41,622 --> 01:43:44,725
When the most important incident
of her life occurs again,

1580
01:43:44,791 --> 01:43:46,927
she will recall everything.

1581
01:43:48,161 --> 01:43:49,196
Forward!

1582
01:43:50,497 --> 01:43:51,732
Forward!

1583
01:43:52,399 --> 01:43:53,433
Forward!

1584
01:44:03,677 --> 01:44:04,978
[Valli groans]

1585
01:44:06,346 --> 01:44:08,448
[Valli straining]

1586
01:44:25,465 --> 01:44:26,667
One...

1587
01:44:28,168 --> 01:44:29,236
Two...

1588
01:44:30,571 --> 01:44:31,872
Here it comes.

1589
01:44:31,939 --> 01:44:34,174
-Here it comes. Here it comes...
-Leave me.

1590
01:44:45,219 --> 01:44:46,386
Veda!

1591
01:44:48,055 --> 01:44:48,856
[indistinct]

1592
01:45:02,402 --> 01:45:06,773

[footsteps approaching]

1595
01:45:51,885 --> 01:45:53,153
[screaming]

1596
01:45:54,488 --> 01:45:57,191
Hitler! Hitler! Hitler!

1597
01:45:57,524 --> 01:45:59,560
Hitler! Hitler!

1598
01:45:59,626 --> 01:46:00,561
Hitler!

1599
01:46:01,295 --> 01:46:03,530
[panting]

1600
01:46:04,298 --> 01:46:05,399
Hitler.

1601
01:46:08,101 --> 01:46:12,573
When the most important incident
of her life occurs again,

1602
01:46:13,707 --> 01:46:14,942
she'll recall everything.

1603
01:46:18,745 --> 01:46:19,580
Are you angry?

1604
01:46:21,682 --> 01:46:23,050
Are you angry?

1605
01:46:23,217 --> 01:46:24,518
Oh, you're angry?

1606
01:46:25,052 --> 01:46:26,486
Are you angry?

1607
01:46:26,553 --> 01:46:28,455
If you're not angry, give me a kiss?

1608
01:46:31,258 --> 01:46:31,992
Leave me!

1609
01:46:32,226 --> 01:46:34,228
Sir, should I go?

1610
01:46:34,494 --> 01:46:35,329
Should I answer that?

1611
01:46:36,296 --> 01:46:39,800
Sir, how can I leave her
in such a condition?

1612
01:46:41,735 --> 01:46:43,937
That's not the reason
for you to not go.

1613
01:46:45,439 --> 01:46:48,609
Don't let your ego take control
in such situations.

1614
01:46:50,043 --> 01:46:50,811
Come on now.

1615
01:46:52,746 --> 01:46:56,416
-Don't wander here and there.
-I know.

1616
01:46:56,483 --> 01:46:58,952
Come to me as a shadow

1617
01:46:59,019 --> 01:47:01,188
Come back as our pail of laughter

1618
01:47:01,255 --> 01:47:05,392
Come back as a reason or even as pain...

1619
01:47:05,826 --> 01:47:08,128
Okay, Sarah,
Lalli is your responsibility now.

1620
01:47:08,495 --> 01:47:13,233
When a person is fighting for his family,
we've to wholeheartedly support him.

1621
01:47:13,433 --> 01:47:15,469
Come back as thyself

1622
01:47:15,536 --> 01:47:18,005
Come to me as a shadow

1623
01:47:18,071 --> 01:47:20,340
Come back as our pail of laughter

1624
01:47:20,674 --> 01:47:25,279
Come back as a reason or even as pain

1625
01:47:25,345 --> 01:47:27,781
Come back with the same memories

1626
01:47:27,848 --> 01:47:30,017
Come back for me

1627
01:47:30,083 --> 01:47:32,586
Come back as a baby

1628
01:47:32,653 --> 01:47:34,955
Come back as thyself

1629
01:47:40,594 --> 01:47:43,363
-Is the order ready?
-Madam is taking care of it.

1630
01:47:43,430 --> 01:47:44,264
Sir...

1631
01:47:45,732 --> 01:47:47,935
You may not value your family.

1632
01:47:48,902 --> 01:47:50,904
And you may have severed
all ties with them.

1633
01:47:51,972 --> 01:47:53,841
But we need you, sir.

1634
01:47:56,643 --> 01:47:57,444
Sir.

1635
01:47:59,346 --> 01:48:00,614
Quality isn't good.

1636
01:48:00,714 --> 01:48:02,149
-The quality isn't good these days.
-Sir...

1637
01:48:02,216 --> 01:48:03,483
Sir, please come with me.

1638
01:48:05,519 --> 01:48:09,289
All they want is Chhota Bheem
and Spider-Man cakes.

1639
01:48:09,756 --> 01:48:10,524
What's the name?

1640
01:48:11,525 --> 01:48:12,226
Theekshith.

1641
01:48:13,227 --> 01:48:14,094
Deekshith?

1642
01:48:14,294 --> 01:48:15,929
No, it's Theekshith.

1643
01:48:18,065 --> 01:48:18,932
Give it to me.

1644
01:48:23,337 --> 01:48:24,738
-Theekshith.
-Yeah.

1645
01:48:25,305 --> 01:48:26,406
What a name.

1646
01:48:29,309 --> 01:48:33,914
You care so much for the name
on someone else's birthday cake.

1647
01:48:34,748 --> 01:48:37,351
If only you cared
a bit about your daughter's life,

1648
01:48:38,018 --> 01:48:39,853
we wouldn't have been
in such a situation.

1649
01:48:40,454 --> 01:48:41,722
Spell the name.

1650
01:48:42,656 --> 01:48:43,957
K-S-H...

1651
01:48:44,358 --> 01:48:45,292
Listen to me!

1652
01:48:46,593 --> 01:48:47,528
Please listen.

1653
01:48:49,496 --> 01:48:50,664
I want my Veda back.

1654
01:48:52,299 --> 01:48:53,600
I need my family back.

1655
01:48:55,302 --> 01:48:57,171
For that, she has
to undergo the treatment.

1656
01:48:58,505 --> 01:48:59,806
I don't know
if that's what you want.

1657
01:49:00,841 --> 01:49:02,276
You have to play a part in it.

1658
01:49:03,043 --> 01:49:03,944
A bitter part.

1659
01:49:07,514 --> 01:49:08,215
Come.

1660
01:49:08,916 --> 01:49:09,750
Please.

1661
01:49:43,750 --> 01:49:44,718
Slowly.

1662
01:49:45,185 --> 01:49:47,487
You know nothing.
Who the hell hired you?

1663
01:49:47,554 --> 01:49:48,856
Hello. Namaste.

1664
01:49:50,224 --> 01:49:52,326
There must be a cone there.

1665
01:49:52,392 --> 01:49:54,094
Somewhere down there...

1666
01:49:54,394 --> 01:49:56,363
-Which cone...
-Good morning.

1667
01:49:56,430 --> 01:49:58,732
Your daughter is safe with me.

1668
01:50:00,467 --> 01:50:02,503
Who is he? A new guest?

1669
01:50:04,171 --> 01:50:06,006
Search properly. Slowly.

1670
01:50:06,673 --> 01:50:07,774
He's not a guest,

1671
01:50:07,841 --> 01:50:08,509
Hitler.

1672
01:50:08,575 --> 01:50:09,843
It's in here.

1673
01:50:15,482 --> 01:50:16,917
Is he here to tell the story?

1674
01:50:21,054 --> 01:50:22,356
What kind of a story would Hitler tell?

1675
01:50:25,659 --> 01:50:27,661
[woman singing over music player]

1676
01:50:32,466 --> 01:50:33,400
[in Tamil] Saraswathi's song.

1677
01:50:37,004 --> 01:50:38,739
[song continues]

1678
01:50:47,848 --> 01:50:51,785
Oh, Lord Krishna, you are welcome here

1679
01:50:53,687 --> 01:50:56,957
Oh, Lord Krishna, you are welcome here

1680
01:50:57,024 --> 01:50:58,325
Over there.

1681
01:50:58,692 --> 01:51:04,665
Mukunda, please come to us,
Oh, Lord Krishna

1682
01:51:06,233 --> 01:51:09,703
Please come to us, oh, Lord Krishna

1683
01:51:09,770 --> 01:51:12,639
Oh, Lord Krishna

1684
01:51:14,942 --> 01:51:20,714
Come please to us
With your alluring appearance

1685
01:51:20,914 --> 01:51:25,719
Come please to us
With your alluring appearance

1686
01:51:25,853 --> 01:51:28,889
There is no match for you

1687
01:51:28,956 --> 01:51:32,226
You are the Lord of the world

1688
01:51:39,633 --> 01:51:40,300
Yes!

1689
01:51:41,168 --> 01:51:42,736
I'm not an ordinary
hot-headed man.

1690
01:51:43,770 --> 01:51:44,671
I'm very short-tempered.

1691
01:51:44,738 --> 01:51:45,639
Veda!

1692
01:51:45,706 --> 01:51:49,710
Don't interfere
when I'm teaching her a lesson.

1693
01:51:50,878 --> 01:51:53,146
My daughter made small mistakes.

1694
01:51:53,213 --> 01:51:56,183
But I gave her severe punishment.

1695
01:51:56,750 --> 01:51:58,352
Keep standing, don't move.

1696
01:51:59,920 --> 01:52:03,090
-But there is a reason to it too.
-[in Tamil] Dad, I won't repeat it.

1697
01:52:05,025 --> 01:52:07,094
There's no limit to her intake, sir.

1698
01:52:07,895 --> 01:52:10,531
[coughing] She is still a child...

1699
01:52:10,597 --> 01:52:13,066
How can you punish her
like this for eating?

1700
01:52:13,734 --> 01:52:15,836
At this young age,

1701
01:52:15,903 --> 01:52:18,972
you have high BP,
diabetes and heart problem.

1702
01:52:19,039 --> 01:52:23,076
And your daughter is quite plump
compared to others of her age.

1703
01:52:23,143 --> 01:52:24,645
If this continues,

1704
01:52:24,711 --> 01:52:27,147
she might also get
all these diseases at a young age.

1705
01:52:27,814 --> 01:52:31,151
She could also contract
diseases at young age.

1706
01:52:32,186 --> 01:52:35,155
It would be wise to control from now.

1707
01:52:35,856 --> 01:52:36,723
[Valli wailing]

1708
01:52:36,790 --> 01:52:42,196
Valli was too young
to understand all this.

1709
01:52:42,262 --> 01:52:45,199
[Valli crying] Dad!

1710
01:52:46,266 --> 01:52:48,402
Her mother was ill all the time.

1711
01:52:48,468 --> 01:52:49,870
Why don't you send her on an exile?

1712
01:52:52,272 --> 01:52:53,240
Look,

1713
01:52:53,307 --> 01:52:55,509
in her opinion, I'm Hiranyakashipu

1714
01:52:55,609 --> 01:52:58,178
and her daughter is Bhakta Prahlada.

1715
01:52:58,245 --> 01:53:00,480
And I'm giving her
all the troubles in this world.

1716
01:53:00,681 --> 01:53:03,784
At this stage Narasimha has to come
out of the pillar to kill me.

1717
01:53:04,685 --> 01:53:07,054
The doctor has been worrying us.

1718
01:53:07,321 --> 01:53:08,422
[Valli crying] Mom!

1719
01:53:09,089 --> 01:53:09,990
Mom!

1720
01:53:10,624 --> 01:53:16,230
The fear of losing my family
made me act in this manner.

1721
01:53:28,876 --> 01:53:30,177
[reciting shlokas]

1722
01:53:33,914 --> 01:53:35,015
It was June 1st.

1723
01:53:35,415 --> 01:53:36,350
It was her birthday.

1724
01:53:37,784 --> 01:53:41,522
We were at the temple
to pray for her wellbeing.

1725
01:53:41,588 --> 01:53:42,556
[in Tamil] Don't touch.

1726
01:54:10,851 --> 01:54:12,019
I didn't know how to make
her understand.

1727
01:54:12,653 --> 01:54:15,355
I lost my cool
when she didn't mend her ways.

1728
01:54:16,523 --> 01:54:17,257
So...

1729
01:54:17,324 --> 01:54:20,194
I decided to teach her
an unforgettable lesson...

1730
01:54:20,727 --> 01:54:22,696
Maybe this time she wasn't wrong.

1731
01:54:24,231 --> 01:54:26,834
[in Tamil] No, dad, it's not me.

1732
01:54:27,601 --> 01:54:30,304
Why did you assume that
it's always her mistake?

1733
01:54:34,842 --> 01:54:36,009
Look at this.

1734
01:54:36,710 --> 01:54:37,477
It was empty.

1735
01:54:37,978 --> 01:54:39,112
There was butter in it.

1736
01:54:40,047 --> 01:54:42,082
Who else could it be? It's her.

1737
01:54:42,149 --> 01:54:44,218
And you thought she was at fault.

1738
01:54:44,852 --> 01:54:48,155
[in Tamil] Dad, honestly, it isn't me!

1739
01:54:48,222 --> 01:54:49,289
[shushing]

1740
01:54:51,458 --> 01:54:53,894
I too think it wasn't her fault.

1741
01:54:53,961 --> 01:54:55,495
I mean...

1742
01:55:04,304 --> 01:55:05,138
And then?

1743
01:55:10,344 --> 01:55:12,045
[in Tamil] How dare you lie to me?

1744
01:55:12,479 --> 01:55:14,481
Swerve it. Swerve it faster.

1745
01:55:16,917 --> 01:55:19,219
I'm scared, Dad.

1746
01:55:22,422 --> 01:55:25,626
I'm scared, Dad. Please.

1747
01:55:25,726 --> 01:55:26,927
You stay quiet!

1748
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:42,309
Though the mishap took place
right in front of me,

1749
01:55:42,976 --> 01:55:44,211
I was completely helpless.

1750
01:55:44,878 --> 01:55:46,880
I couldn't save my Saraswathi.

1751
01:55:52,586 --> 01:55:58,926
I don't know how many times I've regretted
doing that one mistake.

1752
01:55:58,992 --> 01:56:02,229
-Veda, dad's right here.-All then I had my daughter with me.

1753
01:56:02,296 --> 01:56:05,132
It seemed like I made a mistake
saving her life.

1754
01:56:06,133 --> 01:56:09,469
I appeared like a demon to her.

1755
01:56:11,271 --> 01:56:15,142
Only Kavitha was
capable of looking after her.

1756
01:56:17,611 --> 01:56:19,346
Manja, don't you have a spare tire?

1757
01:56:19,413 --> 01:56:20,280
Oh, you fool...

1758
01:56:20,347 --> 01:56:23,851
Kavitha stayed home all day and night
to take care of the child,

1759
01:56:24,418 --> 01:56:27,287
that gave rise to a big gossip.

1760
01:56:27,354 --> 01:56:29,456
[indistinct chattering]

1761
01:56:29,523 --> 01:56:31,091
To put an end to these rumours,

1762
01:56:31,592 --> 01:56:33,961
and to not cause any more trouble
to this woman,

1763
01:56:34,394 --> 01:56:36,964
I married her.

1764
01:56:38,165 --> 01:56:41,835
That looked like another mistake
to my daughter.

1765
01:56:41,902 --> 01:56:43,537
Veda, please have your food.

1766
01:56:43,604 --> 01:56:45,272
Hey, where is she?

1767
01:56:45,672 --> 01:56:47,441
-[in Tamil] Mom, come here. Mom...
-Give it to me. I'll feed her.

1768
01:56:47,674 --> 01:56:49,309
Mom, you come here.

-I continued making mistakes.
-Mom...

01:56:51,345 --> 01:56:54,581
Veda didn't listen to me at all.

1771
01:56:55,883 --> 01:56:59,219
Why are you getting angry?
Please talk to the owner.

1772
01:57:03,090 --> 01:57:05,359
Oh, come on in, Mr. Bombe Iyengar.

1773
01:57:05,759 --> 01:57:08,028
You've shown up at our restaurant
for the first time.

1774
01:57:08,095 --> 01:57:10,130
Have some tea. We won't charge you.

1775
01:57:10,464 --> 01:57:11,231
Look at your daughter,

1776
01:57:11,298 --> 01:57:13,634
she's eating to her heart's content.

1777
01:57:14,101 --> 01:57:15,602
I wouldn't have sent you the bill.

1778
01:57:15,669 --> 01:57:19,907
But since you talk about the right,
the law, and the truth,

1779
01:57:19,973 --> 01:57:21,608
-I sent the bill to you.-But...

1780
01:57:22,009 --> 01:57:24,244
In order to teach me a lesson,

1781
01:57:25,379 --> 01:57:27,981
to punish me for my mistakes...

1782
01:57:29,616 --> 01:57:32,419
Do you know what my daughter did?

1783
01:58:04,484 --> 01:58:06,153
[fire crackling]

1784
01:58:09,089 --> 01:58:11,258
[breathing heavily]

1785
01:58:34,681 --> 01:58:38,218
As she grew up,
her hatred towards me grew too.

1786
01:58:39,520 --> 01:58:41,788
I didn't get a chance to talk to her.

1787
01:58:43,690 --> 01:58:44,758
In these 25 years,

1788
01:58:45,392 --> 01:58:47,027
I didn't even get a chance.

1789
01:58:50,264 --> 01:58:53,967
You snatched away her mother
and kicked her out of the house

1790
01:58:54,801 --> 01:58:57,771
What do you mean
you didn't get a chance?

1791
01:58:58,405 --> 01:58:59,139
Latthesh,

1792
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:03,844
it means he didn't get a chance
to speak with her.

1793
01:59:04,211 --> 01:59:05,312
It doesn't mean a thing!

1794
01:59:06,313 --> 01:59:09,983
She grew up like an orphan
even though her father was alive.

1795
01:59:11,251 --> 01:59:14,788
Ask him if he has fulfilled
his duties as a father.

1796
01:59:15,255 --> 01:59:15,956
Ask him!

1797
01:59:17,357 --> 01:59:20,427
Varadharajan, you ought to answer this.

1798
01:59:20,994 --> 01:59:22,095
Please answer.

1799
01:59:23,230 --> 01:59:24,464
Don't hide anything from us.

1800
01:59:26,433 --> 01:59:27,801
Is this an house or an hotel?

1801
01:59:28,402 --> 01:59:30,337
To come and go when and how she pleases.

1802
01:59:30,771 --> 01:59:32,306
Is there any responsibility left?

1803
01:59:33,140 --> 01:59:33,841
Hey, Ranga,

1804
01:59:34,341 --> 01:59:35,943
tell her she shouldn't touch anything.

1805
01:59:36,009 --> 01:59:37,711
These are my mother's memories!

1806
01:59:38,846 --> 01:59:40,013
What do you want now?

1807
01:59:40,380 --> 01:59:42,149
You snatched my mother from me.

1808
01:59:42,683 --> 01:59:44,818
But you can't snatch away
her memories from me.

1809
01:59:45,452 --> 01:59:46,820
I'll break your bones, Ranga.

1810
01:59:46,887 --> 01:59:48,555
Dad... Dad...

1811
01:59:48,622 --> 01:59:50,991
No one can take this away from me!

1812
01:59:51,058 --> 01:59:55,762
I tried with all my will
to apologize to her.

1813
01:59:56,864 --> 01:59:58,632
But she distanced herself
from me and the house.

1814
01:59:59,499 --> 02:00:02,069
-Please wear the helmet, cops are around.
-Hey, leave me alone!

1815
02:00:02,135 --> 02:00:03,337
You are such a specimen.

1816
02:00:06,607 --> 02:00:08,141
She started to live

1817
02:00:08,208 --> 02:00:10,010
-in her friends and others' homes.
-Wow, what's this?

1818
02:00:11,945 --> 02:00:13,146
-Hey.
-Hey...

1819
02:00:13,213 --> 02:00:14,848
That is boti fry.

1820
02:00:15,249 --> 02:00:17,985
Let her eat. She's a hungry mongrel.

1821
02:00:18,285 --> 02:00:20,721
They will eat anything from anywhere.

1822
02:00:21,054 --> 02:00:23,123
-You eat.-Despite being shamed

1823
02:00:23,190 --> 02:00:24,791
and pained in those houses,

1824
02:00:25,092 --> 02:00:27,928
she believed she did not have anyone.

1825
02:00:27,995 --> 02:00:28,795
[people clamouring]

1826
02:00:28,896 --> 02:00:31,164
She will not go anywhere,
she will stay right here.

1827
02:00:31,231 --> 02:00:32,933
You go to the room.

1828
02:00:33,133 --> 02:00:34,034
She will stay right here...

1829
02:00:34,101 --> 02:00:37,337
I thought she would be happy
if she got married and I tried that too.

1830
02:00:37,504 --> 02:00:38,472
-But...
-Why?

1831
02:00:38,539 --> 02:00:42,809
Can anyone accept
a murderer as their father?

1832
02:00:44,344 --> 02:00:45,312
Finally, one day,

1833
02:00:46,213 --> 02:00:51,251
I saw my daughter happy and content on TV.

1834
02:00:51,585 --> 02:00:54,521
They talk behind her back
at the office.

1835
02:00:55,289 --> 02:00:56,723
But I don't have
any problem with that.

1836
02:00:56,790 --> 02:00:57,891
I'm still ready, you know.

1837
02:00:58,592 --> 02:01:00,994
-Do you know where she is?
-Yes, uncle, I do.

1838
02:01:01,061 --> 02:01:03,630
Her friend, the fatty, Swapna,
tell her to come as well.

1839
02:01:03,931 --> 02:01:04,898
See you, aunty.

1840
02:01:05,465 --> 02:01:07,668
Tie this around her neck
if you're a man.

1841
02:01:08,468 --> 02:01:10,604
I thought she would be happy
with Latthesh,

1842
02:01:11,538 --> 02:01:15,042
so I turned vile
to get her married to him.

1843
02:01:20,681 --> 02:01:24,151
Someone cast an evil eye
on her happy family.

1844
02:01:25,018 --> 02:01:27,688
I heard she met with an accident
and had lost all her memory.

1845
02:01:28,555 --> 02:01:30,657
I couldn't gather the courage
to talk to you.

1846
02:01:30,724 --> 02:01:31,425
I don't know, sir...

1847
02:01:32,192 --> 02:01:33,627
I plead you.

1848
02:01:34,061 --> 02:01:35,963
Please save her!

1849
02:01:36,363 --> 02:01:37,097
Come.

1850
02:01:39,600 --> 02:01:41,134
Two people have to forgive me.

1851
02:01:43,937 --> 02:01:45,539
One, my daughter,

1852
02:01:47,474 --> 02:01:48,342
and the other...

1853
02:01:50,377 --> 02:01:52,112
One who endured
all the pain

1854
02:01:52,980 --> 02:01:55,549
but living with me
with a label of wife.

1855
02:01:56,850 --> 02:01:57,718
She's like my daughter.

1856
02:01:59,353 --> 02:02:01,154
Please stop it.

1857
02:02:13,534 --> 02:02:15,135
I have to bake a cake for tomorrow.

1858
02:02:23,744 --> 02:02:27,114
I called him Hitler. Now he has
become a hero in my eyes.

1859
02:02:27,481 --> 02:02:31,185
Tomorrow is my birthday.
Will you bake me a rose cake?

1860
02:02:31,285 --> 02:02:36,190
Oh, Adi Keshava, you dwell in Udupi

1861
02:02:36,657 --> 02:02:40,194
I am Kanaka, a humble devotee

1862
02:02:41,929 --> 02:02:42,796
How do you say "go?"

1863
02:02:43,597 --> 02:02:44,331
[in Tamil] Podi.

1864
02:02:46,066 --> 02:02:47,000
How do you say "come?"

1865
02:02:47,334 --> 02:02:48,168
Vaadi.

1866
02:02:48,802 --> 02:02:49,937
How do you say "sit?"

1867
02:02:50,103 --> 02:02:50,904
Vakaarudi.

1868
02:02:50,971 --> 02:02:53,874
-Oh, so just add "Di" for everything?
-Of course.

1869
02:02:53,941 --> 02:02:56,276
Come-di, go-di, sit-di...

1870
02:02:56,343 --> 02:02:57,344
Cheddi.

1871
02:02:59,246 --> 02:02:59,980
Here.

1872
02:03:03,684 --> 02:03:04,585
Uncle...

1873
02:03:05,519 --> 02:03:10,424
I will pray specially for you
to reunite with your daughter.

1874
02:03:13,126 --> 02:03:14,895
Oh, Great Lord,

1875
02:03:16,597 --> 02:03:18,232
what is this divine play!

1876
02:03:19,733 --> 02:03:23,837
[chuckles] Each and everyone here
are such pure souls.

1877
02:03:24,338 --> 02:03:26,340
But this situation

1878
02:03:26,406 --> 02:03:29,109
is portraying everyone the exact opposite.

1879
02:03:29,510 --> 02:03:31,778
Is this the fate
everyone talks about?

1880
02:03:32,846 --> 02:03:34,915
Although everything seemed crystal clear,

1881
02:03:34,982 --> 02:03:38,886
it wasn't what it appeared to be.

1882
02:03:43,757 --> 02:03:47,361
If only the players were aware
of the game of fate,

1883
02:03:47,728 --> 02:03:49,129
things would've been a lot better.

1884
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,435
-Do you really want to have it?
-Mmm.

1885
02:03:58,605 --> 02:04:00,440
What a game, bro.

1886
02:04:00,507 --> 02:04:03,110
His father who was known to be Hitler,

1887
02:04:03,177 --> 02:04:04,378
is now a good man.

1888
02:04:04,444 --> 02:04:06,647
Who is left out? It's me.

1889
02:04:07,414 --> 02:04:10,484
The biggest villain of her life.

1890
02:04:12,052 --> 02:04:15,422
She can pretend as much as possible,

1891
02:04:16,190 --> 02:04:20,761
but she won't be able to suppress
her anger on me.

1892
02:04:21,862 --> 02:04:23,230
And that's why...

1893
02:04:23,797 --> 02:04:26,400
To try and bring her memories back,

1894
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:31,505
I had to play a role in this act.

1895
02:04:33,473 --> 02:04:35,142
But it was of no use.

1896
02:04:43,517 --> 02:04:45,853
A lifetime's rage...

1897
02:04:45,919 --> 02:04:47,788
you smacked me to pulp.

1898
02:04:53,193 --> 02:04:54,027
Forgive me.

1899
02:04:54,695 --> 02:04:55,896
Don't.

1900
02:04:56,630 --> 02:04:57,898
You are a good man.

1901
02:04:58,465 --> 02:04:59,867
Latthesha!

1902
02:05:00,968 --> 02:05:02,202
Drink up.

1903
02:05:02,269 --> 02:05:03,904
You need some tonic too.

1904
02:05:04,338 --> 02:05:05,439
Valli...

1905
02:05:05,806 --> 02:05:06,874
forgive me.

1906
02:05:07,207 --> 02:05:09,676
I just want you to regain your memory.

1907
02:05:10,477 --> 02:05:15,048
May the darkness dissolve
into this night.

1908
02:05:16,116 --> 02:05:20,153
And may the light pour
in some hope too.

1909
02:05:21,054 --> 02:05:26,360
May this story end with
Veda getting new lease of life.

1910
02:05:27,694 --> 02:05:29,062
This is my prayer.

1911
02:06:16,810 --> 02:06:17,544
Lalli.

1912
02:06:18,312 --> 02:06:19,179
Lalli!

1913
02:06:19,580 --> 02:06:20,447
Come here.

1914
02:06:22,149 --> 02:06:23,016
Latthesha...

1915
02:06:23,517 --> 02:06:25,786
Look, the calendar has gone thin.

1916
02:06:26,386 --> 02:06:28,622
Why is she still not talking?

1917
02:06:29,223 --> 02:06:31,191
Tell her to talk to me, Latthesha.

1918
02:06:31,892 --> 02:06:32,926
I'm not telling her anything.

1919
02:06:45,973 --> 02:06:47,774
You made a promise.

1920
02:06:55,015 --> 02:06:57,851
Cheater... Cheater... Cheater...

1921
02:07:02,189 --> 02:07:04,358
Promise... Promise...

1922
02:07:05,225 --> 02:07:06,527
-You made a promise...
-Hey!

1923
02:07:07,060 --> 02:07:09,129
Don't you have manners!
Don't be so stubborn.

1924
02:07:09,796 --> 02:07:11,465
-Come with me!
-Leave me!

1925
02:07:11,965 --> 02:07:13,166
-Leave me.
-Leave her alone.

1926
02:07:13,233 --> 02:07:14,535
Where are you going?

1927
02:07:15,135 --> 02:07:16,236
Valli...

1928
02:07:17,337 --> 02:07:18,906
Valli, come here!

1929
02:07:20,374 --> 02:07:22,576
-Grandpa...
-I'm already repenting for my mistakes,

1930
02:07:22,643 --> 02:07:24,912
don't make the same mistake. Please.

1931
02:07:24,978 --> 02:07:26,246
-Latthesh...
-Come!

1932
02:07:26,313 --> 02:07:28,482
-[people clamouring]
-This is not part of the treatment.

1933
02:07:28,549 --> 02:07:29,816
You want a birthday?

1934
02:07:30,284 --> 02:07:32,352
You and your mom want to celebrate?

1935
02:07:32,653 --> 02:07:34,788
-I'll teach you a lesson now!
-Valli!

1936
02:07:35,923 --> 02:07:37,991
-Shut up!
-What are you doing, Latthesh!

1937
02:07:38,625 --> 02:07:40,194
Valli!

1938
02:07:40,260 --> 02:07:41,061
Say now.

1939
02:07:41,128 --> 02:07:42,863
-I won't.
-Sing "Happy birthday."

1940
02:07:42,930 --> 02:07:44,998
-I won't.
-You won't?

1941
02:07:45,065 --> 02:07:45,966
No!

1942
02:07:46,033 --> 02:07:47,167
Valli!

1943
02:07:47,935 --> 02:07:48,936
Valli...

1944
02:07:49,002 --> 02:07:50,437
Sing "Happy birthday!"

1945
02:07:50,504 --> 02:07:51,972
-What are you doing?
-Hey!

1946
02:07:52,973 --> 02:07:54,274
Step back!

1947
02:07:54,341 --> 02:07:55,576
I'll burn you. Go away.

1948
02:07:55,642 --> 02:07:58,178
Are you out of your mind?
She's just a child.

1949
02:07:58,245 --> 02:07:59,179
Is this some game?

1950
02:08:00,113 --> 02:08:03,350
Veda, your child is experiencing
the pain you went through.

1951
02:08:04,084 --> 02:08:05,285
[crying]

1952
02:08:06,086 --> 02:08:07,154
Are you listening?

1953
02:08:08,422 --> 02:08:10,691
Nobody came to your rescue

1954
02:08:10,757 --> 02:08:12,659
that's why you are sick today.

1955
02:08:12,793 --> 02:08:16,263
I'm sorry, Dad. I won't repeat it.

1956
02:08:16,330 --> 02:08:16,997
Valli...

1957
02:08:17,064 --> 02:08:19,299
-Sing "Happy birthday."
-Stop it!

1958
02:08:19,366 --> 02:08:21,702
Happy birthday to you...

1959
02:08:21,768 --> 02:08:26,139
Only you can save your daughter
from her father.

1960
02:08:26,206 --> 02:08:27,641
[in Tamil] Dad, I won't repeat...

1961
02:08:27,708 --> 02:08:29,109
Valli!

1962
02:08:29,676 --> 02:08:30,844
Listen to her.

1963
02:08:31,245 --> 02:08:33,614
Your daughter is screaming
for help.

1964
02:08:33,680 --> 02:08:34,882
Valli!

1965
02:08:34,948 --> 02:08:36,617
Mom! Mom!

1966
02:08:36,683 --> 02:08:38,151
Go save her.

1967
02:08:39,152 --> 02:08:40,320
Valli!

1968
02:08:42,055 --> 02:08:44,124
If you don't respond now,

1969
02:08:44,591 --> 02:08:47,227
your daughter will have
to go through the same ordeal.

1970
02:08:48,896 --> 02:08:50,264
Valli...

1971
02:08:51,064 --> 02:08:53,000
Go!

1972
02:08:55,969 --> 02:08:59,306
[in Tamil] No, Dad, I won't do it.

1973
02:09:00,641 --> 02:09:01,642
[crying]

1974
02:09:06,146 --> 02:09:07,614
[in Tamil] No, Dad.

1975
02:09:08,182 --> 02:09:10,784
I won't repeat it again.

1976
02:09:11,151 --> 02:09:12,886
I won't.

1977
02:09:13,854 --> 02:09:15,455
I'm scared, Dad.

1978
02:09:17,191 --> 02:09:19,126
Mom... [crying]

1979
02:09:21,295 --> 02:09:22,996
Come to me, Mom.

1980
02:09:26,066 --> 02:09:27,434
Mom... [crying]

1981
02:09:28,468 --> 02:09:29,336
Who are you?

1982
02:09:30,137 --> 02:09:30,804
Sarah.

1983
02:09:31,205 --> 02:09:33,173
Not Sarah-Maari, Sarah Mary.

1984
02:09:34,808 --> 02:09:36,710
Then why did you shout
"Father"?

1985
02:09:36,777 --> 02:09:37,644
I...

1986
02:09:37,711 --> 02:09:38,979
I am Veda.

1987
02:09:39,046 --> 02:09:42,416
Can anyone accept
a murderer as their father?

1988
02:09:44,051 --> 02:09:45,252
Will you accept?

1989
02:09:45,819 --> 02:09:51,491
It's all my fault

1990
02:09:53,427 --> 02:09:54,361
Ready?

1991
02:09:54,428 --> 02:09:57,631
It's all my fault

1992
02:09:57,731 --> 02:10:01,969
I played games with my life

1993
02:10:04,905 --> 02:10:08,041
Are you Sarah or Veda?

1994
02:10:08,709 --> 02:10:10,043
This is very interesting.

1995
02:10:10,110 --> 02:10:11,812
Please, tell me the story?

1996
02:10:12,613 --> 02:10:14,248
Yes, Sundarajan.

1997
02:10:15,048 --> 02:10:16,116
That's right.

1998
02:10:17,084 --> 02:10:19,152
Why did I say Varadharajan?

1999
02:10:21,955 --> 02:10:24,291
Hello. Doctor,

2000
02:10:24,358 --> 02:10:27,394
-Veda is talking about Varadharajan.
-Oh, okay.

2001
02:10:27,895 --> 02:10:30,998
Where am I going
with packed bags?

2002
02:10:31,532 --> 02:10:36,436
And when he uttered that word

2003
02:10:38,505 --> 02:10:41,008
The taste seems quite familiar.

2004
02:10:42,042 --> 02:10:46,847
In fact, it gives a sense of belonging
in an unknown place like this.

2005
02:10:47,481 --> 02:10:48,749
My life changed forever.

2006
02:10:48,815 --> 02:10:49,750
How?

2007
02:10:50,517 --> 02:10:51,752
It was ruined, madam.

2008
02:10:52,085 --> 02:10:53,353
Shattered into pieces.

2009
02:10:53,420 --> 02:10:58,091
This body that is the shrine,
He is my lord...

2010
02:10:59,760 --> 02:11:00,861
Latthesha...

2011
02:11:00,928 --> 02:11:02,963
[breathing heavily] Latthesha...

2012
02:11:04,064 --> 02:11:05,165
I remember everything.

2013
02:11:07,334 --> 02:11:09,269
That day...

2014
02:11:10,003 --> 02:11:13,273
It was raining heavily.

2015
02:11:15,609 --> 02:11:18,645
-[indistinct argument]-And we had a terrible fight.

2016
02:11:20,013 --> 02:11:23,951
You took Lalli out.

2017
02:11:27,187 --> 02:11:33,193
Don't worry about being a poor man...

2018
02:11:35,662 --> 02:11:38,899
Answer the call. Answer the call, please.

2019
02:11:38,966 --> 02:11:42,169
There are two orphans
in this house, not one.

2020
02:11:43,604 --> 02:11:44,838
I was a born orphan

2021
02:11:45,906 --> 02:11:46,940
and you...

2022
02:11:48,375 --> 02:11:49,510
No!

2023
02:11:50,544 --> 02:11:51,512
Dad...

2024
02:11:52,479 --> 02:11:53,747
I'm sorry...

2025
02:11:53,847 --> 02:11:58,519
He who was with me at all times
Is still here

2026
02:12:02,723 --> 02:12:04,057
[horn blaring]

2027
02:12:07,928 --> 02:12:10,130
[screaming]

2028
02:12:25,913 --> 02:12:27,714
[screaming]

2029
02:12:32,786 --> 02:12:33,687
Posterior.

2030
02:12:34,087 --> 02:12:36,790
Her that part of the brain
is injured,

2031
02:12:37,357 --> 02:12:40,594
which usually makes the patient
lose their memory completely.

2032
02:12:41,495 --> 02:12:43,063
Be seated here. I'll be right back.

2033
02:12:43,564 --> 02:12:46,099
Hey, Sundarajan,
enough with the decoration. Come.

2034
02:12:50,237 --> 02:12:51,338
Hey, Sundarajan...

2035
02:12:53,307 --> 02:12:54,708
Varadharajan!

2036
02:12:56,510 --> 02:12:57,911
Sundarajan!

2037
02:12:58,812 --> 02:13:01,181
Sundarajan!

2038
02:13:02,583 --> 02:13:04,651
He has always been by my side...

2039
02:13:04,718 --> 02:13:06,119
Sundarajan!

2040
02:13:10,691 --> 02:13:16,697
To celebrate the victory
Of my life's journey

2041
02:13:18,699 --> 02:13:19,900
Who are you?

2042
02:13:22,870 --> 02:13:23,904
Sa...

2043
02:13:24,137 --> 02:13:25,205
Sarah.

2044
02:13:25,472 --> 02:13:27,708
He came in as my chauffeur...

2045
02:13:27,774 --> 02:13:29,076
Sarah.

2046
02:13:30,978 --> 02:13:31,879
Sarah.

2047
02:13:33,213 --> 02:13:34,781
It's your mother's name, dear.

2048
02:13:36,984 --> 02:13:37,985
Saraswathi.

2049
02:13:39,553 --> 02:13:41,388
Sa-Ra...

2050
02:13:42,689 --> 02:13:44,525
Saraswathi.

2051
02:13:49,129 --> 02:13:51,965
She met with an accident on her birthday.

2052
02:13:52,299 --> 02:13:53,500
-That is...
-On the 1st.

2053
02:13:55,035 --> 02:13:57,938
-How many of you were on the boat, sir?
-Three of us.

2054
02:13:58,739 --> 02:13:59,673
Sixth month.

2055
02:14:01,708 --> 02:14:03,844
And how many of you survived?

2056
02:14:10,184 --> 02:14:12,553
You're... not Veda.

2057
02:14:13,253 --> 02:14:15,689
Then... who are you?

2058
02:14:18,859 --> 02:14:19,927
I'm Dr. Arohi.

2059
02:14:20,894 --> 02:14:22,729
Dr. Francis' assistant.

2060
02:14:22,796 --> 02:14:26,600
I plead to you. Please save her.

2061
02:14:26,667 --> 02:14:27,601
Sir, look...

2062
02:14:28,235 --> 02:14:29,336
She's making notes.

2063
02:14:29,403 --> 02:14:30,671
See... See here.

2064
02:14:32,272 --> 02:14:34,007
She has mentioned about the boat incident.

2065
02:14:36,143 --> 02:14:37,444
The rest is left to you, Latthesh.

2066
02:14:37,511 --> 02:14:39,213
He has my back at all times...

2067
02:14:39,279 --> 02:14:41,081
-Valli!
-Sing, "Happy birthday!"

2068
02:14:41,682 --> 02:14:43,717
Veda, see...

2069
02:14:44,484 --> 02:14:45,719
See...

2070
02:14:46,687 --> 02:14:47,855
Please listen.

2071
02:14:49,623 --> 02:14:50,624
See...

2072
02:14:53,460 --> 02:14:58,131
Your facial hair is hiding your love

2073
02:14:58,565 --> 02:15:00,234
that's why she's
unable to spot it.

2074
02:15:00,300 --> 02:15:03,403
He's the lord of my soul, my soul mate...

2075
02:15:04,104 --> 02:15:06,139
Hold on. Who is that girl?

2076
02:15:11,545 --> 02:15:12,312
This is her.

2077
02:15:16,517 --> 02:15:18,452
Please, continue.
Now I can follow the story.

2078
02:15:19,853 --> 02:15:21,221
[crying]

2079
02:15:24,024 --> 02:15:25,959
Why did I even recall all this?

2080
02:15:29,563 --> 02:15:33,166
Things would've been better
had I forgotten Veda.

2081
02:15:35,536 --> 02:15:39,840
He won't let go of me

2082
02:15:43,644 --> 02:15:46,980
He's the lord of my soul, my soul mate

2083
02:15:49,483 --> 02:15:54,021
He won't let go of me

2084
02:15:56,823 --> 02:15:58,458
[sobbing]

2085
02:16:07,901 --> 02:16:09,903
No, Latthesha. No.

2086
02:16:10,537 --> 02:16:11,705
You have no idea.

2087
02:16:11,772 --> 02:16:14,174
This Veda is an unpleasant woman.

2088
02:16:14,274 --> 02:16:16,043
She troubles everybody.

2089
02:16:16,476 --> 02:16:18,445
You deserved better than me in your life.

2090
02:16:18,512 --> 02:16:21,315
Leave me alone. Please.

2091
02:16:21,815 --> 02:16:22,850
No...

2092
02:16:23,116 --> 02:16:24,351
-No.
-[shushing]

2093
02:16:24,418 --> 02:16:27,254
No... [crying] No...

2094
02:16:35,062 --> 02:16:35,762
Anger...

2095
02:16:40,234 --> 02:16:40,934
rage...

2096
02:16:44,805 --> 02:16:45,572
fear...

2097
02:17:03,056 --> 02:17:03,724
love...

2098
02:17:11,365 --> 02:17:12,065
love...

2099
02:17:16,136 --> 02:17:16,803
love...

2100
02:18:20,901 --> 02:18:22,236
[light flickering]

2101
02:18:23,003 --> 02:18:24,137
Oh, light up soon.

2102
02:18:24,471 --> 02:18:26,273
Oh, come on!

2103
02:18:30,043 --> 02:18:30,711
Hey!

2104
02:18:31,845 --> 02:18:34,114
Fix the lamp, okay?

2105
02:18:36,316 --> 02:18:38,452
I don't know how they fixed the light

2106
02:18:38,519 --> 02:18:40,954
I wasn't here for two days
and everyone's lost their mind.

2107
02:18:41,021 --> 02:18:42,956
And this bulb too.

2108
02:18:43,290 --> 02:18:44,358
Screw you!

2109
02:18:45,025 --> 02:18:49,229
Each cuisine

2110
02:18:49,296 --> 02:18:52,566
Has its own ingredients and measurements

2111
02:18:53,901 --> 02:18:57,804
An accompaniment of asafoetida,
Coconut-oil and butter

2112
02:18:58,705 --> 02:19:02,142
Along with a pinch of love

2113
02:19:03,110 --> 02:19:12,186
Cooked well, a flavoured delight
Else, a bowl of nasty bite

2114
02:19:12,252 --> 02:19:20,494
Cooked well, a flavoured delight
Else, a bowl of nasty bite

2115
02:19:21,562 --> 02:19:24,898
What are the ingredients

2116
02:19:24,965 --> 02:19:29,536
To this gourmet meal?

2117
02:19:30,637 --> 02:19:34,308
A dash of sweet, bitter and sour

2118
02:19:35,209 --> 02:19:39,012
And a bit of astringent and pungent

2119
02:19:39,847 --> 02:19:43,250
But salt

2120
02:19:44,218 --> 02:19:45,652
As per taste

2121
02:19:48,889 --> 02:19:54,094
It was a treat for the eyes and palate...

2122
02:19:54,161 --> 02:19:55,095
What...

2123
02:19:55,996 --> 02:19:58,398
So you're Bheemasena Nalamaharaja?

2124
02:19:58,465 --> 02:19:59,566
-Yes.
-Yeah.

2125
02:20:00,133 --> 02:20:02,469
Okay, I've an offer for you.

2126
02:20:03,303 --> 02:20:06,273
I will fall again purposely,

2127
02:20:06,607 --> 02:20:08,275
and hurt my head again.

2128
02:20:08,509 --> 02:20:11,478
Will you do all this for me again?

2129
02:20:15,048 --> 02:20:16,783
-Hey!
-Hey!

2130
02:20:17,251 --> 02:20:18,252
You...

2131
02:20:20,587 --> 02:20:21,555
Not once...

2132
02:20:22,523 --> 02:20:23,557
but a hundred times.

2133
02:20:23,624 --> 02:20:28,729
Each grain of rice

2134
02:20:29,396 --> 02:20:34,434
has two names written on it.
