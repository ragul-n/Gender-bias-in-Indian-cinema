00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:01,860
RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

2
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:06,000
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

3
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,360
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION

4
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,360
Thank God we meet again.

5
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,200
What happened, brother?

6
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,600
Nothing.

7
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,160
I was worried about you.

8
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,500
Are you fine, Leila?

9
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,960
I am. But...

10
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,230
...you do not seem so well.

11
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,200
You look pale.

12
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,560
Is there a problem?

13
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,430
I am just fine...

14
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,200
...my beautiful sister.
I am fine.

15
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,830
Who is she?

16
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,930
A wounded girl.

17
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:42,930
When the physician said
that she needs to be looked after...

18
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,230
...I could not turn my back.
I wanted to look after her.

19
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,900
With God's permission, when she recovers,
she can be friends with Leila.

20
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:54,930
You thought well, governess.

21
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,930
But this news surprised me.

22
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,900
It is known that my beautiful sister is
distant to all strangers for years.

23
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,900
I wish I could, to not to upset you,
but there is not much unfortunately.

24
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:15,190
Do not talk like that, my child.
Leila is trying hard to get better.

25
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,330
We should not remind her
of such anxieties.

26
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,530
You are right, governess.

27
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,300
With God's permission, this poor girl...

28
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,360
...should recover quickly.

29
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,860
She is very beautiful. God Bless.

30
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,460
God Bless. God Bless.

31
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,500
My Leila...

32
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,560
...rose of my heart.

33
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,000
It makes me so happy to see
that you are making an effort.

34
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,600
Where have you been?
I was so worried about you.

35
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,800
Governess...

36
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,900
...they were really going to
execute my uncle.

37
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,000
But then...

38
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,960
...he showed up.

39
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:00,460
You have my deepest gratitude.

40
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,200
You have put yourself in trouble for me.

41
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,860
Do not worry, my Bey.
Us Turkmens have a saying...

42
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,360
...you know it as well.

43
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,360
If your friend likes trouble, you too
should be ready for the consequences.

44
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,600
We could not find Sahabeddin and
the people who abducted him.

45
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,230
It’s like they disappeared
off the face of the earth.

46
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:22,460
At every street, at every corner
you shall have guards.

47
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,530
Give special importance to places like the
lodge or bookseller where he frequented.

48
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:29,160
Deploy more guards at the gates of the city!

49
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,020
No matter what, they should not
step out of Aleppo.

50
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:32,960
Understood?

51
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,540
Is there any news about Afsin Bey?

52
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,900
You should have known him by now, my Bey.

53
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,400
We cannot hear from him
unless he wants us to.

54
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,130
He put on his shroud and infiltrated
into the heartland of the infidels.

55
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:49,100
We do not know whether he'd surface
in Frank territory or in a Persian city.

56
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:58,100
ANTIOCH,
THE EARLDOM OF THE CRUSADERS

57
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,160
What is your wish from the door of God, stranger?

58
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:21,830
I wish to rest under the shadow of the wild pear.

59
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,100
Afsin Bey?

60
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:45,830
-Brother Saltuk.
-It is you.

61
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,560
Come on in.

62
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,900
Come on, tell us, brother Saltuk.

63
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,830
How do the days pass at the war zone?

64
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,500
How can they pass, my Bey?

65
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:11,430
Amongst these icons, I recite Surah Al-Imran
to keep my faith strong.

66
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,130
Fate loves the effort, brother Saltuk.

67
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:19,530
One day, what you have suffered will
turn into a God’s compassion.

68
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,860
Did you bring me good news from Ahlat?

69
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:26,860
Is it time for the holy call of the Supreme?

70
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,500
No, brother Saltuk,
the time has not come yet.

71
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,260
But you have to take on
a very important mission at the moment.

72
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,000
Just say it, my Bey.
Your order is always welcomed.

73
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:42,030
They imprisoned some of our people in the
Templars Castle in Amanos Mountains.

74
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,400
I have to go in to see how they are.

75
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,300
There is a way.

76
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:14,960
It made you so handsome.

77
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,230
You look just like a prince.

78
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,030
Didn't you like your attire?

79
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,330
No, I liked it very much.

80
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,330
Are you thinking about your brother Turgut?

81
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,930
Only he can take me
to my father and sister.

82
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,900
Alright.
I will talk with my uncle for you.

83
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,430
He surely would know
where your brother Turgut is.

84
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,030
No, don't ask him.
They would put me in his cell as well.

85
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,330
Do you know where he is?

86
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,330
He is here. In the castle.

87
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,530
But they treat him very badly.

88
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,030
Actually, my brother Turgut
can beat them all if he wants.

89
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,930
-He is very strong but...
-But what?

90
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,030
But the knights tied up
his hands and feet.

91
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:11,230
Maybe your brother Turgut committed
a big crime and that's why he is there.

92
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,930
Never! Brother Turgut did nothing else
but protect me.

93
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:03,330
Did you see a man
who looked like a madman?

94
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,900
You mean the man who passed by
just before you.

95
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,330
He went that way.

96
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,480
I have to go upstairs, my Bey.

97
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,200
It is better to not to leave the shop unattended.

98
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,680
The traitors shouldn’t be suspicious about me.

99
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,000
There is no news from my mad men,
can you ask your mad men?

100
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:44,260
Where they are, is there any news?

101
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:47,000
I saw the spark
in the eyes of your men, my Bey.

102
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:49,930
They are probably still
beating up the guards outside.

103
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:53,530
You can be rest assured.
But I will still inquire about them.

104
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:04,800
It is obvious that the Templars'
only aim was not killing me in the palace.

105
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,100
What’s the plot that they are
planning on you?

106
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:11,160
I’m not their concern, but Aleppo is.

107
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:17,860
When the Crusaders invaded Jerusalem,
this group called Templars came to life.

108
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:22,160
They tricked the Pope and
then all the Christians.

109
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:27,900
They made everyone accept that
they were the only guards of Jerusalem.

110
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:31,960
They collected gold and land
from thousands of people.

111
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:39,000
Then with greatness and permission of God,
Saladin Ayyubi conquered Jerusalem...

112
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,830
...and no one cared for them anymore.

113
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:49,330
So, what they are after now, is their reputation
which has been demolished.

114
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:55,000
That is why they aim to raise cain
and create uproar.

115
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,500
Let them plot their plans.

116
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,600
We always say that
the strong can destroy the plot.

117
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,460
We will first get you out of these slanders...

118
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,460
...and then we will hit them in a moment
that they expect us the least.

119
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,030
For the sake of Jesus.

120
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,800
Our relief of getting rid of Sahabeddin
didn’t last for long.

121
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:23,160
-Did you find a clue?
-No.

122
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:27,360
But I'm looking for them in every hole.
I will find him sooner or later.

123
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,930
I will find him and
the wild herders who saved him.

124
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,300
What about El Aziz? Was he terrified?

125
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,960
He was.

126
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,930
He ran away from the traitors who attempted
to kill him and hid in his room.

127
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,960
-But then...
-Then?

128
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,560
He is in a strange mood.

129
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,260
Don't neglect your visits to him.

130
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,860
Where is our Ertugrul Bey?

131
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,830
Under the ground.

132
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,330
Come with me.

133
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,160
Where have you been, Dogan?

134
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:29,130
You know this bear, my Bey. When he sees
a fight, he can't get enough of it.

135
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,000
You were not followed, right?

136
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,600
Is such thing possible, my Bey?

137
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,260
We also have a pair of eyes on our backs.

138
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,260
Bamsi is right, my Bey.

139
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:44,460
As he broke the arms, legs and heads
of the people who were after us...

140
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,460
You have an important job
tomorrow morning.

141
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,900
After today’s loss, Nasir can risk anything.

142
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:56,200
So, you need to go to the lodge tomorrow and
get Halime and the Shahzada out of there.

143
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,130
Who is she?
Where did she come from, governess?

144
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,360
She was a guest at the lodge.

145
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,460
I don't know what happened to her
but her wound was infected.

146
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,360
When the physician said that she should be
treated in the palace, I brought her here.

147
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,960
Yes but why did you bring her
to my room, governess?

148
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:28,830
She is a poor, little girl.

149
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,360
I hoped that she would be your friend.

150
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,830
Leila...

151
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,300
...if you are angry...
-Not at all!

152
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,500
But don't you know that
I don't like to be friends with anyone?

153
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,860
Let the poor girl come to herself first...

154
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:47,100
...if you still don't want her,
we can take her to another room.

155
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:34,060
Thank God you are fine. I was so worried
about you when I heard what happened.

156
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:42,260
Forgive me if it’s not the right moment
for me to be here.

157
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:48,840
Listen to my moan and ask me what it is

158
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,830
Call it as love after everything I’ve suffered

159
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:56,130
Let my name disappear

160
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,800
Shall not call me El Aziz

161
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:03,430
Call it happiness
When you describe me

162
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:11,100
Magnificent. The most beautiful poem
I have heard to this day.

163
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:15,360
Because I was so very touched
by feelings I had never felt.

164
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:23,430
I have grown miserable with my yearning
for you. When everyone goes to sleep...

165
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,330
No.

166
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,860
I will call for you when I am available.

167
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,400
I was overwhelmed by my feelings.
I exceeded my limits.

168
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,100
Please forgive me. With your permission.

169
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,200
My dear Esma.

170
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,430
Poor girl.

171
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,930
My Bey? I found an caravansary on the way.

172
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,430
-Is it far away?
-Not very far, my Bey.

173
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,860
We will spend the night at the caravansary.

174
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,520
I will think it thorough.

175
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:10,100
You are very tired, my Bey.
You know better but you should rest a bit.

176
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,400
Come on.

177
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:40,060
I am guessing that the little prince will
be more collaborative than his father.

178
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,560
A glance into someone’s eyes is enough
for me to understand their essence...

179
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:47,130
...and I’m never mistaken, dear Petruccio.

180
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:50,530
It is great that he found
a friend inside the castle.

181
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:55,160
The more people he likes from us,
the easier our job will be.

182
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,930
The chests can stay here, Marcus.

183
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:18,500
Make sure that everything is ready
before the monks arrive.

184
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,860
They will be more trustful
when they see the gold.

185
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,830
-We wouldn't want to be embarrassed.
-As you wish, sir!

186
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:12,530
How are you, my beautiful niece?

187
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,400
I am fine, uncle.

188
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:19,130
I am hanging out with the most handsome
man in the castle, how could I not be?

189
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,800
How are you, your highness prince?

190
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,260
I am not a prince.

191
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,860
I am a Seljuk Shahzada.

192
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,160
You are right, my Shahzada.

193
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,940
But we can have some
mispronunciations like that here.

194
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,340
Please accept my apologies.

195
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,900
Isadora.

196
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:55,130
You were a cute little girl
the last time I saw you.

197
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,100
But now...

198
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,030
...you have turned into
a very beautiful young lady.

199
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:04,030
It’s an eye-brightening sea change.

200
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,680
Unfortunately I could not remember you,
your highness Cardinal.

201
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,220
So, you have seen my before.

202
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,140
Beautiful Isadora.

203
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:19,830
The last time I saw you, you were holding
the hand of my dear friend Giovanni.

204
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:58,030
I will get rid of Sahabeddin.
Then Ertugrul can be yours, Titus.

205
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,330
Wasn't that so?

206
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,560
Nasir?

207
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:08,200
I don't have time for this,
come to the point.

208
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:12,160
-Is there a new order from Ustad?
-Yes.

209
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:36,930
Ustad wants us to start the main attack.

210
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:39,560
When you run after the big glory...

211
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:43,000
...the things you left unfinished
will get in your way.

212
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,360
If you are talking about
Sahabeddin and Ertugrul...

213
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,960
...they cannot even peek out
from the hole they are in.

214
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:54,160
Do you think that Ertugrul won’t hunt down
the fake witnesses...

215
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,230
...that you made speak up in the court one by one?

216
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,600
My men are in all the streets of Aleppo.

217
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,800
We will catch Ertugrul even if he shows us
only his shadow.

218
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:07,900
El Aziz is in our pockets at the moment.

219
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:11,800
Even if all those witnesses
came together...

220
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,460
...his highness the Ameer
would still believe us.

221
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:18,260
After all, I am his only savior.

222
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,800
And Aftalia is his dear Esma.

223
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:29,860
Nasir, Nasir, Nasir.

224
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:35,220
The way you speak reminds me of Kara Toygar.

225
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:41,440
I hope that you won’t end up like him.

226
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,720
God is the Greatest, God is the Greatest

227
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:17,720
God is the Greatest, God is the Greatest

228
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:30,260
I bear witness that there is no god
except the One God

229
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:43,080
Fie! Fie! Fie! King’s justice!
We want King’s justice!

230
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,720
Don’t do that. It’s a shame.

231
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,160
We want King’s justice. Don’t do that.

232
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,120
We want King’s justice.

233
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,940
Fie! Fie! Fie!

234
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,440
Fie! Fie! Fie!

235
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,040
Don't do that!

236
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,700
Fie! Fie! Fie!

237
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:24,240
This is a place where the
invocation of God rises.

238
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:28,600
The dervishes think that you don’t show
the utmost respectable behaviur to this place.

239
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:37,000
What do the dervishes think about
a traitor who collaborates with infidels?

240
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,230
His highness the Ameer believes
that the traitors are hiding in here.

241
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:43,560
Don’t stay in the way while searching for them...

242
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,130
...in that way we won’t use force.

243
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,430
Let them in.

244
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,600
If you’re sincere, you are more than welcome...

245
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:23,530
...but if you are malevolent, turn back and leave.

246
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,500
-My Pir...
-Tell me the grandson of my Pir.

247
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:55,230
Commander Nasir came.

248
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,400
Some people saved
your dear son Sahabeddin.

249
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:05,140
And our son El Aziz believed what he
had been whispered in his ears...

250
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,800
...and sent Nasir here.
-Is that so?

251
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,230
A child in Andalus, took some wheat...

252
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,360
...to a non-Muslim millwright with his uncle.

253
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:48,020
They were supposed to give him 100 okes of wheat
and take 90 okes of flour.

254
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:52,480
And the miller was
a cheater on the scales.

255
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,600
He weighed 80 okes and filled a sack with it.

256
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,960
The uncle of the boy wanted
what was his right.

257
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,260
“What kind of a man are you?” he said.

258
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,000
They started arguing.

259
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:12,030
Then the argument turned into a fight.

260
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,900
The child didn't know what to do.

261
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:19,860
His uncle and the millwright
kept fighting each other.

262
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,900
The sacks got burst...

263
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,100
...and they were both covered
in flour from head to toe.

264
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:32,600
The child went and took a piece of stick
and stood in front of them.

265
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:37,560
Which one is infidel,
which one is my uncle?

266
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:41,860
Which one is infidel,
which one is my uncle?

267
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,530
Which one is infidel...

268
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,530
God sees the fate of his servant
by his appearance.

269
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:34,930
Many say they are Muslims but their hearts
say the opposite...

270
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,600
...and many say they are believers
but their hearts say the opposite.

271
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:41,900
As our Almighty God speaks
in Surah Al-Baqara.

272
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:47,000
These are the people who have purchased
error at the price of guidance...

273
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,640
...but their profit is priceless...

274
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:54,960
...and they are not guided.”

275
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:10,600
Ertugrul Bey was right.
This guy called Nasir is like a rabid dog.

276
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:14,060
We need to take sister Halime
and the Shahzada out of here.

277
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,600
That would be the best for them
and for the people in the lodge.

278
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,600
Peace be upon you.

279
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,100
Peace be upon you.

280
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,800
Peace be upon you.

281
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,530
May it be easy on you, Gundogdu.

282
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,980
Do not tire Selcan Hatun too much.
She carries two lives...

283
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,680
...and the voyage is hard as it is.

284
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,400
Is it your job to think about our baby?

285
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,130
Of course, we think about our nephew.

286
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:31,060
Our blood will flow in the future
generations thanks to Gundogdu.

287
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:36,330
I may not see our nephew become a Bey,
as I am an old man but...

288
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:42,600
What kind of a game
are you playing now, Kurdoglu?

289
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,130
My dear son...

290
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:48,430
...I don't know how
you came to despise me so much.

291
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,360
Yes, I did say some words to you as well,
while my blood brother was ill...

292
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:58,330
...for the unity and future of our tribe.
I even resented some of your words and...

293
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:00,860
...replied in an unbefitting way.

294
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,680
But you mean a lot to me, Gundogdu,
you know that.

295
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,360
It is your turn to become
the Bey of the tribe.

296
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,840
I want this from the bottom of my heart.

297
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:15,680
Besides, I’m just grinning and bearing it
of your youngness.

298
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,420
Here you are.

299
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,260
This honey is rare to find.

300
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,030
Our girl Selcan should eat it and get stronger...

301
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:32,060
...so that our nephew is strong too.

302
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:39,560
Thank you, uncle.

303
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,230
What a two-faced man, this Kurdoglu is!

304
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,460
Peace be upon you.

305
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,460
And peace be upon you.

306
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:34,860
Our daughter Halime is in good hands
at the palace now, Numan Effendi.

307
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:38,900
Now it’s time to pray and reliance
so that she recovers soon.

308
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,960
You are right.

309
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,130
But...

310
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,300
...when the palace is
in turmoil like this...

311
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:52,830
...leaving her and coming here
was not easy.

312
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:00,600
Maybe it’s the first time that
we are not together since her birth.

313
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:05,060
That is not the only problem.

314
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,300
Yigit.

315
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,120
God who separated your paths today
will of course...

316
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,820
...get you together again
when the time comes.

317
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,180
Do not worry.

318
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,100
If you find it appropriate too...

319
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:27,400
...I would like to go to the palace
with your greetings...

320
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,960
...and ask your sister to see my daughter.

321
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,860
Of course.

322
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:14,060
Welcome, venerable Father Daniel.

323
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,530
Your highness...

324
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:48,260
...the famous trader I told you about,
Abu Hisam awaits to be accepted by you.

325
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,600
Tell him to come in.

326
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:12,500
Is what Nasir told me true, Abu Hisam?

327
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:17,600
Do you want to undertake all our trade
in the Mediterranean region for us?

328
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:21,230
Yes, your highness, I do.

329
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:26,060
Why should I give you such a privilege?

330
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:32,830
Give me the supervision of all the
vendible products...

331
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
...all trade ships and caravans...

332
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:39,330
...and I will double the gold in your treasury.

333
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:42,830
That is my promise, your highness.

334
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:45,460
What do you say, Nasir?

335
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,460
Can we trust Abu Hisam?

336
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:55,860
Of course, your highness. He is one of
the most honest people in this world.

337
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,300
I also do trust the man that you trust, Nasir.

338
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:15,860
Then all the cores of the trades life of Aleppo...

339
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,000
...is in your hands now, Abu Hisham.

340
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:56,100
Where is the Shahzada?

341
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,260
Where is Halime, Dogan?

342
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:03,560
You were right, my Bey.

343
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:07,000
Nasir came with some of his men
to look for us in the lodge.

344
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:10,800
Nasir came out of the lodge empty handed
as well as us.

345
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:13,430
What are you saying, Dogan. Speak clearly.

346
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,500
Do you mean that Halime and
her father ran away?

347
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,400
No, Bey. But...

348
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,060
...while we were away,
sister Halime's wound got worse.

349
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:27,480
The people in the lodge found a contact
from the palace and brought the physician.

350
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,960
Come to the point.

351
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:32,920
My Bey...

352
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:34,900
...Halime Sultan...

353
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,300
...is in the palace.
