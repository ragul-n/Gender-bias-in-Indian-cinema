00:02:59,993 --> 00:03:03,258
Come on l am not dressed that bad

4
00:03:04,731 --> 00:03:06,096
Navin, you could have made an effort

5
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:07,360
l am making an effort!

6
00:03:07,434 --> 00:03:08,901

you here, haven't it?

7
00:03:08,969 --> 00:03:11,164
Oh

8
00:03:20,947 --> 00:03:22,676
Come on Nandini

9
00:03:22,749 --> 00:03:23,875

See?

14
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,479
You are so insincere!

15
00:03:56,483 --> 00:03:59,247
Sorry Nandini... l said l am sorry

16
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:01,446
No you're not. You're
only saying sorry because...

17
00:04:01,521 --> 00:04:03,045
...you feel you should say that

18
00:04:04,858 --> 00:04:09,386
lsn't that the reason why
people say sorry, please, thank you

19
00:04:09,462 --> 00:04:12,761
No Navin, people say sorry
because they are feeling sorry

20
00:04:13,967 --> 00:04:16,060
Well, now l am really sorry

21
00:04:16,136 --> 00:04:17,228
What is that supposed to mean?

22
00:04:18,138 --> 00:04:20,868
Come on Nandini, l am not
dressed that badly am l?

23
00:04:21,074 --> 00:04:24,202
You're okay Navin l mean

00:04:24,277 --> 00:04:26,973
l am wearing a dress, my hair is

25
00:04:27,047 --> 00:04:28,241
Look at your shoes...

26
00:04:30,984 --> 00:04:32,076

27
00:04:33,086 --> 00:04:35,020
Well!... you said
look at me... so...

28
00:04:36,456 --> 00:04:37,821
Do you know how
many people are there?

29
00:04:38,191 --> 00:04:39,283
How many?

30
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,822
Fifty

31
00:04:42,062 --> 00:04:43,154
Fifty

32
00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:45,561
All my cousins are here... and
they are dying to meet you...

33
00:04:45,799 --> 00:04:48,461
What will they say -What?

34
00:04:48,935 --> 00:04:50,869
That this is the man
l am going to marry

35
00:04:51,805 --> 00:04:53,397
Well Nandini, this is the
man you are going to marry

36
00:04:55,976 --> 00:04:57,568
You could have worn the blue shirt

37
00:04:58,411 --> 00:04:59,503
Which blue shirt?

38
00:04:59,913 --> 00:05:02,882
The cotton one. The one l got from
Calcutta. The one you never wear.

39
00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:04,416
Oh! You mean the green shirt

40
00:05:05,285 --> 00:05:06,411
lt's blue!

41
00:05:06,486 --> 00:05:07,953
No Nandini it's green

42
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:09,921
Don't make me mad Navin it's blue!

43
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:12,981
Okay! lt's blue-green...

44
00:05:16,062 --> 00:05:18,223

45
00:05:22,435 --> 00:05:24,494
Shit!
-All right guys... listen up!

Finally going for our
long overdue honeymoon

51
00:05:36,016 --> 00:05:37,278

55
00:05:43,223 --> 00:05:44,315
Tanu, baby...

Me! l'll try yoga, otherwise

57
00:05:48,061 --> 00:05:49,926
You don't need it...
- Fatso? ...

58
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,357
Never mind...

59
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:54,590
Will indulge in
some serious drinking

60
00:05:54,968 --> 00:05:56,993
Me? No fairness creams please

61
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,438
What about you Yash?
- l'll be good

62
00:06:01,975 --> 00:06:03,033
Nandini?

63
00:06:04,277 --> 00:06:05,335
No more marriages.

64
00:06:05,912 --> 00:06:07,140
No one will get married this year

65
00:06:07,213 --> 00:06:10,410
That means - a whole lot of
happy people, wow! Sorry Tanu

66
00:06:10,483 --> 00:06:11,950
Lifetime resolution...

67
00:06:14,354 --> 00:06:15,548

68
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,557
Think again pal... ow!

70
00:06:42,248 --> 00:06:43,306

Happy new year

72
00:07:17,117 --> 00:07:18,448
Do you want to dance?

73
00:07:19,719 --> 00:07:22,017
Me? No... no

74
00:07:22,422 --> 00:07:25,220
She sure looks happy...
what about you?

75
00:07:25,558 --> 00:07:27,423
Well!... l'm happy...
but a little scared

76
00:07:28,094 --> 00:07:31,586
Why are you men so clichÃ©d?
-Why? Can't men be scared?

77
00:07:31,664 --> 00:07:33,222
So, have you thought
about my wedding gift?

78
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,566
Hmm... l was thinking...

79
00:07:35,635 --> 00:07:39,401
No, don't tell me! lt's
supposed to be a surprise

80
00:07:39,472 --> 00:07:40,962
Then why did you propose to her?

81
00:07:41,441 --> 00:07:45,571
Well! Firstly... l love her,
secondly... l love her madly...

82
00:07:46,946 --> 00:07:48,072
And finally... l am
a little drunk, Tanu

83
00:07:48,148 --> 00:07:52,175
Do a formal portrait of Navin and
me...l promise l'll be surprised

84
00:07:52,385 --> 00:07:53,443
Good idea

85
00:08:25,485 --> 00:08:27,112
Fatso! Let's dance

86
00:08:27,187 --> 00:08:30,384
No, no... l don't want to...
- my stomach is hurting

87
00:08:30,456 --> 00:08:32,287
Good
- lets do some belly dancing!

88
00:08:38,231 --> 00:08:40,791
Yash baby, this is Amar.
He works in my office

89
00:08:41,568 --> 00:08:44,196
Yash
- and... Sudeep... he can't dance...

90
00:08:49,475 --> 00:08:50,567
Okay, that's your last drink now

91
00:08:50,643 --> 00:08:51,701
Yes, last drink

92
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,181
That is how you have to dance, baby

93
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,091
l am not feeling well.

94
00:09:09,696 --> 00:09:11,095
Now this is cheating

95
00:09:12,632 --> 00:09:14,497
Yash! Why did you have to do that?

96
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:16,592
Do what?
-Why did you force him to dance?

97
00:09:16,669 --> 00:09:18,261
ljust want everyone
to have a good time

98
00:09:18,338 --> 00:09:20,602
Good time! Does it look
like he is having a good time?

99
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:24,040
You're such a loser

100
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:27,837
Shit!

101
00:09:51,437 --> 00:09:52,699
All well?

102
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:56,133
Don't l look like the
happiest human being alive?

103
00:09:58,278 --> 00:10:02,772
Cigarette please... all well?

104
00:10:03,049 --> 00:10:05,916
Doesn't he look like the
happiest human being alive?

105
00:10:07,921 --> 00:10:09,115
Tanuja bashed you up?

106
00:10:10,356 --> 00:10:12,017
ljust don't understand girls?

107
00:10:12,692 --> 00:10:17,857
l tease Sudeep, he doesn't mind,
but Tanuja gets mad

108
00:10:17,931 --> 00:10:18,989
Even l get mad. Okay?

109
00:10:19,065 --> 00:10:21,932
Football! l'll give
you one hard kick!

110
00:10:25,738 --> 00:10:27,205
Tanuja is upset with you...

111
00:10:27,273 --> 00:10:30,003
because you're not taking the
relationship to the next level

112
00:10:30,076 --> 00:10:32,306
lt's not a videogame! Next level!

113
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:35,006
l don't want to do that
- okay - l am not ready for it

114
00:10:40,987 --> 00:10:42,079
Congrats

115
00:10:44,724 --> 00:10:45,816
Let's go dance

116
00:10:53,032 --> 00:10:54,294
He is going to propose to you, soon

117
00:10:54,534 --> 00:10:55,796
What?...

118
00:10:56,336 --> 00:10:58,896
He is just really drunk
- Careful Navin... let's go home

119
00:11:03,142 --> 00:11:06,236
okay, that's very nice, come on now!

120
00:11:06,312 --> 00:11:09,975
Take out the car... l am coming...

121
00:11:11,184 --> 00:11:12,776
Ahey! Navin... Navin!

122
00:11:12,852 --> 00:11:15,377
Don't worry. l am okay...

123
00:11:18,558 --> 00:11:19,820
You idiot...

124
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,426
That's the shallow end,
Anybody can swim in that

125
00:11:23,496 --> 00:11:25,225
You idiot, your wedding gift is wet
- Navin!

126
00:11:26,432 --> 00:11:27,763
Navin!

127
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,066
What are you doing?

128
00:12:10,676 --> 00:12:12,234
Trying to rememberyour face...

129
00:12:14,147 --> 00:12:16,377
So that l know it's you...
even with my eyes closed...

130
00:12:30,296 --> 00:12:31,490
Tanuja was saying...

131
00:12:32,231 --> 00:12:34,256
Marriage changes everything...

132
00:12:35,334 --> 00:12:36,426
Will you change?

133
00:12:39,772 --> 00:12:40,864
l don't know...

134
00:12:42,842 --> 00:12:44,070
Do you want me to change?

135
00:12:46,946 --> 00:12:48,038
l don't know

136
00:12:48,448 --> 00:12:49,506
You don't know?

137
00:12:49,749 --> 00:12:50,841
Maybe just a little

138
00:12:52,185 --> 00:12:54,050
How little is little?

139
00:12:58,891 --> 00:13:00,188
Come on... hurry!

140
00:13:02,428 --> 00:13:03,520
Okay l'm going...

142
00:13:12,105 --> 00:13:13,163
Nandini...

143
00:13:13,439 --> 00:13:14,531
Yes mom?

144
00:13:14,774 --> 00:13:15,968
Call for you

145
00:13:16,209 --> 00:13:17,267
Who is it?

146
00:13:17,343 --> 00:13:18,776
lt's Navin, who else?...

147
00:13:20,012 --> 00:13:22,310
Go! What are you doing?

148
00:13:22,849 --> 00:13:23,975
l am missing you...

149
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,222
lt's a very nice store

150
00:13:38,297 --> 00:13:39,389
Just two minutes babe

151
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,297
Where do you think you are going?

152
00:13:42,535 --> 00:13:45,504
l want to see
- See it when she wears it

153
00:13:45,571 --> 00:13:48,233
Nandini l'll help you select -No,
thanks - l'll help myself

154
00:13:48,474 --> 00:13:50,135
But what if l don't like it?

155
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:54,075
Navin - l know you too well,
You'll like anything...

156
00:13:54,147 --> 00:13:55,478
As long as l am taking it off

157
00:13:56,215 --> 00:13:58,945
That's right -but black
- black with lace

158
00:13:59,018 --> 00:14:00,280
Navin! Everybody is looking

159
00:14:00,853 --> 00:14:02,343
So what? She is going to be my wife.

160
00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:04,784
You're so shameless

161
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,219
l'll find out what she bought...

162
00:14:09,428 --> 00:14:12,261
But how will l know what you bought?

163
00:14:13,866 --> 00:14:14,958
Okay
- l'll ask Yash

164
00:14:20,973 --> 00:14:23,203
Fatso, why don't you
buy some underwear?

165
00:14:23,376 --> 00:14:24,468
l don't wear any

166
00:14:24,544 --> 00:14:26,136
Freedom of movement, eh?

167
00:14:26,212 --> 00:14:29,613
Listen everybody! - He's got
nothing underneath- he is a commando

168
00:14:31,184 --> 00:14:32,276
Yash... careful
- Tanuja

169
00:14:32,351 --> 00:14:33,511
Sorry
- l didn't say anything...

170
00:14:34,954 --> 00:14:36,046
What are you laughing at?

171
00:14:43,396 --> 00:14:45,296
Hey! Navin, you forgot this

172
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,460
He forgot the essentials

173
00:14:48,701 --> 00:14:49,861
And you remembered...

174
00:14:50,937 --> 00:14:51,995
Are you leaving?

175
00:14:53,139 --> 00:14:55,300
There's nobody home
- Hurry up!

176
00:14:55,374 --> 00:14:56,932
Their goodbye goes on forever...

177
00:14:57,877 --> 00:15:00,710
Guys, change of plans...
l'll see you later

178
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,275
Okaythen, lover boy!

179

So when is your mom coming back?

180
00:15:06,085 --> 00:15:07,143
Stop worrying

181
00:15:08,254 --> 00:15:11,280
Ahhh! Have you put on
some weight? -Shut up!

182
00:15:11,524 --> 00:15:12,752
lt must be the shopping bags

183
00:15:13,359 --> 00:15:14,951
Don't you want to see what l got?

184
00:15:15,861 --> 00:15:16,953
l am just dying to...

185
00:15:17,496 --> 00:15:18,986
What if you don't like the colour?

186
00:15:19,332 --> 00:15:21,960
Then... you can wearthe
blue one l got you from Calcutta

187
00:15:22,501 --> 00:15:23,763
The green one!

188
00:15:24,103 --> 00:15:25,195
Okay blue-green

189
00:15:28,441 --> 00:15:29,772
Dad can you answer my phone?

190
00:15:34,847 --> 00:15:35,905
Who is it?

191
00:15:35,982 --> 00:15:37,745
Yash and Sudeep. They
are waiting downstairs

192
00:15:37,817 --> 00:15:38,909
Ask them to come up

193
00:15:39,518 --> 00:15:42,487
Yash why don't you come up?...
- okay

194
00:15:47,326 --> 00:15:48,759
They are waiting in the car

195
00:15:48,995 --> 00:15:51,225
Didn't you call them up?

196
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:54,160
l did, but they
preferred to wait downstairs...

197
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,435
l'm sure they must be smoking...

198
00:15:57,903 --> 00:15:58,995
Dad!

199
00:15:59,071 --> 00:16:04,839
lts fine with me! Smoke if you must
- But Why hide it?

200
00:16:05,111 --> 00:16:08,444
You explain it to them
when you see them next

201
00:16:09,015 --> 00:16:10,107
Dad, my phone please

202
00:16:12,551 --> 00:16:13,813
Good luck to you

203
00:16:13,886 --> 00:16:16,218
Thanks dad... l might get late

204
00:16:16,289 --> 00:16:17,381
Navin,

205
00:16:20,259 --> 00:16:22,420
l hope you don't smoke on the sly

206
00:16:22,828 --> 00:16:26,320
Dad! l have nothing to hide. Bye

207
00:16:39,845 --> 00:16:40,903
What?

208
00:16:41,847 --> 00:16:43,075
You're one lucky bastard!

209
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,276
Yes, l'm lucky

210
00:16:46,152 --> 00:16:49,087
You don't deserve
a girl like Nandini

211
00:16:49,288 --> 00:16:50,380
l know that

212
00:16:50,723 --> 00:16:52,782
But do you know where we are going?

213
00:16:53,025 --> 00:16:54,993
Takes three hours from Bombay.

214
00:16:55,061 --> 00:16:58,155
Buddy once l shift here,
it's bye bye-bye Bombay

215
00:16:59,031 --> 00:17:00,157
Navin...

216
00:17:00,232 --> 00:17:01,722
Where will you stay after marriage?

217
00:17:01,801 --> 00:17:04,065
At home, with dad... he'll be alone

218
00:17:05,471 --> 00:17:07,962
Maybe we'll move
out after a while...

219
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,071
Nandini may not get along with him

220
00:17:10,509 --> 00:17:13,137
Shut up! Nandini gets
along fine with uncle...

221
00:17:13,713 --> 00:17:17,240
lt's you who keeps
fighting with him!

222
00:17:17,783 --> 00:17:18,875
Whoa! Me?

223
00:17:20,086 --> 00:17:21,519
He just gets on my nerves...

224
00:17:22,722 --> 00:17:24,849
Forget it...You are lucky,
you don't have a father

225
00:17:25,224 --> 00:17:26,316
Don't say that

226
00:17:26,525 --> 00:17:29,255
Hey fatso! Have you
ever slept with a girl?

227
00:17:30,229 --> 00:17:31,321
Yes...

228
00:17:31,864 --> 00:17:34,025
Yes?... Who was it?

229
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:38,264
Rita
- Rita? Senorita? Liar!

230
00:17:38,838 --> 00:17:41,102
No no, it's the truth He
slept with Rita Senorita...

231
00:17:41,507 --> 00:17:44,305
and snored all night long

232
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:49,004
Sudeep seriously, why
don't you get married?

233
00:17:49,181 --> 00:17:50,910
Haven't found anyone... like me

234
00:17:50,983 --> 00:17:53,781
lts difficult
-to find an all-rounder like him!

235
00:17:53,953 --> 00:17:56,046
Yash
- l'll punch you out of the car

236
00:17:59,925 --> 00:18:01,119
l have found that someone...

237
00:18:02,228 --> 00:18:03,786
Someone who loves me for who l am...

238
00:18:05,865 --> 00:18:07,196
l'm in love...

239
00:18:07,266 --> 00:18:08,756
He's in love

240
00:18:30,556 --> 00:18:31,818
You are bleeding

241
00:18:33,058 --> 00:18:34,286
Ah! You okay?

242
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,989
Yes... think so... you?
-Yes l am okay

243
00:18:38,864 --> 00:18:41,332
Fatso?...
- Sudeep... Fuck!Sudeep.

244
00:19:05,524 --> 00:19:07,151
Sudeep, get up... Sudeep...

245
00:19:08,427 --> 00:19:09,519
Fatso get up...

246
00:19:12,631 --> 00:19:14,428
Fatso

00:19:19,271 --> 00:19:22,604
Fatso get up... fatso...Get up...

248
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:26,440
Sudeep, get up...

249
00:19:32,918 --> 00:19:34,146
You scared the shit
out of us... idiot!

250
00:20:31,744 --> 00:20:33,769
Where is he, Navin?
- l don't think you should go in

251
00:20:33,846 --> 00:20:34,938
Where is he, Yash?

252
00:20:35,881 --> 00:20:37,007
l.n there...

253
00:21:15,854 --> 00:21:16,912
Bite it,

254
00:21:18,223 --> 00:21:19,383
Bite it damn it!

255
00:21:49,221 --> 00:21:51,280
Come on come on let's go...

256
00:21:53,659 --> 00:21:54,751
No point looking back now.

257
00:21:55,661 --> 00:21:56,889
This is the final destination

258
00:22:01,066 --> 00:22:03,762
Dead? What do you mean dead?

259
00:22:04,003 --> 00:22:05,095
Thank you, bye-bye, ta-ta

260
00:22:05,838 --> 00:22:07,066
l can't be dead man!

261
00:22:07,139 --> 00:22:09,266
Why can't you be dead?
-Are you Superman?

262
00:22:14,346 --> 00:22:16,371
There were two other people with me
- They Are still alive

263
00:22:16,749 --> 00:22:19,343
They still have time
-yourtime was up- So, here you Are

264
00:22:21,787 --> 00:22:23,277
l was supposed to get married...

265
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:30,021
So? l've had to get people in
the middle of their wedding night

266
00:22:30,863 --> 00:22:33,832
lmagine that! How awkward is that!
But l still do it... duty is duty

267
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,258
But how can l...?...

268
00:22:42,408 --> 00:22:44,968
Fresh delivery... just died...
post-death depression

269
00:22:45,044 --> 00:22:46,443
Take him for counseling

270
00:22:47,112 --> 00:22:48,977
You don't worry. You
are beyond worries now

271
00:22:49,048 --> 00:22:50,777
l am dead and you are
asking me to not worry

272
00:22:50,849 --> 00:22:54,444
But your case is straightforward
- death by accident

273
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,988
This fellow here is
a suicide bomber...

274
00:22:57,656 --> 00:22:59,886
The suicide counter sends
him to the accident counter

275
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:03,416
...and the accident counter
says it is a case of suicide

276
00:23:04,563 --> 00:23:07,088
This boy, he had an
affair with a married woman...

277
00:23:07,566 --> 00:23:08,658
Her husband came
home early one day...

278
00:23:08,734 --> 00:23:11,726
He froze in the refrigerator...
and came straight up here!

279
00:23:12,071 --> 00:23:13,163
These ladies...

280
00:23:13,238 --> 00:23:18,175
were on their way to a pilgrimage,
their bus overturned...

281
00:23:27,219 --> 00:23:28,447
Now what?

282
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,613
Network is busy
There is no network here

283
00:23:31,957 --> 00:23:33,618
They promised that the
network always follows

284
00:23:33,692 --> 00:23:34,852
Nevertrust people

285
00:23:51,176 --> 00:23:53,644
What is the big hurry? There
is nowhere to go to from here

286
00:23:57,716 --> 00:23:58,774
Welcome sir, welcome

287
00:24:05,491 --> 00:24:06,549
Now it'll get done!

288
00:24:08,093 --> 00:24:09,185
Come here

289
00:24:09,561 --> 00:24:10,789
Have you been smoking again? -why?

290
00:24:11,029 --> 00:24:12,121
ldiot! You've brought the wrong man

291
00:24:12,564 --> 00:24:14,691
He is not the one? -No!

292
00:24:14,867 --> 00:24:16,698
You always get me into trouble

293
00:24:17,069 --> 00:24:18,161
ls there a problem?

294
00:24:18,237 --> 00:24:21,536
No problem at all... a
minor printing mistake...

295
00:24:21,807 --> 00:24:23,672
Hey! Don't blame
me for your fuck ups

296
00:24:24,009 --> 00:24:26,239
l told you not to
do drugs on duty...

297
00:24:26,945 --> 00:24:28,037
l've stopped that

298
00:24:28,113 --> 00:24:29,740
Tell me what has happened

299
00:24:29,815 --> 00:24:30,873
A minor problem... lt'll be okay...

300
00:24:30,949 --> 00:24:32,940
Not this time. l am
telling you, this is a big mess

301
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:35,578
But what is it? Will
somebody please tell me?

302
00:24:37,156 --> 00:24:40,819
l'll tell you. He fucked up!
Got the wrong guy!

303
00:24:42,895 --> 00:24:46,023
You mean, l was not
supposed to die? -That's right

304
00:24:46,532 --> 00:24:47,658
He made a mistake?

305
00:24:47,733 --> 00:24:48,859
Exactly! His mistake...
Might as well own up...

306
00:24:51,036 --> 00:24:52,970
Bastard! l am going to kill
you -What... what are you doing?

307
00:24:57,242 --> 00:24:58,300
What... what are you doing?...

308
00:24:58,377 --> 00:25:00,072
Anybody can make a mistake

309
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:03,179
Mistakes! You can't
make mistakes with my life

310
00:25:06,318 --> 00:25:08,718
There is a 0.001%
margin for human error

311
00:25:09,054 --> 00:25:10,681
Human error? But you are not human

312
00:25:10,756 --> 00:25:11,814
And this is no error!

313
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:13,585
He has a point

314
00:25:13,659 --> 00:25:15,627
What? We... we are not human? - No,
we are not humans... not anymore

315
00:25:15,694 --> 00:25:17,161
Then... l am sorry
- Ok just shut up!

316
00:25:18,931 --> 00:25:20,398
Listen! You have to send me back

317
00:25:20,632 --> 00:25:24,090
Sir, we would like to... but
we don't have the authority

318
00:25:24,169 --> 00:25:25,693
Then who has the authority?
- Our boss, once he signs...

319
00:25:25,771 --> 00:25:27,261
...we'll send you
back-Where is your boss?

320
00:25:27,339 --> 00:25:29,739
He'll be here...
- He's in a meeting...

321
00:25:29,808 --> 00:25:31,241
Now that you are here,
why don't you relax a bit?

322
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,607
Take him to the air
conditioned room...

323
00:25:34,213 --> 00:25:37,273
With him, no way! He might
take me to a wrong place again...

324
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:40,141
Somnath... Take sir
to the waiting room

325
00:26:13,018 --> 00:26:14,110
ls everything okay?

326
00:26:15,254 --> 00:26:16,414
Yes... why don't you come inside?

327
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:19,182
-l'm fine here

328
00:26:19,892 --> 00:26:21,826
Yash, everybody is inside

329
00:26:22,127 --> 00:26:23,389
They are performing
the last rites now

330
00:26:23,762 --> 00:26:24,854
l am not a priest...

331
00:26:27,866 --> 00:26:29,197
What's the problem, Yash?

332
00:26:30,202 --> 00:26:32,432
How is me standing
outside over here a problem?

333
00:26:33,505 --> 00:26:34,972
What will l do inside?

334
00:26:35,374 --> 00:26:37,774
Sit with uncle -Yes,
and tell him what?

335
00:26:38,043 --> 00:26:40,238
Uncle don't worry.
lt's going to be all right

336
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,070
Nothing's ever going to be all right

337
00:26:46,151 --> 00:26:48,210
What do l do inside? What do l say?

338
00:26:49,554 --> 00:26:53,320
You don't have to say anything...
just be there... come

339
00:27:25,057 --> 00:27:27,082
Come home sometimes...

340
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:28,217
l'll come... for sure...

341
00:27:33,131 --> 00:27:34,257
You are idiots! Both of you!

342
00:27:36,635 --> 00:27:37,897
Sir please have yourtea...

343
00:27:38,337 --> 00:27:41,568
Sir l'm not interested in tea.
Please do something

344
00:27:41,907 --> 00:27:45,399
l am, didn't you see?
l shouted at them...

345
00:27:46,178 --> 00:27:47,839
But how is that
going to help my case?

346
00:27:49,081 --> 00:27:50,378
l admit we made a mistake

347
00:27:50,449 --> 00:27:53,043
But it is our mistake, why
are you punishing the tea?

348
00:27:54,619 --> 00:27:57,486
Sir, l'm not here to party

349
00:27:59,224 --> 00:28:01,021
l know...l know

350
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,120
ln fact, l'm not supposed
to be here

351
00:28:03,195 --> 00:28:05,425
Your case has become a
little complicated...

352
00:28:06,431 --> 00:28:09,025
ln fact, very complicated

353
00:28:12,537 --> 00:28:13,595
Please come straight to the point

354
00:28:13,939 --> 00:28:16,339
You see, as per Hindu rituals,

355
00:28:16,675 --> 00:28:18,472
your body has been cremated

356
00:28:21,213 --> 00:28:23,113
There is nothing left...
except ashes

357
00:28:25,417 --> 00:28:27,476
Now how do l send you back?

358
00:28:27,619 --> 00:28:28,916
What the fuck!

359
00:28:29,521 --> 00:28:33,685
Please!... Refrain from using such
language. Your case could get worse

360
00:28:34,192 --> 00:28:36,422
l told you to send me back!
My body was there, then

361
00:28:36,495 --> 00:28:39,396
But the boss wasn't there...
-Hey Gupta! Don't confuse him

362
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,626
lt's all your bloody fault

363
00:28:42,701 --> 00:28:43,998
Don't raise your voice.

364
00:28:44,069 --> 00:28:45,127
Do you know who l am?

365
00:28:45,203 --> 00:28:48,070
Who are you- some big shot?
l will make your life hell

366
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,370
.lt is already hell...
that is why l'm sitting here

367
00:28:50,442 --> 00:28:52,034
Just shut up!... Shut up!

368
00:28:53,578 --> 00:28:56,206
What kind of man are you?
Can't you admit your mistake?

369
00:28:56,415 --> 00:28:57,939
Didn't anybody
teach you to say sorry?

370
00:28:59,151 --> 00:29:01,619
Sorry... - See! He said sorry...
sir said sorry

371
00:29:01,686 --> 00:29:03,244
And l... l already said sorry to you

372
00:29:03,321 --> 00:29:04,379
And l'm anyway sorry

373
00:29:05,657 --> 00:29:09,184
Listen... please
send me back... now!

374
00:29:09,594 --> 00:29:11,027
That's what l want to do...

375
00:29:11,363 --> 00:29:13,228
But this decision is
not in my hands...

376
00:29:13,432 --> 00:29:16,924
Only the GM can decide... l am
also answerable to my superiors

377
00:29:17,502 --> 00:29:18,594
And where is the GM?

378
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:20,968
ln a meeting... he
is waiting for you

379
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,438
What the fuck!.

380
00:29:38,256 --> 00:29:39,348
Poor Navin...

381
00:29:41,693 --> 00:29:42,819
Why is he the poor guy?

382
00:29:43,295 --> 00:29:45,490
He is dead... He
doesn't feel anything...

383
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:49,425
We are the poor souls,
the ones left behind...

384
00:29:50,168 --> 00:29:51,328
l mean, look at his dad

385
00:29:51,837 --> 00:29:52,929
And what about Nandini?

386
00:29:54,239 --> 00:29:55,763
She has her whole life before her...

387
00:29:56,741 --> 00:29:57,867
How's she doing?

388
00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:13,985

390
00:30:19,264 --> 00:30:22,529
Nandini, Please eat something

391
00:30:51,763 --> 00:30:52,889
Who's Anna?

392
00:30:53,365 --> 00:30:55,526
Anna is one hot chick

393
00:30:59,137 --> 00:31:01,105
She's passionate...

394
00:31:01,339 --> 00:31:03,398
desirable... and lovely

395
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:06,307
A bit like me actually

396
00:31:06,511 --> 00:31:10,845
Ok! Nice to meet you,
Ms Nandini Karelina.

397
00:31:11,183 --> 00:31:12,343
lt's Karenina

398
00:31:12,551 --> 00:31:13,779

Karelina -Karenina

403
00:31:37,542 --> 00:31:38,975
Okay, so when did you die?

404
00:31:39,044 --> 00:31:40,341
Madam it was the year 1975...

405
00:31:46,218 --> 00:31:47,617
And who all were with you?

406
00:31:48,153 --> 00:31:50,053
These three were there
with me. We died together

407
00:31:50,288 --> 00:31:51,414
l have to be sure of the count

408
00:31:51,489 --> 00:31:54,925
ls the GM there?
-Yes, But where Are you going?

409
00:31:55,126 --> 00:31:56,184
l have to meet him.
lt'll take two minutes

410
00:31:56,261 --> 00:31:58,092
Go stand in the line
- l have been waiting forever...

411
00:31:58,163 --> 00:32:01,860
Navin-ji, you can't go inside
You don't have an appointment

412
00:32:09,941 --> 00:32:11,636
Take him out of here. Throw him out

413
00:32:12,644 --> 00:32:14,271
Tell me something...

414
00:32:15,146 --> 00:32:16,545
ls this heaven or hell?

415
00:32:17,015 --> 00:32:18,107
There is no heaven,
no helllt is sheer

416
00:32:18,183 --> 00:32:19,844
propaganda... to keep people in line

417
00:32:20,218 --> 00:32:22,243
Once you come here,
a bit of paperwork,

418
00:32:22,554 --> 00:32:26,957
Then your file is
closed and you are free

419
00:32:27,259 --> 00:32:28,351
What do you mean, free?

420
00:32:28,426 --> 00:32:31,259
You are free of desires
-fear-free of hunger, thirst...

421
00:32:31,529 --> 00:32:33,520
...love, hatred, anger... everything

422
00:32:33,898 --> 00:32:36,662
All you do is walk in beautiful
garden That is what l've heard

423
00:32:37,302 --> 00:32:39,202
So, you've never
been there yourself?

424
00:32:39,271 --> 00:32:42,672
No, we are volunteers
- stuck here at the last station

425
00:32:43,041 --> 00:32:44,099
Still stuck to our desires

426
00:32:44,342 --> 00:32:45,934
Give me some tea
-What Are you doing here?

427
00:32:46,678 --> 00:32:47,940

428
00:32:58,423 --> 00:33:00,448
Are you still angry with me?

429
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:08,228
l know l have done you wrong

430
00:33:11,069 --> 00:33:14,163
l can't do much to make up... but...

431
00:33:17,309 --> 00:33:19,300
l can take you back there...
for a while

432
00:33:20,378 --> 00:33:21,504
Really?

433
00:33:22,013 --> 00:33:23,537
Tell me
-when, when when?

434
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:28,076
Don't shout. Once my shift is over

435
00:33:29,321 --> 00:33:30,379
But only for some time, okay?

436
00:33:33,491 --> 00:33:36,119
Watch her form a distance,
not too close, okay?

437
00:34:54,806 --> 00:34:56,706
Hi,sorry we are late

438
00:34:57,809 --> 00:34:59,970
What took you so long?
- l was with them

439
00:35:00,044 --> 00:35:02,512
Tanuja changed three times!

440
00:35:09,154 --> 00:35:11,418
This is Nandini...- Can you reduce
the air-conditioning a bit please?

441
00:35:11,489 --> 00:35:12,956
Yeah, l don't know why
it's so cold in here

442
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,184
...and take the food
order quick please

443
00:35:14,259 --> 00:35:15,351
...otherwise my friend will die!

444
00:35:17,862 --> 00:35:19,989
Can l have a Carbonara?
With extra Oregano.

445
00:35:20,064 --> 00:35:21,531

-too fattening!

446
00:35:26,571 --> 00:35:28,766
She is happy!

447
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,905
What pasta will you use? -Spaghetti

448
00:35:31,843 --> 00:35:33,037
No, fettucini

449
00:35:37,415 --> 00:35:39,440
l told you, it wasn't a
good idea to come here

450
00:35:42,454 --> 00:35:45,514
l am dead... and all she
can think of- is pasta?

451
00:35:46,157 --> 00:35:50,059
Life goes on... she has moved on...
Time has stopped -only for you

452
00:35:50,595 --> 00:35:51,926
Time is a healer...

453
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:53,825
You've been dead three months

454
00:35:55,433 --> 00:35:57,401
Three months, Nandini...

455
00:35:58,136 --> 00:36:01,902
That's it? You have forgotten me?

456
00:36:04,409 --> 00:36:06,138
How can you do this to me?

457
00:36:06,611 --> 00:36:10,411
Answer me Nandini. Come on,
l deserve an answer at least

458
00:36:11,883 --> 00:36:13,043
l'll just be back

459
00:36:13,218 --> 00:36:14,515
Nandini are you okay, babe?

460
00:36:15,453 --> 00:36:16,920
Where are you going now? Nandini!

461
00:36:19,123 --> 00:36:20,215
She's looking down?

462
00:36:20,959 --> 00:36:22,051
Nandini,

463
00:36:23,428 --> 00:36:25,259
l said l want to grow old with you

464
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:27,127
Do you think that's
some kind of bullshit?

465
00:36:27,532 --> 00:36:29,124
Maybe for you but not for me!

466
00:36:30,435 --> 00:36:32,835
You know what all l'm
going through, up there?

467
00:36:33,371 --> 00:36:34,599
Just trying to come back

468
00:36:35,473 --> 00:36:37,941
lt's not easy, but l am
fighting with every one

469
00:36:38,009 --> 00:36:39,101
Trying to come back

470
00:36:39,477 --> 00:36:41,104
But to what? To whom?

471
00:36:42,881 --> 00:36:44,280
Come on Nandini, please...

472
00:36:44,349 --> 00:36:46,840
Everytime l say something to you,
you start going into a sulk

473
00:36:47,285 --> 00:36:49,378
Come on just... just
say what you have to say

474
00:36:50,355 --> 00:36:53,518
l can't go on like
this Navin... l can't

475
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:59,187
Everybody says you are dead,
but you are not dead for me

476
00:37:03,968 --> 00:37:06,061
l have to forget you...
if l have to live

477
00:37:11,643 --> 00:37:14,874
Hey. What's the matter Nandini?

478
00:37:15,046 --> 00:37:16,104
Nothing... just something in my eye

479
00:37:23,021 --> 00:37:25,546
You know what, l
can't take it anymore

480
00:37:26,157 --> 00:37:29,058
Same here buddy -You are right.
She is still sad...

481
00:37:29,994 --> 00:37:31,086
We should do something about it

482
00:37:31,663 --> 00:37:32,925
Don't worry pal. l'm coming back

483
00:37:32,997 --> 00:37:35,090
Fatso, can you keep a secret?

484
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:36,992
What?

485
00:37:40,038 --> 00:37:41,266
l am breaking up with Tanuja

486
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,902
What are you saying Yash?-Shit, man!

487
00:37:45,143 --> 00:37:47,839
She will be shattered -And
l'm going to tell her...

488
00:37:49,247 --> 00:37:50,509
Tell her what?

489
00:37:51,015 --> 00:37:52,141
That l love her

490
00:37:53,918 --> 00:37:55,852
But if you love her, why
are you breaking up with her?

491
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,319
l'm breaking up with Tanuja.

492
00:37:58,556 --> 00:37:59,784
l'm in love with Nandini

493
00:38:00,992 --> 00:38:02,050
What?

494
00:38:02,961 --> 00:38:05,088
Don't give me that look.
lt's not a crime

495
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:07,156
You son of a...

496
00:38:07,231 --> 00:38:08,994
And l'm not a son of a bitch
- in case you were thinking that!

497
00:38:09,067 --> 00:38:10,125
Come on, let's go

498
00:38:10,201 --> 00:38:12,669
l've always loved her.
Even when Navin was alive

499
00:38:13,605 --> 00:38:14,663
Snake!

500
00:38:14,739 --> 00:38:16,866
lt's not right,
Yash... -Then what is right?

501
00:38:17,308 --> 00:38:21,574
That l marry Tanuja and keep
loving Nandini... ls that right?

502
00:38:22,614 --> 00:38:25,811
Orthat Nandini should
live unhappily ever after?

503
00:38:27,986 --> 00:38:29,044
ls that right?

504
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,246
Sock him Sudeep!

505
00:38:30,722 --> 00:38:31,882
l guess you are right

506
00:38:31,956 --> 00:38:34,049
What kind of a friend are you?
-Come, lets go-they'll sort it out

507
00:38:37,095 --> 00:38:38,858
Here... here they
come -Don't say a word

508
00:38:41,933 --> 00:38:43,696
Where were you all for so long?

509
00:38:44,936 --> 00:38:46,597
The food hasn't arrived yet?-No...

510
00:38:46,938 --> 00:38:50,704
Yash! Do something
-l'll get it... manager...

511
00:38:53,344 --> 00:38:54,868
Okay then, take care

512
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:56,171
Bye...

513
00:38:58,016 --> 00:39:00,041
Take care
- if you need anything call me

514
00:39:19,404 --> 00:39:21,736
Come on Navin, time to go...
come on now...

515
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,732
This is a real mess

516
00:39:23,808 --> 00:39:26,174
But how did this happen?

517
00:39:27,412 --> 00:39:28,777
This is a real mess. Answer me!

518
00:39:28,846 --> 00:39:30,006
l admit there has
been a mistake sir,...

519
00:39:30,081 --> 00:39:31,343
...but the overall
dead-count is still correct

520
00:39:31,416 --> 00:39:32,781
This is wrong, absolutely wrong.

521
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:34,875
Send him back, immediately
- Okay?

522
00:39:35,219 --> 00:39:36,982
But sir, his body
has been cremated...

523
00:39:37,822 --> 00:39:40,791
l know his body is not there...
Who is that other fellow?... Sudeep

524
00:39:40,858 --> 00:39:43,418
Evict him from his body
and allot it to Navin, okay?

525
00:39:43,661 --> 00:39:45,026
What do you mean?
Allot his body to me!

526
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:48,927
See, your friend Sudeep...
he was the one supposed to die

527
00:39:49,133 --> 00:39:52,227
So we will bring him here, and
you can go there... into his body

528
00:39:52,303 --> 00:39:53,861
No way man. l am not Sudeep!

529
00:39:53,938 --> 00:39:57,169
Of course you are not Sudeep You
will only be dwelling in his body

530
00:39:57,742 --> 00:39:59,369
Yes, but who will they see,
when they look at me?

531
00:39:59,444 --> 00:40:02,413
Sudeep! But you'll know
that you are Navin not Sudeep

532
00:40:02,647 --> 00:40:04,808
Big help! Listen, l don't
want somebody else's body

533
00:40:04,882 --> 00:40:06,213
l want my own god damn body, okay?

534
00:40:06,284 --> 00:40:07,342
But your body is not there

535
00:40:07,719 --> 00:40:09,118
So make a new one

536
00:40:09,353 --> 00:40:12,117
lf one loses a passport,
you get a duplicate

537
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:15,921
But your body is not lost,
its expired... burnt!

538
00:40:15,993 --> 00:40:17,688
And sir, there is no
precedent for such a case

539
00:40:17,762 --> 00:40:19,787
Yes, duplication
is a crime over here

540
00:40:19,864 --> 00:40:20,922
Then do something else

541
00:40:20,998 --> 00:40:22,431
Do what? We are not God

542
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,960
Then call him. Where the hell is he?

543
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:28,398
Sorry! No idea.
Everybody says there is God

544
00:40:28,473 --> 00:40:29,906
But where is he? Nobody knows that

545
00:40:29,974 --> 00:40:31,134
Sir please try and understand

546
00:40:31,309 --> 00:40:36,110
l'm here and my best
friend is seducing my Nandini

547
00:40:37,081 --> 00:40:38,912
How do you know that?...
How does he know that?

548
00:40:38,983 --> 00:40:40,109
How can he know that?

549
00:40:42,253 --> 00:40:43,720
There must be some link
- otherwise how would he know?

550
00:40:43,788 --> 00:40:45,187
He must have some link
- Sir it's not important

551
00:40:45,256 --> 00:40:46,314
He was always in love with her...

552
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:48,858
l always knew that
- l'm just trying to help you

553
00:40:49,193 --> 00:40:51,286
You can go back, but only
in Sudeep's body, that's all

554
00:40:54,265 --> 00:40:55,391
ls there no other option, sir?

555
00:40:55,466 --> 00:40:58,492
Of course there is an option.
You can stay here... forever

556
00:41:01,973 --> 00:41:03,838
l need to go back
- l know, you need to go back...

557
00:41:03,908 --> 00:41:05,739
You can go back, but only as Sudeep

558
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:07,937
You think over it
my boy... and decide

559
00:41:13,251 --> 00:41:15,151
Navin, listen to me... don't say no

560
00:41:15,553 --> 00:41:16,611
Nobody ever gets a
chance to go back from here...

561
00:41:16,687 --> 00:41:18,678
...but you are getting it
- shut up man!Have you seen Sudeep?

562
00:41:18,756 --> 00:41:19,814
Yes... He is fat, so?

563
00:41:19,891 --> 00:41:22,121
That is not such a bad
thing He is fat, but cute...

564
00:41:22,794 --> 00:41:24,261
How much time has
passed since l last saw her?

565
00:41:24,495 --> 00:41:25,621
Two weeks

566
00:41:26,764 --> 00:41:27,856
Two weeks!

567
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:33,095
Vijay, l have to see Nandini.
Please... take me down

568
00:41:33,171 --> 00:41:34,502
Are you crazy?

569
00:41:34,572 --> 00:41:37,063
l can't take you every time...
just because you feel like it

570
00:41:37,608 --> 00:41:38,836
Bastard! lt is all your fault

571
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:41,970
So? But l can't
take you there again.

572
00:41:42,113 --> 00:41:43,205
You almost spilt the beans

573
00:41:44,782 --> 00:41:47,580
l haven't yet, but l will... if
you don't take me to her. Right now!

574
00:41:47,652 --> 00:41:50,018
Mind... mind your hands. l
just got my shirt ironed

575
00:41:51,789 --> 00:41:53,279
l am in deep shit... and
you're worried about your shirt

576
00:41:54,091 --> 00:41:56,685
Don't be ungrateful, man!
What kind of a man are you?

577
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:07,968
Ah! Great smell... its my favourite

578
00:42:12,143 --> 00:42:13,337
Hmm... l love this

579
00:42:17,882 --> 00:42:18,974
What's the matter?

580
00:42:25,289 --> 00:42:28,781
You should've warned me
-Why is it So cold suddenly?

581
00:42:29,727 --> 00:42:32,321
This is your girl... -Yes

582
00:42:32,563 --> 00:42:34,861
She is pretty. Very nice

583
00:42:37,235 --> 00:42:40,102
She is an amazing girl.
Loves me a lot

584
00:42:41,172 --> 00:42:42,662
Loves you... or... loved you?

585
00:42:43,374 --> 00:42:44,932
Loves me... still does!

586
00:42:45,009 --> 00:42:47,739
Whateveryou say... And
this is your fast friend...

587
00:42:49,914 --> 00:42:51,006
He is very fast

588
00:42:58,389 --> 00:43:01,654
Have some shame Yash.
Think of Tanuja, at least

589
00:43:01,726 --> 00:43:03,057
Calm down... calm down

590
00:43:07,465 --> 00:43:08,557
After all you were
all close friends...

591
00:43:14,705 --> 00:43:15,933
After all you were
all close friends...

592
00:43:16,974 --> 00:43:18,134
This is not unusual...
amongst friends

593
00:43:18,376 --> 00:43:19,638
Will you shut up?

594
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:20,868
Don't get angry

595
00:43:24,382 --> 00:43:25,440
Now this is crossing boundries...

596
00:43:25,616 --> 00:43:27,106
Bastard! Take your hands off her

597
00:43:28,419 --> 00:43:29,545
And you keep your hands off me.

598
00:43:31,656 --> 00:43:32,782
.lts all because of you

599
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:37,120
Why blame me? Look
at your girlfriend.

600
00:43:37,662 --> 00:43:39,391
She is the one who
is encouraging him...

601
00:43:39,664 --> 00:43:41,564
What did you say about Nandini?
-Can't you see?

602
00:43:44,535 --> 00:43:45,661
What are you thinking?

603
00:43:46,103 --> 00:43:49,072
Nothing! l'm just
missing Navin a lot today.

604
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,671
You know it's been four months and
everybody says time will heal...

605
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:56,136
But l don't want to be
healed -Yes, l miss him too

606
00:43:58,449 --> 00:43:59,609
l wish he was here right now

607
00:44:03,487 --> 00:44:04,977
He was such a
calming presence in my life

608
00:44:12,196 --> 00:44:16,826
Mr Navin, are you sure?
-Yes Sir, very sure

609
00:44:17,969 --> 00:44:20,233
This is your chance
to eternal freedom.

610
00:44:20,638 --> 00:44:22,196
There, you will be
a slave to feelings

611
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,635
Let me be enjoy being a slave for
a while... then you can set me free

00:44:24,875 --> 00:44:25,967
As you wish.

613
00:44:26,043 --> 00:44:29,103
Krishna... Let him

614
00:44:35,953 --> 00:44:38,615
This is your No Claims form?
-Yes... its a little detailed

615
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:43,883
Won't you read it? -l'll

00:45:03,614 --> 00:45:05,605
See you soon -l hope not too soon...

621
00:45:06,484 --> 00:45:08,111
What about his gate pass?
-Sir, l will take care... Come on

622
00:45:26,804 --> 00:45:31,138
Why did you go out on your moped?
Why can't you take a cab?

623
00:45:32,009 --> 00:45:33,101
You don't get a cab in this weather

624
00:45:33,177 --> 00:45:36,806
You are drenched to the bone...
Go change -Everything is wet...

625
00:45:51,062 --> 00:45:52,154
What is for dinner?

626
00:45:52,229 --> 00:45:53,321
The usual...

627
00:45:54,732 --> 00:45:57,633
You promised to make steak
-l'll make it tomorrow... promise

628

629
00:46:02,973 --> 00:46:07,171
He has no idea!
Making all these plans...

630
00:46:07,344 --> 00:46:09,175
Now you'll have to
fulfill all his plans

631
00:46:10,548 --> 00:46:11,640
And he'll have to fulfill mine

632
00:46:23,828 --> 00:46:24,886
He is my friend...

633
00:46:28,132 --> 00:46:29,190

634
00:46:30,801 --> 00:46:32,860
Listen... any tips for me?

When will my time be up? -No,
no... no tips at all

636
00:46:38,609 --> 00:46:40,099
But you'd know, for sure

637
00:46:40,811 --> 00:46:42,938
Yes, l know... but you shouldn't.

638
00:46:43,013 --> 00:46:44,207
...Sometimes it is
good to not know things...

639
00:46:45,749 --> 00:46:49,685
Okay bye...and best
of luck -Thanks Vijay

640
00:46:52,957 --> 00:46:55,619

There wasn't a moment

00:50:10,637 --> 00:50:18,339
There wasn't a
moment l lived without you

Have you told her?

680
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:28,708

00:51:37,724 --> 00:51:39,089
Hi Nandini

689
00:52:13,593 --> 00:52:15,288
Come sit

690
00:52:15,561 --> 00:52:17,119
Sudeep?

691
00:52:22,702 --> 00:52:24,567
So, what's the plan? -What plan?

692
00:52:24,971 --> 00:52:27,531
Sudeep said he wanted to meet me

693
00:52:28,041 --> 00:52:30,305
Then you want to take me out...

694
00:52:30,576 --> 00:52:32,043
What are you two hatching?

695
00:52:32,211 --> 00:52:33,473

Good... but will
you go out like this?

702
00:52:49,729 --> 00:52:52,664
You look like a tramp?

703
00:52:58,004 --> 00:52:59,266
Thank you

704
00:53:00,039 --> 00:53:02,007
You two are doing so much for her

705
00:53:02,542 --> 00:53:03,668
When she's alone -

706
00:53:03,743 --> 00:53:06,678
Aunty don't worry,

707
00:53:06,979 --> 00:53:08,241
l'm here now...

708
00:53:12,752 --> 00:53:15,186
As long as you all are around,
l'm not worried

709
00:53:15,254 --> 00:53:18,621
Aunty you'll never have
to worry about Nandini

710
00:53:18,858 --> 00:53:20,257
l'm here now

711
00:53:29,902 --> 00:53:33,167
So ... what is the big surprise?

712
00:53:33,239 --> 00:53:35,207
There's no surprise
-Shall l tell her?

713
00:53:35,274 --> 00:53:37,208
lt's just dinner,
what's there to tell

714
00:53:37,276 --> 00:53:39,176
-l See, have you proposed?

715
00:53:39,645 --> 00:53:41,977
What? - No, he's going to,

716
00:53:42,048 --> 00:53:43,811
Don't talk rot

717
00:53:45,785 --> 00:53:47,946
...that's the best piece of
news l've heard in a long time

718
00:53:50,123 --> 00:53:52,921
Does Tanuja know?

719
00:53:52,992 --> 00:53:54,653
-No, she's waiting in the restaurant

720
00:53:55,194 --> 00:53:58,254
Did you tell her?
-Yes, l sent her a message

721
00:53:58,598 --> 00:54:00,122
So... she's coming -Yeah

722
00:54:03,803 --> 00:54:05,065
Alright guys, change of plans...

723
00:54:05,371 --> 00:54:06,633
-What happened?

724
00:54:06,706 --> 00:54:07,866
Dinner at my place

725
00:54:08,107 --> 00:54:09,369
-But Tanuja
- she's waiting there...

726
00:54:09,609 --> 00:54:11,099
l'll tell her

727
00:54:12,378 --> 00:54:14,812
Don't worry. l've texted her

728
00:54:17,416 --> 00:54:18,940
That's the delivery report

729
00:54:26,826 --> 00:54:29,886
Nandini please go in. We
have something to discuss

730
00:54:29,996 --> 00:54:31,156
Discuss what?

731
00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:33,130
lt's part of the surprise. You go in

732
00:54:33,399 --> 00:54:35,060
We'll be right back

733
00:54:37,003 --> 00:54:39,733
Hippo, what do you
think you are doing?

734
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:41,864
l'm doing the right thing

735
00:54:41,941 --> 00:54:43,932
-Why did you call Tanuja here?

736
00:54:44,777 --> 00:54:47,439
Why? She's also a friend

737
00:54:49,081 --> 00:54:51,208
She has a right to know
what's going on -Shut up.

738
00:54:51,350 --> 00:54:52,749
l'm not doing anything wrong

739
00:54:52,819 --> 00:54:53,877
So why are you hiding it from her?

740
00:54:53,953 --> 00:54:56,217
-Because there is a
time for everything

741
00:54:56,289 --> 00:54:58,223
Are you guys done yet?

742
00:54:58,858 --> 00:54:59,950
-Yes we Are

743
00:55:00,092 --> 00:55:01,889
No, we're not -Yes we are

744
00:55:02,228 --> 00:55:03,786
Okay we are.

745
00:55:04,897 --> 00:55:05,989
Now we are done

746
00:55:07,099 --> 00:55:08,862
What's going on

747
00:55:12,672 --> 00:55:14,003
-Yash open the bloody door

748
00:55:16,876 --> 00:55:21,040
Yash
- open the bloody door! Nandini!

749
00:55:28,754 --> 00:55:30,722
Hi Tanuja!
- Hi Sudeep

750
00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:32,551
Hi Tanuja

751
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:35,554
-Yash, Tanuja is here!

752
00:55:35,795 --> 00:55:37,490
What's happened?

753
00:55:37,563 --> 00:55:38,928
He's locked me out -Why?

754
00:55:38,998 --> 00:55:40,727
He's giving Nandini a surprise

755
00:55:44,437 --> 00:55:45,699
-But Why Are you outside?

756
00:55:45,838 --> 00:55:47,305
Hi Nandini

757
00:55:51,644 --> 00:55:52,736
Where are you going?

758
00:55:52,812 --> 00:55:53,938
l have to leave

759
00:55:54,413 --> 00:55:56,347
ls everything alright? -l'm fine

760
00:56:02,388 --> 00:56:05,357
What's going on guys?
- l'll go check on her

761
00:56:05,725 --> 00:56:10,560
-What's going on Yash?- She's finding
it very hard to deal with life

762
00:56:15,034 --> 00:56:16,365
So how was your day?

763
00:56:21,374 --> 00:56:22,534
Nandin...

764
00:56:25,378 --> 00:56:26,538
...you don't want to talk?

765
00:56:39,725 --> 00:56:44,719
Please feel free to smoke.

766
00:56:45,665 --> 00:56:47,360
l used to tell Navin...

767
00:56:48,501 --> 00:56:49,900
but l think he nevertold you

768
00:56:51,737 --> 00:56:54,137
No he did not

769
00:56:58,744 --> 00:57:05,775
You know...when Navin was a
boy he used to cling to me

770
00:57:06,485 --> 00:57:09,420
Wouldn't let go of me;
even slept with me...

771
00:57:11,057 --> 00:57:13,753
Then suddenly he grew up

772
00:57:14,593 --> 00:57:16,788
...and we stopped
talking to each other

773
00:57:17,997 --> 00:57:20,727
l tried very hard to tell him

774
00:57:21,567 --> 00:57:23,125
how much l...

775
00:57:26,172 --> 00:57:28,697
but ljust couldn't

776
00:57:32,411 --> 00:57:34,003
He loved you too

777
00:57:35,448 --> 00:57:37,973
He couldn't tell you... but l know

778
00:57:39,151 --> 00:57:42,712
l know. After all, he was my son.

779
00:57:46,425 --> 00:57:47,517
May l...

780
00:57:52,732 --> 00:57:54,165
Can l...?

781
00:58:00,539 --> 00:58:01,733
l'm going to set everything right

782
00:58:02,008 --> 00:58:03,942
l'll stop eating
and start exercising

783
00:58:04,477 --> 00:58:06,468
l hearthis from
you every few months

784
00:58:06,712 --> 00:58:08,839
Relax, nothing is going to change

785
00:58:10,049 --> 00:58:13,109
Sorry l didn't mean
to discourage you but

786
00:58:13,352 --> 00:58:14,819
just be happy the way you are

787
00:58:15,588 --> 00:58:18,819
But how can l? This
body is so bloody fat

788
00:58:18,891 --> 00:58:21,359
ls this any age to have sugar?

789
00:58:21,594 --> 00:58:25,496
You have sugar?-No...
Yes... l mean...

790
00:58:25,564 --> 00:58:27,464
lf l continue this way, the
doctor says l will have sugar

791
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:29,527
That's not good at all

792
00:58:29,668 --> 00:58:32,068
l know but l don't have sugar,
or anything else

793
00:58:32,138 --> 00:58:34,470
l'm fit and fine

794
00:58:34,974 --> 00:58:36,703
So are you dropping the gym idea?

795
00:58:37,543 --> 00:58:38,805
No way, sweetheart.

796
00:58:39,712 --> 00:58:42,078
Things are going to change
-for good

797
00:58:53,492 --> 00:58:56,984
Mmm...Are you sure?

798
00:58:57,830 --> 00:58:58,888
-Hundred percent

799
00:59:01,734 --> 00:59:03,531
You were never fond of pasta...

800
00:59:05,438 --> 00:59:06,928
ln fact you were
nevertoo fond of ltalian

801
00:59:07,673 --> 00:59:08,901
lt was Navin's favourite

802
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:15,976
Come to think of it, we never
had ltalian. We always had Thai

803
00:59:16,749 --> 00:59:18,080
Because that was your favourite

804
00:59:19,819 --> 00:59:23,949
Navin loved coffee and pasta,
and old Hollywood films

805
00:59:26,926 --> 00:59:28,791
More than anything else,
he loved you

806
00:59:34,633 --> 00:59:36,624
Cheer up, life is not overyet

807
00:59:39,038 --> 00:59:40,562
Unfortunately not

808
00:59:41,574 --> 00:59:44,042
Don't say that
- Navin wouldn't have liked it

809
00:59:45,044 --> 00:59:46,636
Can we talk of something else?

810
00:59:55,488 --> 00:59:57,922
You were very upset last night...

811
01:00:00,993 --> 01:00:03,188
lf you don't want to talk...

812
01:00:03,796 --> 01:00:05,764
-No, everything's fine

813
01:00:06,532 --> 01:00:07,897
No it isn't...

814
01:00:08,868 --> 01:00:11,564
Yash was behaving so strangely

815
01:00:13,539 --> 01:00:14,767
What did he say to you?

816
01:00:16,008 --> 01:00:18,203
Nothing... He was just being mad

817
01:00:19,512 --> 01:00:21,480
l know what he must have told you

818
01:00:21,914 --> 01:00:23,779
And for having said that, he is mad

819
01:00:23,849 --> 01:00:25,111
-he was making sense

820
01:00:25,484 --> 01:00:27,884
Sense? How can you just get
up one day and start saying...

821
01:00:27,953 --> 01:00:30,717
Sudeep, there's nothing to
be shocked about. lt's okay

822
01:00:30,789 --> 01:00:33,121
Okay? lt's okay?

823
01:00:34,226 --> 01:00:36,023
That means you too...

824
01:00:36,095 --> 01:00:38,996
No silly, he's my friend,
just like you are

825
01:00:39,165 --> 01:00:42,657
And l'm so fond of you,
can't be in love with you

826
01:00:43,235 --> 01:00:46,500
you are my buddy but l

827
01:00:46,572 --> 01:00:48,836
Not in a thousand
years you know what l mean?

828
01:00:55,247 --> 01:00:57,909
Hello

829
01:01:00,286 --> 01:01:01,583
What do you think you're doing?

830
01:01:02,054 --> 01:01:04,989
You are not Naveen. You are Sudeep

831
01:01:05,191 --> 01:01:08,683
You're fine the way you are-Shut up

832
01:01:08,761 --> 01:01:10,661
What is your problem?

833
01:01:12,598 --> 01:01:13,860
l'm sorry

834
01:01:21,674 --> 01:01:26,873
Mom, l'm thinking of writing a
story. lt's a little strange.

835
01:01:27,713 --> 01:01:28,805
There's a boy-

836
01:01:28,881 --> 01:01:31,714
he's madly in love with a girl

837
01:01:31,917 --> 01:01:34,818
He dies... but he
was not supposed to...

838
01:01:34,887 --> 01:01:37,651
-Who's the murderer? - lt's a
love story. You won't understand

839
01:01:37,723 --> 01:01:40,783
-Fine, so don't tell me

840
01:01:40,859 --> 01:01:41,917
The boy dies

841
01:01:41,994 --> 01:01:43,461
When he reaches heaven...

842
01:01:43,529 --> 01:01:45,053
He finds out that
there's been a mistake

843
01:01:45,497 --> 01:01:47,761
Someone else was supposed to die

844
01:01:47,833 --> 01:01:50,461
What are you saying?
-its pretty simple

845
01:01:50,970 --> 01:01:53,063
They send this boy back to earth,

846
01:01:53,472 --> 01:01:55,940
but in the body of the
man who was supposed to die

847
01:01:56,008 --> 01:01:58,533
So it's the same boy; but now...
he's the other man

848
01:01:58,611 --> 01:02:01,842
So how will the girl know that,
THlS man is actually THAT boy?

849
01:02:01,914 --> 01:02:03,882
l can't understand a thing

850
01:02:03,949 --> 01:02:06,076
The boy is not the boy anymore.
And the man is not the man

851
01:02:06,151 --> 01:02:08,278
That's what l'm
asking Sudeep, who is who?

852
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:11,045
Look, the boy came back after
death -How is that possible?

853
01:02:11,123 --> 01:02:14,183
Mom, what about reincarnation?
How is that possible?

854
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:18,526
That is just the priests trying to
fool you. There is just one life

855
01:02:18,597 --> 01:02:20,064
Just imagine for a minute
-this is a

856
01:02:20,199 --> 01:02:22,895
This is A's body
and this is A's soul

857
01:02:24,570 --> 01:02:29,166
And this is B's body
and this is B's...

858
01:02:30,609 --> 01:02:33,544
You ate him?! You killed him!

859
01:02:34,113 --> 01:02:36,581
How could you do that? -Oh
my god, l'm so sorry Sudeep!

860
01:02:40,786 --> 01:02:44,916
Nandini, we should go on
a long drive some time

861
01:02:45,591 --> 01:02:46,922
That's a very good idea.

862
01:02:47,126 --> 01:02:51,222
We'll all go
-you, me, Tanuja. lt'll be fun

863
01:02:51,697 --> 01:02:53,756
Yes. That's not a bad idea.

864
01:02:54,667 --> 01:02:56,601
lt's been so long
since we went to Goa

865
01:02:56,769 --> 01:02:57,895
We just went there, last holidays

866
01:03:03,575 --> 01:03:04,940
You hadn't come with us...

867
01:03:05,544 --> 01:03:06,738
l didn't come with you?

868
01:03:06,812 --> 01:03:08,439
No, you had gone with
your motherto Nagpur...

869
01:03:10,349 --> 01:03:12,442
Ah, right. l really missed it.

870
01:03:13,519 --> 01:03:15,487
But you had fun...

871
01:03:15,688 --> 01:03:16,985
-That's because you were not there

872
01:03:20,659 --> 01:03:24,857
Do you remember, you almost drowned

873
01:03:26,498 --> 01:03:27,624
You told me!

874
01:03:28,067 --> 01:03:30,695
l nevertold you

875
01:03:31,403 --> 01:03:32,631
Navin must've told me then.

876
01:03:33,639 --> 01:03:36,836
The two of them went to the beach.

877
01:03:37,576 --> 01:03:38,668
lt was high tide.

878
01:03:38,911 --> 01:03:41,744
Suddenly one big wave hit Nandini...

879
01:03:41,814 --> 01:03:43,782
...and she
disappeared underthe water

880
01:03:44,717 --> 01:03:49,177
And it felt like the
longest moment of my life

881
01:03:50,122 --> 01:03:52,886
l thought - l don't know
what l'd live for... again

882
01:03:54,460 --> 01:03:56,553
Then she surfaced and l felt

883
01:03:57,830 --> 01:03:58,956
that l could breathe again

884
01:04:00,799 --> 01:04:02,767
Navin told me

885
01:04:02,835 --> 01:04:05,167
-Really? he nevertold me

886
01:04:05,537 --> 01:04:06,902
Well, he told me

887
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:09,708
-Then he must have also told you...

888
01:04:09,975 --> 01:04:12,671
How he got drunk and
made a pass at those girls

889
01:04:12,745 --> 01:04:13,803
Liar, it was you!

890
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:18,081
You asked him to chat up
the Brazilian girl -for you

891
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:19,981
That was the one
thing l hated about Navin

892
01:04:21,487 --> 01:04:22,749
He couldn't hold his drinks

893
01:04:22,921 --> 01:04:24,411
-But he promised he'd give it up-

894
01:04:24,490 --> 01:04:27,516
after marriage... and he would have

895
01:04:27,726 --> 01:04:30,820
You can't give up
smoking and drinking

896
01:04:31,430 --> 01:04:32,590
He would have done anything.

897
01:04:32,765 --> 01:04:34,027
for you Nandini

898
01:04:34,633 --> 01:04:35,793
What is the point?

899
01:04:35,868 --> 01:04:38,530
lt doesn't matter anymore

900
01:04:38,604 --> 01:04:39,730
-Yes
-what's gone is gone

901
01:04:40,539 --> 01:04:42,803
What is gone is not gone!

902
01:04:43,575 --> 01:04:45,736
lt must go somewhere

903
01:04:47,246 --> 01:04:52,878
l'm sure wherever Navin is,
he can hear, see and feel...

904
01:04:53,051 --> 01:04:55,485
Jjust like us

905
01:04:56,889 --> 01:04:58,652
And l'm sure he's
watching you Nandini

906
01:04:58,924 --> 01:05:02,087
and he's saying, ''don't be sad''

907
01:05:04,229 --> 01:05:05,526
l love you baby...

908
01:05:06,598 --> 01:05:07,895
and l'm with you

909
01:05:10,135 --> 01:05:11,659
Sudeep please stop this

910
01:05:12,838 --> 01:05:14,169
-Can't you shut up?

911
01:05:20,679 --> 01:05:22,579
Why did he have to go away, Yash?

912
01:05:27,986 --> 01:05:30,921
Why?

913
01:05:41,934 --> 01:05:43,925
Why must you talk of
Navin all the time?

914
01:05:44,870 --> 01:05:46,531
Navin is my friend

915
01:05:46,872 --> 01:05:48,203
Not is
-Was!

916
01:05:48,874 --> 01:05:52,537
And he was my friend too. But
-Was!

917
01:05:54,046 --> 01:05:55,604
Nandini is Navin's girl

918
01:05:55,681 --> 01:05:57,740
She WAS Navin's girl!

919
01:05:59,518 --> 01:06:03,921
He's dead now What do you
want herto do kill herself?

920
01:06:04,089 --> 01:06:07,923
Or keep chanting away Navin's name
- like you?

921
01:06:11,830 --> 01:06:15,789
Think of Tanuja at least.
Why are you cheating on her?

922
01:06:15,868 --> 01:06:17,699
l will tell her -When?

923
01:06:17,870 --> 01:06:19,565
When the time is right.

924
01:06:22,708 --> 01:06:25,541
When the time is right.
You leave that to me

925
01:06:28,213 --> 01:06:30,909
Navin would never do this to you

926
01:06:31,850 --> 01:06:35,581
Can you please stop
the bike Sudeep? Stop it!

927
01:06:38,957 --> 01:06:41,118
How do you know that?
Did Navin tell you?

928
01:06:42,294 --> 01:06:46,958
Yash! l'd never do this to you!

929
01:07:02,881 --> 01:07:04,143
Vijay...

930
01:07:08,921 --> 01:07:10,047
Vijay...

931
01:07:12,057 --> 01:07:13,217
...can you hear me?

932
01:07:20,866 --> 01:07:27,738
You'd said, its fine to
be fat... but it's not

933
01:07:32,044 --> 01:07:35,605
You said, l had to
fulfill Sudeep's dreams.

934
01:07:35,681 --> 01:07:37,114
But what about my dreams?

935
01:07:39,351 --> 01:07:42,286
for you there is no time
- But time is running out for me...

936
01:07:43,088 --> 01:07:46,285
Go to sleep
- do you know What time it is?

937
01:07:46,358 --> 01:07:47,757
Yes, mom

938
01:07:51,229 --> 01:07:53,060
You gave me a new life-

939
01:07:53,231 --> 01:07:58,100
but Nandini doesn't
want anyone but Navin

940
01:07:59,004 --> 01:08:02,963
And l am Sudeep to her, not Navin

941
01:08:07,913 --> 01:08:13,249
Vijay, come here and help me

942
01:08:18,890 --> 01:08:20,084
Please
- help me...

943
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:37,588
Hi Tanuja,

944
01:10:37,662 --> 01:10:38,754
l thought you were in Delhi

945
01:10:38,997 --> 01:10:41,192
Am l supposed to
be in Delhi? Oryou?

946
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:44,430
No, that got cancelled
last minute, actually...

947
01:10:44,669 --> 01:10:46,034
Do you think l'm dumb, Yash?

948
01:10:46,171 --> 01:10:47,934
-No baby, seriously.

949
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:49,930
lt was cancelled. Some
mix-up about AM PM...

950
01:10:50,008 --> 01:10:51,202
What are you talking about?

951
01:10:51,443 --> 01:10:53,468
What's going on?
- Nothing's going on baby

952
01:10:53,545 --> 01:10:54,807
-Don't touch me, you bastard

953
01:10:55,213 --> 01:10:56,475
And you?

954
01:10:56,648 --> 01:10:58,809
You think you can do whatever
you want -with whomeveryou want?

955
01:10:59,050 --> 01:11:00,984
l thought you were a friend Nandini

956
01:11:02,954 --> 01:11:04,148
Thank you Sudeep

957
01:11:05,991 --> 01:11:10,587
Yash, what's going on?

958
01:11:17,636 --> 01:11:19,934
Sudeep!

959
01:11:22,607 --> 01:11:23,801
What did you tell her?

960
01:11:23,875 --> 01:11:25,103
-just That we were watching a film

961
01:11:27,279 --> 01:11:29,110
Actually, l told her everything

962
01:11:30,081 --> 01:11:31,571
-you Are such a loser

963
01:11:34,619 --> 01:11:35,745
l'm sorry

964
01:11:36,021 --> 01:11:38,285
- No, l'm sorry that l trusted you.

965
01:11:39,658 --> 01:11:41,148
You've destroyed everything

966
01:11:58,076 --> 01:11:59,168
Are you okay?

967
01:11:59,244 --> 01:12:00,939
-Yes, l'm fine

968
01:12:01,213 --> 01:12:04,114
Just give me five
minutes please, Amar... alone

969
01:12:05,150 --> 01:12:06,310
l'll be outside

970
01:12:16,261 --> 01:12:18,729
Hi Amar... listen, is Tanuja free?

971
01:12:18,864 --> 01:12:20,195
-Yes, she's free. Go in...

972
01:12:23,301 --> 01:12:24,768
Here's something to cheeryou up

973
01:12:31,209 --> 01:12:34,076
Didn't l tell you that l should
not be disturbed for 5 minutes?

974
01:12:34,145 --> 01:12:35,976
Can't you stop people
from barging into my room?

975
01:12:36,047 --> 01:12:37,742
Can't l depend on anyone?

976
01:12:38,016 --> 01:12:40,246
-But l was just getting the... sorry

977
01:13:08,380 --> 01:13:10,143
All men are dogs
-All men?

978
01:13:12,417 --> 01:13:13,679
You got a doubt?

979
01:13:13,985 --> 01:13:16,920
-No you're right. All men are dogs

980
01:13:18,723 --> 01:13:19,815
Pathetic

981
01:13:21,993 --> 01:13:23,620
But some of us are well-trained dogs

982
01:13:25,297 --> 01:13:26,662
-Really?

983
01:13:29,634 --> 01:13:30,862
l like your sense of humour.

984
01:13:31,436 --> 01:13:32,698
And you know what?
- Shhhh!.

985
01:13:34,706 --> 01:13:38,073
Just leave Amar. Go home

986
01:13:44,716 --> 01:13:45,808
So, what's up?

987
01:13:47,852 --> 01:13:48,978
Cooking?

988
01:13:50,989 --> 01:13:53,981
-Well, l do sometimes

989
01:13:57,329 --> 01:13:58,387
Are you okay?

990
01:14:03,201 --> 01:14:07,365
l thought l would get over Tanu.

991
01:14:09,908 --> 01:14:11,307
But now l know how you feel...

992
01:14:12,911 --> 01:14:14,469
...without Navin...

993
01:14:16,181 --> 01:14:17,341
sort of...

994
01:14:18,149 --> 01:14:19,343
l went to see her

995
01:14:19,417 --> 01:14:22,477
Yes...l tried calling her...

996
01:14:24,255 --> 01:14:25,950
l'm sorry Yash -Shit.

997
01:14:26,925 --> 01:14:28,187
You know, l really screwed up

998
01:14:29,327 --> 01:14:30,692
Give her some time

999
01:14:31,896 --> 01:14:33,056
-No l mean, this...

1000
01:14:33,865 --> 01:14:35,992
l burnt the chicken

1001
01:14:37,035 --> 01:14:38,127
l can fix it if you like

1002
01:14:38,203 --> 01:14:40,364
-No, l've to fix it myself

1003
01:14:41,873 --> 01:14:42,931
So are you staying for dinner?

1004
01:14:43,008 --> 01:14:44,339
-Only if you fix it

1005
01:14:44,843 --> 01:14:46,037
l will fix it

1006
01:15:01,092 --> 01:15:02,787
Tanuja pick up the phone

1007
01:15:02,861 --> 01:15:04,829
She's not answering the phone.

1008
01:15:05,296 --> 01:15:06,729
She's locked herself inside

1009
01:15:06,798 --> 01:15:09,096
Yash and Nandini
are in the next flat

1010
01:15:12,737 --> 01:15:14,227
Tanuja what are you doing?

1011
01:15:15,874 --> 01:15:18,069
-Tanu baby please don't do this

1012
01:15:18,943 --> 01:15:21,070
Tanuja, listen. Answer me

1013
01:15:21,146 --> 01:15:24,172
She's been on the ledge
forthe last half an hour

1014
01:15:24,449 --> 01:15:27,179
She's locked the door

1015
01:15:27,419 --> 01:15:30,115
Listen, look at me sweety

1016
01:15:30,822 --> 01:15:32,756
Just open the door l'm really sorry

1017
01:15:33,224 --> 01:15:35,124
Tanu, Sudeep's here too

1018
01:15:46,905 --> 01:15:49,567
Tanuja. What do you
think you're doing?

1019
01:15:50,341 --> 01:15:51,603
-have you ever died before?

1020
01:15:51,676 --> 01:15:53,769
Do you have any experience of dying?

1021
01:15:53,845 --> 01:15:55,278
Then why are you doing this?

1022
01:15:55,346 --> 01:15:57,644
What are you talking about?
-l know what l'm saying

1023
01:15:58,116 --> 01:15:59,583
lt's a dead place Tanuja.

1024
01:15:59,784 --> 01:16:02,082
You'll get bored in two days
-What are you saying?!

1025
01:16:02,220 --> 01:16:04,154
The queues are a mile long

1026
01:16:04,355 --> 01:16:06,323
You need to fill up
forms for everything you do

1027
01:16:06,758 --> 01:16:10,057
lf you'd been to a
government office,

1028
01:16:10,228 --> 01:16:11,855
you'd know what l'm saying

1029
01:16:12,797 --> 01:16:16,130
Overthere, you
don't even get an agent

1030
01:16:17,202 --> 01:16:19,363
At least it won't
hurt anymore Sudeep

1031
01:16:19,771 --> 01:16:21,170
He'll ruin everything

1032
01:16:23,975 --> 01:16:25,135
You're running away from hurt?

1033
01:16:25,210 --> 01:16:26,973
There is no hurt there, but
there is nothing else either

1034
01:16:27,045 --> 01:16:30,378
Overthere, there is no joy
either No smiles, no laughter

1035
01:16:30,615 --> 01:16:34,847
-What is here? Heartache? Betrayal?

1036
01:16:34,919 --> 01:16:37,786
You have no idea how much
you'll miss this heartache

1037
01:16:37,989 --> 01:16:42,688
There is no sunrise,
no sunset, no popcorn,

1038
01:16:42,827 --> 01:16:43,953
no friends...

1039
01:16:44,162 --> 01:16:48,394
no popcorn, no see you tomorrow

1040
01:16:48,633 --> 01:16:49,930
There is no tomorrow.

1041
01:16:50,001 --> 01:16:51,161
There is nothing there

1042
01:16:51,236 --> 01:16:52,965
There is nothing here.

1043
01:16:53,271 --> 01:16:55,603
He fucked up everything!

1044
01:16:55,673 --> 01:16:56,901
So then punish him

1045
01:16:56,975 --> 01:17:00,877
He did you wrong
- punish him!

1046
01:17:00,945 --> 01:17:04,039
No sudeep... please don't

1047
01:17:04,115 --> 01:17:06,709
Should l drop him?

1048
01:17:07,252 --> 01:17:08,742
Sudeep, please don't

1049
01:17:08,820 --> 01:17:10,617
Are you afraid now? So are we.

1050
01:17:10,922 --> 01:17:13,356
Because we all love you
- Nobody loves me

1051
01:17:13,424 --> 01:17:15,392
We love you Tanuja

1052
01:17:15,627 --> 01:17:16,719
Will you say something - or do
l have to do all the talking?

1053
01:17:16,995 --> 01:17:19,327
l love you Tanu!
- shut up Yash

1054
01:17:20,165 --> 01:17:23,293
Say sorry to her
- -l'm sorry Tanu.

1055
01:17:23,735 --> 01:17:24,827
Please don't do this.

1056
01:17:24,969 --> 01:17:27,335
Come on Tanuja, open the door

1057
01:17:27,405 --> 01:17:29,839
Pull me up Sudeep

1058
01:17:47,759 --> 01:17:49,056
Be careful Sudeep

1059
01:18:11,082 --> 01:18:13,778
lt's not how you think it is
- -shut up

1060
01:18:16,955 --> 01:18:18,354
Do you want to be alone Tanuja?

1061
01:18:20,258 --> 01:18:22,249
Will you be okay?

1062
01:18:24,662 --> 01:18:26,289
Just get out all of you

1063
01:18:38,743 --> 01:18:40,734
Amar, where are you going?

1064
01:18:41,346 --> 01:18:43,177
At least you can stay
- sure

1065
01:18:48,186 --> 01:18:50,154
Can l get you something? -Shut up

1066
01:18:50,221 --> 01:18:51,347
Sure, sure...

1067
01:18:55,193 --> 01:18:56,751
l'm really worried about her

1068
01:18:57,028 --> 01:18:58,859
Me too -Me too

1069
01:18:58,930 --> 01:19:02,593
Don't you talk.
This is all your fault

1070
01:19:03,835 --> 01:19:05,063
l'll drop you home

1071
01:19:05,937 --> 01:19:08,838
No that's a bad idea.
You drop her home

1072
01:20:09,434 --> 01:20:12,699
Nandini l'm sorry. This
mess is all because of me

1073
01:20:14,038 --> 01:20:17,007
Yes- but it also got
resolved because of you

1074
01:20:20,745 --> 01:20:22,474
Okay, bye...

1075
01:20:52,343 --> 01:20:54,311
Sudeep! Pose

1076
01:21:20,505 --> 01:21:22,097
How much for a plate?
- 12 rupees

1077
01:21:22,173 --> 01:21:24,368
l'll give you 10 -But
l make nothing from it

1078
01:21:29,213 --> 01:21:30,942
Two rupees is not
going to shake up the world

1079
01:21:31,015 --> 01:21:34,143
What's the point of eating
street food if one can't bargain?

1080
01:21:36,654 --> 01:21:39,122
Do you want it spicy? -Very spicy
-for me

1081
01:21:39,190 --> 01:21:40,919
That will be an extra two rupees

1082
01:21:43,294 --> 01:21:46,457
l didn't know you liked
spicy food -l like everything

1083
01:21:47,498 --> 01:21:50,365
l don't want to miss out on anything

1084
01:21:51,002 --> 01:21:54,870
Come on, add more spice.
Why am l paying you more?

1085
01:21:56,908 --> 01:21:59,570
Sudeep, you've changed a lot.

1086
01:21:59,644 --> 01:22:02,044
lt's like you're another person

1087
01:22:02,346 --> 01:22:07,306
Nandini you're so right.
You've hit the nail on the head

1088
01:22:07,385 --> 01:22:09,182
l've changed a lot.

1089
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:11,217
But l have to change more things

1090
01:22:13,124 --> 01:22:15,217
Like your laugh?

1091
01:22:17,528 --> 01:22:19,291
Yes you're right

1092
01:22:19,564 --> 01:22:24,501
Don't change it please. l love it
-How can you love it? lt's so bad

1093
01:22:24,969 --> 01:22:26,266
lt's so you

1094
01:22:27,171 --> 01:22:28,365
These birds?

1095
01:22:28,439 --> 01:22:32,034
Navin gave me. l've
kept them carefully

1096
01:22:39,417 --> 01:22:43,649
Thank you for being so wise...
and such a good friend

1097
01:22:47,692 --> 01:22:51,924
The only thing l've learnt
in my life is that..

1098
01:22:51,996 --> 01:22:54,658
..you are responsible for your life

1099
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:59,061
lf you are happy its
because you want to be happy

1100
01:22:59,370 --> 01:23:02,305
And if you are sad, its
because you have chosen to be sad

1101
01:23:02,373 --> 01:23:06,605
You are exactly where you want to be
-l'm not sure l'm where l want to be

1102
01:23:06,677 --> 01:23:11,444
lf you don't choose to be happy,
happiness wont choose you

1103
01:23:51,122 --> 01:23:52,953
l want to tell you something

1104
01:23:55,626 --> 01:23:57,617
This is what l like about artists -
even their jokes are so intelligent

1105
01:23:57,695 --> 01:24:00,493
Did you always want to be an
artist? You must be good at drawing

1106
01:24:02,199 --> 01:24:05,896
My nephew is also
very good at drawing.

1107
01:24:05,970 --> 01:24:07,904
Always with a paper and pencil

1108
01:24:09,340 --> 01:24:10,432
He can draw a mouse.

1109
01:24:10,508 --> 01:24:13,705
He draws an M, then
an L and makes a mouse

1110
01:24:14,145 --> 01:24:15,305
He is also very funny

1111
01:24:15,379 --> 01:24:18,075
Hey Yash, have you seen Sudeep?

1112
01:24:21,285 --> 01:24:24,277
l set myself a deadline.
lt always works

1113
01:24:32,563 --> 01:24:34,053
ls that how you painted me?

1114
01:24:36,634 --> 01:24:40,035
No. Your case is different

1115
01:24:40,404 --> 01:24:43,567
Why?
- -Because you Are different

1116
01:24:44,542 --> 01:24:46,635
That's why my portrait took so long?

1117
01:24:46,711 --> 01:24:50,408
l had to wait...
because l couldn't see you

1118
01:24:58,055 --> 01:25:02,082
So l closed my eyes
and held my breath.

1119
01:25:04,395 --> 01:25:06,124
Then you began to appear

1120
01:25:07,465 --> 01:25:11,697
Closer... closer...

1121
01:25:13,204 --> 01:25:20,303
Until you were so close
that l could touch you

1122
01:25:24,248 --> 01:25:26,182
That's when l knew it was you

1123
01:25:31,355 --> 01:25:33,050
Can you tell it's me?

1124
01:25:42,099 --> 01:25:44,226
What are you doing? -What?

1125
01:25:45,569 --> 01:25:48,231
You just kissed me!
-Yes, l kissed you Sudeeps

1126
01:25:49,206 --> 01:25:52,903
Kissed me... or...?

1127
01:25:52,977 --> 01:25:58,347
ls something wrong? -No,
lt's alright.

1128
01:25:58,582 --> 01:26:02,211
ljust need some time
Just give me a minute

1129
01:26:09,326 --> 01:26:12,386
Tanuja, ljust wanted to
talk to you for a minute

1130
01:26:12,630 --> 01:26:13,961
What about?

1131
01:26:16,801 --> 01:26:20,703
l wanted to say l'm
sorry -Sorry! For what?

1132
01:26:22,973 --> 01:26:25,908
See Yash, you still don't
know what you are sorry for

1133
01:26:25,976 --> 01:26:30,140
Please stop lying to
me -l'm not lying...

1134
01:26:30,214 --> 01:26:32,114
Don't you believe in
forgive and forget?

1135
01:26:32,183 --> 01:26:34,117
l believe in
forgetting and moving on

1136
01:26:39,724 --> 01:26:41,191
Hi Tanuja.

1137
01:26:44,361 --> 01:26:46,386
l don't know what
you're so upset about

1138
01:26:46,630 --> 01:26:49,360
You know me, l'd
never do such a thing

1139
01:26:54,105 --> 01:26:56,039
Anyway l have to tell you something

1140
01:26:57,775 --> 01:26:58,969

1141
01:27:01,979 --> 01:27:05,176
There is someone in my life -Who?

1142
01:27:06,217 --> 01:27:10,347
.Sudeep -No! How did it happen?

1143
01:27:10,421 --> 01:27:12,946
lt just did
- and it feels right

1144
01:27:13,023 --> 01:27:18,051
.l hope you don't misunderstand.
-Chill... l've grown up now

1145
01:27:22,066 --> 01:27:24,193
.Listen - ljust want to
talk to you -Please, Yash!

1146
01:27:24,268 --> 01:27:26,099
Tanuja what is your problem?

1147
01:27:26,170 --> 01:27:29,037
My problem, Yash, is
that you are just a man...

1148
01:27:29,340 --> 01:27:32,070
.and you'll never
understand how a woman feels

1149
01:27:39,350 --> 01:27:44,151
You look like the happiest
human being. What happened?

1150
01:27:47,424 --> 01:27:52,088
lt's Nandini
- she kissed me

1151
01:27:53,364 --> 01:27:56,993
Congrats! Now what is your problem?

1152
01:27:59,170 --> 01:28:02,139
She kissed me Yash,
she kissed Sudeep!

1153
01:28:02,439 --> 01:28:06,933
Well, if she kissed you,
she'd kiss Sudeep not Brat Pitt

1154
01:28:09,380 --> 01:28:15,250
You don't understand. There
was Navin...and then there's this

1155
01:28:18,088 --> 01:28:19,885
She loves you idiot!

1156

You don't compare in love
-you just love...

Then please understand that
without heryou will be nothing

1160
01:28:58,429 --> 01:29:02,889

Life is still a song,

01:29:46,911 --> 01:29:50,005
lf you could give me a chance,
just a lil glance

how a woman feels, baby

1173
01:30:46,737 --> 01:30:49,706

.children playing,
the swings in a park...

1243

The evening prayer, the
air conditioning at night,

1244
