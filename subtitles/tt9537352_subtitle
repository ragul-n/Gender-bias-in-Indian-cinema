1
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:43,950
I never expected the delicate
thread of love to lead me here.

2
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:48,620
I never expected to be
bounded to be you, my dear.

3
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,570
- Give it to me, brother.
- Here.

4
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,370
Hello!

5
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:10,750
You didn't buy a
ticket today as well.

6
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,830
How does it concern you? This
bus belongs to my future in-laws.

7
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:18,280
I came in the morning, park my scooter,
get into my bus and go to college.

8
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,180
I get down there by the bus in the
evening, take my scooter and go home.

9
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,820
Then why don't you
just say that you love me?

10
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,250
Why do you keep beating
around the bush?

11
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,010
Who said that I love you?

12
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,690
There are five young
boys in your family.

13
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,210
I can love any one of them,
can't I?

14
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,500
Think about it.
Do think about it.

15
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,940
"I do what I say."

16
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:02,690
"I don't make any false promises."

17
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:07,090
"I do what I say."

18
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:10,020
"I don't make any false promises."

19
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,590
"You look like a model."

20
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:15,280
"I look like an amazing actor too."

21
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,570
"I wish to write a brilliant story
and show it on the sliver screen."

22
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:26,050
"I wish to make a movie
on our love story."

23
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:34,410
"I wish to make a movie
on our love story."

24
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,380
"We will have a few songs in it."

25
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:52,540
"We will go for drives
on the motorbike too."

26
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,540
"We will have a few songs in it."

27
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:00,350
"We will go for drives
on the motorbike too."

28
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:07,070
"I will make a brother-in-law
turn into a villain.."

29
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,630
"So that I can thrash
him in the end."

30
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:15,110
"I wish to make a
movie on our love story."

31
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:23,320
"I wish to make a
movie on our love story."

32
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:38,090
"With the right attitude,
I will kill it."

33
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:42,810
"In the other one
I will be Guggu Gill."

34
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:45,660
"With the right attitude,
I will kill it."

35
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:49,690
"In the other one
I will be Guggu Gill."

36
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:52,470
"You get a beautiful
dress stitched.."

37
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,650
"You get a beautiful
dress stitched.."

38
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:58,490
"I plan to get the perfect
outfit stitched too."

39
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,610
"I wish to make a movie
on our love story."

40
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:11,010
"I wish to make a movie
on our love story."

41
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:19,700
"I wish to make a movie
on our love story."

42
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,170
Bloody hell.

43
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,760
You've brought sweets
for such a small degree?

44
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,140
We'll vanish if this continues.

45
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,390
You can take it in writing.

46
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,670
We'll starve to death.

47
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,350
If this continues.

48
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,440
Go and give this back.

49
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,720
It's sweet, just like you.

50
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,790
Good thinking, grandpa.

51
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,850
Just have two and you are done.

52
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,450
Grandpa, my future education?

53
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:20,510
Why do you need
more education, son?

54
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:21,880
You want to be
someone else's slave?

55
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,940
You fool, jobs are no good.

56
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:27,360
Look, jobs are for those
who don't have anything.

57
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:30,060
You are a Jatt.

58
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,490
You have 50 acres
of land under your belt.

59
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:33,750
You are well respected.

60
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,480
Look at your status.

61
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:43,400
It's a bad thing if it's empty.
This one is full, have a look.

62
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,050
Don't worry.
Today is an auspicious day.

63
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,710
Many people will come
to you to pay the bill.

64
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,660
You will get a lot of money.

65
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,320
You tell me,
are you going to say yes or no?

66
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,270
For what?

67
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,380
To fall in love.

68
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,000
No, no way.

69
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:03,160
Romance has blacked out since
you joined the power department.

70
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,780
Don't do this. Be smart about it.
Say yes.

71
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,350
You have 50 buffaloes.

72
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,160
I will have to drug myself
before milking them.

73
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,710
I am better off like this
than romancing like that.

74
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,320
No, we're well respected here.

75
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,920
I'll be your king and you'll be
my queen. We'll have a great life.

76
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,930
You stink worse than the cattle do.

77
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:20,720
You think you are well respected,
you are a king?

78
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,530
Look over there.
There comes the Emperor.

79
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,790
Grandpa,
at least wear proper shoes.

80
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,390
You are going to the market.
People look at you.

81
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:39,060
Showing off made many
kings lose their kingdom.

82
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,760
Like this. We will lose
200 acres just like this.

83
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:43,970
Listen..

84
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,120
Why would people look at me anyway?

85
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,580
Am I related to them?

86
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,810
Showing off is a waste of time.

87
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:55,740
According to me, once you pocket the
money, you should never take it out.

88
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,210
Even if that results in your death.

89
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:58,810
Yes.

90
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,900
You are incomparable.

91
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,430
Here's your bag.

92
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,200
How much do I owe you?

93
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,770
Five sacks of cotton seed cake.
A box of tea.

94
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,090
- A sack of sugar.
- Yes.

95
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:29,970
You owe me 10,200 rupees.
Take this.

96
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:33,110
10,000 is fine. That's
the usual amount we always pay.

97
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:35,020
What's this 200 for?
Give me a detailed account.

98
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,840
- Chotu!
- Yes?

99
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,610
Go and get the soap.

100
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,380
Last time one piece
of this soap was ordered.

101
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,680
This time eight pieces
have been ordered.

102
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:54,420
The new daughter-in-law
will make us pauper.

103
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:58,090
I had told them not to get
an educated daughter-in-law.

104
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:03,810
Sir, if you want to keep
the mare in check..

105
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:05,920
..then you should separate
it from the horse.

106
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,760
Shaunki is an expert at it.

107
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,130
He sends people abroad.

108
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,770
He will send him abroad.

109
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:14,100
They make more money abroad.

110
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:18,550
Moreover, the mare will
be away from the horse.

111
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,100
Okay.

112
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,420
Have a look.

113
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,420
Where is he?

114
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,080
What are you doing?

115
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:32,350
Wait, I'll find it.

116
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:33,490
- Come on out!
- Find it.

117
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,750
Aunt, give me one more.
Please give me one more.

118
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:38,760
I've already given you
all one each. Get lost now.

119
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,980
Here, make me a drink.

120
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,860
They must be in it.
Where can they go?

121
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,140
We will find it.

122
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:45,810
Here, enjoy it.

123
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:46,950
That's enough.

124
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,340
- They all want to mug us.
- Yes.

125
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,090
- He only offered four apples for a kilo.
- Yes.

126
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:52,080
Look at this one. We got
16 of these apples for a kilo.

127
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,510
Now each member
will get a piece each.

128
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:56,200
- True. Look this.
- Right, grandpa.

129
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,110
Father, why did you
have to bring apples?

130
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,840
We had it just last month.

131
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,680
You could have brought another
5 kilos cotton seed cake instead.

132
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:06,030
You don't let the kids eat well.

133
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:10,390
- Don't worry, let them enjoy it.
- Here you go, son. Have an apple.

134
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,960
- What's this?
- An apple, dear.

135
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,920
Enjoy your apple.

136
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:19,830
What is this?

137
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,550
An apple.

138
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:24,610
We get such big strawberries
at my daddy's house.

139
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,740
You call this an apple?

140
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,370
It's still an apple.

141
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,060
What do I do with it?

142
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:35,750
- Even plums are bigger than this.
- Apple!

143
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,430
- I saw it first.
- Why am I stuck with the misers?

144
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:40,200
- He has put it in his mouth! Wait, you!
- No! It's mine.

145
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,560
- He ate whole apple.
- Come on. Cough it out.

146
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,980
Make him stand up. Cough it out.
His eyes are popping out.

147
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,710
- Spit it out. Yes.
- It came out.

148
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,800
- I'll eat it.
- Good.

149
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,250
Greet it properly.

150
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,520
Touch both its tyres.

151
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:57,940
It is our saviour.

152
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:01,300
We have 250 acres
only because of it.

153
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,610
Otherwise,
we wouldn't have been able..

154
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,620
..to have enough land
to have a cattle shed.

155
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:10,550
You just wait and watch what
happens to all of you after I am gone.

156
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,220
You all will starve to death.

157
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,060
There is no one like you, dear.

158
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:17,180
Here's your dinner, grandpa.

159
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:18,790
I am not your grandpa.

160
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:21,180
Fine, you are not.

161
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,500
Why went your anger on food?

162
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,570
Eat it.

163
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:24,960
Be a good grandpa and have it.

164
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,790
All the time people are showing
anger by making sounds.

165
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,110
I think we should
send Bhaktu abroad.

166
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:37,270
What do you say, Dilip Kaur?

167
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:40,730
Yes, grandpa. This is a great idea.

168
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,610
I have a friend in Australia.

169
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:44,980
And my aunt's daughter
stays in Canada.

170
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,170
And their dollar is
pretty strong as well.

171
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,240
We both will go to Canada.

172
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:56,000
We won't be able to two people.

173
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,440
Bhaktu will go alone.

174
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,390
And not to America or Canada..

175
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,960
I'll send him to
Doha or Qatar, okay?

176
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,440
- Idiot!
- Sister-in-law!

177
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,190
- Hello?
- Stop it.

178
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,550
- Mummy?
- Why are you getting upset?

179
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,350
I am not happy over here.

180
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:18,670
Yes, it would've been better
if you had drowned me instead.

181
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,510
They get strawberry sized apples.

182
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:23,430
Mummy, you don't know anything.

183
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,530
- I have to work all day long.
- Wait!

184
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,200
Money minded dog.

185
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,410
- And now they have come
up with a new drama. - I..

186
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:31,540
They say they will
send him to Doha, Qatar.

187
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,450
That too alone.

188
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:37,040
Send daddy over with
the council members.

189
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,710
- That's it.
- Oh God.

190
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,350
Fine. Okay.

191
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:41,570
- Leave it.
- There.

192
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:43,190
My daddy's coming tomorrow.

193
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:45,320
- You just wait and watch.
- Listen to me.

194
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,390
Our girl has cleared
16 grades, uncle.

195
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,080
16?

196
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,770
She has cleared 35 grades.

197
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:59,260
There has to be a reason.

198
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:03,410
Look, there are two bars
of soap kept here.

199
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:06,640
That's a fragrant one
and this one's the local soap.

200
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,530
Look at them and tell me
which kid bathed with which soap.

201
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:11,960
Tell me.

202
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,220
Grandpa, that contains chemicals.

203
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,460
They are harmful for the skin.

204
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,840
- We don't want to ruin her skin.
- Yes.

205
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,390
Then bathe her with
curd or buttermilk.

206
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:24,480
And what you just gibbered
in English is not true.

207
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,830
Right.

208
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,810
Get lost!

209
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,120
Wait!

210
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,800
I agree they are newly weds.

211
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:41,900
But I don't think fragrant soaps
will make them love each other more.

212
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,660
People used to have
7-8 kids back in the days.

213
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,280
There was no lack of love.

214
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,020
Nowadays, they do a lot of drama.

215
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,020
But they barely manage to have one
kid. This is how things are now.

216
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,640
Tell me, it's not like
I'll take everything with me.

217
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:01,040
I have worked hard to make
all the wealth and property.

218
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,010
I cannot let it go waste like this.

219
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,250
Hey hello! Listen up.

220
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,570
Think about it. You will rule.

221
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,210
I'll get the same treatment
your sister-in-law is getting.

222
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:15,760
Forget it.
Just following your ancestors.

223
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,600
I want to send him abroad.

224
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,660
You should think about your girl.

225
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,370
Do you want to let her stay here.

226
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,150
Or do you want to take her along?

227
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,080
Yes, tell us.

228
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:36,960
Wait, listen to me.

229
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:39,910
Here, keep it in the truck.

230
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,300
Lock it up.

231
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:45,370
50.

232
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,470
I was saying..

233
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,810
..that we should get new clothes
stitched for the kids this time?

234
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:56,940
Have you lost your mind, Dilipo?

235
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,650
We got them new clothes
just a year and a half ago.

236
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,860
They only used it for one wedding,
Bhakta's wedding.

237
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,140
They tore them so soon?

238
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,590
You are incomparable.

239
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:05,640
Give me the keys.

240
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:06,930
Here you go.

241
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,430
I won't spare your old man.

242
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,830
I'll strangle him,
you just wait and watch.

243
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,080
Don't cry.

244
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,090
- I'll be back before you know it.
- Okay.

245
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,850
- Grandpa, let me handle the bus.
- Don't do this.

246
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:19,580
- Enough of goodbyes already.
- I will do it.

247
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,040
Why is everyone gathered here?

248
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,490
You guys are always grumbling.

249
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:23,940
Do you even plan to let him leave?

250
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,470
- Come on, let's go.
- Bye, grandma.

251
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,630
Yes, let's go.

252
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,540
- Come.
- Where do you think you guys are going?

253
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,580
Always following
each other like sheeps.

254
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,420
- Sit down!
- Okay.

255
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,270
- Why did you sit down, son? Stand up.
- Okay.

256
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,270
Go and get the fragrant
soaps from inside.

257
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:39,670
- Okay, grandpa. I'll get them.
- Go.

258
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,720
I'll be going to meet
the grocer anyway.

259
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,260
I'll return the soaps as well.

260
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,860
It will help save some money.

261
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,740
Do you plan to stand here forever?

262
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,830
Who will get on the plane then?
Your father? Let's go.

263
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,850
- Why are you sitting on the ground?
- Grandpa.

264
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,090
- Sit on the bed.
- Here you go.

265
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:57,570
- Put it in here.
- Open the bag. Put it in.

266
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,460
- Let's go, son.
- We too want to go with them.

267
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,690
Shut up. He wants to go with us.

268
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,490
Calm down!

269
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,900
Mummy, what have you got me into!

270
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,160
Don't cry, sister-in-law.
We don't always get what we want.

271
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,800
Grandpa didn't let me
study further either.

272
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:17,920
I won't let my sister
married into this family.

273
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,610
I don't know, I don't
want her to suffer over here.

274
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:24,230
I'll do it if this old man dies.

275
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,220
What is this, sister-in-law?

276
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:39,640
A mosquito net?

277
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,520
You filthy man.

278
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:46,490
This too will get burned now.

279
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,150
Sister-in-law, why are you burning it?
Brother has left, mosquitoes haven't.

280
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:54,230
Aunt, uncle never went
anywhere without me.

281
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,600
Where has he gone today?

282
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,380
He has gone to see off Bhaktu.

283
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,740
- Uncle, tea.
- Okay.

284
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,380
There's your uncle.

285
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,680
Oh no, we are ruined!

286
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,580
Grandpa's gone!

287
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,450
Grandpa!

288
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:17,460
- What's wrong?
- Father! Father!

289
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,470
Father!

290
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,920
How will we live without you?

291
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,450
- What's wrong?
- What has happened to our afther?

292
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,000
Grandpa's gone.

293
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,100
Why is grandpa standing like that.

294
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,350
He's standing there,
but he isn't with us.

295
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,250
- Get him out.
- Grandpa!

296
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:31,190
- Grandpa! Move.
- Father!

297
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:34,290
- Move aside!
- Oh grandpa!

298
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:36,190
Lift him up.
Pull him up, be careful.

299
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,460
- Lift him up. Be careful.
- Release his hand.

300
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:41,010
- Lift him up.
- Release his hand.

301
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,650
- Leave him.
- Oh, no..

302
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:45,440
Bhalla, do one thing.
Quickly get a saw.

303
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:46,770
You want to cut his hand?

304
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,980
Not his hand, we will
have to cut the pipe, Nikka.

305
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,710
Where are you, uncle?

306
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:56,410
Oh Paalo, grandpa is dead.

307
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:00,390
We shall no longer
live a miser's life.

308
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,760
We will lead a good life.

309
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,580
- Just say yes.
- Shut up.

310
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,240
Grandpa!

311
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,750
- Grandpa!
- Grandpa!

312
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,250
Get lost!

313
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:12,700
He was my grandpa as well.
Can't she console me as well?

314
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,630
Why would she console you?

315
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,360
- Grandpa!
- Grandpa!

316
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,610
- Stay away.
- Oh grandpa!

317
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,190
Oh grandpa!

318
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,340
Big or small, uncle?

319
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,970
- Grandpa!
- Grandpa?

320
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:26,370
- Grandpa?
- Be careful.

321
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:30,280
- Careful, uncle.
- Grandpa! Grandpa!

322
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,710
Old man, you couldn't
take them with you, could you?

323
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,440
Good that he is dead.

324
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,150
Grandpa got stuck in the bus.

325
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,740
Don't you have any shame,
you greedy woman?

326
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,650
- Shut up.
- Grandpa!

327
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,980
Hold his hand and get him out.

328
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,250
- Lift him up.
- Come on.

329
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:49,230
Very good, Nikka.

330
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,820
- Be careful.
- Come on.

331
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,030
Let's go. Be careful.

332
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,760
We need record a unique song.

333
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,880
Don't worry about the money.
My gramps will invest in it.

334
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,900
Do you know who
will be the lyricist?

335
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,670
Jaani or Beat Baljit.

336
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:04,660
We will have Shahnez Gill
and Mansi Khurana as the models.

337
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,660
Both of them.

338
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,450
- Both of them?
- Yes.

339
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,000
Brother, grandpa is dead.

340
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,640
Get aunt along with
you and come to the village.

341
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:22,380
My financer is dead.

342
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,020
Here, son.

343
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,900
Who are they?

344
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,370
Ruby's or Gaganveer's?

345
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:33,440
Mother, gramps is dead.

346
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:40,630
Don't worry, mother.
Elders leave us in old age.

347
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:44,260
Son, elders can
go wherever they want.

348
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:50,430
I am worried about your album.

349
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:55,340
Oh Zaildar!

350
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:02,270
You had said you would die only
after you own 2000 acres of land.

351
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:07,480
You died so soon, Zaildar!

352
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:14,810
Oh Zaildar!

353
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,970
Uncle has left us!

354
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:24,070
I feel lost, uncle!

355
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,750
Stand up, uncle.

356
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:30,600
I am nothing without you.

357
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,200
Don't crowd over here.

358
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,210
This is my gramps final journey.

359
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:35,970
Please share it.

360
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:38,940
He was going to help me make an album.
It will get a little delayed now.

361
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,150
I will release the song
after his final prayers.

362
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:43,260
Share my gramps.

363
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,190
Grandpa is very heavy.

364
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,880
We will need to carry
the one who is dead.

365
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,640
We cannot any other
villager instead.

366
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,080
The way you are behaving, I
doubt you'll lend me your shoulder.

367
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:57,360
- Let's go. Let's go.
- They are taking him away.

368
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:02,390
- Uncle!
- Grandpa!

369
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,200
Be careful.

370
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,200
- Be careful.
- Father!

371
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,340
- Almost there.
- Be careful.

372
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:14,550
Boys, his face should
be on that side.

373
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:16,190
Like you have been
to heaven, Setha.

374
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,310
Keep him here and keep him there.

375
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:19,490
- We have kept where we wanted to.
- Give it to me.

376
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:22,680
Gather some dry wood.

377
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,590
My uncle..

378
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:26,790
Keep this pure clarified
butter in my car.

379
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:29,190
Give me the garland.

380
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,610
- Put him this garland.
- Be careful.

381
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:33,390
- Here.
- Give it to me.

382
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:36,720
Let me go.
I want to go with grandpa.

383
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,330
I want to go with grandpa.

384
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:39,860
- Don't cry.
- I want to go.

385
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,410
Go then.

386
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,660
Move back, grandpa is too hot.

387
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,440
Grandpa.

388
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:51,970
Mother,
they have set father on fire.

389
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:56,370
Make sure you use
pure clarified butter.

390
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:01,310
Damn you!
Don't you have any shame?

391
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:03,290
Idiots! Stay there.

392
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,780
I am going.

393
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,780
Father is dead.

394
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:11,880
There are so many people at home.

395
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,960
If any of us would have been dead..

396
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:16,330
..father exactly would know
what to do and what not to do.

397
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:18,470
Grandpa didn't like spending money.

398
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:23,870
Let's keep tea and snacks, simple
vegetarian food and Jalebis for sweets.

399
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:24,590
- Yes.
- Right, uncle?

400
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:25,930
Kola is right.

401
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:26,950
- This is what we should do.
- Yes.

402
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,320
Like hell he is right.

403
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:31,830
Listen Kola,
what do you guys lack in?

404
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,720
Father has so much property.

405
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:37,140
You won't die if you
will spend some money.

406
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,610
We will do everything possible.
We will do top class arrangements.

407
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:41,650
You are like the frogs in a pond.

408
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:44,160
My Jagdeep will handle everything.

409
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,770
We will rock it, grandma. What
else do we have so much money for?

410
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:49,510
We'll have such a great program
that everyone will always remember..

411
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,690
..that it was Jagdeep's
gramps final prayers.

412
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:54,280
We will serve patties and pastries.

413
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,270
Five types of fritters and sweets.

414
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:59,460
We will have a
multi-cuisine buffet.

415
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,810
Grandma, we will give the catering
contract to Sangam Caterers.

416
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:03,470
After all your gramps
can die only once.

417
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,840
We will play music
and have fun too.

418
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,340
Right.

419
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,500
Waiter, come here.

420
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,070
Yes.

421
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:23,620
Did you try these?

422
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,550
- Get me a cappuccino.
- Let's go.

423
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,070
With cocoa powder in it.

424
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:30,310
- Come, let's enjoy a cappuccino.
- Okay.

425
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:32,850
Thousands of people have gathered
here to join us in our grief.

426
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,810
He is my uncle's son, Nikka.

427
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,440
How are you, Nikka?

428
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,330
- Say hello to everyone.
- Hello.

429
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,070
Give a blast!

430
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,150
Here mummy, have some cake.

431
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,040
Please accept my condolences.

432
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,390
Condolences for what?
Have you lost your mind?

433
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:51,900
You won't get such a party again.

434
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,840
Eat, drink and enjoy yourself.
Go and enjoy the patties.

435
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,910
Give him some patties.
Go and enjoy them.

436
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,190
Shanti, tell me about this.

437
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,640
Mummy, try this mocktail.

438
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,610
- It's delicious.
- Try this.

439
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:02,490
Yes?

440
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:28,410
Hey, what are you staring at?

441
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:29,540
If we are doing this kind
of arrangement for a funeral..

442
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,030
..then imagine what
we will do for our wedding.

443
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,340
My grandpa has
saved a lot of money.

444
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,610
We will have a grand wedding.

445
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:37,700
You just wait and watch.

446
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:40,300
Smell it. Smell it, come on.

447
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,550
What's working?

448
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:44,640
Fog! It works, doesn't it?

449
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,900
Not fog,
it's the final prayer for grandpa.

450
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,590
What are you doing here?
Go and handle the relatives.

451
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:51,680
- You handle them.
- Why?

452
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,540
I like her.

453
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:55,940
I too like her.

454
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:56,970
I like her from before.

455
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:58,610
I like her from the very beginning.
Get lost now.

456
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,990
Go!

457
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,740
Excuse me!

458
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:03,980
Leave!

459
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,760
Get lost! Run away!

460
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:15,270
Open your mouth. Open it.

461
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:31,590
"I don't know anyone
other than you, my dear."

462
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:37,160
"I don't know how to act smart,
my dear."

463
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:41,390
"I don't know anyone
other than you, my dear."

464
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:44,160
"I don't know how to act smart,
my dear."

465
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,290
"You always sit very close to me."

466
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:49,990
"All I see is just you.."

467
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:52,690
"You always sit very close to me."

468
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:55,300
"All I see is just you.."

469
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,740
"In my heart."

470
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:03,520
"How are you related to me?"

471
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,690
"Let me make the announcement
on the speaker."

472
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:09,140
"How are you related to me?"

473
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,970
"Let me make the announcement
on the speaker."

474
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:16,290
"Let me make the announcement
on the speaker."

475
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,960
"You are pink,
just like the flowers."

476
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,720
"You are even lighter
than flowers."

477
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,550
"Everyone in the village asks me.."

478
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:51,180
"..which village
does she hail from?"

479
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:54,110
"You are pink,
just like the flowers."

480
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:56,910
"You are even lighter
than flowers."

481
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:59,850
"Everyone in the village asks me.."

482
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:02,480
"..which village
does she hail from?"

483
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,250
"I am generous, my dear."

484
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:08,050
"I am generous, my dear."

485
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:11,320
"I am not counted
with the cheaters."

486
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,060
"How are you related to me?"

487
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:19,250
"Let me make the announcement
on the speaker."

488
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:21,710
"How are you related to me?"

489
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:24,420
"Let me make the announcement
on the speaker."

490
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:28,750
"Let me make the announcement
on the speaker."

491
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,960
Have it all by yourself?

492
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:42,760
How about offering
some to others as well?

493
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:45,250
Uncles are sitting over there.

494
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:47,650
I'm going there, to serve them.

495
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,530
There.

496
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:02,820
There you go. Come on.

497
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,800
Down you go.

498
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,920
Here it is.

499
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:27,780
He's kept it as if it feels cold.

500
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,690
Let me have a look.

501
00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:00,030
- Grandma's stick?
- What's this?

502
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,250
Here, grandma.

503
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:42,700
Hold it and wait here.

504
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,590
Let me talk to them.

505
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,210
What were you saying?

506
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:49,780
Mother, boys were saying
that we should buy an Innova.

507
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:53,220
And stitch new
clothes for everyone.

508
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,570
Why?

509
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:56,920
What will you do
with the new clothes?

510
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:59,980
We got you new clothes
just a year and half ago.

511
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:02,680
Grandpa,
you too are wearing new clothes.

512
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,580
He's just kidding.

513
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,030
Why?

514
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,950
Am I his sister-in-law
that he will joke with me?

515
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,100
Don't joke with me.

516
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,320
I'll shoot all of you.

517
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:22,740
I won't give a
penny more to anyone.

518
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:26,300
Things will be as they were.

519
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:28,740
- Okay, grandma.
- I am a lioness.

520
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,660
A lioness's will.

521
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,660
A lioness will do as she pleases.

522
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:36,800
Dogs and tomcats cannot even breathe
without the lioness's permission.

523
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:39,550
And you?

524
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:42,780
Wasted 700,000 at
the old man's funeral!

525
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:46,080
Was it your father's
wedding or his funeral?

526
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,550
She says, "Mummy, have some cake!"

527
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:53,960
He gave birth to such boys and his
daughter pretends to be Sonam Bajwa.

528
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,830
Listen up,
both of you have lunch and leave.

529
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,540
- Bye, aunt. Goodbye.
- Bye.

530
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,090
Bye.

531
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,830
Take your son along.

532
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,480
Grandma, how about a selfie?

533
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,910
Are you leaving or not?
He wants a selfie!

534
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:18,920
- Listen up, boys.
- Yes, grandma?

535
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,580
Pack all the old man's clothes and
throw them at the memorial ground.

536
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:24,410
- Okay.
- Okay, grandma.

537
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:26,570
From today,
I shall rule this house.

538
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,820
Okay.

539
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:31,450
And that junk which is parked
over there, sell it as scrap.

540
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:32,770
But mother, it is our Baba.

541
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,610
- We sell Baba?
- Shut up.

542
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,370
Collecting all junk in here.

543
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:38,180
They and their precious Baba.

544
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:40,880
You, go and clean the room.

545
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,580
Good that the old man is dead.

546
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,150
Bloody miser.

547
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,530
I'll have that room
locked right away.

548
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:40,740
Kept cribbing all day.

549
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,530
We finally get rid of him.

550
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:47,520
These children have nothing
else to do except playing.

551
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,260
If you ask them
to work they run away.

552
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,490
Oh God.

553
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:57,760
I am sure it is Nikka.

554
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,720
Did you see?

555
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:22,550
What has happened?

556
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:24,560
How did the door fall?

557
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,160
Mother.

558
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,420
Wait, you bloody bloodsuckers!

559
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,760
You will make me go broke!
Wait, you..

560
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:54,940
What is wrong with him?

561
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:58,940
I worked hard all my life.
I never even had an orange candy!

562
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:02,740
And those people feasted
on my hard earned money!

563
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:08,040
Tell me, when you went to
immerse uncle's ashes did you say..

564
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,460
"Come on, let's go father?"

565
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,860
- No one said it.
- I didn't.

566
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:13,100
There you go then,
Nikka's possessed by uncle.

567
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,560
He's right in front of you.

568
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,460
What is wrong with him?

569
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:23,270
- Nikka!
- You!

570
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:25,340
- No, Nikka!
- Enough!

571
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:28,010
Nikka!

572
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:29,470
- Father!
- Oh no, that's freezing cold water.

573
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:31,990
Not the bucket!

574
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:35,490
- What's going on?
- Wait, you..

575
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:37,940
- Careful there!
- There you go!

576
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:40,210
- Grandpa! - Wait. I'll teach
each one of you a lesson.

577
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:42,200
- I'll..
- Nikka, what are you doing?

578
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,700
Come on, confront me!

579
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,900
You have never ever dared
to speak a word before me!

580
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:46,860
Now they want to get back at me.

581
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,900
I'll break everyone's bones!

582
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,130
- Your old man is back.
- Hold him down.

583
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:52,900
- Come on.
- Let me go. I won't spare anyone.

584
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,740
You old woman, you want to rule us?

585
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,670
She is the queen!

586
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:58,940
Wait, I'll give you the keys.

587
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:02,240
I had told them
not to spend so much.

588
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,290
Ask them!

589
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:05,220
Father, please let Nikka go.

590
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,660
- Right, let me.
- Be a good father.

591
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,900
- Let me go!
- Father, please let him go.

592
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,620
I'll rule everyone! I'll have fun!

593
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,020
- Stay back!
- Uncle!

594
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,500
Oh no, the old man is back.

595
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:14,380
- Father?
- Get him, get him.

596
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,420
Stop it.

597
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,460
- I'll teach all of you a lesson.
- Grab him.

598
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:21,420
- Hold him down. Hold him down.
- I'll break your bones.

599
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,120
- Move aside.
- Hold his hand. Hold him.

600
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,290
Let me go. Come on. Get lost.

601
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:28,430
- Tie him to the bed.
- Come on, take him.

602
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:30,500
- No, no, no. No, father.
- Hold him down.

603
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,860
- No, don't.
- Hold him down.

604
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,220
Let me go!

605
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,780
Come on father,
ask them to untie me.

606
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,820
- Father, ask them to untie me.
- Be careful.

607
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,380
- Secure it.
- Father!

608
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:42,500
- Untie him.
- Be careful.

609
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,960
- Shut up.
- Yes.

610
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,100
No. Please untie me.

611
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,390
- Father!
- Take care of him. I am leaving.

612
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:51,600
Father!

613
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,170
He broke the bed.

614
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,850
He chewed through
such a thick rope.

615
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,690
- It is uncle for sure.
- Oh no.

616
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:19,360
- Aunt, kids these days
cannot even eat sugarcane. - Yes.

617
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:21,340
This was done by
an old set of teeth.

618
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,870
But father didn't have good teeth.

619
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:26,020
Come on brother, you are
back to the same thing again?

620
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,720
Uncle was always ready
to bite all the villagers.

621
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,320
And you say he had bad teeth?

622
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:33,480
- Uncle!
- Yes?

623
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,300
I had come to take the bull.

624
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,900
Untie and take him.

625
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:37,820
Okay.

626
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,380
We will quickly need
to find a solution.

627
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,500
Yes.

628
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:43,880
Hello, grandpa.

629
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:46,220
Hello, grandpa.

630
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,960
- Greet him.
- Hello.

631
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:53,030
Souls don't leave their spots
no matter how hard you try, aunt.

632
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:56,200
- Uncle will stay in his room.
- Here he is.

633
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,570
Make me some tea, mother.

634
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,840
It's father. Look at that, mother.

635
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:12,690
He's collecting dung.

636
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:13,540
Come on.

637
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,570
Check it out, Jaila.

638
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,530
Mangal.

639
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,050
What?

640
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:20,620
Throw the shackles around him.

641
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:25,120
Tie him.

642
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,910
Go, go, go.

643
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,120
He's possessed.

644
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,130
Come on! Come on, I've caught him.

645
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:39,580
- Let me go.
- Let's go.

646
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:42,330
Let me go. I'll break your bones.

647
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:44,210
- Don't let him go.
- Let me go.

648
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:46,780
- Hold him. Hold him tight.
- At least tell me what's wrong.

649
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,590
What are you doing, father?

650
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:49,790
- Use salt to ward off the evil.
- Father!

651
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,340
- Be careful, father.
- What is wrong, father?

652
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,570
At least tell me.

653
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:59,220
At least tell me why
have you tied me down.

654
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,790
You got possessed by
your grandpa last night, son.

655
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,310
- Possessed by grandpa?
- Yes.

656
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,300
No, it's something different.

657
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:11,510
Don't beat me up. I'll explain.
Untie me. That's something else.

658
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,980
Untie me, uncle.

659
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,100
Father, please untie me.

660
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,790
Bloody hell, I want to have pizza!
Get me a pizza!

661
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:23,860
I want to wear Reebok's
shoes and Tommy's shirt!

662
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,940
I will do as I please.

663
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,420
I spent my life making money..

664
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,100
..and they didn't take
five minutes to cremate me.

665
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,740
I'll break everyone's bones.

666
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:33,820
I'll kill all of you.
You cannot escape me! Wait, you..

667
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,040
Nikka is possessed
by grandpa's ghost.

668
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:45,600
- What?
- Yes.

669
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:49,810
I think he'll spend the rest
of his life tied up like this.

670
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,380
He cannot escape this fate now.

671
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,750
Poor guy.

672
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:18,320
Wait, you bloody..

673
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:50,020
'When I started trusting him,
my love ghosted me.'

674
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,290
A bleeding heart makes
you write pen strange things.

675
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:12,500
That bloody cruel old man didn't
let us be together when he was alive.

676
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,260
He isn't let us be together
even after his death.

677
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:19,250
Oh God, what do I do now?

678
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,400
- Grandma, it hurts a lot.
- Enough, son.

679
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,840
Enough!

680
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,580
Enjoying it, aren't you?
What to have some more fun?

681
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:28,880
He wants to be a doctor.

682
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:33,530
Bloody old man,
I want him to rot in hell.

683
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:35,270
Don't ask, mother.

684
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:37,600
It is a very sad situation.

685
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,110
He bit the young boy.

686
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,410
Right.

687
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:45,360
I sing your glory God.

688
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,040
I sing your glory among devotees.

689
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,780
I sing your glory among devotees.

690
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:54,180
Go, go, gone!

691
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,200
Stop.

692
00:41:56,300 --> 00:42:00,930
Tell me, will you believe in
me if I tell everything about you?

693
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:06,450
Tell me, shall I tell everyone
what's the name of your sweetheart?

694
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:09,810
Tell me, shall I tell them who did
you watch the movie Shadaa with?

695
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:11,450
Will you believe me then?

696
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:15,910
That's it then, repeat after me.
Baba is right and you are wrong.

697
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:18,250
Baba is right and I am wrong.

698
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:21,980
Go then, take offerings.

699
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:24,460
- Okay, Baba.
- All the loose links will tie up.

700
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:25,770
Go.

701
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,020
- Come on.
- Stand up.

702
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:29,340
Tell me the truth.

703
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:32,870
I will solve all your problems.

704
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:37,300
Son, you want to challenge me?

705
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:38,730
Sit down.

706
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:42,130
Tell me, what is the problem.

707
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:45,120
Babaji, he gets
possessed by my uncle.

708
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,240
He gets possessed by
your uncle or a shadow?

709
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:52,700
I will get rid of everything
for the right penny.

710
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:56,320
Son, you didn't eat anything?
Why are you biting your nails?

711
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,150
Babaji, nails won't suffice,
he is after our lives.

712
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:00,480
I will eat it!

713
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,780
I will eat whatever I want!

714
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:04,780
I will also have your ears.

715
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:06,770
Because I am right
and Baba is wrong.

716
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:08,340
Baba is right and.. Hey!

717
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,580
You threw Baba's feathers?

718
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:14,340
He is possessed by a strong shadow.

719
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:17,620
It cannot be exorcised
in front of a crowd.

720
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,860
I will take him to my cabin.

721
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:24,250
There I will go one on one with him
and get rid of the shadow.

722
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:26,340
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

723
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:28,020
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

724
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,300
Let's go.

725
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:30,450
Let's go!

726
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:36,530
I'll eat you.
I'm telling you, I'll eat you.

727
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:38,710
Keep it down. "I'll eat you."

728
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:40,660
Tell me what's the problem.

729
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:41,660
Speak up.

730
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,960
I will talk in your favour,
you idiot.

731
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,020
Tell me.

732
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:48,380
Baba, first the old man
didn't let us do anything.

733
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:51,300
After the old man died,
I thought things would change.

734
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:53,620
But that didn't happen, then
the old woman became her reign.

735
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,000
We are still where we are.

736
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:59,320
Last night I got hold
of old man's liquor bottle.

737
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:23,030
'We didn't get shots
even when we had fever.'

738
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:25,680
'They drank shots worth 30,000.'

739
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:31,890
I got drunk and cursed them.
I went all out.

740
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:36,260
When I woke up in the morning
and tried to tell them the truth..

741
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,080
..no one came close
to me out of fear.

742
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:41,020
I thought this is
a good way to have fun.

743
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:42,920
Then I started doing this drama.

744
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:44,290
Right?

745
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:47,740
Done.

746
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:49,720
Baba shall help you.

747
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:52,900
Don't overact out there.

748
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:54,520
Do as I say.

749
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,230
If I ask you to keep quiet,
you'll keep quiet.

750
00:44:56,530 --> 00:44:57,330
Let's go.

751
00:44:57,410 --> 00:45:00,320
- "Hail the Baba who.."
- Enough.

752
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:02,040
- Mother!
- Yes?

753
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,940
I have your boy under control.

754
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:05,740
- Enough.
- Hail the Baba!

755
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:07,140
- You will no longer shout.
- Okay.

756
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:09,390
You will not do anything.
I won't do anything to everyone.

757
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,870
- Tell everyone who you are.
- Yes.

758
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:13,900
Very good.

759
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:15,580
I am Vaisakha, Dilipo's husband!

760
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,160
- Enough!
- He's my son!

761
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,310
- He held me down!
- No! Sit down.

762
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:21,460
- Sit down.
- Sit down quietly.

763
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:24,100
I worked hard and
made money all my life.

764
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,460
Now they are acting
like their mother.

765
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:27,780
Enough.

766
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:29,450
Everyone will listen to you.

767
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:31,750
Tell me, what do you want?

768
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:33,890
I want to have a good time.
Show me a good time.

769
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:37,410
Will you leave after
you have a good time?

770
00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:39,250
Yes, I will leave
after I have a good time.

771
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:42,300
Mother, get this straight.

772
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,860
You need to fulfil all his demands.

773
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:47,490
- Okay.
- Secondly!

774
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:50,340
- Okay.
- No one will tie him down.

775
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:52,960
- Okay, Baba.
- All the family members..

776
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,860
..need to wear these bells instead.

777
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:56,810
- Yes?
- Take this, mother.

778
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:59,770
I'll leave only
if I have a good time.

779
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:01,970
I'll take you along if I
don't have a good time, Dilip Kaur.

780
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:03,930
All say hail the Baba!

781
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:06,610
Hail the Baba!

782
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:08,570
Aunt, now do you
believe in the Baba?

783
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:12,410
Do you believe in Baba?

784
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:18,340
Grandpa.

785
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:20,540
Here.

786
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:22,860
Bloody old man, won't leave
us alone even after his death.

787
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:24,320
Look at his behaviour.

788
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:26,930
Only my orders will
be followed in this house.

789
00:46:27,010 --> 00:46:29,480
- Okay, father.
- In jungle, only one lion.

790
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,770
- Okay.
- Get me Filmy Duniya magazine.

791
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:33,230
- I want to read it.
- We'll get it.

792
00:46:33,310 --> 00:46:34,940
I want a mobile phone
which has a camera in it.

793
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:36,860
- The one which opens like this.
- Okay, father.

794
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:38,340
- Better note it down right away.
- Yes.

795
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:40,390
I don't want you
to say that you forgot.

796
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:43,340
Have fun, father. Have fun.

797
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:44,340
It's not a problem.

798
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:45,950
Make sure your old
man has a good time.

799
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:47,280
Your father is here
to have a good time.

800
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:49,740
I wonder when will
we get rid of this trouble.

801
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:51,820
No grandma,
why should we get rid of him?

802
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:54,260
Sages catch ghosts and
make them do whatever they want.

803
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:55,500
He is our grandpa.

804
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:57,720
You just wait and watch,
he'll find buried treasures for us.

805
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,080
- Really?
- Yes.

806
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,280
You are Alladin.

807
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,060
Nikka is the lamp
and grandpa is the genie.

808
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:04,420
We will rub Nikka
and grandpa will show up.

809
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:05,540
- Yes.
- Oh really?

810
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:08,210
He will fold his hands and
say "whatever you say, my master."

811
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:09,500
"Whatever you say, my master."

812
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:11,150
You will rule once again.
You will be his master.

813
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:16,430
Get lost! What are you looking at?

814
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:17,970
Go away from here! Get lost!

815
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:30,210
Here.

816
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:33,220
Let me tell you,
you guys are so slow!

817
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,190
I am not having a good time.

818
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:38,330
I asked you to get Filmy
Duniya magazine for me.

819
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:39,720
You couldn't even get that for me.

820
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,780
And get me a
Macdonald's burger too.

821
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:44,850
Otherwise, I'll tie all
the calves on the terrace.

822
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:46,320
Moreover..

823
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:49,370
Do you understand?

824
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:52,020
Father, mother has sent
Charan to get the burger.

825
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:55,200
Sudhakar will get the Filmy Duniya
magazine from the bus stop by evening.

826
00:47:56,490 --> 00:47:58,880
I want to eat the burger right now!

827
00:47:58,960 --> 00:47:59,670
Do you understand?

828
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:01,460
Otherwise,
I will throw all your drums.

829
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:04,770
I had told you I want
to eat momos as well.

830
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:06,100
Let's go, ma'am.

831
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:08,180
Mother has the keys and
she has gone to Sarpanch's house.

832
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,140
We can get the momos
only if we get the money.

833
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:11,350
How about an onion instead?

834
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,210
I'll break your teeth. Shut up.

835
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:16,620
Behave yourself,
I am warning everyone.

836
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:18,420
Don't make me break your legs.

837
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,330
When he was of sound mind,
his body was not fine.

838
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:24,720
Now when his body is fine,
he has lost his mind.

839
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:28,960
Oh God, why are you
against those in love?

840
00:48:36,970 --> 00:48:38,850
You sold my tractor Baba.

841
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:41,140
I will sell everything
that belongs to you.

842
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:42,130
Stop!

843
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:45,390
Give me the keys to the trunk
or else I will eat your kidneys.

844
00:48:45,470 --> 00:48:47,000
Come on down.
Stop staring at me.

845
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:49,510
Why are you troubling everyone?

846
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:53,080
He hit me hard.

847
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,220
- Give him keys.
- Why should I give?

848
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:57,160
- I will not give it.
- Give him the keys.

849
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,310
- Father!
- Did you enjoy that?

850
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:02,510
Give me the keys, I said.

851
00:49:02,590 --> 00:49:05,550
This idiot has scared everyone
and sent them to the terrace.

852
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:06,810
Run away. Come on.

853
00:49:06,890 --> 00:49:09,310
No grandma,
I am here to take the bull.

854
00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:10,980
The bull is standing right
in front of you. Take him.

855
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:12,290
Don't come close to me,
I am warning you.

856
00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:13,550
I'll break all your teeth
with a single punch.

857
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:16,160
No, I don't need to invite trouble.

858
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,670
- I am warning you old woman,
give me my keys. - Give him the keys.

859
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:20,060
You are making me lose my mind.

860
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:22,560
I worked hard all my life and
now you are acting like a queen.

861
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:26,100
Do you understand? I will teach
everyone a lesson, you old hag.

862
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:27,950
- Give me my keys.
- I hold him.

863
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:30,140
I told you not to come here,
Mangal.

864
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:32,260
- You don't listen to me, do you?
- Wait.. I will not spare you.

865
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:34,460
- I told you, I will..
- You will dislocate his arm.

866
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:36,650
I will not spare you.

867
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:38,510
Why are you staring at me?

868
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:40,960
I will throw everyone away,
just like that.

869
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:44,950
Grandma!
I have dislocated my shoulder.

870
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,000
Eat it.

871
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:55,010
You will not get this chance again.

872
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:16,160
- The ghost didn't leave him as yet?
- No, he hasn't.

873
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:18,020
Look at the way he is behaving.

874
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:19,540
He burnt his stomach.

875
00:50:20,410 --> 00:50:22,500
Oh no.

876
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:24,930
- Eat some more.
- Gandma, the old man has lost it.

877
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:27,020
I am feeling shy even to say it.

878
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:28,960
But he didn't feel shy to say it.

879
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,900
'He said who knows when
Bhaktu will come back.'

880
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:32,280
'Let me help you out.'

881
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,370
- I am so unfortunate.
- Really?

882
00:50:34,450 --> 00:50:36,440
Do you think I am lying?

883
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:37,770
Don't cry.

884
00:50:37,850 --> 00:50:39,860
Is it true?

885
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:42,380
Yes, it is true. Why would I lie?

886
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:44,190
I will do as I please.

887
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:46,720
If I wish to help
someone out then I will.

888
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,680
'Come on, I felt cold so I asked for
a blanket from my sister-in-law.'

889
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,160
'Why do I need to lie about that?'

890
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,980
'My foolish family.'

891
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:57,070
Aunt, we should show
him to another sage.

892
00:50:57,510 --> 00:50:59,310
This old man is troubling us.

893
00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:01,610
- You get ready. Leave the rest to me.
- Okay.

894
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:03,630
No. Let me go!

895
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:05,590
I am telling you, let me go!

896
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:07,720
Don't you have any
respect for your old man?

897
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:08,880
I don't want to go anywhere.

898
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,760
- I.. Let me go.
- Come on.

899
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:12,970
I am not possessed by grandpa.
I am Nikka.

900
00:51:13,050 --> 00:51:14,650
- I'll teach you a lesson.
- Let me go, uncle.

901
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:17,890
Take him away.
Take the old man away.

902
00:51:17,970 --> 00:51:19,650
May you get infested by worms,
you devil.

903
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:20,900
May he burn alive.

904
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:22,520
He has been troubling
our whole family.

905
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:24,940
- Take this damned man away.
- Get in. Hurry up.

906
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:36,730
Immerse them.

907
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:39,360
- Hail the Baba!
- Hail the Baba!

908
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:40,750
Hail to thee!

909
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:48,640
- What's troubling you, son?
- He gets possessed by our old man.

910
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:50,500
Well done.

911
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:51,850
He says he gets
possessed by our old man.

912
00:51:51,930 --> 00:51:53,240
I won't go so easily.

913
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:56,750
We will capture him
and lock him in a bottle.

914
00:51:56,830 --> 00:51:58,890
- How will you put me in a bottle?
- No! No!

915
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:02,600
I'll show you how.

916
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:07,610
Come on.

917
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:13,360
Oh damn.

918
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,210
You have a lot of current in you.

919
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:17,140
Come on, let's go inside.

920
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:19,510
- No, I won't.
- Look at him getting scared.

921
00:52:19,590 --> 00:52:21,680
I am not a doctor
who will inject you.

922
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:22,490
Come on, let's go.

923
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:23,850
Uncle, I am absolutely fine.
Let's go home.

924
00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:24,900
Grandpa is no longer here.
He is gone.

925
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:26,790
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Let's go.

926
00:52:26,870 --> 00:52:28,790
Father is not here. He has gone.

927
00:52:28,870 --> 00:52:31,000
No one is here. I am not possessed!

928
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,200
He is getting hyper on purpose.

929
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,820
- Such souls don't give up easily.
- Let's go, uncle.

930
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:37,010
- No, they don't.
- Listen, you have a heavy body.

931
00:52:37,350 --> 00:52:38,700
Be strict with him.

932
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,310
I am not possessed,
why are you hitting me?

933
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:42,530
I will teach you a lesson.
This is not right.

934
00:52:42,610 --> 00:52:45,110
I will teach you a lesson now.

935
00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:46,860
No, uncle.
Stop hitting me with your legs.

936
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:49,640
Babaji, what if he
again demands for Momos?

937
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:53,310
Then keep a hot coal on his tongue.

938
00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:55,310
- Don't fulfil any of this cruel
man's demands. - Grandpa, wait.

939
00:52:55,390 --> 00:52:57,620
- Nikka!
- Get him!

940
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,740
- Grandpa!
- Stop! Wait!

941
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:02,230
Babaji, they are naive.

942
00:53:02,310 --> 00:53:03,910
Please bless them.

943
00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:05,080
He isn't ready for my blessings.

944
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:06,830
He is not at all naive.

945
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:11,050
- Nikka!
- Stop! Stop!

946
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:19,660
"The one who sees
you loses his voice."

947
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:23,650
"It is said that it gets
hold of you if you don't run."

948
00:53:23,730 --> 00:53:27,810
"You just stepped on the
ground and the ground caught fire."

949
00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:31,400
"Keep them behind the veil."

950
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:35,890
"Your eyes are as deadly
as a double-barrelled shotgun."

951
00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:40,470
"Your eyes are as deadly
as a double-barrelled shotgun."

952
00:53:47,890 --> 00:53:49,230
Babaji, we are here
to get a ghost exorcised.

953
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:50,610
Get lost you scoundrels.

954
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:52,450
I get rid of sprains
and not ghosts.

955
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:55,320
If you leave the ghost here
then where will I stay? Get lost!

956
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,900
"She has just come of age."

957
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:59,370
"Her attitude is dangerous."

958
00:53:59,450 --> 00:54:03,460
"The men who are unaffected
by your beauty are indeed strong."

959
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:07,300
"The black veil and pink
dress suits your fair skin."

960
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:11,320
"You are like a bottle of whiskey."

961
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:15,710
"You get the boys high."

962
00:54:15,790 --> 00:54:20,060
"You get the boys high."

963
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:21,780
Put this around your neck.

964
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:23,720
Put the garland.
Give him the Ladoo.

965
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,590
- Here, have the ladoo.
- Have it.

966
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:27,100
- Shall I eat it?
- Eat it.

967
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:28,830
Go ahead and eat it.

968
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:33,650
Grandma is here.

969
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:42,810
Oh my beloved,
leave this kid alone.

970
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:46,090
What is this nonsense?

971
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:48,210
Are you guys fools?
What the hell is this?

972
00:54:48,290 --> 00:54:49,840
You are messing up all relations.

973
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:51,340
Get up, grandma.

974
00:54:51,490 --> 00:54:53,680
He didn't let me sit next
to him when he was young.

975
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:54,990
Why would he let me sit next to
him now, bloody pain in the neck?

976
00:54:55,070 --> 00:54:56,420
These are the rituals.

977
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:59,230
Give the bride's hand
into the bridegroom's hand.

978
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:01,730
Wait, I'll teach you the rituals!

979
00:55:01,810 --> 00:55:03,390
I won't spare you, you impostor!

980
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:05,390
Wait! Let me go!
I'll teach you a lesson.

981
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:07,530
- I won't spare him! I will kill him.
- Don't kill him.

982
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:10,150
Wait, you..

983
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:12,800
Wait, you.. One minute!

984
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,560
He isn't going anywhere.

985
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,310
He's here to trouble us.

986
00:55:16,390 --> 00:55:17,870
I assure you.

987
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:35,090
"She has hair extensions
longer than a snake."

988
00:55:35,170 --> 00:55:39,110
"She leaves them breathless,
the one she looks at."

989
00:55:39,190 --> 00:55:43,440
"She has each and every
boy under her control."

990
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:47,390
"Everyone's talking about.."

991
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:51,530
"They are talking about finding
a cure for the spells you cast."

992
00:55:51,610 --> 00:55:55,580
"They are talking about finding
a cure for the spells you cast."

993
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:59,630
"They are talking about finding
a cure for the spells you cast."

994
00:55:59,710 --> 00:56:04,730
"They are talking about finding
a cure for the spells you cast."

995
00:56:04,810 --> 00:56:05,980
Brother?

996
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:10,050
Are you Nikka or are you grandpa?

997
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:12,660
- I think he is grandpa.
- Yes.

998
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:13,800
Tell us!

999
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,070
- Get lost!
- Oh, no..

1000
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:16,930
Grandma,
he is possessed by grandpa.

1001
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:20,000
Look, the Babajis
will do what they can do.

1002
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:23,650
I think you should get
him medically treated as well.

1003
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:27,310
Heed my advice,
and administer electric shocks.

1004
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:42,990
Grandma!

1005
00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:46,030
- Dear, please drop me home.
- Sure.

1006
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:47,580
Very good.

1007
00:56:59,690 --> 00:57:01,810
- Hold him down. Hold him down.
- Be careful!

1008
00:57:01,890 --> 00:57:03,900
Hold him down. Hold him down.

1009
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:05,570
- Don't make me kill you.
- Hold him down.

1010
00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:07,160
Go ahead, doctor.

1011
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:09,120
Go on, go on.

1012
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,200
- Hold him down.
- Careful!

1013
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,580
Oh damn, uncle is back.

1014
00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:17,100
Madam, I have done
what you'd asked me to do.

1015
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:19,690
Thank you, Mr. Jasbir.

1016
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:20,890
Are you sure?

1017
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:22,660
Don't worry, madam.

1018
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:24,590
We won't restore the power
back of that place till night.

1019
00:57:25,450 --> 00:57:26,260
Okay.

1020
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:29,870
Oh thank you, Babaji.

1021
00:57:46,570 --> 00:57:48,010
We have been waiting
for seven hours.

1022
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:49,330
When will they restore the power?

1023
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:51,940
Start the generator and
get the job done, doctor.

1024
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:53,730
Generator isn't working, sir.

1025
00:57:53,810 --> 00:57:54,780
- There you go.
- There you go.

1026
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:57,310
We will need to take him
to another Baba now.

1027
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:58,650
Aunt?
- Yes?

1028
00:57:58,730 --> 00:58:00,860
You shouldn't be superstitious.

1029
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:02,930
He is Nikka.

1030
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,870
And he is not possessed.

1031
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:06,380
He is small.

1032
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:09,290
- But the enemy inside him is very big.
- Yes.

1033
00:58:09,370 --> 00:58:11,140
We burnt 5 quintals of wood.

1034
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:13,180
And yet he is living inside him.

1035
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:18,780
Our work would have been
done if not for that power cut.

1036
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:19,950
Right.

1037
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:23,430
Grandpa, did the doctor give
an electric shock to the old man?

1038
00:58:23,510 --> 00:58:25,270
He was useless.

1039
00:58:25,350 --> 00:58:26,910
He didn't know anything.

1040
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:28,880
He said he is not possessed
by the old man.

1041
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,260
Who is he possessed
by if not the old man?

1042
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:36,530
Listen, why don't we give him
an electric shock at home?

1043
00:58:36,910 --> 00:58:38,050
It's very simple.

1044
00:58:38,130 --> 00:58:40,100
We will join the wires
and throw them on him.

1045
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:41,220
Yes, grandma.

1046
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:42,600
No, mother.

1047
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,300
Please don't do that.
My son will die.

1048
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:46,490
That's a good idea too.

1049
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:49,420
Let's kill him.
We'll get rid of the trouble.

1050
00:58:49,730 --> 00:58:51,540
There is no shortage
of men in our house.

1051
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:53,580
There are too many to count.

1052
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:55,230
You never know the enemy.

1053
00:58:55,310 --> 00:58:56,890
What if he kills
everyone one by one?

1054
00:58:56,970 --> 00:58:58,370
Didn't you see what
happened to Mangal?

1055
00:58:58,450 --> 00:59:01,180
I beg to you mother,
spare my son's life.

1056
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:02,870
I am not a fool.

1057
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:05,630
Grandsons are always
dearer than sons.

1058
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:08,580
I am saying this
with a heavy heart.

1059
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:11,330
Mother, why kill him?

1060
00:59:11,410 --> 00:59:12,590
He is my nephew after all.

1061
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:15,400
You will get an extra
10 acres of land.

1062
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:18,260
I'll give his share
of land to all of you.

1063
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:20,420
- No, mother.
- No, uncle. No.

1064
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:25,440
How can sons say
no to their mother?

1065
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:29,760
- God said it so let's do it.
- Hold him.

1066
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,250
What are you guys
discussing out there?

1067
00:59:32,830 --> 00:59:34,590
Hear me out.

1068
00:59:47,710 --> 00:59:49,500
Don't worry, aunt.

1069
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:51,350
He won't even feel the current.

1070
01:00:00,270 --> 01:00:02,390
- Here my boy, have it.
- What is it, grandma?

1071
01:00:02,470 --> 01:00:04,910
It's mango shake, come on have it.

1072
01:00:04,990 --> 01:00:06,850
Which idiot grew mangoes in winter?

1073
01:00:06,930 --> 01:00:08,020
- I won't have it. Take it away.
- Hold him down.

1074
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:09,900
I won't have it. Take it away.

1075
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:10,970
Let me go!

1076
01:00:11,050 --> 01:00:12,870
No! No, grandma! Grandma!

1077
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:15,070
Please share the video.

1078
01:00:15,150 --> 01:00:17,620
This is gramps final journey.
You will never see him again.

1079
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:19,260
But let me show
it to you live today.

1080
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:22,270
Gramps family has
gathered around him.

1081
01:00:22,350 --> 01:00:24,180
- Come on friends, we are live.
- No grandma, let him go.

1082
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:26,010
We will all go to jail
if anything happens to him.

1083
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:27,310
That idiot has gone
live on the internet.

1084
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:29,250
- Gramps won't come back!
- Bloody idiot!

1085
01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:30,780
Grandma!

1086
01:00:36,010 --> 01:00:38,010
Brother, they will exorcise
gramps' ghost out of you.

1087
01:00:38,090 --> 01:00:39,510
What will they exorcise out of me?

1088
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:40,860
The artist.

1089
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:20,660
Here, drink it.

1090
01:01:22,010 --> 01:01:27,200
Do you remember,
when Makhan got married..

1091
01:01:27,490 --> 01:01:29,900
..I sang for you.

1092
01:01:30,930 --> 01:01:33,290
We were newly married back then.

1093
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:37,150
You didn't like
to go to the fields.

1094
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:39,810
You used to make
excuses and come home.

1095
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:42,450
You used to love me a lot.

1096
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:47,340
Now place your hand on your heart
and tell me, don't you love me at all?

1097
01:01:47,420 --> 01:01:49,940
What are you saying, grandma?

1098
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:51,290
I am feeling shy.

1099
01:01:51,370 --> 01:01:53,350
You stupid, you are my husband.

1100
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:57,340
I have done more work for
you than the hair on my head.

1101
01:01:57,420 --> 01:01:59,940
You never let me rest in peace.

1102
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:03,480
I beg to you, my enemy.
Please go away.

1103
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:05,390
Grandma, I am Nikka.

1104
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:08,400
I will take you to bad Babas.

1105
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:12,640
Aunt, let's take him
to the Chimtewale Baba.

1106
01:02:12,850 --> 01:02:15,270
- No grandma, take me to the Pizza Baba.
- Wait, you scoundrel!

1107
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:16,990
I'll get you pizza.

1108
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:22,470
'Hail to Baba Tong.'

1109
01:02:22,550 --> 01:02:24,110
- Hold him.
- Hail to the Baba!

1110
01:02:24,190 --> 01:02:25,420
Come on.

1111
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:27,380
- Hold him.
- Let go!

1112
01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:29,510
Let me go!

1113
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:32,950
Go on! Go on!

1114
01:02:33,030 --> 01:02:35,090
Let me go!

1115
01:02:35,590 --> 01:02:40,650
You have done many miracles, Baba.

1116
01:02:41,650 --> 01:02:42,550
Let me go!

1117
01:02:42,630 --> 01:02:44,990
You have helped many, Baba.

1118
01:02:46,510 --> 01:02:47,700
Stop!

1119
01:02:47,850 --> 01:02:51,100
Bless us Babaji.

1120
01:02:53,330 --> 01:02:54,850
Tell me, who are you?

1121
01:02:55,660 --> 01:02:58,460
I won't leave him! Try your best!

1122
01:03:00,230 --> 01:03:01,450
This is your last warning.

1123
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:06,210
You will later beg to
leave and I won't let you go.

1124
01:03:06,290 --> 01:03:10,910
I'll lock you in a bottle
and bury 10 feet underground.

1125
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:12,830
Tell me!

1126
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:16,280
Don't do this drama
and tell me your name.

1127
01:03:18,350 --> 01:03:20,340
Beat him with the tongs.

1128
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:21,630
Come on!

1129
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:36,640
"There she surrenders!"

1130
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:38,540
"Spare me, Oh Baba!"

1131
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:40,270
"There she surrenders!"

1132
01:03:40,350 --> 01:03:43,890
- "Spare me, Oh Baba!"
- Tell me, who are you?

1133
01:03:43,970 --> 01:03:47,440
- I am his wife. Sukhchan Kaur.
- Hail the Baba!

1134
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,320
Why have you possessed
your husband?

1135
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:50,810
Why don't you leave?

1136
01:03:50,890 --> 01:03:53,410
- So much love?
- It's not love.

1137
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:57,170
He will marry someone
else if I let him go.

1138
01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:01,440
I won't let him
leave a peaceful life.

1139
01:04:29,590 --> 01:04:31,450
You cannot escape.

1140
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:32,450
Who are you?

1141
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:35,030
Dimple.

1142
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:38,200
The Chimtewale Babaji is my father.

1143
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:41,320
There is nothing wrong with me.
Please let me go.

1144
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,020
Relax.

1145
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:54,480
I know there is
nothing wrong with you.

1146
01:04:54,860 --> 01:04:57,150
There is nothing special
about my dad either.

1147
01:04:57,610 --> 01:04:59,740
It's his business.

1148
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:02,020
People believe in him.

1149
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:06,570
But this isn't the
path you should choose.

1150
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:08,240
Where will you run to?

1151
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:09,280
To your house?

1152
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:11,490
They will bring you back here.

1153
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:15,200
Then dad will use the
tongs on you more freely.

1154
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:17,280
There is really
nothing wrong with me.

1155
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:18,410
I swear.

1156
01:05:19,530 --> 01:05:21,950
I promise by this tree.
I am absolutely fine.

1157
01:05:22,610 --> 01:05:23,740
I know.

1158
01:05:24,530 --> 01:05:26,740
You are such a beautiful soul.

1159
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:31,450
A look at you is enough
to know how good you are at heart.

1160
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:33,530
You don't need to do anything.

1161
01:05:33,610 --> 01:05:36,910
Just go in there and touch
dad's feet in front of everyone.

1162
01:05:36,990 --> 01:05:38,450
He won't do anything to you.

1163
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:40,990
One more thing.

1164
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:45,820
If you need anything
then approach me.

1165
01:05:45,990 --> 01:05:47,450
I will help you.

1166
01:05:47,530 --> 01:05:48,910
Okay?

1167
01:05:52,530 --> 01:05:54,820
'You stink worse
than the cattle do.'

1168
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:57,950
Do you think that I smell bad?

1169
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:02,200
Flowers are always fragrant.

1170
01:06:06,570 --> 01:06:07,910
Carry on.

1171
01:06:14,490 --> 01:06:16,530
Babaji, ask him to drink less.

1172
01:06:16,610 --> 01:06:18,160
He doesn't drink.

1173
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:20,910
The one who has
possessed him drinks.

1174
01:06:21,950 --> 01:06:24,280
Offer an offering of 51,000.

1175
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:25,240
And he will get better.

1176
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:27,860
Babaji, I will be able to
give 51,000 only after the harvest.

1177
01:06:28,110 --> 01:06:30,910
Fine, first take care of
your wheat and then come back.

1178
01:06:30,990 --> 01:06:32,030
Then I will cure him.

1179
01:06:32,110 --> 01:06:33,030
Come on, let's go.

1180
01:06:33,110 --> 01:06:34,780
- I don't want to.
- Why don't you want to?

1181
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:36,200
Leave me.

1182
01:06:36,540 --> 01:06:38,610
Come on, stand up.

1183
01:06:39,790 --> 01:06:42,160
Move aside.
Grandpa! Uncle, grandpa ran away!

1184
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:43,070
- Uncle, grandpa is gone.
- What happened?

1185
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:44,410
- Babaji!
- Father is gone?

1186
01:06:44,490 --> 01:06:45,820
Nikka is back. Nikka is back.

1187
01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:46,950
- Babaji!
- Nikka is back.

1188
01:06:47,030 --> 01:06:48,610
- He is back. Nikka..
- Hail to the Baba!

1189
01:06:48,690 --> 01:06:50,200
Grandpa is going away, there he is.

1190
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:51,240
He is gone.

1191
01:06:52,030 --> 01:06:55,530
Did you see your father leave?

1192
01:06:55,610 --> 01:06:57,820
No. I didn't see him leave.

1193
01:06:59,470 --> 01:07:01,990
- I saw him.
- I too saw him.

1194
01:07:02,070 --> 01:07:03,740
He came out from Nikka
left's ear and went there.

1195
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:04,780
Yes, Babaji.

1196
01:07:04,860 --> 01:07:07,160
He came out of Nikka, he fell,
he dusted his clothes and ran away.

1197
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:08,410
Uncle, he must have
gone to relieve himself.

1198
01:07:08,490 --> 01:07:10,360
Shall we take some water for him?

1199
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:13,280
Did you see the miracle
Babaji just performed?

1200
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:16,330
All say hail to Chimtewale Babaji.

1201
01:07:16,410 --> 01:07:18,530
All say hail to Chimtewale Babaji.

1202
01:07:18,610 --> 01:07:20,610
"There she surrenders!"

1203
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:22,660
"Spare me, Oh Baba!"

1204
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:24,570
"There she surrenders!"

1205
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:27,030
"Spare me, Oh Baba!"

1206
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:44,990
Listen to me..

1207
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:47,450
Be careful.

1208
01:07:48,410 --> 01:07:50,360
Hail to the Baba!

1209
01:07:56,860 --> 01:07:58,360
How much should we
offer prayers worth?

1210
01:07:59,570 --> 01:08:00,490
100,000?

1211
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:02,200
100,000.

1212
01:08:04,110 --> 01:08:05,700
Here you go, 100,000.

1213
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:07,360
Counting them isn't auspicious.

1214
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:09,450
Something worth millions
was done by him for mere thousands.

1215
01:08:09,530 --> 01:08:11,570
Okay. Hail to the Baba!

1216
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:14,070
Hail to the Baba!

1217
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:16,360
Babaji, always be this generous.

1218
01:08:32,490 --> 01:08:34,110
Hello, Ambo.

1219
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:35,570
Hello, brother.

1220
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:37,110
Is Nikka doing well, sister?

1221
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:39,660
Bullshit. Nikka is doing well.

1222
01:08:39,820 --> 01:08:41,610
You don't listen to them.

1223
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:43,360
Your husband didn't leave, Ambo?

1224
01:08:43,450 --> 01:08:44,950
He left, brother.

1225
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:46,820
They say that he left.

1226
01:08:46,910 --> 01:08:49,070
He gave me the keys.

1227
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:51,200
He was here to trouble
us like a deadly snake.

1228
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:52,360
- Really?
- Have some tea.

1229
01:08:52,450 --> 01:08:55,360
You should have shot
the snake, mother.

1230
01:08:55,450 --> 01:08:58,610
He would have danced
to your tunes then.

1231
01:08:58,700 --> 01:08:59,910
Get lost.

1232
01:09:00,070 --> 01:09:01,990
Your daughter is so good.

1233
01:09:02,070 --> 01:09:03,820
Why do you act like crazy?

1234
01:09:03,990 --> 01:09:07,570
Stop this stupidity
and behave yourself.

1235
01:09:07,660 --> 01:09:09,780
- You know what he told me last night?
- What?

1236
01:09:09,860 --> 01:09:12,950
He said Shanti,
let me drink through your eyes.

1237
01:09:14,820 --> 01:09:16,860
And he is back.

1238
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:20,110
Nikka, what you said about drinking
last night, it's true, right?

1239
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:22,660
Yes, my thirst quenched
after drinking it.

1240
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:29,950
'Come on, I was thirsty.'

1241
01:09:30,110 --> 01:09:31,280
'I asked sister-in-law
to get me some water.'

1242
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:32,860
'Why would I lie about it?'

1243
01:09:41,570 --> 01:09:43,740
Hey, hello!

1244
01:09:45,450 --> 01:09:47,530
Look, I am still waiting for you.

1245
01:09:47,610 --> 01:09:48,740
Say yes now.

1246
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:53,030
If you ever try to stop me again,
then look at these slippers.

1247
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:56,530
I'll beat all the kings
and emperors out of you.

1248
01:09:57,410 --> 01:09:59,450
You stinky fellow.
Stay away from me.

1249
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:14,070
'Flowers are always fragrant.'

1250
01:10:30,070 --> 01:10:33,160
- Grandma, grandpa has
possessed me again. - Really?

1251
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:35,890
I saw him enter
me through my navel.

1252
01:10:35,970 --> 01:10:37,450
You should take me back
to the Chimtewale Baba.

1253
01:10:37,610 --> 01:10:40,610
They said he left
through your ears.

1254
01:10:40,910 --> 01:10:44,450
My husband isn't
so strong to come here.

1255
01:10:44,530 --> 01:10:46,070
Don't worry. Go to sleep.

1256
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:47,610
Everyone go to sleep.

1257
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:48,740
You keep talking till late hours.

1258
01:10:48,820 --> 01:10:50,410
And then you refuse
to wake up in the morning.

1259
01:10:54,410 --> 01:10:55,740
Give me the bag.

1260
01:10:57,280 --> 01:11:01,110
- Stop, stop, stop.
- I will show this photo to grandma.

1261
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:04,200
Grandma, this is my sister.
She is beautiful, isn't she?

1262
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:07,240
Yes dear, she is very sweet.

1263
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:09,570
She is short puppy like ears.

1264
01:11:09,780 --> 01:11:10,860
Nikka!

1265
01:11:10,950 --> 01:11:12,110
Come here.

1266
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:13,740
Come, I'll show
you your future wife.

1267
01:11:14,610 --> 01:11:15,820
Come on.

1268
01:11:16,570 --> 01:11:17,620
He is feeling shy.

1269
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:18,950
Come here, son.

1270
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:21,360
Look at this.

1271
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:22,700
What do you say?

1272
01:11:23,070 --> 01:11:24,240
She's fat, grandma.

1273
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:25,780
She is healthy.

1274
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:27,200
She will work well.

1275
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:29,740
It's not like you want to expose her
stomach and make her act in movies.

1276
01:11:30,610 --> 01:11:34,700
Hey girl, go and tell your
mother that the lioness likes her.

1277
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:36,240
We shouldn't worry about
the cats and the dogs here.

1278
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:37,780
Go and tell your mother
to start making preparations.

1279
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:38,780
Okay, grandma.

1280
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:41,280
Go and work with your father.

1281
01:11:43,410 --> 01:11:44,780
Go away.

1282
01:11:44,950 --> 01:11:46,570
Hello? Yes, mummy?

1283
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:48,360
Everything is fixed.

1284
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:51,070
Yes, he will be
back for the wedding.

1285
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:52,490
Why will he come back?

1286
01:11:53,060 --> 01:11:53,990
Let him stay abroad.

1287
01:11:54,180 --> 01:11:55,740
And let your sister
stay where she is.

1288
01:11:57,740 --> 01:11:59,070
I'll marry you.

1289
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:01,450
And I'll also buy you
colourful mosquito nets.

1290
01:12:03,030 --> 01:12:05,410
Old infested old man! You are back!

1291
01:12:05,490 --> 01:12:06,450
Get lost.

1292
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:12,970
- Grandma, grandpa is back!
- He come back!

1293
01:12:13,050 --> 01:12:14,740
Grandma, grandpa is back!

1294
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:17,160
Wait.. where are you going, Shanti?

1295
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:20,240
Wait, let me put the sheet on you.
What's the big deal.

1296
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:21,910
I'll tell you what's the big deal.

1297
01:12:21,990 --> 01:12:23,240
Are you going to
behave or should I..

1298
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:24,410
Get lost, fatso.

1299
01:12:24,490 --> 01:12:25,990
- Father?
- Grandpa is back.

1300
01:12:26,070 --> 01:12:27,610
Give me the keys back, Dilipo.

1301
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:29,160
I'll set everything on fire.

1302
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:31,530
I am a lion.
A lion will do as he pleases.

1303
01:12:31,610 --> 01:12:32,820
I will eat momos.

1304
01:12:32,910 --> 01:12:35,360
Everyone, get this straight.
I will also have pizza.

1305
01:12:35,490 --> 01:12:37,570
And do not take me
to the Chimtewale Baba.

1306
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:39,780
You can take me
anywhere else you want.

1307
01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:41,030
I don't care.

1308
01:12:41,110 --> 01:12:42,360
This troublemaker is back.

1309
01:12:42,450 --> 01:12:44,070
- What do you think..!
- Father!

1310
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:47,570
Wait, I'll teach you a lesson.

1311
01:12:47,650 --> 01:12:49,590
'Flowers are always fragrant.'

1312
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:54,070
All say hail to Chimtewale Babaji.

1313
01:12:54,650 --> 01:13:00,450
Chant in your heart
the name of Babaji.

1314
01:13:00,530 --> 01:13:03,030
Babaji! Babaji!

1315
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:04,950
- Stop.
- Babaji! Babaji!

1316
01:13:05,030 --> 01:13:06,950
You know everything. Babaji!

1317
01:13:07,030 --> 01:13:08,200
- Enough.
- Babaji!

1318
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:10,280
Great soul, keep me with you.

1319
01:13:10,490 --> 01:13:12,660
I get possessed by
my grandpa when I go home.

1320
01:13:12,740 --> 01:13:16,200
You are omnipresent.
Let me stay at your feet, Babaji.

1321
01:13:17,110 --> 01:13:18,860
Make him one of the helpers.

1322
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:20,530
You too stay with him.

1323
01:13:20,610 --> 01:13:21,700
Okay, Babaji.

1324
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:35,210
Hail to the Baba!

1325
01:13:35,290 --> 01:13:36,700
Hail to the great soul!

1326
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:39,620
You love the poor and the lovers.

1327
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:41,160
Hail to the Baba!

1328
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:42,410
Hail to the Baba!

1329
01:13:42,700 --> 01:13:45,490
Hey, mend your ways.

1330
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:48,190
Hail to the Baba!

1331
01:13:48,270 --> 01:13:49,200
Hail to the Baba!

1332
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:50,800
Hail to the great soul!

1333
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:54,860
"I'll buy you a mini cooper."

1334
01:13:54,950 --> 01:13:58,280
"You can go on rides
whenever you want."

1335
01:13:58,360 --> 01:13:59,930
Do some work.

1336
01:14:00,010 --> 01:14:01,360
Why does it hurt you?

1337
01:14:01,490 --> 01:14:02,490
I won't go to work.

1338
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:04,410
You don't know the Jatts.

1339
01:14:04,570 --> 01:14:07,380
I can earn one year's
wages through my shoulder.

1340
01:14:07,460 --> 01:14:08,990
You don't know the Jatts.

1341
01:14:09,070 --> 01:14:10,730
They don't let you sit idle.

1342
01:14:10,810 --> 01:14:15,110
Collect the dung,
feed them fodder, sweep the floor.

1343
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:16,530
Wash the tractor.

1344
01:14:16,610 --> 01:14:19,450
They order me around
like I am their servant.

1345
01:14:19,530 --> 01:14:21,300
They give me 125,000 a year.

1346
01:14:21,380 --> 01:14:23,170
And they squeeze even the
last drop of life out of me.

1347
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:25,710
If you pull a raddish
out of their field by mistake..

1348
01:14:25,790 --> 01:14:29,070
..forget the men even the
women will try to strangle you.

1349
01:14:29,150 --> 01:14:31,890
And they will pay the
agents any money the ask for.

1350
01:14:31,970 --> 01:14:36,530
Give a small push and
they will showering money.

1351
01:14:37,110 --> 01:14:37,950
Anyway forget it.

1352
01:14:38,030 --> 01:14:39,320
Come here, my sweetheart.

1353
01:14:39,510 --> 01:14:42,240
Let's make a video on tiktok.

1354
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:44,160
Come on. Come here, my sweetheart.

1355
01:14:45,450 --> 01:14:52,210
"My heart isn't that cheap
that you can buy it with a wink."

1356
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:56,070
You sit here, I'll go
and get 10,000 from grandma.

1357
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:56,990
Okay?

1358
01:14:57,070 --> 01:15:01,200
Grandma,
Nikka has made me handicap.

1359
01:15:02,170 --> 01:15:05,360
My shoulder dislocates
as easily as a doorknob moves.

1360
01:15:05,450 --> 01:15:07,990
I am as good as dead, grandma.

1361
01:15:08,820 --> 01:15:12,200
Grandma, I cannot even
lift a basket anymore.

1362
01:15:12,780 --> 01:15:15,910
No one will hire me now.

1363
01:15:15,990 --> 01:15:18,700
I have 5-7 kids.
I will die of starvation.

1364
01:15:20,030 --> 01:15:22,910
I am become useless.

1365
01:15:23,030 --> 01:15:25,030
Don't cry, go release the bull.

1366
01:15:25,110 --> 01:15:26,240
You have lost your mind..

1367
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:28,320
..from the time you started wearing
bells around your feet.

1368
01:15:28,410 --> 01:15:29,280
You are strange.

1369
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:32,820
How can I release a bull when I
cannot even release my drawstrings?

1370
01:15:32,910 --> 01:15:39,240
Grandma, do one thing, give me
some money and ask me to get lost.

1371
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:40,910
Damn you!

1372
01:15:40,990 --> 01:15:43,860
Major, give him 2000
and ask him to leave.

1373
01:15:43,950 --> 01:15:45,740
I think you have lost your mind.

1374
01:15:45,820 --> 01:15:46,820
2000 rupees?

1375
01:15:46,910 --> 01:15:50,490
I want to get my shoulder
treated and not buy anklets.

1376
01:15:50,570 --> 01:15:54,660
Zaildar,
at least give me 10,000 rupees.

1377
01:15:54,740 --> 01:15:56,740
Have you forgotten
that you are Zaildars?

1378
01:15:56,820 --> 01:15:58,360
- Major!
- Yes, mother?

1379
01:15:58,450 --> 01:16:01,610
Give him 10,000 rupees
and get rid of him.

1380
01:16:01,700 --> 01:16:05,280
- Long live Zaildarni!
- Get lost!

1381
01:16:05,530 --> 01:16:07,450
- Long live Zaildarni!
- Leave.

1382
01:16:07,530 --> 01:16:09,280
- Let's go, Mangal. I'll give
you the money. - Okay.

1383
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:10,660
Ouch!

1384
01:16:33,530 --> 01:16:35,910
Chimtewale Baba is great.

1385
01:16:36,570 --> 01:16:38,700
What are you doing here?
Go and wash the utensils.

1386
01:16:41,070 --> 01:16:42,660
I like her.

1387
01:16:43,860 --> 01:16:45,360
I like her too.

1388
01:16:47,410 --> 01:16:48,860
I like her before you.

1389
01:16:48,950 --> 01:16:50,240
I like her from the first day.

1390
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:51,990
Get lost. Go and wash utensils.

1391
01:16:53,860 --> 01:16:55,280
Nikka..

1392
01:16:55,700 --> 01:16:56,950
You'll get infested with worms.

1393
01:16:58,030 --> 01:17:00,200
Oh no!

1394
01:17:00,910 --> 01:17:02,030
What?

1395
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:04,570
I thought you hurt
yourself with the scissors.

1396
01:17:05,820 --> 01:17:11,160
No, it's your eyes that
have pierced through my heart.

1397
01:17:15,660 --> 01:17:18,570
If I was crazy, I wouldn't
go crazy after seeing you.

1398
01:17:19,610 --> 01:17:21,780
I too like you.

1399
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:25,280
Can I hold your hand?

1400
01:17:26,530 --> 01:17:28,910
Forget my hand you
can also hold my ankle.

1401
01:17:29,660 --> 01:17:31,660
Now I am all yours, my love.

1402
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:54,700
"Got trapped when you looked at me,
this simple naive Jatt."

1403
01:17:54,780 --> 01:18:00,320
"Everything seems beautiful now,
he keeps twisting his moustaches."

1404
01:18:00,410 --> 01:18:03,280
"He has loudspeakers
on his terrace now."

1405
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:06,030
"You better watch out girl."

1406
01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:11,240
"Tell me, what did you like?"

1407
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:14,070
"The boy or his nature?"

1408
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:16,740
"I dance on my terrace."

1409
01:18:16,820 --> 01:18:19,990
"I am so excited."

1410
01:18:20,070 --> 01:18:22,360
"Tell me, what did you like?"

1411
01:18:22,450 --> 01:18:26,030
"The boy or his nature?"

1412
01:18:36,030 --> 01:18:38,740
"You have started blushing."

1413
01:18:38,820 --> 01:18:41,580
"It is a sight to watch out for."

1414
01:18:41,660 --> 01:18:44,280
"He will fulfil all your wishes."

1415
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:47,110
"That's why he has started
saving every penny."

1416
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:49,860
"You have started blushing."

1417
01:18:49,950 --> 01:18:52,610
"It is a sight to watch out for."

1418
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:55,330
"He will fulfil all your wishes."

1419
01:18:55,410 --> 01:18:58,200
"That's why he has started
saving every penny."

1420
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:04,080
"With each breath
I take your name."

1421
01:19:06,530 --> 01:19:09,200
"Tell me, what did you like?"

1422
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:11,990
"The boy or his nature?"

1423
01:19:12,070 --> 01:19:14,660
"I dance on my terrace."

1424
01:19:14,740 --> 01:19:17,860
"I am so excited."

1425
01:19:17,950 --> 01:19:20,240
"Tell me, what did you like?"

1426
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:23,950
"The boy or his nature?"

1427
01:19:33,990 --> 01:19:39,450
"The words you say
are sweeter than honey."

1428
01:19:39,530 --> 01:19:44,910
"Even sun isn't bright enough
against your bright clothes."

1429
01:19:44,990 --> 01:19:50,610
"The words you say
are sweeter than honey."

1430
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:56,160
"Even sun isn't bright enough
against your bright clothes."

1431
01:19:56,240 --> 01:20:02,070
"The path to your village
seems more beautiful than heaven."

1432
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:07,200
"Tell me, what did you like?"

1433
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:09,910
"The boy or his nature?"

1434
01:20:09,990 --> 01:20:12,610
"I dance on my terrace."

1435
01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:15,740
"I am so excited."

1436
01:20:15,820 --> 01:20:18,160
"Tell me, what did you like?"

1437
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:21,380
"The boy or his nature?"

1438
01:20:21,460 --> 01:20:23,630
"I dance on my terrace."

1439
01:20:23,710 --> 01:20:26,410
"I am so excited."

1440
01:20:26,490 --> 01:20:29,150
"Tell me, what did you like?"

1441
01:20:29,230 --> 01:20:32,710
"The boy or his nature?"

1442
01:20:45,660 --> 01:20:47,530
- Listen?
- Yes?

1443
01:20:47,610 --> 01:20:50,410
Tell me something, are you possessed
or are you doing a drama like me?

1444
01:20:50,490 --> 01:20:52,110
Help me out as well.

1445
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:54,200
Ask her if she has a single aunt.

1446
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:56,070
Have some shame.
Look at your age first.

1447
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:57,240
Why should I feel ashamed?

1448
01:20:57,320 --> 01:20:59,110
I became a widower at a young age.

1449
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:00,820
My relatives didn't let me remarry.

1450
01:21:00,910 --> 01:21:02,360
What else am I supposed to do?

1451
01:21:02,450 --> 01:21:04,030
Be a good brother and help me out.

1452
01:21:04,110 --> 01:21:06,360
- Get lost. Stop troubling me.
- Oh really?

1453
01:21:06,660 --> 01:21:07,660
Now you wait and watch.

1454
01:21:07,740 --> 01:21:10,280
People, he's eloping
with Baba's daughter!

1455
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:11,740
Look at this, Baba!

1456
01:21:11,820 --> 01:21:14,280
He's going after your family.

1457
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:17,910
He has gone crazy!
He wants to ruin your life.

1458
01:21:17,990 --> 01:21:20,860
Yes, surround him! Surround him!
Get him! Get him!

1459
01:21:20,940 --> 01:21:22,450
No, no, no.
- Yes.

1460
01:21:22,530 --> 01:21:24,160
Get him.

1461
01:21:24,610 --> 01:21:26,660
Now you will learn a lesson.

1462
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:45,570
I suspected you when you
said that I am omnipresent.

1463
01:21:45,740 --> 01:21:47,320
Babaji..

1464
01:21:49,740 --> 01:21:51,570
My grandpa has
saved a lot of money.

1465
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:52,660
I want to get married.

1466
01:21:52,740 --> 01:21:56,320
Please don't beat me up.
I like your daughter.

1467
01:22:00,570 --> 01:22:02,740
'I don't think he's a bad boy.'

1468
01:22:03,450 --> 01:22:05,410
'He is from a good family too.'

1469
01:22:05,490 --> 01:22:07,950
'He also has wealth and property.'

1470
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:11,410
'He is perfect for Dimple.'

1471
01:22:11,780 --> 01:22:15,850
'My daughter will
rule his household.'

1472
01:22:42,450 --> 01:22:44,910
There is only one way to cure him.

1473
01:22:44,990 --> 01:22:46,360
Get him married.

1474
01:22:46,450 --> 01:22:50,360
The soul will leave
the body after the wedding.

1475
01:22:50,450 --> 01:22:54,160
Babaji, Shanti wants her
younger sister to marry him.

1476
01:23:03,660 --> 01:23:05,030
It's difficult.

1477
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:06,660
It's very difficult.

1478
01:23:06,740 --> 01:23:10,410
It is possible that the
girl dies after the wedding.

1479
01:23:11,450 --> 01:23:14,240
No grandma,
I won't let my sister marry him.

1480
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:16,330
Babaji said she can die.

1481
01:23:16,410 --> 01:23:19,610
Why should I sacrifice
my sister for that cruel old man?

1482
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:21,450
I am not going
to let her marry him.

1483
01:23:21,530 --> 01:23:22,660
Come on.

1484
01:23:23,070 --> 01:23:25,990
Guide us, oh great soul.

1485
01:23:27,070 --> 01:23:28,820
Show them the right path.

1486
01:23:28,910 --> 01:23:30,780
Who will let his
daughter marry him?

1487
01:23:30,950 --> 01:23:33,490
He has got a bad
name in the village.

1488
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:36,530
I will sacrifice my daughter.

1489
01:23:39,110 --> 01:23:43,860
This isn't a bed of roses,
it's a bed of thorns.

1490
01:23:44,660 --> 01:23:46,660
It is very easy
to be called a Baba.

1491
01:23:46,740 --> 01:23:48,410
But it is difficult to be one.

1492
01:23:48,490 --> 01:23:51,820
I am here to help
the mankind, Charna.

1493
01:23:51,910 --> 01:23:53,110
It's true.

1494
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:54,950
I'll get my daughter
married to him.

1495
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:56,910
- Go, you have been blessed.
- Congratulations, aunt.

1496
01:23:56,990 --> 01:23:59,910
All say hail to Chimtewale Babaji.

1497
01:23:59,990 --> 01:24:01,660
He is so lucky.

1498
01:24:02,030 --> 01:24:04,030
Even I would like
grandpa to possess me.

1499
01:24:04,110 --> 01:24:05,320
Hail!

1500
01:24:05,910 --> 01:24:07,110
'He will die.'

1501
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:11,820
"Chimtewala Babaji
gets rid of our worries."

1502
01:24:11,910 --> 01:24:13,360
'This is what the Baba wanted.'

1503
01:24:13,450 --> 01:24:17,280
"Chimtewala Babaji
shows us the right path."

1504
01:24:17,890 --> 01:24:19,780
We'll wear matching colours, pink.

1505
01:24:20,330 --> 01:24:23,530
You can wear pink lehenga.
I will wear a pink turban.

1506
01:24:23,620 --> 01:24:24,990
Whatever you say.

1507
01:24:25,750 --> 01:24:27,870
I'll do as you say.

1508
01:24:27,950 --> 01:24:29,370
We could go with maroon too.

1509
01:24:29,450 --> 01:24:31,620
I'll wear a Nabhi turban
and you can wear a maroon lehenga.

1510
01:24:31,700 --> 01:24:33,240
You will look beautiful
no matter what you wear.

1511
01:24:33,330 --> 01:24:36,160
You can wear whatever you want.

1512
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:39,490
I am covered in your hues now.

1513
01:24:44,740 --> 01:24:45,740
Nikka?

1514
01:24:55,410 --> 01:24:57,450
We have booked Labh Heera.

1515
01:24:57,530 --> 01:24:58,830
He has taken 80,000 rupees.

1516
01:24:58,910 --> 01:25:00,780
He will rock the party.
You just wait and watch.

1517
01:25:01,990 --> 01:25:05,240
And also write my name
on your palm with henna.

1518
01:25:06,370 --> 01:25:08,030
You cheat!

1519
01:25:08,740 --> 01:25:10,030
Hey!

1520
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:11,240
You?

1521
01:25:13,990 --> 01:25:14,880
It's not my fault.

1522
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:17,030
You didn't listen to
me when I kept following you.

1523
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:18,580
Now you are acting like a victim.

1524
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:21,120
How am I supposed to know when you
are possessed and when you are not?

1525
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:23,410
I cannot marry a ghost, can I?

1526
01:25:23,490 --> 01:25:25,030
I kept writing poetry for you.

1527
01:25:25,780 --> 01:25:29,080
"I didn't know this would happen.."

1528
01:25:29,990 --> 01:25:34,200
"I didn't know this would happen.."

1529
01:25:34,870 --> 01:25:38,910
"After your wedding, I'd wither
away like a flower saddened."

1530
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:43,780
Hey liar,
that's Davinder Kohinoor's song.

1531
01:25:43,910 --> 01:25:45,450
But the feelings are mine.

1532
01:25:46,620 --> 01:25:48,910
I will write our
names on every tree.

1533
01:25:48,990 --> 01:25:50,080
I am begging to you.

1534
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:51,530
Please don't embarrass us.

1535
01:25:51,860 --> 01:25:53,660
Don't ruin our happiness.

1536
01:25:53,740 --> 01:25:55,240
Go away. Nothing can be done now.

1537
01:25:56,450 --> 01:25:57,280
Get lost.

1538
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:09,080
Mummy!

1539
01:26:10,950 --> 01:26:13,620
We have booked Labh Heera.
We will have a lot of fun.

1540
01:26:13,700 --> 01:26:15,870
Forget the singer and
tell me about the catering.

1541
01:26:16,030 --> 01:26:18,030
Catering?
Sangam Caterers from Patiala.

1542
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:18,990
Okay.

1543
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:21,950
But the decoration guys
will come from Chandigarh.

1544
01:26:22,030 --> 01:26:22,910
Hold on.

1545
01:26:28,030 --> 01:26:28,950
Listen..

1546
01:26:29,030 --> 01:26:30,080
What do I listen to?

1547
01:26:30,260 --> 01:26:31,700
We are betrothed.
We are getting married in 10 days.

1548
01:26:31,780 --> 01:26:32,990
We are getting engaged
day after tomorrow. What is it?

1549
01:26:33,390 --> 01:26:35,140
Ghosts are a bad thing.

1550
01:26:35,220 --> 01:26:38,120
There are no ghosts inside me.
I was acting.

1551
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:39,870
Yes, I know. You are not possessed.

1552
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:41,990
But Baba's daughter is possessed.

1553
01:26:49,030 --> 01:26:54,120
'No, it's your eyes that
have pierced through my heart.'

1554
01:27:00,490 --> 01:27:01,660
You swear?

1555
01:27:02,450 --> 01:27:04,450
- Couldn't you tell me any sooner?
- I did warn you.

1556
01:27:04,780 --> 01:27:05,990
Listen to me, listen to me..

1557
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:07,200
Did you listen to me? No.

1558
01:27:08,120 --> 01:27:10,530
Now enjoy ghosts
at a witch's wedding.

1559
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:13,580
Who knows even your
grandpa might show up.

1560
01:27:30,990 --> 01:27:32,410
Here son, exchange the rings.

1561
01:27:33,530 --> 01:27:35,700
- Exchange the rings, son.
- No grandma, I don't want to.

1562
01:27:36,030 --> 01:27:37,330
- Do it, Nikka.
- Do it, son.

1563
01:27:37,410 --> 01:27:38,580
Grandma..

1564
01:27:38,850 --> 01:27:41,490
Nikka, be a good son and sit down.

1565
01:27:45,780 --> 01:27:46,700
Take this.

1566
01:27:46,780 --> 01:27:47,990
I won't do it, grandma.

1567
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:49,240
- I'll slap you.
- Do it.

1568
01:27:49,990 --> 01:27:51,240
- Do it.
- Do it. Do it, Nikka.

1569
01:27:51,330 --> 01:27:52,700
Look over there.

1570
01:27:53,340 --> 01:27:55,530
Nikka, hold her hand.

1571
01:27:55,770 --> 01:27:57,950
She is yours. She isn't a stranger.

1572
01:27:58,030 --> 01:27:59,530
Be a little romantic.

1573
01:28:02,410 --> 01:28:03,990
Nikka, sister-in-law
is so beautiful.

1574
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:06,370
Your feet won't touch the
ground on your wedding night.

1575
01:28:06,950 --> 01:28:07,870
Come closer, dear.

1576
01:28:09,780 --> 01:28:10,770
Do it, son.

1577
01:28:22,580 --> 01:28:24,120
Say something, Nikka..

1578
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:26,580
Have it, dear. Have it.

1579
01:28:27,790 --> 01:28:29,950
- Brother, garland him.
- Here, grandma.

1580
01:28:31,710 --> 01:28:34,330
Good. That's great.

1581
01:28:34,410 --> 01:28:35,450
Wear it, son.

1582
01:28:35,530 --> 01:28:37,700
Look at it.
It's made from currency notes.

1583
01:28:38,230 --> 01:28:40,730
Grandma is putting it wrong.

1584
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:42,810
Congratulations, grandma.

1585
01:28:43,270 --> 01:28:45,350
- There you go. Congratulations!
- Congratulations to everyone!

1586
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:47,100
- Congratulations!
- There you go.

1587
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:50,060
- Congratulations to you too.
- Heartily congratulations!

1588
01:29:27,730 --> 01:29:28,690
Wait. Wait.

1589
01:29:29,270 --> 01:29:30,150
What is it?

1590
01:29:30,940 --> 01:29:34,270
Last night I felt every lamp
that you lit burning my heart.

1591
01:29:35,610 --> 01:29:40,230
Now I have realised who will
be with me, you aren't with me?

1592
01:29:42,250 --> 01:29:43,870
Isn't this that baldie's song?

1593
01:29:46,160 --> 01:29:47,620
But the feelings
are genuinely mine.

1594
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:50,500
I cannot live without you.

1595
01:29:50,650 --> 01:29:51,900
You can go and tell
everyone in your village.

1596
01:29:51,980 --> 01:29:55,070
Write our names on
every tree and every leaf.

1597
01:29:56,360 --> 01:29:58,270
We don't need to fear the world.

1598
01:30:05,480 --> 01:30:07,480
I am touched, Nikka.

1599
01:30:09,850 --> 01:30:11,070
But no.

1600
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:15,900
Now it will be as
God wills it to be.

1601
01:30:16,910 --> 01:30:19,690
Separation is a sign
of true love, Nikka.

1602
01:30:20,370 --> 01:30:24,570
In our hearts, we will
be together till our last breath.

1603
01:30:24,650 --> 01:30:26,610
Our souls love each other.

1604
01:30:30,070 --> 01:30:31,110
No!

1605
01:30:31,190 --> 01:30:32,900
You go for it.
I will handle the rest.

1606
01:30:34,230 --> 01:30:35,110
Let me go.

1607
01:30:37,860 --> 01:30:38,980
No, Nikka.

1608
01:30:39,570 --> 01:30:40,820
I am a woman.

1609
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:45,070
Being a woman,
I cannot ruin another woman's life.

1610
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:47,690
May you lead a happy life.

1611
01:30:48,070 --> 01:30:49,730
Have fun, my love.

1612
01:30:51,230 --> 01:30:52,400
Mummy!

1613
01:30:53,820 --> 01:30:55,150
I don't feel hungry anymore.

1614
01:30:55,820 --> 01:30:57,070
I don't feel thirsty either.

1615
01:30:58,190 --> 01:30:59,730
Oh, come on.

1616
01:31:00,980 --> 01:31:01,900
Brother!

1617
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:04,360
Whether you are grandpa
or Nikka or anyone else.

1618
01:31:04,730 --> 01:31:07,070
- Please spare some for poor guys
like me as well. - Get lost!

1619
01:31:08,360 --> 01:31:09,440
You are grandpa.

1620
01:31:09,650 --> 01:31:10,580
He's after my life.

1621
01:31:32,900 --> 01:31:36,820
All the seven dresses the
girl has stitched are in black.

1622
01:31:37,270 --> 01:31:39,980
Tell me, what colour Sherwani
do you want for the wedding?

1623
01:31:43,480 --> 01:31:44,820
A white one.

1624
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:47,440
And a white shawl too.

1625
01:31:48,070 --> 01:31:50,150
She is a witch,
she is bound to go for black.

1626
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:52,480
I beg to you, say no to them.

1627
01:31:52,570 --> 01:31:54,070
- I don't want to get married.
- Right.

1628
01:31:54,150 --> 01:31:55,230
Hear that.

1629
01:31:55,320 --> 01:31:57,650
You don't know about yourself
and you keep accusing others?

1630
01:31:57,730 --> 01:31:59,150
She is beautiful.

1631
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:00,650
- Just like an angel.
- Here, have it.

1632
01:32:00,940 --> 01:32:03,110
She is possessed! She is no angel.

1633
01:32:03,860 --> 01:32:05,030
Okay, grandpa.

1634
01:32:05,110 --> 01:32:06,730
You two ghosts
can have a good time.

1635
01:32:06,820 --> 01:32:08,610
And these two bodies
will be together. Okay?

1636
01:32:08,690 --> 01:32:10,650
You guys can pair up.

1637
01:32:10,730 --> 01:32:11,610
- Oh no.
- No!

1638
01:32:11,690 --> 01:32:13,360
The enemy is getting hyper again.

1639
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:14,900
He knows he has little time left.

1640
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:16,900
Look at him making excuses.

1641
01:32:16,980 --> 01:32:19,070
- It's okay.
- There are just two days left.

1642
01:32:19,150 --> 01:32:20,320
Have some more fun.

1643
01:32:20,570 --> 01:32:24,650
Baba said you will leave forever
as soon as they get married.

1644
01:32:26,110 --> 01:32:27,260
Where is Shanti?

1645
01:32:28,150 --> 01:32:29,270
Upstairs, grandpa.

1646
01:32:29,730 --> 01:32:31,110
- Wait, I'll teach you a lesson.
- It's okay.

1647
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:33,480
Tease her as much as
you can for the next two days.

1648
01:32:33,570 --> 01:32:35,070
Her husband will be back as well.

1649
01:32:36,690 --> 01:32:38,150
'He is having a good time.'

1650
01:32:38,440 --> 01:32:39,860
'He has Baba's daughter
under his control.'

1651
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:42,690
'He is romancing that
girl with the scooter too.'

1652
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:45,190
'They don't tell him anything
even when he teases sister-in-law.'

1653
01:32:45,730 --> 01:32:46,660
'And I?'

1654
01:32:48,730 --> 01:32:49,610
Hello?

1655
01:32:49,730 --> 01:32:51,190
Yes, mummy. He is coming.

1656
01:32:51,730 --> 01:32:54,070
Yes, he will come soon.

1657
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:55,320
Yes.

1658
01:32:56,020 --> 01:32:57,480
No, I am fine.

1659
01:32:57,570 --> 01:32:59,270
I am not going to
marry anyone, Shanti.

1660
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:00,940
I'll make you my wife.

1661
01:33:01,020 --> 01:33:02,320
I like you.

1662
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:04,360
I am sure. I want Shanti.

1663
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:06,020
May you get infested with worms.

1664
01:33:06,150 --> 01:33:08,070
- Move aside, let me go.
- I won't.

1665
01:33:08,150 --> 01:33:10,070
- Nikka, please, let me go.
- I won't.

1666
01:33:10,150 --> 01:33:11,270
- Nikka, please, let me go.
- Kabaddi! Kabaddi! Kabaddi!

1667
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:13,020
- Nikka, please, don't do this. Please,
let me go. - Kabaddi! Kabaddi! Kabaddi!

1668
01:33:13,110 --> 01:33:14,520
Wait, you..

1669
01:33:14,610 --> 01:33:16,190
Brother! Brother!

1670
01:33:21,230 --> 01:33:23,570
Brother, I was playing Kabaddi.

1671
01:33:23,730 --> 01:33:25,860
Wait, I'll turn you
into Khushi Duggan Wala.

1672
01:33:25,940 --> 01:33:28,270
I kept extracting oil
day in and day out in Qatar..

1673
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:30,320
..and you are trying
to steal away my wife?

1674
01:33:31,110 --> 01:33:32,480
No, brother. No.

1675
01:33:32,570 --> 01:33:36,360
Over there they gouge out the eyes
of those who eye other men's wives.

1676
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:38,480
- I'll teach you a lesson. Wait, you..
- No, no, no. Brother!

1677
01:33:38,570 --> 01:33:40,440
- No, no, no!
- He wants to play Kabaddi.

1678
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:44,480
"Buy me a mosquito net,
these mosquitoes are killing me."

1679
01:33:44,570 --> 01:33:47,610
- "Buy me a mosquito net.."
- Stop it.

1680
01:33:47,820 --> 01:33:51,440
I spent six months in
well because of all this.

1681
01:33:53,110 --> 01:33:54,730
I have brought a burqa for you.

1682
01:33:55,150 --> 01:33:56,320
Come, I'll show it to you.

1683
01:33:56,980 --> 01:33:57,860
Yes.

1684
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:01,980
'They won't lose anything,
you will lose your life.'

1685
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:04,110
'I need to put more
power into my acting.'

1686
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:06,650
'I am a lion.
I will do as I please.'

1687
01:34:08,110 --> 01:34:09,610
Scoundrels, I am a lion.

1688
01:34:09,860 --> 01:34:11,520
- I will do as I please.
- Oh, damn!

1689
01:34:12,020 --> 01:34:13,730
- Lion is here to have fun.
- What is wrong with him?

1690
01:34:14,190 --> 01:34:16,230
- Be careful.
- Wait, you lioness!

1691
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:18,400
I won't let any lioness rule.

1692
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:20,320
I will rule this house.

1693
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:22,070
I want to eat momos!

1694
01:34:22,150 --> 01:34:24,150
I will buy new suit!

1695
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:26,820
I will buy new jeans pants!
Wait, you..

1696
01:34:26,900 --> 01:34:29,570
Wait, I want jeans!

1697
01:34:29,650 --> 01:34:31,070
I want a mobile phone!

1698
01:34:31,150 --> 01:34:33,230
- I will do as I please!
- What is wrong with him?

1699
01:34:33,320 --> 01:34:34,980
I will get married three times.

1700
01:34:35,070 --> 01:34:37,520
- Grandma, we had just one grandpa.
- I will get married three times.

1701
01:34:37,610 --> 01:34:38,730
Who is he possessed with?

1702
01:34:38,860 --> 01:34:43,230
- By the way, he too is very hyper.
- I won't let anyone rule.

1703
01:34:45,650 --> 01:34:48,440
No, grandma!
No, no, no! No grandma!

1704
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:50,900
Let me go, uncle!
Let me go, father!

1705
01:34:50,980 --> 01:34:52,110
- No, no, no.
- Open your mouth!

1706
01:34:52,190 --> 01:34:53,650
- Show it! Open your mouth.
- No, no, no.

1707
01:34:53,730 --> 01:34:55,150
I said open your mouth.

1708
01:34:59,150 --> 01:35:01,440
He is after our lives.

1709
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:02,860
He has possessed him now.

1710
01:35:02,940 --> 01:35:05,440
They are our boys
and not some pyjamas..

1711
01:35:05,940 --> 01:35:08,440
..that you keep changing
them as you like.

1712
01:35:08,980 --> 01:35:10,270
Get me a pair of scissors, boy.

1713
01:35:10,360 --> 01:35:11,610
I'll cut off his ears.

1714
01:35:11,820 --> 01:35:13,110
Here, mother.

1715
01:35:13,190 --> 01:35:14,730
No, please don't do it.

1716
01:35:14,860 --> 01:35:16,400
No. No, take it away.

1717
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:18,690
- Is he possessing you now?
- No grandma, not as yet.

1718
01:35:19,150 --> 01:35:20,940
Get me married, I will leave.

1719
01:35:21,020 --> 01:35:23,150
I dare him to show up.

1720
01:35:23,230 --> 01:35:24,980
Now I know how this works.

1721
01:35:25,730 --> 01:35:27,730
- What kind of a crazy game is this!
- Enough.

1722
01:35:27,820 --> 01:35:30,480
Grandma, I will leave
without any sacrifices.

1723
01:35:30,570 --> 01:35:32,070
Why are you sacrificing his ears?

1724
01:35:33,110 --> 01:35:34,440
Calm down.

1725
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:36,400
He is talking about
sacrificing the ears.

1726
01:35:36,820 --> 01:35:39,110
- Uncle, be careful.
- I am a lioness. I will rule this place.

1727
01:35:40,440 --> 01:35:41,640
It's okay.

1728
01:35:43,150 --> 01:35:49,440
"He showers money over me, when
brother-in-law sees me dancing."

1729
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:51,940
"He showers money over me.."

1730
01:35:52,020 --> 01:35:53,940
"He stayed out for 12 years.."

1731
01:35:54,020 --> 01:35:55,900
"He stayed out for 12 years.."

1732
01:35:55,980 --> 01:35:57,730
"He came back with stars."

1733
01:35:57,810 --> 01:35:59,360
"I am ruined."

1734
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:01,520
"May you lead a happy life,
my love."

1735
01:36:01,610 --> 01:36:02,940
"I am ruined."

1736
01:36:03,020 --> 01:36:04,900
"May you lead a happy life,
my love."

1737
01:36:04,980 --> 01:36:06,230
"I am ruined."

1738
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:08,070
"May you lead a happy life,
my love."

1739
01:36:08,150 --> 01:36:09,820
"I am ruined."

1740
01:36:09,900 --> 01:36:12,520
"May you lead a happy life,
my love. I am ruined."

1741
01:36:12,690 --> 01:36:16,230
"The one who doesn't
dances is crazy."

1742
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:19,730
"The one who doesn't
dances is crazy."

1743
01:36:19,820 --> 01:36:22,980
"I am not going to survive!"

1744
01:36:23,070 --> 01:36:26,190
"Why won't you survive?"

1745
01:36:26,270 --> 01:36:29,900
"My beloved kept
asking me everywhere."

1746
01:36:29,980 --> 01:36:32,480
"Yes or no?"

1747
01:36:32,570 --> 01:36:36,150
"I am not going to survive!"

1748
01:36:36,230 --> 01:36:38,610
"Why won't you survive?"

1749
01:36:38,690 --> 01:36:40,610
"I am not going to survive!"

1750
01:36:40,690 --> 01:36:43,020
"Why won't you survive?"

1751
01:36:43,110 --> 01:36:44,980
"Why won't you survive, dear?"

1752
01:36:45,070 --> 01:36:47,610
"Why won't you survive?"

1753
01:36:48,020 --> 01:36:51,980
"My parents gifted
me all the jewellery."

1754
01:36:52,070 --> 01:36:55,900
"My parents gifted
me all the jewellery."

1755
01:36:55,980 --> 01:36:59,400
"His family gifted
me only one talisman."

1756
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:03,440
"Whenever he fights with me,
he asks me to remove it."

1757
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:05,480
Tell me, how is it my fault?

1758
01:37:05,570 --> 01:37:07,400
I don't want anything.

1759
01:37:07,550 --> 01:37:09,150
I didn't demand dowry.

1760
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:11,480
I only wanted you.

1761
01:37:13,190 --> 01:37:14,480
I loved you.

1762
01:37:15,650 --> 01:37:18,270
That woman's life is going
to get ruined even if I die.

1763
01:37:19,980 --> 01:37:22,230
But it's okay,
true love should win.

1764
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:23,650
Love should survive.

1765
01:37:23,730 --> 01:37:25,610
No Nikka, please don't do that.

1766
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:27,230
This is what I will do.

1767
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:28,860
There is a wooden
ladder on the backside.

1768
01:37:28,940 --> 01:37:29,730
See for yourself.

1769
01:37:30,150 --> 01:37:34,070
Save me if you can, otherwise
it's my final goodbye to you.

1770
01:37:34,610 --> 01:37:36,570
You will keep remembering
me day and night.

1771
01:37:37,020 --> 01:37:37,860
Wait a minute.

1772
01:37:37,940 --> 01:37:39,360
Isn't that Harbhajan Mann's song?

1773
01:37:40,820 --> 01:37:42,480
Whoever's it is.
How does it concern you?

1774
01:37:43,860 --> 01:37:45,900
The rope hanging
on the backside is mine.

1775
01:37:47,610 --> 01:37:50,980
"He stayed out for 12 years.."

1776
01:37:51,070 --> 01:37:52,820
That's grandpa's girlfriend.

1777
01:37:53,570 --> 01:37:55,190
Grandpa's going to marry
someone else tomorrow.

1778
01:37:55,860 --> 01:37:57,900
Then there's grandpa's first wife,
our grandma.

1779
01:37:58,480 --> 01:37:59,730
She is already at home.

1780
01:38:00,970 --> 01:38:02,730
Grandpa has three
women in his life.

1781
01:38:03,320 --> 01:38:04,440
Well done, grandpa.

1782
01:38:05,230 --> 01:38:06,650
I am proud.

1783
01:38:07,230 --> 01:38:08,480
Of the fact that
I am your grandson.

1784
01:38:10,030 --> 01:38:12,730
Honestly, you are on fire.

1785
01:38:32,650 --> 01:38:33,650
Nikka!

1786
01:38:35,070 --> 01:38:36,110
Nikka!

1787
01:38:45,110 --> 01:38:46,070
You are here.

1788
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:47,730
You are late.
What if I was already dead?

1789
01:38:48,610 --> 01:38:49,860
You'll die with this?

1790
01:38:50,270 --> 01:38:51,190
Drama!

1791
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:52,730
I knew you would show up.

1792
01:38:53,110 --> 01:38:55,030
No one can stop true
love from uniting.

1793
01:38:55,110 --> 01:38:56,360
- Come on, let's go.
- Let's go.

1794
01:39:00,730 --> 01:39:01,730
No!

1795
01:39:04,190 --> 01:39:05,570
There is a knot in the drawstring.

1796
01:39:05,650 --> 01:39:07,610
It's nothing.
Don't worry. Let's go.

1797
01:39:08,820 --> 01:39:09,820
No.

1798
01:39:16,930 --> 01:39:20,230
"I'll bravely whisk you away."

1799
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:24,400
"I won't leave this on fate."

1800
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:27,360
"I'll bravely whisk you away."

1801
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:30,360
"I won't leave this on fate."

1802
01:39:30,440 --> 01:39:32,370
"I won't leave this on fate."

1803
01:39:32,450 --> 01:39:35,080
Father, enjoy the moment.

1804
01:39:40,020 --> 01:39:42,030
Bye, Dilipo! Come on, let's go.

1805
01:39:42,110 --> 01:39:44,150
- Run, run, run!
- What happened?

1806
01:39:44,230 --> 01:39:48,020
Look grandma, your husband's
eloping with the druggie's daughter.

1807
01:39:48,110 --> 01:39:49,280
Oh, my God!

1808
01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:51,650
Brother, we will get a new mummy?

1809
01:39:51,730 --> 01:39:53,110
I cannot say about the new mummy.

1810
01:39:53,190 --> 01:39:55,480
But I can say that I will
kill your old daddy for sure.

1811
01:40:15,010 --> 01:40:16,480
What is wrong with it?

1812
01:40:17,210 --> 01:40:18,960
I think we are out of gas.

1813
01:40:19,130 --> 01:40:21,590
You knew we were eloping.
Couldn't you fill the tank?

1814
01:40:22,200 --> 01:40:23,130
I had.

1815
01:40:23,210 --> 01:40:25,960
Brother Satveer must
have sold it to buy drugs.

1816
01:40:30,250 --> 01:40:32,040
I think there are some cars
coming this way. Let's run away.

1817
01:40:32,130 --> 01:40:33,340
Come on, run.

1818
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:11,950
Grandma? I was telling..

1819
01:41:12,290 --> 01:41:15,500
Zaildarni,
you have ruined our reputation.

1820
01:41:15,590 --> 01:41:19,250
Like you had a
very good reputation.

1821
01:41:19,340 --> 01:41:21,090
You cannot even walk straight.

1822
01:41:21,460 --> 01:41:22,590
And you claim that your
reputation has been ruined.

1823
01:41:22,670 --> 01:41:25,090
Your daughter didn't leave alone.

1824
01:41:25,290 --> 01:41:26,420
She left with my husband.

1825
01:41:26,630 --> 01:41:31,590
Come what may, whether
it's your father or your son..

1826
01:41:31,670 --> 01:41:33,590
..we will kill him for sure.

1827
01:41:35,090 --> 01:41:36,170
How can you kill him?

1828
01:41:36,250 --> 01:41:38,290
Didn't you know back
then when she used to come..

1829
01:41:38,380 --> 01:41:40,420
..to our house every
day to park her scooter?

1830
01:41:41,380 --> 01:41:43,380
It was like tempting
gunpowder with fuel.

1831
01:41:43,460 --> 01:41:45,040
It caught fire, now enjoy yourself.

1832
01:41:45,630 --> 01:41:46,960
Now listen to us.

1833
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:48,250
Law is standing right here.

1834
01:41:48,540 --> 01:41:50,090
- What's the boy's age?
- Why?

1835
01:41:50,170 --> 01:41:51,790
Do you have a wedding
proposal for him?

1836
01:41:53,340 --> 01:41:55,340
Do the work you are here for.

1837
01:41:56,040 --> 01:41:58,170
Police has surrounded
you from all sides.

1838
01:41:58,460 --> 01:42:01,130
Come out for your own good.

1839
01:42:01,210 --> 01:42:02,880
Why have you surrounded him?
Do you think he is Jeona Morh?

1840
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:04,500
Stop barking like that.
Give it to me.

1841
01:42:05,420 --> 01:42:06,420
Give it here.

1842
01:42:10,040 --> 01:42:12,500
Come on out, my husband.

1843
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:16,420
Otherwise, I'll have you
crushed along with the sugarcanes.

1844
01:42:20,750 --> 01:42:24,500
In movies, usually they
show a song in such a situation.

1845
01:42:24,750 --> 01:42:26,290
Keep quiet.
You will get us into trouble.

1846
01:42:26,380 --> 01:42:29,090
They will break our bones
if we get caught. Keep quiet.

1847
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,340
So what, Nikka?

1848
01:42:31,420 --> 01:42:35,240
If not alive,
we will be together after death.

1849
01:42:35,590 --> 01:42:36,790
True love.

1850
01:42:37,130 --> 01:42:38,290
You are so naive?

1851
01:42:39,340 --> 01:42:41,420
Father, I had told you
not to buy her a scooter.

1852
01:42:41,500 --> 01:42:42,760
If you hadn't she
wouldn't have left.

1853
01:42:42,840 --> 01:42:43,960
We would've been
able to buy more drugs..

1854
01:42:44,040 --> 01:42:45,380
..with the money you
spent for the scooter.

1855
01:42:45,460 --> 01:42:47,530
We wouldn't have to worry
about drugs for a couple of months.

1856
01:42:48,130 --> 01:42:49,840
What are you saying?

1857
01:42:49,960 --> 01:42:51,340
- Let's go get them.
- Let's go.

1858
01:42:51,420 --> 01:42:52,210
Go for it.

1859
01:42:53,090 --> 01:42:55,090
Grandma..

1860
01:43:24,060 --> 01:43:25,340
Nikka!

1861
01:43:27,570 --> 01:43:28,880
You cannot escape now.

1862
01:43:30,310 --> 01:43:31,660
Oh, my God!

1863
01:43:33,980 --> 01:43:35,090
We got rid of him.

1864
01:43:35,170 --> 01:43:36,590
They killed my son.

1865
01:43:36,670 --> 01:43:39,120
- Police!
- Don't Move!

1866
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:44,500
What happened?

1867
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:45,880
Did you kill him?

1868
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:48,670
He snatched the gun from me.

1869
01:43:48,750 --> 01:43:50,460
Disgusting child.

1870
01:43:51,030 --> 01:43:53,500
- Grandma! Grandma, listen to me.
- Yes?

1871
01:43:53,750 --> 01:43:56,880
What reward will
I get if I catch Nikka?

1872
01:43:56,960 --> 01:43:58,040
You can keep the bull, son.

1873
01:43:58,120 --> 01:43:59,340
- Really?
- Yes.

1874
01:43:59,420 --> 01:44:01,380
- Go.
- Mangal, it is a good deal.

1875
01:44:01,640 --> 01:44:03,960
Now Mangal will
have Nikka shackled.

1876
01:44:04,380 --> 01:44:06,340
I'll get a buffalo for 100 too.

1877
01:44:14,840 --> 01:44:17,170
Oh, so you are enjoying
sugarcanes over here.

1878
01:44:17,250 --> 01:44:19,040
- Well done.
- What are you doing here?

1879
01:44:19,120 --> 01:44:20,540
I am here to take the bull.

1880
01:44:20,630 --> 01:44:21,290
Come here.

1881
01:44:22,170 --> 01:44:23,000
Shall I help you up?

1882
01:44:24,250 --> 01:44:25,590
Wait, I'll get you the bull.

1883
01:44:25,670 --> 01:44:27,880
How many times have
I told you to not interfere?

1884
01:44:28,240 --> 01:44:29,460
Do you want the bull now?

1885
01:44:38,850 --> 01:44:40,460
Where am I?

1886
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:42,180
Nikka!

1887
01:44:42,310 --> 01:44:44,340
The bull has gone wild!

1888
01:44:44,540 --> 01:44:46,840
Mangal, you know how Nikka is.

1889
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:48,210
Why did you get beaten up?

1890
01:44:48,290 --> 01:44:49,420
You got the bull?

1891
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:51,420
You can take cash from grandma.

1892
01:44:53,750 --> 01:44:54,960
I am dead.

1893
01:44:55,130 --> 01:44:56,210
- I am doomed.
- Grandma, he is back.

1894
01:44:56,430 --> 01:44:58,050
- I am ruined, grandma.
- Where's Nikka?

1895
01:44:58,130 --> 01:44:59,840
- I got beaten up.
- Where's Nikka?

1896
01:45:00,010 --> 01:45:02,290
Grandma,
you handle this on your own.

1897
01:45:02,420 --> 01:45:04,090
It doesn't concern this poor man.

1898
01:45:04,170 --> 01:45:06,290
My children will become orphan.

1899
01:45:06,380 --> 01:45:07,640
Get this straight, grandma.

1900
01:45:07,780 --> 01:45:09,160
You should get
rid of these bullets.

1901
01:45:09,240 --> 01:45:10,360
You don't have that
kind of power anymore.

1902
01:45:10,440 --> 01:45:12,950
What will I do with your bull?

1903
01:45:13,030 --> 01:45:16,370
I am starving.
I am hungry.

1904
01:45:16,450 --> 01:45:17,960
Give me food.

1905
01:45:37,160 --> 01:45:40,370
Sage, stop your daughter.

1906
01:45:40,450 --> 01:45:44,240
What will we do if he
runs away with two girls?

1907
01:45:44,320 --> 01:45:47,700
Babaji, you know everything.

1908
01:45:47,780 --> 01:45:50,740
You know what will happen next,
don't you?

1909
01:45:53,320 --> 01:45:55,360
This is all fate.

1910
01:45:56,610 --> 01:45:57,700
Whatever it is...

1911
01:45:58,160 --> 01:46:01,240
Babaji, this is fun.

1912
01:46:08,950 --> 01:46:10,490
If you had not taken
so long to reply..

1913
01:46:10,990 --> 01:46:12,660
..then we wouldn't
have to face this day.

1914
01:46:13,320 --> 01:46:14,240
So it is my fault?

1915
01:46:14,740 --> 01:46:16,510
Fine, it is my fault.

1916
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:40,200
Look sister,
we have made a mistake.

1917
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:44,070
But we love each other
since college times.

1918
01:46:44,910 --> 01:46:47,320
We just tried to act
arrogant with each other.

1919
01:46:49,070 --> 01:46:52,240
You are so beautiful.
You can have anyone you want.

1920
01:46:53,160 --> 01:46:54,660
But she will die without me.

1921
01:46:56,160 --> 01:46:59,320
I went a little off track.
I love her.

1922
01:46:59,940 --> 01:47:01,410
I like you.

1923
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:04,660
I won't spare you for
the next seven lifetimes.

1924
01:47:07,240 --> 01:47:08,490
But I am a woman.

1925
01:47:09,870 --> 01:47:11,610
And being a woman..

1926
01:47:12,360 --> 01:47:14,470
..I cannot break
another woman's heart.

1927
01:47:16,750 --> 01:47:17,610
Sister!

1928
01:47:18,360 --> 01:47:20,360
Please save us from your father.

1929
01:47:22,160 --> 01:47:23,070
Let's go.

1930
01:47:23,530 --> 01:47:24,360
'Thank God.'

1931
01:47:24,950 --> 01:47:26,610
'This thing about
girls is very nice.'

1932
01:47:27,030 --> 01:47:28,660
'They always think
a lot about each other.'

1933
01:47:33,060 --> 01:47:35,610
There you go. Grandpa is back.
Grandpa is back, uncle.

1934
01:47:35,690 --> 01:47:37,700
- Look at my new grandma.
- Come.

1935
01:47:37,950 --> 01:47:39,160
They are back, aunt.

1936
01:47:39,810 --> 01:47:42,490
- Shoot him!
- Exorcise his ghost!

1937
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:47,590
We'll show him the consequences
of eloping with someone.

1938
01:47:47,670 --> 01:47:48,890
Kill him.

1939
01:47:51,910 --> 01:47:52,570
Dad!

1940
01:47:52,920 --> 01:47:55,660
Dad, please tell them the truth.

1941
01:47:55,740 --> 01:47:58,720
Otherwise, these naÃ¯ve
people will kill them both.

1942
01:48:00,660 --> 01:48:02,860
What are you waiting for?
Shoot him.

1943
01:48:03,320 --> 01:48:04,420
Dad, please.

1944
01:48:04,610 --> 01:48:07,660
Look, 50% of the
people you bring to us..

1945
01:48:07,740 --> 01:48:10,860
..are pretending to be
possessed just like Nikka did.

1946
01:48:10,940 --> 01:48:12,570
They stop the drama once
they fear they'll get beaten up.

1947
01:48:12,660 --> 01:48:14,110
And I get praised.

1948
01:48:14,200 --> 01:48:15,160
What is this?

1949
01:48:15,240 --> 01:48:18,330
Now whether there are
ghost in this world or not...

1950
01:48:18,410 --> 01:48:19,660
God alone knows that.

1951
01:48:19,740 --> 01:48:23,420
Honestly speaking,
I have no idea about it.

1952
01:48:26,040 --> 01:48:27,110
You...

1953
01:48:27,570 --> 01:48:28,530
This is new.

1954
01:48:28,610 --> 01:48:30,080
He says Nikka isn't possessed.

1955
01:48:30,160 --> 01:48:33,080
Who told you that he is possessed?

1956
01:48:33,480 --> 01:48:35,270
Charna.

1957
01:48:35,690 --> 01:48:38,230
He is the one who spread
the rumour across the village too.

1958
01:48:38,310 --> 01:48:42,300
Malha, you are mistaken.
Come on, you are acting strange.

1959
01:48:42,380 --> 01:48:43,940
How am I mistaken, huh?

1960
01:48:44,020 --> 01:48:46,100
Let's get Baba and Charna.

1961
01:48:46,180 --> 01:48:47,640
He is the one who takes
people to such places.

1962
01:48:47,720 --> 01:48:49,010
- Get them!
- Come here, you thug!

1963
01:48:49,090 --> 01:48:50,180
Wait!

1964
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:51,470
Why are you causing such a racket?

1965
01:48:51,550 --> 01:48:54,800
Are you stupid that
you blindly followed him?

1966
01:48:55,100 --> 01:48:56,640
It is our fault.

1967
01:48:56,720 --> 01:48:58,930
There are beautiful
Gurudwaras in every village.

1968
01:48:59,010 --> 01:49:01,100
We should go there and pray.

1969
01:49:01,180 --> 01:49:06,060
We keep sending truckloads of almonds,
cashews and sugar to the Babas..

1970
01:49:06,140 --> 01:49:09,760
..even when we can't
a square meal for ourselves.

1971
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:12,270
I too just realised this.

1972
01:49:12,350 --> 01:49:17,020
Fools, you used to burn lamps
in his favour when he was lying.

1973
01:49:17,100 --> 01:49:20,020
Now you want to kill him
when he is telling the truth?

1974
01:49:22,640 --> 01:49:23,770
And you?

1975
01:49:23,850 --> 01:49:27,830
I'll shoot you if you
do such a drama again.

1976
01:49:28,310 --> 01:49:29,640
Go home, girl.

1977
01:49:29,720 --> 01:49:31,730
Brother, you go and
start making preparations.

1978
01:49:31,810 --> 01:49:33,020
We are coming over with our guests.

1979
01:49:33,100 --> 01:49:34,810
How can we just get
them married right away?

1980
01:49:34,890 --> 01:49:36,540
We need to do a lot of work.

1981
01:49:36,620 --> 01:49:40,960
Did you think about
work when she had eloped?

1982
01:49:41,500 --> 01:49:42,440
Listen up.

1983
01:49:42,520 --> 01:49:44,810
Let me know if you want
to give us your daughter..

1984
01:49:45,140 --> 01:49:47,270
..otherwise, we will
marry him to Baba's daughter.

1985
01:49:48,270 --> 01:49:50,270
We are paupers.

1986
01:49:50,350 --> 01:49:52,840
We don't have money to buy drugs.

1987
01:49:52,920 --> 01:49:55,020
We don't have dollars lying
around in our house either.

1988
01:49:55,100 --> 01:49:56,350
Do as she says.

1989
01:49:56,430 --> 01:49:57,630
It will be better for us, brother.

1990
01:49:58,350 --> 01:50:01,470
Charna, you would have
gotten my son killed.

1991
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:03,850
Major, I am your brother.

1992
01:50:03,930 --> 01:50:05,570
Do brothers behave like this,
you devil?

1993
01:50:06,140 --> 01:50:07,350
Get him! Beat him up!

1994
01:50:07,430 --> 01:50:08,350
- Get him!
- Aunt!

1995
01:50:09,270 --> 01:50:11,270
Nikka, I am your uncle.

1996
01:50:11,350 --> 01:50:13,180
Babaji, perform a miracle.

1997
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:16,600
- Get him!
- Spare me!

1998
01:50:16,680 --> 01:50:19,580
I won't take anyone
to the Baba's henceforth.

1999
01:50:28,600 --> 01:50:31,690
Let go of her hand or
you will get into trouble.

2000
01:50:31,770 --> 01:50:33,650
Come on, give me the keys.

2001
01:50:34,570 --> 01:50:35,850
I lost the keys, grandma.

2002
01:50:36,590 --> 01:50:38,600
It's okay, we will break
the lock of the trunk.

2003
01:50:38,680 --> 01:50:39,750
- We will break it.
- Yes.

2004
01:50:39,830 --> 01:50:42,580
Friends, we are live now.
There are 500 people with us.

2005
01:50:42,660 --> 01:50:44,500
My uncle's son has
done a brave thing.

2006
01:50:44,580 --> 01:50:46,910
Say hello to everyone. She
is my sister-in-law. She is great.

2007
01:50:46,990 --> 01:50:49,280
Talk to my grandma too.
We will party later.

2008
01:50:49,360 --> 01:50:51,850
He has a bad nature.
He cannot talk well.

2009
01:50:51,930 --> 01:50:52,560
Are you alright?

2010
01:50:52,640 --> 01:50:55,020
Okay, you saw how everything
worked out at my grandma's place.

2011
01:50:55,100 --> 01:50:58,560
I am so happy.

2012
01:51:01,390 --> 01:51:02,310
Gary?

2013
01:51:02,390 --> 01:51:03,970
Here, hold him.

2014
01:51:06,020 --> 01:51:07,270
Come here.

2015
01:51:07,350 --> 01:51:10,140
Oh my handsome boy.

2016
01:51:10,220 --> 01:51:11,970
Yes, yes.

2017
01:51:12,060 --> 01:51:13,560
- Say papa.
- Come on, let's go.

2018
01:51:13,640 --> 01:51:14,690
Say it.

2019
01:51:15,450 --> 01:51:16,950
What's your name, son?

2020
01:51:17,640 --> 01:51:19,350
- What's my boy's name?
- Tell her.

2021
01:51:20,410 --> 01:51:21,890
Vaisakha!

2022
01:51:22,220 --> 01:51:23,310
Damn!

2023
01:51:44,100 --> 01:51:45,320
You cannot escape!

2024
01:51:45,770 --> 01:51:47,520
There is nothing wrong with me.
Let me go.

2025
01:51:47,720 --> 01:51:51,190
Relax, I know there
is nothing wrong with you.

2026
01:51:51,270 --> 01:51:56,060
"After spending three years
in Canada, o' beautiful..."

2027
01:51:56,140 --> 01:52:00,200
"I have come back after
planting berries there."

2028
01:52:00,700 --> 01:52:06,840
"I couldn't do anything
about it you just drove pass me."

2029
01:52:07,220 --> 01:52:12,900
"After planting potatoes among
eucalyptus trees, I cried on GT road."

2030
01:52:13,610 --> 01:52:15,040
Shall I sing Angrez Beat song?

2031
01:52:15,570 --> 01:52:16,800
Isn't that Honey Singh's song?

2032
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:20,780
Come on, I wrote the song.
He just added music to it.

2033
01:52:20,860 --> 01:52:23,180
You don't know the power of a pen,
you fool.

2034
01:52:23,950 --> 01:52:25,370
Give me your hand, let me explain.

2035
01:52:26,500 --> 01:52:29,510
Forget my hand,
you can hold my ankle.

2036
01:52:29,590 --> 01:52:30,690
I will.

2037
01:52:30,770 --> 01:52:32,790
I belong to you now, my love.

2038
01:52:33,100 --> 01:52:34,000
You can hold them.

2039
01:52:37,770 --> 01:52:38,930
You won't hold them?

2040
01:52:41,680 --> 01:52:42,810
Go ahead.

2041
01:52:44,720 --> 01:52:45,970
Oh damn, run for your life!

2042
01:53:00,330 --> 01:53:03,100
"My life has become
colourful once again."

2043
01:53:03,180 --> 01:53:07,510
"Your charm has worked it's magic."

2044
01:53:08,840 --> 01:53:11,630
"My life has become
colourful once again."

2045
01:53:11,710 --> 01:53:14,210
"Your charm has worked it's magic."

2046
01:53:14,300 --> 01:53:19,380
"I have put all my arms and
ammunitions under lock and key."

2047
01:53:19,460 --> 01:53:24,710
"Now I only use the
weapon called love."

2048
01:53:25,130 --> 01:53:30,590
"I swear you have changed me."

2049
01:53:30,670 --> 01:53:36,260
"Now I wander around
like a man possessed."

2050
01:53:36,340 --> 01:53:41,960
"Now I wander around
like a man possessed."

2051
01:53:42,050 --> 01:53:48,190
"Now I wander around
like a man possessed."

2052
01:53:59,340 --> 01:54:05,300
"I planned a candle light
dinner for us close to the well."

2053
01:54:05,380 --> 01:54:10,900
"I have filled the
village with lamps."

2054
01:54:10,980 --> 01:54:15,840
"I have filled the
village with lamps."

2055
01:54:15,920 --> 01:54:21,380
"I dream about
our future together."

2056
01:54:21,460 --> 01:54:27,130
"Just like the soldiers
dream about the army."

2057
01:54:27,210 --> 01:54:32,630
"I swear you have changed me."

2058
01:54:32,710 --> 01:54:38,340
"Now I wander around
like a man possessed."

2059
01:54:38,420 --> 01:54:43,960
"Now I wander around
like a man possessed."

2060
01:54:44,050 --> 01:54:50,460
"Now I wander around
like a man possessed."
