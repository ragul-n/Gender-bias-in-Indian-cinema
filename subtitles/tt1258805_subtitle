Snake.

2
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,668
Oh God! Snake.

3
00:00:55,769 --> 00:00:59,398
Balaji, a snake is about to bite
your friend Dhana Lakshmi.

4
00:01:01,775 --> 00:01:02,867
Dhana Lakshmi.

5
00:01:07,047 --> 00:01:10,744
Snake. - Dhana Lakshmi, go away.
Yes, you, go away.

6
00:01:10,851 --> 00:01:12,546
Dhana Lakshmi, listen
to me. Run away.

7
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:14,949
l said run away. Go away,
Dhana. Go away.

8
00:01:15,055 --> 00:01:16,283
Go away.

9
00:01:22,796 --> 00:01:23,820
Dhana dear.

10
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,366
lt's too late. Have
some meals, girl.

11
00:01:30,404 --> 00:01:32,372
You are my sweet girl, aren't
you? Have some meals, girl.

12
00:01:32,873 --> 00:01:33,897
Where is father?
- He is on terrace talking on phone.

13
00:01:34,007 --> 00:01:36,840
Have it, dear.
- l will eat only when father comes.

14
00:01:37,477 --> 00:01:42,312
Your aunt (stepmother)
might beat you. - Subbaiah

15
00:01:42,749 --> 00:01:46,446
Yes, ma'am. - Leave her. She
will eat when she's hungry.

16
00:01:47,487 --> 00:01:48,977
Rajeshwari, what's the matter?

17
00:01:49,089 --> 00:01:50,386
What is my sweetheart up to there?

18
00:01:52,092 --> 00:01:57,394
Oh ! What happened! lt seems
my sweetheart it angry there.

19
00:01:57,497 --> 00:02:00,466
My sweetheart never gets angry.

20
00:02:00,901 --> 00:02:03,335
She never gets angry no matter what.

21
00:02:03,437 --> 00:02:05,667
My sweetheart is such a nice girl.

22
00:02:08,108 --> 00:02:09,803
Here is your new pen.

23
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,673
Thank you, father.

24
00:02:16,516 --> 00:02:19,542
Balaji. Who is this Balaji?

25
00:02:19,653 --> 00:02:21,621
He is Miss. Dhana's classmate.

26
00:02:23,657 --> 00:02:25,022
Dhana Lakshmi.

27
00:02:29,663 --> 00:02:37,035
''Lullabies, fun games
and affection.''

28
00:02:38,472 --> 00:02:45,036
''An honest laugh and
spotless heart.''

29
00:02:45,745 --> 00:02:52,913
''A child's heart knows nothing
other than that.''

30
00:02:53,620 --> 00:03:00,788
''That's what brings a smile
on a child's face.''

31
00:03:01,495 --> 00:03:03,588
''O love!''

32
00:03:07,701 --> 00:03:09,669
''O love!''

33
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:12,602
''O love!''

34
00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:17,604
''O love!''

35
00:04:08,895 --> 00:04:11,523
Dhana, why are you crying like that?

36
00:04:11,831 --> 00:04:14,459
lf my father was alive
he would've lifted me..

37
00:04:14,568 --> 00:04:16,468
..and played with me, you know..

38
00:04:21,107 --> 00:04:22,597
Dhana Lakshmi.

39
00:04:35,722 --> 00:04:37,155
Hey, put her down.

40
00:04:38,992 --> 00:04:42,484
lf you step inside the fence
l will break your legs.

41
00:04:42,596 --> 00:04:45,156
Get lost from here. Get lost.

42
00:04:52,606 --> 00:04:53,903
Dhana, why are you standing here..

43
00:04:54,007 --> 00:04:55,565
..when everyone is going
into the class?

44
00:04:55,675 --> 00:04:57,506
l am waiting for Balaji, teacher.

45
00:04:57,611 --> 00:05:00,910
His father has got a transfer.
He left this city.

46
00:05:01,014 --> 00:05:02,504
Balaji won't come to school again.

47
00:05:08,154 --> 00:05:10,918
Balaji. Balaji. Balaji.

48
00:05:11,024 --> 00:05:13,515
Girl.
- Where is Balaji?

49
00:05:13,627 --> 00:05:16,528
They left to city. He wanted
to meet you once..

50
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,530
..but his father has beaten
him up and took him away.

51
00:05:18,632 --> 00:05:19,860
Dear.
- Yes, coming.

52
00:05:28,241 --> 00:05:29,936
Dhana's state-first rank
in tenth standard..

53
00:05:30,043 --> 00:05:31,533
..is not an ordinary achievement.

54
00:05:32,712 --> 00:05:34,543
l heard that you are
still not very keen..

55
00:05:34,648 --> 00:05:36,616
..on sending Dhana to college.

56
00:05:37,183 --> 00:05:38,616
She lost both her mother and father.

57
00:05:38,785 --> 00:05:41,549
You are the one who has to take
care of her. - Alright.

58
00:05:41,921 --> 00:05:43,548
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

59
00:05:44,924 --> 00:05:45,948
Did you see that, brother?

60
00:05:46,793 --> 00:05:49,557
That scoundrel left mere
50 lakhs for me..

61
00:05:49,663 --> 00:05:52,223
..and left 50 crores
for his daughter.

62
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,566
That fact is already
giving me heartburn.

63
00:05:54,668 --> 00:05:55,692
And to add to my worries
here comes a new problem.

64
00:05:55,802 --> 00:05:58,566
What's the big deal, sister!
lf we get her married..

65
00:05:58,672 --> 00:06:00,765
..to a man who'd follow our orders
she'll be in our hands.

66
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:05,170
Dhana Lakshmi. Letter.

67
00:06:06,146 --> 00:06:07,170
Balaji.

68
00:06:08,281 --> 00:06:09,839
'Dhana Lakshmi, how are you?'

69
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:10,973
'lt's me. Balaji.'

70
00:06:11,151 --> 00:06:13,642
'l read it in papers that you got
state-first rank in 10th standard.'

71
00:06:13,753 --> 00:06:15,778
'Congrats! l am so very
happy for you.'

72
00:06:16,089 --> 00:06:17,181
'Right now l am in Hyderabad..'

73
00:06:17,891 --> 00:06:22,260
Balaji. Balaji. Balaji. You
didn't forget him yet?

74
00:06:23,963 --> 00:06:26,864
Aunt, please don't tear it. Please.

75
00:06:27,167 --> 00:06:28,930
Aunt. Aunt, please give it to me.

76
00:06:32,372 --> 00:06:33,600
l'll kill you.

77
00:06:39,646 --> 00:06:42,615
Yes, we had to arrange Dhana
Lakshmi's engagement..

78
00:06:42,716 --> 00:06:44,616
Team DG

79
00:06:45,318 --> 00:06:48,617
Yes, l will personally come
to your place to invite you.

80
00:06:48,722 --> 00:06:49,950
Greetings.
- Greetings, madam.

81
00:06:52,792 --> 00:06:54,623
Subbaiyah, is Dhana back?

82
00:06:57,397 --> 00:06:59,627
Dhana Lakshmi didn't
go to college today.

83
00:07:00,133 --> 00:07:02,829
l searched her everywhere, but
l couldn't find her anywhere.

84
00:07:02,936 --> 00:07:04,631
Dhana Lakshmi ran away.

85
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,700
Hello everybody! l welcome
one and all..

86
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:19,040
..who came to the felicitation
ceremony..

87
00:08:19,145 --> 00:08:21,306
..of the top industrialist
Mr. Narayana Rao.

88
00:08:21,414 --> 00:08:22,711
lt's a proud moment for us that
we got an opportunity..

89
00:08:22,816 --> 00:08:23,840
..to felicitate him.

90
00:08:24,818 --> 00:08:27,719
Our Narayana Rao who started out..

91
00:08:27,821 --> 00:08:30,722
..as just another mechanic has
today reached great heights..

92
00:08:30,824 --> 00:08:33,725
..whom all of us look up to,
and the reason behind it..

93
00:08:33,827 --> 00:08:35,988
..is his untiring efforts, hard
work, focus and determination.

94
00:08:36,362 --> 00:08:38,728
Now notable industrialist
Mr. Sharma..

95
00:08:38,832 --> 00:08:41,392
..will felicitate Narayana
Rao with a garland.

96
00:08:46,239 --> 00:08:49,731
Greetings to everyone.
My hard work is not..

97
00:08:49,843 --> 00:08:52,812
..the only reason behind my success.

98
00:08:53,179 --> 00:08:54,737
But the credit also goes to
my family who stood by me..

99
00:08:54,848 --> 00:08:56,873
..in thick and thin.

100
00:08:57,517 --> 00:09:00,213
Thank you. They too have
a share in this success.

101
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,083
That's why l want to introduce
you to them..

102
00:09:02,188 --> 00:09:04,349
..through this screen.

103
00:09:07,126 --> 00:09:09,094
She is my wife Kamala. She
doesn't know anything..

104
00:09:09,195 --> 00:09:10,958
..outside the family.

105
00:09:11,798 --> 00:09:13,766
He is my elder son Shekhar.
After completing M Tech..

106
00:09:13,867 --> 00:09:16,165
..he is working as chief
engineer in BHEL.

107
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,235
That girl is my daughter-in-law
Krishnaveni.

108
00:09:18,872 --> 00:09:20,840
Not just my daughter-in-law,
but my niece as well.

109
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,101
This girl is my only
daughter Surekha.

110
00:09:23,877 --> 00:09:26,778
Come in. How are you?
- l am fine, but the rice..

111
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,781
..you gave me last week for
dosas isn't find, mom.

112
00:09:29,883 --> 00:09:31,976
Oh no! l will give you
better rice this time.

113
00:09:32,285 --> 00:09:35,777
Mummy, bye. l'll come next week.
- Ok, take care.

114
00:09:36,289 --> 00:09:37,847
The man following her
is my son-in-law.

115
00:09:37,957 --> 00:09:40,323
Don't underestimate him
as he is carrying goods.

116
00:09:40,426 --> 00:09:42,053
He is also a software engineer.

117
00:09:42,428 --> 00:09:45,192
He is my grandson Chintu.
My daughter's son.

118
00:09:45,298 --> 00:09:46,322
He stays with us.

119
00:09:47,033 --> 00:09:49,797
Uncle. Uncle. Ask your son
to study well. - Why?

120
00:09:49,903 --> 00:09:51,803
Only if he studies well
l would be able to..

121
00:09:51,905 --> 00:09:53,133
..copy from his paper
and pass the exams.

122
00:09:53,973 --> 00:09:55,873
He's a bit active.

123
00:10:00,914 --> 00:10:03,474
This is my family.
- Sir, he's lying.

124
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:06,477
He has another son. The next
shots were his shots.

125
00:10:07,253 --> 00:10:09,346
That's not true.
- Then continue it.

126
00:10:10,256 --> 00:10:12,417
Why are you hesitating? Continue it.

127
00:10:12,525 --> 00:10:15,153
Because it would be insulting
to him we know about him.

128
00:10:15,328 --> 00:10:16,488
Switch it on.

129
00:10:19,132 --> 00:10:21,032
Hey! Hey! Aravind.

130
00:10:22,869 --> 00:10:23,893
He's running away with my bag.

131
00:10:33,146 --> 00:10:36,843
He looks like a good fellow. He
has got helping nature as well.

132
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:40,113
Watch it completely, sir.
- Continue, Mr. Narayana.

133
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,524
Excuse me!

134
00:10:55,969 --> 00:10:58,267
l have been following you
from the restaurant.

135
00:10:58,371 --> 00:11:01,397
You set out to help that girl,
but you came here?

136
00:11:01,507 --> 00:11:03,532
What about that girl?
- ls it that girl?

137
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,941
Aravind, three will be enough?

138
00:11:06,312 --> 00:11:08,143
My, he's running away with my bag.

139
00:11:09,315 --> 00:11:10,339
And the thief?

140
00:11:11,117 --> 00:11:13,347
ls it him?
- Buddy, we got the tickets.

141
00:11:13,453 --> 00:11:17,947
Hey, you ! All of you are
from the same team? - Ya.

142
00:11:18,524 --> 00:11:21,084
But why did you do so?
- That hotel bill was 3,500 rupees.

143
00:11:21,194 --> 00:11:22,218
Will your dad pay the bill?

144
00:11:25,064 --> 00:11:26,088
Narayana, you gave
such a major shock?

145
00:11:26,332 --> 00:11:28,960
Did your wife conceive him
while watching Crime Watch?

146
00:11:29,469 --> 00:11:31,494
You have got such a son? -

147
00:11:31,604 --> 00:11:33,902
We give him foreign cars
for repair and his son..

148
00:11:34,007 --> 00:11:36,373
..goes out with his friends
on them as if he owns them.

149
00:11:36,476 --> 00:11:40,173
Those who see that think that
we are using his car.

150
00:11:40,413 --> 00:11:42,904
You who can't even put
your son in control..

151
00:11:43,016 --> 00:11:45,177
..don't deserve this garland and
this felicitation. Cancel.

152
00:11:47,353 --> 00:11:49,253
Sir, l have four daughters.

153
00:11:49,489 --> 00:11:51,923
l had to move out of this
area as l wasn't able to..

154
00:11:52,025 --> 00:11:53,925
..put up with him and his idiotic
gang's idiotic deeds, sir.

155
00:11:54,027 --> 00:11:56,518
Stand up.
- l am already standing.

156
00:11:56,629 --> 00:11:57,926
Stand up on the bench.

157
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:02,932

158
00:12:05,972 --> 00:12:06,996

Underwear cancelled.

162
00:12:19,986 --> 00:12:21,613
Thank God, l have still
got my clothes on.

163
00:12:22,255 --> 00:12:23,950
His son goes out with his
friends on our cars..

164
00:12:24,057 --> 00:12:25,081
..as if he owns them. Those
who see that think that..

165
00:12:25,191 --> 00:12:26,215
..we are using his car.

166
00:12:26,659 --> 00:12:28,957
Oh God! He gave his
car for servicing.

167
00:12:30,063 --> 00:12:31,621
Thank God the car's here.

168
00:12:32,198 --> 00:12:35,634
Kamala. Kamala.
- Oh God! - Where's your stupid son?

169
00:12:35,735 --> 00:12:39,102
l am worshipping here and
you are ruining mood.

170
00:12:39,205 --> 00:12:42,038
You take a bath and
go to the workshop.

171
00:12:42,141 --> 00:12:44,507
lf you wake up at 7 and go to
work we will shut shop soon.

172
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:47,170
l praised you so much in the dreams.

173
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:51,512
Dear, how's the Upma?
- lt's great. Pour some more.

174
00:12:52,151 --> 00:12:53,175
Pour some more?

175
00:12:53,286 --> 00:12:54,446
Good morning, father.
- Good morning.

176
00:12:54,554 --> 00:12:56,988
The Taxi Owners' Association
was about to..

177
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:59,991
..felicitate you today, right?
- That's what l am tensed about.

178
00:13:00,093 --> 00:13:02,391
Tensed?
- l mean it's about Aravind.

179
00:13:02,495 --> 00:13:03,985
l feared that he might have
fled with the car..

180
00:13:04,097 --> 00:13:05,257
..l park outside when
l was in sleep.

181
00:13:05,364 --> 00:13:06,388
What's there to get
so tensed, father?

182
00:13:06,499 --> 00:13:07,989
lt's not an ordinary car.
- ls it a secondhand one?

183
00:13:08,434 --> 00:13:11,062
Shut up! lt's a new Benz car.
lt goes on high speed.

184
00:13:12,505 --> 00:13:14,336
You know how much
it costs? 50 lakhs.

185
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,000
lts owner gave it to me for
servicing with great fear.

186
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:19,203
l have to hand it over
to him in flowers.

187
00:13:19,312 --> 00:13:22,145
You know what would happen if
Aravind gets such a costly car!

188
00:13:22,248 --> 00:13:23,613
We will have to sell it
to the garbage-vendor.

189
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,153
You take a bath, uncle. l
will serve the breakfast.

190
00:13:30,256 --> 00:13:32,486
Alright. Alright. And
where is my grandson?

191
00:13:32,592 --> 00:13:35,152
l am here, grandpa. l
am watching TV news.

192
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:38,025
Very good. And why are you
watching news channel..

193
00:13:38,131 --> 00:13:40,565
..instead of watching cartoons
like other kids do?

194
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:43,032
ln weather report they
are forecasting rains.

195
00:13:43,136 --> 00:13:45,229
They would announce it on
TV if we get a leave.

196
00:13:46,472 --> 00:13:47,496
That's the reason.

197
00:13:56,616 --> 00:13:58,174
Mom.
- Where are you?

198
00:13:58,284 --> 00:14:00,047
The old man has woken up?
- You come fast.

199
00:14:00,153 --> 00:14:01,177
Ok. Ok. l'm coming.

200
00:14:06,425 --> 00:14:07,585
Look how the top ten
figures of our area..

201
00:14:07,693 --> 00:14:09,058
..are revolving around him.

202
00:14:10,163 --> 00:14:12,063
My blood starts burning
like acid when..

203
00:14:12,165 --> 00:14:14,065
..that ordinary mechanic's son
hangs out in a new car..

204
00:14:14,167 --> 00:14:16,533
..with a new girl everyday.
- Cool, buddy. Cool.

205
00:14:16,702 --> 00:14:18,135
We will get him some day.

206
00:14:18,838 --> 00:14:23,138
Who locked the door? Kamala.
Kamala. Open the door.

207
00:14:23,843 --> 00:14:25,674
Centipede. Centipede. There's
a centipede here.

208
00:14:25,778 --> 00:14:27,143
Coming. l'm coming.
- Open the door.

209
00:14:28,114 --> 00:14:29,138
Where's the centipede, uncle?

210
00:14:29,248 --> 00:14:31,341
Forget the centipede and first
tell me who bolted the door.

211
00:14:59,412 --> 00:15:01,437
Hey, good-for-nothing fellow,
you are out of your mind?

212
00:15:01,547 --> 00:15:03,310
What do you think you are doing!

213
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,518
Hello!
- ls this mechanic Narayana's house?

214
00:15:06,619 --> 00:15:09,110
Yes, it's me. Tell me.
- Sir, we are talking..

215
00:15:09,222 --> 00:15:11,122
..from L & T Company. We
are thinking of giving..

216
00:15:11,224 --> 00:15:13,317
..our company's 50 cars
to your service centre.

217
00:15:13,426 --> 00:15:15,394
What did you say, madam?
Say it again.

218
00:15:15,494 --> 00:15:18,122
You heard it right. We are
thinking of giving..

219
00:15:18,231 --> 00:15:20,392
..our 50 cars to your service
centre. - 50 cars?

220
00:15:20,499 --> 00:15:23,195
How did you find out
about our company?

221
00:15:23,302 --> 00:15:26,135
Oh come on ! Your servicing
centre is very famous..

222
00:15:26,239 --> 00:15:28,207
..in the city, you don't know that?
- l don't know.

223
00:15:28,307 --> 00:15:29,535
Yes, l know now. You just said it.

224
00:15:29,642 --> 00:15:32,475
Ok. Ok. How much do you charge
to service one car?

225
00:15:32,578 --> 00:15:35,342
How much? 500 rupees.
- 500 rupees.

226
00:15:35,448 --> 00:15:37,541
500 multiplied by 50 makes
it 25,000 rupees.

227
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:39,208
Ok, take 50,000 rupees instead.

228
00:15:39,318 --> 00:15:40,683
How do you accept payments?
By check or cash?

229
00:15:40,786 --> 00:15:43,152
l accept both. - Then we will
have to close our company.

230
00:15:43,256 --> 00:15:46,157
No, no. l didn't mean that.
We accept payments..

231
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:48,693
..through both cash and checks.
- Then l'll pay in cash.

232
00:15:48,794 --> 00:15:51,490
25,000 in cash? Madam,
is this for real?

233
00:15:51,597 --> 00:15:53,497
Of course, it's real.
You are not my uncle..

234
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,760
..that l would joke with you.
- That's not what l meant.

235
00:15:55,868 --> 00:15:57,836
By the way when are
you sending the cars?

236
00:15:57,937 --> 00:15:59,165
When we buy them.

237
00:15:59,272 --> 00:16:01,763
No. No. We are thinking of
buying another 50 cars.

238
00:16:01,874 --> 00:16:04,240
We will send all of them together.
- Thanks, madam.

239
00:16:06,545 --> 00:16:07,569
Get lost.

240
00:16:08,481 --> 00:16:10,506
What happened, dad?
- We got a nice order..

241
00:16:10,616 --> 00:16:12,777
..from L & T company. - Your hard
work didn't go waste, dad.

242
00:16:12,885 --> 00:16:14,375
Now all the orders in
the city will be yours.

243
00:16:14,487 --> 00:16:16,182
Soon we will become the richest
family in the city.

244
00:16:16,289 --> 00:16:18,189
Hey, cut that crap! Dad,
before you got the call..

245
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:19,656
..you were reprimanding him.

246
00:16:20,826 --> 00:16:22,726
That car was worth 50
lakhs, wasn't it?

247
00:16:31,771 --> 00:16:34,672
Stop it! l am not wandering in
city on your cars like a nomad.

248
00:16:34,774 --> 00:16:36,207
l charge 50 rupees from everyone
who sits in the car..

249
00:16:36,309 --> 00:16:38,209
..and earn 500 rupees everyday..

250
00:16:38,311 --> 00:16:40,336
..and hand over that money to mom.

251
00:16:42,315 --> 00:16:45,876
To me? - What! He gives
you 500 rupees daily?

252
00:16:46,385 --> 00:16:47,875
That makes it 15,000
rupees per month.

253
00:16:47,987 --> 00:16:49,614
What do you do with that money?
- Actually..

254
00:16:49,722 --> 00:16:51,622
Why are you panicking, aunt?

255
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:53,224
You donate 1,000 rupees in lord
Venkateshwara's temple..

256
00:16:53,326 --> 00:16:55,294
..on his name every now
and then, don't you?

257
00:16:56,262 --> 00:16:58,822
Yes. Yes.
- Worship. Donation. 1,000 rupees.

258
00:16:58,931 --> 00:17:01,422
l donate 1,000 rupees..
- 1,000 rupees?

259
00:17:01,934 --> 00:17:03,424
That's the reason we got 50 cars.

260
00:17:03,536 --> 00:17:05,902
l too have responsibilities.
- Good joke. Good joke.

261
00:17:06,005 --> 00:17:08,235
Good joke? Don't you
know anything else..

262
00:17:08,341 --> 00:17:10,639
..other than creating rifts?
Go away. Go to office.

263
00:17:10,743 --> 00:17:12,233
Carry on. Carry on.
- Why are you shouting at him?

264
00:17:12,345 --> 00:17:14,438
Aren't you ashamed to earn
on someone else's cars?

265
00:17:14,547 --> 00:17:15,639
Dad, if you abuse me in that way..

266
00:17:15,748 --> 00:17:16,840
..l will run away from the house.

267
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:18,644
Don't worry! No one
will miss you here.

268
00:17:18,751 --> 00:17:21,242
Of course you will, as l will
flee in that Benz car.

269
00:17:25,825 --> 00:17:27,918
What's the matter? Why
is everyone so dull?

270
00:17:28,027 --> 00:17:30,257
This morning a terrible
incident took place..

271
00:17:30,363 --> 00:17:33,264
..in Banda Ganesh's life.
He ditched us all..

272
00:17:33,366 --> 00:17:36,733
..and went to jogging this
morning to chase skirts.

273
00:17:37,036 --> 00:17:38,264
What happened then was..

274
00:17:50,716 --> 00:17:51,944
Would you like to join me?

275
00:18:02,328 --> 00:18:03,420
Will you have biscuits?

276
00:18:05,064 --> 00:18:08,295
Excuse me! Will you come
here tomorrow as well?

277
00:18:08,401 --> 00:18:10,494
We would jog together.
- That's not possible.

278
00:18:10,603 --> 00:18:13,629
Why?
- l jog only with my Peter.

279
00:18:14,006 --> 00:18:16,839
That rascal fell ill today. That's
why l asked you to join me.

280
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:20,374
So l look like your Peter?
- You look just like that.

281
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:23,307
But the only thing is that
it's my dog. - Your dog?

282
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:25,577
And right now you are eating
dog biscuits, you dog.

283
00:18:25,684 --> 00:18:26,708
Dog biscuits?

284
00:18:33,426 --> 00:18:35,394
Excuse me! Who is Subramaniam
among you?

285
00:18:38,697 --> 00:18:40,858
Two. Three. Four. Five. Six.

286
00:18:41,567 --> 00:18:43,660
Hey, l think he doesn't
know our Subramaniam.

287
00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:45,669
l will tell him that
l am Subramaniam..

288
00:18:45,771 --> 00:18:47,932
..and pocket that money.
- Don't do that. - Get lost.

289
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:53,342
Yes, l am Subramaniam.
- ls that so? - Yes.

290
00:18:54,513 --> 00:18:57,414
How dare you to write
love letter to my wife!

291
00:18:58,717 --> 00:19:00,344
You rascal! How dare you !

292
00:19:00,586 --> 00:19:03,350
l am scared to even give
electricity bill to my wife..

293
00:19:03,456 --> 00:19:06,357
..and you give her love letter?
- Not just to your wife..

294
00:19:06,459 --> 00:19:09,019
..but l won't write love letter
to my wife as well, sir. - Hey!

295
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:16,363
Beware! Or else you'll die.
- O God!

296
00:19:16,469 --> 00:19:20,769
My mouth is bleeding.
He broke my teeth.

297
00:19:21,941 --> 00:19:24,967
Why are you staring as if
a movie is going on here?

298
00:19:25,744 --> 00:19:27,644
Someone come forward
and give me a hand.

299
00:19:30,749 --> 00:19:33,980
Hello!
- l am Subramaniam speaking. - Yes.

300
00:19:34,086 --> 00:19:36,384
lf someone comes there and
asks for Subramaniam..

301
00:19:36,489 --> 00:19:39,049
..while counting money don't
say you are Subramaniam.

302
00:19:39,158 --> 00:19:42,525
Alright.
- You are too greedy.

303
00:19:42,628 --> 00:19:44,528
That's why l'm telling you.
- Alright.

304
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:47,464
Alright? l have seen everything.

''..even before the first show ends.''

''Before a movies leaves the
theatre let's rip it apart.''

324

let's sell our lab.''

334
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,827
''Before the principal catches
us let's leave the college.''

335
00:22:38,937 --> 00:22:43,101
''lf we get caught we can fall
back on our parents.''

336
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:51,638
''Before we cross this age
let's never face boredom.''

337
00:22:52,084 --> 00:23:00,184
''Before this vow comes to an end
let's see the whole world.''

338
00:23:00,292 --> 00:23:03,591
''What a fun ! What a delight!''

339
00:23:04,697 --> 00:23:07,257
''What a fun ! What a delight!''

340
00:23:08,767 --> 00:23:12,931
''What a fun ! What a delight!''

341
00:23:15,908 --> 00:23:18,843
Sir, no one can play in the
ground for a week. - Why?

342
00:23:19,011 --> 00:23:20,603
ln the nearby RTO the
meditation classes..

343
00:23:20,713 --> 00:23:22,271
..are about to start from tomorrow.
- So what?

344
00:23:22,381 --> 00:23:24,611
lf you play here the class
might get disturbed..

345
00:23:24,717 --> 00:23:27,618
..so the colony association's
secretary barred everyone..

346
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,620
..from the ground.
- Who's that secretary?

347
00:23:35,327 --> 00:23:37,192
Hey, that's the biscuit party.

348
00:23:38,964 --> 00:23:41,364
That means he's that secretary?

349
00:23:43,902 --> 00:23:46,894
Hey, get lost.
- Who are you?

350
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,635
We are celebrity figures, you know..

351
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:52,105
Your faces say that you are
good-for-nothing fellows.

352
00:23:52,211 --> 00:23:54,679
l see.
- Why? Does that sound funny? - Ya.

353
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,804
l heard that you passed
orders to stop us..

354
00:23:55,914 --> 00:23:57,313
..from playing in the playground.
- Yes, l did.

355
00:23:57,416 --> 00:23:59,316
To run the meditation classes?
- What the heck can you do..

356
00:23:59,418 --> 00:24:00,783
..if l run those classes?

357
00:24:01,353 --> 00:24:04,652
Darling.
- Yes. - l will bring biscuits.

358
00:24:04,757 --> 00:24:09,160
Not today. - No, no, no. You can
job only if you eat biscuits.

359
00:24:09,261 --> 00:24:13,197
l am eating everyday. Spare
me today. - You have to. Ok?

360
00:24:15,434 --> 00:24:17,698
Hey, he eats dog biscuits everyday.

361
00:24:19,905 --> 00:24:20,929
How did they find it out?

362
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,401
That's enough for us to
rip you apart, buddy.

363
00:24:23,909 --> 00:24:26,070
lf you conduct meditation
classes you're a dead man.

364
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:28,203
Hey, let's go.

365
00:24:31,917 --> 00:24:33,680
That secretary started
meditation classes..

366
00:24:33,786 --> 00:24:35,219
..even though we warned them.

367
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,017
Ganesh, your mom and dad
are coming this way.

368
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:42,184
Just look at my son, how
wise he has become.

369
00:24:42,294 --> 00:24:46,355
You are my sweetheart.
l am so proud of you.

370
00:24:46,465 --> 00:24:48,433
Are you learning Yoga, dear?
- Yes, mom.

371
00:24:48,767 --> 00:24:50,234
Take care of your health.

372
00:24:52,171 --> 00:24:54,435
l took after my mom. That's
why she loves me so much.

373
00:24:59,311 --> 00:25:03,839
Hey, come here. You may go.

374
00:25:04,983 --> 00:25:07,713
Hey, come here.
- Hey, what's that shirt..

375
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,720
..and what's that appearance?
- They will allow us..

376
00:25:09,822 --> 00:25:11,881
..in the meditation classes
only if we wear this.

377
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:13,787
Meditation? What's that?

378
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:16,725
Meditation means we have to
set our eyes on one point..

379
00:25:16,829 --> 00:25:19,889
Where? On that girl?
- Stop it. He's saying something.

380
00:25:19,998 --> 00:25:22,728
Carry on, sir.
- We have to breathe in..

381
00:25:22,835 --> 00:25:26,396
..and breathe out slowly.
That is it.

382
00:25:26,805 --> 00:25:28,466
Are we doing anything different
now? - You're right.

383
00:25:28,874 --> 00:25:30,171
That's the reason l never
tell you anything.

384
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:32,138
Hey, come here.

385
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,004
Rascal.

386
00:25:36,114 --> 00:25:38,275
You want meditation? Get lost.

387
00:25:38,884 --> 00:25:40,784
l'll hit you. Get lost.

388
00:25:40,953 --> 00:25:43,478
Hey, do you really need meditation?
Stand there.

389
00:25:44,389 --> 00:25:46,414
Hey, you thought of
leaving us all here..

390
00:25:46,525 --> 00:25:48,015
..and going there alone, rascal?

391
00:25:48,126 --> 00:25:49,286
What do we do with these sages now?

392
00:25:49,394 --> 00:25:51,294
There's a bike in our shed
without a silencer.

393
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:53,760
Can they conduct meditation
classes..

394
00:25:53,866 --> 00:25:56,096
..if we ride that bike here?
- Superb.

395
00:26:00,305 --> 00:26:03,763
Where must be she gone?
- Nitu, you're friend is..

396
00:26:03,876 --> 00:26:06,970
..not at home. She gave me
the keys. - Thanks, aunt.

397
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,009
Nitu, it's been a week since
that girl came here.

398
00:26:10,115 --> 00:26:11,980
She doesn't look like a girl
who mingles with everyone.

399
00:26:12,084 --> 00:26:15,383
ls that so? - Nitu, listen,
is she your childhood friend?

400
00:26:15,487 --> 00:26:17,785
Yes, aunt.
- Her mother and father..

401
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:19,858
Aunt, please. Please. l
am a bit busy right now.

402
00:26:19,958 --> 00:26:21,789
l will tell you everything
later, ok? - Alright.

403
00:27:03,936 --> 00:27:06,302
Sorry. l'm really sorry.

404
00:27:07,306 --> 00:27:09,433
Please don't mind.
- lt's ok.

405
00:27:29,494 --> 00:27:30,859
Where are the meditation
classes going on?

406
00:27:30,963 --> 00:27:31,987
Over there.

407
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:33,290
Meditation?

408
00:27:37,235 --> 00:27:38,600
Hey, what's that rush?

409
00:27:41,473 --> 00:27:44,374
Stop there. What's that?
Where are you going?

410
00:27:44,476 --> 00:27:45,875
To meditation classes, mom.
- And you need..

411
00:27:45,978 --> 00:27:48,879
..your father's shirt for that?
- Father's not important here..

412
00:27:48,981 --> 00:27:51,347
..but the shirt's important.
- What happened to him?

413
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:53,413
Why didn't he return yet?
- Yes.

414
00:27:53,518 --> 00:27:55,543
He said he would bring the
bike with broken silencer.

415
00:27:55,654 --> 00:27:56,882
What happened to him?

416
00:28:01,426 --> 00:28:03,417
Who is he roaming in our area
like Jawaharlal Nehru?

417
00:28:05,664 --> 00:28:08,565
lt's Aravind.
- Right. - Bye.

418
00:28:11,536 --> 00:28:13,561
Aravind.
- Bye.

419
00:28:13,939 --> 00:28:15,304
Aravind.
- Bye-bye!

420
00:28:16,041 --> 00:28:18,908
l am strict regarding many matters,
you know.. Hey, stop!

421
00:28:19,011 --> 00:28:20,945
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, sir. - Ok.

422
00:28:21,446 --> 00:28:22,470
Hello!

Go inside.

Why is this idiot coming this way?
- Greetings, master.

425
00:28:33,458 --> 00:28:35,926
You said you would come

..and do something, right?
- l will do meditation.

427
00:28:38,363 --> 00:28:41,594
'And he wants to do meditation
now. l know him very well.'

428
00:28:41,967 --> 00:28:44,595
'He must have seen some girl
and must have come here..'

429
00:28:44,703 --> 00:28:46,398
'..to impress her.'
- 'You got it, didn't you, dog?'

430
00:28:46,505 --> 00:28:48,939
'Send me inside or else l will
tell everyone in the city..'

431
00:28:49,041 --> 00:28:51,202
'..about those dog biscuits.
You got it?'

432
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:53,137
Yes. Go inside. Go inside.

433
00:28:54,046 --> 00:28:56,514
He's the no. 1 scoundrel
of their gang.

434
00:28:56,648 --> 00:28:58,047
Greetings, uncle.
- Greetings.

00:28:58,150 --> 00:28:59,674
How's your health now, uncle?

00:29:00,052 --> 00:29:02,384
That's good news, uncle. l shall
go inside. - Carry on.

437
00:29:03,288 --> 00:29:05,620
You know who he is? Scoundrel
no. 2 of this gang.

438
00:29:06,291 --> 00:29:10,091
He made a great sketch and is
trying to impress my girl.

439
00:29:10,195 --> 00:29:12,425
She won't fall so easily.
- She fell.

440
00:29:12,998 --> 00:29:15,967
What happened?
- Last evening l saw your daughter..

441
00:29:16,068 --> 00:29:17,968
..sitting on his bike and holding
him tight at the signal.

442
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,628
Oh ! Come on ! You must've
mistaken her.

443
00:29:19,738 --> 00:29:22,969
l too felt the same way, but your
daughter looked and said..

444
00:29:23,075 --> 00:29:25,407
Uncle, how are you?

445
00:29:27,512 --> 00:29:28,638
Did she wish you?
- Yes.

446
00:29:28,747 --> 00:29:30,715
My daughter?
- Yes. - You saw her? My daughter?

447
00:29:32,017 --> 00:29:33,245
She fell in his eyes.

448
00:29:39,191 --> 00:29:40,715
Hey, sit down.

449
00:30:08,053 --> 00:30:10,180
Excuse me! Hi!

Sir, why are you staring at me?

455
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,794
Let me meditate.

'She asked me to wait for

459
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,880
'..but didn't come yet.'

460

Oh no!

464
00:32:51,616 --> 00:32:54,380

l am so small and the car is so big.

471
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,864
Oh God!

l hope no one saw me.

474

You sit there, madam.

Hi, Miss. Dhana Lakshmi!

00:35:27,439 --> 00:35:28,463
..again and again.

501
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:34,344
O God! - What would you
like to take, madam?

502
00:35:34,813 --> 00:35:37,509
One vegetable sandwich and Pepsi.
- No.

503
00:35:37,615 --> 00:35:39,742
The sandwich tastes like
crap in this restaurant.

504
00:35:40,385 --> 00:35:43,013
Hey, come on, buddy!
- Then one Pepsi will be enough.

505
00:35:43,121 --> 00:35:44,349
Ok, madam. What do you want?

506
00:35:44,456 --> 00:35:46,083
We came together.

507
00:35:46,391 --> 00:35:47,881
First of all bring
what Dhana ordered.

508
00:35:50,395 --> 00:35:51,419
Just for fun.

509
00:35:53,565 --> 00:35:57,092
Miss. Dhana Lakshmi. Miss.
Dhana Lakshmi. - What?

510
00:35:57,402 --> 00:35:59,029
Look there. Over there.

511
00:36:01,873 --> 00:36:02,897
Oh !

512
00:36:07,745 --> 00:36:09,042
What a funny thing you know!

513
00:36:09,147 --> 00:36:10,375
Whose house did you come as a guest?

514
00:36:10,482 --> 00:36:12,040
Who told you that l am a guest?

515
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:14,778
l never saw a fairy like
you in this area before.

516
00:36:15,587 --> 00:36:17,817
l see. So you don't like it
when l talk like that, right?

517
00:36:17,922 --> 00:36:20,891
Ok, then, l never saw such an
ugly face in this place before.

518
00:36:20,992 --> 00:36:22,391
'Oh God! lt seems he won't
leave me so easily.'

519
00:36:22,594 --> 00:36:24,528
Yes, l came to my friend
Nitu's house.

520
00:36:24,629 --> 00:36:25,926
Nitu?
- You know her?

521
00:36:27,432 --> 00:36:29,423
And you..
- To tell you about me..

522
00:36:30,168 --> 00:36:34,070
l am like a king in this area.
To put it simply l am Aravind.

523
00:36:34,172 --> 00:36:36,402
Born in 1984, on Sep 4th,
my father have you know..

why l am finishing my studies..

527
00:36:46,851 --> 00:36:47,875
And doing nothing.

528
00:36:52,657 --> 00:36:55,023
What! You will do nothing.
What else can you do?

529
00:36:55,126 --> 00:36:56,957
l'll hit you. What does
that stare mean?

530
00:36:57,061 --> 00:36:59,757
Excuse me! Gentle boy. You, you..

531
00:37:02,066 --> 00:37:05,558
Come here.
- Myself? - Ya. Ya. Come. Come, sir.

532
00:37:07,605 --> 00:37:10,938
Talk slowly. What you
are talking suits us.

533
00:37:11,509 --> 00:37:13,568
You can go outside and talk
as much as you want to.

534
00:37:13,678 --> 00:37:14,702
Carry on. Please.

535
00:37:15,813 --> 00:37:17,974
You already got up?
- l need to go now.

536
00:37:18,082 --> 00:37:20,448
You know when l talk to you
l feel like l am talking..

537
00:37:20,552 --> 00:37:22,884
..to my childhood classmate.
- Classmate?

538
00:37:23,821 --> 00:37:26,449
What's that girl's name?
- Name? What shall l say?

539
00:37:26,691 --> 00:37:29,524
Meenakshi. - For how long
was she your classmate?

540
00:37:29,827 --> 00:37:31,124
'The matter is diverting
to some other direction.'

541
00:37:31,229 --> 00:37:32,924
Till fourth standard.
- And after that?

542
00:37:33,031 --> 00:37:34,464
She left. - Where? - She
got married and went to..

543
00:37:34,566 --> 00:37:36,193
..her in-laws' place.

544
00:37:43,241 --> 00:37:46,870
Ok, bye. - What's this! We are
having so much fun here.

545
00:37:46,978 --> 00:37:48,878
You want to leave?

546
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:51,471
We can talk then.
- Tomorrow we shall talk..

547
00:37:51,583 --> 00:37:54,143
..at least for an hour.
- Alright. Alright. Bye.

548
00:38:04,629 --> 00:38:06,961
''She's so beautiful.
She's so beautiful.''

549
00:38:07,065 --> 00:38:09,158
''l just can't believe my eyes.''

550
00:38:09,634 --> 00:38:12,159
''Even after l see you for so long.''

551
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:14,602
''l still can't keep
my eyes off you.''

552
00:38:14,939 --> 00:38:17,499
''She comes, she looks at me..''

553
00:38:17,609 --> 00:38:20,043
''..and she takes away my heart.''

554
00:38:20,278 --> 00:38:24,840
''l don't understand if it's
a dream or it's for real.''

555
00:38:25,617 --> 00:38:30,987
''O my beloved one! How can
you be so beautiful?''

556
00:38:31,089 --> 00:38:36,186
''O my beloved one! How can
you be so attractive?''

557
00:38:36,561 --> 00:38:41,794
''O my beloved one! How can
you be so gorgeous?''

558
00:38:41,899 --> 00:38:46,927
''O my beloved one! How
can you do this to me?''

559
00:38:47,038 --> 00:38:52,135
''Have you come to earth
from the sky for me?''

560
00:38:52,577 --> 00:38:58,277
''Will you take me to the
end of the earth?''

561
00:39:03,054 --> 00:39:05,887
''She's so beautiful.
She's so beautiful.''

562
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:08,083
''l just can't believe my eyes.''

563
00:39:08,593 --> 00:39:11,221
''Even after l see you for so long.''

564
00:39:11,329 --> 00:39:13,559
''l still can't keep
my eyes off you.''

565
00:39:51,169 --> 00:39:56,266
''O dear! O dear! You
are my princess.''

566
00:39:56,641 --> 00:40:01,340
''You are the cynosure of my eyes.''

567
00:40:05,717 --> 00:40:10,814
''..it would look like you.''

568
00:40:11,055 --> 00:40:16,288
''O baby, you are my life.
l can feel you every time.''

569
00:40:16,394 --> 00:40:21,696
''O baby, you are my life.
l can feel you every time.''

570
00:40:21,866 --> 00:40:27,099
''You give sunflowers and
daisies a huge complex.''

571
00:40:27,405 --> 00:40:32,672
''Have you come to earth
from the sky for me?''

572
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:38,177
''Will you take me to the
end of the earth?''

573
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,819
Ganesh, your mom and dad.

574
00:40:47,291 --> 00:40:50,317
Son, did you have meals?

575
00:40:50,695 --> 00:40:52,686
lf you don't have it you will
become weak and thin, son.

576
00:40:52,797 --> 00:40:55,664
Son, go and have meals.
- Won't your mom and dad..

577
00:40:55,767 --> 00:40:57,792
..sit at home? Do they roam
on Scooty all their lives?

578
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,084
Who is he? He is dominating
the stars of our area.

579
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:21,215
He is going a bit overboard, right?
- Very much.

580
00:41:26,798 --> 00:41:30,700
Hey, Shekharam, it's me Malli Babu.
- Hey, Malli!

581
00:41:31,035 --> 00:41:33,094
Where are you these days?
What are you doing?

582
00:41:33,337 --> 00:41:36,101
l have become a marriage
contractor in Kolkata.

583
00:41:36,207 --> 00:41:38,698
Marriage contractor means..
- We do everything..

584
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:41,040
..that is needed in a marriage
ceremony. A to Z service.

585
00:41:41,145 --> 00:41:44,046
l see.
- And why are you so dull?

586
00:41:44,148 --> 00:41:47,117
What shall l say?
- l am neck-deep in debts.

587
00:41:47,919 --> 00:41:49,819
l don't feel like living anymore.

588
00:41:50,354 --> 00:41:55,314
How can you talk like that
when your friend is here!

589
00:41:55,426 --> 00:41:58,884
You want to insult me? Tell
me how much you owe people.

590
00:41:59,797 --> 00:42:01,731
One lakh rupees.
- You are becoming so dull..

591
00:42:01,833 --> 00:42:03,733
..for after all one lakh rupees?
You need one lakh rupees..

592
00:42:03,835 --> 00:42:06,326
..urgently to become happy, right?

593
00:42:06,437 --> 00:42:08,405
Will you become happy if l
give you one lakh rupees?

594
00:42:08,506 --> 00:42:09,734
Just smile once.

595
00:42:13,845 --> 00:42:14,869
Forty.

596
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,004
Seventy.

597
00:42:18,783 --> 00:42:19,875
Here's your one lakh.

598
00:42:22,353 --> 00:42:23,752
Why are you staring
at me in that way?

599
00:42:23,988 --> 00:42:27,480
Can't l do this much for a friend?
Here's you one lakh.

600
00:42:27,925 --> 00:42:30,189
Throw it on their faces
and clear their debts.

601
00:42:30,361 --> 00:42:33,091
But never ever appear
dull in front of me.

602
00:42:33,197 --> 00:42:36,098
Who is he who gives one lakh rupees
to his friend just like that?

603
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,760
He looks like a very rich man.
- l will also tell him..

604
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:41,270
..a sorry tale and extract some
money from him. - No, buddy.

605
00:42:41,372 --> 00:42:44,899
Do not be greedy. You already
have lot of flashbacks.

606
00:42:45,009 --> 00:42:46,033
You have always been like that.

607
00:42:46,344 --> 00:42:48,972
Hey!
- Take it. Take it. - Stop.

608
00:42:50,181 --> 00:42:53,309
Hey, bring a hot pizza and a large
Pepsi for Mr. Malli Babu.

609
00:42:53,417 --> 00:42:55,214
Alright, sir.
- Who are you?

610
00:42:55,486 --> 00:42:57,113
You look like an over-burnt
Tandoori chicken.

611
00:42:57,221 --> 00:43:00,384
Sir, l became your fan after
l saw you helping your friend.

612
00:43:00,491 --> 00:43:02,789
You are my fan?
- Yes, sir. And l want to sponsor..

613
00:43:02,894 --> 00:43:06,386
..for such a rare scene, sir.
Hey, bring it fast.

614
00:43:06,497 --> 00:43:10,399
Also get me two King size packets.
- Ok, sir.

615
00:43:10,568 --> 00:43:12,798
The taxi's standing there.
Pay the fare.

616
00:43:13,037 --> 00:43:14,800
And when you return bring back
the bag that is there in it.

617
00:43:14,906 --> 00:43:16,464
What are you still doing here? Go.
- Ok, sir.

618
00:43:16,574 --> 00:43:19,805
Hey, buddy! Pay the
taxi fare. Please.

619
00:43:28,953 --> 00:43:32,320
Fan.
- Sir. - lt was a great treat.

620
00:43:32,423 --> 00:43:34,891
Thank you, sir. - l shall go
now then. - Wait a minute.

621
00:43:35,593 --> 00:43:38,824
Basically you are very scared
of debts, aren't you? - Yes.

622
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:40,158
Then how come you have
one lakh rupees debt?

623
00:43:40,264 --> 00:43:41,822
You know our Kishor, don't you?
- Yes.

624
00:43:41,933 --> 00:43:43,833
When he was going to Dubai..

625
00:43:43,935 --> 00:43:46,233
..l got him one lakh rupees on
credit from a money-lender.

626
00:43:46,337 --> 00:43:47,827
He disappeared with that 50 lakhs..

627
00:43:47,939 --> 00:43:50,305
..and l got trapped with this
money-lender. - Shut up!

628
00:43:51,042 --> 00:43:53,567
You forgot your status and got
someone else 50,000 rupees?

629
00:43:53,878 --> 00:43:56,369
Hey, you don't know the
value of money at all.

630
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,845
This Malli Babu can forgive
someone who doesn't know..

631
00:43:57,949 --> 00:43:59,849
..the worth of a human being,
but doesn't forgive someone..

632
00:43:59,951 --> 00:44:02,181
..who doesn't know
the worth of money.

633
00:44:02,286 --> 00:44:05,380
l don't take any responsibility
in this 50,000 rupees.

634
00:44:05,489 --> 00:44:09,050
50,000 rupees cut.
- What a twist!

635
00:44:10,962 --> 00:44:12,452
Now give me the account
for this 50,000 rupees.

636
00:44:12,563 --> 00:44:14,861
Three months ago when l
was going on my scooter..

637
00:44:14,966 --> 00:44:17,196
..l met with an accident
and got a fracture.

638
00:44:17,368 --> 00:44:21,065
l lost 10,000 rupees there. - l'll
hit you with this plate, idiot.

639
00:44:21,172 --> 00:44:22,867
Have you completely lost it?
You can't even cycle..

640
00:44:22,974 --> 00:44:24,874
..a bicycle properly
and bought a scooter?

641
00:44:24,976 --> 00:44:26,534
Again you behaved without
knowing the worth of money.

642
00:44:26,944 --> 00:44:28,878
Listen, Malli Babu might forgive
someone who doesn't..

643
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:30,880
..know the worth of a human being..
- ..but doesn't forgive..

644
00:44:30,982 --> 00:44:33,917
..someone who doesn't know the
worth of money. - Exactly.

645
00:44:34,285 --> 00:44:36,879
You lost this 10,000 as well. Next.

646
00:44:38,522 --> 00:44:40,615
l told you right in the beginning
not to get into this.

647
00:44:54,305 --> 00:44:56,034
How do you owe the remaining
10,000 rupees?

648
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:57,903
'Why? You want to
take back that as well?

649
00:44:58,009 --> 00:45:01,638
l won't let him
take this 10,000 back.'

650
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:04,575
No, Malli Babu. l am giving
you a huge trouble..

651
00:45:04,682 --> 00:45:06,149
..by telling you about my problems.

652
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:08,013
Now l understood one thing.
- What?

653
00:45:08,552 --> 00:45:10,577
lf one has a friend like
you one can solve..

654
00:45:10,688 --> 00:45:12,588
..any problem very easily.

655
00:45:13,057 --> 00:45:14,319
You boosted my confidence.

656
00:45:14,959 --> 00:45:16,517
l will solve my problem on my own.

657
00:45:16,961 --> 00:45:19,589
Say it again. Say it again.
- l'll solve my problem on my own.

658
00:45:19,697 --> 00:45:21,927
Great. Did you get it at least now!

659
00:45:22,166 --> 00:45:24,031
Malli Babu rescues those
who are in trouble..

660
00:45:24,135 --> 00:45:26,535
..and appreciate them
who have confidence.

661
00:45:26,971 --> 00:45:28,939
When you would solve your
problem on your own..

662
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,200
..you won't need this 10,000 rupees.

663
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,621
Does anyone among you needs help?
- O God!

664
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:48,356
Hey, what happened?
- Don't go there. Don't go.

665
00:45:48,993 --> 00:45:51,985
Aravind.
- Cousin. - Cousin.

666
00:45:52,096 --> 00:45:53,120
Cousin.
- Cousin.

667
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:54,390
Cousin.
- Cousin.

668
00:45:55,499 --> 00:45:57,558
Hi and hello to my sister's family.

669
00:45:57,668 --> 00:45:59,636
Brother, how are you?
- l am very fine, dear.

670
00:45:59,737 --> 00:46:01,637
When did you come?
- l came here just now, uncle.

671
00:46:01,739 --> 00:46:03,070
How is everyone?
- Just a minute. l'll bring coffee.

672
00:46:03,174 --> 00:46:05,301
No, aunt.
- Why? - l want Boost.

673
00:46:05,409 --> 00:46:07,070
Boost is the secret of his energy.

674
00:46:07,178 --> 00:46:09,305
Uncle, don't tell secrets outside.
- Ok. Ok.

675
00:46:10,347 --> 00:46:13,646
What's this nonsense! What's this
furniture and what's this hall!

676
00:46:13,751 --> 00:46:14,979
lt's pretty cheap. ls this how
a chief engineer's house..

677
00:46:15,086 --> 00:46:16,986
..should look like? A Plasma
TV on that side..

678
00:46:17,088 --> 00:46:18,988
..a 5.1 Surround system here,
stand-less sofa set this side..

679
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:20,990
..a classy dining table
and a costly carpet..

680
00:46:21,092 --> 00:46:24,027
How would it look then? - l will
be left with 50,000 rupees debt.

681
00:46:24,128 --> 00:46:25,993
What are you saying! You won't
get all these things..

682
00:46:26,097 --> 00:46:27,257
..for a paltry 50,000 rupees.
lt would cost minimum one lakh.

683
00:46:27,364 --> 00:46:28,388
Where would l get one
lakh rupees from now?

684
00:46:28,499 --> 00:46:29,523
You need one lakh rupees, right?

685
00:46:29,633 --> 00:46:34,002
Brother, please. Brother,
l am very happy here.

686
00:46:34,105 --> 00:46:37,370
Please don't take out that
one lakh and ruin my life.

687
00:46:37,475 --> 00:46:39,102
Please. Please.
- What are you saying, sister!

688
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:42,008
No. l have been watching that
one lakh rupees with you..

689
00:46:42,113 --> 00:46:44,673
..since seven years. Please
don't show me that again.

690
00:46:44,782 --> 00:46:46,682
Please.
- At least tell me what l should do.

691
00:46:47,051 --> 00:46:49,019
lf you drink Boost here you
will get late for your train.

692
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,144
So leave immediately.

693
00:46:50,421 --> 00:46:54,221
Sister. - Alright. - What?
What's the matter?

694
00:46:54,325 --> 00:46:56,691
Uncle, actually what happened
is that.. - Nothing, uncle.

695
00:46:56,794 --> 00:47:00,560
Just a small talk between brother
and sister. - l will..

696
00:47:00,664 --> 00:47:03,690
Are you talking about his one
lakh rupees? - Yes, uncle.

697
00:47:03,801 --> 00:47:06,031
l'll kill you, scoundrel. lf you
bring that one lakh rupees..

698
00:47:06,137 --> 00:47:08,765
..to this house again l
will cut you into pieces.

699
00:47:09,073 --> 00:47:10,097
Get lost. Get lost.

700
00:47:12,076 --> 00:47:14,135
Hello!
- Nitu. - What are you doing?

701
00:47:14,245 --> 00:47:16,145
l can find out what is
where in this kitchen.

702
00:47:16,247 --> 00:47:18,306
Why do you bother? l will
cook after l return.

703
00:47:22,086 --> 00:47:23,576
Nitu. Nitu.

704
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:27,648
Excuse me.
- Yes. - Where is the lCU?

705
00:47:27,758 --> 00:47:28,782
On the right.

706
00:47:34,365 --> 00:47:37,801
Sister, Nitu.
- There's nothing to worry about it.

707
00:47:38,102 --> 00:47:40,400
She will be shifted into the
room in a while. - Thank you.

708
00:47:40,504 --> 00:47:44,065
Who admitted Nitu in the hospital?
- We admitted her.

709
00:47:44,241 --> 00:47:47,108
Thanks a lot. How did this
accident take place?

710
00:47:47,211 --> 00:47:49,202
Accident? lt's a case
of eve-teasing.

711
00:47:49,313 --> 00:47:52,407
Do you know who did it?
- lt's alright. Tell me.

712
00:47:52,516 --> 00:47:55,076
lf we tell you about them you
will file police complaint..

713
00:47:55,186 --> 00:47:57,086
..about them and then we
will be in deep trouble.

714
00:47:57,188 --> 00:47:58,553
We are not on good terms with them.

715
00:47:58,656 --> 00:48:01,090
Please tell me who it is.
- lf you assure us..

716
00:48:01,192 --> 00:48:04,423
..that you won't tell anyone
that we told you this..

717
00:48:04,528 --> 00:48:06,291
l won't tell anyone.
Tell me who it is.

718
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:09,096
lt's Aravind, Subramaniam,
Venkatesh, Ganesh..

719
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,636
..Raj Babu, Karri Raju, Bobby
of H-block. lt's their batch.

720
00:48:15,606 --> 00:48:17,506
Buddy, you got Aravind
trapped in this?

721
00:48:17,608 --> 00:48:19,838
lt wasn't preplanned. l
got idea all of a sudden.

722
00:48:20,211 --> 00:48:22,702
l wanted to get even with since
a long time and today l will.

723
00:48:22,813 --> 00:48:23,837
Hey!

724
00:48:31,622 --> 00:48:34,113
Who is Aravind among you?
- lt's me.

725
00:48:35,426 --> 00:48:39,863
You think you are some goon?
l heard you are eve-teasing.

726
00:48:40,631 --> 00:48:43,122
You know a girl was admitted in
the hospital because of you.

727
00:48:43,234 --> 00:48:45,134
ln the hospital?
- You are talking as if..

728
00:48:45,236 --> 00:48:47,136
..you don't know anything.
- Sir, even if you are policeman..

729
00:48:47,238 --> 00:48:48,796
..it doesn't give you right
to hold our collars.

730
00:48:48,906 --> 00:48:51,136
What's your name?
- Subramaniam.

731
00:48:52,176 --> 00:48:54,144
Yours was the first name in the
complaint. Take him inside.

732
00:48:54,245 --> 00:48:56,179
Yes, sir. - What's your name?
- Raja Babu, sir.

733
00:48:57,181 --> 00:48:58,614
What's your name?
- Venkatesh, sir.

734
00:48:59,416 --> 00:49:00,747
What's your name? Hey!

735
00:49:01,352 --> 00:49:03,820
Ganesh, sir.
- What's your name?

736
00:49:03,921 --> 00:49:06,617
Karri Raju.
- Take them away. - Yes, sir.

737
00:49:10,394 --> 00:49:11,691
Hey!
- Sir. - Come here.

738
00:49:12,596 --> 00:49:14,154
Sir.
- Who is he sitting there..

739
00:49:14,265 --> 00:49:15,892
..even when so much is
going on over here?

740
00:49:16,333 --> 00:49:17,766
He is our gang's leader, sir.

741
00:49:44,928 --> 00:49:47,260
What? They already discharged you?

742
00:49:47,431 --> 00:49:49,797
Did you file a police complaint?
- Yes. Why?

743
00:49:49,967 --> 00:49:51,594
Who told you that
they eve-teased me?

744
00:49:51,769 --> 00:49:52,861
The guys who admitted
you in the hospital.

745
00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:55,404
Along with the help they created
a problem as well.

746
00:49:55,572 --> 00:49:57,836
What happened?
- There are two gangs in this area.

747
00:49:57,941 --> 00:50:01,206
They are arch rivals. So they
made up the eve-teasing bit..

748
00:50:01,312 --> 00:50:03,712
..and gave other gang's names.
Police bashed them up.

749
00:50:03,881 --> 00:50:05,940
You know what happened after that?

750
00:50:06,383 --> 00:50:08,681
Look, girl, who among them..

751
00:50:08,919 --> 00:50:10,819
Who among them teased them?

752
00:50:10,988 --> 00:50:12,478
l will break their remaining bones.

753
00:50:12,656 --> 00:50:14,351
Why are you standing
there? Go there..

754
00:50:14,525 --> 00:50:17,426
Go there and show your ugly
faces to that girl. Come on !

755
00:50:24,868 --> 00:50:26,495
Stop it!
- So it's him?

756
00:50:26,970 --> 00:50:29,495
Girl. - Shut up! What's
this harassment, sir!

757
00:50:29,673 --> 00:50:31,436
Did l tell you that they
were eve-teasing me?

758
00:50:31,542 --> 00:50:32,566
l don't even know who they are.

759
00:50:32,743 --> 00:50:33,971
l never even saw them before.

760
00:50:34,878 --> 00:50:37,506
We were waiting for that
one word, Mr. Sl.

761
00:50:37,681 --> 00:50:39,649
Police's atrocities on students.

762
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:41,650
Youth manhandled in the cell.

763
00:50:41,819 --> 00:50:44,253
We will file hundred
cases against you..

764
00:50:44,355 --> 00:50:47,256
..for beating us students
without valid evidence..

765
00:50:47,358 --> 00:50:50,293
..and send you behind bars.
- Hey, my uncle is MLA.

766
00:50:52,296 --> 00:50:54,264
What's this, madam? When you
don't know who they are..

767
00:50:54,365 --> 00:50:55,855
..why did you make your friend
complain about them?

768
00:50:56,033 --> 00:50:59,400
Complaint? Friend? - So your
friend complained about us?

769
00:50:59,503 --> 00:51:00,800
Who is she? Where does she live?

770
00:51:00,971 --> 00:51:03,565
How can she file complaints against
celebrity figures like us!

771
00:51:03,941 --> 00:51:06,933
He had hurt us. Tell us where
that girl lives. Which city?

772
00:51:07,044 --> 00:51:11,538
Ask her. Bring her here
in half an hour.

773
00:51:11,715 --> 00:51:13,273
One. Two. Three. Four. Five.
Without giving a gap..

774
00:51:13,384 --> 00:51:16,410
..from court to the station.
- From station to home.

775
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,351
From house to court.
- From court to station.

776
00:51:18,455 --> 00:51:20,821
We will drag her and torture
her. Come on, tell us.

777
00:51:21,058 --> 00:51:24,357
My uncle is MLA, you know that?

778
00:51:24,461 --> 00:51:27,362
O my God! What happened then?

779
00:51:27,531 --> 00:51:29,556
l hit upon a superb idea right then.

780
00:51:29,666 --> 00:51:31,657
Without getting aggressive
kindly listen to me.

781
00:51:31,769 --> 00:51:34,704
l can call that girl here
if you ask me to.

782
00:51:34,872 --> 00:51:37,898
But the problem is that she
won't remember any of you.

783
00:51:38,008 --> 00:51:41,307
Why? - She is affected
by specified amnesia.

784
00:51:41,412 --> 00:51:44,711
My uncle is MLA. - Rascal, you
don't understand English.

785
00:51:44,815 --> 00:51:48,046
Nonsense. Girl, talk in Telugu.

786
00:51:48,352 --> 00:51:52,311
Last year on 14th Dec when
she came to meet me..

787
00:51:52,423 --> 00:51:56,325
..her car met with an accident.
Poor girl, she lost her parents..

788
00:51:56,427 --> 00:51:58,554
..right there and then, but she
survived. But what's the use!

789
00:51:58,662 --> 00:52:00,323
As she got a major
blow on her head..

790
00:52:00,431 --> 00:52:02,695
..a part of her mind damaged.

791
00:52:02,866 --> 00:52:04,993
Since then she can't
remember anything.

792
00:52:05,369 --> 00:52:08,338
ls that so?
- She remembers everything..

793
00:52:08,439 --> 00:52:11,340
..that happened till Dec 14th.
But after 14th Dec..

794
00:52:11,442 --> 00:52:14,468
..whatever happens she
forgets the next day.

795
00:52:14,645 --> 00:52:16,408
Every day is a new day for her.

796
00:52:16,647 --> 00:52:19,548
Oh no! You say she forgets
today's incident tomorrow.

797
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:20,981
Then how does she remember you?

798
00:52:21,385 --> 00:52:23,945
Actually.. Actually we are
friends since childhood.

799
00:52:24,121 --> 00:52:27,022
That's how she remembers me.
After the accident..

800
00:52:27,524 --> 00:52:30,425
So she forgets everything she
sees after the accident.

801
00:52:30,727 --> 00:52:31,955
You have got a sharp mind, sir.

802
00:52:32,062 --> 00:52:36,089
lt sounds like 'Gajini' movie.
- No, sir.

803
00:52:36,433 --> 00:52:39,368
ln that story hero Surya forgets
everything every 15 minutes.

804
00:52:39,470 --> 00:52:41,370
Am l right? - Yes. - But in
this story she forgets..

805
00:52:41,472 --> 00:52:43,770
..everything every 24 hours.
- So this is a story? - Yes.

806
00:52:43,874 --> 00:52:46,638
Hey! - lt's not a story,
sir. lt's for real.

807
00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:48,944
lf you wish you can check
her X-ray report.

808
00:52:49,546 --> 00:52:51,639
X-ray? When did they take my X-ray?

809
00:52:52,683 --> 00:52:54,981
They took my leg's X-ray yesterday.
l showed them that.

810
00:52:55,085 --> 00:52:56,916
You showed the leg's X-ray
as brain's X-ray?

811
00:52:57,087 --> 00:52:59,783
Couldn't they find out?
- They are not that smart.

812
00:52:59,957 --> 00:53:01,390
They are idiots. You should've
seen their show off..

813
00:53:01,492 --> 00:53:03,983
..when they were looking at it.

814
00:53:07,831 --> 00:53:09,662
What's this! The brain is so long.

815
00:53:10,567 --> 00:53:13,434
The brain has split into two
pieces. lt's some juice.

816
00:53:13,837 --> 00:53:16,135
My heart weeps when l
think about that girl.

817
00:53:16,473 --> 00:53:19,442
So do we reach a compromise here?
- No, my uncle is MLA.

818
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:22,807
Forget it. lt's not sir's mistake.
- Thank you.

819
00:53:24,548 --> 00:53:26,778
Son.
- Yes. - What's your uncle's name?

820
00:53:26,884 --> 00:53:29,785
MLA. - What's his name?
- Metta Lingachari.

821
00:53:29,887 --> 00:53:30,911
MLA in short.

822
00:53:33,490 --> 00:53:35,117
Ok. Ok. What happened has happened.

823
00:53:35,459 --> 00:53:36,983
At least from now onwards
take care of your friend.

824
00:53:37,094 --> 00:53:38,425
Don't leave her outside
every now and then..

825
00:53:38,529 --> 00:53:39,553
..and create problems for me.

826
00:53:40,063 --> 00:53:42,827
lf this happens one more time
you know about us, don't you?

827
00:53:42,933 --> 00:53:45,424
Yes, l do.
- Be careful. Let's go.

828
00:53:45,536 --> 00:53:49,495
Hey, my X-ray.
- Will you give me your X-ray?

829
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:51,970
l need to explain my
friend about brain.

830
00:53:52,142 --> 00:53:54,610
Aren't you going a bit overboard?
- Right.

831
00:53:54,811 --> 00:53:55,835
Keep it there.

832
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:04,812
That's why l am warning
you right now..

833
00:54:04,922 --> 00:54:07,186
Don't talk to anyone
without knowing.

834
00:54:07,491 --> 00:54:09,459
Even if you talk to someone
you will have to pretend..

835
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:10,925
..as the next day as if
you don't know them.

836
00:54:11,094 --> 00:54:12,925
Especially to the guys
of this college.

837
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:15,590
lf they find out that we lied
to them we will be in trouble.

838
00:54:15,799 --> 00:54:17,994
Be careful, ok?

839
00:54:21,505 --> 00:54:23,166
Dhana, you remember
what l said, right?

840
00:54:23,507 --> 00:54:24,531
Come back straight
to home as soon as..

841
00:54:24,641 --> 00:54:25,665
..the meditation classes are over.

842
00:54:25,776 --> 00:54:28,074
Don't talk to anyone on the way.
- Ok, bye. - Bye.

843
00:54:32,249 --> 00:54:33,614
Dhana, come here.

844
00:54:34,685 --> 00:54:36,482
What? - l told you that a
gang came to the hospital..

845
00:54:36,587 --> 00:54:38,487
..and created a scene, didn't l?
He is the biggest scoundrel..

846
00:54:38,589 --> 00:54:39,613
..of that gang.

847
00:54:41,725 --> 00:54:43,488
lt's him? He came to me yesterday..

848
00:54:43,594 --> 00:54:49,089
..and gave me a hard time for
half an hour with some crap.

849
00:54:49,266 --> 00:54:52,030
God! We need to be careful with him.

850
00:54:52,202 --> 00:54:53,499
When you are in front of him..

851
00:54:53,604 --> 00:54:54,832
..behave as if you have
got memory loss problem.

852
00:54:54,938 --> 00:54:57,236
Pretend to forget everything.
- Ok.

853
00:54:59,242 --> 00:55:01,540
But he doesn't know that l am that
memory loss patient, right?

854
00:55:01,812 --> 00:55:05,578
l will take care of that. You go.
- Ok. Bye. - Bye.

855
00:55:21,164 --> 00:55:22,188
Good morning, Miss. Dhana Lakshmi.

856
00:55:22,299 --> 00:55:24,199
You know since how long l
have been waiting for you?

857
00:55:24,301 --> 00:55:26,565
Why were you waiting
for me? Who are you?

858
00:55:28,071 --> 00:55:29,538
What's the matter you
are talking as if..

859
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,540
..you don't even know me!
- And you are talking..

860
00:55:31,642 --> 00:55:33,269
..as if you know me.

861
00:55:34,878 --> 00:55:36,539
What a funny joke! What's this,
Dhanna! You and l were..

862
00:55:36,647 --> 00:55:38,911
..talking in the restaurant
yesterday itself, right?

863
00:55:39,082 --> 00:55:41,949
Didn't my friend tell you
about me that l do nothing?

864
00:55:42,185 --> 00:55:43,812
Shut up! What's this nuisance!

865
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:44,944
l don't know who you are.
lf you disturb me again..

866
00:55:45,055 --> 00:55:47,148
..l will file a police complaint
against you, ok. ldiot.

867
00:55:47,591 --> 00:55:48,615
Nonsense.

868
00:55:54,598 --> 00:55:57,567
Hello! She's the girl
who filed a complaint..

869
00:55:57,668 --> 00:56:00,967
..against you yesterday. l told
you about that girl's accident.

870
00:56:03,206 --> 00:56:04,298
Dhana Lakshmi?

871
00:56:05,942 --> 00:56:07,102
Amnesia?

872
00:56:09,212 --> 00:56:11,578
Girl, so according to
that she would forget..

873
00:56:11,682 --> 00:56:13,309
..whatever we talked yesterday?

874
00:56:14,851 --> 00:56:17,581
Yes, she forgot it. Will
you forget tomorrow..

875
00:56:17,688 --> 00:56:18,882
..what we talked today?

876
00:56:20,190 --> 00:56:22,590
How about photographing
today's incidents..

877
00:56:22,693 --> 00:56:25,753
..and showing her tomorrow?
- She's slap you.

878
00:56:26,163 --> 00:56:27,596
lf she knows about her illness..

879
00:56:27,698 --> 00:56:30,792
..she will also remember the fact
that she lost her parents.

880
00:56:30,901 --> 00:56:33,199
And it might put her life at risk.
- You are impossible.

881
00:56:33,303 --> 00:56:34,327
Stop scaring me.

882
00:56:34,671 --> 00:56:37,868
Cool. Cool. Why are you
getting so emotional?

883
00:56:38,208 --> 00:56:40,608
Don't get me wrong, girl,
but Dhana talked to me..

884
00:56:40,711 --> 00:56:43,612
..very well yesterday.
- Look, mister, l'm telling you..

885
00:56:43,714 --> 00:56:45,614
..again and again. Don't
assume things..

886
00:56:45,716 --> 00:56:46,944
..and trouble Dhana. lt's not good.

887
00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:48,950
You will have to forget
Dhana from today onwards.

888
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:50,609
lf l come to know that
something happened..

889
00:56:50,721 --> 00:56:54,020
..to Dhana Lakshmi because of
you l won't spare you. Bye.

890
00:57:08,338 --> 00:57:13,173
Hey, lit it! Lit it!

891
00:57:20,684 --> 00:57:21,708
Hey!

892
00:57:38,101 --> 00:57:39,193
Rascals!

893
00:57:40,003 --> 00:57:42,938
Don't get scared. Don't get scared.

894
00:57:44,107 --> 00:57:46,075
Listen to me.

895
00:57:48,378 --> 00:57:49,811
Look at this, sir, what
these kids did.

896
00:57:51,448 --> 00:57:52,676
Why is he staring at me in that way!

897
00:57:53,183 --> 00:57:55,413
He looks like a police officer.
Well, who cares!

898
00:57:57,854 --> 00:57:58,980
Excuse me!

899
00:58:01,324 --> 00:58:02,416
Dhana Lakshmi.

900
00:58:02,926 --> 00:58:04,723
You are..
- Lady Gajini.

901
00:58:05,028 --> 00:58:08,088
l am Aravind.
- You did a great job. - Thanks.

902
00:58:10,734 --> 00:58:12,702
Dhana, what's this! You appear
and make me happy..

903
00:58:12,803 --> 00:58:13,997
..and disappear all of sudden.

904
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:18,831
You are such a waste-fellow.
- What are you saying!

905
00:58:18,942 --> 00:58:20,705
What else should l say? She's
the one who came to you..

906
00:58:20,811 --> 00:58:22,438
..and introduced herself to
you, didn't she? - Yes.

907
00:58:22,779 --> 00:58:25,714
You should've talked smart
and befriended her..

908
00:58:25,816 --> 00:58:29,752
..and got her on your bike
and painted the town red.

909
00:58:29,853 --> 00:58:31,718
Ok, using my talent if l had
painted the town red..

910
00:58:31,822 --> 00:58:34,848
..with her on my bike,
still what's the use!

911
00:58:35,025 --> 00:58:36,390
She would've forgotten
me by the next day.

912
00:58:36,493 --> 00:58:39,985
So what! Save similar guy in
front of her again tomorrow.

913
00:58:40,163 --> 00:58:42,256
She might be impressed and
introduce herself to you.

914
00:58:42,432 --> 00:58:45,333
That's her character, isn't it?
- Wow!

915
00:58:45,802 --> 00:58:49,761
lf l save a similar guy every
day l can follow her.

916
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:52,465
That's your character.
- Well-said.

917
00:58:53,043 --> 00:58:57,343
The idea is fine, but where will
we get such a guy everyday?

918
00:58:57,447 --> 00:58:58,744
That's not a big problem.
How about someone..

919
00:58:58,849 --> 00:59:00,942
..from our gang acting
as that helpless guy?

920
00:59:01,051 --> 00:59:05,078
Who has such got such a destitute
face in our gang?

921
00:59:08,391 --> 00:59:11,360
Hey, l will kill you all.
You think l am some fool.

922
00:59:11,461 --> 00:59:12,792
Have you seen your faces in mirror?

923
00:59:12,896 --> 00:59:14,158
Everyone shares the same view.
- What view!

924
00:59:14,264 --> 00:59:16,095
Look at your face in the mirror.

925
00:59:16,333 --> 00:59:21,498
- Hey, stop it! What do you
think of our Ganesh?

926
00:59:22,405 --> 00:59:25,772
He's the one who stands
first in our gang..

927
00:59:25,876 --> 00:59:27,901
..in looks, talent and personality.

928
00:59:28,311 --> 00:59:32,907
Aravind.
- Am l right or wrong? - Yes, but..

929
00:59:33,083 --> 00:59:35,244
That's why l say you should
play that part.

930
00:59:36,219 --> 00:59:38,016
Hey, they are better than you.
At least they are direct.

931
00:59:38,121 --> 00:59:41,454
You won't play that part?
- No, l won't.

932
00:59:41,558 --> 00:59:43,788
You asked me for 5,000
rupees to go to..

933
00:59:43,894 --> 00:59:47,057
..Ocean Park next Sunday with
your girlfriend, didn't you?

934
00:59:47,230 --> 00:59:49,198
l was wondering how to
arrange that money.

935
00:59:49,933 --> 00:59:52,527
Mom said she doesn't have any
money. lt's of no use asking father.

936
00:59:53,436 --> 00:59:55,836
That means your program
is cancelled..

937
00:59:56,506 --> 01:00:00,203
What shall we do now?
- Aravind, l'll play that part.

938
01:00:00,911 --> 01:00:02,970
l will kill anyone who
tries to stop me.

939
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:06,443
You are my real friend.
My real friend.

940
01:00:07,017 --> 01:00:08,041
What, brother? Yesterday
you thrashed us..

941
01:00:08,151 --> 01:00:10,415
..and today you are giving us
money to do the same thing?

942
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:14,081
Hey, do what you are asked to do.
- Hey, are you ready?

943
01:00:15,091 --> 01:00:17,889
Hi! Hi! Hi!
- Hey, who is this new guy?

944
01:00:17,994 --> 01:00:19,825
Hey, l know him very well.
He eats leftovers..

945
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:20,954
..in wedding buffets.

946
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:25,835
Forget it. Come on. You got
everything, right? - Yes.

947
01:00:26,136 --> 01:00:28,969
We are getting late. Carry on.
- Come on.

948
01:00:31,207 --> 01:00:32,231
What?

949
01:00:35,879 --> 01:00:38,109
2,000 extra.
- Buddy..

950
01:00:40,583 --> 01:00:43,143
Help! Help!

951
01:00:43,386 --> 01:00:49,552
They are burning me.
They are burning me.

952
01:00:49,893 --> 01:00:51,292
'You all were thrashed yesterday
itself, weren't you?'

953
01:00:51,394 --> 01:00:52,452
'Still you didn't mend your ways?'

954
01:00:52,562 --> 01:00:54,393
'You all are in deep trouble.
l won't leave you.'

955
01:00:59,302 --> 01:01:00,394
O mom!

956
01:01:04,174 --> 01:01:05,198
You shut your mouth.
l knew it long ago..

957
01:01:05,308 --> 01:01:06,866
..that this would happen to him.

958
01:01:07,644 --> 01:01:11,080
Aravind, the fatso is coming.
- The girl is also coming.

959
01:01:13,416 --> 01:01:14,906
'This policeman is here
today as well?'

960
01:01:15,485 --> 01:01:17,146
'He will rip me apart if he
knows that this is an act.'

961
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:18,912
'Then l would never get
Dhana Lakshmi again.'

962
01:01:19,155 --> 01:01:21,885
'What shall l do now?
l think l should..

963
01:01:21,992 --> 01:01:23,960
..cancel the program.' Hello, sir.

964
01:01:25,462 --> 01:01:27,930
Hello again, sir.
- Aravind.

965
01:01:28,498 --> 01:01:30,932
Fatso Ganesh is coming.
- Police.

966
01:01:31,101 --> 01:01:32,432
Police?

967
01:01:33,236 --> 01:01:35,204
Run. Run.

968
01:01:35,372 --> 01:01:38,637
Hey, you ! Come here. You can
eat the chips later on.

969
01:01:38,742 --> 01:01:41,302
Hey, the girl is coming. Let's
carry on with our plan.

970
01:01:42,345 --> 01:01:46,179
Policeman is here.
- Policeman? l'll run. O God!

971
01:01:48,351 --> 01:01:49,477
Hello, sir.

972
01:01:51,087 --> 01:01:52,213
Dad, shall we go now?

973
01:01:52,389 --> 01:01:55,381
'The girl is coming this way.
The policeman is gone.'

974
01:01:55,625 --> 01:01:56,956
'Now l can continue with my plan.'

975
01:01:57,060 --> 01:01:58,391
'Aravind, go and save him.'

976
01:02:08,304 --> 01:02:09,328
Hey, stop there!

977
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:14,299
Why are you all troubling him?
- Sister. Sister.

978
01:02:14,477 --> 01:02:18,004
lf you do this again l am going
to.. Sister, l don't know anything.

979
01:02:18,181 --> 01:02:19,478
He's the one who gave
me money to do this.

980
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:24,687
Sister, he is also a set-up.

981
01:02:31,995 --> 01:02:33,019
O God!

982
01:02:48,511 --> 01:02:50,376
What's the big deal everyone
is so depressed?

983
01:02:50,547 --> 01:02:54,005
Dhana found out my drama.
How do l show her my face?

984
01:02:54,184 --> 01:02:55,208
That girl doesn't remember
today's incidents tomorrow.

985
01:02:56,052 --> 01:02:57,644
What happened?
- You are right.

986
01:02:57,754 --> 01:02:59,517
What a great brain !
What a great brain !

1023
01:08:00,390 --> 01:08:01,550
Mom.

1024

What? - You will roll on floor
laughing if l ask for something.

1025
01:08:08,364 --> 01:08:10,025
What's that?
- Leave it.

01:08:16,639 --> 01:08:19,301
Mom, please. Give me the
money for one last time.

1029
01:08:19,842 --> 01:08:21,776
Get lost. Get lost from here.

1030
01:08:22,078 --> 01:08:23,511
Came to trouble me so
early in the morning.

1031
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:26,307
'My time is not good today.'
- Hi!

1032
01:08:26,616 --> 01:08:30,712
Uncle, l will give you 500 rupees.
- Hey, rascal!

1033
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:32,317
We are giving you pocket
money as you are..

1034
01:08:32,422 --> 01:08:34,322
..going to school regularly
unlike this idiot..

1035
01:08:34,424 --> 01:08:37,052
..and you gave that money
to him? l am going to..

1036
01:08:38,961 --> 01:08:41,623
Granny, don't talk without
knowing the subject.

1037
01:08:41,798 --> 01:08:43,857
Uncle badly needs money right now.

1038
01:08:46,669 --> 01:08:48,728
Really? Why does he need that money?

1039
01:08:48,905 --> 01:08:51,931
Uncle got a girl.
- Oh no! He put me in trouble.

1040
01:08:52,375 --> 01:08:54,707
Aravind. Aravind. lntroduce
me to that girl once.

1041
01:08:55,511 --> 01:08:57,638
You don't finance me but
you want to meet my girl?

1042
01:09:00,616 --> 01:09:02,584
Hey, please show us the girl.

1043
01:09:02,685 --> 01:09:04,346
You can't see her just like
that. lt will cost you.

1044
01:09:04,454 --> 01:09:06,888
We are ready to pay.
- Ok, get ready with 1,000 rupees.

1045
01:09:06,989 --> 01:09:08,479
l will show her at
Ameerpet bus-stop.

1046
01:09:08,658 --> 01:09:10,489
Does she sell fruits there?
- Jealousy?

1047
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:13,424
Hey, don't disturb me.
- Alright, brother.

1048
01:09:13,796 --> 01:09:17,892
Mom, look at him.
- Aravind, stop there.

1049
01:09:19,402 --> 01:09:21,563
Hey, you are giving such a
build-up in front of them?

1050
01:09:22,071 --> 01:09:24,733
You put so much effort each
day to meet that girl.

1051
01:09:25,141 --> 01:09:26,904
How will you manage them all now?

1052
01:09:27,009 --> 01:09:29,910
Tomorrow l will talk to that
girl with their help itself.

1053
01:09:36,419 --> 01:09:39,411
Mom, she's coming.

1054
01:09:48,764 --> 01:09:49,788
'lt's him?'

1055
01:09:49,966 --> 01:09:52,059
Who are you? Why are
sitting next to me?

1056
01:09:52,168 --> 01:09:55,660
Talk slowly. You are in
great danger right now.

1057
01:09:55,838 --> 01:09:58,568
l sat here only to save you.
- What's that danger?

1058
01:09:58,841 --> 01:10:00,468
l'm Aravind. Your good name please.

1059
01:10:01,444 --> 01:10:02,809
'He got started all over again.'

1060
01:10:03,813 --> 01:10:07,476
Dhana Lakshmi. - Miss. Dhana
Lakshmi, look back once.

1061
01:10:11,521 --> 01:10:14,012
Who are they all? Why
are they smiling at me?

1062
01:10:14,190 --> 01:10:16,556
l'll tell you. Now
look in the front.

1063
01:10:18,027 --> 01:10:20,052
Hi.
- Who is she?

1064
01:10:20,463 --> 01:10:22,021
They are a chain-snatching gang.

1065
01:10:22,465 --> 01:10:24,433
The moment you get down the bus
they will talk to you nicely..

1066
01:10:24,534 --> 01:10:27,731
..and then they will drug you
and then snatch your chain.

1067
01:10:27,904 --> 01:10:30,031
How do you know that?
- Theirs is a big gang.

1068
01:10:30,139 --> 01:10:31,834
l know this area very well.

1069
01:10:32,008 --> 01:10:33,839
'ls he telling the truth?'

1070
01:10:34,143 --> 01:10:37,169
'What if they are real thieves?'
what shall l do now?

1071
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:39,880
Not too much. When you get down
the bus just hold my hand.

1072
01:10:40,082 --> 01:10:41,447
They will think you came
here with someone known..

1073
01:10:41,551 --> 01:10:44,520
..and stop chasing you. l'm getting
down at the next stop.

1074
01:10:44,887 --> 01:10:46,855
l will also come.
- Hold my hand while you get down.

1075
01:10:46,956 --> 01:10:48,480
Only then will they understand
that we are pretty close.

1076
01:11:06,175 --> 01:11:07,506
Bye.

1077
01:11:18,521 --> 01:11:19,545
Mother-in-law.

1078
01:11:27,730 --> 01:11:30,164
'These chain-snatchers came
to the temple as well.'

1079
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,798
'Other than buses and trains they
steal in temples as well?'

1080
01:11:35,571 --> 01:11:40,031
Oh no! My chain?
- 'Chain? They must've stolen it.'

1081
01:11:40,576 --> 01:11:44,103
Mom. - Yes. What? - Mom,
l can't see my chain.

1082
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:45,838
Where did you drop it?
- Somewhere around.

1083
01:11:45,948 --> 01:11:49,907
Oh no! lt's 44 gm chain.
- Did l say it's 22 gm chain?

1084
01:11:50,086 --> 01:11:53,112
Aravind. - Yes, sister-in-law.
- Sister-in-law?

1085
01:11:53,289 --> 01:11:55,120
Your brother lost his
chain somewhere around.

1086
01:11:55,224 --> 01:11:56,521
Search it for him.
- He doesn't know anything..

1087
01:11:56,626 --> 01:11:58,924
..except losing thing, mom.
- Mom?

1088
01:12:00,630 --> 01:12:04,122
'Rascal, you call your mom
and your family thieves?'

1089
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:05,999
'You will rot in hell.'

1090
01:12:09,171 --> 01:12:12,937
Sister-in-law, here's the chain.
- Thanks, Aravind.

1091
01:12:13,042 --> 01:12:14,873
l would've been in deep trouble
had l lost the chain.

1092
01:12:15,077 --> 01:12:16,806
l know very well why you
came to the temple.

1093
01:12:16,979 --> 01:12:19,209
To search the chain?
- Stop kidding.

1094
01:12:19,582 --> 01:12:21,675
You called your darling here,
didn't you? - Darling?

1095
01:12:26,622 --> 01:12:28,146
You finally found it even
though l acted ignorant.

1096
01:12:28,324 --> 01:12:31,020
lntroduce us to her at least now.
- lntroduction?

1097
01:12:33,763 --> 01:12:36,197
lntroduction?
- Yes. - ln a moment.

1098
01:12:36,599 --> 01:12:39,295
Excuse me! l am Aravind.
Your good name please.

1099
01:12:39,602 --> 01:12:42,571
What's the matter?
- Both good people and bad people..

1100
01:12:42,672 --> 01:12:44,572
..come to a temple. Some
good people lost this..

1101
01:12:44,674 --> 01:12:46,904
..good chain at a good place and
a good person like me got it.

1102
01:12:47,009 --> 01:12:48,033
So l guessed that some good person
must've dropped it here..

1103
01:12:48,144 --> 01:12:49,168
..and thought that it would
be yours who look best..

1104
01:12:49,278 --> 01:12:50,575
..among everyone present here.
Check if this good chain belongs..

1105
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:51,704
..to your good neck.

1106
01:12:51,814 --> 01:12:53,577
'Rascal, you are trying
to talk to me..'

1107
01:12:53,683 --> 01:12:55,207
'..with the excuse of this chain?'

1108
01:12:55,618 --> 01:12:57,586
'l don't even get proper
abuses to abuse you..'

1109
01:12:57,687 --> 01:12:58,711
'..who calls his family
members thieves.'

1110
01:12:59,121 --> 01:13:02,284
'l will definitely teach
you a lesson.'

1111
01:13:03,225 --> 01:13:04,624
Yes, it's mine.

1112
01:13:06,028 --> 01:13:07,154
Hello.

1113
01:13:13,135 --> 01:13:15,865
What's this, Aravind, your
darling is leaving?

1114
01:13:16,038 --> 01:13:17,596
You won't introduce her to us?
- God is dying with hunger..

1115
01:13:17,707 --> 01:13:20,904
..and the priest wants the holy
offering. - Holy offering?

1116
01:13:21,077 --> 01:13:22,806
What happened? ls she
upset with you? - Yes.

1117
01:13:23,179 --> 01:13:25,340
Alright. Alright. Give me my chain.
- Which chain?

1118
01:13:25,681 --> 01:13:27,012
The one you took from me just now.

1119
01:13:27,183 --> 01:13:29,947
Do you have any evidence?
- Evidence?

1120
01:13:30,386 --> 01:13:32,616
Hey, you think it's funny.
- Your husband lost it..

1121
01:13:32,722 --> 01:13:35,691
..and you are asking for
that chain? - l see.

1122
01:13:35,858 --> 01:13:36,882
So you are coming in that route?

1123
01:13:36,992 --> 01:13:38,619
Alright. Alright. Let it be.
That chain is not mine..

1124
01:13:38,728 --> 01:13:41,219
..but it's your sister's chain.
She will come here next week.

1125
01:13:41,997 --> 01:13:43,021
lt's sister's chain.

1126
01:13:43,199 --> 01:13:45,895
Where is it? Where is my chain?

1127
01:13:46,068 --> 01:13:49,834
Will you give me the chain
or will you die?

1128
01:13:50,005 --> 01:13:51,302
Oh God!

1129
01:13:52,208 --> 01:13:54,642
Enough of that. Stop it.
My body starts burning..

1130
01:13:54,744 --> 01:13:57,941
..when l think of the cheap
tricks he does to talk to me.

1131
01:13:58,180 --> 01:14:00,375
Does anyone call his
family members fraud?

1132
01:14:00,916 --> 01:14:03,384
He will come. He will definitely
come here for the chain.

1133
01:14:07,323 --> 01:14:08,654
Here he is. Give him a harsh
warning and tell him..

1134
01:14:08,758 --> 01:14:11,386
..l am not here and
send him away, ok.

1135
01:14:12,862 --> 01:14:14,386
Hi, Miss. Nitu ! How are you?
- What's the matter?

1136
01:14:14,697 --> 01:14:15,925
Tirupati's holy offering.
- Give it to me.

1137
01:14:16,098 --> 01:14:19,067
We shouldn't offer it to someone
outside. - Ok, come in.

1138
01:14:20,836 --> 01:14:23,930
Wow! What a beautiful home!
- And then..

1139
01:14:24,106 --> 01:14:26,199
Your friend took a chain from me.
- ls it a gift?

1140
01:14:26,375 --> 01:14:28,900
lt's not my chain to gift it.
- So it's hers?

1141
01:14:29,078 --> 01:14:30,875
lt's not hers as well. She took
it assuming it to be hers.

1142
01:14:31,046 --> 01:14:33,014
The person whom that chain
belongs to is torturing me.

1143
01:14:33,249 --> 01:14:35,683
l already told you once
not to follow her..

1144
01:14:35,785 --> 01:14:38,310
..but you didn't listen to me.
- Please, girl, my chain.

1145
01:14:38,754 --> 01:14:41,348
Alright, l will give you the
chain, but one condition.

1146
01:14:41,457 --> 01:14:43,687
You shouldn't see her, you
shouldn't follow her..

1147
01:14:43,793 --> 01:14:45,727
..you shouldn't talk
to her. ls that all?

1148
01:14:45,895 --> 01:14:48,693
So you don't want the chain.
- From now onwards l won't..

1149
01:14:48,798 --> 01:14:50,698
..look at Dhana Lakshmi,
l won't follow her..

1150
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,768
..and l won't talk to her.
Hi, l am Aravind. - Hey!

1151
01:14:53,235 --> 01:14:54,896
Who is he?
- You don't know him. You go.

1152
01:14:56,238 --> 01:14:58,433
Please give me my chain back.

1153
01:14:58,774 --> 01:15:01,743
Leave this place and
don't turn around.

1154
01:15:02,144 --> 01:15:04,271
lf you don't mind will you
please come here once!

1155
01:15:04,446 --> 01:15:07,040
What for? - Please. Tell me
what for. - Please, please.

1156
01:15:07,216 --> 01:15:08,740
Tell me what it is.
- Please tell me.

1157
01:15:08,918 --> 01:15:10,283
What is it?
- Please come, madam.

1158
01:15:10,452 --> 01:15:11,749
Tell me why you called me out.

1159
01:15:11,987 --> 01:15:13,113
What's the matter you are
talking about rules!

1160
01:15:13,355 --> 01:15:14,754
You want me to stop following Dhana?

1161
01:15:14,924 --> 01:15:17,119
Should l follow you then?
l'll hit you hard.

1162
01:15:17,426 --> 01:15:19,986
Look, l love Dhana
Lakshmi sincerely.

1163
01:15:20,162 --> 01:15:22,323
For l have love, pyar, kadhal,
everything..

1164
01:15:22,498 --> 01:15:25,126
l want to marry her and l will.

1165
01:15:25,301 --> 01:15:26,962
You can do whatever you can
do to stop me. Get lost.

1166
01:15:37,346 --> 01:15:38,472
You love me?

1167
01:15:39,849 --> 01:15:41,214
You want to marry me as well?

1168
01:15:42,384 --> 01:15:45,285
Sorry, l don't like all these
things. - But Dhana Lakshmi..

1169
01:15:45,387 --> 01:15:46,752
You must be thinking that
this girl with amnesia..

1170
01:15:46,856 --> 01:15:49,484
..would talk just like that.
- No, that's not the thing..

1171
01:15:49,792 --> 01:15:52,488
As you think l don't have
any short term memory loss.

1172
01:15:55,531 --> 01:15:58,398
l remember all the stupid things
you did all these days.

1173
01:15:59,535 --> 01:16:01,025
l don't want to talk to you anymore.

1174
01:16:01,871 --> 01:16:02,895
Get lost from here.

1175
01:16:11,547 --> 01:16:13,310
Hey, you ! Have you gone mad or what!

1176
01:16:13,415 --> 01:16:14,439
Why did you tell him the truth?

1177
01:16:14,817 --> 01:16:16,785
Don't worry. Except in my matter..

1178
01:16:16,886 --> 01:16:19,821
..Aravind is a good fellow
in the rest of the things.

1179
01:16:20,422 --> 01:16:23,186
l will convince him.
You don't worry.

1180
01:16:23,492 --> 01:16:25,289
Oh ! Brother, what's this!

1181
01:16:25,461 --> 01:16:27,088
What did l tell you and
what are you doing!

1182
01:16:27,329 --> 01:16:28,387
l ask you to turn it that side and
you are turning it this side.

1183
01:16:28,931 --> 01:16:30,091
lt's after all a Luna, brother.

1184
01:16:30,332 --> 01:16:32,823
You are taking one week
to put a chain to this.

1185
01:16:33,002 --> 01:16:35,800
l don't understand when you will
go to a scooter from Luna..

1186
01:16:35,905 --> 01:16:38,840
..and from scooter to car
and maintain this shed?

1187
01:16:38,941 --> 01:16:40,909
No, brother. l really don't get it.
- Hey!

1188
01:16:41,210 --> 01:16:43,337
l am already not in a good mood.
lf you shout too much..

1189
01:16:48,517 --> 01:16:51,350
Brother.
- What? - Look, someone's there.

1190
01:16:54,456 --> 01:16:57,857
Where has he gone? Hey,
ask her what she wants.

1191
01:17:00,195 --> 01:17:01,457
Excuse me, any problem?

1192
01:17:01,864 --> 01:17:03,422
l will talk to the chief mechanic.

1193
01:17:07,269 --> 01:17:08,964
She wants chief mechanic.

1194
01:17:15,377 --> 01:17:17,538
What's the matter?
- l need to talk to you.

1195
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:19,313
l don't need to talk to anyone.

1196
01:17:26,889 --> 01:17:27,913
What's the problem, girl?

1197
01:17:28,157 --> 01:17:29,590
The scooter stopped all of a sudden.

1198
01:17:35,297 --> 01:17:36,321
Hey, did you drop some change here..

1199
01:17:36,432 --> 01:17:38,127
..that you are searching here.
- No, father.

1200
01:17:38,233 --> 01:17:39,860
l am just checking the engine.
- What!

1201
01:17:40,369 --> 01:17:44,465
You're checking the engine?
Rascal. Scoundrel. ldiot.

1202
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:46,870
Since a week you couldn't even
put a chain to that Luna..

1203
01:17:46,976 --> 01:17:49,945
..and you are checking
the engine. You rascal.

1204
01:17:50,212 --> 01:17:52,874
Father, talk slowly.
- You want me to talk slowly?

1205
01:17:52,982 --> 01:17:54,882
You are raising your voice
at me? What's that look!

1206
01:17:55,050 --> 01:17:57,484
Customers are waiting there
and you are standing here?

1207
01:17:57,653 --> 01:18:00,213
Go and deliver that lnnova
to Mr. Acharya in Ameerpet.

1208
01:18:00,322 --> 01:18:02,916
Go. Go.
- Ok. - Go l said.

1209
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:08,926
Uncle, l too need to go to
Ameerpet. lt's very urgent.

1210
01:18:09,298 --> 01:18:11,493
Please tell him to drop me there.

1211
01:18:12,170 --> 01:18:14,570
Hey, you are going to Ameerpet,
aren't you?

1212
01:18:14,673 --> 01:18:17,369
Drop this girl there. - lt's not
our vehicle, but it's customer's.

1213
01:18:17,542 --> 01:18:18,975
We can't drive people around in it.

1214
01:18:19,144 --> 01:18:20,338
And you are telling me that?

1215
01:18:20,512 --> 01:18:23,709
Shut your mouth and do what
l say. You go with him, girl.

1216
01:18:29,388 --> 01:18:33,188
Look, Aravind, did l tell you
that l have got memory loss?

1217
01:18:33,625 --> 01:18:40,030
My friend told you so. How
can you blame me for that!

1218
01:18:40,198 --> 01:18:41,995
My only mistake is hiding her lie.

1219
01:18:43,268 --> 01:18:45,998
Think about it once. When
we go to a new place..

1220
01:18:46,104 --> 01:18:49,039
..we don't know how
people are there.

1221
01:18:50,175 --> 01:18:53,542
We should behave how our friends
tell us to do, right?

1222
01:18:54,646 --> 01:18:56,546
That's what happened in my case too.

1223
01:18:57,149 --> 01:19:00,016
Please, Aravind. lf l hurt
you without my knowledge..

1224
01:19:00,118 --> 01:19:02,177
..l am extremely sorry.

1225
01:19:03,388 --> 01:19:07,222
Let's forget this matter here
itself. We are friends, ok?

1226
01:19:10,328 --> 01:19:13,297
Look, l don't love a girl
whom l call friend.

1227
01:19:13,532 --> 01:19:15,762
And l can't be friends
with a girl l love.

1228
01:19:16,802 --> 01:19:22,069
l love you. Talk to me if it's
ok with you, or else goodbye.

1229
01:19:22,808 --> 01:19:24,673
Ok, goodbye.

1230
01:19:35,187 --> 01:19:38,179
Hey, there's Dhana. Stop
the van. Stop it.

1231
01:19:42,661 --> 01:19:43,787
Hey!

1232
01:19:47,766 --> 01:19:50,667
Please, please start the car.
- l don't want to hear 'please'.

1233
01:19:50,836 --> 01:19:53,327
l will start the car only
if you agree to love me.

1234
01:19:57,576 --> 01:19:59,134
Hey, stop there.

1235
01:20:01,179 --> 01:20:02,271
Get her.

1236
01:20:11,623 --> 01:20:13,090
Get into the van. Everyone
is tensed for you there..

1237
01:20:13,191 --> 01:20:16,422
..and you are enjoying here?
Get into the van.

1238
01:20:16,595 --> 01:20:18,495
Sir, sir, sir. Sir, who are you?

1239
01:20:18,663 --> 01:20:21,632
Why are you dragging the girl with
you? - Who are you? Kill him.

1240
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:22,824
Leave me.

1241
01:20:24,803 --> 01:20:25,827
Aravind.

1242
01:20:41,820 --> 01:20:42,844
Leave me.

1243
01:20:44,756 --> 01:20:45,780
Aravind.

1244
01:20:47,292 --> 01:20:48,316
Aravind.

1245
01:21:35,273 --> 01:21:36,297
Who are they all?

1246
01:21:37,475 --> 01:21:38,908
What's the relation
between them and you?

1247
01:21:57,562 --> 01:22:01,396
Marriage against my wish.
l don't know where Balaraju is.

1248
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:06,930
l fled from my home and came
to my friend's place.

1249
01:22:07,639 --> 01:22:09,937
Now they found out that l am here.

1250
01:22:10,775 --> 01:22:12,800
l don't know what l should do.

1251
01:22:13,645 --> 01:22:16,614
Ever since childhood there
was Balaji in my heart.

1252
01:22:17,248 --> 01:22:21,685
That's why l'm telling you. Please,
Aravind, forget me.

1253
01:22:22,854 --> 01:22:23,878
Please.

1254
01:22:51,522 --> 01:22:53,547
Where is Balaji?
- Balaji?

1255
01:22:54,058 --> 01:22:55,616
There is no one here with that name.

1256
01:22:57,929 --> 01:23:01,558
Listen, your son kidnapped
my daughter Dhana Lakshmi.

1257
01:23:02,133 --> 01:23:06,467
Ask him to leave her or else
it would be very bad for you.

1258
01:23:06,671 --> 01:23:08,832
Madam, l don't understand
what you are saying.

1259
01:23:09,073 --> 01:23:13,100
Balaji? Kidnap? We are not that
sort of people, l swear.

1260
01:23:13,211 --> 01:23:15,509
Even if you swear a lie
don't become true.

1261
01:23:16,547 --> 01:23:19,914
Weren't you living in
Nellore 12 years ago?

1262
01:23:20,084 --> 01:23:23,645
l in Nellore? We are living
here since last 30 years.

1263
01:23:23,755 --> 01:23:26,053
No, sister. lt's his son
who has beaten up.

1264
01:23:26,557 --> 01:23:27,990
And that girl is roaming with him.

1265
01:23:28,192 --> 01:23:31,025
Listen, we didn't kidnap Dhana
Lakshmi as you think.

1266
01:23:31,162 --> 01:23:34,188
She lives with her friend
in lV-Block, house no. 17.

1267
01:23:39,170 --> 01:23:42,799
What's the matter you got
a shock? How dare you !

1268
01:23:43,574 --> 01:23:46,600
You fled from there
and reached here?

1269
01:23:46,911 --> 01:23:48,538
Get ready.
- l won't come.

1270
01:23:49,047 --> 01:23:51,743
Come.
- Stop. Stop.

1271
01:23:52,116 --> 01:23:55,210
Madam. Madam, she doesn't
want to come.

1272
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:58,011
Please leave her.
- Get lost.

1273
01:24:04,062 --> 01:24:05,893
Hello! Hello! Hello!
What's the matter?

1274
01:24:06,064 --> 01:24:08,089
Where are you talking that girl
to? Who are you by the way?

1275
01:24:08,199 --> 01:24:10,497
Sir, sir, sir, she is my daughter.
She is eloping with someone..

1276
01:24:10,601 --> 01:24:13,536
..and l am trying to stop her
and take her back to home.

1277
01:24:13,671 --> 01:24:16,504
She's lying, sir. l am a major.
She's trying to get me married..

1278
01:24:16,607 --> 01:24:18,507
..against my wish.
- We won't force her this marriage..

1279
01:24:18,609 --> 01:24:20,509
..if she doesn't want to, but
since she left the home..

1280
01:24:20,611 --> 01:24:23,239
..people are saying different
things about me.

1281
01:24:23,614 --> 01:24:25,548
l will do the enquiry
and solve the problem.

1282
01:24:26,150 --> 01:24:27,515
But if you try to force
her against her wish..

1283
01:24:27,618 --> 01:24:31,247
..l will have to take serve
action against you. Beware!

1284
01:24:31,756 --> 01:24:33,917
You go inside, girl.
- Come in. - Thank you, sir.

1285
01:24:37,628 --> 01:24:39,255
Sister, he's the one
l was talking about.

1286
01:24:41,632 --> 01:24:42,656
Ok, sir.
- lt's alright.

1287
01:24:49,841 --> 01:24:50,865
Stop there.

1288
01:24:51,642 --> 01:24:53,075
You can't come to this
house from now onwards.

1289
01:24:53,177 --> 01:24:55,270
Father, l haven't done anything
wrong as you think.

1290
01:24:55,646 --> 01:24:57,136
l just helped a girl
who was in trouble.

1291
01:24:57,248 --> 01:24:58,613
Why don't you do that much
help to us as well?

1292
01:24:58,783 --> 01:25:00,808
lf you stop coming home we will
live with some respect.

1293
01:25:01,052 --> 01:25:02,144
What do you think of this house!

1294
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:03,948
This is a house where
well-respected women live.

1295
01:25:04,655 --> 01:25:06,555
Father, please listen to me. No
one will come to out house..

1296
01:25:06,657 --> 01:25:09,023
..from now onwards. We won't
face any problem from them.

1297
01:25:09,127 --> 01:25:10,287
You shouldn't be staying here.

1298
01:25:10,595 --> 01:25:12,563
Go to Kolkata immediately
and stay with Malli Babu..

1299
01:25:12,663 --> 01:25:14,153
..and find some job.
- Father, all of a sudden?

1300
01:25:14,332 --> 01:25:16,300
Few good things happen in
life all of a sudden.

1301
01:25:16,868 --> 01:25:18,301
That's not the thing, father.
- Just do what l said.

1302
01:25:25,877 --> 01:25:27,174
Aravind, come and have dinner.

1303
01:25:27,879 --> 01:25:29,574
What? Why?
- l can't bear the fact..

1304
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:32,843
..that Dhana Lakshmi loves someone
else, sister-in-law.

1305
01:25:36,220 --> 01:25:39,986
Hey, are you mad or what! Love?
You know what love is?

1306
01:25:40,658 --> 01:25:43,991
One doesn't even know the meaning
of love in fourth class.

1307
01:25:44,295 --> 01:25:46,058
She lost her mother
when she was small.

1308
01:25:46,230 --> 01:25:48,198
She didn't get mother's
love since childhood.

1309
01:25:48,366 --> 01:25:50,596
Due to fear of her aunt her
neighbors must also have..

1310
01:25:50,701 --> 01:25:52,601
..kept her away. And she must
have become friends..

1311
01:25:52,703 --> 01:25:55,604
..with Balaji at that time.
He must've shown affection..

1312
01:25:55,706 --> 01:25:58,072
..and she must've mistaken
that affection for love.

1313
01:25:58,242 --> 01:26:01,211
So that is not love?
- Definitely not.

1314
01:26:02,113 --> 01:26:05,344
You need not go to Kolkata
as father-in-law said.

1315
01:26:05,783 --> 01:26:06,807
Continue with it. Dhana
Lakshmi is yours.

1316
01:26:33,411 --> 01:26:40,374
''O my love! O my love! O my love!''

1317
01:26:40,885 --> 01:26:47,381
''Don't keep your eyes off me.''

1318
01:26:48,292 --> 01:26:55,664
''My heart is filled
with my desires..''

1319
01:26:55,766 --> 01:27:01,727
''..and make me lust after you.''

1320
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:09,937
''O my love! O my love! O my love!''

1321
01:27:10,248 --> 01:27:17,086
''Don't keep your eyes off me.''

1322
01:27:53,024 --> 01:27:59,987
''Light is far away.''

1323
01:28:00,231 --> 01:28:07,194
''Darkness is about to
cover this place.''

1324
01:28:07,371 --> 01:28:09,737
''Hey, moonlight is falling on me..''

1325
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:14,800
''..even though the moon
is covered with clouds.''

1326
01:28:14,979 --> 01:28:18,142
''My shadow is with you.''

1327
01:28:18,849 --> 01:28:21,875
''lt doesn't want to come with me.''

1328
01:28:29,927 --> 01:28:36,491
''O my love! O my love! O my love!''

1329
01:28:37,201 --> 01:28:44,164
''Don't keep your eyes off me.''

1330
01:29:17,975 --> 01:29:25,074
''The eyes that look at the shore
are stuck in the sea.''

1331
01:29:25,249 --> 01:29:32,155
''The heart floating on the
flowers is stuck in doubt.''

1332
01:29:32,323 --> 01:29:39,559
''The breeze that touched
you is making me crazy.''

1333
01:29:40,131 --> 01:29:46,434
''Your beloved one is
entirely yours now.''

1334
01:29:54,945 --> 01:30:01,578
''O my love! O my love! O my love!''

1335
01:30:02,286 --> 01:30:09,124
''Don't keep your eyes off me.''

1336
01:30:34,518 --> 01:30:37,351
Aravind. Aravind.

1337
01:30:38,522 --> 01:30:42,288
Sorry. You fell in troubles
because of me. - Forget it.

1338
01:30:42,593 --> 01:30:45,289
You look very beautiful in
this orange color dress.

1339
01:30:48,065 --> 01:30:49,430
So you are still in love with me?

1340
01:30:50,067 --> 01:30:53,503
O God! l love orange color.

1341
01:30:53,671 --> 01:30:56,037
Not just you, but l like anyone
who wears that color.

1342
01:30:56,207 --> 01:30:57,504
Look even the drink l am drinking
is orange in color.

1343
01:30:59,009 --> 01:31:01,375
Subbu, bring two Pizzas
and one coke. - For whom?

1344
01:31:01,545 --> 01:31:02,569
For you, of course.

1345
01:31:03,547 --> 01:31:05,640
Why are you laughing?
- No, there's nothing.

1346
01:31:07,017 --> 01:31:08,041
Tell me it's ok.

1347
01:31:08,619 --> 01:31:10,917
lf it was Balaji in your place
he would've first asked me..

1348
01:31:11,021 --> 01:31:13,649
..what l would like to take
and then he would've ordered.

1349
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:17,987
You missed such a great chance.

1350
01:31:19,630 --> 01:31:21,063
What an interesting character!

1351
01:31:21,365 --> 01:31:24,391
Tell me more about Balaji.
- About Balaji?

1352
01:31:27,037 --> 01:31:30,529
Balaji was very active.
He's a very nice boy.

1353
01:31:30,708 --> 01:31:33,074
Such a sweet guy. He
used to die for me.

1354
01:31:33,244 --> 01:31:36,475
He used to be so stylist even
at that age. - Got it.

1355
01:31:36,714 --> 01:31:39,547
l got Balaji. Who else does have
that energy and that style?

1356
01:31:39,717 --> 01:31:41,207
lt must be style-star Allu Arjun.

1357
01:31:44,121 --> 01:31:46,351
lt sounds funny to you?
- Sorry.

1358
01:31:46,590 --> 01:31:48,023
Allu Arjun is a movie-star, right?

1359
01:31:49,326 --> 01:31:51,487
Dhana. Dhana. Dhana. Please, Dhana.

1360
01:31:51,662 --> 01:31:52,686
Dhana, stop there.

1361
01:31:52,997 --> 01:31:55,363
Buddy, we went to SSC
board as you told us.

1362
01:31:55,533 --> 01:31:57,967
ln five days we will get the
details of all the Balajis..

1363
01:31:58,068 --> 01:32:00,969
..who wrote SSC exams in 2002
and in which colleges..

1364
01:32:01,071 --> 01:32:04,507
..they are studying now.
- Tell that to that girl.

1365
01:32:06,076 --> 01:32:07,976
Now what's that look. l am
not doing that because..

1366
01:32:08,078 --> 01:32:09,238
..l don't have anything
worthwhile to do..

1367
01:32:09,346 --> 01:32:10,711
..but because l want to
unite you with Balaji.

1368
01:32:11,081 --> 01:32:13,709
l'm sorry, Aravind.
- You don't worry about Balaji.

1369
01:32:14,084 --> 01:32:16,518
l will find out very soon where
he is. - Thank you, Aravind.

1370
01:32:16,687 --> 01:32:18,712
You are taking so much
trouble for me.

1371
01:32:19,089 --> 01:32:22,252
That is the least l could
do for you. You carry on.

1372
01:32:22,426 --> 01:32:24,053
Ok, bye. Bye.

1373
01:32:26,630 --> 01:32:29,064
Buddy, we lied to her that we
will be searching Balaji.

1374
01:32:29,233 --> 01:32:30,461
What if she asks us tomorrow
where that Balaji is?

1375
01:32:30,634 --> 01:32:33,000
Pretty simple. l will weave
some stories and tell her..

1376
01:32:33,103 --> 01:32:35,037
..that he is here and there and
in that time l'll impress her.

1377
01:32:35,239 --> 01:32:38,003
Then one day l will tell her
that he became a sage..

1378
01:32:38,108 --> 01:32:41,737
..and make my love a success.
She wants Balaji.

1379
01:32:45,249 --> 01:32:47,615
So you have such filthy
ideas in your mind?

1380
01:32:49,119 --> 01:32:52,748
Even after knowing that l love
someone else you love me?

1381
01:32:54,191 --> 01:32:57,024
Aren't you ashamed
to think that way?

1382
01:32:59,129 --> 01:33:01,029
Ok, l won't let my
mind contaminate..

1383
01:33:01,131 --> 01:33:04,032
..with such filthy thoughts. l
will directly find a place..

1384
01:33:04,134 --> 01:33:06,432
..in your heart.
- That won't happen till l am alive.

1385
01:33:06,537 --> 01:33:08,027
Don't talk like a fool. lf you
talk and play with someone..

1386
01:33:08,138 --> 01:33:11,767
..when you were a kid that
doesn't mean you love him.

1387
01:33:12,810 --> 01:33:14,038
Think about it for a moment
and you will realize..

1388
01:33:14,144 --> 01:33:16,112
..how wrong you are in thinking so.

1389
01:33:16,347 --> 01:33:19,783
l might me wrong. l
might not get Balaji.

1390
01:33:20,351 --> 01:33:22,046
But l won't love a fraud like you..

1391
01:33:22,152 --> 01:33:24,120
..who plays such games with people.

1392
01:33:26,490 --> 01:33:28,048
Stop there. Don't say just
anything and everything.

1393
01:33:28,158 --> 01:33:30,456
Not just you, but even
l have a mouth.

1394
01:33:30,694 --> 01:33:32,662
l am not a fool to marry
a mad girl like you.

1395
01:33:32,763 --> 01:33:34,663
Buddy. - Stay out of this.
Go and chase Balaji.

1396
01:33:34,832 --> 01:33:36,527
You will see what will happen
to you at the end of the day.

1397
01:33:36,834 --> 01:33:40,395
lt's my fault to talk to you.
- Then what are you waiting for?

1398
01:33:40,638 --> 01:33:41,662
Get lost.

1399
01:33:49,847 --> 01:33:52,077
Don't talk rubbish. You talk
as if you are the only one..

1400
01:33:52,182 --> 01:33:55,549
..to know about love and you are
the only lover in this world.

1401
01:33:55,719 --> 01:33:57,084
lf we try to find a match for you..

1402
01:33:57,187 --> 01:33:59,348
..we won't even get a girl
who's seventh pass.

1403
01:33:59,657 --> 01:34:01,090
So you ask me to go
to that med girl..

1404
01:34:01,191 --> 01:34:03,625
..and beg her to love me.
All the times she is like..

1405
01:34:03,794 --> 01:34:06,820
Aravind, you know Balaji is a
nice guy. Such a sweet guy.

1406
01:34:07,197 --> 01:34:09,290
Such a great guy. My
heart starts burning.

1407
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:13,366
O God! When she talks about
him she's floating in air.

1408
01:34:13,604 --> 01:34:16,095
From this moment onwards there
is no love, no Dhana..

1409
01:34:16,206 --> 01:34:17,833
..and no Balaji at all.

1410
01:34:19,410 --> 01:34:21,173
Mother, l am going to Kolkata.

1411
01:34:21,545 --> 01:34:24,514
Bless me that l return like
the top industrialist Ambani.

1412
01:34:25,416 --> 01:34:28,385
May you get Dhana Lakshmi
very soon ! - Mom.

1413
01:34:28,552 --> 01:34:32,147
Hey, listen to me. Dhana Lakshmi
is a very beautiful girl.

1414
01:34:32,289 --> 01:34:35,122
Mother, if you wish l will bring
a more beautiful girl..

1415
01:34:35,225 --> 01:34:38,126
..from Kolkata. - Get lost. l
don't want a more beautiful..

1416
01:34:38,228 --> 01:34:41,664
..daughter-in-law. l want
Dhana Lakshmi, that's all.

1417
01:34:41,832 --> 01:34:45,324
Father.
- What? - They are asking me to..

1418
01:34:45,436 --> 01:34:46,460
Shut up!

1419
01:34:48,706 --> 01:34:51,675
What's going on there!
- Go to hell. Let's go.

1420
01:34:53,243 --> 01:34:54,267
Go to hell.

1421
01:34:58,382 --> 01:34:59,872
Dear Dhana Lakshmi.

1422
01:35:00,918 --> 01:35:02,886
Grandpa Subbaiah, it's you?

1423
01:35:03,253 --> 01:35:05,278
When did you come? How are you?
- l'm fine.

1424
01:35:05,456 --> 01:35:06,684
How are you, girl?
- Fine.

1425
01:35:06,924 --> 01:35:09,154
l heard that your aunt came
and created a scene here.

1426
01:35:11,261 --> 01:35:13,161
Nitu. - l know everything.
You didn't even ask him..

1427
01:35:13,263 --> 01:35:15,424
..to come inside.
- lt's alright, girl.

1428
01:35:15,599 --> 01:35:17,157
l need to tell you something
very important. That's why..

1429
01:35:17,267 --> 01:35:18,564
..l came here without telling
anyone back home.

1430
01:35:18,736 --> 01:35:20,567
We received a letter
for you last week.

1431
01:35:21,271 --> 01:35:23,171
With the fear that she might
read your letter..

1432
01:35:23,273 --> 01:35:25,173
..l didn't tell her about it. Since
we don't get too many letters..

1433
01:35:25,275 --> 01:35:27,175
..addressed to your name
l came to give to you..

1434
01:35:27,277 --> 01:35:28,904
..as l thought it might
be very important.

1435
01:35:30,481 --> 01:35:34,918
'Hi, Dhana. lt's me, Balaji.'
- Dhana Lakshmi.

1436
01:35:38,822 --> 01:35:41,791
'l miss you everyday. These
days l miss you even more.'

1437
01:35:42,426 --> 01:35:43,450
'That's why l am writing
you this letter.'

1438
01:35:44,361 --> 01:35:47,387
'l completed my studies. After
gradual progress in business..'

1439
01:35:47,698 --> 01:35:49,393
'..l am earning good money now.'

1440
01:35:49,900 --> 01:35:53,336
'Whenever l think of our childhood
l get teary-eyed.'

1441
01:35:54,838 --> 01:35:58,672
'When l think of you now my heart
flies like a butterfly.'

1442
01:35:59,643 --> 01:36:01,338
'l think this is what
is called love.'

1443
01:36:02,312 --> 01:36:05,748
'lf you too have such a feeling
for me will you meet me once?'

1444
01:36:08,852 --> 01:36:12,219
Was that Balaji? - Didn't l
tell you that l will meet..

1445
01:36:12,322 --> 01:36:16,952
..Balaji sooner or later?
Thanks, grandpa.

1446
01:36:17,327 --> 01:36:18,954
You got lord's blessings, girl.

1447
01:36:19,396 --> 01:36:22,490
You will reach your beloved
one. Goodbye, girl.

1448
01:36:22,666 --> 01:36:24,224
You will leave so soon?
- l lied to your aunt..

1449
01:36:24,334 --> 01:36:26,564
..that l am going
to my native place.

1450
01:36:26,804 --> 01:36:29,830
That demon shouldn't know
that l came here. Goodbye.

1451
01:36:30,340 --> 01:36:32,706
Take care of Dhana Lakshmi.
- Ok, grandpa.

1452
01:36:45,823 --> 01:36:49,657
'She came here as well? l will
get mad if l sit next to her.'

1453
01:36:51,428 --> 01:36:53,658
Excuse me, sir. My
berth number is 34.

1454
01:36:53,764 --> 01:36:55,789
Facing problem. As per Vastu
l can't sit there.

1455
01:36:56,500 --> 01:36:57,524
What will happen if you sit there?

1456
01:36:57,701 --> 01:36:58,998
Nothing will happen to me, but
the train will be in trouble.

1457
01:37:03,507 --> 01:37:04,531
Did you laugh?

1458
01:37:07,377 --> 01:37:08,537
Give it to me.

1459
01:37:12,916 --> 01:37:14,884
Sir, l need to go
to toilet urgently.

1460
01:37:15,385 --> 01:37:16,409
Keep an eye on my bag.

1461
01:37:19,723 --> 01:37:21,691
No, just keep an eye on my seat.

1462
01:37:22,926 --> 01:37:24,757
Don't finish it. Leave some
for later. - l know.

1463
01:37:30,734 --> 01:37:33,567
Sir, there's some disturbance
over there.

1464
01:37:34,338 --> 01:37:35,566
Will l get another berth?

1465
01:37:37,808 --> 01:37:39,036
They have no common sense at all.

1466
01:37:39,943 --> 01:37:41,706
l think my time's not good today.

1467
01:37:45,415 --> 01:37:47,315
'What's this now! She's appearing
wherever l go..'

1468
01:37:47,417 --> 01:37:48,714
'..like the moon in the sky.'

1469
01:37:49,620 --> 01:37:52,589
What's this! He is following
me like the monkey's tail.

1470
01:37:52,890 --> 01:37:56,849
Uncle, you tell who sat here first.
- Who are you?

1471
01:38:06,970 --> 01:38:10,371
Excuse me! l too gave an order.
- lt's not written here.

1472
01:38:11,041 --> 01:38:12,531
Ok.

1473
01:39:13,437 --> 01:39:14,461
Dhana.

1474
01:39:15,505 --> 01:39:16,529
Take it.

1475
01:39:17,641 --> 01:39:20,542
No, thanks.
- You look very hungry. Take it.

1476
01:39:20,644 --> 01:39:21,668
Did l ask for it?

1477
01:39:43,467 --> 01:39:47,028
What happened? Tell me fast.
The train stopped here.

1478
01:39:47,137 --> 01:39:48,161
Sir, do we get any eatables here?

1479
01:39:48,472 --> 01:39:49,564
No, you don't get anything
here, girl.

1480
01:39:49,940 --> 01:39:52,841
Check what the problem is
and send a message, ok?

1481
01:40:11,561 --> 01:40:12,585
Excuse me!

1482
01:40:15,899 --> 01:40:16,923
Take it.

1483
01:40:17,768 --> 01:40:18,792
Take it.

1484
01:40:20,771 --> 01:40:21,795
O God!

1485
01:40:45,996 --> 01:40:47,896
Hey, stop!

1486
01:40:49,866 --> 01:40:50,890
Stop!

1487
01:41:12,289 --> 01:41:14,917
''A slim, beautiful girl is here..''

1488
01:41:15,959 --> 01:41:18,257
''..with a smile on her face.''

1489
01:41:18,895 --> 01:41:21,557
''A slim, beautiful girl..''

1490
01:41:25,836 --> 01:41:30,136
Hey, who pushed me? ''A slim,
beautiful girl..''

1491
01:41:57,200 --> 01:41:58,224
Why are you following me?

1492
01:42:00,871 --> 01:42:02,634
You won't follow me if you
have even a bit of shame.

1493
01:42:05,142 --> 01:42:06,575
l brought the biscuit packet for
you with so much difficulty..

1494
01:42:06,676 --> 01:42:09,042
..and you rejected it. l am
so angry right now that..

1495
01:42:09,279 --> 01:42:10,303
Carry this as well.

1496
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:26,058
Hello! Hello! Where?

1497
01:42:35,705 --> 01:42:37,332
He has got the dog and l got you.

1498
01:42:42,779 --> 01:42:43,871
Get lost, rascal.

1499
01:42:44,915 --> 01:42:49,011
You get angry? You don't?
That's better.

1500
01:42:50,253 --> 01:42:51,345
Follow me.

1501
01:42:53,924 --> 01:42:56,222
Still how far?
- Till Kolkata.

1502
01:42:56,726 --> 01:42:59,217
You got down at a great station.
No train stops here.

1503
01:43:09,005 --> 01:43:11,030
Dear, take 50 from them.

1504
01:43:12,809 --> 01:43:16,040
Saroja, give two Biryanis here.
- Yes, coming.

1505
01:43:19,816 --> 01:43:22,910
Dear, take 100 from them.
- Ok.

1506
01:43:23,286 --> 01:43:26,653
Your wife will take money
when there is no mutton..

1507
01:43:26,756 --> 01:43:30,192
..in the Biryani? What
do you sell here?

1508
01:43:30,293 --> 01:43:33,262
Sir, no fights here.
- No fights?

1509
01:43:33,763 --> 01:43:36,391
You know who l am? l am the
big brother of this area.

1510
01:43:36,700 --> 01:43:37,928
You dared to ask money from me?

1511
01:43:38,168 --> 01:43:40,068
You want money? You want money?

1512
01:43:41,104 --> 01:43:44,938
Saroja, no. No.

1513
01:43:45,308 --> 01:43:50,075
You are saying 'no' to her.
- Sir, no.

1514
01:43:50,780 --> 01:43:54,079
Please no fights here.
- No fights here?

1515
01:43:57,921 --> 01:44:02,688
Saroja, no. - Make her touch
my feet and apologize to me..

1516
01:44:02,792 --> 01:44:07,422
..and then send her with me,
or else l will kill you.

1517
01:44:08,198 --> 01:44:12,430
What did you say! Scoundrel..

1518
01:44:13,803 --> 01:44:17,239
Sir, didn't l tell you?
Did l warn you?

1519
01:44:17,874 --> 01:44:19,034
But you didn't listen to me.

1520
01:44:22,879 --> 01:44:30,183
Saroja, no.. Saroja, no..

1521
01:44:31,821 --> 01:44:34,449
When he was saying 'no,
Saroja' l didn't get it.

1522
01:44:34,958 --> 01:44:35,982
So this is it for?

1523
01:44:50,974 --> 01:44:51,998
You are not a human being.

1524
01:44:52,375 --> 01:44:54,343
My blood starts boiling
when l see you.

1525
01:44:54,511 --> 01:44:55,739
l am not coming back for
love or anything..

1526
01:44:55,845 --> 01:44:58,143
..but l am coming back to save
my father's reputation.

1527
01:44:59,115 --> 01:45:02,482
Rajamma, l am driving the car
here. What's that noise!

1528
01:45:03,186 --> 01:45:06,747
l am making noise? But
when my sister talks..

1529
01:45:06,856 --> 01:45:08,824
..you hear with a wide grin, rascal.

1530
01:45:09,125 --> 01:45:10,752
Rajamma, l told you thousand times..

1531
01:45:10,860 --> 01:45:14,887
..not to hit me when l am driving.
lt's a very bad habit.

1532
01:45:21,871 --> 01:45:24,169
Sir, we missed the train. Will
you please give us lift?

1533
01:45:24,407 --> 01:45:26,307
Not possible.
- Possible. - Possible.

1534
01:45:27,477 --> 01:45:28,501
Thank you, madam.

1535
01:45:37,320 --> 01:45:39,447
Madam looks just like Eliyana,
doesn't she?

1536
01:45:43,126 --> 01:45:45,924
Yes, she is Eliyana
and l am Mahesh Babu.

1537
01:45:46,830 --> 01:45:48,855
Both of us are going to
Kashmir to sing a duet.

1538
01:45:49,899 --> 01:45:50,991
Shouldn't l be cracking jokes?

1539
01:45:51,101 --> 01:45:52,864
Earlier you used to ask
me to crack jokes.

1540
01:46:09,519 --> 01:46:11,214
l gave you lift and you
put me in trouble?

1541
01:46:12,589 --> 01:46:15,057
Sir, fights are common between
husband and wife.

1542
01:46:15,158 --> 01:46:18,184
Sir, l will give you a formula.
lf you follow that formula..

1543
01:46:18,295 --> 01:46:21,162
..that love will come
back into your lives.

1544
01:46:21,598 --> 01:46:23,828
What's that formula?
- That is called the one and only..

1545
01:46:23,933 --> 01:46:27,835
..the great flashback phobia
treatment. - That means?

1546
01:46:28,071 --> 01:46:30,835
Whenever there is a problem
between you two..

1547
01:46:30,940 --> 01:46:32,965
..think about some beautiful
memory of the past..

1548
01:46:33,076 --> 01:46:35,271
..and rewind it and play it again.
- lf we do so?

1549
01:46:35,378 --> 01:46:38,438
Then those beautiful moments
of the past will be back.

1550
01:46:39,416 --> 01:46:40,440
lt's ok with me.

1551
01:46:41,284 --> 01:46:42,308
lt's ok with me too.

1552
01:46:43,386 --> 01:46:45,115
Where were we five years back?

1553
01:46:46,623 --> 01:46:48,853
Kodaikanal. - At that time
you were looking at me..

1554
01:46:48,958 --> 01:46:51,984
..in the restaurant with lustful
eyes and bit my father's hand..

1555
01:46:52,095 --> 01:46:54,120
..assuming it to be a sandwich.

1556
01:46:57,133 --> 01:46:59,863
That was at afternoon.
- That evening you were coming..

1557
01:46:59,969 --> 01:47:02,995
..along the path across the
pond and l winked at you..

1558
01:47:03,106 --> 01:47:06,132
..and you got a jerk and
bumped into an old lady..

1559
01:47:06,242 --> 01:47:09,006
..going on the road and fell down.
- That was at evening.

1560
01:47:09,379 --> 01:47:14,476
And at night? - O come on !
You are making me blush.

1561
01:47:14,584 --> 01:47:16,950
Shall l narrate that incident?

1562
01:47:18,254 --> 01:47:20,882
That night it was very cold
and l was waiting for you..

1563
01:47:20,990 --> 01:47:24,289
..in our room with
fire of separation.

1564
01:47:25,195 --> 01:47:28,426
And the electricity goes off.
- Yes, l too remember it.

1565
01:47:30,133 --> 01:47:32,897
At that time you open the
door and come inside..

1566
01:47:33,002 --> 01:47:35,562
..with the fragrance
of jasmine flowers.

1567
01:47:37,273 --> 01:47:40,242
You looked like goddess
in that moonlight.

1568
01:47:41,945 --> 01:47:46,382
And then unable to resist
myself l.. - Hey!

1569
01:47:48,051 --> 01:47:50,451
That night l went to
bed at 7 O' clock.

1570
01:47:51,488 --> 01:47:54,514
lt was my sister who brought
milk for you then.

1571
01:47:56,292 --> 01:47:57,316
Oh God!

1572
01:48:00,697 --> 01:48:03,063
Scoundrel, l will not
come back to you again.

1573
01:48:03,233 --> 01:48:06,225
Rajamma. Rajamma. Rajamma,
don't leave.

1574
01:48:06,336 --> 01:48:09,100
Stop it. - Rajamma, it's a lorry.
Don't get into that.

1575
01:48:09,205 --> 01:48:11,139
Please, Rajamma.

1576
01:48:11,441 --> 01:48:14,410
Rajamma. Rajamma.

1577
01:48:15,278 --> 01:48:16,677
Rajyam.

1578
01:48:22,252 --> 01:48:26,348
l will be indebted to
the advice you gave me.

1579
01:48:26,723 --> 01:48:29,248
Will you do me a small favor?

1580
01:48:29,426 --> 01:48:30,450
What, sir?

1581
01:48:30,560 --> 01:48:34,690
l don't have energy to do that.
There is a gun in my car.

1582
01:48:35,131 --> 01:48:36,689
Will you bring it for me?
- What for, sir?

1583
01:48:37,200 --> 01:48:40,101
So that l could shoot you.
So that l could shoot you.

1584
01:48:40,203 --> 01:48:41,261
Hey, l will shoot..

1585
01:48:43,940 --> 01:48:45,965
You fool!

1586
01:48:47,343 --> 01:48:50,039
You could've stayed silent there.

1587
01:48:50,146 --> 01:48:52,171
l didn't know that he would
give such a twist.

1588
01:48:53,850 --> 01:48:56,648
ldea. - What? - Look there,
it's a guesthouse.

1589
01:48:56,753 --> 01:48:58,687
Sir is about to take rest there.
- l won't come.

1590
01:48:58,788 --> 01:49:01,313
But who called you? You
go on some lorry. Bye.

1591
01:49:08,298 --> 01:49:09,322
You are doing this only with
pride that l will have to..

1592
01:49:09,432 --> 01:49:10,865
..to follow you no matter
whatever you do, right?

1593
01:49:12,368 --> 01:49:13,392
Ya.

1594
01:49:19,042 --> 01:49:21,010
No, no, no. Follow me.

1595
01:49:22,846 --> 01:49:24,939
Madam. Sir.

1596
01:49:26,282 --> 01:49:27,306
Madam.

1597
01:49:28,451 --> 01:49:31,147
Am l the only one who should
call out? You too call them.

1598
01:49:34,057 --> 01:49:35,081
Madam.

1599
01:49:36,826 --> 01:49:37,850
Sir.

1600
01:49:38,161 --> 01:49:40,288
Madam.
- Who are you? What do you want?

1601
01:49:40,730 --> 01:49:43,028
We are coming from Hyderabad.
Our car broke down.

1602
01:49:43,199 --> 01:49:46,032
We want to sleep here tonight.
We'll leave tomorrow morning.

1603
01:49:46,236 --> 01:49:48,898
l see. Come in. Come in.

1604
01:49:49,339 --> 01:49:50,363
Thank you.

1605
01:49:50,740 --> 01:49:53,766
So you know Oriya as well?
- Not just Oriya..

1606
01:49:53,877 --> 01:49:57,904
..but l know Hindi, Punjabi,
Gujarati, Tamil, Tulu..

1607
01:49:58,014 --> 01:50:03,111
..German, Chinese, Japanese and
girl, l know Telugu as well.

1608
01:50:03,353 --> 01:50:05,321
But you can't repair a Luna though.

1609
01:50:08,391 --> 01:50:12,794
l need to change the dress.
You wait here. - Evil girl.

1610
01:50:15,198 --> 01:50:18,793
Madam. Madam.
- What? - l will sleep here.

1611
01:50:19,102 --> 01:50:21,798
Ask him to sleep outside.
Please. Please.

1612
01:50:21,971 --> 01:50:25,998
What are you saying?
- He is mad. Mad.

1613
01:50:30,380 --> 01:50:31,404
Yes.

1614
01:50:33,816 --> 01:50:35,340
Son.
- Can l go inside, madam?

1615
01:50:35,785 --> 01:50:38,219
You sleep outside and that
girl will sleep inside.

1616
01:50:38,388 --> 01:50:40,913
lt's so cold outside.
- You have to sleep outside.

1617
01:50:41,024 --> 01:50:43,424
Have mercy upon me.
- Don't irritate me. Go away.

1618
01:50:43,793 --> 01:50:45,488
Madam, please.
- Go away.

1619
01:50:46,329 --> 01:50:47,819
Madam. Madam, please.

1620
01:50:54,137 --> 01:50:59,302
Boy, it's very cold
out there. Take care.

1621
01:51:03,813 --> 01:51:05,440
So it's your deed? l'll tell you.

1622
01:51:07,283 --> 01:51:09,012
l can sleep happily now.

1623
01:51:11,220 --> 01:51:13,017
Who are you? Why are
you sleeping here?

1624
01:51:13,823 --> 01:51:15,450
We missed out train. So we are..

1625
01:51:16,192 --> 01:51:18,956
You are Telugu? And why are you
standing next to this house?

1626
01:51:20,363 --> 01:51:21,796
Why, sir? - A lady who used
to live in this hut..

1627
01:51:21,898 --> 01:51:24,298
..committed suicide two years ago.

1628
01:51:24,400 --> 01:51:25,924
They say her spirit

1629
01:51:26,369 --> 01:51:29,861
What! What are you saying?
- Yes, son.

1630
01:51:29,973 --> 01:51:31,998
A few days ago a couple
stayed at night..

1631
01:51:32,108 --> 01:51:33,803
..and died the very next day
due to blood vomiting.

1632
01:51:34,544 --> 01:51:36,205
Only those who sleep inside
will face the problem, right?

1633
01:51:36,312 --> 01:51:39,281
lt won't affect us, sir.
- l told you what l needed to say.

1634
01:51:39,449 --> 01:51:40,473
Now it's up to you.

1635
01:51:55,431 --> 01:51:59,834
Aravind, whom were you
talking to till now?

1636
01:52:00,336 --> 01:52:02,497
Some idiot. Don't disturb me.

1637
01:52:02,872 --> 01:52:05,898
ls that old lady really a spirit?
- Hey, don't believe it..

1638
01:52:06,009 --> 01:52:07,169
..just because someone
says something.

1639
01:52:07,477 --> 01:52:09,342
Don't irritate me by talking
about ghosts and spirits?

1640
01:52:09,879 --> 01:52:11,574
Go to bed. We need to wake
up early in the morning.

1641
01:52:12,615 --> 01:52:15,846
lt's very cold out here. Why don't
you come inside to sleep?

1642
01:52:18,254 --> 01:52:21,314
Go away.
- Aravind, please come inside.

1643
01:52:22,458 --> 01:52:24,858
l am feeling scared. Please.

1644
01:52:26,396 --> 01:52:27,988
Please.
- Ok.

1645
01:52:35,304 --> 01:52:36,328
Alright.

1646
01:53:14,610 --> 01:53:15,634
Aravind..

1647
01:53:16,179 --> 01:53:20,047
What! - That old lady.. No,
she has become a ghost.

1648
01:53:20,516 --> 01:53:21,540
Sleep quietly.

1649
01:53:28,357 --> 01:53:32,316
''A thunderbolt reached the heart.''

1650
01:53:32,962 --> 01:53:36,989
''A lightening entered the heart.''

1651
01:53:37,300 --> 01:53:42,397
''My girl's touch set me ablaze.''

1652
01:53:52,982 --> 01:53:57,146
''My heart is set on
fire every now and then.''

1653
01:53:57,253 --> 01:53:59,414
''You are the one who is
setting me on fire.''

1654
01:54:01,691 --> 01:54:05,684
''My age is restless age.''

1655
01:54:06,329 --> 01:54:10,231
''And you're the reason behind
my restlessness.''

1656
01:54:28,451 --> 01:54:32,979
''My heart is set on fire
every now and then.''

1657
01:54:33,089 --> 01:54:36,388
''You are the one who is
setting me on fire.''

1658
01:55:21,771 --> 01:55:26,231
''Your hug is most previous
thing for me.''

1659
01:55:26,342 --> 01:55:30,574
''l am desperate for you.
- When did l say no.''

1660
01:55:30,680 --> 01:55:35,174
''You are my final destination.''

1661
01:55:35,284 --> 01:55:39,448
''When l reach you..
- l spread my hand for you.''

1662
01:55:39,822 --> 01:55:41,722
''Your lips and my lips..''

1663
01:55:41,824 --> 01:55:44,054
''When they unite..''

1664
01:55:44,427 --> 01:55:46,657
''l am looking for such a chance.''

1665
01:55:48,831 --> 01:55:50,731
''Don't waste any further time.''

1666
01:55:51,234 --> 01:55:54,726
''Come to me, baby.''

1667
01:56:56,899 --> 01:57:01,131
''Your touch gives me
the greatest joy.''

1668
01:57:01,237 --> 01:57:05,731
''l get great joy is
chasing your shadow.''

1669
01:57:10,579 --> 01:57:12,410
''The separate bodies..''

1670
01:57:12,515 --> 01:57:14,540
''..burning with desires..''

1671
01:57:15,184 --> 01:57:17,345
''..will unite today.''

1672
01:57:19,522 --> 01:57:21,547
''Whatever hurdle we face..''

1673
01:57:21,657 --> 01:57:23,625
''..we won't separate..''

1674
01:57:23,726 --> 01:57:25,694
''..at any cost today.''

Aravind.

1728
02:03:43,238 --> 02:03:45,263
Check the BP frequently.
- Ok, sir. - Doctor.

1729

There's no need to worry, girl.
He lost some blood.

1730
02:03:47,843 --> 02:03:49,868
He needs some rest. Make
sure that he doesn't..

Yes, you are disturbing me a lot.

1736
02:04:20,943 --> 02:04:23,571
What if l hadn't seen
you losing conscious..

1737
02:04:23,679 --> 02:04:25,704
..and something would've
happened to you?

1738
02:04:25,948 --> 02:04:27,973
Nothing would happen to
me. You don't worry.

1739
02:04:32,788 --> 02:04:35,757
Ok, give me your home number.
l'll inform your parents.

1740
02:04:35,858 --> 02:04:37,883
No, no. - Why? - My mother
cries for two days..

1741
02:04:37,993 --> 02:04:40,120
..even when someone dies
in her TV serials.

1742
02:04:40,295 --> 02:04:43,924
lf she knows about this she
would.. l will manage it.

1743
02:04:47,636 --> 02:04:50,662
Why are you so upset? Did
doctor say that my life..

1744
02:04:50,773 --> 02:04:52,866
..is in danger?
- No, he didn't say that.

1745
02:04:53,041 --> 02:04:55,601
Tell me how many hours l have
now. Did they tell you..

1746
02:04:55,711 --> 02:04:58,202
..that even doctors from
abroad can't save me?

1747
02:04:58,380 --> 02:05:02,009
l don't fear death, but l have
a small wish before dying.

1748
02:05:03,051 --> 02:05:05,815
What's that? - l want to be
photographed in this dress.

1749
02:05:08,056 --> 02:05:10,889
Aravind, are you mad or what!
You joke even at this time?

1750
02:05:13,662 --> 02:05:18,156
Mental.
- Saroja, no. No, Saroja. No.

1751
02:05:18,267 --> 02:05:22,169
No, Saroja. Saroja,..

02:05:22,271 --> 02:05:24,831
Saroja. No, Saroja. Laugh.
Laugh. Laugh.

1753
02:05:28,410 --> 02:05:31,038
What are you saying, uncle,
Aravind left to Kolkata?

1754
02:05:31,180 --> 02:05:32,204
Then why didn't he reach here yet?

1755
02:05:32,748 --> 02:05:35,740
Alright, you don't worry. He is
not a kid. He will come here.

1756
02:05:37,753 --> 02:05:40,221
Hey, pack everything properly.

1757
02:06:12,321 --> 02:06:13,345
Sir, you are..

02:06:16,124 --> 02:06:19,150
You.. You didn't recognize me?

l am busy in my business from
software to real estate..

1760
02:06:22,798 --> 02:06:25,699
..to import to export,
but that doesn't mean..

1761
02:06:25,801 --> 02:06:29,897
..you would forget me.
- l forgot you?

1762
02:06:30,873 --> 02:06:36,038
Ok. Ok. Ok. My monthly
turnover is 100 crore.

1763
02:06:37,145 --> 02:06:39,136
That doesn't mean you
will not recognize me.

1764
02:06:39,848 --> 02:06:42,874
l didn't recognize you? Sir.
- Sir. Sir. Sir. Sir.

1765

l came to buy Howrah Bridge
in Kolkata. ls it my fault?

1766
02:06:46,054 --> 02:06:49,455
That doesn't mean you will call
your childhood friend 'sir'.

1767
02:06:49,758 --> 02:06:52,318
'My childhood friend?
Business in crores?'

1768
02:06:52,461 --> 02:06:53,985
'lt seems he might kill me
if l do not recognize him.'

1769
02:06:54,363 --> 02:06:57,730
Hey, it's you? How are you?

1770
02:06:57,833 --> 02:06:59,824
Leave that aside. What
are you doing here?

1771
02:06:59,935 --> 02:07:01,926

You carry on.

02:10:48,330 --> 02:10:52,096
Sorry, Aravind. l was about

1836
02:10:56,071 --> 02:10:59,131
Hello! Balaji, please..

Ok, then..

1845

What happened, madam?
- What shall l say, son !

1846
02:12:14,482 --> 02:12:17,042

02:12:28,163 --> 02:12:29,687
Dhana Lakshmi.

1850
02:12:35,670 --> 02:12:38,230
Dhana Lakshmi. Dhana Lakshmi.

1851
02:12:38,607 --> 02:12:42,543
Dhana Lakshmi, open the
doors. Dhana Lakshmi.

1852
02:12:44,446 --> 02:12:45,538
Open the doors.

1853
02:12:46,214 --> 02:12:47,374
Aravind.
- Dhana..

1854
02:12:52,587 --> 02:12:54,077
Here's Dhana Lakshmi.
Didn't you tell him..

1855
02:12:54,189 --> 02:12:56,089
..that you didn't leave.
We already have..

1856
02:12:56,191 --> 02:12:58,386
..a number of tensions here.
You come with me.

1857
02:13:00,662 --> 02:13:04,098
Aravind, what's all this!
- l can bear it if you leave me..

1858
02:13:04,199 --> 02:13:07,828
..but if l leave this earth..

1859
02:13:28,256 --> 02:13:29,621
l won't send you alone now.

1860
02:13:30,158 --> 02:13:31,523
l will personally
take you to Balaji.

1861
02:13:31,626 --> 02:13:39,533
''Why did you forget sleeping
after you saw me?''

1862
02:13:39,668 --> 02:13:47,598
''Why did you ask for my heart
that is not with me anymore?''

1863
02:13:47,842 --> 02:13:55,339
''You crossed my path at once..''

1864
02:15:20,835 --> 02:15:22,393
Wait a minute. l will check it.

1865
02:15:24,472 --> 02:15:26,303
Who do you want?
- We came for Mr. Balaji.

1866
02:15:26,408 --> 02:15:27,966
Ya. Ya. Ok. Sure.

1867
02:15:31,012 --> 02:15:33,572
Dhana Lakshmi.

1868
02:15:36,017 --> 02:15:37,712
Dhana Lakshmi.

1869
02:15:40,321 --> 02:15:41,913
Dhana Lakshmi.

1870
02:15:47,562 --> 02:15:49,325
Dhana Lakshmi.

1871
02:16:08,316 --> 02:16:10,876
Leave me, Balaji.
- Hey, Dhana, it's me.

1872
02:16:10,985 --> 02:16:12,714
What are you staring at!
lt's me, your Balaji.

1873
02:16:12,821 --> 02:16:14,288
You didn't recognize me? l

1874
02:16:14,389 --> 02:16:15,686
..since so long, you know..
l am happy today.

1875
02:16:15,790 --> 02:16:18,691
l am very, very happy today.
Yes, yes, l got you.

1876
02:16:24,065 --> 02:16:27,364
Hey, Dhana. Dhana Lakshmi, you..

1877
02:16:27,469 --> 02:16:29,835
Aravind. Aravind.

1878
02:16:33,007 --> 02:16:38,912
''My love..''

1879
02:16:39,347 --> 02:16:41,577
''My love..''

1880
02:16:41,683 --> 02:16:46,848
''My love..''

1881
02:16:47,355 --> 02:16:49,585
''My love..''

1882
02:16:49,691 --> 02:16:56,859
''My heart yearns only for you.''

1883
02:16:57,665 --> 02:17:04,537
''You are my life.''

1884
02:17:25,593 --> 02:17:26,617
Aravind.

1885
02:17:30,131 --> 02:17:32,759
Miss, someone came for you.

1886
02:17:37,138 --> 02:17:39,402
Grandpa.
- l am sorry, girl.

1887
02:17:40,408 --> 02:17:42,376
Your aunt came to know
that l met you..

1888
02:17:42,477 --> 02:17:43,774
..and gave you that letter.

1889
02:17:45,413 --> 02:17:48,382
She sent men to search
you all over Kolkata..

1890
02:17:48,483 --> 02:17:50,383
..and finally found out
that you are here.

1891
02:17:50,485 --> 02:17:52,817
She came here with
all the relatives.

1892
02:17:55,924 --> 02:17:58,984
What's this, Dhana! Ours is
a well-respected family.

1893
02:17:59,093 --> 02:18:01,459
Doing such a thing is not right
on your part. Let's go, girl.

1894
02:18:01,629 --> 02:18:03,859
Excuse me! Who are you all?

1895
02:18:03,965 --> 02:18:06,832
We all are Dhana Lakshmi's
relatives. - Hello, greetings!

1896
02:18:06,935 --> 02:18:10,393
So you are that Balaji? So
you are the one for whom..

1897
02:18:10,505 --> 02:18:13,804
..she left such a nice match?
- Look, son.

1898
02:18:13,975 --> 02:18:17,433
Our girl staying in your house
doesn't look that good.

1899
02:18:17,612 --> 02:18:20,911
We love each other. We are about
to get married as well.

1900
02:18:23,818 --> 02:18:26,412
What makes you think that
l will get my daughter..

1901
02:18:26,521 --> 02:18:29,752
..married to a worthless fellow
like you? - That was then.

1902
02:18:30,124 --> 02:18:31,921
You know what is my son's
property worth right now?

1903
02:18:32,026 --> 02:18:34,426
150 crores.
- l don't want even a broke shell..

1904
02:18:34,529 --> 02:18:36,997
..from your property.

1905
02:18:38,199 --> 02:18:41,100
l will keep Dhana in my heart and
look after her like a queen.

1906
02:18:43,771 --> 02:18:45,432
What objection do
you have now, girl?

1907
02:18:45,540 --> 02:18:48,441
No, she's a girl. l feared
that she might get fooled..

1908
02:18:48,543 --> 02:18:52,172
..in the name of love. That's
why l tried to stop her.

1909
02:18:52,914 --> 02:18:55,439
What objection would l
have if my daughter..

1910
02:18:55,550 --> 02:18:58,041
..gets a match from
such a big family?

1911
02:19:00,088 --> 02:19:02,454
God is there on your side.
That's why you got..

1912
02:19:02,557 --> 02:19:04,457
..such a nice man as your husband.

1913
02:19:04,559 --> 02:19:06,459
Look, she shouldn't have the grief..

1914
02:19:06,561 --> 02:19:08,791
..that she is getting married
in her family's absence.

1915
02:19:09,230 --> 02:19:10,458
You stay here during our wedding..

1916
02:19:10,565 --> 02:19:12,192
..and give us your blessings.

1917
02:19:14,502 --> 02:19:16,993
Dhana, you are getting
married to Balaji.

1918
02:19:17,105 --> 02:19:20,074
Why are you still so dull?
- She's not dull, brother.

1919
02:19:20,241 --> 02:19:23,472
Actually Dhana is unable to
believe that l agreed..

1920
02:19:23,578 --> 02:19:26,479
..to this match. Look, Dhana,
now even God can't..

1921
02:19:26,581 --> 02:19:30,210
..stop this wedding. What
are you staring at?

1922
02:19:30,518 --> 02:19:33,214
You came here running for this
particular Balaji, right?

1923
02:19:42,864 --> 02:19:44,957
Aravind, this is our
work spot. Get down.

1924
02:19:45,066 --> 02:19:46,590
Hey, get down everything.

1925
02:19:46,701 --> 02:19:47,895
There are three days
left for the wedding.

1926
02:19:48,002 --> 02:19:49,970
Everything must be done at
a fast pace. - One minute.

1927
02:19:50,071 --> 02:19:52,232
l am leaving. l don't want
to work here. - Why?

1928
02:19:52,540 --> 02:19:53,973
l don't want to work here. l want
to leave. Tell my cousin.

1929
02:19:54,075 --> 02:19:56,168
Ok, once the lorry is unloaded
you can go back..

1930
02:19:56,277 --> 02:19:57,608
..on this lorry itself.
- Ok.

1931
02:20:06,988 --> 02:20:10,185
Aravind, why are you killing
me in this way?

1932
02:20:10,558 --> 02:20:12,048
l came here without knowing
this is your house.

1933
02:20:12,160 --> 02:20:17,257
l am sorry, Dhana.
- lt was Aravind for real.

1934
02:20:21,002 --> 02:20:24,130
Where?
- Aravind. - Aravind?

1935
02:20:25,573 --> 02:20:27,666
Hello, Aravind! Wait a minute.

1936
02:20:33,114 --> 02:20:34,945
Hi, Aravind! l am Balaji.

1937
02:20:35,583 --> 02:20:37,608
After bringing my heart from
Hyderabad to Kolkata..

1938
02:20:37,719 --> 02:20:39,983
..you are leaving
without meeting me?

1939
02:20:40,088 --> 02:20:41,112
That's not the thing.

1940
02:20:47,195 --> 02:20:49,789
Why did you leave without
even telling me once?

1941
02:20:51,999 --> 02:20:54,297
Ok, anyhow, you came
here on right time.

1942
02:20:54,602 --> 02:20:56,900
l am giving a treat to my fiancE.
You must also come.

1943
02:20:57,004 --> 02:20:59,302
Sorry. l came here for your
wedding arrangements.

1944
02:20:59,607 --> 02:21:02,235
l have got a lot of work.
- No, no. You are coming. That's it.

1945
02:21:04,679 --> 02:21:05,703
Ok.

1946
02:21:14,822 --> 02:21:18,121
Dhana, what do you want?
First choice is yours.

1947
02:21:20,128 --> 02:21:21,595
lf it was Balaji in your place
he would have asked me..

1948
02:21:21,696 --> 02:21:23,596
..what l would have wanted
and then he would've..

1949
02:21:23,698 --> 02:21:25,598
..given the order. - Sir, you
are doing exactly the way..

1950
02:21:25,700 --> 02:21:28,669
..Dhana told me about you.
Dhana is very lucky, sir.

1951
02:21:28,770 --> 02:21:34,333
ls it? Thank you.
- Hello!

1952
02:21:35,109 --> 02:21:38,101
Hi, tell me.. Stay on
line for a second.

1953
02:21:38,212 --> 02:21:40,703
Sir. Sir, bill..

1954
02:21:46,254 --> 02:21:49,712
l am sorry.. - lt's ok. l'm
the one who should say sorry.

1955
02:21:50,091 --> 02:21:52,286
lt's ok, l will..
- Balaji, what are you doing?

1956
02:21:52,393 --> 02:21:54,691
Sorry.. - How can you just leave
when the bill arrives?

1957
02:21:54,929 --> 02:21:57,124
l'm sorry. lt's an urgent call.
- What's so urgent!

1958
02:21:57,231 --> 02:21:59,631
Hey, cool! Why are you blowing
such a small matter..

1959
02:21:59,734 --> 02:22:01,759
..out of proportion?
- lt's not a small matter.

1960
02:22:01,869 --> 02:22:04,303
lt's cheap mentality. Your
pride of being arrogant.

1961
02:22:04,405 --> 02:22:05,633
You can assume whatever you want to.

1962
02:22:05,740 --> 02:22:07,708
Can l ask you something?
- Ask me.

1963
02:22:08,409 --> 02:22:13,676
Leave it. - l know very well what
you will ask, am l right?

1964
02:22:13,948 --> 02:22:16,382
Yes, what's the relation
between you and him?

1965
02:22:16,918 --> 02:22:18,647
l have been watching it,
l couldn't see a smile..

1966
02:22:18,753 --> 02:22:20,653
..on your face since l saw you,
but when you came here..

1967
02:22:20,755 --> 02:22:23,223
..there was a strange
joy in your face.

1968
02:22:23,424 --> 02:22:26,655
That means you are marrying
me only for my wealth?

1969
02:22:26,761 --> 02:22:30,390
Who needs your wealth ! l was
wondering how to say this.

1970
02:22:30,698 --> 02:22:33,326
Now l am telling you.
l love Aravind.

1971
02:22:33,434 --> 02:22:36,403
l love him. l love him.
l love him. Ok!

1972
02:22:40,007 --> 02:22:43,670
Happy birthday to you !
Happy birthday to you !

1973
02:22:43,778 --> 02:22:46,178
Happy birthday to dear..

1974
02:22:46,280 --> 02:22:47,747
No, sir, l will pay the bill.

1975
02:22:47,849 --> 02:22:50,010
Aravind, you are my guest.
- No, sir, l will pay.

1976
02:22:50,117 --> 02:22:51,209
lt's my treat.
- No, sir, please.

1977
02:23:01,128 --> 02:23:04,188
'What am l thinking about?
l am not doing anything wrong.'

1978
02:23:04,999 --> 02:23:06,364
'Balaji is not in my heart anymore.'

1979
02:23:07,335 --> 02:23:11,328
'lt's only Aravind. l will tell
this to Balaji immediately.'

1980
02:23:21,148 --> 02:23:25,050
Hey, so much has happened, but
you didn't tell me anything!

1981
02:23:25,353 --> 02:23:28,914
lt's not that great a thing.
- What!

1982
02:23:30,024 --> 02:23:35,462
l didn't ask for apple or orange.
lt's just a pickle.

1983
02:23:35,830 --> 02:23:38,799
You didn't even give me the pickle.
l will stop the wedding.

1984
02:23:38,900 --> 02:23:40,231
This is not a wedding
in your family.

1985
02:23:40,334 --> 02:23:44,930
But still l have the capacity
to stop this marriage.

1986
02:23:45,039 --> 02:23:48,440
lf l reveal just one secret
this marriage will go bust.

1987
02:23:49,110 --> 02:23:50,805
What rubbish are you talking!
Shut your mouth.

1988
02:23:50,912 --> 02:23:53,745
Look at him, madam. l asked
for mango pickle..

1989
02:23:53,848 --> 02:23:55,816
..and he is talking cheaply about
me in front of everyone.

1990
02:23:56,117 --> 02:23:59,348
lf l reveal just one secret
this wedding will go bust.

1991
02:23:59,453 --> 02:24:01,250
Hey, mind your language
or l will bash you up.

1992
02:24:01,355 --> 02:24:03,414
Who are you anyway!
- What's wrong with you !

1993
02:24:03,991 --> 02:24:05,754
Are you too drunk?
- lf l was too drunk..

1994
02:24:05,860 --> 02:24:08,055
..your secret would've
already been revealed.

1995
02:24:08,396 --> 02:24:12,298
You should respect me for
doing whatever you told me.

1996
02:24:12,867 --> 02:24:14,767
But he insulted me in
front of everyone..

1997
02:24:14,869 --> 02:24:16,769
..and you kept mum watching it.

1998
02:24:16,871 --> 02:24:19,271
lf l reveal one secret this
marriage will be cancelled.

1999
02:24:20,141 --> 02:24:22,507
Hey, you are going too far
as we are silent. - Hey!

2000
02:24:23,311 --> 02:24:25,836
You are raising your hand on me?

2001
02:24:26,380 --> 02:24:29,781
Everyone listen to me. As
you all think the groom..

2002
02:24:29,884 --> 02:24:35,322
..is not the real Balaji.
Yes, that's true.

2003
02:24:35,890 --> 02:24:40,122
He is the duplicate Balaji
who is paid to act here.

2004
02:24:42,430 --> 02:24:45,797
For the money she offered
me l lied to Dhana..

2005
02:24:45,900 --> 02:24:49,097
..that Balaji wrote her a letter.

2006
02:24:51,439 --> 02:24:55,876
Team DG

2007
02:24:55,977 --> 02:24:57,467
They are all fake people.

2008
02:24:58,179 --> 02:25:01,307
She played this drama
to swallow her wealth.

2009
02:25:02,049 --> 02:25:03,812
You didn't give me a pickle?
Now this marriage..

2010
02:25:03,918 --> 02:25:06,546
..won't take place.

2011
02:25:08,289 --> 02:25:09,313
Dhana.

2012
02:25:09,924 --> 02:25:13,360
Dhana Lakshmi. Dhana Lakshmi. Dhana.

2013
02:25:14,195 --> 02:25:15,321
How did he reach here?

2014
02:25:31,879 --> 02:25:34,973
Dhana. Dhana, open the door.
Don't do anything stupid.

2015
02:25:35,082 --> 02:25:36,913
l know how much you loved Balaji.

2016
02:25:37,451 --> 02:25:38,850
You can't commit suicide just
because you didn't get..

2017
02:25:38,953 --> 02:25:39,977
..the man you loved. Did
l commit suicide..

2018
02:25:40,087 --> 02:25:41,213
..just because l didn't get you?

2019
02:25:41,322 --> 02:25:42,846
l tried to unite you
with your Balaji..

2020
02:25:42,957 --> 02:25:44,982
..to show you that
my love is sincere.

2021
02:25:45,226 --> 02:25:47,854
You have to unite with Balaji..

2022
02:25:47,962 --> 02:25:49,862
..to prove the sincerity of your
love. Please, Dhana. Please.

2023
02:25:49,964 --> 02:25:51,864
Hey, what are you doing here?
- Rascal, you don't know..

2024
02:25:51,966 --> 02:25:54,127
..how much Dhana loved Balaji.

2025
02:25:54,235 --> 02:25:55,930
She will die without Balaji.

2026
02:25:58,239 --> 02:26:02,175
Hey! - Hey, how dare you !
How did you come here?

2027
02:26:02,276 --> 02:26:03,868
Hey, remove your hand! lf
you dare to touch him..

2028
02:26:03,978 --> 02:26:05,468
..l will behead you all.
You call her.

2029
02:26:06,247 --> 02:26:09,273
Dhana. Dhana, why do you think
you won't get Balaji?

2030
02:26:09,383 --> 02:26:11,283
l will bring Balaji at
any cost this time.

2031
02:26:11,385 --> 02:26:13,148
l will unite you with
him at any cost.

2032
02:26:13,254 --> 02:26:15,347
Trust me, Dhana. Trust me, Dhana.

2033
02:26:15,456 --> 02:26:18,050
Dhana. Dhana. Come outside, Dhana.

2034
02:26:18,325 --> 02:26:19,622
Please, Dhana. Open the door, Dhana.

2035
02:26:20,995 --> 02:26:24,556
Dhana, come outside.
Come outside, Dhana.

2036
02:26:25,199 --> 02:26:26,427
Dhana, open the door.

2037
02:26:33,407 --> 02:26:36,308
l will find out Balaji no
matter wherever he is.

2038
02:26:36,410 --> 02:26:37,638
Please, Dhana. Trust me.

2039
02:26:38,446 --> 02:26:40,437
l will find out wherever he is.

2040
02:26:45,286 --> 02:26:46,310
Nita.

2041
02:26:49,557 --> 02:26:51,047
We believed her words and came here.

2042
02:26:51,292 --> 02:26:53,226
We didn't realize that she
can do such a thing.

2043
02:26:53,327 --> 02:26:54,658
Thanks a lot, son.

2044
02:26:57,298 --> 02:27:00,324
Nitu, room no. 305.
Stay here this night.

2045
02:27:00,434 --> 02:27:02,095
Do not disturb Dhana.
- Alright.

2046
02:27:02,203 --> 02:27:03,500
l will come tomorrow morning.
- Alright.

2047
02:27:12,413 --> 02:27:15,348
Dhana, l can understand your pain.

2048
02:27:15,449 --> 02:27:18,350
They want your wealth and
you want your Balaji.

2049
02:27:18,452 --> 02:27:20,943
To cash your love for Balaji
since childhood..

2050
02:27:21,055 --> 02:27:23,580
..they did this with you.

2051
02:27:25,993 --> 02:27:28,962
Even if that person
was real Balaji..

2052
02:27:29,063 --> 02:27:31,361
..l wouldn't have married him.

2053
02:27:33,067 --> 02:27:36,503
Aravind is filled in my heart.

2054
02:27:39,073 --> 02:27:42,975
l mistook my childhood friendship
with Balaji as love..

2055
02:27:43,077 --> 02:27:46,274
..and fooled myself.

2056
02:27:51,218 --> 02:27:53,448
Now l understood what real love is.

2057
02:27:54,355 --> 02:27:57,051
l saw that pure form
of love in Aravind.

2058
02:27:57,158 --> 02:28:00,059
Then what's the delay for? Tell
Aravind about it right away.

2059
02:28:00,161 --> 02:28:03,995
Aravind took whatever l said
all these days about Balaji..

2060
02:28:04,098 --> 02:28:08,125
..as gospel truth. You heard
how he talked there..

2061
02:28:08,235 --> 02:28:11,136
Have you gone mad! Aravind
can understand you.

2062
02:28:11,372 --> 02:28:14,000
No, he will lose respect for me.

2063
02:28:14,108 --> 02:28:16,736
Don't assume things and
make a mistake again.

2064
02:28:17,111 --> 02:28:19,739
Tell Aravind about your love.
- Don't force me.

2065
02:28:20,614 --> 02:28:25,642
l should have told Aravind that
l love him before l met Balaji.

2066
02:28:27,388 --> 02:28:31,017
lf l tell him now he will
think that l am saying it..

2067
02:28:31,125 --> 02:28:34,583
..on rebound as that person
turned out to be fraud.

2068
02:28:36,397 --> 02:28:40,026
lt was my mistake. Ever
since the beginning..

2069
02:28:40,134 --> 02:28:42,659
..l mistook Aravind and said
a number of mean things.

2070
02:28:44,471 --> 02:28:49,238
l don't even deserve to
think about Aravind.

2071
02:28:50,678 --> 02:28:52,043
For Aravind l will be left as Dhana..

2072
02:28:52,146 --> 02:28:55,274
..who is in search
of Balaji forever.

2073
02:28:55,482 --> 02:28:58,315
Nitu, will you do me a favor?
- What?

2074
02:28:58,419 --> 02:29:02,617
We need to leave this place
before Aravind comes. - Why?

2075
02:29:03,157 --> 02:29:05,523
Please take me to Vizag
to your house.

2076
02:29:06,427 --> 02:29:10,056
Aravind shouldn't know
where l am. Please.

2077
02:29:25,246 --> 02:29:27,476
l feel what you are doing is wrong.

2078
02:29:45,633 --> 02:29:47,294
Where are you going
without telling me?

2079
02:29:48,736 --> 02:29:50,465
Did l become so cheap in your eyes?

2080
02:29:51,538 --> 02:29:53,733
You don't care about me just
because l like you, right?

2081
02:29:55,142 --> 02:29:57,474
Get down. Get down l said.

2082
02:29:58,479 --> 02:30:01,505
Aravind, why are you behaving
this way! - Hey, get down.

2083
02:30:04,718 --> 02:30:06,549
What?
- Look into my eyes.

2084
02:30:07,488 --> 02:30:09,854
Your eyes are saying it
that you love me. - No.

2085
02:30:10,224 --> 02:30:11,248
Team DG

2086
02:30:11,358 --> 02:30:12,382
Yes.
- No.

2087
02:30:12,493 --> 02:30:13,517
No.
- Yes.

2088
02:30:18,565 --> 02:30:19,589
Yes.

2089
02:30:22,236 --> 02:30:23,260
Aravind.

2090
02:30:25,706 --> 02:30:27,674
Aravind. Aravind.

2091
02:30:28,242 --> 02:30:29,266
Aravind.

2092
02:30:30,844 --> 02:30:31,868
Aravind.

2093
02:30:36,317 --> 02:30:42,278
Dhana Lakshmi.

2094
02:30:42,389 --> 02:30:46,382
Dhana Lakshmi.

2095
02:30:46,493 --> 02:30:50,293
Dhana Lakshmi.

2096
02:31:02,776 --> 02:31:06,177
How did it find out! Did you
really see my love for you..

2097
02:31:06,280 --> 02:31:09,249
..in my eyes? - No, your friend
called me and told me about it.

2098
02:31:14,822 --> 02:31:16,187
l thought you won't mend your ways..

2099
02:31:16,290 --> 02:31:18,656
..unless you are given such a
shock treatment. That's why..

2100
02:31:23,297 --> 02:31:26,323
Saroja, no. No, Saroja. No, dear.

2101
02:31:26,567 --> 02:31:29,536
Saroja, cool. Saroja. No, dear.

2102
02:31:29,636 --> 02:31:32,469
Saroja, cool. Cool.

2103
02:31:38,512 --> 02:31:39,774
Hey, are you watching some movie?

2104
02:31:39,880 --> 02:31:42,940
You are getting late for your
train. Get going. Go. - Bye-bye.

2105
02:32:06,273 --> 02:32:07,297
Excuse me!

2106
02:32:08,876 --> 02:32:11,470
You look like a nice pair.
Why are you so silent?

2107
02:32:11,578 --> 02:32:13,978
Any problem? - We are in a
relationship since ten years.

2108
02:32:14,615 --> 02:32:15,639
We are about to get
married in two days.

2109
02:32:15,749 --> 02:32:17,546
She sent wedding cards
to all her friends.

2110
02:32:17,751 --> 02:32:21,312
l too have a friend. She is a
girl friend since childhood.

2111
02:32:21,422 --> 02:32:23,515
l even gave her address
to invite her.

2112
02:32:23,624 --> 02:32:25,319
Now she says that she forgot it.

2113
02:32:25,626 --> 02:32:27,321
Why do you take it so seriously?

2114
02:32:27,428 --> 02:32:29,259
How else should l react!
What do you know..
