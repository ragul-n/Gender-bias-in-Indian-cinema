1
00:02:43,151 --> 00:02:44,471
Sachin, here

2
00:03:03,051 --> 00:03:04,451
Nitin, ball please

3
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:05,986
Who are the boys
in Shiva's team?

4
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:09,571
Wahib, Jai, Gopi, Napoleon

5
00:03:09,651 --> 00:03:10,851
I am in your team

6
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:17,691
'To choose or not to choose a friend
can be based on only 2 reasons'

7
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:19,891
'Either you like him
or hate him to the core'

8
00:03:19,931 --> 00:03:23,131
'This feeling of like or
dislike has no reason'

9
00:03:23,211 --> 00:03:24,651
'No use of analyzing either'

10
00:03:24,691 --> 00:03:26,811
'At least I didn't understand'

11
00:03:26,946 --> 00:03:31,146
'Nitin is Tamil Nadu's Youth star
hero Vijithkanth's only son'

12
00:03:31,531 --> 00:03:35,411
'His father's fans will celebrate
the film's release like a temple festival'

13
00:03:35,436 --> 00:03:36,996
'I have witnessed it firsthand'

14
00:03:37,513 --> 00:03:40,313
'Whatever his father does
will become headlines'

15
00:03:40,411 --> 00:03:43,851
'When Nitin joined our school
I've myself read it as news'

16
00:03:44,851 --> 00:03:48,091
'Nitin had no one to discipline him
or shower love on him'

17
00:03:48,131 --> 00:03:53,891
'He grew up in a lifestyle of
excess money, name and fame'

18
00:03:56,331 --> 00:03:58,811
'Nitin can be described
in just 3 words'

19
00:03:58,836 --> 00:03:59,556
'Game '

20
00:03:59,581 --> 00:04:00,381
'Fun'

21
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,726
'Friends'

22
00:04:02,037 --> 00:04:04,917
'He was zero in academics
but a hero in sports'

23
00:04:05,076 --> 00:04:06,996
'He is our school champion'

24
00:04:07,021 --> 00:04:09,221
'Just like the sons
of affluent parents'

25
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:10,891
'He had no responsibilities'

26
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:12,396
'And no worries at all'

27
00:04:22,993 --> 00:04:25,171
'He always had a gang of friends
hanging out with him'

28
00:04:25,211 --> 00:04:28,971
'Because of his dad's name
or whether they really liked him...'

29
00:04:29,011 --> 00:04:31,211
'...only his close friends will know'

30
00:04:31,331 --> 00:04:33,411
'Because I am not his friend'

31
00:04:42,411 --> 00:04:43,451
'I am Shiva'

32
00:04:43,531 --> 00:04:45,451
'Unlike Nitin I don't have
much to say about myself'

33
00:04:45,491 --> 00:04:46,811
'No money, name nor fame'

34
00:04:46,851 --> 00:04:49,291
'And my dad isn't
a celebrity either'

35
00:04:49,411 --> 00:04:53,571
'My wish, dream, goal, pastime
are all rolled into one'

36
00:04:53,771 --> 00:04:57,131
'To find out through my research
if we can survive in Mars'

37
00:04:57,931 --> 00:05:00,931
Last night I watched
our Youth star's film, dude

38
00:05:01,011 --> 00:05:03,411
Good god!
He rocks, man

39
00:05:03,451 --> 00:05:06,411
He takes a small handkerchief,
tucks it in his waist and shakes-

40
00:05:06,451 --> 00:05:08,251
He's taking a royal dig at your dad

41
00:05:08,411 --> 00:05:11,091
Poor girl! The heroine tries
to make up for his 2 left feet

42
00:05:11,491 --> 00:05:12,251
Awesome!

43
00:05:14,036 --> 00:05:16,836
- Want to act in a film?
- You want my ID card?

44
00:05:16,861 --> 00:05:17,861
Hey! What?

45
00:05:18,011 --> 00:05:19,531
Trying to create a scene?

46
00:05:19,826 --> 00:05:21,666
My dad is star for
the whole of Tamil Nadu

47
00:05:21,691 --> 00:05:23,931
Repeat that dialog
once more please

48
00:05:24,011 --> 00:05:27,171
'When it comes to love
I am Gandhi'

49
00:05:27,371 --> 00:05:29,011
'When it comes to violence...'

50
00:05:29,091 --> 00:05:31,371
'...I'll make mincemeat
out of my enemy!'

51
00:05:33,484 --> 00:05:35,684
'Nitin and I fight all the time'

52
00:05:35,771 --> 00:05:39,091
'Don't know if this is a rivalry
between money and studies'

53
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:41,451
'But thanks to him
I have lost my peace of mind'

54
00:05:41,491 --> 00:05:43,411
'My only slice
of happiness is...'

55
00:05:43,451 --> 00:05:44,451
'...Maya'

56
00:05:47,051 --> 00:05:50,531
'When no one else was aware
you entered my life to love and care'

57
00:05:50,571 --> 00:05:53,300
'You walked with zeal and zest
on Mother Earth's floral carpet'

58
00:05:53,432 --> 00:05:56,912
'If you go away, akin to losing my life
can I bear that pain and strife?'

59
00:05:57,054 --> 00:06:01,414
'My heart hugs you tight
in my mind with delight'

60
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:05,611
'Till the moment you are with me here
what's the Maya of my breath, dear?'

61
00:06:07,486 --> 00:06:09,326
- Shiva, come down
- My time will come!

62
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,790
Maya?

63
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:13,981
How did you like my poem?

64
00:06:14,588 --> 00:06:15,908
I didn't understand it

65
00:06:16,051 --> 00:06:17,731
Not even a single word?

66
00:06:19,251 --> 00:06:20,371
Doesn't matter

67
00:06:22,411 --> 00:06:24,011
My essay topic-

68
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:25,331
'If you see a girl...'

69
00:06:25,371 --> 00:06:27,253
'...a rocket should fly
within the heart's chamber'

70
00:06:27,278 --> 00:06:29,078
'The mind should tap
its feet to a folk song'

71
00:06:29,316 --> 00:06:32,756
'All this happened when
I first set eyes on Maya'

72
00:06:32,891 --> 00:06:36,171
'I always score 100/100
in all my subjects'

73
00:06:36,211 --> 00:06:39,491
'But when it comes to Maya
I haven't even scored 1 mark'

74
00:06:39,796 --> 00:06:43,796
'Understanding her is as tough as
the crime novels she likes to read'

75
00:06:44,331 --> 00:06:47,491
'Commissioner's daughter
So she's very bold and brave'

76
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,630
'In these 2 years...'

77
00:06:49,891 --> 00:06:52,091
'...Maya would have
spoken to me twice'

78
00:06:52,171 --> 00:06:54,011
'Even that was only to yell at me'

79
00:06:54,091 --> 00:06:57,611
'Even if the person we like only yells
a warm glow spreads in our heart'

80
00:06:57,651 --> 00:06:59,131
'I like it'

81
00:06:59,411 --> 00:07:01,011
'The way she yells at me'

82
00:07:01,051 --> 00:07:03,451
'Because she is my Maya'

83
00:07:39,491 --> 00:07:40,891
This is possible...

84
00:07:40,971 --> 00:07:48,491
...thanks to the cooperation from
our students, parents and teachers

85
00:07:48,611 --> 00:07:51,931
VRS group has many branches
all over Tamil Nadu

86
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:55,651
Must tell 'Godzilla' and shove
a pencil into his mouth like a spear

87
00:07:55,731 --> 00:07:58,771
But in this short period
we will be ranked #1

88
00:07:58,851 --> 00:08:04,211
You will be soon writing
your 10th and 12th grade exams

89
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:06,931
This is a crucial time for you

90
00:08:06,971 --> 00:08:10,211
You must focus only
on your studies now

91
00:08:10,371 --> 00:08:17,531
Take Shiva as a standing example for
being 1st in the State in 10th grade

92
00:08:22,131 --> 00:08:26,251
We believe he'll make our school proud
in the same way in 12th grade also

93
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:27,611
This guy is such an imbecile

94
00:08:27,651 --> 00:08:30,891
Thinking he is encouraging Shiva
he de-motivates and hurts us

95
00:08:30,931 --> 00:08:33,011
You should be as dedicated as him

96
00:08:33,051 --> 00:08:34,611
He's such a cat on the wall

97
00:08:34,691 --> 00:08:37,091
On school annual day, he will call
my dad and praise him

98
00:08:37,131 --> 00:08:39,571
If it is Sports day
he will praise me sky-high

99
00:08:39,611 --> 00:08:41,971
Let me see how Shiva stands
1st in the State this time

100
00:08:42,011 --> 00:08:46,691
Since UNESCO has
recognized Shiva's research...

101
00:08:46,731 --> 00:08:49,811
...and selected him as
All India Young Scientist

102
00:08:49,851 --> 00:08:52,091
...he has been invited
to speak in USA

103
00:09:13,331 --> 00:09:19,371
"1-2-3, you and I are free
In a fight I'm the referee"

104
00:09:19,451 --> 00:09:25,491
"Hey! You see, tea complementary
Why keep tabs and pay, pray tell me?"

105
00:09:25,571 --> 00:09:31,571
"In jet-speed school life races daily"

106
00:09:31,731 --> 00:09:37,691
"If you miss once, won't return repeatedly"

107
00:09:37,931 --> 00:09:40,800
"In your group, buddy
lie through your teeth glibly"

108
00:09:40,825 --> 00:09:43,985
"Each and every friend is priority"

109
00:10:20,091 --> 00:10:26,011
"In the life of a student, dude
lies a slogan to include"

110
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:32,211
"If there is access to freedom
sky is the play ground centrum"

111
00:10:32,411 --> 00:10:38,371
"Class teacher is not Hitler, dude
He's Mr Bean I hereby conclude"

112
00:10:38,531 --> 00:10:44,531
"Without a challenge life is boring
Face it bold and brave, be daring"

113
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:47,371
"If you get depressed
we'll be the balm to your stress"

114
00:10:47,411 --> 00:10:48,864
"We will laugh, dude
to make you laugh too"

115
00:10:49,071 --> 00:10:51,071
"Worries forgotten
Minds wide open"

116
00:11:27,731 --> 00:11:33,731
"Dream and aim at the star
Pearls of wisdom from Kalam sir"

117
00:11:33,851 --> 00:11:39,731
"Our dreams don't follow
a specific syllabus you know"

118
00:11:39,971 --> 00:11:46,051
"Don't stuff us with your pressure
For your sadistic pleasure"

119
00:11:46,131 --> 00:11:52,091
"Don't step into our space
We'll win at our own pace"

120
00:11:52,251 --> 00:11:55,331
"We got admission with great difficulty
Isn't being a student our identity?"

121
00:11:55,371 --> 00:11:58,651
"We are here to win
Let's rock and roll, double-spin"

122
00:12:17,251 --> 00:12:19,611
VRS school has set
a new record...

123
00:12:19,651 --> 00:12:22,025
...in the maximum number
of applications issued

124
00:12:22,328 --> 00:12:24,623
Sir, it has been reported in
'The Hindu' and 'Dinakaran'

125
00:12:24,764 --> 00:12:28,004
The Press has given our school
a very good coverage

126
00:12:29,011 --> 00:12:31,331
On the day dedicated to
Goddess of knowledge...

127
00:12:31,411 --> 00:12:34,891
...1,23,484 applications
have been registered

128
00:12:35,175 --> 00:12:39,415
At this rate, we can open
2 new schools after 2 years

129
00:12:41,475 --> 00:12:43,755
If we get ISO recognition...

130
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:46,703
...we can buy a printing press
to print our own application forms

131
00:12:46,728 --> 00:12:49,048
- What do you think, Sudandhiram?
- Good idea, sir

132
00:12:49,073 --> 00:12:51,873
We are eligible on all counts
to acquire ISO certificate

133
00:12:51,898 --> 00:12:52,778
But-

134
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:53,870
What?

135
00:12:53,895 --> 00:12:59,855
Pigs come in at the rear end of our school
through the broken compound wall

136
00:12:59,966 --> 00:13:02,846
If we patch that hole
we won't have any drawbacks

137
00:13:03,935 --> 00:13:06,375
Can't you take care
of this by yourself?

138
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,400
Sir, that part of the compound
belongs to Slum Clearance Board

139
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,700
We've extended our area
and built that wall

140
00:13:12,811 --> 00:13:14,784
That particular file is waiting
for approval at Govt level

141
00:13:14,935 --> 00:13:17,095
You have to do the needful

142
00:13:17,571 --> 00:13:18,651
Is that so?

143
00:13:18,676 --> 00:13:21,356
You first re-build
the compound wall

144
00:13:21,517 --> 00:13:23,557
I'll talk to the CMD officers

145
00:13:23,582 --> 00:13:25,302
ISO inspection is round the corner

146
00:13:25,365 --> 00:13:26,245
Take proper care

147
00:13:26,371 --> 00:13:28,011
We shouldn't face any problem

148
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:35,916
Stretch out your hand

149
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:37,199
Don't, sir

150
00:13:37,413 --> 00:13:38,453
Come near me

151
00:13:38,478 --> 00:13:39,338
Show me your hand

152
00:13:39,417 --> 00:13:41,137
- I don't like all this
- I won't eat in class

153
00:13:44,717 --> 00:13:48,517
If you keep eating
like a glutton...

154
00:13:48,542 --> 00:13:51,111
...Goddess Saraswathi
won't bless your brains

155
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,150
She'll only be a picture
on your bureau

156
00:13:53,175 --> 00:13:54,495
Waste fellow!

157
00:13:55,691 --> 00:13:57,171
'I will teach you a lesson one day!'

158
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,960
I want my book, sir

159
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:13,419
I borrowed it from our library

160
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:14,790
I have to return it

161
00:14:20,353 --> 00:14:22,593
I don't mind if you
don't know the answer

162
00:14:22,781 --> 00:14:25,461
But you don't even
understand the question, right?

163
00:14:46,691 --> 00:14:48,211
'Fine! I'll pay the fine'

164
00:14:54,295 --> 00:14:56,175
Kalpana ji, are you not
late for your class?

165
00:14:56,238 --> 00:14:57,358
No, sir

166
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:02,451
All you do is eat in
the canteen behind my back

167
00:15:02,491 --> 00:15:04,563
Do you ever think of
helping me date Maya?

168
00:15:04,643 --> 00:15:06,123
She ignores me totally

169
00:15:06,241 --> 00:15:07,561
What does she like?

170
00:15:07,765 --> 00:15:09,125
She loves books

171
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,270
You must use books
as a bait and trap her

172
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,480
What book shall I gift her?

173
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,600
David Boons

174
00:15:19,172 --> 00:15:21,932
Girls love these books

175
00:15:22,304 --> 00:15:24,624
David Boons is singular or plural?

176
00:15:24,844 --> 00:15:26,724
You'll be single
all your life

177
00:15:43,371 --> 00:15:44,891
Pick it up for me, please

178
00:15:44,971 --> 00:15:46,771
I'm holding too many books-

179
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,975
Why are you borrowing
so many books?

180
00:15:53,971 --> 00:15:56,072
This is the topic for my paper
to be submitted in UNESCO

181
00:15:56,307 --> 00:15:57,387
I was referring

182
00:16:00,269 --> 00:16:02,429
'Even Mars isn't making a mark on her!'

183
00:16:03,931 --> 00:16:07,411
Maya, have you read
books by David Boons?

184
00:16:07,451 --> 00:16:08,776
Feel-good books

185
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,081
Too good

186
00:16:13,651 --> 00:16:16,171
Has he started writing books
after playing cricket?

187
00:16:16,691 --> 00:16:18,051
Unbelievable

188
00:16:18,251 --> 00:16:20,731
Next time get the name right

189
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:21,811
That's Mills & Boon

190
00:16:21,891 --> 00:16:24,051
Not David Boon
The hook shot player

191
00:16:26,094 --> 00:16:27,654
'This is another no-ball, huh?'

192
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:30,639
'It may be easier to go to Mars
than get her to flip for me'

193
00:16:30,901 --> 00:16:32,221
Will you do me a favor?

194
00:16:32,246 --> 00:16:33,446
Yes, Maya

195
00:16:33,572 --> 00:16:35,402
Tell me when you'll be
coming to the library

196
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:36,307
I'll be glad to

197
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:38,301
I'll make sure
I don't come then

198
00:16:41,463 --> 00:16:43,703
Every child wants to
study in our school, sir

199
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:44,783
Please sit down

200
00:16:44,823 --> 00:16:50,463
Home minister wants
a seat for grade 1

201
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:53,543
I don't know if I am in
a position to comply even that

202
00:16:56,823 --> 00:16:57,983
Lord Muruga, bless me

203
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,543
I've heard a lot about you

204
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:03,063
I've got a chance
to meet you only now

205
00:17:03,103 --> 00:17:05,823
Are you from
the Devakottai belt?

206
00:17:05,863 --> 00:17:07,743
No, sir
Pattukottai

207
00:17:07,783 --> 00:17:09,223
That's also my area

208
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:13,023
I'll come straight to the point

209
00:17:13,063 --> 00:17:17,343
In the 10 years you have worked
as Physics teacher in that school...

210
00:17:17,383 --> 00:17:20,063
...it has benefitted
a lot from you

211
00:17:20,103 --> 00:17:23,303
Last year 10 students have
scored centum in Physics

212
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:24,783
In our school

213
00:17:35,023 --> 00:17:37,703
When will you join our school?

214
00:17:37,863 --> 00:17:39,303
Sir, the problem is-

215
00:17:39,423 --> 00:17:40,943
500000 cash

216
00:17:42,263 --> 00:17:44,103
6.5 lakhs per annum

217
00:17:44,183 --> 00:17:46,743
You can take tuition for
the students in school

218
00:17:46,783 --> 00:17:48,223
That income is all yours

219
00:17:48,263 --> 00:17:50,522
You don't have to part with
even 10 paise to the management

220
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:52,809
I am being paid well
in my present school, sir

221
00:17:52,943 --> 00:17:55,783
If I sell Saraswathi, the Goddess of
knowledge, I won't get her Grace, sir

222
00:17:55,823 --> 00:17:57,023
What is your wife's name?

223
00:17:57,063 --> 00:17:58,183
Lakshmi

224
00:17:59,093 --> 00:18:01,863
Go and discuss with
your Goddess of wealth, Lakshmi!

225
00:18:02,043 --> 00:18:03,163
And then decide

226
00:18:03,188 --> 00:18:04,868
I am not compelling you

227
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:09,303
Sir, I feel-

228
00:18:09,343 --> 00:18:11,567
I am so thankful
you took the effort to meet me

229
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:14,832
Go home, discuss
with your wife Lakshmi

230
00:18:14,983 --> 00:18:17,223
And come back
with a favorable reply

231
00:18:19,623 --> 00:18:21,863
Nandini, shall we
go out somewhere?

232
00:18:21,903 --> 00:18:25,463
When do you intend broaching
our wedding topic with your family?

233
00:18:25,702 --> 00:18:28,702
Only if we lose trust in love
marriage becomes a topic of discussion

234
00:18:30,837 --> 00:18:32,797
'Where has he gone?'

235
00:18:43,703 --> 00:18:45,663
Gawd! 30 missed calls

236
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:48,743
Let me manage somehow

237
00:18:48,783 --> 00:18:50,263
How many times to call you?

238
00:18:50,303 --> 00:18:51,303
You didn't pick my call

239
00:18:51,343 --> 00:18:52,423
I'm in the swimming pool

240
00:18:52,463 --> 00:18:54,143
Just rot there

241
00:18:54,183 --> 00:18:55,983
You said we could
go out this evening

242
00:18:56,023 --> 00:18:57,543
I've booked tickets for a movie

243
00:18:58,103 --> 00:18:58,903
Come over here

244
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,455
What is the point
of me coming there?

245
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,600
I can't do all that

246
00:19:01,743 --> 00:19:03,703
I have a surprise for you

247
00:19:03,783 --> 00:19:04,623
Come, Nandini

248
00:19:04,663 --> 00:19:06,383
We'll go to the theater
together from here

249
00:19:06,423 --> 00:19:08,023
- Just for my sake
- Okay

250
00:19:10,423 --> 00:19:12,503
I'll go to the restroom

251
00:19:17,503 --> 00:19:18,623
Why are you here?

252
00:19:18,703 --> 00:19:19,263
Out

253
00:19:19,303 --> 00:19:21,383
I told you I have
a surprise for you

254
00:19:21,547 --> 00:19:22,543
Don't play the fool, Sridhar

255
00:19:22,623 --> 00:19:23,583
Out...step out

256
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,703
Don't you want to know
what the surprise is?

257
00:19:26,743 --> 00:19:28,183
Don't, Sridhar

258
00:19:28,783 --> 00:19:29,983
Don't do this

259
00:19:30,023 --> 00:19:31,903
Someone might come in here

260
00:19:32,063 --> 00:19:33,703
Don't be scared, Nandini

261
00:19:33,743 --> 00:19:36,383
No one will come
at this time of day

262
00:19:36,423 --> 00:19:39,943
So you planned all this

263
00:19:40,183 --> 00:19:42,543
Only then it will
be a surprise!

264
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,423
Don't, Sridhar

265
00:19:45,663 --> 00:19:47,463
Listen to me

266
00:19:52,743 --> 00:19:53,903
Enough

267
00:19:56,263 --> 00:19:57,743
Turn off the light

268
00:19:57,783 --> 00:19:59,343
Then how will you unlock the gate?

269
00:19:59,383 --> 00:20:01,303
As if the one who locked won't know!

270
00:20:01,343 --> 00:20:02,885
You land up at 10:00 p.m
all of a sudden

271
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,470
I can't handle the security here

272
00:20:04,592 --> 00:20:06,072
Why do you get
so stressed out?

273
00:20:06,183 --> 00:20:08,223
If anyone finds out
about your nocturnal visits...

274
00:20:08,263 --> 00:20:10,023
...I'll be minus a job
and penniless

275
00:20:10,063 --> 00:20:11,486
Then build a proper compound wall

276
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:13,671
As if that will stop you
from coming in at night

277
00:20:13,696 --> 00:20:14,376
Is that so?

278
00:20:14,543 --> 00:20:16,063
Fine, I won't come hereafter

279
00:20:16,543 --> 00:20:18,543
Why do you get annoyed?

280
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:19,823
It was meant to be a joke!

281
00:20:19,863 --> 00:20:22,023
Come and go as you please
Do whatever you want

282
00:20:22,063 --> 00:20:24,143
But I am the villain
in your dad's next film!

283
00:20:24,183 --> 00:20:26,743
It's either Prakash Raj or
me Selvaraj, make up your mind

284
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:29,528
- I got you a chance in his last film
- That's what you think!

285
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,583
They shot for 3 days

286
00:20:31,623 --> 00:20:35,343
I went to the theater with such high hopes
I had to search for my face on the screen!

287
00:20:36,663 --> 00:20:39,143
Mr Villain, instead of
troubling yourself...

288
00:20:39,183 --> 00:20:41,198
...why don't you
give me a spare key?

289
00:20:41,459 --> 00:20:43,623
I know what I had to face
when I did that 1 ½ years ago

290
00:20:43,663 --> 00:20:45,023
Go and finish your job!

291
00:21:19,463 --> 00:21:21,663
Hey Mug-pot!
Why are you dull?

292
00:21:21,743 --> 00:21:22,943
Not swimming?

293
00:21:24,543 --> 00:21:26,903
What's the problem
between you and Shiva?

294
00:21:28,543 --> 00:21:31,903
Everyone knows Neil Armstrong
was the 1st man to land on the moon

295
00:21:31,943 --> 00:21:35,543
Not many know Edwin Aldrin
who was the 2nd man to do so

296
00:21:35,703 --> 00:21:37,903
2 people landed on the moon?

297
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,223
Is it such a big crime
to score 2nd rank?

298
00:21:40,263 --> 00:21:42,463
I was only 3 marks behind

299
00:21:42,983 --> 00:21:46,383
No one is recognizing me
because I got the 2nd rank

300
00:21:46,743 --> 00:21:48,983
I'm trying my best
to be 1st in class

301
00:21:53,783 --> 00:21:54,863
You want to be 1st in class

302
00:21:54,903 --> 00:21:56,383
- That's all?
- How?

303
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:02,162
Were the questions easy?

304
00:22:06,223 --> 00:22:07,863
Why are you panting?

305
00:22:08,132 --> 00:22:09,663
I need a favor from you, ma'am

306
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:11,063
Sure, shoot

307
00:22:11,219 --> 00:22:13,099
Shiva shouldn't get
the 1st rank this time

308
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:14,964
Instead Ganapathy should

309
00:22:15,023 --> 00:22:17,343
If he does well in the exam
he'll definitely stand first

310
00:22:17,383 --> 00:22:19,663
Even if he hasn't fared well
he should be 1st in class

311
00:22:19,703 --> 00:22:21,423
Otherwise I'll make it happen

312
00:22:23,124 --> 00:22:24,764
Are you threatening me?

313
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,570
Shall I report this
to the Principal?

314
00:22:27,743 --> 00:22:29,383
Why are you in such a hurry?

315
00:22:32,396 --> 00:22:34,676
You won't spend 5 minutes for me

316
00:22:34,701 --> 00:22:37,461
Take a look at this video
And we can walk together

317
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:48,943
You have to agree
to my request now

318
00:23:00,063 --> 00:23:02,303
God! Why do such things
happen only to me?

319
00:23:10,143 --> 00:23:12,903
If I don't listen to him he claims
he'll upload our video on Youtube

320
00:23:12,943 --> 00:23:14,023
He's blackmailing me

321
00:23:14,063 --> 00:23:15,343
Don't panic

322
00:23:15,783 --> 00:23:17,023
I'll handle him

323
00:23:38,023 --> 00:23:38,783
Nothing

324
00:23:38,823 --> 00:23:40,983
'So far I've been doing
whatever you asked me to'

325
00:23:41,023 --> 00:23:42,783
She thinks she owns the notice board

326
00:23:42,823 --> 00:23:44,143
'But I can't do this'

327
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,530
'Sowmya hasn't paid the fees?'

328
00:24:20,621 --> 00:24:22,141
What are you doing here?

329
00:24:23,583 --> 00:24:25,223
First let's go down

330
00:24:25,604 --> 00:24:28,284
You go now, Maya
I'll come down in a bit

331
00:24:30,383 --> 00:24:31,423
Nothing-

332
00:24:31,463 --> 00:24:32,543
Let me read

333
00:24:33,303 --> 00:24:34,983
Please don't

334
00:24:38,063 --> 00:24:40,063
'Nitin is responsible for my death'

335
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,413
Sowmya, what does this mean?

336
00:24:49,903 --> 00:24:51,383
You've not been your usual self

337
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:54,383
Your name is on the notice board in
the 'late payment of fees' list

338
00:25:02,758 --> 00:25:05,918
'I was attracted to Nitin
the 1st time I met him in school'

339
00:25:05,943 --> 00:25:07,303
'He felt the same way too'

340
00:25:07,343 --> 00:25:10,783
'Every second I spent with him
gave me immense happiness'

341
00:25:11,103 --> 00:25:14,023
'Besides meeting him in school...'

342
00:25:14,063 --> 00:25:16,303
'...I used to visit him often at his place'

343
00:25:16,343 --> 00:25:19,903
'I have seen his dad too
when I visited him'

344
00:25:19,983 --> 00:25:24,423
'I was so thrilled that such a popular
celebrity's son was in love with me'

345
00:25:24,463 --> 00:25:26,623
'So I complied
to every wish of his'

346
00:25:26,703 --> 00:25:27,703
'But-'

347
00:25:28,623 --> 00:25:30,623
- What happened?
- When did you take this video?

348
00:25:30,663 --> 00:25:31,703
When we were having fun

349
00:25:31,743 --> 00:25:32,503
Delete it

350
00:25:32,543 --> 00:25:33,063
Why?

351
00:25:33,103 --> 00:25:34,703
Even my friends haven't
seen it as yet

352
00:25:34,743 --> 00:25:39,223
'Only then I realized I was one among
a bevy of girls whom he had tricked'

353
00:25:41,183 --> 00:25:42,503
Brought it?

354
00:25:44,263 --> 00:25:45,423
Look at that!

355
00:25:46,143 --> 00:25:47,503
Delete that video now

356
00:25:47,583 --> 00:25:48,423
All in good time

357
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:49,143
Go now

358
00:25:49,183 --> 00:25:50,543
You will never prosper in life

359
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:52,623
I don't know how to
come out of this disgrace

360
00:25:52,663 --> 00:25:54,383
Is suicide the solution?

361
00:26:04,084 --> 00:26:05,404
What are you doing?

362
00:26:23,863 --> 00:26:27,263
Sowmya, come
I'll handle it

363
00:26:27,463 --> 00:26:30,063
- He's waiting, Maya
- I'll handle him, you go

364
00:26:35,703 --> 00:26:38,583
- Nitin, 1 minute
- Tell me...what?

365
00:26:39,783 --> 00:26:40,903
Tell me...what?

366
00:26:41,063 --> 00:26:42,743
I need to talk to you
about Sowmya

367
00:26:42,823 --> 00:26:44,703
What do you have
to say about her?

368
00:26:45,463 --> 00:26:47,463
'Why is Maya
talking to Nitin?'

369
00:26:47,503 --> 00:26:49,703
She won't agree to
all your demands anymore

370
00:26:49,743 --> 00:26:52,343
We are going steady
Who are you to barge in?

371
00:26:53,252 --> 00:26:55,412
Scumbag!
Don't lie

372
00:26:55,437 --> 00:26:56,837
You are using her

373
00:26:56,903 --> 00:26:57,703
Stop it

374
00:26:57,836 --> 00:26:59,676
Delete everything now
Right in front of me

375
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,781
'I don't know what is
going on between them'

376
00:27:02,703 --> 00:27:04,423
Only 10 minutes left
Let's go to the canteen

377
00:27:04,463 --> 00:27:06,503
- No, I'm not coming
- Are you sick or what?

378
00:27:06,528 --> 00:27:07,968
Or you don't have money?

379
00:27:08,261 --> 00:27:10,023
Nitin and Maya are
all alone in the classroom

380
00:27:10,063 --> 00:27:11,423
Let them have fun

381
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,623
Let's go to the canteen

382
00:27:12,718 --> 00:27:15,558
Why are they having a private chat?

383
00:27:15,699 --> 00:27:18,583
First he didn't love her but now
his mind is all green with jealousy

384
00:27:18,623 --> 00:27:20,903
If it bugs you so much
why don't you go and see?

385
00:27:20,943 --> 00:27:22,543
It won't be decent
to barge in

386
00:27:25,132 --> 00:27:26,252
Delete?

387
00:27:26,863 --> 00:27:28,463
Can do, no worries, sweetie

388
00:27:28,503 --> 00:27:30,743
Either ask her to come
or you come instead

389
00:27:30,783 --> 00:27:32,143
I'll let her go

390
00:27:37,503 --> 00:27:38,743
Don't underestimate me

391
00:27:38,783 --> 00:27:40,503
I am not a scaredy cat

392
00:27:40,543 --> 00:27:42,823
She has written a note
blaming you for her death

393
00:27:42,863 --> 00:27:45,023
If you harass her
with your calls...

394
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:47,343
...she'll go up
and you'll go in!

395
00:27:47,383 --> 00:27:48,583
It's your call

396
00:27:49,063 --> 00:27:51,303
They are so deep
in conversation!

397
00:27:52,503 --> 00:27:54,463
'A compass is used to
draw a circle normally'

398
00:27:54,503 --> 00:27:56,783
'She is planning
something abnormally'

399
00:28:00,703 --> 00:28:01,903
Hey 'machi'

400
00:28:01,983 --> 00:28:03,183
What happened?

401
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,143
Girls pierce their ears

402
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,023
This one pierced him
with a compass!

403
00:28:07,165 --> 00:28:09,143
Will you talk in such a way
I can understand?

404
00:28:09,183 --> 00:28:11,583
Nothing is going on between them

405
00:28:11,638 --> 00:28:13,398
Just this small compass

406
00:28:13,423 --> 00:28:14,863
They are fighting with each other

407
00:28:14,903 --> 00:28:16,863
- Why?
- Don't know

408
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:18,663
Some difference of opinion

409
00:28:18,703 --> 00:28:19,983
That's cool

410
00:28:20,374 --> 00:28:22,094
I got tense thinking
they like each other

411
00:28:22,343 --> 00:28:24,943
At least now can we
go to the canteen?

412
00:28:25,063 --> 00:28:27,503
'Maya...as if you can
escape my net!'

413
00:28:27,543 --> 00:28:30,463
No big deal
Why stress yourself?

414
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,823
Today is Zain's birthday
Let's celebrate it in style

415
00:28:32,918 --> 00:28:35,276
We'll go to your dad's farmhouse
And chill out with a party

416
00:28:35,322 --> 00:28:38,562
First give me a gift for
the chocolates you ate!

417
00:28:38,743 --> 00:28:39,743
Gift is what you need?

418
00:28:39,783 --> 00:28:41,143
My hug is the biggest gift ever

419
00:28:41,183 --> 00:28:42,063
Don't crush me

420
00:28:42,103 --> 00:28:43,023
Who wants your gift?

421
00:28:43,063 --> 00:28:44,343
If a girl hugs it's fine, huh?

422
00:28:44,383 --> 00:28:45,623
- Of course
- How partial!

423
00:28:46,908 --> 00:28:48,708
- Give me that sweet box
- Why?

424
00:28:48,943 --> 00:28:50,303
Sam, hold it

425
00:28:50,863 --> 00:28:52,303
What's your plan, 'machi'?

426
00:28:59,354 --> 00:29:01,354
I'll handle it

427
00:29:08,543 --> 00:29:09,583
What's up?

428
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:10,943
Today is my birthday

429
00:29:20,783 --> 00:29:22,303
Hey Maya
1 minute

430
00:29:24,543 --> 00:29:25,583
What's up?

431
00:29:25,623 --> 00:29:26,863
It's my birthday today

432
00:29:30,423 --> 00:29:31,503
Take 1 more

433
00:29:35,586 --> 00:29:37,426
No gift for me, huh?

434
00:29:40,014 --> 00:29:41,494
You should have told me earlier

435
00:29:42,183 --> 00:29:44,983
A hug from you
is the biggest gift ever

436
00:29:52,543 --> 00:29:53,783
I know what you're up to

437
00:29:53,823 --> 00:29:54,863
What?

438
00:30:02,023 --> 00:30:03,663
Are you absolutely brainless?

439
00:30:04,028 --> 00:30:05,623
How cheap can you get?

440
00:30:05,663 --> 00:30:06,943
Listen to me, Maya

441
00:30:06,983 --> 00:30:07,943
You got me wrong

442
00:30:07,983 --> 00:30:08,863
If you hug him-

443
00:30:08,903 --> 00:30:10,023
If I do...what?

444
00:30:10,103 --> 00:30:12,783
What's wrong if I hug him
and wish him for his birthday?

445
00:30:12,983 --> 00:30:15,663
Why do you over react
and embarrass me like this?

446
00:30:16,829 --> 00:30:18,789
Nothing wrong in wishing him
for his birthday

447
00:30:18,814 --> 00:30:21,463
But he has an ulterior motive
You won't understand

448
00:30:21,503 --> 00:30:23,383
Nitin is the root cause of all this

449
00:30:23,583 --> 00:30:24,863
Hey Sam!

450
00:30:25,758 --> 00:30:28,838
You're using Nitin's name
and acting so cheap, right?

451
00:30:28,863 --> 00:30:30,263
You got me all wrong, Maya

452
00:30:30,358 --> 00:30:31,998
Don't blame him
for your mistake

453
00:30:32,023 --> 00:30:33,223
Listen to me please

454
00:30:33,783 --> 00:30:35,343
Don't misunderstand me

455
00:31:07,663 --> 00:31:14,423
"You are like no other; extraordinary
I'm like many others; ordinary"

456
00:31:14,503 --> 00:31:17,263
"We met one day"

457
00:31:17,303 --> 00:31:20,703
"When and why did we lose our way?"

458
00:31:20,743 --> 00:31:27,583
"You are unique; extraordinary
I'm quite common; ordinary"

459
00:31:27,663 --> 00:31:30,543
"We met one fine day"

460
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:34,055
"When and why did we lose our way?"

461
00:31:34,303 --> 00:31:38,743
"I saw you walking far away"

462
00:31:40,983 --> 00:31:46,383
"Did you notice me near you…hey?"

463
00:31:47,623 --> 00:31:54,343
"We see, smile at each other
We walk together"

464
00:31:54,423 --> 00:32:00,663
"All this is a fantasy, darling
My mind's wishful thinking"

465
00:32:27,343 --> 00:32:34,063
"In the streets you travel
many days I stood to revel"

466
00:32:34,103 --> 00:32:40,703
"From your head that never turned
fell a few flowers instead"

467
00:32:40,743 --> 00:32:46,863
"Into the breeze I banged suddenly
I got hurt in the bargain badly"

468
00:32:47,223 --> 00:32:52,383
"Looking for you, I lost my mind duly"

469
00:32:53,983 --> 00:33:00,183
"Eyes played 'sadugudu' breathlessly
You haunt even my dreams boundlessly"

470
00:33:40,383 --> 00:33:47,023
"When you are not beside me
my clock's hand stops blindly"

471
00:33:47,063 --> 00:33:53,503
"Looking at me soulfully
whisper at least one word to me"

472
00:33:53,543 --> 00:33:59,583
"I hate holidays absolutely"

473
00:34:00,223 --> 00:34:05,383
"I need to see you face to face daily"

474
00:34:06,983 --> 00:34:11,663
"Can I ever forget, tell me
your single glance hesitantly?"

475
00:34:26,943 --> 00:34:33,383
"You are like no other; extraordinary
I'm like many others; ordinary"

476
00:34:33,463 --> 00:34:36,223
"We met one day"

477
00:34:36,303 --> 00:34:39,623
"When and why did we lose our way?"

478
00:34:39,743 --> 00:34:46,703
"You are unique; extraordinary
I'm quite common; ordinary"

479
00:34:46,743 --> 00:34:49,463
"We met one fine day"

480
00:34:49,543 --> 00:34:52,903
"When and why did we lose our way?"

481
00:34:53,343 --> 00:34:57,143
"I saw you walking far away"

482
00:34:59,943 --> 00:35:04,183
"Did you notice me near you…hey?"

483
00:35:06,743 --> 00:35:13,183
"We see, smile at each other
We walk together"

484
00:35:13,223 --> 00:35:19,143
"All this is a fantasy, darling
My mind's wishful thinking"

485
00:36:17,882 --> 00:36:20,522
Why are our students
playing with a pig?

486
00:36:23,988 --> 00:36:26,948
We haven't built a compound wall yet
Looks like pigs come through that

487
00:36:26,988 --> 00:36:28,508
That's what we haven’t
been able to fix!

488
00:36:28,548 --> 00:36:29,788
Chase the pig away

489
00:36:29,828 --> 00:36:31,468
Madam asked me to
bring the car home

490
00:36:31,508 --> 00:36:34,028
That isn't important
First chase that pig away

491
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:38,628
Why don't you trust me?

492
00:36:58,468 --> 00:37:00,708
I know how to deal with him

493
00:37:36,748 --> 00:37:38,068
Lord Muruga, help me

494
00:37:38,164 --> 00:37:39,324
What's this, Mr Sridhar?

495
00:37:39,388 --> 00:37:41,908
Why is all this happening?
That too before our ISO inspection?

496
00:37:41,988 --> 00:37:44,542
Had Shiva not been there,
it would've been disastrous

497
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:46,542
It's just an accident
that happened unknowingly

498
00:37:46,567 --> 00:37:48,487
What occurs unknowingly
is only an accident

499
00:37:48,748 --> 00:37:51,068
Is it a T20 cricket match
to be fixed earlier?

500
00:37:51,324 --> 00:37:53,508
Maya mixed the wrong chemical
That's why it exploded

501
00:37:53,548 --> 00:37:54,903
Nitin had deliberately changed it

502
00:37:54,928 --> 00:37:56,088
How do you know that?

503
00:37:56,252 --> 00:37:57,988
- Shiva told me
- What is this, sir?

504
00:37:58,053 --> 00:37:59,933
Do you sound like
a responsible teacher?

505
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:03,668
You're passing the buck on
to others like students do

506
00:38:03,708 --> 00:38:05,748
You've actually been very careless

507
00:38:05,788 --> 00:38:06,948
Sir, please warn Nitin

508
00:38:06,988 --> 00:38:08,548
He's making 1 mistake after another

509
00:38:08,643 --> 00:38:11,163
Why are you so against Nitin?

510
00:38:11,333 --> 00:38:14,108
The other day I saw you
beat him up in front of everyone

511
00:38:14,148 --> 00:38:16,588
He's the son of a super star
Don't forget that

512
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:18,148
Our school needs him
as our student

513
00:38:18,188 --> 00:38:21,028
Managing a school
is not child's play, sir

514
00:38:21,148 --> 00:38:23,708
You were careless enough to
leave the chemical cupboard open

515
00:38:23,748 --> 00:38:26,308
...and you were on the phone
That's why it exploded

516
00:38:26,348 --> 00:38:27,188
No, sir

517
00:38:27,708 --> 00:38:29,268
Nitin explained everything

518
00:38:29,513 --> 00:38:31,988
- Listen to me, sir
- You are to blame totally

519
00:38:32,028 --> 00:38:34,628
You can go now, make sure
it doesn't happen again

520
00:38:38,188 --> 00:38:40,068
Lord Muruga!
Shower your Grace on me

521
00:38:46,108 --> 00:38:47,628
Do you want a cool drink, Maya?

522
00:39:22,523 --> 00:39:24,083
Hey! Move aside

523
00:39:24,108 --> 00:39:26,148
Let him get some fresh air

524
00:39:26,228 --> 00:39:27,748
- Move...move
- What happened?

525
00:39:27,868 --> 00:39:31,068
Could it be seizures?
He's foaming from the mouth

526
00:39:31,108 --> 00:39:34,228
Gopi, please open your eyes
Has anyone informed our Principal?

527
00:39:34,308 --> 00:39:35,708
What happened to Gopi?

528
00:39:35,788 --> 00:39:37,988
Please move, what happened?
Is it poison?

529
00:39:38,028 --> 00:39:40,468
It's food poisoning
Call the school doctor

530
00:39:40,548 --> 00:39:42,588
Inform an ambulance too
All that's not necessary

531
00:39:42,628 --> 00:39:44,708
He must have fainted
because of too much heat

532
00:39:44,748 --> 00:39:46,868
Careful of his arm, move aside

533
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:48,388
Carry him that way

534
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:49,508
Make way

535
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,948
'If it is food poisoning, there won't
be any foaming from the mouth!'

536
00:40:01,428 --> 00:40:05,228
All he had was a cool drink and
'samosa' from our canteen

537
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,420
Hello, please come

538
00:40:10,308 --> 00:40:12,868
Inspector, would you like
to have coffee or tea?

539
00:40:12,908 --> 00:40:13,966
Give me anything you want

540
00:40:13,991 --> 00:40:15,951
But please make sure
it's not adulterated!

541
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:17,758
I'm coming here straight
from the hospital

542
00:40:17,908 --> 00:40:19,188
Is anyone unwell?

543
00:40:19,308 --> 00:40:21,788
Your school correspondent
would have fallen sick

544
00:40:21,828 --> 00:40:24,308
Doctors have confirmed
the student has consumed poison

545
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,148
That's purely an accident

546
00:40:26,188 --> 00:40:28,468
He was suffering
only from food poisoning

547
00:40:28,682 --> 00:40:30,988
You're only a Principal
Not a doctor, right?

548
00:40:31,068 --> 00:40:34,268
Can't hide information from me like
you do with your students and parents

549
00:40:34,308 --> 00:40:36,275
In the swimming pool
in your school 18 months ago...

550
00:40:36,414 --> 00:40:37,734
...your student was found dead

551
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:39,308
I passed it off
as an accident case

552
00:40:39,348 --> 00:40:41,268
A boy you expelled 2 years ago...

553
00:40:41,348 --> 00:40:43,668
...wrote a complaint against
your school and killed himself

554
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:45,819
I prevented that note
from reaching the media

555
00:40:45,957 --> 00:40:47,477
Why dig into the past now?

556
00:40:47,588 --> 00:40:50,068
If the past is forgotten,
how will you take care of me?

557
00:40:50,148 --> 00:40:52,228
I've been supporting you
completely, right?

558
00:40:52,268 --> 00:40:53,748
Rs 200,000

559
00:40:54,357 --> 00:40:55,757
This concerns doctors

560
00:40:55,908 --> 00:40:57,508
- You know it too
- I understand

561
00:41:01,908 --> 00:41:03,708
Hereafter law will do its duty

562
00:41:03,748 --> 00:41:05,588
I'm taking a lot of risks
for your sake, sir

563
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:10,726
See you, Principal sir

564
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:12,428
What is this, Sudandhiram?

565
00:41:12,468 --> 00:41:15,468
I'll be patient only until
we get the ISO recognition

566
00:41:15,988 --> 00:41:18,868
To save the school's image,
I'm willing to do anything

567
00:41:19,988 --> 00:41:21,948
Problems mushroom in
real estate and politics

568
00:41:21,988 --> 00:41:23,948
But is it the same case
in running schools too?

569
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:26,948
Violence has increased
considerably in our society

570
00:41:31,908 --> 00:41:33,188
What's this?

571
00:41:33,213 --> 00:41:34,450
You've scored 8%!

572
00:41:34,475 --> 00:41:36,475
How will you pass
the board exam?

573
00:41:36,868 --> 00:41:38,588
I'll do better next time, sir

574
00:41:39,376 --> 00:41:40,856
What does your father do?

575
00:41:41,228 --> 00:41:42,468
He's in real estate business

576
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:44,637
Your mother...?

577
00:41:44,662 --> 00:41:46,142
She works in a bank

578
00:41:55,523 --> 00:41:56,803
Sir, we are Indu's parents

579
00:41:56,828 --> 00:41:58,228
We heard you wanted to meet us?

580
00:41:58,348 --> 00:42:00,991
Indu has been absent
for 22 days this term

581
00:42:01,016 --> 00:42:03,696
What are you saying, sir?
Absent for 22 days?

582
00:42:03,908 --> 00:42:06,428
Do we pay a hefty school fees
to hear you tell us this?

583
00:42:08,388 --> 00:42:10,948
This won't work
We'll talk to your correspondent

584
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:13,949
This is typical attitude
from the parents

585
00:42:14,388 --> 00:42:17,148
As soon as you become a parent
you shower her with hugs

586
00:42:17,188 --> 00:42:19,828
When she starts walking
you admit her in a nursery school

587
00:42:19,868 --> 00:42:21,785
And heave a sigh of relief
thinking your duty is over

588
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:24,410
It isn't enough if you pay
the school fees every month

589
00:42:24,435 --> 00:42:28,075
She will be taught by various teachers
from nursery, primary, high school to me

590
00:42:28,184 --> 00:42:30,384
Next in college, some other
professor will teach her

591
00:42:30,542 --> 00:42:31,747
Teachers will keep changing

592
00:42:31,933 --> 00:42:34,293
But parents remain the same

593
00:42:35,668 --> 00:42:37,588
If you want your child
to fare well in life...

594
00:42:37,708 --> 00:42:40,854
...when walking on the road or driving,
you must teach her the basic traffic rules

595
00:42:40,879 --> 00:42:43,079
Only if she is taught to
stop at the amber light...

596
00:42:43,207 --> 00:42:45,247
...will she be steady
in whatever she does

597
00:42:45,393 --> 00:42:47,233
Indu is capable of studying well

598
00:42:47,708 --> 00:42:49,628
That's why I wanted
to see you in person

599
00:42:54,148 --> 00:42:56,068
You can tell anyone
You'll still be in a mess

600
00:42:56,108 --> 00:42:57,868
Don't rake up the past
unnecessarily, Indu

601
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:59,228
Get it into your head

602
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:05,548
Why are you hanging around here?

603
00:43:05,628 --> 00:43:07,695
I need the key
to our Science lab

604
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,040
You plan to study or what?

605
00:43:09,065 --> 00:43:10,305
I need it
It's urgent

606
00:43:10,383 --> 00:43:11,543
What a wonderful reply!

607
00:43:11,685 --> 00:43:14,495
- Can you give me the key or not?
- Temper tantrum, huh?

608
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,520
Yov! You think I can't do
anything without you?

609
00:43:16,701 --> 00:43:18,141
Wait and watch
how I get the key

610
00:43:18,228 --> 00:43:19,311
Challenging me?

611
00:43:19,336 --> 00:43:20,951
Go before I clobber you

612
00:43:21,285 --> 00:43:23,965
I'll tell the Principal and
make sure you get fired today

613
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:27,506
In case something like that happens,
I'll split your head into two!

614
00:43:27,531 --> 00:43:29,091
After all you're a driver

615
00:43:29,116 --> 00:43:30,396
How dare you challenge me?

616
00:43:30,607 --> 00:43:32,407
- I know how to deal with you
- All the best

617
00:43:32,432 --> 00:43:34,272
You nasty Peeping Tom!

618
00:43:48,108 --> 00:43:49,388
Give it to me

619
00:43:52,828 --> 00:43:54,388
You are doing something else

620
00:43:55,668 --> 00:43:57,963
I'm finding something new
To be selected by UNESCO

621
00:43:58,101 --> 00:43:59,901
No one has thought
of this till now

622
00:44:00,068 --> 00:44:01,428
Take a look

623
00:44:01,934 --> 00:44:04,734
You can do your research later
This is a test

624
00:44:05,157 --> 00:44:06,847
Work with the salt
that's given to you

625
00:44:06,872 --> 00:44:08,072
Otherwise you'll fail

626
00:44:08,158 --> 00:44:09,118
Fail...?

627
00:44:09,237 --> 00:44:11,597
Until now I've never
flunked, Sridhar sir

628
00:44:11,948 --> 00:44:14,548
Why should I worry?
Won't you help me?

629
00:44:15,343 --> 00:44:17,423
You have no choice
but to help me

630
00:44:17,628 --> 00:44:19,028
What do you say, Sridhar sir?

631
00:44:19,526 --> 00:44:20,886
Are you threatening me?

632
00:44:20,911 --> 00:44:22,991
You can't sidestep me
and do a damn thing

633
00:44:23,188 --> 00:44:25,228
True, can't do anything

634
00:44:25,268 --> 00:44:26,788
Why should I threaten you?

635
00:44:27,348 --> 00:44:28,908
If I show, what has to be shown...

636
00:44:28,948 --> 00:44:30,388
...then it is your call

637
00:44:32,708 --> 00:44:34,628
Wait and watch
how I deal with you

638
00:44:47,829 --> 00:44:50,269
How many times I have
offered you money, dear God?!

639
00:44:54,982 --> 00:44:56,502
Who is breaking my penance?

640
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,567
- She's calling you
- Oh! Miss, huh?

641
00:45:01,188 --> 00:45:02,828
How much did you get?

642
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:06,990
What...?

643
00:45:07,156 --> 00:45:09,356
Try to score a sixer
at least next time

644
00:45:09,428 --> 00:45:11,576
She has evaluated my paper
when she was sleepy I'm sure

645
00:45:11,818 --> 00:45:13,588
Otherwise I would've
got a big fat zero!

646
00:45:17,708 --> 00:45:19,308
I know I can't get 1st mark

647
00:45:19,388 --> 00:45:21,868
- Let's wait
- As if you're a magician!

648
00:45:21,997 --> 00:45:23,797
Even better...God!

649
00:45:23,988 --> 00:45:24,788
Wait and watch

650
00:46:13,348 --> 00:46:14,828
Any mistake with the totaling...?

651
00:46:14,868 --> 00:46:16,948
Are you saying I valued it wrong?

652
00:46:16,988 --> 00:46:17,948
I didn't mean that

653
00:46:19,108 --> 00:46:20,788
There's nothing wrong
in what I asked

654
00:46:20,868 --> 00:46:22,028
Not wrong

655
00:46:22,148 --> 00:46:25,468
But asking me to re-total
Ganapathy's paper is wrong

656
00:46:31,428 --> 00:46:33,748
When will you talk to my parents
about marrying me?

657
00:46:34,428 --> 00:46:36,468
My parents are in Singapore
in my sister's house

658
00:46:36,508 --> 00:46:38,788
They will come back here
only after 3 months, okay?

659
00:46:39,228 --> 00:46:40,868
I can't wait until then

660
00:46:40,908 --> 00:46:43,028
He's threatening me
to give him extra marks

661
00:46:43,068 --> 00:46:44,708
Don't know what
he will demand next!

662
00:46:48,068 --> 00:46:49,828
He won't do anything
You are getting hyper!

663
00:46:49,868 --> 00:46:50,908
Don't get stressed

664
00:46:52,108 --> 00:46:54,148
I knew something
like this would happen!

665
00:46:54,188 --> 00:46:55,828
I can't even sleep in peace

666
00:46:55,908 --> 00:46:57,148
Don't call me, Sridhar

667
00:46:58,388 --> 00:46:59,788
Nandini, listen to me

668
00:47:01,868 --> 00:47:03,148
That's a good decision

669
00:47:03,188 --> 00:47:04,788
I must thank Lakshmi for this

670
00:47:04,828 --> 00:47:06,748
That's why I asked you
to check with your wife

671
00:47:06,788 --> 00:47:08,068
Wife's word is magic

672
00:47:08,108 --> 00:47:09,388
I'm also like that

673
00:47:09,428 --> 00:47:11,948
From now on this school is yours

674
00:47:11,988 --> 00:47:12,788
Give me your hand

675
00:47:21,148 --> 00:47:22,228
Where did you disappear?

676
00:47:22,268 --> 00:47:24,508
Whether the bell rings for break
or not, I got to pee!

677
00:47:25,028 --> 00:47:26,348
Give me your phone

678
00:47:26,388 --> 00:47:27,028
What...?

679
00:47:27,068 --> 00:47:28,468
Can't give you my phone

680
00:47:30,868 --> 00:47:32,588
Why are you torturing me?

681
00:47:45,388 --> 00:47:46,308
Show me

682
00:47:46,388 --> 00:47:48,028
Derive this formula
in 10 minutes

683
00:47:48,228 --> 00:47:49,908
It's on the board

684
00:47:56,148 --> 00:47:58,748
All this while you've been
playing this game

685
00:47:58,788 --> 00:48:01,628
Bring your parents and
then collect your phone

686
00:48:05,228 --> 00:48:07,108
You tackle him
but this is my phone

687
00:48:07,148 --> 00:48:09,108
How dare you snatch
the phone from me?

688
00:48:09,148 --> 00:48:10,108
Give it back

689
00:48:10,508 --> 00:48:11,588
I can't give it

690
00:48:11,628 --> 00:48:13,668
Nitin, better give me the phone

691
00:48:13,708 --> 00:48:15,114
Sir, he was the one
playing the game

692
00:48:15,139 --> 00:48:17,139
Why confiscate my phone?
Punish him if you want

693
00:48:17,164 --> 00:48:19,284
- You first give me the phone
- I can't, sir

694
00:48:19,508 --> 00:48:20,548
Listen to me

695
00:48:20,573 --> 00:48:21,653
How dare you!

696
00:48:21,708 --> 00:48:22,828
Get out of the class

697
00:48:23,748 --> 00:48:25,428
- Get out
- Better return my phone

698
00:48:25,468 --> 00:48:26,908
I know what to do and when

699
00:48:26,948 --> 00:48:28,388
Don't try to hit me

700
00:48:28,468 --> 00:48:30,588
Don't show your arrogance
I'll finish you off!

701
00:48:30,868 --> 00:48:32,668
Go out, I say

702
00:48:33,188 --> 00:48:34,548
Get out

703
00:48:34,708 --> 00:48:35,828
Out...!

704
00:48:36,068 --> 00:48:37,708
Hold this

705
00:48:37,828 --> 00:48:39,868
What's happening?
Let go of him, Sridhar

706
00:48:39,988 --> 00:48:41,708
- Nitin, get up
- Save me, sir

707
00:48:43,708 --> 00:48:45,508
What happened?
Are you alright?

708
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:46,828
Not hurt?

709
00:48:47,028 --> 00:48:48,548
Mr Sridhar, what's this?

710
00:48:48,588 --> 00:48:50,628
Hitting a student like
how you beat up a rowdy

711
00:48:50,668 --> 00:48:52,348
Playing mobile games in class

712
00:48:52,428 --> 00:48:53,668
He raised his hands to hit me

713
00:48:53,708 --> 00:48:55,188
- What, Nitin?
- I wasn't playing, sir

714
00:48:55,213 --> 00:48:56,761
My friend was playing
but he's hitting me

715
00:48:56,786 --> 00:48:58,106
Check with anyone in the class

716
00:48:58,131 --> 00:48:58,891
If you lie-

717
00:48:58,916 --> 00:49:00,236
Mr Sridhar, stop it

718
00:49:01,668 --> 00:49:03,108
Give it to me

719
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:05,228
- Give it to me
- Sir, don't

720
00:49:05,518 --> 00:49:08,398
Here, don't use cell phones
during class hours

721
00:49:08,493 --> 00:49:10,013
Sridhar, please come here

722
00:49:10,099 --> 00:49:12,259
Why are you magnifying small issues?

723
00:49:12,348 --> 00:49:13,628
Do you know who he is?

724
00:49:13,668 --> 00:49:15,988
He's superstar Vijithkanth's only son

725
00:49:16,068 --> 00:49:20,468
If something happens to him,
media will tear our school to pieces

726
00:49:20,508 --> 00:49:23,268
- Should I tolerate his impudence?
- You have no choice

727
00:49:23,308 --> 00:49:26,108
We should be proud
he is studying in our school

728
00:49:26,188 --> 00:49:28,388
Try to understand
Go, continue with your class

729
00:49:30,908 --> 00:49:33,108
He's himself behaving like a student

730
00:49:33,148 --> 00:49:34,068
Give it to me

731
00:49:34,148 --> 00:49:36,428
Playing games in the class
is wrong whoever it may be

732
00:49:45,308 --> 00:49:46,268
Can I come in?

733
00:49:47,668 --> 00:49:50,388
Swapna's father met with
an accident and is serious

734
00:49:52,348 --> 00:49:53,948
Did her dad meet with an accident?

735
00:49:53,988 --> 00:49:56,428
I believe your dad met
with an accident, hurry up

736
00:49:57,388 --> 00:49:59,148
- What happened to my dad?
- Auto accident

737
00:49:59,173 --> 00:50:00,773
- How...where?
- Near the market

738
00:50:00,798 --> 00:50:02,478
- Market...?
- Moore market

739
00:50:02,503 --> 00:50:03,463
That is-

740
00:50:03,588 --> 00:50:04,548
Where is it?

741
00:50:04,830 --> 00:50:06,550
- Tell me
- It's in Central

742
00:50:06,575 --> 00:50:07,455
Did you see it?

743
00:50:07,637 --> 00:50:09,837
I was the one who admitted
your father in the hospital

744
00:50:09,948 --> 00:50:12,028
- Which hospital?
- Stanley

745
00:50:12,302 --> 00:50:14,742
It's 3 months since
my dad went to Banglore

746
00:50:14,951 --> 00:50:18,551
Then could it be
your father's father?

747
00:50:18,584 --> 00:50:21,904
- By the way, who are you?
- Don't you remember me, Swapna?

748
00:50:22,108 --> 00:50:24,068
I'm in love with you
for the past 6 years

749
00:50:32,934 --> 00:50:34,574
- Who is he?
- Hit him

750
00:50:34,708 --> 00:50:37,548
If I love my Swapna,
why should it hurt you?

751
00:50:37,588 --> 00:50:38,508
Steamed cake!

752
00:50:38,548 --> 00:50:40,788
If you give her a love letter
will we keep quiet?

753
00:50:40,828 --> 00:50:42,548
I've styled my hair
into spikes for her sake

754
00:50:42,588 --> 00:50:45,388
- Does this pot-face need spikes?
- Don't touch my head

755
00:50:45,788 --> 00:50:47,548
Hit him

756
00:50:47,668 --> 00:50:49,268
Bash his face
Knock his head

757
00:50:49,348 --> 00:50:50,668
He's trying to get away

758
00:50:51,988 --> 00:50:53,508
Cream steamed cake!

759
00:50:53,628 --> 00:50:56,188
You beat me in front of
my girl friend, right?

760
00:50:56,228 --> 00:50:58,428
I'll bring my boys
and finish you off

761
00:50:58,468 --> 00:51:00,748
Will you do it?
Bring whomever you want

762
00:51:00,828 --> 00:51:01,948
I'll wait for you here

763
00:51:01,988 --> 00:51:03,468
- You broke my nose
- Go...go

764
00:51:07,988 --> 00:51:09,388
You are dead meat, man!

765
00:51:18,748 --> 00:51:20,788
Check if your name,
your father's name...

766
00:51:20,908 --> 00:51:23,108
...and date of birth
have been written correctly

767
00:51:23,268 --> 00:51:25,828
Only these details will be
printed in all your certificates

768
00:51:42,397 --> 00:51:44,437
Hey! Yesterday was your birthday?

769
00:51:44,588 --> 00:51:45,628
Yes, ma'am

770
00:51:45,708 --> 00:51:47,308
You didn't give sweets to any of us?

771
00:51:47,348 --> 00:51:50,948
Yesterday was Sunday, so I just
celebrated with my friends, ma'am

772
00:51:50,988 --> 00:51:52,228
I'll give you tomorrow

773
00:52:01,108 --> 00:52:03,548
'A hug from you
is the biggest gift ever'

774
00:52:16,468 --> 00:52:17,308
What do you want?

775
00:52:17,388 --> 00:52:18,228
For you...?

776
00:52:18,268 --> 00:52:19,508
No pizza

777
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:14,148
Whatever I've been seeing
all along isn't new at all

778
00:53:14,771 --> 00:53:16,348
The way she looked at me today...

779
00:53:16,388 --> 00:53:17,668
...totally out of this world!

780
00:53:17,708 --> 00:53:24,508
"As tiny as a mustard seed
love in your eyes I can see"

781
00:53:24,708 --> 00:53:31,668
"All over my heart and body I can see
your teasing glances play softly"

782
00:53:31,748 --> 00:53:38,588
"Without realizing, unknowingly
I lost myself in you slowly"

783
00:54:24,828 --> 00:54:31,188
"You threw a pebble into the pond
You created ripples in my heart to bond"

784
00:54:31,428 --> 00:54:37,908
"Wanting to walk away from me
you came closer bashfully"

785
00:54:37,988 --> 00:54:46,988
"I thought of you in earnest
for the first time as my address"

786
00:54:49,508 --> 00:54:52,828
"The best decision that made sense"

787
00:54:52,868 --> 00:54:56,468
"Will your dress tease me gladly?
Will your breath caress gently?"

788
00:54:56,508 --> 00:55:00,028
"Will fingers graze invitingly?
And toe-nails play footsie?"

789
00:55:00,108 --> 00:55:03,468
"No 'kumkum', jasmine, silken finery"

790
00:55:03,508 --> 00:55:06,828
"You stand before me simply
Nothing compares to you truly"

791
00:55:06,948 --> 00:55:14,148
"As tiny as a mustard seed
love in your eyes I can see"

792
00:55:14,308 --> 00:55:21,068
"All over my heart and body I can see
your impish glances swirl enticingly"

793
00:55:49,868 --> 00:55:56,668
"Girl, if you stand dressed gorgeously
my thoughts lose their hold on celibacy"

794
00:55:56,868 --> 00:56:02,908
"Even when you ignored me, darling
your eyes gave away your feeling"

795
00:56:03,028 --> 00:56:09,748
"You on one side, me on the other"

796
00:56:10,108 --> 00:56:13,708
"Who steps in as the intruder?"

797
00:56:14,628 --> 00:56:17,908
"Shyness is the gate-crasher"

798
00:56:17,948 --> 00:56:21,508
"Wherever I may go
Or be on my own"

799
00:56:21,588 --> 00:56:25,108
"You followed me faithfully
Why leave me wordlessly?"

800
00:56:25,188 --> 00:56:30,108
"Like Stone age inscriptions true
if you uttered one word on cue"

801
00:56:30,188 --> 00:56:31,908
"Won't that do?"

802
00:56:31,948 --> 00:56:39,188
"As tiny as a mustard seed
love in your eyes I can see"

803
00:56:39,268 --> 00:56:46,188
"All over my heart and body I can see
your naughtiness slide seductively"

804
00:56:46,308 --> 00:56:53,908
"Without realizing, unknowingly
I lost myself in you slowly"

805
00:57:21,988 --> 00:57:23,348
'My dream of 2 years'

806
00:57:23,428 --> 00:57:26,668
'I submitted my thesis
'Life on Mars' today'

807
00:57:26,723 --> 00:57:32,723
UNESCO has appreciated
the thesis Shiva submitted

808
00:57:32,763 --> 00:57:37,283
This is a jewel in the crown
of all our schools indeed

809
00:57:40,403 --> 00:57:42,563
Another piece of good news

810
00:57:42,603 --> 00:57:45,163
To elevate the standard of
our school even more...

811
00:57:45,203 --> 00:57:47,443
...to get the ISO seal of approval

812
00:57:47,483 --> 00:57:51,883
...an inspection will be conducted
in our premises next Monday

813
00:57:53,523 --> 00:58:00,483
Shiva, shouldn't you safeguard
your hard work for 2 years?

814
00:58:00,523 --> 00:58:02,163
If it is in the Science lab...

815
00:58:02,203 --> 00:58:05,163
...anyone who doesn't like you
may tamper with it, my dear boy

816
00:58:29,723 --> 00:58:31,523
Oh gawd!
My thesis!

817
00:59:00,523 --> 00:59:02,003
What are you doing?

818
00:59:04,363 --> 00:59:06,363
Anthony sir, do something

819
00:59:19,203 --> 00:59:20,323
Wait

820
00:59:25,483 --> 00:59:26,963
Come...come

821
00:59:57,363 --> 00:59:59,243
Try me...hit me

822
01:00:05,203 --> 01:00:07,803
Your dream of 2 years
Dissolved, huh?

823
01:00:11,644 --> 01:00:13,284
You burnt it, right?

824
01:00:13,363 --> 01:00:15,003
YOU BURNT IT, RIGHT?

825
01:00:15,483 --> 01:00:16,923
You're dead meat, man

826
01:00:21,363 --> 01:00:23,083
Don't mess with me

827
01:00:28,843 --> 01:00:32,323
Why did you burn
my Physics paper?

828
01:00:37,883 --> 01:00:39,883
Go to hell!

829
01:01:09,083 --> 01:01:10,363
Don't run

830
01:01:21,723 --> 01:01:22,963
Shiva, get up

831
01:01:24,763 --> 01:01:26,323
Let go of me, sir

832
01:01:26,443 --> 01:01:27,923
Just let me go

833
01:01:28,003 --> 01:01:29,643
Why are you behaving like a rowdy?

834
01:01:29,683 --> 01:01:30,763
He burnt my thesis

835
01:01:30,803 --> 01:01:32,683
Did you see him burn it?

836
01:01:32,723 --> 01:01:34,068
He was the one who told me

837
01:01:34,093 --> 01:01:36,213
How will I burn the papers
and go confess to him?

838
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:37,920
Don't mince words

839
01:01:39,163 --> 01:01:42,883
This school's atmosphere has
changed because of your fight

840
01:01:42,963 --> 01:01:44,483
Tomorrow when you come to school...

841
01:01:44,523 --> 01:01:45,803
...bring your parents along

842
01:01:46,763 --> 01:01:47,883
Come with your parents

843
01:01:47,923 --> 01:01:49,163
Why should I bring my parents?

844
01:01:49,203 --> 01:01:50,792
If you're playing fair,
you should expel him

845
01:01:50,963 --> 01:01:53,083
Tell me the damage
I'll pay it in one shot

846
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:55,203
Don't let your tongue run

847
01:01:55,243 --> 01:01:56,603
You don't dictate terms here

848
01:01:56,643 --> 01:01:58,723
Okay, don't believe me
Ask Nandini ma'am

849
01:01:58,763 --> 01:02:00,563
She'll vouch for his misconduct

850
01:02:02,243 --> 01:02:03,763
Do you agree with Nitin?

851
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:04,723
Tell us the truth

852
01:02:04,763 --> 01:02:05,643
I think-

853
01:02:05,683 --> 01:02:06,763
Be honest

854
01:02:07,003 --> 01:02:07,963
Yes, sir

855
01:02:08,003 --> 01:02:09,523
Now do you believe me?

856
01:02:10,618 --> 01:02:13,378
Shiva, because you are
an outstanding student...

857
01:02:13,403 --> 01:02:14,963
...we pampered you
with concessions

858
01:02:15,003 --> 01:02:17,563
All the teachers are
complaining about you

859
01:02:20,683 --> 01:02:23,363
That was my speech to
an international audience

860
01:02:23,403 --> 01:02:25,323
Now the papers have been
burnt to ashes, sir

861
01:02:25,363 --> 01:02:26,643
So tell me, how will I go, sir?

862
01:02:26,683 --> 01:02:29,643
Papers can be prepared again

863
01:02:29,723 --> 01:02:32,123
But that doesn't justify
your violent action

864
01:02:33,483 --> 01:02:35,003
You call him innocent?

865
01:02:38,043 --> 01:02:39,363
You might not be in the wrong

866
01:02:39,403 --> 01:02:42,683
But our school has a certain discipline
to follow, you shouldn't cross that limit

867
01:02:42,723 --> 01:02:45,563
If you misbehave again
I'll inform your father

868
01:02:45,898 --> 01:02:47,378
I don't listen to my dad

869
01:02:47,403 --> 01:02:49,843
Give me a Transfer Certificate
I'll join in some other school

870
01:02:49,883 --> 01:02:52,483
Look at his temerity!
He is by no means innocent

871
01:02:52,523 --> 01:02:53,363
Keep quiet

872
01:02:53,403 --> 01:02:54,923
I don't want 101 different opinions

873
01:02:54,963 --> 01:02:57,243
Disperse...stop crowding here

874
01:02:57,483 --> 01:02:58,203
Move

875
01:03:04,883 --> 01:03:06,763
Nandini, listen to me

876
01:03:09,306 --> 01:03:10,706
Why are you over reacting?

877
01:03:10,763 --> 01:03:11,763
Don't touch me

878
01:03:13,283 --> 01:03:14,043
Don't touch me

879
01:03:14,083 --> 01:03:15,683
You're walking away
ignoring me coolly

880
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:16,828
This isn't enough for you?

881
01:03:16,923 --> 01:03:18,283
Just because he has our video...

882
01:03:18,323 --> 01:03:20,083
...he's blackmailing us
in front of everyone

883
01:03:20,163 --> 01:03:22,203
You keep following me
like a lost pup

884
01:03:22,243 --> 01:03:23,403
He's a pipsqueak

885
01:03:23,443 --> 01:03:25,083
Why do you
let him get to you?

886
01:03:25,643 --> 01:03:26,883
You think he's a kid

887
01:03:26,923 --> 01:03:28,163
He knows everything

888
01:03:28,203 --> 01:03:31,683
If that video ever leaks
and I lose my self respect...

889
01:03:32,083 --> 01:03:33,683
...I'll die

890
01:03:35,403 --> 01:03:36,243
Let go of me

891
01:03:36,283 --> 01:03:37,523
Where are you going?

892
01:03:51,243 --> 01:03:52,723
Getting late
No sign of madam

893
01:03:52,763 --> 01:03:53,403
On her way

894
01:03:53,443 --> 01:03:55,243
Lord Muruga,
no hitches please

895
01:03:56,363 --> 01:03:57,603
Plant them with enough gap

896
01:03:57,643 --> 01:03:59,923
Indu, why did you
bring this plant?

897
01:04:00,683 --> 01:04:02,483
Don't waste the saplings

898
01:04:02,523 --> 01:04:04,123
You'll be marked for this

899
01:04:04,523 --> 01:04:06,163
Take that plant

900
01:04:07,123 --> 01:04:08,563
Have you prepared the girls?

901
01:04:08,603 --> 01:04:11,003
Girls, as soon as madam arrives...

902
01:04:11,043 --> 01:04:13,963
...present her this bouquet
and say, 'Welcome, madam'

903
01:04:14,003 --> 01:04:15,003
Understood?

904
01:04:16,363 --> 01:04:17,323
Don't get tense

905
01:04:17,403 --> 01:04:19,563
Lord Muruga, help me

906
01:04:19,603 --> 01:04:21,843
You can plan later
Plant now

907
01:04:21,883 --> 01:04:22,483
Sit

908
01:04:22,523 --> 01:04:23,443
On your haunches

909
01:04:23,483 --> 01:04:25,163
Or else you'll fail
in the practical exam

910
01:04:25,203 --> 01:04:26,043
I need to pee, sir

911
01:04:26,603 --> 01:04:28,163
- Don't act
- Urgent, sir

912
01:04:51,283 --> 01:04:54,003
Nitin has poured ink
all over your notes

913
01:04:54,043 --> 01:04:56,363
He is throwing all your
books to the ground

914
01:04:56,403 --> 01:04:57,363
What are you saying?

915
01:04:57,403 --> 01:04:58,723
I swear, I saw him

916
01:04:58,763 --> 01:05:00,083
Go and see for yourself

917
01:05:09,851 --> 01:05:12,531
This boy is studying here?

918
01:05:12,603 --> 01:05:13,963
He is Shiva

919
01:05:14,043 --> 01:05:16,483
Clicked when he stood 1st
in the State in 10th grade

920
01:05:16,523 --> 01:05:19,683
We are sure he will do us proud
in the 12th grade exam too

921
01:05:19,723 --> 01:05:20,683
Am I right, teacher?

922
01:05:20,803 --> 01:05:22,843
Go and call Shiva right away

923
01:05:28,058 --> 01:05:29,738
Why disturb the student?

924
01:05:29,763 --> 01:05:31,523
We can go to his class

925
01:06:34,261 --> 01:06:35,741
I didn't do it, Maya

926
01:06:37,061 --> 01:06:39,421
He was already dead
when I came here

927
01:06:44,381 --> 01:06:45,781
Please trust me

928
01:07:01,181 --> 01:07:04,461
This is Rangasamy, Chairman
of Alamelu group of institutions

929
01:07:04,501 --> 01:07:05,981
Tell me, bro

930
01:07:06,135 --> 01:07:08,421
Are you negotiating
with my school teacher?

931
01:07:08,461 --> 01:07:11,901
- Please listen to me
- No, I don't need any explanation

932
01:07:11,981 --> 01:07:14,021
You've entered
this game recently

933
01:07:14,061 --> 01:07:16,221
We've been running
schools for many years

934
01:07:16,221 --> 01:07:18,341
This is business
You'll have profit and loss

935
01:07:18,421 --> 01:07:20,221
I'm not in this to do service!

936
01:07:20,261 --> 01:07:22,941
2 State Govt schools
don't function the same way

937
01:07:22,981 --> 01:07:25,421
Then how can you and I
run schools the same way?

938
01:07:25,461 --> 01:07:28,421
I know why you are dying
to get ISO certificate

939
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:29,541
Yov! What will you do?

940
01:07:29,581 --> 01:07:32,421
I'll take care of shutting down
your entire institution

941
01:07:32,461 --> 01:07:34,261
You can do any damn thing you want

942
01:07:34,301 --> 01:07:35,381
I'll show you

943
01:07:35,421 --> 01:07:37,021
I will do the needful myself

944
01:07:38,501 --> 01:07:40,181
Strike with more force

945
01:07:40,581 --> 01:07:43,541
- Need to go to the loo urgently
- No, do your work

946
01:07:43,581 --> 01:07:45,341
- Just once, sir
- Focus on your work

947
01:07:47,541 --> 01:07:48,781
Hey! Dumbass, look at this

948
01:07:48,821 --> 01:07:51,021
Getting into the school seems tricky

949
01:07:51,101 --> 01:07:53,821
Boss, you've seen worst prisons

950
01:07:53,861 --> 01:07:56,301
This is such a small school
Why should you crib?

951
01:07:56,341 --> 01:07:59,061
We can carry out your plan
when he is out somewhere?

952
01:07:59,141 --> 01:08:00,661
You're with us all the time

953
01:08:00,701 --> 01:08:03,821
Only the stinking rich can
go to his regular hangouts

954
01:08:03,861 --> 01:08:04,501
Come

955
01:08:04,541 --> 01:08:06,541
Why are you patiently
explaining to him?

956
01:08:06,581 --> 01:08:09,421
Whatever happens, we must
close his chapter today

957
01:08:09,461 --> 01:08:11,341
In front of my dream girl...

958
01:08:11,381 --> 01:08:13,341
...these young boys-
- Don't get tense

959
01:08:13,341 --> 01:08:14,861
...whacked me on my head

960
01:08:14,901 --> 01:08:17,141
I'm here for you now?
I will finish him off

961
01:08:19,701 --> 01:08:21,061
This place is so huuuge!

962
01:08:21,141 --> 01:08:23,181
I told you right then, boss

963
01:08:24,716 --> 01:08:26,916
- Hey! Come this way
- What happened, boss?

964
01:08:26,941 --> 01:08:29,741
- Where are we going, boss?
- Someone is coming

965
01:08:29,941 --> 01:08:31,261
Das, stand in line

966
01:08:31,341 --> 01:08:32,461
Who is that?

967
01:08:33,981 --> 01:08:35,781
Don't bug me
Come this side

968
01:08:38,741 --> 01:08:41,941
Our school is #1 in Chennai

969
01:08:41,981 --> 01:08:47,621
If their kids study here,
parents think of it as a social status

970
01:08:47,661 --> 01:08:49,941
But how many students
can we admit?

971
01:08:50,021 --> 01:08:53,341
Now you will also be
giving us ISO certificate

972
01:08:53,501 --> 01:08:58,101
I'm so excited about
our school's elevated status

973
01:09:13,701 --> 01:09:15,621
What is this room?

974
01:09:15,661 --> 01:09:18,141
Looks like a police station!

975
01:09:22,261 --> 01:09:23,781
I got an idea

976
01:09:30,661 --> 01:09:33,581
The total area of
this school is 20 acres

977
01:09:33,661 --> 01:09:35,061
400 classrooms

978
01:09:35,181 --> 01:09:37,141
10,000 students

979
01:09:37,221 --> 01:09:41,941
We've constructed a swimming pool and
a playground on international standards

980
01:09:42,021 --> 01:09:44,501
If you want to take a tour
of our entire premises...

981
01:09:44,541 --> 01:09:46,221
...it will take minimum 2 days

982
01:09:46,806 --> 01:09:48,846
Why should we waste
2 days unnecessarily?

983
01:09:48,941 --> 01:09:51,221
You're hinting I should
sign and leave at once

984
01:09:54,741 --> 01:09:57,621
Mr Sudandhiram, just listing out
all the amenities won't do

985
01:09:57,661 --> 01:10:00,141
We must check if those
facilities reach the students

986
01:10:00,181 --> 01:10:02,061
That's the reason
for this Inspection

987
01:10:03,581 --> 01:10:06,581
They have spent a king's ransom
and made a palatial school!

988
01:10:13,461 --> 01:10:15,661
Madam, he's Mr Anthony Gonzales

989
01:10:15,701 --> 01:10:18,701
At M.I.T he was the head
the computer science department

990
01:10:21,461 --> 01:10:23,141
Not used to shaking hand-

991
01:10:42,261 --> 01:10:44,421
He was already dead
when I walked in

992
01:10:46,381 --> 01:10:47,661
Believe me, Maya

993
01:10:51,301 --> 01:10:52,741
Maya-

994
01:10:57,261 --> 01:10:58,941
Maya, I didn't do anything

995
01:10:59,021 --> 01:11:00,021
I didn't kill him

996
01:11:00,061 --> 01:11:01,261
Trust me, please

997
01:11:01,301 --> 01:11:02,781
Look at me, Maya

998
01:11:08,661 --> 01:11:10,061
I don't like him, I agree

999
01:11:10,101 --> 01:11:11,461
We are sworn enemies

1000
01:11:11,501 --> 01:11:13,461
But I swear I didn't
murder him, Maya

1001
01:11:13,501 --> 01:11:15,141
Believe me, please

1002
01:11:17,781 --> 01:11:21,781
If you look at the aerial view
of this school, it's so beauuutiful!

1003
01:11:21,861 --> 01:11:24,141
Have I come to buy
this school, Mr Sudhakar?

1004
01:11:25,941 --> 01:11:27,861
Why are you wasting time, Maya?

1005
01:11:46,781 --> 01:11:48,381
You've only killed him, Shiva

1006
01:11:48,421 --> 01:11:49,981
I didn't do it

1007
01:11:50,021 --> 01:11:51,901
No one other than me
will believe you

1008
01:11:51,901 --> 01:11:54,501
As far as everyone is concerned
you are the killer

1009
01:11:58,276 --> 01:12:01,316
The whole school knows about
your 'friendship' with Nitin

1010
01:12:01,341 --> 01:12:03,981
We all saw you both
hitting each other 4 days ago

1011
01:12:04,021 --> 01:12:05,701
So they will say
you killed him

1012
01:12:05,741 --> 01:12:07,901
- Nobody will say that
- Of course they will

1013
01:12:07,981 --> 01:12:10,981
Because you've rolled
over him after he died

1014
01:12:11,849 --> 01:12:14,769
Entire class has only your
finger prints and foot prints

1015
01:12:15,501 --> 01:12:17,621
Only 10 minutes
since the break-bell rang

1016
01:12:17,661 --> 01:12:19,861
The killer has to be
inside the school campus

1017
01:12:19,941 --> 01:12:22,581
It isn't too late, we can still
find the killer easily, Shiva

1018
01:12:22,621 --> 01:12:25,061
Think you're Kamal
in 'Vettaiyaadu Vilaiyaadu'

1019
01:12:25,141 --> 01:12:27,581
It isn't easy to find the murderer

1020
01:12:31,061 --> 01:12:32,941
What Maya's instinct says is...

1021
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:36,501
You'll be in jail
for having killed Nitin

1022
01:12:36,781 --> 01:12:38,301
I'll be visiting you there!

1023
01:12:41,981 --> 01:12:44,581
They have installed cameras
in every nook and corner

1024
01:12:44,621 --> 01:12:47,981
People who've entered our campus
have struggled to exit for 2 days!

1025
01:12:52,181 --> 01:12:53,901
Aiyo! Egg

1026
01:12:55,541 --> 01:12:57,261
Somehow go and manage, sir

1027
01:12:57,461 --> 01:12:59,061
What is happening here?

1028
01:12:59,701 --> 01:13:01,781
How can they be
sitting here and eating?

1029
01:13:01,821 --> 01:13:03,221
The egg is from our canteen

1030
01:13:06,381 --> 01:13:09,901
When it comes to food,
we don't control our students

1031
01:13:10,599 --> 01:13:13,199
In fact you should try
the egg in our canteen

1032
01:13:14,581 --> 01:13:16,341
Very true
Straight from Namakkal

1033
01:13:16,941 --> 01:13:19,301
Shall I send you a load, madam?

1034
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:25,830
Whatever!
Let's go to the canteen

1035
01:13:25,855 --> 01:13:27,701
Madam, let's meet Shiva first

1036
01:13:27,741 --> 01:13:30,221
Shiva is a student here
Will he disappear somewhere?!

1037
01:13:30,261 --> 01:13:31,101
He won't

1038
01:13:34,086 --> 01:13:36,156
In case the killer
has left the campus...

1039
01:13:36,181 --> 01:13:37,501
...how can we find him?

1040
01:13:37,581 --> 01:13:39,421
No way!
He has to be here

1041
01:13:43,341 --> 01:13:45,501
At 11:30 Nitin was alive

1042
01:13:45,781 --> 01:13:47,101
The time now is...

1043
01:13:50,021 --> 01:13:52,181
You came in here
only at 11:38

1044
01:13:52,499 --> 01:13:56,059
So the murder has taken place
only in this time frame of 8 minutes

1045
01:13:57,381 --> 01:14:01,141
That too it must have happened
only after our break for sure

1046
01:14:02,661 --> 01:14:04,341
Greetings, bro

1047
01:14:11,461 --> 01:14:13,141
Main gate is here

1048
01:14:14,621 --> 01:14:17,141
Our class is in D block, 3rd floor

1049
01:14:18,141 --> 01:14:21,661
From the classroom to main gate
it will take at least 15 minutes

1050
01:14:21,701 --> 01:14:23,421
Even if you run,
10 minutes

1051
01:14:24,421 --> 01:14:25,501
Not only that

1052
01:14:25,541 --> 01:14:27,621
Because of the ISO inspection today...

1053
01:14:27,661 --> 01:14:29,341
...main gate will be closed

1054
01:14:29,381 --> 01:14:31,141
No one could have
left the campus

1055
01:14:31,141 --> 01:14:33,301
If he had jumped
over the compound wall?

1056
01:14:33,941 --> 01:14:36,221
He couldn't have gone
without crossing us

1057
01:14:37,381 --> 01:14:39,861
The killer won't step out
with blood stains

1058
01:14:39,941 --> 01:14:43,463
So the killer has to be
inside the campus definitely

1059
01:14:43,538 --> 01:14:46,138
Hey! How long will you take
to pick up the phone?

1060
01:14:46,303 --> 01:14:47,303
Where did you go?

1061
01:14:47,454 --> 01:14:50,814
According to your deduction
there are students, teachers, staff...

1062
01:14:50,901 --> 01:14:53,061
...around 4000 people
in the campus now

1063
01:14:53,061 --> 01:14:55,061
How can we find the killer
in this crowd?

1064
01:14:55,101 --> 01:14:57,501
For a single person
to finish off Nitin...

1065
01:14:57,541 --> 01:15:01,061
...he should be at least
5'10'' tall and weigh 80 kgs

1066
01:15:06,101 --> 01:15:10,381
If you reject the teachers, staff,
ladies and old people among the rest...

1067
01:15:10,468 --> 01:15:13,876
...from these 30 or 40 people
1 chap must have killed Nitin

1068
01:15:13,901 --> 01:15:16,061
Even an outsider could
have killed him, right?

1069
01:15:16,086 --> 01:15:17,376
Then he would've killed him outside

1070
01:15:17,401 --> 01:15:18,761
Not with so many restrictions

1071
01:15:19,148 --> 01:15:19,948
Let's go

1072
01:15:26,381 --> 01:15:29,261
You rattled about eggs and
tried to serve me one, right?

1073
01:15:39,616 --> 01:15:41,776
The killer must be
well known to Nitin

1074
01:15:41,826 --> 01:15:43,626
Why should a known person kill him?

1075
01:15:43,737 --> 01:15:46,537
He could have befriended him
just to take revenge, right?

1076
01:15:46,686 --> 01:15:48,399
But he didn't murder him for money

1077
01:15:48,585 --> 01:15:51,105
Look, his gold chain and
Rolex watch are untouched

1078
01:15:51,270 --> 01:15:53,670
So the killer needed
something else from Nitin

1079
01:15:54,021 --> 01:15:55,181
What else-

1080
01:15:57,191 --> 01:15:59,391
Why should the killer
be just 1 person?

1081
01:15:59,981 --> 01:16:01,781
2 people could be involved

1082
01:16:03,311 --> 01:16:04,591
You'll get 100 questions

1083
01:16:04,741 --> 01:16:07,141
In the given time all we
need is just 1 answer

1084
01:16:11,781 --> 01:16:13,121
I've just come out of prison

1085
01:16:13,146 --> 01:16:14,866
If you push me back in...

1086
01:16:14,903 --> 01:16:15,903
...I'll finish you off

1087
01:16:15,928 --> 01:16:16,848
Let's clear out

1088
01:16:16,981 --> 01:16:20,181
You call yourself a thug!
Imagine being scared of him

1089
01:16:20,261 --> 01:16:21,261
Is that so?

1090
01:16:21,301 --> 01:16:22,981
Maintain the same swagger

1091
01:16:26,679 --> 01:16:28,279
'Jai Hind!'

1092
01:16:28,485 --> 01:16:29,885
'Long live India'

1093
01:16:30,061 --> 01:16:32,701
'This doesn't look like
the original salutation party!'

1094
01:16:32,905 --> 01:16:34,865
'They look like impostors'

1095
01:16:36,101 --> 01:16:37,701
We should go
to the admin block

1096
01:16:37,726 --> 01:16:40,701
Find the list of the 40 people
we are looking for

1097
01:16:40,741 --> 01:16:41,821
And short list them

1098
01:16:42,901 --> 01:16:45,581
If I come like this, like you
people will call me a murderer

1099
01:16:45,621 --> 01:16:46,941
You've also started to think!

1100
01:16:46,981 --> 01:16:48,101
My t-shirt is in my bag

1101
01:16:48,141 --> 01:16:49,661
Get it for me
I'll change here

1102
01:16:57,581 --> 01:16:59,301
Maya...Maya...hurry up

1103
01:17:13,821 --> 01:17:17,701
'When no one else was aware
you entered my life to love and care'

1104
01:17:26,501 --> 01:17:29,141
What if someone comes here
after we leave this room?

1105
01:17:29,141 --> 01:17:31,261
Turn on the projector
Increase the volume

1106
01:17:31,301 --> 01:17:33,421
Only then no one will enter

1107
01:17:50,741 --> 01:17:52,741
Why are the students teaching?

1108
01:17:52,781 --> 01:17:54,901
- Where is the teacher?
- He is right here

1109
01:17:55,021 --> 01:18:00,021
This is the best Biology teacher
in our school, Mr K.Sunderarajan

1110
01:18:00,261 --> 01:18:01,341
Good morning

1111
01:18:01,541 --> 01:18:04,301
Is there a shortage of
teachers for the 10th grade?

1112
01:18:04,901 --> 01:18:08,301
Actually to make students
gain self confidence...

1113
01:18:08,341 --> 01:18:10,061
...it is his friendly approach

1114
01:18:10,141 --> 01:18:11,701
I completely approve

1115
01:18:11,741 --> 01:18:13,021
My hand is bloodstained

1116
01:18:14,821 --> 01:18:16,821
Good morning, sir
What do you want?

1117
01:18:17,015 --> 01:18:19,255
Who is Gonzalves here?

1118
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:21,240
There is an inspection
in school today, sir

1119
01:18:21,303 --> 01:18:23,463
So you can find him
in the 3rd block

1120
01:18:23,621 --> 01:18:24,461
This side?

1121
01:18:24,501 --> 01:18:27,621
Go straight and turn right
If you cross that bridge it's 3rd block

1122
01:18:31,021 --> 01:18:32,661
Quick, someone might see us

1123
01:18:34,345 --> 01:18:35,545
Keep going
I'll catch up

1124
01:18:36,623 --> 01:18:37,583
Go...!

1125
01:18:37,861 --> 01:18:39,781
- Hey! Come in, fast
- What happened?

1126
01:18:58,501 --> 01:19:00,381
He has only killed Nitin

1127
01:19:03,981 --> 01:19:05,141
Let's follow him

1128
01:19:05,821 --> 01:19:06,821
Follow me

1129
01:19:55,061 --> 01:19:57,501
I think he plans to
bury Nitin's body here

1130
01:19:58,181 --> 01:19:59,901
We must catch him red handed

1131
01:20:03,581 --> 01:20:05,581
Only then we can prove
he's the killer

1132
01:20:12,781 --> 01:20:15,981
I didn't think it would be
this easy to track down the killer

1133
01:20:17,101 --> 01:20:19,701
Hey! He'll bury him now
Let's go and get him

1134
01:20:24,101 --> 01:20:25,661
Selvam anna

1135
01:20:26,221 --> 01:20:28,181
Shiva, what are you both doing here?

1136
01:20:28,221 --> 01:20:29,061
Go to your class

1137
01:20:29,061 --> 01:20:30,781
You think you can
hide everything?

1138
01:20:30,861 --> 01:20:33,141
Maya, go and bring everyone
I'll take care of him

1139
01:20:33,181 --> 01:20:34,381
You won't understand

1140
01:20:34,421 --> 01:20:35,981
I've done this for
everyone's good

1141
01:20:36,021 --> 01:20:36,741
Who will benefit?

1142
01:20:36,781 --> 01:20:38,381
No one can escape
after a murder

1143
01:20:38,381 --> 01:20:41,861
Do you know, our school's honor would
have gone for a toss if I hadn't killed?

1144
01:20:41,901 --> 01:20:43,981
You stay here
I'll get the Principal

1145
01:20:44,021 --> 01:20:45,981
He will praise me
sky high if he gets to know

1146
01:20:46,021 --> 01:20:47,181
What are you blabbering?

1147
01:20:47,221 --> 01:20:48,221
I'm not blabbering

1148
01:20:48,261 --> 01:20:49,701
I hadn't killed this pig today...

1149
01:20:49,741 --> 01:20:51,621
...today's Inspection
would've been a disaster!

1150
01:20:57,461 --> 01:21:00,021
Don't report this
to the Blue Cross

1151
01:21:00,061 --> 01:21:01,101
I'll lose my job

1152
01:21:01,141 --> 01:21:02,941
- Have mercy on me
- What do we do?

1153
01:21:02,981 --> 01:21:04,221
Guys, I need a small help

1154
01:21:04,261 --> 01:21:05,198
Where is 12th grade?

1155
01:21:05,223 --> 01:21:06,463
- 12th...?
- Yes

1156
01:21:06,565 --> 01:21:08,525
- For what?
- They've ordered a pizza

1157
01:21:09,341 --> 01:21:10,981
If you like, we can
deliver it for you

1158
01:21:11,021 --> 01:21:12,581
- Will you deliver?
- Sure

1159
01:21:12,621 --> 01:21:13,821
We are also in 12th!

1160
01:21:15,461 --> 01:21:16,981
- Is it chicken?
- Yes, boss

1161
01:21:18,941 --> 01:21:20,061
Here it is

1162
01:21:20,141 --> 01:21:21,741
- What's this?
- Bill

1163
01:21:21,781 --> 01:21:22,951
How much?

1164
01:21:22,976 --> 01:21:24,496
- What...?
- 1200

1165
01:21:24,661 --> 01:21:26,541
Even a bag of rice
costs only 1000 bucks!

1166
01:21:26,581 --> 01:21:27,459
Daylight robbery!

1167
01:21:27,484 --> 01:21:29,164
Boss, have you ever
had pizza before?

1168
01:21:29,421 --> 01:21:30,861
Which 12th grade
did you ask for?

1169
01:21:30,901 --> 01:21:32,781
There can only be
one 12th grade, right?

1170
01:21:32,821 --> 01:21:34,501
Hold this, we are in 8th grade

1171
01:21:35,861 --> 01:21:37,101
See how well I tackled him

1172
01:21:37,141 --> 01:21:39,501
Even if you said 6th grade
he would’ve believed you

1173
01:21:41,345 --> 01:21:42,945
Shiva, wait a moment please

1174
01:21:43,065 --> 01:21:44,065
What now, Maya?

1175
01:21:44,241 --> 01:21:46,785
We must go to Admin block
and short list those 40 people

1176
01:21:46,825 --> 01:21:49,625
Already we wasted too much time
following that driver, Maya

1177
01:21:49,665 --> 01:21:50,785
If we are too anxious...

1178
01:21:50,825 --> 01:21:53,745
...even if the real killer comes
in front of us we won't identify him!

1179
01:21:53,785 --> 01:21:55,471
We have to go
back to our class now

1180
01:21:55,496 --> 01:21:56,856
Again...why?

1181
01:21:58,105 --> 01:22:01,065
The killer would've left
some clue at the crime spot

1182
01:22:10,425 --> 01:22:11,625
Quick!

1183
01:22:14,825 --> 01:22:16,865
You go and look
over there for any clues

1184
01:22:22,145 --> 01:22:23,985
Let's search in
the admin block

1185
01:22:24,025 --> 01:22:25,345
Let's look here first

1186
01:22:30,105 --> 01:22:32,945
Nitin's bag has only books
and laptop charger, Maya

1187
01:22:32,985 --> 01:22:34,505
There's nothing
in his desk either

1188
01:22:34,545 --> 01:22:36,825
Search thoroughly
We'll find a clue

1189
01:22:43,381 --> 01:22:46,181
'Why did the killer use
a pencil as his weapon?'

1190
01:22:51,100 --> 01:22:52,700
'That really baffles me'

1191
01:22:54,706 --> 01:22:55,626
What, Shiva?

1192
01:22:55,705 --> 01:22:58,025
I somehow feel we won't
be able to find him

1193
01:22:58,797 --> 01:23:01,945
Finding the killer isn't some fiction
like the crime novels you read

1194
01:23:01,985 --> 01:23:04,345
Even if it's fiction,
it needs a precedence, Shiva

1195
01:23:18,545 --> 01:23:19,425
This-

1196
01:23:19,465 --> 01:23:20,785
This is Nitin's ear phone

1197
01:23:20,825 --> 01:23:21,745
Why is it here?

1198
01:23:21,785 --> 01:23:24,145
Check if his cell phone
is lying anywhere around

1199
01:23:25,705 --> 01:23:26,865
Cell phone isn't there

1200
01:23:26,905 --> 01:23:28,465
Someone has taken it

1201
01:23:28,505 --> 01:23:29,705
Not here, Maya

1202
01:23:31,985 --> 01:23:32,905
Which means...

1203
01:23:32,985 --> 01:23:34,785
...the killer wanted
Nitin's cell phone

1204
01:23:34,825 --> 01:23:37,025
How does it matter whether
he needed it or not?

1205
01:23:37,065 --> 01:23:39,385
Until we find the culprit
I'm the killer, Maya

1206
01:23:39,425 --> 01:23:42,545
All our movements would have
been recorded in the CCTV camera

1207
01:23:42,545 --> 01:23:44,625
I will be branded
as killer by everyone

1208
01:23:44,673 --> 01:23:46,353
Then in the CCTV camera...

1209
01:23:46,663 --> 01:23:48,425
...killer entering and exiting
must be recorded too!

1210
01:23:48,465 --> 01:23:49,185
Yes

1211
01:23:57,545 --> 01:23:58,825
What do we do now?

1212
01:23:59,185 --> 01:24:01,465
Wait a minute
Check if anyone is coming

1213
01:24:01,545 --> 01:24:02,985
What do you intend doing?

1214
01:24:05,265 --> 01:24:07,385
Hey! Where did you
learn all these tricks?

1215
01:24:07,465 --> 01:24:10,265
Story books are enough
Even banks can be broken into

1216
01:24:10,305 --> 01:24:11,905
Isn't Gonzalves
in charge of this?

1217
01:24:11,945 --> 01:24:14,505
Yes, but for now
only we are in charge

1218
01:24:18,105 --> 01:24:19,705
What is the password?

1219
01:24:24,305 --> 01:24:25,665
What's his full name?

1220
01:24:25,705 --> 01:24:27,145
Anthony Gonzalves

1221
01:24:35,025 --> 01:24:37,105
- What are you typing?
- Try Godzilla

1222
01:24:57,321 --> 01:24:58,361
Where...?

1223
01:25:05,745 --> 01:25:07,385
Video hasn't been recorded

1224
01:25:09,225 --> 01:25:11,545
Corridor cameras turned off
from 11:30 to 11:38

1225
01:25:11,625 --> 01:25:13,385
Nothing has been recorded

1226
01:25:13,705 --> 01:25:15,625
I came into the class at 11:38

1227
01:25:15,993 --> 01:25:18,673
Only after my entry recording
is available, look here

1228
01:25:19,665 --> 01:25:23,145
Only at 11:38
CCTV camera was turned on

1229
01:25:23,985 --> 01:25:27,905
So the killer has turned it off,
killed Nitin and then turned it on

1230
01:25:27,945 --> 01:25:31,145
Only someone very familiar with
our campus could've done this

1231
01:25:31,265 --> 01:25:32,345
You mean Godzilla?

1232
01:25:32,385 --> 01:25:33,225
No way

1233
01:25:33,974 --> 01:25:35,280
He only looks like Godzilla

1234
01:25:35,305 --> 01:25:37,465
This security system is
under his control, right?

1235
01:25:37,505 --> 01:25:39,625
Someone else could
have also accessed it

1236
01:25:39,705 --> 01:25:40,825
Like us!

1237
01:25:41,825 --> 01:25:45,105
- Did you remove his laptop and phone?
- Yes, safe in the staff room

1238
01:25:45,145 --> 01:25:46,185
Did you see the video?

1239
01:25:46,225 --> 01:25:49,785
Then we should be able to see his face
in the camera in the lab corridor

1240
01:25:49,865 --> 01:25:51,745
Click S block camera

1241
01:26:05,905 --> 01:26:08,025
She ranked me 2nd in class

1242
01:26:08,385 --> 01:26:11,625
After that when the Principal
asked her, she supported Nitin

1243
01:26:14,985 --> 01:26:17,585
Let's go to the staff room
We'll get some clue there

1244
01:26:19,185 --> 01:26:20,425
Why staff room?

1245
01:26:20,505 --> 01:26:22,025
Just come
I'll tell you

1246
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:24,880
All the blocks look the same

1247
01:26:24,905 --> 01:26:27,865
Our computer science lab
is so unique and state of the art

1248
01:26:27,945 --> 01:26:29,185
All Apple machines!

1249
01:26:29,225 --> 01:26:31,505
We've placed 60 CCTV cameras all over

1250
01:26:31,701 --> 01:26:33,665
- That too, color
- All in working condition?

1251
01:26:33,705 --> 01:26:38,265
Madam, from entrance to toilet,
everything in working condition

1252
01:26:38,545 --> 01:26:41,385
Without the Principal
or me knowing...

1253
01:26:41,425 --> 01:26:44,625
...there's no chance of even the smallest
mistake happening, madam

1254
01:26:44,665 --> 01:26:45,385
Yes, madam

1255
01:26:52,398 --> 01:26:54,238
A student by name Nitin

1256
01:26:55,385 --> 01:26:56,865
Why do you want to meet him?

1257
01:26:56,865 --> 01:26:59,025
His dad has ordered
a pizza for him

1258
01:26:59,210 --> 01:27:01,185
Can't allow pizzas
into the classroom

1259
01:27:01,305 --> 01:27:03,185
Go to the office
They will call him, okay?

1260
01:27:03,225 --> 01:27:04,185
Okay, sir

1261
01:27:05,145 --> 01:27:06,745
Check, I think this is the one

1262
01:27:06,985 --> 01:27:08,305
Math book is right there

1263
01:27:14,745 --> 01:27:16,625
Hurry up, Maya
Someone might come in

1264
01:27:16,665 --> 01:27:18,545
- I am at it
- What is that?

1265
01:27:29,025 --> 01:27:31,385
Why does she have
his picture in her diary?

1266
01:27:31,425 --> 01:27:32,705
No idea

1267
01:27:33,425 --> 01:27:34,705
There is something written

1268
01:27:34,745 --> 01:27:35,705
Read it

1269
01:27:37,985 --> 01:27:39,945
Maya, what shall we do now?

1270
01:27:40,385 --> 01:27:42,105
Something is going on between-

1271
01:27:43,952 --> 01:27:45,672
What are you both doing here?

1272
01:27:45,745 --> 01:27:47,465
Sir, Principal called you

1273
01:27:47,505 --> 01:27:48,545
Why...?

1274
01:27:48,625 --> 01:27:50,745
He called you to
the chemical storage room

1275
01:27:50,785 --> 01:27:52,265
Where did you meet him?

1276
01:27:52,305 --> 01:27:53,305
- Lab
- Auditorium

1277
01:27:55,561 --> 01:27:56,865
Lab, next to the auditorium

1278
01:27:56,905 --> 01:27:57,625
Same place, sir

1279
01:27:57,665 --> 01:27:59,385
I'll take care
You both leave

1280
01:28:02,345 --> 01:28:03,905
Let's go, Maya

1281
01:28:08,225 --> 01:28:09,745
Let's go up

1282
01:28:17,732 --> 01:28:19,812
- He has gone
- Come quick

1283
01:28:25,065 --> 01:28:26,305
Fast

1284
01:28:29,345 --> 01:28:31,105
Look over there
On that table

1285
01:28:38,545 --> 01:28:39,985
Where is it?

1286
01:28:44,585 --> 01:28:46,185
Madam, correspondent is calling

1287
01:28:46,980 --> 01:28:48,385
Has the inspection started?

1288
01:28:48,425 --> 01:28:50,145
Everything is going smooth, sir

1289
01:28:51,185 --> 01:28:52,985
Rajeswari madam has come

1290
01:28:53,512 --> 01:28:55,225
Any problem with
the Inspection team?

1291
01:28:55,265 --> 01:28:58,025
Nothing of that sort
Things are pretty smooth

1292
01:28:58,065 --> 01:29:00,785
She isn't picking up the phone
nor replying to my messages

1293
01:29:00,865 --> 01:29:02,105
Wonder where she is!

1294
01:29:03,825 --> 01:29:06,545
Did you meet
the Education minister, sir?

1295
01:29:06,985 --> 01:29:08,945
I'll take care of
madam very well, sir

1296
01:29:08,985 --> 01:29:11,865
- Show her the new air conditioned block
- Will do, sir

1297
01:29:11,945 --> 01:29:13,905
'As if he doesn't know
I'm held up here'

1298
01:29:15,746 --> 01:29:16,626
Just a minute, sir

1299
01:29:16,745 --> 01:29:18,305
Madam wants to talk to you

1300
01:29:21,734 --> 01:29:23,515
Call me after the Inspection

1301
01:29:23,540 --> 01:29:26,300
- We'll be cut off totally!
- Let's see the campus

1302
01:29:27,203 --> 01:29:30,323
Cell phones are taboo
within the school campus

1303
01:29:31,065 --> 01:29:32,545
That rule applies to you too

1304
01:29:33,366 --> 01:29:35,646
Students follow
the example you set

1305
01:29:37,385 --> 01:29:39,025
There's nothing here, Shiva

1306
01:29:40,065 --> 01:29:41,425
Please understand my urge

1307
01:29:41,465 --> 01:29:42,145
Only once

1308
01:29:42,185 --> 01:29:44,025
Okay, go fast

1309
01:29:46,145 --> 01:29:47,585
Hey! Look here

1310
01:29:52,745 --> 01:29:54,545
Open it in your style

1311
01:29:57,385 --> 01:29:59,265
'Why did he call me
to the chemical store?'

1312
01:29:59,305 --> 01:30:00,265
Quick, Maya

1313
01:30:02,745 --> 01:30:03,785
Hurry up

1314
01:30:04,505 --> 01:30:06,105
I'm unable to open it

1315
01:30:07,425 --> 01:30:08,505
Move

1316
01:30:10,505 --> 01:30:11,825
Do it fast, Shiva

1317
01:30:12,105 --> 01:30:13,865
Here, try with this

1318
01:30:15,225 --> 01:30:16,505
Push it together

1319
01:30:23,145 --> 01:30:24,545
Hey! What are you doing?

1320
01:30:24,625 --> 01:30:25,585
Search, Maya

1321
01:30:34,098 --> 01:30:36,698
'Then why ask me to come
to the chemical store?'

1322
01:30:48,637 --> 01:30:49,797
Don't touch it

1323
01:31:10,307 --> 01:31:11,467
This is Nitin's mobile

1324
01:31:11,492 --> 01:31:13,665
In Nandini ma'am's cupboard
we find Sridhar sir's photo

1325
01:31:13,798 --> 01:31:16,478
In Sridhar sir's cupboard
Nitin's laptop and cell phone

1326
01:31:16,945 --> 01:31:18,705
To top it all, bloodstained kerchief

1327
01:31:22,385 --> 01:31:24,465
If he killed him for
this laptop and cell phone...

1328
01:31:24,642 --> 01:31:26,105
...there is something
valuable here

1329
01:31:26,145 --> 01:31:29,585
Just because these are in his cupboard,
we can't prove he's the killer

1330
01:31:30,705 --> 01:31:31,945
What more do you want?

1331
01:31:31,985 --> 01:31:33,345
Let's go tell the Principal

1332
01:31:33,425 --> 01:31:35,145
What if there is
nothing inside?

1333
01:31:35,505 --> 01:31:36,985
Let's first check it

1334
01:31:39,665 --> 01:31:41,265
This has a password too

1335
01:31:41,345 --> 01:31:42,825
'Enter' is the password

1336
01:31:43,305 --> 01:31:45,425
- How do you know?
- I've seen it

1337
01:31:46,825 --> 01:31:49,305
Hey! Open that folder

1338
01:31:51,585 --> 01:31:54,705
He has hidden a camera in
our swimming pool and recorded

1339
01:31:55,425 --> 01:31:58,025
The loo seems miles away!

1340
01:31:58,153 --> 01:32:00,553
No choice
Clean India!

1341
01:32:00,770 --> 01:32:03,065
Never thought he would
be such a slimeball

1342
01:32:03,105 --> 01:32:05,505
We should be surprised
only if he didn't do all this!

1343
01:32:05,545 --> 01:32:06,305
Thank God!

1344
01:32:11,665 --> 01:32:13,425
There should be something in this

1345
01:32:21,625 --> 01:32:23,425
Who the hell is he?
Wretched fellow!

1346
01:32:23,465 --> 01:32:24,545
How will I know?

1347
01:32:24,785 --> 01:32:26,305
Thick skinned buffalo!

1348
01:32:26,985 --> 01:32:29,545
What is Nandini ma'am
doing in the swimming pool?

1349
01:32:39,705 --> 01:32:41,105
What...?

1350
01:32:53,225 --> 01:32:54,585
You lied to me?!

1351
01:32:55,785 --> 01:32:57,305
Catch the laptop

1352
01:33:02,425 --> 01:33:04,185
Let's go, Maya

1353
01:33:14,185 --> 01:33:16,825
- Maya, where are we going?
- We must check the laptop

1354
01:33:25,656 --> 01:33:27,616
They seem to be
running a marathon!

1355
01:33:27,665 --> 01:33:29,865
Shiva, I'll kill you both

1356
01:33:29,905 --> 01:33:31,025
Stop, I say

1357
01:33:36,105 --> 01:33:37,785
You must paint it
now and then

1358
01:33:37,905 --> 01:33:40,705
We are repairing the buildings
It will be done in a week

1359
01:33:42,065 --> 01:33:44,825
Boss, he is N.C.C. teacher

1360
01:33:44,865 --> 01:33:47,025
Hey! You got it wrong

1361
01:33:47,065 --> 01:33:48,225
Then don't bother

1362
01:33:51,345 --> 01:33:52,305
Good morning, sir

1363
01:33:52,425 --> 01:33:54,225
- Why did you wish him?
- Just to cover up

1364
01:33:54,265 --> 01:33:55,985
Keep walking
Don't look back

1365
01:33:56,025 --> 01:33:58,345
- Is he your friend, boss?
- He sent me to prison!

1366
01:33:58,385 --> 01:34:01,105
That's why you are terrified
even when you pass him by?

1367
01:34:02,185 --> 01:34:03,025
Hey! Aren't you-

1368
01:34:03,065 --> 01:34:04,265
Dead meat...run

1369
01:34:04,669 --> 01:34:05,505
Aren't you Kasi?

1370
01:34:05,545 --> 01:34:07,065
Don't run, stop

1371
01:34:10,022 --> 01:34:11,622
Looks like I brought
the rain with me

1372
01:34:11,647 --> 01:34:13,087
- Good omen
- Our mascot

1373
01:34:13,112 --> 01:34:14,032
Bring it here

1374
01:34:14,865 --> 01:34:16,465
You must be tired
walking nonstop

1375
01:34:16,505 --> 01:34:19,345
Why don't you have cool drinks,
something hot, coffee or tea?

1376
01:34:19,345 --> 01:34:21,345
Did I tell you
I was tired, Mr Singam?

1377
01:34:22,545 --> 01:34:25,425
- Why is he saying 'Sudandiram'?
- His name is Sudandiram

1378
01:34:25,779 --> 01:34:27,379
He has diabetes
and blood pressure

1379
01:34:27,404 --> 01:34:28,164
Did she ask you?

1380
01:34:28,189 --> 01:34:29,709
Then he should drink that tea!

1381
01:34:30,185 --> 01:34:33,025
- Why don't we eat?
- Let's all sit and eat together

1382
01:34:33,065 --> 01:34:36,785
Though you take special
care of me, my duty is first

1383
01:34:38,065 --> 01:34:39,785
- It's alright
- What do you mean by that?

1384
01:34:39,825 --> 01:34:41,985
Even if you get
my name wrong, it's alright

1385
01:34:42,025 --> 01:34:42,985
Give me coffee

1386
01:34:43,825 --> 01:34:45,385
- Principal is here
- Not here

1387
01:34:46,425 --> 01:34:47,625
Run, don't stop

1388
01:34:54,025 --> 01:34:55,905
They are practicing

1389
01:34:55,945 --> 01:34:58,585
- What practice?
- Practicing for marathon

1390
01:35:01,105 --> 01:35:03,745
Why marathon training during
class and in the corridor?

1391
01:35:03,785 --> 01:35:05,905
Something wrong, Mr Sivanandham!

1392
01:35:10,825 --> 01:35:12,105
Please drink your coffee

1393
01:35:12,185 --> 01:35:13,785
As if this is very important

1394
01:35:16,505 --> 01:35:17,505
Who is he?

1395
01:35:17,545 --> 01:35:19,385
Coach...?

1396
01:35:19,425 --> 01:35:20,705
You hit the nail on the head

1397
01:35:20,745 --> 01:35:22,185
He's the trainer
for the marathon

1398
01:35:22,225 --> 01:35:24,465
Looks like he's chasing
someone to bash up

1399
01:35:29,346 --> 01:35:30,385
I can't run beyond this

1400
01:35:30,721 --> 01:35:31,665
Kill him outside this place

1401
01:35:31,705 --> 01:35:34,865
You wouldn't have got this post
but for your gift of the gab!

1402
01:35:34,905 --> 01:35:37,185
Move, so I can go-

1403
01:35:58,745 --> 01:36:00,505
Boss, there are people up there

1404
01:36:01,585 --> 01:36:02,745
Lift him to that side

1405
01:36:05,140 --> 01:36:06,996
Your school's reputation
has gone for a toss

1406
01:36:07,021 --> 01:36:09,901
Madam, you got
my name right finally

1407
01:36:10,454 --> 01:36:12,694
- Hold his arm and lift
- He's sliding down

1408
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:14,600
My blessed cap!

1409
01:36:15,785 --> 01:36:18,625
- Don't leave me alone
- Das's cap, boss

1410
01:36:24,385 --> 01:36:25,705
We are running unnecessarily

1411
01:36:25,745 --> 01:36:27,465
We could've given it
to the Principal

1412
01:36:31,025 --> 01:36:32,425
Watch out

1413
01:36:38,545 --> 01:36:40,145
I bumped into you by mistake

1414
01:36:40,345 --> 01:36:41,345
Who are you, sir?

1415
01:36:41,385 --> 01:36:43,065
I'm a teacher here

1416
01:36:43,175 --> 01:36:45,375
- Where are you running to?
- Principal called me

1417
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:47,960
- Do you have to run if he calls?
- He called me urgently, sir

1418
01:36:47,985 --> 01:36:49,305
Who is Gonzalves here?

1419
01:36:49,385 --> 01:36:51,385
- I'm Sridhar
- But where is Gonzales?

1420
01:36:51,425 --> 01:36:52,585
He hasn't come today

1421
01:36:52,665 --> 01:36:53,865
I was told he is here

1422
01:36:53,905 --> 01:36:55,345
Then he should be
in the staff room

1423
01:36:55,385 --> 01:36:57,545
- Where's the staff room?
- It's on this side

1424
01:36:57,545 --> 01:36:59,505
Here, there, so far
all wrong directions!

1425
01:36:59,545 --> 01:37:00,425
You work here?

1426
01:37:00,425 --> 01:37:02,185
You can go this way or that way!

1427
01:37:03,945 --> 01:37:05,065
Thanks a lot

1428
01:37:06,825 --> 01:37:08,185
Don't run

1429
01:37:13,462 --> 01:37:15,662
Hey Das!
Get up

1430
01:37:15,822 --> 01:37:17,662
He gets into messy affairs

1431
01:37:17,662 --> 01:37:19,422
You didn't find
a female in our area?

1432
01:37:19,447 --> 01:37:21,527
- It's called 'love', boss
- What crap!

1433
01:37:22,142 --> 01:37:23,982
Ssshhh!
Someone's there

1434
01:37:24,062 --> 01:37:26,702
Squat right there
Don't make a sound

1435
01:37:29,542 --> 01:37:31,462
'Greetings, bro'

1436
01:37:32,982 --> 01:37:34,342
Hey! Our brother

1437
01:37:34,382 --> 01:37:36,542
Good afternoon, bro

1438
01:37:36,622 --> 01:37:37,902
Maya, we are caught

1439
01:37:38,462 --> 01:37:40,982
I'll handle him, my dad
is Assistant Commissioner

1440
01:37:42,182 --> 01:37:44,182
Sir...I didn't do it

1441
01:37:44,422 --> 01:37:46,702
Principal called us
We are going to his office

1442
01:37:50,022 --> 01:37:52,102
Where can I find
Anthony Gonzalves?

1443
01:38:03,222 --> 01:38:05,062
3rd floor staff room

1444
01:38:08,422 --> 01:38:09,782
Don't blabber and get caught

1445
01:38:09,822 --> 01:38:11,142
I managed somehow, right?

1446
01:38:16,702 --> 01:38:17,822
Go inside

1447
01:38:23,856 --> 01:38:25,176
Thank God!

1448
01:38:31,427 --> 01:38:34,427
Sridhar is the one
who has killed Nitin

1449
01:38:35,570 --> 01:38:36,650
1 minute

1450
01:38:41,611 --> 01:38:43,411
'Sridhar sir has a problem with Nitin'

1451
01:38:43,452 --> 01:38:46,932
'When Nitin was alone
to get this video from him...'

1452
01:38:47,215 --> 01:38:49,295
'...Sridhar sir has come
into our classroom'

1453
01:38:50,594 --> 01:38:51,674
Get up

1454
01:38:51,914 --> 01:38:52,834
Where's the laptop?

1455
01:38:52,859 --> 01:38:54,459
Give it or else I'll kill you

1456
01:38:54,484 --> 01:38:55,884
'He would have
refused to give it'

1457
01:38:56,009 --> 01:38:57,129
I can't give it to you

1458
01:38:57,162 --> 01:38:58,162
I'll kill you

1459
01:38:58,269 --> 01:38:59,709
What will you do?

1460
01:38:59,962 --> 01:39:01,242
I'll show you

1461
01:39:02,053 --> 01:39:04,613
'In his rage to get
the video somehow...'

1462
01:39:04,882 --> 01:39:06,762
'...Sridhar sir has killed Nitin'

1463
01:39:06,873 --> 01:39:10,073
'And taken his laptop
and cell phone'

1464
01:39:16,034 --> 01:39:17,794
'Without anyone's knowledge...'

1465
01:39:17,819 --> 01:39:22,859
'...he has locked the laptop
and phone in his drawer'

1466
01:39:30,677 --> 01:39:32,517
'Before entering the class room...'

1467
01:39:32,542 --> 01:39:36,342
'...he has switched on
the CCTV cameras he had turned off'

1468
01:39:36,367 --> 01:39:41,167
'That was when I walked in
to the class room to confront him'

1469
01:39:41,342 --> 01:39:43,142
What the hell
is your problem?

1470
01:39:43,542 --> 01:39:46,182
It took me 2 years to
prepare the thesis you burnt

1471
01:39:46,222 --> 01:39:47,862
You won't understand all that

1472
01:39:48,222 --> 01:39:50,062
You and I are from
2 different worlds

1473
01:39:50,502 --> 01:39:51,582
'But-'

1474
01:39:57,382 --> 01:39:58,782
What happened?

1475
01:40:10,622 --> 01:40:12,702
'That was when I entered, right?'

1476
01:40:15,504 --> 01:40:17,544
Sridhar wanted to
protect Nandini teacher

1477
01:40:17,569 --> 01:40:19,329
We'll give this laptop
to the Principal

1478
01:40:19,462 --> 01:40:22,102
Only then the full truth
will come out in the open

1479
01:40:22,442 --> 01:40:23,402
Hey Shiva!

1480
01:40:23,427 --> 01:40:25,147
You had better
give me the laptop

1481
01:40:25,218 --> 01:40:27,058
You can't get away from me

1482
01:40:27,083 --> 01:40:28,083
Can't you hear me?

1483
01:40:28,317 --> 01:40:29,653
- I want the laptop
- I won't give, sir

1484
01:40:29,678 --> 01:40:32,678
Instead of being a role model
for students, to hide your folly...

1485
01:40:32,888 --> 01:40:34,608
...you've even murdered a boy

1486
01:40:34,633 --> 01:40:35,753
Shut up!

1487
01:40:35,832 --> 01:40:37,672
Don't add on to your crimes

1488
01:40:37,697 --> 01:40:39,257
Accept your crime

1489
01:40:39,297 --> 01:40:41,377
I swear I didn't kill Nitin

1490
01:40:41,800 --> 01:40:43,840
I went in to threaten him

1491
01:40:43,950 --> 01:40:45,870
He was already lying
in a pool of blood

1492
01:40:46,588 --> 01:40:48,308
I took only what I needed

1493
01:40:52,462 --> 01:40:54,022
I don't know
what happened

1494
01:40:55,182 --> 01:40:56,782
Shiva, he's lying

1495
01:40:57,194 --> 01:40:58,994
Some outsider is the killer

1496
01:40:59,019 --> 01:41:01,499
I saw the correspondent
of RK school in our campus

1497
01:41:01,524 --> 01:41:02,804
He must be the killer

1498
01:41:02,967 --> 01:41:05,320
He didn't want our school
to get ISO endorsement

1499
01:41:05,345 --> 01:41:07,025
Sir, how are the 2 related?

1500
01:41:07,195 --> 01:41:08,875
How do I make you understand?

1501
01:41:08,923 --> 01:41:11,363
Am I an idiot to kill him
with a knife in the classroom?

1502
01:41:11,434 --> 01:41:12,194
'Knife?'

1503
01:41:13,058 --> 01:41:15,418
There's no need for me
to explain beyond this

1504
01:41:15,607 --> 01:41:16,727
Give the laptop now

1505
01:41:16,822 --> 01:41:18,502
What are you doing?

1506
01:41:19,277 --> 01:41:20,637
Who asked you to hit him?

1507
01:41:20,662 --> 01:41:22,102
Why are you saying this?

1508
01:41:22,330 --> 01:41:23,970
I hit him to save you

1509
01:41:25,151 --> 01:41:26,031
He's still breathing

1510
01:41:26,056 --> 01:41:27,337
I hope he is alright

1511
01:41:27,427 --> 01:41:29,387
Shiva, he isn't the murderer

1512
01:41:29,552 --> 01:41:30,312
Murder?!

1513
01:41:30,462 --> 01:41:31,696
Idiot! Don't shout

1514
01:41:31,721 --> 01:41:32,721
Shut up

1515
01:41:32,785 --> 01:41:34,825
Nitin was stabbed by a pencil

1516
01:41:34,850 --> 01:41:36,330
But he said 'knife' to us

1517
01:41:36,409 --> 01:41:39,089
'Maybe I should have
gone straight to the loo'

1518
01:41:46,625 --> 01:41:48,145
I wonder who this is?

1519
01:41:49,004 --> 01:41:50,124
Open it

1520
01:41:53,092 --> 01:41:55,252
We can open the phone
with Nitin's fingerprint

1521
01:41:55,449 --> 01:41:56,619
Go to our classroom then

1522
01:41:56,745 --> 01:41:57,905
Keep an eye on him

1523
01:41:58,048 --> 01:42:00,048
Safeguard the laptop
Don't move

1524
01:42:00,135 --> 01:42:01,935
Don't leave me alone please

1525
01:42:08,005 --> 01:42:09,605
Why are the police here?

1526
01:42:09,846 --> 01:42:12,126
He is our old student

1527
01:42:12,301 --> 01:42:13,621
They visit us quite often

1528
01:42:15,407 --> 01:42:16,487
Aren't you the Principal?

1529
01:42:18,296 --> 01:42:19,696
You are the Principal

1530
01:42:21,382 --> 01:42:23,702
I don't want that post
even if you offer it to me

1531
01:42:24,224 --> 01:42:26,142
- He is the Principal
- I need to talk to you alone

1532
01:42:26,182 --> 01:42:27,248
What is it about?

1533
01:42:27,273 --> 01:42:28,521
Let madam finish her Inspection

1534
01:42:28,546 --> 01:42:30,626
Then we can talk
Wait in my office

1535
01:42:31,694 --> 01:42:34,065
I've been wandering around in
your school for half an hour, sir

1536
01:42:34,090 --> 01:42:35,250
Who is Gonzalves here?

1537
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:36,720
He is Gonzalves

1538
01:42:38,076 --> 01:42:39,036
You, huh?

1539
01:42:41,142 --> 01:42:44,302
The Commissioner wanted me
to talk to you in private

1540
01:42:45,189 --> 01:42:47,029
The Commissioner is my classmate

1541
01:42:47,102 --> 01:42:49,502
He sends police officers quite often

1542
01:42:49,527 --> 01:42:51,578
Affectionate obligations!

1543
01:42:58,102 --> 01:43:00,382
Inspector, did you
study in this school?

1544
01:43:00,422 --> 01:43:01,102
Actually, I-

1545
01:43:01,182 --> 01:43:02,462
All are old students

1546
01:43:02,582 --> 01:43:05,262
He's the old student of
the school he studied in!

1547
01:43:05,422 --> 01:43:07,462
Did the Commissioner
really send you?

1548
01:43:07,613 --> 01:43:10,613
Aren't you the one who broke
a student's finger with a pencil?

1549
01:43:10,638 --> 01:43:13,398
Sir, I don't touch anyone
with my hand

1550
01:43:13,761 --> 01:43:15,681
I keep my hands folded
while I speak, sir

1551
01:43:15,706 --> 01:43:17,186
But aren't you Mr Gonzalves?

1552
01:43:18,456 --> 01:43:21,616
Actually my name is
Govindasamy in Tamil

1553
01:43:21,641 --> 01:43:23,761
My pet name is Gonz

1554
01:43:24,071 --> 01:43:26,351
You are looking for
Anthony Gonzalves

1555
01:43:26,663 --> 01:43:29,742
He will be in the library
drinking tea now

1556
01:43:29,782 --> 01:43:31,342
Go and look for him there

1557
01:43:31,902 --> 01:43:33,462
Drink tea in the lib-

1558
01:43:33,487 --> 01:43:34,367
1 minute

1559
01:43:34,422 --> 01:43:35,782
Where is the library?

1560
01:43:40,382 --> 01:43:41,582
Go down?

1561
01:43:41,607 --> 01:43:42,927
I am coming from there now

1562
01:43:42,952 --> 01:43:44,592
Go back where you came from!

1563
01:43:44,742 --> 01:43:46,222
Height of confusion!

1564
01:43:48,354 --> 01:43:50,354
This laptop adds
to my misery

1565
01:43:51,102 --> 01:43:53,902
No one understands my urgency

1566
01:43:58,982 --> 01:44:01,062
Move...move...move

1567
01:44:04,464 --> 01:44:05,624
Opened at last

1568
01:44:05,982 --> 01:44:07,982
So many messages
from Pencil's number

1569
01:44:08,022 --> 01:44:10,062
How do we find out
who this 'Pencil' is?

1570
01:44:10,770 --> 01:44:13,328
Let's type this number
in True Caller

1571
01:44:13,353 --> 01:44:14,593
We'll check it out now

1572
01:44:19,745 --> 01:44:20,865
Indulekha?

1573
01:44:22,182 --> 01:44:24,182
Could it be Indulekha
from grade XI?

1574
01:44:26,383 --> 01:44:28,103
Just a guess

1575
01:44:30,831 --> 01:44:33,311
At 11:28 she has texted
'I will kill you'

1576
01:44:33,422 --> 01:44:36,022
- Phew! Narrow escape!
-11:32 Nitin died

1577
01:44:38,845 --> 01:44:41,965
We'll send a message to Indulekha
as if Nitin has sent it to her

1578
01:44:42,177 --> 01:44:44,177
If she comes back
to the classroom...

1579
01:44:45,142 --> 01:44:46,702
...then she is the killer

1580
01:44:46,822 --> 01:44:49,312
Inspection is going on
Why are you calling me repeatedly?

1581
01:44:49,337 --> 01:44:50,377
What is so urgent?

1582
01:44:50,822 --> 01:44:53,022
Nitin...is lying dead
in the classroom, sir

1583
01:44:54,142 --> 01:44:55,822
Someone has killed him, sir

1584
01:44:56,982 --> 01:44:58,862
How do I dispose his body?

1585
01:45:04,034 --> 01:45:05,602
Mr Shanmugam, come
It's getting late

1586
01:45:05,743 --> 01:45:06,783
I'm coming, madam

1587
01:45:06,808 --> 01:45:07,928
Get this into your head

1588
01:45:08,194 --> 01:45:10,474
Even so, she won't come, Maya

1589
01:45:10,851 --> 01:45:15,531
If the murderer was a male
he has to be a 6 footer

1590
01:45:15,610 --> 01:45:17,090
Weighing 80 kgs

1591
01:45:17,551 --> 01:45:19,431
If the killer is a female
just 2 eyes will do

1592
01:45:19,597 --> 01:45:21,357
She'll come here
You stick around

1593
01:45:21,498 --> 01:45:23,698
Where do I park this luggage?

1594
01:45:26,923 --> 01:45:27,723
Indu...?

1595
01:45:30,022 --> 01:45:31,582
She's entering the classroom

1596
01:46:01,690 --> 01:46:03,050
What is happening here?

1597
01:46:06,299 --> 01:46:07,579
I can't do it

1598
01:46:07,604 --> 01:46:08,324
Just once

1599
01:46:08,692 --> 01:46:09,772
Don't touch me

1600
01:46:14,611 --> 01:46:15,651
Scumbag!

1601
01:46:16,331 --> 01:46:18,131
My life is ruined
because of you

1602
01:46:18,256 --> 01:46:20,176
Why do you torture me like this?

1603
01:46:20,201 --> 01:46:22,521
I can't focus on
my studies at all

1604
01:46:22,546 --> 01:46:24,677
I lost my peace of mind
the day I set eyes on you

1605
01:46:24,769 --> 01:46:25,449
Hey! Wait

1606
01:46:25,634 --> 01:46:27,994
How dare you walk away
without answering me

1607
01:46:29,542 --> 01:46:31,062
Leave me alone

1608
01:46:31,714 --> 01:46:33,034
I'm begging you

1609
01:46:33,059 --> 01:46:33,962
Why should you plead?

1610
01:46:33,987 --> 01:46:36,107
If you listen to me
we can both be happy

1611
01:46:36,317 --> 01:46:37,637
Am I right?

1612
01:46:37,927 --> 01:46:39,607
Take your hands off me

1613
01:46:40,081 --> 01:46:41,881
Divya, why did you come here?

1614
01:46:42,528 --> 01:46:46,728
Don't worry, I'm advising
your sister who is into bad ways

1615
01:46:48,099 --> 01:46:50,019
My sister is a good girl

1616
01:46:50,778 --> 01:46:52,058
You're a kid, dear

1617
01:46:52,083 --> 01:46:54,243
You don't tell me about her
Let's go, Indu

1618
01:46:54,557 --> 01:46:55,917
Don't walk away now

1619
01:46:55,942 --> 01:46:56,822
Listen to me

1620
01:46:56,862 --> 01:46:58,022
Don't cry, akka

1621
01:46:58,102 --> 01:47:00,702
I'll ask my dad
to hit that uncle

1622
01:47:01,102 --> 01:47:03,102
I'm talking to you
and you're ignoring me

1623
01:47:03,182 --> 01:47:04,942
What are you doing?
Let go of her

1624
01:47:04,982 --> 01:47:06,702
Try to walk away now

1625
01:47:12,462 --> 01:47:14,622
- Rescue her
- Why are you perturbed?!

1626
01:47:17,622 --> 01:47:20,262
Save me, akka

1627
01:47:22,062 --> 01:47:23,862
Save her

1628
01:47:24,262 --> 01:47:25,742
She is a small kid

1629
01:47:30,942 --> 01:47:32,102
Okay, I agree

1630
01:47:33,062 --> 01:47:34,822
Took you so long to agree

1631
01:47:41,022 --> 01:47:42,382
You are to blame

1632
01:47:43,182 --> 01:47:45,102
Don't go and
tell this to anyone

1633
01:47:45,222 --> 01:47:47,662
Because we are in this
hand and glove

1634
01:47:47,729 --> 01:47:48,649
I did this?

1635
01:47:48,822 --> 01:47:51,182
If you had agreed to me
in the first place...

1636
01:47:51,222 --> 01:47:53,222
...why would she be in the pool?

1637
01:47:53,543 --> 01:47:55,143
Let go of me

1638
01:47:55,342 --> 01:47:57,702
Let's go before
anyone sees us here

1639
01:47:59,622 --> 01:48:02,142
Such a small kid Divya

1640
01:48:03,274 --> 01:48:05,074
Real smart kid

1641
01:48:05,248 --> 01:48:08,368
She was very fond of me

1642
01:48:08,571 --> 01:48:10,011
'I liked her very much too'

1643
01:48:10,297 --> 01:48:13,177
'She followed me
like a little lamb'

1644
01:48:14,761 --> 01:48:19,041
This rowdy was blackmailing me

1645
01:48:19,199 --> 01:48:21,759
For the past 2 years

1646
01:48:22,182 --> 01:48:25,382
I couldn't share this
with anyone, Maya

1647
01:48:35,992 --> 01:48:36,992
Good afternoon, sir

1648
01:48:37,017 --> 01:48:39,857
- What brings you here, sir?
- You thought I won't come?

1649
01:48:39,935 --> 01:48:41,895
Even if the greased palm is not thankful

1650
01:48:41,982 --> 01:48:44,342
...shouldn't the mouth
that got fed be grateful?!

1651
01:48:44,342 --> 01:48:45,782
Sir, don't let your tongue run

1652
01:48:45,807 --> 01:48:47,771
I can't be forced to teach
only in your school

1653
01:48:47,796 --> 01:48:48,782
Knowledge is mine

1654
01:48:48,859 --> 01:48:50,826
I decide where and
whom to impart it to!

1655
01:48:50,999 --> 01:48:52,799
If the person with
intellect decides...

1656
01:48:52,824 --> 01:48:55,784
...you think with all my money
I will twiddle my thumb?!

1657
01:48:57,900 --> 01:48:59,580
Pick up the damn phone

1658
01:49:00,058 --> 01:49:01,978
'Someone is coming'

1659
01:49:02,279 --> 01:49:04,319
Who is this in a wheel chair?

1660
01:49:05,953 --> 01:49:07,433
Your legs are too long, sir!

1661
01:49:07,622 --> 01:49:09,262
I can't hold it any longer

1662
01:49:10,849 --> 01:49:12,929
Poor teacher!

1663
01:49:14,883 --> 01:49:16,523
This bloody zip!

1664
01:49:24,187 --> 01:49:25,667
What could have happened?

1665
01:49:26,168 --> 01:49:28,208
Who is the murderer?

1666
01:49:28,893 --> 01:49:31,373
Did you kill him
for burning your thesis?

1667
01:49:31,634 --> 01:49:33,194
I didn't kill him
Shut up

1668
01:49:33,219 --> 01:49:34,939
Then she must have killed him

1669
01:49:35,549 --> 01:49:37,613
I told you to wait there
Who asked you to come here?

1670
01:49:37,638 --> 01:49:39,038
I solved all that by myself

1671
01:49:39,632 --> 01:49:41,272
What the hell did you solve?

1672
01:49:44,696 --> 01:49:46,576
'What could be the killer's motive?'

1673
01:49:46,601 --> 01:49:51,521
'If it was avenging the child's death
why wait for 2 years and why today?'

1674
01:49:51,554 --> 01:49:54,634
'Why target Nithin on Sports day?'

1675
01:49:58,702 --> 01:50:00,022
'Why kill at 11:30?'

1676
01:50:14,480 --> 01:50:16,160
Napoleon, it's up to you

1677
01:50:16,302 --> 01:50:18,182
The bell shouldn't ring
for this period

1678
01:50:18,182 --> 01:50:19,982
I'll take care of that

1679
01:50:20,307 --> 01:50:22,627
NSS class has assembled
in the ground outside

1680
01:50:22,862 --> 01:50:26,502
Ask the master to hold the class
saying the Inspection team is coming

1681
01:50:29,975 --> 01:50:32,975
On Sports day Gopi had fainted
near the swimming pool, right?

1682
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:34,440
He drank juice that day

1683
01:50:34,542 --> 01:50:37,702
Ask him who offered him
that glass of juice, okay?

1684
01:50:37,864 --> 01:50:39,624
Where are you going?

1685
01:50:39,782 --> 01:50:41,862
I'm going to the library
I'll join you in a bit

1686
01:50:53,134 --> 01:50:55,014
'Why couldn't Maya be the killer?'

1687
01:51:00,294 --> 01:51:01,734
What's special over there?

1688
01:51:06,974 --> 01:51:09,214
Why are you walking backwards?

1689
01:51:15,454 --> 01:51:17,534
Madam, don't go in

1690
01:51:18,521 --> 01:51:19,481
Lord Muruga, help!

1691
01:51:19,614 --> 01:51:22,414
Why is the projector running?
No one is in the classroom

1692
01:51:22,414 --> 01:51:25,654
- Shouldn't waste electricity
- Thank God, it's clean now

1693
01:51:26,296 --> 01:51:28,376
Classroom is neat and clean

1694
01:51:33,541 --> 01:51:36,381
I asked them to clean it up
And they did a good job

1695
01:51:36,654 --> 01:51:39,494
You had to tell them to clean?
It should be clean always

1696
01:51:39,534 --> 01:51:40,619
Not when you tell them

1697
01:51:40,644 --> 01:51:42,019
Get up, Ravikumar

1698
01:51:42,044 --> 01:51:43,364
I can hear footsteps again

1699
01:51:44,694 --> 01:51:47,534
What are they lugging now?

1700
01:51:50,430 --> 01:51:52,070
Steamed cake!

1701
01:51:52,134 --> 01:51:54,092
We were supposed
to kill this boy

1702
01:51:54,117 --> 01:51:56,277
Is this a store room
or a mortuary?

1703
01:51:59,774 --> 01:52:04,214
Sir, Principal and ISO officers
are coming here to inspect

1704
01:52:04,239 --> 01:52:07,420
I was asked to tell you to keep
the students here even if the bell goes

1705
01:52:07,458 --> 01:52:09,298
- Even after the bell rings?
- Yes, sir

1706
01:52:10,094 --> 01:52:11,494
Who is this?

1707
01:52:13,096 --> 01:52:14,856
For 3 days no time
to even breathe

1708
01:52:15,014 --> 01:52:15,774
1 minute

1709
01:52:15,814 --> 01:52:16,934
Time to ring the bell

1710
01:52:16,974 --> 01:52:18,254
Let me ring the bell

1711
01:52:20,094 --> 01:52:21,134
What happened?

1712
01:52:21,414 --> 01:52:23,734
You fainted on that day
after you drank juice?

1713
01:52:23,734 --> 01:52:25,254
- When?
- On Sports day

1714
01:52:25,294 --> 01:52:26,494
Yes, why?

1715
01:52:26,534 --> 01:52:28,214
Who gave you that juice?

1716
01:52:43,035 --> 01:52:44,235
My name?

1717
01:52:50,534 --> 01:52:52,774
Then this book should
also have more copies

1718
01:53:15,134 --> 01:53:16,974
NSS students gave me

1719
01:53:17,294 --> 01:53:19,449
Who told them to
distribute the juice?

1720
01:53:19,474 --> 01:53:21,003
I don't remember now

1721
01:53:21,209 --> 01:53:23,089
- Forgot, Shiva
- Think...think

1722
01:53:29,740 --> 01:53:31,180
Then?

1723
01:53:36,814 --> 01:53:39,334
KS sir had arranged it
on the table

1724
01:53:43,134 --> 01:53:46,054
What are you doing here
when Inspection is going on?

1725
01:53:48,297 --> 01:53:49,577
In the absence of a teacher...

1726
01:53:49,648 --> 01:53:52,168
...don't you know it is wrong
to access the computer?

1727
01:53:52,193 --> 01:53:53,193
I know, sir

1728
01:53:54,014 --> 01:53:56,534
Why are you not in class, sir?

1729
01:53:56,937 --> 01:53:58,246
You've changed your shirt too

1730
01:53:58,271 --> 01:54:00,471
What audacity to interrogate me!

1731
01:54:01,157 --> 01:54:04,717
You've taken a copy of this book
and not returned it for a whole year

1732
01:54:05,579 --> 01:54:09,499
David would have killed
his pet cat with a pencil

1733
01:54:09,562 --> 01:54:11,442
I know
I've read this

1734
01:54:11,498 --> 01:54:12,298
Where is Nitin?

1735
01:54:12,354 --> 01:54:13,874
Nitin or Nitin's dead body?

1736
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:15,320
Don't act smart

1737
01:54:15,345 --> 01:54:19,065
You targeted Nitin in the pool and
poisoned him but he had a lucky escape

1738
01:54:19,090 --> 01:54:20,770
You've killed him with a pencil

1739
01:54:20,919 --> 01:54:21,959
I will-

1740
01:54:27,814 --> 01:54:30,174
First we shall take
a look at the library

1741
01:54:30,774 --> 01:54:34,014
Our library is the biggest
in the whole of South Asia

1742
01:54:37,441 --> 01:54:39,694
Don't interfere in what
doesn't concern you

1743
01:54:39,734 --> 01:54:41,814
Tell me where
you've hidden Nitin

1744
01:54:47,614 --> 01:54:50,054
You won't understand my motive

1745
01:54:52,454 --> 01:54:53,614
Tell me, Maya

1746
01:55:03,174 --> 01:55:04,534
Don't, sir

1747
01:55:05,054 --> 01:55:07,374
I don't have time to play
hide and seek with you

1748
01:55:07,374 --> 01:55:09,054
Where have you hidden Nitin?

1749
01:55:09,254 --> 01:55:10,734
Answer me

1750
01:55:11,734 --> 01:55:13,774
Maya, stop!

1751
01:55:33,414 --> 01:55:35,934
Before the Inspection ends
I need Nitin's body

1752
01:55:35,974 --> 01:55:37,254
Tell me

1753
01:55:42,334 --> 01:55:44,134
You can't escape from me

1754
01:56:21,414 --> 01:56:23,494
(phone rings)

1755
01:56:55,854 --> 01:57:00,334
You can't leave this library
till you tell me where his body is

1756
01:57:00,574 --> 01:57:02,094
Where is Nitin?

1757
01:57:26,854 --> 01:57:27,974
Let go of me, sir

1758
01:57:28,054 --> 01:57:29,214
Don't, sir

1759
01:57:30,014 --> 01:57:32,014
Tell me where Nitin is
I will let you go

1760
01:57:38,974 --> 01:57:40,614
You can't escape from me

1761
01:57:40,654 --> 01:57:41,614
Shiva!

1762
01:57:42,414 --> 01:57:43,734
What are you doing, sir?

1763
01:57:43,774 --> 01:57:46,134
If what I want doesn't happen
I'll kill both of you

1764
01:57:46,174 --> 01:57:47,694
Shiva, he killed Nitin

1765
01:57:47,734 --> 01:57:49,094
Yes, I killed him

1766
01:57:50,934 --> 01:57:52,374
Run, Maya

1767
01:57:58,214 --> 01:58:00,334
I waited for 2 years
for this day, Shiva

1768
01:58:00,374 --> 01:58:02,454
You cannot escape from me

1769
01:58:07,094 --> 01:58:10,214
Tell me where
you have hidden Nitin

1770
01:58:10,814 --> 01:58:11,894
Grab him

1771
01:58:11,934 --> 01:58:13,254
Shiva, don't

1772
01:58:13,294 --> 01:58:14,614
I don't have time

1773
01:58:14,654 --> 01:58:16,094
My plan has to succeed

1774
01:58:16,894 --> 01:58:18,454
Aiyo! Must keep this clean

1775
01:58:18,494 --> 01:58:20,014
This place looks abandoned

1776
01:58:20,094 --> 01:58:21,374
Look at the cobwebs

1777
01:58:26,574 --> 01:58:28,134
First check
if he is breathing

1778
01:58:28,174 --> 01:58:29,294
No, madam

1779
01:58:30,814 --> 01:58:32,694
I did it for the welfare
of the students

1780
01:58:32,734 --> 01:58:34,934
How can you justify
a murder, sir?

1781
01:58:35,094 --> 01:58:36,414
Who is he?

1782
01:58:36,494 --> 01:58:38,774
He is Sridhar
Our school teacher

1783
01:58:38,934 --> 01:58:40,614
Who is he?

1784
01:58:40,654 --> 01:58:42,174
He is Rangasamy

1785
01:58:42,214 --> 01:58:44,134
Correspondent of
Alamelu school

1786
01:58:44,214 --> 01:58:45,374
What are you doing here?

1787
01:58:45,399 --> 01:58:46,719
Came to meet madam

1788
01:58:46,774 --> 01:58:47,734
Who is this?

1789
01:58:47,829 --> 01:58:49,429
Ravikumar the new teacher

1790
01:58:49,454 --> 01:58:51,094
I didn't kill him
to get you caught

1791
01:58:51,134 --> 01:58:52,134
Don't spare him, Shiva

1792
01:58:52,174 --> 01:58:53,614
Oh God! Is this a school?

1793
01:58:53,734 --> 01:58:56,094
Is it a riot with bodies
strewn around?

1794
01:58:56,134 --> 01:58:58,094
Aren't you aware
of any of this?

1795
01:58:58,134 --> 01:59:00,934
Madam, how will I know?
I was with you the whole time

1796
01:59:00,974 --> 01:59:02,774
Who is standing there now?

1797
01:59:02,814 --> 01:59:04,294
I suspected him right then

1798
01:59:04,334 --> 01:59:06,054
He belongs to the slum nearby

1799
01:59:06,094 --> 01:59:07,254
Nab him

1800
01:59:07,454 --> 01:59:09,734
What's happening here?

1801
01:59:09,774 --> 01:59:11,334
I'm terrified

1802
01:59:11,374 --> 01:59:13,574
Princi, call the ambulance

1803
01:59:15,614 --> 01:59:18,054
I'll accept I'm the murderer
in front of everyone

1804
01:59:18,094 --> 01:59:19,174
Let go of me now

1805
01:59:19,254 --> 01:59:21,334
Whatever you say
you cannot escape, sir

1806
01:59:29,454 --> 01:59:30,534
Mr Sudandhiram

1807
01:59:30,574 --> 01:59:32,694
Gone...everything
is gone with the wind

1808
01:59:39,654 --> 01:59:42,494
How could you murder a student
being a teacher yourself?

1809
01:59:42,494 --> 01:59:47,334
Is it true you killed his son due to
a feud between you and Vijithkanth?

1810
01:59:47,374 --> 01:59:49,494
It seems you misbehaved
with a girl in school

1811
01:59:49,534 --> 01:59:51,934
And you killed him
because he confronted you

1812
01:59:51,934 --> 01:59:53,054
Is that true?

1813
01:59:54,334 --> 01:59:56,934
Only after someone dies
will you lend me your ears

1814
01:59:56,974 --> 01:59:58,894
That too, the deceased
should be a VIP

1815
01:59:58,894 --> 02:00:01,894
If a laborer dies when constructing
a building, that's bit news

1816
02:00:01,934 --> 02:00:04,359
But the same building collapses
and 60 people die...

1817
02:00:04,544 --> 02:00:06,784
...that's sensational important news

1818
02:00:08,694 --> 02:00:11,254
Look how worthless
a life is valued?

1819
02:00:11,774 --> 02:00:14,374
In this same school,
2 years ago...

1820
02:00:15,934 --> 02:00:17,974
...in a swimming pool, a child-

1821
02:00:19,974 --> 02:00:21,854
A child fell into the pool and died

1822
02:00:23,254 --> 02:00:24,934
Your memory will be short

1823
02:00:25,614 --> 02:00:27,894
If you had thought
that tragic death...

1824
02:00:28,014 --> 02:00:32,334
...was an important piece of news

1825
02:00:33,564 --> 02:00:36,164
...I won't be standing
as a culprit before you now

1826
02:00:40,534 --> 02:00:41,654
My child

1827
02:00:44,254 --> 02:00:45,494
My daughter, Divya

1828
02:01:10,974 --> 02:01:13,134
What wrong did she do?

1829
02:01:14,270 --> 02:01:15,430
Tell me

1830
02:01:22,854 --> 02:01:25,774
'There is no meaning
to a solitary life'

1831
02:01:26,934 --> 02:01:32,014
'My wife, daughter and I
were a close knit family'

1832
02:01:32,534 --> 02:01:35,214
'Nitin destroyed
all that in a minute'

1833
02:01:37,134 --> 02:01:42,694
'If I had thought of taking
revenge on Nitin for Divya's sake...'

1834
02:01:43,774 --> 02:01:46,934
'...I would have killed him
the day I knew he was the murderer'

1835
02:01:46,974 --> 02:01:49,774
'It is an age when they are
unaware of their shortcomings'

1836
02:01:49,774 --> 02:01:50,694
'Teenager'

1837
02:01:50,734 --> 02:01:54,534
'That's why I didn't take any action
though I was seeing him daily'

1838
02:01:55,774 --> 02:02:02,134
'But using his money power and influence
he thought he could get away with murder'

1839
02:02:02,374 --> 02:02:04,894
'Using my child's demise
as a convenient excuse...'

1840
02:02:05,134 --> 02:02:07,454
'...he was ruining
an innocent girl's life'

1841
02:02:07,694 --> 02:02:09,734
Only punishment
can appease a crime

1842
02:02:11,654 --> 02:02:13,694
'More than taking
revenge on him...'

1843
02:02:13,734 --> 02:02:19,174
'...I wanted this management which was
supporting his crimes to be exposed'

1844
02:02:21,334 --> 02:02:24,414
'The management which thrived in
covering up all escapades...'

1845
02:02:24,454 --> 02:02:27,094
'...I knew would do so
in this matter also'

1846
02:02:27,134 --> 02:02:30,774
'I dealt with him
on the day of the Inspection'

1847
02:02:35,734 --> 02:02:40,614
'I knew my act won't change
this society drastically'

1848
02:02:44,574 --> 02:02:46,254
Then what is your problem?

1849
02:02:46,294 --> 02:02:48,614
Not my problem
It is our problem

1850
02:02:49,214 --> 02:02:52,094
The same school expelled
a student last year

1851
02:02:52,294 --> 02:02:55,654
He blamed this school
and committed suicide

1852
02:02:56,134 --> 02:02:57,734
He was only 14

1853
02:02:58,294 --> 02:02:59,814
No one was bothered

1854
02:03:00,214 --> 02:03:02,374
Because of callousness
on part of this school...

1855
02:03:02,454 --> 02:03:05,014
...a child died falling
from a moving bus

1856
02:03:05,574 --> 02:03:09,054
She was just 8 years old
No one took notice then either

1857
02:03:10,454 --> 02:03:11,965
Is this the age to die?

1858
02:03:11,990 --> 02:03:14,430
They have built this school
over such a vast area

1859
02:03:14,487 --> 02:03:16,327
3 grounds belong to the Govt

1860
02:03:16,454 --> 02:03:21,054
If one of you had raised a query...

1861
02:03:21,152 --> 02:03:23,232
...that crime could
have been stopped

1862
02:03:23,374 --> 02:03:26,711
So close down all private schools
and students will go to Govt school?

1863
02:03:26,801 --> 02:03:28,001
I didn't say that

1864
02:03:28,026 --> 02:03:29,626
Education is not a profession

1865
02:03:29,651 --> 02:03:30,691
It is a service

1866
02:03:30,894 --> 02:03:33,334
Care and concern
shown towards a student

1867
02:03:33,574 --> 02:03:35,054
I pity all parents

1868
02:03:35,527 --> 02:03:38,287
If their kids study in a school
that levies a fat fee...

1869
02:03:38,374 --> 02:03:42,214
...they will get an elevated status
in our society is their blind belief!

1870
02:03:42,294 --> 02:03:48,454
So schools take advantage
and charge an arm and a leg

1871
02:03:48,494 --> 02:03:50,014
They compete at every level

1872
02:03:50,054 --> 02:03:54,254
In sticking posters, building construction,
fees collection, ISO endorsement

1873
02:03:54,334 --> 02:03:58,614
Competition and rivalry
in every sphere and level

1874
02:03:58,725 --> 02:04:00,045
Shame on them!

1875
02:04:00,494 --> 02:04:03,494
Even in adding a teacher
to their school they compete

1876
02:04:08,414 --> 02:04:11,214
Not being blessed enough
to take a bus to school...

1877
02:04:11,614 --> 02:04:16,974
...there are still students who walk
miles to schools in our country

1878
02:04:17,214 --> 02:04:18,934
Isn't this a fact?

1879
02:04:20,214 --> 02:04:24,174
There are still students who depend on
the Govt's noon meal scheme in school

1880
02:04:25,041 --> 02:04:27,481
Wearing the uniform
the Govt gives them...

1881
02:04:28,094 --> 02:04:30,414
...there are students
who celebrate festivals

1882
02:04:32,094 --> 02:04:35,814
Haven't they excelled?
Made a name for themselves

1883
02:04:36,734 --> 02:04:39,054
What's wrong with
these students then?

1884
02:04:41,374 --> 02:04:43,214
I wish to say this here

1885
02:04:47,421 --> 02:04:49,021
Don't sell knowledge

1886
02:04:53,174 --> 02:04:55,454
Please don't barter education

1887
02:05:22,414 --> 02:05:23,494
Tell me, Maya

1888
02:05:23,494 --> 02:05:26,094
I'm held up in a very
important research work

1889
02:05:26,134 --> 02:05:27,334
Female research, huh?

1890
02:05:29,854 --> 02:05:31,694
What a surprise?!
Come and join us

1891
02:05:31,734 --> 02:05:32,574
She's just a friend

1892
02:05:32,614 --> 02:05:33,495
I waste your time, huh!

1893
02:05:33,520 --> 02:05:35,400
Why did you suddenly
show up here?

1894
02:05:35,464 --> 02:05:36,384
Why shouldn't I?

1895
02:05:36,745 --> 02:05:37,974
I understand, but-

1896
02:05:38,134 --> 02:05:39,254
My uncle is here

1897
02:05:39,869 --> 02:05:41,989
- Where are you going?
- Don't follow me

1898
02:05:42,374 --> 02:05:44,774
Reserve all these tales
for your flat nose beauty!
