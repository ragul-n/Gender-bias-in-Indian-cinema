1
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:41,709
Excuse me! Can I help you?

2
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:54,083
Goodness!
It's Juhi Chawla!

3
00:02:54,084 --> 00:02:57,958
I've to attend a shoot and
my car's broken down.

4
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:01,875
Can you give me a lift?

5
00:03:02,292 --> 00:03:06,750
I?!
Why not? Please come!

6
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:12,667
I'm very fortunate to have found you.

7
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,249
I'll never forget this favor of
yours for the rest of my life.

8
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,415
No favor at all!
This is only my duty.

9
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:23,416
They don't 'make' them
like you anymore.

10
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:33,875
Madam's arrived!
Hurry up!

11
00:03:40,667 --> 00:03:47,125
You will meet me again, won't you?

12
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,582
Why did you summon me
so suddenly, Miss Juhi?

13
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:57,999
There was no reason, really.
I just felt like meeting you.

14
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,707
It's a very romantic place, isn't it?

15
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:05,417
Yes, it is.

16
00:04:13,084 --> 00:04:16,917
There are times when I think of
the fate that would befall me...

17
00:04:17,583 --> 00:04:21,415
...if I didn't have these strong
shoulders supporting me.

18
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:26,249
Give me your word... you
will always be with me!

19
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,749
What's this you're saying, Miss Juhi?

20
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,042
Not 'Miss Juhi'... simply Juhi!

21
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:41,415
- Goodness! Govinda?!
- Who are you?

22
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:44,792
Meet Mr. Amar, Govinda.

23
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,707
Haven't I told you about him?

24
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:50,833
So, he's the one who helped
you at every step, eh?

25
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:55,249
You're a very handsome young man.

26
00:04:55,250 --> 00:05:00,292
Your tastes are improving, Juhi!

27
00:05:00,917 --> 00:05:02,415
She's feeling shy...

28
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:05,916
Listen, when you're so handsome,
why don't you try a career in films?

29
00:05:05,917 --> 00:05:10,792
I've received many offers.
But I'm being selective...

30
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:21,707
Come into my arms!

31
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:24,207
No, Gopal!
This can't be!

32
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,415
Why not?
Only because I'm poor?

33
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:29,166
And you're rich? No power
on earth can keep us apart!

34
00:05:29,167 --> 00:05:31,415
Come into my arms!

35
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:34,999
But try to understand a
woman's helplessness, Gopal!

36
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,415
This heartless world...

37
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:40,458
...this world full of enemies will not let us live.

38
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,083
- And that is the truth.
- The truth is that you love me!

39
00:05:44,084 --> 00:05:46,707
You love me and I love you.
Only this is true...

40
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:49,624
...the rest is fake! Forget it!
Come and embrace me!

41
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:55,875
Embrace her tightly, Govinda!

42
00:05:56,917 --> 00:06:02,166
- What happened?!
- I felt Shah Rukh Khan had arrived!

43
00:06:03,084 --> 00:06:06,792
Shah Rukh Khan, Sunny Deol, Govinda
...they're the ones in your life!

44
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:11,833
I'm told you're doing many films with Sunny?

45
00:06:11,834 --> 00:06:15,917
Yes.
People like us paired together.

46
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:19,958
- And you?
- I like it, too.

47
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:22,415
He's very handsome.

48
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:25,582
Why did you ask?
Are you feeling jealous?

49
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,415
I'm afraid I might kill someone!

50
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:30,666
You're upset?

51
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:34,290
I was only joking.
You're everything to me...

52
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:37,582
...you're my beloved.

53
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:42,582
It's true, Amar.
I can't live without you now.

54
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:44,749
Let's get married somewhere.

55
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:48,124
- Oh yes!
- I'll quit acting for you!

56
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,624
No!
There's no need to do that!

57
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:53,708
Go ahead and act. I'll handle
everything, including the money!

58
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:57,875
But I'll choose your lead-men.
And you must maintain a distance!

59
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,457
I treat God as witness and...

60
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:13,457
...accept you with all my heart and soul.

61
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,749
I too treat God as witness and...

62
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:21,666
...accept you with heart, soul and wealth!

63
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:25,582
Oh, Dad!
You ruined my beautiful dream!

64
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:28,749
Did you have to arrive just as
I was about to marry the heroine?

65
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,916
- Couldn't you wait for 2 minutes?
- Shut up and get up!

66
00:07:31,917 --> 00:07:33,833
He sits at the cash-counter and goes to sleep.

67
00:07:33,834 --> 00:07:36,916
Haven't I told you, Babulal, not
to let him near the cash-counter?

68
00:07:36,917 --> 00:07:39,749
How much of money does your
cash-counter have anyway?

69
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:43,499
A beggar of Bombay would have
more loose change than you do!

70
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,750
Be careful, Babulal. Don't cut his
ear off, like you did yesterday.

71
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,582
- Careful!
- How can currency notes be here?

72
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,749
He took a hundred rupees
yesterday and blew it up!

73
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,791
Not blew it up,
I 'spent' it.

74
00:07:53,792 --> 00:07:56,082
I had a haircut at
Taj Mahal's saloon yesterday.

75
00:07:56,083 --> 00:08:02,417
What?! I shave a hundred people
to put together Rs. 100/...

76
00:08:02,834 --> 00:08:06,750
...and you tip people at the Taj?!
Your hair hasn't been cut, too!

77
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:13,583
They've been cut in a style you can never tell.

78
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:16,582
Speaking a lot of English, eh?

79
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:21,041
You fool! It was with the 'change'
from this cash-counter that I...

80
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:25,792
...got you educated with;
threats and intimidation's.

81
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:28,207
I somehow got you into college, too.

82
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:31,290
But they even kicked you out of there!

83
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:34,207
I wasn't kicked out...
I quit on my own!

84
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:37,916
In fact, the Principal couldn't
understand what I said.

85
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:42,000
I have many ideas in my
brains... dying to pop out!

86
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:46,083
They're meant for the nation,
and for this generation...

87
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:48,457
And especially so, for the fathers!

88
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:52,083
Because, till the parent does not
improve, the nation cannot, too!

89
00:08:52,834 --> 00:08:55,332
The Principal's son could understand this...

90
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:56,999
...but the Principal couldn't.

91
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,249
But you...

92
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,499
I'll shave off your hair
without even applying water!

93
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,999
Oh come on, Pop!

94
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,040
If you shave my hair, people'll think you've...

95
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:08,500
- Shut up, donkey!
- Peace, father, peace...

96
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:11,666
I have a new idea.
Why don't we sell this shop?

97
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:13,040
We'll get good money.

98
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:17,542
I mean, we can open a
bangles-shop with that money.

99
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:21,500
- A bangles-shop?
- Yes. A bangles-shop.

100
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,457
Just imagine...

101
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:26,917
...we'll be surrounded by beautiful faces all day.

102
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,416
I'll make the daughter's try out the bangles...

103
00:09:30,417 --> 00:09:33,582
...while you will be busy with the mothers.

104
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:36,792
The sound of laughter...
and the meeting of eyes...

105
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:42,249
...the spread of their tresses
and the slipping of their veils!

106
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:46,834
Their pretty and delicate hands
will be in your fat, ugly paws!

107
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,040
You'll very lovingly make
them wear the bangles.

108
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:51,541
They'll gracefully make sounds of protest.

109
00:09:51,542 --> 00:09:55,749
You will, meanwhile, make noises of mischief!

110
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:59,249
I told you to take care of his ears!

111
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,416
- It's because of you!
- Because of me?!

112
00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:05,583
You're distracting him!
Get out! Get out!

113
00:10:05,584 --> 00:10:09,333
Watch it, Pop. I can't say about
you, but I command respect here.

114
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:12,874
Respect indeed!
You steal change from the counter!

115
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:16,249
You beggar!
Pretending to be a hero, eh?

116
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,207
You're angry now, father.
I'll explain it this evening.

117
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:20,708
You mean you will return in the evening?!

118
00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:23,834
No father can possibly have
such a useless son as you are!

119
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,082
Indeed there must be!

120
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:31,958
Like father, like son!

121
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:38,125
My left-eye's twitching a lot today.

122
00:10:38,709 --> 00:10:40,791
That's considered to be a good omen!

123
00:10:40,792 --> 00:10:43,082
You'll receive good news from everywhere.

124
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,999
Good news, my foot!

125
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,625
The day I became a father
was the last of my good days!

126
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,207
From that day to the present...

127
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:55,958
...my son Prem has never given
me the opportunity to be happy!

128
00:10:56,292 --> 00:10:59,375
I make the hard-earned
money, and he blows it up!

129
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:01,957
Who are you cribbing about?

130
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:04,374
My son!
But what brings you here?

131
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:07,624
Have you forgotten?
You owe the moneylender Rs.500.

132
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,374
What nonsense!

133
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:12,625
Oh yes!
The money must be paid, right?

134
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:18,749
Here's the money in
5 crisp 100-rupee notes!

135
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,040
Prem has cleaned out my money-box!

136
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:22,499
Why are you making excuses?

137
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,915
That poor chap's sitting at "Wow Wow Studios"

138
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:28,124
- "Wow Wow Studious", eh?
- Yes.

139
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:30,624
The film-bug, Johny, has bitten him real badly!

140
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,583
He's swindling my son!

141
00:11:32,584 --> 00:11:37,875
This Johny had sent my father to
Bombay, promising a career in films!

142
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,374
He still hasn't returned!

143
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:44,207
You find him standing like this in
the crowd scenes in some films.

144
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:47,542
He's conning my son, this Johny!
Where's my stick?

145
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:06,749
Wow!
What a face!

146
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,249
What a mug!

147
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,291
It's the only one of its kind!

148
00:12:11,292 --> 00:12:14,875
- What was that?
- I spat to ward off evil!

149
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,124
Well, teacher,
I'll become a star, won't it?

150
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:22,207
'Become' a star?
You're already a star, pal!

151
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:26,167
Get on with the
Production now!

152
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,583
It's already started.
I've even spoken to Amitabh.

153
00:12:29,584 --> 00:12:32,832
- What about me?
- You'll play the main lead!

154
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:35,790
He'll only play your father.

155
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:38,875
- Will he 'do'?
- Do?! It's more than done!

156
00:12:41,167 --> 00:12:45,584
Amitabh and I... the father and the son...

157
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:48,708
...and the ensuing clash between the two!

158
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:51,790
Wow!
What a scene!

159
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:55,124
Steaming hot... the tea at
"Wow Wow Productions"

160
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,708
Here you are, sir!

161
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:58,957
Get him a cold drink.

162
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:02,333
Any news of the call we were
to receive from Subhash Ghai?

163
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:05,832
Oh, that?!
It's due any moment!

164
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:09,040
I had sent your photographs to Subhash Ghai.

165
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:13,082
He needs a new 'mug' like
yours, for a film he's making.

166
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:18,750
It's called
'The Romance of Dracula"

167
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:25,082
Don't forget my role!

168
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:29,708
Yes, 'Subbu'?
It's Subhash Ghai on the line!

169
00:13:30,292 --> 00:13:31,915
Convey my respects, too, Sir!

170
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:35,417
Did you like the photographs?

171
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:39,625
What?! It's created a furors
in the whole of Bombay?!

172
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:43,707
Have people liked it so much?

173
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,874
What?!
Oh no...

174
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:50,915
Is that so?

175
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:54,000
He showed your photographs to Madhuri Dixit.

176
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:58,665
What did she say?
She'll work only with him?

177
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:02,665
And with nobody else?!
That's wonderful!

178
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,874
She even kept a snap of his with herself?!

179
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:08,874
Oh no!

180
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:17,083
There are two heroines in the film.
He's spoken to Juhi, too.

181
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:20,790
She has your address.
She'll be here to meet you.

182
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,124
Will both of them 'do'?

183
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:26,583
'Do' did you ask?!
Of course they will!

184
00:14:26,584 --> 00:14:29,707
Hey, get up!
Listen to me...

185
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:32,499
Your work is now accomplished.

186
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,500
But the respect and honor of
"Wow Wow Productions" is ruined!

187
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:40,459
The shopkeeper says that if he
does not get Rs.500/- immediately...

188
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:44,915
...he'll take away your camera from here!

189
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:47,416
I try to give the
Film Industry new faces...

190
00:14:47,417 --> 00:14:50,041
...and they want to take away my camera!

191
00:14:50,042 --> 00:14:53,124
It's only a camera, after all.
Not his good-fortune!

192
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,541
- Give away the camera!
- Wait!

193
00:14:55,542 --> 00:14:58,249
He wants to pay up!
Give it to him...

194
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,374
Throw this money in his face!

195
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:03,333
I'll do the hitting on your face!

196
00:15:03,334 --> 00:15:06,500
You're squandering away
my money on this baldie!

197
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:09,541
- He's making me a star!
- A star, eh?

198
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:11,583
He can't be a peon himself!

199
00:15:11,584 --> 00:15:15,166
I'll make you the hero in my film, too, uncle!

200
00:15:15,167 --> 00:15:20,791
You old sinner!
You've even conned my father!

201
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,082
And you're pretending to be young, eh?

202
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,582
Listen carefully...

203
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:28,250
...if you fool my foolish son any further...

204
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:32,583
...I'll put a needle in one ear
and pull it out of your other!

205
00:15:32,917 --> 00:15:36,166
I'll seal your ears, not to speak of shut mouths!

206
00:15:36,167 --> 00:15:39,459
Call me a fool if you like, but
I'll achieve something in life!

207
00:15:39,917 --> 00:15:42,749
- Hello!
- Hello, yourself!

208
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,916
Stitch-up your lips and hold the
tailors' scissors in your hand!

209
00:15:45,917 --> 00:15:47,916
- I can't do that, father!
- Can't do it?

210
00:15:47,917 --> 00:15:49,749
Would you like a begging-bowl then?

211
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:53,334
No, father...
I can see my goal ahead!

212
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,999
There's the Police Station
and the graveyard ahead!

213
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,832
Which of the two is your goal, son?

214
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,082
How do I explain?

215
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:07,375
The 'star' of my destiny, is about to shine!

216
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:18,582
Is it true that you've come
to India only to get married?

217
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:21,708
Yes.
What's so surprising?

218
00:16:22,167 --> 00:16:24,790
The only daughter of the
filthy-rich Ramgopal Bajaj...

219
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:28,417
...you've been to the whole of the world.

220
00:16:28,917 --> 00:16:31,582
But why did you choose
India to get married?

221
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:33,374
I mean, why the Indian boys.

222
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:36,750
I believe that people here
are in love with love...

223
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:41,250
I mean, they use their hearts, not their brains.

224
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,374
I too am looking for one such crazy chap.

225
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:46,999
You'll find him!
It's a country of crazy people!

226
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,333
You'll find thousands of them!

227
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,082
You haven't said something, have you?

228
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,208
- You've heard nothing, right?
- Oh nothing!

229
00:16:59,209 --> 00:17:02,708
I spoke a little.
Can something go wrong if I speak?

230
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,665
You say something, they
understand another thing...

231
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,749
...they understand little, but write a lot...

232
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,916
...they write here, it's published elsewhere...

233
00:17:09,917 --> 00:17:12,458
...whatever is published, is strange...

234
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:15,041
...and that strange something
could lead to everything strange!

235
00:17:15,042 --> 00:17:17,916
Yes...
It'll lead to something.

236
00:17:17,917 --> 00:17:20,749
Who are you, 'Miss Something'?

237
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:25,625
This is Karisma.
She's my...

238
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,957
One last question.
If you come across two boys...

239
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:34,791
...one intelligent and the other
large-hearted, whom will you choose?

240
00:17:34,792 --> 00:17:37,874
They will both be rejected.

241
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:41,000
Because she likes boys a bit large-hearted.

242
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:45,958
And intelligent, too.

243
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,791
Isn't Mr. Rustom there?

244
00:17:49,792 --> 00:17:52,582
Why does she sell stale eatables?

245
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:53,957
How are you, Amar?

246
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,333
Hasn't the strike been called off, Mr. Ahmed?

247
00:17:56,334 --> 00:17:59,082
- No, it's still continuing.
- I can't understand Govt. Policies.

248
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:02,082
For all that the leaders do, we pay for it, right?

249
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:08,500
Looks like I'll have to do something.

250
00:18:11,792 --> 00:18:14,540
The bum's arrived at last!

251
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:19,083
Are you newly employed?
Switch on the fan.

252
00:18:19,084 --> 00:18:20,749
The old thing can fall on your head at any time.

253
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,041
The Beauty from London now in India.

254
00:18:23,042 --> 00:18:24,749
In search of an eligible bachelor.

255
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,333
What a babe!
She looks like a film-star!

256
00:18:27,334 --> 00:18:30,916
She's come here to get married.
Go on and read...

257
00:18:30,917 --> 00:18:34,334
The person whom she marries
will inherit Rs.50 crores!

258
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:38,666
- Besides two factories in London.
- A diamond-business in Switzerland!

259
00:18:39,334 --> 00:18:41,083
There's a farmhouse, too!

260
00:18:41,084 --> 00:18:44,499
She's not a girl, she's a jackpot!

261
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,249
That's enough!
This news is for me!

262
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,374
- For you?!
- Of course!

263
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:52,208
- She's my heroine!
- Am I dead, then?!

264
00:18:52,209 --> 00:18:54,540
She's here in India, only for me!

265
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,582
Bravo, my boy!

266
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:59,666
Manage to trap her just once...

267
00:19:00,084 --> 00:19:03,917
...like I've trapped you... I mean,
like I've made you the hero...

268
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:08,499
...and bring her here.

269
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:13,750
Our "Wow Wow Productions" will then
become an international company.

270
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,582
After which, we'll make films only in English.

271
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:23,750
We'll need lots of money for this!

272
00:19:24,042 --> 00:19:27,582
Money can be arranged.

273
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:31,541
Sell your father's shop and his house.

274
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:36,500
Give me half the money, and
vanish with the other half.

275
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:41,042
I'll sit here and finalize the
story, set-up and music.

276
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:45,875
Only bring the girl, and become a star.

277
00:19:51,667 --> 00:19:54,124
You ungrateful wretch!

278
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:56,457
You compete with me, before my very shop!

279
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:59,083
It's not my own business, sir, it's yours!

280
00:19:59,084 --> 00:20:02,083
Amar drove everybody out of the shop, sir.

281
00:20:02,084 --> 00:20:05,292
I wonder what's happened to Amar.
He's mumbling to himself!

282
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,749
Mumbling to himself?!

283
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,124
You?!
Hats off to you!

284
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:16,084
I always knew you had it...
But so much!

285
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:21,540
Amar salutes you!

286
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:25,041
- What's going on?
- I asked you stand outside.

287
00:20:25,042 --> 00:20:27,749
- You donkey!
- Father?! It's you!

288
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,958
I was awaiting you.

289
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:35,625
You're great! You're exemplary!
There's no father like you!

290
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:38,832
You're worth worshipping.
You're supreme!

291
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:42,208
In fact, I've realized that you're not even man...

292
00:20:42,209 --> 00:20:45,540
You're a great-soul!

293
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:49,333
Great! Simply superb!
You're the Knowledgeable One!

294
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,832
At last you've heard my prayers, O Lord!

295
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,332
He did that 26 years ago!

296
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,791
Where are your feet?
I want to fall at them!

297
00:20:57,792 --> 00:21:00,249
Oh forget it, son.
But tell me...

298
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,374
...what did you suddenly discover in me?

299
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,582
You don't know your own virtues, father!

300
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:11,041
You're so great, because you
happen to be Amar's father!

301
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:15,792
I recognize you now.
Everybody will, too, in the future.

302
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:19,999
They'll say, "there goes Amar's father"

303
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,791
The cops will say that, too!

304
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,582
"There goes Amar's father"

305
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:26,124
Whenever I'm happy, you
seem to be sad, father!

306
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:29,250
What else can I do?

307
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,833
As and when you've been happy,
I've been ruined.

308
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:39,542
Do you remember, when I
first bought you a bicycle?

309
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,415
You were very happy.

310
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:46,166
But you crashed into my father's legs.

311
00:21:46,167 --> 00:21:49,500
And till the time he died, he
was known as the lame-duck.

312
00:21:50,084 --> 00:21:53,374
The next time you were happy was when...

313
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:56,999
...I bought you a firework
called Ram Bharose Rocket...

314
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,959
...you fired it, and burnt down Gupta's shop.

315
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:06,125
I'm still paying for the damages.

316
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:09,749
The third time you were happy was when...

317
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:13,207
...you pulled the string from your aunt's slip...

318
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:14,999
Forget the past!

319
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,083
I'm about to do something for which I was born!

320
00:22:19,084 --> 00:22:20,916
And what is that?

321
00:22:20,917 --> 00:22:23,374
Stop worrying and imagine...

322
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:28,166
...a cigar worth Rs.50 in your hand
instead of a 50 paise 'beedi'!

323
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:31,707
And a hat instead of this cap!

324
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:34,834
A suit and imported shoes!

325
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:42,582
- How does it feel, dad?
- Great!

326
00:22:42,583 --> 00:22:46,708
But how will all this be possible?

327
00:22:47,917 --> 00:22:51,792
- I'm going to marry a rich girl!
- Is it?

328
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,833
We'll be rich after that!

329
00:22:54,834 --> 00:22:58,916
I'll open many such shops for you.

330
00:22:58,917 --> 00:23:01,959
Then why don't you get married quickly?

331
00:23:02,667 --> 00:23:06,042
You'll have to sell off your
third-rate saloon for that...

332
00:23:06,917 --> 00:23:08,958
...and give me Rs.25,000!

333
00:23:08,959 --> 00:23:13,792
Rs. 25,000/-?!
You won't get a penny!

334
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:17,249
Get out!
Out you go!

335
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,541
Here's the money.
Return the 25 paise.

336
00:23:19,542 --> 00:23:21,791
The big noise you make for 25 paise!

337
00:23:21,792 --> 00:23:25,042
That's how I've built this house of mine!

338
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:29,875
Hi! How was your pilgrimage?
Could you see the deity?

339
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,749
There was a big crowd...

340
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:35,165
...but somehow I managed to get in.

341
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:38,207
What's the noise for? Has the
money lender's house been sold?

342
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,124
Not the moneylender's; your house's sold.

343
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:43,208
My house is sold?!
Hold this!

344
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:45,916
...who sold it?!

345
00:23:45,917 --> 00:23:48,207
But why are you dragging me?

346
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:50,582
- Keep the stuff down!
- Father!

347
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:53,041
He even screams!

348
00:23:53,042 --> 00:23:55,999
F-A-T-H-E-R!

349
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,332
- What's it, son?
- Who's this?

350
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:00,541
- He's Liyaqat.
- Liyaqat who?

351
00:24:00,542 --> 00:24:03,249
He owns a butcher's shop at Chimney Street.

352
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:07,542
You mean he'll slaughter animals
instead of using the scissors!

353
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,958
- Who are you?
- Who am I?

354
00:24:09,959 --> 00:24:14,208
I own this house.
I went out and you occupied it!

355
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:16,374
So what if you did!

356
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:19,708
So, it's you, eh?
Greetings!

357
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:21,541
When were you discharged from the hospital?

358
00:24:21,542 --> 00:24:24,583
Your son said you were being
treated for a mental disorder.

359
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:26,791
Mental disorder?
What's all this?

360
00:24:26,792 --> 00:24:29,082
You have a good son.

361
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:31,874
He said he needed money
for his father's treatment.

362
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:35,582
I gave him Rs. 22,000 for this house.

363
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:37,833
He took the money!
This is my ancestral property, Sir!

364
00:24:37,834 --> 00:24:40,374
It used to be.
It no longer is.

365
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:45,666
I'll deal with you, Prem!

366
00:24:45,959 --> 00:24:49,124
Bravo, Babulal, my loyal friend...

367
00:24:49,125 --> 00:24:51,999
...you're continuing my business even outside!

368
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,249
Not your business anymore, sir.
It's my own, this time.

369
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:58,709
Your business is closed.
Your shop has been sold!

370
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:03,041
Amar sold it to Shankar when
you went away for 2 days.

371
00:25:03,917 --> 00:25:07,125
Your son has sold this shop to me.

372
00:25:07,667 --> 00:25:10,791
I'll sell bangles in this shop now!

373
00:25:10,792 --> 00:25:15,666
He left a note for you.

374
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:21,249
Wealth worth Rs.50 crores.

375
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:24,749
The only heir.

376
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:27,416
I had seen her when she was small.

377
00:25:27,417 --> 00:25:31,041
The poor thing will see
very few days of her youth.

378
00:25:32,792 --> 00:25:35,582
She's coming to India to get married...

379
00:25:35,583 --> 00:25:39,374
It's funny how death drags
a person all over the world.

380
00:25:39,375 --> 00:25:43,833
It's good... it'll be an interesting game to play.

381
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:48,041
Ask Bhalla to take D'Souza's
place at Shanti Villa.

382
00:25:48,375 --> 00:25:50,124
Yes, sir.

383
00:25:50,125 --> 00:25:53,375
But Mr. Bhalla has a fantastic idea, sir...

384
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:57,917
...why don't we throw D'Souza
from a cliff at Junagadh...

385
00:25:58,583 --> 00:26:04,250
Keep Bhalla's ideas to yourself.

386
00:26:06,583 --> 00:26:10,875
How each card of this game has to be dealt...

387
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:14,249
...is something
I know very well.

388
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:19,082
This is the biggest game of my life.

389
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:22,166
I'll make each and every move very carefully.

390
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:26,624
None of them is any good, Robert!

391
00:26:26,625 --> 00:26:29,165
They all have some defect or the other.

392
00:26:29,166 --> 00:26:33,333
Coming to India was a waste of time!

393
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:36,249
I'm very angry with my manager, D'Souza!

394
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:39,291
How dare he present such pictures to me!

395
00:26:39,292 --> 00:26:42,833
- Where is he, by the way?
- He's no more, Madam.

396
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:44,999
Who are you?
Who's he, Robert?

397
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,082
He's our new manager.

398
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:52,542
The name's Vinod... but everybody
in town calls me Bhalla.

399
00:26:53,208 --> 00:26:57,000
- But where's D'Souza?
- Yes?

400
00:26:57,542 --> 00:26:59,457
He's 'off', Madam.

401
00:26:59,458 --> 00:27:03,041
He means D'Souza is on a long-holiday.

402
00:27:03,709 --> 00:27:06,957
Now I will make all the arrangements here.

403
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:10,458
I can't figure out anything.
Okay, you may leave now.

404
00:27:11,292 --> 00:27:15,417
Madam wants to rest, and we've got work to do.

405
00:27:22,125 --> 00:27:26,750
Oh Mother!

406
00:27:32,333 --> 00:27:34,165
It was the same again.

407
00:27:34,166 --> 00:27:36,124
Okay, please go ahead.

408
00:27:36,125 --> 00:27:38,082
- You go ahead.
- No, you go on.

409
00:27:38,083 --> 00:27:40,999
- Go ahead.
- Please do.

410
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,999
A couple of aristocratic gentlemen
lost their train in this manner.

411
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,583
Mr. Raj Kapoor has dealt
with this in detail in 'Bobby'.

412
00:27:46,584 --> 00:27:49,625
So, before the bus departs,
let me get in. You can follow me.

413
00:27:50,167 --> 00:27:55,167
Oh sure! Please do!
Come on...

414
00:27:56,083 --> 00:27:59,416
- What do you do?
- Nothing.

415
00:27:59,417 --> 00:28:02,750
I mean, I don't have to work at all.

416
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:06,749
My father has made a pile.
He's got a flourishing business.

417
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:09,040
What business?

418
00:28:09,041 --> 00:28:12,417
We're into garments.
We export garments...

419
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:16,583
Nothing is sold here... everything is exported!

420
00:28:16,584 --> 00:28:20,125
You must have heard the name...
Chaudhary and Sons!

421
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:24,584
Oh yes!
Chaudhary and Sons!

422
00:28:24,916 --> 00:28:27,541
- I've heard the name.
- You have?

423
00:28:27,542 --> 00:28:31,332
The raw material you use, is from our company.

424
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:34,584
The Mehta Group... it's a very big company.

425
00:28:35,584 --> 00:28:37,957
We give a lot of people goods on credit...

426
00:28:37,958 --> 00:28:42,208
I think Chaudhary and
Sons owes us money, too.

427
00:28:42,625 --> 00:28:45,207
That's okay.
I'll check the accounts!

428
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:48,082
"Mehta Textiles!"

429
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:51,958
"When there's no Chaudhary & Sons
how can there be Mehta Textiles?"

430
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:55,999
"Chaudhary & Sons, eh?"

431
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,082
"He looks like a worker in
an Indian-smokes factory!"

432
00:28:59,083 --> 00:29:01,874
"The bloody rotten mango!"

433
00:29:01,875 --> 00:29:04,082
Where did you buy that cap from?
From France?

434
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:06,374
Oh no, it's from Switzerland.

435
00:29:06,375 --> 00:29:09,874
I go there very often.
I like the Sunset there.

436
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:13,000
The cap's very nice, too.
It looks good on you.

437
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:17,207
"He looks like an ape with
a watermelon on his head!"

438
00:29:17,208 --> 00:29:21,958
Where did you get this jacket from?
Is it a Chaudhary & Sons product?

439
00:29:22,417 --> 00:29:24,249
- Oh no.
- It must be from America then.

440
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:26,708
Oh no,
I got it from New York.

441
00:29:26,709 --> 00:29:29,875
Oh?!
I thought it was American.

442
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:34,417
"He's as big a liar as I am"

443
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:38,790
"He looks like a monkey
retired from the circus!"

444
00:29:38,791 --> 00:29:41,541
- Where are you both going?
- To Ooty.

445
00:29:41,542 --> 00:29:44,416
- I'm going to Ooty, too.
- Is it? You too?

446
00:29:44,417 --> 00:29:50,209
- We seem to have the same goal.
- We'll have a nice trip.

447
00:30:37,167 --> 00:33:08,375
EROS

448
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:53,041
Hey! What are two cups for?
Take away one of them!

449
00:33:53,042 --> 00:33:56,167
- I'll also have tea.
- We'll share the tea, pal!

450
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,249
- It strengthens friendship.
- Does it?

451
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:00,291
Go on and drink.

452
00:34:00,292 --> 00:34:06,250
We're not sharing tea, my friend.
We're sharing love.

453
00:34:07,583 --> 00:34:11,208
What are you doing? I'll pay!
Take the money back!

454
00:34:11,209 --> 00:34:13,749
- But why?
- It's not fair. Take it back!

455
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:17,041
- It doesn't matter.
- It does. Take it back!

456
00:34:17,042 --> 00:34:18,707
- That's no friendship...
- Okay.

457
00:34:18,708 --> 00:34:21,208
- I'll take it...
- Pay for it, if you insist.

458
00:34:21,209 --> 00:34:27,375
But I'll pay the next time.
You can't always pay it!

459
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:31,250
Hey Danny boy!
Take this.

460
00:34:34,375 --> 00:34:37,625
Our friendship will set an
example in the days to come.

461
00:34:38,917 --> 00:34:43,292
Amar! Look at that... your future sister-in-law!

462
00:34:48,917 --> 00:34:51,874
Are you getting married to Madhuri Dixit?

463
00:34:51,875 --> 00:34:57,417
No, not that picture.
The one below that.

464
00:35:01,042 --> 00:35:04,665
She's not my sister-in-law,
but yours, understand?

465
00:35:04,666 --> 00:35:07,124
- Amar, our friendship...
- To hell with it!

466
00:35:07,125 --> 00:35:09,124
I'll get married to her!

467
00:35:09,125 --> 00:35:12,416
- You're doing a somersault!
- So what?

468
00:35:13,084 --> 00:35:15,999
I could tell from the look of you!
Marry Raveena, my foot!

469
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,665
Do you know how you look
in that two-penny cap?

470
00:35:18,666 --> 00:35:20,832
It looks like a watermelon on an ape's head!

471
00:35:20,833 --> 00:35:26,000
Insult?! And you?! This jacket
from the street-shops...

472
00:35:26,334 --> 00:35:29,999
...makes you look like a
retired monkey from a circus!

473
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,415
- Bloody monkey!
- Rotten-mango! I won't spare you!

474
00:35:33,416 --> 00:35:36,958
I won't spare you!

475
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,291
Careful!

476
00:35:47,292 --> 00:35:52,334
Rascals! Getting into fights?!
I'll lock you up!

477
00:35:52,792 --> 00:35:56,042
- Come on!
- We won't fight, Sir!

478
00:35:57,625 --> 00:36:00,832
Our bags are in the bus, sir!

479
00:36:00,833 --> 00:36:06,625
Peace! Peace!

480
00:36:10,583 --> 00:36:14,415
That's a good combination!

481
00:36:14,416 --> 00:36:16,582
This looks like a new
Police Station, sir.

482
00:36:16,583 --> 00:36:17,999
It's brand new!

483
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,083
- Sir, they...
- Quiet. We're talking.

484
00:36:20,084 --> 00:36:23,291
- You remain quiet.
- It's new. Built in 2 months.

485
00:36:23,292 --> 00:36:26,415
- Sir, they both...
- I know theyre Amar and Prem.

486
00:36:26,416 --> 00:36:28,999
You mustn't interfere when
there are big people talking.

487
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,083
- Quiet!
- But they were...

488
00:36:31,084 --> 00:36:34,791
Everything here is new; including the furniture!

489
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:38,208
I'm only waiting for someone to cut the 'ribbon'.

490
00:36:38,209 --> 00:36:41,291
The lock-up will have to
be inaugurated, you see!

491
00:36:41,292 --> 00:36:44,458
For that, I need a thief, a rascal, a loafer...

492
00:36:44,792 --> 00:36:49,375
...he'll inaugurate the
lock-up and I'll enjoy myself!

493
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,999
We'll take your leave now, sir.

494
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,083
It's been a pleasure meeting you.

495
00:36:56,084 --> 00:37:00,167
I'd brought them here for the inauguration, sir!

496
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:03,832
They're both ruffians.

497
00:37:03,833 --> 00:37:06,791
They were fighting it out on the streets!

498
00:37:06,792 --> 00:37:09,499
- It wasn't me. It was him!
- Yes, sir...

499
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:12,249
- No, sir! It was him.
- He started it, sir.

500
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:14,791
- He hit me first, sir.
- But who kicked first?

501
00:37:14,792 --> 00:37:17,332
- Why did you abuse me?
- Didn't you abuse me, too?

502
00:37:17,333 --> 00:37:19,958
But I didn't abuse him, sir!

503
00:37:19,959 --> 00:37:23,249
- I'll lock both of you!
- Look at my face, sir...

504
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,582
...do I look capable of fighting?

505
00:37:25,583 --> 00:37:27,749
I'm a follower of non-violence, sir.

506
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,999
He's a liar, sir.
He's being 'misled' by your looks!

507
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,791
- He thinks you're a fool!
- Fool?!

508
00:37:31,792 --> 00:37:34,791
He called you a fool!
He abused you!

509
00:37:34,792 --> 00:37:38,166
I too could have called you
a donkey? But did I? No!

510
00:37:38,167 --> 00:37:42,499
Because I know that your
appearance is deceptive.

511
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:47,374
The two of you are calling me
names in 'my' Police Station!

512
00:37:47,375 --> 00:37:50,416
Where is it...
I'll shoot you both!

513
00:37:50,667 --> 00:37:53,499
He abused you. Lock him up!
Let me go!

514
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:57,000
The Inspector's busy... to
hell with the Commissioner!

515
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:00,791
It was the Commissioner's phone!

516
00:38:00,792 --> 00:38:02,624
He's put you to trouble, sir!

517
00:38:02,625 --> 00:38:05,249
Look at his audacity!
He wants me locked up!

518
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:08,708
I know you're great and have
recognized him at the first glance!

519
00:38:09,583 --> 00:38:12,290
He's flattering you, sir!

520
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:15,249
- He's cut the ribbon, sir!
- There's less of sugar.

521
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:18,041
- Get some sugar!
- He had your tea, sir!

522
00:38:18,042 --> 00:38:19,791
My tea!

523
00:38:19,792 --> 00:38:21,582
Throw him in the cell, sir!

524
00:38:21,583 --> 00:38:23,916
He drank my tea; called me names!

525
00:38:23,917 --> 00:38:25,791
I'm fed up with both of you!

526
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:27,624
- Can we go, sir?
- N-O!

527
00:38:27,625 --> 00:38:29,457
I'll deal with both of you separately.

528
00:38:29,458 --> 00:38:31,166
With me first, sir.
I'm in a hurry.

529
00:38:31,167 --> 00:38:35,124
I'm not in a hurry, sir!

530
00:38:35,125 --> 00:38:38,582
Go away... go and sit there.
Go!

531
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:41,624
- Sit down.
- He waves his gun for nothing!

532
00:38:41,625 --> 00:38:45,332
I had picked Prem's pocket.

533
00:38:45,333 --> 00:38:48,874
Let me see how much 'bread'
the bloody millionaire has!

534
00:38:48,875 --> 00:38:51,332
The bloody ape!

535
00:38:51,333 --> 00:38:55,083
Is there nothing?

536
00:38:55,084 --> 00:38:59,916
"Shame on you, thief?!"

537
00:39:02,625 --> 00:39:04,749
Okay...
Go and sit there.

538
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:08,124
- But, sir...
- Sit down there!

539
00:39:08,125 --> 00:39:11,500
- Come here.
- Who? I?

540
00:39:12,042 --> 00:39:16,584
Come here!

541
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:23,332
Oh Mother!

542
00:39:23,333 --> 00:39:26,375
- Listen to me!
- But... sir...

543
00:39:26,875 --> 00:39:30,208
I'll show you something instead.
Come with me...

544
00:39:30,708 --> 00:39:32,874
Come with me and
look at this...

545
00:39:32,875 --> 00:39:35,249
...I've brought the thief you were looking for!

546
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:37,833
Don't let his innocent face deceive you!

547
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:41,499
He is, in fact, a dangerous criminal!

548
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,374
Now lock him up, after
charging him appropriately.

549
00:39:44,375 --> 00:39:47,457
Wait a minute...

550
00:39:47,458 --> 00:39:49,290
What are you looking at me and the snap for?

551
00:39:49,291 --> 00:39:51,916
Look at him and then at the snap!

552
00:39:51,917 --> 00:39:56,000
- That's not me, Sir!
- Shall we go?

553
00:39:56,583 --> 00:39:59,290
He's a twin-brother!

554
00:39:59,291 --> 00:40:04,708
"My father always said I'd
make a big name for myself"

555
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:08,457
Give him a big hand!

556
00:40:08,458 --> 00:40:13,291
"Our darling son will
accomplish something so big..."

557
00:40:14,875 --> 00:40:16,666
Here's your wallet.

558
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:19,916
Would I leave your wallet,
when you had picked mine?

559
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:23,208
It has 5 bucks.
You'll need the dough. Bye!

560
00:40:26,208 --> 00:40:28,916
There's no vacant room in this lodge.

561
00:40:28,917 --> 00:40:30,791
- Give me a cot then.
- There's no cot, too!

562
00:40:30,792 --> 00:40:32,958
I'll manage under the cot, too.

563
00:40:32,959 --> 00:40:35,290
- Now listen...
- Look. God's looking at you!

564
00:40:35,291 --> 00:40:38,499
Like you, I'm
His devotee too!

565
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,290
I'll die, if I don't find place to sleep today.

566
00:40:41,291 --> 00:40:44,124
Suppose I die, my blind sister...

567
00:40:44,125 --> 00:40:47,666
...and my poor mother, who's a widow...

568
00:40:47,667 --> 00:40:53,625
My blind sister and my mother who's a widow...

569
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:57,249
God! I was about to commit a grave sin!

570
00:40:57,250 --> 00:41:00,457
- Listen, I have a room upstairs.
- It'll do.

571
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:03,207
- There's a lot of stuff there...
- It will do.

572
00:41:03,208 --> 00:41:06,207
- Let's go.
- You're not a man...

573
00:41:06,208 --> 00:41:08,833
- What?!
- You're a Great Soul!

574
00:41:08,834 --> 00:41:11,290
Don't talk...
Just listen.

575
00:41:11,291 --> 00:41:14,583
Where have you brought me, Mr. Sewaram?

576
00:41:14,917 --> 00:41:17,207
Don't talk. Only listen.

577
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:19,332
- You don't snore, do you?
- Oh no.

578
00:41:19,333 --> 00:41:23,916
There's a graveyard nearby;
the dead shouldn't complain.

579
00:41:23,917 --> 00:41:26,582
Have a bath between 1 and 2 in
the morning when there's water.

580
00:41:26,583 --> 00:41:30,040
- Between 1 and 2 in the morning...
- Don't talk. Listen...

581
00:41:30,041 --> 00:41:33,541
Don't mess with the ceiling-fan.
It can fall anytime.

582
00:41:33,542 --> 00:41:36,875
And don't switch on the
lights after Sunset.

583
00:41:37,291 --> 00:41:39,624
But it's only after Sunset...

584
00:41:39,625 --> 00:41:42,749
What I mean is how will I change?

585
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,749
Why do you need lights
to change your clothes?

586
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:46,541
Take them off and go to sleep!

587
00:41:46,542 --> 00:41:48,708
- Do you plan to show something?
- Oh no!

588
00:41:48,709 --> 00:41:52,249
The fatso doesn't even allow
the lights to be switched on!

589
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:53,749
That's okay, sonny-boy...

590
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:57,582
...once you get Raveena,
there'll be lights all around.

591
00:41:57,583 --> 00:41:59,499
Lights all around.

592
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:04,750
I'm exhausted...

593
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:11,666
This is the bed...
let's sleep now.

594
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:19,332
Your Amar has arrived, Raveena.

595
00:42:19,333 --> 00:42:22,165
Prem really put me into trouble.

596
00:42:22,166 --> 00:42:25,457
But it was your love which saved me.

597
00:42:25,458 --> 00:42:28,875
There must be many donkeys
dreaming about you, Raveena.

598
00:42:29,375 --> 00:42:32,834
But when you meet Prem (Love)...

599
00:42:33,333 --> 00:42:37,542
...you'll fall head over heels in love with him!

600
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,957
My love!

601
00:42:39,958 --> 00:42:43,750
- What are you doing here?
- And what are you doing here?

602
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,458
I think the idiot's dead.
His spirit is roaming...

603
00:42:48,834 --> 00:42:50,541
It must be your spirit.

604
00:42:50,542 --> 00:42:52,916
- Get lost!
- You get lost!

605
00:42:52,917 --> 00:42:56,709
- Go... get lost... damn you...
- Go... get lost... Oh mother!

606
00:42:57,750 --> 00:43:00,541
Hey, Amar...
How are you?

607
00:43:00,542 --> 00:43:03,541
- 'First Class'. How are you?
- 'Tip Top'!

608
00:43:03,542 --> 00:43:06,625
- Y-O-U?!
- Y-O-U?!

609
00:43:06,916 --> 00:43:08,374
- What are you doing here?
- How about you?

610
00:43:08,375 --> 00:43:10,249
- I came here first!
- By conning me!

611
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:13,040
- You picked my pocket first!
- You did!

612
00:43:13,041 --> 00:43:14,499
What did you say?!

613
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:19,417
What's going on?
Fighting and arson in my lodge?!

614
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:23,041
Not fighting!
This is affection!

615
00:43:23,709 --> 00:43:29,000
We were separated in our childhood.
Which explains the affection!

616
00:43:29,333 --> 00:43:34,166
Lots of love!
Why did you get separated?

617
00:43:34,584 --> 00:43:38,250
It wasn't me... we were separated
in the fair held at Kumbh!

618
00:43:39,292 --> 00:43:42,624
It was because he left my hand.
Why did you do that?

619
00:43:42,625 --> 00:43:46,792
Come and embrace me, brother...

620
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,624
Never leave me now!

621
00:43:51,625 --> 00:43:57,167
You've become very fat!
Naughty boy!

622
00:44:07,916 --> 00:44:11,165
Make up for the lost years.
Your love and affection...

623
00:44:11,166 --> 00:44:14,082
...reminds me of that episode of
Raman and Sagar's "Ramayan"...

624
00:44:14,083 --> 00:44:17,625
...in which Lord Rama and Bharat were united.

625
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,791
Not two... take away one cup of tea...

626
00:44:42,792 --> 00:44:45,124
...we'll share the tea.
It'll strengthen our friendship.

627
00:44:45,125 --> 00:44:46,749
Keep it there!

628
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:49,832
What friendship?
To hell with it!

629
00:44:49,833 --> 00:44:51,791
I'm telling you
Raveena's not for you.

630
00:44:51,792 --> 00:44:53,416
You don't understand and instead get angry!

631
00:44:53,417 --> 00:44:55,624
Be a good boy and return to Bhopal.

632
00:44:55,625 --> 00:44:57,583
You're threatening me!

633
00:44:57,584 --> 00:45:00,332
Do you see these muscles?
I'll crush you!

634
00:45:00,333 --> 00:45:03,624
Flexing muscles, idiot?!
Raveena's mine! Hear that!

635
00:45:03,625 --> 00:45:05,207
Yes.
She's your sister-in-law.

636
00:45:05,208 --> 00:45:07,124
What are you fighting for?

637
00:45:07,125 --> 00:45:10,166
The deserving person from the trio will get her.

638
00:45:10,167 --> 00:45:13,082
- Who's the third?
- Who's the third, punk?

639
00:45:13,083 --> 00:45:15,249
- I'm there, too.
- You?!

640
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:17,957
How dare you?!
How could you even imagine!

641
00:45:17,958 --> 00:45:19,374
Just as you did!

642
00:45:19,375 --> 00:45:21,666
That's enough.
I've got a nasty temper!

643
00:45:21,667 --> 00:45:25,082
- And then? What will you do?
- I... I'll think...

644
00:45:25,083 --> 00:45:27,040
There's no time to waste.

645
00:45:27,041 --> 00:45:30,958
Do you think we're the only aspirants here?

646
00:45:31,333 --> 00:45:34,624
Go there and take a look...
there are thousands there!

647
00:45:34,625 --> 00:45:38,250
There's a big queue. Tokens are
being distributed for the interview.

648
00:45:38,791 --> 00:45:40,915
I had to wait for 20 hours to even get a token!

649
00:45:40,916 --> 00:45:44,833
Oh Mother! No. 717...
Raveena's in great demand!

650
00:45:45,333 --> 00:45:47,708
It's disgusting...

651
00:45:47,709 --> 00:45:50,790
...there's a limit to unemployment.
Youngsters ought to be ashamed!

652
00:45:50,791 --> 00:45:54,166
One rich girl and everybody's
make a beeline for her!

653
00:45:54,167 --> 00:45:56,166
Even though they lack in looks and talent!

654
00:45:56,167 --> 00:45:58,832
You're one of us, too!

655
00:45:58,833 --> 00:46:00,499
My case is different.

656
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,749
We'll have to do something to begin with.

657
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:07,500
We'll have to ruin the chances of all
those who have assembled here.

658
00:46:08,041 --> 00:46:10,541
After that, the deserving person will get her.

659
00:46:10,542 --> 00:46:14,124
The deserving will surely get her!

660
00:46:14,125 --> 00:46:16,207
Okay.
Let's go.

661
00:46:16,208 --> 00:46:19,374
Let's go...
I already have her.

662
00:46:19,375 --> 00:46:22,667
You illiterate, ill-mannered, insolent donkey!

663
00:46:23,584 --> 00:46:25,082
You dare ask us for our identity!

664
00:46:25,083 --> 00:46:29,916
Introduce us, Mr. Dhamru!

665
00:46:30,208 --> 00:46:33,333
This is the Nawab Noorali Nizamuddin
Barkatali, alias Bade Miyan.

666
00:46:33,584 --> 00:46:37,584
And this is Ameerali, Ashleelali,
Asli, alias Chhote Miyan.

667
00:46:38,125 --> 00:46:41,790
And I am Damru Tehmurlang Turk.

668
00:46:41,791 --> 00:46:44,666
So many names?
Where are the rest of them?

669
00:46:44,667 --> 00:46:46,790
They're their names.

670
00:46:46,791 --> 00:46:50,625
- Who are you?
- I'm her Sr. Executive Manager.

671
00:46:51,083 --> 00:46:53,416
- And I'm the Junior.
- They appear to be servants.

672
00:46:53,417 --> 00:46:55,207
Their faces say it all.

673
00:46:55,208 --> 00:47:02,500
- We can't see our little girl.
- I'm looking for her, too.

674
00:47:03,042 --> 00:47:05,374
Who's the 'little one'?
Raveena Bajaj has a function here.

675
00:47:05,375 --> 00:47:08,624
She's the 'little one'.
She used to play in my lap!

676
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:10,665
And I used to carry her on my shoulder!

677
00:47:10,666 --> 00:47:14,334
- She used to call me 'Uncle'...
- And I was younger uncle...

678
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:16,749
Oh, so you're her uncle!

679
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,874
You've come at the right time.
Today she...

680
00:47:18,875 --> 00:47:22,124
...she will choose her bridegroom.

681
00:47:22,125 --> 00:47:25,041
- Bridegroom?
- There are many suitors here...

682
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:27,957
Because of which we
arranged the function here.

683
00:47:27,958 --> 00:47:30,583
- Idiot! Where are the suitors?
- Over there!

684
00:47:30,584 --> 00:47:33,416
Take me there...
Shame on them!

685
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:35,333
Look, there they are!

686
00:47:35,334 --> 00:47:39,666
Hey young men!
Come here and listen to me!

687
00:47:41,417 --> 00:47:44,416
Just forget the idea of
getting married to Raveena!

688
00:47:44,417 --> 00:47:46,749
Because she was engaged
when she was a child!

689
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:48,082
To Prem Singh, that is!

690
00:47:48,083 --> 00:47:51,916
- Go away all of you. Get lost!
- No!

691
00:47:52,417 --> 00:47:55,124
We will not leave!
We will not go!

692
00:47:55,125 --> 00:47:58,417
- Deal with them, Dhumro!
- As you wish, Sir!

693
00:48:03,542 --> 00:48:08,124
Go and bring Raveena here!
Come on! Hurry up!

694
00:48:08,125 --> 00:48:11,665
- Congratulations.
- To you, too.

695
00:48:11,666 --> 00:48:13,333
There are two elderly gentlemen outside.

696
00:48:13,334 --> 00:48:17,875
They claim that they've had
your father playing in their laps!

697
00:48:18,584 --> 00:48:21,583
They also claim that you
used to call them 'Uncle'.

698
00:48:21,584 --> 00:48:25,584
- Uncle?
- Recognize me? I'm your Uncle!

699
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:29,791
You're scaring the girl!
Come to me, dear...

700
00:48:30,167 --> 00:48:33,041
...do you remember, dear?
We used to go for those walks?

701
00:48:33,042 --> 00:48:35,665
Remember that sweet-meats shop?
Those sweets?

702
00:48:35,666 --> 00:48:39,375
And also the zoo with all those animals...

703
00:48:41,208 --> 00:48:42,999
Step aside!

704
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,125
Come and embrace your uncle!
Come dear, come to me!

705
00:48:46,917 --> 00:48:49,749
She's embraced you enough
when she was a kid.

706
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:51,790
But I was her favorite!

707
00:48:51,791 --> 00:48:54,833
My sweet, honey, darling!

708
00:48:55,958 --> 00:48:59,917
He seems to be hungry!
Give him something to eat!

709
00:49:00,583 --> 00:49:02,249
Oh no! I'm not hungry!

710
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:07,125
What are you looking back for, all the time?

711
00:49:07,459 --> 00:49:10,082
The old man suffers fits of epilepsy!

712
00:49:10,083 --> 00:49:12,249
And clings to anyone who comes before him!

713
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:17,083
Is that so? You have those sweets.
I'll go take a look.

714
00:49:17,417 --> 00:49:20,790
Sweet-meats?!
They're nice indeed!

715
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:24,541
You're more beautiful than
any of your photographs!

716
00:49:24,917 --> 00:49:28,208
Which is why I've fixed your
marriage with Amar Singh.

717
00:49:28,209 --> 00:49:30,832
- Who's Amar Singh?
- Don't you know Amar Singh?!

718
00:49:30,833 --> 00:49:33,749
- No.
- Amar Singh is the handsome youth...

719
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:37,167
...who makes girl swoon when
he walks through their streets!

720
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:41,083
- They really do.
- How can I believe you?

721
00:49:41,459 --> 00:49:45,209
You ill-mannered wretch!
You doubt my words!

722
00:49:45,708 --> 00:49:49,917
People still don't get married in
Aligarh without consulting me!

723
00:49:50,459 --> 00:49:53,749
Not a single marriage!
That's my experience!

724
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:59,291
My hair hasn't turned gray out
of inexperience, you know!

725
00:50:03,292 --> 00:50:06,458
There are many tales revolving
around me and my brother.

726
00:50:06,459 --> 00:50:10,209
We've done everything since
the Independence of India.

727
00:50:12,042 --> 00:50:14,458
So, you know Raveena
since she was a child, right?

728
00:50:14,459 --> 00:50:18,541
Not only our darling Raveena,
I know her father too!

729
00:50:18,875 --> 00:50:20,749
What else do you know?

730
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:24,500
When Raveena sat in my
lap, she just wouldn't get up!

731
00:50:24,958 --> 00:50:29,125
She used to pester me for things
to eat and to roam around the city!

732
00:50:29,666 --> 00:50:32,291
Which is why you even chose
the bridegroom for her, right?

733
00:50:32,292 --> 00:50:34,999
What a boy! He's one in a million!
Prem Singh!

734
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,209
- But he said it was Amar Singh.
- The old man's getting senile!

735
00:50:38,583 --> 00:50:41,374
Neither can he see nor hear properly!

736
00:50:41,375 --> 00:50:47,208
What can we do for you?

737
00:50:52,417 --> 00:50:56,541
Just tell me where the other old gentleman is.

738
00:50:57,042 --> 00:50:59,416
He's gone to sleep.

739
00:50:59,417 --> 00:51:02,582
I'm not feeling very good, too...

740
00:51:02,583 --> 00:51:05,041
...I think I too will
lie down for sometime.

741
00:51:05,042 --> 00:51:07,665
We've made all the
arrangements for you to lie down!

742
00:51:07,666 --> 00:51:12,792
- Where's my cane?
- Cane? Here it is!

743
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:18,792
You should have let me know,
if your disguise had come off.

744
00:51:19,334 --> 00:51:22,333
I too would have fled with you.

745
00:51:22,334 --> 00:51:25,124
May even my enemies not
have friends like you are!

746
00:51:25,125 --> 00:51:28,333
So, return to Bhopal.
This is simply not your ball-game.

747
00:51:28,334 --> 00:51:31,249
What are two cups for?
Take away one!

748
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:33,665
We'll share the tea.
It'll strengthen our friendship.

749
00:51:33,666 --> 00:51:35,916
Keep it there and scoot!

750
00:51:35,917 --> 00:51:37,916
To hell with your friendship!

751
00:51:37,917 --> 00:51:40,832
You always get me beaten up!
You think I'm a fool, eh?

752
00:51:40,833 --> 00:51:44,041
- I...
- Freeze!

753
00:51:44,042 --> 00:51:45,916
One punch and you'll break to pieces!

754
00:51:45,917 --> 00:51:48,083
Only my back is broken...
Not my elbow!

755
00:51:48,084 --> 00:51:49,957
- Threatening me with your elbow?
- No...

756
00:51:49,958 --> 00:51:52,415
What are you fighting for?

757
00:51:52,416 --> 00:51:55,750
There are only the two of you now.
I've already quit the race.

758
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:59,333
When were you in the race?
You can't be compared with me!

759
00:51:59,334 --> 00:52:02,374
I was in the race, too!

760
00:52:02,375 --> 00:52:05,917
But I forgot all about
romance, after seeing his fate.

761
00:52:06,334 --> 00:52:11,042
I'm happy as I am. But I'll always
help you. Till I breathe my last!

762
00:52:11,792 --> 00:52:15,249
Learn a thing or two from him!
Look how wise he's being!

763
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:17,499
Henceforth, you too start helping me, okay?

764
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:20,333
You'll see it, God will never forgive you!

765
00:52:20,334 --> 00:52:23,083
Why don't you people take turns in trying?

766
00:52:23,084 --> 00:52:26,083
That's a good idea!
I'll make the first attempt.

767
00:52:26,084 --> 00:52:29,041
First get into the position of making an attempt!

768
00:52:29,042 --> 00:52:30,957
You'll suffer the consequences of my curse!

769
00:52:30,958 --> 00:52:35,084
- Have you seen the film 'Sholay'?
- Yes. At least 10 times!

770
00:52:35,708 --> 00:52:38,166
- His father wrote it.
- Don't drag him into this!

771
00:52:38,167 --> 00:52:45,084
In 'Sholay', Amitabh and Dharmendra
tossed a coin to decide everything.

772
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:48,166
You do that, too. The winner
will make the first attempt.

773
00:52:48,167 --> 00:52:51,124
Yes!
Now, that's a good idea!

774
00:52:51,125 --> 00:52:53,083
We'll leave it to the toss.

775
00:52:53,084 --> 00:52:55,916
Winners are 'Conquerors'
losers are apes!

776
00:52:55,917 --> 00:52:59,249
Now listen...
Heads I win, Tails you lose.

777
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:01,749
- Is that okay?
- No! Reverse that!

778
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:04,874
Okay...
Tails you lose, Heads I win.

779
00:53:04,875 --> 00:53:08,708
Here goes the coin... and the winner...

780
00:53:09,167 --> 00:53:12,083
Tails you lose,
Heads I win!

781
00:53:12,084 --> 00:53:15,374
Here I come, Raveena!

782
00:53:15,375 --> 00:53:18,875
If he wins Heads, you win Tails.
You haven't lost! You've won!

783
00:53:19,416 --> 00:53:22,374
Oh yes!
I'm the conqueror!

784
00:53:22,375 --> 00:53:24,374
But he's made an ape out of you!

785
00:53:24,375 --> 00:53:27,582
My plan will take me straight
to the girl's bedroom!

786
00:53:27,583 --> 00:53:29,083
- To the bedroom?
- Absolutely!

787
00:53:29,084 --> 00:53:32,667
Once you reach the bedroom, it
won't take much to reach her heart.

788
00:53:33,042 --> 00:53:35,540
- Oh no!
- But there's a problem.

789
00:53:35,541 --> 00:53:38,083
- The stick.
- Stick?

790
00:53:38,084 --> 00:53:41,833
The girl must be somehow
made to give me the stick.

791
00:53:42,416 --> 00:53:45,707
- But why will she hit you?
- Because I'll worry her.

792
00:53:45,708 --> 00:53:49,333
- So, you'll worry her, too?!
- Yes, a lot...

793
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:52,959
- But why?
- Because I want her to hit me.

794
00:53:53,291 --> 00:53:54,999
Will you quietly get hit?

795
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,582
- With pleasure.
- Don't worry. I'll supply the stick.

796
00:53:58,583 --> 00:54:03,208
- Really?

797
00:54:38,583 --> 00:58:10,917
EROS

798
00:59:03,375 --> 00:59:06,207
She's killed him!
Is anybody there?!

799
00:59:06,208 --> 00:59:08,416
No! I haven't done this!

800
00:59:08,417 --> 00:59:10,916
I saw you doing it!

801
00:59:10,917 --> 00:59:13,249
It was your hand!
It was your club!

802
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:16,417
One hit and the poor chap died!

803
00:59:16,875 --> 00:59:19,749
Listen to me!
The club kept coming before me...

804
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:23,416
...and he continued misbehaving.
I held myself from hitting him...

805
00:59:23,417 --> 00:59:25,416
But you struck at last!

806
00:59:25,417 --> 00:59:27,957
Listen! Please don't call the Police!

807
00:59:27,958 --> 00:59:31,125
- Who else can I call?
- He's breathing! He'll get up.

808
00:59:31,583 --> 00:59:33,291
How will the poor chap wake up?

809
00:59:33,292 --> 00:59:35,749
Itll take four people to haul him up now.

810
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:38,834
He's left the world for good!
He died at a young age!

811
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:44,000
No! Don't call the Police!
I'll get him cured!

812
00:59:44,834 --> 00:59:49,375
Please give me a hand!

813
00:59:55,584 --> 00:59:58,958
Where am I? Who am I?
Who are you people?

814
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:03,584
Where have I come from?
What's my name?

815
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,833
The poor chap's struck by amnesia!

816
01:00:06,834 --> 01:00:10,333
All this happened because
of the blow you gave him!

817
01:00:12,125 --> 01:00:14,040
Why do you keep scolding me?!

818
01:00:14,041 --> 01:00:17,583
Why is she crying? What blow?
Which blow?

819
01:00:17,584 --> 01:00:19,249
I can't understand anything.

820
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:22,292
Won't you people tell me?
You tell me! You'll have to!

821
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:27,624
What have you done, Raveena?

822
01:00:27,625 --> 01:00:30,583
You too scold me?!
I won't speak to anyone!

823
01:00:30,584 --> 01:00:32,541
I'll have to call the police now!

824
01:00:32,542 --> 01:00:35,457
Don't call the police.
Please!

825
01:00:35,458 --> 01:00:38,457
It was I who hit him,
I'll have him treated too.

826
01:00:38,458 --> 01:00:41,792
Till he recovers his memory,
I'll keep him here. Care for him!

827
01:00:42,625 --> 01:00:45,667
You're so nice...
So beautiful...

828
01:00:46,208 --> 01:00:48,416
...how much you care for me.

829
01:00:48,417 --> 01:00:51,416
What's your name, Miss Raveena?

830
01:00:51,417 --> 01:00:54,457
It's necessary for you to recover soon.

831
01:00:54,458 --> 01:00:57,875
- What's the hurry?
- Mr. Bajaj is arriving tomorrow.

832
01:00:58,584 --> 01:01:02,750
I've made a mistake, sir...
I forgot to tell you.

833
01:01:03,125 --> 01:01:06,916
Mr. Bajaj called from London
to say he's coming next week.

834
01:01:07,625 --> 01:01:10,666
Father's funny too!
He's left us here all alone.

835
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:13,833
There's some problem everyday.
He's not bothered about us!

836
01:01:14,208 --> 01:01:16,541
I think so, too.
He doesn't care for you.

837
01:01:16,542 --> 01:01:19,957
What kind of a father is he?
He should've been here. With you.

838
01:01:19,958 --> 01:01:23,333
Just think; two girls, poor things,
all alone in a strange city...

839
01:01:23,709 --> 01:01:28,917
Robert, dial his number.
I'll talk to him.

840
01:01:29,041 --> 01:01:35,375
Who am I?
Where am I?

841
01:01:41,333 --> 01:01:44,207
Who is this?

842
01:01:44,208 --> 01:01:47,709
You seemed to be pretty
decent in your younger days.

843
01:01:49,875 --> 01:01:51,541
You were fooled, weren't you?

844
01:01:51,542 --> 01:01:55,874
That's the game!
He's my brother, my twin-brother.

845
01:01:55,875 --> 01:01:57,583
Mr. Ramgopal Bajaj.

846
01:01:57,584 --> 01:02:03,708
My name's not Teja... it's Shyamgopal Bajaj.

847
01:02:05,208 --> 01:02:06,957
He was my father's pet.

848
01:02:06,958 --> 01:02:10,749
My old man used to love him a lot.

849
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:13,416
I wonder what spell he had them under...

850
01:02:13,417 --> 01:02:16,749
...but he was always considered to
be Lord Rama and I was Ravana.

851
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:22,375
I decided then that I'd knock off
my father and clear his cards, too.

852
01:02:23,083 --> 01:02:25,040
And I gave it a good try.

853
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:29,584
As it happened, our clerk,
Harishankar, spilled the beans.

854
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:34,417
But it was good. He used to bore
me with a lot of holy mumbo-jumbo.

855
01:02:35,125 --> 01:02:40,083
I was sentenced to 10 years
of imprisonment in that case.

856
01:02:40,625 --> 01:02:42,666
I was in jail for 10 years!

857
01:02:42,667 --> 01:02:45,416
When I came out, the
whole scene had changed.

858
01:02:45,417 --> 01:02:48,709
He had gone away to London
and multiplied his 1 crore to 30!

859
01:02:49,208 --> 01:02:52,541
But sir, why didn't you go to London, too?

860
01:02:52,542 --> 01:02:56,459
How could I go to London?
The police is on my trail.

861
01:02:57,584 --> 01:03:02,083
Mogambo's nephew is hunting
me for the 5 lakhs I swindled.

862
01:03:02,459 --> 01:03:05,749
Don't I want to see London?
But how could I go?

863
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:10,500
But now the bad days are behind us.

864
01:03:11,083 --> 01:03:14,207
That girl is his daughter!

865
01:03:14,208 --> 01:03:17,374
Let him enter my domain just once...

866
01:03:17,375 --> 01:03:20,584
...I will not be defeated
like Ravana was!

867
01:03:21,083 --> 01:03:24,708
I'll 'lay out' all his cards!

868
01:03:26,375 --> 01:03:29,583
A profit of millions for only one murder?!

869
01:03:29,584 --> 01:03:32,999
Leave that to me, Mr. Teja.

870
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:37,167
I'll kill him in a manner he
won't even realize he's dead.

871
01:03:37,833 --> 01:03:41,125
But you will kill him only when
he comes to India, won't you?

872
01:03:41,916 --> 01:03:45,458
But when will he come to India?
When will he?

873
01:03:45,459 --> 01:03:48,500
His daughter's here, sir.
He'll certainly come, too!

874
01:03:49,459 --> 01:03:52,875
Good!
That's very good!

875
01:03:54,708 --> 01:04:00,708
Kill his daughter then!

876
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:04,875
- Who's that? Miss Raveena?
- What's it, Tilu?

877
01:04:05,417 --> 01:04:10,708
When I got up this morning,
I saw that I had lost my eye-sight.

878
01:04:11,334 --> 01:04:16,207
Where are we, by the way?

879
01:04:16,208 --> 01:04:19,416
The world seemed strange
when I lost my memory...

880
01:04:19,417 --> 01:04:22,833
...and now it's turning dark,
when I've lost my eye-sight.

881
01:04:23,625 --> 01:04:25,333
Get a grip on yourself, Tilu.

882
01:04:25,334 --> 01:04:28,375
Control, my foot!
Excuse me... step aside!

883
01:04:34,750 --> 01:04:36,458
Leave me! Leave me!

884
01:04:36,459 --> 01:04:38,458
- No!
- Let me go!

885
01:04:38,459 --> 01:04:40,333
I have right to live!

886
01:04:40,334 --> 01:04:44,417
- What's going on here?
- He's committing suicide.

887
01:04:44,833 --> 01:04:48,166
Oh?!
There's someone to see you, Madam.

888
01:04:48,167 --> 01:04:50,207
Let go of me!
Let me go, I said!

889
01:04:50,208 --> 01:04:54,416
Oh God!

890
01:04:54,417 --> 01:04:56,583
- Who are you?
- What is it?

891
01:04:56,584 --> 01:05:00,375
Please don't worry.
I'm a Police Doctor.

892
01:05:00,916 --> 01:05:03,832
Just as the police smells out the criminals...

893
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:07,375
...I reach the patients with the scent I get, too.

894
01:05:12,791 --> 01:05:17,458
Old?

895
01:05:17,875 --> 01:05:22,750
Khurana... not Purana (Old)...
Dr Prem Khurana!

896
01:05:24,375 --> 01:05:27,832
I have information that there's
a patient hiding in your house.

897
01:05:27,833 --> 01:05:31,207
I didn't do it deliberately...
I was only standing with the club...

898
01:05:31,208 --> 01:05:33,749
I know that!
But where is he?

899
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:36,041
How should we have known
that he'd lose his memory?

900
01:05:36,042 --> 01:05:38,333
Tilu's eye-sight is failing him, too.

901
01:05:38,334 --> 01:05:41,458
- Tilu?
- Yes, we found him at the Lake...

902
01:05:41,459 --> 01:05:43,790
...so we call him Tilu.

903
01:05:43,791 --> 01:05:47,374
He'll see everything clearly
when he catches sight of me!

904
01:05:47,375 --> 01:05:49,416
Hasn't he recognized me?!

905
01:05:49,417 --> 01:05:52,665
- Will he get back his memory then?
- Of the last seven births!

906
01:05:52,666 --> 01:05:55,750
- I know this ailment well.
- Who's he, Miss Raveena?

907
01:05:56,250 --> 01:05:57,874
He's a doctor.

908
01:05:57,875 --> 01:06:00,917
I'm a pretty old hand.

909
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:04,041
He seems more like a carpenter!

910
01:06:04,042 --> 01:06:06,749
- My father was a carpenter.
- I don't want him treating me.

911
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:09,082
Give me poison instead.
I'd rather die.

912
01:06:09,083 --> 01:06:12,374
I'll fulfill that wish too.
Leave her hand.

913
01:06:12,375 --> 01:06:14,916
- No.
- Let go of her hand!

914
01:06:14,917 --> 01:06:18,665
He has a contagious disease!

915
01:06:18,666 --> 01:06:21,874
Everything will be okay, now that I've come.

916
01:06:21,875 --> 01:06:24,874
The name's Prem...
Prem Khurana.

917
01:06:24,875 --> 01:06:30,458
See how I set him right now.

918
01:06:47,209 --> 01:06:49,624
Our friendship?! Have you forgotten?
I'm your friend, after all!

919
01:06:49,625 --> 01:06:51,582
- To hell with it!
- I feel like strangling you!

920
01:06:51,583 --> 01:06:55,334
I'll give you an injection meant
for horses. You'll neigh, too!

921
01:06:55,958 --> 01:06:59,416
What are you discussing with him?

922
01:06:59,417 --> 01:07:04,834
- That's very confidential.
- Confidential?

923
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,374
Distractions! Tilu!
The treatment!

924
01:07:15,375 --> 01:07:16,749
What's all this?

925
01:07:16,750 --> 01:07:19,749
You can understand this, Miss.
I don't want my memory.

926
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:21,874
I'll manage with what little I have.

927
01:07:21,875 --> 01:07:25,041
This is a disease which spreads at his touch!

928
01:07:25,042 --> 01:07:28,750
To treat him, you must
keep him away from food.

929
01:07:29,334 --> 01:07:33,042
Will he recover his memory if
he's hit on the same spot again?

930
01:07:33,375 --> 01:07:35,457
- That's possible.
- Oh no!

931
01:07:35,458 --> 01:07:37,832
Can we give him another blow then?

932
01:07:37,833 --> 01:07:45,083
He must be hit on the same spot.
A hard blow!

933
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:49,042
I'll hit him! I'll succeed if
I give him two or four blows!

934
01:07:49,666 --> 01:07:52,540
I've had it!

935
01:07:52,541 --> 01:07:55,749
You hit him earlier, Miss Raveena.
Let me try now.

936
01:07:55,750 --> 01:08:00,541
You're going to get a sound thrashing!

937
01:08:06,084 --> 01:08:08,083
Leave this to me.

938
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:12,042
Only tell me when and how
many blows he must be given.

939
01:08:12,583 --> 01:08:13,749
Can I try, sir?

940
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:16,917
Two and two...
Four in all!

941
01:08:22,708 --> 01:08:28,125
Everybody will be given a fair chance.

942
01:08:29,084 --> 01:08:31,582
Give him two blows, when he gets up.

943
01:08:31,583 --> 01:08:34,999
Keep giving him two blows, as
and when he wants to sleep.

944
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:40,208
I get up before everybody else does, sir.

945
01:08:58,875 --> 01:09:00,624
There's nothing to worry about, is there Doctor?

946
01:09:00,625 --> 01:09:03,792
I've given him the injection.
He needs blessings and blows now.

947
01:09:04,292 --> 01:09:05,791
Don't forget to keep hitting him.

948
01:09:05,792 --> 01:09:08,166
Till he recovers,
I'll stay here.

949
01:09:08,167 --> 01:09:11,624
- An unwanted guest?
- That's how I am.

950
01:09:11,625 --> 01:09:13,916
Accommodate him in the outhouse, Robert.

951
01:09:13,917 --> 01:09:16,707
Not there; In this house, near your room.

952
01:09:16,708 --> 01:09:19,916
- Give me the room opposite mine.
- Is there nothing adjoining?

953
01:09:19,917 --> 01:09:26,292
- There is. Near mine.
- Opposite will do. Thanks.

954
01:09:28,541 --> 01:09:31,083
The doctor's very nice. Isn't he?

955
01:09:31,084 --> 01:09:33,582
Gone crazy over him, have you?

956
01:09:33,583 --> 01:09:37,916
Hurry up...
We've to give Tilu some blows.

957
01:09:37,917 --> 01:09:41,209
- This is a unique bouquet, Robert.
- It's beautiful, sir.

958
01:09:41,583 --> 01:09:44,999
- I've kept a time-bomb in it.
- You hold it.

959
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,832
It's time for Raveena to come out.

960
01:09:47,833 --> 01:09:52,292
When she smilingly picks it up,
it'll blast at the appointed time.

961
01:09:52,750 --> 01:09:56,291
And that will be the
last 'time' of her life.

962
01:09:56,292 --> 01:09:58,999
It's time for you to keep the bouquet.

963
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,374
But if I keep it, the police will...

964
01:10:01,375 --> 01:10:05,291
Don't worry, Robert.
I've written Tilu's name on it.

965
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:09,500
Tilu will go to prison, and Raveena to heaven.

966
01:10:10,042 --> 01:10:13,625
It's like killing two people using the same arrow!

967
01:10:13,875 --> 01:10:17,458
It's like killing two, with one arrow.

968
01:10:18,250 --> 01:10:21,333
Go now. There's very little
time in the time-bomb left.

969
01:10:21,708 --> 01:10:26,375
Have you switched it on?!

970
01:10:30,375 --> 01:10:34,707
- Is the car ready, Robert?
- No! Yes... it is!

971
01:10:34,708 --> 01:10:39,041
No!

972
01:10:39,042 --> 01:10:42,167
I've kept the time-bomb on the table, sir.

973
01:10:42,708 --> 01:10:44,415
Raveena will be out soon.

974
01:10:44,416 --> 01:10:48,500
Good-timing is okay, but
when will good times come?

975
01:10:48,959 --> 01:10:52,374
Good times will be upon us very soon...

976
01:10:52,375 --> 01:10:56,999
What's that?
Flowers?!

977
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,208
For Raveena? From Tilu?!

978
01:10:59,209 --> 01:11:01,666
You dare do this!
I'll put my name there...

979
01:11:01,667 --> 01:11:06,541
What's going on, Doctor?
Who are you giving the bouquet to?

980
01:11:07,416 --> 01:11:10,457
And what's this behind you?
What are you hiding?

981
01:11:10,458 --> 01:11:13,749
For Raveena, is it?
...Tilu!

982
01:11:13,750 --> 01:11:15,415
Your name instead of mine, eh?

983
01:11:15,416 --> 01:11:18,666
Don't mess with me...
Mr. Tilu!

984
01:11:18,667 --> 01:11:20,582
Who's Tilu?
I'll give you a kick!

985
01:11:20,583 --> 01:11:22,415
What's up?
What's happening, Tilu?

986
01:11:22,416 --> 01:11:26,250
I brought you flowers, but the
doctor wants to beat me up!

987
01:11:27,167 --> 01:11:30,374
- Well, doctor?
- I brought the flowers!

988
01:11:30,375 --> 01:11:31,999
- I brought them!
- I did!

989
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:37,083
- I brought them!
- I did!

990
01:11:56,667 --> 01:11:58,290
Start counting, Robert.

991
01:11:58,291 --> 01:12:02,958
Have the good times arrived?

992
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:08,125
- You threw it!
- You did!

993
01:12:22,208 --> 01:12:24,041
What you mean to say is that...

994
01:12:24,042 --> 01:12:27,458
...you couldn't play the 'game'
because of those two clowns.

995
01:12:28,333 --> 01:12:30,874
Very good.

996
01:12:30,875 --> 01:12:35,041
I've got great satisfaction.

997
01:12:35,042 --> 01:12:38,249
Sorry, sir.
We made a mistake my oversight.

998
01:12:38,250 --> 01:12:40,541
Those two boys are very smart, sir.

999
01:12:40,542 --> 01:12:42,541
At breakfast yesterday...

1000
01:12:42,542 --> 01:12:47,750
Please don't worry, Mr. Teja.

1001
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:52,834
A snoring rat can't awaken a lion, can it?

1002
01:12:53,834 --> 01:12:56,999
- According to our new plan...
- Shut up!

1003
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,041
You and your 'plans'!

1004
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:02,332
I'm going through a bad patch!

1005
01:13:02,333 --> 01:13:07,166
They speak like lions and are
not even rats themselves!

1006
01:13:07,667 --> 01:13:09,958
I don't want any excuses this time.

1007
01:13:09,959 --> 01:13:12,207
Do anything, but finish the 'game'.

1008
01:13:12,208 --> 01:13:15,749
And this time, come here
with the news of their death!

1009
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:18,374
I'll come with the corpse, if you wish.

1010
01:13:18,375 --> 01:13:21,999
Or better still, I'll kill her here in your presence.

1011
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:27,166
We've very smartly managed to
discover something more, Sir.

1012
01:13:27,792 --> 01:13:32,250
Mr. Bajaj of London has converted
all his wealth into diamonds.

1013
01:13:32,708 --> 01:13:35,041
He'll arrive here in 10 days.

1014
01:13:35,042 --> 01:13:40,791
We heard that when he was talking
to his daughter over the phone.

1015
01:13:41,291 --> 01:13:44,041
- What did boss say?
- I couldn't hear him.

1016
01:13:44,042 --> 01:13:48,375
But he definitely must have said 'smart boy'!

1017
01:13:50,208 --> 01:13:52,749
Will I get food today,
Miss Raveena?

1018
01:13:52,750 --> 01:13:54,874
- Yes, you will.
- Really?

1019
01:13:54,875 --> 01:13:56,874
Certainly.

1020
01:13:56,875 --> 01:14:00,542
- Has the doctor left?
- Forget him and eat. Okay?

1021
01:14:03,208 --> 01:14:05,249
So much of food?!
For me?!

1022
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:08,333
Careful!

1023
01:14:11,042 --> 01:14:14,916
Who hit me?

1024
01:14:14,917 --> 01:14:18,166
All that food is for us.

1025
01:14:18,917 --> 01:14:21,374
And this food is for you.

1026
01:14:21,375 --> 01:14:26,250
Pepper-balls, ginger sweets...

1027
01:14:27,834 --> 01:14:33,499
...bitter gourd soup and chilies-salad.

1028
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:36,709
I think I'm recovering my memory!

1029
01:14:37,792 --> 01:14:41,165
- Anything else?
- No.

1030
01:14:41,166 --> 01:14:43,124
Your treatment continues then.

1031
01:14:43,125 --> 01:14:46,040
Eat it, Tilu.
You'll recover soon.

1032
01:14:46,041 --> 01:14:49,625
Eat it as if it were medicine.
The doctor himself made it.

1033
01:14:50,375 --> 01:14:54,125
I'd rather die than eat this!

1034
01:14:55,792 --> 01:14:58,791
How can you die like this, Tilu?

1035
01:14:58,792 --> 01:15:02,208
We won't let you die so easily, after all.

1036
01:15:03,125 --> 01:15:07,291
Feed him with your hands, Miss.
He'll have to eat then...

1037
01:15:07,875 --> 01:15:11,709
Else, it'll break her heart.

1038
01:15:12,458 --> 01:15:17,000
Eat this...

1039
01:15:36,417 --> 01:15:42,458
You're very smart, doctor.

1040
01:15:53,041 --> 01:15:54,666
Who's all that food for, Robert?

1041
01:15:54,667 --> 01:15:56,874
It's for the doctor, sir.

1042
01:15:56,875 --> 01:16:00,834
- Is it something special?
- Yes. Especially for him.

1043
01:16:01,958 --> 01:16:04,457
With lots of butter and clarified butter.

1044
01:16:04,458 --> 01:16:06,249
I can't hope for all this.

1045
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:10,041
Could you get my medicines from
upstairs? I'll live on them now.

1046
01:16:10,625 --> 01:16:12,666
- I'll get it, sir.
- Hurry.

1047
01:16:12,667 --> 01:16:18,667
Pepper-balls for me and
mutton-soup for you, eh?!

1048
01:16:19,208 --> 01:16:22,915
Here's purgative meant for horses.
It really knocks them out!

1049
01:16:22,916 --> 01:16:28,625
- You'll crave for food!
- Is dinner served, Robert?

1050
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:36,499
Does it have enough of butter, Robert?

1051
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:41,000
This is delicious...

1052
01:16:48,834 --> 01:16:50,291
Is anything left?

1053
01:16:50,292 --> 01:16:55,207
No...
The food was excellent today.

1054
01:16:55,208 --> 01:16:57,207
- Where's Miss Raveena, Robert?
- Upstairs.

1055
01:16:57,208 --> 01:17:03,458
"For the very first time, I've seen
Love in my beloved's eyes"

1056
01:17:04,333 --> 01:17:08,500
"Now is when my heart is contented, too"

1057
01:17:12,542 --> 01:17:18,875
It's you?
Please come, doctor.

1058
01:17:19,375 --> 01:17:22,541
- Stop calling me doctor.
- Well?

1059
01:17:22,542 --> 01:17:25,791
You can call me Prem.

1060
01:17:25,792 --> 01:17:30,500
Have some oranges.

1061
01:17:31,041 --> 01:17:35,417
- I want to say something to you.
- Yes?

1062
01:17:36,875 --> 01:17:42,209
Actually, this has to do with the heart.

1063
01:17:42,584 --> 01:17:47,458
Yes...
From quite some time now...

1064
01:17:47,709 --> 01:17:52,292
Go on.

1065
01:17:53,292 --> 01:17:58,750
- Yes?
- Give me two minutes.

1066
01:18:09,041 --> 01:18:12,916
- Please come, doctor.
- I asked you not to call me doctor.

1067
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:19,374
- Call me Prem.
- Have some oranges.

1068
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,000
- You were saying something.
- Yes

1069
01:18:25,149 --> 01:18:28,983
- Yes?
- I was speaking from my heart...

1070
01:18:30,233 --> 01:18:33,273
Actually I...

1071
01:18:33,274 --> 01:18:38,107
- What is it?
- I...

1072
01:18:38,108 --> 01:18:43,733
From quite some time now...

1073
01:18:43,775 --> 01:18:48,691
Two minutes.

1074
01:18:57,191 --> 01:19:00,524
- Miss Raveena!
- Doctor!

1075
01:19:00,525 --> 01:19:03,858
- You were saying something.
- Yes, about my stomach...

1076
01:19:04,525 --> 01:19:09,525
...no!
About my heart.

1077
01:19:12,274 --> 01:19:14,732
- Are you okay, doctor?
- Should I call a doctor?

1078
01:19:14,733 --> 01:19:18,691
- He was speaking his heart.
- Heart?! Yes? What was that?

1079
01:19:19,483 --> 01:19:23,025
- I'll tell her later.
- Let me listen, too. Go on!

1080
01:19:23,483 --> 01:19:25,232
- Let me go!
- Please speak.

1081
01:19:25,233 --> 01:19:27,232
- Let me go!
- You'll break her heart!

1082
01:19:27,233 --> 01:19:29,440
- Let it break!
- Speak up, will you?

1083
01:19:29,441 --> 01:19:31,774
Speak up now or it'll be too late.

1084
01:19:31,775 --> 01:19:37,442
- It's late, anyway!
- Go away...

1085
01:19:37,566 --> 01:19:42,942
- You're fine, I hope.
- Absolutely! What can happen to me?

1086
01:19:53,358 --> 01:19:57,357
Where did this road-block materialize from?

1087
01:19:57,358 --> 01:19:59,440
The name is Crime Master Gogo!

1088
01:19:59,441 --> 01:20:02,399
I play with eye-balls as if they were marbles.

1089
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:05,357
Where's your boss, Teja?
He ran away with my money!

1090
01:20:05,358 --> 01:20:07,774
- We don't know!
- We don't know, I swear!

1091
01:20:07,775 --> 01:20:11,066
- Get down!
- Why?

1092
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:16,108
I must steal something since
I've come. It's family business!

1093
01:20:17,066 --> 01:20:22,733
I'm Mogambo's nephew...
Gogo!

1094
01:20:31,775 --> 01:20:37,858
Gogo's stunts are incredible, aren't they?

1095
01:20:46,274 --> 01:20:50,315
This was your idea, wasn't it you rascal?

1096
01:20:50,316 --> 01:20:53,607
To please Karisma in order to
know more about Raveena?

1097
01:20:53,608 --> 01:20:56,273
Exactly! Did she tell you
something about Raveena?

1098
01:20:56,274 --> 01:20:59,357
What could she tell me?

1099
01:20:59,358 --> 01:21:03,858
Whenever I ask her about Raveena,
she gives me a cold stare.

1100
01:21:05,692 --> 01:21:09,023
Karisma has fallen in
love with you, sonny boy...

1101
01:21:09,024 --> 01:21:13,232
...and deep down in your
heart, you care for her, too.

1102
01:21:13,233 --> 01:21:16,650
Yes, that's true.
But how did you know?

1103
01:21:20,817 --> 01:21:24,315
You're crazy! Do I want to be
a Cook by marrying Karisma?!

1104
01:21:24,316 --> 01:21:27,023
- Want to return to Bhopal then?
- Oh no.

1105
01:21:27,024 --> 01:21:29,732
I will not concede defeat so soon.

1106
01:21:29,733 --> 01:21:32,732
This story will take a new
turn after the Intermission.

1107
01:21:32,733 --> 01:21:37,482
Only I will get married to Raveena!

1108
01:21:37,483 --> 01:21:41,400
- Where are you, Doctor Khurana?
- Hide! Quickly!

1109
01:21:43,066 --> 01:21:46,315
Here's a blanket!

1110
01:21:46,316 --> 01:21:49,899
- Who were you talking to?
- To myself.

1111
01:21:49,900 --> 01:21:53,399
- Who will listen to my woeful tale?
- I will...

1112
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:56,899
- No!
- All day, all night...

1113
01:21:56,900 --> 01:22:01,525
...without batting an eyelid.
I will listen and listen...

1114
01:22:03,941 --> 01:22:08,650
I will... tell you the story some
other day. Now I must...

1115
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:11,565
...prepare the patient's medicine.
- Why do you love him so much?

1116
01:22:11,566 --> 01:22:14,607
Love? If I could help it,
I would strangle him!

1117
01:22:14,608 --> 01:22:16,732
- What does that mean?
- I mean...

1118
01:22:16,733 --> 01:22:19,900
...I'd thrust the medicine down
his throat. So, he'd recover.

1119
01:22:20,733 --> 01:22:23,983
Where's the noise coming from?
What are you boiling?

1120
01:22:24,525 --> 01:22:27,691
It's my pain, actually!

1121
01:22:27,692 --> 01:22:29,399
There's pain there and here, too.

1122
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:32,817
Everybody's under pressure.
What can one do?

1123
01:22:33,233 --> 01:22:37,316
Cure Tilu soon, so that we can
have some party and music.

1124
01:22:38,066 --> 01:22:41,440
Madam loves music a lot, anyway.

1125
01:22:41,441 --> 01:22:43,566
- Madam likes music, eh?
- Yes.

1126
01:22:43,567 --> 01:22:48,733
Raveena likes it?
Listen to it then!

1127
01:23:50,692 --> 01:27:15,025
EROS

1128
01:28:05,941 --> 01:28:08,107
This poison is extracted
from a scorpion, Robert.

1129
01:28:08,108 --> 01:28:11,400
Mix just two drops in somebody's drinks...

1130
01:28:12,025 --> 01:28:15,150
...the one who drinks it,
turns blue and then yellow.

1131
01:28:15,733 --> 01:28:17,357
What happens after that, sir?

1132
01:28:17,358 --> 01:28:22,066
After that he sleeps the
slumber of death forever.

1133
01:28:22,858 --> 01:28:26,608
- Economical and trusted.
- It must be effective, too?

1134
01:28:26,983 --> 01:28:31,691
It looks as if it's used on animals!

1135
01:28:32,317 --> 01:28:33,982
- Yes. On buffaloes.
- Buffaloes!

1136
01:28:33,983 --> 01:28:37,024
Hold him tight, Miss Raveena.

1137
01:28:37,025 --> 01:28:40,065
- I don't want it.
- But I must give it!

1138
01:28:40,066 --> 01:28:43,400
Remember, this poisoned drink is for Raveena.

1139
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:46,857
I'll give it to her, sir.

1140
01:28:46,858 --> 01:28:50,773
I don't want it!
Leave me!

1141
01:28:50,774 --> 01:28:55,233
Let him give you the injection.
It's for your own good.

1142
01:28:56,066 --> 01:29:01,317
Do that again... run your
hands on my cheek, please!

1143
01:29:04,649 --> 01:29:07,816
It's coming back... my memory's returning!

1144
01:29:08,233 --> 01:29:12,274
- Your memory?!
- Do it again, please...

1145
01:29:12,275 --> 01:29:16,566
It's here! It's back!

1146
01:29:19,066 --> 01:29:23,357
Thank you, Miss Raveena!
I feel like...

1147
01:29:23,358 --> 01:29:28,733
I can't control my joy!
I don't know what I'm doing!

1148
01:29:29,524 --> 01:29:31,357
You understand, don't you?

1149
01:29:31,358 --> 01:29:34,732
You do?!

1150
01:29:34,733 --> 01:29:38,691
It's a miracle!
A miracle!

1151
01:29:39,442 --> 01:29:42,691
To celebrate this, give your
servants gifts on my behalf!

1152
01:29:43,275 --> 01:29:45,565
Give them a bonus and a day's holiday!

1153
01:29:45,566 --> 01:29:48,149
- We normally do this.
- You do?

1154
01:29:48,150 --> 01:29:51,358
I'm Amar Singh, son of the
landlord of Bhevnagar, Vikram Singh!

1155
01:29:52,358 --> 01:29:55,733
I have only two hobbies; hunting and soccer.

1156
01:29:56,900 --> 01:29:58,732
- I used to be a champion!
- Really?

1157
01:29:58,733 --> 01:30:00,523
I used to play for Mohan Bagan!

1158
01:30:00,524 --> 01:30:03,940
He's getting even crazier!
I must give him this injection!

1159
01:30:03,941 --> 01:30:07,065
Hey, doctor! Just take your fees and get lost!

1160
01:30:07,066 --> 01:30:09,149
He's really gone mad, Madam!

1161
01:30:09,150 --> 01:30:11,565
You're a servant, yet you climb
sofas and even call me mad, eh?

1162
01:30:11,566 --> 01:30:13,940
You are mad!

1163
01:30:13,941 --> 01:30:18,483
If you had recovered, the doctor
would have known. Right, doctor?

1164
01:30:19,108 --> 01:30:22,192
The patient first knows
whether he has recovered!

1165
01:30:23,192 --> 01:30:25,149
Try to understand, Madam...

1166
01:30:25,150 --> 01:30:27,523
You've changed colors ever
since the doctor has arrived!

1167
01:30:27,524 --> 01:30:29,648
Haven't you changed, too?

1168
01:30:29,649 --> 01:30:31,482
Is he the one being treated or is it you?

1169
01:30:31,483 --> 01:30:36,608
At this rate, you'll be a patient too!

1170
01:30:41,566 --> 01:30:43,565
It's Robert's birthday.

1171
01:30:43,566 --> 01:30:46,691
On this happy occasion, he
has prepared a special drink.

1172
01:30:47,566 --> 01:30:50,149
It's called the
"Drink of the Heavens"

1173
01:30:50,150 --> 01:30:53,107
You may present the drinks, Robert.

1174
01:30:53,108 --> 01:30:58,149
You didn't tell me it was my birthday.

1175
01:31:07,233 --> 01:31:11,316
Take this glass.

1176
01:31:11,317 --> 01:31:14,607
Please, sir...

1177
01:31:14,608 --> 01:31:21,399
Cheers for Robert's birthday
and to my regained memory!

1178
01:31:22,941 --> 01:31:25,316
You think we'd really believe
you've regained your memory?

1179
01:31:25,317 --> 01:31:28,732
- What proof do you have?
- Proof? Idiot!

1180
01:31:28,733 --> 01:31:32,066
I remember everything!
I was a champion at football!

1181
01:31:32,067 --> 01:31:38,649
I even remember that historic match of 1988...

1182
01:31:39,067 --> 01:31:42,150
...when I scored six consecutive
goals for Mohan Bagan!

1183
01:31:42,691 --> 01:31:44,899
Let me show you how.
I was positioned here...

1184
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:48,232
...and here was the
wicket-keeper of the opposition.

1185
01:31:48,233 --> 01:31:51,900
The goal-keeper, idiot!
This is soccer!

1186
01:31:52,566 --> 01:31:55,232
- Give me your glasses. Quick!
- Our glasses? Why?

1187
01:31:55,233 --> 01:31:57,107
- Come on!
- Here you are.

1188
01:31:57,108 --> 01:31:59,191
Strange servants this house has!

1189
01:31:59,192 --> 01:32:03,982
Your glasses! Climbs the sofa, insolent girl!

1190
01:32:03,983 --> 01:32:06,607
May I have your glass, too, Miss Raveena?

1191
01:32:06,608 --> 01:32:08,940
Let her finish her drink!

1192
01:32:08,941 --> 01:32:11,565
- Okay, you have it.
- No, I don't want it.

1193
01:32:11,566 --> 01:32:15,233
- Go ahead. It's your birthday!
- It's okay... play your game.

1194
01:32:18,524 --> 01:32:20,982
As I had the ball with me,
I was surrounded...

1195
01:32:20,983 --> 01:32:24,066
...I was here and there, there and here...

1196
01:32:24,067 --> 01:32:27,149
...left and right, fooling everyone of them...

1197
01:32:27,150 --> 01:32:30,858
...they kept running helter-skelter.
Making them dance, I approached...

1198
01:32:31,358 --> 01:32:34,650
...maneuvering my way to the goal-keeper...

1199
01:32:35,233 --> 01:32:38,441
I made the goal-keeper dance, too...
And then... GOAL!

1200
01:32:40,816 --> 01:32:43,649
Do you have your proof now?
Do you believe me? Yes!

1201
01:32:43,650 --> 01:32:46,941
- Here are your glasses.
- 'Our' glasses?

1202
01:32:48,108 --> 01:32:50,274
- Here are yours.
- No, thank you.

1203
01:32:50,275 --> 01:32:55,692
Strange servants. They now
refuse to take it! Take the glasses!

1204
01:33:14,192 --> 01:33:20,191
Good... it's very good.

1205
01:33:27,150 --> 01:33:33,983
Why aren't you people drinking?
Go ahead. It's very good!

1206
01:33:35,399 --> 01:33:37,774
Don't show your teeth.
Drink it!

1207
01:33:37,775 --> 01:33:41,191
It's my birthday, Madam.
I'll drink last.

1208
01:33:41,192 --> 01:33:43,732
He's insulting you, Miss Raveena!

1209
01:33:43,733 --> 01:33:49,691
- What was that, Bhalla?
- I'll drink it, Madam.

1210
01:33:50,566 --> 01:33:55,150
Now... you drink.

1211
01:34:11,067 --> 01:34:12,774
There's something fishy here.

1212
01:34:12,775 --> 01:34:18,191
Go on, drink it!
Drink it!

1213
01:34:19,816 --> 01:34:24,274
Swallow it! Go on!
You'll get a blow! Swallow it!

1214
01:34:26,233 --> 01:34:29,691
I knew something of this sort would happen.

1215
01:34:32,608 --> 01:34:36,608
If we go on like this, we'll be
made the 'game' one day!

1216
01:34:38,566 --> 01:34:41,066
I've got great satisfaction!

1217
01:34:41,067 --> 01:34:44,107
Sorry, sir.
We made a mistake.

1218
01:34:44,108 --> 01:34:45,774
That younger boy...

1219
01:34:45,775 --> 01:34:50,399
Please don't worry, Mr. Teja.

1220
01:34:51,816 --> 01:34:56,150
Till when will the prey escape the lion?

1221
01:34:56,983 --> 01:35:02,150
According to my new plan...

1222
01:35:03,483 --> 01:35:06,357
What kind of people have you employed, Teja?

1223
01:35:06,358 --> 01:35:10,399
They wear suits worth Rs. 10,000 but
don't possess brains worth 10 paise!

1224
01:35:11,067 --> 01:35:14,941
You'll end up in a heap, if
you keep such company.

1225
01:35:14,942 --> 01:35:17,440
You'll have to do something on your own, Teja!

1226
01:35:17,441 --> 01:35:20,942
Stand on your own two feet.
Start now, Teja!

1227
01:35:24,149 --> 01:35:26,565
You both can't do a thing.

1228
01:35:26,566 --> 01:35:30,233
I think I'll have to deal with you now.

1229
01:35:31,441 --> 01:35:35,067
There's a fair being held
at Fort Mayavi tomorrow.

1230
01:35:35,942 --> 01:35:39,732
Both these girls will go to the fair, too.

1231
01:35:39,733 --> 01:35:42,148
They will be killed there.

1232
01:35:42,149 --> 01:35:44,066
Very good.

1233
01:35:44,067 --> 01:35:46,565
But I will come to the fair, too.

1234
01:35:46,566 --> 01:35:49,398
I'll deal the cards henceforth.

1235
01:35:49,399 --> 01:35:53,025
But those two jokers...
what's to be done with them?

1236
01:35:53,733 --> 01:35:57,900
They both are destined to die at my hands.

1237
01:35:58,817 --> 01:36:01,941
According to the plan...

1238
01:36:01,942 --> 01:36:05,025
Hurry up, Miss Raveena. There's
a time to get to the temple.

1239
01:36:05,441 --> 01:36:08,565
Only then are you granted your wish.

1240
01:36:08,566 --> 01:36:10,232
What are you looking back for?

1241
01:36:10,233 --> 01:36:13,482
Don't mention that inauspicious name now.

1242
01:36:13,483 --> 01:36:17,108
- Let's go, 'Uncle"...
- Well, my son...

1243
01:36:17,608 --> 01:36:19,774
...where are you taking your sister?

1244
01:36:19,775 --> 01:36:22,774
Sister? Are you blind?
Let's go!

1245
01:36:22,775 --> 01:36:24,982
Okay, sit down.

1246
01:36:24,983 --> 01:36:28,733
- Take my hand, dear.
- Yes, he's an old man.

1247
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:36,149
What's the matter, dear?
Where's the glow of your face?

1248
01:36:36,775 --> 01:36:41,274
Maybe you had to accompany
someone else and are not!

1249
01:36:41,566 --> 01:36:46,525
O God! You and your ways!
Grapes for an ape!

1250
01:36:47,108 --> 01:36:49,899
You dare call her an ape?!

1251
01:36:49,900 --> 01:36:53,525
No, son...
I called her the grape...

1252
01:36:54,775 --> 01:36:58,148
Grape?! That's a nice fruit.

1253
01:36:58,149 --> 01:37:00,732
You can move a little, dear.

1254
01:37:00,733 --> 01:37:03,774
Don't touch her! Let's go!
Old ass!

1255
01:37:03,775 --> 01:37:07,066
Thinking of your father, son?
Let's go...

1256
01:37:07,858 --> 01:37:12,149
We'll go... from the presence of everybody else!

1257
01:37:12,566 --> 01:37:16,023
Let's go...

1258
01:37:16,024 --> 01:37:19,566
The rose fell off!
Get it back for her, son.

1259
01:37:19,983 --> 01:37:21,899
We're getting late.
I'll get you another.

1260
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:24,023
What a shame!

1261
01:37:24,024 --> 01:37:27,107
Had the rose fallen off from my wife's hand...

1262
01:37:27,108 --> 01:37:28,857
...I would have leapt after it!

1263
01:37:28,858 --> 01:37:31,232
Shame on the youngsters of the day!

1264
01:37:31,233 --> 01:37:33,691
- I'll get it.,
- Sit down.

1265
01:37:33,692 --> 01:37:36,482
You'll take ages!

1266
01:37:36,483 --> 01:37:39,607
Let's go!

1267
01:37:39,608 --> 01:37:43,774
Hey, old man!
Where are you taking her?!

1268
01:38:44,566 --> 01:41:59,858
EROS

1269
01:43:48,275 --> 01:43:51,232
- You're very much 'that'.
- What?

1270
01:43:51,233 --> 01:43:54,940
- 'That'.
- What?

1271
01:43:54,941 --> 01:43:58,232
That!

1272
01:43:58,233 --> 01:44:04,399
'That', eh?
'That' I am.

1273
01:44:10,150 --> 01:44:13,649
The love-birds are here,
but where are my guys?

1274
01:44:17,066 --> 01:44:20,442
- Where were you?
- We fell asleep, sir.

1275
01:44:21,191 --> 01:44:23,773
- Where's the gun?
- I have it, sir.

1276
01:44:23,774 --> 01:44:26,274
Here it is.

1277
01:44:26,275 --> 01:44:29,524
- What's this?
- This is Vasco Da Gama's gun.

1278
01:44:29,525 --> 01:44:30,898
Which 'Mama' (Uncle)

1279
01:44:30,899 --> 01:44:33,065
It's Vasco Da Gama's gun.

1280
01:44:33,066 --> 01:44:35,648
You don't have to aim with this.

1281
01:44:35,649 --> 01:44:42,025
Just imagine the guy and fire... it finds its target!

1282
01:44:56,317 --> 01:45:01,566
Let me take a look, Sir.

1283
01:45:05,566 --> 01:45:09,942
What was that?

1284
01:45:12,442 --> 01:45:17,066
What do you think went wrong?

1285
01:45:26,733 --> 01:45:30,066
That's life, pal...
You win some, lose some.

1286
01:45:30,816 --> 01:45:34,983
It's all part of the game.
Hadn't I asked you to return?

1287
01:45:35,566 --> 01:45:37,565
That you couldn't win here?

1288
01:45:37,566 --> 01:45:41,066
Just think; there's such a difference
between you and Raveena.

1289
01:45:41,733 --> 01:45:45,983
You need looks and luck to
marry such a wealthy girl.

1290
01:45:46,524 --> 01:45:50,025
You lack both.

1291
01:45:51,358 --> 01:45:53,357
I know very well...

1292
01:45:53,358 --> 01:45:57,192
...the broken heart, affects the brains, too.

1293
01:45:58,025 --> 01:46:02,566
Look what I've got.
Rum to drive away sorrows...

1294
01:46:02,983 --> 01:46:05,065
Have this tonight, to lessen
your burden of sorrow.

1295
01:46:05,066 --> 01:46:08,732
But don't get hooked; it affects your liver.

1296
01:46:08,733 --> 01:46:11,565
I've got something to talk to you about.

1297
01:46:11,566 --> 01:46:14,065
Go upstairs. I've no time.
Talk to Prem.

1298
01:46:14,066 --> 01:46:16,232
You're misunderstanding me.

1299
01:46:16,233 --> 01:46:21,358
I don't talk to servants.
Good-bye.

1300
01:46:28,150 --> 01:46:30,732
I want to say something to you, Prem.

1301
01:46:30,733 --> 01:46:33,441
But that shouldn't affect our relationship.

1302
01:46:33,442 --> 01:46:38,691
Relationship? What relationship?
You're a strange girl!

1303
01:46:39,150 --> 01:46:42,192
I'm not what you think I am.

1304
01:46:42,608 --> 01:46:45,232
- Meaning?
- I'm not Karisma.

1305
01:46:45,233 --> 01:46:46,982
What difference does it make?

1306
01:46:46,983 --> 01:46:52,441
If not Karisma, you could be
Jamila, Shakila, Sunita or Papita...

1307
01:46:53,150 --> 01:46:56,358
...whatever you are, my boat has capsized!

1308
01:46:56,900 --> 01:47:00,108
You see, that
Raveena is not Raveena...

1309
01:47:00,566 --> 01:47:05,565
...she's me and I'm her.

1310
01:47:05,566 --> 01:47:08,065
You are not you, it's her...

1311
01:47:08,066 --> 01:47:11,815
...she's not her, she's you.

1312
01:47:11,816 --> 01:47:14,316
You are not you and she's not her.

1313
01:47:14,317 --> 01:47:19,524
Am 'I' what I am, or not what I am?

1314
01:47:20,025 --> 01:47:21,482
Who am 'I'?

1315
01:47:21,483 --> 01:47:24,775
Idiot! I'm Ramgopal Bajaj's
daughter, Raveena Bajaj.

1316
01:47:25,275 --> 01:47:28,565
She's our accountant
Harishankar's daughter, Karisma.

1317
01:47:28,566 --> 01:47:30,940
- What?!
- Yes.

1318
01:47:30,941 --> 01:47:33,982
We had swapped names.

1319
01:47:33,983 --> 01:47:39,192
I wanted a boy to love me, and not my wealth.

1320
01:47:40,399 --> 01:47:43,775
And that love...
I've found in your eyes, Prem.

1321
01:47:44,399 --> 01:47:48,858
Really?

1322
01:47:55,192 --> 01:47:58,857
I have never liked India.

1323
01:47:58,858 --> 01:48:02,232
Even my friends used to tell me this.

1324
01:48:02,233 --> 01:48:06,232
"Amar, you're not made for this country"

1325
01:48:06,233 --> 01:48:10,191
"You should be elsewhere"

1326
01:48:10,192 --> 01:48:14,858
It's good that you came from
abroad and like a jeweler...

1327
01:48:15,317 --> 01:48:18,398
...recognized a diamond.

1328
01:48:18,399 --> 01:48:22,857
Otherwise, the people here
are, well... like Indians.

1329
01:48:22,858 --> 01:48:24,398
They could never know my true worth.

1330
01:48:24,399 --> 01:48:27,149
I've been trying to tell you...

1331
01:48:27,150 --> 01:48:32,566
You're trying to say that after
marriage we'll stay in London.

1332
01:48:34,025 --> 01:48:36,066
That we will have to do.

1333
01:48:36,067 --> 01:48:39,399
To handle the huge business
empire of your father...

1334
01:48:39,816 --> 01:48:42,815
...I'll have to stay in London.

1335
01:48:42,816 --> 01:48:47,648
You want to share your joy.

1336
01:48:47,649 --> 01:48:52,565
I believe in that, too.
Excuse me...

1337
01:48:52,566 --> 01:48:58,900
The evening shall be spent in our name.

1338
01:49:00,483 --> 01:49:04,108
The champagne and dinner for the
evening, for all of you, is on us!

1339
01:49:05,316 --> 01:49:09,816
Applause!

1340
01:49:12,108 --> 01:49:16,316
- How's that possible?
- You see, I can understand you.

1341
01:49:44,691 --> 01:49:47,315
Poor chap.

1342
01:49:47,316 --> 01:49:50,191
I think he's drunk everything.

1343
01:49:50,192 --> 01:49:53,440
It happens...

1344
01:49:53,441 --> 01:49:56,900
...a broken heart affects the brains.

1345
01:49:59,608 --> 01:50:03,149
Now, what can be done?
I tried to make him understand.

1346
01:50:03,150 --> 01:50:05,815
To return to Bhopal.

1347
01:50:05,816 --> 01:50:08,942
That nothing was possible here.
But he wouldn't listen.

1348
01:50:09,399 --> 01:50:12,024
- Now listen Amar...
- It's too late.

1349
01:50:12,025 --> 01:50:16,192
The poor chap's youth will
be spent in an asylum.

1350
01:50:16,816 --> 01:50:20,899
- Why don't you understand, Amar!
- Please explain, Raveena.

1351
01:50:20,900 --> 01:50:24,441
I'm not Raveena, I'm Karishma.
She's Raveena Bajaj.

1352
01:50:25,067 --> 01:50:27,149
She's Ramgopal Bajaj's only heir.

1353
01:50:27,150 --> 01:50:30,149
I'm his accountant,
Harishankar's daughter.

1354
01:50:30,150 --> 01:50:33,024
I did all this at
Raveena's instructions.

1355
01:50:33,025 --> 01:50:36,775
Prem... is not crazy.
He's dancing in glee.

1356
01:50:37,691 --> 01:50:41,232
Raveena must have told him the truth.

1357
01:50:41,233 --> 01:50:44,565
Prem has won what you badly wanted.

1358
01:50:44,566 --> 01:50:50,567
I have no wealth, Amar.
I have nothing.

1359
01:51:16,441 --> 01:51:18,565
It's good that we took this route, isn't it?

1360
01:51:18,566 --> 01:51:21,608
Or Gogo would have held us!
How was the idea?

1361
01:51:25,399 --> 01:51:28,190
- Where's your boss, Teja?
- We don't know.

1362
01:51:28,191 --> 01:51:30,524
Why do you always harass us because of him?

1363
01:51:30,525 --> 01:51:33,732
I won't spare him.
I'll have his eye-balls for marbles!

1364
01:51:33,733 --> 01:51:36,607
- I want my money!
- You'll get your money!

1365
01:51:36,608 --> 01:51:39,107
Teja's brother is bringing
diamonds from London.

1366
01:51:39,108 --> 01:51:42,357
He'll sell the diamonds and pay you off!

1367
01:51:42,358 --> 01:51:44,398
- I don't want the money.
- Good.

1368
01:51:44,399 --> 01:51:47,398
I want the diamonds!

1369
01:51:47,399 --> 01:51:49,899
- Get down!
- Why?

1370
01:51:49,900 --> 01:51:53,441
I'll steal something, since
I'm here! It's family business!

1371
01:51:53,858 --> 01:51:59,108
Mogambo's nephew, Gogo!

1372
01:52:00,191 --> 01:52:03,650
He took our scooter the last
time and our bicycle now...

1373
01:52:04,067 --> 01:52:06,607
...and the next time...

1374
01:52:06,608 --> 01:52:10,941
Did you see that?
Gogo's gimmicks?!

1375
01:52:14,608 --> 01:52:16,482
He's not at the bus-stop
and not at the tea-shop...

1376
01:52:16,483 --> 01:52:19,690
- Where have you been?
- Why? What's wrong?

1377
01:52:19,691 --> 01:52:22,232
Nothing yet...
But she went away crying.

1378
01:52:22,233 --> 01:52:23,857
Who?
Which Raveena?

1379
01:52:23,858 --> 01:52:27,148
The one who was first
Raveena and is now Karisma?

1380
01:52:27,149 --> 01:52:30,191
Is it the one who pretended to be the servant?

1381
01:52:30,733 --> 01:52:32,816
Or is it the one who
pretended to be money-bags?

1382
01:52:32,817 --> 01:52:34,941
- 'Your' Raveena!
- What happened to her?

1383
01:52:34,942 --> 01:52:38,148
She went away crying.
She said she'd commit suicide.

1384
01:52:38,149 --> 01:52:40,482
- What are you saying?
- Read it.

1385
01:52:40,483 --> 01:52:45,275
- Where did she go?
- There.

1386
01:52:58,608 --> 01:53:03,399
What's wrong?
Why are you screaming?

1387
01:53:03,942 --> 01:53:05,857
What happened?
I almost died!

1388
01:53:05,858 --> 01:53:09,315
What does this mean?
What have you written?

1389
01:53:09,316 --> 01:53:12,148
What's wrong with that?
I really came here to die...

1390
01:53:12,149 --> 01:53:15,857
...but I found it a bit too high.

1391
01:53:15,858 --> 01:53:19,357
I'll jump from down below.
It'll hurt less.

1392
01:53:19,358 --> 01:53:22,899
- What nonsense is this?
- What's my life to you, anyway?

1393
01:53:22,900 --> 01:53:26,982
Your love for me wasn't real in any case.

1394
01:53:26,983 --> 01:53:30,107
Look Raveena... I mean, Karisma...

1395
01:53:30,108 --> 01:53:33,357
Look at me...
Look into my eyes.

1396
01:53:33,358 --> 01:53:36,899
Does my love seem fake to you?

1397
01:53:36,900 --> 01:53:40,565
I admit I had come to enact a farce.

1398
01:53:40,566 --> 01:53:43,732
But I've really fallen in love with you.

1399
01:53:43,733 --> 01:53:47,441
Whoever you are, however you are... I love you.

1400
01:53:48,066 --> 01:53:50,899
Your friend has hurt my friend's heart.

1401
01:53:50,900 --> 01:53:52,607
If something happens to her...

1402
01:53:52,608 --> 01:53:56,358
...I'll never forgive you!

1403
01:53:56,983 --> 01:54:00,149
- But Karisma...
- Not Karisma, Raveena!

1404
01:54:02,191 --> 01:54:06,149
My friend talks a lot, but he's a nice chap.

1405
01:54:06,692 --> 01:54:08,941
He'd never hurt your friend.

1406
01:54:08,942 --> 01:54:11,649
She's gone to end her life!
What about that?

1407
01:54:11,650 --> 01:54:13,565
- Nothing.
- What?

1408
01:54:13,566 --> 01:54:18,024
Amar could even con the
God of Death and bring Him here.

1409
01:54:18,566 --> 01:54:23,774
They'll be here any moment, arm in arm.

1410
01:54:24,233 --> 01:54:27,732
- Where were you?
- She went to end her life.

1411
01:54:27,733 --> 01:54:31,732
She wanted less height.
I brought her back.

1412
01:54:31,733 --> 01:54:33,982
- Didn't I say, Karisma...
- What did you say?

1413
01:54:33,983 --> 01:54:37,607
- It's very confusing!
- Oh yes, it is!

1414
01:54:37,608 --> 01:54:41,692
This is a great problem.

1415
01:54:42,650 --> 01:54:46,065
We're not concerned with
what your real names are...

1416
01:54:46,066 --> 01:54:52,400
...your names will be what
we have always called you!

1417
01:54:58,400 --> 01:55:01,107
At least meet Amar and Prem once, Dad.

1418
01:55:01,108 --> 01:55:03,315
We've known them well.
They're one in a million.

1419
01:55:03,316 --> 01:55:06,899
They're not only handsome,
but able and sensible too.

1420
01:55:06,900 --> 01:55:09,482
It's 8 'O Clock.
Where's my newspaper?

1421
01:55:09,483 --> 01:55:13,315
Everything should be done at its time.

1422
01:55:13,316 --> 01:55:16,524
- Prem is a very good man.
- Amar's good at heart.

1423
01:55:16,525 --> 01:55:18,732
- They're wonderful.
- Intelligent.

1424
01:55:18,733 --> 01:55:22,274
- Handsome, wise...
- Good-hearted...

1425
01:55:22,275 --> 01:55:25,190
Where's my tea?

1426
01:55:25,191 --> 01:55:27,899
There's a time for everything.

1427
01:55:27,900 --> 01:55:35,900
I've been hearing about them since I've arrived.

1428
01:55:36,400 --> 01:55:38,565
Nobody seems to be asking about me.

1429
01:55:38,566 --> 01:55:41,023
Call them at 7 tomorrow.

1430
01:55:41,024 --> 01:55:45,024
Is it time for the sugar, sir?

1431
01:55:45,817 --> 01:55:49,148
Listen carefully or you could ruin everything.

1432
01:55:49,149 --> 01:55:51,898
- Uncle speaks little.
- Hears little, too.

1433
01:55:51,899 --> 01:55:55,065
- Is he deaf?
- Don't talk nonsense with him.

1434
01:55:55,066 --> 01:55:58,483
- Don't be quiet out of fear, okay?
- What's there to fear?

1435
01:55:59,066 --> 01:56:02,399
It's a matter of love.
Of getting married...

1436
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:05,232
...we marry at home with
consent; in the temple without it...

1437
01:56:05,233 --> 01:56:10,358
- Right?
- I thought so too.

1438
01:56:28,608 --> 01:56:31,399
Put your hands down.
You're three minutes late!

1439
01:56:31,400 --> 01:56:34,482
Do you know the value of three minutes?

1440
01:56:34,483 --> 01:56:36,898
One can finalize deals worth
crores in that much time!

1441
01:56:36,899 --> 01:56:39,566
I had reserved six minutes for you.

1442
01:56:39,567 --> 01:56:42,399
Three minutes for you to
speak and three for me.

1443
01:56:42,400 --> 01:56:46,023
You've lost your three minutes;
Now only listen...

1444
01:56:46,024 --> 01:56:49,692
Amar and Prem...

1445
01:56:51,066 --> 01:56:55,024
...full of purity and devotion.

1446
01:56:56,233 --> 01:57:00,441
Your names had suggested that you
were glamour-struck vagabonds.

1447
01:57:01,858 --> 01:57:05,607
But you're useless parasites, too.

1448
01:57:05,608 --> 01:57:08,733
While you do certainly
look like illiterate bums...

1449
01:57:09,400 --> 01:57:13,233
...you proved to be greater fools when you...

1450
01:57:13,650 --> 01:57:17,066
...thought I'd agree to this match.

1451
01:57:18,858 --> 01:57:21,107
My three minutes are not up.

1452
01:57:21,108 --> 01:57:23,566
I've brought up these girls with
a lot of love and affection.

1453
01:57:23,567 --> 01:57:26,149
But I think they need medical help...

1454
01:57:26,150 --> 01:57:28,524
...because they've chosen rascals like you.

1455
01:57:28,525 --> 01:57:33,233
Pull the finger out of the mouth and get lost!

1456
01:57:34,483 --> 01:57:36,566
- What happened?
- What else?

1457
01:57:36,567 --> 01:57:39,232
He tried to throw his weight
around and started bragging.

1458
01:57:39,233 --> 01:57:41,065
About his achievements and status.

1459
01:57:41,066 --> 01:57:43,399
I told him that we were not
concerned with whatever he was!

1460
01:57:43,400 --> 01:57:45,732
It's for you to see, as to how we are!

1461
01:57:45,733 --> 01:57:48,649
Quiet!
He was absolutely quiet!

1462
01:57:48,650 --> 01:57:51,691
He really felt that what
I had said made sense.

1463
01:57:51,692 --> 01:57:54,898
- Tell them what I said, too.
- Oh yes!

1464
01:57:54,899 --> 01:57:57,732
His spirits also rose, when he
saw me. What's that you said?

1465
01:57:57,733 --> 01:58:00,858
I shut him up! I gave 2 answers
for each of his question.

1466
01:58:01,358 --> 01:58:04,107
There was one question, and two answers...!

1467
01:58:04,108 --> 01:58:07,190
It was only questions and
answers and then... silence!

1468
01:58:07,191 --> 01:58:12,150
A long silence...

1469
01:58:13,150 --> 01:58:17,358
You should do something to win his respect.

1470
01:58:17,899 --> 01:58:23,650
For instance, suppose Ramgopal
Bajaj gets into some problem...

1471
01:58:24,108 --> 01:58:26,691
...and you rescue him!

1472
01:58:26,692 --> 01:58:30,065
He himself is the 'problem'!
What problem will be get into?

1473
01:58:30,066 --> 01:58:31,399
Bloody Hitler!

1474
01:58:31,400 --> 01:58:34,733
Just suppose the old man gets kidnapped...

1475
01:58:35,233 --> 01:58:38,649
...and the two of you risk your lives to save him!

1476
01:58:38,650 --> 01:58:40,691
Won't both of you be heroes then?

1477
01:58:40,692 --> 01:58:42,982
Is that a marriage-plan or a death-trap?

1478
01:58:42,983 --> 01:58:44,815
He's talking about risking lives!

1479
01:58:44,816 --> 01:58:47,691
We won't risk our lives!
Who'll kidnap him anyway?

1480
01:58:47,692 --> 01:58:50,399
We will kidnap him.

1481
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:53,525
We'll ask for a ransom of 5 lakhs,
but you come and rescue him!

1482
01:58:54,108 --> 01:59:00,275
Isn't the problem solved?
Very simple!

1483
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:04,649
The man's a real 'clock', sir!

1484
01:59:04,650 --> 01:59:08,107
He has things planned for every single second!

1485
01:59:08,108 --> 01:59:12,815
You should call him the HMT
instead of Ramgopal Bajaj!

1486
01:59:12,816 --> 01:59:18,816
- So you're Teja's goons, eh?
- Not I, sir, it's him!

1487
01:59:20,316 --> 01:59:22,482
- It's him...
- He brought me here!

1488
01:59:22,483 --> 01:59:25,399
You work for him and even lie about it!

1489
01:59:25,400 --> 01:59:29,525
We work for him? Oh no!
He's a first-rate rascal, sir!

1490
01:59:30,191 --> 01:59:33,650
Let's go the Police Station, sir...

1491
01:59:33,983 --> 01:59:36,732
...we'll have him reported
and thrown behind bars!

1492
01:59:36,733 --> 01:59:38,732
I'll finish of your game!

1493
01:59:38,733 --> 01:59:41,649
Dealing my cards in my absence, eh?

1494
01:59:41,650 --> 01:59:44,399
Mr. Teja!
I always knew!

1495
01:59:44,400 --> 01:59:47,441
You've really pulled off this gimmick, sir!

1496
01:59:47,442 --> 01:59:49,773
I imitate him well, don't I?

1497
01:59:49,774 --> 01:59:53,150
- We both were fooled.
- Everybody else will be, too!

1498
01:59:53,858 --> 01:59:57,608
What I have to decide is
how to get into his house now!

1499
01:59:58,150 --> 02:00:04,274
I'll make the plan for that, too.

1500
02:00:05,899 --> 02:00:09,358
- He gets up at 6 every morning.
- And goes jogging after that!

1501
02:00:09,733 --> 02:00:14,858
- He jogs near the Ladies Hostel.
- Voyeuristic chap, sir!

1502
02:00:15,358 --> 02:00:18,608
- He reads the papers at 7 a.m.
- And bathes at 7.30, sharp.

1503
02:00:19,066 --> 02:00:24,025
Sitting in the garden, he reads the
newspaper for exactly 9.30 minutes.

1504
02:00:24,567 --> 02:00:28,816
- He's at the Golf Club at 9 a.m.
- Knows nothing, but plays Golf too!

1505
02:00:29,233 --> 02:00:35,191
Then, for exactly 13 minutes, he
walks about the golf-course all alone.

1506
02:00:35,608 --> 02:00:41,358
That's it!
When he's alone!

1507
02:01:06,066 --> 02:01:10,650
Fresh lime juice.

1508
02:01:36,941 --> 02:01:40,316
He must be kidnapped by now!
There will be a phone call, too!

1509
02:01:40,317 --> 02:01:43,733
Don't you go on ranting in there.
You'll spoil the whole show.

1510
02:01:44,150 --> 02:01:45,773
Just stay by my side silently.

1511
02:01:45,774 --> 02:01:47,232
I only meant to help you, pal.

1512
02:01:47,233 --> 02:01:53,025
You want to get married?
Then please don't help me!

1513
02:01:53,400 --> 02:01:56,483
- You're looking very beautiful.
- Is Daddy at home?

1514
02:01:59,191 --> 02:02:01,399
Why are both of you so quiet?

1515
02:02:01,400 --> 02:02:05,025
- Has your Dad scolded you again?
- There's no trace of Dad.

1516
02:02:05,691 --> 02:02:07,399
He hasn't even returned home.

1517
02:02:07,400 --> 02:02:10,149
He hasn't been kidnapped, has he?

1518
02:02:10,150 --> 02:02:12,857
He talks nonsense.
Your Dad will be back.

1519
02:02:12,858 --> 02:02:16,399
I'm getting scared.
There isn't even a telephone call.

1520
02:02:16,400 --> 02:02:21,400
There will be a telephone call soon!

1521
02:02:23,983 --> 02:02:28,983
What?!

1522
02:02:29,317 --> 02:02:31,982
Uncle has been kidnapped!
The ransom is Rs.50 lakhs!

1523
02:02:31,983 --> 02:02:36,441
- 50 lakhs?!
- Give the phone to me...

1524
02:02:36,442 --> 02:02:40,191
Ask them why it is 50 lakhs...
It's disconnected?

1525
02:02:40,192 --> 02:02:43,566
Please don't worry...
Your father is our father!

1526
02:02:44,400 --> 02:02:46,732
We'll risk our
lives to save him!

1527
02:02:46,733 --> 02:02:48,773
We'll be back in a jiffy!

1528
02:02:48,774 --> 02:02:54,858
I mean, it'll be difficult!
Please don't cry... you too.

1529
02:02:56,233 --> 02:02:57,773
The plan's successful!

1530
02:02:57,774 --> 02:02:59,732
The girls and the old man will be happy!

1531
02:02:59,733 --> 02:03:02,357
Congratulations on the Wedding!

1532
02:03:02,358 --> 02:03:05,441
Hey listen!

1533
02:03:05,442 --> 02:03:09,108
Uncle hasn't been kidnapped.
It's all a stunt of Amar and Prem.

1534
02:03:09,566 --> 02:03:12,065
- How do you know?
- I heard them talking.

1535
02:03:12,066 --> 02:03:14,565
- They planned to please uncle.
- How's that?

1536
02:03:14,566 --> 02:03:18,066
They'll first have him kidnapped
and them have him released...

1537
02:03:18,442 --> 02:03:21,399
...they'll be heroes in his opinion, right?

1538
02:03:21,400 --> 02:03:24,442
Yes! But how much of trouble
they've put us through.

1539
02:03:24,900 --> 02:03:26,732
We'll teach them a lesson, too.

1540
02:03:26,733 --> 02:03:30,399
It's incredible!

1541
02:03:30,400 --> 02:03:33,065
Honestly tell us, for how long
have you been in this business?

1542
02:03:33,066 --> 02:03:35,690
What's up now?

1543
02:03:35,691 --> 02:03:38,065
Instead of asking for 5 lakhs,
why did you ask for 50?

1544
02:03:38,066 --> 02:03:40,940
- Oh no!
- It's okay if you asked...

1545
02:03:40,941 --> 02:03:44,065
...but who's going to pay up?

1546
02:03:44,066 --> 02:03:47,107
We haven't asked for Rs.50 lakhs...
He has.

1547
02:03:47,108 --> 02:03:49,024
- Who's 'he'?
- Yes, who's 'he'?

1548
02:03:49,025 --> 02:03:51,440
The one who kidnapped
Ramgopal Bajaj.

1549
02:03:51,441 --> 02:03:54,232
- What did you say?
- I'll explain...

1550
02:03:54,233 --> 02:03:56,732
Everything went off according to our plan...

1551
02:03:56,733 --> 02:03:59,648
...we even had him in our trap.
But then...

1552
02:03:59,649 --> 02:04:02,565
There was a sudden attack on our heads.

1553
02:04:02,566 --> 02:04:04,690
The earth split, the heavens fell and...

1554
02:04:04,691 --> 02:04:06,732
Cut out the details!

1555
02:04:06,733 --> 02:04:09,482
This has turned serious, Prem.

1556
02:04:09,483 --> 02:04:15,191
There seems to be an
organized gang behind all this.

1557
02:04:19,025 --> 02:04:23,899
You're looking very smart today.

1558
02:04:23,900 --> 02:04:27,149
Has Uncle returned?

1559
02:04:27,150 --> 02:04:31,983
- He will.
- He's been kidnapped by a big gang.

1560
02:04:32,524 --> 02:04:35,440
We know that.

1561
02:04:35,441 --> 02:04:38,648
They've asked for Rs.50 lakhs.
The money will be paid.

1562
02:04:38,649 --> 02:04:42,358
It's okay... he's their father.
They're not bothered. Why should we?

1563
02:04:43,025 --> 02:04:46,899
Sit down. There's food here.
Let's eat.

1564
02:04:46,900 --> 02:04:50,524
- You don't seem to understand...
- A big gang and a small amount...

1565
02:04:50,858 --> 02:04:53,732
...only Rs.50 lakhs?!

1566
02:04:53,733 --> 02:04:56,482
Rs.50 lakhs?!

1567
02:04:56,483 --> 02:04:59,900
That's too much!
We were asking only for Rs.5 lakhs.

1568
02:05:00,566 --> 02:05:03,149
And he felt that was too much, too!

1569
02:05:03,150 --> 02:05:07,858
He should be ashamed!

1570
02:05:08,067 --> 02:05:11,649
You've arranged for the money, haven't you?

1571
02:05:12,317 --> 02:05:15,316
We have your bosses here.
Talk to them.

1572
02:05:15,317 --> 02:05:18,483
My boss?!
Who's this boss of mine?!

1573
02:05:25,733 --> 02:05:29,566
- This is Amar speaking.
- Give the phone to Raveena, punk!

1574
02:05:31,816 --> 02:05:35,690
- He wants to talk to you.
- I don't want to talk.

1575
02:05:35,691 --> 02:05:38,690
Tell me, what is it?

1576
02:05:38,691 --> 02:05:41,107
Give the phone to
Raveena, will you?!

1577
02:05:41,108 --> 02:05:45,275
- He wants to talk to you.
- He's your man. You talk to him.

1578
02:05:48,983 --> 02:05:51,107
They're not willing to talk.
Tell me whatever it is.

1579
02:05:51,108 --> 02:05:54,482
You donkey, idiot, scoundrel... rascal, ape...

1580
02:05:54,483 --> 02:05:56,607
You're a donkey and your father, too!

1581
02:05:56,608 --> 02:05:59,191
Speak now or I'll disconnect!

1582
02:05:59,192 --> 02:06:02,358
Listen!
Ramgopal Bajaj is in our custody.

1583
02:06:02,733 --> 02:06:08,150
If you want him alive, come to
the old temple with Rs.50 lakhs.

1584
02:06:08,816 --> 02:06:12,733
If you act smart, we'll
knock him off. Understand?

1585
02:06:13,192 --> 02:06:17,858
Your father's kidnapped, and
you're not even talking to him!

1586
02:06:19,691 --> 02:06:22,649
Enough is enough!
There's a limit to these jokes.

1587
02:06:22,650 --> 02:06:24,357
Now go and bring my father home.

1588
02:06:24,358 --> 02:06:26,690
We have not kidnapped your father.

1589
02:06:26,691 --> 02:06:32,150
But I heard you talking about
your plans. What about that?

1590
02:06:32,816 --> 02:06:36,025
Prem will explain that to you.
Explain it to them, Prem.

1591
02:06:52,733 --> 02:06:54,899
Yes.
That is exactly how it happened.

1592
02:06:54,900 --> 02:06:58,315
It means, our men did really try to kidnap him...

1593
02:06:58,316 --> 02:07:00,357
...but he was kidnapped by these guys.

1594
02:07:00,358 --> 02:07:03,232
What?!

1595
02:07:03,233 --> 02:07:06,398
Has Daddy really been kidnapped?!

1596
02:07:06,399 --> 02:07:09,607
Now look; it's our mistake...

1597
02:07:09,608 --> 02:07:13,232
...we will even risk our lives to save him.

1598
02:07:13,233 --> 02:07:15,191
Your father is...

1599
02:07:15,192 --> 02:07:18,565
...well, not out father.
Our fathers are back home.

1600
02:07:18,566 --> 02:07:21,191
- Let's go.
- You can cry if you wish.

1601
02:07:21,192 --> 02:07:25,440
- Here's a napkin.
- Let's go.

1602
02:07:25,441 --> 02:07:29,815
So, you converted your
earnings into diamonds, eh?

1603
02:07:29,816 --> 02:07:35,941
- How did you know?
- How did I know, eh?!

1604
02:07:36,524 --> 02:07:39,565
I won't give you the diamonds, even if I die.

1605
02:07:39,566 --> 02:07:44,607
Who'll bother you if you're dead anyway?

1606
02:07:44,608 --> 02:07:47,775
Now listen Ramu... quietly
give me the locker-number...

1607
02:07:48,316 --> 02:07:51,232
...I'm being tolerant because
you're my brother...

1608
02:07:51,233 --> 02:07:53,357
...or I would have finished you off long ago!

1609
02:07:53,358 --> 02:07:56,440
I've asked for Rs.50 lakhs, for your safety.

1610
02:07:56,441 --> 02:07:59,691
Your daughters must be on
their way with the money.

1611
02:08:00,566 --> 02:08:04,024
With Rs.50 lakhs, the police will be silenced...

1612
02:08:04,025 --> 02:08:07,482
...and I'll lead a peaceful
life as Ramgopal Bajaj.

1613
02:08:07,483 --> 02:08:10,066
Neither will the locker be out
of reach, nor the number.

1614
02:08:10,067 --> 02:08:15,567
Certainly not the keys, and
not at all the diamonds!

1615
02:08:27,566 --> 02:08:31,067
I asked for Rs.50 lakhs...
they're carrying it in that bag!?

1616
02:08:32,233 --> 02:08:36,982
- Must be 50 checks of a lakh each!
- Shut up!

1617
02:08:36,983 --> 02:08:40,857
I'll go and find out.

1618
02:08:40,858 --> 02:08:44,107
Amar... let's return.

1619
02:08:44,108 --> 02:08:46,816
He hasn't turned up.
I don't think he will.

1620
02:08:46,817 --> 02:08:49,899
I want to urinate... we'll
return tomorrow morning.

1621
02:08:49,900 --> 02:08:51,899
Wait.
Getting scared, are you?

1622
02:08:51,900 --> 02:08:55,525
No, not scared... I'm a bit frightened of nights.

1623
02:08:56,025 --> 02:09:01,483
Why get frightened?
I'm with you! Don't be...

1624
02:09:02,399 --> 02:09:05,024
- Why are you screaming?!
- Don't scream!

1625
02:09:05,025 --> 02:09:08,233
- What is it?
- Where's the dough?

1626
02:09:08,566 --> 02:09:10,315
- Here it is...
- Wait!

1627
02:09:10,316 --> 02:09:12,232
- Where's uncle?
- Where's the money?

1628
02:09:12,233 --> 02:09:15,525
- Here it is!
- Look, we're not novices...

1629
02:09:16,025 --> 02:09:18,398
...we want to see uncle, before
we show you the money. Right?

1630
02:09:18,399 --> 02:09:20,941
- See this...
- What is it? What is...

1631
02:09:20,942 --> 02:09:25,858
Give it to him! Hurry up!
What are you waiting for?

1632
02:09:29,608 --> 02:09:32,148
- This is small change!
- Small change?

1633
02:09:32,149 --> 02:09:35,148
It nothing less than Rs. 8,535.39!

1634
02:09:35,149 --> 02:09:38,066
Do you think I'd rob a piggy-bank?

1635
02:09:38,067 --> 02:09:40,565
This isn't ransom, it's more
like a donation for funerals!

1636
02:09:40,566 --> 02:09:43,649
- We've brought all we had.
- Yes...

1637
02:09:43,650 --> 02:09:45,690
I had asked for Rs.50 lakhs.
Where is it?

1638
02:09:45,691 --> 02:09:48,024
Where will we get
Rs.50 lakhs from?

1639
02:09:48,025 --> 02:09:49,982
- Why?
- You have a faulty plan!

1640
02:09:49,983 --> 02:09:52,565
You kidnapped the father
and asked the daughter.

1641
02:09:52,566 --> 02:09:55,774
You should have kidnapped the
daughter and threatened the father!

1642
02:09:55,775 --> 02:09:58,232
You've got it all wrong!
He seems to be a novice!

1643
02:09:58,233 --> 02:10:02,899
- Shut up! Or I'll shoot you!
- Sorry!

1644
02:10:02,900 --> 02:10:05,315
Get Ramu ready.

1645
02:10:05,316 --> 02:10:08,273
They've brought only Rs.7,000.

1646
02:10:08,274 --> 02:10:12,024
Didn't I say they're smart?
The shorter one...

1647
02:10:12,025 --> 02:10:15,065
We'll manage with this.

1648
02:10:15,066 --> 02:10:17,315
Don't you dare touch the money.

1649
02:10:17,316 --> 02:10:21,065
Keep an eye on Ramgopal;
I'll keep coming.

1650
02:10:21,066 --> 02:10:23,232
I'm leaving now; don't spend a penny.

1651
02:10:23,233 --> 02:10:26,274
- Uncle's come!
- We risked our lives for you!

1652
02:10:26,692 --> 02:10:31,148
- Okay, let's go.
- Yes, let's go.

1653
02:10:31,149 --> 02:10:33,899
- You can sit behind.
- Come here, in the middle.

1654
02:10:33,900 --> 02:10:36,732
- Push up a little. Come here...
- Yes... but how will I drive?

1655
02:10:36,733 --> 02:10:38,941
Are you comfortable?

1656
02:10:38,942 --> 02:10:41,524
- Sit on the bar there.
- Yes, on the bar here.

1657
02:10:41,525 --> 02:10:44,440
But how will I drive?
Sit in his lap, uncle!

1658
02:10:44,441 --> 02:10:46,565
- Yes, in my lap!
- Get down!

1659
02:10:46,566 --> 02:10:48,440
Sit in his lap, they say!
Get down!

1660
02:10:48,441 --> 02:10:53,692
He's an idiot... he won't even
know we're sitting here!

1661
02:10:57,024 --> 02:10:58,816
Get this thing, clearly.

1662
02:10:58,817 --> 02:11:02,190
If you love us, you'll have to
forsake your father and his wealth.

1663
02:11:02,191 --> 02:11:04,023
We agree, Prem...

1664
02:11:04,024 --> 02:11:07,066
...but father has changed a lot.

1665
02:11:07,817 --> 02:11:11,566
For someone who used to hate
liquor, he simply gulps it down!

1666
02:11:12,191 --> 02:11:14,941
Do you know the kind of foul language he uses!

1667
02:11:14,942 --> 02:11:16,399
It happens...

1668
02:11:16,400 --> 02:11:19,566
...it's the gangsters' influence
on him. Forget him!

1669
02:11:20,983 --> 02:11:24,525
- He's spoilt!
- Hitler is a write-off, eh?!

1670
02:11:24,983 --> 02:11:26,857
This is no time to joke.

1671
02:11:26,858 --> 02:11:30,817
He searched the house the other day,
as he were a cop in a thief's house!

1672
02:11:32,024 --> 02:11:34,732
He overturned the entire house last night.

1673
02:11:34,733 --> 02:11:40,608
- Overturned?
- Overturned?!

1674
02:12:41,358 --> 02:12:43,982
What's this?
Uncle? In this condition?

1675
02:12:43,983 --> 02:12:50,067
My God!
The world changes in seconds!

1676
02:12:56,400 --> 02:12:59,274
It's good that Karisma and
Raveena didn't come, too.

1677
02:12:59,275 --> 02:13:02,441
They would have wept, had
they seen this side of him.

1678
02:13:03,275 --> 02:13:07,315
I'm thinking of his late wife.

1679
02:13:07,316 --> 02:13:12,566
- Her soul must be in turmoil now!
- Great turmoil!

1680
02:13:12,567 --> 02:13:15,692
But so quickly?
He was okay just now.

1681
02:13:16,775 --> 02:13:19,607
He's okay even now.

1682
02:13:19,608 --> 02:13:22,065
But since when has he picked up these vices?

1683
02:13:22,066 --> 02:13:27,524
- I think there's some suspense.
- Suspense?

1684
02:13:34,441 --> 02:13:37,399
- The film 'Seeta Aur Geeta'!
- No! It was 'Ram Aur Shyam'!

1685
02:13:37,400 --> 02:13:43,066
Not one, but two uncles!

1686
02:13:43,733 --> 02:13:46,357
There's only one uncle.
The other's a look-alike.

1687
02:13:46,358 --> 02:13:48,732
Just like him!

1688
02:13:48,733 --> 02:13:50,982
- Let's go to the police.
- No, not the police.

1689
02:13:50,983 --> 02:13:53,607
This is the opportunity to
turn heroes in his opinion.

1690
02:13:53,608 --> 02:13:56,816
- How?
- Somehow or the other...

1691
02:13:57,108 --> 02:14:02,691
...we have to lock up the fake
one and pull out the real uncle!

1692
02:14:03,066 --> 02:14:05,898
Do you think I'd tell your clowns
about the diamonds, too?

1693
02:14:05,899 --> 02:14:08,898
- What?
- I'll give you the diamonds.

1694
02:14:08,899 --> 02:14:12,400
I?
I'll own Rs.30 crores?

1695
02:14:13,233 --> 02:14:16,274
I'll lead a decent life now.

1696
02:14:16,275 --> 02:14:21,525
I'll fulfill a dream that I had in
the corner of my heart for years.

1697
02:14:22,400 --> 02:14:27,065
I'll start a poultry farm.

1698
02:14:27,066 --> 02:14:30,775
I'll have thousands of birds.

1699
02:14:31,899 --> 02:14:34,190
Which will lay lakhs of eggs.

1700
02:14:34,191 --> 02:14:38,983
That will lead to many crore
new birds and many more eggs!

1701
02:14:39,941 --> 02:14:42,773
And billions of omelets!

1702
02:14:42,774 --> 02:14:46,898
I'll supply the bread to eat those eggs too.

1703
02:14:46,899 --> 02:14:49,357
I'll even have a bakery.

1704
02:14:49,358 --> 02:14:53,650
The Ling of Bakeries... and
the Emperor of Omelets!

1705
02:14:54,692 --> 02:14:59,399
"Our own Bajaj..."

1706
02:15:02,899 --> 02:15:05,566
You'll make omelets with
my hard-earned money, eh?

1707
02:15:05,567 --> 02:15:11,358
You'll start a bakery for the bread, too, eh?

1708
02:15:24,858 --> 02:15:28,108
Oh God!
Thank you very much!

1709
02:15:28,858 --> 02:15:33,483
What are you animals doing here?

1710
02:15:34,233 --> 02:15:39,233
We were awaiting you, uncle!

1711
02:15:40,525 --> 02:15:46,691
He looks just like our Uncle!

1712
02:15:48,233 --> 02:15:50,607
All that free food has made him fat!

1713
02:15:50,608 --> 02:15:52,190
We'll cut him down to size!

1714
02:15:52,191 --> 02:15:55,566
Uncle, get up!
We're here, Uncle!

1715
02:15:55,567 --> 02:15:58,399
Hurry up, uncle!
Let's go home!

1716
02:15:58,400 --> 02:16:00,898
Raveena and Karisma are
awaiting you there. Let's go!

1717
02:16:00,899 --> 02:16:04,108
- We risked our lives to save you.
- Yes, that's true!

1718
02:16:04,899 --> 02:16:06,732
Bravo! Bravo!

1719
02:16:06,733 --> 02:16:12,567
Tie him up, properly.
Lest he escapes again.

1720
02:16:13,150 --> 02:16:18,566
Yes! Let's do it again!

1721
02:16:19,066 --> 02:16:21,607
- What's this, uncle?
- I'm not 'uncle'!

1722
02:16:21,608 --> 02:16:26,773
I'm Teja!

1723
02:16:26,774 --> 02:16:29,566
He cleverly locked me in...

1724
02:16:29,567 --> 02:16:35,607
...and you cleverly pulled
me out and put him in!

1725
02:16:35,608 --> 02:16:40,691
Amuse yourself with rummy.
I'm off to play my game! Bye!

1726
02:16:41,483 --> 02:16:44,983
You're all mixed up, Uncle!
You're the real uncle!

1727
02:16:45,774 --> 02:16:49,025
Forget him and take care of
this chap. He can get violent!

1728
02:16:49,567 --> 02:16:51,274
I'll kill both of you!

1729
02:16:51,275 --> 02:16:53,566
He's not uncle,
I am!

1730
02:16:53,567 --> 02:16:56,065
You should have at least asked me who I was!

1731
02:16:56,066 --> 02:16:58,107
I had got out with great difficulty!

1732
02:16:58,108 --> 02:17:03,774
I knew when I first saw you that
you're the greatest fools ever!

1733
02:17:04,567 --> 02:17:07,773
I still haven't cooled down.

1734
02:17:07,774 --> 02:17:12,065
Donkeys! Owls! Apes! Illiterate bums...

1735
02:17:12,066 --> 02:17:15,149
Don't you dare utter another word!

1736
02:17:15,150 --> 02:17:18,190
We were just beginning to understand
who's Karisma and who's Raveena...

1737
02:17:18,191 --> 02:17:21,857
...and here's another!
Who's uncle?!

1738
02:17:21,858 --> 02:17:23,898
Is this a family-disease?

1739
02:17:23,899 --> 02:17:27,400
Is it our mistake that you resemble each other?

1740
02:17:28,191 --> 02:17:30,732
Had we asked your parents
to give birth to twins?

1741
02:17:30,733 --> 02:17:34,190
That too, a crook like him?!
What is to be done now?

1742
02:17:34,191 --> 02:17:40,191
Don't you dare move!

1743
02:17:41,733 --> 02:17:46,191
Don't wipe that off!

1744
02:17:51,442 --> 02:17:56,108
Come now...
Let's think of something.

1745
02:17:59,150 --> 02:18:01,566
What I can't understand, sir...

1746
02:18:01,567 --> 02:18:04,648
...is why do Hindi films portray
gangsters and villains...

1747
02:18:04,649 --> 02:18:07,399
...as stupid and morons?

1748
02:18:07,400 --> 02:18:11,607
Because all of them are not smart as we are.

1749
02:18:11,608 --> 02:18:15,150
- Where the hell were you?!
- What is that to you?

1750
02:18:15,483 --> 02:18:19,025
I'm Teja...
Open the door!

1751
02:18:19,483 --> 02:18:22,607
- So, you're Teja, eh?
- I... speak up!

1752
02:18:22,608 --> 02:18:24,274
This man is Teja.

1753
02:18:24,275 --> 02:18:27,149
If this is Teja, who is that man outside?

1754
02:18:27,150 --> 02:18:30,691
He was Ramgopal Bajaj.
He tricked me and locked me inside!

1755
02:18:31,566 --> 02:18:34,190
Then why did he leave these clowns with you?

1756
02:18:34,191 --> 02:18:37,316
Why don't you speak?!

1757
02:18:37,317 --> 02:18:40,649
You don't understand; He doesn't
want us to marry his daughters!

1758
02:18:41,275 --> 02:18:43,024
That's why he's
locked us inside.

1759
02:18:43,025 --> 02:18:46,565
- Look at this mark!
- Mark?

1760
02:18:46,566 --> 02:18:48,232
What mark is that?

1761
02:18:48,233 --> 02:18:51,400
Look at this pack of cards...
Your game will be over!

1762
02:18:52,400 --> 02:18:55,940
These are Teja's cards...
We've made a mistake!

1763
02:18:55,941 --> 02:18:59,025
- Open them! Where are the keys!?
- I'll finish the game!

1764
02:18:59,524 --> 02:19:03,566
- Hurry up, Robert.
- I'll finish your game!

1765
02:19:04,275 --> 02:19:08,025
I hope you didn't have any difficulty in there, sir.

1766
02:19:08,400 --> 02:19:10,773
Don't touch us!

1767
02:19:10,774 --> 02:19:13,357
We'll handle everything now.
Explain everything, Teja.

1768
02:19:13,358 --> 02:19:17,900
- What's there to explain?
- They are very understanding...

1769
02:19:18,275 --> 02:19:20,399
...their faces tell us how smart they are.

1770
02:19:20,400 --> 02:19:25,733
Don't smile! Straighten your cap and follow me!

1771
02:19:28,733 --> 02:19:31,857
This is Prem here.
We're bringing Uncle...

1772
02:19:31,858 --> 02:19:34,065
...till then, keep an eye on Uncle.

1773
02:19:34,066 --> 02:19:37,065
- Aw, shut up!
- What's he saying?

1774
02:19:37,066 --> 02:19:40,399
That man at home is not uncle.
He's an impostor.

1775
02:19:40,400 --> 02:19:44,107
He's Teja. Keep an eye on
him till we reach there.

1776
02:19:44,108 --> 02:19:48,232
But he's just
left with the keys!

1777
02:19:48,233 --> 02:19:49,773
He must have gone to the bank.

1778
02:19:49,774 --> 02:19:52,316
Don't worry.
We'll send the real uncle home...

1779
02:19:52,317 --> 02:19:58,733
...and go to the bank to
nab the fake one. Let's go.

1780
02:20:00,941 --> 02:20:03,024
There he goes! Catch him!

1781
02:20:03,025 --> 02:20:08,025
Wait!
I was a champ at stone-throwing!

1782
02:20:12,400 --> 02:20:15,024
It's found the mark!
'Rabbit' throws well!

1783
02:20:15,025 --> 02:20:17,191
Robert, not Rabbit!
Hurry!

1784
02:20:17,192 --> 02:20:20,065
We've found the diamonds, sir.

1785
02:20:20,066 --> 02:20:21,607
Bravo!

1786
02:20:21,608 --> 02:20:24,983
We'll call Teja and tell him we've
found this. He'll reward you!

1787
02:20:26,192 --> 02:20:29,566
Till Teja recovers...
I mean, keep hitting him!

1788
02:20:30,108 --> 02:20:37,192
They'll call Teja and ask him
to kill this chap. And then...

1789
02:20:39,066 --> 02:20:44,358
My dear!

1790
02:20:46,566 --> 02:20:48,316
My name is Crime Master Gogo!

1791
02:20:48,317 --> 02:20:50,191
I'll have his eye-balls for marbles!

1792
02:20:50,192 --> 02:20:53,066
I won't spare anyone!
Not even Teja!

1793
02:20:53,067 --> 02:20:57,815
- He's my father, not Teja.
- Teja's gone to the bank.

1794
02:20:57,816 --> 02:21:03,441
What's this fuss about?
Take all of them with us!

1795
02:21:03,566 --> 02:21:07,565
They disappeared after
they went to make that call.

1796
02:21:07,566 --> 02:21:11,067
Where's your boss, Teja?
Where are my diamonds?

1797
02:21:11,858 --> 02:21:15,066
- He's gone to fetch the girls.
- Amar's giving the diamonds to Teja.

1798
02:21:15,067 --> 02:21:17,982
- Bajaj is lying there.
- Bajaj is in the car!

1799
02:21:17,983 --> 02:21:23,941
- No, this is Bajaj.
- Bajaj is in my car!

1800
02:21:33,649 --> 02:21:35,690
Hey! Where are you going?

1801
02:21:35,691 --> 02:21:37,774
- I was looking for you.
- Why?

1802
02:21:37,775 --> 02:21:40,357
He's disappeared with uncle and the two girls.

1803
02:21:40,358 --> 02:21:42,732
- Who?
- Crime Master Gogo.

1804
02:21:42,733 --> 02:21:47,524
He's asked you to reach here with
the diamonds if you want them alive.

1805
02:21:48,566 --> 02:21:51,899
And he's also said that if you inform the police...

1806
02:21:51,900 --> 02:21:53,774
- Then what?
- The obvious.

1807
02:21:53,775 --> 02:21:57,899
He seems to be a master at the game.

1808
02:21:57,900 --> 02:22:02,775
Get down quickly...
Careful.

1809
02:22:03,816 --> 02:22:08,108
I'll play marbles with your eye-balls!

1810
02:22:08,649 --> 02:22:12,316
- Put your hands up!
- They were always up there!

1811
02:22:13,150 --> 02:22:15,899
Come on... follow me!

1812
02:22:15,900 --> 02:22:17,690
Amar and Prem are here!

1813
02:22:17,691 --> 02:22:23,191
But why are they walking with their hands up?

1814
02:22:23,691 --> 02:22:26,232
The two clowns!

1815
02:22:26,233 --> 02:22:28,315
Careful!

1816
02:22:28,316 --> 02:22:31,399
- Your apron, my Gogo.
- I'll pick it up!

1817
02:22:33,900 --> 02:22:38,192
Hi! Hello! How are you?
Hello there! Hi...

1818
02:22:39,691 --> 02:22:43,149
Shut up! What are you greeting
them for? Are you at a party?

1819
02:22:43,150 --> 02:22:46,607
They have the diamonds, Gogo!

1820
02:22:46,608 --> 02:22:50,691
- Hello, uncle!
- I'm not uncle. I'm Teja!

1821
02:22:52,025 --> 02:22:55,192
But Teja has a mark on his face.
Right, Robert?

1822
02:22:55,858 --> 02:22:58,899
- Yes. You must have the mark.
- What mark?

1823
02:22:58,900 --> 02:23:02,150
- Which mark is this?
- I'm Teja, my name is Teja too!

1824
02:23:02,608 --> 02:23:05,649
I'm Teja, Ramu...
I am Teja!

1825
02:23:05,650 --> 02:23:07,899
You'd better listen, Ramu.
I'm Teja!

1826
02:23:07,900 --> 02:23:11,650
- I'm Teja!
- I am! I have the mark!

1827
02:23:12,108 --> 02:23:15,900
- To hell with it! I'm Teja!
- I am, because...

1828
02:23:16,274 --> 02:23:19,024
- Shut up!
- I'm Teja.

1829
02:23:19,025 --> 02:23:21,066
"What's this business of Teja, Teja?"

1830
02:23:21,067 --> 02:23:25,399
What I ask is where are the diamonds?

1831
02:23:26,067 --> 02:23:30,900
How can we have the diamonds?
We're like innocent little birds.

1832
02:23:31,775 --> 02:23:35,025
Birds... of the same flock...
flying high in the skies...

1833
02:23:35,733 --> 02:23:37,523
- Am I right, Prem?
- Why not.

1834
02:23:37,524 --> 02:23:40,523
- We're kids.
- And very naive, too.

1835
02:23:40,524 --> 02:23:42,732
- And clean-hearted, right?
- Why not?!

1836
02:23:42,733 --> 02:23:44,982
We only came here to free the girls.

1837
02:23:44,983 --> 02:23:48,357
- Let's open them. Okay, Prem?
- Why not?

1838
02:23:48,358 --> 02:23:52,067
Don't act smart.

1839
02:23:52,733 --> 02:23:55,565
I'll use your eyes for marbles!

1840
02:23:55,566 --> 02:23:57,982
Why do you want to play with our eyes?

1841
02:23:57,983 --> 02:24:02,315
They all have such big eyes.
Look at them!

1842
02:24:02,316 --> 02:24:06,025
Don't let them con you!
They have the diamonds!

1843
02:24:07,775 --> 02:24:10,482
Robert snatched them away
from me and gave it to them!

1844
02:24:10,483 --> 02:24:14,483
What silly logic!

1845
02:24:14,858 --> 02:24:17,899
Why will his goons give the diamonds to me?

1846
02:24:17,900 --> 02:24:20,232
Can you do something silly
like that, Robert and Bhalla?

1847
02:24:20,233 --> 02:24:22,857
Oh no, I'd never do that.
Never!

1848
02:24:22,858 --> 02:24:27,691
Actually, he's being misled by your face.

1849
02:24:29,399 --> 02:24:33,066
- What's wrong with my face?
- They think you're an idiot.

1850
02:24:33,067 --> 02:24:37,942
He only looks like a foolish
fellow. But he's actually not!

1851
02:24:38,775 --> 02:24:41,565
Was that praise for me or abuse?

1852
02:24:41,566 --> 02:24:45,398
Praise!
It was praise all the way, sir!

1853
02:24:45,399 --> 02:24:48,732
I've been hearing tales about
you since I was a little boy.

1854
02:24:48,733 --> 02:24:52,108
Do you know what my mother
used to say when I cried, Prem?

1855
02:24:52,900 --> 02:24:55,649
What did your mother say?

1856
02:24:55,650 --> 02:24:58,565
She used to say...
"go to sleep son..."

1857
02:24:58,566 --> 02:25:04,148
"or Gogo will be upon us"

1858
02:25:04,149 --> 02:25:07,858
Did you hear that about
Crime Master Gogo's reputation?

1859
02:25:08,399 --> 02:25:12,108
When a kid doesn't sleep his
mother says, "sleep, dear..."

1860
02:25:12,441 --> 02:25:15,816
"or it'll bring Gogo here"

1861
02:25:15,817 --> 02:25:18,524
- Go on with some more.
- What's more...

1862
02:25:18,525 --> 02:25:21,816
...I've even heard you're very
knowledgeable and all-knowing...

1863
02:25:21,817 --> 02:25:24,066
...a very accomplished person.

1864
02:25:24,067 --> 02:25:28,316
You're strong, intelligent...
I'd even say you're not a man...

1865
02:25:28,608 --> 02:25:32,273
...you're a great soul!

1866
02:25:32,274 --> 02:25:35,148
I think we should leave with
the girls now, Mr. Gogo.

1867
02:25:35,149 --> 02:25:37,066
You will certainly extract the
diamonds from them, right?

1868
02:25:37,067 --> 02:25:40,899
Go get a cab, Prem.

1869
02:25:40,900 --> 02:25:44,274
I'm knowledgeable and all-knowing...

1870
02:25:44,650 --> 02:25:46,857
- Give me a hand, sir.
- I'm strong...

1871
02:25:46,858 --> 02:25:52,025
...intelligent. In fact,
I'm not a man at all!

1872
02:25:52,650 --> 02:25:57,233
Do you know what my mother taught me?

1873
02:25:57,817 --> 02:25:59,941
- What did she say?
- She said...

1874
02:25:59,942 --> 02:26:03,942
...always first take your money
and then deliver the goods.

1875
02:26:04,566 --> 02:26:07,565
I'll take the diamonds, first.
And then give the girls!

1876
02:26:07,566 --> 02:26:10,774
Why are you pestering us, sir?
We're like innocent birds...

1877
02:26:10,775 --> 02:26:13,398
...we want to fly away.
Birds...

1878
02:26:13,399 --> 02:26:19,525
- Look at this rifle!
- It's a revolver! Move it away!

1879
02:26:26,274 --> 02:26:30,066
That's excellent, my boy!
Excellent!

1880
02:26:31,066 --> 02:26:34,065
Now is when we have the bull by its horn!

1881
02:26:34,066 --> 02:26:37,482
Don't move! Freeze!
Or I'll have you 'shaken' forever!

1882
02:26:37,483 --> 02:26:39,774
Drop your guns!

1883
02:26:39,775 --> 02:26:45,107
Not you, you idiot!
You'll have us killed!

1884
02:26:45,108 --> 02:26:49,858
I could eat all of you alive, do you know that?!

1885
02:26:53,942 --> 02:26:57,191
And you?!
You call yourself Crime Master, eh?

1886
02:27:20,024 --> 02:27:25,233
"I made a mistake by oversight!"

1887
02:27:38,108 --> 02:27:42,315
Shut up! I have a terrible temper!
I'm capable of doing anything!

1888
02:27:42,316 --> 02:27:44,732
- Bullet...
- Yes, bullets!

1889
02:27:44,733 --> 02:27:46,816
We'll put bullets in all of them!

1890
02:27:46,817 --> 02:27:49,649
It's bullets that we don't have!

1891
02:27:49,650 --> 02:27:54,358
We've had it!

1892
02:28:00,108 --> 02:28:04,024
Teja... Mr. Teja!
Please don't take offence, okay?

1893
02:28:05,066 --> 02:28:08,524
Mr. Gogo...
The Great Crime Master Gogo!

1894
02:28:08,525 --> 02:28:12,816
I was only kidding!

1895
02:28:12,817 --> 02:28:16,065
I've been hearing tales of your
heroics from my childhood!

1896
02:28:16,066 --> 02:28:19,441
"Listen, ye people of the world,
Gogo's the Greatest of them all"

1897
02:28:22,400 --> 02:28:25,732
We're only children... very
naive... very good at heart...

1898
02:28:25,733 --> 02:28:28,565
Pick up your guns, friends!

1899
02:28:28,566 --> 02:28:31,858
We're innocent like birds... who fly in the sky!

1900
02:28:32,566 --> 02:28:36,482
What should I do with this gun, Amar?

1901
02:28:36,483 --> 02:28:38,691
- There's no bullet, right?
- Haven't I said so?

1902
02:28:38,692 --> 02:28:41,565
Then throw it away!

1903
02:28:41,566 --> 02:28:46,316
I've had enough of your drama!
I'll kill everyone now!

1904
02:28:48,233 --> 02:28:52,566
Tell me, what's your
last wish before you die?

1905
02:28:53,400 --> 02:28:56,608
Gogo, my friend...
Please let me have that loaded gun!

1906
02:28:59,900 --> 02:29:03,065
What's your last wish, buddy?

1907
02:29:03,066 --> 02:29:07,066
Before I die,
I want to beat him up!

1908
02:29:07,650 --> 02:29:09,524
No! I don't want to get beaten up before I die!

1909
02:29:09,525 --> 02:29:12,065
- Please let me beat him up!
- No...

1910
02:29:12,066 --> 02:29:15,107
I give you both two minutes.

1911
02:29:15,108 --> 02:29:21,483
Bash him up if you can.
And you, save yourself if possible!

1912
02:29:34,858 --> 02:29:37,232
Why did you say there was no bullet?!

1913
02:29:37,233 --> 02:29:39,232
I made a mistake!
Forgive me!

1914
02:29:39,233 --> 02:29:44,399
- Mistake, eh?!
- No, not your knee!

1915
02:29:48,233 --> 02:29:53,858
No... Not the chair!

1916
02:30:09,775 --> 02:30:12,190
Well done, my boy!
Well done!

1917
02:30:12,191 --> 02:30:15,567
Crime Master Gogo... I'll make
Band Master Toto out of you!

1918
02:30:17,024 --> 02:30:21,566
Take their guns and throw them in the gutters!

1919
02:30:21,567 --> 02:30:24,899
Hand over your guns to the girls!
And do not act smart!

1920
02:30:25,608 --> 02:30:29,233
Else, I'll fill this
Gogo's head with lead!

1921
02:30:30,525 --> 02:30:34,482
And Gogo!
This revolver is not empty!

1922
02:30:34,483 --> 02:30:40,108
Hey!
What are you up to?

1923
02:30:45,358 --> 02:30:48,857
It had only one bullet!

1924
02:30:48,858 --> 02:30:54,691
Catch them!
Bash them up!

1925
02:32:03,858 --> 02:32:09,274
They're all getting bashed up...
Let's slip out of here!

1926
02:34:23,442 --> 02:34:28,191
Cut out the dramatics!

1927
02:34:29,941 --> 02:34:32,982
Come on, clowns!
Come to me with the diamonds...

1928
02:34:32,983 --> 02:34:37,566
...else, I'll have dealt with these girls!

1929
02:34:37,567 --> 02:34:43,108
Okay...
Give them to me.

1930
02:34:44,525 --> 02:34:46,899
Hurry up!

1931
02:34:46,900 --> 02:34:50,525
How much must these diamonds cost?
At least a crore, right?

1932
02:34:50,858 --> 02:34:53,983
A crore?! Each of these
diamonds is worth a crore!

1933
02:34:54,900 --> 02:34:57,899
Each of them, worth a crore?!

1934
02:34:57,900 --> 02:35:01,732
Yes!
It's the earning of his whole life!

1935
02:35:01,733 --> 02:35:04,482
Take one last look at them, uncle.

1936
02:35:04,483 --> 02:35:06,732
What are you showing it to him for?
Come here!

1937
02:35:06,733 --> 02:35:11,191
Do you mean that if each of
these guys gets a diamond...

1938
02:35:11,733 --> 02:35:13,732
...their lives will be made, right?

1939
02:35:13,733 --> 02:35:17,441
Their lives?!
Lives for generations to come!

1940
02:35:17,442 --> 02:35:21,815
Be quick, or I'll kill them!

1941
02:35:21,816 --> 02:35:24,732
Please don't...
Here we come.

1942
02:35:24,733 --> 02:35:26,899
You too must take a look, Gogo.

1943
02:35:26,900 --> 02:35:29,232
This will be an addition to your folklore.

1944
02:35:29,233 --> 02:35:31,274
Of passing by a terrific opportunity.

1945
02:35:31,275 --> 02:35:33,690
- Don't touch it!
- Just one diamond!

1946
02:35:33,691 --> 02:35:36,815
I've given Teja a loan!
Give me one in exchange!

1947
02:35:36,816 --> 02:35:38,899
Come right here, or I'll kill them!

1948
02:35:38,900 --> 02:35:41,607
- Careful!
- Yes, I'm taking care...

1949
02:35:41,608 --> 02:35:46,983
Careful!
Don't drop it!

1950
02:36:04,025 --> 02:36:06,316
Raveena's mother in Heaven...

1951
02:36:06,317 --> 02:36:11,733
...I'm coming to join you!

1952
02:36:14,192 --> 02:36:19,650
Give one to
Crime Master Gogo!

1953
02:36:22,108 --> 02:36:25,648
They've taken everything away!

1954
02:36:25,649 --> 02:36:27,982
There's one of them...
Catch him!

1955
02:36:27,983 --> 02:36:34,149
He hit me!
Everybody's hitting me!

1956
02:36:35,358 --> 02:36:39,065
What's happened to Daddy?

1957
02:36:39,066 --> 02:36:41,441
What's happened, father?

1958
02:36:41,442 --> 02:36:46,192
Uncle, wake up! We've
risked our lives to save you!

1959
02:36:46,733 --> 02:36:48,899
Saved me, my foot!

1960
02:36:48,900 --> 02:36:51,274
Those people have taken
away my life's savings!

1961
02:36:51,275 --> 02:36:54,816
How can they take it away,
with both of us around, uncle?

1962
02:36:55,441 --> 02:36:58,815
Get out the real diamonds, Prem!

1963
02:36:58,816 --> 02:37:02,025
- We threw away the real ones, Amar!
- What are you saying?

1964
02:37:03,566 --> 02:37:06,191
Give me the bag in which
we had kept the fake ones.

1965
02:37:06,192 --> 02:37:11,066
No, you idiot! The real
ones were in the red bag!

1966
02:37:11,441 --> 02:37:14,941
Oh no!

1967
02:37:16,275 --> 02:37:19,149
Yes, I remember now!
They were in this bag!

1968
02:37:19,150 --> 02:37:22,065
In the red bag, right?
Must be these, then!

1969
02:37:22,066 --> 02:37:27,108
I always knew my darling
daughters would choose real gems!

1970
02:37:27,649 --> 02:37:31,983
"Listen to this tale,
O people of the world..."

1971
02:37:32,399 --> 02:37:38,191
"...the name of Gogo!"

1972
02:37:40,733 --> 02:37:43,066
Whoever you are...

1973
02:37:43,067 --> 02:37:45,732
...will you win the game
in which I deal the cards?

1974
02:37:45,733 --> 02:37:47,774
Give me the diamonds!

1975
02:37:47,775 --> 02:37:51,565
There goes another opportunity!

1976
02:37:51,566 --> 02:37:55,858
Give me the diamonds, as per our plan.

1977
02:37:57,067 --> 02:38:00,648
Yes, I'm Bhalla!
Pass the diamonds, good fella!

1978
02:38:00,649 --> 02:38:05,816
Pass the diamonds here.
I won't make any mistake this time.

1979
02:38:06,691 --> 02:38:11,733
My life is made now!

1980
02:38:12,192 --> 02:38:16,692
Not a soul will move!

1981
02:38:20,775 --> 02:38:23,774
I made the mistake again!

1982
02:38:23,775 --> 02:38:27,482
Join the queue!
Take them to the prison in a queue!

1983
02:38:27,483 --> 02:38:31,398
They're already in a queue!

1984
02:38:31,399 --> 02:38:37,024
Let me see...
Teja, caught at last, eh?

1985
02:38:37,025 --> 02:38:40,523
And who are you?
Oh! Gogo!

1986
02:38:40,524 --> 02:38:44,483
At least get me back the
money I had loaned him!

1987
02:38:45,025 --> 02:38:47,316
You'll get it in prison.

1988
02:38:47,317 --> 02:38:51,899
Here are your diamonds, Mr. Ramgopal.

1989
02:38:51,900 --> 02:38:55,565
Don't thank me...
Thank Amar and Prem...

1990
02:38:55,566 --> 02:39:00,692
...It was they who rang me up.

1991
02:39:02,524 --> 02:39:06,066
- About our marriage?
- Why not?

1992
02:39:06,067 --> 02:39:07,565
For getting the diamonds back...

1993
02:39:07,566 --> 02:39:11,149
I'll get my daughters married to Amar and Prem.

1994
02:39:11,150 --> 02:39:14,441
Uncle you're great!
Magnanimous...

1995
02:39:15,316 --> 02:39:18,900
...wise...
In fact, you're not man at all!

1996
02:39:19,399 --> 02:39:24,483
You're a Great Soul!
