1
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,961
It's a nice song. Who sung it?

2
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,211
My mother did.

3
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,713
Where's your mother?

4
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:17,637
My mother's dead.

5
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:56,425
This is Hariya speaking.

6
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:58,964
Why are you calling
at this late hour?

7
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,638
Vikram Rathore is alive.

8
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,968
Let me talk to Baapji.

9
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,596
Brother-in-law!

10
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,722
Brother-in-law! Brother-in-law!

11
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,766
Brother-in-law! Get up.

12
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,269
Vikram Rathore is alive.

13
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,107
Hariya is on the line.

14
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:19,361
What nonsense.

15
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:20,861
It's true.

16
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:23,206
- Where is he?
- In Mumbai.

17
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:37,758
Hariya.

18
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:42,676
Hariya.

19
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,148
Search the entire jungle.

20
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:51,141
- His photo's on his grave.
- Brother-in-law.

21
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:54,316
Brother-in-law.
We've found the grave.

22
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,375
Dig it.

23
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,922
Open the casket.

24
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:20,965
What now, brother-in-law?

25
00:06:20,966 --> 00:06:26,221
My brother Titla, who's
feared by entire Devgarh.

26
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:30,433
He managed to survive him as well.

27
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:36,943
Vikram Rathore, where are you?

28
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,993
Find him.

29
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,089
Thief.

30
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,552
Stop.

31
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,562
This is Inspector S.K. Verma.

32
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:12,473
Lower the knife, or
else I will shoot you.

33
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:14,065
I don't care if you're
Verma or someone else.

34
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:15,151
Throw down your gun, or else..

35
00:07:15,152 --> 00:07:17,645
Please Inspector, lower your gun.

36
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:20,320
- Get inside.
- Don't worry, aunty.

37
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,033
You can take anything you want..

38
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,457
Inspector.

39
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,831
This is Inspector S.K. Verma.

40
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,084
I don't care if you're
Verma or someone else.

41
00:07:39,085 --> 00:07:41,001
Throw down your gun, or else..

42
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,628
- Sir, gun..
- Lower the gun.

43
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,381
Get inside. You think this is a joke.

44
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:45,723
Come on.

45
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:52,554
Hey! You can steal his watch,
chain, mobile..

46
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,649
But don't you dare harm him.

47
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,229
This is Inspector S.K. Verma.

48
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,071
Lower the knife, or
else I will shoot you.

49
00:08:02,072 --> 00:08:03,565
I don't care if you're
Verma or someone else.

50
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:04,692
Throw down your gun, or else..

51
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:08,654
We won't leave until we
don't meet Inspector S.K. Verma.

52
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,864
Yes, we won't leave.

53
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,492
Call S.K. Verma out.

54
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,252
Call him. Call him.

55
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:19,665
Who are you? Call
Inspector S.K. Verma.

56
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:23,466
I am.. Inspector $.K. Verma.

57
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,223
I was their first victim.

58
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:29,931
The rascals even took my uniform.

59
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,847
Shiva. Get the money
out and let's share it.

60
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:35,940
Look 2G.

61
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:38,809
- We have 35,000 in cash.
- Okay.

62
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:42,604
Now I am keeping 5000 aside
so that it's a round figure.

63
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:43,697
So, now it's 30,000.

64
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,399
- K.
- K.

65
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,028
It was my plan, so
I'll take 5000 extra.

66
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,195
- Double K.
- Double K.

67
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:54,199
Okay, so according to me this
jewelry must be worth 15,000. - Okay.

68
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,327
Which means 15,000
for you 15,000 for me..

69
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,912
And 15,000 for Kishan.

70
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,917
- Who is this Kishan?
- Did you forget Lord Kishan?

71
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,091
We loot and plunder.

72
00:09:04,092 --> 00:09:05,300
But when it comes to
doing a righteous..

73
00:09:05,301 --> 00:09:06,512
Deed you don't want to be a part.

74
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,383
Point. But listen, I
will take the gold.

75
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,634
You are very smart.
You're a scoundrel.

76
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,263
Fine, you can keep the gold.
This 15,000 is for Lord Krishna.

77
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,347
Lord, this is your share.

78
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:18,474
Congratulations. Here..

79
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:19,851
And..

80
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,321
You don't want it.

81
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:26,487
You want me to keep it.

82
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,660
Thank you. Fine.

83
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,114
- This 15,000 is my share..
- And the gold is mine.

84
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,615
These are stolen goods.

85
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:37,995
If you try to sell it in
the market you'll be caught.

86
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,704
- Think about it.
- Point.

87
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,624
You're my friend so
I'll buy it from you.

88
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,002
But, I'll give you 10,000.

89
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:47,629
Fine, give me 10,000.

90
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:51,008
Here's your 10,000.

91
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,016
You completely
forgot about those 5,000.

92
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,392
- Point.
- Point.

93
00:09:57,806 --> 00:10:01,026
Now, this 5,000 and
10,000 adds up to..

94
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,393
- 15,000.
- 15,000.

95
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,728
7 'A for you and <i>7</i> 'A for me.

96
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:05,776
Hey!

97
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:08,649
Whose plan was it? Whose plan was it?

98
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:09,993
So who will pay 5000?

99
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:13,242
Fine.

100
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,998
I gave you 10,000 for the jewelry.

101
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,450
Who's going to return that?

102
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,204
When are you going to return the
remaining 7500? When will you?

103
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,206
- Soon.
- When?

104
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,676
- Trust me.
- "Trust me."

105
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:28,510
Do you have change?

106
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,262
You're such a liar.

107
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:36,510
Get two teas.

108
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:38,637
Less sugar, more cream. Go quickly.

109
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,640
Don't think, go quickly.

110
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,813
And get a loaf of
buttered bread <i>as</i> well. Go.

111
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,732
Get two. Get it, quickly.

112
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,061
What's going on here?

113
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:24,313
Where did you get all that money from?

114
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:26,315
Tell me.

115
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:06,560
"The world goes in
reverse while I walk forward."

116
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:13,985
"I know all the games I am the best."

117
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:20,155
"The world goes in
reverse while I walk forward."

118
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:23,825
"I know all the games I am the best."

119
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:28,002
"I will take everyone to a corner.
And teach them."

120
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:45,180
"The world goes in
reverse while I go forward."

121
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:48,767
"I know all the games I am the best."

122
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:52,818
"I will take everyone to a corner.
And teach them."

123
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:35,653
"What a beauty, what a gait."

124
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:40,527
"What a beauty, what a gait."

125
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:44,283
"She's wonderful, out of this world."

126
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:55,343
"This is her first year,
she's new here."

127
00:13:56,294 --> 00:14:00,174
"All I want is a girl, dark or fair."

128
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:07,054
"All I want is a girl, dark or fair."

129
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:10,640
"I'll make her fall for me."

130
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:14,771
"I will take her to a corner.
And teach her."

131
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:39,378
- Oh god.
- Move. Move.

132
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,631
- Look, what's wrong with my husband.
- Don't worry. I am there.

133
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:44,509
Take a look.

134
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:09,709
"Pride in her eyes and
money in her pocket."

135
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:16,248
"Pride in her eyes and
money in her pocket."

136
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:20,220
"She has a naughty
attitude and a colorful coat."

137
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:25,215
"Looks innocent but
intentions are wild."

138
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:29,642
"Pajama's short, and
the underwear is loose.â€œ"

139
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:44,443
"I devise such plans,
straighten their character."

140
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:47,946
"I show them the right path."

141
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:52,293
"I will take him in a corner.
And teach him. What?"

142
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:08,176
Sir, Prabhu sir. Sir,
super start Vijay sir.

143
00:16:08,177 --> 00:16:09,803
Sir, please sir.

144
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,184
Sir, one step. One step sir.

145
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,799
Lord. Yesterday you
returned your share to Shiva.

146
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,755
Next time I will give
you a share as well.

147
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,349
Don't forget about me, Lord.

148
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:52,436
Rascal, don't make a sound.

149
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:53,888
Okay.

150
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:05,654
Glory to, Kandivali post box.

151
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:10,447
Glory to, Andheri Station ATM machine.

152
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:19,788
Shiva, our ball came inside.

153
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:21,623
Come in, take it.

154
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,501
- And have breakfast as well.
- I hope the breakfast is hot.

155
00:17:23,502 --> 00:17:25,128
Take it for your parents too.

156
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,512
Get out!

157
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,518
Take him along.

158
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,266
If your ball ever comes inside again..

159
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:41,560
Then I'll boil you in hot water ..

160
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,812
And peel you like potatoes.
Understand.

161
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:45,315
Why does the Lord create children?

162
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,617
What's wrong, Shiva? Why
are you so quiet today?

163
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:50,616
You didn't scream even
after seeing the children.

164
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,863
That's a miracle. This
is really a miracle, Lord.

165
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,411
My friend has calmed down.

166
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:57,410
Glory to Lord Krishna.

167
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:01,162
I don't know why, but I can't hear
anything properly since yesterday.

168
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:03,999
It seems like there's a bell
ringing or fireworks bursting.

169
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,917
I can also hear the police siren.

170
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,090
Are you experiencing
something similar?

171
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:08,920
Seems like after the
snack we ate yesterday..

172
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:09,966
Something went wrong with my ear.

173
00:18:09,967 --> 00:18:11,088
I'll have to go to the doctor.

174
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:12,637
But listen, we won't
go to doctor Deva.

175
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,635
He doesn't keep a wallet or watch.

176
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,183
We stole his gold chain the last time.

177
00:18:17,184 --> 00:18:18,852
He doesn't have anything left man.

178
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:21,271
Hey!

179
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,551
Hey! Thief, thief. My bag.

180
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,382
Sorry. Sorry.

181
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,313
Thank you.

182
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:02,225
You're strongly welcome.

183
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:07,693
By the way, I never saw
you in this area before.

184
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:09,941
But I did.

185
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,609
Saving that fat man's life.

186
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,408
Did you see what happened after that?

187
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,160
I will make a move.

188
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:21,036
- You don't seem from Mumbai?
- No, I am from Patna.

189
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:24,372
Are you here for shopping?

190
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,882
No, my cousin's getting married.

191
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:30,043
- Near the station?
- No. Malad.

192
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:33,588
- Near the church.
- No. Behind lnorbit Mall.

193
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,590
Paro. Give him your number.

194
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,842
- Oh yes, sorry. 9819..
- Stupid.

195
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,720
Are you going to give
your number to a stranger?

196
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:44,062
My name is Shiva, her name is Paro.

197
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,768
We look nice as a couple.

198
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:49,521
And anyway all one needs
is a heart to fall in love..

199
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:50,865
And not acquaintance.

200
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,781
I never said that I love you.

201
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:56,158
Your smile.

202
00:19:57,154 --> 00:20:00,115
Just because she smiled
you thought she's in love.

203
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:01,163
She didn't?

204
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:02,584
She didn't?

205
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:07,163
If you think about me
for the next 24 hours..

206
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,914
Then assume that
you're in love with me.

207
00:20:08,915 --> 00:20:11,135
Otherwise I will think
that it was just one-sided.

208
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:16,641
- He was so over-confident.
- Who?

209
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:19,008
- Shiva.
- Who, Shiva?

210
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,805
The same guy who was saying
that for the next 24 hours

211
00:20:20,806 --> 00:20:22,100
I will think only about him.

212
00:20:22,101 --> 00:20:23,304
He was right.

213
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,103
You are thinking about him.

214
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,896
Two orange granitas and
two mushroom sandwiches.

215
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,117
Waiter.

216
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,621
Two orange granitas,
two mushroom sandwiches.

217
00:20:41,622 --> 00:20:42,707
Anything else, ma'am?

218
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,126
Thank you.

219
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,339
Thanks.

220
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,041
Sorry, $0")?

221
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,134
It's okay.

222
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,003
Fool.

223
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,130
Big fool.

224
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:58,553
We should hurry up,
aunty must be waiting.

225
00:20:58,554 --> 00:20:59,641
Really.

226
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,278
Shiva was right.

227
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,663
I am seeing him everywhere.

228
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:26,411
I think.. I'm in love.

229
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,205
I think even I am in love with Shiva.

230
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,798
Even I am seeing him everywhere.

231
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:41,808
Next

232
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,396
Enter the dragon.

233
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,640
Curse you.

234
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,609
- What happened?
- Children crossed my path.

235
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,939
I don't mind even if 100
black cats cross my path.

236
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:58,233
But children are devils.

237
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:00,703
- They ruined everything. Let's go.
- Just a minute.

238
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:03,448
You take the back-door
and I'll take the front.

239
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,413
Why didn't I think of this?

240
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:07,706
Very good.

241
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:13,006
He's so strong.

242
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,933
Control, Shiva. Control.

243
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:32,734
Paro

244
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,404
- Greetings, uncle.
- Bless you, dear. Bless you.

245
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:40,739
Don't your relatives follow
any rituals or traditions?

246
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:44,028
They took your blessings
but they neglected me.

247
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,698
It's because they don't know you.

248
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:48,667
Greetings, Aunt.

249
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:52,036
See. This is what you call culture.

250
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,085
This is called tradition.

251
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:56,125
Get up, son. Get up.

252
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:02,223
Why are you just standing there?
Take aunt's blessings.

253
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:03,595
Greetings, aunt.

254
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:06,977
Bless you. Bless you.

255
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:09,230
Take her blessings again.

256
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:10,890
Greetings once again, aunty.

257
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,893
Why are you taking my
blessings twice, son?

258
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:16,146
I wasn't satiated.

259
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:19,440
See. This is what you call culture.

260
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:22,942
Go, son. Go inside,
get something to eat.

261
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,694
Consider this your own house, son.

262
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:26,743
- Aunt, can I massage your other foot?
- No. No.

263
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,244
- Go, son.
- Fine.

264
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:31,118
You go too, son.

265
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:33,204
Can I take your blessings again, aunt?

266
00:23:33,205 --> 00:23:34,455
Aunt!

267
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:54,390
You, here?

268
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:56,769
You kept thinking about
me all day, didn't you?

269
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:01,991
- You too, didn't you?
- No, I wasn't thinking anything.

270
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,414
- Kiran.
- Yes, sister.

271
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:14,202
If anyone needs me then I
am in the room upstairs.

272
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:15,329
Okay.

273
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:18,458
Did she say something?

274
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:31,386
'If anyone needs me then I
am in the room upstairs.'

275
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:32,764
'Fine, sister. I will.'

276
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:00,124
What do you think?

277
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:03,381
Girls will fall for
you at first sight?

278
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:05,671
Tell me something.

279
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,678
You don't have charm like Shahrukh.

280
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:11,050
Or looks like Hrithik.

281
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,145
Nor cuteness like Aamir.

282
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,188
Or, body like Salman.

283
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:18,226
- You forgot the 'Khiladi'.
- I see.

284
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:21,525
What's so special about you? Show us.

285
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:24,069
Shall I?

286
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,347
How did you like it?

287
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,932
You showed us what's
special about you.

288
00:25:58,432 --> 00:26:00,981
Now we'll have to show you
what's special about us.

289
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,772
Show me, please.

290
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:19,913
"Gorgeous and capricious."

291
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:25,338
"They call me enchantress."

292
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:35,760
"Gorgeous and capricious."

293
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:38,596
"They call me enchantress."

294
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:44,185
"Don't <i>cross</i> my path, beloved."

295
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:49,023
"This love will cost you dearly."

296
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:51,994
"He-5 done for."

297
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:57,325
"He's learned his lesson."

298
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,419
"Gorgeous and capricious."

299
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:13,339
"They call me enchantress."

300
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:18,845
"Stay weary of my, beloved."

301
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:23,724
"This love will cost you dearly."

302
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:26,945
"Gorgeous and capricious."

303
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:55,095
"My beauty makes people go wild."

304
00:27:55,424 --> 00:28:00,476
"I've made many
change their intentions."

305
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:10,986
"My beauty makes people go wild."

306
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,319
"I've made many
change their intentions."

307
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:22,158
"Wherever I look, I can create sagas."

308
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:28,838
"You'll find my lovers everywhere."

309
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:33,679
"I am no ordinary."

310
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:38,972
"I've come across many like you."

311
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:25,935
"Your attitude is a killer."

312
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:31,396
"it steals my heart."

313
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:41,907
"Your attitude is a killer."

314
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:47,118
"it steals my heart."

315
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:52,873
"If I make up my mind, I can
elope with you right now."

316
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:55,668
"Try to understand that you're mine."

317
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:59,765
"I'm trying to explain to you."

318
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:04,557
"Let's lock eyes."

319
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:10,025
"Fall in love like me."

320
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:16,524
"I'll always be your beloved."

321
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:22,822
"I am in love with you."

322
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:36,709
See. This is what you call culture.

323
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:37,836
Tradition.

324
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:40,339
Get up, son. Get up.

325
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:42,925
You took my blessings
in the morning, son.

326
00:30:42,926 --> 00:30:45,217
- Why do it again?
- Culture, aunt. Our culture.

327
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,345
See. Learn something.

328
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:49,347
Do one thing for me, son.

329
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:52,558
Get a nappy pack
from the mall close-by.

330
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,982
- Happy?
- Children's underwear.

331
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:57,113
Okay.

332
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:02,026
Pappu, the traffic is really bad.

333
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:03,153
This is really bothering.

334
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,698
I am on my way, will be
there in half an hour.

335
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:07,286
Half..

336
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:10,743
Where's my phone? I was
holding it in my hands.

337
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:12,542
What's happening with me these days?

338
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,541
What's this, Shiva?

339
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:18,167
You're looking for
children's underwear..

340
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:19,795
For the sake of a girl.

341
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:22,880
"Children are devils."

342
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,259
"Why does God create children?"

343
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:30,763
I've been barking like a
dog and you're not replying.

344
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:31,979
- That was you?
- Yes.

345
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,475
I thought it was a dog barking.

346
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,186
I am hurt.

347
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,901
- I am leaving in a fit of rage.
- Go.

348
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,318
Thief. Thief.

349
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,366
Stop.

350
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,365
Catch him. He's my boss.

351
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:51,951
I am not with him.

352
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:53,670
I don't know him.

353
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:57,253
Brother.. brother..

354
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:04,427
Why did you take my name?

355
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:07,225
- What is this?
- Thief. Thief. Thief.

356
00:32:07,226 --> 00:32:08,801
- Thief.
- Thief.

357
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:10,804
Brother! Brother!

358
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:15,483
Brother!

359
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:20,446
Oh, my God!

360
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,868
Brother!

361
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:27,867
Brother! Brother!

362
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:30,661
Brother!

363
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:34,745
Brother!

364
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:38,256
Brother!

365
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,089
Brother.

366
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:44,221
Brother!

367
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:04,737
Don't worry, he's out of danger now.

368
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:12,082
I've left your bag at the reception.

369
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:18,546
Stop staring at me.

370
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,507
I've paid your bill.

371
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:30,217
Paro's upstairs.

372
00:33:30,218 --> 00:33:31,434
My girlfriend.

373
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,033
What did you just do?
Aren't you ashamed?

374
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:58,621
I tried to stop my hands.
But they didn't listen.

375
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:07,637
You always lose control where
you should be behaving yourself.

376
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,014
You're useless.

377
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:49,592
If you keep following me
around then what about your work?

378
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:53,471
There's nothing more
important than you.

379
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:58,226
Tell me something. What do you do?

380
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:06,563
I am a thief.

381
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:11,318
I commit thefts.

382
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:12,820
I con people.

383
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,621
I could've lied to you.

384
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:24,919
But I didn't do so.

385
00:35:25,707 --> 00:35:29,337
Because I want us to start
our new life with the truth.

386
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:35,012
You told me the truth, I liked that.

387
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:38,520
Promise me that you
will stop stealing.

388
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:41,390
I promise. I will stop all
wrong activities from tomorrow.

389
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:42,724
Thank you, Shiva.

390
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:45,064
You're strongly welcome.

391
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:47,227
Not so strong, Shiva.

392
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,320
Sorry.

393
00:35:55,028 --> 00:35:56,871
Drive faster. Faster.

394
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:04,078
Titla.

395
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:08,666
The village reporter has published..

396
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:12,171
That maybe Vikram Rathore is alive.

397
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:16,220
Happiness will return to
the village once again.

398
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:20,141
Where does the reporter stays?

399
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:51,168
Babu.

400
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:55,840
Take your men and go to Mumbai.

401
00:36:56,965 --> 00:37:02,392
But don't return without
Vikram Rathore's dead body.

402
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:10,102
That's my phone which
was stolen yesterday.

403
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:11,320
Yes!

404
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:13,105
Hey, Lord..

405
00:37:13,106 --> 00:37:15,700
Will you change your profession
from today for the sake of a girl?

406
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:17,615
Not today, from tomorrow.

407
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,070
But before that we'll
steal something big..

408
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:23,240
- Yes.
- So that we can lead the rest of our lives comfortably.

409
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,538
- Cool.
- Cool.

410
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,381
Madam, the box is very heavy.

411
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:43,012
Of course it is. It contains
jewelry for all seven days.

412
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:51,018
Keep it.

413
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:52,191
Thank you, madam.

414
00:37:52,192 --> 00:37:55,031
Hey. No, she isn't human.
She's Goddess Laxmi.

415
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,028
Excuse me.

416
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,406
Yes.

417
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:07,456
I can see thieves and
robbers in the entire station.

418
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,996
Only you two look decent.

419
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:13,876
- Can you help me?
- Just a minute.

420
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:25,016
Thieves. We look decent.

421
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:31,351
Come on.

422
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:35,896
You're right.

423
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:39,026
You'll never find decent
people like us anywhere.

424
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,860
I've to go to the bathroom.

425
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:44,196
Will you look after my box?

426
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:47,032
We'll look after it like our own.

427
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,285
Thank you, brother.

428
00:38:48,286 --> 00:38:50,082
Go on. You can go to the bathroom.

429
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:01,547
Who'll lift this box?

430
00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:02,845
I will.

431
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:10,264
Now, say 'Open
Sesame' and open the box.

432
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:12,359
- Open it.
- Wait, wait!

433
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,143
Let's talk about our share
only then will we open the box.

434
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:16,519
What's there to talk about it?

435
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,362
Like always we'll
divide it into three shares.

436
00:39:18,363 --> 00:39:19,608
You, me and Lord Kishan.

437
00:39:19,609 --> 00:39:21,650
No, there'll be just two shares.

438
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:23,367
- There'll be three shares.
- Two.

439
00:39:23,368 --> 00:39:25,828
- There'll be three shares.
- There'll be two shares.

440
00:39:25,829 --> 00:39:27,039
There'll be three shares.

441
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:32,003
- I said there'll be three.
- Only two shares.

442
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:36,290
- Listen..
- Only two shares.

443
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:38,760
- I said three..
- Two..

444
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:41,588
Kung-fu.

445
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,013
Where did you steal the box from?

446
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:49,011
- This..
- Belongs to us.

447
00:39:49,012 --> 00:39:52,733
I see. But your face
doesn't match with this box.

448
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:55,227
- What?
- They don't match.

449
00:39:55,228 --> 00:39:56,318
What's inside?

450
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:57,987
- Television.
- Clothes.

451
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,564
Clothes for television.

452
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:01,779
Open it.

453
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:04,903
- Why open it?
- I said, open it.

454
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:06,870
Open it.

455
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:08,998
Shiva.

456
00:40:09,616 --> 00:40:11,243
Will we open it for just anyone?

457
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:14,917
Wait, I'll deal with him.

458
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:17,131
Why should we open this box?

459
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:22,127
If you don't trust us then
why should we believe you..

460
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:24,256
That you really are the police.

461
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,466
Come. Come, come, come.

462
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:29,060
Which police station?

463
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:34,266
Vishal Sharma. Do you have a warrant?

464
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:41,773
- Do you still need a warrant?
- No. no.

465
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:43,195
Say no.

466
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:50,990
Open the box or he'll
blow our brains out.

467
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:09,683
I see.

468
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:13,136
You've kidnapped the
child and taking her along.

469
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:14,434
Me?

470
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:27,534
Papa.

471
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:30,454
Papa?

472
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:34,705
You were going to
sell your own daughter?

473
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:40,789
No, Inspector. The heat's very strong.

474
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:42,586
That's why I kept my
daughter in this trunk..

475
00:41:42,587 --> 00:41:43,800
So that she gets the shade.

476
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,342
Yes.

477
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:49,598
Where do you two stay?

478
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:52,306
Malad west, Teli Alley, room no. 28.

479
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:56,602
Fine, I'll come every
day to check on you.

480
00:41:57,056 --> 00:42:00,310
And if I don't see the child..

481
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:05,193
She's your daughter.

482
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:08,075
Raise her like one.

483
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:30,427
Fraud woman.

484
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:33,175
We thought that we conned her.

485
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:34,723
But who got conned?

486
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:47,360
Who was that woman?

487
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:49,321
Ask your daughter.

488
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:53,408
Come here.

489
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:55,031
Come here. Come here.

490
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:56,453
Come here.

491
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:01,500
- Who is your papa?
- You.

492
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,581
Papa, the house is really nice.

493
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:05,916
You liked it.

494
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:07,885
The bathroom's even better.
Go, check it.

495
00:43:07,886 --> 00:43:09,419
Okay, papa. Fine, papa.

496
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,512
My daughter.

497
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,714
What love between father-daughter?

498
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:14,299
She can't be my daughter.

499
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,802
Think about it. All the
affairs that you've had.

500
00:43:16,803 --> 00:43:19,397
She belongs to someone else.

501
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:23,480
"Papa?" Now watch what I do?

502
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:27,438
Sit quietly.

503
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:33,949
I'm very short-tempered.

504
00:43:34,487 --> 00:43:36,114
I'm asking you for the last time.

505
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:39,241
Tell me.. who is your papa?

506
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:40,960
You are my Dalia...

507
00:43:43,663 --> 00:43:46,007
She's playing games with me.

508
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:48,960
Come on, let's play hide and seek.

509
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:58,635
Don't come out, until I
don't call you. Go and hide, go.

510
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,104
- Hurry up. Quickly.
- Okay, papa.

511
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:11,070
Before both of them con you,
better get going 2G.

512
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:16,617
You'll die after 100 years, sir.

513
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:19,030
I was just thinking about you.

514
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:20,157
Come.. in.

515
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:22,543
He's here.

516
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:24,996
What's all this?

517
00:44:25,705 --> 00:44:28,834
It's an old piece, sir.
We can't afford new ones.

518
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:30,380
Where is Shiva?

519
00:44:30,381 --> 00:44:31,468
Sir.

520
00:44:32,253 --> 00:44:33,425
Sir.

521
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:35,302
Sir..

522
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:39,926
He's gone to get a cake.
It's his daughter's birthday.

523
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:41,099
I see.

524
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:44,098
Then I'll leave only after
eating the cake. - No, sir.

525
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:47,142
Why not, sir? Take a seat.

526
00:44:47,143 --> 00:44:48,770
I'll call Shiva.

527
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:50,897
Yes, take a seat.

528
00:44:51,981 --> 00:44:53,278
Wonder when he'll come.

529
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:56,485
He doesn't know you're here.

530
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,703
- Hello.
- Shiva.

531
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:05,535
- Today's your daughter's birthday.
- Birthday?

532
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:08,622
Yes. The Inspector's
here for the cake.

533
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:10,500
- What?
- Come quickly with the cake.

534
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:13,670
Why's he after me?

535
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,012
Hey!

536
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:21,885
Hey truck driver. Hey. Stop.

537
00:45:21,886 --> 00:45:25,766
- Papa.
- Stop, stop. Stop.

538
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:29,356
Papa.

539
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:31,521
Come on, come on.

540
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:41,114
Shiva. Sir, Shiva's here.

541
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:43,783
Shiva. Balloons. Cakes.

542
00:45:44,033 --> 00:45:46,161
Daughter. Papa. Birthday.

543
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:47,794
Very good.

544
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:49,664
Nice.

545
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:52,333
Father and daughter
really love each other.

546
00:45:54,794 --> 00:45:56,091
I will come again.

547
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,348
I'll come every day.

548
00:45:59,799 --> 00:46:01,508
And if you're up to something..

549
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:02,717
Be careful.

550
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:05,267
- What did you say?
- I said to myself, sir.

551
00:46:08,975 --> 00:46:10,192
Carefully.

552
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:19,405
- Bye, sir.
- Bye.

553
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:22,784
Why are you making me so tired?

554
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:26,241
I cannot endure this tension.

555
00:46:26,242 --> 00:46:27,784
I am leaving. Give it.

556
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,537
Hey. You, rascal.

557
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:31,630
- Is Shiva home?
- Yes, he's inside.

558
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:34,963
- Shiva?
- Oh, God. Paro.

559
00:46:38,087 --> 00:46:40,213
- Let's play hide and seek.
- Shiva?

560
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:41,887
- Go and hide inside.
- Okay, papa.

561
00:46:41,888 --> 00:46:43,976
Why does she say "Okay papa"?

562
00:46:48,681 --> 00:46:50,934
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

563
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:59,149
- Who's in the bedroom?
- No one.

564
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:00,276
Then why did you stop me?

565
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:04,621
You're ready to go to
the bedroom so soon.

566
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:06,990
- Let's go.
- Leave me..

567
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:08,707
- No, please. Let's go.
- Leave me, Shiva.

568
00:47:08,708 --> 00:47:09,918
Why are you pulling me?

569
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:13,002
- What is it?
- Paro.

570
00:47:13,873 --> 00:47:15,081
Shiva.

571
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:16,959
- Paro.
- Shiva.

572
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:19,344
- What is wrong with you?
- Paro.

573
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:22,010
Hide.

574
00:47:22,465 --> 00:47:23,591
Hide.

575
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:25,058
"Hide."

576
00:47:25,426 --> 00:47:29,596
"Hide away and.."

577
00:47:29,597 --> 00:47:31,598
"No, no, it's come in my arms."

578
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,852
Very intelligent.

579
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,769
Very intelligent.

580
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:41,566
"Hide away and I.."

581
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:43,569
- Not so strong, Shiva.
- Darling.

582
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:45,447
Darling.

583
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,202
Darling.

584
00:47:48,491 --> 00:47:50,825
- Let's go and talk about love.
- Where?

585
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:52,043
On the streets.

586
00:47:52,044 --> 00:47:53,754
On the streets? No, no.

587
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:56,132
- At the station.
- It's too noisy.

588
00:47:56,916 --> 00:47:58,259
It's too noisy.

589
00:47:58,709 --> 00:47:59,961
Out if India?

590
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:02,545
There's no feeling, Shiva.

591
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:03,880
In India with the goats?

592
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:04,928
This is fine.

593
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:28,622
"Your love's fiery."

594
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:32,450
"I like it fiery."

595
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:35,995
"Your love's painful."

596
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:39,125
"I like the pain."

597
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:45,424
"Your love's a lie."

598
00:48:48,426 --> 00:48:51,886
"Your love's a lie."

599
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:55,266
"I like lies."

600
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:16,612
"I've lost my heart to
your attitude, your smile."

601
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:24,502
"I only pray for you."

602
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:31,634
"My heaven lies where you are."

603
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:38,308
"I find refuge only with you."

604
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:41,728
"Your love's sour."

605
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:45,154
"I like sour."

606
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:48,577
"Your love's painful."

607
00:49:48,736 --> 00:49:52,081
"I like the pain."

608
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:04,918
"Your love's a lie."

609
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:08,389
"I like lies."

610
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:29,826
What are you doing?

611
00:50:29,827 --> 00:50:32,947
I'm trying to find out who this
girl is and where did she come from?

612
00:50:33,197 --> 00:50:34,870
And, anyway if Paro
finds out about her..

613
00:50:34,871 --> 00:50:36,492
It'll jeopardize my love story.

614
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:59,606
Wow. The mustache looks awesome.
Why did you cut them?

615
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,725
That's not me, you fool.
He's the girl's father.

616
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,148
He looks like me.

617
00:51:04,353 --> 00:51:06,572
That's why this girl
keeps calling me papa.

618
00:51:06,939 --> 00:51:08,566
But how will we find him?

619
00:51:09,692 --> 00:51:13,822
No, we'll have to find him.

620
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:26,588
He must be somewhere. Scoundrel.

621
00:51:39,138 --> 00:51:42,483
How many will you kill?
There're 50 of us. 50.

622
00:51:42,725 --> 00:51:45,899
We won't leave without
killing you and your daughter.

623
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:50,574
Forget about touching my daughter..

624
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:55,788
Even if anyone thinks
about it, I will kill him.

625
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:27,941
- Brother. Brother.
- Go, look that side.

626
00:52:28,312 --> 00:52:29,564
Vikram Rathore. There he is.

627
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:31,198
That way. He's that way.

628
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:35,818
Where is he? - He was right here.
He was running after me.

629
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,787
- Where is he?
- He was right here.

630
00:52:40,324 --> 00:52:42,543
Where did he go? He was right here.

631
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:45,078
- I had seen him right here.
- Where is he?

632
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:46,672
He was right here. I
saw him Right here.

633
00:52:46,673 --> 00:52:49,999
Let's go. - Brother,
Vikram Rathore is this way..

634
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,085
I said I'll send you
two crores by evening.

635
00:52:52,086 --> 00:52:53,338
- Excuse me.
- Disconnect the phone now.

636
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:56,010
- What is it?
- Have you seen this man?

637
00:53:01,804 --> 00:53:04,603
He's with you, and
you're inquiring about him.

638
00:53:05,808 --> 00:53:08,059
Today I realized why they
announce on television..

639
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:09,275
"Always wear helmets".

640
00:53:09,276 --> 00:53:11,565
Sit behind me quietly.
We'll look somewhere else.

641
00:53:11,566 --> 00:53:13,907
- I've been slapped five times.
- Okay, sit quietly.

642
00:53:13,908 --> 00:53:17,153
Either buy a helmet or find
her father alone. - Be quiet.

643
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:25,710
Rascal.

644
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:58,234
Try to understand, Mr. Vikram.

645
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:00,488
The injury to your
brain is quite serious.

646
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:03,623
Any minor shock can kill you.

647
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:06,618
If you hadn't found water..

648
00:54:07,286 --> 00:54:09,539
The nerves of your brain
could've burst under pressure.

649
00:54:09,997 --> 00:54:11,999
And you could've
suffered brain hemorrhage.

650
00:54:14,293 --> 00:54:15,886
I hope you understand.

651
00:54:42,196 --> 00:54:43,573
Here, eat it.

652
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:46,996
What happened?

653
00:54:47,201 --> 00:54:48,917
- You're hungry, aren't you?
- Yes.

654
00:54:48,918 --> 00:54:50,333
So why don't you eat? Eat it.

655
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:54,167
Feed me like you always do, papa.

656
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:58,382
There she goes again.

657
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:01,302
My hands are injured.

658
00:55:01,507 --> 00:55:03,350
I cannot feed you, understand.

659
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:04,889
Eat it yourself.

660
00:55:28,909 --> 00:55:30,582
All the time "Papa, papa".

661
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:32,504
- What should I do with her?
- Papa.

662
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:40,004
- What is it?
- Your hands are injured, aren't they?

663
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:43,382
I'll feed you.

664
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,264
I am not hungry.

665
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:51,856
You go and eat.

666
00:55:52,391 --> 00:55:53,517
Go.

667
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:56,524
Go. Go.

668
00:56:17,416 --> 00:56:19,635
Eat your food, or throw it away.

669
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:50,324
You'll rest and spoil my slumber.

670
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:56,585
You didn't eat your food.

671
00:56:58,624 --> 00:56:59,921
Don't eat.

672
00:57:00,876 --> 00:57:04,881
Whether you eat or you don't,
it's not my fault.

673
00:57:05,047 --> 00:57:06,890
Your father's to be blamed for this.

674
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:08,517
He left you here.

675
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:10,556
And who's suffering.

676
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:12,683
Listen carefully.

677
00:57:13,597 --> 00:57:16,271
We're not related. Understand.

678
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:19,107
We're not related.

679
00:57:28,654 --> 00:57:29,746
Be quiet.

680
00:57:30,322 --> 00:57:31,949
We're having a conversation. Be quiet.

681
00:57:34,201 --> 00:57:35,327
Did you hear?

682
00:57:36,036 --> 00:57:37,162
Quiet.

683
00:57:37,913 --> 00:57:39,130
Quiet.

684
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,843
No relation..

685
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:47,047
Silence.

686
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:53,100
Look at her.. how she's resting.

687
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:19,546
You've started crying in the morning.

688
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:24,500
What's wrong now? Why are you crying?

689
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:28,222
It's broken, papa. Mother's silent.

690
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:39,228
Give it to me.

691
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:12,678
Thank you, Papa...

692
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,220
Come on. Eat it.

693
00:59:59,221 --> 01:00:01,349
- Papa, this is the last one.
- Okay, last.

694
01:00:01,807 --> 01:00:04,902
That's it.

695
01:00:07,479 --> 01:00:08,571
Papa.

696
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:25,713
You said that you're a thief.

697
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,296
Still I fell in love with you.

698
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,428
You said that I don't like children.

699
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:36,224
I accepted that as well.

700
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:38,809
And now..

701
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:42,893
You have a child as well.

702
01:00:43,265 --> 01:00:46,235
- No, Paro, the truth is..
- The truth is..

703
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:48,982
Your love was a fake.

704
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:52,740
You cheated me.

705
01:00:56,111 --> 01:00:57,579
- Pa..
- Papa.

706
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:01,617
- Papa will be right back, okay.
- Okay, papa.

707
01:01:02,951 --> 01:01:04,043
Paro

708
01:01:04,286 --> 01:01:05,412
Paro

709
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:07,789
It's not like you think.

710
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:10,842
That child is calling you papa.

711
01:01:11,251 --> 01:01:13,128
What else will you explain to me?

712
01:01:13,879 --> 01:01:15,963
I brought my parents
here to introduce to you.

713
01:01:15,964 --> 01:01:18,012
To tell you that I am
going back to Patna.

714
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:20,764
But you.. You've ruined everything.

715
01:01:20,969 --> 01:01:24,815
- Look, Paro, I can prove that..
- What else will you prove?

716
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:30,060
- Paro, listen to me.
- Look, mister.

717
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:32,780
We don't want to
listen to you. Let's go.

718
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:19,402
Papa.

719
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:28,420
Shiva, go away from here.

720
01:02:29,454 --> 01:02:31,377
Leave with Chinki.

721
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:34,835
Run, or else they will kill her.

722
01:02:54,938 --> 01:02:57,908
Who are you? Why do
you want to kill us?

723
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:20,304
Run, Shiva. Run.

724
01:03:21,006 --> 01:03:23,008
Run, Shiva.

725
01:03:50,035 --> 01:03:51,378
Oh, no.

726
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:54,038
Brother.

727
01:03:54,039 --> 01:03:55,211
Run, brother.

728
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:59,006
Run, brother.

729
01:04:04,466 --> 01:04:06,059
Run, brother.

730
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:21,987
Chinki.

731
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,254
Look at this coward.

732
01:04:42,754 --> 01:04:46,475
Look at him shivering at
the sight of his death.

733
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:51,970
The other day he was saying proudly..

734
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:54,190
"I am not scared of death".

735
01:04:54,557 --> 01:05:01,315
It's easy to say, but
when the time comes..

736
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:03,983
Come on. Come on!

737
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:14,350
Whoever thought that I am scared..

738
01:06:15,054 --> 01:06:17,682
Never saw daylight again.

739
01:06:18,016 --> 01:06:19,768
Rathore.

740
01:06:20,143 --> 01:06:22,396
Vikram Rathore.

741
01:06:23,771 --> 01:06:25,068
I am not scared.

742
01:06:26,024 --> 01:06:27,617
Death is scared of me.

743
01:06:28,485 --> 01:06:32,706
Death can't look me in the eye.

744
01:06:32,947 --> 01:06:37,953
That's why it's been following
me around for the past six months.

745
01:06:39,037 --> 01:06:45,670
Death will have to come
through all you rascals to take me.

746
01:06:54,552 --> 01:06:56,261
I swear on my daughter..

747
01:06:56,262 --> 01:07:03,271
If any of you survive,
or I die before any of you.

748
01:07:03,603 --> 01:07:05,896
Then first shave off my mustache..

749
01:07:05,897 --> 01:07:08,275
And then bury me in the ground.

750
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:10,243
Come on!

751
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:11,615
Come on!

752
01:08:11,004 --> 01:08:12,347
Sir!

753
01:08:43,036 --> 01:08:44,788
Sir!

754
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:49,838
Sir!

755
01:09:43,721 --> 01:09:44,813
Sir!

756
01:11:47,929 --> 01:11:50,523
- Officers!
- Sir.

757
01:11:51,015 --> 01:11:53,017
Is there anyone left?

758
01:11:53,518 --> 01:11:55,316
No, sir.

759
01:11:55,770 --> 01:12:00,357
I always do.. what I say.

760
01:12:00,358 --> 01:12:01,905
Yes, sir.

761
01:12:36,811 --> 01:12:39,030
Doctor. How is she?

762
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:40,772
Well, she's fine.

763
01:12:40,773 --> 01:12:42,616
She fell unconscious due to the shock.

764
01:12:42,617 --> 01:12:45,452
Don't you worry. She'll
regain consciousness in a while.

765
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:49,741
- Doctor.
- Yes?

766
01:12:50,533 --> 01:12:53,833
The injury is serious.
But we're trying our best.

767
01:13:04,839 --> 01:13:09,676
I know, there must be
many questions in your mind.

768
01:13:09,677 --> 01:13:15,901
That, why are you getting
into one problem after another.

769
01:13:16,767 --> 01:13:19,603
Or, who's that man..

770
01:13:19,604 --> 01:13:24,608
Who's fighting between
life and death in the ICU.

771
01:13:24,609 --> 01:13:28,236
One doesn't need to have 100
years of life to live for 100 years.

772
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:30,614
Just do something..

773
01:13:30,615 --> 01:13:33,950
For which the world
remembers you for 100 years.

774
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:36,124
I didn't say this..

775
01:13:38,164 --> 01:13:39,791
He did.

776
01:13:41,292 --> 01:13:45,593
He's equal to a 100 armed policemen.

777
01:13:53,888 --> 01:13:56,348
Assistant Superintendent of Police.

778
01:13:56,349 --> 01:13:57,601
Vikram Rathore.

779
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:06,484
This happened..6 months ago.

780
01:14:07,693 --> 01:14:11,529
There's a small town
near Patna, Devgarh.

781
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:14,324
A landlord called Baapji,
ruled that place.

782
01:14:14,325 --> 01:14:16,953
The entire city was
living like slaves.

783
01:14:17,536 --> 01:14:22,417
The police uniform was just
another cloth to cover the body.

784
01:14:23,834 --> 01:14:29,967
Even I was.. one of those
helpless police officers.

785
01:14:45,898 --> 01:14:48,650
'Sanctity to the soul.'

786
01:14:48,651 --> 01:14:50,403
Glory to You.

787
01:14:57,243 --> 01:14:58,586
Greetings, Baapji.

788
01:15:00,204 --> 01:15:01,997
Why did you come here?

789
01:15:01,998 --> 01:15:03,045
Say it.

790
01:15:08,045 --> 01:15:09,337
Say it.

791
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:11,761
My wife's been missing for
the past two days, Baapji.

792
01:15:12,425 --> 01:15:14,553
Wife's missing?

793
01:15:15,052 --> 01:15:17,396
Didn't you take care of her?

794
01:15:17,805 --> 01:15:20,058
Seems like you didn't
look after her needs.

795
01:15:29,608 --> 01:15:32,657
- Your wife's age?
- 30 years.

796
01:15:33,154 --> 01:15:34,487
30!

797
01:15:34,488 --> 01:15:39,494
Inspector, you should take
special care of women at two ages.

798
01:15:39,702 --> 01:15:42,912
First, when she's 17.

799
01:15:42,913 --> 01:15:46,041
That's a very dangerous age.

800
01:15:46,042 --> 01:15:51,838
And when woman turns 30, she matures.

801
01:15:51,839 --> 01:15:56,640
People even steal ripe mangoes
from their brother's orchard.

802
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:00,638
Papa. Mother. There.

803
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:02,515
Papa, look. Its mother.

804
01:16:02,516 --> 01:16:05,269
Papa. Its mother.

805
01:16:05,853 --> 01:16:07,270
Mother. Papa.

806
01:16:07,271 --> 01:16:08,563
Papa. Mother.

807
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:10,783
Mother. Mother.

808
01:16:11,108 --> 01:16:13,327
Papa, look. Its mother.

809
01:16:14,737 --> 01:16:20,119
Baapji, find my wife.

810
01:16:24,705 --> 01:16:26,753
Do you know where she is?

811
01:16:29,418 --> 01:16:30,627
No, Baapji

812
01:16:30,628 --> 01:16:32,722
Do you doubt anyone?

813
01:16:33,339 --> 01:16:34,932
No, Baapji

814
01:16:37,301 --> 01:16:41,056
Fine, we'll find
your wife in two days.

815
01:16:43,390 --> 01:16:46,309
But my.. - Like I said,
we'll find her in two days.

816
01:16:46,310 --> 01:16:47,562
Go back.

817
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:10,051
- Where are you going, darling?
- Where are you going?

818
01:17:15,965 --> 01:17:18,093
Get the fruits.

819
01:17:19,218 --> 01:17:20,344
Yes.

820
01:17:21,554 --> 01:17:24,180
- It's here.
- Get it quickly.
- Come on.

821
01:17:24,181 --> 01:17:25,307
Get it.

822
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:27,642
Sir, money.

823
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:29,227
Money. Get lost.

824
01:17:29,228 --> 01:17:31,229
You call this a salad.

825
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:33,940
Next time don't forget to
add watermelon and mangoes.

826
01:17:33,941 --> 01:17:35,739
Hey, crippled. Shell out the money.

827
01:17:37,570 --> 01:17:39,413
Be quick. Give me.

828
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:41,114
What are you looking at?

829
01:17:41,115 --> 01:17:43,664
Get lost. What are you staring at?

830
01:17:44,785 --> 01:17:46,253
Don't worry, Somu.

831
01:17:47,997 --> 01:17:49,499
One day everything will be fine.

832
01:17:56,213 --> 01:17:57,305
Porter.

833
01:18:01,719 --> 01:18:03,344
Do you want a taxi, sir?

834
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:05,972
- Where do you want to go?
- Palki Chowk.

835
01:18:05,973 --> 01:18:10,393
The fare will be 500 Rs.

836
01:18:10,394 --> 01:18:11,691
But Palki Chowk is close-by.

837
01:18:11,692 --> 01:18:15,157
Don't argue in
Baapji's city. Understand.

838
01:18:16,066 --> 01:18:17,192
I don't want to go.

839
01:18:17,943 --> 01:18:20,236
Whether you want to go
or not, but you asked.

840
01:18:20,237 --> 01:18:23,286
- Come on, shell out the money.
- Pay them, sir. Don't argue.

841
01:18:24,158 --> 01:18:25,455
Get it out.

842
01:18:27,453 --> 01:18:29,296
Give it here.

843
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:34,417
Sir, did you only
bring the child along?

844
01:18:34,418 --> 01:18:37,629
- Where is her mother?
- Let me take a look.

845
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:42,136
Looking at the child, I can say
that her mother must be quite a thing.

846
01:18:44,762 --> 01:18:47,680
Sir. Is she arriving
by the next train?

847
01:18:47,681 --> 01:18:53,019
Seems like you're
eagerly waiting for her.

848
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:55,021
- Come, sir.
- Sir..

849
01:18:55,022 --> 01:18:58,743
At least tell me. By which
train is your wife arriving?

850
01:19:03,822 --> 01:19:05,240
Listen to the music.

851
01:19:05,241 --> 01:19:07,659
I'll be right back.

852
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:10,038
- Okay?
- Okay.

853
01:19:18,504 --> 01:19:20,472
He's coming. Again.

854
01:19:20,714 --> 01:19:22,967
What? You have come to
show your wife's photo?

855
01:19:24,593 --> 01:19:26,386
Who is it? Who is it?

856
01:19:26,387 --> 01:19:28,096
Do you know who you just hit?

857
01:19:28,097 --> 01:19:30,807
Bheema. You just hit Bheema.

858
01:19:30,808 --> 01:19:32,230
Where are you? Where are you?

859
01:19:32,685 --> 01:19:34,107
Where is he?

860
01:19:42,319 --> 01:19:43,662
Hello, sir.

861
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:48,705
Where am I?

862
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:12,557
Sir.

863
01:20:12,558 --> 01:20:15,357
- I've to go urgently.
- Me too.

864
01:20:15,519 --> 01:20:18,773
I will come in two minutes,
sir. I swear, sir.

865
01:20:31,785 --> 01:20:33,036
Stand up.

866
01:20:33,037 --> 01:20:34,954
Wear your clothes.

867
01:20:34,955 --> 01:20:36,957
Give me money.

868
01:20:41,545 --> 01:20:43,593
You taught them a nice lesson, sir.

869
01:20:44,214 --> 01:20:45,590
But who are you?

870
01:20:45,591 --> 01:20:47,764
The new ASP of your city.

871
01:20:48,344 --> 01:20:50,017
Vikram Rathore.

872
01:20:53,599 --> 01:20:55,943
Don't be scared. Take this money.

873
01:20:56,268 --> 01:20:58,978
And return it to
everyone they extorted it from.

874
01:20:58,979 --> 01:21:00,276
Okay.

875
01:21:04,651 --> 01:21:07,700
If I ever see you again..

876
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:09,532
Run!

877
01:21:14,703 --> 01:21:15,795
Sir.

878
01:21:16,330 --> 01:21:17,923
Inspector Razia Khan.

879
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:21,172
Welcome to Devgarh, sir.

880
01:21:21,502 --> 01:21:22,754
Inspector Vishal.

881
01:21:23,003 --> 01:21:25,256
Sorry, sir. I couldn't come
and receive you. - It's okay.

882
01:21:25,257 --> 01:21:28,674
Papa. My doll's asleep.
What should I do'?

883
01:21:28,675 --> 01:21:30,051
Put her to sleep. Go.

884
01:21:30,052 --> 01:21:31,144
Okay. Papa.

885
01:21:32,846 --> 01:21:34,314
Your wife didn't come along, sir.

886
01:21:41,855 --> 01:21:43,107
I am sorry, sir.

887
01:21:44,608 --> 01:21:48,277
Papa, let's go quickly.
We're getting late for school.

888
01:21:48,278 --> 01:21:50,201
Okay. - Papa, you
didn't comb my hair either.

889
01:21:50,202 --> 01:21:51,864
The teacher will scold me.

890
01:21:51,865 --> 01:21:54,992
Is your wife.. dead..

891
01:21:54,993 --> 01:21:57,286
No. Our mother is alive..

892
01:21:57,287 --> 01:22:00,456
Okay. Fine, sir. See you.

893
01:22:00,457 --> 01:22:02,050
- Let's go. Come on.
- But, papa..

894
01:22:02,051 --> 01:22:03,134
Just a minute.

895
01:22:12,094 --> 01:22:13,971
What happened to your wife?

896
01:23:22,122 --> 01:23:25,467
Who are you? I told you,
two days. Leave.

897
01:23:53,403 --> 01:23:55,576
Leave me. Leave me.

898
01:23:57,824 --> 01:24:00,327
Leave my son. Stop.

899
01:24:01,495 --> 01:24:03,543
You don't know me.

900
01:24:03,956 --> 01:24:06,666
I'll peel off your skin
along with your uniform.

901
01:24:06,667 --> 01:24:07,959
Do it.

902
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:09,210
Peel it off.

903
01:24:09,211 --> 01:24:10,337
Do it.

904
01:24:11,463 --> 01:24:15,013
You can't even touch my hair.

905
01:24:15,467 --> 01:24:17,344
You just brag.

906
01:24:18,136 --> 01:24:21,857
I always do.. what I say.

907
01:24:22,349 --> 01:24:23,942
Rathore.

908
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:31,566
Close it. Close the gates.

909
01:24:31,567 --> 01:24:33,234
Don't let him go.

910
01:24:33,235 --> 01:24:34,735
Close it.

911
01:24:34,736 --> 01:24:36,363
Get in the car..

912
01:24:37,072 --> 01:24:40,326
Close it quickly. Quickly.

913
01:24:40,784 --> 01:24:43,754
What are you doing? Let him go.

914
01:24:50,127 --> 01:24:52,128
Open it. Open the gate!

915
01:24:52,129 --> 01:24:54,006
Open the gate!

916
01:25:08,228 --> 01:25:09,345
DGP Prakash, here.

917
01:25:09,438 --> 01:25:10,510
Prakash..

918
01:25:10,606 --> 01:25:12,429
- Do you want to cause riots in the city?
- What happened, sir?

919
01:25:12,524 --> 01:25:15,359
One of your inspectors
has arrested Baapji's son.

920
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:17,361
Leave him right now. Don't mind.

921
01:25:17,362 --> 01:25:20,707
- Law and order..
- Baapji's law and order himself.

922
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:23,418
Look. You can die if you want,
but I want to live.

923
01:25:23,419 --> 01:25:24,957
Understand. Disconnect it.

924
01:25:25,954 --> 01:25:27,163
Don't mind.

925
01:25:27,164 --> 01:25:28,711
Who is this Vikram Rathore?

926
01:25:29,082 --> 01:25:32,336
That minister is abusing
us for that wannabe hero.

927
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:35,969
Nonsense. File. Get his file.

928
01:25:59,071 --> 01:26:01,745
- Quite impressive!
- He's a fearless police officer, sir.

929
01:26:02,532 --> 01:26:03,704
Where can I find him?

930
01:26:08,121 --> 01:26:09,288
Sir.

931
01:26:09,289 --> 01:26:10,541
At ease.

932
01:26:11,625 --> 01:26:13,377
Office Vikram Rathore.

933
01:26:14,670 --> 01:26:16,138
I read your file.

934
01:26:16,421 --> 01:26:17,764
I'm impressed.

935
01:26:18,006 --> 01:26:21,385
Four promotions and ten
transfers in four years.

936
01:26:21,635 --> 01:26:23,888
No compromise.

937
01:26:25,055 --> 01:26:26,307
Very good record.

938
01:26:26,308 --> 01:26:29,776
But these medals, the
records are not a big thing.

939
01:26:30,769 --> 01:26:34,105
Other than all this, a
police officer should have fear..

940
01:26:34,106 --> 01:26:35,949
While doing his duty.

941
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:37,400
Think.

942
01:26:37,401 --> 01:26:40,027
You're sleeping on your bed
in the middle of the night.

943
01:26:40,028 --> 01:26:41,780
And there's a knock on your door.

944
01:26:41,988 --> 01:26:44,992
You get up from your bed and go
out and see there's no one outside.

945
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:49,171
To protect yourself, you come
inside and reach for your revolver.

946
01:26:49,871 --> 01:26:51,589
Only to notice that
the revolver is missing.

947
01:26:51,748 --> 01:26:55,298
All you can hear are the
goons laughing outside.

948
01:26:55,919 --> 01:26:58,388
The feeling you will sense
in your heart at that time..

949
01:26:58,797 --> 01:27:00,720
Do you know how that's going to be?

950
01:27:02,134 --> 01:27:05,138
In the evening, your daughter
doesn't return home from school.

951
01:27:05,554 --> 01:27:08,854
When you go to the school the
watchman says "She left long ago".

952
01:27:09,057 --> 01:27:12,231
You'll know what fear is
when the kidnapper calls you.

953
01:27:12,477 --> 01:27:14,605
Don't underestimate fear.

954
01:27:15,355 --> 01:27:17,028
Respect it.

955
01:27:18,024 --> 01:27:21,870
Those who are fearless, life
becomes difficult for them.

956
01:27:26,992 --> 01:27:29,962
How could you think
that I am not scared?

957
01:27:30,662 --> 01:27:34,582
I am scared every day, every moment.

958
01:27:34,583 --> 01:27:36,927
Five years ago when I took an oath..

959
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:43,305
I promised myself that I will
devote my entire life to my duty.

960
01:27:44,885 --> 01:27:48,095
Whether someone knocks on my door
in the middle of the night or not.

961
01:27:48,096 --> 01:27:50,931
Whether the kidnapper
calls up at 10:00 p.m. or not.

962
01:27:50,932 --> 01:27:54,560
But death.. death
will surely come for me.

963
01:27:54,561 --> 01:27:58,731
Every moment I fear that
when I am facing death..

964
01:27:58,732 --> 01:28:03,033
What if I fail to
fulfill my promise.

965
01:28:04,946 --> 01:28:09,952
Those who do illegal deeds,
they're always scared.

966
01:28:12,704 --> 01:28:14,297
Sir, if you don't mind.

967
01:28:14,623 --> 01:28:16,415
The time of my duty is over.

968
01:28:16,416 --> 01:28:18,635
My daughter is waiting for me at home.

969
01:28:26,968 --> 01:28:29,136
I've just one desire, sir.

970
01:28:29,137 --> 01:28:32,767
When I face death, I
shouldn't look scared.

971
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:38,193
I should be coffering my mustache,
with a smile on my face.

972
01:28:41,107 --> 01:28:44,907
Parade.. attention!

973
01:28:45,070 --> 01:28:47,994
Parade.. salute!

974
01:29:03,964 --> 01:29:07,716
According to the witnesses and
medical reports its confirmed..

975
01:29:07,717 --> 01:29:09,593
That Munna is mentally ill.

976
01:29:09,594 --> 01:29:13,097
And whatever happened wasn't planned,
but was a coincidence.

977
01:29:13,098 --> 01:29:16,809
So, the court acquits Munna.

978
01:29:16,810 --> 01:29:19,019
And warns the police..

979
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:23,867
That they shouldn't arrest
anyone without proper evidence.

980
01:29:40,667 --> 01:29:41,959
Baapji.

981
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:44,003
Are you happy with me now?

982
01:29:44,004 --> 01:29:47,725
Vikram Rathore has insulted me.

983
01:29:48,508 --> 01:29:51,427
I'm burning for revenge.

984
01:29:51,428 --> 01:29:53,647
We'll douse that fire, don't mind.

985
01:29:53,889 --> 01:29:57,349
I'll bring him at
tonight's party as my security.

986
01:29:57,350 --> 01:29:59,352
Then you can make him your dog.

987
01:30:03,148 --> 01:30:05,446
"Nonsense."

988
01:30:17,078 --> 01:30:20,164
- "Come..
- My darling."

989
01:30:20,165 --> 01:30:23,339
"Not the gun or the bullet."

990
01:30:29,049 --> 01:30:32,176
- "Come..
- My darling."

991
01:30:32,177 --> 01:30:35,220
"Not the gun or the bullet."

992
01:30:35,221 --> 01:30:38,223
- "Come..
- My darling."

993
01:30:38,224 --> 01:30:40,893
"The real heat's behind my veil."

994
01:30:40,894 --> 01:30:46,321
"Pick up the pipe, light it up."

995
01:30:47,025 --> 01:30:50,069
"I've hidden it under my veil."

996
01:30:50,070 --> 01:30:52,789
"There'll be chaos if I reveal it."

997
01:30:53,114 --> 01:30:56,033
"I've hidden it under my veil."

998
01:30:56,034 --> 01:30:59,254
"There'll be chaos if I reveal it."

999
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,923
"Nonsense."

1000
01:31:36,491 --> 01:31:39,576
"if I drop my veil."

1001
01:31:39,577 --> 01:31:43,298
"it brings a gin to
the face of youngsters."

1002
01:31:45,583 --> 01:31:48,669
"When I wink, money showers on me."

1003
01:31:48,670 --> 01:31:51,755
"When I speak, the
entire area trembles."

1004
01:31:51,756 --> 01:31:54,760
"The entire area trembles."

1005
01:31:57,762 --> 01:32:00,389
"The entire area trembles."

1006
01:32:00,390 --> 01:32:06,113
"Whistle along, shake a leg."

1007
01:32:06,688 --> 01:32:09,606
"I've hidden it under my veil."

1008
01:32:09,607 --> 01:32:12,568
"it'll be chaos if I show it."

1009
01:32:12,569 --> 01:32:15,529
"I've hidden it under my veil."

1010
01:32:15,530 --> 01:32:19,205
"it'll be chaos if I show it."

1011
01:32:50,065 --> 01:32:53,150
"I am a delicate deer of the jungle."

1012
01:32:53,151 --> 01:32:56,655
"And you're the feared hunter."

1013
01:32:58,698 --> 01:33:05,329
"You're the saw that cuts me cruelly."

1014
01:33:05,330 --> 01:33:08,300
"You're the saw."

1015
01:33:11,461 --> 01:33:14,046
"You're the saw."

1016
01:33:14,047 --> 01:33:19,349
"Don't show me your
money or your body."

1017
01:33:20,178 --> 01:33:23,222
"I've hidden it under my veil."

1018
01:33:23,223 --> 01:33:26,350
"There'll be chaos if I reveal it."

1019
01:33:26,351 --> 01:33:29,228
"I've hidden it under my veil."

1020
01:33:29,229 --> 01:33:31,948
"There'll be chaos if I reveal it."

1021
01:33:42,367 --> 01:33:44,836
"Nonsense."

1022
01:33:45,036 --> 01:33:48,705
- Welcome, minister.
- Baapji.

1023
01:33:48,706 --> 01:33:50,049
How are you?

1024
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:51,710
All thanks to you.

1025
01:33:52,043 --> 01:33:53,585
Bye, bye.

1026
01:33:53,586 --> 01:33:55,921
Minister uncle is here.
Minister uncle is here.

1027
01:33:55,922 --> 01:33:58,298
The song was very nice.

1028
01:33:58,299 --> 01:34:01,018
- But I still want to have more fun.
- I see.

1029
01:34:01,344 --> 01:34:04,221
Tell me, son. What kind of fun?

1030
01:34:04,222 --> 01:34:06,566
- I want to play catch and cook.
- I see.

1031
01:34:06,891 --> 01:34:09,226
With your policemen.

1032
01:34:09,227 --> 01:34:10,649
With the police here.

1033
01:34:11,312 --> 01:34:13,522
Whoever I catch..

1034
01:34:13,523 --> 01:34:17,118
Will take off his clothes.

1035
01:34:28,079 --> 01:34:29,705
Hey, officer.

1036
01:34:29,706 --> 01:34:31,290
Control your anger.

1037
01:34:31,291 --> 01:34:32,499
Don't mind.

1038
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:33,752
Actually, he's a mental patient.

1039
01:34:33,753 --> 01:34:37,462
If he plays with you for a
while it won't harm you in anyway.

1040
01:34:37,463 --> 01:34:39,932
And anyway, the police's
job is to serve the people.

1041
01:34:39,933 --> 01:34:41,091
Right.

1042
01:34:41,092 --> 01:34:43,677
- Munna. You want to play, don't you?
- Yes.

1043
01:34:43,678 --> 01:34:45,012
Don't mind.

1044
01:34:45,013 --> 01:34:48,348
Unload this revolver
and keep it inside.

1045
01:34:48,349 --> 01:34:50,522
And stand here quietly, get it.

1046
01:34:57,525 --> 01:34:58,775
Are you happy?

1047
01:34:58,776 --> 01:35:01,746
Son, start the game.

1048
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:03,497
Sir.

1049
01:35:03,948 --> 01:35:05,040
Sir.

1050
01:35:07,202 --> 01:35:09,955
Not you.. first I will catch him.

1051
01:35:11,581 --> 01:35:13,549
I am coming.

1052
01:35:17,712 --> 01:35:19,714
Caught you.

1053
01:35:20,048 --> 01:35:22,591
I caught him.

1054
01:35:22,592 --> 01:35:24,094
Out. Out.

1055
01:35:27,639 --> 01:35:29,437
Take off your shirt.

1056
01:35:30,433 --> 01:35:33,227
Take off your shirt.
Take off your shirt.

1057
01:35:33,228 --> 01:35:34,650
Do something, sir.

1058
01:35:35,563 --> 01:35:38,157
Take off your police belt.

1059
01:35:41,152 --> 01:35:42,904
Take it off. Take it off.

1060
01:35:43,112 --> 01:35:46,286
Take it off. Don't be shy.

1061
01:35:54,666 --> 01:35:56,760
Now the next..

1062
01:35:57,752 --> 01:36:01,052
The one with the mustache.

1063
01:37:15,038 --> 01:37:16,830
Son. Son.

1064
01:37:16,831 --> 01:37:19,880
What has happened?

1065
01:37:22,337 --> 01:37:23,964
Son. Son.

1066
01:37:24,547 --> 01:37:27,175
- Inspector.
- Yes, sir.

1067
01:37:27,842 --> 01:37:30,844
Prepare the report for
the dead body and write..

1068
01:37:30,845 --> 01:37:33,597
A madman jumped to his death.

1069
01:37:33,598 --> 01:37:37,309
And take the
minister's signature as witness.

1070
01:37:37,310 --> 01:37:41,355
And if required, then his father too.

1071
01:37:41,356 --> 01:37:42,608
Okay, sir.

1072
01:37:46,152 --> 01:37:50,658
Even the uniform of a honest
police officer does its duty, Baapji.

1073
01:37:54,285 --> 01:37:55,787
Remember that.

1074
01:38:26,692 --> 01:38:29,986
May God always keep you happy.

1075
01:38:29,987 --> 01:38:32,447
Left. Left. Right. Left.

1076
01:38:32,448 --> 01:38:33,990
Left. Left.

1077
01:38:33,991 --> 01:38:35,709
Turn back.

1078
01:38:37,495 --> 01:38:39,246
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

1079
01:38:39,247 --> 01:38:42,249
The people are happy not because
its 'Dussera' but because of you.

1080
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:43,877
What are you saying?

1081
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,708
We're actually celebrating
the death of Munna.

1082
01:38:46,796 --> 01:38:51,302
After Baapji and Titla are dead,
we'll celebrate every day.

1083
01:39:01,227 --> 01:39:02,853
Officer.

1084
01:39:02,854 --> 01:39:07,232
Officer, I feel Titla's
men are hiding in this crowd.

1085
01:39:07,233 --> 01:39:08,075
Be alert.

1086
01:39:08,076 --> 01:39:10,445
- Okay, sir.
- Spread our men everywhere. Quick.

1087
01:40:12,924 --> 01:40:15,800
Attacking from behind like a coward.

1088
01:40:15,801 --> 01:40:17,844
Face me like a man.

1089
01:40:17,845 --> 01:40:19,142
Come on.

1090
01:42:05,036 --> 01:42:07,412
'I've just one desire, sir.'

1091
01:42:07,413 --> 01:42:11,249
'When I face death, I
shouldn't look scared

1092
01:42:11,250 --> 01:42:16,928
'I should be brushing my mustache,
with a smile on my face.'

1093
01:42:44,659 --> 01:42:46,743
Vikram Rathore.

1094
01:42:46,744 --> 01:42:48,667
Great man.

1095
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:54,045
Coiffing your mustache and
said "I don't fear anyone".

1096
01:42:54,543 --> 01:42:56,795
Take a look at your God now.

1097
01:42:56,796 --> 01:42:59,675
He's hanging by the noose.

1098
01:43:00,299 --> 01:43:02,676
What kind of a God is he?

1099
01:43:02,677 --> 01:43:05,305
It took only one
bullet to bring him down.

1100
01:43:06,597 --> 01:43:09,974
You have just one God.

1101
01:43:09,975 --> 01:43:12,694
My brother Baapji.

1102
01:43:16,982 --> 01:43:21,158
The rascal was
laughing on my son's death.

1103
01:43:21,654 --> 01:43:23,907
Bury him in the ground.

1104
01:43:24,907 --> 01:43:27,660
And put up his photo on the grave.

1105
01:43:28,536 --> 01:43:32,622
So that everyone knows..

1106
01:43:32,623 --> 01:43:36,719
The consequences of
going against Baapji.

1107
01:44:06,741 --> 01:44:07,913
Sir.

1108
01:44:10,119 --> 01:44:11,587
Sir's alive.

1109
01:44:17,334 --> 01:44:19,086
Sir.

1110
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:26,917
I..

1111
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:30,750
We'll give our lives but we
won't tell anyone about this.

1112
01:44:31,390 --> 01:44:35,611
And after that we
hid him in a village..

1113
01:44:36,020 --> 01:44:38,318
And treated Vikram sir.

1114
01:44:38,856 --> 01:44:41,775
Then we brought him to Mumbai.
Multiple tests were conducted.

1115
01:44:41,776 --> 01:44:43,278
After which the doctor told us..

1116
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:47,833
That the injury to the brain
is severe due to the bullet.

1117
01:44:48,866 --> 01:44:50,868
He can die anytime.

1118
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:54,042
It was getting difficult
for us to handle Chinki.

1119
01:44:54,121 --> 01:44:57,045
She wouldn't even
eat without her father.

1120
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:01,254
That's when Jagdish saw you in the mall.

1121
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:05,167
And we were compelled to play this charade.

1122
01:45:05,716 --> 01:45:09,892
It's our problem, but you
had to face difficulties.

1123
01:45:10,346 --> 01:45:11,971
- We're really sorry.
- No. No..

1124
01:45:11,972 --> 01:45:13,681
Forget whatever happened.

1125
01:45:13,682 --> 01:45:14,891
Excuse me.

1126
01:45:14,892 --> 01:45:17,987
He has very little time.
Go and meet him immediately.

1127
01:45:37,957 --> 01:45:39,800
Where is Chinki?

1128
01:45:40,751 --> 01:45:44,506
Don't worry, sir.
Chinki's now my daughter.

1129
01:45:59,144 --> 01:46:00,361
Sir.

1130
01:46:11,448 --> 01:46:12,791
Papa.

1131
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:17,622
- Papa.
- Yes, dear.

1132
01:46:18,539 --> 01:46:19,961
What happened, Papa?

1133
01:46:21,166 --> 01:46:25,086
Nothing, dear. Uncle
here couldn't sleep.

1134
01:46:25,087 --> 01:46:27,636
So we were trying to tuck him in.

1135
01:46:37,099 --> 01:46:42,395
"Moon, hide behind the clouds."

1136
01:46:42,396 --> 01:46:47,618
"Moonlight, don't shine so bright."

1137
01:46:48,277 --> 01:46:52,157
Uncle will fall asleep
hearing mother's voice.

1138
01:46:53,449 --> 01:46:56,669
"Let my daughter sleep."

1139
01:46:58,829 --> 01:47:01,497
"Let sleep."

1140
01:47:01,498 --> 01:47:04,627
"Let my daughter sleep."

1141
01:47:05,711 --> 01:47:10,057
"She sleeps in my arms."

1142
01:47:11,050 --> 01:47:14,552
"And I'll sing all night for her."

1143
01:47:14,553 --> 01:47:18,723
'When I face death, I
shouldn't look scared

1144
01:47:18,724 --> 01:47:23,104
'I should be coffering my mustache,
with a smile on my face.'

1145
01:47:23,687 --> 01:47:28,158
'Even the uniform of a honest
police officer does its duty, Baapji.'

1146
01:47:44,458 --> 01:47:46,000
Hey, stop.

1147
01:47:46,001 --> 01:47:48,595
You're whistling without permission.

1148
01:47:48,963 --> 01:47:50,590
Shell out 500 Rs.

1149
01:47:52,549 --> 01:47:53,846
He's angry.

1150
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:57,917
I am not angry.

1151
01:48:00,641 --> 01:48:01,984
No.

1152
01:48:05,521 --> 01:48:06,818
Don't hit me.

1153
01:48:08,023 --> 01:48:09,366
It hurts.

1154
01:48:13,612 --> 01:48:16,161
If anyone touches me..

1155
01:48:18,617 --> 01:48:20,119
I will cry.

1156
01:48:22,496 --> 01:48:25,591
No one can stop me.

1157
01:48:28,043 --> 01:48:29,886
See, you're all scared.

1158
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:30,750
What?

1159
01:48:30,838 --> 01:48:32,306
Okay, I won't cry.

1160
01:48:33,632 --> 01:48:34,884
Brother's back.

1161
01:48:36,385 --> 01:48:39,229
He will again beat. Run. Run.

1162
01:48:39,888 --> 01:48:42,849
- First me.
- First me.

1163
01:48:42,850 --> 01:48:45,518
- Sir, me first. It hurts a lot.
- No, first me, sir.

1164
01:48:45,519 --> 01:48:47,897
No. Sir, if you start from there..

1165
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,542
I feel really restless until you come here.

1166
01:48:49,606 --> 01:48:51,566
Start from here.

1167
01:48:51,567 --> 01:48:54,527
I've an appointment
with your boss today.

1168
01:48:54,528 --> 01:48:57,372
- 2G.
- Yes.

1169
01:49:03,203 --> 01:49:04,876
70 from the old lady.

1170
01:49:05,706 --> 01:49:07,248
70 from Lalua.

1171
01:49:07,249 --> 01:49:09,500
Shell out the money,
what are you staring at?

1172
01:49:09,501 --> 01:49:11,252
Rascal.

1173
01:49:11,253 --> 01:49:13,421
You won't pay up. Of course you will.

1174
01:49:13,422 --> 01:49:16,596
So will your son. And your grandson.

1175
01:49:18,302 --> 01:49:21,932
No one can save you from Baapji.

1176
01:49:22,431 --> 01:49:23,765
Get some water.

1177
01:49:23,766 --> 01:49:24,938
Hurry up.

1178
01:49:25,559 --> 01:49:27,311
Brother-in-law, water.

1179
01:49:33,442 --> 01:49:34,534
I'm back.

1180
01:49:45,204 --> 01:49:46,046
Vikram Rathore..

1181
01:49:47,414 --> 01:49:49,832
- Take your share.
- No.

1182
01:49:49,833 --> 01:49:51,417
And don't ever come back here.

1183
01:49:51,418 --> 01:49:53,628
- What is going on?
- Only he knows that.

1184
01:49:53,629 --> 01:49:56,380
So, Baapji. Scared to see me.

1185
01:49:56,381 --> 01:49:59,175
- Or am I scaring you.
- Did you forget?

1186
01:49:59,176 --> 01:50:00,968
The last time my brother Titla..

1187
01:50:00,969 --> 01:50:04,013
Taught you a
lesson and made you flee.

1188
01:50:04,014 --> 01:50:06,724
When the lion takes two steps back..

1189
01:50:06,725 --> 01:50:08,434
He does so to pounce.

1190
01:50:08,435 --> 01:50:10,186
Not to flee, get that.

1191
01:50:10,187 --> 01:50:13,439
Just like I hung your son to death..

1192
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:17,527
Similarly I will kill
you and your brother..

1193
01:50:17,528 --> 01:50:20,238
And make the future
of this village better.

1194
01:50:20,239 --> 01:50:22,990
No one can lay a finger on me.

1195
01:50:22,991 --> 01:50:25,576
There's just one
rowdy in this village.

1196
01:50:25,577 --> 01:50:27,161
Exactly what I am saying.

1197
01:50:27,162 --> 01:50:30,414
There should be just one
rowdy in this village.

1198
01:50:30,415 --> 01:50:31,632
Me!

1199
01:50:32,042 --> 01:50:34,752
Rowdy.. Rathore.

1200
01:50:34,753 --> 01:50:35,845
Correct.

1201
01:50:37,798 --> 01:50:40,768
Tomorrow I will plunder your
grain storehouse at 12 o'clock.

1202
01:50:41,468 --> 01:50:43,594
And distribute it amongst the public.

1203
01:50:43,595 --> 01:50:45,643
Do you want to know how?

1204
01:50:46,265 --> 01:50:47,517
Look.

1205
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:56,458
"Chinta Ta Ta Chita Chita.
Chinta Ta Ta Ta Ta."

1206
01:50:56,525 --> 01:50:59,610
What's this?

1207
01:50:59,611 --> 01:51:01,864
It means 'Chinta' means stick..

1208
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:07,708
'Ta Ta' is your back...
and 'Chita Chita' pulp.

1209
01:51:07,786 --> 01:51:11,122
It means, I will give a
sound thrashing on your back..

1210
01:51:11,123 --> 01:51:13,046
And beat you to a pulp.

1211
01:51:14,877 --> 01:51:17,005
Don't angry me.

1212
01:51:17,880 --> 01:51:20,554
I always do.. what I say.

1213
01:51:21,675 --> 01:51:27,398
And yes. I definitely do..
What I don't say.

1214
01:51:34,188 --> 01:51:36,689
Brother-in-law. That hurt, didn't it?

1215
01:51:36,690 --> 01:51:37,690
Scoundrel.

1216
01:51:38,025 --> 01:51:40,949
Go ask your sister.

1217
01:51:47,576 --> 01:51:49,294
My girlfriend.

1218
01:51:51,038 --> 01:51:52,290
Just a minute.

1219
01:51:52,956 --> 01:51:56,460
Now, you're not Shiva,
but ASP Vikram Rathore.

1220
01:51:56,668 --> 01:51:57,965
Careful.

1221
01:52:02,507 --> 01:52:03,633
Shiva.

1222
01:52:07,471 --> 01:52:09,263
Where were you?

1223
01:52:09,264 --> 01:52:11,557
I missed you so much.

1224
01:52:11,558 --> 01:52:15,233
I forgot all your mistakes,
but I couldn't forget you.

1225
01:52:16,897 --> 01:52:18,439
I love you, Shiva.

1226
01:52:18,440 --> 01:52:19,737
Me?

1227
01:52:20,359 --> 01:52:22,318
Are you mocking me?

1228
01:52:22,319 --> 01:52:24,820
I am Vikram Rathore. Who are you?

1229
01:52:24,821 --> 01:52:27,907
- Shiva, you're asking me who I am.
- Yes.

1230
01:52:27,908 --> 01:52:31,661
Oh, Shiva, who looks just like me.

1231
01:52:31,662 --> 01:52:33,704
My daughter stayed
with him for a week.

1232
01:52:33,705 --> 01:52:37,750
You misunderstood him and..
Very bad. You lost a nice man.

1233
01:52:37,751 --> 01:52:39,094
Bad luck.

1234
01:52:39,461 --> 01:52:41,088
You missed him for a inch.

1235
01:52:45,217 --> 01:52:48,678
If you want to regret, then
do it on the side of the road.

1236
01:52:48,679 --> 01:52:49,479
Okay.

1237
01:52:50,055 --> 01:52:51,681
Inspector.

1238
01:52:51,682 --> 01:52:54,105
Drive the car. If she
doesn't move, then run her over.

1239
01:52:54,106 --> 01:52:55,353
Kill her.

1240
01:53:11,285 --> 01:53:14,537
Please Shiva. Stop this drama.

1241
01:53:14,538 --> 01:53:17,498
Look, madam. I can arrest you.

1242
01:53:17,499 --> 01:53:20,378
For troubling a police officer..

1243
01:53:30,971 --> 01:53:32,143
Where was I?

1244
01:53:33,181 --> 01:53:34,353
Here.

1245
01:53:35,142 --> 01:53:36,475
Yes.

1246
01:53:36,476 --> 01:53:38,069
I am Shiva. No.

1247
01:53:39,062 --> 01:53:41,861
I am Vikram Rathore and I don't know you.

1248
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:43,125
Please leave.

1249
01:53:47,321 --> 01:53:48,322
I will die.

1250
01:53:54,828 --> 01:53:56,162
Paro

1251
01:53:56,163 --> 01:53:58,757
Paro. Paro.

1252
01:54:00,751 --> 01:54:02,048
Paro. Paro.

1253
01:54:03,503 --> 01:54:04,550
Paro

1254
01:54:05,297 --> 01:54:06,389
Paro

1255
01:54:11,136 --> 01:54:13,389
I threw a stone.

1256
01:54:15,849 --> 01:54:18,768
If you don't love me, then why
did you jump in hearing the sound.

1257
01:54:18,769 --> 01:54:20,561
Stop this discussion.

1258
01:54:20,562 --> 01:54:23,156
Save me. I don't know how to swim.

1259
01:54:24,524 --> 01:54:26,150
Do you love me or not?

1260
01:54:26,151 --> 01:54:27,902
Only if I survive.

1261
01:54:27,903 --> 01:54:29,701
You're Shiva.

1262
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:32,374
Yes, I am.

1263
01:54:36,078 --> 01:54:38,454
Tell me, will you
take me for shopping..

1264
01:54:38,455 --> 01:54:40,298
Two times a week
after we get married?

1265
01:54:40,299 --> 01:54:42,500
You can shop for my
final rites after I die.

1266
01:54:42,501 --> 01:54:43,798
Save me, you..

1267
01:54:45,212 --> 01:54:46,338
Save me.

1268
01:54:47,422 --> 01:54:49,470
Don't jump on me.

1269
01:55:15,742 --> 01:55:20,919
"Your waistline stole my heart."

1270
01:55:25,168 --> 01:55:29,463
"Your waistline stole my heart."

1271
01:55:29,464 --> 01:55:33,514
"Your magic enchanted me strongly."

1272
01:55:36,930 --> 01:55:41,225
"Your waistline stole my heart."

1273
01:55:41,226 --> 01:55:45,106
"Your magic enchanted me strongly."

1274
01:55:46,898 --> 01:55:49,321
"I lost my heart."

1275
01:55:50,819 --> 01:55:55,072
"Darling, you've changed so much."

1276
01:55:55,073 --> 01:55:58,828
"Your magic enchanted me strongly."

1277
01:56:31,610 --> 01:56:35,571
"We'll look great together."

1278
01:56:35,572 --> 01:56:39,408
"Our love will become a saga."

1279
01:56:39,409 --> 01:56:43,370
"You'll have to bear my attitude."

1280
01:56:43,371 --> 01:56:47,458
"And forsake all your old habits."

1281
01:56:47,459 --> 01:56:51,086
"I know all the ways."

1282
01:56:51,087 --> 01:56:54,887
"How boys win hearts of girls."

1283
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:58,917
"You've stolen my slumber."

1284
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:02,875
"Made my heart beat faster."

1285
01:57:02,974 --> 01:57:04,975
"Your magic enchanted me strongly."

1286
01:57:04,976 --> 01:57:07,399
"I lost my heart."

1287
01:57:08,897 --> 01:57:13,150
"Darling, you've changed so much."

1288
01:57:13,151 --> 01:57:17,281
"Your magic enchanted me strongly."

1289
01:57:53,567 --> 01:57:57,570
"At first you acted so stubbornly."

1290
01:57:57,571 --> 01:58:01,532
"Listen to me, 0 Patna's damsel."

1291
01:58:01,533 --> 01:58:05,369
"I won you over so easily."

1292
01:58:05,370 --> 01:58:09,331
"And got through your attitude."

1293
01:58:09,332 --> 01:58:13,252
"The world calls your Rowdy."

1294
01:58:13,253 --> 01:58:17,131
"But I know that you con people."

1295
01:58:17,132 --> 01:58:20,056
"I know that you're an expert."

1296
01:58:21,052 --> 01:58:25,264
"Now I know what your intentions are."

1297
01:58:25,265 --> 01:58:27,142
"Your magic enchanted me strongly."

1298
01:58:27,143 --> 01:58:29,770
"I lost my heart."

1299
01:58:31,104 --> 01:58:35,316
"Darling, you've changed so much."

1300
01:58:35,317 --> 01:58:39,322
"Your magic enchanted me strongly."

1301
01:59:02,218 --> 01:59:04,846
2G had told me everything.

1302
01:59:05,930 --> 01:59:07,603
Don't worry.

1303
01:59:08,099 --> 01:59:11,560
Now, even I will look
after Chinki along with Shiva.

1304
01:59:11,561 --> 01:59:12,938
Thank you, madam.

1305
01:59:13,355 --> 01:59:14,607
Thank you very much.

1306
01:59:17,067 --> 01:59:18,567
- Shiva.
- Yes?

1307
01:59:18,568 --> 01:59:20,445
Hold me tightly this time.

1308
01:59:26,117 --> 01:59:28,285
He should've arrived
by now, but he hasn't.

1309
01:59:28,286 --> 01:59:30,663
I am waiting to see this scene.

1310
01:59:30,664 --> 01:59:32,790
What are you blabbering?

1311
01:59:32,791 --> 01:59:34,208
Nothing, brother-in-law.

1312
01:59:34,209 --> 01:59:37,461
I was just saying that the time's up..

1313
01:59:37,462 --> 01:59:39,088
And he hasn't arrived yet.

1314
01:59:39,089 --> 01:59:42,633
He never does what he says.

1315
01:59:42,634 --> 01:59:45,594
If he could, he wouldn't have said it.

1316
01:59:45,595 --> 01:59:47,188
That's right.

1317
01:59:48,640 --> 01:59:49,482
Hello.

1318
01:59:50,058 --> 01:59:51,355
Brother-in-law, it's for you.

1319
01:59:51,356 --> 01:59:52,976
Rathore.

1320
01:59:52,977 --> 01:59:55,355
What happened?

1321
01:59:55,897 --> 01:59:58,190
Are you so scared..

1322
01:59:58,191 --> 02:00:00,818
That you're calling me from a phone.

1323
02:00:00,819 --> 02:00:03,904
I am all ready at the storehouse..

1324
02:00:03,905 --> 02:00:07,741
To perform your final rites.

1325
02:00:07,742 --> 02:00:10,244
I was coming to your storehouse.

1326
02:00:10,245 --> 02:00:11,662
But what can I do?

1327
02:00:11,663 --> 02:00:15,165
I came across your
liquor factory on the way.

1328
02:00:15,166 --> 02:00:18,168
Now, I cannot distribute
liquor amongst the people.

1329
02:00:18,169 --> 02:00:21,296
So I thought I should
put an end to your factory.

1330
02:00:21,297 --> 02:00:23,220
Sol blew it up with a bomb.

1331
02:00:26,010 --> 02:00:29,890
I won't spare you.

1332
02:00:30,682 --> 02:00:32,349
Get the car.

1333
02:00:32,350 --> 02:00:34,523
Come on, come on.

1334
02:00:36,062 --> 02:00:39,356
He does first and says later.

1335
02:00:39,357 --> 02:00:41,780
Get in. Come on.

1336
02:00:46,239 --> 02:00:48,741
Come on. Charge! Come on.

1337
02:00:48,742 --> 02:00:49,994
Drive.

1338
02:00:57,584 --> 02:01:00,053
Take it. Take everything.

1339
02:01:09,262 --> 02:01:10,388
Brother-in-law.

1340
02:01:13,558 --> 02:01:16,232
- Rascal.
- It's for you.

1341
02:01:17,061 --> 02:01:20,314
What are you doing at the
burnt down liquor factory..

1342
02:01:20,315 --> 02:01:23,785
Leaving your storehouse
filled with grains unguarded?

1343
02:01:24,486 --> 02:01:26,236
Anyway, it's a good thing.

1344
02:01:26,237 --> 02:01:28,447
It saved your men from
getting beaten from me.

1345
02:01:28,448 --> 02:01:31,950
If you touch my grains
I will cut your hands.

1346
02:01:31,951 --> 02:01:34,620
The people are plundering your grains.

1347
02:01:34,621 --> 02:01:38,290
If you're a man.. they don't leave.

1348
02:01:38,291 --> 02:01:39,792
I am coming.

1349
02:01:39,793 --> 02:01:43,003
What did you just say,
brother-in-law? Now he'll wait for us.

1350
02:01:43,004 --> 02:01:45,052
Am I scared of that coward?

1351
02:02:10,323 --> 02:02:11,916
Greetings, Baapji.

1352
02:02:12,283 --> 02:02:14,001
Here, here.

1353
02:02:17,997 --> 02:02:20,250
Man.

1354
02:02:21,709 --> 02:02:27,506
Now tomorrow at 12 o'clock you
prove to me that you're a man.

1355
02:02:27,507 --> 02:02:29,007
What's going to
happen tomorrow, tell me?

1356
02:02:29,008 --> 02:02:30,383
What is going to happen tomorrow?

1357
02:02:30,384 --> 02:02:31,887
What's going to
happen tomorrow, tell me?

1358
02:02:31,888 --> 02:02:35,055
Tomorrow at 12 o'clock,
at the village square..

1359
02:02:35,056 --> 02:02:38,517
Your brother-in-law is
going to learn his lesson.

1360
02:02:38,518 --> 02:02:42,396
I've made a program of getting your
brother-in-law beaten by the public.

1361
02:02:42,397 --> 02:02:43,569
I see.

1362
02:02:44,482 --> 02:02:48,908
How will you escape
alive from here, fool?

1363
02:02:54,117 --> 02:02:55,414
I'll show you.

1364
02:02:55,869 --> 02:02:56,995
Oh, God.

1365
02:03:01,833 --> 02:03:05,303
What are you all staring at? Keep
hitting him as long as he's alive.

1366
02:03:18,892 --> 02:03:20,601
Fools.

1367
02:03:20,602 --> 02:03:23,854
I ran, jumped, ducked.

1368
02:03:23,855 --> 02:03:25,823
Surely, I must have made a plan.

1369
02:03:26,065 --> 02:03:29,945
You are all a bunch of fools.

1370
02:03:50,048 --> 02:03:52,972
Today was just the trailer.

1371
02:03:53,885 --> 02:03:57,606
Tomorrow, I'll show
you the real picture.

1372
02:04:05,647 --> 02:04:07,775
Listen.

1373
02:04:08,858 --> 02:04:13,111
When you're angry, you scream.

1374
02:04:13,112 --> 02:04:15,331
I blow things.

1375
02:04:15,615 --> 02:04:17,242
Boom.

1376
02:04:55,571 --> 02:04:57,698
Wow, Rathore.

1377
02:04:57,699 --> 02:05:00,534
That's some film you're showing me.

1378
02:05:00,535 --> 02:05:02,458
That's a good crowd you've gathered.

1379
02:05:02,459 --> 02:05:05,914
You should be
campaigning for the elections.

1380
02:05:05,915 --> 02:05:08,792
You've gathered a crowd.

1381
02:05:08,793 --> 02:05:11,763
But how will you give them courage.

1382
02:05:12,672 --> 02:05:15,507
They are my slaves.

1383
02:05:15,508 --> 02:05:20,355
That's not blood that runs
in their veins, but water.

1384
02:05:21,764 --> 02:05:25,610
Isn't your blood
boiling hearing all this?

1385
02:05:26,519 --> 02:05:29,938
And if each one of you hit him once..

1386
02:05:29,939 --> 02:05:32,783
Can Baapji and his men survive?

1387
02:05:33,693 --> 02:05:35,694
Why are you all standing
there with heads bowed?

1388
02:05:35,695 --> 02:05:37,868
Come forward. Beat him!

1389
02:05:39,615 --> 02:05:42,117
When they can't raise their eyes..

1390
02:05:42,118 --> 02:05:44,166
How can they raise
their hands on me.

1391
02:05:44,996 --> 02:05:51,126
Not just men, but if I
point my finger at any woman..

1392
02:05:51,127 --> 02:05:54,722
She'll come and sit on my thighs.

1393
02:05:57,967 --> 02:05:59,594
Do you want to see?

1394
02:06:09,854 --> 02:06:10,946
You!

1395
02:06:12,732 --> 02:06:14,232
Yes, you.

1396
02:06:14,233 --> 02:06:15,405
Come here.

1397
02:06:24,869 --> 02:06:28,043
She's that police officer's wife.

1398
02:06:29,332 --> 02:06:33,963
I can't tolerate you four times a day.

1399
02:06:35,546 --> 02:06:38,174
But once a week..

1400
02:06:39,425 --> 02:06:40,597
Come on.

1401
02:06:43,471 --> 02:06:44,688
Come on.

1402
02:06:45,098 --> 02:06:46,725
Sit on my thigh.

1403
02:06:50,103 --> 02:06:51,400
Come.

1404
02:06:54,273 --> 02:06:55,525
Come on.

1405
02:07:02,532 --> 02:07:04,330
Bravo, Pramila!

1406
02:07:07,203 --> 02:07:09,422
You'll make me sit on my thigh!

1407
02:07:11,749 --> 02:07:13,667
I will gut you.

1408
02:07:13,668 --> 02:07:16,378
If that day I had
mustered some courage..

1409
02:07:16,379 --> 02:07:19,974
Then your son
would've died by my hands.

1410
02:07:20,842 --> 02:07:23,593
You haven't seen a woman's rage.

1411
02:07:23,594 --> 02:07:26,513
Take a look! Take a look!

1412
02:07:26,514 --> 02:07:28,016
Charge!

1413
02:07:29,016 --> 02:07:30,892
Beat the scoundrels.

1414
02:07:30,893 --> 02:07:32,644
I won't spare you.

1415
02:07:32,645 --> 02:07:34,062
Run, Sarju.

1416
02:07:34,063 --> 02:07:35,608
- I won't spare you.
- Enough, sister.

1417
02:07:35,609 --> 02:07:37,654
I won't leave you. - Now the
police will take care of him.

1418
02:07:37,655 --> 02:07:39,527
Come on, get up.

1419
02:07:42,864 --> 02:07:44,411
Beat him.

1420
02:07:44,866 --> 02:07:46,789
Don't spare him.

1421
02:07:47,952 --> 02:07:49,369
Stop this.

1422
02:07:49,370 --> 02:07:51,454
What's going on? Are you inhumane?

1423
02:07:51,455 --> 02:07:53,503
Is this how you beat a decent man?

1424
02:07:56,210 --> 02:07:58,420
- What is this?
- Sticks, sir.

1425
02:07:58,421 --> 02:08:00,422
Only five are left. I had brought 100.

1426
02:08:00,423 --> 02:08:02,799
Are you a police
officer or a cruel man?

1427
02:08:02,800 --> 02:08:05,349
Is this how you'll
beat a man behind my back?

1428
02:08:05,720 --> 02:08:07,438
- Sorry, sir. I made a mistake.
- Yes.

1429
02:08:12,018 --> 02:08:13,017
Didn't you hear?

1430
02:08:13,018 --> 02:08:14,987
He said don't hit them behind his
back, hit them when his watching.

1431
02:08:14,988 --> 02:08:16,196
Start again.

1432
02:08:16,981 --> 02:08:18,233
Don't mind.

1433
02:08:21,611 --> 02:08:23,320
Hey, minister. Get lost from here.

1434
02:08:23,321 --> 02:08:25,540
You want to get us beaten up.

1435
02:08:27,074 --> 02:08:29,993
Fine, I am going. Goodbye.

1436
02:08:29,994 --> 02:08:32,287
Where are you going? The
program has just begun.

1437
02:08:32,288 --> 02:08:33,872
It's your turn next.

1438
02:08:33,873 --> 02:08:35,999
I've a meeting with the CM.

1439
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:37,877
- Forget the meeting.
- No, no, let me go.

1440
02:08:37,878 --> 02:08:40,096
To hell with the CM. Let me go.

1441
02:08:41,672 --> 02:08:44,090
Why did you stop? Is today a Sunday?

1442
02:08:44,091 --> 02:08:46,514
Come on, start.

1443
02:09:18,084 --> 02:09:20,257
Abduct everyone.

1444
02:09:38,771 --> 02:09:40,480
Don't be scared, Chinki.

1445
02:09:40,481 --> 02:09:43,066
I'll tell you a story.

1446
02:09:43,067 --> 02:09:46,321
There was once a dacoit in the jungle.

1447
02:09:46,612 --> 02:09:48,865
He was very dangerous.

1448
02:09:51,033 --> 02:09:52,205
Like him.

1449
02:09:53,995 --> 02:09:56,496
One day a police officer along.

1450
02:09:56,497 --> 02:09:58,499
He was very brave.

1451
02:09:58,666 --> 02:10:00,885
Just like your father.

1452
02:10:01,252 --> 02:10:08,227
He.. beat that dacoit to a pulp.

1453
02:10:15,099 --> 02:10:16,692
Come on. Hit her.

1454
02:10:18,060 --> 02:10:20,438
Shut up.

1455
02:10:21,355 --> 02:10:23,106
Just you watch.

1456
02:10:23,107 --> 02:10:26,818
If Vikram Rathore comes here..

1457
02:10:26,819 --> 02:10:31,165
Then we'll hunt him down like a pig.

1458
02:10:33,451 --> 02:10:35,035
Fool.

1459
02:10:35,036 --> 02:10:37,334
Vikram Rathore is dead.

1460
02:10:38,039 --> 02:10:39,247
What?

1461
02:10:39,248 --> 02:10:42,377
The one who's coming today is Shiva.

1462
02:10:43,252 --> 02:10:45,380
He's Rowdy.

1463
02:10:52,887 --> 02:10:55,857
Listen you rascal.

1464
02:10:57,016 --> 02:11:00,560
You deceitfully killed Vikram Rathore.

1465
02:11:00,561 --> 02:11:03,688
But my Shiva, he's a deceiver himself.

1466
02:11:03,689 --> 02:11:06,483
He's such a scoundrel..

1467
02:11:06,484 --> 02:11:09,235
That he always does what he says.

1468
02:11:09,236 --> 02:11:13,582
And he definitely does
what he doesn't say.

1469
02:11:14,950 --> 02:11:18,955
Listen to me and run for your life.

1470
02:11:20,164 --> 02:11:22,462
Or else.

1471
02:11:30,091 --> 02:11:34,016
"Chinta Ta Ta Chita Chita.
Chinta Ta Ta Ta Ta."

1472
02:11:37,264 --> 02:11:39,432
What is that?

1473
02:11:39,433 --> 02:11:41,393
It means 'Chinta' means stick..

1474
02:11:41,394 --> 02:11:45,230
'Ta Ta' is your back..
And 'Chita Chita' pulp.

1475
02:11:45,231 --> 02:11:49,567
She's saying, he'll will give a
sound thrashing on your back..

1476
02:11:49,568 --> 02:11:50,990
And beat you to a pulp.

1477
02:11:50,991 --> 02:11:54,364
Brother-in-law asked before
you and they beat him to a pulp.

1478
02:11:54,365 --> 02:11:57,335
And now you're asking. $0..

1479
02:11:59,995 --> 02:12:03,499
What are you looking at?
Kill his daughter.

1480
02:12:13,217 --> 02:12:14,514
Papa.

1481
02:12:16,095 --> 02:12:18,972
Forget about touching my daughter..

1482
02:12:18,973 --> 02:12:23,979
If anyone even thinks
about it, then I will kill him.

1483
02:12:26,689 --> 02:12:27,906
Beat him.

1484
02:13:39,428 --> 02:13:41,726
- Stop. Stop.
- Shiva.

1485
02:13:58,864 --> 02:14:00,081
Go.

1486
02:15:58,609 --> 02:16:01,027
Man of steel.

1487
02:16:01,028 --> 02:16:04,077
Get up.

1488
02:16:09,703 --> 02:16:11,000
Come on.

1489
02:16:35,312 --> 02:16:37,406
Don't angry me.

1490
02:16:39,274 --> 02:16:40,526
Rascal.

1491
02:18:31,762 --> 02:18:34,436
You were right.

1492
02:18:35,015 --> 02:18:36,557
Your Shiva..

1493
02:18:36,558 --> 02:18:42,315
Beat me to a pulp.

1494
02:18:45,609 --> 02:18:48,613
But shall I show you what I do?

1495
02:19:18,016 --> 02:19:20,643
No, no, no.

1496
02:19:20,644 --> 02:19:22,237
No.

1497
02:19:23,397 --> 02:19:24,774
No.

1498
02:20:16,450 --> 02:20:18,743
- I always warned him.
- Sir.

1499
02:20:18,744 --> 02:20:20,578
Sir, please thrash us.

1500
02:20:20,579 --> 02:20:22,330
We wait for you every day.

1501
02:20:22,331 --> 02:20:23,799
I am not in the mood right now.

1502
02:20:23,800 --> 02:20:28,261
No, sir. Beat us just a little.

1503
02:20:32,841 --> 02:20:35,014
Man of steel. Let's go.

1504
02:20:45,896 --> 02:20:49,690
I always do.. what I say.

1505
02:20:49,691 --> 02:20:53,321
I definitely do.. what I don't say.
