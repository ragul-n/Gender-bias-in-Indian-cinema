2
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:40,666
Good morning, Raj.

3
00:03:40,667 --> 00:03:44,540
Get up, son. It is morning.

4
00:03:44,541 --> 00:03:49,041
Good morning, papa.
- Good morning, son.

5
00:03:49,042 --> 00:03:52,333
Hey, get up. You've to go to
school. - Has he not got up till yet?

6
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:53,999
Hey, Raj, get up. See,
grandma has come now.

7
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,166
The father doesn't have a night...

8
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:56,749
...and the son doesn't
have a morning.

9
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,582
Come on, have your milk.
And you tell me...

10
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,374
You have been sleeping
half and incomplete...

11
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,707
...since so many months, how many
more nights will you stay awake?

12
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,916
Mother, last night was the last
time that I would stay awake.

13
00:04:05,917 --> 00:04:08,749
The project on which I
was working is over.

14
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:13,750
Come, I will show you. Come on, son.

15
00:04:17,917 --> 00:04:21,415
Papa, you have made a wonderful car.

16
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:22,916
Did you like it, mother?

17
00:04:22,917 --> 00:04:26,291
It is very good son. But you have
worked on it too, isn't it?

18
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,415
Some companies have offered me.

19
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:31,625
After applying for the patent, I
have to hold meetings with them.

20
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:44,458
I am Mr. Rakesh Kapoor.
- Hi. - And these are my partners.

21
00:04:57,708 --> 00:05:02,375
Please come.

22
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:18,833
This is an eight-cylinder V-engine.

23
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,415
And all this technology
is controlled...

24
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:33,415
...by computer diagnosis systems.

25
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:39,125
If the car meets with
an accident, that is.

26
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,415
In making this car, I have paid...

27
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:51,999
...most of my attention
to the high seating...

28
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,292
...and excellent road
hold to the driver.

29
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:03,374
You have made such
a beautiful design.

30
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,791
We like your project a lot.

31
00:06:05,792 --> 00:06:07,958
Tell me. What kind of deal
would you wish to make?

32
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:09,916
I want twenty percent
of the royalty.

33
00:06:09,917 --> 00:06:14,374
The car's logo will be of my name.

34
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,541
We are very impressed
by your design.

35
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:20,374
But... But we can't understand
these terms of yours.

36
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:23,374
Sir, my terms are because of
the beauties of my project.

37
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:26,374
My car is a futuristic car.

38
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,374
And as you people must have seen...

39
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:29,874
...there isn't any car
made like this...

40
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,916
...which has so many features in it.

41
00:06:31,917 --> 00:06:33,541
And having such good
fuel efficiency too.

42
00:06:33,542 --> 00:06:35,999
We agree that you have made
a excellent car model.

43
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,749
But we have to keep our company...

44
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,833
...name's value in the market.

45
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:42,582
Therefore, we cannot give your name.

46
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:45,708
But we will pay whatever you
wish for this project.

47
00:06:45,917 --> 00:06:49,042
But we cannot give you
royalty or partnership.

48
00:06:51,667 --> 00:06:57,125
I do not agree to your deal.

49
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:06,791
Give him back his disc.

50
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:14,041
You have made a very
advanced machine.

51
00:07:14,042 --> 00:07:16,374
I don't think that such
a machine can be made...

52
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,791
...in the automobile industry
in the next ten years.

53
00:07:18,792 --> 00:07:21,374
We accept all your conditions.

54
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:24,374
We will give you a royalty, and
give the car your name too.

55
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,916
I have a discussion with my
technical team tomorrow.

56
00:07:26,917 --> 00:07:28,874
After that, the next week...

57
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:34,083
We will sign the agreement.

58
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:39,417
Mother...

59
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,499
Hey, have you come?

60
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,875
My project deal is finalized. I am
signing the contract next week.

61
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:51,459
I knew it. True hard work
is never a waste.

62
00:07:54,417 --> 00:07:57,542
Even I have made a car.
- Is it?

63
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,833
You will become a greater
engineer than me.

64
00:08:02,834 --> 00:08:05,833
This can't be possible.
- Why?

65
00:08:05,834 --> 00:08:09,332
Because I can't keep awake
at nights like you.

66
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:14,042
Donkey!

67
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,708
Papa, why do you wash it everyday?

68
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:26,708
I make you bathe everyday too,
isn't it? - But why?

69
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:28,541
The thing that we love...

70
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:30,874
...shouldn't we keep
his lovely always?

71
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:33,916
Do you love this car very much?
- Yes.

72
00:08:33,917 --> 00:08:36,374
Why? Papa?

73
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:39,792
Son, this is my father's symbol.
He had gifted it to me.

74
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:46,500
I will gift it to you
when you grow up.

75
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,582
Papa, why have you put this Tarzan?

76
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,499
I had kept it here in my childhood.

77
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,457
I believed this car
to be Tarzan and...

78
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,416
...I had even named it as Tarzan.

79
00:08:57,417 --> 00:08:58,958
Tarzan was a man.

80
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,292
Yes, he was a man. But was
strong like this machine.

81
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,999
But papa, Tarzan used
to eat food too.

82
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,666
Where does this car eat food?

83
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:09,916
Doesn't it?

84
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:13,332
Then why doesn't it wear clothes?

85
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,666
Even Tarzan didn't wear any clothes.

86
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:17,332
Just because the censor shouldn't...

87
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,916
...object, the movie
and cartoon Tarzan...

88
00:09:18,917 --> 00:09:20,957
...were made to wear a knickers
made of leaves. - But.

89
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:23,624
Now don't ask me what a censor is.

90
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:29,791
It is your phone, son.
- I am coming, mother.

91
00:09:29,792 --> 00:09:31,874
I am Mukund Joshi speaking
from Harsh Motors.

92
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:34,374
Yes, Mr. Joshi...

93
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:38,417
Our company doesn't wish
to deal with you. - Why?

94
00:09:38,542 --> 00:09:40,582
The design which you say is yours...

95
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:42,708
...and using which you wish
to deal with the company...

96
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:46,417
...Four Fox company has patented
it three months ago.

97
00:09:48,834 --> 00:09:50,915
But... I have completed
the design four...

98
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,749
...days ago and patented
it. Then how...

99
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,457
...come Four Fox patent
it three months ago?

100
00:09:54,458 --> 00:10:00,084
We don't know that. You ask them.

101
00:10:03,417 --> 00:10:05,833
I have an idea.
- What?

102
00:10:05,834 --> 00:10:07,915
We won't make this car ourselves.

103
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:09,915
Instead, we will give
this car's design...

104
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:11,416
...to some German or Japanese...

105
00:10:11,417 --> 00:10:14,666
...company and eat it's royalty
throughout life. - Yes!

106
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:18,792
We cannot give royalty, but we can
take it, isn't it? - Surely.

107
00:10:19,417 --> 00:10:22,958
A stolen thing shouldn't be
dangled by the neck as it is.

108
00:10:23,417 --> 00:10:26,458
Because the one who owns the
thing will strangle you.

109
00:10:27,417 --> 00:10:29,583
You patented my design in your...

110
00:10:29,584 --> 00:10:32,709
...name by bribing the
patent registrar.

111
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,874
We did that, all right.

112
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:38,416
And you cannot harm
us in anyway now.

113
00:10:38,417 --> 00:10:41,416
I have the receipt of
the patent application.

114
00:10:41,417 --> 00:10:43,583
I will take you four foxes and the...

115
00:10:43,584 --> 00:10:46,416
...patent registrar to the court.

116
00:10:46,417 --> 00:10:50,333
I still have so much proof that
I can have you four arrested.

117
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:57,209
I will go to the police station
right away and expose you.

118
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:06,915
I have got the information.
They are not in the office.

119
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,666
They have gone to the farmhouse.

120
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:11,416
Have you brought your
proofs with you?

121
00:11:11,417 --> 00:11:12,957
The CD of my designs and the...

122
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:15,832
...receipt of the patent
application is with me.

123
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:18,958
We will go to their farmhouse
right away. - Come on.

124
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:33,416
But listen to me carefully. The
agreement that we signed...

125
00:11:33,417 --> 00:11:35,708
He has registered a complaint.

126
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:38,416
You people have stolen
the designs of his car.

127
00:11:38,417 --> 00:11:41,499
And at this time, he has
the proof with him too.

128
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,416
He had come to us to sell his car.

129
00:11:44,417 --> 00:11:47,709
We didn't complete the deal
so we copied his CD.

130
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,749
We also knew that if he
goes to the court...

131
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,583
...we will have to fight
the case for many years.

132
00:11:53,584 --> 00:11:55,874
And we won't have anything
in our hands.

133
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:58,416
You are right.

134
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:00,749
Please give them all the proof.

135
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:04,416
The problem will be solved.

136
00:12:04,417 --> 00:12:06,832
Hey, there isn't any
need to be shocked.

137
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:09,666
We own that inspector.

138
00:12:09,667 --> 00:12:13,416
It was your bad luck
that you went to him.

139
00:12:13,417 --> 00:12:16,625
And we know that you wouldn't
give us the proof.

140
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,082
Therefore, he will kill you now.

141
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:24,291
And he will close your file too.

142
00:12:24,417 --> 00:12:27,832
I had heard that every
dog has it's day.

143
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:32,416
But I hadn't heard any
phrase for foxes.

144
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:35,459
You committed a huge mistake
my calling me here.

145
00:12:36,417 --> 00:12:38,583
I am an automobile engineer.

146
00:12:38,584 --> 00:12:43,625
I can ruin the design
as well as make it!

147
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:43,458
He broke my leg! That dog!

148
00:13:51,417 --> 00:13:53,915
I will call the police
and press now.

149
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:57,500
I will strip your uniform with
the skin of these four people.

150
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:16,166
What do you think? Are there
saints and seers in business?

151
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:23,665
You will ruin the design? Take this!

152
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:27,416
You call us foxes?

153
00:14:27,417 --> 00:14:28,749
Please stop.

154
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,499
Don't kill him here.

155
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,583
We will put him in his car and
put him in the lake behind.

156
00:14:33,584 --> 00:14:36,625
It will never be found out whether
it was an accident or a murder.

157
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:42,542
The inspector is right.
- Okay.

158
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:20,417
We will give you name and royalty
both in your rebirth.

159
00:15:48,417 --> 00:15:50,416
Go. Go and design a flying machine...

160
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:55,959
...for the God of Death, Go!

161
00:16:31,417 --> 00:16:35,833
Hey, battery! Don't you see
even after wearing glasses?

162
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,916
That place is not for
parking your cycle.

163
00:16:37,917 --> 00:16:39,582
It is for parking our bikes.

164
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:40,790
So where should I park?

165
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,916
Hey, do you think that we
are parking instructors?

166
00:16:42,917 --> 00:16:47,959
Come on, park it anywhere.

167
00:16:50,417 --> 00:16:55,916
Hey, battery. Come here. Come here.

168
00:16:55,917 --> 00:16:59,541
See, battery. You passed
and came into our class.

169
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:00,916
What does that mean?

170
00:17:00,917 --> 00:17:03,832
This means that you
failed this time too?

171
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:06,624
Are you very happy?
- No. I am sorry.

172
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,708
You are expressing your sorrow with
such happiness. - Come here.

173
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,790
Come here.

174
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:16,750
Okay, tell me. How is two and two?
- Yes?

175
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,749
What are you stammering for?
Tell me how much they are?

176
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,957
Two and two are four.

177
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:24,374
You fool. Two and two
are twenty-two, what?

178
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:27,457
Tell me, how much is it?

179
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:29,624
Twenty-two.

180
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:32,832
Now he has come in our category.

181
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:35,540
What is going on?
- Oh God! Double battery!

182
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:38,416
What are you doing here?
- Nothing sir.

183
00:17:38,417 --> 00:17:40,832
Everyone calls this
poor kid as battery.

184
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:43,582
We were just asking
him his real name.

185
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:47,958
No sir. No body else, they
call me battery. - Why?

186
00:17:48,417 --> 00:17:50,416
Because I wear spectacles, isn't it?

187
00:17:50,417 --> 00:17:52,916
This means that you must be calling
me a battery too? - No sir.

188
00:17:52,917 --> 00:17:55,499
These people call you
a double battery. - What!

189
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,708
I will rusticate you people,
what do you think?

190
00:17:58,792 --> 00:18:00,665
You will sit here all
through your life?

191
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:02,916
You will ruin his life too?
I won't let this happen!

192
00:18:02,917 --> 00:18:04,333
Battery, go from here!

193
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:05,791
Raj, you go.

194
00:18:05,792 --> 00:18:08,333
You call me a double battery? Yes?

195
00:18:08,334 --> 00:18:11,750
Raj, why are you late?
- I met those four headaches.

196
00:18:12,334 --> 00:18:14,374
It seems that those
four heachaches...

197
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,457
...think you to be a Baburao.
- Baburao?

198
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:17,749
What is this now?

199
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,415
I haven't been able to tackle
battery till now...

200
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,457
...and you are giving
me another surname?

201
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:28,292
Did you bring my books?
- I have brought them. Take these.

202
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:08,749
It is such an item!

203
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:14,250
What a figure!

204
00:19:18,334 --> 00:19:23,792
It seems she is coming towards us.

205
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:30,707
Can you tell me where the
principal's office is?

206
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:34,457
In which college were
you before this?

207
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:37,374
By the way, I asked about
the principal's office.

208
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:41,250
Go straight and inside. There
will be stairs there.

209
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,374
Go upstairs and left.
There will be...

210
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:48,750
...the principal's office
a little farther.

211
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,666
Please go!

212
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:19,415
I will come in too!

213
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:23,958
She is angry.

214
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:29,333
See. These are not good boys.
I will show you the...

215
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:32,083
...principal's office.
I am not like those.

216
00:20:32,084 --> 00:20:35,707
Please come.

217
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:40,167
Move!

218
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:47,833
This is our principal.

219
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:59,916
Hey, Raj, what are you doing?

220
00:20:59,917 --> 00:21:02,916
Look at this design. This
car will become like this.

221
00:21:02,917 --> 00:21:04,832
This car will become like this?

222
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,916
Wow! You have made such a design.

223
00:21:06,917 --> 00:21:08,832
It's good.

224
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:11,749
Yes. Sir is calling you.
Go and get you salary.

225
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,499
Fifteen... sixteen... seventeen...
eighteen...

226
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,792
This is your salary. - Yes. -

227
00:21:17,917 --> 00:21:19,041
Sign here.

228
00:21:19,042 --> 00:21:24,666
Papa, should I lift it?
- No. Manglu, lift the phone. - Yes.

229
00:21:24,667 --> 00:21:26,083
Yes?
- This is your salary.

230
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:30,415
I have cut the money for
three days. - Why?

231
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:33,415
You were absent for three
weeks last month.

232
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:34,582
Don't you remember?

233
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:37,499
Yes... But I had to go
out with grandma.

234
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,999
You tell me something.

235
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,707
Are you paid for my service
or grandma's service?

236
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:46,667
Why are you staring at me
now? Go away. - Okay.

237
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:51,582
Yes, papa?

238
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:53,415
I had kept the curd milk in
the jug with ice to cool off.

239
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:54,749
Where has it gone?

240
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,415
There was a client here.
His car was hot.

241
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,415
I put it in his radiator
for coolness.

242
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:01,541
You put my curd milk
in his radiator?

243
00:22:01,542 --> 00:22:02,874
There was nothing more cold.

244
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:04,041
So you should have
put my head in it.

245
00:22:04,042 --> 00:22:05,749
I would have done that.
But your head is hot!

246
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,749
What if the radiator caught fire?

247
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,999
Explain this son of
a fool something!

248
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,291
Otherwise he will stay like a
used the outside the garage.

249
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:19,000
The fool!

250
00:22:28,667 --> 00:22:33,375
Grandma!

251
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,415
Tell me. How was your
first day in college?

252
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:37,999
Grandma, is the first
day of college...

253
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,749
...and the last day of
school every good?

254
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:42,415
Yes, but seventy five percent
of my day was very good.

255
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:45,415
Why was the rest twenty
five percent bad?

256
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:51,208
Some of my seniors asked some
stupid questions to me.

257
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:54,833
Grandma, can I ask you something?

258
00:22:54,834 --> 00:22:57,749
How do I look like?

259
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:00,041
I mean... do I look good?

260
00:23:00,042 --> 00:23:02,707
Son, you are one in a million.

261
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:04,374
Please don't joke, grandma.

262
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:07,374
Think that you weren't
seventy but eighteen.

263
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:09,958
How would I look then?

264
00:23:09,959 --> 00:23:13,416
Why are you talking about beauty
and complexion today?

265
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:16,749
Did you see some girl in college?
- How did you know that?

266
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,749
The boys of today are very smart.

267
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,415
They know that the girls of today...

268
00:23:20,416 --> 00:23:22,833
...don't see their future
but their feature.

269
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:24,415
Who is that girl?

270
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,749
A girl has taken admission
in our college from London.

271
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,749
Quite some boys are waiting
to be friends with her.

272
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,582
Some of them troubled her
too. But I helped her.

273
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:33,415
I sent her to the
principal's office.

274
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:37,625
I understood what was seventy
percent nice in this day.

275
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,666
You like this girl, isn't it?

276
00:23:39,667 --> 00:23:41,582
No, it's isn't like that.

277
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:44,707
See, I am not your mother,
I am your grandma.

278
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:48,291
And if I was eighteen year
old I would wish you...

279
00:23:48,417 --> 00:23:54,000
...you to approach me and talk to me.

280
00:24:38,417 --> 00:24:43,958
What are you staring at?

281
00:24:46,417 --> 00:24:47,582
For what?

282
00:24:47,583 --> 00:24:48,958
You left me to the principal's
office yesterday.

283
00:24:48,959 --> 00:24:54,125
And I didn't even thank you.

284
00:24:57,417 --> 00:24:59,582
Okay, I have to prepare some notes.

285
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:04,917
Even I have to prepare some notes.

286
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:11,083
Look at that.

287
00:25:23,375 --> 00:25:26,792
How fortunate the library is...!

288
00:25:26,917 --> 00:25:30,417
No, that rubber of the pencil.

289
00:25:32,417 --> 00:25:36,416
If only, I would be that rubber.

290
00:25:36,417 --> 00:25:40,458
All of you wait here and
see what Rocky does.

291
00:25:45,417 --> 00:25:48,416
I have been searching you to
say sorry since yesterday.

292
00:25:48,417 --> 00:25:51,416
The path to the principal's
office that I showed you...

293
00:25:51,417 --> 00:25:52,957
...I told you right turn instead
of left turn by mistake...

294
00:25:52,958 --> 00:25:55,666
...and you reached the gent's toilet.

295
00:25:55,667 --> 00:25:59,000
As it is, some mischief is
tolerated in friendship, isn't it?

296
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:03,040
If you do any mischief
with me the next time...

297
00:26:03,041 --> 00:26:04,708
...I won't complain
to the principal...

298
00:26:04,709 --> 00:26:09,375
...but to the commissioner directly.

299
00:26:19,458 --> 00:26:21,915
Even a professor must not have
scolded Rocky like this.

300
00:26:21,916 --> 00:26:24,541
But you seemed more
scared than Rocky.

301
00:26:24,542 --> 00:26:26,541
No, why will I be scared?
- Okay listen.

302
00:26:26,542 --> 00:26:28,374
Our college came is going next week.

303
00:26:28,375 --> 00:26:30,416
I have put your name in it too.
And you too are coming.

304
00:26:30,417 --> 00:26:32,416
No friend. I can't come.
- Why?

305
00:26:32,417 --> 00:26:34,541
There is a lot of work in the
garage. And uncle will shout!

306
00:26:34,542 --> 00:26:36,833
Hey, your uncle always shouts.

307
00:26:36,834 --> 00:26:40,292
Let him shout. My household
works because of him.

308
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:46,209
Okay, friend.

309
00:26:53,834 --> 00:26:58,458
Your purse...

310
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,832
You here?

311
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:49,416
Your purse, it had fallen
down in the college.

312
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:52,416
But you could give this purse
to me tomorrow too. - I could.

313
00:27:52,417 --> 00:27:54,749
But this purse had some your keys,
money and credit cards.

314
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,749
And it even had your
driving license.

315
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,791
I thought whether you would
be worried the whole night.

316
00:27:58,792 --> 00:28:01,499
You took such a huge
risk for my worry?

317
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,332
What would something
have happened to you?

318
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:05,915
You have come to my house
for the first time.

319
00:28:05,916 --> 00:28:09,874
You will have to drink tea.

320
00:28:09,875 --> 00:28:11,749
What happened?
- Sometime else.

321
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:14,541
That means I will have to drop the
purse again, isn't it? - No!

322
00:28:14,542 --> 00:28:19,209
I will surely come.

323
00:28:24,375 --> 00:28:26,374
Are you hurt?
- No!

324
00:28:26,375 --> 00:28:32,250
I will come to have some tea.
- Surely.

325
00:29:38,459 --> 00:29:40,957
Why have you put this Tarzan?

326
00:29:40,958 --> 00:29:42,708
I had put it in my childhood.

327
00:29:42,709 --> 00:29:44,541
I thought that this car was Tarzan...

328
00:29:44,542 --> 00:29:46,374
...and I had named it Tarzan too.

329
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:48,374
Tarzan was a man.

330
00:29:48,375 --> 00:29:51,791
Yes, he was a man. But he had
a power like this machine.

331
00:30:08,667 --> 00:30:09,790
Hey, boy!

332
00:30:09,791 --> 00:30:14,541
What are you doing here?
What do you want?

333
00:30:14,542 --> 00:30:16,790
Uncle, where did you
get this car from?

334
00:30:16,791 --> 00:30:18,999
This is not a car. This is a wreck.

335
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,583
Anyone brings it from anywhere...

336
00:30:20,584 --> 00:30:22,416
...and sells it according
to it's weight.

337
00:30:22,417 --> 00:30:24,541
I want to buy it. How
much will it cost?

338
00:30:24,542 --> 00:30:26,583
It must be a wreck worth
five thousand.

339
00:30:26,584 --> 00:30:28,707
Five thousand?

340
00:30:28,708 --> 00:30:32,500
I will give you five thousand.
But I don't have it right now.

341
00:30:32,584 --> 00:30:34,416
I will take it after a week.

342
00:30:34,417 --> 00:30:36,416
All this won't do. Talk
if you have cash.

343
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:37,832
It has half rotted already.

344
00:30:37,833 --> 00:30:39,915
Uncle, the haste that
you have to sell it...

345
00:30:39,916 --> 00:30:42,041
...I have a bigger haste to buy it.

346
00:30:42,042 --> 00:30:45,708
This car belongs to my papa.
Just a week uncle, please?

347
00:30:47,958 --> 00:30:52,874
Okay. But I won't keep
it for more than a week.

348
00:30:52,875 --> 00:30:58,208
Thank me after a week.

349
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:06,500
Grandma...
- Yes? - Grandma! - Yes!

350
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,416
Hey, what is the matter?

351
00:31:10,417 --> 00:31:12,458
You seem happier than seventy
five percent today.

352
00:31:12,459 --> 00:31:14,790
My happiness doesn't have
any percentage today.

353
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:17,458
What is such that you got?
- Sit down at least.

354
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:19,416
What is the matter?

355
00:31:19,417 --> 00:31:22,416
Grandma, you loved papa
a lot, isn't it?

356
00:31:22,417 --> 00:31:26,292
You are asking a mother how
much she loves her son?

357
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:29,541
So you must be loving every
thing that papa had?

358
00:31:29,542 --> 00:31:31,541
You ask this of yourself.

359
00:31:31,542 --> 00:31:36,459
His color, character symbol,
whatever I have.

360
00:31:36,584 --> 00:31:39,041
All that is you itself.

361
00:31:39,042 --> 00:31:41,416
Why are you asking
me all this today?

362
00:31:41,417 --> 00:31:45,541
Grandma, I need five
thousand rupees.

363
00:31:45,542 --> 00:31:49,957
Five thousand rupees?
- Aren't they a lot?

364
00:31:49,958 --> 00:31:53,416
Where have you asked a lot ever?

365
00:31:53,417 --> 00:31:56,708
I have always have had
less to give you.

366
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:03,417
Why do you want them?

367
00:32:03,459 --> 00:32:05,541
Grandma, I will buy such
a thing for you...

368
00:32:05,542 --> 00:32:08,041
...Looking at which you
will be very happy.

369
00:32:08,042 --> 00:32:11,958
Son, I become happy
looking at you happy.

370
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,416
See, my investments
will open next week.

371
00:32:15,417 --> 00:32:21,291
I will take that and give
it to you. Okay?

372
00:32:35,542 --> 00:32:38,416
You work here?
- It's a part time job.

373
00:32:38,417 --> 00:32:41,540
Pocket money with training too.
- Yes.

374
00:32:41,541 --> 00:32:43,582
Your nose!
- It is a bit different, isn't it?

375
00:32:43,583 --> 00:32:47,416
It is similar to papa's.
- No, it has become black.

376
00:32:47,417 --> 00:32:52,834
Just a minute, I will clean it.

377
00:32:56,417 --> 00:33:00,624
Your papa's nose seems too good.

378
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:02,374
How did you come here?

379
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:07,583
I don't know. My car stops suddenly.
- I will rectify it right away.

380
00:33:08,375 --> 00:33:10,874
It seems that you haven't serviced
your car since a long time.

381
00:33:10,875 --> 00:33:16,291
I don't know. I never
saw it before this.

382
00:33:16,917 --> 00:33:20,625
How do you do your studies
and part time job together?

383
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:23,791
I manage it.
- Doesn't this hamper your studies?

384
00:33:23,917 --> 00:33:26,749
It does, but what can I do? There
isn't anyone to earn at home.

385
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:29,416
After my mom's demise in childhood,
I had my papa...

386
00:33:29,417 --> 00:33:33,832
...and he expired in a car accident.

387
00:33:33,833 --> 00:33:37,459
Do you stay alone now?
- No. I have my grandma with me.

388
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:43,416
Here, your car is rectified.

389
00:33:43,417 --> 00:33:45,749
What is the cost?
- Money? What money?

390
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:48,582
I have just tightened a screw.
And you thanked me.

391
00:33:48,583 --> 00:33:50,832
That is a lot itself. - No. You
will have to take the money.

392
00:33:50,833 --> 00:33:53,582
At hour place, we don't charge
for tightening the screws.

393
00:33:53,583 --> 00:33:55,416
If you ever have some
major work, don't...

394
00:33:55,417 --> 00:33:57,540
...take any tension I will
do everything for free.

395
00:33:57,541 --> 00:34:03,166
Bring your car sometime later,
I will have it serviced too.

396
00:34:12,625 --> 00:34:16,541
If you do like this, I will stand
on the street and do like this.

397
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,749
What did you say to that girl?

398
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:21,416
If it is some major job,
you will do it for free?

399
00:34:21,417 --> 00:34:24,583
You work taking thank you? Do it!

400
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:27,416
Instead of giving you money
in your envelope...

401
00:34:27,417 --> 00:34:29,416
...while giving you your salary,
I will write a thank you to you.

402
00:34:29,417 --> 00:34:30,999
But uncle...
- Shut up!

403
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,999
Why didn't you take
money from that girl?

404
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,416
Is this a charitable garage?

405
00:34:35,417 --> 00:34:38,458
I pay fifteen mechanics
to tighten screws.

406
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:42,792
When a car enters in this garage,
the charge is five hundred rupees.

407
00:34:42,917 --> 00:34:44,457
Uncle. I knew her.

408
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:47,415
If you knew her, go home
and tighten her screws.

409
00:34:47,416 --> 00:34:50,458
If you tighten screws here,
I will loosen your screws.

410
00:34:50,583 --> 00:34:52,916
Uncle, this thing won't repeat.

411
00:34:52,917 --> 00:34:54,540
See. I will cut your
five hundred rupees.

412
00:34:54,541 --> 00:34:55,999
And if you ever do something
like this...

413
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,415
...I will cut your whole
salary and sack you.

414
00:34:59,416 --> 00:35:00,916
Go, go and work.

415
00:35:00,917 --> 00:35:04,374
Yes, uncle.

416
00:35:04,375 --> 00:35:08,916
Yes, uncle.

417
00:35:11,708 --> 00:35:13,415
What are you doing?

418
00:35:13,416 --> 00:35:15,457
Papa, I am putting
oil in the engine.

419
00:35:15,458 --> 00:35:17,374
Oh! You son of an ass! This is not...

420
00:35:17,375 --> 00:35:20,374
...the bottle of a engine oil. It
is the bottle of Roohafza sorbet.

421
00:35:20,375 --> 00:35:22,374
Shut up!

422
00:35:22,375 --> 00:35:23,540
Yes, uncle?

423
00:35:23,541 --> 00:35:25,791
Close him in the boot of some car.
- But papa!

424
00:35:25,792 --> 00:35:27,791
He has started opening bonnets.

425
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,875
How will I learn, papa?
- What are you learning?

426
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,749
You are putting all my eating
and drinks inside cars.

427
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:36,415
Don't see any difference
between car and Kartar?

428
00:35:36,416 --> 00:35:40,415
Get lost from here!

429
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:43,415
See, Raj. You hide and look
at her in the library.

430
00:35:43,416 --> 00:35:45,457
You risk your life to
return her purse.

431
00:35:45,458 --> 00:35:47,415
And you repair her car for free.

432
00:35:47,416 --> 00:35:49,916
And your expression says
that you like Priya.

433
00:35:49,917 --> 00:35:52,083
If you do like here, then tell her.

434
00:35:52,084 --> 00:35:53,749
See, it is the rose day tomorrow.

435
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,415
You go and offer her
a rose tomorrow.

436
00:35:55,416 --> 00:36:00,333
If she does accept it, you
have got your answer.

437
00:36:00,334 --> 00:36:01,707
And what if she doesn't?

438
00:36:01,708 --> 00:36:03,749
She will throw the
rose at your face.

439
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:09,374
But you won't be insulted
by that, understood?

440
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:14,750
The idea is not that bad.

441
00:36:39,416 --> 00:36:42,958
Only Miss Oxford is worthy
of giving a rose this year.

442
00:36:43,416 --> 00:36:46,792
Will she take the rose? - Yes. -

443
00:36:46,917 --> 00:36:53,125
She will take all our four roses.
- Yes?

444
00:36:53,416 --> 00:36:56,666
Did you understand it?
- Yes, sir. - Now go.

445
00:36:56,667 --> 00:37:00,916
See, the batter has come too.

446
00:37:00,917 --> 00:37:03,540
See. What black and yellow
coat has he worn?

447
00:37:03,541 --> 00:37:04,874
He looks like a taxi.

448
00:37:04,875 --> 00:37:06,916
This yellow suit,
suites you very much.

449
00:37:06,917 --> 00:37:09,791
Okay, listen. Look at that.

450
00:37:09,792 --> 00:37:15,208
Go with confidence and
give her the rose.

451
00:37:28,375 --> 00:37:31,416
Is this for me?
- Yes, it is for you.

452
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:35,333
How could you dare to
wish me rose day?

453
00:37:37,375 --> 00:37:39,540
I befriended you thinking that
you were a simple boy...

454
00:37:39,541 --> 00:37:41,832
...and you took this
meaning out of it?

455
00:37:41,833 --> 00:37:43,916
I didn't know that these
cat eyes look...

456
00:37:43,917 --> 00:37:49,417
...at me with this meaning
beneath these spectacles.

457
00:37:57,416 --> 00:38:02,582
What are you hiding?
- Nothing.

458
00:38:02,583 --> 00:38:04,499
Okay, come on. We will dance.

459
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,749
No, I don't know how to dance.

460
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:07,499
Which competition is going
on here? Come on!

461
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:11,332
But even then, I don't
know how to dance.

462
00:38:11,333 --> 00:38:12,916
Hey, what's this!

463
00:38:12,917 --> 00:38:17,457
The glass with the intoxication
pills has been taken by the battery!

464
00:38:17,458 --> 00:38:19,415
The plan is ruined!

465
00:38:19,416 --> 00:38:20,916
No, it is good.

466
00:38:20,917 --> 00:38:22,874
The battery will be
intoxicated now...

467
00:38:22,875 --> 00:38:24,499
...and he will act insolently
with her.

468
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:28,250
Now Miss Oxford will slap
him and put him to a side.

469
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:55,415
What happened, Raj?
- What happened?

470
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:58,792
I will tell you what happened
right now. - Come on.

471
00:38:58,959 --> 00:39:01,999
I haven't come here to jog
wearing this yellow suit.

472
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,416
You asked me what I
was hiding, isn't it?

473
00:39:06,333 --> 00:39:11,292
I was hiding this, this!

474
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:17,542
I started loving you when I saw you
for the first time in the college.

475
00:39:20,333 --> 00:39:22,707
I started seeing you everywhere.

476
00:39:22,708 --> 00:39:25,707
I became so worthless in your love...

477
00:39:25,708 --> 00:39:27,707
...that I started to see
you in my grandma too.

478
00:39:27,708 --> 00:39:30,791
Even then, I didn't have strength
to express my love.

479
00:39:30,792 --> 00:39:35,958
Then my friend Vicky understood
my sickness.

480
00:39:35,959 --> 00:39:40,416
Vicky said, ' Raj, love is not
silent, love is violent! '

481
00:39:40,625 --> 00:39:43,541
Even I have become violent!

482
00:39:43,542 --> 00:39:48,750
Hey, black crows...

483
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,583
If you love me, accept it,
or throw it on my face.

484
00:39:59,416 --> 00:40:03,291
I will not be insulted. Even
this, my friend told me.

485
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:08,625
Now, whether you love me or not,
I will tell everybody!

486
00:41:16,417 --> 00:41:20,291
'When I saw you, I felt like this.'

487
00:41:20,417 --> 00:41:24,458
'The magic of love set in my heart.'

488
00:41:24,583 --> 00:41:26,916
'The aroma was mixed in the air.'

489
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:29,416
'The heart beats got a romance.'

490
00:41:29,417 --> 00:41:35,209
' My state was excited! '

491
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:09,416
'Without you... '

492
00:42:09,417 --> 00:42:11,999
'Without you, I am not interested
in anything.'

493
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,458
'Without you... O beloved! O beloved!

494
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:21,458
' I stopped and refuse my heart,
but it didn't agree! '

495
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:25,792
'O beloved! O beloved! '

496
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:34,458
' Ever since I got your love,
this is going on.'

497
00:43:17,667 --> 00:43:21,458
'There was some excitement
in these breaths, my love.'

498
00:43:21,584 --> 00:43:26,458
' My beloved! My beloved! '

499
00:43:26,584 --> 00:43:31,458
'Your dreams settled in
my eyes, my beloved! '

500
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,458
' I just ask God this now! '

501
00:43:40,584 --> 00:43:44,625
' I should not leave
your embrace now.'

502
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:47,416
Hey, Raj. You here?

503
00:44:47,417 --> 00:44:52,292
Grandma said that I said a lot
about you last night in my sleep.

504
00:44:52,417 --> 00:44:55,625
You would have. You said
a lot in my presence too.

505
00:44:55,833 --> 00:44:57,082
What did I say?

506
00:44:57,083 --> 00:45:00,791
Sit in the car, I will tell you.

507
00:45:00,792 --> 00:45:02,915
Do you know? You had drunk
a lot yesterday.

508
00:45:02,916 --> 00:45:05,374
No. I haven't even touched
liquor till now.

509
00:45:05,375 --> 00:45:07,374
I think that someone did
some mischief with me.

510
00:45:07,375 --> 00:45:08,915
Someone had surely mixed
something in my drink.

511
00:45:08,916 --> 00:45:10,749
Whoever did this mischief
did a good thing.

512
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:12,874
You seem so simple from inside...

513
00:45:12,875 --> 00:45:15,541
...but you are a rascal from inside.
- Rascal?

514
00:45:15,542 --> 00:45:18,374
Not a rascal and great rascal.
Do you know what you did?

515
00:45:18,375 --> 00:45:21,374
You danced and made everyone
else dance too.

516
00:45:21,375 --> 00:45:23,624
You dance very well.

517
00:45:23,625 --> 00:45:26,416
But you did one mistake.
- What?

518
00:45:26,417 --> 00:45:27,915
You know? You gave me your rose.

519
00:45:27,916 --> 00:45:30,416
But you snatched your neighbor's
rose and gave me.

520
00:45:30,417 --> 00:45:31,957
You expressed your love to
me in everyone's presence.

521
00:45:31,958 --> 00:45:34,416
And that too under intoxication?

522
00:45:34,417 --> 00:45:36,832
I didn't like this action of yours.

523
00:45:36,833 --> 00:45:39,416
You expressed your love,
but under intoxication?

524
00:45:39,417 --> 00:45:43,459
Love is expressed in all
sanity. Like this.

525
00:45:49,833 --> 00:45:54,458
Did you understand?

526
00:46:08,375 --> 00:46:11,458
I wanted to apologize to you
for yesterday's mistake.

527
00:46:11,459 --> 00:46:14,541
I thought that our friendship
would be over today too.

528
00:46:14,542 --> 00:46:18,458
But I have got you today.
- I had got you yesterday itself.

529
00:46:18,459 --> 00:46:21,374
Today is a very happy day for me.

530
00:46:21,375 --> 00:46:24,417
What I am going to buy
is my most loved thing.

531
00:46:24,542 --> 00:46:30,000
Most loved thing?
- Stop the car.

532
00:46:31,459 --> 00:46:32,915
What is here?

533
00:46:32,916 --> 00:46:35,624
That loved thing is here itself.

534
00:46:35,625 --> 00:46:39,416
Yes, let it come, let it come back.

535
00:46:39,417 --> 00:46:45,291
Attach it quickly. Will
you take the whole day?

536
00:46:46,417 --> 00:46:48,749
Hey, what are you doing,
where are you taking it?

537
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:51,458
To melt it and make it into
iron. I have bought it.

538
00:46:51,459 --> 00:46:54,082
To melt it? But I was to buy it.
- I don't know that.

539
00:46:54,083 --> 00:46:59,125
Go and talk to Patel about it.

540
00:46:59,417 --> 00:47:00,832
Uncle, you sold this car!

541
00:47:00,833 --> 00:47:02,749
You said that you would
buy it in a week.

542
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:04,332
It is the ten days today,
you didn't come.

543
00:47:04,333 --> 00:47:05,749
But uncle, the money could be
arranged last night itself.

544
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:07,332
I came yesterday morning,
but you weren't there.

545
00:47:07,333 --> 00:47:08,541
But it is sold now.

546
00:47:08,542 --> 00:47:10,707
Take the car back from
him and give it to me.

547
00:47:10,708 --> 00:47:12,790
Take it back? How will
I take it back?

548
00:47:12,791 --> 00:47:15,541
He has given me the money.
He is my old client.

549
00:47:15,542 --> 00:47:21,959
I will err in my counting. You
go. Let me count the money.

550
00:47:23,375 --> 00:47:26,750
It is iron for you. But for me...
it is a priceless thing for me.

551
00:47:26,875 --> 00:47:29,374
You take all my money and... please...

552
00:47:29,375 --> 00:47:32,416
What is so special in this scrap
that you are so worried?

553
00:47:32,417 --> 00:47:35,584
This isn't scrap, Priya.
This is my papa's car.

554
00:47:35,708 --> 00:47:39,999
This is my papa's possession.
He loved it a lot.

555
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,417
Uncle, you want to make
iron out of a car.

556
00:47:43,666 --> 00:47:46,832
Any car of scrap will do for you.
Please give me this car.

557
00:47:46,833 --> 00:47:50,665
I beg you! I request you!

558
00:47:50,666 --> 00:47:56,792
Take this money and
give me this car.

559
00:47:57,083 --> 00:47:59,665
Okay, take this car.

560
00:47:59,666 --> 00:48:03,542
Our work is to melt iron. Not
to melt anyone's emotions.

561
00:48:05,334 --> 00:48:10,291
Give him this car.

562
00:48:26,459 --> 00:48:30,374
Grandma?

563
00:48:30,375 --> 00:48:33,374
Didn't I tell you that I would
bring something looking...

564
00:48:33,375 --> 00:48:36,417
...at which you will be happy?
Look at this, Papa's car.

565
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:05,542
' I believe in you! '

566
00:49:05,666 --> 00:49:10,625
Come on, mother. You sit here.
And you sit here.

567
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:16,042
One photo with my Tarzan.

568
00:49:25,625 --> 00:49:27,374
Grandma...

569
00:49:27,375 --> 00:49:32,917
For a moment, I thought
that you brought my son.

570
00:49:34,459 --> 00:49:36,374
Yes, grandma.

571
00:49:36,375 --> 00:49:40,750
When I saw it for the first time,
I thought that my papa was with me.

572
00:49:42,459 --> 00:49:45,750
I will make it now, grandma.
I will design it.

573
00:49:47,375 --> 00:49:50,957
I know that it will
cost a lot of money.

574
00:49:50,958 --> 00:49:52,749
But I will work day
and night for it.

575
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:54,416
I will do overtime.

576
00:49:54,417 --> 00:49:56,916
I will make it such a car
with my mechanical skills...

577
00:49:56,917 --> 00:50:03,000
...and hard work that people
will be stunned.

578
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:07,749
Granda, this is Priya.

579
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:09,665
Greetings.
- Bless you.

580
00:50:09,666 --> 00:50:11,416
This is the same London
one, isn't it?

581
00:50:11,417 --> 00:50:13,832
About whom you were saying?
- Yes.

582
00:50:13,833 --> 00:50:19,291
You go inside, I will come.

583
00:50:26,417 --> 00:50:28,416
Who is there?

584
00:50:28,417 --> 00:50:29,999
I am Raj, uncle.

585
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,874
Hey, you haven't gone home
so late in the night?

586
00:50:32,875 --> 00:50:34,749
You haven't gone home?
- I am doing overtime.

587
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:37,416
If you do part time in the day
and overtime in the night...

588
00:50:37,417 --> 00:50:39,707
...when will you do your studies?

589
00:50:39,708 --> 00:50:42,416
I need money.

590
00:50:42,417 --> 00:50:46,375
What is the matter? Is there
some problem in the house?

591
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,874
No, uncle.

592
00:50:48,875 --> 00:50:52,917
Son, barring Lakshmi and Kuber
everyone needs money.

593
00:50:53,417 --> 00:50:55,582
But what is so serious, for which...

594
00:50:55,583 --> 00:50:57,749
...you are ready to leave
your studies too?

595
00:50:57,750 --> 00:51:01,417
I had told you about my papa,
isn't it? He had a car.

596
00:51:01,541 --> 00:51:06,958
I have got it after twelve years.

597
00:51:16,417 --> 00:51:19,999
I want to make that car once again.

598
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:25,792
Son, the kids of nowadays throw
their parents from the house.

599
00:51:27,416 --> 00:51:30,415
And you are doing such a sacrifice...

600
00:51:30,416 --> 00:51:36,125
...to save your father's memoirs?

601
00:51:36,416 --> 00:51:42,708
You make that car. I am
with you. And see son.

602
00:51:44,042 --> 00:51:46,749
You are doing some part
time in my garage...

603
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:49,749
...you do that. Instead of the
over time in my garage...

604
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:52,833
...you spend that time
making your car.

605
00:51:53,416 --> 00:51:59,833
I will pay you for the hours that
you put in making that car.

606
00:52:03,375 --> 00:52:06,415
All of us are mechanics.

607
00:52:06,416 --> 00:52:08,916
It is not only our profession
to rectify problems.

608
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:14,083
It is also our religion.

609
00:52:44,875 --> 00:52:46,415
You didn't go to the camp?

610
00:52:46,416 --> 00:52:48,415
When you did go there,
what will I do there?

611
00:52:48,416 --> 00:52:50,415
I can't help you in
building the car.

612
00:52:50,416 --> 00:52:55,625
But I can be with you, isn't it?

613
00:53:16,667 --> 00:53:21,292
'You are my craze, you
are my ambition.'

614
00:53:21,416 --> 00:53:25,708
'You exist in my breaths,
you are my heart.'

615
00:53:25,792 --> 00:53:33,792
'You are the emotion attached
to my heart.'

616
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:58,833
' My name, my work... '

617
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:27,583
'Why did my heart beat
as soon as I saw you? '

618
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:34,792
' My hopes increased, there
was a dream in my eyes.'

619
00:54:59,416 --> 00:55:04,250
'Our friendship is different
in this whole world.

620
00:55:05,959 --> 00:55:10,667
'There is a procession of
memoirs at every curve.'

621
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,917
'The emotions are deep.
You and I know this.'

622
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:48,458
'The relation is very delicate.
You and I know this.'

623
00:57:44,417 --> 00:57:47,583
Why are you tying this Tarzan?
- This car is named Tarzan.

624
00:57:48,417 --> 00:57:51,416
Yes. My dad had named
this car Tarzan.

625
00:57:51,417 --> 00:57:53,416
So, should we go on a
drive in this Tarzan?

626
00:57:53,417 --> 00:57:54,582
No, Priya.

627
00:57:54,583 --> 00:57:56,582
This car won't start now.
- Why?

628
00:57:56,583 --> 00:57:58,999
It's fuel pump has jammed
because of rust.

629
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,916
I have tried a lot but
it didn't open up.

630
00:58:00,917 --> 00:58:04,582
I have spoken to uncle. He
will arrange something.

631
00:58:04,583 --> 00:58:08,332
Okay. Thank you.

632
00:58:08,333 --> 00:58:10,416
What happened, uncle?

633
00:58:10,417 --> 00:58:14,208
Son, I tried a lot.
I spoke to some...

634
00:58:14,333 --> 00:58:19,250
...people who keep old cars,
I asked scrap dealers...

635
00:58:19,375 --> 00:58:21,874
...nobody has it. That company...

636
00:58:21,875 --> 00:58:25,583
...has even stopped making
cars of that model.

637
00:58:27,375 --> 00:58:31,792
Therefore, son. It is difficult
to get that fuel pump.

638
00:58:34,375 --> 00:58:39,750
Now, you can only believe in God.

639
00:59:02,667 --> 00:59:04,582
Son, didn't you sleep?

640
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:08,332
I am not feeling sleepy, grandma.

641
00:59:08,333 --> 00:59:10,833
Even after so much hard
work and tries...

642
00:59:10,834 --> 00:59:13,332
...the fuel pump couldn't
be got. I think...

643
00:59:13,333 --> 00:59:15,666
...that my Tarzan will
not be able to run now.

644
00:59:15,667 --> 00:59:17,332
Why will it not be able to work?

645
00:59:17,333 --> 00:59:21,625
If God didn't wish it, how
would you get this car?

646
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:25,375
He gave you strength to make
such a beautiful car.

647
00:59:25,625 --> 00:59:29,583
Have faith in him. He will
show you some way out.

648
00:59:30,625 --> 00:59:36,833
Sleep, son. Sleep.

649
01:02:02,791 --> 01:02:04,374
Grandma!

650
01:02:04,375 --> 01:02:07,791
The fuel pump is made, grandma!
My Tarzan has started, grandma!

651
01:02:11,417 --> 01:02:12,832
Did you see that, son?

652
01:02:12,833 --> 01:02:15,416
The fuel pump was made by
God's grace, isn't it?

653
01:02:15,417 --> 01:02:17,749
There won't be such a
car in the whole world.

654
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:23,125
Bless you! Bless you!

655
01:02:53,417 --> 01:02:56,874
Wow! What a car!

656
01:02:56,875 --> 01:03:01,458
Hey, this is not a car.
This is great!

657
01:03:01,459 --> 01:03:06,957
I haven't seen such
a car in my dreams!

658
01:03:06,958 --> 01:03:12,250
Hey! This is the battery!

659
01:03:12,375 --> 01:03:14,416
And he has Miss Oxford with him too.

660
01:03:14,417 --> 01:03:16,832
This is my papa's favorite
restaurant.

661
01:03:16,833 --> 01:03:20,374
Why, grandma? Didn't papa bring
you here often? - Yes, son.

662
01:03:20,375 --> 01:03:21,874
Hey, how did this happen?

663
01:03:21,875 --> 01:03:23,583
From a cycle to a car
all of a sudden?

664
01:03:23,584 --> 01:03:25,999
I see Miss Oxford's support in this.

665
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,583
Battery's state and face,
both have changed.

666
01:03:28,584 --> 01:03:33,749
He snatched the morsel
from our mouth.

667
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:36,374
He is showing off a lot.

668
01:03:36,375 --> 01:03:39,500
Today, we will change his face.

669
01:03:43,375 --> 01:03:47,959
Come on!

670
01:03:53,417 --> 01:03:54,583
That's strange, battery.

671
01:03:54,584 --> 01:03:56,583
You have become Pran
from Kanhayalal.

672
01:03:56,584 --> 01:03:59,666
Is it Miss Oxford's backing,
or dad's insurance?

673
01:04:06,459 --> 01:04:12,500
You made this fool a foreigner.

674
01:04:13,375 --> 01:04:15,874
Don't do this two much and
three much in front of us.

675
01:04:15,875 --> 01:04:17,957
Or I will change the close
up of your face.

676
01:04:17,958 --> 01:04:21,624
What insolence is this? Leave her!
- Shut up! Old woman!

677
01:04:21,625 --> 01:04:24,749
Raj, no! Wait Raj!

678
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:26,749
Grandma, he has insulted you!

679
01:04:26,750 --> 01:04:32,375
I will show them how
much is two and two.

680
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:35,625
I won't spare him!
- Leave me!

681
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:39,541
Wait!

682
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:41,749
Wait! Or else I will have
to call the police.

683
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:43,832
Mother, you please take him.

684
01:04:43,833 --> 01:04:46,749
C'mon, dear - Wait!

685
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:49,374
We are going. That's
it. We are going.

686
01:04:49,375 --> 01:04:53,416
Leave us.

687
01:04:53,417 --> 01:04:54,583
Wait!

688
01:04:54,584 --> 01:04:56,583
Where are you going? Are you
getting scared and running?

689
01:04:56,584 --> 01:04:59,874
Where are you hiding with women?
If you have the guts, come out!

690
01:04:59,875 --> 01:05:01,458
He has run away! That wretch!

691
01:05:01,459 --> 01:05:02,707
Don't worry.

692
01:05:02,708 --> 01:05:04,957
We will break him and
his car tomorrow...

693
01:05:04,958 --> 01:05:10,208
...morning, outside the college.

694
01:06:06,708 --> 01:06:09,041
The battery has insulted
us a lot today.

695
01:06:09,042 --> 01:06:10,707
If the guards hadn't
come in between...

696
01:06:10,708 --> 01:06:12,374
...I would have made
such a state of his...

697
01:06:12,375 --> 01:06:15,374
...he wouldn't have faced
us throughout his life.

698
01:06:15,375 --> 01:06:18,750
Hey, who is there? Shut
down the light!

699
01:06:18,958 --> 01:06:23,374
Hey, shut down the light!

700
01:06:23,375 --> 01:06:25,707
Hey, it is battery.

701
01:06:25,708 --> 01:06:29,250
It seems that he is unlucky. He has
come in the lion's claws himself.

702
01:06:29,375 --> 01:06:31,416
Come on, we will settle
his hands and legs.

703
01:06:31,417 --> 01:06:34,374
As it is, there isn't
any lame student...

704
01:06:34,375 --> 01:06:40,291
...in the college who
comes on crutches.

705
01:06:41,750 --> 01:06:42,874
Hey wait! Hey wait!

706
01:06:42,875 --> 01:06:45,540
Hey, where are you running!
Hey! Catch him! Fast.

707
01:06:45,541 --> 01:06:50,166
C'mon, hurry up!

708
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:03,333
Where are you hiding, you coward?

709
01:07:03,334 --> 01:07:05,416
There he is. Behind that pillar.

710
01:07:05,417 --> 01:07:08,833
Catch him. Don't let him escape.
- You Battery, wait there. Come out.

711
01:07:08,917 --> 01:07:11,416
Hey catch him.
- Where are you running to?

712
01:07:11,417 --> 01:07:13,874
Break its glass.
- But how?

713
01:07:13,875 --> 01:07:17,374
Throw your helmet into it.

714
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:21,250
He thinks he's a hero. Catch him.
- We'll break his legs today.

715
01:07:21,375 --> 01:07:24,374
Why do you run, stop.
- I will break your limbs today.

716
01:07:24,375 --> 01:07:29,417
Maxi, catch him. Vicky,
don't let him get away.

717
01:07:34,375 --> 01:07:37,374
Stop!

718
01:07:37,375 --> 01:07:42,374
Are we chasing him
or he's chasing us?

719
01:07:42,375 --> 01:07:44,540
How did he come behind us?

720
01:07:44,541 --> 01:07:50,292
I am running out of gas.

721
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:01,333
Hey you, son of a dog!

722
01:08:01,334 --> 01:08:05,333
Do you think you are very
smart sitting inside?

723
01:08:05,334 --> 01:08:10,875
Just come outside then you'll see
how I break you hands and legs.

724
01:08:13,917 --> 01:08:19,208
Hey, Battery threw
him in the gutters.

725
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:36,374
He'll die.
- Someone should save him.

726
01:08:36,375 --> 01:08:38,374
You should go.
- No, you should go.

727
01:08:38,375 --> 01:08:40,874
You should go.
- You should go.

728
01:08:40,875 --> 01:08:43,374
Hey, go now.

729
01:08:43,375 --> 01:08:45,707
Bunty, are you alive?
- Yes, I'm alive.

730
01:08:45,708 --> 01:08:47,540
Open it, quickly. It stinks in here.

731
01:08:47,541 --> 01:08:52,750
Just hold your breath,
I'll be right there.

732
01:09:00,334 --> 01:09:04,875
Help me.

733
01:09:33,708 --> 01:09:34,874
I never thought, that Battery...

734
01:09:34,875 --> 01:09:40,083
...would turn out to be
so dangerous. - Yes.

735
01:09:40,875 --> 01:09:43,540
What are you doing up there?
- Come down soon.

736
01:09:43,541 --> 01:09:45,957
Where is Battery?

737
01:09:45,958 --> 01:09:50,374
What is this shh?

738
01:09:50,375 --> 01:09:51,707
Why are you banging your head?

739
01:09:51,708 --> 01:09:53,540
Can't you speak, you baldy?
Have you become dumb?

740
01:09:53,541 --> 01:09:57,792
Baldy, get down. Got dumb? And
why are you crying?

741
01:09:57,875 --> 01:10:00,666
Have you gone mad? Where
is that Battery?

742
01:10:00,667 --> 01:10:05,292
Run!

743
01:10:05,375 --> 01:10:08,374
Get inside!

744
01:10:08,375 --> 01:10:13,292
There!

745
01:10:13,833 --> 01:10:19,292
Hey, what are you doing?
- My hands are stuck.

746
01:10:19,375 --> 01:10:23,666
Who is it? - I think someone
is coming. Hide here.

747
01:10:23,667 --> 01:10:27,415
Run!

748
01:10:27,416 --> 01:10:30,625
We are stuck! Pull!

749
01:10:33,416 --> 01:10:35,415
How did you two get in?

750
01:10:35,416 --> 01:10:38,833
Hello uncle. We two got stuck
to each other. Please, help us.

751
01:10:38,917 --> 01:10:42,707
You spilled all my fevicol? - No,
we didn't. It got spilled by itself.

752
01:10:42,708 --> 01:10:44,832
We are stuck together. Separate us.

753
01:10:44,833 --> 01:10:47,582
Now I'll stick you
two in such a way...

754
01:10:47,583 --> 01:10:53,500
...as we stick ply to wood.

755
01:10:57,875 --> 01:10:59,916
Enough Raj, don't come ahead.

756
01:10:59,917 --> 01:11:01,874
Or else the car will run over us.

757
01:11:01,875 --> 01:11:04,540
No Raj. - You have squeezed
out our hooliganism.

758
01:11:04,541 --> 01:11:07,540
And only we know from
where it came out.

759
01:11:07,541 --> 01:11:09,874
No Raj. We didn't know that
if we say something...

760
01:11:09,875 --> 01:11:11,916
...to your granny then you'll
become so violent.

761
01:11:11,917 --> 01:11:15,374
Please, spare us, Raj.
- Forgive us, Raj.

762
01:11:15,375 --> 01:11:17,707
Please, we beg of you.
- Forgive us, Raj.

763
01:11:17,708 --> 01:11:24,125
We'll never do this again.
We are sorry.

764
01:11:26,833 --> 01:11:29,832
We are saved.

765
01:11:29,833 --> 01:11:35,292
We had so much of fun.

766
01:11:39,416 --> 01:11:45,167
Raj? What a car Raj has brought!

767
01:11:46,875 --> 01:11:50,415
I've never even seen
such a car in books.

768
01:11:50,416 --> 01:11:52,415
I made this car after
thinking that only.

769
01:11:52,416 --> 01:11:54,415
Your whole life is set, pal.
After finishing college...

770
01:11:54,416 --> 01:11:56,415
...you start your own workshop.
And design such...

771
01:11:56,416 --> 01:11:58,415
...beautiful cars in it. Just
watch as all the automobile...

772
01:11:58,416 --> 01:12:03,916
...companies will have to
pull down their shutters.

773
01:12:05,458 --> 01:12:07,374
Raj, if you meet Rocky
and his friends...

774
01:12:07,375 --> 01:12:09,541
...then just stay away from them.
- Why?

775
01:12:09,542 --> 01:12:12,374
Any problems?
- Yes.

776
01:12:12,375 --> 01:12:18,083
Brother Raj!
- Brother Raj!

777
01:12:21,667 --> 01:12:24,541
Brother Raj, please forgive us.

778
01:12:24,542 --> 01:12:25,958
What has happened to you all?

779
01:12:25,959 --> 01:12:27,541
Didn't brother Raj
tell you anything?

780
01:12:27,542 --> 01:12:29,541
What would I tell? I
don't know anything.

781
01:12:29,542 --> 01:12:32,541
You don't know? Even we don't know.

782
01:12:32,542 --> 01:12:34,374
We all have forgotten everything.

783
01:12:34,375 --> 01:12:37,374
You didn't kill us, isn't
that a big favor itself?

784
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:39,541
Raj, did you do all this?
- Forget it, sister Priya.

785
01:12:39,542 --> 01:12:41,415
With the evil intentions
we use to see you...

786
01:12:41,416 --> 01:12:43,707
...now we'll never see
you that way again.

787
01:12:43,708 --> 01:12:46,415
If any of our eyes survive
then we'll see...

788
01:12:46,416 --> 01:12:48,749
...you mother with one eye
and sister with the other.

789
01:12:48,750 --> 01:12:50,749
If we had one more eye
then we would have...

790
01:12:50,750 --> 01:12:53,041
...saw you as grandmother.
But we don't have any.

791
01:12:53,042 --> 01:12:54,749
Did you see? This happens when...

792
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:56,916
...a decent guy looses his decency.

793
01:12:56,917 --> 01:12:59,415
A decent guy loosing his
decency and becomes...

794
01:12:59,416 --> 01:13:01,707
...so dangerous, this is the
first time I have ever seen.

795
01:13:01,708 --> 01:13:04,374
Our hearts came up to our necks.

796
01:13:04,375 --> 01:13:08,250
You just say it once that go
away dogs, I forgive you.

797
01:13:08,375 --> 01:13:10,374
C'mon Raj, forgive them.

798
01:13:10,375 --> 01:13:12,707
C'mon now go into the class.
And don't let me watch you.

799
01:13:12,708 --> 01:13:15,791
Thank you, brother.
- May God always bless you.

800
01:13:15,792 --> 01:13:21,250
Just take care of yourself.
- Yes, move. C'mon!

801
01:14:25,667 --> 01:14:28,374
Yes Mr. Narang.

802
01:14:28,375 --> 01:14:30,374
You run your bulldozers
on their slums...

803
01:14:30,375 --> 01:14:31,708
...without any worries.

804
01:14:31,709 --> 01:14:34,374
I want that land to
be cleared in a week.

805
01:14:34,375 --> 01:14:37,458
I'm coming to Palghar tomorrow.
We'll discuss the rest there itself.

806
01:14:38,375 --> 01:14:40,541
Where are you getting the
bulldozers to run over?

807
01:14:40,542 --> 01:14:41,874
In a slum at Palghar.

808
01:14:41,875 --> 01:14:44,541
I'm constructing a two-wheeler
factory there on your name.

809
01:14:44,542 --> 01:14:47,625
Ladybird bicycle and moppet
company. Did you like it?

810
01:14:48,375 --> 01:14:50,708
This Four Fox company
will soon shut down.

811
01:14:50,709 --> 01:14:52,541
And my partners are thinking
of starting...

812
01:14:52,542 --> 01:14:54,708
...a business in poultry
and garments.

813
01:14:54,709 --> 01:14:56,416
That's why I thought, in your name...

814
01:14:56,417 --> 01:14:58,749
...I would bring up our
own empire and...

815
01:14:58,750 --> 01:15:04,375
...then throw my partners out
within 2-4 years. Let's go.

816
01:15:31,375 --> 01:15:34,374
Raj!
- Yes, uncle.

817
01:15:34,375 --> 01:15:36,374
Raj, go to Mr. Singhania's house.

818
01:15:36,375 --> 01:15:38,374
He's having car troubles.

819
01:15:38,375 --> 01:15:40,040
Uncle, Mr. Deepak's car's
windscreen need to be changed.

820
01:15:40,041 --> 01:15:42,874
And we have to deliver it today.
- I'll get that changed from Manglu.

821
01:15:42,875 --> 01:15:44,541
You take the towing car with you.

822
01:15:44,542 --> 01:15:46,708
If Mr. Singhania's car doesn't
gets fixed till evening...

823
01:15:46,709 --> 01:15:48,708
...then tow it to the garage. Go.
- Yes.

824
01:15:48,709 --> 01:15:50,457
Hey Golu.
- Yes papa.

825
01:15:50,458 --> 01:15:53,541
Go and tell Manglu to change Mr.
Deepak's car's windscreen.

826
01:15:53,542 --> 01:15:55,874
Which one should be fitted? Of
the fiat or of the ambassador?

827
01:15:55,875 --> 01:15:59,292
You mad fellow, how can you
fix some other windscreen?

828
01:15:59,417 --> 01:16:02,332
It can happen, papa. Lots of
people do this to save money.

829
01:16:02,333 --> 01:16:04,541
For example as today the fan belt
of D'souza's car was broken.

830
01:16:04,542 --> 01:16:06,374
So I told him, it'll
cost him Rs.110.

831
01:16:06,375 --> 01:16:08,374
But he said, no. He said
to use something cheaper.

832
01:16:08,375 --> 01:16:11,583
So do you know, I have attached
your pant's belt to it! - What?

833
01:16:11,709 --> 01:16:13,874
Yes. In the evening when you
wear it then you'll see...

834
01:16:13,875 --> 01:16:16,457
...that your pants would
keep on sliding down.

835
01:16:16,458 --> 01:16:20,374
Hey Manglu!
- Yes uncle.

836
01:16:20,375 --> 01:16:22,374
Manglu, take him and lock
him inside the house.

837
01:16:22,375 --> 01:16:28,250
Or else he'll get my garage
shut down. Take him. - C'mon.

838
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:39,584
Welcome, Mr. Chopra. Seeing
you after such a long time.

839
01:16:40,375 --> 01:16:43,374
Uncle, the headlights of my car
are broken. Just change it.

840
01:16:43,375 --> 01:16:45,666
I have to go to Palghar and
return by night today.

841
01:16:45,667 --> 01:16:47,708
By the ways Mr. Chopra,
it's believed that...

842
01:16:47,709 --> 01:16:49,374
...it's lucky when glass breaks.

843
01:16:49,375 --> 01:16:51,708
I think you'll have a
very lucky day today.

844
01:16:51,709 --> 01:16:53,833
These are all superstitions,
Mr. Singh.

845
01:16:53,834 --> 01:16:56,374
If this was possible
then I would have...

846
01:16:56,375 --> 01:16:58,374
...lived in a glass house. And
would have messed with...

847
01:16:58,375 --> 01:17:02,332
...every crazy man carrying a stone.

848
01:17:02,333 --> 01:17:04,708
If he believes it's lucky
then it becomes lucky.

849
01:17:04,709 --> 01:17:07,541
If he believes it's unlucky
then it becomes unlucky.

850
01:17:07,542 --> 01:17:08,915
Let's see, what happens.

851
01:17:08,916 --> 01:17:13,625
Come Mr. Chopra. Until we fix your
car lets sit in the office.

852
01:18:49,709 --> 01:18:54,750
What are you doing?

853
01:19:13,333 --> 01:19:14,666
Hey, what are you doing?

854
01:19:14,667 --> 01:19:19,875
Changing lanes giving
the wrong signal?

855
01:20:16,708 --> 01:20:21,792
Hey, you'll get me killed!

856
01:20:42,875 --> 01:20:44,999
These kids are getting irritated
standing in this heat...

857
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,832
...for the past 3 hours.
- What will we do for their food?

858
01:20:46,833 --> 01:20:48,915
We'll have to manage something.
We are very late.

859
01:20:48,916 --> 01:20:52,707
Hey, a car is coming.

860
01:20:52,708 --> 01:20:58,166
Stop!
- Please, stop!

861
01:21:09,375 --> 01:21:11,541
Look sir, we have been troubled
since the past 3 hours.

862
01:21:11,542 --> 01:21:15,374
Our bus is stuck. Please, help us.

863
01:21:15,375 --> 01:21:18,625
C'mon kids, get into
the bus. Hurry up.

864
01:22:17,375 --> 01:22:22,375
Hey, what are you doing?

865
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:46,791
It'll kill me! Someone save me.

866
01:25:36,209 --> 01:25:38,540
It's a very interesting funda.

867
01:25:38,541 --> 01:25:40,291
The crossing is broken
over there and...

868
01:25:40,292 --> 01:25:42,208
...the car is found burnt here.

869
01:25:42,209 --> 01:25:47,041
Even the body has been
burned to death.

870
01:25:47,042 --> 01:25:49,124
The entire area should
undergo proper...

871
01:25:49,125 --> 01:25:54,375
...forensic analysis and
detailed checking.

872
01:25:55,167 --> 01:25:57,041
This accident happened
due to this crossing.

873
01:25:57,042 --> 01:25:58,540
The breaks of the car
was not working...

874
01:25:58,541 --> 01:26:00,041
...so it broke the crossing,
rammed into the train...

875
01:26:00,042 --> 01:26:01,457
...and fell in the open ground
after blowing up.

876
01:26:01,458 --> 01:26:02,999
You are a gatemen.
Didn't you notice?

877
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,415
If there would have been
a flyover here then...

878
01:26:04,416 --> 01:26:05,999
...the car wouldn't have
rammed into the train.

879
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,499
Why don't you built a flyover
over the crossing?

880
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:09,249
Constable, we don't have any funds.

881
01:26:09,250 --> 01:26:12,124
The railway is suffering a loss.
- Even I travel by train.

882
01:26:12,125 --> 01:26:15,083
After booking the tickets
before 2 months...

883
01:26:15,084 --> 01:26:17,916
...240 passengers are stuffed
into a 40 passenger coach.

884
01:26:17,917 --> 01:26:19,415
And you are saying the railway
is suffering a loss.

885
01:26:19,416 --> 01:26:20,916
But sir why are you
telling me all this?

886
01:26:20,917 --> 01:26:22,249
Tell that to the government.
- Where is the government?

887
01:26:22,250 --> 01:26:25,041
Call him now.
- What?

888
01:26:25,042 --> 01:26:27,332
Sir, I have found out that
this is a useless case.

889
01:26:27,333 --> 01:26:28,916
You are unnecessarily
standing in the heat.

890
01:26:28,917 --> 01:26:30,415
Consider this as an accident
case. Close its file.

891
01:26:30,416 --> 01:26:34,041
Cool your head with ice and
rest at the police station.

892
01:26:34,042 --> 01:26:39,000
Sir, we have found tire marks of
some other car with this car.

893
01:26:41,209 --> 01:26:45,042
That means my suspicions are right.
This is a murder case...

894
01:26:45,125 --> 01:26:49,042
...which has been tried to
be covered as an accident.

895
01:26:52,042 --> 01:26:55,374
Now this case is in charge
of Mr. Khurana.

896
01:26:55,375 --> 01:26:58,499
Now the murderer's funda
won't work any more.

897
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:01,166
Now Khurana's stick
will do all the work.

898
01:27:01,167 --> 01:27:04,124
Listen! - Yes sir. - I want the
chassis number of this car...

899
01:27:04,125 --> 01:27:07,250
...and the postmortem report
of this dead body, urgently.

900
01:27:08,209 --> 01:27:14,292
From that we'll know
who the deceased was.

901
01:27:16,458 --> 01:27:18,083
Mrs. Chopra, you are saying...

902
01:27:18,084 --> 01:27:20,208
...there weren't any threatening
calls for extortions.

903
01:27:20,209 --> 01:27:21,582
But without enmity, without reason...

904
01:27:21,583 --> 01:27:23,208
...no one would murder someone.

905
01:27:23,209 --> 01:27:26,833
Inspector, he didn't
have any enemies.

906
01:27:27,209 --> 01:27:30,875
My husband was a very humane
and God like person.

907
01:27:32,250 --> 01:27:35,333
This is a strange generation.
Even God's are being murdered.

908
01:27:35,416 --> 01:27:39,041
They should also receive security.

909
01:27:39,042 --> 01:27:42,124
Alka, take sister-in-law inside.

910
01:27:42,125 --> 01:27:46,499
Who is this lame fellow?

911
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:51,875
What do you think can be the reason
for your partner's murder?

912
01:27:51,959 --> 01:27:53,958
What can we say, inspector?

913
01:27:53,959 --> 01:27:57,000
Since our brother like
partner has died...

914
01:27:57,125 --> 01:28:00,917
...if we even drink water then
it would come out as tears.

915
01:28:01,042 --> 01:28:03,540
It's the latest news.

916
01:28:03,541 --> 01:28:06,958
Daddy that...
- Shut up.

917
01:28:06,959 --> 01:28:11,166
Inspector, for him every
thing is latest.

918
01:28:11,167 --> 01:28:12,916
The inquiry has begun.

919
01:28:12,917 --> 01:28:19,375
If you people get to know something
then tell us about it.

920
01:28:20,208 --> 01:28:22,541
This is a new funda.

921
01:28:22,542 --> 01:28:24,083
When we were talking then...

922
01:28:24,084 --> 01:28:26,916
...what was the need
to speak in between?

923
01:28:26,917 --> 01:28:28,207
What's the latest news?

924
01:28:28,208 --> 01:28:31,916
Once I had heard you two talking.
- What?

925
01:28:31,917 --> 01:28:33,541
That Chopra should be
killed like dogs.

926
01:28:33,542 --> 01:28:35,916
What was the need to say it
in front of that inspector?

927
01:28:35,917 --> 01:28:37,582
So that the killers
get caught very soon.

928
01:28:37,583 --> 01:28:39,541
Anthony, what son have
you given birth to?

929
01:28:39,542 --> 01:28:41,582
Now explain him. He'll get
the both of us trapped.

930
01:28:41,583 --> 01:28:45,457
Go and get the car ready, Jojo. Go!

931
01:28:45,458 --> 01:28:47,207
Everything is ruined.
- What?

932
01:28:47,208 --> 01:28:49,124
Today there was a New Year's
party and this Chopra...

933
01:28:49,125 --> 01:28:51,124
...has flopped all our plans.
It would have been so nice...

934
01:28:51,125 --> 01:28:53,958
...if he would have
died after 4 days.

935
01:28:53,959 --> 01:28:55,457
At least we would have
enjoyed in the evening.

936
01:28:55,458 --> 01:28:58,207
Why won't we enjoy? He
wasn't our brother.

937
01:28:58,208 --> 01:29:01,333
He was a fraud partner. We
have given our condolences.

938
01:29:01,458 --> 01:29:04,374
We have cried our hearts out in
front of his photo for 45 minutes.

939
01:29:04,375 --> 01:29:07,499
Do you want to continue this,
your whole life?

940
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:09,041
One of the partners of
the Four Fox company...

941
01:29:09,042 --> 01:29:11,499
...has left this country. The
other has left this world.

942
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:13,874
And the remaining are we two.
Partners by fifty-fifty.

943
01:29:13,875 --> 01:29:19,125
In this joy we'll celebrate
the New year today.

944
01:29:52,208 --> 01:29:55,834
'Lf love is a mistake... '

945
01:30:02,291 --> 01:30:07,333
'... then I'll definitely
do it. Oh beautiful! '

946
01:30:19,166 --> 01:30:22,291
'Lf deaths is it's penalty... '

947
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:30,291
'... then I'll definitely
die. Oh beautiful! '

948
01:30:51,542 --> 01:30:54,082
Manager, I left my beautiful
wife at home...

949
01:30:54,083 --> 01:30:56,249
...with an excuse for a conference.
- Have you made...

950
01:30:56,250 --> 01:30:59,374
...any special arrangements
for the New year's party?

951
01:30:59,375 --> 01:31:01,916
I have made such arrangements that...

952
01:31:01,917 --> 01:31:04,290
...both your hearts will
be pleased with it.

953
01:31:04,291 --> 01:31:09,334
Come in and see the fun.

954
01:31:35,041 --> 01:31:39,457
'I'm in your love.'

955
01:31:39,458 --> 01:31:44,625
'I'm in your heart's passion.'

956
01:31:48,208 --> 01:31:52,500
'I got robbed, I got ruined,
I got killed, oh beloved.'

957
01:31:54,458 --> 01:31:58,834
'Don't know what will happen to me? '

958
01:31:59,375 --> 01:32:04,500
'The intoxication of your lips... '

959
01:32:05,041 --> 01:32:09,917
'... I'll definitely taste
it. Oh beautiful! '

960
01:32:42,542 --> 01:32:47,374
'You are my dream.'

961
01:32:47,375 --> 01:32:52,500
'My heart is restless.'

962
01:32:56,041 --> 01:33:00,500
'You are in my heart, my life
and my soul, oh beloved.'

963
01:33:02,208 --> 01:33:06,000
'I have forgotten to count days,
months and years.'

964
01:33:07,041 --> 01:33:12,250
'I swear by God... '

965
01:33:12,958 --> 01:33:17,792
...I'll definitely keep you
in my heart. Oh beautiful! '

966
01:34:04,542 --> 01:34:09,334
Who is there?

967
01:34:59,041 --> 01:35:02,125
Hello! Is Mr. Mahesh Saxena there?
Please give him the phone.

968
01:35:06,375 --> 01:35:09,207
Mahesh, look, someone has barged
into the house in a car.

969
01:35:09,208 --> 01:35:11,124
And he's attacking on me.

970
01:35:11,125 --> 01:35:13,416
Who is he?
- I don't know, Mahesh.

971
01:35:13,417 --> 01:35:15,040
I can't see anything inside.

972
01:35:15,041 --> 01:35:18,083
You write down the car's number.
And call the police.

973
01:35:18,250 --> 01:35:20,416
Yes, I'll do that.
You come here soon.

974
01:35:20,417 --> 01:35:23,833
Come within 15 minutes. Please.
I'm too scared.

975
01:35:23,916 --> 01:35:26,624
All the glasses in the
house are broken.

976
01:35:26,625 --> 01:35:28,624
It's darkness everywhere. Mahesh,
I'm getting sacred.

977
01:35:28,625 --> 01:35:33,583
I'll just come and see who it is.

978
01:35:51,958 --> 01:35:57,499
Hey Rich boy! Does this road
belong to your father?

979
01:35:57,500 --> 01:36:02,375
Move your car.

980
01:36:04,208 --> 01:36:06,249
Hey, start the car.

981
01:36:06,250 --> 01:36:09,040
It seems he's sleeping drunk.
Hey, get out!

982
01:36:09,041 --> 01:36:14,333
Open this. Come out!

983
01:36:29,042 --> 01:36:34,333
The steering is moving.

984
01:36:39,958 --> 01:36:44,667
How come it's moving?

985
01:36:54,958 --> 01:36:59,500
What's happening?

986
01:36:59,958 --> 01:37:03,957
The backside is up.

987
01:37:03,958 --> 01:37:08,667
Someone save me.

988
01:37:15,208 --> 01:37:20,667
The car has opened its
back side. I'm safe.

989
01:37:29,916 --> 01:37:31,915
I'm dead!

990
01:37:31,916 --> 01:37:37,333
It also hits from behind.

991
01:38:12,916 --> 01:38:14,915
Save me!

992
01:38:14,916 --> 01:38:20,291
Some one, save me!

993
01:38:46,917 --> 01:38:48,541
How did you people find
out about this corpse?

994
01:38:48,542 --> 01:38:51,207
Sir, we come here daily
to pray to Lord Hanuman.

995
01:38:51,208 --> 01:38:52,957
Today we saw the corpse
floating in the water...

996
01:38:52,958 --> 01:38:54,957
...so we called up the police.

997
01:38:54,958 --> 01:38:57,041
So this is the funda.

998
01:38:57,042 --> 01:38:59,124
Sitaram, write down
their statements.

999
01:38:59,125 --> 01:39:00,957
Sir, the corpse has swollen
so much due to water...

1000
01:39:00,958 --> 01:39:02,374
...it's very difficult
to recognize his face.

1001
01:39:02,375 --> 01:39:07,750
And we found this wallet in
the coat of the corpse.

1002
01:39:14,083 --> 01:39:16,999
This Mahesh Saxena.
- Do you know him, sir?

1003
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:21,041
I met him at the death ceremony
of Kailash Chopra.

1004
01:39:21,042 --> 01:39:24,082
His wife has given a complaint
that since the 31st...

1005
01:39:24,083 --> 01:39:27,082
...he hasn't returned home.
And she also complained...

1006
01:39:27,083 --> 01:39:31,000
...that same night someone in
car was causing trouble...

1007
01:39:31,083 --> 01:39:34,334
...by making a lot of noise.

1008
01:39:37,250 --> 01:39:42,083
Is it possible that car's funda
is related to this murder?

1009
01:39:44,042 --> 01:39:47,167
Shetty, Mrs. Saxena had
given the car's number.

1010
01:39:48,209 --> 01:39:53,792
Just find out who owns that car.

1011
01:39:57,292 --> 01:39:59,124
Priya, what should we gift
Vicky on his engagement?

1012
01:39:59,125 --> 01:40:03,957
Isn't it enough that
we two are going?

1013
01:40:03,958 --> 01:40:06,041
Come here!

1014
01:40:06,042 --> 01:40:09,333
Me?
- Yes you, come here.

1015
01:40:09,334 --> 01:40:11,041
Sir has been waiting for
you past 15-20 minutes...

1016
01:40:11,042 --> 01:40:13,999
...and you are trying to sneak out?

1017
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:17,333
For me, but why?

1018
01:40:17,334 --> 01:40:19,999
Is this your car?
- Yes.

1019
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:24,125
This is a nice funda. Come.
- Where?

1020
01:40:24,875 --> 01:40:26,916
To the police station.

1021
01:40:26,917 --> 01:40:30,540
Police station? But why, sir?

1022
01:40:30,541 --> 01:40:33,208
Mahesh Saxena!

1023
01:40:33,209 --> 01:40:37,000
Mahesh was murdered last
night between 12 and 1.

1024
01:40:38,541 --> 01:40:40,416
I have doubt that you have
committed the murder.

1025
01:40:40,417 --> 01:40:43,833
Murder? No sir. You must
have made a mistake.

1026
01:40:44,042 --> 01:40:47,249
We'll clear out all the mistakes
at the police station.

1027
01:40:47,250 --> 01:40:50,334
Come with quietly or I'll
drag you from here.

1028
01:41:08,875 --> 01:41:10,291
Inspector, it's the same car.

1029
01:41:10,292 --> 01:41:11,999
Last night this was the
car that had come.

1030
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:13,874
The car belongs to him.

1031
01:41:13,875 --> 01:41:15,374
Was he present in the
car at that time?

1032
01:41:15,375 --> 01:41:16,999
I don't know.

1033
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,083
It was not visible from
my house's window.

1034
01:41:19,084 --> 01:41:22,166
If it's his car then he
should be the murderer.

1035
01:41:22,167 --> 01:41:24,999
Murderer! Killer! I won't
spare you alive.

1036
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,999
What wrong had my husband to
you that you had to kill him?

1037
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,999
Tell me. What enmity did
you have with my husband?

1038
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,208
Constable, take her and make
her sit inside. - Come.

1039
01:41:33,209 --> 01:41:35,166
You sit there. We'll carry
on the investigation.

1040
01:41:35,167 --> 01:41:36,916
Go.
- Come madam.

1041
01:41:36,917 --> 01:41:39,208
I have already told you I don't
know any Mahesh Saxena.

1042
01:41:39,209 --> 01:41:40,540
And I don't know where
is his bungalow...

1043
01:41:40,541 --> 01:41:45,249
Lower your voice! Speak softly.

1044
01:41:45,250 --> 01:41:48,292
If you didn't know his address then
how did your car get there?

1045
01:41:49,375 --> 01:41:51,083
Then how did Mrs. Saxena give...

1046
01:41:51,084 --> 01:41:55,041
...your car number on the phone?
- How should I know?

1047
01:41:55,042 --> 01:41:57,041
He won't agree this way.

1048
01:41:57,042 --> 01:42:02,374
I think we have to explain
to him my funda.

1049
01:42:02,375 --> 01:42:04,083
The tire marks found
at Mahesh Saxena's...

1050
01:42:04,084 --> 01:42:07,041
...murder location were
made from these tires.

1051
01:42:07,042 --> 01:42:10,041
There is one surprise to this.
When Kailash Chopra...

1052
01:42:10,042 --> 01:42:12,874
...was murdered, the same tire
marks are to be found there.

1053
01:42:12,875 --> 01:42:15,333
Here, take this, sir.

1054
01:42:15,334 --> 01:42:18,083
So this is the funda.

1055
01:42:18,084 --> 01:42:21,083
Sir, I think he's a very
big serial killer.

1056
01:42:21,084 --> 01:42:24,292
Now I have to begin this
investigation from A, B,C.

1057
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:29,375
Okay tell me. Why did you
murder Kailash Chopra?

1058
01:42:29,875 --> 01:42:32,083
Kailash Chopra? Who
is Kailash Chopra?

1059
01:42:32,084 --> 01:42:34,999
Really? You don't know
who Kailash Chopra is?

1060
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:38,958
The same guy who you
killed on the 29th...

1061
01:42:39,042 --> 01:42:42,124
...between 3 and 4 near Palghar
railway crossing.

1062
01:42:42,125 --> 01:42:44,208
Inspector, I have killed no one.

1063
01:42:44,209 --> 01:42:47,041
And on 29th I was working
the whole day.

1064
01:42:47,042 --> 01:42:50,041
Where do you work?
- At Karrtar Singh's garage.

1065
01:42:50,042 --> 01:42:52,083
Come here. Take Karrtar
Singh's number from him...

1066
01:42:52,084 --> 01:42:54,374
...and call him here at once.

1067
01:42:54,375 --> 01:42:57,208
Yes, sir.

1068
01:42:57,209 --> 01:42:58,540
What happened, sister-in-law?

1069
01:42:58,541 --> 01:43:01,041
His killer has been caught.

1070
01:43:01,042 --> 01:43:04,916
His name is Raj. He's
also killed Mr. Chopra.

1071
01:43:04,917 --> 01:43:07,374
This is latest news, dad.

1072
01:43:07,375 --> 01:43:12,584
Sister-in-law, you wait here.
I'll be right back.

1073
01:43:12,958 --> 01:43:17,416
So this is the killer who has
murdered my two partners.

1074
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,415
You scoundrel, I won't
spare you alive.

1075
01:43:20,416 --> 01:43:21,999
I'll get you hanged.

1076
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,999
Are you an executioner?
- What rubbish are you saying?

1077
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:25,999
An executioner hangs
everyone to death.

1078
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,083
Wow! This is the latest news.
- What?

1079
01:43:28,084 --> 01:43:29,499
This is strange, dad.
You never told us...

1080
01:43:29,500 --> 01:43:33,874
...that you were also an executioner.

1081
01:43:33,875 --> 01:43:37,332
This is the police station. We
are doing our investigation.

1082
01:43:37,333 --> 01:43:42,875
You go and sit outside.
- Come, Jojo.

1083
01:43:58,250 --> 01:44:00,208
Sardarji, has brought
the whole gang along.

1084
01:44:00,209 --> 01:44:02,457
What is this, son?
- I don't know, uncle...

1085
01:44:02,458 --> 01:44:06,416
Listen Sardarji, do you know
this boy? - Absolutely.

1086
01:44:06,917 --> 01:44:10,290
He's one of my kids. He works
as part time in my garage.

1087
01:44:10,291 --> 01:44:13,333
This boy has committed two murders.
- What?

1088
01:44:13,875 --> 01:44:17,958
The first murder on 29 and the
second one yesterday evening.

1089
01:44:17,959 --> 01:44:24,500
I have called you here to ask if on
the 29th was this boy with you.

1090
01:44:28,209 --> 01:44:30,083
What are you thinking, Sardarji?

1091
01:44:30,084 --> 01:44:33,041
I was thinking that
on what qualities...

1092
01:44:33,042 --> 01:44:36,125
...the government has given you
this uniform. - Sardarji!

1093
01:44:36,333 --> 01:44:38,415
You just look at this boy properly.

1094
01:44:38,416 --> 01:44:41,083
Do you think he must have
committed any murder?

1095
01:44:41,084 --> 01:44:47,458
Sardarji, you just tell me where
this boy was on the 29th.

1096
01:44:47,875 --> 01:44:50,959
Doing my work. I had send him
to one of my customers...

1097
01:44:51,042 --> 01:44:53,916
...to Mr. Singhania
with my towing van.

1098
01:44:53,917 --> 01:44:55,541
Where was his car at that moment?

1099
01:44:55,542 --> 01:44:57,083
When he took the towing
van then no doubt...

1100
01:44:57,084 --> 01:45:00,041
...his car must have
been in the garage.

1101
01:45:00,042 --> 01:45:03,083
And you are talking about yesterday
evening's murder...

1102
01:45:03,084 --> 01:45:06,875
...then we were all with Raj
from 7 to 1 at club 24/7.

1103
01:45:07,042 --> 01:45:09,582
Yes, we were all together.

1104
01:45:09,583 --> 01:45:11,083
And sir, we have also brought
the manager of the club...

1105
01:45:11,084 --> 01:45:13,457
...along with us. If you
want you can ask him to.

1106
01:45:13,458 --> 01:45:16,374
Yes sir. From tomorrow evening
till night he was in my club.

1107
01:45:16,375 --> 01:45:17,916
Now how can you say...

1108
01:45:17,917 --> 01:45:21,457
...that both the murders
were committed by Raj?

1109
01:45:21,458 --> 01:45:25,542
Sir, don't put your hands in the
beehive. I'm getting scared.

1110
01:45:25,917 --> 01:45:29,000
They have more witnesses then
the evidences we have.

1111
01:45:29,458 --> 01:45:31,124
Inspector, if you give
us the permission...

1112
01:45:31,125 --> 01:45:36,584
...then can we take him with us?

1113
01:45:39,042 --> 01:45:41,541
The law also has a concept.

1114
01:45:41,542 --> 01:45:45,166
Either the file is closed
or the criminal is closed.

1115
01:45:47,500 --> 01:45:50,499
But this case is still
open from both sides.

1116
01:45:50,500 --> 01:45:54,041
Shetty, write down their statements.

1117
01:45:54,042 --> 01:45:58,374
And release him for the time being.
- Go out in a queue.

1118
01:45:58,375 --> 01:46:01,415
I can never fill up Mr.
Saxena's place.

1119
01:46:01,416 --> 01:46:03,124
But if you ever need
me then you can...

1120
01:46:03,125 --> 01:46:05,582
...even call me at midnight,
I would come to you.

1121
01:46:05,583 --> 01:46:07,041
This is latest news. What happened?

1122
01:46:07,042 --> 01:46:08,249
The killer is released.

1123
01:46:08,250 --> 01:46:11,083
Don't be worried, pal.
- Worried about what?

1124
01:46:11,084 --> 01:46:12,332
I haven't done anything.
They are forcing...

1125
01:46:12,333 --> 01:46:14,582
...these two murders on me.

1126
01:46:14,583 --> 01:46:16,083
You at least remember
that tomorrow...

1127
01:46:16,084 --> 01:46:17,582
...you two are coming to Poona,
for my engagement.

1128
01:46:17,583 --> 01:46:22,334
Yes, I'll come.

1129
01:46:24,042 --> 01:46:27,084
You have been spared from here.
But I won't spare you.

1130
01:46:34,042 --> 01:46:36,041
This is the latest news.
- What?

1131
01:46:36,042 --> 01:46:41,584
Your face has been blackened.
- Shut up!

1132
01:46:45,291 --> 01:46:47,165
What's the matter? You didn't
call me from many days.

1133
01:46:47,166 --> 01:46:48,374
Is everything okay over there?

1134
01:46:48,375 --> 01:46:50,290
I'm fine, papa. How are you?

1135
01:46:50,291 --> 01:46:52,499
I'm perfectly alright.
Tell me how is Raj?

1136
01:46:52,500 --> 01:46:55,124
He's fine, papa. I'm just
leaving for an engagement...

1137
01:46:55,125 --> 01:46:57,958
...in Poona with him.
- Really?

1138
01:46:57,959 --> 01:47:02,500
Papa, Raj is here.

1139
01:47:11,208 --> 01:47:13,457
Don't waste time on these Hi
and Bye. Get in, quickly.

1140
01:47:13,458 --> 01:47:16,041
Open the door.
- But it's unlocked.

1141
01:47:16,042 --> 01:47:21,334
I have applied henna on my hands.

1142
01:47:34,041 --> 01:47:35,582
Raj, my hairs getting into my eyes.

1143
01:47:35,583 --> 01:47:42,042
Please tie a scarf around it.
- Where's the scarf?

1144
01:48:11,208 --> 01:48:14,040
Raj! - What happened? -

1145
01:48:14,041 --> 01:48:18,332
Just take a look, please.

1146
01:48:18,333 --> 01:48:22,457
Where?
- There.

1147
01:48:22,458 --> 01:48:26,457
Here?
- No, a little lower.

1148
01:48:26,458 --> 01:48:31,457
Here?
- No, further lower

1149
01:48:31,458 --> 01:48:34,916
Here?
- No a little bit on the right.

1150
01:48:34,917 --> 01:48:37,249
Not here, not there.
Not up not down.

1151
01:48:37,250 --> 01:48:39,040
Then where are you feeling itchy?

1152
01:48:39,041 --> 01:48:43,666
A little lower.

1153
01:48:46,041 --> 01:48:49,040
Yes, right there.

1154
01:48:49,041 --> 01:48:54,833
Your hand is just like
itch-guard ointment.

1155
01:48:55,041 --> 01:48:59,666
What are you doing?

1156
01:49:01,208 --> 01:49:07,541
It seems that I have to become
the complete itch-guard.

1157
01:49:14,208 --> 01:49:17,958
Can't you see while driving?

1158
01:49:40,125 --> 01:49:45,334
'Oh beloved! '

1159
01:49:50,375 --> 01:49:54,417
'You have taken away my heart.'

1160
01:50:31,208 --> 01:50:37,500
'There is no one as
adorable as you.'

1161
01:50:43,041 --> 01:50:47,040
'Now I have said it once again.'

1162
01:50:47,041 --> 01:50:52,542
'You call me crazy or
call this craziness.'

1163
01:50:54,041 --> 01:50:58,040
'Oh beloved! '

1164
01:50:58,041 --> 01:51:03,750
'You have taken away my heart.'

1165
01:51:41,125 --> 01:51:44,791
'You don't know in what state my
heart was before meeting you.'

1166
01:51:44,916 --> 01:51:48,208
'I was very Lonely, all by myself.'

1167
01:51:49,375 --> 01:51:52,417
'You have given me the sweet pain.'

1168
01:51:53,041 --> 01:51:56,083
'I got peace but yet
I was restless.'

1169
01:51:59,041 --> 01:52:04,542
'Even I got crazy, for you.'

1170
01:52:06,041 --> 01:52:10,040
'Without you I can't live.'

1171
01:52:10,041 --> 01:52:13,999
'Now I have said it once again.'

1172
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:19,791
'You call me crazy or
call this craziness.'

1173
01:52:21,167 --> 01:52:25,082
'Oh beloved! '

1174
01:52:25,083 --> 01:52:30,875
'You have taken away my heart.'

1175
01:52:47,041 --> 01:52:50,459
'Your craziness has such a trance.'

1176
01:52:51,041 --> 01:52:54,333
'No matter what, but
I must have it.'

1177
01:52:55,208 --> 01:52:59,040
'Hiding you in my heartbeats.'

1178
01:52:59,041 --> 01:53:02,083
'I'll take you away from you.'

1179
01:53:02,250 --> 01:53:10,417
'My heart has confirmed the
deal with your heart.'

1180
01:53:11,958 --> 01:53:15,957
'Your love has murdered me.'

1181
01:53:15,958 --> 01:53:19,999
'Now I have said it once again.'

1182
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:25,791
'You call me crazy or
call this craziness.'

1183
01:53:27,083 --> 01:53:31,082
'Oh beloved! '

1184
01:53:31,083 --> 01:53:36,667
'You have taken away my heart.'

1185
01:54:04,375 --> 01:54:05,915
Raj, that was good that
you braked on time...

1186
01:54:05,916 --> 01:54:07,249
...or else we would had an accident.

1187
01:54:07,250 --> 01:54:12,041
Hey Michael Schumacher!

1188
01:54:12,042 --> 01:54:15,375
Wow, what a lovely car!
- Thank you, uncle.

1189
01:54:16,125 --> 01:54:19,750
What thank you? Didn't you see
there's a long queue of cars?

1190
01:54:21,875 --> 01:54:23,207
Oh God! Such a big queue?

1191
01:54:23,208 --> 01:54:25,041
What else! We crawled for
3 and a half hours...

1192
01:54:25,042 --> 01:54:27,874
...and then we reached here.
And you just...

1193
01:54:27,875 --> 01:54:30,291
...barged in like Formula-1 racing.

1194
01:54:30,292 --> 01:54:31,999
Hey, what's happening there?

1195
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,207
Constable, this car owner
just barged in the queue.

1196
01:54:34,208 --> 01:54:35,499
Who is barged into whom?

1197
01:54:35,500 --> 01:54:37,874
He came from behind like this
and barged in like this.

1198
01:54:37,875 --> 01:54:39,874
He came like this and
barged like this.

1199
01:54:39,875 --> 01:54:41,207
Have you gone nuts?

1200
01:54:41,208 --> 01:54:43,874
Is this car some crab, that
can walk on its sides?

1201
01:54:43,875 --> 01:54:45,499
How can he barge in
such a small space?

1202
01:54:45,500 --> 01:54:47,999
He must be waiting too
long in the queue.

1203
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:51,999
Hey truck driver, take
the truck ahead.

1204
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:56,792
C'mon, keep moving ahead.

1205
01:55:00,042 --> 01:55:04,875
Hey, bring it forward.

1206
01:55:07,250 --> 01:55:11,041
It's a nice car. Is it imported?

1207
01:55:11,042 --> 01:55:12,416
No sir, I have built it myself.

1208
01:55:12,417 --> 01:55:16,458
So, you have built it.
C'mon get out.

1209
01:55:16,459 --> 01:55:19,041
Heroin is transported in such cars.

1210
01:55:19,042 --> 01:55:20,916
Sir, which heroine
has been kidnapped?

1211
01:55:20,917 --> 01:55:24,041
I'm not talking about heroine
but heroin. Drugs!

1212
01:55:24,042 --> 01:55:26,249
C'mon, open the trunk of the car.
- No sir, there's nothing in it.

1213
01:55:26,250 --> 01:55:29,624
All say the same thing. I
feel this car is trouble.

1214
01:55:29,625 --> 01:55:34,500
C'mon, open the trunk of the car.

1215
01:55:34,500 --> 01:55:39,041
Not the glass, open the trunk.
- I'm doing the same, sir.

1216
01:55:39,042 --> 01:55:42,167
Sir, I'll check.
- No, I'll check.

1217
01:55:49,208 --> 01:55:55,042
Get me out!
- Sir, wait! Pull!

1218
01:56:00,500 --> 01:56:06,667
Don't pull me. Open the trunk.

1219
01:56:07,666 --> 01:56:11,292
I'm dead! What's happening?
It's too much of pain.

1220
01:56:12,042 --> 01:56:16,582
C'mon, take your car and get out.
- Get lost.

1221
01:56:16,583 --> 01:56:18,208
Call for the doctor.
- Yes.

1222
01:56:18,209 --> 01:56:23,667
Take this omen car away from here.
- Go away.

1223
01:56:27,042 --> 01:56:28,916
Sir, did you get hurt?

1224
01:56:28,917 --> 01:56:31,333
Shut up! First tell
me who pulled my leg?

1225
01:56:31,334 --> 01:56:32,416
I didn't pull it.
- Nor did I pull it.

1226
01:56:32,417 --> 01:56:36,874
Then who pulled it.

1227
01:56:36,875 --> 01:56:42,542
Here comes the slow poke.
- Finally?

1228
01:56:48,209 --> 01:56:49,957
Do you know there was too much
of checking on the highway.

1229
01:56:49,958 --> 01:56:55,375
There was long queue.
- You forget all that and get ready.

1230
01:57:33,209 --> 01:57:37,000
That nuisance car jammed my neck
just like a rusted steering.

1231
01:57:42,375 --> 01:57:48,500
Hey, from where did this come?

1232
01:57:49,958 --> 01:57:54,957
You dare to dash a policeman's jeep!

1233
01:57:54,958 --> 01:58:00,500
Where did go? It just vanished
in to thin air!

1234
01:58:03,958 --> 01:58:08,916
Hey, have you gone nuts?

1235
01:58:18,917 --> 01:58:22,458
You have messed with me! Now,
I won't leave you.

1236
01:58:28,541 --> 01:58:30,916
Get out from the car.

1237
01:58:30,917 --> 01:58:35,540
Get out from the car or else I'll
kill you in an encounter.

1238
01:58:35,541 --> 01:58:39,249
You try to intimidate me!

1239
01:58:39,250 --> 01:58:42,374
You try to intimidate an
policeman and run showing your back.

1240
01:58:42,375 --> 01:58:45,916
Hey, stop! I insist
that you stop. Stop!

1241
01:58:45,917 --> 01:58:48,374
Hey, will you stop?

1242
01:58:48,375 --> 01:58:51,916
I'll break all your
bones. Hey, stop!

1243
01:58:51,917 --> 01:58:55,375
Are you a man or an animal?
Stop, man. Stop!

1244
01:58:55,458 --> 01:59:00,750
You bastard! Why doesn't it stop?

1245
01:59:04,209 --> 01:59:05,957
You started running again.

1246
01:59:05,958 --> 01:59:10,041
You dare to make a policeman
run after you!

1247
01:59:10,042 --> 01:59:12,208
You make a heavy man like me to run.

1248
01:59:12,209 --> 01:59:14,374
Just let me get hold of
you. I'll kill you...

1249
01:59:14,375 --> 01:59:20,292
...just like a bug is pulled out
from the chair and smashed.

1250
01:59:27,333 --> 01:59:30,792
When I fired in the air one time...
...you came to your senses!

1251
01:59:30,917 --> 01:59:35,667
Now, get out from here.

1252
01:59:39,250 --> 01:59:43,167
Goodness me! There's no one in here.

1253
01:59:57,917 --> 02:00:00,374
Hey, this car is moving
without a driver.

1254
02:00:00,375 --> 02:00:04,250
Hey, what are you doing? Why are
you making me run backwards?

1255
02:00:04,375 --> 02:00:07,874
Let me see, what's behind. You
make a policeman run backwards.

1256
02:00:07,875 --> 02:00:12,166
Hey, you'll hurt me! You'll
hurt me. What are you doing?

1257
02:00:12,167 --> 02:00:14,874
I can't even see, what's
going on behind.

1258
02:00:14,875 --> 02:00:19,417
Stop, at once!

1259
02:00:32,917 --> 02:00:35,959
Hey, you all don't move from here.
Or else, I'll become the scapegoat.

1260
02:01:20,167 --> 02:01:25,625
Run from here. Run! Run
from here, quickly.

1261
02:01:27,875 --> 02:01:29,207
Hey, where's the key, man?

1262
02:01:29,208 --> 02:01:31,999
It seems it got lost when
the jeep overturned.

1263
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,166
What will I do, now? I'll sneak
in through the garage.

1264
02:01:34,167 --> 02:01:39,459
I'll get in through the garage.

1265
02:01:54,208 --> 02:01:57,333
Goodness me! This reached here, too!

1266
02:03:00,917 --> 02:03:02,415
C'mon. Fast! Fast!

1267
02:03:02,416 --> 02:03:05,207
Hello, headquarters. This
is Vijay. I mean Ajay.

1268
02:03:05,208 --> 02:03:08,250
I forgot my own name. I'm
inspector Sanjay Sharma.

1269
02:03:08,375 --> 02:03:11,374
A Mumbai car is hell-bent
on taking my life.

1270
02:03:11,375 --> 02:03:15,250
The number of that
car is MH-01-M-37.

1271
02:03:15,458 --> 02:03:21,250
And the most startling
fact is that the car...

1272
02:03:41,208 --> 02:03:44,207
Now, we want to hear
good news from you.

1273
02:03:44,208 --> 02:03:47,916
From us?
- Or else, from whom?

1274
02:03:47,917 --> 02:03:53,292
Thanks for coming, buddy.

1275
02:03:59,208 --> 02:04:00,416
What is this inspector?

1276
02:04:00,417 --> 02:04:03,416
Anyone is being killed!
Anyone is being murdered!

1277
02:04:03,417 --> 02:04:05,249
Not anyone, Mr. D'costa.

1278
02:04:05,250 --> 02:04:07,249
Only those people are being killed...

1279
02:04:07,250 --> 02:04:09,290
...whose funda is related to you.

1280
02:04:09,291 --> 02:04:12,750
Mr. Sharma and Mr. Chopra
were both your partners.

1281
02:04:12,875 --> 02:04:15,874
After investigation it has been
revealed that even inspector...

1282
02:04:15,875 --> 02:04:18,249
...Sanjay Sharma had an old
connection with you.

1283
02:04:18,250 --> 02:04:19,416
This is the latest news.

1284
02:04:19,417 --> 02:04:21,374
This means that dad is
fourth on the list.

1285
02:04:21,375 --> 02:04:23,416
Shut up! What nonsense
are you talking?

1286
02:04:23,417 --> 02:04:26,874
Mr. D'costa, he's right.

1287
02:04:26,875 --> 02:04:29,207
The way in which your mates
have been murdered...

1288
02:04:29,208 --> 02:04:31,416
...it seems that even you
can be on the hit list.

1289
02:04:31,417 --> 02:04:34,416
That's why, I'd suggest you
to take police protection.

1290
02:04:34,417 --> 02:04:36,874
Yes, Mr. D'costa. Take
police protection.

1291
02:04:36,875 --> 02:04:39,374
Or else you'll die a vague death.
- Good gracious!

1292
02:04:39,375 --> 02:04:42,207
Because that car runs over
you and breaks your bones.

1293
02:04:42,208 --> 02:04:44,416
And bones don't get
joined in old age.

1294
02:04:44,417 --> 02:04:45,624
He gives you such a death...

1295
02:04:45,625 --> 02:04:47,541
...that any witness gets
frightened to death!

1296
02:04:47,542 --> 02:04:50,874
No! No, inspector,
please save my dad.

1297
02:04:50,875 --> 02:04:53,290
There's no one for me in
this world besides him.

1298
02:04:53,291 --> 02:04:55,416
Dad, please don't go away
leaving me alone.

1299
02:04:55,417 --> 02:04:58,207
I'll become an orphan, dad.

1300
02:04:58,208 --> 02:05:01,916
Shut up! I'm still alive.

1301
02:05:01,917 --> 02:05:03,916
Why don't you arrest
the killer instead...

1302
02:05:03,917 --> 02:05:05,416
...of giving me protection?

1303
02:05:05,417 --> 02:05:07,207
This is the funda.

1304
02:05:07,208 --> 02:05:10,834
I don't have any evidence to
prove that Raj is the killer.

1305
02:05:11,208 --> 02:05:13,916
I can't give you anything
except protection.

1306
02:05:13,917 --> 02:05:17,500
Whenever you need the
police you can call me.

1307
02:05:18,917 --> 02:05:24,500
Stay indoors. Don't venture
out in the open.

1308
02:05:25,917 --> 02:05:28,124
Jojo, you always frighten me.

1309
02:05:28,125 --> 02:05:30,124
I get scared, seeing you get scared.

1310
02:05:30,125 --> 02:05:32,124
No, dad. I get scared,
seeing you get scared.

1311
02:05:32,125 --> 02:05:34,332
All right then. We'll
not get scared anymore.

1312
02:05:34,333 --> 02:05:39,334
We'll fight back with courage.

1313
02:05:40,041 --> 02:05:42,124
Dad, he's come?
- Who?

1314
02:05:42,125 --> 02:05:45,957
Your killer!
- Killer? - Yes.

1315
02:05:45,958 --> 02:05:48,040
Hey dad, wait for me.

1316
02:05:48,041 --> 02:05:51,417
Hey, monkey. Down. Let
me close it. It's done.

1317
02:05:55,208 --> 02:05:57,957
Why are you closing the door?

1318
02:05:57,958 --> 02:05:59,207
Where should I hide?

1319
02:05:59,208 --> 02:06:02,957
Hey, fool! You left
me stranded there!

1320
02:06:02,958 --> 02:06:05,374
What, dad?
- Yes. - You made such a big house.

1321
02:06:05,375 --> 02:06:07,207
You didn't even make at
least one place to hide.

1322
02:06:07,208 --> 02:06:08,916
Now, when that killer
is coming to kill you...

1323
02:06:08,917 --> 02:06:10,916
...then, where shall I hide?

1324
02:06:10,917 --> 02:06:14,500
Fool! He's coming to kill
me and you are hiding.

1325
02:06:14,917 --> 02:06:17,082
Go. If you are really my son...
- No!

1326
02:06:17,083 --> 02:06:19,915
...then go and finish the enemy.

1327
02:06:19,916 --> 02:06:25,207
Go. Go, you worthless fellow.

1328
02:06:25,208 --> 02:06:28,875
Oh God, where shall I hide
now? Shall I hide here?

1329
02:06:33,458 --> 02:06:38,334
He's come!

1330
02:06:45,208 --> 02:06:47,957
It seems that dad's mouth
has been gagged.

1331
02:06:47,958 --> 02:06:53,750
I must find another
way to go inside.

1332
02:07:12,041 --> 02:07:15,958
The killer has come. Please save me.

1333
02:07:16,083 --> 02:07:18,082
Please don't kill me. Don't kill me.

1334
02:07:18,083 --> 02:07:20,082
I'll die.
- Dad, it's me.

1335
02:07:20,083 --> 02:07:23,040
Don't kill me!
- Dad, it's me, Jojo.

1336
02:07:23,041 --> 02:07:25,416
It's you!
- Yes. Here's the latest news.

1337
02:07:25,417 --> 02:07:28,249
The car that we got frightened
of was our own car.

1338
02:07:28,250 --> 02:07:32,000
The mechanic had come to deliver
it. You, son of a donkey!

1339
02:07:33,208 --> 02:07:34,915
What was the need to break
the window pane...

1340
02:07:34,916 --> 02:07:36,915
...and come inside for that?

1341
02:07:36,916 --> 02:07:39,541
I banged against the door. But
you didn't open the door.

1342
02:07:39,542 --> 02:07:41,332
I thought that you'd
get a heart attack.

1343
02:07:41,333 --> 02:07:42,915
That's why I entered
through the window.

1344
02:07:42,916 --> 02:07:44,416
Your entry through the window...

1345
02:07:44,417 --> 02:07:46,499
...was itself a big heart
attack for me.

1346
02:07:46,500 --> 02:07:48,957
My heart was in my mouth.
If it had been big enough...

1347
02:07:48,958 --> 02:07:50,457
...then it would have come out.

1348
02:07:50,458 --> 02:07:54,541
This is the latest news.
- Shut up.

1349
02:07:54,542 --> 02:07:57,457
Now, I'll leave for Nagpur for
some days, tomorrow itself.

1350
02:07:57,458 --> 02:07:59,541
So that the killer doesn't
get to know about me.

1351
02:07:59,542 --> 02:08:01,457
Or else that killer will
kill me afterwards...

1352
02:08:01,458 --> 02:08:05,167
...but this worthless fellow
will kill me first. Donkey!

1353
02:08:05,458 --> 02:08:08,166
I'm tired of being called
as donkey and worthless.

1354
02:08:08,167 --> 02:08:10,416
Just see now. I'll prove it to you.

1355
02:08:10,417 --> 02:08:15,667
That I'm quite intelligent.

1356
02:08:27,208 --> 02:08:31,915
No, he's being just engaged...
- Raj, you've a call.

1357
02:08:31,916 --> 02:08:34,332
Hello, who is it?
- Your well-wisher.

1358
02:08:34,333 --> 02:08:39,333
Well-wisher? - Yes, I had
called you to give a tip.

1359
02:08:39,417 --> 02:08:42,833
Which tip? - The fourth partner
of the three people...

1360
02:08:42,916 --> 02:08:46,833
...that you've killed, Mr.
Anthony D'costa, is going...

1361
02:08:46,916 --> 02:08:49,915
...for a business meeting in Nagpur.

1362
02:08:49,916 --> 02:08:51,915
You've a really golden opportunity.

1363
02:08:51,916 --> 02:08:57,957
Finish him off between
Mumbai and Nagpur.

1364
02:08:57,958 --> 02:08:59,374
This is the latest news.

1365
02:08:59,375 --> 02:09:02,374
He takes the right message
and says it's wrong number.

1366
02:09:02,375 --> 02:09:05,500
Boss, what should we do now?
- My plan has become successful.

1367
02:09:05,958 --> 02:09:08,166
He got the tip.

1368
02:09:08,167 --> 02:09:11,874
In a few time from now he'll
set off to kill dad.

1369
02:09:11,875 --> 02:09:14,332
We'll follow him.

1370
02:09:14,333 --> 02:09:18,292
Before he finishes dad,
we'll finish him off!

1371
02:09:20,875 --> 02:09:22,332
I've escaped.

1372
02:09:22,333 --> 02:09:25,082
Man, I escaped from
my worthless son...

1373
02:09:25,083 --> 02:09:30,625
. and I've escaped from
that killer too.

1374
02:09:31,041 --> 02:09:32,915
You always considered
me as your worthless...

1375
02:09:32,916 --> 02:09:34,541
...and good for nothing son.

1376
02:09:34,542 --> 02:09:38,000
There's no need to consider that.
You were in fact born as worthless.

1377
02:09:38,083 --> 02:09:40,082
But from now on, your
misunderstanding...

1378
02:09:40,083 --> 02:09:42,040
...will be gone forever.

1379
02:09:42,041 --> 02:09:43,999
You are Raj's fourth target.

1380
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:47,167
I'll prevent you from
being murdered.

1381
02:09:47,250 --> 02:09:49,541
But, that will only happen if
the killer comes to know of it.

1382
02:09:49,542 --> 02:09:53,333
Dad, I've told your killer Raj
that you're going to Nagpur.

1383
02:09:54,208 --> 02:09:57,207
What?

1384
02:09:57,208 --> 02:10:01,000
He'll try to attack you and
I'll catch him red-handed.

1385
02:10:01,125 --> 02:10:04,041
Hey, you donkey! Are you going
to get your father killed!

1386
02:10:04,042 --> 02:10:06,541
I have not told him
that you are my dad.

1387
02:10:06,542 --> 02:10:10,207
Well done! You are
really not my son.

1388
02:10:10,208 --> 02:10:13,833
This is the latest news.
- I'll give you the latest news.

1389
02:10:13,958 --> 02:10:17,375
If I escape alive, then you'll
not escape alive from me.

1390
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:22,791
Oh God! What son have you given me!

1391
02:10:23,167 --> 02:10:26,166
Now, what shall I do?

1392
02:10:26,167 --> 02:10:29,791
If I go back to Mumbai, then
he'll kill me from the front.

1393
02:10:29,916 --> 02:10:32,082
If I go to Nagpur, then he'll
kill me from behind.

1394
02:10:32,083 --> 02:10:33,915
Now where shall I go?
Where shall I hide?

1395
02:10:33,916 --> 02:10:38,207
I'm confused about what I should do?

1396
02:10:38,208 --> 02:10:42,458
Hey, these are tribal hutments.

1397
02:10:42,459 --> 02:10:46,000
Tonight I'll have booze
and sleep here.

1398
02:10:46,208 --> 02:10:51,834
Let it happen, whatever happens?
I'll deal with it.

1399
02:10:55,916 --> 02:11:00,374
The hutment is shaking.

1400
02:11:00,375 --> 02:11:04,915
It started moving now.

1401
02:11:04,916 --> 02:11:11,000
Goodness me! Why is
this following me?

1402
02:11:13,875 --> 02:11:19,291
Let me run from here.

1403
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:25,625
Hey! This hutment is following me.

1404
02:11:40,916 --> 02:11:44,334
My God! How did this hutment
get on my car?

1405
02:12:00,208 --> 02:12:05,834
You dare to get on my car!
Dare to get over me?

1406
02:12:08,958 --> 02:12:14,417
The... the killer's car!

1407
02:12:14,875 --> 02:12:17,874
There's no one in the car!
How's this possible!?

1408
02:12:17,875 --> 02:12:19,874
Who's driving the car, then?

1409
02:12:19,875 --> 02:12:26,291
Goodness me! How can I stop it?

1410
02:12:32,167 --> 02:12:33,874
No idea, who called.

1411
02:12:33,875 --> 02:12:39,458
Raj has come. Let's hide quickly.

1412
02:12:40,875 --> 02:12:43,124
Priya!
- Yes. My car is not to be seen.

1413
02:12:43,125 --> 02:12:46,167
What!? Where had you parked it?
- There, in front of the white car.

1414
02:12:46,334 --> 02:12:48,249
Oh God, Priya! If something
happens this time...

1415
02:12:48,250 --> 02:12:50,249
...then all the blame
will come on me.

1416
02:12:50,250 --> 02:12:52,416
I must go and write a complaint
in the police station.

1417
02:12:52,417 --> 02:12:54,416
Or else inspector Khurana will
not let me go free this time.

1418
02:12:54,417 --> 02:12:59,333
Then, let's go in my car.

1419
02:13:03,541 --> 02:13:09,500
Thank goodness! That the
car stopped following me.

1420
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:30,041
I had told him to go towards
Nagpur and follow dad.

1421
02:13:30,042 --> 02:13:35,458
Why did he come to
the police station?

1422
02:13:42,167 --> 02:13:47,458
Good gracious! Its back!

1423
02:14:01,209 --> 02:14:06,667
The car stopped because of the kid.

1424
02:14:08,875 --> 02:14:12,167
Come. You want to kill
me, right? Come.

1425
02:14:12,958 --> 02:14:15,874
Run over my body. Come.

1426
02:14:15,875 --> 02:14:20,583
Kill me!

1427
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,082
So, this is the funda.
- Yes, sir.

1428
02:14:34,083 --> 02:14:35,208
What do you think?

1429
02:14:35,209 --> 02:14:38,458
Who must have phoned you
to kill Anthony D'costa?

1430
02:14:38,541 --> 02:14:41,999
I don't know.

1431
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,041
I'm Anthony D'costa here.

1432
02:14:44,042 --> 02:14:46,124
Yes, Mr. D'costa. Tell me.

1433
02:14:46,125 --> 02:14:50,167
Inspector, please save me.
Raj's car wants to kill me.

1434
02:14:50,292 --> 02:14:52,083
But, Raj is sitting
here in front of me.

1435
02:14:52,084 --> 02:14:55,041
How can this be possible? Check
properly, who is in the car?

1436
02:14:55,042 --> 02:14:56,333
He is my death.

1437
02:14:56,334 --> 02:14:59,208
I've no idea who is driving it
and how is it being driven!

1438
02:14:59,209 --> 02:15:00,540
From, where are you talking?

1439
02:15:00,541 --> 02:15:03,792
Inspector, that car is coming.
It's coming towards me.

1440
02:15:03,917 --> 02:15:06,333
Hello Mr. D'costa, tell
me. Where are you?

1441
02:15:06,334 --> 02:15:12,792
Inspector, please save
me. Please save me.

1442
02:15:16,209 --> 02:15:17,916
What happened, sir?

1443
02:15:17,917 --> 02:15:23,667
Someone killed Anthony D'costa.

1444
02:15:24,375 --> 02:15:25,540
Don't know who is that person...

1445
02:15:25,541 --> 02:15:27,916
...who drives the car time
and again and kills people.

1446
02:15:27,917 --> 02:15:29,916
And why does he want all
the blame to fall on me?

1447
02:15:29,917 --> 02:15:32,540
No idea, where's Tarzan right now?

1448
02:15:32,541 --> 02:15:34,916
I fear that a mishap
is going to happen.

1449
02:15:34,917 --> 02:15:37,499
Don't worry, Raj. When the
police have sealed...

1450
02:15:37,500 --> 02:15:40,208
...all the exits then Tarzan
certainly will be found.

1451
02:15:40,209 --> 02:15:43,957
And it may happen that the
person is caught, too.

1452
02:15:43,958 --> 02:15:48,875
Now, let me drop you home.

1453
02:16:10,917 --> 02:16:16,500
Can I talk to inspector Khurana?

1454
02:16:22,209 --> 02:16:27,000
So, when you came here, then this
car was already here? - Yes.

1455
02:16:28,042 --> 02:16:32,167
Does a computer drive this car?
- No.

1456
02:16:32,917 --> 02:16:37,333
Then does a robot drive this?
- Sir, what are you talking?

1457
02:16:37,416 --> 02:16:40,541
Then, what's the funda?
How did the car get here?

1458
02:16:41,959 --> 02:16:44,958
Mother, you were here previously.

1459
02:16:44,959 --> 02:16:48,000
Can you tell us something?
- No. I don't know.

1460
02:16:48,125 --> 02:16:50,208
You don't know.

1461
02:16:50,209 --> 02:16:51,958
While you were writing a complaint...

1462
02:16:51,959 --> 02:16:53,958
...that your car has been stolen,
right at that time...

1463
02:16:53,959 --> 02:16:55,958
...someone bumped Anthony D'costa...

1464
02:16:55,959 --> 02:16:59,000
...along with the telephone
booth, with your car.

1465
02:16:59,375 --> 02:17:01,958
And this car reached
its owner's house...

1466
02:17:01,959 --> 02:17:05,917
...just like a faithful dog.
What does this mean?

1467
02:17:06,042 --> 02:17:08,374
Sir, how can I tell you that?
I was with you at that time.

1468
02:17:08,375 --> 02:17:11,208
I'll tell you the real funda.
You give this car...

1469
02:17:11,209 --> 02:17:14,208
...to someone else and
make him do the murders

1470
02:17:14,209 --> 02:17:16,916
How can you say this? When you
don't have any evidence...

1471
02:17:16,917 --> 02:17:19,374
...against my grandson?

1472
02:17:19,375 --> 02:17:21,249
Will you believe it, if
someone tells you...

1473
02:17:21,250 --> 02:17:24,208
...that this car did
all the accidents?

1474
02:17:24,209 --> 02:17:28,042
I say that your jeep did
all the four murders.

1475
02:17:28,125 --> 02:17:31,374
What nonsense are you talking?
- I'm talking nonsense?

1476
02:17:31,375 --> 02:17:34,374
You say that this car bumped
off the telephone booth.

1477
02:17:34,375 --> 02:17:36,916
Do you see any scratches on it?

1478
02:17:36,917 --> 02:17:39,083
Well, even if a truck bumps
off a telephone booth...

1479
02:17:39,084 --> 02:17:40,999
...even it's bound to suffer damages.

1480
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,041
You are a senior officer and...

1481
02:17:43,042 --> 02:17:45,124
...you don't have the brains
to understand this?

1482
02:17:45,125 --> 02:17:47,208
You've been talking fundas
since a long time.

1483
02:17:47,209 --> 02:17:49,540
My grandson himself phoned
and called you here.

1484
02:17:49,541 --> 02:17:52,290
And conversely, you are blaming him.

1485
02:17:52,291 --> 02:17:55,208
Now I'll take this car
to the commissioner...

1486
02:17:55,209 --> 02:17:57,374
...and ask him personally, whether
do you feel this car...

1487
02:17:57,375 --> 02:17:59,290
...has dashed a telephone booth?

1488
02:17:59,291 --> 02:18:01,166
You'll go to the commissioner?

1489
02:18:01,167 --> 02:18:04,207
If circumstances force me then
I'll even meet the home minister

1490
02:18:04,208 --> 02:18:07,583
Sir, it seems that our end is near.

1491
02:18:07,875 --> 02:18:09,874
Before this lady calls the
home minister to her home...

1492
02:18:09,875 --> 02:18:11,874
...and endangers our home...

1493
02:18:11,875 --> 02:18:17,791
...let's go to our home.

1494
02:18:22,208 --> 02:18:25,291
Mother, you better talk
about your influence...

1495
02:18:25,416 --> 02:18:28,499
...till the commissioner, home
minister and the top...

1496
02:18:28,500 --> 02:18:33,208
...to those officers whose earnings
depend upon the top.

1497
02:18:33,917 --> 02:18:37,916
Not with an officer like me.

1498
02:18:37,917 --> 02:18:42,333
And about this car. This car
is related to every murder.

1499
02:18:42,542 --> 02:18:44,916
I take this car in to
custody, right now.

1500
02:18:44,917 --> 02:18:46,499
Sitaram, bring the ropes.
- Yes, sir.

1501
02:18:46,500 --> 02:18:49,041
And tie this car to the jeep.

1502
02:18:49,042 --> 02:18:52,207
Please sir, don't take
this car away from me.

1503
02:18:52,208 --> 02:18:54,916
This is my father's last souvenir.

1504
02:18:54,917 --> 02:18:57,958
Sir, I promise you that
this car will never...

1505
02:18:57,959 --> 02:19:02,958
...create a mishap or an accident.

1506
02:19:02,959 --> 02:19:05,958
And what if it happens?
- Then I'm responsible for that.

1507
02:19:05,959 --> 02:19:08,874
You can arrest me.

1508
02:19:08,875 --> 02:19:14,291
Think again. This time I'll
not charge you with four...

1509
02:19:14,375 --> 02:19:17,959
...but five murders. That time I'll
not take this car in to custody.

1510
02:19:18,166 --> 02:19:20,207
I'll crush this car
like a matchbox...

1511
02:19:20,208 --> 02:19:22,207
...and throw it in some corner.

1512
02:19:22,208 --> 02:19:26,833
Did you get me?

1513
02:19:45,042 --> 02:19:47,249
What are you doing, son?

1514
02:19:47,250 --> 02:19:51,000
Granny, when I made Tarzan I
felt like papa is with me.

1515
02:19:51,917 --> 02:19:53,916
If Tarzan goes away from me...

1516
02:19:53,917 --> 02:19:59,375
...I'll feel that papa has gone too.

1517
02:20:43,917 --> 02:20:49,207
'My car.'

1518
02:20:49,208 --> 02:20:52,916
'My car.'

1519
02:20:52,917 --> 02:20:57,834
'Tarzan.'

1520
02:21:11,875 --> 02:21:13,040
What a pleasant surprise, papa?

1521
02:21:13,041 --> 02:21:14,165
But, you were supposed
to come tomorrow.

1522
02:21:14,166 --> 02:21:15,958
Why? Don't you like surprises?

1523
02:21:15,959 --> 02:21:17,541
Of course, I like them.

1524
02:21:17,542 --> 02:21:20,040
First tell me, how's Raj?
- He's very good, papa.

1525
02:21:20,041 --> 02:21:22,165
That's fantastic! Do one thing.

1526
02:21:22,166 --> 02:21:24,207
When you go to college
today, tell Raj...

1527
02:21:24,208 --> 02:21:29,040
...that I'll come to meet him
at his house in the evening.

1528
02:21:29,041 --> 02:21:32,458
And till that time, I'll meet
my old friends. Is that Ok?

1529
02:21:44,208 --> 02:21:46,916
How are you? And why is the
security all around here?

1530
02:21:46,917 --> 02:21:49,332
Kapoor uncle, you are still alive?

1531
02:21:49,333 --> 02:21:51,916
Hey, I'm absolutely fit and fine.

1532
02:21:51,917 --> 02:21:53,916
Tell me where's my friend Anthony.

1533
02:21:53,917 --> 02:21:55,999
Don't you know that dad went
along with Chopra uncle...

1534
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:57,916
...Saxena uncle and inspector Sharma?

1535
02:21:57,917 --> 02:21:59,165
But, where did they go?

1536
02:21:59,166 --> 02:22:01,082
Did they go to some hill
station for picnic?

1537
02:22:01,083 --> 02:22:02,457
Then, tell me. I'll
go and meet them.

1538
02:22:02,458 --> 02:22:03,582
Well it's Priya's engagement...

1539
02:22:03,583 --> 02:22:05,916
...and I came to personally
invite them.

1540
02:22:05,917 --> 02:22:08,874
If you want to invite
them personally...

1541
02:22:08,875 --> 02:22:10,874
...then you've to go up.
- What?

1542
02:22:10,875 --> 02:22:15,583
Come. I'll tell you.

1543
02:22:16,875 --> 02:22:20,958
These... - These three have
been murdered. - What?

1544
02:22:21,041 --> 02:22:23,165
Dad was run over and
killed by a car.

1545
02:22:23,166 --> 02:22:24,374
And police said that the same car...

1546
02:22:24,375 --> 02:22:26,957
...had killed Chopra uncle
and Saxena uncle.

1547
02:22:26,958 --> 02:22:29,165
Has the murderer been found?

1548
02:22:29,166 --> 02:22:30,874
The police are still
searching for him.

1549
02:22:30,875 --> 02:22:33,958
And the car with which, they
were killed belongs...

1550
02:22:34,041 --> 02:22:40,292
...to an automobile engineer
Deven Chaudhary's son.

1551
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,416
Yes. Police doubt that
that guy killed them...

1552
02:22:44,417 --> 02:22:46,916
...or made someone kill them.

1553
02:22:46,917 --> 02:22:49,999
Uncle, If he comes to
know that you've come...

1554
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,916
...and you are their partner, then...

1555
02:22:52,917 --> 02:22:54,999
...you won't require to get a
London visa on your passport.

1556
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:58,166
You'll die standing there and
your passport will get expired.

1557
02:23:03,916 --> 02:23:07,333
Uncle, what are you thinking?
- No... nothing.

1558
02:23:07,417 --> 02:23:09,874
I'll look in to this after
Priya's engagement.

1559
02:23:09,875 --> 02:23:13,625
You don't worry.

1560
02:23:14,041 --> 02:23:16,915
This is the latest news.
Why should I worry?

1561
02:23:16,916 --> 02:23:21,583
My dad's already dead.

1562
02:23:37,875 --> 02:23:41,874
Papa, this is Raj.

1563
02:23:41,875 --> 02:23:44,874
No, my son. A son-in-law
is just like a son.

1564
02:23:44,875 --> 02:23:48,915
And a son gives a hug. C'mon.

1565
02:23:48,916 --> 02:23:51,915
Granny, this is Priya's father.
And this is my granny.

1566
02:23:51,916 --> 02:23:53,082
Greetings!
- Greetings!

1567
02:23:53,083 --> 02:23:56,915
Please come in.
- Yes. - Have a seat.

1568
02:23:56,916 --> 02:23:59,915
I'm happy that you came here.

1569
02:23:59,916 --> 02:24:03,083
Priya always talks
about you on phone.

1570
02:24:03,208 --> 02:24:07,834
She tells that whenever I
meet granny I forget you.

1571
02:24:10,916 --> 02:24:13,207
...is going to become the
daughter-in-law of your house.

1572
02:24:13,208 --> 02:24:15,874
This is your greatness and...

1573
02:24:15,875 --> 02:24:17,874
...honestly speaking, this
is our good fortune.

1574
02:24:17,875 --> 02:24:20,040
Thank you.
- I'll bring tea for you.

1575
02:24:20,041 --> 02:24:24,917
Fine.

1576
02:24:35,875 --> 02:24:39,125
Uncle, that my father's photo.

1577
02:24:42,083 --> 02:24:47,792
Papa!?
- Yes.

1578
02:24:48,041 --> 02:24:50,874
Murderer of my father, now
do you know understand...

1579
02:24:50,875 --> 02:24:53,874
...why I pretended to
love your daughter.

1580
02:24:53,875 --> 02:24:55,915
To bring you here from London.

1581
02:24:55,916 --> 02:24:59,458
I've killed your other friends.

1582
02:24:59,916 --> 02:25:04,625
Now, it's your turn.

1583
02:25:06,916 --> 02:25:09,915
What happened, uncle?
- Nothing.

1584
02:25:09,916 --> 02:25:12,915
What happened, papa?
- Nothing, my child.

1585
02:25:12,916 --> 02:25:15,999
It seems like I'm not well.

1586
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,082
Let's go from here.
- But papa... - Let's go.

1587
02:25:18,083 --> 02:25:19,332
How can you go this way?

1588
02:25:19,333 --> 02:25:20,458
You've come for the first
time in our house.

1589
02:25:20,459 --> 02:25:21,915
At least have some tea.
- No. It's all right.

1590
02:25:21,916 --> 02:25:23,583
But, uncle...
- We'll talk later son.

1591
02:25:23,584 --> 02:25:25,915
Come, Priya.
- But papa, what happened?

1592
02:25:25,916 --> 02:25:28,915
We had come just now.

1593
02:25:28,916 --> 02:25:31,040
What happened to him so suddenly?

1594
02:25:31,041 --> 02:25:33,915
He was telling that he was not well.

1595
02:25:33,916 --> 02:25:35,957
He was not feeling well?

1596
02:25:35,958 --> 02:25:37,957
Papa, you were all right.

1597
02:25:37,958 --> 02:25:39,207
Then why did we come from there?

1598
02:25:39,208 --> 02:25:42,500
Because I don't want
you to marry him.

1599
02:25:42,958 --> 02:25:45,040
What happened to you so suddenly?

1600
02:25:45,041 --> 02:25:46,207
Why are you saying like this?

1601
02:25:46,208 --> 02:25:48,957
No arguments. I don't
want to hear anything.

1602
02:25:48,958 --> 02:25:51,124
We'll both go back to London.

1603
02:25:51,125 --> 02:25:53,458
And you'll marry a boy of my choice.

1604
02:25:53,459 --> 02:25:55,541
And this is my final decision.
Understood?

1605
02:25:55,542 --> 02:25:57,957
Then, listen to my decision too.

1606
02:25:57,958 --> 02:25:59,957
I'll marry no one, but Raj.

1607
02:25:59,958 --> 02:26:05,667
If you want to go to London,
then you can go alone.

1608
02:26:15,208 --> 02:26:17,915
Raj, my son. A calamity has struck!

1609
02:26:17,916 --> 02:26:22,333
That scum Rakesh Kapoor is taking
your Priya to London.

1610
02:26:22,417 --> 02:26:25,500
He wants her to marry someone else.

1611
02:26:25,916 --> 02:26:27,999
What?!
- Please save Priya.

1612
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,915
Dear Priya is immersed in tears.

1613
02:26:30,916 --> 02:26:34,000
If it was under my control
then I would have cut...

1614
02:26:34,083 --> 02:26:37,041
...that scum Kapoor's
rear with an axe.

1615
02:26:37,042 --> 02:26:43,875
But, what can I do, son? I can't
lift in this old age... the axe.

1616
02:26:43,958 --> 02:26:47,584
But, who are you?
- I'm Kapoor's gardener.

1617
02:26:47,958 --> 02:26:51,041
Son, you are coming, right?
- Yes, I'm coming.

1618
02:26:51,042 --> 02:26:53,207
Latest news. Uncle, he's coming.

1619
02:26:53,208 --> 02:26:54,374
You uncultured brute!

1620
02:26:54,375 --> 02:26:56,207
You were heaving curses
on me, in my presence.

1621
02:26:56,208 --> 02:26:58,957
Uncle, if I had not
cursed you, then...

1622
02:26:58,958 --> 02:27:00,957
...how would have he believed
that I was in his favor?

1623
02:27:00,958 --> 02:27:03,541
You don't know. To catch a lion
you have to cut a pig...

1624
02:27:03,542 --> 02:27:07,874
...and throw it as a
bait in front of him.

1625
02:27:07,875 --> 02:27:10,915
Where are you going, son?
- I got a call from Priya's house.

1626
02:27:10,916 --> 02:27:14,082
Her father is taking her
to London forever.

1627
02:27:14,083 --> 02:27:16,333
How can he take her in this way?

1628
02:27:16,334 --> 02:27:18,915
Priya and I love each
other very much.

1629
02:27:18,916 --> 02:27:20,999
Granny, I can't live without her.

1630
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,207
I won't allow her to go.
- Wait, son.

1631
02:27:23,208 --> 02:27:27,417
I'll come with you too. How can
he hurt children's hearts?

1632
02:27:27,542 --> 02:27:32,500
I'll talk to him. Come.

1633
02:28:13,875 --> 02:28:16,915
Raj, are you going to meet Priya?

1634
02:28:16,916 --> 02:28:19,041
But you'll never be able
to meet anyone again.

1635
02:28:19,042 --> 02:28:22,125
Because it was me who deceived
you to come here.

1636
02:28:23,208 --> 02:28:26,207
I'll kill you and throw you here.

1637
02:28:26,208 --> 02:28:32,625
I challenge you. Come out.

1638
02:28:40,917 --> 02:28:42,999
Granny, that is Tarzan.

1639
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:48,834
But, how did it reach here?

1640
02:28:53,125 --> 02:28:54,291
Sir, your planning was very good!

1641
02:28:54,292 --> 02:28:56,374
You threw that Raj along
with his car...

1642
02:28:56,375 --> 02:28:58,124
...from the mountain and killed him.

1643
02:28:58,125 --> 02:29:01,167
People will think that this is
an accident, but not murder.

1644
02:29:02,208 --> 02:29:04,957
No!
- Priya!

1645
02:29:04,958 --> 02:29:06,957
Priya, stop.

1646
02:29:06,958 --> 02:29:11,292
Granny, my Tarzan! How
did this happen?

1647
02:29:11,875 --> 02:29:17,291
Who did this, granny?

1648
02:29:17,875 --> 02:29:20,957
I was shocked when
I heard that papa...

1649
02:29:20,958 --> 02:29:22,916
...threw you along with Tarzan
from the mountain.

1650
02:29:22,917 --> 02:29:26,916
That means, your papa did all this.

1651
02:29:26,917 --> 02:29:29,249
Yes, I've done it.

1652
02:29:29,250 --> 02:29:31,082
And look, what I do next.

1653
02:29:31,083 --> 02:29:33,916
Papa, please stop.
- Move aside.

1654
02:29:33,917 --> 02:29:35,916
Uncle, please leave her.

1655
02:29:35,917 --> 02:29:38,916
Take her away.

1656
02:29:38,917 --> 02:29:41,916
What are you doing? Leave him.

1657
02:29:41,917 --> 02:29:43,416
Move aside. Move from here.

1658
02:29:43,417 --> 02:29:48,709
I won't leave you. Come.

1659
02:29:57,209 --> 02:29:59,333
Uncle, what are you doing?

1660
02:29:59,334 --> 02:30:01,208
First, you killed my accomplices.

1661
02:30:01,209 --> 02:30:04,208
Now, you want to kill me?

1662
02:30:04,209 --> 02:30:07,874
Uncle, I didn't kill anyone.

1663
02:30:07,875 --> 02:30:10,957
I'll kill you in the same way like...

1664
02:30:10,958 --> 02:30:16,959
...I drowned and killed your father

1665
02:32:56,209 --> 02:32:58,208
This car! This had been
shattered to pieces.

1666
02:32:58,209 --> 02:33:02,833
How did this get here?

1667
02:35:04,208 --> 02:35:08,791
Granny.

1668
02:35:24,917 --> 02:35:27,249
No, Devan. Please forgive me.

1669
02:35:27,250 --> 02:35:31,000
Have mercy on me.
- Did you have mercy on me?

1670
02:35:32,917 --> 02:35:35,041
Did you ever realize,
what would happen...

1671
02:35:35,042 --> 02:35:37,958
...to my mother and my
son after I'm gone?

1672
02:35:37,959 --> 02:35:40,041
My soul was writhing
for twelve years...

1673
02:35:40,042 --> 02:35:42,958
...seeing you and your
accomplices alive.

1674
02:35:42,959 --> 02:35:45,958
Perhaps, it was my mother's
blessings...

1675
02:35:45,959 --> 02:35:49,375
...that my son brought
my car before you.

1676
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:53,250
If I wanted then I could have
killed you there itself...

1677
02:35:53,375 --> 02:35:56,958
...where you were drowning my son.

1678
02:35:56,959 --> 02:35:59,958
But, I wanted to prove that
my son was innocent.

1679
02:35:59,959 --> 02:36:01,541
That's why I brought you here.

1680
02:36:01,542 --> 02:36:04,124
I accept in front of everyone
that I'm your culprit.

1681
02:36:04,125 --> 02:36:06,999
My accomplices and I had
stolen your car's design.

1682
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:09,207
And killed you by deceit.

1683
02:36:09,208 --> 02:36:13,000
Inspector, please arrest me.

1684
02:36:14,208 --> 02:36:18,416
Mr. Kapoor, this is called
the nature's funda.

1685
02:36:19,917 --> 02:36:22,916
Humans commit sins and
try to conceal them.

1686
02:36:22,917 --> 02:36:27,000
But nature unfolds it
and reveals them.

1687
02:36:35,917 --> 02:36:37,207
Mother!

1688
02:36:37,208 --> 02:36:39,249
Son, I was sure that an ill-omened...

1689
02:36:39,250 --> 02:36:42,124
...thing had happened to you.

1690
02:36:42,125 --> 02:36:44,207
Otherwise there's no
place in this world...

1691
02:36:44,208 --> 02:36:47,333
...where a son goes and
forgets his mother.

1692
02:36:48,042 --> 02:36:51,124
When a mother dies in
front of her child...

1693
02:36:51,125 --> 02:36:54,958
...then that mother lives forever.

1694
02:36:54,959 --> 02:36:57,958
When a child dies in
front of his mother...

1695
02:36:57,959 --> 02:37:01,207
...then that mother dies
a thousand deaths.

1696
02:37:01,208 --> 02:37:04,333
Isn't that son unfortunate
who had to leave...

1697
02:37:04,458 --> 02:37:08,458
...his mother and son
crying and perplexed?

1698
02:37:09,917 --> 02:37:13,458
See, even after my death
these eyes are open.

1699
02:37:14,917 --> 02:37:19,333
At the time of my death it
wanted to see you and Raj.

1700
02:37:19,917 --> 02:37:23,333
But neither could it see you...

1701
02:37:23,417 --> 02:37:28,166
...nor did your hands
close the eyelids.

1702
02:37:29,917 --> 02:37:32,916
Mother, if there is a rebirth...

1703
02:37:32,917 --> 02:37:36,166
...then I'll be born
again as your son.

1704
02:37:39,917 --> 02:37:43,834
Papa, you'll leave us and go away?

1705
02:37:47,917 --> 02:37:51,040
I had gone away twelve years back.

1706
02:37:51,041 --> 02:37:52,457
But, it was you...

1707
02:37:52,458 --> 02:37:56,958
...who brought me again
to my mother and you.

1708
02:37:56,959 --> 02:38:01,958
I'm sad that your father couldn't
do anything for you.

1709
02:38:01,959 --> 02:38:04,040
But, I'm happy...

1710
02:38:04,041 --> 02:38:07,207
...that you made a
better car than me.

1711
02:38:07,208 --> 02:38:11,792
And yes, the next time you
take Priya on a ride...

1712
02:38:11,875 --> 02:38:15,166
...don't take your hands
of the steering wheel.

1713
02:38:20,917 --> 02:38:26,625
I'll take your leave.

1714
02:38:44,917 --> 02:38:49,875
'You are the feeling...

1715
02:38:50,041 --> 02:38:55,834
...attached to my heart.'
