1
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:56,673
Give me the cotton.

2
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:59,148
There's a huge loss of blood!

3
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,422
Right now, we are standing
at Lloyd Memorial Hospital.

4
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:17,260
...where the loved singer of millions
Rohan Arya has been admitted.

5
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,396
Rohan Arya met with an accident
few minutes earlier.

6
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:24,434
His condition is said to be
very critical at the moment.

7
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:31,577
Doctors aren't sure whether they
could save Rohan Arya or not.

8
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:32,544
Sharad Baldev Singh Rajput.

9
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:35,352
Journalist.

10
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:39,582
Do you know the meaning of Journalist?

11
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:41,484
Or shall I say it in Hindi?

12
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:47,356
You are telling us to leave from here.
Sorry, Sir. I'll arrange right now.

13
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:51,232
Listen, if you take more that 2 minutes...

14
00:07:51,242 --> 00:07:54,697
then your boss will come
to put the table for us.

15
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:55,998
Mr. Qureshi.

16
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:58,728
How come our names are not here?

17
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:04,307
Mr. Qureshi, it seems you have come
to the wrong address.

18
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,409
Here, a showbiz party is going on.

19
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:11,519
I think Annual Journalist program
is going on somewhere else.

20
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:17,186
How are you, Sharad?
Leave us. You tell about yourself.

21
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:19,916
How is your journalism going on?

22
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:22,816
Has it expired or still alive?

23
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:26,229
It's your misconception, Sharaad.

24
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:32,335
In fact, we have not kept journalism alive
but journalism has kept us alive!!

25
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,836
And may be you too.

26
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:37,874
The only difference is that in spite
of knowing the power of press.

27
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:41,964
You are not able to shoulder
it's responsibility.

28
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:50,110
Sir, when we will understand this...
We will surely come in your shelter!

29
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:54,290
Sir, your table is ready.

30
00:08:54,300 --> 00:09:00,420
Okay, Mr. Qureshi. We will continue this
discussion some other day. Sure!

31
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:07,913
How are you, Shikha?
Many congratulations!!

32
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,646
In fact, I should thank you.

33
00:09:11,656 --> 00:09:13,743
You call me to such places...

34
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:18,683
Where we have to try to write
the things that are in demand

35
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,427
Or else you very well know
that in our newspaper

36
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:25,254
Page 3, 4, 5... are altogether similar.

37
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:27,790
But, now you have to write about our Rohan.

38
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,860
Come, I'll introduce you with Rohan.

39
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:37,553
Meet Mr. Shakeel Ahmed Qureshi.
Editor of Hindi Dally Awaaz.

40
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,357
Mr. Qureshi, how are you?
Fine!

41
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,354
Rohan son, meet Mr. D.K. Shroff.
A.C.P. Crime Branch.

42
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:02,391
He is an amazing human being!
Myself, Rohan Arya.

43
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:04,560
Many Congratulations!!
Thank you.

44
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:07,630
There's style in this superstar!

45
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:17,243
Hey, Gary. Just recently he got stardom...
Everybody likes to enjoy stardom initially.

46
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:20,982
Wow! I got a very good story!!

47
00:10:20,992 --> 00:10:23,517
Do you know that Rekha...

48
00:10:23,527 --> 00:10:29,642
She was telling that yesterday somebody
took her smooch in Ahuja's party.

49
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:33,897
It's of no use.

50
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,467
Look there...

51
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:41,497
Fresh food is being cooked there.
Really? Of a superstar!!

52
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:45,901
Shikha, you gave me so much training
during the contest.

53
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:49,141
How to present oneself at the party...

54
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:50,606
How one should walk...

55
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:55,011
When he should sit and when to stand...
What one should speak...

56
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:58,421
And when one should keep his mouth shut.

57
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:01,833
But, one thing you didn't teach me.

58
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:09,298
When one feels solitude in such crowd...

59
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:12,703
What should he do?

60
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:18,308
Congrats!

61
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:21,506
Sharad Rajput.
Journalist.

62
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:28,318
You sing very well.

63
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,870
So, how do you feel?
Stardom!

64
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,794
Affection of fans?

65
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:39,473
Attention from the press??

66
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:41,708
It's clear, I'm liking it.

67
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:48,427
So, do you intend to continue this?
Sorry, I didn't understand it.

68
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:53,572
Look, Rohan...
I speak very straightly.

69
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,341
Even, I've come here leaving my house.
I'm one from your well wisher.

70
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:05,471
The thing is that a Circus looks good
till the events keep on changing...

71
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,657
Public get bored if there's no change.

72
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:18,225
You didn't understand? Let me explaln...

73
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:23,637
Now that you've become a star!
The drama is over!!

74
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:29,013
Now, we have to do a new drama.

75
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:32,818
If you wish, we can do this drama for you.

76
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:37,813
Like the love story of you and Shikha...
Look, there's nothing like it.

77
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:40,458
So, when did we say it is so...

78
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:43,498
We are telling that we feel so...

79
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:51,296
And our shop runs on
the basis of this only.

80
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:57,865
And what we print...the whole
nation prints the same.

81
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:07,219
Hey, you seem to get angry...

82
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:14,219
Okay, let's have a small
personal interview.

83
00:13:14,229 --> 00:13:16,229
Come on.

84
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:22,258
So, you want my personal interview?

85
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:25,294
The office of Showbiz opens
at 10 in the morning.

86
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:28,972
Take an appointment from
the P.R. department...

87
00:13:28,982 --> 00:13:31,634
and then call me for confirmation.

88
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:35,671
If I get time, interview will take place.

89
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:55,157
Friends, Rohan has achieved that which...

90
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:58,992
no singer in the industry
hasn't achieved yet.

91
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,398
We will hear it all from Rohan.

92
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:07,253
But, before that let me introduce
our business partners...

93
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,580
Our international business partners...

94
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:28,391
Showbiz channel's creative head...
Ms. Shikha Verma.

95
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:37,451
Give a hand once more for Rohan Arya.

96
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:42,270
Ms. Shikha come this side.
Please...

97
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:46,042
Sir, please say her.
Yeah! Come here.

98
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:04,922
These journalists write whatever they like.

99
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:14,553
They should be thrashed!
They publish anything.

100
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:34,023
You must have liked the article too.

101
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:39,497
After all, it's you who said all this.

102
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,680
I didn't say anything to anybody.

103
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:51,407
You seem to think I'm blind!

104
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:57,877
That journalist must have praised you...
And you got carried away, don't you?

105
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,417
Look, I'm in this profession
for the last 3 years.

106
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:05,721
And I very well know how these
media people operates.

107
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:10,592
You must have said 2 things and he added
more spice to it and published the same.

108
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:14,172
Shikha, you are not even ready to hear me.

109
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,399
I don't know what you
are going on imagining?

110
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:23,019
And by the way, what's the point
in getting angry on such articles?

111
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:27,776
The matter isn't of the picture
but your cheap game!

112
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:31,951
What was the necessity
for this filthy publicity?

113
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:38,876
Okay! You've already decided
that I'm the culprit.

114
00:16:38,886 --> 00:16:40,886
Fine! Go on...

115
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:44,868
I'll not say anything.
Fine.

116
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:03,361
I want to clear one thing with you.

117
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:10,816
From today onwards, you consider me
as your manager only and not your friend!

118
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,389
Hey, what are you doing?
What are you doing??

119
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:24,819
Why are you touching the camera?
What's your problem?

120
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:27,662
Did I stop you from singing?

121
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:31,266
Or did I stop you from making merriment
with your girl friend?

122
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:33,895
Since, we are not putting
hurdle in your work...

123
00:23:33,905 --> 00:23:35,704
then, why are you doing it to us?

124
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:37,714
Look, you are a star!

125
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:39,674
And our job is to click pictures of star!!

126
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:41,309
Go and carry on...

127
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:43,319
Give me the camera.

128
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,628
You are indeed very smart!!

129
00:23:57,402 --> 00:24:01,797
You could share the bed with the girl
to win the contest.

130
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:05,656
And you aren't ready to
click a photo either...

131
00:24:05,666 --> 00:24:08,896
with her after getting your work done?

132
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:33,677
You are fighting in the premises...

133
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:37,842
Hey, we are media person.
Come on get away!

134
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:09,837
"When a star's photograph
was clicked with...

135
00:25:09,847 --> 00:25:14,012
his girl friend, he beat
the innocent journalist"

136
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:29,314
You'll deserve to be a journalist.

137
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:46,868
Hey, boys! This is just a beginning.
You'll get more of it ahead!

138
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:52,641
When you will see this simple story in the
breaking news segment of our channel.

139
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:57,979
Then, you'll come to know that the audience
likes to see such things only.

140
00:25:57,989 --> 00:26:00,753
You are great!
He is right!!

141
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:04,674
But, what shall we do next?
It's simple.

142
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:10,358
This boy Rohan Arya will become a big star
after this breaking news!

143
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:14,362
Those people who don't know about him...
will be eager to know.

144
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:18,567
And will be restless waiting
to know more about it.

145
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:21,403
Public loves these stars very much!

146
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:24,739
They worship them but, are even
jealous of them too.

147
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:28,810
When this stars fall to the ground,
public enjoys the most!

148
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,613
To make stars and to make them fall.

149
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:35,784
There's no other paying business
for media other than this.

150
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:38,262
Guys! Follow Rohan Arya.

151
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:41,222
If you don't have story then make one.

152
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:47,352
I need that material which could make
the audience switch to our channel.

153
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:52,867
Story! Rumor! Fake
story!! Private moments!!

154
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:10,082
Ranjeet, it's your responsibility.

155
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:13,618
Whatever news we will
setup on Uncle's channel.

156
00:27:13,628 --> 00:27:16,257
We should have complete details with us.

157
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:19,412
Can't say when could we require what?

158
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,832
He is a strange man!

159
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:29,197
He was with his girl friend.
I move forward to take the picture.

160
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,674
Now, he is a star and our
job is to take picture.

161
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:35,574
You tell me, where did I go wrong?

162
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:40,772
If someone would raise hand
on poor journalist like me then...

163
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:45,609
If the freedom of press is
muffled this way then...

164
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:49,971
It's up to the government
to decide upon it.

165
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:58,377
Then, they'll get fights
and kicks from all the...

166
00:27:58,387 --> 00:27:59,901
celebrities.

167
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:04,586
Who is Rohan? I don't know any Rohan??
No, I don't know?

168
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,811
He beat that reporter.
He did very right.

169
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:14,249
If it was my boy friend in his place then,
he would have run away!

170
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:19,104
See Rohan, it isn't such that
I don't want to do anything.

171
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:22,424
The fact is that I couldn't do anything!

172
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:25,727
You are seeing this for the first time.
Isn't it?

173
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:28,882
But, I've seen such thing many times.

174
00:28:29,774 --> 00:28:32,749
This is what we call show business!

175
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:39,649
Look Rohan, their job is not to
make moral judgment.

176
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:42,844
Their job is just to sell the product.

177
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:46,793
Now, either the product
sells from your songs...

178
00:28:46,803 --> 00:28:50,373
or from the program which is going against

179
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:58,081
If it is so, then I couldn't
associate myself...

180
00:28:58,091 --> 00:28:59,294
with such company.

181
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:03,979
...which couldn't differentiate
between truth and lies.

182
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:11,212
Then, you could not work in any company.

183
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:15,887
Because every company does the same thing.

184
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:20,561
Look Rohan, you don't
worry of these things.

185
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,717
You concentrate on music.

186
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:25,228
Rest you leave on me.

187
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:28,596
Till I'm here, no one could harm you.

188
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:34,243
Such time will not come.

189
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:40,265
So much lies...
So much cackling...

190
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:45,406
I'll go forever leaving all this!

191
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:48,561
Look son, why don't you understand...

192
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,227
Okay, then book his tickets.

193
00:29:59,397 --> 00:30:02,357
If he wishes to go back home then,
Let him go!

194
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:05,427
As it is there's no one to stop him.

195
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:07,595
Who was it?

196
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:10,240
Nobody... it was Rajan's phone.

197
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:14,263
He was telling that Rohan wants to go home.

198
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:18,807
It's sales paper, do sign it.

199
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,708
If he wishes to go, let him go!

200
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:24,745
As it is he wasn't happy
surrounded by scandals.

201
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:23,772
Where are you going, Rohan?
Home!

202
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:29,578
Why?
I don't have any reason to wait either.

203
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:32,753
And if you get a reason then?

204
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:05,443
For the past few days, you'll
were worried whether...

205
00:32:05,453 --> 00:32:09,217
there's something going
between both of us or not.

206
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:12,712
Today, I want to finish all these rumors.

207
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:21,495
By saying that I fall in
completely in love with him!

208
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:18,608
Taara, I have the booty!

209
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:21,577
You pick pocketed?
Yes.

210
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:24,240
Show me whose it is?
Show me.

211
00:36:25,249 --> 00:36:27,249
It's Rohan's...

212
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:34,882
I took it from that crowd.

213
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:42,225
I felt that he did see me while
I was taking it out.

214
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,535
You bitch! Give me this wallet.

215
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:48,696
Consider our job of 15 days is done!

216
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:51,256
Look, how much money is there.

217
00:37:06,924 --> 00:37:11,884
You bitch! If you do it again.
I'll kill you!

218
00:37:32,683 --> 00:37:39,316
Pray good fortune for
the owner of this money!

219
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:49,914
I haven't thought that this album will get
such an overwhelming response.

220
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:56,664
I could see it clearly
what Mr. Behl is thinking.

221
00:37:56,674 --> 00:38:01,089
He seem to be thinking when
I'll stop my chattering,

222
00:38:01,099 --> 00:38:03,479
so that he could start his!!

223
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,855
Today, I have much more to say.

224
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:15,616
Therefore, you have to listen
to my chatter for sometime.

225
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:18,919
Friends, today is a very big day for us.

226
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:23,357
Because Rohan's album has become
number #1 in music chart!

227
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:27,192
Not only this but there's
another good news!!

228
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:36,613
Germany's company Granada
has decided that they...

229
00:38:36,623 --> 00:38:41,379
will sponsor the 1st
international trip of Rohan Arya.

230
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:47,611
It's indeed a pleasure that
Rohan being a winner of a...

231
00:38:47,621 --> 00:38:52,041
talent contest is going to
become a music icon today!

232
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:58,859
And our creative head Ms. Shikha Verma
is going to Delhi to finalize this tour.

233
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:08,379
All these jokers like
Mr. Behl have the same tendency...

234
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:11,948
To become the owner of channel!

235
00:39:14,218 --> 00:39:17,345
As if the ownership of channel
is distributed free gift!

236
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:23,560
He is willing to make his own news channel
for the last 3 years! 3 years!!

237
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:29,026
And what you all are doing?

238
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,095
And what you all are doing?

239
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:36,765
You were out to make a
love story of Rohan Arya?

240
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:38,366
What happen?

241
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,936
Rohan Arya's album got hit and his
love story turned to be a hit!

242
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:44,372
Also Mr. Behl's T.R.P. has rise.

243
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:47,952
I don't like the smile on Mr. Behl's face!

244
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:51,212
We are already behind him...

245
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:54,338
But, the one in whose life
there's no botheration...

246
00:39:54,348 --> 00:39:55,783
How could we create one?

247
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:57,818
What you can do?
Idiots!

248
00:39:59,263 --> 00:40:02,493
Try to understand the power of camera.

249
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:13,434
There's something or the other hidden
in everyone's life.

250
00:40:13,444 --> 00:40:16,589
Follow him for 24 hours.
Now, get out!

251
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:04,771
Hey listen, where could I find Taara?
Over there.

252
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:38,492
Go away from here!!
Listen to me.

253
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:40,988
Why aren't you understanding?
Listen to me.

254
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:44,823
I don't want to listen anything.
Listen to me.

255
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,505
Please listen to me...

256
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:53,901
You come with me.
I'm there with you.

257
00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:22,345
Do you have a matchstick?
Who are these people?

258
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:28,269
Rohan, who are these people?
Taara, I know them.

259
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:32,699
Let us shoot you both...
we'll show it in prime time!

260
00:42:39,523 --> 00:42:41,523
Get away from here!!

261
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:51,667
Stop the car, Rohan!

262
00:42:58,442 --> 00:43:01,468
I'll not allow anything happen to you.

263
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:03,478
Stop the car, Rohan!

264
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:06,424
Don't pay attention there.

265
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:11,787
Hey Gary, follow them.

266
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:05,807
Isn't it a good shot?

267
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:21,355
Brother, what next?

268
00:44:38,275 --> 00:44:42,780
It's very bad to drive the
car after drinking liquor.

269
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,480
Make him bath in it.

270
00:44:49,253 --> 00:44:52,416
What super star?
Will you drink it?

271
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:55,713
Why are you showing fingers at me?

272
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:10,806
Drink it!

273
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:23,741
Go and lower the zip of that girl.

274
00:45:25,823 --> 00:45:27,823
Come on, go...

275
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:42,498
Brother, she is still alive!

276
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:46,433
She could be saved if we call an ambulance.

277
00:45:46,443 --> 00:45:49,078
Hey,just listen and understand.

278
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:53,450
We are not social workers but journalists!

279
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:55,876
And right now we will gain from her death!

280
00:45:55,886 --> 00:46:02,176
We have to cover this incident without
doing anything. Is it okay? Come on.

281
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:38,596
It's been reported that a taxi
driver and a call girl...

282
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:40,747
is involved in this accident as well.

283
00:47:40,757 --> 00:47:45,552
This call girl was present with Rohan Arya
in the car at the time of accident.

284
00:47:45,562 --> 00:47:47,287
Please say without any hesitation.

285
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:50,424
You don't worry!
Your son will get justice!!

286
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:53,227
Look at this camera.
Please say...

287
00:47:53,237 --> 00:48:02,839
We only want that whatever happened...
should not be forgotten easily.

288
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:07,949
I've lost my son!

289
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:14,222
He is our family...

290
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:24,196
Now, whoever is responsible for this
should be punished.

291
00:48:24,206 --> 00:48:26,496
He will surely be punished!

292
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:44,244
Rohan was seen with a call girl.
What relation does he have with her?

293
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:47,748
There was a call girl in Rohan's car.
What is the relation between them?

294
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:50,350
Who is that girl?
What is her name?

295
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:53,675
Why aren't you answering our questions?

296
00:48:55,499 --> 00:48:58,559
Enough! Get everybody put from here.

297
00:49:54,291 --> 00:49:56,291
Relax! Mr. Rohan.

298
00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:04,658
All of your reports are normal.
You'll be discharged very soon.

299
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:08,695
And I feel that you could do a show
within a week.

300
00:50:08,705 --> 00:50:13,767
What happen to that girl who was with me?
Yeah, that girl is in comma.

301
00:50:13,777 --> 00:50:18,112
Nothing could be said right now.
But, we are trying.

302
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:35,270
Kamble, get these reporters back...

303
00:50:35,298 --> 00:50:38,592
Our channel showed you the grievance
of the mother of that taxi driver.

304
00:50:38,602 --> 00:50:41,595
What is your comment on it.
We want to know it from you.

305
00:50:41,605 --> 00:50:44,431
That where do you post Rohan Arya?

306
00:50:44,441 --> 00:50:46,867
You could send your suggestion through SMS.

307
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:51,328
If you feel Rohan Arya is
innocent then you pick up...

308
00:50:51,338 --> 00:50:55,418
the phone and type ROHY
and send it to us on 3131

309
00:51:03,493 --> 00:51:07,998
Look Rohan, you yourself
are increasing your trouble.

310
00:51:08,965 --> 00:51:15,255
According to the blood report it s known
that you weren't drunk that night.

311
00:51:16,506 --> 00:51:19,651
Even this news was broke by NNN News.

312
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:24,820
Just like your previous
stories, your accident's...

313
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:27,216
footage reached them first.

314
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:30,777
Even before the police reached there.

315
00:51:30,787 --> 00:51:34,314
Was someone following
you before the accident?

316
00:51:34,324 --> 00:51:37,894
Or did you see anybody after the accident?

317
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:43,663
Or this accident took place
because of somebody else?

318
00:51:49,806 --> 00:51:51,806
Tell me.

319
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:56,336
There's nothing you could
achieve by remaining silent.

320
00:51:56,346 --> 00:51:57,871
Who was that girl?

321
00:51:57,881 --> 00:52:00,474
What's the relation between you and her?

322
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:05,499
Look Rohan, if you are hiding it because
of any fear then...

323
00:52:21,238 --> 00:52:23,238
Your ball is done.

324
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:29,719
Rohan, do you know what
really your problem is?

325
00:52:29,779 --> 00:52:35,877
You are unable to make sure who is with you
and who is against you.

326
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:40,650
Now, this doesn't make any difference.

327
00:52:44,694 --> 00:52:46,694
Srivastav.
Yes, Sir.

328
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:51,712
Keep an eye on him.
Yes, Sir.

329
00:52:52,602 --> 00:52:57,107
You don't bother, Rohan.
I'll muffle this case anyway.

330
00:52:57,941 --> 00:53:02,776
As it is the memory of people is very weak!

331
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:06,206
They'll remember today
but will forget tomorrow.

332
00:53:06,216 --> 00:53:08,216
Even you forget it!

333
00:53:08,818 --> 00:53:14,003
And the business loss I've incurred...
I'll forget it as well.

334
00:53:16,293 --> 00:53:18,293
Shikha had called up.

335
00:53:21,598 --> 00:53:23,598
She is hurt for sure!

336
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:31,363
Look son, everybody commits mistake.

337
00:53:32,309 --> 00:53:36,559
But, one who doesn't learn
from mistakes is a fool!

338
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:11,841
I'm talking with you just to make sure
that you don't call me henceforth.

339
00:54:14,217 --> 00:54:17,277
I'm not used to defamation like you.

340
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:22,350
It would be better if you
live your life accordingly.

341
00:54:24,628 --> 00:54:26,838
And leave on my condition.

342
01:01:10,233 --> 01:01:12,613
For what have you come here?

343
01:01:12,769 --> 01:01:14,828
For smashing?
For murder?

344
01:01:17,306 --> 01:01:19,900
Get out from here, Shikha.
Why?

345
01:01:20,777 --> 01:01:24,347
How would you perform
without the audience?

346
01:01:29,419 --> 01:01:31,853
Go and kill him...

347
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:35,915
I haven't come here to stop you.

348
01:01:35,925 --> 01:01:40,940
I just wanted to see, till what extent
you could go further.

349
01:01:42,331 --> 01:01:48,895
You want to kill that reporter because he
has exposed your merriment before public?

350
01:01:48,905 --> 01:01:52,705
Due to which you've lost your stardom!

351
01:01:53,342 --> 01:01:59,804
But, how could you hide this truth
which you are about to do?

352
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:03,528
That too for a small time prostitute!

353
01:02:09,592 --> 01:02:14,097
If somebody else other than you
have said this then...

354
01:02:15,264 --> 01:02:20,959
Whom you are calling a prostitute...
Do you want to know who she is?

355
01:02:23,473 --> 01:02:25,473
She was my 'Sister'

356
01:02:36,452 --> 01:02:38,377
What happen?

357
01:02:38,387 --> 01:02:40,852
We need to speak to you, Sir.

358
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:44,016
I want to say one thing to you, Rohan.

359
01:02:44,026 --> 01:02:50,363
In this war, justice means to
present them before the law.

360
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:53,334
To undress their truth!

361
01:02:53,803 --> 01:03:00,602
For this you need to gather each and every
evidence that could prove them guilty.

362
01:03:00,612 --> 01:03:02,610
I am with you.

363
01:04:38,574 --> 01:04:40,614
Where is the tape, Gary?

364
01:04:40,676 --> 01:04:44,270
Hey, why have you come here?
I said, where are the tapes?

365
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:48,275
Hey, why have you come here?
Don't come forward.

366
01:04:48,285 --> 01:04:50,284
Don't come forward.

367
01:05:09,772 --> 01:05:11,812
Where is the tape, Gary?

368
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:29,042
Rohan, help me!
I don't want to die!!

369
01:06:37,793 --> 01:06:41,229
Where is the tape?
Which tape??

370
01:06:42,698 --> 01:06:44,657
Where is that tape?

371
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:51,569
Araam Nagar, bungalow
#14, in our editing room.

372
01:06:51,579 --> 01:06:53,232
We do all our editing at Ranjeet's place.

373
01:06:53,242 --> 01:06:58,475
Whatever you want, you'll get it there.

374
01:06:59,482 --> 01:07:02,542
Please save me!
I don't want to die!!

375
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:11,329
Were you going to really kill me?

376
01:07:13,763 --> 01:07:19,203
Shall I tell you one thing, super star?
Will you feel bad for it?

377
01:07:19,435 --> 01:07:24,043
How did you feel when we
published your photo with...

378
01:07:24,053 --> 01:07:28,400
that item girl thereby
ruining your entire career!

379
01:08:16,659 --> 01:08:19,526
How did this happen?
Head injury!

380
01:08:25,234 --> 01:08:27,699
He used to work with you all.

381
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:34,206
Now, you only tell whether this
was an accident or something else...

382
01:08:37,213 --> 01:08:41,582
We think this is an accident case.

383
01:08:42,218 --> 01:08:43,776
Mr. Sharaad, you tell me...

384
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:47,654
Did he have rivalry with somebody?

385
01:08:50,259 --> 01:08:54,286
No. I don't think so...

386
01:08:56,398 --> 01:09:00,138
And why there should be?
Why not, Mr. Rajput?

387
01:09:00,302 --> 01:09:03,462
You people do work with such courage.

388
01:09:03,472 --> 01:09:07,231
You present news honestly
before the public.

389
01:09:09,345 --> 01:09:15,648
You people must have less friends...
More enemies!!

390
01:09:21,557 --> 01:09:27,592
Take my card. Don't hesitate to contact me
if you have something to say.

391
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:50,217
Yes, Sir. I want to finalize
the deal immediately.

392
01:10:35,598 --> 01:10:38,257
Hey, Sharad...
Why are you sitting there?

393
01:10:38,267 --> 01:10:40,267
Come on, get up!

394
01:10:40,703 --> 01:10:45,631
What is this hurry for which you requested
me to come here late in the night?

395
01:10:45,641 --> 01:10:47,681
To show you this only...

396
01:10:48,444 --> 01:10:51,003
The chair is yours and I'm sitting on it!

397
01:10:51,013 --> 01:10:54,807
And he says that it
suits me rather than you.

398
01:10:54,817 --> 01:10:57,343
Now tell me, what's your opinion?

399
01:10:57,353 --> 01:11:01,413
I think you've drunk too much.
Go home. We'll talk tomorrow.

400
01:11:01,423 --> 01:11:05,792
I did not drink but,
I'm intoxicated for sure!!

401
01:11:08,397 --> 01:11:13,359
I had come in this business with
the dream of sitting on this chair.

402
01:11:13,369 --> 01:11:18,554
Today, I'm seated on it...
So how could I remain in my senses?

403
01:11:43,799 --> 01:11:45,891
Stop wasting my time.
What exactly you want?

404
01:11:45,901 --> 01:11:48,366
Sir, you are getting angry...

405
01:11:48,737 --> 01:11:50,863
We have come here to fulfill our promise.

406
01:11:50,873 --> 01:11:56,313
Didn't I tell you that we will give
you a sizzling breaking news?

407
01:12:00,582 --> 01:12:03,132
Why didn't you tell me before?

408
01:12:07,756 --> 01:12:10,391
My channel has made you stars!!

409
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:30,170
There's no other paying business
for media other than this.

410
01:12:32,481 --> 01:12:34,506
If you don't have story then make one.

411
01:12:34,516 --> 01:12:39,249
Story! Rumor! Fake
story!! Private moments!!

412
01:12:39,521 --> 01:12:43,787
This Rohan Arya has bought
our T.R.P. so high!

413
01:12:54,036 --> 01:12:56,161
Shikha, call Mr. Qureshi.

414
01:13:03,579 --> 01:13:05,874
How much money do you want?

415
01:13:10,619 --> 01:13:14,248
Money? No, Sir.
I don't want money.

416
01:13:19,261 --> 01:13:22,389
I want the power of that chair!

417
01:13:24,266 --> 01:13:28,430
The power of making and destroying lives!

418
01:13:29,271 --> 01:13:33,011
The power of changing
the thought of people.

419
01:13:34,276 --> 01:13:40,237
And the power to let loose
this T.V. on anybody.

420
01:13:41,316 --> 01:13:47,380
Means we have decided to buy this channel.

421
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:52,892
And if you don't want to
become breaking news...

422
01:13:52,902 --> 01:13:55,789
before the rest of the channel...

423
01:13:56,632 --> 01:13:59,182
Then, you better listen to us.

424
01:14:09,878 --> 01:14:13,205
This NNN channel is really
a very huge network!

425
01:14:13,215 --> 01:14:16,360
You need a lot of money to take over.

426
01:14:17,786 --> 01:14:20,813
From where will you bring the money?

427
01:14:20,823 --> 01:14:23,792
We have the buyer. The
paper is being ready.

428
01:14:23,802 --> 01:14:25,217
And a new office too.

429
01:14:25,227 --> 01:14:29,388
Only your signatures and
official announcement is left.

430
01:14:29,398 --> 01:14:34,293
Tomorrow our new owner of NNN channel
will meet you in our new office.

431
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:36,303
Who is he?

432
01:14:39,708 --> 01:14:43,278
We will let you know but after this break!

433
01:14:46,882 --> 01:14:49,241
Where are you?
I just reached home.

434
01:14:49,251 --> 01:14:50,242
Come here quickly with the master.

435
01:14:50,252 --> 01:14:54,332
Brother, I'll just transfer
the master and come.

436
01:15:36,298 --> 01:15:40,234
If you want to stay
alive then, do as I say...

437
01:15:49,011 --> 01:15:55,274
Sharaad Rajput and Chandrakant Jain... are
the small fishes in this ocean of crime!

438
01:15:55,284 --> 01:16:03,214
They have their father, who very quietly
is using both of them.

439
01:16:09,798 --> 01:16:15,365
One such person who doesn't
have any stain on him!

440
01:16:15,375 --> 01:16:20,433
Who launched his 1st T.V. channel
on rented broadband.

441
01:16:21,877 --> 01:16:28,677
Whose slogan was 'from common people,
to common people and for the common people'

442
01:16:29,851 --> 01:16:36,450
Even today, he is about to take over
a new channel by means of fraud!

443
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:41,486
Whose name is 'SHOWBIZ PLUS'

444
01:17:05,187 --> 01:17:08,247
How are you Mr. Jain?
You scoundrel!

445
01:17:08,857 --> 01:17:11,322
So, you are behind this game!

446
01:17:12,794 --> 01:17:16,874
500 millions! This is the
price of your NNN news?

447
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:20,826
Mr. Qureshi, how much time do I have?

448
01:17:20,836 --> 01:17:22,836
Only 1 minute, Rohan.

449
01:17:32,781 --> 01:17:36,763
By the way, will you read
it before signing it...

450
01:17:36,773 --> 01:17:38,773
or will you trust us?

451
01:17:43,692 --> 01:17:48,452
I'll never sell my network to
a stupid press on like him!

452
01:17:49,264 --> 01:17:51,264
Sign it!

453
01:17:52,267 --> 01:17:55,961
Or else tomorrow
morning merger will be announced.

454
01:17:55,971 --> 01:17:59,407
Or else your tapes will be public!

455
01:18:08,517 --> 01:18:12,039
I want the masters of
all the tapes and CD's...

456
01:18:12,049 --> 01:18:13,545
that are against me.

457
01:18:13,555 --> 01:18:17,751
Along with it, I need a
written undertaking that...

458
01:18:17,761 --> 01:18:21,586
you will never show such
things to the public!

459
01:18:23,565 --> 01:18:26,200
You know what you have to do...

460
01:18:27,436 --> 01:18:30,241
Did you get it.
Now, come on go...

461
01:18:32,441 --> 01:18:38,236
Mr. Jain, after this deal is finalized...
We will not make this tape public.

462
01:18:38,246 --> 01:18:43,275
If we will do then, will the public
not throw their shoes at us?

463
01:18:43,285 --> 01:18:46,344
Our creditability will
be zero in the market.

464
01:18:46,354 --> 01:18:50,179
Ours will be an image
of black mailer then...

465
01:18:55,564 --> 01:19:01,089
Mr. Jain, even your stars are against you.
Therefore,just sign it.

466
01:19:12,214 --> 01:19:17,151
Brother, take this.
Sorry for being late, brother.

467
01:19:20,922 --> 01:19:22,748
I had gone for your work only.

468
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:24,850
Don't spoil my braln...
Which work are you talking about?

469
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:27,519
So, you are going to Hong Kong Sharad?

470
01:19:27,529 --> 01:19:29,529
What? Where am I going?

471
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:32,290
You are going to Hong Kong.

472
01:19:35,570 --> 01:19:37,570
Ranjeet, come here.

473
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:39,731
From where did you get this ticket?

474
01:19:39,741 --> 01:19:40,665
Who gave you this?

475
01:19:40,675 --> 01:19:43,201
Brother...
Who gave you the ticket?

476
01:19:43,211 --> 01:19:45,203
That Jaadugar Network...
They have given this ticket.

477
01:19:45,213 --> 01:19:49,809
No, Mr. Behl.
There's a game being played here...

478
01:19:50,585 --> 01:19:53,305
He will disclose everything now.

479
01:19:53,688 --> 01:19:55,688
Who send you here?

480
01:19:58,293 --> 01:20:01,863
Give me the gun.
You are not understanding.

481
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:10,829
Mr. Behl, he has come
here on instruction of someone.

482
01:20:10,839 --> 01:20:14,579
He hasn't come this way...
Tell me the truth.

483
01:20:14,609 --> 01:20:19,271
Don't you know me, Mr. Behl?
In fact, I want to know you!

484
01:20:19,281 --> 01:20:23,608
And I want to know what deal have
you finalize with Jaadugar network?

485
01:20:23,618 --> 01:20:29,352
I'll tell you what deal he has done
with Jaadugar network.

486
01:20:36,431 --> 01:20:40,251
Before you could begin
this new entertainment

487
01:20:40,261 --> 01:20:44,081
Channel. He planned to
close this right away.

488
01:20:44,606 --> 01:20:50,602
You only gave him the power to deal.
By making him CEO.

489
01:20:51,313 --> 01:20:54,282
He is speaking nonsense, Mr. Behl.

490
01:20:54,816 --> 01:20:55,707
Don't listen to him.

491
01:20:55,717 --> 01:20:58,805
Okay, if I'm speaking
rubbish then, would you...

492
01:20:58,815 --> 01:21:01,580
clarify why you've put hidden cameras here?

493
01:21:01,590 --> 01:21:03,590
What?
Hidden cameras!!

494
01:21:05,694 --> 01:21:08,584
No! I haven't...
Have you gone mad?

495
01:21:09,631 --> 01:21:12,691
There is no hidden camera here.
Why are you looking this way?

496
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:14,226
He is making you infuriated.
Can't you understand?

497
01:21:14,236 --> 01:21:16,531
Where it is?
I can't see it.

498
01:21:17,405 --> 01:21:20,298
Will I put hidden camera to make
myself visible to the camera?

499
01:21:20,308 --> 01:21:21,766
Have you consider me to be an ass?

500
01:21:21,776 --> 01:21:25,403
I haven't but it's you
who have consider this.

501
01:21:25,413 --> 01:21:28,240
What does this 3rd deal means?
I'll tell you, what's happening.

502
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:31,243
Behl you are indeed an ass!
Can't you understand?

503
01:21:31,253 --> 01:21:33,778
This Sharaad is double crossing you.
He is playing games with you.

504
01:21:33,788 --> 01:21:36,414
What did he do with an innocent
media man like me?

505
01:21:36,424 --> 01:21:41,327
He is black malling me
by making fake tapes...

506
01:21:41,463 --> 01:21:46,491
By recording all this from these cameras,
he will black mail, you as well.

507
01:21:46,501 --> 01:21:51,529
Rohan is right. There is definitely
hidden cameras here. No, it is not.

508
01:21:51,539 --> 01:21:53,031
There are no hidden cameras here.

509
01:21:53,041 --> 01:21:56,801
You think I've put hidden cameras here
to defame you all.

510
01:21:56,811 --> 01:21:58,811
Then, listen to this...

511
01:21:59,414 --> 01:22:03,299
Myself, Sharad Baldev
Singh Rajput, a journalist.

512
01:22:03,309 --> 01:22:05,844
In all my senses confess that...

513
01:22:05,854 --> 01:22:08,526
I've done black malling on
the pretext of being a...

514
01:22:08,536 --> 01:22:10,282
journalist. I have done extortion.

515
01:22:10,292 --> 01:22:11,750
Will I tell all these?

516
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:15,387
Further, to give breaking
news continuously...

517
01:22:15,397 --> 01:22:18,038
On the gesture of Mr. Jain,
I planned the accident...

518
01:22:18,048 --> 01:22:19,791
of Rohan in which 1 man was killed.

519
01:22:19,801 --> 01:22:23,395
Why are you telling lies!
When did I say you to do the accident?

520
01:22:23,405 --> 01:22:24,262
You are lying, Mr. Jain.

521
01:22:24,272 --> 01:22:28,862
You even said that thing...
What line was it brother...

522
01:22:34,282 --> 01:22:39,297
Just for the sake of one news
you ruined a life of this boy!

523
01:22:40,522 --> 01:22:42,280
And you... What are you?

524
01:22:42,290 --> 01:22:43,648
I'm better than you.

525
01:22:43,658 --> 01:22:45,658
And you, Mr. Behl?

526
01:22:46,027 --> 01:22:50,702
When Sharad gave you Mr. Jain's tape...
What did you do?

527
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:54,100
If you had so much affection
for me then, you must...

528
01:22:54,110 --> 01:22:55,694
have given that tape to the police.

529
01:22:55,704 --> 01:22:57,862
You could have arrested them.

530
01:22:57,872 --> 01:23:01,433
But, you used that tape to blackmail him.

531
01:23:02,377 --> 01:23:04,402
To expand your business.

532
01:23:04,412 --> 01:23:08,273
Mr. Behl, in whose talking
are you indulging yourself??

533
01:23:08,283 --> 01:23:10,608
I've already told you there's
no hidden cameras here.

534
01:23:10,618 --> 01:23:14,212
There's no need for white collar drama!
Take this and sign it.

535
01:23:14,222 --> 01:23:15,547
Don't tell me what I shall do.

536
01:23:15,557 --> 01:23:17,816
First tell me what is this 3rd deal?

537
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:20,708
I told you whosoever will
give him more money,

538
01:23:20,718 --> 01:23:22,220
he will be slave to him.

539
01:23:22,230 --> 01:23:23,621
I don't want any money.
I want to become a CEO.

540
01:23:23,631 --> 01:23:25,690
You have not done this right.

541
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:30,662
I knew Jain from early days itself.
I never expect you would go to such extent.

542
01:23:30,672 --> 01:23:33,732
Nobody could escape alive from here.

543
01:23:36,578 --> 01:23:40,573
Even this is a face which
represents our media.

544
01:23:40,648 --> 01:23:44,576
Media works to pull the
filthiness in the society.

545
01:23:44,586 --> 01:23:48,880
But who will do the work of pulling
the filthiness of the media?

546
01:23:48,890 --> 01:23:52,630
Who will take the news
of the media persons?

547
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:56,393
He is disloyal person!

548
01:23:56,403 --> 01:23:58,823
People like you have spoiled media's image.

549
01:23:58,833 --> 01:24:01,638
There are no hidden cameras here.

550
01:24:04,272 --> 01:24:09,642
How strange it is?
First time, Sharad is speaking the truth.

551
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:14,280
And nobody trust him!

552
01:24:16,651 --> 01:24:19,626
Sharad has not put any camera here.

553
01:24:20,221 --> 01:24:22,221
Did you hear.
But...

554
01:24:28,263 --> 01:24:31,068
There's indeed one hidden camera.

555
01:24:36,237 --> 01:24:40,657
And your complete discussion
has been broadcast live!

556
01:25:20,381 --> 01:25:22,381
I'll kill him!!

557
01:25:22,817 --> 01:25:24,817
I'll kill him!!

558
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:43,125
Leave me! Will you handcuff
me in single hand?

559
01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:48,300
No one will come forward.
Don't move!

560
01:25:51,312 --> 01:25:54,967
Hey, don't move!
Or else I'll kill everyone.

561
01:26:33,655 --> 01:26:36,814
Do you want to know
who was the girl in the accident?

562
01:26:36,824 --> 01:26:39,918
She was my sister!

563
01:26:47,402 --> 01:26:49,402
She was my sister!

564
01:26:50,371 --> 01:26:52,371
Rohan, stop!

565
01:26:53,508 --> 01:26:55,508
Rohan, stop!

566
01:27:23,204 --> 01:27:27,398
Sharad Rajput, Chandrakant Jain
and Inder Raj Behl has been arrested!

567
01:27:27,408 --> 01:27:29,044
They are the same people whose...

568
01:27:29,054 --> 01:27:31,436
live sting operation we
just now saw on the T.V.

569
01:27:31,446 --> 01:27:35,473
In regard to this, police has already
arrested Sharad's associate Nakul Waghmare.

570
01:27:35,483 --> 01:27:41,980
This is that ugly face of the media that
each journalist would be ashamed of...

571
01:27:41,990 --> 01:27:45,369
Time has come for us to
peep in our inner side...

572
01:27:45,379 --> 01:27:48,620
and judge how much filth
is present amongst us.

573
01:27:48,630 --> 01:27:50,755
Let's talk to Rohan Arya.

574
01:27:54,836 --> 01:27:57,395
Today, I've come to know one thing...

575
01:27:57,405 --> 01:28:01,199
Whatever happened today...
I'm responsible for it!

576
01:28:01,209 --> 01:28:05,884
When we achieve stardom, we start
hiding from the media.

577
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:15,470
Even I committed this mistake!

578
01:28:15,590 --> 01:28:20,605
But, to hide my personal secret...
I have to pay this price!

579
01:28:21,462 --> 01:28:23,462
I never thought of it.

580
01:28:26,467 --> 01:28:28,467
My sister Taara...

581
01:28:29,470 --> 01:28:36,015
Got lost in the dark nights of this city,
just to save me from getting defame!

582
01:28:38,212 --> 01:28:40,762
This was our biggest mistakes!

583
01:28:41,382 --> 01:28:45,202
If we hadn't hide this
from the media then...

584
01:28:45,212 --> 01:28:49,117
Even media wouldn't have
dig this much either.

585
01:28:51,392 --> 01:28:54,962
Now, I'll not hide my sister from anybody.
