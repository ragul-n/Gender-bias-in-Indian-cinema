3
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:20,000
There are no English subtitles in the movie.
So we have translated Bangla directly into Telugu.

4
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The 100 percent full dialog does not match
Trying to complete 90 percent of the work.

5
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Even then, if there is something wrong with unseen things,
Do it for a brave job.

7
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,700
There is no relation to this city with me

8
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,010
My lover does not like me

9
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,480
I am not ashamed of my childhood

10
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:49,650
There is no way to do anything other than comedy

11
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:53,700
I was born as a small boy
Now he has become a young man

12
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,030
When he is successful in life

13
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:57,640
She is called celebrity

14
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,440
But girls are born in celebrity celebrity

15
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,210
In a critical condition the hospital was brought to this place

16
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,330
It seems that the operation will take a lot of time

17
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,340
Soon you hear my story

18
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,730
There was a day of rainy season

19
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,680
Parents carefully

20
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:00,660
Eating, did not you get the pain?
Once you get the pain, you do not have the chance of getting twice

21
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,760
The second time you get the pain

22
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:10,010
If you get the second time pain, then
The 3rd is a good thing

23
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,440
When it was time to read the sweater in winter

24
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:26,930
You hear me?
-Yes, why?

25
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,980
January is not coming,
Do not buy new clothes?

26
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:32,300
Why waste this in our poor condition?
Want to spend money?

27
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,650
At least bring Gisara this winter

28
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,440
In regards to the guests will come
You bought a new sofa

29
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,550
This way you spend a lot
You can not do the same thing over and over again

30
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,800
What? Is it?

31
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,890
I see it coming here early in the morning

32
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,600
Let's leave it somewhere else

33
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,400
Please, father

34
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,920
I teach you a lot of trouble
I want to see the degree, and he's okay
It can not be kept here. Let's go now

35
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:17,550
I saw the girl again, my father would go home
Instead of shouting, we were talking about the previous blow

36
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,520
When the signal is seen, call it

37
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:32,440
Okay

38
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,050
We are all of traffic signals
Do not abide by this rule

39
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,350
Come on here

40
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:18,260
Hostage

41
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,980
It was Sunday, I was in the game

42
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,560
Hey do not hurry the bat
Do not you see

43
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,550
This, this, the car of that girl

44
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,680
Who do you want to meet

45
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,620
I'm here to meet a little girl
That girl has gone to America

46
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,270
This, that girl has gone to America

47
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:06,270
Father, father, father ...
-Thank you !!

48
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,390
What to do when parents go to America !!

49
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,470
For the first time you made the emergency question in life

50
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:17,260
If you go to America before you class ten pass
You have to get 80% marks then

51
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,780
You have to achieve a good rank in the emetate
You can also get scholarships from the fund

52
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:26,360
In this way, you have to pass the engineering and passing

53
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:29,340
Then passed the GDD
You can go to America

54
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,130
When my dad was saying
I could understand first

55
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,440
Later, I thought

56
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,050
If you have to go through these

57
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,870
I understand that this will not be possible by me

58
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,600
But I want to go to America

59
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,420
Even if she forgot that girl

60
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,500
America can not be forgotten

61
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,130
I started eating cigarettes to increase a little bit

62
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:48,280
I grew up in 16 years

63
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,530
In 18 years, the subject has been selected

64
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,220
At the age of 25, at the age of 25

65
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:56,690
I earned a degree in employment

66
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:23,180
You are very comfortable

67
00:08:23,185 --> 00:08:25,180
Wine, chickens and music

68
00:08:25,185 --> 00:08:27,180
If you do everything ...

69
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,840
What i do What i do

70
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,650
Hiding this secret thing

71
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:36,730
Do not be ashamed to steal from your own house?

72
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:40,420
Why do I have to shame? After drinking alcohol
Do not want to eat chips?

73
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:45,060
Is this what life is?
Why are you talking like this?

74
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,590
Where are you coming?

75
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,530
Neighbors shop was exhausted
So I came to Sanjay with cigarettes

76
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,400
He has arranged for us

77
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,650
And he did not do so
Because of his weakness

78
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,110
Everyone has weaknesses, buddy

79
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,950
You're crazy to go to America. You're crazy to go to America
Why do not you go to America?

80
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:04,530
With middle class people like us
So it is not easy to return to the forehead

81
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,720
Actually speaking the truth

82
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:12,090
Going to America according to your qualifications
It really will be a lot of trouble

83
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,920
How can your visa be canceled repeatedly?

84
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:21,610
In January, I was afraid

85
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,310
My name is Mohan Ranga

86
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,040
Sorry sir, your visa has been canceled

87
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:38,950
Two years ago I took some confidence

88
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,000
Hi, my name is Mohan Ranga

89
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:49,060
Cancel
Next generation

90
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,930
2 times after the cancellation
At the 3rd time I became Casualel

91
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,430


92
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,940


93
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,130
Sorry sir, your visa has been canceled

94
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,910
I became afraid, confident and casual

95
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,150
Still did not do any work

96
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,140
Now, how do you go?

97
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,900
Mother ...
I'll talk later

98
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:00,370
I got a visa, father

99
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,370
Apart from you, many people of this world

100
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,820
Seven shores have gone there

101
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:09,460
Why do you speak to me?
-The boy is jealous

102
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,410
I gave up hope for you
I'm not jealous

103
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:14,920
What do you mean, Uncle?

104
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:17,680
That is, like a fool-like thing, it works

105
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,650
You shut up

106
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,020
Tell me, how did you get a visa?

107
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:24,620
This is due to Sarojara mother

108
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,430
Saroja Madam? Who is he

109
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:28,150
Who was our neighbor !!

110
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,480
Did mean? Is not it now?

111
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:33,040
God's grace ...

112
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:46,370
His brothers and other relatives are there

113
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:52,780
They just came here
That's why suddenly it's going to be there again ... so I ...

114
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:56,040
You took the ticket like this !!

115
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,720
When are you going to take him?

116
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,760
Come on, mother
Come on, father

117
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,250
Hey come inside
-That's the mother

118
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,850
Come on, let's say this

119
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,370
I'll call you
-Let's get the phone out of time

120
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,970
Where's that ass?

121
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:15,740
My friend?

122
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,040
how many?
2 million taka

123
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,730
Honey
-10% have interest

124
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,950
How did you get
Did not take 12%

125
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,720
Why is that?
- My commission

126
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:27,650
You do not have to become emotional

127
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,220
Do you give me money?

128
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,660
I'll give it as a dollar
Let me get my job

129
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,190
I was there to reach them
They will arrange for me the job

130
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,860
Oma! These are the graves of Christians
Shamsabad Airport is also bigger than

131
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:55,810
The common people do not want to deliver the goods

132
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:58,810
And you're dead with the dead body !!
You're really great, brother

133
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:02,110
You are
-My name is Vilas

134
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,550
Relatives of their close relatives
Why do not you go there?

135
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:10,090
I do not like the funeral,
But I like this place ...

136
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:15,610
In America, such a hairpin or hairpin
Whatever the helicopter depends on the decision

137
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:18,070
I am MA .... Mohan Ranga

138
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:19,810
There is probably more left !!

139
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:23,090
You're just here for this reason?

140
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:26,280
When i wanted to come here
Anyway, I would have come

141
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:29,750
I liked your simplicity
I like you

142
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,040
How?
-Something simple ...

143
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:32,670
Mohan

144
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:34,080
Sir, sir, I'm coming

145
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:36,680
Said sir

146
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,210
You are cutting the India's ticket tomorrow?

147
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:45,430
What are you thinking

148
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,840
No, sir ... I got a job here
-Seven must be here

149
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:49,990


150
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:53,330
Congratulations, you got a job
Where do you party?

151
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,460
Where are the bars here?

152
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:06,140
Someone conveyed some things
He is not given as a reward !!!

153
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,020
What happened

154
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:09,930
It's all gone, brother

155
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:17,310
This, what do you want Places to stay here?
Shop to shop? Or the car to rotate?

156
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,300
I need a job except this, brother

157
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,280
What are you saying
I thought they would hire me

158
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:31,170
Many people do not go to India even when the mother dies
And why are you coming here with so much trouble?

159
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,890
I'll see after that, brother
Now my situation is very bad, brother

160
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:38,160
Please do not give me a job;
I can only trust you

161
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,390
There is so much to worry about
Do not look, brother

162
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,030
What? Could I find a job for him?

163
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,530
My boss is very tough
You can work with her, but ...

164
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,630
She is a bad guy

165
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:50,850
No problem, brother

166
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,980
I was drinking water, it seems to be tearing throat!
It's alcohol

167
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:02,820
Do not tell me before, brother

168
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,010


169
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:08,700
This brother, you did not want to stay in my room at night!

170
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:16,570
Hey brothers do not eat alcohol because of internal hardship
Is not going? - It seems like the brother

171
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,480
After that
What would be the situation like me and what?

172
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,040
That means?

173
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,990
I'm coming back

174
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,540
Ok brother

175
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,240


176
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,020


177
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:55,220
Megha police is coming in the same way
Hurry up

178
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:57,770


179
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,930


180
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:01,230


181
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:03,820


182
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,430
Fate did you break at the right time

183
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:09,220
I fell in the right time

184
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,580
Where is your problem

185
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:13,750
I need a job
Need a job

186
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:14,770
Where will I get you off?

187
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,970
That's where Uncle got me in the street
He left the middle and went away

188
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:18,810
Who is Uncle?

189
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,570
Sarojar's son

190
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,590
Who is Saroja?

191
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,550
He is someone important to someone's life

192
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:25,710
Where is the son's problem?
Stop the car

193
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:29,760
A little help

194
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:31,660
Hold him a little better

195
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,550
Megha, stay here
Let's go

196
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:03,480
Shit

197
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:05,510
He will die without water?

198
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,320
You see me more than that
A little more than that

199
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,620
Where are you all night?

200
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,440
Can you cut the night well?

201
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:40,800
Who was that girl?

202
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,650
After leaving the bar
I do not remember what happened

203
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,640


204
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,100
My boss is more terrible
lets go

205
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,410


206
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,940
Wants to take leave
Go away

207
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,420
Never face the office

208
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:57,900
It's wrong to come here in the morning!

209
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:59,180
How did he come to America?

210
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,560
Sir ... what is sir?

211
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,060
She said that her wife would be pregnant delivery
So he was coming here to seek the holidays

212
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:05,670
Did you get the holiday?

213
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,750
I have given a break

214
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:09,350
Sir, my friend, sir

215
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,010
Yesterday, and coming to America

216
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:13,210
New?

217
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,380
Absolutely new, sir

218
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:20,070
I'm telling you a short story
New York is a small town

219
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,650
Where's your birthplace?
-Hyderabad sir

220
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:31,730
Haidarabad

221
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:40,160
Here's Manhattan, Brooklyn
We like Jubilee and Bongari Hills

222
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:46,530
Think about our Chelsea
We also do a lot like this

223
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,240
Haidarabad sounds like a victory

224
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:52,550
Where were we?
We're here, sir

225
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:53,530
Where were we?

226
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:54,800
Chelsea, sir

227
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,820
Chelsea

228
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,460
What do you do with me

229
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:02,800
Sir, he's hoping for jobs here

230
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:04,150


231
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,850


232
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,340


233
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:12,890
Yes, sir

234
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,760


235
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:14,480


236
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:19,050
You do not have to come from 9 to 6 offices
You come to the office after 6 o'clock

237
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,740
Say brother

238
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,170
Sir, do not give a last resort !!

239
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,700
Do not see his number?
And the condition of his percussion !! Damn ...

240
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:34,100
I can trust her and give her a job
If he wants to work with $ 20000

241
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:36,430
20 thousand dollars?
Padua

242
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,070
We do not need it

243
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:41,130
Where will the money system?

244
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,750
Give me your phone, brother

245
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:04,280
You got a job, did you?
When are you sending money?

246
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:10,790
You have not already made a lot of money there?
Now, quickly send the loan money as a dollar

247
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:17,490
Why do not you say anything
Is everything okay?

248
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:23,860
In the United States, I see phalimane on the phone

249
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:35,470
Dad, what about you?

250
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:40,000
Do you have time to call now?
Your mother ended up speaking to you

251
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,390
Hamam

252
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:45,320
You did not ask so much, what is the reason for it
Do not tell me the phone

253
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:51,260
Actually, for visa processing
Taka 10 lakhs will be required

254
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:54,940
Do they not find the money?
What does this dream end then ??

255
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:01,780
If you need sympathy, call it
Do not call for millions or millions of dollars

256
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:07,890
I was happy at home. Such as in our house
The TV is free, you can keep it as well

257
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:12,120
I did not pay money, but did not say anything

258
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,360
what happened?

259
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:17,290
This thing will not sink on your head
It's about million rupees

260
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,260
The way you gave me coffee
I knew something was going to happen

261
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:38,800
Brother, I have money to stay here
There is no additional money

262
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:42,590
Please do not look for brothers once
Please ... please ... please

263
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:49,090
This is how my dad's friends like us do
Helps I talk to him on the phone

264
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,400
But do not expect much

265
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:51,200


266
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,180
Talk, brother, talk
Speak up

267
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,360
Wait brother

268
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:57,410


269
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:08,480
I have a friend from India
He wants to meet you

270
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:11,530
Okay

271
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:14,750
Brother ... What is he saying, brother?

272
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:20,300
Brother, he is going to India tomorrow
Here's a 5-hour journey from here

273
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:22,570
Come on, brother, come on
Come on, brother

274
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:26,300
Come on, brother ... -I will not go, you have to go
I have a lot of work here

275
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:27,800
You can go as low as possible, brother !!!

276
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,580
You're carpooling and going to the car

277
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:34,550
What does that mean, brother?

278
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:43,130
That means, to go from one city to another city
People also share in the car to save money
This is called car-pooling

279
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,120


280
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,580
Calculate how much money is coming

281
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:58,000
Why is it standing there?

282
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:01,700
To see the outer side
What's yours

283
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,320
Keep it

284
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:10,320
You help me a lot, brother
If I fall into a problem, a picture

285
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,640
Our Uncle was a lawyer before
He does not want to give easy opportunities, be careful

286
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:15,140
When will the vehicle come?

287
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,110
This is the way

288
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,010
Why is this beggar standing here?

289
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:27,180
This car?

290
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,270
may be
-Oke

291
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:36,520
where are you?

292
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,730
I'm here
Just got a car passed here

293
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:41,790
where are you?

294
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,980
Are you
-yes I'm

295
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,520
That boy ???
I am coming

296
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,250
You not You not

297
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,220
You ...

298
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:52,880
He was saying to let you die
Yesterday night you made me crazy

299
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:54,450
Yesterday night?

300
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,270
Look like this girl, brother

301
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:04,320
To say a lot? The mobile was broken!

302
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:10,490
Ah, how did that happen? Actually last night
After 3 glasses of alcohol, the head began to rotate

303
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,490
I do not remember what happened next

304
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,540
You can not go with me

305
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:14,950
Brother

306
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:18,890
Madam, I'm sorry for your legs

307
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,890
Please, ma'am
Forgive me

308
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:23,890
I did not really want to trouble you
I was not at all worried at that time

309
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,310
Do you think I'm a driver?

310
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:31,690
I will not make any other adulthood
I promise, I will not say anything

311
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:37,730
Although the boy is stupid but not dangerous
You can trust me

312
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:43,090
Come on

313
00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:00,030
Sir, I'm a friend of Villas; We started the journey
I'll get there within 5 hours, sir

314
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:05,680


315
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:06,910


316
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:10,870
What kind of music do you like

317
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:13,970
Madam

318
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,800


319
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,900
Is there a beep song?

320
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:18,670
Mean?

321
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,190
Got it

322
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,350
Is this madam?

323
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:37,970
Opera

324
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:40,750
Will i turn off

325
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,920
no need...

326
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,660
Stay away ...

327
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:05,850
This opera song brought your sleep !!

328
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,580
Now there is a lot of freshness

329
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,480
Where have we reached now?

330
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:13,650
We're still here

331
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:17,290
Madam, do not tell me
It's a matter of my life

332
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:18,420
The guy with me sleepy
I can not drive

333
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,830
Never sleep in life anymore
Please, madam, walk fast

334
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:23,820
Increase Madam Speed ​​Increase
Please, ma'am

335
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:27,370
I'm on 100 speed, okay?

336
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:29,560
That sounds like, Madam

337
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:30,410
Okay so

338
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,360
An ambulance car is coming
The car is kept side-by-side

339
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,180
Why did you stop the car?

340
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,730


341
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,080


342
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:52,000
Madam, you give all your IDs right

343
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,970
If you have everything right
Then you can go

344
00:32:54,130 --> 00:33:02,090


345
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:05,790
The car will be here, complaining to the police station
If you register, you can get back the car

346
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:24,610


347
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:28,110


348
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:29,610
That means ...

349
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:32,070
I know what to do now !!!

350
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:35,060
Hello, sir
I am saying

351
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:36,750
Yes, say
Are you coming

00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:40,670
Sir, I have read the entire traffic jam
I'll get in 2 hours, sir

353
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:46,590


354
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,280


355
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:54,240


356
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,270
Are you angry with me

357
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,400
What's the rugby?

358
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,230
No, you're late for me

359
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:07,230
To be honest, it is like this with me
What else can you do there !!!

360
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,230
Actually on my forehead ...

361
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:11,910


362
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:21,350
I looked at you,
There is no match with you in America

363
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,050
How are you coming here

364
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:23,430
I'm here to deliver a thing

365
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:24,590
What?

366
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:28,920
Saroja is a very important person in my life
He advised me as I was a child

367
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:30,030
What advice

368
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:35,340
It does not even have time or place to tell it
I'll tell you later

369
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:37,360
What is your name?

370
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:39,180
Megha ... Megha Subramaniam

371
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:39,840
Mega

372
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:44,420
Mega not ... Mega ... will be a blow
Tell me

373
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:46,830
Megha ... Subramaniam Madam

374
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:49,940
your name

375
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:53,400
There is no dimension of Mohan Ranga
Can easily say

376
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:10,180
It's too late
What do you do now

377
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:13,220


378
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,580


379
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,680


380
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:17,910
I'll break.

381
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,750


382
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,260
Hello
How long will it take?

383
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:45,310
It takes another hour

384
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:47,580
There is no knowledge in you, ass

385
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,300
He is angry

386
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:51,260


387
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:59,870


388
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,660
It's been too late
What can I do now !!

389
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:05,940
If this happens then it will not work

390
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:08,190
What can i do now

391
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:13,650
Madam, what is this?

392
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,800
This is my shirt

393
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:17,220
I have a lot of fun with it
I will not give it at all

394
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:18,590
Megha Madam

395
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,610
Come on, stand up

396
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:21,140
What?

397
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,330
After coming here so far
If not managed for an hour

398
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:27,330
I do not get the job
My life will end

399
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:28,330
Please

400
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:30,290
Take it

401
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:44,190
how do you feel?

402
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:45,480
Looks like Sunny Leone's sister

403
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:49,440
You're lying to keep my mind
Well let's go

404
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:56,200
What do you do now

405
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:05,100
Sir, I'm a friend of Villas

406
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,520


407
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:23,150
E-Marx is not good at school or college
Even the engineering and not

408
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,190
There is nothing to know about time between you

409
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:32,440
See the senses on your shirt
My breathing is coming off

410
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,440
Tell me a reason

411
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:41,050
Why ... why should I sponsor for you?
Show me a reason

412
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:44,550
Show me a reason ... why am I
Going to sponsor for you ???

413
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:49,150
Uncle, I want to talk to you

414
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:49,940
Tell me

415
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:53,320
What you are saying is 200% OK, Uncle;
I think so about him.

416
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:56,320
Today I know him well, Uncle

417
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,690
And you know how to come to America?
Come to deliver a goods

418
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,600
I also looked at him like this

419
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:07,600
Uncle likes him like a thief?
I felt that

420
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,240
And my shirt is lying, Uncle

421
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:12,240
A man collided with a coffee shirt
This shirt changed and changed

422
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,850
Nowadays, between boys and girls
There is no difference, Uncle

423
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:19,850
Someone like me in my life
And I did not see, Uncle

424
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:24,030
You will also go to India, I will also go away;
But this boy will be here

425
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:26,030
Believe me, Uncle

426
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:33,300
Coming from India so far
Give him a chance

427
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,730
For your decision this lifetime
Be very happy

428
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,270
I do not like this boy

429
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:45,270
But I like your words

430
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,270
I'll help him for you

431
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,080


432
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:50,770
Give check book

433
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:10,360
Take this

434
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,640
Why do you cry like a baby?

435
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:21,370
Why cry?

436
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,680
Hello

437
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:28,990
Nobody ever helped me in my life
Even my dad is not

438
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:35,730
Megha Madam, I agree to do anything to you
You are as great as a goddess to me

439
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:36,850
Get up

440
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,460
Get up

441
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,520
Hey up

442
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:55,610
Say Megha Madam
What can I do for you?

443
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,230
Can you say yes

444
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:58,220
Can i

445
00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:00,480
When I say you have to say yes 3 times

446
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:02,650
3 times i will say 10 times

447
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:08,080
Change this shirt before
Look strange to see you

448
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:10,590
Why are you coming here?

449
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:14,730


450
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,930


451
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:21,550
I wanted to meet you;
Your mother was talking a lot about you

452
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,700


453
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:24,840


454
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,100


455
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,600
Yes

456
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:42,620
You made it clear before marriage
Come on, brother, we talk about the matter of the cloud

457
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,050
He did not come to talk to you

458
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:53,210
Yes

459
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:55,170
Then why are you coming here?

460
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,400
He's coming to kill you

461
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,610
You kill me

462
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:05,580
You kill me

463
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:07,480
Yes

464
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:08,510
You ...

465
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:19,790
You look like a normal girl
Getting me in place

466
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:22,790
Just by saying yes to me
You wanted to survive marriage?

467
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:29,320
What is that boy Any girl else
Even after watching with his son, he has no objection

468
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,320
I do not like him

469
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:33,930
That day and I came to meet me
Just at midnight

470
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:42,080
That's why I came so far with you
So that all of your words end

471
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:46,800
Well he was caught, our work
When you're done, cut off from here

472
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:47,800
Let's go to this point

473
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,300
I'm very tired

474
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:19,190
Mega

475
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,680
I did not tell you

476
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:26,240
The blow ... only the blow, Megha Madam

477
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:20,660


478
00:46:22,330 --> 00:46:22,930


479
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:24,970
We will meet again later

480
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:50,660
When are you coming from India?

481
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,120
What is that boy

482
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,360
I phoned

483
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:55,980
Have you met son?

484
00:46:57,670 --> 00:46:58,670
How is daddy

485
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:01,860
What am I asking you?
And what are you saying !!

486
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:03,260
Am I wrong?

487
00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:07,320
Megha, can we talk seriously?

488
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:08,950
Go to college

489
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,020
Come and talk
Flo, let's go

490
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:16,240
God, nothing will happen in this way

491
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:19,660
It will work with this

492
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,660
Do not be so happy about it

493
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:25,660
Here are two lakh applicants in this way
From there, 1000 people were selected

494
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:27,450
If you're in the park
Then be happy

495
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:33,980
Padua

496
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,480
You will not understand

497
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:38,900
Megha, more with aunty
Do not talk patiently quietly?

498
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:40,040


499
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:41,630
One minute
Hello

500
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,440
I was just thinking of you in the cloud

501
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:00,780
Oh well, why?

502
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:03,490
Just got out of the car with a boss
You used to drive the same vehicle

503
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:04,940
I was thinking of you

504
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:07,340
Why is that?

505
00:48:07,490 --> 00:48:09,880
Here's a girl's dress
That's a boy

506
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:13,050
Has been ... ... and will not have to be ashamed

507
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:15,470
So

508
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:17,260
So

509
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,440
Will meet

510
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,400
Are you thinking so seriously?

511
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:34,760
What do you think? Life is so
I got stuck in the middle

512
00:48:35,090 --> 00:48:36,090
Tell me in Telugu

513
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:42,370
Did you check Are you visas
Did you get it or not? Do not worry about those things

514
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,210
If you do not have any advantage here
Work in India

515
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:46,210
The work is the same everywhere

516
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:49,670
If you are given more money here
So you will not be here?

517
00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:52,020
Well, what do you do if you make a lot of money?

518
00:48:54,470 --> 00:48:57,640
Buy a good car
Make a big house

519
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:58,560
After that

520
00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:02,870
What else? That girl would give her dowry well
I will marry a girl

521
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:04,230
Will you marry dowry?

522
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:06,540
Not for me, kids
Not safe for a secure future?

523
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:07,750
If the girl is impractical to see

524
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:09,140
I will use lifeboys

525
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,200
If the girl is arrogant

526
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:11,230
I'll adjust

527
00:49:11,790 --> 00:49:15,090
Seriously you do not really need a girl
You need an ATM card

528
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:16,650
As you said, I will not do anything

529
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:21,070
For boys like you
No girl will come in a minute

530
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:23,840
The way I like it, I love it

531
00:49:24,110 --> 00:49:28,270
Talking to you is not a job
You're a male-dominated arrogant boy

532
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:31,030
Stop talking about it
I tell you one thing

533
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:33,780
I like you just like you

534
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:37,360
I like that, I like to be like that

535
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,970
I'm hungry
Can you eat?

536
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:45,550
Today not tomorrow
Come to my house to eat at noon

537
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:46,870


538
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,670
Big House, brother

539
00:49:52,770 --> 00:49:55,980
Your language and body language
Try to control both

540
00:49:56,570 --> 00:49:57,240
Sorry, brother

541
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:58,680
Do you have to come or not?

542
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:04,200
Many days later brother ...

543
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:06,230
Come on, brother

544
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:21,310
Are you South Indian food?

545
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:29,120
My mother is also born in Hyderabad
My mother loves hyderabad very much

546
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:33,630
Where are you staying in Hyderabad?
Jubilee Hills, Aunty

547
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:36,690
Oh!!! Great ...

548
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:39,040
And where are you staying?

549
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:40,520
Amirpate, Aunty

550
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:41,970
Oh, great

551
00:50:45,090 --> 00:50:46,370
What does your father do?

552
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:47,730
Industrialist, aunty

553
00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:50,390
Oh!!! Great

554
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:53,750
What does your father do?

555
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:56,010
He is a little employer

556
00:50:57,980 --> 00:50:58,530
Oh, great

557
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:08,400
Your mother's wonderful style
I feel really great

558
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,870
Did you say something

559
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:11,760
The pizza is very funny, aunty

560
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:13,390
Dessert is more delicious

561
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:20,270
You seem to be a very good friend
Just tell him a little

562
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:22,620
How well does that boy know?

563
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:26,360


564
00:51:27,330 --> 00:51:28,870
Tell me a little more about the cloud

565
00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:30,070
What is that boy, aunty?

566
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:31,370
He's a jockey

567
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:34,150
Jockey means radio jockey, aunty?

568
00:51:34,170 --> 00:51:38,780
No, he's got horses, horses can run
He's a jockey

569
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:39,970
I love horses very much

570
00:51:40,410 --> 00:51:42,350
Oh, do you like it?
I also like

571
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:44,980
Hand nails, brother !!

572
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,670
Mother, mr and jockey

573
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:00,140

574
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:02,910

00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:04,340
Oh!!! Great

576
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:06,420
He's a jockey from six

577
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:08,980
You are so fortunate, Megha
Six from jockey

578
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,090
Aunty, madhu jockey

579
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:13,730
no brother
I am not jockey

580
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:15,740
I see brother
You too jockey

581
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:19,180
What is aunty uncle and jockey?

582
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:22,850
Hey, he's a VIP person
He has no time to do these things

583
00:52:24,450 --> 00:52:25,450
Why are you so laughing?

584
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:32,060
Jockey means that, brother
I still did not understand that

585
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:36,540
Megha, the food is fairly good
Having a good time with your mom

586
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:37,210
Yes

587
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:38,240
Are you thinking so much

588
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:44,720
No, Mom is here also on this holiday
Marriage will make me annoy me

589
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:45,720
I do not understand what to do now

590
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:48,730
What do you think of these days?
Will you go somewhere out of here?

591
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:49,860
That will not happen

592
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:50,840
Yes

593
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:53,760
I do not have any money

594
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:54,990
All costs are on my behalf

595
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:53,590
This is my gift

596
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:55,880
Why is that? Now I do not drink alcohol

597
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,160
Hey, it's not for a long time to eat
It's memory to catch the happiness of life

598
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:01,350
Do you have any lover

599
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,040
Did not you like anyone

600
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:09,180
There is no one to waste time here
Here someone will spend hours talking?

601
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,200
That's right

602
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:24,130
Megha, roaming outside without telling me
What happens if something goes wrong?

603
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:27,640
If you do not want to
If you wanna marry you?

604
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:06,870
Nice weather with brother, great song
Excellent wine bottle, let's have fun

605
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:11,450
It's not for eating, brother
I just remember

606
00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:19,920
Mohan Ranga

607
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:22,100
Oh no, Mohana Ragam

608
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:25,890
I thought, that's the name of the boy
- I understand it!

609
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:29,310
What are you doing

610
00:57:32,170 --> 00:57:34,620
What are you doing

611
00:57:35,730 --> 00:57:41,090
What are you doing

612
00:57:43,870 --> 00:57:47,130
Let's meet us?

613
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,670
I want to tell him
How much i love him

614
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:13,770
Brother, Mega wants to meet me
If you ask about yourself, you are busy

615
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:14,790
why brother?

616
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:17,510
Because, I want to meet him alone
What do you do there?

617
00:58:40,690 --> 00:58:42,150
Megha is great, my brother

618
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:44,360
I want to spend some time with him

619
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:48,910
In fact I have never said
I did not see him like that

620
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:49,910
When did I lose myself?

621
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,060
You're not going to go a little further, brother?

622
00:58:52,270 --> 00:58:56,320
How long will it be, brother? And if you say so
He likes me too, so it's been done

623
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:59,950
His life is completely different with you
How do you match them?

624
00:59:02,270 --> 00:59:03,270
Here's the set, brother?

625
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:09,450
It would not be like finding a match in life with the car
If the car is bad, you can leave it on the road

626
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:11,670
But life is not the same, brother

627
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:15,020
She is still trying to manage herself
It will be its own satellite before

628
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:19,020
The speed of his own life is right or not
How to live with you?

629
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:21,400
And that's not the way, brother

630
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:26,140
Brother, you think about marriage with Megha

631
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:29,140
But before thinking of that, your own life
Have to set up, make good money

632
00:59:29,550 --> 00:59:32,010
Not only do I say that
You will feel it yourself too

633
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:38,780
You do not even listen to Auntie
Again she does not want to marry her

634
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:41,780
Whichever you like, you are in India
We have to go back

635
00:59:42,130 --> 00:59:46,930
But there is no thought in her life
So think about how you will live the future

636
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:50,630
I told you what I think
But the rest will understand your own

637
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:13,790
The girl who loves you like you
He'll leave you in a minute

638
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:30,320
I like you as you like
You also have to like me like me ...

639
01:01:57,540 --> 01:02:01,090
You're right, brother
I did not go

640
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:05,980
I did not even have a phone

641
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:08,980
I'm calling once

642
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:13,440
Hello
- Come to the Argentine office

643
01:02:15,890 --> 01:02:17,430
This guy called in the wrong time

644
01:02:26,350 --> 01:02:26,880


645
01:02:28,110 --> 01:02:34,480
Poverty in your life is a big problem
Your money is also seen in earning

646
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:37,110
You get US visas and disappointments

647
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:39,220
Did you know anything about change?

648
01:02:39,770 --> 01:02:41,780
I give you a job
That's my forehead

649
01:02:50,530 --> 01:02:51,530


650
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:53,950
I'm coming soon

651
01:03:55,530 --> 01:03:58,250
Degree also ended
What do you do now

652
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:00,600
I'm waiting for some time

653
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:08,830
I just know, the megha has gone to India

654
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:19,870
Will I call a call tomorrow?

655
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:24,900
Do not need, brother; With this matter
I have no relation

656
01:04:39,830 --> 01:04:40,940
Your phone is coming to you?

657
01:04:41,090 --> 01:04:42,470
I thought you gave me a call

658
01:04:44,090 --> 01:04:46,470
And he did not give me once and phone

659
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:47,820
Well, Ricky

660
01:04:53,610 --> 01:04:54,470


661
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:55,560
What is your sister doing

662
01:04:56,100 --> 01:05:00,520
Yesterday was sitting silently
Do not know what you're doing today, you know?

663
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,100
Like Ramaiah Krishnan of Narsimha Cinema
She kept quietly locking herself in the house

664
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,100
Tell him to walk a little outside

665
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:06,980
Well, father

666
01:05:12,530 --> 01:05:12,930


667
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:18,340
As I thought
You're doing more than that

668
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:20,370


669
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:28,880
You told me, but he is
Do not tell me, she likes me?

670
01:05:30,210 --> 01:05:31,210
Who is he

671
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:41,580
Wine is fun to eat fresh fresh
But having fun is also fun to eat

672
01:05:42,890 --> 01:05:43,890
Do not you believe
you see

673
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:57,730
I love this song very much

674
01:05:58,390 --> 01:06:02,140
This song is not written by any son, these heroine did not write a boy, these heroine
Wrote to give to Wilen

675
01:06:03,170 --> 01:06:06,870
Apu fell in love with someone in America
That's why it's so annoying

676
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:08,970
shut up

677
01:06:16,970 --> 01:06:21,650
Tell your friend to eat properly
She is going to get married in front of him

678
01:06:27,530 --> 01:06:30,300
Come on, all of us
I am promoting MKK

679
01:06:30,490 --> 01:06:31,490


680
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:16,870
Chintoo can not do this, Apa

681
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:18,950
Eat this chicken lilypopa

682
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:56,560
Mom, what are these?

683
01:10:57,370 --> 01:10:59,400


684
01:11:00,510 --> 01:11:01,390


685
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:05,040
What's your problem

686
01:11:05,180 --> 01:11:07,940
I have no problem,
You and my mom have problems

687
01:11:12,790 --> 01:11:13,460
Anger

688
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:14,840
What are you writing
What are you writing

689
01:11:16,710 --> 01:11:17,490
Curiosity

690
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:24,740
What are you doing
What are you saying you are writing?

691
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:27,250


692
01:11:28,570 --> 01:11:29,570
You can go

693
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:40,670
Doctor, I have no problem

694
01:11:41,060 --> 01:11:42,670
Actually I'm very good

695
01:11:43,660 --> 01:11:47,670
What are you writing And what do you think?
It does not matter to me

696
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:54,310


697
01:11:56,860 --> 01:11:57,860
You can go

698
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:05,820
I have no problem
My girlfriend has problems

699
01:12:05,860 --> 01:12:06,860
what's the problem?

700
01:12:06,940 --> 01:12:09,210
Actually, with a boy a few days ago
Visited America

701
01:12:09,340 --> 01:12:12,210
The girl fell in love with the boy

702
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:16,120
I do not know that girl
Whether that boy likes at all !!

703
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:20,120
But one day they wanted to meet both of them

704
01:12:20,740 --> 01:12:22,010
The girl did not meet her

705
01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:25,010
That's why he blames himself

706
01:12:26,130 --> 01:12:30,170
He seems to be the son of what he really is
Is a good boy for him!

707
01:12:30,610 --> 01:12:31,610
Is not that right?

708
01:12:33,110 --> 01:12:34,110
So this is your problem?

709
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:35,710
Not mine, my girlfriend

710
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:36,680
Got it

711
01:12:37,430 --> 01:12:38,080
You can go

712
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:38,610
What?

713
01:12:38,830 --> 01:12:40,710
You can go, Miss Mega Subramaniam

714
01:12:42,330 --> 01:12:43,330
The problem is solved

715
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:48,150
Yes, Mitra

01:12:48,510 --> 01:12:52,420
Mrs. Subramaniam, and stay in America
Love a boy

717
01:12:52,750 --> 01:12:53,110
Oh really?

718
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,170


719
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:00,920
The cloud

720
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:06,050
Do you love someone in America?

721
01:13:06,290 --> 01:13:07,530
who is saying? who is saying?

722
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:08,680
Dr. Mitra is saying

723
01:13:09,090 --> 01:13:12,970
He is crazy I'm not about him
I told about Ashour

724
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:15,660
So, do not you have any problem?

725
01:13:15,940 --> 01:13:16,940
I have no problem

726
01:13:18,650 --> 01:13:20,540
Is there any information?

727
01:13:20,870 --> 01:13:21,490
Look at

728
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:39,320


729
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:45,440
But listen

730
01:13:46,470 --> 01:13:48,730


731
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:50,200


732
01:13:50,540 --> 01:13:56,540
Bad words, do not you understand?
Have you been shocked? Look at my office

733
01:13:56,930 --> 01:13:59,780
She is due to the real success of my office

734
01:14:00,950 --> 01:14:02,120
Do you know that

735
01:14:02,210 --> 01:14:02,860
No, sir

736
01:14:03,730 --> 01:14:06,620
Because my divorce is no longer
He's got a breakup

737
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:08,150


738
01:14:10,390 --> 01:14:15,730
When the girl goes to life, the focus does not go away
Rather, it continued to rocket speed

739
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:17,710
Hold it

740
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:22,420
What are you doing online so much night?
Delete the massage before returning home

741
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:25,070
After eating cigarettes, keep the face fresh
Mouth Fresh had to be used

742
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:29,510
They can not do anything in our lives
That's our success

743
01:14:29,670 --> 01:14:31,860
Listen to your great speech
I want to say something

744
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:34,870
Hey, tell me, I doubt it

745
01:14:36,220 --> 01:14:37,530
Have i become like you

746
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:38,490
Of course

747
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:39,720
Sir
-Thank you

748
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:40,360
Brother

749
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:43,470
Am I curious like him?

750
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:44,980
Wine is eating too much, sir

751
01:14:45,010 --> 01:14:49,000
I'm like him? Lucky like him?
Suddenly like him?

752
01:14:49,110 --> 01:14:50,110


753
01:14:52,430 --> 01:14:56,330
I have become like you
I do not want you to become like me

754
01:14:57,180 --> 01:14:58,180
Listen

755
01:15:03,790 --> 01:15:09,820
I understand the brother well
If there is no lover in life

756
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:11,470
Then life will be like this donkey

757
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:12,740
What are you saying this

758
01:15:13,820 --> 01:15:14,820
Brother

759
01:15:14,890 --> 01:15:16,300
Get out the shirt first

760
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:18,380
Giving the glass, sir

761
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:19,400


762
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:21,280
Hurry hurry

763
01:15:25,970 --> 01:15:33,240
If you want any girlfriend in life
Then change your attitude before

764
01:15:34,410 --> 01:15:40,270
They are not just fun or money for us
Love us from your heart

765
01:15:41,220 --> 01:15:44,420
This country is not right ... okay

766
01:15:47,580 --> 01:15:49,330
What is the benefit of the life of a monk?

767
01:15:49,580 --> 01:15:54,330
Now, what is the success of this?

768
01:15:55,740 --> 01:15:58,720
Now I'm absolutely sure

769
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:00,180
what happened?

770
01:16:06,060 --> 01:16:08,740
Nobody else would have to say about this

771
01:16:15,050 --> 01:16:17,000
Do you know what you doing?

772
01:16:17,150 --> 01:16:18,150
I know

773
01:16:18,430 --> 01:16:20,250
Do you know what has happened in this 1 year?

774
01:16:22,690 --> 01:16:23,490
Brother ...

775
01:16:23,590 --> 01:16:24,630
She may be divorced and become involved

776
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:26,250
May have a baby

777
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:28,120
Maybe it can die

778
01:16:28,580 --> 01:16:31,650
If he dies
I will go to heaven with him

779
01:16:32,410 --> 01:16:33,410
But i have to go

780
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:50,340


781
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:51,600
What are you doing here

782
01:16:51,730 --> 01:16:53,660
I came here to leave Mardavi here
What are you doing here

783
01:16:53,690 --> 01:16:55,470
I'm coming to lower the MKK
He is going to India

784
01:16:55,550 --> 01:16:57,670
What is the magic period of that day?

785
01:16:57,750 --> 01:16:59,670
There was nothing at that time of Mayan's time

786
01:16:59,960 --> 01:17:00,960
Did you come

787
01:17:03,390 --> 01:17:04,390
Did not you come

788
01:17:05,310 --> 01:17:08,170
For an emergency work that day
I could not even come in the cloud

789
01:17:10,150 --> 01:17:10,920
You came

790
01:17:10,940 --> 01:17:16,460
I was too busy working in the office
We could not even go to meet that monthly target

791
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:19,450
See the end of the office work

792
01:17:33,980 --> 01:17:37,970
At the end of the long tour, I reached

793
01:17:42,250 --> 01:17:43,990
That red jeep

794
01:17:50,830 --> 01:17:52,430
Here's the influential people
Where is most likely?

795
01:17:54,390 --> 01:17:55,390
In the gym

796
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:04,240
Of that village ...

797
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:07,110
Where is the hill area here?
T-Estate

798
01:18:31,630 --> 01:18:33,630
Where is the VIP people home?

799
01:19:18,350 --> 01:19:20,580
Where is the girl? It's coming, Uncle

800
01:19:21,010 --> 01:19:22,010
Babu carefully

801
01:19:22,060 --> 01:19:23,700
Give the cyan phone

802
01:19:23,930 --> 01:19:24,930
Do not give it

803
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:37,870
Give me the phone

804
01:19:46,430 --> 01:19:48,560
I'm on your feet, Madam
Please, ma'am

805
01:21:56,990 --> 01:21:58,590
My friend, are you?

806
01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:01,710
Call me a good phone call !!!

807
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:16,720
It has to be with me
I can not bear this scene, buddy

808
01:22:20,910 --> 01:22:24,590
This, this, what did I do here?

809
01:22:24,990 --> 01:22:28,060
You hit his mother with a car
The marriage has broken

810
01:22:36,750 --> 01:22:39,670
Oh!!! Great

811
01:22:41,180 --> 01:22:42,180
Speak the real

812
01:22:43,050 --> 01:22:46,780
At the last moment when I brought Mangalam
Then this happened to happen

813
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:50,240
His feet were seriously injured
One week is saying to rest

814
01:22:50,390 --> 01:22:51,390
Who hit the road with the car?

815
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:53,100
He's there

816
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:10,580
How many times have I called you?
Why did not you call the phone?

817
01:23:10,910 --> 01:23:11,460
What happened

818
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:14,710
I did not think that I was guilty of not going on that day?
Actually he did not come there

819
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:17,240
Who are you?

820
01:23:17,390 --> 01:23:20,350
Did anyone say I believed?
Vilas E says to me

821
01:23:20,980 --> 01:23:21,990
Well, Ricky

822
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:38,640
What is your mother now

823
01:23:39,250 --> 01:23:42,610
Still the situation is not good, it may be better
So what can I say?

824
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:47,710
He's crazy!

825
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:48,880
Do not miss anything

826
01:23:49,170 --> 01:23:51,860
Carry on irresponsibly
Who is his fractured ass?

827
01:23:52,130 --> 01:23:52,620
That boy

828
01:23:57,440 --> 01:23:58,440
Here, why are you here?

829
01:24:00,610 --> 01:24:01,610
Sir, why are you here?

830
01:24:01,990 --> 01:24:02,990
For marriage

831
01:24:04,170 --> 01:24:05,900
You're actually great

832
01:24:06,070 --> 01:24:09,900
For anyone else's marriage in life
I have not seen coming so far

833
01:24:10,110 --> 01:24:13,120
I had to come here
My son is getting married

834
01:24:14,730 --> 01:24:16,670
I did not tell you that day,
My girl is liked.

835
01:24:19,750 --> 01:24:22,380
Sir, the time to look for the patient is over
Everyone goes outside

836
01:25:05,980 --> 01:25:07,490
Who is this home?

837
01:25:07,830 --> 01:25:08,510
That girl

838
01:25:09,070 --> 01:25:09,760
And this flower?

839
01:25:10,470 --> 01:25:11,160
For her ass

840
01:25:11,350 --> 01:25:12,350
Why are you?

841
01:25:12,620 --> 01:25:13,570
Say sorry

842
01:25:13,670 --> 01:25:14,670
The girl is not the mother?

843
01:25:18,190 --> 01:25:18,980
Come on, come on

844
01:25:19,540 --> 01:25:20,540
I have to go?

845
01:25:21,150 --> 01:25:24,220
Are you a friend of mine or Pammy?

846
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:26,290
Well, buddy

847
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:33,160
Why is this boy coming here?

848
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:36,280
Sir, come to see Auntie

849
01:25:47,420 --> 01:25:51,860
Anyone else can not drive properly
Wounded !! If I was, I would have killed you

850
01:25:51,950 --> 01:25:52,950
To kill?

851
01:25:58,650 --> 01:26:01,900
Apa, I do not think this will happen at this time

852
01:26:04,990 --> 01:26:06,650
Apa, this boy did the accident

853
01:26:08,730 --> 01:26:11,060


854
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:15,230
Everyone looks very sad

855
01:26:15,250 --> 01:26:15,890
Will not you?

856
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:17,960
What are you doing

857
01:26:18,810 --> 01:26:19,590
I'm pretty satelier

858
01:26:19,710 --> 01:26:22,590
Make a good money, I have my own car
Just as I wanted

859
01:26:23,260 --> 01:26:31,790
There's a house like yours ... there
There are many aunts ... so this is my card

860
01:26:31,970 --> 01:26:32,970
If ever it is !!!

861
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:34,360
What are you doing here

862
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:37,520
Here, aunty?

863
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:38,220
Here

864
01:26:39,860 --> 01:26:41,380
Come to see marriage
-Yes, right

865
01:26:41,590 --> 01:26:43,960
If she wished to see a wedding, then on the street
What was the cause of the accident?

866
01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:45,720
It was definitely stuck due to traffic

867
01:26:45,780 --> 01:26:47,130
What is the accident with traffic?

868
01:26:48,150 --> 01:26:49,320
He does not want to do it

869
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:50,030
You eat tea

870
01:26:51,140 --> 01:26:52,870
Crazy, i just eat coffee

871
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:57,950
Aunty, where is the cloud?

872
01:26:58,050 --> 01:27:00,950
No, I went to the station to bring sister to me

873
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:04,670
Well, aunty, I'll come
There is a lot of work here

874
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:17,790
Say back to the wedding date
I posted to Facebook ...

875
01:27:17,860 --> 01:27:19,790
Do not like the post you did!

876
01:27:20,170 --> 01:27:23,230
Sorry sir, my marriage stopped because of me

877
01:27:23,330 --> 01:27:25,510
There is no problem

878
01:27:26,330 --> 01:27:27,510
Why are you here today?

879
01:27:28,330 --> 01:27:31,510
Do you just come here to see ani?

880
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:36,170
You're okay, that's the emergency

881
01:27:37,470 --> 01:27:41,240
There was a lot of money spent on this event

882
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:43,140
I have no hesitation in spending those expenses

883
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:47,140
But I have a little doubt

884
01:27:48,530 --> 01:27:52,090
Here as the guest
You can come

885
01:27:53,460 --> 01:27:57,290
Are you coming to love for some reason?

886
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:02,130
You rest

887
01:28:06,940 --> 01:28:07,940
Rest

888
01:28:09,070 --> 01:28:10,810
Sir, how did you understand?

889
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:14,000
The girl's mother's face for the situation is in her face
No kind of remorse is seen

890
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:16,000
Have you seen his face?

891
01:28:19,380 --> 01:28:22,260
His eyes are looking for something else

892
01:28:27,580 --> 01:28:29,560
Seeing the problem, he also called the phone

893
01:28:45,090 --> 01:28:46,030
Yes, say

894
01:28:46,050 --> 01:28:48,510
What are you brother I have called so many times

895
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:50,070
Tell me the real thing, brother

896
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:53,680
If you go to India even after looking for that girl
But that girl did not come to meet that day

897
01:28:53,710 --> 01:28:55,200
Who are you saying

898
01:28:55,350 --> 01:28:57,640
What did I believe if someone else said?
I told you soon, brother

899
01:28:57,790 --> 01:28:58,630
What are you saying

900
01:28:58,650 --> 01:29:01,600
I also said we could not go

901
01:29:01,620 --> 01:29:04,580
You're working very hard, brother

902
01:29:24,340 --> 01:29:25,040
Tell me

903
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:25,770
Tell me

904
01:29:25,890 --> 01:29:26,890
Why did not you come that day?

905
01:29:27,390 --> 01:29:28,390
Actually that day

906
01:29:28,410 --> 01:29:30,640
I say, you are actually a selfish man

907
01:29:31,430 --> 01:29:33,120
You only need a car, house for yourself

908
01:29:33,430 --> 01:29:37,120
Your feelings are only important to them
That's your purpose, I did not understand

909
01:29:38,470 --> 01:29:41,580
Well, that's okay
Then why did not you come?

910
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:43,480
I will say

911
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:44,850
You're actually a runaway man

912
01:29:45,160 --> 01:29:46,340
You want to escape from everything

913
01:29:46,570 --> 01:29:48,800
That day you told me yes yes
You want to save yourself

914
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:50,060
When I came to talk to you

915
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:52,060
You got away from there

916
01:29:52,780 --> 01:29:54,400
You really do not know how to make a stand

917
01:29:54,780 --> 01:29:56,400
You're a crazy and runaway man

918
01:29:56,510 --> 01:29:57,510


919
01:30:00,820 --> 01:30:03,430
The platform ticket has been cut
I'll also see it

920
01:30:09,390 --> 01:30:13,040

Please talk to me
It seems that there will be no work

925
01:30:38,820 --> 01:30:41,690
Without such a boy, except these
There is no work

926
01:30:42,740 --> 01:30:44,200
This, will you come or not?

927
01:31:00,900 --> 01:31:02,160
Who is calling me

928
01:31:02,390 --> 01:31:05,020
What are you doing here

929
01:31:05,180 --> 01:31:06,970

01:31:07,140 --> 01:31:08,560

932
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:21,270
No, no one has called you

933
01:31:24,050 --> 01:31:25,050
Talk with respect

934
01:31:26,530 --> 01:31:28,020

939
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:46,330
Yes, brother

946
01:32:02,030 --> 01:32:04,060
Boys can not walk on the streets peacefully?

947
01:32:10,020 --> 01:32:11,580
How do boys excite boys?

948
01:32:11,780 --> 01:32:12,390
What?

949
01:32:12,420 --> 01:32:14,170
How do boys excite boys?

950
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:19,230
I do not have much time
You all have come together and attacked

951
01:32:19,810 --> 01:32:21,870
Are you serious?

952
01:32:22,190 --> 01:32:24,460
Why do you think
Am I comedy here?

953
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:45,920

01:32:48,270 --> 01:32:51,340
Did you say that !!!

955
01:32:51,510 --> 01:32:52,510
What is that?

956
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:55,960
Come on here

957
01:32:56,770 --> 01:32:57,570
Yes, brother

958
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:02,260
Where do you want to go ... where to come?

959
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:05,030
Where do you want to go?

960
01:33:23,210 --> 01:33:24,630
You have delayed the bath and I have cleaned the bath

961
01:33:24,660 --> 01:33:25,660
Oh whatever

962
01:33:35,210 --> 01:33:37,710
Send 4 great wishers

963
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:39,360
Sorry sir, not now

964
01:33:39,530 --> 01:33:41,160
What? Try it

965
01:33:41,190 --> 01:33:41,620
Sorry, sir

966
01:33:53,850 --> 01:33:54,850
What is the bat

967
01:34:48,590 --> 01:34:50,600
Hey Bata, what was !!

968
01:34:50,740 --> 01:34:51,330
Who is that?

969
01:34:51,620 --> 01:34:53,040
Whatever it is, I'm telling you

970
01:34:54,140 --> 01:34:55,760
Why did her mother say it?

971
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:56,920
Whose mother?

972
01:34:57,140 --> 01:34:58,730
Whose mother is telling you

973
01:35:00,170 --> 01:35:02,270
Why is she going to marry?

974
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:02,930
Who is she

975
01:35:02,950 --> 01:35:04,120
Anyway, I'm telling you

976
01:35:04,770 --> 01:35:06,110
Why am I here everything?

977
01:35:06,140 --> 01:35:07,400
Did you mix these vines?

978
01:35:14,940 --> 01:35:15,940
What type of escape?

979
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:17,980
You can not be that

980
01:35:18,660 --> 01:35:19,660
I do not like

981
01:35:19,730 --> 01:35:21,030
You can not even do that

982
01:35:21,240 --> 01:35:22,240
Madam ..

983
01:35:26,290 --> 01:35:27,520
See what the boy's friend is doing

984
01:35:33,980 --> 01:35:35,650
Do not have phone number?
I knew you would ask that

985
01:35:42,440 --> 01:35:44,040
Keep the phone in the speaker

986
01:35:45,720 --> 01:35:47,710
Who is calling this time again?

987
01:35:48,350 --> 01:35:49,030
Where are you

988
01:35:49,540 --> 01:35:49,950
Who?

989
01:35:50,060 --> 01:35:51,590
Megha Subramaniam

990
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:55,590
Oma ... as if he was James Bond
Mega mega will be there !!

991
01:35:58,470 --> 01:36:00,600
You do not have to say what to say
Tell me which hotel you are

992
01:36:00,690 --> 01:36:01,690
Taj Hotel

993
01:36:01,710 --> 01:36:02,380
I am coming

994
01:36:02,510 --> 01:36:05,140
I'm waiting
Come on, come on ...

995
01:36:06,810 --> 01:36:09,820
My head is getting angry
Let's go

996
01:36:15,290 --> 01:36:15,900
That's the room

997
01:36:16,060 --> 01:36:16,650
Let's go

998
01:36:16,850 --> 01:36:21,690
You're the girl going inside you
Do not have to worry ... stay here

999
01:36:28,150 --> 01:36:29,710
Why is this condition of the hotel with a bottle of wine?

1000
01:36:30,140 --> 01:36:32,220
What is this donkey thinking that is going to get !!

1001
01:36:36,080 --> 03:13:05,550
What do you think now?
What else to do !!

1002
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:40,750
We'll beat him up

1003
01:36:42,010 --> 01:36:42,760
Let's go

1004
01:36:42,780 --> 01:36:45,640
This, he'll beat me ... !!!

1005
01:36:45,780 --> 01:36:48,640
I'll see where to do

1006
01:36:49,370 --> 01:36:52,180
We'll beat you as well as we drink

1007
01:36:54,370 --> 01:36:59,970
Your mind after drinking alcohol
The courage that is seen will end

1008
01:37:06,460 --> 01:37:08,770
Will you work with these coins?
Coins do not work

1009
01:37:08,860 --> 01:37:10,770
I'll finish you completely

1010
01:37:28,700 --> 01:37:31,360
You're attacking off the lights
I have courage to come in front of me

1011
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:35,360
Where have you been hiding?
this

1012
01:37:49,290 --> 01:37:52,640
The innocent son like me is alone
You're hiding in this way !!!

1013
01:37:52,790 --> 01:37:55,640
There is no kindness in you?
Are you really a man?

1014
01:37:55,990 --> 01:37:57,400
Leave it, please

1015
01:37:59,420 --> 01:38:01,180
Let me quench these sinners from God

1016
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:17,500
Are you really man or beast?

1017
01:38:57,320 --> 01:38:58,180
I have to go inside

1018
01:38:58,700 --> 01:39:00,090
What do I do now, sir?

1019
01:39:00,240 --> 01:39:01,240
Take the bottle of wine

1020
01:39:01,680 --> 01:39:03,390
All of them are scattered on the other side

1021
01:39:03,410 --> 01:39:05,500
What are you saying?

1022
01:39:05,830 --> 01:39:07,210
Apa
- What happened?

1023
01:39:07,300 --> 01:39:08,300
I've eaten a lot

1024
01:39:12,430 --> 01:39:16,990
Though Bhola seems to see them
At night, behaves like innocent animals with animals

1025
01:39:17,050 --> 01:39:18,300
Do you want to eat again?

1026
01:39:18,710 --> 01:39:22,090
Sir, this room seems to be a problem
After a while the current went away and came

1027
01:39:22,210 --> 01:39:25,090
I'm complaining about house kapping

1028
01:39:25,550 --> 01:39:26,550
I'm cutting off from here

1029
01:39:31,580 --> 01:39:33,790
Are you human
Are you not ashamed at all?

1030
01:39:34,230 --> 01:39:36,830
Drink your own money
What's to shame?

1031
01:39:36,850 --> 01:39:38,190
Do you drink alcohol in it?

1032
01:39:38,250 --> 01:39:41,190
You know very well why I'm here
Give me that, I'll leave

1033
01:39:43,990 --> 01:39:45,710
You're so far away for me?

1034
01:39:45,990 --> 01:39:47,710
I told myself, I used to go to myself

1035
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:49,130
Not so Pammy
- Of course

1036
01:39:49,180 --> 01:39:50,880
This shit ... ..
Where is the hostage?

1037
01:39:52,980 --> 01:39:55,470
Hostage? There was woski
That's also the end

1038
01:39:56,020 --> 01:39:57,560
When are you dog
Have you started kidnapping?

1039
01:39:58,130 --> 01:39:59,420
Dog?

1040
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:01,840
This sound

1041
01:40:06,510 --> 01:40:07,310
Hostage

1042
01:40:11,630 --> 01:40:14,710
We did not have to be hostage and small !!!
Seeing this, I remembered her

1043
01:40:15,250 --> 01:40:16,250
Sorry, buddy

1044
01:40:20,810 --> 01:40:21,820


1045
01:40:34,870 --> 01:40:37,720
I thought the childhood memories
I have forgotten

1046
01:40:38,700 --> 01:40:42,180
Dad let me leave him while I was young
Said, I did not know that you have it

1047
01:40:42,720 --> 01:40:46,630
Do you think it is easy to leave !!!
Keep it bigger than that

1048
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:16,560
Why did you do it Why did you?

1049
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:18,260
There is no money for medicines

1050
01:41:18,420 --> 01:41:20,660
You drink me alcohol
Just forgetting, Pammi

1051
01:41:21,020 --> 01:41:23,660
You know how to mood and destroy people

1052
01:41:27,630 --> 01:41:29,550
Do you want to steal the dog?

1053
01:41:35,020 --> 01:41:37,890
How many memories have I got because of that cookie

1054
01:41:38,100 --> 01:41:43,180
You have now become an international thief
Now I want to know your complete information

1055
01:41:49,220 --> 01:41:50,660
You will not say so

1056
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:53,040
You will be taught to remove your lungi

1057
01:41:55,500 --> 01:41:56,210
Sorry

1058
01:42:03,850 --> 01:42:05,220
What's going on here?

1059
01:42:06,170 --> 01:42:07,170
What are you doing

1060
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:19,800
What did you say at midnight?

1061
01:42:20,140 --> 01:42:22,940
Dad, I miss you
I want to see you, father

1062
01:42:23,140 --> 01:42:24,940
Come on fast, father

1063
01:42:25,010 --> 01:42:25,580
Where are you?

1064
01:42:25,730 --> 01:42:28,660
I am in Koodur Taj Hotel
Room number 4028

1065
01:42:28,760 --> 01:42:29,760
Why did you go there?

1066
01:42:34,780 --> 01:42:38,460
I did not know, came here
You have to see such a scene

1067
01:42:39,150 --> 01:42:42,750
Apu says this dog is yours because
You should take charge of it yourself

1068
01:42:42,950 --> 01:42:43,750
Hold it

1069
01:42:49,310 --> 01:42:51,840
What does that girl and dog mean?

1070
01:42:52,010 --> 01:42:55,140
You are no longer this dog
Do not understand this incident, Uncle

1071
01:42:56,940 --> 01:42:58,940
Do we get out of here?
Can I speak out somewhere?

1072
01:43:06,910 --> 01:43:09,370
You were very good in America
So why are you coming here?

1073
01:43:09,740 --> 01:43:12,130
At night you gave me the phone
On the phone, I said it was a fool

1074
01:43:12,240 --> 01:43:14,130
And I do not understand this dog case

1075
01:43:14,840 --> 01:43:17,740
Mother, you say, what have I done here?

1076
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:20,740
At night I called the signal repeatedly
It was said because of proving

1077
01:43:20,770 --> 01:43:22,840
Oh !! You do something for him

1078
01:43:23,660 --> 01:43:25,210
What is the meaning of these crazy things !!

1079
01:43:26,790 --> 01:43:30,910
Just as you think ... there is nothing

1080
01:43:31,220 --> 01:43:35,520
Do not you think, why did you call me?
And why did you cry or cry?

1081
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:37,160
Brandy taste is great, Uncle

1082
01:43:40,780 --> 01:43:42,990
Oh, do not leave her alone

1083
01:43:44,670 --> 01:43:45,950
I know what to do with him

1084
01:44:03,300 --> 01:44:04,460
What's your problem

1085
01:44:04,650 --> 01:44:06,800
Do not forget the night, doctor

1086
01:44:09,140 --> 01:44:12,290
I do not need to know your need
Tell me your problem

1087
01:44:12,820 --> 01:44:15,520
There is no problem here
I love a girl

1088
01:44:15,820 --> 01:44:18,520
I was not contacted with that girl later
After coming here she came to know that she was married

1089
01:44:18,740 --> 01:44:21,000
Then got worried, doctor

1090
01:44:21,530 --> 01:44:22,140
Got married?

1091
01:44:22,160 --> 01:44:23,160
The marriage has stopped, the doctor

1092
01:44:23,940 --> 01:44:24,550
How?

1093
01:44:24,570 --> 01:44:25,420
Akhter got hurt

1094
01:44:26,250 --> 01:44:26,820
That girl

1095
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:27,840
His mother, doctor

1096
01:44:29,170 --> 01:44:30,630
I saw (in the sense of understanding)
I did not see the doctor

1097
01:44:31,340 --> 01:44:33,020
I understand
I did not understand, the doctor

1098
01:44:37,050 --> 01:44:38,370
I understand your emotions

1099
01:44:40,310 --> 01:44:42,020
There is a problem like you
I saw in a girl

1100
01:44:42,050 --> 01:44:42,510
Really

1101
01:44:42,550 --> 01:44:45,110
Now she is very happy to get married

1102
01:44:45,420 --> 01:44:46,630
I can not believe, the doctor

1103
01:44:46,890 --> 01:44:47,890
What do you want me to prove?

1104
01:44:48,020 --> 01:44:49,020
Yes, the doctor

1105
01:44:49,040 --> 01:44:50,180
One second

1106
01:45:02,330 --> 01:45:05,610
Sorry, the clouds Because I'm busy working
You could not get married

1107
01:45:05,720 --> 01:45:07,850
No problem, doctors
The next time must come

1108
01:45:10,420 --> 01:45:10,990
Married again?

1109
01:45:11,200 --> 01:45:12,200
Marriage has gone back

1110
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:14,440
The marriage date is back

1111
01:45:15,770 --> 01:45:17,820
Doctor, mother will talk

1112
01:45:17,970 --> 01:45:20,530
Doctor Mitra, dinner arranged in the evening
You have to come

1113
01:45:21,490 --> 01:45:23,080
Of course, Mrs. Subramaniam

1114
01:45:24,420 --> 01:45:25,420
What happened, doctor?

1115
01:45:26,550 --> 01:45:28,780
There are dinners tomorrow

1116
01:45:29,890 --> 01:45:32,920
Of course, you also met that patient
Maybe you too will change

1117
01:45:32,990 --> 01:45:35,500
Doctor, I'm a lot excited

1118
01:45:36,750 --> 01:45:37,750
This is mine

1119
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:39,180
Sorry, doctor

1120
01:45:40,170 --> 01:45:41,890
Now you can go

1121
01:45:46,500 --> 01:45:49,720
These donkeys want to eat each one
This guy would rather sit down than coffee

1122
01:45:52,280 --> 01:45:54,910
That boy is not seen here?

1123
01:45:54,990 --> 01:45:55,990
I'm also waiting, sir

1124
01:45:56,670 --> 01:46:00,600
He does not have problems here or there
But he must understand his own place

1125
01:46:00,910 --> 01:46:01,910
Will he come?

1126
01:46:01,980 --> 01:46:03,720
We must win

1127
01:46:03,950 --> 01:46:04,830
Then you go?

1128
01:46:05,180 --> 01:46:06,670
That's a lot of cost

1129
01:46:08,180 --> 01:46:09,180


1130
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:10,700


1131
01:46:10,820 --> 01:46:11,360


1132
01:46:11,490 --> 01:46:12,050
Where is he now?

1133
01:46:12,410 --> 01:46:13,080
It's just there

1134
01:46:13,360 --> 01:46:14,970
Talk to you later

1135
01:46:15,870 --> 01:46:16,870
Dr. Mitra

1136
01:46:18,590 --> 01:46:19,120
Ramesh

1137
01:46:19,970 --> 01:46:21,750
What are you doing here

1138
01:46:24,780 --> 01:46:30,750
I'm talking about Dr. Mitra, he's emotional
About the disease was almost getting the Nobel

1139
01:46:30,780 --> 01:46:31,780
What are you doing here

1140
01:46:31,850 --> 01:46:32,850
That girl is my patient

1141
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:34,420
The girl who is hands on the hair
My son's marriage with that girl

1142
01:46:42,650 --> 01:46:43,660
I was actually talking about the big girl

1143
01:46:44,360 --> 01:46:46,370
You are so broad-minded people
I did not know before, Ramesh

1144
01:46:49,020 --> 01:46:50,860
What is the situation now?

1145
01:46:53,690 --> 01:46:55,240
Now she's fine

1146
01:46:55,390 --> 01:46:56,390
Oh really?
- Yes

1147
01:47:00,630 --> 01:47:02,810
But he does not seem to see me

1148
01:47:06,860 --> 01:47:09,510
Before marriage, everyone has small thoughts, Ramesh

1149
01:47:10,360 --> 01:47:12,500
Think of such behavior?

1150
01:47:12,610 --> 01:47:15,950
Yes, this is the case in medical terms, Ramesh

1151
01:47:17,790 --> 01:47:20,570
Now, I understood better

1152
01:47:20,790 --> 01:47:22,570
You're really very talented

1153
01:47:22,650 --> 01:47:23,640
I know, Ramesh

1154
01:47:23,740 --> 01:47:28,850
But Mitra does not know about this
If they learn, they will suffer discomfort

1155
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:30,570
I forgot that, Ramesh

1156
01:47:36,790 --> 01:47:37,790


1157
01:47:38,720 --> 01:47:39,410
I'm coming

1158
01:47:44,770 --> 01:47:45,770


1159
01:47:46,430 --> 01:47:47,930
Did you know Ramesh beforehand?

1160
01:47:50,280 --> 01:47:51,670


1161
01:47:51,750 --> 01:47:52,240
No need to know that

1162
01:47:53,050 --> 01:47:55,240
My purpose is Megha that your patient ...

1163
01:47:55,750 --> 01:47:57,240
Do not tell him

1164
01:47:57,880 --> 01:47:59,860
If he could know it
Then he will suffer from embarrassment

1165
01:48:00,710 --> 01:48:02,520


1166
01:48:07,860 --> 01:48:10,710
Dr. Mitra, are you so laughing at jokes?

1167
01:48:10,730 --> 01:48:11,730
It's not as you think

1168
01:48:13,610 --> 01:48:15,890
Why is this boy coming here?

1169
01:48:15,920 --> 01:48:16,820
Do you know him

1170
01:48:17,020 --> 01:48:17,880
How do you know him

1171
01:48:18,030 --> 01:48:19,530
And my patient, I'm okay
Here's the invitation

1172
01:48:20,030 --> 01:48:22,530
Bringing a patient in contact with another patient
Then they also change in their own way

1173
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:25,890
Aadhaar card comes to me as well
How do you go with all the problems?

1174
01:48:26,260 --> 01:48:29,280
Present mental problems
It's a big problem, not Ramesh

1175
01:48:29,640 --> 01:48:30,820


1176
01:48:32,120 --> 01:48:33,120
He's here too

1177
01:48:33,860 --> 01:48:35,730
Who is the guy?
The guy reading that suite

1178
01:48:35,970 --> 01:48:39,190
I'll take care of this guy
What are you

1179
01:48:48,790 --> 01:48:52,330
Dr. Mitra at the end of the ceremony
Would like to meet you

1180
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:57,180


1181
01:48:59,870 --> 01:49:01,050
You're coming in right time, do not you?

1182
01:49:01,780 --> 01:49:03,100
We have good timing, sir

1183
01:49:03,550 --> 01:49:04,550
I asked her

1184
01:49:04,860 --> 01:49:05,860
I said, sir

1185
01:49:06,760 --> 01:49:11,430
Dr. Mitra is here all
You need help

1186
01:49:13,730 --> 01:49:14,730
Mother, do not you worry

1187
01:49:16,030 --> 01:49:17,030
I'm not telling you something

1188
01:49:31,600 --> 01:49:34,480
I am that your patient
He may not know

1189
01:49:35,790 --> 01:49:36,790
Even if he knows what?

1190
01:49:36,970 --> 01:49:38,940
Because of him, this situation is due to me today

1191
01:49:39,250 --> 01:49:40,090
Because of him?

1192
01:49:40,110 --> 01:49:42,310
Dr. Mitra meets at the office

1193
01:49:42,330 --> 01:49:42,730
Why?

1194
01:49:42,760 --> 01:49:45,510
Because Dr. is the only protected place

1195
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:46,600
What?

1196
01:49:47,140 --> 01:49:49,180
Dr. Mitra, I have a little request

1197
01:49:49,350 --> 01:49:51,810
Do you have
What is that?

1198
01:49:51,930 --> 01:49:55,470
I know that girl is your patient
You knew that you would tell me about that too

1199
01:49:55,950 --> 01:49:57,030
You know that girl?

1200
01:49:57,270 --> 01:49:58,280
I know his mother, doctor

1201
01:49:58,490 --> 01:49:59,490
How do you know his mother?

1202
01:49:59,990 --> 01:50:01,150
The girl introduced, the doctor

1203
01:50:01,180 --> 01:50:02,530
Why would that girl introduce you to me?

1204
01:50:02,890 --> 01:50:04,130
Because I know that girl, the doctor

1205
01:50:04,230 --> 01:50:05,710
How do you know that girl?

1206
01:50:05,940 --> 01:50:07,220
That's because of Ramesh, the doctor

1207
01:50:07,380 --> 01:50:08,950
Where did Ramesh come from?

1208
01:50:09,300 --> 01:50:10,970
Because the girl helped me, the doctor

1209
01:50:11,070 --> 01:50:13,000
How did Ramesh know that girl?

1210
01:50:13,020 --> 01:50:14,470
I introduced, the doctor

1211
01:50:14,570 --> 01:50:17,780
If you introduce
How did that girl help you?

1212
01:50:17,800 --> 01:50:19,910
Because he is more than me
She liked the girl more

1213
01:50:20,720 --> 01:50:22,770
So this marriage is going on?
Do not know, doctor

1214
01:50:23,090 --> 01:50:24,490
How do you know that?

1215
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:27,860
Have you not heard First of all, this is the marriage
He stopped because of him

1216
01:50:31,310 --> 01:50:32,450
Then who killed the accident?

1217
01:50:32,520 --> 01:50:33,160
Unake

1218
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:35,490
Love?
-This girl

1219
01:50:36,500 --> 01:50:38,060
So why is he coming here?
Stop it

1220
01:50:38,370 --> 01:50:39,570
Then my friend Ramesh

1221
01:50:39,730 --> 01:50:40,730
Ass

1222
01:50:42,410 --> 01:50:45,530
Dr. Mitra, I want to tell you a secret

1223
01:50:46,920 --> 01:50:47,920
What do we do now?

1224
01:50:48,450 --> 01:50:51,430
You need to know the doctor you are
But I know you can not cure this disease

1225
01:50:55,820 --> 01:50:59,120
What was your sister
Do not like her marriage?

1226
01:50:59,700 --> 01:51:02,070
No, will you marry?

1227
01:51:02,410 --> 01:51:05,420
Doctor, what are you saying?
There's a lot, come from here

1228
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:06,510
Dr. Mitra

1229
01:51:08,010 --> 01:51:11,680
If a new patient has forgotten old friend
Now what is the talk between two?

1230
01:51:11,930 --> 01:51:13,140
You know, Ramesh

1231
01:51:13,160 --> 01:51:13,950
About the patient?

1232
01:51:14,040 --> 01:51:15,040
What did he do

1233
01:51:15,060 --> 01:51:17,060


1234
01:51:17,090 --> 01:51:20,440
No, Ramesh will have to leave soon
Otherwise, it will end, Ramesh

1235
01:51:20,470 --> 01:51:21,750
Then we'll take it again, Ramesh

1236
01:51:21,860 --> 01:51:23,300
Then come back again, Ramesh

1237
01:51:23,480 --> 01:51:25,370
If these are closed again
Will be organized again, Mitra

1238
01:51:25,570 --> 01:51:27,210
That's it, sir

1239
01:51:27,900 --> 01:51:30,740
Ramesh, what do you know?
You speak properly

1240
01:51:31,720 --> 01:51:32,720
I'm talking with experience

1241
01:51:33,090 --> 01:51:35,160
There are many people here to be treated

1242
01:51:40,410 --> 01:51:41,410
Why is the dog adoring your legs?

1243
01:51:41,570 --> 01:51:42,900
Because I'm afraid of dogs

1244
01:51:43,460 --> 01:51:45,450
I asked her
I told you

1245
01:51:46,410 --> 01:51:47,820
Mitra, you do something

1246
01:51:47,910 --> 01:51:49,820
That's why Ramesh said I went away

1247
01:51:50,300 --> 01:51:51,300
You also say to enjoy the party

1248
01:51:51,540 --> 01:51:54,650
This dog came to him in so many people

1249
01:51:54,900 --> 01:51:57,640
Do you guess that
Do not know whether or not?

1250
01:51:57,720 --> 01:51:59,600
Oh friend, why are you thinking so much?

1251
01:51:59,780 --> 01:52:03,160
Do not worry! Somebody's dogs
If you want to admit to someone else ...

1252
01:52:03,270 --> 01:52:05,300
You also say the party enjoys
What else can I do there?

1253
01:52:05,340 --> 01:52:08,870
Dr. Mitra, do you come in contact with him?
If you are crazy enough !!!

1254
01:52:09,010 --> 01:52:11,280
Yes, it's been
Here's the situation

1255
01:52:17,780 --> 01:52:18,780


1256
01:52:20,490 --> 01:52:21,730
I saw this photo once

1257
01:52:22,660 --> 01:52:23,660
Two days ago I came to India

1258
01:52:24,530 --> 01:52:25,690
I will get married on the 3rd day

1259
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:28,590
But suddenly the marriage stopped

1260
01:52:29,430 --> 01:52:30,430


1261
01:52:31,310 --> 01:52:33,510


1262
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:37,360
The date is correct after 10 days

1263
01:52:38,300 --> 01:52:42,980
I am waiting for that day

1264
01:52:45,160 --> 01:52:46,160
Clap

1265
01:52:48,390 --> 01:52:50,040
Waiting for this moment

1266
01:52:50,330 --> 01:52:53,140
One Einstein, Socrates
And Mitra said

1267
01:52:54,070 --> 01:52:55,460


1268
01:52:56,750 --> 01:52:58,210


1269
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:01,080
Although she speaks less

1270
01:53:01,880 --> 01:53:03,220
He has a lot of simplicity

1271
01:53:04,130 --> 01:53:05,710


1272
01:53:05,960 --> 01:53:07,570


1273
01:53:08,080 --> 01:53:13,840


1274
01:53:28,680 --> 01:53:29,680
I'm calling

1275
01:53:34,110 --> 01:53:35,110
Why are you laughing

1276
01:53:37,240 --> 01:53:39,990
I'm just in trouble
Let me be like me

1277
01:53:40,240 --> 01:53:41,740
Tell me why you laugh

1278
01:53:45,860 --> 01:53:48,530
I know you very well
The boy was talking about the girl ...

1279
01:53:48,610 --> 01:53:51,530
Your life is in the Clarity
Nobody else can be able to make it

1280
01:53:52,050 --> 01:53:53,270
Because you do not want it for yourself

1281
01:53:53,820 --> 01:53:55,410
Do not talk about my character

1282
01:53:56,550 --> 01:53:59,200
I'm not talking about your character
Let me know about your clarinet

1283
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:04,260
Can you help me a little bit?

1284
01:54:05,680 --> 01:54:06,990
You get out of here

1285
01:54:10,530 --> 01:54:11,860
That's your problem

1286
01:54:13,860 --> 01:54:14,860
Try to control yourself first

1287
01:54:15,520 --> 01:54:16,650
Then you can go ahead

1288
01:54:21,320 --> 01:54:23,370
You have come here to see Ramesh Uncle

1289
01:54:23,420 --> 01:54:26,370
I say, I'll bring you with you
What would you say if you wanted to stay with him?

1290
01:54:27,680 --> 01:54:29,910
The only one who sees and transparently recognizes everyone

1291
01:54:31,970 --> 01:54:32,640
Okay

1292
01:54:34,550 --> 01:54:38,720
I remember what you wanted to say once on the bus
What did Saroja grandma say?

1293
01:54:40,980 --> 01:54:46,960
Never see once again for a while
If you wait second time, wait three times

1294
01:54:47,870 --> 01:54:52,010
For the first time you broke our relationship
I did not do that

1295
01:54:52,680 --> 01:54:56,710
Secondly due to the accident
Your marriage stopped

1296
01:54:58,020 --> 01:55:01,910
The second time, it will be right in the third time

1297
01:55:02,020 --> 01:55:04,010
I do not want to lose the third time

1298
01:55:11,830 --> 01:55:12,830
Sorry

1299
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:14,520
Going away

1300
01:55:29,730 --> 01:55:31,660
You're all clean, are you?

1301
01:55:32,180 --> 01:55:33,180
Absolutely clean, Uncle

1302
01:55:40,630 --> 01:55:45,230
Remember this time,
Dear friends do not marry !!

1303
01:55:47,280 --> 01:55:48,280
That does not matter

1304
01:55:48,550 --> 01:55:50,370
Do not bring water to your eyes, sir

1305
01:55:52,480 --> 01:55:55,350
I also saw ... in life

1306
01:55:55,540 --> 01:55:58,690
You may have seen many people
But I did not see it like that

1307
01:56:00,290 --> 01:56:02,650
I'll give you two lakhs, sir

1308
01:56:09,130 --> 01:56:12,400
Sir, what was he saying?
Did not you say anything?

1309
01:56:15,680 --> 01:56:18,460
Now it is important to separate them

1310
01:56:19,750 --> 01:56:21,120
She is in a hurry now

1311
01:56:22,300 --> 01:56:23,300
I said openly

1312
01:56:25,880 --> 01:56:28,410
I feel so bad ...
Where to go or drink?

1313
01:56:28,860 --> 01:56:30,830
Oh really? I know a good place
Let's go there

1314
01:56:43,620 --> 01:56:44,620
what's the problem?

1315
01:56:45,770 --> 01:56:47,840
You do not understand ... Failure in love

1316
01:56:51,720 --> 01:56:53,380
Who gave up?
You or she

1317
01:56:55,180 --> 01:56:56,180
What are the other ways?

1318
01:56:59,460 --> 01:57:00,950
What's your story

1319
01:57:09,490 --> 01:57:10,820
Meet him in the rainy season

1320
01:57:11,270 --> 01:57:12,690
Love him in the winter

1321
01:57:13,260 --> 01:57:14,400
I got separated in the summer

1322
01:57:14,930 --> 01:57:16,990
Is it the story of the love of both of you?
Are you reporting any weather?

1323
01:57:21,770 --> 01:57:22,770
How many years love

1324
01:57:23,130 --> 01:57:23,900
One year and a half

1325
01:57:23,970 --> 01:57:27,070
We do not have so much time
Tell us briefly

1326
02:01:25,470 --> 02:01:26,470
Have you been ready?

1327
02:01:28,290 --> 02:01:29,290
Do you want to say something

1328
02:01:31,020 --> 02:01:32,020
Come

1329
02:02:24,260 --> 02:02:25,580
Hello
-Force

1330
02:02:26,690 --> 02:02:27,690
I am

1331
02:02:29,100 --> 02:02:31,550
I want to go back to America

1332
02:02:31,550 --> 02:02:33,120
What are you saying ... hello

1333
02:02:33,660 --> 02:02:34,660
At the moment
Where are you?

1334
02:04:27,930 --> 02:04:30,680
Someone has been together for a while
I can never forget that

1335
02:06:42,650 --> 02:06:43,650
Get out of here

1336
02:06:45,080 --> 02:06:46,080
I'll leave

1337
02:06:49,270 --> 02:06:50,270
Sorry

1338
02:06:50,940 --> 02:06:51,940
Going away

1339
02:07:20,880 --> 02:07:23,090
Talk to a duty doctor
The patient's pulse is falling

1340
02:08:35,890 --> 02:08:37,900
Doctor, patient pulse is decreasing

1341
02:10:27,170 --> 02:10:28,410
Let them talk

1342
02:10:33,330 --> 02:10:35,090
You know what he wants

1343
02:10:36,260 --> 02:10:37,260
You do not have to say anything

1344
02:11:04,890 --> 02:11:19,450


1345
02:11:24,790 --> 02:11:25,980
I'm not right for you

1346
02:11:28,390 --> 02:11:29,390
You're not right for me

1347
02:11:31,770 --> 02:11:34,750
That's why we should be together

1348
02:11:38,430 --> 02:11:42,170
Every moment of happiness and sorrow in life
We both will spend together

1349
02:11:45,100 --> 02:11:46,100
Without you, I'm not perfect

1350
02:11:47,250 --> 02:11:48,250
There is a quarrel between us

1351
02:11:48,590 --> 02:11:49,590
Yes, we must fight

1352
02:11:49,880 --> 02:11:50,880
I fight each day

1353
02:11:51,930 --> 02:11:52,930
But then

1354
02:11:53,570 --> 02:11:56,880
Do not fight between yourselves, from a distance
What should not be done next to each other

1355
02:11:59,670 --> 02:12:00,670
Right, right?

1356
02:12:06,330 --> 02:12:10,540
How much do you like me
I do not know much about myself

1357
02:12:22,910 --> 02:12:23,910
I am

1358
02:12:29,180 --> 02:12:30,220
I can not cook

1359
02:12:31,180 --> 02:12:32,220
-What can I do?

1360
02:12:35,440 --> 02:12:37,920
I drink plenty of alcohol

1361
02:12:37,990 --> 02:12:38,920
I do not like that

1362
02:12:41,460 --> 02:12:42,460
I will change

1363
02:12:43,760 --> 02:12:44,200
I'm a little arrogant

1364
02:12:44,760 --> 02:12:46,200
I'll take care of you

1365
02:12:49,300 --> 02:12:51,640
I will roam with a friend on holiday

1366
02:12:52,490 --> 02:12:53,210
Only one day

1367
02:12:54,740 --> 02:12:57,000
That's okay

1368
02:12:58,600 --> 02:12:59,760
When we will have kids

1369
02:13:01,960 --> 02:13:03,380
Together they will take care of them

1370
02:13:09,500 --> 02:13:12,340
Now everything is okay?

1371
02:13:13,150 --> 02:13:15,420
If I say you say yes 3 times yes

1372
02:13:17,420 --> 02:13:18,420
Okay

1373
02:13:28,870 --> 02:13:30,740
Uncle, I have no clericality in my life

1374
02:13:31,130 --> 02:13:32,480
You want to talk about that

1375
02:13:33,410 --> 02:13:35,230
I and one another
Love for a long time

1376
02:13:37,900 --> 02:13:38,530
Yes

1377
02:13:41,590 --> 02:13:43,440
And my mother accidentally caused the accident

1378
02:13:43,700 --> 02:13:45,130
That's what I said earlier

1379
02:13:50,650 --> 02:13:51,450
Yes

1380
02:13:53,850 --> 02:13:56,660
It's a matter of marriage
He said he would take care of them

1381
02:14:02,800 --> 02:14:03,580
Yes

1382
02:14:09,150 --> 02:14:10,700
All is clean?

1383
02:14:11,420 --> 02:14:12,900
It's time to rest now

1384
02:14:13,370 --> 02:14:15,850
Let's get out of here ... Stand aside

1385
02:14:17,220 --> 02:14:18,190
Everyone goes a little bit away

1386
02:14:23,110 --> 02:14:25,250
Still, what you're doing
I do not like those things

1387
02:14:25,330 --> 02:14:29,750
What is that? Before you beat your mother
Then I killed you ... now Ramesh

1388
02:14:29,830 --> 02:14:30,990
Now there will be no marriage

1389
02:14:31,220 --> 02:14:34,630
They're both one for being one
Why did we go with it?

1390
02:14:35,290 --> 02:14:37,500
You're a lot of useful people
Check and give it

1391
02:14:40,420 --> 02:14:43,840
Uncle, help me once
You said to remember all your life

1392
02:14:44,610 --> 02:14:47,430
But she did not care about me
I did not even know that would give me such an experience

1393
02:14:55,090 --> 02:14:57,200
Did you know it before?

1394
02:15:03,100 --> 02:15:03,930
Did you know

1395
02:15:06,210 --> 02:15:07,350
How do you know?

1396
02:15:13,410 --> 02:15:14,410
Dr. Mitra

1397
02:15:17,780 --> 02:15:18,640
Have they gone?

1398
02:15:20,110 --> 02:15:21,590
Did you know that?

1399
02:15:21,800 --> 02:15:25,490
How many times have I told you?
If you say repeatedly to enjoy the party

1400
02:15:31,070 --> 02:15:33,800
My head was lost, Mitra

1401
02:15:34,440 --> 02:15:35,640
It's time, Ramesh

1402
02:15:36,450 --> 02:15:37,450
Oh really?

1403
02:15:45,150 --> 02:15:46,460
Will he let me in?

1404
02:15:46,750 --> 02:15:48,030
Will give
-No, I'll take it in front

1405
02:15:48,170 --> 02:15:50,670
My name is Pammi ... I am that
His boyfriend from his childhood

1406
02:15:51,170 --> 02:15:52,670
Know us and since childhood
-What is the girl in childhood?

1407
02:15:52,760 --> 02:15:53,760
This girl

1408
02:15:54,280 --> 02:15:56,100
So that love is it !!

1409
02:15:56,480 --> 02:15:58,520
So what do I say from the beginning?
I know the guy

1410
02:15:58,940 --> 02:16:00,710
Do you want to tell everyone?
Come on, come on

1411
02:16:00,940 --> 02:16:03,060
Does he know about this?

1412
02:16:03,370 --> 02:16:04,370
How will he know?

1413
02:16:04,600 --> 02:16:06,960
Can i say something to him?
-Are you still skeptical?

1414
02:16:07,040 --> 02:17:50,344
Thanks for enjoying the movie with Bengali Sub !!!
