1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can tease somebody.

2
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:04,700
CORAÇÃO

3
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,460
Again, he had dreams. Why are
you piercing the pillows

4
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,460
Bring water.

5
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,510
What are you doing?

6
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:59,140
- Come to your senses.
- Money, money...

7
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,300
Come to your senses.

8
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,640
Flood has come
-Come to your senses

9
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,140
This is not money,
this is cotton

10
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,720
You have put water
on my lakhs

11
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:20,110
You already have lakhs
How much more do you need?

12
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:24,350
I want to earn crores.
You don't know the effect of...

13
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,060
...money on me.

14
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:31,430
It makes me ecstatic and makes merry.

15
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,060
It makes me feel like dance.

16
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:38,320
It makes me feel like sing.

17
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,770
It makes feel like a flower!

18
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,660
I can do anything for money.
Live or even die or can dance.

19
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:50,320
Can you take bath. The Pandit is coming.
-Pandit?

20
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,030
He will come
and bring good news

21
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:14,260
Devi Lakshmi, always
have mercy on this fool

22
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:21,390
Mother, Eat, drink & have merry,
but do not leave me & go.

23
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:26,660
Has burnt for long?
-Seth, you are using this...

24
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:34,000
...same Agarbatti, now leave it
-Five or fifty years...

25
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:38,020
...when Devi Lakshmi has no
problem, what is your problem?

26
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:43,020
Tell me, has the Pandit come?
-He is waiting for a long time

27
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:47,050
See Sethji, I have brought lot of
alliances after choosing a lot.

28
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,660
Keep them inside, I am not
interested in their beauty.

29
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,680
If blind, I will put eyes, if
limp, can put Jaipur legs...

30
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,840
...if fat, not give her food,
but she should be the...

31
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:03,000
...only daughter of a man having
crores. Sit down.

32
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,640
Even if not beautiful, the
horoscopes should match

33
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:12,020
That is okay. But I should get
dowry. I have only one son.

34
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:21,310
I can only conduct his marriage
once & reap the maximum

35
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:27,000
- Have tea
- Fool, you want to kill the Pandit?

36
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:31,000
But I am not giving poison
-There is sugar in tea...

37
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,020
...if Pandit gets diabetes
and dies, then

38
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:40,570
I don't have diabetes- You have
that danger if you eat sugar

39
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:42,960
I am ready to take the risk
- I won't allow.

40
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,900
- I won't allow- I'll have.

41
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,890
A fly has fallen in the tea.

42
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:56,420
Now it is waste.

43
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:03,490
Panditji, no fly can drink
Hazari Prasad's tea

44
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:17,300
So, what were you telling
-Your wish is ok...

45
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,470
...but your son's wish is also
necessary.

46
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:27,030
No need, he is my son and for
seven generations, our family's

47
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:32,170
...own aim is we can lose
our skin but not money

48
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,720
Were you teasing a
lonely girl?

49
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,260
I was not teasing.

50
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:25,060
Actually, she...

51
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,270
...looks like my dead sister.

52
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:30,420
So sad!

53
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:34,000
lf you don't mind...

54
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,290
...tie this rakhi in my hands.

55
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:40,040
- Why not? Sure!
Thanks.

56
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,480
Okay, sister.

57
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:47,190
Keep meeting me

58
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,100
Raja, you narrowly escaped
getting beaten by a slipper

59
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,670
My calculation is straight,
if she accepts, ok, or this rakhi

60
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,390
This eve-teasing of yours has
made us late for college. Come

61
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:17,020
Raja, is this is the time to
come to college. Answer!

62
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:29,000
Sir, my father had the fourth
heart attack - Oh my God

63
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,680
You should be in hospital now
-But my lectures, attendance, sir

64
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:37,690
I will see to all that
-Thank you, sir

65
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,360
Go to the classes.

66
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:09,450
Where are you all going,
lecture is not over.

67
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:22,020
Peace! Peace!

68
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,660
Friends, Before 21
years there was a revolution.

69
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:31,910
Tonight, there will be another.
Today so much beer will...

70
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:37,030
...flow that flood will come. With
our dance, the earth will tremble

71
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:42,100
The reason is, today is Raja's
birthday. You all are invited.

72
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,070
This is the bill for the party.

73
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,760
Raja gives only the heart...

74
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,680
...the bill be paid by
my father.

75
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:18,480
Dad says "He'll make a great name for himself,

76
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:23,000
my son will do such astounding things!"

77
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,110
But what no one knows

78
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:33,020
is where my exact destination lies.

79
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:03,380
Hey Pandu, what is this?
-Can't you see this is a party?

80
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,790
But where are you taking
this Pista & Badam?

81
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,860
For the guests!
- Bring it here.

82
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,980
You don't eat.

83
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:16,220
Why- The dogs can't
digest the ghee.

84
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,190
You call me a dog!

85
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,010
Who is this?

86
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:04,020
Look at this bill, Seth

87
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:42,000
What did you do yesterday?
Will your father pay this bill?

88
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:45,580
You don't have to ask me for
that. Pay it

89
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:51,360
Foolish, useless guy-Why are
shouting at him in the morning?

90
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:58,720
He spent 20,000 in one day
-Wrong, it was 19,800-

91
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,050
Leave it, every day he does'nt
party. It was his birthday.

92
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:10,420
That was my death day. He has
celebrated 21 birthdays till now

93
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:18,870
Son, I save money with difficulty
and you are spending it away.

94
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:24,590
Foolish fellow-Father, Lakshmi
is tired sitting in your locker

95
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:29,540
So I took her for a ride
-Are you searching something

96
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:32,870
My motorbike's key
-lt has gone

97
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:36,710
Where is it?
-With the motorbike.

98
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,820
Where is it?
-I have sold it

99
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:43,280
Why?-To pay the bill for
your party.

100
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,800
Then, how will I go to college
-Like Gandhi i.e. walking

101
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,720
What have you done?-I have
proved to him, what I am

102
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,710
What?- That I am
your father.

103
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:06,080
Raja, your party was great
-Your father is very good

104
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,560
Don't take the
name of my father

105
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:12,250
Hey, blind girl

106
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:30,000
Has your father given you the
road also along with the car

107
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:36,000
Why don't you see and walk?
Has your father forgotten...

108
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,690
...to teach you to walk on the
street alongwith manners

109
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:53,130
Is this a girl or a storm?
-Looks like a new one

110
00:17:53,170 --> 00:18:00,720
Yes, as proud as she is
beautiful-She is fire

111
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:07,420
If I don't fry papads on this
fire, my name is not Raja

112
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,610
Can't you see and walk,
are you blind?

113
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:28,040
Is there anyone?
-My God, he is really blind

114
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:40,000
Please take this, did
you get hurt anywhere

115
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
When God has given lifelong
hurt, what are all these hurts?

116
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:53,840
It is not your fault, it is a sin
to be born blind in this world

117
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:59,120
It is not like that, can l
leave you somewhere

118
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:06,610
How does it matter? God has
taken away light of my eyes

119
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:16,000
To get education, I was going to
my college, i.e. D.K. College

120
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:20,770
I also study there, let
me leave you there

121
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:21,790
- Really?
- Yes!

122
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,670
- I can give you a ride.
- No.

123
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:27,350
No, I don't want to trouble you
-No, please come.

124
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,010
Careful, in which floor
is your class

125
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,910
Forgive me-lt is okay

126
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:47,000
You keep your hands on my
shoulders

127
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,380
Really you are taking a lot of
difficulty for me- It's nothing

128
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:56,280
Today you have helped a blind
man. You are very good.

129
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:04,010
Life has been unjust towards you.
God also sometimes...

130
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,560
Who are you?

131
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:26,540
Dev, my name is Dev Anand
-Shut up

132
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:34,060
I will fill love in the
hearts filled with hatred

133
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:37,210
I can make a stone
into a candle -Get lost

134
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:50,450
She came & fell on me
like a pillar of current

135
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:54,620
By God, I enjoyed
the shock

136
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,980
Who the hell are you?

137
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:09,360
You blackened my face
with the road's dirt yesterday

138
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:15,220
Yesterday I only blackened you,
today you'll be red with this

139
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:53,000
She is standing like a stick

140
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Is she a girl or a stick

141
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
is she fire or a flower.
She is a like a cracker

142
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,580
Anger in her eyes.
Abuse in her lips

143
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,320
See, friends what does
she think of herself

144
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:15,000
She is standing like a stick

145
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,520
Is she a girl or a stick

146
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:23,000
is she fire or a flower.
She is a like a cracker

147
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,430
Anger in her eyes.
Abuse in her lips

148
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:33,270
See, what does she think
of herself

149
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:19,350
This white body is made
up of current

150
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:24,800
It is 440 volts,
Touching is prohibited

151
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:43,000
This white body is made
up of current

152
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,310
It is 440 volts,
Touching is prohibited

153
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:54,320
Don't clash with her
and lose your life

154
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:04,770
No!

155
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:08,020
She is standing like a stick

156
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:11,010
Is she a girl or a stick

157
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:15,880
is she fire or a flower.
She is a like a cracker

158
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:20,550
Anger in her eyes.
Abuse in her lips

159
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:26,030
See, friends what does
she think of herself

160
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:04,290
She has come to the
college to study

161
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:09,400
But she is always ready to fight.

162
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,360
She has come to the
college to study

163
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:25,790
But she is always ready to fight.

164
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:37,050
I have taken a oath that
I will break her pride.

165
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,000
She is standing like a stick

166
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:49,000
Is she a girl or a stick

167
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Is she fire or a flower.
She is a like a cracker

168
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:58,830
Anger in her eyes.
Abuse in her lips

169
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:03,990
See, friends what does
she think of herself

170
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:10,570
See, friends what does
she think of herself

171
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:41,000
Keep more waste on that,
don't be a miser.

172
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,650
Seth, keep the weights,
why are you sitting there?

173
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:51,410
Why, are you weighing gold?
I am 32 kgs, why the weight?

174
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:54,530
You are 32 kgs., you will be
72 kgs. at least

175
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:58,000
In this costly age, can one eat
little and become 72 kgs.

176
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,410
Sethji, you are cheating- If you
do business with Hazari Prasad...

177
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:05,020
...you have to do it
his way only.

178
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:09,680
Sethji, why are you swinging her,
Lakshmi(money) has come to you

179
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:14,130
Where is the Lakshmi?- He is
Seth Giridarilal, I told you about

180
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:21,490
Come and sit down.
Tell me, what I should do

181
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:27,000
Seth, he has seen your son on
the college's stage & liked him

182
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,730
So there is no problem. Murari,
go and bring two teas, no!

183
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:34,580
Understood, Lord!
-I also like your daughter

184
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:39,490
Tell me your expectations
-Expectations

185
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,630
The whole list is ready. See it is
small, Giridarilalji

186
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:07,110
Hazariji, I am a very small
person. Can't you reduce this?

187
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:11,330
If you want to reduce, go to the
next shop for your daughter's wedding.

188
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:15,290
I'll go, but let me
tell you clearly, you are doing...

189
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:20,840
...waste paper business, but
your list shows that you...

190
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:25,640
...have to conduct your marriage
with a king's daughter

191
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:35,080
You and the world will see this
miser doing that one day

192
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:40,000
I have not walked so much
in my whole life as today

193
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,840
How much more, Sethji?
-Two more steps, Panditji

194
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:49,000
If I put one step further, I will
die, why are you bent on...

195
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,560
...taking away the life of a
brahmin, could've taken a bus

196
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:58,740
No need for a bus. 10kms
are over, only 3 kms now.

197
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:03,510
No, I can't walk
-Get up, what are you doing?

198
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:07,050
Why are you pushing us?
-My master's car is coming

199
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:19,940
What were you telling?
-From Delhi hotel, we...

200
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:23,010
...got a profit of 50 lakhs
-That is peanuts for me

201
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,520
50 lakhs is nothing. It's peanuts,
do you know what is peanuts.

202
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:34,560
50 lakhs are peanuts
for him

203
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:39,000
Our London hotel has got a
profit of 2 crores

204
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,690
Only that much, I expected 4
crores, this is a loss for us

205
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:52,880
You have important meeting with
Mehra Group of Hotels, Dubai

206
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:56,670
It is impossible today. Today is
my daughter 17th birthday

207
00:29:57,370 --> 00:30:00,000
Please try, sir, it is a matter
of many lakhs

208
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:06,630
My daughter's birthday comes
once a year. Let the lakhs go

209
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:12,760
Only daughter of
a millionaire.

210
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,250
What happened? Your son's
alliance people will be waiting

211
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I got the alliance. Heard
God breaks the roof...

212
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,810
...and gives money, but he has
given me from the sky

213
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:33,000
You mean this rich man!
He will not marry his...

214
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
...cook's daughter to
your son.

215
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,000
He will drive you away like mad
and send you to mental asylum

216
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Leave this idea, and let us
go the place, we left for

217
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:49,000
You don't know this Hazari
Prasad, I have got the...

218
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,850
...rich king, my son's marriage
will take place with his daughter.

219
00:30:55,210 --> 00:31:00,010
For that l
can do anything.

220
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:25,900
Let God do good for you?

221
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:31,800
I have taken appointment, sir
-Can we invite quotations...

222
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
...from Bennett & Colemen?
-Sure

223
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,780
Today one Hazari company's
is starting.

224
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:49,420
There is a meeting in
Hazari Shipping company

225
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:57,810
Looks like a rich man- Must be
a rich heritage, like me.

226
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,860
What was the cost of the
dog roaming- Rs. 500-

227
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:10,000
Are you mad? 500 rupees for
4 dogs, for that much fifty...

228
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,420
...people will be ready to become
dogs-Dog's days have changed...

229
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,810
...but men's days have not
changed- Take this

230
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:19,410
Dogs were small, cheat
What were you- Secretary

231
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:28,000
Give fast, Bachanji is waiting for
me- What is your rate?

232
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,810
Rs. 400- I am broke now.

233
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:43,000
Should bring up dogs or
become an actor

234
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:53,010
Nothing matches you
-Have you joined a drama troupe

235
00:32:56,190 --> 00:33:00,600
This is business- Business!
-You will not understand this

236
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,550
Here thousands will go
but crores will come to us

237
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:11,600
Raja, we accept your guts
-What did I do?

238
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:15,830
Don't act innocent, now?
You have challenged Karate..

239
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:19,210
...Champion, Shakti, and asking
us what you did?

240
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:22,140
I have challenged Shakti!
-What else?

241
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:28,560
Raja will break every part of
Shakti. That is Raja's challenge

242
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:33,140
Shakti will come walking but
go back in a cot, what guts?

243
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:40,510
Raja will die but with a style
-I have not put these posters

244
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,320
What are you telling?
-Whose naughtiness is this?

245
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:52,000
When fox's death comes, he goes
towads the lion

246
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,030
But when a dog wants to die
he calls a lion for a challenge

247
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:02,390
Poor one, he will die young
-Now Raja's game is over

248
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:09,820
Raja, we will not let you down.
I will remove these posters now

249
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:15,680
If posters go, prestige will also
go. Let me face it now

250
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:30,350
He has not come, may not come
-Looks he ran away.

251
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:10,800
Here is our college's champion
for three years, Mr. Shakti

252
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:31,590
He is Mr. Raja, he had the
guts to challenge Mr. Shakti

253
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:39,390
But I feel, it will be unjust not
to give him a last opportunity

254
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:45,110
Mr. Raja, you can still escape
the insult of getting defeated

255
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:48,000
This is the opportunity,
run away

256
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:58,000
But one condition, he will fall at
Shakti's feet and ask forgivance

257
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:12,290
I am ready to fight, but on one
condition. If this Madhu has...

258
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:16,750
...guts, let her accept it
-What is the condition?

259
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:29,970
If I win, in front of everyone, l
will kiss Miss Madhu-Okay

260
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:47,730
But my condition is, if he loses,
he will kiss my friend Mimi

261
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I accept.

262
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:12,340
but if Mr. Shakti is
defeated, he will kiss Mimi

263
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:37,470
Friends, as per the condition
Raja will kiss Madhu here

264
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:54,460
Come, Madhuji, Friends,
give her a big hand

265
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:04,940
I don't put my mouth on
stupid things

266
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:43,880
Son, going to the temple.
-Yes

267
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:47,310
Have you thought about Madhu?

268
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:53,230
For her only I am going to the
temple to pray to God for her

269
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:57,650
Where is our daughter, Madhu?
There she is

270
00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:03,570
Father, I want a pill- Ramu did
not give the vitamin pill to you

271
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:08,380
Oh, daddy, I want a cartridge
-For what

272
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:14,380
I will kill him. Till I shoot him, l
won't have breakfast

273
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:16,060
What happened?

274
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:19,830
He insulted me in front
of everyone.

275
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:21,670
Insulted? Who?

276
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:25,000
He caught me in front of
everyone and...- and What

277
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:31,000
He did'nt do anything - Then
how were you insulted

278
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,300
Let her talk

279
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,440
- Good morning, uncle.
- Hello, Shakti.

280
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,720
- Greetings, grandma.- Greetings.

281
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:41,400
Son, what is this?
Is everything fine?

282
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:45,000
Yes- But your lips look
broken to me

283
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:53,000
Boxing practice became
a bit too much

284
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,890
Don't do such practice that it
becomes difficult to recognize U

285
00:43:57,890 --> 00:44:00,250
When is your father coming from
London?- Next week

286
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:05,350
I forgot, I have to go to the
temple. you talk, I will go

287
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,020
God bless you, Sethji

288
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:24,210
Sethji, our God has come

289
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:38,120
Who is this, look like an
incarnate of King Harishchandra

290
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:40,660
All of you sit peacefully

291
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:53,000
What will happen to us poor, if
you are not there.

292
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,000
I consider myself poorer
than you as God has given...

293
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
...me lot of wealth but only two
hands to donate.

294
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Wish God had given me thousand
hands for that purpose

295
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:08,610
Let God do good to you

296
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:22,090
Mother, you have given me
everything, still I come...

297
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:28,000
...as a beggar to your temple
to pray to you to give me...

298
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:33,230
...a good daughter-in-law
as you gave all other things.

299
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:39,000
I don't need any dowry, but
only a Lakshmi (Goddess of...

300
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:47,620
...wealth) as a daughter-in-law.
Give me that, mother.

301
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,060
Go
-Yes, sir

302
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:17,270
Sir, Car's tyre is punctured
-ls there no spare tyre.

303
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:19,670
Only one, but two are punctured.

304
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:23,000
I had to go to an important
meeting, what to do?

305
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,450
Brother, If you don't mind,
I will drop you in my car

306
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:28,000
Why should you be troubled?

307
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:31,510
Today at least give Vada-Pav
to fill the stomach

308
00:46:31,870 --> 00:46:35,530
Rs. 100-, how in beggar's hands
-Got it from your father

309
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:45,730
This is illegal note. Go away.
Will handover to the police

310
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:28,120
He made me fools and
gave illegal notes

311
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:36,020
I am Mehra, -I am
called Hazari Prasad

312
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:39,550
I have not seen you before
in this town. Are you new here?

313
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:45,000
I belong here. But for business,
we have to leave our country

314
00:47:45,770 --> 00:47:48,000
By the way, what is your
business?

315
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:54,230
Not much, 4 textile mills, some
shipping corpn. & some industry.

316
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:59,000
All small-small businesses.
-Small! You joke very well.

317
00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:02,660
What are you doing today
evening?-Nothing,

318
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:07,690
Let us have a drink
-Let us meet and mix

319
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:27,280
Long live our friendship
-ln the name of our friendship

320
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:36,640
Why has'nt Mr. Mehra come
yet?-He is usually very punctual

321
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,010
Comes daily at 9..00.
Don't know why he is late

322
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:47,440
Remember the dialogues- Yes
-Let us start

323
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:53,450
What do you think of yourself?
You think I am a greedy fraud?

324
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:57,000
What is the matter?
Why are you upset?

325
00:48:57,180 --> 00:49:01,410
Mr. Mehra, I had told Panditji
to get me a daughter-in-law...

326
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:05,510
...of good virtues even if she
is only with oneset of clothes

327
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
But he is bringing alliances of
millionaires and billionaires...

328
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:15,450
...who want to buy my son.
Money can't give good virtues

329
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,020
If you don't mind, shall l
tell something?

330
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:24,000
Definitely, that is your right.

331
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I know a girl who has virtues
you want in a daughter-in-law

332
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:33,570
Tell me where she is, I will
be grateful to you lifelong.

333
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:35,840
My Daughter!

334
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:39,520
Yours?

335
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:42,800
Why are you quiet?

336
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,020
Tell your opinion frankly,
there is no binding at all.

337
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:50,020
Mr. Mehra, from today,
our friendship is finished

338
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:55,950
As we are going
to become close relations now

339
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:08,000
You joke well-This is fate,
girl is inside the house...

340
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,870
...but we are searching the
whole city.

341
00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:11,740
Match the horoscopes fast,
if they match, you will get...

342
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:16,740
...everything, understood?-Sir,
give your daughter's horoscope

343
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,850
I don't have that?- Then
tell her birth date & time

344
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:25,050
I remember that. On 8th January,
1981, it used to dew.

345
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:38,670
The horoscopes matched well
congratulations to both of you

346
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:45,600
There are 64 matches. Like this
only Ram-Sita's and...

347
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:48,000
... Shiv-Parvati's horoscope
matched.

348
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,790
Like that Raja's & Madhu's
horoscopes have matched

349
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,000
What do you think of yourself?

350
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:30,000
A lone one

351
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:34,800
You laugh at others, if you
are a man, dance with me

352
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:38,000
I have told you before, l
don't mix with girls

353
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:41,180
Only if you are a man,
you will do that

354
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:00,790
Please come
Mr. Mehra will just come

355
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,670
Dad, where have you brought me
-I have convinced this...

356
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:08,800
...man with great difficulty-How
will I marry an unknown girl?

357
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:11,250
I also married like that, you will
also do the same & shut up

358
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:17,170
Then I will shout.
-My dear son!

359
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:19,430
What a scene, father and
son's affection is great

360
00:53:19,710 --> 00:53:21,820
I felt like hugging my son

361
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:27,180
This is my mother
-He is my son Raja

362
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:32,260
Where is your daughter?
-Took the dog for a walk

363
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:36,130
Hello Daddy- come

364
00:53:36,610 --> 00:53:39,340
This is Hazari Prasad,
your would-be father-in-law

365
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:41,990
This is his son, Raja
- Son...

366
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:45,810
Você?

367
00:53:45,810 --> 00:53:47,470
You know each other?

368
00:53:47,470 --> 00:53:52,950
Dad you want me to marry this
rowdy. Not even worth my dog

369
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:58,000
I will marry this dog, but not
you, I can't marry this witch

370
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:03,230
I am a witch-Since you know
each other, there is no problem

371
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:06,550
Congrats- Shut up- Don't tell my
dad to shut up

372
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:12,710
Madhu, what are you doing?
-Grandma, he is a big rowdy

373
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:16,100
Yes, you are very innocent!
-What are you doing, son?

374
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:18,730
Why you are spoiling all my
plans? For god's sake keep quiet

375
00:54:18,770 --> 00:54:22,870
Dad, I will see to this lizard
-You called me a lizard.

376
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:26,570
Dad, you move! You cockroach

377
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:37,750
You did this to my dad?
I will not leave you

378
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:49,010
- Look, dad. Cake for cake
You did this to my dad?

379
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:51,200
You bloody rascal!

380
00:54:56,360 --> 00:55:02,640
I will see to you lizard
-I will not leave him

381
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:10,010
I am going now, I can't
wait even for a moment here.

382
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:41,380
I will die, my end is near and
my son is responsible for that

383
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:45,400
Control yourself, or your
condition will worsen

384
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:50,000
What is there to worsen now?
Lift this moutain a little

385
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:57,300
Crores are lost. He kicked the
Lakshmi (wealth). Useless son.

386
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:04,740
I will not leave my son. I will
bury him alive. Where is he?

387
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,000
There he is, I will kill him
-What are you doing?

388
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:25,810
No need to kill me. You will get
death penalty then.

389
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:29,660
For your happiness, I will
myself commit suicide

390
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:39,650
This knife has cut lot of things
but today I will be cut.

391
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:45,630
What are you doing, son?
-Let me die, mother

392
00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:47,920
Whom are you threatening,
die now?

393
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:51,770
Are father and son like this?
-ls he a son- Is he a father?

394
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:57,550
You have to marry that girl
-I will not marry that witch

395
00:56:57,550 --> 00:57:00,480
Your dad will also do that
-Than do that?

396
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:09,360
Are you mad, if our young son
does anything, we will be bereft

397
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:19,730
I will not accept defeat so
easily. You will wed that girl

398
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:30,300
Don't feel bad, Hazari, nowadays
young men don't listen to parents

399
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:35,130
We should not compel our
children

400
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,770
Call your daughter, she might
listen to me

401
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:46,660
My daughter is going on a tour
to Ooty with friends tomorrow

402
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:49,520
We will talk, when she comes.

403
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:09,000
Asha, you know, one came to my
house with a wish to marry me

404
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:14,810
What happened, then?-He was
rejected even by my dog.

405
00:58:17,810 --> 00:58:23,560
His head was hit by sandals so
much that, his children will...

406
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:26,450
...also be born bald

407
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:55,190
Cover this camera properly
-Bring my things, please

408
00:58:55,370 --> 00:58:57,900
I will just go to the loo

409
00:58:59,150 --> 00:59:01,580
I will also just come

410
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:10,790
The girl was young, had
to go to Japan, went to China

411
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:31,780
So Angry she was. She will
remember U always in toilet.

412
01:00:33,650 --> 01:00:39,040
Your room has come, Raja
-Good night

413
01:01:05,930 --> 01:01:08,960
Save me!
-Who is that?

414
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:31,060
Leave me for God's sake

415
01:01:39,510 --> 01:01:44,000
He forcefully entered my room
and tried to rape me, sir

416
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:48,190
If you had not come,
I can't imagine my condition

417
01:01:49,610 --> 01:01:54,400
Sir, I did'nt do anything, ask her
what she is doing in my room

418
01:01:54,450 --> 01:02:00,000
Stop this nonsense, this is room
no.6, see properly

419
01:02:04,450 --> 01:02:08,530
Sir, this is her game,
she is lying

420
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:16,000
Get lost from here. Don't show
me your black face again.

421
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:19,660
You all go to your rooms

422
01:03:51,490 --> 01:03:55,020
You blamed that
I tried to rape you

423
01:03:56,910 --> 01:04:01,650
I will teach you that today.

424
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:08,010
Beware, don't try to
touch me.

425
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:28,690
Beware, stop, don't come forward.

426
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:41,630
Is there anyone? Save!

427
01:06:02,890 --> 01:06:08,420
Please let me go and
forgive me.

428
01:06:09,390 --> 01:06:15,340
This is a matter of my prestige.
Please forgive me.

429
01:06:22,210 --> 01:06:26,370
Please forgive me
and let me go

430
01:06:43,150 --> 01:06:46,280
Understand what is rape?

431
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:51,390
Those ladies who go through...

432
01:06:55,840 --> 01:07:01,000
...this rape, their body as well
as soul is hurt.

433
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:17,650
And you easily blamed me for
rape, which was just a word...

434
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:24,000
...for you, but it has spoiled
my whole life.

435
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:28,020
I have fallen before people's eye.

436
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:31,500
You have destroyed my prestige...

437
01:07:31,530 --> 01:07:33,590
...respect. But I can't do that.

438
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,970
But cannot play with their
prestige

439
01:08:03,310 --> 01:08:05,000
Go away from here

440
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:02,440
Remember one thing. Do not
repeat this mistake again.

441
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:06,340
As every boy may not be Raja.

442
01:09:20,290 --> 01:09:26,070
You did'nt do right. This could
have destroyed Raja's life

443
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:55,380
The climate here is so nice.
Don't feel like going back.

444
01:10:05,570 --> 01:10:09,770
What happened Madhu?- Looks,
as if I sprained my leg

445
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:13,710
It is paining a lot.

446
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:27,970
Not with so much force

447
01:10:38,190 --> 01:10:40,790
What happened to her,
now only she was shouting

448
01:11:16,030 --> 01:11:18,990
- Nothing
-What is written?

449
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:35,480
Looks the whole night will
go dancing only.

450
01:11:47,730 --> 01:11:52,540
Divya, tell Raja to come & meet
me in the lawn behind the hotel

451
01:11:57,660 --> 01:12:01,640
Raja, Madhu wants to speak
to you

452
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:07,020
Tell her, I don't want to meet her

453
01:12:09,710 --> 01:12:12,320
Raja refused, I am sorry

454
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:40,000
I am not getting any sleep

455
01:13:40,210 --> 01:13:46,450
I am not getting any peace.

456
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:03,050
I am not getting any sleep

457
01:14:05,170 --> 01:14:08,360
I am not getting any peace.

458
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:11,000
Please somebody go and
search for my heart.

459
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:22,690
Don't know where my heart
is lost

460
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,310
I am not getting any sleep
I am not getting any peace.

461
01:14:27,330 --> 01:14:29,950
Please somebody go and
search for my heart.

462
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:43,170
Don't know where my
heart is lost

463
01:15:14,970 --> 01:15:20,770
How do I tell my
condition to you?

464
01:15:21,230 --> 01:15:27,000
I keep changing sides and
spend the night

465
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:36,630
How do I tell my
condition to you?

466
01:15:36,980 --> 01:15:43,020
I keep changing sides and
spend the night

467
01:15:43,390 --> 01:15:46,500
Please ask me what
is my condition.

468
01:15:46,540 --> 01:15:55,350
My condition is very bad

469
01:15:55,570 --> 01:16:01,000
Nobody is able to understand
or stop that.

470
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:03,840
Don't know where l
have lost my heart?

471
01:16:04,450 --> 01:16:14,600
Don't know where I have
lost my heart?

472
01:16:58,530 --> 01:17:04,000
My heart is more dear to
me than my life

473
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:10,000
It is difficult to live even
one moment without my heart.

474
01:17:14,150 --> 01:17:19,440
My heart is more dear to
me than my life

475
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:26,000
It is difficult to live even
one moment without my heart.

476
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:38,820
What is this pain?
This pain is heartless.

477
01:17:38,910 --> 01:17:42,040
Sometimes it makes me laugh
and sometimes makes me cry

478
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:44,600
Somebody go and search
for it

479
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:51,030
I don't know, where l
have lost my heart

480
01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:57,370
I am not getting any sleep

481
01:17:57,420 --> 01:18:04,070
I am not getting any peace.

482
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:13,430
I am not getting any sleep
I am not getting any peace.

483
01:18:13,430 --> 01:18:16,000
Please somebody go and
search for my heart.

484
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:22,050
Don't know where my
heart is lost

485
01:18:59,540 --> 01:19:03,350
Why have you come inside
-Telegram, sir

486
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:06,000
Definitely you must have
brought some bad news.

487
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,000
You did'nt give for Diwali this time
-Here I am broken...

488
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,400
...you talk about Diwali.
Give me that.

489
01:19:12,030 --> 01:19:18,000
Lord, please take care of
me. Don't give me any bad news

490
01:19:20,830 --> 01:19:22,030
What happened?

491
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,650
Madam, come fast, he is panting?

492
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:39,000
What happened to you?

493
01:19:39,570 --> 01:19:44,000
Either my name is not Hazari,
or I have no son named Raja

494
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,080
Somebody has played a bad
joke on me.

495
01:19:50,470 --> 01:19:54,000
It is not a joke. It is nice that
Raja & Madhu want to marry
