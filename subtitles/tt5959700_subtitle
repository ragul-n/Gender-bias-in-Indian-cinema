00:03:14,025 --> 00:03:15,141
Focus!

Focus on your work

00:03:41,593 --> 00:03:43,552
Pack fast

4
00:03:43,677 --> 00:03:45,385
Double up! Double up!

00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:52,216
Brother, you are being so gentle
Are you writing some poetry?

7
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:52,824

Before I say something You idiot.
Pack fast

9
00:03:55,968 --> 00:03:58,927
Look according to you This
might be a pantry car

10
00:03:59,635 --> 00:04:02,968
- But to me it's a paramilitary force
- Yes sir!

11
00:04:03,802 --> 00:04:05,478
What was that?

12
00:04:05,503 --> 00:04:06,503
Who was it?

13
00:04:08,111 --> 00:04:10,034
Why this emotion?

14
00:04:10,059 --> 00:04:11,809
You just mentioned it's
a paramilitary force

15
00:04:12,593 --> 00:04:15,385
Look! Playing around with words

16
00:04:15,942 --> 00:04:18,317
Pretending to work when
you see the manager

17
00:04:18,702 --> 00:04:20,879
I don't want any more
of these gimmicks

18
00:04:20,904 --> 00:04:23,662

00:04:31,843 --> 00:04:33,343
- What's this?
- It's a radio

23
00:04:33,718 --> 00:04:36,302
- Will we get all the FM stations in this?
- Don't provoke me

24
00:04:36,385 --> 00:04:38,989
Don't you know about walkie talkie?
- No sir!

25
00:04:39,014 --> 00:04:41,052
With this device you can
talk to each other easily

26
00:04:41,077 --> 00:04:43,494
- Can I talk to my grandma in the village?

Vairam No 9

30
00:04:55,648 --> 00:04:56,648

00:04:57,216 --> 00:05:00,299
You are taking 2, give back one

32
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,677

00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:21,009
Now I know - Still
you don't know

38
00:05:21,927 --> 00:05:24,272
When the person on this
side completes speaking and

39
00:05:24,297 --> 00:05:26,838
say OVER The person on that
side should start talking

40
00:05:27,052 --> 00:05:29,052

41
00:05:29,277 --> 00:05:30,652
Hey just shut up

42
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:31,958

43
00:05:32,228 --> 00:05:34,270
No sir!

44
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:37,885
Some of you have just joined I
need to give you the pantry rules

45
00:05:38,277 --> 00:05:43,146
Rule no 1 - Under no circumstances should
the complaint register reach the passengers

46
00:05:43,171 --> 00:05:44,171
Then rule no 2?

47
00:05:45,177 --> 00:05:46,177
Hey you tell them

48
00:05:46,202 --> 00:05:49,118
Be it tea or coffee, when the
customers drinks it and says

00:05:49,155 --> 00:05:51,864
its like water It's tastes
horrible and throws it out

50
00:05:52,335 --> 00:05:53,335
Wipe it off!

51
00:05:53,677 --> 00:05:57,885
No you should wipe it and smile Say
thank you sir, thank you madam, bye bye

52
00:05:58,212 --> 00:06:01,042
If the passengers join together and ask
us to bring that unscrupulous manager?

53
00:06:01,066 --> 00:06:02,527
Hand him over

54
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:04,389
Hey you should just fled
That's the main rule

00:06:04,424 --> 00:06:08,460
Under no circumstances should I be caught
by the customers, You should protect me

56
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:11,358
For that you can say any amount of
lies and do whatever you feel like,

57
00:06:11,383 --> 00:06:12,716
Only for that

58
00:06:13,092 --> 00:06:16,522
Then we will spread the news
that manager has swine flu

59
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,985

- Get lost, Get lost get

66
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,774
Unable to judge

67
00:06:38,627 --> 00:06:39,978
He's an innocent boy

68
00:06:48,317 --> 00:06:51,900
Idli vadai ( South Indian snack)
Pongal vadai ( South Indian snack)

69
00:06:52,135 --> 00:06:55,385
1 pongal vadai and 2 idli vadai

70
00:06:55,688 --> 00:06:58,266
- Can you please confirm a berth for this?
- Wait

00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,771

75
00:07:10,843 --> 00:07:12,260
When will she come?

76
00:07:13,385 --> 00:07:16,760
Who do you think I am? Jhansi
is the name of the next station

77
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:20,420
Hey! Move Let's just have a look

78
00:07:22,871 --> 00:07:24,246
Behave your age

79
00:07:24,564 --> 00:07:27,155
Tea Masala tea

80
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,814
Look you both are fighting
You both stand aside

81
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:32,111
You want to go past
me as I go aside

82
00:07:34,603 --> 00:07:37,520
Why are you all gathered here?
Is the door locked

83
00:07:38,052 --> 00:07:39,103
What's the problem?

84
00:07:39,128 --> 00:07:41,128
It's a small problem, you'll
blow it up, You leave!

85
00:07:41,624 --> 00:07:43,291
I thought I can hear
one of your poetry

86
00:07:43,722 --> 00:07:48,185
In the D coupe Srisha has come So we
are contemplating who should go in?

87
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,210
Actress Srisha

88
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:56,218
Is this the problem? Because an actress is
here you all have assembled and discussing

89
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:59,001
In the general compartment
there's no one to

90
00:07:59,026 --> 00:08:01,609
take care of the service Aren't
you ashamed? Go get to work

91
00:08:01,994 --> 00:08:03,861
It's Srisha right?
I'll take care

92
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:06,398
That's what we are fighting for,
and you will just walk through

93
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,274
Listen you are all juniors
I am senior by age

94
00:08:10,299 --> 00:08:12,430
What senior? What will
you do going there?

95
00:08:12,455 --> 00:08:14,007
If I go I will recite a
poem, will quickly take a

96
00:08:14,031 --> 00:08:16,281
selfie and then will take
you all And get a groupie

97
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:19,646
If she hears your poetry she will
commit suicide from the running train

98
00:08:19,671 --> 00:08:21,529
Can't I take a selfie

99
00:08:21,554 --> 00:08:24,260
Hello can't we take a selfie?

100
00:08:24,285 --> 00:08:27,447
It's a girls thing? Why do you
get involved? Just leave it

101
00:08:27,635 --> 00:08:28,885
Are you kidding me?

102
00:08:29,287 --> 00:08:31,248
If I don't get a
selfie with Srisha

103
00:08:31,273 --> 00:08:33,065
Captain calling Mic 9
where are you? Over

104
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:34,326
In S5

105
00:08:34,374 --> 00:08:36,458
There's a person in S5

106
00:08:36,686 --> 00:08:37,794
Go check again

107
00:08:37,819 --> 00:08:40,138
There's no one in B2 as well

108
00:08:40,163 --> 00:08:42,163
What? Don't get angry
Where are you?

109
00:08:42,872 --> 00:08:44,083
Where are you?

110
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,213
I am in B2

111
00:08:46,238 --> 00:08:47,904
There's a person in B2

112
00:08:47,929 --> 00:08:49,463
He's lying Go check for yourself

113
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:52,581
- What kind of pantry are you running?
- Where the hell are you guys?

114
00:08:53,072 --> 00:08:56,430
Why are you guys so frivolous and
standing idle in front of this door?

115
00:08:56,455 --> 00:08:58,610
Supervisor, you too?

116
00:08:58,635 --> 00:09:01,468
At least let this
Poochiappan work

117
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,246
Suddenly he's talking
like a earnest man

118
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:05,270
Not earnest I am innocent

119
00:09:05,858 --> 00:09:10,502
All of you stand like this in front of
this place, The pantry will go bankrupt

120
00:09:10,527 --> 00:09:12,831
I though I got a
sincere assistant

121
00:09:12,989 --> 00:09:15,629
I didn't realise that I got an
assistant who is an informer as well

122
00:09:16,619 --> 00:09:18,386
Hey Old man! Why are
you killing us?

123
00:09:18,411 --> 00:09:20,286
Whose old? ( arguments)

124
00:09:21,967 --> 00:09:23,139
Where are you? Over

125
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,834

00:09:26,689 --> 00:09:28,889
Rules needs to be followed.

127
00:09:29,811 --> 00:09:30,936
Can you hear me?

128
00:09:31,853 --> 00:09:33,228
Can't hear. Over

129
00:09:36,177 --> 00:09:38,218
Can you hear me?

130
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,920
Can't hear. Over

131
00:09:42,099 --> 00:09:43,170
I won't let anyone

132
00:09:45,423 --> 00:09:46,423

133
00:09:46,874 --> 00:09:48,201

135
00:09:58,942 --> 00:10:01,983
Are you a supervisor or Spider-Man?
You are stuck to it?

136
00:10:02,093 --> 00:10:03,093
What's all this?

137
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,978
Welcome drink

138
00:10:06,052 --> 00:10:09,309
In A1 you haven't even
given the welcome drink?

139
00:10:09,334 --> 00:10:11,324
Actress Srisha is here

140
00:10:12,407 --> 00:10:14,657
It's correct time to connect her

141
00:10:15,177 --> 00:10:18,802
Is Srisha some legend? If an actress is here
will you all drop your jaws and just stare

142
00:10:21,155 --> 00:10:23,822
- Which Coupe?

143
00:10:24,986 --> 00:10:27,569

Sir I am busy serving a customer. If I

00:10:32,783 --> 00:10:35,663
If you don't come my life will be disrupted
- Okay sir! on your feet sir!

147
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:40,260
- In D coupe Srisha is there - Who
is Srisha sir? Your relative?

148
00:10:41,218 --> 00:10:44,218
- Don't you know artist Srisha?
- The one who draws?

149
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:45,791
The actress

150
00:10:45,986 --> 00:10:48,319
Why are you all standing here.
Get to work

151
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,491
You take care of A1 coupe

152
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:52,905
Sir I decide whom to
allot the work for

153
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:54,687
I get to decide
who will be fired

154
00:10:57,694 --> 00:11:03,458
You moron! Only last week your
grand daughter got married

155
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:05,096
Then who is he?

156
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,348
You are still here?
Give the tray to him

157
00:11:08,373 --> 00:11:09,456
Give him the tea

158
00:11:11,385 --> 00:11:14,877
- You go see her all alone - Dear
poet we will take care you can move

159
00:11:14,902 --> 00:11:16,495
You take care of yourself sir

160
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:23,218
My aim in life is to romance
and marry an actress

161
00:11:25,653 --> 00:11:26,736
It's drizzling

162
00:11:27,075 --> 00:11:28,491
Good omen

163
00:11:28,968 --> 00:11:32,760
Srisha's last movie "Why shield your
head when you are fully drenched"

164
00:11:33,802 --> 00:11:36,343
Each and every details where...

165
00:11:38,052 --> 00:11:40,648
The dialogues! Awesome

166
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:44,372
In that movie she's mute sir
- You said you didn't know?

167
00:11:45,366 --> 00:11:47,908
Then, the service should be good

168
00:11:48,025 --> 00:11:49,358
No complaint should arise

169
00:11:49,606 --> 00:11:53,939
Also, you go to the kitchen and tell them
Not to re use the oil they have used once

170
00:11:55,010 --> 00:12:00,948
And anything that you give press it and say
that manager asked me to give it to you

171
00:12:00,973 --> 00:12:03,764
- But she should agree for it, isn't it?
- Brother!

172
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:07,186
I told only to press on the word Manager
- Okay sir!

173
00:12:07,671 --> 00:12:09,902
You are so innocent - I
grew up that way Sir

174
00:12:09,927 --> 00:12:12,218

346
00:24:41,406 --> 00:24:44,615
I'll put it on speaker
Talk to him

347
00:24:44,974 --> 00:24:45,974
Hello!

348
00:24:48,495 --> 00:24:49,287
I like you

349
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:52,005
Sister the groom's family have come back

350
00:24:52,406 --> 00:24:54,443
It's true They are here see!

351
00:24:54,468 --> 00:24:57,845
Brother I did not believe
you when you told me

352
00:24:58,049 --> 00:25:00,049
Even I didn't expect this
- You are a God to us

353
00:25:00,773 --> 00:25:02,898
You should definitely visit us

354
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,126
Why?

355
00:25:04,151 --> 00:25:07,026
There are several girls
here who are unmarried

356
00:25:07,601 --> 00:25:11,601
If he just comes once and says he likes them
Their marriages will be fixed immediately

357
00:25:11,995 --> 00:25:14,870
I will definitely bring him
Don't worry

358
00:25:15,287 --> 00:25:17,787
You shouldn't cry

359
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:23,226
Your luck spell is unbelievable
Even I didn't expect it to be so quick

360
00:25:23,453 --> 00:25:26,287
Just as you said After this trip
just come once to my hometown

361
00:25:26,495 --> 00:25:28,162
Are you mocking me?

362
00:25:28,643 --> 00:25:31,851
Wait and see before we reach the
destination I will make her fall for me

363
00:25:33,427 --> 00:25:35,552
Just as you speak about
your fate look at the gloom

364
00:25:36,153 --> 00:25:38,153
That girl will get down in Thada

365
00:25:39,787 --> 00:25:41,203
Serious about her

366
00:25:45,006 --> 00:25:48,673
Even as I talk about other girls
I know from within I am lying

367
00:25:49,377 --> 00:25:51,752
But as I think about this girl

368
00:25:55,953 --> 00:26:00,078
Something happens within but you are
unable to find words to express

369
00:26:01,562 --> 00:26:03,771
Then it's definitely love
I will help you

370
00:26:04,065 --> 00:26:05,065
How will you help?

371
00:26:05,315 --> 00:26:07,940
I will give you a poetry loaded
with emotions Give it to her

372
00:26:08,729 --> 00:26:10,729
It will work

373
00:26:13,944 --> 00:26:14,944
Here

374
00:26:23,924 --> 00:26:24,924
Damsel

375
00:26:31,354 --> 00:26:33,312
Damsel
- Again Damsel!

376
00:26:33,881 --> 00:26:36,089
Don't interrupt!

377
00:26:44,575 --> 00:26:47,366
Have I ever scolded your mother?
Don't make me do it, Leave!

378
00:26:48,088 --> 00:26:51,213
Damsel damsel damsel
If you repeat the same words is it a poem

379
00:26:51,732 --> 00:26:53,357
Take this and leave
I think you are upset

380
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:55,620
It's coming very well I
will call and tell you

381
00:26:55,645 --> 00:26:57,372
Even I am having a
uninterrupted flow get lost

382
00:26:57,396 --> 00:27:01,854
But even I didn't expect that my
sister will get married so soon Thanks

383
00:27:02,318 --> 00:27:04,026
Definitely visit my hometown

384
00:27:04,482 --> 00:27:07,148
There's something very average
that I have, you will like it

385
00:27:07,924 --> 00:27:12,716
Girl girl girl, - Get lost
- You are insulting a great lyricist

386
00:27:22,552 --> 00:27:24,843
- What's this?
- Heart - Will someone fall for this?

387
00:27:25,662 --> 00:27:27,578
This is a heart - Someone
will fall for this?

388
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,412
When I teaching you
learn don't preach

389
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,578
Tell her as you serve

390
00:27:35,804 --> 00:27:37,720
- What should I tell?
- Say it's my heart

391
00:27:37,775 --> 00:27:39,358
I will say it's my heart

392
00:27:40,287 --> 00:27:42,578
If he says its his heart?

393
00:27:43,576 --> 00:27:44,576
Innocent boy

394
00:27:54,242 --> 00:27:59,576
Madam you sang a song for Anirudh in
how many takes did you complete it?

395
00:27:59,653 --> 00:28:01,153
Each will go for 5-6 takes

396
00:28:01,326 --> 00:28:02,451
5-6?

397
00:28:03,122 --> 00:28:05,803
I can sing each in a single take

398
00:28:05,874 --> 00:28:10,416
In that song there's a place in the second
stanza where it goes in a lower note

399
00:28:10,864 --> 00:28:13,447
In the auto tune mode it will be tuned

400
00:28:14,018 --> 00:28:17,060
Even if you sing in a terrible
voice it can be corrected

401
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:20,670
I don't need auto tune

402
00:28:21,184 --> 00:28:24,188
I can sign myself
- Are you Shreya Goshal

403
00:28:24,213 --> 00:28:27,470
Mother as madam is going
for recording can she

404
00:28:28,011 --> 00:28:31,525
mention to Composer Anirudh
that I can sign well

405
00:28:37,857 --> 00:28:40,232
Is it cutlet? Bring it

406
00:28:41,315 --> 00:28:43,273
Saroja hold this pet

407
00:28:49,591 --> 00:28:50,591
Cutlet

408
00:28:52,325 --> 00:28:53,866
Specially made for you

409
00:29:03,193 --> 00:29:04,193
Hello Pantry

410
00:29:06,815 --> 00:29:09,065
- What's this?
- Cutlet - That I know

411
00:29:09,555 --> 00:29:11,930
Why for others it's round
and for me in a heart shape

412
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:14,976
There's just one heart can I give
it to everyone, so gave it to you

413
00:29:15,245 --> 00:29:17,596
- Then this arrow?
- How can you have a heart without an arrow

414
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:21,162
I don't want this stunt
of heart with an arrow

415
00:29:21,576 --> 00:29:25,302
This is the last warning
Hereafter give everything in the same shape

416
00:29:25,327 --> 00:29:26,786
Are you all in the same shape?

417
00:29:26,828 --> 00:29:28,787
Do you know who am I?

418
00:29:29,179 --> 00:29:30,304
Side kick!

419
00:29:30,495 --> 00:29:33,162
I am a vessel you
are an umbrella

420
00:29:34,649 --> 00:29:37,046
Next year in the same first class

421
00:29:38,226 --> 00:29:39,810
No I will be on the flight

422
00:29:39,835 --> 00:29:42,627
How can I see when you are flying,
will you travel on the foot board?

423
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:44,773
I will fly on the wings

424
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:49,029
Saroja can't you hear me!
Come here!

425
00:29:54,432 --> 00:29:57,845
Poochi You?

426
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:59,193
Instead of hanging
like this you can..

427
00:29:59,217 --> 00:30:01,675
You look like the legend actor
Shivaji from the movie Manohara

428
00:30:02,708 --> 00:30:04,708
Why are you after Insects?

429
00:30:05,353 --> 00:30:08,270
He's now my student

430
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:11,341
He has taken my heart
in the form of a cutlet

431
00:30:12,361 --> 00:30:15,111
Seeing that Srisha
- Srisha

432
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:22,178
She will want to see the man

433
00:30:22,415 --> 00:30:25,445
You won't take to offense if I
say something She's an actress

434
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:28,720
and would have come across several
handsome enterprising people

435
00:30:28,745 --> 00:30:31,720
Why will she fall for you

436
00:30:31,931 --> 00:30:34,062
- Jealousy - Every dog
and ghost will like an

437
00:30:34,087 --> 00:30:35,847
actress Why, even the
actress will like a dog

438
00:30:36,231 --> 00:30:37,231
Get lost!

439
00:30:38,061 --> 00:30:39,436
Hey poet come here

440
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:42,779
Is there any poetry that
will flatter her instantly

441
00:30:42,804 --> 00:30:44,387
Of course it will charm her immediately

442
00:30:44,412 --> 00:30:46,037
A lover's garden

443
00:30:46,372 --> 00:30:49,205
No need, It's sailing smooth
you will make it a dump yard

444
00:30:50,763 --> 00:30:52,443
You won't get down without being slippered

445
00:30:54,487 --> 00:30:56,071
Poochiappan

446
00:30:56,096 --> 00:30:59,138
I was waiting for you
Come inside

447
00:30:59,828 --> 00:31:01,828
Why is half the heart here?

448
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:04,068
It's hers,

449
00:31:04,093 --> 00:31:06,010
told me to give it to you

450
00:31:06,552 --> 00:31:08,552
Srisha?
Her mother

451
00:31:08,787 --> 00:31:11,745
- Told her my age
If I send him this is bound to happen

452
00:31:12,271 --> 00:31:14,604
- Minimize it
- Age? - Your conversations..

453
00:31:15,557 --> 00:31:17,432
Get up and get to work Thanks

454
00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:21,257
If I ask him to tame the
calf he's feeding the cow

455
00:31:24,245 --> 00:31:26,078
Efforts will yield results

456
00:31:26,318 --> 00:31:28,859
You are the messenger

457
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,084
What I am saying is true

458
00:31:31,287 --> 00:31:32,662
Just shut up and do your work

459
00:31:35,451 --> 00:31:37,887
He's a military man and
you have made him Cupid

460
00:31:37,943 --> 00:31:40,484
Just do your work
Do it properly without spilling

461
00:31:42,037 --> 00:31:43,620
Sir, you draw the heart without dancing

462
00:31:43,745 --> 00:31:45,870
I have done it Nice

463
00:31:47,245 --> 00:31:51,203
What dear you are helping me I
should be thanking you - Okay sir

464
00:31:51,796 --> 00:31:53,428
This time give it to the right person

465
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:56,078
What should I say this time?

466
00:31:56,882 --> 00:31:58,382
Nothing is springing up instantly

467
00:31:58,450 --> 00:31:59,830
I have something springing up instantly

468
00:31:59,854 --> 00:32:01,771
- Tell
- You won't take it to offense

469
00:32:02,812 --> 00:32:05,271
We don't need to consult
with this crazy fellow

470
00:32:05,992 --> 00:32:07,284
What can we tell?

471
00:32:10,859 --> 00:32:13,095
You are in love
- Yes I am

472
00:32:13,262 --> 00:32:15,137
- You feel something
- Yes - Say that and give

473
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,281
- That's what I am going to do
- Excellent

474
00:32:18,866 --> 00:32:22,720
They are laughing without even
knowing what we are talking about

475
00:32:22,846 --> 00:32:26,721
They are like that Crazy fellow!
Crazy fellows!

476
00:32:27,906 --> 00:32:31,323
Before the heart melts take it
This time strike the right target

477
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,120
You will do it right this time

478
00:32:34,982 --> 00:32:35,982
Move it!

479
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:42,927
He's in a hurry and saying such things

480
00:33:17,612 --> 00:33:18,612
Soup

481
00:33:21,826 --> 00:33:23,826
You have stirred it

482
00:33:23,953 --> 00:33:26,870
Stir it well and drink
Then you will have the energy to scold

483
00:33:29,239 --> 00:33:32,405
Vairamuth Sir ( famous lyricist)

487
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,995
Is it lyricist Vairamuthu?

488
00:33:43,703 --> 00:33:44,828
Hello Poochi

489
00:33:47,903 --> 00:33:49,319
Yes he's my close friend

490
00:33:49,604 --> 00:33:50,604
What sir?

491
00:33:51,198 --> 00:33:52,490
Doubt?
- Doubt!

492
00:33:52,856 --> 00:33:55,564
Sir, it's a lot of disturbance
here, let me come out

493
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:02,345
Dude, I will listen to
whatever poetry you have

494
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:05,553
In this shock I am unable
to have my flow of thought

495
00:34:05,578 --> 00:34:08,658
Even if we book a room and listen, you
are not going to have a flow of thought

496
00:34:08,703 --> 00:34:10,162
One minute friend

497
00:34:10,412 --> 00:34:12,828
In your lovely tress I
will pick the flowers

498
00:34:13,166 --> 00:34:15,749
- What are you saying?
- It's very cliched

499
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,638
You can try something better

500
00:34:19,882 --> 00:34:20,882
What sir?

501
00:34:21,578 --> 00:34:23,287
This seems very stale

502
00:34:24,537 --> 00:34:27,745
One minute sir
In your cascading tress I will catch fish

503
00:34:29,523 --> 00:34:31,096
In your cascading tress I will catch fish

504
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,120
It has already come

505
00:34:32,162 --> 00:34:33,828
You are asking me to copy

506
00:34:34,052 --> 00:34:36,686
- Why are you being formal and thanking me
- Will you listen to my poem

507
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:38,430
How can I come up with another poem so soon

508
00:34:38,498 --> 00:34:41,058
You didn't even listen to it
- I will call after I finish writing

509
00:34:48,596 --> 00:34:51,262
- What do you want?
- You know Vairamuthu Sir?

510
00:34:51,287 --> 00:34:53,262
You think my conversation
so long was all fake

511
00:34:53,287 --> 00:34:54,287
- No
- Saved

512
00:34:54,841 --> 00:34:58,049
How do you know Vairamuthu Sir?

513
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:04,220
Just like this, like how you are
traveling 6 months before, he was

514
00:35:04,245 --> 00:35:07,308
traveling in the same coupe after
receiving the national award

515
00:35:07,558 --> 00:35:09,306
I used to go frequently for his service

516
00:35:09,401 --> 00:35:12,401
Once when I went for service I
saw he was stagnant with ideas

517
00:35:12,781 --> 00:35:13,781
What!

518
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:17,078
I asked him what his problem was

519
00:35:17,851 --> 00:35:21,226
He said there was an interruption
in his flow of thoughts - For Him!

520
00:35:21,374 --> 00:35:22,374
For me

521
00:35:22,872 --> 00:35:24,872
Then I told him 4 lines

522
00:35:25,418 --> 00:35:27,513
He instantly said that this
is poetry and incorporated it

523
00:35:27,537 --> 00:35:30,828
Pantry sir! Wow

524
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:33,779
That's our friendship

525
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:36,810
Whenever he's stuck he will call

526
00:35:37,529 --> 00:35:38,529
Are you so close?

527
00:35:41,023 --> 00:35:42,523
Of late it's getting stuck frequently

528
00:35:43,296 --> 00:35:45,713
Unable to work properly For sir

529
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:48,731
Even now, He said something
like I will take

530
00:35:48,793 --> 00:35:51,251
flowers from your tress,
Told him it's very stale

531
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:54,013
Then told him will catch fish from your
cascading tress Told me it's fresh

532
00:35:54,037 --> 00:35:56,037
Can I talk to Vairamuthu sir?

533
00:35:56,317 --> 00:35:57,583
You won't believe

534
00:35:57,608 --> 00:36:01,303
Not that
He knows several music directors

535
00:36:01,328 --> 00:36:04,495
He can recommend me for a chance to sing

536
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:07,411
You want to be a singer?

537
00:36:07,436 --> 00:36:08,676
Being a singer you want to.....

538
00:36:13,451 --> 00:36:15,785
You want to talk to Vairamuthu sir?

539
00:36:20,491 --> 00:36:24,575
- Sir - Damsel damsel damsel
- No no I haven't thought of anything yet

540
00:36:24,662 --> 00:36:27,245
Why should you think? I
have bottled up my thoughts

541
00:36:28,006 --> 00:36:31,339
He's already asking for the next set I think
he is stuck and unable to move forward

542
00:36:31,945 --> 00:36:36,029
Vairamuthu sir. There's this girl I know

543
00:36:36,586 --> 00:36:37,961
Her name is Saroja

544
00:36:38,252 --> 00:36:41,382
Very close
She wants to become a singer

545
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:42,345
When will I become a poet?

546
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:49,370
Vairamuthu sir, you know several
legends who are music directors

547
00:36:50,604 --> 00:36:54,104
If you can help

548
00:36:54,872 --> 00:36:56,913
- It's a matter of life
- You are pleading too much

549
00:36:57,249 --> 00:37:00,124

553
00:37:11,203 --> 00:37:14,328
Dreams, anyone can have dreams

554
00:37:14,557 --> 00:37:17,932
If I can get a chance

555
00:37:18,287 --> 00:37:21,120
Not because I am Poochi's friend

556
00:37:24,828 --> 00:37:26,223
For my talent if you can

557
00:37:26,248 --> 00:37:29,066
Captain calling. Over

tell about me to Rehman Sir

563
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:50,029
My dear Saroja

I will do anything for Poochi, Because
friendship is the salt of life

565
00:37:56,483 --> 00:37:58,483
Give the phone to Poochi

566
00:37:58,849 --> 00:38:02,057
Vairamuthu sir has a bit of Shivaji voice

567
00:38:03,928 --> 00:38:07,470
Vairamuthu sir, did you hear her, you
are speaking in Shivaji actor's voice

568
00:38:07,495 --> 00:38:09,995
Will trash you with slippers

569
00:38:11,104 --> 00:38:13,937
I will hang up now
Will send it out soon

570
00:38:16,035 --> 00:38:18,035
I just can't believe it

571
00:38:21,068 --> 00:38:23,359
Even I can't believe it

572
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:26,192
I need to give soup to madam. Let me
give her soup and be back in 10 minutes

573
00:38:26,216 --> 00:38:28,092
Should I sing a classical
song or westerner But Rehman

574
00:38:28,116 --> 00:38:30,366
sir prefers Hindustani
music, let me sing that

575
00:38:40,291 --> 00:38:42,732
This place is fine with you?
It's okay

576
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:45,088
Sing

577
00:39:03,037 --> 00:39:04,037
Stop!

578
00:39:04,716 --> 00:39:07,632
You can hear what you are singing
- I can hear it well

579
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:08,998
You can't?

580
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:12,055
Some hearing problem?
- Not yet

581
00:39:12,102 --> 00:39:16,226
Hey! You are going to fool me saying that
I got deceived that you are a singer

582
00:39:16,578 --> 00:39:18,232
Why are you teasing me?

583
00:39:18,257 --> 00:39:20,132
I promise you that I am
one of the best singers

584
00:39:20,412 --> 00:39:21,745
You promise that you are a singer

585
00:39:21,855 --> 00:39:25,772
No your voice was slightly
not in tune and a bit rusty

586
00:39:26,245 --> 00:39:28,373
That's because of change
if water in several

587
00:39:28,398 --> 00:39:30,773
shooting locations So the
voice is slightly damaged

588
00:39:30,983 --> 00:39:31,983
Slightly

589
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:36,828
In school everyone appreciated that
my voice was like singer Chitra

590
00:39:37,283 --> 00:39:39,178
I have even won prizes

591
00:39:39,288 --> 00:39:42,663
My mother also compliments that my voice is
like another eminent singer Shreya Ghosal

592
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:44,203
Only today it's like this

593
00:39:44,944 --> 00:39:48,903
So it's because of your sore throat
that your voice is like this

594
00:39:49,078 --> 00:39:50,803
- Promise
- I believe you

595
00:39:50,828 --> 00:39:54,787
We need to send it to Vairamuthu sir
by tomorrow You'll get down by 2

596
00:39:55,412 --> 00:39:58,662
How can we tune the voice by then?

597
00:39:58,828 --> 00:40:01,596
Can you give me a bit of palm sugar and
pepper with milk to heal my throat?

598
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:03,120
Why a bit? You can have plenty

599
00:40:03,245 --> 00:40:06,453
If I drink that my voice will
be clear, then I can sing

600
00:40:06,845 --> 00:40:09,131
Which Rehman sir will like, hearing
that he will give me a chance

601
00:40:09,155 --> 00:40:11,155
Then I will become a famous singer

602
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:15,380
Coming year every nook &
corner will echo your song

603
00:40:15,971 --> 00:40:18,554
Everyone will die hearing your voice

604
00:40:19,124 --> 00:40:21,124
It will definitely happen

605
00:40:22,745 --> 00:40:24,953
I've been here for long,
Maam will search

606
00:40:25,648 --> 00:40:26,683
Don't forget the milk

607
00:40:26,709 --> 00:40:29,459
You don't worry, I'll come
with the milk during the lunch

608
00:40:30,307 --> 00:40:32,557
- with palm sugar and pepper
- Sure

609
00:40:33,955 --> 00:40:35,575
I'll surely become a singer, right?

610
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,266
You will surely become a singer

611
00:40:37,789 --> 00:40:41,039
You are a mix of Chitra and shreya goshal

612
00:40:41,464 --> 00:40:43,464
Your name is Chitra Goshal!

613
00:40:43,922 --> 00:40:44,922
Chitra Goshal!

614
00:40:45,383 --> 00:40:50,647
Every nook and corner echoes my song

615
00:40:50,672 --> 00:40:55,338
Every nightingale nods it's head to my song

616
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:27,948
Will flutter with joy to
the melody of this song

617
00:41:28,518 --> 00:41:32,976
The drums of celebration will fill the air

618
00:41:45,019 --> 00:41:49,394
They will create a stamp
with my beautiful face

619
00:41:50,398 --> 00:41:55,482
My income tax will wipe out
the debts of this nation

620
00:42:09,717 --> 00:42:14,383
Everybody all around
Listens to my song

621
00:42:15,393 --> 00:42:19,185
Birds in the trees whistle it along

622
00:42:20,693 --> 00:42:22,693
Passing winds blow around

623
00:42:23,568 --> 00:42:25,443
To my beat flowers are bound

624
00:42:53,511 --> 00:42:59,356
Train no 11015 DC express
is arriving at platform no

625
00:42:59,447 --> 00:43:01,863

Are you mad!
Give way

631
00:43:32,368 --> 00:43:35,202
I simply hold the post of a central
minister, It's of no value

632
00:43:35,993 --> 00:43:37,993
Thinking of resigning

633
00:43:38,094 --> 00:43:39,386
I'm okay if you are okay with it

634
00:43:40,105 --> 00:43:43,313

00:44:06,038 --> 00:44:07,584
You asked me to be loud

642
00:44:07,609 --> 00:44:09,842
This is a high security
area, don't come here

643
00:44:10,256 --> 00:44:11,179

- Have it and take some rest
- Then will you see my duty

652
00:44:42,295 --> 00:44:44,295
When can I take the medicine

653
00:44:44,499 --> 00:44:46,790
If you don't take it in
time it's a problem for you

654
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:49,688
Don't keep repeating it like a fool

- Excuse me, may I come in?
- You have already come in

659
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:10,060
Sir, good morning sir

660
00:45:10,575 --> 00:45:12,033
I'm Pantry manager Chandrakanth

661
00:45:12,659 --> 00:45:14,617
- I'm not only manager
- Ex Military

662
00:45:15,874 --> 00:45:18,080
The best pantry in Indian railways is ours

663
00:45:18,285 --> 00:45:21,118
And the reason is me is what everyone says

664
00:45:21,711 --> 00:45:22,711
Few of them

665
00:45:23,272 --> 00:45:26,314
I'll attend all the VVIP'S sir

666
00:45:26,339 --> 00:45:28,714
Because we can't believe these vendors

667
00:45:31,063 --> 00:45:32,063
Nice sir!

668
00:45:32,906 --> 00:45:34,448
I didn't order cold coffee

669
00:45:35,049 --> 00:45:36,049
Sir, coffee

670
00:45:39,192 --> 00:45:41,080

671
00:45:41,164 --> 00:45:43,372
Sir, my assistant

00:45:43,537 --> 00:45:46,453

673
00:45:47,264 --> 00:45:49,264
But not you, send that boy

- Shut and leave

675
00:45:53,352 --> 00:45:54,352

00:45:56,015 --> 00:45:57,015
Thanks sir

677
00:45:58,902 --> 00:45:59,902
Go!

678
00:46:02,706 --> 00:46:04,706
Saw

679
00:46:05,428 --> 00:46:06,428
I didn't me that

680
00:46:07,226 --> 00:46:09,517
He's a true gentleman,
he didn't want to bother

681
00:46:09,542 --> 00:46:11,542
another senior like
me, so he sent me out

682
00:46:12,135 --> 00:46:14,135
You should broad, open and wide

683
00:46:14,332 --> 00:46:16,748
The growing generation
should learn all this

684
00:46:17,406 --> 00:46:21,990
Don't rejoice that he
called you instead of me-

685
00:46:22,734 --> 00:46:24,254
How else can I handle such situations?

686
00:46:25,933 --> 00:46:28,766
Srisha!
It's correct time to connect

687
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:33,063
Saroja, apply this on my legs

688
00:46:34,813 --> 00:46:36,605
Is that Srisha's legs

689
00:46:39,456 --> 00:46:42,459
- Who are you?
- I'm the DTR, sorry Pantry manager

690
00:46:42,484 --> 00:46:44,026
Aunty, I didn't come for you

691
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:47,250
Who did you come searching for?

692
00:46:50,029 --> 00:46:52,075
Stupid fellow. Are you senseless?

693
00:46:52,115 --> 00:46:54,747
Is this the way to behave with an artist

694
00:46:54,772 --> 00:46:55,772
Just shut up and get lost

695
00:46:56,016 --> 00:46:57,850
What are you waiting for?

696
00:46:58,070 --> 00:46:59,070
Go bring the DTR

697
00:46:59,095 --> 00:47:00,889
Instead you can hit me with the slipper

698
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:02,688
I will complain about you

699
00:47:02,938 --> 00:47:05,886
Madam, he's not so prominent that you
should give a complaint against him

700
00:47:05,911 --> 00:47:06,805
He's old

701
00:47:06,830 --> 00:47:09,288
Is this how an old man behaves?

702
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:10,943
He's a crazy man

703
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:14,193
Do you want to get out
of this place or not?

704
00:47:14,986 --> 00:47:15,986
Call the DTR

705
00:47:16,011 --> 00:47:17,344
You please excuse him for my sake

706
00:47:17,834 --> 00:47:19,080
For your sake I will pardon him

707
00:47:19,105 --> 00:47:21,105
Please ask sorry

708
00:47:22,063 --> 00:47:23,063
Madam sorry

709
00:47:25,693 --> 00:47:28,652
When I spit at you,
You come up, with a thank you

710
00:47:32,969 --> 00:47:34,469
Why did you open it?

711
00:47:34,847 --> 00:47:37,472
Sir you told me what ever I do, I
should be wide and open about it

712
00:47:37,497 --> 00:47:39,205
I meant the heart and words

713
00:47:39,292 --> 00:47:41,750
In your eyes I saw the
burning sexual desire

714
00:47:42,765 --> 00:47:46,182
Sexual desire?
My serene look appeared like sexual desire

715
00:47:46,979 --> 00:47:50,187
None should know what happened here

716
00:48:03,287 --> 00:48:04,287
You are here

717
00:48:05,472 --> 00:48:07,347
Are you a Malayali?
- Yes

718
00:48:07,846 --> 00:48:09,304
Yes where are you from?
Sheranur

719
00:48:09,329 --> 00:48:11,538
I am Trivandrum
- Who are you with?

720
00:48:11,649 --> 00:48:14,264
This actress Srisha,
I am her assistant

721
00:48:14,289 --> 00:48:16,364
Would you like to take
a picture with her?

722
00:48:16,389 --> 00:48:17,472
No

723
00:48:17,497 --> 00:48:19,663
What's your name?
- Chitra Ghosal

724
00:48:20,276 --> 00:48:22,710
Even I want you to
be Chitra Ghosal

725
00:48:22,735 --> 00:48:25,569
If you keep mindlessly chattering
like this your voice will turn sore

726
00:48:25,943 --> 00:48:29,109
Just spoke to Vairamuthu
sir, he has told Rehman sir

727
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,705
Milk is ready, get ready

728
00:48:31,730 --> 00:48:33,313
I will give food to Mom and come

729
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:36,788
What are you? - You want
vegetarian or non-vegetarian meals

730
00:48:36,813 --> 00:48:39,574
- Understand( in Malayalam)
- Samosa will be available after 4 o clock

731
00:48:39,636 --> 00:48:41,303
You can't get it now!

732
00:48:41,914 --> 00:48:42,914
Good afternoon Sir

733
00:48:43,288 --> 00:48:45,288
If no one respects him

734
00:48:45,313 --> 00:48:47,063
Has he cut it!
Don't call again

735
00:48:48,011 --> 00:48:50,178
They have decided not to
listen to anything that we say

736
00:48:50,519 --> 00:48:52,936
If we ask further they will it's
being handled in the Capital

737
00:48:53,581 --> 00:48:55,039
Why the hell..

738
00:48:56,029 --> 00:48:58,154
Please stay outside for sometime

739
00:49:04,166 --> 00:49:06,004
Politics should be like this boy

740
00:49:06,029 --> 00:49:08,445
When there was a small stain
he immediately cleaned it

741
00:49:09,033 --> 00:49:09,945
Look at you all

742
00:49:09,970 --> 00:49:11,850
You think you can easily
lure a girl from Kerala

743
00:49:12,062 --> 00:49:14,478
Why are you splitting people as
those from Kerala, Tamil Nadu

744
00:49:14,738 --> 00:49:16,504
We are all brothers and sisters

745
00:49:16,864 --> 00:49:18,864
So she's your sister
- Her mother is my sister

746
00:49:19,105 --> 00:49:20,455
Is she your fiancé

747
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,063
If she comes I can make her happy

748
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,834
I said Tamil Nadu is a state that has always
welcomed people and made them prosperous

749
00:49:24,858 --> 00:49:27,450
She in D coupe it's actress
Srisha She's from Kerala,

750
00:49:27,475 --> 00:49:29,323
but we have given her stardom
and made her successful

751
00:49:29,347 --> 00:49:31,223
Why from yesteryear actress
Revathy to most recent Lakshmi

752
00:49:31,247 --> 00:49:33,287
Menon we have given them a
chance and made them stars

753
00:49:33,311 --> 00:49:34,956
Like this there are several
opportunities several

754
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:36,813
lives We just introduce
them and keep moving

755
00:49:37,038 --> 00:49:39,830
Our people have talent
Your people don't have it

756
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:42,019
That's why you plead with us and take them

757
00:49:42,152 --> 00:49:44,830
Don't say that sir
Our girls are born artist

758
00:49:45,073 --> 00:49:47,781
Ask our boys they will tell
you how well they can act

759
00:49:47,998 --> 00:49:51,205
It's just that they are
not interested in cinema

760
00:49:51,285 --> 00:49:52,910
Otherwise we are also stars

761
00:49:53,592 --> 00:49:55,342
Your minister is an
eminent person isn't it?

762
00:49:55,398 --> 00:49:59,857
For his protection the chief commander
is Mr Nanadakumar, a Malayali

763
00:50:00,191 --> 00:50:01,608
We are also big

764
00:50:02,186 --> 00:50:03,603
Have you seen the movie Thalapathi?

765
00:50:03,753 --> 00:50:07,238
For megastar Mamooty it's superstar
Rajnikanth who protects him

766
00:50:07,263 --> 00:50:09,666
Hey! Rajnikanth is from our Maharashtra
- If you

767
00:50:09,691 --> 00:50:12,149
talk like this in Tamil
Nadu you will be trashed

768
00:50:12,747 --> 00:50:15,372
It's fine, put this aside,
all Indians are eminent

769
00:50:15,607 --> 00:50:16,607
Let's be friends

770
00:50:17,465 --> 00:50:20,730
Evening I will send out extra cutlets
I will take a selfie with this gun

771
00:50:23,813 --> 00:50:24,813
What's this?

772
00:50:25,492 --> 00:50:27,367
I just touched it
- Touched it?

773
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,848
For you to touch and see
is this your garbage can?

774
00:50:30,022 --> 00:50:33,397
This is my job
Disrespectful idiot

775
00:50:33,647 --> 00:50:39,063
For this I became a SI, became a
commando and attending training and camps

776
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:42,412
- Sir!
- Bloody dog!

777
00:50:42,818 --> 00:50:44,526
You and your face

778
00:50:44,859 --> 00:50:46,568
Your face and appearance annoys me

779
00:50:48,158 --> 00:50:49,950
- I just don't like you
- Why? - Is there a

780
00:50:49,975 --> 00:50:51,850
reason why the snake
dislikes the porcupine?

781
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:55,625
Similarly, I just don't like
you You are like a garbage

782
00:50:55,883 --> 00:50:58,592
Waste Human waste

783
00:50:59,242 --> 00:51:02,034
Sir. No need It hurts

784
00:51:02,495 --> 00:51:04,495
I am just a deprived person
making a living here

785
00:51:04,862 --> 00:51:07,580
What have I done to you?
If I have erred excuse me

786
00:51:07,706 --> 00:51:10,236
It angers me
Looking at your face angers me

787
00:51:10,261 --> 00:51:13,969
Don't come this side for service
Ask your manager to come

788
00:51:16,844 --> 00:51:18,303
Can you serve this soup?

789
00:51:18,781 --> 00:51:20,114
No sir they told me not to do it?

790
00:51:20,139 --> 00:51:22,779
From the Capital, they have told you
not to serve me even some soup

791
00:51:22,917 --> 00:51:23,917
Who told you?

792
00:51:24,397 --> 00:51:27,357
Sir told me not serve you and that the
pantry manager should only serve you

793
00:51:27,591 --> 00:51:29,092
Who is that Sir?
- He's standing outside

794
00:51:29,116 --> 00:51:30,116
Call that sir

795
00:51:31,725 --> 00:51:32,750
Sir is calling you

796
00:51:34,819 --> 00:51:39,050
You come and sit here, I will hold
this in my hand and stand outside

797
00:51:39,433 --> 00:51:42,308
Can't I even say who should serve me soup?

798
00:51:42,542 --> 00:51:45,348
I have told that the pantry manager should
not come here and only this boy should come

799
00:51:45,372 --> 00:51:47,747
You are instructing the other way

800
00:51:48,014 --> 00:51:50,955
You have some plans to
poison my food and kill me

801
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:52,813
Isn't it suspicious?
- Yes sir

802
00:51:53,168 --> 00:51:56,585
You don't have to worry sir
I have tasted it before sending it to you

803
00:51:56,883 --> 00:51:59,217
You want me to eat the remain
of what you have eaten?

804
00:51:59,622 --> 00:52:00,623
Is it the arrogance of a Malayali?

805
00:52:00,647 --> 00:52:03,727
I didn't mean it Sir, - The minister gets
to eat meat and different delicacies

806
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:06,205
You have decided to have a scrumptious meal

807
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:09,092
I didn't say it from that angle
- Then say it from this angle

808
00:52:09,398 --> 00:52:10,731
Say something

809
00:52:10,756 --> 00:52:14,089
Your face disgust me
It annoys me

810
00:52:14,752 --> 00:52:17,877
Where do they pick them from?
He looks like an accused

811
00:52:18,198 --> 00:52:19,198
Get out

812
00:52:20,062 --> 00:52:22,562
Don't stare at that boy Leave

813
00:52:25,303 --> 00:52:27,303
Of late even the watchman
does not respect us

814
00:52:30,573 --> 00:52:32,823
Please give us 10 minutes

815
00:52:36,045 --> 00:52:37,336
Are you trying to frame me?

816
00:52:38,027 --> 00:52:39,027
No sir

817
00:52:39,188 --> 00:52:43,563
Words are like seeds, If we sow good
ones we reap good, If we sow evil we will

818
00:52:44,678 --> 00:52:46,678
But I didn't expect you to reap it so soon

819
00:52:48,553 --> 00:52:49,553
I am ready

820
00:52:49,804 --> 00:52:52,929
Sir, if we like everyone
Everyone will like us

821
00:52:53,362 --> 00:52:55,029
Come lets go See, they like it

822
00:52:55,226 --> 00:52:57,268
Why waste time here

823
00:53:04,036 --> 00:53:06,786
Hey during training time
in our batch 2 people

824
00:53:06,811 --> 00:53:09,477
went missing Actually
they didn't go missing

825
00:53:18,019 --> 00:53:20,019
What did he say?
- I didn't understand

826
00:53:20,195 --> 00:53:22,945
- Let's close the door -You want
another cup of milk -No need

827
00:53:24,430 --> 00:53:26,430
- My throat has cleared up now
Now hear me

828
00:53:35,617 --> 00:53:37,659
What's that noise?
Hiccups

829
00:53:37,913 --> 00:53:39,153
- For you?
- No for that old man

830
00:53:41,049 --> 00:53:41,663
It stopped...

831
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:43,553
- It's coming up well
- Of course

832
00:53:46,153 --> 00:53:48,194
Hey! There are several old
people here

833
00:53:48,219 --> 00:53:50,636
Let's not send everyone together,
let's do it one at a time

834
00:53:51,002 --> 00:53:54,044
Sir, No 10 calling You want me to come
there immediately. Urgent? I am coming

835
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:57,655
Oh no! We need to record it and send it via
what's app, My voice is at its best now

Will leave now

840
00:54:09,409 --> 00:54:12,367
That rotten guy will talk like that
Why are you getting upset

841
00:54:13,621 --> 00:54:17,330
I was working sincerely
I don't even how to use this device

842
00:54:17,472 --> 00:54:20,038
Because I didn't answer this
, he verbally abused me

843
00:54:20,312 --> 00:54:22,521
I don't even know how to use this device

844
00:54:22,844 --> 00:54:26,594
He made derogatory comments
even against my parents

845
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:29,943
He asked to quit the job and leave

846
00:54:30,163 --> 00:54:33,288
Don't cry
- Of late he's going overboard

847
00:54:33,531 --> 00:54:37,240
Let's make him go mad

848
00:54:38,538 --> 00:54:40,538
Give the correct change
- That's it

849
00:54:40,726 --> 00:54:42,018
No 10 calling Sir

850
00:54:42,438 --> 00:54:44,938
Tell me
- In H A1 Minister wants a Veg Salad

851
00:54:45,591 --> 00:54:48,716
In A2 and A3 passengers are complaining
that the service is not good

852
00:54:49,128 --> 00:54:52,128
Not just A2 and A3,from every
compartment I have received complaints

853
00:54:52,614 --> 00:54:54,572
None of the sales boys are
going around If I spot

854
00:54:54,597 --> 00:54:56,437
any of you, I will
definitely hack you to death

855
00:54:56,847 --> 00:54:59,663
Then there's a link between
you and that murder case

856
00:54:59,824 --> 00:55:01,330
What murder case?
Who is this?

857
00:55:01,355 --> 00:55:04,230
Who was involved in that case
this is DSP Dheenadhalayan

858
00:55:05,104 --> 00:55:10,009
DSP Dheendhalayan
This is pantry manager Chandrakanth

859
00:55:10,241 --> 00:55:12,933
You can be a pantry moron but why did
you get involved in the murder case

860
00:55:12,957 --> 00:55:14,290
Murder?

861
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:18,105

immediately arrest him

862
00:55:18,639 --> 00:55:21,184

I let him go as it
happened in a train

952
00:59:43,646 --> 00:59:45,771
Don't get in trouble for a girl

953
00:59:45,985 --> 00:59:47,360
After Thada you both are strangers

954
00:59:47,527 --> 00:59:48,235

964
01:00:26,586 --> 01:00:27,836
I too can't take this anymore

965
01:00:28,121 --> 01:00:29,163
I'm gonna bash you

- How?
- No one understands our talent

968
01:00:35,902 --> 01:00:37,735
Firstly, Do you know it?

969
01:00:37,985 --> 01:00:40,569
Not knowing your status
Why the hell do you fall in love?

970
01:00:41,045 --> 01:00:42,086
He is talking about status

971
01:00:44,485 --> 01:00:48,235
- For this sad mood I
can recite a poem - Shut up!

972
01:00:48,444 --> 01:00:50,881
- Why is your voice down,
are you emotional?

973
01:00:50,906 --> 01:00:51,906
Emotions?

974
01:00:52,485 --> 01:00:56,069
Been running around with this train
for the past 35 years

975
01:00:56,694 --> 01:00:59,694
That's why, but hereafter I
can be along with you all

976
01:01:00,610 --> 01:01:03,235
- Daddy, have you started?
- Dear, are you not asleep yet?

977
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:04,945
- How did the function go?
- What?

978
01:01:05,235 --> 01:01:08,235
You want me to work, my money,
But not my mother

979
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:11,397
- Can we live peacefully with your mother?
- Then go back to your mother

980
01:01:11,646 --> 01:01:13,479
Why should I go?

981
01:01:13,867 --> 01:01:15,867
You won't go there, or tolerate it here

982
01:01:16,149 --> 01:01:18,649
You are like a serpent around my neck

983
01:01:18,674 --> 01:01:20,027
If you don't decide I'll die

984
01:01:20,235 --> 01:01:21,319

Daddy, did you take
your medication?

988
01:01:41,952 --> 01:01:42,752
I forgot it

989
01:01:42,794 --> 01:01:45,752
- It's already late, you have...
- Don't scold me,

990
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:48,217

991
01:01:48,914 --> 01:01:51,956

If you disrespect others love,
your love will be devastated

998
01:02:46,506 --> 01:02:47,922
- Were you in love?
- Then?

999
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:49,654

Srisha is not the girl for me

1006
01:03:07,203 --> 01:03:09,953

Then bring a rope

1018
01:03:34,944 --> 01:03:36,860
He was calm when I
tried for Srisha

1019
01:03:37,224 --> 01:03:40,085
Why is he furious when I
am trying for her mother

signaling attention What's with you?

1035
01:04:50,752 --> 01:04:52,877
Better tell your mother,
She is talking too much

1036
01:04:52,902 --> 01:04:54,152
What have you decided?

1037
01:04:54,919 --> 01:04:56,919
You are acting weird today?

1038
01:04:57,003 --> 01:04:58,294
Sorry sir, Family problem

1039
01:04:58,334 --> 01:05:01,542
Family? There are many
families traveling trusting us

1040
01:05:01,789 --> 01:05:04,748
Don't you know to switch off
your phone when in duty?

1041
01:05:05,649 --> 01:05:07,316
- Sorry, I'll switch it off
- I will

1042
01:05:20,652 --> 01:05:21,652
Does it hurt?

1043
01:05:41,053 --> 01:05:43,053
Oh no!
Please!

1044
01:05:44,819 --> 01:05:45,819
What?

1045
01:05:46,235 --> 01:05:48,569
Madam wanted to know
what can we served hot?

1046
01:05:48,652 --> 01:05:51,110
Hot? I'm the only one hot
Ask if she would take me?

1047
01:05:52,725 --> 01:05:54,350
- Where are you going?
- To ask

1048
01:05:54,375 --> 01:05:55,375
His training...

1049
01:05:56,039 --> 01:05:57,999
- Where is Poochi(In Malayalam)
- Insect fritters?

1050
01:05:58,100 --> 01:06:01,225
Come by 10 AM, I'll gather the
fritters with dead insects on it

1051
01:06:02,264 --> 01:06:04,264
Is she Chinese

1052
01:06:04,444 --> 01:06:05,860
- Poochiyappan
- Poochi

1053
01:06:08,021 --> 01:06:09,021
He's there

1054
01:06:11,194 --> 01:06:12,819
Don't tell I'm here

1055
01:06:15,569 --> 01:06:16,902
Is her mom...

1056
01:06:18,553 --> 01:06:19,761
No, you leave!

1057
01:06:20,456 --> 01:06:21,914
Don't go tell this to him

1058
01:06:22,777 --> 01:06:25,152
I can't keep my mouth shut

1059
01:06:25,668 --> 01:06:26,835
- Sir!
- What?

1060
01:06:26,919 --> 01:06:27,919
What did the girl ask?

1061
01:06:27,961 --> 01:06:29,794
She asked when I'm
going to kill you all

1062
01:06:29,936 --> 01:06:30,936
What did you say?

1063
01:06:30,961 --> 01:06:34,503
I said I was planning eliminate
you all with this train?

1064
01:06:34,670 --> 01:06:36,753
Poochi, he is here

1065
01:06:38,787 --> 01:06:40,787
You are so scared!

1066
01:06:42,569 --> 01:06:43,569
Fear

1067
01:06:45,194 --> 01:06:46,194
I'll finish you

1068
01:06:48,669 --> 01:06:50,420
What are you doing here at this time?
Not sleeping

1069
01:06:50,444 --> 01:06:51,402
I can't sleep

1070
01:06:51,444 --> 01:06:53,819
- Are you scared of what he said?
- Not that

1071
01:06:54,477 --> 01:06:55,477
Then?

1072
01:06:55,502 --> 01:06:57,627
- To sing?
- No

1073
01:06:57,652 --> 01:06:59,652
I wanted to see you, that why

1074
01:07:03,717 --> 01:07:05,467
I'm very happy

1075
01:07:06,110 --> 01:07:07,110
Now, I'll leave

1076
01:07:09,167 --> 01:07:11,959
You said you are happy
Why sing already?

1077
01:07:12,225 --> 01:07:13,933
I can sing only when
I get to the mood

1078
01:07:14,511 --> 01:07:16,386
- Mood!!
- To sing

1079
01:07:18,308 --> 01:07:21,058
- What?
- There are few elderly people here

1080
01:07:21,110 --> 01:07:21,777
So?

1081
01:07:21,802 --> 01:07:23,760
They might be asleep,
we might disturb them

1082
01:07:24,316 --> 01:07:27,307
We would have to go to
the train roof then

1083
01:07:27,654 --> 01:07:29,195
Super idea!

1084
01:07:29,527 --> 01:07:31,735
It is better for us to
go up before others do

1085
01:07:32,652 --> 01:07:34,735
Let's go up
- are you joking?

1086
01:07:35,128 --> 01:07:37,815
How can we get to the roof of a
running train? - Won't you believe me

1087
01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:40,756
Is it without trust that I'm
sitting next to you at this hour

1088
01:07:41,068 --> 01:07:42,068
Then get up

1089
01:07:49,944 --> 01:07:50,944
I'll kill you

1090
01:08:23,913 --> 01:08:26,454
Nandakumar, What happened?

1091
01:08:29,277 --> 01:08:31,444
Did you take your medication?

1092
01:08:44,209 --> 01:08:45,209
I'll kill you!

1093
01:08:54,834 --> 01:08:56,834
Poochi, let's leave

1094
01:08:57,735 --> 01:08:58,735
No!

1095
01:08:59,266 --> 01:09:01,600
Let's leave!

1096
01:09:02,341 --> 01:09:04,007
No need poochi

1097
01:09:05,761 --> 01:09:07,761
- How much is you Tea can?
- Tea can?

1098
01:09:08,141 --> 01:09:10,257
It would be 800 to 900 rupees

1099
01:09:10,694 --> 01:09:11,694
Give it!

1100
01:09:12,842 --> 01:09:14,258
Then why did you give

1101
01:09:14,860 --> 01:09:16,860
Don't play, my...

1102
01:09:17,196 --> 01:09:18,530
Give back my gun

1103
01:09:18,555 --> 01:09:20,555
Gun!
That's your Job, right?

1104
01:09:20,652 --> 01:09:21,652
It's gone

1105
01:09:22,277 --> 01:09:24,002
Don't act, It might get me in trouble

1106
01:09:24,027 --> 01:09:25,402
It's fully loaded

1107
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:28,714
Loaded means it is filled with bullets

1108
01:09:29,149 --> 01:09:31,652
If anyone uses it to kill some one
You are in trouble, right?

1109
01:09:32,217 --> 01:09:34,092
Poochi, please give back the gun

1110
01:09:35,069 --> 01:09:39,235
If you cannot what's your job, then
why the hell are you in this job

1111
01:09:40,169 --> 01:09:44,072
If they ask such questions to me for loosing
the tea can, then what will be your state

1112
01:09:44,097 --> 01:09:45,680
- Give it!
- What did you say then?

1113
01:09:46,137 --> 01:09:47,177
You would shoot both of us

1114
01:09:47,569 --> 01:09:49,235
What did he say?

1115
01:09:49,584 --> 01:09:51,584
I'll kill you

1116
01:09:55,610 --> 01:09:56,694
You hit my girl

1117
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,902
- I was wrong then, give it back
- Apologize

1118
01:10:03,092 --> 01:10:05,717
- Sorry sir
- To the madam

1119
01:10:07,586 --> 01:10:09,586

What are you doing?

1124
01:10:23,985 --> 01:10:25,652
Asking sorry as you said

1125
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:26,860
Did you see how he asked?

1126
01:10:26,944 --> 01:10:28,944
I can't tolerate seeing this guys face

1127
01:10:29,210 --> 01:10:30,294
You too don't like him

1128
01:10:30,319 --> 01:10:32,235
No one seems to like you

1129
01:10:32,547 --> 01:10:34,422
Shall we not give back the gun

1130
01:10:35,035 --> 01:10:38,160

1131
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:39,360
Who knows?

1132
01:10:41,944 --> 01:10:43,444
We both are Malayalees

1133
01:10:43,897 --> 01:10:47,397
Please help me out with
him being a malayalee

1134
01:10:48,785 --> 01:10:51,118
There is only Good and bad in humans

1135
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:53,027
There is no Malayalee, Tamils

1136
01:10:53,052 --> 01:10:54,844
You are a bad guy

1137
01:10:56,152 --> 01:10:57,485
Poochi lets leave

1138
01:10:58,277 --> 01:11:00,485
- I understood the part
where you said good man,

1139
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:01,973
what's the other

1140
01:11:01,998 --> 01:11:05,539
It means someone who lies, cheats,

1141
01:11:05,819 --> 01:11:07,819
in brief a fraud

1142
01:11:10,110 --> 01:11:11,902
Please give back the gun
I beg you

1143
01:11:12,607 --> 01:11:13,607

I'll give it
Come get it after an hour

1145
01:11:16,694 --> 01:11:20,717
I'll give it once my girl gets down at Thada,

1146
01:11:21,061 --> 01:11:23,019
Poochi!
Please!

1147
01:11:23,446 --> 01:11:25,321
Hey we are telling you,
don't you understand?

1148
01:11:26,155 --> 01:11:28,113
Please give me the gun

1149
01:11:28,649 --> 01:11:30,858
Don't trouble us
We are going up for recording

1150
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:32,905
If someone comes
come up and tell us

1151
01:11:32,946 --> 01:11:34,238
Poochi if Mother comes?

1152
01:11:34,405 --> 01:11:37,988
What if she comes?
Just say madam has gone to the pantry

1153
01:11:38,821 --> 01:11:40,821
It will look like you are a pimp

1154
01:11:40,988 --> 01:11:43,147
But don't interpret it that way

1155
01:11:43,172 --> 01:11:46,964
- What about the dog?
- He's free. You can give it to him

1156
01:11:48,857 --> 01:11:52,023
Watch it with great caution.
Not like your gun What?

1157
01:11:52,527 --> 01:11:56,235
Not tamed yet?
Wait and watch

1158
01:12:12,133 --> 01:12:15,508
Before I become a singer
I think you will kill me

1159
01:12:16,071 --> 01:12:17,946
If you become a singer
you will kill everyone

1160
01:12:18,308 --> 01:12:19,308
Nothing come

1161
01:12:21,071 --> 01:12:24,196
- Ponchi hold my hand
- Don't be scared. Give me your hand

1162
01:12:42,155 --> 01:12:44,988
You are starting with such a high pitch

1163
01:12:46,008 --> 01:12:47,717
My friend sang in such a pitch

1164
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:50,421
We all pitched in arranged his funeral

1165
01:12:50,446 --> 01:12:52,446
- Don't tease
- You sing

1166
01:12:56,818 --> 01:13:00,026
Who said love is blind? The truth is
Love is deaf

1167
01:13:30,615 --> 01:13:33,531
What's this? Where did you go? Why
are you coming down from there?

1168
01:13:34,069 --> 01:13:36,777
No with Poochi

1169
01:13:37,016 --> 01:13:38,696
Romancing him?

1170
01:13:39,141 --> 01:13:42,391
Hey Poochi Is this why you were
hanging around this place?

1171
01:13:42,995 --> 01:13:46,703
You will poison the morning tea,
What were you doing up?

1172
01:13:47,121 --> 01:13:49,329
I wanted to sing and show him

1173
01:13:50,552 --> 01:13:53,196
Did you show him everything?

1174
01:13:54,293 --> 01:13:56,695
I just wanted to sing and record it

1175
01:13:57,860 --> 01:13:59,402
Recording?

1176
01:13:59,667 --> 01:14:01,584
I wanted to be a singer

1177
01:14:02,238 --> 01:14:06,405
You think you will be a
legendary singer like S Janaki

1178
01:14:09,905 --> 01:14:11,905
Call the security

1179
01:14:12,826 --> 01:14:16,284
Won't you caution that cows
are there on the left side

1180
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:19,310
You will, only watch the right side.
Won't you look towards the left?

1181
01:14:19,546 --> 01:14:22,288
We both travel on the same engine
You are blaming me for your accident

1182
01:14:22,312 --> 01:14:23,312
Are you intoxicated?

1183
01:14:23,477 --> 01:14:25,518
During work you are drunk
Not working properly,

1184
01:14:25,543 --> 01:14:27,376
not exercising caution
and no proper signal

1185
01:14:28,118 --> 01:14:30,361
- Irresponsible idiot
- Talk with respect

1186
01:14:30,386 --> 01:14:31,386
He's here

1187
01:14:32,655 --> 01:14:33,655
Sir you called?

1188
01:14:47,071 --> 01:14:49,580
Thank you Sir

1189
01:14:49,988 --> 01:14:54,696
You are sleeping unaware of what's happening
around. How will you safeguard my life?

1190
01:14:55,175 --> 01:14:57,425
- Hey! Why are you hitting a girl?
- You keep quite

1191
01:14:57,628 --> 01:15:00,128
Saying he will take you to
Vairamuthu, what did he do to you?

1192
01:15:00,207 --> 01:15:02,874
What did you do to her?
She's an innocent girl

1193
01:15:03,586 --> 01:15:06,045
He lied that he knows Vairamuthu
- It's not a lie

1194
01:15:06,696 --> 01:15:09,280
It's true
I spoke to him over the phone

1195
01:15:09,375 --> 01:15:11,625
Spoke to him?
Alright then I will also talk to him

1196
01:15:12,071 --> 01:15:14,738
Then you call now

1197
01:15:14,812 --> 01:15:17,896
Why are you hesitant Poochi. Call now

1198
01:15:19,030 --> 01:15:21,921
I spoke to him in the night. After
the recording he must be resting

1199
01:15:21,946 --> 01:15:25,030
It's alright
We will apologise to him

1200
01:15:25,136 --> 01:15:27,886
Only if they talk to him, will these
insensitive people understand

1201
01:15:28,469 --> 01:15:31,178
Dial his number Call him

1202
01:15:34,444 --> 01:15:35,444
What happened?

1203
01:15:36,683 --> 01:15:38,683
Leave!

1204
01:15:43,385 --> 01:15:45,385
What's the problem?

1205
01:15:49,405 --> 01:15:50,988
Hello Vairamuthu sir

1206
01:15:51,792 --> 01:15:54,375
This is Poochi
- This is Vairamuthu

1207
01:15:54,946 --> 01:15:57,571
I understand that you are with that girl

1208
01:15:57,696 --> 01:16:00,571
Did that girl sing
Should I talk to her?

1209
01:16:00,964 --> 01:16:03,172
Rehman is here.

1210
01:16:03,574 --> 01:16:06,199
He is very eager to
listen to Saroja's voice

1211
01:16:06,375 --> 01:16:09,250
Record it soon and send
it via what's app Poochi

1212
01:16:09,664 --> 01:16:12,039
Is everything going
well as we discussed?

1213
01:16:12,780 --> 01:16:16,113
Why are you hesitant?
Give the phone to Saroja. I will talk

1214
01:16:16,844 --> 01:16:18,511
Vairamuthu sir, Saroja is here

1215
01:16:18,838 --> 01:16:21,213
See the Vairamuthu

1216
01:16:21,238 --> 01:16:22,530
You're Vairamuthu!
- I'm Vairam

1217
01:16:22,905 --> 01:16:24,363
Look here poet Vairamuthu.

1218
01:16:24,708 --> 01:16:26,166
His close friend

1219
01:16:26,363 --> 01:16:29,571
If you are with, you will land
on the streets with a kid

1220
01:16:31,155 --> 01:16:32,672
Do you know what a great
poet Vairamuthu is?

1221
01:16:32,696 --> 01:16:34,736
You don't even have the
privilege of saying his name

1222
01:16:35,053 --> 01:16:37,053
If you are roaming around with these idiots

1223
01:16:37,238 --> 01:16:39,405
Your family is still moaning
the demise of your father

1224
01:16:41,571 --> 01:16:44,363
Fall at her feet and plead
with her to take you back

1225
01:16:44,780 --> 01:16:46,780
What do you think about your voice?

1226
01:16:47,062 --> 01:16:50,738
You are fascinating on some worthless
prize you won in 8th grade,

1227
01:16:51,421 --> 01:16:54,755
The truth is you bray like a donkey

1228
01:16:54,780 --> 01:16:58,863
You better fall at mother's feet
and plead to get back to work

1229
01:16:59,428 --> 01:17:01,261
Else you get lost with him

1230
01:17:01,571 --> 01:17:03,863
If not for these two
options go kill yourself

1231
01:17:04,030 --> 01:17:06,988
Let your family land on the street

1232
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:13,807
I trusted you
Why did you cheat me?

1233
01:17:14,488 --> 01:17:16,488
Why?
- Yes I cheated

1234
01:17:16,975 --> 01:17:18,100
Why?

1235
01:17:19,352 --> 01:17:20,352
Because I love you

1236
01:17:21,701 --> 01:17:24,519
For that not just you, I
will cheat the whole world

1237
01:17:25,825 --> 01:17:26,825
I want to be with you

1238
01:17:27,321 --> 01:17:28,446
That's it

1239
01:17:30,196 --> 01:17:33,405
When I say I want to be with you
It's not like what your uncle says,

1240
01:17:34,363 --> 01:17:35,363
Till the end,

1241
01:17:36,196 --> 01:17:38,196
till death I want to be with you

1242
01:17:38,863 --> 01:17:40,280
You want to be with me till death

1243
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:41,740
You have

1244
01:17:44,059 --> 01:17:46,179
The one who comes to kill me
can come with a free hand

1245
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:47,687
Anyway you have a gun

1246
01:17:47,712 --> 01:17:49,571
In a way that's good

1247
01:17:49,613 --> 01:17:52,446
Only then it will be reported as
Minister shot dead by Naxalites

1248
01:17:53,212 --> 01:17:57,280
Is there some previous unresolved
tension between Minister & Naxalites?

1249
01:17:57,613 --> 01:18:00,380
Is his useless Personal
assistant responsible?

1250
01:18:00,496 --> 01:18:02,412
Is this the reason? Is
that the reason? All the

1251
01:18:02,523 --> 01:18:04,815
television channels will be
screaming about the minister

1252
01:18:05,508 --> 01:18:08,213
At Least this way our respect will grow

1253
01:18:08,238 --> 01:18:09,238
What do you say?
- Yes sir

1254
01:18:09,438 --> 01:18:11,796
So you really think I should be shot dead?

1255
01:18:11,821 --> 01:18:13,541
If it's fine for you I am also fine with it

1256
01:18:13,883 --> 01:18:15,300
Sir I am extremely sorry

1257
01:18:15,613 --> 01:18:17,446
Some tension
- Tension?

1258
01:18:17,641 --> 01:18:19,746
Go to some scenic place and take rest

1259
01:18:19,847 --> 01:18:22,347
I will recommend them to suspend you

1260
01:18:22,821 --> 01:18:24,780
Please sir Pardon me

1261
01:18:24,805 --> 01:18:27,380
If I excuse you further you
will arrange for my funeral

1262
01:18:27,576 --> 01:18:29,590
I should take appropriate
action and remove you

1263
01:18:29,615 --> 01:18:32,293
from the job according
to Government rules

1264
01:18:32,886 --> 01:18:35,469
Go work for the government

1265
01:18:36,023 --> 01:18:38,690
Don't play with politicians

1266
01:18:39,490 --> 01:18:40,490
Get lost

1267
01:18:45,831 --> 01:18:47,831
I just hate your face

1268
01:18:51,963 --> 01:18:53,963
So you suggest we don't give him the gun

1269
01:18:53,988 --> 01:18:56,863
Poochi I beg you

1270
01:18:58,753 --> 01:19:00,253
It will look like you are a pimp

1271
01:19:08,613 --> 01:19:11,696
Don't you know how to signal?
- Without knowing how will I be on the job?

1272
01:19:14,397 --> 01:19:16,605
Be careful!
He's on the search for you

1273
01:19:22,863 --> 01:19:25,696
Your gun isn't it? Let my girl get
down in Tada then I will give it

1274
01:19:27,962 --> 01:19:31,563
You got it isn't it? My love is going
to die Let's resolve our problem later

1275
01:19:31,736 --> 01:19:33,736
Her death is in my hands

1276
01:19:33,761 --> 01:19:35,844
It will make you feel like a pimp

1277
01:19:36,386 --> 01:19:38,678
Am I a pimp for you both

1278
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:44,671
You rot here
Let me kill her and then come and call you

1279
01:19:44,696 --> 01:19:45,696
Hearing that you die

1280
01:19:45,780 --> 01:19:48,280
If something happens to her I will kill you

1281
01:20:00,670 --> 01:20:02,295
He's a good man and I am a scoundrel

1282
01:20:02,461 --> 01:20:04,461
You want me to show how
a scoundrel will behave

1283
01:20:15,569 --> 01:20:17,569
What are you trying to do?

1284
01:20:22,946 --> 01:20:25,863
Sir it's fine spare him
- How can I? He is so disrespectful

1285
01:20:26,912 --> 01:20:29,370
He should be removed from the job

1286
01:20:30,027 --> 01:20:31,755
They are sending him
home as he is useless

1287
01:20:31,780 --> 01:20:32,780
ALP, please stop it!

1288
01:20:32,781 --> 01:20:34,030
He's blaming me for his mistake

1289
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:35,880
Bloody ****

1290
01:20:35,982 --> 01:20:38,607
Is this how you speak to a senior
Mind your words

1291
01:20:40,163 --> 01:20:41,288
This is my last drive

1292
01:20:42,490 --> 01:20:44,781
I wanted to complete my journey honestly

1293
01:20:45,696 --> 01:20:47,696
If he gets in the train
I won't start

1294
01:20:48,321 --> 01:20:50,446
You know the rules right?

1295
01:20:50,842 --> 01:20:53,552
To move and stop the train the guard has
the powers you know those rules don't you?

1296
01:20:53,576 --> 01:20:54,617
You know that rules

1297
01:20:55,113 --> 01:20:58,488
I'll take him into my gurad van,
will change the ALP at Gudur

1298
01:20:59,113 --> 01:21:00,821
Please movie the train

1299
01:21:01,881 --> 01:21:04,297
- Check the brake connectivity
- Sure sir

1300
01:21:05,727 --> 01:21:07,561
I know where I should be, you don't have to

1301
01:21:07,655 --> 01:21:09,488
You go do your work

1302
01:21:10,030 --> 01:21:12,280
- I know what I should do

1303
01:21:12,446 --> 01:21:13,446
Come on

1304
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:18,363
I'm your son, not your slave

1305
01:21:18,484 --> 01:21:20,568
Go check the break activity

1306
01:21:22,292 --> 01:21:23,917
You are trying to dominate me

1307
01:21:24,071 --> 01:21:25,071
I'm going

1308
01:21:26,112 --> 01:21:28,112
I am talking in a composed manner

1309
01:21:28,506 --> 01:21:29,882
You are using unparliamentary
language You think I

1310
01:21:29,906 --> 01:21:31,498
am an old man like him who
will be a mute spectator

1311
01:21:31,522 --> 01:21:34,938
If you are young, you will assault me?

1312
01:22:37,474 --> 01:22:39,849
Hello Sir
I am the guard from 11015

1313
01:22:40,030 --> 01:22:42,189
The train is going without
the guard and assistant

1314
01:22:42,446 --> 01:22:43,988
Ask them to stop the train immediately

1315
01:22:44,552 --> 01:22:46,427
They are sending him
home as he is useless

1316
01:22:46,452 --> 01:22:48,618
LP 11015 come online

1317
01:22:50,098 --> 01:22:53,264
Can you hear me?

1318
01:22:53,488 --> 01:22:56,155
SM Gudur calling, pick the line

1319
01:22:56,905 --> 01:23:01,321
LP 11015 ALP Guard missing

1320
01:23:01,732 --> 01:23:02,732
ALP and guard are missing

1321
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:05,281
Pick the line

1322
01:23:11,397 --> 01:23:12,397
Open the door

1323
01:23:14,482 --> 01:23:15,482
What happened?

1324
01:24:20,308 --> 01:24:23,350
It's about time, The station is approaching
They seem to be running very fast

1325
01:24:25,615 --> 01:24:26,928
Any problem!

1326
01:24:55,391 --> 01:24:57,808
Hey! Don't you feel the train
is going over the normal speed

1327
01:24:59,683 --> 01:25:03,183
I am asking you
- Don't feel, it really is going very fast

1328
01:25:15,308 --> 01:25:18,641
Take out everything

1329
01:25:21,225 --> 01:25:23,516
Don't try pulling the chain

1330
01:25:23,850 --> 01:25:24,850
Remove the jewellery

1331
01:25:25,225 --> 01:25:26,558
Remove the jewellery

1332
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:29,350
Remove it all

1333
01:25:30,641 --> 01:25:31,641
Laptops...

1334
01:25:59,350 --> 01:26:01,975
Move away

1335
01:26:05,933 --> 01:26:08,933
Shut up!
If you shout out I'll kill the kid

1336
01:26:11,308 --> 01:26:15,975
Shut up!
Give the bag

1337
01:26:20,475 --> 01:26:23,141
I pulled the chain
The train didn't stop

1338
01:26:33,891 --> 01:26:36,725
Train number 11015 DC
express out of control

1339
01:26:37,172 --> 01:26:39,422
They are not stopping?

1340
01:26:39,891 --> 01:26:43,558
You haven't put the signal for that train
Not yet sir

1341
01:26:44,345 --> 01:26:47,283
DC 11015 out of control
they didn't stop at Odur

1342
01:26:47,308 --> 01:26:50,183
- Didn't stop?
- Start indicting it's danger

1343
01:26:51,162 --> 01:26:53,953
Turn the signal to danger

1344
01:26:56,878 --> 01:27:00,253
Vehicle did not stop here too
- It didn't stop there too!

1345
01:27:04,633 --> 01:27:07,425
Hello, can you hear me

1346
01:27:07,912 --> 01:27:10,620
Can you hear me?
Hello Sir

1347
01:27:17,349 --> 01:27:20,265
DC express has not stopped at Gudur or Odur

1348
01:27:21,555 --> 01:27:22,555
What happened?

1349
01:27:22,866 --> 01:27:24,866
How can you not panic?

1350
01:27:24,891 --> 01:27:27,558
Why should we panic? Only those
inside the train should panic

1351
01:27:28,654 --> 01:27:30,945
In times like this we
should work with clarity

1352
01:27:32,147 --> 01:27:33,688
All stations please note

1353
01:27:34,253 --> 01:27:38,670
train no 11015 DC express
running out of control

1354
01:27:39,173 --> 01:27:42,680
Regulate all the standing
trains to loop line

1355
01:27:43,214 --> 01:27:46,047
Check the points on the main line
and give passage to DC express

1356
01:27:50,075 --> 01:27:53,700
Did the guard or LP communicate?
The guard spoke to the Gudur station master

1357
01:27:54,115 --> 01:27:57,656
What did he say? That morning the train
hit a heard of cows near Gudur station

1358
01:27:57,826 --> 01:28:00,326
That time there was a tiff
between the LP and ALP

1359
01:28:00,717 --> 01:28:02,717
From then the ALP & Guard were missing

1360
01:28:02,742 --> 01:28:05,159
The LP is not taking calls

1361
01:28:06,558 --> 01:28:08,584
Inform the department
and disrupt the power

1362
01:28:08,609 --> 01:28:10,484
supply and stop the train
- It's a diesel loco

1363
01:28:11,492 --> 01:28:14,159
Then it should have a
vigilance control device

1364
01:28:14,424 --> 01:28:16,591
For every 60 seconds if
there is no horn or no

1365
01:28:16,616 --> 01:28:19,100
operations the train
will stop automatically

1366
01:28:19,125 --> 01:28:21,125
It's not a modified loco

1367
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:26,074
Listen from Gudur to Central shut
down all the manned level cross

1368
01:28:26,075 --> 01:28:28,658
For the un manned level
crossing send an alter Also

1369
01:28:28,683 --> 01:28:31,266
inform all the centres
police station, fire station

1370
01:28:32,969 --> 01:28:35,719
We need to essentially keep
this away from the media

1371
01:28:36,714 --> 01:28:39,964
Such a big train issue? Without
media glare? - Of course

1372
01:28:40,990 --> 01:28:42,948
A person like you is a DRO

1373
01:28:43,022 --> 01:28:45,022
The TT is on the phone

1374
01:28:46,206 --> 01:28:49,873
What's happening?

1375
01:28:50,116 --> 01:28:51,908
Before Gudur there was an accident

1376
01:28:52,019 --> 01:28:53,769
We received that information

1377
01:28:54,052 --> 01:28:55,408
Did you contact LP Devaraj?

1378
01:28:55,433 --> 01:28:57,153
We are trying to call him
He's not answering

1379
01:28:57,211 --> 01:28:58,961
Did you try to pull the emergency chain?

1380
01:28:59,164 --> 01:29:00,623
We tried pulling the chain

1381
01:29:00,866 --> 01:29:02,241
Then what is the problem?

1382
01:29:02,266 --> 01:29:06,475
I think after the accident
where they hit the cows

1383
01:29:07,391 --> 01:29:09,640
They probably didn't check
the break connectivity

1384
01:29:09,641 --> 01:29:12,058
After the accident if the LP and
ALP had checked the pressure

1385
01:29:12,373 --> 01:29:14,623
gauge Then when you pull the
chain the train should stop

1386
01:29:15,016 --> 01:29:16,516
I agree with all that you are saying

1387
01:29:16,933 --> 01:29:18,308
What should we do now?

1388
01:29:19,180 --> 01:29:20,930
The speed here is abnormal

1389
01:29:21,274 --> 01:29:22,899
The passengers are in a shock

1390
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:26,726
You ensure that the passengers
don't panic and comfort them

1391
01:29:28,053 --> 01:29:29,053
Sir we feel scared

1392
01:29:29,078 --> 01:29:32,037
Don't be scared we will take care
If you have any information let us know

1393
01:29:33,701 --> 01:29:34,701
Confirmed sir

1394
01:29:35,216 --> 01:29:36,216
Sure

1395
01:29:37,444 --> 01:29:38,860
Sir the berth is confirmed

1396
01:29:39,836 --> 01:29:41,836
What?
- Berth confirmed?

1397
01:29:43,158 --> 01:29:44,158
I am talking

1398
01:29:44,330 --> 01:29:46,330
Your higher authorities
are dragging you too much

1399
01:29:46,676 --> 01:29:48,825
It is dragging

1400
01:29:49,069 --> 01:29:51,194
It will be confirmed
before we reach Chennai

1401
01:29:51,308 --> 01:29:52,641
It will be confirmed before we go

1402
01:29:53,561 --> 01:29:54,561
Departing is confirmed

1403
01:29:54,609 --> 01:29:57,318
What? - I said before reaching
Chennai it will be confirmed

1404
01:29:58,070 --> 01:29:59,654
Please speed up

1405
01:29:59,683 --> 01:30:02,350
Speed up! It will do it involuntarily

1406
01:30:04,334 --> 01:30:06,917
When a cow hits, it's horns
would have damaged the valves

1407
01:30:07,229 --> 01:30:10,187
They would have departed without checking
That's were the error is!

1408
01:30:10,350 --> 01:30:11,670
So you say the story is nailed up

1409
01:30:11,933 --> 01:30:13,701
Of course, They didn't check
the break connectivity Without

1410
01:30:13,725 --> 01:30:15,742
it the break is not functioning
and hence unable to stop

1411
01:30:15,766 --> 01:30:18,350
What you say is acceptable
for a driverless train

1412
01:30:18,766 --> 01:30:21,891
In this there is a LP and a
safety valve close to it

1413
01:30:22,534 --> 01:30:25,450
If the pressure is released the
train will stop automatically

1414
01:30:25,475 --> 01:30:28,058
He is not doing it
Something is happening there

1415
01:30:28,795 --> 01:30:29,795
We'll inform GM

1416
01:30:30,641 --> 01:30:32,600
They are just talking,
would the stop the train

1417
01:30:32,641 --> 01:30:35,183
Government works they would
discuss a lot and finalise it

1418
01:30:36,016 --> 01:30:38,016
Be serious

1419
01:30:53,671 --> 01:30:59,255
There is an RPF team inside the train,
It's better we get to the roof

1420
01:31:01,558 --> 01:31:03,849
Nowadays there is no security for
the common man, If such thing

1421
01:31:03,850 --> 01:31:06,558
happens to the police then whats
the state of the ordinary citizen

1422
01:31:06,841 --> 01:31:08,216
Maya can you hear us?

1423
01:31:09,396 --> 01:31:11,687
We are now in TADA railway station

1424
01:31:11,850 --> 01:31:14,850
Awhile ago the DC express that was
scheduled to stop here did not do so

1425
01:31:15,558 --> 01:31:18,350
Further they have shot a RPF and he
was thrown out of the moving train

1426
01:31:18,787 --> 01:31:20,953
This place is in a state of tension

1427
01:31:21,323 --> 01:31:23,412
It's very important to
note that the Minister for

1428
01:31:23,437 --> 01:31:26,700
Renewable energy MR Rangarajan
is traveling in this train

1429
01:31:27,162 --> 01:31:31,658
It's speculated that the terrorist
have planned this attack to kidnap him

1430
01:31:31,941 --> 01:31:34,858
We have no answers on the
number of people traveling

1431
01:31:35,289 --> 01:31:37,664
on this train and what's
their present state

1432
01:31:38,242 --> 01:31:41,324
If we have further news we will

1433
01:31:41,325 --> 01:31:43,408
The minister kidnapped on
DC express MR Rangarajan is

1434
01:31:43,433 --> 01:31:45,600
from a small town called
Chinnamangalam near Bhuvangiri

1435
01:31:45,934 --> 01:31:49,184
Inspire of hailing from a remote village
which had no proper educational

1436
01:31:49,209 --> 01:31:52,667
institutions, He walked 12 Kms
everyday to complete his education

1437
01:31:52,891 --> 01:31:56,891
In his youth he participated against
the Hindi movement in the rail protest

1438
01:31:57,674 --> 01:32:02,549
Apart from that - I thought they
would bring up the Padma scandal

1439
01:32:16,338 --> 01:32:20,421
Hey there's a girl near
the engine, zoom on her

1440
01:32:33,530 --> 01:32:37,030
Headlines for today
The DC express from Delhi to

1441
01:32:37,055 --> 01:32:40,764
Chennai is under the captivity
of a woman terrorist

1442
01:32:41,058 --> 01:32:43,725
There are 6 terrorists
seated on top of the moving

1443
01:32:43,766 --> 01:32:46,600
train, we have no idea how
many more are there inside

1444
01:32:52,937 --> 01:32:56,729
If you look at the terrorist
activities, it's an ongoing process

1445
01:32:57,459 --> 01:33:00,834
What's the root cause for this?
Can this be averted or not?

1446
01:33:01,373 --> 01:33:04,664
To debate on this we have with us today
some eminent people in our studio

1447
01:33:05,393 --> 01:33:08,280
First it's MR Sadasivam, party propaganda
executive of SDK political party

1448
01:33:08,304 --> 01:33:10,888
Mr Pugalmannan, regional
leader, DJK political, party

1449
01:33:11,058 --> 01:33:13,475
MR Tamilselvan, opposition party

1450
01:33:14,225 --> 01:33:17,516
Doctor Edward physiatrist
and social reformist

1451
01:33:18,183 --> 01:33:20,433
My first question, I would
like to start with you Doctor

1452
01:33:21,058 --> 01:33:23,850
This train is under the
siege of a woman terrorist

1453
01:33:24,698 --> 01:33:29,990
If a woman can handle such a task,
what will be her state of mind

1454
01:33:30,433 --> 01:33:33,016
As a physiatrist what's
your view, please tell us

1455
01:33:33,547 --> 01:33:37,339
Looking at the television footage, she
appears to mentally very disturbed

1456
01:33:38,138 --> 01:33:43,638
The position in which she is seated, The
panic with which she is holding the railings

1457
01:33:43,891 --> 01:33:48,141
The tension on her face, personifies
that she needs some security

1458
01:33:48,522 --> 01:33:51,897
According to me she does
not look like a terrorist

1459
01:33:52,060 --> 01:33:54,018
She appears to be mentally disturbed

1460
01:33:55,586 --> 01:34:00,878
Will terrorist come formally dressed in
suits? Such woman terrorist will come from

1461
01:34:01,141 --> 01:34:05,183
Mr Pugalmannan, please wait for your
allotted time Please voice your views then

1462
01:34:05,643 --> 01:34:06,935
The entire nation is watching us

1463
01:34:07,558 --> 01:34:09,724
You please tell us Doctor
- From the series of

1464
01:34:09,725 --> 01:34:12,016
incidents the girl does
not look like a terrorist

1465
01:34:12,408 --> 01:34:14,575
It appears that she is a
mentally disturbed person

1466
01:34:14,825 --> 01:34:18,200
When the everyone believe
that the girl is a terrorist

1467
01:34:18,459 --> 01:34:22,875
The doctor has brought out a new dimension
saying she isn't and is mentally unstable

1468
01:34:23,449 --> 01:34:25,741
Hey they are saying that the
touch up girl is a terrorist

1469
01:34:25,766 --> 01:34:27,975
We are inside and we know it
How will those outside know

1470
01:34:28,100 --> 01:34:31,391
Does Poochi know this?
- Call him quickly?

1471
01:34:32,516 --> 01:34:33,516
It's ringing

1472
01:34:35,461 --> 01:34:36,878
It's ringing?

1473
01:34:37,659 --> 01:34:38,659
Show it!

1474
01:34:40,573 --> 01:34:42,308
Is he already in search for her

1475
01:34:45,266 --> 01:34:48,600
I am just entering the headquarters
I will update you after talking to the DRM

1476
01:34:55,951 --> 01:34:57,576
I'm Sultan, DIG railway protection force

1477
01:34:58,506 --> 01:35:00,226
I think you are well aware of the situation

1478
01:35:01,023 --> 01:35:02,743
I want the entire details of the DC Express

1479
01:35:04,459 --> 01:35:07,500
I want the passenger name list Most
importantly the details of the LP and ALP

1480
01:35:08,211 --> 01:35:10,211
Make it fast

1481
01:35:10,691 --> 01:35:13,774
We can get it sir

1482
01:35:16,127 --> 01:35:20,081
Jack, we need to stop the train today
- We can stop it Sir

1483
01:35:20,183 --> 01:35:22,100
Sir! How come they are here?

1484
01:35:22,811 --> 01:35:26,986
This is a control room for namesake,
they will have the control from now

1485
01:35:27,479 --> 01:35:30,104
Save our Central minister

1486
01:35:30,487 --> 01:35:33,112
The train is coming at a speed of 120 Kms
Are you playing around?

1487
01:35:33,737 --> 01:35:35,128
We are not auto drivers

1488
01:35:35,632 --> 01:35:37,491
We are politicians

1489
01:35:37,516 --> 01:35:39,266
Get our minister out

1490
01:35:39,375 --> 01:35:40,832
First let's stop the train and
then handle the rest Listen

1491
01:35:40,856 --> 01:35:43,067
to us, Else go to a different
track and raise your slogans

1492
01:35:43,091 --> 01:35:45,283
You are telling us about changing tracks!

1493
01:35:45,377 --> 01:35:48,085
You know how many tracks we
change before a Government ends

1494
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:51,076
We will run in one track and skip across
another track in the same speed we will

1495
01:35:51,100 --> 01:35:53,225
Jump another track

1496
01:35:53,475 --> 01:35:55,475
If we get caught in that we will also run

1497
01:35:55,899 --> 01:35:56,899
Shut up

1498
01:35:57,373 --> 01:35:59,581
Sir the train is approaching
at reckless speed

1499
01:35:59,808 --> 01:36:01,325
What reckless speed?

1500
01:36:01,397 --> 01:36:03,741
We are restless and inconsolable
that we have lost our leader

1501
01:36:03,765 --> 01:36:05,765
I challenge the train to try and go past me

1502
01:36:06,033 --> 01:36:08,658
Don't take it Only after our
leader steps out of that train

1503
01:36:08,700 --> 01:36:10,342
The train is now handled
by a terrorist and not

1504
01:36:10,366 --> 01:36:12,159
the driver who will
understand your sentiments

1505
01:36:12,183 --> 01:36:15,627
That's just a terrorist our
leader is a curse to the society

1506
01:36:15,891 --> 01:36:17,251
I meant a crusader for the society

1507
01:36:19,266 --> 01:36:20,957
Give us our leader! Give us our leader!

1508
01:36:20,982 --> 01:36:23,972
If we hit they will be squashed

1509
01:36:24,283 --> 01:36:28,158
How come no one around?

1510
01:36:28,307 --> 01:36:30,890
It's your growing popularity

1511
01:36:34,095 --> 01:36:36,262
We can't eradicate such
diseases from the country

1512
01:36:36,466 --> 01:36:38,424
When we get a chance we
should just clean it

1513
01:36:38,984 --> 01:36:41,109
We should at least call for the Ambulance

1514
01:36:41,602 --> 01:36:44,167
No need sir. After it's over the corporation
authorities will wipe out this garbage

1515
01:36:44,191 --> 01:36:45,311
Sir the train is approaching

1516
01:36:46,010 --> 01:36:48,718
Clear everyone

1517
01:36:50,956 --> 01:36:52,499
The trains approaching?

1518
01:36:52,524 --> 01:36:55,233
Any driver usually horns
when there is a crowd

1519
01:36:55,669 --> 01:36:57,210
He is silently approaching

1520
01:36:57,266 --> 01:37:00,391
He's intimated by your presence
that's why he isn't using the horn

1521
01:37:02,357 --> 01:37:05,273
Boss it appears to be very fast

1522
01:37:06,814 --> 01:37:07,814
It's coming

1523
01:37:09,725 --> 01:37:12,350
You are exiting without telling
who your political hier is

1524
01:37:20,190 --> 01:37:23,148
Your party Central minister Rangarajan
is travelling on this train

1525
01:37:23,725 --> 01:37:25,814
It's because of him that they are
holding this train as hostage

1526
01:37:25,838 --> 01:37:28,755
What's your view and what's
your party's stand on this?

1527
01:37:29,475 --> 01:37:31,266
I should thank the terrorist

1528
01:37:31,870 --> 01:37:35,245
40 years of political career
gained visibility through this day

1529
01:37:35,703 --> 01:37:39,495
For your kind heart you should
have kidnapped you 40 years ago

1530
01:37:42,725 --> 01:37:44,725
See Rangarajan is not
such an eminent person

1531
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:46,700
I was just gaining popularity

1532
01:37:46,857 --> 01:37:50,773
They are sending him through a train
and not a flight so you can understand

1533
01:37:51,435 --> 01:37:53,076
Do you know who he is? Do you
know about his simplicity?

1534
01:37:53,100 --> 01:37:54,284
That's why he still
takes the train

1535
01:37:54,308 --> 01:37:55,628
They don't give me flight tickets

1536
01:37:56,080 --> 01:37:59,038
When the news of his kidnap came
out, the entire nation is burning

1537
01:37:59,516 --> 01:38:02,825
Even the Prime Minister
expressed his condolences

1538
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:05,975
I meant expressed his strong dissent

1539
01:38:06,891 --> 01:38:09,975
If you let jokers speak

1540
01:38:12,516 --> 01:38:14,364
As the central minister
is traveling there should

1541
01:38:14,388 --> 01:38:16,430
be 2 commandos traveling
with him Contact them

1542
01:38:17,638 --> 01:38:20,596
Is there any other source
to stop this train?

1543
01:38:21,266 --> 01:38:22,266
There is no way

1544
01:38:22,516 --> 01:38:24,226
If this is a train carrying
just consignments we

1545
01:38:24,250 --> 01:38:26,050
can stack sand bags and
try and stop the train

1546
01:38:28,725 --> 01:38:31,319
Else we set a skid and
derail it from the track

1547
01:38:33,182 --> 01:38:38,140
Failing which we set it such that it
clashes buffer to buffer and derail it

1548
01:38:42,491 --> 01:38:44,866
But we have several passengers
inside It can result

1549
01:38:44,914 --> 01:38:47,414
in a huge accident and we
cannot take such a big risk

1550
01:38:49,973 --> 01:38:52,734
Sir Central Minister's security

1551
01:38:53,420 --> 01:38:55,420
Sir I am DIG Sultan, here

1552
01:38:58,779 --> 01:38:59,991
The mister is safe?

1553
01:39:00,015 --> 01:39:02,071
The Minster is safe, no problem Sir

1554
01:39:03,016 --> 01:39:05,241
I just got a call from NSG Head quarters

1555
01:39:05,266 --> 01:39:06,540
Call from head quarters?

1556
01:39:07,506 --> 01:39:08,506
What did they say?

1557
01:39:18,100 --> 01:39:20,433
Contact him. connect me with him

1558
01:39:23,885 --> 01:39:25,593
What?

1559
01:39:25,766 --> 01:39:29,016
NSG Commandos have
assembled near Gumudipondi

1560
01:39:29,472 --> 01:39:33,430
Sir I think to save the minister,
they have some incorrect plan

1561
01:39:34,492 --> 01:39:36,742
Sir there are 742 passengers on this train

1562
01:39:37,296 --> 01:39:39,755
One wrong move
Everyone's life is in jeopardy

1563
01:39:42,877 --> 01:39:44,585
Got it Sir
I will wait for the next move

1564
01:39:54,014 --> 01:39:58,639
I trusted you
Why did you cheat me

1565
01:40:01,612 --> 01:40:07,487
I thought you would have escaped long ago
She's in the engine

1566
01:40:10,008 --> 01:40:13,967
Is she really a terrorist? I am not
saying it, everyone outside says so

1567
01:40:14,016 --> 01:40:16,016
You know what's the burning headlines?

1568
01:40:16,815 --> 01:40:19,023
That she has hijacked this
train and its in her control

1569
01:40:19,453 --> 01:40:21,078
Just one unfulfilled wish

1570
01:40:21,365 --> 01:40:23,698
Wanted to kill her with my hands

1571
01:40:25,961 --> 01:40:29,045
It's fine
My department will handle that

1572
01:40:30,225 --> 01:40:32,225
That gives me immense joy

1573
01:40:34,429 --> 01:40:36,429
Our snipers out there

1574
01:40:37,100 --> 01:40:41,516
Have the latest riffle M110
Just one trigger

1575
01:40:42,016 --> 01:40:46,016
and 50 bullets will strike out

1576
01:40:46,850 --> 01:40:49,891
She will be scattered as blood and flesh
Just like minced meat

1577
01:40:51,586 --> 01:40:52,711
I'll let you free then

1578
01:40:53,388 --> 01:40:55,929
Then go and gather her
There you can continue

1579
01:40:56,089 --> 01:40:58,714
your romance and laugh
to your heart's content

1580
01:41:00,334 --> 01:41:01,334
Get lost

1581
01:41:01,555 --> 01:41:04,639
I am extremely annoyed
I will hack you to death

1582
01:41:06,100 --> 01:41:08,100
What?
You didn't hear it

1583
01:41:08,266 --> 01:41:09,266
Son of a *******

1584
01:41:09,433 --> 01:41:12,558
You didn't understand I called
you the son of a ******

1585
01:41:14,683 --> 01:41:17,683
In a rush don't try and come in

1586
01:41:20,516 --> 01:41:22,391
If you are here you will die

1587
01:44:31,474 --> 01:44:34,307
Oh no!
Why are you guys shooting me?

1588
01:45:00,099 --> 01:45:02,661
Catch him!
He is falling down

1589
01:47:33,099 --> 01:47:34,782
Why have you come here now?

1590
01:47:34,807 --> 01:47:36,224
All this is because of you

1591
01:47:36,432 --> 01:47:37,432
Lie low!

1592
01:47:37,557 --> 01:47:40,890
I am never gonna sing for you again,

1593
01:47:41,116 --> 01:47:43,116
Lie down

1594
01:47:45,599 --> 01:47:48,599
How can you talk like
this in this situation?

1595
01:47:48,890 --> 01:47:49,890
Damn!

1596
01:47:52,140 --> 01:47:54,140
They are gonna shoot

1597
01:47:54,265 --> 01:47:55,640
Shoot... Shoot me

1598
01:47:59,015 --> 01:48:01,236
You can hear me in this
catch it!

1599
01:48:03,724 --> 01:48:04,724
Pick it up!

1600
01:48:05,432 --> 01:48:07,432
You are hitting me

1601
01:48:08,648 --> 01:48:10,732
Talk back, Can you hear me?

1602
01:48:12,682 --> 01:48:13,932
They are gonna shoot you

1603
01:48:14,765 --> 01:48:17,224
Sir, Please don't shoot

1604
01:48:56,724 --> 01:48:58,140
You fine, right?

1605
01:48:59,099 --> 01:49:01,932
Pick up the walkie talkie
Pick it up!

1606
01:49:04,390 --> 01:49:05,390
Be careful!

1607
01:49:18,474 --> 01:49:20,182
You fine?

1608
01:49:20,765 --> 01:49:21,765
You?

1609
01:49:23,015 --> 01:49:25,015
I'm fine

1610
01:49:30,705 --> 01:49:32,997
Why are they shooting me?

1611
01:49:33,359 --> 01:49:35,359
They think you are a terrorist

1612
01:49:35,807 --> 01:49:38,765
Me a terrorist!
Are they fools!

1613
01:49:39,182 --> 01:49:40,182
They too are fools

1614
01:49:43,166 --> 01:49:45,166
The snipers didn't shoot at the terrorists

1615
01:49:45,959 --> 01:49:49,168
They aimed at the Safety brake switch at
the right hand corner of the diesel loco

1616
01:49:49,615 --> 01:49:51,115
If they had hit it

1617
01:49:51,157 --> 01:49:53,407
The safety valve would have opened

1618
01:49:53,432 --> 01:49:55,845
And the diesel would have drained
and we could have stopped the train

1619
01:49:55,869 --> 01:49:58,994
It would have been easier for us to start
the negotiation, that was our plan

1620
01:50:01,665 --> 01:50:05,707
Our snipers are one of the best, they can
take down the terrorist in a single shot

1621
01:50:06,150 --> 01:50:08,775
They why dint they shoot
at the brake switch

1622
01:50:10,067 --> 01:50:11,067
Try to understand

1623
01:50:12,390 --> 01:50:15,015
It was a fast moving train
The target was very small

1624
01:50:15,474 --> 01:50:18,265
And with that girl running around
It was a big disturbance

1625
01:50:22,182 --> 01:50:25,599
They would shoot at the diesel tank,
drain it out and stop the train

1626
01:50:25,932 --> 01:50:26,932
If all are gone!

1627
01:50:27,515 --> 01:50:29,515
This is the conspiracy
of the opposition party

1628
01:50:29,849 --> 01:50:31,849
Let something happen to the minister

1629
01:50:32,251 --> 01:50:34,189
It is not the opposition party,
It is the NSG

1630
01:50:34,224 --> 01:50:35,224
That's your party right

1631
01:50:35,369 --> 01:50:36,702
National Security Guard

1632
01:50:37,099 --> 01:50:38,099
Educate him!

1633
01:50:38,100 --> 01:50:39,932
Leave it!
He doesn't know much

1634
01:50:40,432 --> 01:50:42,432
Ask them if they would come for an alliance

1635
01:50:42,949 --> 01:50:45,224
Is there any treatment for these guys

1636
01:50:48,890 --> 01:50:51,515
Are they dead?

1637
01:50:54,803 --> 01:50:55,803
What happened?

1638
01:50:56,140 --> 01:50:58,515
Are they not dead?

1639
01:50:58,807 --> 01:51:03,099
The boy and girl on the roof top

1640
01:51:05,140 --> 01:51:06,140
They are not dead?

1641
01:51:06,182 --> 01:51:08,849
- Those 2 terrorist are not dead?
- Which terrorist?

1642
01:51:09,182 --> 01:51:10,974
Sir, Poochiyappan

1643
01:51:11,311 --> 01:51:13,811
He is no vendor
he is a trained terrorist

1644
01:51:14,224 --> 01:51:16,890
He is anti-national,
He will kill us all

1645
01:51:17,224 --> 01:51:19,765
Before that we must kill him!

1646
01:51:21,390 --> 01:51:23,550
Please take care of him
Come on, let's go to the pantry

1647
01:51:25,325 --> 01:51:27,178
Shall we go on the roof
and attack the terrorist

1648
01:51:27,202 --> 01:51:29,744
Let's first enquire in the
pantry and then decide on it

1649
01:51:31,057 --> 01:51:33,015
If you don't, I'll kill him

1650
01:51:34,731 --> 01:51:36,647
Give 2 biscuit packets

1651
01:51:37,947 --> 01:51:39,239
Take it dear

1652
01:51:39,525 --> 01:51:41,324
- how much?
- Don't need any money

1653
01:51:41,349 --> 01:51:42,349
That's not needed leave!

1654
01:51:43,224 --> 01:51:45,432
Are you gifting it to them?

1655
01:51:45,572 --> 01:51:48,452
We don't know if we would reach home
alive and you want to make money now

1656
01:51:49,682 --> 01:51:51,990
One thing, You kept your word

1657
01:51:52,015 --> 01:51:52,765
What?

1658
01:51:52,890 --> 01:51:54,724
- You hijacked the train - who
- you

1659
01:51:56,599 --> 01:51:58,849
Don't say such a
thing even as a joke

1660
01:51:59,726 --> 01:52:03,226
Poochiyappan is your assistant and every
channel is saying him to be the main terrorist

1661
01:52:03,765 --> 01:52:06,099
His lover that girl has
taken control of the train

1662
01:52:06,640 --> 01:52:07,640
You are the captain

1663
01:52:07,682 --> 01:52:09,890
You are running an organisation

1664
01:52:10,111 --> 01:52:12,278
What do you mean terrorist camp?

1665
01:52:12,630 --> 01:52:14,755
Would they jail our sir and the heroine

1666
01:52:15,390 --> 01:52:16,390
Even the heroine?

1667
01:52:16,432 --> 01:52:19,349
They arrested all the heroine
in Dawoods link, right?

1668
01:52:19,474 --> 01:52:21,557
Similarly, the heroines in your link too

1669
01:52:21,991 --> 01:52:24,282
You sent you heart in that cutlet right?

1670
01:52:24,307 --> 01:52:26,057
Is that your code word?

1671
01:52:26,432 --> 01:52:27,765
Code word sir?

1672
01:52:28,252 --> 01:52:30,627
- Is it a mistake to give a cutlet?
- Yes it is

1673
01:52:31,182 --> 01:52:33,390
They murdered a leader a long back

1674
01:52:33,849 --> 01:52:37,409
Those who aided the
killer by buying him tea,

1675
01:52:37,434 --> 01:52:39,365
let him park his cycle,
buying him a battery

1676
01:52:39,390 --> 01:52:41,390
They are in prison for 20 years

1677
01:52:42,182 --> 01:52:44,015
If they are in such a mess

1678
01:52:44,099 --> 01:52:47,474
You are going to dump a whole train

1679
01:52:47,861 --> 01:52:49,944
What all would they do to you?

1680
01:52:50,140 --> 01:52:51,432
He would die in there

1681
01:52:51,765 --> 01:52:53,765
They won't keep him for that long

1682
01:52:54,140 --> 01:52:55,974
They would hang him on
a birthday this year

1683
01:52:57,062 --> 01:52:58,062
Whose birthday?

1684
01:52:58,140 --> 01:52:59,140
Your birthday

1685
01:52:59,307 --> 01:53:00,842
Don't scare me

1686
01:53:00,888 --> 01:53:02,763
This is to get you prepared for all that

1687
01:53:03,171 --> 01:53:05,171
They would arrest us all in a while

1688
01:53:05,991 --> 01:53:10,741
They will shred you to pieces with
investigation, enquiry, etc..

1689
01:53:11,432 --> 01:53:15,140
We are bachelors can sit
with our inner's anywhere

1690
01:53:16,099 --> 01:53:18,640
It's horrible to think of you

1691
01:53:19,265 --> 01:53:21,265
You never have a habit
of wearing any inner's

1692
01:53:22,724 --> 01:53:26,349
When they make you lie
on the ice and bash you

1693
01:53:26,765 --> 01:53:28,890
They would tear you apart

1694
01:53:29,865 --> 01:53:30,865
Stop it!

1695
01:53:30,890 --> 01:53:33,432
The terrorist in him is peeking out

1696
01:53:33,653 --> 01:53:36,319
He was just acting around all these days

1697
01:53:37,765 --> 01:53:40,557
Who is a comedian?
I am a genuine terrorist

1698
01:53:44,849 --> 01:53:48,515
I am the south Indian chief to
all these World terrorist groups

1699
01:53:49,515 --> 01:53:53,099
You are scared right?
Are you trying to scare me

1700
01:53:54,099 --> 01:53:57,182
Do you think it was mere groceries that got
loaded in Nagpur

1701
01:53:57,682 --> 01:53:59,640
It is all bombs

1702
01:54:00,057 --> 01:54:01,974
I've fixed it in the train

1703
01:54:01,998 --> 01:54:06,207
In half an hour it will blow
up to a radius of 2 kms

1704
01:54:06,577 --> 01:54:08,244
If you escape from that

1705
01:54:08,356 --> 01:54:10,606
I'll shoot you down with a AK-57

1706
01:54:17,955 --> 01:54:19,955
This was why you all stood up..

1707
01:54:20,474 --> 01:54:22,474
You could have informed me

1708
01:54:22,932 --> 01:54:24,932
Guards search him!!

1709
01:54:29,317 --> 01:54:31,692
One minute, I'll pass it sir

1710
01:54:33,599 --> 01:54:35,599
They are live from Unmai TV

1711
01:54:38,393 --> 01:54:40,740
- Hello
- Greetings minister sir

1712
01:54:40,765 --> 01:54:46,015
The Minister from DC
Express in live with us

1713
01:54:46,408 --> 01:54:48,490
You called me and who are you speaking to?

1714
01:54:48,515 --> 01:54:52,099
How was the experience when
the terrorists kidnapped you?

1715
01:54:53,307 --> 01:54:56,099
They are asking about the
kidnapping like a love experience

1716
01:54:56,970 --> 01:54:58,970
It is nice!

1717
01:55:01,374 --> 01:55:04,035
Did any of the terrorists come meet you?

1718
01:55:04,060 --> 01:55:06,977
Was there any secret requests?

1719
01:55:07,929 --> 01:55:10,638
If there were any please do tell it
The audience will enjoy it

1720
01:55:10,804 --> 01:55:13,471
No one met me
and there was no messages too

1721
01:55:15,349 --> 01:55:16,724
- No one?
- Yes

1722
01:55:17,182 --> 01:55:18,862
Then you tell something for the terrorists

1723
01:55:20,026 --> 01:55:22,484
Gopal, would the terrorists listen to me?

1724
01:55:22,640 --> 01:55:24,765
- Surely not!
- You know

1725
01:55:26,057 --> 01:55:28,807
I want to clarify one
thing to the terrorist

1726
01:55:29,104 --> 01:55:32,021
In my 40 years of political
life, my people are everything

1727
01:55:33,075 --> 01:55:35,366
There are 700-800 people
traveling in this train

1728
01:55:36,562 --> 01:55:38,562
Keep me as a bait

1729
01:55:39,515 --> 01:55:41,640
But not a single person in
this train should get hurt

1730
01:55:42,569 --> 01:55:44,569
Instead take my life

1731
01:55:44,765 --> 01:55:46,265
Do you mean it?

1732
01:55:47,599 --> 01:55:51,849
You heard it! Do you need anything
more for our ministers courage

1733
01:55:51,974 --> 01:55:54,091
Courage? Our Rangaranjan,
Please!

1734
01:55:54,116 --> 01:55:57,825
He was invited to speak at a
meeting in Gobichettipalayam

1735
01:55:58,340 --> 01:56:00,923
Someone shouted he would
be stoned if he speaks

1736
01:56:01,070 --> 01:56:02,862
Just a stone, not a bomb

1737
01:56:03,229 --> 01:56:07,224
Hearing that he ran away without a trace

1738
01:56:07,390 --> 01:56:09,949
Is this courage, isn't this cowardice

1739
01:56:09,974 --> 01:56:11,515
He is a coward

1740
01:56:11,606 --> 01:56:14,314
Is this how you talk
about a Central minister

1741
01:56:14,695 --> 01:56:16,695
Why are seating people
with no political decorum?

1742
01:56:16,974 --> 01:56:18,453
What are you talking?

1743
01:56:18,478 --> 01:56:21,603
- What did I?
- You called the minister to be a coward

1744
01:56:22,361 --> 01:56:23,361
I?

1745
01:56:24,411 --> 01:56:26,411
He is not accepting what he said

1746
01:56:27,036 --> 01:56:31,536
Mr. Pugalmannan you called the
central minister a coward

1747
01:56:34,382 --> 01:56:39,091
Mr. Pugalmannan you were the one who
said the central minister to be a coward

1748
01:56:39,569 --> 01:56:43,236
You are the one saying so, he said
it a while back, when did I say it?

1749
01:56:43,515 --> 01:56:45,682
Did I say so?

1750
01:56:46,140 --> 01:56:47,140
You said so

1751
01:56:47,474 --> 01:56:49,474
You too have joined with them

1752
01:56:49,905 --> 01:56:54,155
Such derogatory terms will never come
from me, And I didn't speak such a thing

1753
01:56:54,744 --> 01:56:55,744
It's true!

1754
01:56:56,384 --> 01:56:58,426
Replay it, lets see the truth

1755
01:56:59,411 --> 01:57:01,099
You are the one to be ashamed

1756
01:57:01,150 --> 01:57:05,525
Mr.Pugalmannan, if I replay it you
will be exposed to the entire nation

1757
01:57:23,928 --> 01:57:25,648
How many days is that girl working for you?

1758
01:57:25,673 --> 01:57:28,757
He is the one who got us that girl

1759
01:57:29,124 --> 01:57:30,333
Only he introduced

1760
01:57:31,890 --> 01:57:34,474
- How is she related to you?
- She is my sister's daughter

1761
01:57:34,807 --> 01:57:36,974
My sister's son No, daughter

1762
01:57:37,574 --> 01:57:39,574
She is innocent sir

1763
01:57:39,599 --> 01:57:40,865
That we'll take care of

1764
01:57:40,890 --> 01:57:43,099
Sir, I too am innocent

1765
01:57:43,182 --> 01:57:46,349
Catch hold of him sir!

1766
01:57:49,489 --> 01:57:53,947
Did you see that girl talking to
suspicions people in these 6 months

1767
01:57:54,464 --> 01:57:57,923
Sir, Poochiyappan this guys
assistant used to serve us

1768
01:57:58,411 --> 01:58:00,160
She would follow him around

1769
01:58:00,185 --> 01:58:02,352
I warned her not to talk to him

1770
01:58:02,695 --> 01:58:04,695
- poochiyappan
- This guys assistant

1771
01:58:05,515 --> 01:58:07,682
Sir, around 4.30 today

1772
01:58:08,343 --> 01:58:11,802
He was talking something
secretly with that girl

1773
01:58:12,380 --> 01:58:13,449
What were you talking?

1774
01:58:13,474 --> 01:58:15,474
I asked him

1775
01:58:16,210 --> 01:58:19,835
He said he was planning to
blow up the whole train

1776
01:58:20,318 --> 01:58:22,818
He is taking revenge for
not listening to his poems

1777
01:58:23,611 --> 01:58:24,611
Did you?

1778
01:58:24,807 --> 01:58:27,223
I did, but I didn't mean it

1779
01:58:27,224 --> 01:58:30,140
- You said it?
- Yes, Finish me

1780
01:58:31,849 --> 01:58:36,765
Your wife will elope on your
nuptial listening to your poem

1781
01:58:37,349 --> 01:58:43,182
I saw both of them coming down from
the train top around 6-6.30 AM

1782
01:58:43,349 --> 01:58:44,349
From the train roof?

1783
01:58:45,551 --> 01:58:47,926
Sir, Something wrong sir

1784
01:58:50,015 --> 01:58:52,974
- Start it!
- You've given some message around 4.30

1785
01:58:53,515 --> 01:58:55,515
- you saw me then, next

1786
01:58:55,682 --> 01:59:00,640
They were in the rooftop around 5-6 AM and
she has seen them coming down around 6.30AM

1787
01:59:01,845 --> 01:59:04,762
7 AM the train didn't
stop at the Gudur station

1788
01:59:06,139 --> 01:59:09,931
You killed a RPF when crossing Thada
- Who? Me!

1789
01:59:11,390 --> 01:59:15,057
So you've planned it

1790
01:59:15,265 --> 01:59:16,265
You a script writer

1791
01:59:17,536 --> 01:59:18,702
Where is the bomb?

1792
01:59:18,890 --> 01:59:20,307
That's it!

1793
01:59:22,599 --> 01:59:24,682
Thanks for the information
You can go

1794
01:59:29,182 --> 01:59:31,140
Did you call me sir?

1795
01:59:33,432 --> 01:59:34,515
You won't answer me?

1796
01:59:35,015 --> 01:59:37,349
- I can't answer you
- Terrorist Adamancy

1797
01:59:38,147 --> 01:59:40,106
- What next?
- You only know

1798
01:59:44,140 --> 01:59:45,140
Your men?

1799
01:59:46,974 --> 01:59:48,557
- Yes
- Are they armed

1800
01:59:48,582 --> 01:59:49,862
We shall know only if we open it

1801
01:59:50,280 --> 01:59:52,405
Go open it Go!

1802
01:59:54,640 --> 01:59:56,557
Go!
Go open it!

1803
01:59:57,099 --> 01:59:58,807
No one seems to be opening it

1804
01:59:58,905 --> 01:59:59,905
Go open it!

1805
02:00:00,015 --> 02:00:01,682
Why are you hiding sir?

1806
02:00:02,140 --> 02:00:03,640
Vendors, sit down!

1807
02:00:04,724 --> 02:00:06,057
- Open it!
- You can do it!

1808
02:00:07,390 --> 02:00:08,390
Open it!

1809
02:00:11,224 --> 02:00:14,724
Why are you opening it so late?

1810
02:00:16,515 --> 02:00:18,515
Don't know who they were

1811
02:00:19,099 --> 02:00:22,890
- They robbed all our jewellery
- they were all speaking in Hindi

1812
02:00:25,640 --> 02:00:27,974
They opened the pantry
They are enquiring

1813
02:00:31,140 --> 02:00:34,349
- What happened?
- They had robbed everyone, that's why

1814
02:00:34,640 --> 02:00:36,432
Sir, I've recorded it sir

1815
02:00:41,057 --> 02:00:43,057
So the sniper team didn't
shoot at the terrorists

1816
02:00:44,307 --> 02:00:46,307
- So they are robbers
- At least now he found out

1817
02:00:47,474 --> 02:00:51,724
So you, Poochi and that make-up girl are?

1818
02:00:52,640 --> 02:00:54,307
Come to me again

1819
02:00:54,369 --> 02:00:58,202
Sir a new story has opened up
Concentrate on that

1820
02:00:58,432 --> 02:01:00,932
They both are innocent like me

1821
02:01:00,974 --> 02:01:02,349
Don't believe him

1822
02:01:02,913 --> 02:01:03,913
Be serious

1823
02:01:04,557 --> 02:01:07,557
Sir, that girl came to the
pantry searching for him

1824
02:01:07,741 --> 02:01:09,574
They both love each other

1825
02:01:09,676 --> 02:01:12,384
Not knowing that made a terrorist out of me

1826
02:01:12,646 --> 02:01:15,729
He is no terrorist
He is a wasted buffalo running the pantry

1827
02:01:16,572 --> 02:01:17,780
Why did you lie?

1828
02:01:18,025 --> 02:01:20,733
I'm sure that Poochi and
that girl are not terrorists

1829
02:01:20,765 --> 02:01:21,640
But he is one

1830
02:01:21,674 --> 02:01:24,757
Shut up! Sir knows all the truth now

1831
02:01:24,869 --> 02:01:27,161
He is not a fool to believe you anymore

1832
02:01:28,099 --> 02:01:29,931
If you both don't stop your drama
I'll shoot you

1833
02:01:29,932 --> 02:01:33,557
Kill them?

1834
02:01:34,077 --> 02:01:37,452
You are a DTR right?
Be serious

1835
02:01:38,182 --> 02:01:40,890
What are going to do Poochi?
I'm scared

1836
02:01:41,224 --> 02:01:43,265
Don't worry I'm there

1837
02:01:43,682 --> 02:01:46,140
- How are you?
- Who is that?

1838
02:01:46,182 --> 02:01:49,515
We can hear Poochi and that girl

1839
02:01:50,307 --> 02:01:52,307
Hey can you hear me

1840
02:01:52,474 --> 02:01:53,474
Can you hear me?

1841
02:01:53,599 --> 02:01:55,599
Who are you?

1842
02:01:55,640 --> 02:01:57,015
I'm Captain Aravind

1843
02:01:57,369 --> 02:01:59,115
Sir that girl is stuck in the engine

1844
02:01:59,140 --> 02:02:01,099
Why did you go there?
- she is my life

1845
02:02:01,349 --> 02:02:02,640
What?
What do you mean?

1846
02:02:03,265 --> 02:02:04,265
Hello

1847
02:02:06,807 --> 02:02:09,390
She is my girl
Please save her sir!

1848
02:02:17,849 --> 02:02:19,390
Poochi, are you there?

1849
02:02:22,890 --> 02:02:24,557
Sir, Can you hear me

1850
02:02:24,612 --> 02:02:27,029
please speak loudly, can't hear you

1851
02:02:35,330 --> 02:02:37,038
Captain Aravind from DC express

1852
02:02:39,849 --> 02:02:42,182
There were 6 terrorist on
the roof of the train Can

1853
02:02:42,199 --> 02:02:44,407
you give the count of
terrorist inside the train

1854
02:02:44,432 --> 02:02:46,432
None of them are terrorist

1855
02:02:46,944 --> 02:02:47,944
They are all robbers

1856
02:02:48,096 --> 02:02:50,513
Then the girl and that boy

1857
02:02:50,783 --> 02:02:52,490
he is just a vendor

1858
02:02:52,515 --> 02:02:54,166
That girl is a make-up
assistant of a heroine

1859
02:02:54,190 --> 02:02:56,273
They 2 look innocent for now

1860
02:02:56,614 --> 02:02:59,572
No terrorist would pose
themselves to be so

1861
02:03:00,080 --> 02:03:01,574
They would act innocent

1862
02:03:01,599 --> 02:03:02,265
I hope you know that

1863
02:03:02,349 --> 02:03:05,390
And the media is telecasting
them to be terrorists

1864
02:03:05,890 --> 02:03:08,474
I can't declare them not to be
terrorist with what you say

1865
02:03:08,599 --> 02:03:10,974
Do one thing. Make me talk to them

1866
02:03:11,182 --> 02:03:14,599
Only then can I come to a conclusion

1867
02:03:15,012 --> 02:03:16,332
Can you do that?
Is that possible?

1868
02:03:16,360 --> 02:03:17,985
No way sir, It's impossible

1869
02:03:18,010 --> 02:03:20,010
They both only have walkie talkies

1870
02:03:21,724 --> 02:03:24,765
We can talk within a
radius of 7 kms with it

1871
02:03:25,397 --> 02:03:28,106
There is no option for you to
speak to them from Chennai

1872
02:03:28,474 --> 02:03:30,109
Logically it is impossible

1873
02:03:31,057 --> 02:03:32,057
It's possible sir

1874
02:03:32,082 --> 02:03:35,124
- Practically it won't work
- Surely I can make it

1875
02:03:37,135 --> 02:03:38,510
What did he say?

1876
02:03:38,765 --> 02:03:41,265
- The terrorist didn't hijack the train
- Then what's happening

1877
02:03:41,804 --> 02:03:45,054
I told you sir
Something is happening

1878
02:03:47,684 --> 02:03:49,850
You are translating him for me

1879
02:03:51,067 --> 02:03:52,067
Leave!

1880
02:03:57,622 --> 02:03:59,622
What is he doing with a filter?

1881
02:04:33,974 --> 02:04:36,349
Can we get electricity from Wheat dough?

1882
02:04:37,807 --> 02:04:39,182
Poochiyappan, you hear me?

1883
02:04:39,682 --> 02:04:41,682
- Sir, I can hear you
- it's connected

1884
02:04:43,407 --> 02:04:45,407
Now this walkie is connected to a mobile

1885
02:04:45,432 --> 02:04:49,515
Whoever wants to talk can call
this mobile and talk to them

1886
02:04:50,299 --> 02:04:52,549
- Sir, Captain Aravind
- Put him on speaker

1887
02:04:53,452 --> 02:04:54,452
yes captain

1888
02:04:54,479 --> 02:04:56,729
Sir, there walkie talkie has
been connected to our phones

1889
02:04:56,754 --> 02:04:59,254
- Now you can talk to them
- You are already talking only

1890
02:04:59,653 --> 02:05:01,036
I need to talk to that girl

1891
02:05:01,061 --> 02:05:02,821
What do you need to talk to that girl?
- tell

1892
02:05:03,301 --> 02:05:07,259
Nothing should happen to any of the
passengers, What are your demands?

1893
02:05:07,655 --> 02:05:11,149
What's your ransom, the government
is ready to give anything

1894
02:05:11,294 --> 02:05:14,919
I want to become a super singer sir

1895
02:05:15,632 --> 02:05:16,632
You acting?

1896
02:05:16,723 --> 02:05:19,848
I'm not interested in
acting, only singing sir

1897
02:05:20,546 --> 02:05:21,921
Should I believe
you to be a singer

1898
02:05:23,189 --> 02:05:26,731
If you don't believe ask
Singer Mano sir or Chitra maam

1899
02:05:26,756 --> 02:05:29,465
I sang to them when in Mumbai
They judged me

1900
02:05:29,575 --> 02:05:31,283
They know whether I'm a good singer or not

1901
02:05:31,434 --> 02:05:33,392
Ask them to save us

1902
02:05:33,417 --> 02:05:35,042
I told you he is innocent

1903
02:05:35,670 --> 02:05:38,295
I think she is not innocent
She is a fool

1904
02:05:39,419 --> 02:05:44,210
If it took so long to find this
When will you guys come save us

1905
02:05:44,533 --> 02:05:46,037
Do as you wish?

1906
02:05:46,062 --> 02:05:47,927
Why did you call me a fool?

1907
02:05:47,952 --> 02:05:49,952
Not you I was telling them

1908
02:05:51,160 --> 02:05:55,368
Even in this calamity you are so
prudent, would I doubt your intelligence

1909
02:05:55,393 --> 02:05:58,393
They think of me to be a terrorist
Foolish government

1910
02:06:00,368 --> 02:06:02,890
Saroja, what happened to the Loco Pilot

1911
02:06:03,007 --> 02:06:04,007
Pilot?

1912
02:06:04,032 --> 02:06:05,074
Engine Driver?

1913
02:06:05,872 --> 02:06:09,538
There was blood from his nose and mouth
He is dead

1914
02:06:11,340 --> 02:06:12,840
I think so he has..

1915
02:06:14,564 --> 02:06:16,272
So this is no terrorist act

1916
02:06:16,297 --> 02:06:18,824
This is surely a human error

1917
02:06:18,849 --> 02:06:21,599
Some technical malfunction is the reason

1918
02:06:25,774 --> 02:06:29,524
China and Pakistan could be
responsible for this hijack

1919
02:06:29,626 --> 02:06:32,043
They make this look like a 3rd world war

1920
02:06:32,782 --> 02:06:35,001
Call up the media

1921
02:06:35,026 --> 02:06:38,526
Tell it's not a Hijack and some
technical malfunction is the reason

1922
02:06:39,100 --> 02:06:41,642
Tell them shut their broadcast

1923
02:06:44,997 --> 02:06:49,099
The DC express hasn't been hijacked

1924
02:06:49,124 --> 02:06:52,318
It has been confirmed the 6
on the roof top to be robbers

1925
02:06:52,343 --> 02:06:57,260
Poochiyappan is a tea vendor and
that girl is a make-up assistant

1926
02:06:57,686 --> 02:07:02,124
So this train wasn't
hijacked for the minister

1927
02:07:02,149 --> 02:07:03,843
I doubted it sir

1928
02:07:03,911 --> 02:07:06,202
Terrorist would Kidnap
important people only

1929
02:07:06,600 --> 02:07:09,742
I told you he isn't
significan't to be kidnapped

1930
02:07:09,780 --> 02:07:13,266
- This question was not for you
- Close this Box

1931
02:07:20,337 --> 02:07:23,237
Jack, please move away from the panel board

1932
02:07:23,262 --> 02:07:24,762
What's your problem?

1933
02:07:27,173 --> 02:07:29,333
Please tell it quickly

1934
02:07:29,358 --> 02:07:31,858
The bridge in between is very weak sir

1935
02:07:31,883 --> 02:07:34,803
That bridge can hold only if the train
travels at the speed of 30 kms/hour

1936
02:07:34,965 --> 02:07:37,131
But now the train is
approaching 100kms/hour

1937
02:07:37,236 --> 02:07:39,861
At this speed the bridge
will surely collapse

1938
02:07:41,780 --> 02:07:45,155
You know it's old
Why send us through it?

1939
02:07:50,442 --> 02:07:53,858
Go get yourself seated

1940
02:07:54,814 --> 02:07:57,314
What does this mean?
Answer me!

1941
02:07:57,910 --> 02:08:01,660
Shut yourself and go sit down!

1942
02:08:06,478 --> 02:08:08,520
Shout out!
Make your final cries

1943
02:08:09,020 --> 02:08:12,789
While crossing the bridge
Let us all die

1944
02:08:13,173 --> 02:08:14,798
Go away!

1945
02:08:14,944 --> 02:08:16,444
I'm traveling too

1946
02:08:40,424 --> 02:08:42,424
Come soon!

1947
02:08:47,932 --> 02:08:50,031
This bridge can stand only if it
come at a speed of 30kms/hour

1948
02:08:50,055 --> 02:08:53,055
But the train is approaching
at a speed of 120kms/hour

1949
02:08:53,080 --> 02:08:57,538
Will this bridge collapse or not?
We will get to know soon

1950
02:08:58,005 --> 02:09:00,005
Let's go near the bridge

1951
02:09:01,009 --> 02:09:03,009
What kind of people you are

1952
02:09:03,408 --> 02:09:04,983
Don't you have traces of sympathy in you

1953
02:09:05,007 --> 02:09:07,789
There are so many lives at
stake in that train, and you

1954
02:09:07,814 --> 02:09:09,814
are concern is whether the
bridge will break or not

1955
02:09:10,306 --> 02:09:12,306
You are saying all this to increase the TRP

1956
02:09:12,582 --> 02:09:15,248
What if your family was in the train?

1957
02:09:15,291 --> 02:09:16,791
Our jobs is like that

1958
02:09:17,680 --> 02:09:19,263
- You believe in God?
- Yes

1959
02:09:20,027 --> 02:09:22,027
Pray for them
Miracle will happen

1960
02:09:23,739 --> 02:09:25,030
Will the bridge collapse

1961
02:09:25,715 --> 02:09:27,715
This was constructed by the British
It won't

1962
02:09:28,451 --> 02:09:30,451
If it was done by us
It is doubtful

1963
02:09:30,476 --> 02:09:33,556
Can you influence the railway department
from stopping the bridge from collapsing

1964
02:09:33,580 --> 02:09:35,300
I'm the reneweable energy
resources minister

1965
02:09:35,741 --> 02:09:38,866
I don't know anything about my department

1966
02:09:39,631 --> 02:09:41,090
You want me to talk to the railways

1967
02:09:41,251 --> 02:09:43,459
Can't we save Poochi and Saroja

1968
02:09:45,813 --> 02:09:47,224
We escaping is doubtful

1969
02:09:49,364 --> 02:09:54,114
More than the suspense of the
train crossing the bridge

1970
02:09:54,139 --> 02:10:00,273
The Love of Poochi and Saroja
is the talk of the town

1971
02:10:00,298 --> 02:10:07,048
Would this true love win, lets wait This is
Rekha with camera man Aadhi for IBC news

1972
02:10:11,716 --> 02:10:14,292
Poochi, I'm scared

1973
02:10:14,317 --> 02:10:17,317
- I too am coming with you only
- We are going to die

1974
02:10:21,700 --> 02:10:26,116
Saroja, if you do as I say we can
stop the train Can you do it?

1975
02:10:26,233 --> 02:10:27,817
Surely, I will

1976
02:10:27,905 --> 02:10:30,780
Why are you getting your self in trouble
accepting things you don't know

1977
02:10:31,057 --> 02:10:33,057
You shut up!

1978
02:10:33,199 --> 02:10:36,115
Go near the engine cabin
If you open the door

1979
02:10:37,918 --> 02:10:39,918
Saroja, what happened?

1980
02:10:43,256 --> 02:10:45,968
It's hot sir I'm burnt

1981
02:10:45,993 --> 02:10:47,743
The cabin is where the driver is

1982
02:10:48,166 --> 02:10:50,888
There is a green button
near the driver seat

1983
02:10:50,913 --> 02:10:52,913
Right of that, there is
a black lever, that is

1984
02:10:52,938 --> 02:10:55,263
the emergency brake Pull
it to stop the train

1985
02:10:57,942 --> 02:10:59,817
I tried but the door didn't open

1986
02:10:59,842 --> 02:11:03,239
We have 3 minutes,
Break open the engine door some how

1987
02:11:03,403 --> 02:11:05,153
Somehow pull the emergency brake

1988
02:11:05,392 --> 02:11:07,600
You are responsible for 742 peoples life

1989
02:11:09,013 --> 02:11:11,096
I will do it sir
I will finish it

1990
02:11:15,322 --> 02:11:16,489
Fool!
Stop!

1991
02:11:17,270 --> 02:11:19,853
Sir she is a fool
She won't do it

1992
02:11:20,098 --> 02:11:22,348
Poochi she can handle this

1993
02:11:22,876 --> 02:11:24,959
You go, Take care

1994
02:11:26,556 --> 02:11:30,306
Saroja, be careful

1995
02:11:46,819 --> 02:11:48,486
Be careful!
Fool!

1996
02:11:53,689 --> 02:11:55,439
The walkie has fallen

1997
02:12:00,601 --> 02:12:03,310
Hold tight and sit there

1998
02:12:05,674 --> 02:12:08,299
Sit down!
- The bridge is approaching

1999
02:12:12,499 --> 02:12:15,291
- Come quick
- The bridge is approaching

2000
02:12:15,575 --> 02:12:16,908
I understand come

2001
02:12:17,194 --> 02:12:18,486
Come quick!

2002
02:12:22,100 --> 02:12:24,100
Can't I see the bridge

2003
02:12:24,739 --> 02:12:27,989
You could have sat there
Why did you come here?

2004
02:12:28,139 --> 02:12:31,514
I couldn't see you from there
That's why I came here

2005
02:12:39,650 --> 02:12:41,817
Sit down and hold tight

2006
02:12:42,793 --> 02:12:43,793
Sit down

2007

You too hold tight!

2009
02:15:20,923 --> 02:15:23,979
The life that stood
still has come back

2010
02:15:24,004 --> 02:15:27,713
It searched you all over and
brought it back to me

2011
02:15:36,130 --> 02:15:39,338
The life that stood
still has come back

2012
02:15:39,363 --> 02:15:43,750
It searched you all over and
brought it back to me

2013
02:15:43,775 --> 02:15:50,609
A day like this, Should not
come ever again

2014
02:15:51,345 --> 02:15:59,199
Even for a second don't be away
Don't dream of even going ahead of me

2015
02:16:01,001 --> 02:16:07,584
The life that stood still has come back
It has told me to embrace you in joy

2016
02:16:08,705 --> 02:16:15,538
There can't be a greater day

I will hold you tight forever Will protect
you in my eye with abundant laughter

2018
02:17:00,912 --> 02:17:07,746
The souls that are united
Is the companion in this turmoil

2019
02:17:08,131 --> 02:17:15,256
The true love cannot be curtailed
Even the fire cannot repress it

2020
02:17:15,822 --> 02:17:22,739
All that happens is a joy
I will be your soulmate forever

2021
02:17:23,382 --> 02:17:30,340
Its a promise, That when you are next to me
The raging flame feels like a chill breeze

2022
02:17:31,247 --> 02:17:35,067
All together I will
shoulder, All your burden

2023
02:17:35,092 --> 02:17:38,426
This will full fill the
purpose of my life

2024
02:17:57,178 --> 02:17:58,178
What happened?

2025
02:18:02,470 --> 02:18:09,178
In this world filled with bustle
I don't need to wilt

2026
02:18:09,537 --> 02:18:12,912
Life comes just once

2027
02:18:13,498 --> 02:18:16,623
Let's dare to take it

2028
02:18:17,369 --> 02:18:20,869
Let's fill it with

02:18:32,724 --> 02:18:39,557
Even when we depart, We will stay together,
This will be greatest achievement

I will hold you tight forever Will protect

2035
02:19:43,834 --> 02:19:45,376
Breaking news

2036
02:19:45,676 --> 02:19:53,676
3 youngsters tried to get a selfie with the
lovers on this train and had tragic death

2037
02:19:54,569 --> 02:19:57,319
Two of them are dancing
like Romeo and Juliet on it

2038
02:19:57,975 --> 02:20:02,142
A Channel has named it
Love express seeing this

2039
02:20:02,439 --> 02:20:05,481
They are discussing whether
this love would succeed

2040
02:20:07,334 --> 02:20:11,073
3 of them died trying to take a
selfie with those crazy people

2041
02:20:11,098 --> 02:20:13,432
Just imagine the agony of their parents

2042
02:20:13,457 --> 02:20:17,540
The life of youngsters these days
is filled with liquor, fun floric

2043
02:20:17,785 --> 02:20:18,785
It's deplorable

2044
02:20:19,056 --> 02:20:21,683
How would they come up in life

2045
02:20:21,708 --> 02:20:23,042
Rightly said

2046
02:20:23,853 --> 02:20:27,561
A caller is online,
Lets see what he has to say

2047
02:20:28,403 --> 02:20:31,569
- This is Unmai Tv
- This is Alex from Madurai

2048
02:20:32,002 --> 02:20:33,919
Alex, how are you
Who would you like to talk to

2049
02:20:33,981 --> 02:20:35,716
Give it to Tamilselvan sir

2050
02:20:35,741 --> 02:20:36,741
Yes Alex

2051
02:20:37,051 --> 02:20:39,092
Are you the authority to all the youngsters

2052
02:20:39,241 --> 02:20:42,241
From your assumptions you say
the youngsters are naughty

2053
02:20:44,194 --> 02:20:47,066
You can't hear me!
Then how are you answering me

2054
02:20:47,091 --> 02:20:49,637
We are the ones who helped

2055
02:20:49,926 --> 02:20:51,301
What did you do?

2056
02:20:51,437 --> 02:20:55,896
During floods you didn't step out of your
house and posted pictures from your doorstep

2057
02:20:55,921 --> 02:20:58,110
Are you using this to increase the TRP

2058
02:20:58,135 --> 02:21:00,260
We are suffering for electing you

2059
02:21:00,997 --> 02:21:02,789
From now on we'll be on the field

2060
02:21:03,257 --> 02:21:06,466
DO you think politics is Child's Play
Do you know how much we've gone through

2061
02:21:09,916 --> 02:21:13,537
Everytime I turn on the TV you are talking

2062
02:21:13,637 --> 02:21:15,178
Don't you ever go home

2063
02:21:16,637 --> 02:21:19,678
(Verbal abuses)

2064
02:21:20,486 --> 02:21:21,486
I'm scolding you

2065
02:21:21,747 --> 02:21:23,747
You shameless fellow
you will laugh

2066
02:21:24,074 --> 02:21:27,365
Don't cut the call Keep it on!

2067
02:21:32,189 --> 02:21:34,189
Don't just scold him

2068
02:21:34,866 --> 02:21:38,450
Enough for him Alex

2069
02:21:38,760 --> 02:21:43,366
There are 2 others waiting to talk

2070
02:21:43,391 --> 02:21:44,343
The youth power

2071
02:21:44,368 --> 02:21:47,660
Are you gonna use the youth
power to draw current

2072
02:21:47,685 --> 02:21:49,519
Why are you having such a grumpy face?

2073
02:21:49,938 --> 02:21:52,688
Everytime the red shirt
man talks you interupt

2074
02:21:53,739 --> 02:21:56,614
It's rare that he talks sensibly,
Even that you interupt

2075
02:21:56,903 --> 02:21:59,361
You all simply talk mindless nonsense

2076
02:21:59,616 --> 02:22:02,783
You never initiate anything constructive

2077
02:22:02,872 --> 02:22:04,913
And that man is mediating all of this

2078
02:22:05,285 --> 02:22:07,493
Why are you scolding me?
Have some moral ethics

2079
02:22:08,994 --> 02:22:11,601
If you continue doing
this, One of these days

2080
02:22:11,700 --> 02:22:13,825
a fight will erupt and
you will land in jail

2081
02:22:13,885 --> 02:22:15,008
Stop this program where
you create problems

2082
02:22:15,032 --> 02:22:17,406
I'll take care of this

2083
02:22:23,466 --> 02:22:25,966
Viewers, the truth is obvious

2084
02:22:26,275 --> 02:22:29,838
If it was some other channel, they would
have opted for a commercial break

2085
02:22:29,863 --> 02:22:31,321
But our Unmai TV is not like them

2086
02:22:31,686 --> 02:22:34,895
We want to bring out your true feelings

2087
02:22:35,569 --> 02:22:39,653
In recent times, during
our debate session the

2088
02:22:39,678 --> 02:22:43,594
public are exploding
with anger and agression

2089
02:22:45,262 --> 02:22:48,512
Avoiding the several
burning issues outside,

2090
02:22:48,653 --> 02:22:51,528
Just to run a channel

2091
02:22:51,833 --> 02:22:56,958
We create problems and debate on them,
This seems to be the reason

2092
02:22:57,408 --> 02:23:02,741
Moving forward, do we need
such debating forums or not?

2093
02:23:03,174 --> 02:23:06,309
We'll continue to debate on
this after a short break

2094
02:23:06,715 --> 02:23:07,715
- Maya
- Yes Rekha

2095
02:23:08,163 --> 02:23:12,958
We are entering a forest region
We will loose coverage for a while

2096
02:23:13,623 --> 02:23:15,887
Maya can you hear me

2097
02:23:32,931 --> 02:23:35,473
Sir, Aravind sir

2098
02:23:39,298 --> 02:23:41,298
What's your problem?

2099
02:23:42,377 --> 02:23:44,377
I'm gonna kill you both

2100
02:23:44,419 --> 02:23:47,102
Have you gone mad?

2101
02:23:47,127 --> 02:23:49,502
Don't know where this
train is going to topple

2102
02:23:56,607 --> 02:23:58,374
Is this time to take revenge

2103
02:24:04,075 --> 02:24:08,491
If we fight in this stage we
will become a laughing stock

2104
02:24:09,103 --> 02:24:11,547
You are a old school villain

2105
02:24:12,054 --> 02:24:14,971
A tunnel is approaching
Sit down!

2106
02:24:15,429 --> 02:24:18,123
I'll never forget the vengance

2107
02:24:25,216 --> 02:24:26,257
It's time for you to leave

2108
02:24:31,549 --> 02:24:34,591
If the train crashes will
lead to huge casuality

2109
02:24:40,551 --> 02:24:42,259
Sir, an idea!

2110
02:24:42,284 --> 02:24:45,603
How about chasing the train
with a helicopter and lets

2111
02:24:45,628 --> 02:24:48,545
suspend a ladder and land
a mechanic in the engine

2112
02:24:49,060 --> 02:24:51,750
I think you watch too many Hollywood movies

2113
02:24:51,775 --> 02:24:57,233
If we call an ambulance for an emergency,
they would come only for his funeral

2114
02:24:57,845 --> 02:24:59,553
Be Indian Think Indian!

2115
02:24:59,697 --> 02:25:01,739
Sir there is no time sir
This will be the right move

2116
02:25:06,733 --> 02:25:09,150
- Sir!
- I will update myself

2117
02:25:09,322 --> 02:25:11,905
We don't need to get
ideas from the hollywood

2118
02:25:11,930 --> 02:25:14,388
movies, We just need
to use our grey matter

2119
02:25:24,377 --> 02:25:29,752
Poochi! Poochi! A helicopter is
coming to fetch all in this train

2120
02:25:31,297 --> 02:25:32,297
Alright

2121
02:25:36,388 --> 02:25:38,388
Here! This way

2122
02:27:06,276 --> 02:27:09,735
The last effort to rescue this
train ended in a disaster

2123
02:27:11,068 --> 02:27:14,943
The railway mechanic Shankar involved
in this mission faced a tragic death

2124
02:27:16,571 --> 02:27:17,571
You don't cry, wait

2125
02:27:17,596 --> 02:27:19,555
Saroja Saroja, can you hear me?

2126
02:27:21,768 --> 02:27:24,448
Sir, that girl doesn't have a walkie
Only I have one, Please tell me

2127
02:27:24,488 --> 02:27:26,560
See that engine window glass is broken

2128
02:27:26,918 --> 02:27:29,878
Now ask Saroja to break open and go in
Ask her to go in and apply the brake

2129
02:27:30,332 --> 02:27:32,052
Poochi! Ask her to apply
the emergency brake

2130
02:27:32,205 --> 02:27:34,078
We only have 15 minutes before we can
reach the destination Somehow do it

2131
02:27:34,102 --> 02:27:34,685
Okay sir

2132
02:27:34,710 --> 02:27:36,710
Hey!
See that glass is broken

2133
02:27:37,549 --> 02:27:39,751
As they said, go inside
Apply the emergency brake

2134
02:27:39,838 --> 02:27:40,838
Brake

2135
02:27:58,318 --> 02:28:00,318
Which one?

2136
02:28:01,653 --> 02:28:04,695
Green

2137
02:28:08,353 --> 02:28:10,353
He said something after the green

2138
02:28:12,418 --> 02:28:14,418
Black lever

2139
02:28:15,130 --> 02:28:17,130
Which one?
I see two here

2140
02:28:20,065 --> 02:28:23,065
Sir of the two which one should I pull?

2141
02:28:24,710 --> 02:28:26,710
Sorry sir

2142
02:28:26,945 --> 02:28:32,611
(Children rhyme to pick and choose)

2143
02:29:00,031 --> 02:29:01,447
What happens? It didn't stop

2144
02:29:01,999 --> 02:29:04,416
When I touch it, It fumes

2145
02:29:04,691 --> 02:29:06,482
What? It fumes

2146
02:29:07,181 --> 02:29:08,556
What happened Poochi?

2147
02:29:08,658 --> 02:29:10,355
Sir, she says something is fuming

2148
02:29:10,380 --> 02:29:13,310
Sir, what's happening?
Is that all?

2149
02:29:13,643 --> 02:29:15,976
This train won't stop
Is it all over?

2150
02:29:16,391 --> 02:29:18,808
Sir I think all the electronic
devices are short circuited

2151
02:29:18,989 --> 02:29:21,406
All the control boards is damaged

2152
02:29:21,431 --> 02:29:24,173
It's now impossible to technically stop
the train We can't do anything further

2153
02:29:24,197 --> 02:29:26,197
Every thing is finished
Beyond this

2154
02:29:26,549 --> 02:29:29,685
How can you be so irresponsible?
They are all depending on us

2155
02:29:29,710 --> 02:29:32,085
If the train crashes into
the central station all

2156
02:29:32,110 --> 02:29:34,443
the passengers will be
blown to bits Do something

2157
02:29:34,943 --> 02:29:36,025
What do you mean do something?

2158
02:29:36,026 --> 02:29:39,485
What can I do? Can I pull apart the compartment
and the engine and save the passengers?

2159
02:29:41,211 --> 02:29:42,211
Pull apart!

2160
02:29:45,553 --> 02:29:47,239
So if you can pull apart the
engine and compartments you

2161
02:29:47,263 --> 02:29:49,680
can save all the passengers?
- Yes sir - Let's do it

2162
02:29:51,832 --> 02:29:54,109
Even an experienced technician will
find it difficult to remove the

2163
02:29:54,110 --> 02:29:57,568
coupling on the running train At this
juncture how do we do it, with whom?

2164
02:29:57,776 --> 02:29:59,526
That boy Poochi, let's use him

2165
02:29:59,710 --> 02:30:03,987
Good idea - It's a bad idea, He's a small
lad, he can't even lift the coupling

2166
02:30:04,012 --> 02:30:05,192
Then you go do it - Sir,
I am man with a family,

2167
02:30:05,193 --> 02:30:07,782
how can I do coupling? I
can't open the coupling

2168
02:30:07,807 --> 02:30:09,599
Then you shut up
Always creating hindrances

2169
02:30:10,529 --> 02:30:11,571
Poochi Are you there?

2170
02:30:11,744 --> 02:30:14,838
I am hearing everything
Should I not have a family?

2171
02:30:14,863 --> 02:30:16,322
Poochi I understand your emotions

2172
02:30:16,347 --> 02:30:19,027
You are our last resort It's a life
or death situation for all of us

2173
02:30:19,901 --> 02:30:21,598
You have to get down and
remove this coupling

2174
02:30:21,622 --> 02:30:25,081
If you have to save all the passengers
you have to take this risk You can do it

2175
02:30:25,106 --> 02:30:27,378
I will go Good

2176
02:30:27,403 --> 02:30:30,643
Alright how do it get down - Don't Poochi
- Don't worry, we will take care of that

2177
02:30:31,512 --> 02:30:34,085
Sir, we only have 8 minutes
- Sir, exactly six minutes more

2178
02:30:35,054 --> 02:30:36,054
Jack please!

2179
02:30:36,308 --> 02:30:38,628
Even the mechanic was unable to do it
How can a tea vendor do it!

2180
02:30:38,652 --> 02:30:42,341
Bhaskar, it's going to crash here
You clear this area

2181
02:30:53,750 --> 02:30:54,750
No need Poochi

2182
02:30:56,104 --> 02:30:58,104
Listen to me Don't,

2183
02:31:02,302 --> 02:31:03,635
Poochi don't

2184
02:31:07,052 --> 02:31:09,052
Poochi!

2185
02:31:12,310 --> 02:31:14,310
Poochi don't

2186
02:31:23,821 --> 02:31:26,181
Hey! You have to drop me in between
Where are you taking me?

2187
02:31:28,423 --> 02:31:30,423
Hey! It's the fan

2188
02:31:32,353 --> 02:31:35,728
Are you new on the job like me?
Is this the time to practice?

2189
02:32:09,154 --> 02:32:11,154
This is how you killed the other guy

2190
02:32:18,821 --> 02:32:20,112
Careful Your leg

2191
02:32:22,824 --> 02:32:24,824
Hey stop Stop!

2192
02:32:25,325 --> 02:32:27,168
Did we cross the bridge?

2193
02:32:27,989 --> 02:32:28,989
Bring glory to my name!

2194
02:32:30,146 --> 02:32:32,146
Can you just shut up
- Sorry bro!

2195
02:32:38,889 --> 02:32:39,919
Hold tight

2196
02:32:39,944 --> 02:32:40,944
Watch out

2197
02:32:46,790 --> 02:32:48,392
Mr Poochiappan

2198
02:32:48,417 --> 02:32:50,001
Mr Poochiappan

2199
02:32:50,962 --> 02:32:53,212
If you come back alive to Chennai

2200
02:32:54,120 --> 02:32:55,120
What?

2201
02:32:55,156 --> 02:32:57,572
You should give the first
interview to our channel

2202
02:32:57,793 --> 02:33:01,376
Confirmed! You will never change

2203
02:33:02,096 --> 02:33:04,971
You won't progress at all!
- I can't hear

2204
02:33:06,506 --> 02:33:10,297
I know you are saying something good Come
over there and tell us the entire thing

2205
02:33:10,727 --> 02:33:12,727
For sure will come and tell you

2206
02:33:14,019 --> 02:33:17,500
Here the life is oscillating and
these guys want an interview

2207
02:33:17,525 --> 02:33:19,817
Poochi can I ask you one thing?
- What?

2208
02:33:19,916 --> 02:33:23,125
When you are giving the interview
can I stand by your side?

2209
02:33:29,688 --> 02:33:31,688
Without you my dear?

2210
02:33:36,332 --> 02:33:39,252
Sir ask that girl to come to this
compartment and then remove the coupling

2211
02:33:39,326 --> 02:33:41,201
We barely have few minutes
and if he is saving

2212
02:33:41,226 --> 02:33:42,893
that girl this train
will topple and crash

2213
02:33:42,918 --> 02:33:43,918
Then that girl's fate?

2214
02:33:44,677 --> 02:33:47,094
It's alright to sacrifice 1
life for the sake of 744 lives

2215
02:33:47,267 --> 02:33:48,809
Poochi online
- Poochi

2216
02:33:48,834 --> 02:33:51,001
Tell me sir - You are
on the buffer There's a

2217
02:33:51,173 --> 02:33:53,632
coupling informs of you and
you need to remove that

2218
02:33:54,460 --> 02:33:56,001
But my lover is in the engine

2219
02:33:56,191 --> 02:33:58,791
That's not a problem, as you remove
the coupling the pressure will

2220
02:33:58,842 --> 02:34:01,019
release automatically The engine
will go a short distance and stop

2221
02:34:01,043 --> 02:34:02,751
What should I do?

2222
02:34:03,254 --> 02:34:05,047
First remove the U Clamp
- What's the U clamp?

2223
02:34:05,071 --> 02:34:07,071
Like the alphabet U

2224
02:34:07,782 --> 02:34:11,199
You mean the one like the jar handle?
- Exactly

2225
02:34:12,939 --> 02:34:14,939
Public please cooperate

2226
02:34:27,298 --> 02:34:28,673
Okay I have done it

2227
02:34:28,877 --> 02:34:31,044
There's a screw to release
it near the coupling

2228
02:34:32,388 --> 02:34:34,472
The one that looks a machine
to make the noodles?

2229
02:34:34,817 --> 02:34:37,808
Yes, make noodles with it! I mean loosen it

2230
02:34:37,927 --> 02:34:38,927
Okay sir

2231
02:34:41,105 --> 02:34:43,230
Try it Poochi

2232
02:34:43,668 --> 02:34:46,085
Rotate it clockwise

2233
02:34:46,968 --> 02:34:50,884
What do you mean by clockwise?
- The same way a clock rotates

2234
02:34:52,052 --> 02:34:53,470
In the direction of our eating hand?
- Eating hand?

2235
02:34:53,494 --> 02:34:54,953
- He means the right side, he's correct

2236
02:34:54,977 --> 02:34:59,293
Yes! Faster, yes Poochi! Continue rotating!

2237
02:35:00,059 --> 02:35:03,934
Loosen it!

2238
02:35:04,603 --> 02:35:06,020
Continue doing it

2239
02:35:06,209 --> 02:35:07,543
Did it get loose?

2240
02:35:07,894 --> 02:35:09,019
It did

2241
02:35:09,420 --> 02:35:10,710
Then just lift the towing hook

2242
02:35:11,408 --> 02:35:13,034
Sir tell him it's like
the handles on the wok

2243
02:35:13,058 --> 02:35:15,850
Just lift the one that looks
like the handles of the wok!

2244
02:35:20,906 --> 02:35:24,281
Poochi Fast fast
We don't have time

2245
02:35:30,078 --> 02:35:31,953
Lift it well
Hold it tight and lift it

2246
02:35:33,734 --> 02:35:37,400
Quick fast Try it

2247
02:35:40,208 --> 02:35:42,208
That's great try it Pull it hard

2248
02:35:43,107 --> 02:35:44,982
Come on Come on

2249
02:35:48,643 --> 02:35:50,643
You can do it Poochi

2250
02:35:53,489 --> 02:35:56,864
Keep quite
- You can do it Poochi

2251
02:36:03,924 --> 02:36:06,549
They will always give a job to
the person who does not know it

2252
02:36:12,726 --> 02:36:15,684
Should we tell you separately?

2253
02:36:15,709 --> 02:36:17,876
Why are you simply pointing
out the microphone? Get out

2254
02:36:18,088 --> 02:36:19,838
You accept you can't save them?

2255
02:36:30,209 --> 02:36:33,293
Poochi what are you doing?
Try faster

2256
02:36:33,325 --> 02:36:35,408
Hey! It's very tight
Try harder

2257
02:36:37,668 --> 02:36:40,543
The problem is in this route it's on
the upper grade so it will be tight

2258
02:36:40,645 --> 02:36:42,516
The next junction will be on the
lower grade, it will be looser there

2259
02:36:42,540 --> 02:36:45,714
For the lower grade, he should be on the
other side Poochi, shift to the other side

2260
02:36:45,738 --> 02:36:48,572
What?
Remove from the other side

2261
02:37:02,561 --> 02:37:05,019
Poochi bring that girl to your side
- Are you crazy?

2262
02:37:05,114 --> 02:37:07,406
Poochi The last station will
come soon, remove it quickly

2263
02:37:08,845 --> 02:37:11,929
Quick Fast

2264
02:37:13,764 --> 02:37:16,972
- The engine won't stop
She will die!

2265
02:37:17,989 --> 02:37:21,406
She is my life

2266
02:37:25,567 --> 02:37:27,150
I told you they will unite

2267
02:37:27,481 --> 02:37:29,898
Hold my hand
- Why did he jump there?

2268
02:37:30,799 --> 02:37:32,716
His life is in the engine,
why will he be here?

2269
02:37:33,496 --> 02:37:36,538
Only those who were in love
will understand about it

2270
02:37:37,609 --> 02:37:39,650
This is why we don't include
you in anything - Sorry

2271
02:37:41,015 --> 02:37:44,681
Only love has the power to save
the world and sacrifice oneself

2272
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:49,416
Only we have the power to damage
the world and destroy lives

2273
02:38:02,532 --> 02:38:05,990
Why did you come here?
Do you want to die with me?

2274
02:38:06,335 --> 02:38:08,668
Should we fall in love only to live?

2275
02:38:21,266 --> 02:38:23,682
Only now I have the desire to live

2276
02:38:27,122 --> 02:38:29,122
We can't stop this train?

2277
02:38:30,209 --> 02:38:31,209
Why can't we?

2278
02:38:31,601 --> 02:38:35,434
You change me to a Spider-Man or a super
man I can drag the train and stop it

2279
02:38:38,914 --> 02:38:40,501
I had several dreams

2280
02:38:41,296 --> 02:38:43,296
To become a singer

2281
02:38:43,860 --> 02:38:45,568
To get married to you

2282
02:38:46,293 --> 02:38:49,084
Look at me

2283
02:38:49,109 --> 02:38:51,669
Those who fall in love, will be
lovers only till they get married

2284
02:38:52,371 --> 02:38:54,505
After marriage they will become husband
and wife Will have children and

2285
02:38:54,529 --> 02:38:58,560
then will become grand parents and
finally Depart one after the other

2286
02:38:58,585 --> 02:39:00,585
They would have lost their
love long before that

2287
02:39:01,418 --> 02:39:04,735
Look at us We are lovers now
and till death we are lovers

2288
02:39:06,555 --> 02:39:09,971
How many of them will get such a chance? You
should be privileged to have this moment

2289
02:39:18,370 --> 02:39:20,090
, he said the engine will halt in sometime!

2290
02:39:20,162 --> 02:39:21,662
- It won't stop sir What?

2291
02:39:22,054 --> 02:39:23,054
We lost them

2292
02:39:24,057 --> 02:39:27,016
Why some technical error?
- Human error

2293
02:39:29,411 --> 02:39:31,994
- You have no desires for yourself?
- Who said so?

2294
02:39:33,610 --> 02:39:35,943
I want these track to continue longer

2295
02:39:37,947 --> 02:39:40,364
I wish that you hold me
tight like this longer

2296
02:39:41,705 --> 02:39:43,789
I wish this train continues
running without stopping

2297
02:39:45,799 --> 02:39:46,799
Not for long

2298
02:39:47,808 --> 02:39:49,808
Just for 500 to 1000 years. That's it

2299
02:39:59,002 --> 02:40:02,585
Why are you crying?
- We are going to die, what else can I do

2300
02:40:03,251 --> 02:40:05,251
If you cry, we won't die?

2301
02:40:06,088 --> 02:40:11,380
Look, others should mourn our death, we
should not mourn our death! Understand

2302
02:40:29,827 --> 02:40:31,827
Now I will die happily

2303
02:40:32,438 --> 02:40:33,729
Shall I sing?

2304
02:40:37,133 --> 02:40:38,716
I wanted to die happily

2305
02:40:39,674 --> 02:40:42,674
No when you sing it's pure happiness
Sing

2306
02:42:03,193 --> 02:42:05,450
Hey come fast!

2307
02:42:16,570 --> 02:42:20,486
Saroja! Saroja! Look at me

2308
02:42:42,327 --> 02:42:44,585
It's bleeding, near your ears
See if you are hurt

2309
02:42:45,085 --> 02:42:49,440
It's bleeding, near your ears

2310
02:42:49,465 --> 02:42:52,518
No, it's because you sang close to my ear

2311
02:42:52,543 --> 02:42:55,743
See the government did not know that your
singing has the power to stop anything!

2312
02:42:56,235 --> 02:42:57,235
Get up!

2313
02:42:57,969 --> 02:42:58,969
Poochiappan Sir

2314
02:43:00,563 --> 02:43:06,121
You said you will give us the
first interview after this rescue

2315
02:43:06,146 --> 02:43:07,854
How could have saved
so many people?

2316
02:43:07,950 --> 02:43:11,894
You didn't think about the risk you
were taking? How could you do it?

2317
02:43:15,478 --> 02:43:16,478
It's for my love

2318
02:43:17,639 --> 02:43:19,389
Saroja you are very lucky

2319
02:43:19,498 --> 02:43:22,898
Poochiappan, You will definitely receive the
highest honour for bravery in the country

2320
02:43:23,810 --> 02:43:25,810
Are you expecting something more?

2321
02:43:26,586 --> 02:43:28,586
No I have no such expectations

2322
02:43:29,756 --> 02:43:31,718
My love, she wants to sing

2323
02:43:31,743 --> 02:43:34,993
I am sure several music directors and
movie directors will be seeing it

2324
02:43:35,747 --> 02:43:39,914
If they can give her a
chance it will be great

2325
02:43:39,939 --> 02:43:42,897
Madam, you sing well?
Then you should sing a song for us

2326
02:43:42,922 --> 02:43:46,006
No please. Only now we
have come to a good end

2327
02:43:48,047 --> 02:43:51,589
You will be drained
- It's okay, you should sing later

2328
02:44:02,225 --> 02:44:05,975
Poochiappan please one selfie
- With me?

2329
02:44:06,383 --> 02:44:08,341
You also come madam

2330
02:44:08,992 --> 02:44:11,742
You wanted to take a selfie with me

2331
02:44:12,464 --> 02:44:14,464
Now everyone wants a selfie with you!

2332
02:44:16,434 --> 02:44:18,067
He proved that he's my student

2333
02:44:18,118 --> 02:44:20,951
Just cut the crap!
- He's telling you - I am telling you

2334
02:44:22,300 --> 02:44:25,676
You somehow found that I
was in the military hotel!

2335
02:44:25,701 --> 02:44:27,926
You worked at the military hotel?

2336
02:44:28,061 --> 02:44:31,478
This guy worked in a military hotel

2337
02:44:31,503 --> 02:44:33,503
Did I blabber?
