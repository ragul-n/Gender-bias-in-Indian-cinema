1
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,970
I've been waiting
with my arms outstretched

2
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,790
lo! My prayers are answered

3
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,771
i've got my wish

4
00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:11,433
this prayer of yours
shall not be answered

5
00:03:12,242 --> 00:03:15,661
every thing happens in its own pace
and place. And right now,

6
00:03:16,471 --> 00:03:20,853
i have to fix this house,
else, there'll be a disaster

7
00:03:33,552 --> 00:03:35,278
get down.
- What are you doing?

8
00:03:35,474 --> 00:03:36,403
Please

9
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,130
marry me

10
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:51,431
why?
- You will belong to me

11
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:54,821
i belong to you.
- For ever, i mean

12
00:03:56,398 --> 00:03:58,288
scared that i may stray?

13
00:03:59,348 --> 00:04:02,384
Yes.
- And you feel that social practice...

14
00:04:02,745 --> 00:04:04,634
is stronger than my will?

15
00:04:05,564 --> 00:04:08,864
Zeenat, my strong lady love,
you can consider it...

16
00:04:09,538 --> 00:04:14,629
my weakness, or apprehensiveness.
In fact, i'm tired of this hide-n-seek

17
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:17,930
i know that i was scared
of the world, not you

18
00:04:18,637 --> 00:04:21,575
but i've had enough.
I'm going to saudi tomorrow

19
00:04:24,277 --> 00:04:25,522
marry me

20
00:04:43,536 --> 00:04:45,393
now? Right here?

21
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,582
Right time, right place

22
00:05:19,776 --> 00:05:22,399
hear ye all

23
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:25,247
the emperor is coming

24
00:05:53,744 --> 00:05:56,978
after he's gone,
you will also go with us to the temple

25
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,571
it's beautiful.
- I will, uncle

26
00:06:06,114 --> 00:06:08,506
may the goddess protect you
on your journey

27
00:06:10,215 --> 00:06:12,488
where's my yoghurt shake?
Do i ever get it without asking?

28
00:06:14,253 --> 00:06:15,749
I'll get it

29
00:06:16,367 --> 00:06:19,088
don't spoil her!
Henpecked husband

30
00:06:36,074 --> 00:06:37,964
i'll miss you a lot

31
00:06:40,784 --> 00:06:42,696
only a matter of few months

32
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:48,401
come back soon.
- Before i get over the memories?

33
00:06:50,718 --> 00:06:52,609
These are unforgettable memories

34
00:07:10,171 --> 00:07:13,820
i, amir khan, wish to marry you,
zeenat fatima

35
00:07:15,938 --> 00:07:17,599
in mehr, i give you these earrings...

36
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:21,286
and my heart

37
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:25,323
i, zeenat fatima, approve of you

38
00:07:25,936 --> 00:07:29,967
in mehr, i accept your earrings,
your heart,

39
00:07:31,543 --> 00:07:33,650
your life and soul

40
00:07:34,427 --> 00:07:36,699
my life, my soul

41
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,130
don't weep. Don't make my journey
more difficult

42
00:08:05,767 --> 00:08:09,415
i'm in pain, it's my choice

43
00:08:13,457 --> 00:08:15,249
do you know what i prayed for?

44
00:08:16,212 --> 00:08:18,004
May this sun never set,

45
00:08:18,295 --> 00:08:20,186
may this day never end

46
00:08:21,885 --> 00:08:23,927
true. How do you know?

47
00:08:24,993 --> 00:08:26,819
I can read your mind

48
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:31,690
really?

49
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:35,435
What am i thinking of now?

50
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:41,237
Not here

51
00:10:20,223 --> 00:10:23,709
at least write once a month.
Make our village proud

52
00:10:24,005 --> 00:10:25,698
bring glory to our country.
- I will, father

53
00:10:26,055 --> 00:10:28,425
my respects.
- Bless you

54
00:10:31,183 --> 00:10:33,324
take care of yourself.
- And do write

55
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:34,996
sure

56
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:40,250
and the money you will send,
don't send it by post

57
00:10:40,732 --> 00:10:42,873
and eat well.
- I will

58
00:10:49,384 --> 00:10:52,705
it contains food. Careful

59
00:11:06,496 --> 00:11:08,986
would you leave without
accepting our farewell, son?

60
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,802
You leave me with no choice

61
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,908
you should've at least asked us
before marrying, amir

62
00:11:16,941 --> 00:11:19,760
in getting your approval,
i lost two years, mother

63
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:24,913
come here

64
00:11:28,445 --> 00:11:29,724
salaam aleikom

65
00:11:31,361 --> 00:11:34,015
father, mother... this is zeenat

66
00:11:34,534 --> 00:11:35,746
your daughter-in-law

67
00:11:36,424 --> 00:11:38,337
you can accept this fact,

68
00:11:38,988 --> 00:11:40,878
you can even hate it

69
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:45,039
as you know, she'll accept
any of your choices

70
00:11:45,397 --> 00:11:46,381
we know

71
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:49,937
then let's hear your decision.
- What's this hurry about?

72
00:11:50,268 --> 00:11:53,174
Father, it's simple. Yes, or no

73
00:12:00,169 --> 00:12:03,621
that's it. You'll hear of me
only when i return

74
00:12:04,944 --> 00:12:06,834
only zeenat will get my letters
and phonecalls

75
00:12:07,316 --> 00:12:10,998
don't be so unsympathetic, son.
- Mother, have you ever realised...

76
00:12:11,352 --> 00:12:14,007
how harsh you've been with me?

77
00:12:21,606 --> 00:12:23,202
Take care of yourself

78
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,416
write as soon as you reach

79
00:13:21,785 --> 00:13:26,461
my last tears. I won't shed a tear
until you return

80
00:13:35,885 --> 00:13:39,304
i used to wonder
why god created you

81
00:13:40,467 --> 00:13:43,635
but now i just thank him
everytime i breathe

82
00:13:45,305 --> 00:13:48,540
o my poet, do write those words again
in your letters

83
00:14:02,096 --> 00:14:04,620
lmagine me in it

84
00:14:05,365 --> 00:14:07,407
will you take care of me?

85
00:15:09,454 --> 00:15:10,918
Welcome

86
00:15:16,599 --> 00:15:18,260
got the sim card?

87
00:15:30,442 --> 00:15:31,372
Hello?

88
00:15:33,614 --> 00:15:34,149
Hello?

89
00:15:34,384 --> 00:15:36,526
Turn this way,
or, you'll lose the network

90
00:15:36,787 --> 00:15:39,345
hello?
- All right

91
00:15:40,952 --> 00:15:43,323
hello?
- Hello, my love

92
00:15:49,765 --> 00:15:52,518
how are you?
- First-class. And you?

93
00:15:53,802 --> 00:15:55,211
I'm fine

94
00:15:56,302 --> 00:16:00,498
i hope you are eating well?
- Will you ask me every month?

95
00:16:02,615 --> 00:16:04,888
I just want to hear your voice

96
00:16:06,844 --> 00:16:10,679
the voice of my freedom.
- What then happens of me?

97
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:15,422
I'm stuck between the earth and
the sun. You must feel the same

98
00:16:15,913 --> 00:16:17,803
but please, go on speaking

99
00:16:18,605 --> 00:16:20,036
time up

100
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:23,503
take my name

101
00:16:25,463 --> 00:16:26,959
is he coming towards you?

102
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:28,313
Yes

103
00:16:29,307 --> 00:16:32,313
my name!
- Meera

104
00:16:35,076 --> 00:16:38,463
thanks. I'll call you next month

105
00:16:38,922 --> 00:16:40,418
take care of yourself

106
00:16:42,766 --> 00:16:45,619
you still had ten seconds...
to say a few more things

107
00:16:47,317 --> 00:16:49,841
do drop in. Else, my business
will be ruined

108
00:16:53,501 --> 00:16:55,227
how many months more?

109
00:16:56,801 --> 00:16:58,559
About four months

110
00:17:00,711 --> 00:17:01,639
letter

111
00:17:07,472 --> 00:17:10,606
in few months, we'll get possession
of the mansion of our ancestors

112
00:17:11,316 --> 00:17:13,010
our honour will also be restored

113
00:17:13,592 --> 00:17:15,864
i had let it out
with a heavy heart

114
00:17:17,373 --> 00:17:21,603
a man's honour is seriously attached
to his family and house

115
00:17:22,886 --> 00:17:26,021
and the happiness that is
around us today, is thanks to you

116
00:17:29,198 --> 00:17:31,984
what have i done?
It's your son who is earning

117
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:33,320
my son!

118
00:17:34,292 --> 00:17:36,237
In the last 5 years
we couldn't repay...

119
00:17:36,728 --> 00:17:39,449
what he has repaid
in just six months

120
00:17:40,382 --> 00:17:43,321
true. But, it's thanks to
the goddess of wealth

121
00:17:44,836 --> 00:17:46,748
before marriage, your darling son
was a wastrel

122
00:17:58,358 --> 00:18:00,149
waleikom.
- Assalam

123
00:18:03,742 --> 00:18:04,670
mother,

124
00:18:06,017 --> 00:18:07,709
why don't you employ someone?

125
00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:10,398
I have told you several times

126
00:18:11,816 --> 00:18:13,991
old bones need some help

127
00:18:15,951 --> 00:18:20,299
i can't believe how we made a mistake
in recognising you

128
00:18:21,397 --> 00:18:24,664
never mind, father. Even i thought
the two of you were quite touchy,

129
00:18:24,987 --> 00:18:28,733
miserly, obstinate and high-handed

130
00:18:30,947 --> 00:18:34,498
why don't you keep some money?
- My salary is enough for me

131
00:18:35,177 --> 00:18:37,602
you know that you
also have a right to it

132
00:18:38,093 --> 00:18:40,037
yes. But i'm not in need

133
00:18:40,593 --> 00:18:42,897
goodbye. God be with you.
- God be with you too

134
00:18:48,187 --> 00:18:50,077
that will be mine and shankar's room

135
00:18:51,167 --> 00:18:53,854
whose room will that one be?
- Raj

136
00:18:55,108 --> 00:18:56,769
and that one will be
my mother-in-law's

137
00:18:57,479 --> 00:18:59,687
and this one?
- For you

138
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,913
"my beautiful..."

139
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:08,042
"sweetheart,"

140
00:19:09,752 --> 00:19:13,532
"come to me"

141
00:19:16,995 --> 00:19:18,655
"welcome..."

142
00:19:19,012 --> 00:19:22,181
"to my land"

143
00:20:41,367 --> 00:20:45,334
your name is not here.
I'm surprised too

144
00:20:47,423 --> 00:20:49,313
brother hasn't ever been careless

145
00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:00,555
i'll pay you next month.
Do you trust me?

146
00:21:01,298 --> 00:21:03,637
I do trust...
- then?

147
00:21:04,086 --> 00:21:05,943
Just one minute

148
00:21:06,713 --> 00:21:07,991
all right

149
00:21:09,149 --> 00:21:10,011
here

150
00:21:20,332 --> 00:21:21,261
hello?

151
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,494
I'm meera here

152
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,707
can i speak to shankar singh?

153
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,648
It's mine

154
00:22:31,406 --> 00:22:32,334
amir?

155
00:22:33,136 --> 00:22:34,699
Who's speaking?

156
00:22:36,949 --> 00:22:37,877
Yes

157
00:22:41,019 --> 00:22:42,483
it's okay, tell me

158
00:22:47,748 --> 00:22:48,765
okay

159
00:23:31,905 --> 00:23:34,844
amir has been arrested
on charges of murder

160
00:23:35,879 --> 00:23:38,249
he's been given the capital punishment

161
00:24:42,016 --> 00:24:45,283
i think we must consult akbar

162
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:49,800
holy priest, show us a way out

163
00:24:51,342 --> 00:24:54,029
trust allah.
You must visit a mosque...

164
00:24:54,515 --> 00:24:56,405
and make an offering

165
00:25:15,824 --> 00:25:18,064
are you amir khan's father?
- Yes

166
00:25:18,612 --> 00:25:21,933
i'm natarajan, i come from the
ministry of external affairs, delhi

167
00:25:22,553 --> 00:25:24,792
even we have no clue

168
00:25:25,245 --> 00:25:30,271
all we know is that amir and
his roommate shankar had a brawl

169
00:25:30,724 --> 00:25:33,479
shankar fell from the balcony.
Perhaps amir pushed him

170
00:25:34,185 --> 00:25:37,288
they lived on the tenth floor.
- Amir had told me about shankar

171
00:25:37,773 --> 00:25:40,363
they got along very well.
- Correct

172
00:25:41,107 --> 00:25:44,460
their neighbours too confirm that.
- Then this is certainly an accident

173
00:25:44,824 --> 00:25:48,856
i too feel the same. I somehow managed
to have a word with amir last week

174
00:25:49,855 --> 00:25:53,438
he too said the same.
- We can have him released, can't we?

175
00:25:53,797 --> 00:25:55,654
Please tell the police,
he is innocent...

176
00:25:56,104 --> 00:26:00,135
not that easy. There's no witness

177
00:26:00,494 --> 00:26:02,121
we just have amir's statement

178
00:26:03,089 --> 00:26:06,575
amir is a trucker, and...
- his life is not worth a deal, right?

179
00:26:07,224 --> 00:26:10,423
Ma'am, such news is normally
given by the local police

180
00:26:11,037 --> 00:26:13,341
but, i have personally come here,
on leave

181
00:26:15,521 --> 00:26:18,373
thank you for
the trouble you've taken

182
00:26:19,944 --> 00:26:21,441
can i talk to amir?

183
00:26:22,251 --> 00:26:24,164
We don't even know
where he is being held

184
00:26:27,282 --> 00:26:29,008
the punishment will be carried out
in two months

185
00:26:29,302 --> 00:26:30,765
in two months?

186
00:26:36,288 --> 00:26:39,258
Look, i don't intend
to enliven your hopes

187
00:26:40,132 --> 00:26:43,934
but perhaps, there is a way

188
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:51,148
as per saudi law. If the widow
forgives her husband's killer...

189
00:26:55,994 --> 00:26:59,796
if shankar's wife signs
amir's mercy petition...

190
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,448
amir can be saved

191
00:27:07,945 --> 00:27:11,050
thank god. We'll send
these documents at once

192
00:27:11,407 --> 00:27:14,761
the problem is, we have no idea
where she lives

193
00:27:15,349 --> 00:27:19,610
shankar was from rajasthan, but
the address in his passport is fake

194
00:27:20,155 --> 00:27:24,352
this practice is quite common. We are
investigating, but it'll take time

195
00:27:24,705 --> 00:27:26,814
our government is discussing it
with the saudi government

196
00:27:27,302 --> 00:27:30,569
will take time?
I don't understand this

197
00:27:31,018 --> 00:27:33,925
you are well-versed with the law.
Is there really no way out?

198
00:27:34,223 --> 00:27:38,319
Rajasthan is a huge state.
Our men are trying...

199
00:27:39,383 --> 00:27:42,802
there's no problem.
- She has to be found somehow...

200
00:27:43,131 --> 00:27:44,825
we just need her signature

201
00:27:52,166 --> 00:27:53,151
where to?

202
00:27:56,108 --> 00:27:58,479
To find that woman.
- How?

203
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:02,831
No idea. I know that she lives
in rajasthan

204
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:04,883
how will you go there?

205
00:28:06,524 --> 00:28:07,451
No idea

206
00:28:08,157 --> 00:28:10,331
you are so full of confidence...

207
00:28:11,138 --> 00:28:12,799
yet you know so little

208
00:28:22,609 --> 00:28:25,713
all i know is that he will help me

209
00:28:27,191 --> 00:28:30,972
my dear, all the time, we can't leave
every thing to him

210
00:28:31,582 --> 00:28:34,749
that's why i'm going myself.
- But where will you look for her?

211
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:39,172
I got a picture of amir with shankar

212
00:28:41,804 --> 00:28:44,108
rajasthan is a huge city

213
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:47,118
will you go knocking doors?

214
00:28:47,412 --> 00:28:49,268
I can't sit twiddling my thumbs

215
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:50,707
all right

216
00:28:51,898 --> 00:28:54,268
any other information about her?

217
00:28:57,634 --> 00:29:00,835
And i'm certain
you want to leave right now

218
00:29:01,478 --> 00:29:02,408
right

219
00:29:04,267 --> 00:29:07,468
i wonder what god was thinking
when he created you

220
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:10,899
amir too used to say that

221
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,702
all the buses must've left by now

222
00:29:17,469 --> 00:29:19,359
can't you wait till tomorrow?

223
00:29:20,352 --> 00:29:24,003
If i wait even a moment, i'll feel
as if i'm driving amir towards death

224
00:29:26,505 --> 00:29:29,445
i won't return without her signature,
baig saheb

225
00:29:32,177 --> 00:29:33,106
all right

226
00:29:34,228 --> 00:29:35,211
come on

227
00:29:51,949 --> 00:29:54,538
greetings, binder

228
00:29:54,897 --> 00:29:58,547
salaam aleikom, baig saheb.
After years! How've you been?

229
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:03,706
God has been merciful. What about you?
- I'm first-class. Who's that?

230
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:05,686
Zeenat

231
00:30:06,176 --> 00:30:08,088
god! The little one?

232
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,397
I'm grownup now

233
00:30:14,316 --> 00:30:17,582
binder, i got some work for you

234
00:30:18,322 --> 00:30:21,642
sure. After a meal

235
00:30:22,166 --> 00:30:24,209
let's have mutton pilav

236
00:30:35,273 --> 00:30:39,020
baig saheb, this is madness,
you know

237
00:30:40,302 --> 00:30:42,444
she is crazy too

238
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:47,988
if anyone can pull it off, it's her

239
00:33:50,741 --> 00:33:54,456
i can't go ahead with you,
i got to deliver the stuff

240
00:33:55,739 --> 00:33:57,685
thank you for all your help

241
00:33:58,175 --> 00:34:01,213
don't worry, dear. Good willing,
you will find the girl

242
00:34:01,892 --> 00:34:04,450
i will find her out.
- I'm confident

243
00:34:04,969 --> 00:34:07,723
god be with you, dear.
Farewell

244
00:34:08,173 --> 00:34:09,103
bye

245
00:34:33,617 --> 00:34:35,179
we've run out of opium

246
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:40,757
gauri, give her some money.
- I don't have

247
00:34:43,166 --> 00:34:44,629
we don't have few cents?

248
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:48,602
Shall i ask next month's rent
in advance from mr chopra?

249
00:34:49,125 --> 00:34:52,359
No need. No need to beg

250
00:34:54,701 --> 00:34:57,160
my son wouldn't have left
your wallet empty

251
00:34:59,507 --> 00:35:00,436
never

252
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:05,745
had we not sent him abroad for
a few bucks, we wouldn't have had...

253
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:07,831
to see this day

254
00:35:40,845 --> 00:35:44,199
i'm an astrologer.
- It shows. Go away

255
00:35:44,722 --> 00:35:47,760
if i predict about what you seek,
can i sit here then?

256
00:35:48,152 --> 00:35:50,063
I don't have money to offer you

257
00:35:50,553 --> 00:35:52,279
you can share the food

258
00:35:55,393 --> 00:35:56,802
okay. Tell me

259
00:36:05,807 --> 00:36:09,292
you have set out on a quest.
You are looking for something

260
00:36:10,166 --> 00:36:12,056
every person is looking for something

261
00:36:13,081 --> 00:36:14,939
you are looking for...

262
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,043
a woman

263
00:36:20,355 --> 00:36:21,437
tell me more

264
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:27,360
you've travelled very far,
tired and weary...

265
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:30,988
in a huge vehicle, maybe a truck

266
00:36:38,685 --> 00:36:39,613
thanks

267
00:36:47,145 --> 00:36:48,073
my future?

268
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:49,579
One minute

269
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:56,082
you saw me getting off
sardar's truck, didn't you?

270
00:36:58,681 --> 00:37:00,625
Do you always get away
with this farce?

271
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:03,358
Sometimes

272
00:37:07,395 --> 00:37:09,603
actually, i'm a an actor

273
00:37:10,503 --> 00:37:11,433
what?

274
00:37:12,683 --> 00:37:17,776
Actor. Our clan moves about places
in disguise...

275
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:21,780
conning people, right?
- No. We entertain people

276
00:37:22,681 --> 00:37:25,270
but you can't act for nuts.
- What are you saying, ma'am?

277
00:37:25,693 --> 00:37:31,485
There's no actor like me.
I can do anything you want, try me out

278
00:37:31,845 --> 00:37:35,723
folks, aunt has approved of me,
basanti is willing to marry me...

279
00:37:35,723 --> 00:37:37,613
so i'm not dying!

280
00:37:38,927 --> 00:37:42,761
This earth is my mother, sir.
And he just abused my mother

281
00:37:43,125 --> 00:37:46,228
dates and dates, your honour!

282
00:37:46,778 --> 00:37:49,947
When my arm does the job,

283
00:37:50,431 --> 00:37:53,752
the victim just dies

284
00:37:54,277 --> 00:37:56,800
circuit, do you know
we have 206 bones...

285
00:37:57,288 --> 00:38:00,490
in our body. Do we ever think of it
when we smash them?

286
00:38:01,005 --> 00:38:05,289
Look, it's raining

287
00:38:05,813 --> 00:38:10,576
without my beloved,
my heart is hysteric

288
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:16,472
give me a glimpse!
Come to me, at least once

289
00:38:17,124 --> 00:38:18,653
hats off to you. Great actor

290
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:20,735
thank you. Bye

291
00:38:21,194 --> 00:38:22,624
to con someone else?

292
00:38:23,726 --> 00:38:26,250
Thank you for the food.
God willing, we'll meet again

293
00:38:43,015 --> 00:38:44,905
good god! My bag!

294
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:53,556
I'm sorry, i just dozed off.
I'll just get...

295
00:41:04,201 --> 00:41:09,391
it happened to me too
when dharamveer's father passed away

296
00:41:11,893 --> 00:41:16,536
a living person is turned into
a lifeless, weak puppet

297
00:41:20,928 --> 00:41:23,070
my own son treated me
like a stranger

298
00:41:25,864 --> 00:41:28,803
why were you always so harsh
with me, grandma?

299
00:41:34,387 --> 00:41:36,112
I was envious, dear...

300
00:41:37,271 --> 00:41:39,663
of my life
that never was amiable

301
00:41:41,149 --> 00:41:43,256
your and shankar's love
would upset me

302
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:48,899
strangely, even women
don't care for each other

303
00:41:50,763 --> 00:41:52,620
what can you expect from men then?

304
00:41:56,434 --> 00:41:58,225
Forgive me, my child

305
00:42:14,795 --> 00:42:17,701
for the first time
you have touch me, grandma

306
00:42:20,468 --> 00:42:22,356
and for the first time,

307
00:42:26,811 --> 00:42:28,919
i'm missing shankar so badly

308
00:42:29,246 --> 00:42:31,136
everyone is missing him, dear

309
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:34,690
why is everyone blaming me?

310
00:42:36,072 --> 00:42:37,732
I'm not at fault

311
00:42:38,316 --> 00:42:39,811
i know, dear

312
00:42:41,488 --> 00:42:42,568
i know

313
00:42:54,689 --> 00:42:59,137
it must be difficult for you to see
someone else staying in your house

314
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:02,188
you have no idea...

315
00:43:03,246 --> 00:43:05,967
how close i was. So close

316
00:43:07,572 --> 00:43:09,844
the mansion would've been mine
in just few days

317
00:43:11,417 --> 00:43:14,552
but shankar had to die then

318
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,066
i lost everything that day, mr chopra

319
00:43:21,767 --> 00:43:24,771
my son, my mansion,

320
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:27,629
my honour

321
00:43:28,497 --> 00:43:32,594
i've told you several times
to turn the mansion into a hotel

322
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:35,342
does anyone sell his honour,
his integrity?

323
00:43:37,149 --> 00:43:40,381
I'm just letting the mansion to you
for a few days

324
00:43:41,955 --> 00:43:45,025
one day, i shall take
this mansion back

325
00:43:47,274 --> 00:43:48,967
god willing, it will be

326
00:43:50,287 --> 00:43:51,849
i'll leave now

327
00:43:54,901 --> 00:43:55,829
bye

328
00:45:04,564 --> 00:45:06,028
may i help you?

329
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:12,278
No need

330
00:45:12,607 --> 00:45:16,606
you look new around here. This place
can be dangerous for strangers

331
00:45:17,703 --> 00:45:20,227
i'll be careful. Thanks

332
00:45:32,572 --> 00:45:35,838
now that you are here,
we certainly need to play host

333
00:46:21,822 --> 00:46:23,712
why did you escape
from the police station?

334
00:46:25,187 --> 00:46:27,077
Thanks for finding her

335
00:46:27,784 --> 00:46:29,575
i've been looking for her

336
00:46:29,994 --> 00:46:31,884
she escaped from
jolapur police station

337
00:46:32,686 --> 00:46:36,204
but jolapur police station
is 20 kilometres away

338
00:46:37,171 --> 00:46:39,762
girls are quite fast these days

339
00:46:40,055 --> 00:46:41,946
you are too young
to be an inspector

340
00:46:57,136 --> 00:46:59,441
where do i explain? Here?
Or at the police station?

341
00:47:01,494 --> 00:47:02,640
Here

342
00:47:04,602 --> 00:47:09,879
scoot. Or, i'll haul you and
your stooge in for five years

343
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:21,992
never seen him before.
- Did you see his moustache?

344
00:47:45,201 --> 00:47:47,857
Amir... your husband?

345
00:47:48,792 --> 00:47:49,720
Yes

346
00:47:51,931 --> 00:47:53,756
and you are out looking for him?

347
00:47:56,129 --> 00:47:58,686
Those documents... mercy petition?

348
00:48:00,007 --> 00:48:01,633
Can you read?

349
00:48:05,486 --> 00:48:07,146
Is he in trouble?

350
00:48:10,068 --> 00:48:11,793
What's the charge?

351
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,221
What?
- Perhaps i can help, if you tell me

352
00:48:15,675 --> 00:48:18,013
do i trust a thief who
ran away with my belongings?

353
00:48:19,522 --> 00:48:21,411
I'm a thief, but i didn't run away

354
00:48:21,733 --> 00:48:23,491
i returned every penny

355
00:48:26,955 --> 00:48:28,811
i was wrong, forgive me

356
00:48:29,807 --> 00:48:33,129
i just want to help you
in your quest

357
00:48:33,652 --> 00:48:36,439
and why'd you do that?
- Because i'm jobless right now

358
00:48:37,818 --> 00:48:39,993
because you are
a complete stranger here

359
00:48:40,478 --> 00:48:44,674
because i know every nook and corner
hereabouts. You will need me

360
00:48:45,028 --> 00:48:47,453
how did a thief just turn kind?

361
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:52,714
One mustn't lose an opportunity
to help others

362
00:48:53,167 --> 00:48:54,216
nice line

363
00:48:55,315 --> 00:48:58,581
where did you steal the money from?
- Are you taunting me?

364
00:49:03,871 --> 00:49:04,798
All right

365
00:49:06,754 --> 00:49:10,590
now i understand. What else
do we have apart from that photo?

366
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:13,637
Some thing surely?

367
00:49:15,343 --> 00:49:17,549
What madcap would come
with just a photo?

368
00:49:17,906 --> 00:49:18,834
I would

369
00:49:21,687 --> 00:49:22,998
one photo...?

370
00:49:24,507 --> 00:49:27,358
With one photograph, we are going
to knock every door...

371
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:34,078
and in twenty years we'll find
this guy named... shankar?

372
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:38,247
What's this?

373
00:49:40,914 --> 00:49:43,251
When one's tongue is tied,

374
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:46,455
his emotions betray him

375
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,356
see the picture on the wall?

376
00:49:50,782 --> 00:49:53,886
The place seems familiar.
It's not clear though

377
00:49:57,319 --> 00:49:58,783
come with me

378
00:50:35,901 --> 00:50:39,703
look, this man has been
evading income tax

379
00:50:40,708 --> 00:50:43,559
it's now everyone's responsibility
to nab him...

380
00:50:44,552 --> 00:50:46,979
because he's evading
the income tax department

381
00:50:48,398 --> 00:50:49,326
and...

382
00:50:51,442 --> 00:50:53,168
please enlarge this photograph

383
00:50:53,846 --> 00:50:55,506
we'll glue it everywhere

384
00:50:55,833 --> 00:50:58,454
one photograph, everywhere?
Don't you need copies?

385
00:51:01,535 --> 00:51:03,677
You are the boss

386
00:51:04,868 --> 00:51:07,140
the income tax department
will be grateful to you

387
00:51:07,721 --> 00:51:09,993
in fact, the whole country
will be grateful to you

388
00:51:10,636 --> 00:51:13,291
and... please...

389
00:51:14,290 --> 00:51:16,180
enlarge this particular point

390
00:51:38,323 --> 00:51:39,404
here you are

391
00:51:42,168 --> 00:51:45,970
you will be paid for this.
Please go to the income tax office...

392
00:51:46,334 --> 00:51:50,945
show this card and mention hybrid singh.
You will be issued a cheque

393
00:51:51,494 --> 00:51:53,918
please don't refuse.
Thank you

394
00:52:00,369 --> 00:52:03,220
i was right. It's jodhpur

395
00:52:03,766 --> 00:52:04,694
come on

396
00:52:06,907 --> 00:52:09,660
trust me. It's jodhpur, i know

397
00:52:10,143 --> 00:52:12,185
i'll take you there. Come on

398
00:52:13,059 --> 00:52:16,292
half-hour to the bus-stop,
half-hour for the bus to arrive,

399
00:52:16,744 --> 00:52:20,525
half-hour to reach the junction
from where we've to take another bus

400
00:52:43,788 --> 00:52:46,094
now, to find the place
where this photo was taken

401
00:52:46,736 --> 00:52:47,667
meaning?

402
00:52:48,723 --> 00:52:49,653
Listen...

403
00:52:56,254 --> 00:52:59,455
groundnut is what
we'll feed on from now on

404
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:02,370
where is she? Where?

405
00:53:09,231 --> 00:53:10,859
Where to?

406
00:53:17,916 --> 00:53:21,336
You make me walk miles, you don't
feed me food or water

407
00:53:21,697 --> 00:53:25,314
i feel like jumping off
from where you are right now

408
00:53:26,631 --> 00:53:27,877
i'm tired

409
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:46,684
i was right here

410
00:53:49,063 --> 00:53:50,757
now what, chief?

411
00:53:52,427 --> 00:53:55,564
What does that mean?
- We divide the territory amongst us

412
00:53:56,561 --> 00:53:59,565
what...? Thousands of homes...?
- So?

413
00:54:00,407 --> 00:54:02,679
We can't knock all doors.
- I'm willing to knock...

414
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:05,177
all the doors in rajasthan.
Thousands hardly matter

415
00:54:05,501 --> 00:54:08,374
we are not sure if they live here.
They might've come here on a vacation

416
00:54:08,738 --> 00:54:11,906
we'll know only after inquiring.
- Good god! Wait...

417
00:54:13,096 --> 00:54:14,985
this is idiotic

418
00:54:15,788 --> 00:54:18,955
this may be their house

419
00:54:31,809 --> 00:54:33,700
we need help

420
00:54:40,461 --> 00:54:41,390
conman

421
00:54:45,237 --> 00:54:46,896
not about money

422
00:54:48,087 --> 00:54:49,814
he betrayed my trust

423
00:54:50,331 --> 00:54:52,221
but he gathered the courage
to return

424
00:54:52,638 --> 00:54:53,568
yes

425
00:55:11,159 --> 00:55:12,984
they may be rajputs

426
00:55:15,038 --> 00:55:17,888
golden nose-ring,
the colourful turban,

427
00:55:18,370 --> 00:55:20,762
chain around the neck,
their dresses,

428
00:55:21,254 --> 00:55:25,515
i told you. Master-ji used to teach
history of rajasthan. He's retired

429
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,749
did anyone ask you?

430
00:55:30,739 --> 00:55:31,666
No

431
00:55:33,366 --> 00:55:38,076
i can't figure out more.
They could be...

432
00:55:39,038 --> 00:55:39,966
master-ji...

433
00:55:42,243 --> 00:55:44,252
master-ji...
- what?

434
00:55:44,742 --> 00:55:47,910
I was wondering
if they are agni clan...?

435
00:55:49,068 --> 00:55:50,215
No, no way

436
00:55:54,002 --> 00:55:54,932
yes

437
00:55:55,797 --> 00:55:57,523
they could be the agnis

438
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:02,967
fifty kilometres from here,
across highway 11...

439
00:56:03,904 --> 00:56:08,668
there's a village called sarovar.
Go there, you might find something

440
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:12,421
thank you. Thank you so much

441
00:56:14,286 --> 00:56:16,013
thank you, master-ji

442
00:56:20,631 --> 00:56:21,560
stop

443
00:56:30,373 --> 00:56:35,017
take a pinch of the powder with
milk tonight. You'll be fine, trust me

444
00:56:49,118 --> 00:56:49,981
yes?

445
00:56:50,369 --> 00:56:52,543
Does this house belong
to shankar singh?

446
00:56:52,932 --> 00:56:53,861
Yes

447
00:56:54,597 --> 00:56:57,056
my husband and shankar are friends

448
00:56:58,701 --> 00:56:59,629
were

449
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:02,513
come in

450
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:13,492
good you came to meet us

451
00:57:14,403 --> 00:57:18,203
accidents often happen.
But it hurts

452
00:57:18,919 --> 00:57:22,667
it must be devastating for all of you
and shankar's wife

453
00:57:23,693 --> 00:57:26,480
is she here?
- Yes, meera must be working inside

454
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:30,031
how does your husband know shankar?

455
00:57:34,333 --> 00:57:36,955
Amir and shankar were roommates
in saudi

456
00:57:39,429 --> 00:57:40,378
roommates?

457
00:57:43,881 --> 00:57:48,012
Is he the one who...
- yes. But it wasn't intended

458
00:57:49,041 --> 00:57:50,504
it was an accident

459
00:57:50,931 --> 00:57:52,527
how dare you come here?

460
00:57:52,982 --> 00:57:55,506
Are you here to destroy our village?
- No!

461
00:57:56,251 --> 00:57:58,622
I understand your pain.
- Get out of here

462
00:57:58,942 --> 00:58:01,467
i wish to talk to shankar's wife.
- Bitch

463
00:58:01,795 --> 00:58:03,390
watch your tongue!

464
00:58:06,313 --> 00:58:10,728
Look, your anger is justified.
But we can have a decent discussion

465
00:58:12,274 --> 00:58:15,092
i want to meet meera.
- Not possible

466
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:19,733
for god's sake, listen to my request.
I want to talk to meera...

467
00:58:59,795 --> 00:59:01,586
not a word goes to meera

468
00:59:09,408 --> 00:59:10,336
what happened?

469
00:59:11,298 --> 00:59:14,685
Say something.
- There must be a way to meet her

470
00:59:16,009 --> 00:59:18,533
if i get to talk to her once,
i'll tell you

471
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:23,498
we will wait for here over here
and find out her schedules

472
00:59:24,116 --> 00:59:26,574
we? Meaning?
- You and i

473
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:27,928
you and i

474
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:06,995
so this is your relative's home.
- That was a small lie.

475
01:01:07,287 --> 01:01:09,829
In your company,
even i'll learn to lie.

476
01:01:10,121 --> 01:01:11,412
You are not learning
anything from me.

477
01:01:11,539 --> 01:01:12,669
No, that's not true.

478
01:01:12,961 --> 01:01:16,142
I have learnt how difficult
a woman's life is from a man's.

479
01:01:20,274 --> 01:01:22,380
But meera's life is useless.

480
01:01:22,548 --> 01:01:24,274
It's good i was born a man.

481
01:01:25,258 --> 01:01:28,439
Atleast you realise
what a woman suffers.

482
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:32,784
Is this what you women suffer?
- You haven't seen anything yet.

483
01:01:33,204 --> 01:01:36,569
If our wife dies, we marry again.

484
01:01:37,557 --> 01:01:41,053
But if your husband dies,
you wear colorless clothes...

485
01:01:41,337 --> 01:01:43,201
and spend your entire life
like a prisoner.

486
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:45,779
You work like servants,
no song, no dance...

487
01:01:46,071 --> 01:01:48,873
and spend your entire life alone,
with no contact with any man.

488
01:01:49,856 --> 01:01:51,716
Even thinking about it scares me.

489
01:01:51,933 --> 01:01:53,975
Now when you are seeing the
world from my viewpoint...

490
01:01:54,108 --> 01:01:55,498
tell me, what have you found out?

491
01:01:56,413 --> 01:01:58,960
She leaves the house once in
a day, to go to the temple.

492
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:10,481
Help me. For god sake,
you will have to help me!

493
01:03:11,082 --> 01:03:12,943
Sure, but who are you?

494
01:03:16,194 --> 01:03:18,999
I have come from very far.

495
01:03:21,489 --> 01:03:23,726
Okay. Come.

496
01:03:32,274 --> 01:03:33,186
Sit.

497
01:03:38,515 --> 01:03:41,068
Now tell me, why are you upset?

498
01:03:42,301 --> 01:03:44,537
I...
- meera didi!

499
01:03:45,139 --> 01:03:48,321
You didn't go to school again?
- Who is she?

500
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:50,718
Go get water.
- Okay.

501
01:03:53,590 --> 01:03:55,448
Where have you come from?

502
01:03:59,267 --> 01:04:02,073
That is at a very high altitude,
in the north, right?

503
01:04:03,052 --> 01:04:04,909
Yes.
- Meera didi.

504
01:04:05,888 --> 01:04:06,803
Water.

505
01:04:08,727 --> 01:04:09,639
Take. Go.

506
01:04:09,735 --> 01:04:11,906
If you want to talk in
private, say so.

507
01:04:13,457 --> 01:04:14,744
Okay, i'll leave.

508
01:04:19,133 --> 01:04:22,874
Is your place beautiful?
- Yes, as much as yours.

509
01:04:23,294 --> 01:04:24,208
But different.

510
01:04:26,132 --> 01:04:27,991
The beauty here is unique.

511
01:04:28,593 --> 01:04:32,332
Dry, tough, and as cruel
as the scorching sun.

512
01:04:35,216 --> 01:04:36,814
What have you lost here?

513
01:04:39,945 --> 01:04:43,687
My husband, amir...
- he left you?

514
01:04:45,053 --> 01:04:48,353
Yes.
- And you think you'll find him here?

515
01:04:48,458 --> 01:04:49,996
If you help me.

516
01:04:50,666 --> 01:04:52,526
You don't take me to be
something else, do you?

517
01:04:55,961 --> 01:04:58,197
Your husband had come here to work?

518
01:04:58,802 --> 01:05:03,874
Then he must have come to work where
they are putting up a new factory.

519
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:06,338
A lot of laborers have
come from outside.

520
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:10,497
You want me to talk to chopraji?

521
01:05:12,991 --> 01:05:14,851
The one who is
putting up the factory.

522
01:05:17,719 --> 01:05:20,268
How do you know he is
staying in our mansion?

523
01:05:20,557 --> 01:05:21,471
They were saying
so in the village.

524
01:05:21,567 --> 01:05:24,312
I did come to your house,
but your family threw me out.

525
01:05:25,289 --> 01:05:27,526
So that was you who
everyone was shouting at?

526
01:05:29,074 --> 01:05:31,311
I thought it was some
beggar woman of the village.

527
01:05:31,912 --> 01:05:35,653
I was begging only.
- Okay, i'll do something.

528
01:05:35,757 --> 01:05:39,446
But chopraji is not here,
he will return in a few days.

529
01:05:39,856 --> 01:05:41,330
I can wait for some days.

530
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:44,112
I'd brought water.
What do i do now?

531
01:05:44,522 --> 01:05:46,942
Oh, i forgot!
I'll just be back.

532
01:05:50,769 --> 01:05:55,452
Ila, i was talking. I forgot.
- You always do that.

533
01:05:55,876 --> 01:05:58,295
Always? Ofcourse not.

534
01:05:59,281 --> 01:06:02,461
Khama gani... now you reply,
gani khama.

535
01:06:05,903 --> 01:06:07,761
Is even your husband lost?
- Ila!

536
01:06:07,857 --> 01:06:09,397
You can say that.

537
01:06:10,635 --> 01:06:13,116
Then you also come to tie
a ribbon on this tree.

538
01:06:13,221 --> 01:06:14,134
He will return.

539
01:06:15,366 --> 01:06:17,408
There are many ways to
please the heart.

540
01:06:17,634 --> 01:06:20,437
I want to give you amir's photo
will you come here tomorrow?

541
01:06:20,662 --> 01:06:24,219
Without doubt. I get only one
opportunity to leave jail.

542
01:06:24,821 --> 01:06:25,736
Bye.

543
01:06:33,338 --> 01:06:37,467
Let's go... you talk too much.

544
01:06:51,248 --> 01:06:55,377
You should have told her the truth.
- You are talking of truth?

545
01:06:56,294 --> 01:06:58,206
Why do you always taunt me?

546
01:06:59,196 --> 01:07:01,056
It's the first time
i've lost courage in life.

547
01:07:03,545 --> 01:07:05,406
What if she had refused?

548
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:09,566
What is your intention?

549
01:07:10,167 --> 01:07:11,081
I don't know.

550
01:07:13,006 --> 01:07:14,294
Let's see what happens.

551
01:07:15,842 --> 01:07:19,027
I'll make friends with her,
win her confidence.

552
01:07:19,628 --> 01:07:22,809
Maybe then i'll tell her.
- So my role is over.

553
01:07:23,413 --> 01:07:25,957
You will go out everyday,
do your work.

554
01:07:26,249 --> 01:07:28,108
I'll wait for you at home.

555
01:07:29,089 --> 01:07:32,831
Great! The river
is flowing reverse.

556
01:07:33,820 --> 01:07:35,676
This is absolute injustice.

557
01:07:36,593 --> 01:07:38,452
A woman is deeply
connected to that word.

558
01:07:38,546 --> 01:07:41,665
Why don't you women join
hands and teach men a lesson?

559
01:07:42,271 --> 01:07:43,185
Maybe, one day.

560
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:45,430
They are paying rs.50.

561
01:07:45,526 --> 01:07:46,771
Will the camel not get up?

562
01:07:48,284 --> 01:07:53,374
He's a thoughtful camel. He's
in a dilemma. Just two minutes...

563
01:07:54,055 --> 01:07:56,325
they have to leave.

564
01:07:56,934 --> 01:07:59,205
Enough now! Get up!

565
01:08:02,703 --> 01:08:03,634
How obedient.

566
01:08:09,430 --> 01:08:12,981
I'm enjoying so much after
so many days, thanks to you.

567
01:08:15,198 --> 01:08:19,001
Shanker loved to sit near the river
and watch the setting sun.

568
01:08:20,007 --> 01:08:23,805
When the sun set, and the
moon rose, he would say...

569
01:08:23,912 --> 01:08:30,547
<i>'meera, one day, you and me will
go on the moon riding a camel"</i>

570
01:08:30,963 --> 01:08:32,852
<i>'where there will
be just you and me'</i>

571
01:08:33,465 --> 01:08:35,737
<i>'and there will be so much
love as much as there is sand here'</i>

572
01:08:36,347 --> 01:08:39,200
<i>'where you won't
have to wear this veil'</i>

573
01:08:40,193 --> 01:08:44,704
and he would always say,
if women have to wear a veil...

574
01:08:44,996 --> 01:08:46,890
even men should
carry a similar burden.

575
01:08:47,884 --> 01:08:49,774
Shall i say something?
- What?

576
01:08:49,870 --> 01:08:52,076
When there is talk
of carrying a burden...

577
01:08:52,688 --> 01:08:54,576
have you ever worn a turban?

578
01:08:59,416 --> 01:09:03,217
Shall i say something?
You are a very bad actor.

579
01:09:04,219 --> 01:09:06,114
You will put impostors to shame.

580
01:09:06,210 --> 01:09:08,415
I recognised you
the moment i saw you.

581
01:09:24,466 --> 01:09:26,357
Stop.
- Why? What happened?

582
01:09:26,453 --> 01:09:28,658
Make the camel sit.
- How?

583
01:09:28,793 --> 01:09:32,506
<i>Pull the rope and say 'r... rr'</i>

584
01:09:37,925 --> 01:09:39,234
sit down, camel.

585
01:09:43,051 --> 01:09:48,772
Sit... sit... he sat down!

586
01:09:49,781 --> 01:09:50,709
Come.

587
01:09:53,241 --> 01:09:55,130
Where are you going?

588
01:10:08,942 --> 01:10:12,425
Why should i turn away?
Even i can dance!

589
01:11:19,688 --> 01:11:21,000
It was fun, wasn't it?
- Yes.

590
01:11:21,227 --> 01:11:23,533
But we are very late,
will there be a problem?

591
01:11:23,533 --> 01:11:27,730
I'll say i was listening to hymns.
The act begins now.

592
01:11:59,039 --> 01:12:03,230
What woman dances with her friends
when her husband's life is at stake?

593
01:12:03,842 --> 01:12:10,278
One who knows what she wants,
and she can do anything to get it.

594
01:12:11,533 --> 01:12:16,045
It is not so simple anymore.
I really like her.

595
01:12:16,339 --> 01:12:19,576
Hiding the fact from her
makes me feel guilty.

596
01:12:20,186 --> 01:12:21,680
I feel like i'm cheating a friend.

597
01:12:42,228 --> 01:12:43,158
You?

598
01:12:43,507 --> 01:12:46,745
Sorry i'm disturbing you
at such a late hour.

599
01:12:47,038 --> 01:12:48,666
It's okay. Come inside.

600
01:12:48,957 --> 01:12:51,808
It's okay.
I have a small favor to ask.

601
01:12:55,687 --> 01:12:58,276
My friend is looking
for her husband.

602
01:12:58,570 --> 01:13:00,842
He may be working in your factory.

603
01:13:01,838 --> 01:13:03,731
Can you find out?

604
01:13:04,340 --> 01:13:06,612
Sure, i'll make inquiries.

605
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:08,150
Thank you.

606
01:13:26,446 --> 01:13:28,073
Where had you gone?

607
01:13:28,370 --> 01:13:31,605
Don't worry, i'm a man,
i can take care of myself.

608
01:13:33,178 --> 01:13:37,306
Any reason for drinking?
- To gather courage.

609
01:13:49,451 --> 01:13:51,723
I was to say something important.

610
01:13:54,261 --> 01:13:55,570
What?

611
01:14:00,027 --> 01:14:04,791
Stop your nonsense! Fool!
Let's have dinner.

612
01:14:05,793 --> 01:14:09,596
Wait! This answer
was not in my book.

613
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:13,835
No, you cannot say that. You cannot.

614
01:14:14,445 --> 01:14:17,297
I can say whatever i wish.
- Yes, this is right.

615
01:14:18,871 --> 01:14:21,141
I want to say something more.

616
01:14:24,061 --> 01:14:28,568
I know you are married,
you love your husband.

617
01:14:28,864 --> 01:14:33,577
I respect him. I don't
want anything from you.

618
01:14:34,952 --> 01:14:38,122
I just wanted to express my feelings.

619
01:14:40,334 --> 01:14:43,185
If i have learnt anything
from you...

620
01:14:43,282 --> 01:14:46,450
it is to express your feelings.

621
01:14:47,065 --> 01:14:51,260
Thank you.
- Express your feelings.

622
01:14:51,871 --> 01:14:56,633
And those are, i love you.

623
01:14:57,640 --> 01:14:59,912
Thank you. Shall we dine now?

624
01:15:00,908 --> 01:15:02,401
Wait a minute.

625
01:15:03,408 --> 01:15:06,255
I want to say something important.

626
01:15:09,558 --> 01:15:12,411
I know zeenat that you...

627
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:31,569
did i talk rubbish last night?
- Yes, but sweet rubbish.

628
01:15:33,525 --> 01:15:36,692
I'll have to go, zeenat.
- I know.

629
01:15:36,986 --> 01:15:41,181
You told me last night.
- But i don't know when i'll return.

630
01:15:41,793 --> 01:15:47,517
I know. What you did for me, i
cannot expect that much from any man.

631
01:15:48,522 --> 01:15:50,795
I saved the honor of my clan.

632
01:16:03,326 --> 01:16:09,628
I feel bad leaving you,
but...

633
01:16:17,746 --> 01:16:21,549
my dear impostor,
i will miss you a lot.

634
01:16:22,165 --> 01:16:24,437
But i have to fight
this battle alone.

635
01:16:28,829 --> 01:16:32,631
Call up amir's parents,
and tell them i'm fine.

636
01:16:32,737 --> 01:16:38,792
This is their phone number.
- I'll tell them. Take care.

637
01:17:44,705 --> 01:17:48,900
It feels good coming here. These
old mansions have a unique charm.

638
01:17:49,509 --> 01:17:51,781
Why are you rubbing salt
in my wounds?

639
01:17:52,011 --> 01:17:55,944
You misunderstand.
I was going to talk business.

640
01:17:56,242 --> 01:18:01,964
If i had anything else to give,
i'd never give this mansion on rent.

641
01:18:02,073 --> 01:18:05,242
You do have something you can give.

642
01:18:06,816 --> 01:18:09,720
Look, i live here for months.

643
01:18:10,083 --> 01:18:14,464
And truly speaking,
i feel lonely.

644
01:18:15,465 --> 01:18:17,737
And then, a man has his needs.

645
01:18:19,311 --> 01:18:22,541
The fact is, i want meera.

646
01:18:26,041 --> 01:18:28,311
She will live here, keep me happy.

647
01:18:28,922 --> 01:18:33,117
In exchange, i will repay the loan
of rs.300000 on the mansion.

648
01:18:33,730 --> 01:18:36,316
And anyway, what does she
mean to you anyway?

649
01:18:36,614 --> 01:18:37,541
She's just a slave.

650
01:18:45,262 --> 01:18:48,498
Only until i have
put up the factory.

651
01:18:50,073 --> 01:18:52,660
In a few months,
you will get back both...

652
01:18:54,298 --> 01:18:55,794
the mansion and your daughter-in-law.

653
01:19:16,983 --> 01:19:19,773
Meera is beautiful,
and young too.

654
01:19:20,767 --> 01:19:24,318
The mansion is old and ugly.

655
01:19:26,535 --> 01:19:28,424
It needs renovation.

656
01:19:29,416 --> 01:19:31,306
Everything has a price.

657
01:19:31,405 --> 01:19:33,926
I like people who strike a deal.

658
01:19:34,607 --> 01:19:36,108
Shall we shake hands
on rs.500000?

659
01:20:20,302 --> 01:20:26,024
Get up, zeenat.
- I knew you'd not leave me and go.

660
01:20:27,029 --> 01:20:31,545
There's a problem, zeenat.
I spoke to amir's parents.

661
01:20:31,898 --> 01:20:34,424
They were looking for
you since many days.

662
01:20:34,716 --> 01:20:36,992
The day for amir's
execution has been fixed.

663
01:20:38,950 --> 01:20:40,837
He will be executed in two days.

664
01:20:41,451 --> 01:20:44,487
There is some natraja who
is waiting for you in jaipur.

665
01:20:44,718 --> 01:20:47,173
He says he will take
the letter of pardon himself.

666
01:20:49,137 --> 01:20:51,026
We will have to leave for
jaipur tomorrow itself...

667
01:20:52,025 --> 01:20:53,333
with the pardon letter.

668
01:20:57,790 --> 01:21:01,592
The one above.
- Salaam waleikum.

669
01:21:01,701 --> 01:21:02,944
Salaam waleikum?

670
01:21:03,558 --> 01:21:06,411
Say khama gani. What rubbish
are they teaching you in school?

671
01:21:06,508 --> 01:21:08,331
Not in school,
zeenat didi taught me.

672
01:21:08,426 --> 01:21:09,674
Who zeenat?

673
01:21:09,903 --> 01:21:12,556
The one who meets meera didi
in the temple everyday

674
01:21:23,684 --> 01:21:25,572
you are late?
- Yes, i am late.

675
01:21:26,565 --> 01:21:30,366
Meera, you'll have to help me.
- You said that on the first day too.

676
01:21:31,369 --> 01:21:34,221
Will you help me?
- Must you ask?

677
01:21:35,214 --> 01:21:37,488
But first come,
i want to give you something.

678
01:21:39,444 --> 01:21:42,293
Shanker had given it to me.
His first gift.

679
01:21:42,424 --> 01:21:45,742
I cannot wear it now, but i
remove and look at it sometimes.

680
01:21:45,851 --> 01:21:47,416
I see some color.

681
01:21:47,711 --> 01:21:50,593
I want that when you meet
amir, you two wear it.

682
01:21:50,593 --> 01:21:52,485
Like me and shanker.

683
01:21:52,901 --> 01:21:55,755
It is a symbol of love.

684
01:21:55,976 --> 01:21:57,987
I cannot take it, it won't be right.

685
01:21:58,283 --> 01:22:02,480
Why not? You won't understand
what your friendship has given me.

686
01:22:03,090 --> 01:22:05,682
You will leave,
and we may never meet again.

687
01:22:06,102 --> 01:22:10,364
If you keep this, you will remember
you have a friend in rajasthan...

688
01:22:10,780 --> 01:22:13,303
who didn't have the courage to
choose her life's path...

689
01:22:13,985 --> 01:22:16,837
but being with you,
she got a glimpse of it.

690
01:22:18,409 --> 01:22:20,996
If you can,
you also give me a memento.

691
01:22:22,252 --> 01:22:23,178
Who knows...

692
01:22:23,277 --> 01:22:25,101
your husband died
at my husband's hands.

693
01:23:05,508 --> 01:23:11,180
I wanted to tell you since very long,
my god knows; but i could not tell you

694
01:23:13,135 --> 01:23:14,445
why, zeenat?

695
01:23:15,055 --> 01:23:16,683
When i first came to your house...

696
01:23:16,979 --> 01:23:19,572
your family spat in my
face and threw me out.

697
01:23:19,865 --> 01:23:23,096
I was afraid even
you will refuse to meet me.

698
01:23:24,669 --> 01:23:26,941
I never intended to cheat you.

699
01:23:28,516 --> 01:23:30,403
What do you want from me?

700
01:23:37,166 --> 01:23:41,362
These are papers for pardon.
If you sign them...

701
01:23:41,972 --> 01:23:43,863
amir's life can be saved.

702
01:23:57,353 --> 01:23:59,627
You are aware of
everything, zeenat.

703
01:24:00,622 --> 01:24:03,472
Do you also know
how a person feels...

704
01:24:04,082 --> 01:24:08,211
when one leaves home alive,
and the news of his death returns?

705
01:24:08,824 --> 01:24:13,586
And then his belongings, his clothes,
stuffed in a torn suitcase?

706
01:24:15,937 --> 01:24:19,104
So you tell me, you,
who knows everything...

707
01:24:19,784 --> 01:24:21,672
you, who makes her own life...

708
01:24:23,243 --> 01:24:26,475
what do you think?
What should i do?

709
01:24:30,933 --> 01:24:33,207
If i don't sign these papers,
i will be considered cruel.

710
01:24:34,775 --> 01:24:38,578
And if i do, i'll crush the pride
with which i am living.

711
01:24:38,688 --> 01:24:43,135
No meera, i know amir.
He cannot kill anyone.

712
01:24:44,776 --> 01:24:49,538
Know what my dream is?
That i behead that murderer...

713
01:24:49,675 --> 01:24:51,787
who snatched
my everything from me...

714
01:24:52,083 --> 01:24:55,313
my husband, my love, my freedom.

715
01:24:58,809 --> 01:25:04,533
Surprised? That the innocent,
naive meera is talking of killing?

716
01:25:05,475 --> 01:25:07,362
I understand your feelings.

717
01:25:07,717 --> 01:25:10,819
If i was in your place,
even i'd think the same.

718
01:25:11,243 --> 01:25:16,585
Then you can understand why
i am refusing to sign these papers.

719
01:25:20,855 --> 01:25:24,090
Make your own decisions,
isn't that what you had said?

720
01:25:25,662 --> 01:25:27,933
Take, this is my decision.

721
01:25:28,930 --> 01:25:31,782
I also said you will have to accept
the consequences of your decisions.

722
01:25:32,390 --> 01:25:33,700
Will you be able to?

723
01:25:53,538 --> 01:25:56,124
Meera, i plead with you!

724
01:25:56,420 --> 01:25:59,656
Why? Because i should
take the right path?

725
01:26:00,266 --> 01:26:02,188
Because what happened
was an accident.

726
01:26:02,188 --> 01:26:05,606
Amir did not deliberately
kill shanker. They were friends!

727
01:26:05,715 --> 01:26:09,778
So what if he didn't kill him
deliberately. He ruined my life.

728
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:11,444
I want it's price.

729
01:26:11,739 --> 01:26:13,627
Even if an innocent man
has to pay for it?

730
01:26:13,725 --> 01:26:16,509
Yes, even then. Your husband
committed the murder...

731
01:26:16,606 --> 01:26:18,432
and an innocent woman
is paying its price.

732
01:26:18,529 --> 01:26:22,017
I am fed up of my helplessness,
i want revenge!

733
01:26:24,235 --> 01:26:28,996
Even your quran says that,
eye for an eye, life for a life.

734
01:26:31,923 --> 01:26:33,811
Then the decision is made.

735
01:26:35,768 --> 01:26:39,320
<i>The same quran says, 'forgiving
is greater than revenge'</i>

736
01:26:41,538 --> 01:26:44,123
if you had not cheated me
like this...

737
01:26:44,486 --> 01:26:47,270
i would perhaps forgive
you and your husband.

738
01:26:49,228 --> 01:26:51,116
I trusted your friendship.

739
01:26:53,070 --> 01:26:54,699
But even you turned
out to be like others.

740
01:26:55,957 --> 01:26:59,188
A selfish woman who uses
others for her selfish needs.

741
01:26:59,801 --> 01:27:01,627
I'm still your friend.

742
01:27:57,410 --> 01:28:01,607
Forgive me, amir.
Forgive me!

743
01:28:34,899 --> 01:28:36,787
Where had you gone?

744
01:28:37,781 --> 01:28:40,633
I permit you to go to the
temple so that you find peace.

745
01:28:41,627 --> 01:28:45,178
And behind my back, you are
making friends with that woman...

746
01:28:45,473 --> 01:28:47,363
who ruined our lives.

747
01:28:49,319 --> 01:28:51,207
A woman should not be given freedom.

748
01:28:54,124 --> 01:28:56,333
You make friends with the
murderer of your husband?

749
01:28:56,944 --> 01:28:58,572
With my son's murderer?

750
01:28:58,867 --> 01:29:02,667
Zeenat did not kill shanker.
- You argue with us?

751
01:29:03,098 --> 01:29:06,515
It is not her fault. That's
woman's influence is talking.

752
01:29:06,942 --> 01:29:09,150
Or she would never
let out a whisper.

753
01:29:10,404 --> 01:29:15,877
Her freedom is over!
She will not leave the house...

754
01:29:16,171 --> 01:29:18,761
until my wounded honor heals.

755
01:29:20,014 --> 01:29:22,286
What honor are you talking of?

756
01:29:26,747 --> 01:29:30,941
The same honor which you are
selling to save this mansion?

757
01:29:31,937 --> 01:29:35,355
Or that honor, on the strength
of which, my price is being fixed?

758
01:29:36,355 --> 01:29:39,210
You use me when you wish,
you throw me when you wish.

759
01:29:39,304 --> 01:29:41,828
Make me your family
honor when you wish.

760
01:29:44,047 --> 01:29:46,900
Even after all this,
you will not throw me out.

761
01:29:47,892 --> 01:29:50,166
Because i am very valuable for you.

762
01:29:52,698 --> 01:29:56,761
You talk of my honor,
but i have not come across...

763
01:29:56,863 --> 01:29:58,754
a more shameless man than you.

764
01:30:13,782 --> 01:30:15,091
Leave my hand!

765
01:30:17,629 --> 01:30:18,940
Leave my hand!

766
01:30:23,396 --> 01:30:27,591
I'd only given your son
the right to touch me.

767
01:31:00,816 --> 01:31:06,542
"Relationships, trust, love, faith"

768
01:31:08,509 --> 01:31:14,629
"i don't have any"

769
01:31:15,622 --> 01:31:21,350
"i thought i had the
earth in my hand"

770
01:31:22,930 --> 01:31:28,403
"i opened my hand,
and there was only ash"

771
01:31:28,696 --> 01:31:32,247
"there is this
noise in the heart"

772
01:31:32,543 --> 01:31:35,131
"if integrity is low"

773
01:31:36,384 --> 01:31:40,188
"if this string is weak"

774
01:32:20,220 --> 01:32:25,693
what do i do, grandma?
- What does your heart say?

775
01:32:27,270 --> 01:32:30,818
I have been suppressing my heart's
voice since so long...

776
01:32:31,113 --> 01:32:32,426
it died long ago.

777
01:32:33,036 --> 01:32:35,625
The heart never stops talking.

778
01:32:36,303 --> 01:32:39,725
Listen carefully,
it will show you the way.

779
01:32:43,033 --> 01:32:45,818
Shanker's death snatched
my life from my hands.

780
01:32:46,428 --> 01:32:49,020
But i compromised
with my fate.

781
01:32:49,315 --> 01:32:54,470
Because this has been my life.
Good or bad, i had to live it.

782
01:32:55,083 --> 01:32:58,634
Because you feared the
unknown world outside.

783
01:32:58,924 --> 01:33:03,441
Yes. It is easy to
follow a mould.

784
01:33:03,734 --> 01:33:06,006
Let life continue the
way it is.

785
01:33:06,615 --> 01:33:08,504
Our life's string is
in someone else's hands.

786
01:33:10,460 --> 01:33:14,974
But the string that has been put
in my hand, what do i do with it?

787
01:33:15,268 --> 01:33:19,461
Who lives, who dies,
let god decide that, why me?

788
01:33:20,074 --> 01:33:23,306
I don't want to decide.
I'm an ordinary woman.

789
01:33:23,918 --> 01:33:27,719
I can be selfish. The one who has
given me pain, i should hurt him.

790
01:33:28,149 --> 01:33:31,002
Why am i being forced
to be an angel?

791
01:33:31,608 --> 01:33:36,373
I don't want that status.
I don't want that right.

792
01:33:37,378 --> 01:33:39,649
He plays many games
with us, doesn't he?

793
01:33:42,182 --> 01:33:43,428
Somewhat more with me.

794
01:33:45,001 --> 01:33:48,805
Whatever decision you
have taken, stick to it.

795
01:33:50,770 --> 01:33:52,660
I have told zeenat that.

796
01:33:53,079 --> 01:33:58,420
Then what are you waiting for?
Go do what you want.

797
01:33:59,804 --> 01:34:04,566
What you are going to do,
only a human can do.

798
01:34:06,725 --> 01:34:08,997
Where are angels destined to it?

799
01:34:11,342 --> 01:34:15,145
Grandma, i...
- you don't have to say anything.

800
01:34:17,045 --> 01:34:22,455
I am only trying to cover up
my sins with your virtue.

801
01:34:35,950 --> 01:34:39,753
You know randhir will
surely sell you.

802
01:34:40,755 --> 01:34:45,137
I don't care about that now.
- That's better! My brave girl!

803
01:34:45,498 --> 01:34:46,427
Go.

804
01:34:53,189 --> 01:34:54,499
Where are you going?

805
01:34:55,113 --> 01:34:59,305
Let me go, mother-in-law.
It's a matter of someone's life.

806
01:35:00,875 --> 01:35:05,391
Don't even think of going out.
- She surely will.

807
01:35:07,607 --> 01:35:10,838
Taking pride in your husband,
don't forget your humanity.

808
01:35:11,453 --> 01:35:15,644
Remember, even you could be on
this side of the fence some day.

809
01:35:21,063 --> 01:35:25,258
Now move aside, and let her leave.

810
01:37:41,281 --> 01:37:46,437
Dear meera, i am sure you
will find this letter.

811
01:37:47,239 --> 01:37:48,933
I had come here on a mission.

812
01:37:49,353 --> 01:37:52,774
In that attempt,
i lied to you, cheated you.

813
01:37:53,776 --> 01:37:57,008
But i never wanted to hurt
your already hurting heart.

814
01:37:58,195 --> 01:38:01,169
Treat it as a hapless woman's
helplessness and forgive me.

815
01:38:02,427 --> 01:38:05,663
I am leaving dejected,
but not empty handed.

816
01:38:06,273 --> 01:38:08,545
Your friendship has filled my heart.

817
01:38:10,120 --> 01:38:15,272
Your love made me soft again,
which i had lost fighting life.

818
01:38:15,886 --> 01:38:19,432
What i am going through,
you are not responsible for it.

819
01:38:19,728 --> 01:38:21,357
I have no complaints against you.

820
01:38:21,651 --> 01:38:23,543
You are doing what is your right.

821
01:38:24,539 --> 01:38:30,262
In a few days, my amir...
but i will live my life again.

822
01:38:30,370 --> 01:38:32,828
A life of my principles,
my decisions.

823
01:38:33,505 --> 01:38:35,965
The world even snatched
that right from you.

824
01:38:36,968 --> 01:38:38,861
A right that every man must have.

825
01:38:39,855 --> 01:38:44,050
If i could,
i would bring shanker back.

826
01:38:45,042 --> 01:38:48,460
I would hand back the
string of your freedom to you.

827
01:38:50,428 --> 01:38:53,014
But i have only this charm
to give...

828
01:38:53,310 --> 01:38:56,545
with whose support i spent many
difficult moments of my life.

829
01:38:57,152 --> 01:38:59,745
I hope it gives you the
strength to fight the world.

830
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,271
Yours, zeenat.

831
01:44:36,719 --> 01:44:42,163
"How will this courage bow?"

832
01:44:43,118 --> 01:44:48,020
"How will this desire stop?"

833
01:44:48,601 --> 01:44:51,064
"So what if it's difficult
to reach destination?"

834
01:44:51,343 --> 01:44:54,055
"So what if the shore seems
a faded sight?"

835
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:58,989
"So what if the heart is broken"
