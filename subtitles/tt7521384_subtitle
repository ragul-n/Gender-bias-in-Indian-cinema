1
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,291
Stop confusing me.

2
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,791
I paid eight lakh rupees in total, right? 
-Yes.

3
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:32,500
Interest rate of 2.5%, correct? 
-Correct.

4
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:37,083
Three months later, it amounted 
to 9,15,350 rupees. Right?

5
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:40,416
Yes, but what about the two and half lakhs 
I gave you earlier?

6
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:44,291
That's for three months later. 
Amounts to 7,15,377 rupees.

7
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:45,750
Interest charged at 3%!

8
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:48,500
What? 
3% interest for seven lakh rupees?

9
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:49,750
Follow the math or not?

10
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:04,083
You're dressed like a groom, sir! 
Is it your wedding day?

11
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:05,208
What's the deal, sir?

12
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:08,291
Today, everyone's booze should be on you! 
And you're asking me?

13
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:09,833
Get going and go get married!

14
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,083
You heard him. 
Get going!

15
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:17,416
You'll be back after the wedding, anyway! 
Please leave.

16
00:04:18,416 --> 00:04:20,291
At first, I gave eight and a half lakhs.

17
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:23,125
Yes, but I paid back two and half lakhs 
sometime ago!

18
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,458
That's at 2%, man! 
I'm talking about 3%!

19
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:26,750
No, you're wrong.

20
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:57,166
Awesome, sir! 
You nailed it!

21
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:59,750
Who is this guy? 
Like a computer that has sprouted limbs!

22
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:04,250
You're no ordinary guy! 
You're one of a kind! Come along!

23
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:05,375
Hey! Get up!

24
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,416
Waste of space! 
Scoot over to the corner!

25
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:08,541
Have a seat!

26
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,916
You solved a huge problem 
without batting an eye!

27
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:12,041
What's eating you?

28
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,083
I'll tell you.

29
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,500
But, my ego can't handle it.

30
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:18,625
Order a large round.

31
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,583
Hey! 
Get us a full bottle!

32
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:21,708
Here you go, sir!

33
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:27,500
He's drinking it like it's mother's milk!

34
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:32,583
Balu.

35
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,750
That name signified a genius!

36
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,291
It was a brand name!

37
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:43,333
Good grief!

38
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:47,333
Hold it right there.

39
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,708
"Balu signified a genius. 
A real brand name!"

40
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:50,833
Go beyond that!

41
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:56,833
First in the state in high school!

42
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,750
First in the state in junior college!

43
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,458
Ditto in the entrance exams, too!

44
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:06,291
After all that, you expect me 
to have my feet on the ground?

45
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,083
I was just soaring in the clouds!

46
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:18,208
Generally, I don't believe in luck.

47
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,791
But, as if to make me believe in it, 
my bad luck arrived by train!

48
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:32,791
Got a good look at my bad luck?

49
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:35,625
Like algebra clad in a half-sari...

50
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,375
Like cute-smiling quantum theory...

51
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,083
To increase my irritation 
by a factor of infinity...

52
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:42,958
...she came from Coimbatore by train!

53
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:46,666
Here's the kicker. 
The one who awoke, left for the station...

54
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:49,500
...reached the station, 
all within the auspicious hour...

55
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:54,000
...to receive my goddess of misfortune, 
was none other than my father!

56
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,125
Hello!

57
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,208
How are you? 
-I'm doing great!

58
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,333
Shall we go?

59
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:02,833
What about my luggage?

60
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:05,166
What? 
You expect me to carry that?

61
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,500
If so, I'll return back home!

62
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:11,750
I was just kidding, dear!

63
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:17,583
What, dear? 
-Did you see that?

64
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:19,375
Where? 
-A picture of Balu!

65
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:24,208
First is in the state is no joke.

66
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:26,291
Looks great! 
Hi 'mama' (maternal cousin)!

67
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:38,000
'Mahalakshmi has arrived at my house!'

68
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:44,958
Hello aunty!

69
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:48,666
Is my chicken ready?

70
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:51,666
I've already added masala to it.

71
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:53,625
Just a few minutes 
and it will be done!

72
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,666
Stop! Masala is for the chicken. 
You might apply it on her!

73
00:07:58,791 --> 00:07:59,791
Oh, stop!

74
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:07,458
Come on in!

75
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,500
This is your room!

76
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,541
Also, no matter what, 
don't go upstairs.

77
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,666
Why? 
-Because, Balu's room is up there!

78
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,791
Why? 
-He's very strict!

79
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:23,208
He bounces hard! 
His name even sounds like 'ball'!

80
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:49,750
Don't you know English?

81
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:53,583
Why did you come here? 
-Who are you kids?

82
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:55,583
I'm Fourth. 
-Fourth grade?

83
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:56,750
No! That's my name!

84
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,500
How so? 
-This is how it works here!

85
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:01,083
No names! 
Only ranks!

86
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,916
Balu calls us by rank only!

87
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,458
He doesn't have a name yet.

88
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,791
Because, he hasn't passed an exam yet!

89
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,375
He failed in Tamil!

90
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,500
What?

91
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,625
Failed in Tamil? 
-Nowadays, that is the in thing!

92
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,791
Who are you all? 
How did you get here?

93
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:24,416
That is a long story!

94
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,458
We came here for grandma's birthday.

95
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,500
I told them that we'd have cake and leave.

96
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:31,250
But, he suggested that we stay for dinner!

97
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,333
Until then, he said we could play cricket!

98
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:36,375
We did play cricket, 
but he hit the ball hard!

99
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,333
Our bad luck, 
the ball ended up in Balu's room.

100
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:40,541
It landed right there!

101
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:42,458
The ball was in Balu's hand!

102
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,750
I asked him to give it to me.

103
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,916
He asked what was two multiplied by two.

104
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:49,041
Stop. 
How much is two multiplied by two, sis?

105
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,250
Qualified!

106
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:00,833
That's what I said! 
And since that day, I've been here!

107
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:02,625
What about your parents?

108
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,208
Some parents they are!

109
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:07,625
Until I become like Balu, 
they made me to stay in Balu's room!

110
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,791
He's right. 
As a matter of fact, my eyes are fine!

111
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:14,250
Because Balu wears spectacles, 
I'm forced to wear them, too!

112
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,541
Regardless of all that, 
I love this room!

113
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:19,083
This isn't a room! 
This is a prison!

114
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:21,666
Look at this! 
We even wear uniforms at home!

115
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:22,791
Uniforms at home?

116
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,291
I can't believe this.

117
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,083
Sis!

118
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:30,250
Don't touch anything there! 
-Why?

119
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:32,750
Whatever you touch, 
he'll find out!

120
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,958
He's a walking closed circuit camera!

121
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:36,083
Is that so?

122
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:40,333
So if I took this pen and put a cap on it, 
would he figure it out?

123
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:42,000
Just take a look at the table.

124
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,666
People use pens 
to give marks on exam papers.

125
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:51,208
This guy marks pen positions!

126
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:55,125
Similar to that, 
he puts powder on the computer's mouse!

127
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,791
He opens up a pen 
and marks around it!

128
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:00,125
He places books 
in precise angles!

129
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,750
He changes up pieces 
on a chessboard!

130
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:05,000
These are Balu's tricks!

131
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,458
You didn't do anything, right?

132
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:13,958
If you did do anything, 
he'll really do us in!

133
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,500
Hey! 
You never told us who you are!

134
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:18,625
Who am I?

135
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,208
I'm Balu's bride-to-be!

136
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:23,583
Balu has no relatives!

137
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:24,833
Only ranks!

138
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:27,583
When Balu comes by, 
he won't ask you how you're doing!

139
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,416
He'd only ask what rank you are!

140
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:31,083
Balu is nothing like that!

141
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:32,625
I know him very well!

142
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:41,916
Someone was in my room.

143
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:43,791
It's just me, 'mama'!

144
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,291
What is your name?

145
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,833
Why? 
Don't you know?

146
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:51,708
I don't keep track of unwanted things.

147
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:55,416
Veeravenkata Satyasai 
Nagadurgadevi Sitamahalakashmi.

148
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,375
A hundred and twenty kilobytes.

149
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,166
I can't waste so much space on you. 
Shorten it!

150
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,541
What's your rank?

151
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:17,875
I'm first in the district, 'mama'! 
When it comes to singing!

152
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:21,916
(sings classical song)

153
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,458
I meant in studies!

154
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,333
Your score in your first year?

155
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,625
Well, that... is...

156
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,666
55 percent.

157
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:34,375
Do you know my percentage?

158
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:38,541
That's why I came here 
to join in your college!

159
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,375
That's my score! 
Not that of the college!

160
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:46,416
On the way to the house, 
I saw a huge banner with your picture!

161
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:48,208
It was awesome!

162
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:50,500
The one in the college bus stand 
is even cooler!

163
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:52,583
Coffee, 'mama'?

164
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,125
Look at that timetable.

165
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:05,250
What is this? 
-Green Peas Masala!

166
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:10,083
I can't waste so much memory on this!

167
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:11,208
Shorten it!

168
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:14,541
Sala!

169
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:23,375
How can you serve chicken in our house, 
aunty?

170
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:27,458
I made some because Mahalakshmi loves it. 
Eat, dear!

171
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:28,583
Thanks, aunty!

172
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:31,916
Sis!

173
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,166
Why not?

174
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,000
That's chicken, sis!

175
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:38,708
Yes, it's chicken!

176
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,250
But, today isn't Saturday!

177
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:43,291
Oh, so you don't eat chicken 
on Saturdays?

178
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:45,708
No, I don't.

179
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,875
From now on, every day is Saturday!

180
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:51,791
Why? 
-Balu hates chicken!

181
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,750
If so, I'll go back to my hometown.

182
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:58,791
Get up, sis!

183
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:12,875
You may sit.

184
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,250
Chow down! 
-Okay!

185
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,583
The good lady loves meat, does she?

186
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:58,375
What is your percentage?

187
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,208
Say it for everyone to hear.

188
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,750
55 percent.

189
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,416
Which stands for 'second class'!

190
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:07,583
The brain won't work if you eat meat. 
She is living proof of that!

191
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:11,333
What happens if you eat meat? 
-The brain won't work!

192
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:12,583
Mop!

193
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:14,583
Bro? 
-Get that chicken out of that plate!

194
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:15,708
Started already?

195
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,416
Take the leg piece from her hand!

196
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,291
So much for your chicken, huh?

197
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:23,500
Oh no! 
My chicken!

198
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,583
What is it? 
Eat!

199
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:34,583
I'm leaving, mom!

200
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:36,916
Wait! 
Take Maha with you!

201
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:38,500
No can do! 
-Why?

202
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:44,166
That girl is new to the city 
as well as to the college.

203
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:47,958
She was brought here to study with you.

204
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:49,916
Could you please drop her off, sir?

205
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,666
Let him go ahead, mom! 
I'll drop Mahalakshmi off at college!

206
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,666
You can drop her off today.

207
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:58,375
Who will do it tomorrow?

208
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,625
Let him do it.

209
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,125
Sorry, man! 
Tie it yourself!

210
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,166
I'm ready! 
Let's go!

211
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,583
Go and get a glass of water.

212
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:28,916
Here you go, 'mama'!

213
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:30,916
Drink!

214
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:36,791
Go and return the glass.

215
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,875
Maha! For dinner, shall I make chicken fry 
or chicken curry?

216
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,916
Both, aunty! 
Some curry and some fry!

217
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:54,166
Cancel the chicken, aunty!

218
00:16:58,208 --> 00:16:59,208
Did I tell you to sit?

219
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:02,833
Now sit.

220
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,916
Get down!

221
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,083
Why, 'mama'?

222
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:15,625
Call me 'mama' only at home!

223
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,916
In college, you must call me 'Balu'!

224
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,416
A share auto will come by! 
It'll take you to college!

225
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:38,041
'An exam is like an ex-lover!'

226
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:44,500
'It'll infiltrate your memory 
and torture you infinitely!'

227
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:50,875
'At the age where one is meant 
to spent soaring in the air...'

228
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,041
'...who the hell decided 
that it must be spent poring over books?'

229
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:57,208
'At the age meant to be spent 
practically in love...'

230
00:17:57,333 --> 00:18:00,375
'...who the hell forced all these theories 
into our life?'

231
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,666
'Oh God! 
We wished to soar!'

232
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,791
'Too bad! 
We don't have a wing!'

233
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:09,916
'Oh God! 
This is a colorful age!'

234
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:13,083
'Too bad you bent it beyond repair!'

235
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:17,125
'He who does everything right, 
that's Balu!'

236
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:25,750
'There is no one quite like him! 
Understand that well!'

237
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:42,083
'We sought to get an Oscar!'

238
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:45,250
'Mr. Rahman beat us to it first!'

239
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:48,500
'We studied hard 
so we could get that first rank!'

240
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:51,625
'There's Balu in our way. 
No way to get there!'

241
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,958
'Instead of watching films 
or listening to music in the restroom...'

242
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:58,000
'...read formulae 
and grow smart!'

243
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:01,291
'Read the content of your syllabus...'

244
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:04,416
'...with the same interest you have 
with those colorful magazines!'

245
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:08,791
'Oh wow! Really hit the nail in the head, 
Balu did too!'

246
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:17,166
'Is there anyone here quite like him? 
Is there? Is there someone at all?'

247
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:21,166
'He who does everything right, 
is Balu!'

248
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:30,041
'There is no one quite like him! 
You better that, dude!'

249
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:33,291
Buddy! 
The results are out!

250
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:34,833
Who's the second rank? 
-Ajay.

251
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:39,083
Give us a treat!

252
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:42,666
Why must I give one?

253
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:43,875
Didn't you come first?

254
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,875
Here, the rule states that 
the second ranker must give a treat!

255
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,416
Give out your orders, guys!

256
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,166
I didn't bring my wallet!

257
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,041
Stop it, guys! 
Listen to me!

258
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:57,166
Did you see that? 
My 'mama' is always on top of his class!

259
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,666
It is this college's tradition...

260
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:07,375
...to name newly constructed blocks 
after first rank holders.

261
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,333
I always knew you'd be the one 
on top!

262
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:13,750
Therefore, I've already named this block 
after you!

263
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:30,833
You've changed the rule of first rankers 
being the ones to give parties.

264
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:32,875
I have a small desire.

265
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,166
Just once, come second.

266
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:37,000
I'm sorry, sir. 
You will never get a treat for me!

267
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:40,666
Here you go, sir! 
-Thank You!

268
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:47,000
What gives, 'mama'? You seem so dull 
despite being college topper!

269
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:49,291
Had I come first, 
know what I would've done?

270
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:52,083
What would you have done? 
-I'd say "That is Mahalakshmi!"

271
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,333
Don't dream that big! 
That will never happen!

272
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:57,166
She calls you 'mama'? 
Aunt's daughter?

273
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,083
You smoke?

274
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:19,125
Only to ensure no one says I'm a topper 
because I have no vices.

275
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:25,625
Does the smell come across?

276
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:27,291
No.

277
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:32,000
Love letter for you! 
-From who? Deepa?

278
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,166
How did you know?

279
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,875
She was the only one 
who hadn't sent one yet. Read it.

280
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:41,125
"O future Bill Gates..."

281
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,291
"You have beautiful eyes!"

282
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:44,416
Underline that.

283
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:49,291
"Your spectacles are really dandy, too!"

284
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:51,791
Underline that, too.

285
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:56,083
"But, they don't suit you."

286
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:58,791
Scratch that. 
-Which one, 'mama'?

287
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:00,458
The first thing you read.

288
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:03,333
Which? 
The one about your "beautiful eyes"?

289
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:04,708
That one? 
-Hey!

290
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:10,000
"You ride the bike 
very stylishly!"

291
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:11,291
I've underlined it!

292
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:13,166
Underline it again!

293
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:18,000
"But, one more important thing..."

294
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:24,791
"Leaving that pretty cousin of yours 
behind at the bus stop, isn't cool at all!"

295
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:28,708
Quit using your brain too much 
and simply read what is written!

296
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:36,250
Didn't you say that your cousin Balu 
is a good guy and stuff?

297
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:38,166
Now look what happened!

298
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:40,708
He left you behind at the bus stop!

299
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:42,250
I don't even mind that!

300
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:44,833
But, he has told me not to call him 'mama' 
at college!

301
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:46,583
That is so hard for me!

302
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:49,041
So what? 
Be irreverent as hell with him!

303
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:50,166
He's my cousin, man!

304
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,875
A two year feud, sis! 
Two years!

305
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,583
Just because I honked his bike horn, 
he slapped me hard in the face!

306
00:22:57,708 --> 00:23:01,000
I will not rest until I get my revenge 
on him, sis!

307
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:03,416
Even that's fine!

308
00:23:03,541 --> 00:23:06,000
My name is Arjun. 
Lovely name to hear, right?

309
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:07,291
But that guy?

310
00:23:07,416 --> 00:23:11,125
How dare he refer to me as 'Sixth Ranker'?

311
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:13,708
I will not spare him, sis!

312
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,583
Sis!

313
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:18,791
I don't even brush my teeth 
with these fingers!

314
00:23:18,916 --> 00:23:22,041
But, he made me wash his bike 
with it, every day!

315
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:23,708
Hey! Get the water!

316
00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:26,833
Look at this picture, sis.

317
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:30,458
This is what I looked like, 
before I came to this house.

318
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:33,208
Constantly lugging water in here, 
made me like this!

319
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:35,250
He wears my clothes now!

320
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:39,750
Look how he pinched my thigh 
because I touched his computer once!

321
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:41,541
What is this? 
Such a huge birthmark?

322
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:45,333
Not a birthmark, sis! I marked the spot 
to ensure I wouldn't forget it!

323
00:23:46,541 --> 00:23:49,000
Why so silent, sis?

324
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:51,875
I have project work tomorrow. 
Need the computer for it!

325
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,375
Have you forgotten the rules, sis?

326
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,458
That is a topper's computer!

327
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:58,000
You can't use it!

328
00:23:58,125 --> 00:24:00,250
Topper, my foot!

329
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:02,333
If he's got the guts, 
ask him to fail once!

330
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:04,833
Only if one is a topper, 
can they use the computer?

331
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:06,708
What's wrong if sis uses it?

332
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:08,875
Nothing wrong with it! 
Nothing at all!

333
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,916
So the computer is needed, right? 
-Yes! Very much so!

334
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:14,666
Come, sis! 
I'll request the computer be given to you!

335
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:16,541
Silence! 
Move slowly.

336
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:17,666
Don't push me, fatty!

337
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:22,500
Don't be afraid, sis. 
Come along!

338
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:25,250
Move aside, all of you!

339
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:26,750
I'll go wake him up, sis!

340
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:32,166
Hey! 
Stop!

341
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:34,458
It's nothing, 'mama'.

342
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:35,833
Just a small doubt...

343
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:38,458
What? Is it if two plus three 
equals four or five?

344
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,666
No...

345
00:24:40,791 --> 00:24:44,208
They've stated the value of 'x' as two 
and that of 'y' as three.

346
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:49,708
How do I substitute the value of 'x' 
in this equation? Please teach me, 'mama'.

347
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:11,458
What is that, 'mama'?

348
00:25:12,166 --> 00:25:13,166
A hyperbola curve!

349
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:20,250
That's a circle, right?

350
00:25:21,625 --> 00:25:22,833
No. 
It's the centre.

351
00:25:25,458 --> 00:25:26,458
What is 'ae'?

352
00:25:27,916 --> 00:25:29,500
Asked you what 'ae' is, 
in math.

353
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,583
That which is between length and breadth, 
right?

354
00:25:33,708 --> 00:25:35,333
State board, huh?

355
00:25:35,458 --> 00:25:37,041
Didn't study, eh?

356
00:25:37,166 --> 00:25:38,250
Don't study!

357
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:39,875
Why must girls study?

358
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,708
When a guy studies day and night 
and acquires a well-paying job...

359
00:25:44,833 --> 00:25:48,208
...you folk casually end up marrying him 
and through his hard work...

360
00:25:48,333 --> 00:25:51,083
...you'll chill throughout life! 
Isn't that right?

361
00:25:55,791 --> 00:25:56,958
Wait.

362
00:25:57,083 --> 00:25:59,416
What happened yesterday 
while travelling with me?

363
00:25:59,541 --> 00:26:01,000
What do you mean, 'mama'?

364
00:26:01,125 --> 00:26:03,125
Don't play dumb with me.

365
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,666
We came upon a speed breaker.

366
00:26:05,583 --> 00:26:08,291
I pulled on the brake. 
The bike jumped up a bit.

367
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:10,583
Then, you leaned upon me.

368
00:26:12,416 --> 00:26:14,000
Your chest collided with my back.

369
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:17,083
Your breath was pretty scorching, too.

370
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:18,333
And you know it, too.

371
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,208
But, you didn't move at all.

372
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:24,250
You remained in place. 
Your heartbeat was pretty fast, too.

373
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,958
That means you felt something!

374
00:26:44,125 --> 00:26:47,291
As I am mature, 
thankfully nothing came of it.

375
00:26:47,416 --> 00:26:50,666
Had anyone else been in my place, 
they would've taken undue advantage.

376
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:52,833
Get going.

377
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:55,750
Hold it right there.

378
00:26:56,958 --> 00:26:59,000
Did you eat chicken? 
-No!

379
00:27:00,625 --> 00:27:01,833
Give me your hand!

380
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:05,500
Kids shouldn't be watching this! 
Run along and study!

381
00:27:08,041 --> 00:27:09,041
Run along.

382
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,375
Here's what I understand from this.

383
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,750
What's that?

384
00:27:14,875 --> 00:27:17,375
From now, we must never send her 
to Balu's room alone!

385
00:27:38,708 --> 00:27:40,583
Grandma!

386
00:27:40,708 --> 00:27:42,708
What is it, dear? 
What happened?

387
00:27:42,833 --> 00:27:45,875
I'll fail in this examination, grandma!

388
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,625
I couldn't understand anything!

389
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:50,208
You're crying over this! 
Stop! Wipe those tears!

390
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:53,583
No, grandma. 
Send me back home!

391
00:27:53,708 --> 00:27:54,791
You lunatic!

392
00:27:54,916 --> 00:27:55,916
I'll go home!

393
00:27:57,166 --> 00:27:58,166
Aunty!

394
00:27:58,291 --> 00:28:00,583
What is it, dear? 
Why are you crying?

395
00:28:00,708 --> 00:28:01,708
Tell me what's wrong.

396
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:04,625
I don't understand anything 
that is taught here!

397
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,416
Everything is taught in English!

398
00:28:06,541 --> 00:28:07,833
Would anyone cry over this?

399
00:28:07,958 --> 00:28:10,291
I won't be able to pass! 
-Don't worry!

400
00:28:10,416 --> 00:28:13,041
You'll be able to learn it. 
I'll teach you. Don't cry!

401
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:15,250
What is it, dear?

402
00:28:15,375 --> 00:28:17,458
I'll flunk in this examination, uncle!

403
00:28:17,583 --> 00:28:19,000
Is that all this fuss is about?

404
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:21,750
I don't understand anything 
that is taught here!

405
00:28:21,875 --> 00:28:25,416
Listen. Do you know how much 
I fought with your dad to bring you here?

406
00:28:26,583 --> 00:28:28,083
You must not cry, okay?

407
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:30,708
No, uncle! 
I'll fail this exam!

408
00:28:31,541 --> 00:28:33,208
Look what I've brought for you!

409
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:41,291
Even so, I'll go back home!

410
00:28:41,416 --> 00:28:43,041
O dear chicken!

411
00:28:44,708 --> 00:28:46,208
I'll flunk!

412
00:28:47,416 --> 00:28:50,291
You really like this, right? 
-I don't understand any of this!

413
00:28:50,416 --> 00:28:52,833
I'm leaving! 
Please drop me back to my hometown!

414
00:28:55,291 --> 00:28:57,083
I don't know how to console you.

415
00:28:58,083 --> 00:29:01,750
Because, I can't imagine the pain 
of those who flunk.

416
00:29:01,875 --> 00:29:04,166
Because, I've never flunked an exam yet!

417
00:29:05,875 --> 00:29:08,166
You were babbling on and on 
about going home?

418
00:29:08,291 --> 00:29:10,541
Is this a motel 
for you to come and go as you please?

419
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:13,708
Anyone who does not study, 
will only fail!

420
00:29:13,833 --> 00:29:15,458
Think you'll pass if you cry?

421
00:29:17,708 --> 00:29:19,166
Just try studying once!

422
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:21,416
I'll even help you out!

423
00:29:22,458 --> 00:29:25,666
If you fail even after that, 
I'll drop you home myself!

424
00:29:25,791 --> 00:29:27,958
How many times have we failed?

425
00:29:28,083 --> 00:29:29,666
You can drop us home, right?

426
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,208
This is my 'Arjuna' timetable.

427
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:37,833
Since I'm brilliant, 
studying an hour per day is sufficient.

428
00:29:37,958 --> 00:29:40,958
If I study for an hour, 
you must study for five.

429
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,708
Here. 
These are my books.

430
00:29:46,958 --> 00:29:48,458
If you have any doubts, 
ask me.

431
00:29:48,583 --> 00:29:49,833
'O revered Ganesha...'

432
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:54,291
'The one with fiery eyes...'

433
00:29:56,833 --> 00:30:01,333
'Poetry and red flowers offered, 
only to praise thou!'

434
00:30:01,458 --> 00:30:05,708
'Honey and millets, 
for thou to feast!'

435
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,250
'Gently cast thine eyes upon us!'

436
00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:23,166
'Thou art the mighty Lord, 
as inscribed in the scriptures!'

437
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,333
'Leave us at ease 
with your grace!'

438
00:30:28,458 --> 00:30:32,791
'O benevolent one, 
who gives boons to our extended hands!'

439
00:30:32,916 --> 00:30:37,166
'O omnipotent one, 
who protects us from within!'

440
00:30:37,291 --> 00:30:41,916
'O caregiver, 
who releases our burdens and unites us!'

441
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:46,375
'O protector, 
who dispels miseries and lights up life!'

442
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,875
'O caretaker, 
who bestows good and detaches burden!'

443
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,166
'Gently cast thine eyes upon us!'

444
00:30:55,291 --> 00:30:59,750
'Thou art the mighty Lord, 
as mentioned in the scriptures!'

445
00:31:08,916 --> 00:31:13,458
'A centum score, I do not seek!'

446
00:31:13,583 --> 00:31:17,791
'Please help me just to pass this test!'

447
00:31:17,916 --> 00:31:22,333
'The IQ of a scientist, I do not want!'

448
00:31:22,458 --> 00:31:26,875
'Should thy look to give it, 
do so quickly!'

449
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,208
'The high marks 
that puts my face on a banner...'

450
00:31:31,333 --> 00:31:35,750
'...I do not want.'

451
00:31:35,875 --> 00:31:39,916
'A last bencher, I am!'

452
00:31:40,041 --> 00:31:44,875
'Help me just a bit to do little better!'

453
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,708
'O revered Ganesha...'

454
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,291
'The one with fiery eyes...'

455
00:31:53,791 --> 00:31:58,416
'Poetry and red flowers offered, 
only to praise thou!'

456
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:02,833
'Honey and millets, 
for thou to feast!'

457
00:32:07,291 --> 00:32:08,875
She must have definitely flunked!

458
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:11,250
She would've passed!

459
00:32:12,208 --> 00:32:13,791
As she expected, she didn't flunk.

460
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:16,208
As you expected, she didn't pass.

461
00:32:16,333 --> 00:32:17,500
Then what happened?

462
00:32:17,625 --> 00:32:18,708
I had a dream.

463
00:32:26,416 --> 00:32:29,166
A hilarious thing happened yesterday, 
Maha!

464
00:32:29,291 --> 00:32:30,625
What was it?

465
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,958
I had a dream 
where you were the first ranker!

466
00:32:33,083 --> 00:32:36,125
Everyone was congratulating you!

467
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:38,333
I couldn't stop laughing!

468
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:40,833
The result is out, Balu!

469
00:32:40,958 --> 00:32:42,375
Who's the second ranker? 
-You!

470
00:32:42,875 --> 00:32:44,875
'Mama' is second rank? 
-What are you saying?

471
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Yes, man!

472
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,125
What about the treat, Balu?

473
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:56,750
Why must I give a treat?

474
00:32:56,875 --> 00:32:59,625
The second ranker must give a treat, right? 
That's the rule!

475
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,208
Give out your orders, guys!

476
00:33:01,333 --> 00:33:04,791
One cold coffee, one Pepsi, 
a sandwich, an ice cream, a 'lassi', bro!

477
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:16,583
For the longest time, I wished to give 
a female name to this block.

478
00:33:16,708 --> 00:33:18,375
You've fulfilled my wish!

479
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,916
It's like the Goddess of wealth herself 
has come down upon us!

480
00:33:34,333 --> 00:33:37,541
For the longest time, 
I wanted a party from Balu.

481
00:33:37,666 --> 00:33:39,583
Today, that wish has been fulfilled, too!

482
00:33:41,041 --> 00:33:43,458
I was just kidding 
about wanting a party!

483
00:33:43,583 --> 00:33:45,458
But, you fulfilled it anyway!

484
00:33:45,583 --> 00:33:47,291
Do I mean that much to you?

485
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:49,083
Move aside!

486
00:33:51,083 --> 00:33:52,208
It's okay. 
He likes me!

487
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:57,291
A love letter, 'mama'.

488
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,375
Did Roja give it?

489
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,291
She can't just take a hint, can she?

490
00:34:01,416 --> 00:34:03,000
Not for you, 'mama'! 
It's for me.

491
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:05,041
For you? 
Who gave it?

492
00:34:05,583 --> 00:34:06,583
Over there.

493
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,333
Oh no! Thought he wouldn't come, 
but here he is!

494
00:34:11,458 --> 00:34:14,375
How dare you give a love letter 
to my cousin?

495
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,625
Get lost!

496
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:17,333
It wasn't me. He did it! 
-Beat it!

497
00:34:17,458 --> 00:34:20,458
He's hitting you, right? 
Don't just stand there! Moron!

498
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:22,625
Get on!

499
00:34:30,166 --> 00:34:31,166
Damn it!

500
00:34:32,166 --> 00:34:34,166
Would you accept a love letter from anyone?

501
00:34:34,291 --> 00:34:36,000
Mustn't you slap him right there?

502
00:34:36,708 --> 00:34:39,833
Good grief! Taking care of her 
is a big enough task for me!

503
00:34:39,958 --> 00:34:41,875
Am I her watchman?

504
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,166
If anything happens to her, 
who is responsible?

505
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:46,541
Heard that Mahalakshmi came first in class!

506
00:34:46,666 --> 00:34:49,875
I'm very happy! I'm making chicken 
for my sweetheart, tonight!

507
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,541
What bloody first in class?

508
00:34:51,666 --> 00:34:55,250
Someone gave her a love letter! 
Ignoring that, you talk about this?

509
00:34:55,375 --> 00:34:57,250
Listen up! 
Anyone can be a topper!

510
00:34:57,375 --> 00:34:59,875
But, is that important? 
One's character is important!

511
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,250
Don't you know that? 
-What are you babbling about?

512
00:35:02,375 --> 00:35:05,625
Hey kiddo, 
Mahalakshmi came first in class, huh?

513
00:35:06,875 --> 00:35:07,875
Yes, she did.

514
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,875
Who taught her the subject matter? 
I did, right?

515
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,041
How could she not top the class 
after that?

516
00:35:13,166 --> 00:35:16,250
To improve her confidence level, 
I didn't write the exam properly.

517
00:35:16,375 --> 00:35:19,291
What? You didn't write many exams 
in college well?

518
00:35:20,125 --> 00:35:21,458
Grandma? 
-Yes?

519
00:35:21,583 --> 00:35:24,000
Some schmuck gave your granddaughter 
a love letter.

520
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:26,125
Aren't you ashamed? 
-Oh stop!

521
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:29,208
No way it can beat the love letters 
I received by the ton in my youth!

522
00:35:30,083 --> 00:35:32,000
Nobody cares about a damn thing!

523
00:35:32,125 --> 00:35:33,333
Why should I do so?

524
00:35:33,458 --> 00:35:35,000
Do what you wish!

525
00:35:38,041 --> 00:35:39,708
Why are you getting so worked up?

526
00:35:40,833 --> 00:35:43,875
Is it because I got a love letter 
or that I came first in class?

527
00:35:45,416 --> 00:35:48,208
Seems like something's burning. 
Have your soda pop.

528
00:36:39,625 --> 00:36:40,625
Want some?

529
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:49,458
Who was that guy who said 
eating chicken is bad for the brain?

530
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:52,041
It was some brainless guy. 
Never mind him!

531
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:08,416
What? 
Password required?

532
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,583
Dad! 
-What is it?

533
00:37:11,708 --> 00:37:14,083
Who changed my system's password? 
-Mahalakshmi.

534
00:37:14,208 --> 00:37:15,875
Mahalakshmi? 
-Yes.

535
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,583
Why did she do that? 
-Hey!

536
00:37:17,708 --> 00:37:20,666
Didn't you say that whoever ranks first 
gets to use the computer?

537
00:37:21,916 --> 00:37:25,083
As you were ranked second, 
the computer would go to her, right?

538
00:37:25,208 --> 00:37:26,750
I'll deal with this! 
-Maha!

539
00:37:26,875 --> 00:37:30,208
Yes, uncle? 
-Please give him his computerâ€™s password.

540
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:32,166
Now it is my computer, uncle!

541
00:37:34,916 --> 00:37:36,916
Poor chap. 
Please tell him the password.

542
00:37:37,041 --> 00:37:40,291
Passwords can't be disclosed in public! 
It won't be secret anymore!

543
00:37:40,416 --> 00:37:43,083
I'll eat this chicken piece 
and open it for him myself.

544
00:37:43,208 --> 00:37:44,375
That won't be necessary!

545
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:48,083
Besides 'Chicken 65', 
what else would you care about?

546
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:50,625
I'll handle it myself! 
-Okay.

547
00:37:51,625 --> 00:37:53,875
He wasn't scolding you, 
but the 'Chicken 65'.

548
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,041
Don't be upset!

549
00:38:03,125 --> 00:38:05,166
What are you all doing here? 
Go and sleep!

550
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:08,500
Hurry up, fatty! 
Else, he'll rip you to pieces!

551
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,083
You mini-eggplant! 
What did you set as the password?

552
00:38:15,583 --> 00:38:16,583
I can't figure it out!

553
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,625
Let's try this.

554
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:33,458
Wrong password again? 
Good grief!

555
00:38:34,458 --> 00:38:37,500
My eyelids are getting a tad heavy...

556
00:38:37,625 --> 00:38:39,416
Don't fall asleep, Balu!

557
00:38:39,541 --> 00:38:41,083
Don't fall asleep!

558
00:39:12,291 --> 00:39:14,583
"My goodness! 
You're really hot!"

559
00:39:14,708 --> 00:39:16,125
Mahalakshmi is 'hot'?

560
00:39:19,916 --> 00:39:23,833
"With such a beautiful girl by his side, 
how is Balu able to study?"

561
00:39:23,958 --> 00:39:27,125
"Have him clean his glasses first 
and then take a look at you."

562
00:39:34,791 --> 00:39:36,875
"God damn! 
What a lovely hip!"

563
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,791
"I could stare at that hip 
all semester long!"

564
00:39:41,291 --> 00:39:45,458
"Only upon looking at your hip, 
would they have discovered the circle!"

565
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:50,291
"Or hell, they would've modeled the moon 
in the sky off of you!"

566
00:39:50,416 --> 00:39:53,541
"Also, I think the number zero 
was invented..."

567
00:39:53,666 --> 00:39:55,750
"...only to measure your waist!"

568
00:39:55,875 --> 00:39:58,208
"You've made me understand 
such lovely mysteries!"

569
00:39:58,333 --> 00:40:00,750
"Yours truly, 
your dear lover."

570
00:41:15,291 --> 00:41:17,625
Oh no! 
Aunty!

571
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:19,958
Didn't mean to! I'm sorry! 
-Aunty!

572
00:41:20,083 --> 00:41:21,833
Oh dear! 
-Aunty!

573
00:41:21,958 --> 00:41:24,666
I came to be with two feet. 
She reduced me to all fours!

574
00:41:24,791 --> 00:41:27,291
Oh no! She's knocking! 
-Open the door, aunty!

575
00:41:27,416 --> 00:41:29,916
All because of this damn hand! 
-Please open the door!

576
00:41:30,041 --> 00:41:31,458
Mom! 
-What happened, dear?

577
00:41:31,583 --> 00:41:32,708
It is...

578
00:41:32,833 --> 00:41:35,041
Please don't say it! 
Pretty please!

579
00:41:35,166 --> 00:41:36,833
It's... 
-What happened? Tell me.

580
00:41:38,916 --> 00:41:40,166
It is...

581
00:41:40,291 --> 00:41:42,041
No... it is...

582
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,666
What's wrong? 
What is 'it'?

583
00:41:43,791 --> 00:41:46,458
Please help me, God!

584
00:41:46,583 --> 00:41:47,916
My head aches, aunty.

585
00:41:48,041 --> 00:41:51,208
Please give me some 'Zandu Balm'. 
-Is that all it is? Hold on.

586
00:42:16,291 --> 00:42:18,625
Because I am mature, 
it's all good, 'mama'.

587
00:42:19,458 --> 00:42:21,083
If not, what would've become of you?

588
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:24,958
This isn't for me. 
It's for you!

589
00:42:46,916 --> 00:42:50,750
'That is Mahalakshmi!'

590
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:09,958
'Quite the decisive victory, 
she has scored indeed!'

591
00:43:10,083 --> 00:43:13,833
'She turned the King of Kings 
into King Kong!'

592
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:17,625
'With a single leap, 
she overtook him!'

593
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:21,458
'Overnight, she became a wonder woman!'

594
00:43:21,583 --> 00:43:25,333
'If two minuses equal a plus, 
two pluses equal minus!'

595
00:43:25,458 --> 00:43:28,916
'She changed that equation 
and went straight to the top!'

596
00:43:51,041 --> 00:43:52,041
Stop it, guys!

597
00:43:52,666 --> 00:43:56,375
He's bearing his soul with a heavy heart 
and you're all praising his cousin?

598
00:43:57,875 --> 00:44:00,083
Here you go, bro. 
Hold it and drink up!

599
00:44:00,208 --> 00:44:01,833
Once this is in, 
all else will be out.

600
00:44:03,333 --> 00:44:05,750
Shall I give you an idea 
to become class topper?

601
00:44:05,875 --> 00:44:07,875
Imbecile! 
What he's saying is a flashback!

602
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,250
How can you swoop in and give pointers? 
-That's exactly why I'm doing so!

603
00:44:12,041 --> 00:44:13,541
Go ahead, my dear. 
Go ahead.

604
00:44:15,291 --> 00:44:17,541
You start from the beginning, bro.

605
00:44:17,666 --> 00:44:19,791
But, do so in a way 
where you are the topper!

606
00:44:21,541 --> 00:44:22,875
Who the hell let you in here?

607
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:24,500
Give me that!

608
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:26,250
Here you go, bro.

609
00:44:26,375 --> 00:44:28,291
Pour your heart out 
after pouring this in.

610
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,875
Doesn't Tendulkar himself 
score zero at times? Don't feel bad.

611
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,708
What if he ends with a zero once again?

612
00:44:33,833 --> 00:44:35,166
That was my fear, too.

613
00:44:35,291 --> 00:44:37,958
In order to be a topper, 
I went straight to a KFC restaurant.

614
00:44:39,416 --> 00:44:41,000
Bought a full bucket of chicken.

615
00:44:42,208 --> 00:44:43,291
I ate one leg piece.

616
00:44:44,625 --> 00:44:45,750
Two ideas came about.

617
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:59,750
'Jealous of the cat, 
turned the giant elephant!'

618
00:45:06,333 --> 00:45:09,458
'Google and Yahoo in a big, big fight!' 
-I'm going to the playground!

619
00:45:12,708 --> 00:45:15,750
'Rather than relying on courage to win...'

620
00:45:15,875 --> 00:45:18,916
'...he resorted to trickery!'

621
00:45:19,041 --> 00:45:22,041
'Became a real trickster, he did!'

622
00:45:22,166 --> 00:45:25,458
'He indulged in fraudulence 
day and night!'

623
00:45:25,583 --> 00:45:28,625
'He makes the tension meter soar!'

624
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:31,750
'He tortures like a speed breaker!'

625
00:45:31,875 --> 00:45:34,958
'Without counting, he creates confusion!'

626
00:45:35,083 --> 00:45:38,125
'Without a reprieve, 
he raises the blood pressure!'

627
00:45:54,333 --> 00:45:57,291
'His acting cannot be endured!'

628
00:45:57,416 --> 00:46:00,583
'His cheating couldn't be tolerated!'

629
00:46:00,708 --> 00:46:03,708
'His fights haven't changed!'

630
00:46:03,833 --> 00:46:06,958
'His strategic planning 
shows no signs of retreat!'

631
00:46:07,083 --> 00:46:10,208
'He crafted a meticulous timetable!'

632
00:46:10,333 --> 00:46:13,333
'Like a needle in a clock, 
he runs without a moment's rest!'

633
00:46:13,458 --> 00:46:16,583
'Cheating! 
The fire nears the cotton!'

634
00:46:16,708 --> 00:46:19,750
'Cheating! 
The tiger nears the deer!'

635
00:46:19,875 --> 00:46:22,916
'Cheating! 
The storm nears the flower!'

636
00:46:23,041 --> 00:46:26,375
'Cheating! 
The sky nears the handkerchief!'

637
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:37,291
You idiot! 
Why are you pouring rice on the floor?

638
00:46:37,416 --> 00:46:39,125
Why are you infuriating me, ma'am?

639
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:41,333
Lot of ghosts roam about at night here!

640
00:46:41,458 --> 00:46:43,208
Ghosts normally come in darkness, right?

641
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:45,333
But this one seems to wield a firebrand!

642
00:46:45,458 --> 00:46:46,666
It comes with a light!

643
00:46:46,791 --> 00:46:48,791
Yes! 
Now I understand, too!

644
00:46:48,916 --> 00:46:51,583
What is that? 
-My alarm time changes by itself!

645
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:53,375
My books go missing!

646
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:55,958
When I go to the bathroom, 
the door locks itself!

647
00:46:56,083 --> 00:46:58,416
I can't even open this damn ring!

648
00:46:58,541 --> 00:47:00,750
Yes, mom. 
The same thing happens to me!

649
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Come closer.

650
00:47:03,791 --> 00:47:05,666
Why are your eyes white like that a ghost?

651
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:10,541
If a ghost roams about the house 
all night, who can sleep peacefully?

652
00:47:11,708 --> 00:47:14,458
Am I not scared of ghosts, too? 
-Absolutely.

653
00:47:14,583 --> 00:47:16,583
I'm going, dad. 
To sleep peacefully!

654
00:47:17,416 --> 00:47:19,666
Mop! 
Pour some rice in my room, too!

655
00:47:19,791 --> 00:47:20,791
You got it!

656
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:27,000
All of this is for you. 
Eat well!

657
00:47:27,125 --> 00:47:28,875
Oh no! 
Aunty, it's Saturday!

658
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,125
My goodness! 
Now what do we do?

659
00:47:42,625 --> 00:47:45,041
Saturday has transitioned into Sunday!

660
00:47:45,166 --> 00:47:46,583
Therefore, I can eat chicken!

661
00:47:59,541 --> 00:48:01,541
It smells like someone is studying in here!

662
00:48:13,125 --> 00:48:15,291
So 'mama' is the firebrand wielding spirit?

663
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,166
The ghost, huh?

664
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Got scared thinking it was Mahalakshmi!

665
00:48:31,666 --> 00:48:34,500
So he's been studying every night 
without your knowledge.

666
00:48:34,625 --> 00:48:36,250
In the guise of a ghost, no less!

667
00:48:37,083 --> 00:48:39,333
He's playing a major cheating card!

668
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:42,041
Do not forget this 
as long as you live, sis!

669
00:48:42,166 --> 00:48:44,416
Fortunately, 
that chicken piece saved you.

670
00:48:44,541 --> 00:48:47,875
It isn't wrong if you a build a temple 
for that chicken piece!

671
00:48:48,708 --> 00:48:52,583
For memory power, 
he eats Saraswati holy paste!

672
00:48:53,583 --> 00:48:55,541
So it's not by his own brain, eh?

673
00:48:56,541 --> 00:48:59,000
I thought he was genius.

674
00:48:59,125 --> 00:49:01,416
But, he's nothing but a doofus!

675
00:49:01,541 --> 00:49:03,291
Order ten boxes of that stuff for us!

676
00:49:04,791 --> 00:49:07,041
You guys have no idea how to study.

677
00:49:07,166 --> 00:49:10,041
But, don't you at least have a way 
to ruin someone's studies?

678
00:49:10,916 --> 00:49:13,708
After this, you must not spare him, sis!

679
00:49:13,833 --> 00:49:15,125
You must disturb him!

680
00:49:16,125 --> 00:49:20,791
You must disturb him in a way 
that no one can even imagine!

681
00:49:21,791 --> 00:49:23,333
Do you get what I'm saying?

682
00:49:23,458 --> 00:49:24,791
What are you saying?

683
00:49:24,916 --> 00:49:27,291
Balu must be infatuated!

684
00:49:43,125 --> 00:49:44,125
Grandma!

685
00:49:45,833 --> 00:49:47,666
Look at what she's doing to distract me!

686
00:49:48,375 --> 00:49:49,791
She's not letting me study!

687
00:49:49,916 --> 00:49:51,250
She's just a kid, man!

688
00:49:51,375 --> 00:49:54,041
Her? A kid? 
She's exposing herself!

689
00:49:54,166 --> 00:49:55,166
Stop blabbing!

690
00:49:59,375 --> 00:50:02,041
'A war has broken out 
between the cat and the rat!'

691
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:05,166
I'm going to play! 
-Aunty! I'm going for badminton!

692
00:50:08,833 --> 00:50:12,000
'The fights and quarrels 
shall never cease!'

693
00:50:12,125 --> 00:50:15,375
'The spider has trapped the tiger 
with ease!'

694
00:50:21,708 --> 00:50:27,916
'She has removed a thorn with a thorn. 
She has extinguished fire with fire!'

695
00:50:28,041 --> 00:50:31,166
'A mirror effect, she has exuded!'

696
00:50:31,291 --> 00:50:34,583
'A glass of water 
has turned into a tsunami!'

697
00:50:34,708 --> 00:50:37,666
'She trapped him 
with his own tricks!'

698
00:50:37,791 --> 00:50:40,833
'Without much ado, 
she has crushed you-know-who!'

699
00:50:40,958 --> 00:50:44,041
'She enjoyed playing tit for tat!'

700
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:47,458
'She relished making him slip and fall! 
What a gal!'

701
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,083
Pipe down, guys!

702
00:51:27,208 --> 00:51:29,166
I'm confused enough 
as to who came first!

703
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:32,250
Who was the topper? 
Tell us, bro!

704
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Why are you late?

705
00:51:40,125 --> 00:51:41,750
Results are out today, right?

706
00:51:41,875 --> 00:51:44,333
So, I went to seek grandma's blessings.

707
00:51:44,458 --> 00:51:47,291
Because I got her blessings last time, 
I came first.

708
00:51:47,416 --> 00:51:48,916
A little sentimental touch.

709
00:51:49,041 --> 00:51:50,041
Okay, now get on.

710
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:54,625
Maybe grandma's blessings 
do have a lot of divine power!

711
00:51:55,625 --> 00:51:57,916
Why risk it? 
Let me take a shot.

712
00:51:58,041 --> 00:52:00,000
Hey! 
Hold on to the bike.

713
00:52:00,125 --> 00:52:02,625
Hold it quickly. 
I'll be back in a minute.

714
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:04,166
Hold on. I'll be right back!

715
00:52:12,875 --> 00:52:14,333
No one's around.

716
00:52:14,458 --> 00:52:15,458
Where are her feet?

717
00:52:26,416 --> 00:52:27,875
Dad!

718
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,500
Hey sweetheart! 
Are you well?

719
00:52:30,625 --> 00:52:32,250
Get the luggage!

720
00:52:32,375 --> 00:52:33,916
Welcome, uncle! 
How are you?

721
00:52:34,041 --> 00:52:36,125
I'm good. How about you, Balu? 
-I'm fine.

722
00:52:37,125 --> 00:52:38,583
Have some coffee. 
-Sure!

723
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:43,875
Quite the surprise visit, brother. 
What's the occasion?

724
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,541
All good news, dear.

725
00:52:45,666 --> 00:52:49,000
I'm looking to get Mahalakshmi married 
sometime soon.

726
00:52:49,125 --> 00:52:50,750
Marriage for Mahalakshmi?

727
00:52:50,875 --> 00:52:52,333
What's the rush for that?

728
00:52:52,458 --> 00:52:54,833
The thing is, 
a good alliance has come by.

729
00:52:54,958 --> 00:52:57,041
The groom is excellent. 
He stays here, too!

730
00:52:57,166 --> 00:52:59,208
They didn't ask for dowry, either.

731
00:52:59,333 --> 00:53:02,666
The father of the groom 
has seen Maha somewhere.

732
00:53:02,791 --> 00:53:05,625
He was very impressed. 
He wanted to finish the wedding soon...

733
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:08,166
...and take her with them to America.

734
00:53:08,291 --> 00:53:10,458
You're absolutely right, uncle!

735
00:53:10,583 --> 00:53:12,166
Do not delay!

736
00:53:12,291 --> 00:53:15,125
Keeping an eye on her every day at college 
is quite the chore!

737
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:17,041
She gets so many love letters!

738
00:53:17,166 --> 00:53:19,375
The entire college 
is head over heels with her!

739
00:53:20,083 --> 00:53:22,000
I know she'd go to America 
after marriage.

740
00:53:22,875 --> 00:53:24,708
If not, who knows where she'll go...

741
00:53:25,541 --> 00:53:27,958
Stop this needless blubbering!

742
00:53:29,125 --> 00:53:30,333
Excuse me, son-in-law...

743
00:53:30,458 --> 00:53:32,375
Don't misunderstand me.

744
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,625
Poor motherless girl.

745
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:37,000
My son brought her here from afar 
so that she'll have a good education.

746
00:53:37,125 --> 00:53:39,291
At this time, why rush to marry her off?

747
00:53:40,291 --> 00:53:42,916
Please wait a while. 
Let her finish studying.

748
00:53:43,041 --> 00:53:45,916
After that, I'll find a good alliance 
and get her married.

749
00:53:46,041 --> 00:53:47,791
She's a girl child, right?

750
00:53:47,916 --> 00:53:50,291
What is she going to do 
after studying beyond this?

751
00:53:50,416 --> 00:53:52,708
There is a lot of difference...

752
00:53:52,833 --> 00:53:55,958
...between your desires and my desires 
for her marriage.

753
00:53:56,083 --> 00:53:59,416
What you said right now, 
is totally and completely accurate!

754
00:53:59,541 --> 00:54:01,375
Girls must not be allowed to study a lot!

755
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:04,083
If done so, 
their husbands would end up hating them!

756
00:54:04,208 --> 00:54:06,416
Chances are they might desert them, too!

757
00:54:06,541 --> 00:54:08,250
Like how grandpa left grandma!

758
00:54:08,375 --> 00:54:09,375
Shut your damn mouth!

759
00:54:10,416 --> 00:54:12,000
Your grandpa didn't leave me.

760
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,333
I was the one who pushed him away!

761
00:54:15,458 --> 00:54:18,041
All these years, 
without expecting anyone's help...

762
00:54:18,166 --> 00:54:21,500
...I stood on my own two feet 
and raised all of you...

763
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:23,916
...and brought you all 
to a respectable standing!

764
00:54:27,458 --> 00:54:29,458
Tell your son to watch his tongue!

765
00:54:30,875 --> 00:54:32,041
Can't you be quiet?

766
00:54:33,541 --> 00:54:34,875
I'll take your leave.

767
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,500
Alright, brother. 
But anyway, think this over.

768
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:40,250
Dad!

769
00:54:43,916 --> 00:54:46,541
That boy wishes to meet you in person.

770
00:54:46,666 --> 00:54:49,708
He'll meet you in your college campus 
on Monday.

771
00:54:49,833 --> 00:54:50,833
Take care, dear.

772
00:54:51,958 --> 00:54:54,416
Hey Hema! 
Why bother studying hard?

773
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:57,875
Some guy has already been born, 
has studied hard, will get a great job...

774
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,833
...earn a lot of money 
and seek your hand in marriage!

775
00:55:00,958 --> 00:55:03,083
Why bother studying hard? 
-'Mama'!

776
00:55:03,208 --> 00:55:04,666
Take Mahalakshmi for example!

777
00:55:04,791 --> 00:55:07,125
As I said, without any hassle, 
she will get married!

778
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:08,500
Her wedding's next month!

779
00:55:08,625 --> 00:55:10,708
Rather than wasting time 
with studying...

780
00:55:10,833 --> 00:55:12,666
...you ladies hit the gym 
and lose weight!

781
00:55:12,791 --> 00:55:15,791
Why are we guys around? 
To protect folk like you, right?

782
00:55:15,916 --> 00:55:17,125
Quit worrying!

783
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:20,333
Listen to me, 'mama'! 
I don't want to get married!

784
00:55:20,458 --> 00:55:22,166
Don't tell anyone about this!

785
00:55:22,291 --> 00:55:23,625
This time, I'm coming first!

786
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:25,875
Not just this time, 
but every time from now!

787
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,541
'Cause, you're getting married!

788
00:55:28,208 --> 00:55:30,333
What gives, 'Result' Kumar? 
Why so glum?

789
00:55:30,458 --> 00:55:32,125
The results are out? 
-Yes.

790
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:33,833
It has? 
-Mahalakshmi...

791
00:55:33,958 --> 00:55:35,166
What's her score?

792
00:55:35,291 --> 00:55:36,375
She scored 95%.

793
00:55:37,916 --> 00:55:39,125
What about me?

794
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:40,291
You scored 96%.

795
00:55:41,375 --> 00:55:43,500
I knew it! 
Knew I'd come first!

796
00:55:43,625 --> 00:55:46,500
Guys! This time, 
the first ranker will give a treat!

797
00:55:46,625 --> 00:55:48,875
Eat whatever you want! 
It's on me!

798
00:55:56,041 --> 00:55:57,041
Sorry, buddy.

799
00:55:58,041 --> 00:55:59,041
Ajay's the topper.

800
00:55:59,583 --> 00:56:00,708
He scored 97%.

801
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:07,125
To name the block, I was yearning sadly 
for someone whose name started with 'A'.

802
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:08,875
You've crushed my unhappiness!

803
00:56:19,958 --> 00:56:21,000
Our dear Balu, sir!

804
00:56:26,458 --> 00:56:29,083
I'll do it! 
If second rankers always give parties...

805
00:56:29,208 --> 00:56:31,083
...their family fortune won't cover it!

806
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:35,000
Here on in, no more parties. 
Just studies!

807
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:36,541
The final exams are coming!

808
00:56:36,666 --> 00:56:38,750
Whoever comes first in the final exam...

809
00:56:38,875 --> 00:56:41,708
...their name will be set 
as the permanent name of this block!

810
00:56:41,833 --> 00:56:46,000
It could be Balu or Mahalakshmi 
or even Ajay! Okay?

811
00:56:46,125 --> 00:56:48,041
If so, name it after me right away!

812
00:57:04,583 --> 00:57:07,333
Listen up. 
The topper must be either you or me.

813
00:57:07,458 --> 00:57:09,416
We mustn't let anyone else get there! 
Okay?

814
00:57:10,625 --> 00:57:12,541
Mission two. 
We mustn't let Ajay study!

815
00:57:13,416 --> 00:57:15,541
Mission one. 
Stop my wedding!

816
00:57:15,666 --> 00:57:16,833
If so, I have a condition.

817
00:57:17,541 --> 00:57:18,625
I have a condition, too.

818
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:20,291
Never say "That is Mahalakshmi!"

819
00:57:20,416 --> 00:57:22,291
Never ask me for your computer password!

820
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,125
I'm weak in embedded systems, 'mama'!

821
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:29,750
I know. 
I'll help you.

822
00:57:29,875 --> 00:57:31,833
You're weak in virtual reality, 'mama'!

823
00:57:31,958 --> 00:57:34,166
I know you'll help me with it.

824
00:57:34,291 --> 00:57:36,625
What if we start fighting 
and end up not talking?

825
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:38,166
Who must talk first?

826
00:57:40,583 --> 00:57:42,041
Let's flip for it!

827
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:44,166
Heads, you talk first.

828
00:57:44,291 --> 00:57:45,916
Tails, I'll talk first.

829
00:57:46,041 --> 00:57:48,708
No can do. 
Heads for you. Tails for me.

830
00:57:48,833 --> 00:57:50,583
No way! 
-Then I can't, either!

831
00:57:54,833 --> 00:57:58,000
To decide who is heads and who is tails, 
let's flip for it now.

832
00:57:58,125 --> 00:58:01,041
Alright. If heads, your tails. 
If tails, I'm heads.

833
00:58:06,291 --> 00:58:07,333
Lovely!

834
00:58:08,375 --> 00:58:11,333
'Will she come to rock my world?'

835
00:58:12,333 --> 00:58:14,000
He's here, buddy. I'll handle it.

836
00:58:15,166 --> 00:58:16,166
Mahalakshmi, huh?

837
00:58:16,291 --> 00:58:18,458
She was with me at the pub 
until 2 AM last night!

838
00:58:18,583 --> 00:58:19,666
She drinks hard!

839
00:58:19,791 --> 00:58:21,583
She drinks 7-Up? 
-I'll smash your face!

840
00:58:21,708 --> 00:58:24,541
Cocktail, man! 
-The heady mix of spirits in a bowl, yes?

841
00:58:26,208 --> 00:58:29,041
She drank way too much last night. 
So I had Sandy drop her home.

842
00:58:29,166 --> 00:58:31,125
But, I don't know where he dropped her.

843
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:32,958
Sandy? 
-Sandy of the second floor.

844
00:58:34,166 --> 00:58:36,875
Why is the chick alone? 
Seems no one's fallen for her yet.

845
00:58:40,916 --> 00:58:42,000
Hello? 
-Tell me.

846
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:46,333
Where are you taking me?

847
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:50,500
Hold this.

848
00:58:51,291 --> 00:58:52,708
Looks like dried coriander!

849
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:55,291
Like you don't know! 
-I don't! What is this stuff?

850
00:58:55,416 --> 00:58:56,416
Marijuana!

851
00:58:56,541 --> 00:58:58,166
Marijuana? 
What the hell?

852
00:58:58,291 --> 00:59:00,375
So you're the guy whom Mahalakshmi sent?

853
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:01,958
She smokes marijuana?

854
00:59:02,083 --> 00:59:03,625
I've checked here 
and that floor.

855
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,833
You seem like the nephew 
of the "Anniyan" character!

856
00:59:08,958 --> 00:59:10,583
Do you want Mahalakshmi?

857
00:59:10,708 --> 00:59:12,000
I want her in full! 
And you?

858
00:59:12,125 --> 00:59:14,750
Ask me! Ask! 
Ask me who I am!

859
00:59:14,875 --> 00:59:16,791
I just asked you! 
-Why did you ask me?

860
00:59:16,916 --> 00:59:18,416
Ask this garbage bin!

861
00:59:18,541 --> 00:59:19,916
Ask these leaves!

862
00:59:20,625 --> 00:59:22,083
Ask these bricks!

863
00:59:22,208 --> 00:59:24,458
Ask anyone in this campus!

864
00:59:24,583 --> 00:59:26,583
Why in blazes did you ask me?

865
00:59:26,708 --> 00:59:28,250
You let loose and came before me!

866
00:59:28,375 --> 00:59:30,708
I'm Dhoni, man! 
-What? Dhoni?

867
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:33,083
What's the matter? 
Can't I be Dhoni?

868
00:59:33,208 --> 00:59:34,833
Sure you can! 
-I'm Anthony, man!

869
00:59:34,958 --> 00:59:36,833
Why change your name all of a sudden?

870
00:59:36,958 --> 00:59:40,375
I'll switch names 
but I'll never switch girlfriends!

871
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:43,041
Because, Mahalakshmi is my lover!

872
00:59:44,083 --> 00:59:46,333
No... Mahalakshmi is my life!

873
00:59:46,458 --> 00:59:47,458
Oh dear!

874
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:49,708
I will not give Mahalakshmi up to anyone!

875
00:59:49,833 --> 00:59:52,000
No one can separate me from Mahalakshmi!

876
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,041
Let me go, guys!

877
00:59:58,041 --> 00:59:59,708
I'll tell you about Mahalakshmi.

878
01:00:00,625 --> 01:00:01,625
What is it, dear boy?

879
01:00:05,916 --> 01:00:07,458
They said she drinks hard, huh?

880
01:00:10,375 --> 01:00:11,875
They said she smokes marijuana?

881
01:00:13,208 --> 01:00:15,000
Who said it? 
-Them!

882
01:00:15,125 --> 01:00:16,791
Don't believe any of it!

883
01:00:19,208 --> 01:00:20,250
Crap! All is ruined!

884
01:00:23,416 --> 01:00:24,583
What are you looking for?

885
01:00:25,166 --> 01:00:26,291
My feet?

886
01:00:26,416 --> 01:00:27,791
Want my blessings?

887
01:00:27,916 --> 01:00:29,458
You can have it after it's done.

888
01:00:31,458 --> 01:00:33,166
Do you know something? 
-Ribbon head!

889
01:00:33,291 --> 01:00:35,125
See the model of this block here?

890
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:38,333
We're about to name it after Mahalakshmi!

891
01:00:38,458 --> 01:00:41,541
That one? 
-She has absolutely no vices!

892
01:00:41,666 --> 01:00:43,250
Why the hell is he blabbing about?

893
01:00:43,375 --> 01:00:45,083
But, three months ago...

894
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:46,208
Three months ago?

895
01:00:46,333 --> 01:00:48,166
She, who was the class topper...

896
01:00:49,166 --> 01:00:52,291
...had her heart broken 
by her lover, Joseph.

897
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:54,916
They said his name was Anthony!

898
01:00:55,041 --> 01:00:56,875
Be it Anthony or Joseph!

899
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,916
Even if the names are different, 
the religion is the same, yes?

900
01:01:00,041 --> 01:01:01,125
True... what?

901
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:03,125
A young girl, right?

902
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:05,291
She couldn't bear her broken heart...

903
01:01:05,416 --> 01:01:07,291
...couldn't sleep at night...

904
01:01:07,416 --> 01:01:09,166
...smoked a lot of marijuana...

905
01:01:09,291 --> 01:01:11,416
...boozed heavily...

906
01:01:11,541 --> 01:01:16,416
...spent way too much time in the pub 
and her life transformed for the worse!

907
01:01:16,541 --> 01:01:18,375
She seems to have every vice there is!

908
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:22,833
Far as I know, she doesn't have the habit 
of smoking cigarettes.

909
01:01:25,791 --> 01:01:27,166
She's a lovely girl!

910
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,458
I have it, guys!

911
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:53,791
'O rapturous belle!'

912
01:01:53,916 --> 01:01:56,750
'Are you but simmering honey?'

913
01:01:56,875 --> 01:01:59,208
'My heart leaps for you!'

914
01:02:01,541 --> 01:02:04,833
'Anywhere, anytime...'

915
01:02:04,958 --> 01:02:07,750
'...is music and joy!'

916
01:02:07,875 --> 01:02:10,666
'When comes about the night...'

917
01:02:10,791 --> 01:02:13,250
'...the scriptures take flight!'

918
01:02:14,458 --> 01:02:17,125
'Present is a pretty girl 
and a catchy song.'

919
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:20,416
'Wherever it touches 
knows only joys, no sorrows.'

920
01:02:39,041 --> 01:02:42,000
I only told you to tell him "I love you." 
Why kiss him?

921
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:44,750
With an "I love you", 
he'll be distracted only for a month.

922
01:02:44,875 --> 01:02:47,458
That kiss will distract him 
for the entire semester!

923
01:02:47,583 --> 01:02:48,583
Okay, come!

924
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:13,041
'An eye on an eye is always a plus!'

925
01:03:13,166 --> 01:03:15,625
'No more will there anything minus!'

926
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:20,958
'Only the combination of two minus signs, 
results in an equation!'

927
01:03:21,083 --> 01:03:23,791
'X & Y have been integrated together!'

928
01:03:23,916 --> 01:03:26,375
'And they have been synced together!'

929
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:31,416
'Such linking and syncing 
is what is infatuation!'

930
01:03:42,166 --> 01:03:44,708
'Even if your smile is nano-sized...'

931
01:03:44,833 --> 01:03:47,291
'...my heart will soar 
at the speed of a rocket!'

932
01:03:47,416 --> 01:03:52,666
'Until both our data packs get exhausted, 
let's keep talking!'

933
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:01,041
'An eye on an eye is always a plus!'

934
01:04:01,166 --> 01:04:03,708
'No more will there anything minus!'

935
01:04:03,833 --> 01:04:07,541
What is this? 
-Infatuation! We're both mature, yes?

936
01:04:07,666 --> 01:04:08,666
Keep going!

937
01:04:40,916 --> 01:04:45,875
'Within this diagram of the DNA...'

938
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:51,333
'...only your image, do I see.'

939
01:04:51,458 --> 01:04:56,583
'Neutrons and electrons fill your eyes.'

940
01:04:56,708 --> 01:05:02,000
'Neutralized, is my heart!'

941
01:05:02,125 --> 01:05:07,291
'Centigrade disintegrates 
in the warmth of our kisses!'

942
01:05:07,416 --> 01:05:12,625
'Fahrenheit meets ruin, 
through our fiery love!'

943
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:15,250
'Newton's law, you are!'

944
01:05:15,375 --> 01:05:18,375
I got this, aunty! Go on! 
-'My darling moon, you are!'

945
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:23,250
'If one falls towards the ground, 
it is gravitation!'

946
01:05:24,041 --> 01:05:28,750
'If one falls towards a girl, 
it is infatuation!'

947
01:05:55,541 --> 01:06:00,625
'Unable to understand further!'

948
01:06:00,750 --> 01:06:06,000
'But, the heart does not falter!'

949
01:06:06,125 --> 01:06:11,416
'All of Darwin's theories...'

950
01:06:11,541 --> 01:06:16,750
'...transpire one by one!'

951
01:06:16,875 --> 01:06:21,958
'Do the greetings of hormones, 
arouse feelings within?'

952
01:06:22,083 --> 01:06:27,250
'Does something come to surface, 
beyond that?'

953
01:06:27,375 --> 01:06:30,041
'The first caress, a mystery!'

954
01:06:30,166 --> 01:06:32,791
'The next, a response!'

955
01:06:32,916 --> 01:06:38,583
'Calculation, 
adds numbers together!'

956
01:06:38,708 --> 01:06:43,375
'Infatuation, 
amalgamates hormones together!'

957
01:06:49,208 --> 01:06:51,041
'An eye on an eye is always a plus!'

958
01:06:51,166 --> 01:06:54,500
She's just a kid, grandma! 
-'No more will there anything minus!'

959
01:06:54,625 --> 01:06:59,750
'Only the combination of two minus signs, 
results in an equation!'

960
01:06:59,875 --> 01:07:02,291
'X & Y have been integrated together!'

961
01:07:02,416 --> 01:07:05,000
'And they have been synced together!'

962
01:07:05,125 --> 01:07:10,000
'Such linking and syncing 
is what is infatuation!'

963
01:08:04,666 --> 01:08:06,041
Why? What happened?

964
01:08:06,166 --> 01:08:08,333
Why are you all looking at us like that?

965
01:08:08,458 --> 01:08:10,375
If there's a fuse, swap bulbs. 
Not lips!

966
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:12,375
This is common between guys and girls!

967
01:08:38,250 --> 01:08:39,250
How do you know this?

968
01:08:39,375 --> 01:08:42,333
Not just us! The whole city knows it! 
We've heard it so many times!

969
01:08:43,041 --> 01:08:45,333
Alright then. 
I have no time to discuss this!

970
01:08:45,458 --> 01:08:46,666
We have exams tomorrow!

971
01:08:46,791 --> 01:08:48,583
Come, Maha. Let's study!

972
01:08:50,375 --> 01:08:52,000
The bulb will go out again. 
Use this.

973
01:08:52,125 --> 01:08:53,750
Give me that, you bandicoot!

974
01:08:53,875 --> 01:08:55,041
What is this, man?

975
01:08:55,166 --> 01:08:57,708
This is what they call 'combined studies', 
mom!

976
01:08:59,666 --> 01:09:00,666
What a fine father!

977
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Get going!

978
01:09:12,958 --> 01:09:14,208
Hello, son-in-law!

979
01:09:14,958 --> 01:09:17,291
I've found a great alliance 
for your daughter.

980
01:09:19,583 --> 01:09:21,666
Yes, very much in accordance 
to your status!

981
01:09:23,333 --> 01:09:24,666
Alright. 
Come over.

982
01:09:24,791 --> 01:09:26,125
We'll discuss the rest then.

983
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:06,000
If I'm first in class, 
I'll tell you something.

984
01:10:06,125 --> 01:10:08,333
If I come first, 
I'll tell you something, too!

985
01:10:10,791 --> 01:10:12,833
What did Mahalakshmi want to tell you?

986
01:10:14,583 --> 01:10:16,583
What the hell do women usually say?

987
01:10:16,708 --> 01:10:18,875
"Sorry, 'mama'! Goodbye, 'mama'!" 
What else?

988
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,416
I'll kick the snot out of you!

989
01:10:21,708 --> 01:10:24,333
Who was the topper, bro? 
First, tell us that!

990
01:10:41,708 --> 01:10:45,541
If Balu came first, 
what did you wish to tell him, sis?

991
01:10:46,208 --> 01:10:47,541
Do I look good?

992
01:10:49,708 --> 01:10:51,458
What do you want to tell him?

993
01:10:51,583 --> 01:10:54,250
First, tell me how I look. 
Then, I'll tell you.

994
01:10:54,375 --> 01:10:56,875
You look amazing, sis!

995
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,125
Is that so?

996
01:10:58,250 --> 01:11:00,166
Then, I'll tell you later! 
-Sis!

997
01:11:01,291 --> 01:11:04,583
You never give parties when your son 
tops the class. What has changed?

998
01:11:04,708 --> 01:11:06,958
Please wait a while. 
Groom's on the way.

999
01:11:07,083 --> 01:11:08,750
Soon as he's here, I'll tell you.

1000
01:11:09,958 --> 01:11:12,250
What is this, Mahalakshmi? 
You didn't come first?

1001
01:11:12,375 --> 01:11:14,166
'Mama' certainly did!

1002
01:11:14,291 --> 01:11:17,333
So Balu coming first 
is akin to you coming first? Very well...

1003
01:11:17,458 --> 01:11:19,791
There's some kind of infatuation 
between them!

1004
01:11:19,916 --> 01:11:20,916
Oh? Is that so?

1005
01:11:23,875 --> 01:11:27,041
You came first after you joined forces 
with Maha to torpedo Ajay.

1006
01:11:27,166 --> 01:11:28,958
Awesome, buddy. Congrats!

1007
01:11:31,625 --> 01:11:34,250
What the hell, man? 
Can't you keep your mouth shut?

1008
01:11:34,375 --> 01:11:35,541
Let it slide!

1009
01:11:35,666 --> 01:11:36,666
What did I say wrong?

1010
01:11:40,625 --> 01:11:43,916
Sis, Balu asked that you take a straw 
and come to the terrace!

1011
01:11:46,708 --> 01:11:49,166
A straw, huh? 
Alright, I'll take one!

1012
01:11:50,625 --> 01:11:52,416
Why get upset over this?

1013
01:11:52,541 --> 01:11:55,041
Ups and downs are part of life!

1014
01:11:55,166 --> 01:11:58,208
Don't get too sad 
and think of what to do next.

1015
01:11:59,541 --> 01:12:01,708
Do you get what I'm saying? 
-Who's on the phone?

1016
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:13,916
How about that, 'mama'? 
Gave quite a shock, didn't I?

1017
01:12:14,041 --> 01:12:15,791
Yes, he'd be definitely shocked!

1018
01:12:15,916 --> 01:12:19,500
Said that a treat from me wouldn't be 
possible even if I sold my family fortune?

1019
01:12:19,625 --> 01:12:20,625
See what he does now!

1020
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:22,541
Whatever the case, 
Ajay is great!

1021
01:12:24,583 --> 01:12:28,333
Despite all our planning, 
he only scored 2% less than you!

1022
01:12:29,291 --> 01:12:31,416
Good thing we planned well!

1023
01:12:31,541 --> 01:12:33,625
If not, he may have even topped the class!

1024
01:12:36,208 --> 01:12:39,125
So, you say our plan worked out well?

1025
01:12:40,416 --> 01:12:44,166
So, if your words of love hadn't distracted 
him, he'd have topped the class, yes?

1026
01:12:44,291 --> 01:12:46,958
Definitely, 'mama'! 
He's quite the bookworm!

1027
01:12:47,083 --> 01:12:48,791
He's always reading something!

1028
01:12:51,166 --> 01:12:53,458
However you look at it, 
Ajay's great, right?

1029
01:12:53,583 --> 01:12:56,083
Yes. No doubt about it. 
He's totally great.

1030
01:12:56,208 --> 01:12:57,208
What about me?

1031
01:12:58,416 --> 01:13:01,125
Tell me. 
If Ajay's great, what am I?

1032
01:13:01,250 --> 01:13:02,791
You're great too, 'mama'.

1033
01:13:02,916 --> 01:13:05,125
A question can't have two answers, 
Mahalakshmi.

1034
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:07,333
Is Ajay great or am I great?

1035
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:10,791
You're the great one.

1036
01:13:10,916 --> 01:13:12,000
What was that pause for?

1037
01:13:13,416 --> 01:13:15,666
Only upon thinking, 
does it seem to you I'm great?

1038
01:13:15,791 --> 01:13:17,125
Nothing like that!

1039
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:19,875
Did you say that to compel him? 
-Time to cut the cake, Balu!

1040
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,000
I'll get him, aunty!

1041
01:13:22,458 --> 01:13:25,208
Everyone downstairs is happy. 
Let's go cut the cake!

1042
01:13:25,333 --> 01:13:27,416
Why fight between ourselves now? 
Let's go!

1043
01:13:27,541 --> 01:13:30,083
So you agree with me 
because I'm picking a fight, yes?

1044
01:13:30,208 --> 01:13:31,625
So, Ajay is great, huh?

1045
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:35,375
So this is what you wanted to tell me 
if I came first?

1046
01:13:36,166 --> 01:13:37,166
No, 'mama'!

1047
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:41,791
Hold on!

1048
01:13:41,916 --> 01:13:42,916
Please don't talk to me!

1049
01:13:44,083 --> 01:13:45,583
I have no joy in being topper!

1050
01:13:46,625 --> 01:13:48,833
It's as if someone threw alms to me!

1051
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:52,000
Where were you all this time? 
Cut the cake and get this party going!

1052
01:13:52,125 --> 01:13:54,166
No party or anything! 
Ask everyone to leave!

1053
01:13:56,750 --> 01:13:58,375
What do I look like to you?

1054
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:00,791
You call Ajay great! 
How can he ever be great?

1055
01:14:02,333 --> 01:14:03,875
How could you think such a thing?

1056
01:14:06,833 --> 01:14:07,916
Listen up!

1057
01:14:08,041 --> 01:14:10,458
How can a guy who gets disturbed, 
ever be great?

1058
01:14:10,583 --> 01:14:14,000
If one loves studying, 
nothing would ever distract them!

1059
01:14:14,125 --> 01:14:16,500
Didn't you disturb me 
in the name of infatuation?

1060
01:14:16,625 --> 01:14:17,875
Was I distracted?

1061
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,250
Did I distract you, 'mama'?

1062
01:14:19,375 --> 01:14:21,583
Yes! Didn't you distract me 
like you did with Ajay?

1063
01:14:21,708 --> 01:14:23,041
And, both are the same, is it?

1064
01:14:23,166 --> 01:14:24,583
Yes, it is!

1065
01:14:24,708 --> 01:14:26,916
If they're the same, 
I'll tell you right now!

1066
01:14:27,041 --> 01:14:28,458
Ajay is greater than you!

1067
01:14:31,583 --> 01:14:32,708
Get out of here!

1068
01:14:32,833 --> 01:14:35,000
You eat in our house, 
but praise him?

1069
01:14:35,125 --> 01:14:37,000
What? 
What did you just say?

1070
01:14:37,125 --> 01:14:39,500
I said that you eat in our house 
but praise him!

1071
01:14:39,625 --> 01:14:41,791
What are you saying, Balu? 
What happened to you?

1072
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:43,625
Look at her, dad!

1073
01:14:44,375 --> 01:14:48,250
After getting her out of some village, 
letting her stay here, feeding her...

1074
01:14:48,375 --> 01:14:51,291
...and helping her study, 
she calls someone else great!

1075
01:14:51,416 --> 01:14:52,541
Ajay's great, huh?

1076
01:14:52,666 --> 01:14:53,875
Who fed whom?

1077
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,208
If it wasn't for my dad's help, 
uncle couldn't have set up his business!

1078
01:14:57,333 --> 01:14:58,875
Understand that!

1079
01:15:00,208 --> 01:15:02,333
He's just ranting about. 
Don't join him!

1080
01:15:03,625 --> 01:15:05,375
What is all of this, man?

1081
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:08,208
In such a joyous time, 
why fight like so?

1082
01:15:08,333 --> 01:15:09,333
Be quiet, dear boy!

1083
01:15:10,125 --> 01:15:11,625
Hear what she's saying, mom?

1084
01:15:12,416 --> 01:15:13,750
They gave us all of this, huh?

1085
01:15:13,875 --> 01:15:16,041
All we have is alms they gave us, 
she says!

1086
01:15:16,166 --> 01:15:18,708
If my dad hadn't pitied you 
and gotten you out of that dump...

1087
01:15:18,833 --> 01:15:20,416
...you'd still be patting dung there!

1088
01:15:20,541 --> 01:15:22,958
Least I would've just been patting dung!

1089
01:15:23,083 --> 01:15:25,666
You would've ripped your clothes, 
stared at the sky...

1090
01:15:25,791 --> 01:15:28,625
...and streaked across the streets 
screaming 'first rank'!

1091
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:30,708
Yes! I can't survive 
without being topper!

1092
01:15:30,833 --> 01:15:32,041
But, remember this!

1093
01:15:32,166 --> 01:15:34,041
If not for us, 
your family can't survive!

1094
01:15:34,166 --> 01:15:35,375
What the hell, man? 
-True!

1095
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:38,083
You gave me a place to stay, study 
and eat!

1096
01:15:38,208 --> 01:15:40,500
If not for your family, 
we couldn't have survived!

1097
01:15:40,625 --> 01:15:41,958
Thank you very much for that!

1098
01:15:42,625 --> 01:15:43,750
But, here's the thing!

1099
01:15:43,875 --> 01:15:46,666
I'll find a job 
and settle our debt!

1100
01:15:46,791 --> 01:15:48,791
With interest, too! 
Will that suffice?

1101
01:15:48,916 --> 01:15:50,583
Who the hell will give you a job?

1102
01:15:50,708 --> 01:15:52,916
Maybe once I start a company, 
ask me for a job!

1103
01:15:53,041 --> 01:15:54,833
I'll be kind enough to oblige. 
-Stop it!

1104
01:15:54,958 --> 01:15:56,250
Work with it. 
Now go!

1105
01:15:56,375 --> 01:15:57,791
That's alright!

1106
01:15:57,916 --> 01:16:00,416
Let me know if you have problems 
running your company!

1107
01:16:00,541 --> 01:16:02,208
I'll come and help!

1108
01:16:03,458 --> 01:16:05,750
I'll make you say 
"That is Mahalakshmi"!

1109
01:16:05,875 --> 01:16:07,041
Get lost!

1110
01:16:07,166 --> 01:16:08,208
Dad!

1111
01:16:08,333 --> 01:16:10,250
Talk to him, mom! 
-What is this, man?

1112
01:16:10,375 --> 01:16:12,458
Don't cry, dear. 
Don't cry.

1113
01:16:12,583 --> 01:16:14,333
I'm here for you. 
-No need, dad!

1114
01:16:14,458 --> 01:16:16,875
Welcome, son-in-law. 
Just arrived?

1115
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,916
Why stand here? Come in. 
-No, dad! Let's leave.

1116
01:16:21,041 --> 01:16:22,041
Brother-in-law!

1117
01:16:23,208 --> 01:16:24,708
Get me out of here, dad! 
-Come in!

1118
01:16:24,833 --> 01:16:27,666
Small tussle between kids. We'll talk! 
-No, Subbu.

1119
01:16:27,791 --> 01:16:29,083
We'll talk later.

1120
01:16:30,375 --> 01:16:31,458
Come, dear.

1121
01:16:31,583 --> 01:16:32,583
Hold on!

1122
01:16:33,416 --> 01:16:35,208
Tell me the computer password and go!

1123
01:16:50,541 --> 01:16:51,666
"Balu Mama."

1124
01:17:03,208 --> 01:17:04,916
All aunties, please leave!

1125
01:17:05,041 --> 01:17:06,458
We need to speak to her alone!

1126
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,791
Hello sis!

1127
01:17:13,708 --> 01:17:14,875
How are you all studying?

1128
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,958
Why do you ask Balu-type questions?

1129
01:17:17,083 --> 01:17:18,708
Close your eyes, sis!

1130
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:20,500
Why?

1131
01:17:26,375 --> 01:17:27,833
I've stopped eating chicken.

1132
01:17:27,958 --> 01:17:31,500
What? 
You've stopped eating chicken?

1133
01:17:31,625 --> 01:17:32,625
Yes, I have.

1134
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:33,750
What happened, sis?

1135
01:17:34,625 --> 01:17:36,875
Did Balu say anything to you? 
Tell me, sis!

1136
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,791
Nowadays, I work out at the gym. 
I'll rip him to shreds!

1137
01:17:40,875 --> 01:17:43,000
What happened, sis? 
Tell us!

1138
01:17:43,125 --> 01:17:45,583
You all know that Balu and I 
got into a fight, right?

1139
01:17:46,666 --> 01:17:48,291
After that, we stopped talking.

1140
01:17:49,416 --> 01:17:51,666
A few days later, I got a phone call.

1141
01:17:52,666 --> 01:17:54,958
I learnt that grandma 
was in a critical condition.

1142
01:18:11,916 --> 01:18:13,375
How is she, doctor?

1143
01:18:15,125 --> 01:18:17,541
Who are you? 
-She is my grandmother, too.

1144
01:18:17,666 --> 01:18:18,666
Ask him.

1145
01:18:21,416 --> 01:18:22,416
Uncle...

1146
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:25,250
How is grandma, uncle?

1147
01:18:26,041 --> 01:18:27,416
Oh wow!

1148
01:18:27,541 --> 01:18:29,041
Is this the same Mahalakshmi?

1149
01:18:29,166 --> 01:18:32,541
What's up? When did you get here? 
How are you?

1150
01:18:32,666 --> 01:18:34,875
Tell me how grandma's doing, uncle.

1151
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,458
Oh, throw that old crow in the trash!

1152
01:18:37,583 --> 01:18:39,625
You said you'd pay us back with interest!

1153
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:42,458
Do you have it with you now? 
How come you have no suitcase?

1154
01:18:44,708 --> 01:18:46,125
Intend to pay us by cheque?

1155
01:18:46,250 --> 01:18:47,916
Please, uncle. 
How is she?

1156
01:18:48,041 --> 01:18:49,083
What do I say, dear?

1157
01:18:50,125 --> 01:18:53,375
I brought you here to study, 
so you wouldn't struggle in your village.

1158
01:18:54,250 --> 01:18:57,250
But, you said you'll pay everything back 
with interest and left.

1159
01:18:57,375 --> 01:18:58,750
Do you know something, Maha?

1160
01:18:58,875 --> 01:19:00,708
You were only a baby when your mom died.

1161
01:19:01,458 --> 01:19:03,750
Your aunt was the one who nursed 
and raised you.

1162
01:19:03,875 --> 01:19:05,750
Are you looking to settle that debt, too?

1163
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,166
Tell me, Mahalakshmi.

1164
01:19:10,541 --> 01:19:12,041
Please forgive me, uncle!

1165
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,083
Your grandma is fine. 
Nothing's wrong with her.

1166
01:19:22,583 --> 01:19:25,291
With your tears, 
you've paid up the interest. Okay?

1167
01:19:27,166 --> 01:19:28,166
Now smile!

1168
01:19:30,208 --> 01:19:31,833
Now you've paid the principal, too!

1169
01:19:31,958 --> 01:19:33,666
Come, let's go see grandma.

1170
01:19:34,666 --> 01:19:36,041
Have change for 2,000 rupees?

1171
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:41,083
Have change for 2,000 rupees, sir?

1172
01:19:46,041 --> 01:19:47,583
Have change for 2,000 bucks, bro?

1173
01:19:47,708 --> 01:19:48,708
Nephew?

1174
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:51,375
When did you come, uncle? 
Didn't see you.

1175
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:52,750
Sure, I believe you.

1176
01:19:52,875 --> 01:19:55,208
How much change do you want? 
-A hundred rupees.

1177
01:19:57,666 --> 01:19:59,291
Here. First go and pay it up.

1178
01:19:59,416 --> 01:20:00,416
Here you go, uncle.

1179
01:20:01,458 --> 01:20:02,666
It's alright, dear boy.

1180
01:20:02,791 --> 01:20:05,416
We'll adjust it when we settle our account.

1181
01:20:05,541 --> 01:20:06,916
Go on. 
-I'm sorry, uncle.

1182
01:20:10,750 --> 01:20:13,458
Don't know how, but she just fainted 
after the cake cutting.

1183
01:20:13,583 --> 01:20:15,500
I've gotten the report. 
-After that, I...

1184
01:20:15,625 --> 01:20:17,875
What is it, son? Paid the fee? 
-Yes.

1185
01:20:40,791 --> 01:20:43,125
Want to me to buy a coffee or something 
for you?

1186
01:20:43,250 --> 01:20:44,708
We've already had some.

1187
01:20:44,833 --> 01:20:47,083
You and Mahalakshmi go have some. 
Alright?

1188
01:20:48,708 --> 01:20:49,708
And then...

1189
01:21:06,708 --> 01:21:08,291
Heads. 
So you must talk first.

1190
01:21:08,416 --> 01:21:10,666
But, you already spoke first.

1191
01:21:10,791 --> 01:21:12,416
You never gave me that chance.

1192
01:21:13,958 --> 01:21:14,958
How are you?

1193
01:21:15,875 --> 01:21:17,125
So far, not so good.

1194
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:19,000
Recession period, right?

1195
01:21:19,125 --> 01:21:20,791
I lost my job because of it.

1196
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:23,333
Confident about the job, 
I bought a flat.

1197
01:21:23,458 --> 01:21:25,583
As I lost my job, 
couldn't pay the EMI.

1198
01:21:25,708 --> 01:21:28,250
After that, we had to sell the land 
we had in the village.

1199
01:21:28,375 --> 01:21:29,916
Right now, even dad stays with me.

1200
01:21:31,375 --> 01:21:33,375
Overall, the situation is pretty bad.

1201
01:21:36,083 --> 01:21:37,666
Why are you looking at me like that?

1202
01:21:37,791 --> 01:21:40,166
Only if I say such things, 
you will be glad, right?

1203
01:21:42,416 --> 01:21:44,375
Now you make me happy.

1204
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:47,000
Last year, I started a company. 
Didn't go well at all!

1205
01:21:47,125 --> 01:21:48,208
100 crore rupees lost!

1206
01:21:48,333 --> 01:21:51,958
Never mind saving money, 
I have none to even shave my beard!

1207
01:21:52,083 --> 01:21:53,875
This is the last shirt I have.

1208
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,791
After this, I need to borrow from Kumar!

1209
01:21:55,916 --> 01:21:57,583
Grandma's unwell... 
-That's enough.

1210
01:21:57,708 --> 01:21:59,083
I became very happy.

1211
01:22:04,750 --> 01:22:06,333
How childish we were!

1212
01:22:07,041 --> 01:22:08,291
When I slept, you studied!

1213
01:22:08,416 --> 01:22:10,708
Know how I jealous I was 
when you topped the class?

1214
01:22:10,833 --> 01:22:12,250
I'd tear your books apart!

1215
01:22:12,375 --> 01:22:14,833
You'd study your books 
by hiding them in film magazines!

1216
01:22:14,958 --> 01:22:18,416
I challenged you that you'd be forced 
to say "That is Mahalakshmi!"

1217
01:22:18,541 --> 01:22:21,000
I said that I'd get you a job 
in my company!

1218
01:22:21,125 --> 01:22:23,666
Thinking about all of these 
used to make me laugh hard!

1219
01:22:24,666 --> 01:22:27,666
Okay, Mahalakshmi. Now tell me the truth. 
What are you doing now?

1220
01:22:28,750 --> 01:22:30,458
I'm working at Infosys.

1221
01:22:30,583 --> 01:22:34,041
With a salary of 1.5 lakh rupees. 
I've bought at flat at East Coast Road.

1222
01:22:35,416 --> 01:22:36,708
What have you been up to?

1223
01:22:38,375 --> 01:22:42,375
To tell you the truth, you know that 
I can't live without being number one.

1224
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:45,708
Last year, I started a company. 
'Cloud Technologies'.

1225
01:22:45,833 --> 01:22:47,708
We have a little over hundred employees.

1226
01:22:47,833 --> 01:22:49,458
Annual turnover is 40 crore rupees.

1227
01:22:49,583 --> 01:22:51,375
I'm about to open another branch, too.

1228
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:53,166
How much did you say your salary was?

1229
01:22:56,208 --> 01:22:58,708
The lowest pay I give my employees 
is two lakh rupees.

1230
01:23:01,583 --> 01:23:03,208
If you ever want a job, call me.

1231
01:23:03,333 --> 01:23:05,750
I'll set you up with a great job. 
Don't worry.

1232
01:23:05,875 --> 01:23:08,250
So I must plead with you 
if I want a job, right?

1233
01:23:08,375 --> 01:23:09,625
Only then will you give me.

1234
01:23:09,750 --> 01:23:11,750
I didn't mean it like that!

1235
01:23:11,875 --> 01:23:14,250
Why are you talking like this? 
I'm not the man I was.

1236
01:23:14,375 --> 01:23:16,666
I've changed a lot! 
How do I prove it to you?

1237
01:23:19,625 --> 01:23:21,416
Ajay is great! 
Is that alright?

1238
01:23:21,541 --> 01:23:23,041
I agree that Ajay is great.

1239
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:29,791
What is this? I admit that Ajay is great 
and you still won't say that I'm great!

1240
01:23:31,208 --> 01:23:33,958
When you first started talking, 
I thought you had matured a bit.

1241
01:23:34,083 --> 01:23:35,416
But, not even a little bit...

1242
01:23:36,416 --> 01:23:39,083
I knew that you weren't mature enough 
to talk to me!

1243
01:23:39,208 --> 01:23:41,083
That's why I broke the ice!

1244
01:23:43,166 --> 01:23:44,416
You haven't changed at all!

1245
01:23:44,541 --> 01:23:46,541
You haven't changed either, Mahalakshmi.

1246
01:23:48,541 --> 01:23:50,375
Get the luggage from the car! 
-Yes, sir!

1247
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:51,500
Welcome, uncle!

1248
01:23:53,833 --> 01:23:54,916
Are you well?

1249
01:23:59,791 --> 01:24:00,791
I am well.

1250
01:24:02,083 --> 01:24:03,166
Who the hell is this guy?

1251
01:24:03,291 --> 01:24:05,583
How can he take the luggage 
without my permission?

1252
01:24:05,708 --> 01:24:07,166
His name is Appu, uncle.

1253
01:24:07,291 --> 01:24:10,458
Since his youth, he has stayed with us 
as domestic help.

1254
01:24:10,583 --> 01:24:13,208
I'm a member of this family, too! 
-Family member, eh?

1255
01:24:13,333 --> 01:24:15,958
Don't say that! 
If you're a family member, then what am I?

1256
01:24:16,083 --> 01:24:17,666
Just say 'family employee'!

1257
01:24:17,791 --> 01:24:19,500
Uncle! 
You...

1258
01:24:19,625 --> 01:24:21,250
Your Benz car was black, right?

1259
01:24:21,375 --> 01:24:23,458
You've come in a white one. 
-It is a black Benz!

1260
01:24:23,583 --> 01:24:25,291
The Indian climate mustn't ruin it.

1261
01:24:25,416 --> 01:24:26,583
So, I painted it white!

1262
01:24:26,708 --> 01:24:28,625
Could've just bought a white one instead!

1263
01:24:28,750 --> 01:24:30,958
A black car can be painted white!

1264
01:24:31,083 --> 01:24:32,750
How do you paint a white car white?

1265
01:24:32,875 --> 01:24:34,708
No... 
-My sister didn't raise you well!

1266
01:24:34,833 --> 01:24:37,291
Thought you forgetfully took 
another person's car!

1267
01:24:38,291 --> 01:24:39,375
Me? Forgetful?

1268
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:41,250
You're talking like a child, Kumar!

1269
01:24:41,375 --> 01:24:43,500
Good grief! 
My name isn't Kumar, uncle!

1270
01:24:43,625 --> 01:24:45,458
It's Subbu! 
-Don't I know that?

1271
01:24:45,583 --> 01:24:48,875
When you were a kid, 
I used to lovingly call you 'Kumar baby'!

1272
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,125
Ask your mom about it!

1273
01:24:50,250 --> 01:24:52,125
Listen up! 
I'm Robert Ramaiah!

1274
01:24:52,250 --> 01:24:54,750
2 GB RAM! 
20 GB memory!

1275
01:24:54,875 --> 01:24:57,500
Even if Google forgets, 
Robert Ramaiah will not!

1276
01:24:57,625 --> 01:24:59,916
My strength is my memory! 
Let's go!

1277
01:25:02,208 --> 01:25:03,875
Is that so, uncle?

1278
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,291
Brother-in-law! 
My uncle from America!

1279
01:25:06,416 --> 01:25:07,416
He is Jayanthi's...

1280
01:25:07,541 --> 01:25:09,083
I know! 
Jayanthi's husband, yes?

1281
01:25:09,208 --> 01:25:10,708
I handed him the nuptial thread!

1282
01:25:10,833 --> 01:25:12,375
You didn't come to their wedding!

1283
01:25:13,541 --> 01:25:16,583
Also, after your child was born, 
I wanted to call you.

1284
01:25:16,708 --> 01:25:19,541
As I didn't have your number, 
I couldn't. Please give it to me.

1285
01:25:23,333 --> 01:25:26,208
Oh man! 
Storing Indian phone numbers are a pain!

1286
01:25:26,333 --> 01:25:28,125
If you don't mind, 
please save it for me.

1287
01:25:29,583 --> 01:25:31,250
Dear nephew! 
-What is it, uncle?

1288
01:25:32,458 --> 01:25:33,833
Maybe he can't see.

1289
01:25:34,625 --> 01:25:37,458
My eyes are fine. 
Please save your phone number.

1290
01:25:37,583 --> 01:25:39,041
Nephew... 
-Yes, uncle?

1291
01:25:40,166 --> 01:25:41,500
Maybe he's illiterate.

1292
01:25:41,625 --> 01:25:44,458
I know how to read and write! 
Please store it for me!

1293
01:25:44,583 --> 01:25:46,250
Nephew? 
-Yes, uncle?

1294
01:25:47,541 --> 01:25:50,000
When did you renovate the house? 
-Six months ago.

1295
01:25:51,125 --> 01:25:52,166
What's wrong?

1296
01:25:52,291 --> 01:25:54,333
For six months, 
it looks very old!

1297
01:25:54,458 --> 01:25:57,875
In America, we shift houses every month!

1298
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,750
Have you saved it? 
Give me that.

1299
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:03,791
'Krishna'. 
Still those archaic names!

1300
01:26:03,916 --> 01:26:06,250
Much like your look, 
you haven't changed your name!

1301
01:26:07,333 --> 01:26:09,833
Got a taste of my uncle's memory power?

1302
01:26:12,666 --> 01:26:14,250
Even if Google forgets, 
I will not!

1303
01:26:14,375 --> 01:26:16,458
If you have so much memory, 
you'd remember me!

1304
01:26:16,583 --> 01:26:18,500
Of course, I'd remember! 
You are...

1305
01:26:20,750 --> 01:26:21,791
Tell me! 
-You are...

1306
01:26:21,916 --> 01:26:23,250
Krishna's son, right?

1307
01:26:23,375 --> 01:26:25,333
No, uncle! 
He's my son!

1308
01:26:25,458 --> 01:26:27,541
If he's your son, 
he's Krishna's son-in-law!

1309
01:26:27,666 --> 01:26:29,583
No one understands that!

1310
01:26:29,708 --> 01:26:31,291
Think hard, kiddo!

1311
01:26:31,416 --> 01:26:33,833
In your childhood, 
you'd keep playing with my beard!

1312
01:26:33,958 --> 01:26:36,583
While going to school, 
you'd hold my finger and tag along!

1313
01:26:36,708 --> 01:26:39,166
When you were just an infant, 
he went to America!

1314
01:26:39,291 --> 01:26:40,375
Only now, did he return!

1315
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:43,333
I wanted to connect with you on WhatsApp 
and chat with you.

1316
01:26:43,458 --> 01:26:46,416
As I didn't have your number, I couldn't. 
Save it on my phone.

1317
01:26:46,541 --> 01:26:48,666
My number, right? 
Sure, I'll save it for you.

1318
01:26:48,791 --> 01:26:50,500
Oh, man! 
Please hurry.

1319
01:26:51,416 --> 01:26:52,791
Change your expression, man!

1320
01:26:52,916 --> 01:26:53,916
Faster, kiddo!

1321
01:26:54,041 --> 01:26:56,583
Like a cricket umpire, 
he keeps staring at me!

1322
01:26:56,708 --> 01:27:00,333
You save the numbers correctly, 
but just forget to call!

1323
01:27:00,458 --> 01:27:03,416
I didn't forget, Surya! 
I was just busy!

1324
01:27:03,541 --> 01:27:04,750
Who is Surya, uncle?

1325
01:27:04,875 --> 01:27:06,041
Oh! Busted, am I?

1326
01:27:06,750 --> 01:27:08,208
Actor Surya from 'Singam' films!

1327
01:27:08,333 --> 01:27:10,125
Forgotten your son's name, have you?

1328
01:27:10,250 --> 01:27:11,666
My name isn't Surya. It's Balu.

1329
01:27:11,791 --> 01:27:15,125
To test your 2 GB RAM and 20 GB memory, 
I saved my number in another name.

1330
01:27:15,791 --> 01:27:18,833
I flew down here after learning that 
my sister was unwell!

1331
01:27:18,958 --> 01:27:21,708
Why do the silly kids mess with me like so?

1332
01:27:21,833 --> 01:27:24,458
Look that way! 
His glances freak the hell out of me!

1333
01:27:26,750 --> 01:27:29,083
Heard you have a heart problem, sis! 
What happened?

1334
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,166
Why you little...

1335
01:27:31,291 --> 01:27:34,666
Only if I'm ill and bed-ridden 
will you remember me?

1336
01:27:34,791 --> 01:27:36,625
Don't talk to me about memory, sis!

1337
01:27:36,750 --> 01:27:38,166
I have all numbers stored here!

1338
01:27:38,291 --> 01:27:40,458
But, I have your number in here! 
No, in here!

1339
01:27:40,583 --> 01:27:44,083
I owe my name, frame and life 
to my parents.

1340
01:27:44,208 --> 01:27:47,250
But, the one who sent me abroad, 
made me study, bought me a car...

1341
01:27:47,375 --> 01:27:50,791
...and brought me social status was you! 
Will I ever forget that?

1342
01:27:52,125 --> 01:27:54,416
Bhavani? 
-I'm not Bhavani. My name is Aruna.

1343
01:27:54,541 --> 01:27:57,208
Okay, Aruna. 
Could you get some coffee with sugar?

1344
01:27:57,333 --> 01:27:58,958
Please and thanks. 
-Be right back!

1345
01:28:01,750 --> 01:28:05,250
In our family, 
everyone's heart is strong, sis!

1346
01:28:05,375 --> 01:28:07,833
But, I can't believe that you have 
heart problems!

1347
01:28:07,958 --> 01:28:12,583
Whatever you can't share on social media, 
you can share with me.

1348
01:28:12,708 --> 01:28:14,791
I must look into it, rectify it 
and cure you!

1349
01:28:14,916 --> 01:28:18,291
I must return my gratitude! 
Hence why I returned from America. Tell me!

1350
01:28:20,208 --> 01:28:22,791
What has affected my sister 
is no ordinary heart attack.

1351
01:28:22,916 --> 01:28:25,166
Even doctors in America or London 
cannot cure it!

1352
01:28:25,750 --> 01:28:26,875
Uncle!

1353
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,750
We normally can't understand you.

1354
01:28:28,875 --> 01:28:30,916
Now, you're speaking incoherently!

1355
01:28:31,041 --> 01:28:33,708
Please tell us very clearly 
what you want to say.

1356
01:28:33,833 --> 01:28:34,875
What do I say?

1357
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,416
My sister's wishing for a marriage! 
-What?

1358
01:28:37,541 --> 01:28:38,708
It's not what you think!

1359
01:28:38,833 --> 01:28:42,666
My sister's last wish is to see 
Balu and Maha get married.

1360
01:28:42,791 --> 01:28:43,791
What do you say?

1361
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,500
What do we have to say about this?

1362
01:28:50,625 --> 01:28:52,958
If the kids are okay with it, 
so are we!

1363
01:29:01,708 --> 01:29:03,166
If Balu's okay with it...

1364
01:29:03,291 --> 01:29:05,333
Sorry, uncle. 
I already have a girlfriend.

1365
01:29:06,083 --> 01:29:07,166
I'm going to marry her.

1366
01:29:08,833 --> 01:29:11,666
What he said might give me a heart attack! 
-What are you saying?

1367
01:29:11,791 --> 01:29:13,791
Who knows how my sister 
would react to this?

1368
01:29:17,916 --> 01:29:19,166
Mom, this is Swapna.

1369
01:29:21,375 --> 01:29:23,041
Yeah, go with that!

1370
01:29:24,833 --> 01:29:26,791
How come you never told me about this?

1371
01:29:31,333 --> 01:29:32,875
I already told you her name!

1372
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,833
Then, I don't need your number.

1373
01:29:34,958 --> 01:29:35,958
Who is she, Balu?

1374
01:29:37,041 --> 01:29:39,958
I told you I wouldn't introduce 
one person in this house, right?

1375
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:42,791
She is that person.

1376
01:29:49,375 --> 01:29:51,041
Tsk-ing like a horse is all you can do.

1377
01:29:51,166 --> 01:29:53,083
He's got a chick that's as pretty 
as a pony!

1378
01:30:00,250 --> 01:30:02,166
Balu's got excellent taste, yes?

1379
01:30:02,291 --> 01:30:05,666
Balu's got excellent taste. 
But, she has horrible taste!

1380
01:30:07,541 --> 01:30:10,583
Balu's quite the short tempered guy. 
How'd you hook up with him?

1381
01:30:10,708 --> 01:30:12,750
Oh no, uncle! 
He's nothing like that!

1382
01:30:12,875 --> 01:30:15,541
As far as I'm concerned, 
Balu is great!

1383
01:30:17,458 --> 01:30:19,083
That word would've mesmerized him!

1384
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,500
Now watch how I extract the truth from her.

1385
01:30:22,625 --> 01:30:25,333
Alright, Apna... 
I mean, Swapna...

1386
01:30:26,333 --> 01:30:28,583
I'll ask you some questions 
on your personality.

1387
01:30:28,708 --> 01:30:30,875
You must answer them bravely. 
Okay?

1388
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,750
Your height... 
-5 foot 7 inches.

1389
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:35,500
And that means?

1390
01:30:35,625 --> 01:30:37,166
She's two inches taller than me.

1391
01:30:39,708 --> 01:30:41,541
And your salary? 
-Two lakh rupees!

1392
01:30:43,416 --> 01:30:44,791
How much for you?

1393
01:30:44,916 --> 01:30:46,500
50,000 rupees more than me.

1394
01:30:49,541 --> 01:30:51,041
With regards to personality...

1395
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,250
Saw how I nailed him?

1396
01:30:57,083 --> 01:30:59,000
Failed in one subject! 
Just passed in two!

1397
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,416
A real dunce!

1398
01:31:02,458 --> 01:31:05,083
Who is a dunce? 
Her or you?

1399
01:31:05,208 --> 01:31:07,083
You've just embarrassed America!

1400
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:11,833
Phone number, huh? 
Still four digits short!

1401
01:31:11,958 --> 01:31:15,208
It's not a phone number, 
but the measurements of Miss India.

1402
01:31:18,833 --> 01:31:20,041
Measurements, huh?

1403
01:31:21,041 --> 01:31:23,416
He would've exaggerated, anyway. 
How about yours?

1404
01:31:33,208 --> 01:31:34,208
Dad!

1405
01:31:34,833 --> 01:31:36,083
Quickly find a groom for me.

1406
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:40,083
Smarter, cuter and more stylish 
than Balu!

1407
01:31:41,083 --> 01:31:43,166
Overall, he must be more than the best 
of Balu!

1408
01:31:43,291 --> 01:31:44,458
What are you trying to say?

1409
01:31:44,583 --> 01:31:47,958
That Balu is stylish, cute 
and intelligent...

1410
01:31:48,083 --> 01:31:51,041
...and overall, Balu is the best. 
Am I right?

1411
01:31:53,708 --> 01:31:54,708
What a lovely girl.

1412
01:32:13,083 --> 01:32:16,083
It appears one can live here 
without a ration card or Aadhar card.

1413
01:32:16,208 --> 01:32:17,750
But, not without a boyfriend, eh?

1414
01:32:17,875 --> 01:32:20,625
Uncle, if Balu can have a partner 
can I not have one, too?

1415
01:32:23,208 --> 01:32:25,500
Why must we wait so long 
for a 'pannadhi' (beggar)?

1416
01:32:25,625 --> 01:32:26,750
"Pannadhi"?

1417
01:32:26,875 --> 01:32:28,125
Is that his name?

1418
01:32:28,250 --> 01:32:30,541
Lovely name. "Pannadhi". 
Is he a Korean?

1419
01:32:33,125 --> 01:32:36,333
I don't believe that anyone could 
ever fall in love with Mahalakshmi!

1420
01:32:36,458 --> 01:32:37,541
Hey, Ajay!

1421
01:32:51,250 --> 01:32:53,041
What problem would the car have, dear?

1422
01:32:53,166 --> 01:32:54,250
A Benz car, no less!

1423
01:32:54,375 --> 01:32:57,208
No, uncle. 
Just that Ajay's height is 6'1''.

1424
01:32:57,333 --> 01:32:58,791
His head bumps on to the roof!

1425
01:32:58,916 --> 01:33:01,125
6'1''? 
Are the military looking to enlist him?

1426
01:33:01,250 --> 01:33:03,708
It means he's two inches taller than you, 
Balu!

1427
01:33:03,833 --> 01:33:06,166
Does your head not bump 
onto your car, dear boy?

1428
01:33:06,291 --> 01:33:08,041
What are you asking, uncle?

1429
01:33:08,166 --> 01:33:13,625
For this very problem, he's bought 
three specially designed Audi cars!

1430
01:33:13,750 --> 01:33:14,875
Three cars, huh?

1431
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,416
That means he has two cars more than you!

1432
01:33:17,541 --> 01:33:20,000
Do you have a call taxi company, 
Ajay?

1433
01:33:20,125 --> 01:33:23,291
What's that, uncle? 
A call taxi company?

1434
01:33:23,416 --> 01:33:25,291
He owns an IT company!

1435
01:33:25,416 --> 01:33:27,375
With an annual turnover of 100 crores!

1436
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:28,500
100 crores, huh?

1437
01:33:29,583 --> 01:33:31,666
That's double that of Balu!

1438
01:33:33,041 --> 01:33:34,041
So Balu?

1439
01:33:35,250 --> 01:33:37,541
Why talk about all this now, 
Mahalakshmi?

1440
01:33:37,666 --> 01:33:39,125
You know I don't like this, yes?

1441
01:33:40,208 --> 01:33:41,541
See that, uncle?

1442
01:33:41,666 --> 01:33:44,125
He doesn't like it 
when anyone praises him!

1443
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,500
Because of that, in my opinion, 
Ajay is great. Always.

1444
01:33:56,166 --> 01:33:57,291
Are you blind?

1445
01:33:57,416 --> 01:33:59,250
There was no collision! 
Why hit me?

1446
01:33:59,375 --> 01:34:01,916
Thankfully, the car is okay. 
-Drive carefully!

1447
01:34:02,041 --> 01:34:04,333
How do you know that the car is okay?

1448
01:34:04,458 --> 01:34:06,625
Maha, this isn't a car. 
It's my life.

1449
01:34:06,750 --> 01:34:08,958
My heart will stop 
if anything happens to it!

1450
01:34:10,833 --> 01:34:11,833
Tell me, Balu.

1451
01:34:11,958 --> 01:34:14,083
Approve that SIM card company project!

1452
01:34:14,208 --> 01:34:16,333
This year, 
our turnover must cross 100 crores!

1453
01:34:16,458 --> 01:34:18,208
That's really hard, buddy.

1454
01:34:18,333 --> 01:34:20,625
For we need to buy new systems 
and hire more staff.

1455
01:34:20,750 --> 01:34:23,583
It's a really big process. 
The smallest slip can lead to loss!

1456
01:34:23,708 --> 01:34:25,083
What if it succeeds?

1457
01:34:25,208 --> 01:34:26,833
That's not it, buddy. Very risky.

1458
01:34:26,958 --> 01:34:29,958
Why? Despite you knowing nothing, 
I've kept you on as a partner.

1459
01:34:30,083 --> 01:34:31,625
Is this a bigger risk than that?

1460
01:34:31,750 --> 01:34:33,208
Are those two the same, buddy?

1461
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Very well then.

1462
01:34:35,125 --> 01:34:36,416
Do what I say, man!

1463
01:34:36,541 --> 01:34:37,958
Awesome twist, sis!

1464
01:34:38,083 --> 01:34:39,875
You nailed Ajay's entrance!

1465
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,791
Balu must have been shocked!

1466
01:34:41,916 --> 01:34:44,291
During that time, 
you must have called us!

1467
01:34:44,416 --> 01:34:46,583
We'd have ridiculed Balu 
to make him mad further!

1468
01:34:46,708 --> 01:34:48,458
Yes, sis!

1469
01:34:48,583 --> 01:34:51,250
Then, how did the engagement happen?

1470
01:34:59,375 --> 01:35:04,666
'Like a piece of paper 
that flutters in the air...'

1471
01:35:04,791 --> 01:35:10,041
'...why did you move away from me, 
O dear girl?'

1472
01:35:10,166 --> 01:35:15,416
'Mistaking a mirage 
to be an image of true love...'

1473
01:35:15,541 --> 01:35:20,708
'...I sought it out, 
but it was for all naught!'

1474
01:35:42,125 --> 01:35:47,333
'Like a piece of paper 
that flutters in the air...'

1475
01:35:47,458 --> 01:35:52,708
'...why did you move away from me, 
O dear girl?'

1476
01:35:52,833 --> 01:35:58,083
'Mistaking a mirage 
to be an image of true love...'

1477
01:35:58,208 --> 01:36:03,791
'...I sought it out, 
but it was for all naught!'

1478
01:36:03,916 --> 01:36:09,000
'Two eyes are not sufficient!'

1479
01:36:09,125 --> 01:36:14,041
'A million eyes, I have not to cry!'

1480
01:36:14,166 --> 01:36:19,458
'Eyelids, far from the eyes! 
Memories, far from the heart!'

1481
01:36:19,583 --> 01:36:23,708
'And life? Far from the body!'

1482
01:36:24,916 --> 01:36:30,041
'Fall to the ground, 
did one flower of a pair in a plant!'

1483
01:36:30,166 --> 01:36:34,541
'Despite this fall, 
can they ever unite again?'

1484
01:36:57,416 --> 01:37:02,583
'The moments I lived with you...'

1485
01:37:02,708 --> 01:37:07,833
'...lie shattered like glass!'

1486
01:37:07,958 --> 01:37:13,291
'All the memories we made together...'

1487
01:37:13,416 --> 01:37:18,083
'...flashed before my eyes, one by one!'

1488
01:37:18,208 --> 01:37:23,708
'If we get everything we sought...'

1489
01:37:23,833 --> 01:37:29,041
'...realize this pain, 
the heart will not!'

1490
01:37:29,166 --> 01:37:34,458
'If we enjoy anything we receive...'

1491
01:37:34,583 --> 01:37:39,333
'...cry not, will a single eye!'

1492
01:37:39,458 --> 01:37:44,750
'Is my anger, my love? 
Is your silence, your love?'

1493
01:37:44,875 --> 01:37:48,958
'We go about without realizing that!'

1494
01:37:50,208 --> 01:37:55,416
'One word of a mine, should suffice. 
As will one word of yours, in response.'

1495
01:37:55,541 --> 01:37:59,750
'All will turn upside down! 
Speak, my girl.'

1496
01:38:01,166 --> 01:38:06,041
'Like a piece of paper 
that flutters in the air...'

1497
01:38:06,166 --> 01:38:11,166
'...why did you move away from me, 
O dear girl?'

1498
01:38:11,291 --> 01:38:16,750
'Mistaking a mirage 
to be an image of true love...'

1499
01:38:16,875 --> 01:38:22,291
'...I sought it out, 
but it was for all naught!'

1500
01:38:22,416 --> 01:38:27,958
'Two eyes are not sufficient!'

1501
01:38:28,083 --> 01:38:32,833
'A million eyes, I have not to cry!'

1502
01:38:32,958 --> 01:38:38,000
'Eyelids, far from the eyes! 
Memories, far from the heart!'

1503
01:38:38,125 --> 01:38:41,833
'And life? Far from the body!'

1504
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:48,708
'Fall to the ground, 
did one flower of a pair in a plant!'

1505
01:38:48,833 --> 01:38:52,750
'Despite this fall, 
can they ever unite again?'

1506
01:38:57,541 --> 01:38:58,583
In this invitation...

1507
01:39:00,250 --> 01:39:02,125
...I wished for Balu and Maha's names...

1508
01:39:03,583 --> 01:39:06,041
...to be together.

1509
01:39:07,875 --> 01:39:09,750
The fact that it ended up just a dream...

1510
01:39:11,916 --> 01:39:13,833
...was something I never expected.

1511
01:39:13,958 --> 01:39:15,375
Some dreams are like that, mom.

1512
01:39:16,375 --> 01:39:18,083
They remain just that. Dreams.

1513
01:39:19,333 --> 01:39:22,041
You wanted to be together with dad, too.

1514
01:39:22,166 --> 01:39:24,416
That... didn't happen, either.

1515
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:27,208
This is just like that, mom.

1516
01:39:38,125 --> 01:39:41,666
This is the first auspicious event 
in our family.

1517
01:39:43,541 --> 01:39:45,958
It must not happen 
without your grandpa's presence.

1518
01:39:48,500 --> 01:39:49,833
This first invitation...

1519
01:39:50,833 --> 01:39:54,416
...must be given to him. 
Could you to tell him I want him there?

1520
01:39:55,541 --> 01:39:57,583
I'm not in a position to do it myself.

1521
01:39:58,750 --> 01:40:01,125
Tell your grandpa that's why 
I couldn't come.

1522
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:04,625
No matter what...

1523
01:40:04,750 --> 01:40:07,750
...don't tell him 
that I'm in a critical condition!

1524
01:40:21,583 --> 01:40:23,666
Mop! Put that luggage in my car!

1525
01:40:23,791 --> 01:40:25,083
Keep it in my car, Mop!

1526
01:40:26,416 --> 01:40:28,541
Laugh it out, Mop! 
-Why?

1527
01:40:28,666 --> 01:40:31,750
The thought of travelling 500 kilometres 
by auto-rickshaw. That's why!

1528
01:40:32,500 --> 01:40:35,125
Tell him not to comment about my car!

1529
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:40,958
The two of you seem like 
an angry couple after marriage!

1530
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,500
What is your problem, now? 
About which car to use, yes?

1531
01:40:44,625 --> 01:40:47,041
I have a technique in America. 
What's it called?

1532
01:40:47,166 --> 01:40:49,458
The 'RRT'! 
Robert Ramaiah Technique!

1533
01:40:50,541 --> 01:40:52,291
Please come and put your key here!

1534
01:40:55,791 --> 01:40:58,166
Hey, Maha! 
Come and do the same!

1535
01:41:02,916 --> 01:41:04,875
Now, I'll shuffle them!

1536
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:06,666
And that will solve your problem!

1537
01:41:17,291 --> 01:41:19,375
Keep it in there! 
-Sure thing!

1538
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:21,250
What's wrong with him?

1539
01:41:21,375 --> 01:41:22,375
Let's go!

1540
01:41:29,458 --> 01:41:30,833
You moron!

1541
01:41:30,958 --> 01:41:33,041
Let's move! 
-Hey, family employee!

1542
01:41:33,166 --> 01:41:34,708
Why keep the luggage in my car?

1543
01:41:34,833 --> 01:41:37,458
Per the Robert Ramaiah technique, 
your car was selected!

1544
01:41:39,708 --> 01:41:43,958
The doctor who sought to treat a patient, 
has become a patient himself!

1545
01:41:44,083 --> 01:41:45,541
Ask her to drive, Mop!

1546
01:41:45,666 --> 01:41:46,791
I won't drive!

1547
01:41:46,916 --> 01:41:48,666
I can't drive either, bro!

1548
01:41:48,791 --> 01:41:50,541
Why fight over this, you two?

1549
01:41:50,666 --> 01:41:53,083
He's idling by! Let him drive! 
-"Idling by?"

1550
01:41:54,458 --> 01:41:57,291
I'm not a driver! 
I'm the owner of this Benz car!

1551
01:41:57,416 --> 01:41:59,500
Owner, right? Then drive! 
-I don't know how!

1552
01:41:59,625 --> 01:42:02,000
Then why buy a car? 
-Was a desire. For status.

1553
01:42:03,791 --> 01:42:06,208
What? 
-Thank goodness you didn't get married!

1554
01:42:07,250 --> 01:42:08,375
I'll skewer you later!

1555
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:10,416
I won't agree to that! 
-Crap!

1556
01:42:12,083 --> 01:42:15,416
If you fight like this before leaving, 
won't my car get into an accident?

1557
01:42:15,541 --> 01:42:16,916
What is the problem, now?

1558
01:42:17,041 --> 01:42:20,125
All because the two of you 
know each other, right? Put that aside!

1559
01:42:20,250 --> 01:42:24,916
From this moment on, the two of you 
are new flowers from different gardens!

1560
01:42:37,166 --> 01:42:39,333
Your name isn't Balu.

1561
01:42:39,458 --> 01:42:41,250
It's Sharukh. 
Sharukh Khan!

1562
01:42:42,291 --> 01:42:44,166
Why are you laughing? 
Don't like my idea?

1563
01:42:44,916 --> 01:42:46,375
The idea is fine.

1564
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:49,000
But the fact that you called him Sharukh 
made me laugh!

1565
01:42:50,333 --> 01:42:52,666
From this moment, your name isn't Maha. 
It's Kajol!

1566
01:42:53,750 --> 01:42:54,791
Why are you laughing?

1567
01:42:54,916 --> 01:42:57,000
Just that it's hard to see her 
as 'Kajol'.

1568
01:42:57,833 --> 01:43:00,458
Thought you wouldn't fight 
if I changed your names...

1569
01:43:00,583 --> 01:43:02,250
...but you fight 
when I change them!

1570
01:43:02,375 --> 01:43:05,041
You drive for the first 3 hours! 
You drive for the next 3 hours!

1571
01:43:05,166 --> 01:43:07,041
Please take good care of my car!

1572
01:43:52,250 --> 01:43:53,375
How is the car, Balu?

1573
01:43:53,500 --> 01:43:54,750
What about it? 
It's fine.

1574
01:43:57,500 --> 01:44:00,625
Had a feeling of an organ being ripped 
and flung out of my body!

1575
01:44:01,625 --> 01:44:03,666
Is that so? 
-Yes. Tell Maha that I said 'hi'!

1576
01:44:03,791 --> 01:44:05,541
Turn on the radio if you guys get bored.

1577
01:44:05,666 --> 01:44:06,833
Your journey will be fun!

1578
01:44:06,958 --> 01:44:09,291
That's what we're listening to. 
The sound is epic!

1579
01:44:10,291 --> 01:44:11,291
It's epic?

1580
01:44:11,416 --> 01:44:13,875
I can't hear anything! 
It's shivering, here!

1581
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:17,166
Since you're pretty far off, 
that's why you can't hear it.

1582
01:44:21,166 --> 01:44:23,875
What's in the car isn't an engine, 
but my heart!

1583
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:27,291
The notion of pressing the accelerator 
too hard might hurt the car...

1584
01:44:27,416 --> 01:44:29,333
...was why I never learnt to drive!

1585
01:44:30,333 --> 01:44:32,166
Take care, kiddo. 
Be safe.

1586
01:44:32,291 --> 01:44:34,291
Fine, I'll take care. 
-Happy journey!

1587
01:44:35,333 --> 01:44:36,333
To my car!

1588
01:45:27,875 --> 01:45:29,583
Who do you think you're messing with?

1589
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:51,791
Hey, stop the car! 
-Why?

1590
01:45:53,333 --> 01:45:54,791
Must I tell you everything?

1591
01:45:59,750 --> 01:46:01,291
I'll take a leak and be right back.

1592
01:46:05,791 --> 01:46:06,958
Why did you keep driving?

1593
01:46:09,750 --> 01:46:11,333
Are you going to stop the car or not?

1594
01:46:18,708 --> 01:46:20,875
She's increasing the air-conditioning, too!

1595
01:46:25,333 --> 01:46:27,416
This guy is torturing me, too!

1596
01:46:28,250 --> 01:46:29,916
It's me, Balu! 
All smooth?

1597
01:46:31,166 --> 01:46:35,375
Think it'll flow smoothly, 
but she just won't let me!

1598
01:46:35,500 --> 01:46:38,041
Careful. 
In your squabble, the car might take a hit!

1599
01:46:38,166 --> 01:46:39,625
The flowing fuel will be useless!

1600
01:46:39,750 --> 01:46:41,958
Nothing of that sort!

1601
01:46:42,083 --> 01:46:44,708
But, she's going without letting 
my stuff flow!

1602
01:46:45,416 --> 01:46:46,458
Hang up!

1603
01:46:47,541 --> 01:46:49,000
Am I disturbing him too much?

1604
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
I tossed away the bottle, too!

1605
01:46:52,125 --> 01:46:53,125
You witch!

1606
01:46:54,541 --> 01:46:56,166
Want me to pull over?

1607
01:46:56,291 --> 01:46:58,333
Say "That is Mahalakshmi" 
and I'll do it.

1608
01:46:59,416 --> 01:47:01,958
You needn't pull over. 
I know how to make you do it.

1609
01:47:08,541 --> 01:47:10,500
Don't! 
What are you doing?

1610
01:47:10,625 --> 01:47:12,916
Don't you have any sense? 
-Go get it!

1611
01:47:15,625 --> 01:47:16,625
I can't hold it in!

1612
01:47:17,666 --> 01:47:19,250
Run! Run! Run!

1613
01:47:21,250 --> 01:47:23,000
No one is around to see this!

1614
01:47:43,125 --> 01:47:45,166
Hey, Sharukh! 
-Yes, tell me!

1615
01:47:46,625 --> 01:47:48,833
You're living the character! 
Great!

1616
01:47:55,625 --> 01:47:57,208
How is the journey? 
-All fine.

1617
01:47:58,083 --> 01:47:59,541
But, the legs really hurt.

1618
01:47:59,666 --> 01:48:02,541
The legs hurt? 
How can that be if you're going by car?

1619
01:48:02,666 --> 01:48:05,583
Or did you press the accelerator so hard 
that it hurt your leg?

1620
01:48:05,708 --> 01:48:06,916
I don't get it, Sharukh.

1621
01:48:07,041 --> 01:48:10,083
To make it clearer for you, 
you're must do something right away.

1622
01:48:10,208 --> 01:48:11,750
Tell me! 
I'll do it immediately!

1623
01:48:11,875 --> 01:48:14,750
Quickly take a call taxi 
and go to a nearby hospital!

1624
01:48:17,583 --> 01:48:19,708
What happened to Kajol? 
Tell me, Sharukh!

1625
01:48:20,708 --> 01:48:22,041
I'm fine!

1626
01:48:22,166 --> 01:48:24,583
But, you go to the hospital. 
And hurry!

1627
01:48:24,708 --> 01:48:28,000
Why? Tell me clearly! 
-I just told you to go! Hurry!

1628
01:48:28,125 --> 01:48:29,833
Go to the hospital right away! 
-Taxi!

1629
01:48:36,083 --> 01:48:38,708
I've reached the hospital! 
Now tell me what to do!

1630
01:48:38,833 --> 01:48:41,041
I'll tell you. 
Don't get agitated!

1631
01:48:41,166 --> 01:48:43,166
Locate the emergency ward 
and go in there!

1632
01:48:43,291 --> 01:48:45,333
The emergency ward? 
Where is that thing?

1633
01:48:45,458 --> 01:48:47,333
Hurry up! 
Faster!

1634
01:48:47,458 --> 01:48:51,000
I'm moving faster than an ambulance, 
Kajol! It's over there!

1635
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,708
Emergency! 
This is the room!

1636
01:48:54,833 --> 01:48:56,875
I've reached the emergency ward!

1637
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:58,791
Is there an empty bed over there? 
-Yes!

1638
01:48:58,916 --> 01:48:59,916
Sit down on it!

1639
01:49:00,041 --> 01:49:02,666
Why is he telling me to sit 
on a patient's bed?

1640
01:49:02,791 --> 01:49:03,833
Okay, I've sat on it!

1641
01:49:03,958 --> 01:49:05,250
Quickly call the doctor!

1642
01:49:08,625 --> 01:49:10,916
I called for a doctor thrice, 
and three of you show up?

1643
01:49:11,041 --> 01:49:12,666
Doctors are here! 
Must I call nurses?

1644
01:49:12,791 --> 01:49:14,208
There's no need for that.

1645
01:49:14,333 --> 01:49:16,375
I'm going to tell you 
two important things.

1646
01:49:16,500 --> 01:49:19,625
Go ahead. 
-First is for you. Second is for doctors.

1647
01:49:19,750 --> 01:49:21,291
Tell me everything, dear boy!

1648
01:49:21,416 --> 01:49:23,166
And I'll intimate the doctors!

1649
01:49:23,291 --> 01:49:26,750
Just that if I tell you the first thing, 
you won't be able to hear the second.

1650
01:49:26,875 --> 01:49:28,208
Tell me the second, first!

1651
01:49:28,333 --> 01:49:30,166
Put the phone on speaker. 
-Speaker?

1652
01:49:31,666 --> 01:49:32,666
You're on speaker!

1653
01:49:34,250 --> 01:49:36,125
My uncle's about to have 
a heart attack!

1654
01:49:36,250 --> 01:49:38,750
Take good care of him. 
He is very important to us!

1655
01:49:38,875 --> 01:49:40,291
He seems fine, sir! 
-Hey!

1656
01:49:40,416 --> 01:49:43,125
Don't get started. 
The kid always jokes around with me!

1657
01:49:43,250 --> 01:49:45,250
Tell me the first thing quickly, dear boy!

1658
01:49:47,708 --> 01:49:49,208
Your car...

1659
01:49:50,250 --> 01:49:51,333
...has been wrecked!

1660
01:49:57,583 --> 01:50:00,000
Can you do a small favor for me, 
Sharukh?

1661
01:50:00,125 --> 01:50:01,416
Yes, tell me.

1662
01:50:01,541 --> 01:50:04,125
Pretend to be Balu 
in grandpa's presence.

1663
01:50:04,250 --> 01:50:05,291
Can you do it?

1664
01:50:05,416 --> 01:50:06,416
Is that all?

1665
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:08,833
Kajol, I need a favor from you, as well.

1666
01:50:08,958 --> 01:50:12,541
What? I must pretend to be Mahalakshmi 
before grandpa, am I right?

1667
01:50:19,791 --> 01:50:21,583
I built roads for this town!

1668
01:50:21,708 --> 01:50:24,458
I built schools for this town! 
I built hospitals, too!

1669
01:50:24,583 --> 01:50:27,875
Forgetting all that, you claim that 
some schmuck named Ambani is great?

1670
01:50:29,083 --> 01:50:31,041
Grandpa! 
-No, sir. You are the great one!

1671
01:50:31,166 --> 01:50:32,916
You admit it because I hit you?

1672
01:50:33,041 --> 01:50:35,708
Why start a fight over this? 
I admitted it, right?

1673
01:50:35,833 --> 01:50:38,166
So you admit it 
because I fought you, right?

1674
01:50:38,291 --> 01:50:39,791
Same genes!

1675
01:50:43,916 --> 01:50:47,583
Listen up! I won't pay a single penny 
for this year's festival!

1676
01:50:47,708 --> 01:50:50,958
Get your funding 
from that great Ambani chap!

1677
01:50:51,083 --> 01:50:52,458
What? 
-Hold on, sir.

1678
01:50:52,583 --> 01:50:55,833
Every year, you put out a great festival! 
How can you drop such a bombshell?

1679
01:50:55,958 --> 01:50:58,875
You're the oldest person 
in this town. No, in this district!

1680
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:00,750
How can you say this? 
-What? "Oldest"?

1681
01:51:00,875 --> 01:51:03,250
Telling me I've aged? 
'Cause my moustache is greyed?

1682
01:51:03,375 --> 01:51:05,125
Nothing like that, sir. 
Let it go.

1683
01:51:05,250 --> 01:51:07,375
I've even asked the dancers to come 
by auto!

1684
01:51:07,500 --> 01:51:09,500
Why by auto? 
Could've arranged ten lorries!

1685
01:51:10,791 --> 01:51:12,375
Now who are you going to call 'great'?

1686
01:51:12,500 --> 01:51:14,458
Grandkids are here! 
-Whose grandkids?

1687
01:51:14,583 --> 01:51:16,833
The son of your son 
and daughter of your daughter.

1688
01:51:28,333 --> 01:51:29,333
Let's go!

1689
01:51:29,458 --> 01:51:31,916
Grandpa! 
-Why is he leaving angrily?

1690
01:51:32,041 --> 01:51:34,083
Hold on, grandpa! 
-He does everything well.

1691
01:51:34,208 --> 01:51:35,708
This anger... 
-Grandpa!

1692
01:51:35,833 --> 01:51:38,666
Open the door, grandpa!

1693
01:51:38,791 --> 01:51:40,708
Come on out, grandpa! 
Please!

1694
01:51:40,833 --> 01:51:43,375
Please listen to what we have to say, 
for just a minute!

1695
01:51:43,500 --> 01:51:44,625
Talk to us, grandpa!

1696
01:51:44,750 --> 01:51:46,541
I have no relatives. 
I know no one!

1697
01:51:46,666 --> 01:51:47,833
Please leave!

1698
01:51:47,958 --> 01:51:49,000
Tell them to leave!

1699
01:51:49,125 --> 01:51:52,041
My name is Balu Mahendra, grandpa. 
Same as yours!

1700
01:51:52,166 --> 01:51:54,791
Yes, grandpa. 
My name is Mahalakshmi, too!

1701
01:51:54,916 --> 01:51:55,916
Grandma's name!

1702
01:51:57,166 --> 01:51:58,166
Be quiet!

1703
01:51:58,291 --> 01:52:02,083
So? That old lady wants to know 
if I'm alive or dead, right?

1704
01:52:02,958 --> 01:52:05,083
Ask them to leave, Muruga!

1705
01:52:05,208 --> 01:52:07,291
No, grandpa! 
We're both getting married!

1706
01:52:07,416 --> 01:52:09,625
She asked us to give you 
the first invitation!

1707
01:52:09,750 --> 01:52:12,916
Yes! As it is the first auspicious event 
of our household...

1708
01:52:13,041 --> 01:52:17,875
...grandma sent us over 
to give you the first invitation!

1709
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:19,666
That's why we're here, grandpa!

1710
01:52:21,333 --> 01:52:22,416
What?

1711
01:52:22,541 --> 01:52:25,083
The two of you are getting married? 
-Yes!

1712
01:52:25,208 --> 01:52:27,250
My darlings!

1713
01:52:27,375 --> 01:52:29,333
My grandkids are getting married!

1714
01:52:31,416 --> 01:52:32,750
Come along!

1715
01:52:34,708 --> 01:52:36,125
What is this, dear girl?

1716
01:52:36,250 --> 01:52:38,125
Why is your face so glum?

1717
01:52:38,250 --> 01:52:40,458
It is very good news. 
Let everyone hear it. Read!

1718
01:52:45,458 --> 01:52:49,791
"A wedding invite from the home 
of Mr. Balu and Ms. Mahalakshmi."

1719
01:52:49,916 --> 01:52:51,916
What is this? 
Your dad named you after me!

1720
01:52:52,041 --> 01:52:54,708
Dad didn't name me, grandpa. 
Grandma did!

1721
01:52:54,833 --> 01:52:55,833
Terrific.

1722
01:52:56,833 --> 01:52:57,833
Keep reading.

1723
01:52:58,375 --> 01:53:00,791
"In the upcoming auspicious year 
of 'Hevilambi'..."

1724
01:53:00,916 --> 01:53:03,333
"...on the 10th day of the 'Thai' month, 
a Friday..."

1725
01:53:03,458 --> 01:53:06,208
"...from 7:30 AM to 9:00 AM..."

1726
01:53:06,333 --> 01:53:09,208
"...my son Subramaniam's 
only son..."

1727
01:53:09,333 --> 01:53:12,875
"...the honorable groom 
Mr. Balu Mahendra..."

1728
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,041
"...and the honorable bride 
Ms..."

1729
01:53:19,041 --> 01:53:21,666
"The honorable bride, Ms..."

1730
01:53:21,791 --> 01:53:23,083
Give me that.

1731
01:53:23,208 --> 01:53:26,166
"...and the honorable bride 
Ms. Mahalakshmi..."

1732
01:53:26,291 --> 01:53:28,916
"...are set to be united 
by the bounds of holy matrimony."

1733
01:53:32,958 --> 01:53:35,500
Did you hear what Balu just read, grandpa?

1734
01:53:38,708 --> 01:53:40,250
I couldn't hear it clearly.

1735
01:53:40,375 --> 01:53:41,791
Did all of you hear it?

1736
01:53:41,916 --> 01:53:43,541
Yes, sir. We heard it.

1737
01:53:43,666 --> 01:53:45,833
Did you hear it? 
-We heard what you said, sir.

1738
01:53:45,958 --> 01:53:48,625
But, we didn't hear what the boy said! 
-I figured!

1739
01:53:49,750 --> 01:53:52,375
Dear boy, why swallow most of the words?

1740
01:53:52,500 --> 01:53:55,041
Let the entire town hear this great news. 
Read it aloud!

1741
01:54:00,708 --> 01:54:03,333
"...and the honorable bride, 
Ms. Mahalakshmi..."

1742
01:54:03,458 --> 01:54:06,208
"...will be united by the bonds 
of holy matrimony."

1743
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:14,000
The donation, sir...

1744
01:54:14,125 --> 01:54:16,416
Why bother roaming about town 
for this anymore?

1745
01:54:19,500 --> 01:54:20,875
Here! 
Hold on a second!

1746
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:24,208
Give this with your hands, Balu. 
For the temple festival.

1747
01:54:27,125 --> 01:54:28,125
Thank you, dear boy.

1748
01:54:28,250 --> 01:54:32,125
Listen up! This year's festival must be 
more special than anything we had before!

1749
01:54:32,250 --> 01:54:36,958
'Strange things are occurring 
in this town!'

1750
01:54:39,791 --> 01:54:44,458
'There is no one here 
to listen to these tales!'

1751
01:54:45,458 --> 01:54:49,875
'Listen to the story of Kamatchi! 
Lend me your ears!'

1752
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,291
Hit it! 
Hit it, I said!

1753
01:54:58,875 --> 01:55:01,958
'A gem encrusted nose ring 
and a two layered necklace...'

1754
01:55:02,083 --> 01:55:04,916
'...he bought from a moneylender 
just for me!'

1755
01:55:05,041 --> 01:55:08,333
'A five rupee colored dot vase 
and a ten rupee powder case...'

1756
01:55:08,458 --> 01:55:11,291
'...he bought lovingly, 
just for me!'

1757
01:55:11,416 --> 01:55:14,750
'Glass bangles 
and shiny anklets for my feet...'

1758
01:55:14,875 --> 01:55:17,666
'...shrewdly he bought, 
only for me!'

1759
01:55:17,791 --> 01:55:21,125
'For a mere ten lakh rupees...'

1760
01:55:21,250 --> 01:55:24,333
'...sold me off to a toothless old man, 
did my husband!'

1761
01:55:24,458 --> 01:55:27,583
'Should you give me your 'mama' 
just for one night...'

1762
01:55:27,708 --> 01:55:30,708
'...my thirst will be quenched!'

1763
01:55:30,833 --> 01:55:33,875
'Should we engage 
in such a dainty relationship...'

1764
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:37,208
'...my mood will be restored! 
Will you give him to me?'

1765
01:55:37,333 --> 01:55:40,333
'I won't give up my 'mama' 
to anyone!'

1766
01:55:40,458 --> 01:55:43,375
'So shut up and get lost!'

1767
01:55:43,500 --> 01:55:46,750
'Men are plenty in this town!'

1768
01:55:46,875 --> 01:55:49,250
'Go look for them in every home!'

1769
01:55:50,500 --> 01:55:52,666
'As it turns out, the next story...'

1770
01:55:52,791 --> 01:55:56,375
'...is that of every man 
who married a pretty woman.'

1771
01:55:56,500 --> 01:55:59,000
'A story of one who always suspects 
his wife of infidelity!'

1772
01:55:59,125 --> 01:56:01,958
'Here is Sevvandhi, 
who is caught in such a tussle!'

1773
01:56:02,083 --> 01:56:03,791
Come on! 
Come out and tell them, dear!

1774
01:56:15,333 --> 01:56:17,958
'Hearing the mere sound of my anklets...'

1775
01:56:18,083 --> 01:56:20,583
'...causes him to suspect 
my movements!'

1776
01:56:21,250 --> 01:56:23,416
'Hearing the mere sound of my bangles...'

1777
01:56:23,541 --> 01:56:26,083
'...makes him ask which other man 
I'm looking to trap!'

1778
01:56:26,208 --> 01:56:29,208
'Should a mosquito come and bite me...'

1779
01:56:29,333 --> 01:56:31,916
'...he asks which man 
performed this lecherous act!'

1780
01:56:32,041 --> 01:56:35,041
'Even if a man 
smiles at me on the road...'

1781
01:56:35,166 --> 01:56:37,833
'...my husband asks 
if I'm sleeping with him, too!'

1782
01:56:37,958 --> 01:56:40,208
'Give me your 'mama!', dear!'

1783
01:56:40,333 --> 01:56:43,041
'I'll have my fun with him 
and return him to you!'

1784
01:56:43,166 --> 01:56:45,750
'Get away from here 
as fast as you can!'

1785
01:56:45,875 --> 01:56:48,666
'For I was born for him!'

1786
01:56:49,375 --> 01:56:53,041
'The husbands whose wives 
work abroad...'

1787
01:56:53,166 --> 01:56:56,083
'Do you know what they do in town?'

1788
01:57:05,833 --> 01:57:07,083
What happened, Sharukh?

1789
01:57:07,208 --> 01:57:09,125
It's Balu's problem. 
Doesn't concern us.

1790
01:57:09,250 --> 01:57:13,583
'For a hefty salary, 
he sent me over to Dubai!'

1791
01:57:13,708 --> 01:57:17,875
'To buy a television and refrigerator, 
sent over money, I did!'

1792
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:22,208
'Bought him the bed and sofa set 
that he asked for!'

1793
01:57:22,333 --> 01:57:26,541
'Asked for a house in East Coast Road, 
he did! Bought him that, too!'

1794
01:57:26,666 --> 01:57:30,625
'Came down to settle down 
with my dearest husband!'

1795
01:57:30,750 --> 01:57:34,333
'Atop the bed I bought for him, 
was another woman!'

1796
01:57:34,458 --> 01:57:38,541
'Do not give your 'mama' 
to anyone!'

1797
01:57:38,666 --> 01:57:42,041
'Do not end up as a fool, 
like I did!'

1798
01:57:42,166 --> 01:57:46,416
'I will not give my 'mama' 
to anyone!'

1799
01:57:46,541 --> 01:57:50,625
'I will not even let 
the scent of another woman near him!'

1800
01:58:08,875 --> 01:58:10,708
What is she doing?

1801
01:58:13,125 --> 01:58:15,625
What is this? 
Is this really necessary for her?

1802
01:58:15,750 --> 01:58:17,416
She's pretty enough as it is!

1803
01:58:19,500 --> 01:58:22,166
She's putting a sack load of powder 
on her face!

1804
01:58:25,625 --> 01:58:27,625
I can't watch this, dear boy!

1805
01:58:27,750 --> 01:58:30,375
Fast forward! 
Keep fast-forwarding!

1806
01:58:34,916 --> 01:58:36,500
Everyone is together.

1807
01:58:39,375 --> 01:58:43,083
How about that? 
A birthday party at her age?

1808
01:58:44,166 --> 01:58:46,041
Cake is a bit much, don't you think?

1809
01:58:50,875 --> 01:58:52,375
Like a doll in a jewelry store!

1810
01:58:55,083 --> 01:58:56,500
Mom! 
-Grandma!

1811
01:58:56,625 --> 01:58:58,041
What happened, mom?

1812
01:58:59,416 --> 01:59:01,166
What is this? 
What happened to her?

1813
01:59:02,416 --> 01:59:04,958
Did you take her to a hospital? 
-She's fine. Don't worry.

1814
01:59:05,083 --> 01:59:06,875
Is she alright? 
-Yes, she's fine.

1815
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:10,791
What button must I press 
to see her again?

1816
01:59:10,916 --> 01:59:11,916
This button.

1817
01:59:18,458 --> 01:59:19,708
How is she...

1818
01:59:31,791 --> 01:59:32,791
Why all this?

1819
01:59:34,416 --> 01:59:35,416
Why must I go there?

1820
01:59:39,583 --> 01:59:40,958
Why must I come there?

1821
01:59:42,708 --> 01:59:44,208
Tell me why I must come there.

1822
01:59:45,083 --> 01:59:49,416
I do not have the willpower 
to see her like this.

1823
01:59:50,708 --> 01:59:51,916
I can't do it.

1824
01:59:52,041 --> 01:59:54,291
Must I travel so far 
to see her in that state?

1825
01:59:58,541 --> 01:59:59,541
Grandpa...

1826
02:00:11,708 --> 02:00:12,708
Look.

1827
02:00:13,833 --> 02:00:14,833
Look, dear.

1828
02:00:16,083 --> 02:00:18,750
Mahalakshmi. 
Just like the goddess.

1829
02:00:20,541 --> 02:00:21,541
But, now?

1830
02:00:22,958 --> 02:00:23,958
No need.

1831
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:29,208
I'll stay back here 
with these memories to keep me company.

1832
02:00:30,666 --> 02:00:32,000
I won't come.

1833
02:00:34,041 --> 02:00:36,000
I'll make do 
with these memories.

1834
02:00:37,416 --> 02:00:38,625
That's good enough for me.

1835
02:00:39,625 --> 02:00:43,291
What? Want to know what button 
to press to watch this again, right?

1836
02:00:48,625 --> 02:00:50,250
No...

1837
02:00:50,375 --> 02:00:54,125
Kumar here. 
-I'll stay behind with these memories...

1838
02:00:54,250 --> 02:00:56,166
The call's for you. 
-Who is it?

1839
02:00:56,291 --> 02:00:57,666
I won't come. 
-Tell me.

1840
02:00:57,791 --> 02:01:00,541
Everyone's waiting for you here, Balu.

1841
02:01:00,666 --> 02:01:02,500
If you hurry, we can start the meeting.

1842
02:01:02,625 --> 02:01:04,291
How many times must I tell you?

1843
02:01:04,416 --> 02:01:06,000
Grandma... 
-Do you understand me?

1844
02:01:06,125 --> 02:01:07,541
No need for a meeting!

1845
02:01:07,666 --> 02:01:10,208
Close everything. 
I can't come over there right now!

1846
02:01:11,666 --> 02:01:13,208
How are you? 
-I'm fine.

1847
02:01:14,041 --> 02:01:15,708
How many times... 
-How was your trip?

1848
02:01:17,083 --> 02:01:18,625
How is your grandfather?

1849
02:01:18,750 --> 02:01:19,750
He's doing very well.

1850
02:01:21,541 --> 02:01:24,208
I don't want anything. 
Just shut it all down and leave.

1851
02:01:27,083 --> 02:01:29,625
That's why I got a special gift for you.

1852
02:01:32,041 --> 02:01:34,041
Without even seeing it, you say it's nice?

1853
02:01:37,541 --> 02:01:39,250
No, dad. I can't stand the pressure.

1854
02:01:43,375 --> 02:01:45,833
You often say that one thing, right? 
Say it now.

1855
02:01:47,958 --> 02:01:50,041
What? 
-That thing you often say.

1856
02:01:50,166 --> 02:01:51,875
Say what? 
-That thing!

1857
02:01:53,041 --> 02:01:54,041
I'm fine, uncle.

1858
02:01:55,875 --> 02:01:56,875
Your father.

1859
02:01:59,375 --> 02:02:02,000
Alright, Maha. 
Honestly speaking, do you like this?

1860
02:02:04,750 --> 02:02:06,458
Tell me, dad. 
-When do we go shopping?

1861
02:02:07,500 --> 02:02:08,875
What happened to Balu, uncle?

1862
02:02:10,958 --> 02:02:13,833
Balu had signed a deal 
with a cell phone company.

1863
02:02:14,708 --> 02:02:17,875
For that project, he tirelessly worked 
on developing a software.

1864
02:02:18,625 --> 02:02:21,708
And that Prakash, 
you know, his business partner...

1865
02:02:21,833 --> 02:02:25,416
...sold it to another cell phone company, 
without Balu's knowledge.

1866
02:02:25,541 --> 02:02:29,500
The original cell phone company's 
considering filing a case against Balu.

1867
02:02:32,875 --> 02:02:35,916
If an explanation isn't given 
in fifteen days...

1868
02:02:36,041 --> 02:02:38,375
...they said he will have to pay a penalty.

1869
02:02:38,500 --> 02:02:41,000
Don't know if we can raise the money 
for the penalty fee...

1870
02:02:41,125 --> 02:02:44,166
...even if we sell our entire property.

1871
02:02:44,291 --> 02:02:46,416
That's why Balu is at a loss 
for what he can do.

1872
02:03:18,250 --> 02:03:19,875
What are you all doing?

1873
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,125
Working on 'regaining' 
our application work.

1874
02:03:22,250 --> 02:03:23,541
Who told you to do this?

1875
02:03:23,666 --> 02:03:26,166
The new programming manager 
told us to do so.

1876
02:03:31,750 --> 02:03:34,375
Come on in. 
We've been waiting for you.

1877
02:03:34,500 --> 02:03:36,125
We have fifteen days.

1878
02:03:36,250 --> 02:03:39,208
We can develop an advanced version 
of the tech that Prakash stole.

1879
02:03:39,333 --> 02:03:42,458
Guide us. 
We're all ready to work together.

1880
02:03:42,583 --> 02:03:45,375
If we work hard, 
we can develop a new project...

1881
02:03:45,500 --> 02:03:48,708
...that'll shock that cell phone company! 
What are you thinking?

1882
02:03:48,833 --> 02:03:50,291
There's no time to think!

1883
02:03:50,416 --> 02:03:53,500
Only if we work day and night, 
can we finish this project.

1884
02:03:53,625 --> 02:03:55,041
Who asked you to come here?

1885
02:03:55,916 --> 02:03:57,750
I just came by to help you...

1886
02:03:57,875 --> 02:03:59,833
I don't need anyone's help. 
Get out.

1887
02:04:20,791 --> 02:04:22,041
Mahalakshmi speaking.

1888
02:04:22,875 --> 02:04:25,875
You said I could call you 
anytime I needed a job, right?

1889
02:04:27,375 --> 02:04:28,375
I need a job right now.

1890
02:04:28,500 --> 02:04:30,666
If you have no job to give, tell me. 
I'll leave.

1891
02:04:30,791 --> 02:04:32,583
What are you thinking about?

1892
02:04:32,708 --> 02:04:34,416
Do you have a job to spare or not?

1893
02:04:34,541 --> 02:04:35,541
Alright, come on in.

1894
02:05:32,250 --> 02:05:35,875
'You stood all over my heart.'

1895
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,541
'You won over all my memories.'

1896
02:05:38,666 --> 02:05:41,000
'Leaving me behind, you walked away.'

1897
02:05:42,208 --> 02:05:46,500
'Vanishing not, 
you appeared before my eyes.'

1898
02:05:46,625 --> 02:05:49,291
'Within my eyes, you stayed.'

1899
02:05:49,416 --> 02:05:51,833
'Like a dream, you faded away.'

1900
02:05:52,958 --> 02:05:57,416
'Even if lost, 
the sky will not be gone.'

1901
02:05:58,458 --> 02:06:02,583
'In the same vein, 
our love will never change!'

1902
02:06:02,708 --> 02:06:07,916
'Even if you leave my side, 
our bond shall never break.'

1903
02:06:08,041 --> 02:06:13,250
'Even if I die, 
our love shall never change.'

1904
02:06:13,375 --> 02:06:18,583
'No matter what the heart says, 
it will not forget you.'

1905
02:06:18,708 --> 02:06:23,625
'Wounds may heal, 
but scars remain forever.'

1906
02:06:51,041 --> 02:06:53,083
When did you get here, Ajay? 
You didn't call.

1907
02:06:53,208 --> 02:06:54,750
More like you didn't answer.

1908
02:06:56,250 --> 02:06:57,500
I was tied at work.

1909
02:06:57,625 --> 02:06:59,291
Just wait. 
I'll go freshen up.

1910
02:07:00,375 --> 02:07:01,791
Do you know what the time is now?

1911
02:07:01,916 --> 02:07:03,000
It's 3:30 AM.

1912
02:07:03,125 --> 02:07:06,791
With our wedding in two days, 
you coming this late is not nice at all.

1913
02:07:06,916 --> 02:07:08,166
I can understand this.

1914
02:07:08,291 --> 02:07:11,125
But, my parents won't take it lying down.

1915
02:07:11,250 --> 02:07:13,708
So it's better if you don't go to office 
from tomorrow.

1916
02:07:14,791 --> 02:07:16,541
When is our wedding, Ajay?

1917
02:07:18,041 --> 02:07:19,041
Tell me when it is.

1918
02:07:19,166 --> 02:07:20,208
This Friday at 9:30.

1919
02:07:20,333 --> 02:07:25,583
Which means that until 9:29 AM on Friday, 
I belong to this house.

1920
02:07:28,166 --> 02:07:31,375
After 9:30, you can ask me any question 
you desire.

1921
02:07:31,500 --> 02:07:32,583
I'll answer you.

1922
02:07:35,666 --> 02:07:37,916
My family is in a tough spot right now.

1923
02:07:38,041 --> 02:07:40,625
At this juncture, 
I have to support them.

1924
02:07:41,625 --> 02:07:44,833
It's alright if your parents 
cannot comprehend this.

1925
02:07:44,958 --> 02:07:46,625
You must explain it to them.

1926
02:07:50,708 --> 02:07:55,916
'Bonds that arise from friendship, 
end when partners separate.'

1927
02:07:56,041 --> 02:08:01,083
'Bonds that come from family, 
end not even when partners separate.'

1928
02:08:01,208 --> 02:08:03,958
'Nothing can change that relationship!'

1929
02:08:04,083 --> 02:08:09,208
'Only upon falling into a pit, 
will you know its depth, my dear!'

1930
02:08:09,333 --> 02:08:14,500
'Only when a heart breaks, 
will you know the depth of its misery!'

1931
02:08:14,625 --> 02:08:18,250
'You stood all over my heart.'

1932
02:08:18,375 --> 02:08:20,916
'You won over all my memories.'

1933
02:08:21,041 --> 02:08:24,208
'Leaving me behind, you walked away.'

1934
02:08:24,333 --> 02:08:28,958
'Vanishing not, 
you appeared before my eyes.'

1935
02:08:29,083 --> 02:08:31,583
'Within my eyes, you stayed.'

1936
02:08:31,708 --> 02:08:34,166
'Like a dream, you faded away.'

1937
02:08:35,500 --> 02:08:39,541
'Even if lost, 
the sky will not be gone.'

1938
02:08:40,666 --> 02:08:44,833
'In the same vein, 
our love will never change!'

1939
02:08:44,958 --> 02:08:50,333
'Even if you leave my side, 
our bond shall never break.'

1940
02:08:50,458 --> 02:08:55,625
'Even if I die, 
our love shall never change.'

1941
02:08:55,750 --> 02:09:00,958
'No matter what the heart says, 
it will not forget you.'

1942
02:09:01,083 --> 02:09:05,583
'Wounds may heal, 
but scars remain forever.'

1943
02:09:40,875 --> 02:09:42,625
It's almost done.

1944
02:09:46,708 --> 02:09:47,750
Dig in.

1945
02:09:47,875 --> 02:09:50,166
Today is Saturday.

1946
02:09:56,208 --> 02:09:57,208
Now eat.

1947
02:10:08,291 --> 02:10:11,333
Remember I told you that if I came first 
I'd tell you something?

1948
02:10:11,458 --> 02:10:14,083
If this project is successful, 
I'll tell you.

1949
02:10:51,583 --> 02:10:52,958
We got it!

1950
02:11:19,458 --> 02:11:21,500
Before we booze, 
I wanted to address you all.

1951
02:11:21,625 --> 02:11:24,791
Because if I speak after boozing, 
you'd think I was blubbering!

1952
02:11:27,041 --> 02:11:29,416
I lost. 
Yes, I lost.

1953
02:11:30,375 --> 02:11:33,541
I never wanted to seek Mahalakshmi's help 
in my life.

1954
02:11:33,666 --> 02:11:36,583
But, if she has helped me, 
it means I've lost, right?

1955
02:11:41,458 --> 02:11:44,458
If it wasn't for her, 
we wouldn't be celebrating this!

1956
02:11:44,583 --> 02:11:46,166
That's why I'm saying that I lost.

1957
02:11:47,541 --> 02:11:50,958
For the first time, 
I'm glad that I lost.

1958
02:11:51,083 --> 02:11:52,958
As only because I lost, 
did I win today.

1959
02:11:59,125 --> 02:12:02,541
In college, I told Mahalakshmi that 
I'd tell her something if I came first.

1960
02:12:03,750 --> 02:12:05,541
Until now, I haven't told her that.

1961
02:12:06,500 --> 02:12:09,625
In this happy occasion, 
I wish to tell her that before all of you.

1962
02:12:27,958 --> 02:12:29,083
Awesome, sis!

1963
02:12:29,208 --> 02:12:31,083
Just as you promised...

1964
02:12:31,208 --> 02:12:33,208
...you made Balu say 
"That is Mahalakshmi!"

1965
02:12:33,333 --> 02:12:34,916
So, you're the winner!

1966
02:12:35,041 --> 02:12:38,291
Yes, sis! 
You're the winner!

1967
02:12:43,958 --> 02:12:46,125
You're here, huh? 
You left halfway!

1968
02:12:47,833 --> 02:12:50,333
Did you hear what I said?

1969
02:12:57,166 --> 02:12:59,250
That's what you wanted me to say, right?

1970
02:13:00,291 --> 02:13:02,666
Did it startle you when I said that?

1971
02:13:02,791 --> 02:13:04,625
I knew it would shock you!

1972
02:13:06,083 --> 02:13:08,083
You're happy now, right?

1973
02:13:08,208 --> 02:13:09,458
Yes, I'm happy.

1974
02:13:09,583 --> 02:13:11,416
I'm really really happy!

1975
02:13:11,541 --> 02:13:15,208
With this project, my company made a profit 
of more than 80 crore rupees!

1976
02:13:15,333 --> 02:13:16,875
What is 80 crores, anyway?

1977
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,750
In six months, 
you'll topple Ajay's company.

1978
02:13:23,125 --> 02:13:24,708
I need to overtake Ajay's company.

1979
02:13:30,125 --> 02:13:32,666
That means I haven't surpassed 
Ajay's company, right?

1980
02:13:32,791 --> 02:13:35,750
Not at all... 
-Ajay's company is very huge!

1981
02:13:35,875 --> 02:13:38,291
My company is really small, 
am I right?

1982
02:13:39,583 --> 02:13:41,875
In your eyes, 
Ajay is always great.

1983
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:43,000
But I'm not, right?

1984
02:13:43,125 --> 02:13:44,875
I didn't mean to say that.

1985
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:47,250
I'm nothing to you, right?

1986
02:13:49,125 --> 02:13:51,541
Not even this level of great to you, am I?

1987
02:13:54,750 --> 02:13:57,916
Remember how you looked at me 
when you first came from your village?

1988
02:13:58,041 --> 02:13:59,541
With a look of surprise.

1989
02:13:59,666 --> 02:14:01,458
I seemed spectacular in your eyes, yes?

1990
02:14:01,583 --> 02:14:04,291
I was like the sky for you, right?

1991
02:14:04,416 --> 02:14:07,041
I always wanted to see those feelings 
in your eyes.

1992
02:14:07,166 --> 02:14:09,958
I always wanted to appear great to you.

1993
02:14:10,083 --> 02:14:13,750
You know why I stopped you 
when you wanted to leave after failing?

1994
02:14:13,875 --> 02:14:15,875
Because, I didn't want to lose you.

1995
02:14:17,375 --> 02:14:19,750
To my misfortune, 
Ajay became the topper.

1996
02:14:21,708 --> 02:14:24,541
So that only I would seem great to you 
again.

1997
02:14:24,666 --> 02:14:26,833
To see that surprised look in your eyes 
again.

1998
02:14:26,958 --> 02:14:28,208
But, what did you say?

1999
02:14:28,333 --> 02:14:31,250
"Ajay is great!" 
All was lost!

2000
02:14:31,375 --> 02:14:32,875
Everything was lost!

2001
02:14:33,291 --> 02:14:34,291
It really hurts.

2002
02:14:35,333 --> 02:14:38,500
Wonder why it hurts me 
if you call someone else great?

2003
02:14:39,625 --> 02:14:42,208
I seem like a jealous oaf to you, right?

2004
02:14:42,333 --> 02:14:44,208
I seem like a lunatic, right?

2005
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:49,750
Because, I wanted the girl who loved me 
to only think of me as great.

2006
02:14:52,166 --> 02:14:54,375
Yes, Mahalakshmi. 
I love you.

2007
02:14:56,166 --> 02:14:58,583
You are my heart. 
My life!

2008
02:14:58,708 --> 02:15:01,041
I like you so very much, Mahalakshmi.

2009
02:15:03,375 --> 02:15:06,708
My aunt's daughter, right? 
Thought you wouldn't go anywhere.

2010
02:15:06,833 --> 02:15:08,458
But... you left.

2011
02:15:11,375 --> 02:15:13,041
I waited for you for three years.

2012
02:15:13,916 --> 02:15:16,708
Know what I thought 
when you came to the hospital that day?

2013
02:15:16,833 --> 02:15:19,166
Why our grandma didn't have 
a heart attack earlier!

2014
02:15:20,166 --> 02:15:22,000
When uncle Rami 
asked about our wedding...

2015
02:15:22,125 --> 02:15:26,083
...fearing that you'd reject me, 
I lied about having a girlfriend.

2016
02:15:27,708 --> 02:15:29,500
That's why I brought Swapna home.

2017
02:15:30,625 --> 02:15:32,458
Do you know who Swapna is?

2018
02:15:34,333 --> 02:15:35,750
She is my personal assistant!

2019
02:15:36,208 --> 02:15:38,791
Thought you'd get jealous 
if I brought Swapna home.

2020
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,125
But lo and behold, 
came the one named Ajay!

2021
02:15:43,833 --> 02:15:46,041
After making you say 
that I was great...

2022
02:15:46,166 --> 02:15:48,000
...I wanted to tell you 
that I loved you.

2023
02:15:48,333 --> 02:15:50,375
But every time, I keep losing!

2024
02:15:51,625 --> 02:15:53,041
I'm not great, Mahalakshmi.

2025
02:15:54,291 --> 02:15:55,291
I'm just plain Balu.

2026
02:15:59,083 --> 02:16:00,291
That's all.

2027
02:16:00,416 --> 02:16:03,208
You are my success and my failure. 
You are my everything!

2028
02:16:03,333 --> 02:16:05,083
If not for you, I am not me.

2029
02:16:05,208 --> 02:16:06,833
Now, you're no longer for me.

2030
02:16:09,041 --> 02:16:12,708
I love you!

2031
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:21,375
No need, Mahalakshmi.

2032
02:16:21,500 --> 02:16:25,625
Like buying someone's first rank for me, 
don't give up your love for my sake.

2033
02:16:35,458 --> 02:16:36,625
There you have it!

2034
02:16:36,750 --> 02:16:40,166
My great love failure story!

2035
02:16:40,291 --> 02:16:44,208
What is this? 
She's been madly in love with you!

2036
02:16:44,333 --> 02:16:47,208
Yes! Yes, indeed!

2037
02:16:47,333 --> 02:16:50,416
Is that how you all felt? 
-Yes!

2038
02:16:50,541 --> 02:16:52,791
That's how we felt! 
-It's nothing like that!

2039
02:16:52,916 --> 02:16:54,541
Mahalakshmi never loved me.

2040
02:16:54,666 --> 02:16:59,875
As I told the story from my perspective, 
I embellished certain nuggets.

2041
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:01,791
That's all it was! 
Nothing else!

2042
02:17:01,916 --> 02:17:06,125
If Mahalakshmi didn't love you, 
why did she have to tell you that she did?

2043
02:17:06,250 --> 02:17:09,583
Fair question, bro! At least in the end, 
you asked the right question.

2044
02:17:10,916 --> 02:17:12,958
She said it because I told her I loved her!

2045
02:17:13,083 --> 02:17:15,000
What if I didn't tell her I loved her?

2046
02:17:19,083 --> 02:17:21,500
That's it! 
All is lost!

2047
02:17:21,625 --> 02:17:24,791
If she didn't love you, why would she 
help out at your company?

2048
02:17:24,916 --> 02:17:27,166
It is a family company, boss!

2049
02:17:27,291 --> 02:17:30,791
True. She helped because she didn't want 
her family's company to suffer.

2050
02:17:30,916 --> 02:17:32,708
Isn't that right, bro? 
-Indeed!

2051
02:17:32,833 --> 02:17:34,291
Now tell me, boss!

2052
02:17:34,416 --> 02:17:37,666
Would you believe Mahalakshmi 
when she says that she loves me?

2053
02:17:37,791 --> 02:17:41,458
Doesn't seem believable... 
-Seem drunk and confused...

2054
02:17:42,916 --> 02:17:46,833
I've put my ego aside 
and told you my entire story!

2055
02:17:46,958 --> 02:17:48,375
And you won't believe me, huh?

2056
02:17:49,166 --> 02:17:51,083
I swear, boss!

2057
02:17:51,208 --> 02:17:56,666
I was the one who sincerely loved her. 
She didn't love me at all! Believe me!

2058
02:17:56,791 --> 02:17:59,375
We believe you, bro!

2059
02:17:59,500 --> 02:18:00,625
I won't believe you!

2060
02:18:00,750 --> 02:18:02,208
Someone won't believe me!

2061
02:18:02,333 --> 02:18:03,875
Who's there?

2062
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,208
Who is that? 
-Some old man...

2063
02:18:06,333 --> 02:18:07,750
Grandpa? 
-Grandpa?

2064
02:18:08,625 --> 02:18:09,708
Grandpa!

2065
02:18:15,250 --> 02:18:16,958
Quiet! 
-Hey, Quiet!

2066
02:18:17,083 --> 02:18:18,083
Grandpa!

2067
02:18:19,041 --> 02:18:20,458
Welcome, dad! 
-Hello, uncle!

2068
02:18:21,333 --> 02:18:22,875
What is this? 
-Have a seat.

2069
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:25,958
What is going on here? 
-The wedding of Balu and Mahalakshmi, dad.

2070
02:18:26,083 --> 02:18:28,083
The wedding is not between them!

2071
02:18:28,208 --> 02:18:30,166
One wedding for him 
and another for her!

2072
02:18:31,333 --> 02:18:33,083
I never wanted to come here!

2073
02:18:33,208 --> 02:18:36,875
You deceived me by deliberately misreading 
the wedding invitation!

2074
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:38,875
Only upon coming here 
did I know the truth!

2075
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,916
They didn't deceive me. 
They've been deceiving each other!

2076
02:18:42,041 --> 02:18:43,041
Dad, I... 
-Hey!

2077
02:18:44,041 --> 02:18:47,375
Don't you know that Balu and Mahalakshmi 
love each other?

2078
02:18:48,750 --> 02:18:50,666
They don't even have time to quarrel, dad!

2079
02:18:53,916 --> 02:18:56,416
Do you love Mahalakshmi or not?

2080
02:18:56,541 --> 02:18:57,750
Balu does love her.

2081
02:18:58,750 --> 02:19:00,416
But, Mahalakshmi doesn't love him.

2082
02:19:02,916 --> 02:19:04,833
Do you love Balu or not?

2083
02:19:04,958 --> 02:19:07,666
He's lying! 
I've told him so many times!

2084
02:19:07,791 --> 02:19:09,625
He doesn't believe in my love, grandpa!

2085
02:19:11,541 --> 02:19:14,250
She says she loves you, right? 
So what's the problem?

2086
02:19:14,375 --> 02:19:16,458
She'll say that 
if you ask her before everyone!

2087
02:19:16,583 --> 02:19:19,125
You don't have to throw alms of love to me.

2088
02:19:19,250 --> 02:19:20,708
Ajay is great. 
Go marry him!

2089
02:19:20,833 --> 02:19:23,416
Who is Ajay? 
-See how he talks, grandpa?

2090
02:19:23,541 --> 02:19:26,833
If I call Sachin Tendulkar great, 
does it mean that I love him?

2091
02:19:26,958 --> 02:19:29,791
See that? 
Now she compares Ajay to Tendulkar!

2092
02:19:29,916 --> 02:19:32,291
That means he plays well 
and I'm a street player, yes?

2093
02:19:32,416 --> 02:19:34,333
Stop pissing me off! 
I'm getting very angry!

2094
02:19:34,458 --> 02:19:36,500
Yes! 
All you will ever feel for me is anger!

2095
02:19:36,625 --> 02:19:39,041
Because you didn't love me, right? 
Just infatuation!

2096
02:19:39,166 --> 02:19:40,250
Infatuation, huh?

2097
02:19:40,375 --> 02:19:41,791
What is this? 
-Let go, grandpa!

2098
02:19:42,500 --> 02:19:46,916
What I had for you is just infatuation, eh? 
How can you claim that my love is that?

2099
02:19:48,458 --> 02:19:50,291
Do you know the depth of my feelings?

2100
02:19:50,416 --> 02:19:52,833
Your one caress 
made my life entire shiver.

2101
02:19:52,958 --> 02:19:55,625
Even now, I want to hug you tightly!

2102
02:19:56,916 --> 02:19:59,083
It's so hard to stand so apart from you!

2103
02:20:00,541 --> 02:20:01,875
What the hell, man!

2104
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:05,750
How else can a girl give up her inhibition 
and admit that she loves you?

2105
02:20:05,875 --> 02:20:07,541
Can't you even understand that? Fool!

2106
02:20:07,666 --> 02:20:09,708
Is that so? 
Then have her answer this!

2107
02:20:09,833 --> 02:20:12,666
If she loved me, 
why did she have to love Ajay, too?

2108
02:20:12,791 --> 02:20:14,458
Have her answer that! 
Tell me!

2109
02:20:14,583 --> 02:20:16,333
Think I loved Ajay? 
-Yes!

2110
02:20:16,625 --> 02:20:18,750
For three years, Ajay proposed to me!

2111
02:20:18,875 --> 02:20:20,250
But, I didn't accept it at all.

2112
02:20:20,375 --> 02:20:23,000
Only after you brought Swapna, 
did I accept his proposal.

2113
02:20:23,125 --> 02:20:25,875
Good grief! Don't believe her, grandpa! 
She's like grandma!

2114
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,833
Even if you agree to it, 
I won't agree to our marriage!

2115
02:20:28,958 --> 02:20:30,208
Is that so? 
Very well!

2116
02:20:30,333 --> 02:20:32,541
Get Swapna out here! 
Swapna, let's get married!

2117
02:20:34,166 --> 02:20:35,208
What is this, dear?

2118
02:20:35,333 --> 02:20:37,541
Getting violent before everyone? 
Not nice.

2119
02:20:39,041 --> 02:20:43,041
Watching you two reminds me of the mistake 
made by your grandma and me 30 years ago!

2120
02:20:44,250 --> 02:20:48,583
This stubbornness. 
This is what made us to part ways!

2121
02:20:49,583 --> 02:20:50,583
And now, you two...

2122
02:21:20,125 --> 02:21:25,458
Please take us as an example, 
throw away the ego from your hearts...

2123
02:21:25,583 --> 02:21:26,750
...and be happy.

2124
02:21:26,875 --> 02:21:28,750
Alright, grandpa. 
I'll do as you say.

2125
02:21:28,875 --> 02:21:30,500
Under one condition. 
-What is that?

2126
02:21:30,625 --> 02:21:33,750
Just once, let her say that 
Ajay isn't great, but I am.

2127
02:21:35,375 --> 02:21:37,458
No, grandpa. 
I can't say that.

2128
02:21:37,583 --> 02:21:40,291
If my love is true 
only if I say that Balu is great...

2129
02:21:40,416 --> 02:21:42,750
...all my years of loving him 
will be meaningless!

2130
02:21:50,916 --> 02:21:52,833
Back in my hometown, 
you said he was great!

2131
02:21:52,958 --> 02:21:54,875
That was my dear Kajol, grandpa!

2132
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,958
I meant that my lover Sharukh 
was great, grandpa.

2133
02:21:58,083 --> 02:22:01,041
Good grief! 
Who is this Sharukh and Kajol?

2134
02:22:05,833 --> 02:22:09,125
I am the great creator of these characters. 
Robert Ramaiah!

2135
02:22:10,416 --> 02:22:11,750
Turn this way, my boy.

2136
02:22:11,875 --> 02:22:12,875
Yes, uncle?

2137
02:22:14,041 --> 02:22:16,875
What is this? 
Slapping me as if I were a schoolboy?

2138
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:20,541
Why not? As if these characters 
weren't enough, you create new ones?

2139
02:22:20,666 --> 02:22:23,333
Why? Are my creations 
causing any problems?

2140
02:22:23,458 --> 02:22:25,500
They're not causing any problems.

2141
02:22:25,625 --> 02:22:27,666
They've given a solution to the problem.

2142
02:22:30,041 --> 02:22:32,708
Even if my car is gone, 
my concept worked out!

2143
02:22:34,916 --> 02:22:37,541
This guy's glaring at me, too! 
Not letting me bask in joy!

2144
02:22:39,208 --> 02:22:41,041
Do you like Kajol?

2145
02:22:41,166 --> 02:22:42,500
I like her a lot, grandpa!

2146
02:22:42,625 --> 02:22:44,291
Kajol has neither a flashback...

2147
02:22:45,666 --> 02:22:46,666
...nor an Ajay!

2148
02:22:48,333 --> 02:22:51,166
Do you really like Sharukh?

2149
02:22:51,291 --> 02:22:52,416
I like him very much!

2150
02:22:52,541 --> 02:22:54,458
He will do anything for me!

2151
02:22:54,583 --> 02:22:56,000
He'll even give his life for me!

2152
02:22:57,125 --> 02:23:00,500
What are you waiting for? 
Change that name board at the entrance!

2153
02:23:10,375 --> 02:23:12,625
Grandpa! 
She looks just like Mahalakshmi!

2154
02:23:15,083 --> 02:23:16,250
Who are you?

2155
02:23:16,375 --> 02:23:17,500
I'm Sharukh, grandpa!

2156
02:23:17,625 --> 02:23:19,625
If you're Sharukh, 
she's Kajol, right?

2157
02:23:19,750 --> 02:23:20,833
Tie the nuptial thread!

2158
02:23:34,875 --> 02:23:37,041
What? 
-I'm not Kajol. I'm Mahalakshmi!

2159
02:23:38,208 --> 02:23:39,625
Grandpa! 
-What?

2160
02:23:39,750 --> 02:23:41,166
She's Mahalakshmi!

2161
02:23:50,458 --> 02:23:51,625
Deceived me, didn't you?

2162
02:23:53,333 --> 02:23:54,291
Be well!

2163
02:23:57,791 --> 02:23:58,875
I'll take two!

2164
02:24:00,875 --> 02:24:03,541
You're diabetic, right? 
Don't take it!

2165
02:24:03,666 --> 02:24:05,125
What a silly guy you are!

2166
02:24:05,250 --> 02:24:07,625
Take some! 
-Eat. A walk tomorrow should make it fine.

2167
02:24:07,750 --> 02:24:09,166
Take some, baby doll!

2168
02:24:10,333 --> 02:24:12,125
Take some, 'Look-Man'!

2169
02:24:12,250 --> 02:24:14,041
What is this for? 
For their wedding?

2170
02:24:14,166 --> 02:24:17,083
No! 
I've bought a new white colored Benz car!

2171
02:24:22,083 --> 02:24:23,833
For your honeymoon! Enjoy! 
-Thanks!

2172
02:24:23,958 --> 02:24:25,541
Not again!
