00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:55,195
Stop the cart, man.

2
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:17,690
Such a wonderful painting has
fallen here lonely. Right?

3
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,592
How did it come here?

4
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,219
Who has dropped it here?

5
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:25,096
lfthey had known its value,theywould
havenotthrown this here.

6
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,370
lt's justa painting of
a girl. That's all.

7
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,338
You'repraisingthis
greatly. Why?.

8
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:37,542
Artists like me onlyknow the
valueofthis painting.

9
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:42,181
What? ls this painting
apriceless painting?

10
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:44,984

country peoplepay forit.

11
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:49,389
But other country people
will givelakhs for it.

12
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:57,997
Because it is a painting of agreat painter
in king's period before 100's of years.

13
00:04:57,997 --> 00:05:03,436
Dear! We are suffering from povertyhere.
That God has shown us agood way to earn.

14
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:07,707
Keep this in an exhibition
now itself & earn money.

15
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:11,477
A real artistlikeme,
can't do likethat.

16
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:14,480
When was l happy after
marrying you?

17
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:20,486

jewels and all.

23
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:38,171
Selling an art for an artist is
like committing suicidehimself.

Anaconda serpent, which acted in
English picture was caught byme only.

107
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:21,874
Ask Hollywood about

00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,328
When? -5 years ago...

169
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:55,374
That house problems got
solved 5 years before...!

170
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,576
When that painting
has come here...

171
00:22:57,576 --> 00:23:00,204
Problems have got started
in your house.

172
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:03,849
Where is your daughter
Aliyanow?

173
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:05,250

174
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:11,823
My daughterAliyahas left

this painting as her prize.

176
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:24,736
lf she had died after getting
this painting as her prize...

177
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:27,466
This girl is the cause forthat.

178
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:29,806
This Nagavalli only.

179
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:34,179

Who is this Nagavalli? Whywill our family
getproblems becauseofher?

182
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:48,226
ln which family shestays, a girl in that
family will become hertarget.

183
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:53,220
She won't leavethat target girl until
shereaches someother person.

lfso,why should
we lock theroom?

185

Why don't we throw
thepainting outside?

186
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:04,276

outside, it will go out.

house has become her target or not.

How can you find it, priest?

00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:16,655

l've never seen a person
like you until now.

336
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:52,542
Do you know anything
aboutme?

337
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:57,321
You won't design only dresses.

338
00:35:57,321 --> 00:36:01,223
lfyou see any good painting,

339
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:09,162
What, Doctor? You've known very
well about our family members.

340
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:14,703
Just for fun...!

341
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,039
Oneperson is missing
in your family.

342
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:23,781
Dear! Does heknow about
our elder daughter also?

343
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:27,114
Keep quiet. You don't make him
to know that blabbering it yourself.

344
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:30,888
lt's 2 days sincel came

345
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:33,391

You've comenow only,
haven't you?

347
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:38,095
But you'retelling about everybody
so perfectly, aren't you?

348
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:39,330
How is that?

349
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:44,669
Priest! Some people will get information about
everybody after comingto theirhome.

350
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:48,406
l've comehere only after getting all the
information about everybodyhere.

351
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:50,306
That's me.

352
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:55,846
Thieves onlywill cometo ahousegetting

how you imagined.

355
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:05,489
You gave Rs.50000 bill for
your own brother-in-law.

356
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:07,425
You cleared Rs.1000 in that.

357
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:10,792
You swallowedthe
balance Rs.49000.

358
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:19,799
ls this enough? Or... Should you tell your cash
balancein your Vijayabank account?

359
00:37:21,138 --> 00:37:23,941
He is very dangerous.

360
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:26,143
l haveto chaseout him
from thehousefirst.

361
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:27,872
Thatalone is not possible.

362
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:32,049
Heis telling
my mind voiceexactly.

363
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:35,041
Heis a peculiar person, who can
hear many secret matters.

364
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:37,419
That's it.

365
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,853
Priest! Whereis our party?

366
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:45,552

369
00:37:58,676 --> 00:37:59,370
Whata sound is this?

370
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,004
Where did everybody go?

371
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:08,277
Sinners have goneleaving me

372
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:18,890
Come to enjoywith me. -Oh no!
l'm hearing an ankletsound.

373
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:22,261
Why are you watching the door
standing hereas group?

374
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:29,097
Hai Nagavalli!

375
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:39,050
Okay. Why did they
lock this room?

376
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:41,118
l only askedthem to
lock this room.

377
00:38:41,118 --> 00:38:43,487
ls that you? Why, priest?

378
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:46,724
To find the one,who has
become hertarget...!

379
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:48,292
How can we find that if
you lock this door?

380
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:50,453
Wecan find it only if
the door is opened. Right?

381
00:38:53,864 --> 00:38:56,667
He's closedthedoor & asked
them to lock it unnecessarily.

382
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,937
l can understand your
anxietynow only.

383
00:38:59,937 --> 00:39:02,740
You're wishing to
draw this painting.

384
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,368
Butpriest didn'tgive you
that opportunity. Correct...?

385
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,050
Don't get excited.

386
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:15,453
Nobody will obstruct
you hereafter.

387
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:17,819
You draw her freely.

388
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:22,917
What are you doing? Letmebless
you as yourwish should cometrue.

389
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:41,312
What? -l'vecome.
l'veseen it.

390
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:46,851

391
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:51,088
Do you likethat girl? -Oh no.
Whether l like her ornot.

392
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:53,324
lt's enough if she
doesn't likeme.

393
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:56,093
You aretheonly bachelor
in this house.

394
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:58,829
Why do you saythese things in front
ofher photo? lf shehears this...?

395
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:01,195
Just for fun...!

396
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:04,535
Doctor's voice has
got shifted to me.

397
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:05,524
Oh God!

398
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:32,496
l'm keep on changing my
pampers by getting scared.

399
00:40:32,496 --> 00:40:38,059
Are you sleeping snoring like
atractor covering your body fully?

400
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:47,611
Are you sleeping? -Are you asking
a sleeping person abouthis sleep, fool?

401
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:50,848
lt's 12 P.M now. Did you hear
theclock sound 12 times?

402
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:54,151
Can the clock ring 18
times for 12 o 'clock?

403
00:40:54,151 --> 00:40:55,880
Sleep off calmly without
torturing me.

404
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:00,591
l have a small doubt.

405
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:03,327
What? -Can l get married?

406
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:04,361
You'll get married definitely.

407
00:41:04,361 --> 00:41:06,030
l have that belief.

408
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:08,499
Children...? -You'd have
thatbelief.

409
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:10,334
Oh! How can l get
that belief?.

410
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:14,238
lfl seethis housesituation, there is
no guarantee for my life also.

411
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:18,075
How can l getmarried & get
children ifl am notalive?

412
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:19,109
Whythat much?

413
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:25,105
lfl see my beautiful face in that mirror,
it looks like a Dracula, doctor.

414
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:31,322
Hey! A coward like you challenged
a braveboylike me.

415
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,356
As what...?

416
00:41:32,356 --> 00:41:36,060
He askedwhether l can go to aburial ground
& keep afloweron a cemetery or not.

417
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:39,497
ls itnot enough if you keep flower on his ears?
Should you keep in cemetery only?

418
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,198
Hear thestory first.

419
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:42,266
Tell me, doctor.

420
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:47,204
Hehad gonethere. While he keptthe
flower & turned, someonepulled his shirt.

421
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:48,873
Then, ghost must behere.

422
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:53,708
No, dear. ln fear,
he inserted his shirt also in that.

423
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:58,270
Ghosts arethereifpeoplebelieve it.
lt's not thereifpeople don't believeit.

424
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:01,919
ls there ghost or not now?

425
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:04,911
You remove your bed sheet
& tell me confirmed.

426
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:10,294
Who has directedthe
storyto meuntil now?

427
00:42:10,294 --> 00:42:12,096
Nobody is here.

428
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:16,032
Did you go leaving me
alonehere, doctor?

429
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,370
Why are you shouting, man?

430
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:24,909
Why do you threaten me arranging this
pillow here & lying underthe cot?

431
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:25,943
Whymeans...?

432
00:42:25,943 --> 00:42:29,713
lf Nagavalli comes atnight and
tries to crush my neck...?

433
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:30,748
l'veput this plan
forthat only.

434
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:33,350
lf shedoesn't get you...?
-You'rehere, aren't you?

435
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:35,252
Should l die....? -Shut up!

436
00:42:35,252 --> 00:42:38,322
You toldthatthereis no ghost in your
story. Are you tellingthis now?

437
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:41,392
l told likethat in my story.
But remember onething.

438
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:45,529
All others in this house
exceptus are ghosts only.

439
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:48,766
l can'tgetsleep in this
ghost bungalow, doctor.

440
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:49,733
You can't get sleep,
can you?

441
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:53,470
l'll give you atablet. You'll sleep well.
-Give me that dose, doctor.

00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:28,939
To give coffee to doctor...!

446
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:31,942
Did you go to give
coffee to doctor?

447
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:36,180

Go & mind your job.

He's made our family's girls as crazy in
one day as soon as hecamehere.

453
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:56,400
You told that you'd go
for bath only. Right?

454
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,061
Go. Go.

455
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:04,003

here from thedoctor.

456
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:41,941
ln that bungalow Nagavalli runs in
nighttimewearing anklet.

457
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:48,140
l can hearthe anklet sound in this
bungalow in thedaytime itself.

458
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:51,317
Something is taking placehere.

Open thedoor.

467
00:45:34,665 --> 00:45:35,999
Why are you shouting
like this, dad? Oh no.

468
00:45:35,999 --> 00:45:38,302
What elsecan l do instead

469
00:45:38,302 --> 00:45:40,998
You're therein bathroom.
Doctor is also there with you.

470
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:43,774

00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:46,276
Hey! Why did you lock

00:45:46,276 --> 00:45:49,947
Hema! All of you come fast.

473
00:45:49,947 --> 00:45:51,215
Come. -Why, man?

474
00:45:51,215 --> 00:45:53,550
What happened? Why are
you shouting louder?

475
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:55,219
lf Hemais taking bath here...

476
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:58,122
What's thework of doctor
in her bathroom?

477
00:45:58,122 --> 00:46:02,259
He is not good. Send him out
from thehousefirst.

478
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:05,629
Hema! Come fast! Come out.

479
00:46:05,629 --> 00:46:09,395
Comeout. Hey doctor!

480
00:46:14,204 --> 00:46:17,941
Dad! You're tensed
as soon as seeing him.

481
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,841
lf you taketreatment
from him, it's good.

482
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:25,015
What's theconfusion there?

483
00:46:25,015 --> 00:46:27,785
Oh no. Hewas thereherenow.
How can he go there immediately?.

484
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:30,821
l thought he would tell
our mind voicealone.

485
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:33,390
He's learnt an art of shifting from aplaceto
another placein a fraction ofsecond.

486
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:35,159
Hey! These are very silly.

487
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:36,727
When my doctordidn't get
any ladynurse...

488
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:38,128
Hechanges meas
agirl for 2 days...

489
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:40,230
Hemademeto handle
all themalepatients.

490
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:42,766
Heis a talented guy,
who knows all the64 arts.

491
00:46:42,766 --> 00:46:44,757
Are you pushing me
for praising you?

492
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:48,531
You've wasted
mytime. Come.

493
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:58,615
l finished Nagavalli's chapter in my soulful
friend Ramesh's house5 years ago.

494
00:46:58,615 --> 00:46:59,673
Right, priest?

495
00:47:00,851 --> 00:47:03,420
How do you tell thatthesameproblems
aretherein this housealso?

496
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:06,056
You'vecured Ganga.

497
00:47:06,056 --> 00:47:10,527
But Nagavalli's room door
was opened at that time.

498
00:47:10,527 --> 00:47:18,202
l felt by my wisdom that Nagavalli went
outin a serpent image from that room.

499
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:22,005
Wheredid she go in
these5 years?

500
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:26,343
Why did she go? Such a perturbation is
therein mymind from that period.

501
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:30,747
Weneed not search the one,who got
affected byher in this house, then.

502
00:47:30,747 --> 00:47:34,484
lt's enough ifwesearch
that 30 feet serpent.

503
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:39,523
Note it. Psychiatrists like you
don't accept ourwords always.

504
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:42,259
Priest!Just forfun...!

505

Ganga went searching
Nagavalli in that house.

508
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:54,060
Nagavalli has come searching
somebodyin this house.

509
00:47:54,605 --> 00:47:58,475
Assume that Nagavalli has come
to this houseas you say.

510
00:47:58,475 --> 00:48:00,544
Why did shecome
to this house?

511
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:01,612
Why didn't she come

512

Doctor! lt's a cheating.

Are you telling methat
there is ghosthere?

522
00:48:48,158 --> 00:48:50,460
l don't tell this. Priest
onlytoldthis.

523
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,195
Ghost has comehere.

524
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:56,099
Hetold this to you only. Right? Why did you
tell methat without hiding it in you?

525

Will anybodyhidethe ghost?

Serpent! -That's not
a serpent. Belt.

529
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:20,791
That is also looking like
a serpent for me.

530
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:28,298
Srinath! lfyou stay in

You can't run offfrom here

00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:35,572
Shewill come to you only.

534
00:49:35,572 --> 00:49:40,277
Doctor reads my
mind voice exactly.

535
00:49:40,277 --> 00:49:43,113
lt's good ifl think in an international
language, which hedoesn't know.

536
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:46,016
l can't sleep here because
ofthat ghost.

537
00:49:46,016 --> 00:49:48,318
That's why l haveto go off
from here.-That's impossible.

538
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:50,650
Ghost will comebehind you & attack
you from your frontside.

Enough. You'reshowing
yourtalent silently.

640
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:48,133
Why are you becoming
violent silently?.

641
01:00:49,379 --> 01:00:50,778
Let me leave now.

642
01:00:57,253 --> 01:00:58,914
Why is there anklet sound?

643
01:01:01,124 --> 01:01:03,183

Who has goneinsidelocking
the door outside?

645

01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:45,862
Who is that?

647

Ask him.

651
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:48,691
My first daughter Saraswathi
is thereinside.

652
01:03:48,691 --> 01:03:51,360
You told that shepassed away
by an accident, when l asked you.

653
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:53,419
l liedto you on
that day, priest.

654
01:03:54,463 --> 01:03:58,267
While coming with theprize photo
after completingtheir dancecompetition...

659
01:04:15,785 --> 01:04:17,620
Why did you hide
this matter from me?

660
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:21,958
Why did you lie that your daughter
is dead, when sheis alive?

661
01:04:21,958 --> 01:04:27,453
My second daughter's marriage got
stopped as my elder daughter is a mad.

662
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:38,641
Bridegroom's people are refusing our alliance
after knowing my elder daughter is amad.

663
01:04:38,641 --> 01:04:46,082
That's why, our Geetha has
refused her marriageclearly.

664
01:04:46,082 --> 01:04:51,721
As mythird daughterGowry also
should not get this situation...!

665
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:55,224
We'vehidden thematter
as Saraswathi is alive.

668
01:05:06,202 --> 01:05:07,897
Yes. lt's she only.

669
01:05:08,504 --> 01:05:12,541
Shedidn't forget dancing alone
even ifshehad turned as a mad.

670
01:05:12,541 --> 01:05:16,545
Shedances & sings
accordingto herwish.

671
01:05:16,545 --> 01:05:21,617
Shewears eyetex in her eyes fully.
Shewears saffron in her forehead fully.

672
01:05:21,617 --> 01:05:25,576
Shesmiles, cries,
shouts and fears.

673
01:05:26,322 --> 01:05:29,525
What do you think about
their daughteras a doctor?

674
01:05:29,525 --> 01:05:35,555
She is looking likea mad according
to vision. -She's nota mad definitely, then.

675
01:05:37,133 --> 01:05:39,035
How can you say
so confidently?

676
01:05:39,035 --> 01:05:44,905
lfshehad becomea mad really, she'd
have got cured by doctor's treatment.

677
01:05:45,474 --> 01:05:52,148
Nagavalli got mingled in Saraswathi's
body & killed her hubby.

678
01:05:52,148 --> 01:05:56,919
Shedoesn't accept anybody else
as herhusband except Ramanathan.

679
01:05:56,919 --> 01:05:59,021
You know that yourself,
don't you?

680
01:05:59,021 --> 01:06:01,854
Your opinion is wrong, priest.

681
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:06,162
Bring your daughterto
templeby tomorrow morning.

682
01:06:06,162 --> 01:06:09,928
l'll provethat Nagavalli is
there in her body.

683
01:06:32,788 --> 01:06:34,415
Why are you doing so?

684
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:14,163
Did you note it? As Nagavalli is
there in Saraswathi's body only...

685
01:07:14,163 --> 01:07:18,701
Shecould not enterinto
thetemple & went back.

686
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:25,107
Did you seethoseanimals reactions
afterwhen shestamped the temple?

687
01:07:25,107 --> 01:07:29,806
Animals know verywell about
thearrival of an evil power.

688
01:07:33,249 --> 01:07:34,773
lt maybe, priest.

689
01:07:35,484 --> 01:07:43,492
People saythatanimals know
about natural calamities in advance.

690
01:07:43,492 --> 01:07:47,229
ln case, atthetimewhen Saraswathi
stampedthetemplesteps...

691
01:07:47,229 --> 01:07:48,664
Earth quakemighthave
occurred somewhere.

692
01:07:48,664 --> 01:07:51,531
Animals & birds might have
reacted forthat only.

693
01:07:54,136 --> 01:07:59,904
Thesescientists will have aright opposite
question forwhateverwesay.

694
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:02,812
But remember onething.

695
01:08:02,812 --> 01:08:09,274
Sciencehas come from wisdom.
But wisdom hasn't come from science.

696
01:08:10,486 --> 01:08:16,225
lfl don't makeSaraswathi to sit
in thecenter ofmy Pooja...

697
01:08:16,225 --> 01:08:18,727
...& bring out Nagavalli's
voice from her...

698
01:08:18,727 --> 01:08:23,061
Mynameis not

699
01:09:07,209 --> 01:09:08,471
Priest!

...& get the truth about
her from her mouth.

706
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:07,896
She's done likethis.

707
01:10:09,805 --> 01:10:15,010
Can the girl, whom you suspect,
come out ofa locked room?

708
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:17,746
Nagavalli can change
to any visible form.

709
01:10:17,746 --> 01:10:24,320
When will she becomeagirl? Or...
When will shecomeoutas a serpent?

710
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:26,880
We can'ttell anything.

711
01:10:28,090 --> 01:10:31,260
As we should not
suspect that mad...!

712
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:33,128
She has madeherto
get escaped from us.

713
01:10:33,128 --> 01:10:41,331
Nagavalli triedthis attempt coming in some
other image locking herinto theroom.

714
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:46,075
Priest! Please don't
mistakeme.

Who is that?

877
01:33:17,525 --> 01:33:19,720
Vijaya Rajendra Bahadur.

878
01:33:19,860 --> 01:33:21,452
ls that you?

879
01:33:23,397 --> 01:33:27,390

No.

881
01:33:35,676 --> 01:33:37,007
No.

882
01:33:43,651 --> 01:33:44,777
Catch him.

883
01:33:52,026 --> 01:33:55,928
No. Don't kill meplease. No.

884
01:34:02,303 --> 01:34:08,542
When l had seen your facehappily last night,
l cameto know that he's comealive.

885
01:34:08,542 --> 01:34:14,448
l acted likegoing out to
trap you both together.

886
01:34:14,448 --> 01:34:19,886
How dare you areto enjoywith
him bringing him to my palace?

887
01:34:22,923 --> 01:34:25,084
Pour oil on her.

888
01:34:28,529 --> 01:34:31,794
Hey! Get me the firebrand.

889
01:34:34,101 --> 01:34:37,271
Fireme, man. Fireme.

890
01:34:37,271 --> 01:34:42,004
l'll revenge you definitelybyfiring
you & turning you into ash.

891
01:34:43,144 --> 01:34:45,476
l'll revenge you. You man!

892
01:35:16,277 --> 01:35:22,516
Fireme! l'll revenge you definitely by
firing you & turning you into ash.

893
01:35:22,516 --> 01:35:25,542
Hey! l'll revenge you. You man!

894
01:35:27,521 --> 01:35:29,590
When you raised a question &
weanalyzed this matter...

895
01:35:29,590 --> 01:35:35,129
Nagavalli has passed away. But her ghost
is roaming this palaceonlyuntil now.

896
01:35:35,129 --> 01:35:38,332
As her death has taken
placeon Dhurgashtami day...!

897
01:35:38,332 --> 01:35:43,504
We'd do a sacrificial fire Pooja on
Dhurgashtami day & lock her ghost here.

898
01:35:43,504 --> 01:35:46,632
This holylocking Poojais the
only solution forthis problem.

899
01:36:50,771 --> 01:36:51,572
Havethis door key.

900
01:36:51,572 --> 01:36:56,777
Look. You'd never open this door
lock after 100 years or 200 years.

901
01:36:56,777 --> 01:37:00,804
lfanybody opens this lock, her revenge
will get started again in some other form.

902
01:37:19,366 --> 01:37:20,534
Tell me, king.

903
01:37:20,534 --> 01:37:26,837
Even ifl had fired Nagavalli,
shedidn't go off from my heart.

904
01:37:30,845 --> 01:37:38,285
People! This Vijaya Rajendra Bahadur has
killed his own brotherwishing forthe throne.

905
01:37:38,285 --> 01:37:41,322
He murdered many kings wishing
forthe land properties.

906
01:37:41,322 --> 01:37:45,025
Hehas fired Nagavalli wishing for
alady's pleasure. Not onlythat.

907
01:37:45,025 --> 01:37:48,495
He's turned as an womanizer now and...!
-l don'tknow what you'll do.

908
01:37:48,495 --> 01:37:54,501
l need it. l need it now

01:37:55,636 --> 01:37:58,901
Your mother, sisters
and daughters!

911
01:37:59,773 --> 01:38:02,543
lfwedon't give him whatever
heasked us now...

912
01:38:02,543 --> 01:38:05,613
He will murder us & misbehave
with our family girls.

913
01:38:05,613 --> 01:38:09,116
So weshould not
leavehim alive.

914
01:38:09,116 --> 01:38:12,853
Why did you ask your men
to kidnap our city girls?

915
01:38:12,853 --> 01:38:15,656
Ourcity peoplehaveturned
back against you now.

916
01:38:15,656 --> 01:38:17,758

01:38:33,173 --> 01:38:35,573
Run off fast. Hurry
up! Trap him.

923
01:38:37,278 --> 01:38:40,681
Vijaya Rajendra Bahadur,who ran
getting escaped on that day...

924
01:38:40,681 --> 01:38:44,919
Some people told that he might
have committed suicide.

925
01:38:44,919 --> 01:38:48,422
Somepeoplebelieved that he
might havegot murdered.

926
01:38:48,422 --> 01:38:53,160
And somepeoplebelieved
thathewould be alive.

927
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:58,792
Which is true & which is falsein
these, arenot yetproved.

928
01:39:09,376 --> 01:39:10,866
Nagavalli!

929
01:39:11,912 --> 01:39:16,940
ln that case... Did she read
that book before me?

930
01:39:18,252 --> 01:39:20,487
l also know Kannada, man.

931
01:39:20,487 --> 01:39:24,758
Man! lt will bemorethan 100 years after
when Nagavalli's family peopledied.

932
01:39:24,758 --> 01:39:28,862
You're the second person,
who enquires abouttheir family.

933
01:39:28,862 --> 01:39:31,031
Who has come hereto enquire
about them before me?

934
01:39:31,031 --> 01:39:32,760
A girl...!

935
01:39:33,067 --> 01:39:34,368
ls that agirl?

936
01:39:34,368 --> 01:39:36,537
Shecame normally
in the beginning.

937
01:39:36,537 --> 01:39:39,239
Afterthat when shereturned
from that house...

938
01:39:39,239 --> 01:39:42,470
She ran offlike amad
with Nagavalli's photo.

939
01:39:43,477 --> 01:39:45,145
Another matter, sir.

940
01:39:45,145 --> 01:39:51,218
Peoplearetellingthat anklet sound is hearing
from that house from many years.

941
01:39:51,218 --> 01:39:55,589
The anklet sound has stopped after
when that girl visited here.

942
01:39:55,589 --> 01:39:58,183
Look. This is Nagavalli's house.

943
01:40:11,005 --> 01:40:18,207
l feltby mywisdom that Nagavalli has
goneoutin a serpent imageon that day.

944
01:40:27,388 --> 01:40:32,917
That outhouse Nagavalli's photo...
She brought that photo from here.

945
01:40:37,131 --> 01:40:40,100
That dancer died by a
lorry accident. lt's true.

946
01:40:40,100 --> 01:40:45,139
But he got rolled on the road
beforethelorry dashed him.

947
01:40:45,139 --> 01:40:48,939
lt's morethan 2 years since

948
01:40:51,678 --> 01:40:54,648
My snakecharmer got
aheart problem already.

01:40:54,648 --> 01:40:59,019
l warned him alreadynot to
blow thehautboy anymore.

950
01:40:59,019 --> 01:41:03,854
But hedied getting bleeding by
blowingthe hautboy for money.

951

Many sages & monks arealive in
Himalayas yet morethan 125 years also.

966
01:42:26,106 --> 01:42:29,269
They don't want to be visible

When my seniorcame to this house,

Whythat much? Who supplied continuous
power foryou peopleto play Kabadi?

Government people.
-No. That's also me.

chain to Geetha on that day, didn't you?

1159
02:05:24,083 --> 02:05:27,887
Nobody can harm meuntil
l have this power.

1160
02:05:27,887 --> 02:05:29,320
l remembered that.

1161
02:05:30,756 --> 02:05:33,919
l went to Geetha's room
suspecting her.

1162
02:05:39,498 --> 02:05:43,366
Great people are here. From
wheredid you bring these?

1163
02:05:44,270 --> 02:05:45,771
Are you making fun
ofme, doctor?

1164
02:05:45,771 --> 02:05:49,775
l didn't bring these paintings.
l've drawn thesemyself.

1165
02:05:49,775 --> 02:05:50,867
Did you draw these?

1166
02:05:52,478 --> 02:05:54,280
You'vedrawn wonderfully.

1167
02:05:54,280 --> 02:05:57,483
You'vedrawn them
so wonderfully...!

1168
02:05:57,483 --> 02:06:00,077
Why don't you draw
Nagavalli's painting?

1169
02:06:01,186 --> 02:06:02,721
l don'tknow what is
the reason behind it.

1170
02:06:02,721 --> 02:06:05,824
Whatever painting l see,
l will draw that in only day.

1171
02:06:05,824 --> 02:06:08,994
But l drew this painting
for manytimes.

1172
02:06:08,994 --> 02:06:10,829
Something is getting
missed in it.

1173
02:06:10,829 --> 02:06:12,898
lf eyes comenicely, nose
will become fault.

1174
02:06:12,898 --> 02:06:15,000
lfnosecomes well,
her hip becomes huge.

1175
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:18,504
Let me tell you. You know
about thesegreat people.

1176
02:06:18,504 --> 02:06:19,838
You'veseen
thesepeople.

1177
02:06:19,838 --> 02:06:21,307
That's why you've
drawn them so nicely.

1178
02:06:21,307 --> 02:06:23,075
Did you eversee Nagavalli?

1179
02:06:23,075 --> 02:06:24,743
Do you know about her?

1180
02:06:24,743 --> 02:06:27,179
Draw afterknowing about her.
Yourwish will cometrue.

1181
02:06:27,179 --> 02:06:28,781
Don'tl know her story?

1182
02:06:28,781 --> 02:06:30,749
A king kidnapped Nagavalli.

1183
02:06:30,749 --> 02:06:33,419
He knew that Nagavalli is meeting
her Ramanath secretly...!

1184
02:06:33,419 --> 02:06:34,920
He had removed
Ramanath's head.

1185
02:06:34,920 --> 02:06:36,945
Hefired heralso.

1186
02:06:38,958 --> 02:06:41,017
You'veknown manymatters.

1187
02:06:43,095 --> 02:06:46,999
Not only that. There's abook about
that Vijaya Rajendra Bahadur king.

1188
02:06:46,999 --> 02:06:50,202
What? ls therea book
about that king?

1189
02:06:50,202 --> 02:06:54,468
Yes. They wroteabouthim
& his characters also in that.

1190
02:06:55,341 --> 02:06:57,468
l wentto Library after
hearing Geetha's words.

1191
02:06:59,044 --> 02:07:01,647
l cameto know all the
matters about that king.

1192
02:07:01,647 --> 02:07:04,350
When l went to sign
in thatledger...

1193
02:07:04,350 --> 02:07:07,252
On whom l had a doubt
in this house...!

1194
02:07:07,252 --> 02:07:10,756
Her signaturewas there.
-Whoseis that?

1195
02:07:10,756 --> 02:07:12,348
Come. Let me show you.

1196
02:07:22,968 --> 02:07:24,629
How is your research
going on?

1197
02:07:25,838 --> 02:07:28,574
How many people did you
get beyond 90 years?

1198
02:07:28,574 --> 02:07:35,381
5 lakhs ofpeoplebeyond 100 years
aretherein this country. That's all.

1199
02:07:35,381 --> 02:07:37,249
l'vesurfed in internet.

1200
02:07:37,249 --> 02:07:42,084
Many sages beyond 125 years
arethere in Himalayas.

1201
02:07:42,888 --> 02:07:47,993
l knew that 1 or 2 peoplebeyond
125 years, are therein Karnataka.

1202
02:07:47,993 --> 02:07:53,599
l'll complete my research
after findingthem in 2 days.

1203
02:07:53,599 --> 02:07:58,370
l've found out aperson
among those 2 already.

1204
02:07:58,370 --> 02:08:03,842
ln this city.-No anyinformation about
him has come out until now.

1205
02:08:03,842 --> 02:08:06,045
Nobody had seen him.

1206
02:08:06,045 --> 02:08:07,513
l knew that.

1207
02:08:07,513 --> 02:08:11,083
Why didn't anybodyknow
abouthim forthesedays?

1208
02:08:11,083 --> 02:08:14,849
He's stayed in that cage
onlybefore40 years.

1209
02:08:15,988 --> 02:08:21,016
l'm the only person,who has come
out alive after seeing him.

1210
02:08:22,628 --> 02:08:25,756
What is his age? -123 years.

1211
02:08:26,932 --> 02:08:29,835
Did you seehim directlytruly?.

1212
02:08:29,835 --> 02:08:31,937
Not only seeing him.

1213
02:08:31,937 --> 02:08:34,106
l'veasked his namealso.

1214
02:08:34,106 --> 02:08:37,633
What's his name?
-Vijaya Rajendra Bahadur.

1215
02:08:42,748 --> 02:08:44,083
Whereis he now?

1216
02:08:44,083 --> 02:08:50,454
He's in a cage of Ratnagiri hill, which is
situated beyond 96 kilo meters from here.

1217
02:08:51,790 --> 02:08:55,828
He's therein his latelover's
thought only yet.

1218
02:08:55,828 --> 02:09:00,232
Hehas got a wish to get her in
another birth at least.

1219
02:09:00,232 --> 02:09:07,039
Pity! What does that crazyking know
about Nagavalli's real character?

1220
02:09:07,039 --> 02:09:09,942
What? Whatis there
for her character?

1221
02:09:09,942 --> 02:09:11,944
What do you know about her?

1222
02:09:11,944 --> 02:09:16,148
She got manylovers
except Ramanathan.

1223
02:09:16,148 --> 02:09:19,952
Shewas making everybody
happy at thesametime.

1224
02:09:19,952 --> 02:09:21,754
Not onlythat.

1225
02:09:21,754 --> 02:09:25,090
Sheneeded different
guys daily itseems.

1226
02:09:25,090 --> 02:09:29,628
King. Or minister. Warrior!
Or servant.

1227
02:09:29,628 --> 02:09:35,931
ln only word. Nagavalli is
alustful woman.

1228
02:09:38,137 --> 02:09:39,538
She's aprostitute.

1229
02:09:39,538 --> 02:09:41,836
Hey!

1230
02:09:54,520 --> 02:09:59,792
You dog! What do you
know about me, man?

1231
02:09:59,792 --> 02:10:05,856
l had never seen anybody else
except my Ramanathan, man.

1232
02:10:06,732 --> 02:10:11,370
Oh no.-lf you tell any
other story about meagain...

1235
02:10:17,509 --> 02:10:20,879
That Vijaya Rajendra Bahadur.

1236
02:10:20,879 --> 02:10:25,217
You don't get murdered by
mebefore him, man.

1237
02:10:25,217 --> 02:10:32,090
Hey! Who are you?
Gowry or Nagavalli...?

1238
02:10:32,090 --> 02:10:35,491
Tell me. Tell me.

1239
02:10:48,173 --> 02:10:52,473
What did l do?

1240
02:11:04,857 --> 02:11:08,293
No. l'm a sinner.

1241
02:11:08,293 --> 02:11:16,768
l've donea sin. Go! Go out.

1242
02:11:16,768 --> 02:11:19,605
Don't disturb me.

1243
02:11:19,605 --> 02:11:21,573

1244
02:11:26,812 --> 02:11:32,273
l don't want you.

1245
02:11:33,652 --> 02:11:37,486
Leaveme.

1246
02:11:43,428 --> 02:11:48,400
Please kill me. Pleasekill me.

1247
02:11:48,400 --> 02:11:52,632
lfl am alive, l will
murder somebody.

1248
02:12:14,726 --> 02:12:18,330
l don't know how
to praise you!

1249
02:12:18,330 --> 02:12:22,100
lf Gowry is the one,who got
affected by Nagavalli...

1250
02:12:22,100 --> 02:12:23,829
How did you find this truth?

1251
02:12:25,771 --> 02:12:32,611
When you shouted after seeing your burnt
things, all the family members cameout.

1252
02:12:32,611 --> 02:12:35,147
But Gowry didn't come out.

1253
02:12:35,147 --> 02:12:36,815
l notedthat.

1254
02:12:36,815 --> 02:12:43,055
On anight... l heard an anklet sound in my
soulful friend Ramesh's house. Right?

1255
02:12:43,055 --> 02:12:49,995
l heard thesameanklet sound from out
houselikesomeoneis dancing & singing.

1256
02:12:49,995 --> 02:12:51,596
l wentthere.

1257
02:12:51,596 --> 02:12:54,032
There was another
Nagavalli's photo.

1258
02:12:54,032 --> 02:12:57,269
One Nagavalli's photo came to this
house as a competition prize.

1259
02:12:57,269 --> 02:13:00,872
How did another Nagavalli's
photo comehere?

1260
02:13:00,872 --> 02:13:02,772
l gota doubt &
went inside.

1261
02:13:03,375 --> 02:13:05,844
Somebody threw
something on me.

1262
02:13:05,844 --> 02:13:08,613
l bent down to get escaped
from that attack.

1263
02:13:08,613 --> 02:13:12,584
Saraswathi,who was lying down
there shouted seeing me.

1264
02:13:12,584 --> 02:13:15,883
Somebodywas runningwearing
anklet in thesametime.

1265
02:13:17,556 --> 02:13:21,326
When l was thinking
how to find outthis...!

1266
02:13:21,326 --> 02:13:24,863
You asked them to bring
Saraswathi to thetemple.

1267
02:13:24,863 --> 02:13:27,599
Bring your daughter to the
templeby tomorrow morning.

1268
02:13:27,599 --> 02:13:31,003
l'll provethat Nagavalli is
there in her body.

1269
02:13:31,003 --> 02:13:35,207
All the familymembers brought
Saraswathi into the temple altogether.

1270
02:13:35,207 --> 02:13:42,409
But Gowry alone dragged out
Saraswathi from thetemplelonely.

1271
02:13:43,615 --> 02:13:46,118
l got shocked
seeing that incident.

1272
02:13:46,118 --> 02:13:49,855
l went to Gowry's room on that
night to check that matter.

1273
02:13:49,855 --> 02:13:52,257
Why are you tensed, doctor?

1274
02:13:52,257 --> 02:13:54,393
Won't l have anytension?

1275
02:13:54,393 --> 02:13:57,229
l also told manytimes to thepriest.

1276
02:13:57,229 --> 02:13:59,698
As Nagavalli is not there
in Saraswathi's body...!

1277
02:13:59,698 --> 02:14:01,800
He doesn't believe
mywords.

1278
02:14:01,800 --> 02:14:04,325
What do you think
about that, Doctor?

1279
02:14:05,303 --> 02:14:19,151
Aboutwhat? -Priest says that Nagavalli is
therein my sister's body.

1280
02:14:19,151 --> 02:14:23,722
l noted a sort of fear in
Gowry's voiceatthattime.

1281
02:14:23,722 --> 02:14:26,491
About that. -Oh! Aboutthat...?

1282
02:14:26,491 --> 02:14:30,985
l am telling confidently that your
sister is apsychological patient.

1283
02:14:32,731 --> 02:14:37,600
Nagavalli's problem is not there in this
houseaccording to my opinion.

1284
02:14:39,204 --> 02:14:43,575
Correct. l'veseen a sort of
vibration on Gowry's face.

1285
02:14:43,575 --> 02:14:45,644
Priesthas created an
unnecessary confusion...

1286
02:14:45,644 --> 02:14:49,214
...as Nagavalli's aggression
is therein this house.

1287
02:14:49,214 --> 02:14:50,916
Yourwords aretrue.

1288
02:14:50,916 --> 02:14:54,875
That Nagavalli's aggression is not there
in our house definitely, Doctor.

1289
02:14:57,222 --> 02:15:02,421
l had seen Saraswathi's classical
dress in Gowry's room on that day.

1290
02:15:03,895 --> 02:15:08,333
GowryworeSaraswathi's classical
dancedress & danced,

1291
02:15:08,333 --> 02:15:11,734
...when Saraswathi
was lying there.

1292
02:15:16,441 --> 02:15:20,679
You people thought that Saraswathi
only was dancing in out house.

1293
02:15:20,679 --> 02:15:23,748
But Gowry only was
dancingtheretruly.

1294
02:15:23,748 --> 02:15:26,751
As Gowryhas got
a research mind...!

1295
02:15:26,751 --> 02:15:30,755
Shewent to library & read all
thematters aboutthatking.

1296
02:15:30,755 --> 02:15:32,950
When l cameto this house
forthefirsttime...

1297
02:15:34,192 --> 02:15:38,029
l told herthat thereis no Nagavalli's
aggression in this houseknowingly.

1298
02:15:38,029 --> 02:15:41,829
That's why Nagavalli's concentration
didn'tturn towards me.

1299
02:15:42,968 --> 02:15:46,638
As you toldthat there is Nagavalli's aggression
is therein this house...! That's why...

1300
02:15:46,638 --> 02:15:50,909
Murder attempt took place
on you for 2 times...!

1301
02:15:50,909 --> 02:15:57,616
ln that case... Who arethose rowdies
attacked you on that day?.

1302
02:15:57,616 --> 02:16:03,145
Some greatman only
sent thosepeople.

1303
02:16:05,790 --> 02:16:07,826
As Gowryhas got
a research mind...!

1304
02:16:07,826 --> 02:16:11,596
Shewent to library & read all
thematters aboutthatking.

1305
02:16:11,596 --> 02:16:14,533
Shesigned both oftheir
signaturein theledger.

1306
02:16:14,533 --> 02:16:16,899
Both thenames...?
-Yes, priest.

1307
02:16:18,270 --> 02:16:22,207
She signed her nameas Gowry in
English before taking the book...!

1308
02:16:22,207 --> 02:16:27,975
Shesigned hername as Nagavalli in
Telugu whilereturningthatbook.

1309
02:16:30,615 --> 02:16:33,675
Shereads the
book as Gowry.

1310
02:16:35,220 --> 02:16:38,656
Shechanges as Nagavalli
whilereadingthat book.

1311
02:16:40,458 --> 02:16:47,332
Gowry read & knew thatking's
tortures towards Nagavalli.

1312
02:16:47,332 --> 02:16:52,170
As Gowryin orderto know more
information about Ramanathan...!

1313
02:16:52,170 --> 02:16:55,571
Shewentto Nagavalli's
house in Pethapuram.

1314
02:16:59,844 --> 02:17:02,472
She went into that
houseas Gowry.

1315
02:17:04,683 --> 02:17:11,714
Shecameoutwith Nagavalli's photo
getting changed as Nagavalli completely.

1316
02:17:12,157 --> 02:17:16,594
Gowry dances today also in front
ofthat photo in out house.

1317
02:17:17,596 --> 02:17:19,864
Come, man!

1318
02:17:19,864 --> 02:17:23,835
Bridegroom, who came fortheir betrothal on
that day, ran off fearing forsomething.

1319
02:17:23,835 --> 02:17:26,538
When l asked him the
reason for his fear...

1320
02:17:26,538 --> 02:17:29,974
l didn't forget that day's
incident today also.

1321
02:17:31,009 --> 02:17:32,911
When l was thereon that day...

1322
02:17:32,911 --> 02:17:36,715
You man! Do you want me?

02:17:36,715 --> 02:17:39,084
Do you want to marryme?

1324
02:17:39,084 --> 02:17:41,186
Do you know me?

1325
02:17:41,186 --> 02:17:44,489
Nagavalli, man.

1326
02:17:44,489 --> 02:17:47,726
lf you want to marry
hereafteralso...

02:17:47,726 --> 02:17:49,494
l will murder you.

1328
02:17:49,494 --> 02:17:54,666
Go off from here
with respect.

1329

of someother girl.

1330
02:18:01,840 --> 02:18:06,678
Gowry camedown & sat with
everybody likean innocent girl.

1331
02:18:06,678 --> 02:18:16,815
Saraswathi got Nagavalli's photo as aprize.
Geetha wantedto draw her painting.

1332
02:18:20,158 --> 02:18:24,754
But Gowry changed
as Nagavalli totally.

1333
02:18:32,237 --> 02:18:35,974
When wearehappy about our
elder daughter's recovery...

daughter Saraswathi.

mytomorrow's Pooja.

1345
02:19:19,984 --> 02:19:25,422
You can't destroy that king

Priest!

1350

Priest, who told that he'd cure
my daughter, has gotthis state.

1351
02:20:14,005 --> 02:20:17,338
Who can save our Gowry from
that Nagavalli hereafter?
