1
00:00:23,618 --> 00:00:26,416
Hello, listen, it's me

2
00:00:27,288 --> 00:00:30,587
The boss says he had
better come around now

3
00:00:31,959 --> 00:00:33,927
He had better kept silent

4
00:00:34,962 --> 00:00:41,094
If he won't be paid off, then
use another method, get it?

5
00:01:01,322 --> 00:01:03,290
It's me

6
00:01:03,491 --> 00:01:05,459
Get him out of the way!

7
00:01:06,327 --> 00:01:10,457
If need be, pay him. Or else,
have him removed. All right?

8
00:03:47,988 --> 00:03:49,956
Take this to the printing room

9
00:03:55,496 --> 00:03:56,793
Who's calling?

10
00:03:56,997 --> 00:04:00,296
Remember the man who has
been very good to you?

11
00:04:02,503 --> 00:04:04,471
I've made my decision
very clear

12
00:04:05,005 --> 00:04:07,803
We must know if you'll see
our point of view

13
00:04:08,275 --> 00:04:10,800
My newspaper always
prints the truth

14
00:04:11,178 --> 00:04:12,475
Is that your last word?

15
00:04:12,947 --> 00:04:17,475
Yes! Neither money nor threat
will make me change my mind

16
00:04:46,547 --> 00:04:48,845
Inspector Shekhar, please

17
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:59,691
A call from the
Bombay Times Office

18
00:05:00,161 --> 00:05:04,530
I'm coming. Here...

19
00:05:08,736 --> 00:05:12,695
Constable, I've been here all
day. My feet are aching

20
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,035
- Please be patient
- How can I be?

21
00:05:15,242 --> 00:05:18,871
Sir, I've been robbed

22
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:21,547
- What is it?
- Sir, he's gone

23
00:05:22,082 --> 00:05:25,051
- Who are you talking about?
- He's vanished again

24
00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:29,549
- Can you tell me his name?
- Oh, Lord! What can I say?

25
00:05:31,258 --> 00:05:33,055
How can I tell you his name?

26
00:05:33,194 --> 00:05:38,894
- It's like a ball that sinks
- You mean the moon?

27
00:05:39,433 --> 00:05:45,895
- No, not the moon. It sparkles
- "Star'? You mean Tarachand?

28
00:05:46,273 --> 00:05:48,241
Ramsingh, look after the case!

29
00:05:50,444 --> 00:05:54,744
I've told you a thousand times
go to the police station

30
00:05:55,115 --> 00:06:00,417
I've been there so often, that
I'm exhausted. I won't go again

31
00:06:03,123 --> 00:06:06,581
I'll tell the superintendent,
the commissioner,

32
00:06:06,961 --> 00:06:10,920
I'll lodge a complaint, I'll
write to the home minister

33
00:06:11,065 --> 00:06:15,434
You call me here everyday, you
cross-examine me

34
00:06:16,136 --> 00:06:21,096
Look into my eyes. Do I look
like a thief?

35
00:06:21,475 --> 00:06:23,443
We'll have to find out

36
00:06:34,321 --> 00:06:37,290
Mr. Srivastav, what made you
think of me today?

37
00:06:37,758 --> 00:06:40,625
I needed help so I
thought of you

38
00:06:40,995 --> 00:06:42,792
Police help? How can we?

39
00:06:43,097 --> 00:06:46,624
Someone is threatening
to kill me

40
00:06:47,501 --> 00:06:50,959
Who is it?
- Someone. It'd help if you came over

41
00:06:55,509 --> 00:06:58,808
What's new, Inspector?
Any murder, any robbery?

42
00:06:58,946 --> 00:07:01,471
Mr. Banerjee, this is the C.I.D.
Office, not a news agency

43
00:07:02,683 --> 00:07:08,144
I know. You realise that as a
reporter I must make public...

44
00:07:08,289 --> 00:07:10,257
...all that takes place
in this city?

45
00:07:10,691 --> 00:07:12,659
Don't bother me!

46
00:07:21,135 --> 00:07:23,160
Give this for typesetting

47
00:08:29,269 --> 00:08:30,236
What is it?

48
00:08:35,609 --> 00:08:37,907
Who are you? What do you want?

49
00:10:13,707 --> 00:10:15,675
Who was he?

50
00:10:18,378 --> 00:10:21,347
Phone the hospital!
The police!

51
00:10:24,551 --> 00:10:26,849
Where's the fellow who was
standing near the lift?

52
00:10:31,225 --> 00:10:35,025
There's been a murder at the
Bombay Times Office...

53
00:11:09,096 --> 00:11:12,395
- Follow that car!
- Why? Who are you?

54
00:11:12,599 --> 00:11:15,227
I'm a C.I.D. Officer. We've got
to follow that car

55
00:11:15,602 --> 00:11:17,069
I don't need to

56
00:11:20,607 --> 00:11:21,904
Then I will

57
00:11:44,464 --> 00:11:46,762
Stop the car.
I said, stop the car!

58
00:11:49,636 --> 00:11:51,604
Can you see it?

59
00:11:53,473 --> 00:11:55,100
What do I care?

60
00:11:55,242 --> 00:11:59,611
There's a killer escaping. Let
me get him. I'll return the car...

61
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:00,947
with thanks

62
00:12:01,148 --> 00:12:04,276
Before you arrest "him', I'll
have "you' arrested

63
00:12:04,818 --> 00:12:07,116
I've told you, I'm a
C.I.D. Officer

64
00:12:08,488 --> 00:12:10,456
You look more like a murderer

65
00:12:25,339 --> 00:12:28,968
- Is that car following us?
- It looks like it

66
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,477
Drive faster!

67
00:12:34,181 --> 00:12:36,149
You won't catch up with them

68
00:12:36,516 --> 00:12:39,974
Don't worry. I'll overtake them
as soon as I can

69
00:12:55,702 --> 00:13:00,162
If you're a gentleman, you'll
get me home at once

70
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,839
I assure you, I'll take you home,
safe and sound

71
00:13:44,584 --> 00:13:46,552
Are we to follow them all night?

72
00:13:47,087 --> 00:13:49,055
I won't stop until I've got them

73
00:14:08,608 --> 00:14:10,576
Drive faster!

74
00:14:32,966 --> 00:14:34,934
Look, the car stopped.
They've pulled over

75
00:14:38,972 --> 00:14:40,940
Check the license plate!

76
00:14:42,809 --> 00:14:44,936
What is it? Give me the key

77
00:14:47,214 --> 00:14:48,181
The key!

78
00:14:57,491 --> 00:15:00,949
Do you realise that a murderer
has got away because of you?

79
00:15:04,164 --> 00:15:06,132
If you want to get home, you'll
have to search for the keys

80
00:15:08,135 --> 00:15:09,295
In this rain?

81
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,638
If you don't want to get wet,
then sit here

82
00:15:44,371 --> 00:15:45,338
I can't find them

83
00:15:47,707 --> 00:15:50,175
I'm off. I'll go and
look for help

84
00:15:52,379 --> 00:15:53,346
Wait!

85
00:15:55,882 --> 00:15:57,850
I'll be all alone

86
00:16:01,221 --> 00:16:03,189
Aren't you afraid of me?

87
00:16:05,892 --> 00:16:10,022
All right. Sit in the back.
We'll look for the keys later

88
00:16:28,248 --> 00:16:29,374
Are you cold?

89
00:17:51,097 --> 00:17:55,625
"Why not guess my name?
I live by the bank of the river"

90
00:17:56,002 --> 00:18:00,632
"In my yard, a swaying pipal tree
spreads its cool shade over me"

91
00:18:25,198 --> 00:18:29,828
"People call me crazy,
as my hair flies in the breeze"

92
00:18:35,141 --> 00:18:39,009
"A black mole enhances my beauty.
My face is as fair as could be"

93
00:18:44,718 --> 00:18:48,677
"On the winding streets I wander,
young men stare in stupor"

94
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:28,220
"Be careful today,
when you look my way"

95
00:19:33,266 --> 00:19:37,566
"As you gaze at my hair,
you'll be caught in a snare"

96
00:19:43,343 --> 00:19:47,905
"Whenever I walk,
I gather hearts"

97
00:20:22,482 --> 00:20:26,612
"Those who have a heart to lose,
I am a woman of ill repute"

98
00:20:31,991 --> 00:20:36,451
"I am a mystery, that is my fame,
but why not guess my name?"

99
00:20:42,001 --> 00:20:46,461
"It's time to go. Will you
ask me where I'll travel?"

100
00:21:38,057 --> 00:21:40,025
- What is it?
- Police

101
00:21:44,063 --> 00:21:48,693
- Where were you at that time?
- I was at the press. He sent me

102
00:21:50,069 --> 00:21:52,037
He sent you there?

103
00:21:55,575 --> 00:21:58,043
- Who else was there?
- I believe...

104
00:21:58,244 --> 00:22:00,371
Who else was there?

105
00:22:00,914 --> 00:22:02,882
No one. The editor was alone

106
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:06,874
The morning shift had left.
The night shift hadn't come

107
00:22:14,427 --> 00:22:16,395
Was the phone in this position?

108
00:22:17,263 --> 00:22:19,231
- Any fingerprints?
- I'm checking

109
00:22:25,104 --> 00:22:27,072
He may not survive

110
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:33,408
- Made any arrests?
- We're holding someone

111
00:22:43,957 --> 00:22:45,925
Weren't you following a lead?

112
00:22:49,963 --> 00:22:51,931
Any conclusions?

113
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,767
- Who are you?
- The sub-editor

114
00:23:08,481 --> 00:23:11,109
- Did the editor smoke?
- No, nor did he eat 'paan'

115
00:23:36,175 --> 00:23:39,975
- Your name?
- Master

116
00:23:41,514 --> 00:23:44,642
- Occupation?
- I'm a cutter-tailor

117
00:23:46,019 --> 00:23:48,487
I cut coats and trousers

118
00:23:48,855 --> 00:23:51,824
If I need money, I'm known
to cut pockets, too

119
00:23:53,526 --> 00:23:55,653
Why were you at the office?

120
00:23:56,529 --> 00:23:58,997
My stomach and brain
are empty

121
00:23:59,365 --> 00:24:02,334
With some tea, my brain will
start working

122
00:24:02,535 --> 00:24:05,663
Shut up!
I'll set your brain right

123
00:24:09,876 --> 00:24:12,174
Why were you there?
- To put an Ad

124
00:24:13,546 --> 00:24:16,174
- An advertisement? What for?
- For a bride

125
00:24:17,383 --> 00:24:19,351
For whom?

126
00:24:23,222 --> 00:24:25,520
- Don't you understand?
- Be quiet!

127
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,188
A bride for me
- You fool!

128
00:24:33,232 --> 00:24:35,530
- Whose marriage?
- Who is she?

129
00:24:35,735 --> 00:24:37,862
She was my wife to be

130
00:24:38,905 --> 00:24:40,873
I mean, she is my wife to be

131
00:24:42,241 --> 00:24:43,708
Then why place an
advertisement?

132
00:24:43,843 --> 00:24:48,212
The advertisement was to
look for work

133
00:24:48,414 --> 00:24:51,042
To her it's work, and to me
it's marriage?

134
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,878
She's the one I'll marry.
I'll work anywhere

135
00:24:55,188 --> 00:24:58,214
You talk to me of marriage,
and to her of work

136
00:24:58,758 --> 00:25:02,717
What do you mean?
Aren't you ashamed?

137
00:25:03,096 --> 00:25:06,896
You told me you'll marry me.
Who is this other girl?

138
00:25:07,266 --> 00:25:09,734
Do you both want to be
put in the lock-up?

139
00:25:10,603 --> 00:25:13,401
Sorry, Inspector.
This man is insane

140
00:25:13,606 --> 00:25:17,906
This isn't your home.
Now, what do you want?

141
00:25:19,112 --> 00:25:21,239
- To stand bail
- Impossible!

142
00:25:22,448 --> 00:25:24,416
It's a murder charge
- Murder?

143
00:25:29,789 --> 00:25:31,757
Constable, take her away

144
00:25:41,134 --> 00:25:45,093
- I'm glad you've come
- What are you doing here?

145
00:25:45,471 --> 00:25:47,598
He was found at the
scene of the crime

146
00:25:48,307 --> 00:25:54,268
You know me very well. Help me.
He doesn't know me

147
00:25:54,814 --> 00:25:56,611
Why were you at the
Bombay Times office?

148
00:25:56,816 --> 00:25:59,944
Someone did his job before I...

149
00:26:00,153 --> 00:26:01,051
What nonsense!

150
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:04,951
I haven't done anything,
I'm innocent

151
00:26:05,491 --> 00:26:10,292
I've spent all my life cutting
cloth, never throats

152
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:13,128
- Did you see who did it?
- Of course!

153
00:26:13,499 --> 00:26:15,967
I saw him go in and come out
again

154
00:26:16,502 --> 00:26:21,303
He had eyes as big as a 100 watt
bulb. Built like a wrestler

155
00:26:21,507 --> 00:26:23,134
I was trembling with fear

156
00:26:23,276 --> 00:26:27,303
- Can you identify him?
- I can identify his entire clan

157
00:26:32,185 --> 00:26:33,652
- You can leave
- Really!

158
00:26:33,786 --> 00:26:38,314
Stop pick pocketing or you'll
be in for life

159
00:26:46,365 --> 00:26:49,823
He's a mere pickpocket.
I know him well

160
00:26:51,871 --> 00:26:53,839
But keep an eye on him

161
00:27:09,155 --> 00:27:12,682
"O gentle heart...
life is an uphill struggle"

162
00:27:13,059 --> 00:27:16,859
"Be alert, be street wise.
This is Bombay, my love"

163
00:27:47,426 --> 00:27:51,385
"There are buildings and trams,
and motor cars and mills"

164
00:27:51,931 --> 00:27:55,890
"There is everything to be had,
except a heart's thrills"

165
00:28:05,211 --> 00:28:08,738
"There's not a trace of humanity
in this bustling city"

166
00:28:35,474 --> 00:28:39,433
"Some play the numbers, some
go to the races, others thieve"

167
00:28:39,812 --> 00:28:43,942
"Some starve, some suffer
insults, others grieve"

168
00:28:52,825 --> 00:28:56,625
"Yet the idle manage
to make both ends meet"

169
00:29:23,356 --> 00:29:27,315
"Here, vagabonds is another
name for the homeless"

170
00:29:27,693 --> 00:29:31,652
"While others cut throats,
and that's called business"

171
00:29:40,706 --> 00:29:44,506
"It may be the same game,
but it goes under many a name"

172
00:30:11,904 --> 00:30:15,533
"You call the world unfair,
don't be so naive, beware"

173
00:30:15,908 --> 00:30:19,537
"You will reap what you sow,
that's the name of the game"

174
00:30:29,255 --> 00:30:32,884
"Flexing your muscles
won't make old Bombay tame"

175
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,928
Any news?

176
00:31:11,797 --> 00:31:15,255
You're right, Sir. There's
hashish mixed into this tobacco

177
00:31:17,636 --> 00:31:20,104
Get me the file on the criminals
who deal in narcotics

178
00:31:26,312 --> 00:31:29,110
- Did you find anything out?
- No, nothing

179
00:31:29,648 --> 00:31:32,116
I'm hoping when Srivastav
regains consciousness...

180
00:31:32,818 --> 00:31:35,116
I am sorry, Shekhar...

181
00:31:35,654 --> 00:31:39,283
...the hospital phoned.
Srivastav is dead

182
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,958
Why would anyone want
to kill such a noble man?

183
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:47,632
Bad news

184
00:31:48,334 --> 00:31:53,465
I'm sure there are at least
two people involved

185
00:31:55,341 --> 00:31:59,300
One who committed the crime,
the other who engineered it

186
00:32:02,181 --> 00:32:04,308
- Have you discern that, or?
- Here, look.

187
00:32:06,685 --> 00:32:10,314
Srivastav sent in this article
just before he was attacked

188
00:32:11,023 --> 00:32:14,151
He was about to expose someone
important...

189
00:32:15,194 --> 00:32:19,654
...but he was killed before he
could accomplish that

190
00:32:22,701 --> 00:32:28,662
- Have you found any clues?
- A cigarette

191
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:36,512
4 million people live here,
at least a million smoke

192
00:32:36,715 --> 00:32:40,014
Those who smoke hashish can be
counted among thousands

193
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:09,047
Here's our man

194
00:33:10,749 --> 00:33:12,717
Bring him to me!

195
00:34:24,657 --> 00:34:27,785
- Ibrahim, let's have another
- All right, then

196
00:34:49,014 --> 00:34:51,141
How are things with you,
Shersingh?

197
00:34:56,355 --> 00:34:58,323
- Who's he?
- A friend

198
00:34:59,858 --> 00:35:02,326
Here...
- A cigarette?

199
00:35:05,531 --> 00:35:07,499
I don't like his face

200
00:35:08,867 --> 00:35:10,835
Your name?

201
00:35:11,537 --> 00:35:15,337
Editor Srivastav

202
00:35:38,731 --> 00:35:40,699
Who picked my pocket?

203
00:35:41,567 --> 00:35:43,535
- Lost much?
- 8 annas

204
00:35:45,237 --> 00:35:47,205
Take the packet. Pay me later

205
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:54,538
A packet of 'peela Haathi'
and a 'paan'

206
00:35:55,914 --> 00:35:58,712
Posing as a millionaire without
a penny!

207
00:35:58,851 --> 00:36:02,548
That's the trouble. You think
I'm a good-for-nothing

208
00:36:04,256 --> 00:36:06,224
So you picked his pocket?

209
00:36:06,759 --> 00:36:12,720
Here's 8 annas. Fill the
'paan' with my unrequited love

210
00:36:17,603 --> 00:36:19,400
- It's a counterfeit
- Counterfeit?

211
00:36:19,605 --> 00:36:23,564
The crook! Fancy clothes and
empty pockets

212
00:36:23,942 --> 00:36:27,400
Poison disguised as nectar!
What's going on?

213
00:36:29,615 --> 00:36:31,583
To the police station!

214
00:36:31,717 --> 00:36:33,241
- Why?
- You'll see

215
00:36:33,385 --> 00:36:35,250
Here's 8 annas, tell me now

216
00:36:35,621 --> 00:36:38,419
Join the police. You visit
them each day

217
00:36:38,724 --> 00:36:41,420
There'll be no need to have
a police force

218
00:36:42,127 --> 00:36:47,258
If there are no thieves,
there won't be any thefts

219
00:36:47,633 --> 00:36:49,601
You'll go hungry

220
00:36:50,469 --> 00:36:52,937
Why are you taking me?
I'm innocent

221
00:36:53,972 --> 00:36:55,269
It isn't theft

222
00:36:55,574 --> 00:36:59,943
Then why? It's not on a
murder charge, is it?

223
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,610
Inspector Shekhar knows
I didn't do it

224
00:37:04,983 --> 00:37:07,110
He'll be there. You tell him

225
00:37:10,489 --> 00:37:13,458
My love, caress my neck
for the last time...

226
00:37:13,726 --> 00:37:16,627
...it's heading straight
for the noose

227
00:37:18,497 --> 00:37:20,965
You've been called to
identify the killer

228
00:37:21,166 --> 00:37:23,634
You've got him? Let's go

229
00:37:26,672 --> 00:37:29,300
Wait! Is he securely bound?

230
00:37:29,675 --> 00:37:34,635
I'm not scared. But I don't get
on well with cut throats

231
00:37:48,694 --> 00:37:52,824
Well? Will you be able
to identify the murderer?

232
00:37:53,031 --> 00:37:54,658
- At once!
- Scared?

233
00:37:54,867 --> 00:37:59,497
Scared? Me?
I have a lion's heart

234
00:37:59,872 --> 00:38:02,841
Who is the man you saw at the
Bombay Times office?

235
00:38:13,218 --> 00:38:15,186
Identify him!

236
00:38:39,411 --> 00:38:41,879
If looks could kill, I'd be...

237
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:45,049
Don't worry. We're with you.
Tell us who he is

238
00:38:46,585 --> 00:38:49,383
- Point him out. Which one?
- That one

239
00:38:49,588 --> 00:38:51,556
Speak up!

240
00:38:51,757 --> 00:38:54,225
Black coat!

241
00:38:54,426 --> 00:38:57,884
It wasn't me. He's lying.
I'll fix you

242
00:38:58,931 --> 00:39:02,059
Take him away!
You may leave

243
00:39:07,272 --> 00:39:09,240
Shekhar, wake up!

244
00:42:01,947 --> 00:42:06,407
"Enchanted by a first love,
eyes filled with sweet dreams"

245
00:42:06,618 --> 00:42:10,748
"From the realm of magic,
appeared a magician"

246
00:42:43,255 --> 00:42:47,282
"A cloud of fine hair
blows over your face"

247
00:42:47,659 --> 00:42:51,459
"Don't walk away,
turn around and stay"

248
00:43:01,006 --> 00:43:05,966
"He stands at your door,
eyes filled with sweet dreams"

249
00:43:33,538 --> 00:43:37,338
"Your eyes may flash
with anger now..."

250
00:43:37,709 --> 00:43:41,839
"...but cupid's bow
will smooth your brow"

251
00:43:51,556 --> 00:43:56,186
"You'll soon surrender under
the magician's spell"

252
00:44:23,555 --> 00:44:27,548
"Hearing you talk,
she begins to break into a smile"

253
00:44:27,926 --> 00:44:31,885
"See how the laughter
gathers at her lips"

254
00:44:41,573 --> 00:44:46,408
"Despite herself, her face reveals
the love her anger veils"

255
00:44:46,611 --> 00:44:50,741
"From the realm of magic,
appeared a magician"

256
00:45:16,975 --> 00:45:18,943
If you value your life,
go away

257
00:45:21,813 --> 00:45:24,941
Take another step,
and you go to jail

258
00:45:25,483 --> 00:45:30,113
This is the S. P's home.
- I know I'm here to see him.

259
00:45:30,522 --> 00:45:32,956
The call of death is irresistible.

260
00:45:33,325 --> 00:45:35,293
Come in. I'll take care of you.

261
00:45:37,829 --> 00:45:39,797
After you.

262
00:45:51,676 --> 00:45:53,644
You're so impolite

263
00:46:13,865 --> 00:46:15,992
Making yourself at home, eh?

264
00:46:16,868 --> 00:46:19,336
May I have a glass of water?

265
00:46:20,038 --> 00:46:23,166
You'll even get a lemonade.
Let father come

266
00:46:24,709 --> 00:46:27,337
- Yes. My father.
- Your?

267
00:46:31,549 --> 00:46:33,346
- Father, see...
- What is it?

268
00:46:33,551 --> 00:46:36,019
- That man's here again
- What man?

269
00:46:36,221 --> 00:46:38,519
- The man who took my car
- Where is he?

270
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:40,357
He is sitting there.

271
00:46:42,694 --> 00:46:47,028
First, it was the car,
Now, he's followed me in

272
00:46:49,401 --> 00:46:50,868
- Do you mean him?
- Yes.

273
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:03,547
- My daughter Rekha
- Delighted to meet you

274
00:47:06,251 --> 00:47:08,219
Rekha has a bone
to pick with you

275
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:14,381
I needed a car to follow a
suspect. I had no choice

276
00:47:15,927 --> 00:47:17,895
Excuse me, please.

277
00:47:21,266 --> 00:47:24,235
Instead of lemonade,
may I have some water?

278
00:47:24,936 --> 00:47:26,904
I'm sorry. I made a mistake

279
00:47:27,272 --> 00:47:32,403
The mistake was fortunate or
else how would we have met?

280
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,917
Since when did you know him?

281
00:47:51,629 --> 00:47:55,759
What did you have against him?
Why did you kill him?

282
00:47:58,803 --> 00:48:04,605
Silence won't save you
from hanging

283
00:48:10,148 --> 00:48:13,447
At 8.07, you entered the
Bombay Times office...

284
00:48:14,652 --> 00:48:17,120
at 8.10 Srivastav was killed

285
00:48:17,655 --> 00:48:22,786
At 8.12 you left the office,
at 8.14 I saw you near the lift

286
00:48:24,329 --> 00:48:30,131
Fool! Death is as close to you
as this chair before you

287
00:48:31,169 --> 00:48:33,137
A call for you, Sir

288
00:48:33,671 --> 00:48:37,471
Srivastav didn't hurt a fly.
He was a noble man...

289
00:48:38,176 --> 00:48:41,304
...and you killed him.
You'll pay

290
00:48:41,679 --> 00:48:46,480
Sooner or later, you'll tell us
why you killed him. Understand?

291
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:59,819
- Who is it?
- We've never met

292
00:49:00,198 --> 00:49:03,326
Your name?
- I can't tell you

293
00:49:04,702 --> 00:49:08,832
Can I be of help?
- Actually, I can help 'you'

294
00:49:09,207 --> 00:49:11,175
Help me?
- Yes.

295
00:49:11,876 --> 00:49:16,336
I have some information about
Srivastav's murder...

296
00:49:17,048 --> 00:49:19,016
...which will most probably
fascinate you

297
00:49:19,717 --> 00:49:22,845
Come over then
- I can't.

298
00:49:23,721 --> 00:49:28,181
You'll have to come to see me
- Where are you?

299
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:31,188
You must come here
- But how?

300
00:49:31,496 --> 00:49:35,865
My car is parked in front
of your office

301
00:49:36,734 --> 00:49:41,034
Licence plate BMZ 1454

302
00:49:41,739 --> 00:49:44,867
Get into the car. My driver
will bring you here

303
00:50:03,094 --> 00:50:06,063
- Are you here for me?
- Yes. Sit down

304
00:50:18,443 --> 00:50:20,411
So you prefer tinted glass?

305
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:25,578
- Don't you find it too dark?
- I'm used to it

306
00:50:41,466 --> 00:50:45,266
- Some cool breeze preferably?
- I'm not used to it.

307
00:50:48,139 --> 00:50:50,107
Don't you find it stuffy?

308
00:50:50,808 --> 00:50:56,440
It's dangerous for us
to be seen together

309
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:05,118
- Where are we going?
- You'll see

310
00:53:13,685 --> 00:53:15,653
Do sit down

311
00:53:21,125 --> 00:53:24,424
What can you tell me
about the murder case?

312
00:53:25,963 --> 00:53:28,932
Case? What case?

313
00:53:29,634 --> 00:53:34,094
You told me you could shed
some light on the matter

314
00:53:37,141 --> 00:53:41,441
Shed light? I don't like light

315
00:53:42,146 --> 00:53:44,114
Why call me here?

316
00:53:45,316 --> 00:53:48,285
I hear you like parrots

317
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:51,618
Parrots?
- Yes, parrots

318
00:53:55,326 --> 00:53:57,294
I suppose I do

319
00:53:57,595 --> 00:54:01,793
- What about you?
- Only one kind... a mute one

320
00:54:02,333 --> 00:54:05,461
They're worthless.
They won't fetch 4 annas

321
00:54:05,803 --> 00:54:08,966
Name your price,
I'll pay well

322
00:54:09,507 --> 00:54:12,476
A thousand, two thousand,
five thousand

323
00:54:13,244 --> 00:54:15,474
- You own such a parrot
- No

324
00:54:15,847 --> 00:54:18,475
The one I own is a chatterbox

325
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:20,980
A new parrot entered
your cage recently

326
00:54:22,186 --> 00:54:24,484
You've tried hard to
make him talk...

327
00:54:25,623 --> 00:54:27,591
so far he hasn't

328
00:54:30,027 --> 00:54:31,995
That one?
- Yes.

329
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:34,498
So you understand me now

330
00:54:35,199 --> 00:54:37,167
I'll pay any price you want
10,000, 20,000, 50,000

331
00:54:42,573 --> 00:54:46,339
Is it a deal?
- Find yourself another parrot.

332
00:54:46,711 --> 00:54:51,341
I won't sell
Bribing is an offence

333
00:54:51,816 --> 00:54:56,344
A bribe? I'm not
bribing anyone

334
00:54:57,054 --> 00:54:59,352
If you won't sell, then don't

335
00:55:00,057 --> 00:55:05,017
- Why get angry?
- I'll have you arrested

336
00:55:05,563 --> 00:55:07,531
Go ahead, Inspector

337
00:55:17,608 --> 00:55:19,371
He refuses to sell

338
00:55:19,744 --> 00:55:23,874
How high did you bid?
What was your offer, 50,000?

339
00:55:24,215 --> 00:55:27,048
He refused
- He's left?

340
00:55:27,418 --> 00:55:29,716
He's here, unconscious

341
00:55:30,421 --> 00:55:34,881
Good. Have him dumped
- Where?

342
00:55:35,259 --> 00:55:37,386
On the Bombay-Agra road

343
00:55:38,095 --> 00:55:43,897
He mustn't know where he was
Be careful!

344
00:56:20,304 --> 00:56:22,272
Rekha! It's you?

345
00:56:25,643 --> 00:56:28,111
- How did I get here?
- You were brought here.

346
00:56:29,981 --> 00:56:32,279
You were lying unconscious
on the Bombay-Agra road

347
00:56:33,484 --> 00:56:35,452
What's happening?

348
00:56:40,324 --> 00:56:42,451
Your friends are waiting

349
00:56:44,662 --> 00:56:47,790
- Do you feel better?
- Much better, Sir

350
00:56:48,666 --> 00:56:52,625
I'm sorry to be a bother,
coming here in this state

351
00:56:52,837 --> 00:56:55,806
Regard this as your home.
But what happened?

352
00:56:56,674 --> 00:57:01,805
I was following a lead on
the Srivastav case.

353
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,978
I was offered a drink
and then...

354
00:57:06,851 --> 00:57:09,820
It can wait.
We'll talk later

355
00:57:10,521 --> 00:57:13,490
It's Rekha's birthday.
Freshen up and come down

356
00:57:31,042 --> 00:57:32,168
Happy Birthday!

357
00:57:32,376 --> 00:57:36,836
- Where were you?
- I am here now. Some cake?

358
00:57:37,048 --> 00:57:39,016
You won't get it.

359
00:57:41,385 --> 00:57:43,353
- Here, have it.
- No, thanks.

360
00:57:43,554 --> 00:57:46,853
Why? You will have to.

361
00:57:53,364 --> 00:57:58,028
- I fast on Tuesdays
- It is only fruit, Dharamdasji

362
00:57:58,235 --> 00:58:02,194
- I don't touch fruit, either
- Such principles!

363
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:08,042
- You are opening a hospital?
- It's my duty to serve

364
00:58:08,579 --> 00:58:11,047
You are a benevolent man

365
00:58:11,749 --> 00:58:17,210
Meet Mr. Dharamdas, a well
known citizen of Bombay

366
00:58:19,423 --> 00:58:22,221
Pleased to meet you
- He helps everyone

367
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:26,389
Just today, he donated Rs. 5,000
to Srivastav's family

368
00:58:26,597 --> 00:58:28,724
Don't embarrass me, Mr. Mathur

369
00:58:30,101 --> 00:58:34,231
Have you made any progress on
Srivastav's case?

370
00:58:35,106 --> 00:58:37,574
- It's his case, ask him
- Well...

371
00:58:56,794 --> 00:59:00,423
- I haven't seen you for ages
- It's been four years

372
00:59:00,631 --> 00:59:04,260
Four years! They've flown
by like four days

373
00:59:05,136 --> 00:59:08,594
You're lucky to think of
four years as four days

374
00:59:08,806 --> 00:59:11,775
I have so much to talk
to you about

375
00:59:15,813 --> 00:59:18,111
- I must leave
- Already?

376
00:59:23,487 --> 00:59:25,455
- Come along, Kamini
- No, I must leave

377
00:59:29,326 --> 00:59:33,456
- Srivastav's case?
- Nothing so far

378
00:59:37,668 --> 00:59:39,636
Excuse me.

379
00:59:40,004 --> 00:59:41,972
Where have you been?

380
00:59:42,673 --> 00:59:46,803
- You look pale
- Trouble with Income Tax?

381
01:00:46,904 --> 01:00:51,204
Kamini, meet Inspector Shekhar

382
01:00:52,409 --> 01:00:54,707
- Pleased to meet you
- For the second time

383
01:00:55,079 --> 01:00:57,047
- The second time?
- Yes

384
01:00:57,414 --> 01:00:59,882
Then, you were after a parrot

385
01:01:00,417 --> 01:01:03,215
- A parrot?
- You offered 50,000

386
01:01:04,088 --> 01:01:06,056
I'm serious

387
01:01:08,592 --> 01:01:12,551
What's wrong with you?
Come on, let's go

388
01:01:27,778 --> 01:01:32,078
- She's the same girl
- She's a close friend

389
01:01:32,449 --> 01:01:35,077
- I'm leaving, Rekha
- Why the hurry?

390
01:01:35,286 --> 01:01:37,914
It's quite late.
Bye!

391
01:01:52,303 --> 01:01:56,262
- What are you doing here?
- Rekha asked me over

392
01:01:57,308 --> 01:01:59,776
- How long have you known her?
- We are childhood friends

393
01:02:00,477 --> 01:02:02,445
We've no friends here

394
01:02:03,981 --> 01:02:08,281
They're all police officers.
They can send you to your death

395
01:02:09,987 --> 01:02:11,955
Did Shekhar realise
who you were?

396
01:02:12,323 --> 01:02:15,622
I fooled him...

397
01:02:16,327 --> 01:02:18,124
...but I think he suspects
something

398
01:02:18,329 --> 01:02:22,629
Leave the city before
his suspicions are confirmed

399
01:02:24,168 --> 01:02:26,136
Keep clear of the C.I.D.

400
01:02:27,504 --> 01:02:30,132
- You're leaving?
- Yes. I have some work

401
01:02:30,341 --> 01:02:32,309
- We'll meet again?
- Yes

402
01:02:53,030 --> 01:02:54,998
Where are you going?

403
01:02:55,366 --> 01:02:58,335
- I have some urgent work
- I know

404
01:02:58,702 --> 01:03:03,332
You'll follow her though
I've told you she's a friend

405
01:03:04,041 --> 01:03:08,501
Don't follow her
- I won't. I have work

406
01:03:08,879 --> 01:03:10,847
Do you, really?

407
01:03:12,049 --> 01:03:13,846
I don't care

408
01:03:14,051 --> 01:03:18,181
If you leave now, I'll
never talk to you again

409
01:05:12,836 --> 01:05:16,294
"In just an exchange
of glances..."

410
01:05:17,341 --> 01:05:20,640
"...we've found a new
meaning of life"

411
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:52,839
"Why do you sing a song as you
place a hand on your heart?"

412
01:05:53,210 --> 01:05:57,169
"Why do you look so lost?
What could the matter be?"

413
01:05:57,781 --> 01:06:00,841
"Since how long have you
been wandering aimlessly?"

414
01:06:37,754 --> 01:06:41,713
"You sway as you walk,
even your gait has changed"

415
01:06:42,092 --> 01:06:45,721
"Passion fills your eyes
as your hair flies"

416
01:06:46,096 --> 01:06:49,725
"What love has brought you
to feel this ecstasy?"

417
01:07:26,803 --> 01:07:30,603
"No more spurts of anger,
no more threats, nor danger"

418
01:07:30,974 --> 01:07:34,603
"Love has at last,
conquered your heart"

419
01:07:34,978 --> 01:07:38,436
"How did your heart find a
place for this thief?"

420
01:08:15,686 --> 01:08:19,315
"What is this love?
What is this magic spell?"

421
01:08:19,523 --> 01:08:23,653
"Open your heart to me.
Why keep love a secret?"

422
01:08:24,094 --> 01:08:27,495
"So you have given
your heart to me"

423
01:08:27,965 --> 01:08:31,662
"In just an exchange
of glances..."

424
01:08:32,869 --> 01:08:36,168
"...we've found a new
meaning to life"

425
01:09:04,234 --> 01:09:06,532
Who writes to you
so often?

426
01:09:13,410 --> 01:09:15,378
Throw me a glance
too, my love

427
01:09:16,246 --> 01:09:18,874
I saw it! I saw it!
- You saw what?

428
01:09:19,583 --> 01:09:23,041
The suit isn't yours.
Did you pick a 'big' pocket?

429
01:09:23,587 --> 01:09:25,555
Hush! Someone might hear

430
01:09:26,256 --> 01:09:29,225
- I'm not scared
- But I am

431
01:09:29,593 --> 01:09:35,054
I've changed my ways.
I've found myself a good job

432
01:09:39,770 --> 01:09:44,207
They give me fine
clothes to wear...

433
01:09:44,941 --> 01:09:46,909
...a car to travel
about in

434
01:09:48,278 --> 01:09:50,246
Do you mean the 'police van'?

435
01:09:50,947 --> 01:09:55,247
You're obsessed with the police...
I mean a real car

436
01:09:55,452 --> 01:09:57,750
It picks me up and
drops me home

437
01:09:58,288 --> 01:10:01,587
- Don't pull my leg
- Don't you believe me?

438
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:14,430
- Well, master?
- Look, the car's arrived

439
01:10:17,307 --> 01:10:19,275
Are you Master?
- Ofcourse!

440
01:10:20,811 --> 01:10:23,279
Did you see that?
They all know me here

441
01:10:23,914 --> 01:10:25,438
Hurry up!

442
01:10:29,152 --> 01:10:31,620
- What's up? Who is the car for?
- For you!

443
01:10:33,323 --> 01:10:36,622
See that? It's for me.
I wasn't joking, was I?

444
01:10:38,495 --> 01:10:41,464
- Is this a joke? Who are you?
- Your friend

445
01:10:41,998 --> 01:10:45,627
- Friend? Where are you from?
- Over there

446
01:10:47,003 --> 01:10:48,971
Let's make a move

447
01:10:52,342 --> 01:10:55,311
- It's your first day. Hurry
- Shall I go?

448
01:11:18,702 --> 01:11:22,502
Over here.
- Go ahead. I'll be right back

449
01:12:19,262 --> 01:12:22,060
- Sit down
- Thank you

450
01:12:23,099 --> 01:12:25,727
- Would you like some tea?
- Absolutely!

451
01:12:27,437 --> 01:12:28,404
Who is he?

452
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:32,567
Is he the witness
to the murder?

453
01:12:33,443 --> 01:12:35,411
Ask me! Yes, I am!

454
01:12:36,112 --> 01:12:39,081
- Can you identify the killer?
- Sure, I can

455
01:12:39,449 --> 01:12:42,748
If the killer were before you,
you'd know him?

456
01:12:43,453 --> 01:12:45,751
I've already identified him

457
01:12:45,956 --> 01:12:48,754
- Where?
- At the police station

458
01:12:50,293 --> 01:12:54,753
When I testify in court,
he'll be in for 20 years

459
01:12:55,665 --> 01:12:56,927
You won't go

460
01:12:58,134 --> 01:13:01,592
I beg your pardon?
Were you speaking to me?

461
01:13:03,807 --> 01:13:06,105
Why won't I
testify in court?

462
01:13:07,477 --> 01:13:09,445
Because I said so

463
01:13:10,146 --> 01:13:12,273
So! I won't go to court...

464
01:13:12,482 --> 01:13:14,279
because you're a gentleman

465
01:13:14,818 --> 01:13:20,450
How can you tell?
Fantastic! Aren't you clever?

466
01:13:21,324 --> 01:13:25,454
But how did you know?
- It's on your face

467
01:13:25,829 --> 01:13:32,462
'Uneasy lies the head that wears
the crown'. Then, there's you...

468
01:13:34,170 --> 01:13:37,298
Will you stand witness
for the police?

469
01:13:37,574 --> 01:13:40,475
Certainly, it's a
matter of principle

470
01:13:40,944 --> 01:13:43,970
- Won't you mend your ways?
- Certainly not!

471
01:13:49,686 --> 01:13:54,146
Why have I been brought here?
Who are you all?

472
01:13:54,724 --> 01:13:56,692
You will not testify!

473
01:13:57,694 --> 01:13:59,821
- We don't want you to
- But I do

474
01:14:06,536 --> 01:14:10,165
- So you'll testify, will you?
- Definitely!

475
01:14:14,644 --> 01:14:17,670
- Now will you testify?
- To what?

476
01:14:18,214 --> 01:14:21,672
- The Bombay Times office
- Where's that?

477
01:14:22,385 --> 01:14:25,354
- Can you identify the murderer?
- What murderer?

478
01:14:26,222 --> 01:14:30,181
- Will you go to the court?
- I'm going straight home

479
01:14:30,727 --> 01:14:33,855
I'm very sorry

480
01:14:43,573 --> 01:14:46,542
- What's up?
- The witness won't go to the court

481
01:14:46,910 --> 01:14:51,040
You think he won't testify
if he's threatened?

482
01:14:51,247 --> 01:14:53,215
- But you...
- I've changed my mind

483
01:14:54,250 --> 01:14:58,880
The case won't go to court.
It'll be settled in the cell

484
01:14:59,255 --> 01:15:01,223
- In the cell?
- Yes

485
01:15:06,429 --> 01:15:09,728
- I know nothing
- Yes, you do

486
01:15:10,767 --> 01:15:14,726
Here are your fingerprints

487
01:15:15,772 --> 01:15:20,072
Do you know where they were
found? On Srivastav's table...

488
01:15:20,443 --> 01:15:22,411
where you killed him

489
01:15:23,113 --> 01:15:25,581
Can you deny that these
are your fingerprints?

490
01:15:25,782 --> 01:15:28,751
Let me go. I'm innocent

491
01:15:29,786 --> 01:15:32,084
Shouting won't save you

492
01:15:32,789 --> 01:15:34,916
No one can save you...

493
01:15:35,792 --> 01:15:40,593
...unless you tell us
who's behind the murder

494
01:15:41,464 --> 01:15:46,265
Name the man who is
making you a scapegoat

495
01:15:46,636 --> 01:15:48,934
No one. I keep saying
'no one'

496
01:15:49,406 --> 01:15:51,374
I'll keep asking

497
01:15:51,508 --> 01:15:55,604
- Who is behind the murder?
- I'll go insane

498
01:15:56,146 --> 01:15:58,114
You'll still have to talk

499
01:16:00,150 --> 01:16:01,947
Whose orders did you obey?

500
01:16:02,152 --> 01:16:06,782
- Enough! Or I'll die
- Tell me, who they are

501
01:16:07,824 --> 01:16:12,454
I've told you,
I don't know anything

502
01:16:14,664 --> 01:16:17,292
Who are they?

503
01:16:27,510 --> 01:16:29,478
Take him away

504
01:16:35,518 --> 01:16:39,818
- Please sign here, Sir
- A call for you

505
01:17:24,567 --> 01:17:27,195
It's you? Why have you come?
To save me?

506
01:17:29,739 --> 01:17:33,368
Why won't you speak?
You've been sent to free me?

507
01:17:33,910 --> 01:17:35,878
Will I escape?

508
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:53,888
You'll be freed right away
- But how?

509
01:17:58,601 --> 01:18:00,569
What's going on?

510
01:18:14,050 --> 01:18:16,018
Where is everyone?

511
01:18:18,555 --> 01:18:20,250
- What's up?
- Trouble

512
01:18:20,456 --> 01:18:22,424
Open the door

513
01:18:40,143 --> 01:18:43,112
- Who is responsible for this?
- We don't know, Sir

514
01:18:43,813 --> 01:18:47,442
He staggered into the cell,
then collapsed

515
01:18:48,084 --> 01:18:51,281
- He was dead
- Did he die, or was he killed

516
01:18:51,654 --> 01:18:56,114
Inspector, you killed him
and now you accuse us?

517
01:18:56,259 --> 01:18:58,227
Nonsense!
- He is right

518
01:18:58,995 --> 01:19:00,622
Killer!

519
01:19:21,017 --> 01:19:22,985
Fool!

520
01:19:24,854 --> 01:19:28,483
- Who do you mean?
- Inspector Shekhar, who else?

521
01:19:29,692 --> 01:19:31,660
Watch the fun!

522
01:19:33,863 --> 01:19:36,161
He'll share the same fate
as the other

523
01:19:39,702 --> 01:19:43,001
- The other?
- The man who killed Srivastav

524
01:19:43,706 --> 01:19:45,674
A bad fate?

525
01:19:47,477 --> 01:19:49,502
Two birds with one stone

526
01:19:52,048 --> 01:19:55,506
If he'd stayed alive,
he would have talked

527
01:19:56,886 --> 01:20:00,014
That would have meant
the end of us...

528
01:20:00,723 --> 01:20:02,691
of you and me

529
01:20:04,227 --> 01:20:07,856
But murdering an accomplice?
- An accomplice?

530
01:20:09,565 --> 01:20:11,533
The fellow in jail

531
01:20:19,909 --> 01:20:23,709
He was no accomplice.
He was a mere pawn

532
01:20:24,914 --> 01:20:28,372
I have no accomplices.
Only hired hands...

533
01:20:29,252 --> 01:20:31,880
...who die if they prove
a threat to me

534
01:20:37,260 --> 01:20:42,562
- Me included?
- You're as dear as my own life

535
01:20:43,933 --> 01:20:48,393
Shekhar recognised you.
That's why I had him framed

536
01:20:49,772 --> 01:20:53,572
- All is fair in love and war
- False promises, too?

537
01:20:54,010 --> 01:20:56,240
Promises?
- You've forgotten

538
01:20:57,113 --> 01:21:00,571
Did you take me from the
orphanage to lead this life?

539
01:21:02,952 --> 01:21:07,912
At times, I hate myself.
I want to die or run away

540
01:21:11,627 --> 01:21:13,754
Why did Shekhar do such a thing?

541
01:21:14,297 --> 01:21:16,265
Father, do you believe...

542
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:22,601
Shekhar's guilty?

543
01:21:23,139 --> 01:21:27,599
Believing is useless.
The evidence is clear

544
01:21:27,810 --> 01:21:29,778
He can't do as he pleases

545
01:21:29,979 --> 01:21:33,107
To find the truth...
he can't kill

546
01:21:33,649 --> 01:21:34,946
Now what?

547
01:21:35,251 --> 01:21:36,946
Let's see what happens.

548
01:21:37,153 --> 01:21:43,114
He can't take the law into his hands.

549
01:21:43,659 --> 01:21:46,457
The court may be severe

550
01:21:47,163 --> 01:21:49,461
3 years, 5 years, who knows?

551
01:21:58,674 --> 01:22:03,134
You're crying for Shekhar?

552
01:22:03,846 --> 01:22:08,146
Save him, father.
He's innocent

553
01:22:08,684 --> 01:22:12,484
My heart knows it

554
01:22:14,023 --> 01:22:19,154
I am afraid that justice
requires truthful evidence

555
01:22:19,862 --> 01:22:21,830
Hearts cannot testify

556
01:22:47,390 --> 01:22:51,190
As I was saying, at 9.15 Shekhar
summoned the prisoners...

557
01:22:51,327 --> 01:22:53,352
for interrogation

558
01:22:54,564 --> 01:22:57,533
At 12.15 the prisoner
was sent back to his cell

559
01:22:58,067 --> 01:23:00,365
At 12.20 he was found dead

560
01:23:02,071 --> 01:23:04,198
This is the coroner's report

561
01:23:05,074 --> 01:23:09,704
It says that the prisoner died
as a result of brutal assault

562
01:23:10,746 --> 01:23:13,715
This assault took place
while Shekhar was with...

563
01:23:14,417 --> 01:23:16,044
the prisoner

564
01:23:16,252 --> 01:23:19,551
According to the law,
he's responsible

565
01:23:21,090 --> 01:23:26,221
Not only is Shekhar responsible
for the death...

566
01:23:26,762 --> 01:23:28,059
but he killed him

567
01:23:28,431 --> 01:23:32,390
I would like to call a witness
- Permission granted.

568
01:23:32,768 --> 01:23:34,895
First witness, Constable Rashid

569
01:23:45,114 --> 01:23:49,744
Repeat after me

570
01:23:56,125 --> 01:24:00,585
- Where were you that night?
- On duty, Sir

571
01:24:01,297 --> 01:24:07,258
At 9.15, when the prisoner
was called from his cell...

572
01:24:07,803 --> 01:24:10,431
...what was his condition?
- He was fine

573
01:24:10,806 --> 01:24:13,434
Was he well when he returned?

574
01:24:14,310 --> 01:24:18,770
No, Sir. He could hardly walk.
He needed help

575
01:24:19,148 --> 01:24:22,447
- How was he then?
- He was crying and groaning

576
01:24:27,156 --> 01:24:30,455
- What time did he return?
- About 12.15

577
01:24:31,494 --> 01:24:34,622
He was out of his cell
for 3 hours

578
01:24:35,998 --> 01:24:38,296
- Where was he?
- In the charge room

579
01:24:39,168 --> 01:24:41,966
- Who was he with?
- Inspector Shekhar

580
01:24:42,738 --> 01:24:49,803
It is clear the prisoner
left his cell in good health

581
01:24:50,846 --> 01:24:54,805
He then spent 3 hours alone
with Inspector Shekhar...

582
01:24:55,184 --> 01:24:59,985
...after which time the
prisoner could barely walk

583
01:25:02,191 --> 01:25:05,319
Your witness
- Any questions?

584
01:25:07,530 --> 01:25:09,498
No, Sir.

585
01:25:15,538 --> 01:25:17,506
- Where were you?
- Outside the charge room

586
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:22,170
- When did you enter?
- Half an hour later

587
01:25:22,878 --> 01:25:26,006
- How did you find the prisoner?
- He was upset

588
01:25:27,216 --> 01:25:29,844
Just upset? Then what did you do?

589
01:25:30,386 --> 01:25:36,689
- I helped him back to his cell
- So he needed help?

590
01:25:38,227 --> 01:25:40,024
Why did he need help?

591
01:25:40,229 --> 01:25:44,689
He was trembling and unsteady.
He could hardly walk, Sir

592
01:25:50,239 --> 01:25:52,207
Any questions?

593
01:25:53,576 --> 01:25:55,544
No, Sir

594
01:26:01,083 --> 01:26:05,213
Where were you between
9.15 and 12.15...

595
01:26:05,588 --> 01:26:09,888
...when the prisoner was alone
with Inspector Shekhar?

596
01:26:10,092 --> 01:26:11,389
In the office

597
01:26:11,594 --> 01:26:14,722
- Did you hear anything?
- Cries, Sir

598
01:26:15,097 --> 01:26:17,065
- What cries?
- All prisoners cry

599
01:26:17,266 --> 01:26:19,564
No opinions, please.
I asked you a question

600
01:26:20,936 --> 01:26:24,736
- I want to know what you heard
- Cries, Sir

601
01:26:24,940 --> 01:26:26,908
- Beating?
- No, Sir

602
01:26:27,610 --> 01:26:30,909
- What was it?
- He shouted "let me go"

603
01:26:31,714 --> 01:26:35,081
- Could it imply beating?
- Not necessarily

604
01:26:35,785 --> 01:26:38,413
- But it's possible?
- Anything is possible

605
01:26:40,122 --> 01:26:45,583
The prisoner shouted during
3 hours to be left alone

606
01:26:47,129 --> 01:26:49,427
- Is that right?
- Yes, Sir

607
01:26:52,768 --> 01:26:56,101
Have you anything to say?
- No, Sir

608
01:27:02,978 --> 01:27:07,779
- What time did you enter the cell?
- At 10 p.m.

609
01:27:09,985 --> 01:27:13,785
- Was the cell occupied?
- No, Sir

610
01:27:14,323 --> 01:27:16,621
A prisoner was brought in
half an hour later

611
01:27:17,993 --> 01:27:20,962
- When did Shersingh enter?
- Shersingh?

612
01:27:22,331 --> 01:27:26,961
- The man who died that night
- You mean him?

613
01:27:28,003 --> 01:27:33,464
After midnight, I clearly remember
I heard the clock strike twelve

614
01:27:34,677 --> 01:27:37,976
What state was he in,
when he entered the cell?

615
01:27:38,848 --> 01:27:44,480
He was shaking. He collapsed
at once and never got up again

616
01:27:50,860 --> 01:27:52,327
Did he say anything?

617
01:27:53,863 --> 01:27:56,991
He said "that Inspector..."

618
01:28:00,369 --> 01:28:03,668
- Were those his last words?
- Yes

619
01:28:08,544 --> 01:28:10,512
Any questions, Inspector Shekhar?

620
01:28:12,381 --> 01:28:14,349
One question

621
01:28:19,221 --> 01:28:22,019
- What work do you do?
- I process liquids

622
01:28:22,391 --> 01:28:23,358
What kinds?

623
01:28:23,492 --> 01:28:28,361
- Aniseed and roses
- And grapes? I mean wine

624
01:28:29,064 --> 01:28:33,364
You've been jailed thrice

625
01:28:46,415 --> 01:28:49,384
What time were you locked up?

626
01:28:50,586 --> 01:28:54,044
- At about 10.30
- Was anyone else in the cell?

627
01:28:54,256 --> 01:28:56,224
There was another man

628
01:28:56,759 --> 01:29:02,061
Did you hear any cries
between 10.30 and 12.15?

629
01:29:03,599 --> 01:29:08,730
- What did you think they were?
- A prisoner being beaten up

630
01:29:09,939 --> 01:29:14,239
What was Shersingh's condition
when he entered the cell?

631
01:29:14,443 --> 01:29:18,573
He was in a bad state, Sir.
Then we saw him dead

632
01:29:23,519 --> 01:29:28,081
Any questions?
- Yes.

633
01:29:33,295 --> 01:29:35,263
How many times were you in jail?

634
01:29:37,633 --> 01:29:38,930
Thrice

635
01:29:39,068 --> 01:29:41,935
- What was the first charge?
- Theft

636
01:29:42,638 --> 01:29:45,436
- The second charge?
- Rioting

637
01:29:50,646 --> 01:29:53,945
- What was the third charge?
- Robbery

638
01:29:54,650 --> 01:30:00,111
Bravo! With such a record,
only murder was left

639
01:30:02,324 --> 01:30:06,784
The accused is discrediting the
witness to prove his innocence

640
01:30:08,497 --> 01:30:13,628
I admit that Shersingh was
with me for 3 hours...

641
01:30:14,169 --> 01:30:20,130
As per the public prosecutor.
He will, however...

642
01:30:20,342 --> 01:30:23,470
...concede that he died 5
minutes after entering the cell

643
01:30:24,513 --> 01:30:29,644
May I ask, my lord, are 3 hours
required to kill a man?

644
01:30:31,353 --> 01:30:33,821
Couldn't 5 minutes suffice?

645
01:30:41,363 --> 01:30:44,662
Doctors say death can
result from a single blow

646
01:30:46,201 --> 01:30:50,001
A blow can be delivered in
3 hours or in 5 minutes

647
01:30:51,206 --> 01:30:53,674
I'd like to conclude...

648
01:30:54,543 --> 01:30:59,674
On one hand, you have heard
the testimony of known criminals

649
01:31:00,549 --> 01:31:06,681
On the other, stands one who has
served the police for 10 years

650
01:31:17,566 --> 01:31:20,694
The defendant has
introduced a new point

651
01:31:21,236 --> 01:31:26,196
I concede the murder could've
taken place in a few instants

652
01:31:26,742 --> 01:31:31,873
The question is, who would
benefit by it?

653
01:31:32,748 --> 01:31:37,378
Shekhar! If he had succeeded
in getting a confession...

654
01:31:37,753 --> 01:31:41,883
he might have got a medal

655
01:31:42,925 --> 01:31:46,224
Can Shekhar tell us how the
witnesses would benefit?

656
01:31:49,765 --> 01:31:53,895
Money. The man who had
Srivastav killed...

657
01:31:54,603 --> 01:31:57,731
...could hire killers
to remove a witness

658
01:31:58,273 --> 01:32:01,902
So his crimes would stay a secret

659
01:32:02,611 --> 01:32:04,909
What secret? Who is this man?

660
01:32:05,614 --> 01:32:08,583
A man who tried bribing me,
with 50,000 rupees

661
01:32:09,952 --> 01:32:14,912
Can you tell us who he is,
and where he lives?

662
01:32:19,128 --> 01:32:22,586
I don't know yet.
But I assure you, my lord...

663
01:32:23,298 --> 01:32:25,596
...given time,
I'll find out

664
01:32:26,635 --> 01:32:31,766
This 'man' is a figment
of Shekhar's imagination

665
01:32:32,641 --> 01:32:36,099
Shekhar is trying, by any means,
to prove himself innocent

666
01:32:38,180 --> 01:32:40,148
I pray the court...

667
01:32:40,315 --> 01:32:45,947
...to punish Shekhar severely
as a lesson to him and...

668
01:32:47,056 --> 01:32:48,956
a warning to all

669
01:32:49,224 --> 01:32:52,955
The role of the police is to
protect people, not to kill them

670
01:32:57,332 --> 01:32:59,300
The case will be decided tomorrow

671
01:33:20,022 --> 01:33:23,981
When did you come?
- A while ago

672
01:33:28,697 --> 01:33:30,665
A nice place

673
01:33:33,535 --> 01:33:35,833
Does your parrot talk?

674
01:33:40,876 --> 01:33:45,006
He wakes me up in the morning
and scolds me if I'm late

675
01:33:48,217 --> 01:33:49,514
Why the visit?

676
01:33:51,887 --> 01:33:53,855
Your father will be furious

677
01:33:55,057 --> 01:33:59,687
I know. But I didn't want
you to be alone

678
01:34:01,396 --> 01:34:04,194
- Tomorrow, they decide the case
- I know their decision

679
01:34:05,734 --> 01:34:12,537
I'll be imprisoned.
And you'll visit me there

680
01:34:21,917 --> 01:34:25,876
Take the case to
the High court

681
01:34:26,755 --> 01:34:30,213
It won't make much
difference

682
01:34:30,425 --> 01:34:34,555
- Why not? You're innocent
- I can't prove it

683
01:34:37,599 --> 01:34:41,729
We can't meet any longer.

684
01:34:42,938 --> 01:34:46,237
You're a police officer's daughter
I'm a criminal

685
01:34:48,177 --> 01:34:50,577
People will despise
my very name

686
01:34:52,447 --> 01:34:56,406
Forget you ever met me...

687
01:34:57,786 --> 01:34:59,913
even in your dreams

688
01:35:00,455 --> 01:35:03,424
How can I ever forget you?

689
01:35:06,295 --> 01:35:10,925
When we first met, you took
me for a thief

690
01:35:12,634 --> 01:35:16,434
Consider that I was never
a police officer

691
01:35:17,806 --> 01:35:20,104
You had met a murderer

692
01:35:55,677 --> 01:35:58,646
- You are beyond compare!
- What is it?

693
01:35:59,014 --> 01:36:01,312
Rekha told me everything

694
01:36:02,017 --> 01:36:05,976
You'll be imprisoned even though
you're innocent? Nonsense!

695
01:36:06,188 --> 01:36:09,316
- It's beyond you
- It's beyond 'you'

696
01:36:09,524 --> 01:36:13,324
These people are no small
fry like me

697
01:36:13,528 --> 01:36:16,827
They've cut the noose you had
planned for them

698
01:36:24,039 --> 01:36:27,497
- You're right
- You can't go in the lock-up

699
01:36:28,043 --> 01:36:32,503
- Don't go to court
- And the man who stood bail?

700
01:36:32,881 --> 01:36:36,681
- We'll deal with him later
- You're mad

701
01:36:42,557 --> 01:36:44,684
Maybe. But at least hear me out

702
01:36:45,060 --> 01:36:48,518
If you go to jail, the real
culprits will go scot-free

703
01:36:52,801 --> 01:36:58,205
The people who killed the
editor and the witness...

704
01:36:58,573 --> 01:37:01,542
...who framed you,
can do even more

705
01:37:02,077 --> 01:37:04,375
They can kill again

706
01:37:04,913 --> 01:37:08,212
What are you saying?
Who are 'they'?

707
01:37:08,684 --> 01:37:12,211
'They' are the same people
who took me to a strange house

708
01:37:12,921 --> 01:37:17,051
There, I saw a beautiful woman

709
01:37:19,261 --> 01:37:22,890
That house is linked
with the whole story

710
01:37:23,298 --> 01:37:24,890
- Where is it?
- In Bombay

711
01:37:25,100 --> 01:37:27,398
Where?
- Don't know.

712
01:37:27,769 --> 01:37:30,397
They took me in a car
with tinted windows

713
01:37:30,772 --> 01:37:32,399
It was all hush-hush

714
01:37:32,541 --> 01:37:37,569
- What did they want?
- Well, I'd seen the killer

715
01:37:37,946 --> 01:37:40,414
They said, if I testified,
I'd be in for it

716
01:37:40,949 --> 01:37:46,080
That's it! You've got to
find that house and them

717
01:37:46,288 --> 01:37:50,418
Who'll catch the killers?
Who will prove you're innocent?

718
01:37:50,959 --> 01:37:53,587
You must run away

719
01:38:38,006 --> 01:38:42,466
Inspector Shekhar's escaped.
He's messed up my plans

720
01:38:44,846 --> 01:38:46,814
I tried hard to frame him

721
01:38:48,350 --> 01:38:50,318
What do we do?

722
01:38:54,189 --> 01:38:58,649
- Help the police to find him
- Help the police?

723
01:38:59,027 --> 01:39:02,656
Until he's been caught,
we're in trouble

724
01:39:04,533 --> 01:39:10,494
Be careful. He's bound to
come looking for you

725
01:39:18,046 --> 01:39:22,506
Find him! Post men at the
airport, the railway stations

726
01:39:23,051 --> 01:39:25,679
Set up road blocks!

727
01:39:26,388 --> 01:39:30,017
Search every ship in port!
Shekhar must be found

728
01:39:30,725 --> 01:39:32,693
Dead or alive

729
01:39:36,898 --> 01:39:41,358
What is it?
- Nothing

730
01:39:42,070 --> 01:39:44,197
Tears?

731
01:39:46,741 --> 01:39:50,871
I can't help it
- Stop crying at once!

732
01:39:51,746 --> 01:39:53,873
It's useless.

733
01:39:54,416 --> 01:39:57,715
He's in trouble, father.
He needs help

734
01:39:58,086 --> 01:40:02,045
He must be arrested!
- He's innocent

735
01:40:02,491 --> 01:40:03,890
This is what your heart says?

736
01:40:12,934 --> 01:40:14,902
Stop this nonsense!

737
01:40:21,443 --> 01:40:26,403
He'll be caught and jailed.
There's little else for him

738
01:40:46,134 --> 01:40:50,434
"Enchanted by a first love,
eyes filled with sweet dreams"

739
01:40:50,805 --> 01:40:54,935
"From the realm of magic,
appeared a magician"

740
01:41:15,330 --> 01:41:19,130
"What kind of spell
did he cast on me?"

741
01:41:19,834 --> 01:41:23,964
"The magician has vanished,
leaving me lost and lonely"

742
01:41:40,355 --> 01:41:44,485
"With a single glance,
he stole away my peace of mind"

743
01:42:08,883 --> 01:42:13,183
"O stars above, you must have
seen him leave"

744
01:42:13,722 --> 01:42:17,852
"With your light, help me to
seek him out"

745
01:42:33,908 --> 01:42:38,208
"Distressed and alone,
I wander in search of my love"

746
01:43:02,771 --> 01:43:06,730
"Since the day I fell
in love with you"

747
01:43:07,442 --> 01:43:11,401
"The long nights pass,
filled with such sorrow"

748
01:43:27,629 --> 01:43:31,759
"Come home to me again,
and fill my world with joy"

749
01:43:36,638 --> 01:43:40,938
"Enchanted by a first love,
eyes filled with sweet dreams"

750
01:43:41,309 --> 01:43:45,439
"From the realm of magic,
appeared a magician"

751
01:44:51,946 --> 01:44:55,404
Be careful!
He could be anywhere

752
01:47:28,770 --> 01:47:30,397
- Did you see anyone?
- No, Sir

753
01:48:42,677 --> 01:48:44,645
You? What are you doing here?

754
01:48:46,848 --> 01:48:49,476
And you?
- I live here

755
01:48:50,852 --> 01:48:52,820
My destination!
So this is your house

756
01:48:53,521 --> 01:48:57,821
Strange coincidence.
I tried so hard to find it

757
01:48:59,027 --> 01:49:00,995
Then, I stumble on
the house accidentally

758
01:49:07,869 --> 01:49:11,168
Do you know that I can get
rid of you in a flash?

759
01:49:11,706 --> 01:49:15,506
All you have to do is to
pull the trigger...

760
01:49:15,643 --> 01:49:20,671
and I'll join Srivastav

761
01:49:22,884 --> 01:49:24,852
But you won't do that

762
01:49:26,387 --> 01:49:30,187
You're going to tell me who
is behind Srivastav's murder

763
01:49:30,892 --> 01:49:32,860
Don't move or I'll shoot!

764
01:49:34,562 --> 01:49:38,521
You can engineer a crime,
but you can't murder anyone

765
01:49:40,902 --> 01:49:44,201
You can bribe,
but you can't kill

766
01:49:59,754 --> 01:50:01,722
How did you get hurt?

767
01:50:02,757 --> 01:50:06,557
A gun was fired at
your command

768
01:50:12,934 --> 01:50:15,232
You're shaking

769
01:50:17,438 --> 01:50:21,568
There's perspiration
on your forehead

770
01:50:24,946 --> 01:50:28,074
Go on, shoot!

771
01:50:39,961 --> 01:50:42,429
- Where am I?
- Don't worry. You're safe

772
01:50:46,467 --> 01:50:48,435
- Have I been here long?
- A day

773
01:50:50,972 --> 01:50:54,772
Have I been unconscious
for all this time?

774
01:50:55,977 --> 01:51:00,107
You've dressed my wound?

775
01:51:00,648 --> 01:51:04,448
What else was I to do?
Hand you over to the police?

776
01:51:05,987 --> 01:51:09,946
Why the police? You could've
handed me over to your friends

777
01:51:14,328 --> 01:51:17,126
If they can pay 50.000
for a mute parrot...

778
01:51:18,166 --> 01:51:21,135
...they might offer
200.000 for me

779
01:51:24,839 --> 01:51:28,468
What use is money?
- It has many uses

780
01:51:29,010 --> 01:51:34,642
A fancy car, a diamond necklace.
You missed a golden chance

781
01:51:36,184 --> 01:51:38,152
It doesn't matter

782
01:51:39,687 --> 01:51:44,488
How do you feel now?
- Good. I can walk

783
01:51:44,859 --> 01:51:47,657
You must leave right away.
You're in danger

784
01:51:48,696 --> 01:51:53,156
- Danger?
- Yes, your life's at stake

785
01:51:54,202 --> 01:51:56,170
Why does it upset you?
It's my life

786
01:51:57,872 --> 01:52:02,332
I won't leave here
empty-handed

787
01:52:03,711 --> 01:52:08,341
The evidence and proof
of my innocence lie here

788
01:52:10,051 --> 01:52:12,519
I'll leave when I have them

789
01:52:26,067 --> 01:52:28,035
He's here!
- Who?

790
01:52:28,736 --> 01:52:30,704
Never mind. You must go

791
01:52:31,405 --> 01:52:34,203
Who is he?

792
01:52:35,243 --> 01:52:37,711
He's waiting in the car.
- Let him.

793
01:52:38,412 --> 01:52:42,212
He's dangerous!
He'll kill us both

794
01:52:43,751 --> 01:52:47,710
So he's the murderer?
Come.

795
01:52:48,256 --> 01:52:53,216
Don't go there, I implore you.
I'll deal with him.

796
01:53:51,819 --> 01:53:55,619
"Though you aim at the target
your arrow pierces another"

797
01:54:00,494 --> 01:54:04,794
"O heartless one, let me live.
Why make life such a bother"

798
01:54:31,692 --> 01:54:35,822
"No one can ever guess
what your intentions are"

799
01:54:40,534 --> 01:54:44,493
"Don't come any closer,
your looks kill me from afar"

800
01:54:49,710 --> 01:54:53,840
"Save me, oh save me.
Save this fragile heart"

801
01:55:20,408 --> 01:55:24,538
"You throw me a glance,
almost helter-skelter"

802
01:55:29,250 --> 01:55:33,380
"Those who value their lives
had better find a new shelter"

803
01:55:38,359 --> 01:55:42,386
"Your ways are cruel,
yet they are dear to me"

804
01:56:09,123 --> 01:56:12,923
"You inflict such pain,
where can I hide, where can I go"

805
01:56:17,631 --> 01:56:21,761
"Only you can save me from
such sorrow"

806
01:56:26,640 --> 01:56:30,940
"You hold the key,
the world is at your command"

807
01:56:57,338 --> 01:57:01,297
"The hunter nears,
the hunted must fly to safety"

808
01:57:06,547 --> 01:57:10,142
"The snare is made of tresses,
you can escape me"

809
01:57:15,289 --> 01:57:18,986
"Speed away,
the hunter is near"

810
01:59:26,893 --> 01:59:29,361
- Is he the murderer?
- Yes

811
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:43,268
- I know a way we can escape
- How?

812
02:00:44,804 --> 02:00:46,772
That way.

813
02:02:49,328 --> 02:02:51,296
Go! Don't waste time

814
02:02:52,431 --> 02:02:56,390
Shoot them! Run them over!

815
02:02:58,604 --> 02:03:02,904
Shekhar and Kamini mustn't
reach the police station alive

816
02:03:38,811 --> 02:03:41,109
Inspector Jagdish?
This is Shekhar

817
02:03:42,648 --> 02:03:44,275
I'll give myself up

818
02:03:46,819 --> 02:03:48,787
Stop the car!

819
02:05:21,080 --> 02:05:24,538
- What can we do now?
- Drive to the police station

820
02:05:25,751 --> 02:05:29,881
They'll be heading there.
We'll be waiting

821
02:06:09,628 --> 02:06:11,596
There it is. Shall I stop?

822
02:06:12,298 --> 02:06:14,266
What if they don't arrive?

823
02:06:16,135 --> 02:06:19,263
Pull in.
Keep the motor running

824
02:06:37,656 --> 02:06:40,625
- Are you sure it was Shekhar?
- I spoke to him myself

825
02:06:47,333 --> 02:06:52,293
- Why did he call?
- He wants to give himself up

826
02:06:56,675 --> 02:06:58,802
The line got cut off

827
02:07:02,848 --> 02:07:04,816
Here they are

828
02:07:15,694 --> 02:07:18,162
Follow that car!

829
02:07:20,733 --> 02:07:23,327
Who is she? Who fired?

830
02:07:28,540 --> 02:07:34,672
The man who had Srivastav killed
and Shersingh murdered

831
02:07:35,047 --> 02:07:40,007
Nonsense!
- It's true

832
02:07:40,519 --> 02:07:44,512
Arrest him!
- I won't run

833
02:07:45,057 --> 02:07:49,357
- You ran once before
- I can prove I'm innocent

834
02:07:50,062 --> 02:07:52,690
I know who killed Srivastav
- Who?

835
02:07:54,066 --> 02:07:55,363
Dharamdas

836
02:07:58,070 --> 02:08:01,369
You must be crazy!

837
02:08:03,976 --> 02:08:05,375
Any proof?

838
02:08:08,747 --> 02:08:10,715
When she comes around,
she'll talk

839
02:08:41,780 --> 02:08:46,740
If she doesn't survive,
you'll be in trouble

840
02:08:51,957 --> 02:08:53,925
You can't run away again

841
02:08:58,130 --> 02:09:00,598
- How is she, doctor?
- Still unconscious

842
02:09:01,467 --> 02:09:05,096
- She's very ill
- I need her evidence

843
02:09:07,306 --> 02:09:09,274
Her life is more
precious than that

844
02:09:11,143 --> 02:09:14,271
- What do you mean?
- She may not survive

845
02:09:15,147 --> 02:09:17,115
We're doing our best

846
02:09:45,844 --> 02:09:50,474
I've got an idea. Let's tell
the press that she's well...

847
02:09:53,018 --> 02:09:54,986
and she will testify

848
02:10:10,202 --> 02:10:15,333
We're finished!
Kamini is recovering

849
02:10:16,708 --> 02:10:18,835
She has agreed to testify

850
02:10:21,547 --> 02:10:23,515
She won't regain
consciousness

851
02:10:24,383 --> 02:10:27,181
Go to the hospital!

852
02:10:34,226 --> 02:10:36,194
You're quiet?

853
02:10:42,234 --> 02:10:48,867
Do the job and then you
can name your price

854
02:10:53,579 --> 02:10:55,547
You're scared?

855
02:10:56,915 --> 02:11:00,874
If you're caught, you'll be
inside for awhile, that's all

856
02:11:02,087 --> 02:11:06,217
A man can lose his life
in the lock-up these days

857
02:11:09,428 --> 02:11:14,889
Cowards! Scoundrels!

858
02:11:35,120 --> 02:11:40,251
- Are the arrangements made?
- She'll be moved to Room 15

859
02:12:03,982 --> 02:12:06,610
We'll be in 13

860
02:12:11,990 --> 02:12:15,790
It's 8 a.m. The deadline
is 8 p.m.

861
02:12:39,518 --> 02:12:44,148
I knew they wouldn't
dare to come here

862
02:12:44,856 --> 02:12:49,987
So the murderer is a
figment of your imagination

863
02:13:22,394 --> 02:13:24,362
Miss Kamini

864
02:13:35,741 --> 02:13:37,868
Room no. 13
Second floor

865
02:14:09,775 --> 02:14:14,576
We can't spend the rest
of our lives here

866
02:14:32,631 --> 02:14:36,089
A man asked for Kamini
- What no. Did you tell him?

867
02:14:39,638 --> 02:14:41,606
He's on his way up

868
02:17:12,290 --> 02:17:14,258
Room 15.

869
02:18:44,549 --> 02:18:47,347
Well done! We would never
have solved the case alone

870
02:18:48,053 --> 02:18:51,181
Escaping was an offence

871
02:18:52,290 --> 02:18:57,023
You'll be punished.
But I'll recommend your release

872
02:19:23,588 --> 02:19:27,547
Inspector, I want to testify
