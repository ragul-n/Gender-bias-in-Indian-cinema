Subtitles from Arylah

2
00:01:35,233 --> 00:01:36,177
Thanks, Dad.

3
00:01:36,233 --> 00:01:37,211
Thanks for coming.

4
00:01:37,267 --> 00:01:39,508
Hey, it's my pleasure.

5
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,206
It's a beautiful place.

6
00:01:41,867 --> 00:01:43,369
Looks more beautiful in the rains.

7
00:01:43,933 --> 00:01:45,503
It rains all the time.

8
00:01:46,267 --> 00:01:47,974
By the way,
how did you find this place?

9
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,012
It took me 6 hours
to get here from Delhi.

10
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,904
This place is not that famous.

11
00:01:53,067 --> 00:01:54,205
Yet, I found it.

12
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:55,539
You know I'm talented.

13
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,444
That you are.

14
00:01:59,467 --> 00:02:01,447
And it's right in
the middle of the jungle.

15
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,608
Amazing.

16
00:02:03,267 --> 00:02:05,406
Yeah, dad.
That's the specialty of this place.

17
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,006
Middle of the forest.

18
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,246
Glendale Forest Hotel.

19
00:02:10,233 --> 00:02:11,143
It's beautiful.

20
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:12,607
It's a Boutique Hotel, dad.

21
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:14,204
Meaning?

22
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:17,013
Meaning it's not
like the regular hotels.

23
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,280
Lesser number of rooms,
but every room is unique.

24
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,978
And less staff,
for personal attention.

25
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,336
This is going to be my reception.

26
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:25,811
Reception!

27
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:31,013
Very good flooring. - Yes.

28
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,045
Nice.

29
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:34,540
I'm going to make
this into my dining room.

30
00:02:35,533 --> 00:02:37,069
And you did all this by yourself?

31
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:38,841
Without any help.

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,842
Yeah.

33
00:02:40,533 --> 00:02:42,035
I'm so proud of you.

34
00:02:45,367 --> 00:02:46,004
Come.

35
00:02:46,067 --> 00:02:46,545
WOW!

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,276
The guest rooms are this way.
- Nice.

37
00:02:49,533 --> 00:02:51,570
And I will design
every guestroom myself.

38
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,576
I had no clue you were
an interior designer too.

39
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,608
You know me, dad.

40
00:03:05,267 --> 00:03:05,972
Dad!

41
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:26,141
Hello.

42
00:03:26,267 --> 00:03:28,406
Contractor Fateh Singh
speaking from Chandigarh.

43
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,871
Fateh Singh, when will the
Christmas decorations be here?

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,842
Sorry, madam.

45
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,573
It took me really long
to arrange all the stuff.

46
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,809
The vehicles have
just left for your hotel.

47
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,411
It will be there by morning latest.

48
00:03:38,933 --> 00:03:40,207
You can check it thoroughly.

49
00:03:40,433 --> 00:03:41,411
Thank you and sorry.

50
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:42,838
Okay.

51
00:03:46,533 --> 00:03:49,241
Ganesh. Where are you?

52
00:03:50,467 --> 00:03:52,071
How much longer will it take?

53
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:57,245
First of all I'm in
the middle of a jungle.

54
00:03:57,933 --> 00:04:00,038
And secondly,
the contractor's been calling me.

55
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:04,281
We need to deliver the
goods at Glendale hotel by dawn.

56
00:04:05,233 --> 00:04:06,303
Okay, fine, fine.

57
00:04:06,367 --> 00:04:07,937
Hurry up. HUFFY UP-

58
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,204
Who's there?

59
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,904
Who's there?

60
00:04:49,867 --> 00:04:51,346
Who's there?

61
00:07:26,133 --> 00:07:26,873
Higher.

62
00:07:27,133 --> 00:07:27,873
Higher.

63
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,478
Careful.

64
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,442
Is this right madam?

65
00:07:31,533 --> 00:07:32,307
Higher.

66
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,271
Yes.

67
00:07:33,433 --> 00:07:34,411
Ma'am. - Yeah.

68
00:07:34,467 --> 00:07:35,969
MrRawat is waiting for you.

69
00:07:36,233 --> 00:07:37,837
You go. I am coming. - Yes, ma'am.

70
00:07:37,933 --> 00:07:39,412
Will you set it in place?
- Yes, ma'am.

71
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,470
Hi, Mr. Rawat.

72
00:07:41,533 --> 00:07:42,841
Hello. Hello. Hello.

73
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,436
Hi, so sweet of you to come.

74
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,535
My pleasure, ma'am.

75
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:48,243
From everyone at the
Indian Global Bank, for you.

76
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,278
Thank you so much.

77
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:51,836
And there's one more thing. This.

78
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,846
It's so sweet of you, thank you.

79
00:07:55,567 --> 00:07:57,205
Ma'am, this is your first hotel.

80
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,246
We at the bank wish that.

81
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,281
...soon you open a chain
of hotels under the same name.

82
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,277
Thank you so much.

83
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:07,543
And think of only
our bank for investments.

84
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,571
Of course.

85
00:08:08,933 --> 00:08:10,469
Knock on wood.. Hope it all happens.

86
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:11,375
Yes, ma'am.

87
00:08:11,433 --> 00:08:14,539
Oh wow, is that real?
- No, that's not.

88
00:08:14,867 --> 00:08:16,540
But we can organize
a safari for you'll.

89
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,012
WOW!

90
00:08:19,267 --> 00:08:21,838
Can you imagine we were
in the same school, same class.

91
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,470
...sitting two benches
apart from each other.

92
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,807
Still we never spoke
with each other.

93
00:08:26,467 --> 00:08:27,468
Went to the same college.

94
00:08:27,533 --> 00:08:30,013
...we even had common friends,
yet we never spoke.

95
00:08:30,167 --> 00:08:31,202
That's really sweet.

96
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,038
Finally, I think we spoke at
Regal Cinema, near Connaught Place.

97
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,008
When I had two tickets.

98
00:08:37,067 --> 00:08:39,172
...and my friend ditched
me at the last moment.

99
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,313
So we saw the film,
went for a coffee.

100
00:08:41,367 --> 00:08:42,607
...and then decided to have dinner.

101
00:08:42,867 --> 00:08:44,540
And three weeks
later we were engaged.

102
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:46,210
Three days back.. marriage.

103
00:08:46,267 --> 00:08:46,938
WOW!

104
00:08:47,567 --> 00:08:49,205
This is our honeymoon suite.

105
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:52,545
Wow! So pretty.

106
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,943
The best for you.

107
00:08:54,933 --> 00:08:56,037
So sad.

108
00:08:57,033 --> 00:08:57,511
Why?

109
00:08:57,967 --> 00:08:59,173
Because I'm going to
keep the curtains closed.

110
00:09:01,367 --> 00:09:02,471
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

111
00:09:03,133 --> 00:09:04,009
What's the problem?

112
00:09:05,033 --> 00:09:07,604
Ma'am, I am trying my best,
but I can't fix this oven here.

113
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,107
He didn't fit it properly
in the first place, ma'am..

114
00:09:09,167 --> 00:09:10,271
...how do you expect it to work?

115
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:11,471
I've been telling him from Day1.

116
00:09:11,533 --> 00:09:13,171
So why don't you fix it.

117
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,037
Madam, with your permission
can I take it to the company?

118
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,977
Your company will
take 10 days to fix this.

119
00:09:18,033 --> 00:09:19,376
And the party's today, idiot.

120
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,571
Madam, tell him
to behave otherwise.

121
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,175
Otherwise?

122
00:09:22,233 --> 00:09:24,076
Relax, guys.
We don't want fight here.

123
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,871
You go, I'll call the company.

124
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:27,536
Go on.

125
00:09:29,967 --> 00:09:30,877
Rajender.

126
00:09:31,067 --> 00:09:33,206
What will we do if
the oven isn't fixed?

127
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,810
Ma'am, I can make
a cake without the oven.

128
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,043
But it'll be a sponge-cake.

129
00:09:39,233 --> 00:09:40,143
Please make it.

130
00:09:40,267 --> 00:09:41,541
I knew when I hired you..

131
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,504
...I'm hiring the
best chef in the world.

132
00:09:44,967 --> 00:09:46,002
What's this, Deep?

133
00:09:46,133 --> 00:09:47,510
Why are the curtains so short?

134
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:50,047
Ma'am, they took
measurements of room no. 10..

135
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,272
...and made curtains for this room.

136
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:52,937
They thought the measurements
for both the room would be same.

137
00:09:53,567 --> 00:09:54,307
God!

138
00:09:54,867 --> 00:09:55,345
Fine.

139
00:09:55,467 --> 00:09:56,172
Go to my room.

140
00:09:56,233 --> 00:09:57,473
Get the curtains and fix those here.

141
00:09:57,533 --> 00:09:58,204
Okay. - Go.

142
00:09:58,367 --> 00:09:58,936
You too.

143
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:04,869
Ma'am.

144
00:10:05,067 --> 00:10:07,741
Yes. - Ma'am, that contractor
from Chandigarh called.

145
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,073
He was saying that the
truck's met with accident..

146
00:10:10,133 --> 00:10:11,874
...and he can't deliver
the goods on time either.

147
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,037
God!

148
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,107
Why is it all happening today?

149
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,410
Call up Mr. Gupta.

150
00:10:16,733 --> 00:10:18,041
Make all the arrangements
from right here.

151
00:10:18,167 --> 00:10:19,271
The guests must be on the way.

152
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:21,006
We can't cancel this
party at any cost.

153
00:10:21,067 --> 00:10:22,137
Yes, ma'am. - Go.

154
00:11:01,767 --> 00:11:02,609
So you're finally here.

155
00:11:13,033 --> 00:11:13,636
What?

156
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,006
I've been trying
to call you for 2 hours.

157
00:11:15,067 --> 00:11:15,841
Your phone's switched off.

158
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:16,742
That's not the way.

159
00:11:17,533 --> 00:11:19,035
And you're alone.

160
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,702
I am still alone.

161
00:11:22,967 --> 00:11:25,573
I mean.. your musicians,
band instruments?

162
00:11:26,067 --> 00:11:27,011
You're the singer, right?

163
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,808
Sort off.

164
00:11:34,167 --> 00:11:35,168
I can sing a bit.

165
00:11:35,733 --> 00:11:36,973
"Sing a bit?"

166
00:11:37,933 --> 00:11:39,606
It's my hotel's opening.

167
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:41,571
And it's a very special day for me.

168
00:11:41,933 --> 00:11:42,638
For me too.

169
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,905
I can already hear music in my ears.

170
00:11:46,633 --> 00:11:47,236
Okay.

171
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,179
If you want to rehearse,
the hall's that way.

172
00:11:57,733 --> 00:11:58,973
My papa used to say, that.

173
00:11:59,933 --> 00:12:02,038
...a home is not just
made of beautiful walls.

174
00:12:02,933 --> 00:12:04,742
...but also from the
people that live in it.

175
00:12:05,533 --> 00:12:07,638
Before today,
this place was in ruins.

176
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,971
But now you've made it lively again.

177
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,875
All of you turned this ruins
into a beautiful forest lodge.

178
00:12:16,033 --> 00:12:18,980
I would like to thank you
all for being my first guests.

179
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,910
...and I would like to
wish you guys Merry Christmas.

180
00:12:22,767 --> 00:12:24,212
And hope you have
a wonderful stay here.

181
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:37,777
"Just like heart needs heartbeats."

182
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:48,315
"One needs to breathe
for staying alive."

183
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:58,318
"Similarly.
the innocent heart needs."

184
00:12:58,533 --> 00:13:00,206
"A beloved."

185
00:13:00,933 --> 00:13:02,844
"A beloved."

186
00:13:03,567 --> 00:13:06,013
"A beloved."

187
00:13:06,067 --> 00:13:08,604
"A beloved."

188
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:11,079
"A beloved."

189
00:13:11,133 --> 00:13:12,942
"A beloved."

190
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,112
"A beloved."

191
00:13:16,167 --> 00:13:19,307
"A beloved."

192
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:23,971
Kevlin, get the
instruments quickly. - Yes.

193
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,543
Ma'am, actually we got
delayed in getting here.

194
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,840
It was raining really
heavily on the way?

195
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,537
But you are?

196
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,670
We're the orchestra people.

197
00:13:30,033 --> 00:13:31,603
If you're the orchestra, then..

198
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:32,236
Kevlin.

199
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:48,350
"Just like you need
words to start a jamboree."

200
00:13:49,533 --> 00:13:59,011
"The stars need the night,
not the dawn."

201
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:09,220
"Similarly.
the helpless heart needs."

202
00:14:09,267 --> 00:14:10,803
"A beloved."

203
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,743
"A beloved."

204
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,813
"A beloved."

205
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,276
"A beloved."

206
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,244
"A beloved."

207
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,877
"A beloved."

208
00:14:24,567 --> 00:14:27,013
"A beloved."

209
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:30,173
"A beloved."

210
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:55,872
"A sweetheart is someone
who brings happiness."

211
00:14:55,933 --> 00:15:00,507
"..like you've attained heaven."

212
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:03,573
"She's an ocean of serenity."

213
00:15:03,633 --> 00:15:05,704
"The only motive to live."

214
00:15:06,033 --> 00:15:09,981
"An embodiment of love."

215
00:15:10,033 --> 00:15:18,714
"That's why the lost hear-t needs."

216
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,641
"A beloved."

217
00:15:22,567 --> 00:15:24,478
"A beloved."

218
00:15:25,033 --> 00:15:27,604
"A beloved."

219
00:15:27,667 --> 00:15:30,045
"A beloved."

220
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,977
"A beloved."

221
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,611
"A beloved."

222
00:15:35,133 --> 00:15:37,704
"A beloved."

223
00:15:37,767 --> 00:15:40,509
"A beloved."

224
00:15:44,567 --> 00:15:45,841
Kunal Anand. Right?

225
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,606
Yeah, Kunal Anand.

226
00:15:49,133 --> 00:15:50,339
And I'm an idiot.

227
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:53,005
I know you're a little embarrassed.

228
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:54,710
Not little. Very!

229
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,404
Why didn't you tell me
that you're not a singer..

230
00:15:57,467 --> 00:15:58,571
..but a guest instead.

231
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,871
Look, I knew you
mistook me for a singer.

232
00:16:02,367 --> 00:16:05,371
But, I also knew that
your musicians were late..

233
00:16:05,733 --> 00:16:07,838
...and you're upset
about your party tonight.

234
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:12,474
So.. I kept mum for a while
only to bring a smile on your face.

235
00:16:12,533 --> 00:16:13,102
Thank you.

236
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,708
Come. Let me show you your room.

237
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:15,934
Come.

238
00:16:58,867 --> 00:17:00,471
Was this the only pan
of the body you could find?

239
00:17:01,667 --> 00:17:02,907
Will I take the rest of it home?

240
00:17:03,667 --> 00:17:05,374
I sent you whatever I could find.

241
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,838
Just tell me which animal did this?

242
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,679
So that we can make our report,
and send it to our superiors

243
00:17:10,767 --> 00:17:12,508
It's difficult to say that.

244
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:14,475
What do you mean?

245
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,877
I mean there is no leopard,
panther.

246
00:17:16,933 --> 00:17:19,140
...lion or cheetah
behind this attack.

247
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,302
Because they don't
have a jaw this big.

248
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,244
The difference between
the teethes on the side.

249
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,337
...is between 9-12 inches.

250
00:17:27,767 --> 00:17:29,872
But the distance
here is much bigger.

251
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,204
And, the force applied..

252
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,676
...to sever this part
from the body is much more.

253
00:17:42,733 --> 00:17:43,939
Come Rana.

254
00:17:49,133 --> 00:17:52,205
This doctor's either a big fool,
or he's too smart.

255
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,802
I suggest we shut
down both the cases.

256
00:17:55,667 --> 00:17:56,668
Right?

257
00:17:56,833 --> 00:18:00,303
And we'll mention some
lion or cheetah in the file.

258
00:18:00,767 --> 00:18:02,178
Sir, the doctor was saying.

259
00:18:02,233 --> 00:18:03,678
...it's not a lion or cheetah,
it's something else.

260
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:05,372
Something else?

261
00:18:06,633 --> 00:18:08,943
Do you have any name or
whereabouts of this "thing"?

262
00:18:09,633 --> 00:18:10,475
No, sir.

263
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:11,935
So what do you expect to do?

264
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,205
Do you want to wander
in the jungle..

265
00:18:13,267 --> 00:18:14,439
...and stick your head in his mouth?

266
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,840
Will you? - No, sir.

267
00:18:16,233 --> 00:18:16,711
Then?

268
00:18:16,867 --> 00:18:18,175
That's why I am telling you.

269
00:18:18,267 --> 00:18:19,211
Lift your pen and
jot down few lines.

270
00:18:19,267 --> 00:18:19,711
Close the case.

271
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:20,910
Come on.

272
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,475
I know he'll come back.

273
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,371
Humans can forget his past.

274
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,305
But he'll never forget it..

275
00:18:27,367 --> 00:18:28,744
...nor let anyone
else forget it either.

276
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:32,280
That thing lying inside
is just the first body.

277
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,708
There will be many more bodies.

278
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,505
I had warned you..

279
00:18:35,667 --> 00:18:37,237
..against cutting
down the Banyan tree!

280
00:18:37,467 --> 00:18:38,810
But no one heard me.

281
00:18:39,133 --> 00:18:40,635
But no one can stop him.

282
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,276
Only thing you'll hear
in the jungle now are screams.

283
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,443
Screams of innocent people.

284
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:47,509
Go away!

285
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,408
You will all repent it.

286
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,874
He won't listen to anyone.

287
00:18:51,933 --> 00:18:52,809
He will spare no one.

288
00:18:52,867 --> 00:18:53,743
Sir..

289
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,801
He'll spread chaos.
- Sir, what's he saying?

290
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:55,868
Pay heed to my words.
- It's nothing.

291
00:18:55,933 --> 00:18:56,707
He's uttering nonsense.

292
00:18:56,767 --> 00:18:57,745
Ignorant fool!

293
00:18:58,167 --> 00:19:00,374
Sir, what if an
innocent life is lost.

294
00:19:00,433 --> 00:19:01,741
...because we didn't take an action?

295
00:19:02,167 --> 00:19:05,148
Come on,
let's do something else, baby.

296
00:19:05,467 --> 00:19:06,707
Something more fun.

297
00:19:07,667 --> 00:19:08,737
Something more fun is okay..

298
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,609
..but, only if I
can understand this map.

299
00:19:10,867 --> 00:19:11,709
So there you guys are.

300
00:19:12,667 --> 00:19:14,237
Everything that
you need for a picnic.

301
00:19:14,667 --> 00:19:15,645
Thank you so much.

302
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,777
Now that you're here,
please help us out. - What?

303
00:19:17,867 --> 00:19:19,778
Can you please tell us which
is the best route for trekking.

304
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:21,642
...because this map
is very confusing.

305
00:19:22,633 --> 00:19:23,543
Okay, I'll help you.

306
00:19:23,933 --> 00:19:25,139
There are two treks here.

307
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,544
The longer route
leads to a waterfall.

308
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,807
And the shorter one
leads to a campfire site.

309
00:19:29,867 --> 00:19:31,778
And I think this one
is right for you guys.

310
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:35,575
Campfire, baby, please.

311
00:19:36,167 --> 00:19:37,646
Whatever you say, baby.

312
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:39,237
We're here for our honeymoon.

313
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,246
So we'll go on a
private picnic, right.

314
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,411
You're so cute..

315
00:19:43,467 --> 00:19:44,571
Okay, guys.

316
00:19:44,633 --> 00:19:45,577
Get a forest.

317
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,304
We shall. - Okay.

318
00:19:47,367 --> 00:19:47,868
Thank you. - Enjoy.

319
00:19:47,933 --> 00:19:49,173
Come, let's go. - Bye.

320
00:19:49,667 --> 00:19:50,702
Follow me.

321
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,872
Where to? - Come on.

322
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:52,904
Hurry up!

323
00:19:53,133 --> 00:19:54,237
This way. - This way.

324
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,480
Listen, this way. - Okay.

325
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,302
This is so beautiful.

326
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,441
Just like a postcard.

327
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,809
Thank you,
Baby, for getting me here.

328
00:20:11,533 --> 00:20:12,705
I am so glad..

329
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,277
...that we didn't go for one of those
usual London-Paris types honeymoon.

330
00:20:19,467 --> 00:20:21,708
I am extra-happy. - Why?

331
00:20:22,133 --> 00:20:24,079
Because there's
no place to shop here.

332
00:20:24,367 --> 00:20:26,176
Otherwise you would
be shopping all day..

333
00:20:26,233 --> 00:20:30,147
...and I would've followed you
around carrying your shopping bags.

334
00:20:32,767 --> 00:20:34,246
What's the point
of coming this far..

335
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,346
...when you're still
glued to this cellphone?

336
00:20:37,467 --> 00:20:38,741
It's an alarm.

337
00:20:39,267 --> 00:20:41,372
Alarm? - It's the last
day for your antibiotic.

338
00:20:42,633 --> 00:20:44,340
You didn't remember.

339
00:20:45,033 --> 00:20:46,341
So I've done that for you.

340
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,438
My nutcase husband.

341
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,744
I love you. - I love you too, baby.

342
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,242
Now, all the fruit juice
that I drank, I need to.. - Yuck!

343
00:21:03,367 --> 00:21:05,108
You always have to spoil the moment,
don't you?

344
00:21:05,167 --> 00:21:07,169
Look, I can either
spoil the moment or..

345
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:09,372
Shut up! Just go. - Okay.

346
00:21:09,433 --> 00:21:11,003
Have your medicines, I'll be back.

347
00:21:11,633 --> 00:21:12,407
I love you.

348
00:23:13,367 --> 00:23:14,607
Arjun.

349
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,208
Arjun.

350
00:23:28,067 --> 00:23:29,137
Arjun.

351
00:23:29,967 --> 00:23:31,207
This is not funny.

352
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,306
Arjun!

353
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:56,572
Oh my God!

354
00:23:58,833 --> 00:23:59,971
Somebody help!

355
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:01,937
Somebody help!

356
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:06,974
Hello, dad.

357
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,279
Did you do what you went there for?

358
00:25:11,267 --> 00:25:12,075
No, dad.

359
00:25:13,067 --> 00:25:14,205
But I'll get it done.

360
00:25:14,967 --> 00:25:17,038
Actually, it was evening
by the time I got here.

361
00:25:17,367 --> 00:25:19,040
Who are you making excuses to, son?

362
00:25:19,233 --> 00:25:20,405
Me or to yourself?

363
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,777
No, dad. It's nothing like that.

364
00:25:23,234 --> 00:25:24,872
I know, it's not a easy job..

365
00:25:24,934 --> 00:25:27,676
..but my experience says,
either you do it now or never.

366
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,841
Do you understand
what I'm trying to say?

367
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,172
Yes, I'm understand.

368
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:35,875
Take care.

369
00:25:43,367 --> 00:25:46,246
Can I come in? - Yeah. Sure.

370
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,770
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

371
00:25:52,933 --> 00:25:54,310
Please sit.

372
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,074
Is everything okay with your room?

373
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:04,939
Anything I can do to help?
- Yeah. Everything okay.

374
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,343
Room is perfect. - Okay.

375
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,711
Ahana, there's something
I want to say to you.

376
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:11,871
I..

377
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,676
...I am not like your other guests.

378
00:26:16,967 --> 00:26:18,173
I've come here with a purpose.

379
00:26:19,267 --> 00:26:22,339
You tried to hide it, but I know.

380
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,705
What?

381
00:26:23,767 --> 00:26:26,680
I know you're Kunal Anand,
the famous writer.

382
00:26:26,867 --> 00:26:28,813
And you're here to
write your new novel.

383
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,174
My receptionist told me.

384
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,802
She's a big fan of yours.

385
00:26:34,167 --> 00:26:35,805
So.. you were saying something.

386
00:26:38,234 --> 00:26:39,042
Yes.

387
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,943
Ahana.. - Excuse me, ma'am.

388
00:26:43,867 --> 00:26:45,346
Ma'am, there's a
call from the hospital.

389
00:26:45,933 --> 00:26:47,674
Hospital? - Yes, ma'am.

390
00:26:47,734 --> 00:26:49,304
Ma'am, the forest
department officials.

391
00:26:49,367 --> 00:26:50,971
...have admitted someone
in the hospital.

392
00:26:51,034 --> 00:26:53,844
And they think it's one
of the guests from our hotel.

393
00:26:54,167 --> 00:26:55,874
Ma'am, patient is seriously injured.

394
00:26:55,934 --> 00:26:57,777
My God. Tell them I am coming.

395
00:26:57,867 --> 00:26:58,709
Okay ma'am.

396
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,113
You see doctor, it's difficult
to catch this thing. - Yes.

397
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,836
We cannot do anything about it.

398
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:17,742
Do you get it? - Yes.

399
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:21,009
Excuse me, I am Ahana Dutt
from Glendale Forest Lodge.

400
00:27:21,067 --> 00:27:22,910
Someone called about
our hotel's. - Rana!

401
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,801
Speak to her.

402
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,338
Go, speak to him.

403
00:27:28,767 --> 00:27:29,268
Come.

404
00:27:31,667 --> 00:27:33,112
So I was saying. - Yes.

405
00:27:33,333 --> 00:27:34,937
I am from Glendale Forest. - Yes.

406
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:39,939
Is this napkin from your hotel?

407
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:41,735
Yeah!

408
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,245
We found it on the victim.

409
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,743
That's why we called you.

410
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,038
Can you identify the victim?

411
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:49,871
Yeah, sure.

412
00:27:49,933 --> 00:27:50,308
Come.

413
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,744
Take down their statement.

414
00:28:08,167 --> 00:28:09,043
Oh, God.

415
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,909
Is she a guest in your hotel? - Yes.

416
00:28:12,267 --> 00:28:13,007
Shruti.

417
00:28:13,833 --> 00:28:14,777
What happened to her?

418
00:28:15,067 --> 00:28:18,810
Well.. she was attacked
by a wild animal.

419
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,370
Could be a leopard.

420
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:23,873
She was married recently.

421
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,269
Newly wed.

422
00:28:26,367 --> 00:28:28,313
Her husband, is he okay?

423
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,208
Husband?

424
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,208
There was no one else with her.

425
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,305
We found her alone.

426
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,140
She was partly unconscious.

427
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,738
What could've happened, Kunal?

428
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,973
We'll have to inform
the victim's family.

429
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:43,679
You must have her phone
number or address in your records?

430
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:48,212
I'll call at the hotel and get it.
- Thank you,.

431
00:29:11,767 --> 00:29:14,714
It was my fault that,
I let my daughter come here.

432
00:29:15,867 --> 00:29:16,777
I had told them.

433
00:29:17,167 --> 00:29:19,443
Go to London, go to Paris. Wherever!

434
00:29:20,034 --> 00:29:20,910
But no.

435
00:29:21,167 --> 00:29:22,578
They had to come here.

436
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:23,905
You know why?

437
00:29:24,734 --> 00:29:27,510
Because people like you
give huge ads in the papers.

438
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,906
Make huge promises.

439
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:30,941
"Come to Heaven on Earth."

440
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,779
What you really mean
is "Come to hell".

441
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:41,212
You ruined my daughter's
life to make a few bucks.

442
00:29:44,034 --> 00:29:46,207
You have killed my son-in-law.

443
00:29:46,633 --> 00:29:48,704
You and only you are responsible.

444
00:30:26,633 --> 00:30:27,634
Are you okay?

445
00:30:29,367 --> 00:30:30,277
Shall I call a doctor?

446
00:30:33,734 --> 00:30:37,079
What happened was terrible but,
it wasn't my fault, Kunal.

447
00:30:37,567 --> 00:30:39,342
If I had any clue..

448
00:30:39,667 --> 00:30:41,738
"Then I would've never
let them go there.

449
00:30:43,367 --> 00:30:44,971
For everything that
I have in this world.

450
00:30:45,533 --> 00:30:47,479
...if the people find out,
who's going to live here?

451
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,911
And how will I repay
the bank's loan?

452
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,847
If this hotel shuts down,
then I'm finished.

453
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,008
That won't happen.

454
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,709
God will never let
you lose anything.

455
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:01,644
God!

456
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,640
Sure!

457
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,580
When God didn't help
me out in Mumbai..

458
00:31:06,934 --> 00:31:08,311
...you think He'll
help me in Glendale.

459
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:11,738
He's already snatched
whatever I had.

460
00:31:12,833 --> 00:31:14,278
He can do the same again.

461
00:31:16,567 --> 00:31:17,773
What do you mean?

462
00:31:26,567 --> 00:31:27,602
Ahana.

463
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:32,008
Talking is any day better
than taking these anxiety pills.

464
00:31:33,967 --> 00:31:35,446
My Papa says, that.

465
00:31:36,367 --> 00:31:38,540
...speaking your heart
out doesn't take away the pain.

466
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,375
But the feeling definitely lessens.

467
00:31:44,867 --> 00:31:45,641
Come on.

468
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:50,910
I lost my mother in childhood.

469
00:31:56,567 --> 00:31:58,308
My dad meant everything for me.

470
00:31:58,967 --> 00:32:00,310
'He was my everything.'

471
00:32:01,367 --> 00:32:04,814
'My dad,
my best friend, my confidante.'

472
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,079
'We were very happy together.'

473
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,505
'We had an old bungalow
in South Mumbai..'

474
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,981
'..and some builder wanted to raze
it down and build a shopping mall.'

475
00:32:13,034 --> 00:32:13,444
Think about it.

476
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,741
'But dad didn't want
to sell it at any cost.'

477
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,274
'He used to say that.'

478
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,840
'..no one sells their
family portrait for any price.'

479
00:32:21,633 --> 00:32:23,408
He didn't accept this deal.

480
00:32:23,767 --> 00:32:25,007
'But they were businessmen.'

481
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:25,539
No!

482
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,046
'Dad's emotional talk
had no meaning for them.'

483
00:32:28,867 --> 00:32:31,313
'Gradually requests
turned into threats.'

484
00:32:31,633 --> 00:32:36,742
'And when threats didn't work,
they started scaring us.'

485
00:32:37,767 --> 00:32:41,044
'They would either disconnect
our electricity or telephone line.'

486
00:32:41,767 --> 00:32:43,542
'But dad didn't lose courage.'

487
00:32:44,333 --> 00:32:45,334
'He kept fighting.'

488
00:32:45,633 --> 00:32:48,443
'But they knew,
that dad didn't need money.'

489
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,041
'So they created the need.'

490
00:32:52,367 --> 00:32:53,437
'They used political pressure.'

491
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,070
'..and got dad fired from his job.'

492
00:32:56,633 --> 00:32:57,577
'Not just that.'

493
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:00,474
'They made sure that he
didn't get a job anywhere else.'

494
00:33:01,034 --> 00:33:03,947
'A man can stand
humiliation from others.'

495
00:33:04,633 --> 00:33:06,408
'But when he loses
respect in his own eye..'

496
00:33:07,467 --> 00:33:08,502
'..he's completely shattered.'

497
00:33:09,633 --> 00:33:13,274
'I saw dad die a little each day.'

498
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:19,475
'And then one day,
that courageous man..

499
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:21,903
...lost..'

500
00:33:43,567 --> 00:33:44,375
Ahana.

501
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:48,372
I am just a psychiatrist for others.

502
00:33:49,833 --> 00:33:51,744
But I've seen you grow up.

503
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,270
I'm like your mother.

504
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,810
Look, in such situations.

505
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,112
...keeping to yourself
only does more damage.

506
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,805
You can share anything with me.

507
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,136
After dad's death.

508
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,602
I was shattered from within.

509
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,736
I can't fight the world now.

510
00:34:19,434 --> 00:34:23,246
I'll sell my property to
those builders and go a new place.

511
00:34:24,433 --> 00:34:26,242
Where I won't have to fight anyone?

512
00:34:26,767 --> 00:34:29,247
And what if you face problems
in that new place too?

513
00:34:30,833 --> 00:34:32,278
You'll shift to a
different place again?

514
00:34:34,433 --> 00:34:36,674
Running away from problems
is not the solution, Ahana.

515
00:34:37,233 --> 00:34:38,712
You have to learn to fight.

516
00:34:39,667 --> 00:34:40,475
I know..

517
00:34:42,433 --> 00:34:44,777
But. I don't have
the strength to fight.

518
00:34:48,667 --> 00:34:50,169
I've decided.

519
00:34:51,434 --> 00:34:52,174
Fine.

520
00:34:53,733 --> 00:34:56,577
I don't want to pressurize you now..

521
00:34:57,167 --> 00:35:01,673
But yes.. you know it,
if you want share anything.

522
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,243
...I am just a call away.

523
00:35:07,567 --> 00:35:09,137
These are Alprazolam pills.

524
00:35:09,367 --> 00:35:11,574
It'll help you fight anxiety.

525
00:35:13,167 --> 00:35:13,872
Thank you.

526
00:35:15,234 --> 00:35:16,178
One more thing.

527
00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:20,643
The urge to commit
suicide is genetic.

528
00:35:21,367 --> 00:35:24,837
Whatever you're experiencing,
thinking right now..

529
00:35:25,567 --> 00:35:27,444
...is taking you in that direction.

530
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:29,711
Don't ever go there.

531
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,701
I know you are strong.

532
00:35:47,434 --> 00:35:49,311
Ahana, if we live in our past,
it makes us depressed..

533
00:35:50,467 --> 00:35:51,741
...and thinking of the
future makes us restless.

534
00:35:53,534 --> 00:35:54,706
So you should live in the present.

535
00:35:55,367 --> 00:35:56,505
Because the present is beautiful.

536
00:35:57,434 --> 00:35:58,572
There's nothing wrong in it.

537
00:36:02,434 --> 00:36:03,435
That's sweet.

538
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,345
Finally we agree on one thing.

539
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,602
The Forest Department is helping us.

540
00:36:27,667 --> 00:36:29,704
They will soon find a solution.

541
00:36:29,967 --> 00:36:31,605
But as long as that's not done..

542
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:34,840
...I would request all of
you not to wander in the forest.

543
00:36:34,933 --> 00:36:36,344
If we can't go in the forest.

544
00:36:36,567 --> 00:36:37,841
...what's the point
of staying in this hotel?

545
00:36:38,367 --> 00:36:39,675
It's just a matter of few days.

546
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,337
We're really sorry
for this inconvenience.

547
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:44,408
I'll wrap up this
as soon as possible.

548
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,208
Hey you..

549
00:36:56,767 --> 00:36:57,768
You're doing a great job.

550
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,242
Don't worry.

551
00:37:05,934 --> 00:37:07,470
Amit. - Yes, boss.

552
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,737
We'll be also making rice
cakes and lentil for breakfast.

553
00:37:10,634 --> 00:37:14,673
Ready the coconut chutney.
- Okay, boss.

554
00:38:28,267 --> 00:38:29,177
Hello.

555
00:38:29,534 --> 00:38:30,376
It's me.

556
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,070
Your beloved.

557
00:38:32,334 --> 00:38:33,972
Your love.

558
00:38:34,567 --> 00:38:35,511
How's the kid?

559
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,238
If the kid's ill,
then take her to a doctor.

560
00:38:42,867 --> 00:38:45,245
Wife, don't trust
the newspapers of Bhopal.

561
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,506
They write nonsense.

562
00:38:47,034 --> 00:38:48,069
Don't worry about me.

563
00:38:48,134 --> 00:38:49,545
I never venture out of the hotel.

564
00:38:50,167 --> 00:38:52,238
My duty's in the kitchen.

565
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,479
Look after yourself, and the kids.

566
00:38:55,034 --> 00:38:56,274
Okay?

567
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,304
Amit, pick up the phone.

568
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,936
Amit, please pick up the phone.

569
00:39:52,567 --> 00:39:54,205
Pick up the phone.

570
00:39:56,367 --> 00:39:57,903
Amit, pick up the phone.

571
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:17,904
Oh my, God.

572
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,301
How are you?

573
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,144
I am fine.

574
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,273
Have you sent the sari to Sarita?

575
00:42:24,067 --> 00:42:25,205
Don't worry at all.

576
00:42:26,534 --> 00:42:27,569
Take it on credit.

577
00:42:28,034 --> 00:42:29,980
Don't worry, we'll cut
a few trees and pay you back.

578
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,110
You'll get your money.

579
00:42:31,167 --> 00:42:32,237
Don't worry at all.

580
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,840
See you in the evening.

581
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:35,903
Don't forget to arrange for booze.

582
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,944
I'll talk to you later.

583
00:42:37,967 --> 00:42:40,413
Excuse me. - He worked
in your hotel, didn't he?

584
00:42:41,467 --> 00:42:42,445
I heard he was your cook.

585
00:42:43,034 --> 00:42:43,375
Yes.

586
00:42:43,434 --> 00:42:46,040
That's alright,
madam, but first tell me..

587
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,841
...what was he doing
in the jungle late at night.

588
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,038
He didn't venture into the jungle.

589
00:42:49,467 --> 00:42:50,468
Don't you understand.

590
00:42:50,833 --> 00:42:52,210
...that animal's
ventured into my hotel.

591
00:42:54,267 --> 00:42:55,337
Your hotel..

592
00:42:57,034 --> 00:42:58,104
Have you found rest of the body?

593
00:42:59,567 --> 00:43:00,511
Can't you see?

594
00:43:01,367 --> 00:43:02,471
This is the body.. - Sir.

595
00:43:02,534 --> 00:43:04,013
What more.. - Sir, please.

596
00:43:04,867 --> 00:43:06,540
Ma'am, we're looking for it.

597
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,470
We'll find it. Soon.

598
00:43:09,933 --> 00:43:11,207
Is that panther behind this?

599
00:43:12,534 --> 00:43:13,604
Listen to her.

600
00:43:14,134 --> 00:43:16,205
How would we know
who was behind it?

601
00:43:16,367 --> 00:43:19,109
You think the panther will
leave his visiting card behind.

602
00:43:34,267 --> 00:43:35,371
Excuse me ma'am.

603
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,277
Mr. Rawat from the
bank is here.

604
00:43:42,167 --> 00:43:43,043
Okay.

605
00:43:54,034 --> 00:43:55,035
Please come. - Thank you.

606
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,340
Hello, Mr. Rawat. - Hello.

607
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:56,878
How are you?

608
00:43:56,934 --> 00:43:57,309
Good.

609
00:43:57,467 --> 00:43:58,571
Tea, coffee? - No, thank you.

610
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,403
Have a seat.

611
00:44:03,434 --> 00:44:07,382
Ahana, I'm really upset
about what happened.

612
00:44:07,934 --> 00:44:10,437
First the honeymoon couple,
and then the cook.

613
00:44:11,467 --> 00:44:15,142
I mean, this isn't good
for your hotel's reputation.

614
00:44:15,934 --> 00:44:18,540
And you know people come
here to enjoy the forest.

615
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,046
If they can't venture
into the forest, then"

616
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:24,580
The Chairman thinks.
- I understand your concern.

617
00:44:25,267 --> 00:44:27,076
Look, this is a
setback for us as well.

618
00:44:27,334 --> 00:44:29,507
But please assure him
there's nothing to worry about.

619
00:44:29,934 --> 00:44:31,607
We're trying our
best to solve it soon.

620
00:44:32,267 --> 00:44:35,009
Right, right.. that's exactly
what we wanted to hear from you.

621
00:44:35,134 --> 00:44:35,578
Thank you.

622
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,040
Thank you for your assurance.

623
00:44:37,567 --> 00:44:38,602
Okay, I'll take your leave.

624
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:39,310
Okay.

625
00:44:39,367 --> 00:44:41,608
Thank you, Mr. Rawat. - Bye.

626
00:44:52,267 --> 00:44:53,837
Ahana, I've a way out of this.

627
00:44:56,867 --> 00:44:58,869
I've some friends who
can son this out for us.

628
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:04,705
I'll just have to
make few phones calls.

629
00:45:05,067 --> 00:45:06,068
...and some arrangements.

630
00:45:09,834 --> 00:45:10,835
Can you trust me?

631
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,174
Truth isn't what you see..

632
00:45:37,834 --> 00:45:41,179
...on Discovery channel
or the internet.

633
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:43,573
If you see them up close..

634
00:45:43,633 --> 00:45:45,135
"These wild animals
can be very cunning.

635
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,235
...and very dangerous.

636
00:45:46,534 --> 00:45:47,069
Thank you.

637
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,310
By the way, the forest
officers are not at fault.

638
00:45:52,234 --> 00:45:54,714
They aren't even well-equipped
to defend themselves.

639
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,670
If and when they are attacked.

640
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,911
You get just one chance to shoot.

641
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:05,771
And when you do, you need
to be fully prepared for it.

642
00:46:08,067 --> 00:46:10,013
Ahana, I'll be lying if I say..

643
00:46:10,067 --> 00:46:12,206
...I can feel exactly what
you're going through right now.

644
00:46:13,867 --> 00:46:15,175
But I promise you one thing.

645
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,976
I will leave no stone unturned.

646
00:46:20,134 --> 00:46:21,010
Nagesh.

647
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:38,135
Professor. - Yes.

648
00:46:38,734 --> 00:46:39,644
Here you go.

649
00:46:40,134 --> 00:46:41,670
When I was interviewing that girl..

650
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,307
...my assistant recorded
the conversation on his phone.

651
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:45,608
Just for a backup.

652
00:46:46,067 --> 00:46:47,045
There's a copy in here.

653
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:48,678
Thank you.

654
00:46:48,834 --> 00:46:49,278
Most welcome.

655
00:46:49,734 --> 00:46:51,680
How do I explain what it was?

656
00:46:53,134 --> 00:46:56,809
It wasn't human.. or animal.

657
00:46:57,867 --> 00:46:59,574
It was 10 feet tall.

658
00:47:00,167 --> 00:47:02,044
It was huge.

659
00:47:03,633 --> 00:47:07,103
It had a long-broad tall,
like a lizard.

660
00:47:08,067 --> 00:47:09,671
Long and sharp teeth.

661
00:47:10,334 --> 00:47:11,813
And strange eyes.

662
00:47:12,867 --> 00:47:13,572
He..

663
00:47:14,867 --> 00:47:16,778
This is no lion or cheetah.

664
00:47:18,334 --> 00:47:18,937
It's him.

665
00:47:19,534 --> 00:47:20,638
He killed my husband.

666
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:21,871
It's him.

667
00:47:23,134 --> 00:47:24,943
Ahana ma'am. Come quickly.

668
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,536
The hunters have got the panther.

669
00:47:39,467 --> 00:47:41,845
Oh my god, this is the same panther.

670
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:45,944
My photo is here... - Wait..wait..

671
00:47:46,534 --> 00:47:48,070
Shall we take our photograph.
- Yes of course.

672
00:47:48,134 --> 00:47:50,136
Are you old enough
to take a picture?

673
00:47:59,767 --> 00:48:00,677
Thank you, God!

674
00:48:01,134 --> 00:48:02,169
This is not fair.

675
00:48:04,834 --> 00:48:06,040
I do all the work..

676
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,674
...and your God takes all the credit.

677
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,140
Not done.

678
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,607
How do you know what
I'm thanking God for?

679
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:39,778
"I'm no longer.. what I was."

680
00:48:40,367 --> 00:48:45,646
"I've left myself..
somewhere behind."

681
00:49:04,034 --> 00:49:09,985
"I'm no longer.. what I was."

682
00:49:10,034 --> 00:49:15,143
"I've left myself..
somewhere behind."

683
00:49:15,367 --> 00:49:19,975
"I'm getting drawn towards you."

684
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:26,448
"I'm turning into you."

685
00:49:26,834 --> 00:49:31,681
"I'm surrendering myself to love."

686
00:49:32,867 --> 00:49:37,680
"I want to die, only to live again."

687
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:44,011
"I'm surrendering myself to love."

688
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:49,843
"I want to die, only to live again."

689
00:49:52,034 --> 00:49:52,876
Yes dad.

690
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,377
You couldn't do it yet, could you?

691
00:49:55,133 --> 00:49:56,043
Dad, l..

692
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:57,911
I think you won't be able to do it.

693
00:49:57,967 --> 00:49:58,877
Come back.

694
00:50:00,033 --> 00:50:00,977
I Will do it, dad.

695
00:50:01,967 --> 00:50:02,843
I'm hanging up.

696
00:50:05,034 --> 00:50:09,380
Kunal you've been nominated
for author's choice awards.

697
00:50:09,433 --> 00:50:10,639
Congratulations.

698
00:50:16,734 --> 00:50:18,042
I'll see you.

699
00:50:18,967 --> 00:50:20,913
...if you're with me."

700
00:50:21,867 --> 00:50:26,748
"I'll forsake the world, I promise."

701
00:50:27,934 --> 00:50:32,644
"No matter how many times we meet,
it's never enough."

702
00:50:33,933 --> 00:50:38,678
"I spend each day with you,
but my hean isn't fulfilled."

703
00:50:38,967 --> 00:50:43,541
"I started to smile
after a lifetime."

704
00:50:44,967 --> 00:50:50,508
"I am waiting for you."

705
00:50:50,567 --> 00:50:55,175
"I'm surrendering myself to love."

706
00:50:56,634 --> 00:51:01,105
"I want to die, only to live again."

707
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:08,175
"I'm surrendering myself to love."

708
00:51:08,634 --> 00:51:13,014
"I want to die, only to live again."

709
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:56,245
"Your words sound like a prayer."

710
00:51:57,534 --> 00:52:02,313
"That soothes my heart."

711
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:08,179
"One can see God in
the eyes of the beloved."

712
00:52:09,367 --> 00:52:14,248
"I've finally realized that."

713
00:52:14,567 --> 00:52:19,414
"I now bow before you."

714
00:52:20,534 --> 00:52:25,779
"Now I wait in your path."

715
00:52:26,167 --> 00:52:30,582
"I'm surrendering myself to love."

716
00:52:32,133 --> 00:52:36,548
"I want to die, only to live again."

717
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:43,914
"I'm surrendering myself to love."

718
00:52:44,234 --> 00:52:48,876
"I want to die, only to live again."

719
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:24,338
Most people invest in
stocks at the wrong time.

720
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,141
Run, Tushar!

721
00:54:20,733 --> 00:54:21,643
Close it!

722
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:11,274
No!

723
00:57:22,434 --> 00:57:23,435
Let's go.

724
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:39,112
What you just saw..

725
00:59:40,867 --> 00:59:44,576
...is what had attacked before
and you thought, it was some..

726
00:59:44,734 --> 00:59:46,304
...wild animal or panther.

727
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:49,675
Actually, it was
a 'Brahma Rakshas' (Demon).

728
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:52,168
'Brahma Rakshas'?

729
00:59:53,134 --> 00:59:54,112
What the hell is that?

730
00:59:57,834 --> 01:00:00,280
You will find its mention
in the local folktale.

731
01:00:01,334 --> 01:00:04,144
Of course, there's a detailed
mention about it in our scriptures.

732
01:00:05,067 --> 01:00:06,842
You can even read
it on the internet.

733
01:00:09,267 --> 01:00:12,680
It's called the 'Brahma
Rakshas' because.

734
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:15,705
...it's a curse levied on people..

735
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:22,006
...who swore to dedicate their
entire life to Brahma, i.e. God.

736
01:00:22,934 --> 01:00:25,175
But they couldn't
control their bad nature.

737
01:00:25,234 --> 01:00:28,272
And infested by their
greed or selfishness..

738
01:00:28,334 --> 01:00:31,713
..they committed
a unpardonable crime.

739
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:33,770
Something like a rape..

740
01:00:35,333 --> 01:00:36,175
...or a murder.

741
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:37,970
But what was this curse.

742
01:00:41,034 --> 01:00:44,572
The curse was that he won't
be allowed in Heaven or hell.

743
01:00:45,734 --> 01:00:49,113
He won't be human or demon.

744
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:52,840
His soul will never
attain salvation or solace.

745
01:00:54,767 --> 01:00:57,771
His soul will stay
imprisoned in his body.

746
01:00:58,067 --> 01:01:01,776
And his body will slowly morph..

747
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:05,107
...into a dangerous creature,
befitting his deeds.

748
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:09,078
And it won't have
any element of humanity.

749
01:01:11,067 --> 01:01:13,104
Basically it will
turn into an animal.

750
01:01:13,267 --> 01:01:15,110
Without any human
left inside of him.

751
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:18,245
But what's fascinating is..

752
01:01:19,167 --> 01:01:20,771
..the more he eats...

753
01:01:23,667 --> 01:01:25,078
...the more his hunger grows.

754
01:01:25,734 --> 01:01:27,145
Of course,
those who gave him this curse.

755
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:30,113
...didn't know that
his insatiable hunger..

756
01:01:30,167 --> 01:01:32,340
...will force him to target humans.

757
01:01:34,134 --> 01:01:36,307
You two may be wondering that,
though I'm a zoology professor..

758
01:01:36,533 --> 01:01:39,810
...I'm speaking about such
old and whimsical fantasies.

759
01:01:40,667 --> 01:01:42,305
But you'll be surprised
to know that.

760
01:01:43,667 --> 01:01:46,273
...scientists are the
most fascinated, by fantasies.

761
01:01:47,267 --> 01:01:49,042
Because a fantasy
is nothing but a fact.

762
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:50,272
...that is waiting to be discovered.

763
01:01:50,633 --> 01:01:52,271
But if 'Brahma Rakshas' exist.

764
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:53,908
..then why hasn't anyone seen them?

765
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,946
Because those who
saw a 'Brahma Rakshas'..

766
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:58,135
..aren't alive anymore.

767
01:01:58,767 --> 01:02:00,906
And, no one believes
those who are alive.

768
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:03,678
Just like spotting a UFO.

769
01:02:04,134 --> 01:02:05,135
Or a ghost story.

770
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:08,080
What mistake did we
commit that he's here?

771
01:02:08,667 --> 01:02:09,702
What wrong have we done?

772
01:02:10,067 --> 01:02:11,239
It's not your fault.

773
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:14,876
But yes, a mistake's been made.

774
01:02:15,067 --> 01:02:15,977
What do you mean?

775
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,173
The highway construction
workers made a mistake.

776
01:02:19,934 --> 01:02:22,574
There's a solution to every problem.

777
01:02:23,034 --> 01:02:24,536
And similarly,
there was a solution.

778
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:27,740
...to keep 'Brahma Rakshas'
away from populated areas.

779
01:02:28,867 --> 01:02:33,782
A red thread was tied on
the banyan tree outside the village.

780
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:36,839
To curtain the powers
of the 'Brahma Rakshas'.

781
01:02:37,867 --> 01:02:39,847
Just like a 'Lakshman Rekha'

782
01:02:41,067 --> 01:02:42,102
These construction workers..

783
01:02:42,167 --> 01:02:45,205
...uprooted many
of those banyan trees.

784
01:02:47,167 --> 01:02:49,169
And made that demon more powerful.

785
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:51,746
So, Professor,
how do we get rid of this?

786
01:02:52,267 --> 01:02:53,541
What can we do?

787
01:02:54,867 --> 01:02:55,572
Nothing.

788
01:02:57,267 --> 01:02:59,543
Because there's nothing
that you can do.

789
01:03:00,767 --> 01:03:02,872
Just save yourself and run away.

790
01:03:03,867 --> 01:03:06,347
As soon as the conditions stabilize,
we'll inform you..

791
01:03:06,567 --> 01:03:09,047
..but, in the meantime
be thankful that you're alive.

792
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:11,546
And please go away,
as soon as possible.

793
01:03:12,133 --> 01:03:13,237
Just shut this hotel down.

794
01:03:14,134 --> 01:03:16,011
Please, just shut this hotel down.

795
01:03:36,567 --> 01:03:37,341
Ahana.

796
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:01,608
Shall we go, Ahana?

797
01:04:04,634 --> 01:04:05,578
I am not going.

798
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:11,374
Hey!

799
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:13,444
What are you saying?

800
01:04:16,467 --> 01:04:17,878
This time I won't run.

801
01:04:19,834 --> 01:04:21,973
I came here fearing
the creatures in the city.

802
01:04:23,334 --> 01:04:26,338
I can't be scared by the creatures
here and go back to the city.

803
01:04:28,334 --> 01:04:29,836
There's no choice but to fight.

804
01:04:57,334 --> 01:04:58,404
I am here.

805
01:05:00,767 --> 01:05:02,838
Only one of us will survive.

806
01:05:05,434 --> 01:05:06,037
You..

807
01:05:08,667 --> 01:05:09,509
Or me!

808
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:00,472
Hello. - Hello.

809
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:02,111
This is the chairman, Mr. Raman.

810
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:03,209
Hi.- Hi.

811
01:06:03,467 --> 01:06:05,538
Thank you for seeing
us at such a short notice.

812
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:08,508
But Mr. Raman wanted to
see you as soon as possible.

813
01:06:09,234 --> 01:06:10,645
I understand, please sit. - Yes.

814
01:06:17,667 --> 01:06:20,648
It's a bit strange, Ms. Ahana,
but.. what to do.

815
01:06:22,334 --> 01:06:26,305
Our bank has invested
a huge capital in your venture.

816
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:27,678
I understand.

817
01:06:28,534 --> 01:06:30,138
I am really trying to fight this.

818
01:06:31,467 --> 01:06:32,844
Since you've trusted me so far..

819
01:06:33,134 --> 01:06:33,771
...please have a little more faith.

820
01:06:35,134 --> 01:06:36,272
I wish we could do that.

821
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:37,869
Rawat.

822
01:06:43,767 --> 01:06:44,677
What is this?

823
01:06:44,833 --> 01:06:45,903
It's a order.

824
01:06:47,767 --> 01:06:48,404
What?

825
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:50,545
Para 3 clause 12.1!

826
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:54,809
It clearly states,
that if at any stage..

827
01:06:55,234 --> 01:06:57,874
..the bank feels your hotel's
making a loss or liable to..

828
01:06:58,567 --> 01:07:01,446
...the bank will take over
the management of the hotel.

829
01:07:02,267 --> 01:07:03,769
And that's exactly
what we're trying to do.

830
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:04,837
What do you mean?

831
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,437
You're threatening to
evict Ahana from her own hotel.

832
01:07:07,633 --> 01:07:08,509
Look, mister.

833
01:07:09,234 --> 01:07:10,440
It's nothing personal, alright.

834
01:07:11,167 --> 01:07:13,613
It's business.
- No, this is not business.

835
01:07:14,567 --> 01:07:15,671
It's blackmail.

836
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:19,304
Look, I'm only demanding
what's written in the agreement.

837
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:20,435
And I am sure...

838
01:07:20,767 --> 01:07:23,748
Ms. Ahana must have read
the agreement before she signed it.

839
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:24,537
Right?

840
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:33,647
I did, but I guess you
people didn't read it properly.

841
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,175
But doesn't this
agreement also state.

842
01:07:37,534 --> 01:07:38,706
...that you'll give
me a 10 day prior notice.

843
01:07:38,767 --> 01:07:40,371
...before doing anything like this?

844
01:07:42,633 --> 01:07:43,771
It does.

845
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:49,647
So, Mr. Rawat, ask him to
get off my property immediately.

846
01:07:49,867 --> 01:07:52,211
And don't show me your
face for the next 10 days.

847
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:57,478
Fine, Ms. Ahana.

848
01:07:57,734 --> 01:07:59,213
We'll come on the 11th day.

849
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:00,642
But don't forget.

850
01:08:01,367 --> 01:08:04,143
That day you won't
just evacuate this hotel..

851
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:06,510
...in fact, we'll sell
every piece of this property.

852
01:08:06,733 --> 01:08:08,406
...and recover our interest.

853
01:08:08,867 --> 01:08:10,642
So till then" all the best.

854
01:08:11,334 --> 01:08:11,903
Let's go, Rawat.

855
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:12,678
Yes.

856
01:08:18,267 --> 01:08:19,405
Bloody vultures.

857
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:23,538
They are vultures.

858
01:08:24,567 --> 01:08:26,205
"But I'm not a dead body yet.

859
01:08:36,667 --> 01:08:38,476
If my hotel was operational..

860
01:08:38,533 --> 01:08:40,479
...you wouldn't have to
go through this inconvenience.

861
01:08:45,467 --> 01:08:46,707
So you didn't go back.

862
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:48,711
I tried, Professor.

863
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:52,476
..but running away
seems more difficult.

864
01:08:54,034 --> 01:08:55,945
On one side I can hear your words.

865
01:08:56,334 --> 01:08:57,938
..that, this is beyond my limit.

866
01:08:58,534 --> 01:09:01,208
And on the other, I can
hear the screams of the people.

867
01:09:01,534 --> 01:09:03,013
...who came here trusting me.

868
01:09:03,434 --> 01:09:04,572
And I couldn't save them.

869
01:09:05,967 --> 01:09:09,505
I've realized that this is my fight.

870
01:09:10,267 --> 01:09:14,215
And if I leave it,
then I might survive..

871
01:09:15,367 --> 01:09:17,108
..but, I'll never
be able to sleep again.

872
01:09:29,134 --> 01:09:30,010
Sorry.

873
01:09:31,234 --> 01:09:33,145
There's an important
meeting going on inside.

874
01:09:33,534 --> 01:09:34,535
Sir's busy.

875
01:09:35,234 --> 01:09:37,180
He said he's sent
the report to Shimla.

876
01:09:37,634 --> 01:09:40,513
As soon as the Wildlife Trust of
India receives orders from Shimla...

877
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,173
...they will form
a team and inform us.

878
01:09:43,434 --> 01:09:46,142
Can't we just meet him, once?

879
01:09:47,534 --> 01:09:48,376
I am sorry.

880
01:09:49,434 --> 01:09:52,506
Officer Rana,
even we understand these excuses.

881
01:09:53,367 --> 01:09:54,437
But the question is..

882
01:09:54,534 --> 01:09:56,275
..whether you want
to help is or not?

883
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:01,612
"My head's on fire."

884
01:10:04,934 --> 01:10:06,311
So this is your meeting?

885
01:10:06,534 --> 01:10:09,140
And you don't have time
to listen to people's complaints.

886
01:10:12,134 --> 01:10:13,010
Who are you?

887
01:10:13,567 --> 01:10:15,137
You can't just barge
in a government office?

888
01:10:15,534 --> 01:10:16,478
Who let you in?

889
01:10:16,534 --> 01:10:18,275
Rana, how did they get inside?

890
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:19,974
We're inside now.

891
01:10:20,167 --> 01:10:21,737
So now give us a docket number.

892
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:22,637
Docket number?

893
01:10:23,534 --> 01:10:24,376
What docket number?

894
01:10:24,434 --> 01:10:26,277
For the report that
you sent to Shimla.

895
01:10:30,767 --> 01:10:31,370
That report?

896
01:10:34,967 --> 01:10:35,843
What report?

897
01:10:37,667 --> 01:10:39,112
You all think I am crazy?

898
01:10:39,434 --> 01:10:41,971
You think you'll all tell
me a story, and I will believe you.

899
01:10:42,034 --> 01:10:43,445
And then we'll set
out to play in the jungle.

900
01:10:43,667 --> 01:10:44,975
This is not a story,
I've studied this.

901
01:10:45,034 --> 01:10:45,978
What do you want to say?

902
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:47,975
I've been doing squat
in the jungle for 22 years.

903
01:10:48,334 --> 01:10:49,745
From the ants to the elephant.

904
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:51,677
...I've an account
of everything in this.

905
01:10:51,801 --> 01:10:54,077
These writers never write
their book before interviewing us.

906
01:10:54,667 --> 01:10:57,739
And the animals which
you teach kids about.

907
01:10:57,900 --> 01:10:58,970
...we've dealt with them.

908
01:10:59,334 --> 01:11:01,712
There's no such thing
as 'Brahma Rakshah'.

909
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:03,204
It's just an old folktale
of these villages.

910
01:11:03,267 --> 01:11:04,211
...and you believe them.

911
01:11:04,267 --> 01:11:06,247
Closing your eyes won't help,
officer.

912
01:11:06,834 --> 01:11:08,279
There are others who have seen it.

913
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:11,681
Not one,
I can get you twenty witnesses.

914
01:11:12,067 --> 01:11:13,705
And they'll tell the media..

915
01:11:13,767 --> 01:11:15,678
...how you failed to believed
them and didn't take any action.

916
01:11:15,834 --> 01:11:16,471
Do you get that?

917
01:11:16,767 --> 01:11:17,438
You...

918
01:11:17,767 --> 01:11:19,678
Although you're working
like you're retired.

919
01:11:19,734 --> 01:11:21,213
But if your superiors find out.

920
01:11:21,267 --> 01:11:23,770
"Then you'll even
lose your pension.

921
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:27,113
You.. - And through
RTI if people find out.

922
01:11:27,167 --> 01:11:28,874
...that you didn't take any action...

923
01:11:28,934 --> 01:11:30,709
...then there will be
action taken against you.

924
01:11:33,001 --> 01:11:35,777
Anger has never helped anyone.

925
01:11:36,201 --> 01:11:36,975
No, right?

926
01:11:39,167 --> 01:11:40,840
Tell me.. what can I do?

927
01:11:42,967 --> 01:11:44,947
Cooperation from your
office and few weapons.

928
01:11:46,767 --> 01:11:47,370
Weapons.

929
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:53,043
Now according to my research.

930
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:55,671
...the weapon that we
use to kill 'Brahma Rakshas'..

931
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:01,176
...should be smeared with
the ashes of Banyan tree leaves.

932
01:12:05,867 --> 01:12:06,675
Okay.

933
01:12:08,801 --> 01:12:10,007
So now this is the plan.

934
01:12:15,467 --> 01:12:18,209
Suppose this is the highway
heading towards Shimla.

935
01:12:21,834 --> 01:12:24,474
Just like we use a
mousetrap to catch a mouse..

936
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:30,710
...similarly,
we use a trap to catch this demon.

937
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:35,112
And the trap will be.. an old bus.

938
01:12:37,134 --> 01:12:39,171
We'll keep a human
dummy inside the bus.

939
01:12:40,401 --> 01:12:42,210
And we'll cover it with
blood from the blood bank..

940
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:45,137
...and fresh meat from the market.

941
01:12:47,167 --> 01:12:49,670
Just like a mouse is
drawn by the smell of cheese.

942
01:12:50,401 --> 01:12:51,812
...similarly,
this demon will be drawn towards.

943
01:12:51,867 --> 01:12:53,175
..the smell of blood and meat.

944
01:12:53,434 --> 01:12:54,344
But remember one thing.

945
01:12:55,867 --> 01:13:01,249
No one will fire as long as
he isn't completely in our clutches.

946
01:13:02,401 --> 01:13:05,007
Because 1 or 2 bullets
won't harm him.

947
01:13:07,301 --> 01:13:09,303
We'll have to shower
him with bullets.

948
01:14:28,267 --> 01:14:29,268
He's coming.

949
01:14:29,667 --> 01:14:31,305
I can see him.

950
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:32,203
No one moves.

951
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,946
No one does anything until
he's completely inside the bus.

952
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:35,842
Understood?

953
01:14:36,367 --> 01:14:37,141
Understood.

954
01:14:37,367 --> 01:14:37,936
Understood.

955
01:14:42,067 --> 01:14:43,102
He's heading towards the bus.

956
01:15:20,067 --> 01:15:21,705
Go closer to the bus.

957
01:15:22,667 --> 01:15:23,771
And when I tell you..

958
01:15:24,167 --> 01:15:25,771
"Start firing at him.

959
01:15:26,334 --> 01:15:27,005
Okay.

960
01:16:26,567 --> 01:16:27,307
Come on.

961
01:16:31,567 --> 01:16:32,841
What the bloody hell is happening?

962
01:16:32,901 --> 01:16:34,073
Come on.

963
01:16:51,701 --> 01:16:52,304
This way.

964
01:18:01,634 --> 01:18:02,544
Fire!

965
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:26,806
Run!

966
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:27,942
Go, come on.

967
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:30,078
Run!

968
01:18:31,567 --> 01:18:32,568
Ahana, that way.

969
01:18:41,567 --> 01:18:43,376
Fast, close it.

970
01:19:44,501 --> 01:19:45,479
Come on..

971
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:28,677
I had told you before.

972
01:20:28,934 --> 01:20:30,538
You won't be able to endure this.

973
01:20:31,667 --> 01:20:32,805
You should have left.

974
01:20:33,734 --> 01:20:35,543
You said a lot of things, Professor.

975
01:20:36,767 --> 01:20:37,609
But what happened.

976
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:41,277
The bullets didn't
have any effect on him.

977
01:20:42,167 --> 01:20:42,838
Ahana.

978
01:20:45,234 --> 01:20:47,145
The professor tried
his best to help.

979
01:20:47,467 --> 01:20:48,946
He even risked his life for us.

980
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:52,574
Sorry.

981
01:20:54,434 --> 01:20:56,243
No, no, you're right.

982
01:20:56,867 --> 01:20:57,902
I was wrong.

983
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:00,702
Because before this,
I had only read..

984
01:21:00,767 --> 01:21:02,303
..about the 'Brahma
Rakshas' only in books.

985
01:21:03,467 --> 01:21:05,674
And people write
what they experience.

986
01:21:06,367 --> 01:21:07,573
...or what they've heard.

987
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:11,780
It's always difficult finding
real solutions in folklore.

988
01:21:13,567 --> 01:21:14,910
But there must be something.

989
01:21:15,601 --> 01:21:19,242
Some weakness. or secret.

990
01:21:20,167 --> 01:21:21,510
..which hasn't been revealed yet.

991
01:21:23,501 --> 01:21:25,503
There is one man who can help us.

992
01:21:28,234 --> 01:21:29,611
When this being attacked
for the first time..

993
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:34,912
..the headman of the village
came to see us and my sir.

994
01:21:35,667 --> 01:21:37,408
I couldn't understand
everything he was saying.

995
01:21:37,467 --> 01:21:39,879
But according to
everything he was saying.

996
01:21:39,934 --> 01:21:42,210
...it clearly indicated that he..

997
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:45,602
...knew about the
Brahma Rakshas' attacks.

998
01:21:47,401 --> 01:21:48,471
Where can we find this man?

999
01:21:49,501 --> 01:21:51,310
It wasn't just a banyan tree.

1000
01:21:51,834 --> 01:21:53,313
It was the villager's deity.

1001
01:21:53,801 --> 01:21:55,644
A deity that protected them.

1002
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:59,178
We tried explaining them,
but they didn't listen.

1003
01:22:00,434 --> 01:22:02,209
Bad luck never comes with a warning.

1004
01:22:03,667 --> 01:22:04,771
They didn't listen.

1005
01:22:06,267 --> 01:22:07,575
They cut down the trees
and built the road..

1006
01:22:07,634 --> 01:22:10,774
"But also paved a
way for the Brahma Rakshah.

1007
01:22:11,567 --> 01:22:13,171
But how can we stop it?

1008
01:22:14,234 --> 01:22:16,339
There must be some way to stop him.

1009
01:22:16,900 --> 01:22:19,813
If we knew why would
we leave our homes?

1010
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:22,341
We've only heard stories.

1011
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:23,274
What stories?

1012
01:22:25,167 --> 01:22:25,770
The same old things.

1013
01:22:27,134 --> 01:22:30,843
Many years ago,
a hunter killed the Brahma Rakshas.

1014
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:32,270
...and saved the people.

1015
01:22:33,367 --> 01:22:34,607
And then people
performed a veneration.

1016
01:22:34,667 --> 01:22:36,271
...and planted that tree there.

1017
01:22:36,434 --> 01:22:38,744
Do you know where
that hunter hailed from?

1018
01:22:39,167 --> 01:22:40,669
Dear, I wasn't even born back then.

1019
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:43,807
It happened 70-75 years ago.

1020
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:45,435
70 years.

1021
01:22:46,667 --> 01:22:48,943
Then possibly he's dead by now.

1022
01:22:51,867 --> 01:22:55,838
Oh yes, he does have a son,
who often paid us a visit.

1023
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:58,905
He was practitioner
of English medicines.

1024
01:22:59,567 --> 01:23:01,547
He used to treat small kids.

1025
01:23:03,667 --> 01:23:04,577
Dr. Moga.

1026
01:23:07,267 --> 01:23:07,904
Yeah!

1027
01:23:08,867 --> 01:23:09,743
Yeah!

1028
01:23:10,801 --> 01:23:12,246
Okay, alright.

1029
01:23:14,234 --> 01:23:16,180
So my students have
shortlisted the names..

1030
01:23:16,234 --> 01:23:17,713
...of two doctors who have
done Masters in child health.

1031
01:23:17,767 --> 01:23:19,440
...and also visit
this area regularly.

1032
01:23:19,834 --> 01:23:22,144
One is Dr. Rakesh Moga,
DCH New Delhi..

1033
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:24,680
...and the other is Dr. Om Moga,
DCH Shimla.

1034
01:23:25,234 --> 01:23:26,838
I think we should
breakup into two teams.

1035
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:28,937
...and visit these places personally.

1036
01:23:29,767 --> 01:23:30,575
Yeah! - Right.

1037
01:23:31,334 --> 01:23:33,780
I was thinking,
Rana and I will go to Delhi.

1038
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:34,640
Right. - Right.

1039
01:23:34,901 --> 01:23:36,608
Kunal and I will go to Shimla.

1040
01:23:36,934 --> 01:23:37,503
Correct.

1041
01:23:54,701 --> 01:23:56,476
Two bottles of water, please.
- Yes Ma'am.

1042
01:23:57,434 --> 01:23:59,744
We're pleased to tell you that.

1043
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:02,747
...Kunal Anand has been rewarded
as best book of the year.

1044
01:24:03,067 --> 01:24:06,241
Yes, before this Kanik
Ray and Rohit Sharma..

1045
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:08,573
...were nominated for this award.

1046
01:24:08,767 --> 01:24:10,075
Come with me. - Where?

1047
01:24:10,634 --> 01:24:11,612
Come on. - But where?

1048
01:24:13,034 --> 01:24:13,774
Watch. - What?

1049
01:24:14,467 --> 01:24:15,810
You'll soon know.

1050
01:24:16,267 --> 01:24:18,804
Kunal Anand is the first
Indian to win this award.

1051
01:24:19,267 --> 01:24:22,578
And he's been given this award.
for his book 'The Golden Sun'.

1052
01:24:22,734 --> 01:24:25,738
Mr. Kunal,
heariest congratulations to you.

1053
01:24:26,067 --> 01:24:27,546
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

1054
01:24:28,201 --> 01:24:30,340
You're the first Indian
to be nominated for this award.

1055
01:24:30,467 --> 01:24:31,639
So how do you feel?

1056
01:24:32,634 --> 01:24:33,840
Obviously I am very happy.

1057
01:24:34,134 --> 01:24:36,375
And I am also feeling very proud..

1058
01:24:36,534 --> 01:24:38,309
...about the fact
that I am an Indian.

1059
01:24:38,434 --> 01:24:41,643
And I would really like to thank
all those people who read my book.

1060
01:24:41,834 --> 01:24:44,371
What was your inspiration
for writing this book?

1061
01:24:45,567 --> 01:24:48,047
Whenever someone writes something
or does any kind of work..

1062
01:24:48,101 --> 01:24:48,602
Who are you?

1063
01:24:48,667 --> 01:24:51,580
He thinks he'll get
handsomely rewarded for it.

1064
01:24:52,034 --> 01:24:52,535
Karan.

1065
01:24:53,034 --> 01:24:55,105
And maybe it's the grace of God..

1066
01:24:55,167 --> 01:24:56,111
Karan Malhotra.

1067
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:00,040
The owner of Malhotra Builders.

1068
01:25:01,667 --> 01:25:02,407
The one..

1069
01:25:02,767 --> 01:25:04,440
You spared your
valuable time for us..

1070
01:25:04,501 --> 01:25:06,139
Responsible for your father's death.

1071
01:25:16,467 --> 01:25:17,775
What happened?

1072
01:25:17,834 --> 01:25:18,642
Who broke these?

1073
01:25:19,700 --> 01:25:21,839
I'm sorry...sorry...

1074
01:25:22,467 --> 01:25:22,842
Ahana..

1075
01:25:23,767 --> 01:25:24,837
Ahana, please.

1076
01:25:25,467 --> 01:25:26,377
Ahana, listen to me.

1077
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:28,245
Just give me a chance to explain.

1078
01:25:30,734 --> 01:25:33,271
Ahana I came here
only to apologies to you.

1079
01:25:33,701 --> 01:25:35,738
I am here so that
I can face you again.

1080
01:25:37,767 --> 01:25:39,440
I never wanted that
all this happened.

1081
01:25:40,634 --> 01:25:41,374
I just.

1082
01:25:42,667 --> 01:25:44,340
I just pressurized him a bit.

1083
01:25:44,601 --> 01:25:46,308
...so that I could buy his land.

1084
01:25:47,534 --> 01:25:49,309
I had returned studying
architecture from London.

1085
01:25:50,467 --> 01:25:52,504
I wanted to prove
many things to my dad.

1086
01:25:54,601 --> 01:25:56,410
But I made a big mistake in haste.

1087
01:25:57,300 --> 01:25:58,745
If I had any idea that.

1088
01:25:59,101 --> 01:26:01,445
...your father would
take such a drastic step"

1089
01:26:02,034 --> 01:26:03,513
"then maybe.. I wouldn't
have been so stubborn.

1090
01:26:04,634 --> 01:26:06,136
Please trust me.

1091
01:26:06,467 --> 01:26:07,172
Trust?

1092
01:26:10,801 --> 01:26:14,408
After meeting you,
I started trusting people again.

1093
01:26:15,767 --> 01:26:18,111
I felt like there are
good people in the world.

1094
01:26:21,267 --> 01:26:23,178
You gave me hope and love.

1095
01:26:26,634 --> 01:26:28,773
I felt like there's
someone in the world..

1096
01:26:29,634 --> 01:26:31,409
..with whom I can spend
the rest of my life.

1097
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:34,179
Someone I can trust.

1098
01:26:35,267 --> 01:26:36,575
But I fell in love..

1099
01:26:38,667 --> 01:26:40,112
...with a man like you.

1100
01:26:42,267 --> 01:26:43,109
Ahana, please..

1101
01:26:43,267 --> 01:26:51,243
"Why do people use
love for selfish means?"

1102
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:59,575
"No one understands
the pain in the heart."

1103
01:27:00,667 --> 01:27:05,446
"So let me live with this pain."

1104
01:27:05,767 --> 01:27:09,271
"I am better alone."

1105
01:27:09,534 --> 01:27:18,613
"Someday this hean
will forsake your memories."

1106
01:27:27,734 --> 01:27:32,274
"So let me live with this pain."

1107
01:27:32,334 --> 01:27:36,077
"I am better alone."

1108
01:27:36,667 --> 01:27:45,178
"Someday this hean
will forsake your memories."

1109
01:27:45,234 --> 01:27:49,080
"Enduring this pain
is better than.."

1110
01:27:49,134 --> 01:27:52,445
"..letting this
separation torment me."

1111
01:27:54,134 --> 01:28:02,019
"Why do people use
love for selfish means?"

1112
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:10,646
"No one understands
the pain in the heart."

1113
01:28:11,467 --> 01:28:16,212
"So let me live with this pain."

1114
01:28:16,501 --> 01:28:19,641
"I am better alone."

1115
01:28:20,367 --> 01:28:29,583
"Someday this hean
will forsake your memories."

1116
01:28:30,334 --> 01:28:31,438
You're on the right track

1117
01:28:31,967 --> 01:28:34,311
Dr. Moga from Delhi spent
his childhood in an orphanage.

1118
01:28:35,467 --> 01:28:36,639
Give it your best try Ahana.

1119
01:28:37,367 --> 01:28:38,345
This is our last chance.

1120
01:28:38,467 --> 01:28:39,207
Okay.

1121
01:28:56,134 --> 01:29:04,076
"Let the dreams shatter,
that's my fate."

1122
01:29:05,034 --> 01:29:12,714
"Let our paths separate,
so what if the pain's too great."

1123
01:29:13,934 --> 01:29:22,410
"Let me endure this pain,
I beg you."

1124
01:29:22,634 --> 01:29:30,576
"Why do people use
love for selfish means?"

1125
01:29:31,467 --> 01:29:39,409
"No one understands
the pain in the heart."

1126
01:29:40,134 --> 01:29:44,674
"So let me live with this pain."

1127
01:29:45,167 --> 01:29:48,410
"I am better alone."

1128
01:29:49,067 --> 01:29:58,317
"Someday this hean
will forsake your memories."

1129
01:30:32,734 --> 01:30:33,735
Are you sure?

1130
01:30:36,034 --> 01:30:38,913
Are you absolutely
sure that you have seen.

1131
01:30:39,834 --> 01:30:41,245
...a Brahma Rakshas?

1132
01:30:41,301 --> 01:30:45,647
Yes. And not just me,
others have seen it too.

1133
01:30:47,034 --> 01:30:48,570
Oh my, God.

1134
01:30:51,634 --> 01:30:52,704
It's killing people.

1135
01:30:53,167 --> 01:30:54,612
And I need to put a stop to this.

1136
01:30:59,000 --> 01:30:59,944
Give me a minute.

1137
01:31:12,301 --> 01:31:15,180
My father documented
his entire journey..

1138
01:31:15,234 --> 01:31:16,975
...to fight the Brahma Rakshas.

1139
01:31:17,700 --> 01:31:19,145
This album contains photographs.

1140
01:31:19,234 --> 01:31:21,680
..taken by his friend and
photographer, Krishnan Verman..

1141
01:31:22,034 --> 01:31:23,377
...whom he took along.

1142
01:31:24,201 --> 01:31:25,942
I've heard that Brahma Rakshas.

1143
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:28,305
...are a result of
Lord Brahma's curse.

1144
01:31:29,567 --> 01:31:32,878
So only Lord Brahma
can help you get rid of it.

1145
01:31:35,367 --> 01:31:36,971
Do you see this temple?

1146
01:31:37,734 --> 01:31:39,008
This temple is in Pushkar.

1147
01:31:39,367 --> 01:31:42,644
This is the only temple
of Brahma in the entire world.

1148
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:44,938
Now listen carefully.

1149
01:31:45,834 --> 01:31:49,714
Just like Ravan could be
killed by striking at his naval.

1150
01:31:50,067 --> 01:31:53,913
Dushashan could be defeated
by striking on his thigh.

1151
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:56,874
And Brahmasur could
be killed by making him.

1152
01:31:56,934 --> 01:32:00,143
...place his right hand on himself,
similarly..

1153
01:32:00,967 --> 01:32:02,105
...Brahma Rakshas can be killed..

1154
01:32:03,267 --> 01:32:07,044
...by weapons dipped in the water
of this Brahmakund.

1155
01:32:10,101 --> 01:32:13,708
But the weapon can
only be immersed.

1156
01:32:13,767 --> 01:32:15,610
...on the night of
the auspicious Full moon.

1157
01:32:16,134 --> 01:32:20,173
My father had 30 bullets
of an old single-barrel rifle..

1158
01:32:20,234 --> 01:32:21,645
..which he had dipped in that water.

1159
01:32:21,900 --> 01:32:23,607
Even though he had a weapon..

1160
01:32:24,601 --> 01:32:27,309
...it was difficult to
control the Brahma Rakshas.

1161
01:32:28,867 --> 01:32:32,747
Somehow my father managed
to kill the Brahma Rakshas.

1162
01:32:33,334 --> 01:32:36,008
..but he lost his three friends.

1163
01:32:37,567 --> 01:32:40,013
And used 23 bullets.

1164
01:32:41,100 --> 01:32:45,742
I have still kept
those 7 bullets safely.

1165
01:32:46,700 --> 01:32:50,580
Now that gun and bullets
will be useful to you.

1166
01:32:55,234 --> 01:32:58,238
7 bullets and one old gun.

1167
01:32:59,734 --> 01:33:02,715
Do you think it will be enough
to kill that Brahma Rakshas?

1168
01:33:02,967 --> 01:33:05,914
I mean, they had 30 bullets.

1169
01:33:07,234 --> 01:33:09,043
...yet only one survived.

1170
01:33:10,234 --> 01:33:11,804
We'll have to be
determined to kill him.

1171
01:33:12,001 --> 01:33:13,912
Otherwise even 7 or
30 bullets won't be enough.

1172
01:33:14,134 --> 01:33:16,045
If that's the case,
then why don't we go to Pushkar?

1173
01:33:16,667 --> 01:33:18,010
New weapons, new bullets.

1174
01:33:18,067 --> 01:33:20,013
The auspicious full
moon is 11 months away.

1175
01:33:20,267 --> 01:33:21,871
And I have just 4 days.

1176
01:33:22,267 --> 01:33:26,716
I admit we have just 7 bullets,
but we'll have to take a chance.

1177
01:33:29,201 --> 01:33:30,202
So how do we do this?

1178
01:33:30,934 --> 01:33:31,935
Do we wait for him?

1179
01:33:34,101 --> 01:33:34,875
No.

1180
01:33:36,034 --> 01:33:37,035
We'll go to him.

1181
01:34:11,301 --> 01:34:13,247
I'll head this way with my torch.

1182
01:34:14,300 --> 01:34:15,438
Ahana, you..

1183
01:34:17,267 --> 01:34:18,769
...head that way with your torch.

1184
01:34:19,767 --> 01:34:21,872
Scared by the fire
he'll come out this way.

1185
01:34:23,034 --> 01:34:23,705
You..

1186
01:34:26,801 --> 01:34:28,337
Stand there with your gun.

1187
01:34:30,467 --> 01:34:32,242
As soon as he comes just shoot him.

1188
01:34:33,834 --> 01:34:34,812
But remember one thing.

1189
01:34:34,867 --> 01:34:37,040
...you can fire only one
bullet at a time with this gun.

1190
01:34:38,734 --> 01:34:39,610
You have just one chance.

1191
01:34:41,467 --> 01:34:42,002
Alright?

1192
01:34:42,667 --> 01:34:43,771
Okay, yeah.

1193
01:41:32,867 --> 01:41:33,436
Come on, Ahana.

1194
01:41:33,767 --> 01:41:34,711
Hurry up. Quickly.

1195
01:41:34,767 --> 01:41:35,336
Come on.

1196
01:41:38,801 --> 01:41:39,677
Come on.

1197
01:41:46,300 --> 01:41:47,779
Go.. go..

1198
01:42:13,101 --> 01:42:14,171
Let's go, quick.

1199
01:42:51,300 --> 01:42:52,108
Karan.

1200
01:42:52,734 --> 01:42:53,371
Karan.

1201
01:43:52,734 --> 01:43:53,940
Why are you doing this?

1202
01:43:54,700 --> 01:43:57,112
Earlier, it was to alleviate
the burden on my hean.

1203
01:43:59,534 --> 01:44:01,571
Now I'm doing it because
my head's made me helpless.

1204
01:44:15,034 --> 01:44:20,450
"I am close to you again."

1205
01:44:21,334 --> 01:44:26,716
"I'm fortunate to
have this moment again."

1206
01:44:28,201 --> 01:44:33,480
"Looking at you has
made me lively again."

1207
01:44:33,634 --> 01:44:36,672
"How do I explain my heart."

1208
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:40,447
"..that now I am your past?"

1209
01:44:40,967 --> 01:44:46,610
"This is the only moment we have."

1210
01:44:47,334 --> 01:44:53,182
"This is the only moment we have."

1211
01:44:53,634 --> 01:44:58,743
"This is the only moment we have."

1212
01:45:00,134 --> 01:45:04,139
"This is the only moment we have."

1213
01:45:04,201 --> 01:45:07,045
"I want to live it."

1214
01:45:35,367 --> 01:45:40,441
"My words are concealed."

1215
01:45:40,967 --> 01:45:46,076
"..because you're in front of me."

1216
01:45:48,134 --> 01:45:53,243
"The head's looking for.."

1217
01:45:53,534 --> 01:45:58,381
"..the love that once
existed between us."

1218
01:46:00,167 --> 01:46:06,516
"I pray that you come back to me.."

1219
01:46:06,567 --> 01:46:12,415
"..and say that you
want to be with me."

1220
01:46:12,967 --> 01:46:19,509
"if possible don't ever forget me."

1221
01:46:20,134 --> 01:46:25,311
"This is the only moment we have."

1222
01:46:26,501 --> 01:46:31,280
"This is the only moment we have."

1223
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:37,676
"This is the only moment we have."

1224
01:46:39,301 --> 01:46:44,649
"This is the only moment we have."

1225
01:47:21,334 --> 01:47:22,779
Only three bullets left.

1226
01:47:23,334 --> 01:47:26,008
Three bullets might be inadequate
to kill him in his lair.

1227
01:47:27,134 --> 01:47:28,943
But if he comes here..

1228
01:47:29,701 --> 01:47:30,873
..then three bullets
are enough to kill him.

1229
01:47:31,767 --> 01:47:33,178
I know this place better than him.

1230
01:47:33,801 --> 01:47:35,337
If I manage to draw
him here.. - You?

1231
01:47:36,867 --> 01:47:37,311
Why not us?

1232
01:47:37,368 --> 01:47:38,972
Because you're leaving, Karan.

1233
01:47:40,900 --> 01:47:42,004
This fight is mine.

1234
01:47:43,234 --> 01:47:44,941
I want to fight it alone.

1235
01:47:51,167 --> 01:47:51,975
And what about the battle..

1236
01:47:52,034 --> 01:47:53,445
...that I've been
fighting with myself?

1237
01:47:55,167 --> 01:47:57,272
You think I'm doing you a favor.

1238
01:47:58,867 --> 01:48:01,211
No, I need to kill
that Brahma Rakshas.

1239
01:48:01,268 --> 01:48:03,475
...to slay the demon inside me.

1240
01:48:05,700 --> 01:48:07,338
And if you snatch
my motive from me..

1241
01:48:09,067 --> 01:48:10,740
...that what will be the
difference between you and me?

1242
01:48:12,934 --> 01:48:13,378
Okay.

1243
01:48:15,934 --> 01:48:16,935
But on one condition.

1244
01:48:19,467 --> 01:48:20,844
If we survive..

1245
01:48:23,100 --> 01:48:24,909
...then you won't show
me your face again.

1246
01:48:26,767 --> 01:48:27,802
You will go far away.

1247
01:52:50,600 --> 01:52:51,408
Ahana, what.

1248
01:56:16,534 --> 01:56:17,444
Ahana.

1249
01:56:18,467 --> 01:56:20,947
Ahana come out.

1250
01:56:22,067 --> 01:56:22,875
Let's go.

1251
01:56:33,601 --> 01:56:34,443
I dropped the bullet.

1252
01:56:34,834 --> 01:56:35,676
I don't know where.

1253
01:56:35,934 --> 01:56:36,878
Come on let's go.

1254
01:56:37,534 --> 01:56:39,878
But when.. where? Think.

1255
01:56:41,801 --> 01:56:42,541
Run!

1256
01:56:46,634 --> 01:56:47,578
Where's the bullet?

1257
01:56:48,367 --> 01:56:50,574
Last time I loaded the gun
in the dining room.

1258
01:56:50,734 --> 01:56:52,441
It could've fallen in the
kitchen or even somewhere outside.

1259
01:56:52,500 --> 01:56:52,978
Outside?

1260
01:56:53,101 --> 01:56:55,513
It's a damn big area to search.
- We'll have to find out.

1261
01:56:55,934 --> 01:56:56,878
Come on let's go.

1262
01:57:01,634 --> 01:57:03,011
There's just one way now.

1263
01:57:03,667 --> 01:57:05,078
One of us will distract him.

1264
01:57:05,567 --> 01:57:07,513
...and the other will look for
the bullet inside.

1265
01:57:07,767 --> 01:57:08,802
I'll do the first task"

1266
01:57:09,001 --> 01:57:10,708
...because he came her
smelling my blood.

1267
01:57:10,900 --> 01:57:11,674
No.

1268
01:57:12,001 --> 01:57:12,979
I won't leave you alone.

1269
01:57:13,034 --> 01:57:15,446
If we stay together, we'll both die.

1270
01:57:15,667 --> 01:57:17,305
You will have to go. Please.

1271
01:57:17,434 --> 01:57:19,345
But how will you distract him
until I am back?

1272
02:00:48,167 --> 02:00:49,077
Ahana!

1273
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,071
Karan!

1274
02:03:01,968 --> 02:03:04,812
Mr. Raman.
Mr. Rawat. Such a pleasure.

1275
02:03:05,334 --> 02:03:07,610
Ma'am, you were truly wonderful.

1276
02:03:07,767 --> 02:03:09,178
You've managed to turn
everything around..

1277
02:03:09,234 --> 02:03:10,110
...in just ten days.

1278
02:03:10,301 --> 02:03:11,075
Impressive.

1279
02:03:11,201 --> 02:03:12,680
Mr. Rawat. - Yes.

1280
02:03:12,734 --> 02:03:14,077
On behalf of our bank.

1281
02:03:14,667 --> 02:03:16,408
Thank you.. but, this is for you.

1282
02:03:16,634 --> 02:03:17,908
What's this, ma'am?

1283
02:03:17,967 --> 02:03:22,416
This is a cheque for Rs 76,
80,115.45!

1284
02:03:23,800 --> 02:03:25,108
We didn't understand, ma'am.

1285
02:03:25,701 --> 02:03:27,203
Para 5 clause 14.

1286
02:03:27,267 --> 02:03:31,181
It clearly states that, if I return
your money with interest.

1287
02:03:31,301 --> 02:03:33,941
"Then, you won't have any
control over my property.

1288
02:03:35,967 --> 02:03:37,037
But, ma'am..

1289
02:03:37,100 --> 02:03:39,011
Axis Bank thinks
I'm a great investment.

1290
02:03:39,068 --> 02:03:40,945
And other than your loan amount.

1291
02:03:41,001 --> 02:03:43,106
"They've sanctioned
my 100 million loan.

1292
02:03:43,768 --> 02:03:46,248
So now you guys get the hell out
of my property.

1293
02:03:46,400 --> 02:03:47,276
And stay out.

1294
02:03:48,634 --> 02:03:49,169
Ma'am.

1295
02:04:05,200 --> 02:04:06,702
It's the opening of your hotel.

1296
02:04:07,800 --> 02:04:09,973
I thought if your musicians
are late again..

1297
02:04:10,800 --> 02:04:13,041
..then you might need this
novice singer.

1298
02:04:22,234 --> 02:04:23,406
You promised..

1299
02:04:24,701 --> 02:04:26,112
...that you'll never come back again.

1300
02:04:27,834 --> 02:04:29,814
If I had kept my promise,
my hean would've shattered.

1301
02:04:32,301 --> 02:04:34,303
So, to save my hean
I broke my promise.

1302
02:04:36,668 --> 02:04:38,306
Ahana, love me, hate me..

1303
02:04:40,401 --> 02:04:41,641
But please forgive me.

1304
02:04:54,234 --> 02:04:55,110
And you know what.

1305
02:04:57,734 --> 02:04:59,270
...Kunal Anand is a s**t writer.

1306
02:05:16,368 --> 02:05:23,047
"Shower me with your love,
the monsoon's here."

1307
02:05:24,934 --> 02:05:31,112
"It's the time for us to meet."

1308
02:05:33,600 --> 02:05:39,175
"Shower me with your love,
the monsoon's here."

1309
02:05:39,234 --> 02:05:45,207
"It's the time for us to meet."

1310
02:05:45,934 --> 02:05:47,242
"I want to hide you from everyone."

1311
02:05:47,301 --> 02:05:48,803
"..and take you in my arms."

1312
02:05:48,867 --> 02:05:51,677
"I want to cross all limits.
In your love."

1313
02:05:51,734 --> 02:05:56,979
"It's the first time I feel
such immense love."

1314
02:06:08,067 --> 02:06:13,745
"Shower me with your love,
the monsoon's here."

1315
02:06:13,834 --> 02:06:19,409
"It's the time for us to meet."

1316
02:06:37,734 --> 02:06:43,241
"Why can't I endure
a moment of separation?"

1317
02:06:43,401 --> 02:06:49,147
"Why don't you dwell in
my breath each morning?"

1318
02:06:49,201 --> 02:06:54,913
"Come closer to me,
I'll shower you with love."

1319
02:06:55,034 --> 02:07:00,746
"I've spent many sleepless nights,
waiting for you."

1320
02:07:01,301 --> 02:07:06,046
"How do I express my feelings?"

1321
02:07:06,100 --> 02:07:11,846
"I love you more than myself."

1322
02:07:17,167 --> 02:07:20,080
"Forsake everything
and come to me.."

1323
02:07:20,200 --> 02:07:22,908
"..the monsoon's here."

1324
02:07:22,967 --> 02:07:28,747
"It's the time for us to meet."

1325
02:07:29,667 --> 02:07:30,668
"I want to hide you from everyone."

1326
02:07:30,734 --> 02:07:32,338
"..and take you in my arms."

1327
02:07:32,401 --> 02:07:35,245
"I want to cross all limits.
In your love."

1328
02:07:35,301 --> 02:07:41,343
"It's the first time
I feel such immense love."
