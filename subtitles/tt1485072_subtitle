Right? - Right.

92
00:07:06,172 --> 00:07:07,537

DJ, why are you playing
these hymns?

106
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,584
Play something worthwhile
and modern.

107

Sorry. Mrs. Lobo asked
me to play this music.

108

Mrs. Lobo has gone upstairs
to the terrace.

00:07:57,891 --> 00:07:59,791
Ok, at your own risk.

110

Stop the music! Stop that music!

117

Who asked you to play that
music? - That boy.

118
00:08:29,422 --> 00:08:30,753
That brown jacket. - Hey, you!

119

Catch him.

126
00:08:50,143 --> 00:08:52,111
Who are you? Which school

We are its people, it is
our bouquet. - What?

00:09:08,428 --> 00:09:10,828
Ok. ..beautiful nation.
- Ok, ok.

131

We are letting you go as this

lf l see you again in my school,
l'll have you arrested.

133
00:09:23,743 --> 00:09:25,472
Where did these three boys go?

134
00:09:27,347 --> 00:09:29,144
Were you thrashed
for punishment?

135
00:09:29,315 --> 00:09:31,647
No; they just made me sing a
patriotic song and let me go.

136
00:09:31,784 --> 00:09:34,810
You didn't have to suffer
much then. - Surely.

137
00:09:36,222 --> 00:09:37,849
You didn't tell me your name.

138
00:09:38,224 --> 00:09:40,522
For what? - l want to know.

139
00:09:41,094 --> 00:09:43,153
Are you in a hurry? - Yes.

140
00:09:43,329 --> 00:09:45,729
Leave me to my house. l'll tell
you when we get there.

141
00:09:45,798 --> 00:09:48,358
But.. - lf you are
afraid, let it be.

142
00:09:48,668 --> 00:09:50,363
Me scared? - Come on then.

143
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:51,764
Ok. Let's go.

144
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:56,331

Come on.

149
00:10:17,497 --> 00:10:20,364
Wow! lt's fantabulous.

150
00:10:21,301 --> 00:10:24,134
You have such a big house.

151
00:10:24,337 --> 00:10:26,897
You can have three rooms of
ours in this much space.

152
00:10:27,373 --> 00:10:28,704
There is a pool too!

153
00:10:29,742 --> 00:10:31,334
You are so lucky, friend.

154
00:10:31,744 --> 00:10:35,180
What if it is big? l have to
roam around alone in the house..

155
00:10:35,281 --> 00:10:37,272
..like crazy and get bored.

156
00:10:37,417 --> 00:10:39,248
Why? Don't your friends
come here?

157
00:10:40,253 --> 00:10:42,312
l'd never call them. They
keep showing off..

158
00:10:42,388 --> 00:10:44,151
..bitching about others
or they say..

159
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:47,157
Oh! That actor has
such sexy biceps.

160
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,453
Then they crack dirty jokes.

161
00:10:49,595 --> 00:10:53,497
But dirty jokes are funny.
Don't you like them?

162
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,691
Not all, just some.
You know them?

163
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:59,934
l don't know jokes but l
know to make a drawing.

164
00:11:00,173 --> 00:11:01,697
Tell me then. - Yes..

165
00:11:02,608 --> 00:11:04,838
lt's very naughty though. Don't
complain after that.

166
00:11:05,378 --> 00:11:08,643
Alright. -Ok, l need
a paper this big.

167
00:11:08,748 --> 00:11:10,511

Go on. Cut the cake.

174
00:11:59,465 --> 00:12:00,864
No, no! - Eat it.

175
00:12:07,874 --> 00:12:11,503
Where do you live? - Near the
vegetable market. Berivalan.

176
00:12:12,412 --> 00:12:13,777
Who else lives with you?

177
00:12:14,113 --> 00:12:16,172
lt's just me and my parents.

178
00:12:18,117 --> 00:12:20,176
There are three rooms in
such a small place?

179
00:12:20,787 --> 00:12:23,517
What do you mean? - You said..

180
00:12:23,823 --> 00:12:27,224
..three rooms of yours could
fit into our hall.

181
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:30,328
No, we don't have three rooms.

182
00:12:30,496 --> 00:12:32,657
We stay in one room
with difficulty.

183
00:12:33,499 --> 00:12:35,433
What do you mean by
'with difficulty'?

184
00:12:35,635 --> 00:12:38,502
l mean, we have problems
about using the loo..

185
00:12:38,671 --> 00:12:40,468
..in the morning and for the
TV remote in the evening.

186
00:12:40,606 --> 00:12:42,403
Sometimes an entire day
passes by laughing..

187
00:12:42,508 --> 00:12:44,203
..and sometimes as fighting.

188
00:12:46,412 --> 00:12:47,879
Come on. Do the drawing.

189
00:12:48,781 --> 00:12:50,681
Drawing? - The one you
were going to make.

190
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,685
A naughty drawing. -Yes but
it will really be naughty.

191
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,583
Don't hit me later. -Ok.

192
00:12:58,925 --> 00:13:02,486
Ok. lmagine a teacher teaching
small kids to draw.

193
00:13:03,129 --> 00:13:06,098
There's your teacher, Mrs. Lobo.

194
00:13:06,265 --> 00:13:09,325
Mrs. Lobo wants to see the
children's creativity.

195
00:13:09,635 --> 00:13:13,093
She makes a line
like this. This.

196
00:13:13,473 --> 00:13:15,464
She says that this
is a worm. A worm.

197
00:13:15,741 --> 00:13:18,801
She asks the kids to come ahead
and continue the drawing.

198
00:13:19,112 --> 00:13:21,342
A kid comes ahead and makes
a line like this.

199
00:13:21,447 --> 00:13:24,109
He says that this is a female
worm. Mrs. Worm.

200
00:13:24,817 --> 00:13:26,842
Then another kid comes and
makes a line like this.

201
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,248
A table. Then this.
Chinese lantern.

202
00:13:30,756 --> 00:13:33,623
Then another line like this.

203
00:13:34,127 --> 00:13:35,458
This becomes a table stand.

204
00:13:35,561 --> 00:13:38,189
Then a kid comes and makes
a line like this.

205
00:13:38,498 --> 00:13:40,489
Electric bulb? - Wow! Very good.

206
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,133
Then this.. a jug.

207
00:13:44,704 --> 00:13:46,729
And this is a flower vase.

208
00:13:47,507 --> 00:13:50,738
A small kid is standing on
one side and looking.

209
00:13:51,144 --> 00:13:53,669
Mrs. Lobo asks him to come ahead
and do the drawing too.

210
00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:59,684
The boy comes ahead and
makes a line like this.

211
00:13:59,852 --> 00:14:01,752
What is this? - Mrs. Lobo
asks that too.

212
00:14:01,854 --> 00:14:05,813
What is this? The boy says that
a lady is changing her panties.

213
00:14:07,326 --> 00:14:10,090
How is that? -Mrs. Lobo
asks the same question.

214
00:14:10,263 --> 00:14:13,096
The boy turns the drawing
around, like this.

215
00:14:15,668 --> 00:14:17,465
l told you, didn't l? - Naughty!

216
00:14:18,137 --> 00:14:20,605
Don't hit me! - Naughty!

217
00:14:20,773 --> 00:14:22,604
l told you it would be naughty.
You want me to hit you too?

218
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:25,176
You can't hit me. lt's
my birthday today, ok?

219
00:14:26,145 --> 00:14:28,807
You aren't a duffer as you
thought you would be.

220
00:14:29,248 --> 00:14:30,772
Thank you. - You are welcome.

221
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:34,848
Do you know why l am
so happy today?

222
00:14:35,121 --> 00:14:37,316
Yes. lt is your birthday today.

223
00:14:39,158 --> 00:14:41,683
lt is because l am not alone
on my birthday today.

224
00:15:11,157 --> 00:15:12,249
Here we are.

225
00:15:14,594 --> 00:15:16,152
Robin! Get the bags out.

226
00:15:16,762 --> 00:15:18,559
Sir? Madam? -Come on, move it.

227
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:20,495
Oh God! - Robin!

228
00:15:21,234 --> 00:15:24,203
Suzy, the master has
come with his wife.

229
00:15:24,303 --> 00:15:26,703
Oh God! Get up! My
parents have come!

230
00:15:26,806 --> 00:15:28,501
Run away quickly! - Oh my God!

231
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:30,369
God! -Suzy!

232
00:15:31,444 --> 00:15:33,878
Run! Get out quickly! -Suzy!

233
00:15:34,247 --> 00:15:36,181
Robin, Suzy. -Sir!

234
00:15:37,617 --> 00:15:39,812
Why are you screaming? - No
sir. l wasn't screaming.

235
00:15:40,586 --> 00:15:42,144
But you didn't tell
me your name.

236
00:15:42,221 --> 00:15:44,189
Forget the name. Flee
now quickly.

237
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,324
How is Maahi? - She's sleeping.

238
00:15:46,425 --> 00:15:48,723
Don't worry. l'm not going
to wake her up.

239
00:15:49,629 --> 00:15:52,257
Why are you following
me? - Sorry.

240
00:15:52,798 --> 00:15:55,198
Go on and make tea for
me. - Yes madam.

241
00:16:45,718 --> 00:16:47,117
Good morning.

242
00:16:48,587 --> 00:16:51,488
Good morning. - Good
morning, mother.

243
00:16:52,792 --> 00:16:54,726
You were smiling a
lot in your sleep.

244
00:16:56,462 --> 00:16:57,827
What did you dream about?

245
00:16:58,297 --> 00:17:00,697
Nothing. My vacation has begun.

246
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:03,563
So l thought we both
could have some fun.

247
00:17:06,105 --> 00:17:07,333
l'm sorry, dear.

248
00:17:08,407 --> 00:17:11,342
Even this year l can't go with
you to spend holidays.

249
00:17:11,711 --> 00:17:15,078
But why, mother?
- What can l do?

250
00:17:16,115 --> 00:17:19,778
Your father has a bar council
association meeting in London.

251
00:17:20,586 --> 00:17:22,247
People come there in couples.

252
00:17:22,788 --> 00:17:24,722
l'll have to go. You
know that, right?

253
00:17:27,426 --> 00:17:30,361
Don't worry. We'll be back
by New Year time.

254
00:17:30,463 --> 00:17:31,555
Ok. - Ok?

255
00:17:33,165 --> 00:17:35,099
We returned late last night.

256
00:17:35,301 --> 00:17:38,099
That is why l wish you a
belated happy birthday.

257
00:17:38,871 --> 00:17:40,236
Thank you mother.

258
00:17:41,407 --> 00:17:43,637
l have got a gift for you also.

259
00:17:45,478 --> 00:17:46,536
Here.

260
00:17:49,115 --> 00:17:51,379
Wow! A credit card? -l
love you, mother!

261
00:17:53,386 --> 00:17:55,581
Now you can buy whatever
you wish to.

262
00:17:56,789 --> 00:17:58,757
Make sure no one cheats
you though.

263
00:17:58,858 --> 00:18:01,258
No one can cheat me,
mother. Thank you!

264
00:18:03,596 --> 00:18:05,257
Bring that around son. Give
me one of those bags.

265
00:18:05,364 --> 00:18:06,763
No mother. lt's alright.

266
00:18:07,133 --> 00:18:10,296
My son takes good care of me.

267
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:13,671
What are you doing,
mother? Am l a kid?

268
00:18:13,739 --> 00:18:16,731
You will always be a
kid for me, my son.

269
00:18:17,243 --> 00:18:19,211
Mother! Everyone is looking.

270
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:21,671
You cause me to be embarrassed.

271
00:18:23,282 --> 00:18:25,477
You have changed in
one night's time.

272
00:18:30,456 --> 00:18:32,321
Your father. -Mrs. Sushma..

273
00:18:32,525 --> 00:18:34,550
..are you getting a month's
stock or for an entire year?

274
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,560
lt's good that you came.
Keep the goods.

275
00:18:36,662 --> 00:18:38,459
My son has been carrying a
load since a long time.

276
00:18:38,531 --> 00:18:40,192
He won't get injured
through that.

277
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:41,596
The lazybones is getting
some exercise.

278
00:18:41,734 --> 00:18:44,100
He only eats, plays and watches
movies during the day.

279
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,464
During the night he stays
out of the house.

280
00:18:45,571 --> 00:18:47,266
Where were you all through
last night?

281
00:18:47,373 --> 00:18:51,207
Listen! He was late as he was
doing homework with friends.

282
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:53,369
Mrs. Sushma, if l stay out
or if l return home late..

283
00:18:53,512 --> 00:18:55,241
..will it be fine with you?

284
00:18:55,414 --> 00:18:57,780
The worthless boy wastes
time with spoilt boys.

285
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:00,182
What is it? Couldn't
you call us once?

286
00:19:00,252 --> 00:19:02,186
l didn't have a mobile phone
to make you a call.

287
00:19:02,288 --> 00:19:04,051
l'll get you one, the latest.

288
00:19:04,156 --> 00:19:06,056
Sushma, don't pamper him.

289
00:19:06,192 --> 00:19:08,319
l drive six-seven rickshaws
on hire.

290
00:19:08,427 --> 00:19:10,486
l even drive them on Saturday
and Sunday..

291
00:19:10,596 --> 00:19:11,756
..but l don't earn as much
as this boy squanders.

292
00:19:12,064 --> 00:19:13,258
So, before a mobile
was invented..

293
00:19:13,332 --> 00:19:15,197
..didn't people call and
inform their household?

294
00:19:15,334 --> 00:19:18,599
Listen, from where did you
get this fashionable wear?

295
00:19:18,737 --> 00:19:20,671
lt's yours, dad. - Yes.
They're yours.

296
00:19:20,773 --> 00:19:22,798
Mine? lf it's mine, why
have you worn it?

297
00:19:23,075 --> 00:19:24,736
lt was because they didn't
fit you anymore.

298
00:19:24,844 --> 00:19:27,677
l could wear it again if l
became thin in future, right?

299
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,681
You shouldn't be thin!
Why should you be?

300
00:19:31,116 --> 00:19:32,640
Come, keep the goods.

301
00:19:32,751 --> 00:19:35,242
Our son has become intelligent
and grown up.

302
00:19:35,721 --> 00:19:37,120
Yes, l know that.

303
00:19:37,189 --> 00:19:40,181
Look, you can fool your mother
but not me, understand?

304
00:19:40,526 --> 00:19:42,824
Drop us first and then leave.

305
00:19:43,229 --> 00:19:47,495
l don't know about him but l
won't ever leave you Sushma.

306
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:50,294
Look, the fool is
laughing at me.

307
00:19:50,402 --> 00:19:52,734
He's not laughing.
His face is jolly.

308
00:19:53,572 --> 00:19:55,437
Mother! What are you doing?

309
00:19:55,508 --> 00:19:56,702
Why are you complaining to her?

310
00:19:56,809 --> 00:19:58,401
The number if kisses
you get everyday..

311
00:19:58,511 --> 00:20:01,742
Even if l were to get a percent
of that, l would be overjoyed.

312
00:20:02,581 --> 00:20:04,378
Move! Go on now!

313
00:20:05,251 --> 00:20:07,685
Really!

314
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:13,883
Here.

315
00:20:16,695 --> 00:20:17,821
Excuse me.

316
00:20:18,664 --> 00:20:20,825
ls your breakfast
over? - Yes papa.

317
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,492
Good.

318
00:20:23,135 --> 00:20:25,603
Show me what you have learnt
on the piano till now.

319
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:47,550
Go on.

320
00:21:03,709 --> 00:21:06,337
Wait, wait. What is this?
What are you playing?

321
00:21:07,746 --> 00:21:10,112
What are you playing?
What are these cords?

322
00:21:10,316 --> 00:21:11,749
Doesn't your piano teacher
come here these days?

323
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:13,340
She does come, papa.

324
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:16,386
What then? Have you studied only
that much all these days?

325
00:21:20,192 --> 00:21:22,126
You really disappoint me, Maahi.

326
00:21:24,363 --> 00:21:26,558
You don't concentrate
on things these days.

327
00:21:26,832 --> 00:21:28,823
Not on studies, on learning
the piano..

328
00:21:29,168 --> 00:21:30,726
What do you do the whole time?

329
00:21:32,204 --> 00:21:34,263
Phaki, l'm not scolding her.
l'm talking to her.

330
00:21:34,373 --> 00:21:36,466
l'm explaining it to her.
Now she isn't a kid.

331
00:21:36,575 --> 00:21:38,202
She should be responsible.

332
00:21:38,911 --> 00:21:40,378
We have had her take
so many lessons.

333
00:21:40,479 --> 00:21:42,504
French, piano, dance..
what is the point?

334
00:21:42,615 --> 00:21:44,583
l didn't ask you to arrange
for lessons.

335
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:45,908
Sorry.

336
00:21:47,252 --> 00:21:48,344
What did you say?

337
00:21:50,222 --> 00:21:51,689
Come on, say it again please.

338
00:21:53,158 --> 00:21:55,149
Your mind is getting
out of hand.

339
00:21:55,394 --> 00:21:58,454
All the research and analysis
that you read in magazines..

340
00:21:58,664 --> 00:22:00,632
lt says that children are misled
as parents don't have time.

341
00:22:00,733 --> 00:22:03,668
Children may have complex as
parents don't love them..Bullshit!

342
00:22:05,104 --> 00:22:06,662
What don't you have?

343
00:22:07,673 --> 00:22:10,198
You have a nice house and many

How many people get such a
big and expensive piano?

345
00:22:13,746 --> 00:22:15,771
She just moves around with
her face hanging low.

00:22:15,848 --> 00:22:17,110
Come on.

347
00:22:17,549 --> 00:22:19,312

Don't ever talk back
to me again. Ok?

349
00:22:25,891 --> 00:22:27,290
Spoilt brat.

Why did you take so
long to call me?

352
00:22:48,547 --> 00:22:50,276
lt was just that l was delayed.

May l come there? - No!

00:23:04,563 --> 00:23:07,157
There are only boys here
playing in shorts.

360
00:23:07,332 --> 00:23:08,765
So what? l'm coming.

361

00:23:28,687 --> 00:23:30,382
Let her score a goal.

Yes! Goal!

366
00:23:45,204 --> 00:23:47,695
Listen now, listen

00:23:48,273 --> 00:23:50,867
Listen now, listen

eat a yoghurt delicacy.

369
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,138
The dish should be made
hot with pepper.

370
00:23:56,215 --> 00:23:57,614
Chandni Chowk is before me.

371
00:23:57,716 --> 00:23:59,206
l flew a kite on
Chandni Chowk.

372
00:23:59,318 --> 00:24:00,649
lt was cut and fell
in Darya Ganj.

373
00:24:00,753 --> 00:24:02,277
There was a tent
in Darya Ganj.

374
00:24:02,387 --> 00:24:03,786
There was Delhi
Kent beyond it.

375

376
00:24:05,491 --> 00:24:07,083
The Qutub comes after this.

00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:08,558
There were flowers in Bharoli.

378
00:24:08,627 --> 00:24:10,151
Madhav and Maqbool met there.

379
00:24:10,262 --> 00:24:13,095
Everything is cool, brother.
Everything is cool.

380
00:24:17,836 --> 00:24:19,463
Oh baby, baby!

381
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:24,166
Behind the Red fort and
below the Qutub..

382
00:24:24,309 --> 00:24:27,107
..we will enjoy ourselves
and dance.

383
00:24:27,479 --> 00:24:30,471
The streets of Delhi 6.
The pretty girls here.

384
00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:33,416
Take them away in your heart.

385

The streets of Delhi 6.
The pretty girls here.

00:24:43,195 --> 00:24:46,130
Take them away in your heart.

389
00:24:46,265 --> 00:24:49,325
Behind the Red fort and
below the Qutub..

390
00:24:49,434 --> 00:24:52,301
..we will enjoy ourselves
and dance.

391
00:24:57,176 --> 00:24:58,609
Oh baby, baby!

392
00:25:20,499 --> 00:25:23,491
We have youthful vigour.
We will gyrate.

393
00:25:23,602 --> 00:25:26,730
We will move about till
we are conscious.

394
00:25:27,105 --> 00:25:29,733
We may be late. Come along.

395
00:25:30,142 --> 00:25:32,872
Let's go to lndia
Gate. Come along.

396
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:34,677
Jantar Mantar and Karol Baug.

397

CPGK, run quickly.

398
00:25:36,481 --> 00:25:37,880
From Gurgaon to
the civil line.

399
00:25:38,116 --> 00:25:39,811
Now the entire Delhi is mine.

400
00:25:45,724 --> 00:25:48,818
Behind the Red fort and
below the Qutub..

401
00:25:48,894 --> 00:25:51,795
..we will enjoy ourselves
and dance.

402
00:25:52,197 --> 00:25:55,132
The streets of Delhi 6.
The pretty girls here.

403
00:25:55,267 --> 00:25:58,293
Take them away in your heart.

404
00:26:09,181 --> 00:26:10,580
Oh baby, baby!

405
00:26:10,682 --> 00:26:13,674
We will go to the
fried bread lane.

406
00:26:14,086 --> 00:26:16,748
We'll eat fried bread
stuff with potatoes.

407
00:26:17,189 --> 00:26:20,090
There is excitement in my
heart in every moment.

408
00:26:20,292 --> 00:26:23,090
There is no force on me ever.

409
00:26:23,362 --> 00:26:26,456
Local delicacies
are enjoyable.

410
00:26:26,598 --> 00:26:28,156
The entire area is aromatic..

411
00:26:28,267 --> 00:26:30,167
..when a street snack
hits my mouth.

412
00:26:31,303 --> 00:26:34,329
Behind the Red fort and
below the Qutub..

413
00:26:34,406 --> 00:26:37,375
..we will enjoy ourselves
and dance.

414
00:26:42,147 --> 00:26:43,444
Oh baby, baby!

415
00:26:44,416 --> 00:26:47,214
You play around all day. Don't
your parents scold you?

416
00:26:47,352 --> 00:26:49,115
No. They just hit me a little.

417
00:26:49,154 --> 00:26:50,246
Auto!

418
00:26:53,725 --> 00:26:56,353
Oh shit! We had to
get this rickshaw.

419
00:26:56,528 --> 00:26:57,859
She got me killed.
What do l do now?

420
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:00,462
Sit inside. He'll
come on his own.

421
00:27:01,266 --> 00:27:02,597
Why are you hiding your face?

422
00:27:02,701 --> 00:27:04,635
l recognise you from every side.

423
00:27:04,736 --> 00:27:06,636
Come on. Turn around.

424
00:27:06,772 --> 00:27:08,740

425
00:27:09,541 --> 00:27:11,839

00:27:14,146 --> 00:27:16,114
He is my dad..

427
00:27:17,149 --> 00:27:18,707
Uncle! Hello uncle.

428
00:27:19,451 --> 00:27:20,611
Bless you dear.

429
00:27:21,453 --> 00:27:24,081
Where do you want to
go? - Tell him.

430
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:26,587
l won't say anything.
You say it.

431
00:27:26,692 --> 00:27:28,557
Uncle leave me at Rohini
Metro Walk.

432
00:27:28,727 --> 00:27:31,093
Alright dear. Fine.

433
00:27:38,637 --> 00:27:40,400
We have reached Metro Walk.

434
00:27:43,842 --> 00:27:45,605
Uncle, how much was that?

435
00:27:46,178 --> 00:27:47,372
What is it? - Child.

436
00:27:47,446 --> 00:27:50,108
Do you think l'll take money
if you give me some?

437
00:27:50,515 --> 00:27:52,506
Sorry uncle. Thank
you uncle. Bye.

438
00:27:52,584 --> 00:27:54,381
Ok, child. - Bye dad.

439
00:27:54,486 --> 00:27:56,181
Don't 'bye dad' me! Come here.

440
00:27:56,254 --> 00:27:57,414
Where are you taking her?

441
00:27:57,489 --> 00:27:59,753
She wanted to buy shoes
from Liberty Showroom.

442
00:27:59,858 --> 00:28:02,520
You'll go around carrying
her shoes' bag for her?

443
00:28:02,627 --> 00:28:05,562
Dad, l was just.. - Go on.
She is waiting for you.

444
00:28:06,064 --> 00:28:07,156
Listen.

445
00:28:08,233 --> 00:28:09,598
Take 500 rupees.

446
00:28:10,068 --> 00:28:12,059
Don't be stingy in spending.

447
00:28:12,204 --> 00:28:14,138
You are going out with a
girl for the first time.

448
00:28:14,239 --> 00:28:17,072
Ok, dad. - Listen. Take
her to a movie.

449
00:28:17,342 --> 00:28:18,809
Yes. - Listen.

450
00:28:19,478 --> 00:28:21,275
While you watch a movie..

451
00:28:23,081 --> 00:28:24,309
What is this dad?

452
00:28:26,218 --> 00:28:30,484
The fool surely has something
to woo such a pretty girl.

453
00:28:31,223 --> 00:28:33,817
He is just like his father.

454
00:28:34,526 --> 00:28:36,585
Don't talk too much. Now..

455
00:28:37,796 --> 00:28:39,559
Keep studying. Keep studying.

456
00:28:40,132 --> 00:28:42,293
What happened? - Sushma.

457
00:28:42,467 --> 00:28:44,458
l have just seen a great scene.

458
00:28:44,536 --> 00:28:46,595
Did you watch a movie? -You
can assume it was one.

459
00:28:46,705 --> 00:28:49,503
Which one? -Grapes in
a monkey's beak.

460
00:28:50,175 --> 00:28:52,336
A monkey doesn't have
a beak. A crow does.

461
00:28:52,778 --> 00:28:54,143
Keep studying.

462
00:28:54,312 --> 00:28:56,337
Your son is a monkey though.

463
00:28:56,481 --> 00:28:58,540
Now ask me who the grape is.

464
00:28:59,251 --> 00:29:00,343
Who's the grape?

465
00:29:00,619 --> 00:29:05,249
There is a small sweet,
beautiful girl.

466
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:09,051
Kuku was taking her
around Metro Walk.

467
00:29:12,397 --> 00:29:15,662
When l asked him, he said that
he was helping her buy stuff.

468
00:29:15,801 --> 00:29:19,532
l asked him whether he was
acting as her porter.

469
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,165
What did you say the
name was? -Kuku.

470
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:28,074
The girl's name. - l didn't..

471
00:29:30,182 --> 00:29:31,410
Ok. You people study
chapter two.

472
00:29:31,483 --> 00:29:32,609
l'll be asking questions soon.

473
00:29:32,717 --> 00:29:34,480
l'll be back. Wait. -
Where are you going?

474
00:29:34,553 --> 00:29:36,817
Did you have to take shoes of
this brand from this mall?

475
00:29:37,189 --> 00:29:39,453
Duffer, this is the current
style. - Fine, ok.

476
00:29:39,658 --> 00:29:42,092
Whom are you calling? - My son.

477
00:29:42,194 --> 00:29:44,492
How will you find him
in such a big mall?

478
00:29:45,497 --> 00:29:48,591
Your eyes imply that you
got him a mobile phone.

479
00:29:49,101 --> 00:29:51,535
Whom did you ask before getting
him one? -l decided it myself.

480
00:29:51,636 --> 00:29:53,103
lt's alright then.

481
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,105
These are cool, right?
- Yes, cool.

482
00:29:58,376 --> 00:29:59,809
lt's mother's call.

483
00:30:00,412 --> 00:30:02,346
Hello. - Mummy. -Pack this.

484
00:30:02,414 --> 00:30:05,144
Where are you, son?
What are you doing?

485
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:07,675
Me? Nothing much, mother.

486
00:30:07,853 --> 00:30:10,481
That's good then. Come
home quickly.

487
00:30:10,689 --> 00:30:12,384
We'll eat and drink some stuff.

488
00:30:12,524 --> 00:30:16,119
Then we'll watch a movie in
Delight. A night show.

489
00:30:16,294 --> 00:30:18,159
Mummy, during the night l..

490
00:30:18,296 --> 00:30:20,787
You must be playing football.
- Yes mother.

491
00:30:21,633 --> 00:30:24,193
Mummy, no one plays football
during night-time.

492
00:30:24,302 --> 00:30:26,634
Why? These days don't
you have those..

493
00:30:26,872 --> 00:30:30,364
..day and night football
and cricket matches?

494
00:30:30,475 --> 00:30:32,670
Mummy, tell me clearly.
What is it?

495
00:30:32,744 --> 00:30:34,837
ln clear terms, take that girl
and come here right now.

496
00:30:34,913 --> 00:30:37,313
l want to meet her.
- Which girl?

497
00:30:37,682 --> 00:30:39,445
'Which girl?' Don't act around.

498
00:30:39,551 --> 00:30:41,485
Your father has told
me everything.

499
00:30:41,586 --> 00:30:42,712
Why do you have to mention me?

500
00:30:42,821 --> 00:30:44,186
Are you coming or do you
want me to come there?

501
00:30:44,289 --> 00:30:45,654
Yes aunt. We are coming.

502
00:30:47,425 --> 00:30:49,154
Ramesh. Shabbir. Come here!

503
00:30:49,227 --> 00:30:50,626
Look down there! -What happened?

504
00:30:50,695 --> 00:30:52,788
What are you doing? -Dad
is going to hit me and..

505
00:30:52,864 --> 00:30:54,559
..you'll have mother
beat me up too.

506
00:30:54,733 --> 00:30:57,497
l have already met your dad. Now
l have to meet your mother.

507
00:30:57,602 --> 00:30:58,694
l have to see your house too.

508
00:30:58,803 --> 00:31:01,601
There is nothing in my house.
lt's like a matchbox.

509
00:31:02,174 --> 00:31:04,142
My parents are absolute duffers.

510
00:31:04,709 --> 00:31:07,234
l like duffers a lot.
You know that, right?

511
00:31:12,317 --> 00:31:13,841
Hello uncle. - Child!

512
00:31:14,886 --> 00:31:16,114

513
00:31:21,793 --> 00:31:24,591
Sushma. - Yes? -They
have come. - Who?

514
00:31:24,696 --> 00:31:26,891
She saw me wearing shorts.
- Who came?

515
00:31:29,334 --> 00:31:31,768
ls this.. is that her?

516
00:31:32,304 --> 00:31:33,362
Maahi.

517
00:31:38,677 --> 00:31:42,169
She is very beautiful.
- l told you.

518
00:31:42,414 --> 00:31:45,577
She is 100 times better
than what you said.

519
00:31:45,817 --> 00:31:47,614
Come on, child. l have made
lentils and vegetables.

520
00:31:47,686 --> 00:31:49,210
l was just making the last roti.

521
00:31:49,321 --> 00:31:51,152
Mrs. Sushma, have
you gone crazy?

522
00:31:51,223 --> 00:31:52,781
Will you give her this
stuff to eat?

523
00:31:53,325 --> 00:31:55,316
Let's take her to a restaurant
or something.

524
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,552
Your zipper.

525
00:31:58,396 --> 00:32:00,591
You are just.. - lt's closed
now. Shall we leave?

526
00:32:00,865 --> 00:32:02,662
No uncle. l want to
eat food here.

527
00:32:02,801 --> 00:32:04,769
Lentils are of my
favourite kind.

528
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:08,198
lt's Bengal gram dear. Sit.

529
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,235
Yes. - Sit down.

530
00:32:11,343 --> 00:32:14,141
l'll take a seat. There.

531
00:32:15,113 --> 00:32:16,307
l have sat.

532
00:32:17,782 --> 00:32:20,546
What.. -People sit according
to their status, right?

533
00:32:20,852 --> 00:32:22,752
A boy and a girl.

534
00:32:24,456 --> 00:32:26,390
Porter, keep the goods
down and sit.

535
00:32:26,491 --> 00:32:28,356
Why are you making a
grumpy face? Sit.

536
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,894
Come, my son. -Here, dear.

537
00:32:31,363 --> 00:32:33,194
This is your plate and
this is for me.

538
00:32:33,298 --> 00:32:35,596
He has one. This one is for her.

539
00:32:36,134 --> 00:32:39,570
This is our house's napkin. Tell
me whenever you'd want it.

540
00:32:39,771 --> 00:32:40,897
Oh no!

541
00:32:41,906 --> 00:32:43,533
Cottage cheese and
peas, take it.

542
00:32:43,675 --> 00:32:45,267
lf l would know that
you are coming..

543
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:47,469
..l would have made nice
and special food.

544
00:32:47,846 --> 00:32:50,747
l got the appetisers too.

545
00:32:51,182 --> 00:32:52,410
You'll have to eat it all, ok?

546
00:32:52,484 --> 00:32:54,315
Aunt, l cannot eat all this.

547
00:32:54,452 --> 00:32:56,181
Fine, eat a bit of everything.

548
00:32:57,922 --> 00:33:00,254
Which year do you study
in? - 10th grade.

549
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:02,524
How old are you? - Mummy.

550
00:33:03,328 --> 00:33:04,818
Did l ask you anything?

551
00:33:05,363 --> 00:33:06,853
Shut up. - l'm 15.

552
00:33:07,532 --> 00:33:10,524
This idiot is almost 1 7. He's
still in the 1 1th grade.

553
00:33:11,102 --> 00:33:13,434
The day he passes out, l'll
distribute sweets in the area.

554
00:33:13,538 --> 00:33:16,473
My son has passed! -lgnore that.

555
00:33:16,574 --> 00:33:18,599
He has a habit of harassing him.

556
00:33:18,877 --> 00:33:22,677
Even he knows that his son
is one in a million.

557
00:33:23,748 --> 00:33:24,840
Here.

558
00:33:25,784 --> 00:33:27,251
Eat it, dear. Eat it while
it is hot. - Eat, dear.

559
00:33:27,352 --> 00:33:28,614
You should eat too, aunt.

560
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,780
l'll be satisfied
if you eat, dear.

561
00:33:36,394 --> 00:33:38,589
l took his photo during
childhood.

562
00:33:38,697 --> 00:33:40,824
He was standing naked.
- What is this, dad?

563
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,368
Take these sweets. l made them.

564
00:33:44,502 --> 00:33:46,470
No aunt. How can l accept this?

565
00:33:46,538 --> 00:33:48,267
Child, there are others
in your house.

566
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,501
They can all taste some of it.
Who else lives with you?

567
00:33:50,575 --> 00:33:51,701
My parents.

568
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:54,337
What does your father
do? - Mummy, what..

569
00:33:54,412 --> 00:33:55,811
Shut up. l'm not talking to you.

570
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:59,443
He's an advocate. - Advocate?

571
00:34:01,086 --> 00:34:03,520
Advocate implies
popular lawyers.

572
00:34:03,655 --> 00:34:06,385
Their photos appear in
newspapers and magazines.

573
00:34:06,491 --> 00:34:09,585
You mean someone like this.

574
00:34:10,128 --> 00:34:12,596
l saw this today. -
That is my father.

575
00:34:20,171 --> 00:34:21,729
This is your father? - Yes.

576
00:34:23,508 --> 00:34:25,499
He looks like a big
man in the photo.

577
00:34:27,512 --> 00:34:30,242
A phone call from
London. - Hello.

578
00:34:30,615 --> 00:34:31,843
Hello, mother. How are you?

579
00:34:32,117 --> 00:34:34,881
Hi child. How are you? -When

580
00:34:35,553 --> 00:34:38,215
Child, l did tell him but..

581
00:34:38,723 --> 00:34:40,691
Excuse me. -l knew that.

582
00:34:41,626 --> 00:34:42,786
Let me talk to her. - Maahi.

583
00:34:42,894 --> 00:34:44,828
Hello Maahi. How are you, child?

584
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:47,189
l'm alright, papa. - Anything
you want from London?

585
00:34:47,298 --> 00:34:49,232
No papa. - Ok then.

586
00:34:49,401 --> 00:34:50,834
Wish you a very happy new year.

587
00:34:51,136 --> 00:34:53,502
Thanks papa. Same to you.
-Ok? Bye Maahi. - Bye.

Wow!

590
00:35:17,362 --> 00:35:19,523
Will you really not go home
in the night? - No.

591
00:35:20,565 --> 00:35:22,089
What did you tell your parents?

592
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,225
Why do you care? - Tell me.

593
00:35:24,803 --> 00:35:27,363
My parents have gone to
London again. Duffer!

594
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,638
Happy new year! -
Happy new year!

595
00:35:35,346 --> 00:35:36,608
Hi. - Hi!

596
00:35:37,115 --> 00:35:39,106
Happy new year! -
Happy new year!

597
00:35:39,217 --> 00:35:41,742
Hi! Happy new year!
- Happy new year!

598
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,818
Hi! Happy new year! Why
are you going there?

599
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:46,780
Come here. We'll dance.

600
00:35:49,761 --> 00:35:52,855
lf our parents find out
they'll hit us a lot.

601
00:35:53,798 --> 00:35:55,663
Ok, don't come to save me.

602
00:35:56,634 --> 00:35:58,329
That is if l survive.

603
00:35:58,837 --> 00:36:01,169
My dad isn't going
to be soft on me.

604
00:36:01,306 --> 00:36:03,297
Your mother? - Mummy?

605
00:36:04,175 --> 00:36:05,574
My mother has been saving me.

606
00:36:05,677 --> 00:36:08,237
Otherwise l would have
been dead by now.

607
00:36:12,517 --> 00:36:14,610
That is not how you do it.

608
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,650
Wow! You know to do many tasks.

609
00:36:18,389 --> 00:36:20,152
l won't call you a duffer
all the time now.

610
00:36:20,291 --> 00:36:22,418
Thanks. - Happy new year!

611
00:36:22,527 --> 00:36:24,461
Happy new year! -

Happy new year!

613
00:36:44,148 --> 00:36:45,308
Champagne?

614
00:36:45,783 --> 00:36:48,411
l got it from dad's stock.
Have you ever had some?

615
00:36:48,486 --> 00:36:50,420
No but l have seen
it in many movies.

616
00:36:50,522 --> 00:36:52,251
Give it to me. l'll open it.

617
00:37:23,855 --> 00:37:25,447
Empty it. Bottoms up!

618
00:37:25,857 --> 00:37:28,451
Are you alright? -
Top of the world.

619
00:37:35,166 --> 00:37:36,326
Are you alright?

620
00:37:37,101 --> 00:37:38,728
Why am l feeling dizzy?

621
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:42,298
Go to sleep now. - Where
are you going?

622
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,700
Come here. Come.

623
00:37:54,185 --> 00:37:56,210
Have you ever slept with a girl?

624
00:38:00,558 --> 00:38:01,650
Kuku!

625
00:38:04,062 --> 00:38:05,120
No.

626
00:38:06,431 --> 00:38:08,729
Look at your face. lt's pinkish.

627
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,058
You look like an idiot.

628
00:38:17,208 --> 00:38:20,177
Ok, have you ever kissed a girl?

629
00:38:26,584 --> 00:38:28,518
Come on, kiss me.

630
00:38:31,255 --> 00:38:32,347
Maahi.

631
00:38:34,225 --> 00:38:36,216
l want to see how it feels.

632
00:38:38,796 --> 00:38:39,854
Do it.

633
00:39:11,195 --> 00:39:12,526
What happened?

634
00:39:13,364 --> 00:39:14,661
Didn't you like it?

635
00:39:16,134 --> 00:39:17,260
l don't know.

636
00:39:21,673 --> 00:39:23,504
Come on. Let's do
it again and see.

637
00:39:50,201 --> 00:39:51,463
Wait Maahi. Will this be right?

638
00:39:51,569 --> 00:39:53,799
Can't you be quiet for
a while? Duffer!

639
00:40:21,365 --> 00:40:22,764
Good morning.

640
00:40:27,171 --> 00:40:29,731
Now you won't meet
me, right? - Why?

641
00:40:31,275 --> 00:40:35,143
lf a boy spends a night with a
girl, he doesn't meet her again.

642
00:40:36,647 --> 00:40:38,877
Who told you that?
- My friends did.

643
00:40:39,617 --> 00:40:41,608
lt's rubbish. - Will you
keep meeting me then?

644
00:40:41,686 --> 00:40:43,153
Of course. - Why?

645
00:40:43,354 --> 00:40:45,720
What do you mean by 'why'?
-Do you love me?

646
00:40:47,291 --> 00:40:51,227
l don't know but l
do like you a lot.

647
00:40:51,329 --> 00:40:54,355
You're just reassuring me,right?
- No. l'm telling the truth.

648
00:40:54,665 --> 00:40:58,226
Alright then. Tell me when
you fall in love.

649
00:40:58,603 --> 00:41:00,696
Ok. - So are we friends?

650
00:41:01,372 --> 00:41:02,498
Friends.

651
00:41:12,283 --> 00:41:14,376
The environs have changed.

652
00:41:16,687 --> 00:41:18,678
There is fragrance in the air.

653
00:41:21,292 --> 00:41:27,788
My world is immersed
in colours.

654
00:41:28,299 --> 00:41:32,827
Your friendship is
so beautiful.

655
00:41:34,438 --> 00:41:40,138
l feel that life has
been renewed.

656
00:41:42,213 --> 00:41:46,707
Now whether it is happiness
or sorrow.

657
00:41:47,151 --> 00:41:49,142
l'll be there for you.

658
00:41:51,389 --> 00:41:55,723
Our friendship will
never be lessened.

659
00:41:56,327 --> 00:41:58,295
l'll be there for you.

660
00:42:30,494 --> 00:42:33,827
We are birds. We can
even sleep mid-air.

661
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:37,497
We will belong to the skies.

662
00:42:38,269 --> 00:42:41,602
You'll see. We will belong
to the skies.

663
00:42:41,772 --> 00:42:43,706
You'll see, friend.

664
00:42:44,375 --> 00:42:46,570
We will dance on clouds.

665
00:42:48,179 --> 00:42:50,147
We have to stumble
and recover.

666
00:42:50,248 --> 00:42:52,375
Now we have to walk together.

667
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:56,642
We have to colour the
world in our ways.

668
00:42:57,355 --> 00:42:59,380
We have to stumble
and recover.

669
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:01,720
Now we have to walk together.

670
00:43:02,226 --> 00:43:05,718
We have to colour the
world in our ways.

671
00:43:07,398 --> 00:43:11,596
Now whether it is happiness
or sorrow.

672
00:43:12,303 --> 00:43:14,134
l'll be there for you.

673
00:43:16,374 --> 00:43:21,243
Our friendship will
never be lessened.

674
00:43:21,512 --> 00:43:23,377
l'll be there for you.

675
00:43:30,521 --> 00:43:35,117
Now whether it is happiness
or sorrow.

676
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:37,293
l'll be there for you.

677
00:43:38,896 --> 00:43:40,830
No, definitely not Mr. Bhalla.

678
00:43:41,165 --> 00:43:44,225
Our case is very strong.
l am there. - Sir.

679
00:43:44,735 --> 00:43:46,669
Come later. - Ok, sir. -Next

680
00:43:46,771 --> 00:43:49,171
When l return l'll fix
your meeting, alright?

681
00:43:49,307 --> 00:43:51,275
No. lt'll be done. The judge
is an acquaintance.

682
00:43:51,409 --> 00:43:53,240
Alright. Ok, bye.

683
00:43:54,245 --> 00:43:56,509
Yes Robin? Do you have
something to discuss?

684
00:43:56,614 --> 00:43:58,206
Yes. Madam has said that
while returning..

685
00:43:58,316 --> 00:43:59,715

up after sports.

686

Ok, l'll do that. Anything

Should l send him in? - Don't

690
00:44:08,192 --> 00:44:10,524
Tell him that papers will come
from the court next week.

691
00:44:10,594 --> 00:44:12,357
We'll talk after that.
Ok? Alright.

692
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:14,261
Send Mukesh in, ok? - Yes sir.

693
00:44:14,398 --> 00:44:16,195
Sir, year 2000's journal. - Yes.

694
00:44:16,801 --> 00:44:18,234
Tell me Robin. What
were you saying?

695
00:44:18,369 --> 00:44:20,132
Sir, l was talking about baby.

696
00:44:20,304 --> 00:44:22,272
She doesn't take her
car these days.

697
00:44:22,373 --> 00:44:24,273
l stay around and she
leaves without it.

698
00:44:24,842 --> 00:44:26,776
You called me, sir?
- Yes Mukesh.

699
00:44:27,111 --> 00:44:28,806
l may have to go to UK. - Yes.

700
00:44:29,113 --> 00:44:31,308
You'll have to file affidavit
for the Ahuwalia case in court.

701
00:44:31,382 --> 00:44:33,373
Ok? - Yes sir. -Take a new
date then. - Right sir.

702
00:44:33,451 --> 00:44:35,681
Anything else? - No. That's
it. -Ok sir. Right.

703
00:44:36,354 --> 00:44:37,844
Tell me Robin. What
were you saying?

704
00:44:38,122 --> 00:44:40,556
Sir, l thought of informing you.

705
00:44:40,858 --> 00:44:42,587
Baby is very nice.

706
00:44:43,194 --> 00:44:46,493
Still, a lonely girl gets
unnerved when alone in house.

707
00:44:47,164 --> 00:44:49,655
You must have some
time for her too.

708
00:44:57,241 --> 00:44:59,471
Robin. Sorry.

709
00:45:00,244 --> 00:45:02,735
l wasn't listening. Tell me.

710
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:06,149
This is the 3rd year wherein
you've missed her birthday.

711
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:07,808
Sir, this isn't right.

712
00:45:09,553 --> 00:45:10,645
Ok.

713
00:45:20,698 --> 00:45:21,790
Robin, wait.

714
00:45:25,236 --> 00:45:26,601
Let's do something, Robin.

715
00:45:26,804 --> 00:45:29,329
First we'll go to Connaught
place and buy a gift for Maahi.

716
00:45:29,507 --> 00:45:32,237
Ok? After that we'll
go and get madam.

717
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:34,610
Ok? - Thank you sir.

718
00:45:35,112 --> 00:45:36,170
Come on.

719
00:45:37,314 --> 00:45:38,645
Good evening, sir. -
Good evening Suzy.

720
00:45:38,716 --> 00:45:39,808
Good evening, madam.
- Good evening.

721
00:45:39,884 --> 00:45:41,784
Maahi is home, right? - Yes.

722
00:46:01,772 --> 00:46:03,330
Hi. - Hello.

723
00:46:03,474 --> 00:46:05,465
Hi. - Sit, sit.

724
00:46:07,511 --> 00:46:09,809
May we sit with you? - Yes papa.

725
00:46:10,281 --> 00:46:12,272
Please sit uncle. - Thank you.

726
00:46:14,418 --> 00:46:16,283
So there's a party?

727
00:46:17,221 --> 00:46:18,813
You are even drinking beer.

728
00:46:22,793 --> 00:46:25,261
Won't you introduce us to
your friends, Maahi?

729
00:46:25,496 --> 00:46:27,225
Shabbir. - Hi.

730
00:46:27,832 --> 00:46:29,299
Mushtaq, sir. - Hi Mushtaq.

731
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,425
l'm Ramesh. - And this?

732
00:46:31,569 --> 00:46:34,732
Kabir. - He's called
Kabir formally, sir.

733
00:46:35,139 --> 00:46:36,629
His friends call him Kuku.

734
00:46:41,312 --> 00:46:43,280
Where did you meet
these boys, Maahi?

735
00:46:44,281 --> 00:46:46,112
Papa, they are my friends.

736
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:48,115
lt's obvious. They have
come to your house.

737
00:46:48,185 --> 00:46:51,279
They have to be your friends. l
asked you where you met them.

738
00:46:51,555 --> 00:46:52,886
ln a school function.

739
00:46:53,357 --> 00:46:56,292
You must have met them during
a Christmas function.

740
00:46:56,494 --> 00:46:58,792
St. Mount Abu's boys come there.

741
00:46:58,896 --> 00:47:01,057
Even Dev's son goes there. - Ok.

742
00:47:01,198 --> 00:47:03,666
You all are from St. Mount
Abu's. -No, we are..

743
00:47:03,834 --> 00:47:05,768
No sir. We are from
Lala Dindayal..

744
00:47:05,836 --> 00:47:07,531
..charitable higher secondary
school. Beriwalan.

745
00:47:07,605 --> 00:47:09,470
l see. - lt is government
recognised.

746
00:47:10,774 --> 00:47:13,265
lt's a charitable trust. They
probably don't have fees.

747
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:15,742
No. We do have to pay.

748
00:47:16,113 --> 00:47:17,705
lt's just a little
less. - l see.

749
00:47:17,848 --> 00:47:20,339
Kuku hasn't been paying it
since six months, sir.

750
00:47:22,553 --> 00:47:24,418
You stay in the same locality?

751
00:47:25,089 --> 00:47:27,080
Beriwalan, near the
vegetable market.

752
00:47:27,691 --> 00:47:31,092
Ok. Recently there was a malaria
outbreak there, right?

753
00:47:31,395 --> 00:47:33,829
No sir. There was a dengue
outbreak in our area.

754
00:47:34,265 --> 00:47:37,166
Malaria was very far away. - Ok.

755
00:47:38,435 --> 00:47:39,834
What do your parents do?

756
00:47:40,337 --> 00:47:42,134
My dad has an auto-rickshaw.

757
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:44,630
Wholesale or manufacturing
or what?

758
00:47:44,742 --> 00:47:46,369
No, he drives one.

759
00:47:47,478 --> 00:47:49,173
My father has a laundry, sir.

760
00:47:50,114 --> 00:47:52,514
My dad has a garage at GT
road. -My dad is at DTC..

761
00:47:52,583 --> 00:47:55,552
Well that's a really interesting
bunch of people. Nice friends.

762
00:47:55,886 --> 00:47:57,717
Nice meeting you
all. Good night.

763
00:47:58,122 --> 00:47:59,453
Uncle, will you have some
kebabs? No thanks.

764
00:47:59,557 --> 00:48:00,785
Thank you good night.

765
00:48:01,058 --> 00:48:02,787
Your papa got you this
birthday present.

766
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:04,584
He was feeling sorry, ok?

767
00:48:07,131 --> 00:48:09,190
Don't delay it too much. Ok?

768
00:48:09,733 --> 00:48:12,258
Ok, aunt. Good night. -Good
night aunt. Bye. - Good night.

769
00:48:19,243 --> 00:48:20,767
lt's really very late.

770
00:48:23,781 --> 00:48:25,612
Come on Kuku. Let's go, hurry.

771
00:48:33,524 --> 00:48:34,616
Come in.

772
00:48:38,596 --> 00:48:40,461
Maahi, you haven't
gone to sleep yet?

773
00:48:41,398 --> 00:48:43,389
May l come in? l want
to talk to you.

774
00:48:52,343 --> 00:48:55,141
Shouldn't you look at them
while talking to someone?

775
00:48:58,349 --> 00:49:00,283
You haven't even changed
clothes yet.

776
00:49:05,055 --> 00:49:08,752
Look, Maahi. Don't misunderstand
my words.

777
00:49:10,694 --> 00:49:14,221
l haven't come to complain
or bad-mouth your friends.

778
00:49:15,766 --> 00:49:17,563
All l have come to say is that..

779
00:49:17,668 --> 00:49:20,296
..we hang out with people
who are equals.

780
00:49:21,205 --> 00:49:23,537
Boys that study in a
government school..

781
00:49:24,308 --> 00:49:26,833
..normally don't have a good
class or background.

782
00:49:28,512 --> 00:49:31,504
Then again, if your culture,
thinking and living habits..

783
00:49:31,615 --> 00:49:35,107
..don't match with someone,
what's the use of being friends?

784
00:49:36,453 --> 00:49:38,546
l didn't make friends
for using them.

785
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:41,854
Ok. l believe that.

786
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:44,327
lt is possible though that
those boys may have..

787
00:49:44,395 --> 00:49:46,329
..become your friends
to exploit you.

788
00:49:48,399 --> 00:49:49,491
No.

789
00:49:50,701 --> 00:49:52,259
Look child.. - Please.

790
00:49:54,104 --> 00:49:55,833
You always call me as Maahi.

791
00:49:56,473 --> 00:49:59,101
When you call me child,
you'll be bitter.

792
00:50:01,879 --> 00:50:04,347
Even if l talk bitterly it
will be for your good.

793
00:50:04,515 --> 00:50:06,107
Not to cause you a loss.

794
00:50:10,154 --> 00:50:11,849
The boy who was sitting with
you. What was his name?

795
00:50:12,122 --> 00:50:13,350
Kuku. - Kuku!

796
00:50:13,624 --> 00:50:17,526
Don't ask me to not be friends
with him. l won't accept it.

797
00:50:18,529 --> 00:50:20,326
You'll regret it if you don't.

798
00:50:20,397 --> 00:50:22,422
l won't regret it. - You will!

799
00:50:24,268 --> 00:50:25,599
l won't regret it!

800
00:50:32,142 --> 00:50:33,734
What did you talk
to Maahi about?

801
00:50:35,479 --> 00:50:37,413
Can someone talk sensibly
with her?

802
00:50:37,614 --> 00:50:39,275
She keeps back-answering.

803
00:50:39,883 --> 00:50:42,215
Your daughter is so spoilt and
you don't even know it.

804
00:50:42,353 --> 00:50:44,753
Why are you blaming me?
What have l done?

805
00:50:44,888 --> 00:50:47,356
What have you done? lf you would
spend some more time with her..

806
00:50:47,424 --> 00:50:49,153
..this wouldn't have happened.

807
00:50:49,593 --> 00:50:52,153
You scold her once
in 7-10 days..

808
00:50:52,262 --> 00:50:54,162
..and you think you are
taking care of her?

809
00:50:54,264 --> 00:50:55,595
ls it only a mother's
responsibility?

810
00:50:55,666 --> 00:50:57,759
Doesn't a father have it as a
duty? -l'm not saying that Pakhi.

811
00:50:57,868 --> 00:51:01,201
Have l spoilt her? You didn't
give me any time to spoil her.

812
00:51:01,338 --> 00:51:03,670
Ok. -l even stopped working
when Maahi was born.

813
00:51:03,774 --> 00:51:05,105
What happened then? - What?

814
00:51:05,175 --> 00:51:07,336
You immersed me in your
business engagements.

815
00:51:07,444 --> 00:51:09,207
Please get out. - Attending
your boring parties..

816
00:51:09,313 --> 00:51:12,111
..entertaining your friends..
- You wanted to work, Pakhi.

817
00:51:12,182 --> 00:51:14,650
This! lt became more
important for you.

818
00:51:15,185 --> 00:51:16,880
l didn't get time for Maahi.

819
00:51:18,155 --> 00:51:19,452
Do something. Leave all
this from today.

820
00:51:19,556 --> 00:51:21,524
Leave all that. Stay at home.
Spend time with Maahi.

821
00:51:21,625 --> 00:51:23,183
Alright. Alright!

822
00:51:23,293 --> 00:51:25,853
l'd be too happy to do that.
l'll do that from now on.

823
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:29,256
Will you kindly tell me
what she has done..

824
00:51:29,366 --> 00:51:31,459
..for you to get so angry?
-Don't you know?

825
00:51:31,602 --> 00:51:33,729
Didn't you see it? Didn't
you see her behaviour?

826
00:51:33,804 --> 00:51:37,467
Which behaviour? -The kids were
partying and having fun.

827
00:51:37,608 --> 00:51:40,543
Was it a sin?-Pakhi,
l am not calling it a sin.

828
00:51:40,811 --> 00:51:43,439
Why was she calling street
boys home though?

829
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,910
Can't she make some nice
friends of her class?

830
00:51:46,817 --> 00:51:48,876
Did you see that boy? The boy
who was sitting next to her.

831
00:51:49,153 --> 00:51:50,780
Kuku! - What's wrong with him?

832
00:51:50,854 --> 00:51:52,481
He was nice and cute boy.

833
00:51:52,589 --> 00:51:55,456
Are you deliberately trying to
not understand what l am saying?

834
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:57,693
Maahi has made him
her boyfriend.

835
00:51:57,795 --> 00:52:00,161
They were sharing their meals.

836
00:52:00,264 --> 00:52:03,199
God! Will that cause your
daughter to be pregnant?

837
00:52:28,425 --> 00:52:29,756
Extevose 20.

838
00:52:31,462 --> 00:52:32,724
Whose Packguard is this? - Mine.

839
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:34,422
50 rupees madam.

840
00:52:35,165 --> 00:52:36,894
Madam, your Ose 20. 70 rupees.

841
00:52:37,167 --> 00:52:39,397
Whom are you taking that for?
-lt's for me. Do you want some?

842
00:52:39,503 --> 00:52:41,198
Give me a strip of Combiflam.

843
00:53:01,492 --> 00:53:03,289
Give me two minutes Maahi.
The match will be over.

844
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:05,485
Go on. What are you
doing? -Kuku..

845
00:53:06,830 --> 00:53:08,695
Kuku, l'm pregnant.

846
00:53:11,502 --> 00:53:13,367
You are a complete nut!

847
00:53:13,504 --> 00:53:15,563
You idiot, while romancing
her didn't you realise..

848
00:53:15,639 --> 00:53:17,300
..that this can cause something
else as well?

849
00:53:17,407 --> 00:53:18,738
Now it's already done.

850
00:53:19,710 --> 00:53:22,304
Will you just keep blaming
me or tell me a way out?

851
00:53:22,646 --> 00:53:25,308
There is only one way out now.
Just have an abortion.

852
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:33,651
What are you saying?

853
00:53:34,458 --> 00:53:36,619
What else will you do?
Think about it.

854
00:53:43,233 --> 00:53:44,666
'Maahi has made him
her boyfriend.'

855
00:53:44,835 --> 00:53:46,496
'Don't you know? Didn't
you see it?'

856
00:53:46,570 --> 00:53:47,764
'Didn't you see her behaviour?'

857
00:53:47,838 --> 00:53:50,272
'Will that cause your daughter
to be pregnant?'

858
00:53:50,374 --> 00:53:53,468
'l'm pregnant. - Just
have an abortion.'

859
00:54:23,807 --> 00:54:25,707

Take me with you, my beloved.

866
00:55:11,288 --> 00:55:15,725
Take me with you, my beloved.

867
00:55:16,226 --> 00:55:20,856
Without you, l don't
like anything.

868
00:55:21,198 --> 00:55:24,099
l don't know anything now.

869
00:55:24,267 --> 00:55:26,098
Take me away..

870
00:55:26,169 --> 00:55:30,799
Without you, l don't

871
00:55:31,108 --> 00:55:33,736
l don't know anything now.

872
00:55:35,812 --> 00:55:40,272
You are my passion. You
are my calming force.

873
00:55:40,384 --> 00:55:43,876
God knows this.

874
00:55:45,689 --> 00:55:50,126
Take me with you, my beloved.

875
00:55:50,694 --> 00:55:54,858
Take me with you, my beloved.

876
00:56:00,170 --> 00:56:04,698
Even for a moment they
don't let us live..

877
00:56:05,142 --> 00:56:09,238
..loneliness which comes
through memories.

878
00:56:10,147 --> 00:56:14,277
They are followed
from behind..

879
00:56:15,085 --> 00:56:18,486
..by shadows of dreams.

880
00:56:19,222 --> 00:56:23,591
l have trusted you.
Don't betray me.

881
00:56:24,828 --> 00:56:28,787
Don't destroy my hope.

882
00:56:30,333 --> 00:56:34,565
You are my passion. You
are my calming force.

883
00:56:34,738 --> 00:56:38,834
God knows this.

884
00:56:40,210 --> 00:56:44,203
Take me with you, my beloved.

885
00:56:45,148 --> 00:56:48,811
Take me with you..

886
00:57:01,565 --> 00:57:03,328
What happened to my son?

ls there a problem?

888
00:57:06,203 --> 00:57:07,329
Do you want money?

889
00:57:09,639 --> 00:57:11,072
What is it then?

890
00:57:12,109 --> 00:57:15,078
Will you say something or
just stand there quiet?

891
00:57:15,545 --> 00:57:17,775
l will have to tell you.
- Tell me then.

892
00:57:18,148 --> 00:57:19,672
Should l? - Tell me.

893
00:57:20,317 --> 00:57:21,579

Will you say it now or should l
hit you? -Maahi is pregnant.

895
00:57:27,657 --> 00:57:30,319
Mummy! Mummy! Oh God!

896
00:57:31,561 --> 00:57:34,428
Mummy! Mummy!

897
00:57:34,531 --> 00:57:37,557
Bewildered people,

898
00:57:37,701 --> 00:57:40,602
From where l have come
and who l am.

899
00:57:40,771 --> 00:57:43,569
Who am l? Who am l?

900
00:57:43,707 --> 00:57:46,403
l'm the don!

901
00:57:48,845 --> 00:57:53,111
Do you know? Do you know
what this is, Sushma?

902
00:57:53,216 --> 00:57:57,380
What is it? - l've got the
third prize in a lottery.

903
00:57:57,487 --> 00:58:01,651
l have won 25000 rupees.
How much? - 25000!

904
00:58:02,225 --> 00:58:04,193
This time l will certainly
take you to Massuri.

905
00:58:04,294 --> 00:58:05,784
We will both have fun.

906
00:58:07,063 --> 00:58:09,395
Sit, l'll get some buttermilk.
-Buttermilk?

907
00:58:09,566 --> 00:58:13,366
You give me buttermilk
when l am angry.

908
00:58:13,703 --> 00:58:15,261
lt could happen now.

909
00:58:15,639 --> 00:58:17,766
l mean, l have already
prepared it.

910
00:58:18,074 --> 00:58:20,634
l'll get it. Excuse me.

911
00:58:21,645 --> 00:58:25,172
What is going on? The mother
is buttering me.

912
00:58:25,682 --> 00:58:27,479
The son is studying.

913
00:58:29,085 --> 00:58:32,248
Tell me clearly what
is going on?

914
00:58:32,389 --> 00:58:35,085
l'll tell you everything
clearly. Everything.

915
00:58:35,158 --> 00:58:36,648
Have this buttermilk first.

916
00:58:37,727 --> 00:58:41,185
l feel like singing. l'll have
the buttermilk later.

917
00:58:43,233 --> 00:58:47,329
What will happen tonight?

918
00:58:48,305 --> 00:58:49,397
Tell him.

919
00:58:55,178 --> 00:58:58,306
l'll tell you what
the matter is.

920
00:58:58,782 --> 00:59:02,809
You already know that Kuku
and Maahi meet each other.

921
00:59:03,787 --> 00:59:06,051
They are young and
with young blood.

922
00:59:06,556 --> 00:59:08,456
They may make mistakes.

923
00:59:08,792 --> 00:59:10,623
l'm wasting a lot of time.

924
00:59:11,194 --> 00:59:15,130
The thing is that Maahi
and Kuku.. she..

925
00:59:15,832 --> 00:59:18,767
Maahi is pregnant with Kuku's
child! l said it.

926
00:59:25,075 --> 00:59:28,203
No! Don't! - Get aside. -No!
- l said, move aside.

927
00:59:28,378 --> 00:59:31,404
Mummy! - l asked you to move.

928
00:59:31,514 --> 00:59:33,505
Listen to me. - l said move!

929
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,613
Why isn't this thing opening?

930
00:59:41,124 --> 00:59:43,649
Where is it? Where? - What
are you searching for?

931
00:59:44,127 --> 00:59:46,254
What is that? That sweet thing..

932
00:59:46,396 --> 00:59:48,421
A knife. - l have already
hidden it.

933
00:59:48,531 --> 00:59:50,294
What? Ok, fine.

934
00:59:50,433 --> 00:59:52,663
Yes. l'll break his head with
this. - No! Leave that.

935
00:59:52,769 --> 00:59:55,533
l'll break his head.
-Kuku, run! Run!

936
00:59:55,639 --> 00:59:57,834
Wait! - Daddy! -A fortune
teller said..

937
00:59:58,108 --> 01:00:00,338
..that you may die
when you are 1 7.

938
01:00:00,443 --> 01:00:03,435
Wait! Where will you go if
you run from the house?

939
01:00:03,546 --> 01:00:05,411
Move! - Move green grocer!

940
01:00:05,782 --> 01:00:06,840
Wait! Wait!

941
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:09,650
You're making fun of me in
the neighbourhood. -Kuku!

942
01:00:10,186 --> 01:00:11,551
Wait! -Hey!

943
01:00:13,823 --> 01:00:15,120
Hey! -Move!

944
01:00:15,759 --> 01:00:17,226
Kuku, run for your life.

945
01:00:17,327 --> 01:00:20,262
Stop! l said stop!

946
01:00:20,530 --> 01:00:24,557
Stop! Stop you idiot!

947
01:00:24,701 --> 01:00:27,295
Will you kill me by
making me run?

948
01:00:29,873 --> 01:00:31,898
Thug! Ruffian!

949
01:00:32,309 --> 01:00:35,472
You ruined that young girl's
life for your gain!

950
01:00:35,745 --> 01:00:38,270
You didn't even think that
she is someone's daughter.

951
01:00:38,348 --> 01:00:39,781
What would happen to her future!

952
01:00:39,883 --> 01:00:42,579
What have you done!
How did you do it?!

953
01:00:42,752 --> 01:00:44,777
What do you mean by 'how'?

954
01:00:44,921 --> 01:00:47,788
Shut up! Don't interfere
in everything.

955
01:00:48,191 --> 01:00:51,217
You don't know what he
has done to his life.

956
01:00:51,328 --> 01:00:52,920
We had so many expectations
from him.

957
01:00:53,229 --> 01:00:55,163
The worthless boy has
ruined them all.

958
01:00:55,265 --> 01:00:58,257
Look what a tramp and unfaithful
child you have borne.

959
01:00:58,401 --> 01:00:59,925
That's enough, dad.
lt's too much.

960
01:01:00,270 --> 01:01:02,101
Scold me, hit me and kill me.

961
01:01:02,205 --> 01:01:03,672
Don't say something
that is wrong.

962
01:01:03,773 --> 01:01:05,638
l am not a tramp and unfaithful.

963
01:01:06,109 --> 01:01:07,337
Whatever happened, it
was an accident.

964
01:01:07,444 --> 01:01:09,105
We haven't done it purposely.

965
01:01:09,212 --> 01:01:12,409
Look! He made a mistake and
is giving an excuse for it.

966
01:01:12,549 --> 01:01:15,347
Yes, l have made a mistake and
will handle its responsibility.

967
01:01:15,485 --> 01:01:17,578
How? - l have talked to Maahi.

968
01:01:17,687 --> 01:01:19,621
We went to get an abortion
done but..

969
01:01:22,892 --> 01:01:27,386
Do you know that abortion
is illegal?

970
01:01:28,365 --> 01:01:30,230
Now l won't spare you. - Daddy..

971
01:01:30,333 --> 01:01:32,494
Even if l may be hanged.
-Your blood-pressure.

972
01:01:36,172 --> 01:01:37,730
What happened? What happened?

973
01:01:39,409 --> 01:01:43,345
Mummy! -Sit here. Keep
your foot up. - Mummy.

974
01:01:44,414 --> 01:01:46,905
Mummy, are you alright? -You
have come, have you?!

975
01:01:47,350 --> 01:01:48,578
Now l'll kill you! - Mummy!

976
01:01:48,651 --> 01:01:50,243
Don't hit him.

977
01:01:50,353 --> 01:01:52,446
Mummy, l told you not to
reveal this to dad.

978
01:01:52,555 --> 01:01:54,147
He wouldn't understand.
He's stubborn.

979
01:01:54,257 --> 01:01:56,248
Why are you talking to her?
Look at me and talk.

980
01:01:56,359 --> 01:01:57,883
l'm looking straight
at you and speaking.

981
01:01:58,194 --> 01:01:59,491
l'll correct everything
that happened.

982
01:01:59,596 --> 01:02:01,655
l won't trouble you. -
You won't trouble me?

983
01:02:01,831 --> 01:02:05,358
Alright. Let's see how much
trouble you've caused till now.

984
01:02:05,802 --> 01:02:08,270
This is how you repay
our sacrifices?

985
01:02:08,538 --> 01:02:11,200
l have been driving a scooter
day and night to nurture you.

986
01:02:11,274 --> 01:02:13,868
l was hungry but l fed
you. - So? So what?

987
01:02:14,110 --> 01:02:15,702
All parents do that
for their children.

988
01:02:15,779 --> 01:02:17,872
They don't do it as a
duty but out of love.

989
01:02:18,148 --> 01:02:20,207
Your parents must have
done it for you too.

990
01:02:20,316 --> 01:02:21,806
l'll do it for my kids too.

991
01:02:22,218 --> 01:02:23,810
You haven't done
a favour for me.

992
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:25,314
lnsolent boy!

993
01:02:26,156 --> 01:02:28,784
l'll push you before a bus.
That'll finish it!

994
01:02:29,659 --> 01:02:31,786
l told you not to keep your foot
down! -Mummy, it's bleeding!

995
01:02:31,895 --> 01:02:34,261
You won't listen.. -Mummy,
let's go to a doctor..

996
01:02:34,597 --> 01:02:36,531
Don't dare to touch me!

997
01:02:36,699 --> 01:02:38,792
Pick her. Raise her up!

998
01:02:38,868 --> 01:02:40,665
Come to a doctor. - Take
her to a clinic.

999
01:02:40,737 --> 01:02:42,136
Mummy, please.

1000
01:02:42,305 --> 01:02:44,296
l'm sorry mother. -Hurry
up. Shravan Kumar!

1001
01:02:44,407 --> 01:02:45,601
Come on. Hurry!

1002
01:02:46,376 --> 01:02:47,843
Ashok Bajaj. Kuldeep Singh.

1003
01:02:48,144 --> 01:02:49,372
Mohit Puri, advocate.

1004
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:51,679
There are so many advocates.

1005
01:02:51,781 --> 01:02:53,806
Fights and arguments
aren't any lesser.

1006
01:02:54,484 --> 01:02:55,678
How do we find him?

1007
01:02:57,187 --> 01:02:58,245
Listen.

1008
01:02:59,189 --> 01:03:00,349
That is Mohit Puri.

1009
01:03:00,423 --> 01:03:02,653
Which one? - The one
wearing a grey coat.

1010
01:03:03,159 --> 01:03:05,821

l'll have your appointment
fixed. This is my card.

1017
01:03:20,577 --> 01:03:22,545
You won't understand
it, brother.

1018
01:03:22,645 --> 01:03:24,510
We are going to talk about
something personal.

1019
01:03:24,881 --> 01:03:27,748
lt's a personal issue. -l'm
sorry, l didn't recognise you.

1020

We haven't met before. How
could you recognise me?

1021
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:33,214
My son Kuku knows your
daughter well.

1022
01:03:33,289 --> 01:03:34,847
They are good friends.

1023
01:03:35,225 --> 01:03:38,888
Come to the point please.
- The point is that..

1024
01:03:42,132 --> 01:03:43,394
Come here. Come here!

1025

Papa! Sorry papa!
- 'Sorry papa'!

1026
01:03:45,869 --> 01:03:47,496
Don't hit her. - What have
you gone and done?!

1027
01:03:47,570 --> 01:03:50,164
Don't hit.. ask her first
whether it is true or false.

1028
01:03:50,273 --> 01:03:51,740
lt is true, mother.
l'm pregnant.

1029
01:03:51,875 --> 01:03:54,571
Did you hear that? Heard
it? Did you hear it?!

1030
01:03:54,811 --> 01:03:57,336
l thought l could get her good
education. She has ruined it all.

1031
01:03:57,580 --> 01:04:00,708
l'm going to kill her. Come over
here! -Maahi! - Stupid girl!

1032
01:04:01,084 --> 01:04:03,109
Stop it -Sorry papa!

1033
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:07,121
What's done is done. Now
try to correct it.

1034
01:04:07,257 --> 01:04:09,350
Being a brute won't help. -l
didn't ask you for an opinion.

1035
01:04:09,459 --> 01:04:10,585
She's going to America.

1036
01:04:10,693 --> 01:04:12,718
She'll get an abortion there
and study further.

1037
01:04:12,829 --> 01:04:14,694
l won't get an abortion. - What?

1038
01:04:16,566 --> 01:04:17,794
What did you say?

1039
01:04:19,335 --> 01:04:21,200
What did you say
to me? - Enough!

1040
01:04:21,304 --> 01:04:22,771
Enough is enough! Now stop it!

1041
01:04:22,839 --> 01:04:26,138
Pack her bags, ok? You
get ready to go, ok?

1042
01:04:28,878 --> 01:04:31,540
Papa, don't touch my phone.

1043
01:04:32,582 --> 01:04:36,382
No more calls. No phones,
no computer, no internet!

1044
01:04:36,486 --> 01:04:38,351
Stop all modes of communication!

1045
01:04:43,126 --> 01:04:45,117
What is it? Did you call her?

1046
01:04:45,328 --> 01:04:47,262
lt says the number
is out of service.

1047
01:04:47,530 --> 01:04:49,327
l think Maahi has a difficulty.

1048
01:04:49,499 --> 01:04:52,127
l'm going to her house. - Go on.

1049
01:04:52,235 --> 01:04:55,227
At the most the watchmen
will bash you up.

1050
01:04:55,338 --> 01:04:56,669
Shut up! Wait.

1051
01:04:56,806 --> 01:04:58,433
Don't listen to his blabber.

1052
01:04:58,575 --> 01:05:00,475
Go and find out what
the deal is.

1053
01:05:00,843 --> 01:05:03,141
Listen, take my bike's key.

1054
01:05:03,479 --> 01:05:05,743
Go carefully.

1055
01:05:05,815 --> 01:05:08,283
My beloved!

1056
01:05:11,187 --> 01:05:13,314
My beloved!

1057
01:05:18,294 --> 01:05:19,488
Kuku..

1058
01:05:20,597 --> 01:05:22,428
My phone calls have been barred.

1059
01:05:24,133 --> 01:05:26,101
Wait, l'm coming.

1060
01:05:38,414 --> 01:05:39,506
Maahi?

1061
01:05:41,217 --> 01:05:42,684
Maahi!

1062
01:05:43,152 --> 01:05:45,643
Maahi! Watchman! Stop
her watchman!

1063
01:05:45,788 --> 01:05:47,779
Stop her! - lf you
stop me, mother..

1064
01:05:48,124 --> 01:05:49,591
..or ask me to get
an abortion done..

1065
01:05:49,726 --> 01:05:51,523
..l'll hate you for all my life.

1066
01:05:51,594 --> 01:05:53,425
l'll hate you till
my last breath.

1067
01:05:58,167 --> 01:05:59,657
Come on, Kuku. Please hurry.

1068
01:06:08,544 --> 01:06:11,342
Come on. Hurry! -My beloved!

1069
01:06:14,083 --> 01:06:16,551
My beloved!

1070
01:06:19,355 --> 01:06:21,152
My beloved!

1071
01:06:32,702 --> 01:06:35,193
My beloved!

1072
01:06:37,874 --> 01:06:40,502
My beloved!

1073
01:06:44,814 --> 01:06:48,716
Always be with me, my darling.

1074
01:06:49,986 --> 01:06:52,978
Don't leave me mid-way.

1075
01:06:55,358 --> 01:07:02,924
After being in love with me,
don't break my heart.

1076
01:07:05,768 --> 01:07:13,800
My heart says that only you
are present in my heart.

1077
01:07:16,345 --> 01:07:24,275
My heart says that only you
are present in my heart.

1078
01:07:24,954 --> 01:07:27,718
My beloved!

1079
01:07:30,293 --> 01:07:33,490
My beloved!

1080
01:07:35,665 --> 01:07:38,600
My beloved!

1081
01:07:40,703 --> 01:07:43,263
My beloved!

1082
01:07:47,743 --> 01:07:51,770
Always be with me, my darling.
-Wow! Beautiful!

1083
01:07:52,281 --> 01:07:55,273
This is Taj lntercontinental
honeymoon cottage.

1084
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:58,548
Who owns this house?

1085
01:07:58,688 --> 01:08:00,485
For now, assume it
to be your own.

1086
01:08:00,656 --> 01:08:03,420
Actually, after my uncle died..

1087
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:05,953
..a legal battle ensued
among his six sons.

1088
01:08:06,429 --> 01:08:10,832
The house was stuck in
a legal hassle too.

1089
01:08:11,767 --> 01:08:13,632
No one has come here in
the last five years.

1090
01:08:13,870 --> 01:08:15,963
Nor will anyone come in
the next 15 years.

1091
01:08:16,873 --> 01:08:19,273
Love-birds, you can live
comfortably here.

1092
01:08:20,376 --> 01:08:22,571
Oh yes! The market-place
isn't nearby.

1093
01:08:22,912 --> 01:08:24,607
There are no people nearby.

1094
01:08:25,882 --> 01:08:29,215
Maahi, should we leave this
place and search somewhere else?

1095
01:08:33,589 --> 01:08:35,181
Wow! lt's so beautiful!

1096
01:08:35,258 --> 01:08:38,193
l always used to dream about
living in such a house.

1097
01:08:38,261 --> 01:08:40,525
lt's so natural! So green!

1098
01:08:41,364 --> 01:08:43,229
Such pure oxygen!

1099
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:46,461
And such pure cowdung!

1100
01:08:46,969 --> 01:08:50,200
Maahi and Kabir will tend to it.

1101
01:09:07,990 --> 01:09:10,584
You pickpocket! - Do
you wear spectacles?

1102
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:14,327
One-two, three-four, five-six,
seven-eight, nine-ten..

1103
01:09:23,472 --> 01:09:25,167
Oh!

1104
01:09:31,347 --> 01:09:32,644
Cheers!

1105
01:09:36,752 --> 01:09:39,619
Friend, we'll leave. You are
on your own now. - Thanks.

1106
01:09:39,789 --> 01:09:42,349
Thanks for everything. You
all are true friends.

1107
01:09:43,192 --> 01:09:44,659
Bye then! - Bye!

1108
01:09:44,860 --> 01:09:46,851
Bye! - Bye! Take care.

1109
01:09:53,936 --> 01:09:56,928
Welcome, advocate. l don't
know why l felt..

1110
01:09:57,206 --> 01:09:58,639
..that you would certainly
come to my house.

1111
01:09:58,741 --> 01:10:02,199
You made me very happy
by coming here.

1112
01:10:02,278 --> 01:10:04,473
Greetings. lt's good
that you came.

1113
01:10:04,780 --> 01:10:06,907
Now the kids have made
a mistake but..

1114
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:08,877
..we must work with
understanding.

1115
01:10:08,985 --> 01:10:11,783
Here, please sit advocate.
Sit sister.

1116
01:10:12,622 --> 01:10:14,886
Where is Maahi? - Maahi?

1117
01:10:16,692 --> 01:10:18,819
l understand your cleverness.

1118
01:10:20,229 --> 01:10:22,720
You came to my office
to blackmail me.

1119
01:10:24,667 --> 01:10:26,157
When you couldn't get
me by sweet-talk..

1120
01:10:26,235 --> 01:10:27,896
..you had my daughter abducted!

1121
01:10:29,205 --> 01:10:31,230
You don't know me. My
name is Mohit Puri.

1122
01:10:31,674 --> 01:10:34,165
You won't get a single penny
from me, understand?

1123
01:10:35,378 --> 01:10:37,346
lnstead, l'll have a case
against you of kidnapping..

1124
01:10:37,513 --> 01:10:39,276
..and against your son of rape.

1125
01:10:39,582 --> 01:10:43,814
Rape! - Wait.. -l will make sure
you people slog in prison.

1126
01:10:44,287 --> 01:10:47,188
Husband.. - Have patience!
Patience.

1127
01:10:48,224 --> 01:10:49,953
He puts us through
tests sometimes.

1128
01:10:50,293 --> 01:10:52,955
lf you clear them,
He rewards us too.

1129
01:10:54,397 --> 01:10:55,864
Well, advocate.

1130
01:10:56,499 --> 01:10:59,195
l am a freaky brained
infamous man.

1131
01:10:59,669 --> 01:11:02,297
l speak in the same tone as
a person who threatens me.

1132
01:11:02,438 --> 01:11:03,962
How? Threateningly!

1133
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:07,470
Still, l am sadly taking
in your insults.

1134
01:11:07,877 --> 01:11:10,641
The only reason being that now
l am not only worried..

1135
01:11:10,780 --> 01:11:12,543
..about my son but also
your daughter.

1136
01:11:12,682 --> 01:11:15,651
lf you see it that way, even
she is my child now.

1137
01:11:16,319 --> 01:11:17,616
l came to you with a
humble request to..

1138
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:19,881
..beg for the children's
happiness. l told you that..

1139
01:11:19,989 --> 01:11:21,479
..the matter would get worse
by getting angry.

1140
01:11:21,624 --> 01:11:23,319
You didn't listen to me at all.

1141
01:11:23,526 --> 01:11:27,690
Now l am scared that what you
say may turn out to be true.

1142
01:11:28,230 --> 01:11:30,528
l hope the kids may not have
gone somewhere afar.

1143
01:11:30,633 --> 01:11:32,897
Kuku hasn't come home
from two days either.

1144
01:11:33,836 --> 01:11:36,703
Pakhi, call the police
now. Call DCP Baruga.

1145
01:11:38,174 --> 01:11:41,940
l'll change my name if l don't
make you rot in jail today.

1146
01:11:42,378 --> 01:11:45,609
Why do you keep saying that?

1147
01:11:45,948 --> 01:11:47,939
What is your name? Mohit Puri.

1148
01:11:48,451 --> 01:11:50,180
lt's similar to something
edible.

1149
01:11:50,252 --> 01:11:52,652
Listen. - Are you a
man or fried bread?

1150
01:11:52,855 --> 01:11:54,652
lf this lady wasn't with you,..

1151
01:11:54,757 --> 01:11:56,622
..l would have pushed you
out by now. -Shut up!

1152
01:11:56,726 --> 01:11:57,920
You shut up!

1153
01:11:58,728 --> 01:12:01,697
Get out of my house! Get lost!

1154
01:12:01,831 --> 01:12:03,958
Don't push me, get it? - l'll
hit you with a shoe!

1155
01:12:04,233 --> 01:12:06,497
You bloody idiot! - You'll
send me to prison?

1156
01:12:06,736 --> 01:12:09,671
l'll show you. - Change your
name to fried bread.

1157
01:12:10,806 --> 01:12:12,296
You hit me!

1158
01:12:12,408 --> 01:12:15,343
l'll push you back from
where you came!

1159
01:12:15,978 --> 01:12:17,809
Don't! Don't do that!

1160
01:12:21,484 --> 01:12:22,951
l'll bash you up for good!

1161
01:12:23,219 --> 01:12:26,416
l'll hit you so much
that.. take this!

1162
01:12:26,522 --> 01:12:28,456
What do you think of yourself?

1163
01:12:29,191 --> 01:12:31,625
You'll take me to prison?
- Let's get out of here.

1164
01:12:32,461 --> 01:12:34,725
You've had it now.
You've had it!

1165
01:12:34,897 --> 01:12:36,524
l'll have you imprisoned
for 20 years.

1166
01:12:36,665 --> 01:12:37,757
She's my only daughter.

1167
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:40,630
Would you have let them
go if they were three?

1168
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:43,604
You make stupid statements and
call yourself a lawyer?

1169
01:12:50,646 --> 01:12:52,807
Sir, the in-charge here
is inspector Singh.

1170
01:12:53,182 --> 01:12:54,615
l have made him listen.

1171
01:12:54,884 --> 01:12:57,785
He says that if both the parties
hug and end the dispute..

1172
01:12:58,220 --> 01:12:59,710
..he'll cancel the complaint.

1173
01:12:59,855 --> 01:13:02,915
You're asking me to hug him.
l'm thinking of killing him.

1174
01:13:03,192 --> 01:13:05,456
Understand the nature of
the situation, sir.

1175
01:13:05,761 --> 01:13:07,490
There are so many media-persons
outside.

1176
01:13:07,563 --> 01:13:10,896
lf any of them finds out
about this case..

1177
01:13:11,367 --> 01:13:13,631
..your photos will be
seen in newspapers.

1178
01:13:13,969 --> 01:13:16,631
Sir, that rickshaw-driver
won't lose anything.

1179
01:13:16,972 --> 01:13:19,406
You will be defamed in the
society.. - Fine. Alright.

1180
01:13:19,508 --> 01:13:23,444
Welcome lawyers! Mr. Puri.

1181
01:13:23,712 --> 01:13:27,148
l'm fortunate to have you here
in my police station.

1182
01:13:27,216 --> 01:13:30,811
The station is happy too, sir.
Why did you do this though?

1183
01:13:31,187 --> 01:13:33,314
You broke the law even though
you are a man of law.

1184
01:13:33,489 --> 01:13:36,219
You entered a poor man's
house? Trespassing?

1185
01:13:37,226 --> 01:13:40,218
Get up Punjabi and embrace him.

1186
01:13:41,497 --> 01:13:43,294
Get up. - Embrace him friend.

1187
01:13:43,466 --> 01:13:45,593
You cannot go around the
courts all the time.

1188
01:13:45,734 --> 01:13:48,202
lt was a small matter
of misunderstanding.

1189
01:13:48,337 --> 01:13:50,271
lt has been cleared.
Come on, stand up.

1190
01:13:50,339 --> 01:13:52,773
l'm willing to shake hands with
him. What is his problem?

1191
01:13:54,376 --> 01:13:55,809
Come on Mohit.

1192
01:13:58,848 --> 01:14:00,247
Embrace him.

1193
01:14:01,383 --> 01:14:04,546
ls that it? l haven't torn
this complaint copy yet.

1194
01:14:05,621 --> 01:14:07,486
Come on Mohit. - Agree with him.

1195
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:12,794
When your worthless boy comes
before me the next time..

1196
01:14:12,862 --> 01:14:14,193
..he won't survive it.

1197
01:14:14,296 --> 01:14:16,196
lf my son is despicable what
is your daughter like?

1198
01:14:16,265 --> 01:14:17,755
Talk with caution, Punjabi.

1199
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:21,893
Fried bread, if you come to me
again l'll destroy your eyes.

1200
01:14:22,304 --> 01:14:24,738
lf l see you again, l'll shoot
you first and then question.

1201
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:26,637
l have seen many people
who can shoot.

1202
01:14:26,775 --> 01:14:28,868
l'll strangle you
and get hanged.

1203
01:14:29,345 --> 01:14:30,607
Shut up! - Shut up!

1204
01:14:30,779 --> 01:14:33,213
Buy them! Sweet berries
for five rupees.

1205
01:14:33,282 --> 01:14:35,250
Berries. A whole bunch
for five rupees.

1206
01:14:35,351 --> 01:14:37,478
Madam, they are sweet
berries. -Pay them.

1207
01:14:39,421 --> 01:14:41,218
Give me this one. - Ten rupees.

1208
01:14:42,224 --> 01:14:44,158
Candles! Come here!

1209
01:14:44,326 --> 01:14:45,486
They are beautiful
candles, right?

1210
01:14:45,561 --> 01:14:46,721
Madam, they are speciality here.

1211
01:14:46,896 --> 01:14:49,888
Many foreigners buy them
and pay us in dollars.

1212
01:14:50,165 --> 01:14:52,599
lf you burn them during night
your dinner will be romantic.

1213
01:14:52,701 --> 01:14:54,293
Ok, l'll buy them.

1214
01:14:58,607 --> 01:14:59,665
Maahi.

1215
01:15:01,377 --> 01:15:03,743
After some days your stomach
will look like this.

1216
01:15:03,879 --> 01:15:05,176
Stupid.

1217
01:15:19,428 --> 01:15:21,896
My card has been cancelled.
How's that?

1218
01:15:25,734 --> 01:15:28,134
l know it. Papa must have
had it cancelled.

1219
01:15:28,470 --> 01:15:32,201
He thinks l'll be scared
and come back home.

1220
01:15:32,408 --> 01:15:34,774
Why should l be afraid?
You are with me, right?

1221
01:15:34,877 --> 01:15:38,335
Of course. - Then l am not
afraid of anything.

1222
01:15:38,814 --> 01:15:42,545
lt is said that.. courage
something.. and God?

1223
01:15:42,751 --> 01:15:44,719
lf you have courage,
God will help you.

1224
01:15:45,454 --> 01:15:46,819
Correct. Let's go.

1225
01:15:50,726 --> 01:15:52,387
Wow! lt's so good here.

1226
01:15:52,528 --> 01:15:55,520
l wish to spend my entire
life here. - Me too.

1227
01:15:56,165 --> 01:15:58,565
l was thinking about cleaning
up the stuff there..

1228
01:15:58,734 --> 01:16:00,395
..and growing some
nice vegetables.

1229
01:16:00,536 --> 01:16:03,164
Eggplant, lady's-finger,
cucumber.. -Candy.

1230
01:16:03,539 --> 01:16:05,632
What? -We can grow
candy too, right?

1231
01:16:05,774 --> 01:16:08,242
Candy and chocolate.
-Shut up duffer!

1232
01:16:08,877 --> 01:16:11,903
lt feels so good, right?
Just like a dream.

1233
01:16:12,481 --> 01:16:13,573
Have you heard that proverb..

1234
01:16:13,682 --> 01:16:16,310
'lf there is heaven on
earth, it is here.'

1235
01:16:16,418 --> 01:16:17,476
'lt's here. lt's here.'

1236
01:16:17,586 --> 01:16:20,851
You are my only companion.
Only you, only you.

1237
01:16:20,956 --> 01:16:22,548
You're so clever!

1238
01:16:23,258 --> 01:16:24,623
Oh God! lt started
raining suddenly.

1239
01:16:24,693 --> 01:16:25,955
Give the candle. -Forget the candle.

1240
01:16:26,228 --> 01:16:27,718
Let's go! - Ok, run!

1241
01:16:29,865 --> 01:16:31,230
Come on. Let's go upstairs.

1242
01:16:31,667 --> 01:16:33,191
Oh shit! - Oh God!

1243
01:16:34,770 --> 01:16:36,761
Close that window first. - Yes.

1244
01:16:48,384 --> 01:16:51,217
The entire house is leaking.

1245
01:16:52,287 --> 01:16:54,482
We'll have to put a plastic
sheet on the roof.

1246
01:16:54,823 --> 01:16:57,485
You are completely wet. Wait!

1247
01:16:58,994 --> 01:17:01,485
Come here. -Thank you.

1248
01:17:02,431 --> 01:17:04,228
We shouldn't have said
our dream aloud.

1249
01:17:04,333 --> 01:17:05,925
Dreams are shattered that way.

1250
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:13,801
Come on, Maahi. Don't be silly.

1251
01:17:14,543 --> 01:17:17,637
l'm mad. l simply got you
to spend so much money.

1252
01:17:17,946 --> 01:17:19,709
There was no need
to buy candles.

1253
01:17:19,848 --> 01:17:21,008
lt's already done.

1254
01:17:21,950 --> 01:17:24,384
You aren't mad, right?
Why did you stop me?

1255
01:17:25,354 --> 01:17:26,651
You were very happy.

1256
01:17:26,922 --> 01:17:28,446
Now l am getting sad.

1257
01:17:30,592 --> 01:17:34,187
How much money do we have?
- About 250-300.

1258
01:17:36,832 --> 01:17:40,233
This is a big difficulty.
Your money is all over.

1259
01:17:40,436 --> 01:17:42,199
My card has been cancelled too.

1260
01:17:42,838 --> 01:17:44,533
What now? -Don't worry, Maahi.

1261
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:46,369
l was anyway thinking about
looking for a job.

1262
01:17:46,475 --> 01:17:49,376
So that l can earn money. After
all we are going to be parents.

1263
01:17:49,678 --> 01:17:51,839
We will have to understand
our responsibility.

1264
01:17:52,347 --> 01:17:53,678
You're so cute.

1265
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:57,443
Here.

1266
01:17:58,220 --> 01:18:00,654
Get a nice job. - Fine.

1267
01:18:01,590 --> 01:18:03,524
One that gets us a lot of money.

1268
01:18:03,992 --> 01:18:06,654
Alright. - l'll be
waiting for you.

1269
01:18:06,862 --> 01:18:09,262
l'll prepare food
too. - Ok, bye.

1270
01:18:09,398 --> 01:18:10,558
Bye!

1271
01:18:13,736 --> 01:18:14,828

1272
01:18:17,539 --> 01:18:20,337
Brother, will l get some
work here which is good.

What work do you know?

1274
01:18:22,811 --> 01:18:25,177
l don't know about any
but l can do anything.

1275
01:18:25,247 --> 01:18:26,339
Go to the market there.

1276
01:18:26,415 --> 01:18:29,213
A truck takes labourers and goes
to a construction site.

1277
01:18:29,351 --> 01:18:31,410
l don't think it's left yet.
Rush you could still catch it.

1278
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:34,646
Thank you, brother.

Vishnu.

1285

Use your brains while working
or you'll be finished today.

1286
01:19:01,216 --> 01:19:03,480
God! Will l have to use
brains for this work?

1287
01:19:09,925 --> 01:19:11,483
Get aside. Let me go.

1288
01:19:29,778 --> 01:19:30,870
Come on.

1289
01:19:32,247 --> 01:19:34,909
Already tired? You have
to get 20 more sacks.

1290
01:19:47,429 --> 01:19:50,330
Be careful. Do you want to
die? Look up and work!

1291
01:19:50,465 --> 01:19:52,729
What if something fatal would
have happened now?

1292
01:20:05,447 --> 01:20:07,472
Shyamlal. Take 300 rupees.

1293

01:20:15,457 --> 01:20:17,482
Listen. This is tough
manual labour.

1295
01:20:17,626 --> 01:20:19,787
You cannot do it. Don't
come from tomorrow.

1296
01:20:20,262 --> 01:20:22,253
No, l'll do it. - Uttamchand.

1297
01:20:23,232 --> 01:20:32,197
For your love, my beloved.. l

1298
01:20:34,243 --> 01:20:38,805

You are very late.

1305
01:21:07,976 --> 01:21:10,536
Did you have to complete
all work in one day?

1306
01:21:14,883 --> 01:21:16,350
ls that all?

1307
01:21:18,253 --> 01:21:21,620
No, it's enough. We'll
reduce our expenses.

1308
01:21:21,890 --> 01:21:25,155

No. l got a job on a
construction site.

1316
01:22:20,749 --> 01:22:22,614

1317
01:22:22,851 --> 01:22:26,548
l'll get used to it later.
Don't worry. Ok?

1318
01:22:29,458 --> 01:22:30,516
Ok.

1319
01:22:39,334 --> 01:22:40,494

Sorry sir. l'm late today.

You won't get work here today.

1334
01:24:01,216 --> 01:24:03,377
The labour required for
the day is complete.

1335
01:24:04,419 --> 01:24:06,512
Anyway, this work isn't
easy for you.

1336
01:24:06,655 --> 01:24:08,213
From where have you come?

1337
01:24:08,890 --> 01:24:10,721
You are not originally
from here.

1338
01:24:11,626 --> 01:24:13,423
Have you run from your house?

1339
01:24:16,398 --> 01:24:17,524
Listen.

1340
01:24:19,468 --> 01:24:20,526
Yes?

1341
01:24:20,769 --> 01:24:22,669
Mr. Mukund has a gas agency
in the village.

1342
01:24:22,838 --> 01:24:24,362
He said that he needed
a delivery man.

1343
01:24:24,439 --> 01:24:26,566
Go and meet him. Say
Thapa sent you.

Thank you sir. Thank
you. - lt's ok.

Do you know how to ride
a cycle? - First class.

1346
01:24:38,153 --> 01:24:40,713
Very good. You'll have to travel
with a full cylinder.

1347
01:24:41,156 --> 01:24:42,487
You'll have to get
an empty one back.

1348
01:24:42,591 --> 01:24:44,149
Have you ever changed
gas cylinders?

1349
01:24:44,259 --> 01:24:45,692
Yes, l used to do
it at my house.

1350
01:24:45,794 --> 01:24:47,159
Bring a cylinder.

1351
01:24:47,829 --> 01:24:48,921

Ok. You'll get your wages

l'll keep an amount as security
for five days.

1354
01:24:54,703 --> 01:24:56,170
What's the security for?

1355
01:24:56,238 --> 01:24:58,900
What if the cycle breaks
or you disappear?

1356
01:24:59,508 --> 01:25:01,738
Otherwise forget it. - No,
no! l'll do it, sir.

1357
01:25:03,245 --> 01:25:05,770
Here's the address.
Take it and leave.

1358
01:25:10,352 --> 01:25:11,910
There's place for another one.

1359
01:25:14,856 --> 01:25:17,188
Sir, doesn't the cycle
have a bell?

1360
01:25:20,729 --> 01:25:22,959
There's this gong. lt can be
heard from half a mile away.

1361
01:25:23,198 --> 01:25:24,290
Leave now.

1362
01:25:26,601 --> 01:25:27,727
Be careful.

1363
01:25:31,506 --> 01:25:32,768
Go carefully.

1364
01:26:06,174 --> 01:26:07,505
Berries! Sweet berries!

1365
01:26:07,609 --> 01:26:11,170
They are as sweet as sugar,
sir! A lot for five rupees!

1366
01:26:11,279 --> 01:26:15,340
Buy them! Buy it! Buy
it for five rupees!

1367
01:26:16,318 --> 01:26:18,343
Buy it! Buy it!

1368
01:26:21,256 --> 01:26:22,746
Sweet berries!

1369
01:26:28,296 --> 01:26:30,230
Hi Maahi. - Hi.

1370
01:26:30,432 --> 01:26:32,627
What have you brought? -
lt's today's newspaper.

1371
01:26:32,801 --> 01:26:34,962
My employer read and threw
it. So l brought it over.

1372
01:26:35,237 --> 01:26:36,898
My new employer, Mr. Mukund..

1373
01:26:37,205 --> 01:26:39,639
..has given me a job of
delivering gas cylinders.

1374
01:26:39,741 --> 01:26:42,335
He puts three or four cylinders
on the cycle at one time.

1375
01:26:42,477 --> 01:26:45,605
This cycle is completely busted.

1376
01:26:46,214 --> 01:26:47,943
Sorry. lt doesn't
even have brakes.

1377
01:26:48,250 --> 01:26:51,242
When it comes down a decline,
l can't get down or stop it.

1378
01:26:51,453 --> 01:26:54,616
My heart beats wildly
and butt hurts.

1379
01:26:54,956 --> 01:26:56,583
Yes, l saw it.

1380
01:26:56,858 --> 01:26:59,224
You saw it? When did you see?

1381
01:26:59,394 --> 01:27:01,988
The place from where you bought
a flute and l ate berries.

1382
01:27:02,530 --> 01:27:05,328
Did you go to buy berries there?

1383
01:27:05,867 --> 01:27:07,425
No, to sell them.

1384
01:27:08,470 --> 01:27:10,961
Stop this chatter now
and wash yourself!

1385
01:27:11,239 --> 01:27:12,763
The food is getting
cold. - Stop it.

1386
01:27:13,241 --> 01:27:15,471
Come on! - l'll get a cold.

1387
01:27:18,780 --> 01:27:20,714
Tell me, what have l made today?

1388
01:27:23,718 --> 01:27:25,185
Navratan Pulav!

1389
01:27:26,821 --> 01:27:29,255
Maahi, don't waste money.

1390
01:27:29,524 --> 01:27:31,685
l'm going to get my salary
after five days.

1391
01:27:32,193 --> 01:27:34,354
lt's ok. l have made
arrangements.

1392
01:27:35,196 --> 01:27:36,254
Eat it.

1393
01:27:37,599 --> 01:27:38,759
Anything..

1394
01:27:54,215 --> 01:27:56,206
Maahi, our parents must
be very worried.

1395
01:27:57,886 --> 01:28:00,377
l wish l could tell them that
l am having fun here.

1396
01:28:01,523 --> 01:28:03,650
You should have made
your phone roaming.

1397
01:28:06,895 --> 01:28:09,261
l got Kuku such an
expensive phone..

1398
01:28:09,597 --> 01:28:12,293
..still l get 'out of
reach' announcements.

1399
01:28:13,868 --> 01:28:16,803
Ask the phone company and find
out where is our boy.

1400
01:28:18,239 --> 01:28:20,230
Sushma, you are going crazy.

1401
01:28:21,309 --> 01:28:25,177
All those people can tell us is
that the phone isn't nearby.

1402
01:28:25,313 --> 01:28:27,304
They cannot give us
Kuku's address.

1403
01:28:27,515 --> 01:28:30,382
Keep giving excuses. You
don't care a bit.

1404
01:28:31,519 --> 01:28:35,216
l can only worry. There is
nothing else l can do.

1405
01:28:36,324 --> 01:28:38,952
Call them from the village
PCO tomorrow. Ok?

1406
01:28:39,461 --> 01:28:42,726
No. Your father must be surely
interrogating my dad.

1407
01:28:43,398 --> 01:28:46,231
lf l call them everyone
will know about us.

1408
01:28:47,535 --> 01:28:49,435
Calling them is not a good idea.

1409
01:28:49,537 --> 01:28:52,370
l'm thinking of meeting the
advocate. Mohit Fried Bread.

1410
01:28:52,807 --> 01:28:55,605
Maybe he got some news about his
daughter. -No, absolutely not.

1411
01:28:55,710 --> 01:28:57,610
We don't want to see his face.

1412
01:28:59,447 --> 01:29:00,971
Our son will return.

1413
01:29:01,516 --> 01:29:03,814
Where will he stay away from
home for many days?

1414
01:29:05,820 --> 01:29:07,981
He cannot stay without
me for two days.

1415
01:29:09,791 --> 01:29:11,554
He will come in a while.

1416
01:29:14,396 --> 01:29:18,423
Kuku, have we made a
mistake by eloping?

1417
01:29:19,934 --> 01:29:21,333
l don't know.

1418
01:29:22,737 --> 01:29:24,705
What other way did
we have though?

1419
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:27,865
Yeah. That's true again.

1420
01:29:30,745 --> 01:29:33,578
Well, let's not talk
about it. - Ok.

1421
01:29:35,417 --> 01:29:37,612
Goodnight. - Goodnight.

1422
01:30:10,285 --> 01:30:18,715
My friend, my partner.

1423
01:30:20,762 --> 01:30:25,165
You gave me faith.

1424
01:30:25,767 --> 01:30:30,431
You accepted me from
your heart.

1425
01:30:30,872 --> 01:30:35,309
You are my love and life.

1426
01:30:35,910 --> 01:30:39,539
Let's admit being
in love today.

1427
01:30:41,182 --> 01:30:45,812
l have found God. l have
got everything.

1428
01:30:46,287 --> 01:30:49,848
When l have your love..

1429
01:30:50,291 --> 01:30:56,230
l have found God. l have
got everything.

1430
01:30:56,531 --> 01:31:00,365
When l have your love..

1431
01:31:16,851 --> 01:31:21,720
l'll bear all sorrow and
give you happiness.

1432
01:31:22,223 --> 01:31:26,216
For you, l'd give
up the world.

1433
01:31:27,161 --> 01:31:32,155
l'll bear all sorrow and
give you happiness.

1434
01:31:32,367 --> 01:31:35,894
For you, l'd give
up the world.

1435
01:31:36,271 --> 01:31:38,603
l have found God!

1436
01:31:43,444 --> 01:31:45,708
l have found God!

1437
01:31:47,682 --> 01:31:56,681
l found God when
l got your love.

1438
01:31:57,892 --> 01:32:02,329
You are my love and life.

1439
01:32:03,197 --> 01:32:06,894
Let's admit being
in love today.

1440
01:32:07,201 --> 01:32:12,298
l have found God. l have
got everything.

1441
01:32:12,440 --> 01:32:17,605
When l have your love..

1442
01:32:23,818 --> 01:32:25,513
Jeet Khatri. - Yes madam.

1443
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:27,444
Kabir Punjabi.

1444
01:32:29,257 --> 01:32:30,656
He hasn't come today too?

1445
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:34,253
Mushtaq, Ramesh, Satbir..

1446
01:32:34,662 --> 01:32:36,357
You must know where Kabir is.

1447
01:32:37,632 --> 01:32:38,894
No madam. - No madam.

1448
01:32:41,703 --> 01:32:42,795
Maahi.

1449
01:32:50,211 --> 01:32:51,269
Maahi!

1450
01:32:53,314 --> 01:32:54,372
Maahi.

1451
01:32:55,650 --> 01:32:57,242
What have you brought?

1452
01:32:57,352 --> 01:32:59,718
l served a English
couple last month.

1453
01:32:59,921 --> 01:33:02,583
They gave me this pram before
leaving. lsn't it nice?

1454
01:33:03,358 --> 01:33:05,519
Do you think about anything else
other than the baby these days?

1455
01:33:05,727 --> 01:33:07,285
Why are you getting jealous?

1456
01:33:08,396 --> 01:33:10,591
What happened Maahi? - The
goon is kicking me.

1457
01:33:10,698 --> 01:33:12,825
Why are you kicking her?

1458
01:33:13,568 --> 01:33:14,626
What?

1459
01:33:14,802 --> 01:33:17,327
lt is asking how you'd know
whether its male or female?

1460
01:33:18,406 --> 01:33:20,340
Come on, for now l'll keep this
in the store room. -No!

1461
01:33:20,408 --> 01:33:23,536
Not there. ls a child's pram
to be kept in the attic?

1462
01:33:24,245 --> 01:33:26,475
Take it to my room. When
it is before me..

1463
01:33:26,547 --> 01:33:29,539
..l'll be happy to see
it. -Alright, ok.

1464
01:34:08,256 --> 01:34:10,190
Our expenses will increase
once the child comes.

1465
01:34:10,258 --> 01:34:12,818
ls there is any problem
if l earn some money?

1466
01:34:12,927 --> 01:34:15,395
l'll earn and get more
than enough money..

1467
01:34:15,563 --> 01:34:18,555
..but you won't work. Look
at your condition.

1468
01:34:18,766 --> 01:34:21,735
You don't have any energy and l
don't see enough blood in you.

1469
01:34:21,969 --> 01:34:24,802
Look Maahi, rest and take
care of yourself.

1470
01:34:25,206 --> 01:34:27,140
All this while you slog
day and night.

1471
01:34:27,275 --> 01:34:29,243
How much will you work, Kuku?

1472
01:34:29,377 --> 01:34:31,675
l'll do whatever is necessary
for the child.

1473
01:34:32,146 --> 01:34:33,670
l won't hear your arguments
from now on.

1474
01:34:33,781 --> 01:34:35,271
Go to sleep quietly.

1475
01:34:36,250 --> 01:34:38,718
You're so bad. - Yeah, l know.

1476
01:34:42,857 --> 01:34:44,324
Yes, DCP Baruga.

1477
01:34:45,526 --> 01:34:48,359
You said that you know Delhi
like the back of your hand.

1478
01:34:48,529 --> 01:34:51,191
You'd get them in two days.
What happened then?

1479
01:34:51,332 --> 01:34:53,163
You didn't complain and..

1480
01:34:53,201 --> 01:34:55,396
..had action stopped on
our behalf, Mr. Puri.

1481
01:34:55,636 --> 01:34:58,571
You say that negative publicity
shouldn't be done.

1482
01:34:58,806 --> 01:35:00,330
You'd be defamed unnecessarily.

1483
01:35:00,441 --> 01:35:02,932
l can spread the news everywhere
if you ask for it.

1484
01:35:03,377 --> 01:35:07,473
lf required, we can also show
photos on newspapers and TV.

1485
01:35:08,216 --> 01:35:10,411
No. l'll tell you later.

1486
01:35:11,385 --> 01:35:13,580
Yeah. l'll tell you..
but keep trying, ok?

1487
01:35:14,288 --> 01:35:16,222
When will you do
it, Mohit? When?

1488
01:35:17,425 --> 01:35:19,552
l don't know why you have
this fake pride.

1489
01:35:20,428 --> 01:35:23,192
You don't care about the
condition of our daughter.

1490
01:35:28,169 --> 01:35:29,500
Hi. - Hi.

1491
01:35:29,670 --> 01:35:30,796
What's so funny?

1492
01:35:31,472 --> 01:35:33,303
Look, there is funny news.

1493
01:35:33,441 --> 01:35:35,739
A man had a son who
was feverish.

1494
01:35:36,144 --> 01:35:37,873
So he took him and put
him in a freezer..

1495
01:35:38,146 --> 01:35:39,807
..so that he cools down quickly.

1496
01:35:40,181 --> 01:35:41,409
How stupid?

1497
01:35:42,750 --> 01:35:45,446
What should we do? - About what?

1498
01:35:46,654 --> 01:35:49,919
The same. lf a child has fever,
what should be done?

1499
01:35:51,893 --> 01:35:54,726
l don't know. A freezer
shouldn't be used though.

1500
01:35:56,364 --> 01:35:58,594
There is another bit of
news on the same page.

1501
01:35:59,167 --> 01:36:02,295
Look, a man has put on an
offer over the internet..

1502
01:36:02,436 --> 01:36:04,734
..for someone to come over
and take his child.

1503
01:36:05,673 --> 01:36:08,164
The poor man doesn't have money.

1504
01:36:09,243 --> 01:36:11,643
He can't even buy things
the kid needs.

1505
01:36:13,181 --> 01:36:15,274
The kid keeps crying
all the time.

1506
01:36:15,783 --> 01:36:17,808
He doesn't have a mother
living either.

1507
01:36:18,820 --> 01:36:21,186
That man doesn't know
to nurture a child.

1508
01:36:26,194 --> 01:36:27,252
Sad.

1509
01:36:29,397 --> 01:36:30,489
Maahi.

1510
01:36:31,866 --> 01:36:34,960
We will not give our child
to anyone. Never.

1511
01:36:37,405 --> 01:36:39,771
Correct. We will nurture it.

1512
01:36:40,474 --> 01:36:42,442
lf we don't know how
to, we'll learn.

1513
01:36:42,910 --> 01:36:45,640
We will never give him
to anyone though.

1514
01:36:46,380 --> 01:36:47,608
Absolutely not.

1515
01:36:49,417 --> 01:36:50,645
What happened, Maahi?

1516
01:36:50,751 --> 01:36:52,309
l don't know. lt started
hurting suddenly.

1517
01:36:52,420 --> 01:36:55,480
Come, come! Lie down for
a while and relax.

1518
01:36:56,490 --> 01:36:57,548
Lie down.

1519
01:36:58,860 --> 01:37:02,352
Oh God! l can't even
lie down, Kuku!

1520
01:37:02,697 --> 01:37:04,688
Come on then. l'll take
you to a doctor. Come.

1521
01:37:04,799 --> 01:37:06,699
No. l won't be able to
walk either, Kuku!

1522
01:37:06,801 --> 01:37:08,291
Ok, don't worry. Come.

1523
01:37:11,472 --> 01:37:13,406
Mummy! - Maahi, relax.
Everything will be fine.

1524
01:37:13,507 --> 01:37:16,271
Mummy! - Please help us. -Yes.
Come this way. - Doctor!

1525
01:37:16,344 --> 01:37:17,436
Be careful.

1526
01:37:23,951 --> 01:37:25,316
Doctor?

1527
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:28,351
Your child is completely fine.

1528
01:37:29,891 --> 01:37:33,520
This is the child's heartbeats.
Do you want to hear them?

1529
01:37:41,335 --> 01:37:43,235
Doctor, please call Kuku.

1530
01:37:43,337 --> 01:37:44,804
He has been standing outside
since a long time.

1531
01:37:44,872 --> 01:37:47,602
Nurse, send the boy
in. - Yes madam.

1532
01:37:52,380 --> 01:37:53,506
Doctor.

1533
01:38:08,896 --> 01:38:10,625
Your child is alright.

1534
01:38:11,265 --> 01:38:13,665
That is your child's heartbeat.

1535
01:38:15,469 --> 01:38:16,834
The goon scared us.

1536
01:38:17,238 --> 01:38:18,899
Doctor, why was she in pain?

1537
01:38:19,340 --> 01:38:21,240
There must have been
some excitement.

1538
01:38:21,442 --> 01:38:23,376
l'll prescribe some medicines
and a tonic.

1539
01:38:23,544 --> 01:38:24,909
Give it to her on time.

1540
01:38:26,781 --> 01:38:29,272
Eat well and think
about good things.

1541
01:38:29,517 --> 01:38:31,508
No tension, no hard-work.

1542
01:38:31,652 --> 01:38:34,280
Understand, baby? -Did you
understand, baby's mother?

1543
01:38:34,555 --> 01:38:36,318
l understood it, baby's dad.

1544
01:38:43,264 --> 01:38:44,891

Mr. Puri, do you think

1559
01:40:11,218 --> 01:40:13,482
..Kabir Punjabi has kidnapped
your daughter?

1560
01:40:13,587 --> 01:40:16,420
Look, all l want to say is
that whatever happened..

01:40:16,524 --> 01:40:18,754
..was very unfortunate
and l just want..

1562
01:40:18,859 --> 01:40:22,454
Mr. Puri, do you want Kabir
Punjabi to be arrested?

1563
01:40:23,230 --> 01:40:26,757
l want my daughter to
come home safely.

1564
01:40:27,234 --> 01:40:28,826
l just want my daughter
to come back home.

1565
01:40:29,170 --> 01:40:33,402
lf anyone has Maahi Puri's
information..

1566
01:40:33,507 --> 01:40:36,203
..please contact the
police. That's all.

1567
01:40:40,381 --> 01:40:43,316
Maahi, if you can hear this
please come back home.

1568
01:40:43,584 --> 01:40:46,212
Nothing.. there's no revenge.
Just come back.

1569
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:48,481
l just want my daughter
to come back home..

1570
01:40:48,789 --> 01:40:51,485
..whether it is Kabir Punjabi
or anyone who has done it.

1571
01:40:51,859 --> 01:40:55,226
Maahi l saw this magazine
in the market.

1572
01:40:58,699 --> 01:41:00,394
Rape? Kidnapping?

1573
01:41:00,768 --> 01:41:03,498
My God! Kuku.. - Cool down.

1574
01:41:04,238 --> 01:41:05,933
There was your father's
interview on TV too.

1575
01:41:06,207 --> 01:41:07,834
There was our photo
given as well.

1576
01:41:08,476 --> 01:41:09,738
What now? - Nothing.

1577
01:41:09,944 --> 01:41:11,536
There will be a new
issue next week.

1578
01:41:11,645 --> 01:41:14,239
New news will come on TV.
People will forget it.

1579
01:41:15,249 --> 01:41:17,479
Maahi. Relax.

1580
01:41:17,885 --> 01:41:21,252
Don't worry. Such news
is printed every day.

1581
01:41:21,489 --> 01:41:24,720
People listen to them as they're
hot then they forget them, ok?

1582
01:41:26,927 --> 01:41:29,760
We will just have to stay
home for some days now.

1583
01:41:29,930 --> 01:41:31,557
There is danger to go outside.

1584
01:41:31,665 --> 01:41:33,496
l'm feeling very bad
for you Kuku.

1585
01:41:33,834 --> 01:41:35,301
lt's alright.

1586
01:41:37,605 --> 01:41:38,731
lt'll be fine.

1587
01:41:51,585 --> 01:41:55,954
l have found God..
l have found God..

1588
01:42:48,709 --> 01:42:51,678
We shouldn't be separated.

1589
01:42:53,747 --> 01:42:56,307
We must be hand in hand.

1590
01:42:58,652 --> 01:43:02,679
My beloved shouldn't
be annoyed with me.

1591
01:43:04,825 --> 01:43:07,293
l have found God.

1592
01:43:15,436 --> 01:43:18,405
What can l do, Sushma?
Tell me what l can do.

1593
01:43:19,273 --> 01:43:21,673
Even that lawyer is
doing nothing much.

1594
01:43:22,309 --> 01:43:25,142
lf there was a way of finding
out, he would have known by now.

1595
01:43:25,512 --> 01:43:27,207
He doesn't know anything.

1596
01:43:27,715 --> 01:43:29,683
After all it is about
his daughter.

1597
01:43:30,551 --> 01:43:33,543
Just pray that wherever the kids
may be, they may be safe.

1598
01:43:33,754 --> 01:43:35,881
They shouldn't face any problem.

1599
01:43:36,790 --> 01:43:39,452
Oh god! -Uncle, may we leave?

1600
01:43:40,261 --> 01:43:41,319
Ok.

1601
01:43:41,895 --> 01:43:43,726
Leave that newspaper here.

1602
01:43:44,665 --> 01:43:47,361
Ok aunt. - Be happy, son.

1603
01:43:48,369 --> 01:43:49,893
My son!

1604
01:43:54,441 --> 01:43:55,567
Satbir.

1605
01:43:56,744 --> 01:43:57,836
Ramesh.

1606
01:43:58,212 --> 01:44:00,237
Should we tell uncle Narendra?
-No friend.

1607
01:44:00,347 --> 01:44:01,609
lf we tell uncle Narendra..

1608
01:44:01,715 --> 01:44:03,205
..he will certainly try
to hunt down Kuku.

1609
01:44:03,350 --> 01:44:05,784
lf the lawyer has sent some
detective on him..

1610
01:44:06,253 --> 01:44:07,914
..the police will
follow him too.

1611
01:44:08,255 --> 01:44:10,314
According to me, we
shouldn't tell him.

1612
01:44:18,465 --> 01:44:19,523
Maahi.

1613
01:44:21,402 --> 01:44:22,494
Maahi!

1614
01:44:38,852 --> 01:44:41,252
My beloved!

1615
01:44:44,458 --> 01:44:46,688
My beloved!

1616
01:44:55,169 --> 01:44:56,864
Where are you going?
- l'll be back.

1617
01:44:57,338 --> 01:44:58,771
Close the door behind you.

1618
01:45:17,725 --> 01:45:19,920
Here. That'll be 64.50.

1619
01:45:20,661 --> 01:45:22,822
Sir, l..

1620
01:45:22,963 --> 01:45:25,295
lsn't this the same criminal?
We saw his photo on TV?

1621
01:45:25,399 --> 01:45:27,128
Yes! - Get him! Get him!

1622
01:45:27,434 --> 01:45:29,231
Catch him! Catch him!

1623
01:45:30,137 --> 01:45:31,866
Catch him!

1624
01:45:32,706 --> 01:45:35,675
This is that boy! He has
committed rape! Get him!

1625
01:45:44,818 --> 01:45:46,809
Why are you all running after
him? -He's a rapist.

1626
01:45:46,920 --> 01:45:48,148
Didn't you see it on TV?

1627
01:45:48,222 --> 01:45:50,213
Such a criminal shouldn't be
allowed to enter the locality.

1628
01:45:50,290 --> 01:45:52,758
Catch him! -Call the police.

1629
01:45:52,926 --> 01:45:54,518
The kidnapper is in our area.

1630
01:45:56,263 --> 01:45:57,753
Get him! He shouldn't escape.

1631
01:46:02,503 --> 01:46:04,767
Look. He looks innocent
from his face.

1632
01:46:04,872 --> 01:46:07,864
Don't go by his face, aunt. He
has taken away a minor girl.

1633
01:46:08,175 --> 01:46:09,267
Catch him!

1634
01:46:17,351 --> 01:46:18,943
Wait! Where will you escape too?

1635
01:46:19,219 --> 01:46:21,483
Catch him! Catch him!

1636
01:46:38,238 --> 01:46:40,206
Hit him. Hit the rascal
some more!

1637
01:46:40,307 --> 01:46:42,502
He ran away with an innocent
little girl. Hit him.

1638
01:46:42,843 --> 01:46:43,935
Hit some more!

1639
01:46:47,514 --> 01:46:49,778
Don't go too close. He
may strike suddenly.

1640
01:46:49,850 --> 01:46:51,647
These people are extremely
dangerous.

1641
01:46:51,752 --> 01:46:53,720
They keep knives and guns.

1642
01:46:54,221 --> 01:46:55,950
Come back. Stay away from him.

1643
01:46:56,723 --> 01:46:58,247
Come back.

1644
01:47:02,696 --> 01:47:04,459
Kuku, what happened? How did you
get this injury? -Maahi..

1645
01:47:04,565 --> 01:47:06,396
..it isn't safe for us
to stay here. Hurry!

1646
01:47:06,500 --> 01:47:07,558
Will you explain something?

1647
01:47:07,634 --> 01:47:09,363
We'll have to leave this
house right now. -Kuku.

1648
01:47:09,436 --> 01:47:11,404
Pack all essential
stuff quickly.

1649
01:47:13,574 --> 01:47:15,337
Sushma, l feel very tired.

1650
01:47:17,411 --> 01:47:19,845
Brother.. he just walked away.

1651
01:47:21,315 --> 01:47:22,543
Brother. - Yes.

1652
01:47:22,683 --> 01:47:25,243
Where is Suraj Cottage?

1653
01:47:25,486 --> 01:47:27,886
Go there, turn left
and climb the hill.

1654
01:47:28,222 --> 01:47:29,587
Ok. Thanks.

1655
01:47:29,857 --> 01:47:31,688
We'll have to go
high. - Come on.

1656
01:47:32,526 --> 01:47:34,255
Come on quickly, Maahi.

1657
01:47:37,564 --> 01:47:39,828
There he is. - There! - Get him!

1658
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:42,191
Catch him! Don't let him escape.

1659
01:47:51,845 --> 01:47:53,210
Hurry Maahi!

1660
01:47:53,714 --> 01:47:55,204
Open this.

1661
01:47:58,418 --> 01:47:59,942
Come on, Maahi. Come carefully.

1662
01:48:03,957 --> 01:48:05,254
Get them.

1663
01:48:20,541 --> 01:48:21,667
What now?

1664
01:48:21,875 --> 01:48:24,435
We'll catch the first bus in the
morning and leave this place.

1665
01:48:24,645 --> 01:48:27,170
We'll leave this locality.
Come on. - Where?

1666
01:48:28,815 --> 01:48:32,376
We cannot stay here all
night or go back home.

1667
01:48:33,787 --> 01:48:34,879
Come on.

1668
01:48:35,822 --> 01:48:37,687
lshrat Khan. Surajmukhi cottage.

1669
01:48:37,824 --> 01:48:39,519
Black dock, Talauzi.

1670
01:48:45,599 --> 01:48:46,759
Sushma. - Yes?

1671
01:48:46,867 --> 01:48:48,494
The entire house has
been ransacked.

1672
01:48:48,569 --> 01:48:49,934
We have come at the right
address, right?

1673
01:48:50,203 --> 01:48:53,195
We have come to the address
the boys gave us. - Yes.

1674
01:48:53,273 --> 01:48:55,207
Let's look for a light
switch. -Yes.

1675
01:49:07,754 --> 01:49:08,982
Where is Kuku?

1676
01:49:10,257 --> 01:49:11,519
Where is Maahi?

1677
01:49:11,892 --> 01:49:12,984
Kuku!

1678
01:49:13,594 --> 01:49:14,652
Maahi!

1679
01:49:19,766 --> 01:49:20,824
Hello.

1680
01:49:22,336 --> 01:49:23,360
Hello!

1681
01:49:23,837 --> 01:49:24,895
Papa.

1682
01:49:29,710 --> 01:49:31,735
Maahi! Where are you, dear?

1683
01:49:32,913 --> 01:49:35,438
Maahi, your mother is very
worried.. -Give me the phone.

1684
01:49:36,516 --> 01:49:39,314
Maahi. Come back, child.

1685
01:49:41,188 --> 01:49:43,315
Don't punish your mother
in such a way.

1686
01:49:44,725 --> 01:49:47,353
We keep talking about
you all the time.

1687
01:49:49,730 --> 01:49:50,856
Your father doesn't sleep
in the nights.

1688
01:49:50,931 --> 01:49:52,660
He sits near the phone, child.

1689
01:49:53,934 --> 01:49:56,698
Mother, please give
the phone to papa.

1690
01:49:57,304 --> 01:49:58,566
l want to talk to him.

1691
01:49:59,740 --> 01:50:01,367
She wants to talk to you.

1692
01:50:03,377 --> 01:50:04,469
Tell me, Maahi.

1693
01:50:04,611 --> 01:50:06,841
l read in a magazine that
Kuku is a rapist..

1694
01:50:07,280 --> 01:50:09,305
..and you will have him
punished strictly.

1695
01:50:09,483 --> 01:50:11,781
No, Maahi. lt was.. - Papa,
Kuku isn't a rapist.

1696
01:50:12,219 --> 01:50:14,915
l instigated it. l'm more
at fault than he is.

1697
01:50:15,555 --> 01:50:18,524
Have a case against me
and have me punished.

1698
01:50:18,625 --> 01:50:19,717
What did she say. -Maahi!

1699
01:50:19,826 --> 01:50:22,522
How come the case is always
against a male?

1700
01:50:22,829 --> 01:50:25,627
He is the culprit and a girl
is a helpless victim.

1701
01:50:26,433 --> 01:50:29,300
l refuse to accept it, papa.
l am not a victim.

1702
01:50:29,536 --> 01:50:31,561
Maahi, it's a crime.
You are a minor.

1703
01:50:31,738 --> 01:50:34,229
You would get me married
to some billionaire.

1704
01:50:34,408 --> 01:50:36,205
l would rule that
place for life.

1705
01:50:36,476 --> 01:50:39,411
Wouldn't l have been a minor
then? -Maahi, listen to me.

1706
01:50:39,513 --> 01:50:42,641
You listen to me, papa and
don't interrupt me now.

1707
01:50:43,884 --> 01:50:46,944
We are not children nor are
we ignorant and stupid.

1708
01:50:47,621 --> 01:50:50,818
Fate made us meet, nature
put us together.

1709
01:50:51,425 --> 01:50:53,393
How is it entirely
our fault then?

1710
01:50:55,295 --> 01:50:58,287
l know that l shouldn't
have become pregnant..

1711
01:50:58,765 --> 01:51:03,896
..but if l did which is by
nature, what is to be done now?

1712
01:51:04,604 --> 01:51:08,540
Papa, if a girl becomes pregnant
what should she do?

1713
01:51:08,709 --> 01:51:09,835
Abortion?

1714
01:51:10,677 --> 01:51:13,271
lf it isn't a crime
to kill an unborn..

1715
01:51:13,380 --> 01:51:16,213
..why is it illegal
in many countries?

1716
01:51:16,516 --> 01:51:20,475
lf an infant is smothered and
killed and thrown into..

1717
01:51:20,987 --> 01:51:23,353
..a rubbish pile won't that
be a sin or a crime?

1718
01:51:23,724 --> 01:51:26,318
lf the unborn isn't killed
and nurture it..

1719
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:28,687
..the world will make it
difficult for us to live.

1720
01:51:28,895 --> 01:51:31,295
What way does a girl have then?

1721
01:51:31,565 --> 01:51:34,830
She can only hang
herself and die.

1722
01:51:39,306 --> 01:51:41,536
l'm being very insolent,
right papa?

1723
01:51:44,945 --> 01:51:46,913
You think it over papa.

1724
01:51:47,447 --> 01:51:50,416
Who has more right to decide
the age to fall in love?

1725
01:51:50,717 --> 01:51:52,480
You or nature?

1726
01:51:54,321 --> 01:51:56,755
You cannot change
laws of nature.

1727
01:51:57,424 --> 01:51:59,915
Why don't you think about
your law then?

1728
01:52:03,196 --> 01:52:04,754
l'm sorry papa!

1729
01:52:14,775 --> 01:52:15,969
Maahi please.

1730
01:52:16,843 --> 01:52:18,777
No. lt's alright.

1731
01:52:19,412 --> 01:52:20,470
l'm alright.

1732
01:52:41,935 --> 01:52:44,529
The night is still remaining.
Go to sleep.

1733
01:52:45,505 --> 01:52:47,735
No bus will leave from
here before morning.

1734
01:52:59,219 --> 01:53:00,743
We are almost there, Maahi.

1735
01:53:01,288 --> 01:53:03,552
Chandigarh-Delhi.
Chandigarh-Delhi.

1736
01:53:03,757 --> 01:53:05,622
Come on. Chandigarh-Delhi.
Quickly.

1737
01:53:05,759 --> 01:53:06,885
Chandigarh-Delhi.

1738
01:53:07,627 --> 01:53:09,686
This bus will go to Delhi,
right? - Yes, it will.

1739
01:53:09,896 --> 01:53:11,193
Come on. Let's sit.

1740
01:53:11,264 --> 01:53:12,356
Go. Sit quickly.

1741
01:53:13,667 --> 01:53:16,431
Sushma. Kuku! - Kuku!

1742
01:53:18,371 --> 01:53:19,565
Maahi, come on. Run!

1743
01:53:19,706 --> 01:53:22,539
Wait! Stop! -No! - Wait Kuku!

1744
01:53:23,210 --> 01:53:25,770
Kuku, l asked you to
stop. - Be careful.

1745
01:53:26,146 --> 01:53:27,909
Stop you worthless boy!

1746
01:53:28,248 --> 01:53:29,806
You are making us
run in a jungle.

1747
01:53:30,150 --> 01:53:31,674
Have you gone crazy? - Kuku.

1748
01:53:31,852 --> 01:53:34,719
Wait there l said! - Wait!

1749
01:53:36,489 --> 01:53:38,753
Be careful! You have a
child in your belly!

1750
01:53:39,226 --> 01:53:41,285
Come on, Maahi. - Wait you fool!

1751
01:53:41,695 --> 01:53:44,664
l can't run after you.
You know that.

1752
01:53:46,900 --> 01:53:50,597
What are you doing? Why are
you doing this with us?

1753
01:53:53,373 --> 01:53:56,433
l am illiterate and uncultured.

1754
01:53:57,310 --> 01:53:59,244
l couldn't do anything in life.

1755
01:54:00,213 --> 01:54:03,444
We wanted to educate you
and make you a good man.

1756
01:54:04,784 --> 01:54:08,652
You instead ruined all
our aspirations.

1757
01:54:12,759 --> 01:54:14,750
Your mother has gone mad crying!

1758
01:54:14,928 --> 01:54:16,623
Her fate is against her.

1759
01:54:16,796 --> 01:54:20,698
She got you as a son
and me as a husband.

1760
01:54:21,334 --> 01:54:23,802
l never gave her any
happiness in life.

1761
01:54:24,871 --> 01:54:27,169
l have only given her
sorrow and trouble.

1762
01:54:28,174 --> 01:54:31,610
Now you too are going to do the
same with this innocent girl.

1763
01:54:33,346 --> 01:54:35,337
You have ruined her destiny.

1764
01:54:38,585 --> 01:54:40,314
No uncle. Please don't cry.

1765
01:54:43,456 --> 01:54:46,857
Kuku didn't give me sorrow
or any hardship.

1766
01:54:47,594 --> 01:54:49,653
ln fact, he took
good care of me.

1767
01:55:01,541 --> 01:55:02,633
Mummy!

1768
01:55:06,479 --> 01:55:07,741
l'm sorry aunt.

1769
01:55:17,290 --> 01:55:20,384
Dad. l'm sorry daddy.

1770
01:55:24,698 --> 01:55:25,790
l love you.

1771
01:55:29,536 --> 01:55:31,128
Don't l love you?

1772
01:55:32,672 --> 01:55:33,764
Don't l?

1773
01:55:35,375 --> 01:55:37,536
You donkey! ldiot!

1774
01:55:38,545 --> 01:55:40,137
Fool! Nutter!

1775
01:55:42,749 --> 01:55:43,875
l'm sorry daddy.

1776
01:56:01,201 --> 01:56:03,396
Aunt, what's happening to me?

1777
01:56:07,207 --> 01:56:09,573
Oh! Your uterus has burst.

1778
01:56:10,477 --> 01:56:13,469
Listen! The child is coming.

1779
01:56:13,847 --> 01:56:16,179
What? On the bus? - Yes!

1780
01:56:16,249 --> 01:56:18,444
We'll have to take her to a
hospital. - Stop the bus then.

1781
01:56:18,718 --> 01:56:20,515
Stop it. - Stop the bus!

1782
01:56:20,887 --> 01:56:23,185
Did you call Maahi's parents?

1783
01:56:23,289 --> 01:56:24,813
l have called them, Sushma.

1784
01:56:33,566 --> 01:56:36,660
Be careful, brother. -Wait.
Kabir Punjabi? -Yes.

1785
01:56:37,404 --> 01:56:41,204
For raping and abducting a
minor, you are under arrest.

1786
01:56:41,474 --> 01:56:43,305
Daddy. - Oh no!

1787
01:56:43,676 --> 01:56:46,270
Mother, please don't do this!
- Don't worry about him now.

1788
01:56:46,346 --> 01:56:47,438
Oh my god!

1789
01:56:47,547 --> 01:56:49,742
Mummy, go now and
look after Maahi.

1790
01:56:49,816 --> 01:56:51,511
Mummy, please don't
do that. - Maahi!

1791
01:56:51,584 --> 01:56:54,644
Mummy, please don't
do it! - Maahi.

1792
01:56:54,721 --> 01:56:56,211
Kuku! Kuku!

1793
01:56:59,359 --> 01:57:01,554
Congratulations. She
has had a boy.

1794
01:57:01,728 --> 01:57:03,320
That's great.

1795
01:57:03,797 --> 01:57:04,991
There is no need to worry.

1796
01:57:05,231 --> 01:57:07,426
Your daughter too is fine,
Mr. and Mrs. Puri.

1797
01:57:19,345 --> 01:57:20,573
What are you doing?

1798
01:57:42,268 --> 01:57:43,394
My lord, there is a proverb
that goes..

1799
01:57:43,470 --> 01:57:45,233
'Some show their colours
at a young age.'

1800
01:57:45,405 --> 01:57:49,501
lt fits the accused Kabir or
Kuku Punjabi perfectly.

1801
01:57:50,243 --> 01:57:53,804
He studies in a school but has
already started doing all this.

1802
01:57:55,248 --> 01:57:58,513
First he trapped a minor
in his love game.

1803
01:57:58,751 --> 01:58:00,946
He gave her alcohol to
drink and raped her.

1804
01:58:01,354 --> 01:58:02,753
When he found out that
she is pregnant..

1805
01:58:02,856 --> 01:58:06,485
..without caring about her
health, he tried an abortion.

1806
01:58:07,460 --> 01:58:08,757
When that didn't work..

1807
01:58:08,862 --> 01:58:11,660
..he showed her wonderful dreams
and eloped with her.

1808
01:58:12,465 --> 01:58:14,399
He kept her in some
hilly village.

1809
01:58:14,467 --> 01:58:16,833
There was no one to
stop his doings.

1810
01:58:17,737 --> 01:58:20,831
This boy ruined that
girl's life.

1811
01:58:21,541 --> 01:58:25,272
At this young age, that girl
has become a mother, My lord.

1812
01:58:26,546 --> 01:58:28,514
This boy took away
her adolescence.

1813
01:58:28,848 --> 01:58:33,251
Mr. Agarwal, just narrate
the facts please.

1814
01:58:33,586 --> 01:58:36,419
The only fact is, My lord,
that the accused Kabir..

1815
01:58:36,890 --> 01:58:38,858
..is a rapist and a kidnapper.

1816
01:58:39,259 --> 01:58:41,659
He doesn't care about
the world or the law.

1817
01:58:42,395 --> 01:58:45,193
The court shouldn't have mercy
on him as he is young.

1818
01:58:45,565 --> 01:58:48,398
lnstead he should be given
harsh punishment.

1819
01:58:49,369 --> 01:58:52,566
Who is the defence lawyer?
- lt's me, My lord.

1820
01:58:53,406 --> 01:58:56,807
Mr. Rastogi, the defence
will be heard tomorrow.

1821
01:58:56,976 --> 01:58:58,944
Till then, the court
is adjourned.

1822
01:59:03,783 --> 01:59:04,841
Sir.

1823
01:59:09,756 --> 01:59:13,920
Tell me. -My son has been
accused of rape.

1824
01:59:14,861 --> 01:59:18,228
l want you to plead his
case on his behalf.

1825
01:59:22,235 --> 01:59:23,361
Why would l plead your case?

1826
01:59:23,503 --> 01:59:26,199
You are such a famous
criminal lawyer.

1827
01:59:26,573 --> 01:59:27,904
Thieves, dacoits, murderers
and gangsters..

1828
01:59:28,174 --> 01:59:31,871
Whoever comes to you, you
fight on their behalf.

1829
01:59:32,478 --> 01:59:35,641
But yes, you charge high
fees. l know that.

1830
01:59:35,815 --> 01:59:37,806
That is why this..

1831
01:59:42,722 --> 01:59:46,556
My entire life's savings..
l'm keeping it before you.

1832
01:59:47,360 --> 01:59:51,387
Even if that is less, l'll sell
my rickshaws and my house.

1833
01:59:51,464 --> 01:59:53,864
l will pay your entire
fee amount.

1834
01:59:56,269 --> 01:59:57,429
l'm leaving.

1835
01:59:58,771 --> 02:00:00,739
Brother, didn't you think

1836
02:00:00,840 --> 02:00:02,808
that he could make you
lose your case.

1837
02:00:04,577 --> 02:00:07,569
No sister. Mr. Puri
is a good lawyer.

1838
02:00:08,214 --> 02:00:10,705
Now we have to see how good
he is a human being.

1839
02:00:27,634 --> 02:00:28,726
Okay.

1840
02:00:29,335 --> 02:00:31,667
Mr. Rastogi. - My lord.

1841
02:00:43,182 --> 02:00:45,480
Mr. Agarwal. - Yes My lord.

1842
02:00:51,224 --> 02:00:55,183
Sir.

1843
02:00:56,462 --> 02:00:58,362
This is strange. - Yes it is.

1844
02:01:00,600 --> 02:01:02,192
Maahi hasn't come yet.

1845
02:01:02,535 --> 02:01:04,469
The doctor has permitted
her to come, right?

1846
02:01:04,570 --> 02:01:06,629
Robin has gone to get her
from the hospital.

1847
02:01:06,839 --> 02:01:09,865
l want to see how Mr. Puri
can change this case.

1848
02:01:10,209 --> 02:01:11,540
Thank you. - Ok My lord.

1849
02:01:12,712 --> 02:01:14,543
Mr. Puri, you may proceed.

1850
02:01:15,615 --> 02:01:17,242
Thank you, your honour.

1851
02:01:24,924 --> 02:01:27,518
Accused Kabir Punjabi has
been charged with rape.

1852
02:01:28,828 --> 02:01:31,160
A rape can be defined
clearly, your honour.

1853
02:01:31,264 --> 02:01:35,792
Physical relations with a
girl who refuses sex..

1854
02:01:37,170 --> 02:01:39,570
..or a girl who isn't
of age to agree.

1855
02:01:40,239 --> 02:01:42,207
lt means that she is a minor.

1856
02:01:43,676 --> 02:01:46,645
At what age does a girl become
able to consent, your honour..

1857
02:01:46,913 --> 02:01:49,905
There are different laws in
different countries for this.

1858
02:01:50,216 --> 02:01:54,744
ln Canada, this age is 14 years,
15 in France and 12 in Mexico.

1859
02:01:55,221 --> 02:01:59,658
ln most areas of UK, the US and
in lndia it is said to be 16.

1860
02:01:59,892 --> 02:02:02,258
ln most areas, your honour,
not everywhere.

1861
02:02:02,762 --> 02:02:04,957
ln our country, in the
state of Manipur..

1862
02:02:05,531 --> 02:02:08,523
..instead of 16, a 14 year old
girl can consent to have sex.

1863
02:02:09,202 --> 02:02:12,296
ln fact, if she is married,
the girl can even be 13.

1864
02:02:12,438 --> 02:02:14,372
This wouldn't be considered
as rape.

1865
02:02:24,317 --> 02:02:27,514
So, at what age does a
girl become matured..

1866
02:02:28,187 --> 02:02:29,848
..and old enough
is the question.

1867
02:02:30,156 --> 02:02:32,624
Someone had given me fair
opinion on this.

1868
02:02:34,160 --> 02:02:35,354
Just think..

1869
02:02:35,628 --> 02:02:39,758
Who has more right to decide
the age to fall in love?

1870
02:02:40,333 --> 02:02:42,460
You or nature?

1871
02:02:43,703 --> 02:02:45,830
You cannot change
laws of nature.

1872
02:02:46,205 --> 02:02:48,332
Why don't you think about
your law then?

1873
02:02:55,481 --> 02:02:58,245
Anyway, your honour. To come
back to the present case.

1874
02:02:59,185 --> 02:03:00,812
When Maahi Puri met
Kuku Punjabi..

1875
02:03:00,953 --> 02:03:03,183
..she was 16 years old.

1876
02:03:03,556 --> 02:03:06,184
She formed this relation
of her own accord.

1877
02:03:06,559 --> 02:03:10,859
So, your honour, this case isn't
of rape or of being a minor.

1878
02:03:11,764 --> 02:03:15,632
That is why l want to take
back my case now.

1879
02:03:20,206 --> 02:03:22,674
Bravo! Love wins! Love
wins! Love wins! -Sit!

1880
02:03:22,842 --> 02:03:23,900
Order! Order!

1881
02:03:25,178 --> 02:03:26,770
lf you wanted to take
back the case..

1882
02:03:26,846 --> 02:03:29,371
..why did you need to waste
the court's time?

1883
02:03:30,149 --> 02:03:31,582
You could have done
it without hassle.

1884
02:03:31,751 --> 02:03:33,844
lf l would have done
that quietly..

1885
02:03:35,288 --> 02:03:37,722
..how would l have given a
message to numerous people?

1886
02:03:38,458 --> 02:03:41,552
They misunderstand children to
be their property like l did.

1887
02:03:45,331 --> 02:03:46,457
Your honour..

1888
02:03:47,366 --> 02:03:49,459
..when children don't get
love from their parents..

1889
02:03:50,236 --> 02:03:51,328
..they don't get affection..

1890
02:03:51,437 --> 02:03:53,564
..when their house becomes like
a prison cell for them..

1891
02:03:54,173 --> 02:03:56,505
..they leave the house
and do such a thing.

1892
02:03:56,909 --> 02:03:58,308
Sex is one of them.

1893
02:04:00,179 --> 02:04:02,443
ln our daughter's life
the emptiness..

1894
02:04:02,548 --> 02:04:05,381
..and emotional vacuum that we
created in our daughter's life..

1895
02:04:06,285 --> 02:04:11,188
For filling that she did this
and didn't think of the result.

1896
02:04:15,828 --> 02:04:18,490
Accused Kabir Punjabi has made
a mistake, your honour.

1897
02:04:19,365 --> 02:04:20,559
He hasn't sinned.

1898
02:04:20,766 --> 02:04:23,394
We will have to differentiate
between mistake and crime.

1899
02:04:23,669 --> 02:04:26,137
We agree that Kabir Punjabi
is childish..

1900
02:04:26,672 --> 02:04:28,663
..but l would like
to praise him too.

1901
02:04:28,841 --> 02:04:31,708
ln the last few months, he has
fulfilled his responsibilities..

1902
02:04:31,811 --> 02:04:33,335
..entirely as an adult.

1903
02:04:33,913 --> 02:04:36,507
He hasn't fled from his
responsibilities, your honour.

1904
02:04:36,649 --> 02:04:38,514
He took complete care of Maahi.

1905
02:04:38,851 --> 02:04:42,343
ln fact, he truly loves Maahi.

1906
02:04:44,457 --> 02:04:46,789
The love that my daughter
received from Kabir..

1907
02:04:47,927 --> 02:04:51,488
..maybe l couldn't give her
that through her life.

1908
02:04:55,568 --> 02:05:00,198
Your honour, if someone is
guilty in this case, it's me.

1909
02:05:02,441 --> 02:05:04,909
These children came to me
with their petition.

1910
02:05:05,378 --> 02:05:07,312
They asked for help
and a way out.

1911
02:05:08,614 --> 02:05:12,641
Due to my stubbornness, l pushed
them into such trouble.

1912
02:05:13,686 --> 02:05:16,678
lf they would go through some
accident through this..

1913
02:05:18,190 --> 02:05:21,557
..if there would be a
misfortune, who would be guilty?

1914
02:05:22,662 --> 02:05:24,562
Who would be in the witness-box,
your honour?

1915
02:05:24,697 --> 02:05:26,494
Against whom would
a case be filed?

1916
02:05:35,474 --> 02:05:37,533
Your honour, l realise that..

1917
02:05:39,178 --> 02:05:43,478
..as l made a complaint and
took it back myself..

1918
02:05:44,717 --> 02:05:47,277
..l may have to give
up my law license.

1919
02:05:48,187 --> 02:05:50,485
Still, l felt that today
in the courtroom..

1920
02:05:51,390 --> 02:05:54,450
..it would be better if l spoke
like a father than of a lawyer.

1921
02:05:56,696 --> 02:06:00,655
l request you to strike down
this case. That's all.

1922
02:06:03,436 --> 02:06:06,269
l refuse your request.

1923
02:06:11,510 --> 02:06:13,569
This is a court-case, Mr. Puri.

1924
02:06:14,347 --> 02:06:16,178
lt is not your household
problem.

1925
02:06:16,415 --> 02:06:19,543
lt won't be over if you forgive
your daughter and son-in-law.

1926
02:06:20,786 --> 02:06:24,654
l want to ask Kabir Punjabi
and Maahi Puri..

1927
02:06:25,424 --> 02:06:28,393
..what they mean by this
irresponsible act?

1928
02:06:28,594 --> 02:06:31,256
There are slogans shouted
in court. Love wins!

1929
02:06:31,430 --> 02:06:32,692
Love has won!

1930
02:06:33,432 --> 02:06:35,593
l want to ask you what kind
of victory this is.

1931
02:06:36,602 --> 02:06:39,662
You gave up your education,
your house..

1932
02:06:40,473 --> 02:06:44,500
..your parents, friends,
relatives, the society..

1933
02:06:44,944 --> 02:06:46,571
..and all kinds of support.

1934
02:06:46,679 --> 02:06:49,842
You wouldn't have a stable
future or a career.

1935
02:06:50,783 --> 02:06:53,547
A hero-heroine pair is eloping
and living together.

1936
02:06:54,487 --> 02:06:55,545
Have they won?

1937
02:06:56,255 --> 02:06:59,224
What about the child
in your arms?

1938
02:07:00,226 --> 02:07:04,219
lf you can't be something what
will you do with the child?

1939
02:07:04,930 --> 02:07:08,388
Along-with yours, this child's
future too is in darkness.

1940
02:07:09,001 --> 02:07:10,525
ls this a small loss?

1941
02:07:10,970 --> 02:07:16,772
Maahi Puri, l cannot punish
you as the child with you..

1942
02:07:17,543 --> 02:07:19,340
..is completely dependent
on you.

1943
02:07:19,545 --> 02:07:23,276
That is why l advise you to
complete your education.

1944
02:07:26,552 --> 02:07:31,387
Kabir Punjabi, l punish you to a
remand home for three months.

1945
02:07:34,193 --> 02:07:35,558
ln three months, you
have to think..

1946
02:07:35,628 --> 02:07:38,688
..where you want to
take your life.

1947
02:07:39,331 --> 02:07:44,200
How do you want your relation
with Maahi to last forever?

1948
02:07:44,904 --> 02:07:48,567
The day you live your life
with your family..

1949
02:07:48,841 --> 02:07:51,207
..in a respectable and
successful life..

1950
02:07:51,677 --> 02:07:53,736
..only on that day will
your love win.

1951
02:07:54,413 --> 02:07:56,506
This court is adjourned.

1952
02:07:59,752 --> 02:08:03,552
You told me one day to tell
you if l was in love.

1953
02:08:03,823 --> 02:08:06,223
Have you started loving
me? -Yes Maahi.

1954
02:08:07,226 --> 02:08:08,591
l love you a lot.

1955
02:08:12,331 --> 02:08:14,595
l love you a lot too, Kuku.

1956
02:08:17,536 --> 02:08:18,730
l love you Maahi.

1957
02:08:21,340 --> 02:08:23,001
Sushma, what is he doing?

1958
02:08:32,518 --> 02:08:37,455
Let me bow down to you.
Wait for a moment.

1959
02:08:38,491 --> 02:08:43,554
Become a feeling and enter me.

1960
02:08:44,230 --> 02:08:49,258
Let me bow down to you.
Wait for a moment.

1961
02:08:50,236 --> 02:08:54,900
Become a feeling and enter me.

1962
02:08:55,274 --> 02:08:57,936
She is my dream,
she is my love.

1963
02:08:58,244 --> 02:09:00,906
She is my body and my soul.

1964
02:09:01,213 --> 02:09:03,807
Without her, the
earth is lonely.

1965
02:09:03,883 --> 02:09:06,579
l find the heavens lonely.

1966
02:09:06,786 --> 02:09:12,884
My God, let me meet my love.

1967
02:09:13,492 --> 02:09:19,226
My God, let me meet my love.

1968
02:09:19,365 --> 02:09:24,564
My God, let me meet my love.

1969
02:09:25,171 --> 02:09:29,938
My God, let me meet my love.

1970
02:09:30,276 --> 02:09:31,402
My God!

1971
02:09:36,749 --> 02:09:41,743
The sight is painful. Don't
deprive me like this.

1972
02:09:42,588 --> 02:09:47,855
Turn into realisation of
my thoughts for me.

1973
02:09:48,460 --> 02:09:53,557
The sight is painful. Don't
deprive me like this.

1974
02:09:54,300 --> 02:09:59,237
Turn into realisation of
my thoughts for me.

1975
02:09:59,438 --> 02:10:02,271
She is my dream,
she is my love.

1976
02:10:02,374 --> 02:10:05,207
She is my body and my soul.

1977
02:10:05,344 --> 02:10:07,972
Without her, the
earth is lonely.

1978
02:10:08,247 --> 02:10:10,841
l find the heavens lonely.

1979
02:10:11,217 --> 02:10:17,281
My God, let me meet my love.

1980
02:10:17,656 --> 02:10:22,457
My God, let me meet my love.

1981
02:10:22,761 --> 02:10:23,819
My God!

1982
02:10:46,919 --> 02:10:52,482
l live in pain and suffer
due to the distance.

1983
02:10:52,758 --> 02:10:57,491
l ask my emotions
not to harass me.

1984
02:10:58,697 --> 02:11:04,226
Within my heart
and in my life.

1985
02:11:04,503 --> 02:11:07,836
Only she exists everywhere.

1986
02:11:10,209 --> 02:11:12,541
My God, let me meet..

1987
02:11:15,948 --> 02:11:20,976
My God, let me meet my love.

1988
02:11:21,787 --> 02:11:26,383
My God, let me meet my love.

1989
02:11:26,792 --> 02:11:29,625
She is my dream,
she is my love.

1990
02:11:29,762 --> 02:11:32,595
She is my body and my soul.

1991
02:11:32,698 --> 02:11:35,496
Without her, the
earth is lonely.

1992
02:11:35,601 --> 02:11:38,434
l find the heavens lonely.

1993
02:11:38,604 --> 02:11:44,600
My God, let me meet my love.

1994
02:11:45,177 --> 02:11:50,615
My God, let me meet my love.

1995
02:11:50,816 --> 02:11:56,413
My God, let me meet my love.

1996
02:11:56,722 --> 02:12:01,625
My God, let me meet my love.

1997
02:12:01,827 --> 02:12:02,885
My God!
