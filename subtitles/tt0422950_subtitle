1
00:02:46,546 --> 00:02:50,209
I've always felt an affinity
with the blue skies...

2
00:02:50,283 --> 00:02:52,376
...behind those dark clouds

3
00:02:54,287 --> 00:03:00,226
There's just a few moments of
Hide-n-seek with the thick clouds...

4
00:03:00,293 --> 00:03:04,730
...before the skies come
into their own again.

5
00:03:11,905 --> 00:03:14,396
No!

6
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:23,743
Tamy, this is not fair.

7
00:03:23,817 --> 00:03:25,751
I haven't read all of it yet
- I got to leave!

8
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:27,753
So what? I got to leave too!

9
00:03:34,327 --> 00:03:36,261
Tamy, you are so mean.

10
00:03:40,934 --> 00:03:44,267
Oh God! Oh my God.

11
00:03:44,771 --> 00:03:46,261
You've been glued to the newspaper
since this morning...

12
00:03:46,339 --> 00:03:48,273
...and didn't even tell me!

13
00:03:48,341 --> 00:03:51,777
Surprise, surprise!
- What surprise? Late surprise!

14
00:03:51,845 --> 00:03:52,937
Late surprise!

15
00:03:53,013 --> 00:03:56,608
I had heard of late reactions. Late
surprise's a new one on me!

16
00:03:56,683 --> 00:04:00,949
You've heard it now, okay?
- Tanu!

17
00:04:01,021 --> 00:04:03,615
Don't cut it out!
I've yet to read it.

18
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,624
I'm cutting it already.

19
00:04:22,642 --> 00:04:28,308
Why does Dj associates win
this award every year?

20
00:04:28,381 --> 00:04:31,316
Because we are the best.
Let's hear it for us.

21
00:04:31,384 --> 00:04:35,320
Yeah! And all thanks to one person.

22
00:04:35,388 --> 00:04:38,323
Please put your hands
together for Tamanna.

23
00:04:38,391 --> 00:04:39,824
C'mon. C'mon.
- Thank you.

24
00:04:39,893 --> 00:04:41,326
Also thanks to another person.

25
00:04:41,394 --> 00:04:44,329
Please put your hands
together for yours truly.

26
00:05:05,685 --> 00:05:08,347
Sir, dinner?

27
00:05:12,392 --> 00:05:14,690
I waited so long for this.

28
00:05:15,028 --> 00:05:17,360
I just don't want this night to end.

29
00:05:24,704 --> 00:05:28,367
Thanks, Tam. For standing by me...

30
00:05:28,441 --> 00:05:36,371
...when I started this small company.
And for being with me ever since.

31
00:05:38,451 --> 00:05:40,385
Thanks for this award.

32
00:05:43,456 --> 00:05:45,390
Thanks for your guidance.

33
00:05:46,726 --> 00:05:48,387
Shall we eat?

34
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:54,729
I'm not at all hungry!
- But it's Chinese. Your favorite.

35
00:05:54,801 --> 00:05:56,735
And it's supposed to be very good.

36
00:05:56,803 --> 00:05:58,737
Ok. All right.

37
00:05:59,739 --> 00:06:01,400
Let's go.

38
00:06:02,475 --> 00:06:05,410
What happened?
- I'm getting old. What else?

39
00:06:06,746 --> 00:06:08,907
Tell me something new!

40
00:06:12,485 --> 00:06:15,750
Lalit, whom do you want
to dedicate this song to?

41
00:06:15,822 --> 00:06:17,414
To my wife Nalini.

42
00:06:19,826 --> 00:06:22,556
Tania, actually Nalini and
I had a fight this morning

43
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:25,427
I promised to take her out to the
movies and myself forgot to be there

44
00:06:28,168 --> 00:06:32,229
I want to dedicate this song to
her and say I'm sorry to her.

45
00:06:34,107 --> 00:06:36,837
Look at him, Nalini. Lalit
really loves you

46
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:42,447
Please forgive him. And here's a
special song for the two of you.

47
00:06:44,117 --> 00:06:48,554
Have a great night everyone.

48
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:53,452
This call is being forwarded to...

49
00:07:01,534 --> 00:07:05,095
There's the train, parked right
on top of the crematorium.

50
00:07:05,805 --> 00:07:07,466
And just then...

51
00:07:13,546 --> 00:07:17,482
...the door of the compartment
creaks open on its own.

52
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:21,480
It's just the bell!

53
00:07:21,988 --> 00:07:24,980
Jerk, it's your own story.
And you're running scared?

54
00:07:26,826 --> 00:07:29,488
Let's give her a surprise.
- Quiet!

55
00:07:29,562 --> 00:07:31,154
Tanu, haven't you gone to sleep?
- If you had the key...

56
00:07:31,231 --> 00:07:32,994
Congratulations!

57
00:07:36,836 --> 00:07:40,829
Why is it so dark? No electricity?
- Sam was telling us a horror story.

58
00:07:40,907 --> 00:07:43,501
Sam! Grow up!
- Hey, I was simply...

59
00:07:43,576 --> 00:07:45,168
You're the limit, Tania.

60
00:07:45,245 --> 00:07:47,839
You start squealing the moment
Big Sister arrives.

61
00:07:47,914 --> 00:07:50,849
So when's the party?
- The party's already over.

62
00:07:50,917 --> 00:07:54,182
And my tummy's full too.
- No way! No excuses this time!

63
00:07:54,254 --> 00:07:57,018
You guys are acting as if something
great has happened.

64
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:01,527
Maybe it wouldn't be so great for
us if we won awards every day too.

65
00:08:01,594 --> 00:08:04,529
Party! Party!

66
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:08,533
Ok, guys. Here's the deal.

67
00:08:08,601 --> 00:08:10,535
The day my photo appears on the
Cover-page of Business Today...

68
00:08:10,603 --> 00:08:13,538
I'll give you all a party. Okay?
- Cheapo!

69
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:18,200
Hey Surjit, what're you thinking of?
- Just a moment.

70
00:08:22,048 --> 00:08:23,538
Very talented, man!

71
00:08:26,886 --> 00:08:29,047
Stinking caricature!

72
00:08:29,122 --> 00:08:31,556
Sam, be a sport.
- He's a sport.

73
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,058
No wonder people keep
playing with him.

74
00:08:34,127 --> 00:08:35,890
Sure, do play with me all the time.

75
00:08:35,962 --> 00:08:39,728
But what's happening in your
own life, Miss Rossane?

76
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,061
What? What?

77
00:08:41,134 --> 00:08:43,227
Rossane's an usher at
Symphony from today.

78
00:08:43,303 --> 00:08:45,567
Ooh! Wow!

79
00:08:45,638 --> 00:08:47,196
Free movies? - I don't know
how long I'll be there.

80
00:08:47,273 --> 00:08:48,570
Not again, Rossane!

81
00:08:49,909 --> 00:08:51,570
Stick to at least some job!

82
00:08:51,644 --> 00:08:54,078
She's bored of the job
even before joining it!

83
00:08:54,147 --> 00:08:55,580
Right.

84
00:08:55,648 --> 00:08:56,910
No phone calls.

85
00:08:56,983 --> 00:09:00,578
But it's Niharika.
- Hi, Tamanna! Got my message?

86
00:09:00,653 --> 00:09:03,588
Sure, I even called back.
- So you're coming, aren't you?

87
00:09:03,656 --> 00:09:07,592
No, I don't think I'll be able to
make it. Got loads of work to do.

88
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,595
Suit yourself. Anyway,
Rohit is coming.

89
00:09:10,663 --> 00:09:12,597
What?

90
00:09:13,933 --> 00:09:15,594
Excuse me.

91
00:09:17,937 --> 00:09:21,930
What did you say...?
- Rohit is coming.

92
00:09:22,008 --> 00:09:26,604
Rohit...? Rohit Manchanda?
- Yup.

93
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,615
I'll kill you, if it turns
out to be a lie.

94
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:33,077
So you're coming, right?

95
00:09:33,152 --> 00:09:35,620
Tamanna, what's happening?

96
00:09:36,956 --> 00:09:39,948
After all these years! Are you sure...?

97
00:09:40,026 --> 00:09:41,618
Yes. He was in the U.S.

98
00:09:41,694 --> 00:09:43,787
Tell him when you meet him.
- What?

99
00:09:43,863 --> 00:09:46,627
What you couldn't tell him
in 3 years of college.

100
00:09:46,699 --> 00:09:48,633
Niharika... shut up, Ok.

101
00:09:49,702 --> 00:09:51,636
Ok, Bye. See ya.
- Bye.

102
00:09:54,974 --> 00:09:57,636
Oh God!

103
00:10:00,713 --> 00:10:04,649
Where's the CD of my songs, joseph?

104
00:10:06,986 --> 00:10:11,980
Get lost! And don't you
dare touch my stuff.

105
00:10:12,058 --> 00:10:13,650
I'll break your legs.

106
00:10:14,994 --> 00:10:17,986
It's me!
- Tamanna?

107
00:10:19,732 --> 00:10:22,326
Has the air-conditioner in
your room stalled again?

108
00:10:22,402 --> 00:10:30,673
No. I couldn't go to sleep.
- No problem, my ac's working fine.

109
00:10:35,014 --> 00:10:37,676
May I sleep here?
- Sure

110
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:43,011
Niharika had called.
- Now...?

111
00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:45,182
Is everything all right?

112
00:10:46,025 --> 00:10:52,692
Guruji's birthday's coming up.
- Good. So when are you going?

113
00:10:55,034 --> 00:10:57,696
I don't think I'll be able
to make it this time.

114
00:10:58,037 --> 00:11:04,033
There's a lot of work to do for BSA.
- So turn Niharika down.

115
00:11:05,778 --> 00:11:08,713
But Rohit's coming this time

116
00:11:08,781 --> 00:11:12,717
Rohit? Manchanda...?

117
00:11:13,052 --> 00:11:14,713
Then, what are you thinking?

118
00:11:16,055 --> 00:11:19,718
We have the BSA account. And
Subbu won't let me go.

119
00:11:19,792 --> 00:11:23,228
You will go to the office every day.
But Rohit's not coming every day.

120
00:11:25,064 --> 00:11:29,728
You think I must talk to Subbu?
- Phone that old fossil right now!

121
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:33,732
Tanu! It's 2 'O clock!

122
00:11:34,073 --> 00:11:38,737
Forget it. I'll talk to him tomorrow.
- Now! Wake him up!

123
00:11:38,811 --> 00:11:42,747
Our own sleep's been blown away!
- Tanu, let go!

124
00:11:43,082 --> 00:11:45,744
Promise...? Tomorrow?
- Yes, of course

125
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:54,082
I'm so excited!
- I'm so sleepy.

126
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,094
And you are so boring.

127
00:11:59,832 --> 00:12:04,769
It'll be very tragic if we lose this
account of BSA cycles, Tamanna.

128
00:12:07,106 --> 00:12:10,769
They stood by us when
we had nothing else.

129
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:14,102
Remember, they are not
only our first account.

130
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:17,445
But till date, the biggest
source of revenue for us.

131
00:12:18,117 --> 00:12:22,281
I understand that, Subbu Sir.
But it's only for two days.

132
00:12:23,122 --> 00:12:27,115
In any case, our next meeting with
them is scheduled only for Friday.

133
00:12:28,127 --> 00:12:30,789
Well, whatever you feel like.

134
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:33,462
You're the one who deals with them
and makes all those presentations.

135
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:35,296
I don't interfere in these things.

136
00:12:36,936 --> 00:12:38,801
Subbu Sir...

137
00:12:42,141 --> 00:12:44,803
You trust me, don't you?

138
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,814
Of course, I do.

139
00:12:50,149 --> 00:12:53,812
Then please don't worry. I'll give
you no reason for complaints.

140
00:12:53,886 --> 00:12:55,820
Oh. C'mon, Tam.

141
00:12:57,323 --> 00:13:01,157
Have a great trip, Ok?
- Thanks.

142
00:13:40,933 --> 00:13:42,025
Hi.

143
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,381
That's not how it is, Rohit.

144
00:14:03,956 --> 00:14:10,885
If every good and bad deed were
to result in instant results...

145
00:14:10,963 --> 00:14:18,233
...there would be no element
of mystery to God's ways.

146
00:14:19,238 --> 00:14:23,902
And obviously, God wants to maintain
this element of secrecy.

147
00:14:24,977 --> 00:14:32,247
Rohit, maybe you never wanted
what you did not get...

148
00:14:32,318 --> 00:14:36,254
And that which your heart
craves for, I am sure...

149
00:14:36,322 --> 00:14:38,916
...you will certainly have.

150
00:14:58,611 --> 00:15:01,944
Why are you standing there,
Tamanna? Come here

151
00:15:16,295 --> 00:15:21,631
Happy Birthday, Guruji!
- Didn't I tell you she'd surely come?

152
00:15:22,301 --> 00:15:29,298
Look at him. When he studied here,
he'd go missing from class.

153
00:15:30,309 --> 00:15:37,647
And after going missing... he has
turned up now. Ten years later

154
00:15:39,318 --> 00:15:43,982
Long time, Rohit.
- Long time.

155
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,995
Go on.
- No, you speak

156
00:15:58,337 --> 00:16:03,331
Do you come here every year?
- Yes. On Guruji's birthday.

157
00:16:04,343 --> 00:16:06,504
But this time, I...

158
00:16:07,346 --> 00:16:10,008
Hi Tam.
- Hey, Niharika.

159
00:16:12,351 --> 00:16:14,012
Hi, Rohit.

160
00:16:14,687 --> 00:16:17,019
I hope you won't kill me now?
- Shut up, will you?

161
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,523
You've already turned
him into a coolie?

162
00:16:19,592 --> 00:16:21,025
I'm sorry.
- No problem.

163
00:16:22,528 --> 00:16:26,191
So when are you telling him?
- Shut up, Niharika

164
00:16:27,366 --> 00:16:28,697
What's going on?

165
00:16:28,768 --> 00:16:33,034
We students are painting a canvas
together. A little surprise for Guruji.

166
00:16:36,542 --> 00:16:40,034
Rohit, come on.
- Sanjay, look who's here!

167
00:16:46,385 --> 00:16:47,716
It's been so many years!

168
00:16:47,787 --> 00:16:50,221
Hi.
- Almost forgot your face man.

169
00:16:50,289 --> 00:16:53,053
But I can still remember the tunes
you played on the guitar.

170
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,558
How have you been?
- Good

171
00:16:54,627 --> 00:16:56,060
Miss you a lot.

172
00:16:57,129 --> 00:16:58,721
Hey, guys. Look who's here?

173
00:16:58,798 --> 00:17:02,393
This is Rohit. And we still
play the tunes he composed

174
00:17:02,468 --> 00:17:03,730
We still use them, you know.

175
00:17:03,803 --> 00:17:06,067
You must also paint
something for Guruj. I

176
00:17:06,138 --> 00:17:08,072
Yes, that's right.

177
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:13,071
Oh yes, go ahead!

178
00:17:18,417 --> 00:17:20,408
Sanjay! Listen! The
teacher has arrived.

179
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:27,086
What's happening here? What
are all of you doing?

180
00:17:27,159 --> 00:17:30,595
This is for you, Guruji.
- Happy Birthday, Guruji!

181
00:17:40,773 --> 00:17:42,604
Let's have a song, Rohit

182
00:17:44,443 --> 00:17:48,777
Why are you laughing? Must we wait
another 10 years to hear you sing?

183
00:17:48,848 --> 00:17:50,782
A hundred years.
- Wow! Good joke

184
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,442
Hey guys, get a guitar.

185
00:17:52,518 --> 00:17:57,114
Watch out, Rohit. If you don't
sing, maybe I'll have to...

186
00:17:57,189 --> 00:17:59,123
No! Please save us!

187
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:33,151
'Scents...

188
00:18:35,661 --> 00:18:39,153
...flowing from memory lane.'

189
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:41,165
'Windows...

190
00:18:43,502 --> 00:18:46,835
...opening to the gentle knocking
of moments past.'

191
00:18:47,506 --> 00:18:52,842
'Songs, held close to my heart...

192
00:18:54,513 --> 00:18:59,849
...and tunes I had forgotten...
now return to me.'

193
00:19:02,588 --> 00:19:06,684
'Every sign of life, I have
found all over again.'

194
00:19:09,862 --> 00:19:14,196
'Those lost shores, I've
chanced upon again.'

195
00:19:46,298 --> 00:19:52,237
Remember, Tamanna? You used to mumble
something to irritate me?

196
00:19:54,573 --> 00:19:59,738
Do you still mumble it?
- Some times...

197
00:20:00,312 --> 00:20:02,246
...When I think of you.

198
00:20:03,315 --> 00:20:06,580
Hoping to irritate you,
wherever you are.

199
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,915
Try it again. Let's see
if it still irritates me.

200
00:20:15,594 --> 00:20:16,925
After a long long consideration,
come to the conclusion...

201
00:20:16,996 --> 00:20:18,258
...matriculation examination...

202
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:20,264
...is a big big botheration
to the Indian nation whose...

203
00:20:20,332 --> 00:20:21,765
...main occupation is cultivation.

204
00:20:22,601 --> 00:20:24,262
One more time.

205
00:20:27,339 --> 00:20:28,931
After a long long consideration,
come to the conclusion...

206
00:20:29,008 --> 00:20:30,270
...matriculation examination...

207
00:20:30,342 --> 00:20:31,434
...is a big big botheration
to the Indian nation...

208
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,568
...whose main occupation
is cultivation.

209
00:20:32,678 --> 00:20:34,270
Please one more time.

210
00:20:39,351 --> 00:20:41,285
After a long long consideration,
come to the conclusion...

211
00:20:41,353 --> 00:20:42,445
...matriculation examination...

212
00:20:42,521 --> 00:20:44,614
...is a big big botheration
to the Indian nation, whose...

213
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:46,282
I can't say.

214
00:20:54,633 --> 00:20:57,625
Thanks, Tamanna.
- What for?

215
00:21:00,339 --> 00:21:02,307
Can't remember, when I
last laughed so much.

216
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,314
But one more time, please...?

217
00:21:10,382 --> 00:21:12,316
Shut up!

218
00:21:19,391 --> 00:21:21,655
Hi.
- Hi. How are you?

219
00:21:21,727 --> 00:21:24,662
Abstract. Interesting.
- Thank you.

220
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:26,664
Please. I won't disturb you.

221
00:21:37,676 --> 00:21:40,839
Hi.
- This is beautiful.

222
00:21:40,913 --> 00:21:43,347
You haven't lost your
touch, Niharika.

223
00:21:43,415 --> 00:21:46,350
I drop in some times. To kill time.

224
00:21:53,025 --> 00:21:54,686
He's not around.

225
00:21:55,694 --> 00:21:57,355
But I'm not looking for anyone.

226
00:21:58,697 --> 00:22:01,689
I told you. He's not around.

227
00:22:04,436 --> 00:22:05,869
So where is he?

228
00:22:05,938 --> 00:22:09,374
As if you don't know his
favorite hideouts.

229
00:22:13,712 --> 00:22:15,873
What are you doing...? Let it alone.

230
00:22:15,948 --> 00:22:19,384
I'm sorry. But it looks better
without the earring.

231
00:22:36,468 --> 00:22:38,902
I knew I'd find you here.

232
00:22:42,474 --> 00:22:44,408
Some things never change.

233
00:22:45,744 --> 00:22:48,406
Yes, some things never change.

234
00:22:48,747 --> 00:22:52,911
Isn't this the place you had
your guitar-practice at?

235
00:22:54,753 --> 00:22:57,415
Guruji had pinned a lot...

236
00:22:57,489 --> 00:23:00,424
...of hopes on me, hadn't he?
(Tamanna hopes, desire)

237
00:23:01,493 --> 00:23:03,427
And what are you doing nowadays?

238
00:23:06,498 --> 00:23:08,432
Not much.

239
00:23:09,501 --> 00:23:12,937
Niharika was telling me that
you've been in New York.

240
00:23:14,773 --> 00:23:18,436
Yes, I've spent a few years
of my life in New York.

241
00:23:20,512 --> 00:23:23,777
But my dreams... - Dreams? So
you've been sitting here...

242
00:23:23,849 --> 00:23:27,945
Hold on. Let me complete.

243
00:23:32,524 --> 00:23:37,461
Okay, what did you want to say?
- You are daydreaming here...

244
00:23:37,529 --> 00:23:39,793
...and everyone there's
looking for you.

245
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,791
I've been looking for someone too.

246
00:23:54,813 --> 00:23:56,474
Looks like I've found her.

247
00:24:03,989 --> 00:24:06,651
Yes, I have.

248
00:24:33,852 --> 00:24:37,515
That's a nice idea, Tamanna. We've
never done folk theater.

249
00:24:37,589 --> 00:24:39,523
Ok. That's settled then.

250
00:24:39,858 --> 00:24:41,519
The background score will be handled...

251
00:24:41,593 --> 00:24:43,185
...by our America-returned
music director.

252
00:24:43,262 --> 00:24:45,025
Right, Rohit?
- Sure.

253
00:24:45,097 --> 00:24:47,190
Great! How about starting tomorrow?

254
00:24:47,266 --> 00:24:49,530
By the way, guys, guess what?

255
00:24:49,601 --> 00:24:53,196
Rohit used to be very
good at gymnastics.

256
00:24:53,272 --> 00:24:56,207
Gymnastics! What nonsense!

257
00:24:56,275 --> 00:24:59,210
You don't know. Rohit is so good!

258
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:02,543
Had he not gone away to America
to pursue a career in music...

259
00:25:02,614 --> 00:25:05,549
...he'd have been India's
Olympics gymnast!

260
00:25:05,884 --> 00:25:07,545
You don't believe me?

261
00:25:08,053 --> 00:25:11,216
Show them the somersault routine.

262
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:13,554
Yes, go ahead. They haven't
seen you doing it.

263
00:25:14,893 --> 00:25:18,056
Make way, guys...

264
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:19,893
C'mon, Rohit...

265
00:25:20,899 --> 00:25:23,060
just look out for him.
- Yeah, we'll see.

266
00:25:23,135 --> 00:25:24,227
Yeah, buddy

267
00:25:24,303 --> 00:25:30,902
Ok. 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8.

268
00:25:31,643 --> 00:25:32,905
Side.

269
00:25:32,978 --> 00:25:34,240
All the best.

270
00:25:34,313 --> 00:25:36,577
Two somersaults. One twist.
- Ok.

271
00:25:52,931 --> 00:25:54,592
You are too good!

272
00:25:55,934 --> 00:25:57,595
Nice one, man.
- Thank you.

273
00:25:57,669 --> 00:25:59,603
Buddy, that was great!

274
00:26:00,939 --> 00:26:02,600
Amazing!

275
00:26:02,941 --> 00:26:04,602
It's very simple. You must try it.

276
00:26:05,277 --> 00:26:07,609
It's so easy. C'mon.

277
00:26:08,947 --> 00:26:12,610
Somersault of the year.
- Start with the right leg.

278
00:26:19,691 --> 00:26:22,626
Thank God your music's not
like your somersaults!

279
00:26:24,696 --> 00:26:28,632
Now that I'm here, I realize
how I missed all this.

280
00:26:28,967 --> 00:26:32,960
Don't you intend to go back then?

281
00:26:34,706 --> 00:26:36,640
I'll have to. For a few days.

282
00:26:38,977 --> 00:26:40,638
Will you be coming back?

283
00:26:41,914 --> 00:26:44,144
For good?
- For good.

284
00:26:49,721 --> 00:26:51,655
Great!

285
00:26:53,992 --> 00:26:56,654
I always knew it.
- What?

286
00:26:56,728 --> 00:26:59,663
That you'd come back.

287
00:27:28,026 --> 00:27:33,191
12 Dec 1994.

288
00:27:43,041 --> 00:27:45,032
Was it you who put it in there?

289
00:27:50,782 --> 00:27:54,047
Why did you hide it, Tamanna?
Why didn't you tell me?

290
00:27:57,055 --> 00:27:58,716
I was scared.

291
00:28:01,059 --> 00:28:03,721
If only you had told me then...

292
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:12,395
ten years of my lifetime wouldn't
have been... castaway.

293
00:28:27,252 --> 00:28:30,244
'Don't know much about History.'

294
00:28:31,089 --> 00:28:33,751
'Don't much about Biology.'

295
00:28:34,092 --> 00:28:37,084
'Don't know much about
my science books.'

296
00:28:37,829 --> 00:28:40,297
'Don't know much about
the French I took.'

297
00:28:41,099 --> 00:28:43,090
I do know that I love you.

298
00:28:43,168 --> 00:28:44,760
I love you Tammana.

299
00:28:44,836 --> 00:28:48,772
And if I know that you love
me too. Do you love me?

300
00:28:49,107 --> 00:28:52,099
What a wonderful world it'd be!

301
00:28:52,844 --> 00:28:56,302
What a wonderful world it'd be!

302
00:28:58,116 --> 00:29:06,285
What... a wonderful world... it'd be!

303
00:29:27,879 --> 00:29:35,809
'A shower of your love...

304
00:29:35,887 --> 00:29:42,816
...makes my path as vast as the
flowing, swelling oceans.'

305
00:29:42,894 --> 00:29:49,823
'Under your silken touch...

306
00:29:50,902 --> 00:29:56,499
...my dreams are awakened.'

307
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:02,505
'Every sign of life, I have
found all over again.'

308
00:30:02,581 --> 00:30:06,847
'Those lost shores, I've
chanced upon again.'

309
00:30:35,947 --> 00:30:42,876
'My passions are aroused... '

310
00:30:42,954 --> 00:30:50,884
...my darkest moments are lit up.'

311
00:30:50,962 --> 00:30:57,891
'You asked me to smile...

312
00:30:57,969 --> 00:31:05,569
...and Spring has returned to my life.'

313
00:31:06,244 --> 00:31:10,237
'Every sign of life, I have
found all over again.'

314
00:31:10,315 --> 00:31:13,910
'Those lost shores, I've
chanced upon again.'

315
00:31:36,007 --> 00:31:37,941
'Ln some joys.'

316
00:31:39,611 --> 00:31:43,604
'The breath mixed with each other.'

317
00:31:43,682 --> 00:31:45,274
'Some windows.'

318
00:31:47,285 --> 00:31:50,948
'They opened between eyes.'

319
00:31:51,022 --> 00:31:54,287
'A thirst unquenched.'

320
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:58,295
'A satin evening.'

321
00:31:58,363 --> 00:32:06,463
'The nights drowned in
some satin crimes.'

322
00:32:06,538 --> 00:32:10,975
'I got the signs to love.'

323
00:32:14,045 --> 00:32:17,981
'I got the lost shores.'

324
00:32:50,081 --> 00:32:54,017
I've found what my heart
always craved, Guruji

325
00:32:54,352 --> 00:33:00,018
May you be happy! You look
sweet when you smile.

326
00:33:01,092 --> 00:33:03,026
Take care.

327
00:35:08,219 --> 00:35:10,483
Love - the topic of the day.
Which give us pain and joy.

328
00:36:11,549 --> 00:36:17,215
Oh My God! Oh No!

329
00:36:18,556 --> 00:36:21,218
Where is the pencil? Oh God!

330
00:36:53,324 --> 00:36:57,260
Hell, Tamy. You could've at
least given me a phone call.

331
00:36:57,929 --> 00:36:59,260
Missed you.

332
00:36:59,931 --> 00:37:01,762
There was so much to do today.

333
00:37:07,605 --> 00:37:09,766
Why this long face?

334
00:37:12,343 --> 00:37:15,278
What happened? Didn't
Rohit show up there?

335
00:37:15,613 --> 00:37:17,274
He did.

336
00:37:18,616 --> 00:37:21,608
Rohit's number...? Great!

337
00:37:21,686 --> 00:37:23,278
I'm famished.

338
00:37:24,622 --> 00:37:28,285
Half the number.
- Why did he give you half of it?

339
00:37:28,359 --> 00:37:30,293
Is he crazy?

340
00:37:30,628 --> 00:37:35,292
Or was the other half meant to
be a riddle for you to solve?

341
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,292
That half got washed away
in the bath. - Washed away!

342
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:41,964
Why didn't you jot it down on
a paper before you took a bath?

343
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,304
How was I to know...
- C'mon!

344
00:37:44,809 --> 00:37:47,300
So I've made a mistake.

345
00:37:50,381 --> 00:37:52,315
Haven't you given him your number?
- No.

346
00:37:55,386 --> 00:37:57,320
Niharika must have his number!

347
00:38:00,658 --> 00:38:02,319
Oh yes!

348
00:38:17,408 --> 00:38:21,344
Jatin, will you bring Prashant
and Leela to my cabin, please?

349
00:38:26,417 --> 00:38:30,854
Good. Very interesting!

350
00:38:30,922 --> 00:38:32,355
Where are the tag lines?

351
00:38:36,694 --> 00:38:43,361
Try and skip the cliches, Thick,
silken tresses...

352
00:38:43,434 --> 00:38:45,368
If that's what every shampoo's
going to give them...

353
00:38:45,436 --> 00:38:47,370
...why would people buy
our client's brand?

354
00:38:48,439 --> 00:38:53,376
Jatin, I worked on some
lay-outs this morning.

355
00:38:53,444 --> 00:38:55,378
I want something like this.

356
00:38:55,713 --> 00:38:58,705
Take a close look at this.
Look at the color scheme.

357
00:38:58,783 --> 00:39:00,876
Hi.
- One moment, Prashant.

358
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,883
Is it ok?
- All right? - Any questions?

359
00:39:05,957 --> 00:39:08,050
No.
- So let's step on it.

360
00:39:08,126 --> 00:39:09,889
We've very little time.
- All right.

361
00:39:11,729 --> 00:39:14,892
Prashant, how about the BSA Ladybird?
- It's coming up.

362
00:39:16,734 --> 00:39:20,397
This is not done. You said it would
be ready by the time I returned.

363
00:39:20,471 --> 00:39:22,405
Yes, I did, but...

364
00:39:25,743 --> 00:39:30,407
BSA is anyway thinking of taking away
their products to another agency.

365
00:39:30,748 --> 00:39:34,081
And I'm trying my very best
to stop them from leaving us.

366
00:39:34,752 --> 00:39:37,084
Because we're the ones
in need. Not they.

367
00:39:37,155 --> 00:39:38,747
I know, but...

368
00:39:39,757 --> 00:39:42,749
How much more time?
- A day or two

369
00:39:42,827 --> 00:39:44,761
A day? Or two?

370
00:39:46,497 --> 00:39:47,964
Two.

371
00:39:48,766 --> 00:39:51,098
Leave a copy of the
brief on my table.

372
00:39:51,502 --> 00:39:54,096
I told you, Tam. Two Days.

373
00:39:54,772 --> 00:39:58,765
No problem. In the meanwhile, let
me see if another idea clicks.

374
00:39:58,843 --> 00:40:00,936
Because I'm meeting them
on Friday. All right.

375
00:40:01,779 --> 00:40:03,440
As you wish?

376
00:40:06,784 --> 00:40:09,947
Hello
- Hello, Murthy. Lunch?

377
00:40:10,021 --> 00:40:13,457
Eight to ten months? Which means,
we have enough time.

378
00:40:14,525 --> 00:40:16,459
Tamanna, times gonna fly.

379
00:40:16,527 --> 00:40:19,462
A lot many agencies are
approaching them...

380
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:22,795
...with great designs and
good track-records

381
00:40:23,534 --> 00:40:25,001
But I'm confident we'll get it.

382
00:40:25,536 --> 00:40:26,798
We are the best, you know.

383
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:55,162
Niharika? Any news?

384
00:40:55,233 --> 00:40:57,827
No, he hasn't even replied
to my emails.

385
00:40:57,902 --> 00:40:59,836
Why is he doing this?

386
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:02,998
Rohit will surely call.
- All right.

387
00:41:03,174 --> 00:41:04,835
Ok, fine.

388
00:42:09,907 --> 00:42:12,068
Good morning, Sapna.
- Good morning, sir.

389
00:42:12,143 --> 00:42:13,576
How are you?
- Fine sir.

390
00:42:38,669 --> 00:42:39,931
Tamanna...?

391
00:42:48,946 --> 00:42:51,779
Just go home. Go home.

392
00:42:52,683 --> 00:42:55,618
Subbu sir, I'm sorry.

393
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,781
I don't know when I fell asleep.

394
00:42:57,855 --> 00:42:59,618
Tam, just go home.

395
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:02,284
No, no, there's so much to do. The
meeting's coming up in 3-4 days.

396
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:05,955
You haven't been home in 2 days.
- I have a change of clothes here.

397
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:07,622
I'll be back in a moment.

398
00:43:10,968 --> 00:43:14,631
Just listen to me. Come back
only after lunch, okay?

399
00:43:21,712 --> 00:43:24,146
Is that Ms Tamanna Sahni?
- Yes.

400
00:43:24,215 --> 00:43:27,651
We found your card in your sister's
bag. She has met with an accident.

401
00:43:27,718 --> 00:43:30,152
She's been admitted to
the Manipal Hospital.

402
00:43:30,221 --> 00:43:32,655
Please meet Dr Rai Singh immediately.

403
00:43:40,731 --> 00:43:42,323
Dr. Rai Singh?
- Over there.

404
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,163
Straight?
- Yes. - Thanks.

405
00:43:48,739 --> 00:43:53,005
Dr. Rai Singh?
- Yes? - Tamanna Sahni.

406
00:43:53,077 --> 00:43:55,011
Please sit.

407
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:57,343
My sister...?
- She's fine

408
00:43:57,415 --> 00:43:59,679
It's not serious, I hope?
- Nothing serious.

409
00:44:00,017 --> 00:44:02,679
Just a hairline fracture and
a swelling on her head.

410
00:44:02,753 --> 00:44:04,687
Thank God, she was wearing a helmet.

411
00:44:05,022 --> 00:44:07,684
I'd like to go and see
her. Yeah sure.

412
00:44:12,029 --> 00:44:14,691
Hi Tania. How are you feeling now?

413
00:44:16,033 --> 00:44:19,025
Inspector, this is Tania's
sister Tamanna.

414
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:23,033
You'll have to collect your sister's
bike from the police station, madam.

415
00:44:23,107 --> 00:44:25,041
There'll be some paperwork to do.

416
00:44:25,209 --> 00:44:27,700
Right ma'am. Take care
of yourself. Thank you.

417
00:44:28,379 --> 00:44:30,040
Let me see those x-rays.

418
00:44:32,049 --> 00:44:35,712
How often have I asked you
not to speed so much?!

419
00:44:35,786 --> 00:44:39,051
Why don't you listen to me...?
- Please, Tammy!

420
00:44:42,059 --> 00:44:43,219
What if something serious
had happened?

421
00:44:43,294 --> 00:44:48,732
Please stop crying, Tammy. I'm okay.
- You're telling me?

422
00:44:51,068 --> 00:44:53,229
Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Not at all.

423
00:44:53,304 --> 00:44:55,067
We have the x-rays and prescriptions.

424
00:44:55,139 --> 00:44:56,731
You'll have to send for the medicines

425
00:44:59,076 --> 00:45:01,738
By the way, she had a
cut vein in the calf...

426
00:45:01,812 --> 00:45:03,245
...so we had to give her some blood.

427
00:45:03,314 --> 00:45:06,750
As a policy, you must replace it.
B-positive, if possible.

428
00:45:06,817 --> 00:45:10,753
I'm B-positive too.
- That's good.

429
00:45:41,118 --> 00:45:43,279
Yeah, jatin. I should be
there in thirty minutes.

430
00:45:44,288 --> 00:45:46,779
Oh God!
- Ready in five minutes. - So am I.

431
00:45:47,858 --> 00:45:50,793
Tell Sada to at least order
printer cartridges on time.

432
00:45:51,128 --> 00:45:53,289
Ok, sure.
- What a waste of time!

433
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:01,804
Oh God! Right timing.

434
00:46:06,877 --> 00:46:09,311
Tamanna?
- Yes?

435
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:12,816
I got something important to talk
to you about. Can you come over?

436
00:46:12,883 --> 00:46:16,979
Is Tania all right?
- Tania? She's fine.

437
00:46:18,155 --> 00:46:19,315
Tam, they arewaiting.

438
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:20,823
Meet me as soon as come.
I'll be right here.

439
00:46:20,891 --> 00:46:23,325
But Tania...
- She's fine.

440
00:46:23,394 --> 00:46:26,158
Just come and see me.
I'll be waiting, okay?

441
00:46:27,498 --> 00:46:29,159
Thanks.
- Bye.

442
00:46:31,168 --> 00:46:34,501
How about those reports of the test
we sent for a reconfirmation?

443
00:46:34,572 --> 00:46:35,834
Prashant, one minute. - Yeah.

444
00:46:35,906 --> 00:46:37,066
I got to leave for the
hospital immediately.

445
00:46:40,177 --> 00:46:42,509
Could you go over to BSA for
the first meeting, please?

446
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:43,842
As you wish.

447
00:46:44,181 --> 00:46:46,843
Don't worry. They are 990/0 convinced.

448
00:46:47,184 --> 00:46:49,345
Just make this presentation there.

449
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,852
I'll take Tania home
and give you a call.

450
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:57,350
What's up?
- What's up?

451
00:46:57,428 --> 00:47:00,864
That's what I want to know. What's
up? - What's that about?

452
00:47:01,932 --> 00:47:07,199
What happened?
- Someone delivered a baby boy.

453
00:47:07,271 --> 00:47:09,865
There were some showers
and there was also said...

454
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:12,374
...to be a bomb blast somewhere.

455
00:47:12,443 --> 00:47:15,207
That's what's been happening.
Nothing else

456
00:47:17,948 --> 00:47:19,939
Why did Dr Rai Singh call
me over so urgently?

457
00:47:20,017 --> 00:47:23,043
I'm not Tania Rai Singh to know. Am I?

458
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:28,886
I'm just packing my bags. Subi and
Ross are coming to pick me up.

459
00:47:29,059 --> 00:47:31,892
I thought you were here
to take me home.

460
00:47:31,962 --> 00:47:36,058
Anyway, you can go back to the office
after getting me a discharge.

461
00:47:36,133 --> 00:47:39,899
My friends will drop me home.
- So you're taking a dig at me?

462
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:43,497
Of course. How often have you
come to see me in the hospital?

463
00:47:43,974 --> 00:47:46,169
Tanu, stop acting like a baby.

464
00:47:46,243 --> 00:47:48,074
Don't you know how much work
I have at the office?

465
00:47:48,145 --> 00:47:52,081
Sure, I do. That old
Subu also called.

466
00:47:52,149 --> 00:47:55,983
How are you, my child? How
are you? Get well soon.

467
00:47:56,053 --> 00:47:58,521
Tanu, that's very very mean.

468
00:47:58,589 --> 00:48:02,650
We'll go home after I see the
doctor, okay? I'll back.

469
00:48:05,996 --> 00:48:09,432
You're not angry with me over
this stupid accident, are you?

470
00:48:12,002 --> 00:48:14,596
I just wanted to say that I'm angry.

471
00:48:15,105 --> 00:48:18,472
Don't act silly. I'm not angry, okay?

472
00:48:18,542 --> 00:48:21,670
I thought that was the reason
why you didn't come to see me

473
00:48:25,349 --> 00:48:27,943
There was such a huge backlog of BSA...

474
00:48:28,018 --> 00:48:31,283
...as soon as it's over, we'll
go on a long holiday.

475
00:48:31,355 --> 00:48:34,119
Promise.
- Promise.

476
00:48:35,292 --> 00:48:38,955
May I go now? And see Dr Rai Singh?

477
00:48:39,029 --> 00:48:40,963
We've got to go home.

478
00:48:41,031 --> 00:48:43,363
Let's have a long chat
once we get home, okay?

479
00:48:45,202 --> 00:48:49,468
You said you wanted to talk
to me. I'm so sorry I'm late.

480
00:48:50,474 --> 00:48:52,635
Doctor, you've looked after
Tania so well.

481
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:54,644
I just don't know how to thank you.

482
00:49:02,052 --> 00:49:05,317
Can I take Tania home?

483
00:49:06,056 --> 00:49:12,052
Tamanna, listen carefully to
what I'm about to tell you

484
00:49:12,162 --> 00:49:15,154
Tania...? Is there...?

485
00:49:15,232 --> 00:49:17,496
She's perfectly fine.

486
00:49:18,068 --> 00:49:22,004
It's the blood sample you gave us,
we sent it to the lab for a test...

487
00:49:22,072 --> 00:49:25,530
...as we do in every case.

488
00:49:26,076 --> 00:49:30,012
Usually, there is no need for us to
tell the patient about the results.

489
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:33,516
I just felt that you should know.

490
00:49:35,185 --> 00:49:38,746
Your blood is HIV-positive.

491
00:49:41,258 --> 00:49:45,024
Tamanna, I'm sorry. Without your
permission, I got an eliza test done...

492
00:49:45,095 --> 00:49:48,690
...to reconfirm the results.

493
00:49:49,099 --> 00:49:51,192
That was positive too.

494
00:49:59,443 --> 00:50:02,435
Tamanna, your parents have
met with an accident.

495
00:50:02,513 --> 00:50:04,378
Their car has fallen in a gorge.

496
00:50:11,121 --> 00:50:17,788
Tamanna, don't be under the
impression that you have AIDS.

497
00:50:18,228 --> 00:50:21,391
The virus hasn't started spreading
in your body yet.

498
00:50:21,465 --> 00:50:25,561
If you wish, you could even have
a western blot test conducted.

499
00:50:28,138 --> 00:50:34,270
I wish you would see a counselor
to overcome the shock.

500
00:50:35,245 --> 00:50:40,080
And yes, you will have to take
better care of your health.

501
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:45,417
There will be medicines
to take... once in month.

502
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:55,421
God!

503
00:50:57,167 --> 00:50:58,498
Save me!

504
00:51:57,494 --> 00:51:59,223
It's enough.

505
00:51:59,329 --> 00:52:01,320
Hey! Here she is.

506
00:52:03,233 --> 00:52:04,495
Let's go.

507
00:52:06,236 --> 00:52:08,830
Now be careful. Don't trip and fall.

508
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,231
Don't worry. She's ok.

509
00:52:12,309 --> 00:52:14,573
Let's go. I'm driving.

510
00:52:51,281 --> 00:52:54,546
Why are you so tongue-tied...?

511
00:52:55,285 --> 00:52:58,880
And you said we'd have
a long chat at home?

512
00:53:02,292 --> 00:53:07,229
Worried about BSA?
What an idiot I am!

513
00:53:07,297 --> 00:53:10,892
You already have so many worries.
And I keep talking nonsense.

514
00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:42,321
HIV.

515
00:53:46,336 --> 00:53:49,430
I can't figure out anything.

516
00:53:50,507 --> 00:53:57,936
How did it happen...? When?

517
00:53:59,616 --> 00:54:02,676
I never had a blood transfusion.

518
00:54:06,356 --> 00:54:09,792
No injections.

519
00:54:17,367 --> 00:54:21,463
Yes, there was this special girl.
The best thing about her was that...

520
00:54:21,538 --> 00:54:25,474
...apart from me, there were
nine other guys in her life.

521
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:36,043
You know. You don't even have to say
that I love when you are in love.

522
00:54:43,493 --> 00:54:47,657
Six. Six Vows

523
00:54:50,601 --> 00:54:53,001
Will you take the
seventh one with me?

524
00:54:55,505 --> 00:55:00,340
C'mon. Be original. Say yes.

525
00:55:02,412 --> 00:55:04,744
Rohit... I...

526
00:55:53,463 --> 00:55:55,727
Good morning.

527
00:56:03,473 --> 00:56:06,738
What are staring at?
- You.

528
00:56:07,477 --> 00:56:10,571
The one I only dreamt of.

529
00:56:38,508 --> 00:56:40,499
Rohit...?

530
00:57:17,814 --> 00:57:21,477
We are sorry. The number you have
reached is not in service.

531
00:57:21,551 --> 00:57:24,486
Please check the number
or try your call again.

532
00:57:24,554 --> 00:57:26,488
This is a recording

533
00:57:28,558 --> 00:57:32,756
Niharika, you're the one Rohit
called earlier, isn't it?

534
00:57:32,829 --> 00:57:37,493
That's true, but I've tried all
the numbers Rohit had given me...

535
00:57:37,567 --> 00:57:41,503
...but there has been no response.
I've asked all his friends here...

536
00:57:41,571 --> 00:57:45,564
...but none of them knows anything.
He's untraceable.

537
00:57:45,642 --> 00:57:49,669
Please keep trying Niharika.
- Sure, Tania.

538
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:54,016
Sorry. Your call cannot
be completely dialed.

539
00:57:54,084 --> 00:57:56,177
Please check the number and dial...

540
00:58:11,868 --> 00:58:17,534
Hello. - Hello. - Could
I speak to Rohit please.

541
00:58:25,949 --> 00:58:28,884
Has Tam had something to eat?
- No.

542
00:58:36,059 --> 00:58:40,223
Hello, is Rohit there?
- I'm sorry. It's a wrong number.

543
00:58:59,916 --> 00:59:03,647
There's mail from one of our
listeners, but there's no name.

544
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:08,589
She writes that her sister is
presently facing a very severe...

545
00:59:08,658 --> 00:59:11,786
...problem which makes
her keep very silent

546
00:59:11,862 --> 00:59:14,092
But you needn't worry at all!

547
00:59:14,164 --> 00:59:17,600
Tanya is here for you
with her magic wand.

548
00:59:17,667 --> 00:59:20,659
She will request your sister...

549
00:59:20,737 --> 00:59:27,666
Why do you make our listener so sad?
Why don't you talk to her?

550
00:59:27,744 --> 00:59:32,613
She loves you so dearly and
can't bear to see you sad.

551
00:59:32,682 --> 00:59:35,674
And this is the song
she dedicates to you

552
00:59:35,952 --> 00:59:39,945
'Smile...

553
00:59:40,023 --> 00:59:43,618
...and let grief be ashamed.'

554
00:59:46,096 --> 00:59:53,628
'Let the raindrops make a gentle
patter as they descend to the ground.'

555
01:00:09,986 --> 01:00:16,653
'Lt's what the breeze says...

556
01:00:20,730 --> 01:00:23,665
...come, let's sway together.'

557
01:00:23,733 --> 01:00:31,003
'Let's kiss the skies together.'

558
01:00:41,017 --> 01:00:46,683
Look at this Tammy. Your photo's on
the cover-page of Business Today.

559
01:01:01,972 --> 01:01:04,702
I'm so happy.

560
01:01:09,879 --> 01:01:12,370
Nothing's happening to you, Tammy.

561
01:01:12,782 --> 01:01:19,119
'Serenity is like a lake.
It's part of you.'

562
01:01:19,189 --> 01:01:25,719
'Mischief is like the rivers.
It flows ahead of you.'

563
01:01:25,795 --> 01:01:32,724
'Peel off the facade of sorrow.
Let the world rejoice.'

564
01:01:32,802 --> 01:01:40,072
'Let the tiny pebbles
tickle your soles... '

565
01:01:40,143 --> 01:01:46,082
'lt's there in the breeze... '

566
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:52,420
...come, let's sway together.'

567
01:01:52,822 --> 01:02:00,092
'Let's kiss the skies.'

568
01:02:39,869 --> 01:02:41,860
Good morning.

569
01:02:43,873 --> 01:02:45,135
What is it?

570
01:02:45,208 --> 01:02:46,800
Nothing.

571
01:02:53,883 --> 01:02:55,874
I'll see you in the evening.

572
01:03:04,894 --> 01:03:07,829
Do you think it'll take
time for my photo...

573
01:03:07,897 --> 01:03:09,330
...to appear on Business Today?

574
01:03:09,899 --> 01:03:15,838
No.
- I don't think so too. Bye.

575
01:03:34,357 --> 01:03:37,849
Hi Leela. Good morning, Sapna.

576
01:04:09,959 --> 01:04:11,551
Yes.

577
01:04:12,962 --> 01:04:14,224
You...?

578
01:04:14,297 --> 01:04:16,390
I'm the creative head.
May I help you?

579
01:04:19,969 --> 01:04:23,905
I guess. I'll have to help myself.

580
01:04:25,975 --> 01:04:27,567
I don't think this copy works.

581
01:04:27,644 --> 01:04:31,978
The morning light waves
and anticipation and all that.

582
01:04:32,048 --> 01:04:34,516
I think it will go over the
consumer's head.

583
01:04:34,584 --> 01:04:36,245
I think we should be
little more direct.

584
01:04:55,271 --> 01:04:56,602
Later.

585
01:05:20,029 --> 01:05:21,963
How are you keeping, Tamanna?

586
01:05:22,031 --> 01:05:23,965
Who's that in my cabin?

587
01:05:32,208 --> 01:05:35,473
That man in the cabin is Suresh.

588
01:05:36,212 --> 01:05:38,476
May I know... why?

589
01:05:40,049 --> 01:05:42,984
We barely managed to save BSA
from slipping out of our hands.

590
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:50,987
I... I had already presented my
designs and they were very impressed.

591
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:54,393
It was Prashant who presented
the designs.

592
01:05:54,464 --> 01:05:56,659
You had only had a discussion.

593
01:05:57,066 --> 01:06:00,331
Who presented them makes
no difference.

594
01:06:00,403 --> 01:06:02,394
I was the one who made
the designs, isn't it?

595
01:06:02,472 --> 01:06:05,999
Their account is here
because of my work!

596
01:06:06,075 --> 01:06:10,671
That's what you think. But
they were very very upset.

597
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:16,684
You didn't attend a
meeting with them.

598
01:06:18,087 --> 01:06:26,017
It was first Tania's accident. After
that came your own personal health.

599
01:06:28,197 --> 01:06:31,758
Our company almost lost
the BSA account.

600
01:06:35,104 --> 01:06:38,039
Business needs discipline, Tamanna.

601
01:06:40,109 --> 01:06:44,045
But my work was perfect, sir.

602
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:48,546
Your termination letter will explain
the rest of the details to you.

603
01:07:05,468 --> 01:07:09,063
It was nice... nice working
with you, sir.

604
01:07:36,699 --> 01:07:41,102
I've been ruined, sir! The insurance
guys have rejected my claim.

605
01:07:41,170 --> 01:07:44,571
Delay your premium by a day and
these guys wring your neck.

606
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:47,768
And now...
- Enough. Thank you Mr. Yogi.

607
01:07:48,444 --> 01:07:53,279
Do you have another business
apart from the timber mart?

608
01:07:53,349 --> 01:07:57,285
No, I don't. Else, I wouldn't
have been in such dire straits.

609
01:07:57,353 --> 01:08:02,120
I invested all I had in this
business, sir. You must help me now.

610
01:08:02,191 --> 01:08:05,126
Please answer only the questions
you are asked.

611
01:08:05,194 --> 01:08:07,128
Thank you, sir.

612
01:08:07,196 --> 01:08:11,292
What did you do with the ashes
of the timber that was burnt?

613
01:08:11,401 --> 01:08:13,733
I object. Is this a joke!

614
01:08:13,803 --> 01:08:16,533
Mr. Anand!
- Of course, sir. Give me a moment.

615
01:08:16,606 --> 01:08:22,476
I'll be back. Here you go.

616
01:08:22,545 --> 01:08:24,137
That's for you.

617
01:08:24,213 --> 01:08:28,309
Mr Yogi... do you recognize this?

618
01:08:30,219 --> 01:08:32,813
Very good.

619
01:08:32,889 --> 01:08:35,483
Sir, this is a receipt from Sudha
foundries for a ton of coal...

620
01:08:35,558 --> 01:08:38,493
...purchased from our
very own Mr. Yogi.

621
01:08:38,561 --> 01:08:46,161
Mr. Yogi sold the charcoal of the
burnt timber to Sudha Foundries.

622
01:08:46,235 --> 01:08:49,898
The price of the charcoal was far
more than the price of the timber.

623
01:08:50,239 --> 01:08:55,176
Hence my client is not liable
to pay Mr. Yogi a single penny.

624
01:08:56,345 --> 01:08:58,779
You honor, my client would
like to withdraw this case.

625
01:08:58,848 --> 01:09:00,577
Very good decision.

626
01:09:00,650 --> 01:09:02,777
Thank you, your honor.
Have a very good day.

627
01:09:02,852 --> 01:09:04,183
Let's go.

628
01:09:08,424 --> 01:09:12,190
Yes, sir. I get it. Thank you. Bye.

629
01:09:12,462 --> 01:09:18,264
Hi Tarun. - Hello Divya.
How are you? - I'm fine.

630
01:09:18,334 --> 01:09:22,862
Hello Tarun. - Hi Kalpu. We're
still meeting for coffee?

631
01:09:28,444 --> 01:09:32,210
Well
- Well?

632
01:09:33,282 --> 01:09:35,546
And.
- And?

633
01:09:36,285 --> 01:09:40,221
Oh! What happened?
- What do you think?

634
01:09:40,289 --> 01:09:43,747
Oh, I'm sorry. Better luck next time.

635
01:09:44,293 --> 01:09:46,420
Damn it! I've won!

636
01:09:46,496 --> 01:09:48,225
What?
- What is this, man?

637
01:09:48,297 --> 01:09:49,821
Great! Congrats!
- Yeah, Thank you.

638
01:09:49,899 --> 01:09:52,231
Did you win or lose, Tarun?

639
01:09:52,301 --> 01:09:54,394
Now what is your problem...?

640
01:09:54,470 --> 01:09:55,835
I'm sorry.
- I'm a good lawyer.

641
01:09:55,905 --> 01:09:57,896
Congrats! - No, I'm a good lawyer.
Have some faith.

642
01:09:57,974 --> 01:10:00,408
I don't know why everybody in
this office is picking on me.

643
01:10:02,311 --> 01:10:04,245
I won.

644
01:10:04,313 --> 01:10:06,304
Well.
- Well?

645
01:10:07,316 --> 01:10:09,841
So.
- So?

646
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:13,252
Tamanna Sahni.
- Yes.

647
01:10:13,322 --> 01:10:15,654
In there. Since half an hour.

648
01:10:16,325 --> 01:10:17,986
Oh Shit!

649
01:10:18,594 --> 01:10:21,654
Do me a favor, babes. Send
two cups of coffee, please

650
01:10:21,731 --> 01:10:22,993
Ok.
- Thank you.

651
01:10:26,602 --> 01:10:28,661
Hello. Hi.
- Hello.

652
01:10:29,872 --> 01:10:31,601
Hi Tamanna. Nice to meet you.

653
01:10:31,674 --> 01:10:35,610
Did Rosanne tell you...
- Yes, she told me. Please sit.

654
01:10:37,346 --> 01:10:39,337
That's fine.
- Yes.

655
01:10:40,616 --> 01:10:42,948
I've ordered for a filing cabinet.

656
01:10:43,019 --> 01:10:46,785
Rosy was telling me that you
had a problem with your job?

657
01:10:46,856 --> 01:10:48,949
Come in.
- Yes, and that is why I...

658
01:10:49,358 --> 01:10:51,952
Coffee. Will you have some coffee?
- Yeah, sure.

659
01:10:52,028 --> 01:10:54,622
Good. Let me put this away.

660
01:10:57,533 --> 01:11:00,297
Thank you.
- Thank you.

661
01:11:01,637 --> 01:11:03,969
So...

662
01:11:06,375 --> 01:11:09,902
...this place you were working at?
You were sacked without a reason?

663
01:11:09,979 --> 01:11:13,813
Yes. From Tj Associates. I want
to file a suit against them.

664
01:11:13,883 --> 01:11:17,046
They claim I wasn't doing
my job properly.

665
01:11:26,395 --> 01:11:32,664
They cite incompetence and
negligence. What do you have to say?

666
01:11:33,502 --> 01:11:35,663
Because I'm HIV-positive.

667
01:11:40,409 --> 01:11:42,343
Excuse me.

668
01:11:42,411 --> 01:11:44,345
HIV-positive!

669
01:11:48,417 --> 01:11:52,080
You've AIDS?
- No. AIDS is a different stage.

670
01:11:52,622 --> 01:11:56,353
Until the HIV virus attacks
the blood cells...

671
01:11:56,425 --> 01:12:00,361
...it remains dormant in
one's body. Till then...

672
01:12:00,630 --> 01:12:05,533
When is AIDS likely to happen? - 
Maybe tomorrow. Maybe 15 or 20 years.

673
01:12:05,601 --> 01:12:09,367
It all depends on how one
looks himself oneself.

674
01:12:09,538 --> 01:12:11,870
Medication...
- Hold on, hold on.

675
01:12:14,777 --> 01:12:16,870
Ms. Sahni, I get your point.

676
01:12:18,614 --> 01:12:20,377
Your boss claims you were sacked...

677
01:12:20,449 --> 01:12:22,610
...because you weren't
doing a job properly...

678
01:12:22,685 --> 01:12:26,553
And you insist he sacked you because
you're an AIDS patient?

679
01:12:26,622 --> 01:12:30,991
HIV positive.
- Yeah, sorry. HIV

680
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:32,391
He fired you because he didn't want...

681
01:12:32,461 --> 01:12:35,396
...an HIV-positive patient
in his office?

682
01:12:35,464 --> 01:12:37,796
Right?
- Yes

683
01:12:38,467 --> 01:12:40,458
That's exactly why I was fired.

684
01:12:47,476 --> 01:12:51,139
Mr. Anand?
- Yes.

685
01:12:55,484 --> 01:12:58,976
Miss Sahni, I'm a corporate lawyer.
And this is a case of employment.

686
01:12:59,055 --> 01:13:01,580
This is not my field or expertise.

687
01:13:01,657 --> 01:13:04,751
All I can suggest is that
you consult a specialist...

688
01:13:04,827 --> 01:13:09,423
Sure. Eleven lawyers before you
have given me the same advice.

689
01:13:09,665 --> 01:13:11,826
Anyway, thanks for your time.

690
01:13:27,715 --> 01:13:30,809
Just relax, I say.
- Relax, my foot!

691
01:13:30,885 --> 01:13:34,321
She sat there in my office,
just a couple of feet away.

692
01:13:34,722 --> 01:13:36,656
She touched my hand,
gave me the coffee...

693
01:13:36,724 --> 01:13:38,658
She was breathing on me.

694
01:13:39,727 --> 01:13:41,718
Your BP is very much normal.

695
01:13:42,063 --> 01:13:47,000
And this is how HIV virus
got only through blood...

696
01:13:47,068 --> 01:13:51,664
I know, I know. Blood, bodily fluid,
semen... I studied in school.

697
01:13:51,739 --> 01:13:53,673
But I just wanted to make
sure. I was so scared.

698
01:13:53,741 --> 01:13:57,677
But why? You don't contract it by
sitting together, by shaking hands...

699
01:13:57,745 --> 01:14:00,839
...by breathing the same air, not
even by kissing each other.

700
01:14:01,015 --> 01:14:08,683
Oh yes, if there is something
in your past that...

701
01:14:08,756 --> 01:14:13,022
What's that?
- I'm taking your blood for a test

702
01:14:13,294 --> 01:14:17,697
HIV-test? You know me since
our school days, Bunty!

703
01:14:17,765 --> 01:14:20,097
No wonder.
- Shut up!

704
01:14:20,868 --> 01:14:27,103
Have you ever done drugs? Or
been to a prostitute perhaps?

705
01:14:27,175 --> 01:14:31,908
Call girl? - Thank you very much,
buddy. I'll see you at dinner.

706
01:14:32,981 --> 01:14:37,042
Have you had sex with a stranger,
without the protection of a condom...?

707
01:14:50,064 --> 01:14:54,398
Tarun, this is Rossane. Are you free?
I need to have a word with you.

708
01:14:54,902 --> 01:15:00,238
This friend of yours,
Rosy. I'm sorry...

709
01:15:00,308 --> 01:15:04,745
No, Tarun. It's my mistake
that I sent her to you

710
01:15:04,812 --> 01:15:07,337
How could you do this?
- Won't you hear me out?

711
01:15:07,415 --> 01:15:08,746
Looks my opinion about you was wrong.

712
01:15:08,816 --> 01:15:11,808
But I know Tamanna well. She
will never concede defeat.

713
01:15:11,886 --> 01:15:14,753
Anyway, she doesn't need your
help and she will manage...

714
01:15:51,125 --> 01:15:52,786
How often has jH Industries
filed claims...

715
01:15:52,860 --> 01:15:55,124
...for insurance in the last 5 years?

716
01:15:55,196 --> 01:15:59,394
And what is the condition of
their fire prevention system?

717
01:16:02,870 --> 01:16:07,136
You think jH Industries deliberately
started a fire in their stores?

718
01:16:07,208 --> 01:16:10,302
For insurance?
- Guess what?

719
01:16:10,878 --> 01:16:11,970
Therefore, maybe there are many
instances of fire there.

720
01:16:12,046 --> 01:16:13,138
The directors burn in the fire
of jealousy with each other.

721
01:16:13,214 --> 01:16:14,806
And the employers are jealous
of the directors.

722
01:16:14,882 --> 01:16:16,144
JH Industries is always on fire!

723
01:16:22,890 --> 01:16:26,326
Mr Satsangi's sure feeling
the heat all right.

724
01:16:26,394 --> 01:16:27,554
Let's work.

725
01:16:28,996 --> 01:16:34,491
Ok boys, the cases are Kamani
industries versus National Insurance.

726
01:16:34,902 --> 01:16:37,837
KGB Mills versus Indian Under writers.

727
01:16:37,905 --> 01:16:40,499
And ruling in supreme court
given by Khanna Shoes versus...

728
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:42,566
...National Insurance company.

729
01:16:51,185 --> 01:16:53,016
Carry on, I'll join you soon.
- Ok.

730
01:17:13,141 --> 01:17:21,207
Excuse me... - Oh, I'm sorry. - 
I thought I wouldn't find it. - 

731
01:17:21,282 --> 01:17:24,547
Excuse me. Ms. Tamanna Sahni, right?
- Yes.

732
01:17:24,619 --> 01:17:26,610
Have you found a lawyer?
- Yes.

733
01:17:26,954 --> 01:17:29,889
Who is it?
- Tamanna Sahni.

734
01:17:30,958 --> 01:17:34,052
Taking on the entire responsibility...
good.

735
01:17:34,962 --> 01:17:38,295
One has to put up a fight. Even
if one has to do it on his own.

736
01:17:38,366 --> 01:17:40,391
That much right we all
enjoy, don't we?

737
01:17:40,968 --> 01:17:43,061
You're a quick learner.

738
01:17:43,137 --> 01:17:44,900
I already pity the lawyers who are...

739
01:17:44,972 --> 01:17:46,564
...going to represent Tj Associates.

740
01:17:47,975 --> 01:17:50,239
Are you poking fun at me, Mr. Anand?

741
01:17:52,980 --> 01:17:54,914
Just a bit.

742
01:17:54,982 --> 01:17:59,919
I know, I'm being pigheaded
in trying to learn all this.

743
01:17:59,987 --> 01:18:03,923
But I can't help it. It isn't easy
to convince lawyers nowadays.

744
01:18:03,991 --> 01:18:05,982
I'm speaking on a personal experience.

745
01:18:08,996 --> 01:18:15,663
I'd like to fight your
case. If you agree.

746
01:18:19,540 --> 01:18:22,941
There's not much I know
about HIV-related cases.

747
01:18:23,010 --> 01:18:25,035
In fact, this will be
my first such case.

748
01:18:25,112 --> 01:18:28,275
However, there is someone
I know who can guide us.

749
01:18:28,349 --> 01:18:33,286
Really? - Yes, I'd like
to have a word with him.

750
01:18:36,457 --> 01:18:43,954
I've to go. I got to attend a hearing.
But I'll be in touch. Take care, Ok?

751
01:18:44,031 --> 01:18:46,295
Yeah, thank you.
- Bye.

752
01:18:49,036 --> 01:18:51,971
Your phone number... never mind.
I'll take it from Rosy.

753
01:19:05,253 --> 01:19:09,383
Tammy... has Friends begun?
- Long ago.

754
01:19:11,325 --> 01:19:13,384
Hi, how are you?

755
01:19:15,329 --> 01:19:20,995
You know Tarun, Rossane's friend?

756
01:19:21,068 --> 01:19:23,400
Volume, Tammy. Volume.

757
01:19:24,071 --> 01:19:28,007
Tarun's ready to fight my case.

758
01:19:31,245 --> 01:19:34,180
What did you say...?
- What did I say?

759
01:19:34,248 --> 01:19:37,684
You just said something about
Rossane's friend and the case...?

760
01:19:38,085 --> 01:19:40,679
He's ready to fight it.
- What?

761
01:19:40,755 --> 01:19:43,519
Lts hours since I got home
and you're telling me now?

762
01:19:43,591 --> 01:19:46,685
Sorry, I made a mistake. Okay?
- Not fair!

763
01:19:46,761 --> 01:19:51,095
You're so quiet and I'm so happy!
- Thanks.

764
01:19:51,198 --> 01:19:55,430
What else did he have to say?
- That's my bottle...

765
01:19:56,270 --> 01:20:01,230
So...? I'll catch the HIV infection?

766
01:20:01,309 --> 01:20:04,540
Shut up! You talk any nonsense!
- You shut up, Tammy.

767
01:20:04,612 --> 01:20:06,045
Stop discriminating against yourself...

768
01:20:06,113 --> 01:20:08,707
...before you expect it
from the others

769
01:20:17,124 --> 01:20:22,391
I'm sorry.
- It's ok.

770
01:20:23,331 --> 01:20:27,233
They call him Lal Sir. He teaches
at the law school here.

771
01:20:27,301 --> 01:20:30,793
He used to practice at the Shearman
and Sterling in America.

772
01:20:31,138 --> 01:20:33,231
He even fought an AIDS-related
case there.

773
01:20:33,307 --> 01:20:35,673
Hi, Lal sir... how are you?

774
01:20:35,743 --> 01:20:36,801
Fine, how are you.

775
01:20:36,877 --> 01:20:40,574
You got your boss's permission?
- Satsangi...? That's no problem.

776
01:20:40,648 --> 01:20:42,240
What happened to that insurance case?

777
01:20:42,316 --> 01:20:45,251
I don't think they're gonna miss me.
- Ok. Come.

778
01:20:45,419 --> 01:20:49,082
Sir, I thought we could go in my car.
- You know about me.

779
01:20:49,156 --> 01:20:52,148
Sir, I've just bought it. It's a
new car. I want you to ride it.

780
01:20:52,226 --> 01:20:54,421
Ok. My wishes. Just
come with me. Come.

781
01:20:55,162 --> 01:20:58,757
C'mon. I bet it won't start.

782
01:21:03,170 --> 01:21:07,436
Let's go.
- You've to push.

783
01:21:08,175 --> 01:21:09,767
I knew it.

784
01:21:16,183 --> 01:21:20,779
Ready.
- Yeah. - Ok. Here we go.

785
01:21:22,390 --> 01:21:24,187
Try it now.
- Yeah.

786
01:21:28,195 --> 01:21:30,186
Try it again.

787
01:21:35,202 --> 01:21:36,464
Thank you.

788
01:21:44,211 --> 01:21:47,806
Why did you accept Tamanna Sahni's
brief in the first place?

789
01:21:49,216 --> 01:21:53,312
Is it necessary to tell you?
- Yes, it's a difficult case.

790
01:21:53,387 --> 01:21:56,481
You need to be clear as to
why you are accepting it.

791
01:22:01,495 --> 01:22:04,658
I actually became a lawyer
to help people, sir.

792
01:22:06,333 --> 01:22:09,166
But in the last two years,
I've been caught up...

793
01:22:09,236 --> 01:22:11,898
...with big firms, big
cases and the works.

794
01:22:13,441 --> 01:22:16,171
Tamanna came to the court every day...

795
01:22:16,243 --> 01:22:18,370
...and nobody wanted to
even touch her case.

796
01:22:18,446 --> 01:22:20,676
She was determined to
fight by herself.

797
01:22:22,349 --> 01:22:23,782
When I saw her determination...

798
01:22:23,851 --> 01:22:26,342
...it made me realize this is
why I became a lawyer.

799
01:22:26,420 --> 01:22:29,184
If I can't help people like Tamanna
Sahni then what's the point?

800
01:22:29,256 --> 01:22:30,780
If you feel so strongly about it...

801
01:22:30,858 --> 01:22:34,521
Why did you refuse to accept
the case in the first place?

802
01:22:37,364 --> 01:22:39,696
Sir, she's HIV positive and I...

803
01:22:40,267 --> 01:22:43,794
Were you scared you'd catch
the infection from her?

804
01:22:43,871 --> 01:22:46,704
In which case, you shouldn't be
sitting with me in this car either.

805
01:22:46,807 --> 01:22:49,867
I had a client who
was an HIV patient.

806
01:22:49,944 --> 01:22:51,434
I used to shake hands
with her and also...

807
01:22:51,512 --> 01:22:53,605
Sir, please. I'm sorry.

808
01:22:53,681 --> 01:22:56,946
Don't get serious. I'm
just pulling your leg.

809
01:22:57,384 --> 01:23:01,218
I think they are long enough, sir.
- Ok.

810
01:23:01,455 --> 01:23:10,227
Ground 1. She claims she was fired
because she's HIV-positive? - Ok.

811
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:14,833
Ground 2. She says she still
is competent enough to work.

812
01:23:14,902 --> 01:23:16,392
Precisely.
- Right.

813
01:23:16,470 --> 01:23:19,303
Her job profile.
- Sir she is...

814
01:23:20,307 --> 01:23:22,832
Sir, she was one of the high
salaried persons in he company.

815
01:23:22,910 --> 01:23:24,844
Creative head of the company.

816
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:28,748
She also shared profits from
whatever accounts she handled.

817
01:23:29,416 --> 01:23:33,250
In that case she can't Tj
associates to court. No.

818
01:23:33,487 --> 01:23:36,581
What?! Why not?

819
01:23:38,425 --> 01:23:42,259
There's no law in India which
entitles an employee to file a suit...

820
01:23:42,329 --> 01:23:47,926
...against the employer, for
termination of services.

821
01:23:48,602 --> 01:23:52,265
They've also cleared your dues.
- It isn't about my dues.

822
01:23:52,339 --> 01:23:55,274
It's about wrongfully removing
me from my service.

823
01:23:55,342 --> 01:23:58,277
Unfortunately, the Indian law
does not consider it wrongful.

824
01:23:58,345 --> 01:24:00,336
It's different in America and Europe...

825
01:24:00,414 --> 01:24:02,405
They have a number of laws
to prevent discrimination...

826
01:24:02,483 --> 01:24:04,883
...against HIV and AIDS cases.

827
01:24:04,952 --> 01:24:08,683
But I came across this policy
on the internet, sir.

828
01:24:08,756 --> 01:24:11,884
The government's national AIDS
prevention and control policy...

829
01:24:11,959 --> 01:24:15,451
It's just a policy. It doesn't
even have legal sanction.

830
01:24:20,568 --> 01:24:24,299
There is a way out. Judges
have the power...

831
01:24:24,371 --> 01:24:28,307
...to take up a case that cannot
be filed under any written law.

832
01:24:28,375 --> 01:24:31,833
That's only if they feel
that the case is worthy...

833
01:24:31,912 --> 01:24:33,846
...of being heard in court.
Otherwise...

834
01:24:34,648 --> 01:24:38,311
That's the only way out.
- I'm glad it's the only way.

835
01:24:38,385 --> 01:24:41,479
Else, it'd have created confusion
over which course to take.

836
01:24:44,592 --> 01:24:47,322
There's another thing, Tamanna. When
this case is taken up in court...

837
01:24:47,394 --> 01:24:49,487
...if it all it is taken up...

838
01:24:49,563 --> 01:24:52,999
Tj's lawyers are likely to ask
you all sort of questions.

839
01:24:56,403 --> 01:25:02,069
About your personal life. Questions
you will have to answer.

840
01:25:02,409 --> 01:25:06,004
So give it another thought.
You've to be prepared for it.

841
01:25:07,514 --> 01:25:12,349
A day after Subbu fired me, there was
an article in the Economic Times.

842
01:25:13,020 --> 01:25:16,854
Subbu gave all the credit for the
work I had put in for BSA's account...

843
01:25:16,924 --> 01:25:20,018
...to the new creative director.

844
01:25:21,428 --> 01:25:24,363
And you say they are likely to
ask me about my personal life?

845
01:25:25,432 --> 01:25:29,368
A personal life in which
I stayed up all nights...

846
01:25:29,436 --> 01:25:32,098
...to complete my official work
at home. No friends circle.

847
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:38,044
Because of which I had
no social life

848
01:25:39,446 --> 01:25:43,382
In fact, I couldn't share
little joys with Tania...

849
01:25:43,450 --> 01:25:46,715
...in which she missed me the most.

850
01:25:48,555 --> 01:25:52,389
Why did I put in such a lot of hard
work and make so many sacrifices?

851
01:25:52,559 --> 01:25:56,586
It was for myself. Because
it meant the life to me.

852
01:25:57,464 --> 01:26:03,061
My professional life was my personal
life. That was my only life.

853
01:26:05,472 --> 01:26:07,406
I have a question for you, Mr Lal?

854
01:26:07,474 --> 01:26:12,411
What would you do if someone tried
to snatch your very life from you?

855
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:38,096
The anger that is pent up in you,
will prove useful in court.

856
01:26:38,672 --> 01:26:41,106
Provided it's still there.

857
01:26:49,783 --> 01:26:51,774
Have a coffee.

858
01:27:48,175 --> 01:27:52,839
Do we have a new supplier of milk?
- Shut up. It was lying on the floor

859
01:27:52,913 --> 01:27:55,507
Thanks. Come in.

860
01:27:59,586 --> 01:28:03,920
Lal Sir had called. Those
are my bank statements...

861
01:28:03,991 --> 01:28:10,260
...they account for all the
remuneration I received.

862
01:28:15,602 --> 01:28:17,695
Lal Sir was right here.

863
01:28:17,771 --> 01:28:20,535
He left this morning. He's
got to go to the college.

864
01:28:20,707 --> 01:28:24,541
Was Lal Sir here all night?

865
01:28:26,814 --> 01:28:28,873
To help you out?

866
01:28:33,620 --> 01:28:37,556
When Subbu Sir and I started
Tj Associates...

867
01:28:37,624 --> 01:28:42,561
...we too used to work through
the nights like this.

868
01:28:44,631 --> 01:28:49,227
There were just the two of us,
a peon and a flask of coffee.

869
01:28:51,638 --> 01:28:55,233
Most of the time, Subbu Sir
himself made the photocopies.

870
01:28:56,910 --> 01:28:59,242
We used to have a secondhand
machine then.

871
01:29:00,647 --> 01:29:02,911
I wonder where he got it from

872
01:29:03,650 --> 01:29:11,750
His hands used to be black with
the machine's ink, every evening.

873
01:29:12,659 --> 01:29:14,650
You know.

874
01:29:30,677 --> 01:29:35,944
Hi, Kalyani. Sorry to
keep you waiting.

875
01:29:37,117 --> 01:29:40,609
You better be Tj. I've got
to get to the court.

876
01:29:41,688 --> 01:29:44,350
Tea, coffee...? Anything
for you, Kalyani?

877
01:29:47,861 --> 01:29:50,625
I got to be at the court, Tj.

878
01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:15,313
A legal notice from Tamanna's
lawyers this morning.

879
01:30:17,724 --> 01:30:19,817
Wrong termination of services.

880
01:30:19,893 --> 01:30:27,061
It says that we fired Tamanna
because she's suffering from AIDS.

881
01:30:27,134 --> 01:30:29,659
That it wasn't because
of her incompetence.

882
01:30:30,904 --> 01:30:37,673
Tj, you had no idea that Tamanna was
HIV positive. You just did not know.

883
01:30:37,744 --> 01:30:41,680
Remember that. Till you
received this notice...

884
01:30:41,748 --> 01:30:45,184
...you did not know that
Tamanna was HIV positive.

885
01:30:50,857 --> 01:30:53,758
Make it clear to the rest
of your staff too.

886
01:30:53,827 --> 01:30:58,855
None of them are supposed to
know of Tamanna's illness.

887
01:31:03,870 --> 01:31:10,434
Kalyani, this company is my life.

888
01:31:16,783 --> 01:31:19,115
I want to know about
her personal life.

889
01:31:19,186 --> 01:31:24,886
Every little detail. However minor.

890
01:31:43,039 --> 01:31:44,973
Nervous?

891
01:31:49,045 --> 01:31:51,036
Me too.

892
01:31:58,054 --> 01:31:59,988
Hello.

893
01:32:22,078 --> 01:32:24,410
You are looking fine.

894
01:32:30,286 --> 01:32:34,017
Hello, Kalyani. - Hello.
Congratulations on the new book.

895
01:32:34,090 --> 01:32:37,423
Thank you reading it. Hello, Mr. Tj.

896
01:32:37,494 --> 01:32:39,018
Thank you.

897
01:32:41,197 --> 01:32:44,360
Today, I hope to settle the
matter among ourselves.

898
01:32:45,101 --> 01:32:47,695
The plaintive and the defendant
can discuss this personally...

899
01:32:47,771 --> 01:32:49,033
...with me if they want to...

900
01:32:49,105 --> 01:32:54,634
...without their attorneys.
- I don't mind. - Me too.

901
01:32:56,112 --> 01:32:58,103
And you.

902
01:33:07,123 --> 01:33:10,456
Mr Subramanian, she wants her job
back. What do you have to say?

903
01:33:10,527 --> 01:33:13,052
That's not possible, sir.

904
01:33:13,296 --> 01:33:15,560
Tamanna, he doesn't want
you back on the job.

905
01:33:15,632 --> 01:33:19,728
However, sir... I'm willing to pay
Tamanna half a million rupees.

906
01:33:19,803 --> 01:33:23,671
We have cleared her settlement
dues. Even then...

907
01:33:23,740 --> 01:33:26,072
I don't want his money. I want my job

908
01:33:26,142 --> 01:33:30,078
And also a letter stating that
my termination was a mistake...

909
01:33:30,146 --> 01:33:32,478
...and that I'm competent to work.

910
01:33:34,250 --> 01:33:37,742
I'm sorry, Tamanna. I
cannot speak this lie.

911
01:33:38,154 --> 01:33:44,423
You were negligent in your duties.
You didn't do your job properly.

912
01:33:45,361 --> 01:33:50,094
In that case, you could say
that in court. Under oath.

913
01:33:50,166 --> 01:33:52,430
I'd like to see that too.

914
01:33:57,373 --> 01:34:03,710
Cases.
- AC Versus Union of India.

915
01:34:03,780 --> 01:34:06,510
X versus hospital ruled
by supreme court.

916
01:34:06,583 --> 01:34:09,450
Good!
- I had a good teacher.

917
01:34:13,189 --> 01:34:18,456
Dr. Rai Singh. MBBS from All India
Institute of medical sciences in 1986.

918
01:34:21,297 --> 01:34:23,857
Can I see the list of witnesses?
- Right, sir.

919
01:34:26,202 --> 01:34:28,295
Excuse me.
- What happened?

920
01:34:28,371 --> 01:34:31,738
Must be Nisha. The poor girl
must be waiting somewhere.

921
01:34:31,808 --> 01:34:34,641
He must've called her over for
lunch and forgotten about it

922
01:34:39,482 --> 01:34:41,814
What happened, Tarun?
- Sorry, sir...

923
01:34:42,218 --> 01:34:45,312
I had to meet Nisha over lunch
and forgot about it.

924
01:34:48,424 --> 01:34:51,325
You find it funny? And I'm suffering!

925
01:34:51,394 --> 01:34:52,759
She doesn't want to see
me again. I'm dead.

926
01:34:52,829 --> 01:34:55,764
I don't blame her. Do you?
- Neither do I?

927
01:34:55,832 --> 01:34:58,164
In her shoes, I'd have
done the same thing.

928
01:34:58,234 --> 01:35:01,670
If you were in her shoes, what
should I have done then?

929
01:35:02,505 --> 01:35:06,168
A dozen long-stemmed roses,
candle-light dinner and maybe...

930
01:35:06,242 --> 01:35:08,506
And...? Is there more to come?
- Of course.

931
01:35:08,578 --> 01:35:11,570
You'd have had to go down on your
knees and beg for forgiveness.

932
01:35:11,648 --> 01:35:14,344
Ok, guys. Let's get back to work.

933
01:35:14,417 --> 01:35:17,181
Correct, sir. Let me see
the list of witnesses.

934
01:35:19,522 --> 01:35:23,185
Tamanna, this is the list of people
Kalyani will present in court...

935
01:35:23,259 --> 01:35:26,194
...as Tj's witnesses.

936
01:35:26,262 --> 01:35:29,197
Tell us whatever you know about them...

937
01:35:29,265 --> 01:35:31,529
...especially the sort of rapport
you shared with them

938
01:35:31,601 --> 01:35:32,795
Prashant Mathur...

939
01:35:34,270 --> 01:35:36,795
Did you get it?
- I've been waiting for you, Tarun!

940
01:35:36,873 --> 01:35:40,536
Did you get the adjournment?
- Yes, here you are.

941
01:35:40,810 --> 01:35:44,940
For me...? They're so
beautiful. Thanks

942
01:35:46,482 --> 01:35:50,714
Got to give some to Nisha too.
- Any dearth of roses in Bangalore?

943
01:35:51,287 --> 01:35:54,222
No... dearth of money actually.

944
01:35:56,392 --> 01:35:59,884
On our way, let's stop
at a sports shop.

945
01:36:00,396 --> 01:36:03,729
A sports shop?
- Yes. To buy some knee caps.

946
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:05,893
So your knees won't hurt.

947
01:36:06,302 --> 01:36:09,829
All the best.
- Yeah. Very funny. Bye.

948
01:36:10,306 --> 01:36:12,501
Do you have a car?
- Yes.

949
01:36:12,575 --> 01:36:14,839
Can I borrow it? My car broke down

950
01:36:14,911 --> 01:36:18,244
Tarun!
- Please. - You are shameless.

951
01:36:27,323 --> 01:36:30,258
Tarun, get up.

952
01:36:34,330 --> 01:36:36,321
Coffee.

953
01:36:36,532 --> 01:36:42,937
Don't forget, you're
up against Kalyani.

954
01:36:43,339 --> 01:36:47,275
When she was in school, she lost
her right arm in a bus accident.

955
01:36:47,343 --> 01:36:50,278
Her parents filed a
case of negligence...

956
01:36:50,346 --> 01:36:52,439
...against the bus company... and lost.

957
01:36:53,349 --> 01:36:58,013
That Kalyani is one of India's
top lawyers today.

958
01:36:58,354 --> 01:37:03,291
Why did you give Tamanna the
offer to work with you?

959
01:37:04,527 --> 01:37:07,894
Well, I thought that maybe
she had the talent and...

960
01:37:08,364 --> 01:37:12,892
No, Tj! When Tamanna's lawyer
puts this question to you...

961
01:37:12,969 --> 01:37:15,961
...answer him confidently.

962
01:37:16,572 --> 01:37:19,370
And don't speak any lies,
unless I ask you to.

963
01:37:19,642 --> 01:37:25,308
Instead say, Because Tamanna was
talented. I had seen her work

964
01:37:25,648 --> 01:37:30,483
Now... why did you give Tamanna
the offer to work with you?

965
01:37:30,553 --> 01:37:33,317
Tamanna was a talented girl and...

966
01:37:33,389 --> 01:37:37,723
If she was indeed talented, how did
she suddenly become inefficient...?

967
01:37:38,394 --> 01:37:41,830
The reason why you fired
her from the job

968
01:37:42,398 --> 01:37:46,494
When I gave her the offer, I thought
she would do her best.

969
01:37:46,569 --> 01:37:49,663
However...
- However what, Mr Subramanian?

970
01:37:49,806 --> 01:37:53,333
However for the awards Tamanna
won for your company...?

971
01:37:53,409 --> 01:37:56,936
...or is it for the clients she
brought to your company?

972
01:37:57,013 --> 01:37:59,345
Please explain this to the court.

973
01:37:59,415 --> 01:38:02,407
The awards were a result of
the company's teamwork.

974
01:38:02,518 --> 01:38:05,681
Tamanna had not worked
all alone on them.

975
01:38:06,422 --> 01:38:10,950
But you gave only Tamanna
a share of the profits...?

976
01:38:11,027 --> 01:38:13,018
Not the whole team?

977
01:38:13,763 --> 01:38:18,029
That was then. Tamanna
Used to work hard then.

978
01:38:18,434 --> 01:38:20,959
She became complacent once
we got the BSA account...

979
01:38:21,037 --> 01:38:22,698
...and her results were poor.

980
01:38:23,706 --> 01:38:27,767
Good. Maintain this tone in court.

981
01:38:30,446 --> 01:38:34,712
Kalyani, I don't want to employ
an AIDS patient in my office.

982
01:38:35,451 --> 01:38:38,443
This has nothing to do with
her health and ability.

983
01:38:39,455 --> 01:38:41,446
This is a reflection
of her character.

984
01:38:53,469 --> 01:38:58,406
Wow! Where has the sun
Risen from today?

985
01:38:58,474 --> 01:39:00,465
You're dressed up already?

986
01:39:01,577 --> 01:39:04,137
The first day of the hearing,
isn't it?

987
01:39:08,684 --> 01:39:12,586
Yogurt and sugar.
- What's all this, Tanu?

988
01:39:12,688 --> 01:39:18,092
Remember? Mom always gave it to
us before we left for our exams?

989
01:39:18,494 --> 01:39:20,485
For good luck? For all you know...

990
01:39:20,563 --> 01:39:24,932
...the Sun might rise
from the west today...

991
01:39:25,001 --> 01:39:28,437
...and return all your
happiness to you.

992
01:39:33,776 --> 01:39:35,437
Thank you.

993
01:39:48,791 --> 01:39:49,849
Thank you.

994
01:39:50,726 --> 01:39:52,455
Please introduce yourself.

995
01:39:52,528 --> 01:39:57,465
Suresh Muthana. CEO of Megan
cosmetics. - Thank you.

996
01:39:57,533 --> 01:40:01,629
In 1999, Tamanna Sahni designed
an ad campaign for your company...

997
01:40:01,704 --> 01:40:04,867
It was Tj Associates who designed
The ad campaign for us.

998
01:40:04,941 --> 01:40:08,468
And Tamanna Sahni was head of
The team? - That's right.

999
01:40:10,546 --> 01:40:12,810
What do you think of Tamanna
Sahni's designs?

1000
01:40:12,882 --> 01:40:16,818
They were okay.
- Okay...? Or were they very good?

1001
01:40:19,889 --> 01:40:23,484
They were okay.
- Mr Mutanna...

1002
01:40:23,559 --> 01:40:28,826
...when I approached you with a
request to be a witness in this case...

1003
01:40:28,898 --> 01:40:32,163
This is what you had to say
about Tamanna Sahni's work.

1004
01:40:32,568 --> 01:40:35,503
Tamanna's work was outstanding.

1005
01:40:36,572 --> 01:40:41,009
In 3 months, her work turns
okay from outstanding?

1006
01:40:41,077 --> 01:40:43,511
Objection.
- Sustained.

1007
01:40:44,747 --> 01:40:48,513
Mr Sinha, following Tamanna
Sahni's campaign...

1008
01:40:48,584 --> 01:40:50,575
...the sales of your company...

1009
01:40:50,653 --> 01:40:54,851
...had improved by 56 per cent.
As per your annual report.

1010
01:40:56,692 --> 01:41:00,184
The improvement wasn't only
because of the campaign.

1011
01:41:00,596 --> 01:41:02,530
There were many other
factors involved.

1012
01:41:02,598 --> 01:41:05,260
Ok. Thank you Mr. Sinha.
Your witness.

1013
01:41:09,705 --> 01:41:12,538
Is it true that it was
Mr Subramanian...

1014
01:41:12,608 --> 01:41:17,045
...who supervised the plan
of your campaign?

1015
01:41:17,113 --> 01:41:18,546
Yes, he didm

1016
01:41:19,148 --> 01:41:22,549
In other words, everything
Tamanna Sahni was doing...

1017
01:41:22,618 --> 01:41:25,951
...was being supervised
by Mr Tj Subramanian?

1018
01:41:26,022 --> 01:41:28,047
Right?
- Right.

1019
01:41:30,626 --> 01:41:34,562
Would it be okay to say
then that Tamanna Sahni...

1020
01:41:34,630 --> 01:41:37,565
...was merely following Mr
Tj Subramanian's orders...?

1021
01:41:37,633 --> 01:41:41,569
And that the ideas and the brains
behind the campaign...

1022
01:41:41,637 --> 01:41:45,573
...were actually Mr Tj Subramanian's?

1023
01:41:45,641 --> 01:41:49,577
I object.
- Overruled. Answer the question.

1024
01:41:51,647 --> 01:41:54,980
The campaign was indeed the result
of Mr Subramaniam's ideas...

1025
01:41:55,051 --> 01:41:57,918
...and Tamanna was merely
following orders.

1026
01:41:58,654 --> 01:42:02,750
Thank you Mr. Sinha.
- No further questions your honor.

1027
01:42:14,670 --> 01:42:16,661
Feeling better?

1028
01:42:23,679 --> 01:42:26,614
I have no more witnesses left.

1029
01:42:27,883 --> 01:42:31,341
So use the ones they have.

1030
01:42:38,694 --> 01:42:40,685
Sometimes, I feel scared.

1031
01:42:42,698 --> 01:42:48,796
Tamanna has pinned all her
hopes on this case... on me.

1032
01:42:49,705 --> 01:42:52,640
It's a good thing if it scares you.

1033
01:42:52,708 --> 01:42:54,972
You'll do your best.

1034
01:43:02,985 --> 01:43:06,978
Did you prepare the designs that were
sent for BSA's approval? - No.

1035
01:43:07,723 --> 01:43:09,657
Which means the designs
you went to present...

1036
01:43:09,725 --> 01:43:11,249
...were prepared by someone else.

1037
01:43:11,327 --> 01:43:12,817
By Tamanna.
- No, sir.

1038
01:43:12,895 --> 01:43:17,332
Our new creative director Mr Suresh
Samtani prepared the designs.

1039
01:43:19,168 --> 01:43:26,665
Mr Mathur, Mr Suresh Samtani joined
Tj Associates on june 18, 2003.

1040
01:43:26,742 --> 01:43:32,408
And these designs were approved
on May 20, 2003.

1041
01:43:34,750 --> 01:43:38,015
Here is a copy of Mr Samtani's
appointment letter.

1042
01:43:39,755 --> 01:43:41,746
That's for you.

1043
01:43:41,824 --> 01:43:44,691
Mr Subramanian had entrusted this
assignment to Mr Samtani...

1044
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:48,696
mmeven before his appointment,
because it was very important...

1045
01:43:48,764 --> 01:43:53,098
...and because Ms Tamanna Sahni wasn't
being able to handle it competently.

1046
01:43:53,169 --> 01:43:54,693
All right.

1047
01:44:03,779 --> 01:44:06,873
This is a copy of the letter
BSA sent to Tj Associates...

1048
01:44:06,949 --> 01:44:09,918
...dated May 20, 2003. The
Marketing Head states...

1049
01:44:09,985 --> 01:44:13,045
...that they had quite liked...

1050
01:44:13,122 --> 01:44:16,717
...the designs of Tamanna Sahni
that were presented to them

1051
01:44:16,792 --> 01:44:18,885
He writes...

1052
01:44:18,961 --> 01:44:22,727
We'd like to let you know that the
designs presented by Ms. Tamanna Sahni...

1053
01:44:22,798 --> 01:44:27,326
...on the 15th of May 192003 were
very good and have been approved.

1054
01:44:27,403 --> 01:44:30,463
Barring a few minor changes, which
have been stated as under.

1055
01:44:30,806 --> 01:44:34,742
Me Lord, this letter was not
shown to the defense...

1056
01:44:34,810 --> 01:44:37,745
...along with all the other evidence
presented by the plaintiff's attorney.

1057
01:44:37,813 --> 01:44:42,910
Ms. Kalyani, I think I'll allow it.
- Thank you, Me Lord.

1058
01:45:00,102 --> 01:45:07,770
Me lord, I'll like to cite the
judgement in AK single versus...

1059
01:45:07,843 --> 01:45:11,939
...B. Lal 1998 A1 HC 2287, which
rules that photocopy of document...

1060
01:45:12,014 --> 01:45:13,948
...is inadmissible as evidence.

1061
01:45:14,016 --> 01:45:17,782
Me Lord, I'll like to ask
Tj associates to the...

1062
01:45:17,853 --> 01:45:20,515
...originals from the records.

1063
01:45:24,193 --> 01:45:27,788
The next time you send documents
to me, just make sure...

1064
01:45:27,863 --> 01:45:32,129
...the one you're sending it with is
not making photocopies of them!

1065
01:45:32,868 --> 01:45:35,132
I just can't believe this at all.

1066
01:45:38,874 --> 01:45:42,310
Were you the one who gave Tarun
a photocopy of that letter?

1067
01:45:42,878 --> 01:45:45,142
I have a letter for you, too.

1068
01:45:47,883 --> 01:45:49,874
My resignation.

1069
01:45:52,988 --> 01:45:55,047
I hope you're coming, Sameer?

1070
01:46:00,229 --> 01:46:04,165
I'm sorry, I can't come today.
- What do you mean...?

1071
01:46:04,233 --> 01:46:08,829
Today is Tammy's birthday.
- I'm sorry, Tania...

1072
01:46:08,904 --> 01:46:13,102
Actually, Sonali and I are
planning to have a baby.

1073
01:46:13,909 --> 01:46:18,846
And... I think I'd better stay away
from any kind of infection.

1074
01:46:18,914 --> 01:46:22,247
Please understand and convey
my wishes to Tam.

1075
01:46:36,098 --> 01:46:39,124
Want me to serve dinner?
- Let's wait for Sam.

1076
01:46:39,201 --> 01:46:41,863
I don't think he's coming.
- When I called, he said...

1077
01:46:41,937 --> 01:46:45,873
...he'll call back in two minutes.
- And it's 3 hours already.

1078
01:46:45,941 --> 01:46:49,035
Let's wait a little while more.
- I know for sure, he's not coming.

1079
01:46:49,111 --> 01:46:52,547
He's afraid he might contract AIDS
if he comes close to Tammy!

1080
01:47:00,055 --> 01:47:01,215
I'll get that.

1081
01:47:09,231 --> 01:47:11,392
Hi.
- Hi.

1082
01:47:12,968 --> 01:47:16,563
Happy Birthday.
- Thank you.

1083
01:47:16,972 --> 01:47:19,907
How did you get to know? - You
didn't tell me, but I get to know.

1084
01:47:19,975 --> 01:47:22,307
I'm your lawyer after
all. It's my job.

1085
01:47:22,978 --> 01:47:24,912
Rosy's here too.

1086
01:47:24,980 --> 01:47:26,971
Hi Rosy
- Hi. - Hi Baby.

1087
01:47:27,049 --> 01:47:30,644
This is Goody. - Hi, How are you.
- Good. - Nice to meet you.

1088
01:47:32,988 --> 01:47:34,512
I believe you've just started
your fiftieth job.

1089
01:47:34,590 --> 01:47:36,922
Congratulations! How about
a golden jubilee?

1090
01:47:36,992 --> 01:47:39,927
Rosy, do I have to pay
you a commission for...

1091
01:47:39,995 --> 01:47:41,929
...getting me Tamanna's case?

1092
01:47:41,997 --> 01:47:44,932
Just win the case for Tam.
You could call that my commission.

1093
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:46,592
She'll win the case, all right.

1094
01:47:46,669 --> 01:47:51,197
She's so used to it. No wonder
she has all those awards.

1095
01:47:51,273 --> 01:47:55,334
But there's a problem with me.
When it comes to victory, I...

1096
01:47:55,444 --> 01:47:57,935
Whether you win it or I, it's
one and the same thing.

1097
01:47:58,013 --> 01:48:02,541
That's very much like him, Tam. To
keep throwing words back and forth.

1098
01:48:02,618 --> 01:48:04,347
Without making any sense.
- That's great!

1099
01:48:04,420 --> 01:48:06,547
Which means I have the makings
of a successful lawyer. Good!

1100
01:48:06,622 --> 01:48:08,954
There's still a hope. I'm
very happy. Very good.

1101
01:48:15,297 --> 01:48:18,460
At eleven tomorrow?
- Yes.

1102
01:48:26,141 --> 01:48:28,974
When I was about to appear
for my first case...

1103
01:48:29,044 --> 01:48:31,478
...and called on Mr Satsangi
first, he asked me...

1104
01:48:31,547 --> 01:48:36,143
How is your preparation? I said,
I've done my best sir

1105
01:48:37,052 --> 01:48:41,489
He said, The client pays
you not to do your best...

1106
01:48:41,557 --> 01:48:44,492
...he pays you to win the case

1107
01:48:47,062 --> 01:48:53,661
I guess what I wanna say is that I've
done my best in this case so far.

1108
01:48:55,070 --> 01:48:56,332
Only my best.

1109
01:48:58,073 --> 01:49:02,407
I haven't been able to present the
case as effectively as I expected to.

1110
01:49:04,079 --> 01:49:06,343
You know what, Tarun.

1111
01:49:07,082 --> 01:49:12,179
I only asked you to stand by me in
my fight. And you're doing that

1112
01:49:12,254 --> 01:49:15,746
I don't expect or hope for
anything more than that.

1113
01:49:18,093 --> 01:49:22,189
I will speak the truth and
nothing but the truth.

1114
01:49:25,200 --> 01:49:29,102
Had you informed Mr Tj Subramanian
about your absence?

1115
01:49:29,171 --> 01:49:34,438
I did. For a week, I couldn't
overcome the shock.

1116
01:49:35,277 --> 01:49:39,714
Subbu Sir made several calls,
but I didn't take them.

1117
01:49:41,116 --> 01:49:45,553
And finally, he came to
my house. To meet me.

1118
01:49:49,324 --> 01:49:51,724
To begin with, he couldn't
understand anything.

1119
01:49:55,130 --> 01:49:59,396
I then told him about my HIV report.

1120
01:50:08,577 --> 01:50:11,137
Why did you tell Mr Subramanian?

1121
01:50:11,213 --> 01:50:15,411
Why did you have to tell something
personal to anyone at the office?

1122
01:50:15,584 --> 01:50:19,076
Subbu Sir wasn't just
my boss or my employer.

1123
01:50:20,255 --> 01:50:24,419
In the last nine years, ever
since I have known him...

1124
01:50:24,493 --> 01:50:28,429
...he has stood by me through
every hardship of mine.

1125
01:50:29,164 --> 01:50:35,763
In a manner that perhaps my parents
would have stood by me...

1126
01:50:38,173 --> 01:50:40,767
...had they been alive today.

1127
01:50:42,177 --> 01:50:46,273
Subbu Sir made up for
the lack of my parents.

1128
01:50:47,382 --> 01:50:52,445
He was like a father figure
to me. He was my hero.

1129
01:50:55,190 --> 01:50:57,181
Your witness.

1130
01:51:04,366 --> 01:51:08,132
When did you start working
for Tj Associates?

1131
01:51:09,204 --> 01:51:11,195
In 1997.

1132
01:51:13,475 --> 01:51:19,471
Subbu Sir and I used to
work for HTA before that.

1133
01:51:20,315 --> 01:51:29,485
When Subbu Sir decided to quit HTA
he asked me join him and I did.

1134
01:51:30,225 --> 01:51:34,662
Was Mr Tj Subramanian offering
you a higher salary than HTA?

1135
01:51:34,730 --> 01:51:36,163
There wasn't anything of the sort.

1136
01:51:36,231 --> 01:51:40,167
The two of us took the decision born
out of creative independence.

1137
01:51:40,235 --> 01:51:43,432
I knew, my income wouldn't
be much initially.

1138
01:51:43,505 --> 01:51:47,566
But you took the risk?
- It was worth taking the risk.

1139
01:51:47,643 --> 01:51:50,441
Of course, it was worth
taking the risk.

1140
01:51:50,512 --> 01:51:56,849
In just 3 years, Tj Associates got
big accounts like BSA and TSM.

1141
01:52:00,522 --> 01:52:05,186
You said that you quit HTA
for creative independence.

1142
01:52:07,262 --> 01:52:10,197
Did Mr Subramanian ever attempt...

1143
01:52:10,265 --> 01:52:15,862
...to override or suppress your
creative independence...?

1144
01:52:15,938 --> 01:52:18,930
...in these seven years?
- No.

1145
01:52:19,541 --> 01:52:25,275
In other words, Mr Tj Subramanian
kept the promise he had made to you?

1146
01:52:25,447 --> 01:52:27,540
Yes.
- Last year...

1147
01:52:27,616 --> 01:52:31,211
...in the middle of a huge
campaign for BSA...

1148
01:52:31,286 --> 01:52:37,555
...you suddenly told Mr Subramanian
that you wanted leave.

1149
01:52:37,626 --> 01:52:40,390
Did he turn down your request?
- No.

1150
01:52:40,462 --> 01:52:42,623
What did you seek the leave for?

1151
01:52:42,698 --> 01:52:46,395
Objection, Me Lord. Irrelevant.
- Sustained.

1152
01:52:46,501 --> 01:52:49,834
What was more important than
the BSA campaign, Tamanna?

1153
01:52:49,905 --> 01:52:51,236
Objection, Me Lord. - Ms. Kalyani.

1154
01:52:51,306 --> 01:52:54,901
Please stick to the questions
pertaining to the case.

1155
01:52:59,414 --> 01:53:02,975
How did you contract the
HIV infection, Tamanna?

1156
01:53:09,524 --> 01:53:15,986
Tamanna... answer me. How did
you get the HIV infection?

1157
01:53:28,343 --> 01:53:32,336
How did you get the HIV infection?

1158
01:53:49,631 --> 01:53:51,292
Rohit...?

1159
01:53:58,373 --> 01:54:03,310
Didn't you ever ask him why
he had done this to you?

1160
01:54:03,478 --> 01:54:07,471
Why didn't he tell you that
he was HIV-positive?

1161
01:54:09,384 --> 01:54:11,648
I couldn't establish contact
with him again.

1162
01:54:14,556 --> 01:54:18,993
That's really sad. That's
really terrible.

1163
01:54:19,394 --> 01:54:26,323
How could anyone be such a scoundrel,
so sadistic, so selfish...

1164
01:54:28,403 --> 01:54:31,065
Weren't you angry with Rohit?

1165
01:54:36,411 --> 01:54:43,010
Tamanna...?
- I was. I was very angry.

1166
01:54:45,420 --> 01:54:46,682
Very angry.

1167
01:54:46,755 --> 01:54:51,852
And you're now bringing out the
same anger against Tj Associates?

1168
01:54:51,927 --> 01:54:54,361
Your anger against Rohit?

1169
01:54:59,634 --> 01:55:03,365
Finally, it wasn't worth
taking the risk, was it?

1170
01:55:22,457 --> 01:55:25,392
Mr Subramanian, why did
you make Tamanna Sahni...

1171
01:55:25,460 --> 01:55:27,394
...an offer to work with you?

1172
01:55:27,462 --> 01:55:31,398
Tamanna was a talented girl.
I had seen her work.

1173
01:55:31,566 --> 01:55:35,900
You also gave her a share in the
profits of your company. Right?

1174
01:55:35,971 --> 01:55:37,404
From the profits I made from clients...

1175
01:55:37,472 --> 01:55:39,463
...who were impressed
with Tamanna's work...

1176
01:55:39,541 --> 01:55:42,999
I paid Tamanna 20 per
cent of the profits.

1177
01:55:43,578 --> 01:55:47,912
Which means you had made no mistake
by making Tamanna Sahni an offer...

1178
01:55:47,983 --> 01:55:52,420
...to work with you? - Certainly
not. I was proud of her work.

1179
01:55:52,487 --> 01:55:55,479
But then, Tamanna turned
over-confident.

1180
01:55:55,557 --> 01:55:58,492
If she wished, she could have
been far more successful.

1181
01:55:58,560 --> 01:56:02,826
But her indiscipline had started
having an effect on her work.

1182
01:56:02,931 --> 01:56:04,831
What makes you say that?

1183
01:56:05,500 --> 01:56:07,491
Her work started getting delayed.

1184
01:56:07,569 --> 01:56:10,766
She was paying more attention
to her personal life.

1185
01:56:16,711 --> 01:56:22,445
Mr Subramanian, can you place
a hand on your heart and say...

1186
01:56:22,517 --> 01:56:30,117
...that you fired Tamanna Sahni only
because she wasn't efficient enough?

1187
01:56:30,625 --> 01:56:35,460
That there was no other reason?
- Objection! - Sustained.

1188
01:56:35,797 --> 01:56:44,205
Please. For a moment, put yourself
in Tamanna's shoes and tell me...

1189
01:56:45,540 --> 01:56:48,873
...was what you did, right?

1190
01:56:48,944 --> 01:56:51,538
Objection Me Lord.
- No, I'll take that.

1191
01:56:51,613 --> 01:56:54,081
I'd like to answer this question.

1192
01:56:54,149 --> 01:56:57,482
Had Tamanna been in my
shoes and I in hers...

1193
01:56:57,552 --> 01:57:01,488
I'd have been glad if Tamanna did
what I have eventually done.

1194
01:57:02,824 --> 01:57:05,156
This is a company of my dreams.

1195
01:57:06,561 --> 01:57:11,225
And whatever I have done, I
have done for the company.

1196
01:58:18,900 --> 01:58:22,734
Excuse me. Rohit Manchanda...?

1197
01:59:29,804 --> 01:59:37,233
I didn't know. I had no idea...
I was HIV positive.

1198
01:59:38,713 --> 01:59:40,704
I didn't know...

1199
01:59:40,782 --> 01:59:42,807
I'm sorry.

1200
02:01:34,028 --> 02:01:36,826
I know how hurt you are.

1201
02:01:37,832 --> 02:01:40,767
But things like this keep
happening in court cases.

1202
02:01:46,841 --> 02:01:49,435
We've lost in the civil court.

1203
02:01:49,844 --> 02:01:52,506
But we can file an appeal
in the High Court.

1204
02:01:52,947 --> 02:01:55,438
I don't want to file an appeal.

1205
02:02:01,122 --> 02:02:09,052
If you wish to find another lawyer,
I can understand...

1206
02:02:09,130 --> 02:02:11,121
I haven't been able to
win the case for you.

1207
02:02:15,470 --> 02:02:17,199
Rohit is back.

1208
02:02:29,884 --> 02:02:31,875
He's in the last stage.

1209
02:02:39,894 --> 02:02:42,488
Did he say where he
was all these days?

1210
02:02:44,065 --> 02:02:51,494
When he was here last, he didn't
know he was HIV-positive.

1211
02:02:53,041 --> 02:02:58,343
After his return, his health started
deteriorating suddenly.

1212
02:03:00,849 --> 02:03:06,845
When the doctors conducted a check,
they found that the AIDS virus...

1213
02:03:07,355 --> 02:03:10,449
...had begun to spread in his body.

1214
02:03:13,027 --> 02:03:15,860
He spent a few months in hospital...

1215
02:03:17,932 --> 02:03:23,871
But when he got to know that his
life could end any moment...

1216
02:03:26,875 --> 02:03:28,365
...he returned...

1217
02:03:30,945 --> 02:03:34,381
...hoping against hope that
nothing had happened to me.

1218
02:03:38,887 --> 02:03:41,879
But when Niharika told him about me...

1219
02:03:43,391 --> 02:03:45,621
...he was shattered.

1220
02:03:52,967 --> 02:03:56,903
When I looked at him today,
it occurred to me...

1221
02:03:58,239 --> 02:04:01,231
...that no matter how much I fight...

1222
02:04:02,577 --> 02:04:07,913
...l'm going to be in the same
state that he's in today.

1223
02:04:14,989 --> 02:04:16,980
I'm very scared, Tarun

1224
02:04:21,596 --> 02:04:26,090
I couldn't bear to see Rohit's state.

1225
02:04:28,603 --> 02:04:31,265
I couldn't...

1226
02:04:37,211 --> 02:04:40,942
When I look at him,
I get the feeling...

1227
02:04:41,015 --> 02:04:46,612
...that I will soon be in the
same condition as he is...

1228
02:05:12,480 --> 02:05:13,970
I'm scared.

1229
02:05:19,220 --> 02:05:21,313
I don't want to fight anymore.

1230
02:05:23,391 --> 02:05:25,655
It's no good.

1231
02:05:30,264 --> 02:05:38,729
Whatever's left of life, let
me make the best of it.

1232
02:05:56,691 --> 02:05:58,522
I'm not into baby-sitting.

1233
02:06:00,094 --> 02:06:04,030
If you've come to cry
after losing the case...

1234
02:06:04,632 --> 02:06:07,032
...l'm sorry, please go away.

1235
02:06:07,635 --> 02:06:12,538
Sir, please. I've lost the case.

1236
02:06:16,110 --> 02:06:18,704
Has the case lost you, Tarun?

1237
02:06:26,320 --> 02:06:29,721
You still have the option of
appealing in the High Court

1238
02:06:30,124 --> 02:06:34,220
The judge didn't hold Tamanna
inefficient, did he?

1239
02:06:34,295 --> 02:06:38,664
His order clearly says that
Tamanna was not inefficient...

1240
02:06:38,733 --> 02:06:42,464
...and that Tj knew the fact
that she was HIV-positive.

1241
02:06:48,142 --> 02:06:51,805
You have proved what
you had to, Tarun.

1242
02:06:54,148 --> 02:06:57,083
But the judge has also said
that despite all this...

1243
02:06:57,151 --> 02:07:00,746
...Tj has the right to
throw Tamanna out

1244
02:07:01,622 --> 02:07:03,249
If Tj hasn't done anything illegal...

1245
02:07:03,324 --> 02:07:05,258
...Tamanna can't even
claim a compensation.

1246
02:07:05,326 --> 02:07:07,760
Nor can she return to her job.

1247
02:07:09,163 --> 02:07:12,098
It hasn't to do with
Tamanna alone, Tarun.

1248
02:07:12,166 --> 02:07:16,102
It has to do with many
people like Tamanna...

1249
02:07:16,170 --> 02:07:19,435
...for whose help there is just
no law in this country.

1250
02:07:21,175 --> 02:07:25,111
Here's your chance to do something
for such people.

1251
02:07:26,180 --> 02:07:28,171
And you...?

1252
02:08:07,421 --> 02:08:11,755
'Those few moments my eyes cherish...

1253
02:08:11,826 --> 02:08:16,160
Those few moments that agonise me...

1254
02:08:26,340 --> 02:08:31,175
...with a broken dream...

1255
02:08:31,245 --> 02:08:35,773
...as we fade away...

1256
02:08:44,592 --> 02:08:49,689
...these moments, that turn away...

1257
02:09:18,559 --> 02:09:23,895
Go, Tamanna. Why spend
all your time here?

1258
02:09:25,299 --> 02:09:29,565
I'm happy. To be with you.

1259
02:09:31,305 --> 02:09:33,296
Rubbish!

1260
02:09:34,308 --> 02:09:36,572
Don't die with me Tamanna.

1261
02:09:37,311 --> 02:09:41,247
For as long as you live, you live.

1262
02:09:43,317 --> 02:09:46,252
And who could know that
better than me?

1263
02:10:01,335 --> 02:10:03,326
Hello.
- Tamanna?

1264
02:10:09,343 --> 02:10:11,777
Lal Sir, Tarun here.
- Yes, Tarun?

1265
02:10:12,346 --> 02:10:15,747
A hearing of Tamanna's case is
coming up in the High Court today.

1266
02:10:15,883 --> 02:10:18,283
I'm speaking from
the hospital, Tamanna.

1267
02:10:18,352 --> 02:10:20,286
Rohit's condition has worsened.

1268
02:10:20,354 --> 02:10:21,946
I'm coming.

1269
02:10:23,524 --> 02:10:26,823
Give me a call after the hearing
and tell me how it went.

1270
02:10:27,361 --> 02:10:31,297
Sure.
- I'll wait for your call.

1271
02:10:32,366 --> 02:10:34,357
All right, sir.

1272
02:10:54,488 --> 02:10:58,652
All the best.
- Thank you.

1273
02:12:36,490 --> 02:12:38,481
You're leaving me...?

1274
02:12:46,767 --> 02:12:48,428
No...

1275
02:13:00,514 --> 02:13:01,947
Honorable judges!

1276
02:13:02,016 --> 02:13:06,612
The only identity Tamanna Sahni has
today is that of being HIV positive.

1277
02:13:07,721 --> 02:13:10,451
And this identity, we have given her...

1278
02:13:10,524 --> 02:13:14,620
...by snatching from her the
image she was known for.

1279
02:13:15,529 --> 02:13:19,056
Hers was the image of a dedicated
and sincere girl...

1280
02:13:19,133 --> 02:13:22,864
. who worked through the
days and the nights.

1281
02:13:23,804 --> 02:13:28,138
A girl who won several prestigious
awards in advertisement.

1282
02:13:30,544 --> 02:13:33,479
And what did her boss do as
soon as he got to know...

1283
02:13:33,547 --> 02:13:35,481
...that she was HIV positive?

1284
02:13:37,551 --> 02:13:39,542
He did what most people do.

1285
02:13:41,555 --> 02:13:47,152
He tried to keep Tamanna as far away
from himself as was possible.

1286
02:13:48,562 --> 02:13:52,896
And why not...? That's exactly
what I did to Tamanna too.

1287
02:13:53,701 --> 02:13:58,161
Why? Because I was scared.

1288
02:13:59,840 --> 02:14:04,504
I was scared because I was ignorant.

1289
02:14:07,781 --> 02:14:11,512
HIV is dangerous, HIV can be deadly...

1290
02:14:11,585 --> 02:14:18,013
...but can it take away your life?
Can it take away the right to live?

1291
02:14:18,092 --> 02:14:21,858
If it does, why do we even talk
about non-discrimination?

1292
02:14:23,764 --> 02:14:31,535
But if HIV is only deadly, if it does
not take away the right to live...

1293
02:14:33,207 --> 02:14:37,871
...why do we want to distance people
like Tamanna Sahni from ourselves?

1294
02:14:50,624 --> 02:14:54,219
My client Tamanna Sahni
is HIV positive.

1295
02:14:56,096 --> 02:15:00,226
And she knows that perhaps she will
not be able to survive this disease.

1296
02:15:01,735 --> 02:15:06,570
But she wants to fight.
She wants to live.

1297
02:15:06,807 --> 02:15:12,575
So why are we stopping her? What
right do we have to stop her?

1298
02:15:14,748 --> 02:15:16,909
Her condition doesn't stop her
from carrying out her duties...

1299
02:15:16,984 --> 02:15:18,076
...to the best of her abilities.

1300
02:15:18,152 --> 02:15:21,087
And may I add that she's
extremely capable.

1301
02:15:22,823 --> 02:15:26,088
We don't fire someone who
falls sick in our office...

1302
02:15:26,160 --> 02:15:28,594
...so why single out an
HIV positive patient?

1303
02:15:30,664 --> 02:15:33,258
We ought to accept them.

1304
02:15:33,867 --> 02:15:37,098
We mustn't make them feel
scared and ostracized.

1305
02:15:38,672 --> 02:15:41,004
Why can't we let them be with us?

1306
02:15:41,075 --> 02:15:43,100
Why can't we give them
love and respect?

1307
02:15:43,777 --> 02:15:45,608
Because unless we do that...

1308
02:15:45,679 --> 02:15:49,945
...they will be scared, and they
will hide from society.

1309
02:15:50,017 --> 02:15:57,116
They will conceal their ailment.
And HIV will continue to spread.

1310
02:16:04,698 --> 02:16:10,136
Tamanna Sahni is my friend. And
I'm extremely proud of her.

1311
02:16:10,204 --> 02:16:12,968
I'll stand by her come what may.

1312
02:16:13,807 --> 02:16:19,712
Today, I besiege you, the lawmakers
of this land to do the same.

1313
02:16:20,714 --> 02:16:24,650
Stand by Tamanna. Help
her get back her life.

1314
02:16:25,052 --> 02:16:29,148
Because by doing so you not only
help her but millions of people.

1315
02:16:29,223 --> 02:16:31,157
...infected by this disease.

1316
02:16:33,994 --> 02:16:41,162
And you help those very few thousands
who fight everyday also very hard...

1317
02:16:41,335 --> 02:16:44,827
...in order to stop this
spread of this virus.

1318
02:18:15,095 --> 02:18:17,757
When the clouds gather...

1319
02:18:17,831 --> 02:18:22,768
...it appears as if there's
darkness everywhere.

1320
02:18:23,937 --> 02:18:27,771
But then, a gust of wind
makes a beginning...

1321
02:18:27,841 --> 02:18:32,938
...and blows a speck
of the clouds away.

1322
02:18:33,013 --> 02:18:37,780
You begin to get a glimpse
of the blue sky again...

1323
02:18:37,851 --> 02:18:42,288
...and gradually, the skies are clear.

1324
02:19:03,877 --> 02:19:05,811
Hi!

1325
02:19:09,316 --> 02:19:12,410
Oh God! Oh My God!

1326
02:19:17,157 --> 02:19:18,818
Wow!

1327
02:19:19,893 --> 02:19:21,155
Congrats!

1328
02:19:22,062 --> 02:19:24,155
That's your gift.

1329
02:19:26,900 --> 02:19:28,891
