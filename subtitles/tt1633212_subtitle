Do Iook in the mirror once for sure.

154

Mister, step forward onIy
if you have the courage.

155
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:06,807
And if you are so crazy, then
come to HoteI Crown PIaza, Dubai.

156
00:16:07,646 --> 00:16:08,977
To see her dance.

157
00:16:10,015 --> 00:16:12,848
But make sure that
your pockets are fuII.

158
00:16:13,953 --> 00:16:15,978
Because you don't
get anything for free.

159

Hey, heroine, aren't

165
00:17:23,054 --> 00:17:25,045
Hurry up. It's time for the fIight.

166
00:17:25,724 --> 00:17:27,419
I don't own the pIane.

167
00:17:42,807 --> 00:17:45,105
We won't be making any money here.

168
00:17:45,744 --> 00:17:50,374
True. Look at them, how they

And we are dressed up in 'SaIwaar

Who wiII Iook at us?

Look. Look. Look. Look how
everyone is eyeing them.

172
00:18:00,592 --> 00:18:01,684
Like hungry dogs.

173
00:18:02,227 --> 00:18:05,094
Disgusting. Look how they are
Iifting their Iegs to show skin.

174
00:18:06,164 --> 00:18:07,563
These women have no shame.

175
00:18:08,566 --> 00:18:09,692
I don't want to see aII this.

176
00:18:10,735 --> 00:18:12,032
Nargis.
- Yes?

177
00:18:13,304 --> 00:18:14,464
Aunt's on the Iine.

178
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,200
TaIk to her.

179
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:22,205
HeIIo.

180
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,376
You shouId start a conversation
with a greeting, Nargis.

181
00:18:26,084 --> 00:18:29,576
I don't Iike these
EngIish saIutations.

182
00:18:29,721 --> 00:18:32,656
WeII.. Greetings, Aunt.

183
00:18:33,124 --> 00:18:37,220
Sabik was saying that none
of the dance shows went weII.

184
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:41,722
In Jordan, a sheikh was giving
you Rs. 2 Iakhs for a night..

185
00:18:42,133 --> 00:18:44,795
..but you refused to go to him.

186
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:48,730
What is it? Why are
you acting too smart?

187
00:18:49,874 --> 00:18:51,239
No, Aunt.

188
00:18:51,843 --> 00:18:53,538
The dance shows went weII.

189
00:18:54,479 --> 00:18:58,347
But I..I got scared of that man.

190
00:18:58,783 --> 00:19:03,117
Strange. UntiI yesterday
men used to get scared of us.

191
00:19:04,422 --> 00:19:06,617
And now our girIs are
getting scared of them?

192
00:19:08,526 --> 00:19:09,857
Forgive me, Aunt.

193
00:19:11,095 --> 00:19:12,289
This wiII never happen again.

194
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:16,626
Shut up. I am not
running an orphanage. Got it?

195
00:19:19,337 --> 00:19:20,736
This is my shop.

196
00:19:21,739 --> 00:19:24,674
I won't toIerate
even a penny's Ioss.

197
00:19:26,444 --> 00:19:30,847
Dance or seII yourseIf, it
makes no difference to me.

198
00:19:31,516 --> 00:19:33,643
You wiII get to eat onIy
if you make me some money.

199
00:19:34,452 --> 00:19:36,784
Otherwise, I'II cut
your hands and Iegs..

200
00:19:37,222 --> 00:19:40,851
..and throw you and your
mother on the streets to beg.

201
00:19:45,697 --> 00:19:50,566
Now you decide, Nargis,
whether you want aIms..

202
00:19:50,635 --> 00:19:54,503
..thrown into your bowI or
money Iying at your feet.

203
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,440
My name is Zohra.

204
00:19:58,409 --> 00:20:00,741
I can create both the situations.

205
00:20:11,456 --> 00:20:14,254
When I've toId you once
that you cannot go to Dubai..

206
00:20:14,425 --> 00:20:15,824
..it means you cannot go there.

207
00:20:16,327 --> 00:20:17,589
Why don't you understand?

208
00:20:18,596 --> 00:20:20,757
Dubai is fuII of
Indians and Pakistanis.

209
00:20:20,932 --> 00:20:22,957
They wiII recognize you in no time.

210
00:20:23,201 --> 00:20:24,828
And you know what
wiII happen after that.

211
00:23:21,612 --> 00:23:23,409
I wonder what wiII happen today.

212
00:23:23,481 --> 00:23:26,746
Yes. Aunt wiII scoId us.
She won't spare us today.

213
00:23:29,687 --> 00:23:32,121
Get in. Come on, Naaz. Come on.

214
00:23:33,091 --> 00:23:34,581
What are you waiting for,
Nargis? Get in.

215
00:25:08,786 --> 00:25:11,016
Hey, you don't know. He won't come.

216
00:25:26,971 --> 00:25:28,871
Nargis. Look, Brother-in-Iaw.

217
00:25:29,207 --> 00:25:30,902
I think he is foIIowing you.

218
00:25:31,008 --> 00:25:32,407
Oh, God, he has come here?

219
00:25:32,677 --> 00:25:33,905
Nargis, Iet's go. Hurry up.

220
00:25:34,011 --> 00:25:36,070
We wiII be in
troubIe if we get caught.

221
00:25:38,049 --> 00:25:39,949
Let's go.
- You go.

222
00:25:40,418 --> 00:25:41,476
Die, you fooI.

223
00:26:01,706 --> 00:26:02,832
Your scarf.

224
00:26:09,313 --> 00:26:12,578
From Jordan to Dubai,
Dubai to the hoteI..

225
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:16,142
..and from the hoteI to here, you
had come to give this back to me?

226
00:26:19,624 --> 00:26:21,990
I wanted to keep it with me.

227
00:26:23,594 --> 00:26:25,357
But then I thought
that you might need it.

228
00:26:27,865 --> 00:26:30,595
I needed it, but not anymore.

229
00:26:32,003 --> 00:26:33,971
You can keep it.
- Thank you.

230
00:26:36,874 --> 00:26:38,307
By the way,
what wiII you do with it?

231
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:40,870
WiII you tie it on your head?

232
00:26:42,747 --> 00:26:44,180
WiII you wrap it
around your hand or..

233
00:26:45,149 --> 00:26:46,878
..keep it tied around your neck?

234
00:26:47,752 --> 00:26:48,844
I don't know.

235
00:26:50,821 --> 00:26:52,584
But if you keep vanishing this way..

236
00:26:53,724 --> 00:26:55,214
..I wiII sureIy hang myseIf with it.

237
00:26:57,028 --> 00:26:58,962
But this is too short for that.

238
00:26:59,697 --> 00:27:02,097
If you want, I can
send a 3-foot Iong stoIe.

239
00:27:02,967 --> 00:27:04,730
It's not needed.

240
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:10,973
You keep Iooking at me
and I wiII die anyway.

241
00:27:13,411 --> 00:27:15,811
How are you abIe to
say such sweet things?

242
00:27:18,749 --> 00:27:21,274
Don't you feeI disgusted to Iook
at a fIower that grows in the muck?

243
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,847
That's the speciaIity
of this fIower.

244
00:27:27,658 --> 00:27:31,094
Though it grows in the muck,
it stays above it.

245
00:27:35,132 --> 00:27:37,191
Nargis, you are not
made for this market.

246
00:27:38,402 --> 00:27:40,370
God has made you for me.

247
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,871
I want to take you home.

248
00:27:50,381 --> 00:27:51,678
Are you for reaI?

249
00:27:53,851 --> 00:27:54,909
Touch me and see for yourseIf.

250
00:28:00,458 --> 00:28:03,894
''Oh, my Iove.''

251
00:28:05,162 --> 00:28:08,689
''I don't want to Iive without you.''

252
00:28:18,442 --> 00:28:24,278
''My desires came to
Iife when I saw you.''

253
00:28:25,716 --> 00:28:31,382
''I am restIess without you.''

254
00:28:33,357 --> 00:28:39,853
''OnIy God knows what

255
00:28:56,514 --> 00:29:02,111
''My desires came to
Iife when I saw you.''

256
00:29:03,521 --> 00:29:09,118
''I am restIess without you.''

257
00:29:10,895 --> 00:29:16,299
''My desires came to

258
00:29:17,735 --> 00:29:23,264
''I am restIess without you.''

259
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:32,214
''OnIy God knows what
wiII happen next.''

260
00:29:34,318 --> 00:29:37,378
''Oh, my beIoved.''

261
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:42,082
''Oh, my beIoved.''

262
00:29:43,928 --> 00:29:47,056
''Oh, my beIoved.''

263
00:29:47,364 --> 00:29:50,856
''Oh, my beIoved.''

264
00:30:11,155 --> 00:30:18,254
''My emotions are not
in my controI anymore.''

265
00:30:18,395 --> 00:30:23,025
''I pray aII night Iong.''

266
00:30:23,167 --> 00:30:30,266
''No matter what the
circumstances are now.''

267
00:30:30,341 --> 00:30:35,040
''I just want to be with you.''

268
00:30:35,112 --> 00:30:37,512
''You are my worId.''

269
00:30:37,581 --> 00:30:39,913
''You are my desire.''

270
00:30:42,153 --> 00:30:48,319
''You dweII in my heart.''

271
00:30:48,392 --> 00:30:54,024
''My desires came to
Iife when I saw you.''

272
00:30:55,166 --> 00:31:01,036
''I am restIess without you.''

273
00:31:01,172 --> 00:31:07,270
''OnIy God knows what

274
00:31:09,446 --> 00:31:12,711
''Oh, my beIoved.''

275
00:31:14,251 --> 00:31:17,311
''Oh, my beIoved.''

276
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:53,256
''I have handed over my Iife to you.''

277
00:31:53,457 --> 00:31:57,723
''I don't mind being
destroyed in your Iove.''

278
00:31:58,062 --> 00:32:05,025
''I have worshiped
you whoIeheartedIy.''

279
00:32:05,369 --> 00:32:09,669
''This is Iove and not bantering.''

280
00:32:10,107 --> 00:32:16,103
''Whenever you Iook

281
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:23,151
''..you wiII find me in it.''

282

00:32:56,487 --> 00:32:59,752
''Oh, my beIoved.''

288
00:33:01,258 --> 00:33:04,227
''Oh, my beIoved.''

289
00:33:04,295 --> 00:33:06,058
HeIIo.
- HeIIo.

290
00:33:06,597 --> 00:33:09,589
The one you are here for
has gone back to her country.

291
00:33:09,667 --> 00:33:11,225
What are you saying?

292
00:33:11,669 --> 00:33:13,136
She went back?

293
00:33:13,203 --> 00:33:16,195
Sir, it's aIways a
3-month Iong contract.

294
00:33:16,607 --> 00:33:19,041
3 months are up. Visa got expired.

295
00:33:23,347 --> 00:33:24,837
She has Ieft this Ietter for you.

296
00:33:34,825 --> 00:33:36,656
I guess you don't know Urdu.

297
00:33:37,394 --> 00:33:39,419
I had written it for her.

298
00:33:40,097 --> 00:33:41,257
If you want, I'II
aIso read it for you.

299
00:33:46,503 --> 00:33:47,561
''Rajeev..''

300
00:33:48,472 --> 00:33:51,771
'You used to say that I
beIong in a home, right?'

301
00:33:52,743 --> 00:33:56,179
'A pIace where someone
Ioves me and takes care of me.'

302
00:33:57,614 --> 00:34:00,412
'I had started
trusting everything you said.'

303
00:34:01,618 --> 00:34:03,142
'I had started dreaming.'

304
00:34:04,455 --> 00:34:07,720
'But I woke up and
my dreams shattered.'

305
00:34:08,392 --> 00:34:09,882
'This is my reaIity.'

306
00:34:11,295 --> 00:34:12,819
'I'II meet the same fate..

307
00:34:12,896 --> 00:34:14,329
..as everyone eIse in
'Heera Mandi' (Diamond Market).'

308
00:34:14,798 --> 00:34:16,663
'And I cannot change it.'

309
00:34:17,434 --> 00:34:19,402
'You don't try to change it either.'

310
00:34:21,405 --> 00:34:23,305
'I don't have the
courage to bid fareweII.'

311
00:34:25,476 --> 00:34:27,569
'That's why I am going
back without meeting you.'

312
00:34:28,846 --> 00:34:31,280
'May God give you aII the
happiness in the worId.'

313
00:34:32,349 --> 00:34:33,475
'Nargis.'

314
00:34:35,319 --> 00:34:38,914
Her deaI has been made with a
very rich man named Sajjad Nawaz.

315
00:34:41,625 --> 00:34:43,422
He is giving Rs. 5 Iakhs.

316
00:34:46,597 --> 00:34:47,859
Nothing can be done now.

317
00:34:48,565 --> 00:34:50,328
The girI beIongs to him
once the word is given.

318
00:34:55,939 --> 00:34:57,304
There is one option.

319
00:34:58,542 --> 00:35:00,703
You give 10 and
Nargis wiII be yours.

320
00:35:03,814 --> 00:35:05,611
Many a times,
deaIs change Iike that.

321
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,148
HeIIo? - HeIIo. Mr. Stuart,

Okay.

330

''Don't Iook at me in

331
00:35:49,226 --> 00:35:52,662
''My Iove, I wiII die.''

332
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:57,796
''Don't Iook at me in

''My Iove, I wiII die.''

334
00:36:02,139 --> 00:36:06,132
''Rosy Iips, intoxicating eyes.''

335
00:36:06,276 --> 00:36:10,713
''You are as
beautifuI as the pink moon.''

336
00:36:10,948 --> 00:36:13,508
''On top of that.. On top of that..''

337
00:36:13,584 --> 00:36:17,145
''On top of that,

338
00:36:25,996 --> 00:36:27,122
Lahore.

339
00:37:26,023 --> 00:37:31,086
Babur's Iife. Babur's heaven.

340
00:37:31,161 --> 00:37:34,358
'AIIah' (IsIamic deity),
have mercy. 'AIIah', have mercy.

341
00:37:34,598 --> 00:37:42,630
Look. Look at your SuItan's shirt
once again. - 'AIIah', have mercy.

342
00:37:42,973 --> 00:37:47,034
It stiII has the
stains of his bIood.

343
00:37:49,846 --> 00:37:51,040
You were right.

344
00:37:52,082 --> 00:37:55,176
'AIIah' definiteIy
answers an earnest prayer.

345
00:37:58,789 --> 00:38:00,654
Now you go to sIeep peacefuIIy.

346
00:38:02,359 --> 00:38:05,157
By God, I'II bring
his dead body here.

347
00:38:06,863 --> 00:38:09,661
I'II wash your feet with his bIood.

348
00:38:12,402 --> 00:38:19,069
If I don't do this, don't spare me.

349
00:38:21,211 --> 00:38:23,111
Don't ever forgive me.

350
00:39:13,063 --> 00:39:14,997
Who is this new Iover boy?

351
00:39:17,934 --> 00:39:21,165
Where are you going with
this cute IittIe face, mister?

352
00:39:22,672 --> 00:39:24,640
Are you the security officer here?

353
00:39:24,708 --> 00:39:28,508
Oh, 'AIIah'. What an attitude!
- Look at him..

354
00:39:28,578 --> 00:39:31,046
He's hot-bIooded. What tantrums!

355
00:39:31,114 --> 00:39:34,743
Are you a IandIord? An inspector?
Or a mayor?

356
00:39:36,686 --> 00:39:38,176
I've come here to meet someone.

357
00:39:38,255 --> 00:39:41,747
Meet me first.
Introduce yourseIf to me.

358
00:39:41,992 --> 00:39:44,119
I'm GuIab Jaan. And you?

359
00:39:44,528 --> 00:39:46,462
Is it necessary to
answer this question?

360
00:39:47,564 --> 00:39:51,193
Mister, this is our factory
and not a roadside hoteI..

361
00:39:51,268 --> 00:39:53,634
..that you come, eat,
pay the biII and Ieave.

362
00:39:53,703 --> 00:39:54,965
WiII you teII me the
reason of your visit..

363
00:39:55,038 --> 00:39:56,630
..or shaII I bring an
auto to send you home?

364
00:39:57,541 --> 00:39:59,008
I've come to meet Nargis.

365
00:39:59,075 --> 00:40:03,409
Nargis? Oh, God, you
Iook Iike a decent man.

366
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,971
Are you an Indian?
- No, Japanese.

367
00:40:07,617 --> 00:40:08,777
Do you know Nargis?

368
00:40:09,019 --> 00:40:10,213
Which Nargis are you taIking about?

369
00:40:10,287 --> 00:40:11,379
There are severaI
girIs named Nargis here.

370
00:40:11,454 --> 00:40:13,046
There is a Nargis in every house.

371
00:40:13,123 --> 00:40:17,651
My Nargis is the one who is one of
a kind in this worId. - Oh, Lord.

372
00:40:18,795 --> 00:40:22,253
Our Nargis? When did
she cast a speII on you?

373
00:40:22,332 --> 00:40:23,799
WeII, why shouId I bother?

374
00:40:24,034 --> 00:40:26,502
It is my work to go on the street,
bring the customers..

375
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:28,561
..earn money and enjoy.

376
00:40:29,206 --> 00:40:32,039
Nargis. That is her house.

377
00:40:33,076 --> 00:40:34,805
Come. FoIIow me.

378
00:40:35,445 --> 00:40:44,376
''Come in, darIing, the
entire dispute wiII get settIed.''

379
00:40:44,688 --> 00:40:46,588
GuIab Jaan, you have come
again without being caIIed.

380
00:40:47,724 --> 00:40:49,214
I'm aIready in a bad mood.

381
00:40:49,292 --> 00:40:53,490
So what's new about that? You are
out of your senses since chiIdhood.

382
00:40:54,798 --> 00:40:57,392
ShaII I say something now or Ieave?

383
00:40:57,601 --> 00:40:59,398
Okay, teII me quickIy
what you want to say.

384
00:40:59,736 --> 00:41:04,673
A handsome guy has come outside.
His name is Rajeev.

385
00:41:07,577 --> 00:41:09,044
Rajeev?

386
00:41:12,215 --> 00:41:13,477
My Rajeev?

387
00:41:17,354 --> 00:41:20,482
Where is he?
Where have you Ieft him?

388
00:41:20,824 --> 00:41:24,191
Aunty? Did aunty see him?
Where is aunty?

389
00:41:24,261 --> 00:41:25,387
TeII me.

390
00:41:25,462 --> 00:41:29,057
Why are you getting so impatient,
siIIy? Have patience.

391
00:41:29,132 --> 00:41:31,600
Zohra is appIying
make-up in her room..

392
00:41:31,668 --> 00:41:33,329
..and your Rajesh Khanna
(Indian actor)..

393
00:41:33,403 --> 00:41:34,768
..is standing in the veranda. Go.

394
00:41:35,372 --> 00:41:37,499
Oh, Sister GuIab. Oh, God.

395
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:45,873
SIowIy. SIowIy. Has an
earthquake occurred?

396
00:41:47,117 --> 00:41:50,348
Aunty, he.. he has come.

397
00:41:51,288 --> 00:41:53,347
He? Who he?

398
00:41:54,691 --> 00:41:56,124
Rajeev.

399
00:41:57,294 --> 00:42:00,627
I'II speak to him.
You go to your room.

400
00:42:04,734 --> 00:42:07,362
Didn't you hear? I said go.

401
00:42:16,146 --> 00:42:17,511
Have a seat.

402
00:42:24,387 --> 00:42:26,480
I heard about you from Sadiq.

403
00:42:27,924 --> 00:42:30,392
The girIs were praising you a Iot.

404
00:42:32,228 --> 00:42:35,527
TeII me. How can I serve you?

405
00:42:35,932 --> 00:42:39,663
I don't want your service,
but your permission.

406
00:42:41,638 --> 00:42:44,505
I've come to take Nargis's paIanquin
from 'Heera Mandi' (Diamond Market).

407
00:42:51,348 --> 00:42:52,542
ReaIIy?

408
00:42:55,318 --> 00:42:59,618
Did onIy I hear this
or so did aII of you?

409
00:43:00,657 --> 00:43:04,718
We heard it. We aII heard it,
madam. Very cIearIy.

410
00:43:09,332 --> 00:43:14,326
Look, mister, this is the onIy
difference between our worIds.

411
00:43:14,804 --> 00:43:18,570
Neither do we have any
expectations nor any dreams.

412
00:43:19,409 --> 00:43:24,506
We make our girIs dance,
sing and we even seII them.

413
00:43:26,649 --> 00:43:28,844
But we don't depart
them in a paIanquin.

414
00:43:35,225 --> 00:43:38,991
If our girIs start wearing the
wedding outfits one by one..

415
00:43:39,529 --> 00:43:42,362
..then we wiII starve to death.
Right?

416
00:43:42,832 --> 00:43:44,493
That won't be the case.

417
00:43:45,735 --> 00:43:51,435
I'm ready to pay twice the
price you have bid for Nargis.

418
00:43:54,978 --> 00:43:57,674
It's better if you don't
Iure us with your weaIth.

419
00:43:58,281 --> 00:44:01,614
We have enough men to
squander weaIth on us.

420
00:44:04,487 --> 00:44:08,446
If you wish, you can buy
her for one or ten nights.

421
00:44:08,992 --> 00:44:10,721
I don't have any objection.

422
00:44:13,029 --> 00:44:16,294
Nargis is not a source of
pIeasure for me, she is my Iife.

423
00:44:16,499 --> 00:44:17,830
My Iove.

424
00:44:19,803 --> 00:44:24,035
Love is an evanescent
emotion and marriage is a bad deaI.

425
00:44:25,909 --> 00:44:28,742
TaIk about buying and
seIIing the girI, mister.

426
00:44:29,412 --> 00:44:31,744
It is the best business ever.

427
00:44:33,683 --> 00:44:37,642
You want Nargis, right?
Pay me and take her away.

428
00:44:41,357 --> 00:44:42,756
Then as you wish.

429
00:44:52,402 --> 00:44:54,563
Don't think more or
it wiII be too Iate.

430
00:44:54,804 --> 00:44:56,704
Then you wiII Iament
the entire night.

431
00:44:59,442 --> 00:45:03,276
I'm in Iove. I'm bound
to be reduced to ashes.

432
00:45:05,081 --> 00:45:06,605
I'II bring the money.

433
00:45:54,464 --> 00:46:00,460
''Yours. Mine.''

434
00:46:21,357 --> 00:46:25,384
''Don't deIay tasting it, beIoved.''

435
00:46:27,463 --> 00:46:31,422
''The berries of Iove have ripened.''

436
00:46:33,603 --> 00:46:37,903
''Don't deIay tasting it, beIoved.''

437
00:46:39,709 --> 00:46:43,907
''The berries of Iove have ripened.''

438
00:46:46,216 --> 00:46:52,280
''Tie the strings. Tie the strings.''

439
00:46:52,355 --> 00:46:54,482
''Tie the strings.''

440
00:46:56,626 --> 00:47:01,859
''Yours. Mine.''

441
00:47:02,765 --> 00:47:07,600
''Yours. Mine.''

442
00:47:46,342 --> 00:47:52,303
''I can't spend the Iong nights now.''

443
00:47:52,482 --> 00:47:56,748
''What shouId I do, sweetheart?''

444
00:47:58,554 --> 00:48:04,459
''The worId of dreams is
sweeter than jaggery.''

445
00:48:04,661 --> 00:48:08,961
''What shouId I do, darIing?''

446
00:48:10,466 --> 00:48:14,368
''Don't deIay tasting it, beIoved.''

447
00:48:14,971 --> 00:48:18,907
''The berries of Iove have ripened.''

448
00:48:19,842 --> 00:48:24,836
''Tie the strings. Tie the strings.''

449
00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:32,615
''Yours. Mine.''

450
00:48:33,523 --> 00:48:38,358
''Yours. Mine.''

451
00:49:04,354 --> 00:49:08,450
''Don't deIay tasting it, beIoved.''

452
00:49:08,858 --> 00:49:12,794
''The berries of Iove have ripened.''

453
00:49:13,696 --> 00:49:18,759
''Tie the strings. Tie the strings.''

454
00:49:21,104 --> 00:49:26,542
''Yours. Mine.''

455
00:49:27,377 --> 00:49:31,973
''Yours. Mine.''

456
00:49:33,516 --> 00:49:38,715
''Yours. Mine.''

457
00:49:39,655 --> 00:49:44,456
''Yours. Mine.''

458
00:50:52,728 --> 00:50:54,628
It's time for me to Ieave.

459
00:51:22,558 --> 00:51:24,423
You wiII not go back there.

460
00:51:27,563 --> 00:51:29,895
Why to think about
something which is impossibIe?

461
00:51:32,668 --> 00:51:35,432
I can do anything
to make it possibIe.

462
00:51:38,774 --> 00:51:40,605
But I can't do this.

463
00:51:42,712 --> 00:51:45,704
Neither I nor my mother has the
guts to go against aunty Zohra.

464
00:51:48,584 --> 00:51:52,884
And if I went against her, she wiII
make my mother's Iife miserabIe.

465
00:51:56,025 --> 00:51:58,892
The thought of Ieaving you
has made me so heIpIess..

466
00:52:01,264 --> 00:52:03,198
..that I've started hating myseIf.

467
00:52:06,202 --> 00:52:09,262
But we wiII meet.
We wiII meet everyday.

468
00:52:12,108 --> 00:52:13,837
I wiII never Ieave you aIone.

469
00:52:25,588 --> 00:52:31,493
I don't know for which merit
or good deed I've got you.

470
00:52:33,229 --> 00:52:34,992
But I'II sureIy say that..

471
00:52:37,099 --> 00:52:38,862
..you have given me aII
the happiness in the worId..

472
00:52:38,935 --> 00:52:40,835
..by giving Iove to a girI Iike me.

473
00:52:43,606 --> 00:52:46,541
Now whether I stay in your
heaven or aunty Zohra's misery..

474
00:52:49,078 --> 00:52:50,943
..it doesn't make
any difference to me.

475
00:52:56,652 --> 00:52:58,279
It doesn't make
any difference to me.

476
00:53:02,659 --> 00:53:03,751
You know..
- What happened?

477
00:53:03,993 --> 00:53:05,426
Everyone ordered drinks
at the hoteI.

478
00:53:05,495 --> 00:53:09,090
Hey, guys. Guys. He is Rocky,
isn't he? Rocky Kapoor.

479
00:53:09,499 --> 00:53:11,194
I think you have not got
rid of Iast night's hangover.

480
00:53:11,267 --> 00:53:12,495
Have you just had
another drink in your room?

481
00:53:12,569 --> 00:53:15,561
Buddy, I'm serious. He is Rocky.
- You expIain to him.

482
00:53:15,638 --> 00:53:19,665
Are you crazy? Why wouId
Rocky come here to Lahore? - Yes.

483
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:21,301
I think you have gone insane.
- You are right.

484
00:53:21,377 --> 00:53:22,742
He is Rocky.

485
00:53:22,979 --> 00:53:24,742
Do you bet?
- I'm in.

486
00:53:24,981 --> 00:53:27,040
1000 pounds.
- And I'II definiteIy win this time.

487
00:53:27,117 --> 00:53:29,449
You?
- Hey..

488
00:53:29,586 --> 00:53:31,281
You just keep my money ready.

489
00:53:32,288 --> 00:53:33,414
HeIIo, sir.

490
00:53:34,624 --> 00:53:39,027
MyseIf AIi. ActuaIIy, sir,
I've made a bet with them.

491
00:53:39,095 --> 00:53:40,687
I toId them that you are Rocky.

492
00:53:40,764 --> 00:53:43,289
Rocky Kapoor, the
Ione Indian from London.

493
00:53:44,768 --> 00:53:46,497
You have been mistaken.

494
00:53:47,070 --> 00:53:49,265
My name is Rajeev and not Rocky.

495
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:53,173
He is joking. It's ajoke,
right? You are joking, aren't you?

496
00:53:53,343 --> 00:53:54,742
You are Rocky, right?

497
00:53:55,111 --> 00:53:57,443
Look, you are drunk. Excuse me.

498
00:53:57,514 --> 00:54:00,176
Sir. Sir. Sir, I had toId
him that he wiII Iose the bet.

499
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:01,478
You've Iost it, right? Come on,
give me money. Take it out.

500
00:54:01,551 --> 00:54:03,382
Wait. I've not Iost the bet.

501
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:05,520
He is Iying. He is Rocky.

502
00:54:05,588 --> 00:54:07,579
TeII me if you have some probIem.

503
00:54:07,824 --> 00:54:10,759
I see. You are hiding your
identity because a girI is with you.

504
00:54:12,495 --> 00:54:14,690
By the way, she is mind bIowing,
paI.

505
00:54:17,066 --> 00:54:18,761
You have brought her
from 'Heera Mandi', right?

506
00:54:19,736 --> 00:54:21,431
Hey? What are you doing?

507
00:54:23,773 --> 00:54:25,832
Rajeev. Rajeev, Ieave him.

508
00:54:27,043 --> 00:54:28,169
Let him go.

509
00:54:30,113 --> 00:54:33,776
Rajeev. Is anyone here?
Is anyone here?

510
00:54:34,417 --> 00:54:35,645
Rajeev.

511
00:54:38,521 --> 00:54:39,613
Rajeev.

512
00:54:45,228 --> 00:54:47,059
Sir. Sir, Ieave him. Leave him.

513
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:48,392
Rajeev, Iet them go.

514
00:55:10,119 --> 00:55:16,183
Nargis, won't you even bid
goodbye to me? What's wrong?

515
00:55:20,864 --> 00:55:23,298
I'm not afraid of a Iie,
but the truth.

516
00:55:24,434 --> 00:55:27,335
If the truth is that
I've beIieved a Iie..

517
00:55:28,504 --> 00:55:31,803
If the truth is that the one
I Iove is hiding something from me..

518
00:55:34,677 --> 00:55:37,441
If the truth is that aII this
was just a dream and nothing eIse..

519
00:55:37,513 --> 00:55:41,472
..then I feeI scared that what
if aII that happened with my mother..

520
00:55:41,551 --> 00:55:43,416
..is about to happen
with me as weII.

521
00:55:46,689 --> 00:55:50,682
Why are you quiet? Answer me.

522
00:55:54,364 --> 00:55:57,231
Who are you? Who are you?

523
00:55:59,535 --> 00:56:00,695
You are definiteIy not that person..

524
00:56:00,770 --> 00:56:02,795
..as whom you have
introduced yourseIf to me.

525
00:56:07,477 --> 00:56:08,876
You are right.

526
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:12,309
Your doubt is correct.

527
00:56:14,384 --> 00:56:16,249
I'm not the person
who you think I am.

528
00:56:18,454 --> 00:56:20,183
My name is not Rajeev.

529
00:56:22,592 --> 00:56:27,928
Whatever I've toId you
about me tiII today is a Iie.

530
00:56:30,833 --> 00:56:32,596
I've committed a murder.

531
00:56:56,192 --> 00:56:57,318
Nargis.

532
00:57:00,229 --> 00:57:01,662
Nargis, open the door.

533
00:57:03,332 --> 00:57:04,799
Nargis, open the door.

534
00:57:09,572 --> 00:57:11,039
Don't come near me.

535
00:57:12,341 --> 00:57:14,172
I don't want to taIk
you about anything.

536
00:57:15,478 --> 00:57:16,740
Go away from here.

537
00:57:17,113 --> 00:57:19,081
I don't want to see
your face as weII.

538
00:57:19,248 --> 00:57:21,842
I'II go away. I'II go away forever.

539
00:57:23,352 --> 00:57:25,047
But pIease Iisten to me once.

540
00:57:25,121 --> 00:57:27,715
After that
I'II never bother you again.

541
00:57:29,492 --> 00:57:33,121
I had never intended to Iie
or keep any secrets from you.

542
00:57:35,197 --> 00:57:36,721
But there was no other option.

543
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:45,637
Yes, pIease?
- Ma'am, autograph. PIease.

544
00:57:45,708 --> 00:57:47,642
Can I get Rocky's autograph,
pIease, for my son?

545
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:49,200
Yes. Sure.

546
00:57:49,278 --> 00:57:50,336
Excuse me, sir.

547
00:57:50,413 --> 00:57:53,644
There is one Indian famiIy.
They want to take your autograph.

548
00:57:53,783 --> 00:57:55,580
Are you the singing star Rocky?
- Yes.

549
00:57:55,651 --> 00:57:57,141
Can give the sign?
- Thank you.

550
00:58:03,659 --> 00:58:05,149
Thank you. Thank you.
- Thank you, ma'am.

551
00:58:05,227 --> 00:58:06,524
You are weIcome.
- Let's go, Son.

552
00:58:14,637 --> 00:58:16,537
Excuse me, sir.
Are you feeIing okay?

553
00:58:16,606 --> 00:58:18,506
Where is the bathroom? Can
you guide me to the bathroom?

554
00:58:18,574 --> 00:58:20,371
Yes, sure. It's this side.

555
00:58:51,941 --> 00:58:55,240
Hey. Go back. Go back I say.

556
00:58:55,511 --> 00:58:56,671
Move aside.

557
00:58:57,813 --> 00:58:58,905
Go back.

558
00:58:59,148 --> 00:59:01,275
Nobody moves. Nobody moves, I say.

559
00:59:01,350 --> 00:59:02,544
KneeI down.

560
00:59:04,353 --> 00:59:05,877
Hey. Go back.

561
00:59:06,722 --> 00:59:09,452
Sit down. Go back. Don't step ahead.

562
00:59:09,659 --> 00:59:11,422
I'II kiII you. Okay?

563
00:59:11,527 --> 00:59:12,789
Don't move. I'II kiII you.

564
00:59:29,845 --> 00:59:32,609
'Heart throb Rocky Desai..

565
00:59:32,682 --> 00:59:36,948
..defeated a terrorist during a
hijack of Air India's fIight 333.'

566
00:59:37,353 --> 00:59:39,787
'Mr. Desai put his
Iife in great danger..'

567
00:59:39,855 --> 00:59:42,915
'..and disarmed the
dreaded terrorist SuItan.'

568
00:59:43,492 --> 00:59:45,926
Brother Rocky is a hero.
Brother Rocky is a hero.

569
00:59:45,995 --> 00:59:48,657
Brother Rocky is a hero..
- Enough. Drink your soup.

570
00:59:50,199 --> 00:59:51,894
Sir, caII for you.
- Yes.

571
00:59:53,335 --> 00:59:58,432
HeIIo? - HeIIo, Mr. Rocky.
Avtar Singh here from ScotIand yard.

572
00:59:59,408 --> 01:00:02,206
Yes?
- Listen to me carefuIIy.

573
01:00:02,745 --> 01:00:04,508
There is bad news for you.

574
01:00:08,617 --> 01:00:11,211
I'm sorry, sir. It's not possibIe.

575
01:00:11,554 --> 01:00:13,351
I can't even think of it.

576
01:00:14,290 --> 01:00:16,258
My sister is handicapped.

577
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:17,719
She can't even get up
and drink water.

578
01:00:17,793 --> 01:00:18,885
And you are teIIing me to..

579
01:00:18,961 --> 01:00:20,986
Babur is not an ordinary gangster.

580
01:00:21,697 --> 01:00:24,564
He is one of the most
wanted terrorists in the worId.

581
01:00:26,836 --> 01:00:28,963
And you have kiIIed his brother.

582
01:00:29,939 --> 01:00:33,841
He wiII never spare you,
your sister and every person..

583
01:00:33,909 --> 01:00:36,537
..who is cIose to you or wiII be.

584
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:40,371
Our UK poIice is searching him.

585
01:00:40,783 --> 01:00:44,617
But tiII then, you wiII have
to begin your Iife again..

586
01:00:44,687 --> 01:00:46,655
..with a new name
and a new identity.

587
01:00:46,722 --> 01:00:49,987
Mr. Singh, if the fear of
death snatches away my name..

588
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:53,653
..my identity and
my music from me..

589
01:00:53,829 --> 01:00:55,353
..then what wiII be
Ieft in such a Iife?'

590
01:00:55,431 --> 01:00:57,296
Don't argue with me, Rocky.

591
01:00:58,033 --> 01:01:00,627
We take your sister's
responsibiIity from today.

592
01:01:01,537 --> 01:01:04,005
PIease. Just go away.

593
01:01:05,307 --> 01:01:06,797
You have no choice.

594
01:01:24,794 --> 01:01:27,422
'He toId me to
forget my sister Sparsh.'

595
01:01:27,596 --> 01:01:31,692
'That I shouId begin my Iife
with a new name, a new identity.'

596
01:01:35,304 --> 01:01:37,966
I wouId do whatever he said.

597
01:01:39,341 --> 01:01:44,040
I wouId go to whichever city
and country he toId me to.

598
01:01:45,548 --> 01:01:48,381
But my sister's memory
couIdn't stop me for Iong.

599
01:01:50,452 --> 01:01:52,420
And one day, I returned back to UK.

600
01:02:00,996 --> 01:02:02,054
HeIIo?

601
01:02:02,131 --> 01:02:04,429
You want your sister to get kiIIed?

602
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:07,125
Do you want your sister
to get kiIIed?

603
01:02:07,369 --> 01:02:09,337
Dear, I'II just come.
- Why, Brother?

604
01:02:09,405 --> 01:02:10,929
Brother. - Don't you understand
inspite of having it expIained..

605
01:02:11,006 --> 01:02:12,598
..to you so many times?'

606
01:02:12,875 --> 01:02:14,399
Have you gone crazy?
- Brother.

607
01:02:15,110 --> 01:02:18,602
I can't Iive without her.
That's why I've returned.

608
01:02:19,782 --> 01:02:22,842
WiII you Iisten to me?
Just Iisten to me.

609
01:02:23,519 --> 01:02:26,579
Babur is going to
target you and your sister.

610
01:02:27,456 --> 01:02:31,586
For God's sake, drop everything
and come to me right now.

611
01:02:31,861 --> 01:02:34,022
Come to me right now. Right away.

612
01:02:35,865 --> 01:02:36,957
Yes, sir.

613
01:02:46,475 --> 01:02:49,069
Sparsh. Sparsh.

614
01:02:51,714 --> 01:02:53,614
Where is the IittIe girI?
- A man just took her.

615
01:02:53,682 --> 01:02:55,650
Who?
- I don't know the man.

616
01:02:56,118 --> 01:02:57,483
Sparsh?

617
01:02:57,553 --> 01:02:59,487
HeIIo? Is everything okay?

618
01:03:00,789 --> 01:03:03,781
If Babur wished, he
couId have kiIIed me.

619
01:03:04,426 --> 01:03:07,759
But he kiIIed my sister
to shatter me.

620
01:03:08,063 --> 01:03:10,122
And I Ieft UK forever.

621
01:03:16,672 --> 01:03:18,435
I wandered for many months.

622
01:03:20,409 --> 01:03:22,400
I kept on running on the
poIice's instructions.

623
01:03:25,481 --> 01:03:27,676
But my past didn't Ieave me aIone.

624
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:34,018
My sister's bIood-stained
dead body..

625
01:03:35,691 --> 01:03:37,215
..and the face of
the man I had kiIIed..

626
01:03:37,459 --> 01:03:39,154
..used to come
in front of my eyes..

627
01:03:39,695 --> 01:03:41,925
..and haunt me in my
dreams again and again.

628
01:03:45,801 --> 01:03:47,166
Then I met you.

629
01:03:49,204 --> 01:03:51,638
So I found reIief from
those dreadfuI memories.

630
01:03:53,709 --> 01:03:55,609
Now I don't have anyone except you.

631
01:03:57,947 --> 01:04:02,213
You are my path and my
destination as weII.

632
01:04:06,221 --> 01:04:07,984
I'II support you.

633
01:04:10,759 --> 01:04:12,886
I'II aIways be with you.

634
01:04:18,767 --> 01:04:22,225
Take me wherever you Iike,
I am ready.

635
01:04:24,273 --> 01:04:26,468
Don't even think of doing this.

636
01:04:29,511 --> 01:04:30,671
Aunty?

637
01:04:35,851 --> 01:04:37,751
What were you teIIing this man?

638
01:04:37,987 --> 01:04:42,219
Aunty, you don't know
anything about Rajeev.

639
01:04:43,192 --> 01:04:46,286
If you come to know..
- I won't hug him then.

640
01:04:47,129 --> 01:04:50,895
From today, you aIso don't
need to meet him. Get that?

641
01:04:53,502 --> 01:04:55,936
Come on, mister, go your way.

642
01:04:56,238 --> 01:04:57,899
But, Aunty, at Ieast Iisten to me.

643
01:04:57,973 --> 01:05:00,874
Your father aIso
used to say such things.

644
01:05:01,276 --> 01:05:04,712
Your mother was driven
to insanity in his Iove.

645
01:05:06,882 --> 01:05:08,747
She had thrown the
ankIets in the fire..

646
01:05:08,817 --> 01:05:11,115
..and foIIowed him as his Iover.

647
01:05:13,188 --> 01:05:14,746
And then what happened?

648
01:05:14,990 --> 01:05:17,754
He used her to his
heart's content for five years.

649
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:20,585
He gave birth to you
without marrying her.

650
01:05:22,331 --> 01:05:24,856
And then when she
was not young anymore..

651
01:05:24,933 --> 01:05:26,901
..and her face
started Iosing its charm..

652
01:05:26,969 --> 01:05:31,099
..he threw you mother and
daughter back in this market.

653
01:05:34,843 --> 01:05:37,573
If I hadn't been there
at that time, Nargis..

654
01:05:38,313 --> 01:05:41,612
..you both wouId have
been penniIess today.

655
01:05:41,817 --> 01:05:44,183
And no one wouId have even
given you a second gIance.

656
01:05:49,992 --> 01:05:53,689
If some peopIe are disIoyaI,
the IoyaIty doesn't perish.

657
01:05:55,597 --> 01:05:57,588
Trust me once.

658
01:05:58,901 --> 01:06:01,301
I'II give so much
respect and Iove to Nargis..

659
01:06:01,703 --> 01:06:03,864
..that she won't even
dream about 'Heera Mandi'.

660
01:06:04,773 --> 01:06:07,207
She wiII dream onIy if
she is aIive, mister.

661
01:06:07,843 --> 01:06:10,141
The man who himseIf is
running from death..

662
01:06:10,212 --> 01:06:12,703
..how wiII he ever
protect anyone eIse?

663
01:06:13,215 --> 01:06:17,117
And how can you
beIieve that your enemies..

664
01:06:17,186 --> 01:06:21,145
..wiII spare you aIive to Iet
you fuIfiI this dream of yours?

665
01:06:27,396 --> 01:06:29,227
A wedding procession wiII come here.

666
01:06:30,365 --> 01:06:32,196
A paIanquin wiII Ieave from here.

667
01:06:33,869 --> 01:06:37,396
And you yourseIf wiII
decorate and depart that paIanquin.

668
01:06:39,942 --> 01:06:42,069
Though I'm not sure of
anything eIse..

669
01:06:42,845 --> 01:06:45,109
..I'm sure of this, Madam Zohra.

670
01:06:56,358 --> 01:06:57,916
I wiII send the money.

671
01:07:03,165 --> 01:07:06,100
What? I can't withdraw the money?

672
01:07:06,935 --> 01:07:08,197
I've Iakhs of rupees in my account.

673
01:07:08,270 --> 01:07:11,000
I'm not saying that you don't
have money in your account, sir.

674
01:07:11,707 --> 01:07:15,040
But I can't do anything.
Your account has been bIocked.

675
01:07:15,277 --> 01:07:16,972
BIocked? Who has done that?

676
01:07:17,045 --> 01:07:18,637
It's an order
from ScotIand Yard, sir.

677
01:07:18,981 --> 01:07:21,950
Look, this is my money.
I need the money.

678
01:07:22,818 --> 01:07:24,308
I reaIIy need this money.

679
01:07:24,386 --> 01:07:27,355
Okay, sir. Speak to our
country head tomorrow.

680
01:07:27,689 --> 01:07:29,316
It is possibIe that he may heIp you.

681
01:07:35,230 --> 01:07:37,755
Don't worry, I'II speak to aunty.

682
01:07:38,967 --> 01:07:41,765
I'II say that the bank had
cIosed tiII we reached there.

683
01:07:43,105 --> 01:07:46,074
But you better make some arrangements
for the money by tomorrow.

684
01:07:47,910 --> 01:07:49,070
Let's go.

685
01:08:39,728 --> 01:08:47,999
''I want to Iive that moment again.''

686
01:08:52,174 --> 01:09:00,513
''I want to Iive that moment again.''

687
01:09:02,551 --> 01:09:08,888
''I want to Iive that moment again.''

688
01:09:10,993 --> 01:09:15,123
''We had met by chance.
We had bIoomed in those moments.''

689
01:09:15,197 --> 01:09:17,256
''The desires were fuIfiIIed.''

690
01:09:17,332 --> 01:09:19,357
''We were away from aII
the sorrows of the worId.''

691
01:09:19,434 --> 01:09:25,566
''I want to Iive that moment again.''

692
01:09:27,809 --> 01:09:33,941
''I want to Iive that moment again.''

693
01:09:36,151 --> 01:09:41,817
''I want to Iive that moment again.''

694
01:10:13,922 --> 01:10:20,293
''To sIeep in your arms.''

695
01:10:22,230 --> 01:10:28,567
''To be Iost in your dreams.''

696
01:10:30,572 --> 01:10:37,501
''To confess my feeIings to you.''

697
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:45,416
''Your memories haunt
me the entire night.''

698
01:10:46,521 --> 01:10:54,189
''You make me
restIess the entire night.''

699
01:11:00,068 --> 01:11:06,371
''I want to Iive that moment again.''

700
01:11:08,343 --> 01:11:14,339
''I want to Iive that moment again.''

701
01:11:58,660 --> 01:12:05,429
''My eyes gIance at you.''

702
01:12:07,169 --> 01:12:13,130
''Your taIks are very sweet.''

703
01:12:15,410 --> 01:12:22,282
''I think of you the entire night.''

704
01:12:23,151 --> 01:12:29,750
''I wouId sway with a
smiIe in your arms.''

705
01:12:31,593 --> 01:12:38,226
''I wouId sway and steaI
the mischief of your Iips.''

706
01:12:44,739 --> 01:12:49,073
''We had met by chance.
We had bIoomed in those moments.''

707
01:12:49,144 --> 01:12:51,169
''The desires were fuIfiIIed.''

708
01:12:51,246 --> 01:12:53,237
''We were away from aII
the sorrows of the worId.''

709
01:12:53,315 --> 01:12:59,515
''I want to Iive that moment again.''

710
01:13:01,556 --> 01:13:07,552
''I want to Iive that moment again.''

711
01:13:10,031 --> 01:13:15,560
''I want to Iive that moment again.''

712
01:13:18,340 --> 01:13:24,336
''I want to Iive that moment again.''

713
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:33,651
Sir.

714
01:13:35,290 --> 01:13:37,417
Excuse me, sir. Maintenance.

715
01:13:38,627 --> 01:13:41,221
There is a power faiIure in
the hoteI. PIease open the door.

716
01:13:48,203 --> 01:13:50,865
HeIIo.
Sir, there is a short circuit.

717
01:13:50,939 --> 01:13:53,169
Can I check the mains?
- Come.

718
01:13:53,241 --> 01:13:54,640
Thank you, sir.

719
01:14:44,259 --> 01:14:45,726
You check over there.

720
01:15:28,502 --> 01:15:31,130
Come on, Nargis.
Come. Get ready fast.

721
01:15:31,305 --> 01:15:33,102
Sajjad Nawaz is sending
a car for you.

722
01:15:33,274 --> 01:15:35,572
Aunty Zohra said that you have
to Ieave for there this evening.

723
01:15:35,810 --> 01:15:37,334
Come on, get ready fast. Come on.

724
01:15:37,411 --> 01:15:39,971
When Rajeev is ready to
pay my price every night..

725
01:15:40,214 --> 01:15:42,114
..then why shouId I go to an animaI?

726
01:15:42,183 --> 01:15:46,142
Go. Go and teII aunty Zohra
that I am not going there.

727
01:15:46,954 --> 01:15:48,922
He.. He must be here any moment.

728
01:15:48,989 --> 01:15:52,254
Look, Nargis, don't make
me angry or eIse I.. - Khan.

729
01:15:52,993 --> 01:15:55,154
Why are you troubIing her?

730
01:15:59,867 --> 01:16:03,098
Wow. I have seen many such Iovers.

731
01:16:03,904 --> 01:16:06,168
What they say at night,
is forgotten the next morning.

732
01:16:06,907 --> 01:16:09,341
He had asked me for 24 hours' time.

733
01:16:09,477 --> 01:16:12,935
And I gave him that on
this fooI's insistence.

734
01:16:14,215 --> 01:16:16,479
It's been two days
and that Iover boy..

735
01:16:16,550 --> 01:16:17,642
..is missing.

736
01:16:18,018 --> 01:16:20,509
There's no news about him at aII.

737
01:16:22,656 --> 01:16:24,214
Get ready fast.

738
01:16:25,092 --> 01:16:27,287
You have to go to
Sajjad Nawaz's mansion.

739
01:16:28,529 --> 01:16:30,121
I wiII die..

740
01:16:31,399 --> 01:16:33,196
..but I won't go to anyone eIse.

741
01:16:35,669 --> 01:16:38,502
You want to kiII me, right? KiII me.

742
01:16:39,140 --> 01:16:43,543
Take my Iife. But I wiII
never go to anyone eIse.

743
01:16:44,011 --> 01:16:45,342
Let me teII you that.

744
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:49,137
Why won't you go? He
has paid the price.

745
01:16:49,550 --> 01:16:51,313
I have taken advance for you.

746
01:16:51,452 --> 01:16:52,680
Then return the advance.

747
01:16:52,987 --> 01:16:55,148
Throw away aII the money,
I don't care at aII.

748
01:16:55,256 --> 01:16:57,315
And Iet me teII you one
thing cIearIy, Madam Zohra.

749
01:16:57,558 --> 01:17:00,391
My mother earned a Iot of
money for you aII her Iife.

750
01:17:00,561 --> 01:17:03,496
She fiIIed your safe with Iakhs
of rupees, but now it's enough.

751
01:17:04,365 --> 01:17:06,560
I won't Iet you force me anymore.

752
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:08,395
Do what you can.

753
01:17:10,371 --> 01:17:11,702
I see.

754
01:17:12,606 --> 01:17:15,939
So I have become
''madam'' from ''aunty'', is it?

755
01:17:16,610 --> 01:17:19,545
Fine. Now watch..

756
01:17:20,648 --> 01:17:25,642
..what happens when
aunty turns into madam.

757
01:17:31,492 --> 01:17:32,686
Go inside.

758
01:17:51,078 --> 01:17:53,103
No. No. No.
- Mother.

759
01:17:53,180 --> 01:17:56,411
Come on.
- No. No. - Mother. - Come on.

760
01:17:56,484 --> 01:18:00,215
Mother, save me.
- No. No. No.

761
01:18:00,287 --> 01:18:02,448
Don't beat her up.
Don't beat her up.

762
01:18:02,523 --> 01:18:04,548
Don't beat her up.
- For that guy you..

763
01:18:04,725 --> 01:18:07,319
Come on, apoIogize to aunty.
Come on.

764
01:18:26,313 --> 01:18:28,747
You're awake? Come.

765
01:18:29,483 --> 01:18:31,007
WiII you have something to eat?

766
01:18:34,455 --> 01:18:36,047
What's going on here?

767
01:18:37,658 --> 01:18:39,216
And what are you doing here?

768
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:42,993
You are in the Lahore Safe
House of Punjab government.

769
01:18:44,298 --> 01:18:46,459
And I have come to
take you back from here.

770
01:18:47,268 --> 01:18:50,362
You know, this is the most
dangerous pIace in the worId.

771
01:18:50,738 --> 01:18:53,730
These peopIe are fighting a
deadIy war against terrorism.

772
01:18:54,742 --> 01:18:57,711
Your Iife is in danger
and I can't take this risk.

773
01:18:58,445 --> 01:19:00,379
But how did you know that I am here?

774
01:19:00,581 --> 01:19:03,414
I toId you not to
operate your bank accounts.

775
01:19:04,051 --> 01:19:06,576
But you didn't Iisten to me,
did you? Look what happened now.

776
01:19:06,987 --> 01:19:08,784
Babur has aIso Iearnt through
the bank that you are here..

777
01:19:09,023 --> 01:19:10,490
..and now he has come here as weII.

778
01:19:13,027 --> 01:19:16,758
He is Mr. Tareeq Anwar. Head of
anti-terrorist squad, Lahore.

779
01:19:17,264 --> 01:19:19,095
He's the one who saved your Iife.

780
01:19:19,166 --> 01:19:22,033
If he wasn't there,
you wouIdn't have been aIive now.

781
01:19:23,237 --> 01:19:26,206
We are going back to UK tomorrow.
And that's finaI.

782
01:19:27,141 --> 01:19:29,803
I am tired of worrying
about my Iife.

783
01:19:31,011 --> 01:19:32,672
I don't need your heIp.

784
01:19:33,581 --> 01:19:36,175
PIease reIieve me of your security.

785
01:19:36,450 --> 01:19:38,179
And Ieave me aIone.

786
01:19:39,086 --> 01:19:42,055
You want to be Ieft aIone?
For whom?

787
01:19:42,690 --> 01:19:45,784
For the same girI whose name
you were babbIing in sIeep?

788
01:19:47,161 --> 01:19:49,356
You want to commit
suicide for her, right?

789
01:19:50,664 --> 01:19:53,428
You Iove Nargis a Iot?
- Yes.

790
01:19:53,767 --> 01:19:55,166
You are Iying.

791
01:19:55,235 --> 01:19:58,227
You don't Iove
anyone except yourseIf.

792
01:19:58,706 --> 01:20:02,802
You are risking her Iife for the
fear of going away from Nargis.

793
01:20:03,043 --> 01:20:05,443
You did the same with your sister.

794
01:20:07,314 --> 01:20:09,612
Rajeev, why don't you understand?

795
01:20:10,651 --> 01:20:12,642
Babur targets onIy those peopIe..

796
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:15,120
..who are cIose to
you and whom you Iove.

797
01:20:16,123 --> 01:20:19,183
He must've gathered aII the
information about Nargis by now.

798
01:20:20,728 --> 01:20:22,628
You have aIready
burned your sister's pyre.

799
01:20:23,197 --> 01:20:26,132
Now do you want to
attend Nargis' funeraI, too?

800
01:20:29,370 --> 01:20:32,066
Do you Iove her? Leave her.

801
01:20:44,518 --> 01:20:46,679
GuIab Jani. GuIab Jani.

802
01:20:48,188 --> 01:20:49,849
GuIab Jani, get up. -Who is it?

803
01:20:50,090 --> 01:20:51,614
Get up.
- Who is it? Who is it?

804
01:20:51,692 --> 01:20:53,592
Dacoits. Dacoits are here.

805
01:20:53,661 --> 01:20:54,889
It's me. It's me. Nargis.

806
01:20:55,129 --> 01:20:57,495
PIease don't shout. Do you
want to get me beaten up again?

807
01:20:59,199 --> 01:21:00,427
Nargis, it's you?

808
01:21:00,601 --> 01:21:03,092
I thought dacoits
are here to harass me.

809
01:21:03,671 --> 01:21:07,607
What happened? - GuIab Jani,
I need a IittIe heIp from you.

810
01:21:07,675 --> 01:21:08,903
I am running away from here.

811
01:21:10,277 --> 01:21:11,574
Oh, God. You wiII get me kiIIed.

812
01:21:11,645 --> 01:21:13,169
You have gone crazy.

813
01:21:13,247 --> 01:21:15,841
Aunty has beaten up and made
this girI Iose her sanity.

814
01:21:15,916 --> 01:21:19,147
My chiId, don't taIk
Iike that. Come and sIeep.

815
01:21:19,820 --> 01:21:22,186
I don't want to sIeep.
You think it's funny?

816
01:21:22,256 --> 01:21:24,554
What do you want? - I am running
away from here for reaI.

817
01:21:24,758 --> 01:21:26,623
What's this new idea you have now?

818
01:21:26,694 --> 01:21:28,628
Do you know what it means
to run away from here?

819
01:21:28,829 --> 01:21:31,559
Or has your memory aIso
become weak in that boy's Iove?

820
01:21:31,632 --> 01:21:32,929
I know everything.

821
01:21:33,167 --> 01:21:34,896
You just drop me at Rajeev's hoteI.

822
01:21:35,135 --> 01:21:36,193
I wiII take care of everything eIse.

823
01:21:36,270 --> 01:21:38,864
What wiII you take care of?
Who wiII take care of me?

824
01:21:38,939 --> 01:21:42,272
If aunty finds out about it,
she wiII kiII me for no reason.

825
01:21:42,342 --> 01:21:43,639
I don't want to die
at such a young age.

826
01:21:43,711 --> 01:21:46,805
If you want to go, catch an auto
and Ieave, but don't troubIe me.

827
01:21:48,215 --> 01:21:50,149
You wiII not heIp me?
- AbsoIuteIy not.

828
01:21:50,217 --> 01:21:52,549
I want to stay aIive
and watch cricket.

829
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:54,945
Go and die if you want to.

830
01:21:55,856 --> 01:21:59,724
AIright then. You sIeep,
enjoy your cricket. I..

831
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:01,894
I wiII go aIone.
- Okay, go. Go.

832
01:22:01,962 --> 01:22:03,554
Go. Go. Go.

833
01:22:03,630 --> 01:22:07,191
'AIIah' is great.
- 'AIIah' is great. Goodbye. Go. Go.

834
01:22:18,078 --> 01:22:19,375
Mother.

835
01:22:21,548 --> 01:22:22,947
Don't be scared.

836
01:22:24,118 --> 01:22:25,710
I won't say anything to you.

837
01:22:27,721 --> 01:22:31,487
Nor wiII I stop you from
doing what you want to do.

838
01:22:34,428 --> 01:22:36,487
What have I given you?

839
01:22:37,965 --> 01:22:39,489
Forget being a mother..

840
01:22:40,667 --> 01:22:42,601
..I couIdn't even be your friend.

841
01:22:46,006 --> 01:22:47,667
Neither did I ever fight for you..

842
01:22:49,009 --> 01:22:51,500
..nor couId I stop the hands
that were raised to hit you.

843
01:22:58,352 --> 01:23:01,549
And I am your first
broker as weII, my chiId.

844
01:23:05,392 --> 01:23:06,552
Run away.

845
01:23:07,194 --> 01:23:08,559
Go away from here.

846
01:23:09,429 --> 01:23:12,626
Wherever you wiII be,
you wiII be happier than here.

847
01:23:13,767 --> 01:23:17,134
Go, Nargis. Go.
- No, Sister.

848
01:23:25,979 --> 01:23:27,606
There is no use of going now.

849
01:23:28,015 --> 01:23:29,107
What?

850
01:23:31,084 --> 01:23:32,142
See this.

851
01:23:32,619 --> 01:23:33,745
What?

852
01:23:44,131 --> 01:23:45,189
What?

853
01:23:47,301 --> 01:23:48,632
What's there in it?

854
01:23:51,071 --> 01:23:52,561
News about your hero.

855
01:23:56,243 --> 01:23:59,701
The poIice are deporting him from
Pakistan to some other country.

856
01:24:04,151 --> 01:24:05,516
That's not possibIe.

857
01:24:06,620 --> 01:24:09,316
He has promised me that
he wiII take me aIong.

858
01:24:11,725 --> 01:24:13,192
You are Iying.

859
01:24:13,627 --> 01:24:16,027
You are Iying to me
on aunty's insistence.

860
01:24:17,331 --> 01:24:18,798
You are Iying, aren't you, Sadiq?

861
01:24:19,533 --> 01:24:22,195
Sadiq, you are Iying, aren't you?
- Why wouId I Iie?

862
01:24:25,305 --> 01:24:27,466
If you don't beIieve me, you can
make someone eIse read the newspaper.

863
01:24:40,454 --> 01:24:42,217
He aIso turned out
to be Iike father.

864
01:24:54,134 --> 01:24:55,362
What happened?

865
01:25:29,436 --> 01:25:34,373
''The nights that we..''

866
01:25:35,609 --> 01:25:39,670
''..spent together.''

867
01:25:43,483 --> 01:25:51,356
''The conversations
we had together.''

868
01:25:52,326 --> 01:25:57,559
''I remembered the shared
moments together.''

869
01:25:57,798 --> 01:26:01,290
''I remembered the times gone by.''

870
01:26:03,437 --> 01:26:07,305
''I remembered the times gone by.''

871
01:26:26,693 --> 01:26:30,288
Aunty, I am ready to seII myseIf.

872
01:26:31,498 --> 01:26:33,591
From now on, you own me.

873
01:26:34,568 --> 01:26:35,899
I'm your sIave.

874
01:26:43,477 --> 01:26:49,848
''Staying away from you..''

875
01:26:51,818 --> 01:26:57,313
''Staying away from you..''

876
01:26:57,391 --> 01:26:59,859
''..made me cry. Made me cry.''

877
01:27:00,193 --> 01:27:02,684
''Made me cry. Made me cry.''

878
01:27:02,829 --> 01:27:05,662
''Made me cry. Made me cry.''

879
01:27:05,732 --> 01:27:08,360
''Made me cry. Made me cry.''

880
01:27:08,568 --> 01:27:12,664
''The madness of your
thoughts made me cry.''

881
01:27:12,739 --> 01:27:16,835
''Your memories made me cry.''

882
01:27:16,910 --> 01:27:21,210
''That bond of
shattered dreams made me cry.''

883
01:27:21,481 --> 01:27:25,508
''It made me cry.''

884
01:27:27,554 --> 01:27:35,484
''Those Ianes
where we used to dream.''

885
01:27:35,862 --> 01:27:43,928
''Those moments which
we used to spend together.''

886
01:27:44,771 --> 01:27:50,368
''I remembered the moments
we shared together.''

887
01:27:50,444 --> 01:27:53,743
''I remembered the times gone by.''

888
01:27:55,715 --> 01:27:59,913
''I remembered the times gone by.''

889
01:28:26,980 --> 01:28:29,949
Greetings, Brother Tareeq.
- Greetings.

890
01:28:32,719 --> 01:28:36,712
Are you aIright? Is everything okay?
- Yes, everything's fine.

891
01:28:37,491 --> 01:28:40,358
Our communication team
has picked up some chatter.

892
01:28:41,361 --> 01:28:44,023
We Iearnt that Babur is
about to attack our safe house.

893
01:28:45,332 --> 01:28:47,323
For safety, send my man down.

894
01:28:47,834 --> 01:28:50,496
And after five minutes,
you come down as weII.

895
01:28:51,037 --> 01:28:54,006
We are going to the airport now.
- Okay.

896
01:28:54,674 --> 01:28:56,733
Azeem.
- Yes, sir.

897
01:28:56,910 --> 01:28:59,003
Mr. Tareeq has caIIed you downstairs.
- Okay, sir.

898
01:29:00,447 --> 01:29:01,539
Let's go.

899
01:29:28,341 --> 01:29:33,108
''Don't Iook at me with those
ruthIess eyes or I'II die.''

900
01:29:33,180 --> 01:29:37,048
''Oh, darIing, I wiII die.''

901
01:29:47,527 --> 01:29:48,926
Come on.

902
01:29:50,864 --> 01:29:52,263
Look over there.

903
01:29:57,404 --> 01:30:02,307
''Don't Iook at me with
such eyes. I wiII die.''

904
01:30:06,646 --> 01:30:08,614
''RuthIess eyes..''

905
01:30:15,088 --> 01:30:19,889
''My darIing, I wiII die.''

906
01:30:23,063 --> 01:30:25,156
Don't move. Don't move.

907
01:30:26,333 --> 01:30:29,234
Gun. Throw away the gun.
I wiII shoot him.

908
01:30:29,469 --> 01:30:30,959
TeII them or I wiII kiII you.

909
01:30:31,037 --> 01:30:32,436
Hey, throw away the guns.

910
01:30:33,573 --> 01:30:34,631
Step back. Step back.

911
01:30:34,708 --> 01:30:38,337
Rajeev. Rajeev. Go away from here.

912
01:30:38,511 --> 01:30:40,570
Go, Rajeev. Go.
- Hey, don't move.

913
01:30:40,647 --> 01:30:42,274
Rajeev, you go.

914
01:30:43,149 --> 01:30:45,583
Rajeev, go. I said go. Leave.

915
01:30:46,219 --> 01:30:48,414
Leave, Rajeev. Leave.

916
01:31:03,603 --> 01:31:07,130
Run, Rajeev. Run.

917
01:31:11,678 --> 01:31:13,703
Avatar Singh. Avatar Singh.

918
01:31:14,247 --> 01:31:15,544
Avatar Singh.

919
01:31:16,016 --> 01:31:18,280
What have you done?
He was my guest.

920
01:31:20,186 --> 01:31:23,451
And I.. am your master.

921
01:31:24,357 --> 01:31:27,190
Bring that rogue to me..

922
01:31:27,494 --> 01:31:32,329
..or be ready to see your
wife and kids' dead bodies. Go.

923
01:31:37,170 --> 01:31:39,570
Rajeev. What are you
staring at? TaIk to him.

924
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:45,200
HeIIo.
- Nargis. - Rajeev.

925
01:31:46,513 --> 01:31:48,572
Where are you?
- I am coming there.

926
01:31:49,316 --> 01:31:50,749
Have faith in me.

927
01:31:52,285 --> 01:31:54,253
I wiII never Ieave you aIone.

928
01:31:54,688 --> 01:31:58,351
I wiII definiteIy fuIfiII my promise.
You trust me, don't you?

929
01:31:59,359 --> 01:32:01,452
What's the use of these
assurances now, Rajeev?

930
01:32:03,697 --> 01:32:05,426
Your Nargis is soId.

931
01:32:07,801 --> 01:32:11,760
And after tomorrow night,
she won't be worth you either.

932
01:32:12,005 --> 01:32:13,404
She wiII be.

933
01:32:13,773 --> 01:32:16,173
Nargis wiII eventuaIIy be Rajeev's.

934
01:32:18,111 --> 01:32:21,012
Because it's been said,
it's been written..

935
01:32:21,247 --> 01:32:22,771
..that matches are made in heaven.

936
01:32:24,017 --> 01:32:28,215
And the matches made in
heaven don't break on earth.

937
01:32:30,690 --> 01:32:32,453
Now it is time to
remove every obstacIe..

938
01:32:32,525 --> 01:32:34,425
..and every enemy in the path.

939
01:32:35,562 --> 01:32:37,120
That's why I am going there.

940
01:32:38,531 --> 01:32:42,262
Wait for me.
Your Lord wiII save you.

941
01:32:49,809 --> 01:32:52,209
Give me the phone now. Come.

942
01:33:05,125 --> 01:33:06,387
Sir, sign..

943
01:33:25,278 --> 01:33:26,506
Second fIoor.

944
01:33:37,490 --> 01:33:38,787
Where is Babur?

945
01:33:43,396 --> 01:33:45,261
I wiII ask onIy once. Not again.

946
01:33:45,465 --> 01:33:46,625
Where is Babur?

947
01:34:32,612 --> 01:34:34,170
KiII me.

948
01:34:34,814 --> 01:34:38,910
Because in this game,
I am your cuIprit.

949
01:34:39,886 --> 01:34:42,184
I tried to kiII you.

950
01:34:42,789 --> 01:34:45,189
I betrayed my duty.

951
01:34:45,358 --> 01:34:47,258
Then why are you doing aII this?

952
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:51,724
Because.. Because Babur has
my wife and kids with him.

953
01:34:56,836 --> 01:34:58,929
PIease.. PIease kiII me.

954
01:34:59,272 --> 01:35:01,240
PIease kiII me.
- No.

955
01:35:01,608 --> 01:35:04,543
You can't make me a
cuIprit to hide your crimes.

956
01:35:05,845 --> 01:35:07,472
We wiII have to
think of something eIse.

957
01:35:26,598 --> 01:35:27,724
Mummy.

958
01:36:06,805 --> 01:36:09,831
My friend Tareeq Anwar.

959
01:36:11,543 --> 01:36:13,636
You are great.

960
01:36:13,812 --> 01:36:16,508
I had compIeteIy Iost hope.

961
01:36:16,982 --> 01:36:21,817
Look, Lakha,
when death stares at you..

962
01:36:21,954 --> 01:36:24,946
..even a poIiceman
turns into a terrorist .

963
01:36:26,758 --> 01:36:32,060
Leave him here and
you may go. Go.

964
01:36:32,130 --> 01:36:36,533
No, Babur. I got him
with great difficuIty.

965
01:36:37,469 --> 01:36:39,664
I won't Iet him go so easiIy.

966
01:36:40,105 --> 01:36:45,441
First reIease my wife and kids.
Then he wiII be yours.

967
01:36:46,878 --> 01:36:48,675
Of course.

968
01:36:50,716 --> 01:36:53,446
There's stiII some
honesty Ieft in us.

969
01:36:54,453 --> 01:36:57,183
Lakha, Ieave them.

970
01:37:07,766 --> 01:37:10,599
First send him this way and
then I'II send them that way.

971
01:37:30,222 --> 01:37:31,621
Father.

972
01:37:46,138 --> 01:37:47,537
Catch them.

973
01:37:52,611 --> 01:37:53,771
Come fast.

974
01:37:57,816 --> 01:37:59,044
Come.

975
01:38:17,636 --> 01:38:22,096
'In other news, aII the
major cities of Pakistan..

976
01:38:22,174 --> 01:38:25,041
..were set on high aIert..'

977
01:38:25,243 --> 01:38:28,303
'..when notorious
terrorist Babur AItaf Khan..'

978
01:38:28,647 --> 01:38:31,275
'..escaped after an
encounter with the poIice.'

979
01:38:31,516 --> 01:38:32,710
Yes. Did you find out anything?

980
01:38:33,585 --> 01:38:35,849
What do you mean? Find him.

981
01:38:35,921 --> 01:38:38,082
'If you get any information on Babur,
you can inform us on this number.'

982
01:38:38,156 --> 01:38:40,954
'Babar targets onIy
those who are cIose to you..'

983
01:38:41,293 --> 01:38:46,629
'..the ones you Iove.'
- '3004000321.'

984
01:38:48,834 --> 01:38:50,597
I know where Babar
wouId be right now.

985
01:38:52,871 --> 01:38:55,135
What do you know?
I know everything.

986
01:38:55,207 --> 01:38:56,936
I did everything.

987
01:38:58,009 --> 01:39:00,705
Everything goes on here. - I'II see
you Iater. - Why are you Iaughing?

988
01:39:00,779 --> 01:39:03,247
FooIish girI.
- Where is Nargis?

989
01:39:04,116 --> 01:39:05,981
There's no one here as weII.

990
01:39:06,251 --> 01:39:09,812
I think Mr. Nawaz gave
aII his servants a hoIiday.

991
01:39:09,988 --> 01:39:12,582
For you, he has made sure that
there's no one in the mansion.

992
01:39:13,725 --> 01:39:15,556
You reaIIy made him wait a Iot.

993
01:39:17,162 --> 01:39:26,764
''Not everyone is
worthy of your Iips..''

994
01:39:27,305 --> 01:39:33,904
''Everyone has come here for
you after aII the destruction.''

995
01:39:33,979 --> 01:39:35,776
Come on.

996
01:39:37,582 --> 01:39:47,787
''We have reached our destination.''

997
01:39:47,859 --> 01:39:53,195
''Everyone has come here for
you after aII the destruction.

998
01:40:00,806 --> 01:40:03,832
Sadiq? What are you doing here?

999
01:40:03,909 --> 01:40:05,672
You were supposed to come with us.

1000
01:40:05,944 --> 01:40:07,411
Where is Mr. Nawaz?

1001
01:40:26,998 --> 01:40:30,900
The patient suffering from
Iove has just given up his Iife.

1002
01:40:32,838 --> 01:40:36,274
The doctor came too Iate.

1003
01:40:51,923 --> 01:40:53,015
HeIIo.

1004
01:40:53,091 --> 01:40:55,651
By switching on the
Ioud-speaker of the mobiIe..

1005
01:40:55,727 --> 01:40:58,753
..you did a smart thing,
Tareeq Anwar.

1006
01:40:59,397 --> 01:41:02,298
What's going on?
- Now Iisten to me..

1007
01:41:03,034 --> 01:41:06,765
..and aIso teII that smart
aIeck Rocky. - No, Rajeev.

1008
01:41:06,838 --> 01:41:09,739
Don't come here.
Your Iife is in danger.

1009
01:41:15,146 --> 01:41:18,274
If you did it again,
I wiII break your teeth..

1010
01:41:18,350 --> 01:41:20,818
..and make your Iife miserabIe.

1011
01:41:23,288 --> 01:41:25,722
Now you have two choices.

1012
01:41:26,157 --> 01:41:31,060
Give me that singer and save
three of your compatriots.

1013
01:41:32,063 --> 01:41:36,090
Or eIse, save his Iife
and take the dead bodies..

1014
01:41:36,167 --> 01:41:38,931
..of these three fooIs from here.

1015
01:41:40,972 --> 01:41:43,839
Now the decision is in your hands.

1016
01:41:45,043 --> 01:41:50,140
Send him to us by handcuffing him.

1017
01:41:51,750 --> 01:41:53,445
And that, too, aIone.

1018
01:41:54,085 --> 01:41:56,349
Not with your cronies.

1019
01:41:57,923 --> 01:41:59,390
You have onIy one hour.

1020
01:42:02,093 --> 01:42:05,790
No, no. I have aIready
made this mistake once.

1021
01:42:06,331 --> 01:42:10,768
I won't do it again..
- You don't have too much time..

1022
01:42:15,140 --> 01:42:17,472
Sadiq.
- Aunty..

1023
01:42:22,380 --> 01:42:23,506
Sadiq.

1024
01:42:26,017 --> 01:42:31,319
Think about it. One's down.
Now two more women are Ieft.

1025
01:42:32,991 --> 01:42:35,858
And you have onIy 57 minutes.

1026
01:42:38,163 --> 01:42:43,499
Tick-tock. Tick-tock. Tick-tock.

1027
01:42:43,935 --> 01:42:51,842
Tick-tock. Tick-tock. Tick-tock.

1028
01:42:52,911 --> 01:42:55,471
I can't do this. This is not right.

1029
01:42:55,547 --> 01:42:57,378
Yes, I know it's not right.

1030
01:42:58,516 --> 01:43:00,916
But he hasn't Ieft
any other way for us.

1031
01:43:02,053 --> 01:43:06,922
To save my Iife,
I can't risk theirs.

1032
01:43:07,892 --> 01:43:11,293
I am going. - I won't Iet you
commit suicide tiII I am aIive.

1033
01:43:11,363 --> 01:43:12,955
Do you understand?

1034
01:43:13,198 --> 01:43:18,329
If I stiII worry about this Iife,
then shame on such a Iife.

1035
01:43:20,572 --> 01:43:22,369
Think about it again.

1036
01:43:23,908 --> 01:43:25,398
Handcuff me.

1037
01:44:04,516 --> 01:44:08,475
My mother..
used to teII me a story..

1038
01:44:08,553 --> 01:44:10,953
..in which a king's Iife
was hidden in a parrot.

1039
01:44:11,523 --> 01:44:14,720
I used to think that the
oIdie was taIking aII rubbish.

1040
01:44:15,560 --> 01:44:18,461
A human's Iife in a parrot?

1041
01:44:19,030 --> 01:44:27,165
Today I understood that you are
the parrot and he.. is the king.

1042
01:44:29,207 --> 01:44:33,576
If I strangIe the parrot,
the king wiII die.

1043
01:44:34,879 --> 01:44:38,076
End of the story. Worth the money.

1044
01:44:39,451 --> 01:44:41,146
But what a great pair!

1045
01:44:41,753 --> 01:44:45,484
One is a dancer and
the other is a singer.

1046
01:44:45,990 --> 01:44:49,653
And in the middIe, there
is this brotheI manager.

1047
01:44:50,028 --> 01:44:51,825
A broker.

1048
01:44:51,896 --> 01:44:53,625
Mind your Ianguage, Babur.

1049
01:44:54,165 --> 01:44:55,996
Whoever she is,
she is a woman first.

1050
01:44:57,802 --> 01:44:59,064
I am in front of you.

1051
01:44:59,704 --> 01:45:02,229
Keep your word and Iet them go.

1052
01:45:02,640 --> 01:45:07,509
Shut up.
- No.

1053
01:45:11,015 --> 01:45:14,678
My eyes yearned for a
Iong time to see this sight.

1054
01:45:16,020 --> 01:45:17,954
BIood on your shirt.

1055
01:45:20,725 --> 01:45:25,025
It feeIs so great.

1056
01:45:26,531 --> 01:45:32,060
Do you remember how you
shot SuItan in the chest?

1057
01:45:32,637 --> 01:45:35,071
Do you remember? Do you remember?

1058
01:45:35,273 --> 01:45:36,831
Do you remember?

1059
01:45:36,941 --> 01:45:39,466
Now I wiII bathe in your bIood.

1060
01:45:40,745 --> 01:45:44,613
I wiII take your shirt
to my heaven.

1061
01:45:48,686 --> 01:45:50,916
An eye for an eye.
- Nargis.

1062
01:45:50,989 --> 01:45:53,480
And a Iife for a Iife.

1063
01:46:12,277 --> 01:46:14,142
Come on. Shoot.

1064
01:46:16,648 --> 01:46:17,979
Shoot. Break it.

1065
01:46:24,322 --> 01:46:25,721
Rajeev.

1066
01:47:32,657 --> 01:47:36,115
Now you Ieave my hand.

1067
01:47:36,628 --> 01:47:39,222
It's my time to die.

1068
01:47:39,697 --> 01:47:42,222
You can't die so easiIy
without getting your punishment.

1069
01:47:42,367 --> 01:47:45,063
Who is afraid of death?
If Babur is afraid of something..

1070
01:47:45,136 --> 01:47:48,196
..it is to face his mother.

1071
01:47:48,940 --> 01:47:51,738
I pity my Iife.

1072
01:47:52,210 --> 01:47:54,906
I didn't keep my word.

1073
01:47:55,046 --> 01:47:59,415
I pity my Iife.

1074
01:48:38,323 --> 01:48:41,451
''Ever since I..''

1075
01:48:44,429 --> 01:48:50,129
''..Iooked into your eyes.''

1076
01:48:52,570 --> 01:48:57,701
''My dear, I feII in Iove with you.''

1077
01:48:58,376 --> 01:49:02,335
''Oh, speIIbinding beauty.
SpeIIbinding beauty.''

1078
01:49:02,413 --> 01:49:08,045
May 'AIIah' give every girI in
'Heera Mandi' a Rajeev Iike you.

1079
01:49:08,119 --> 01:49:10,644
''Oh, speIIbinding beauty.
SpeIIbinding beauty.''

1080
01:49:10,722 --> 01:49:16,058
''SpeIIbinding beauty.
SpeIIbinding beauty.''

1081
01:49:16,527 --> 01:49:22,090
''SpeIIbinding beauty.

1082
01:49:22,433 --> 01:49:28,372
''SpeIIbinding beauty.

1083
01:49:28,706 --> 01:49:34,542
''SpeIIbinding beauty.
SpeIIbinding beauty.''

1084
01:49:34,746 --> 01:49:41,049
''SpeIIbinding beauty.
SpeIIbinding beauty.''

1085
01:49:57,001 --> 01:49:59,526
''KohI..''

1086
01:50:02,173 --> 01:50:04,903
''KohI..''

1087
01:50:07,545 --> 01:50:10,070
''KohI.. KohI.. KohI..''

1088
01:50:10,148 --> 01:50:12,742
''KohI.. KohI.. KohI..''

1089
01:50:12,817 --> 01:50:17,550
''KohI.. KohI.. KohI-Iined eyes.''

1090
01:50:17,922 --> 01:50:20,618
''KohI.. KohI.. KohI..''

1091
01:50:20,691 --> 01:50:23,125
''KohI.. KohI.. KohI..''

1092
01:50:23,194 --> 01:50:28,029
''KohI.. KohI.. KohI-Iined eyes.''

1093
01:50:28,499 --> 01:50:30,592
''Yeah, everybody, come on.''

1094
01:50:31,035 --> 01:50:32,195
''Rock it!''

1095
01:50:32,437 --> 01:50:34,462
''Move it now.''

1096
01:50:35,506 --> 01:50:36,905
''Come on just do it.''

1097
01:50:36,974 --> 01:50:40,535
''Yes. Right now. I want to
see you move your body.''

1098
01:50:40,711 --> 01:50:42,906
''I want to have a good time.''

1099
01:50:43,548 --> 01:50:44,742
''Come on now.''

1100
01:50:44,816 --> 01:50:47,216
''Bring it on now. Bring it on now.''

1101
01:50:47,552 --> 01:50:49,520
''Bring it. Bring it.
Bring it down now.''

1102
01:50:49,587 --> 01:50:52,055
''KohI.. KohI.. KohI..''

1103
01:50:52,123 --> 01:50:54,717
''KohI.. KohI.. KohI..''

01:50:54,792 --> 01:50:59,161
''KohI.. KohI.. KohI-Iined eyes.''

01:50:59,964 --> 01:51:02,558
''KohI.. KohI.. KohI..''

1106
01:51:02,633 --> 01:51:05,124
''KohI.. KohI.. KohI..''

1107
01:51:05,203 --> 01:51:09,799
''KohI.. KohI.. KohI-Iined eyes.''

1108
01:51:10,241 --> 01:51:12,835
''They are making me go crazy..''

1109
01:51:12,910 --> 01:51:15,674
''They are making me
go crazy for sure.''

1110
01:51:15,746 --> 01:51:18,214
''KohI.. KohI.. KohI..''

1111
01:51:18,282 --> 01:51:20,910
''KohI.. KohI.. KohI..''

''Bring it on now. Bring it on now.''

1130
01:52:11,302 --> 01:52:13,827
''Bring it. Bring it.
Bring it down now.''

1131
01:52:13,905 --> 01:52:18,638
''There is a diIemma

1132
01:52:18,910 --> 01:52:25,679
''I'm heIpIess

1133
01:52:26,350 --> 01:52:29,547

1134
01:52:29,620 --> 01:52:32,145
''I got robbed at first sight.''

1135
01:52:32,223 --> 01:52:34,657
