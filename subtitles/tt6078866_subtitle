1
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:48,274
Hey!

2
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:49,734
Hey, you!

3
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,277
Hey, hottie!

4
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:55,657
Love the way you move.

5
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,074
Hey!

6
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,162
Got a problem?

7
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:02,914
I'm just walking.

8
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,958
Why are you trailing me like a dog?

9
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,877
Who's trailing?
You're the one leading me.

10
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:11,798
Back off, or I'll beat
the living daylights out of you.

11
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:12,881
Oh, really?

12
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:16,261
Too hot, aren't you?
Come a little closer.

13
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:18,263
Why not ask your mum?
She'll warm you up good.

14
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,306
Dirty cunt!

15
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,436
Soni, let go of him!

16
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:26,479
Sorry.

17
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:27,564
Forgive me.

18
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,316
Cut it out!

19
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,318
You pig!

20
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,908
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

21
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:52,630
- What's taking so long?
- The man got hurt.

22
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,883
Get his statement,
but you're not to use force!

23
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,176
Takes two to turn them into crybabies.

24
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,012
- Soni.
- Yes, madam?

25
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,513
Come here.

26
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,473
Dismissed.

27
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,604
We agreed on something, right?

28
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,317
What were your orders?

29
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,653
Madam, this one went too far.

30
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,740
So why even bother with the protocols?

31
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,204
Go sit in the car.

32
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:26,956
Yessir.

33
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:35,839
Let's clear out.

34
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:54,525
Why are we stopping?

35
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:57,070
Nothing, I'll just walk home from here.

36
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:59,030
Why? We'll drop you off.

37
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:03,243
I'll just buy some milk and be on my way.

38
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:06,537
Let Govind get it.
I want to have a word with you.

39
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,831
What all shall I get, madam?

40
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:11,376
A quart of milk,
and a packet of sweet bread.

41
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,514
What got into you today?

42
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:29,686
Madam, the way he lunged at me,
pushed me too far.

43
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:34,357
I know it gets rough in self-defense,

44
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,818
but what you did today
was way out of bounds.

45
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:39,946
Madam...

46
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,573
believe me, one has to do as much.

47
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,659
Don't rationalize it now.

48
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:50,290
What if he had a weapon on him?

49
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,181
What if something would've
happened to you?

50
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,966
Don't you think you were being reckless?

51
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,476
Madam, I'll get going then.

52
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,687
Do think about what I said.

53
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:15,273
Yessir.

54
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,447
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

55
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:27,405
Soni.

56
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,324
Use your clips when you line dry.

57
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,743
They were strewn all over my patio.

58
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,328
Thank you, Mrs. Huma.

59
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,373
This shirt has been lying there for ages.

60
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,960
It's better off over there.

61
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,171
You should calm down.

62
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,923
I'm laying them all on your bed.

63
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:47,425
Sure.

64
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:07,737
What happened?

65
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:10,113
What happened?

66
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,783
- Seems like my gas cylinder ran out.
- Oh, no.

67
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:16,162
Don't worry, I can ask my husband
to arrange one for you.

68
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,457
- No, I'll manage.
- Oh, he won't mind.

69
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,126
You didn't eat last night?

70
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:26,714
Don't worry.
I'll just microwave it later.

71
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,258
You always have an answer to everything.

72
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,885
I should probably go.

73
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,429
Don't want the
husband to be late for work.

74
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,723
Let me know if you need anything.

75
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,266
Thanks.

76
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:39,810
- Listen.
- Yeah?

77
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:43,189
I've been meaning to ask you,
have you called Naveen yet?

78
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,400
Can we not talk about this?

79
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,278
All right.

80
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:00,456
Thank you, Mr. Singh.

81
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,333
Yes.

82
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,795
Crime branch. Yes.

83
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,715
About to have my breakfast.

84
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:13,594
- Khushboo.
- Yes, madam?

85
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,180
- Could you bring me a glass of water?
- Yes, madam.

86
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,725
The missus is doing all right.

87
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,436
Working night-shifts these days.

88
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,938
Khushboo!

89
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,275
How is Nishu doing?

90
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:28,943
Good?

91
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:33,698
Hello, Mom.

92
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:36,450
- You're home?
- Yes.

93
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,036
- How are you?
- Fine.

94
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,120
All well?

95
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:43,958
- Has Sandeep left for work?
- Not yet. He's on the phone.

96
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,251
Okay.

97
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:49,380
- Has the sun come out yet?
- Yes.

98
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:51,716
- I want to get some sunshine today.
- Sure.

99
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:54,969
Give me your hand.

100
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,638
Oh, Lord!

101
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,099
Kalpana...

102
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:02,393
please change your
strange work-hours, dear.

103
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,145
Enough of this graveyard shift.

104
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:07,481
I wish, but I have a lot to do.

105
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:11,777
I don't care.
Delegate to your staff then!

106
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,405
What’s the point of having authority?

107
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:16,616
Let me tell you...

108
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,410
your father-in-law was a
devoted officer like no other,

109
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:24,540
but, there wasn't a day
when he wasn't home for dinner.

110
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,336
What I mean is,
you have responsibilities at home as well.

111
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:33,215
What is so funny?
Am I a jester or what?

112
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:35,635
How long will this madness go on?

113
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,430
You arrive and he leaves,
it's a never-ending cycle.

114
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:40,765
Like hide and seek.

115
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,183
All right, just relax.

116
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:46,854
Have you two no sense
of commitment to family?

117
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:50,232
Mother, I know you're hungry.
Have some breakfast.

118
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,568
Yes, don't get smart with me.

119
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,237
Khushboo! Bring another plate for Mom.

120
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,157
Now that you’ve been promoted

121
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:00,785
see if you can get
her the day shift assigned.

122
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:34,151
- Sir, she's lying, I did nothing wrong.
- Sir, this man molested me.

123
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:37,738
One at a time, please.
Madam, calm down.

124
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,698
Sir, you must arrest this liar!

125
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,034
One person at a time.
Please, madam!

126
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:45,204
- This man is a liar and a pervert...
- Silence!

127
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,331
You do realize you're at
a police station, right?

128
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:48,916
Don't create a scene!

129
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:53,254
Attach that medical report here.

130
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,590
- Sir, he's lying...
- Keep it down, will you?

131
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,185
- What's the matter?
- Let me explain, madam.

132
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,012
- He forced himself into my house...
- Madam, she's lying...

133
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,181
Everyone calm down and step back!

134
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,308
- Stay behind that line.
- Step back! All of you!

135
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,977
Behind that line.

136
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,231
- May I have your name, madam?
- Neeru.

137
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:14,316
Tell us exactly what happened.

138
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,653
As I was saying, he forced himself
into my house and attacked me...

139
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,029
Is he an acquaintance?

140
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,407
- He's our landlord.
- Madam, I...

141
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,242
- Your name, sir?
- Madam, believe me...

142
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:24,452
Your name!

143
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,370
Vishwanath.

144
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:29,957
Tell me what happened.

145
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:32,001
So, we've been his tenants for years.

146
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,961
It all started with him raising our rent.

147
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:36,839
I told him I'm already
struggling to make ends meet.

148
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:40,092
So, he offered to let us off
only if I sleep with him.

149
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,260
I never said that!

150
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,013
When I refused, he forced himself
into my house...

151
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,431
You depraved son of a bitch!

152
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:46,515
Silence!

153
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:49,685
Do not utter a sound
unless I ask you a question.

154
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:52,980
Yes, go on.

155
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,150
He threw himself on me and groped me.

156
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,401
I see.

157
00:12:57,526 --> 00:13:00,154
- What about this man here?
- He is my husband.

158
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,908
- May I have your name, sir?
- Tilukaat.

159
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,243
Anyone else in the family besides you two?

160
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,078
We have a son.

161
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,290
- Was he at home?
- No, he was at school.

162
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,794
- And you?
- I was at the farmers' market.

163
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,130
Who called the emergency number?

164
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,965
Madam, I did.

165
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:21,509
I see.

166
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:24,178
When did you do it?

167
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:25,888
When I got back home

168
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,098
I saw this man forcing himself on my wife.

169
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,308
I never once...

170
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:33,062
You think I'm blind?
I caught you red-handed, bastard!

171
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,980
Enough of all this shouting!

172
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:38,359
If anyone shouts or cuts in again,
I'm throwing you all in the cell.

173
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:42,101
So you called the police. Then?

174
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:46,075
When I walked in, I saw
my wife resisting this man

175
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,036
and without wasting a second,
I called the police, madam.

176
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,372
I see. You may speak now, sir.

177
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:55,125
Madam, I've rented out a
small portion of my land to them.

178
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,462
- However...
- Where do you live?

179
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,215
In the same neighborhood.

180
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:06,428
Now, they've occupied
a much larger area than I had allotted.

181
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:10,140
He's making up stories.
He just wants to kick us out.

182
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:13,060
Miss, you've had your chance.
Please don’t interrupt.

183
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:16,814
When I told them I'll raise the rent,
this man turned hostile.

184
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:20,442
And this lady followed me
all the way to my house

185
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,069
creating a scene in the neighborhood.

186
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:25,322
Look, what this monster did to me, madam!

187
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:27,700
Do you still think I'm lying?

188
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,285
Please cover yourself.

189
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,747
- I asked for the medical report, man.
- Madam, we have a lot more to tell you.

190
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,499
Yes, I'm listening. Be patient.

191
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:41,463
- What about your family, sir?
- Madam, I have a wife and a daughter.

192
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,842
Madam, this man isn't the
real owner of the land either.

193
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:48,721
He leased it from the government,
with no permit to rent it out.

194
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:51,557
Madam, I've had it for years now.

195
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,642
Renting helps with
the income for my household.

196
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,746
- Believe me, I have done nothing wrong.
- "Nothing wrong"? What a sick man!

197
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,064
He wants to steal a poor woman's home

198
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,150
and has assaulted her
in front of her husband.

199
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,569
- Keep it down, please.
- No, I won't keep it down!

200
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:06,572
I demand that you
arrest this man immediately!

201
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,574
Do not tell me how to do my job!

202
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,076
Sir, where did you say you were?

203
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,245
Farmers' market.

204
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,623
Since when do we have a
farmers' market on a Saturday?

205
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,960
Don't fool me with your theatrics.
I want everyone out!

206
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:24,131
- But, madam, we were saying...
- I don't want to hear another word!

207
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:26,175
Go sit outside, all of you.

208
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,052
Come on, move it!

209
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,513
No tea today?

210
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,307
Let me ask someone.

211
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,559
What do I do with them?

212
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:38,270
Clearly, the lady is
making up a false case.

213
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:41,607
The whole fuss is about the land.

214
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,443
See if you can broker a deal between them.

215
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:45,653
Okay.

216
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:53,595
The independent witness
wasn't even at the scene

217
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,371
so how can he give a statement?

218
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:59,875
Sir, if we're the only witnesses,
the case may seem weak.

219
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,086
I don't care! This is not the way.

220
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,684
See what's written
in the man's medical report.

221
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:28,028
Disgraceful.

222
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,076
What was the commotion
with that lady all about?

223
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:38,414
- Madam, it was a land-related dispute.
- What?

224
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,874
The whole uproar was about the rent.

225
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,169
So, why was her blouse ripped?
Show me the formal complaint.

226
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:48,465
Madam, it was all an act.

227
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,134
A total farce.

228
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,761
Just some bickering
with the landlord over rent.

229
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,390
I didn't know we were
running a tribunal here!

230
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,106
Soni, do you ever follow what I say?

231
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:14,175
Chauhan, call that woman again.
I want a proper complaint filed.

232
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,162
Yes?

233
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,581
I see.

234
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,794
Okay, let's dispatch one constable.

235
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,172
Send someone levelheaded.

236
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,257
They're poor folks,
deal with them sensibly.

237
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:33,718
Okay.

238
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,014
Come on, blow into the tube!

239
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,432
Properly!

240
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:43,896
Mister, don't inhale!
You're supposed to blow into the tube!

241
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:45,230
Come on!

242
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:49,276
Make it quick! Get his reading,
and impound his vehicle.

243
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,359
Yes, madam.

244
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,988
Stand up straight, fatso.

245
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,491
Why is this car in the middle of the road?

246
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,451
Pull to the curb!

247
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,746
Come on, beat it!

248
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:05,417
Officer, take him into custody.

249
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,796
Madam, let me know
if you want a cup of tea.

250
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:11,298
There's hardly time to breathe,
let alone have tea.

251
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,403
Madam, can you please look into this?

252
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,280
What's the matter?

253
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,450
They're drinking in the car,
and refusing to step out.

254
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,245
This vehicle?

255
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:43,914
- How many are they?
- Two.

256
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,127
What's all the fuss about?

257
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,255
They are clearly intoxicated,
and not cooperating.

258
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:52,422
Oh boy!

259
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:53,966
Sir, roll down the window, please.

260
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:56,135
- Your ID, please.
- What?

261
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,427
Let's see some ID.

262
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:01,056
I am Lt. Commander Vikram Rathore.
Indian Navy.

263
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,600
Very good, sir.
Let's see your ID.

264
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:06,728
Madam, please teach this man some manners.

265
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:09,273
He's just doing his job, sir.
Your ID, please.

266
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:12,234
You know what?
We need women like you in the Navy.

267
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:17,012
The ID doesn't have my cell number.

268
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,326
Sir, your ID.

269
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,120
Show it, man!
What the fuck!

270
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,171
Had a little too much today, sir?

271
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,798
It's my birthday,
and tomorrow I'm getting married.

272
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:35,924
I see.

273
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,051
We're celebrating my bachelor party.

274
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,470
Sure, we'll celebrate it together.
Out of the car, please.

275
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:43,140
- Why, hop right in! Let's have a drink.
- Oh boy!

276
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:44,975
Let's get him tested.

277
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,688
Sir, please step out of the car.

278
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,190
Listen! Madam!

279
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,775
- Come on!
- Out of the car, please.

280
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,486
Listen, shithead! Stay back.

281
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,531
- Don't wag your finger at me.
- I'm not even talking to you.

282
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,491
I'm asking politely, please step outside...

283
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:05,579
Stop calling out to her.

284
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,958
You need to step out.

285
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,631
- Back off! Don't touch me, you pig!
- Stop wagging your finger.

286
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:18,425
Nope, I'm not talking to you.

287
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,262
Please, step out.

288
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:25,307
- Listen...
- You need to step out of the car, sir.

289
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,101
Listen, I've been polite so far,
but now I’m losing my patience.

290
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:35,525
- I'm telling you...
- Step outside, sir.

291
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,653
Out of the car, please.

292
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,508
- Sir, you're being very stubborn...
- No, you're not listening to me...

293
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:44,743
We're just doing our job.

294
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,080
Sir, this is wrong...

295
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,669
Sober now?

296
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,046
What do you think you're doing?

297
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,006
Arrogant swine!

298
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,050
Madam, calm down, please.

299
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:03,095
Hey, you! Put that phone away!

300
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:08,225
Please pull yourself together.

301
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,392
Madam, please.

302
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,686
Madam...

303
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:14,273
They are the Navy for heaven's sake.
People are recording us on their phones.

304
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:16,149
I'll gun her down!

305
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:19,152
Relax, madam.
You don't want a scandal here.

306
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,780
Hand me the bloody gun!

307
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:49,683
You're out of breath.

308
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:52,102
These damn stairs!

309
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,229
Why did you take the trouble?

310
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:56,148
Don't worry about me.

311
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:59,568
Cooking for friends is no trouble at all.

312
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:04,614
What is this? Did you not eat last night?

313
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:06,742
I did.

314
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,368
You barely had two pieces of bread.

315
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:12,080
You work so hard and barely eat anything.

316
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:17,044
This is convenient, isn't it?
Toss them in the machine and done.

317
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,861
And here I'm dealing with
backaches after handwashing a load.

318
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,133
You're welcome to wash them here.

319
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:25,552
I've never trusted a machine wash.

320
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:30,515
Nothing like scrubbing and
wringing with your own hands.

321
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,403
- Tell me something.
- Yes?

322
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,614
Your name has been
popping up a lot this morning.

323
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,617
My husband was
on a call with another officer

324
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:50,511
and your name was
mentioned quite a few times.

325
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:51,995
Did something happen?

326
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,997
It's nothing.

327
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:56,416
A man misbehaved with me, that's all.

328
00:22:58,293 --> 00:22:59,503
May I suggest something?

329
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:02,130
Start applying <i>Sindoor</i> on your forehead.

330
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,466
When I attended sewing school

331
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,052
I remember having to pass
through this ghetto.

332
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:11,139
There were men who'd ogle me shamelessly.

333
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:13,850
One day I decided to apply <i>Sindoor...</i>

334
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:16,269
even though our religion
does not permit it.

335
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:20,023
But, guess what? No more stares!

336
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,193
Are you even listening?

337
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:26,363
Don't just nod! Take my advice...

338
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,199
and say goodbye to your worries.
Forever.

339
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,786
Tell me, would you like
to have some green tea?

340
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:34,830
You call that tea?

341
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:38,250
Thanks, but no thanks to your green tea.

342
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,460
There's neither flavor, nor color.

343
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:45,382
What's this?
Why not cover the windows completely?

344
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:48,552
- One can see everything from outside.
- Who cares?

345
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:51,555
Crazy girl! Have some sense.

346
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:56,184
Hey, Soni!

347
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,853
Listen.

348
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,355
Naveen is here.

349
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,482
I just saw him through the window.

350
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,028
Listen!

351
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:08,572
Look at me.

352
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:10,532
Let go of your bitterness.

353
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:13,451
Naveen is on his way up.
You two have to talk to each other.

354
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,078
Enough is enough.

355
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,707
- I'll see you later.
- Please stay for a little while.

356
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:22,085
No way. I can't stay.

357
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:27,841
Hello, Mrs. Huma.

358
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,968
- Where have you been?
- How are you?

359
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:33,305
It's been over two months
since I last saw you.

360
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,473
Just been busy with work.

361
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:39,269
Don't make excuses! She shouldn't
have to manage the house on her own.

362
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:42,981
Well, I'm here now.

363
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:44,900
Alright. Go see her now.

364
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,110
- You take care.
- Okay.

365
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:05,086
How have you been?

366
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:12,510
I stopped by last night,
but the door was locked.

367
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:20,268
I figured that you're probably
still doing night shifts.

368
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:34,324
Listen, I...

369
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:37,410
I brought you something.

370
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:39,496
No shoes in the kitchen!

371
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:43,500
Sorry, I just wanted to show you these.

372
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:48,129
- I want nothing from your shop.
- They're not from my shop!

373
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,215
I actually bought these for you.

374
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:55,470
It's so hot in here.

375
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:01,476
Is that your lunch on the table?

376
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,562
Better have it while it's hot.

377
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:05,813
I will.

378
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:08,400
Okay, I'll get you
some water with your food.

379
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:12,946
- Shoes!
- I'm sorry.

380
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:15,490
I totally forgot.

381
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,325
I'll take them off.

382
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,301
Don't bother.

383
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:36,802
Why?

384
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:48,273
Sorry, I forgot that you like
warm water with your food.

385
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:52,152
- Move your bag, please.
- Yes, of course.

386
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,572
Warm water is actually
very good for the body.

387
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,582
What were you doing in
the Civil Lines area yesterday?

388
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:09,210
- Yesterday?
- Yes, last night.

389
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:11,254
Saw you on your bike with a constable.

390
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:12,714
Oh, him!

391
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:17,302
He keeps calling me for advice.
Wants me to find a buyer for his flat.

392
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:19,346
I'm so sick of him.

393
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,514
Wait a minute.

394
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,351
You were at that checkpoint?

395
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:28,021
I see!
That's where the scuffle broke out.

396
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:39,157
- Why are you here, Naveen?
- I'm just here to talk.

397
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,537
Are you done yet?

398
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,388
Good morning, sir.

399
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:08,144
Can I click another, sir?

400
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:12,190
- Was that not good?
- It was okay. A backup, just in case?

401
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:15,527
I have work to get back to.
You have what you need.

402
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:18,154
Hi.

403
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:24,369
How's the new office?

404
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:26,413
So far so good.

405
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:32,210
- Two cups of tea, please.
- No, Sandeep. It's not necessary at all.

406
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:34,421
Try it. You'll like it.

407
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,425
Shall we sit over there?

408
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:40,135
Don't be so formal.

409
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,016
How was your meeting
with the Commissioner?

410
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:49,227
It went well.

411
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:52,397
He wants to invite us over for dinner.

412
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:54,983
I told him I'll have to ask my girl.

413
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:11,332
The new office is
looking great, by the way.

414
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,419
Yeah, the paint is
still fresh on the walls.

415
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:17,547
- The smell is annoying you, isn't it?
- Just a little.

416
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,098
So...

417
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:31,394
did he have anything to say
about the altercation at the checkpoint?

418
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,522
He is obviously upset.

419
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:38,610
There will be disciplinary action.

420
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,948
We'll have the official word
in a couple of hours.

421
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,500
I am also to blame.

422
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:57,045
I yelled at her in the team meeting.

423
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:00,507
I'll tell you what you're guilty of.

424
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,342
You're too softhearted.

425
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:06,054
You should've seen me
lash out at her in front of everyone.

426
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:08,848
You pamper your team too much.

427
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,726
That's why they behave this way.

428
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:14,813
Why in my 15 years of service,
has no one ever dared stir up trouble?

429
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:17,982
Sandeep, she's going through a
rough patch in her personal life as well.

430
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:21,820
So, that's another problem.

431
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,657
You start making these
personal connections with people.

432
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:29,410
Don't get swayed by emotions.

433
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:34,749
Anyway, don't waste
your time overthinking this.

434
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:38,211
You live and you learn.

435
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:49,681
By the way, those officers
were completely wasted.

436
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:52,100
Which gives the police
the right to flog them?

437
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:55,311
No, manhandling them
was definitely uncalled for.

438
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:56,771
But...

439
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:09,242
This had nothing to do
with the decoy operations, sir.

440
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:14,497
Understood, sir.
I'm sorry.

441
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:18,293
Yes, sir.

442
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:19,711
You have a good day.

443
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,813
Why sorry now?

444
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:47,864
You're having to answer for my mistake.

445
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:51,576
It's only appropriate,
since you report to me.

446
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,459
But it's not!

447
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:01,586
You shouldn't have to
answer for my actions.

448
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:04,005
If only things worked that way, Soni.

449
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,149
Will this impact our operation?

450
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,072
I called you here

451
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:31,741
to inform you about
your transfer to the Control Room.

452
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,871
You start tomorrow.
An inquiry has been ordered.

453
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:53,638
Madam, as long as you know
all the facts, I'm fine.

454
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:13,074
You know, when I was in eighth grade

455
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:18,162
I saw this young man getting
publicly flogged by three policemen.

456
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,666
The man was howling in pain.

457
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,377
But the three policemen
clubbed him until he passed out.

458
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:32,176
I later found out that he had been
stalking girls from my school.

459
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:40,935
But the howling still
made me sick to my stomach.

460
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:00,371
Daddy's turn.

461
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,295
Stop feeding her cherries.

462
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:18,139
- Now it's my turn.
- Watch out! Make way for Uncle.

463
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,603
Come over, Kalpana.

464
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:25,938
Happy birthday, dear.
God bless you, child.

465
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,698
Happy birthday, dear niece!

466
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:39,952
That's how it's done!

467
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:42,288
Nishu, that's enough!

468
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:44,123
Enough, Nishu!

469
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:50,797
I wonder where the maid has flown off to.

470
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:55,009
These people can be
such slackers sometimes.

471
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:59,347
You and Nishu are the perfect Capricorns!

472
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:01,474
Picking up after others.

473
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:15,363
I think... you turned 30 this year, right?

474
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,202
So...

475
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:26,707
Any decisions yet?

476
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,127
When are you planning your first one?

477
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:32,547
I haven't really given it a thought.

478
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:35,007
You should.

479
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,968
You should decide soon.

480
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:39,512
There's no point in delaying, you know.

481
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,348
You know...

482
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:48,354
I have a friend who's a gynecologist.
I'll give you her number.

483
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:52,692
She's quite helpful.
In case you need help.

484
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,612
You do want one, right?

485
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,114
Mom!

486
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:02,076
Mom, don't forget to
pack some cake for school.

487
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,288
- There's more than enough.
- Nice dress, niece!

488
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,917
Nishu!

489
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,879
You need to stop
calling Kalpana by her first name.

490
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:14,964
She's "Aunt Kalpana."
Be polite to your aunt.

491
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:16,883
I'm not calling her "Aunt!"

492
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:20,970
Now please go change.
Or else you'll spoil your dress.

493
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:25,433
Aunt and niece always play
on the same team, Mother.

494
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:28,144
I don't mind the fun and games.
But I wonder

495
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:30,521
when is she going to
play with her own little one?

496
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,064
You must counsel her.

497
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:34,150
It'll happen when it's supposed to happen.

498
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,818
Don't worry!

499
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:38,070
I wish I could stop worrying.

500
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:42,074
Wise is the one who follows
the advice of the elderly.

501
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,619
Don't forget, the body clock is ticking.

502
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,370
One must act before time runs out.

503
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:49,498
Why are you all standing there?
Your tea is getting cold.

504
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:52,043
Yes, let's go.
You need to get some rest, Mom.

505
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:54,045
Yes, I'm going.

506
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:58,299
It's my duty to advise,
but to each his own.

507
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,218
My words fall on deaf ears.

508
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:03,387
That's enough.

509
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:06,766
- Are you going to pour the whole thing?
- Carry on, my man! Drink up.

510
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,978
Look who's here!
Welcome, Sir Kalpana.

511
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:14,106
We're in luck today!

512
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,692
To be able to steal some of your time.

513
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:19,237
I've got all the time
in the world for Nishu.

514
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,572
Where were you, Your Highness?

515
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:24,951
Clean up that mess,
and put the snacks in the fridge.

516
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:30,873
Excuse my cough.

517
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:35,086
So, what's the latest
on the queen of rage?

518
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,924
There's an ongoing investigation.
Let's see where it goes.

519
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:45,554
You see, these people
crave for the media's attention.

520
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:51,352
They think they will become
famous like that officer, Kiran Bedi.

521
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,397
The root of the matter is

522
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:57,191
these people engage in
domestic violence every day.

523
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:59,318
So, they are all naturally aggressive.

524
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:02,154
You've got a point.

525
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:05,241
Come, sit.

526
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:10,621
<i>You see, these special buses
will offer women a choice.</i>

527
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:16,502
<i>Our aim is to ensure that
they feel safe using the public transit.</i>

528
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:21,465
<i>Segregation is sometimes
necessary to ensure safety.</i>

529
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:25,177
<i>In case you've just joined us,
we have been in conversation</i>

530
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:28,973
<i>with our honorable guest,
Tourism Minister, Mr. Devi Dayal Doshi.</i>

531
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:32,685
<i>You're listening to</i> Voice of Delhi
<i>with me, Arun Roy.</i>

532
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:35,271
- Govind, make sure you have your dinner.
- Yessir.

533
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:02,381
Good evening, sir.

534
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:04,258
What's going on here?

535
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:11,015
A constable found this girl
crying in the City Mall's parking lot.

536
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,822
She won't tell us anything.
We've been questioning her for a while.

537
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:15,895
Step aside, please.

538
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:18,606
Please step out, both of you.

539
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:30,117
What's your name, sweetheart?

540
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:34,205
Don't be afraid. Tell me your name.

541
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:40,336
Where do you live?

542
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:46,300
Do you live in Delhi?

543
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,428
Then where?

544
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:55,184
Ranchi.

545
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:01,399
Do you know anyone here, in Delhi?

546
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,402
Who accompanied you to Delhi?

547
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:12,368
Don't be scared.
We'll soon take you to your parents.

548
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,538
Everything will be alright.

549
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:18,541
I'd like to have a word.

550
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:28,092
- Yes, madam?
- Can't you see the girl is scared?

551
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,763
On top of that,
three men were interrogating her.

552
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,889
- Madam...
- Did you call for a female officer?

553
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:36,142
I was about to make a phone call.

554
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:39,353
- I take it you understand the protocol?
- We just brought her in...

555
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,105
Spare me your explanations.

556
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:45,484
Call for a female officer immediately
to take her for a medical examination.

557
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,320
- Yes, madam.
- Hurry up.

558
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:50,072
What's the problem with these two?

559
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:52,867
- Madam, my husband committed no crime.
- You sit there.

560
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,577
That woman is lying.

561
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,996
- I swear by my daughter.
- Please be seated, madam!

562
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:59,039
- Please let him go. He is innocent.
- Wait!

563
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,458
Hold on a second!

564
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:03,501
What's this all about?

565
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:07,506
Madam, it's the lady versus landlord
case you asked us to investigate.

566
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,967
We've taken the landlord into custody.
She is his wife.

567
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:12,887
Madam, that day,
I was at home with my husband.

568
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,221
I told you to sit down!

569
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,015
- Ask our neighbors.
- Sit down.

570
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,098
That woman is lying.

571
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:20,394
- I have a house to run. Please!
- Please wait in the room.

572
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:24,023
Madam, please, believe me.
It's hard for us already.

573
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:25,816
Don't make a scene!

574
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:29,612
- Madam, I beg you. Please let him go.
- That's enough now.

575
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:31,405
You're at a police station! Behave!

576
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:36,785
Where's the complainant?

577
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:39,788
The lady refused to come
and submit a written complaint.

578
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,790
Has she given any statement at all?

579
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:44,210
No, I think, Soni madam was right.

580
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:46,980
This was indeed a land dispute,
which they have resolved between them.

581
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:48,644
So, this is none of her business anymore.

582
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:55,137
- Alright, let the man go.
- Yessir.

583
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:10,653
Can you...

584
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:15,658
get Soni reinstated?

585
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:20,329
You said you were
interviewing replacements.

586
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:24,500
None have been any good.
Things are looking grim.

587
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:27,878
Okay.

588
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:31,131
Let me send a few candidates your way.

589
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,972
But, you're going to dismiss them as well.

590
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:42,393
I can't believe you're
getting sentimental again.

591
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:47,189
Sandeep, I can't just go and hire anybody.

592
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:52,194
It's very hard to find
an officer like her.

593
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:58,200
- I know her heart is in the right place.
- It's her head that worries me.

594
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:00,327
I'll counsel her this time.

595
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:04,456
Kalpana, do not be friends
with your subordinates!

596
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:09,420
- It's not that easy to reinstate...
- At least try talking to the Commissioner.

597
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:14,258
You know that it wasn't all her fault.

598
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:25,769
The screen will flash on an incoming call.

599
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:29,440
Hit the space key to receive the call.

600
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:32,985
Most importantly, we must maintain a diary

601
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:35,237
with as many details as possible.

602
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:37,990
Especially the location.

603
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:42,494
Type in the notes
from the complaint in this diary.

604
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:46,832
The microphone is for
urgent announcements.

605
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:49,877
- You got it?
- Yes.

606
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,464
We have a call. Put on your headphones.

607
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,552
Delhi Police Control Room.
Good afternoon.

608
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:01,680
<i>Hello, we are experiencing
a foul smell in our neighborhood.</i>

609
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:03,349
Sir, your location, please.

610
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:05,809
<i>I'm calling from Sanjay Enclave.</i>

611
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:07,519
I'll need the exact address, please.

612
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,938
<i>It's building number 22, Sanjay Enclave.</i>

613
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:13,192
<i>It's a rotting carcass of some dog.
The stench is unbearable!</i>

614
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:17,088
Alright, sir. You'll receive a call
from your nearest police station.

615
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:19,591
But next time, it will be better
if you call the Municipal office.

616
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:20,866
<i>Municipal office?</i>

617
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:23,160
Yes, they'll take care of it.

618
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:26,747
<i>Nobody's going to take care of anything.
Can I talk to your supervisor?</i>

619
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:29,583
No, there's no supervisor here.

620
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,043
Tell me what your concerns are.

621
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:34,338
<i>Well, since you ask so nicely,
can I have your cellphone number?</i>

622
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:36,924
<i>Maybe we could talk offline.</i>

623
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:39,093
Okay, thanks for calling Delhi Police.

624
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:45,391
One or two such calls are a routine.

625
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:01,031
Soni madam!
Sweet buns?

626
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:02,324
- Two.
- How about three?

627
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:03,409
Okay.

628
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:05,953
Anything else?

629
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:07,913
- Two quarts of milk.
- Okay.

630
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,793
- Anything else?
- No, that's all.

631
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:14,116
- Add it to your account?
- Yes.

632
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:15,379
Add it in.

633
00:45:17,714 --> 00:45:19,091
Alright, see you.

634
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:30,394
Where are you off to?

635
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:33,856
My elder son needs my help
as he is moving to a new place.

636
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:37,151
I wish he would get married,
and let me off the hook.

637
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:38,318
Look at you!

638
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:40,737
Wear some warm clothes! You'll catch cold.

639
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:42,656
They're rather warm.

640
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,409
Will you be able
to carry that all by yourself?

641
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:48,287
- I'll ask someone to help you.
- I'll manage.

642
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:50,622
Listen, did you get the gas cylinder yet?

643
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:54,293
No, I called the gas agency.
It should've arrived by now.

644
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:56,211
I will call them again today.

645
00:45:57,212 --> 00:45:58,547
Who's going to cook for you?

646
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:00,507
You worry too much.

647
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:02,468
I can grab fast-food anytime I want.

648
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:04,344
Alright, whatever you say.

649
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:07,347
- You must be getting late.
- Yes, see you later.

650
00:47:01,693 --> 00:47:02,819
<i>Good evening.</i>

651
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:06,114
<i>From the National Radio Service,
this is the evening news.</i>

652
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:10,536
<i>Prime Minister Modi has said
that India’s scientific institutions</i>

653
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:15,791
<i>should strengthen their basic research,
just like other developed nations.</i>

654
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:21,129
<i>Mr. Modi made his statement
today at the Indian Science Congress.</i>

655
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,257
<i>The Army Chief General
has said in a statement</i>

656
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:28,845
<i>that the army must find innovative
ways to fight problems in Kashmir.</i>

657
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:34,935
<i>Heavy rains and winds expected
to lash several states in the east.</i>

658
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:42,025
<i>Warnings of heavy flooding
and cyclone issued in parts of Odisha.</i>

659
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:46,488
<i>And, Syrian peace talks
proposed by Russia and Turkey falter</i>

660
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:49,533
<i>as rebel groups refuse to negotiate.</i>

661
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:57,833
<i>This is the National Radio Service.
Now the news in detail.</i>

662
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,295
<i>Prime Minister Modi has said that by 2030</i>

663
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:06,425
<i>India will be among the top three
countries in Science and Technology.</i>

664
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:12,848
<i>Mr. Modi inaugurated the 104th
Indian Science Congress today.</i>

665
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:16,476
<i>He emphasized that we must
give our school children</i>

666
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:19,605
<i>the power of ideas and innovation.</i>

667
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:23,191
<i>And that tomorrow's experts will come</i>

668
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:26,278
<i>from the investments we
make in our people today.</i>

669
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:29,281
<i>Army Chief Gen. Bipin Rawat has said that</i>

670
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:33,493
<i>the Indian Army is facing
a dirty war in Jammu and Kashmir,</i>

671
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:36,622
<i>which has to be fought
through innovative ways.</i>

672
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:41,251
<i>In a statement today, he said
that in order to reach a solution,</i>

673
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:44,338
<i>all parties will have to get involved.</i>

674
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:47,716
<i>He said that the army’s role is to
ensure that violence does not take place</i>

675
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:50,510
<i>and that people not indulging
in this violence are protected.</i>

676
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:55,223
<i>The Syrian armed rebels have refused
all negotiations</i>

677
00:48:55,390 --> 00:49:00,228
<i>in the peace talks
backed by Russia and Turkey.</i>

678
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:53,240
Yes, I'm home.
But about to leave for work.

679
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:58,537
I've been reinstated.

680
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:02,290
I've had my dinner already.

681
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:09,548
Naveen, I can't
discuss these things right now.

682
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:15,387
Yes, maybe tomorrow, but I don't know.

683
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:27,149
Why is the team still not here?

684
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:29,693
Madam, I just had a phone call
with Chauhan.

685
00:50:29,776 --> 00:50:31,945
The team had to respond to an accident.

686
00:50:32,028 --> 00:50:34,072
There's an unclaimed
dead body at the scene.

687
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,617
They won't be able to make it, then.

688
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:40,078
Let's call it off for today.

689
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:41,621
- Madam!
- Yes?

690
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,415
There's a notorious spot nearby.

691
00:50:43,498 --> 00:50:45,709
We've recently had
some incidents reported there.

692
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:47,544
Let's go scout it.

693
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:58,230
My first case involving an unclaimed body
was that of an African male.

694
00:50:58,638 --> 00:50:59,806
No identification at all.

695
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,517
In fact, two of my officers
got into an argument

696
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:05,145
whether to bury the body or cremate it.

697
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,568
Madam...

698
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:15,030
such cases take
a toll on one's sensibilities.

699
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:17,532
But shouldn't male bodies be easily...

700
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:22,788
Is this a whore-house?
What are you doing here?

701
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:25,081
We're just college students, sir.

702
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:26,666
College students, my ass!

703
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:29,377
You piece of shit!

704
00:51:29,544 --> 00:51:31,546
You think I give a fuck?

705
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:36,301
Is this what they
teach in colleges these days?

706
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:38,678
Sir, please...

707
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:42,974
One would guess you belong
to a decent family, young lady.

708
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:45,101
Have you no shame?

709
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:49,314
- Let's inform your parents.
- Sir, please don't do that.

710
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:53,193
- We'll never come back here. I'm sorry!
- Enough of your "sorry" already!

711
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:55,862
Shove your "sorry" up your ass!

712
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:58,240
Keep your English to yourself, asshole.

713
00:51:58,323 --> 00:51:59,741
Don't you understand what I said?

714
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:01,827
Come on, give me your parents' number.

715
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:08,291
- Or just pay us a fine.
- Right, sir. Sure.

716
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:11,461
Here, you can have this.

717
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:13,839
- How much is it?
- 200.

718
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:16,967
I'll beat the shit
out of you, you son of a bitch.

719
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:18,802
You think we're panhandling here?

720
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:22,931
It'll take us a second to charge
you for obscenity in a public place.

721
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:24,933
How about I throw your sorry ass in jail?

722
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:29,688
Where you can enjoy watching
your family beg for your release.

723
00:52:31,064 --> 00:52:35,610
- I say we lock them up for a night, man.
- Sir, please don't!

724
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:37,279
Honey, do you have some on you?

725
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:41,449
Lover boy with an empty wallet,
asking his girl for money. Fucking loser!

726
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:42,868
Here, take more, sir.

727
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:45,704
- How much is this?
- We're giving you all we have, sir.

728
00:52:45,787 --> 00:52:48,331
Nothing less than 3000! Understand?

729
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:50,041
This is all we have. Please take it.

730
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:54,296
What is this? I'm not your pimp!

731
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:56,882
Why, what's wrong? Take it!

732
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:58,967
Too much pride to accept bribe
from a lady?

733
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:01,761
No, madam, these two
were engaged in obscene acts.

734
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:03,805
- I see.
- Go home, kids.

735
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:05,223
- But, madam...
- Out, you two!

736
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:07,434
- Madam...
- Out, I said!

737
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:18,403
Madam, I'll walk from here.

738
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,867
I'll take your leave, madam.

739
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:25,702
Okay.

740
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:32,292
- Is the tea any good here?
- It's very good!

741
00:53:33,793 --> 00:53:36,463
- Govind, get us two teas please.
- Yessir.

742
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:38,840
- Get one for yourself as well.
- Okay.

743
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:40,759
Madam...

744
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:43,219
I'll go tell the
vendor to make his special one.

745
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:45,263
He knows me well.

746
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:46,389
Okay.

747
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:57,233
- Hey! How are you doing?
- Good, madam.

748
00:53:58,485 --> 00:54:00,403
Give me the special one with fennel.

749
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:01,487
Absolutely.

750
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:19,673
Great!

751
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:25,679
- You getting yours?
- Yes.

752
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:32,102
- Pack me a two-egg omelet as well.
- Sure!

753
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:43,988
Not bad.

754
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:47,325
Don't you like cooking?

755
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:48,827
I do.

756
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:51,830
Oh, actually, my gas cylinder ran out.

757
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:54,249
I've called the gas agency
a couple of times.

758
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:58,169
- I don't know what's taking so long.
- Govind can get you one.

759
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:01,756
- No, madam. I'll manage.
- It's nothing. Don't worry.

760
00:55:01,881 --> 00:55:03,008
- Govind.
- Yes, madam?

761
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:06,177
- Please arrange a gas cylinder for her.
- Yessir!

762
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:09,556
- Madam, you didn't have to.
- It's okay.

763
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:19,607
I am still mad at
those constables at the park.

764
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:23,653
- You noted down their names, right?
- Yes.

765
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:27,907
Madam, the roasting you gave them!

766
00:55:28,324 --> 00:55:30,368
I'm sure they'll never forget it.

767
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:35,999
I was thinking...

768
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:41,379
even if they weren't seeking a bribe...

769
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:45,759
we have a whole backlog of cases,

770
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:49,596
yet, this is how they use
their policing time!

771
00:55:49,971 --> 00:55:51,347
I agree, madam.

772
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:57,645
By the way, what kind of advice
were you giving to that girl?

773
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:00,565
To dress up like a man?

774
00:56:01,274 --> 00:56:03,193
The thing is...

775
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:06,321
I used to do it myself
when I was in college.

776
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:09,074
Going on a date becomes so much easier.

777
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:10,533
Don't start again.

778
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:24,047
Reminds me of my late grandmother...

779
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:28,301
who was diagnosed with
a fungal ear infection.

780
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:36,142
The surgery required
the hair around the ear...

781
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:38,394
to be shaved.

782
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:42,690
She refused because
her hair was sacred to her.

783
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:46,736
The surgery never happened.

784
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:51,032
The infection spread...

785
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:54,369
and it became impossible to save her.

786
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:17,517
Soni.

787
00:58:25,376 --> 00:58:27,337
I wanted to tell you something.

788
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:30,256
I am opening up a pharmacy shop.

789
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:33,801
- Your shop folded already?
- The bloody supplier ran away.

790
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:38,306
This doctor I know has told me
that there's a 300% profit margin.

791
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:40,975
Once I get the license,
it will be a gold mine.

792
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:42,435
Isn't it always?

793
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:45,021
It's been the same story
for the past five years.

794
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:52,946
Make it quick!

795
00:58:55,114 --> 00:58:56,741
They're running late again.

796
00:59:00,745 --> 00:59:01,579
What happened?

797
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:04,916
They're winding up some paperwork.
Maybe another 20 minutes.

798
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:06,209
I see.

799
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:08,795
You eat too much junk food.

800
00:59:09,003 --> 00:59:12,549
- I barely had time to cook today.
- So, has your new gas cylinder arrived?

801
00:59:13,132 --> 00:59:15,009
I'll go get one tomorrow.

802
00:59:15,176 --> 00:59:16,636
- Govind!
- Yes, madam?

803
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:18,137
Where is her gas cylinder?

804
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:21,140
Madam... it should be on its way.
The order's been placed.

805
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:24,102
I gave you a simple task.
Spare me your lame excuses.

806
00:59:24,185 --> 00:59:25,270
I'll manage, madam.

807
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:27,605
- No later than tomorrow!
- Yessir.

808
00:59:28,189 --> 00:59:30,650
It's as if orders aren't orders,
until I raise my voice.

809
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:33,861
- Did you say 20 minutes?
- Yes.

810
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:36,739
- Wanna get some tea in the meantime?
- Sure.

811
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:43,454
Welcome.

812
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:02,908
Madam, you really shouldn't
worry about me.

813
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:04,350
This place looks pricey.

814
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:06,519
I'm not worrying at all.

815
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:09,772
What would you like to eat?

816
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:15,820
Just a cup of tea for me.

817
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:17,322
You go ahead.

818
01:00:18,406 --> 01:00:20,450
How about a <i>Dosa?</i>

819
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:21,868
Sure.

820
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:28,166
Two <i>Dosas</i> and two cups of tea.

821
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,571
For what?

822
01:01:01,282 --> 01:01:03,284
I know you fought for me.

823
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:07,413
I did what I could.

824
01:01:13,252 --> 01:01:15,463
Are things any better at home?

825
01:01:19,884 --> 01:01:21,594
I don't know.

826
01:01:22,428 --> 01:01:26,891
Some days... I feel things are improving.

827
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:29,852
On other days, they seem worse.

828
01:01:32,313 --> 01:01:34,649
They surely will never be the same.

829
01:01:42,281 --> 01:01:44,951
Once you truly know someone...

830
01:01:45,451 --> 01:01:47,870
is it easier to accept them?

831
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:58,840
- I'll quickly go use the washroom.
- Okay.

832
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:03,010
That way.

833
01:02:07,014 --> 01:02:09,016
- Where's the washroom?
- Pardon?

834
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:11,620
- Which way is the washroom?
- Straight ahead, behind that wall.

835
01:02:11,644 --> 01:02:12,854
Thanks.

836
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:50,266
Hey there!

837
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:55,062
- What's your name?
- Veronica.

838
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:56,981
Veronica!

839
01:02:57,899 --> 01:02:59,609
That's a beautiful name.

840
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:01,611
So, how old are you now?

841
01:03:06,407 --> 01:03:09,911
- What grade are you in?
- Public School.

842
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:16,250
Do you have any siblings, Veronica?

843
01:03:16,334 --> 01:03:18,544
Sis, I wanna go pee!

844
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:21,297
Sorry, she's been
holding it in for a while.

845
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:25,802
- Have you been waiting long?
- Yes, but it's locked from the inside.

846
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:28,971
Someone's probably in there.

847
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:42,401
Who is it?

848
01:03:47,448 --> 01:03:49,659
Just tell the motherfucker to fuck off.

849
01:03:55,623 --> 01:03:56,999
Bloody hell!

850
01:04:04,131 --> 01:04:05,716
Hello, madam!

851
01:04:06,467 --> 01:04:08,469
How can we help?

852
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:12,682
Get out of the ladies' room.

853
01:04:14,976 --> 01:04:16,769
- Gentlemen!
- Yeah?

854
01:04:17,144 --> 01:04:18,938
Check out that voice!

855
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:20,565
She's probably an opera singer.

856
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:22,692
Her voice is beautiful, no doubt.

857
01:04:22,775 --> 01:04:25,945
Madam, why don't you come join us?

858
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:30,408
That will give us a chance to see
other beautiful things about you.

859
01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:35,246
Don't mind these rude rascals.

860
01:04:36,038 --> 01:04:38,916
Probably best to keep the
kids away from them.

861
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:42,461
Just hold it in for another 30 minutes.

862
01:04:43,337 --> 01:04:45,548
We'll be done by then.

863
01:04:46,173 --> 01:04:47,550
Also...

864
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:52,889
tell the manager, that J.B. can't
share the bathroom with anyone.

865
01:04:53,848 --> 01:04:55,099
Bitch.

866
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:59,604
I got this.

867
01:05:00,646 --> 01:05:02,148
The lady is in the mood.

868
01:05:02,273 --> 01:05:03,441
She's feisty!

869
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:08,821
- All three of you out, right now!
- Or else?

870
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:15,536
I could swear,
I've seen her somewhere, man!

871
01:05:15,703 --> 01:05:18,372
You jerked off to her last night!

872
01:05:19,665 --> 01:05:21,459
Your favorite website!

873
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:24,503
I'd love to see you perform live.

874
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:27,340
- Filthy pig!
- Fucking bitch!

875
01:06:05,336 --> 01:06:06,462
Yes, sir.

876
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:09,548
I just had a word with your assistant.

877
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:11,842
Yessir.

878
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:14,470
I'm surely going to look into it, sir.

879
01:06:15,346 --> 01:06:17,974
Yessir.

880
01:06:21,727 --> 01:06:23,604
Did someone just drop by?

881
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:33,739
Sandeep?

882
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:45,292
What's going on?

883
01:06:45,918 --> 01:06:47,920
You need to tell me...

884
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:49,755
what's going on.

885
01:06:52,925 --> 01:06:55,428
Wasn't last night's operation
at the metro station?

886
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:08,858
Yes.

887
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:11,110
However, your team got busy

888
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:13,362
turning a restaurant upside down
with Badwal's son.

889
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:17,408
Badwal, who?

890
01:07:27,752 --> 01:07:30,629
An old friend of Tourism Minister Doshi...

891
01:07:31,505 --> 01:07:34,550
as well as his party's election fund.

892
01:07:38,095 --> 01:07:42,224
I've repeatedly warned you. Haven't I?

893
01:07:44,185 --> 01:07:45,936
Now you see the outcome.

894
01:07:46,979 --> 01:07:51,484
Doshi sent his assistant
to humiliate me in my own house.

895
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:05,164
His son was in possession of cocaine.

896
01:08:05,873 --> 01:08:07,792
Good luck proving this possession!

897
01:08:08,042 --> 01:08:10,544
We can still nab him
for consumption of drugs.

898
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:13,089
And then what?
A fine of twenty thousand?

899
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:17,009
Before any of that happens, you'll be
dragged into yet another inquiry.

900
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:20,596
For someone who's been
doing this for four years...

901
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:22,306
you're incredibly naive!

902
01:08:31,065 --> 01:08:32,817
Are you satisfied now?

903
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:35,528
Or still hungry for more?

904
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:42,493
- Now you're being really rude.
- What do you expect?

905
01:08:44,995 --> 01:08:47,373
Are you going to pin all the blame on me?

906
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:48,499
No.

907
01:08:49,875 --> 01:08:51,293
I'm the one at fault...

908
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:54,130
for listening to you.

909
01:08:57,883 --> 01:09:03,681
I'm tired of repeating myself,
that you've got to be authoritative!

910
01:09:08,352 --> 01:09:10,563
Why be a cop if
you're never going to act like one?

911
01:09:25,703 --> 01:09:30,249
<i>Each bus will have the
presence of a woman security guard</i>

912
01:09:30,457 --> 01:09:32,293
<i>as well as a female fare collector.</i>

913
01:09:32,376 --> 01:09:34,962
<i>The buses will have a CCTV camera</i>

914
01:09:35,045 --> 01:09:37,506
<i>and a host of other safety measures.</i>

915
01:09:57,902 --> 01:10:00,029
Good evening, madam!
Please come in.

916
01:10:08,537 --> 01:10:09,538
Here.

917
01:10:10,247 --> 01:10:11,957
You didn't have to do this, madam.

918
01:10:12,124 --> 01:10:14,293
It's okay. It's just food.

919
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:16,003
How's your wrist?

920
01:10:16,128 --> 01:10:18,214
Getting better.
I'll get you some water.

921
01:10:18,297 --> 01:10:21,300
No, I'm fine. You should eat.

922
01:10:22,343 --> 01:10:23,886
I'll get some plates then.

923
01:10:42,947 --> 01:10:45,241
Did that man hit you first?

924
01:10:53,332 --> 01:10:55,084
Soni, I'm asking you a question.

925
01:11:04,134 --> 01:11:06,136
Are you listening to me?

926
01:11:07,888 --> 01:11:09,932
The man occupies the ladies room,

927
01:11:10,015 --> 01:11:12,810
calls me a whore,
snorts drugs publicly,

928
01:11:12,893 --> 01:11:14,603
and I'm the one who has to explain myself?

929
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:17,022
I was also there.

930
01:11:18,607 --> 01:11:20,818
Why didn't you come back and inform me?

931
01:11:22,361 --> 01:11:24,363
We could have easily nabbed him.

932
01:11:25,572 --> 01:11:26,991
He got nabbed anyway.

933
01:11:30,995 --> 01:11:32,538
We're not pressing charges.

934
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:38,252
Don't argue with me
when you don't know the facts!

935
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:41,755
You can't let him off.

936
01:11:44,008 --> 01:11:46,093
Do you realize what the
consequences might be?

937
01:11:47,177 --> 01:11:48,762
What's the worse than can happen?

938
01:11:49,596 --> 01:11:51,515
Perhaps another inquiry?

939
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:53,475
No more decoy operations?

940
01:11:56,854 --> 01:11:59,189
Haven't we seen their cowardly policies?

941
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:02,818
Special taxis, segregated buses...

942
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:04,361
Fenced ghettos will come...

943
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:07,990
Throw another one!

944
01:12:08,198 --> 01:12:09,491
Too late now. Go!

945
01:12:11,577 --> 01:12:12,911
Bastards!

946
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:15,914
You bastards!

947
01:12:16,957 --> 01:12:18,208
Go, go!

948
01:12:18,792 --> 01:12:20,252
Hey, stop!

949
01:12:21,545 --> 01:12:22,629
Son of a bitch!

950
01:12:22,713 --> 01:12:24,465
You cowards!

951
01:12:42,816 --> 01:12:44,860
Motherfuckers!

952
01:12:45,569 --> 01:12:47,529
I'll hunt down these motherfuckers!

953
01:12:47,613 --> 01:12:50,366
- Don't bother. I can manage.
- Manage?

954
01:12:50,449 --> 01:12:52,201
That's what you've been saying all along.

955
01:12:52,284 --> 01:12:53,911
Is this what you call managing?

956
01:12:53,994 --> 01:12:56,038
We wouldn't have this mess,
had I been living here!

957
01:12:56,163 --> 01:12:58,999
Those sons of bitches
would have been dead right now!

958
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:02,211
- You don't have to raise your voice.
- Soni, listen to me!

959
01:13:02,294 --> 01:13:04,296
Listen to what? Tell me!

960
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:07,383
Do you ever listen to yourself?

961
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:10,260
Always building castles in the air.

962
01:13:10,344 --> 01:13:12,304
At least I live on my own terms.

963
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:15,015
I don't bob my head
and say "yessir" all the time.

964
01:13:15,099 --> 01:13:17,142
Of course, why would you?

965
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:19,395
When have you ever
taken any responsibility?

966
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:23,732
You never wanted anything
that would tie you down, right?

967
01:14:32,009 --> 01:14:33,510
Soni...

968
01:14:33,844 --> 01:14:38,765
I know that you still haven't forgiven me.

969
01:14:42,561 --> 01:14:46,773
You have every right to punish me.

970
01:14:47,608 --> 01:14:49,485
I will accept any punishment.

971
01:14:51,653 --> 01:14:55,616
I would've done it long ago,
had I thought it would do any good.

972
01:15:03,415 --> 01:15:06,251
At least give me a chance to make amends.

973
01:15:09,713 --> 01:15:12,716
I know I hurt you. I admit it.

974
01:15:15,677 --> 01:15:18,305
But, at the time,
I didn't know what else to do.

975
01:15:20,557 --> 01:15:22,601
I felt ignored to the extent

976
01:15:22,684 --> 01:15:24,728
that I thought
you didn't need me in this house.

977
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:28,148
And what's different now?

978
01:15:37,407 --> 01:15:38,617
Look...

979
01:15:39,034 --> 01:15:41,286
I need you, Soni.

980
01:15:43,038 --> 01:15:44,873
And as we stand here in this mess...

981
01:15:45,499 --> 01:15:49,545
I honestly feel that you need me as well.

982
01:16:00,055 --> 01:16:02,099
You really have the nerve
to suggest that, Naveen?

983
01:16:06,228 --> 01:16:11,400
It was because of you
that I suffered... so much.

984
01:16:16,989 --> 01:16:19,408
I trusted you blindly.

985
01:16:23,662 --> 01:16:25,914
Followed you wherever you wanted to go,

986
01:16:26,039 --> 01:16:28,125
with my eyes closed.

987
01:16:31,128 --> 01:16:33,088
And when I opened them...

988
01:16:33,797 --> 01:16:35,799
you weren't there.

989
01:16:37,634 --> 01:16:39,845
There wasn't even a shadow of you.

990
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:50,689
Soni, after the termination,
my life was shattered as much as yours.

991
01:16:54,192 --> 01:16:56,320
And did you help me pick up the pieces?

992
01:16:59,114 --> 01:17:01,074
The decision was yours.

993
01:17:02,492 --> 01:17:03,744
Yes, it was.

994
01:17:04,745 --> 01:17:06,580
The decision was mine.

995
01:17:09,666 --> 01:17:11,960
But you always wished
I'd do it, didn't you?

996
01:17:14,546 --> 01:17:17,633
You weren't even around to stop me.

997
01:17:32,397 --> 01:17:34,775
We could try again.

998
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:37,486
Is this all a joke to you?

999
01:17:56,838 --> 01:17:59,800
I was doing it with my girl in my car

1000
01:17:59,883 --> 01:18:02,302
and this fucking cop banged on my window!

1001
01:18:02,386 --> 01:18:06,056
He said, "Your car's shaking
like a washing machine!"

1002
01:18:06,431 --> 01:18:09,101
- Hey, you!
- Cut it out, man!

1003
01:18:09,976 --> 01:18:12,604
Dude, next time, get a fucking hotel room.

1004
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:15,899
Only morons like you would go to a hotel.

1005
01:18:16,024 --> 01:18:19,945
Hotels are nothing but traps!

1006
01:18:20,028 --> 01:18:22,698
They'll call the cops on you

1007
01:18:22,781 --> 01:18:26,576
and those bastards won't let you off
without a fat bribe. And...

1008
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:30,038
Dude, hotels have escorts
going in and out all the time.

1009
01:18:30,122 --> 01:18:32,290
It's only dimwits like you who get caught.

1010
01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:33,583
It's not funny, man.

1011
01:18:33,959 --> 01:18:36,545
The brothels are
running right under their noses.

1012
01:18:36,628 --> 01:18:38,380
Well, you can't do shit about it.

1013
01:18:56,857 --> 01:18:58,900
Light me a cigarette, man.

1014
01:21:09,239 --> 01:21:11,616
We'll be there in an hour.

1015
01:21:12,284 --> 01:21:13,743
See you, then.

1016
01:21:55,827 --> 01:21:58,455
Offerings for the fire.

1017
01:22:05,337 --> 01:22:07,339
Good evening! Warm greetings!

1018
01:22:07,422 --> 01:22:10,508
- Happy <i>Lohri</i> to all!
- Warm greetings to you too, dear!

1019
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:13,362
- Haven't seen you in a while!
- Yes, we've been blessed with a grandson!

1020
01:22:13,386 --> 01:22:16,681
- Wow! Congratulations!
- Thank you.

1021
01:22:16,806 --> 01:22:20,060
- Celebrating the little one's first <i>Lohri?</i>
- Yes, absolutely!

1022
01:22:35,283 --> 01:22:37,077
Happy <i>Lohri!</i>

1023
01:22:41,539 --> 01:22:43,541
Why are all the lights off?
Sleeping?

1024
01:22:55,762 --> 01:22:58,348
What's with all this mess?

1025
01:23:10,568 --> 01:23:14,072
Your mom said you locked yourself in
after you came back from school.

1026
01:23:45,478 --> 01:23:47,522
Stressed about grades?

1027
01:24:07,167 --> 01:24:08,501
What's going on?

1028
01:24:09,461 --> 01:24:11,337
Come on, you can tell me.

1029
01:24:17,052 --> 01:24:18,261
Nishu.

1030
01:24:22,307 --> 01:24:24,309
Because of my period...

1031
01:24:24,517 --> 01:24:28,188
I was making frequent
trips to the washroom, at school.

1032
01:24:29,397 --> 01:24:30,648
When...

1033
01:24:30,815 --> 01:24:33,693
When I returned to
the classroom after my lunch break,

1034
01:24:33,777 --> 01:24:37,697
there was a sanitary pad taped to my desk,

1035
01:24:38,114 --> 01:24:40,450
along with a note
that said "For those days."

1036
01:24:42,827 --> 01:24:44,412
Do you know who did it?

1037
01:24:45,371 --> 01:24:46,873
No.

1038
01:24:48,833 --> 01:24:50,543
Did you report this to your teacher?

1039
01:24:51,586 --> 01:24:55,298
Report whom?
Everyone was laughing at me.

1040
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:57,717
Including my own friends.

1041
01:25:06,810 --> 01:25:09,354
Felt like shooting them all.

1042
01:25:36,047 --> 01:25:37,882
Look at me, sweetie.

1043
01:25:39,884 --> 01:25:43,263
Report this to your teacher.
Find out who did it.

1044
01:25:44,931 --> 01:25:47,016
And you must confront them.

1045
01:25:51,855 --> 01:25:53,815
But, remember one thing...

1046
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:58,361
they will always
try to get the better of you.

1047
01:25:58,444 --> 01:26:00,196
Because they know...

1048
01:26:00,822 --> 01:26:02,949
that you're stronger than them.

1049
01:26:06,494 --> 01:26:08,121
They fear you.

1050
01:27:57,939 --> 01:27:59,524
Some water, madam?

1051
01:28:01,567 --> 01:28:03,945
- I'll make some tea.
- Please don't trouble yourself!

1052
01:28:04,070 --> 01:28:08,074
- It'll only take a minute!
- Please! I'd rather sit and talk.

1053
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:24,590
I brought this for you.

1054
01:28:26,050 --> 01:28:28,261
<i>The Revenue Stamp.</i>

1055
01:28:28,511 --> 01:28:31,180
I've read a few
short stories by Amrita Pritam.

1056
01:28:31,889 --> 01:28:34,142
Good. This is her memoir.

1057
01:28:37,395 --> 01:28:39,022
You're giving me your own copy?

1058
01:28:40,732 --> 01:28:43,484
Yes, I want you to have it.

1059
01:28:44,235 --> 01:28:45,945
I'm sure you'll like it.

1060
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:53,661
If not all...
it should answer a few of your questions.

1061
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:03,212
What is a revenue stamp?

1062
01:29:04,297 --> 01:29:09,719
It's a small excise stamp for
tax collection on tobacco and liquor.

1063
01:29:14,057 --> 01:29:20,605
An esteemed writer
once told Amrita Pritam...

1064
01:29:22,357 --> 01:29:24,776
that her life was so inconsequential...

1065
01:29:27,028 --> 01:29:30,406
that all of it could fit
on the back of a revenue stamp.

1066
01:29:46,839 --> 01:29:48,716
I can't have you resign, Soni.

1067
01:29:56,474 --> 01:29:58,893
If only I was making
the slightest difference.

1068
01:30:16,744 --> 01:30:19,288
I have a 13-year-old niece...

1069
01:30:21,749 --> 01:30:23,709
who's very fond of me.

1070
01:30:27,672 --> 01:30:30,216
She said an appalling thing today.

1071
01:30:32,468 --> 01:30:35,972
She said that she wanted to shoot
all her classmates.

1072
01:30:40,143 --> 01:30:43,229
Some of them played a gross prank on her.

1073
01:30:49,026 --> 01:30:51,612
In a situation such as this...

1074
01:30:51,988 --> 01:30:57,118
did my words make any difference?
Who knows?

1075
01:31:00,913 --> 01:31:02,582
All I know is...

1076
01:31:03,499 --> 01:31:08,171
I comforted her.

1077
01:31:16,554 --> 01:31:19,932
- Did you get his statement?
- He's being difficult.

1078
01:31:24,187 --> 01:31:26,564
- Bring him in.
- Yessir.

1079
01:31:39,660 --> 01:31:42,163
- Let go of me, asshole!
- Keep walking!

1080
01:31:42,246 --> 01:31:43,724
- Keep your hands off me!
- Just get in!

1081
01:31:43,748 --> 01:31:45,748
- I want my phone!
- I'm not your butler, shithead.

1082
01:31:45,791 --> 01:31:46,810
I won't give any statement!

1083
01:31:46,834 --> 01:31:48,252
- I want my phone back!
- Shut up!

1084
01:31:48,336 --> 01:31:51,923
You can't intimidate me.
I'm not giving any statement!

1085
01:31:52,006 --> 01:31:53,006
Stop your babble!

1086
01:31:53,049 --> 01:31:55,468
Madam, I want a word
with the Commissioner.

1087
01:31:56,761 --> 01:31:58,346
I want the Commissioner!

1088
01:31:58,512 --> 01:32:01,265
- Have the charges been drafted yet?
- Yessir. "Attempt to Kidnap."

1089
01:32:01,390 --> 01:32:03,202
- Add "Criminal Trespassing" as well.
- Yessir.

1090
01:32:03,226 --> 01:32:05,186
Is this a joke?

1091
01:32:05,269 --> 01:32:06,604
Listen to me very carefully!

1092
01:32:06,687 --> 01:32:09,357
You know who my father is. Very well!

1093
01:32:09,607 --> 01:32:11,234
You can't confiscate my phone like this!

1094
01:32:11,317 --> 01:32:12,902
I need to call my father right now.

1095
01:32:12,985 --> 01:32:15,571
We've sealed your phone.
It's part of the evidence now.

1096
01:32:15,988 --> 01:32:17,406
I don't care!

1097
01:32:17,490 --> 01:32:19,492
- Get my father on the line...
- Quiet!

1098
01:32:19,575 --> 01:32:22,286
Send his father
a copy of the formal report.

1099
01:32:22,411 --> 01:32:25,081
- Yessir.
- Formal report?

1100
01:32:25,164 --> 01:32:26,832
Tell him he needs to come in.

1101
01:32:27,375 --> 01:32:28,960
You owe me an explanation!

1102
01:32:29,043 --> 01:32:31,688
I've been made to sit outside for hours,
without even a glass of water.

1103
01:32:31,712 --> 01:32:33,506
I know my rights!

1104
01:32:34,507 --> 01:32:37,593
You should have thought about them
when you occupied the ladies room.

1105
01:32:37,677 --> 01:32:40,388
I'm going to file a complaint. You'll see.

1106
01:32:40,638 --> 01:32:42,199
Also add "Illicit Trafficking of Drugs,"

1107
01:32:42,223 --> 01:32:44,934
- and "Assaulting an Officer on Duty."
- Yessir.

1108
01:32:45,977 --> 01:32:47,103
Hang on a minute.

1109
01:32:47,186 --> 01:32:48,771
Show me the evidence!

1110
01:32:48,854 --> 01:32:50,898
You'll see the evidence in court.

1111
01:32:52,358 --> 01:32:56,153
- How long a detention did we file for?
- Seven days.

1112
01:32:56,237 --> 01:32:58,739
- Make it 14, and...
- Madam, listen to me.

1113
01:32:58,823 --> 01:33:00,032
Do not interrupt me!

1114
01:33:00,157 --> 01:33:02,034
Make sure his call-record is attached.

1115
01:33:02,535 --> 01:33:04,578
- Madam, just hear me out...
- Let's go, boy!

1116
01:33:04,662 --> 01:33:06,247
Hang on, I'm talking to her.

1117
01:33:06,330 --> 01:33:07,415
Keep your hands off me!

1118
01:34:52,019 --> 01:34:54,021
Delhi Police Control Room.
Good evening.
