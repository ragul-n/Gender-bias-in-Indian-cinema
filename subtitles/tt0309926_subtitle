1
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,600
They say Noorie drowned in the river

2
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,240
Some say she committed suicide

3
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,240
What do you think, Holy One?

4
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,200
Allah knows the one who has
transgressed the laws of nature

5
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,000
Who?

6
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,880
Allah knows

7
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,760
What is to happen now?

8
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:13,960
Nature takes her revenge. People
may forget. It may all be forgotten

9
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:21,200
But Nature works on...
quietly, in some form or the other

10
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,560
And when time has run its course,

11
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,799
Nature in all her fury,
takes her prey

12
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:35,920
Noorie was so beautiful.
- Innocent, unbeguiled, quiet

13
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:41,200
People loved to watch her.
- To touch her, to talk to her

14
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,560
She was a gift of nature,
a gift of the river

15
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,000
that flows past her village

16
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,040
As bright as the snow, as pure

17
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:58,799
Noorie was the soul of our valleys,
she gave fragrance to the pines

18
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,680
The sinners that they are,
they only lusted

19
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,920
They do not see the
fires that simmer within

20
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,240
This too is nature at play

21
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,919
Come inside, Yusuf.
- Come, sit by the fires for a while

22
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's very chilly out here.
You might catch a cold

23
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:23,880
The chill, one would have to feel.
My feelings are stilled forever

24
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,000
And my soul... what of the chill?

25
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,480
What are you doing here?

26
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,359
You were talking about Noorie. I
thought I'd listen to you speak

27
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,520
How did you know
we're discussing Noorie?

28
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,480
The winds you've never
spoken to, nor heard

29
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:52,760
The winds that blow in Spring...
this wind is so pure. It hides nothing

30
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,760
Now he's going to stand in front of
Noorie's house; he'll wait and wait

31
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,720
"Come to me"

32
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,719
"My love"

33
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:44,920
"Come into my heart"

34
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,320
"Let me slake my thirsting heart"

35
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,800
"This bright, mellow morning"

36
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,760
"The light touches my soul"

37
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,640
"It asks me softly"

38
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,880
"Do you know?"

39
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,440
"Who is in your heart?"

40
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,360
"Come to me"

41
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:26,240
"Come into my heart, and tell me"

42
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,960
"The pain is so sweet"

43
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,800
"Desire is aroused"

44
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,760
"I thirst for love I'm possessed"

45
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,520
"I can think no more"

46
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,480
"Come to me"

47
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:02,400
"Come into my heart
Arouse my passions"

48
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,959
"The beautiful evening"

49
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,680
"Carries your fragrance"

50
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,439
"When I see flowers blossoming"

51
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:22,079
"I think of you"

52
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,079
"Come to me"

53
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:33,000
"Come into my heart
Fill me with fire"

54
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,680
I told you to come and meet
my father, like a gentleman

55
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,040
I'm talking about seeing you.

56
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,520
And you want me to see your father!

57
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,680
To see me, you must see my
father first. Understand?

58
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,960
But the two of them
are like bodyguards

59
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,719
your father and your pet Khairoo

60
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,880
If I make good money today,
I'll buy lots of meat for you

61
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,680
You should've been a rich man's pet

62
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,319
Not a poor man's pet

63
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,800
Hey Lala! So you aren't dead yet!

64
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,280
Why, what's your interest?

65
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,400
My turn will come only after each...

66
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,360
and everyone else
in this village is dead

67
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,400
Till then, I'll guard my
wealth like a serpent!

68
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:58,000
Your eyes would pop out if a
walnut dropped on your head

69
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:03,080
Why did God give me a
usurer for a childhood friend?

70
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,320
And yet, I'm the one
who stands to lose

71
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:12,280
God willing, if you die, I'll
still have to pay for your funeral

72
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,319
Is that wood for sale?
- No

73
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,439
It's meant for your funeral pyre.
- How much for?

74
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,319
Three Rupees. - 3 Rupees
for that wood? I'll pay one

75
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,160
Lala, will you take along
your money after you die?

76
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,160
Stop blabbering. 2 Rupees.
Just because you're a friend

77
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,840
Take it, or I leave.
- All right, I'll take it

78
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,560
Madcap, I brought it for you.
- Then I won't pay you 2 Rupees

79
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,280
Put it down here

80
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,359
Two Rupees. Keep it.
You've earned it

81
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:58,600
If at all Lala, in the good
deeds of your daughter-in-law...

82
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,000
your sins may be washed.
- About your dog!

83
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:05,840
Have you been teaching him too,
how to snatch what he can from me

84
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,240
Don't you blame a mutt

85
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,959
May Allah forgive you
- And may Allah strike you down

86
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,640
Come on, Khairoo.
- Wait Uncle

87
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,000
I'll give you some sugar.
- You're asking for curses

88
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:30,440
Keep it. Noorie will need it for
tea. - My enemy! Right in my backyard!

89
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,720
I've been teaching her nothing!
- That's expected from you

90
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,040
It's for free! Enjoy it!

91
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,680
The sugar is gone. Even the bowl!
Go on, give everything away!

92
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,840
Finish eating and get to work!
- Yes, I'm going

93
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,840
So you're here

94
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,760
You're very lucky...

95
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,240
to have entered
Bashir Khan's dreams!

96
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,080
The girl Bashir sets his eyes on...

97
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,600
becomes the gem of his boudoir!

98
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,160
What are you looking
for there? Come here

99
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,120
Where are you?
- Right in front of your eyes

100
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,480
Strange! You vanish
right in front of my eyes!

101
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,440
That's why I tell you,
love isn't for cowards

102
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:02,840
If you come home, my
father won't hang you for it

103
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,800
I guess I will have to screw up
my courage and face your father

104
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,720
But when?

105
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,840
Now that I can't put
it off any longer...

106
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,360
I'll do it right tomorrow.
I'll dress for the occasion

107
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,280
Passed the first test

108
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,160
Now the second. Allah help me!

109
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,640
Salaam aleikum, Uncle

110
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,520
Waleikum salaam

111
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,120
Uncle I...

112
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,160
I'm Fakir Mohammad's son

113
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,199
Which Fakir Mohammad?

114
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,560
Carpenter

115
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,520
We used to live by the river

116
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,560
You had him make your
bed ...Fakir Mohammad

117
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:10,439
But he's dead, isn't he?
- But I'm alive

118
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,680
That I can see

119
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,239
Sit

120
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,319
I work in Bashir Khan's factory

121
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,280
That scoundrel?

122
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,680
I only work for him

123
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,920
What brings you here?

124
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,960
What's wrong with you?
Why don't you speak?

125
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,480
I'll come back later

126
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,560
Strange fellow

127
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,200
Do you know who that fellow is?

128
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:54,320
He told you his name. Yusuf.
- Oh yes. Why was he here?

129
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,600
To meet you, perhaps.
- But why?

130
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,960
How would I know?

131
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,200
Where does he live?
- By the river

132
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,840
He told you so. He's
Fakir Mohammad's son

133
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:13,240
Where does he work?
- Abba! Didn't you hear?

134
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,760
He works in Bashir Khan's factory.
- But...

135
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,240
Why did he come here?

136
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,600
Do you know him?

137
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,399
Well he is...

138
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,680
What did he say his name was?
- Yusuf, son of Fakir Mohammad

139
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,120
He lives by the river,
and he works for a living

140
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,520
Nice fellow. I approve

141
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,200
I'm an old foggy!

142
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,600
What happened? Why are you moping?
- Should I be dancing?

143
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,880
Thanks for calling me over
and making me look like a fool

144
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,879
What is the matter?
- What indeed!

145
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:08,360
First that dear brother of
yours Khairoo... he frisks me

146
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,880
As if I was packing a gun!
After he's done with me...

147
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:16,080
it's your Abba (Father),
quizzing me like a schoolmaster!

148
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,000
You were aghast

149
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:23,159
He asked you why you had come.
And not a word from you!

150
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,480
Would you rather that I sang?
- Why not? I love songs

151
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,440
I don't know about Khairoo.
- Are you here to finish the joke?

152
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,200
I saw you moping. I thought I'd ask

153
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,360
I'm fine, and I wish you well!

154
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,200
Nice to know

155
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,280
What more?

156
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,920
The wound is still raw.
Don't rub it in!

157
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,679
And maybe, you could
tell me about yourself

158
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,920
I will be happy

159
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,600
I have received your letter.

160
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,120
And I know what you're going through

161
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,960
I pray to Allah that you be happy,
and may you find peace

162
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,240
Thank you for your offer
of peace and happiness

163
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,760
In reply, let me tell you
that sentiment is no good

164
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,399
I do not seek your sympathies.
I need your love

165
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,080
In this matter, I have to
tell you that Abba said,

166
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,480
"Nice boy. I approve"

167
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,639
What?

168
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,400
"I'm not far away"

169
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,480
"I'm with you"

170
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:46,280
"Forever, I'm yours"

171
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,120
"I have only to look at you"

172
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,880
"You bring me good luck"

173
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,000
Khan, you've lost Noorie

174
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:02,639
In a few days, she's
going to marry Yusuf

175
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,720
This is giving you a bad name.
She's so pretty!

176
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,320
One look at her, and a man
will even forget his parents!

177
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:15,640
Why don't you abduct her?
- Once you're done with her...

178
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,000
she's going to be
yours all your life.

179
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,720
Even a year or two in prison...

180
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,800
isn't too much a price to pay.
- I'd be willing to serve 7 years!

181
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:31,120
But for Faulad Khan's sake,
we won't even look at her

182
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:37,840
That bastard hasn't married
her yet. - Not yet. But will

183
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:45,440
He won't. If not Faulad Khan,
let the dogs have her

184
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,240
Who is she?
- Gulam Nabi's daughter

185
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:23,360
Gulam Nabi, tell me how are you?
- It's all the grace of Allah

186
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,639
How long will you pull on
with only Allah's grace?

187
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,159
How about giving
Bashir Khan a chance?

188
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:37,160
It is by His grace that I live.
I am as He will have me

189
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,720
I too am Allah's servant.

190
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:47,040
Will your God be angered
if I were to help you?

191
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,480
I am not helpless
enough to seek a man's mercy

192
00:23:53,680 --> 00:24:00,320
Gulam Nabi, why get irked?
I'm talking about your own good

193
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,800
Your daughter is young. I
hear she is very beautiful

194
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,680
Do not forget me. I may be of help

195
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,000
That pauper talked back at me!

196
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:25,159
And why not? That bastard
has such a pretty daughter!

197
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:29,160
I'm no Bashir Khan
unless I abduct her!

198
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,520
Make no mistake!

199
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,456
Eat something as piping hot,
and you'll scald your tongue

200
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,880
He's Lala's friend too.
This might prove costly

201
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,480
Caught you! I've been
expecting you for sometime!

202
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:51,560
Big fish always eat small fish
- Big fish! You call me big fish?

203
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:56,360
I could chew you alive!
- All right. You have an upper hand

204
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,720
And when will you have the
upper hand? After you're dead?

205
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,360
For the poor, it's
always after one has died

206
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,439
But every act will be accounted for.

207
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,120
Talk sense.

208
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,160
You're hard-pressed
to even find food.

209
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,720
What do you expect in that
other world? Sweets to eat?

210
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,120
To each his own conscience, Lala.
- Don't drag conscience into deals!

211
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,120
You need money?

212
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,840
How much?

213
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,720
One thousand

214
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,720
Have you ever seen a
thousand together?

215
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,120
To tell you the truth, never

216
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,800
Your land is already
mortgaged with me.

217
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:47,200
Do you have any gold?
- No.

218
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:50,399
Any house?
- Yes, I have my house

219
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,440
That house is just a pile of dirt!

220
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,280
It'd fetch a hundred at most!

221
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,240
How will you pay the rest 900?
- Lend it to me on interest

222
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:03,880
I'll sign on anything. - And
what do I do with paper? Eat it?

223
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,200
Tell me, why do you need the money?

224
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,240
Are you marrying again?
- Goodness!

225
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,000
I'd never commit a sin at this age!

226
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:22,120
Noorie is grown up.
And Noorie is all I have

227
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,840
Lala, I'm getting her married

228
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:33,399
You know this
village is full of devils

229
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,800
I want to get over
with this as soon as I can

230
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:44,000
And you want a thousand for it?
What use is 1,000? Take 2,000

231
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,080
You have to pay for clothes,
jewellery and the lunch.

232
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,640
How will you make
do with a thousand?

233
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,840
But I still have to pay you back

234
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,399
I'll have to work all
my life, to pay it back

235
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:01,600
How much longer do you have to
live? For you, it's today or tomorrow

236
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,959
We'll settle our
accounts in the next world

237
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,480
Now get lost and prepare for
Noorie's wedding. Get going

238
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:12,320
Noorie is as much my
child as she is yours

239
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,800
Let's marry her off in style

240
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,320
If not yours, you have
to take care of my dignity

241
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,040
Do you know how pretty you are?

242
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,160
Can you tell me?

243
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,400
Do you know how nice you are?

244
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,760
Can you tell me?

245
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,840
You've made life difficult
for every man in the village

246
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,960
Do you like me?
- Very much

247
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,760
For me, that's enough

248
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,240
How long do you need
to craft the jewellery?

249
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:04,679
A fortnight or so.
- Don't you have something ready?

250
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,920
How can I go home empty-handed?
- All these belong to others

251
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,840
Yes, I have these anklets.
- Let me see

252
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,679
Pretty. I'll take them.
- All right

253
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,656
If it's not an exact fit,
I'll have it altered later

254
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,160
Consider my shop yours

255
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:46,120
Khairoo, you're coming with me,
to Bhabhi's aren't you?

256
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,640
Bhabhi is so nice.

257
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,720
If you don't come with me,
I won't talk to you

258
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,480
Come on, I'm scared.

259
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:01,679
The ironsmith's son
Faulad Khan teases me

260
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,360
Today, Allah would give me anything!

261
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,120
Save me... save me...

262
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,240
Did you ask for me?
- Welcome, Gulam Nabi. Sit

263
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,679
Be seated

264
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,120
The other day you
got irked for no reason

265
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:01,040
I did not mean anything ill.
After all, I live in this village too

266
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,240
This is where I
will live all my life

267
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:08,600
I have lots of property, and money.
I'm thinking about getting married

268
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,320
What has that to do with me?
- You don't understand?

269
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,960
I want to marry Noorie

270
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,160
I maybe poor. But I
am a honorable man

271
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,320
The whole world
knows what you're about

272
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:30,840
If you ever mention
Noorie again, I'll kill you!

273
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,760
Who is it?

274
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,920
Come in. The door is open

275
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,919
What have you been up to?
Hiding your riches?

276
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:55,240
Not riches. But I do have a
diamond I'm trying to hide

277
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:00,840
What do you take me for? Some
thief? - Thief? You're a bandit!

278
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,000
No knowing when you might elope!

279
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,200
Actually, I've been
trying to steal something

280
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,360
But I need your help.
- Meaning?

281
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,320
I'm getting married.

282
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,360
And I have no relative

283
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,840
I brought along a ring.
Will you give it to Noorie?

284
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,280
It's beautiful

285
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,320
Don't you worry. I'll give it to her

286
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,000
Look! That's Lala's daughter-in-law

287
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,480
Uncle! The Lala's daughter-in-law
is coming to your house

288
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,840
Coming to my house?

289
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,920
Give us a ladder. We're coming in

290
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,120
Greetings, Uncle Nabi.
- Lord be with you

291
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,280
Greetings. Uncle.
- Bless you.

292
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:34,440
Yusuf is from our village. To us,
he's like a son, a brother

293
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:38,600
And I'm a relative to both sides.
Noorie calls me her sister-in-law

294
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,560
I have always been
grateful to your family

295
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,160
I may be the
moneylender's daughter-in-law

296
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,280
But I haven't come here to collect

297
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,600
I'm here to ask for Noorie.
To be my daughter-in-law

298
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:56,760
You come to a pauper with gifts.
What can I give you in return?

299
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:03,520
What better a gift
than a beautiful daughter?

300
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,440
May I see the bride?

301
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,719
Yusuf is a lucky man

302
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,760
"I swear"

303
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:09,960
"Your friends are happy"

304
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:15,080
"It's your love..."

305
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:19,359
"that has drawn
your lady towards you"

306
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:23,480
"Everyone held their breath"

307
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,080
"And some hearts have burnt"

308
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,200
"Everywhere she went"

309
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:36,120
"And your lover
walked into your embrace"

310
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,360
"Now that means"

311
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,600
"Let lovers be"

312
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:46,839
"Let lovers be like them"

313
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,839
"A loving heart has found another"

314
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,600
"Love has been requited"

315
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,359
"Eyes have met"

316
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,160
"And the heartbeats match"

317
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:28,600
"Today, love has been
given a place of pride"

318
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:33,919
"He has found a beautiful bride"

319
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:47,800
"She is bound to give in"

320
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:53,240
"She is bound to give
him everything she has"

321
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:58,640
"In love, one rose makes a garden"

322
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:04,040
"One rose suffices"

323
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,640
"Let lovers be..."

324
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,759
"May they have a heart..."

325
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:13,480
"No. Let lovers be like this"

326
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,200
"May lovers..."

327
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:24,200
"May lovers be like them"

328
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:32,280
"May they have a heart like she has"

329
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:51,240
"The one who sighs is no lover"

330
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:56,200
"He who romances from a
distance is no beloved either"

331
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:00,000
"He who suffers in
silence is no lover"

332
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:04,799
"He who fears the
world is no beloved"

333
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:10,280
"To take on the world is a
matter of pride for men"

334
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:15,600
"To fall in love is for
the young and able men"

335
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:20,840
"We are in love; may
there be no disgrace"

336
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:26,319
"May we not lose our love"

337
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,880
"May lovers..."

338
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,160
"May women..."

339
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,759
"May lovers be like us"

340
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,680
"May women be like us"

341
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:46,320
"Like the legendary lovers...
may they be like them"

342
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:54,800
"Like the legendary women in
love... may they be like them"

343
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:24,440
"It's you we love"
"We are true lovers"

344
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:29,920
"Put us to test; we are love itself"

345
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,200
"To lay down our lives
we are forever ready"

346
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:40,600
"We are no outsiders;
we share your problems"

347
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:56,880
"Women awaken the magic"

348
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:02,200
"And make men in love
forget their friends"

349
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:07,360
"Love is intoxicating"

350
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:14,759
"May men be in love...
- And also remember their friends"

351
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,760
"And also remember their friends"

352
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,120
"Lovers be..."

353
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,720
"Women be..."

354
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:31,600
"May lovers be like him"

355
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,319
"May women have a heart like hers"

356
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,120
"May lovers be like him"

357
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,960
"May women have a heart like hers"

358
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:01,440
Fabulous! What a ploy!
I could kiss your feet!

359
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,600
Fabulous!

360
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:14,120
So are you getting married? When?
- Not unless you can come

361
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:18,000
That's true. Say what, Faulad?
- Without you, it shouldn't be!

362
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,920
Say, how about celebrating?
- Whenever you say

363
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,960
Make it fast, lest it becomes stale

364
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,720
Accountant...
- Yes boss?

365
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:33,840
Yusuf is getting married. His
expenses are bound to increase

366
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,359
Give him a raise. A hundred.
- Very well

367
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,720
Go on, Yusuf

368
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:45,200
Well, Faulad?
- You're great!

369
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,320
Eat a sweet!
- Why?

370
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,200
After the engagement,
my luck is changing!

371
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,840
Bashir Khan has given me a raise!
- I told you!

372
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,400
Noorie is going to
bring you much happiness!

373
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,560
I'm going to set
their lives on fire!

374
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:09,040
Before the wedding she is going to
be devastated, scarred, tainted!

375
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,880
What's on your mind?
- That bastard Gulam Nabi dies

376
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,920
And not a soul will know!

377
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,320
Mister Khairoo, get up.
Would you like some tea?

378
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:44,840
Time to get to work. Get up.
You've had enough of sleep

379
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,640
Even Abba is ready

380
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:55,200
Here's your tea. But not to hurry.
The tea is still warm

381
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:30,520
Enough now. You're getting greedier
day by day. Off you go to work

382
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,319
Bye Abba

383
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:48,520
Khairoo, stay with Abba.
I hear you're straying always

384
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,080
Who is it? It's me, Yusuf.

385
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,480
Abba isn't at home

386
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,200
Is it something important?

387
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,560
I'm here to see you

388
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:40,120
Meeting before the wedding is taboo

389
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,640
All right, I'm leaving

390
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:46,360
Come inside. If anyone
sees you, I'll get a bad name

391
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,440
Where are you?

392
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,680
What is it?

393
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,200
Can't I see you?

394
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,880
No

395
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,440
I just want to take a look at you

396
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,160
Why just a look?
- Last night, in a dream...

397
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:12,160
I saw you vanishing in a
thick cloud of winter fog...

398
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,560
I was screaming for you...

399
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,839
and you were
laughing and then you vanished

400
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:19,440
Lies!
- What do you mean?

401
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:22,240
You just made up a
story to come and see me

402
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:25,240
I'm telling you the truth!
- I won't accept

403
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:30,400
How am I to convince you?
- Try to find some other excuse

404
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:35,200
Tell me, are you all right?
- Perfectly!

405
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:39,680
You're alive, aren't you?
- And talking to you!

406
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,720
I'm no ghost! If you don't
believe me, see for yourself

407
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:49,120
That's your hand, isn't it?
- Ghosts don't have arms

408
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,919
Even if they have,
you can't see them

409
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:00,840
Now I know! That was your hand!
- You hypocrite!

410
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:03,720
And I also know that
you're perfectly all right!

411
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:07,160
Liar! Goodbye

412
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:10,840
When is the next lame excuse
coming? - This was no lame excuse!

413
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,799
Go and call Noorie

414
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:36,480
Where's Abba? Tell me, where's Abba?

415
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,960
How come you're here alone?

416
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,960
Take me along. Hurry

417
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:01,560
Have the consignment sent. His
men came asking for it thrice

418
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:05,319
Yusuf, something has happened to
Abba! Khairoo came home alone!

419
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,920
Please come with me!

420
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,800
Tell the boss I'll be back

421
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,120
I'm responsible for
Gulam Nabi's death.

422
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:16,959
I didn't know I have a black tongue

423
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,480
What I said turns out to be true!

424
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,320
Accountant...
- Yes?

425
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:25,600
Give me the papers
to Gulam Nabi's lands

426
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:31,440
He wished to be buried on his land.
But the land is mortgaged with me

427
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:40,600
My friend, I give you back your land

428
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:13,840
Khairoo, come out

429
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:17,480
Come out Khairoo

430
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,160
Khairoo, come out!

431
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,319
Khairoo, come here

432
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,200
Khairoo, come out!

433
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:58,040
Will you leave me alone, Khairoo?

434
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:02,080
You want to be buried with Abba?

435
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:06,720
Abba has left me.
Will you leave me too?

436
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:13,200
Abba didn't care for me. He
left me. Will you leave too?

437
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:18,880
Human beings do not know
what relationships are

438
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,160
Will you betray me too?

439
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:31,840
For a while, I want to
go away on a pilgrimage

440
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:37,320
I feel devastated.
Forty years of friendship.

441
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:44,560
Forty years in happiness, in sorrow,
during the weddings, in mourning

442
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:49,880
Now Gulam Nabi is gone! A
lifetime of friendship gone!

443
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:09,600
Love, how about something exciting?
- Spare me a breath, will you?

444
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:13,520
The evening has just begun!
Are you panting already?

445
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:16,000
What about the rest of the night?

446
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:23,560
Khan, you seem to be
enjoying my inconveniences

447
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:26,560
As for me, I do my bit of hard work

448
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:31,080
Hard enough to work
up a few kudos for me?

449
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:36,680
For which I pay a price.
A fair price

450
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:41,880
Who can pay a woman for her sorrows?

451
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:49,480
What of me? I dance to your tune!
I pine for you! I'd die for you!

452
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:52,799
And at heart, you wish to ruin me!

453
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:56,040
Would you rather that I refused you?

454
00:54:56,120 --> 00:55:01,480
Even if I were to escape you,
I'd be someone else's prey

455
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:05,600
So I've decided, I'd
rather die for your sake!

456
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:58,120
"If you do not know
how to appreciate"

457
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:06,560
"My beauty will go waste"

458
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:07,520
"A thirst lurks under the
shadows of my dark tresses"

459
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:17,280
"How long will I hide the
fire that burns in my heart?"

460
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:24,240
"Wonderful nights I
waste lying awake"

461
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:11,080
"You I have loved"

462
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:20,720
"Like glass on stone I am shattered"

463
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:31,400
"Oh, I was so naive"

464
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,920
"I have broken my dancing bells"

465
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:24,840
"With my henna-ed hands
folded I beg to be forgiven"

466
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:35,080
"But you will not listen"

467
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:17,359
Didn't Gulam Nabi order
some jewellery from you?

468
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:22,960
Yes, it's been lying ready for days.
I was about to deliver it to him

469
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,400
My condolences

470
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,480
That fool was a very honest man

471
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:33,200
Everyone in the village
knows about your friendship

472
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:37,960
I so deeply regret his death.

473
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,840
A dear old friend passes away...

474
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:44,320
and all one can do is mourn him.

475
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,959
Anyway, how much does he owe you?

476
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:51,040
Let's forget it. - No, the
transaction must be completed

477
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:55,920
The bill is for 900. He gave me 500

478
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,960
Here you are. Pack the ornaments

479
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:11,800
Gulam Nabi, what
you did wasn't right

480
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:16,080
You turned out to be a coward!

481
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:22,760
You took to death, and now you
rest peacefully in your grave

482
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,000
You cheat!

483
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:30,160
If you wanted to go away like this,
why did you make friends with me?

484
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:33,920
Did you find no one else in
the village to make a friend?

485
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:40,160
You fool! You should've married
your daughter off before dying!

486
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:47,839
Who?
- It's me, Lala

487
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:08,280
Come dear, sit beside me

488
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:24,320
You know, I always regarded
Gulam Nabi as my own brother

489
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:27,440
Now my brother has left me forever

490
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:32,440
The poor fellow couldn't
even have his last wish

491
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:36,400
No, my dear!

492
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:41,040
Till I am alive, I won't
let you miss your father!

493
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:45,120
I'll make all his dreams
come true. Don't you worry

494
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:51,160
Look, your Abba has left all
this jewellery for your wedding

495
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:58,400
If you ever need anything at all,
don't hesitate to come to me

496
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:00,359
Not to be ashamed at all

497
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,720
Now be brave, my child

498
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:12,200
I cannot bear to see you
cry Hush my dear, hush!

499
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:35,160
You have given me such
lovely jewellery, Abba!

500
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:40,120
You loved me so much!
You have given me so much!

501
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:46,279
You were so happy about my wedding!
Then, why did you go away?

502
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:51,720
You should've seen
how I look in these

503
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:57,680
Why did you leave, Abba?
Why did you leave me, Abba?

504
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:08,840
Yes Yusuf, what is the matter?

505
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:16,560
How can Noorie live
all alone? She has no one

506
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:23,160
Yes, she's all alone, poor thing.
She used to come here earlier

507
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:28,000
Now she doesn't even come here.
At this rate, she's going to die!

508
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:33,120
I swear by Allah, I'm not in
a hurry about getting married

509
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:37,160
I can understand your concern, Yusuf

510
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:42,160
She listens to you.
- I will visit her

511
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:43,920
I'll look after her

512
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:53,279
Who?

513
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:54,840
Your Bhabhi (Bhabhi = sister-in-law)

514
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:22,520
My Abba! I'm all alone, Bhabhi!
I have no one!

515
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:27,840
Hush you foolish girl,
hush! You have me

516
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:35,200
Abba isn't coming back, is he?

517
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:44,279
Look at the state he's in

518
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:47,520
Poor thing, he's orphaned

519
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:52,560
He used to start
barking at mealtimes.

520
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:56,440
Now he keeps lying like he's dead

521
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,800
The dead do not return.
- But the living can die

522
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:11,640
And then, how would life go on?
- I don't want it to

523
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:15,080
One has to live on,
even if one hates to live

524
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:21,839
It is in no one's hands
And time buries the wounds

525
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:26,280
Have courage

526
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:29,479
I cannot bear to see you like this

527
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:33,240
Even Yusuf is so worried for you

528
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:36,480
It's very difficult
for a woman to live alone

529
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:43,720
I have promised
Yusuf to cheer you up

530
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:50,160
Do what you want,
Bhabhi. I have no one now

531
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:55,920
Whatever way you want
me to live... I will

532
01:06:56,400 --> 01:07:00,120
Noorie, we aren't your enemies

533
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:04,680
Everyone loves you ...cares for you

534
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:07,480
I'll tell Yusuf

535
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,840
Yusuf has to be taken care of

536
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:13,840
Now that Gulam Nabi
has gone to Allah,

537
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:17,240
Yusuf stands between me and Noorie

538
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:19,560
He must be removed.
- But how?

539
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:25,240
Beat him black and blue.
- Not that easy

540
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:29,440
If the villagers get to know...
- Not one ear gets to hear this!

541
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:33,600
In the forest, when he is on
his way back from work... then!

542
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:36,560
We'll kill him, and we'll bury him!

543
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:44,640
Can't you watch your step?

544
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:49,120
Why do you have to cross my path?
- Does your father own this place?

545
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:56,000
No! You are the one whose father
owns this place! But he's dead

546
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:59,800
Did he will it to
you before he died?

547
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:03,279
What's your problem?
- You want to live in this village?

548
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:09,400
Yes, I wish to live a while longer.
- Then forget Noorie

549
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:14,920
Are you listening?
Even if you marry her...

550
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:17,319
you won't be able to match up to her

551
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:53,399
Make a promise

552
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:58,080
Never to speak Noorie's
name with your filthy tongue!

553
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:03,040
Whenever you mention Noorie...
you will be respectful

554
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:07,120
Don't you even think about Noorie!

555
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:23,959
I mentioned you, and
he used foul language...

556
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:25,519
on your mother and your sister!

557
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:30,880
It's going to be a shame. If you
can't get your hands on that girl

558
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:34,800
Now her father is no more

559
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:43,680
I've ended up with broken ribs,
for your sake. For nothing!

560
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:59,000
Will you take on everyone for my sake?
- Everyone who thinks ill of you

561
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:02,280
If need be, I'll take on the
whole village, and even God!

562
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:08,760
Love me so much, and I won't be able
to live, and I won't be able to die

563
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:12,960
I'll love you till you find
that life itself lies at your feet

564
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:15,280
And death will be unbecoming of you

565
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:23,360
And what of your own life?
What have you chosen for yourself?

566
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:26,440
Only one name Noorie

567
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:40,639
Welcome

568
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:42,376
There's some important work.
That's why I called you

569
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:44,599
Tell me.
- There's a problem

570
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:48,000
I'm telling you
because I trust you. - Sure

571
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:50,120
You know Tekchand?

572
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:51,519
He turns out to be a fraud

573
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:54,120
I've written him so many letters.
But he refuses to pay up

574
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:57,000
Can you go to the
cantonment for a few days?

575
01:11:57,720 --> 01:12:01,040
I know, you're much
taken up with your wedding

576
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:06,120
But it's urgent. Without the money,
how will I pay the lumberjacks?

577
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:08,559
Do me this favor.
- If you insist...

578
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:11,640
If you have to stay back for a
couple of days, do stay over

579
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:13,040
Make sure you bring the money

580
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:14,680
Keep this

581
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:17,960
Five hundred. A
gift for your wedding

582
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:20,440
You're getting married.
Buy something for your wife

583
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:22,360
Thanks!

584
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:35,160
I'll be back in a couple of days

585
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:39,040
I haven't the heart
to leave you alone

586
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:41,000
Then don't go

587
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:44,360
On the job, I have to obey the boss

588
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:50,640
Without you, this village
will be as empty as a desert

589
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:55,280
You're making this difficult for me.
I'll be away for only a couple of days

590
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:58,639
Very well, go

591
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:02,080
I'll make do with my dreams of you

592
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:04,080
Would you like
anything from the cantonment?

593
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:06,599
Get me whatever you like

594
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:15,120
Now which was that hand I kissed?

595
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:20,360
Oh yes!

596
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:26,840
Look, it's blushing like
a rose! You're so fragile

597
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:31,040
And in time, another rose will bud

598
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:47,840
Last bus to the Cantonment

599
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:49,200
Hurry up

600
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:52,360
Move it

601
01:13:57,400 --> 01:14:01,320
I've brought you
your bride's trousseau

602
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:03,280
Nice?

603
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:07,640
I'm your sister. And
I'm also your friend

604
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:13,000
You know, when I was given mine...

605
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:20,040
I locked myself in,
and I caressed my dress

606
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:27,880
It was as if, I could
touch my childhood dreams

607
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:32,639
May God keep you happy.
Make a home, raise a family

608
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:35,480
See you

609
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:43,599
Make sure you lock
yourself in once I'm gone

610
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:44,080
"Someone comes in stealing"

611
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:50,480
"Stealthily..."

612
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:52,840
"so that no one sees him"

613
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:57,040
"And he gives me so many dreams"

614
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:40,680
"He looks into my eyes"

615
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:45,480
"But what does he seek?"

616
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:58,640
"What am I to tell him?"

617
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:03,120
"I feel like laughing...
I don't know what to say"

618
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:08,320
"Right into my heart he gazes"

619
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:12,360
"I can scarce breathe"

620
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:55,560
"Sweet nothings"

621
01:17:56,240 --> 01:18:00,280
"Hold me spellbound"

622
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:13,480
"I am lost"

623
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:17,840
"He makes me do whatever he wants"

624
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:23,080
"When he kisses me
my heart is aflutter"

625
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:27,040
"In ecstasy, my eyes are shut"

626
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:10,040
"When I think of it"

627
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:15,040
"Such a venom he has bitten me with"

628
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:32,040
"I hope his embrace doesn't kill me"

629
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:37,400
"My heart pounds"

630
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:41,160
"I am intoxicated"

631
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:14,120
It's so cold! And
it's raining incessantly

632
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:19,360
Bring Noorie over tomorrow.
Tomorrow morning

633
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:23,240
A girl mustn't live all alone

634
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:27,400
Keep her with you
till she gets married

635
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:01,760
Leave me!

636
01:25:46,280 --> 01:25:47,400
Noorie is dead!

637
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:49,559
Someone killed her and
threw her into the river!

638
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:52,880
What are you saying?

639
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:56,040
Some people are even saying
that she committed suicide

640
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:57,200
What nonsense!

641
01:25:57,280 --> 01:26:00,240
Everyone at the village
is there beside the river.

642
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:03,040
Her dog is staring at
the river and baying

643
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:09,599
How could this happen?

644
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:20,160
First the father, then the daughter.
Strange are the ways of God

645
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:28,320
I am moving now...

646
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:29,839
God bless you

647
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:35,880
Take care of Noorie's house.
Look after Khairoo

648
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:10,000
Hello, Lala! Where are you off to?

649
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:11,880
Where have you been?

650
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:13,600
To the cantonment.
On Bashir's business

651
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:16,719
I liked a few things.
So I bought these

652
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:19,560
What do you think of this jewellery?

653
01:27:23,480 --> 01:27:24,599
What happened?

654
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:29,320
Son, how am I to tell you this?

655
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:32,040
What is the matter?

656
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:36,080
Something has gone terribly wrong.

657
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:40,280
You must have courage

658
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:44,599
I don't understand...

659
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:48,440
Noorie is no more

660
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:51,680
No more?
- She drowned herself in the river

661
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:43,360
How could this happen?

662
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:47,520
How come she killed herself?

663
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:53,719
Her life wasn't hers only

664
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:57,760
How could she just die?

665
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:01,519
How could she kill herself?

666
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:07,240
"Allah"

667
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:18,440
"His ways are strange"

668
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:21,600
"Only He knows"

669
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:24,120
"Allah knows"

670
01:29:57,800 --> 01:30:03,320
"Humans only laugh and cry"

671
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:14,160
"Where we come from, where we go..."

672
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:23,480
"why do those who
leave never return?"

673
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:31,800
"Only He knows"

674
01:30:31,880 --> 01:30:34,320
"Allah knows"

675
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:56,639
"You are The Merciful,
The Benefactor"

676
01:30:56,880 --> 01:31:01,320
"You are The
Preservator The Creator"

677
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:19,960
"Commend yourself to Him"

678
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:22,440
"For only He knows"

679
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:25,280
"Allah knows"

680
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:47,920
"He gives pain, He brings pleasure"

681
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:58,599
"If He takes away,
then He also gives"

682
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:07,600
"Many are the facets"

683
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:10,480
"Only He knows"

684
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:13,440
"Allah knows"

685
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:37,800
"First, He gives the
sinner a long rope"

686
01:32:38,360 --> 01:32:42,679
"Then He avenges the
ones who were victimized"

687
01:32:54,600 --> 01:33:02,280
"Before Him..."

688
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:06,520
"bow your heads"

689
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:09,160
"For only He knows"

690
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:12,080
"Allah knows"

691
01:37:21,880 --> 01:37:24,080
Do you know how pretty you are?

692
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:27,040
Can you tell me?

693
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:31,480
Do you know how nice you are?

694
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:34,799
Can you tell me?

695
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:41,080
You've made life difficult
for every man in the village

696
01:37:42,240 --> 01:37:44,440
Do you like me?
- Very much

697
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:47,200
For me, that's enough

698
01:37:54,640 --> 01:37:58,880
Will I be able to live without you?
I don't believe I can...

699
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:03,200
Why are you screaming in
the middle of the night?

700
01:40:03,720 --> 01:40:06,400
What has come over you?
- What do you mean?

701
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:10,600
What nonsense is this?
- You just shot your own dog

702
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:16,280
Noorie's dog was outside, baying.
Your "Tiger" was giving it chase

703
01:40:16,360 --> 01:40:17,719
And you shot him

704
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:30,560
Do you know where Faulad lives?
- Yes

705
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:32,880
Ask him to come and
see me tomorrow morning

706
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:38,600
Are you all right?
- What's wrong with me?

707
01:40:39,080 --> 01:40:40,600
Looks like...
- Looks like what?

708
01:40:41,320 --> 01:40:44,320
Your face is dry, pallid.
Tell me, should I call a doctor?

709
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:48,920
No need for a doctor! Go away.
Tell Faulad to see me in the morning

710
01:40:49,160 --> 01:40:50,320
Very well

711
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:08,640
Faulad... welcome!

712
01:41:09,320 --> 01:41:10,440
Sit

713
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:16,759
Faulad, there's a job

714
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:19,080
I'd lay down my life for it!

715
01:41:19,720 --> 01:41:23,360
For a few days, I've
been a bit superstitious

716
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:27,000
Superstitious?
- That dog...

717
01:41:27,080 --> 01:41:29,480
Noorie's!
- How do you know?

718
01:41:29,560 --> 01:41:33,080
The whole village is
talking about it. It has gone mad

719
01:41:33,160 --> 01:41:36,080
It's roaming the lanes and the alleys,
as if it is searching for someone

720
01:41:37,680 --> 01:41:38,840
Searching?

721
01:41:40,280 --> 01:41:42,120
For whom?
- God knows

722
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:47,639
Some say, dogs can see spirits and
they even see the Angel of Death...

723
01:41:47,720 --> 01:41:50,040
when it arrives to take someone.
That's why they bay

724
01:41:50,600 --> 01:41:53,640
Angel of Death?
- People say that...

725
01:41:53,720 --> 01:41:56,040
a dog baying at night means
that someone is about to die

726
01:41:56,760 --> 01:41:57,920
Is that so?

727
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,800
But... what is the matter?

728
01:42:01,160 --> 01:42:06,760
Last night, that dog was
standing outside my house and baying

729
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:10,200
God forbid...
- I'm not afraid or anything

730
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:12,840
But last night it ruined my sleep

731
01:42:12,920 --> 01:42:14,800
Why did it come to your house?

732
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:18,040
God only knows!

733
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:19,879
Why don't you just kill the dog?

734
01:42:21,080 --> 01:42:24,480
Can it be killed?
- Why not? It's only a dog!

735
01:42:24,720 --> 01:42:29,760
Just buy some meat from the butcher
and poison it. He's going to eat it

736
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:32,320
And that's about the end of it

737
01:42:32,720 --> 01:42:34,840
Will it be done today?

738
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:38,520
Why today? Right now!
I'm off to buy meat

739
01:42:38,600 --> 01:42:40,840
When they find him,
he'll be a carcass

740
01:42:40,920 --> 01:42:43,360
I'll have the
carcass thrown in the water

741
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:12,320
For all the tall talk,
you can't do as little!

742
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:14,600
Had it been a tiger or a cheetah,
I could understand

743
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:18,320
It's just a mad, half-dead dog!
And you can't even kill it!

744
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:20,719
What could I do? He
sniffed at it, and he slunk away

745
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:24,320
The devil has gotten him!
- What?!

746
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:26,480
Yes! I've heard about it.

747
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:30,280
The Satan possesses animals,
and hunts his prey

748
01:44:30,360 --> 01:44:32,920
Prey... what prey?

749
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:37,240
How would I know? A dog refuses
meat! Now, has that ever happened?

750
01:44:37,320 --> 01:44:40,440
And that too, a dog who
has been hungry for days

751
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:42,280
What nonsense are you talking?!

752
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:44,520
This is just a
story you've dreamt up!

753
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:49,520
If he won't eat, stone him to
death! Chase him out of the village!

754
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,360
Pay the lads in the village.
Get them to kill it!

755
01:44:52,640 --> 01:44:54,600
It's a mad dog! It
might bite someone!

756
01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:57,200
Keep it. Spend what you want

757
01:44:57,960 --> 01:44:59,440
I don't want any more excuses

758
01:45:14,720 --> 01:45:17,840
Stop it! What are you
fellows doing? Aren't you ashamed?

759
01:45:17,920 --> 01:45:22,720
You're stoning an innocent mutt!
Have you no sympathy, no mercy?

760
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:25,440
Are you not even
afraid of God's punishment?

761
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:27,360
Is he not God's creation?

762
01:45:27,760 --> 01:45:30,680
Is it humane to kill this dog?

763
01:45:30,760 --> 01:45:31,840
Go, drown yourselves!

764
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:34,600
Go, drown yourselves in shame!

765
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:51,120
The dead never return, Khairoo

766
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,120
Human that I am, I
have forgotten her

767
01:45:56,440 --> 01:45:58,919
But you the beast...
you're still mourning her

768
01:46:00,920 --> 01:46:02,840
Is there something you know?

769
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:06,960
Is there a secret
that's killing you?

770
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,720
You've stayed hungry, thirsty

771
01:46:10,720 --> 01:46:12,800
You're stoned, and yet
you do not utter a sound

772
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:15,440
Forget, Khairoo

773
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:29,800
"I'm not far away"

774
01:46:29,880 --> 01:46:31,960
"I'm with you"

775
01:46:32,040 --> 01:46:35,840
"Forever, I'm yours"

776
01:46:44,640 --> 01:46:48,520
"I have only to look at you"

777
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:52,160
"You bring me good luck"

778
01:46:53,080 --> 01:46:55,200
"Come to me"

779
01:46:55,280 --> 01:47:03,280
"Come into my heart
Arouse my passions"

780
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:34,760
Noorie! She has been found!

781
01:48:02,360 --> 01:48:03,759
Noorie has been found!

782
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:07,440
What nonsense! Have you gone mad?
- Really! Noorie has been found!

783
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:10,880
It's been ages since she died!
Even her corpse wasn't found!

784
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:15,080
They've found it! By the river.
The whole village is headed there

785
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:18,080
And she doesn't
look like she's dead!

786
01:48:18,160 --> 01:48:19,920
It's as if Noorie is alive, smiling!

787
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:23,080
Like an immaculate soul. The
entire village is worked up

788
01:48:23,160 --> 01:48:24,520
They're dying to solve the murder!

789
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:25,680
As soon as they get to know

790
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:27,496
they're going to tear
the murderer to pieces!

791
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:29,480
I'd rather get lost

792
01:48:29,560 --> 01:48:32,960
Else, I might end up with
a broken head for nothing!

793
01:48:33,040 --> 01:48:35,519
I've had nothing to do
with this! Goodbye, Khan

794
01:49:33,400 --> 01:49:37,200
It's been so many
days since I saw you

795
01:49:38,720 --> 01:49:43,240
I searched everywhere,
I've been looking for you

796
01:49:45,120 --> 01:49:47,480
Where have you been?
You left me all alone

797
01:49:49,160 --> 01:49:51,240
You left me all
alone and you went away

798
01:54:52,440 --> 01:54:55,240
It's all over now

799
01:54:57,040 --> 01:55:01,360
Even if I were to have lived,
what life would it have been?

800
01:55:02,680 --> 01:55:06,880
Without love, how
could I have lived?

801
01:55:08,560 --> 01:55:12,800
Without Noorie, how can I live?

802
01:55:14,880 --> 01:55:19,440
"Why do those who
leave never return?"

803
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:22,400
"Only He knows"

804
01:55:22,480 --> 01:55:25,000
"Allah knows"
