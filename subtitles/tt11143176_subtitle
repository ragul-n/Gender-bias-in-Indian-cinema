14
00:02:31,714 --> 00:02:34,425
Catching without knowing is not wrong

15
00:02:35,597 --> 00:02:37,933
Catching us even after knowing us

16
00:02:38,885 --> 00:02:39,885
Is wrong

17
00:02:42,404 --> 00:02:44,784

Loaded gun is here

23
00:03:19,894 --> 00:03:20,925
Option is yours

24
00:03:22,122 --> 00:03:23,402
Are you scaring me?

25
00:03:27,914 --> 00:03:30,089
This is the problem with loyal dogs

26
00:03:31,297 --> 00:03:32,698
It doesn't eat bun

27
00:03:34,244 --> 00:03:35,730
And is not scared of gun

28
00:03:37,015 --> 00:03:38,486
Think of it once again

29
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:42,448
Whether you will stop tomorrow's bulletin

30
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:46,113
Or will you stop the bullet
that will trigger now

31
00:03:47,796 --> 00:03:49,892
Your time starts now

32
00:04:03,907 --> 00:04:04,907
Gabriel

33
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:06,813
Don't leave anything

34
00:04:07,411 --> 00:04:09,103
Clear all the evidence

35
00:04:11,606 --> 00:04:13,982
He has learnt everything about me

36
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:17,899
Go and check

37
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,516

38
00:04:36,797 --> 00:04:39,790
Whole state is in shock

39
00:04:39,815 --> 00:04:45,876
Weekly magazine and news channelís
chief editorís family is been murdered

40
00:04:45,901 --> 00:04:52,393
And the case is handled by Pratap Mishra

41
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:57,024

42
00:05:38,877 --> 00:05:39,423
Sir

43
00:05:39,898 --> 00:05:41,556
Criminal has not left even a small trace

44
00:05:41,935 --> 00:05:43,713
I think he is smart

45
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,766
Sir did you got any evidence

46
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:35,713
Sir did you get any information
about who is behind this murder?

47
00:06:36,201 --> 00:06:37,815
Investigation is on going

48
00:06:38,025 --> 00:06:40,682
I can't tell you more about it
thank you

49
00:06:45,411 --> 00:06:46,411
What is that?

50
00:06:46,846 --> 00:06:47,518
Sir

51
00:06:47,767 --> 00:06:50,587
He has murdered without
leaving a small trace

52
00:06:51,085 --> 00:06:54,315
You might find it hard to solve

53
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:01,981
Snake can escape from ten people

54
00:07:02,598 --> 00:07:04,910
But it can't escape from eagle

55
00:07:15,192 --> 00:07:16,893
Inspector Vikram

56
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:21,043
Name itself tells that he is young,
energetic and naughty

57
00:07:21,068 --> 00:07:26,902
And Dynamic adds more
stars to his credentials

58
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:45,924
Who has the guts to arreset
me in that department?!

59
00:07:45,949 --> 00:07:49,535
I have seen people saying this
falling on Vikram's feet

60
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:55,267
He is the epitome of loyalty

61
00:07:55,292 --> 00:08:00,307
Vikram is known for his honesty
and ruthlesness

62
00:08:00,332 --> 00:08:06,899
Come let's have a look at Vikram's new face

63
00:08:38,271 --> 00:08:43,587
You think yourself the Dynamic Star Devraj!

64
00:08:43,612 --> 00:08:47,351
Think I'm his son Prajwal Devaraj

65
00:08:47,376 --> 00:08:50,914
Dad can make you lock up death
His son can give you spot death

66
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:52,998
Beath him

67
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:01,906
What do you want?
- No police

68
00:09:02,355 --> 00:09:04,599
You don't know about me

69
00:09:04,624 --> 00:09:07,813
You don't know what a terror
this Kambi Krishna is

70
00:09:08,009 --> 00:09:11,149
If you get to know, you will come
and fall on my feet

71
00:09:11,314 --> 00:09:14,117
You will come and fall on my feet

72
00:09:17,446 --> 00:09:21,734
I don't fall on anybody's feet
nor do I pull anybody's leg

73
00:09:24,483 --> 00:09:27,711
Doesn't fall on anybody's feet nor
pull anybody's leg

74
00:09:28,184 --> 00:09:32,117
Critics have long tongue
Crabs have long arms

75
00:09:32,391 --> 00:09:33,945
Come on

76
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,906
Hey brother come outside

77
00:12:33,013 --> 00:12:35,547

Our officer

79
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:46,000
Inspector Vikram

80
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:50,250
Second Kohinoor Diamond
of Karnataka police department

81
00:12:50,274 --> 00:12:53,179
'Inspector Vikram'

82
00:12:56,628 --> 00:12:57,218
Sir

83
00:12:57,637 --> 00:12:59,023
What?
Who is first?

84
00:12:59,216 --> 00:13:01,008
Don't you know that much?

85
00:13:01,432 --> 00:13:02,930
Hattrick hero

86
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,312
Karunada Chakravarti

87
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,515
Dr Shivaraj Kumar

88
00:13:10,285 --> 00:13:18,285
Women were not able to work here care-free!
Thank you for saving us from them

89
00:13:18,767 --> 00:13:19,812
Do not cry

90
00:13:20,381 --> 00:13:24,195
More you cry more people exploit you

91
00:13:24,813 --> 00:13:28,586
You being men why didn't you question him?

92
00:13:28,611 --> 00:13:30,711
How can we go against them?

93
00:13:32,506 --> 00:13:34,578
This is your biggest problem

94
00:13:35,156 --> 00:13:40,429
You waste your life thinking
you are helpless

95
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:45,695
You being washermen
why didn't you wash him away?

96
00:13:47,709 --> 00:13:53,414
If hard workers unite
no perverts can stand before you

97
00:13:55,332 --> 00:13:57,052
I will tell you something keep this in mind

98
00:13:57,655 --> 00:14:00,783
Unity is symbol of strength

99
00:14:01,711 --> 00:14:03,711
What say?
True Sir

100
00:14:05,848 --> 00:14:07,586
May I come in Sir?
- Come in

101
00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:12,289
Vikram you are not a college boy anymore
Have a clean shave man

102
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:14,926
Now, what you have to do is

103
00:14:15,086 --> 00:14:16,391
Rock on and have fun?

104
00:14:16,931 --> 00:14:17,617
What?

105
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:22,183
I have applied leave for three days
and leave got sanctioned

106
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,461
My leave started two hours ago

107
00:14:24,486 --> 00:14:26,453
Kambi Krishna is also behind the bars

108
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,906
Work while you work
Party while you party

109
00:14:29,086 --> 00:14:30,210
Now it's party time

110
00:14:30,235 --> 00:14:30,951

111
00:14:30,976 --> 00:14:33,250
Hey wait Vikram
after three day's

112
00:14:39,276 --> 00:14:41,937
You have grown it so well

113
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:44,929
How come you are always so happy Sir?

114
00:14:45,221 --> 00:14:47,804
It is very easy to be
happy in life Ranganna

115
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:50,617
We should not be jealous
of people ahead of us

116
00:14:50,994 --> 00:14:54,218
And looking people behind us
we should not feel great too

117
00:14:54,601 --> 00:14:57,093
We should not lose people who are with us

118
00:14:57,501 --> 00:15:00,559
Follow these three things,
life will be happy

119
00:15:00,584 --> 00:15:04,268
Sir, though you are young
there is so much to learn from you

120
00:15:04,292 --> 00:15:06,711

Do you know why I cut down your leave

130
00:19:36,138 --> 00:19:37,970
You invited me to your anniversary treat

131
00:19:38,475 --> 00:19:39,267
Not that

132
00:19:39,292 --> 00:19:40,292
Then?

133
00:19:40,407 --> 00:19:43,034
To give you one important drug
investigation case

134
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,238
You need to go to Manipal immediately

135
00:19:45,263 --> 00:19:46,483
Okay uncle I will leave

00:19:46,508 --> 00:19:48,592

Okay

139
00:19:53,518 --> 00:19:56,127
Just a moment Home minister's PA

00:19:57,182 --> 00:19:58,807
Hello, tell me Sir duty is it

What else aunty?
Wedding day special?

143
00:20:04,891 --> 00:20:08,705
He remembers the day and is with me
that itself is special

144
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:09,883
Nothing like that Aunty

145
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:11,908
Uncle always keeps remembering you

146
00:20:11,933 --> 00:20:13,545
He always keeps telling me

147
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:15,975
That "me and my wife have
so many similarities"

148
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,706
Is it? what did he say?

149
00:20:18,204 --> 00:20:20,810
Those who get beaten
up by me and people Who

150
00:20:20,834 --> 00:20:23,440
Eat my wife's food
get admitted to hospital

151
00:20:23,632 --> 00:20:24,869
Did he say that?

152
00:20:24,894 --> 00:20:26,854
But he likes what I cook

153
00:20:26,879 --> 00:20:29,331
Then he always parks his vehicle
near Indira Canteen

154
00:20:29,531 --> 00:20:30,917
Inidira Canteen?

155
00:20:31,117 --> 00:20:33,599
One day near Indira Canteen,
one day near Appaji canteen

156
00:20:33,624 --> 00:20:36,510
These days he keeps saying
that he needs change

157
00:20:36,703 --> 00:20:38,043
Do you know what he said recently?

158
00:20:38,067 --> 00:20:39,067
What did he say?

159
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,026
No Aunty that's okay

160
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:42,851
That's okay tell me Vikram

161
00:20:42,876 --> 00:20:43,876
Is it so?

162
00:20:44,797 --> 00:20:47,639
Like we change dp in WhatsApp

163
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:51,010
It would be nice if we could change dp
in real life is what he said

164
00:20:51,224 --> 00:20:52,127
Dp means what?

165
00:20:52,152 --> 00:20:53,331
Dharma patni (Wife)

166
00:20:53,513 --> 00:20:54,627
Did he say like that?

167
00:20:56,085 --> 00:20:59,366
He has never spoke to me like that
- aunty

168
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,424
Husbands speak only twice

169
00:21:01,496 --> 00:21:03,127
One is when he is drunk

170
00:21:03,152 --> 00:21:04,706
Or when wife is gone out

171
00:21:05,107 --> 00:21:08,424
No matter what you be careful Aunty

172
00:21:08,787 --> 00:21:09,787
Is it?

173
00:21:10,818 --> 00:21:13,424
He always keep saying that he needs change

174
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:16,026
What if he changes you?

175
00:21:18,307 --> 00:21:19,307
Vikram

176
00:21:20,008 --> 00:21:21,008

Thank you

183
00:21:40,214 --> 00:21:41,214
Vikram

184
00:21:41,442 --> 00:21:43,924
Everytime we come to this hotel
on our wedding day

185
00:21:43,949 --> 00:21:45,245
We would sit in that table

186
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,932
This time for a change we

She captured my heart instantly.

369
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:12,416
Madam, insert this in my phone.

370
00:36:13,909 --> 00:36:17,120
This is not just a sim.
But my heart.

371
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:18,516
Take it.

372
00:36:32,886 --> 00:36:35,079
How many time will you call me?
Put down the phone

373
00:36:35,104 --> 00:36:36,278
Gosh my phone.

374
00:36:39,086 --> 00:36:47,221
Sir forgive us Sir.
We won't repeat it Sir.

375
00:36:48,698 --> 00:36:49,682
Sit.

376
00:36:55,271 --> 00:36:56,377
Tell me who is your boss.

377
00:36:57,413 --> 00:36:58,784
That is...

378
00:37:00,627 --> 00:37:02,658
Do not test my patience.

379
00:37:03,182 --> 00:37:07,510
I'm a short tempered man.
Don't try to mess with me.

380
00:37:08,707 --> 00:37:10,666
You will have to face hell otherwise.

381
00:37:10,691 --> 00:37:11,927
Tell me who is your boss.

382
00:37:11,952 --> 00:37:16,172
Sir there is nobody as boss.
It gets exchanged hand to hand.

383
00:37:16,197 --> 00:37:20,365
He gives it to me.
I distribute it outside Sir.

384
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:22,390
I don't know other than that Sir.

385
00:37:22,415 --> 00:37:25,682
I cover college hostel and pubs.

386
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:28,041
Jumper Ravi takes care of
Market and Bus stand.

387
00:37:28,066 --> 00:37:30,635
Chirate Shankar takes care of.
Bar pan and rev.

Copper Chandra handles outskirts party.
and foreign customers.

389
00:37:34,692 --> 00:37:35,940
That is all we know Sir.

390
00:37:38,616 --> 00:37:39,705
Good boy.

391
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:41,909
Basava.
Order tea for the boys.

392
00:37:43,913 --> 00:37:46,471
Sir you are getting call for
the sim you gave.

393
00:37:48,604 --> 00:37:50,112
Hello.
- Hi.

394
00:37:50,706 --> 00:37:55,877
I lost my mobile in the fair.

395
00:37:56,702 --> 00:37:58,518
I got lost in the fair too.

396
00:37:58,694 --> 00:37:59,323
What?

397
00:38:00,605 --> 00:38:03,182
I mean, I lost my phone too.

398
00:38:05,069 --> 00:38:07,745
Could you please meet to give my phone?

399
00:38:08,563 --> 00:38:11,635
I'm too busy right now
Tomorrow ok?

400
00:38:12,502 --> 00:38:15,079
Are you okay with
tomorrow morning?

401
00:38:15,104 --> 00:38:18,010
Tomorrow come down to MGM road.

402
00:38:18,868 --> 00:38:19,932
Okay bye.

403
00:38:20,695 --> 00:38:23,518
Basu, when will tomorrow come?

404
00:38:25,009 --> 00:38:30,315
I got details of Jumper Ravi.
Copper Chandra and Chirate Shankar.

405
00:38:30,821 --> 00:38:34,830
It is already so late.
But I haven't got her call yet.

406
00:38:35,709 --> 00:38:38,901
Sir this is Bhavana.
I'm on MGM road.

407
00:38:39,854 --> 00:38:41,076
Even we are here.

408
00:38:41,905 --> 00:38:43,807
What is there before you?

409
00:38:44,285 --> 00:38:48,401
I can see Sunny Deol.

410
00:38:48,638 --> 00:38:49,698
Ok.

411
00:38:50,595 --> 00:38:53,591
We can see Sunny Leone from here.

412
00:38:53,616 --> 00:38:56,237
Sunny leone!
Then we might be somewhere close.

413
00:38:56,507 --> 00:38:58,791
Come let's look for Sunny leone.

414
00:39:07,127 --> 00:39:09,014
Sir have you seen Sunny Leone?

415
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:11,674
I see her everyday.
Switch on Share it I will send you.

416
00:39:11,699 --> 00:39:13,447
I asked if you saw her poster.

417
00:39:13,472 --> 00:39:15,627
You don't leave her poster as well!

418
00:39:16,218 --> 00:39:16,970
Get lost.

419
00:39:17,189 --> 00:39:19,495
Because of you she's such demand.

420
00:39:19,688 --> 00:39:21,506
What kind of this?
- Hi.

421
00:39:22,291 --> 00:39:23,077
It's him!

422
00:39:24,791 --> 00:39:28,830
Inspector Vikram - Second Kohinoor diamond
of Karnataka's police department.

423
00:39:28,855 --> 00:39:30,510
Give me my phone I need to make a move.

424
00:39:31,881 --> 00:39:38,713
I thought you will be
very thankful and sorry.

425
00:39:38,738 --> 00:39:40,721
But you seem to be in hurry.

426
00:39:40,953 --> 00:39:45,237
Come lets have coffee and talk

427
00:39:45,385 --> 00:39:49,199
We don't know each other
but you are inviting me for coffee!

428
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,256
Just a cup of coffee!
I'm not asking you to booze with me!

429
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:57,221
Okay I'm getting late
give me my phone

430
00:39:59,589 --> 00:40:06,213
Time! I remember now! We saw each other
Exactly at 11.46am right?

431
00:40:07,296 --> 00:40:08,744
May be! So what?

432
00:40:08,769 --> 00:40:10,830
Not may be! For sure

433
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:14,612
You wore white chudidhar
Bindi on forehead and no mehendi on palm

434
00:40:14,637 --> 00:40:16,995
Kajol applied and bangle wore on one hand

435
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:19,221
No pimple on face
And simple makeup

436
00:40:19,246 --> 00:40:21,291
There was a bald-head standing next to you

437
00:40:21,413 --> 00:40:24,307
You are the example for
how a girl should be

438
00:40:25,815 --> 00:40:27,643
How much you talk!

439
00:40:27,668 --> 00:40:30,807
Mother kannada is our treasure
that is why I talk so much

440
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:34,108
You know who is the treasure of Kannada?
No-one other than our Maasti

441
00:40:36,739 --> 00:40:38,870
You are talking so irrelevant

442
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:40,311
See we are now lovers

443
00:40:40,505 --> 00:40:44,010
Lovers? Hello
Are you in your senses?

444
00:40:44,035 --> 00:40:46,385
When did we become lovers?
- Since I saw you yesterday

445
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:49,034
I'm not in love with you
- But I'm in love with you

446
00:40:49,059 --> 00:40:51,267
But I won't accept it
- I will convince you

447
00:40:51,292 --> 00:40:52,128
Is it fine?

448
00:40:52,928 --> 00:41:00,816
What if you ask me what
you were wearing on the

449
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:08,729
first day and I don't
answer and you break up?

450
00:41:09,824 --> 00:41:17,112
You girls are good at make up and break up
So I've studied you thoroughly

451
00:41:17,137 --> 00:41:20,307
You have gone mad!
Give back my phone

452
00:41:23,713 --> 00:41:25,116
What about my phone?

453
00:41:25,592 --> 00:41:28,291
This is all left from the crash!

454
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:35,307
This is not just sim card
But my heart! Take care of it

455
00:41:39,077 --> 00:41:39,913
Disgusting!

456
00:41:41,101 --> 00:41:42,800
Ma'am atleast you give that.

457
00:45:44,304 --> 00:45:47,207
I'm missing my girl friend a lot today

458
00:45:48,703 --> 00:45:50,700
You saw her yesterday

459
00:45:51,609 --> 00:45:52,637
Yesterday?

460
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:55,903
Feels like a millennium has passed

461
00:45:56,828 --> 00:45:59,824
I will call her once
It will make me feel good

462
00:46:04,521 --> 00:46:05,948
Hello
- Who is this?

463
00:46:06,194 --> 00:46:07,769
It is me Inspector Vikram

464
00:46:07,832 --> 00:46:10,348
You? How did you get my number?

465
00:46:10,373 --> 00:46:11,749
It is me who gave you the sim right?

466
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:15,481
Why do you guys die for girl's number?

467
00:46:17,211 --> 00:46:23,926
Parents pressurise boys in school days
to get numbers like girls

468
00:46:24,484 --> 00:46:29,114
We can't take number like girls
So thought to take number from girl

469
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:32,834
However you are number one in scoring
And we are good in running away with you

470
00:46:33,233 --> 00:46:33,897
What did you say?

471
00:46:34,283 --> 00:46:37,864
Nothing! Where are you now?

472
00:46:37,889 --> 00:46:39,597
Why do you want to know?

473
00:46:46,139 --> 00:46:47,184
Let's go

474
00:46:56,421 --> 00:47:00,129
So, you gave a thought on my love proposal?

475
00:47:00,712 --> 00:47:02,395
What do you know about me?

476
00:47:03,203 --> 00:47:09,743
I don't need to know anything
You took my breath way which is enough

477
00:47:09,791 --> 00:47:13,075
How can you fall in love at first sight?

478
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:18,043
Love is not like giving birth to a baby!

479
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:23,776
Love is a sweet enemy which attacks
without giving any hint

480
00:47:24,597 --> 00:47:30,254
You woe us in the becoming
and ditch us later

481
00:47:30,524 --> 00:47:32,965
You just use in the name of love

482
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:35,215
Hello madam
Take back your words

483
00:47:35,591 --> 00:47:42,590
Girls love lasts till you marry someone
else But our goes to our grave with us

484
00:47:42,615 --> 00:47:48,309
Your love lasts till you see
another beautiful girl

485
00:47:48,677 --> 00:47:53,512
But I'm not that kind of a guy!
I'm a dedicated loyal lover!

486
00:47:54,048 --> 00:47:54,699
What say!?

487
00:48:22,877 --> 00:48:26,340
Do you know where is
Karanji Venugopala Swamy temple?

488
00:48:56,814 --> 00:48:57,606
Sorry

489
00:48:58,912 --> 00:49:01,106
First right
Second left

490
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:04,325
Thank you
- Welcome

491
00:49:13,974 --> 00:49:15,418
She is beautiful, isn't it?

492
00:49:16,107 --> 00:49:18,309
She's damn beautiful!

493
00:49:18,803 --> 00:49:20,895
Why don't you get married to her?!

494
00:49:21,921 --> 00:49:25,418
I'm already married to her
How many times should I get married?

495
00:49:25,926 --> 00:49:26,594
What?

496
00:49:28,446 --> 00:49:35,309
I mean I'm married to you already

497
00:49:35,334 --> 00:49:39,121
Oh just shut up!
I saw your jaw dropped face

498
00:49:39,146 --> 00:49:45,317
Though we admire Taj Mahal
We don't reside in it, right?

499
00:49:45,575 --> 00:49:52,200
Please understand! I don't love anyone else

500
00:49:52,225 --> 00:49:53,106
Please love me

501
00:49:53,708 --> 00:49:55,317
Never! Let's go

502
00:49:59,924 --> 00:50:02,723
Sir, she's testing your steel

503
00:50:03,178 --> 00:50:05,941
Strong steel lasts for long

504
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:12,490
Youths these days think narcotics
is the new trend and eventually die

505
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:14,534
You must try and understand

506
00:50:14,698 --> 00:50:17,610
Hello mister, why have you jammed
the traffic in peak hours?

507
00:50:17,635 --> 00:50:20,099
Being a police man you are
troubling the public

508
00:50:20,124 --> 00:50:21,427
That's not our intention

509
00:50:22,297 --> 00:50:22,965
But

510
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:28,074
You are thinking about the hundred people
who are stuck in this jam

511
00:50:28,099 --> 00:50:28,767
But I

512
00:50:28,767 --> 00:50:32,359
I'm thinking about the youths
Who are trapped in drug mafia

513
00:50:32,384 --> 00:50:36,857
Well, do you think a public speech
Will transform everyone?

514
00:50:37,033 --> 00:50:37,825
It might not work

515
00:50:38,641 --> 00:50:41,271
But if you spread the message
to four people

516
00:50:41,488 --> 00:50:43,044
Then they will spread it to others

517
00:50:43,914 --> 00:50:45,114
It's the time to wake up

518
00:50:46,525 --> 00:50:50,567
If you find any drug addict immediately
admit them to Rehabilitation centre

519
00:50:50,829 --> 00:50:54,575
or if you find any drug petler
then inform the police immediately

520
00:50:56,488 --> 00:50:58,652
This is not something only police can do

521
00:50:59,243 --> 00:51:00,857
We need public support as well

522
00:51:01,328 --> 00:51:04,497
Unity is the strength

523
00:51:04,915 --> 00:51:05,599
Yes

524
00:51:22,002 --> 00:51:24,099
Vikram, congrats

525
00:51:24,615 --> 00:51:26,136
You have become the talk of the town

526
00:51:26,161 --> 00:51:29,083
the massage you delivered has gone viral

527
00:51:29,108 --> 00:51:30,820
without your support it wouldn't
have been possible

528
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:34,170
your effort is more than my support

529
00:51:34,929 --> 00:51:37,310
wait a minute
Pratap Mishra wants to talk to you

530
00:51:39,122 --> 00:51:40,919
Hello Mr Second Kohinoor diamond

531
00:51:41,299 --> 00:51:41,927
Hello sir

532
00:51:42,508 --> 00:51:44,577
I'm really feeling seeing Vikram's progress

533
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:45,478
Congratulations

534
00:51:46,192 --> 00:51:47,333
wish you all the best

535
00:51:47,718 --> 00:51:48,218
thank you Slr

536
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:53,091
I'm really feeling bad about myself
seeing Vikram's progress

537
00:51:53,439 --> 00:51:54,091
why?

538
00:51:55,317 --> 00:51:58,732
I still haven't solved
Arvinda Aradhya's case

539
00:51:59,513 --> 00:52:01,067
Few cases are like that

540
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:02,512
Don't worry it will be solved

541
00:52:04,011 --> 00:52:05,911
Sir his entire family got wiped off

542
00:52:06,716 --> 00:52:08,497
If I get my hands on those criminals

543
00:52:08,522 --> 00:52:10,817
I will make them rot in jail till the end

544
00:52:12,807 --> 00:52:13,435
excuse me Sir

545
00:52:19,009 --> 00:52:21,841
Why you get tensed for just a coin?

546
00:52:22,677 --> 00:52:23,403
Just?

547
00:52:25,025 --> 00:52:26,107
Please excuse me sir

548
00:52:26,807 --> 00:52:28,552
Can I have an one rupee from you?

549
00:52:29,796 --> 00:52:30,410
What?

550
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:32,505
Please sir give me

551
00:52:37,505 --> 00:52:39,075
You just gave it without any second thought

552
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:45,802
Earn one rupee right now

553
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:47,607
You can't sir

554
00:52:48,802 --> 00:52:52,950
it is easy to lose money
But it is difficult to earn

555
00:52:53,901 --> 00:52:57,005
You can sign a five crore rupees cheque

556
00:52:57,708 --> 00:53:02,028
But you can't buy a pen by showing
one crore rupee cheque

557
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:07,021
each penny has its own value

558
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:09,708
I love money

559
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:13,325
Sorry sir

560
00:53:13,993 --> 00:53:16,301
I'm still younger than you
But I spoke too much

561
00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:17,846
Not too much!

562
00:53:18,782 --> 00:53:19,862
Very well said in fact

563
00:53:20,496 --> 00:53:21,120
Come let's go

564
00:53:21,435 --> 00:53:22,200
take it sir

565
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:27,513
when shall we plan for engagement?

566
00:53:28,114 --> 00:53:29,882
Are you nuts?

567
00:53:29,907 --> 00:53:33,575
I don't want to fall in love
I obey my parents regarding my marriage

568
00:53:33,789 --> 00:53:34,369
wow

569
00:53:34,394 --> 00:53:35,482
Wow! Let me tell you one thing

570
00:53:35,624 --> 00:53:37,450
You must upgrade with the changing time

571
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,817
In those days they used to find
a good date to marry

572
00:53:40,197 --> 00:53:42,016
Now people date first and then marry

573
00:53:42,041 --> 00:53:43,680
Change is the only constant

574
00:53:43,705 --> 00:53:47,166
Look, I'm telling you for the last time
I don't like this

575
00:53:47,191 --> 00:53:51,074
My thoughts and roots differ from yours
We can't stand on a common ground

576
00:53:51,099 --> 00:53:54,683
What is the fun
if the same wavelength people join hands?

577
00:53:54,708 --> 00:53:57,622
True love is when you fall in love
with your contrast

578
00:54:01,099 --> 00:54:02,513
Sorry, its the duty call

579
00:54:05,099 --> 00:54:07,282
King and minister are here for the deal

580
00:54:07,307 --> 00:54:08,242
Are you sure?

581
00:54:08,267 --> 00:54:09,982
Hundred percent sir

582
00:54:12,333 --> 00:54:14,950
I've to go on some work

583
00:54:15,215 --> 00:54:16,826
Let's do one thing

584
00:54:16,905 --> 00:54:20,622
No need of any engagement
I will directly come and tie you knots

585
00:54:20,908 --> 00:54:22,521
Okay!? Bye

586
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:24,919
My god!

587
00:54:38,302 --> 00:54:39,470
Bloody this fellow!?

588
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:46,497
Bloody double cross
You call yourself a drug dealer?

589
00:54:46,522 --> 00:54:50,990
He seems like has offered
his hair to see me

590
00:54:51,218 --> 00:54:52,162
Correct boss

591
00:54:53,413 --> 00:54:55,155
Hello I'm Tony

592
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:56,326
I'm Jhony

593
00:54:56,351 --> 00:54:57,326
He is Stephen

594
00:54:57,351 --> 00:54:58,584
Tiffin

595
00:54:58,609 --> 00:55:00,772
Not tiffin.. He is Stephen

596
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:05,295
Tiffin! Why he has named
himself after breakfast?

597
00:55:05,591 --> 00:55:07,175
You don't know English!? Shit

598
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,118
Hello you don't know Kannada!? Oh shit

599
00:55:10,498 --> 00:55:12,119
Sir you are talking vulgar!

600
00:55:12,144 --> 00:55:17,453
Why did you keep quiet when
he said the same?

601
00:55:17,478 --> 00:55:22,217
Mr Johny, we never expected
such a poor performance from your side

602
00:55:22,537 --> 00:55:24,490
Why drug sale is so less?

603
00:55:24,515 --> 00:55:27,326
Ask my right hand to come here

604
00:55:27,653 --> 00:55:29,764
Her English will handle him

605
00:55:30,432 --> 00:55:32,826
He too has a right hand and a partner!?

606
00:55:44,118 --> 00:55:46,242
What a twist my god!

607
00:55:46,267 --> 00:55:47,618
Hi
- Hi

608
00:55:47,705 --> 00:55:56,522
Mona, tell him in your English that
His boss is a coward and impotent

609
00:55:56,683 --> 00:56:01,137
They said they will
provide distributors and drug

610
00:56:01,161 --> 00:56:05,428
peddlers to us if we do
proper deal with them

611
00:56:05,453 --> 00:56:08,420
But Inspector Vikram is
showing us nightmares

612
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:11,826
And his boss is behaving JL

613
00:56:11,851 --> 00:56:12,631
JL? What?

614
00:56:13,076 --> 00:56:14,709
I mean Jobless fellow

615
00:56:16,192 --> 00:56:20,608
Instead of talking to him
Let's ask George to come here

616
00:56:21,233 --> 00:56:22,506
Correct! Ask him

617
00:56:23,406 --> 00:56:25,014
I would like to speak with your boss

618
00:56:25,338 --> 00:56:27,294
No! It's not possible

619
00:56:28,943 --> 00:56:34,686
I have fun in talk
And gun in hand! Die or dial

620
00:56:35,198 --> 00:56:37,584
No
- Okay then die

621
00:56:39,486 --> 00:56:41,006
You dial or die

622
00:56:41,435 --> 00:56:43,920
Okay I'll dial

623
00:56:46,324 --> 00:56:48,905
Boss, the dealer wants to speak to you

624
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,312
Hello
- Mr George

625
00:56:54,996 --> 00:56:58,428
You didn't keep up your promise
We are unable to deal with your product

626
00:56:58,784 --> 00:57:01,084
I think you have to come down
to India immediately

627
00:57:01,683 --> 00:57:03,643
Okay, I will come on 28th

628
00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:04,631
Hold on

629
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:07,326
He is coming to India on 28th

630
00:57:07,803 --> 00:57:08,998
Is it okay for us?

631
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:10,311
Done

632
00:57:10,998 --> 00:57:11,998
Okay done

633
00:57:14,267 --> 00:57:15,099
Deal maker!

634
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:16,780
When he comes here

635
00:57:16,914 --> 00:57:21,561
We should reckon to whom all he is
betraying And teach him a lesson

636
00:57:21,785 --> 00:57:23,621
You took the Mid wicket

637
00:57:23,907 --> 00:57:25,022
Okay let's go

638
00:57:27,975 --> 00:57:34,022
Let him come on 28th! I'll take you all in
And pay you in bulk

639
00:57:41,333 --> 00:57:42,787
Bloody you!

640
00:57:51,131 --> 00:57:52,248
Bhavana!

641
00:57:55,236 --> 00:57:56,412
It was a dream!

642
00:57:58,201 --> 00:58:05,108
That's why they say
fall in love with a shorty than thief

643
00:58:06,014 --> 00:58:08,420
Shit! What a mess I'm in!

644
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,514
Sir you summoned me on an urgent matter?

645
00:58:12,539 --> 00:58:13,889
Come sit

646
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:18,725
I'm feeling quite emotional
So I called you to share my feelings

647
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:24,306
You call me to share feelings,
Look after carcasses and clear a mob

648
00:58:24,331 --> 00:58:26,069
You have never called me for a good thing

649
00:58:26,996 --> 00:58:30,881
Crow is invited to have offerings and
not pizzas Just shut up and sit

650
00:58:31,735 --> 00:58:34,403
You always shut the mouth of
this innocent fellow

651
00:58:34,692 --> 00:58:38,034
Don't worry! I've an item to
open your mouth

652
00:58:38,059 --> 00:58:42,498
He is not bothered about my sorrow

653
00:58:46,829 --> 00:58:49,116
Sir chips? For sides

654
00:58:50,797 --> 00:58:51,465
Catch it

655
00:58:53,979 --> 00:58:56,014
Now tell me sir
What is your problem?

656
00:58:56,278 --> 00:59:01,067
I realised that humans
find privacy to seek

657
00:59:01,091 --> 00:59:05,881
solace And lose
solace... he finds a lover

658
00:59:06,845 --> 00:59:08,076
Lover issue!

659
00:59:08,441 --> 00:59:11,352
Did she ditch you?
- No she shocked me

660
00:59:11,377 --> 00:59:12,920
Sir, tell me properly

661
00:59:14,089 --> 00:59:18,116
Do you know who is the boss of these drug
dealers? - That Social worker Johny

662
00:59:18,507 --> 00:59:22,423
Is it! He is a devil in disguise then!

663
00:59:23,303 --> 00:59:26,147
However, what it has to do with
your love case?

664
00:59:27,423 --> 00:59:31,030
Do you know who his right
hand is? My crush!

665
00:59:31,055 --> 00:59:32,983
Sir what are you saying?

666
00:59:33,118 --> 00:59:34,506
I'm unable to comprehend this

667
00:59:37,410 --> 00:59:41,235
Sir what is important to you now?
Duty or beauty?

668
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:42,717
Duty is important

669
00:59:43,382 --> 00:59:48,295
She will be beautiful till she gets old
But duty! It will be with me till I get old

670
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:53,998
See how I will beat them
to hell and punish them

671
00:59:54,209 --> 00:59:58,116
Correct sir! Make them
face a severe punishment

672
00:59:59,299 --> 01:00:02,608
We must not punish them
We must educate them

673
01:00:03,114 --> 01:00:07,342
You see how I will transform her with love
Love is almighty you know

674
01:00:07,877 --> 01:00:10,506
Yes sir love can do anything

675
01:00:11,583 --> 01:00:14,201
Love can do anything?! My foot

676
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:19,256
Duty will earn me bread
Love will earn me shit

677
01:00:20,414 --> 01:00:23,483
He is so Irony what can I do now

678
01:00:23,838 --> 01:00:26,754
You are tensed sir
Don't worry sir

679
01:00:27,372 --> 01:00:28,639
I'm with you

680
01:00:29,791 --> 01:00:30,451
You?

681
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:36,186
You are like an old 500 rupee note

682
01:00:37,313 --> 01:00:38,819
There is no use of keeping it

683
01:00:39,312 --> 01:00:42,959
Use my foot! Bloody fool

684
01:00:52,372 --> 01:00:53,872
Operation temple starts

685
01:00:56,767 --> 01:00:57,483
There you go

686
01:01:00,591 --> 01:01:03,034
She's dealing with beggars!

687
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:04,267
Let me see

688
01:01:05,794 --> 01:01:06,754
You are under arrest!

689
01:01:06,779 --> 01:01:08,694
Why sir? What did I do?

690
01:01:09,220 --> 01:01:10,678
What did he do sir?

691
01:01:10,703 --> 01:01:13,459
We can't let you take him
without any reason

692
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:17,936
You are one united team, right?
Let me put you all behind bars

693
01:01:18,191 --> 01:01:19,097
What are you going to do sir?

I'm fine! How are you?

697
01:01:30,995 --> 01:01:33,282
Oh the flower seller is involved too!

698
01:01:33,307 --> 01:01:35,795
Thanks aunty, see you
- God bless you

699
01:01:38,515 --> 01:01:39,522
What do you want?

700
01:01:41,307 --> 01:01:42,162
I want you

701
01:01:43,162 --> 01:01:43,538
Come

702
01:01:45,223 --> 01:01:45,723
Sit here

703
01:01:47,632 --> 01:01:49,920
Sir, Operation temple is success

704
01:01:50,089 --> 01:01:56,366
You compared me to old 500rs note!
Come I will show you what I've done

705
01:01:57,111 --> 01:02:00,326
Look over there sir
I've arrested the entire team of Johny

706
01:02:00,484 --> 01:02:06,623
They can't even sit straight
You claim them as his network?!

707
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:09,102
Am I really old 500rs note?

708
01:02:10,526 --> 01:02:15,116
Madam, do you have brown sugar?

709
01:02:15,695 --> 01:02:18,195
I've no sugar other than BP and Sugar

710
01:02:18,723 --> 01:02:20,819
Then what are you doing here?

711
01:02:21,502 --> 01:02:25,965
A rapist kind of a guy came to my stall

712
01:02:25,990 --> 01:02:29,282
I asked him what he wants
He said he wants me and brought me here

713
01:02:29,307 --> 01:02:32,658
Not only this old lady
He looked at us in a lustful way

714
01:02:32,683 --> 01:02:34,912
He said he will show us inside

715
01:02:34,937 --> 01:02:36,559
He is a big pervert

716
01:02:36,881 --> 01:02:39,530
He is roaming nearby
You be careful sir

717
01:02:39,555 --> 01:02:43,172
He is not even leaving us
Imagine you are a young man

718
01:02:43,197 --> 01:02:45,506
He will eat you out
Be careful sir

719
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:48,623
Fine, I will take care of it
You please get down

720
01:02:49,884 --> 01:02:51,340

721
01:02:51,364 --> 01:02:53,364

Excuse me

723
01:02:59,499 --> 01:03:02,583
I need to talk to you
Can I have your appointment?

724
01:03:02,608 --> 01:03:03,694
What do you want to talk?

725
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:06,657
Not here! Come let's go

726
01:03:10,391 --> 01:03:11,319
Let's go

727
01:03:13,928 --> 01:03:14,709
Hello

728
01:03:19,608 --> 01:03:20,998
Why do you have tears in your eyes?

729
01:03:23,068 --> 01:03:24,819
You get tears when you eat spicy

730
01:03:26,001 --> 01:03:27,819
You get tears when you are hurt

731
01:03:29,490 --> 01:03:34,143
But I shed tears looking
at people suffering

732
01:03:34,916 --> 01:03:37,854
Suffering?! I don't have any problem

733
01:03:38,257 --> 01:03:41,089
You may not express it
But I can sense it

734
01:03:41,416 --> 01:03:42,503
What do you know?

735
01:03:44,189 --> 01:03:47,698
You are good at heart
You have problems at home

736
01:03:48,581 --> 01:03:51,167
I've a poor family?!
- Yes exactly

737
01:03:51,590 --> 01:03:52,518
Not only that!

738
01:03:53,292 --> 01:03:57,495
Your mother has ulcer! Your dad has cancer
and your sister's marriage got cancelled

739
01:03:58,499 --> 01:04:03,104
On top of it, your brother is a nuts
And your sister is a freak

740
01:04:03,814 --> 01:04:08,410
Since you have to take care of them
You have taken the wrong path

741
01:04:08,435 --> 01:04:10,267
I've taken up a wrong path?!

742
01:04:11,282 --> 01:04:12,736
It's okay! Admit it

743
01:04:13,409 --> 01:04:15,081
To err is human

744
01:04:15,686 --> 01:04:17,230
To correct it is super-human

745
01:04:17,508 --> 01:04:18,792
Now you know Saroja?

746
01:04:18,817 --> 01:04:21,565
Hello my name is not Saroja

747
01:04:21,913 --> 01:04:24,932
See you couldn't withstand
when I addressed you with a wrong name

748
01:04:25,407 --> 01:04:28,675
But you have taken an evil path to earn

749
01:04:29,836 --> 01:04:31,104
How can I tolerate it?

750
01:04:32,223 --> 01:04:40,618
You still have time! I'm with you
You please change yourself! Transform

751
01:04:40,643 --> 01:04:45,074
You have gone mad!
There is no point in talking to you!

752
01:04:45,099 --> 01:04:46,534
Transform my foot!

753
01:04:48,601 --> 01:04:52,206
O dear! Change is the law

754
01:04:52,410 --> 01:04:55,487
Think about it
I will be waiting for you

755
01:04:57,813 --> 01:04:59,561
Good job Vikram!

756
01:04:59,970 --> 01:05:01,638
What's the outcome of yesterday's work?

757
01:05:01,663 --> 01:05:03,909
My situation is very serious

758
01:05:04,637 --> 01:05:08,618
I've given her time to change herself
Let's see what she is going to do

759
01:05:08,822 --> 01:05:12,620
You are feeling low! Let's take a leave
And have a sitting in Puja bar

760
01:05:12,830 --> 01:05:16,768
Bloody you!
I will make you even shorter

761
01:05:17,384 --> 01:05:18,729
Duty is important

762
01:05:19,698 --> 01:05:23,658
Our target Johny and George are like
heart in the drug racket

763
01:05:23,683 --> 01:05:28,315
Before attacking the heart
We must cut the nerves connected to it

764
01:05:29,285 --> 01:05:30,065
Let's go

765
01:05:48,476 --> 01:05:54,658
You have stroke down all my pawns
Leaving only the dog!?

766
01:05:54,823 --> 01:05:56,344
How is it sir?

767
01:06:03,104 --> 01:06:06,396
Sir, Vikram has seized all our goods
Which were in fish container

768
01:06:06,421 --> 01:06:07,430
Hey Vikram!

769
01:06:08,312 --> 01:06:11,282
It is not me sir
It's Vikram

770
01:06:11,307 --> 01:06:14,337
Hey come here! Take off your hand

771
01:06:15,746 --> 01:06:17,968
It's okay sir
-I'll take care

772
01:06:17,993 --> 01:06:20,665
It was me who thrashed you
I must take care of it

773
01:06:48,101 --> 01:06:50,471
You may go now
You please step forward

774
01:06:55,315 --> 01:06:58,534
Sir, Vikram has seized our pubs and bars

775
01:06:58,559 --> 01:06:59,683
Is it? Vikram!

776
01:06:59,683 --> 01:07:01,338
Sir, he is not Vikram

777
01:07:01,789 --> 01:07:02,830
Come here

778
01:07:03,209 --> 01:07:05,893
Shall I rub him?
- I hit him so I'll do it

779
01:07:06,338 --> 01:07:10,742
You please take extra glucose
Please don't tell anyone

780
01:07:10,767 --> 01:07:11,891
Please don't tell anyone

781
01:07:12,950 --> 01:07:15,034
Collect it from that idiot

782
01:07:37,625 --> 01:07:38,293
Give it

783
01:07:40,334 --> 01:07:42,846
May your green live long

784
01:07:48,834 --> 01:07:50,618
Did your ex-love text you?

785
01:07:50,643 --> 01:07:53,797
Not her! Vikram seized our rave parties too

786
01:07:53,822 --> 01:07:55,041
Vikram

787
01:07:55,823 --> 01:07:59,572
Oh sorry! Keep doing it

788
01:08:00,866 --> 01:08:07,360
You used to rub wherever they got hit!
Why did you stop now!? Rub it! Kiss it

789
01:08:07,385 --> 01:08:12,221
Idiot! He called me
to water one plant not to his base

790
01:08:12,510 --> 01:08:18,018
Do one thing! Rub him with your right hand
And give him a kiss, you rascal

791
01:08:19,808 --> 01:08:22,307
And did madam call you yesterday?

792
01:08:23,415 --> 01:08:26,205
No! Even I'm worried about it

793
01:08:26,901 --> 01:08:30,277
She worries more about her deals than me

794
01:08:30,302 --> 01:08:34,416
No sir! I guarantee you
She will leave her deal and come to you

795
01:08:34,822 --> 01:08:35,716
How can you say it?

796
01:08:35,741 --> 01:08:39,568
When girls can leave their father for love
Then will she not leave her deals?

797
01:08:39,593 --> 01:08:43,862
So, you think she will come for me?
Fine, you can have my tea

798
01:08:44,393 --> 01:08:45,061
Thank you sir

799
01:08:50,312 --> 01:08:52,728
Sir, here she comes

800
01:08:54,924 --> 01:09:01,242
She will come to me in slow-motion
and hug me

801
01:09:01,267 --> 01:09:02,323
Yes sir

802
01:09:04,492 --> 01:09:05,885
Here she comes

803
01:09:06,797 --> 01:09:07,377
Sir
- Is she here?

804
01:09:07,402 --> 01:09:10,604
Sir, she came and went in fast-motion

805
01:09:11,122 --> 01:09:14,870
Bloody idiot! You kindled
my desires for no use

806
01:09:24,733 --> 01:09:28,557
What is this!? My girl purchased
some wired things

807
01:09:28,999 --> 01:09:39,074
sir! She purchased wedding materials and
went into consult a wedding date

808
01:09:39,099 --> 01:09:42,541
You will get a call in few minutes
You just have to go and tie knots to her

809
01:09:43,585 --> 01:09:45,377
See you are getting the call now

810
01:09:46,010 --> 01:09:47,135
Hello, shall I tie knots?

811
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:51,118
Pay your loan first! I'm calling from the
bank I'm speaking to Akram, right?

812
01:09:51,143 --> 01:09:55,104
This is not Akram! I'm Vikram
Cut the call

813
01:10:02,513 --> 01:10:03,868
You said it is for my marriage

814
01:10:07,182 --> 01:10:11,300
Take the cash! Quit rowdyism and
Start a new life in Bengaluru

815
01:10:11,325 --> 01:10:13,177
Thank you sister
- Mention not

816
01:10:13,202 --> 01:10:14,658
Why don't you quit this mafia?

817
01:10:15,315 --> 01:10:18,913
I want to deal one last time
And settle down in my life

818
01:10:18,938 --> 01:10:21,068
See, my preaching has worked

819
01:10:21,093 --> 01:10:22,177
All the best to both of you

820
01:10:22,943 --> 01:10:23,846

See, he has people to open the door

832

01:11:57,209 --> 01:11:59,950
You be cool sir

834
01:11:59,975 --> 01:12:06,026
You idiot! He is an anaconda eater
You are a rice eater

01:12:06,201 --> 01:12:11,113
If you get caught in his hands
He will eat the hell out of you

836
01:12:11,138 --> 01:12:13,330
You be away from him
I will handle this

837
01:12:18,415 --> 01:12:22,338
My girl's relatives have come
But she hasn't come yet

838
01:12:25,328 --> 01:12:26,450
She must have changed her mind!

839
01:12:26,475 --> 01:12:28,127
Hi Johny
- Hi George

840
01:12:28,152 --> 01:12:30,574
I tried to call
Your mobile was switched off

841
01:12:30,599 --> 01:12:32,665
Yeah George! Mobile no charge

842
01:12:32,690 --> 01:12:34,059
You said you have a problem

843
01:12:34,084 --> 01:12:35,836
Oh! More more problem here

844
01:12:36,099 --> 01:12:38,490
You take all your packets
And return my cash

845
01:12:38,515 --> 01:12:40,688
Cash! It is highly impossible

846
01:12:40,713 --> 01:12:42,789
Don't exam my patience

847
01:12:42,814 --> 01:12:46,217
Or I will kill you and put your body
In some lake! Mind it

848
01:12:46,242 --> 01:12:47,385
No cash!

849
01:12:47,410 --> 01:12:54,450
Hey you bloody idiot If I go crazy!
I will curse you in local language

850
01:12:54,630 --> 01:12:57,366
Why don't you simply return my money
and stop shouting

851
01:12:57,461 --> 01:12:58,112
What?

852
01:12:58,281 --> 01:13:02,830
Why are you tearing your back I say?
Give cash... Deal close

853
01:13:03,005 --> 01:13:03,651
Never

854
01:13:03,676 --> 01:13:05,713
You say never, you loafer

855
01:13:07,389 --> 01:13:13,823
Het take this doberman to our godown
I will beat him to hell

856
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:17,807
You killed my man!
How was my shot?!

857
01:13:20,217 --> 01:13:21,916
They are killing each other!

858
01:13:22,776 --> 01:13:24,409
We need them alive to get the information

859
01:13:25,115 --> 01:13:27,615
I must attack before they kill each other

860
01:13:29,297 --> 01:13:30,541
Who shot him?

861
01:13:32,414 --> 01:13:34,994
I swear! It wasn't me

862
01:13:51,727 --> 01:13:52,830
Super!

863
01:13:54,258 --> 01:13:55,916
Here comes my partner!

864
01:13:56,208 --> 01:14:04,916
Usually hero comes to save But here
heroin has come to save this villain

865
01:14:05,057 --> 01:14:07,377
Mona! Great job!

866
01:14:07,402 --> 01:14:10,737
Bloody fool! Stop staring
Go catch them all

867
01:14:11,978 --> 01:14:18,643
I dreamt a lot about you just now
You are spoiling everything

868
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:23,182
Don't shoot! Listen to me
- Leave me Vikram

869
01:14:23,207 --> 01:14:25,948
You don't understand!
I don't have time for all this shit

870
01:14:25,973 --> 01:14:27,611
You want to shoot him, right?

871
01:14:27,636 --> 01:14:31,151
You see, I will shoot him up
You please go from here

872
01:14:32,234 --> 01:14:34,190
Don't come in my way Vikram

873
01:14:36,397 --> 01:14:37,981
Vikram, why don't you understand

874
01:14:39,085 --> 01:14:41,596
Vikram, why don't you understand

875
01:14:42,163 --> 01:14:44,707
Just go to hell
- I will not let you shoot

876
01:14:56,297 --> 01:15:00,893
I came to give you a life
But you took my life

877
01:15:36,227 --> 01:15:41,559
Love is like an infant!
It will piss on you when you embrace it

878
01:15:41,944 --> 01:15:46,515
You can't withstand or drop it
Why do you need this love?

879
01:15:46,709 --> 01:15:51,045
My heart has no space for love
but vengeance

880
01:15:51,070 --> 01:15:52,515
Oh the stitch

881
01:15:54,914 --> 01:15:56,406
He's an old man

882
01:15:56,553 --> 01:15:58,195
Let's give him one fruit

883
01:15:58,297 --> 01:16:00,000
Mister, would you like to
have a sweet lime?

884
01:16:00,025 --> 01:16:03,672
How dare you say shut up to me?!

885
01:16:03,697 --> 01:16:09,531
Did I not tell you to enquire
When they are going to discharge me?

886
01:16:10,188 --> 01:16:11,812
Surgeon named Dhruva is coming

887
01:16:11,837 --> 01:16:17,390
What!? Dhruva Sarja is coming?

888
01:16:18,183 --> 01:16:20,328
Not Sarja, surgeon

889
01:16:20,353 --> 01:16:26,023
Oh Srujan from Maja talkies!
Let him come! I know him very well

890
01:16:26,048 --> 01:16:29,203
Srujan is coming

891
01:16:29,516 --> 01:16:30,848
You first go to an ENT

892
01:16:31,797 --> 01:16:35,500
You want me to my wife?
Who wants to go her?!

893
01:16:35,525 --> 01:16:37,906
Are you planning to go to her?

894
01:16:38,022 --> 01:16:39,281
Get lost

895
01:16:39,306 --> 01:16:42,762
I pitied him but see how he cursed me

896
01:16:42,787 --> 01:16:44,579
Bloody idiot

897
01:16:44,966 --> 01:16:47,703
Sir, discharge summary is ready

898
01:16:48,386 --> 01:16:55,218
Okay sister! If you don't mind
Can I call you 'Madam' instead of 'Sister'?

899
01:16:55,683 --> 01:16:56,718
Thank you

900
01:16:57,311 --> 01:16:58,656
Place my pillow first

901
01:17:00,989 --> 01:17:02,007
I will be back

902
01:17:09,203 --> 01:17:09,727
Hi

903
01:17:11,793 --> 01:17:14,406
Hey why are you here?
Doctor

904
01:17:14,518 --> 01:17:17,890
She must be keeping a gun in the bouquet
Please somebody stop her

905
01:17:18,302 --> 01:17:21,734
Vikram, I came here to see you

906
01:17:21,759 --> 01:17:24,000
You came here to see if I'm alive or not?

907
01:17:24,025 --> 01:17:25,289
What are you doing?

908
01:17:25,314 --> 01:17:27,254
What is wrong with you?
Calm down

909
01:17:27,279 --> 01:17:30,000
Uncle, you have come on right time
She's a criminal! Arrest her

910
01:17:30,025 --> 01:17:31,880
Who do you think she is?

911
01:17:31,905 --> 01:17:34,914
She's not a freedom fighter
She is drug peddler Moni

912
01:17:34,955 --> 01:17:36,562
No, she is Pinky

913
01:17:36,587 --> 01:17:39,165
Pinky or Monkey
Everyone is equal before the law

914
01:17:39,190 --> 01:17:42,148
She's my daughter Bhavana
Your childhood friend

915
01:17:42,173 --> 01:17:44,289
You used to call her Pinky

916
01:17:44,314 --> 01:17:49,726
Your daughter Bhavana! Mostly your baby
got replaced in the hospital

917
01:17:49,889 --> 01:17:54,507
So sad! Your daughter must be
selling vegetables in some market

918
01:17:54,596 --> 01:17:58,804
She sells marijuana
Arrest her and find your real daughter

919
01:17:59,302 --> 01:18:01,914
Listen, to me properly
She is my daughter

920
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:04,624
Not only that!
She's an undercover police officer

921
01:18:05,081 --> 01:18:07,422
You were sent to Manipal to back her up

922
01:18:07,447 --> 01:18:07,991
Back up!

923
01:18:08,623 --> 01:18:11,101
All these things happened
according to my plan

924
01:18:11,126 --> 01:18:12,070
Sorry Vikram

925
01:18:12,668 --> 01:18:15,937
I couldn't tell you
I belong to your department

926
01:18:16,805 --> 01:18:19,859
You tried to kill me being
my fellow officer!

927
01:18:19,884 --> 01:18:24,132
No you have mistaken me
I didn't shoot you on purpose

928
01:18:24,157 --> 01:18:26,711
I was aiming them
But you came in between

929
01:18:32,002 --> 01:18:34,211
Oh she shot at me!

930
01:18:34,236 --> 01:18:35,890
Your game ends today

931
01:18:35,915 --> 01:18:39,047
I told you I'm skeptical about her
What did you tell me?

932
01:18:39,072 --> 01:18:40,312
What did I tell you?

933
01:18:41,668 --> 01:18:44,734
I said she looks like 'Jackie'
movie's Bhavana

934
01:18:44,759 --> 01:18:46,304
Now get beaten up

935
01:18:46,702 --> 01:18:47,804
I'm so sorry

936
01:18:49,529 --> 01:18:53,578
We are childhood friends, right?
Won't you forgive me?

937
01:18:53,603 --> 01:18:54,836
Hey please

938
01:18:56,013 --> 01:18:57,500
Vicky please

939
01:18:57,525 --> 01:19:00,007
He is asleep
Don't disturb him

940
01:19:00,032 --> 01:19:02,320
Visiting time is over
You may go now

941
01:19:02,781 --> 01:19:03,599
Vicky

942
01:19:03,721 --> 01:19:08,851
Bhavana, you can talk to him
when his mood gets back to normal

943
01:19:18,218 --> 01:19:18,777
Sir

944
01:19:19,619 --> 01:19:20,859
Sir
- Is she gone?

945
01:19:21,277 --> 01:19:23,766
Your childhood friend?
She went off

946
01:19:25,022 --> 01:19:26,093
How did you come to know?

947
01:19:26,411 --> 01:19:28,656
I over heard it
Go ahead

948
01:19:29,078 --> 01:19:31,492
You will get discharged in half an hour
I will pack up the things

949
01:19:47,214 --> 01:19:49,406
Mom, what are you worried about?

950
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:52,365
I told you the other
day to send Vikram

951
01:19:52,389 --> 01:19:55,074
back to home But
you don't listen to me

952
01:19:55,684 --> 01:20:00,268
We had to handle the case secretly
So I asked her not to tell anyone

953
01:20:00,297 --> 01:20:01,726
You always make an excuse

954
01:20:02,424 --> 01:20:06,742
Now, Vikram hates her
What to do now?

955
01:20:09,424 --> 01:20:15,195
Mom, stop worrying about Vikram
I'll make compromise within two days

956
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:17,789
No way! No compromise

957
01:20:18,214 --> 01:20:21,695
From tomorrow you will see
How I will shock her

958
01:20:22,296 --> 01:20:26,474
Anyhow, would you like to
have grilled chicken?

959
01:20:26,499 --> 01:20:30,500
I would like to but no thanks
I've gas trouble

960
01:20:30,525 --> 01:20:31,961
My heart is burning like a furnace

961
01:20:31,986 --> 01:20:33,828
Why worry about it?

962
01:20:34,036 --> 01:20:36,601
There is Gas-o-fast made of cumin

963
01:20:36,858 --> 01:20:39,450
Drink it with water
Your gas problem will get solved

964
01:20:39,475 --> 01:20:41,267
Is it? I will try now

965
01:20:57,710 --> 01:21:02,502
What you said is true! After taking
Gas-O-fast My gas got vanished

966
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:06,030
Take it

967
01:21:10,094 --> 01:21:11,929
You gave me everything!
What about you?

968
01:21:12,208 --> 01:21:14,218
You go ahead
I want you to be happy

969
01:21:14,243 --> 01:21:15,406
Thank you sir

970
01:21:15,975 --> 01:21:19,515
They said this chicken died
due to chicken flu

971
01:21:19,697 --> 01:21:21,804
I didn't want to waste it
So I served it to you

972
01:21:22,590 --> 01:21:23,726
I've fresh chicken for me

973
01:21:25,643 --> 01:21:26,945
Just kidding

974
01:21:29,335 --> 01:21:31,312
You need strength to fight criminals

975
01:21:31,587 --> 01:21:33,825
Sir, you don't know
about my strength I sit

976
01:21:33,849 --> 01:21:36,034
in Kanti bar and do
Golibar when I stand

977
01:21:36,059 --> 01:21:38,148
I'm your disciple
How can I fail?

978
01:21:38,173 --> 01:21:39,629
Enough praising! Dig it

979
01:21:39,654 --> 01:21:41,609
We need to join to duty from tomorrow

980
01:21:47,417 --> 01:21:51,410
See, my staff is waiting to welcome me

981
01:21:51,435 --> 01:21:52,343
You are great

982
01:21:53,031 --> 01:21:55,875
Why are you doing this?
I just performed my duty

983
01:21:55,900 --> 01:21:58,414
This is not for you sir
This is for our new officer

984
01:21:59,410 --> 01:22:02,609
I don't like such grand welcome
Anyhow, you carry on

985
01:22:08,722 --> 01:22:11,375
Sir, she got posted to our station!

986
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:12,864
So be it!

987
01:22:12,889 --> 01:22:17,601
The situation will get worsen soon
Let her come. She had it

988
01:22:19,803 --> 01:22:23,047
May be the second Kohinoor
diamond will be her

989
01:22:23,072 --> 01:22:26,398
What is this sir? She is enjoying
the reap of your efforts

990
01:22:26,423 --> 01:22:27,523
So be it!

991
01:22:27,929 --> 01:22:33,754
She looks like a zombie on a ramp
This is a cheap gimmick

992
01:22:33,779 --> 01:22:37,403
Her fans have a created a Facebook page
for her achievement

993
01:22:37,591 --> 01:22:42,906
You should create a page in history
That is called achievement

994
01:22:43,087 --> 01:22:44,414
My level is different

995
01:22:44,439 --> 01:22:48,534
That's why you are called Second Kohinoor
diamond That's why I follow you

996
01:22:48,559 --> 01:22:50,391
Sir, madam has summoned you
- Tell her I'm busy

997
01:22:50,391 --> 01:22:51,765
She summoned you urgently

998
01:22:53,143 --> 01:22:54,257
Curb your belly

999
01:22:58,101 --> 01:22:58,622
Yes

1000
01:22:59,901 --> 01:23:01,085
Come Vicky, have a seat

1001
01:23:01,110 --> 01:23:03,297
Not Vicky, Vikram

1002
01:23:03,388 --> 01:23:04,158
How are you?

1003
01:23:04,237 --> 01:23:05,351
I'm dashing

1004
01:23:05,376 --> 01:23:07,088
Why did you report to duty so early?

1005
01:23:07,113 --> 01:23:08,414
Why are you bothered?

1006
01:23:08,592 --> 01:23:12,179
I mean you should have taken
Few more days of leave

1007
01:23:12,204 --> 01:23:12,975
No I won't

1008
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,117
You should have taken some rest

1009
01:23:14,142 --> 01:23:15,023
No I will not take

1010
01:23:16,592 --> 01:23:18,297
You are still angry on me?

1011
01:23:18,322 --> 01:23:20,172
No! Not so soon

1012
01:23:20,456 --> 01:23:21,187
So what?

1013
01:23:21,267 --> 01:23:27,312
Please Vikram, try to understand
You know how bad I felt

1014
01:23:38,838 --> 01:23:45,007
You should have acted in the movie Tagaru
instead of Bhavana. Wow! What an acting!

1015
01:23:45,032 --> 01:23:47,609
I promise Vikram I'm not acting

1016
01:23:47,634 --> 01:23:50,493
What do you and your
father think about me?

1017
01:23:50,517 --> 01:23:53,375
An inspector or a
generator to give back up?

1018
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:54,898
At least you should have told me the truth

1019
01:23:55,601 --> 01:23:57,658
I came to you so many times

1020
01:23:57,683 --> 01:24:01,435
But you didn't allow me to talk
In the name of love

1021
01:24:02,156 --> 01:24:04,293
Instead of proposing
with roses You

1022
01:24:04,317 --> 01:24:07,023
proposed me by
annoying, which I liked too

1023
01:24:07,213 --> 01:24:10,781
Though I was in love
I pretend like I didn't love you

1024
01:24:11,109 --> 01:24:15,312
Even I lied you that I love you

1025
01:24:15,402 --> 01:24:17,515
What? You lied?

1026
01:24:18,825 --> 01:24:21,617
Look into my eyes and tell me
you don't love this Pinky

1027
01:24:22,123 --> 01:24:26,287
There can be fire and not Pinky in Vikram's
eyes I'm not in love with you

1028
01:24:26,312 --> 01:24:28,534
But I do
- I don't accept you

1029
01:24:28,559 --> 01:24:29,882
I will make you accept

1030
01:24:31,505 --> 01:24:32,712
Hey this is my dialogue

1031
01:24:32,857 --> 01:24:34,143
You stole my words

1032
01:24:34,168 --> 01:24:35,574
You stole my heart

1033
01:24:35,599 --> 01:24:37,311
I don't want your kind of a girl

1034
01:24:37,311 --> 01:24:38,851
I want your kind of a boy

1035
01:24:39,917 --> 01:24:43,017
Snake and mangoose can only fight

1036
01:24:43,042 --> 01:24:45,337
You change your mind every now and then
Have you gone mad?

1037
01:24:45,511 --> 01:24:48,173
You are mad! Your dad and
your entire family is mad

1038
01:24:48,198 --> 01:24:50,517
I will give you one if you curse my dad

1039
01:24:50,625 --> 01:24:52,603
Show some respect! I'm a police officer

1040
01:24:53,601 --> 01:24:55,611
As if I'm a watchman!

1041
01:24:56,517 --> 01:24:57,477
Hey get lost

1042
01:24:58,114 --> 01:25:00,614
You said get lost!

1043
01:25:01,059 --> 01:25:01,525
Yeah

1044
01:25:02,603 --> 01:25:03,059
Alright!

1045
01:25:04,033 --> 01:25:04,781
But

1046
01:25:05,638 --> 01:25:07,142
One last word before leaving

1047
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:08,001
What?

1048
01:25:08,326 --> 01:25:09,032
Come close

1049
01:25:10,673 --> 01:25:11,605
Come closer

1050
01:25:13,212 --> 01:25:14,227
Get lost

1051
01:25:14,694 --> 01:25:16,212
How dare you say get lost to me?

1052
01:25:16,237 --> 01:25:22,673
Well you dared to say it to me
Won't I counter-attack?

1053
01:25:22,847 --> 01:25:25,501
I counter in words
And encounter in the field

1054
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:27,798
Get lost

1055
01:25:29,431 --> 01:25:30,351
I'm gonna kill you

1056
01:25:31,263 --> 01:25:35,384
Hey Basava, what they two are discussing
on the first day of the duty?

1057
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:40,704
Probably they are planning their
honeymoon destination

1058
01:25:40,866 --> 01:25:44,321
Honeymoon? They might go to Kulu-Manali

1059
01:25:44,402 --> 01:25:51,134
Why Manali, when you can
do the same at home?

1060
01:25:51,209 --> 01:25:52,587
Well, that's true

1061
01:25:52,612 --> 01:25:56,337
Nandanath Gupta! Always
interested in rumours

1062
01:25:56,362 --> 01:25:58,298
Basava, let's go

1063
01:25:58,711 --> 01:26:05,950
We need to go to the boy's hospital
Girls are forcing boys to love them

1064
01:26:05,975 --> 01:26:09,611
This Second Kohinoor diamond can't tolerate
When boy's are in trouble

1065
01:26:10,492 --> 01:26:11,157
Let's go

1066
01:26:11,182 --> 01:26:13,798
Sir, let others come to know as well
Wear it and come

1067
01:29:27,597 --> 01:29:29,331
Okay I will warn both of them

1068
01:29:32,003 --> 01:29:33,909
Sir, you summoned us

1069
01:29:34,219 --> 01:29:37,242
I never expected
such a bad behaviour from you two

1070
01:29:37,267 --> 01:29:39,206
What did I do uncle, sir?

1071
01:29:39,787 --> 01:29:41,589
Why you two are fighting in the department?

1072
01:29:42,065 --> 01:29:45,612
People complaint on criminals
But here they are complaining on police

1073
01:29:46,099 --> 01:29:46,925
I'm ashamed

1074
01:29:48,095 --> 01:29:51,620
Tell him not to envy
because I earned credit in Johny's case

1075
01:29:54,605 --> 01:29:59,321
How can Sun envy a candle?
Tell her not to live in hallucinations

1076
01:29:59,407 --> 01:29:59,987
What?

1077
01:30:00,012 --> 01:30:01,672
Don't touch me
- Don't you let me

1078
01:30:01,697 --> 01:30:02,354
Stop it

1079
01:30:02,922 --> 01:30:05,596
I can see how you might
be quarrelling outside

1080
01:30:05,719 --> 01:30:09,135
If you repeat it I will take
a serious action against you two

1081
01:30:09,596 --> 01:30:10,512
Sorry sir
- Sorry sir

1082
01:30:10,537 --> 01:30:11,901
Get out! Out

1083
01:30:13,618 --> 01:30:14,432
Nonsense

1084
01:30:18,211 --> 01:30:20,550
Are you happy now?

1085
01:30:22,003 --> 01:30:27,846
I didn't know bad time comes in a uniform

1086
01:30:29,599 --> 01:30:35,807
Even I knew female ghosts come in white
sarees But didn't know she comes in uniform

1087
01:30:35,909 --> 01:30:40,909
Keep acting like this I'll get you
transformed to a godforsaken place

1088
01:30:43,532 --> 01:30:46,534
I will not forgive you if you salute me now
- Not to you. Come this way

1089
01:30:46,923 --> 01:30:48,547
What you guys are discussing?

1090
01:30:48,921 --> 01:30:51,366
Nothing sir.. Just regarding the case

1091
01:30:51,391 --> 01:30:52,917
Okay carry on

1092
01:30:54,386 --> 01:30:56,604
Couldn't you see him coming?
- I don't have eyes on my back

1093
01:30:57,599 --> 01:30:58,935
May I come in sir?
- Yes come in

1094
01:31:03,310 --> 01:31:05,026
Take your seat
- Thank you sir

1095
01:31:06,997 --> 01:31:08,378
Sir you look tensed

1096
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:11,892
Regarding Vikram-Bhavana fight
That's there

1097
01:31:12,276 --> 01:31:16,010
Is there any progress in
Aradhya's murder case?

1098
01:31:16,410 --> 01:31:20,078
No sir! I've enquired 476 suspects till now

1099
01:31:20,586 --> 01:31:25,331
I've investigated mobiles and CCTV footages
I've not found a single clue

1100
01:31:28,357 --> 01:31:31,950
Was there any extra-material affair
Or family disputes?

1101
01:31:31,975 --> 01:31:35,339
We enquired that too
No disputes no affairs

1102
01:31:35,379 --> 01:31:37,919
He is a clean man
Absolutely no haters

1103
01:31:38,425 --> 01:31:41,831
Then who killed him?
Someone has to be there behind the murder

1104
01:31:43,308 --> 01:31:44,600
Even I'm unable to crack it

1105
01:31:45,587 --> 01:31:48,792
Sir as you know
I used to solve cases within 48 hours

1106
01:31:49,531 --> 01:31:52,229
But for the first time
I've literally failed

1107
01:31:53,862 --> 01:31:58,198
In that case, we will have to file
C report and close the case

1108
01:31:59,101 --> 01:32:00,456
I'm upset for the same

1109
01:32:01,387 --> 01:32:02,807
That's why I've taken up a decision

1110
01:32:04,305 --> 01:32:08,300
I don't want to take my salary
By eye-washing. Sir better I quit

1111
01:32:09,625 --> 01:32:12,561
The department needs an efficient
officer like you

1112
01:32:12,586 --> 01:32:14,878
Sir it's not like that
- You need not explain

1113
01:32:14,903 --> 01:32:17,682
PM visiting the city next week
Go look after the security

1114
01:32:18,127 --> 01:32:19,698
But sir please
- You can go now

1115
01:32:20,418 --> 01:32:21,010
Okay sir

1116
01:32:35,076 --> 01:32:37,295
Yes Commissioner
- Hello sir

1117
01:32:37,320 --> 01:32:39,034
I heard you are closing Aradhya's case

1118
01:32:39,059 --> 01:32:39,815
Sir that is

1119
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:43,050
No ifs and buts
This is election time

1120
01:32:43,075 --> 01:32:47,807
What if the public and media comes to know
I want you to continue to the investigation

1121
01:32:49,610 --> 01:32:50,604
What happened?

1122
01:32:50,839 --> 01:32:53,826
Aradhya's case is not fetching any clue

1123
01:32:53,851 --> 01:32:55,599
These two are fighting with each other

1124
01:32:56,104 --> 01:32:58,800
Now I'm in deep trouble

1125
01:32:59,088 --> 01:33:00,815
I don't know how to handle this

1126
01:33:00,998 --> 01:33:04,910
Why are you worried?
Tie them up together

1127
01:33:05,098 --> 01:33:06,722
Then they will walk on a same path

1128
01:33:06,841 --> 01:33:09,089
What? Tie them up?

1129
01:33:28,721 --> 01:33:29,745
Hi boss

1130
01:33:31,892 --> 01:33:34,815
Boss he is Imtiaz
He is a Ghoda supplier

1131
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:35,706
Hello sir

1132
01:33:36,214 --> 01:33:37,081
Show him the product

1133
01:33:41,597 --> 01:33:42,675
It's a new model

1134
01:33:43,557 --> 01:33:45,307
Shall I show you how to load the magazine?

1135
01:33:49,995 --> 01:33:54,534
When I came to know about the magazine
You hadn't known fairy tale magazine

1136
01:33:56,202 --> 01:33:57,628
Don't try to teach me

1137
01:33:57,996 --> 01:33:58,910
Sorry sir

1138
01:33:58,935 --> 01:34:02,118
What say? Is this original or air gun?

1139
01:34:02,143 --> 01:34:05,542
Sir, this is original

1140
01:34:05,820 --> 01:34:06,320
Boss

1141
01:34:12,081 --> 01:34:13,042
Let's try

1142
01:34:24,987 --> 01:34:25,559
Yes

1143
01:34:26,604 --> 01:34:27,620
It is original

1144
01:34:31,230 --> 01:34:33,698
Are you thinking why I shot him?

1145
01:34:35,217 --> 01:34:37,643
He was supplying to my competitor too

1146
01:34:39,006 --> 01:34:41,010
I didn't like it

1147
01:34:42,942 --> 01:34:49,909
Doesn't matter how huge is the throne
Only one king should sit on it

1148
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:52,354
Got it?
- Yes sir

1149
01:34:54,363 --> 01:34:57,721
Make him supply to North-Indian
weapon dealers

1150
01:34:59,002 --> 01:35:01,823
I never tried North-India before

1151
01:35:02,492 --> 01:35:05,206
It is quite risky
- Risk?

1152
01:35:06,180 --> 01:35:08,081
You can't climb to the top
Without any risk

1153
01:35:08,602 --> 01:35:12,425
Do you know the shape of the world?

1154
01:35:13,375 --> 01:35:14,612
It is round in shape

1155
01:35:18,009 --> 01:35:23,409
That's taught by primary school teachers
Get updated

1156
01:35:28,332 --> 01:35:29,460
Rectangle

1157
01:35:30,411 --> 01:35:35,557
When we are born father makes cradle for us
When we die our son makes a grave for us

1158
01:35:36,805 --> 01:35:39,635
Weaving dreams is not life

1159
01:35:40,396 --> 01:35:46,772
We are not born just to build dream
We are born to build empires

1160
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:48,987
Got it?

1161
01:35:49,604 --> 01:35:50,229
Yes sir

1162
01:35:50,807 --> 01:35:51,475
Boss

1163
01:35:53,341 --> 01:35:55,729
Make him start supplying from today onwards

1164
01:36:04,190 --> 01:36:04,706
Hello

1165
01:36:05,830 --> 01:36:07,604
Gabriel my friend

1166
01:36:13,931 --> 01:36:16,679
We will not close this case at any cost

1167
01:36:16,999 --> 01:36:23,425
Due to other pressures we are hand overing
the case from Pratap to Bhavana and Vikram

1168
01:36:24,707 --> 01:36:29,651
Doesn't matter who handles it
The murdered will not come to be a witness

1169
01:38:08,721 --> 01:38:11,228
You have been made
in-charge of the Aradhya's

1170
01:38:11,252 --> 01:38:13,416
case I want you to
solve it as a team

1171
01:38:13,614 --> 01:38:18,135
Sir, with her?
I can not do it sir

1172
01:38:18,391 --> 01:38:23,366
I can do some laymen work than
working with her. I'm sorry

1173
01:38:23,391 --> 01:38:27,683
I can be a street vendor
But I can not work with him

1174
01:38:27,683 --> 01:38:29,767
Will you both stop this?
It is my order

1175
01:38:30,385 --> 01:38:34,712
Both of you study the case
I need fast results It's an order

1176
01:38:34,737 --> 01:38:35,985
Yes sir
- Okay sir

1177
01:38:36,604 --> 01:38:38,682
Give me the file
I need to study it

1178
01:38:39,326 --> 01:38:42,455
I'm not selling it to the crap
I need to study it too

1179
01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:47,611
You have time only to drink at home
You have no time to study the case

1180
01:38:47,989 --> 01:38:51,424
You have no seriousness who
watch serials at home

1181
01:38:51,864 --> 01:38:53,979
Give that to me

1182
01:38:55,651 --> 01:38:56,580
Keep it

1183
01:38:57,461 --> 01:39:00,197
I can study in two seconds
which you can study in two days

1184
01:39:00,902 --> 01:39:02,565
You are 2G I'm 5G

1185
01:39:04,883 --> 01:39:05,675
Very fast

1186
01:39:07,603 --> 01:39:09,729
You are fit for self-praising

1187
01:39:10,503 --> 01:39:12,919
I will shoot you
- Please no sir

1188
01:39:12,944 --> 01:39:14,518
I'm respecting his words and sparing you

1189
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:15,971
God save me from becoming a
ghost movie like prey

1190
01:41:09,901 --> 01:41:13,455
May be the ghost wants
to catch lonely bachelor

1191
01:41:13,479 --> 01:41:17,033
like me If I knew I would
have got married at 18

1192
01:41:17,396 --> 01:41:18,815
My bloody fate!

1193
01:41:27,667 --> 01:41:34,387
Don't be afraid! Our boss is Lord Anjaneya
He is the slayer of demons

1194
01:41:34,412 --> 01:41:37,932
Devotee of Lord Anjaneya should be fearless

1195
01:41:55,166 --> 01:41:56,885
Oh ghost!

1196
01:41:56,910 --> 01:42:01,533
Look at him madam
He is screaming like this since yesterday

1197
01:42:02,002 --> 01:42:03,260
Sir what happened?

1198
01:42:03,285 --> 01:42:08,151
Basava! There is one child ghost in my home

1199
01:42:08,176 --> 01:42:11,307
But I've not seen any ghost here

1200
01:42:11,332 --> 01:42:12,544
There is no ghost here

1201
01:42:13,922 --> 01:42:15,502
Were you watching horror movies?

1202
01:42:15,696 --> 01:42:19,160
Sir there is no such
thing called ghosts

1203
01:42:19,184 --> 01:42:23,182
Look, he was drunk and
watched horror movies

1204
01:42:23,207 --> 01:42:25,244
He was just shouting in the dark

1205
01:42:25,886 --> 01:42:28,244
Why do you watch horror movies
when you have no guts?

1206
01:42:28,276 --> 01:42:33,158
Don't you dare speak about my guts
I'm a devotee of Lord Anjaneya

1207
01:42:33,183 --> 01:42:37,432
Ghosts run away when he
hits them with his mace

1208
01:42:37,681 --> 01:42:39,916
Why would I get scared
by watching a ghost in Tv?

1209
01:42:39,941 --> 01:42:44,197
They look ghost with make-up
But you look ghost without any make-up

1210
01:42:44,222 --> 01:42:47,354
I don't get scared by you
- Do I look like a ghost?

1211
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:51,200
All other gods came to
know how creative Lord

1212
01:42:51,224 --> 01:42:54,408
Brahma is When he created
this Bhavana, you know?

1213
01:42:56,101 --> 01:43:01,330
She's self-praising in the middle of the
night! Is there nobody to stop her?

1214
01:43:01,355 --> 01:43:06,104
I didn't come here to see your cute face!
I came here because he called me

1215
01:43:06,591 --> 01:43:10,729
Thanks for your visit
You may go now

1216
01:43:10,754 --> 01:43:12,130
Go drop her home

1217
01:43:13,361 --> 01:43:14,252
I can go on my own

1218
01:43:17,876 --> 01:43:24,932
There is one black-magician in a PG nearby
I suggest you to share room with him

1219
01:43:25,612 --> 01:43:31,471
This alpha panther doesn't need protection
You may go now

1220
01:43:31,496 --> 01:43:34,580
Sir, please listen to me
Okay no sir

1221
01:43:40,894 --> 01:43:45,307
Slippers keep ghosts away!
Where are you child ghost

1222
01:43:47,892 --> 01:43:52,026
Basava get me a cup of coffee
I'm having a sever headache

1223
01:43:52,327 --> 01:43:56,119
Don't you want energised lime?

1224
01:43:57,073 --> 01:44:01,822
Can't she be happy without annoying me?
Hey get me Aravind Aradhya's case file

1225
01:44:02,524 --> 01:44:04,705
Tell him the case file is on the table

1226
01:44:06,018 --> 01:44:08,940
Okay fine! Go get me coffee

1227
01:44:20,052 --> 01:44:23,837
Someone said he is 5G and very fast

1228
01:44:26,632 --> 01:44:28,840
Where are you going Vikram?

1229
01:45:17,986 --> 01:45:21,424
She is Aradhya's second daughter Ankita

1230
01:45:27,907 --> 01:45:30,221
Well, how did she come here?

1231
01:45:30,321 --> 01:45:33,291
Probably Rajappa brought her here

1232
01:45:34,021 --> 01:45:35,205
Would you like to have some bread?

1233
01:45:36,216 --> 01:45:38,041
Hello sir
- Hi Vikram

1234
01:45:39,511 --> 01:45:41,780
I came to know the
commissioner has

1235
01:45:41,804 --> 01:45:44,518
transferred Aravind
Aradhya's case to you

1236
01:45:44,543 --> 01:45:51,424
Since there was no clue. They wanted to
close the case on C charge sheet

1237
01:45:52,406 --> 01:45:55,908
But we have one clue now. We have
found Aravind Aradhya's second daughter

1238
01:45:55,933 --> 01:45:56,533
What?

1239
01:45:57,713 --> 01:45:59,713
You found Ankita?
- Yes sir

1240
01:46:00,503 --> 01:46:01,486
Did she say anything?

1241
01:46:01,511 --> 01:46:02,369
That is
- Vikram

1242
01:46:02,714 --> 01:46:06,197
She has fever!
We need to take her to a doctor

1243
01:46:06,358 --> 01:46:08,518
Sir if you don't mind
Shall I call you back?

1244
01:46:08,543 --> 01:46:10,471
The child is sick
We need to take her to doctor

1245
01:46:10,496 --> 01:46:11,799
Okay carry on

1246
01:46:26,201 --> 01:46:28,588
Are you alright?

01:46:28,613 --> 01:46:31,190

01:46:39,822 --> 01:46:40,799

1250
01:46:55,021 --> 01:46:57,605
Ankita

1251
01:47:31,535 --> 01:47:33,535
Hey leave me!

1252
01:50:15,923 --> 01:50:17,043

01:50:23,366 --> 01:50:26,512
You need not worry aunty
I will take care of her

1256
01:50:30,934 --> 01:50:32,232
Vikram

1257
01:50:45,798 --> 01:50:48,207
Hey idiot! Are you nuts?

1258
01:50:48,829 --> 01:50:50,434
What happened?
What did I do?

1259
01:50:50,984 --> 01:50:54,375
You are hurt and got fever
But you are standing in cold?!

1260
01:50:54,580 --> 01:50:56,160
Why are you concerned about me?

1261
01:50:56,185 --> 01:50:58,043
Why shouldn't I?
- Why should you?

1262
01:50:58,068 --> 01:50:59,145
Because I..

1263
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:00,544
You...

1264
01:51:03,020 --> 01:51:05,408
I'm..
- Go on

1265
01:51:07,712 --> 01:51:09,442
I'm in love with you

1266
01:51:11,107 --> 01:51:12,410
Do you want me to believe it?

1267
01:51:14,413 --> 01:51:15,793
Look into my eyes and tell me

1268
01:51:16,514 --> 01:51:17,324
Alright

1269
01:51:17,909 --> 01:51:20,324
Look into my eyes properly

1270
01:51:20,729 --> 01:51:22,590
Not just fire in my eyes

1271
01:51:24,496 --> 01:51:26,020
Pinky is also there

1272
01:51:27,168 --> 01:51:28,484
I love you

1273
01:51:39,192 --> 01:51:40,309
Vicky

1274
01:51:41,603 --> 01:51:42,855
Sorry

1275
01:51:45,426 --> 01:51:46,629
I love you too

1276
01:51:55,218 --> 01:51:56,489
Mom!!!

1277
01:51:57,829 --> 01:51:59,205
Is Ankita crying?
- Ankita

1278
01:51:59,393 --> 01:52:00,332
Why is she crying?

1279
01:52:03,789 --> 01:52:05,614
Ankita, what happened?

1280
01:52:06,074 --> 01:52:07,801
Come here

1281
01:52:10,393 --> 01:52:12,512
What happened? Why are you crying?

1282
01:52:13,135 --> 01:52:18,410
Whenever it rains a demon
comes holding a gun

1283
01:52:19,192 --> 01:52:21,793
Gun? Who?

1284
01:52:23,728 --> 01:52:32,254
On that rainy day we were playing hide
and seek. That day dad was working

1285
01:52:32,495 --> 01:52:36,461
Me and Rachappa hid ourselves in one place

1286
01:52:36,486 --> 01:52:44,499
Sister was seeking us
Someone came shot my parents and my sister

1287
01:52:44,524 --> 01:52:45,332
How do they look like?

1288
01:52:45,357 --> 01:52:50,910
I saw one person. Since I was hiding
I could not see the one who fired the shots

1289
01:52:52,512 --> 01:52:59,176
Rachappa saved me from them

1290
01:53:04,020 --> 01:53:07,989
Uncle, you are going to punish that
demon, right?

1291
01:53:08,205 --> 01:53:09,793
Promise?
- Promise

1292
01:53:09,998 --> 01:53:11,498
We have not found a single evidence

1293
01:53:12,523 --> 01:53:14,442
CCTV footages are missing

1294
01:53:14,893 --> 01:53:16,231
We have not found the laptop yet

1295
01:53:17,922 --> 01:53:22,035
He had done one sting operation
And he wanted to telecast it

1296
01:53:23,302 --> 01:53:25,020
Do you know who and what was the subject?

1297
01:53:26,197 --> 01:53:28,551
He didn't share any such information

1298
01:53:30,667 --> 01:53:35,215
Recently he was investigating on
illegal mining and drugs mafia

1299
01:53:35,240 --> 01:53:37,020
May be one of them has murdered him

1300
01:53:41,789 --> 01:53:46,551
We have two signals in our area
One has camera and another one doesn't

1301
01:53:46,576 --> 01:53:48,668
And the camera is not working
from last three months

1302
01:53:51,090 --> 01:53:51,707
Thank you sir

1303
01:53:53,827 --> 01:53:56,519
We haven't got any
clue after so much

1304
01:53:56,543 --> 01:53:59,910
enquiry Only God can
grant us some clue now

1305
01:54:04,942 --> 01:54:07,910
Correct! God will bless us a clue

1306
01:54:08,907 --> 01:54:10,910
Hi Vikram, any progress?

1307
01:54:11,774 --> 01:54:13,004
We have found one clue

1308
01:54:13,507 --> 01:54:15,723
What clue Vikram?
- Sir

1309
01:54:17,963 --> 01:54:19,453
Did Ankita say anything?

1310
01:54:19,478 --> 01:54:21,707
We have not got any vital
information from Ankita

1311
01:54:21,732 --> 01:54:23,348
But you said you have found some clue

1312
01:54:23,524 --> 01:54:24,340
This footage

1313
01:54:24,651 --> 01:54:27,832
During the time of the murder
There was a procession on going

1314
01:54:28,133 --> 01:54:31,086
So I collected the
footages of the procession

1315
01:54:31,110 --> 01:54:33,996
We might find some
details in this footage

1316
01:54:35,231 --> 01:54:35,860
Good

1317
01:54:36,135 --> 01:54:37,832
Yeah! Good

1318
01:54:38,715 --> 01:54:41,629
That is why you are called
Second Kohinoor diamond

1319
01:54:52,559 --> 01:54:53,457
Forward

1320
01:54:55,023 --> 01:54:55,832
Keep forwarding

1321
01:54:56,715 --> 01:54:57,484
Stop

1322
01:54:57,668 --> 01:54:59,488


1323
01:54:59,489 --> 01:55:00,232
Shit

1324
01:55:01,337 --> 01:55:05,317
Doesn't the station has an UPS?
What kind of maintenance is this?

1325
01:55:05,429 --> 01:55:07,801
Sir, this is due to lose connection

1326
01:55:16,629 --> 01:55:17,660
Stop

1327
01:55:23,169 --> 01:55:24,991
It's a new vehicle
It was not registered that time

1328
01:55:25,016 --> 01:55:26,145
No worries Vikram

1329
01:55:26,483 --> 01:55:27,660
Better luck next time

1330
01:55:28,506 --> 01:55:30,246
I will keep taking updates

1331
01:55:30,823 --> 01:55:32,317
I hope you have no objection

1332
01:55:32,466 --> 01:55:34,092

01:55:34,117 --> 01:55:35,809

1338
01:55:48,204 --> 01:55:49,512

1340
01:55:54,293 --> 01:55:54,996

1341
01:55:55,568 --> 01:55:57,340

1342
01:55:58,793 --> 01:56:00,660

1343
01:56:07,032 --> 01:56:07,973

1352
01:56:51,226 --> 01:56:53,184
From how many months
you are searching for Rachappa?

1353
01:56:53,209 --> 01:56:54,395
From many months sir

1354
01:56:54,768 --> 01:56:59,246
He is not Robin Hood to search for years

1355
01:57:00,010 --> 01:57:06,434
I want you to end Rachappa
before Vikram finds him

1356
01:57:06,934 --> 01:57:08,028
Get out

1357
01:57:12,296 --> 01:57:15,520
I've collected details of every customer

1358
01:57:15,545 --> 01:57:17,629
One of the car belongs to our Pratap

1359
01:57:17,776 --> 01:57:22,653
None of the customers network is detected
In and around Aradhya's house

1360
01:57:22,816 --> 01:57:25,528
Those details are in this given by Pavan

1361
01:57:28,195 --> 01:57:32,059
If no one was there
then who was driving that car?

1362
01:57:33,353 --> 01:57:35,481
Some criminal minded man is
manipulating things

1363
01:57:37,907 --> 01:57:39,199
Charlie come on the line

1364
01:57:39,224 --> 01:57:41,140

01:57:41,165 --> 01:57:42,770

01:57:42,795 --> 01:57:45,121
Bring your team over there
I will join you

1367
01:57:51,111 --> 01:57:55,285
I don't give a chance to live
If you try to speak the truth

1368
01:58:00,550 --> 01:58:04,020
Rachappa who stabbed you?

1369
01:58:05,668 --> 01:58:06,871
He's been stabbed

1370
01:58:07,174 --> 01:58:09,535
Who? Where? That direction?

1371
01:58:09,560 --> 01:58:12,059
Vikram get him
Get that scoundrel

1372
01:58:13,200 --> 01:58:15,576
Why don't you just simply live on my words?

1373
01:58:18,114 --> 01:58:21,051
Sorry Vikram! We lost him
- He ran away

1374
01:58:24,793 --> 01:58:25,403
Vikram

1375
01:58:26,783 --> 01:58:28,199
What's your next move?

1376
01:58:42,129 --> 01:58:44,340
Was it him?

1377
01:58:58,565 --> 01:59:01,653
Don't you have sense which song to play
When you have a kid at home?

1378
01:59:30,465 --> 01:59:34,324
Why are you glowering at me?
I'm warning you

1379
01:59:34,922 --> 01:59:37,004
This is wrong before marriage

1380
01:59:37,543 --> 01:59:42,621
If you take advantage of a lone girl
I will make you cripple with my Kungfu

1381
01:59:42,646 --> 01:59:43,871
I will not spare you because
you are my lover

1382
01:59:44,513 --> 01:59:46,301
No Vicky

1383
01:59:49,597 --> 01:59:51,621
As if she is a damsel

1384
01:59:52,093 --> 01:59:57,137
She thought I'll get seduced on you her!

1385
02:00:02,231 --> 02:00:03,246
Hey wait

1386
02:00:08,614 --> 02:00:09,232

1387
02:00:11,986 --> 02:00:14,934

1388
02:00:14,958 --> 02:00:17,906

02:00:18,075 --> 02:00:21,574
Check who is the production manager

1390
02:00:23,976 --> 02:00:26,811
Don't insult me in front of my boss

02:00:26,937 --> 02:00:28,827
Who is your favourite Kannada actor?

1392
02:00:28,852 --> 02:00:32,816
I like from Rajkumar

heart for hatred ness

1394
02:00:36,828 --> 02:00:38,498
We must love one and all

1395
02:00:40,145 --> 02:00:41,843
Hey Boss is here

02:00:59,749 --> 02:01:01,515
Greetings

1399
02:01:01,600 --> 02:01:05,132
We are from Malavalli
He is my son Siddu

1400
02:01:05,926 --> 02:01:09,734
Me and my husband struggling
hard for his education

1401
02:01:09,901 --> 02:01:12,999
But he tried to commit suicide

1402
02:01:13,322 --> 02:01:16,726
But he is not revealing the reason

1403
02:01:17,294 --> 02:01:21,609
He is your hardcore fan

1404
02:01:21,934 --> 02:01:28,499
Please give him
a piece of advice and save my son

1405
02:01:29,234 --> 02:01:30,392
Please don't cry

1406
02:01:31,902 --> 02:01:34,507
Siddu, why do you want to commit suicide?

1407
02:01:35,197 --> 02:01:35,906
Boss

1408
02:01:37,116 --> 02:01:40,204
I was in love with
a girl She insulted

1409
02:01:40,228 --> 02:01:42,898
me and left me because I'm poor

1410
02:01:42,923 --> 02:01:45,999
I failed in exams too
Why should I live on?

1411
02:01:50,392 --> 02:01:55,374
You have decided to die anyhow
Will you do me a favour before dying?

1412
02:01:55,399 --> 02:01:56,432
Yes tell me Boss

1413
02:01:57,102 --> 02:01:59,304

Will you please chop off my hand?

1416
02:02:17,859 --> 02:02:18,808
Why boss?

1417
02:02:20,107 --> 02:02:22,443
My hand has become a problem to me

1418
02:02:22,468 --> 02:02:23,499
What problem Boss?

1419
02:02:23,831 --> 02:02:26,867
Four hair fell off while combing
in the morning

1420
02:02:27,116 --> 02:02:29,124
That happened because of the hand, right?

1421
02:02:29,316 --> 02:02:34,710
Boss, hair will grow again
But not the hand

1422
02:02:36,010 --> 02:02:37,781
That's what I'm trying to tell you

1423
02:02:38,424 --> 02:02:42,538
You can find another girl
You can write exams one more time

1424
02:02:42,804 --> 02:02:45,117
But once life is lost
It can not come back

1425
02:02:45,309 --> 02:02:48,906
True Boss! But how can
I live without my love?

1426
02:02:50,286 --> 02:02:55,703
Your mother prays to God if you go
home late Is it not love too?

1427
02:02:56,318 --> 02:03:00,288
Your father works hard for you
Isn't he loving you?

1428
02:03:00,885 --> 02:03:07,406
Your ex-lover's love is more important
Than your best buddies love?

1429
02:03:11,671 --> 02:03:14,224
Get educated and achieve
something in your life

1430
02:03:14,575 --> 02:03:18,195
Build an empire in front of those
who insulted you

1431
02:03:18,746 --> 02:03:23,082
Those who avoided you will follow you
For your autograph

1432
02:03:23,398 --> 02:03:24,724
This world is that simple

1433
02:03:25,078 --> 02:03:26,601
You just have to trust only two things

1434
02:03:27,046 --> 02:03:30,328
One is your hard work
Another one is almighty God

1435
02:03:30,603 --> 02:03:32,203
Got it?
- Got it Boss

1436
02:03:32,871 --> 02:03:37,570
I'm telling it to everyone
who wants to commit suicide

1437
02:03:38,290 --> 02:03:43,562
With patience and intelligence
You can become emperors of your own world

1438
02:03:44,595 --> 02:03:47,421
Okay Boss! I respect your words

1439
02:03:47,575 --> 02:03:50,615
I will never think of committing suicide

1440
02:03:50,640 --> 02:03:52,507
Respect your parents first

1441
02:03:53,005 --> 02:03:55,429
Understood? Take good care of them

1442
02:03:55,454 --> 02:03:56,820
Okay Boss

1443
02:03:57,098 --> 02:04:00,203
Thank you very much
We take your leave now

1444
02:04:00,228 --> 02:04:02,507
Greetings
- See you Boss

1445
02:04:02,532 --> 02:04:03,773
Come mom

1446
02:04:04,087 --> 02:04:05,515
Sir greetings

1447
02:04:07,308 --> 02:04:08,234
Hello Vikram

1448
02:04:09,116 --> 02:04:09,812
Hello sir

1449
02:04:09,920 --> 02:04:13,093
It's been days seeing you
Very happy to see you

1450
02:04:13,397 --> 02:04:15,390
Me too! What brings you here?

1451
02:04:15,726 --> 02:04:19,007
Sir I'm the one
who is handling Aravind Aradhya's case

1452
02:04:19,207 --> 02:04:21,335
Yes I read it in the papers
It is quite a critical case

1453
02:04:21,360 --> 02:04:24,288
Yes sir
Now we have a clue

1454
02:04:24,313 --> 02:04:27,546
The suspect is a small time actor in films

1455
02:04:27,613 --> 02:04:30,905
So we came to meet the
manager to trace him out

1456
02:04:31,106 --> 02:04:34,743
You are handling it
I know you can crack it

1457
02:04:34,768 --> 02:04:35,184
Thank you sir

1458
02:04:35,556 --> 02:04:37,491
Sir, it is hard to crack

1459
02:04:37,516 --> 02:04:42,078
Sir people have nothing else
to pull except our legs

1460
02:04:43,301 --> 02:04:46,203
See, there are two kinds
of people around us

1461
02:04:46,574 --> 02:04:49,030
One is 'Yes boss' category

1462
02:04:49,300 --> 02:04:51,734
Another one is crab instinct people

1463
02:04:52,022 --> 02:04:53,328
Both are dangerous

1464
02:04:53,772 --> 02:04:56,225
Yes boss people won't correct our mistakes

1465
02:04:56,250 --> 02:04:59,429
Crab instinct people don't
acknowledge our work

1466
02:04:59,679 --> 02:05:02,742
So, we can achieve anything
If we listen to our intuition

1467
02:05:03,038 --> 02:05:07,117
Well said sir
We must clear our path to reach our goal

1468
02:05:07,492 --> 02:05:09,732
Boss shot ready
- Yes coming

1469
02:05:10,351 --> 02:05:11,392
Okay Vikram

1470
02:05:11,934 --> 02:05:13,316
Let's catch up sometime
- Thank you sir

1471
02:05:13,341 --> 02:05:15,437
As a public you have all my support

1472
02:05:15,462 --> 02:05:16,224
Yes sir

1473
02:05:16,249 --> 02:05:16,873
Bye Vikram
- Sure

1474
02:05:20,350 --> 02:05:22,953
Why the manager is not here yet?
Call him up

1475
02:05:26,115 --> 02:05:26,757
Sir here he is

1476
02:05:26,782 --> 02:05:28,554
Alright, did you find anything about him?

1477
02:05:28,579 --> 02:05:30,765
Sir, that's a five year old cinema

1478
02:05:30,790 --> 02:05:33,609
He is not in touch
We don't know his whereabouts

1479
02:05:34,127 --> 02:05:37,875
But there is one person who knows him
Richard come here

1480
02:05:38,326 --> 02:05:39,226
Sir
- Hello

1481
02:05:40,290 --> 02:05:42,483
Basava show him the sketch

1482
02:05:44,632 --> 02:05:45,507
Do you know this guy?

1483
02:05:45,532 --> 02:05:47,703
Oh Gabriel! He was my roommate once

1484
02:05:47,951 --> 02:05:49,093
Where does he stay now?

1485
02:05:49,208 --> 02:05:53,531
I don't know but yesterday
He invited me to the party in the pub

1486
02:05:54,312 --> 02:05:55,432
You know the name of that pub?

1487
02:05:55,734 --> 02:05:56,507
Black snow

1488
02:05:57,413 --> 02:05:58,413
Black snow

1489
02:06:07,986 --> 02:06:11,796
Hi Bhavana. How come you have
come alone? Where is Vikram?

1490
02:06:13,222 --> 02:06:16,009
We learned about the details of the suspect

1491
02:06:17,207 --> 02:06:19,017
He has gone to take him to the custody

1492
02:06:20,486 --> 02:06:22,314
We will not miss the target this time

1493
02:06:46,493 --> 02:06:48,783
Sorry Gabriel
You have to die

1494
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,915
Did you find out
where the CCTV camera got disconnected?

1495
02:07:07,531 --> 02:07:10,064
Hello mister,
show me the recent CCTV footages

1496
02:07:10,089 --> 02:07:13,138
Sir someone has purposefully
Disconnected CCTV cameras

1497
02:07:15,111 --> 02:07:18,618
Sir, I found this mall's parking
ticket in his wallet

1498
02:07:23,618 --> 02:07:27,111

day before yesterday between 11 to 12.30

1499
02:07:28,553 --> 02:07:29,681

1507
02:08:25,384 --> 02:08:25,939
Yes sir

1508
02:08:26,290 --> 02:08:31,423
Pavan, Gabriel called one person
and met him yesterday at 11.30

1509
02:08:31,947 --> 02:08:34,319
That person has called another person

1510
02:08:34,482 --> 02:08:36,759
I want the details of both the persons

1511
02:08:37,333 --> 02:08:39,267
I will send you Gabriel's number

1512
02:08:50,314 --> 02:08:53,230
Bhavana, where are the files
of old drug peddlers?

1513
02:08:53,505 --> 02:08:54,595
It's in the file room

1514
02:08:55,033 --> 02:08:57,241
It's okay, I will see it for myself

1515
02:09:15,601 --> 02:09:19,407
Ankita got attacked
Rachappa and Gabriel are finished

1516
02:09:20,712 --> 02:09:23,907
Though I'm watchful
Someone is following my moves

1517
02:09:23,932 --> 02:09:24,892
Where am I going wrong?

1518
02:09:27,423 --> 02:09:30,159
Gabriel had called to the number
which belongs to Imran Pasha

1519
02:09:30,184 --> 02:09:31,792
He is an old drug peddler

1520
02:09:31,817 --> 02:09:35,486
He then called to 9432322555

1521
02:09:35,818 --> 02:09:38,823
Imran Pasha and Gabriel
are in touch with this number

02:09:39,017 --> 02:09:39,802
Whose number is this?

1527
02:09:48,433 --> 02:09:49,933

02:14:00,616 --> 02:14:02,534
Did you think he will kiss you?

1596
02:14:03,199 --> 02:14:05,401
Do you think it's a holy ground?

1597
02:14:06,403 --> 02:14:09,940
You showed it with pride!
You had it now

1598
02:14:16,484 --> 02:14:18,737
Since then I have become like this

1599
02:14:20,510 --> 02:14:25,284
I can't sit or stand
It hurts when I stand

1600
02:14:25,349 --> 02:14:27,253
What a cruel world!

1601
02:14:27,591 --> 02:14:32,081
They asked me to bend and backstabbed me

1602
02:14:33,085 --> 02:14:38,457
Sir, I helped you this much
Please release me sir

1603
02:14:38,695 --> 02:14:41,909
Keep helping and you will helped

1604
02:14:42,221 --> 02:14:46,620
Till then spend jolly days here
Take care

1605
02:14:47,215 --> 02:14:48,761
Please don't forget sir

1606
02:14:52,612 --> 02:14:54,222
Hello sir
- Hello

1607
02:14:54,629 --> 02:14:58,690
Old dealer Johny had called
He has given me a nice business offer

1608
02:14:58,715 --> 02:15:00,472
15 crore rupees business per week

1609
02:15:00,497 --> 02:15:01,776
Jhony?
- Yes boss

1610
02:15:01,801 --> 02:15:03,167
He is in JC

1611
02:15:04,211 --> 02:15:06,331
How can he make sound all of sudden?

1612
02:15:06,356 --> 02:15:08,034
He has found someone over there

1613
02:15:08,059 --> 02:15:09,284
Johny is our man!

1614
02:15:09,911 --> 02:15:11,370
But can we trust the client?

1615
02:15:11,504 --> 02:15:15,323
Yes we can but the client wants to see
the stuff and the place

1616
02:15:15,348 --> 02:15:18,308
Alright. Show him the godown
But be careful

1617
02:15:18,308 --> 02:15:19,308
Done boss

1618
02:15:23,339 --> 02:15:25,839
Hey Bhavana
Why so hurry?

1619
02:15:25,864 --> 02:15:30,190
I going to talk to my dad regarding
The extended hours of night pubs

1620
02:15:30,215 --> 02:15:36,091
And today is Aravind Aradhya's birthday
So we need to take Ankita to the cemetery

1621
02:15:36,566 --> 02:15:37,651
Where is our Dynamic?

1622
02:15:37,877 --> 02:15:40,089
I don't know
We have not met

1623
02:15:40,114 --> 02:15:42,144
You haven't met him?
- No sir

1624
02:15:42,291 --> 02:15:43,612
Okay
- Okay

1625
02:15:45,324 --> 02:15:48,706
08091806221

1626
02:15:50,519 --> 02:15:54,367
This is Vikram sir's station number
He is a brilliant man

1627
02:15:54,392 --> 02:15:56,976
He can solve any case
It will be done

1628
02:16:13,873 --> 02:16:17,136
What happened Vikram?
You are standing like a statue?

1629
02:16:17,161 --> 02:16:18,497
I felt awestruck

1630
02:16:20,190 --> 02:16:24,480
That's why you should not delay a case
And close it in a jiffy

1631
02:16:25,103 --> 02:16:29,603
Instead of digging a trap
It is better to dig Khedda with patience

1632
02:16:30,667 --> 02:16:32,300
I can have a big catch

1633
02:16:33,516 --> 02:16:39,573
You can't catch a hawk like
you catch a tiny bird

1634
02:16:39,661 --> 02:16:41,909
When hawk can catch a snake

1635
02:16:42,624 --> 02:16:44,901
There will be a hunter who catches hawk

1636
02:16:51,730 --> 02:16:55,089
Take this. This bag has money
and mobile tracker as well

1637
02:16:55,114 --> 02:16:56,917
Be careful! They should not get suspicious

1638
02:16:56,942 --> 02:16:58,683
I will keep an eye on you
You may go now

1639
02:17:05,260 --> 02:17:08,103
Today we have a meeting with
Johny's dealer, right?

1640
02:17:10,915 --> 02:17:14,790
Johny is the culprit in the case
which was solved by Vikram

1641
02:17:16,576 --> 02:17:21,616
This 15 crore deal is a trap made by Vikram

1642
02:17:21,805 --> 02:17:26,389
That means, this elephant is trapped
in the khedda

1643
02:17:26,414 --> 02:17:29,556
But the trapped elephant should get up

1644
02:17:30,683 --> 02:17:36,126
Who will lift it?

1645
02:17:36,151 --> 02:17:38,439
So we need to take Ankita to the cemetery

1646
02:17:38,464 --> 02:17:40,900
Bhavana.. Ankita

1647
02:17:47,342 --> 02:17:49,018
I will send photos of two individuals

1648
02:17:49,414 --> 02:17:53,651
Kidnap them and lock them up
in two different locations

1649
02:17:53,676 --> 02:17:54,220
Okay

1650
02:17:54,245 --> 02:17:56,065
I will instruct you later

1651
02:18:16,402 --> 02:18:23,417
Dear friends, there are so
many evil in disguise

1652
02:18:27,760 --> 02:18:28,804
Well done!

1653
02:18:36,309 --> 02:18:38,097
Tell me sir
- Hi Vikram

1654
02:18:38,392 --> 02:18:39,401
Where are you?

1655
02:18:39,426 --> 02:18:41,806
I've come to the temple for solace

1656
02:18:43,918 --> 02:18:48,908
Very good! How could you not pay a
visit to God After visiting the temple?

1657
02:18:49,396 --> 02:18:50,931
Look up

1658
02:18:52,619 --> 02:18:55,728
Now you can see God

1659
02:19:01,233 --> 02:19:06,728
I thought brainy and brave police officers
Exist only in cinemas

1660
02:19:06,753 --> 02:19:11,408
But I'm happy to see you for real, Vikram

1661
02:19:11,999 --> 02:19:12,924
Kudos to you, man

1662
02:19:13,073 --> 02:19:19,571
People play with things but
You are playing with trust wearing a mask

1663
02:19:19,596 --> 02:19:22,012
It is all because of money Vikram

1664
02:19:22,121 --> 02:19:27,556
The world solutes to only two persons

1665
02:19:28,024 --> 02:19:32,385
One is God in the temple
And another one is rich man

1666
02:19:32,678 --> 02:19:37,939
Before I wore the mask
I used to wear only uniform

1667
02:19:39,790 --> 02:19:41,806
Do you know how my life was back then?

1668
02:19:43,614 --> 02:19:49,002
Your entire salary goes to your dad's debt

1669
02:19:49,598 --> 02:19:53,033
Otherwise you could have lived a nice life

1670
02:19:53,058 --> 02:19:55,642
Mom, don't worry
It will start in a minute

1671
02:19:56,211 --> 02:19:58,205
Sir come I'll give you lift
It is about to rain now

1672
02:19:58,230 --> 02:20:00,377
No thanks
- It's okay come

1673
02:20:00,589 --> 02:20:02,345
I said get going

1674
02:20:02,620 --> 02:20:03,635
Who is he?

1675
02:20:03,882 --> 02:20:06,525
He is a police officer
Very honest man

1676
02:20:06,794 --> 02:20:08,736
That's why he is still struggling

1677
02:20:13,411 --> 02:20:14,924
Mom had a heart attack

1678
02:20:15,511 --> 02:20:18,416
There was no one around us to help

1679
02:20:18,735 --> 02:20:21,834
To call an ambulance

1680
02:20:21,858 --> 02:20:27,291
I didn't even have
a one rupee coin

1681
02:20:45,408 --> 02:20:46,119
Doctor?

1682
02:20:46,144 --> 02:20:47,768
You brought her so late

1683
02:20:47,793 --> 02:20:50,595
We need to perform an operation
It will cost you two lakh rupees

1684
02:20:50,620 --> 02:20:51,830
Pay it immediately

1685
02:20:51,855 --> 02:20:53,463
How can I arrange that much
money in short notice?

1686
02:20:53,488 --> 02:20:56,978
Patient's condition is very critical
If delayed you will lose her

1687
02:20:57,003 --> 02:21:00,088
Okay doctor, I will arrange it somehow
- Okay make it fast

1688
02:21:01,429 --> 02:21:02,861
Why have you come now?

1689
02:21:03,874 --> 02:21:05,498
I need to pay the bill

1690
02:21:05,523 --> 02:21:09,983
You are late! Your mother passed away
Go see her in the mortuary

1691
02:21:13,632 --> 02:21:16,273
You must pay the
bill first We can't

1692
02:21:16,297 --> 02:21:19,470
give you the body
unless you pay the bill

1693
02:21:19,495 --> 02:21:20,463
Sir, you can go

1694
02:21:20,488 --> 02:21:24,611
How much is the bill? I'll pay it

1695
02:21:33,207 --> 02:21:38,306
I realised the value of one rupee

1696
02:21:40,118 --> 02:21:41,502
Wait here for minute

1697
02:21:43,810 --> 02:21:47,806
Sir, he wants to start a live band
within our station limit

1698
02:21:48,102 --> 02:21:49,931
It's a Youngsters hot spot

1699
02:21:50,396 --> 02:21:53,611
To avoid your nose smelling marijuana

1700
02:22:03,455 --> 02:22:04,136
Only this much?

1701
02:22:04,884 --> 02:22:05,635
Sir!

1702
02:22:06,516 --> 02:22:07,560
- Take it

1703
02:22:09,119 --> 02:22:09,592
Sir

1704
02:22:15,708 --> 02:22:18,424
You said yes
Now you can have rain of money

1705
02:22:19,080 --> 02:22:24,869
Then I decided to mint money

1706
02:22:24,884 --> 02:22:26,931
Now tell me
Did I do anything wrong?

1707
02:22:27,410 --> 02:22:30,424
Yes it is wrong
I'm really sorry for your loss

1708
02:22:30,708 --> 02:22:34,510
But every criminal in the jail
has an emotional story to tell

1709
02:22:34,746 --> 02:22:38,181
But we can't sympathise and release them

1710
02:22:38,988 --> 02:22:42,775
Guilty should be punished sir
That is the law

1711
02:22:42,800 --> 02:22:46,197
Stop it Vikram
Don't try to brainwash me

1712
02:22:46,526 --> 02:22:51,041
I will send two videos to your cell
Watch them first

1713
02:22:59,103 --> 02:22:59,968
Damn it

1714
02:23:01,285 --> 02:23:06,567
Both are in different locations
If you bring the evidences to me

1715
02:23:06,592 --> 02:23:07,819
Both will be saved

1716
02:23:07,844 --> 02:23:10,713
If you try to save one of them
The other one will die

1717
02:23:13,889 --> 02:23:16,822
Your time starts now Vikram

1718
02:23:34,086 --> 02:23:35,697
Where are you Vikram?
You didn't come with the evidences

1719
02:23:35,722 --> 02:23:37,119
I will not come

1720
02:23:37,257 --> 02:23:39,025
What about Bhavana and Ankita?

1721
02:23:39,050 --> 02:23:41,050
I'm on way to Ankita's place

1722
02:23:41,075 --> 02:23:42,619
You mean, you don't value your lover's life

1723
02:23:42,644 --> 02:23:44,791
Poor girl! Who is going to save her?

1724
02:23:46,076 --> 02:23:51,439
When Karna can have 100 Kauravas
This Arjuna will be having one Krishna

1725
02:24:40,675 --> 02:24:44,255
Who is this new saviour Krishna!

1726
02:24:44,909 --> 02:24:46,325
Give that to me

1727
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:04,424
Boss sorry! I didn't realise its you

1728
02:25:10,863 --> 02:25:17,744
Fools! You know who is here?
The D Boss

1729
02:25:21,454 --> 02:25:25,908
His rage can send you all to hell

1730
02:25:29,181 --> 02:25:31,830
I'm his hardcore fan!

1731
02:25:32,540 --> 02:25:40,908
Don't try to mess with him!
Or else you will meet your fate

1732
02:25:40,933 --> 02:25:46,580
Get lost! We can die for our boss

1733
02:25:46,605 --> 02:25:48,853
Go to hell!

1734
02:25:50,299 --> 02:25:51,889
See you Boss!

1735
02:25:54,330 --> 02:25:55,038
Go on

1736
02:31:05,683 --> 02:31:10,947
Being known to suffering
why didn't you build

1737
02:31:10,971 --> 02:31:16,235
A hospital or school
instead of mafia empire?

1738
02:31:27,983 --> 02:31:31,871
There is no excuse to
you who is indulged in

1739
02:31:31,895 --> 02:31:35,782
criminal activities in
the name of sentiments

1740
02:31:38,452 --> 02:31:44,452
Ankita, as I promised I've punished the
monster Who took your father's life

1741
02:31:48,592 --> 02:31:54,385
You saved me from them
But what about my aunty?

1742
02:31:56,210 --> 02:32:02,034
As I didn't arrive at the right time
They might have finished her

1743
02:32:05,037 --> 02:32:07,573
You are lying
Look she is here

1744
02:32:08,786 --> 02:32:10,503
Ankita
- Aunty

1745
02:32:12,778 --> 02:32:14,667
Your love is really great Bhavana

1746
02:32:15,215 --> 02:32:18,323
You have come to see me
even after becoming a ghost

1747
02:32:19,102 --> 02:32:19,690
Hats off

1748
02:32:19,715 --> 02:32:21,635
Hey idiot! I'm not dead

1749
02:32:21,660 --> 02:32:25,917
So sad! How can I tell you
You are no more

1750
02:32:27,093 --> 02:32:29,903
I thought of putting
garland on you on in our

1751
02:32:29,927 --> 02:32:33,057
marriage Now I have to
put garland on your photo

1752
02:32:34,280 --> 02:32:38,682
Well what to do!
I will marry a beautiful girl

1753
02:32:38,707 --> 02:32:41,706
I will name our daughter as Bhavi

1754
02:32:41,823 --> 02:32:42,737
Bhavi?

1755
02:32:42,762 --> 02:32:44,292
Bhavana... Vikram

1756
02:32:44,396 --> 02:32:46,432
How is my talent?
- Enough Vikram

1757
02:32:46,721 --> 02:32:50,385
Even villains change in climax
But you never change

1758
02:32:50,410 --> 02:32:59,417
You didn't come to save your lover
But you see challenge star came to save me

1759
02:32:59,442 --> 02:33:02,440
You have no minimum concern towards me
I want to kill you

1760
02:33:02,465 --> 02:33:06,768
If I didn't have concern towards you
How could he came to rescue you

1761
02:33:06,793 --> 02:33:08,846
I'm not Omnipresent

1762
02:33:08,990 --> 02:33:11,776
So I used this and called him

1763
02:33:12,022 --> 02:33:12,894
You called him?

1764
02:33:47,202 --> 02:33:51,135
Thank you sir! If you had not come
My girl would have been Late by now

1765
02:33:51,397 --> 02:33:53,314
I will always be with you

1766
02:33:53,421 --> 02:33:55,393
See you
Good luck

1767
02:34:10,311 --> 02:34:15,014
I regret to say this
Drug mafia is like a poison tree

1768
02:34:15,039 --> 02:34:17,624
We just chopped down a branch

1769
02:34:18,305 --> 02:34:23,389
To completely uproot this tree
We need cooperation from the public

1770
02:34:24,616 --> 02:34:28,272
I always say this
You and us should be one always

1771
02:34:29,312 --> 02:34:32,546
When we unite
We can achieve things

1772
02:34:33,376 --> 02:34:37,017
I would like to thank
media, the people of

1773
02:34:37,041 --> 02:34:41,752
Karnataka Who have helped
me directly and indirectly

1774
02:34:42,904 --> 02:34:44,921
So what will be our next step Vikram?

1775
02:34:45,196 --> 02:34:47,811
Let's see which case your
father will give us

1776
02:34:48,039 --> 02:34:51,249
I will my daughter instead of any cases

1777
02:34:52,007 --> 02:34:58,405
I thought you will give me some tough case
But you are giving me this mental case

1778
02:34:59,183 --> 02:35:00,108
Hello

1779
02:35:18,189 --> 02:35:19,421
Save some for me

1780
02:35:19,446 --> 02:35:20,304
Soiled

1781
02:35:20,699 --> 02:35:21,546
It's okay

1782
02:35:34,091 --> 02:35:34,741
No need

1783
02:35:35,583 --> 02:35:37,116
Husband is god

1784
02:35:46,310 --> 02:35:48,700
Sir. Case file has been ready sir.

1785
02:35:50,231 --> 02:35:51,763
Why are you so late?

1786
02:35:51,788 --> 02:35:56,514
Hello, don't you know you should salute
When a higher officer comes?

1787
02:35:56,802 --> 02:35:57,835
Salute me I say

1788
02:36:06,006 --> 02:36:09,225
You bowed to me last night
Saying husband is your god

1789
02:36:09,250 --> 02:36:11,217
Now you made me salute in front of others

1790
02:36:11,242 --> 02:36:14,859
