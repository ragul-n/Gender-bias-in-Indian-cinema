1
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,230
Drink it all at once, son.

2
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,660
One, two three.

3
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,480
Have you finished your upside-downs?

4
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:11,310
- Have you finished your service to art?
- Yes.

5
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,690
- You dance well.
- Why call it dancing, father?

6
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,110
Mama just moves around
and jumps around like this.

7
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,740
That's great son.

8
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:25,700
- Sister, l've prepared the water for the bath.
- Go and take a bath.

9
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,620
l'll take a bath but let
my perspiration dry out.

10
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:33,190
Let the perspiration dry out.
Mama doesn't understand at all.

11
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,590
Yes, l don't understand anything.

12
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,340
Only you and your father understand.

13
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:40,330
Listen mama. Don't talk about papa.

14
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,610
Great! What a father's son?
What will you do if l do so?

15
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,290
What will l do? Nothing.

16
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,860
Great! My son is very intelligent.

17
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:53,710
My darling son is really intelligent.

18
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:59,320
This isn't yours. lt's papa's.
This is yours.

19
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,630
- Sorry, it was a mistake.
- Go now.

20
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,220
Son, let's take a bath now.

21
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,540
The darling son will take a bath now.

22
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:13,720
The darling son will take of his clothes.

23
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:19,920
The darling son will
now take off his briefs.

24
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:23,470
- Why?
- l'm grown up now.

25
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,910
Stop behaving like a grown
up and take off the briefs.

26
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:30,030
- l feel shy.
- Oh, you feel shy?

27
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,930
Forget that, take them off now.

28
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:35,060
Have you ever been naked
before me? Then why should l?

29
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,680
Okay dear. You sit down.

30
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,700
You'll be late for school.
Let's bathe now.

31
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:47,160
Hail God

32
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,550
l've heard it, big officer.

33
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,700
How late does mama
make us? Come on, papa.

34
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:06,160
- Give me a kiss.
- Sweet or sour? - Sweet.

35
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,590
Take it.

36
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,350
- Sweet or sour.
- Get lost. - Bye.

37
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:22,270
Greetings, Mr. Amar. Greetings
Lala and greetings uncle.

38
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:24,800
Live long son and may
God keep you happy.

39
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,490
- Bye, dear.
- Bye.

40
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:02,760
- Have you got all the bags?
- Yes, l have. - Okay go.

41
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,530
- Take care of the bags
and see that they don't fall. - Yes.

42
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,950
Why are there fifty bags, Athar Singh?

43
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,730
- l'll make them sixty if you want.
- Sixty?

44
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,790
- Shall l write sixty then?
- You can write seventy if you want.

45
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:37,910
No, only eat as much as you
can digest. Sixty is alright.

46
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:41,380
One bag of cement
takes ten bags of sand.

47
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,970
Write seventy and l'll add
twenty bags of sand to it.

48
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,140
No, dishonesty to the
extent of 10 bags is enough.

49
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,590
Put ten bags of sand
and that'll be enough.

50
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:54,120
You're not a brave-hearted man.
Had l been in your place...

51
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,410
then l'd have become
a competitive contractor alongside Prakash.

52
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:00,090
Cut it, wrestler. What's the use
of becoming a contractor?

53
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,740
You're the driver
and l'm the warehouse manager.

54
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:06,070
Just do your work
and fill your pockets.

55
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:10,380
Listen, cowardice and dishonesty
don't go together.

56
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:16,650
No, wrestler. l'm not a coward
but l feel scared.

57
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,760
l'm always your partner in this.

58
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:23,020
- l'll take all the blame on me.
- Very good.

59
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,740
- Just see that you don't leave me alone.
- Yes, manager.

60
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,390
- Greetings Mr. Amar.
- Greetings.

61
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:35,510
- Are you sending the cement
across the river? - Yes

62
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,110
How many bags are there?

63
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,760
- Sixty bags.
- Okay.

64
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,200
- ls the boss inside?
- Yes, they're all waiting for you.

65
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,360
- Come in Amar.
- Tiger, silent and come here.

66
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:08,990
l thought that you'd hired
a new manager in my place.

67
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,260
He's very intelligent, no doubt.

68
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,480
And you don't have to pay him, either?

69
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,510
One of my friends gave him to me.
He's a faithful companion.

70
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,290
l need a companion too.

71
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,690
You found a companion,
and a dog at that.

72
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:24,060
Mr. Prakash, find a life
companion for yourself.

73
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,460
l don't think God made a girl for me.

74
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,880
What type of a girl are you looking for?

75
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,000
Shall l search for a girl for you?

76
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,920
The innocence of the village,
the sophistication of the city...

77
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:39,890
the manners of Lucknow, the color
of Kashmir, and the style of Bengal.

78
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:43,200
ls this a girl or the
geography of lndia?

79
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:46,430
Every bachelor has to read
this geography. Understand?

80
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,110
Forget these discussions.

81
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,580
There's a letter
from the chief engineer...

82
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,160
that the cement is adulterated.

83
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,600
Adulterated? How is that possible?

84
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,270
Must be mistaken.

85
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,790
What shall we do about it?

86
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,880
lt's your responsibility
and l you know. l'm leaving.

87
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,300
Tiger come.

88
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,290
A dog's ringing the bell.

89
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,690
You know how to ring the
bell but you can't read?

90
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,770
This is Mr. Prakash's residence...

91
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,170
and not a meat shop. Go away.

92
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,480
Will you leave or shall l use my shoes?

93
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,160
Why are you sitting there?

94
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:04,790
- So it's you who brought this tiger cub.
- What happened?

95
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,000
You're laughing and my life's in danger.

96
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:12,840
- Call him off.
- Tiger, come. come. - Come.

97
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:21,030
Sir, take him back where you got him...

98
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,070
- or else he'll finish me.
- Really?

99
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:26,910
- Yes. - Get some
milk for him. - Milk?

100
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,330
People don't have bread
and the dog gets milk.

101
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,970
What's it to me?
l'll get whatever you ask me to.

102
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,690
Sit.

103
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,040
Listen Tiger.

104
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,920
Pyarelal is a good man.

105
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,600
You treat him well. Got it?

106
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,210
That's good Tiger.

107
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,680
Here, l've brought the milk.

108
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,870
How will he drink, from the glass?

109
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,530
l've brought a dish and a spoon too.

110
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,960
Tell me. What else should l
bring for the honorable dog?

111
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:04,810
Some eggs, toast, omelette or cigarettes?

112
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,600
Cigarettes? Now shut up.

113
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:08,630
l'll have to remain quiet
from now on.

114
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,650
l won't be able
to match him in barking.

115
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,590
No, l'm not telling you anything.

116
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,260
You drink your milk peacefully.

117
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,610
Where did you get this botheration from?

118
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:22,720
- An English friend gave him to me.
- The Englishman had only a dog to give you?

119
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:24,830
He could've given you a cow
to provide milk.

120
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:26,970
Every morning we'd have the
auspicious chance of seeing a cow.

121
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:29,350
You don't know Pyarelal.
He is a good animal.

122
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,500
- He'll guard the house.
- Yes, l was stealing in the house.

123
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:35,490
He'll guard the house from theft.
You've brought a nice caretaker.

124
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,630
What are you talking about?
l brought this for you...

125
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:39,430
- to keep you company.
- Sir...

126
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,550
if one could have
companionship with dogs and cats...

127
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,560
then is the world mad
that it marries?

128
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:47,020
That's it Pyarelal.
You want to get married now?

129
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,320
No. l'm not talking about
my marriage but about yours.

130
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,620
l went to Mr. Amar's house yesterday...

131
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:56,250
and was very happy
seeing his wife and child.

132
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,360
What a house it is. lt's heaven.

133
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:52,280
The damsel is all set
to meet her beloved

134
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,690
Her eyes are all mischievous and...

135
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,910
her mind is full of the beloved

136
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:17,330
The damsel is all set
to meet her beloved

137
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:51,140
She has made-up her eyes
and let her hair fall loose

138
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:01,290
She uses her veil as her shield

139
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,840
The bangles are jingling
and her vermillion shining

140
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:18,270
She is swaying her way
into the street of her beloved

141
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,320
The damsel is all set
to meet her beloved

142
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,640
Her eyes are all mischievous and...

143
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,930
her mind is full of the beloved

144
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,050
The damsel is all set
to meet her beloved

145
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,110
She has a tender body
that has shaken a lot

146
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,450
Her own shadow has become her enemy

147
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:23,430
She doesn't take off her veil
and doesn't say anything

148
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:36,000
She is walking on the street
very carefully

149
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,080
The damsel is all set
to meet her beloved

150
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:46,460
Her eyes are all mischievous and...

151
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,610
her mind is full of the beloved

152
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,700
The damsel is all set
to meet her beloved

153
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:11,100
- Dear son, what happened?
- Mama isn't letting me dance.

154
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,280
Only that?

155
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:16,370
Come, l'll teach my darling
son how to dance. - Come. - Come.

156
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,910
l'm the son of a Raja (king)
and Raja is my name.

157
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,130
The darling son will dance and
the whole village will watch.

158
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,190
Come on son, let's dance
in competition with your mother.

159
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:35,730
- Okay, papa l'll be right back.
- Okay.

160
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:04,810
See, my son has become
a queen from a king.

161
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:08,920
- Papa, play the drum.
- Really? Should l have to play the drum too?

162
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,070
- Shobha, you also play the drum.
- l'll play.

163
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,520
Dance.

164
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,450
l'm coming.

165
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:32,520
l'm coming to catch Raja.

166
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,810
Hide, my darling son.

167
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,410
Have you hidden?

168
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,480
Come.

169
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:49,540
Where are you? l can't see you.

170
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:01,360
- Caught you.
- No, papa told you.

171
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,980
No, son. l didn't tell her.

172
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:07,160
When your chance comes,
you're weeping. Now shut your eyes.

173
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:08,940
Okay, l'll close my eyes.

174
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:11,640
- Papa, you also come.
- Okay son, come.

175
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,040
Not like this. Like this.

176
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:23,270
Don't look.

177
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:25,130
l won't.

178
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,110
'Hide yourself like the grain.'

179
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:33,220
'The princess is coming.'

180
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,900
Come.

181
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:38,680
- What time?
- 2:30.

182
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:44,070
ls it daytime or nighttime?

183
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:45,910
Night.

184
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:47,630
Where?

185
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:55,850
Where are you?
l'll find wherever you are.

186
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,260
Not here, either.

187
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,540
- Have you played hide and seek before?
- Yes.

188
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,240
When?

189
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,960
Four years ago.

190
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,640
With whom?

191
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:13,170
With the one who's
the father of this little one.

192
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:19,920
- Malati!
- Caught you.

193
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,080
- Now it's your turn, papa.
- Not today but tomorrow.

194
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:25,310
- Go and drink your milk.
- Raja will now drink his milk.

195
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:28,430
Raja will now drink his milk.
He'll come back like a tiger.

196
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,910
Malati, are you happy?

197
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,010
Why do you always ask that question?

198
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,060
Because there's no one else
who can ask after your well-being.

199
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:45,850
Mother-in-law, father-in-law,
parents or brothers and sisters.

200
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,780
You have no one in this world.

201
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,070
You're here.

202
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,880
That's why l ask you.

203
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:59,080
My God knows how happy l am.

204
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,490
Only the fortunate get a husband
like you and a son like Raja.

205
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:07,260
Raja is alright. He's really the king.

206
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,770
But me? l'm an orphan
brought up in an orphanage.

207
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,910
As if l was raised in the palace.

208
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,570
You could've gone into one.

209
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,420
These tender hands...

210
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:25,350
these big eyes
and this beautiful face...

211
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:28,370
any one would've taken
you as the apple of his eye.

212
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:34,120
But l wanted to sit at these feet
and worship these feet.

213
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,690
Can anyone be happier than me?

214
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:41,650
l am.

215
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,280
Whenever l look,
you two are whispering something.

216
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,260
No one seems to care for me.

217
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,260
That won't be allowed here.

218
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:50,340
l'm the king here. Understood?

219
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:54,900
- Then command, oh king.
- l want a monkey that claps.

220
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,860
- l see.
- You're here for that Raja.

221
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,170
Don't speak when the king speaks.

222
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,260
- Oh! - l apologise for that, king.
- Okay l forgive you.

223
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:09,910
- Naughty!
- Papa, let's sing that song together.

224
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,830
- Papa, may l tell you something?
- What, child?

225
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,610
- Tomorrow is a holiday for me.
- Then what?

226
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,430
l'll go on an outing tomorrow.

227
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,620
Okay, then all of us will go out
with the darling son tomorrow.

228
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,500
The days of merry making
have come once again

229
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:03,610
The surroundings are swaying
all colorful  and bright

230
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:07,400
On the banks of the river
the cuckoo is calling

231
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,550
The whole world has
sown the seeds of love

232
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,760
See, the wind is swaying
and moving about

233
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:53,930
The buds are all drowsy
with the stupor of love

234
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,460
The bees are all calling out
at the doorsteps of the flowers

235
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:17,400
Your crazy lover has come
and is awaiting you.

236
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,960
The days of merry making
have come once again

237
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:29,070
The surroundings are swaying
all colorful  and bright

238
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:33,010
On the banks of the river
the cuckoo is calling

239
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:37,060
The whole world has
sown the seeds of love

240
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,880
The mind is also swaying
along with the clouds

241
00:26:56,190 --> 00:27:00,100
ln the garden, the birds are also
calling out to their beloveds

242
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:15,600
The weather that is colorful 
is giving signals to you

243
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:23,610
Sing out all thoughts of displeasure
that are in you

244
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:31,150
The days of merry making
have come once again

245
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:35,200
The surroundings are swaying
all colorful  and bright

246
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:39,160
On the banks of the river
the cuckoo is calling

247
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,690
The whole world has
sown the seeds of love

248
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,980
Come.

249
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:51,570
- My darling son.
- Papa, call mummy in too.

250
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:55,530
How to get her in?
She's gone far away from us.

251
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,150
Okay, l'll tell you something.

252
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,700
Okay, that's fine.

253
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,100
- What's the matter?
- What happened?

254
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,450
l'm freezing. Get me out of the water.

255
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,800
Yes, the darling son is feeling cold,
so take him out. Hold him.

256
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,890
Why is our company truck here?

257
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,000
Yes Lala, have you
unloaded all the bags?

258
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:45,450
- Yes, l have.
- There are 20 bags.

259
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:48,760
You said there'd be 25.

260
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:53,610
- What to do? The owner is blind.
- May God keep him blind.

261
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,820
But his manager has four eyes.

262
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,100
l take a lot of trouble to hoodwink him
and bring these bags to you.

263
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,700
lf only that manager hadn't been there...

264
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:04,690
l'd have brought
the whole warehouse to you.

265
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:10,620
But Athar Singh, you charge too much.

266
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:14,970
Call it cheap.
lt's because of Mr. Prakash's company.

267
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,270
Otherwise, you'd never
have seen this material.

268
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:21,470
And this money
wouldn't have been seen, either.

269
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:25,310
- You?
- Give it to me and l'll keep it.

270
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:30,190
Don't get scared.
Where do we get such money?

271
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,740
We don't even get to see them.

272
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,920
May your integrity remain like this.

273
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:37,990
You're really a loyal fellow.

274
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:44,240
- What's your name?
- Name? How does it concern you?

275
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:46,360
l'm concerned and that's
why l'm asking you.

276
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,330
You bought the company's cement.

277
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:54,000
This adult man has sold it
and l've bought it.

278
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:55,530
Where's the wrong in that?

279
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,960
Don't you know
you've bought stolen goods?

280
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,740
How should l know that?

281
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,820
You've bought it; you should know it.

282
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,800
l'm asking you your name.

283
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:07,210
- Mancharam Lohia.
- Fine, go now.

284
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,350
Come, drive the truck.

285
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:21,590
Malati, come. Son, come.

286
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:27,020
l'm really innocent Mr. Amar.

287
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:31,320
l don't know how he stole those bags.

288
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:33,990
l swear on God l really don't know.

289
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:35,870
You should have known.

290
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,750
Yes, l should've known.

291
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:42,250
l was very careful but that
ruffian hoodwinked me and stole.

292
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,970
l'll be more careful in the future...

293
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:46,730
and you forgive me
just this one time.

294
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,530
You're only been fired this time...

295
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,810
and won't be fired in the future.

296
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,590
Don't give me such a big punishment...

297
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,670
for such a small mistake.

298
00:31:57,270 --> 00:32:00,210
lt's only a small mistake.
Hence you're only being fired.

299
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:02,850
Otherwise like that cheat Athar Singh...

300
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,800
you'd also be put behind bars.

301
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:08,400
Just forgive me for this time.

302
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:11,100
Biharilal, l'm only an
employee in this company...

303
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,690
and not its owner.
l have some responsibilities, too.

304
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,370
l have a small child.

305
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:18,430
lf not on me, show some
mercy on that child.

306
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,770
l sympathize with your child...

307
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:23,630
but l regret l can't do anything.

308
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:30,750
Take this.
lt's made of clarified butter...

309
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,900
and l got them made
especially for you.

310
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,270
Clarified butter is now
only used in medicines.

311
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:43,880
Anyway, have you had a son?

312
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:47,640
How can l have a son?
My wife died six years ago.

313
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,250
Take this.

314
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:51,810
This is a Karachi sweet.

315
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:56,650
The friends who bring this
from Karachi don't come anymore.

316
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,060
How can the sweet come from there?

317
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,670
But it is good.
Did you win the lottery?

318
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,660
Where do l have such luck?

319
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:10,120
Take this. Sweets from Calcutta.

320
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,220
All that about Calcutta is false.

321
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:16,110
Have you got some buried treasure?

322
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,930
What do you say about hidden treasure?

323
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,250
l lost even what l had.

324
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:24,850
Anyway. Take this. Sweets from Mathura.

325
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:27,620
lt is only Mathura for namesake.

326
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:31,560
Tell me, what's up?
Did you get a pay raise?

327
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,680
The pay has been stopped, Pyarelal.

328
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:36,370
l'm being pounded like
wheat for no fault.

329
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:39,870
Athar Singh did the stealing
and l've been punished.

330
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:42,610
Mr. Amar has thrown me out of my job.

331
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:46,660
Please recommend my case to your master.

332
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,540
You tell me, whether l
can ever be dishonest.

333
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:51,780
- Your dishonesty is caught here.
- How?

334
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,420
These aren't sweets but bribes.

335
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:58,350
- Only the dishonest offer bribes.
- What are you saying?

336
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:00,430
l'm calling a dishonest fellow
a dishonest fellow.

337
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,610
You've ruined my morals, too.

338
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:04,730
l'll have to eat some purgatives now.

339
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:07,050
Pyarelal, you seem to be a traitor.

340
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:11,010
Say that l only ate the
sweets from a traitor.

341
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:15,350
Oh God! Thanks for not
turning me into a traitor.

342
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:17,340
Now take these away from here.

343
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:20,960
Pyarelal, l came to you
with a lot of hope.

344
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:23,690
You just have to say a few words.

345
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:27,100
You're a dishonest man and wouldn't
understand the value of words.

346
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,320
l won't say anything to the master.

347
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:33,329
Okay, at least allow me to meet him.

348
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:36,689
Okay, l've eaten your sweets.

349
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,660
Listen, l won't say anything.

350
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:40,750
You remain silent
and l'll do the talking.

351
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,700
Come with me.

352
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:51,930
Sir, this dishonest man
has come to meet you.

353
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,509
- l don't want to meet this man.
- Sir!

354
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,180
- l don't want to listen.
- Sir.

355
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,220
l don't even want to see
your face. Go away.

356
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:06,510
Why should he see
the face of this poor man?

357
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:08,590
He's living high on money.

358
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,740
These rich people don't
see us as human beings.

359
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:14,230
Very good. First be dishonest
and then bribe people.

360
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,800
When all that doesn't work
then you abuse the rich.

361
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:19,040
- lt's a good model all of us have adopted.
- Shut up.

362
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:20,630
Spare me and leave now.

363
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,160
Hello Raja.

364
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:32,400
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

365
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:36,920
Greetings. Come in. Welcome.

366
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:39,210
l'll do that. Come along.

367
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,570
- Please sit down.
- l'll do that.

368
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:54,770
- Now, tell me.
- l wanted to meet you so l came.

369
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:59,360
- Will you have something?
- No let that be. How is your health?

370
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:03,720
Fine, but l have a cold from yesterday.

371
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,540
Sorry.

372
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,070
Shall we show you to
some doctor if you permit?

373
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:11,730
What can a doctor do?

374
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:15,150
You complain of cold
and he'll treat you for heat.

375
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,340
You seem to have a strange ailment.

376
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:22,330
- Cigarette?
- No. l smoke a pipe.

377
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,400
- Shall l call for some tea?
- Why bother with that?

378
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:28,790
- Why not have some?
- Please no. - Please, yes.

379
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:32,160
Shobha!

380
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,080
The master!

381
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:42,540
- ls your father home?
- l'm here so you can tell me.

382
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:48,680
What if l tell you that
your father may come here?

383
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:53,740
- What will papa do?
- He'll do this.

384
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,660
Oh God!

385
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:00,760
He's a very naughty boy.
He commits mischief the whole day.

386
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:03,020
l like naughty boys.

387
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,540
Where did my dear child go?

388
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:08,880
Where did he go?

389
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,100
Caught him.

390
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:15,740
To tell you the truth,
when l come to your house...

391
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,360
l feel l should get married.

392
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:20,540
When l go to the house of Manoharlal,
l feel against marriage.

393
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,800
The woman is like an atom bomb.

394
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:27,690
The children are so noisy,
l find it difficult to even sit there.

395
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:30,370
l hold on to my ears
and vow never to marry.

396
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,220
Not all women are 'atom bombs', Mr. Prakash.

397
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:36,100
Some of them are as calm
and serene as the ocean.

398
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,990
lt's in the oceans
that there are storms...

399
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,740
that sink big ships.

400
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,480
But still the ocean
doesn't leave out its order.

401
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:48,000
l suggest that you find a
nice girl and get married.

402
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:51,790
- l have to get married.
- But when?

403
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,360
When your whole body shakes like this?

404
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,610
No Raja, l'll get married soon.

405
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:00,310
- Have you finalised a girl?
- No, but l have to finalise.

406
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,460
She's writing her post
graduation exam this year.

407
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:04,600
l'll approve the girl for you.

408
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:07,530
Yes, you'll choose the girl for me.

409
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:12,270
Shake hands. l will marry
the girl of Raja's choice.

410
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,220
l will marry the girl of Raja's choice.

411
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:28,170
- l was saying.
- Come, Bihari. You've come after a long time.

412
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:32,310
- How are you?
- What about me? You seem to be fine.

413
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:36,360
They must be giving you
your meal on time?

414
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,680
Now you're here?

415
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:39,770
We're old partners and
will pass our time here.

416
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:41,090
What pass time?

417
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:44,120
That manager has thrown me
out of the job.

418
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,100
l only have two more months.

419
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,920
Then l'll take care of him.

420
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:50,690
But he's already taken my job from me.

421
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:53,440
How many times l told you
to be cautious and careful...

422
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,990
but you drowned me too.

423
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,720
l'll also take you out of this.

424
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,080
Give me some money for cigarettes etc.

425
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:02,750
You've asked the wrong moneylender.

426
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,410
You must have something.

427
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:06,530
l vow on your youth
l don't have anything on me.

428
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,740
That idiot manager has snatched
my bread and butter.

429
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:12,630
Don't worry. l'll snatch
his food from him, too.

430
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:15,970
My darling son will open his mouth.

431
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,850
You eat your food and l'll feed him.

432
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:24,340
- No. l'll eat from my papa.
- Then don't eat.

433
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:27,400
- Come dear, l'll feed you.
- Then feed me too.

434
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,020
No, l won't feed you.

435
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,140
Why is that? Then l won't eat either

436
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:33,290
Feed him too.

437
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,560
ls my darling son angry?

438
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:38,990
Then you also eat.

439
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:43,950
- You weren't feeding me.
- l'll never feed you again.

440
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,140
Don't feed me. l'll feed myself.

441
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,060
Someone has come to meet.

442
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:57,920
- Who?
- Let me see.

443
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:04,550
- Greetings.
- Greetings. - Sit down.

444
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:10,940
- Tell me.
- We've come from the orphanage.

445
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:16,860
Then you can say
you belong to our families.

446
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,080
We were both brought up
in an orphanage.

447
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,490
Tell us what we can do for you?

448
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,670
We've come to get help
 from Mrs. Malati.

449
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:26,070
For an orphanage,
even our lives can be offered.

450
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,080
- Tell me what you want me to do.
- On the 20th of next month...

451
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:33,770
we have the anniversary
celebrations of our orphanage.

452
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:37,800
As part of that, we'd like to hold
a program featuring your dance..

453
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:42,330
Why not? There's no need
to even ask. Hold the program.

454
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:47,420
Thanks, from this, the orphanage
shall receive a lot of aid.

455
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:50,860
There is a whole month left
and it should be a good item.

456
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:55,920
- l'll try my best.
- Thank you. - Greetings.

457
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:10,520
Amar, will Malati be able to dance
properly in front of so many people?

458
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,840
l'm feeling nervous.

459
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:14,880
Even l'm feeling nervous
and my hands have gone cold.

460
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,200
My hands, too.

461
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:20,090
Papa, mummy is wearing nice clothes.

462
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:23,050
Both of you are wearing
similar looking clothes.

463
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,900
He shone like a star of peace

464
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:52,130
See our country of love

465
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:54,130
Long live lndia

466
00:43:57,450 --> 00:44:01,760
The warmongers had forgotten
that we love peace

467
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:04,290
That was when the
brave Jawaharlal met...

468
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:06,430
the atom bomb head on

469
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:22,410
The whole world called
out in one voice

470
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:24,490
Long live lndia

471
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:31,390
He shone like a star of peace

472
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:33,750
See our country of love

473
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:35,720
Long live lndia

474
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:12,370
How many lost their nuptial bangles
to the hands of war?

475
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:19,050
How many would have seen...

476
00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:21,440
their nuptial vermillion
burn in the gunfire?

477
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:37,390
We love you very
much and are with you

478
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:39,350
Long live lndia

479
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:46,370
He shone like a star of peace

480
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:48,640
See our country of love

481
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,620
Long live lndia

482
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:22,550
The mother earth is
dancing in joy and...

483
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:24,540
the world has forgotten war

484
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:26,710
The yellow, the black and the white...

485
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:28,870
all them have come together

486
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:50,260
Let our flag fly high

487
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:02,090
Long live lndia

488
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:13,220
Let our flag fly high.
Long live lndia

489
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:48,990
l have a lot of sweets for sale.

490
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:52,860
Sweets from various places.

491
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:57,660
- Hey, is it you?
- ls that you, Munshi? You're released?

492
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:01,230
Munshi, did you think
l'd remain in jail forever?

493
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:07,080
No, not like that. lf l'd known
then l'd have come with a garland.

494
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:09,900
- When did you get out?
- lt's more than five days.

495
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,900
- Have you started hawking?
- What else to do?

496
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:15,140
This is my ancestral business.

497
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:18,030
l thought this was better
than dying of starvation.

498
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:21,230
Tell me, how is it with you?

499
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:23,270
l've joined a clarified butter vendor.

500
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:25,870
Here take some sweets.
Get me in there, too..

501
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:28,630
Both of us can join hands
together and mix peanut oil...

502
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,840
in the clarified butter and sell it.

503
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,500
Hey, he's a better cheat than you,
that clarified butter seller.

504
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:35,950
He already sells peanut oil
instead of clarified butter.

505
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,890
Yes, there's no honesty
left in this world.

506
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:41,250
You're the only honest one left
in this world.

507
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:42,800
Have that sweet.

508
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:45,700
Clarified butter or kerosene?

509
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:48,340
No, it's made of a more inferior oil.

510
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:50,780
The children at the school
eat everything.

511
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,900
See, your friend is coming.

512
00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:57,920
- Let me greet the manager and return.
- Yes, do it.

513
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:05,090
- Greetings manager sir.
- Greetings, have you been released?

514
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:07,810
- Yes, by your grace.
- Has your heart been satiated...

515
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:09,710
or is there something left out?

516
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,950
- That was duty.
- What is my duty? Tell me that too.

517
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:17,470
- Wherever you are, be honest there.
- ls that all?

518
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:20,760
- That's all, what else?
- What else? l'll tell you what else.

519
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:37,030
Yes manager, how are you?

520
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:43,160
Now get up.

521
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,160
Don't spoil my sweets.

522
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:48,320
Harder, harder.

523
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:52,920
Slowly, slowly.

524
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:56,560
That's alright. Very good.

525
00:49:57,380 --> 00:50:01,150
Leave him, manager sir.
What was his mistake?

526
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:08,880
His children will be
orphaned. Leave him.

527
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:16,910
That's it my hero. This is the chance.

528
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:22,110
Enough.

529
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,350
Sir, forgive him.

530
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,750
He won' be able
to do anything anymore.

531
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:31,640
Never fight with a gentleman again.

532
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:33,430
No, he won't fight.

533
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:35,840
He'll never fight again.

534
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:38,930
Get up.

535
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:43,300
Get up my paper tiger.
You've greeted the manager enough.

536
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:47,100
- Has he gone?
- He's gone. Got scared and ran away.

537
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:49,950
- l'll see him.
- l've already seen it all.

538
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:52,460
He took the steam
out of my wrestler.

539
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:56,640
- He floored our wrestler.
- l'll show him the sky.

540
00:50:57,610 --> 00:51:00,570
'Jack and Jill went up the hill.'

541
00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:04,090
'To fetch a pail of water.'

542
00:51:04,530 --> 00:51:07,360
'Jack fell down and broke his crown.

543
00:51:07,390 --> 00:51:10,750
'And Jill came tumbling after.'

544
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:13,540
Oh God!

545
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:16,750
Oh God! What happened?

546
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:19,040
Nothing. l had a fight with a ruffian.

547
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,690
- Did you bash him up?
- Yes, son, l bashed him up well.

548
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:24,310
Why did you fight with him?

549
00:51:24,330 --> 00:51:26,130
l was riding and he stopped my cycle.

550
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,560
Why not hand him over to the police?

551
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,460
l just beat him up and left.

552
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:33,480
They don't understand.
Only the police can set them straight.

553
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:35,990
- l'll report it to the police.
- Don't worry about it.

554
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:37,830
He'll never cross my path again.

555
00:51:37,850 --> 00:51:39,150
You don't worry.

556
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:41,990
l'll ask the police officer
to chase him out of this place.

557
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:44,150
- ls that so?
- Then get us two cups of tea.

558
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:46,130
Yes, l'll get that.

559
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:48,770
Sir.

560
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:53,040
Give the masters some tea.
l'll have my bath and come.

561
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:54,560
Okay, l'll bring it.

562
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:01,890
Where are my shoes?

563
00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:10,330
Hey you, dog. Who gave you
my bed to sleep in? Get up.

564
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:13,130
Get up. You're not obeying? Wait.

565
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:16,840
Get up or else l'll break your head.

566
00:52:18,490 --> 00:52:20,090
l said get up from there.

567
00:52:20,690 --> 00:52:21,890
Get up.

568
00:52:23,070 --> 00:52:25,960
Okay. Then sit there.
Today l'll decide about you.

569
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:37,070
The dear master of Pyare.

570
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:42,290
l have been rewarded
for working loyally for 11 years...

571
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:47,460
11 months and eleven days.

572
00:52:48,350 --> 00:52:50,830
lt is futile to live in a house where...

573
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:55,630
dogs command more respect than men.

574
00:52:56,260 --> 00:53:03,220
Hence, please accept the
resignation of your Pyare.

575
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:07,150
- One more cup?
- No.

576
00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:11,030
- Now l'll take leave.
- You have to go home.

577
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:13,080
Let's play some tennis
and then you can go. Come.

578
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:14,580
Okay, come.

579
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:19,220
Take this.

580
00:53:20,010 --> 00:53:21,410
- What's this?
- My resignation.

581
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:23,860
- Resignation?
- Sir, it's clear now.

582
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:26,660
Either this dog or
l'll live in this house.

583
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:28,710
Two swords can't remain
in the same scabbard.

584
00:53:29,090 --> 00:53:32,760
- What happened?
- Ask him. lsn't he your friend?

585
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,370
See how innocently he stands there.
As if nothing happened.

586
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:38,930
Look, you're unnecessarily
fighting with this poor animal.

587
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:43,000
Yes, l'm fighting with this
poor animal and he loves me.

588
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:46,590
Sir, don't tell anyone.
He slept in my cot.

589
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:49,760
Really? He only slept
in your cot, didn't he?

590
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:52,840
Then what? You want him
to ride on my head? Sir, it's clear.

591
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:55,030
You can't keep both of us here.

592
00:53:55,570 --> 00:53:58,060
Listen Pyarelal, l can't
send this poor animal out.

593
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:01,490
Then do this. Send me out,
who's such a rich animal.

594
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:06,780
- As you wish. - Thank you.
- Come Tiger. - Go.

595
00:54:07,550 --> 00:54:08,850
Come, Tiger, come.

596
00:54:09,670 --> 00:54:12,040
Pyarelal, now only dogs
will remain in this house.

597
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:13,690
Tiger.

598
00:54:16,910 --> 00:54:18,210
Tiger, take care.

599
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:32,920
Listen, now you'll rule in this house.

600
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:37,180
You can sit and sleep wherever you want.
l'm taking my bath and leaving.

601
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,840
Are you happy now?

602
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:43,650
Tiger, get out of my way. Let me go.

603
00:54:49,130 --> 00:54:52,420
My uncle. Please let me leave the house.

604
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:54,650
Then you can sit at the door...

605
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:57,940
or on the head of the master
or on top of the Qutub Minar.

606
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:02,520
My brother, let me go out.
l have to get fresh and take a bath.

607
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,400
You dog!

608
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:11,550
What botheration is this?
Hey cook, come and save me.

609
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:13,400
Master!

610
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:46,100
What's the problem?
Don't you have stomach aches?

611
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:15,590
Master, save me!

612
00:57:18,890 --> 00:57:19,990
Game!

613
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,280
- Master, save me! This Tiger will kill me.
- Pyare?

614
00:57:28,810 --> 00:57:30,460
- l'll leave now. Bye.
- Bye.

615
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:32,540
- Bye. See you.
- Master, save me!

616
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:36,270
- This Tiger will kill me.
- Pyare! Haven't you left yet?

617
00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:40,490
Move aside this guard.
He's stopped all my work.

618
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:42,870
But you were wanting
to stop work and leave.

619
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:44,440
No sir, l'll not leave.

620
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:46,160
- l withdraw my resignation.
- Then it's alright.

621
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:49,180
Ask him, too, to behave like a gentleman.

622
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:52,450
What happened?

623
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:55,630
- lt can't be told sir.
- What happened?

624
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:57,280
What can l tell you?

625
00:58:06,810 --> 00:58:08,010
Hands up.

626
00:58:08,850 --> 00:58:11,490
l'm a dacoit.
Take out whatever you have.

627
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:13,670
l have nothing with me dacoit sir.

628
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:17,060
- Show me your pockets.
- The pockets are empty.

629
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:19,020
These things will not do here.

630
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:21,160
Take out the things or else l'll shoot.

631
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:24,100
- No dacoit sir, don't do like that.
- We'll die, dacoit sir.

632
00:58:24,430 --> 00:58:25,980
Then take out everything.

633
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:29,450
She's the only wealth l have.
lf you want, you can take her.

634
00:58:29,970 --> 00:58:32,750
l'm a pious dacoit. l don't touch women.

635
00:58:33,090 --> 00:58:35,590
Forgive him dacoit sir.
He's a poor man.

636
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:39,990
l put away all my money
for the birthday of my son Raja.

637
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:41,780
Okay, l forgive you.

638
00:58:44,930 --> 00:58:48,200
- You dacoit!
- Did you meet Mr. Prakash?

639
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:50,140
Yes, l just came from there.

640
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,650
l forgot to tell him
about Raja's birthday.

641
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:58,060
You don't remember anything.
l'll invite him personally.

642
00:59:01,470 --> 00:59:04,770
- Hello sir.
- Hello sir. Come and sit down.

643
00:59:05,070 --> 00:59:06,670
Why did your honor come here?

644
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:09,720
My name isn't your honor.
My name is Raja.

645
00:59:09,910 --> 00:59:11,710
Tell me Mr. Raja, what are your orders?

646
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:15,850
- Tomorrow l'm going to be born.

00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:44,620

- Where is his mother?
- She's abroad.

660
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:06,710
Abroad is very far away.
How does he stay without the mother?

661
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:10,470
- He manages it. - You too?
- Yes, l also manage.

662
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:13,620
But my father can't live
without my mother at all.

663
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,580
l also don't like it without mother.

664
01:00:15,970 --> 01:00:17,500
Take him along there.

665
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,080
Sure, why not?

666
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:21,120
May l play with it?

Tiger go and play with him.
Malati, what should l bring?

669
01:00:26,550 --> 01:00:28,370
Only the birthday cake is left out.

01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:33,960
- What else do you want, son?
- What else? Everything has come.

01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:54,160
l really don't want to go
but the work is urgent.

678
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:57,530
- What shall l get for you?
- What will she say? l'll tell you.

679
01:00:57,730 --> 01:01:02,070
Bangles, vermillion for her
forehead, lipstick for her lips...

680
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:03,420
and powder.

681
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:05,900
Papa, make a foreigner out of my mom.

682
01:01:06,050 --> 01:01:09,500
Yes, son. l'll make
a foreigner out of her.

683
01:01:10,730 --> 01:01:12,640
l'll get a beautiful jewel for you.

684
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:15,830
The most beautiful jewel for a woman...

685
01:01:16,510 --> 01:01:18,010
is the auspicious nuptial vermillion...

686
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:20,420
that she wears
on her forehead after marriage.

687
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:23,040
May God keep that precious
jewel of mine forever.

688
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:24,460
Malati!

689
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:28,800
- Come soon.
- Come soon!

690
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:34,550
Happy birthday to you.

691
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:50,790
The elder brother has
brought a bride from London

692
01:02:51,070 --> 01:02:55,580
You also bring me
a fair-looking bride

693
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:26,290
Life is incomplete without a wife.
When will it be complete?

694
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,590
Everyone is getting married...

695
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:30,930
but my marriage never seems to happen

696
01:03:44,130 --> 01:03:47,550
Lest l should get into trouble
stealing a bride...

697
01:03:47,570 --> 01:03:48,670
Stealing!

698
01:03:52,270 --> 01:03:56,610
you also get me a fair-looking bride

699
01:04:00,690 --> 01:04:01,790
Fair!

700
01:04:01,810 --> 01:04:05,040
The elder brother has
brought a bride from London

701
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:09,620
You also get me a fair-looking bride

702
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:25,580
When l talked about marriage
you started blushing red

703
01:04:26,050 --> 01:04:31,840
My condition out of that
has become like this

704
01:04:34,730 --> 01:04:38,150
When l see a bridal procession then...

705
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:41,320
l start weeping loudly

706
01:04:53,230 --> 01:04:59,050
When l hear about the bride
then my heart flutters

707
01:05:10,430 --> 01:05:13,230
When l see a bridal procession then...

708
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:15,690
l start weeping loudly

709
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:22,920
When l hear about the bride
then my heart flutters

710
01:05:26,210 --> 01:05:30,060
l fall at your feet, dear mother

711
01:05:30,410 --> 01:05:34,850
You also get me a fair-looking bride

712
01:05:38,910 --> 01:05:40,010
Fair!

713
01:05:40,010 --> 01:05:43,430
The elder brother has
brought a bride from London

714
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:47,970
You also get me a fair-looking bride

715
01:08:17,050 --> 01:08:20,480
Shobha, what happened?
Why are you crying?

716
01:08:21,529 --> 01:08:25,029
Did someone beat you?
Tell me what happened.

717
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:26,660
Okay, l'll ask mummy.

718
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:33,169
Mummy, Shobha is crying.

719
01:08:33,830 --> 01:08:36,660
You're also crying! What happened?

720
01:08:37,510 --> 01:08:38,910
Tell me, what happened?

721
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:43,460
See, papa hasn't come yet.
l'll go and get him.

722
01:08:43,770 --> 01:08:46,880
- He must be at the office.
l'll go and get him. - Raja!

723
01:08:51,050 --> 01:08:55,240
Mr. Prakash says that
papa is in the hospital.

724
01:08:57,670 --> 01:08:59,960
Yes, dear. He's in the hospital.

725
01:09:00,229 --> 01:09:03,709
Only sick people go to a hospital.
But he was fine.

726
01:09:05,479 --> 01:09:09,149
lt's our luck that he's
not fine, son. Eat this.

727
01:09:09,170 --> 01:09:11,410
l don't like eating without my papa.

728
01:09:11,950 --> 01:09:16,530
- Will they release him today?
- Yes, they will.

729
01:09:17,410 --> 01:09:20,700
Then why is mother crying?
She's always crying.

730
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:59,160
lnfancy is innocent and youth is unhappy...

731
01:09:59,790 --> 01:10:04,790
on this long lonely path

732
01:10:15,850 --> 01:10:22,200
They have come out
with the pains of the destination...

733
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:27,600
in their silent pair of eyes

734
01:10:37,130 --> 01:10:41,420
Who will tell the traveller...

735
01:10:42,220 --> 01:10:48,710
how far and where he has to go...

736
01:10:49,350 --> 01:10:54,320
on the lonely path called life?

737
01:10:55,010 --> 01:10:59,640
How long will he keep
tripping and walking?

738
01:11:34,210 --> 01:11:38,290
God, papa used to say that
you listen to one and all.

739
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:40,480
Then why not listen to me?

740
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:45,060
Either send papa home
from the hospital or take me there.

741
01:11:45,150 --> 01:11:46,700
Raja!

742
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:52,910
Mama, why are you crying? What happened?

743
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:56,650
Nothing dear. You go to sleep.

744
01:12:02,270 --> 01:12:05,740
Mama, l can't sleep without papa.

745
01:12:06,510 --> 01:12:09,060
You will. l'll put you to sleep.

746
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:18,590
Sleep my little darling.
At least you must sleep

747
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:23,620
At least you must sleep

748
01:12:40,710 --> 01:12:47,830
The days for you to stay awake
are yet to arrive

749
01:12:47,910 --> 01:12:50,930
At least you must sleep

750
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:58,230
Sleep my little darling.
At least you must sleep

751
01:12:58,630 --> 01:13:03,430
At least you must sleep

752
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:23,350
The childhood days will never return

753
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:31,100
Get lost in your dreams
and not in my tears

754
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:38,420
Why should your innocent heart
feel my pain?

755
01:13:38,470 --> 01:13:41,450
At least you must sleep

756
01:13:42,030 --> 01:13:48,670
Sleep my little darling.
At least you must sleep

757
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:53,300
At least you must sleep

758
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:14,040
My companion has gone and
my fortunes have been plundered

759
01:14:24,190 --> 01:14:30,800
My life is nothing
but tears from now on

760
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:38,040
My destiny is to stay awake, my dear

761
01:14:38,060 --> 01:14:40,920
At least you must sleep

762
01:14:41,530 --> 01:14:48,180
Sleep my little darling.
At least you must sleep

763
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:52,610
At least you must sleep

764
01:15:21,090 --> 01:15:22,890
Raja, haven't you gone
to school today, either?

765
01:15:23,140 --> 01:15:27,750
- Who will take me? - Shobha will.
- She brings me home.

766
01:15:28,470 --> 01:15:29,960
Okay then, l'll take you.

767
01:15:29,980 --> 01:15:33,780
No, l'll go with papa.
lsn't he in the hospital?

768
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:37,720
Yes, l left him there, in the hospital.

769
01:15:38,220 --> 01:15:40,940
Then call him and l'll go to school.

770
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:45,250
Listen Raja. lf you don't go to school
then your papa will get angry.

771
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:46,900
Then he'll never come back.

772
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:51,230
- lf l go to school then he'll come?
- Yes.

773
01:15:51,620 --> 01:15:55,850
Then l will go to school.
Shobha, get my bag.

774
01:15:56,530 --> 01:15:58,960
Take me also to my papa.

775
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:08,220
- Shobha, take him to school.
- Yes, sir. - Go son.

776
01:16:10,450 --> 01:16:11,910
l'm coming, big officer.

777
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:15,560
Take this.

778
01:16:34,770 --> 01:16:35,970
Mrs. Malati.

779
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:43,540
l know the grief God has thrust
on you is unbearable.

780
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:45,850
Still, you have to strengthen your heart.

781
01:16:48,450 --> 01:16:49,750
Be more patient.

782
01:16:50,610 --> 01:16:52,870
When the child sees you this way,
he also gets upset.

783
01:16:53,830 --> 01:16:56,370
Look at him. Take care of him.

784
01:16:57,100 --> 01:16:59,300
Who else other than you
is there to take care of him?

785
01:16:59,830 --> 01:17:02,190
You have to bring him up
and educate him, too.

786
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:04,820
You have to make him
into a capable person.

787
01:17:05,610 --> 01:17:07,390
Look, you're an educated woman.

788
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:11,040
Why don't you start some work that
will keep you mentally occupied...

789
01:17:11,770 --> 01:17:13,370
and can also earn you income?

790
01:17:14,070 --> 01:17:16,750
The boat depends on the boatman
to stay on course.

791
01:17:18,260 --> 01:17:21,960
lt sinks without him. What shall l do?

792
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:27,520
You're an artist.
You have the grace of art.

793
01:17:28,390 --> 01:17:31,620
Why don't you start a dancing class?

794
01:17:32,670 --> 01:17:34,490
lt'll keep you mentally occupied, too.

795
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:37,480
l'm unable to understand
what l should do.

796
01:17:38,670 --> 01:17:40,170
ln my opinion, do that.

797
01:17:40,330 --> 01:17:41,930
Teaching dancing is a good profession.

798
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,420
l'll find a good place and
make all the arrangements.

799
01:17:46,460 --> 01:17:48,260
Please send a message
if you need me.

800
01:19:26,990 --> 01:19:30,190
Children, there are two kinds of dance.

801
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:32,470
Classical, and popular.

802
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:35,300
lt's the combination of both
that's real dance.

803
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:37,540
lt's important to learn that.

804
01:19:38,390 --> 01:19:40,720
Today, l've called two
famous artists who will...

805
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:44,820
show you how the classical
and popular forms are combined.

806
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:22,040
What pain is this?
What pain is this?

807
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:27,270
During your lifetime
the pain never leaves the heart

808
01:21:18,620 --> 01:21:21,910
l was standing like that
on the porch innocently

809
01:21:22,230 --> 01:21:25,830
Someone came stealthily
and remained in my heart

810
01:21:36,850 --> 01:21:40,170
ln a whisper he asked me, how was it?

811
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:45,550
What pain is this?
What pain is this?

812
01:21:45,780 --> 01:21:50,540
During your lifetime
the pain never leaves the heart

813
01:22:28,750 --> 01:22:32,200
The heart doesn't admit it,
but it flutters little by little

814
01:22:32,430 --> 01:22:35,890
My heart flutters when
someone calls out to me

815
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:50,070
How was it that this happened to you?

816
01:22:53,580 --> 01:22:55,310
What pain is this?

817
01:22:55,540 --> 01:23:00,420
During your lifetime
the pain never leaves the heart

818
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:41,880
My heart beat fast all in fright.

819
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:45,300
Oh God, when he pulled me
holding my veil

820
01:23:56,180 --> 01:23:59,690
Still tell me, how was it?

821
01:24:03,310 --> 01:24:06,900
What pain is this?
What pain is this?

822
01:24:07,030 --> 01:24:11,690
During your lifetime
the pain never leaves the heart

823
01:24:34,550 --> 01:24:36,680
Now you all can go.

824
01:24:39,830 --> 01:24:40,930
Come.

825
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:55,320
- Mr. Prakash, greetings.
- Come.

826
01:25:00,390 --> 01:25:02,260
- Greetings, Mr. Prakash.
- Greetings brother.

827
01:25:02,390 --> 01:25:03,690
Greetings Mr. Prakash.

828
01:25:04,110 --> 01:25:07,080
lt was nice of you to open
a dance school for Malati.

829
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:09,320
Something had to be done, brother.

830
01:25:19,980 --> 01:25:23,490
- Greetings, Mrs. Malati.
- Greetings. Sit down.

831
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:27,070
- Sit on the chair.
- lt's alright.

832
01:25:27,650 --> 01:25:30,010
- Tell me how your class is running.
- lt's running well.

833
01:25:30,860 --> 01:25:32,760
Yesterday, around 4 more
girls joined the class.

834
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:35,820
Tomorrow four more will join.
l'm coming from their house.

835
01:25:37,370 --> 01:25:38,870
Why take all this trouble?

836
01:25:40,410 --> 01:25:41,910
lt's my duty Mrs. Malati.

837
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:46,260
How can l forget that Amar
lost his life because of me?

838
01:25:47,180 --> 01:25:50,820
For you and for Raja,
whatever l do will be very little.

839
01:25:52,490 --> 01:25:54,590
There was no need for you
to start a dance class.

840
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:59,180
l did that so your pride wouldn't be hurt.

841
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:02,310
So this society won't
raise a finger at you.

842
01:26:03,550 --> 01:26:07,880
Mrs. Malati. Your grief and
Raja's grief is my grief.

843
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:10,780
l will do anything for the two of you.

844
01:26:11,540 --> 01:26:14,800
Only, l can't bring back Amar.

845
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:25,780
Papa!

846
01:26:26,350 --> 01:26:28,220
Have you come?

847
01:26:28,570 --> 01:26:30,710
Why did you stay away
from us for so many days?

848
01:26:31,310 --> 01:26:33,210
l waited for you for so many days.

849
01:26:33,630 --> 01:26:37,070
Some days we didn't even
eat our food, me and mama.

850
01:26:37,700 --> 01:26:39,500
She used to cry a lot for you.

851
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:41,020
l used to cry, too.

852
01:26:41,420 --> 01:26:43,150
Papa, don't go to the hospital anymore.

853
01:26:43,980 --> 01:26:45,380
l don't like it.

854
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:47,700
l don't like it at all.
Why mama?

855
01:26:51,010 --> 01:26:54,870
Aren't l your darling son?
Don't go away anymore.

856
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:58,110
lf you go, then me and mama
will also go with you.

857
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:00,180
Don't go alone.

858
01:27:01,300 --> 01:27:03,130
Tell me, will you go anymore?

859
01:27:04,060 --> 01:27:06,730
You, l thought that you're my father.

860
01:27:07,110 --> 01:27:11,220
Mama! Papa didn't come even today.

861
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:14,440
Mrs. Malati!

862
01:27:16,370 --> 01:27:18,070
Son Raja, you shouldn't cry like that.

863
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:20,160
l'm coming after meeting your father.

864
01:27:20,410 --> 01:27:22,310
He sent this talking
monkey for you and said...

865
01:27:22,340 --> 01:27:24,090
he'll come in three to four days.

866
01:27:24,730 --> 01:27:27,150
Every day he says so,
but why doesn't he come?

867
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:29,800
l've even started going to school now.

868
01:27:30,910 --> 01:27:32,310
He's not getting released.

869
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:33,920
He'll be back soon.

870
01:27:34,780 --> 01:27:38,820
You tell me where papa is and
l'll go myself and meet him.

871
01:27:38,950 --> 01:27:41,550
No son, he'll come himself.
Take this toy.

872
01:27:41,890 --> 01:27:44,840
l don't want the toy. l want my father.

873
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:48,580
He'll come. Now you
freshen up and have your food.

874
01:27:48,730 --> 01:27:50,020
Come on, go.

875
01:27:50,130 --> 01:27:53,480
- l'm not hungry.
- That's why your papa isn't coming.

876
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:59,120
- He says Raja doesn't eat.
- lf l eat, will he come?

877
01:27:59,550 --> 01:28:01,400
Yes, eat and he'll come soon.

878
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:06,930
Mama, don't cry. Papa will
come in three or four days.

879
01:28:07,010 --> 01:28:10,180
- Will he come?
- Yes, he'll come. You go and eat now.

880
01:28:15,050 --> 01:28:17,960
Mrs. Malati, weeping is
destined for the life.

881
01:28:18,590 --> 01:28:20,660
But don't cry like
this in front of Raja.

882
01:28:21,740 --> 01:28:23,270
lf you cry, then the thin line of hope...

883
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:26,760
in his heart will wash away.

884
01:28:28,060 --> 01:28:32,390
What will l do, Mr. Prakash?
Raja doesn't eat properly.

885
01:28:33,210 --> 01:28:35,070
He keeps remembering him only.

886
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:38,200
He'll slowly forget.

887
01:28:40,550 --> 01:28:43,680
l'll take leave now. lf l can,
l'll come to the class tomorrow.

888
01:28:47,510 --> 01:28:49,210
Hey, Sheela, come quickly.

889
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:00,820
Greetings, Mrs. Malati.

890
01:29:01,580 --> 01:29:03,280
What Mr. Prakash has done is good.

891
01:29:03,980 --> 01:29:06,250
An employer should be like this.

892
01:29:06,340 --> 01:29:09,650
The moment Mr. Amar died, he took
all the responsibilities on his shoulders.

893
01:29:09,860 --> 01:29:12,940
But be careful sister-in-law
that you don't become a fool...

894
01:29:13,110 --> 01:29:14,990
- trying to make fool of him.
- Bihari!

895
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:17,620
The wealthy don't have
mercy for the pains and grief...

896
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:19,680
but they're lustfully thirsty for youth.

897
01:29:19,950 --> 01:29:21,450
They're only after some fun.

898
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:23,790
Make sure you pocket at least
ten or twenty thousand.

899
01:29:24,380 --> 01:29:27,260
Fool! What were you saying?
Why did you come here?

900
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:30,970
Mr. Prakash, you have no right
to kick me like this.

901
01:29:31,420 --> 01:29:33,460
We don't have the relationship
of employer and employee anymore.

902
01:29:33,790 --> 01:29:36,720
- Now it's this relationship.
- Mr. Prakash, beware.

903
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:38,960
Get out. l'll break your
bones if you come again.

904
01:29:38,980 --> 01:29:40,840
Mr. Prakash, beware.

905
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:43,890
Get out you ruffian.

906
01:29:44,610 --> 01:29:45,850
Ruffian!

907
01:29:48,590 --> 01:29:51,410
Buddy, l thought Mr. Prakash
was a gentleman.

908
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:54,810
Gentlemen these days are like that.

909
01:29:56,010 --> 01:29:57,810
This is how chaste women are these days.

910
01:29:58,430 --> 01:30:01,530
l should say that Malati has hooked
the right person in Mr. Prakash.

911
01:30:01,730 --> 01:30:03,630
He's a rich and wealthy man, a painted wolf.

912
01:30:04,450 --> 01:30:08,890
When Amar was alive he used
to secretly call Malati to his house.

913
01:30:09,190 --> 01:30:12,210
Now that Amar is dead,
he's begun doing it openly.

914
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:16,200
Lala, l also know some other facts.

915
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:18,370
They killed Amar together.

916
01:30:19,230 --> 01:30:21,230
One can hold onto the hands
of a person beating...

917
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:23,560
but it's not possible to hold onto
the tongue of a person talking.

918
01:30:23,750 --> 01:30:26,280
- l'm tired of listening to all that.
- Then don't listen.

919
01:30:26,490 --> 01:30:27,990
How can l avoid listening?

920
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:31,960
Here you are helping Malati and there the public
is spoiling it by slandering your name.

921
01:30:32,870 --> 01:30:35,110
Only people with good reputations
are slandered, Pyarelal.

922
01:30:35,470 --> 01:30:37,370
So you ignore them
and go about your work.

923
01:30:37,390 --> 01:30:40,080
What work? l'm going to get vegetables.

924
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:50,680
How does it bother me?
Let the master do what he feels best.

925
01:30:50,810 --> 01:30:53,090
l had the duty to tell him once,
and l've told him.

926
01:30:53,230 --> 01:30:55,410
Now he can do whatever he feels like.

927
01:30:56,650 --> 01:30:59,570
You fool, why are you coming after me?

928
01:30:59,650 --> 01:31:02,710
Am l some thief or dacoit? Get lost.

929
01:31:04,110 --> 01:31:07,840
Oh God! Either make a man
out of this dog or make me into a dog.

930
01:31:08,010 --> 01:31:09,750
l'm tired of his aggravation.

931
01:31:12,530 --> 01:31:15,230
My uncle, l'm not going
away leaving the job.

932
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:19,010
l'm just going to get some
vegetables. You go home.

933
01:31:22,550 --> 01:31:25,470
So, you won't go?
Then you go and get the vegetables.

934
01:31:25,670 --> 01:31:26,970
Here's the bag.

935
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:30,590
Now, go and get the vegetables.

936
01:31:33,580 --> 01:31:36,350
This is the limit. lt appears l'll have
to leave this house now.

937
01:31:37,090 --> 01:31:39,880
Hey fool, take this
money to get vegetables.

938
01:31:40,230 --> 01:31:42,950
ls the vegetable seller your father
that he'll give them to you for free?

939
01:31:43,190 --> 01:31:44,590
Here.

940
01:31:44,670 --> 01:31:46,270
This dog is after my life.

941
01:31:46,540 --> 01:31:48,730
Sweets.

942
01:31:49,810 --> 01:31:52,190
Sweets.

943
01:31:52,990 --> 01:31:55,910
Here you are. Mr. Prakash
is also an alert man...

944
01:31:56,230 --> 01:31:58,310
and his dog is also an alert animal.

945
01:31:58,620 --> 01:32:00,880
The only person who's a fool
in the house is you.

946
01:32:01,220 --> 01:32:02,990
Bihari, be careful
about what you're saying.

947
01:32:03,290 --> 01:32:06,630
- The fool must be your father.
- You fool! You will remain a fool.

948
01:32:06,710 --> 01:32:08,610
For how long will you live
a bachelor's life?

949
01:32:08,630 --> 01:32:10,720
Mr. Prakash has hooked onto Malati...

950
01:32:10,750 --> 01:32:12,800
and you get hooked to Shobha.

951
01:32:12,910 --> 01:32:14,950
What did you say about my master?

952
01:32:15,060 --> 01:32:17,110
- Say that again.
- You pretend to be a loyal servent.

953
01:32:17,140 --> 01:32:21,140
- l'm telling you... - l warned you
not to say anything about my master.

954
01:32:21,880 --> 01:32:24,430
l'll break your bones.

955
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:27,240
l'll make a sweet out of you.

956
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:30,830
Here eat it. lt costs fifty paisa.

957
01:32:31,070 --> 01:32:32,270
Eat it.

958
01:32:36,670 --> 01:32:38,980
- Hey Tiger.
- Who are you calling Tiger?

959
01:32:43,850 --> 01:32:47,400
Why are you coming after me?
Will you eat some sweets too?

960
01:32:48,370 --> 01:32:49,870
Come on Tiger. Get him.

961
01:32:51,190 --> 01:32:54,610
Pyare save me from this. Get lost.

962
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:57,420
Come on Tiger.

963
01:32:59,790 --> 01:33:03,140
Pyare, save me.
l'll never do anything to you.

964
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:05,030
Tiger, come back.

965
01:33:06,290 --> 01:33:11,060
Brother Tiger, leave him and come back.

966
01:33:13,210 --> 01:33:17,400
Come. l was unnecessarily
fighting with you, buddy.

967
01:33:17,710 --> 01:33:22,500
Now come on.
Eat that traitor's sweets. Finish it.

968
01:33:27,660 --> 01:33:30,950
l admit it. You can really
make out about men.

969
01:33:31,310 --> 01:33:33,300
l shouldn't have eaten
that traitor's sweets.

970
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:35,060
You didn't even taste it.

971
01:33:35,710 --> 01:33:38,200
Okay, let's go and get vegetables.
From now on we're friends. Come.

972
01:33:38,610 --> 01:33:45,000
An outsider came here.
His servant beat me.

973
01:33:45,150 --> 01:33:48,530
- His dog ate my sweets.
- We should feel ashamed.

974
01:33:48,580 --> 01:33:50,080
You must have deserved it.

975
01:33:50,680 --> 01:33:54,870
l've just done something
to save the honor of this neighborhood.

976
01:33:54,950 --> 01:33:57,580
l had just told him
this is a gentlemen's area...

977
01:33:57,600 --> 01:33:59,400
and he just slapped me on my face.

978
01:33:59,420 --> 01:34:02,280
Let him come round here
and we'll break his face.

979
01:34:02,610 --> 01:34:05,780
Tell me. Are we shameless
people living in this area?

980
01:34:06,370 --> 01:34:08,170
We all have daughters
and daughters-in-law at home.

981
01:34:08,190 --> 01:34:11,870
Today Prakash is trying to hook Malati
and tomorrow it may be some other girl.

982
01:34:12,140 --> 01:34:14,240
lf one loses her honor,
the other will lose it too.

983
01:34:14,260 --> 01:34:16,520
- Yes, true.
- So right.

984
01:34:16,550 --> 01:34:20,030
What do you mean by right?
Have some fear of God.

985
01:34:20,220 --> 01:34:21,920
Why are you unnecessarily
tarnishing someone's reputation?

986
01:34:21,940 --> 01:34:25,200
What do you know, you trader?
You go and sell spices in the market.

987
01:34:25,300 --> 01:34:26,800
He comes in broad daylight.

988
01:34:26,820 --> 01:34:29,120
- Does he think this is some market place?
- Randhir...

989
01:34:29,670 --> 01:34:32,650
there are only 2 ways out of this.
Either we break Prakash's bones...

990
01:34:32,830 --> 01:34:34,430
or chase Malati away from here.

991
01:34:34,670 --> 01:34:36,690
Yes, you rule in this locality.

992
01:34:36,990 --> 01:34:40,690
What do you mean by chasing Malati
out of the locality?

993
01:34:40,770 --> 01:34:42,420
You keep quiet, uncle.

994
01:34:42,520 --> 01:34:45,050
You shouldn't talk so much
before the district council.

995
01:34:45,530 --> 01:34:50,410
Okay Ranbir. You go and tell Malati
she should leave here on her own.

996
01:34:50,580 --> 01:34:52,380
Else we'll insult her and throw her out.

997
01:34:52,950 --> 01:34:55,350
lf she wants to teach that profession
let her go to the market place.

998
01:34:55,370 --> 01:34:56,670
See who's coming.

999
01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:00,460
What times have come?

1000
01:35:00,660 --> 01:35:02,690
The husband just died and she's
hooked on another one.

1001
01:35:02,780 --> 01:35:05,120
This you're only seeing after Amar died.

1002
01:35:05,230 --> 01:35:07,630
That Prakash is really a casanova.

1003
01:35:07,680 --> 01:35:10,450
Gangu, she's very sad.

1004
01:35:11,180 --> 01:35:13,780
lt seems that Mr. Prakash
didn't come today.

1005
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:14,900
Yes.

1006
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:24,790
They are all laughing at my misery...

1007
01:36:25,350 --> 01:36:32,500
the people of your world

1008
01:36:33,050 --> 01:36:38,960
You also watch the fun...

1009
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:45,520
the God who is watching the fun

1010
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:53,620
When l fell into bad times
they made fun of me

1011
01:36:53,870 --> 01:36:56,640
At last the people of your world...

1012
01:36:56,660 --> 01:37:00,760
have ruined my reputation and left me

1013
01:37:31,250 --> 01:37:37,700
l was swallowing my tears
and sitting smiling and quiet

1014
01:37:38,060 --> 01:37:44,840
Even that you couldn't tolerate,
oh my cruel world

1015
01:38:01,670 --> 01:38:08,150
The sleeping wishes in me
have been made useless

1016
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:11,540
At last the people of your world...

1017
01:38:11,560 --> 01:38:15,130
have ruined my reputation and left me

1018
01:38:45,180 --> 01:38:48,310
First they put me into misery...

1019
01:38:48,550 --> 01:38:51,610
and then laughed at my misery

1020
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:55,030
Oh God, great is the world you've created

1021
01:38:55,180 --> 01:38:58,550
l thank you for that

1022
01:39:15,390 --> 01:39:21,740
They've even spoiled the reputation
of your world, oh God!

1023
01:39:21,850 --> 01:39:24,950
At last the people of your world...

1024
01:39:24,970 --> 01:39:28,380
have ruined my reputation and left me

1025
01:39:31,790 --> 01:39:38,310
When l fell into bad
times they made fun of me

1026
01:39:38,360 --> 01:39:41,740
At last the people of your world...

1027
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:45,720
have ruined my reputation and left me

1028
01:39:48,090 --> 01:39:49,190
Stop.

1029
01:40:11,060 --> 01:40:12,160
Gangu!

1030
01:40:38,080 --> 01:40:39,280
Mrs. Malati.

1031
01:40:41,340 --> 01:40:45,340
You! Go and see yourself how
much mud they're slinging...

1032
01:40:46,770 --> 01:40:49,000
on my name and repute and
how slanderous they're...

1033
01:40:50,230 --> 01:40:53,800
- speaking to dishonor me.
- And you're crying.

1034
01:40:56,040 --> 01:40:58,720
Mrs. Malati, you can't drown
the mountain of disrepute...

1035
01:40:58,770 --> 01:41:02,020
in an ocean of tears.
They should be broken.

1036
01:41:02,900 --> 01:41:05,870
They should be cut through.
lf someone calls a normal man...

1037
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:08,920
blind or calls white
as black then ignore them.

1038
01:41:10,020 --> 01:41:11,420
The elephant keeps walking.

1039
01:41:12,570 --> 01:41:14,170
The dogs will only keep barking.

1040
01:41:15,180 --> 01:41:18,090
You're a man, Mr. Prakash.
You'll not understand.

1041
01:41:18,990 --> 01:41:21,340
A woman would rather end her life
than fall into disrepute.

1042
01:41:21,830 --> 01:41:23,230
She'd rather die instead.

1043
01:41:23,490 --> 01:41:26,820
That's the weakness of a woman.
That's why she is oppressed.

1044
01:41:28,860 --> 01:41:32,020
Mrs. Malati if you're bothered
about the world so much...

1045
01:41:32,710 --> 01:41:37,120
then it'll be difficult for you to live.
You just shut your eyes.

1046
01:41:37,750 --> 01:41:40,710
- You only look towards Raja.
- l'm alive only for him.

1047
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:43,820
lt's for him l'm drinking
this poison of bad repute.

1048
01:41:44,810 --> 01:41:46,810
lf he wasn't there,
then l would've died long ago.

1049
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:51,090
Don't lose heart. Mrs. Malati.
You have to fight against this world.

1050
01:41:51,850 --> 01:41:53,750
You have to shut the
mouth of this world.

1051
01:41:53,770 --> 01:41:55,170
We'll close Prakash's business.

1052
01:41:55,190 --> 01:41:57,140
We will not tolerate this
any longer around here.

1053
01:41:57,410 --> 01:41:59,870
You, Prakash. Come out.

1054
01:41:59,950 --> 01:42:03,630
You contractor come out.
We'll give you a contract.

1055
01:42:03,650 --> 01:42:05,050
We'll give you love.

1056
01:42:08,690 --> 01:42:11,090
- What is it?
- Come out. We'll tell you.

1057
01:42:13,720 --> 01:42:15,320
Don't go any further, Mr. Prakash.

1058
01:42:15,340 --> 01:42:17,830
Okay then, keep him inside
your house and shut the door.

1059
01:42:18,930 --> 01:42:20,330
Leave me, Mrs. Malati.

1060
01:42:21,180 --> 01:42:23,180
- What is it? l've come.
- Why do you come here?

1061
01:42:24,050 --> 01:42:26,150
- What's it to you?
lt concerns us. That's why l ask.

1062
01:42:26,170 --> 01:42:28,930
Do you think this is some brothel,
that you visit whenever you like?

1063
01:42:29,190 --> 01:42:32,400
- Shut up.
- How dare you!

1064
01:42:32,830 --> 01:42:35,060
Don't do this to him.

1065
01:42:35,620 --> 01:42:38,030
Brother, don't hit him. Don't!

1066
01:42:38,530 --> 01:42:40,910
Beat him.

1067
01:42:43,350 --> 01:42:45,370
Please don't do anything
to him. He is innocent.

1068
01:42:45,430 --> 01:42:48,600
She's made the neighborhood filthy.
Throw her things out.

1069
01:42:52,170 --> 01:42:55,310
- Who will throw her out of the area?
- We will.

1070
01:42:55,940 --> 01:42:58,910
- Under what law? - Under our law.
- The law of this district.

1071
01:42:58,930 --> 01:43:00,430
The law of this society.

1072
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:04,830
ls this your law that you throw out this
unfortunate woman to walk the streets...

1073
01:43:05,690 --> 01:43:07,290
and at the mercy of all?

1074
01:43:07,940 --> 01:43:11,300
ls this is your law that you throw
a distressed woman from her house...

1075
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:13,060
and ruin her reputation?

1076
01:43:13,610 --> 01:43:16,910
ls this the law of your society that
makes the life of a widow miserable...

1077
01:43:17,190 --> 01:43:18,800
and forces her to die?

1078
01:43:19,230 --> 01:43:20,530
Stop your nonsense.

1079
01:43:20,680 --> 01:43:22,280
She can live here no longer.

1080
01:43:22,370 --> 01:43:24,170
Why can't she? What's her mistake?

1081
01:43:24,330 --> 01:43:25,730
She's a fallen woman.

1082
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:27,660
- She's not chaste.
- She's tarnished.

1083
01:43:27,960 --> 01:43:32,100
- She's not faithful?
- Unfaithful and tarnished?

1084
01:43:32,670 --> 01:43:35,740
ls that because she's alone
and without support and a widow?

1085
01:43:37,490 --> 01:43:40,180
She's tarnished because she's a widow...

1086
01:43:41,080 --> 01:43:42,680
and her forehead has no mark?

1087
01:44:11,270 --> 01:44:12,970
What's this you've done, Mr. Prakash?

1088
01:44:14,350 --> 01:44:18,730
That which l should've done.
That which every man should do.

1089
01:44:19,860 --> 01:44:22,170
lt's the only way you can
shut the mouth of this world.

1090
01:44:23,390 --> 01:44:26,160
- This is the only way.
- But!

1091
01:44:27,210 --> 01:44:28,810
The boat needs the boat man.

1092
01:44:30,470 --> 01:44:32,270
The woman needs the support of a man.

1093
01:44:33,420 --> 01:44:38,210
Mrs. Malati. You're a widow
and you're young too.

1094
01:44:39,220 --> 01:44:41,390
You have to tread a long path in this life.

1095
01:44:42,850 --> 01:44:45,270
You have to take care of Raja,
too, apart from yourself.

1096
01:44:45,350 --> 01:44:47,720
- You have to make him into a capable man.
- Mr. Prakash!

1097
01:44:51,480 --> 01:44:56,620
Today l put my blood on your forehead,
not for myself but for you.

1098
01:44:57,510 --> 01:44:59,010
l did it for Raja.

1099
01:44:59,880 --> 01:45:03,740
Today Amar is reincarnated
and Prakash is dead.

1100
01:45:05,340 --> 01:45:07,890
From now on, you're not a widow
but a married woman.

1101
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:13,140
Raja isn't an orphan. He has a father
and his father is alive.

1102
01:46:33,120 --> 01:46:36,210
Mama, we've come here
and what will happen...

1103
01:46:36,450 --> 01:46:38,150
when papa goes there looking for us?

1104
01:46:39,710 --> 01:46:41,210
He'll also come here, son.

1105
01:46:41,230 --> 01:46:44,990
How will he know we've come here?
How, mama?

1106
01:46:48,310 --> 01:46:51,190
There's a telephone.
l'll make a phone call and come back.

1107
01:47:00,100 --> 01:47:04,030
Hello is my father there?
Tell him we're at Mr. Prakash's house.

1108
01:47:04,270 --> 01:47:09,070
Ask him to come there immediately.

1109
01:47:09,880 --> 01:47:12,100
Ask him to come soon.

1110
01:47:14,250 --> 01:47:15,750
You've made a big mistake.

1111
01:47:16,070 --> 01:47:20,190
You should've told Raja
in the beginning about his father.

1112
01:47:21,790 --> 01:47:25,810
l only kept him in the dark so
his child's heart didn't get shocked.

1113
01:47:27,460 --> 01:47:28,860
He's still a child.

1114
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:30,640
After time passes, he'll learn everything.

1115
01:47:32,640 --> 01:47:34,140
You leave that to me.

1116
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:58,810
- l won't play anymore.
- ls that all?

1117
01:47:59,160 --> 01:48:03,990
What to do? Tiger only helps you.
He doesn't allow me to touch the ball

1118
01:48:04,010 --> 01:48:05,510
First tell me you've lost.

1119
01:48:05,660 --> 01:48:08,170
- Okay, l've lost.
- Then become a horse now.

1120
01:48:08,420 --> 01:48:10,220
- l have to become a horse too?
- Yes.

1121
01:48:10,240 --> 01:48:11,740
Okay, l'll become a horse.

1122
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:13,660
l'll be a horse, a fool,
anything you like.

1123
01:48:13,680 --> 01:48:18,190
- Raja has won.
- Pyarelal has lost.

1124
01:48:18,270 --> 01:48:23,940
- Raja has won.
- Raja has won. On my shoulders, son.

1125
01:48:24,010 --> 01:48:26,070
See, he's made a fool out of me.

1126
01:48:26,390 --> 01:48:29,390
Raja will come with me.

1127
01:48:30,900 --> 01:48:34,230
- Where shall we go?
- To the garden of flowers.

1128
01:48:34,250 --> 01:48:36,570
'Let us go to the garden and flowers.

1129
01:48:36,590 --> 01:48:38,090
l'll get you sweets there.'

1130
01:48:38,110 --> 01:48:40,610
'The flowers will fall and we'll...

1131
01:48:40,630 --> 01:48:42,460
make a blanket from them.'

1132
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:46,810
'lf the corners of the blanket
tear, then? l shall make a swing.'

1133
01:48:47,380 --> 01:48:51,400
'lf the swing breaks down, then?
l'll call the ironsmith.'

1134
01:48:51,800 --> 01:48:55,840
'lf the ironsmith's hammer breaks?
l'll race a horse.'

1135
01:48:56,430 --> 01:49:00,330
'lf the horse breaks its leg?
l'll put turmeric on it.'

1136
01:49:00,730 --> 01:49:04,960
'What can turmeric do?
Then l'll make a foreigner dance.'

1137
01:49:05,150 --> 01:49:07,710
'Then l'll make a foreigner dance.'

1138
01:49:07,930 --> 01:49:11,650
Today l've brought so many things
for my darling son.

1139
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:15,450
- Tell me what l've brought.
- Pastry. - No.

1140
01:49:15,540 --> 01:49:20,000
- Chocolate. - No.
- Gun. - Not even that.

1141
01:49:20,020 --> 01:49:21,420
Then you tell me.

1142
01:49:21,440 --> 01:49:23,690
- Tell me you've lost.
- l've lost.

1143
01:49:23,710 --> 01:49:27,160
My darling son has lost.
Now l'll tell you.

1144
01:49:27,510 --> 01:49:29,830
- Close your eyes.
- l've closed my eyes.

1145
01:49:30,090 --> 01:49:33,680
One, two, three.

1146
01:49:34,470 --> 01:49:35,870
Now open your eyes.

1147
01:50:53,770 --> 01:50:55,960
How nice!

1148
01:50:56,240 --> 01:50:58,100
See how many things for my darling son.

1149
01:51:01,180 --> 01:51:04,140
- Are these all for me?
- They're all for you. Play with them.

1150
01:51:04,230 --> 01:51:06,110
Okay, l'll show it to mom and return.

1151
01:51:23,790 --> 01:51:24,890
Mom.

1152
01:51:26,980 --> 01:51:28,180
Mom.

1153
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:32,150
Mr. Prakash has bought
so many toys for me.

1154
01:51:32,650 --> 01:51:37,700
Elephant! Horse! Lion!

1155
01:51:40,590 --> 01:51:42,950
He also bought a train for me.

1156
01:51:51,570 --> 01:51:54,030
There's a dog that plays the drum.

1157
01:51:56,590 --> 01:52:03,280
There's a lady who walks like this.

1158
01:52:05,210 --> 01:52:06,410
Naughty boy!

1159
01:52:08,860 --> 01:52:11,420
- Mom, may l tell you something?
- Tell me.

1160
01:52:11,590 --> 01:52:15,530
When we go to our house,
we'll have all these toys with us.

1161
01:52:15,990 --> 01:52:17,490
Will they remain till then?

1162
01:52:18,290 --> 01:52:21,080
We'll stay in this house, son.

1163
01:52:21,450 --> 01:52:23,980
Why? This is Mr. Prakash's house.

1164
01:52:25,120 --> 01:52:27,960
He is also ours, isn't he?
You shouldn't call him by name.

1165
01:52:28,420 --> 01:52:32,850
- You should call him papa.
- Papa? Why should l call him papa?

1166
01:52:33,080 --> 01:52:35,100
ls he my papa?

1167
01:52:39,510 --> 01:52:40,910
He's your papa, son.

1168
01:52:40,930 --> 01:52:42,960
Why should he be my papa?

1169
01:52:43,190 --> 01:52:44,790
l won't call him my papa.

1170
01:52:45,920 --> 01:52:47,640
Then he won't get you toys.

1171
01:53:24,030 --> 01:53:26,580
- Come here and see these toys.
- Keep your toys.

1172
01:53:27,380 --> 01:53:28,770
What happened, son?

1173
01:53:29,100 --> 01:53:31,680
l don't want your toys.
You're not my father.

1174
01:54:02,170 --> 01:54:05,700
This is some vegetable
for my darling son Raja.

1175
01:54:07,300 --> 01:54:11,430
This is bread for Raja.
And this is for me.

1176
01:54:12,230 --> 01:54:16,010
- l'll also eat with my darling son, Raja.
- No.

1177
01:54:16,690 --> 01:54:18,290
- Will you eat with me?
- No.

1178
01:54:18,960 --> 01:54:20,660
Your mother will also eat with us.

1179
01:54:20,820 --> 01:54:23,580
This is bread for Malati. Eat Malati.

1180
01:54:25,310 --> 01:54:29,500
- Mom, will you eat with him?
- Yes, son. You eat, too.

1181
01:54:29,820 --> 01:54:32,290
His leftovers, no l'll not eat.

1182
01:54:34,100 --> 01:54:37,800
Okay son, you eat and l'll eat
from a separate plate.

1183
01:54:40,400 --> 01:54:42,000
Okay son, now you can eat.

1184
01:54:47,350 --> 01:54:48,450
Malati.

1185
01:54:50,900 --> 01:54:52,100
Eat Malati.

1186
01:54:53,550 --> 01:54:54,750
Eat son.

1187
01:55:03,920 --> 01:55:08,100
Come on Tiger, eat.
Then l'll eat afterwards.

1188
01:55:08,230 --> 01:55:10,030
Doesn't listen at all.
What a strange animal/

1189
01:55:10,050 --> 01:55:11,150
Eat.

1190
01:55:12,250 --> 01:55:14,800
- Pyare.
- How many times have l told you...

1191
01:55:14,860 --> 01:55:17,440
not to call me Pyare (dear).

1192
01:55:17,780 --> 01:55:19,380
Then what do l call you?

1193
01:55:19,580 --> 01:55:21,880
Call me Pyarelal or just call me Lal.

1194
01:55:22,080 --> 01:55:25,690
Okay Mr. Lal, the cook is calling you.
Don't you want to eat?

1195
01:55:25,910 --> 01:55:27,510
First let Tiger have his food.

1196
01:55:28,120 --> 01:55:31,340
This dog is what you care
more about. No one cares for me.

1197
01:55:31,650 --> 01:55:34,060
- You go and eat.
- Won't you come?

1198
01:55:34,380 --> 01:55:36,080
lf l come, will l feed you?

1199
01:55:36,130 --> 01:55:39,870
No, l'll feed you with my own hands.

1200
01:55:40,510 --> 01:55:42,740
Listen Shobha, you can't
talk like this to me.

1201
01:55:43,440 --> 01:55:48,650
- Why not? - l'm a devotee of Hanuman
and a sworn bachelor.

1202
01:55:49,560 --> 01:55:51,360
You shouldn't even come
before me like this.

1203
01:55:51,570 --> 01:55:54,780
- Why shouldn't l come?
- Now how do l explain it to her?

1204
01:55:55,500 --> 01:55:56,800
Don't tell anyone.

1205
01:55:57,060 --> 01:56:00,030
When l see you,
a current passes through me.

1206
01:56:01,120 --> 01:56:02,720
Run away. Someone will see us.

1207
01:56:02,740 --> 01:56:04,540
l have to feed that dog Tiger.

1208
01:56:08,110 --> 01:56:09,930
Come on, my father, have this food.

1209
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:16,120
- You're always after this dog.
- Then should l be after you?

1210
01:56:16,290 --> 01:56:18,190
When did l tell you to be after me?

1211
01:56:18,300 --> 01:56:21,700
l understand what you want
to say. Go away from here now.

1212
01:56:21,940 --> 01:56:25,030
You're always rude to me.
You don't talk to me normally.

1213
01:56:25,300 --> 01:56:27,960
How can l talk to you normally?
You have no sense.

1214
01:56:28,440 --> 01:56:30,820
When you knew Raja
wouldn't eat from another's plate...

1215
01:56:30,990 --> 01:56:32,890
then why the need to keep
everybody's food together?

1216
01:56:32,910 --> 01:56:37,250
How should l know that?
He always ate with the old master.

1217
01:56:38,440 --> 01:56:40,870
Old master? God, great are your ways.

1218
01:56:41,780 --> 01:56:46,100
The master got married for that child.

1219
01:56:46,580 --> 01:56:48,850
Neither is the master happy
nor the child happy.

1220
01:56:49,190 --> 01:56:50,740
The daughter-in-law isn't happy either.

1221
01:57:03,820 --> 01:57:06,000
The hands that rose to support.

1222
01:57:06,990 --> 01:57:10,640
You said it again.
You're the one that supports me.

1223
01:57:12,450 --> 01:57:13,550
What?

1224
01:57:15,950 --> 01:57:17,560
Are you sad, Malati?

1225
01:57:18,830 --> 01:57:20,230
No, not at all.

1226
01:57:21,610 --> 01:57:27,430
Your eyes are telling me.
Tell me what it is.

1227
01:57:29,810 --> 01:57:31,960
l'm unhappy that Raja calls you by name.

1228
01:57:32,860 --> 01:57:36,920
- He doesn't take you to be his own.
- But l treat him as my own.

1229
01:57:37,850 --> 01:57:41,340
What's wrong in calling me by my name?
Lots of children call their fathers by name.

1230
01:57:42,400 --> 01:57:43,790
You're worrying unnecessarily.

1231
01:57:44,900 --> 01:57:46,400
Now you answer my question.

1232
01:57:47,220 --> 01:57:49,770
lf the cost of 5 mangoes
is one paisa...

1233
01:57:49,850 --> 01:57:52,300
then how much will it cost
to see smile on your face?

1234
01:57:53,780 --> 01:57:55,280
Now, l see that smile.

1235
01:57:55,630 --> 01:57:57,900
l want to see you
happy like this forever.

1236
01:57:59,170 --> 01:58:02,710
Don't touch my mama's hair.
Are you my father?

1237
01:58:02,850 --> 01:58:04,050
- Raja!
- Malati!

1238
01:58:04,390 --> 01:58:07,130
- Raja, my son.
- Leave me. l don't want to talk to you.

1239
01:58:20,420 --> 01:58:25,270
Shobha, today Mr. Prakash
was touching my mama's hair.

1240
01:58:25,500 --> 01:58:27,920
He's also eating with my mama.

1241
01:58:28,080 --> 01:58:31,370
My mama is also bad and she's
also eating along with him, too.

1242
01:58:31,950 --> 01:58:35,390
Of course she will, Raja.
She'll also eat from his plate.

1243
01:58:35,780 --> 01:58:38,970
Why should she eat from
his plate? ls he my father?

1244
01:58:39,410 --> 01:58:42,080
Yes, he is her husband now.

1245
01:58:42,660 --> 01:58:46,620
- Who is called the husband?
- He's the master of her.

1246
01:58:46,920 --> 01:58:50,170
Then is mama his servant?
You're also his servant.

1247
01:58:50,380 --> 01:58:52,300
Then why don't you eat from his plate?

1248
01:58:52,800 --> 01:58:54,700
Oh God! How do l explain it to you?

1249
01:58:54,740 --> 01:58:57,680
lt's late and you go off to sleep.

1250
01:58:59,170 --> 01:59:01,460
'Raja go off to sleep.'

1251
01:59:01,480 --> 01:59:03,110
'My child, go off to sleep.'

1252
01:59:03,440 --> 01:59:08,140
'There is sleep in your eyes now.'

1253
01:59:10,150 --> 01:59:12,130
'Raja go off to sleep.'

1254
01:59:12,620 --> 01:59:14,220
'My child, go off to sleep.'

1255
01:59:30,920 --> 01:59:33,100
- Mom!
- Son!

1256
01:59:33,590 --> 01:59:37,670
Socks! ls that for me?

1257
01:59:43,920 --> 01:59:46,300
Mom, you don't know anything.

1258
01:59:46,480 --> 01:59:51,440
How small the socks you've knit.
l can't wear them at all.

1259
01:59:52,160 --> 01:59:56,270
- lt is not for you.
- Then who are they for?

1260
01:59:56,700 --> 01:59:59,010
These are for your younger brother.

1261
01:59:59,340 --> 02:00:02,490
- Your younger brother is going to come.
- Younger brother?

1262
02:00:03,540 --> 02:00:05,340
Mama, is my younger
brother going to come?

1263
02:00:05,750 --> 02:00:07,930
You get brothers
from the hospital, don't you?

1264
02:00:08,430 --> 02:00:09,930
Yes, now go to school.

1265
02:00:09,950 --> 02:00:12,680
Get me two brothers
from the hospital, mama.

1266
02:00:14,540 --> 02:00:19,810
lt will be two, won't it?
One for you and the second for him.

1267
02:00:19,970 --> 02:00:22,050
Yes, l'll play a lot with him.

1268
02:00:22,290 --> 02:00:26,060
Mama, Mr. Prakash said that
he will get me a cycle...

1269
02:00:26,160 --> 02:00:31,070
when l grow up into a big boy.
l'll take my brother on rides.

1270
02:00:31,200 --> 02:00:33,120
l'll also take you out on rides.

1271
02:00:33,570 --> 02:00:36,100
Raja, how many times have l told you
not to call him by his name

1272
02:00:36,530 --> 02:00:37,830
Call him papa.

1273
02:00:37,910 --> 02:00:41,110
l won' call him papa.
He's Mr. Prakash and not my papa.

1274
02:00:41,920 --> 02:00:44,950
- Won't call him papa?
- No, l will not.

1275
02:00:51,900 --> 02:00:54,510
No madam. Why did you beat him?

1276
02:00:56,660 --> 02:00:58,370
lt's your pampering that's spoiled him.

1277
02:00:58,620 --> 02:00:59,990
He's adamant about everything.

1278
02:01:00,430 --> 02:01:02,540
He's not adamant,
but he still remembers him.

1279
02:01:02,840 --> 02:01:04,890
Poor thing still remembers him.

1280
02:01:05,270 --> 02:01:09,150
Madam, you can choose everything
in this world but not parents.

1281
02:01:09,360 --> 02:01:11,610
- The father's love can't be given another.
- Shobha.

1282
02:01:13,940 --> 02:01:16,240
Aren't you ashamed to talk like this
in the presence of the child?

1283
02:01:17,320 --> 02:01:18,820
l'm not Raja's real father...

1284
02:01:18,910 --> 02:01:22,290
but l'm fulfilling the duty of a real father
to him. Malati's son is my son.

1285
02:01:23,440 --> 02:01:25,540
l warn you not to repeat this again.
Come here, son.

1286
02:01:27,140 --> 02:01:30,260
- What happened?
- Mama beat me.

1287
02:01:30,360 --> 02:01:31,660
She did?

1288
02:01:33,460 --> 02:01:37,470
Listen, if you beat him again
then l won't ever speak even to you.

1289
02:01:37,500 --> 02:01:39,130
l won't talk to you, either.

1290
02:01:39,150 --> 02:01:41,600
- Okay, now forgive her for this time.
- Okay, l forgive you.

1291
02:01:41,760 --> 02:01:44,760
- But l won't call you papa.
- Raja!

1292
02:01:44,850 --> 02:01:47,070
Never mind. You call me Mr. Prakash.

1293
02:01:47,260 --> 02:01:49,810
Fine, l'm not your father,
but aren't you my son?

1294
02:01:50,580 --> 02:01:54,420
- Then give me a kiss.
- Sweet or sour? - Sweet.

1295
02:01:55,320 --> 02:01:57,040
Now you go to school with Tiger.

1296
02:02:01,590 --> 02:02:03,540
One has to explain
these things lovingly.

1297
02:02:04,580 --> 02:02:06,080
He must say it willingly.

1298
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:12,250
- Why do you handle him?
- lt's my duty Malati.

1299
02:02:13,330 --> 02:02:15,270
Don't be bothered by such small things.

1300
02:02:15,420 --> 02:02:16,920
You're health is already poor.

1301
02:02:17,720 --> 02:02:19,920
Raja's behaviour is killing me.

1302
02:02:20,940 --> 02:02:22,840
l don't know what's
in store in the future.

1303
02:02:23,550 --> 02:02:24,850
Nothing will happen.

1304
02:02:26,400 --> 02:02:29,130
What's have you done?
Wet my clothes.

1305
02:02:29,290 --> 02:02:31,590
lt is Holi (spring festival), Pyare.

1306
02:02:32,460 --> 02:02:36,070
Again you called me Pyare.
l've told you to call me Pyarelal.

1307
02:02:36,260 --> 02:02:40,280
- What if l also call you Pyari.
- Try and call me?

1308
02:02:40,560 --> 02:02:43,260
What will you do if l call you?
Kill me? Here l call you, dear.

1309
02:02:43,470 --> 02:02:44,710
- Call again.
- Dear.

1310
02:02:47,180 --> 02:02:50,220
Call me by that name once more.

1311
02:02:50,450 --> 02:02:52,190
Quiet, someone will hear it.

1312
02:02:52,470 --> 02:02:54,120
So, you're like a chameleon.

1313
02:02:54,260 --> 02:02:58,700
l'll tell everyone when we're alone,
Pyarelal calls me dear.

1314
02:02:58,750 --> 02:03:01,540
Don't do that. Dear don't tell everyone.

1315
02:03:01,710 --> 02:03:05,610
Not once, but a thousand times
l'll tell everyone you call me dear.

1316
02:03:05,630 --> 02:03:07,440
Please, l beg you with folded hands.

1317
02:03:07,620 --> 02:03:09,530
- Then you have to agree to one condition.
- What?

1318
02:03:10,460 --> 02:03:14,140
- When we're alone you'll always call me dear.
- Yes, l will.

1319
02:03:14,380 --> 02:03:18,030
You also call me dear when
we're alone and not before others.

1320
02:03:18,080 --> 02:03:21,860
- ln front of others, can l call you anything?
- Yes.

1321
02:03:21,940 --> 02:03:23,240
Then take this.

1322
02:03:26,820 --> 02:03:29,800
Don't do that dear,
my clothes will get wet.

1323
02:03:30,070 --> 02:03:32,160
Tiger, where have you been?

1324
02:03:32,590 --> 02:03:35,940
Tiger will surely reply to you.

1325
02:03:36,130 --> 02:03:38,420
He went to take Raja to school.
Where else would he go?

1326
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:42,180
Today the master got
angry with me for nothing.

1327
02:03:42,480 --> 02:03:43,780
Why, what happened?

1328
02:03:43,800 --> 02:03:47,970
Raja isn't calling him papa
and how am l to blame for that?

1329
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:49,700
Moreover, how will he call him papa?

1330
02:03:49,720 --> 02:03:51,470
Why not? He should call him papa.

1331
02:03:51,630 --> 02:03:54,160
Why? Will you call anyone your father?

1332
02:03:54,470 --> 02:03:56,780
The status of the man raising you...

1333
02:03:56,980 --> 02:04:00,730
is higher than the status of the man
who's the birth father.

1334
02:04:00,850 --> 02:04:03,280
A dog understands this but you won't.

1335
02:04:03,370 --> 02:04:04,970
What am l to this animal?

1336
02:04:04,990 --> 02:04:08,060
lt's just l feed him and take care of him.

1337
02:04:08,240 --> 02:04:10,560
For that he treats me better
than his own father.

1338
02:04:11,590 --> 02:04:14,730
Then you explain to Raja that
he should call him father.

1339
02:04:14,970 --> 02:04:17,930
He'll learn.
When she has the second child...

1340
02:04:18,140 --> 02:04:20,370
then he'll also call him papa,
along with that child.

1341
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:41,860
Just a minute.

1342
02:04:43,940 --> 02:04:45,560
Congratulations, it's a son.

1343
02:04:47,250 --> 02:04:48,450
Not yet.

1344
02:05:01,780 --> 02:05:03,740
What is it?

1345
02:05:06,770 --> 02:05:09,730
Let's lie down. That's good.

1346
02:05:14,190 --> 02:05:16,060
Don't cry.

1347
02:05:16,640 --> 02:05:19,100
'The little brother has come.'

1348
02:05:19,180 --> 02:05:21,210
'He has had cream and milk.'

1349
02:05:21,390 --> 02:05:23,340
'Both of us will play together.'

1350
02:05:25,670 --> 02:05:28,050
Baby. Baby.

1351
02:05:28,780 --> 02:05:32,270
You say something, too.
Why aren't you talking?

1352
02:05:33,470 --> 02:05:37,230
Oh! The hat. Take this hat.

1353
02:05:38,270 --> 02:05:39,470
Now talk.

1354
02:05:44,810 --> 02:05:47,480
Mama, he doesn't have teeth.

1355
02:05:51,880 --> 02:05:56,090
Mama, when papa sees the child,
he'll be very happy.

1356
02:05:56,850 --> 02:06:00,460
- When will we go to papa?
- Go and play with your brother.

1357
02:06:02,680 --> 02:06:04,580
How will l explain to you, Raja?

1358
02:06:06,460 --> 02:06:08,550
You'll take my life
and then leave this.

1359
02:06:12,190 --> 02:06:13,690
The doctor has come, Malati.

1360
02:06:13,810 --> 02:06:17,870
Greetings Mrs. Prakash. How are you?

1361
02:06:19,360 --> 02:06:20,560
Fine, doctor.

1362
02:06:26,010 --> 02:06:32,050
Be happy and stop thinking a lot.
You think too much.

1363
02:06:33,760 --> 02:06:36,410
How many times l've told her that,
but she doesn't listen to me.

1364
02:06:37,550 --> 02:06:41,490
- What's the temperature?
- lt's not very serious.

1365
02:06:42,440 --> 02:06:44,040
Keep giving her the same medicine.

1366
02:06:44,060 --> 02:06:45,440
lt's very sour.

1367
02:06:46,560 --> 02:06:48,460
Never mind, l'll send
a sweet one this time.

1368
02:06:48,520 --> 02:06:51,570
But stop thinking so much.
Come with me.

1369
02:06:53,440 --> 02:06:56,550
Don't attach any importance
to what Raja says.

1370
02:06:56,940 --> 02:06:58,740
He's a child and
everything will be alright.

1371
02:07:04,790 --> 02:07:09,650
- Yes, doctor.
- There's shortage of blood...

1372
02:07:09,790 --> 02:07:14,720
and her heart is also weak.
There seems to be some worry in her mind.

1373
02:07:16,060 --> 02:07:19,800
Don't worry, nothing serious
and everything will be alright.

1374
02:07:30,980 --> 02:07:35,050
- What's this?
- These are bullets. Put it down.

1375
02:07:36,530 --> 02:07:39,040
How do you put bullets in this?

1376
02:07:39,190 --> 02:07:40,590
How to load bullets?

1377
02:07:40,990 --> 02:07:47,930
Open this like this and
load the bullets here like this.

1378
02:07:48,320 --> 02:07:51,430
- Then close it.
- How do you fire it?

1379
02:07:51,520 --> 02:07:54,930
- Press this trigger.
- Trigger? Where's the trigger?

1380
02:07:54,950 --> 02:08:00,740
- Then it will fire won't it?
- Yes.

1381
02:08:00,940 --> 02:08:03,100
Will someone die if a bullet hits him?

1382
02:08:03,140 --> 02:08:05,440
Yes, he'll die.
- Will a bird also die if hit by a bullet?

1383
02:08:05,460 --> 02:08:08,750
Whoever gets hit by a
bullet will die. Understand?

1384
02:08:10,850 --> 02:08:13,720
l'll get some oil and
you don't touch it.

1385
02:08:14,570 --> 02:08:15,770
Don't touch.

1386
02:08:27,450 --> 02:08:30,630
- What are you doing with the pistol, Raja?
- Shall l fire it?

1387
02:08:31,080 --> 02:08:35,190
Not now. When you grow up
then load bullets and fire it.

1388
02:08:35,460 --> 02:08:37,040
There's a bullet in it.

1389
02:08:38,080 --> 02:08:39,280
l'm dead!

1390
02:08:40,700 --> 02:08:42,900
What happened?

1391
02:08:43,130 --> 02:08:46,010
l'm dead.

1392
02:08:46,350 --> 02:08:49,460
- What happened, Pyare?
- Raja fired the gun.

1393
02:08:49,610 --> 02:08:51,570
Are you hit?
- Sir...

1394
02:08:51,830 --> 02:08:53,970
send my salary to a cow shelter.

1395
02:08:54,010 --> 02:08:55,610
Let me see where you're hit.

1396
02:08:56,820 --> 02:08:59,560
- Where is it?
- l think l'm saved and didn't die.

1397
02:08:59,870 --> 02:09:02,140
Mad chap. You put a loaded pistol
in a child's hand.

1398
02:09:02,290 --> 02:09:04,750
Where did l give it to him, sir?
He loaded it himself.

1399
02:09:05,390 --> 02:09:06,870
You're a liar Pyarelal,

1400
02:09:07,040 --> 02:09:09,190
You said that men die.
Where have you died?

1401
02:09:09,380 --> 02:09:11,460
Sorry your honor. Forgive me.

1402
02:09:11,480 --> 02:09:15,190
Never do this again, son.
People die due to this.

1403
02:09:15,570 --> 02:09:16,870
Take this. Come.

1404
02:09:25,020 --> 02:09:28,150
ln those days there were fewer
hawkers outside the school.

1405
02:09:28,830 --> 02:09:31,620
These days every Tom, Dick
and Harry becomes a hawker.

1406
02:09:31,970 --> 02:09:34,150
There's no future
in this trade anymore.

1407
02:09:37,800 --> 02:09:39,800
There goes the bell.

1408
02:09:40,340 --> 02:09:44,950
Sweets.

1409
02:09:45,560 --> 02:09:48,690
Sweets.

1410
02:09:53,890 --> 02:09:57,580
Hot savories.

1411
02:09:58,370 --> 02:10:02,730
Sweets.

1412
02:10:03,300 --> 02:10:06,050
Sweets.

1413
02:10:07,080 --> 02:10:10,750
Even the children have become my enemy.

1414
02:10:14,470 --> 02:10:16,740
Come Raja and tell me what you'll have.

1415
02:10:16,970 --> 02:10:20,970
l don't want anything.
l don't eat stuff made with oil.

1416
02:10:21,360 --> 02:10:25,370
Okay then don't eat.
Tell me, how is your mother?

1417
02:10:25,950 --> 02:10:28,620
- Mother is ill.
- And your father?

1418
02:10:29,500 --> 02:10:31,320
He's in the hospital.

1419
02:10:31,840 --> 02:10:35,020
Hospital? Mr. Prakash in the hospital?
What happened to him?

1420
02:10:35,740 --> 02:10:38,560
Not Mr. Prakash but my papa.

1421
02:10:38,600 --> 02:10:43,870
Oh your father! How will he come?

1422
02:10:44,070 --> 02:10:47,710
Why won't he come?
Mr. Prakash says he'll come soon.

1423
02:10:49,510 --> 02:10:51,310
Has anyone ever gone there
and come back?

1424
02:10:52,350 --> 02:10:55,550
He's dead Raja.
He'll never come back.

1425
02:10:56,850 --> 02:10:59,120
Mr. Prakash was the one who killed him.

1426
02:11:00,050 --> 02:11:06,150
- Mr. Prakash killed him?
- Yes, Mr. Prakash killed him.

1427
02:11:06,690 --> 02:11:09,710
- Are you telling the truth?
- Why should l tell a lie?

1428
02:11:10,430 --> 02:11:12,060
Mr. Prakash killed him.

1429
02:11:15,780 --> 02:11:16,980
Mr. Prakash?

1430
02:11:21,400 --> 02:11:25,390
- Where are you going, Raja?
- Home.

1431
02:11:25,740 --> 02:11:27,240
Won't you come with us?

1432
02:11:29,010 --> 02:11:30,210
Let's go.

1433
02:11:33,120 --> 02:11:36,130
How do l explain it to Raja?
l'm getting mad thinking that.

1434
02:11:37,650 --> 02:11:39,610
You've ruined your health
thinking only about that.

1435
02:11:40,400 --> 02:11:43,020
Forget all this.
Take care of your health.

1436
02:11:44,030 --> 02:11:45,430
l won't survive now.

1437
02:11:47,950 --> 02:11:50,000
What pleasure did you get
by marrying me?

1438
02:11:52,860 --> 02:11:54,470
Your pleasure is my pleasure, Malati.

1439
02:11:56,750 --> 02:11:58,550
You're not a human being, but a God.

1440
02:12:00,800 --> 02:12:04,130
You've borne so much unhappiness
for my sake.

1441
02:12:05,460 --> 02:12:08,990
You have borne all the insults
meted out to you just for my sake.

1442
02:12:10,290 --> 02:12:11,590
And now Raja!

1443
02:12:20,490 --> 02:12:22,120
Forget the past, Malati.

1444
02:12:23,900 --> 02:12:30,080
You wipe away my tears,
but l can't do anything for you.

1445
02:12:31,160 --> 02:12:35,180
Nothing. l've only given you unhappiness.

1446
02:12:36,080 --> 02:12:37,980
You get well and that will make me happy.

1447
02:12:39,450 --> 02:12:42,080
Don't cry like this.
You'll recover very soon.

1448
02:12:43,570 --> 02:12:44,870
Take the medicine.

1449
02:12:48,670 --> 02:12:50,370
This isn't medicine but tastes like poison.

1450
02:12:50,390 --> 02:12:51,590
Take this.

1451
02:12:53,270 --> 02:12:56,610
- Why are you giving my mother poison?
- No, son, it's medicine.

1452
02:12:57,500 --> 02:13:00,380
- Mother don't drink. lt's poison.
- No, son.

1453
02:13:01,190 --> 02:13:05,260
Papa is dead and you'll die too.
He killed my papa too.

1454
02:13:06,090 --> 02:13:09,270
- Raja!
- Papa is dead and will never come.

1455
02:13:09,720 --> 02:13:11,770
Let's go to our house, mama, come.

1456
02:13:12,090 --> 02:13:14,530
- We won't stay here.
- No son, don't talk like that.

1457
02:13:14,660 --> 02:13:17,690
- You don't talk to me. Come mama.
- Raja.

1458
02:13:18,350 --> 02:13:23,710
- Son, this is our house.
- No, this isn't our house.

1459
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:27,480
This is his house,
or else he'll kill you too.

1460
02:13:27,510 --> 02:13:28,610
Raja!

1461
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:33,100
Malati!

1462
02:13:50,390 --> 02:13:53,410
- Doctor?
- The case is getting to be more serious.

1463
02:14:53,700 --> 02:14:56,060
Ma.

1464
02:14:56,300 --> 02:14:57,710
Ma.

1465
02:15:01,610 --> 02:15:03,560
Raja!

1466
02:15:03,820 --> 02:15:05,710
What happened?

1467
02:15:05,730 --> 02:15:13,780
- Where is my mama?
- What happened to you, son?

1468
02:15:13,860 --> 02:15:18,940
- Where's my mama?
- She's gone to the hospital.

1469
02:15:18,990 --> 02:15:21,290
No, she's dead.

1470
02:15:21,560 --> 02:15:23,670
Papa also went to the hospital
and never came back.

1471
02:15:23,870 --> 02:15:25,470
She won't come back. She's dead.

1472
02:15:27,190 --> 02:15:30,140
No, son. She'll surely return.

1473
02:15:30,310 --> 02:15:33,050
No, she won't come.

1474
02:15:33,110 --> 02:15:37,000
- My dear child!
- No, mama.

1475
02:15:39,130 --> 02:15:40,430
My darling child!

1476
02:15:42,310 --> 02:15:44,720
No, dear.

1477
02:15:45,060 --> 02:15:47,480
See, your mother will come
from the hospital.

1478
02:15:47,940 --> 02:15:49,730
See, my darling child should never cry.

1479
02:15:50,180 --> 02:15:52,620
Close your eyes and sleep.

1480
02:15:52,650 --> 02:15:56,420
My dear child!

1481
02:15:57,380 --> 02:16:00,410
Sleep, my child.

1482
02:16:00,600 --> 02:16:02,100
My child, go to sleep.

1483
02:16:02,810 --> 02:16:05,600
'Raja, go to sleep.'

1484
02:16:05,760 --> 02:16:07,090
'Go to sleep.'

1485
02:16:07,670 --> 02:16:14,790
'Your eyes are getting sleepy.'

1486
02:16:15,110 --> 02:16:17,610
'Child, go to sleep.'

1487
02:16:34,730 --> 02:16:36,230
- Has Raja slept?
- Yes, sir.

1488
02:16:37,260 --> 02:16:40,910
He was disturbed by not having
his mother by his side.

1489
02:16:41,639 --> 02:16:44,749
- Take him to his mother at the hospital tomorrow.
- Okay.

1490
02:17:27,620 --> 02:17:30,600
- What happened, Raja?
- ls my father in the hospital?

1491
02:17:33,150 --> 02:17:34,850
- Yes, son.
- And mother too?

1492
02:17:35,870 --> 02:17:38,470
- Yes, son.
- You killed my father.

1493
02:17:38,770 --> 02:17:41,810
You also killed my mama.
l'll kill you.

1494
02:17:42,059 --> 02:17:43,359
l'll kill you.

1495
02:17:45,389 --> 02:17:47,799
Your mama is fine
and in the hospital, son.

1496
02:17:48,020 --> 02:17:52,500
You're a liar. She's dead and
you killed her. l'll kill you.

1497
02:17:52,520 --> 02:17:55,160
Raja!

1498
02:17:55,260 --> 02:18:00,100
- Let go of me!
- Shobha! - Let go of me!

1499
02:18:00,129 --> 02:18:03,989
- My dear. - Take him away!
- Let go of me!

1500
02:18:04,180 --> 02:18:07,370
Let go of me!

1501
02:18:53,750 --> 02:18:56,380
Brother, Mr. Prakash has killed mama.

1502
02:18:56,700 --> 02:18:59,060
He'll kill you and me too.

1503
02:18:59,480 --> 02:19:00,880
Come, let's run away.

1504
02:20:01,910 --> 02:20:07,690
Brother, do you know that when
people die they go far away.

1505
02:20:10,410 --> 02:20:12,880
Our father is also dead
and has gone far away.

1506
02:20:14,450 --> 02:20:16,030
Let's go to him.

1507
02:20:18,730 --> 02:20:20,130
But how to go?

1508
02:20:30,450 --> 02:20:33,730
lf we go by train,
we'll get there fast.

1509
02:21:01,430 --> 02:21:02,530
Raja!

1510
02:21:05,290 --> 02:21:06,390
Munna.

1511
02:21:08,390 --> 02:21:12,890
- Pyare!
- Why are you shouting?

1512
02:21:12,910 --> 02:21:14,510
Raja and the child are missing.

1513
02:21:14,530 --> 02:21:15,930
- What? - What happened? - Missing?

1514
02:21:15,950 --> 02:21:17,750
She says Raja and the child are missing.

1515
02:21:17,770 --> 02:21:19,670
- Where can they be?
- l searched the whole house.

1516
02:21:34,950 --> 02:21:37,730
- Madam! Madam Raja.
- What happened to Raja?

1517
02:21:37,760 --> 02:21:39,660
Raja has run away
taking the child with him.

1518
02:21:39,950 --> 02:21:41,720
- Raja!
- No.

1519
02:21:42,100 --> 02:21:43,200
Raja!

1520
02:22:06,910 --> 02:22:09,070
Dear brother.

1521
02:22:09,380 --> 02:22:10,950
Quiet.

1522
02:22:13,400 --> 02:22:14,700
Are you hungry?

1523
02:22:15,240 --> 02:22:16,840
Where can l get some milk?

1524
02:22:20,670 --> 02:22:22,570
Will you drink water?
Shall l get some water?

1525
02:22:22,590 --> 02:22:25,890
l'll get water. Don't cry. Quiet.

1526
02:22:27,130 --> 02:22:29,940
- Did you find anything, Pyare?
- They're not over here.

1527
02:22:30,750 --> 02:22:32,400
- Let's look there.
- Let's go. - Tiger!

1528
02:23:02,930 --> 02:23:04,030
Brother!

1529
02:24:02,150 --> 02:24:04,610
- Brother!
- Raja!

1530
02:24:06,750 --> 02:24:07,850
Raja!

1531
02:25:08,680 --> 02:25:12,570
- Pyare, l won't be able to see it.
- Let's go.

1532
02:25:17,420 --> 02:25:18,520
Pyare!

1533
02:25:21,480 --> 02:25:22,580
Child!

1534
02:25:26,220 --> 02:25:29,270
- He's safe!
- Thank God!

1535
02:25:29,750 --> 02:25:31,150
What happened to him?

1536
02:25:31,170 --> 02:25:33,810
He saw the child
under the train and fainted.

1537
02:25:35,210 --> 02:25:36,510
Let's go home.

1538
02:25:47,150 --> 02:25:51,680
Brother!

1539
02:25:53,200 --> 02:25:56,020
l didn't kill the brother.

1540
02:25:56,270 --> 02:25:58,070
- You didn't son.
- l didn't kill the brother.

1541
02:25:58,090 --> 02:25:59,490
See there, he's fine.

1542
02:26:01,310 --> 02:26:02,410
Brother!

1543
02:26:05,120 --> 02:26:06,220
Mama!

1544
02:26:07,720 --> 02:26:09,220
- Mama!
- Move aside.

1545
02:26:10,720 --> 02:26:17,460
l'm alive but you won't let me live.
You will take my life.

1546
02:26:18,440 --> 02:26:20,260
- Mama!
- Don't address me as mother.

1547
02:26:21,960 --> 02:26:25,200
He treated you like your own father...

1548
02:26:25,260 --> 02:26:27,040
and kept you close to his heart.

1549
02:26:28,390 --> 02:26:30,190
He thought all your happiness
was his happiness.

1550
02:26:31,160 --> 02:26:32,760
And you dared to shoot him?

1551
02:26:33,350 --> 02:26:34,920
You think he's your enemy?

1552
02:26:35,370 --> 02:26:37,470
Don't blame Raja. lt was my mistake.

1553
02:26:39,020 --> 02:26:41,780
But many questions came before me.

1554
02:26:42,350 --> 02:26:46,280
The situation at that time,
your honor and my duty.

1555
02:26:47,390 --> 02:26:51,360
More important than that
was Raja's future.

1556
02:26:52,990 --> 02:26:57,120
Then l thought that if a woman
can marry a man with a child...

1557
02:26:57,750 --> 02:26:59,950
then why is it wrong
for a man to do the same?

1558
02:27:01,160 --> 02:27:06,870
Malati, when l married you
and also adopted Raja then...

1559
02:27:08,200 --> 02:27:11,280
l didn't know that the blood
relation was stronger than...

1560
02:27:11,300 --> 02:27:13,030
the relationship built on love.

1561
02:27:14,930 --> 02:27:18,430
But now l know the blood
relationship is what's real.

1562
02:27:20,640 --> 02:27:21,740
Raja.

1563
02:27:24,800 --> 02:27:26,300
l didn't kill your father.

1564
02:27:27,140 --> 02:27:29,240
lnstead, l killed myself
and made your father live.

1565
02:27:30,700 --> 02:27:33,390
l wanted to fill
the biggest void in your life.

1566
02:27:34,640 --> 02:27:38,560
But you proved that Amar
is forever alive for you.

1567
02:27:39,960 --> 02:27:42,300
l told you the lie that
your father was in the hospital.

1568
02:27:43,270 --> 02:27:45,970
l didn't want to tell you
he was dead and make you feel sad.

1569
02:27:46,530 --> 02:27:49,260
What's this that you're saying?

1570
02:27:49,720 --> 02:27:53,640
Malati, l made Raja my son
and was very happy.

1571
02:27:54,940 --> 02:27:56,640
But l could never make Raja happy.

1572
02:27:57,630 --> 02:27:59,330
He was always sad because of me.

1573
02:28:00,680 --> 02:28:03,320
l don't want him to do anything
dangerous again because of me.

1574
02:28:04,520 --> 02:28:06,950
Hence, it's better that l leave here.

1575
02:28:09,370 --> 02:28:12,550
This is your house and
this is Raja's house.

1576
02:28:13,610 --> 02:28:15,810
Both of you be happy here
and that is my wish.

1577
02:28:20,490 --> 02:28:25,150
- Where are you going?
- Far away from Raja's sight.

1578
02:28:27,510 --> 02:28:30,600
To be with some other
step-father like me.

1579
02:28:31,920 --> 02:28:36,540
A step-father can always
accept his step-son as son.

1580
02:28:37,960 --> 02:28:40,290
But the step-son never accepts
the step-father as his father.

1581
02:28:41,500 --> 02:28:43,540
lt'll be better if l leave here.

1582
02:28:44,700 --> 02:28:46,840
This is the only way to make Raja happy.

1583
02:28:52,220 --> 02:28:57,560
Malati, l brought you and Raja
here one day for Raja's happiness.

1584
02:29:00,170 --> 02:29:02,240
Today also l'm leaving this place
for Raja's happiness.

1585
02:29:03,670 --> 02:29:08,440
Believe me Malati, l may not
be Raja's but Raja is mine.

1586
02:29:09,770 --> 02:29:11,170
Raja is my son.

1587
02:29:19,880 --> 02:29:20,980
Papa!

1588
02:29:21,880 --> 02:29:23,180
Don't go, papa.

1589
02:29:23,700 --> 02:29:25,000
Don't go, papa.

1590
02:29:25,680 --> 02:29:26,780
Son!

1591
02:29:26,930 --> 02:29:29,880
- Son!
- Papa! - Son!

1592
02:29:34,930 --> 02:29:39,330
Raja has got a father.
Malati has got a husband.

1593
02:29:40,480 --> 02:29:45,070
Prakash has shown the world
that for the three of them...

1594
02:29:45,560 --> 02:29:47,390
this was the only way.

1595
02:29:48,110 --> 02:29:49,410
The only way.

1596
02:29:53,650 --> 02:29:57,350
The days of merry making
have come once again

1597
02:29:57,540 --> 02:30:01,470
The surroundings are swaying
all colorful  and bright

1598
02:30:01,650 --> 02:30:05,270
On the banks of the river
the cuckoo is calling

1599
02:30:05,550 --> 02:30:09,420
The whole world has
sown the seeds of love

1600
02:30:13,060 --> 02:30:16,660
The days of merry making
have come once again

1601
02:30:16,910 --> 02:30:20,830
The surroundings are swaying
all colorful  and bright

1602
02:30:21,060 --> 02:30:24,670
On the banks of the river
the cuckoo is calling

1603
02:30:24,940 --> 02:30:28,910
The whole world has
sown the seeds of love
