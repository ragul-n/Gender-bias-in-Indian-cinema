1
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:23,971
Go away. I'm telling you, go away.

2
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:30,151
Nothing will happen to me.
Boss Veeru, go from here.

3
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:32,004
He's my brother

4
00:02:32,851 --> 00:02:34,687
He won't hurt me. Go!

5
00:02:49,651 --> 00:02:52,235
Hey, tell me where it is
Tell me.

6
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,511
Seach him.
Give it.

7
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:55,479
Search him completely.
Take it out.

8
00:02:56,457 --> 00:02:58,063
Where is it?
Give it to me.

9
00:02:58,657 --> 00:02:59,921
Search him.

10
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:01,264
Check him thoroughly.

11
00:03:01,384 --> 00:03:04,089
Open your mouth.
Tell us where it is.

12
00:03:14,686 --> 00:03:15,874
No.

13
00:03:41,106 --> 00:03:43,745
Hey, where is it?

14
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,561
I don't know, Shaka.

15
00:03:51,146 --> 00:03:52,429
You don't know?

16
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,157
I really don't know.

17
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:59,699
You don't know? No?

18
00:04:00,215 --> 00:04:01,887
Tell me! You don't know?

19
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,300
I am your brother.

20
00:04:09,037 --> 00:04:10,224
Tell me.

21
00:04:11,082 --> 00:04:12,215
Tell me.

22
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,898
I don't know.
I don't know anything.

23
00:04:15,018 --> 00:04:16,471
You don't know?

24
00:04:20,896 --> 00:04:22,260
Tell me!

25
00:04:23,238 --> 00:04:25,042
I will give you 10 chances

26
00:04:25,823 --> 00:04:28,814
Come on, tell me.

27
00:04:37,728 --> 00:04:39,652
Tell me soon. 1..

28
00:04:40,301 --> 00:04:41,434
Tell me!

29
00:04:47,348 --> 00:04:48,525
Tell me.

30
00:04:50,064 --> 00:04:51,307
2..

31
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:55,552
3..

32
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,671
I'm telling you, tell me.
Tell me soon.

33
00:05:00,815 --> 00:05:02,134
4..

34
00:05:03,091 --> 00:05:05,818
Tell me now. 5!

35
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:11,042
I'm asking you for the last time.
Tell me.

36
00:06:42,299 --> 00:06:44,348
I want to know where it is

37
00:06:45,602 --> 00:06:47,493
I need to know

38
00:06:47,746 --> 00:06:50,045
I know he is not dead

39
00:06:50,165 --> 00:06:51,848
He can't die yet

40
00:06:52,376 --> 00:06:54,586
I want that Veeru bastard

41
00:06:56,192 --> 00:06:59,128
Hurry up. Go and find him.

42
00:08:23,817 --> 00:08:25,016
Cmon. Cmon. Quick.

43
00:08:25,136 --> 00:08:27,479
Be careful. This box contains lakhs of cash
and gold coins

44
00:09:17,196 --> 00:09:18,527
Come on, hurry up.

45
00:09:19,296 --> 00:09:23,022
Hey, help me up.
- No. Get up yourself.

46
00:09:44,037 --> 00:09:45,774
Why hasn't Raja come?

47
00:09:46,258 --> 00:09:49,752
I thought I found the right guy after all this time
and told him about the plan.

48
00:09:51,434 --> 00:09:53,249
The train left with the treasure box.

49
00:09:53,623 --> 00:09:54,745
And he didn't show up.

50
00:11:09,573 --> 00:11:11,255
It's time for practice.

51
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,809
You can't shoot something
right infront of you

52
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,222
And he wants to practice.
Such a waste of bullets.

53
00:11:23,223 --> 00:11:24,100
Useless fellow

54
00:11:30,361 --> 00:11:32,248
You should start a gun shooting school.

55
00:11:38,528 --> 00:11:40,485
We are taking this cash
to our new branch.

56
00:11:40,605 --> 00:11:42,619
Guard it carefully. - Okay, sir.

57
00:11:48,818 --> 00:11:50,731
Everyone up.
Shoot him.

58
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,468
I think he is dacoit.
Shoot him.

59
00:12:08,704 --> 00:12:10,089
Idiot!

60
00:12:23,373 --> 00:12:25,104
Where is he?
Did we lose him?

61
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:10,714
Shoot him, come on.

62
00:13:13,023 --> 00:13:14,332
Catch him.

63
00:13:25,168 --> 00:13:26,535
Where did he go? Find him.

64
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,182
Sir, he is our man.

65
00:15:42,534 --> 00:15:43,458
I'll kill you!

66
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:55,816
Here's your share.

67
00:15:59,034 --> 00:16:00,530
I don't know who you are..

68
00:16:01,304 --> 00:16:04,398
..but you gave the information
to me on the right time.

69
00:16:04,322 --> 00:16:07,816
I'm set for a month now.

70
00:16:07,817 --> 00:16:09,922
I got tensed when you
didn't come on time.

71
00:16:10,042 --> 00:16:11,365
But you did it.
- Oh no.

72
00:16:11,734 --> 00:16:14,277
No build up just business

73
00:16:15,271 --> 00:16:16,767
If you keep me informed..

74
00:16:17,031 --> 00:16:18,605
..then I will make you rich.

75
00:16:25,536 --> 00:16:26,609
One thousand?

76
00:16:27,463 --> 00:16:29,504
Chi!

77
00:16:48,732 --> 00:16:49,533
Hands up!

78
00:17:08,573 --> 00:17:09,893
Give it to me.

79
00:24:15,244 --> 00:24:17,620
Who is it?
- The mermaid is out of water.

80
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,186
She is bathing here.
- Who are you?

81
00:24:19,705 --> 00:24:22,467
What do you want? - Don't worry.
We will not do anything.

82
00:24:22,587 --> 00:24:25,019
She is blind. She won't be
able to tell anyone.

83
00:24:25,139 --> 00:24:27,202
Help me. What are you doing?

84
00:24:29,005 --> 00:24:31,680
Somebody help me.
- Don't bother biting and screaming

85
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,272
We won't hurt you at all

86
00:24:33,392 --> 00:24:36,299
We will have a small rape session
and leave from here. Okay?

87
00:24:36,547 --> 00:24:37,963
Help!
- Boys!

88
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:40,770
Take her belongings.
- Please.

89
00:24:41,166 --> 00:24:42,855
Please don't hurt me.

90
00:24:44,386 --> 00:24:46,972
Oh, he has two pistols.
Run!

91
00:24:47,092 --> 00:24:49,000
Run!

92
00:24:57,426 --> 00:24:58,473
Who is it?

93
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:00,752
Who are you?
- Don't get scared.

94
00:25:01,306 --> 00:25:03,813
But you.. they ran away.

95
00:25:05,291 --> 00:25:07,069
Thanks for saving my life.

96
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,273
You are welcome.

97
00:25:08,705 --> 00:25:11,777
Where are you headed all
alone in the jungle?

98
00:25:11,995 --> 00:25:14,661
I'm blind since I was a child.

99
00:25:14,662 --> 00:25:20,281
But my horse knows all routes around here and takes me places
So I was confident

100
00:25:20,282 --> 00:25:22,138
I was heading over to my grandfather's place

101
00:25:22,613 --> 00:25:24,267
These goons stopped me on the way.

102
00:25:24,387 --> 00:25:25,648
Don't get scared.

103
00:25:25,868 --> 00:25:27,619
They ran away.
You can go now.

104
00:25:27,739 --> 00:25:29,933
But how do I go?
I lost my horse.

105
00:25:30,348 --> 00:25:32,460
What if they return again?

106
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,351
I told you not to worry.
I'm here.

107
00:25:34,813 --> 00:25:36,936
I will drop you home. Come.

108
00:25:38,959 --> 00:25:40,136
Careful.

109
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:48,166
I'm a little thirsty. Can you get me some water please?

110
00:26:17,167 --> 00:26:18,355
Hey!

111
00:26:22,108 --> 00:26:23,383
What are you doing?

112
00:26:24,131 --> 00:26:27,529
My bag? Isn't this my bag?

113
00:26:28,354 --> 00:26:29,960
Where is my bag?

114
00:26:31,543 --> 00:26:34,017
When I met you,
you didn't have a bag.

115
00:26:34,831 --> 00:26:36,119
Oh my god.

116
00:26:36,757 --> 00:26:38,814
All my money was in it.

117
00:26:40,045 --> 00:26:41,486
What do I do now?

118
00:26:41,761 --> 00:26:44,333
That bag contained my mother's chain
which was her last souvenir.

119
00:26:44,577 --> 00:26:48,040
What do I do now?
Ayooo!

120
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,385
Please, stop crying.

121
00:26:49,505 --> 00:26:52,179
The bag must be around.
I will go and find it.

122
00:26:52,849 --> 00:26:54,158
Thank you.

123
00:26:55,544 --> 00:26:56,731
Here, have water.

124
00:27:00,064 --> 00:27:02,864
Uncle, see how I fooled him.

125
00:27:02,984 --> 00:27:04,712
He totally believed our blind act

126
00:27:05,647 --> 00:27:08,836
All that is okay Palasa. You acted good
but he's not stupid

127
00:27:08,956 --> 00:27:11,838
If he finds out
he will mince us.

128
00:27:11,958 --> 00:27:13,257
Let's go Palasa

129
00:27:30,199 --> 00:27:32,000
You went through
a lot of trouble for me

130
00:27:32,001 --> 00:27:35,115
Keep this coin.
It is for your expenses.

131
00:27:37,621 --> 00:27:40,162
Everyone...drinks are on me.
Show!

132
00:27:40,282 --> 00:27:42,343
Its a show by me.
That's okay

133
00:27:42,344 --> 00:27:45,577
Shuffle again, we'll play again
and I'll lose again

134
00:27:45,578 --> 00:27:48,283
I have a lot of money. Don't worry. Take this.
- Thank you.

135
00:27:48,403 --> 00:27:50,845
Earning money
is very difficult.

136
00:27:50,965 --> 00:27:52,847
You have to work hard daily.

137
00:27:52,967 --> 00:27:56,627
This is not money earned with ease.
It is earned by toiling hard.

138
00:27:56,747 --> 00:27:58,662
It is my hard earned money.

139
00:27:58,782 --> 00:28:01,114
This is my move.
Here.

140
00:28:01,234 --> 00:28:02,587
Show.

141
00:28:02,707 --> 00:28:04,303
I lost again.

142
00:28:04,423 --> 00:28:07,795
No problem.
This is common for me.

143
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:12,885
Sir?

144
00:28:12,886 --> 00:28:15,482
Who is he?
- He? His name is Dubey.

145
00:28:15,602 --> 00:28:16,680
He is a small-time thief.

146
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,089
He used to either beg
or drink on credit

147
00:28:19,396 --> 00:28:21,255
Looks like he got lucky

148
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:23,131
He's splurging a lot

149
00:28:23,527 --> 00:28:25,066
There was a girl with him, right?

150
00:28:25,407 --> 00:28:27,871
Yeah! She's here.
She is his 50% partner in all these crimes

151
00:28:27,991 --> 00:28:29,850
Even she's spending
lot of money these days.

152
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:32,347
She came back from shopping.
She must be in her room.

153
00:30:55,466 --> 00:30:56,555
Who is it?

154
00:30:57,742 --> 00:30:58,875
Who is here?

155
00:30:59,455 --> 00:31:00,775
My towel.

156
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,370
Who is here?
My towel?

157
00:31:23,808 --> 00:31:25,444
Please, I don't know who you are

158
00:31:25,564 --> 00:31:28,546
Don't harm me.
I'm a blind person. Please don't hurt me.

159
00:31:28,666 --> 00:31:30,030
Enough of drama.

160
00:31:30,591 --> 00:31:31,966
Tell me, where's my money?

161
00:31:37,233 --> 00:31:38,469
I won!

162
00:31:38,589 --> 00:31:40,493
I am rich now.

163
00:31:40,613 --> 00:31:43,515
Listen, this is not a child's game.
You need to have skill and technique

164
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:45,284
You need to have talent

165
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:48,873
Cheating is not going to help you.

166
00:31:49,278 --> 00:31:51,389
Don't cry. Drink as much
as you want all night.

167
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:53,008
On me!

168
00:31:59,511 --> 00:32:01,204
What is this?
Where did this spring come from?

169
00:32:03,304 --> 00:32:06,505
I think something's wrong with the drink.
I'll be back after seeing a doctor

170
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:09,188
Palasa, my trick is out

171
00:32:09,308 --> 00:32:11,178
We have to leave now!

172
00:32:21,717 --> 00:32:23,312
What?
Is it a 'kodi' (hen)?

173
00:32:23,872 --> 00:32:25,148
or code?

174
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,490
I'll make you all lay eggs now.

175
00:32:27,864 --> 00:32:29,481
Hey!

176
00:32:29,954 --> 00:32:32,087
Hey, don't move.
- Give me the money. Hurry up.

177
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:36,335
Who are they?
- This Dubey bastard fooled us and took our money.

178
00:32:40,294 --> 00:32:43,901
Darling, why don't you
give this money to them?

179
00:32:46,123 --> 00:32:47,090
I see.

180
00:32:52,622 --> 00:32:54,898
Run!

181
00:33:44,068 --> 00:33:45,849
Keep this coin.
It is for your expenses.

182
00:34:02,089 --> 00:34:03,267
We have to nab Raja.

183
00:34:23,111 --> 00:34:25,046
Listen, why is he shouting at me?

184
00:34:25,166 --> 00:34:26,753
It is staring at my food.

185
00:34:26,873 --> 00:34:29,611
Don't worry about her sir.
She keeps staring at anyone who eats in her plate.

186
00:34:41,776 --> 00:34:43,635
Sir, what will you have?
- One beer.

187
00:34:54,091 --> 00:34:55,569
He is Raja, right?
- Yes.

188
00:34:56,105 --> 00:34:57,874
We can't handle him ourselves.

189
00:34:57,994 --> 00:34:59,992
If we call for backup

190
00:35:00,112 --> 00:35:01,418
They'll nab him,

191
00:35:01,538 --> 00:35:02,693
Yes, yes.

192
00:35:06,001 --> 00:35:07,778
Let's go. - Let's go.

193
00:40:41,399 --> 00:40:42,991
Shoot him!

194
00:40:54,768 --> 00:40:56,079
Catch him!

195
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,707
Attack! Come on!

196
00:41:26,181 --> 00:41:27,475
Shoot him!

197
00:41:33,738 --> 00:41:35,067
My name is Bhuvana.

198
00:41:35,187 --> 00:41:37,658
My father wants to get me
married as soon as possible.

199
00:41:37,778 --> 00:41:40,455
But how can I marry any stranger?

200
00:41:40,922 --> 00:41:43,675
I want to know how would
my future husband be?

201
00:41:43,795 --> 00:41:45,189
Please, tell me.

202
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,700
Keep your hand on this.

203
00:42:06,713 --> 00:42:08,552
He isn't a common man.

204
00:42:08,754 --> 00:42:10,689
He is very fortunate.

205
00:42:10,809 --> 00:42:12,484
He is a well-built male.

206
00:42:12,686 --> 00:42:14,569
He is always above everyone else

207
00:42:16,792 --> 00:42:19,124
Sometimes, he likes to fly

208
00:42:19,244 --> 00:42:20,971
..between land and sky.

209
00:42:33,992 --> 00:42:37,247
Everyone will have to look 'up' to him.

210
00:42:50,646 --> 00:42:52,661
Like the earth rotates around it self

211
00:42:52,781 --> 00:42:55,925
He runs around like a spiralling fireball
killing his enemies.

212
00:44:02,879 --> 00:44:04,330
Are you kidding me?

213
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:07,487
Just because I snuck in here in secret
asking about my future husband

214
00:44:07,488 --> 00:44:10,366
you tell me all this nonsense

215
00:44:10,486 --> 00:44:14,078
Whatever you said, I don't think
anybody like that would exist.

216
00:44:14,544 --> 00:44:15,855
Dear, this is true.

217
00:44:15,975 --> 00:44:19,484
He is a prince.
My prediction never goes wrong.

218
00:44:19,604 --> 00:44:22,365
You see, your husband
will be like this.

219
00:44:22,485 --> 00:44:24,752
I've never predicted wrong.

220
00:44:24,872 --> 00:44:28,117
People don't come to me
just like that.

221
00:44:38,341 --> 00:44:40,430
Do you mean,
he is really a prince?

222
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:43,388
Yes. He will be your husband.

223
00:44:43,685 --> 00:44:46,335
But.. how will I recognize him?

224
00:44:46,455 --> 00:44:47,699
Look for a birthmark

225
00:44:47,819 --> 00:44:50,345
He has a distinct birthmark
- Really?

226
00:44:50,465 --> 00:44:51,840
Where is that spot?

227
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,612
On his upper left thigh.

228
00:44:55,338 --> 00:44:57,669
But how can I see there?

229
00:44:59,945 --> 00:45:01,089
Shall I tell you?

230
00:45:01,209 --> 00:45:04,774
Pull down every guy's pants
as you see them

231
00:45:11,361 --> 00:45:13,835
You surround him from behind
and I will from the front. - Okay.

232
00:45:14,088 --> 00:45:17,178
Hey! Don't move.

233
00:45:18,607 --> 00:45:22,038
Why are you shouting?
Who is moving?

234
00:45:22,158 --> 00:45:23,468
Give us our stuff.

235
00:45:23,677 --> 00:45:25,195
Whatever you stole,
return us everything.

236
00:45:25,315 --> 00:45:26,976
Shoot this idiot.

237
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:09,065
Hey, this is my fan.
Give that to me.

238
00:46:09,505 --> 00:46:10,769
Give.

239
00:46:14,651 --> 00:46:17,324
Give me or I'll complaint
it to my father.

240
00:46:19,871 --> 00:46:21,597
Leave it!

241
00:46:22,994 --> 00:46:24,731
Hey! Leave it!

242
00:46:54,709 --> 00:46:57,030
Wait right here.

243
00:47:10,179 --> 00:47:12,812
Why don't go check if one of those two
have that birthmark

244
00:49:43,325 --> 00:49:44,996
Hey

245
00:49:48,043 --> 00:49:51,606
Have you seen any
thin and tall man

246
00:49:51,726 --> 00:49:54,289
with a bugle on his forehead
around here?

247
00:49:54,409 --> 00:49:56,984
..around 50 years old

248
00:49:57,104 --> 00:49:59,403
Thin and tall?
I don't think I saw any such person

249
00:50:04,562 --> 00:50:07,861
Shaka, we've been looking
for him since 18 years.

250
00:50:08,235 --> 00:50:10,435
I think he would've
been dead by now.

251
00:50:11,138 --> 00:50:13,932
No! He is not dead.

252
00:50:15,273 --> 00:50:17,243
If he was dead, we would've
found his corpse.

253
00:50:18,222 --> 00:50:19,850
He is still alive.

254
00:50:20,301 --> 00:50:21,411
He is alive.

255
00:50:22,159 --> 00:50:24,391
Search the entire village.

256
00:50:29,589 --> 00:50:31,117
You have a diamond?

257
00:50:31,601 --> 00:50:33,943
This must be very expensive.
Where did you find it?

258
00:50:34,063 --> 00:50:37,045
You need not know that.
Keep this diamond and do my work.

259
00:50:37,165 --> 00:50:40,729
What do I have to do? Theft,
kidnapping, or jail break? - No.

260
00:50:40,849 --> 00:50:42,884
You have to take
a girl to Palasapadu.

261
00:50:43,598 --> 00:50:44,566
Me?

262
00:50:46,370 --> 00:50:48,019
Who do you think I am?

263
00:50:48,139 --> 00:50:50,889
Do do look like someone who
ferries people around?

264
00:50:51,009 --> 00:50:53,243
She can take a train
or ride a horse.

265
00:50:53,363 --> 00:50:54,738
Train doesn't go to Manikpur.

266
00:50:54,858 --> 00:50:57,633
You have to reach there by crossing
mountains, jungle, and rivers.

267
00:50:57,753 --> 00:50:59,789
Its a very dangerous journey

268
00:50:59,909 --> 00:51:03,011
Its going to be hard to take her
there safely

269
00:51:03,131 --> 00:51:04,935
That's why I'm asking you for help

270
00:51:05,055 --> 00:51:06,981
Okay, who is that girl?

271
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:09,957
My daughter.

272
00:51:13,201 --> 00:51:14,576
You are a secretive man

273
00:51:15,148 --> 00:51:18,645
First diamond, then girl,
what else have you hidden?

274
00:51:19,184 --> 00:51:21,327
Okay, tell your daughter
to be ready tomorrow.

275
00:51:21,447 --> 00:51:22,558
I will come tomorrow morning.

276
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:25,440
Not tomorrow,
but you have to leave today....in an hour

277
00:51:27,287 --> 00:51:30,817
Why are you sending me so far
from you suddenly?

278
00:51:31,972 --> 00:51:35,714
Nothing, dear. Your uncle has work
and he has called you urgently.

279
00:51:35,834 --> 00:51:37,100
Or why would he ask for you?

280
00:51:38,255 --> 00:51:40,355
Okay, I'll go.

281
00:51:42,555 --> 00:51:43,874
Come on, let's go.

282
00:51:49,892 --> 00:51:51,058
Get ready soon.

283
00:51:51,267 --> 00:51:53,543
The one who's coming along
with you will be here anytime.

284
00:51:55,787 --> 00:51:57,656
Why is a guy coming to take me?

285
00:51:57,776 --> 00:52:00,317
Am I a kid?
I can go by myself.

286
00:52:00,437 --> 00:52:02,795
Dear, listen to me.
You have to travel for a week.

287
00:52:02,915 --> 00:52:04,027
The road is dangerous.

288
00:52:04,147 --> 00:52:05,764
It is important for someone
to be with you.

289
00:52:05,884 --> 00:52:06,941
Please agree, dear.

290
00:52:07,061 --> 00:52:08,921
Okay, as you wish.
- Yes.

291
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:11,648
Look there, Raja is here.

292
00:52:23,324 --> 00:52:25,403
Hey, birthmark gal

293
00:52:27,315 --> 00:52:30,020
You? Thief, rascal, scoundrel..

294
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:32,725
..rowdy, idiot, goon, loafer.

295
00:52:33,825 --> 00:52:36,728
You can abuse me later,
first tell me something.

296
00:52:37,564 --> 00:52:39,258
Did you find the guy
who has the spot?

297
00:52:39,378 --> 00:52:40,464
Oh, shut up!

298
00:52:40,584 --> 00:52:43,169
Dad, I will not go with this guy.

299
00:52:43,289 --> 00:52:46,226
Then who will you go with?
The one who has a spot?

300
00:52:46,346 --> 00:52:48,723
Don't talk interfere
in my personal matter.

301
00:52:48,843 --> 00:52:49,723
What is this, dear?

302
00:52:49,843 --> 00:52:51,461
Stop arguing like a kid.

303
00:52:51,581 --> 00:52:53,099
But dad, he..
- Enough, stay quiet.

304
00:52:53,219 --> 00:52:54,498
I trust him completely.

305
00:52:54,618 --> 00:52:56,873
If you respect me, go with him.

306
00:52:58,182 --> 00:52:59,952
Sigh..I will go

307
00:53:00,601 --> 00:53:04,472
Look Raja, she lost her mother
in childhood.

308
00:53:04,901 --> 00:53:06,737
My leniency has spoilt her.

309
00:53:07,245 --> 00:53:09,246
You don't mind her words.

310
00:53:09,366 --> 00:53:11,292
Just take her safely to my brother.

311
00:53:11,412 --> 00:53:12,732
My daughter is my life.

312
00:53:12,852 --> 00:53:15,261
You don't worry.
I will take her safely.

313
00:53:15,381 --> 00:53:17,362
I know, I trust you.

314
00:53:20,756 --> 00:53:22,988
Okay, dad. I'm leaving.
- Dear, you forgot this.

315
00:53:23,846 --> 00:53:25,242
Be careful. - Okay.

316
00:53:26,177 --> 00:53:29,476
Listen, do you want to sit in front
or at the back?

317
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:31,324
I'll come sit on your head

318
00:53:31,444 --> 00:53:32,808
I can ride my own horse.

319
00:53:32,928 --> 00:53:35,027
As your wish birthmark gal

320
00:53:35,147 --> 00:53:37,271
Shut up. My name is Bhuvana.

321
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:45,716
What is it? Do you
want to come along?

322
00:53:45,836 --> 00:53:48,749
What is this?
I already have enough luggage to carry.

323
00:54:04,469 --> 00:54:06,295
Tell me, what do you see?

324
00:54:06,415 --> 00:54:08,538
He is taking a girl with him.

325
00:54:09,088 --> 00:54:10,991
Come on, let's follow him.

326
00:54:11,111 --> 00:54:13,619
We'll kill him when we
get a chance. - Yes.

327
00:54:13,739 --> 00:54:15,005
Okay? - Done.

328
00:54:15,291 --> 00:54:16,479
Let's go.

329
00:54:17,875 --> 00:54:18,932
Are you blind?
- Sorry, sorry.

330
00:54:19,052 --> 00:54:21,163
Stop staring at me and
show me your cards.

331
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:23,044
Tina, come. - Sure.

332
00:54:23,164 --> 00:54:25,276
What happened,
where are you taking me?

333
00:54:25,396 --> 00:54:28,655
I was this close to stealing
all their money and you pulled me out

334
00:54:28,775 --> 00:54:31,492
Stop worrying about pocket change
Raja is leaving the village.

335
00:54:31,612 --> 00:54:33,285
He usually takes up only
high stakes jobs.

336
00:54:33,405 --> 00:54:35,924
We will follow him.
We will become rich.

337
00:54:36,044 --> 00:54:37,706
He will return.

338
00:54:37,826 --> 00:54:40,216
Who knows if he'll ever return. He's taking
a beautiful girl with him.

339
00:54:40,336 --> 00:54:42,779
If he settles with her,
we'll become beggars.

340
00:54:42,899 --> 00:54:44,934
A girl?

341
00:56:03,631 --> 00:56:06,688
Listen, won't we stop somewhere?

342
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:08,393
I'm talking to you.

343
00:56:08,513 --> 00:56:11,142
I want to rest for some time.
- We'll stop after we get a little further

344
00:56:11,262 --> 00:56:13,542
Thanks for feeling my pain

345
00:56:13,662 --> 00:56:15,412
It is not so that you can rest

346
00:56:15,730 --> 00:56:17,611
..I am worried about your horse

347
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:20,305
Look, if you trouble me like this..

348
00:56:20,425 --> 00:56:22,681
..then I will get red with anger.
- It is good.

349
00:56:22,801 --> 00:56:24,660
It'll start getting cold soon

350
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:27,070
Your rage will keep you warm
in the evening.

351
00:56:39,182 --> 00:56:41,712
This dress.. Horse, move.

352
00:56:47,144 --> 00:56:48,563
Oh no.

353
00:56:53,448 --> 00:56:55,735
Look at him, useless guy.

354
00:57:00,464 --> 00:57:03,466
Listen, can't you help me
light a fire?

355
00:57:09,418 --> 00:57:11,893
Don't know why dad sent
me with this idiot.

356
00:57:12,013 --> 00:57:13,960
I have to endure him
for one week.

357
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:15,632
Stop blabbering.

358
00:57:15,851 --> 00:57:18,742
My job is to take you
to your uncle safely.

359
00:57:19,578 --> 00:57:21,678
I am not here to serve you.

360
00:57:21,798 --> 00:57:23,339
Okay, you sit here.
I will do it myself.

361
00:57:23,459 --> 00:57:24,824
You don't know me.

362
00:57:24,944 --> 00:57:27,034
I am very brave and do my own work

363
00:57:27,903 --> 00:57:30,014
Talking to him is futile.

364
00:57:30,134 --> 00:57:31,262
He's out to get me killed.

365
00:57:52,590 --> 00:57:56,010
Come.. Aww, so sweet.

366
00:57:56,972 --> 00:57:58,973
A cub.

367
00:58:00,557 --> 00:58:02,129
Okay, okay.

368
00:58:05,274 --> 00:58:07,672
Now do you believe
I'm a brave girl.

369
00:58:07,792 --> 00:58:09,519
Hope you get it now

370
00:58:10,118 --> 00:58:11,272
Okay, okay.

371
00:58:14,703 --> 00:58:16,287
What are you doing?

372
00:58:18,211 --> 00:58:19,773
Don't bite me.

373
00:58:20,631 --> 00:58:22,709
Okay, go now.

374
00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:24,508
Go. We'll meet tomorrow.

375
00:58:51,618 --> 00:58:52,949
Oh my God.

376
00:58:57,754 --> 00:58:59,107
What now?

377
00:59:00,669 --> 00:59:01,856
What will we do?

378
00:59:24,830 --> 00:59:25,974
Did it go away?

379
00:59:27,184 --> 00:59:28,778
What if it returns?

380
00:59:32,553 --> 00:59:33,740
Wait, I'm coming.

381
00:59:34,884 --> 00:59:36,940
No animal will come near
if there's fire.

382
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:39,074
Yes, but poisonous snakes can.

383
00:59:39,194 --> 00:59:41,504
No one is scared of snakes here.
Hit them with a stick and they'll die instantly

384
00:59:41,725 --> 00:59:43,143
You think its so easy?

385
00:59:43,263 --> 00:59:45,541
There are no water snakes here...
You'll find

386
00:59:45,661 --> 00:59:48,323
Cobra, python, vipers lurking around
- Why are you telling this to me?

387
00:59:48,443 --> 00:59:51,424
Because, the way you
kissed the lion cub..

388
00:59:51,544 --> 00:59:53,008
..if you kiss the snake..

389
00:59:53,128 --> 00:59:55,826
..then you'll get bit
and start dancing like a Nagini

390
01:00:02,909 --> 01:00:04,206
Good morning.

391
01:00:07,867 --> 01:00:09,637
Sorry, bad morning.

392
01:00:10,099 --> 01:00:12,178
No. No.

393
01:00:13,145 --> 01:00:15,180
Hey, didn't I tell you?

394
01:00:15,554 --> 01:00:17,808
He will take the gun
as soon as he wakes up?

395
01:00:17,928 --> 01:00:19,139
He did exactly that

396
01:00:19,259 --> 01:00:21,701
That's why I
placed a stick instead of a gun.

397
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:26,069
Hey, I'll give you exactly three chances

398
01:00:26,189 --> 01:00:27,444
Tell me.

399
01:00:29,094 --> 01:00:31,590
Hey, get up.

400
01:00:35,268 --> 01:00:36,324
Hands up.

401
01:00:37,072 --> 01:00:39,040
Hands up.

402
01:00:39,524 --> 01:00:42,208
Who are they? Are they thieves?
Can you not read their faces

403
01:00:42,328 --> 01:00:43,868
total loafers

404
01:00:44,429 --> 01:00:47,938
I think, one of them must be
your prince with the spot.

405
01:00:48,058 --> 01:00:49,092
Shut up.

406
01:00:49,521 --> 01:00:50,830
Don't talk about this.

407
01:00:50,950 --> 01:00:52,402
What did she say?
Which topic?

408
01:00:52,522 --> 01:00:54,206
Money topic? Tell me
- I will tell you.

409
01:00:54,326 --> 01:00:56,097
If you have a birth mark on your thigh
- If I do?

410
01:00:56,306 --> 01:00:59,375
Then you are going to get
money, wealth, and a beautiful girl.

411
01:00:59,495 --> 01:01:00,617
Are you telling the truth?

412
01:01:00,912 --> 01:01:03,276
I had a spot in childhood, but
I don't know if it is still there.

413
01:01:03,396 --> 01:01:04,948
Then check it now. - Okay.

414
01:01:05,618 --> 01:01:08,082
Hey, there's no money in here.

415
01:01:09,258 --> 01:01:11,051
Don't move.

416
01:01:12,107 --> 01:01:13,668
What are you saying?

417
01:01:32,707 --> 01:01:33,917
Good Shot!

418
01:01:36,325 --> 01:01:37,832
Take more stones.

419
01:01:37,952 --> 01:01:39,173
Break his head.

420
01:01:39,412 --> 01:01:40,523
Take this.

421
01:01:40,753 --> 01:01:42,348
Come on, do it.

422
01:01:45,229 --> 01:01:46,538
Yes!

423
01:01:46,658 --> 01:01:48,429
How did you do that?

424
01:01:49,375 --> 01:01:51,388
Where did you get the
slingshot from? Tell me.

425
01:01:51,508 --> 01:01:53,081
Tell me.
Where did you get it from?

426
01:01:54,312 --> 01:01:56,457
Your sling shots were faster than
their guns

427
01:01:56,577 --> 01:01:58,172
Tell me, how did you make it?

428
01:01:58,414 --> 01:01:59,646
Please.

429
01:02:03,891 --> 01:02:05,078
This is yours

430
01:02:12,916 --> 01:02:14,741
You! I won't spare you.

431
01:02:26,267 --> 01:02:27,455
Look there.

432
01:02:30,457 --> 01:02:32,194
I think there had stopped here.

433
01:02:32,991 --> 01:02:35,564
I can tell when they left here
just by the warmth of the fire

434
01:02:35,684 --> 01:02:36,950
in just one second

435
01:02:36,951 --> 01:02:39,185
Just now.
They left just now.

436
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:55,341
Oh, lady body.

437
01:02:55,550 --> 01:02:56,991
It must be hers.

438
01:02:57,497 --> 01:02:59,146
Something that must underneath

439
01:02:59,266 --> 01:03:01,362
is out and torn.
That means..

440
01:03:03,770 --> 01:03:04,870
Shut up.

441
01:03:50,875 --> 01:03:52,326
What is here?

442
01:04:02,878 --> 01:04:05,341
Hey! What happened?
- No.

443
01:04:05,461 --> 01:04:07,310
Hey, why are you shouting?
What happened? - Something bit me.

444
01:04:07,430 --> 01:04:09,245
Snake bit me.
- Snake?

445
01:04:09,365 --> 01:04:10,719
Yes. - Where did it go?

446
01:04:11,356 --> 01:04:13,479
Look there, it is going.
- Where did it bite you?

447
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:15,238
Where did it bite you? Show me.

448
01:04:15,617 --> 01:04:18,564
Look here. Here. Here.

449
01:04:18,872 --> 01:04:20,115
It is hurting.

450
01:04:20,928 --> 01:04:23,436
Don't move. Let me see.

451
01:04:26,042 --> 01:04:28,516
It is hurting.
Do something soon.

452
01:04:29,818 --> 01:04:32,094
Look carefully, is it snake bite?

453
01:04:32,446 --> 01:04:34,117
A snake has really bit you.

454
01:04:35,921 --> 01:04:37,307
Which color snake was it?

455
01:04:37,955 --> 01:04:39,803
Black. Black.

456
01:04:39,923 --> 01:04:41,265
Black?

457
01:04:41,485 --> 01:04:44,710
Did you see it properly?
- Yes, I did.

458
01:04:48,691 --> 01:04:50,484
You are shivering. Yes.

459
01:04:50,604 --> 01:04:52,276
Do you hear strange voices?

460
01:04:56,178 --> 01:04:58,828
Yes.
- What else are you feeling?

461
01:05:00,565 --> 01:05:01,885
I can hear it.

462
01:05:02,094 --> 01:05:04,513
You've been bit by
a dangerous snake. - Dangerous?

463
01:05:04,633 --> 01:05:06,185
You mean.. - Show me your eyes.

464
01:05:06,405 --> 01:05:08,593
Oh, they have turned yellow.

465
01:05:09,010 --> 01:05:12,617
Show me your tongue.
Oh, this has become dry.

466
01:05:13,573 --> 01:05:14,761
Show me your nails.

467
01:05:15,102 --> 01:05:17,367
The color has changed.
Bhuvana, your time is over.

468
01:05:17,487 --> 01:05:19,358
What will I tell your dad?
- Don't tell that.

469
01:05:19,478 --> 01:05:20,721
Do something, but save me.
- There's only one way.

470
01:05:20,841 --> 01:05:22,459
- I will have to
suck the poison out

471
01:05:23,309 --> 01:05:24,915
How? - What do you mean how?

472
01:05:25,333 --> 01:05:26,542
With my mouth.

473
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:29,424
Mouth?

474
01:05:30,171 --> 01:05:32,767
Okay, hurry up.
Do whatever you want, but hurry up.

475
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:35,043
I don't want to die.
- Okay, turn.

476
01:05:39,489 --> 01:05:40,787
What happened?

477
01:05:57,214 --> 01:05:59,920
Hurry up. What are you doing?

478
01:11:24,421 --> 01:11:25,260
Such a bitch

479
01:11:25,262 --> 01:11:28,262
I will not spare her
I'm going to take care of her - Palasa

480
01:11:28,264 --> 01:11:30,000
Palasa...wait...Palasa
- Uncle, let me go.

481
01:11:30,001 --> 01:11:31,266
- If you keep dancing around like this

482
01:11:31,267 --> 01:11:32,260
..he will kill us
- Let me go.

483
01:11:32,261 --> 01:11:34,363
Let's go. Let's go.

484
01:11:57,783 --> 01:11:58,805
What the hell are you doing?

485
01:11:59,425 --> 01:12:01,000
If a snake had bit me
there should be two marks

486
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:03,187
I have only one. - Poor snake
maybe its missing a fang.

487
01:12:04,387 --> 01:12:05,630
You cheated me

488
01:12:05,750 --> 01:12:07,973
You are lying to me
A snake did not bite me.

489
01:12:08,093 --> 01:12:09,710
Maybe it was an old snake

490
01:12:09,830 --> 01:12:11,712
Because it is old, maybe one fang was not working

491
01:12:13,669 --> 01:12:16,121
Shameless guy. Such a bloody a liar.

492
01:12:17,618 --> 01:12:19,763
I feel so dirty now.

493
01:12:20,467 --> 01:12:22,248
I have to go and have bath.

494
01:12:24,404 --> 01:12:26,658
I know you are jealous
of that girl because she's close to him

495
01:12:26,778 --> 01:12:29,319
You don't know what to do about it and are restless
Is that it?

496
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:31,236
The guy with a solution
for your problem.

497
01:12:31,356 --> 01:12:32,809
lives in and around this area

498
01:12:32,929 --> 01:12:34,601
He is crazy about girls.

499
01:12:34,721 --> 01:12:36,383
I will tell him about her.

500
01:12:36,503 --> 01:12:38,011
Then he will kidnap her.

501
01:12:38,131 --> 01:12:41,541
Raja will belong to you
and his money to me.

502
01:12:42,122 --> 01:12:43,398
Who is he?

503
01:12:43,903 --> 01:12:45,487
Dangerous Dega.

504
01:12:55,373 --> 01:12:57,702
Hey you, you work for me..

505
01:12:58,098 --> 01:13:00,957
..and you inform the Sheriff
that I supply dynamite.

506
01:13:11,146 --> 01:13:14,302
Take this. There's only
one bullet in this revolver.

507
01:13:14,676 --> 01:13:16,469
You can try and shoot me

508
01:13:16,589 --> 01:13:19,669
do die by my axes
Choice is yours.

509
01:13:19,789 --> 01:13:21,986
If I die, you are safe to go

510
01:13:22,106 --> 01:13:24,021
Or else you'll die.

511
01:13:39,785 --> 01:13:41,292
Dispose him.

512
01:13:41,523 --> 01:13:42,694
Well done Dega

513
01:13:42,814 --> 01:13:45,421
No one can beat you at
throwing knives

514
01:13:45,541 --> 01:13:48,809
Dubey, what made a
cheater like you come to me?

515
01:13:49,413 --> 01:13:52,713
You like good liquor, delicious
kebabs, and young girls, don't you?

516
01:13:52,833 --> 01:13:55,732
I will show you such a girl
that you'll be surprised.

517
01:16:07,138 --> 01:16:09,041
Leave me. No!

518
01:16:10,085 --> 01:16:11,152
Let me go.

519
01:16:11,272 --> 01:16:13,275
Don't let her go. Take her.

520
01:16:13,395 --> 01:16:14,517
Serves her right

521
01:16:15,375 --> 01:16:17,003
Hey grab her too

522
01:16:26,368 --> 01:16:28,501
She came to have bath.
Where did she go?

523
01:16:39,967 --> 01:16:42,321
What are you doing here?
- Something very bad has happened

524
01:16:42,441 --> 01:16:45,680
Dega took both the girls
and fled from here.

525
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:46,923
Who is Dega?

526
01:16:47,043 --> 01:16:48,903
I gave him a little information about your girl

527
01:16:54,181 --> 01:16:56,117
If something happens to
that girl..

528
01:16:56,237 --> 01:16:57,662
..then I will rip your skin.
- You can deal with me later

529
01:16:57,782 --> 01:16:59,586
Please save both the girls first

530
01:17:03,050 --> 01:17:05,370
Looking at these two beautiful girls

531
01:17:05,490 --> 01:17:07,471
It is hard to wait until tonight.

532
01:17:07,591 --> 01:17:09,362
Come on!

533
01:17:10,343 --> 01:17:12,884
Why are you walking
like a lazy donkey?

534
01:17:13,004 --> 01:17:14,236
Don't you hear me?

535
01:17:14,356 --> 01:17:16,612
A little buildup. Just so they believe
my character.

536
01:17:16,732 --> 01:17:18,943
You are pushing it.
- Okay, let's go.

537
01:17:20,263 --> 01:17:21,967
Move ahead.

538
01:17:26,828 --> 01:17:27,939
Hey Dubey

539
01:17:28,059 --> 01:17:31,161
You should be bringing more girls
not guys.

540
01:17:31,392 --> 01:17:32,668
Who is he?

541
01:17:32,788 --> 01:17:34,845
He is golden goose.

542
01:17:34,965 --> 01:17:37,735
Hand him over to any Sheriff
and you'll be drowning in cash

543
01:17:38,934 --> 01:17:41,771
Look at this. $25,000 in Palasa
$30,000 in Muvara.

544
01:17:41,891 --> 01:17:43,102
$50,000 in Yerragadda.

545
01:17:43,222 --> 01:17:44,487
He is like a blank cheque

546
01:17:44,607 --> 01:17:47,236
Hand him over at any place, time
and we'll get super rich

547
01:17:47,356 --> 01:17:49,860
You'd sell your mom and dad  for some pocket money

548
01:17:49,980 --> 01:17:52,225
Why did you bring him to me
instead of handing him over yourself?

549
01:17:52,345 --> 01:17:53,918
Actually, he is very cunning.

550
01:17:54,038 --> 01:17:56,392
I was able to catch him with great difficulty
I'm worried I won't be able to handle him alone

551
01:17:56,512 --> 01:17:58,746
If you help me,
We can earn nice money.

552
01:17:58,866 --> 01:18:01,044
Just give me 50 percent of the reward

553
01:18:01,961 --> 01:18:04,589
What are you watching?
Tie him with girls.

554
01:18:04,709 --> 01:18:05,755
Let's go. - Stop!

555
01:18:08,504 --> 01:18:10,538
Not there, tie him in the tent.

556
01:18:13,222 --> 01:18:15,432
He is capable of escaping
even if you hold him right infront of our eyes

557
01:18:15,552 --> 01:18:16,763
If you tie him there,
he will definitely run.

558
01:18:16,883 --> 01:18:19,842
So lets just tie him along with those girls
and keep our eyes on him

559
01:18:20,425 --> 01:18:22,647
What are you watching?
Tie him, take him!

560
01:18:23,735 --> 01:18:26,671
Don't try to escape from here,
or you'll get killed.

561
01:18:34,454 --> 01:18:35,609
Scoundrel.

562
01:18:39,150 --> 01:18:40,227
my savior

563
01:18:42,247 --> 01:18:45,601
Dega, we drank liquor
and ate kebabs..

564
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:48,175
if you give me the money
..I will leave now.

565
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:51,672
Let me have fun these girls first.

566
01:18:52,870 --> 01:18:54,350
After handling those girls..
my foot you'll give me anything

567
01:18:54,470 --> 01:18:56,945
you'll probably give them everything

568
01:20:20,914 --> 01:20:23,003
I said you'd throw over there,
why did you throw it here?

569
01:20:36,755 --> 01:20:40,612
Did you come here to free the girls?

570
01:21:07,055 --> 01:21:10,618
The revolver that I gave you
has only one bullet in it.

571
01:21:10,738 --> 01:21:13,939
Either you'll kill me
or I will kill you.

572
01:21:14,059 --> 01:21:15,237
It is your choice.

573
01:21:15,357 --> 01:21:18,734
If you kill me, you are safe to leave from here
If you miss, you'll die

574
01:22:22,271 --> 01:22:24,085
Don't shoot.
There's dynamite.

575
01:22:24,205 --> 01:22:25,553
Go and nab him.

576
01:22:42,466 --> 01:22:44,138
Run!

577
01:22:44,258 --> 01:22:46,964
Let's flee from here. Hurry up.
- Uncle, where are you taking me?

578
01:22:53,417 --> 01:22:54,617
You?

579
01:23:06,659 --> 01:23:08,858
Look for him. He must be
hiding somewhere.

580
01:23:45,387 --> 01:23:47,070
Bhuvana, go. Go!

581
01:23:47,190 --> 01:23:49,654
No, I am scared.
- They are coming. Go.

582
01:25:33,950 --> 01:25:35,182
Hey!

583
01:26:03,908 --> 01:26:05,360
Come on.

584
01:26:34,408 --> 01:26:36,046
Pleaaa....

585
01:26:40,357 --> 01:26:42,315
No. No. Please No.

586
01:26:44,162 --> 01:26:46,904
Degaaaaa! - You want
to play with knifes? Come on.

587
01:26:47,024 --> 01:26:50,137
Dega Dega Dega Dega Dega Dega Dega Dega

588
01:26:50,257 --> 01:26:51,907
Cha Cha Cha...Cha Cha Cha...Cha Cha Cha

589
01:26:52,027 --> 01:26:53,546
Cha Cha Cha...

590
01:26:53,666 --> 01:26:55,690
Cha Cha Cha...Cha Cha Cha

591
01:26:59,935 --> 01:27:01,248
Throw the knife now. Why don't you throw it now?

592
01:27:01,368 --> 01:27:03,954
Throw it. Why don't you throw it now? Cmon Throw Dega

593
01:27:04,074 --> 01:27:05,867
Throw!

594
01:27:10,937 --> 01:27:12,542
It must atleast 200 feet of drop

595
01:27:14,036 --> 01:27:15,102
Minimum

596
01:27:17,115 --> 01:27:18,874
You want girls eh? - No. Girls?

597
01:27:20,997 --> 01:27:23,042
You son of a bitch....let's go...let's go

598
01:30:50,709 --> 01:30:51,941
Shaka.

599
01:30:53,788 --> 01:30:56,746
The man that you were looking
for from 18 years

600
01:30:56,866 --> 01:30:58,647
we found out where that Veeru dada is

601
01:31:29,728 --> 01:31:33,148
'There'll be a spot on his body.'

602
01:31:33,995 --> 01:31:37,129
'On his upper left thigh.'

603
01:31:37,531 --> 01:31:40,457
That old woman said
that I will marry the guy with a birthmark

604
01:31:40,699 --> 01:31:42,557
Does this guy have
a birthmark on his thigh?

605
01:31:42,677 --> 01:31:44,998
Hope Raja has the spot.

606
01:31:45,251 --> 01:31:47,198
How do I find it out?

607
01:31:57,668 --> 01:32:00,978
Raja, I made tea for you.

608
01:32:01,098 --> 01:32:02,187
You made tea for me?

609
01:32:02,623 --> 01:32:04,272
Something fishy.

610
01:32:05,328 --> 01:32:06,692
Do you need something?

611
01:32:06,812 --> 01:32:09,617
I don't want anything, just have..
- What is this?

612
01:32:10,101 --> 01:32:13,103
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Hurry, remove your pants. - What?

613
01:32:13,367 --> 01:32:14,665
It fell on my shirt, why should
I remove my pants?

614
01:32:14,785 --> 01:32:17,031
Its okay. I'll clean it and
give it back

615
01:32:17,151 --> 01:32:19,231
Hey, are you out of your mind?
Go away!

616
01:32:23,971 --> 01:32:25,917
I knew you were upto something

617
01:32:27,116 --> 01:32:28,787
Why is he so shy to
remove his pants?

618
01:32:28,907 --> 01:32:30,876
What's harm in removing once?

619
01:32:32,317 --> 01:32:34,032
He ruined my plan.

620
01:32:35,671 --> 01:32:37,420
Tea plan went out of the window

621
01:32:41,093 --> 01:32:43,138
How do I make him
remove his pants?

622
01:32:44,130 --> 01:32:47,044
How do I find whether
he is my prince or not?

623
01:32:48,287 --> 01:32:50,223
I can't take this tension

624
01:32:51,201 --> 01:32:52,631
Think, think.

625
01:33:07,589 --> 01:33:10,603
Idea!
Look what I do now.

626
01:33:23,327 --> 01:33:24,624
Look, fire.

627
01:33:24,625 --> 01:33:26,086
The fire is starting to spread

628
01:33:26,087 --> 01:33:27,859
Hurry, remove your pants.

629
01:33:27,979 --> 01:33:29,551
You are after my pant again.
- You'll get burnt.

630
01:33:29,671 --> 01:33:31,058
Are you crazy.
- You'll get burnt.

631
01:33:31,178 --> 01:33:32,234
One minute.

632
01:33:32,235 --> 01:33:34,405
Did you drink some liquor early in the morning?

633
01:33:34,406 --> 01:33:36,605
I am telling for your own good.
Remove your pants. - Hey!

634
01:33:36,725 --> 01:33:39,915
Please, remove it once.
- Bhuvana, go away.

635
01:33:40,300 --> 01:33:43,236
He is showing so much attitude
as if I'm molesting him.

636
01:33:43,356 --> 01:33:44,387
Coward.

637
01:33:44,937 --> 01:33:46,697
How did I catch fire suddenly?

638
01:34:11,097 --> 01:34:13,517
I just have to do
what he did to me

639
01:34:13,946 --> 01:34:15,540
Look what I do now.

640
01:34:27,089 --> 01:34:28,573
You?

641
01:34:28,693 --> 01:34:30,091
There's a snake. There!
- Snake?

642
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:32,301
Hope it didn't bite you.
- Where did it go? - Are you feeling dizzy?

643
01:34:32,421 --> 01:34:33,753
Are your hands shivering. - What?

644
01:34:33,873 --> 01:34:35,105
What are you blabbering?
I have to remove the poison.

645
01:34:35,225 --> 01:34:37,266
What?
Remove your pants

646
01:34:37,386 --> 01:34:40,016
What are you doing?
Why are you after my pant?

647
01:34:42,545 --> 01:34:44,535
I am sure, you've gone insane.

648
01:34:44,744 --> 01:34:46,449
I have to kill your dad for dumping you on me

649
01:34:51,898 --> 01:34:54,559
How do I know
if he has the spot or not?

650
01:35:08,514 --> 01:35:10,010
My dear daughter.

651
01:35:10,274 --> 01:35:14,595
Wherever you are, I pray to God
that you are always happy.

652
01:35:15,565 --> 01:35:17,753
I know death is chasing me

653
01:35:18,061 --> 01:35:19,689
I would've died long back..

654
01:35:20,019 --> 01:35:22,273
..if that doctor didn't end up finding me

655
01:35:42,373 --> 01:35:45,331
Don't get up. Lie down.

656
01:35:45,727 --> 01:35:47,266
Who are you?

657
01:35:47,541 --> 01:35:48,641
I am a doctor.

658
01:35:48,761 --> 01:35:50,532
You were lying wounded
near the river.

659
01:35:50,652 --> 01:35:51,929
I brought you here

660
01:35:52,589 --> 01:35:55,173
I was able to save you but

661
01:36:06,143 --> 01:36:08,375
There were a lot of bullets lodged
in that leg

662
01:36:08,684 --> 01:36:12,588
I had to amputate your leg without your permission
to save your life.

663
01:36:24,043 --> 01:36:26,561
Here, have this soup.
You'll feel better

664
01:36:42,110 --> 01:36:43,847
They are the ones who shot me.

665
01:36:43,967 --> 01:36:45,178
They will not spare me.

666
01:36:45,298 --> 01:36:47,674
You saved my life,
but they'll kill me.

667
01:36:47,794 --> 01:36:49,636
Doctor, you save my life.

668
01:36:49,756 --> 01:36:52,166
Save me from them, doctor.

669
01:37:03,020 --> 01:37:04,604
You leave from this jungle.

670
01:37:05,704 --> 01:37:07,519
Doctor, you gave me a new life.

671
01:37:07,639 --> 01:37:10,410
So, I would like to give you
something. Here. Thanks.

672
01:37:13,577 --> 01:37:15,793
I only did my duty as a doctor.

673
01:37:15,913 --> 01:37:17,025
I can't accept this.

674
01:37:17,145 --> 01:37:19,059
Keep it. For my sake.

675
01:37:25,514 --> 01:37:26,515
Look inside.

676
01:38:47,295 --> 01:38:48,670
18 years..

677
01:38:49,726 --> 01:38:52,739
..I lost my sleep. I lost my happiness

678
01:38:52,993 --> 01:38:56,093
Like a mad dog....I was looking for you.

679
01:38:57,380 --> 01:38:58,809
Tell me

680
01:38:59,615 --> 01:39:00,714
Tell me.

681
01:39:02,166 --> 01:39:03,915
Tell me where it is!

682
01:39:06,873 --> 01:39:09,116
Hey, for it..

683
01:39:09,952 --> 01:39:12,239
I killed my own brother for it.

684
01:39:13,143 --> 01:39:15,870
Tell me soon. Tell me!

685
01:39:18,113 --> 01:39:19,884
You escaped that day.

686
01:39:20,478 --> 01:39:22,138
But not today.

687
01:39:22,468 --> 01:39:24,448
Tell me. Tell me!

688
01:39:24,745 --> 01:39:26,383
Tell me! Tell me!

689
01:39:26,384 --> 01:39:27,715
Tell me.

690
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:30,514
Tell me.

691
01:39:33,905 --> 01:39:35,240
Tell me.

692
01:39:35,241 --> 01:39:36,440
Tell me!

693
01:39:37,749 --> 01:39:40,003
Hey, tell me.

694
01:39:45,501 --> 01:39:48,736
Hey, Hey, Tell me. Tell me.

695
01:39:50,737 --> 01:39:52,839
Tell me

696
01:39:56,840 --> 01:39:57,959
Tell me!

697
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:02,819
Hey! Tell me!

698
01:40:02,820 --> 01:40:04,757
Tell me where it is!!

699
01:40:20,035 --> 01:40:22,146
Hey, Heyy!

700
01:40:22,531 --> 01:40:24,315
Heyyyy!!!

701
01:40:25,316 --> 01:40:26,371
Hey!!He died without telling where it is!

702
01:40:27,372 --> 01:40:30,371
No! No! Hey!! Hey!!

703
01:41:11,372 --> 01:41:14,781
Shaka, He has a daughter
He also has a brother in Palasapadu

704
01:41:14,781 --> 01:41:16,815
His name is Dharma.
He found out after inquiring people

705
01:41:25,489 --> 01:41:28,381
Raja, we've traveled lot.

706
01:41:28,678 --> 01:41:30,129
I am tired.

707
01:41:30,249 --> 01:41:31,614
Can we rest for some time?

708
01:41:31,734 --> 01:41:33,604
There's a village nearby.
We'll stay there.

709
01:41:34,088 --> 01:41:35,353
Okay.

710
01:41:42,344 --> 01:41:46,061
My legs have become sore
by climbing mountains.

711
01:41:46,423 --> 01:41:48,848
I heard this is the only
hotel in this town

712
01:41:49,321 --> 01:41:52,356
I am sure, Raja will end up here eventually
Tie it.

713
01:41:52,476 --> 01:41:53,918
I will drink some liquor.

714
01:41:54,038 --> 01:41:56,150
This means, that girl will be here.

715
01:41:56,270 --> 01:41:57,774
You handle the girl..

716
01:41:57,775 --> 01:41:59,703
..I will handle Raja.

717
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:24,163
Hey!! 

718
01:47:25,400 --> 01:47:27,163
Oh my god

719
01:47:27,164 --> 01:47:29,163
Stop running after me

720
01:47:38,164 --> 01:47:41,122
Raja.. - Tell me.
- I'm thirsty. We're out of water.

721
01:47:41,242 --> 01:47:43,234
Is it your stomach or ocean.

722
01:47:43,354 --> 01:47:45,356
Was that a joke?
Am I supposed to laugh?

723
01:47:48,137 --> 01:47:50,094
Hey, look there's a house.

724
01:48:04,948 --> 01:48:07,290
Not here,
we'll go somewhere else.

725
01:48:07,675 --> 01:48:10,281
I'm sure, we'll find water here.
Let's go.

726
01:48:10,963 --> 01:48:12,360
Please.

727
01:48:23,361 --> 01:48:25,382
Hey. Stop. Stop.

728
01:49:31,383 --> 01:49:32,670
Raja..

729
01:50:23,828 --> 01:50:26,539
Raja, what happened to you?

730
01:50:27,803 --> 01:50:31,180
Since you've seen the house,
you are very quiet.

731
01:50:31,938 --> 01:50:33,357
What's the matter?

732
01:50:42,353 --> 01:50:43,849
Whose toys are these?

733
01:50:51,300 --> 01:50:55,050
Sharing your sorrow with others
reduces your pain.

734
01:50:55,787 --> 01:50:57,217
Won't you tell me?

735
01:51:17,919 --> 01:51:19,701
This is you and this is me.

736
01:51:19,821 --> 01:51:21,658
Isn't our house beautiful sis?

737
01:51:21,778 --> 01:51:24,022
What about this dog then?

738
01:51:24,286 --> 01:51:26,134
Will you stay with us in our house?

739
01:51:26,354 --> 01:51:27,893
You will stay right?

740
01:51:30,209 --> 01:51:32,046
Sister, stop.
Wait for me!

741
01:51:32,409 --> 01:51:34,476
- Come, come! 
- Wait

742
01:51:34,773 --> 01:51:36,170
- Come, come! 
- Stop! Wait for me

743
01:51:36,720 --> 01:51:38,435
Hey!

744
01:51:38,555 --> 01:51:40,019
Stop.

745
01:51:40,931 --> 01:51:41,877
Sister!

746
01:51:44,964 --> 01:51:46,932
Are you hurt?

747
01:51:52,177 --> 01:51:53,014
It is hurting?

748
01:52:01,379 --> 01:52:03,051
I am fine. Let's go.

749
01:52:04,414 --> 01:52:06,086
Wait Sis! I'm coming

750
01:52:06,823 --> 01:52:08,023
Stop, sister.

751
01:52:27,240 --> 01:52:28,868
He was in this house.

752
01:52:29,132 --> 01:52:30,847
You treated him.

753
01:52:31,199 --> 01:52:33,673
He gave this diamond
to you in return.

754
01:52:34,135 --> 01:52:36,713
You helped him escape from here.

755
01:52:36,999 --> 01:52:38,594
I don't know.
- Don't know?

756
01:52:44,851 --> 01:52:46,885
Tell me, which way did he go?

757
01:52:46,886 --> 01:52:47,520
I don't know

758
01:52:47,521 --> 01:52:49,522
You don't know?

759
01:52:50,567 --> 01:52:51,832
Tell me.

760
01:52:52,074 --> 01:52:53,624
Tell me, which way did he go?	

761
01:52:54,031 --> 01:52:56,362
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

762
01:52:59,420 --> 01:53:01,481
What did he tell you?

763
01:53:01,601 --> 01:53:03,922
Which way did he go? Tell me. Tell me.

764
01:53:04,494 --> 01:53:07,144
What did he say? - Dad!

765
01:53:09,135 --> 01:53:10,949
Please, leave my dad.

766
01:53:23,223 --> 01:53:25,731
No, leave my daughter alone!

767
01:53:32,093 --> 01:53:33,203
Sister?

768
01:53:36,360 --> 01:53:39,747
You daughter is very well behaved.

769
01:53:40,172 --> 01:53:41,854
Please, let her go.

770
01:53:41,974 --> 01:53:43,900
Let her go, please.
- Hey, doctor.

771
01:53:44,120 --> 01:53:47,683
You have a high tolerance to pain

772
01:53:47,803 --> 01:53:51,466
But this innocent girl
can't handle it

773
01:53:51,730 --> 01:53:52,583
Just tell me

774
01:53:52,703 --> 01:53:55,618
I am telling the truth,
I found him with injuries

775
01:53:55,738 --> 01:53:58,279
I just did my duty as a doctor.
I don't know who or

776
01:53:58,399 --> 01:54:00,378
where he came from

777
01:54:08,778 --> 01:54:10,004
Hey!

778
01:54:10,005 --> 01:54:12,133
I'll kill you .... hey!

779
01:54:12,134 --> 01:54:14,449
Hey!!! - Leave me alone you

780
01:54:21,450 --> 01:54:22,714
Hey!

781
01:54:25,079 --> 01:54:27,476
You can't kill me

782
01:54:27,596 --> 01:54:30,148
If you can, try and save your dad

783
01:54:47,526 --> 01:54:52,012
Hey doctor, your son is
unable to endure your weight.

784
01:54:52,331 --> 01:54:55,422
If you wish to ease his pain,
then tell me soon.

785
01:54:55,993 --> 01:54:57,489
The guy you treated

786
01:54:57,953 --> 01:54:59,592
Where did he go!?

787
01:56:10,464 --> 01:56:11,750
Dad!

788
01:56:17,340 --> 01:56:18,649
Dad!

789
01:56:21,695 --> 01:56:23,026
Hey!

790
01:56:38,170 --> 01:56:39,765
He died without telling anything

791
01:56:39,885 --> 01:56:43,466
Veeru should still be in and around this area

792
01:56:45,677 --> 01:56:46,985
Find him.

793
01:57:04,932 --> 01:57:06,318
Dad!

794
01:57:11,857 --> 01:57:13,717
Dad.

795
01:57:15,728 --> 01:57:17,091
Dad!

796
01:57:49,798 --> 01:57:52,854
My dad saved many lives
He killed him.

797
01:57:52,855 --> 01:57:55,011
He killed my innocent sister. I'm going to catch him.

798
01:57:56,363 --> 01:57:59,333
One day I'll find him and kill him.

799
01:58:01,367 --> 01:58:04,314
I started stealing things to survive and
find him.

800
01:58:05,359 --> 01:58:07,547
But I couldn't find him until now Bhuvana

801
01:58:08,152 --> 01:58:10,791
You said he wore a mask right?

802
01:58:11,209 --> 01:58:13,606
It will be difficult to recognize
him after so many years.

803
01:58:14,712 --> 01:58:18,407
I can't forget the wound
on his hand.

804
01:58:19,418 --> 01:58:22,607
I am sure that
he'll die by my hands.

805
01:58:23,718 --> 01:58:26,291
I will not spare him.

806
01:58:43,324 --> 01:58:44,666
Oh.

807
01:59:10,042 --> 01:59:12,252
A spot on his leg.

808
01:59:12,253 --> 01:59:14,272
Yes! I found him!

809
02:04:14,405 --> 02:04:16,257
I brought you here safely

810
02:04:16,258 --> 02:04:18,276
My duty is done. I'm leaving.

811
02:04:18,277 --> 02:04:20,283
Your work will be finished
only when..

812
02:04:20,284 --> 02:04:22,569
..you drop me inside.

813
02:04:23,570 --> 02:04:26,649
Hope you won't ask me
to stay after going inside.

814
02:04:26,650 --> 02:04:29,000
If you wish to stay, you can.

815
02:04:29,883 --> 02:04:31,379
You go, I will come.

816
02:04:57,835 --> 02:04:59,088
Uncle!

817
02:05:03,037 --> 02:05:06,912
Bhuvana, you stay here.
I will get sheriff.

818
02:05:59,891 --> 02:06:01,046
Sherriff..

819
02:06:19,304 --> 02:06:21,636
Somebody has killed
bank manager Dharma.

820
02:06:21,878 --> 02:06:24,001
How did you know?

821
02:06:24,385 --> 02:06:25,507
Who are you?

822
02:06:25,804 --> 02:06:28,740
I am the one who brought
his niece here. - Dharma's niece?

823
02:06:29,312 --> 02:06:30,500
Is it? - Yes.

824
02:06:30,973 --> 02:06:32,502
Dharma's brother Veeru sent me
to drop her daughter..

825
02:06:32,622 --> 02:06:34,976
..to his house, but when
we reached.. - Okay.

826
02:06:35,295 --> 02:06:36,702
Let's go and see.

827
02:06:59,546 --> 02:07:02,361
Poor guy. Dharma was a good man.

828
02:07:04,086 --> 02:07:06,055
Who would stab and kill him?

829
02:07:06,286 --> 02:07:07,825
Its unbelievable.

830
02:07:17,971 --> 02:07:20,336
Raja, this map was in my locket.

831
02:07:29,871 --> 02:07:32,620
Give it to me.
This is the map. - Who are you?

832
02:07:49,823 --> 02:07:52,956
After so many years.
I found it.

833
02:07:52,957 --> 02:07:55,630
I was restless every
day to get this map.

834
02:07:55,631 --> 02:07:58,135
I have waited for 18 years for this.

835
02:07:58,136 --> 02:08:00,545
This is the map of treasure.

836
02:08:00,595 --> 02:08:02,730
The map of diamond mine
that is worth billions.

837
02:08:02,850 --> 02:08:05,490
I wasted 18 years of my life
searching for this

838
02:08:05,610 --> 02:08:07,008
Now I found it!

839
02:08:07,733 --> 02:08:10,844
This is a map to mine with thounds of diamonds

840
02:08:10,964 --> 02:08:12,252
Now I'm the one who found it

841
02:08:13,868 --> 02:08:15,595
I found it! Yes!

842
02:08:16,717 --> 02:08:19,565
I killed my own brother for it.

843
02:08:20,511 --> 02:08:23,874
I lost count how many
people I killed looking for this

844
02:08:24,270 --> 02:08:27,415
You killed Dharma
for this map, right?

845
02:08:27,535 --> 02:08:30,274
Yes, I thought this girl gave
him the map

846
02:08:30,516 --> 02:08:31,506
Not only Dharma..

847
02:08:31,626 --> 02:08:33,420
..I killed her disabled father too.

848
02:08:33,540 --> 02:08:36,327
I searched for him my entire life
and now I killed him

849
02:08:38,164 --> 02:08:40,055
You killed my dad?

850
02:08:44,674 --> 02:08:45,950
You!

851
02:09:25,310 --> 02:09:26,476
Hey!

852
02:10:18,633 --> 02:10:20,757
You ruined my life's work

853
02:10:20,966 --> 02:10:23,440
I spent  many sleepless nights in search of this

854
02:10:23,560 --> 02:10:26,332
You ruined it all!

855
02:10:34,499 --> 02:10:35,951
No!

856
02:10:53,710 --> 02:10:56,261
What do you know how valueable that map is?

857
02:10:56,591 --> 02:10:59,659
Now no one knows where it is...No one

858
02:11:18,290 --> 02:11:22,425
You saw it. You know the way.

859
02:11:24,537 --> 02:11:25,747
You'll take us there.

860
02:11:26,324 --> 02:11:28,342
 No! Raja!

861
02:11:29,277 --> 02:11:30,849
Please, don't hurt thim. Raja

862
02:11:31,223 --> 02:11:32,873
Please leave Raja!  Please!

863
02:11:32,993 --> 02:11:34,929
I'm begging you! 

864
02:11:36,178 --> 02:11:37,926
Please, Raja!

865
02:11:39,389 --> 02:11:40,521
Please.

866
02:11:40,994 --> 02:11:43,205
Raja! He doesn't know anything.

867
02:11:43,325 --> 02:11:44,590
I'll do whatever you say.

868
02:11:44,710 --> 02:11:46,768
I will take you till there.
But leave him. - Hey!

869
02:11:47,592 --> 02:11:49,733
Whoever goes against Shaka..

870
02:11:50,118 --> 02:11:52,890
..meets with this fate.
Understood?

871
02:11:54,803 --> 02:11:56,728
I beg of you.

872
02:11:56,848 --> 02:11:58,993
Please, leave Raja.

873
02:11:59,113 --> 02:12:00,862
Please, leave him.

874
02:12:00,982 --> 02:12:02,339
I.. - Shut up!

875
02:12:02,459 --> 02:12:03,504
Please.

876
02:12:04,351 --> 02:12:07,265
I will show you the way.
- Take her along.

877
02:12:18,497 --> 02:12:22,192
Raja, I'm giving you
a different death.

878
02:12:23,072 --> 02:12:24,237
It will be fun.

879
02:12:27,404 --> 02:12:28,592
Listen..

880
02:12:29,601 --> 02:12:31,251
..kill me now.

881
02:12:32,779 --> 02:12:35,078
If I escape, you'll repent.

882
02:13:58,536 --> 02:14:01,493
Fingers showing the way?
Tell me the truth

883
02:14:02,285 --> 02:14:04,672
Which way?
Which Way!?

884
02:14:05,694 --> 02:14:07,421
Aren't we supposed to take that route?

885
02:14:07,541 --> 02:14:08,883
Remember properly and tell me

886
02:14:09,003 --> 02:14:12,150
The map said there should be fingers 
pointing the way

887
02:14:12,270 --> 02:14:13,502
I'm telling the truth. - You are lying.

888
02:14:13,622 --> 02:14:15,089
Stop lying or else...

889
02:14:18,729 --> 02:14:21,808
If you try to hit me again..

890
02:14:21,928 --> 02:14:24,525
..Raja will chop your hand.

891
02:14:29,107 --> 02:14:30,427
Him?

892
02:14:35,331 --> 02:14:38,004
He is dead. He's no more.

893
02:14:38,290 --> 02:14:40,423
Vultures would be
eating him by now.

894
02:14:46,137 --> 02:14:49,205
Raja will surely come.
If not for me..

895
02:14:50,426 --> 02:14:52,383
..to avenge his father's death

896
02:14:52,981 --> 02:14:55,763
To kill the one who hanged him.

897
02:14:56,302 --> 02:14:57,863
when he 10 years old.

898
02:14:58,666 --> 02:15:00,118
He will live and come

899
02:15:14,699 --> 02:15:16,305
Shaka, look there.

900
02:15:47,175 --> 02:15:48,924
This.. these are the fingers

901
02:15:50,342 --> 02:15:51,640
We have to go this way.

902
02:16:15,396 --> 02:16:16,572
Raja..

903
02:16:25,665 --> 02:16:26,841
Raja.

904
02:17:03,466 --> 02:17:06,431
Where are you going?
- To save Bhuvana.

905
02:18:16,343 --> 02:18:20,005
After crossing the river,
there's a turn, then..

906
02:18:20,214 --> 02:18:23,480
..after walking 180 steps,
you'll see the diamond mine.

907
02:19:06,644 --> 02:19:08,700
Hey! You go!

908
02:20:53,312 --> 02:20:54,676
Hey!

909
02:20:56,523 --> 02:20:58,074
Didn't I tell you..

910
02:20:59,207 --> 02:21:01,560
..that you'll repent
by leaving me alive.

911
02:21:01,867 --> 02:21:03,308
Stop!

912
02:21:05,288 --> 02:21:06,541
Listen!

913
02:21:06,926 --> 02:21:10,038
You'll do a mistake by killing me.

914
02:21:14,293 --> 02:21:16,635
Along with my death..

915
02:21:16,899 --> 02:21:18,977
..a secret will be hidden.

916
02:21:20,649 --> 02:21:22,398
Oh! You don't get it

917
02:21:22,936 --> 02:21:25,092
Only I know..

918
02:21:25,554 --> 02:21:29,346
..who your father's murderer is.

919
02:21:40,275 --> 02:21:44,300
Are you surprised to know
how I know your father's murderer?

920
02:21:44,894 --> 02:21:48,259
Your father had a noose
and was standing on your shoulders.

921
02:21:49,732 --> 02:21:51,503
I know that person very well

922
02:21:56,513 --> 02:21:59,581
Go ahead. Kill me.

923
02:21:59,955 --> 02:22:03,936
But that information will die with me

924
02:22:06,058 --> 02:22:09,024
Who is he? Tell me.
- I will tell you.

925
02:22:10,124 --> 02:22:12,268
But you have to do my work.

926
02:22:13,753 --> 02:22:17,470
Like you have fire of revenge
in your heart from past 18 years..

927
02:22:17,987 --> 02:22:20,461
..same way,
I wandered restless to find those diamonds.

928
02:22:23,701 --> 02:22:25,548
Take me there once.

929
02:22:26,175 --> 02:22:29,276
Then I will tell your
father's murderer's name.

930
02:22:31,025 --> 02:22:33,323
If you want your revenge

931
02:22:33,740 --> 02:22:35,719
you have to take us there

932
02:22:55,080 --> 02:22:56,367
Okay.

933
02:22:57,731 --> 02:22:59,072
I will take you there.

934
02:22:59,873 --> 02:23:01,225
Let that girl go.

935
02:23:02,336 --> 02:23:04,953
Hey, free the girl.

936
02:23:08,879 --> 02:23:11,079
Raja, I'm not going
anywhere leaving you.

937
02:23:12,112 --> 02:23:13,866
I finally have a chance to know..

938
02:23:13,986 --> 02:23:15,988
..who killed my
father and sister.

939
02:23:19,056 --> 02:23:21,398
I will not spare him. - Raja
Bhuvana.

940
02:23:23,114 --> 02:23:24,500
You go away.

941
02:23:38,568 --> 02:23:41,702
I don't think you'll need this.

942
02:28:21,530 --> 02:28:23,927
This is the turn that
girl was talking about.

943
02:28:24,191 --> 02:28:26,094
After walking 180 steps..

944
02:28:26,358 --> 02:28:28,062
..we can reach the diamond mine.

945
02:28:28,182 --> 02:28:29,834
Start counting.

946
02:28:30,274 --> 02:28:33,991
1, 2, 3, 4..

947
02:28:34,541 --> 02:28:38,302
..5, 6, 7, 8,

948
02:28:38,830 --> 02:28:40,886
..9, 10..

949
02:28:47,060 --> 02:28:50,590
21, 22, 33, 34..

950
02:28:50,975 --> 02:28:53,834
..55, 66, 77,..

951
02:28:54,076 --> 02:28:56,891
..88, 89, 90!

952
02:29:13,444 --> 02:29:14,621
Hey!

953
02:29:15,193 --> 02:29:17,931
Go back and count again.

954
02:29:24,383 --> 02:29:26,164
Where is rest of the way?

955
02:29:29,870 --> 02:29:32,730
..88, 89, 90!

956
02:29:33,958 --> 02:29:35,420
This is 90 Shaka

957
02:29:36,102 --> 02:29:38,390
90 here? Did you count properly?

958
02:29:40,050 --> 02:29:42,337
Where is the diamond mine?
There's a waterfall here

959
02:29:49,492 --> 02:29:52,043
Hey, what are you thinking?
Is this the way?

960
02:29:52,681 --> 02:29:54,452
If you cheat me..

961
02:29:54,572 --> 02:29:56,904
..or if I don't get the
diamond mine, I will kill you.

962
02:30:11,079 --> 02:30:12,398
91,..

963
02:30:15,135 --> 02:30:16,499
92..

964
02:30:19,105 --> 02:30:20,491
93..

965
02:30:21,492 --> 02:30:24,945
94, ...

966
02:31:31,036 --> 02:31:33,148
175...

967
02:31:33,763 --> 02:31:37,579
176, 177..

968
02:31:38,646 --> 02:31:41,780
178, 179.

969
02:33:27,594 --> 02:33:28,848
Hey!

970
02:33:30,009 --> 02:33:33,099
Hey! What do you think of me?

971
02:33:33,352 --> 02:33:35,837
Do you think I'm a fool?
Tell me.

972
02:33:36,585 --> 02:33:37,971
Where's the diamond mine?

973
02:33:38,091 --> 02:33:40,203
Where's the diamond mine?
Tell me where it is?

974
02:33:40,907 --> 02:33:43,139
Where is it tell me?
Scoundrel, tell me.

975
02:33:46,362 --> 02:33:49,463
Where are the diamonds?
Where are the diamonds?	

976
02:34:14,732 --> 02:34:16,294
Diamonds!

977
02:34:44,229 --> 02:34:45,526
I found them.

978
02:35:07,761 --> 02:35:08,982
Diamonds.

979
02:35:10,093 --> 02:35:13,436
Yes, diamonds.
I found my diamonds.

980
02:35:15,933 --> 02:35:18,055
Look at me!

981
02:35:18,175 --> 02:35:19,716
I found the diamonds

982
02:35:21,365 --> 02:35:24,037
This is all mine

983
02:35:33,865 --> 02:35:35,658
These diamonds belong to me. These diamonds belong to me.

984
02:36:20,689 --> 02:36:22,411
You got what you wanted.

985
02:36:23,115 --> 02:36:24,930
Tell me who killed my dad.

986
02:36:25,480 --> 02:36:27,492
You have to do one more thing.

987
02:36:39,482 --> 02:36:41,649
You have to take
the diamonds out.

988
02:36:41,935 --> 02:36:43,606
Only then I'll tell you.

989
02:38:25,236 --> 02:38:28,513
I can't forget that mark
on your hand.

990
02:40:23,652 --> 02:40:26,797
Your father and sister died like a dog

991
02:40:27,435 --> 02:40:29,503
..I will kill you too.

992
02:40:47,362 --> 02:40:50,749
This! is what is called a dog's death

993
02:41:08,275 --> 02:41:09,441
Your tip.

994
02:41:28,100 --> 02:41:29,573
Are you Raja?

995
02:41:46,022 --> 02:41:48,662
Can you help me get to this
this island?

996
02:41:51,741 --> 02:41:53,413
It is difficult to go there.

997
02:41:54,205 --> 02:41:57,273
Jungle, wild animals,
and big mountains.

998
02:41:58,274 --> 02:42:00,638
Don't try to build it up.
Let's just talk business.

999
02:42:02,694 --> 02:42:04,803
Okay. 50-50.

1000
02:42:07,575 --> 02:42:10,269
I mistook you for a kid
but looks like you are pretty cunning

1001
02:42:12,633 --> 02:42:14,481
I know that way.

1002
02:42:14,998 --> 02:42:17,040
I will take you there
without taking any commission.

1003
02:42:17,160 --> 02:42:18,557
Beware of her.

1004
02:42:21,295 --> 02:42:23,363
Who is she?
- He?

1005
02:42:25,771 --> 02:42:27,157
He is the thief of thieves.
