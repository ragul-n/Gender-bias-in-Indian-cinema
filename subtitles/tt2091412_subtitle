1
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:28,866
Make it fast. Make it fast. Quick,
quick. Get down quickly.

2
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:41,611
Make it fast.

3
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,484
l'll help you.
- Okay.

4
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,318
Take this.
- Thanks a lot. Okay.

5
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:54,654
Hasn't Ammukuttamma got down?

6
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,622
What is this? We are returning.

7
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:04,128
lf you want come, you can pray
to Guruvayoor Appan once more.

8
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:08,067
Don't make fun of me.
l woke up early.

9
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:10,775
l slept because of the breeze.

10
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:15,570
We remember Malayalam on first of
the month, when we see Ammukuttamma.

11
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:19,849
l wish no hindrance
should come for that. - Yes.

12
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:26,848
When l see Guruvayoor Appan and pray
all my worries should go away.

13
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,858
We will get the power to go on with life.

14
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:32,031
That is why our leader had made it a habit.

15
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:38,033
He got the blessings of that till death.
That's correct. Go, go.

16
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:46,708
l have bought some Guruvayoor Appan.

17
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:50,041
Give it to Nalini.
l need not walk till there to give this.

18
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:52,216
Give it to Minnu.

19
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:58,891
l didn't notice you.
Take this and give it at home.

20
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:03,728
You teach her to climb
a coconut tree as well.

21
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,728
Then she will do the chopping
and getting the liquor.

22
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:22,572
Minnu. What is this?
Let me see. Pappad.

23
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,917
So Ammukuttattethi has
come from Guruvayoor.

24
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,914
Keep this inside. Keep it.

25
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,258
She has come.

26
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,092
You mother and son lock
the house and go away.

27
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:40,095
People who come for some work
get into problem, Ammukutty Amma.

28
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:42,494
Shankara. Today is first.
- l know.

29
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,602
Brother Mathai told me that
you left early morning.

30
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:47,272
Give some offerings to me as well.

31
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:49,236
Who are these people?

32
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:51,102
Guruvayoor Appan.

33
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,278
They have come to see
Ajayan from Olavacode.

34
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:57,677
They want to start some business.
They asked me about that.

35
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:58,609
What business?

36
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:02,948
That's what even l thought. ln Palakkadu
Town a good photo studio is for sale.

37
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:04,453
But Ajayan is not interested.

38
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:08,783
Then l asked him how about buying
a bus? After buying a bus..

39
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:13,227
''Later on if l have problem with union,
l'll lose my honor and money.''

40
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,630
''After that l'll have to
again go back to Gulf.''

41
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:20,897
Saying this he jumped at me.
Those kinds of experiences are there.

42
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:26,634
This is something he will like.
He is fond of farming.

43
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:30,973
For farming some equipment are required.
Hand gloves, pickaxe, axe, cutting knife.

44
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:32,981
There is a small factory
which makes all this.

45
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:34,653
lt is not very far away from here.

46
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:39,223
What is wrong with you? There is no
one here to manage whatever is there.

47
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:43,321
He came from Gulf sometime back.
That time he bought lot of paddy fields.

48
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:49,261
Then there is coconut, vegetable.
He went to Attapadi and bought plantations.

49
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,437
With that let this factory also be there.

50
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:54,333
There is no need to pour
water and plough for this.

51
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,998
The machine will work if we put the switch.
There are workers to do all the work.

52
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:00,679
l did all this on Ajayan's instruction.

53
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,839
Then you ask him.
- Where is he now?

54
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:08,448
Since the last 18 years he
has been out of station.

55
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:10,915
Even after his coming back,
his excitement is still not over.

56
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:15,958
He'll leave in his bike in the morning.
Where ever drum is playing, he'll be there.

57
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:50,719
Central-TmG

58
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:06,143
This is great. This is not a female troop.
This is a female matt.

59
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:08,911
lf it catches our attention, it's gone.
Then you don't feel like leaving.

60
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:10,082
From how many days are you practicing?

61
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:13,582
lt's since the time we started.
Our Malar will not allow us to teach here.

62
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:16,016
Today, sternly, l told
everyone to come here.

63
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:19,089
Why, Krishneta, are you so
opposed to this female troop?

64
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:22,261
l have some knowledge
about it's rules, that's why.

65
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:24,429
Ajayan. lf we cook knowledge,
will our stomach be filled?

66
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,030
Before he used to go to play
in the festival. l agree.

67
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,497
Now by God's grace no one
is calling for any programme.

68
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:33,365
Why are they not calling?
- Why? - Jealousy.

69
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:37,267
During festival time l learnt to play
this instrument in 12 days.

70
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:41,274
ln Karanjithara hearing my drum
beat Mattanur has become flabbergasted.

71
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,939
Many have fallen on my legs
and taken my blessings.

72
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,118
Do you know?
Why are you laughing?

73
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:49,117
They must have fallen on legs begging
not to play like this and trouble them.

74
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:50,619
l'll hit you.

75
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:52,615
What is the use of knowledge?

76
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:54,884
You had liquor and went to play.
Will anyone call you again seeing that?

77
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,790
Who had liquor? Me?
- Leave it, Krishneta.

78
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:00,795
Let her study from here and go.
lt is only drum playing.

79
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,798
How much ever she excels,
she is nothing before you.

80
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:05,971
That is known to everyone.
You all start.

81
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,924
Did you see?
- Yes.

82
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:12,002
lt is not that we can't manage
this or it is in loss.

83
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:15,367
After partition both sisters
together got this as their share.

84
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:18,202
lf we get money, it can be easily
distributed between them.

85
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:19,537
l also don't want this in urgency.

86
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:22,543
As this business is connected
with soil, l came and saw.

87
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:26,445
l told you. - l worked for years
in Madras, Mumbai and Gulf.

88
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:28,483
lf it was to only make money,
l could have stayed there itself.

89
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,212
But my native place is my weakness.

90
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:33,051
The rain, the breeze of this place.
The paddy which we grow here.

91
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:37,059
The local vegetables that
we grow. Onam, Vishu, Folk arts.

92
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:39,231
l want to enjoy all that
for the rest of my life.

93
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:43,459
He is working hard here
also in plantation field.

94
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:48,732
Shankaretta. l'll tell an
amount from my calculation.

95
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:53,901
lf it is okay with them, we'll buy this.
lt'll be okay. - Yes. - That.

96
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:45,460
After eating this,
sleep properly.

97
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:53,303
What is the use of all this?
People still consider me as stingy.

98
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:56,805
Who called you stingy?
- Who didn't?

99
00:12:57,343 --> 00:13:02,144
There is no use of blaming them.
There is money, land, and plantation.

100
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:05,806
Now l'm a factory owner.
Even then we don't have a servant.

101
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:07,986
People will think l'm troubling
you by making you work.

102
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:13,488
Whom are you calling as aged?
You are not allowing me to dye my hair.

103
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:15,990
Even now if we stand together,
l look younger than you.

104
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:19,323
Don't catch on to that.
Now age is not the issue here.

105
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:22,330
You are not allowing
to keep a servant.

106
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,834
This is a house where
only we two are there.

107
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,407
What work is there here
which we can't do?

108
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:35,068
Does making flatbread
and washing cloths suit me?

109
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:36,509
Mahatma Gandhi has
done so many jobs.

110
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:39,183
Always Mahatma Gandhi.
Am l like him? - Go.

111
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:42,514
lt is not enough to have money.
We should have the luck to enjoy it too.

112
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:45,690
lf there was a servant, we could
have given her all this work.

113
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:48,189
Then you can take rest and enjoy.

114
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:51,522
Then l'll become sick and we
have to spend on medicines.

115
00:13:57,803 --> 00:14:00,033
People say that you don't trust me.

116
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,764
We tried so many of them.

117
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:05,869
That Pattambi female
was a good servant.

118
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:08,410
Did you allow her to work
here even for 10 days?

119
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:10,274
She is not clean. She is not
listening to what you say.

120
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:13,713
You found mistake in everything that she did.
at last when she left, you were happy.

121
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:18,117
You are correct.
l was happy only when she left.

122
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,884
She was a female who was
deserted by her husband.

123
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:25,325
She is still young. lf people gossip,
whose name will be spoilt?

124
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,898
People don't keep servant for
work thinking about this?

125
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:32,069
You get married. Then you
live with wife and children.

126
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:34,068
Then you can keep as many
servants as you want.

127
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:35,831
l'll not object that time.

128
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:41,240
When l spoke about that
why did you become silent?

129
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:46,713
How old was l when father died?
- Two and half years old.

130
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:49,079
Two and half years old.
Weren't you young at that time?

131
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:52,189
Everyone compelled you to remarry.
You didn't agree.

132
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,689
Why? To give all your love to me.

133
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:59,329
Think that l'm also like that.
lt is enough if l live for my mother.

134
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:01,761
Get lost. l don't want to
listen to these justifications.

135
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:02,934
l have told you this many times.

136
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,602
l don't like any of these
kinds of responsibilities.

137
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:09,773
A female who has no relation to
us will become the boss of this place.

138
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:14,002
She'll interfere in our work.
She will call my mother as ''mom''.

139
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:18,282
l have to call her parents whom
l don't know, as father and mother.

140
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:21,510
Some third rate guys will come
here calling me as brother-in-law.

141
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,123
What a bore idea it is.
We both mother and son are enough.

142
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:30,121
We'll fight, love, get angry
and live our life here.

143
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:32,723
Only that much time is
there in this life. - Leave me.

144
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:37,960
Go to sleep. Sleep.
Good night.

145
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,967
God. Almighty.

146
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:46,371
Ammukutty Amma.
Are you not going to sleep?

147
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:48,239
When l get sleep,
l'll sleep.

148
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:53,646
You must not sleep just like that.
You must see nice dreams as well.

149
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:57,310
l have only one dream to see.
That is of your marriage.

150
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:21,169
Central-TmG

151
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:30,120
Get up. Go. Come around
this podium. - You go.

152
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,693
Thinking that this is the groom
put this garland to it.

153
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,807
Turn that side and stand.

154
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:05,218
Auspicious. All the bad
omens are gone.

155
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:10,388
Now you see Mani smart guys will
come here and stand in a queue.

156
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:14,660
What is this matter? - Nothing.
lt is to remove a small problem.

157
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,560
All the marriage offers that come
are getting into problem.

158
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,637
When we saw her horoscope she
had some problems in that.

159
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,307
Then we decided to remove that.

160
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,903
When did you become
such big believer in it?

161
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:31,578
When you had love marriage with Nalini, did
you see the horoscope or match at that time?

162
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,581
ln that situation...

163
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:36,084
For love marriage only
one match is required.

164
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:37,846
Hearts should match. lsn't it, Manietta?

165
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:42,756
They had a good heart match.
She came to study Hindi to me.

166
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:45,656
He came to my younger
uncle's house for slashing.

167
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:49,090
Not even a fly knew about
their love for 3 years.

168
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:53,364
A day before her engagement
they both eloped.

169
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,097
Who gave me the courage to elope?
This Ammukutty Ettathi.

170
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:59,004
What to do? They both were going to
commit suicide by coming in front of a train.

171
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:03,639
That is when l told them to go to
Guruvayoor and get married.

172
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:05,449
What happened due to that?

173
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:10,281
Till death younger uncle didn't talk to me.
- You need not tell all that now.

174
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,614
For this banana tree marriage,
is there no feast?

175
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:14,725
We can have a feast.
You come inside.

176
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:20,559
l have some work. Mom has at last
agreed to keep a servant. - ls it? - Yes.

177
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,859
Lot of conditions are there.
Her age should be above 50 years.

178
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:25,298
Beauty should be below average.

179
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,904
That is if you see once you shouldn't
feel like seeing again. - Get lost.

180
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:28,971
ls the bride hiding?

181
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:33,639
Sunanda. As all your problems are
over shall l find a good boy for you?

182
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:36,406
First you find one for yourself.
Then you can find for others.

183
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:41,143
l'm going to become a sage.
Swami Ajayananda Saraswati Om.

184
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:11,680
Come.

185
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:16,912
She is busy at work.
This is women's soap company.

186
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:19,181
But she is the in-charge of it.

187
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:22,849
Manian is still continuing with chopping
as that is his hereditary job.

188
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:26,126
This income is more then
enough for them to live.

189
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:30,529
Thangappetta. Don't exaggerate.
We know how difficult it is to run this factory.

190
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:32,704
Then you need not face
any difficulty any more.

191
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,805
Next Sunday boy
and his family will come.

192
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:38,135
Uncle has to be satisfied.
Rest everything is only a formality.

193
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,971
That is what the boy says.
This is uncle.

194
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:43,111
He will say whether he is satisfied.

195
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,476
What is your name?
- Sunanda.

196
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,882
Till which class has you studied?
- Till twelfth grade.

197
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:55,558
She only decided that that much is enough.
What is the use ofjust studying?

198
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:59,054
l have not seen her
idle even for a minute.

199
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:03,162
After this work is over she goes for
tailoring work in Women's Association.

200
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:05,403
Not to learn, but to teach.

201
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:09,404
Rest of the matter
we'll talk to the father.

202
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,673
Broker. - Yes.

203
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:22,586
Did he like me? - Or else?
- Shouldn't l say yes?

204
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:27,654
This is a rich family. Boy has a vegetable
wholesale shop in Pollachi market.

205
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:31,589
He is very busy. They have
two cars which run as taxi.

206
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,828
One lorry. Above all he is the only son.

207
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:38,903
Father has slight amnesia.
The mother has to be there for everything.

208
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:41,935
Last week she fell down.
There was no injury.

209
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,164
She became paralyzed from one side.

210
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,434
That is why they decided to have
this marriage done quickly.

211
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:48,846
To look after a sick person
can't they keep a home nurse?

212
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:51,444
Will that home nurse
be a match to relatives?

213
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:52,776
She will be better than a relative.

214
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:55,453
You go and tell them not to
get him married now.

215
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:57,519
lnstead of that to keep a
good servant on salary..

216
00:20:57,723 --> 00:20:59,691
Then what for did we do all
those prayers and offerings for?

217
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:05,124
That is dad's madness. Just to
satisfy him l cooperated with him.

218
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:09,130
Thangappa. Bus is coming.
- Go. Bus is coming.

219
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:10,798
Thangappa.

220
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:19,166
Not up to the mark.
See the ripe one and cut. - Okay.

221
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:26,209
Kumara. Don't stand there idly,
do some work. - l'm doing it.

222
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:31,819
Take that gunny bag and
go there. - We'll ask him.

223
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,825
Where is Karingal Mathai's house?

224
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:42,666
Karingal Mathai's house?
ls it nearby?

225
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,002
What are you all looking at?
lf you can't work, leave.

226
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:53,003
Why do you want to meet Mathai?

227
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:57,170
Not to see Mathai, but to see the
neighbor Ammukutty Amma.

228
00:21:57,683 --> 00:22:00,675
They said they wanted a
servant for their house.

229
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:04,788
lf l ask about Karingal Mathai here
he'll tell, that was what was told.

230
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:07,525
Andappa. - Yes.

231
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:10,354
After here you cut coconut in Unni Variyar's
place also. Then only you should stop.

232
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:13,122
Okay. - Come. - Come.

233
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:17,759
From where are you coming?

234
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:21,769
From Cherakara.
This girl is related to me. - Girl?

235
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:24,235
What is the name of this girl?
- Swarnalatha.

236
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:27,273
Best name.
- Many people say that.

237
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,204
Anyway gold is very costly now.

238
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:39,819
What a speed?
He is coming as if he is in an airplane.

239
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:46,389
No need to see.
That guy fell down.

240
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:49,157
Can't a man ride a cycle?

241
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:54,735
Who is this, Mathai? - Me.

242
00:22:56,608 --> 00:23:06,574
Central-TmG

243
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:14,852
l want to see how Shakuntala
eats without our knowledge?

244
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:20,922
Meenakshi. There are only two options
in front of Shakuntala. Either..

245
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:25,433
ls this the girl Kuttappan
carpenter sent? - Yes.

246
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:28,162
lt looks like we are standing in the
ground so much noise and sound.

247
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:31,601
She has a condition that she has
to see TV from 7:00pm to 10:00pm.

248
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:32,777
While joining itself she said that.

249
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:34,445
Then l'll come back only after
10 o'clock in future.

250
00:23:34,646 --> 00:23:38,878
You only wanted a servant.
- l'll change her.

251
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:45,516
The calf has to be changed.
Milk is getting reduced.

252
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:47,788
Swarnalatha. - Yes.

253
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:50,857
You sweep here. After that clean
the cow dung and wash this place.

254
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:53,394
The smell of cow dung makes
me feel like vomiting.

255
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,964
Don't the cows in your place
produce cow dung?

256
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:57,897
l'm not talking about my place.
l'm talking about myself.

257
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,401
This matter was regarding
cow that's why l said.

258
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:03,641
Are you the cow's lawyer?
Don't try to teach me.

259
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:05,469
lt has been years since
l'm working as a maid.

260
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:08,202
Household work includes this, girl.

261
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:11,871
Don't call me girl. l have a name.
lt is Swarnalatha.

262
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:16,144
The name is superb. - Why are you
making fun? Didn't you like it?

263
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:18,151
l liked it. l liked it.

264
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:33,164
Jesus. Why are you looking at
the raw banana like this?

265
00:24:33,371 --> 00:24:35,168
You come on this side.
Let it get ripe.

266
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:38,501
That is what l also thought.
lt has a lot of weight.

267
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:41,508
lf we don't give it support, it'll fall.

268
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:50,013
Now are you happy?
- Ritamma. l told you, it needed support.

269
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:54,090
The root is not strong enough.
- Why did you say all this?

270
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:57,795
This is too much.
- Wait there. - What?

271
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,361
Where are you going?
- To the back side.

272
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:04,024
Now you need not go there.
l am feeding the chickens there.

273
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:06,534
Let them live for some more years.

274
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,197
Jesus. What a test is this?

275
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:15,141
Test? Jesus? See how my banana
is lying? l watered it so many times.

276
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:19,448
Father. Take this tea. - Why are you
going so early in the morning?

277
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:21,983
Ms. Sarala will be taking tuition.

278
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:29,554
When did you buy a cycle?

279
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:32,093
l didn't buy it. lt is a gift from
my uncle in Mumbai.

280
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:37,398
How is the new servant?
- l think there won't be any problem.

281
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:39,399
l think it'll be problematic.

282
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:42,239
From her behavior l don't think
she'll stay here for long.

283
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,237
Please. Don't say anything like that.
Whatever you say comes true.

284
00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:47,070
l'm stating the fact.
You all blame me for it.

285
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,247
Why is brother Mathai angry
in the morning itself?

286
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:53,076
Toddy is not coming like before
from coconut and jaggery.

287
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:54,309
That is what everyone
is complaining about.

288
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:57,420
But Sugunan gets full vessel
of liquor every day.

289
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:02,089
Can't you shut up?
- You kids..

290
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:04,262
Who is that throwing stone?

291
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:07,693
Run, run. Come fast.
- Run away. - Run, run fast.

292
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:19,777
What is this, mom? Servant
has been kept to do this.

293
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:24,438
l can do all this. Swarnalatha is not
used to grind cotton seed.

294
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:27,777
Once l grinded gram in this grinding
stone that's when my thumb got crushed..

295
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:29,783
l was on meditation for a week.

296
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:32,616
You have been kept here to
help my mother in old age.

297
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:35,952
l'm paying you the salary that was fixed.
You are still making my mother suffer.

298
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:37,992
Don't feel bad if l say something.

299
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:40,629
l have not worked in a house
which is so uncultured.

300
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:43,027
l have seen many
who keep cow at home.

301
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:46,226
They buy food from shop and
give it to them. Work is over.

302
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:48,630
Such old age practices..

303
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:51,134
l think Mathai's words are
going to come true.

304
00:26:54,012 --> 00:27:00,474
Go fast. - Get in.
Get in fast. Start. Right.

305
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:08,250
Why didn't you come last week, donkey?

306
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,485
We waited for you the whole day.
Our programme was spoilt.

307
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:13,095
l started for here. That's when
minister did a urgent visit.

308
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,163
l got caught.
- You leave your police job.

309
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,995
l'll make you the manager
in my factory. - Where?

310
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:19,670
The factory where you make
hand gloves and axes?

311
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:21,168
Why are you talking so lowly about it?

312
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:23,000
You come and have a look.
There is a lot of progress.

313
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:25,676
We are making machines
to plough and cut grass.

314
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:28,072
ln this Palakkad district there
is no better factory than this.

315
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:30,839
That is what you are saying.
- Not only me..

316
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:33,847
The professor from the agriculture
university, Mr. Pithambaran had come.

317
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:37,510
He congratulated me and said,
''l'm proud of you my son.''

318
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:41,188
A fool will praise himself.
An intellect will praise a fool.

319
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:42,451
ln your case both is correct.

320
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,185
l take back my words of
making you my manager.

321
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:46,694
lt is best that you waste your
life as a police inspector.

322
00:27:46,898 --> 00:27:47,694
Sit.

323
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:50,694
Then what happened to the programme?

324
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:54,531
l have planned it very well.
lt was locked for a long time.

325
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:57,537
So when we open it again,
we should change the name.

326
00:27:57,742 --> 00:28:00,711
For the opening ceremony
there are dances, folk dances.

327
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:02,038
Then drama. - Drama?

328
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:05,212
They are not professionals.
The artists here are going to perform it.

329
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:08,386
lt won't happen. This is not the Kerelam
that you saw when you left form here.

330
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:12,716
Book for some mimicry or cinematic dance.
You won't get anyone for drama and rehearsal.

331
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:14,221
All that is old fashioned.

332
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:16,826
Bala. We must get back
those old fashioned..

333
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:21,055
That is our culture. Our land,
our breeze and our folk arts.

334
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:24,064
Enough, enough. You are always
saying our land, our breeze.

335
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:26,237
Has some one given you
poison in nostalgic?

336
00:28:26,438 --> 00:28:27,905
You come to the temple
side in the evening.

337
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:30,571
Then you'll understand
the progress of this place.

338
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:36,174
Take it. - Okay.

339
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:43,246
This is an ideal wife.

340
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:46,652
The minute she knew husband is
bringing fish, meat, all is ready.

341
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:49,257
This is the benefit of marrying
a Christian girl.

342
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:51,929
Beautiful girls are there near
my station in Malapuram.

343
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,257
Not only fish and rice,
they'll make good pilaf as well.

344
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:54,932
Shall l find a girl for you?

345
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:58,261
No need. l like to fly as a free bird

346
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:01,597
Be careful while flying.
You'll get trapped in a cage or a net.

347
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:06,042
Even if l get caught l know how to
release myself from that. lsn't it?

348
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:10,442
You have kipped so many times.
- Those are old cases. She is standing.

349
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:12,673
Will you meet father in the afternoon?
- Of course.

350
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:15,444
His black-eye power is increasing.

351
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:19,111
He broke that Sugunan's
vessel with one dialogue.

352
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:20,450
He is saying just like that.
- No.

353
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:22,216
lsn't there that mango tree in
the front of the house? - Yes.

354
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:26,955
lt had flowered very nicely.
He just said it has flowered very nicely.

355
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:28,456
The full flowers got burnt.

356
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:30,224
Frankly l'm still scared
to stand in front of him.

357
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:33,029
You should be scared. Not because
of brother Mathai's black-eye.

358
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:37,002
You came to my house, showed all tactics
That's how you made his girl fall for you.

359
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:40,006
lf he catches you alone,
he will surely to hit you.

360
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,970
Why are you standing there
and talking? Come inside.

361
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:46,912
l'll come later on, sir.
Go, go. He need not get angry.

362
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,647
Kids have come. - You carry on
with your family sentiments.

363
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:51,719
Let's meet in the evening.
- Okay. - Bye.

364
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:59,658
Come. Daddy. - Father.
When did you come?

365
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:01,263
l came just now. Come.

366
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:07,664
The entertainment program is good. We must
get Kavya Madhavan for the inauguration.

367
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:10,102
l thought l'll bring lshwarya Rai.

368
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:14,074
Kaviya Madhavan is enough. She'll come
with sandalwood on her forehead.

369
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:18,340
lf she stands before audience with folded
hands, there is no need for a lamp.

370
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,280
For the time being the lamp is enough.
This programme is conducted by our people.

371
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,351
So for everything our people are enough.

372
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:25,355
l have my doubts about drama as to whether
we'll get people from here to perform?

373
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:30,187
l have arranged all that. Only 2
characters have to be finalized.

374
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:32,522
Heroine and villain.
- Balatten is there.

375
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:35,699
l can't perform. - lt is possible.
We'll make you do it.

376
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,027
We must have a very good drama.
l'm notjoking.

377
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:41,865
One thing. l don't have time.
l can't take it as and when l wish.

378
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,104
Not only that, l have a good
name as a police officer as well.

379
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,710
l won't perform drama and
spoil that name of mine.

380
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:50,312
That won't work. - Keep quiet.
- No one needs to shout.

381
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,881
He'll agree. l'll make him agree.
- That's okay.

382
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:55,314
Who'll be the heroine?
- Can we get Swetha Menon?

383
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,786
l'll kick you. You want Menon? - lf there
had been an actress, it would be good.

384
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:02,559
lf Ajayan decides,
he can bring cinema stars.

385
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,287
l don't know anyone now.
- As if you knew all the old stars.

386
00:31:06,497 --> 00:31:09,398
What doubt? l know
Unni Mary and Silk Smitha.

387
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:14,561
l have taken photo with them.
Haven't you seen it in my album?

388
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:17,070
No. - ls it? - Of course.

389
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:20,073
lf we give money many photo shops
will make even kissing photos.

390
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:23,145
That is now.
l'm talking about 20 years back.

391
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:24,747
Where was Photoshop that time?
- Correct.

392
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:29,909
Forget cinema stars.
l had so many beautiful girlfriends.

393
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:34,249
lf l get one of them on stage,
this Malar will be shocked.

394
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,495
You are a lucky fellow.
- lt is not only luck.

395
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:44,100
The situation that time was like that.
l came to Madras when l was young.

396
00:31:44,302 --> 00:31:51,105
No one to question me.
Till l reached Mumbai, those 5-6 years..

397
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:53,603
Where, what bachelor life was..

398
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:55,942
Then?

399
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:59,279
Kodambakam is the
central place for beauties.

400
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:06,956
The black, oily beauties, the females keeping
flowers & wearing ornaments used to catwalk.

401
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:11,821
ln Mahabalipuram Ayyappan temple
our Malayali girls used to come.

402
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:16,456
Oh, dear. Those were the days.
- Ajayan. How many lovers did you have?

403
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:21,298
l never got into anything serious.

404
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:25,133
The minute l used to feel someone was
getting serious l used to leave her.

405
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:25,968
Then l used to find another one.

406
00:32:26,177 --> 00:32:29,635
The bees jump to many
flowers and collect nectar.

407
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:31,872
lt sits on a flower,
collects nectar and flies away.

408
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:33,812
lt sits on a flower,
collects nectar and flies away.

409
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:36,646
lt keeps flying from one to another.
That was what like my life also.

410
00:32:36,854 --> 00:32:38,651
You forget about the bees
and come to the point.

411
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:42,155
Who will be the actress?
- Suddenly l went into flash back.

412
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:47,730
Let me get over that.
lt collects nectar and flies away.

413
00:32:57,208 --> 00:33:07,174
Central-TmG

414
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:13,188
Where is the other party?
- She left.

415
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:16,257
ln one day she was also
fed up and l was also fed up.

416
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:18,588
She left with this
whole month's salary.

417
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:20,696
No problem. At least she left.

418
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:22,024
Why are you standing here?

419
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:26,363
She called me and l came.
- l had to make hair oil.

420
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:28,664
That work was over earlier itself.

421
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:31,808
We kept talking and it became late.

422
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:35,878
You drop her home.
- Can't you go home before dark?

423
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,345
You just get her across that farm.
- Come.

424
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:42,775
ln future you need not think
of keeping a servant.

425
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:47,287
Aunt is totally fed up. Nowadays
you don't get any one reliable.

426
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:49,783
Why are you not talking, Ajayettan?

427
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:54,988
l was wondering how to tell you. - What?

428
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:58,862
l'm afraid you may not like it.
- ls it such a serious matter?

429
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,503
Yes. - lt's okay, tell me.

430
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,003
Don't think why l'm
suddenly feeling like this.

431
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:06,108
Actually, not suddenly,
l have been thinking for a long time.

432
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:08,335
God. ls it such a big suspense?

433
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:09,808
Your father won't have any objection.

434
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:11,948
Your mother may not like it.

435
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:18,685
lf you don't like it, then say so.

436
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:22,826
Don't think l'll feel bad.
l'll manage some how.

437
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:29,062
Can you act in our play as the heroine?

438
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:35,166
Only two scenes are there.
There are not many dialogues.

439
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:39,673
l asked many, but no one worked
out well. You'll be perfect.

440
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:43,938
l didn't think that you'll become so mad.
- Please. - l can't.

441
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:46,878
All the others are neighbors.
You won't have any problem.

442
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,916
lt won't work.
l'll come to see.

443
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,883
Even if the drama is a bore,
l'll clap.

444
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,181
You find someone else to act.

445
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,448
Have you reached?
- Yes.

446
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:55,717
l was coming there as
she hadn't reached home.

447
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:58,191
Then Ajayettan, you go.
- What about drama?

448
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:00,364
Not possible.
- You think.

449
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,088
Will you act?

450
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:05,059
You also can't?

451
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:07,031
No one is ready to act.

452
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:13,702
Hasn't our hero woken up?
- No.

453
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:15,503
He said he'll be going with
you for morning walk.

454
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:18,375
l should wake him up at 5:30.

455
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:20,141
l have called so many times.
My throat is aching.

456
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:21,511
He is such a lazy fellow.

457
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:24,153
He goes for this walk
only when you come.

458
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:26,014
That is why he is getting fat.

459
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:29,350
Get up.

460
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,222
Don't sleep like a buffalo.
Come for a walk.

461
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:33,286
Today?

462
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:36,831
Today. l'll hit you.

463
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:43,532
l have only the starting problem.

464
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:45,903
Now if you say l can run for 3 or 4 hours.

465
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:49,444
You need not run.
You should walk brisk daily for half an hour.

466
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,774
You won't do that.
- lt's because l don't have a company.

467
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:56,545
l'm thinking of starting yoga.
That l can do alone at home.

468
00:35:56,754 --> 00:35:58,890
'Shavasan' is one thing that
you'll do without any mistakes.

469
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:00,551
lt that you can just sleep.
- l'll buy treadmill.

470
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:02,783
l know lot of people
who bought treadmill.

471
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,188
First 10 days they'll use it.

472
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:06,329
Then they'll use it for
drying undergarments.

473
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:09,523
You keep saying our land, our breeze.

474
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:12,703
You have to just walk
breathing this fresh air.

475
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:13,802
Your health will be fine.

476
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,439
l think your health is
going to deteriorate.

477
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:18,541
Look who is coming.

478
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:21,510
Don't look there.

479
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:26,210
Now, do we have to walk
in reverse, briskly?- But..

480
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:29,386
Walk bravely.
You call yourself a policeman.

481
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:37,392
Central-TmG

482
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:38,652
Are all of you coming back from church?

483
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:41,297
No, all of us are coming
back from Sabari Malai.

484
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:44,865
Get lost.

485
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:51,164
Mother. Come here.

What is the matter? - Come and look.

Put it here. Put it here.

491
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:04,655
Goal.

492
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:07,824

00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:10,758
Leave it, Chinnu.

Now l'll throw.

Both of them have grown up.

497
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:26,236
Where is father?
- He is in the front.

498
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:29,170
Rose, dear.

499
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,940
Take a basket of soil and
put it in the flowerbed.

500
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:34,674
You take the kids and
go near the fence.

501
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:38,013
Your mother is standing
there to see you and kids.

502
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,189
Her idea of coming here
is also only that.

503
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:42,154
She'll say just like that
we'll go to Ajayan's house.

504
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,021
How long it's been since
l met Ammukutty Amma.

505
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:45,525
She is interested in seeing her parents.

506
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:48,494
lf it was so urgent,
l could have seen them in the church.

507
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:50,291
They come there every Sunday.

508
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:52,867
They talk to you
when they see you there?

509
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,595
No one needs to talk to me.
l don't want to see anyone.

510
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:58,975
What vigor?
- Let that stand like that.

511
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:00,939
Then only we can see this drama.

512
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:04,478
Now by making some reason
sister Ritamma will come here.

513
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:10,019
Keep a little bit over there.
l'm also your daughter.

514
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:12,621
This is for Ammukutty Amma.

515
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,091
Why are you smiling?

516
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:18,194
Give it to me.
- Chinnu. Give it to me.

517
00:38:18,396 --> 00:38:20,887

- Give it to me.

518
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:25,732
l'll throw it.
- l'll throw it.

519
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,402
Who is this?

520
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:30,073
Come.

521
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:33,437
From morning l have been
telling her to give this here.

522
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:36,613
She doesn't listen to me.
- What all is there?

523
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:40,750
lt was sent from my house for the festival.
Some cookies and sweets.

524
00:38:41,018 --> 00:38:43,748
Why have you given so much?
Only we two are here.

525
00:38:43,954 --> 00:38:46,479
Let it be. We got this from the pond.

526
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:49,023
l had put it in water.
lt is not spoilt.

527
00:38:49,226 --> 00:38:51,319
We don't cook fish here.
Don't you now that, Rita?

528
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:54,225
Let it remain. lf someone
comes, you give it them.

529
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:57,697
Ritamma. Come inside.
- l have kept 'Copra' in sunlight.

533
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:16,685
My mother-in-law is sick.
Last time also she enquired.

534
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:18,787
She wanted to know
if everyone was well?

535
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:27,729

There is nothing wrong with me.

Why have you not put the light outside?

584
00:45:16,313 --> 00:45:18,076
The cow is not tied in the shed.

585
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,248
Who is that boy outside?

586
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:34,995

That is what he said.

594
00:45:56,687 --> 00:45:59,850
- Without my knowledge
how can l have a son?

595
00:46:00,057 --> 00:46:02,958
Not suddenly.
He was born some what 16 years back.

ln Tamil Nadu.
- What are you saying?

597

lf anyone comes and says, will you believe it?

598
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:09,564

What is your deal?
Money or some thing else?

l don't want money.
- Then?

605
00:46:29,353 --> 00:46:30,752
To see.
- Leave that.

606
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:33,422
How can you come to someone's
house just like that?

607
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,751
There must be some reason
behind that. Tell me?

608
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:37,221
Who is behind this?

609
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:41,086
Didn't you hear me?

610
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:43,323
On whose saying have

No one. Nothing like that.

612
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:49,339
Then are you mad?

613
00:46:56,446 --> 00:46:59,677
Boy! l'm not married till now.
Without that to have son?

614
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:02,852
No girl has ever come in my life.
Do you understand?

615
00:47:03,387 --> 00:47:05,947
Either you are mistaken or
someone has mislead you.

616
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:08,358
Don't waste your time here. You go.

617

Do you understand?- Yes.

625
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:57,901
My son. Nonsense.

626
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:08,245
These kind of frauds are happening a lot.

627
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:11,851
lf we get scared, it's over.
- l really got scared.

628
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:16,924
You have not seen the world. Common frauds
don't stand a chance in front of me.

629
00:48:17,127 --> 00:48:21,029
l have seen bigger frauds than this.
- What courage did that boy have!

630
00:48:21,632 --> 00:48:23,759
l think it was a case of mistaken identity.

631
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:28,368
There was a chance of my name
getting spoilt. Now that is over.

''The moon on the sky is in a hurry.''

635
00:48:40,484 --> 00:48:48,357
Hello. What is it, Pazhanisamy? Then?
How many plantain trees got spoilt?

636
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:54,290
Get some one to sleep there.
Make a bonfire or beat drums.

637
00:48:54,498 --> 00:48:58,127
That is how elephants are made to leave.

For that we'll have to take permission.

Why did you come again?
l had told you to take the lorry and leave.

644
00:49:44,348 --> 00:49:49,809
l didn't get any vehicle.
- You should have waited - l waited.

645
00:49:50,554 --> 00:49:52,522
Early morning a jeep
came with newspapers.

646
00:49:52,723 --> 00:49:54,418
The Jeep fellows..
- The Jeep fellows?

647

- Then?

651
00:50:06,403 --> 00:50:08,303
They all brought me here and left.

652
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:11,800
He has come to spoil my name.

653
00:50:12,042 --> 00:50:14,636
l must not see you in front of me.
Get lost. - Ajayan!

654
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:17,370
Get out.- Listen to what l'm saying.
- Go out.

655
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:22,712
Come here. Come. - Go.- Come this side.
Mother. - Come. Come here. - Get lost.

656
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:26,914
You come here. l'll tell you.
Getting angry won't help.

657
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:30,791
Last night you sent him in hurry.
Now some more people have come to know.

658
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:33,219
lf you shout, everyone will come to know.

659
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:35,557
For that reason should l keep silent
hearing all his lies?

660
00:50:35,832 --> 00:50:37,732
ls it enough to say that he is my son?
Shouldn't there be a proof? You!

661
00:50:37,934 --> 00:50:40,903
You come here. Keep quiet.
- Come here.- To where?

662
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:51,406
What is it?

663
00:50:54,851 --> 00:50:56,182
lsn't this your photo? - Yes, why?

664
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:59,913
When was this taken?
Some 18 years back.- ls it correct?

665
00:51:00,123 --> 00:51:02,421
Then what? - Come.

666
00:51:05,762 --> 00:51:07,593
Son. Show that photo.

667
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:24,770
His mother had this.
- Mother. Mother.

668
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:29,947
This is blackmailing. Blackmailing.
Where is your mother? Tell me.

669
00:51:30,153 --> 00:51:33,281
Mother!- Why are you hesitating?
Tell me. Where is your mother?

670
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:36,948
Mother?
- lt is 20 days since she died.

671
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:41,962
You...
- You can question him later.

672
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:44,893
He has traveled a lot and come here.

673
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:46,296
You go and have a bath.
Then we can eat something.

674
00:51:46,503 --> 00:51:49,131
Don't create unnecessary problems.
- You don't talk.

675
00:51:49,673 --> 00:51:51,300
Whether what he says is correct or not..

676
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:55,237
No one who has come searching
for us should return sad.

677
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:56,139
Come.

678
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:04,921
When?

679
00:52:23,373 --> 00:52:33,339
Central-TmG

680
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:48,361
What is your name?

681
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:53,196
You are from Tamil Nadu.
What is your name?- Karthik.

682
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:56,767
Karthik. Karthikeyan.
lt is Lord Muruga's name.

683
00:52:57,007 --> 00:53:01,205
Then he is a Hindu.
Where in Tamil Nadu?

684
00:53:02,546 --> 00:53:05,709
Brother. This place is very bad.

685
00:53:06,216 --> 00:53:10,710
Without any relation many people come here
saying that they are relatives.

686
00:53:11,154 --> 00:53:14,146
But no one returns in the same
form in which he comes.

687
00:53:14,824 --> 00:53:17,224
Last week one guy came searching for me.

688
00:53:17,427 --> 00:53:20,328
He said he was my uncle.
l gave him a kick.

689
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:25,258
He went back the way he came.
Ajayan is very close to me.

690
00:53:25,602 --> 00:53:28,571
He'll listen to whatever l say. Tell me.

691
00:53:28,939 --> 00:53:30,406
Why did you come here?

692
00:53:33,176 --> 00:53:36,077
What ever l have to say l'll tell it to the
concerned people. l don't want your help.

693
00:53:36,279 --> 00:53:37,473
Do you understand?

694
00:53:52,596 --> 00:53:56,430
l think this case will not be over so soon.

695
00:53:57,367 --> 00:53:59,426
Only you must say that with
your golden tongue.

696
00:53:59,803 --> 00:54:05,105
lf l tell, it is my tongue's fault.
Any one with wisdom will say this.

697
00:54:05,475 --> 00:54:07,773
l didn't think about him like this.

698
00:54:07,978 --> 00:54:11,277
How did you think of him?
- He is very thin, like a water snake.

699
00:54:11,481 --> 00:54:16,509
But he is a smart guy.
He has decided something and come.

700
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,278
Manietta. Don't get me scared.

701
00:54:18,488 --> 00:54:21,218
lf l ask you something..
..will you tell the truth?- Ask.

702
00:54:21,491 --> 00:54:24,619
What are you seeing here?
Go on that side.

703
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:28,391
l have told you not to stand
when men are talking.

704
00:54:28,832 --> 00:54:33,201
What a girl?
From the age of this boy if we see..

705
00:54:33,403 --> 00:54:37,134
lf we see?
- That time you were in Madras.

706
00:54:38,308 --> 00:54:40,970
l must have been there.

707
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:45,074
Unknowingly you might have
done a mistake..

708
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:46,806
Are you saying that this is a mistake?

709
00:54:47,017 --> 00:54:52,045
Maybe with some girl..
- Sister! lf l had anything, l won't be tensed.

710
00:54:52,422 --> 00:54:55,414
l promise on Guruvayoor Appan and Jesus.

711
00:54:55,859 --> 00:55:01,889
You think once more.
Your old butterfly days Maybe in those days..

712
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:04,660
Leave the butterfly alone.
There is not even a cockroach in my life.

713
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:09,438
l said all thatjust to show off.
- Maybe in sleep. - Sleep?

714
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:16,773
Hello. l told you Pazhanisamy.
Why are you constantly calling me?

715
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:19,538
lf elephant has come there.
Here a tiger has come.

716
00:55:19,716 --> 00:55:21,115
Put down the phone. You foolish idiot.

717
00:55:27,691 --> 00:55:30,683
You didn't take chutney.
- l don't want it.- Why?

718
00:55:30,894 --> 00:55:33,692
Don't you like chutney?
- l like Sambar with ldli.

719
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:40,092
When such nice Sambar is there
why make chutney?

720
00:55:40,303 --> 00:55:42,203
ldli and Sambar.
That is the combination.

721
00:55:47,577 --> 00:55:49,875
Keep the plate there.
- l'll wash it.

722
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,707
l'm used to all this in the hostel.

723
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:01,881
Give it to me.

724
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:07,227
Don't serve him too much and spoil him.

725
00:56:07,764 --> 00:56:11,996
Then he'll stay here. Let him
go back to the place he has come from, soon.

726
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:16,232
l don't feel what he says is a lie.

727
00:56:16,439 --> 00:56:19,408
Then is Ajayettan lying?
- To believe that is also difficult.

728
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:22,407
Aunt. Now you believe your own son.

729
00:56:22,779 --> 00:56:30,083
Till we know the truth let him stay here.
Our expense is that of little bit rice grain.

730
00:56:34,624 --> 00:56:36,751
That is the boy. See there.

731
00:56:43,633 --> 00:56:53,599
Central-TmG

732
00:57:00,316 --> 00:57:01,783
Who told you to wipe the car?

733
00:57:02,819 --> 00:57:06,277
lt was dirty.
- Why do you care if it is dirty?

734
00:57:06,656 --> 00:57:09,124
Don't try to be smart.
There are people to clean car here.

735
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:11,618
Don't take anything from
anyone without working.

736
00:57:11,828 --> 00:57:12,726
That's what my mother has taught me.

737
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:17,229
l ate food here.
- Mother felt sorry for you.

738
00:57:17,667 --> 00:57:20,295
That's why she gave you food. Not only you,
whoever comes here hungry will get food.

739
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:21,968
You need not take that as your right.

740
00:57:22,172 --> 00:57:25,300
Sunanda. Come here.
- He is cleaning the car.

741
00:57:25,675 --> 00:57:27,074
When did he become a
member of this place?

742
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:29,404
He is the type who shouldn't be
given place to stick needle.

743
00:57:29,746 --> 00:57:31,646
lf this goes on, tomorrow he'll demand that..

744
00:57:31,848 --> 00:57:33,475
..this house and properties
should be transferred to his name.

745
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:49,591
Where are you going with the bag?
- l'm leaving.

746
00:57:51,701 --> 00:57:55,000
Listening to her nonsense?
- Not only that..

747
00:57:55,538 --> 00:57:58,507
l'm becoming a problem to everyone here.

748
00:57:59,709 --> 00:58:02,177
Till death my mother has not
troubled my father.

749
00:58:02,378 --> 00:58:07,111
She didn't even tell him that
he has a son. Now l am.

750
00:58:07,851 --> 00:58:11,116
Look here. l'm the one
who is the decision maker here.

751
00:58:11,621 --> 00:58:15,682
lf you must leave, l'll tell.
You came here as Ajayan's son.

752
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:18,189
That means you are my grandson.

753
00:58:18,928 --> 00:58:22,193
Just think that your
grandma is speaking. Don't go.

754
00:58:22,398 --> 00:58:26,129
Ammukutty Amma.
Your cow is running astray.- My God.

755
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:34,041
Sunanda, go run and catch her.

756
00:58:34,244 --> 00:58:35,973
lf it runs into the paddy fields,
it will destroy the crop.

757
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:37,203
l'll go and catch it.

758
00:58:41,084 --> 00:58:50,117
Stop there. l told you to stop. Stop!

759
00:58:53,096 --> 00:58:54,154
Come here.

760
00:59:03,606 --> 00:59:05,233
You take a day's leave and come.

761
00:59:06,943 --> 00:59:09,468
Balan. Would you not take leave,
if theirs is an emergency in your house?

762
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:15,911
Things are not simple as you think.
Mother has adopted him as her grandson.

763
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:17,743
She is not believing what l say.

764
00:59:19,122 --> 00:59:22,250
lf we complain at the local police station,
it will become a big issue.

765
00:59:22,458 --> 00:59:25,825
There will be court, advocate,
and a case. ln this way, except police,

766
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,261
nobody will know and things will move.

767
00:59:29,132 --> 00:59:32,761
The circle inspector will agree.
Don't forget what l said.

768
00:59:32,936 --> 00:59:37,566
Uniform, jeep. Okay? Come.

769
00:59:45,648 --> 00:59:47,115
This is the order from Mannothi.

770
00:59:50,553 --> 00:59:54,182
Ajayetta. Why are butterflies not found
in our place like before?

771
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:56,051
ls it because flower is not there or
because the nectar is not there?

772
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:58,621
That is because we spray medicines.

773
01:00:01,464 --> 01:00:02,692
Do you want to see butterflies?
- No.

774
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:04,460
l'll show butterflies to you.
- No need.

775
01:00:04,667 --> 01:00:06,464
l'll show butterflies to you.
- What madness is this?

776
01:00:06,669 --> 01:00:07,966
He wants to see a butterfly.

777
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:18,977
Keep that on one side.

778
01:00:19,182 --> 01:00:22,310
l'll do that.
- Just pluck the right one.

779
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:26,479
Wonderful. l'm seeing it for the first time.

780
01:00:27,357 --> 01:00:29,757
Haven't you seen a gourd?
- l have seen it.

781
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:32,993
ln Salem l stayed in a
uncle Shakeran's house.

782
01:00:33,196 --> 01:00:34,993
Every morning he drank gourd juice..

783
01:00:35,198 --> 01:00:38,827
..that is bought from the market.
l have not seen a garden like this before.

784
01:00:41,537 --> 01:00:45,997
Who is this uncle Shakeran?
- He is a parcel lorry driver there.

785
01:00:46,609 --> 01:00:48,338
He and his two children are there.

786
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:51,012
From the time school closes to the time
it reopens l stay with him.

787
01:00:52,215 --> 01:00:54,683
Did you do your studies in Salem?

788
01:00:55,585 --> 01:00:56,916
From LKG onwards l am there.

789
01:00:57,687 --> 01:01:00,713
Why your mother has not taken you
with her to Madras?

790
01:01:01,791 --> 01:01:05,591
She never used to.
lnitially l used to cry.

791
01:01:05,895 --> 01:01:08,693
Then l realized that she may be
having some problem.

792
01:01:08,898 --> 01:01:10,695
l didn't want to trouble her.
So l never asked her.

793
01:01:11,067 --> 01:01:13,365
Doesn't this uncle Shakeran
know what the problem was?

794
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:26,880
Uncle Shakeran's house was the
third one in which mother made me stay.

795
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:29,384
No one knows my mother's past.

796
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:35,722
She'll daily call me in the hostel.
lf my voice quivers, she'll come running.

797
01:01:35,992 --> 01:01:38,893
Then she'll stay with me for some days.
She'll take me for an outing.

798
01:01:39,095 --> 01:01:41,063
Then she'll leave me in the hostel and go.

799
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:44,895
After tenth grade exams she had told me
she'll come and take me.

800
01:01:45,101 --> 01:01:48,901
To go to Chennai. l had packed everything.
l had bid goodbye to my friends.

801
01:01:49,105 --> 01:01:51,539
l was waiting for her. But..

802
01:01:55,745 --> 01:01:57,713
Do big boys cry like this?

803
01:01:58,047 --> 01:02:00,345
Come, we have lot of work to do.

804
01:02:01,117 --> 01:02:08,080
What a shame.
Big boys should never cry.

805
01:03:01,677 --> 01:03:08,139
Come. Come. On the top,
to your left. Be careful.

806
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:25,999
There are two vessels.
Which do you want?

807
01:03:26,202 --> 01:03:27,260
The small one is enough.

808
01:03:39,782 --> 01:03:41,249
Whose guitar is this?

809
01:03:41,551 --> 01:03:46,955
That is Ajayan's. Once in a mood he bought it.
Now he doesn't use it.

810
01:03:47,557 --> 01:03:49,684
Shall l use it? - You try it.

811
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:05,535
Do you know how to play this?
- A little bit.

812
01:04:05,908 --> 01:04:07,705
Every weekend there used
to be music class in school.

They teach guitar, violin
and everything else.

You sing like just Ajayan.

815
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:37,730
Earlier he used to sing when l used
to be sad to make me happy.

He used to walk behind me and sing.

He came just now. Sit.

There is no time to sit, sir. Bala!

848
01:10:01,764 --> 01:10:03,664
He is having a bath. He'll come.- Okay.

849
01:10:04,433 --> 01:10:05,832
Have you finished writing alphabet?

850
01:10:07,469 --> 01:10:09,733
Give it to me. Let me see.

851
01:10:16,946 --> 01:10:17,810
What is the matter?

852
01:10:21,283 --> 01:10:23,979
Grandfather.
What is the meaning of conman?

853
01:10:24,153 --> 01:10:25,882
lt's a phrase.

854
01:10:26,088 --> 01:10:30,320
ln front of others they'll act decent.
ln reality he'll be a fraud.

855
01:10:30,526 --> 01:10:33,825
Those people are called as Pagal Manyan.

856
01:10:38,267 --> 01:10:39,256
Now you write one, two, three till hundred.

857
01:10:39,468 --> 01:10:41,197
Come. Let's sit inside and talk.

858
01:10:41,403 --> 01:10:43,428
lt won't be proper if we talk inside.

859
01:10:43,839 --> 01:10:44,771
Listen to me.

860
01:10:56,885 --> 01:10:58,750
He is near the cowshed.

861
01:11:00,356 --> 01:11:02,756
Cut it from that side.
- Okay.

862
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:09,456
Bala!

863
01:11:09,665 --> 01:11:11,292
How come you have come in this dress?

864
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:12,262
Come here.

865
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:15,869
l'm telling you to come here.

866
01:11:28,884 --> 01:11:29,816
Stand on this side.

867
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:36,190
So you are the boy?
How many frauds have you done?

868
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:38,555
Scoundrel! Can't you hear what l said?

869
01:11:38,761 --> 01:11:40,991
To how many houses
have you gone saying this?

870
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:45,393
l have not..
- Tell me where is your head quarters?

871
01:11:47,069 --> 01:11:48,696
Where were you before this?
- Salem.

872
01:11:48,904 --> 01:11:50,769
You told me Chennai.
- That is Chennai..

873
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:52,167
How can you keep saying like this?

874
01:11:52,374 --> 01:11:54,342
That time he came from Chennai.
That's all.

875
01:11:54,543 --> 01:11:56,977
He studied and grew up in Salem.
- Mom, you keep quiet.

876
01:11:57,179 --> 01:11:59,010
Let the police question him.
- You keep quiet.

877
01:11:59,214 --> 01:12:01,239
How many were there
in your gang in Salem?

878
01:12:01,450 --> 01:12:03,748
No one.
- Did you plan this fraud single-handedly?

879
01:12:03,952 --> 01:12:06,147
Bala! There is nothing fraud.
- Mom! You keep quiet.

880
01:12:06,355 --> 01:12:07,686
Police have come after
finding out everything.

881
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:10,017
Let him answer the questions.
Why are you interfering?

882
01:12:10,225 --> 01:12:11,385
To which place does your mother belong?

883
01:12:11,593 --> 01:12:12,116
Amma.
- That..

884
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:14,421
You keep quiet.
- What are you thinking?

885
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:19,693
Don't try to act smart. Tell the truth.

886
01:12:19,902 --> 01:12:22,370
Did you think the people here are fools?

887
01:12:22,571 --> 01:12:24,937
Have you ever got police beating?
l'll hit you.

888
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:25,606
Don't do anything.

889
01:12:25,808 --> 01:12:27,332
Mom! You keep quiet.

890
01:12:28,043 --> 01:12:29,476
He'll not tell the truth here.

891
01:12:29,678 --> 01:12:31,578
l'll beat him in the lock up.
He'll tell the truth.

892
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:34,010
Get in. Get in the jeep.

893
01:12:36,919 --> 01:12:41,117
Get out. Get out from here.
Police has come.

894
01:12:41,323 --> 01:12:44,690
This is my house.
l'll make whoever l like stay here.

895
01:12:44,893 --> 01:12:47,123
Who are you to ask? Get out.

896
01:12:50,332 --> 01:12:51,890
Mom, Don't the police have to do its duty?

897
01:12:52,101 --> 01:12:54,535
ls it his duty to threaten an innocent boy?

898
01:12:54,737 --> 01:12:56,500
You can do all that in your station.

899
01:12:56,705 --> 01:13:00,163
lf we have any complaint,
we'll lodge it in the station.

900
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:02,810
A big inspector has come.
- What is this, mother?

901
01:13:03,011 --> 01:13:04,069
Get lost.

902
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:06,814
Give way.
- No problem. You go once more.

903
01:13:06,915 --> 01:13:09,383
Don't talk.
Don't call me for this any more.

904
01:13:09,585 --> 01:13:11,143
Say it once more.
- Get lost.

905
01:13:13,021 --> 01:13:14,648
Bala!
- l told you to shut up.

906
01:13:24,633 --> 01:13:34,599
Central-TmG

907
01:13:47,723 --> 01:13:51,921
Why are you upset?
lt is not that l don't trust you.

908
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:55,028
As far as l know he is a poor boy.

909
01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:57,755
A boy who doesn't have a mother
or any one else.

910
01:13:57,966 --> 01:14:01,231
As you said he must have got mistaken.

911
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:04,964
Till we know that, should we trouble him?

912
01:14:09,011 --> 01:14:12,708
Do you remember?
Once on a rainy day like this,

913
01:14:12,915 --> 01:14:15,509
we heard the sound of a puppy
on this door step.

914
01:14:15,717 --> 01:14:20,347
Someone had deserted him.
You gave him milk and rice.

915
01:14:20,556 --> 01:14:24,219
For how long it stayed
in this house like a member?

916
01:14:26,528 --> 01:14:30,191
Then there was a little parrot.
You fed it too.

917
01:14:30,399 --> 01:14:33,061
You made a cage for it
and kept it with us for so long.

918
01:14:33,268 --> 01:14:34,997
Can't you think of this also like that?

919
01:14:35,204 --> 01:14:38,230
Till we know the truth, let him stay here.

920
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:44,078
Come and eat.

921
01:14:46,682 --> 01:14:47,671
Karthi!

922
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:50,478
Karthik!

923
01:14:52,621 --> 01:14:53,849
Why are you sitting here?

924
01:14:54,056 --> 01:14:58,516
Come and eat something.
- No need. l'm not hungry.

925
01:14:58,727 --> 01:15:02,993
Are you angry with Ajayan?
Don't be so innocent.

926
01:15:03,198 --> 01:15:06,395
Parents will scold children.
Sometimes they will beat.

927
01:15:06,602 --> 01:15:08,365
This happens in all the households.

928
01:15:09,838 --> 01:15:13,433
You are so scared.
That is why every one is creating trouble.

929
01:15:13,642 --> 01:15:19,103
Be brave and smart.
Try to get his love.

930
01:15:19,314 --> 01:15:21,839
lt is your grandmother who is saying so.
Everything will be fine.

931
01:15:30,759 --> 01:15:32,522
Have you filled the diesel?
- Yes.

932
01:15:33,262 --> 01:15:35,287
l'll come back and call you.
Then you can come and take the vehicle.

933
01:15:35,497 --> 01:15:37,556
lf you want l'll come.
- No need. Give the key.

934
01:15:41,603 --> 01:15:44,299
Have you started?
- Yes.

935
01:15:45,073 --> 01:15:46,131
When will you come?

936
01:15:46,341 --> 01:15:49,970
When l feel like.
- Attapadi is not in the Himalayas.

937
01:15:50,178 --> 01:15:52,078
lf you don't come back in two days,
l'll come there.

938
01:15:52,281 --> 01:15:55,717
''lt is in love. lt is in desire.,''

939
01:15:55,918 --> 01:15:57,647
l told you l'm starting, Pazhanisamy.

940
01:15:57,853 --> 01:15:59,252
Why are you nagging me?

941
01:15:59,454 --> 01:16:02,150
l'll throw the phone in the jungle.
Scoundrel.

942
01:16:02,891 --> 01:16:06,827
Come, come. Get in fast.

943
01:17:14,997 --> 01:17:20,230
''lt is in love. lt is in desire..''

944
01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:23,934
Look here. You idiot!

945
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:39,414
Are you fine?
- Yes.

946
01:17:39,621 --> 01:17:41,384
Didn't you eat properly?
- l ate.

947
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:43,455
Saplings are there in gunny
bags at the back, Get it.

948
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:44,557
Okay, sir.

949
01:17:46,795 --> 01:17:50,287
What happened? What happened?
- Sir. Sir.

950
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:55,095
How did you come in this?
- Grandma told me to.

951
01:17:55,303 --> 01:17:56,327
Whoever might have told you.

952
01:17:56,538 --> 01:17:59,006
Why did you get in my vehicle
without my permission?

953
01:18:00,208 --> 01:18:03,507
Why the hell did you come here?

954
01:18:03,712 --> 01:18:07,443
Grandma told me to go with you
and look at all the places.

955
01:18:08,817 --> 01:18:11,445
Pazhanisamy! l'll go and come later.

956
01:18:12,587 --> 01:18:13,986
Sir, it is not possible.
- Why?

957
01:18:14,189 --> 01:18:16,350
Today only the Pollachi people
are coming to buy the bananas.

958
01:18:16,558 --> 01:18:19,584
Forest officer will be there only today.
l told him you'll be coming.

959
01:18:19,795 --> 01:18:22,491
Or else to make fence and get letter
we'll have to go to Trivandrum.

960
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:24,359
lf fence is not built, will elephant come?

961
01:18:24,566 --> 01:18:27,296
Will the tiger come?
Will the bear eat everything? Get lost.

962
01:18:28,170 --> 01:18:29,797
lt is my bad luck.

963
01:18:30,105 --> 01:18:31,663
l don't understand anything.

964
01:18:32,641 --> 01:18:34,438
Who are you?
- My father.

965
01:18:34,643 --> 01:18:36,042
Father?

l saw rice and things here.
lt was since so long. He was not seen it.

976
01:20:54,049 --> 01:20:55,880
lnstead of sitting idle l thought l'll cook it.

977
01:21:04,025 --> 01:21:06,789
How did you learn all this?
- That l learnt..

978
01:21:06,995 --> 01:21:08,462
Smart fellow.

979
01:21:14,669 --> 01:21:15,966
Best, Best. Best..

980
01:21:16,404 --> 01:21:17,837
Jackfruit seeds have been cooked the best.

981
01:21:18,039 --> 01:21:19,973
From where did you get it?
Has some one started a new hotel?

982
01:21:20,175 --> 01:21:23,201
Hotel? This was cooked by Karthik.

983
01:21:24,579 --> 01:21:25,773
Take this water.

984
01:21:34,789 --> 01:21:37,383
Sir, it is your luck that you got a son like this.

985
01:21:37,592 --> 01:21:38,991
l have 3-4 in my house.

986
01:21:39,227 --> 01:21:41,161
lf you tell them to come here,
they'll go there.

987
01:21:42,130 --> 01:21:46,089
Shall l pour Sambar?
- Go away. Go.

988
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:04,600
Akkapali.

989
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:08,236
What is this he has written?

990
01:24:14,282 --> 01:24:15,214
Pazhanisamy!

991
01:24:16,084 --> 01:24:18,644
He has gone home.
- Whose permission did he take?

992
01:24:18,853 --> 01:24:21,754
l'm here today. He asked me
whether he can come tomorrow.

993
01:24:21,956 --> 01:24:23,719
l said yes.

994
01:24:25,193 --> 01:24:26,820
ls it time to bring the other thing?

995
01:24:27,796 --> 01:24:31,562
What other thing?
- The medicine.

996
01:24:31,766 --> 01:24:33,427
The one that you drink when you come here.

997
01:24:36,905 --> 01:24:39,840
Pazhanisamy told me to give it to you.
Shall l bring it?

998
01:24:49,150 --> 01:24:51,311
Pazhnisamy told me that grandma
doesn't know about this.

999
01:24:51,519 --> 01:24:52,781
l'll not tell her.

1000
01:24:58,660 --> 01:24:59,752
Pickle.

1001
01:25:10,505 --> 01:25:12,700
Why are you punishing me like this?

1002
01:25:12,907 --> 01:25:14,875
What harm have l done to you?
Tell me?

1003
01:25:18,913 --> 01:25:22,212
l'm not able to hold my head high
in front of my mother.

1004
01:25:22,884 --> 01:25:27,082
My mother became alone when
l was 2 and1/2 years old.

1005
01:25:27,288 --> 01:25:28,778
From that time we have been
suffering hardship.

1006
01:25:28,990 --> 01:25:31,322
We were thrown out of the rented house.
We starved.

1007
01:25:31,526 --> 01:25:33,221
No one was there to help us.

1008
01:25:34,996 --> 01:25:35,758
After tenth grade.

1009
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:39,161
l wanted to go to college and study.
l could not manage.

1010
01:25:39,367 --> 01:25:41,631
My mother didn't have that much money.

1011
01:25:41,836 --> 01:25:43,133
That's why l went out of state.

1012
01:25:43,771 --> 01:25:46,797
There is no job that l have not done
in Madras and Mumbai. Do you know?

1013
01:25:52,046 --> 01:25:55,880
l have worked as a supplier in hotel.
l have driven a taxi.

1014
01:25:56,184 --> 01:25:58,482
Due to a blessing l went to Gulf.

1015
01:26:00,522 --> 01:26:03,320
From the money l earned there
l bought all this.

1016
01:26:03,691 --> 01:26:05,886
To come to my place
and stay with my mother.

1017
01:26:06,094 --> 01:26:09,325
To give my mother peace and
happiness for the rest of her life.

1018
01:26:09,531 --> 01:26:13,228
That was my only wish.
l never married.

1019
01:26:13,434 --> 01:26:15,129
l didn't want any responsibility, that's why.

1020
01:26:15,336 --> 01:26:18,931
That's when like atom bomb you came.
l'll not give up.

1021
01:26:22,977 --> 01:26:27,880
l lost my peace of mind.
My mother doesn't believe me.

1022
01:26:28,483 --> 01:26:31,077
l got dishonored in front of everyone.
Are you happy?

1023
01:26:32,754 --> 01:26:36,281
The nearer to death the knot tightens.
That's what you are.

1024
01:26:39,294 --> 01:26:44,527
Why have you come as my death?
Go away some where.

1025
01:26:55,009 --> 01:26:55,805
Sir.

1026
01:26:56,611 --> 01:26:57,737
Sir.

1027
01:26:59,547 --> 01:27:01,242
Sir.
We got cheated.

1028
01:27:01,683 --> 01:27:03,810
Sir. Sir.

1029
01:27:06,921 --> 01:27:12,860
Sir. Get up.
Get up fast. Sir. Sir.

1030
01:27:13,061 --> 01:27:17,191
What happened?
- Elephants have come.

1031
01:27:17,398 --> 01:27:20,265
lt has damaged 2-3 houses.
Thrown away the kids.

1032
01:27:20,468 --> 01:27:22,231
lt has come near our garden.
- Okay.

1033
01:27:22,437 --> 01:27:23,426
Where is the boy?

1034
01:27:23,638 --> 01:27:24,662
You go and see.

1035
01:27:25,473 --> 01:27:26,599
Karthi!

1036
01:27:30,278 --> 01:27:31,609
He is not here.

1037
01:27:46,761 --> 01:27:47,284
What happened?

1038
01:27:47,528 --> 01:27:49,257
Don't go there. Elephant! Elephant!

1039
01:27:49,430 --> 01:27:49,759
Karthik!

1040
01:27:49,964 --> 01:27:51,932
We saw the boy going that way.
We called him.

1041
01:27:52,133 --> 01:27:53,031
He didn't listen.
There are lots of elephants there.

1042
01:27:53,735 --> 01:27:55,896
Come.
Sir. Don't go. Don't go.

1043
01:27:56,104 --> 01:27:59,164
There are lots of elephants. Don't go.

Are you sitting here?
- Photo.

1047
01:29:24,025 --> 01:29:25,515
Photo. Nonsense.

What were you doing?

1094

l got both these as a prize
on a speech competition.

1103
01:34:51,285 --> 01:34:53,378
Do you do only speech and play?
Don't you study?

1104
01:34:53,587 --> 01:34:57,216
Sister. What do you think of me?
ln the second term l got 92%.

1105
01:34:57,425 --> 01:34:59,325
You need 8% more to reach 100%.

1106
01:34:59,527 --> 01:35:01,586
l don't aim so high.

1107
01:35:02,296 --> 01:35:05,026
Do you come to church to
talk to indecent people?

1108
01:35:05,232 --> 01:35:06,699
Just go on..

1109
01:35:09,737 --> 01:35:12,137
Father. Wait there.

01:35:12,339 --> 01:35:15,035
l live decently with the person l love.

1111
01:35:15,242 --> 01:35:17,642
ls that indecency?
Now l'm happier than l was with you.

1112
01:35:17,845 --> 01:35:21,110
Even if l have any problem,
l'll not come to you for help.

1113
01:35:21,315 --> 01:35:24,876
Stop it. Useless.
Are you talking nonsense in front of father?

1114
01:35:25,086 --> 01:35:26,713
l'll break your teeth.
- Mother. You come.

1115
01:35:26,921 --> 01:35:27,888
People are watching.

1116
01:35:28,089 --> 01:35:30,216
While talking have decency..
- Come, father.

1117
01:35:45,406 --> 01:35:46,373
Take it.

1118
01:35:48,843 --> 01:35:50,970

01:35:51,612 --> 01:35:52,476
ls it her lover?

1120
01:35:53,013 --> 01:35:55,811
There marriage is fixed.
Will l allow it otherwise?

1121
01:35:58,018 --> 01:35:59,542
Don't do it.
Your hands will get spoilt.

1122
01:35:59,754 --> 01:36:01,551
they will get clean if wiped.

1123
01:36:04,625 --> 01:36:08,493
You lived in Tamil Nadu, then how come you
speak such good Malayalam?

1124
01:36:09,096 --> 01:36:11,223
Mom used to talk only in Malayalam.

1125
01:36:11,432 --> 01:36:14,424
ln vacation with whom
l stayed were Malayalees.

1126
01:36:15,469 --> 01:36:17,937
Was your mother beautiful?

1127
01:36:18,506 --> 01:36:22,203
That l don't know.
- Why?

1128
01:36:22,409 --> 01:36:24,502
On seeing a person won't you know
whether she is beautiful or not?

1129
01:36:26,514 --> 01:36:29,574
l used to like mom's talk and smile.

1130
01:36:30,017 --> 01:36:32,485
Will you be angry if l tell you one thing?
- What?

1131
01:36:32,686 --> 01:36:36,087
When l see you sometimes
l remember my mother.

1132
01:36:37,324 --> 01:36:38,518
ls she like me?

1133
01:36:39,794 --> 01:36:43,821
Not in looks. But there are
some resemblances.

1134
01:36:44,098 --> 01:36:46,191
ln the end will you end up
calling me as mother?

1135
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:47,799
No.

1136
01:36:51,672 --> 01:36:52,263
Shall l go?

1137
01:36:52,473 --> 01:36:54,202

01:37:18,465 --> 01:37:20,399
Ajayettan. Mom enquired about you.

1141
01:37:20,601 --> 01:37:21,829
She asked why you don't come there.

1142
01:37:22,036 --> 01:37:25,802
Tell her l went out of station.
- ln this range you'll have to leave.

1143
01:37:26,006 --> 01:37:30,136
Your behavior has changed.
Your usual jovial attitude is gone.

1144
01:37:30,344 --> 01:37:33,074
Are you going to the company?
Go and do the work there.

1145
01:37:33,380 --> 01:37:37,077
l'm talking seriously.
Why are you being so adamant?

1146
01:37:37,284 --> 01:37:38,683
lt was a mistake which happened long back.

1147
01:37:38,886 --> 01:37:42,378
Can't you accept that?
- l told you not to interfere in my matters.

1148
01:37:42,590 --> 01:37:45,684
Don't be angry.
God will forgive one mistake.

1149
01:37:45,893 --> 01:37:49,021
lf you don't use the opportunity you
get to set that right, that's sin.

1150
01:37:49,230 --> 01:37:50,720
You know what you are saying?

1151
01:37:50,931 --> 01:37:54,298
lf you tell a lie 100 times,
it'll sound true. lt is a feeling.

1152
01:37:54,501 --> 01:37:56,492
A person should not be punished for that.

1153
01:37:56,704 --> 01:37:58,604
All of you are attacking me
by rounding me up.

1154
01:37:58,806 --> 01:38:00,205
There is a limit to tolerate that.

1155
01:38:00,407 --> 01:38:02,932
lf not today, tomorrow you'll understand
who made a mistake.

1156
01:38:03,143 --> 01:38:04,303
That time you won't be able
to take back these words.

1157
01:38:04,511 --> 01:38:06,911
Do you understand? You have
come to advise me. Get lost.

1158
01:38:23,998 --> 01:38:25,295
Slightly this way.

1159
01:38:26,267 --> 01:38:27,632
Like that.

1160
01:38:32,006 --> 01:38:33,030
lt is nice.

1161
01:38:39,947 --> 01:38:42,472
Now you keep the hand on shoulder.
- That's not needed.

1162
01:38:42,683 --> 01:38:45,652
Keep it.
- What for?

1163
01:38:46,754 --> 01:38:47,880
Rose. Come here.

1164
01:38:48,088 --> 01:38:49,680
We both will get photographed, together.

1165
01:38:49,890 --> 01:38:52,085
No need. - Come

1166
01:38:55,796 --> 01:38:59,027
When he passed tenth grade,
his mother got this.

1167
01:38:59,233 --> 01:39:02,327
A film is not required.
We can see it the moment it is taken.

1168
01:39:02,536 --> 01:39:03,730
Take us together.

1169
01:39:08,976 --> 01:39:10,773
Let me see.
- Here.

1170
01:39:11,979 --> 01:39:13,879
Which class are you in now?
- ln tenth grade.

1171
01:39:14,081 --> 01:39:17,209
She is very good in studies.
She always comes first.

1172
01:39:17,418 --> 01:39:19,477
She is saying just like that.
- Take her single photo.

1173
01:39:19,687 --> 01:39:21,518
No need. - Wait.

1174
01:39:23,791 --> 01:39:25,725
Which subject do you like?
- Mathematic.

1175
01:39:25,926 --> 01:39:27,860
That is my favorite as well.

1176
01:39:29,697 --> 01:39:30,686
Let me see.

1177
01:39:31,699 --> 01:39:34,293
You are really beautiful. See.

1178
01:39:34,902 --> 01:39:36,802
Here. Do you like it?

1179
01:39:47,014 --> 01:39:48,777
Jesus.

1180
01:39:53,787 --> 01:39:54,811
Go, crow.

1181
01:39:55,389 --> 01:39:59,758
Come here.
Crows are waiting to take the copra.

1182
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:02,986
l have to study.
- Why can't you sit here and study?

1183
01:40:03,197 --> 01:40:05,597
Come here.
- This mother..

1184
01:40:05,799 --> 01:40:09,394
When the crow comes,
show like this with the mirror.

1185
01:40:09,603 --> 01:40:10,797
Come here.

1186
01:40:16,243 --> 01:40:26,209
Central-TmG

1187
01:40:37,698 --> 01:40:38,596
l'll hit you.

1188
01:40:45,205 --> 01:40:46,763
My Jesus.

1189
01:40:48,976 --> 01:40:50,603
Bring your ear here.

1190
01:40:51,445 --> 01:40:53,606
Shouldn't we make that boy
go away from here?

1191
01:40:53,814 --> 01:40:56,374
l'm trying my level best.
lt is not working out.

1192
01:40:56,583 --> 01:40:59,643
lt is possible. l have
come up with an idea.

1193
01:40:59,853 --> 01:41:03,186
My mother is smitten by him.
No matter what we say she won't believe it.

1194
01:41:03,390 --> 01:41:06,450
What if he takes away some money
of your mother and runs away?

1195
01:41:08,028 --> 01:41:10,519
He won't. Money is not his aim.

1196
01:41:10,731 --> 01:41:13,097
Ammukutty Amma should feel
that he was behind money.

1197
01:41:13,300 --> 01:41:15,791
That is the idea l'm going
to tell you. Come near.

1198
01:41:18,205 --> 01:41:22,164
ln front of mom you give him
some money for some work.

1199
01:41:22,376 --> 01:41:26,244
When he doesn't come back
mom will know he is a fraud.

1200
01:41:26,447 --> 01:41:27,744
All the problems will be over.

1201
01:41:27,948 --> 01:41:29,813
What do you mean that
he will not come back?

1202
01:41:30,017 --> 01:41:31,245
Not to kill him.

1203
01:41:31,452 --> 01:41:33,977
We'll make him understand the matter.

1204
01:41:34,188 --> 01:41:35,917
For that we have people.

1205
01:41:37,157 --> 01:41:38,146
Will it backfire?

1206
01:41:38,358 --> 01:41:39,347
Nothing will happen.

1207
01:41:39,560 --> 01:41:42,996
He'll go to Salem or Madras and live happily.
lsn't that enough?

1208
01:41:43,197 --> 01:41:48,294
''lt is in love. Over that
in desire as well.''

1209
01:41:48,502 --> 01:41:50,231
Keep it. You idiot.

1210
01:41:55,976 --> 01:41:57,773
Remove water and spread.
- Okay.

1211
01:41:59,213 --> 01:42:00,942
Will you go to town? - Okay.

1212
01:42:01,148 --> 01:42:02,547
Deposit this money in the bank.

1213
01:42:02,749 --> 01:42:04,614
You give him some job like that.

1214
01:42:04,818 --> 01:42:06,445
Then you don't need
to run for everything.

1215
01:42:06,653 --> 01:42:07,881
There is lot of money.

1216
01:42:08,088 --> 01:42:10,420
Can you take it carefully? - Okay.

1217
01:42:11,091 --> 01:42:14,083
First you go with him and explain everything.
Then later he'll go alone.

1218
01:42:14,294 --> 01:42:16,057
l don't have the time.
That is why l'm telling him.

1219
01:42:16,263 --> 01:42:16,888
l'll do it.

1220
01:42:17,097 --> 01:42:21,898
There is Rs. 25,000.
This is for your expense.

1221
01:42:22,136 --> 01:42:25,105
Here is the bank address
and the account number.

1222
01:42:25,305 --> 01:42:27,671
Do you hear me? Take it.

1223
01:42:27,875 --> 01:42:30,537
Will you carry it carefully?
- l'll go.

1224
01:42:41,722 --> 01:42:43,212
Do you want an auto?
- No need.

1225
01:42:43,423 --> 01:42:44,014
l'm going to the town.

1226
01:42:44,224 --> 01:42:44,918
l'll go in a bus.

1227
01:42:45,125 --> 01:42:46,990
Give me the bus fare.
l'm also going to town.

1228
01:42:47,194 --> 01:42:48,718
l just want company.

1229
01:42:51,198 --> 01:42:53,462
Get in. l didn't want to
take the auto empty.

1230
01:42:53,667 --> 01:42:54,634
Okay.

1231
01:43:11,885 --> 01:43:13,682
Why did you turn here?
- This is a shortcut.

1232
01:43:13,887 --> 01:43:15,320
We can reach soon.

1233
01:43:31,271 --> 01:43:33,000
What happened?
- Get down.

1234
01:43:41,448 --> 01:43:51,414
Central-TmG

1235
01:44:03,370 --> 01:44:08,899
What is it? Who are you?
- We have come to give you advise.

1236
01:44:10,644 --> 01:44:13,272
Did you scared?
- Yes.

1237
01:44:16,650 --> 01:44:18,117
Did you see this place?

1238
01:44:18,318 --> 01:44:20,616
How much ever you scream,
no one will be able to hear it.

1239
01:44:20,821 --> 01:44:23,289
Even if we kill you and throw you in jungle,
you'll lie there.

1240
01:44:23,490 --> 01:44:28,951
No one will know. So it is good for
you if you do what we say.

1241
01:44:32,332 --> 01:44:33,390
My mother.

1242
01:44:34,668 --> 01:44:35,498
Stop there.

1243
01:44:43,377 --> 01:44:44,401
Wait.

1244
01:44:55,656 --> 01:44:57,089
My mother.

1245
01:44:58,659 --> 01:44:59,591
Stop there.

1246
01:45:05,065 --> 01:45:06,464
Hair, hair.

1247
01:45:10,103 --> 01:45:14,540
Wait there. Wait.

1248
01:45:24,851 --> 01:45:26,876
Don't bite.

1249
01:45:32,726 --> 01:45:33,750
Don't beat.

1250
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:35,985
Let us talk.

1251
01:45:39,433 --> 01:45:43,130
Don't hit him. Don't kill him.
Listen to us.

1252
01:45:47,174 --> 01:45:50,405
My leg. - My leg.

1253
01:45:50,610 --> 01:45:53,135
We won't do anything.

1254
01:45:54,548 --> 01:45:56,778
This boy is mad. Run.

1255
01:45:58,085 --> 01:45:59,313
lf you don't want to get
hurt and die, run.

1256
01:45:59,519 --> 01:46:00,918
My back.

1257
01:46:04,591 --> 01:46:05,683
Don't hit.

1258
01:46:05,892 --> 01:46:09,384
What throw is this?

1259
01:46:11,164 --> 01:46:13,496
My mother.

1260
01:46:14,634 --> 01:46:15,293
Get in.

1261
01:46:15,502 --> 01:46:19,097
Don't throw it. My mother.

1262
01:46:19,506 --> 01:46:20,598
Go fast.

1263
01:46:31,585 --> 01:46:36,784
''lt is in love. Moreover
there is desire as well.''

1264
01:46:37,391 --> 01:46:39,291
Hello.
- lt is me.

1265
01:46:40,060 --> 01:46:43,518
Come to city hospital
soon with some money.

1266
01:46:43,730 --> 01:46:48,133
l have only eight stitches on my head.
Three of them are in the lCU.

1267
01:46:48,335 --> 01:46:51,133
That boy is not an ordinary boy.

1268
01:47:02,015 --> 01:47:05,007
l told you before itself not to send him alone.

1269
01:47:05,218 --> 01:47:08,187
Some people tried to snatch his money.

1270
01:47:08,388 --> 01:47:10,481
Guruvayoor Appan saved my kid.

1271
01:47:10,690 --> 01:47:12,248
We must go to Guruvayoor
tomorrow itself.

1272
01:47:12,459 --> 01:47:15,155
l have wished to do a
prayer with a banana.

1273
01:47:24,604 --> 01:47:25,571
Pass book.

1274
01:47:29,443 --> 01:47:31,673
l have deposited the money in bank.

1275
01:47:33,380 --> 01:47:34,176
Wait.

1276
01:47:39,519 --> 01:47:43,785
Have you learnt fighting?
- l have not studied it. But if required..

1277
01:47:43,990 --> 01:47:46,254
You can manage.
- Yes.

1278
01:48:00,507 --> 01:48:02,065
Wait. We'll also come.

1279
01:48:02,976 --> 01:48:07,174
To where? - To Guruvayoor,
Shouldn't we fulfill the prayer?

1280
01:48:07,380 --> 01:48:10,144
You drop us at bus stand.
- The car has gone for repair.

1281
01:48:10,383 --> 01:48:14,945
Yesterday it was fine.
- The engine has caught fire.

1282
01:48:15,722 --> 01:48:18,384
We'll walk. Come.

1283
01:48:18,625 --> 01:48:21,219
l went to Guruvayoor even
before the car came.

1284
01:48:22,729 --> 01:48:24,219
l can't lift the hand.

1285
01:48:24,431 --> 01:48:28,492
After coming back
l will massage it.

1286
01:48:28,702 --> 01:48:30,897
Then the pain will reduce.

1287
01:48:32,339 --> 01:48:34,136
There is no doubt.

1288
01:48:34,341 --> 01:48:38,038
This is his son only.
Look how Ajayan's walking.

1289
01:48:38,245 --> 01:48:41,646
That boy also walks identically.
- Correct.

1290
01:48:41,848 --> 01:48:43,315
l noticed itjust now.

1291
01:48:53,260 --> 01:48:55,160
lsn't it correct?
- Yes.

1292
01:48:55,362 --> 01:48:58,354
Wear that also.
- Take this 'Pappad' also.

1293
01:48:58,565 --> 01:49:01,591
Let me see. lt is very nice.

1294
01:49:01,801 --> 01:49:03,792
You have been going to
Guruvayoor for so long.

1295
01:49:04,004 --> 01:49:06,336
Have you ever felt like
buying anything?

1296
01:49:06,973 --> 01:49:08,565
l didn't think so.

1297
01:49:08,775 --> 01:49:11,107
Keep this 'Bindi' also.
There are many sizes.

1298
01:49:11,311 --> 01:49:13,370
A small size Guruvayoor Appan statue.

1299
01:49:15,382 --> 01:49:18,874
l feel bad.
- Me too.

1300
01:49:20,020 --> 01:49:23,114
Why are you feeling bad?
- That is..

1301
01:49:23,323 --> 01:49:25,951
My mother had lot of glass bangles.

1302
01:49:26,159 --> 01:49:29,356
Many times she used
to keep a big 'Bindi'.

1303
01:49:35,735 --> 01:49:38,727
Shall l wear all these bangles and
a big 'Bindi' tomorrow?

1304
01:49:38,939 --> 01:49:41,703
Then l'll come and stand in front of you.
- No need.

1305
01:49:43,043 --> 01:49:43,907
lt is Ajayan.

1306
01:49:44,110 --> 01:49:45,702
lt is late. l'll go.

1307
01:49:51,785 --> 01:49:53,218
Wait. l'll drop you.

1308
01:49:53,420 --> 01:49:56,685
No need. Karthik is there. Come.

1309
01:50:02,028 --> 01:50:03,620
lt is the luck of Rose.

1310
01:50:03,830 --> 01:50:06,924
lf you've someone like this in the neighboring
house, you won't know how time passes.

1311
01:50:07,601 --> 01:50:11,435
Look at his style.
- lt is good.

1312
01:50:12,172 --> 01:50:13,298
He is not minding us.

1313
01:50:13,473 --> 01:50:15,338
He is so smart.

1314
01:50:16,676 --> 01:50:19,873
Laugh silently.
- His father is noticing us.

1315
01:50:20,080 --> 01:50:21,945
He is watching.

1316
01:50:24,317 --> 01:50:27,684
He is like a film star.
- Correct. Come.

1317
01:50:27,887 --> 01:50:29,047
Why were you so late?

1318
01:50:29,255 --> 01:50:32,418
No wonder you come late to school.

1319
01:50:37,263 --> 01:50:39,197
Put one cup full in each of them.

1320
01:50:43,970 --> 01:50:44,937
One minute.

1321
01:50:45,905 --> 01:50:48,669
Get ready soon. Lilly, you also come.

1322
01:50:48,875 --> 01:50:51,503
We have to go to hospital.
- What is the matter?

1323
01:50:51,711 --> 01:50:55,909
Nothing to worry.
The school bus overturned at a corner.

1324
01:50:56,116 --> 01:50:58,107
The kids of this house were also in that.

1325
01:51:01,187 --> 01:51:02,586
My kids.

1326
01:51:02,789 --> 01:51:05,485
There is nothing to worry.
All of them have been admitted in the hospital.

1327
01:51:06,326 --> 01:51:08,794
Dear.
- Anappa.

1328
01:51:10,030 --> 01:51:11,019
Start the vehicle.
- To where?

1329
01:51:11,231 --> 01:51:12,323
Start the vehicle.

1330
01:51:14,501 --> 01:51:16,662
Where should l go?
- City hospital.

1331
01:51:17,103 --> 01:51:19,003
All the injured have been
admitted in the City hospital.

1332
01:51:19,172 --> 01:51:21,800
Of them five are in serious conditions.

1333
01:51:46,933 --> 01:51:56,899
Central-TmG

1334
01:52:19,199 --> 01:52:23,863
Mathai. God saved them.
Both are quite alright.

1335
01:53:04,144 --> 01:53:06,203
Give it to me.
- Give it to me.

1336
01:53:06,412 --> 01:53:10,246
Give it to me.
- Give it to me.

1337
01:53:18,958 --> 01:53:19,947
Have it.

1338
01:53:27,467 --> 01:53:28,832
l'll take it.
- l'll take it.

1339
01:53:29,102 --> 01:53:30,194
Give it to me.

1340
01:53:31,037 --> 01:53:33,301
What are you staring at?

1341
01:53:33,506 --> 01:53:36,634
The collaboration of
father-in-law and son-in-law.

1342
01:53:36,843 --> 01:53:38,276
lt is making my body shiver.

1343
01:53:38,478 --> 01:53:40,742
What love? What togetherness?

1344
01:53:40,947 --> 01:53:43,916
Will anyone say that they were like
enemies for eight years?

1345
01:53:44,117 --> 01:53:49,214
There is a time for everything.
- Yes, yes.

1346
01:53:50,423 --> 01:53:52,118
What is this?
- Beef.

1347
01:53:52,559 --> 01:53:53,753
Balettan. You don't eat much.

1348
01:53:53,960 --> 01:53:56,224
Now too your cholesterol is high.
- Okay.

1349
01:53:56,629 --> 01:54:00,360
lf we die of cholesterol,
there is no problem.

1350
01:54:00,567 --> 01:54:04,731
Your wife is the ideal wife.
lsn't there anything else?

1351
01:54:04,938 --> 01:54:07,270
lf it is time for dinner, tell me.
Everything is ready.

1352
01:54:07,473 --> 01:54:08,599
Today Ajayan can eat here.

1353
01:54:08,808 --> 01:54:11,299
My mother has cooked for me.

1354
01:54:12,245 --> 01:54:15,271
No need for too much celebration.
Have less liquor.

1355
01:54:15,481 --> 01:54:16,379
Today you have had too much.

1356
01:54:16,583 --> 01:54:18,710
Today l can have a bit more.
- l'm leaving.

1357
01:54:18,918 --> 01:54:21,318
l have to slash two more coconut trees.
- Manietta.

1358
01:54:21,521 --> 01:54:23,079
Give it to me.
- No need.

1359
01:54:23,289 --> 01:54:26,349
l don't want the money for today's toddy.
But you must give us a party.

1360
01:54:26,559 --> 01:54:28,151
lsn't it, Ajaya?
- Of course.

1361
01:54:30,563 --> 01:54:32,531
Take two pieces and eat.

1362
01:54:34,534 --> 01:54:37,264
Wasn't the problem between
you only this much?

1363
01:54:37,604 --> 01:54:39,765
You won't understand, if l tell you.

1364
01:54:39,973 --> 01:54:42,567
For that you must have your own family.

1365
01:54:42,775 --> 01:54:45,300
You must have children.
He should come as Mr. Variyar's son.

1366
01:54:45,511 --> 01:54:48,139
But it was my daughter
who gave birth to his children.

1367
01:54:48,348 --> 01:54:51,545
lf they get hurt,
blood comes from my heart.

1368
01:54:51,751 --> 01:54:54,720
That is blood relation.
- He knows about that very well now.

1369
01:54:55,154 --> 01:54:57,918
The ghost which was in bottle for
16 years came out now.

1370
01:54:58,157 --> 01:54:59,749
What has to come together,
will surely come together.

1371
01:54:59,959 --> 01:55:01,290
Bala. We need not
talk about that topic.

1372
01:55:01,494 --> 01:55:03,018
You don't have the answer,
that is the truth.

1373
01:55:03,229 --> 01:55:05,720
Truth will surely come out.
lf not today then tomorrow.

1374
01:55:06,232 --> 01:55:07,130
Wait and see.

1375
01:55:07,333 --> 01:55:10,996
lf you are so sure he is cheating you,
isn't there a law here.

1376
01:55:11,204 --> 01:55:12,967
lsn't there science?
- What science?

1377
01:55:13,172 --> 01:55:14,696
Do a DNA test.

1378
01:55:16,075 --> 01:55:17,906
A DNA test. Haven't you heard?

1379
01:55:18,111 --> 01:55:20,477
That is the best method to
find out blood relation.

1380
01:55:21,347 --> 01:55:22,780
l was going to tell you that, that day itself.

1381
01:55:22,982 --> 01:55:27,043
Then seeing you hesitate l thought may be
what that boy is saying is true.

1382
01:55:27,253 --> 01:55:28,720
Now also l'm serious.

1383
01:55:28,922 --> 01:55:30,890
lf you are sure, he is not your
son then you do the test.

1384
01:55:31,090 --> 01:55:34,116
You are not a good friend.
Or else you won't doubt me.

1385
01:55:34,327 --> 01:55:36,761
l'll not doubt you. Come, let's walk.

1386
01:55:38,531 --> 01:55:40,328
l want his identity card.

1387
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,594
Then a letter stating that
he is ready for a DNA test.

1388
01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:47,369
An advocate will prepare that.
You just make him sign it.

1389
01:55:47,573 --> 01:55:51,270
This is our police method.
To block all the loop holes in the law.

1390
01:55:51,477 --> 01:55:54,002
That is required.
We must close all holes.

1391
01:55:54,213 --> 01:55:56,147
l want to prove it in front of everyone.

1392
01:55:56,349 --> 01:55:58,408
That l have not made such a mistake.

1393
01:56:09,329 --> 01:56:10,523
Advocate. You get down.

1394
01:56:10,797 --> 01:56:12,094
Karthik.

1395
01:56:19,439 --> 01:56:20,531
Karthik.

1396
01:56:24,344 --> 01:56:25,436
Slowly. Slowly.

1397
01:56:32,151 --> 01:56:33,778
Do you have an identity card?

1398
01:56:34,654 --> 01:56:37,214
Do you have an identity card?
- l have the School identity card.

1399
01:56:37,423 --> 01:56:38,754
That is enough. Come, come.
- Where to?

1400
01:56:38,958 --> 01:56:40,118
l have some work.

1401
01:56:50,837 --> 01:56:52,964
There is no need for a test.
l'll go today itself.

1402
01:56:53,172 --> 01:56:55,231
That is not required.
You must not go.

1403
01:56:55,441 --> 01:56:56,635
You are my son.

1404
01:56:56,843 --> 01:57:00,301
lf you prove that then only you
l'll get my property.

1405
01:57:00,513 --> 01:57:03,209
l don't want property.
- lt could be for anything.

1406
01:57:03,416 --> 01:57:05,509
We must come to an agreement on this.

1407
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:10,411
Ajaya! Why have you brought the lawyer?

1408
01:57:10,623 --> 01:57:13,091
Nothing. Just to check his blood.

1409
01:57:14,193 --> 01:57:14,659
For what?

1410
01:57:14,861 --> 01:57:18,024
Bala! Everything is ready.
We'll come to the hospital just now.

1411
01:57:18,231 --> 01:57:20,631
Advocate is with me. You also come.

1412
01:57:20,833 --> 01:57:25,167
Why to test blood?
- l'll come back and then tell you.

1413
01:57:26,806 --> 01:57:29,536
Get in. lf you jump from the vehicle,
l'll kill you.

1414
01:57:29,742 --> 01:57:30,766
Advocate! You also get in.

1415
01:57:37,283 --> 01:57:47,249
Central-TmG

1416
01:57:52,432 --> 01:57:54,866
Do you know what for this test is?

1417
01:57:55,068 --> 01:57:55,796
l know.

1418
01:57:56,002 --> 01:57:57,902
lf it comes negative, there will be case.

1419
01:57:58,104 --> 01:57:59,002
You'll have to go to jail.

1420
01:57:59,205 --> 01:58:00,672
Doctor! Don't scare him.

1421
01:58:00,873 --> 01:58:02,704
All that is only after the test.

1422
01:58:02,909 --> 01:58:05,343
ls rest of the formalities over?
- Yes.

1423
01:58:05,545 --> 01:58:07,103
Then we'll go to lab.

1424
01:58:08,581 --> 01:58:10,310
Balan! You wait here.

1425
01:58:10,917 --> 01:58:12,316
You stay here.
Come.

1426
01:58:19,025 --> 01:58:21,255
Ajaya! What is this?
- Nothing.

1427
01:58:21,461 --> 01:58:24,453
What is it that you can't tell me.
- You be with Balan.

1428
01:58:24,730 --> 01:58:27,665
l'll come & tell you everything.
- No. l want to know just now.

1429
01:58:27,867 --> 01:58:29,266
Mom!- Ammukutty Amma!
Don't create a commotion.

1430
01:58:29,469 --> 01:58:31,596
This is a medical test to know
whether he is Ajayan's son.

1431
01:58:31,804 --> 01:58:33,328
On getting result we'll know the truth.

1432
01:58:34,307 --> 01:58:38,209
So this drama was for that?

1433
01:58:38,411 --> 01:58:41,642
lf you have money & power,
you can do any test.

1434
01:58:41,848 --> 01:58:44,316
The doctors will write as per your wish.

1435
01:58:44,517 --> 01:58:48,647
With that you can win in court.
But you can't win before your conscience.

1436
01:58:48,855 --> 01:58:51,346
This is an opportunity l'm getting to
prove that l'm innocent.

1437
01:58:51,557 --> 01:58:52,888
You don't spoil that by being adamant.

1438
01:58:53,092 --> 01:58:55,151
He is not my son. Shouldn't l prove that?

1439
01:58:55,361 --> 01:58:58,797
By which test it was proved that
you are your father's son?

1440
01:59:00,066 --> 01:59:04,935
Children are God's given.
lt was that God who gave me you & him.

1441
01:59:05,138 --> 01:59:08,437
Opposing that no one
needs to do any test here.

1442
01:59:08,641 --> 01:59:10,165
You come, dear!
- Mother!

1443
01:59:41,574 --> 01:59:43,166
l have kept the food on table.

1444
01:59:43,809 --> 01:59:45,003
lf you want, you come & eat.

1445
01:59:53,219 --> 01:59:54,652
What is this Aunty?

1446
01:59:54,854 --> 01:59:57,345
All three of you are sitting on
each side without talking.

1447
01:59:57,557 --> 01:59:58,854
lf you continue like this,
will the problem end?

1448
02:00:11,971 --> 02:00:16,169
lt is not my duty to stand for
your convenience. l'm going.

1449
02:00:16,542 --> 02:00:19,841
Close the door.
- Wait. l'll also come.

1450
02:00:23,849 --> 02:00:26,249
l'm not advising you.

1451
02:00:26,452 --> 02:00:30,616
You and mother don't fight unnecessarily.

1452
02:00:32,191 --> 02:00:36,184
None of you will understand my problems.
- l understand.

1453
02:00:36,729 --> 02:00:40,096
Till this date l thought you made a mistake.

1454
02:00:40,766 --> 02:00:44,793
But now l feel there is something
behind this that we don't know.

1455
02:00:46,505 --> 02:00:49,997
l have decided something.
l'm not telling that now to mother.

1456
02:00:50,209 --> 02:00:52,803
You also keep it in heart.
- What is that?

1457
02:00:53,846 --> 02:00:55,905
l enquired about him in Salem.

1458
02:00:56,115 --> 02:00:58,481
Even the school people don't know much.

1459
02:00:59,051 --> 02:01:02,248
With what ever proof l have tomorrow
l'm going to Chennai.

1460
02:01:03,155 --> 02:01:05,817
Some old acquaint of mine should be there.

1461
02:01:22,508 --> 02:01:32,474
Central-TmG

1462
02:02:06,385 --> 02:02:09,411
Some years back here there used
to be houses. Line rooms.

1463
02:02:09,622 --> 02:02:11,988
Do you have any idea
where those tenants are?

1464
02:02:12,191 --> 02:02:16,184
Nair! He is asking something in Malayalam.
You clear his doubts.

1465
02:02:19,932 --> 02:02:22,492
What do you want?
l'm coming from Palakkadu.

1466
02:02:22,702 --> 02:02:24,966
Some years back here
there used to be houses.

1467
02:02:25,171 --> 02:02:27,833
One of my acquaint lived in that.
l came to see him.

1468
02:02:28,040 --> 02:02:29,530
l don't know where he shifted from here.

1469
02:02:29,742 --> 02:02:32,006
Some years back means...
- Some 18 years back.

1470
02:02:32,211 --> 02:02:35,703
What is the use of enquiring about that now?

1471
02:02:35,915 --> 02:02:39,646
City is totally changing.
lt is 6 years since we started this hotel.

1472
02:02:39,852 --> 02:02:42,548
Matters before that. Do one thing.

1473
02:02:42,755 --> 02:02:45,952
There is a lady at the end of
this road who sells flowers.

1474
02:02:46,158 --> 02:02:47,489
She has been staying here
from a long time

1475
02:02:47,693 --> 02:02:49,991
She must know.
- Thanks!

1476
02:02:51,030 --> 02:02:52,088
Hello!

1477
02:02:52,264 --> 02:02:55,859
ls it Sunderasen?
lt is flower woman talking.

1478
02:02:56,068 --> 02:03:03,065
Now there is AR Bakery.
Before there used to be huts there.

1479
02:03:03,843 --> 02:03:07,677
ln one of those huts

She was in the dancing troop.

1535
02:06:47,066 --> 02:06:51,093
When the hero & heroin dance some
people dance in the back ground.

1536
02:06:51,303 --> 02:06:52,565
She is one in that.

1537
02:07:11,290 --> 02:07:12,484
One.. Two..

1538
02:07:18,631 --> 02:07:25,264
''You have the light of moon
and the beauty of garden''

1539
02:07:28,641 --> 02:07:34,978
''ln the intimate times
you give the ultimate happiness.''

1540
02:07:35,180 --> 02:07:41,551
''The dawn light rays are like
sprinkling of pure sweet water''

1541
02:07:41,754 --> 02:07:47,021
''From the feelings my heart will blossom.''

1542
02:07:47,226 --> 02:07:50,218
Cut it.
- ''The moon light''

1543
02:07:52,865 --> 02:07:54,127
Shanti! What did you do?

1544
02:07:54,333 --> 02:07:56,563
Where are you seeing and dancing?
- Sorry, master.

1545
02:07:56,769 --> 02:08:01,069
Sorry! You have learnt that well.
Now dance. Music.

1546
02:08:02,341 --> 02:08:05,902
One.. Two..
- ''From the feelings my heart will blossom.''

1547
02:08:06,111 --> 02:08:07,078
Cut it.

1548
02:08:07,546 --> 02:08:09,241
What are you doing? Go away.

1549
02:08:10,049 --> 02:08:11,073
Get out.

1550
02:08:13,819 --> 02:08:15,684
Ready girls.
Start music.

1551
02:08:15,888 --> 02:08:22,191
''From the feelings my heart will blossom.''

1552
02:08:22,394 --> 02:08:23,122
''You have the light of moon and
the beauty of garden''

1553
02:08:23,328 --> 02:08:24,522
What happened?

1554
02:08:25,431 --> 02:08:28,093
Dasa! Get the car.

1555
02:08:28,734 --> 02:08:30,361
John! Get the car.

1556
02:08:33,706 --> 02:08:35,697
She was pregnant.

1557
02:08:35,908 --> 02:08:39,344
After asking many times also she didn't tell
the man who was responsible for this.

1558
02:08:39,778 --> 02:08:42,144
From that day her father
became a drunkard.

1559
02:08:42,347 --> 02:08:44,281
Daily he used to scold and beat her.

1560
02:08:44,750 --> 02:08:49,619
On the day she delivered
he died in front of a lorry.

1561
02:08:49,822 --> 02:08:52,290
Some said it was accident
others said it was suicide.

1562
02:08:52,491 --> 02:08:55,255
From that day her mother
also became her enemy.

1563
02:08:55,461 --> 02:08:59,898
Little by little she became mad.
ln the end mother also died.

1564
02:09:00,899 --> 02:09:05,859
Even though she became alone
she never went for help to anyone.

1565
02:09:06,038 --> 02:09:07,903
She used to go to work with the child.

1566
02:09:26,125 --> 02:09:28,320
Come, come.

1567
02:09:38,003 --> 02:09:47,969
Central-TmG

1568
02:10:04,163 --> 02:10:07,530
As the son is with me no one is calling me
for out door shooting, Syed Ali Khan

1569
02:10:07,833 --> 02:10:12,896
Work is very less. l'm thinking a matter.
- What matter?

1570
02:10:13,105 --> 02:10:16,597
ln Salem l know someone.
They are nice people.

1571
02:10:16,809 --> 02:10:19,039
They have agreed to look after the child.

1572
02:10:19,244 --> 02:10:22,941
lt is enough if l give money.
- lt is better that you think of a family.

1573
02:10:23,148 --> 02:10:26,083
Don't you want a company?
- Now?

1574
02:10:26,285 --> 02:10:30,119
l don't want any company.
My son is enough.

1575
02:10:30,322 --> 02:10:36,318
l'll educate him. Without any short coming
l'll bring him up.

1576
02:10:51,343 --> 02:10:53,243
Okay?
- Fine.

1577
02:10:53,612 --> 02:10:54,840
Ok, girls.

1578
02:11:00,786 --> 02:11:02,583
lt is pack up. You get the vehicle.

1579
02:11:04,089 --> 02:11:05,181
Syed Ali Khan!

1580
02:11:06,058 --> 02:11:07,753
See my son's photo.

1581
02:11:07,960 --> 02:11:09,427
They sent from Salem.

1582
02:11:23,041 --> 02:11:24,599
Allaho Akbar!

1583
02:11:29,448 --> 02:11:31,245
Syed Ali Khan! l'm going to Kodaikanal.

1584
02:11:31,450 --> 02:11:33,418
lt is a Telugu movie. There are 2-3 songs.

1585
02:11:33,619 --> 02:11:37,555
l'll come after 10-12 days only.
By then will you find a rent house for me?

1586
02:11:37,990 --> 02:11:40,083
A small flat is also enough.

1587
02:11:40,292 --> 02:11:42,556
Have they thrown you out of hostel?

1588
02:11:42,761 --> 02:11:45,594
Not that.
l'm going to bring my son here.

1589
02:11:45,797 --> 02:11:48,664
This week his exam will start.
Now he is in 10th.

1590
02:11:48,867 --> 02:11:50,164
l'm going to admit him for +2 here.

1591
02:11:50,369 --> 02:11:53,429
l have told for his admission.
- Good thing.

1592
02:11:53,639 --> 02:11:55,402
lf the rent is also more, it's okay.

1593
02:11:55,607 --> 02:11:58,269
The house should be clean.
- We will get it done.

1594
02:11:58,477 --> 02:12:01,310
You go and come.
- When l come, l won't find time.

1595
02:12:01,513 --> 02:12:04,744
l told Kartik that it'll reach
by the time the exam gets over.

1596
02:12:04,950 --> 02:12:07,578
The house will be ready when you come
after completing the shooting.

1597
02:12:07,786 --> 02:12:09,310
Ok?
- Fine.

1598
02:12:14,126 --> 02:12:17,562
Pray that my son must score good marks.
- l'll.

1599
02:12:25,070 --> 02:12:29,769
She came back as she said.
She returned by ambulance.

1600
02:12:29,975 --> 02:12:33,342
While shooting,
she slipped and fell into the slope.

1601
02:12:33,545 --> 02:12:35,570
She was admitted in lCU for three days.

1602
02:12:35,781 --> 02:12:37,578
When she became sure that
she's going to die...

1603
02:12:37,783 --> 02:12:40,479
she told me not to inform her son
till his exams get over.

1604
02:12:41,520 --> 02:12:43,886
Then, l only brought him from Salem.

1605
02:12:44,089 --> 02:12:48,287
After hearing all this, he didn't cry.
He didn't fell down.

1606
02:12:48,493 --> 02:12:50,688
He became numbed.

1607
02:12:57,970 --> 02:12:59,801
That day, he didn't eat anything.

1608
02:13:00,005 --> 02:13:03,463
He was about to sleep in his room for some
time. So, l left him in his room and went out.

1609
02:13:03,675 --> 02:13:06,735
When l came back, he was found missing.
When l saw.

1610
02:13:18,056 --> 02:13:19,853
What are you doing here, my son?
Come here.

1611
02:13:22,894 --> 02:13:27,922
l told him a lie. His father is still alive.

1612
02:13:28,133 --> 02:13:30,829
l told him that his name is
Ajeyan staying in Palakkad.

1613
02:13:31,036 --> 02:13:34,665
Before you were born,
he left you and went.

1614
02:13:41,380 --> 02:13:45,976
To make him believe,
l gave a photo which l had with me.

1615
02:13:49,788 --> 02:13:51,312
What l did was wrong.

1616
02:13:51,523 --> 02:13:55,550
But in that condition,
l was forced to say like this.

1617
02:13:55,761 --> 02:14:01,324
Or else, he might suicide
without anyone in this world.

1618
02:14:01,533 --> 02:14:05,094
Will anyone do like this?
There are many people without anyone.

1619
02:14:05,303 --> 02:14:07,100
You don't understand that condition.

1620
02:14:07,305 --> 02:14:12,004
lf at all your father is dead,
you can remember him.

1621
02:14:13,979 --> 02:14:18,507
You know my father.
l was only 10 days old.

1622
02:14:18,717 --> 02:14:19,979
My father left my mother.
She only told me about him.

1623
02:14:20,185 --> 02:14:23,518
My father's name is Abdul Rehman
staying in Malapuram

1624
02:14:23,722 --> 02:14:25,519
Till this date, l haven't seen my father.

1625
02:14:25,657 --> 02:14:28,524
But l've a feeling in my mind
that l'm not alone.

1626
02:14:28,727 --> 02:14:33,721
That's a belief.
- But, why did you mention my name?

1627
02:14:34,900 --> 02:14:37,562
To comfort him, you spoilt my life.

1628
02:14:40,005 --> 02:14:44,442
My mother won't believe all this.
- l'll tell your mother.

1629
02:14:44,643 --> 02:14:46,611
When he see me, he will recognize.

1630
02:14:46,812 --> 02:14:50,714
When he knows the truth,
God will give him strength to bear.

1631
02:14:58,323 --> 02:15:08,289
Central-TmG

1632
02:15:21,379 --> 02:15:24,507
He is Syed Ali Khan from Chennai.

1633
02:15:25,117 --> 02:15:28,177
Where is Karthik?
- He left this place.

1634
02:15:29,921 --> 02:15:31,946
Where?
- l don't know.

1635
02:15:32,157 --> 02:15:34,250
Did you enquire?
- No.

1636
02:15:34,459 --> 02:15:37,428
He understood that you left this
place since he's here.

1637
02:15:37,629 --> 02:15:39,153
What he did was right.

1638
02:15:39,364 --> 02:15:43,095
You are my son.
l must Believe only what you say.

1639
02:15:46,204 --> 02:15:49,469
He asked me whether he can go.
l didn't deny.

1640
02:15:53,612 --> 02:15:56,638
At what time, he left?
- Sometime before.

1641
02:15:57,916 --> 02:15:59,713
You come.

1642

lt's a belief.

1648
02:17:33,678 --> 02:17:35,202

1650
02:17:55,467 --> 02:17:56,991

1651
02:17:58,236 --> 02:18:01,899
He is my son only. Your grandson.

1652
02:18:34,606 --> 02:18:43,071
''Like a sweet, savior mother
aren't you there forever?''

1653
02:18:43,281 --> 02:18:51,313
''ln my happiness and sadness like
shadow are you not with me?''

1654
02:18:51,523 --> 02:19:06,598
''ln my tears.. ln my tears,
also clearly in my dreams.''

1655
02:19:06,805 --> 02:19:15,440
''ln the new land like a
language you are there.''

1656
02:19:15,647 --> 02:19:22,553
''Like a never ending
thought you are in my heart.''

1657
02:19:22,754 --> 02:19:31,321
''Like a sweet, savior mother
aren't you there forever?''

1658
02:20:02,494 --> 02:20:11,027
''To the lips which are yearning to speak
and love, you became a sweet.''

1659
02:20:11,236 --> 02:20:17,971
''To the lips which are yearning to speak
and love, you became a sweet.''
