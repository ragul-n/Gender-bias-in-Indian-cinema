1
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,200
Good morning, sir

2
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,720
Air of festivity, wherever
the movie was screened

3
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,120
True, add this line next

4
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,160
Creating a sensation
in every single region

5
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,000
So what if it's only the 2nd day

6
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,800
Only we should boost our film

7
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,400
Start a controversy
in Facebook and Twitter

8
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,320
Pack up the old bandicoots

9
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,080
Are we running
a home for the aged?

10
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,560
Have you come to narrate a story?

11
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,520
In those days directors
Bharathiraja and Bhagyaraj...

12
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,720
...will narrate their stories to me

13
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,120
You go inside, sir

14
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,000
He's a pest of the first order!

15
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,360
You asked me to come
and narrate my story

16
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,480
Did I tell you to come today?

17
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,560
Please sit

18
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,360
If the movie isn't doing well...

19
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,760
...random strangers tear us apart

20
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,880
Is this your story?

21
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,720
Of course, sir

22
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,560
Because tomorrow some chap
shouldn't sue me...

23
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,320
...claiming it's his story
just before release

24
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,680
I won't have money then to defend

25
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,120
Okay, what's the title?

26
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,200
'De Monte Colony'

27
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,200
'In 19th century
in Alwarpet, Chennai...'

28
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,200
'...lived John De Monte
a wealthy business tycoon'

29
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,200
He suddenly shoots with a gun

30
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,400
Building blasts, sir
Suddenl-

31
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,440
That's enough, stop

32
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,120
You said it's a small budget film

33
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,120
But now you say
it's a period film

34
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,120
Building blast

35
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,400
All that can be done
with graphics, sir

36
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,720
Is graphics done in
MGR market free of cost?

37
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,800
Have you seen their charges?

38
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,920
A snake attacking its prey
costs 1.5 million

39
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,320
It all works out the same

40
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,640
Is this a true story?

41
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,640
No, sir

42
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,240
De Monte colony actually exists, sir

43
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,440
I made a script with
the stories I heard

44
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,560
Plus my own imagination

45
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,080
God knows what you did!

46
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,640
Do you have a comedy script?

47
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,880
What kind of story?

48
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,280
Absolutely no story!

49
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,240
Throughout the film, hero and
comedian should talk nonstop

50
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,880
Viewer shouldn't be able to guess...

51
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,800
...who is the hero and
who is the comedian

52
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,120
Audience should roll
on the floor with laughter

53
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,520
With pretty girls in
skimpy dresses dancing

54
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,320
I want 5 song situations

55
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:53,120
"If life becomes dummy, to no avail"

56
00:05:53,200 --> 00:06:00,200
"Even Jimmy will stop wagging his tail"

57
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:07,160
"If you're a burden
to your mummy and daddy"

58
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:13,400
"...you'll run out of luck
even in a game of rummy"

59
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,200
A girl screams out
'God will come to save me'

60
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,360
Suddenly someone jumps
through the thatched roof

61
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,160
A big blast

62
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,120
Slowly the camera pans-

63
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,840
Bro, tea and cigarette

64
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,840
Fix the shot

65
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,920
We pull back

66
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,480
We show the hero

67
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,480
How's the suspense?

68
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,160
Wowww!

69
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,760
Awesome, huh?

70
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,640
Thank you

71
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,000
Who do you have in mind
to play the hero's role?

72
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,280
I'm thinking of
doing it myself, boss

73
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,520
- What, boss?
- Nothing

74
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,120
'Lady Luck has lost it!'

75
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,920
Let me tell you the love scene

76
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,600
We show a cute and bubbly heroine

77
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,200
She whizzes in riding a yellow scooter,
without even removing its stand

78
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,200
Mom...?

79
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,360
What?

80
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,920
What is it?

81
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,440
Hey! Sajith

82
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,280
Which fan did I
ask you to fix here?

83
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,120
Brown fan, madam

84
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,400
Are you deaf or what?

85
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,920
Fix the white fan right away

86
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,480
Let me get hold
of the watchman

87
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,840
His reference sucks!

88
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,480
We've come to install your TV

89
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,280
Don't turn on the switch

90
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,760
I don't know if I can trust him

91
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,480
Why did you do that?

92
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,440
How sad, nothing happened

93
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,200
Can you come here?

94
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,720
Coming, sir

95
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,320
What, sir?

96
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,120
Drill 4 holes where I've marked

97
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,160
- Got it?
- Okay, sir

98
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,000
Come here

99
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:57,920
Go there

100
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,560
Who will fix that fan?

101
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,560
Do you know the job or not?

102
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,240
Don't step into this house

103
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,120
How can you be so useless?

104
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,640
I finished all the work, madam

105
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,560
What about the plug point?

106
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,400
I fixed it

107
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,800
How much should I pay you?

108
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,320
Rs 700 for the materials

109
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,920
Rs 700 for labor, madam

110
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,160
For the kind of job you did
1400 is way too much!

111
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,120
Round it up to Rs 1000

112
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,520
Madam, I've also fixed
the wiring for the air conditioner

113
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,040
- Madam?
- Yes

114
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,920
Installation charges Rs 1500

115
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,920
'He charges 1500 for just
lifting a TV set and fixing it?'

116
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,600
"This dumbass donkey
dilly dallying with Inky or Pinky"

117
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,000
"He's worthless and wimpy"

118
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,720
"Self respect and dignity
are off on a vacation happily"

119
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,600
"Waste product in totality"

120
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:47,560
"Even the mosquito, dude
will think twice to bite you"

121
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,000
"Gone for a toss"

122
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,320
Tell me, Sappai

123
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,640
Vimal, a little while ago
Raghavan called me

124
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,200
But his phone is switched off now

125
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,000
He called me too

126
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,200
I spoke with him

127
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,000
I believe he's going
directly to the room

128
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,440
- You join him
- Okay, Vimal

129
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,120
More than enough
for this nitwit

130
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,280
Bend lower

131
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,840
Let me kiss you now

132
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,520
I gave you, right?

133
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,880
It's your turn now

134
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,440
I was so sweaty
I removed my vest

135
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,560
Aren't you sweating?

136
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,680
Hey!

137
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,840
Gawd! He's looking at her

138
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,280
He's looking at me too

139
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,640
What are you up to?

140
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,640
Drying my clothes!

141
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,880
Go away, boss

142
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,720
How indecent can you be!

143
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,920
Be fair, boss

144
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,160
Did I peek into your cabin?

145
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,400
You're the peeping Tom!

146
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,240
You came, you saw

147
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,160
Now please go, boss

148
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,680
Dai! Get lost

149
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,400
You and your scarecrow body

150
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,360
Clear out!

151
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,360
Baby, too many cockroaches

152
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,600
My privacy!

153
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,000
Wolf in a sheep's clothing
drooling over my girl!

154
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,920
Get lost

155
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:56,880
Tell me, Vimal

156
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,280
Hey! Sappai
Where are you?

157
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,840
Didn't you hear your phone ring?

158
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,800
I'm in the room

159
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,920
I fell asleep
Tell me

160
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,840
You'll give a complex
to RipVan Winkle

161
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,280
Is Raghavan there?

162
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,680
He said he was bugged

163
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,920
And he went upstairs

164
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,880
I'm feeling the same way too

165
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,080
Both of you come to the wine shop

166
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,160
I'll meet you there

167
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,000
Okay, Vimal

168
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,200
Hey, I've bought petrol

169
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,720
It's near the fridge

170
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,000
Bring it with you

171
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,920
Raghava, Vimal called just now

172
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,040
He asked us to
meet him at the wine shop

173
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,920
Shall we go?

174
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,640
I'm going out tonight
regarding some work

175
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,800
You carry on

176
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,000
What's so important?

177
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,080
You can run your errand later

178
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,360
Don't act pricey

179
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,400
Why are you pushing your bike?

180
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,160
No petrol, dude

181
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,840
Sappai, hand me the petrol can

182
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,800
Ooops! I forgot, Vimal

183
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,760
Don't know what you'll do

184
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,080
Push the bike till our room

185
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,080
Keep this inside

186
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,200
Sappai, give me money

187
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,000
I don't have any money on me

188
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,920
Neither do I

189
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,800
Why did you guys come
to drink without money?

190
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,920
Go to the curb and talk

191
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,400
Even toddlers are making
a beeline to wine shops

192
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,560
I wonder who will save our country

193
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,440
"Rakamma, clap your hand"

194
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,440
"Tune a song by waving your wand"

195
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,840
"Night bird, beat the drum, start"

196
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,720
"Touch a chord in this king's heart"

197
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,160
Yes, Vimal

198
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,520
Srini, where are you?

199
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,560
I'm here

200
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,440
You mean in Jillu's house?

201
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,880
Come to the point

202
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,680
Can you come here now?

203
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,520
Why...?

204
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,760
We were at a loose end
and decided to drink

205
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,400
But none of us have
a single pie on us

206
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,160
- Can you come now?
- Tough

207
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,840
Wait, I'll check and get back

208
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,440
What did he say?

209
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,320
Jillu...?

210
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,400
What?

211
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,480
The boys want to meet me
It's kind of urgent

212
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,720
Shall I go?
I'll be right back

213
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,840
What the hell do they want?

214
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,920
Didn't you tell them you won't
come for the next 2 days?

215
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:29,920
I told them

216
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,480
Then why are they bugging you?

217
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,800
If they call you once again...

218
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,560
...tell them I'll send them to jail

219
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,520
Driver, bring my suitcase in

220
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,840
Let me somehow cover up

221
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,200
Jillu...?

222
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,920
My husband is back

223
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:50,920
Leave immediately

224
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,080
What the heck?!

225
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,800
You said he'll come
only after 2 days

226
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,920
God knows why

227
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,120
Maybe he wanted
to surprise me

228
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,360
- Just go
- Get lost!

229
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,920
- Hey, come here
- What now?

230
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,200
Will you bang into
my husband like this?

231
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,360
He'll be suspicious

232
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,520
How else-

233
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,240
How else will I go out?

234
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,000
Shin down the pipe?

235
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,320
Why should I?

236
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,480
I'll walk out of the front door

237
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,760
As it is people are saying
we are having a steamy affair!

238
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,760
What is it I do here?

239
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,920
I peel garlic, sweep and mop
the floors, polish your shoes

240
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,560
I'm pretty much your slave

241
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,720
Baby...?

242
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,880
How could you
say that to me, Srini?

243
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,760
Do I treat you like a slave?

244
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,000
Won't you understand me?

245
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,160
Your husband is ringing
the bell like a siren

246
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,000
You are giving me
an Oscar award performance

247
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,000
Don't talk too much

248
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,400
Climb down the pipe

249
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,520
Hey! Wait

250
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,800
Here's 2000 bucks

251
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,160
If you want more money...

252
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,160
...call me only after 5:00 p.m, okay?

253
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:46,720
Leave now

254
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,040
"A stale bun too
stands before you"

255
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,560
"To spit on your face
with scorn in place"

256
00:14:53,640 --> 00:15:00,040
"Even if you apply oil, roll on the street
you need luck for mud to stick, isn't it?"

257
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:05,040
"Don't roam around the city
as a jobless nonentity"

258
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,360
"Escape, boss"

259
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:13,920
"If life becomes dummy, to no avail"

260
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:21,320
"Even your pet dog
won't wag his tail"

261
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,920
Tell me, dude

262
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,360
Vimal, have you guys left?

263
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,360
We are still at the bar

264
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,320
We'll be leaving now

265
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,640
You guys wait there
I'm on my way

266
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,800
Soooper, dude

267
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,000
Can you also get me
1 liter petrol on the way?

268
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,400
Okay, fine
Hang up now

269
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,120
Hey! He's here

270
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,880
'We know to put our arms
around our friend's shoulder'

271
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,760
'We also know to
skin our enemy alive'

272
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,440
'We prefer a face to face duel'

273
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,400
'Not backstab like you do'

274
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,640
'Not just me'

275
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,200
I'm so fed up with life

276
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,840
Thought I'll do a photo shoot

277
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,880
But my clients want to look
like actors Ajith and Arya

278
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,640
How a chap looks
is what the camera clicks, no?

279
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,920
I'm thinking of selling my camera

280
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,320
I'll be better off cleaning
camel's dung in Dubai!

281
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,520
In the end we need to
look at only such options

282
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,600
Why do you keep whining like this?

283
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,040
Keep trying

284
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,920
You'll succeed

285
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,800
Easier said than done

286
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,280
You walk right into a posh bungalow

287
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,280
Nobody knows what you do inside

288
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,400
But you come out
with your wallet bulging!

289
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,640
How many are lucky enough
to get such a cushy life?

290
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,640
My actions disgust you, right?

291
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,200
If I were in your shoes...

292
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,680
...I'd think the same way too

293
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,640
But how I'm caught between
the devil and the deep sea inside...

294
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,040
...only I know

295
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,600
Only silver lining is...

296
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,280
...I'll get money whenever I ask

297
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,080
At least I'm able to
take care of your expenses

298
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,440
You guys settle down first

299
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,560
Then I'll never again
step into that house

300
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:05,200
But don't keep moaning
and groaning in front of me

301
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,880
Instead of having
a long face like a loser...

302
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,080
...thinking you'll win someday

303
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,000
...put your collars up and
walk with a cocky assurance

304
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,640
Advice is always free!

305
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,600
Look there

306
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,160
'Life is a circle, dude'

307
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,480
'Winners will lose'

308
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,920
'Losers will win'

309
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,360
'You still haven't understood that'

310
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,160
Ready?

311
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,160
"Our life is like a match stick"

312
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,000
"If damp, it won't flare when lit"

313
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,160
"If you walk with temerity
you belong to the winning party"

314
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,880
"With an abrasive string
other kites you'll easily win"

315
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,760
"Show off in style openly"

316
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,600
"Fling your feelings away furiously"

317
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:36,000
"Dude, life is like a cool beer"

318
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,160
"Be the fizz in it with cheer"

319
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,280
'Life is a circle, dude'

320
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,520
'Winners will lose'

321
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,720
'Losers will win'

322
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,440
'You still haven't understood that'

323
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:08,000
"Your heart will whisper a word"

324
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,880
"If you pay heed, you'll move forward"

325
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,080
"If you're caught in a quicksand"

326
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,920
"I'll be right behind you to lend a hand"

327
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,880
"Kith and kin like the hen in the slum"

328
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,160
"will share only good times wholesome"

329
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,120
"Only friends will give their lives
in selfless sacrifice"

330
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,160
"Clasp your hands tighter"

331
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,160
"Climb up the ladder"

332
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,720
"Show off in style openly"

333
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,640
"Fling your feelings away furiously"

334
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:48,120
"Dude, life is like a cool beer"

335
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,320

340
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,280
"That chap will win, so will he"

341
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,800
"But don't lose heart, buddy"

342
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,240
"If you win, with awe he'll look up"

343
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,280
"March ahead, with fire in your step"

344
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:00,080

"Be the fizz in it with cheer"

348
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,520
(humming)

349
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,640
Looks like it's going to rain

350
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,840
Shall we leave
a little while later?

351
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,440
If I look at the sky
just once, it's enough

352
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,360
Sun will shine even at midnight!

353
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,720
It won't rain

354
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,640
Hello...?

355
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,920
Tomorrow if you go to
Alka Jewellers at 5 p.m...

356
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,320
...they'll have the cash ready

357
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,000
Okay

358
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,560
Collect the cash and call me

359
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,480
Okay

360
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,440
You're alone, right?

361
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,640
Can you say it just once?

362
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,920
Tell me

363
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,600
Jillu

364
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,280
Shall I disconnect?

365
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,360
Okay

366
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,880
I always wanted to ask you

367
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,640
Why do you call that lady Jillu?

368
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,920
Have you seen the film
'Jillunu oru kadhal'?

369
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,920
Yes

370
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,800
The hero Suriya will call
the heroine Jyotika 'Jillu'

371
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,680
I've also been ordered
to do the same

372
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,000
In that movie the hero
will drink and call her 'Jillu'

373
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,000
The shoe is on the other foot here!

374
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,400
Hey!

375
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,000
Just once

376
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,840
From your lips

377
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,040
Can you call me 'Jillu'?

378
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,920
What is he up to?

379
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,800
Jillu

380
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,640
I asked you to laugh

381
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,800
Heartily

382
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,480
Laugh the way
I did now and then say

383
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,720
'Jillu'

384
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,280
Tell

385
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,920
Go on

386
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,520
Jillu

387
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,600
Don't stop

388
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,600
Repeat

389
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,520
Again?

390
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,680
Once more

391
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,040
'And you call this
a story worth telling'

392
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,040
Today's liquor was too good, right?

393
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,560
Different level

394
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,760
Shall we go for a drive?

395
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,120
Let's not go anywhere

396
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,600
As soon as the rain stops,
let's go home

397
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,040
- You go if you want
- What arrogance!

398
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,080
Raghava, let's go somewhere

399
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,840
Let's do something really interesting

400
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,920
I know a place

401
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:09,840
Shall we go there?

402
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,920
Where?

403
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,320
Do you know
De Monte Colony?

404
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,000
In Alwarpet?

405
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,640
Yeah, I wanted
to go there today

406
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,160
It's supposed to be
a haunted bungalow

407
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,560
That's what everyone says

408
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,560
Shall we go check it out?

409
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,000
I'm not coming

410
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:24,880
Why?

411
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,480
Why won't you come?

412
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,920
I have some work
to do in the morning

413
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,080
At 7:00 a.m I must meet
the family astrologer

414
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,280
In fact my mom has asked
all 4 of us to meet him

415
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,240
True, she has asked us
to go without fail

416
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,920
Will the astrologer
predict everything correctly?

417
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,520
He will be spot on!

418
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,280
One look at you...

419
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,240
...will he immediately
know you're gay?

420
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,000
Let go of me

421
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,080
Srini, I'm going to my room
as soon as the rain stops

422
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,840
He's behaving like a rowdy

423
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,800
Started their squabble!

424
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,000
Rowdy?!

425
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,160
I'll make mince meat out of him

426
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,520
You know he's scared of the dark

427
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,760
And you want to drag him
to a haunted bungalow

428
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,600
Poor fellow

429
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,800
Why do you feel sorry for him?

430
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,160
Raghava, all the more reason
we're going to De Monte colony

431
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,280
I'll take Sappai inside

432
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,120
Just watch the fun

433
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,280
You are taking this too far

434
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,560
Don't force me

435
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,480
Gawd! Specimen

436
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,040
I'm not coming anywhere with you

437
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,160
Leave me alone

438
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,640
Vimal, listen to me

439
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,760
Hurry up

440
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,440
Vimal, help me get down

441
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,400
Don't make a fuss

442
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,480
If you don't I will-

443
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,880
Hey! He's biting me

444
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,360
Where are you going?

445
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,200
Wherever you take me
I won't come inside

446
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,680
- Listen to me
- Let's see

447
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,320
Please let me get down here

448
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,080
Don't do this

449
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,360
Let's go home

450
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,640
Get down

451
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,240
Get down!

452
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,160
Lift him

453
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,160
Hey! Listen to me

454
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,840
Leave me alone, Raghava

455
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,800
We're already carrying him

456
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,520
Keep moving

457
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,080
Please let go of me, Vimal

458
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,720
Watch your step

459
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,880
(door creaks open)

460
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,080
Why is this place so spooky?

461
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,040
Vimal, let's go

462
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,560
In the heart of the city...

463
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,040
...how is such a large place
left untouched?

464
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,680
There are many stories
about this place

465
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,040
Each one spins a fresh one

466
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,440
Why should we poke
our nose into those stories?

467
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,840
Is it a snake?

468
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,280
'I should play
some prank on him'

469
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,760
Vimal, why did you push him there?

470
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,480
Keep quiet and follow me

471
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,160
Vimal...!

472
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,000
How dare he call me a goon!

473
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,440
I'll make him go on
his bended knees!

474
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,480
Vimal

475
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,080
Srini...?

476
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,640
Hey! What happened?

477
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,440
Nothing

478
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,160
Sajith would have pissed
in his pants hearing this sound

479
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,520
My heart is thudding in my ears!

480
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,920
And he's all by himself

481
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,800
Sajith...?

482
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,600
Vimal...Vimal...?

483
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,800
Where are you guys?

484
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,880
(thumping sound)

485
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,440
Vimal

486
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Don't overdo it, Vimal

487
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,320
You don't intend stopping?

488
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,040
Simply follow me

489
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,400
I should've pushed you
instead of him!

490
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,160
Guys, where are you?

491
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,320
Srini...?

492
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,000
Vimal...?

493
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,400
Too much, right?

494
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,440
What's your problem?

495
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,000
One last time

496
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,680
(clears throat)

497
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,000
(howling)

498
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,680
Srini...?

499
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,840
(howling continues)

500
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,080
Srini...don't do this

501
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,800
This is just too much

502
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,480
Raghava, come

503
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,360
Sajith...can you hear me?

504
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,600
Sajith...?

505
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,280
I can hear him
on that side

506
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,720
Raghava, he's here

507
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,120
Where are you guys?

508
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,120
Sajith...?

509
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,400
Why are you doing this to me?

510
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,920
It's just a prank

511
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,760
Why get so scared?

512
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,200
Guys, let's not stay here any longer

513
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,560
Hurry up

514
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,360
Ignore him and just come

515
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,120
What happened?

516
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,920
Nothing

517
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,800
Let's go

518
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,800
So early in the morning
astrology and all that crap!

519
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,240
Do we have to go?

520
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,120
Keep going

521
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,840
Such a fuss-pot!

522
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,920
'God, let the astrologer
predict good for me alone'

523
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,320
I'm sure
He will

524
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:18,120
(prayer)

525
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,720
What a divine ambience!

526
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,520
'Lord Vishnu, shower Your grace'

527
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,400
Good morning, boys

528
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,480
Who is first?

529
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,400
Not me

530
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,720
Not for me either

531
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,640
If none of you want...

532
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,440
...whose future will he predict?

533
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,160
Let me look at yours

534
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:36,640
On this paper I want
your right thumb impression

535
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,560
We'll check your over-all benefits

536
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,280
Go ahead

537
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,800
Be confident, constant and courageous

538
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,640
That's good

539
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,400
(humming under his breath)

540
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:56,640
(matching the right palmyra manuscript)

541
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:01,920
Does your name start with K?

542
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,720
No

543
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,560
Let me check again

544
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,880
Get the 3rd bundle from that shelf

545
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,480
Does it start with letter T?

546
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,520
Not at all

547
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,920
I thought as much

548
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,040
It must be in that bundle

549
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,120
Here, sir

550
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,840
Smooth operator, no?

551
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,160
How about the letter S?

552
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,080
Yes

553
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,800
Is your name Srinivasan?

554
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,480
Right

555
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:30,600
Your thumbprint belongs
to the whorl pattern

556
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,360
Your date of birth is
January 26, 1988

557
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,400
12th day of
Tamil month Thai

558
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,280
Your name is Srinivasan

559
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,400
Father's name
Krishnamurthi

560
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,520
Mother Thilakavathy

561
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,920
According to this manuscript
your parents are no more

562
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:42,920
How's he bang on?

563
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,080
At the time of your birth...

564
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,080
...'Rahu' was in Gemini
Mars and Saturn in Virgo

565
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,000
Jupiter in Libra

566
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,000
Sun, Venus, Mercury in Capricorn

567
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,560
This turns out to be...

568
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,800
...a worthless and wasted birth

569
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,840
Whatever work you do...

570
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,480
...will be a wasted effort

571
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,120
You'll lead a hand
to mouth existence

572
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,360
Be a burden to mother earth

573
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,720
And breathe your last one day

574
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,120
(cackles in glee)

575
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,280
Let's check your marital life now

576
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,400
Can't get worse!

577
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,360
When saint Agasthiya wrote it...

578
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,680
...even his hands were trembling!

579
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,480
You'll never get married
in this birth for sure

580
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,840
Despite all odds...

581
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,880
...like world's 8th wonder

582
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,360
...if a girl is hell bent
on marrying only you

583
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,480
...the very same night she will
fly away faster than the wind

584
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,920
Waste...waste...waste!

585
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,760
In 6th century BC sage Agasthiya has
written your birth will be a total waste

586
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,720
End of your story

587
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,280
Your thumb impression

588
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,800
Yours is right here

589
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,280
'Harakiri'

590
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,520
Lord Shiva!

591
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,400
Your thumbprint is called...

592
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,880
...the ulna loop

593
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,440
According to this manuscript...

594
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,640
...your name is Vimal

595
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,280
Right

596
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,600
Your mother's name is Geetha

597
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,920
And your father is Ilango

598
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,000
Am I right?

599
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,400
(pleased laughter)

600
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,040
How will my life be, sir?

601
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,440
Life...huh?

602
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,720
He'll at least get food
without working till he dies

603
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,760
But you were born as
a curse to this society

604
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,440
If you can, please die today

605
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,840
Let's hope in your next birth
you have a better life

606
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,080
In your horoscope
the squares are all wonky

607
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,920
Why are you sending me
to my grave sooner than expected?

608
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,840
What about my marital life?

609
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,920
Hey!

610
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,360
Sonny, shall we see yours?

611
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,640
I don't want mine read

612
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,000
Why not?

613
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,920
You dragged us simple souls...

614
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,600
...to some half baked block head

615
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,000
Humiliated us
from head to toe

616
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,160
And you'll get away, huh?

617
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,320
Give him your thumbprint

618
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,640
Come on, sonny

619
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,520
'If he predicts good stuff for Sappai...

620
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,200
...I'll die a 1000 deaths, dude'

621
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,160
Wait...let me go in and check

622
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,800
Help me, God

623
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,040
How will my life
after marriage be, sir?

624
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,040
That's the only thing missing!

625
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,000
Raghava, I'm extremely irritated

626
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:10,840
Don't add fuel to the fire

627
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,000
Just keep quiet

628
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,200
I can't find it

629
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,560
Lord Shiva!

630
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,600
His manuscript is not in our bundle

631
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,040
But on Friday we're expecting...

632
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,760
...a fresh bundle from
Vaitheeswara temple

633
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,480
If you come on Saturday...

634
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,760
...I'll predict his future
from A to Z

635
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,160
It seems he'll tell in
alphabetical order!

636
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,440
Get his also

637
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,040
Making fun of me?

638
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,320
Sir, what about money?

639
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,000
Anyhow we are here
on Saturday, right?

640
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,080
We'll pay you then

641
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,360
Come definitely on Saturday

642
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,040
Do you want to check
any other chapter in your life?

643
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,400
This itself is a closed chapter!

644
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,480
Dude, he's a fraudster!

645
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,400
Because he said bad stuff,
he's a trickster, huh?

646
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,600
He was bang on about
our parents' names

647
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,560
Hello, tell me

648
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,360
I'm the astrologer speaking

649
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,600
I must tell you something

650
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,440
Come immediately

651
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,440
I'm half way back home

652
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,360
I'll come another day

653
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,240
It's urgent

654
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,840
Come right now

655
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,720
Just for this, I can't
come to Mogappair

656
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,840
I'll come another day

657
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,800
Please listen to me

658
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,040
I must definitely talk to you

659
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,560
- Come immediately
- Hello...?

660
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:35,920
Listen to me

661
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,920
I can't hear a word

662
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,440
Hello?

663
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,520
Why did you stop?

664
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,520
You go home

665
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,640
I have an errand to run

666
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,840
Where are you going?

667
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,520
Just go, I'll join you

668
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,440
Come, Raghava

669
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:56,600
"Even when wolves howl long and deep"

670
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,880
"Yama, lord of death will be asleep"

671
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,440
"Like a deer you're caught"

672
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:07,040
"To be hunted, believe it or not"

673
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:10,640
"To die by your own deed"

674
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:14,280
"This is the right time indeed"

675
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:17,800
"If you try to escape, futile"

676
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:21,920
"Curse follows you for a lifetime"

677
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,360
Why are you being so sissy
and watching a TV serial?

678
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,160
Come here

679
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,280
Take a look at this

680
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,320
De Monte colony, huh?

681
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,480
What exactly happened there?

682
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,440
Do you have any idea
how many have died there?

683
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,080
No one knows why or how

684
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,600
Each person tells a different story

685
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:13,640
But some of it is common
in all the versions

686
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,560
I assimilated everything

687
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,320
This is what I think happened

688
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,800
'In 19th century during
the British rule in India...'

689
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:23,840
'...John De Monte was
a business tycoon from Portugal'

690
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,320
'He owned almost half of Chennai'

691
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,040
'He fared well in business too'

692
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,920
'Wanting to surprise
his wife on her birthday...'

693
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,240
'...he assembled many goldsmiths
from different cities'

694
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,520
'And ordered them to
make an expensive chain'

695
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:43,520
'His wife who wasn't well then
became mentally affected'

696
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,920
'He wrote to his son in Lisbon
asking him to come to India'

697
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,680
'But his son died within days
in an accident in mid sea'

698
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:57,400
'De Monte decided to go
back to his own country'

699
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:00,000
'So he set out to
sell all his assets here'

700
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,360
Take good care of my wife

701
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,280
'He went to Kolkata
to sell his property'

702
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:01,800
'De Monte returned to
Chennai after 5 months'

703
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,040
Sir, I need to tell you something

704
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,240
For the past few weeks...

705
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,400
...madam has been running
a high temperature

706
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,800
She is also suffering
from nausea quite often

707
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,640
I tried different medication

708
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,600
But the fever hasn't lessened

709
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,240
Sir, she hasn't been well
for quite sometime

710
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,920
She has been bleeding
for more than a fortnight

711
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,840
We have tried our best
with all the treatment we know

712
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,840
But there's no improvement

713
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,440
Look here, sir

714
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,880
Guards!

715
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,360
Call the doctor at once

716
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,240
You may leave now

717
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,480
'When De Monte knew
his wife had been raped...'

718
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,600
'...he became mentally unstable'

719
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:09,720
'He told the doctor to keep
this shocking news under wraps'

720
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,600
'But she was insistent...'

721
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:16,720
'...his wife needed to be hospitalized
and treated under sterile conditions'

722
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,560
'Despite the 24x7 security,
if this has happened...'

723
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:12,120
'...someone working in
the house must be guilty'

724
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,560
'Or been an accomplice'

725
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:16,920
'His suspicions turned
into mental instability'

726
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,320
Sir...what happened?

727
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,920
Why did you kill
one of our servants?

728
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:01,200
Sir...don't do anything to me

729
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,520
I won't tell anyone
what happened here

730
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,280
I swear I won't

731
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:07,080
Don't shoot me

732
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,400
Hello...?

733
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,480
Is anyone there?

734
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,320
Servants...?

735
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,520
I can hear a gunshot inside

736
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:57,000
(raised voices in protest)

737
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:07,200
Our men are lying dead inside, bro

738
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:27,000
Some of you go in
through that entrance

739
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,600
Come this side

740
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,360
More than 100 years
since all this happened

741
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,800
But the rumor is De Monte's
spirit is still circling that place

742
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:30,040
And a general fear that anyone
who steps in can't come out alive

743
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:34,600
A Frenchman pooh-poohed this rumor
as rubbish and bought the house

744
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,760
He had the house painted

745
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,200
The workers painted
one whole day

746
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:42,480
The next day they were missing

747
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,120
When the Frenchman enquired...

748
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:49,160
...he found both the painters dead
in their respective houses

749
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:50,800
He locked up his house

750
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,640
And appointed a watchman

751
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,840
The watchman spent
a whole night guarding the place

752
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:58,560
In the morning in the very same chair
he had sat the previous night...

753
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,800
...he was found dead

754
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,640
Look how this future director
spins a scary yarn!

755
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,480
Let's assume what you say is true

756
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,160
We went there last night

757
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,280
We are hale and healthy

758
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:11,000
That's my point exactly

759
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:15,000
We are proof that no such spirits
can spook anyone there

760
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:18,480
Stories blown out of proportion
through passage of time

761
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:24,120
But when you wanted
to go somewhere yesterday...

762
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,640
...I had a specific reason

763
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,680
...in taking you guys
to De Monte colony

764
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:31,160
Remember De Monte ordered
an expensive birthday gift for his wife

765
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:33,400
When I went into extensive
research for my script...

766
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:35,920
...I met an old man who knew
a lot of facts about this house

767
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:38,360
I've lived in this street
for many years

768
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,840
But I've never thought of
stepping in there even once

769
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,720
Have you heard the story
of the 2 painters...

770
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:44,920
...who died inside
that house 10 years ago?

771
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,360
I know

772
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:50,200
They saw the gold chain
De Monte presented to his wife

773
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,840
They stole the chain

774
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,920
After they died, when their families
looked for it, the chain was missing

775
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,840
Not in their houses
Neither was it sold

776
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,000
So where is that chain?

777
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:03,120
If that chain is taken
from De Monte's house...

778
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:07,160
...somehow or the other
it will find its way back

779
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:08,840
What crap!

780
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:10,560
We didn't see
any chain over there

781
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,280
We saw only cobwebs
all over the place

782
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,520
I found it

783
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:33,200
Pendant is made of
Russian alexandrite

784
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,800
Found only in Russia
in the Ural mountains

785
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:39,200
I enquired about this gemstone
without saying it's in our possession

786
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,920
In today's rate
it's worth millions

787
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:43,240
Are you serious?

788
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:46,120
We'll get caught
if we sell it in one shot

789
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:49,560
If we can sell it over a span
of 1 year to various buyers...

790
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:52,280
...we can share and
be settled for life

791
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:53,760
We won't be caught either

792
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:55,080
Isn't it a crime?

793
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:57,240
If we can get over
our hard times...

794
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:59,320
...there's nothing wrong
in what he did

795
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,320
So many are up to
their necks in unlawful acts

796
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:05,680
Do they all get caught?

797
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,640
He didn't steal any jewellery
someone had saved for his wedding

798
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,480
This chain was just lying there

799
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,520
If it can tide over our
tough times, it isn't wrong

800
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,240
Go ahead, Raghava
I'm there for you

801
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:21,160
Srini, give me the chain

802
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,600
Whoever it is, let them
not know about this

803
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:25,200
We'll end up in a soup

804
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,240
What did we do?

805
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,040
Srini, open the door

806
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,480
Sir, delivery from
Midnight Masala

807
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:56,800
Food, huh?

808
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:57,840
How much?

809
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,440
Rs 650, sir

810
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:11,760
If someone has money
you'll make him a pauper!

811
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,680
We have only 50 bucks with us now

812
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,840
As if we won't get
some scapegoat?

813
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,160
Fishermen should not
go into the sea

814
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,880
Storm warning has been announced

815
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,120
Don't loiter around here

816
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,480
Go...go home

817
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:28,880
Should I tell you specially?

818
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:33,040
Why is it raining so heavily
for the past few days?

819
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:37,280
Shall we go out
somewhere tonight too?

820
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:38,280
Hyper chap!

821
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:42,120
I must say it was really thrilling

822
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,240
Sappai would have
pissed in his pants

823
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,000
He matched it
thanks to the rain!

824
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,840
Shall we go now
to De Monte's house?

825
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:50,040
How do you think we can?

826
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,720
With just 50 bucks on us?

827
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:54,800
Let's watch a horror film at home

828
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,280
Why is he suddenly
obsessed with spirits now?

829
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,320
Why not?
Let's watch

830
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,040
Choose a horror movie
from your collection

831
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:02,560
Let me check

832
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:06,720
This laptop is a nuisance

833
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:08,880
Battery never sustains

834
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,520
Annabelle, Ju-on, Conjuring, Exorcis-

835
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:18,600
Oho! This is where
you steal all your ideas from

836
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,600
Don't let your tongue run

837
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:21,640
This is my profession

838
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:23,600
I'm looking for a film
because Srini asked me

839
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,080
You asked for it!

840
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:26,320
Don't get tensed

841
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,840
We'll go with your choice

842
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,400
Let's watch Ju-on

843
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:30,720
Japanese film

844
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:31,600
Worth a watch

845
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,480
Okay, Moshi-moshi!

846
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:37,080
Hey! Why don't we send Sappai
to some sleeping contest?

847
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,320
He might be useful
in bagging 1st prize

848
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,560
Srini, move

849
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:48,000
Oh! You won't sit next to-

850
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:51,200
I forgot
You're a celebrity!

851
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,440
Behaving like school kids

852
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,360
What's the name of the film?

853
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:03,720
Japanese film, huh?

854
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:07,080
Japanese girls will be
flat as a pancake

855
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:08,680
This is a horror film

856
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:09,680
How do you expect-

857
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:12,240
Why won't horror films
show glamorous girls?

858
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:15,160
I think he hasn't seen the 70's
box office hit 'Jagan Mohini'?

859
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:16,600
This is not like Jagan Mohini

860
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:17,880
Shut up and watch

861
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,520
All same bunkum and bull

862
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:14,280
Go and switch off the TV

863
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:29,600
'What's the name of the film?'

864
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:30,880
'Japanese film, huh?'

865
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:33,920
'Japanese girls will be
flat as a pancake'

866
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:35,800
'This is a horror film'

867
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:36,920
'How do you expect-'

868
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,760
'Why won't horror films
show glamorous girls?'

869
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:42,480
'I think he hasn't seen the 70's
box office hit 'Jagan Mohini'?'

870
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:44,000
'This is not like Jagan Mohini'

871
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:45,120
'Shut up and watch'

872
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:47,560
'All same bunkum and bull'

873
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,040
Sit down

874
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:52,400
Let's see what happens next

875
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,520
'Death awaits you!'

876
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:27,760
Where are you going?

877
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:29,160
I'll take a leak
and be right back

878
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:30,160
Okay...okay

879
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:32,400
I swear I just want to pee

880
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:33,680
Srini...?

881
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,120
Srini...?

882
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:30,160
Srini

883
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:40,040
Vimal...?

884
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:45,000
Srini, can you hear me?

885
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:47,520
Hey! Vimal

886
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:49,640
Can you hear me?

887
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,200
Srini

888
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:43,320
Will you take some more time?

889
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:46,440
You go
I'll come

890
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:51,160
It took you so long to say this

891
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:52,160
Come soon

892
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:02,920
What is he doing for so long inside?

893
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,480
Who knows!

894
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:15,120
Srini, shall we eat?

895
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,640
I'm starving

896
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,800
Wait, let him also come

897
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:37,040
Some more peals of thunder like this

898
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:38,840
And our building will collapse

899
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,880
Our walls will crash
even if we just kick it

900
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:44,800
Light that candle

901
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:28,720
What's this?

902
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,680
It's falling from
different directions

903
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:35,920
Raghava, bring another vessel

904
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,120
What are you doing?

905
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:41,160
Hey Raghava...?

906
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:45,080
(Undertone chanting)

907
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:48,560
Raghava?

908
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:51,280
RAGHAVA!

909
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:01,640
What are you up to?

910
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:03,640
Why are you going near him?

911
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:22,160
Please listen

912
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:23,400
Snuff the candle

913
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:25,080
Put it off

914
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,360
What has happened to you?

915
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:29,240
Raghava, listen to me

916
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:58,120
Sajith, wake up

917
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:16,520
Vimal, switch off the TV

918
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:41,520
Pull the plug out

919
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:49,360
Switch on the light

920
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:27,000
- Who are you calling?
- Wait

921
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:32,240
Such a nuisance

922
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:34,920
If it rains, everyone
will start calling here

923
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:37,520
As if I have the power
to restore power

924
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,240
I swear!
Torture

925
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:40,280
Hello Electricity Board

926
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:43,040
Bro, we're calling from B block
of Pattinapakkam housing board

927
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:44,920
No electricity here
Please come at once, bro

928
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:47,360
No, I just got back
from that area

929
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:48,680
Power hasn't been shutdown

930
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:50,480
Not in our place
Please come, bro

931
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:51,840
If there's power shutdown...

932
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:54,040
...will you immediately
call the EB office?

933
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:55,600
Wait for a while

934
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:57,040
Power will be
automatically restored

935
01:09:57,120 --> 01:09:58,120
It's urgent, bro

936
01:09:58,200 --> 01:09:59,160
Please come here

937
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:00,400
I'll pay you whatever you ask

938
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:01,560
Tell him what happened here

939
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:03,280
Oh! You'll pay me whatever I ask

940
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:05,000
Fine, give me your address

941
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:06,760
B block

942
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:10,040
Pattinapakkam

943
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:12,280
What did he say?

944
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:13,520
Is he coming?

945
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:38,280
What is this sound?

946
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:57,040
Look here, brother!

947
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,080
Where's the key?

948
01:10:58,160 --> 01:10:59,200
I gave it to you

949
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:00,160
When?

950
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:01,880
Check again

951
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,320
Yeah, I found it

952
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:52,360
'Srini, can you hear me?'

953
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:54,280
'Look at me'

954
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:56,720
'There's blood stain on his hands'

955
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:09,480
Hello EB

956
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:11,280
Bro, I'm calling from Pattinapakkam

957
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:12,880
I had called you
few minutes ago

958
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:13,760
Where?

959
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:15,120
Pattinapakkam housing board

960
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:15,920
B block

961
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,280
Please come immediately, bro

962
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:19,800
Hey! Are you drunk or what?

963
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:22,000
I was there just a while ago

964
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:24,400
The fuse had blown
and I even fixed it for you

965
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:26,440
Remember, you gave me 50 bucks

966
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,080
Hello...?

967
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:50,760
What happened?

968
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,600
That 50 rupee note is missing

969
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:57,800
And that chap says he was here

970
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:01,120
Something bad is about to happen

971
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:03,040
All that weird stuff
with the TV

972
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:04,560
Bulbs exploding

973
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:05,720
Door is locked

974
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:07,640
We can't even get out

975
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:09,120
That's it

976
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,160
It's all over, right?

977
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:12,920
Be patient please

978
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:15,320
Listen to me

979
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:19,120
After we left the astrologer's place...

980
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:22,640
...he called me

981
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:24,000
He was really flustered

982
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:28,320
When I went back to see him...

983
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:30,600
...he had committed suicide

984
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:32,000
He died?

985
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:33,600
Why didn't you share this with us?

986
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:35,760
I believe he was deep in debt

987
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:38,920
I didn't want to share this

988
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,320
And scare you guys!

989
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:43,000
Looking at the recent events,
I have my own doubts

990
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:46,240
That man was trying
to tell me something

991
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:48,880
But I couldn't hear him properly

992
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,320
Give me your phone

993
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:52,920
Do you have the call recorder
app in your phone?

994
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:53,800
Yes

995
01:13:58,560 --> 01:13:59,680
Tell me

996
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:04,160
'Sonny, I'm the astrologer speaking
I must tell you something important'

997
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:05,120
'Come immediately'

998
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:06,200
'I am half way back home'

999
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:07,800
- 'I'll come another day
- It's urgent'

1000
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:09,640
'I must talk to you
Come right now'

1001
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:11,560
'Just for this, I can't
come to Mogappair'

1002
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:12,880
'I'll come another day'

1003
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,520
'Please listen to me'

1004
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:15,760
'I must definitely talk to you'

1005
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:17,240
'Please come right now'

1006
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:18,640
'You're in great danger'

1007
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:19,520
'Listen to me'

1008
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:21,720
'Sir, no signal
I can't hear a word'

1009
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:24,040
'Your friend Sajith died yesterday'

1010
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:25,360
'I don't know
who is with you'

1011
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:26,840
'Come immediately'

1012
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:28,360
Listen to me carefully

1013
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:32,200
We're unable to open the door

1014
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:35,680
No one from outside
is able to hear us

1015
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:39,000
Let's stay like this until daybreak

1016
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:43,880
Let's hope we get help
from someone tomorrow

1017
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:48,400
Until then let's not sleep

1018
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:50,440
Or go anywhere alone

1019
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:57,400
Vimal?

1020
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:02,000
Don't you want to use the restroom?

1021
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:07,720
Yes, but I won't go

1022
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:10,560
I want to pee now

1023
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:12,800
So...?

1024
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:19,440
Didn't he say none of us should go
anywhere alone till daybreak?

1025
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:22,280
So?

1026
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,160
How much longer will you pee?

1027
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:32,920
It's flowing non stop, dude

1028
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,400
Because I'm terrified

1029
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,080
Why is your face
frozen in fear?

1030
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:08,440
I'm even more terrified
looking at you

1031
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,560
Let's be in the loo
till morning, safer here

1032
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:42,520
Give me your phone

1033
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:45,640
It's switched off

1034
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:46,840
Give me yours

1035
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:49,680
Call one of our boys

1036
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:55,120
(automated message)

1037
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:00,880
You haven't topped up
your phone, huh?

1038
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:01,840
Yes

1039
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:05,320
What about recharge
credit and all that?

1040
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:06,480
I used it all up

1041
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:08,120
Why the hell
do you need a phone?

1042
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:10,000
I can at least get
incoming calls, dude

1043
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:15,360
I have an idea

1044
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:20,400
It can't go wrong

1045
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:21,880
What?

1046
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,040
What's this?

1047
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:40,440
This is called an ouija board

1048
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:43,880
We can communicate
with spirits using this

1049
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:46,040
We can contact spirits

1050
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:48,400
They will answer
any question we ask

1051
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:51,560
How did it come here?

1052
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:58,000
I needed such details
for my script

1053
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:01,840
That's why I got a planchet-

1054
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:03,640
What extent will you
go to for a script?

1055
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:05,080
Look what you've done

1056
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:06,920
Yesterday how many times
he told you not to go there

1057
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:07,880
Did you listen?

1058
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,440
I agree, Srini
What I did was wrong

1059
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:10,520
Why rake up all this?

1060
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:12,040
Let's find a way out first

1061
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:13,080
This will definitely help us

1062
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:13,840
Trust me

1063
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:16,000
I can't believe all this crap
Don't bug me, Raghava

1064
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:17,640
Please listen to me, Srini

1065
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:19,200
I've done a lot of
research on this

1066
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:20,920
Even on the net

1067
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:23,000
Srini, let's give it a shot

1068
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:39,760
Listen to me

1069
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
In a short while
this candle will burn

1070
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:47,320
If it does, there is
a spirit in this room

1071
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:51,000
This coin will move to 'Yes' or 'No'

1072
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:52,840
And answer our questions

1073
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:55,200
Give me your hand

1074
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:58,480
Vimal, hold Srini's hand

1075
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,240
Till I tell you...

1076
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:04,120
...and until all this is over

1077
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:06,520
...don't unclasp your hands

1078
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:35,640
Talk

1079
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:49,560
Talk, man

1080
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:56,880
Are you a good spirit or bad spirit?

1081
01:20:57,800 --> 01:20:59,200
Is this the time to be funny?

1082
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:00,680
That's how we should ask

1083
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,920
A good spirit stands
in the sun's place

1084
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:04,760
And a bad spirit in the moon

1085
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:05,880
Okay, ask

1086
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:12,240
Are you a good spirit
or bad spirit?

1087
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:37,920
Thank God, good spirit

1088
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:45,880
Other than you...

1089
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:49,200
...is there any other
spirit in this room?

1090
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:09,680
Can you somehow help us?

1091
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:19,320
Can you help us escape?

1092
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:25,680
Raghava, this is spooky
Let go of my hand

1093
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:28,880
Will we escape?
Will we be alive?

1094
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:31,760
Raghava, don't be stupid

1095
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:33,320
- Something is wrong
- Wait, Srini

1096
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:35,000
Will we escape?
Will we be alive?

1097
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:36,840
Raghava, let's not
step into the unknown

1098
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:38,280
Listen to me

1099
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:40,080
Let go of my hand

1100
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:46,520
We shouldn't let go
of our hands, Srini

1101
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:47,280
Give me your hand

1102
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:48,240
Burn this goddamn board

1103
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:50,320
You didn't believe me
But I was proved right

1104
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:51,160
Give me your hand

1105
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:52,440
You listen to me
First burn this

1106
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:53,120
We can't do that

1107
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:54,880
Then whoever uses this last will die

1108
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:31,560
This arrow

1109
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:33,160
Whomever it points at...

1110
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:34,920
...will be the 1st to die

1111
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:36,680
Who is it?

1112
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:39,560
Who?

1113
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:04,920
(incoherent muttering)

1114
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:06,400
What's wrong?

1115
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:10,160
Look at our plight!
Being scared of Sajith

1116
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:26,600
Wherever we were sitting...

1117
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,760
...go back to the same spot

1118
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:56,120
Raghava, whom are you talking to?

1119
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:04,280
You don't make sense

1120
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:09,560
Can't hear a word of
what you're saying

1121
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:15,080
What's he saying?

1122
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:16,920
Raghava, can't hear you

1123
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:22,880
Don't come near me

1124
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,080
Stand right there

1125
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:43,880
What are you looking for?

1126
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:05,200
What do you mean?

1127
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:22,000
Raghava...Raghava!

1128
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:28,840
Raghava

1129
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:06,680
Don't understand
what's happening here

1130
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:08,160
I'm petrified, Srini

1131
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:59,680
Vimal, what happened to you?

1132
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:03,640
We'll die

1133
01:32:04,280 --> 01:32:05,400
We'll die for sure

1134
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:06,120
No, Vimal

1135
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:07,160
Listen to me

1136
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:10,000
We'll also die, right?

1137
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:11,880
Hey! Hear me out

1138
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:13,920
Like the way I died on TV...

1139
01:32:14,040 --> 01:32:15,840
...Raghavan is dead inside

1140
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:18,560
We'll also die the same way

1141
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:21,800
Srini, we made a huge blunder

1142
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:24,720
Shouldn't have gone
to De Monte's house

1143
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:26,560
We shouldn't have taken that chain

1144
01:32:27,720 --> 01:32:30,720
Either your eyes or mine
will turn white in a little while

1145
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:32,160
And either you or I will die

1146
01:32:32,240 --> 01:32:33,080
Just a minute

1147
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:34,160
- Listen to me
- I'm so scared

1148
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:35,520
- Look at me
- I'm terrified

1149
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:36,760
Will you let me speak?

1150
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:37,560
Look at me

1151
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,040
We both don't know
anything about that house

1152
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:43,920
We weren't aware of
Raghava's hidden agenda

1153
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,360
We can't be blamed

1154
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:50,680
If you think what we watched
on TV will happen again to us...

1155
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:53,000
...then did you notice
something else?

1156
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:55,600
After you and Raghava died...

1157
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:57,640
...I broke the door and went out

1158
01:32:58,120 --> 01:32:59,680
But I'm unable to
open the door now

1159
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:03,480
That means definitely there is
another way to escape from here

1160
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:06,600
If we can find that,
both of us can escape

1161
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:08,280
Do you understand what I'm saying?

1162
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:20,160
So I'm the one who will die?

1163
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:22,840
You escaped, right?

1164
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:26,920
Why are you scared?

1165
01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:31,160
I don't hear what you're saying?

1166
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:32,680
You won't be able to hear

1167
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:34,000
How can you?

1168
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:38,040
You escaped

1169
01:34:38,120 --> 01:34:40,600
It doesn't matter to you
what happens to me, right?

1170
01:34:40,680 --> 01:34:42,080
You're alive

1171
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:45,480
Srini, I can't hear a word
of what you are saying

1172
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:48,280
You won't...how can you...?

1173
01:34:48,920 --> 01:34:50,760
You are alive

1174
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:52,320
As if you care if I die?

1175
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:54,720
I can't hear a word
of what you're saying

1176
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,760
You won't...you can't

1177
01:34:56,840 --> 01:34:58,640
You won't be able to hear me

1178
01:35:10,680 --> 01:35:11,600
Hey!

1179
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:39,880
Raghava...?

1180
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,600
Raghava...!

1181
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:42,680
Vimal...?

1182
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:56,000
Vimal, I didn't do it deliberately

1183
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,680
How will I ever hit you?

1184
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,640
I swear it wasn't intentional

1185
01:37:05,240 --> 01:37:07,040
Vimal, I didn't
mean to hit you

1186
01:42:31,160 --> 01:42:32,280
Srini...?

1187
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:48,360
Sajith...?!

1188
01:42:54,920 --> 01:42:57,880
How much I begged you guys
not to take me to that house!

1189
01:42:58,400 --> 01:43:01,040
Why did you
drag me in there?

1190
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:04,400
Sajith, I swear
we didn't plan it

1191
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:08,200
We didn't expect
any of this to happen

1192
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:10,760
I'm very scared, Srini

1193
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:13,440
Take me along with you

1194
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:15,080
Sajith, let's go

1195
01:43:17,120 --> 01:43:19,120
I'm so scared, Srini

1196
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:22,000
Take me away
from this place

1197
01:43:22,080 --> 01:43:22,840
Don't be scared

1198
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:24,280
We'll somehow escape

1199
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:28,680
'Your friend Sajith died yesterday'

1200
01:43:28,720 --> 01:43:29,920
'I don't know who is with you'

1201
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:31,000
'Come immediately'

1202
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:38,920
I'm terrified, Srini

1203
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:41,920
Take me from here

1204
01:43:42,840 --> 01:43:44,080
Come here, Sajith

1205
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:45,320
We can leave

1206
01:43:47,400 --> 01:43:49,120
I'm terrified

1207
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:51,840
Take me from here, SRINI

1208
01:43:53,680 --> 01:43:56,280
Srini, get me out of here

1209
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:47,120
Nice place

1210
01:44:47,440 --> 01:44:49,280
But the buyer is
having second thoughts

1211
01:44:49,360 --> 01:44:52,000
2% commission alone
amounts to 2 million

1212
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:52,800
You never know

1213
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:54,120
He might clinch
the deal tomorr-

1214
01:44:54,200 --> 01:44:55,000
Bro, please help

1215
01:44:55,080 --> 01:44:56,520
My friends are
lying dead in my room

1216
01:44:56,600 --> 01:44:57,160
Please help

1217
01:44:57,240 --> 01:44:58,920
Hey! Did you read
the newspaper?

1218
01:44:59,040 --> 01:45:00,560
At 2:00 a.m, a guy
in Thirunelveli...

1219
01:45:00,640 --> 01:45:03,080
...claimed his father
had a heart attack

1220
01:45:03,160 --> 01:45:05,840
He robbed those who rushed
to his aid of their jewellery

1221
01:45:05,880 --> 01:45:07,240
I'm not like that, bro

1222
01:45:07,320 --> 01:45:09,040
Here in nearby Triplicane,
guys called for an auto

1223
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:11,240
They claimed a pregnant lady
needed to be taken to a hospital

1224
01:45:11,320 --> 01:45:14,160
On the way they hit the auto driver
and took the auto with them

1225
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:15,600
These days trying
to help others...

1226
01:45:15,680 --> 01:45:16,840
...is the biggest mistake

1227
01:45:16,920 --> 01:45:20,640
That's why most men prefer
not to lend a helping hand at all

1228
01:45:20,720 --> 01:45:21,920
Yov! How inhuman can you be

1229
01:45:22,040 --> 01:45:23,640
Can't you see how
desperate I am

1230
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:45,120
It's raining cats and dogs

1231
01:45:52,200 --> 01:45:53,920
Looks like this won't stop

1232
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:55,680
Wind up fast
Let's leave

1233
01:47:09,160 --> 01:47:13,080
'Demonte ordered
an expensive chain for his wife'

1234
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:15,240
'Whoever enters that house...'

1235
01:47:15,320 --> 01:47:17,760
'...will end up dead is the rumor'

1236
01:47:17,880 --> 01:47:19,480
'We didn't see
any chain over there'

1237
01:47:19,560 --> 01:47:21,360
'We saw only cobwebs
all over the place'

1238
01:47:21,440 --> 01:47:23,280
'I found it'

1239
01:47:25,080 --> 01:47:28,000
'If that chain is taken out
of De Monte's house...'

1240
01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:31,920
'...somehow or the other
it will find its way back'

1241
