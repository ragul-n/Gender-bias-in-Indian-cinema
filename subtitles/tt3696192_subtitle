1
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:01,754
Raftaar!

2
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:05,158
- Balwinder.
- Coming, brother.

3
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:06,629
Louder..

4
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,022
Father, louder.
Balwinder Yes, brother.

5
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:11,394
Why do I ever pass through this lane?

6
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:14,529
<i>Shitara! Babli! Karan!</i>

7
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:17,234
That Ranjit yells so loudly.

8
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,274
What do you care? Eat your food.
Okay.

9
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:24,672
50,000 rupees is missing
from my cupboard.

10
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:26,307
Sukhi, have you seen it?

11
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:27,746
Ballu?

12
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:29,546
Where's Raftaar?

13
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:30,649
He's been out all morning.

14
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:32,281
The money was here till morning.

15
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:33,483
That's the limit.

16
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,048
Don't you trust your son?

17
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:37,321
No, no... my son can
never do such a thing.

18
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,659
He's my son and your daughter.

19
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,057
Glutton.

20
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:43,225
Raftaar was always useless
and good-for-nothing...

21
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:44,768
and now he's also become a thief.

22
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:48,198
No, uncle, Raftaar can never steal.

23
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:52,038
Sister, I saw brother in front
of the cupboard in the morning.

24
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,408
Come here, dear.

25
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:55,408
Children never lie.

26
00:03:57,136 --> 00:03:58,342
Now repeat what you said.

27
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:02,147
I saw father in the morning.

28
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,016
What?

29
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:05,012
You heard it wrong.

30
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,388
I said father, not brother.

31
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:11,019
Don't try to protect him.

32
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,620
I know my son too well.

33
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,498
And there goes the gun...

34
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:15,658
The race has begun!

35
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:17,258
Look at how they are racing.

36
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:18,495
Towards the end line.

37
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:22,267
And they have reached the end-line..

38
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:33,181
"Boys, the winning team gets."

39
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:35,048
"A cash reward and a Bullet."

40
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,179
"And the losing team
gets Lots of love."

41
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:57,807
"it goes tung-tung."

42
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,274
"it goes tung-tung."

43
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:07,011
"it sounds like tung-tung."

44
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,182
"it sounds like tung-tung."

45
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:13,315
"The stringed instrument."

46
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,586
"In your and my heart,
it plays loud."

47
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,753
"This stringed instrument today."

48
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:20,156
"In your and my heart,
it plays loud."

49
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:22,358
"This stringed instrument today."

50
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:25,028
"it goes tung-tung."

51
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:29,632
"it goes tung-tung."

52
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:34,138
"it sounds like tung-tung."

53
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:38,242
"it sounds like tung-tung."

54
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:40,443
"The stringed instrument."

55
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,679
"In your and my heart,
it plays loud."

56
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:45,018
"This stringed instrument today."

57
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:47,285
"In your and my heart,
it plays loud."

58
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,588
"This stringed instrument today."

59
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,220
"A beautiful atmosphere is set."

60
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:55,390
"Damsels are dancing."

61
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:59,063
"Now I will... Pull the tractor
with my teeth and show you."

62
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:16,653
"Bravo.."

63
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:20,020
"Gungh-gungh, it goes."

64
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,251
"The drum speaks."

65
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:24,420
"Gungh-gungh, it goes."

66
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:25,690
"And the heart skips a beat."

67
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:29,097
"Gungh-gungh, it goes."

68
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:30,225
"The drum speaks."

69
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:33,566
"Gungh-gungh, it goes."

70
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:35,037
"And the heart skips a beat."

71
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:38,541
"Then the drum revealed..."

72
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,469
"Then the drum revealed..."

73
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,775
"Look how well they dance!"

74
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:46,107
"Then the drum revealed..."

75
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:48,379
"All the secrets of
stringed instrument."

76
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,512
"Amidst the drum and
the stringed instrument."

77
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,385
"Without me, alone"

78
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:55,289
"how will you"

79
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,156
"it sounds like tung-tung."

80
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,263
"it sounds like tung-tung."

81
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:08,496
"Along with the Gungh-gungh."

82
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:10,734
"In your and my heart,
it plays loud."

83
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:13,136
"This stringed instrument today."

84
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,304
"In your and my heart,
it plays loud."

85
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:17,507
"This stringed instrument today."

86
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,743
"In your and my heart.."

87
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:21,679
"In your and my heart.."

88
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:24,621
"In your and my heart,
it plays loud."

89
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:33,018
"Oh ring,
the trees are bearing fruits."

90
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,021
"My beloved stays far away."

91
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,464
"Oh ring, listen to me, I pray."

92
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:40,664
"I tried hard to make him stay."

93
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:21,635
Why aren't you dancing now?

94
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:25,342
This is what you're good for.

95
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:26,576
You're good for nothing.

96
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,243
It didn't matter
that he humiliated me.

97
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:30,116
But why did he have
to humiliate himself?

98
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,018
What?

99
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:31,985
Yes.

100
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,218
And he even kicked me.

101
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,090
It's true you're useless,
good-for-nothing.

102
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:39,425
These villagers
know how to have fun..

103
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:41,328
But they also work hard.

104
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:44,400
But all you do is party hard.

105
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:47,730
When will you realize
your responsibilities?

106
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:49,337
Get lost.

107
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:53,600
All you do is hog food all day,
squander money.

108
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,010
Let me see you earn a single penny.

109
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:58,245
Go find a job.

110
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:00,347
Are you listening or not?

111
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,713
Curse you... I'll teach you a lesson.

112
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,683
If you can even clean the
cow-shed properly everyday..

113
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:07,652
I wouldn't have to worry.

114
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:09,252
- Mom..
- Yeah!

115
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:12,159
Father was saying
that I hog all day.

116
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:15,199
Do I really hog all day?

117
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:18,696
No, son... you don't hog all day.

118
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,571
Your eyelids are flickering,
you're lying.

119
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,631
Yours are too.

120
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:26,677
I did everything only for
the betterment of the village.

121
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,643
- Tell her.
- He's right.

122
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:30,408
This is the first time
when father taunted me..

123
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:32,005
For my unemployment.

124
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:33,978
He must have said it
in a fit of rage.

125
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:36,282
No...

126
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:37,377
Mom.

127
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:39,384
I swear...

128
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:44,690
Look here. - Yes.
I swear... that I will find a job.

129
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,751
Just wait a watch.

130
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:04,242
Raftaar! Raftaar!

131
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:05,543
I completely forgot.

132
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,685
Today's the last day of
admission in my son's school.

133
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:09,311
And the Mayor's coming today.

134
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,335
For the inauguration
ceremony of the African Lion.

135
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:14,257
Please help me out. Please.
Of course, anything for friends.

136
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:15,153
What do I have to do?

137
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:18,526
You have to guard the African Lion.

138
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,789
Mr. Lion, can you spare two minutes.
Someone wants to meet you.

139
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:23,459
Here. Here.

140
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:24,694
Singh... Lion!

141
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:27,262
Lion... Singh!

142
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:30,061
Who is it now?

143
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:30,733
Oh God!

144
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:31,836
I'm on my way, 15 minutes.

145
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:33,236
15 minutes...

146
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,279
The Mayor and other
bureaucrats will be attending.

147
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:36,711
Just handle everything.
Lam coming.

148
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:38,077
15 minutes.
- Listen.

149
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,547
Come soon.

150
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:44,781
The door is open.

151
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:48,450
Mufasa!

152
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:51,618
Where did he go?

153
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:54,496
Mufasa! Mufasa!

154
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,735
Hello, sir... Welcome.

155
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:01,032
Oh no...

156
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:02,094
Mufasa!

157
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,328
Wonderful! Wonderful!

158
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:27,659
Calm down! Calm down!

159
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:31,257
Punjab, the land of Lions!

160
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:33,701
And especially from Africa..

161
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:38,037
We've brought a lion for you,
which will..

162
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:39,771
Make you hold your breaths.

163
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:43,375
Mr. Mayor, hold this.

164
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,171
Sorry.

165
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:51,784
Clap!

166
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:09,039
Did the lion walk
all the way from Africa?

167
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:10,436
Looks humiliating.

168
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:13,272
When this lion roars...

169
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:20,341
it makes people shiver.

170
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:25,487
They shudder... shudder with fear.

171
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:29,751
Security...
make him roar for the people.

172
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:36,589
Security... tell him to roar!

173
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:39,397
- Him?
- Yes, him.

174
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:48,203
It's a dog!

175
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,803
Yes...

176
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:55,044
That's not a lion!

177
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:03,016
You... That's a dog.

178
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,618
I will put you in a cage.

179
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:08,255
Move the cameras, what are you doing?
Who called the press here?

180
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,163
I won't spare you.

181
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:13,135
No, photographs.
I will have this dog bite you.

182
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:14,398
You'll be injected..

183
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,098
What if the lion doesn't return?

184
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:18,108
I want the lion back.

185
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:20,668
Hey... stop. Stop.

186
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,146
You and your plans.

187
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:34,453
The person you're trying
to call is driving at the moment.

188
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:36,493
Please call next month..

189
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,222
- Raftaar.
- Yes.

190
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:39,684
I gave you such a small job to do..

191
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:40,628
But you messed that up too.

192
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:44,055
It wasn't my fault,
you left the cage door open.

193
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:45,592
You could've closed the door.

194
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,729
Wasn't much to do.
What is this?

195
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,071
Do something... find the lion..

196
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,301
And bring him before the Mayor.

197
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:53,309
Where will I find him?
Just find him from anywhere..

198
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:54,537
Or else I will lose my job.

199
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,375
But I am losing mine too.

200
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:57,743
I am going...

201
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,508
Everyone's troubling me.

202
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:01,552
Listen... He hung up.

203
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:06,021
This must be the first
lion that cost me my job.

204
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:09,251
What kind of remix is this?

205
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:41,148
You dressed up a
dog to look like a lion.

206
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,489
Isn't this misguiding
the innocent people?

207
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,687
The country wants to know.

208
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:48,197
I.. - Mr. Mayor, will you appoint
a committee to find the lion?

209
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:50,325
One minute...

210
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,436
- Hello..
- Mayor sir.

211
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,666
How dare you come here?

212
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,039
I warned you..

213
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:05,278
Sir, I've brought him along.
What?

214
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:06,213
Donkey?

215
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:09,675
Lion, sir.

216
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,088
Are you crazy?

217
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:16,524
Come, Mufasa. Come.

218
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:21,493
You climbed on
the table out of fear.

219
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:22,623
Don't be scared, sir.

220
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:25,225
He's a very tame lion,
even I was scared of him first.

221
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,100
Why did you bring him here?

222
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:31,005
Listen to me. Look at him,
he already likes you a lot.

223
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,737
Look, he's even apologizing.

224
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:34,170
He's staring at me.

225
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:37,612
Mommy!
Sir, please don't fire my friend.

226
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,206
I won't fire your friend.
I will give him my job.

227
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,147
I'll make him the Mayor.

228
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:41,741
Don't joke with me, sir.

229
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:43,368
Mommy!
You can keep your lion, sir.

230
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:46,481
Listen to me, take him away.
All of you, please explain my sir.

231
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:48,115
Someone give a bone to the lion.

232
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:50,760
Mayor sir, you keep him.

233
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:53,121
- Mayor sir.
- I beg you...

234
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:55,756
Listen to me,
even I was scared at first.

235
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:58,557
He's fainted. See you.

236
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,366
I am tying him here, keep him.

237
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:02,497
Okay...

238
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:03,700
Hello.

239
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:05,064
See you all.

240
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:07,301
Brother, listen to me.

241
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:09,704
Mommy!

242
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:11,976
He's made my life hell.

243
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:14,348
I cannot tolerate him anymore.

244
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:16,613
I cannot stay here any longer.

245
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:18,518
Eat your food quietly.

246
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:21,114
That's all I'm good for these days.

247
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,183
If you can't make us proud..

248
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:24,922
Then at least don't humiliate us.

249
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,496
You shouldn't be even
let out of your room.

250
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:29,226
Harpeet...
Please don't advocate him.

251
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:31,128
Come. Go to your room.

252
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,500
And you won't get
food all day today.

253
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:39,002
Save this pretence for
someone who doesn't know you two.

254
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,670
You've never completed anything.

255
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:46,216
You left your studies in between.

256
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:47,872
Stopped working in
the fields in mid-way.

257
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,281
Quit your job in the middle.

258
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,719
But now you must
completely leave home.

259
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:53,279
- Understand.
- You're right...

260
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,653
"If you ever make
such a mistake again"

261
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:56,047
you will have to leave home.

262
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:58,585
No... he has to go now.

263
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:01,128
What are you saying?

264
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,097
You have only two options.

265
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:06,364
Either you take up a decent
job at my friend's place in Goa.

266
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:09,235
Or marry Navjot's daughter Sweety.

267
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:10,466
Understand?

268
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:11,697
Yes.

269
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:26,616
Raftaar.

270
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:31,726
He wants me to marry a girl...
that's only good for wrestling.

271
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:34,092
There are no options.

272
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:40,431
Mom. Why are you crying?

273
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,596
Don't you know your father?

274
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:45,108
Once he's decided something...

275
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,031
What does he want?

276
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:48,306
That I should go to Goa?

277
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:50,204
I'll go happily.

278
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:54,708
Come on..

279
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,089
God bless you.

280
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:03,417
I hope you won't quit
this job in the middle?

281
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,430
"You don't lack anything"

282
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:08,259
except for concentration.

283
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:11,427
I am not sending you
away because I've lost.

284
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,094
I am sending you away because I know..

285
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:15,229
You're capable of doing much more.

286
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:17,501
And I want you to recognize yourself.

287
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:20,671
If you delay,
you have a lot to lose.

288
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,478
Understand.

289
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:24,179
Now go.

290
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,485
Welcome... son, welcome.

291
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:33,022
Father, he's leaving.

292
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:08,453
Hello, Mr. Rana?

293
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,427
I am arriving at your
stud farm for a meeting.

294
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:05,341
I'm too good.

295
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:07,213
Welcome, Gentlemen.

296
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:09,252
Just because we're
in the weapon's business..

297
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:12,255
"Does not mean we've
to be at war with each other."

298
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:14,582
Let's divide our territories.

299
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:17,559
Mr. Nelson, you take eastern Europe.

300
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:19,653
Mr. Wong, you take Asia.

301
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:21,156
And you sir, Russia.

302
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,460
Anthony, my friend.

303
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,726
Africa's yours.

304
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,763
This is the only
way to stop bloodshed.

305
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:29,198
No loss of profit,
no loss of life.

306
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,137
Deal.

307
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:37,407
That's the spirit.

308
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:39,043
Cheers.

309
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,744
Cheers to our unity.

310
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:41,511
Cheers.

311
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:44,753
I like the way you ride...

312
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,081
the horse.

313
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,288
Hi!

314
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:55,256
I love the way you smell.

315
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,068
And your calves are just...

316
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,379
Don't ever try
to act smart with me.

317
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:15,174
Sorry, Mr. Rana.

318
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:29,554
Sorry.

319
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:39,372
I can't tolerate anyone
misbehaving with my daughter.

320
00:23:38,283 --> 00:23:39,193
Mark!

321
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:43,761
Mark!

322
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:55,509
Dad. Dad.

323
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,180
- You...
- No, no, no, dad.

324
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:00,978
How can I kill you?

325
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:03,111
That's why I told him to kill you.

326
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:05,712
But this really pains me.

327
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:08,218
But it was more painful..

328
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,988
When you asked me to
apologies in front of everyone.

329
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:14,327
You've grown old, dad.

330
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:17,326
That's why you're happy
with the little you have.

331
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,694
But I want to make it big, dad.

332
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:24,200
I want total control, dad.

333
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:27,569
Dad! Hey dad! Dad! Dad!

334
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:30,440
It's best you die, dad.

335
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:32,375
Good for you.

336
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:35,314
Better for me.

337
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:39,719
- Dad...
- Sir, he's dead.

338
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,058
I'm too good.

339
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:54,668
It's my time, dad.

340
00:24:58,296 --> 00:25:00,207
Sara, Mark has gone mad.

341
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:02,211
You must leave for the US.

342
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:03,473
I won't go to the US.

343
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:05,674
Darling, it's only until
all this gets sorted out.

344
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:07,004
You'll be safe there.

345
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,349
Even now you want
to get rid of your problem..

346
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:11,011
And not face it.

347
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,750
I'll go wherever I want to.

348
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:22,129
I know where Sara will go.

349
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,632
Call Kirpal.

350
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:55,624
I know who sent the money and why.

351
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:00,632
You just rejected
500 million in 5 seconds.

352
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,367
Such an expensive mistake.

353
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:03,269
Out!

354
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:06,332
Piku, that old man refused
an offer of 500 million.

355
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,537
I wonder what the boss
is going to do with him?

356
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,617
Hello. Wrong number.
It's just a phone.

357
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:19,079
Come on.

358
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:20,984
Stop.

359
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:22,389
We're guest of Mr. Kirpal.

360
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:23,323
Okay, hold.

361
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:24,553
Sir, two men are here to see you.

362
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:26,095
And one Sardar.

363
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:28,264
- You mean three people.
- Yes.

364
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,458
Send them upstairs.

365
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:31,125
Send them upstairs.

366
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:32,232
On the deck.

367
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,292
I am not your father's friend.

368
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:36,768
This is the address father gave me.

369
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:40,032
Hey... First listen to me.

370
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:43,370
I mean I am your father's friend..

371
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,210
But out here I am your boss.

372
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,112
Ha... Ha...

373
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:47,673
- Who are these two?
- Friends.

374
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:48,779
You two stand at the back.

375
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,610
Go and stand at the back.

376
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,755
And you...
stand at the end of this line.

377
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:53,580
Yes.

378
00:26:57,215 --> 00:27:00,094
Do you know how much
time it takes to get her?

379
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:05,061
5 seconds if I walk.

380
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,737
And 2 seconds if I run.

381
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:14,272
You must do as I say.

382
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:15,709
That's what father said too.

383
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:18,106
There's a rule to get
recruited here. - What?

384
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:20,342
Go to that railing and jump.

385
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:27,622
What did you do?

386
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,681
Boss said
"Go to that railing and jump".

387
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:31,016
And I did.

388
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,028
'Go to that railing and jump.'

389
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:41,561
He's smart!

390
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:51,279
Raftaar, I'm giving
you a very important job.

391
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:53,309
You need to go to Goa airport.

392
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:54,145
Yes.

393
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:57,113
Take this.

394
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,381
A girl called Sara...

395
00:27:58,576 --> 00:28:01,216
- Singh. Where?
- Goa airport.

396
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,656
Come back.

397
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:07,127
First hear me out.

398
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:09,329
You've to be at the
airport tomorrow 11 am.

399
00:28:09,387 --> 00:28:11,298
But there's lot of
time for that. - Yeah.

400
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,562
Sit.

401
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:16,537
Listen to me carefully, son.

402
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:19,441
A girl called Sara
is arriving from Romania.

403
00:28:19,497 --> 00:28:20,669
She's my guest.

404
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:24,610
You'll be with her
until she goes back.

405
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:26,205
And take good care of her.

406
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:29,451
She doesn't know Hindi,
do you know English?

407
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:30,417
No.

408
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,015
You don't know English?

409
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:36,285
What are you doing here?

410
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,152
What are you doing in Goa?
Get lost.

411
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:39,593
Go back to Punjab.
Back to Punjab!

412
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,670
Come on.

413
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:51,434
Come on.

414
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:54,735
I do know English.

415
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:56,137
A to Z.

416
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:58,044
Good.

417
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:01,574
Keys to the Panjim bungalow.

418
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:06,447
I'm giving you this
because I trust you.

419
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:07,717
Don't worry, sir.

420
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:10,452
Even I trust myself completely.

421
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:11,620
Jai Hind!

422
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:13,961
What a character.

423
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:23,166
Hey, Singh. Get the key.

424
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,205
Stupid.

425
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:36,686
I lied... that I know English.

426
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,183
I don't know what to do.

427
00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:44,186
I'll arrange for someone...
who knows Hindi and English.

428
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:45,353
Don't worry.

429
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:46,560
Let's go ahead.

430
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,562
Come on.

431
00:29:58,429 --> 00:29:59,237
Careful.

432
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,470
Aunty, brother Daljeet's calling.

433
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:03,444
Son... how are you?

434
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:05,139
Nothing's good out here, mom.

435
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:07,509
Neither the food,
nor the place or the ambiance.

436
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:10,008
I haven't even slept
properly since I got here.

437
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:12,317
You haven't slept? Are you sick?

438
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:15,017
I could never sleep
without hearing your voice.

439
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:17,692
Then call me every night.

440
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:19,524
I can't see your face on the phone.

441
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:21,757
I maybe here,
but I'm still with you.

442
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:25,063
Concentrate on your job,
and everything will be fine.

443
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:27,563
Fine, mom. Take care.

444
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:35,237
Raftaar, my room's really amazing.

445
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,213
He's sad and you're dancing.

446
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:44,150
Sorry, bro.

447
00:31:54,812 --> 00:31:56,723
- Hi.
- Hi.

448
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:15,033
Now she will come.

449
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:17,144
- Band.
- Let them go.

450
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:18,708
Go, Go.

451
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,258
You idiots,
you're here to receive me.

452
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:36,027
Raftaar... insult.

453
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:39,524
We're here to receive you,
doesn't mean we're your servants.

454
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,399
What you did with him..

455
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,564
If you do it again...

456
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:45,707
You'll face my wrath.

457
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:46,639
Yes,

458
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:54,050
Raftaar, you two look
really nice together.

459
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:19,571
She's a guest, not my type.

460
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:23,239
This girl's got an attitude problem.

461
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:25,645
I'll show her. Wear your belt.

462
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:30,119
Raftaar, get ready.

463
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,692
"You kicked me out of this Casino"

464
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:12,619
and now I'm offering to buy it.

465
00:34:12,683 --> 00:34:15,129
And this time my offer is 750 million.

466
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:18,292
I threw you out because
you got involved in drugs.

467
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:21,402
And now you want to buy
my Casino with that money.

468
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:23,028
You think I'll let that happen.

469
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:28,472
Hey, stop.

470
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:31,147
I want to meet Kirpal.
You can't.

471
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:32,203
He's in a meeting with Boxer Bhai.

472
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,510
What about him?

473
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:40,314
Who's the girl?

474
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:41,413
She wants to meet Kirpal.

475
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:43,049
- What?
- She's from Romania.

476
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:45,418
Next time there won't be an offer...

477
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:47,057
I'll just help myself in.

478
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:47,686
Wait.

479
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:56,066
Your time is up.

480
00:34:56,594 --> 00:35:00,667
You should retire, go to
Canada and buy a mall or something.

481
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:28,003
How is your father?

482
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:30,035
Good.

483
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:31,634
I thought you're
not safe in the hotel..

484
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:33,403
So I put you in my bungalow.

485
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:35,543
Thank you.

486
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,676
If you have any problem,
you can tell Singh.

487
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:45,613
Don't worry,
I'll take care of myself.

488
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,454
He may be silly but
he's very dependable.

489
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:10,739
Insulted again.

490
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:16,716
That's our bag!

491
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:22,691
Stop. Stop the car.

492
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:27,189
This is your room.

493
00:36:27,251 --> 00:36:30,425
It's got a balcony..
Cupboard...

494
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:31,694
Bathroom...

495
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:37,706
Did you show her, her room?

496
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,607
She's got an attitude.

497
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:41,371
Keep her away from me.

498
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:42,534
Hey...

499
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:45,675
Your room's that way.

500
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:47,443
What are you doing here?
Raftaar.

501
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,276
That girl left her room..

502
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,147
She's here.

503
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:56,019
Open the door,
don't make me mad.

504
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,056
See.

505
00:36:58,583 --> 00:36:59,493
See.

506
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:00,991
I'll show her.

507
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:11,503
Why does my future seem
in the dark?

508
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:16,605
This girl isn't
taking us seriously.

509
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:18,146
I'll show her.

510
00:37:22,506 --> 00:37:25,749
Stop the truck. My bag.

511
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,683
Stop.

512
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:52,205
Sir, Sara has left Romania..

513
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,716
And nobody knows which
part of the world she's in.

514
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,445
That's good news.

515
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:57,383
You know...

516
00:37:57,441 --> 00:38:02,049
If she had been here,
I would've caught her and killed her.

517
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:03,381
Finish!

518
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:05,625
No glamour.

519
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:08,361
Easy is boring man.

520
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:15,302
She'll hide and I'll find her.

521
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,607
She'll run and I'll hunt her.

522
00:38:21,365 --> 00:38:22,309
I like it.

523
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,349
This is an old way
to show-off your brawn.

524
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,252
But it's effective.

525
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:38,085
Come on.

526
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:48,732
You and you...
scream when I say.

527
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,370
- Get it.
- Yes.

528
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:09,991
She's coming.

529
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:11,321
And now...

530
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:12,622
Hit me.

531
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,390
Wait... that's the fake one, right?

532
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:15,226
Yes, it's fake.

533
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:16,629
That's the real one.

534
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,360
That's the real one. Okay.

535
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,098
Hit me.

536
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:40,188
Now it's my turn.

537
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:43,024
Come here, and turn around.

538
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,758
Be strong. Be strong.

539
00:40:13,377 --> 00:40:16,153
I was here for the
job of a translator.

540
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:17,453
I guess I am at the wrong address.

541
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:18,118
Hey!

542
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:19,684
Hey specky, come here.

543
00:40:22,486 --> 00:40:25,729
Drink Rasna...
it'll cool your mind.

544
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:36,710
It's cool.

545
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:38,479
Bye!

546
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,746
Hi.

547
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:45,253
What's your name?

548
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:46,219
Emily.

549
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:48,281
Imli?

550
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,318
That's a tart name.

551
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:54,685
Ask her...
what's she doing in Goa?

552
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:57,155
Why have you come to Goa?

553
00:40:57,221 --> 00:40:59,064
It's none of his business.

554
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:01,296
'She'll get herself
killed and me too.'

555
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:07,509
She... likes to see new places,
eat new food..

556
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:10,011
And make new friends.

557
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:11,513
She's here to make friends.

558
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:14,280
Does she know all of us?

559
00:41:15,105 --> 00:41:16,641
Do you know who they are?

560
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:22,223
Morons! Three morons.

561
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:27,691
Great... great people.

562
00:41:30,554 --> 00:41:32,431
The idea's working.

563
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,730
Did she understand?
Do you want to call the cops?

564
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:37,705
Hey... don't try to get too friendly.

565
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:40,708
Tell her... if she needs
to get anything done in Goa..

566
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:42,766
Then speak to me.

567
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:50,051
Let's go.

568
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:55,088
If you want anything done...
he can do anything in Goa.

569
00:42:00,584 --> 00:42:02,393
But what do we
do with this woman?

570
00:42:02,586 --> 00:42:06,500
She wants you to help
her find this woman.

571
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:09,500
Tell her not to worry,
it'll be clone.

572
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,504
Tell her.

573
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:13,338
He said don't worry...
he will help you find her.

574
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:14,572
<i>Pappi.</i>

575
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:16,443
Take a look.

576
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:18,707
Show him as well.

577
00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:23,008
You will have to worry
if you don't find her.

578
00:42:23,741 --> 00:42:25,243
I will break your bones.

579
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:35,520
She has faith in
your strong shoulders.

580
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:41,196
- Raftaar!
- Raftaar!

581
00:42:43,427 --> 00:42:46,271
What? - We're hungry,
how about we get something to eat.

582
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:51,577
She said... she likes
to see new places.

583
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:54,546
Let's take her out,
let's eat out.

584
00:42:54,605 --> 00:42:55,413
- Yes.
- Let's go.

585
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:12,998
Why the hell
is he blushing so much?

586
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:14,762
What did she say?

587
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:19,571
She's saying you've got
the best smile she's ever seen.

588
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:24,236
Got her! Got her! Got her!

589
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,442
Tell her she's very beautiful.

590
00:43:31,508 --> 00:43:33,181
Jesus, what did you get me into?

591
00:43:33,243 --> 00:43:35,154
Come on... tell her now.
Tell her...

592
00:43:36,513 --> 00:43:40,017
Tell her.
He says you're very beautiful.

593
00:43:42,686 --> 00:43:46,224
If he flirts with me...
I will kick him.

594
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:54,634
What did she say?

595
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:57,710
She expects a lot from you.

596
00:43:58,168 --> 00:44:00,045
She's got great hopes.

597
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,178
A

598
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:05,209
Hope.

599
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:08,490
Have you got money?

600
00:44:08,545 --> 00:44:10,149
I didn't bring my purse.

601
00:44:10,214 --> 00:44:11,318
Raftaar's got...

602
00:44:11,382 --> 00:44:13,384
Raftaar! Raftaar!

603
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:14,520
Raftaar!

604
00:44:14,585 --> 00:44:16,258
- Raftaar!
- Raftaar!

605
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:18,427
He's lost in his dreams again.

606
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:20,662
Let's follow him
and take Imli along.

607
00:44:20,724 --> 00:44:22,328
What? Why?

608
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:24,498
You'll explain Raftaar's song to Sara.

609
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:25,539
Come on.

610
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:26,472
"Beat!"

611
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:33,714
"Banjo."

612
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:41,054
"Sing."

613
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:48,163
"Singh... Sing."

614
00:44:48,218 --> 00:44:52,030
"Baby your love's
completely floored me."

615
00:44:52,056 --> 00:44:55,367
"Don't make me wait too long."

616
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:02,442
"After locking my eyes with yours."

617
00:45:02,499 --> 00:45:06,174
"I've entered the game of love."

618
00:45:06,236 --> 00:45:09,376
"He wants to say...
that he loves you well."

619
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,252
"Now you got to tell
him something too."

620
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:16,587
"In every way,
I just want to say."

621
00:45:16,647 --> 00:45:20,288
"That you are the one,
baby I love you."

622
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:23,024
"Hearing you agree..."

623
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,190
"My heart goes..."

624
00:45:26,523 --> 00:45:27,695
"My heart goes..."

625
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:31,297
"My heart goes..."

626
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:35,243
"My heart says..."

627
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:38,505
"My heart says..."

628
00:45:41,038 --> 00:45:42,210
"My heart says..."

629
00:45:59,223 --> 00:45:59,792
"Bro..."

630
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:03,163
"You seem like an angel to me."

631
00:46:03,227 --> 00:46:07,004
"Your voice casts a spell on me."

632
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:13,745
"I just see an angel baby,
whenever I look at you."

633
00:46:13,971 --> 00:46:17,544
"When I hear your magic
it's making me crazy too."

634
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:21,613
"I'm going to hold
you tight in my arms."

635
00:46:21,678 --> 00:46:25,216
"Just keep staring
at me with a smile."

636
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:28,024
"After falling
in love with you.."

637
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:29,358
"My heart goes..."

638
00:46:31,355 --> 00:46:32,595
"My heart goes..."

639
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:36,197
"My heart goes..."

640
00:46:38,529 --> 00:46:39,633
"My heart goes..."

641
00:46:42,232 --> 00:46:43,267
"My heart goes..."

642
00:46:45,669 --> 00:46:47,012
"My heart goes..."

643
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:50,611
"Let it go.."

644
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:52,286
"Let it go.."

645
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:55,050
"Sway to the beat
and lets sing and dance."

646
00:46:55,112 --> 00:46:56,022
"Let it go.."

647
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:57,591
"Let it go.."

648
00:46:58,582 --> 00:46:59,526
"Let it go.."

649
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:01,290
"Sway to the beat and.."

650
00:47:01,351 --> 00:47:02,056
"Don't stop."

651
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:02,688
"Let it go.."

652
00:47:02,953 --> 00:47:05,695
"Your intoxication.."

653
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:07,999
"Bro... take it slow."

654
00:47:08,058 --> 00:47:11,403
"My queen,
this is the grandeur of your king."

655
00:47:11,461 --> 00:47:15,409
"Only you look good alongside
this handsome Singh."

656
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:20,409
"I'm your king,
and you're my queen.."

657
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:22,381
"..and that's the
way it's supposed to be."

658
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:24,009
"Now you're standing
with your Singh.."

659
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:26,178
"..because you look
best when you're with me."

660
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:30,114
"With your beautiful
face dwelling in my eyes."

661
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:33,252
<i>"I'll</i> drench you in
the color of my love."

662
00:47:33,317 --> 00:47:36,298
"Your intoxication
gets me high.."

663
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:37,491
"My heart goes..."

664
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,033
"My heart goes..."

665
00:47:43,393 --> 00:47:44,371
"My heart goes..."

666
00:47:46,997 --> 00:47:48,135
"My heart goes..."

667
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:51,672
"My heart goes..."

668
00:47:54,271 --> 00:47:55,375
"My heart goes..."

669
00:48:04,581 --> 00:48:07,391
Aunty, brother Daljeet's calling.

670
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:11,532
How are you?
Fine, mom. How about you?

671
00:48:11,588 --> 00:48:13,124
You sound really happy.

672
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:14,533
That's Goa, mom.

673
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,002
It's a wonderful place.

674
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:17,663
Different dawn, different evening..

675
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,674
Different food, different people.

676
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,368
Everything. I'm having fun.

677
00:48:21,431 --> 00:48:23,001
- Who's the girl?
- Sara.

678
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:23,635
Huh?

679
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,681
Mom, don't you have
anything better to do?

680
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:29,541
I'm here to work,
not to stare at girls.

681
00:48:29,606 --> 00:48:31,085
I'm your mom.

682
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:33,417
You're away from my sights,
but not my thoughts.

683
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:34,649
Amazing, mom.

684
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:36,452
I can never hide
anything from you.

685
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,400
Nor does she hide anything.

686
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:52,035
Listen... send me
a picture immediately.

687
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:55,406
My picture.
The girl. I mean you two together.

688
00:48:55,465 --> 00:48:56,500
Yes, I will.

689
00:49:11,481 --> 00:49:13,085
"My heart goes..."

690
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:16,426
"My heart goes..."

691
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:20,299
"My heart goes..."

692
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:23,962
"My heart goes..."

693
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:27,407
"My heart goes..."

694
00:49:29,566 --> 00:49:31,273
"My heart goes..."

695
00:49:54,024 --> 00:49:55,002
Oh!

696
00:49:59,096 --> 00:50:00,734
The food and music here is nice.

697
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:01,635
Tell her.

698
00:50:01,698 --> 00:50:04,008
This place has superb food and music.

699
00:50:04,034 --> 00:50:07,140
Stop, stop... where are you going?
Let go.

700
00:50:07,204 --> 00:50:09,480
Let's have fun,
let's eat and drink.

701
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:11,018
Stop.

702
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:12,042
Let me go.

703
00:50:12,142 --> 00:50:14,144
It's a moonlit night.
I'll call the police.

704
00:50:14,211 --> 00:50:16,191
Leave me.

705
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:20,355
Where do you want to go?

706
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:22,395
Just say yes.

707
00:50:22,452 --> 00:50:26,195
Let's take them along.
Catch her.

708
00:50:26,256 --> 00:50:27,736
You're just standing
here and staring.

709
00:50:28,225 --> 00:50:29,704
What if it was
your sister instead?

710
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,068
Idiot staring...

711
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:34,367
Do you feel angry?

712
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,706
Vent it out on them instead of me.

713
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:38,669
What?

714
00:50:38,735 --> 00:50:40,043
What's your name?

715
00:50:40,437 --> 00:50:41,711
- What?
- Name.

716
00:50:41,772 --> 00:50:42,807
Vaidehi Joshi.

717
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,577
Maharashtrian?
Then you must have strong hands.

718
00:50:46,676 --> 00:50:47,450
Let's see...

719
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:51,084
Come on... we'll have fun.
Drink some...

720
00:50:51,148 --> 00:50:53,219
Come on, we'll have fun.

721
00:50:53,283 --> 00:50:54,318
What?

722
00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:03,203
See... your finger prints
can be seen on his face.

723
00:51:03,693 --> 00:51:06,037
"If your hands are so strong"

724
00:51:06,096 --> 00:51:08,042
then imagine how
strong your legs are.

725
00:51:09,266 --> 00:51:10,438
Get it?

726
00:51:11,334 --> 00:51:12,244
Come on.

727
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:13,380
Start.

728
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:16,308
Take that you fatso.

729
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:19,286
And that... and that...
Sorry... sorry..

730
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:23,218
- Sorry... sorry..
- Brother..

731
00:51:23,346 --> 00:51:25,587
- Sister...
- Wait.

732
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,800
Girls should know how
to give a fitting reply.

733
00:51:36,326 --> 00:51:38,067
Girl should know how to react.

734
00:51:39,563 --> 00:51:43,238
Girls shouldn't grow their
nails only to paint them.

735
00:51:43,667 --> 00:51:46,079
They should scratch
the face of their attacker.

736
00:51:46,169 --> 00:51:48,479
And then watch how he bleeds.

737
00:51:48,538 --> 00:51:49,744
Like a rat.

738
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:55,816
Girl shouldn't grow their
nails only to paint them.

739
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:58,083
If anybody troubles
you scratch their faces..

740
00:51:58,148 --> 00:51:59,718
And see what color comes out.

741
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:01,592
He'll look like a rat.

742
00:52:08,258 --> 00:52:10,295
Take a photo.

743
00:52:15,265 --> 00:52:16,107
Fish?

744
00:52:29,379 --> 00:52:30,414
You broke it?

745
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,356
Happy?

746
00:52:45,295 --> 00:52:47,571
Raftaar wait. I am also coming.

747
00:52:49,699 --> 00:52:51,701
This is also in English.

748
00:52:52,068 --> 00:52:53,069
Amaging-

749
00:53:01,978 --> 00:53:03,753
I won't drink after this.
I am done.

750
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:06,187
Uncle, are you blind?

751
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:27,446
Boss, that's her.

752
00:53:52,662 --> 00:53:54,335
Where's that Sardar?
Where is Sardar?

753
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:56,434
We're asking. Hey, I'm asking.

754
00:53:56,499 --> 00:53:58,570
Are you playing games?
Playing with me?

755
00:53:58,635 --> 00:54:00,273
Hey smarty,
are you acting too smart?

756
00:54:00,337 --> 00:54:02,681
Hey smarty,
you're getting to fat?

757
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:05,379
Enough is enough,
stop troubling me..

758
00:54:05,442 --> 00:54:06,512
And tell me where's that Singh.

759
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:09,352
Or you don't know
what I can do with you.

760
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:11,551
Enough is enough,
tell me where he is..

761
00:54:11,615 --> 00:54:12,525
Don't do powder of my brain.

762
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:14,342
Or else you don't
know what I'll do with you.

763
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:18,030
You Okay?

764
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:28,766
"Hey double bonus"

765
00:54:29,399 --> 00:54:32,312
he likes making women realize
their strength, doesn't he?

766
00:54:32,736 --> 00:54:34,010
Show me your strength.

767
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:35,315
Show me.

768
00:54:46,516 --> 00:54:48,325
Boss, at the back.

769
00:54:49,352 --> 00:54:50,763
You?

770
00:55:12,509 --> 00:55:14,147
Are you crazy?

771
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:50,158
No need to be scared of Raftaar?

772
00:55:50,213 --> 00:55:51,749
She's the real Rambo?

773
00:56:11,334 --> 00:56:12,642
Who?

774
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:18,250
What?

775
00:56:28,251 --> 00:56:29,321
What is it?

776
00:56:34,324 --> 00:56:35,462
Coming.

777
00:56:42,432 --> 00:56:43,672
"My heart goes..."

778
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:50,710
"My heart goes..."

779
00:57:08,992 --> 00:57:10,972
Out in the open.
She's got some really bad ideas.

780
00:57:26,075 --> 00:57:27,520
Coconut, for strength.

781
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:35,988
Come close.

782
00:58:37,413 --> 00:58:38,983
Come. Come.

783
00:58:49,158 --> 00:58:50,262
Stop this nonsense.

784
00:58:50,326 --> 00:58:51,737
Let me sleep in peace.

785
00:58:51,995 --> 00:58:53,099
Don't you want to go out?

786
00:58:53,162 --> 00:58:54,163
We've been waiting for so long.

787
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:56,369
I'm not in the mood, nor is Sara.

788
00:58:56,566 --> 00:59:00,309
Hey... what's wrong with you?
It's a pulled muscle.

789
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:02,274
Shut up!

790
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:06,676
Now I don't need to be scared of you,
Sara's with me. - Imli's got really bold.

791
00:59:07,143 --> 00:59:08,087
Raftaar!

792
00:59:08,978 --> 00:59:09,649
Yes, sir.

793
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:11,248
Do you know what you did?

794
00:59:11,314 --> 00:59:13,590
You hit Boxer's men.
Are you an idiot?

795
00:59:16,586 --> 00:59:18,065
You know the consequence?

796
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:20,700
Then why?

797
00:59:21,991 --> 00:59:24,699
Leave it to me...
and never repeat it again!

798
00:59:27,463 --> 00:59:28,168
Go.

799
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:31,476
Go!

800
00:59:42,011 --> 00:59:45,013
He makes mistakes...
but also admits them quietly.

801
00:59:45,014 --> 00:59:46,015
Nice boy.

802
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:48,724
I yelled at him for no reason.

803
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:51,759
- Go explain to him.
- Yes.

804
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:55,569
Singh.

805
00:59:58,461 --> 01:00:01,635
Why did you hit Boxer's
men at the restaurant?

806
01:00:01,698 --> 01:00:03,143
You don't know him.

807
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:06,112
If you hit five of his men,
he'll send another 50.

808
01:00:06,169 --> 01:00:08,046
The boss means well.

809
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:09,174
Control yourself.

810
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:19,720
Did I really beat up Boxer's men?

811
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:23,127
I was drunk, don't remember.

812
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:24,662
Let's go.

813
01:00:43,573 --> 01:00:45,177
Someone's knocking on the door.

814
01:00:45,341 --> 01:00:46,342
It's nothing.

815
01:00:48,077 --> 01:00:52,082
Hey.. - It's nothing,
go back to sleep.

816
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:58,694
Heard that.

817
01:00:58,755 --> 01:01:00,632
Don't listen, go back to sleep.

818
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:03,466
Someone might need something and
all you can think about is sleeping.

819
01:01:04,627 --> 01:01:07,335
- I'll take a look.
- Don't go.

820
01:01:07,597 --> 01:01:09,201
Stop, Pompi.

821
01:01:11,034 --> 01:01:12,570
You? What is it?

822
01:01:13,036 --> 01:01:15,038
Take my advice,
go back to sleep.

823
01:01:23,613 --> 01:01:24,683
What?

824
01:01:24,747 --> 01:01:27,489
Its nothing, go to sleep.

825
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:29,027
Jealous, aren't you?

826
01:01:29,052 --> 01:01:31,396
Now I know why you weren't
letting me open the door.

827
01:01:31,454 --> 01:01:34,333
- Friend... no.
- Yes!

828
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:37,035
You're not a friend... betrayer.

829
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:39,040
"My heart goes..." - Pompy.

830
01:01:44,233 --> 01:01:45,337
"My heart goes..."

831
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:49,047
"My heart goes..."

832
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:18,178
I also like cream
in my coconut water.

833
01:02:35,051 --> 01:02:36,655
Pompy, did you get cramps too?

834
01:02:38,654 --> 01:02:41,794
Idiot, couldn't you warn me.
I did.

835
01:02:42,058 --> 01:02:43,765
I said "Go to sleep"...

836
01:02:44,026 --> 01:02:46,370
Couldn't you just tell me?

837
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:48,272
You left before I could.

838
01:02:48,331 --> 01:02:49,366
Come in.

839
01:02:49,565 --> 01:02:51,044
Friend.

840
01:02:52,401 --> 01:02:53,175
Come.

841
01:02:54,804 --> 01:02:56,408
Slowly... careful.

842
01:02:58,541 --> 01:03:00,543
After getting married
you feel ashamed.

843
01:03:03,212 --> 01:03:05,522
Take this...
and get ready for the dance.

844
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:09,290
Otherwise... I will finish
the family you started.

845
01:03:13,589 --> 01:03:15,034
How are you, sweetheart.

846
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:18,162
All the girls are taking a chance.

847
01:03:18,227 --> 01:03:19,706
What did I just say?

848
01:03:20,763 --> 01:03:22,208
Where were you yesterday?

849
01:03:22,265 --> 01:03:23,266
I did a complete background check..

850
01:03:23,332 --> 01:03:25,692
On the girl from Romania
who's staying at Kirpal's place.

851
01:03:26,035 --> 01:03:28,106
Why are you following
girls instead of doing my job?

852
01:03:28,171 --> 01:03:31,118
That girl beat me up yesterday,
I cannot let her go.

853
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:36,350
But you said you
slipped in the bathroom.

854
01:03:36,746 --> 01:03:38,521
You got beaten up by a girl?

855
01:03:41,417 --> 01:03:43,727
Borrow that dancer's
clothes and dance.

856
01:03:43,786 --> 01:03:45,595
Get that Romanian girl.

857
01:04:13,449 --> 01:04:14,587
We went to the first
place looking for that woman..

858
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:15,458
But couldn't find her.

859
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:18,124
Then the second,
then that third, then the fourth...

860
01:04:18,254 --> 01:04:19,995
We searched all over Goa.

861
01:04:20,022 --> 01:04:22,002
What's the big deal
if we couldn't find her?

862
01:04:22,225 --> 01:04:24,262
I haven't eaten
anything since morning.

863
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:27,038
What if she was your mother?

864
01:04:28,297 --> 01:04:30,299
- She's her mother?
- Yes!

865
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:32,175
We came to Goa looking for her.

866
01:04:39,775 --> 01:04:41,254
Let's go.

867
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:47,292
Stop. Stop.

868
01:04:52,488 --> 01:04:53,466
Come out.

869
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:56,362
So you hit my men at the shack.

870
01:04:56,425 --> 01:04:58,029
My boss wants to meet you.

871
01:04:58,060 --> 01:04:59,801
Hey... come here.

872
01:05:00,429 --> 01:05:01,373
Come here.

873
01:05:02,465 --> 01:05:05,446
She can't talk to anyone
without my permission.

874
01:05:05,501 --> 01:05:07,447
She's under my control.

875
01:05:08,104 --> 01:05:11,017
And she can't go anywhere
until I don't allow her.

876
01:05:11,307 --> 01:05:12,285
Sara...

877
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:15,020
Sara!

878
01:05:15,177 --> 01:05:16,554
Sara, don't go with them.

879
01:05:16,612 --> 01:05:19,422
I beat up their men,
now they will beat us.

880
01:05:19,482 --> 01:05:20,460
Explain her.

881
01:05:20,516 --> 01:05:21,221
Imli!

882
01:05:21,284 --> 01:05:23,389
I just forgot something at home.
I'll go get it.

883
01:05:23,452 --> 01:05:25,659
Imli, who is going to explain
those two? Come with me. -Let me go.

884
01:05:25,721 --> 01:05:27,428
- No No.
- Come with me.

885
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:30,369
Let me go.
Imli, don't move so much.

886
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:32,997
I don't know Hindi.
Stop moving.

887
01:05:36,332 --> 01:05:38,107
Let me go.

888
01:05:55,751 --> 01:05:59,597
Forgive me,
I got you two into this.

889
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:03,229
No, it wasn't you..

890
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:05,363
Hey...enough!

891
01:06:06,062 --> 01:06:07,006
Come here.

892
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,573
This is between me
and that girl.

893
01:06:15,504 --> 01:06:16,710
You stay out.

894
01:06:21,243 --> 01:06:23,416
I never completed any job till date.

895
01:06:24,747 --> 01:06:26,749
But I won't quit this one.

896
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:31,023
If you have the guts,
then try to get to the girl?

897
01:06:38,461 --> 01:06:40,168
Move the table, come on.

898
01:06:47,436 --> 01:06:49,780
You fell down even before
we started, very good.

899
01:06:52,141 --> 01:06:53,347
All of you stay back.

900
01:06:54,043 --> 01:06:56,148
If you can survive until
this cigarette burns you..

901
01:06:57,046 --> 01:06:58,286
Then you win.

902
01:07:12,094 --> 01:07:13,539
What's this chorus?

903
01:07:45,161 --> 01:07:48,540
Boss, should I light
another cigarette?

904
01:07:52,001 --> 01:07:53,241
Beat him!

905
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:58,416
If anyone wanders near that girl,
I will kill him.

906
01:08:10,286 --> 01:08:11,196
Sara, don't be scared.

907
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:12,994
Just stay behind me.

908
01:08:13,289 --> 01:08:15,166
I'll deal with these idiots.

909
01:08:47,656 --> 01:08:51,229
Last warning... don't make me mad!

910
01:08:56,999 --> 01:08:58,706
Sara... run.

911
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:25,061
Sara! Sara! Sara! Sara! Sara!

912
01:10:25,554 --> 01:10:29,058
Raftaar... your speech
worked like a miracle.

913
01:10:29,525 --> 01:10:31,766
Last evening... it gave
courage to those two girls.

914
01:10:32,194 --> 01:10:34,231
And now she's turned
into queen Laxmibai.

915
01:10:34,697 --> 01:10:36,370
You're simply amazing.

916
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:38,511
- She's here.
- Come on.

917
01:10:39,034 --> 01:10:40,240
Hello, sister.

918
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:57,754
You Okay?

919
01:11:06,662 --> 01:11:08,266
Brave man.

920
01:11:13,135 --> 01:11:14,478
"I am a Singh."

921
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:16,742
"Bravo Singh.."

922
01:11:17,006 --> 01:11:18,349
"I am a Singh."

923
01:11:20,242 --> 01:11:21,585
"I am a Singh."

924
01:11:33,525 --> 01:11:35,061
Is it hurting pretty bad?

925
01:11:36,128 --> 01:11:38,506
Doesn't hurt that bad,
stop pretending.

926
01:11:39,298 --> 01:11:40,641
That's what she said.

927
01:11:41,433 --> 01:11:44,141
I really appreciate all the
trouble you're going through for me.

928
01:11:44,269 --> 01:11:47,307
If you can't defend yourself in
trouble, then this is bound to happen.

929
01:11:55,547 --> 01:11:56,457
Take care.

930
01:11:59,685 --> 01:12:03,633
Be careful next time. We
cannot keep saving you all the time.

931
01:12:03,689 --> 01:12:05,225
You should know that.

932
01:12:08,527 --> 01:12:10,734
"That girl only said two words"

933
01:12:10,996 --> 01:12:12,669
"whereas your
explanation was lengthier."

934
01:12:12,731 --> 01:12:15,678
Try to understand the
depth of the situation.

935
01:12:21,006 --> 01:12:22,246
What's this?

936
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:27,351
Its Imli's stuff.

937
01:12:27,412 --> 01:12:28,356
Where is she?

938
01:12:34,653 --> 01:12:36,929
Hey... did you throw our stuff out?

939
01:12:36,955 --> 01:12:39,196
From today that's my room.

940
01:12:39,257 --> 01:12:40,235
Why?

941
01:12:40,425 --> 01:12:42,598
- Sara!
- Of course. Of course.

942
01:12:45,397 --> 01:12:46,569
Help!

943
01:12:50,268 --> 01:12:52,179
Stand up.

944
01:12:56,641 --> 01:12:57,483
Come on.

945
01:13:00,045 --> 01:13:03,652
I suggest that you retire now.

946
01:13:04,149 --> 01:13:06,151
Shift to Canada...
buy some mall or something..

947
01:13:07,085 --> 01:13:07,995
Sorry.

948
01:13:08,086 --> 01:13:08,996
Out!

949
01:13:18,096 --> 01:13:20,975
Raftaar, I know you did this.

950
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:23,946
No, I...
But it was the right thing to do.

951
01:13:25,137 --> 01:13:25,945
Come forward!

952
01:13:27,139 --> 01:13:28,413
- Come forward!
- Yes.

953
01:13:30,242 --> 01:13:31,687
Raftaar.

954
01:13:33,912 --> 01:13:35,323
Raftaar.

955
01:13:37,382 --> 01:13:38,952
Raftaar.

956
01:13:41,053 --> 01:13:42,532
Raftaar.

957
01:13:46,224 --> 01:13:47,259
Further.

958
01:13:54,332 --> 01:13:56,642
From today you're my right-hand.

959
01:13:57,636 --> 01:13:59,036
If he's your right-hand, what am I?

960
01:13:59,071 --> 01:14:00,675
Last. Any problem?

961
01:14:01,373 --> 01:14:03,444
No problem,
I just wanted to confirm.

962
01:14:03,708 --> 01:14:05,984
I should know what my position is.

963
01:14:09,581 --> 01:14:11,117
Raftaar.

964
01:14:13,285 --> 01:14:14,662
Raftaar.

965
01:14:16,721 --> 01:14:17,392
Sir.

966
01:14:21,359 --> 01:14:23,430
Should I book a ticket
for you to Canada?

967
01:14:23,562 --> 01:14:24,939
Its holiday season.

968
01:14:25,163 --> 01:14:27,040
Tickets are hard to get.

969
01:14:38,243 --> 01:14:39,654
Tilt down, sir.

970
01:14:43,615 --> 01:14:45,094
Hurry up already.

971
01:14:54,292 --> 01:14:55,202
Hello.

972
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:59,030
I can tell you the whereabouts
of the girl you're looking for.

973
01:15:07,105 --> 01:15:08,379
George!

974
01:15:08,707 --> 01:15:10,186
Sara is in Goa.

975
01:15:10,375 --> 01:15:11,217
Finish her,

976
01:15:19,651 --> 01:15:22,097
I cannot sleep in the new room.

977
01:15:24,556 --> 01:15:25,591
Imli.

978
01:15:26,124 --> 01:15:27,501
Coconut.

979
01:15:27,559 --> 01:15:30,005
- We'll get cramps again.
- Run.

980
01:15:30,362 --> 01:15:34,333
"I strode through your lanes.."

981
01:15:41,273 --> 01:15:42,946
Sorry, sorry... it was a mistake.

982
01:15:43,108 --> 01:15:44,519
Did you find my mother?

983
01:15:45,110 --> 01:15:47,090
It wasn't intentional, I swear.

984
01:15:47,445 --> 01:15:50,358
You don't have to swear,
I trust you.

985
01:15:58,089 --> 01:16:00,194
Buttermilk. Drink.

986
01:16:26,551 --> 01:16:28,997
I can't believe she's
drunk with buttermilk.

987
01:17:17,435 --> 01:17:21,178
"All I want is you baby,
so come and give your love to me."

988
01:17:21,239 --> 01:17:23,014
"This moment feels alright."

989
01:17:23,141 --> 01:17:24,347
"Tonight's the night."

990
01:17:24,409 --> 01:17:28,152
"All I want is you baby,
so come and give your love to me."

991
01:17:28,213 --> 01:17:29,920
"This moment feels alright."

992
01:17:30,115 --> 01:17:31,219
"Tonight's the night."

993
01:17:31,316 --> 01:17:35,162
"Come sweetheart and..."

994
01:17:35,220 --> 01:17:36,927
"This moment feels alright."

995
01:17:37,255 --> 01:17:38,325
"Tonight's the night."

996
01:17:38,390 --> 01:17:45,137
"Come sweetheart and...
let me take you in my arms."

997
01:17:45,330 --> 01:17:52,145
"Come sweetheart and...
let me take you in my arms."

998
01:17:52,203 --> 01:17:59,178
"Come sweetheart and...
let me take you in my arms."

999
01:17:59,244 --> 01:18:06,128
"Come sweetheart and...
let me take you in my arms."

1000
01:18:06,184 --> 01:18:09,961
"All I want is you baby,
so come and give your love to me."

1001
01:18:10,021 --> 01:18:11,955
"This moment feels alright."

1002
01:18:11,956 --> 01:18:13,458
"Tonight's the night."

1003
01:18:13,525 --> 01:18:17,132
"All I want is you baby,
so come and give your love to me."

1004
01:18:17,195 --> 01:18:18,970
"This moment feels alright."

1005
01:18:19,164 --> 01:18:20,472
"Tonight's the night."

1006
01:18:20,532 --> 01:18:23,638
"You're my life,
you're my destiny."

1007
01:18:23,902 --> 01:18:27,213
"I am your Romeo,
and you're my Juliet."

1008
01:18:27,272 --> 01:18:30,617
"How do I convey my love for you?"

1009
01:18:30,875 --> 01:18:34,084
"All I can say is I see God in you."

1010
01:18:34,145 --> 01:18:41,085
"Come sweetheart and...
let me take you in my arms."

1011
01:18:41,186 --> 01:18:48,195
"Come sweetheart and...
let me take you in my arms."

1012
01:18:49,060 --> 01:18:50,471
"Feels alright."

1013
01:18:50,528 --> 01:18:52,166
"Tonight's the night."

1014
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:58,609
"You're the bond that
controls my soaring heart."

1015
01:18:58,670 --> 01:19:02,083
"No one's gonna love
you as much as I do."

1016
01:19:02,140 --> 01:19:05,678
"You're more gorgeous than Juliet,
more precious than diamonds."

1017
01:19:05,944 --> 01:19:09,016
"Those crazy
in love desire only you."

1018
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:16,020
"Come sweetheart and...
let me take you in my arms."

1019
01:19:16,087 --> 01:19:22,971
"Come sweetheart and...
let me take you in my arms."

1020
01:19:23,027 --> 01:19:30,309
"Come sweetheart and...
let me take you in my arms."

1021
01:19:50,121 --> 01:19:53,102
If you want to marry her,
you must learn English.

1022
01:19:53,158 --> 01:19:54,228
In 30 days.

1023
01:19:54,292 --> 01:19:55,532
English in 30 days.

1024
01:19:55,927 --> 01:19:58,567
One tight slap and you'll
learn your lesson in 30 seconds.

1025
01:19:58,630 --> 01:20:00,667
You want me to learn
English at this age?

1026
01:20:01,099 --> 01:20:03,136
What do you want me to be,
the Prime Minister?

1027
01:20:03,201 --> 01:20:04,202
But..

1028
01:20:05,170 --> 01:20:06,478
Stupid idea.

1029
01:20:06,538 --> 01:20:08,415
Hey... it was your idea.

1030
01:20:08,573 --> 01:20:10,484
They sent it so soon?

1031
01:20:13,945 --> 01:20:15,253
My mind's all heated up.

1032
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:16,954
Let's cool it down.

1033
01:20:50,482 --> 01:20:51,552
Pompy!

1034
01:20:53,184 --> 01:20:54,322
Pompy!

1035
01:20:59,991 --> 01:21:00,992
I see.

1036
01:21:01,259 --> 01:21:03,170
'Learn English in 3 days.'

1037
01:21:03,228 --> 01:21:05,105
'Are they on to my game?'

1038
01:21:11,436 --> 01:21:13,040
I may look like a innocent dove...

1039
01:21:13,104 --> 01:21:15,084
but I am really smart.

1040
01:22:13,331 --> 01:22:15,311
Did you get those
Hindi-to-English books?

1041
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:17,676
Not me, it was Pappi's idea.
I see.

1042
01:22:21,539 --> 01:22:23,109
You made a match for everyone.

1043
01:22:23,174 --> 01:22:25,245
How about some miracle
in my life as well?

1044
01:22:35,119 --> 01:22:36,462
What exploded?

1045
01:22:37,522 --> 01:22:38,967
Who exploded?

1046
01:22:41,693 --> 01:22:44,299
I asked for a miracle,
not black magic.

1047
01:22:45,630 --> 01:22:46,404
Who is she?

1048
01:22:47,432 --> 01:22:48,308
<i>Shoot!</i>

1049
01:22:54,138 --> 01:22:55,481
Sara, come.

1050
01:23:06,417 --> 01:23:07,987
We are dead.

1051
01:23:16,127 --> 01:23:17,663
Move away.

1052
01:23:30,541 --> 01:23:31,576
Drive fast.

1053
01:23:31,943 --> 01:23:33,650
If I drive slow, we'll die.

1054
01:23:33,911 --> 01:23:34,946
Stupid girl.

1055
01:23:39,550 --> 01:23:41,120
Move. Move here.

1056
01:23:41,653 --> 01:23:43,189
- What?
- Switch.

1057
01:23:44,555 --> 01:23:45,465
Here.

1058
01:23:50,161 --> 01:23:51,333
Move.

1059
01:23:51,963 --> 01:23:52,941
Let me try.

1060
01:23:52,964 --> 01:23:54,068
What are you doing?

1061
01:25:23,421 --> 01:25:24,331
What?

1062
01:25:26,524 --> 01:25:27,559
Move!

1063
01:25:30,228 --> 01:25:31,468
What are you doing?

1064
01:25:31,529 --> 01:25:32,530
Stop.

1065
01:25:33,264 --> 01:25:34,299
My car.

1066
01:25:50,181 --> 01:25:51,125
Go.

1067
01:25:57,955 --> 01:25:58,933
Sara.

1068
01:25:58,956 --> 01:26:00,264
Sara, give me your hand.

1069
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:10,577
Turn around.

1070
01:27:23,207 --> 01:27:26,450
I am a Singh, I never hit girls.

1071
01:27:52,637 --> 01:27:55,675
And she's a Kaur,
she hits everyone.

1072
01:27:59,277 --> 01:28:00,415
"I am a Singh."

1073
01:28:02,680 --> 01:28:03,920
"I am a Singh."

1074
01:28:11,689 --> 01:28:13,168
Sir, that Boxer will never change.

1075
01:28:13,224 --> 01:28:15,568
He sent his men home to kill us.

1076
01:28:18,262 --> 01:28:21,436
I'll handle things here,
take her someplace safe.

1077
01:28:21,499 --> 01:28:22,876
Sir, can I take her to Punjab.

1078
01:28:22,900 --> 01:28:24,902
- She'll be safe there.
- Yeah.

1079
01:28:25,369 --> 01:28:26,541
It's not safe here.

1080
01:28:27,004 --> 01:28:29,541
Till things get sorted out,
please lie low.

1081
01:28:33,978 --> 01:28:34,922
Take her.

1082
01:28:39,417 --> 01:28:40,555
Kirpal.

1083
01:28:42,019 --> 01:28:43,225
Yeah, Kirpal.

1084
01:28:48,459 --> 01:28:50,598
I want to meet Mark, ASAP!

1085
01:29:04,342 --> 01:29:06,049
Brother's back.

1086
01:29:06,444 --> 01:29:08,424
Brother Raftaar's back!

1087
01:29:08,479 --> 01:29:10,652
Brother Raftaar's back!

1088
01:29:11,515 --> 01:29:15,429
Brother, the village
felt lonely without you.

1089
01:29:22,593 --> 01:29:23,469
Raftaar!

1090
01:29:24,528 --> 01:29:25,632
Raftaar!

1091
01:29:36,073 --> 01:29:39,020
Surprising... Raftaar's brought
such a fair lass with her.

1092
01:29:40,511 --> 01:29:42,548
She's for real.

1093
01:29:43,114 --> 01:29:45,560
She's looking at me.
No, she's looking at me.

1094
01:29:46,550 --> 01:29:48,894
Move aside.

1095
01:29:49,387 --> 01:29:50,331
She's a guest.

1096
01:29:50,388 --> 01:29:51,924
I know she's a guest.

1097
01:29:51,989 --> 01:29:54,060
Not the kind of guest you think.

1098
01:29:54,125 --> 01:29:55,001
No, no...

1099
01:29:55,059 --> 01:29:57,005
You had stopped making sweets.

1100
01:29:57,061 --> 01:29:59,063
My heart's saying we'll
be getting good news today.

1101
01:29:59,130 --> 01:29:59,904
I see...

1102
01:30:00,231 --> 01:30:02,268
See... it's already here.

1103
01:30:05,336 --> 01:30:08,340
Excuse me... I've got 10 tractors.
What say?

1104
01:30:08,406 --> 01:30:12,513
You fool, she's got ten shoes.
Now get back.

1105
01:30:32,963 --> 01:30:34,135
Where did they go?

1106
01:30:36,901 --> 01:30:38,073
Greetings, father.

1107
01:30:40,871 --> 01:30:42,111
Why do you have that grin?

1108
01:30:42,173 --> 01:30:44,881
I missed watching
Raftaar getting scolded.

1109
01:30:44,909 --> 01:30:45,887
This is going to be fun.

1110
01:30:45,910 --> 01:30:48,584
Didn't we gather around
to divide our property?

1111
01:30:48,646 --> 01:30:50,125
It's about time.

1112
01:30:50,181 --> 01:30:51,421
Oh brother...

1113
01:31:04,662 --> 01:31:05,538
Sara.

1114
01:31:13,070 --> 01:31:14,071
Son.

1115
01:31:16,207 --> 01:31:17,049
Father.

1116
01:31:21,612 --> 01:31:23,523
Kuldeep called.

1117
01:31:23,914 --> 01:31:26,690
This girl is our guest,
take good care of her.

1118
01:31:27,151 --> 01:31:29,188
Mom, come quickly.

1119
01:31:30,488 --> 01:31:32,661
Sara... mom.

1120
01:31:34,492 --> 01:31:36,028
Mom... Sara.

1121
01:31:38,696 --> 01:31:39,970
Guest.

1122
01:31:41,932 --> 01:31:44,606
Honestly, she's a guest. Yeah.

1123
01:31:46,470 --> 01:31:47,380
Come.

1124
01:31:49,373 --> 01:31:50,579
Come.

1125
01:31:53,444 --> 01:31:57,950
I am Manpreet. And I'm Preeto.

1126
01:31:58,349 --> 01:31:59,953
And that's my daughter Babli.
Hello.

1127
01:31:59,984 --> 01:32:01,725
And this is my daughter Shikha.
Hello.

1128
01:32:01,952 --> 01:32:03,329
Shake hands.

1129
01:32:04,288 --> 01:32:06,097
Come on everyone, sit down.

1130
01:32:06,690 --> 01:32:08,670
I know she's a guest,
but isn't this a bit too much.

1131
01:32:08,726 --> 01:32:11,366
This is her first visit
home after the wedding.

1132
01:32:11,428 --> 01:32:12,498
She's bound to be treated well.

1133
01:32:12,563 --> 01:32:13,541
Wedding?

1134
01:32:13,597 --> 01:32:15,736
She's Raftaar's wife, isn't she?

1135
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:19,071
What are you doing?
Take some sweet porridge in it.

1136
01:32:19,136 --> 01:32:21,173
Raftaar's bride... huh!

1137
01:32:25,209 --> 01:32:27,450
Oh my... take some water.

1138
01:32:27,511 --> 01:32:29,013
Drink it.

1139
01:32:29,313 --> 01:32:30,917
Drink the water.

1140
01:32:36,020 --> 01:32:37,363
Slowly.

1141
01:32:41,058 --> 01:32:42,935
Everything's fine. Now eat.

1142
01:32:44,161 --> 01:32:45,231
Sit down.

1143
01:33:15,726 --> 01:33:18,366
- So sweet.
- There's the sweet.

1144
01:33:19,964 --> 01:33:22,604
Goodnight, sister-in-law. Sara.

1145
01:33:22,666 --> 01:33:24,543
Yes, sister-in-law.

1146
01:33:26,237 --> 01:33:28,308
Okay, sister-in-law.

1147
01:33:28,372 --> 01:33:30,648
Goodnight, sister-in-law.
Goodnight.

1148
01:33:45,055 --> 01:33:46,932
Naughty boy.

1149
01:33:48,025 --> 01:33:51,973
No matter where you go,
you're always up to your tricks.

1150
01:33:52,296 --> 01:33:57,939
You didn't send her picture.. But
did you tell her about your feelings?

1151
01:33:57,968 --> 01:33:59,675
Mom, I tried,
but couldn't get a chance.

1152
01:33:59,937 --> 01:34:01,939
- Your father is right.
- What?

1153
01:34:01,972 --> 01:34:04,282
You never complete anything.

1154
01:34:04,341 --> 01:34:07,345
Mom, don't start that.
Start what...

1155
01:34:07,478 --> 01:34:09,685
- Mom, no..
- Naughty...

1156
01:34:12,516 --> 01:34:14,462
You brought her home inside.

1157
01:34:14,518 --> 01:34:15,724
Naughty boy.

1158
01:34:21,592 --> 01:34:23,663
No, no... stop... stop.

1159
01:34:30,234 --> 01:34:32,180
Now sleep.

1160
01:34:56,427 --> 01:34:58,964
'My Sweety is here.'
'My Sweety is here.'

1161
01:35:33,063 --> 01:35:34,508
You cured my pain instantly.

1162
01:35:34,932 --> 01:35:35,672
Come, sit.

1163
01:35:38,135 --> 01:35:39,205
Sit, sit.

1164
01:35:41,905 --> 01:35:44,146
So tell me...
are you really a guest.

1165
01:35:44,208 --> 01:35:46,409
Or is there something
cooking between you and my son?

1166
01:35:47,411 --> 01:35:50,915
Sorry, I don't understand.

1167
01:35:51,148 --> 01:35:52,923
How do I explain her?

1168
01:36:03,260 --> 01:36:04,398
Okay.

1169
01:36:09,666 --> 01:36:10,644
Raftaar.

1170
01:36:11,034 --> 01:36:11,944
Huh?

1171
01:36:18,675 --> 01:36:19,653
Me.

1172
01:36:39,630 --> 01:36:43,544
Our relationship has no future.

1173
01:36:44,234 --> 01:36:46,111
I...I don't know.

1174
01:36:50,441 --> 01:36:51,647
Raftaar..

1175
01:36:55,946 --> 01:36:57,186
Thinking.

1176
01:37:06,657 --> 01:37:09,228
My son is very nice.

1177
01:37:09,660 --> 01:37:12,334
"Even if I scold him in
front of the entire village"

1178
01:37:12,963 --> 01:37:14,965
he never back answers.

1179
01:37:15,566 --> 01:37:18,479
He isn't scared of me,
just respects me.

1180
01:37:19,470 --> 01:37:21,950
He loves his mother.

1181
01:37:22,606 --> 01:37:27,385
And a son that loves his mother...
has a beautiful heart.

1182
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:31,585
You don't understand, do you?

1183
01:37:31,648 --> 01:37:33,252
You will one day.

1184
01:37:33,317 --> 01:37:34,523
Grandfather.

1185
01:37:35,118 --> 01:37:37,098
- Did you heat the water?
- Yes.

1186
01:37:37,154 --> 01:37:38,565
But let her bathe first.

1187
01:37:38,622 --> 01:37:42,593
Sara, go take a bath
and then wear this.

1188
01:37:46,129 --> 01:37:46,937
Okay.

1189
01:37:47,364 --> 01:37:48,434
Thank you.

1190
01:37:50,434 --> 01:37:51,572
Finish drinking your water.

1191
01:38:05,682 --> 01:38:07,491
Come, brother.

1192
01:38:08,285 --> 01:38:10,060
You can drive
that when you grow up.

1193
01:38:10,120 --> 01:38:10,962
Go.

1194
01:38:11,421 --> 01:38:13,958
Where are you going?

1195
01:38:14,958 --> 01:38:16,335
Did you come here
to wander alone..

1196
01:38:16,393 --> 01:38:17,929
Or take Sara around.

1197
01:38:18,061 --> 01:38:19,301
Take her along.

1198
01:38:20,497 --> 01:38:21,976
Babli, come here.

1199
01:38:22,132 --> 01:38:23,270
Quickly..

1200
01:38:23,333 --> 01:38:26,007
Look, you need to...

1201
01:38:28,372 --> 01:38:29,812
You don't need to
take sister around.

1202
01:38:29,873 --> 01:38:31,181
Because I will take
her sight-seeing.

1203
01:38:31,241 --> 01:38:32,549
You just concentrate
on your studies.

1204
01:38:32,609 --> 01:38:33,644
Go and study.

1205
01:38:46,557 --> 01:38:47,934
Naughty boy.

1206
01:38:57,467 --> 01:39:02,467
"Sweetheart,
your beauty's like the rainbow."

1207
01:39:10,314 --> 01:39:15,314
"Even the moon... looks useless
when compared to you."

1208
01:39:36,340 --> 01:39:37,876
"Come, honey."

1209
01:39:37,908 --> 01:39:39,615
"Let's watch a film, honey."

1210
01:39:39,876 --> 01:39:41,651
"From 9 to 12, honey."

1211
01:39:52,022 --> 01:39:53,330
"Come, honey."

1212
01:39:53,390 --> 01:39:55,267
"Let's watch a film, honey."

1213
01:39:55,425 --> 01:39:57,302
"From 9 to 12, honey."

1214
01:40:00,330 --> 01:40:01,934
"When it'll be dark night."

1215
01:40:02,032 --> 01:40:03,943
"My heart... will beat gallantly."

1216
01:40:04,067 --> 01:40:05,910
<i>"I'll</i> hold you in my arms tight."

1217
01:40:05,936 --> 01:40:07,916
"O beloved, what did you do?"

1218
01:40:07,938 --> 01:40:11,476
"Come in my arms,
let me kiss you."

1219
01:40:11,541 --> 01:40:12,918
"Come, honey."

1220
01:40:13,176 --> 01:40:15,019
"Let's watch a film, honey."

1221
01:40:15,078 --> 01:40:16,921
"From 9 to 12, honey."

1222
01:40:46,643 --> 01:40:50,386
"I want to climb the
mountain and yell out loud..."

1223
01:40:50,447 --> 01:40:54,224
"...I want to make you
a Punjabi daughter-in-law."

1224
01:40:54,384 --> 01:40:58,230
"Sweetheart, let me take
you across the seven seas."

1225
01:40:58,288 --> 01:41:01,929
"After which we'll
land in my village."

1226
01:41:02,159 --> 01:41:06,301
"My father will shed tears,
and my mom will dance."

1227
01:41:06,396 --> 01:41:08,034
"Come, honey."

1228
01:41:09,499 --> 01:41:11,376
"Let's watch a film, honey."

1229
01:41:14,037 --> 01:41:15,311
"Come, honey."

1230
01:41:15,372 --> 01:41:17,409
"Let's watch a film, honey."

1231
01:41:17,474 --> 01:41:19,283
"From 9 to 12, honey."

1232
01:41:47,504 --> 01:41:51,350
"My heart doesn't
beat fast or slow."

1233
01:41:51,408 --> 01:41:54,981
"Every time I look at you,
it yells hip-hip-hurray."

1234
01:41:55,045 --> 01:41:58,618
"Let's stick together like magnet."

1235
01:41:58,949 --> 01:42:02,624
"Let's hold each other
tight until our desires awaken."

1236
01:42:02,686 --> 01:42:06,964
"It's not difficult
to do the Punjabi Bhangra."

1237
01:42:06,990 --> 01:42:08,196
"Come, honey."

1238
01:42:08,258 --> 01:42:10,101
"Let's watch a film, honey."

1239
01:42:10,227 --> 01:42:12,104
"From 9 to 12, honey."

1240
01:42:26,409 --> 01:42:29,686
Raftaar sir,
we've found Sara's mom.

1241
01:42:29,913 --> 01:42:31,085
She's right here in Goa.

1242
01:42:31,148 --> 01:42:32,957
Bring Sara back immediately.

1243
01:42:33,016 --> 01:42:34,154
Okay. Fine, fine...

1244
01:42:34,217 --> 01:42:35,093
Okay.

1245
01:42:35,919 --> 01:42:36,522
Sara!

1246
01:42:37,420 --> 01:42:38,160
Sara!

1247
01:42:41,358 --> 01:42:44,066
Sara... mom...

1248
01:42:45,695 --> 01:42:46,935
Goa!

1249
01:42:52,536 --> 01:42:54,038
You found her.

1250
01:43:05,448 --> 01:43:06,483
Thank you.

1251
01:44:06,977 --> 01:44:09,116
Sara, is that you?

1252
01:44:38,942 --> 01:44:41,115
- Caught you.
- Mom.

1253
01:44:41,945 --> 01:44:44,687
I caught my cat.

1254
01:44:45,315 --> 01:44:48,956
What did you do at school?
I studied.

1255
01:44:49,052 --> 01:44:50,292
Didn't you do any mischief?

1256
01:44:50,353 --> 01:44:54,597
I did a lot of mischief.
I see. How?

1257
01:44:54,658 --> 01:44:57,036
Like this. Like this.

1258
01:44:57,093 --> 01:45:00,336
Hug me...
the Sara hug... tight hug.

1259
01:45:00,563 --> 01:45:04,204
Mom, someone's here
to buy a plant. - I see.

1260
01:45:50,947 --> 01:45:52,324
Thanks for everything.

1261
01:45:53,450 --> 01:45:55,225
She's thanking you.

1262
01:45:56,920 --> 01:45:58,957
When will you be back?

1263
01:45:59,956 --> 01:46:01,026
Never.

1264
01:46:17,207 --> 01:46:19,414
She's leaving, say it.

1265
01:46:20,310 --> 01:46:21,516
Say it.

1266
01:46:24,547 --> 01:46:25,890
Go on.

1267
01:46:28,084 --> 01:46:28,994
Wait, sir.

1268
01:46:29,052 --> 01:46:30,053
- Wait.
- Sara.

1269
01:46:32,088 --> 01:46:34,090
Sir, please wait. Passport.
One minute.

1270
01:46:34,157 --> 01:46:38,469
Sara, I want to tell you something.

1271
01:46:38,528 --> 01:46:40,906
Sara, he just wants to say that.

1272
01:46:41,931 --> 01:46:43,274
You explained her a lot.

1273
01:46:43,466 --> 01:46:44,376
Not now...

1274
01:46:45,402 --> 01:46:46,608
let me.

1275
01:46:49,239 --> 01:46:52,277
Sara, I don't know why you
suddenly had a change of heart..

1276
01:46:52,409 --> 01:46:53,911
And why you're leaving.

1277
01:46:54,577 --> 01:47:00,050
But the way I feel about you, I swear
I never felt like this for anyone.

1278
01:47:00,283 --> 01:47:01,284
Sir, please stay back.

1279
01:47:01,351 --> 01:47:02,386
Let others pass through.

1280
01:47:02,452 --> 01:47:03,658
There's a long queue.

1281
01:47:04,521 --> 01:47:05,659
Move back.

1282
01:47:06,523 --> 01:47:07,501
One minute,

1283
01:47:07,957 --> 01:47:09,061
Sara...

1284
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:12,166
Sir, please...

1285
01:47:12,395 --> 01:47:14,102
Please... ma'am please come.

1286
01:47:16,599 --> 01:47:18,101
Sir please.

1287
01:47:28,445 --> 01:47:31,085
Why was she so upset
after meeting her mother?

1288
01:47:45,195 --> 01:47:46,173
Sara.

1289
01:47:47,897 --> 01:47:49,001
Hi.

1290
01:47:51,434 --> 01:47:52,412
Mark.

1291
01:47:54,204 --> 01:47:56,241
You can do business
in any way you want.

1292
01:47:56,306 --> 01:47:58,445
I am prepared
to give you anything.

1293
01:47:58,575 --> 01:48:00,248
But not Sara.

1294
01:48:01,911 --> 01:48:03,948
I can't tolerate insult.

1295
01:48:04,013 --> 01:48:06,960
I didn't spare my own father
how can I spare your daughter?

1296
01:48:07,617 --> 01:48:09,460
But I will spare Sara now.

1297
01:48:09,519 --> 01:48:12,432
You spare her for me...
get us married.

1298
01:48:12,555 --> 01:48:13,556
Mark!

1299
01:48:13,623 --> 01:48:16,194
Don't even dare!

1300
01:48:22,966 --> 01:48:26,106
You have 48 hours to
say 'yes' for our marriage.

1301
01:48:28,071 --> 01:48:30,574
I'm letting you live so that
you can explain your daughter.

1302
01:48:57,333 --> 01:48:59,210
How are you?

1303
01:49:16,386 --> 01:49:19,924
Ma'am.
Somebody's here to meet you.

1304
01:49:40,577 --> 01:49:42,284
Sara!

1305
01:49:50,186 --> 01:49:51,130
Mom.

1306
01:49:52,222 --> 01:49:53,326
Sara.

1307
01:49:54,157 --> 01:49:56,433
My baby...

1308
01:49:59,896 --> 01:50:01,933
My sweety...

1309
01:50:02,532 --> 01:50:05,274
I love you I missed you so much.

1310
01:50:07,403 --> 01:50:08,575
Mom!

1311
01:50:14,210 --> 01:50:15,951
I've missed you mom.

1312
01:50:16,012 --> 01:50:17,923
I missed you baby.

1313
01:50:25,788 --> 01:50:27,199
I am sorry.

1314
01:50:27,523 --> 01:50:29,560
I was unfair to you.

1315
01:50:30,126 --> 01:50:34,268
My work drove me away
from you and our daughter.

1316
01:50:34,897 --> 01:50:37,173
I was still had the
wrong opinion about you..

1317
01:50:37,400 --> 01:50:39,539
That you got married again.

1318
01:50:40,470 --> 01:50:44,543
No, to forget my pain
of separating from Sara..

1319
01:50:45,174 --> 01:50:47,620
I associated myself
with a orphanage.

1320
01:50:48,011 --> 01:50:49,285
But now I am so happy.

1321
01:50:49,512 --> 01:50:51,355
Now we're all together again.

1322
01:51:01,424 --> 01:51:02,368
Hello.

1323
01:51:13,903 --> 01:51:15,211
What happened, sir?

1324
01:51:16,506 --> 01:51:18,577
Sara said yes for the marriage.

1325
01:51:19,042 --> 01:51:20,180
Isn't that good.

1326
01:51:20,243 --> 01:51:21,654
Where's the drama?

1327
01:51:22,145 --> 01:51:23,954
Easy is boring man.

1328
01:51:24,047 --> 01:51:25,685
You're too good, sir.

1329
01:51:29,018 --> 01:51:30,258
I like this troupe.

1330
01:51:30,320 --> 01:51:31,628
Invite them for my wedding.

1331
01:51:41,064 --> 01:51:42,475
Have you gone mad?

1332
01:51:43,199 --> 01:51:45,145
Please don't make this mistake.

1333
01:51:45,935 --> 01:51:51,715
Sara, I left your father because
he chose the wrong path in life.

1334
01:51:53,676 --> 01:51:55,212
You'll ruin your life, dear.

1335
01:51:56,245 --> 01:51:57,986
I never had a life...

1336
01:51:59,949 --> 01:52:03,396
That's why I never feared losing it.

1337
01:52:05,455 --> 01:52:07,162
But now I do.

1338
01:52:09,092 --> 01:52:11,572
You have no idea...
how much I missed you both..

1339
01:52:12,095 --> 01:52:13,631
All my childhood.

1340
01:52:16,399 --> 01:52:18,345
I've made up my mind.

1341
01:52:51,267 --> 01:52:52,371
God bless you.

1342
01:52:54,103 --> 01:52:55,173
Why are you crying?

1343
01:52:55,238 --> 01:52:57,115
Your father will be fine.

1344
01:52:58,074 --> 01:53:01,146
I can't thank you enough
for everything you did for me.

1345
01:53:03,045 --> 01:53:04,956
You cared for me.

1346
01:53:05,715 --> 01:53:07,991
Risked your life to save me.

1347
01:53:08,317 --> 01:53:10,058
Took me to Punjab.

1348
01:53:10,486 --> 01:53:12,989
Showed me the world
of relationships.

1349
01:53:13,089 --> 01:53:14,659
Gave me a new life.

1350
01:53:16,592 --> 01:53:17,969
My mother.

1351
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:32,348
I love you.

1352
01:53:42,518 --> 01:53:44,555
But I can't be with you.

1353
01:53:48,524 --> 01:53:50,936
Because I can't lose my parents.

1354
01:53:55,264 --> 01:53:56,937
I'll miss you.

1355
01:53:58,968 --> 01:54:02,211
I really...

1356
01:54:02,705 --> 01:54:04,343
really love you a lot.

1357
01:54:06,142 --> 01:54:09,146
You don't worry,
you'll be fine.

1358
01:54:10,279 --> 01:54:11,952
I am right here.

1359
01:54:14,617 --> 01:54:16,688
I'll go and tell mom...

1360
01:54:17,453 --> 01:54:18,090
Sara...

1361
01:54:21,090 --> 01:54:23,934
No matter where a girl hails from,
but she does feel shy.

1362
01:54:28,498 --> 01:54:30,205
So she told you?

1363
01:54:31,467 --> 01:54:33,071
Yes, she did.

1364
01:54:34,170 --> 01:54:37,014
She took her time, but...
better late than never.

1365
01:54:39,442 --> 01:54:41,615
I wonder what's going to
happen tomorrow after the wedding.

1366
01:54:41,677 --> 01:54:43,350
The Wedding's tomorrow.

1367
01:54:43,412 --> 01:54:44,618
Wow!

1368
01:54:48,217 --> 01:54:49,389
Mom, didn't I tell you that..

1369
01:54:49,452 --> 01:54:51,295
I'm going to unite
Sara with her mom.

1370
01:54:51,387 --> 01:54:53,367
And so I did.
Everyone's really happy.

1371
01:54:53,422 --> 01:54:55,368
Well, that's good.

1372
01:54:55,424 --> 01:54:57,961
And mom, another piece
of good news. - What?

1373
01:54:58,294 --> 01:55:00,205
Sara finally admitted
that she loves me.

1374
01:55:00,263 --> 01:55:02,174
And even I told her.

1375
01:55:02,698 --> 01:55:05,542
I am really happy-
Raftaar... very happy.

1376
01:55:06,102 --> 01:55:07,410
Bless you two.

1377
01:55:07,470 --> 01:55:09,211
Bless you too, mom.

1378
01:55:32,028 --> 01:55:40,028
"Come sweetheart and...
let me take you in my arms."

1379
01:55:41,203 --> 01:55:49,203
"Come sweetheart and...
let me take you in my arms."

1380
01:55:49,545 --> 01:55:53,687
"You're my life,
you're my destiny."

1381
01:55:53,916 --> 01:55:57,693
"I am your Romeo,
and you're my Juliet."

1382
01:55:58,054 --> 01:56:01,934
"How do I convey my love for you?"

1383
01:56:02,191 --> 01:56:06,401
"All I can say is I see God in you."

1384
01:56:08,164 --> 01:56:16,164
"Come sweetheart and...
let me take you in my arms."

1385
01:56:16,505 --> 01:56:24,505
"Come sweetheart and...
let me take you in my arms."

1386
01:56:41,931 --> 01:56:45,936
"You're the bond that
controls my soaring heart."

1387
01:56:46,135 --> 01:56:50,106
"No one's gonna love
you as much as I do."

1388
01:56:50,339 --> 01:56:54,287
"You're more gorgeous than Juliet,
more precious than diamonds."

1389
01:56:54,443 --> 01:56:59,654
"Those crazy in love desire only you."

1390
01:57:00,416 --> 01:57:08,416
"Come sweetheart and...
let me take you in my arms."

1391
01:57:09,091 --> 01:57:17,091
"Come sweetheart and...
let me take you in my arms."

1392
01:57:35,284 --> 01:57:40,233
"Come sweetheart... come to me.."

1393
01:57:40,356 --> 01:57:44,600
"Come sweetheart... come to me.."

1394
01:57:49,131 --> 01:57:50,109
Uncle...

1395
01:57:50,166 --> 01:57:51,440
Drive faster.

1396
01:57:53,636 --> 01:57:55,582
It's getting late, please.

1397
01:57:56,372 --> 01:57:59,148
"...let me take you in my arms."

1398
01:57:59,208 --> 01:58:07,208
"Come sweetheart and...
let me take you in my arms."

1399
01:58:20,763 --> 01:58:22,504
Dear children of God.

1400
01:58:22,565 --> 01:58:24,408
You've come to this church..

1401
01:58:24,467 --> 01:58:26,504
So that lord may seal your love..

1402
01:58:26,535 --> 01:58:27,536
In the presence of.

1403
01:58:27,603 --> 01:58:30,049
Why so late?
I went to get these.

1404
01:58:30,106 --> 01:58:33,087
What for? - It's necessary.
It's a happy occasion.

1405
01:58:34,110 --> 01:58:36,283
- Isn't that Sara?
- Yes.

1406
01:58:36,912 --> 01:58:38,516
And who's that with her?

1407
01:58:39,115 --> 01:58:40,093
Mark.

1408
01:58:40,282 --> 01:58:41,920
The one she's marrying.

1409
01:58:43,919 --> 01:58:45,023
What's wrong?

1410
01:58:45,554 --> 01:58:48,296
You said Sara told you everything.

1411
01:58:50,292 --> 01:58:53,569
She made a compromise with her life.

1412
01:58:54,663 --> 01:58:56,472
But what will happen to her now?

1413
01:58:57,533 --> 01:58:58,443
Nice girl!

1414
01:59:10,412 --> 01:59:13,450
- Do you Mark...
- Yes, yes I do.

1415
01:59:14,183 --> 01:59:18,359
Do you, Sara Rana... take Mark
as your lawfully wedded husband?

1416
01:59:19,922 --> 01:59:24,530
Do you, Sara Rana... take Mark
as your lawfully wedded husband?

1417
01:59:34,470 --> 01:59:39,510
Do you, Sara Rana... take Mark
as your lawfully wedded husband?

1418
01:59:45,080 --> 01:59:48,994
Do you, Sara Rana... take Mark
as your lawfully wedded husband?

1419
01:59:57,459 --> 01:59:59,939
Triangle. Love triangle.

1420
02:00:08,370 --> 02:00:09,440
I am too good, right?

1421
02:00:10,172 --> 02:00:11,378
Stop.

1422
02:00:14,243 --> 02:00:15,620
What are you doing?

1423
02:00:15,678 --> 02:00:16,918
Leave him.

1424
02:00:19,081 --> 02:00:20,219
Who are you?

1425
02:00:20,950 --> 02:00:21,655
Singh!

1426
02:00:22,518 --> 02:00:23,895
Raftaar Singh.

1427
02:00:24,220 --> 02:00:27,531
Oh... Bond... James Bond!

1428
02:00:28,524 --> 02:00:30,868
Sardar, this isn't Punjab.

1429
02:00:30,893 --> 02:00:32,201
This is my area.

1430
02:00:34,563 --> 02:00:36,042
Mark's area.

1431
02:00:36,098 --> 02:00:40,513
Wherever Singh sets foot,
that becomes his area.

1432
02:00:47,376 --> 02:00:48,446
I like it.

1433
02:00:49,478 --> 02:00:50,650
Drama!

1434
02:00:51,447 --> 02:00:52,983
I like it.

1435
02:00:54,149 --> 02:00:56,095
This simple wedding was no fun,

1436
02:00:56,151 --> 02:00:58,188
Easy is... boring!

1437
02:01:01,657 --> 02:01:04,069
Go on... take my place.

1438
02:01:06,495 --> 02:01:08,338
Show me your strength.

1439
02:01:10,599 --> 02:01:12,044
Show me.

1440
02:01:14,904 --> 02:01:17,942
Not here... outside the Church.

1441
02:01:21,377 --> 02:01:25,223
What's a Sardar's
connection with Jesus?

1442
02:01:25,948 --> 02:01:28,360
<i>Ek Om Kat!</i>

1443
02:01:29,451 --> 02:01:31,658
My Guru taught me.

1444
02:01:32,488 --> 02:01:36,095
Some address Him as Ram,
and some as Lord...

1445
02:01:36,358 --> 02:01:39,202
Some address Him as
Gosai... and some as llahi.

1446
02:01:39,495 --> 02:01:43,068
The Lord might be revered
in different ways and places.

1447
02:01:43,165 --> 02:01:46,271
But the Lord's abode is one.

1448
02:01:48,070 --> 02:01:49,048
Come on.

1449
02:01:49,939 --> 02:01:50,974
Come.

1450
02:03:39,448 --> 02:03:43,089
This pain's nothing compared
to the pain of your wedding.

1451
02:03:50,125 --> 02:03:53,334
Please don't, he'll kill you.

1452
02:03:55,564 --> 02:03:57,271
This is my battle.

1453
02:04:02,404 --> 02:04:05,544
I will make sparrows capable
of fighting hawks.

1454
02:04:06,942 --> 02:04:09,548
Turn jackals into lions...

1455
02:04:11,647 --> 02:04:15,424
And when I alone fight
against a million...

1456
02:04:16,552 --> 02:04:19,499
will I truly be
able to uphold my name.

1457
02:04:29,998 --> 02:04:31,909
I am Singh.

1458
02:04:33,302 --> 02:04:35,304
I am Singh.

1459
02:04:39,341 --> 02:04:41,287
I am Singh.

1460
02:04:48,917 --> 02:04:49,952
Come on, Raftaar.

1461
02:04:50,052 --> 02:04:51,224
I am Singh.

1462
02:04:53,021 --> 02:04:54,591
I am Singh.

1463
02:05:09,972 --> 02:05:11,713
I am Singh.

1464
02:05:13,442 --> 02:05:15,080
I am Singh.

1465
02:05:16,979 --> 02:05:18,458
I am Singh.

1466
02:05:41,603 --> 02:05:44,413
I am Singh.

1467
02:06:27,049 --> 02:06:30,030
Raftaar!

1468
02:06:36,458 --> 02:06:37,528
I like it.

1469
02:06:39,127 --> 02:06:42,165
I underestimated you, Sardar.

1470
02:06:43,498 --> 02:06:45,569
But I must say..

1471
02:06:45,634 --> 02:06:47,671
I really loved your charade.

1472
02:06:49,171 --> 02:06:50,149
You came here all the way
from Punjab for the girl.

1473
02:06:50,205 --> 02:06:51,616
"You don't lack anything"

1474
02:06:52,174 --> 02:06:53,653
except for concentration.

1475
02:06:54,443 --> 02:06:56,514
And I want you to recognize yourself.

1476
02:06:58,513 --> 02:07:00,618
If you delay, you have a lot to lose.

1477
02:07:02,384 --> 02:07:05,297
I hope you won't quit this
job in the middle.

1478
02:07:05,354 --> 02:07:06,958
I hope you won't quit
this job in the middle.

1479
02:07:07,022 --> 02:07:09,525
I hope you won't quit this
job in the middle.

1480
02:07:16,098 --> 02:07:17,600
Raftaar!

1481
02:07:20,502 --> 02:07:22,209
Raftaar!

1482
02:07:28,143 --> 02:07:31,613
Yeah... what is it?

1483
02:07:44,526 --> 02:07:47,063
You are too good Sardar.

1484
02:07:49,431 --> 02:07:51,411
You kicked everyone's arse.

1485
02:07:51,466 --> 02:07:53,946
Right... it's my heart's desire.

1486
02:07:54,036 --> 02:07:55,572
The desire to make you mine.

1487
02:07:55,637 --> 02:07:59,084
I love you.
No, no, no... don't say that.

1488
02:07:59,141 --> 02:08:00,586
I love you, Raftaar.

1489
02:08:00,642 --> 02:08:02,087
I can't live without you.

1490
02:08:02,144 --> 02:08:07,059
Last time you said that,
you tried to marry someone else.

1491
02:08:07,115 --> 02:08:09,686
Tell me what this means?

1492
02:08:09,918 --> 02:08:12,694
Moron... I'll learn your language too.

1493
02:08:12,921 --> 02:08:14,662
I am not too great.

1494
02:08:19,161 --> 02:08:20,640
Yeah, mom.

1495
02:08:21,563 --> 02:08:23,338
Yes, everything's fine out here.

1496
02:08:24,299 --> 02:08:27,246
Romania looks really nice from here.

1497
02:08:28,203 --> 02:08:31,514
Mom, for the sake of God
I'll call you later.

1498
02:08:32,074 --> 02:08:33,382
Yes, I will.

1499
02:08:33,909 --> 02:08:36,287
I'll tell you later.

1500
02:08:41,883 --> 02:08:45,353
Will you just keep talking...
or pull me up?

1501
02:08:45,420 --> 02:08:47,024
I love you, Raftaar.

1502
02:09:04,506 --> 02:09:06,110
Brother is back.

1503
02:09:06,174 --> 02:09:08,313
Brother Raftaar's back!

1504
02:09:08,377 --> 02:09:10,584
Brother Raftaar's back!

1505
02:09:53,388 --> 02:09:54,662
Dance.

1506
02:10:00,095 --> 02:10:01,665
Come on. Dance.

1507
02:10:41,636 --> 02:10:44,207
"They call you
Bling-Bling... Mr. Singh."

1508
02:10:44,272 --> 02:10:46,081
"You know baby, you're the king."

1509
02:10:46,141 --> 02:10:48,121
"Bling-Bling... Mr. Singh."

1510
02:10:49,144 --> 02:10:50,885
"I am Singh... you're Kaur."

1511
02:10:50,912 --> 02:10:52,550
"We're meant for each other."

1512
02:10:52,614 --> 02:10:54,389
"You look so gorgeous."

1513
02:10:54,449 --> 02:10:56,156
"Baby, come into my arms."

1514
02:10:56,218 --> 02:10:57,993
"I am Singh... you're Kaur."

1515
02:10:58,053 --> 02:10:59,623
"We're meant for each other."

1516
02:10:59,888 --> 02:11:01,390
"You look so gorgeous."

1517
02:11:01,456 --> 02:11:03,367
"Baby, come into my arms."

1518
02:11:03,425 --> 02:11:05,063
"I am Singh... you're Kaur."

1519
02:11:05,126 --> 02:11:06,662
"We're meant for each other."

1520
02:11:06,895 --> 02:11:08,431
"You look so gorgeous."

1521
02:11:08,497 --> 02:11:09,601
"Baby..."

1522
02:11:10,365 --> 02:11:13,642
"Baby... S I N G H...
the name's enough, you know it."

1523
02:11:13,902 --> 02:11:14,437
"You that-ish..."

1524
02:11:14,503 --> 02:11:18,007
"K.I. N.G... We're the kings,
with a big heart and bigger courage."

1525
02:11:18,073 --> 02:11:19,609
"I squander B.I.G money."

1526
02:11:19,674 --> 02:11:21,415
"The papers talk only about me."

1527
02:11:21,476 --> 02:11:25,117
"I have many sycophants
like you back home."

1528
02:11:25,180 --> 02:11:26,557
"Come to my home and take a look."

1529
02:11:26,615 --> 02:11:28,526
"I even show hospitality to my enemy."

1530
02:11:28,583 --> 02:11:30,324
"I am quite capable alone.."

1531
02:11:30,385 --> 02:11:32,092
"...I can face a million enemies."

1532
02:11:32,153 --> 02:11:33,655
"My heart's filled with courage."

1533
02:11:33,922 --> 02:11:35,595
"I rule everyone's heart."

1534
02:11:35,657 --> 02:11:37,034
"I am different from you baby."

1535
02:11:37,092 --> 02:11:39,265
"I always wear my crown."

1536
02:11:40,529 --> 02:11:42,304
"I am Singh... you're Kaur."

1537
02:11:42,364 --> 02:11:44,071
"We're meant for each other."

1538
02:11:44,132 --> 02:11:45,975
"You look so gorgeous."

1539
02:11:46,034 --> 02:11:47,536
"Baby, come into my arms."

1540
02:11:47,602 --> 02:11:49,343
"I am Singh... you're Kaur."

1541
02:11:49,404 --> 02:11:51,179
"We're meant for each other."

1542
02:11:51,239 --> 02:11:52,980
"You look so gorgeous."

1543
02:11:53,074 --> 02:11:54,144
"Baby..."

1544
02:11:55,210 --> 02:11:59,056
"I'm the queen
here... everyone knows it."

1545
02:11:59,114 --> 02:12:01,151
"I see..."

1546
02:12:01,716 --> 02:12:05,721
"There's always a
queue of boys behind me."

1547
02:12:05,954 --> 02:12:08,195
"Look...I am here too."

1548
02:12:09,391 --> 02:12:12,998
"I'm the queen
here... everyone knows it."

1549
02:12:13,061 --> 02:12:16,201
"There's always
a queue of boys behind me."

1550
02:12:16,264 --> 02:12:18,972
"I admit... yes I do.."

1551
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:20,570
"That you are my life."

1552
02:12:20,635 --> 02:12:24,014
"I am your fan too... sweetheart."

1553
02:12:24,906 --> 02:12:26,579
"I am Singh... you're Kaur."

1554
02:12:26,641 --> 02:12:28,348
"We're meant for each other."

1555
02:12:28,410 --> 02:12:30,117
"You look so gorgeous."

1556
02:12:30,178 --> 02:12:31,953
"Baby, come into my arms."

1557
02:12:32,047 --> 02:12:33,549
"I am Singh... you're Kaur."

1558
02:12:33,615 --> 02:12:35,356
"We're meant for each other."

1559
02:12:35,417 --> 02:12:37,226
"You look so gorgeous."

1560
02:12:37,285 --> 02:12:38,355
"Baby..."

"I am Singh... you're Kaur."

1566
02:12:58,506 --> 02:13:00,281
"We're meant for each other."

1567
02:13:00,342 --> 02:13:01,946
"You look so gorgeous."

1568
02:13:01,977 --> 02:13:03,217
"Baby..."

1569
02:13:04,312 --> 02:13:08,226
"I'm the queen
here... everyone knows it."

1570
02:13:08,283 --> 02:13:10,229
"I see..."

1571
02:13:10,986 --> 02:13:15,196

"I admit... yes I do.."

1576
02:13:28,003 --> 02:13:29,607
"That you are my life."

1577
02:13:29,671 --> 02:13:32,652
"I am your fan too... sweetheart."
