1
00:01:16,358 --> 00:01:17,416
Vegetables! Vegetables! -Flowers!

2
00:01:24,266 --> 00:01:25,324
Vegetables! Vegetables!

3
00:02:38,573 --> 00:02:39,870
Run! Run!

4
00:03:12,874 --> 00:03:15,104
l had a dream.

5
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,669
l drowned in it.

6
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,375
A dream with open eyes.

7
00:03:20,715 --> 00:03:22,740
l looted stars and starlets
in the dream.

8
00:03:23,218 --> 00:03:25,743
Fill your pockets with it.

9
00:03:26,621 --> 00:03:28,145
Let's run away.

10
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,653
Let's find a new world.

11
00:03:33,428 --> 00:03:35,396
The clouds are dancing.

12
00:03:35,931 --> 00:03:38,126
Dancing to the tune
of lightening.

13
00:03:38,567 --> 00:03:40,831
Dancing with a rhythm.

14
00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:43,467
With anklets on their feet.

15
00:03:43,672 --> 00:03:45,765
These moments shouldn't be lost.

16
00:03:46,908 --> 00:03:51,038
Color the world with new colors.

17
00:03:53,248 --> 00:03:56,877
Color the world with new colors.

18
00:04:03,225 --> 00:04:10,927
Color the world with new colors.

19
00:04:13,969 --> 00:04:15,937
The wind is slow.

20
00:04:17,038 --> 00:04:19,063
With the burden of fragrance.

21
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,233
The wind is slow.

22
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:27,771
The fluttering butterflies.

23
00:04:28,116 --> 00:04:30,448
Carrying the fragrance
of flowers.

24
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:36,785
The rain is melodic.

25
00:04:39,561 --> 00:04:42,860
There is a zing in
the atmosphere.

26
00:04:42,931 --> 00:04:47,732
Let it stay.
Don't meddle with it.

27
00:04:49,804 --> 00:04:56,505
Color the world.
Color the world.

28
00:04:57,178 --> 00:05:05,108
Color the world.
Color the world.

29
00:05:06,321 --> 00:05:08,516
Color the world.
Color the world.

30
00:05:09,491 --> 00:05:13,518
Color the world.
Color the world.

31
00:05:14,929 --> 00:05:20,526
Color the world.
Color the world.

32
00:05:38,553 --> 00:05:39,577
Come.

33
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,555
Come on, Keshto. Come quickly.

34
00:05:50,231 --> 00:05:51,493
Excuse me, my muffler is up there.

35
00:05:52,934 --> 00:05:54,026
Thank you.

36
00:05:56,938 --> 00:06:00,601
Kalyani! Give me my tiffin.

37
00:06:01,443 --> 00:06:02,876
l've a lot of work
at the factory.

38
00:06:02,944 --> 00:06:04,343
l won't be able to come back here.

39
00:06:05,513 --> 00:06:07,481
Listen!
Go with Bohoni in the evening.

40
00:06:07,549 --> 00:06:09,107
l'll be late.
The children will be waiting.

41
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,376
Okay? Okay.

42
00:06:11,186 --> 00:06:12,915
Ball! Ball!

43
00:06:13,822 --> 00:06:17,155
Pass it to me!
Binu, pass it to me!

44
00:06:20,295 --> 00:06:24,959
Pass it! Binu! Pass it!

45
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:26,391
Here!

46
00:06:26,468 --> 00:06:28,060
Binu!

47
00:06:38,947 --> 00:06:41,541
Half my salary is used
for the house rent.

48
00:06:42,984 --> 00:06:44,645
l'd asked him to wait for a month.

49
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,588
Sure, he'll listen to you.
You're..

50
00:06:49,891 --> 00:06:51,688
What about your salary?
Did you get anything?

51
00:06:53,795 --> 00:06:57,287
No. Master said he'll
give it on Monday.

52
00:06:57,732 --> 00:06:59,222
Why on Monday?

53
00:07:00,301 --> 00:07:01,768
He doesn't intend to give it.

54
00:07:02,237 --> 00:07:04,831
As far as possible,
he wants to block our payments.

55
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:19,710
Where were you?

56
00:07:20,655 --> 00:07:22,020
ls this the time to come home?

57
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,325
l'd asked you to come at 6
other'clock. lt's 6:30pm now.

58
00:07:26,161 --> 00:07:29,096
lf you roam around this way,
you won't get food.

59
00:07:30,331 --> 00:07:31,889
l send you to such an
expensive school.

60
00:07:32,467 --> 00:07:34,958
What do you think?
Your parents pluck out money..

61
00:07:35,036 --> 00:07:36,230
..instead of tea leaves?

62
00:07:37,572 --> 00:07:39,130
You don't care for my
hard work at all.

63
00:07:41,075 --> 00:07:42,565
l've told you so many
times to study..

64
00:07:42,644 --> 00:07:43,668
..and become a doctor
or an engineer..

65
00:07:43,745 --> 00:07:45,610
..and get away from
this stricken life.

66
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,649
But you don't want to listen..
-Why are you getting so angry?

67
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:49,976
Why are you standing here?

68
00:07:50,051 --> 00:07:51,848
Pick up a book and start studying.
Come on!

69
00:07:52,287 --> 00:07:55,313
One two three four five six
seven eight nine ten.

70
00:07:56,191 --> 00:07:59,319
Rimzim, from today, you must
eat early and sleep early.

71
00:07:59,894 --> 00:08:02,419
From tomorrow, school is at 8am.
-l hope you remember.

72
00:08:02,497 --> 00:08:04,727
Otherwise, you'll go in
the afternoon as usual..

73
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,924
..and school might have
closed down by then.

74
00:08:14,642 --> 00:08:18,942
l won't give it. You don't write
with a pencil, you eat it.

75
00:08:26,221 --> 00:08:29,054
Khoki! Take this box to the
post office immediately.

76
00:08:29,491 --> 00:08:30,389
Post office?

77
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:33,154
l'll waste half a day going down
and coming back up the hill.

78
00:08:33,228 --> 00:08:35,662
My work.. -Forget that.
This is more important.

79
00:08:36,097 --> 00:08:37,621
The tea specimen must
be sent to Mumbai.

80
00:08:37,832 --> 00:08:39,527
The people in Mumbai will
then send it to America.

81
00:08:39,901 --> 00:08:41,835
This is the address in Mumbai
and here's the money.

82
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:43,899
Register it. Okay? Register it.

83
00:08:43,972 --> 00:08:47,840
Bring back the receipt properly.
Come on, go. -Go immediately. Go.

84
00:08:56,584 --> 00:08:59,417
Where were you? Everybody
took money and went away.

85
00:08:59,721 --> 00:09:00,949
Go to the office quickly.

86
00:09:01,055 --> 00:09:02,522
There? -Yes.

87
00:09:17,338 --> 00:09:20,136
Come. You took really long.

88
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:24,000
Where were you? Have you eaten?

89
00:09:24,546 --> 00:09:26,036
Or will you eat with me?

90
00:09:27,115 --> 00:09:29,049
Give me the money, sir.
l'm in a hurry.

91
00:09:31,553 --> 00:09:33,282
Don't worry about the money.

92
00:09:33,955 --> 00:09:35,286
Alright.
l'll increase your salary.

93
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,080
Rs.100 per day. Are you happy?

94
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:39,256
Where will you go in the heat?

95
00:09:39,861 --> 00:09:41,556
lt's cool here. Take a nap.

96
00:09:44,065 --> 00:09:47,660
Take care of yourself.
Your hands have become dry.

97
00:09:48,436 --> 00:09:50,301
Give me the money, sir.
l'm in a hurry.

98
00:09:50,705 --> 00:09:52,104
You don't understand.

99
00:09:53,374 --> 00:09:58,812
Everybody has a right to a
luxurious life. You too.

100
00:10:01,115 --> 00:10:02,639
Come. -Leave me.

101
00:10:07,989 --> 00:10:10,389
Save me! Save me!

102
00:10:11,492 --> 00:10:15,053
Save me! Save me!

103
00:10:21,069 --> 00:10:29,534
You rogue! -Leave. Leave me.

104
00:10:31,579 --> 00:10:34,514
Kalyani! Kalyani!

105
00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:36,741
Kalyani, what happened?

106
00:10:37,151 --> 00:10:40,177
You rogue!
l'll cut you into pieces.

107
00:10:40,488 --> 00:10:42,683
You won't dare to touch my wife.

108
00:10:42,857 --> 00:10:45,223
l'll shoot you before that.

109
00:10:45,526 --> 00:10:48,495
l can get a gun too.
lt is easily available.

110
00:10:48,563 --> 00:10:49,962
l'll kill you.

111
00:10:50,598 --> 00:10:54,193
Throw him out. He and his
wife should not be seen..

112
00:10:54,268 --> 00:10:56,566
..here from tomorrow.

113
00:10:56,804 --> 00:11:01,264
To hell with your job.
Leave me. Scoundrel!

114
00:11:03,177 --> 00:11:05,771
There is no point. What's the
use going to the police?

115
00:11:06,547 --> 00:11:08,174
Those rogues will say she
was playing a charade.

116
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,147
So, she was thrown out.

117
00:11:10,852 --> 00:11:13,047
How can anybody lie in such a way?

118
00:11:13,388 --> 00:11:14,878
We're married.
We live a respectable life.

119
00:11:14,956 --> 00:11:16,287
Everybody knows it.

120
00:11:16,891 --> 00:11:18,153
They'll say you're her pimp..

121
00:11:18,226 --> 00:11:19,352
..and put you into prison.

122
00:11:20,161 --> 00:11:21,287
lt is easy to say so.

123
00:11:21,396 --> 00:11:22,829
One world is created
by the Almighty..

124
00:11:23,131 --> 00:11:24,223
..and the other, by these

125
00:11:24,298 --> 00:11:25,560
People in uniforms.

126
00:11:26,401 --> 00:11:27,561
And in our police station..

127
00:11:27,635 --> 00:11:29,102
..there are only people
from other cities.

128
00:11:30,772 --> 00:11:32,069
They should be thrown out of here.

129
00:11:33,141 --> 00:11:34,665
Why do you differentiating,
Vishnu?

130
00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:37,074
A man's destiny takes him places.

131
00:11:37,979 --> 00:11:39,879
One is the birth place,
and the other is the work place.

132
00:11:40,214 --> 00:11:42,409
Both are like our parents.
There is no bias.

133
00:11:42,817 --> 00:11:44,944
Our nationality is the same.
-Who says so?

134
00:11:45,019 --> 00:11:47,579
When we go to their cities,
don't they throw us out?

135
00:11:47,989 --> 00:11:49,422
Or do they let us stay
there lovingly?

136
00:11:49,524 --> 00:11:51,355
They're not bothered about having
the same nationality.

137
00:11:51,426 --> 00:11:52,518
Everybody is selfish.

138
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:56,591
Outsiders don't care what
is happening here.

139
00:12:00,168 --> 00:12:02,261
They make money here and send
it to their native place.

140
00:12:03,404 --> 00:12:04,894
We,
too, must think of our own people.

141
00:12:05,373 --> 00:12:07,466
l'll arrange a job for you with
a monthly salary of Rs.5000.

142
00:12:07,575 --> 00:12:09,736
Look, l'm sensible enough
to understand that..

143
00:12:09,811 --> 00:12:11,403
..the job which pays Rs.5000
to a person like me..

144
00:12:11,512 --> 00:12:13,844
..isn't a decent job.
-lt's futile talking to you.

145
00:12:13,915 --> 00:12:15,212
Vishnu!

146
00:12:18,352 --> 00:12:22,880
Bani, l don't think Vishnu is
working in an appropriate place.

147
00:12:33,434 --> 00:12:35,732
Take care.

148
00:12:41,776 --> 00:12:47,772
Brother! Please take some money.

149
00:12:48,883 --> 00:12:50,248
No, thanks.

150
00:12:50,318 --> 00:12:52,411
lt'll be difficult until
you get a new job.

151
00:12:53,187 --> 00:12:54,814
Return it later.

152
00:12:57,692 --> 00:12:59,159
There is a surplus of
money in your house.

153
00:13:00,328 --> 00:13:02,125
l realized it when l saw
cream in the tea.

154
00:13:04,031 --> 00:13:05,589
Bye.

155
00:13:17,245 --> 00:13:18,974
So, what's the news?

156
00:13:22,717 --> 00:13:26,346
The news is that God is busy
dancing in heaven..

157
00:13:26,988 --> 00:13:29,149
..and He's unaware of what is
happening in this world.

158
00:13:29,991 --> 00:13:31,891
A tractor factory was coming up.

159
00:13:32,794 --> 00:13:35,228
But the leaders and
terrorists..everybody is evil.

160
00:13:35,963 --> 00:13:37,157
They closed it down.

161
00:13:38,699 --> 00:13:40,963
Be patient.
Something will come up.

162
00:13:45,306 --> 00:13:46,603
Serve the food.

163
00:13:49,443 --> 00:13:51,741
Whatever was left,
l served it to the children.

164
00:13:52,547 --> 00:13:54,845
l thought you'd bring rice.

165
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,885
l forgot.

166
00:14:01,789 --> 00:14:03,723
l was fuzzy ever since
l left the factory.

167
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,186
Binu! Go to uncle Kurmi's
and bring 2kg of rice.

168
00:14:09,831 --> 00:14:12,095
Father, he asks for money.

169
00:14:13,134 --> 00:14:16,103
Tell him l'll clear all the
dues next week. Certainly.

170
00:14:17,538 --> 00:14:18,402
And listen..

171
00:14:18,472 --> 00:14:21,441
..on your way, give those baskets
to uncle Lakhi Charan.

172
00:14:21,809 --> 00:14:23,367
And bring some vegetables
in return.

173
00:14:30,918 --> 00:14:32,385
Father. -Yes.

174
00:14:32,687 --> 00:14:36,123
My old sandals came apart again.

175
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,748
Please bring new ones.

176
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:40,891
Not today, dear. Next week.

177
00:14:42,597 --> 00:14:44,428
For the time being, l'll get
it stitched by the cobbler.

178
00:14:44,866 --> 00:14:46,094
Binu! -Yes.

179
00:14:46,601 --> 00:14:48,933
Take these along too.
Get them stitched.

180
00:14:51,739 --> 00:14:52,603
Take it.

181
00:14:52,707 --> 00:14:54,971
Then how will l go to
school tomorrow?

182
00:14:55,309 --> 00:14:57,573
He'll bring it back today itself.

183
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,101
Hello, Uncle.
Papa told me to get 2kg rice.

184
00:16:29,403 --> 00:16:31,337
That would be Rs.20. Do you've it?

185
00:16:33,007 --> 00:16:34,634
Father has asked you to
add it in our account.

186
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,399
l've been doing that for
quite a while now.

187
00:16:36,711 --> 00:16:38,303
He's been telling me
since three weeks..

188
00:16:38,913 --> 00:16:40,972
..that he'll get a job
sooner or later.

189
00:16:41,716 --> 00:16:42,978
No luck until now.

190
00:16:43,484 --> 00:16:45,679
lf your father doesn't get a job
for the rest of his life..

191
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,251
..should l provide food
for his family?

192
00:16:50,324 --> 00:16:52,087
He should at least pay
Rs.100 or Rs.200.

193
00:16:52,326 --> 00:16:56,126
Look, until l get some money l
won't give you any food grains.

194
00:16:56,197 --> 00:16:57,255
Understood?

195
00:16:57,365 --> 00:16:59,356
Should l take the garbage, sir?
-Yes, take it away.

196
00:17:23,391 --> 00:17:24,881
You're still standing here?

197
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:27,026
l'm asking you for the last time,
Uncle.

198
00:17:28,562 --> 00:17:30,086
l won't come empty-handed,
henceforth.

199
00:17:31,165 --> 00:17:33,429
And father will get
a job next week.

200
00:17:37,371 --> 00:17:39,896
Vishnu, pack 2kg rice for the kid.

201
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:45,103
Not the 'Basmati' (Superior
quality rice grains), you idiot.

202
00:17:45,346 --> 00:17:46,438
Give him the rationed rice.

203
00:17:46,514 --> 00:17:47,776
lt's kept over there.

204
00:18:18,646 --> 00:18:21,171
Oh, God! What have you done?

205
00:18:21,415 --> 00:18:24,248
My sister's shoes. -Have l robbed
your sister's shoes?

206
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,318
You've spoiled all the vegetables.
Run away from here!

207
00:18:36,197 --> 00:18:37,687
Vishnu!

208
00:18:41,969 --> 00:18:44,028
You're still standing here? -What
else do you want to knock down?

209
00:18:44,105 --> 00:18:46,403
l kept them right here.
l kept them right here.

210
00:18:47,007 --> 00:18:48,338
Go away!

211
00:18:48,843 --> 00:18:51,903
Get going!
Boy, why don't you leave?

212
00:18:52,446 --> 00:18:53,538
You're still standing here?

213
00:18:53,614 --> 00:18:55,172
Vishnu,
take back the grocery from him.

214
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,817
Come back. Come back. He ran away.

215
00:18:58,185 --> 00:18:59,379
Come on. Set the store in order.

216
00:18:59,487 --> 00:19:00,545
Pick these up quickly.

217
00:19:01,522 --> 00:19:03,012
All this and that.
Keep them in place.

218
00:19:44,632 --> 00:19:47,066
Did you get the rice grains?
-Yes, l brought it.

219
00:19:47,701 --> 00:19:49,032
And my shoes?

220
00:19:50,371 --> 00:19:52,168
Brother, my sandals?

221
00:19:56,377 --> 00:19:58,470
Brother, did you bring my sandals?

222
00:19:59,346 --> 00:20:00,438
Yes.

223
00:20:00,814 --> 00:20:04,477
Has the cobbler done his
job properly? -Yes.

224
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,651
l'll go check right away.

225
00:20:10,824 --> 00:20:12,655
Brother, where are my shoes?

226
00:20:14,261 --> 00:20:15,990
They aren't here. -They're not?

227
00:20:17,398 --> 00:20:19,730
Your shoes disappeared
from the shop..

228
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,825
..where l brought the rice from.

229
00:20:22,369 --> 00:20:24,166
l searched for them a lot,
but l couldn't find them.

230
00:20:24,872 --> 00:20:28,740
That means you lost my sandals.
-l'll get them right away.

231
00:20:29,343 --> 00:20:31,072
Don't tell mother. Please.

232
00:20:37,451 --> 00:20:42,821
Pinu! Pinu, where are running
off to? Help me cut the wood!

233
00:20:47,394 --> 00:20:48,861
Pinu!

234
00:21:04,378 --> 00:21:07,370
Pass it to me.
-Pass the ball to me.

235
00:21:08,449 --> 00:21:10,849
What are you doing, Chintu?
-Hi, Pinu.

236
00:21:10,918 --> 00:21:12,180
Hey, Pinu. Stop!

237
00:21:14,521 --> 00:21:17,422
Pinu, let's play.
We've a match with Raka tomorrow.

238
00:21:17,992 --> 00:21:19,892
Not now. l've lots of work.

239
00:21:20,494 --> 00:21:22,689
Papa told me not to play before..

240
00:21:22,796 --> 00:21:24,491
..all the work gets finished.

241
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,326
Stop, Pinu. Stop.

242
00:21:29,136 --> 00:21:30,535
Oh, no.

243
00:21:30,604 --> 00:21:31,901
Pass it to me.

244
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,902
Buy whatever you want for Rs.20.
-Buy whatever you want for Rs.20.

245
00:21:35,976 --> 00:21:39,434
Yes, buy it.
Buy it. Only Rs.20. Only Rs.20.

246
00:22:28,862 --> 00:22:29,954
Who is it?

247
00:22:30,531 --> 00:22:31,896
You devil, you came back?

248
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:33,459
Stop!

249
00:22:33,834 --> 00:22:36,632
Oh, God! Vishnu! Vishnu!

250
00:22:37,471 --> 00:22:42,909
Some listen to a knowledgeable
guru.

251
00:22:58,192 --> 00:22:59,489
Pinaki?

252
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,527
Hello, Priest.

253
00:23:07,468 --> 00:23:08,730
Son, are you going home?

254
00:23:10,404 --> 00:23:12,065
Wait a minute. l'll be right back.

255
00:23:28,489 --> 00:23:29,854
Son, will you do me a favour?

256
00:23:30,324 --> 00:23:31,985
Here. Here's some sugar candy to..

257
00:23:32,092 --> 00:23:33,650
..distribute with the offerings.

258
00:23:34,428 --> 00:23:37,727
Tell your father to make small
pieces of them. Take this.

259
00:23:40,567 --> 00:23:41,932
God bless you.

260
00:23:54,982 --> 00:23:56,347
Why didn't you help your mother?

261
00:23:57,017 --> 00:23:58,780
Why didn't you come back
when she called you?

262
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,851
You're always avoiding work.

263
00:24:03,857 --> 00:24:05,722
Don't you've any responsibilities?

264
00:24:06,026 --> 00:24:07,550
My daughter also helps her mother.

265
00:24:07,895 --> 00:24:10,329
You just know how to eat,
play and sleep. That's it. Right?

266
00:24:11,732 --> 00:24:13,063
You're not a kid anymore.

267
00:24:13,133 --> 00:24:15,567
At your age, l'd have to carry
rocks for making roads.

268
00:24:15,636 --> 00:24:17,126
l've been explaining
to you since long.

269
00:24:17,204 --> 00:24:18,330
Why don't you understand?

270
00:24:18,872 --> 00:24:21,306
Why don't you understand?
Are you a dim-wit? Or a fool?

271
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:22,672
Don't you've any shame?

272
00:24:23,177 --> 00:24:25,236
Why do you scold the
kid all the time?

273
00:24:25,479 --> 00:24:28,505
Son, go freshen up and do
your homework. Go on.

274
00:24:29,149 --> 00:24:30,878
Don't kick it away.

275
00:24:31,084 --> 00:24:32,483
Everyone is out to ruin me.

276
00:25:26,673 --> 00:25:27,833
Will l get tea?

277
00:25:27,908 --> 00:25:28,966
Rimjhim. -Yes, Mother.

278
00:25:29,042 --> 00:25:30,475
Take tea from there and
give it to papa.

279
00:26:05,412 --> 00:26:06,538
There's no sugar in it.

280
00:26:06,813 --> 00:26:08,781
What's this for? Take this.

281
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:12,246
This sugar is for the Lord.
The priest has entrusted it to me.

282
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:15,488
lf we use it,
Lord Shiva will punish us.

283
00:26:16,423 --> 00:26:18,823
Rimjhim. -Yes,
Mother. -Give him this sugar.

284
00:26:19,693 --> 00:26:21,024
Here.

285
00:26:37,844 --> 00:26:39,573
l can't even pay the fees.

286
00:26:39,913 --> 00:26:41,847
Added to that there's ration and
other things to be bought.

287
00:26:41,915 --> 00:26:43,678
l wonder how we'll survive
this month.

288
00:26:44,017 --> 00:26:49,387
'Brother,
how will l go to school tomorrow?'

289
00:26:59,633 --> 00:27:02,193
l'd saved Rs.100 and kept it
under the sari in the box.

290
00:27:02,836 --> 00:27:03,962
Should l use it?

291
00:27:04,771 --> 00:27:05,863
Are you crazy?

292
00:27:06,173 --> 00:27:07,572
Have you lost your mind?

293
00:27:08,108 --> 00:27:10,406
Remember, Rimjhim was unwell
during 'Bihu' festival.

294
00:27:10,644 --> 00:27:11,804
We spent all the money then.

295
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:13,578
How can we still have that money?

296
00:27:13,814 --> 00:27:15,247
You don't know what you're saying.

297
00:27:16,216 --> 00:27:18,946
'Wear my slippers.'

298
00:27:26,259 --> 00:27:28,819
You're hard working.
You're very dedicated.

299
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:32,492
l'm confident you'll
surely get a job.

300
00:27:35,369 --> 00:27:40,033
'Teacher scolds me a lot.
She won't take me in her class.'

301
00:27:51,151 --> 00:27:52,743
To hell with hard work
and dedication.

302
00:27:53,654 --> 00:27:58,182
'Tell her that you've
hurt your leg.'

303
00:28:00,894 --> 00:28:03,795
'l can't wear my shoes.'

304
00:28:10,971 --> 00:28:12,495
l feel like destroying everything.

305
00:28:13,874 --> 00:28:15,205
lt's no use.

306
00:28:15,676 --> 00:28:20,511
Work very hard everyday.
Live for 60 years. And then die.

307
00:28:23,083 --> 00:28:25,176
'l'll punch you in the stomach.'

308
00:28:27,487 --> 00:28:34,416
'You lost my shoes and then
you tell me to lie?'

309
00:28:34,961 --> 00:28:36,485
'Should l tell papa?'

310
00:28:39,232 --> 00:28:40,824
They think l'm a goon.

311
00:28:42,369 --> 00:28:43,734
Nothing happens over here.

312
00:28:43,937 --> 00:28:45,302
One can't even run a factory.

313
00:28:46,073 --> 00:28:47,506
We can't do anything.

314
00:28:48,075 --> 00:28:52,136
'He'll go crazy with anger.'

315
00:28:53,213 --> 00:28:56,842
'He will beat me up.'

316
00:28:59,786 --> 00:29:06,715
'He doesn't have money
to buy me new shoes.'

317
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,690
Maintain some peace in the house.

318
00:29:15,135 --> 00:29:17,126
Enough is happening outside.

319
00:29:23,009 --> 00:29:28,003
'So, what should l do? l've to
go to school in the morning.'

320
00:29:44,631 --> 00:29:49,500
'Wear my shoes.'

321
00:29:50,871 --> 00:29:58,300
'As it's,
l go to school in the afternoon.'

322
00:30:00,313 --> 00:30:11,952
'After school, meet me next
to the gate in the lane.'

323
00:30:14,227 --> 00:30:18,721
'We'll exchange footwear
over there.'

324
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:40,614
Come. Come on.

325
00:30:58,772 --> 00:31:01,935
They're oversized.
l won't wear your shoes.

326
00:31:02,409 --> 00:31:03,671
l'll fix them right away.

327
00:31:23,496 --> 00:31:24,554
Are they all right now?

328
00:31:46,586 --> 00:31:48,884
Ring-a, ring-a roses.

329
00:31:49,055 --> 00:31:51,853
Pocket full of posies.

330
00:32:09,976 --> 00:32:13,742
Kids, tie your shoelaces
firmly before jumping.

331
00:32:21,388 --> 00:32:28,726
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

332
00:32:28,895 --> 00:32:30,487
Yes, that's good. Go back.

333
00:32:31,932 --> 00:32:33,126
Come. You come.

334
00:32:34,634 --> 00:32:35,794
Take it.

335
00:32:37,671 --> 00:32:41,368
1.. -Oh, no.

336
00:32:41,441 --> 00:32:44,274
She fell down.
Oh, my God! How did it happen?

337
00:32:44,344 --> 00:32:44,571
l hope she isn't hurt.

338
00:32:44,644 --> 00:32:48,410
Kids, Sonu fell down because
she was wearing slippers.

339
00:32:48,515 --> 00:32:49,846
She didn't wear her shoes.

340
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:52,009
l've told you several
times that it's..

341
00:32:52,118 --> 00:32:53,745
..important to wear your shoes.

342
00:32:55,255 --> 00:32:59,988
But l'm happy that some
girls have worn shoes.

343
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:01,991
You go back.

344
00:33:02,629 --> 00:33:04,256
Come, Kishta. You come.

345
00:33:04,564 --> 00:33:05,929
Very good.

346
00:33:16,876 --> 00:33:18,844
Yes!

347
00:33:20,213 --> 00:33:21,874
Yes!

348
00:34:28,481 --> 00:34:30,108
Hurry up! Quickly!

349
00:34:37,257 --> 00:34:39,122
Hurry up! You took so long.

350
00:34:39,225 --> 00:34:42,092
No. l came running from school.

351
00:34:43,396 --> 00:34:45,455
Quick.
l'm getting late for school.

352
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:53,531
Ma'am, Manu is here. -Come in.

353
00:35:56,503 --> 00:35:59,199
You come late everyday.
-Ma'am.. Father..

354
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:01,966
Father? What happened today?

355
00:36:02,041 --> 00:36:04,305
Early in the morning,
my father fell into the sludge.

356
00:36:08,815 --> 00:36:12,512
l was coming to school.
He screamed. So l went back.

357
00:36:12,952 --> 00:36:15,113
l picked him up.
He told me to wash his loincloth.

358
00:36:15,421 --> 00:36:16,945
Because he has only one
loincloth with him.

359
00:36:17,023 --> 00:36:18,285
l was washing the loincloth here..

360
00:36:18,358 --> 00:36:19,586
..and he was applying balm there.

361
00:36:20,059 --> 00:36:22,220
He said,
'How will l wear a wet loincloth?'

362
00:36:22,295 --> 00:36:24,593
He told me to iron it.
l didn't have an iron box at home.

363
00:36:24,797 --> 00:36:26,287
l brought the iron box
from my neighbor..

364
00:36:26,366 --> 00:36:28,698
..ironed the loincloth,
sent father to work.

365
00:36:29,002 --> 00:36:30,492
And then l came to school,
madam'am.

366
00:36:31,004 --> 00:36:33,871
So, l got a bit late. -Go and sit.

367
00:36:37,343 --> 00:36:42,679
Come on, let's go. -Hurry up.

368
00:36:43,316 --> 00:36:48,754
Such chaos. Last night the
minister was shot dead. -Yes.

369
00:36:49,689 --> 00:36:51,156
There were several rounds
of firing too.

370
00:36:53,293 --> 00:36:55,261
Last night l'd to go
out for a movie.

371
00:36:55,862 --> 00:36:57,853
Now, the police have closed
down all the movie halls.

372
00:36:58,698 --> 00:37:00,188
l don't know when all
this will end.

373
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:08,803
Brother, you reached school
on time, didn't you?

374
00:37:09,742 --> 00:37:11,266
Were you in time for
the national anthem?

375
00:37:11,644 --> 00:37:13,339
No, l was very late.

376
00:37:13,813 --> 00:37:16,611
You'll have to come a bit early.
-Early?

377
00:37:17,083 --> 00:37:19,347
l came here running.

378
00:37:26,826 --> 00:37:28,384
You didn't tell mother, did you?

379
00:37:29,195 --> 00:37:32,722
l told you l wouldn't tell mother
anything, so l didn't.

380
00:37:32,932 --> 00:37:36,095
ls it?
-But your shoes are so dirty.

381
00:37:36,536 --> 00:37:38,902
l feel embarrassed wearing them.

382
00:37:39,572 --> 00:37:42,200
This is your latest excuse.
-Really.

383
00:37:42,809 --> 00:37:45,107
Everybody's shoes are
so clean in school.

384
00:37:45,445 --> 00:37:47,709
Big deal.
l'll wash them right away.

385
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,849
l'll make them shine like
vanilla ice-cream.

386
00:37:53,319 --> 00:37:55,549
Punni! Where did you keep the
matchbox, you wretched girl?

387
00:37:55,822 --> 00:37:57,585
Ma'am,
you don't understand anything.

388
00:37:58,258 --> 00:38:00,192
She keeps troubling
me all the time.

389
00:38:46,539 --> 00:38:49,906
Binnu, you're dirtying the
well water. Go from here!

390
00:39:14,467 --> 00:39:17,163
lt was a good job.
You know what it was?

391
00:39:17,603 --> 00:39:19,901
Taking care of dogs. l refused.

392
00:39:20,807 --> 00:39:22,172
How would l take care of my kids..

393
00:39:22,275 --> 00:39:23,606
..after taking care of two dogs?

394
00:39:26,546 --> 00:39:28,446
You'll have to go to the
hospital tomorrow.

395
00:39:28,948 --> 00:39:32,475
No..nothing much. lt will be fine.

396
00:39:32,885 --> 00:39:35,547
When times are bad,
nothing works out.

397
00:39:36,823 --> 00:39:38,882
How will l manage in
the coming days?

398
00:39:39,425 --> 00:39:40,619
l don't understand anything.

399
00:39:40,693 --> 00:39:43,321
Forget it, dear.
We'll not starve to death.

400
00:39:43,763 --> 00:39:45,458
Life is more than just starvation.

401
00:39:46,032 --> 00:39:47,260
Don't let it get wet.

402
00:39:48,234 --> 00:39:50,828
l wanted my kids to
succeed in life.

403
00:39:51,404 --> 00:39:53,998
So, l got carried away and got
them admitted in a big school.

404
00:39:56,042 --> 00:39:58,442
Now where will l get fees
for the next six months?

405
00:39:59,345 --> 00:40:01,336
l made a mistake. A grave mistake.

406
00:40:01,414 --> 00:40:02,779
l got them admitted
in a big school.

407
00:40:02,915 --> 00:40:04,815
But a father has to do at least
this much for his kids..

408
00:40:04,917 --> 00:40:05,815
..isn't it?

409
00:40:07,854 --> 00:40:09,014
'l can't sing.'

410
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:12,723
'l can't climb up mountains.'

411
00:40:13,192 --> 00:40:15,820
Brother..Brother..
-'l can't ride a horse.'

412
00:40:18,097 --> 00:40:19,086
'l can't swim.'

413
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,289
'l can't cook.'

414
00:40:22,368 --> 00:40:26,099
Don't worry. Have faith in God.

415
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:28,870
Don't even talk about that deaf,
dumb, and crippled man.

416
00:40:29,909 --> 00:40:32,377
Where's He? Where's He? What
good has He done to us?

417
00:40:33,413 --> 00:40:34,573
That Gogai, idiot..

418
00:40:34,647 --> 00:40:37,980
He's living a lavish life
by making us work hard.

419
00:40:46,225 --> 00:40:48,853
We're loyal.
Concerned about our dignity.

420
00:40:49,328 --> 00:40:50,989
But we'll die of starvation
and poverty.

421
00:40:51,631 --> 00:40:54,464
Praying and performing veneration
is a fool's charade.

422
00:40:55,635 --> 00:40:58,001
God doesn't exist.
Neither here nor in the sky.

423
00:40:59,472 --> 00:41:02,839
God is just a stone idol.
Just a piece of stone.

424
00:41:03,409 --> 00:41:05,343
And a piece of stone doesn't
do good or bad to anyone.

425
00:41:58,831 --> 00:42:04,326
Brother..
Brother.. Brother.. Brother..

426
00:42:06,906 --> 00:42:10,899
What's the matter? -Brother..
lt is raining outside.

427
00:42:12,011 --> 00:42:16,971
The shoes got drenched.
Then how will we go to school?

428
00:44:53,406 --> 00:44:56,466
Mr. Goswami sent you, isn't it?
-Yes, my neighbor.

429
00:44:57,376 --> 00:45:01,836
He told me. We've work here.
But to count wood.

430
00:45:02,648 --> 00:45:04,809
We get different types
of wood here.

431
00:45:05,051 --> 00:45:06,746
And we count them
and give numbers.

432
00:45:07,853 --> 00:45:10,720
Will you be able to do it? -Yes.
Yes.

433
00:45:11,223 --> 00:45:12,781
Why are you nodding your head?

434
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:15,088
Have you done such work before?

435
00:45:15,528 --> 00:45:18,088
Don't worry.
Just give me two days.

436
00:45:18,164 --> 00:45:19,290
l'll learn as l watch
and ask around.

437
00:45:19,365 --> 00:45:20,662
Okay, then start from today.

438
00:45:21,667 --> 00:45:23,658
Moreover,
we don't have many laborers here.

439
00:45:33,879 --> 00:45:35,073
You want new shoes, don't you?

440
00:45:35,548 --> 00:45:36,674
Come on, l'll get for you.

441
00:45:36,749 --> 00:45:39,616
Where will you get
my new shoes from?

442
00:45:41,821 --> 00:45:45,018
l've brought new shoes for you.
-Who gave you money?

443
00:45:46,826 --> 00:45:49,590
l didn't buy the shoes with money.
God gave the shoes to me.

444
00:45:49,995 --> 00:45:53,761
When did you meet God?
-You ask too many questions.

445
00:45:54,266 --> 00:45:55,893
Do you want the shoes or not?

446
00:46:01,841 --> 00:46:04,105
Yes. -lf somebody asks..if
somebody asks..

447
00:46:04,176 --> 00:46:07,270
..who gave these new shoes to you,
tell them that..

448
00:46:07,379 --> 00:46:12,339
..teacher saw my torn shoes
and gave new shoes to me.

449
00:46:12,451 --> 00:46:13,941
Okay? -Yes.

450
00:46:17,923 --> 00:46:21,620
Where is it? Where is it?
-Shut up, father is here.

451
00:46:23,662 --> 00:46:26,028
Kalyani! Kalyani! -What?

452
00:46:26,599 --> 00:46:27,998
l got a job.

453
00:46:29,568 --> 00:46:31,729
Take these sweets. Take this.

454
00:46:33,672 --> 00:46:35,833
But don't have them. We have
to offer some to God first.

455
00:46:36,442 --> 00:46:38,672
You were cursing Him last night.

456
00:46:39,011 --> 00:46:40,876
Now you're praising Him so much.
What's the matter?

457
00:46:42,214 --> 00:46:46,651
l'd lost my mind. An idle mind
is a devil's workshop.

458
00:46:47,686 --> 00:46:51,178
l cursed God. But now it's proved.

459
00:46:52,224 --> 00:46:55,751
You can't see Him,
but He always sees us.

460
00:46:56,328 --> 00:46:57,556
Brother, you're absolutely right.

461
00:46:57,963 --> 00:47:00,830
He favors the good ones and
doesn't spare the bad ones.

462
00:47:01,167 --> 00:47:02,691
He punishes them.

463
00:47:05,871 --> 00:47:08,738
Shoes. -You'll get thrashed now.

464
00:47:09,942 --> 00:47:12,103
Tomorrow..tomorrow morning.

465
00:47:29,795 --> 00:47:33,492
Veeru! You've stolen my devotee's
slippers from the temple!

466
00:47:33,566 --> 00:47:38,060
You're a sinner! l won't spare
you! l'll thrash you!

467
00:47:42,741 --> 00:47:45,107
Where is she?
Where's she? -What happened, dear?

468
00:47:45,511 --> 00:47:47,001
What happened?
-What happened, dear?

469
00:47:48,347 --> 00:47:50,212
He would've had a nightmare.
Make him drink some water..

470
00:47:50,282 --> 00:47:51,840
..and put him to sleep.

471
00:47:53,385 --> 00:47:56,821
Nothing will happen.
Take God's name and go to sleep.

472
00:47:57,556 --> 00:48:02,584
Come on, dear. Sleep. Sleep.

473
00:48:26,852 --> 00:48:28,319
What happened?

474
00:48:56,882 --> 00:48:58,349
Please, don't punish me.

475
00:48:59,251 --> 00:49:00,946
l'll never do anything
wrong again.

476
00:49:55,474 --> 00:49:57,999
Ma'am.. -What is it?

477
00:49:58,410 --> 00:50:01,208
What's the time now?
-You have a lot of time left.

478
00:50:01,613 --> 00:50:03,478
Come on,
finish writing your paper.

479
00:50:36,281 --> 00:50:38,181
You finished it?

480
00:50:40,386 --> 00:50:43,844
Ma'am, shall l go now? -So, are
you in a hurry to go home?

481
00:50:44,823 --> 00:50:46,222
Go.

482
00:52:00,232 --> 00:52:03,429
Hey dear, what's the matter?
Why are you crying?

483
00:52:03,502 --> 00:52:06,062
My shoe fell into the muck.

484
00:52:07,439 --> 00:52:09,669
Don't worry, dear.
l'll get your shoes out.

485
00:52:09,842 --> 00:52:13,039
Where's it? Oh, it's here.
l'll see.

486
00:52:17,549 --> 00:52:19,244
Wait, dear. l'll be right back.

487
00:52:26,024 --> 00:52:29,460
Don't cry, dear. l'll get your
shoes out now. Wait. Don't cry.

488
00:52:40,339 --> 00:52:45,470
Come out! Hey, brother! -What?

489
00:52:45,544 --> 00:52:49,310
Get the shoe!
Get the shoe! Catch hold of it.

490
00:53:10,102 --> 00:53:11,433
Where were you since so long?

491
00:53:12,037 --> 00:53:13,629
Why have you come so late?

492
00:53:14,406 --> 00:53:17,398
l don't want to wear your shoes.
-Why?

493
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:21,802
Why is it wet?
-lt fell into the sludge.

494
00:53:21,914 --> 00:53:24,246
But how will l go to school
wearing these wet shoes?

495
00:53:25,284 --> 00:53:27,081
How did it fall into the sludge?

496
00:53:27,152 --> 00:53:29,313
The shoes are big.
So they keep coming off.

497
00:53:29,388 --> 00:53:32,323
Yes! You make good excuses.

498
00:53:32,591 --> 00:53:35,560
l'd stuffed cloth in the shoes
in front of you, didn't l?

499
00:53:37,496 --> 00:53:39,862
Then too it comes off.
lt is your fault.

500
00:53:40,165 --> 00:53:43,692
You lost my shoes.
Where are my shoes?

501
00:53:44,136 --> 00:53:46,229
Yesterday you said you
brought new shoes.

502
00:53:46,505 --> 00:53:47,836
God gave it to you.

503
00:53:48,106 --> 00:53:51,542
You didn't give the shoes to me.
Moreover you're lying.

504
00:53:51,877 --> 00:53:55,142
Give my shoes to me or
l'll tell mother.

505
00:53:55,814 --> 00:53:58,339
And then mother will tell father.
-That will be good.

506
00:53:58,717 --> 00:54:00,014
You'll get thrashed.

507
00:54:02,387 --> 00:54:03,786
l'm not scared of
getting thrashed.

508
00:54:04,423 --> 00:54:06,015
But father doesn't have money.

509
00:54:06,425 --> 00:54:09,622
How can we buy shoes
before the 1st?

510
00:54:10,429 --> 00:54:12,761
l thought you would've understood
this by now.

511
00:54:15,834 --> 00:54:17,768
Now, tell me.
Will you tell mother?

512
00:54:19,471 --> 00:54:20,836
Tell me.

513
00:54:22,407 --> 00:54:24,272
'Bumm bumm bhole (Hail Lord
Shiva), the snake sways..'

514
00:54:24,343 --> 00:54:26,368
'..and gobbles up whoever lies.'

515
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:29,504

Sorry, madam'am.
The sewer was small.

527
00:55:39,885 --> 00:55:43,321
What is this? The sock is
dry and the shoe is wet?

528
00:55:45,357 --> 00:55:47,257
l hate false stories.

529
00:55:48,427 --> 00:55:51,260

Silly, it's the final match.

534
00:56:59,398 --> 00:57:00,763
What is this commotion here?

535
00:57:01,299 --> 00:57:02,857
Didn't l forbid you to talk?

536
00:57:03,735 --> 00:57:05,965
The students who are laughing
are about to cry.

537
00:57:06,571 --> 00:57:08,539
Because the examination
results are here.

538
00:57:12,077 --> 00:57:15,478
All the students in the class,
except seven, have failed.

539
00:57:18,817 --> 00:57:21,650

about your father today?

547
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:57,452
He sent me to the market to
buy kerosene worth Rs.2.

548
00:57:57,823 --> 00:57:58,812
The shop was closed.

549
00:57:58,890 --> 00:58:02,257
l asked the neighbors.
They said the shop wouldn't open.

550
00:58:02,494 --> 00:58:03,791
lt was the shopkeeper's wedding.

551
00:58:06,765 --> 00:58:09,632
So, l returned home.
My father was on the terrace.

552
00:58:09,801 --> 00:58:12,770
Father came down. He gave me
the address of another shop.

553
00:58:12,838 --> 00:58:14,806
l bought kerosene from there
and gave it to father..

554
00:58:14,906 --> 00:58:16,305
..and then came to school.

555
00:58:16,942 --> 00:58:18,341
So, l'm a little late.

556
00:58:18,443 --> 00:58:20,035

Rimzim! Why don't you stop

567
00:59:14,165 --> 00:59:15,928

He has borrowed money,
so he's avoiding me.

580
01:00:31,876 --> 01:00:33,434
Tell him,
l'll find him at any cost.

608
01:02:28,193 --> 01:02:29,922

Students,
we know that exams are on.

So, please study hard.

625
01:03:10,816 --> 01:03:13,114
And make the right
use of your time.

626
01:03:13,585 --> 01:03:15,485
Many girls have told
me that there are..

627
01:03:15,554 --> 01:03:17,419
..problems in their families..

628
01:03:17,523 --> 01:03:19,491
..because of which they
are unable to study.

629
01:03:20,025 --> 01:03:22,687
l'm going to meet
your parents too.

630
01:03:23,028 --> 01:03:24,461
Come what may,
they must give you..

631
01:03:24,563 --> 01:03:27,623
..a lot of time and the
right atmosphere.

632
01:03:27,699 --> 01:03:30,497
Don't you waste your
time playing..

633
01:03:30,569 --> 01:03:32,867
..and watching cartoons on TV.

634
01:03:35,374 --> 01:03:38,275
Okay, students? All the best
for the rest of your papers.

635
01:03:38,343 --> 01:03:40,504
Now you may go to your
respective classrooms.

636
01:03:41,747 --> 01:03:44,944
The first queue will go first.
Then the second and the third.

637
01:03:45,617 --> 01:03:46,584
One after the other.

638
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:18,477
Hey, Khokiram. -Yes. Yes?

639
01:04:23,655 --> 01:04:25,555
Calculate your wages till today.

640
01:04:25,958 --> 01:04:27,550
You don't have to come
to work from tomorrow.

641
01:04:27,793 --> 01:04:29,192
Why? What's wrong, sir?

642
01:04:29,862 --> 01:04:31,489
l don't need more men now.

643
01:04:33,098 --> 01:04:35,191
Last week you were saying that
you're short of workers.

644
01:04:35,467 --> 01:04:36,593
Now, all of a sudden..

645
01:04:36,668 --> 01:04:39,694
l don't want to say it.
But if you insist, then listen.

646
01:04:40,138 --> 01:04:42,231
l don't want a man who is
involved with the police.

647
01:04:42,608 --> 01:04:44,075
No, sir, there is no police case.

648
01:04:44,376 --> 01:04:46,173
The police had taken me only

01:04:46,245 --> 01:04:47,075
l've not done anything.

650
01:04:47,145 --> 01:04:50,478
People are also saying you have
connections with terrorists.

651
01:04:50,549 --> 01:04:51,072
No! No!

652
01:04:51,149 --> 01:04:54,243
No! l don't want to get involved
with the police and army.

653
01:04:54,853 --> 01:04:57,253
Navin, clear his accounts.

01:04:57,623 --> 01:04:58,487

659
01:05:30,255 --> 01:05:31,415

662
01:07:05,651 --> 01:07:10,213
Mother. -Oh, darling, it's you!

663
01:07:34,946 --> 01:07:36,914
Binaki, come here.

664
01:07:44,156 --> 01:07:45,214
Why are you late today?

665
01:07:45,290 --> 01:07:47,281
Did you fall into the
sewer or the river?

666
01:07:49,194 --> 01:07:52,322
Go home. Come on. Go back home.

667
01:07:55,133 --> 01:08:00,400

Go home and bring your father.

668
01:08:00,706 --> 01:08:02,196
Sorry, madam'am.
He has gone to work.

Sorry, madam'am.
My mother is sick.

l won't listen to such excuses.

674
01:08:17,923 --> 01:08:20,084
We punish bad students this way.

675
01:08:20,826 --> 01:08:23,260
Get out of the school. Get out!

676
01:08:33,038 --> 01:08:34,096

Oh! Okay, wait right here.

Good afternoon, madam'am.

He's a very good student.

He always secures first
rank in class.

682
01:08:58,430 --> 01:08:59,397
He's very quiet.

683
01:09:13,145 --> 01:09:15,443
Binaki, come here.

684
01:09:23,822 --> 01:09:27,223
Miss Mahanta has recommended
you this time.

685
01:09:28,293 --> 01:09:31,194
That's why l'm sparing you.
Go to your classroom.

686
01:09:31,763 --> 01:09:33,993
Sorry, madam'am.
Thank you, madam'am.

687
01:10:05,797 --> 01:10:09,699
Father, be careful.
Walk slowly. -Okay, dear.

688
01:10:11,536 --> 01:10:14,699
The hand-barrow isn't here,
it's on that side.

689
01:10:22,714 --> 01:10:25,410
Dear, take your father to
the market carefully.

690
01:10:25,483 --> 01:10:27,576
Take good care of him.
-She does take care of me.

691
01:10:30,422 --> 01:10:32,754
They don't ask her anything,
isn't it?

692
01:10:33,558 --> 01:10:36,356
Yes. Their condition
is worse than ours.

693
01:11:40,759 --> 01:11:41,623
What happened?

694
01:11:43,295 --> 01:11:45,024
Khokiram, what happened?
Will you tell me something?

695
01:11:49,768 --> 01:11:51,201
l've been defamed.

696
01:11:53,171 --> 01:11:54,604
l've nothing to do with them.

697
01:11:57,275 --> 01:11:58,469
l don't have a single penny.

698
01:11:59,344 --> 01:12:00,606
lt's been over a month.

699
01:12:03,248 --> 01:12:05,910
l wander around asking for work.
Nobody hires me.

700
01:12:06,518 --> 01:12:07,883
Everyone thinks l'm a murderer.

701
01:12:09,621 --> 01:12:11,748
Can l kill anyone?

702
01:12:16,428 --> 01:12:18,293
The police took me
away for a day..

703
01:12:18,363 --> 01:12:19,796
..and everyone thinks
l'm a terror..

704
01:12:23,668 --> 01:12:25,863
l've two kids.

705
01:12:27,238 --> 01:12:28,136
Oh, God!

706
01:12:28,940 --> 01:12:33,001
There is no God. -No,
you shouldn't say such things.

707
01:12:34,012 --> 01:12:36,981
Kids have nothing to eat.
What should l do?

708
01:12:49,227 --> 01:12:50,125
Yes.

709
01:12:50,261 --> 01:12:52,195
Here are my younger brother's
belongings.

710
01:12:52,964 --> 01:12:55,194
He joined the army a
couple of years ago.

711
01:12:56,067 --> 01:12:59,628
l've some tools and this..
Yes, here's a pesticide sprayer.

712
01:13:00,472 --> 01:13:02,702
Was he a gardener? -Yes.

713
01:13:03,308 --> 01:13:07,039
All these tools are rusting.
You can take them if you want.

714
01:13:07,712 --> 01:13:10,237
Won't he need them?

715
01:13:11,082 --> 01:13:13,880
Now he won't.
He has been posted at the border.

716
01:13:14,252 --> 01:13:15,446
l wonder when he'll come back.

717
01:13:16,187 --> 01:13:19,179
Yes, when he was here he'd go
to the city with the tools.

718
01:13:21,292 --> 01:13:23,317
Rich people have houses
with big gardens.

719
01:13:23,928 --> 01:13:26,396
He'd work at four to five
gardens everyday.

720
01:13:26,464 --> 01:13:27,931
He earned handsomely.

721
01:13:28,867 --> 01:13:31,665
l'll also go to the city
early tomorrow morning.

722
01:13:32,737 --> 01:13:35,228
Kid, it's Sunday tomorrow. Your
school would be closed. Right?

723
01:13:35,306 --> 01:13:37,206
Yes. -You come with me as well.

724
01:13:37,675 --> 01:13:39,438
You'll waste your day playing,
anyway.

725
01:13:39,878 --> 01:13:42,244
You'd better come with me. You'll
learn the ways of the world.

726
01:13:42,313 --> 01:13:44,838
Come on. Put everything
in the bag. Come on.

727
01:14:18,149 --> 01:14:19,013
Get down.

728
01:14:20,718 --> 01:14:22,345
Rich people live here.

729
01:14:22,821 --> 01:14:24,311
We should ask for work politely.

730
01:14:25,123 --> 01:14:26,454
l hope there's someone
at the gate.

731
01:14:26,524 --> 01:14:27,752
Otherwise, we'll ring the bell.

732
01:14:28,059 --> 01:14:29,617
They've an intercom here.

733
01:14:30,261 --> 01:14:31,888
When we ring the bell,
they'll ask..

734
01:14:31,963 --> 01:14:33,157
Who is it? What do you want?

735
01:14:33,565 --> 01:14:35,226
l'll say, l'm Khokiram, sir.

736
01:14:35,767 --> 01:14:37,758
They'll ask, Yes, Khokiram.
What do you want?

737
01:14:38,369 --> 01:14:39,768
l'll say, l'm a gardener.

738
01:14:39,838 --> 01:14:41,328
Does your garden need
to be tended to?

739
01:14:41,773 --> 01:14:45,072
They'll say.. You'll not
interrupt while l'm talking. Ok?

740
01:14:45,477 --> 01:14:46,637
They'll say, Yes, come in.

741
01:14:46,711 --> 01:14:48,144
There's work that
needs to be done.

742
01:14:48,746 --> 01:14:49,906
The door will open.

743
01:14:50,582 --> 01:14:51,913
l'll do the mowing..

744
01:14:51,983 --> 01:14:55,180
..spraying of pesticide
or putting fertiliser.

745
01:14:56,054 --> 01:14:57,521
You'll help me. Okay?

746
01:14:58,123 --> 01:15:00,956
You're still too young.
Just do as l tell you.

747
01:15:02,193 --> 01:15:03,057
Understood?

748
01:15:26,084 --> 01:15:26,948
'Who's there?'

749
01:15:27,352 --> 01:15:29,149
Madam.. Sir.. -'What?'

750
01:15:29,921 --> 01:15:30,819
'What do you want?'

751
01:15:30,889 --> 01:15:31,787
Well..

752
01:15:32,157 --> 01:15:33,283
'Must be a civilian.'

753
01:15:34,259 --> 01:15:36,159
Speak.
Speak. -'Speak. Who are you?'

754
01:15:36,427 --> 01:15:37,553
Speak, Father. Speak.

755
01:15:38,029 --> 01:15:39,121
Well, gardener..

756
01:15:39,631 --> 01:15:40,791
'Soldier! -Yes, sir.'

757
01:15:40,899 --> 01:15:42,127
'Bring my rifle.'

758
01:15:42,467 --> 01:15:44,025
Run. Run. Run.

759
01:15:45,303 --> 01:15:46,429
'Hurry up! -Sir.'

760
01:16:20,004 --> 01:16:20,868
Anybody here?

761
01:16:24,742 --> 01:16:25,640
Excuse me!

762
01:16:27,812 --> 01:16:29,302
Father, run! -Run!

763
01:16:32,350 --> 01:16:34,113
Father, run! Run!

764
01:17:20,398 --> 01:17:22,229
'lnsolent! You've come now?'

765
01:17:22,433 --> 01:17:24,526
'Does your cow give milk
in the afternoon?'

766
01:17:24,602 --> 01:17:26,160
No. -'5 other'clock has given
way to 6 other'clock.'

767
01:17:26,237 --> 01:17:27,534
'Six to seven and
seven to twelve.'

768
01:17:27,639 --> 01:17:29,869
No. -'Madam doesn't want you to
deliver the milk. Go away.'

769
01:17:30,241 --> 01:17:33,233
No. The medicine..
-'You fell ill again.'

770
01:17:33,544 --> 01:17:36,707
Gardener.. -'Wait. Wait,
l'll teach you a lesson.'

771
01:17:36,814 --> 01:17:38,441
'First,
you mix water in the milk.'

772
01:17:38,516 --> 01:17:40,074
'And then you come and ruin
my afternoon nap.'

773
01:17:40,151 --> 01:17:41,675
'Come.
Come for your money and see..'

774
01:17:41,753 --> 01:17:43,118
We're not milkmen.
We're gardeners. -'What?'

775
01:17:43,187 --> 01:17:46,623
Trimming the plants,
adding fertiliser..

776
01:17:47,025 --> 01:17:50,256
..spraying pesticide and
cutting the grass.

777
01:17:50,561 --> 01:17:51,823
We do all these things.

778
01:17:51,963 --> 01:17:53,897
'l'm the gardener here.
Will you snatch my livelihood?'

779
01:17:53,965 --> 01:17:55,432
'l'm the gardener here.
Will you snatch my livelihood?'

780
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:56,364
'Go away.'

781
01:17:57,001 --> 01:17:57,990
'Wretches..'

782
01:18:01,706 --> 01:18:05,369
Well done. Whatever l taught you,
you said it very well.

783
01:18:25,263 --> 01:18:30,064
'Hello. What's your name?'

784
01:18:32,070 --> 01:18:33,298
'Hello.'

785
01:18:35,406 --> 01:18:37,033
'Why don't you speak?'

786
01:18:38,176 --> 01:18:41,373
'l can see you on TV in here.
Do you know that?'

787
01:18:43,281 --> 01:18:44,942
'Say something.'

788
01:18:45,783 --> 01:18:47,717
'Come. Come closer.'

789
01:18:49,987 --> 01:18:51,852
'Yes, a little further.
Some more.'

790
01:18:51,923 --> 01:18:56,223
Can you ask your father whether
he needs a gardener?

791
01:18:57,395 --> 01:18:58,953
'Father isn't home.'

792
01:18:59,530 --> 01:19:00,724
Then ask your mother.

793
01:19:01,899 --> 01:19:03,264
'Mother isn't home either.'

794
01:19:03,668 --> 01:19:06,364
Then..
-'lt's just me and my grandma.'

795
01:19:06,938 --> 01:19:08,496
Then ask your grandma. Please.

796
01:19:09,173 --> 01:19:10,936
ls there work to be
done in the garden?

797
01:19:11,576 --> 01:19:13,737
'You're a gardener? So young?'

798
01:19:13,845 --> 01:19:15,107
Not me. My father.

799
01:19:16,581 --> 01:19:18,344
'Where is your father?'

800
01:19:18,649 --> 01:19:19,843
Right here. On the road.

801
01:19:20,284 --> 01:19:22,809
Please,
can you ask your grandma now?

802
01:19:25,723 --> 01:19:28,521
'First, tell me your name.' -Pinu.

803
01:19:30,194 --> 01:19:31,718
'My name is Kumu.'

804
01:19:32,363 --> 01:19:33,853
'Which class do you study in?'

805
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:35,957
Class Vl. Division B.

806
01:19:37,068 --> 01:19:38,330
'What's the name of the school?'

807
01:19:39,370 --> 01:19:41,429
Can you ask your grandma? Please.

808
01:19:42,373 --> 01:19:44,898
'Grandma is praying.'

809
01:19:45,443 --> 01:19:46,740
You should have said that before.

810
01:19:48,346 --> 01:19:52,214
'Wait, Pinu.
Will you come to play with me?'

811
01:19:53,284 --> 01:19:54,649
Pinu, let's go.

812
01:19:54,952 --> 01:19:55,976
l've to go.

813
01:20:05,329 --> 01:20:10,323
Pinu! Pinu, stop! Pinu, stop!

814
01:20:10,435 --> 01:20:11,561
Stop.

815
01:20:28,152 --> 01:20:31,849
We've some fertiliser and tools.
-Okay.

816
01:20:32,290 --> 01:20:34,087
Use them. -Fine.

817
01:20:34,759 --> 01:20:37,751
And you'll have to spray the
pesticide. -All right.

818
01:20:38,429 --> 01:20:41,023
Especially those roses.

819
01:20:42,099 --> 01:20:43,828
l planted them myself.

820
01:20:44,502 --> 01:20:45,469
They're very delicate.

821
01:20:46,070 --> 01:20:48,095
lf you don't spray pesticide
after two to four days..

822
01:20:48,506 --> 01:20:49,734
..the insects eat away at them.

823
01:20:50,074 --> 01:20:51,371
No. l've a spray pump.

824
01:20:51,776 --> 01:20:53,471
Pinu, let's play.

825
01:20:56,547 --> 01:20:57,479
Go on, son.

826
01:21:08,993 --> 01:21:11,223
Your garden is very beautiful.
-Yes.

827
01:21:12,096 --> 01:21:13,154
l'm also proud of it.

828
01:21:14,031 --> 01:21:15,623
lt's a legacy of my ancestors.

829
01:21:16,667 --> 01:21:19,227
lt seems you give special
attention to it.

830
01:21:19,370 --> 01:21:20,359
Yes, l've learnt a lot.

831
01:21:20,771 --> 01:21:21,965
First, mother taught me.

832
01:21:22,306 --> 01:21:25,002
Later on,
father-in-law would teach me.

833
01:21:26,177 --> 01:21:28,236
Nowadays, everyone goes to work.

834
01:21:28,779 --> 01:21:30,212
Nobody has time.

835
01:21:31,182 --> 01:21:34,208
l wonder who will take
care of it after me.

836
01:21:36,020 --> 01:21:38,545
Pinu,
should l show you Cutie and Bumpy?

837
01:21:38,823 --> 01:21:40,313
Who are Cutie and Bumpy?

838
01:21:40,424 --> 01:21:42,790
They're kids. -Kids? Yours?

839
01:21:43,127 --> 01:21:44,185
Yes.

840
01:21:44,695 --> 01:21:46,322
They talk a lot.

841
01:21:47,565 --> 01:21:49,465
Ask anything. They'll answer.

842
01:22:00,511 --> 01:22:01,910
Pinu, you..

843
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:05,215
Pinu, wait here.
l'll be right back.

844
01:22:27,738 --> 01:22:30,673
This is my Cutie and he's Bumpy.

845
01:22:31,242 --> 01:22:33,142
So many sandals and shoes?

846
01:22:33,611 --> 01:22:35,272
Does your father own a showroom?

847
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:38,205
Of course not. They're all mine.

848
01:22:39,550 --> 01:22:41,211
What do you do with all these?

849
01:22:41,652 --> 01:22:45,418
l wear them. These are school
shoes, these are dancing shoes.

850
01:22:45,489 --> 01:22:48,890
l wear these at home.
These are for birthday parties.

851
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:52,862
Pink shoes for pink frock.
Blue shoes for a blue frock.

852
01:23:00,972 --> 01:23:01,961
Thank you, son.

853
01:23:02,039 --> 01:23:02,937
Take this.

854
01:23:03,007 --> 01:23:04,998
Money doesn't mean much.
At least, l've got some work.

855
01:23:05,142 --> 01:23:06,439
That's why keep this.

856
01:23:08,613 --> 01:23:11,446
This is too much.

857
01:23:12,183 --> 01:23:14,549
lt's too less when compared to
your hard work and dedication.

858
01:23:16,921 --> 01:23:17,819
Thank you.

859
01:23:18,055 --> 01:23:20,216
You've done the job for us.

860
01:23:20,758 --> 01:23:22,658
So, we should thank you.

861
01:23:23,227 --> 01:23:24,922
Our gardener disappeared
all of a sudden.

862
01:23:25,596 --> 01:23:26,858
Thank God you showed up.

863
01:23:27,131 --> 01:23:29,759
Otherwise, our roses could
have withered away.

864
01:23:30,201 --> 01:23:32,567
Okay. Thank you very much.

865
01:23:35,906 --> 01:23:36,930
Pinu!

866
01:23:45,016 --> 01:23:46,381
He's really strange.

867
01:23:46,751 --> 01:23:47,718
l mean God.

868
01:23:48,019 --> 01:23:50,453
He takes time,
but He does His work.

869
01:23:51,055 --> 01:23:52,886
You'll see. We'll be well-off now.

870
01:23:53,491 --> 01:23:55,015
Grandma has recommended
four other families.

871
01:23:55,192 --> 01:23:56,989
Those four families would
recommend four other.

872
01:23:57,461 --> 01:24:00,191
Those eight families would
tell their neighbours.

873
01:24:00,898 --> 01:24:03,560
ln a month we'll have 50
gardens to tend to.

874
01:24:03,901 --> 01:24:04,993
We'll earn a lot of money.

875
01:24:06,070 --> 01:24:09,938
Grocer, landlord.. That rogue,
l'll teach him a lesson.

876
01:24:10,975 --> 01:24:13,102
Forget him. We'll buy a new house.

877
01:24:13,944 --> 01:24:18,074
ln the new house, we'll have a
new bed, new fridge, new TV.

878
01:24:18,149 --> 01:24:20,515
But first, new shoes for Rimjhim.

879
01:24:20,985 --> 01:24:22,179
Her shoes are torn badly.

880
01:24:22,586 --> 01:24:26,784
Yes, for both of you.
lf needed, we'll buy a shoe shop.

881
01:24:27,024 --> 01:24:28,116
Happy?

882
01:24:41,972 --> 01:24:43,633
Bumm Bumm. (Hail..)

883
01:24:45,042 --> 01:24:46,441
Bumm Bumm Bhole.
(Hail Lord Shiva.)

884
01:24:47,144 --> 01:24:48,042
Bumm Bumm.

885
01:24:49,146 --> 01:24:50,272
Bumm Bumm Bhole.

886
01:24:58,522 --> 01:25:01,958
Ask what your heart wants.

887
01:25:02,626 --> 01:25:05,857
Ask it from the sky.

888
01:25:06,897 --> 01:25:10,196
Why do you only think
about the stars?

889
01:25:10,935 --> 01:25:14,166
Wish that you'd fly
and take the moon.

890
01:25:15,072 --> 01:25:16,334
What's the harm?

891
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:18,203
Why are you holding
yourself back?

892
01:25:18,442 --> 01:25:22,469
There are joys hidden in every
moment. Steal them.

893
01:25:23,347 --> 01:25:27,408
-Bumm Bumm Bhole.
-Bumm Bumm Bhole.

894
01:25:27,551 --> 01:25:31,681
Bumm Bumm Bhole.
Bumm Bumm Bhole.

895
01:25:31,789 --> 01:25:36,488
Bumm Bumm Bhole.

896
01:25:36,594 --> 01:25:40,030
Bumm Bumm Bhole.

897
01:26:13,130 --> 01:26:16,395
You'll find angels on your way.

898
01:26:17,201 --> 01:26:20,500
You'll find new relationships.

899
01:26:21,372 --> 01:26:24,671
We'll finish the journey
with a smile.

900
01:26:25,442 --> 01:26:28,775
The path will show you
your destination.

901
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:30,947
What's the harm?

902
01:26:31,015 --> 01:26:33,006
Why are you holding
yourself back?

903
01:26:33,083 --> 01:26:37,019
There are joys hidden in every
moment. Steal them.

904
01:26:47,765 --> 01:26:51,633
Bumm Bumm Bhole.

905
01:26:56,073 --> 01:27:00,533
Bumm Bumm Bhole.

906
01:27:03,814 --> 01:27:07,079
Bumm Bumm Bhole.

907
01:27:07,952 --> 01:27:11,149
Bumm Bumm Bhole.

908
01:27:12,056 --> 01:27:15,048
Bumm Bumm Bhole.

909
01:27:15,159 --> 01:27:16,148
Pinu!

910
01:27:17,995 --> 01:27:22,762
Father!
Father, stop! Move! Father!

911
01:27:22,833 --> 01:27:25,427
Hey, move! -Father! -Pinu!

912
01:27:26,370 --> 01:27:27,962
Father, please! -Move!

913
01:27:28,038 --> 01:27:30,063
Father, apply the brake!
Father, stop!

914
01:27:31,242 --> 01:27:33,107
Father, we'll fall!

915
01:27:33,210 --> 01:27:34,268
Hold on!

916
01:27:50,561 --> 01:27:51,459
Sister-in-law..

917
01:27:51,528 --> 01:27:53,792
..l've brought rice pudding
and Pilaf for the kids.

918
01:27:53,898 --> 01:27:54,796
Take it.

919
01:27:56,300 --> 01:27:58,393
l heard even the cycle broke.

920
01:27:59,470 --> 01:28:04,271
Wasn't it rented? -Yes. He's
demanding Rs.900 for his loss.

921
01:28:05,576 --> 01:28:08,511
But we were lucky.
Pinu was unhurt.

922
01:28:09,847 --> 01:28:13,715
l've asked brother to stop
doing these petty jobs.

923
01:28:14,451 --> 01:28:17,477
Find a good job so that he
can support his family.

924
01:28:20,324 --> 01:28:21,723
We've seen worse times.

925
01:28:22,593 --> 01:28:23,855
Sister-in-law, do you remember?

926
01:28:24,028 --> 01:28:26,292
We'd drink a mixture of flour
and water for months on end.

927
01:28:27,164 --> 01:28:29,462
But he got the job of distributing
medicine.

928
01:28:30,234 --> 01:28:31,462
We're well-off now.

929
01:28:32,236 --> 01:28:34,761
Look at this.
We didn't buy it from the fair.

930
01:28:35,306 --> 01:28:36,466
Got it made by the goldsmith.

931
01:28:36,740 --> 01:28:37,604
These days..

932
01:28:37,675 --> 01:28:39,939
..he doesn't even have to move
about in the harsh sun.

933
01:28:40,511 --> 01:28:42,536
He sends medicine sitting at home.

934
01:28:43,414 --> 01:28:44,972
He has hired around eight people.

935
01:28:45,683 --> 01:28:48,618
Kali's son Jayu.
He also works for us.

936
01:28:49,453 --> 01:28:52,684
A 12-year-old boy earns
Rs.100 to Rs.200 a day.

937
01:28:53,090 --> 01:28:53,988
You see.

938
01:28:54,091 --> 01:28:56,559
Aunty, are you wearing new shoes?

939
01:28:57,561 --> 01:29:01,088
He gives work to others. Wouldn't
my husband help his friend?

940
01:29:02,066 --> 01:29:03,590
But brother is too arrogant.

941
01:29:04,568 --> 01:29:06,502
How can he ask his brother-in-law
for a favor?

942
01:29:07,237 --> 01:29:10,502
We asked you when we needed it,
didn't we?

943
01:29:11,375 --> 01:29:12,364
But he won't.

944
01:29:13,110 --> 01:29:15,943
Well, it was my job to inform you.

945
01:29:16,914 --> 01:29:18,006
The rest is up to you.

946
01:29:57,688 --> 01:30:00,054
Uncle, how much for these shoes?

947
01:30:00,624 --> 01:30:01,716
Rs.80.

948
01:30:07,765 --> 01:30:09,357
How many questions will
you ask the kid?

949
01:30:10,367 --> 01:30:12,232
Don't you know the financial
crisis we're going through?

950
01:30:13,003 --> 01:30:15,096
He wants to earn money
and share the burden.

951
01:30:15,506 --> 01:30:16,473
lt's a good idea.

952
01:30:17,207 --> 01:30:20,176
You give jobs to others. Why can't
you give your own people?

953
01:30:20,844 --> 01:30:22,436
The family won't lose
any money to others.

954
01:30:22,980 --> 01:30:25,039
Okay. Okay. l'll do something.

955
01:30:27,251 --> 01:30:28,275
Come here.

956
01:30:32,189 --> 01:30:33,213
What will you do?

957
01:30:33,490 --> 01:30:34,684
Anything you say.

958
01:30:38,796 --> 01:30:40,559
You'll have to meet the people
l tell you to meet.

959
01:30:42,032 --> 01:30:43,226
And do as they say.

960
01:30:43,867 --> 01:30:44,856
lt's a day's job.

961
01:30:45,903 --> 01:30:50,897
You'll earn this much if
you make three trips.

962
01:30:52,176 --> 01:30:56,169
Come on. Let's go in. Come.

963
01:31:00,284 --> 01:31:01,945
Have you seen Suma tailor's shop,
which is across?

964
01:31:04,621 --> 01:31:07,818
Ask him if Mani Ramdas's
long-sleeve shirt is ready?

965
01:31:10,194 --> 01:31:11,889
But where do l've to deliver
the long-sleeve shirt?

966
01:31:12,596 --> 01:31:13,893
How do l know?

967
01:31:15,032 --> 01:31:16,226
Suma will tell you.

968
01:31:17,201 --> 01:31:20,898
Suma will tell you where you have
to go and what you've to do.

969
01:31:21,638 --> 01:31:24,129
But keep your mouth shut.
Completely shut.

970
01:31:27,377 --> 01:31:28,503
Go.

971
01:31:33,917 --> 01:31:34,781
Money.

972
01:31:46,196 --> 01:31:47,094
And that?

973
01:31:48,232 --> 01:31:50,723
You'll get the rest after
the three trips.

974
01:31:52,402 --> 01:31:54,370
lt's torn. -Stick it together.

975
01:31:54,938 --> 01:31:56,963
Everything goes in the poor
regions of a rich country.

976
01:32:09,786 --> 01:32:11,777
Brother Suma.
l want to meet brother Suma.

977
01:32:12,990 --> 01:32:15,083
Why? -ls Mani Ramdas's long-sleeve
shirt ready?

978
01:32:38,048 --> 01:32:38,912
Listen..

979
01:33:31,568 --> 01:33:33,229
Listen, boy. Why are you here?

980
01:33:36,506 --> 01:33:40,408
Suma tailor has sent me with
Maniram's long-sleeve shirt.

981
01:34:35,866 --> 01:34:39,199
Listen there is a bus stop
in the cloth market.

982
01:34:39,369 --> 01:34:40,893
Have you seen it?

983
01:34:41,204 --> 01:34:43,001
Stand there with this tiffin.

984
01:34:43,307 --> 01:34:45,298
Brother Pulkit will come there.
Who?

985
01:34:45,375 --> 01:34:48,242
Brother Pulkit. -Give this to him.

986
01:34:48,645 --> 01:34:50,237
And look, keep your mouth shut.

987
01:34:50,414 --> 01:34:52,905
Just mind your own business.
-Otherwise, l'll get you killed.

988
01:34:52,983 --> 01:34:54,041
You get that?

989
01:36:24,207 --> 01:36:27,108
Uncle.
Uncle. Don't sell these shoes.

990
01:36:27,577 --> 01:36:29,943
l'll be right back with the money.
Don't sell them. Okay.

991
01:36:30,013 --> 01:36:31,071
Okay. -Please.

992
01:37:36,847 --> 01:37:38,644
Who are you guys?
What do you want?

993
01:37:39,149 --> 01:37:40,810
Who are you guys?
What do you want?

994
01:37:57,534 --> 01:37:59,832
Move it. And get the ambulance.

995
01:38:41,678 --> 01:38:44,647
Leave me. Leave me.

996
01:38:45,248 --> 01:38:49,116
Vishnu.
Why did they kill my Vishnu?

997
01:39:22,385 --> 01:39:23,818
Listen, child. Who are you?

998
01:39:25,789 --> 01:39:26,881
What are you doing?

999
01:39:29,326 --> 01:39:32,124
Come on, go home. Go.

1000
01:39:53,316 --> 01:39:56,683
The junior school's marathon
is being held in our area.

1001
01:39:57,487 --> 01:39:59,546
All the schools will
be sending their..

1002
01:39:59,623 --> 01:40:01,352
..fastest sprinters for this race.

1003
01:40:02,792 --> 01:40:04,692
We also have to participate
in this marathon.

1004
01:40:05,829 --> 01:40:09,196
Today l'm going to select the kids
who want to participate..

1005
01:40:09,699 --> 01:40:12,065
..in this marathon during the
fourth period in this ground.

1006
01:40:12,802 --> 01:40:14,667
The five fastest kids will be..

1007
01:40:14,771 --> 01:40:17,672
..sent to the marathon to
represent our school.

1008
01:40:18,441 --> 01:40:22,138
l don't know. l know nothing.

1009
01:40:22,946 --> 01:40:25,813
Who had got it?
Where was the gun hidden?

1010
01:40:25,915 --> 01:40:27,212
l know nothing.

1011
01:40:27,283 --> 01:40:28,375
Where did he work?

1012
01:40:30,720 --> 01:40:31,914
ln a pharmaceutical company.

1013
01:40:32,656 --> 01:40:34,089
Then tell me the name
of the company.

1014
01:40:34,157 --> 01:40:35,055
You've been blabbering away
the same thing since when.

1015
01:40:35,125 --> 01:40:36,217
You lousy woman.

1016
01:40:37,027 --> 01:40:38,187
l can't remember, sir.

1017
01:40:40,030 --> 01:40:42,464
lt was a strange name.
l can't recollect it.

1018
01:40:43,133 --> 01:40:46,591
From where did you get the money?
-Money?

1019
01:40:48,405 --> 01:40:49,804
The wretch is pretending.

1020
01:40:50,306 --> 01:40:51,967
We confiscated an entire Rs.70,
000 from the attic.

1021
01:40:52,842 --> 01:40:53,934
Where did you get it from?

1022
01:40:54,210 --> 01:40:55,700
Who gave it to you and why?

1023
01:40:57,147 --> 01:40:58,512
l don't know.

1024
01:40:59,149 --> 01:41:00,616
Who were his acquaintances?

1025
01:41:04,487 --> 01:41:06,011
He used to be out of
town weeks on end.

1026
01:41:09,092 --> 01:41:10,150
Vishnu!

1027
01:41:12,962 --> 01:41:14,554
Were you his wife or his mistress?

1028
01:41:15,065 --> 01:41:17,226
Don't you know where your husband
went and what he did?

1029
01:41:18,134 --> 01:41:20,125
Sir, l don't know.

1030
01:41:26,009 --> 01:41:27,533
Have you got her brother?

1031
01:41:29,546 --> 01:41:31,241
Khoki, sir is calling you.

1032
01:41:42,325 --> 01:41:43,553
She's not opening her mouth.

1033
01:41:43,660 --> 01:41:44,752
You go and explain to her.

1034
01:41:46,062 --> 01:41:47,757
Sir, why don't you understand?

1035
01:41:48,098 --> 01:41:49,190
She's speaking the truth.

1036
01:41:49,999 --> 01:41:51,694
How can a woman know the
matters of a man?

1037
01:41:52,702 --> 01:41:54,465
Wouldn't they've questioned
their husbands before..

1038
01:41:54,604 --> 01:41:56,231
..if they could've thought
beyond the kitchen.

1039
01:41:56,706 --> 01:41:58,640
Bullets and guns were found
hidden in the house.

1040
01:41:59,008 --> 01:42:00,202
And she didn't know?

1041
01:42:00,744 --> 01:42:03,178
We've found Rs.70,000 in cash.
ln cash.

1042
01:42:03,880 --> 01:42:05,745
Wouldn't she have asked how
and where he got them from?

1043
01:42:06,483 --> 01:42:07,973
l told you the truth l knew.

1044
01:42:08,918 --> 01:42:11,182
How do l convince you?
She's innocent.

1045
01:42:12,322 --> 01:42:15,723
Sir, l climbed the steps of
the police station once..

1046
01:42:16,292 --> 01:42:17,816
..and my life was ruined forever.

1047
01:42:18,561 --> 01:42:20,085
l've been begging people for work.

1048
01:42:20,396 --> 01:42:22,830
People have labelled me as a
murderer and a terrorist.

1049
01:42:24,200 --> 01:42:25,963
l've two kids who are this small.

1050
01:42:26,903 --> 01:42:28,837
Now their lives will also
be ruined because of me.

1051
01:42:30,406 --> 01:42:32,169
God knows how l'm going
to raise them.

1052
01:42:33,877 --> 01:42:35,640
Save Bani at least, sir.

1053
01:42:36,312 --> 01:42:38,337
A hungry poor man
is like soft wax.

1054
01:42:38,715 --> 01:42:40,182
You can mould him as you want.

1055
01:42:40,250 --> 01:42:42,275
He'll become a terrorist
if you label him as one.

1056
01:42:43,052 --> 01:42:44,713
Then who will be responsible
for that, sir.

1057
01:42:45,255 --> 01:42:46,153
Tell me.

1058
01:42:47,457 --> 01:42:49,357
No government wants
us to get ruined.

1059
01:42:50,293 --> 01:42:52,284
All over the country communities
and societies are fighting..

1060
01:42:52,362 --> 01:42:53,488
..against the government.

1061
01:42:53,863 --> 01:42:56,388
But we still have faith
in law and order.

1062
01:42:57,934 --> 01:43:01,665
Then, sir, how will you repay us
for our loyalty and honesty?

1063
01:43:07,477 --> 01:43:10,878
Run. Run. Hurry up. Run. Run.

1064
01:43:13,950 --> 01:43:15,281
School was great fun, isn't it?

1065
01:43:15,385 --> 01:43:17,876
Run. We're getting late.
Hurry up. Hurry up.

1066
01:43:24,561 --> 01:43:26,927
Listen. Listen.

1067
01:43:30,733 --> 01:43:32,758
You'd dropped your pen.

1068
01:43:34,737 --> 01:43:35,669
Thank you.

1069
01:43:37,674 --> 01:43:39,164

1072
01:43:48,284 --> 01:43:50,184
My name is Hoky.

1073
01:43:50,787 --> 01:43:52,015
Let's go. -Okay.

1074
01:43:57,460 --> 01:43:59,394
Your shoes are so nice.

1075
01:43:59,495 --> 01:44:00,393
Are they new ones?

1076
01:44:00,463 --> 01:44:03,091
Yes. My father got them
for me yesterday.

1077
01:44:03,333 --> 01:44:05,267
What did you do with the old ones?

1078
01:44:05,335 --> 01:44:07,735
We threw them in the garbage bin.

1079
01:44:08,037 --> 01:44:10,403
ln the garbage bin? -Why?

1080
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:14,168
Why did you throw the shoes
in the garbage bin?

1081
01:44:14,277 --> 01:44:16,302
Because they were torn.

1082
01:44:54,817 --> 01:44:56,341

But where were you the
last three days?

1086
01:45:08,197 --> 01:45:09,186
Anyway, forget it.

1087
01:45:09,265 --> 01:45:12,132
Kids,
it's a very special day for us.

1088
01:45:12,902 --> 01:45:14,392

..for the first time since
the school opened.

Enough. Enough.

1092
01:45:24,013 --> 01:45:26,243
lt seems your father hasn't
told you anything today.

1093

Why? -My father passed away.

1094
01:45:29,485 --> 01:45:31,214
Henceforth,
