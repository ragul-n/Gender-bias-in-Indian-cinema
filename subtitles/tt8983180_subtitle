1
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:53,500
Welcome.

2
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:30,791
Baby, let's go to the room and have fun.

3
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,750
No, I am enjoying this.

4
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,041
Where is General Zeng?

5
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,250
General Zeng!

6
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:23,125
General Zeng!

7
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,875
General Zeng! General Zeng!

8
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:05,291
Zeng!

9
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,500
We are under pressure
form the foreign ministry.

10
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,208
We'll have to send our best officers.

11
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,541
I'm sending G. S. Gupta and A. L. Sharma
right away.

12
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,000
Let's go, sir.

13
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:32,541
Stay back.

14
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,500
Let's go, sir.

15
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:39,000
So, Dr. Vardhi, shall we begin?

16
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,666
Recognize this?

17
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:47,958
It's me.

18
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,583
I certainly can recognize myself.

19
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,833
And your partner as well?

20
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:53,791
Raghu.

21
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,375
What are you two doing
with General Zeng in this photo?

22
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:00,875
Are we not allowed to click
pictures with the Chinese?

23
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,333
This is the Chinese Government's
high profile case.

24
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:10,083
If proven that he was murdered here
then India will lose face in the UN.

25
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,958
He was here.

26
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:13,916
What is this?

27
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:22,833
Subtitles, please?

28
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,125
This is Tiger Soup.

29
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:26,458
He says that Tiger's body parts
are mixed in it.

30
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,291
I don't handle the manufacturing.

31
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:32,375
Okay then,
let's call the one who does.

32
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:34,291
Let's ask him.

33
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:35,958
Where is Raghu hiding?

34
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,166
It's a tough job that you guys do.

35
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,916
You need to go through so many files.

36
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:45,000
Then, in every case--

37
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:46,583
Sir, be quiet.

38
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,916
You will only talk when
he questions you. Okay?

39
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:51,708
Where is Raghu?

40
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:54,000
No idea, son.

41
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,041
Son?

42
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,541
I am no relative of yours.

43
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,541
Come to the point.
Where is Raghu hiding?

44
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:02,416
Since when have you been
selling this Tiger Soup?

45
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:06,458
Since the time Raghu
came back from China.

46
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:08,333
And why did Raghu go to China?

47
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,083
We searched his house.
We couldn't find anything.

48
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:17,458
We did find birds which
look like ostriches.

49
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,833
Emu.
It's called Emu.

50
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:28,000
Emu?

51
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:31,166
Yes. Raghu is a--

52
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:35,166
What do you call that in English? Enter...

53
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:38,458
No, another word for a businessman.

54
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,333
Sharma, it's enter...

55
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:44,541
Yes, that's what Raghu is.

56
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:49,041
Raghu has already tried
13 business ideas before this.

57
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,541
Selling its eggs is
a very profitable business.

58
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,625
At a five-star hotel,
each egg sells for 5000.

59
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,458
Hey, I am a vegetarian!

60
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:56,541
So what?

61
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:04,625
<span style="style.center_1">Raghu used to say</span>
<span style="style.center_1">that a businessman sells ideas</span>

62
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:07,833
<span style="style.center_1">whereas an entrepreneur makes ideas.</span>

63
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,958
<span style="style.center_1">All his ideas were great.</span>

64
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,083
<span style="style.center_1">But unfortunately,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">none of them worked.</span>

65
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,625
Square watermelons, sir.
100 percent organic.

66
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,166
I used the Japanese technique
to grow them.

67
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,791
It can easily fit into any refrigerator.

68
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,166
And there's a heart-shaped one
for valentine's day.

69
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,500
What is this nonsense?
Get it out of here.

70
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:24,541
<span style="style.center_1">No matter how many</span>
<span style="style.center_1">of his ideas flopped,</span>

71
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:29,166
<span style="style.center_1">he was always confident that his</span>
<span style="style.center_1">next idea would certainly be a hit.</span>

72
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,958
It's still a little raw, but...

73
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:33,541
But it works.

74
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:35,708
Give me another one.
It works.

75
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:38,333
<span style="style.center_1">He's very positive in life.</span>

76
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,208
Die, Raghu! Time to die!

77
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:50,791
I am Spiderman and
you are just a businessman.

78
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:51,833
Die!

79
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:53,708
-Rukmani!
-Yes?

80
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:56,083
Take him away.
Go.

81
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,083
-Chintu!
-Why are you pushing me?

82
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:00,500
Mummy, Raghu isn't getting up.

83
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,416
Hail the holy cow!

84
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,375
I paid the bill.

85
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:15,416
Thanks.

86
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,208
I've told you to use the other lights.

87
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:18,958
-It will reduce the bill.
-I'll do it next month.

88
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,291
Where are you going?
Have a seat.

89
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,500
I'm getting late.

90
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,750
Doesn't matter.
Eat some dessert before you leave.

91
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:26,750
Serve him some.

92
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:31,375
Those days, we were
selling Nepalese carpets.

93
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:35,250
But it was progressing
at a "Ghongha" speed.

94
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,166
Do you know what "Ghongha" is?

95
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,833
-Yes, "Ghongha."
-It means a snail.

96
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:41,541
Nepalese carpets.

97
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,041
Best carpets in the world.

98
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,375
Use this and you won't feel cold.

99
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:50,458
Get green tea for them.

100
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,125
Ginger or honey?

101
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:53,083
Just get it.

102
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,125
What a fool!

103
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:09,291
<span style="style.center_1">Raghu's father kept telling him</span>

104
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:12,958
<span style="style.center_1">to join the family business.</span>

105
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:15,458
<span style="style.center_1">But he never listened to him.</span>

106
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:19,791
<span style="style.center_1">And when he finally did,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">the business went bust.</span>

107
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:24,208
<span style="style.center_1">Now he keeps listening to Mr. Chopra.</span>

108
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:28,666
<span style="style.center_1">Your dreams are not like junk food.</span>

109
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:30,750
<span style="style.center_1">Don't undervalue them.</span>

110
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:32,625
Natukaka!

111
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:37,166
<span style="style.center_1">Those who undervalue their dreams...</span>

112
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:39,333
<span style="style.center_1">are just like sheep.</span>

113
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:45,416
<span style="style.center_1">They become a part of the crowd.</span>

114
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:49,750
<span style="style.center_1">You are filled with</span>
<span style="style.center_1">a volcano of possibilities.</span>

115
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,291
<span style="style.center_1">You can be Dhirubhai Ambani.</span>

116
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:54,916
<span style="style.center_1">You can be Laxmi Mittal.</span>

117
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,458
<span style="style.center_1">But this crowd wants</span>
<span style="style.center_1">you to sit in a cubical.</span>

118
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,916
<span style="style.center_1">It wants you to join</span>
<span style="style.center_1">the family business.</span>

119
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:04,583
<span style="style.center_1">This crowd has built</span>
<span style="style.center_1">a wall around you.</span>

120
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:11,458
<span style="style.center_1">It always keeps reminding you that</span>
<span style="style.center_1">you are worthless, and average.</span>

121
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:13,958
<span style="style.center_1">You can break this wall.</span>

122
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:16,250
<span style="style.center_1">Break this wall, do it.</span>

123
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,833
Devraj isn't my partner.

124
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,000
Devraj is my friend.

125
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:28,666
Not even a friend,
he's more like a brother.

126
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:31,833
And to all of you.

127
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,458
What is life?

128
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:43,916
It's a very big WhatsApp group
with God as its admin.

129
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:48,291
So keep forwarding happiness and
your life's data will stay unlimited.

130
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:50,583
Goodnight!

131
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:55,166
<span style="style.center_1">After these kind words from Mr. Chopra</span>

132
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,833
<span style="style.center_1">we have a performance by</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Mr. Mehta's daughter-in-law.</span>

133
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:00,750
<span style="style.center_1">"My veil flies away."</span>

134
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:03,250
<span style="style.center_1">Mrs. Rukmani,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">please come on the stage.</span>

135
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,291
<span style="style.center_1">My veil</span>

136
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:13,208
<span style="style.center_1">My veil flies away</span>

137
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:15,500
Come, let's dance.

138
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:34,458
<span style="style.center_1">My veil, I try to hold it down But it</span>
<span style="style.center_1">flies away</span>

139
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:42,208
<span style="style.center_1">My veil, I try to hold it down</span>
<span style="style.center_1">But it flies away</span>

140
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:44,083
<span style="style.center_1">With the wind, it flies away</span>

141
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:45,916
<span style="style.center_1">It makes my heart skip a beat</span>

142
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,791
<span style="style.center_1">With the wind, it flies away</span>

143
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:49,750
<span style="style.center_1">It makes my heart skip a beat</span>

144
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:53,000
<span style="style.center_1">It makes my heart sigh</span>

145
00:12:53,083 --> 00:13:00,041
<span style="style.center_1">My veil, I try to hold it down</span>
<span style="style.center_1">But it flies away</span>

146
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:04,041
<span style="style.center_1">Let the veil fly away</span>

147
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:07,708
<span style="style.center_1">Let the veil fly away</span>

148
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,041
She is your wife.

149
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,833
You can stare at her later.

150
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,000
Let's go. Dad is calling you.

151
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:18,125
Come here. Take this.

152
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:29,708
-Having a good time, Bhide?
-Thoroughly.

153
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:30,833
Enjoying yourself.

154
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,041
-Hello.
-Hi.

155
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:36,625
Did you take a tour of our new house?

156
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:38,625
-Well...
-Or, did you come here for free dinner?

157
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,500
No, I saw it, it's nice.

158
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:41,625
It's nice.

159
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:42,958
Chagan?

160
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:44,500
-Yes, sir?
-What is this?

161
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,375
Cake.

162
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:49,375
Stupid, even I can see that.

163
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:52,375
Is it with eggs or without eggs in it?

164
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,458
-Sir, you told me--
-Listen.

165
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,958
I am the trustee of Hatkeshwar temple.

166
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,125
I don't eat cakes
which have eggs in them.

167
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:00,708
Take it away.

168
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:02,750
Keep it down.

169
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,500
-Take this away as well.
-Okay, sir.

170
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,208
How much did you make today?

171
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:18,458
-12.
-Thousand?

172
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:20,458
1200!

173
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:21,833
1200!

174
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:27,416
What's 20 percent of that?

175
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,750
240!

176
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:30,208
Great.

177
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:31,791
Amazing.

178
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:33,500
So...

179
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,750
what's new?

180
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,750
I have a few new ideas in mind.

181
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,166
Where are you going?

182
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,166
-I'll go check on Chintu.
-Sit. Chintu!

183
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:47,666
He isn't going anywhere.
Sit down.

184
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,000
Dad, it's okay, he's trying.

185
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,625
What the hell is he trying?

186
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:58,583
No one is going to buy your
Nepalese carpets in Navrang Pura.

187
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,250
A margin of only 20-30 bucks,
you call this a business?

188
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:07,708
How will you pay Chintu's school fees?

189
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,333
I'm handling Chintu's school fees.

190
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,291
Why don't you talk
some sense into him?

191
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,125
Meet Bhide.

192
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,708
Bhide is interested in your shop.

193
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,541
When do you want to finalize the deal?

194
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:25,208
-But the shop--
-Shut up.

195
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,291
When do you want to finalize the deal?

196
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,291
Do you want me to sell my
father's shop and stay at home?

197
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:30,250
No.

198
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:36,291
Just castrate the new ideas
that keep popping into your mind.

199
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,333
Look.

200
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:43,125
Join Devraj in his new business.

201
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,750
An Ayurvedic products' company
worth 1200 million.

202
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:51,416
We need reliable family members
to join the family business.

203
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:54,916
Listen.

204
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,791
He is going to China next week.

205
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,041
You should go with him.

206
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,875
Try your luck.

207
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,333
What will I do in China, Dad?

208
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:03,000
-My shop--
-Come with me to China.

209
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:06,083
I'll introduce you to a few investors.

210
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,291
But China--

211
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:09,000
Don't be so scared of China.

212
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:11,125
I am not sending you
to Kavakistan or Syria.

213
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:12,375
It's only China.

214
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,333
Bhide, let's have some desserts.

215
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,625
I'll drop you to the airport.

216
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:27,791
Digestive?

217
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:29,750
No? Let's go.

218
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:34,333
Rukmani, I'm sending him to China.

219
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:37,750
Do you have a passport?

220
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:40,250
Yes.

221
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,000
You don't need anything else then.

222
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:46,041
Come on.

223
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:06,541
Rukmani.

224
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:08,291
I am not going to China.

225
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:10,875
Why did you have to agree?

226
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,875
Do you want to tear my shirt?

227
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:21,041
Rukmani, China?

228
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,375
Do you know how far it is?

229
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,750
-The door.
-Okay.

230
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:28,458
Do you know how far China is?

231
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:32,750
I heard they eat snakes there.

232
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:34,208
Then you too can have one.

233
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:38,291
I don't know why
you always overreact.

234
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,000
I overreact.

235
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:42,291
You don't even do that.

236
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:43,458
Don't do anything.

237
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,250
I'll go back home, to Mumbai.

238
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,375
Stop with your threats
of going back to Mumbai.

239
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:51,875
-Emu's offspring, Jamway's agency--
-Eggs.

240
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:53,750
Whatever! Emu's eggs!

241
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,875
Jamway's agency, roti maker.

242
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,833
Did I ever complain?

243
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:00,083
I have always encouraged you.

244
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,375
And I am trying.

245
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,416
What's so special about China?

246
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,833
They sell cheap quality products.

247
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:13,125
There's nothing special there.

248
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:16,166
You'll get another
opportunity in China, Raghu.

249
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,166
I have to hear this because
I am going through a bad phase.

250
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:24,708
You know what Mr. Chopra said?

251
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,416
As they say, it's the darkest before dawn.

252
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:32,458
We are going through that darkness.

253
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,958
Do one thing, Raghu.

254
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:38,416
Go screw yourself.

255
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:42,041
Language, Rukmani!
Chintu might hear you.

256
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:44,416
Fine, I'll wash the clothes.

257
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,041
I wonder where you
learn all this from.

258
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,125
Rukmani, China?

259
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:51,750
Why don't you come with me?

260
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,791
We'll go there and have chow mein.

261
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:07,958
<span style="style.center_1">O dear, do buy something for me</span>
<span style="style.center_1">From the fair</span>

262
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:13,166
<span style="style.center_1">But do come soon, O darling</span>

263
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:18,166
<span style="style.center_1">You are an ocean of love</span>
<span style="style.center_1">I am thirsty, O dear</span>

264
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:22,666
<span style="style.center_1">Do come soon</span>

265
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:28,500
<span style="style.center_1">How can your beloved be so handsome?</span>

266
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:33,291
<span style="style.center_1">My mirror questions me</span>

267
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:39,916
<span style="style.center_1">How could I be so fortunate?</span>

268
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:43,916
<span style="style.center_1">I still cannot believe my luck</span>

269
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,750
<span style="style.center_1">I keep warding the evil away</span>

270
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:49,375
<span style="style.center_1">I keep you hidden away</span>

271
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:54,541
<span style="style.center_1">May no harm come to you</span>

272
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:58,708
<span style="style.center_1">I love you</span>

273
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:02,083
<span style="style.center_1">Like I have never loved before</span>

274
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:09,208
<span style="style.center_1">If I don't love you with all my heart</span>

275
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,208
<span style="style.center_1">It's not love</span>

276
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:19,750
<span style="style.center_1">I love you</span>

277
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,291
<span style="style.center_1">Like I have never loved before</span>

278
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:31,500
<span style="style.center_1">O dear, do buy something for me</span>
<span style="style.center_1">From the fair</span>

279
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:34,750
<span style="style.center_1">But do come soon, O darling</span>

280
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,625
Tell me something, Rukmani.

281
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:42,750
Even after so many failures...
do you still love me?

282
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:50,541
<span style="style.center_1">I have never made</span>

283
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:56,541
<span style="style.center_1">A special wish until now</span>

284
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:00,583
<span style="style.center_1">But yet,</span>

285
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:03,500
<span style="style.center_1">Our stars united</span>

286
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:07,333
<span style="style.center_1">In the sky somehow</span>

287
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:10,333
<span style="style.center_1">I keep warding the evil away</span>

288
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:12,791
<span style="style.center_1">I keep you hidden away</span>

289
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,791
<span style="style.center_1">May no harm come to you</span>

290
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:22,166
<span style="style.center_1">I love you</span>

291
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:26,500
<span style="style.center_1">Like I have never loved before</span>

292
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:31,666
<span style="style.center_1">If I don't love you with all my heart</span>

293
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,375
<span style="style.center_1">It's not love</span>

294
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:44,500
<span style="style.center_1">O dear, do buy something for me</span>
<span style="style.center_1">From the fair</span>

295
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:49,500
<span style="style.center_1">But do come soon, O darling</span>

296
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:54,708
<span style="style.center_1">I am your love nest, O flying bird</span>

297
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,208
<span style="style.center_1">Do come soon</span>

298
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:01,833
<span style="style.center_1">You know Aunt Dhaani?</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Raghu's neighbor?</span>

299
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:04,416
<span style="style.center_1">Raghu treats her like his mother.</span>

300
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:07,208
<span style="style.center_1">She has weak eyesight.</span>

301
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:09,375
Raghu later...

302
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:15,666
Sir! This conversation will
only lead to me having a migraine.

303
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,291
-When I was small, I fell...
-Sir.

304
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:19,333
Raghu is here.

305
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,583
You arrested him?

306
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:23,000
No, he surrendered.

307
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:28,166
Sir.

308
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:29,458
Raghu is here.

309
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,458
Tea?

310
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:46,666
So?

311
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:50,166
I am calm because you came to me.

312
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:52,583
So, tell me.

313
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:55,500
What does this contain?

314
00:22:59,708 --> 00:23:01,125
Normal stuff, sir.

315
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:04,250
Milk, sugar, cream.

316
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,291
And a Chinese tiger's part?

317
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:13,000
By part, you mean penis?

318
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:15,000
No, sir.

319
00:23:15,291 --> 00:23:17,625
Why would anyone mix a Chinese
tiger's penis in a medicine?

320
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,416
And for that matter, why would
anyone mix any body part in it?

321
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,583
Then did you go to
China to have chow mein?

322
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:27,583
I didn't go to China willingly, sir.
I was forced to.

323
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:30,291
Tell me everything.

324
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:47,375
<span style="style.center_1">I wasn't too eager to go to China.</span>
<span style="style.center_1">I was forced to.</span>

325
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:51,291
<span style="style.center_1">The only positive aspect</span>
<span style="style.center_1">of it was Rukmani's hope,</span>

326
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:53,583
<span style="style.center_1">that with the blessings</span>
<span style="style.center_1">of the Chinese dragon</span>

327
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:55,750
<span style="style.center_1">I'll surely find</span>
<span style="style.center_1">a new business idea there.</span>

328
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:20,625
Wait here,
I'll go and confirm the booking.

329
00:24:43,458 --> 00:24:45,375
-Done?
-There's a problem.

330
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,291
They don't have enough rooms.

331
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:50,625
I have booked you
a room in another hotel.

332
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:54,125
You just learnt that?
How will I stay alone?

333
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:55,166
Do you have a problem?

334
00:24:56,166 --> 00:24:57,458
-No.
-It's a nice hotel.

335
00:24:57,541 --> 00:24:58,833
It's called the Dancing Dragon.

336
00:24:58,916 --> 00:25:01,291
It's in that lane, not too far away.

337
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:03,833
They have a small-eyed
dinosaur placed outside the door.

338
00:25:03,916 --> 00:25:06,208
Be careful about what you eat.
Most of the food here has meat in it.

339
00:25:06,291 --> 00:25:07,875
Sparrows, crows, ducks.

340
00:25:08,041 --> 00:25:08,958
They eat everything.

341
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:11,000
Even their fruits aren't
considered vegetarian.

342
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:12,625
-I have brought <span style="style.center_1">thepla.</span>
-Good.

343
00:25:12,708 --> 00:25:14,708
Stick to <span style="style.center_1">thepla.</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Thepla</span> is good for health.

344
00:25:15,833 --> 00:25:16,791
Xui Lee!

345
00:25:19,375 --> 00:25:20,875
Be ready by 8 tonight.

346
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:22,708
We are meeting a successful investor.

347
00:25:22,791 --> 00:25:23,708
-When?
-At 8.

348
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,166
Julie.

349
00:25:31,708 --> 00:25:32,541
Xui Lee.

350
00:25:33,583 --> 00:25:34,458
Julie.

351
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:35,791
Xui...

352
00:25:36,375 --> 00:25:37,500
Ju...

353
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:39,250
Never mind.

354
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:44,083
I have prepared some notes for you.

355
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:45,291
Memorize them.

356
00:25:45,541 --> 00:25:47,750
Go and say it in the
ayurvedic shops nearby.

357
00:25:48,791 --> 00:25:50,916
But it's in Chinese.
What does it mean?

358
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,500
Why do you want to know the meaning?

359
00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:54,541
They will know what it means.

360
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:57,000
Memorize it and say it.

361
00:25:57,666 --> 00:25:59,000
Okay?
Go.

362
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:01,000
Go to your hotel now.

363
00:26:17,708 --> 00:26:21,250
Hello, my name is Raghu Mehta.

364
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:24,333
I am here to sell
you JeevanSutra products.

365
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,083
We have...

366
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:29,500
We have a range of organic
Ayurvedic products from India.

367
00:26:29,833 --> 00:26:31,750
I also have the samples.

368
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:34,416
Samples.

369
00:26:35,666 --> 00:26:37,666
I also have the samples.

370
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:42,666
What a language!

371
00:27:23,166 --> 00:27:26,708
<span style="style.center_1">Mr. Chopra always says, never</span>
<span style="style.center_1">treat your struggle as a challenge.</span>

372
00:27:26,958 --> 00:27:30,666
Hello, my name is Raghu Mehta.

373
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:32,416
I am here to sell
you JeevanSutra products.

374
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,666
<span style="style.center_1">It is an opportunity.</span>

375
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,208
<span style="style.center_1">It can take you very far.</span>

376
00:27:38,083 --> 00:27:40,875
<span style="style.center_1">You can never get close</span>
<span style="style.center_1">to success without any struggle.</span>

377
00:27:43,375 --> 00:27:45,708
<span style="style.center_1">I was treating my struggle</span>
<span style="style.center_1">as an opportunity.</span>

378
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:50,166
<span style="style.center_1">Yet, my condition was worse</span>
<span style="style.center_1">than a Jamway's salesman.</span>

379
00:28:16,166 --> 00:28:17,166
Ashwagandha.

380
00:28:18,583 --> 00:28:23,000
It's known as winter cherry in America
and poison gooseberry in London.

381
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:26,500
They sell it as a
sports performance drug.

382
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:33,500
China's sports energy drink's
market is worth 350 million dollars.

383
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:39,000
We should sell Ashwagandha
as an Indian herbal sports drink.

384
00:28:39,541 --> 00:28:40,625
There is a lot of scope.

385
00:28:49,125 --> 00:28:50,166
Ash Bull.

386
00:29:21,291 --> 00:29:23,541
You asked me to come all the
way from India to say this?

387
00:29:38,166 --> 00:29:39,041
Dev?

388
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:40,875
-Should I...
-Do as you please.

389
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,208
<span style="style.center_1">Thepla.</span>

390
00:29:56,708 --> 00:29:57,666
You're a Gujarati?

391
00:29:58,166 --> 00:29:59,208
Give me one.

392
00:29:59,916 --> 00:30:01,125
Really?

393
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,375
Here.

394
00:30:04,708 --> 00:30:06,208
Take two of these.

395
00:30:09,916 --> 00:30:12,000
<span style="style.center_1">Thepla</span> is like God, for a Gujarati.

396
00:30:12,458 --> 00:30:13,791
Especially in China.

397
00:30:17,541 --> 00:30:18,625
Raghuveer Mehta.

398
00:30:20,375 --> 00:30:22,791
Nepal handicraft business.
Ahmadabad.

399
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,250
Your brother?

400
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:36,666
I'm leaving.

401
00:30:37,083 --> 00:30:38,416
Let me know if you need any help.

402
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:39,958
Your card?

403
00:30:56,708 --> 00:30:57,541
Forget it!

404
00:31:09,875 --> 00:31:11,291
I have tried 13 businesses so far.

405
00:31:11,583 --> 00:31:14,041
I tried selling a lot of things,
but in vain.

406
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:15,041
Come on.

407
00:31:37,833 --> 00:31:41,291
Indian delicacy, <span style="style.center_1">thepla</span>.

408
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:42,333
<span style="style.center_1">Thepla?</span>

409
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:43,916
<span style="style.center_1">Thepla.</span>

410
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:03,083
Tanmay, you sold <span style="style.center_1">thepla</span>
like it was the Kohinoor.

411
00:32:09,541 --> 00:32:10,666
-Tanmay?
-Yes?

412
00:32:14,125 --> 00:32:15,000
Why?

413
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,541
No one has ever called
me an entrepreneur.

414
00:32:18,625 --> 00:32:20,083
And today, you did.

415
00:32:28,291 --> 00:32:33,125
I have a gut feeling that someday,
you will be a successful entrepreneur.

416
00:32:36,625 --> 00:32:40,375
Once you understand
the concept of "The Key"!

417
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,291
The concept of "The Key"?

418
00:32:45,583 --> 00:32:47,416
Who is the customer?

419
00:32:52,375 --> 00:32:55,541
The customer is an idiot.

420
00:32:56,791 --> 00:32:59,458
The customer is an idiot.

421
00:32:59,541 --> 00:33:00,375
What is he?

422
00:33:00,458 --> 00:33:02,500
-How can I say that?
-You'll have to repeat it.

423
00:33:02,666 --> 00:33:03,541
Say it.

424
00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:08,750
-The customer is an idiot.
-The customer is an idiot.

425
00:33:09,875 --> 00:33:11,000
And why so?

426
00:33:11,125 --> 00:33:12,125
Why so?

427
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:13,416
Don't repeat that.

428
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,625
I am asking you.

429
00:33:14,708 --> 00:33:16,208
-Okay.
-Why so?

430
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,791
-Why?
-I don't know.

431
00:33:18,916 --> 00:33:20,458
Because the customer is naive.

432
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:23,541
-I see.
-He doesn't know what he wants.

433
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,833
You need to tell him that.

434
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,916
How?

435
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,500
-By singing a song.
-A song?

436
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:31,041
-By singing a song.
-Which song?

437
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:34,208
<span style="style.center_1">Tell me, oh naive one, what do you want?</span>

438
00:33:34,375 --> 00:33:35,250
Say it.

439
00:33:35,541 --> 00:33:36,625
"Trimurti" directed by Subhash Ghai!

440
00:33:36,708 --> 00:33:40,083
<span style="style.center_1">Tell me, oh naive one, what do you want?</span>

441
00:33:40,166 --> 00:33:43,000
<span style="style.center_1">Tell me, oh naive one, what do you want?</span>

442
00:33:43,208 --> 00:33:45,416
No, no. With vigor!

443
00:33:46,083 --> 00:33:49,416
<span style="style.center_1">Tell me, oh naive one, what do you want?</span>

444
00:33:50,458 --> 00:33:54,333
<span style="style.center_1">Tell me, oh naive one, what do you want?</span>

445
00:33:54,416 --> 00:33:56,041
<span style="style.center_1">-I am a lover...</span>
-Hey!

446
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,083
What happens after you sing the song?

447
00:33:58,708 --> 00:34:00,833
The customer will
tell me what he wants.

448
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:02,541
But the customer is...

449
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,541
-Oh yes, he is an idiot.
-Yes.

450
00:34:05,083 --> 00:34:06,750
He'll tell you shit.

451
00:34:06,958 --> 00:34:08,333
He won't tell you.

452
00:34:08,416 --> 00:34:10,375
The customer only shows.

453
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:11,875
His need.

454
00:34:12,291 --> 00:34:14,500
He shows us his need.

455
00:34:15,083 --> 00:34:17,000
What's the customer's need?

456
00:34:17,833 --> 00:34:19,375
Inexpensive goods, good quality goods?

457
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:21,833
The customer's need is the lock.

458
00:34:22,291 --> 00:34:23,166
A lock.

459
00:34:23,666 --> 00:34:24,500
A lock?

460
00:34:24,583 --> 00:34:26,666
The customer's need is the lock.

461
00:34:27,041 --> 00:34:30,250
And the day you find the key...

462
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,291
you'll be an entrepreneur.

463
00:34:34,875 --> 00:34:36,250
The key!

464
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,541
Tanmay,
you can keep these <span style="style.center_1">theplas.</span>

465
00:35:06,708 --> 00:35:07,708
Where is your brother?

466
00:35:07,791 --> 00:35:11,000
I knocked for so long how come it took
so long for you to open the door?

467
00:35:11,625 --> 00:35:13,666
Where is your brother?

468
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:15,416
I don't understand. Talk in English.

469
00:35:28,166 --> 00:35:30,041
My whole life...

470
00:35:30,125 --> 00:35:31,000
Where is he?

471
00:35:31,083 --> 00:35:31,916
Keep it down.

472
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Don't do this to me, okay?
I beg you.

473
00:35:34,083 --> 00:35:35,083
Listen to me.

474
00:36:34,708 --> 00:36:35,708
Alcohol?

475
00:36:37,041 --> 00:36:38,500
You, me, alcohol?

476
00:36:39,375 --> 00:36:41,875
That's great! You speak Hindi!

477
00:36:42,708 --> 00:36:43,750
-Alcohol?
-Alcohol?

478
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:57,250
China's Falguni Pathak.

479
00:37:00,458 --> 00:37:02,250
After two drinks I eat egg.

480
00:37:10,041 --> 00:37:11,541
Boiled is urine?

481
00:37:16,916 --> 00:37:19,041
What kind of a place is this?
You guys eat anything!

482
00:37:19,791 --> 00:37:22,125
You will also eat shit
for dessert with some sugar in it.

483
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,750
I didn't show you my wife's picture.

484
00:37:26,333 --> 00:37:27,166
Rukmani.

485
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:28,833
I came to China because of her.

486
00:37:29,791 --> 00:37:31,500
I want to keep her happy.

487
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:34,958
She has suffered a lot because of me.

488
00:37:41,833 --> 00:37:45,125
Look Rukmani, they boil eggs in urine.

489
00:37:48,208 --> 00:37:51,250
Julie Ben, a song dedicated to you.

490
00:37:52,875 --> 00:37:54,166
<span style="style.center_1">I am an angel</span>

491
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:59,416
<span style="style.center_1">Don't touch me</span>

492
00:38:02,708 --> 00:38:03,875
<span style="style.center_1">I am an angel</span>

493
00:38:04,541 --> 00:38:05,875
<span style="style.center_1">I am an angel</span>

494
00:38:07,708 --> 00:38:08,958
<span style="style.center_1">I am an angel</span>

495
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,958
<span style="style.center_1">Julie! Julie! Julie!</span>

496
00:38:28,041 --> 00:38:29,125
<span style="style.center_1">Come here! Come here!</span>

497
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:30,875
<span style="style.center_1">Come here! Come here!</span>

498
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,583
-Julie Ben.
-Come here.

499
00:38:33,041 --> 00:38:35,625
You know, "Ben" means sister.

500
00:38:43,166 --> 00:38:44,916
-Julie Ben.
-Julie Ben.

501
00:38:45,083 --> 00:38:46,333
You have a good life here.

502
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:50,958
For me it's only home
to office and office to home.

503
00:39:02,666 --> 00:39:04,250
What?

504
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:13,083
Aoli? I don't know any Aoli.

505
00:39:25,291 --> 00:39:26,625
I'll meet him, Julie Ben.

506
00:39:27,416 --> 00:39:28,458
No worries.

507
00:39:34,416 --> 00:39:35,291
Aoli?

508
00:39:40,041 --> 00:39:41,000
We are already here.

509
00:39:41,791 --> 00:39:43,500
Yes. Okay.

510
00:39:52,375 --> 00:39:53,208
Bye.

511
00:40:47,875 --> 00:40:49,125
Hurry up! What's wrong!

512
00:40:49,208 --> 00:40:51,125
We don't have time to wait!
Put it down here!

513
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:01,916
Oh, roar.

514
00:41:59,958 --> 00:42:01,125
Be mindful.

515
00:42:02,833 --> 00:42:03,833
Be mindful!

516
00:42:05,041 --> 00:42:06,666
Be mindful.

517
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:10,500
Yes, good boy.
Be mindful.

518
00:42:25,166 --> 00:42:27,625
<span style="style.center_1">What's the most powerful thing</span>
<span style="style.center_1">in this world?</span>

519
00:42:29,916 --> 00:42:31,250
Our mind.

520
00:42:32,208 --> 00:42:34,583
<span style="style.center_1">Because it a pot full of ideas.</span>

521
00:42:34,666 --> 00:42:36,916
<span style="style.center_1">All great ideas develop here.</span>

522
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,625
From Jumbo King to Jumbo Jet,
from Pan Parag to Panasonic.

523
00:42:41,708 --> 00:42:43,416
<span style="style.center_1">All great ideas developed here.</span>

524
00:42:44,708 --> 00:42:46,958
<span style="style.center_1">We Indians think about sex 24/7.</span>

525
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,041
<span style="style.center_1">But we never talk about it.</span>

526
00:42:49,666 --> 00:42:50,708
<span style="style.center_1">We don't mention it.</span>

527
00:42:51,708 --> 00:42:53,750
<span style="style.center_1">Our country is the biggest</span>
<span style="style.center_1">"crowd" in the world.</span>

528
00:42:54,208 --> 00:42:57,041
<span style="style.center_1">And "sex" is its biggest need.</span>

529
00:42:58,458 --> 00:43:01,458
<span style="style.center_1">According to Tanmay</span>
<span style="style.center_1">the customer's need is the lock.</span>

530
00:43:02,625 --> 00:43:04,791
<span style="style.center_1">Hao Li had shown me</span>
<span style="style.center_1">"the key" to that lock.</span>

531
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:15,500
What are you looking at?

532
00:43:15,916 --> 00:43:17,166
Nothing.

533
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:18,416
It's been quite long.

534
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:19,958
Let's do it.

535
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:23,583
-Come on.
-Yes.

536
00:43:28,541 --> 00:43:29,666
Careful there.

537
00:43:29,875 --> 00:43:31,541
Rukmani?

538
00:43:32,125 --> 00:43:33,291
Just asking.

539
00:43:35,041 --> 00:43:36,875
Are you happy with me?

540
00:43:37,125 --> 00:43:38,416
Yes, I am happy.

541
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:41,375
No.
Not that kind of happy.

542
00:43:42,875 --> 00:43:45,166
By happy, I mean, content.

543
00:43:45,375 --> 00:43:47,666
-Are you referring to the milkman?
-No.

544
00:43:48,875 --> 00:43:51,541
I mean satisfaction.

545
00:43:51,666 --> 00:43:53,916
I know. I went to
an English medium school.

546
00:43:54,375 --> 00:43:56,500
What are you trying to say?

547
00:43:59,458 --> 00:44:00,333
Okay.

548
00:44:02,291 --> 00:44:06,500
Tell me, when we...

549
00:44:06,791 --> 00:44:09,125
-When we what? Fight?
-No!

550
00:44:12,041 --> 00:44:15,125
When we do it at night
and sometimes during the day.

551
00:44:17,583 --> 00:44:19,541
Yes, sex.

552
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:23,166
Do I make you happy?

553
00:44:24,041 --> 00:44:25,916
Do you reach the top floor?

554
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:30,708
I am serious.
Why are you laughing?

555
00:44:32,333 --> 00:44:35,875
I reach the top floor
and even enjoy the view.

556
00:44:38,166 --> 00:44:39,833
So the lift's working properly.

557
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,083
The lift and the lift man's
working perfectly.

558
00:44:42,541 --> 00:44:44,916
But good, I am happy that you asked.

559
00:44:45,458 --> 00:44:49,875
In fact, there are husbands
who don't satisfy their wives.

560
00:44:49,958 --> 00:44:51,666
I wonder what they do.

561
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:57,666
Rukmani, there are so many husbands
who are unable to satisfy their wives.

562
00:44:58,833 --> 00:45:00,958
You know how many kinds
of problems men face?

563
00:45:02,083 --> 00:45:04,458
Premature ejaculation, inhibited
ejaculation, retrograde ejaculation,

564
00:45:04,541 --> 00:45:07,250
wet dreams, mistakes made
during adolescence, impotency,

565
00:45:07,333 --> 00:45:10,125
low sperm count, low sexual desire,
erectile dysfunction.

566
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:13,583
But there are medicines for
all these problems. And toys too.

567
00:45:13,916 --> 00:45:16,041
You have done a lot of
research about these things.

568
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:18,583
It is a very big market.

569
00:45:18,958 --> 00:45:19,916
Lots of money in it.

570
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,625
Maybe, so what?

571
00:45:21,708 --> 00:45:23,666
There are many inappropriate
products available in the market.

572
00:45:23,916 --> 00:45:26,458
You should concentrate
on your carpets' market.

573
00:45:26,541 --> 00:45:27,666
Come on, let's go for a smoke.

574
00:45:29,916 --> 00:45:31,375
Yes, carpets.

575
00:45:36,458 --> 00:45:41,750
<span style="style.center_1">I got the hint that my 21st-century wife's</span>
<span style="style.center_1">liberated side</span>

576
00:45:41,875 --> 00:45:45,166
<span style="style.center_1">was restricted to secretly</span>
<span style="style.center_1">smoking with her husband.</span>

577
00:45:46,875 --> 00:45:48,083
Erectile dysfunction.

578
00:45:48,875 --> 00:45:51,791
Viagra, tadalafil,
sildenafil, levitra, vardenafil.

579
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:52,833
They sell like hotcakes.

580
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:55,458
What medicine are you going to supply?

581
00:45:56,875 --> 00:45:58,250
Have you heard about tiger soup?

582
00:45:58,333 --> 00:45:59,250
What?

583
00:45:59,333 --> 00:46:01,500
It's made from the tiger's penis.

584
00:46:01,583 --> 00:46:03,666
Hang up.
You think this is funny?

585
00:46:04,291 --> 00:46:06,833
<span style="style.center_1">Are you high on some cheap drug?</span>
<span style="style.center_1">You'll get us into trouble.</span>

586
00:46:10,375 --> 00:46:11,666
<span style="style.center_1">One thing was for certain.</span>

587
00:46:12,708 --> 00:46:17,583
<span style="style.center_1">To find a genuine solution to the</span>
<span style="style.center_1">problems men faced, was also a problem.</span>

588
00:46:18,541 --> 00:46:20,208
<span style="style.center_1">And the problem</span>
<span style="style.center_1">of getting it to the people.</span>

589
00:46:20,291 --> 00:46:22,916
Raman, please advise me,
how do I approach this business?

590
00:46:36,333 --> 00:46:37,166
-What are you saying?
-And for that

591
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:40,333
you'll need to make
a hakim, an astrologist

592
00:46:40,416 --> 00:46:42,958
or a good doctor your partner.

593
00:46:43,041 --> 00:46:44,000
Partnership.

594
00:46:44,208 --> 00:46:49,583
But remember, there are many charlatans
in this line of business as well.

595
00:46:50,625 --> 00:46:51,666
Understood?

596
00:46:51,958 --> 00:46:53,750
<span style="style.center_1">Raman was absolutely right.</span>

597
00:46:54,708 --> 00:46:57,041
<span style="style.center_1">To find a true and honest</span>
<span style="style.center_1">partner in this field</span>

598
00:46:57,541 --> 00:46:59,458
<span style="style.center_1">was like finding a</span>
<span style="style.center_1">needle in a haystack.</span>

599
00:46:59,541 --> 00:47:02,916
<span style="style.center_1">What's the secret?</span>
<span style="style.center_1">What's got you so upset?</span>

600
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,791
<span style="style.center_1">My parrot has a solution for everything</span>

601
00:47:14,083 --> 00:47:16,791
Due to mistakes made during
adolescence, I face some issues.

602
00:47:17,416 --> 00:47:19,458
I cannot satisfy my wife.
Is there a solution?

603
00:47:19,541 --> 00:47:21,083
Do you play?

604
00:47:21,583 --> 00:47:22,583
Play?

605
00:47:25,708 --> 00:47:26,625
Play!

606
00:47:26,708 --> 00:47:29,083
Stop playing with it.

607
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:30,833
Okay.

608
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:31,833
Any medicines?

609
00:47:31,916 --> 00:47:33,250
That is the only solution.

610
00:47:44,541 --> 00:47:46,041
We'll need do some x-rays.

611
00:47:46,125 --> 00:47:48,166
A full body check
up will also be done.

612
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:51,916
We have a special machine,
red light, green light.

613
00:47:53,208 --> 00:47:56,208
If we get a green light,
then medicines can cure it.

614
00:47:56,291 --> 00:47:58,250
But if it's a red light then...

615
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:01,625
There's nothing to worry about,
but we'll have to do an angioplasty.

616
00:48:05,625 --> 00:48:06,666
It's not fractured.

617
00:48:08,875 --> 00:48:09,916
Take this.

618
00:48:10,208 --> 00:48:11,291
We'll have to take control
of your mind and body for a month.

619
00:48:11,375 --> 00:48:13,625
We'll have to keep you
subjugated for another month.

620
00:48:13,791 --> 00:48:16,250
Physical issues, weakness,
family issues, dissatisfaction.

621
00:48:16,333 --> 00:48:17,875
Everything will get cured.

622
00:48:17,958 --> 00:48:19,416
Drink this solution.

623
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:23,708
You and your wife will be surprised
with the results after two months.

624
00:48:24,166 --> 00:48:25,041
What will happen?

625
00:48:26,916 --> 00:48:30,458
Mind-blowing, amazing sex!

626
00:48:32,875 --> 00:48:34,083
Isn't he great?

627
00:48:34,416 --> 00:48:35,916
He'll harden everything.

628
00:48:41,125 --> 00:48:43,333
Do I have to take a right turn?

629
00:48:45,666 --> 00:48:50,583
Roti, <span style="style.center_1">thepla,</span> they are round in shape.

630
00:48:50,875 --> 00:48:52,625
Have triangular foodstuff.

631
00:48:52,708 --> 00:48:54,666
I have been having
samosas since childhood.

632
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:56,666
With green chutney?

633
00:48:56,875 --> 00:48:59,541
-Yes.
-Try red chutney instead.

634
00:48:59,833 --> 00:49:03,416
All your sex-related
problems will get cured.

635
00:49:03,708 --> 00:49:05,041
Stay blessed.

636
00:49:10,791 --> 00:49:13,791
Why have they still not
filed his papers, his IT Returns?

637
00:49:13,958 --> 00:49:16,458
I don't know what's happening.
I'll go outside and check.

638
00:49:24,708 --> 00:49:25,625
Jagdesh.

639
00:49:26,333 --> 00:49:27,166
You may go inside.

640
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:47,250
You have insomnia.

641
00:49:48,458 --> 00:49:51,375
You sleep less than
seven hours at night?

642
00:49:53,041 --> 00:49:54,083
Yes.

643
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:55,750
You drink before you sleep?

644
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:57,625
You smoke?

645
00:49:57,708 --> 00:49:58,833
Sometimes, a cigarette.

646
00:50:01,333 --> 00:50:02,416
No.

647
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,833
You don't have a problem.

648
00:50:03,916 --> 00:50:05,250
You don't need a sexologist.

649
00:50:05,333 --> 00:50:06,916
You only have insomnia.

650
00:50:07,666 --> 00:50:08,708
Understand.

651
00:50:10,958 --> 00:50:12,166
No fees.

652
00:50:19,666 --> 00:50:20,916
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

653
00:50:22,291 --> 00:50:24,750
You believed me when I said
that you don't have a problem.

654
00:50:24,833 --> 00:50:27,291
This means you know that
you don't have a problem.

655
00:50:27,375 --> 00:50:28,875
Why did you come here?

656
00:50:30,833 --> 00:50:34,458
I came to check whether you are a fake
like the other sexologists.

657
00:50:36,291 --> 00:50:37,375
So, did I pass?

658
00:50:37,541 --> 00:50:39,208
-Absolutely.
-Okay, go.

659
00:50:46,916 --> 00:50:48,916
I have an amazing offer for you.

660
00:50:49,708 --> 00:50:51,416
I want you to be my business partner.

661
00:50:52,458 --> 00:50:55,208
I have a product that
can cure sex-related problems.

662
00:50:56,166 --> 00:50:57,958
My product, your patients

663
00:50:58,041 --> 00:50:59,500
and we will split the profit.

664
00:50:59,958 --> 00:51:00,791
What do you think?

665
00:51:04,791 --> 00:51:05,958
See this goat?

666
00:51:08,458 --> 00:51:09,416
Prabha.

667
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:12,208
She calms me down when I get angry.

668
00:51:14,625 --> 00:51:16,291
But she gets angry very easily.

669
00:51:16,916 --> 00:51:19,000
I'd suggest you leave
before she gets angry.

670
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:21,125
Go.

671
00:51:21,583 --> 00:51:22,750
Leave!

672
00:51:28,291 --> 00:51:29,583
One last thing.

673
00:51:30,666 --> 00:51:32,458
Your column in the newspaper.

674
00:51:32,958 --> 00:51:35,791
Do people really ask these questions,
or you just make them up for fun?

675
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:39,333
Prabha!

676
00:51:39,625 --> 00:51:40,875
I'm leaving, I'm leaving.

677
00:51:43,375 --> 00:51:44,250
Jagdesh!

678
00:51:45,625 --> 00:51:47,916
<span style="style.center_1">Mr. Vardhi's book made</span>
<span style="style.center_1">one thing very clear.</span>

679
00:51:48,583 --> 00:51:51,666
<span style="style.center_1">Our country lies in darkness</span>
<span style="style.center_1">when it comes to sex education.</span>

680
00:51:52,333 --> 00:51:56,333
<span style="style.center_1">And only people like Dr. Vardhi</span>
<span style="style.center_1">can guide us.</span>

681
00:52:00,916 --> 00:52:01,791
Sir!

682
00:52:02,333 --> 00:52:03,500
What are you doing here?

683
00:52:06,916 --> 00:52:08,083
Do you come here every day?

684
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:09,500
I come here every day.

685
00:52:09,583 --> 00:52:11,083
This is the first time
I am seeing you here.

686
00:52:11,166 --> 00:52:13,125
I jog on the other side every day.

687
00:52:13,208 --> 00:52:14,875
-You jog?
-Yes, five miles.

688
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,375
-In slippers?
-Sports slippers.

689
00:52:17,458 --> 00:52:18,458
Hi, Prabha! How are you?

690
00:52:18,541 --> 00:52:20,083
Ignore him, Prabha.

691
00:52:20,333 --> 00:52:21,708
Stay away...

692
00:52:21,791 --> 00:52:22,875
Stay away from her.

693
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:24,833
Kick him.

694
00:52:27,166 --> 00:52:29,375
-What happened?
-Can't get it started.

695
00:52:29,625 --> 00:52:30,833
Keep trying.

696
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,625
The carburetor must be clogged.

697
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:35,791
Can I drop you home?

698
00:52:37,291 --> 00:52:38,458
I have read your book.

699
00:52:38,916 --> 00:52:40,875
You are very honest and genuine.

700
00:52:40,958 --> 00:52:42,791
I have met 25 doctors

701
00:52:42,875 --> 00:52:45,541
19 hakims, 12 astrologists and
4 thugs in the past two months.

702
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,083
All of them were fake.

703
00:52:47,375 --> 00:52:48,666
They'll go to Khajuraho.

704
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:50,458
They'll secretively
read the Kamasutra.

705
00:52:51,291 --> 00:52:53,375
But they won't tell anyone
when they have a problem.

706
00:52:53,666 --> 00:52:56,250
The one who sells snacks
outside your clinic

707
00:52:56,416 --> 00:52:58,875
makes more than you made in 50 years.

708
00:52:59,541 --> 00:53:00,416
Do you know why?

709
00:53:00,875 --> 00:53:03,833
Because while all troubled husbands are
in your clinic waiting for their turn

710
00:53:03,916 --> 00:53:06,291
their wives eat
his snacks to kill time.

711
00:53:06,375 --> 00:53:08,000
I know your true worth.

712
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:09,666
You are precious.

713
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,500
Everyone,
this country, this world needs you.

714
00:53:12,791 --> 00:53:15,250
We need each other.

715
00:53:16,125 --> 00:53:18,291
You will benefit from our partnership.

716
00:53:18,833 --> 00:53:21,166
You'll be able to open two more
clinics like these in three months.

717
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:23,208
Three clinics?

718
00:53:30,208 --> 00:53:32,333
I don't want to see you
anywhere close to me again.

719
00:53:44,416 --> 00:53:45,958
They are sexologists?

720
00:53:46,041 --> 00:53:47,125
You bloody...

721
00:53:47,458 --> 00:53:51,458
Get him, Prabha! Get him!

722
00:53:51,541 --> 00:53:53,625
<span style="style.center_1">Is doing business a piece of cake?</span>

723
00:53:54,416 --> 00:53:55,458
<span style="style.center_1">Is it so easy?</span>

724
00:53:55,916 --> 00:53:57,666
<span style="style.center_1">Is it simple? Is it easy?</span>

725
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:58,833
Sit over there.

726
00:53:58,916 --> 00:54:01,166
<span style="style.center_1">If it was so easy, then</span>
<span style="style.center_1">anybody could have done it.</span>

727
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:04,500
<span style="style.center_1">You could have done it.</span>

728
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:09,583
What is this?

729
00:54:10,041 --> 00:54:11,833
You took all the money
out of the account?

730
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:13,375
Why?

731
00:54:14,041 --> 00:54:15,458
I am trying to start a business.

732
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:16,875
What business, Raghu?

733
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,500
Our carpet business is doing well.

734
00:54:18,583 --> 00:54:20,708
Oh, really?
What's our income?

735
00:54:23,916 --> 00:54:25,416
What are you doing, Raghu?

736
00:54:25,916 --> 00:54:27,791
Dev only pays his school fees.

737
00:54:27,875 --> 00:54:29,458
We have other expenses
to take care of.

738
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:31,541
-From where do I get the money?
-In front of Chintu...

739
00:54:32,208 --> 00:54:33,625
Chintu, just step outside.

740
00:54:33,708 --> 00:54:35,666
Chintu won't go anywhere.
Stay there, Chintu.

741
00:54:40,833 --> 00:54:43,125
-Rukmani, I...
-I am fed up of all this.

742
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:46,416
I am done, Raghu.

743
00:54:48,666 --> 00:54:50,750
I cannot keep borrowing money.

744
00:54:52,583 --> 00:54:54,125
This is my last warning.

745
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,208
I want to return this book.

746
00:55:25,375 --> 00:55:26,958
-It's rubbish.
-What happened, sir?

747
00:55:27,041 --> 00:55:29,333
-This man is useless.
-Who?

748
00:55:29,416 --> 00:55:30,666
Tribhuvan Vardhi.

749
00:55:31,458 --> 00:55:32,875
Jayraj, this is a library.

750
00:55:32,958 --> 00:55:34,000
Please maintain silence.

751
00:55:34,083 --> 00:55:36,166
Keep your voice down.
You are in a library.

752
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:37,833
I am not yelling.

753
00:55:38,083 --> 00:55:39,250
I am keeping my voice down.

754
00:55:40,666 --> 00:55:42,666
He studied in different parts of the
world. He gained a lot of knowledge.

755
00:55:42,875 --> 00:55:44,625
But what did he do with the knowledge?
What did he do?

756
00:55:46,291 --> 00:55:48,416
He used to apply his knowledge
in Uganda, but he was asked to leave.

757
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:50,750
He has opened up a small clinic here.

758
00:55:51,166 --> 00:55:52,583
He treats 20 patients every day.

759
00:55:53,541 --> 00:55:55,333
There are at least 2 million people
who need him.

760
00:55:56,791 --> 00:55:57,625
Pay attention.

761
00:55:57,708 --> 00:56:00,291
Someone wants to help him,
but he doesn't want to change.

762
00:56:04,208 --> 00:56:05,833
These people have a problem.

763
00:56:05,916 --> 00:56:07,000
They refuse to listen.

764
00:56:08,166 --> 00:56:10,333
This is not due to their
old age, but their ego.

765
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:15,083
It's not so.
He's well respected.

766
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:18,166
And what does this
respect get him, peanuts?

767
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:20,625
He's someone who doesn't
follow his own principles.

768
00:56:20,708 --> 00:56:22,291
Read what's written in here.

769
00:56:23,083 --> 00:56:24,125
Louder.

770
00:56:28,875 --> 00:56:29,833
Yes, share.

771
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:33,625
Knowledge is a form of wealth
that increases when shared.

772
00:56:33,958 --> 00:56:35,416
So it is important to share it.

773
00:56:37,458 --> 00:56:39,666
Look, I am a businessman.

774
00:56:40,583 --> 00:56:43,041
I took the book to get motivated.
I ended up getting depressed instead.

775
00:56:46,083 --> 00:56:48,458
I have a carpet shop
on the Ashram road.

776
00:56:48,541 --> 00:56:50,041
Do come, I'll give you a discount.

777
00:56:50,125 --> 00:56:51,916
-No, thanks.
-Please come.

778
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
I am not selfish.
I think about everyone.

779
00:56:54,333 --> 00:56:55,208
Public service.

780
00:57:13,458 --> 00:57:15,000
My phone number is on the card.

781
00:57:34,041 --> 00:57:38,083
<span style="style.center_1">If you didn't get anything from China,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">then what is in that soup?</span>

782
00:57:39,208 --> 00:57:41,416
Milk, cream and sugar.

783
00:57:47,625 --> 00:57:49,916
Raghu, you have got a parcel
from China. I've kept it inside.

784
00:57:57,583 --> 00:57:59,916
<span style="style.center_1">There is a secret behind</span>
<span style="style.center_1">every successful business.</span>

785
00:58:03,875 --> 00:58:09,250
<span style="style.center_1">This secret is worth millions</span>
<span style="style.center_1">only as long as it remains a secret.</span>

786
00:58:11,375 --> 00:58:17,333
THE NEXT CHAPTER...

787
00:58:29,333 --> 00:58:31,416
What's the update on
Zeng's autopsy, Sharma?

788
00:58:34,916 --> 00:58:36,625
No autopsy yet, sir.

789
00:58:37,291 --> 00:58:38,125
Why?

790
00:58:39,666 --> 00:58:43,166
Indian Government wants to
release the body only after an autopsy.

791
00:58:43,916 --> 00:58:46,166
The Chinese government wants
to do the autopsy in China.

792
00:58:47,166 --> 00:58:48,750
All the reports are on hold, sir.

793
00:58:48,833 --> 00:58:50,333
So we keep at it?

794
00:58:50,833 --> 00:58:53,000
We are screwed, sir.
Let's go.

795
00:58:54,708 --> 00:58:56,333
At least wash your hands.

796
00:58:56,416 --> 00:58:57,583
Oh, yeah.

797
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:12,916
What's wrong with you, sweetheart?

798
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,625
Start working, love.

799
00:59:15,708 --> 00:59:16,833
Hey! Sit down!

800
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:27,041
Chinese hunter Shambu
has been arrested.

801
00:59:27,875 --> 00:59:29,458
He has killed 63 tigers.

802
00:59:32,291 --> 00:59:33,625
He's wanted by the Interpol.

803
00:59:33,708 --> 00:59:35,125
Sir, I met him just once.

804
00:59:35,208 --> 00:59:36,541
I don't even know what he does.

805
00:59:36,708 --> 00:59:37,583
Oh, really?

806
00:59:38,958 --> 00:59:40,625
He had sent you a courier from China.

807
00:59:41,791 --> 00:59:42,916
This is your address, right?

808
00:59:44,916 --> 00:59:45,833
What was that?

809
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:49,291
-Courier?
-What was in that courier?

810
00:59:50,416 --> 00:59:52,041
This is all so fucked up!

811
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:53,166
What the hell, man!

812
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:58,666
A goat rear, an emu egg seller
meet a hunter who has killed 63 tigers,

813
00:59:58,750 --> 01:00:02,333
they get the tiger's penis here
and put it in their soup

814
01:00:02,416 --> 01:00:04,750
which ends up killing China's General.

815
01:00:04,958 --> 01:00:08,000
Sharma, even the irony is screwed here.

816
01:00:08,083 --> 01:00:10,125
They are screwing with us, sir.

817
01:00:10,916 --> 01:00:14,041
Tell me something, how can you pull
such stunts from Ahmadabad?

818
01:00:14,125 --> 01:00:15,125
Sharma.

819
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:18,375
They are businessmen.

820
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:22,416
They can do frauds anywhere
in the world, only to return here.

821
01:00:23,541 --> 01:00:28,000
We are the fools who waste
our lives giving competitive exams.

822
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:30,583
We keep wasting paper and pen.

823
01:00:32,583 --> 01:00:33,666
I've had enough of this!

824
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:34,750
Sir, I...

825
01:00:35,083 --> 01:00:39,541
Raghu, tell me the truth.
Or else, I'll torture the doctor.

826
01:00:40,625 --> 01:00:42,875
Sir, he doesn't know
anything about Hao Li.

827
01:00:42,958 --> 01:00:44,291
I didn't tell him anything.

828
01:00:44,541 --> 01:00:48,750
Tell us what you didn't tell him.

829
01:00:52,208 --> 01:00:54,000
This is a huge market,
30 billion's worth.

830
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:55,208
And completely unorganized.

831
01:00:56,166 --> 01:00:57,416
Right, disorganized.

832
01:00:57,666 --> 01:01:00,458
Sir, it is a huge market
but it is still virgin.

833
01:01:01,083 --> 01:01:02,833
Our soup will break its virginity.

834
01:01:03,416 --> 01:01:08,000
That's fine, Raghu,
but what about awareness?

835
01:01:09,041 --> 01:01:11,208
We will earn respect
only after there is awareness.

836
01:01:12,041 --> 01:01:13,416
Don't worry about that.

837
01:01:13,625 --> 01:01:15,041
I have already thought about it.

838
01:01:15,791 --> 01:01:16,958
Everything is in place.

839
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:19,125
Sit.

840
01:01:21,958 --> 01:01:25,625
What do you think, will my medicine work?

841
01:01:26,125 --> 01:01:27,583
You have a good plan.

842
01:01:28,625 --> 01:01:32,833
But your medicine will only
work for 70-80 percent people.

843
01:01:33,666 --> 01:01:36,375
I cannot give the guarantee
that it will work 100 percent.

844
01:01:38,916 --> 01:01:41,791
No one other than you can
understand it or prescribe it.

845
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:46,708
I know this is not right.

846
01:01:47,083 --> 01:01:52,750
Raghu, it doesn't make any difference.

847
01:01:52,916 --> 01:01:54,708
The only condition is
that it should work.

848
01:01:55,208 --> 01:01:57,833
Do you know the biggest problem of India?

849
01:02:01,208 --> 01:02:04,041
We think about sex when at work

850
01:02:04,583 --> 01:02:07,333
and we think about work during sex.

851
01:02:07,833 --> 01:02:12,666
That's the reason you don't
perform well at work and at night.

852
01:02:13,458 --> 01:02:14,625
You are so funny, sir.

853
01:02:15,833 --> 01:02:19,041
So, do we have a deal?

854
01:02:21,375 --> 01:02:25,000
Prabha, does he want a partnership,
or your hand in marriage?

855
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Please tell me.

856
01:02:31,791 --> 01:02:33,041
I promise.

857
01:02:35,125 --> 01:02:36,375
-Promise?
-Promise.

858
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:43,375
<span style="style.center_1">Awareness and business had joined hands.</span>

859
01:02:43,458 --> 01:02:45,916
<span style="style.center_1">Both thought this was a profitable deal.</span>

860
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:51,791
But Raghu, suddenly shifting from
Nepalese carpets to Chinese fans?

861
01:02:52,583 --> 01:02:54,250
Where did you get this idea from?

862
01:02:54,458 --> 01:02:56,375
I thought about it.

863
01:02:56,708 --> 01:02:58,416
Why didn't you tell me?

864
01:02:59,083 --> 01:03:00,041
Rukmani...

865
01:03:01,291 --> 01:03:03,375
you have tolerated
a lot in these ten years.

866
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,250
But our time is about to change now.

867
01:03:10,125 --> 01:03:14,208
Now China, Japan, and the whole
world will be a fan of Raghu's fan.

868
01:03:14,583 --> 01:03:15,791
The whole world.

869
01:03:24,625 --> 01:03:26,750
<span style="style.center_1">One brave move and I</span>
<span style="style.center_1">was all set to go for war.</span>

870
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:31,000
<span style="style.center_1">I have to gather my soldiers</span>
<span style="style.center_1">and prepare them for war.</span>

871
01:03:31,666 --> 01:03:32,750
<span style="style.center_1">Natu.</span>

872
01:03:33,125 --> 01:03:35,416
<span style="style.center_1">Our most trusted employee.</span>

873
01:03:35,916 --> 01:03:39,125
<span style="style.center_1">Though he was super slow at work,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">he was super-fast at calculations.</span>

874
01:03:39,208 --> 01:03:40,208
Are you crazy?

875
01:03:40,291 --> 01:03:41,666
What if Vithal finds out?

876
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:43,416
No one will find anything out.

877
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:44,666
Tell me, are you in?

878
01:03:46,833 --> 01:03:50,083
Ten times stronger than Viagra?

879
01:03:50,291 --> 01:03:51,500
I swear.

880
01:03:51,958 --> 01:03:54,083
So tell me, are you in?

881
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:57,958
Jagdesh.

882
01:03:59,541 --> 01:04:00,500
<span style="style.center_1">Rupa.</span>

883
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:02,291
<span style="style.center_1">Dr. Vardhi's receptionist.</span>

884
01:04:02,375 --> 01:04:04,458
<span style="style.center_1">Smart, educated, Rupali a.k.a. Rupa.</span>

885
01:04:04,541 --> 01:04:08,333
<span style="style.center_1">She has been working with Dr. Vardhi</span>
<span style="style.center_1">to support her family</span>

886
01:04:08,416 --> 01:04:10,041
<span style="style.center_1">after her divorce.</span>

887
01:04:10,416 --> 01:04:12,166
<span style="style.center_1">She was also a part-time model.</span>

888
01:04:12,791 --> 01:04:15,708
<span style="style.center_1">And she used to teach at a</span>
<span style="style.center_1">coaching class during the weekends.</span>

889
01:04:16,375 --> 01:04:17,750
What salary do you seek?

890
01:04:18,125 --> 01:04:19,625
I want partnership.

891
01:04:20,833 --> 01:04:21,958
-How much?
-25.

892
01:04:22,083 --> 01:04:22,916
-5.
-24.

893
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:23,916
6!

894
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,083
-Let's go, son.
-Let's meet in the middle at 12.

895
01:04:26,166 --> 01:04:27,250
12?

896
01:04:28,041 --> 01:04:31,583
<span style="style.center_1">Now I know why big companies</span>
<span style="style.center_1">hire women as CEOs.</span>

897
01:04:36,125 --> 01:04:37,166
<span style="style.center_1">Ravi.</span>

898
01:04:37,291 --> 01:04:39,041
<span style="style.center_1">Natu's son.</span>

899
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:43,291
<span style="style.center_1">He had nothing so far except</span>
<span style="style.center_1">making photocopies and Facebook memes.</span>

900
01:04:43,791 --> 01:04:47,791
<span style="style.center_1">Sometimes those who do nothing</span>
<span style="style.center_1">end up doing something big.</span>

901
01:04:47,875 --> 01:04:49,500
<span style="style.center_1">That's what Natu believed in.</span>

902
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:54,000
This place belongs to Dr. Vardhi?

903
01:04:55,041 --> 01:04:56,708
It was an old hospital.

904
01:04:56,791 --> 01:04:58,125
No one uses it anymore.

905
01:04:58,833 --> 01:05:00,375
This place seems haunted.

906
01:05:01,458 --> 01:05:03,125
What are you doing, Natu?

907
01:05:04,291 --> 01:05:05,250
<span style="style.center_1">Jagdesh.</span>

908
01:05:05,625 --> 01:05:07,375
<span style="style.center_1">I don't have a big introduction for him.</span>

909
01:05:07,458 --> 01:05:10,458
<span style="style.center_1">I got him free with Dr. Vardhi</span>
<span style="style.center_1">in the buy-one-get-one offer.</span>

910
01:05:15,083 --> 01:05:19,000
<span style="style.center_1">From Apple to Amazon and</span>
<span style="style.center_1">from HP to Harley Davidson.</span>

911
01:05:19,083 --> 01:05:21,166
<span style="style.center_1">All start-ups started in dingy places.</span>

912
01:05:21,625 --> 01:05:25,625
<span style="style.center_1">Dr. Vardhi's first floor</span>
<span style="style.center_1">was about to become our office.</span>

913
01:05:27,083 --> 01:05:28,041
Hey!

914
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:30,083
Sit down.

915
01:05:33,416 --> 01:05:34,250
So...

916
01:05:35,083 --> 01:05:39,083
According to Dr. Vardhi our product
will work in 80 percent of the cases.

917
01:05:39,166 --> 01:05:42,541
The 20 percent for
whom it doesn't work...

918
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:45,291
will indulge in negative publicity.

919
01:05:47,416 --> 01:05:50,541
A man always has a huge ego.
As huge as a football.

920
01:05:50,958 --> 01:05:53,541
Even if it doesn't work
they will never say it out aloud.

921
01:05:53,625 --> 01:05:55,041
They will never admit it.

922
01:05:55,291 --> 01:06:01,041
Yes, son, no man would accept
that he didn't perform well in bed.

923
01:06:04,708 --> 01:06:06,583
So, we will begin with manufacturing.

924
01:06:08,625 --> 01:06:12,083
The best place for manufacturing
was aunt Dhani's house.

925
01:06:12,375 --> 01:06:14,541
<span style="style.center_1">Neha, today we will</span>
<span style="style.center_1">make creamy cottage cheese.</span>

926
01:06:14,625 --> 01:06:17,541
<span style="style.center_1">Usually everyone likes it.</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Kids, elders.</span>

927
01:06:17,625 --> 01:06:18,500
Hello.

928
01:06:18,583 --> 01:06:21,041
<span style="style.center_1">Yes. It's my husband's favorite.</span>

929
01:06:21,125 --> 01:06:22,000
<span style="style.center_1">Really?</span>

930
01:06:22,958 --> 01:06:25,333
<span style="style.center_1">What does your husband do, Rashmi?</span>

931
01:06:25,625 --> 01:06:28,333
<span style="style.center_1">Well, my husband is</span>
<span style="style.center_1">a mechanical engineer.</span>

932
01:06:28,416 --> 01:06:31,291
<span style="style.center_1">He has to do most of his job standing.</span>

933
01:06:31,416 --> 01:06:33,458
<span style="style.center_1">So, he is quite tired</span>
<span style="style.center_1">by the time he reaches home.</span>

934
01:06:33,541 --> 01:06:36,625
<span style="style.center_1">-Obviously.</span>
<span style="style.center_1">-So this kind of a dish cheers him up.</span>

935
01:06:36,708 --> 01:06:37,875
Oh.

936
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:43,333
<span style="style.center_1">Keep stirring all the</span>
<span style="style.center_1">spices till the oil separates.</span>

937
01:06:44,833 --> 01:06:48,000
<span style="style.center_1">This smells amazing.</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Why don't you taste it?</span>

938
01:06:49,916 --> 01:06:52,041
<span style="style.center_1">-This is delicious, Rashmi.</span>
-Amazing.

939
01:06:55,916 --> 01:06:57,291
Our next step is packaging.

940
01:06:57,416 --> 01:07:00,416
With a good packaging you can
sell anything at the price of gold.

941
01:07:01,375 --> 01:07:03,208
Ravi, you will handle the packaging.

942
01:07:03,708 --> 01:07:05,208
Bruce Lee? Salman Khan?

943
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:08,041
Or Tiger Shroff?
He will be the best.

944
01:07:08,125 --> 01:07:09,416
We are not making a movie here.

945
01:07:09,625 --> 01:07:10,875
Just write "Magic Soup"

946
01:07:11,333 --> 01:07:13,541
and write something nice in Chinese.

947
01:07:13,625 --> 01:07:14,916
What should I write in Chinese?

948
01:07:16,541 --> 01:07:17,625
For zealous men.

949
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:19,708
That's great.

950
01:07:21,125 --> 01:07:21,958
Raghu!

951
01:07:23,333 --> 01:07:24,208
Raghu!

952
01:07:24,333 --> 01:07:25,208
Yes?

953
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:26,166
What is this?

954
01:07:27,541 --> 01:07:28,416
What is this?

955
01:07:29,791 --> 01:07:34,500
Oh yes, I had an upset stomach yesterday,
so Vithal gave me this mix.

956
01:07:34,583 --> 01:07:35,791
Are you feeling better now?

957
01:07:36,041 --> 01:07:38,083
Yes, I'm farting a lot
but everything else is...

958
01:07:38,541 --> 01:07:39,375
Raghu!

959
01:07:45,458 --> 01:07:47,208
Just 5?

960
01:07:47,291 --> 01:07:48,666
This is just a sample product.

961
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:54,166
We'll need money to produce it in large
quantity and distribute it in the market.

962
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:56,791
We need...

963
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:04,500
around 350,000 for manufacturing,
marketing and distribution.

964
01:08:14,791 --> 01:08:17,208
Bharat, it's the best
product in the market.

965
01:08:17,291 --> 01:08:19,041
I have brought it all the way from China.

966
01:08:19,750 --> 01:08:21,875
I need 700,000 from you.

967
01:08:22,041 --> 01:08:23,625
I will return it with interest.

968
01:08:25,416 --> 01:08:29,541
Didn't you come to me with an idea
of making a floor cleaner with cow urine?

969
01:08:30,208 --> 01:08:31,291
That was a long time ago.

970
01:08:31,375 --> 01:08:33,750
I didn't work on it
after you asked me not to.

971
01:08:38,541 --> 01:08:39,791
How about 350,000 then?

972
01:08:56,625 --> 01:08:57,583
So, Raghu...

973
01:08:58,041 --> 01:09:00,250
Raman told me everything about you.

974
01:09:01,208 --> 01:09:02,375
What's your scheme?

975
01:09:03,291 --> 01:09:04,916
Can we talk in your office?

976
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:06,916
Let's not talk in
front of these buffaloes.

977
01:09:07,416 --> 01:09:10,958
These buffaloes won't leak
your business plan to the CNN.

978
01:09:11,458 --> 01:09:12,500
You are right.

979
01:09:12,791 --> 01:09:14,458
How much money do you want?

980
01:09:14,541 --> 01:09:17,125
700,000 at 4% for 2 months.

981
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:24,541
At 4%?

982
01:09:25,041 --> 01:09:25,916
Take this.

983
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:29,916
I won't give it at less than 12%
even to my father.

984
01:09:30,041 --> 01:09:31,416
Dad? Daddy...

985
01:09:31,541 --> 01:09:32,625
Get lost.

986
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,125
Waste of time!

987
01:09:35,458 --> 01:09:37,458
Can I have a moment of your time?

988
01:09:37,708 --> 01:09:38,541
Yes.

989
01:09:39,041 --> 01:09:41,083
I have a medicine.

990
01:09:41,291 --> 01:09:42,125
Okay.

991
01:09:42,208 --> 01:09:45,000
You know there are
some men who face weakness?

992
01:09:45,541 --> 01:09:50,625
They want to perform well, but
when they need to perform, they can't?

993
01:09:51,416 --> 01:09:52,833
Also, for those who can...

994
01:09:54,291 --> 01:09:55,375
This is the best medicine.

995
01:09:55,791 --> 01:09:59,208
It will take Gujarat... Not just Gujarat,
the whole of India by storm.

996
01:09:59,750 --> 01:10:01,541
There is no product
like this in the market.

997
01:10:01,625 --> 01:10:02,750
Trust me.

998
01:10:16,833 --> 01:10:17,708
Come here.

999
01:10:19,833 --> 01:10:21,916
You will get the funding
by day after tomorrow, okay?

1000
01:10:27,625 --> 01:10:28,916
Mix it in water and have it.

1001
01:10:51,041 --> 01:10:52,541
<span style="style.center_1">Population of Ahmadabad: 8 million.</span>

1002
01:10:52,625 --> 01:10:54,041
<span style="style.center_1">Population of Gujarat: 65 million.</span>

1003
01:10:54,125 --> 01:10:55,250
There must be hundreds of
thousands unsatisfied couples

1004
01:10:55,333 --> 01:10:56,500
among these 65 million.

1005
01:10:56,583 --> 01:10:59,166
If we manage to get our product
to even 5% of these people

1006
01:11:00,125 --> 01:11:01,750
then our sales will be in millions.

1007
01:11:02,458 --> 01:11:06,583
<span style="style.center_1">Rupa, you'll get the patients' list</span>
<span style="style.center_1">from all local clinics</span>

1008
01:11:06,666 --> 01:11:09,416
<span style="style.center_1">hospitals, IVFs and gynecologists.</span>

1009
01:11:23,041 --> 01:11:24,250
Do you know what it means?

1010
01:11:24,333 --> 01:11:25,458
-Yes.
-Explain.

1011
01:11:26,833 --> 01:11:29,375
-How do I?
-Okay, I can understand.

1012
01:11:31,625 --> 01:11:33,208
Don't miss any parking lots.

1013
01:11:33,291 --> 01:11:36,708
And make sure our soup reaches
the mothers waiting outside the school.

1014
01:11:47,125 --> 01:11:48,416
Did you understand?

1015
01:11:49,333 --> 01:11:52,375
I am your father.

1016
01:11:52,791 --> 01:11:56,000
You came into this world because of me.

1017
01:11:58,875 --> 01:11:59,916
Did you understand?

1018
01:12:00,250 --> 01:12:02,041
Don't act smart.
Go.

1019
01:12:02,208 --> 01:12:05,583
From 150 clinics we
got data of 800 patients.

1020
01:12:05,666 --> 01:12:08,041
You should send emails to all of them.

1021
01:12:08,833 --> 01:12:10,333
And a message on their phone as well.

1022
01:12:11,041 --> 01:12:11,875
Okay?

1023
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,583
We used to do it a lot
before we got married.

1024
01:12:15,666 --> 01:12:16,541
What?

1025
01:12:16,625 --> 01:12:17,875
Sex, obviously.

1026
01:12:18,166 --> 01:12:19,000
And now?

1027
01:12:19,083 --> 01:12:21,833
And now that we are married,
he doesn't feel like doing it.

1028
01:12:22,291 --> 01:12:24,125
It happens.
It happens with everyone.

1029
01:12:24,250 --> 01:12:26,166
Okay, but is there a solution?

1030
01:12:26,666 --> 01:12:29,458
Give him this soup and start singing.

1031
01:12:33,375 --> 01:12:39,291
My little dude is too little.

1032
01:12:39,416 --> 01:12:42,041
He wants to be hulk, doctor.

1033
01:12:42,125 --> 01:12:45,000
Size doesn't matter.
Performance does.

1034
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:50,583
If you want to be hulk,
then stay away from stress.

1035
01:12:50,916 --> 01:12:52,625
Do I eat it or rub it?

1036
01:12:52,958 --> 01:12:55,416
First, you pop this then you pop it.

1037
01:13:00,458 --> 01:13:03,291
It will stop working, son.

1038
01:13:06,208 --> 01:13:08,250
Grandpa, Raghu is here.

1039
01:13:08,625 --> 01:13:10,500
Raghu! Come here!

1040
01:13:10,958 --> 01:13:14,291
Welcome, Carpet King.

1041
01:13:14,875 --> 01:13:15,875
Have a seat.

1042
01:13:17,916 --> 01:13:20,625
What do you keep doing till this hour?

1043
01:13:20,916 --> 01:13:23,250
Uncle, he works really hard these days.

1044
01:13:23,333 --> 01:13:26,125
He keeps video conferencing with
international clients all night long.

1045
01:13:26,208 --> 01:13:27,250
-Oh.
-Really?

1046
01:13:27,416 --> 01:13:28,916
What business has he started now?

1047
01:13:29,250 --> 01:13:30,625
Chinese fans.

1048
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:32,666
Chinese fans?

1049
01:13:33,041 --> 01:13:34,000
Chinese fan.

1050
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:38,208
Do you import them or export them?

1051
01:13:38,583 --> 01:13:39,541
Export.

1052
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:41,333
I see.

1053
01:13:42,458 --> 01:13:43,458
Where do you get it from?

1054
01:13:46,041 --> 01:13:51,416
I get them from the same guy
I get the carpets from, in Nepal.

1055
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:52,833
Then I export them.

1056
01:13:53,625 --> 01:13:54,500
Where?

1057
01:13:55,458 --> 01:13:57,250
Obviously to China.

1058
01:13:58,500 --> 01:13:59,708
Where in China?

1059
01:14:01,458 --> 01:14:05,541
Guangzhou,
Macau, Foshan, Shenzen, Pattaya.

1060
01:14:06,041 --> 01:14:06,916
Pattaya?

1061
01:14:07,625 --> 01:14:08,583
Great.

1062
01:14:08,666 --> 01:14:09,583
Wonderful.

1063
01:14:10,208 --> 01:14:12,208
Who is your distributor in Guangzhou?

1064
01:14:12,833 --> 01:14:13,708
Hao Li.

1065
01:14:14,541 --> 01:14:15,625
-Hao Li?
-Yes.

1066
01:14:16,208 --> 01:14:17,208
Which company?

1067
01:14:19,833 --> 01:14:21,875
How many tonnes do you send?

1068
01:14:22,666 --> 01:14:23,791
3-4 tonnes?

1069
01:14:23,875 --> 01:14:25,666
3-4 tonnes of fans?

1070
01:14:27,041 --> 01:14:28,458
China is a big country.

1071
01:14:28,541 --> 01:14:31,125
Looks like your fans
will cause the next tsunami.

1072
01:14:33,291 --> 01:14:36,166
My product is so powerful that
it is guaranteed to cause a tsunami.

1073
01:14:37,291 --> 01:14:40,083
Tiger Exporter is a seafood company.

1074
01:14:40,583 --> 01:14:41,666
What?

1075
01:14:46,250 --> 01:14:47,791
This is some other company.

1076
01:14:47,875 --> 01:14:50,458
That company is new,
so it still doesn't have a website.

1077
01:14:51,083 --> 01:14:51,958
Okay.

1078
01:14:53,458 --> 01:14:54,750
What's the turnover?

1079
01:14:55,708 --> 01:14:56,583
The margin is...

1080
01:14:56,666 --> 01:14:59,208
You guys are always
talking about business.

1081
01:14:59,375 --> 01:15:00,916
I'll go and get some
ice cream for everyone.

1082
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,375
Yes, let's eat ice cream.

1083
01:15:02,875 --> 01:15:05,416
-Sir...
-Our Carpet King!

1084
01:15:05,791 --> 01:15:08,458
You can try your luck at this as well.
And be a Fan King.

1085
01:15:09,666 --> 01:15:15,000
These small businesses sometimes
make people mill-owners.

1086
01:15:15,458 --> 01:15:17,708
-Mill-owner?
-Millionaires.

1087
01:15:17,791 --> 01:15:21,083
Bhide's nephew
became a millionaire

1088
01:15:21,166 --> 01:15:23,875
by selling zips for pants.

1089
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:27,708
He makes strong zips.
Pants fall out but the zip doesn't.

1090
01:15:48,458 --> 01:15:50,250
Yes, I'll meet you tomorrow.
No problem.

1091
01:15:50,708 --> 01:15:51,791
We'll go for coffee.

1092
01:15:51,875 --> 01:15:53,250
I'll call you back.

1093
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:55,333
Raghu, no progress.

1094
01:15:55,875 --> 01:15:57,541
I think all men have become superman.

1095
01:15:57,625 --> 01:15:59,416
No one needs it anymore.

1096
01:16:04,666 --> 01:16:05,625
Is this a joke?

1097
01:16:08,250 --> 01:16:09,333
Is this a joke?

1098
01:16:09,416 --> 01:16:11,083
No, Raghu.

1099
01:16:13,166 --> 01:16:14,833
Sorry...

1100
01:16:17,041 --> 01:16:19,375
<span style="style.center_1">You thought you are special?</span>

1101
01:16:19,875 --> 01:16:20,708
<span style="style.center_1">One in a million?</span>

1102
01:16:22,375 --> 01:16:25,625
<span style="style.center_1">Even if you are,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">there are 12,000 more like you in India.</span>

1103
01:16:26,541 --> 01:16:27,791
<span style="style.center_1">It's quite common.</span>

1104
01:16:30,083 --> 01:16:31,625
<span style="style.center_1">You guys are common.</span>

1105
01:16:34,708 --> 01:16:35,958
Don't worry.

1106
01:16:36,208 --> 01:16:38,500
It takes time for the
new business to setup.

1107
01:16:38,666 --> 01:16:41,125
You told your wife about the business?

1108
01:16:42,458 --> 01:16:43,750
Not yet.

1109
01:16:43,833 --> 01:16:45,291
-Tell her.
-I will.

1110
01:16:45,583 --> 01:16:47,291
I'll tell her in some time.

1111
01:16:47,375 --> 01:16:48,541
She'll get shocked otherwise.

1112
01:16:48,625 --> 01:16:50,458
-You are scared of her?
-No, I am not.

1113
01:16:52,416 --> 01:16:53,958
I'll tell her when the time is right.

1114
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:11,041
Tanmay?

1115
01:17:12,375 --> 01:17:13,250
Raghu.

1116
01:17:14,041 --> 01:17:15,000
China?

1117
01:17:15,291 --> 01:17:16,166
<span style="style.center_1">Thepla.</span>

1118
01:17:16,791 --> 01:17:17,750
From Ahmadabad?

1119
01:17:23,750 --> 01:17:24,916
How did you like the idea?

1120
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,458
Do you think this product will sell?

1121
01:17:26,541 --> 01:17:27,833
Why are you asking me?

1122
01:17:28,583 --> 01:17:30,958
Well, you have experience.

1123
01:17:31,416 --> 01:17:33,916
Who said you need
experience to do business?

1124
01:17:34,416 --> 01:17:35,333
Then?

1125
01:17:36,125 --> 01:17:38,166
You need balls of steel.

1126
01:17:38,875 --> 01:17:40,291
Balls of steel?

1127
01:17:46,541 --> 01:17:47,416
Look.

1128
01:17:48,541 --> 01:17:51,875
75% of our body is water.

1129
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:54,125
71% of earth is water.

1130
01:17:54,458 --> 01:17:58,291
This water has been freely
available since 4.5 billion years.

1131
01:17:59,375 --> 01:18:02,875
Then one day comes a smart guy

1132
01:18:03,541 --> 01:18:09,166
who bottles this free
water and sells it for 20 rupees.

1133
01:18:09,541 --> 01:18:12,041
And some chumps purchase it.

1134
01:18:14,333 --> 01:18:16,458
If you know how to sell,
then you can sell anything.

1135
01:18:19,333 --> 01:18:21,416
-How's this idea?
-It's good.

1136
01:18:21,958 --> 01:18:23,500
Your idea is a bomb, it will explode.

1137
01:18:26,916 --> 01:18:28,458
You're selling the wrong thing.

1138
01:18:29,791 --> 01:18:30,666
What?

1139
01:18:31,250 --> 01:18:33,750
Soup is your product
and you are selling the soup.

1140
01:18:34,083 --> 01:18:35,833
Doesn't the customer need the product?

1141
01:18:36,041 --> 01:18:38,500
The customer doesn't know shit.

1142
01:18:39,583 --> 01:18:41,250
The customer is an...

1143
01:18:42,916 --> 01:18:45,041
The customer is an idiot.

1144
01:18:45,125 --> 01:18:47,416
You never sell the actual product.

1145
01:18:47,625 --> 01:18:48,458
Then?

1146
01:18:48,541 --> 01:18:50,833
The soup is your story

1147
01:18:51,250 --> 01:18:53,333
and Vardhi is your hero.

1148
01:18:54,541 --> 01:18:56,500
Sell the hero, not the story.

1149
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,250
He is the hero.

1150
01:19:04,125 --> 01:19:09,875
The customer's mind is like a
field filled with sugarcane.

1151
01:19:09,958 --> 01:19:12,666
Each sugarcane is a product.

1152
01:19:13,166 --> 01:19:15,291
His mind is filled with products.

1153
01:19:15,833 --> 01:19:17,208
But a brand...

1154
01:19:17,458 --> 01:19:18,958
What is a brand?

1155
01:19:19,583 --> 01:19:20,500
What is it?

1156
01:19:20,583 --> 01:19:22,666
Brand is like a wild bull.

1157
01:19:23,416 --> 01:19:24,333
A wild bull.

1158
01:19:24,583 --> 01:19:25,833
A wild bull.

1159
01:19:26,791 --> 01:19:30,625
This wild bull enters the field,
crushes all sugarcane

1160
01:19:30,708 --> 01:19:33,875
and makes a place for itself.

1161
01:19:35,875 --> 01:19:37,500
Make Vardhi your brand.

1162
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:41,791
A 70-year-old rock star sexologist!

1163
01:19:45,291 --> 01:19:46,416
Try to sell him.

1164
01:19:46,916 --> 01:19:49,250
If he sells, then I
will get you the funding.

1165
01:20:03,458 --> 01:20:06,083
People prefer privacy.

1166
01:20:06,166 --> 01:20:08,166
No one gathers the courage
to speak up in front of everyone.

1167
01:20:08,291 --> 01:20:10,791
Don't expect more than
a handful of people to show up.

1168
01:20:10,875 --> 01:20:11,833
Why are you being so negative?

1169
01:20:11,916 --> 01:20:13,000
I'll go outside and check if he is here.

1170
01:20:13,083 --> 01:20:13,916
I'm not being negative.

1171
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Calm down, Dr. Vardhi.

1172
01:20:15,083 --> 01:20:16,125
Yes, sir.

1173
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:17,666
-Doctor?
-Yes.

1174
01:20:17,750 --> 01:20:19,375
Great.
Here for the seminar?

1175
01:20:19,666 --> 01:20:21,000
-Yes.
-Thank God you are here.

1176
01:20:21,083 --> 01:20:23,416
-This way please, sir.
-Come on.

1177
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:28,125
This year our primary school has arranged
this seminar especially for the parents.

1178
01:20:28,375 --> 01:20:33,458
You can ask any mental health
or stress related question pertaining

1179
01:20:33,541 --> 01:20:35,916
to your child directly to Dr. Mrunang.

1180
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,541
-It can be done using Google Pixel.
-Raghu!

1181
01:20:37,625 --> 01:20:38,958
Sir is going to the wrong place.

1182
01:20:39,416 --> 01:20:41,625
Sexologist's seminar
is taking place elsewhere.

1183
01:20:41,708 --> 01:20:42,666
Sir is such a...

1184
01:20:46,041 --> 01:20:49,125
<span style="style.center_1">A common man can</span>
<span style="style.center_1">be famous in only ways.</span>

1185
01:20:49,583 --> 01:20:51,875
<span style="style.center_1">Either by saying the wrong thing</span>
<span style="style.center_1">at the right place.</span>

1186
01:20:51,958 --> 01:20:55,083
<span style="style.center_1">Or by saying the right thing</span>
<span style="style.center_1">at the wrong place.</span>

1187
01:20:56,166 --> 01:20:58,333
Doctor is here with us now.

1188
01:21:10,041 --> 01:21:11,375
Hello, everyone.

1189
01:21:11,875 --> 01:21:14,166
I am happy and surprised as well.

1190
01:21:14,375 --> 01:21:16,625
I thought only a handful would show up.

1191
01:21:16,708 --> 01:21:18,958
But we have a packed auditorium instead.

1192
01:21:23,833 --> 01:21:26,708
So, without wasting any time,
let's take the first question.

1193
01:21:26,791 --> 01:21:27,791
Go ahead.

1194
01:21:28,083 --> 01:21:29,208
Yes, gentleman.

1195
01:21:29,750 --> 01:21:30,625
Come on.

1196
01:21:32,375 --> 01:21:36,333
Sir, my kid is never in the mood.

1197
01:21:36,416 --> 01:21:38,583
Never excited about anything.

1198
01:21:38,666 --> 01:21:41,083
He is not even interested in playing.

1199
01:21:41,166 --> 01:21:42,708
So does he have depression?

1200
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:46,750
What did you say?

1201
01:21:46,958 --> 01:21:48,041
My kid.

1202
01:21:48,125 --> 01:21:51,250
Okay.
Let's address this as a kid.

1203
01:21:52,291 --> 01:21:53,125
Okay?

1204
01:21:53,208 --> 01:21:57,000
You say that your "child"
is never in the "mood".

1205
01:21:57,625 --> 01:21:59,791
You will have to get him into the mood.

1206
01:22:00,375 --> 01:22:03,291
I believe that you should

1207
01:22:03,375 --> 01:22:06,750
encourage your "child" to play.

1208
01:22:06,833 --> 01:22:09,916
How will he get excited
if he doesn't play?

1209
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,875
Don't footballers and cricketers
do warm up before a game?

1210
01:22:13,958 --> 01:22:16,125
Only then do they
perform well in the game.

1211
01:22:18,083 --> 01:22:19,166
Understood?

1212
01:22:27,958 --> 01:22:31,333
Sir, my kid gets tired midway.

1213
01:22:31,416 --> 01:22:32,541
Is there a solution for that?

1214
01:22:32,625 --> 01:22:35,916
Stress levels are quite high in India.

1215
01:22:36,291 --> 01:22:38,958
There is work stress,
boss stress, too many to mention.

1216
01:22:39,041 --> 01:22:43,125
You are bound to get tired
midway if you bring that stress home.

1217
01:22:44,958 --> 01:22:47,708
So, it is important to stay stress-free.

1218
01:22:47,958 --> 01:22:51,583
You can reach orgasm only
if you remain stress-free.

1219
01:22:53,916 --> 01:22:55,625
He must have said organism, sir.

1220
01:22:56,916 --> 01:22:59,666
Sir, what can we do to
reduce the stress of exams?

1221
01:22:59,750 --> 01:23:03,958
First of all, intercourse is not an exam.

1222
01:23:05,833 --> 01:23:07,250
How can it be an exam?

1223
01:23:09,750 --> 01:23:11,791
He didn't say course.
He said intercourse.

1224
01:23:11,875 --> 01:23:14,125
Do you score your husband?

1225
01:23:14,208 --> 01:23:15,791
7 on 10? 8 on 10?

1226
01:23:17,166 --> 01:23:21,583
Let me tell you a secret,
he'll ace as soon

1227
01:23:21,666 --> 01:23:23,125
as you stop calling it an exam.

1228
01:23:27,416 --> 01:23:28,750
Sir, he is Dr. Vardhi.

1229
01:23:29,791 --> 01:23:31,541
His sex column features in the newspaper.

1230
01:23:38,541 --> 01:23:40,250
There is no misunderstanding.

1231
01:23:40,333 --> 01:23:42,541
Look how many people
have raised their hands.

1232
01:23:42,625 --> 01:23:44,416
Go and sit over there.
Go.

1233
01:23:44,583 --> 01:23:46,750
He seems to be unwell.

1234
01:23:47,333 --> 01:23:48,291
Yes, ma'am?

1235
01:23:48,791 --> 01:23:53,166
Sir, the bulb gets lit
but there's no light.

1236
01:23:58,750 --> 01:24:01,375
It's a metaphoric question.
Fine.

1237
01:24:01,458 --> 01:24:03,250
So I too will reply in a metaphor.

1238
01:24:03,333 --> 01:24:05,125
Men are like...

1239
01:24:05,625 --> 01:24:07,416
matchsticks.

1240
01:24:11,041 --> 01:24:11,958
They burn out.

1241
01:24:14,416 --> 01:24:19,625
And women are like steam irons.

1242
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:22,708
They take time to warm up.

1243
01:24:23,250 --> 01:24:26,750
So, men need to be a little patient.

1244
01:24:28,250 --> 01:24:33,333
If they are patient then
the bulb will glow brightly.

1245
01:24:37,750 --> 01:24:42,333
Doctor, don't you think we
shouldn't discuss this at such places?

1246
01:24:42,416 --> 01:24:43,583
Who was that?

1247
01:24:43,875 --> 01:24:46,541
Where else should we discuss it then?
This is the right forum.

1248
01:24:48,916 --> 01:24:53,375
We will teach a frog's anatomy

1249
01:24:53,458 --> 01:24:55,833
and reproductive system
in school.

1250
01:24:55,916 --> 01:24:58,458
But we won't teach about
human reproductive system.

1251
01:24:58,541 --> 01:25:00,416
Why?
It is important.

1252
01:25:00,958 --> 01:25:02,250
It is important to know.

1253
01:25:05,375 --> 01:25:06,875
They switched off the mic.

1254
01:25:06,958 --> 01:25:09,333
But that won't stop me.

1255
01:25:10,791 --> 01:25:12,833
We should discuss this.

1256
01:25:13,708 --> 01:25:15,625
A father and a son should discuss this.

1257
01:25:15,708 --> 01:25:17,458
A mother and a daughter
should discuss this.

1258
01:25:17,541 --> 01:25:19,208
A husband and a wife should discuss this.

1259
01:25:19,291 --> 01:25:20,416
Friends should discuss this.

1260
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:23,041
Talk openly and a lot of
your problems will get solved.

1261
01:25:50,958 --> 01:25:51,833
Sir!

1262
01:25:59,666 --> 01:26:01,333
<span style="style.center_1">A lot of your problems will get solved.</span>

1263
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,208
Jagdesh!

1264
01:26:18,833 --> 01:26:21,041
Raghu, we have so many patients.
Too many to handle.

1265
01:26:21,208 --> 01:26:22,291
He's having a tough time.

1266
01:26:22,916 --> 01:26:24,291
-My turn.
-Wait, wait, wait.

1267
01:26:24,375 --> 01:26:26,208
No more killing time by having snacks!

1268
01:26:40,750 --> 01:26:41,708
Jagdesh!

1269
01:26:51,375 --> 01:26:53,208
What do you want for
our anniversary this time?

1270
01:26:53,291 --> 01:26:54,541
Give me whatever you like.

1271
01:26:56,625 --> 01:26:57,500
Okay.

1272
01:27:02,375 --> 01:27:05,500
<span style="style.center_1">We were all hush-hush</span>
<span style="style.center_1">when we started this business.</span>

1273
01:27:06,375 --> 01:27:10,208
<span style="style.center_1">Finally, success came to us with a bang.</span>

1274
01:27:19,125 --> 01:27:20,458
RV International.

1275
01:27:23,916 --> 01:27:25,500
This is our soup's
new premium packaging.

1276
01:27:26,541 --> 01:27:27,416
Thank you.

1277
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:28,333
It is good.

1278
01:27:28,458 --> 01:27:29,541
Meet Myra and Kyra.

1279
01:27:30,166 --> 01:27:31,416
-Hi.
-Tanmay has sent them.

1280
01:27:31,583 --> 01:27:32,875
They are studying in America.

1281
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,208
What was the name of the university?

1282
01:27:35,291 --> 01:27:36,791
-Berkeley.
-Right.

1283
01:27:37,416 --> 01:27:40,708
Now we needed a new
foolproof delivery system

1284
01:27:41,416 --> 01:27:44,166
which could have our soup
delivered at home as soon as possible.

1285
01:27:50,583 --> 01:27:54,416
There are still many people
who feel shy to order our soup.

1286
01:27:54,958 --> 01:27:56,291
We have this number for them.

1287
01:27:58,541 --> 01:28:00,166
Type magic and send it to this number

1288
01:28:00,750 --> 01:28:03,125
and we will deliver
the soup wherever you want.

1289
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:06,500
Kyra and Myra, place this number
on all the social media accounts.

1290
01:28:08,875 --> 01:28:09,750
Everywhere.

1291
01:28:12,666 --> 01:28:17,166
Sir, I'll get piles if I keep
making deliveries on a scooter.

1292
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:21,041
Kahnudo, how many boys work for you?

1293
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,333
<span style="style.center_1">There is a 500-rupee margin</span>
<span style="style.center_1">on every liquor bottle.</span>

1294
01:28:34,333 --> 01:28:36,875
You will get a 500-rupee margin
on our soup.

1295
01:28:38,083 --> 01:28:41,583
Plus, the blessings from all the
unsatisfied wives who gain satisfaction.

1296
01:28:42,916 --> 01:28:43,875
What do you say, Ravi?

1297
01:28:43,958 --> 01:28:46,791
And no need to worry
about the police either.

1298
01:28:47,375 --> 01:28:50,833
So now, say no to liquor
and say yes to soup.

1299
01:28:57,750 --> 01:28:59,708
<span style="style.center_1">Our delivery system was foolproof.</span>

1300
01:28:59,875 --> 01:29:02,750
<span style="style.center_1">Both bootleggers and milkmen</span>
<span style="style.center_1">were selling the same thing.</span>

1301
01:29:02,833 --> 01:29:04,041
<span style="style.center_1">Our magic soup.</span>

1302
01:29:17,250 --> 01:29:18,083
<span style="style.center_1">On the other hand,</span>

1303
01:29:18,166 --> 01:29:22,166
<span style="style.center_1">Dr. Vardhi was spreading awareness from</span>
<span style="style.center_1">kitty parties to women's organizations.</span>

1304
01:29:34,416 --> 01:29:37,458
<span style="style.center_1">This country needed many</span>
<span style="style.center_1">more doctors like Dr. Vardhi.</span>

1305
01:29:39,166 --> 01:29:42,083
<span style="style.center_1">I wanted to make Dr. Vardhi</span>
<span style="style.center_1">a household name through the soup.</span>

1306
01:29:44,083 --> 01:29:47,625
<span style="style.center_1">A dream which Dr. Vardhi</span>
<span style="style.center_1">and I saw together.</span>

1307
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,750
We are here.
Park it right there.

1308
01:30:16,375 --> 01:30:17,291
Sir.

1309
01:30:23,750 --> 01:30:26,916
I get you alcohol every day and you
just realized you have to thank me?

1310
01:30:27,166 --> 01:30:28,791
Not for the alcohol.

1311
01:30:29,791 --> 01:30:31,291
Tanmay had called.

1312
01:30:31,375 --> 01:30:32,208
Really?

1313
01:30:32,541 --> 01:30:33,750
We will get the funding.

1314
01:30:40,250 --> 01:30:41,916
You rock, sir!

1315
01:30:44,125 --> 01:30:45,458
<span style="style.center_1">Look at these faces carefully.</span>

1316
01:30:46,666 --> 01:30:48,625
<span style="style.center_1">Look at their million-dollar smiles.</span>

1317
01:30:50,125 --> 01:30:54,208
Remember, it is not easy to do business.

1318
01:30:54,458 --> 01:30:58,541
It is like scuba diving in a sea of fire.

1319
01:31:05,250 --> 01:31:06,083
Duffers.

1320
01:31:06,166 --> 01:31:09,166
I wonder where they come from.
Their minds are full of shit.

1321
01:31:09,250 --> 01:31:11,583
-Tell me.
-What's with the sudden summons?

1322
01:31:12,166 --> 01:31:13,166
Is everything okay?

1323
01:31:14,666 --> 01:31:17,375
The irony is that I teach
business to the world

1324
01:31:17,458 --> 01:31:19,875
and my partner turned
out to be a cheater.

1325
01:31:19,958 --> 01:31:22,333
Mr. Mathur, please leave.
We'll do this later.

1326
01:31:27,208 --> 01:31:29,833
Which partner of yours
turned out to be a cheater?

1327
01:31:31,041 --> 01:31:33,166
I am talking about you!

1328
01:31:34,666 --> 01:31:35,625
No!

1329
01:31:36,875 --> 01:31:41,250
The Chinese who were going
to invest in our company...

1330
01:31:46,125 --> 01:31:47,375
I was relaxed.

1331
01:31:47,458 --> 01:31:48,708
I was calm.

1332
01:31:48,791 --> 01:31:51,375
Then, I said to myself,
"Where is the funding going?"

1333
01:31:51,458 --> 01:31:53,375
If it is not coming to us
then it has gone somewhere else.

1334
01:31:53,458 --> 01:31:54,583
So, I investigated.

1335
01:31:54,666 --> 01:31:58,291
There is a company in Ahmadabad,
RV International.

1336
01:31:58,625 --> 01:31:59,791
They sell this.

1337
01:32:05,375 --> 01:32:06,375
I have heard about it.

1338
01:32:06,458 --> 01:32:07,583
And what did you do about it?

1339
01:32:07,666 --> 01:32:09,000
This is an illegal product.

1340
01:32:09,208 --> 01:32:11,333
If I call the FDA,
they will ban it immediately.

1341
01:32:12,166 --> 01:32:15,833
Devraj, you have great connections.

1342
01:32:16,541 --> 01:32:17,541
That's great.

1343
01:32:17,833 --> 01:32:20,833
This is being sold at drug stores,
over the counter, right?

1344
01:32:21,333 --> 01:32:22,500
You will get it banned.

1345
01:32:23,916 --> 01:32:27,750
How will you ban a product that
is being sold in the underground market?

1346
01:32:28,250 --> 01:32:30,250
Damn it!

1347
01:32:30,666 --> 01:32:32,875
I was working hard for this deal
for two years.

1348
01:32:33,333 --> 01:32:34,541
I sent you to China for it.

1349
01:32:35,250 --> 01:32:36,708
But someone took it
right from under our noses.

1350
01:32:36,791 --> 01:32:37,666
What should I do now?

1351
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:41,541
Commit suicide.

1352
01:32:41,666 --> 01:32:42,583
What?

1353
01:32:43,583 --> 01:32:46,166
Find out about them.

1354
01:32:46,416 --> 01:32:48,333
Commit suicide.
I'll buy it.

1355
01:32:48,416 --> 01:32:50,291
How will you buy it?
They already have a funding.

1356
01:32:50,375 --> 01:32:52,458
That's not your headache,
you are about to commit suicide.

1357
01:32:52,625 --> 01:32:54,125
There's no use talking to you.

1358
01:32:54,208 --> 01:32:55,458
Call me after you calm down.

1359
01:32:55,541 --> 01:32:57,625
No one shows his back to Chopra!

1360
01:32:57,875 --> 01:32:59,583
Close the door!
Stop!

1361
01:33:01,833 --> 01:33:03,041
How dare he!

1362
01:33:03,416 --> 01:33:05,208
He couldn't tie the drawstrings right.

1363
01:33:05,291 --> 01:33:07,041
I taught him how to wear a suit.

1364
01:33:07,375 --> 01:33:09,666
Call for a cappuccino.

1365
01:33:10,208 --> 01:33:11,875
Why are you standing there?
Come here.

1366
01:33:14,375 --> 01:33:16,166
Why are you stinking?
Stay back.

1367
01:33:16,375 --> 01:33:17,541
Why don't you use a perfume?

1368
01:33:19,916 --> 01:33:22,291
-It's automatic.
-Amazing.

1369
01:33:22,833 --> 01:33:25,166
I hope your wife doesn't
get a heart attack.

1370
01:33:25,250 --> 01:33:27,000
This is the first time
I'm gifting her something.

1371
01:33:27,083 --> 01:33:29,125
-Is it locked from that side?
-I'll go and check.

1372
01:33:30,666 --> 01:33:32,541
Click a picture.
Here.

1373
01:33:35,666 --> 01:33:37,208
This is what is trending these days.

1374
01:33:44,958 --> 01:33:45,791
Open it, sir.

1375
01:33:47,166 --> 01:33:48,083
Here.

1376
01:33:49,416 --> 01:33:50,333
Money?

1377
01:33:55,041 --> 01:33:56,000
Hey!

1378
01:33:57,375 --> 01:33:58,208
Come here.

1379
01:33:58,875 --> 01:34:00,125
Oh, no.

1380
01:34:10,208 --> 01:34:14,500
<span style="style.center_1">Naughty vivid dreams</span>

1381
01:34:16,375 --> 01:34:20,208
<span style="style.center_1">Naughty are my desires</span>

1382
01:34:22,291 --> 01:34:26,041
<span style="style.center_1">Been dormant for so long</span>

1383
01:34:27,416 --> 01:34:30,791
<span style="style.center_1">Will come to life if you play along</span>

1384
01:34:31,541 --> 01:34:34,458
<span style="style.center_1">Sway, sway</span>

1385
01:34:34,583 --> 01:34:37,875
<span style="style.center_1">Sway, sway</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Sway throughout the night</span>

1386
01:34:44,458 --> 01:34:47,833
<span style="style.center_1">Sway, sway</span>

1387
01:34:47,916 --> 01:34:50,791
<span style="style.center_1">Sway, sway throughout the night</span>

1388
01:34:51,125 --> 01:34:54,083
<span style="style.center_1">Be mine</span>

1389
01:34:54,416 --> 01:34:57,375
<span style="style.center_1">Be my queen</span>

1390
01:34:58,250 --> 01:35:01,333
<span style="style.center_1">You saw me on my way to fill water</span>

1391
01:35:01,416 --> 01:35:04,541
<span style="style.center_1">On the moonlit full moon night</span>

1392
01:35:04,708 --> 01:35:07,875
<span style="style.center_1">You kept staring at me</span>
<span style="style.center_1">From two feet away</span>

1393
01:35:07,958 --> 01:35:11,125
<span style="style.center_1">You finally gathered courage</span>
<span style="style.center_1">To approach me this way</span>

1394
01:35:11,375 --> 01:35:14,375
<span style="style.center_1">I am a wearing a backless blouse</span>
<span style="style.center_1">And a sari</span>

1395
01:35:14,625 --> 01:35:17,666
<span style="style.center_1">My fans include Shah Rukh and Sallu</span>

1396
01:35:17,833 --> 01:35:20,916
<span style="style.center_1">Today is your chance to do some romance</span>

1397
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:24,041
<span style="style.center_1">Come to me, but approach with caution</span>

1398
01:35:36,750 --> 01:35:40,083
<span style="style.center_1">You are the reward</span>
<span style="style.center_1">To my past birth's merits</span>

1399
01:35:40,166 --> 01:35:43,291
<span style="style.center_1">The whole of Ahmadabad is jealous</span>

1400
01:35:43,375 --> 01:35:47,000
<span style="style.center_1">I am like a boring shirt</span>

1401
01:35:47,083 --> 01:35:50,208
<span style="style.center_1">You are like satin</span>

1402
01:35:50,791 --> 01:35:56,041
<span style="style.center_1">If I spend the night with you,</span>

1403
01:35:56,916 --> 01:36:01,666
<span style="style.center_1">It will cause a storm</span>

1404
01:36:02,583 --> 01:36:07,291
<span style="style.center_1">If you will approach me like this</span>

1405
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:13,125
<span style="style.center_1">It will cause a flood</span>
<span style="style.center_1">Which cannot be controlled</span>

1406
01:36:13,458 --> 01:36:16,666
<span style="style.center_1">Sway, sway</span>

1407
01:36:16,750 --> 01:36:19,791
<span style="style.center_1">Sway, sway throughout the night</span>

1408
01:36:19,875 --> 01:36:22,458
<span style="style.center_1">Be mine</span>

1409
01:36:22,916 --> 01:36:26,125
<span style="style.center_1">Be my queen</span>

1410
01:36:26,208 --> 01:36:32,166
<span style="style.center_1">Sway...</span>

1411
01:36:32,750 --> 01:36:38,708
<span style="style.center_1">Sway throughout the night</span>

1412
01:36:42,416 --> 01:36:44,541
What?

1413
01:36:45,041 --> 01:36:46,000
Hello.

1414
01:36:46,583 --> 01:36:47,416
Devraj.

1415
01:36:48,291 --> 01:36:49,208
Dr. Vardhi.

1416
01:36:49,291 --> 01:36:50,416
Rukmani.

1417
01:36:51,458 --> 01:36:52,666
Shall we begin?

1418
01:36:52,750 --> 01:36:57,875
Have you heard about
Fifty Shades of Grey?

1419
01:36:58,333 --> 01:36:59,333
Paint's shade card?

1420
01:36:59,583 --> 01:37:04,083
Actually, there's a
new product in the market.

1421
01:37:04,666 --> 01:37:07,333
All my friends have said
that it's quite effective.

1422
01:37:07,833 --> 01:37:09,875
I want you to try it.

1423
01:37:10,541 --> 01:37:12,208
But you said that
you reach the top floor.

1424
01:37:12,291 --> 01:37:13,666
We don't need it. Let's do it.

1425
01:37:13,750 --> 01:37:16,333
This takes one even higher.

1426
01:37:35,708 --> 01:37:37,125
-Hello?
<span style="style.center_1">-Where are you?</span>

1427
01:37:38,333 --> 01:37:39,166
At home.

1428
01:37:39,250 --> 01:37:42,125
How can you not be a part
of your success party?

1429
01:37:42,208 --> 01:37:43,500
Everyone is waiting for you.

1430
01:37:43,750 --> 01:37:45,541
<span style="style.center_1">Are you coming here,</span>
<span style="style.center_1">or should I come there?</span>

1431
01:37:45,625 --> 01:37:46,708
I am coming.

1432
01:37:49,583 --> 01:37:50,916
Is everything alright?

1433
01:37:51,125 --> 01:37:52,250
That was Devraj.

1434
01:37:53,125 --> 01:37:54,000
I'll need to go.

1435
01:38:00,416 --> 01:38:02,416
Welcome, Mr. Dream Merchant.

1436
01:38:03,291 --> 01:38:05,166
You are late.
The party is over.

1437
01:38:12,083 --> 01:38:13,708
By the way, great packaging.

1438
01:38:16,583 --> 01:38:18,750
Pot it and it shoots
you up like a rocket.

1439
01:38:20,916 --> 01:38:21,916
Catch.

1440
01:38:23,750 --> 01:38:24,708
Come with me.

1441
01:38:25,291 --> 01:38:26,125
Come with me.

1442
01:38:26,666 --> 01:38:29,000
-I'll be right back.
-Continue having fun, yeah?

1443
01:38:36,041 --> 01:38:37,458
You could have resorted to stealing.

1444
01:38:37,625 --> 01:38:39,375
You could have resorted
to robbing a bank.

1445
01:38:39,833 --> 01:38:41,583
You could have resorted to beg,
you moron.

1446
01:38:46,083 --> 01:38:48,791
From selling carpets to selling
stuff that make nights more fun.

1447
01:38:50,458 --> 01:38:52,875
You should have thought about
our family's reputation.

1448
01:38:55,125 --> 01:38:56,791
We are the trustees of Hatkesh temple.

1449
01:39:05,375 --> 01:39:06,333
Does she know?

1450
01:39:09,666 --> 01:39:12,708
Be at Chopra's office
tomorrow morning at nine.

1451
01:39:13,291 --> 01:39:14,333
Chopra?

1452
01:39:14,875 --> 01:39:15,708
Abhay Chopra.

1453
01:39:17,250 --> 01:39:18,208
Abhay Chopra!

1454
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:20,625
9 o'clock sharp.

1455
01:39:21,250 --> 01:39:22,583
I'll send you the address.

1456
01:39:24,125 --> 01:39:24,958
9 o'clock sharp.

1457
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:27,916
Bye.

1458
01:39:55,375 --> 01:39:57,583
I have watched all your videos.

1459
01:39:57,916 --> 01:39:58,958
I am a huge fan.

1460
01:40:00,541 --> 01:40:02,541
-Can I give you a hug, sir?
-Of course.

1461
01:40:06,541 --> 01:40:07,833
I've learnt a lot from you, sir.

1462
01:40:07,916 --> 01:40:08,875
Have a seat.

1463
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:14,916
Learning business by watching videos is
like learning swimming by reading a book.

1464
01:40:15,166 --> 01:40:16,000
Okay.

1465
01:40:16,083 --> 01:40:19,083
There is always the fear of drowning.

1466
01:40:20,666 --> 01:40:23,125
No, sir. I already had some.

1467
01:40:25,875 --> 01:40:30,750
I get hundreds of business
proposals every day.

1468
01:40:34,875 --> 01:40:39,166
Young bright kids, businessmen,
they all want to collaborate with me.

1469
01:40:39,250 --> 01:40:40,416
They all want to do business with me.

1470
01:40:44,291 --> 01:40:46,333
Ask me who do I wish to work with.

1471
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,833
-Who?
-With Rocket!

1472
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:54,041
Because there is a
fire behind every rocket.

1473
01:40:54,458 --> 01:40:57,958
Raghuveer Mehta,
there's a fire behind you.

1474
01:41:05,416 --> 01:41:06,625
Now?

1475
01:41:09,458 --> 01:41:11,166
Don't feel shy.

1476
01:41:15,166 --> 01:41:16,333
It is warm, sir.

1477
01:41:31,083 --> 01:41:32,750
These Chinese are very smart people.

1478
01:41:32,833 --> 01:41:35,708
Very smart.
But very tricky people.

1479
01:41:39,333 --> 01:41:41,041
You cannot handle them alone.

1480
01:41:45,250 --> 01:41:46,791
Anyway, tell me something.

1481
01:41:48,833 --> 01:41:50,000
What is business?

1482
01:41:51,333 --> 01:41:52,750
Business is a game.

1483
01:41:52,958 --> 01:41:54,791
A game of football.

1484
01:41:54,875 --> 01:41:57,583
You are center midfield,
you move forward with the ball.

1485
01:41:57,666 --> 01:41:59,708
You go to the opposition.
You give it to the striker.

1486
01:41:59,791 --> 01:42:00,750
And striker hits the goal!

1487
01:42:00,833 --> 01:42:02,708
Because it's always the
striker who hits the goal.

1488
01:42:02,791 --> 01:42:03,916
Messi does it.

1489
01:42:06,708 --> 01:42:08,083
I am your Messi.

1490
01:42:10,333 --> 01:42:15,041
You came so far just
by watching my videos.

1491
01:42:15,458 --> 01:42:19,375
Imagine how far you
will go if you work with me.

1492
01:42:23,416 --> 01:42:27,000
We'll sell this soup
in every corner of the world.

1493
01:42:28,208 --> 01:42:29,125
Think big.

1494
01:42:29,666 --> 01:42:30,583
Big.

1495
01:42:35,125 --> 01:42:36,000
Excuse me, sir.

1496
01:42:36,083 --> 01:42:37,791
Hold on...

1497
01:42:39,208 --> 01:42:40,208
What is it?

1498
01:42:44,625 --> 01:42:45,625
Okay, I'm coming.

1499
01:42:56,541 --> 01:42:57,375
Good poster.

1500
01:43:00,416 --> 01:43:02,625
I knew you would take the right decision.

1501
01:43:03,625 --> 01:43:04,500
No, sir.

1502
01:43:05,583 --> 01:43:07,083
You didn't understand my game.

1503
01:43:08,333 --> 01:43:09,375
It's a different game.

1504
01:43:10,458 --> 01:43:13,291
In my game, you just need to
stay off the field and do the commentary.

1505
01:43:13,541 --> 01:43:14,791
You cannot play.

1506
01:43:15,208 --> 01:43:16,208
I'll handle that.

1507
01:43:17,791 --> 01:43:19,375
It's you who has taught me this, sir

1508
01:43:20,208 --> 01:43:23,083
Dreams are not like junk food.

1509
01:43:23,375 --> 01:43:24,541
Don't undervalue them.

1510
01:43:25,625 --> 01:43:29,041
Sir, I won't undervalue my dream.

1511
01:43:31,500 --> 01:43:33,041
Moreover, I don't play football.

1512
01:43:33,166 --> 01:43:35,041
If you ever wish to
play cricket do let me know.

1513
01:43:35,125 --> 01:43:36,250
I love to hit sixes.

1514
01:43:39,083 --> 01:43:41,125
Raghu!
Devraj's brother!

1515
01:43:41,416 --> 01:43:42,708
I'll ruin you.

1516
01:43:42,791 --> 01:43:44,333
I am Abhay Chopra!

1517
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:46,458
What the hell is this?

1518
01:43:46,541 --> 01:43:47,875
Don't ever give it to me again!

1519
01:43:48,458 --> 01:43:49,916
I just want some normal tea!

1520
01:44:08,041 --> 01:44:08,875
What happened?

1521
01:44:37,208 --> 01:44:39,375
We found this in your son's school bag.

1522
01:44:40,166 --> 01:44:43,250
For the past two days, he is making
his classmates have it during recess.

1523
01:44:44,833 --> 01:44:46,333
-Chintu!
-It's just porridge, Dad.

1524
01:44:46,416 --> 01:44:48,333
I got it from Aunt Dhani's place.

1525
01:44:50,958 --> 01:44:52,333
He thought it was porridge, madam.

1526
01:44:52,416 --> 01:44:53,250
He doesn't know.

1527
01:44:55,250 --> 01:44:56,583
You are right.

1528
01:44:56,875 --> 01:44:57,958
He got confused.

1529
01:45:03,416 --> 01:45:05,666
You are right.
He'll apologize.

1530
01:45:05,750 --> 01:45:07,250
Chintu, apologize.

1531
01:45:08,041 --> 01:45:08,916
Apologize!

1532
01:45:12,250 --> 01:45:14,500
I'll apologize on his behalf.

1533
01:45:24,833 --> 01:45:26,375
I apologize.
I apologize to everyone.

1534
01:45:28,041 --> 01:45:28,916
Rukmani!

1535
01:45:29,500 --> 01:45:30,791
He's just a kid, he made a mistake.

1536
01:45:30,875 --> 01:45:32,916
This is his first mistake.

1537
01:45:33,375 --> 01:45:34,416
Rukmani...

1538
01:45:37,125 --> 01:45:38,750
What have you done?
Let me go!

1539
01:45:59,916 --> 01:46:01,000
Yes, Uncle?

1540
01:46:01,166 --> 01:46:02,333
Hello? Listen.

1541
01:46:02,666 --> 01:46:06,375
Do you know anything about this
new business that Raghu has started?

1542
01:46:07,208 --> 01:46:11,458
That idiot should have thought
twice before starting such a business.

1543
01:46:11,625 --> 01:46:12,708
He is a part of the Mehta family.

1544
01:46:12,791 --> 01:46:14,625
This is our personal matter.

1545
01:46:16,375 --> 01:46:17,916
We will handle it.

1546
01:46:18,833 --> 01:46:19,833
Right.

1547
01:46:20,291 --> 01:46:24,666
Look, you might not have a problem,
but I have a big problem with it.

1548
01:46:24,958 --> 01:46:26,208
Do let Raghu know.

1549
01:46:26,291 --> 01:46:30,666
He should never use Mehta
family's name ever again.

1550
01:46:32,208 --> 01:46:33,541
Okay?
Bye.

1551
01:46:55,583 --> 01:46:56,666
What is this?

1552
01:47:05,708 --> 01:47:08,750
Rukmani, I was going to tell you.

1553
01:47:08,916 --> 01:47:10,541
What were you going to tell me?

1554
01:47:14,916 --> 01:47:15,958
Listen to me.

1555
01:47:19,708 --> 01:47:21,875
You don't have a problem
with your friends purchasing it.

1556
01:47:24,291 --> 01:47:26,000
You don't have a problem
with you using it.

1557
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:28,208
You don't have a problem
with the world using it.

1558
01:47:28,291 --> 01:47:29,625
But you have a problem
with me selling it.

1559
01:47:30,291 --> 01:47:31,541
That is not fair, Rukmani.

1560
01:47:35,583 --> 01:47:39,125
You know there are so many men out there
who don't talk about their weakness.

1561
01:47:40,041 --> 01:47:42,250
What is wrong in it
if my medicine helps them?

1562
01:47:45,833 --> 01:47:48,041
How many business ideas of yours failed?

1563
01:47:49,458 --> 01:47:51,375
We had nearly zero income.

1564
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:54,750
Did I ever complain?

1565
01:47:58,375 --> 01:48:02,625
I just wanted people to respect you.

1566
01:48:03,458 --> 01:48:05,958
I wanted our relatives to respect you.

1567
01:48:06,333 --> 01:48:07,208
Rukmani.

1568
01:48:07,625 --> 01:48:10,458
I can no longer respect you anymore!

1569
01:48:10,541 --> 01:48:12,083
Don't say that, Rukmani.

1570
01:48:12,166 --> 01:48:13,250
Why did you do this?

1571
01:48:13,333 --> 01:48:15,416
I'm sorry, I made a mistake.

1572
01:48:16,083 --> 01:48:19,041
Why did you lie to me?
Why did you lie!

1573
01:48:19,125 --> 01:48:20,541
I'm sorry, I made a mistake.

1574
01:48:20,625 --> 01:48:21,750
I've had enough of your lies.

1575
01:48:21,833 --> 01:48:23,541
I didn't lie.
Rukmani!

1576
01:48:23,625 --> 01:48:25,541
Rukmani, please hear me out.

1577
01:49:10,041 --> 01:49:11,875
Everyone trusted me.

1578
01:49:14,708 --> 01:49:16,291
I broke everyone's trust.

1579
01:49:16,375 --> 01:49:18,541
No, no, no. Don't say that.

1580
01:49:18,625 --> 01:49:20,708
You cannot break anyone's trust.

1581
01:49:21,541 --> 01:49:22,708
Do you understand?

1582
01:49:23,166 --> 01:49:26,208
This business, funding, advertisement.

1583
01:49:26,416 --> 01:49:27,875
I don't want it.

1584
01:49:28,375 --> 01:49:30,000
We should stop all this.

1585
01:49:30,083 --> 01:49:33,291
-This is wrong.
-No. Calm down.

1586
01:49:33,375 --> 01:49:35,375
This is wrong.
We will work this out.

1587
01:49:35,458 --> 01:49:37,250
I don't want to!
This is wrong.

1588
01:49:37,333 --> 01:49:39,458
-We will work this out.
-I don't want to!

1589
01:49:40,375 --> 01:49:42,000
This is wrong.
We should stop all this.

1590
01:49:45,833 --> 01:49:46,916
This is wrong.

1591
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:51,208
Now all this is wrong?

1592
01:49:57,708 --> 01:49:59,041
Is this wrong?

1593
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:08,250
Look at me.

1594
01:50:09,666 --> 01:50:14,000
I made you leave when you
approached me for the first time.

1595
01:50:14,958 --> 01:50:16,000
But you came back.

1596
01:50:16,083 --> 01:50:17,625
I made you leave again.
You came back.

1597
01:50:17,708 --> 01:50:19,208
I made you leave again.
You came back.

1598
01:50:19,291 --> 01:50:21,708
That's when I thought
that this boy is special.

1599
01:50:21,791 --> 01:50:23,750
He will do something great.

1600
01:50:28,083 --> 01:50:29,041
But I was wrong.

1601
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:31,166
I was wrong.

1602
01:50:33,250 --> 01:50:37,583
I think you should stick
to selling your Nepalese carpets.

1603
01:50:52,875 --> 01:50:54,708
It is very easy for you to say this.

1604
01:50:56,291 --> 01:50:57,666
You live with a goat.

1605
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:00,916
I have a wife.

1606
01:51:54,833 --> 01:51:57,791
From the investigation,
they have learnt that

1607
01:51:57,875 --> 01:52:01,125
<span style="style.center_1">Chinese General Zeng died</span>
<span style="style.center_1">after consuming your soup.</span>

1608
01:52:01,875 --> 01:52:02,750
My soup?

1609
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,500
Turn this crisis into
an opportunity and score.

1610
01:52:14,833 --> 01:52:15,750
Tanmay?

1611
01:52:28,083 --> 01:52:29,916
Please tell us sir.

1612
01:52:30,125 --> 01:52:32,166
No one is going to believe this story.

1613
01:52:32,416 --> 01:52:33,666
You are ready to confess.

1614
01:52:33,750 --> 01:52:34,666
Now what happens depends on...

1615
01:52:34,750 --> 01:52:38,375
Friends, we have been ordered
to stop this investigation.

1616
01:52:39,958 --> 01:52:42,000
Government of India has 32 agencies.

1617
01:52:42,333 --> 01:52:46,125
They'll setup an inquiry commission
tomorrow to do preliminary inquiry.

1618
01:52:46,416 --> 01:52:47,875
It will consist of everyone
from the IT department

1619
01:52:47,958 --> 01:52:49,458
to the animal welfare organization.

1620
01:52:53,416 --> 01:52:54,666
This is the time to reconsider.

1621
01:52:55,583 --> 01:52:57,875
Tell us the truth,
what were you adding in that soup?

1622
01:52:57,958 --> 01:52:59,750
Otherwise,
you are about to get into big trouble.

1623
01:52:59,833 --> 01:53:00,666
Sharma.

1624
01:53:01,666 --> 01:53:03,875
This is a big mess.

1625
01:53:45,166 --> 01:53:48,875
We have representatives from
various services present here today.

1626
01:54:04,666 --> 01:54:07,916
They don't have any direct
connection in General Zeng's death.

1627
01:54:15,500 --> 01:54:16,791
The magic soup

1628
01:54:16,875 --> 01:54:20,041
does have something to
do with General Zeng's death.

1629
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:30,000
To make and sell a self-claimed
miraculous magical soup

1630
01:54:30,375 --> 01:54:31,583
is illegal.

1631
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:36,208
Well...

1632
01:54:37,833 --> 01:54:40,708
But we weren't just selling the product,
we are trying to sell Doctor.

1633
01:54:40,791 --> 01:54:43,333
I mean, market him.

1634
01:54:44,208 --> 01:54:49,166
Mr. Raghuveer, were you mixing
a tiger's body parts in your soup?

1635
01:55:00,166 --> 01:55:03,583
Basically, he is saying, where's
the proof of a tiger's presence in it?

1636
01:55:05,291 --> 01:55:08,208
We found animal protein in your products.

1637
01:55:12,541 --> 01:55:14,458
There is animal protein
found in milk as well.

1638
01:55:14,541 --> 01:55:16,833
Then what were you
adding in your product?

1639
01:55:24,375 --> 01:55:26,375
So you are interested
in my soup's recipe?

1640
01:55:26,625 --> 01:55:27,833
Please, make it quick.

1641
01:55:29,208 --> 01:55:30,250
Fine, I'll tell you.

1642
01:55:36,916 --> 01:55:38,250
20 grams cardamom powder.

1643
01:55:39,875 --> 01:55:41,041
50 grams sugar.

1644
01:55:42,250 --> 01:55:43,958
Cashew, pistachio and walnut,
50 grams each.

1645
01:55:44,041 --> 01:55:45,250
Finely crushed.

1646
01:55:45,416 --> 01:55:46,750
And 200 grams milk powder.

1647
01:55:49,958 --> 01:55:50,875
And?

1648
01:55:51,375 --> 01:55:52,333
And what?

1649
01:55:53,958 --> 01:55:56,583
You know what it turns into
after you add hot water to it?

1650
01:56:00,041 --> 01:56:00,916
Milk based dessert.

1651
01:56:08,541 --> 01:56:11,250
This is what we mix in hot
water and give to our patients.

1652
01:56:14,375 --> 01:56:16,250
What type of food is it?

1653
01:56:16,333 --> 01:56:17,833
What nonsense!

1654
01:56:20,041 --> 01:56:23,291
No... China, sir.
It's a sweet. Dessert.

1655
01:56:25,375 --> 01:56:30,833
So, are you telling us that
all these people got cured with that?

1656
01:56:30,916 --> 01:56:31,750
Yes.

1657
01:56:32,375 --> 01:56:34,375
What's it called? Placebo.
The placebo effect.

1658
01:56:40,083 --> 01:56:43,666
70% of the sex-related
problems are psychological.

1659
01:56:43,750 --> 01:56:44,833
They are only in the mind.

1660
01:56:44,916 --> 01:56:48,000
The patient thinks he is having a medicine
and that gives him confidence.

1661
01:56:48,208 --> 01:56:50,583
Thus, he enjoys sex thoroughly.
Simple.

1662
01:56:53,208 --> 01:56:55,208
I didn't curse anyone.

1663
01:56:57,125 --> 01:56:58,208
Okay!

1664
01:57:00,291 --> 01:57:02,166
You don't have a problem
with my language.

1665
01:57:02,250 --> 01:57:03,833
You have a problem with this word.

1666
01:57:05,208 --> 01:57:06,375
It's a simple word.

1667
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:08,833
It's normal.

1668
01:57:08,916 --> 01:57:13,333
But the method you chose to
make Mr. Vardhi famous, is wrong.

1669
01:57:13,708 --> 01:57:16,916
Dr. Vardhi gave vulgar
lectures at public forums.

1670
01:57:17,166 --> 01:57:18,333
That is illegal.

1671
01:57:18,500 --> 01:57:22,375
You were thrown out of
Uganda for the same reason.

1672
01:57:25,500 --> 01:57:30,125
Excuse me, sir, you aren't well.

1673
01:57:30,500 --> 01:57:31,375
Tonsils.

1674
01:57:37,791 --> 01:57:42,791
I made you say
such a vulgar thing

1675
01:57:42,875 --> 01:57:45,166
in front of a
respectable committee.

1676
01:57:45,333 --> 01:57:46,875
What's vulgar in tonsils?

1677
01:57:47,583 --> 01:57:51,291
So it is not vulgar
to talk about tonsils?

1678
01:57:53,208 --> 01:57:55,916
It is not vulgar to
talk about a fractured hand?

1679
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,666
It is not vulgar to talk
about appendix and diabetes?

1680
01:57:58,750 --> 01:58:02,791
Then why is it vulgar to
talk about reproductive organs?

1681
01:58:02,875 --> 01:58:04,375
Are they not your body parts?

1682
01:58:05,291 --> 01:58:06,125
Yes?

1683
01:58:08,666 --> 01:58:10,875
Do you get them installed separately,
privately?

1684
01:58:14,750 --> 01:58:15,833
Vulgar.

1685
01:58:16,416 --> 01:58:19,416
We live in a country
where someone has said

1686
01:58:19,500 --> 01:58:23,291
that a peahen gets
pregnant by consuming

1687
01:58:23,375 --> 01:58:25,333
our national bird, a peacock's tears.

1688
01:58:26,333 --> 01:58:27,916
This is how backward our thinking is.

1689
01:58:28,166 --> 01:58:29,916
Such people have a problem
with not just human sex life

1690
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:31,416
but a peacock's sex live as well.

1691
01:58:39,375 --> 01:58:40,541
Why don't you explain it to them?

1692
01:58:40,625 --> 01:58:42,500
Question them so that
we can put our point across.

1693
01:58:43,458 --> 01:58:44,500
Question them.

1694
01:58:44,708 --> 01:58:45,666
Calm down.

1695
01:58:46,708 --> 01:58:48,625
I have a question.

1696
01:58:48,708 --> 01:58:53,250
How did 1.3 billion
of us come into existence?

1697
01:58:54,208 --> 01:58:55,708
Does anyone know?

1698
01:58:57,166 --> 01:58:58,250
Did we fall from the sky?

1699
01:58:58,333 --> 01:58:59,916
Sir, the lab report.

1700
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:04,416
Did a crane leave you in your
courtyard when you were just a baby?

1701
01:59:06,583 --> 01:59:07,916
Did you grow on a tree?

1702
01:59:08,083 --> 01:59:10,916
Where you plucked
off a tree like an apple?

1703
01:59:14,083 --> 01:59:15,875
We are here because of this.

1704
01:59:16,958 --> 01:59:19,791
We all do it.
Those who don't, come and take my help.

1705
01:59:22,250 --> 01:59:23,375
What nonsense!

1706
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:25,625
We all do it.
Our parents do it.

1707
01:59:25,708 --> 01:59:26,541
Our forefathers did it.

1708
01:59:26,625 --> 01:59:27,500
And those who came
before them also did it.

1709
01:59:27,583 --> 01:59:29,375
That's why there are 1.3 billion of us.

1710
01:59:32,333 --> 01:59:34,875
But we are taught not to talk about it.

1711
01:59:36,958 --> 01:59:39,000
We feel suffocated, we feel frustrated.

1712
01:59:40,208 --> 01:59:41,333
We feel embarrassed.

1713
01:59:45,125 --> 01:59:46,375
What does that result in?

1714
01:59:47,041 --> 01:59:47,875
Deformation.

1715
01:59:51,166 --> 01:59:54,041
That results in molestation...

1716
01:59:54,916 --> 01:59:57,166
child abuse and what not.

1717
02:00:00,750 --> 02:00:02,750
Husbands and wives fights.

1718
02:00:02,916 --> 02:00:04,750
They don't come out and say it.

1719
02:00:09,541 --> 02:00:14,833
That results in domestic violence,
affairs and can end up in divorce.

1720
02:00:15,625 --> 02:00:17,625
I have witnessed it. Divorce.

1721
02:00:17,708 --> 02:00:20,583
Has anyone divorced because of tonsils?

1722
02:00:20,833 --> 02:00:21,791
Yes?

1723
02:00:23,500 --> 02:00:24,750
What rubbish!

1724
02:00:29,166 --> 02:00:30,791
I had learnt this in Uganda.

1725
02:00:31,333 --> 02:00:32,500
Then the new government was formed.

1726
02:00:32,583 --> 02:00:34,375
They said, "Hey, what are you doing!
Go away!"

1727
02:00:34,458 --> 02:00:36,291
I ran away from there.
I ran away like a coward.

1728
02:00:36,375 --> 02:00:39,958
I opened a small clinic in Ahmadabad
and started advising people.

1729
02:00:41,291 --> 02:00:43,250
Then one day, a patient came to me...

1730
02:00:45,041 --> 02:00:46,375
who later became my friend.

1731
02:00:46,958 --> 02:00:49,958
He said, "Sir, we will make money.

1732
02:00:50,250 --> 02:00:53,833
I will be a businessman.

1733
02:00:54,208 --> 02:00:56,833
We will open awareness centers for you.

1734
02:00:56,916 --> 02:00:59,250
We will spread awareness."

1735
02:01:01,958 --> 02:01:03,375
He gave me courage.

1736
02:01:14,041 --> 02:01:16,708
Let me tell you something very clearly.

1737
02:01:17,583 --> 02:01:19,583
I am not in Uganda anymore.

1738
02:01:24,750 --> 02:01:27,291
No matter what you say,
I won't keep quiet.

1739
02:01:27,375 --> 02:01:30,291
Shoot me or hang me
or send me to the moon.

1740
02:01:30,375 --> 02:01:33,958
I'll send WhatsApp messages
from the moon and spread awareness.

1741
02:01:54,791 --> 02:01:59,166
We tested 60 random
samples of your product.

1742
02:02:36,666 --> 02:02:38,875
Sir, I hope you are
no longer upset with me.

1743
02:02:43,500 --> 02:02:48,041
Scoundrel, you were fooling
us for the last 24 hours.

1744
02:02:48,708 --> 02:02:50,208
Come on, sir, how can I do that?

1745
02:02:50,666 --> 02:02:53,000
I kept telling you that there
is nothing objectionable in the product.

1746
02:02:53,083 --> 02:02:54,375
But you paid no heed to me.

1747
02:02:54,500 --> 02:02:58,083
At least tell us what that
Chinese hunter had sent you.

1748
02:02:58,500 --> 02:03:00,625
He has sent the Chinese tiger soup, sir.

1749
02:03:01,250 --> 02:03:04,833
Hao Li was duping everyone. He had
Chinese herbs in the soup that he sold.

1750
02:03:08,541 --> 02:03:09,750
Aren't you scared?

1751
02:03:13,166 --> 02:03:15,541
Do you know the most important
thing needed to start a business?

1752
02:03:16,041 --> 02:03:17,000
What?

1753
02:03:17,208 --> 02:03:18,583
Balls of steel.

1754
02:03:23,666 --> 02:03:24,666
Would you like some, sir?

1755
02:03:25,958 --> 02:03:27,416
In a steel bowl?

1756
02:03:27,916 --> 02:03:28,750
Let's go.

1757
02:03:29,958 --> 02:03:32,541
I made you go global in 24 hours.

1758
02:03:32,708 --> 02:03:34,291
Now I will show you your brand value.

1759
02:03:38,625 --> 02:03:43,083
<span style="style.center_1">A true businessman sells</span>
<span style="style.center_1">a solution and not a problem.</span>

1760
02:03:43,958 --> 02:03:45,208
<span style="style.center_1">And that's why</span>

1761
02:03:45,291 --> 02:03:48,333
<span style="style.center_1">the solution called Vardhi was soon</span>
<span style="style.center_1">about to become a household name.</span>

1762
02:03:56,666 --> 02:03:59,791
Rukmani, your husband has
left a mark on an industry

1763
02:03:59,875 --> 02:04:02,250
that isn't much valued in our society.

1764
02:04:27,208 --> 02:04:28,666
Mr. Raghuveer Mehta.

1765
02:04:38,125 --> 02:04:39,333
Who is the customer?

1766
02:04:39,416 --> 02:04:40,708
Sir, the customer is the king.

1767
02:04:42,125 --> 02:04:43,791
Sir, a customer is like God.

1768
02:04:44,375 --> 02:04:45,750
Sir, a customer means business.
