Andi in "Pretty in Pink."

00:08:45,452 --> 00:08:48,172
- It's just a movie, you're
looking so beautiful.

47
00:08:48,172 --> 00:08:50,775
- You watch English films?

48
00:08:50,775 --> 00:08:53,047
Oh my god, we can watch them together!

49
00:08:53,047 --> 00:08:55,447
- No no, not like that, I used
to watch when I was young.

Um, I got something for you.

It's considered auspicious
and it's from me to you.

00:09:05,452 --> 00:09:07,633
- Mom, you don't have to do this.

53
00:09:07,633 --> 00:09:10,513
Dad just gave this to me today morning.

54
00:09:10,513 --> 00:09:12,930
- Madhu, it's from me to you.

55
00:09:13,975 --> 00:09:18,170
- Mom, it's the same
thing, it's dad's money.

You know what, we can actually this money

57
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:23,313
to beat Aditya and dad in poker.

58
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:26,551
Use their money to beat
their money, what say?

59
00:09:26,551 --> 00:09:29,532
Here, you're the prettiest, sweetest,

60
00:09:29,532 --> 00:09:32,949
and the nicest mother-in-law, I love you.

61
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:43,740
- Come on, dad, where's the luck?

62
00:09:44,631 --> 00:09:46,631

63
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:50,332

00:10:02,013 --> 00:10:04,139
And I have none.
- Yes!

68
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:08,389

Indu's still in the game.

00:10:14,216 --> 00:10:15,049
- Fold.

70
00:10:16,035 --> 00:10:17,757

00:10:17,757 --> 00:10:19,355
- I want the money!
- How can you take the money?

72
00:10:19,355 --> 00:10:23,491
- You are a married man,
don't behave like a kid.

73
00:10:23,491 --> 00:10:25,352
- Listen.
- This is all mine, yes.

74
00:10:25,352 --> 00:10:27,149
- I know, Raghav, but he's still a baby.

75
00:10:27,149 --> 00:10:28,559
- I'm telling you.
- No, this is my money.

76
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:29,809
What, I won it!

77
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,997

00:10:53,912 --> 00:10:56,371
I have really good news to share with you.

81
00:10:56,371 --> 00:10:58,176
(speaking in foreign language)

82
00:10:58,176 --> 00:10:59,461
Mom, I've been promoted.

83
00:10:59,461 --> 00:11:01,600

89
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:16,596
(speaking in foreign language)

90
00:11:16,596 --> 00:11:18,015
- How can I send that?

91
00:11:18,015 --> 00:11:19,738
- I know but, you know,

92
00:11:19,738 --> 00:11:21,876
if I figure out a way
for you to make it fresh

93
00:11:21,876 --> 00:11:23,359
will you make it then?

94
00:11:23,359 --> 00:11:24,593
(speaking in foreign language)

95
00:11:24,593 --> 00:11:27,010
Mom, I've booked you a ticket to Bangkok.

It's non-refundable, you can't so no.

You have to come.

00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:35,831
(speaking in foreign language)

99
00:11:35,831 --> 00:11:37,948
Mom, come on, it's from
my first ever bonus.

00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:39,991
And we both reach Bangkok on the same day.

101
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:42,147
You have one month to
go, you can't say no.

102
00:11:42,147 --> 00:11:44,703
And dad, check your mail,
I've sent you the ticket.

103
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:45,891
Bye, take care.

104
00:11:45,891 --> 00:11:49,812
(speaking in foreign language)

105
00:11:49,812 --> 00:11:52,591
- All will be fine, don't worry.

106
00:11:52,591 --> 00:11:56,388
(plane engines roar)

107
00:11:56,388 --> 00:11:58,971
(bright music)

108
00:12:08,146 --> 00:12:12,063
(speaking in foreign language)

109
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,925
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

110
00:12:19,925 --> 00:12:22,410
No, no, no taxi, no taxi.

111
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:23,577
I am with her.

112
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:26,704
Hello.

113
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,871

00:12:33,391 --> 00:12:35,127

116
00:12:35,127 --> 00:12:37,627
I mean, your good name please?

117
00:12:38,671 --> 00:12:41,610
- Indu.
- Indu, very good name.

118
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:44,692
First time visiting to Bangkok?

119
00:12:44,692 --> 00:12:46,868
- First time abroad.

120
00:12:46,868 --> 00:12:47,951
- Okay, okay.

121
00:12:50,452 --> 00:12:51,952
You are with whom?

122
00:12:53,048 --> 00:12:54,381
- Alone.
- Alone?

123
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,369
You have told me this thing

124
00:12:57,369 --> 00:13:00,271
but don't tell this thing to anyone.

125
00:13:00,271 --> 00:13:04,431
See the weird and strange people around.

126
00:13:04,431 --> 00:13:08,189
I have to catch such weirdos
and take them to my hostel.

127
00:13:08,189 --> 00:13:10,606
Okay, Indu, nice meeting you.

128
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:13,850
- Thank you so much.
- And bye bye.

129
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:16,965
(speaking in foreign language)

130
00:13:16,965 --> 00:13:18,987
You want a lift?

131
00:13:18,987 --> 00:13:20,389
- No, no.

132
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:22,469
I have my son outside at the airport.

133
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:23,719
- Oh, your son?

134
00:13:24,747 --> 00:13:27,365
You're very lucky, Indu.

135
00:13:27,365 --> 00:13:30,411
(speaking in foreign language)

136
00:13:30,411 --> 00:13:33,328
I mean, my one and only son, Lucky,

137
00:13:34,233 --> 00:13:37,653
he is as useless as his father was.

138
00:13:37,653 --> 00:13:41,570
(speaking in foreign language)

139
00:13:43,893 --> 00:13:48,246
Okay, Indu, have nice
day in Bangkok, okay.

140
00:13:48,246 --> 00:13:49,364
(speaking in foreign language)

141
00:13:49,364 --> 00:13:51,562
You take care.
- Sure, thank you so much.

142
00:13:51,562 --> 00:13:55,479
(speaking in foreign language)

143
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,683
No taxi, no, I don't want taxi.

144
00:14:21,238 --> 00:14:23,238
(sighs)

145
00:14:24,729 --> 00:14:25,947
- Hi, mom.

146
00:14:25,947 --> 00:14:29,309
(speaking in foreign language)

147
00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:31,548
Mom, I'm really sorry.

148
00:14:31,548 --> 00:14:33,148
Mom, actually I was trying to call you

149
00:14:33,148 --> 00:14:34,329
but you were in the flight.

150
00:14:34,329 --> 00:14:36,089
My trip got extended by three days,

151
00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:37,273
I couldn't leave the site.

152
00:14:37,273 --> 00:14:38,940
I really tried, mom.

153
00:14:40,153 --> 00:14:42,169
- But, (speaking in foreign
language), I can't stay here.

154
00:14:42,169 --> 00:14:44,793
I'll have to, I'll go
back to India, it's okay.

155
00:14:44,793 --> 00:14:46,713
- No no, mom, mom,
please don't get tensed.

156
00:14:46,713 --> 00:14:49,087
Mom, Steve is there, he
is my very good friend.

157
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:52,510
He'll take care of you
and he'll take you home.

158
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,513
(speaking in foreign language)

159
00:14:53,513 --> 00:14:55,833
- I'll buy my ticket and
I'll go back to India.

160
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,753
I don't want--
- No no, mom, please.

161
00:14:57,753 --> 00:14:59,091
Mom, I've already bought
you a return ticket.

162
00:14:59,091 --> 00:15:00,889
I'll feel awful, like now
that you've come all the way

163
00:15:00,889 --> 00:15:02,073
you will go back then.

164
00:15:02,073 --> 00:15:03,731
Mom, please just,

165
00:15:03,731 --> 00:15:05,687
just wait for three days,
I'll be there soon, okay?

166
00:15:05,687 --> 00:15:06,854
One last time.

167
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,654
(speaking in foreign language)

168
00:15:11,654 --> 00:15:13,516
- Talk to Aakash.

169
00:15:13,516 --> 00:15:14,349
- Bye-bye.

170
00:15:17,097 --> 00:15:18,974
Let me just help you.
- Hey, stop, stop!

171
00:15:18,974 --> 00:15:20,297
You crook!

172
00:15:20,297 --> 00:15:21,837
I'll take you to the cops.

173
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:23,134
- Shut up!

174
00:15:23,134 --> 00:15:24,217
I'm with her.

175
00:15:25,417 --> 00:15:26,250
- Indu?

176
00:15:28,398 --> 00:15:30,318
You have a (speaking in
foreign language) son?

177
00:15:30,318 --> 00:15:32,516
That too without visiting abroad before?

178
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:34,814
(speaking in foreign language)

179
00:15:34,814 --> 00:15:36,331
- He's not my son.

180
00:15:36,331 --> 00:15:38,664
He's my son's friend, Steve.

181
00:15:40,297 --> 00:15:41,214
- I got it.

182
00:15:44,718 --> 00:15:47,337
(speaking in foreign language)

183
00:15:47,337 --> 00:15:51,236
You take my card, you are not alone here.

184
00:15:51,236 --> 00:15:52,986
Give me a call, okay.

185
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:58,158
(speaking in foreign language)

186
00:15:58,158 --> 00:15:59,575
They're all same!

187
00:16:00,718 --> 00:16:04,635
(speaking in foreign language)

188
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:10,642
Take care, call me if
you need me, okay, bye!

189
00:16:10,642 --> 00:16:13,077
(speaking in foreign language)

190
00:16:13,077 --> 00:16:15,910
- I'll take it.
- It's okay, ma'am.

191
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,189
(thuds)

192
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:25,844
Hey, backseat is for babies and taxis.

193
00:16:25,844 --> 00:16:29,594
Let me give you a front
seat vie of Thailand.

194
00:16:34,438 --> 00:16:36,780
(thuds)

195
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:39,197
(calm music)

196
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:54,561
(speaking in foreign language)

197
00:16:54,561 --> 00:16:56,653
Are you liking what you see?

198
00:16:56,653 --> 00:16:57,486
- Yeah.

199
00:17:02,977 --> 00:17:05,727
- This is your first time, right?

200
00:17:12,358 --> 00:17:16,300
So, do you speak English back home too?

201
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,133
- Mm-hmm.

202
00:17:18,193 --> 00:17:20,433
We speak Telegu at home.

203
00:17:20,433 --> 00:17:23,953
I know English, I watch English movies.

204
00:17:23,953 --> 00:17:25,703
- English movies, eh?

205
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:29,427
(calm music)

206
00:17:49,377 --> 00:17:51,127
- Such a small house.

207
00:17:52,476 --> 00:17:55,143
(curious music)

208
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:07,568
Such small rooms.

209
00:18:14,854 --> 00:18:16,254
(speaking in foreign language)

210
00:18:16,254 --> 00:18:17,398
- Excuse me?

211
00:18:17,398 --> 00:18:18,481
- This is it?

212
00:18:42,876 --> 00:18:45,474
(clears throat)

213
00:18:45,474 --> 00:18:48,054
Ah, one bathroom, one bedroom?

214
00:18:48,054 --> 00:18:51,387
- Yes, it's quite the luxury in Bangkok.

215
00:18:52,316 --> 00:18:56,156
You must be hungry, let me
check if I've got something.

216
00:18:56,156 --> 00:18:59,076
I wasn't expecting to fetch
you so I am not prepared.

217
00:18:59,076 --> 00:18:59,909
- Okay.

218
00:19:05,857 --> 00:19:06,690
Steve.

219
00:19:09,889 --> 00:19:11,222
This is for you.

220
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:15,170
- No need to tip me, Hindu.

221
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:17,253
- Indu, it is Indu, no H.

222
00:19:22,438 --> 00:19:26,337
Who is sleeping here?
- I guess you would.

223
00:19:26,337 --> 00:19:27,170
- Me?

224
00:19:28,257 --> 00:19:30,757
(phone rings)

225
00:19:31,777 --> 00:19:33,217
- Aakash.

226
00:19:33,217 --> 00:19:35,172
- Aakash?
- Hey.

227
00:19:35,172 --> 00:19:38,172
Yes, yes, just getting Indu settled.

228
00:19:41,831 --> 00:19:42,998
Yeah, hold on.

229
00:19:44,344 --> 00:19:49,094
- Aakash, (speaking in foreign language)

230
00:19:55,208 --> 00:20:00,043
- [Aakash] Mom, he's not my
friend, he's also my roommate.

231
00:20:00,043 --> 00:20:02,543
- Roommate?
- He'll stay there.

232
00:20:03,805 --> 00:20:07,722
(speaking in foreign language)

233
00:20:09,796 --> 00:20:13,452
- Oh, okay, just give him the phone.

234
00:20:13,452 --> 00:20:17,035
- Okay, Aakash wants to talk to you.

235
00:20:17,035 --> 00:20:17,868
- Hey.

236
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,313
Okay.

237
00:20:22,341 --> 00:20:24,258
Roommate, like, really?

238
00:20:25,221 --> 00:20:27,621
(sighs) Yeah.

239
00:20:27,621 --> 00:20:29,038
Yeah, okay, okay.

240
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,067
I didn't know, love.

241
00:20:34,021 --> 00:20:37,021
Indian food store, right, okay, bye.

242
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,798
Sorry, Indu, I didn't realize

243
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:45,359
it works like that in Indian families.

244
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:47,376
You settled in,

245
00:20:47,376 --> 00:20:49,323
I'll prep some food.

246
00:20:49,323 --> 00:20:50,406
- Yeah, okay.

247
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,717
(speaking in foreign language)

248
00:21:05,803 --> 00:21:08,470
(curious music)

249
00:21:24,144 --> 00:21:26,880
(moves into bright music)

250
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,713
Aakash.

251
00:21:43,723 --> 00:21:47,640
At least he is staying with his roommate.

252
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,723
At least he is not alone.

253
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:51,936
Roommate...

254
00:21:56,203 --> 00:22:00,251
(speaking in foreign language)

255
00:22:00,251 --> 00:22:02,918
(curious music)

256
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:16,340
(engines rumble)

257
00:22:30,134 --> 00:22:30,967
- Is this?

258
00:22:33,654 --> 00:22:37,952
- This is a first, where's that
gorgeous boyfriend of yours?

259
00:22:37,952 --> 00:22:40,609
This is usually his domain.

260
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,650
Oh, are you making like a
romantic dinner for him.

261
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:45,275
You have to let me help.

262
00:22:45,275 --> 00:22:48,635
You my dear man will be total
disaster in the kitchen.

263
00:22:48,635 --> 00:22:49,718
No, you need.

264
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:53,952
This is such an aphrodisiac.

265
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:56,955
Your bed's gonna be banging, trust me.

266
00:22:56,955 --> 00:22:59,995
- No, no, no, Pixie, before
you say another word,

267
00:22:59,995 --> 00:23:01,613
this is for Aakash's mother.

268
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:03,533
She's here visiting from India

269
00:23:03,533 --> 00:23:05,453
and Aakash is abroad in New York.

270
00:23:05,453 --> 00:23:08,375
I don't know what I'm supposed to do but--

271
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:12,237
- Shh, Steve, darling, you
know the way to a man's heart

272
00:23:12,237 --> 00:23:13,433
is through his stomach.

273
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:15,954
Well, among other things.

274
00:23:15,954 --> 00:23:18,650
But the way to an Indian man's heart

275
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:21,495
is only through his mother.

276
00:23:21,495 --> 00:23:23,421
Leave this to me.

277
00:23:23,421 --> 00:23:25,504
Let's see, you need this.

278
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,353
This.

279
00:23:28,355 --> 00:23:31,605
And this, this is great, I promise you.

280
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,553
You will thank me your whole life.

281
00:23:37,704 --> 00:23:41,282
So, trust me, it's a
really, really good recipe.

282
00:23:41,282 --> 00:23:45,602
I tried it, you can trust me.
- Smells good.

283
00:23:45,602 --> 00:23:46,882
- Yeah.

284
00:23:46,882 --> 00:23:47,715
Oh.

285
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:51,398
I wanted to meet her, what a pity.

286
00:23:51,398 --> 00:23:54,148
- Shh, meet her tomorrow.
- Okay.

287
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,883
- Okay, see you tomorrow.
- Goodnight.

288
00:24:06,057 --> 00:24:07,879
(phone rings)

289
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:09,341
- Yes, Indu, how are you?

290
00:24:09,341 --> 00:24:13,258
(speaking in foreign language)

291
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,280
Don't cry, Indu.

292
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,586
- No, Raghav, please.

293
00:24:19,586 --> 00:24:23,503
(speaking in foreign language)

294
00:24:25,762 --> 00:24:28,520
- Okay, okay, I'll do something.

295
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:32,925
(speaking in foreign language)

296
00:24:32,925 --> 00:24:35,586
Okay, just give me a few hours.

297
00:24:35,586 --> 00:24:40,125
(speaking in foreign language)

298
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:42,208
(sniffs)

299
00:24:49,245 --> 00:24:50,412
- Indu, you...

300
00:24:51,965 --> 00:24:52,798
- Om.

301
00:24:53,985 --> 00:24:55,485
Om.

302
00:24:55,485 --> 00:24:56,318
Om.

303
00:24:57,666 --> 00:25:00,133
- I'm headed for work.

304
00:25:00,133 --> 00:25:02,111
There's some food in the fridge.

305
00:25:02,111 --> 00:25:02,944
- Om.

306
00:25:04,293 --> 00:25:06,043
Om.
- Have a good day.

307
00:25:13,093 --> 00:25:15,176
(sniffs)

308
00:26:01,455 --> 00:26:05,372
(speaking in foreign language)

309
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:31,463
(soft music)

310
00:27:09,682 --> 00:27:12,661
- [Aakash] Mom, every
moment away from you,

311
00:27:12,661 --> 00:27:14,994
from your voice, I miss you.

312
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,021
You knew everything about me,

313
00:27:20,021 --> 00:27:22,320
you protected me, you understood me.

314
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,403
And loved me.

315
00:27:25,781 --> 00:27:27,364
And yet even though

316
00:27:29,258 --> 00:27:31,894
I know you love me and always will

317
00:27:31,894 --> 00:27:35,644
I'm not sure you understand
me, or ever will.

318
00:27:37,562 --> 00:27:41,729
Now even when I'm with you
I feel like I miss you.

319
00:27:44,122 --> 00:27:46,622
(phone rings)

320
00:27:48,856 --> 00:27:50,682
- Hello, Aakash.

321
00:27:50,682 --> 00:27:52,282
- [Aakash] Mom, dad just called me.

322
00:27:52,282 --> 00:27:55,381
Mom, look, I'll be back in three days.

323
00:27:55,381 --> 00:27:59,061
(speaking in foreign language)

324
00:27:59,061 --> 00:28:02,581
- You said you'd be back in two days.

325
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:04,294
- [Aakash] I know, I'm
trying as fast, mom,

326
00:28:04,294 --> 00:28:05,732
but you know that I will hate myself

327
00:28:05,732 --> 00:28:08,423
even more if you go now.

328
00:28:08,423 --> 00:28:09,775
- No, it's okay, (speaking
in foreign language),

329
00:28:09,775 --> 00:28:11,021
complete your work.

330
00:28:11,021 --> 00:28:14,954
(speaking in foreign language)
I'll wait for you here.

331
00:28:14,954 --> 00:28:15,871
Bye, Aakash

332
00:28:24,555 --> 00:28:27,388
(uplifting music)

333
00:29:15,129 --> 00:29:17,786
(chuckles)

334
00:29:17,786 --> 00:29:21,871
♪ Tell me, happiness ♪

335
00:29:21,871 --> 00:29:26,538
♪ This is more than I, more than I need ♪

336
00:29:46,832 --> 00:29:49,749
(fire alarm wails)

337
00:29:50,894 --> 00:29:52,997
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Steve.

338
00:29:52,997 --> 00:29:54,698
I don't know what...

339
00:29:54,698 --> 00:29:56,519
I was, I was actually only cooking,

340
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:57,943
I don't know what's happened.

341
00:29:57,943 --> 00:29:59,682
Just check!

342
00:29:59,682 --> 00:30:01,143
- It's perfectly all right, Indu.

343
00:30:01,143 --> 00:30:05,810
It happens to me every time
I decide to cook for Aakash.

344
00:30:09,244 --> 00:30:10,710
I'll tell you what,

345
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:12,829
there's a lovely food court down the road.

346
00:30:12,829 --> 00:30:15,932
Come, let's go grab a
bite, the food is good.

347
00:30:15,932 --> 00:30:17,265
- But it's okay?

348
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:20,132
- It's okay.
- Yeah.

349
00:30:20,132 --> 00:30:22,799
(curious music)

350
00:30:30,044 --> 00:30:32,890
- All right then, what
would you like to have?

351
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:34,844
- What are you having, Steve?

352
00:30:34,844 --> 00:30:38,011
- I love the spicy pad thai.
- me too.

353
00:30:39,247 --> 00:30:40,747
- Ah, it's, its...

354
00:30:49,018 --> 00:30:51,268
(chuckles)

355
00:30:53,741 --> 00:30:54,741
- Thank you.

356
00:31:04,471 --> 00:31:07,457
(speaking in foreign language)

357
00:31:07,457 --> 00:31:08,374
It's spicy.

358
00:31:09,551 --> 00:31:10,877
No, no.

359
00:31:10,877 --> 00:31:12,877
(gasps)

360
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:15,572
- Um...

361
00:31:20,403 --> 00:31:22,021
Sorry.

362
00:31:22,021 --> 00:31:23,104
Are you fine?

363
00:31:25,861 --> 00:31:27,498
You haven't eaten anything, Indu.

364
00:31:27,498 --> 00:31:29,317
Would you like to go to some other place.

365
00:31:29,317 --> 00:31:32,984
- No, Steve, I wanna
go back home to change.

366
00:31:48,596 --> 00:31:50,129
- Steve!

367
00:31:50,129 --> 00:31:52,437
Hello, I'm Pixie, your son's

368
00:31:52,437 --> 00:31:54,634
and this useless man's neighbor.

369
00:31:54,634 --> 00:31:58,134
I'm so excited to meet you, gorgeous lady.

370
00:31:59,308 --> 00:32:00,830
Wait a minute.

371
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:03,710
(speaking in foreign language)

372
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:07,651
- Oh, so sweet, Pixie.
- Wait, wait, I know more.

373
00:32:07,651 --> 00:32:10,674
(speaking in foreign language)

374
00:32:10,674 --> 00:32:12,039
Oops.

375
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:14,943
I'm sorry, I guess the
shopkeeper played a prank on me.

376
00:32:14,943 --> 00:32:18,121
By the way, where are the
beauty and the beast off to?

377
00:32:18,121 --> 00:32:21,102
- Ha ha ha ha, very funny.

378
00:32:21,102 --> 00:32:22,660
Indu happened to spill juice on herself

379
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:26,122
and we are going home so
she can change her clothes.

380
00:32:26,122 --> 00:32:28,460
- How boring can you get, huh?

381
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,700
Indu, you are in Bangkok, come with me.

382
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,343
I have to take you shopping.

383
00:32:33,343 --> 00:32:36,740
- No, Pixie, I wanna go
home to change my saree.

384
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:39,460
- Come, come change here.

385
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:42,043

- Why, what happened?

401
00:34:33,944 --> 00:34:36,024
- I didn't like it.

402
00:34:36,024 --> 00:34:37,784
- You're just like your son.

403
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:40,926
- She's prettier, you blind man.

404
00:34:40,926 --> 00:34:44,563
Oh, sorry, I forgot you
only find men beautiful.

405
00:34:44,563 --> 00:34:47,486
- Pixie, you like this
dress what I'm wearing?

406
00:34:47,486 --> 00:34:49,021
- I love it.

407
00:34:49,021 --> 00:34:51,581
You should love it too.

408
00:34:51,581 --> 00:34:54,401
So, how did you like shopping with me.

409
00:34:54,401 --> 00:34:57,944
- It's nice shopping with you.
- Bangkok is great, I know.

410
00:34:57,944 --> 00:35:00,403
- Did you enjoy shopping
today, Steve, with us?

411
00:35:00,403 --> 00:35:02,622
- Yeah, no, it was great,
it was fun, did you?

412
00:35:02,622 --> 00:35:04,344
- Yes, it was nice.

413
00:35:04,344 --> 00:35:06,046
- It's a beautiful dress by the way.

414
00:35:06,046 --> 00:35:07,763
- Oh, you think it's looking nice On me?

415
00:35:07,763 --> 00:35:09,363
- Definitely.
(biker whistles)

416
00:35:09,363 --> 00:35:12,382
- Oh, I get so much attention, you know.

417
00:35:12,382 --> 00:35:14,462
But, thank you.

418
00:35:14,462 --> 00:35:16,900
- It's for her, not for you.

419
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:17,733
- Me?

420
00:35:17,733 --> 00:35:22,443
(laughs)
- Shut up, Steve, come on.

421
00:35:22,443 --> 00:35:23,641
- Come on, Steve, let's go.

422
00:35:23,641 --> 00:35:26,324
- We can't take him shopping with us.

423
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:27,782
(children shouting)

424
00:35:27,782 --> 00:35:30,984
(playful music)

425
00:35:30,984 --> 00:35:32,234
- [Steve] Darn.

426
00:35:37,141 --> 00:35:40,821
- Steve, when was the last
time you waxed your bum?

427
00:35:40,821 --> 00:35:41,654
- Shut up.

428
00:35:42,523 --> 00:35:45,781
Why would you always
want to say something?

429
00:35:45,781 --> 00:35:46,614
- Steve.

430
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:49,919
You have a tattoo?

431
00:35:49,919 --> 00:35:50,752
- Yes.

432
00:35:54,932 --> 00:35:56,265
It says, Aakash.

433
00:36:00,133 --> 00:36:01,952
- What's the point of
having a tattoo there

434
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:03,952
where no one can see it?

435
00:36:06,442 --> 00:36:08,525
(groans)

436
00:36:09,377 --> 00:36:11,127
It's okay, it's okay.

437
00:36:12,652 --> 00:36:13,485
It's okay.

438
00:36:14,753 --> 00:36:17,503
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, it's okay.

439
00:36:26,132 --> 00:36:28,549
- Are you kidding me, Aakash?

440
00:36:30,003 --> 00:36:33,985
I thought you said you
were done with that?

441
00:36:33,985 --> 00:36:36,317
You really, you really need to learn

442
00:36:36,317 --> 00:36:38,234
to say no more clearly.

443
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,647
What do you mean you don't know how to?

444
00:36:44,647 --> 00:36:46,647
Try something like this.

445
00:37:16,807 --> 00:37:19,084
- Good morning, Steve.
- Good morning.

446
00:37:19,084 --> 00:37:23,983
- I made some eggs but was
not sure how you like them.

447
00:37:23,983 --> 00:37:26,305
- Indu, this is really sweet of you.

448
00:37:26,305 --> 00:37:28,865
You didn't have to go
through all this trouble,

449
00:37:28,865 --> 00:37:30,284
I like them anyhow.

450
00:37:30,284 --> 00:37:32,647
- I made the eggs just
the way Aakash likes them,

451
00:37:32,647 --> 00:37:34,482
I'm sure you'll like them too.

452
00:37:34,482 --> 00:37:36,428
(chuckles)

453
00:37:36,428 --> 00:37:37,261
- Sure.

454
00:37:38,225 --> 00:37:40,642
(calm music)

455
00:37:45,447 --> 00:37:49,767
- I made sunny side,
the way Aakash likes it.

456
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:52,350
Should I pour some milk?
- Sure.

457
00:37:58,705 --> 00:38:00,705
- Have some.
- Thank you.

458
00:38:01,568 --> 00:38:02,568
- Is it all?

459
00:38:05,911 --> 00:38:07,906
- What about you?

460
00:38:07,906 --> 00:38:11,656
- I made some eggs, I'll
get them for myself.

461
00:38:15,746 --> 00:38:18,329
(chair creaks)

462
00:38:19,649 --> 00:38:20,482
Thank you.

463
00:38:38,588 --> 00:38:40,188
- You need something?

464
00:38:40,188 --> 00:38:42,487
- Steve, may I ask you something?

465
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:44,508
- Please, go ahead.

466
00:38:44,508 --> 00:38:47,068
You can ask me anything.

467
00:38:47,068 --> 00:38:49,729
- I've noticed that there
are no family pictures

468
00:38:49,729 --> 00:38:51,562
of yours in the house.

469
00:38:57,527 --> 00:39:01,409
- My, my mother died when
I was three years old.

470
00:39:01,409 --> 00:39:05,889
She was expecting her second
child and had complications.

471
00:39:05,889 --> 00:39:08,889
She left sooner than anyone thought.

472
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,122
I'm sorry, Steve, what about your father?

473
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:20,122
Where is he staying now?

474
00:39:22,442 --> 00:39:25,609
- Well, my, my father lives in London.

475
00:39:28,682 --> 00:39:31,377
We haven't spoken in seven years.

476
00:39:31,377 --> 00:39:35,280
It's a long story, but, cut it short,

477
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,947
I love music and he dislikes it.

478
00:39:39,141 --> 00:39:42,578
He never thought my music
would make any money.

479
00:39:42,578 --> 00:39:46,411
So it was either staying
with him or my music.

480
00:39:49,459 --> 00:39:50,626
And here I am.

481
00:39:54,997 --> 00:39:57,414
- So, you're a musician then?

482
00:40:04,624 --> 00:40:07,124
- I guess my father was right.

483
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,341
(phone rings)

484
00:40:12,341 --> 00:40:14,602
- [Aakash] Hey, this is Aakash and Steve.

485
00:40:14,602 --> 00:40:16,522
If you're unable to reach
us please leave a message.

486
00:40:16,522 --> 00:40:18,800
- Aakash.
- Thank you.

487
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,050
- Hey, I'm back in town,
let's catch up, love lots.

488
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,653
- Steve, are you okay.

489
00:40:28,298 --> 00:40:29,215
- All good.

490
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,550
(doorbell rings)

491
00:40:36,501 --> 00:40:37,751
- Hello, Steve.

492
00:40:39,125 --> 00:40:42,762
Hello, Indu, I've got something for you.

493
00:40:42,762 --> 00:40:44,012
Do you like it?

494
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:47,304
- Pixie, no, not for me.

495
00:40:47,304 --> 00:40:48,137
- Yes.

496
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:54,794
I can't believe I'm going to finally learn

497
00:40:54,794 --> 00:40:57,649
how to make an authentic
(speaking in foreign language).

498
00:40:57,649 --> 00:41:00,732
Indu, you're like my dream come true.

499
00:41:01,936 --> 00:41:04,470
Paprika, red chili power.

500
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:07,376
- Ah, perfect, I think
we got everything now.

501
00:41:07,376 --> 00:41:08,933
- Great.

502
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:10,516
Oh, I'm so excited.

503
00:41:12,453 --> 00:41:15,157
- That's the least I
can do, Pixie, for you.

504
00:41:15,157 --> 00:41:17,034
And I'm happy.

505
00:41:17,034 --> 00:41:19,951
- Well, there's a teeny tiny thing.

506
00:41:21,013 --> 00:41:24,044
I want you to show me how to wear a saree.

507
00:41:24,044 --> 00:41:25,211
- Indu.
- Sure.

508
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:30,200
- Oh my god, you look awesome!

509
00:41:32,571 --> 00:41:34,171
- Yes, she does.

510
00:41:34,171 --> 00:41:36,230
- It's a good thing that I recognized you.

511
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:38,397
I mean, you look gorgeous.

512
00:41:41,154 --> 00:41:43,904
- Meet Pixie, it's all her doing.

513
00:41:45,308 --> 00:41:47,142
- Hello.
- Hello.

514
00:41:47,142 --> 00:41:50,060
- Myself Simran Jeet Kaur,

515
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:52,300
I run a youth hostel in Bangkok.

516
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,542
You can come and stay.

517
00:41:53,542 --> 00:41:56,259
- I've got my own
apartment, but thank you.

518
00:41:56,259 --> 00:41:57,176
- Oh, okay.

519
00:41:59,563 --> 00:42:01,963
No problem, no problem at all.

520
00:42:01,963 --> 00:42:06,389
But yes, you can come
for dinner and drinks.

521
00:42:06,389 --> 00:42:09,718
And help me look little little like this.

522
00:42:09,718 --> 00:42:11,280
- This this.
- What say, Indu?

523
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,280
- I can try.

524
00:42:13,234 --> 00:42:15,474
- Yes! (laughs)

525
00:42:15,474 --> 00:42:17,891
(calm music)

526
00:42:31,796 --> 00:42:32,629
- Steve.

527
00:42:34,137 --> 00:42:37,854
I really love what you're
playing, it's really nice.

528
00:42:37,854 --> 00:42:39,476
- What about my photos?

529
00:42:39,476 --> 00:42:42,643
Don't you like the photographs I take?

530
00:42:46,078 --> 00:42:48,734
- My son Aakash always looks good,

531
00:42:48,734 --> 00:42:51,232
but I'm sure he is looking very handsome,

532
00:42:51,232 --> 00:42:53,472
I'm sure you shot this picture.

533
00:42:53,472 --> 00:42:56,389
- Can you see the love in his eyes?

534
00:42:58,281 --> 00:43:00,364
Oh, by the way he called.

535
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:04,297
He said he'll be a couple
more days to get here.

536
00:43:04,297 --> 00:43:05,716
Looks like it's only going to to be

537
00:43:05,716 --> 00:43:08,398
the two of us on Christmas.

538
00:43:08,398 --> 00:43:11,956
- You seem to be more
disappointed than me, Steve.

539
00:43:11,956 --> 00:43:14,358
- Well, yeah, it's just,

540
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:17,608
I get to spend that much time with him.

541
00:43:20,658 --> 00:43:24,232
Anyways, I've got an
early morning tomorrow.

542
00:43:24,232 --> 00:43:26,699
Will you be okay on your own tomorrow?

543
00:43:26,699 --> 00:43:31,515
- Oh, you remember, Steve, my
friend Simran at the airport?

544
00:43:31,515 --> 00:43:32,774
- Yeah.

545
00:43:32,774 --> 00:43:35,857
- I'm planning to visit her tomorrow.

546
00:43:38,227 --> 00:43:41,520
- Oh, yeah yeah, it's
really easy to get here.

547
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,313
All you need to do is go across the road

548
00:43:43,313 --> 00:43:47,981
and then get a tuk-tuk
from there and then you...

549
00:43:47,981 --> 00:43:51,814
- It's okay, Steve, we'll
go when you're free.

550
00:43:54,518 --> 00:43:55,601
- Indu, wait.

551
00:43:56,816 --> 00:43:57,899
- Yes, Steve?

552
00:43:58,838 --> 00:44:01,718
- Why don't you come along
with me to the shoot tomorrow?

553
00:44:01,718 --> 00:44:05,385
Maybe once I'm done we
can meet your friend.

No no, you know, it's this way, I'm sure.

00:47:46,915 --> 00:47:49,278
- Indu, with your direction sense

589
00:47:49,278 --> 00:47:51,715
I guess we'll reach London
instead of getting back home.

590
00:47:51,715 --> 00:47:53,918
- You know what, I can't do this anymore.

591
00:47:53,918 --> 00:47:56,355
I really can't, I'm not able to.

592
00:47:56,355 --> 00:47:58,792
- Come on, what if you're on your own?

593
00:47:58,792 --> 00:47:59,625
- Me?

594
00:48:00,872 --> 00:48:04,705
I won't let go of you
at all, I can't, no way.

595
00:48:08,355 --> 00:48:12,035
- I'm always around, but you
must learn to take control.

596
00:48:12,035 --> 00:48:14,868
Today, I want you to take me home.

598
00:48:17,651 --> 00:48:21,568
Okay, I'll take you home
today, come, let's go.

599
00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:27,848
- It's beautiful, I love it.

600
00:48:27,848 --> 00:48:29,971
- I got it from India.

601
00:48:29,971 --> 00:48:33,491
- It's gorgeous, the
flowers and the colors.

602
00:48:33,491 --> 00:48:36,408
So sweet.
- Let me fix this for you.

603
00:48:39,251 --> 00:48:43,168
(speaking in foreign language)

604
00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:45,263
- What?

605
00:48:48,328 --> 00:48:50,078
- You're a beautiful.

606
00:48:50,931 --> 00:48:51,764
Steve.

607
00:48:53,331 --> 00:48:57,112
Steve, where are you, I want
to say something about Pixie.

608
00:48:57,112 --> 00:49:00,168
Steve, I want to say
something about Pixie.

609
00:49:00,168 --> 00:49:01,251
Steve, Steve?

610
00:49:03,731 --> 00:49:06,481
(dramatic music)

611
00:49:36,745 --> 00:49:38,495
- What are you doing?

612
00:49:44,103 --> 00:49:47,388
- Indu, it's not what you think.

613
00:49:47,388 --> 00:49:50,721
And what do you think you're doing here?

614
00:49:53,215 --> 00:49:55,965
(engine rumbles)

615
00:50:14,372 --> 00:50:15,205
Indu.

616
00:50:16,046 --> 00:50:16,879
Go!

617
00:50:17,799 --> 00:50:18,882
Indu, listen.

618
00:50:25,177 --> 00:50:26,719
(door slams)

619
00:50:26,719 --> 00:50:30,947
- Hey, party, bye.
- Bye, have a nice time.

620
00:50:30,947 --> 00:50:33,030
- [Pedestrian] Oh, sorry.

621
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:37,599
- Indu, what a pleasant surprise.

622
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:39,860
(sobbing)

623
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:43,610
Is everything all right,
come, come let's go.

624
00:50:49,519 --> 00:50:53,686
Indu, how did you manage
to come here on your own?

625
00:50:56,537 --> 00:50:59,537
- I don't know, Simran, I just came.

626
00:51:01,081 --> 00:51:04,748
- I can't believe it,
Steve did this to you?

627
00:51:06,297 --> 00:51:08,180
- I told you what I saw.

628
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:11,847
I'm never gonna see
Steve's face ever again.

629
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:14,430
- I'm so sorry.

630
00:51:17,036 --> 00:51:20,580
(phone rings)
Phone!

631
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:22,413
- It's Aakash calling.

632
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:28,041
What do I tell him?

633
00:51:28,041 --> 00:51:30,208
How can I break his heart?

634
00:51:33,489 --> 00:51:36,072
(somber music)

635
00:51:55,009 --> 00:51:56,009
- Bad night?

636
00:51:57,570 --> 00:51:58,931
Head ache?

637
00:51:58,931 --> 00:52:00,348
- Yeah.
- Tequila?

638
00:52:01,865 --> 00:52:02,698
- No, no.

639
00:52:15,762 --> 00:52:19,484
- There is always magic in mother's hands.

640
00:52:19,484 --> 00:52:22,466
- You know what, I give
you rent discount, okay,

641
00:52:22,466 --> 00:52:24,924
but please give this
money back to me, please.

642
00:52:24,924 --> 00:52:28,066
I'll give you discount
on your stay, please,

643
00:52:28,066 --> 00:52:29,244
I really need this money,

644
00:52:29,244 --> 00:52:30,662
it's my mom's money, please understand.

645
00:52:30,662 --> 00:52:32,338
- You're a joke, man.
- No, please understand.

646
00:52:32,338 --> 00:52:34,005
- No, no.
- Hey, bro!

647
00:52:42,916 --> 00:52:47,432
Hey, Lucy, can you spot
me a couple of dollars?

648
00:52:47,432 --> 00:52:50,074
I mean, I'll adjust it in your rent.

649
00:52:50,074 --> 00:52:52,407
- Sorry, buddy, I cannot do.

650
00:52:53,594 --> 00:52:54,427
Bye.

651
00:52:56,836 --> 00:52:59,652
- Lucky, is everything all right?

652
00:52:59,652 --> 00:53:02,652
- Yeah, it's fine, I mean, it's not.

653
00:53:04,036 --> 00:53:06,175
But what can you do?

654
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:08,233
I mean, even I don't know what I can do.

655
00:53:08,233 --> 00:53:11,050
But mom's going to kill me.

656
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:15,172
- Tell me what happened,
maybe I can talk to Simran.

657
00:53:15,172 --> 00:53:17,514
- Nothing, I was just playing
poker with those three guys

658
00:53:17,514 --> 00:53:19,594
and I thought I was winning.

659
00:53:19,594 --> 00:53:24,095
But then my luck changed and
I lost more than what I had.

660
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:27,332
And now they're refusing
to pay for their stay.

661
00:53:27,332 --> 00:53:31,832
If my mom comes to know this
she's gonna throw me out.

662
00:53:32,772 --> 00:53:34,413
I really don't know what to do.

663
00:53:34,413 --> 00:53:38,794
- Lucky, can you ask
them for one more game?

664
00:53:38,794 --> 00:53:39,627
- Game?

I mean, this boy of mine comes to me

money, I just helped him.

688
00:54:51,912 --> 00:54:53,579
- That's what, Indu.

689
00:54:54,472 --> 00:54:59,016
This smart boy won back
more than what he lost.

690
00:54:59,016 --> 00:55:03,433
Thanks to you, but this
extra money, this is not his.

I mean, this is your

- If I lie to you you scold me.

694
00:55:12,171 --> 00:55:15,349
And even if I tell you the
truth then also you scold me.

695
00:55:15,349 --> 00:55:16,913

698
00:55:21,771 --> 00:55:25,931
Lucky is just trying to
prove himself to you.

699
00:55:25,931 --> 00:55:28,609
- Please, Indu, I don't need more proof

700
00:55:28,609 --> 00:55:30,790
to see how big a fool he is.

701
00:55:30,790 --> 00:55:34,571
I just don't know what to do with him!

702
00:55:34,571 --> 00:55:37,611
- I know it's tough but you
have to let go sometimes.

703
00:55:37,611 --> 00:55:42,444
Let him make mistakes, and let
him make his own decisions.

704
00:55:44,331 --> 00:55:46,867
- I guess you are right.

705
00:55:46,867 --> 00:55:50,950
But all his decisions are
big, big, big mistakes!

706

Look at you, Indu, you are counting these.

712
00:56:17,153 --> 00:56:21,611
Come on, Indu, you have
always been a rich lady.

713
00:56:21,611 --> 00:56:23,694
- Simran, this is my own.

714
00:56:24,769 --> 00:56:27,291
And I've never earned like this before

715
00:56:27,291 --> 00:56:30,209
and this is very special for me.

716
00:56:30,209 --> 00:56:34,630
Simran, what is the best taste
you were telling me about?

717
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:37,350
- No, no, no, not just
the best taste in town

718
00:56:37,350 --> 00:56:40,070
but the best seat also.

719
00:56:40,070 --> 00:56:42,320
Come, I'll show you!
- Sure.

720
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:50,406
- You know what, Indu, when I was younger

721
00:56:50,406 --> 00:56:51,367
my (speaking in foreign language)

722
00:56:51,367 --> 00:56:54,704
would take me to the park every day.

723
00:56:54,704 --> 00:56:57,871
And I would swing for hours and hours.

724
00:57:00,391 --> 00:57:04,558
It was so much of fun. (chuckles)

725
00:57:06,638 --> 00:57:09,388
But as we grew up it all changes.

726
00:57:12,108 --> 00:57:15,108
We only think about people, society.

727
00:57:19,606 --> 00:57:23,523
(speaking in foreign language)

728
00:57:34,471 --> 00:57:37,971
(upbeat electronic music)

729
00:57:50,005 --> 00:57:53,922
(speaking in foreign language)

730
00:57:55,546 --> 00:57:56,521
Did you enjoy the ice cream?

731
00:57:56,521 --> 00:57:58,203
- I love the ice cream,
what about the shopping?

732
00:57:58,203 --> 00:57:59,702
- Oh, I loved it.
- Indu!

733
00:57:59,702 --> 00:58:03,162
You haven't been answering anyone's calls.

734
00:58:03,162 --> 00:58:04,625
Indu, wait!

735
00:58:04,625 --> 00:58:08,678
- I don't wanna hear
anything, Steve, please.

736
00:58:08,678 --> 00:58:10,278
- Indu.

737
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:12,339
Indu, if you don't want to talk to me

738
00:58:12,339 --> 00:58:13,739
at least have as word with your son,

739
00:58:13,739 --> 00:58:16,081
he's been trying to contact
you since last evening.

740
00:58:16,081 --> 00:58:18,513
- How dare you put me
in this position, Steve.

741
00:58:18,513 --> 00:58:20,422
What do you want me to do, lie to my son?

742
00:58:20,422 --> 00:58:21,958
And not let him know that
you've been betraying

743
00:58:21,958 --> 00:58:23,635
and cheating on him?

744
00:58:23,635 --> 00:58:25,233
- What position am I putting you in?

745
00:58:25,233 --> 00:58:27,121
And what betrayal are you talking about?

746
00:58:27,121 --> 00:58:28,838
How can you be put in a spot for something

747
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:32,615
that you never really
accepted in the first place?

748
00:58:32,615 --> 00:58:34,549
- Never accepted?

749
00:58:34,549 --> 00:58:36,728
- Yes, me and Aakash
are in a relationship.

750
00:58:36,728 --> 00:58:39,111
But since when has that
begun to affect you?

751
00:58:39,111 --> 00:58:40,914
All right, put that aside,

752
00:58:40,914 --> 00:58:43,255
without even knowing what
the truth is and that is,

753
00:58:43,255 --> 00:58:44,871
you have come up with a conclusion

754
00:58:44,871 --> 00:58:47,271
that I'm an outsider that
you don't really listen to.

755
00:58:47,271 --> 00:58:51,938
It's fine, speak to your sone,
he'll tell you the truth.

756
00:58:57,133 --> 00:58:59,095
- Mom, where have you been all day?

757
00:58:59,095 --> 00:59:00,114
I've been trying to call you,

758
00:59:00,114 --> 00:59:01,688
Steve is also trying to reach you.

759
00:59:01,688 --> 00:59:04,249
Mom, please don't misunderstand Steve.

760
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:07,373
You know that guy that you
saw, he was just an ex,

761
00:59:07,373 --> 00:59:09,394
I mean, he was just an old friend of mine.

762
00:59:09,394 --> 00:59:11,794
He's been trying to create
problems between me and Steve

763
00:59:11,794 --> 00:59:13,933
and that's about it, he had my house keys,

764
00:59:13,933 --> 00:59:16,173
he didn't even know I was not in Bangkok.

765
00:59:16,173 --> 00:59:18,615
Mom, please just, please go back with him.

766
00:59:18,615 --> 00:59:20,151
I'm coming back tomorrow night,

767
00:59:20,151 --> 00:59:22,034
I'll explain everything to you, okay?

768
00:59:22,034 --> 00:59:23,554
(speaking in foreign language)

769
00:59:23,554 --> 00:59:25,112
Go, go home with Steve.

770
00:59:25,112 --> 00:59:26,779
Take care, mom, bye.

771
00:59:27,836 --> 00:59:29,919
(sniffs)

772
00:59:33,090 --> 00:59:37,090
(speaking in foreign language)

773
00:59:37,090 --> 00:59:39,207
(laughing)

774
00:59:39,207 --> 00:59:42,957
- I'm so sorry, it
actually does sound funny.

775
00:59:45,709 --> 00:59:48,131
(speaking in foreign language)

776
00:59:48,131 --> 00:59:48,964
Oh my god.

777
00:59:51,710 --> 00:59:53,502
- It's all right.

778
00:59:53,502 --> 00:59:56,729
I can see a bunch of singles in your hand.

779
00:59:56,729 --> 01:00:00,350
- These are my first
earnings at Simran's hostel.

780
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:03,171
- Then we should definitely put
that money to some good use.

781
01:00:03,171 --> 01:00:04,953
You surely know where to take Indu

782
01:00:04,953 --> 01:00:06,750
with these bunch of singles, right?

783
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:07,583
- Me?

784
01:00:08,451 --> 01:00:09,449
- Yeah.

785
01:00:09,449 --> 01:00:11,651
- Oh, yes, yes, yes!

786
01:00:11,651 --> 01:00:13,151
Woohoo, way to go!

787
01:00:15,673 --> 01:00:18,473
- Look at the Christmas
lights, I love this city.

788
01:00:18,473 --> 01:00:20,990
- Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait.

789
01:00:20,990 --> 01:00:22,590
- What?
- Where is Indu?

790
01:00:22,590 --> 01:00:24,046
- Indu!
- Indu, Indu!

791
01:00:24,046 --> 01:00:26,764
- She was just here right now.

792
01:00:26,764 --> 01:00:29,644
- Come on.
- Indu, where is she?

793
01:00:29,644 --> 01:00:30,662
Oh, there, there!
- Right there!

794
01:00:30,662 --> 01:00:33,484
- There, there, she's there.
- Oh, right there.

795
01:00:33,484 --> 01:00:36,725
Come on, Indu, no place
to play hide and seek.

796
01:00:36,725 --> 01:00:37,558
Not yet.

797
01:00:38,689 --> 01:00:41,606
(electronic music)

798
01:00:49,569 --> 01:00:51,696
- Steve, I can't.

799
01:00:51,696 --> 01:00:54,246
I can't come, (speaking
in foreign language).

800
01:00:54,246 --> 01:00:56,385
I've never done like this before.

801
01:00:56,385 --> 01:00:58,482
- Indu, you have one life,

802
01:00:58,482 --> 01:01:01,324
it's an experience you must experience.

803
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:05,964
- Right, but I'm very scared,
Steve, I'm very scared.

804
01:01:05,964 --> 01:01:08,547
- Hold my hand.
- I can't come.

805
01:01:12,007 --> 01:01:12,840
- Come.

806
01:01:14,666 --> 01:01:17,749
- I really, I can't come, I'm very...

807
01:01:19,245 --> 01:01:21,505
But I'm very scared.

808
01:01:21,505 --> 01:01:24,422
(electronic music)

809
01:01:26,545 --> 01:01:30,107
(speaking in foreign language)

810
01:01:30,107 --> 01:01:33,940
(singing in foreign language)

811
01:01:35,126 --> 01:01:36,376
- Woo, woo woo!

812
01:01:41,008 --> 01:01:42,634
Woo!

813
01:01:42,634 --> 01:01:46,954
- No, no, no Steve, no,
no, no, no, I can't.

814
01:01:46,954 --> 01:01:48,454
How can I do that?

815
01:01:50,794 --> 01:01:54,323
(speaking in foreign language)

816
01:01:54,323 --> 01:01:57,705
Simran, they're young
kids, let them have fun.

817
01:01:57,705 --> 01:02:00,871
- Come on, Indu, I'm young and happening.

818
01:02:00,871 --> 01:02:04,799
(speaking in foreign language)

819
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:07,103
- Do you call that makeup?

820
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:09,823
(speaking in foreign language)

821
01:02:09,823 --> 01:02:11,990
- They're going on and on.

822
01:02:13,439 --> 01:02:15,300
- [Waitress] Your drinks have come.

823
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:16,217
- Ooh, yes.

824
01:02:17,539 --> 01:02:19,039
- So guys, for us.

825
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:23,300
- No, no, no, Steve, I
don't drink, I don't drink.

826
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:26,841
- Indu, when was the last
time you had a drink?

827
01:02:26,841 --> 01:02:31,258
- I had a sip with my husband
on 31st December, 1993.

828
01:02:33,401 --> 01:02:35,641
- You make me feel old.

829
01:02:35,641 --> 01:02:37,540
- Reality check, honey.

830
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:40,383
- Ladies, calm down,
Indu, give us company.

831
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:42,505
Remember, you owe me one.

832
01:02:42,505 --> 01:02:44,287
- I owe you, Steve?
- Yeah.

833
01:02:44,287 --> 01:02:46,443
- I wore this dress because you told me.

834
01:02:46,443 --> 01:02:48,767
Now you are stretching it too far, Steve.

835
01:02:48,767 --> 01:02:49,600
See.

836
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:51,481
- Okay, okay, let's play a game.

837
01:02:51,481 --> 01:02:52,662
Every time one of these guys hits on you

838
01:02:52,662 --> 01:02:55,757
you have to do a shot, cool?

839
01:02:55,757 --> 01:02:56,590
- No.

840
01:02:58,123 --> 01:03:00,619
- Yes, Indu, come on.

841
01:03:00,619 --> 01:03:02,775
- Okay, okay Steve.

842
01:03:02,775 --> 01:03:04,443
(speaking in foreign language)

843
01:03:04,443 --> 01:03:06,976
- They won't get time from
these girls to even notice us.

844
01:03:06,976 --> 01:03:07,809
You chill.

845
01:03:09,578 --> 01:03:13,161
- Simran, you're enjoying?
- Of course, yes.

846
01:03:15,433 --> 01:03:17,183
- Where is she going?

847
01:03:18,451 --> 01:03:21,994
- Come, come, let's go, come come.

848
01:03:21,994 --> 01:03:24,827
- She is also gone.
- I don't know.

849
01:03:32,655 --> 01:03:34,738
(laughs)

850
01:03:42,234 --> 01:03:43,067
- Yeah.

851
01:03:48,771 --> 01:03:49,771
- Oh my God.

852
01:03:51,073 --> 01:03:52,268
- No, no, no.

853
01:03:52,268 --> 01:03:56,426
- It's all right, it's
okay, it's all right.

854
01:03:56,426 --> 01:03:58,958
Come on, come on, you have
to do a shot, come on.

855
01:03:58,958 --> 01:04:01,041
(clinks)

856
01:04:08,591 --> 01:04:10,132
♪ And when you go I just see a fire, no ♪

857
01:04:10,132 --> 01:04:12,372
♪ Don't the fire make me feel higher, no ♪

858
01:04:12,372 --> 01:04:13,972

can't see the fire ♪

859
01:04:13,972 --> 01:04:18,972

no, they don't see the fire ♪

860
01:04:24,073 --> 01:04:25,323
- Steve, Lucky!

861
01:04:29,769 --> 01:04:31,558
(spits)

862
01:04:31,558 --> 01:04:33,125
- Lucky!

863
01:04:33,125 --> 01:04:34,885
What are you doing here?

864
01:04:34,885 --> 01:04:36,762
- Mom, what are you doing here?

865
01:04:36,762 --> 01:04:40,679
(speaking in foreign language)

866
01:04:53,765 --> 01:04:55,265
- [Pedestrian] Yo.

867
01:04:59,301 --> 01:05:02,282
- I wish Aakash could see you like this.

868
01:05:02,282 --> 01:05:04,449
You look adorable and hot.

869
01:05:07,020 --> 01:05:11,603
Indu, why don't you dress
like this instead of a saree?

870
01:05:12,544 --> 01:05:15,904
- Steve, we love seeing new places

871
01:05:15,904 --> 01:05:18,581
and traveling to different
countries, right?

872
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:22,656
But going back home is the best feeling.

873
01:05:22,656 --> 01:05:25,077
For me, saree is something like that.

874
01:05:25,077 --> 01:05:28,479
It connects me to my
country and to my roots.

875
01:05:28,479 --> 01:05:31,797
And Steve, don't you think
I look pretty in saree?

876
01:05:31,797 --> 01:05:33,797
- Yes, you look amazing.

877
01:05:34,657 --> 01:05:36,640
- Thank you, Steve.

878
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:39,297
Talking about good
looks, I saw all the boys

879
01:05:39,297 --> 01:05:40,898
checking you out at the night club.

880
01:05:40,898 --> 01:05:42,240
(chuckles)

881
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:44,341
Well, good you're committed to my son.

882
01:05:44,341 --> 01:05:45,858
Or else there would've been a fight

883
01:05:45,858 --> 01:05:48,858
and I would have had to protect you.

884
01:05:50,976 --> 01:05:51,809
Steve.

885
01:05:54,038 --> 01:05:55,205
You know what?

886
01:05:57,329 --> 01:05:58,785
You're the kind of man

887
01:05:58,785 --> 01:06:01,969
I would like for my daughter to marry.

888
01:06:01,969 --> 01:06:05,552
Well, how does it really
matter for my son?

889
01:06:08,705 --> 01:06:09,538
Steve!

890
01:06:10,407 --> 01:06:12,683
What's your last name?

891
01:06:12,683 --> 01:06:14,850
- Harrington.
- Harrington.

892
01:06:16,268 --> 01:06:18,185
Well, Steve Harrington,

893
01:06:22,305 --> 01:06:24,684
will you marry my son?

894
01:06:24,684 --> 01:06:27,503
(laughs)

895
01:06:27,503 --> 01:06:29,868
- Now I know for sure you're drunk.

896
01:06:29,868 --> 01:06:33,447
- I mean it, it's not
drinks that is talking.

897
01:06:33,447 --> 01:06:36,464
I want you to marry Aakash, decided.

898
01:06:36,464 --> 01:06:39,244
I have decided, either you propose to him

899
01:06:39,244 --> 01:06:42,483
or I'll ask Aakash to propose to you.

900
01:06:42,483 --> 01:06:45,127
- Okay, I'll tell you what.

901
01:06:45,127 --> 01:06:47,185
If you tell me the exact same thing

902
01:06:47,185 --> 01:06:49,852
when you're sober and in a saree

903
01:06:50,924 --> 01:06:55,244
you'll have my word,
I'll propose to your son.

904
01:06:55,244 --> 01:06:56,884
- Deal.

905
01:06:56,884 --> 01:06:58,301
- Come, let's go.

906
01:07:26,444 --> 01:07:29,111
(keys jingling)

907
01:07:34,508 --> 01:07:37,091
(somber music)

908
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:48,684
(winces)

909
01:07:48,684 --> 01:07:50,851
- Oh, it's very bad, Pixie

910
01:07:51,825 --> 01:07:55,639
- Sometimes medicine is
worse than the poison.

911
01:07:55,639 --> 01:07:59,345
- I can't imagine that anybody can do this

912
01:07:59,345 --> 01:08:02,845
to another person, I really can't imagine.

913
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:10,042
- It's fine, Indu, at times
people just don't understand.

914
01:08:10,042 --> 01:08:14,125
And that's okay because
that's just who they are.

915
01:08:16,247 --> 01:08:20,364
You know, we all want to
be accepted for who we are.

916
01:08:20,364 --> 01:08:24,465
And everyone can choose
to be their true self.

917
01:08:24,465 --> 01:08:26,465
(sighs)

918
01:08:28,817 --> 01:08:31,779
All I want is to be true to myself,

919
01:08:31,779 --> 01:08:35,862
to look in the mirror and
be happy with who I am.

920
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:41,510
Even if others don't accept that.

921
01:08:46,258 --> 01:08:47,258
Let them be.

922
01:08:48,739 --> 01:08:50,257
After all, maybe in their way

923
01:08:50,257 --> 01:08:53,090
they are being true to themselves.

924
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:59,182
Maybe when they are looking in the mirror

925
01:08:59,182 --> 01:09:01,849
hate is what looks back at them.

926
01:09:03,502 --> 01:09:06,280
But Pixie, you're still beautiful.

927
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:07,113
- I know.

928
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:11,993
Thank you.

929
01:09:29,518 --> 01:09:30,351
- Steve.

930
01:09:32,339 --> 01:09:33,172
Steve.

931
01:09:34,457 --> 01:09:35,374
- Hey, hey.

932
01:09:37,817 --> 01:09:38,900
Are you okay?

933
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:41,293
- What happened?

934
01:09:42,579 --> 01:09:46,662
- I'm not drunk and I'm
sober and I wore a saree.

935
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:50,300
I want you to propose to Aakash

936
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:53,820
and I will support you in every way I can.

937
01:09:53,820 --> 01:09:55,987
(sobbing)

938
01:10:00,078 --> 01:10:02,911
(uplifting music)

939
01:10:17,756 --> 01:10:20,006
(laughing)

940
01:10:48,462 --> 01:10:51,957
It's beautiful, don't let
go of your music, Steve.

941
01:10:51,957 --> 01:10:55,400
For what you stood up
for, you're a musician.

942
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:57,233
For me, you truly are.

943
01:11:06,461 --> 01:11:09,211
(doorbell rings)

944
01:11:16,759 --> 01:11:18,842
Aakash, come, come, come.

945
01:11:20,019 --> 01:11:21,769
How are you?
- Hi mom.

946
01:11:25,742 --> 01:11:26,575
Finally.

947
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:30,393
- Check.

948
01:11:31,502 --> 01:11:33,582
- Steve did this?
- Yes.

949
01:11:33,582 --> 01:11:36,462
And see this, all the flowers.

950
01:11:36,462 --> 01:11:38,259
Come.
- Come.

951
01:11:38,259 --> 01:11:40,883
(giggling)

952
01:11:40,883 --> 01:11:42,460
Where's Steve?

953
01:11:42,460 --> 01:11:44,942
- There, he's coming.

954
01:11:44,942 --> 01:11:48,859
(speaking in foreign language)

955
01:11:55,539 --> 01:12:00,539
♪ You are my everything,
you are my everything ♪

956
01:12:03,921 --> 01:12:06,088
Aakash, will you marry me?

957
01:12:22,542 --> 01:12:23,375
- Steve.

958
01:12:24,243 --> 01:12:25,076
Steve!

959
01:12:25,076 --> 01:12:26,852
- It's okay, Indu.
- Steve, wait.

960
01:12:26,852 --> 01:12:28,105
- I'll talk to Aakash--

961
01:12:28,105 --> 01:12:31,487
- Just gonna get some fresh air.

962
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:32,320
- Steve!

963
01:12:38,307 --> 01:12:40,470
What was that, Aakash?

964
01:12:40,470 --> 01:12:41,728
- What, mom?

965
01:12:41,728 --> 01:12:43,670
- Why did you do that to Steve?

966
01:12:43,670 --> 01:12:45,248
He's been putting in so much effort

967
01:12:45,248 --> 01:12:47,488
to do things for you (speaking
in foreign language).

968
01:12:47,488 --> 01:12:50,208
I asked him to propose to you.

969
01:12:50,208 --> 01:12:54,907
He's a good guy and you've
been living under one roof.

970
01:12:54,907 --> 01:12:58,240
You must take this relationship further.

971
01:12:59,670 --> 01:13:02,147
I approve of him, (speaking
in foreign language),

972
01:13:02,147 --> 01:13:05,307
and you broke Steve's heart.

973
01:13:05,307 --> 01:13:07,557
- What about my heart, mom?

974
01:13:09,147 --> 01:13:11,670
Where were you when dad sent me to London?

975
01:13:11,670 --> 01:13:14,420
Why didn't you say all this then?

976
01:13:19,008 --> 01:13:20,987
Enough, mom, I had to wrap
my head around the fact

977
01:13:20,987 --> 01:13:23,808
that you and dad don't
accept me for who I am.

978
01:13:23,808 --> 01:13:25,447
That you both keep dropping these hints

979
01:13:25,447 --> 01:13:29,888
that if I change my mind
I can head back home.

980
01:13:29,888 --> 01:13:32,187
Mom, seriously, if you don't
accept me and support me

981
01:13:32,187 --> 01:13:36,987
that's okay, I've accepted it,
it's just who you guys are.

982
01:13:36,987 --> 01:13:40,237
But what are you doing here with Steve?

983
01:13:42,089 --> 01:13:45,224
You happen to like him,
and yes, I do love him but,

984
01:13:45,224 --> 01:13:48,635
please don't for once pretend
that by accepting Steve

985
01:13:48,635 --> 01:13:52,718
and telling me to marry
him you have accepted me.

986
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:58,917
What if you didn't like the
man I fell in love with?

987
01:13:58,917 --> 01:14:02,000
Would you accept and support me then?

988
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:07,179
I'm sorry, mom, this acceptance
of yours is conditional

989
01:14:07,179 --> 01:14:08,299
and if there are conditions

990
01:14:08,299 --> 01:14:11,132
then there's really no acceptance.

991
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:19,367
(sobbing)

992
01:14:21,301 --> 01:14:23,884
(somber music)

993
01:14:35,499 --> 01:14:38,379
- Good, yeah, those juices.

994
01:14:38,379 --> 01:14:39,920
That's perfect.

995
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:43,003
- It's been awhile.
- You're a genius.

996
01:14:43,861 --> 01:14:45,915
- [Aakash] Okay, try this.

997
01:14:45,915 --> 01:14:48,597
- Is it nice?
- I don't know.

998
01:14:48,597 --> 01:14:50,430
Is it?
- Mm, it's nice.

999
01:14:54,779 --> 01:14:58,458
Come on, sleepyhead, your
son's made breakfast.

1000
01:14:58,458 --> 01:15:01,375
- Good morning, mom.
- Good morning.

1001
01:15:05,899 --> 01:15:06,955
- Okay, eat up now.

1002
01:15:06,955 --> 01:15:08,496
The list of everything I
want to show you is long

1003
01:15:08,496 --> 01:15:10,277
and we just have two days, right?

1004
01:15:10,277 --> 01:15:11,595
- Did you make that?

1005
01:15:11,595 --> 01:15:13,035
- Yes, I did.

1006
01:15:13,035 --> 01:15:15,099
- No you didn't, I made it as well.

1007
01:15:15,099 --> 01:15:16,932
- Can I feed you this?

- Mom.

1021
01:17:51,991 --> 01:17:55,611
- Aakash, I wanna say something to you.

1022
01:17:55,611 --> 01:17:58,553
From the moment you were born

1023
01:17:58,553 --> 01:18:02,173
every part of me accepted the way you are.

1024
01:18:02,173 --> 01:18:05,152
I know I've never stood up for you.

1025
01:18:05,152 --> 01:18:08,672
That's because I never
stood up for myself.

1026
01:18:08,672 --> 01:18:10,672
I never accepted myself.

1027
01:18:12,153 --> 01:18:14,553
How can I accept you?

1028
01:18:14,553 --> 01:18:16,886
But now I do, you're my son.

1029
01:18:18,913 --> 01:18:22,996
And you've turned out to
be such a wonderful man.

1030
01:18:24,223 --> 01:18:27,223
And I love you just the way you are.

1031
01:18:30,132 --> 01:18:33,055
But (speaking in foreign
language), you have to be strong.

1032
01:18:33,055 --> 01:18:36,036
I'm your mother, I understand you,

1033
01:18:36,036 --> 01:18:39,455
but you have the entire world to face.

1034
01:18:39,455 --> 01:18:41,372
- You're my world, mom.

1035
01:18:42,335 --> 01:18:44,002
No one else matters.

1036
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:51,455
- Aakash, you better take care of Steve.

1037
01:18:51,455 --> 01:18:53,288
He's my friend now so,

1038
01:18:54,132 --> 01:18:56,130
and I don't want to hear any complaints.

1039
01:18:56,130 --> 01:18:58,530
So take care of him.
- I will.

1040
01:18:58,530 --> 01:19:01,636
- And Steve, you better
take care of Aakash.

1041
01:19:01,636 --> 01:19:04,708
I don't wanna hear any complaints for him.

1042
01:19:04,708 --> 01:19:06,541
Or you know my temper.

1043
01:19:08,632 --> 01:19:09,549
- Ah, Indu.

1044
01:19:10,653 --> 01:19:12,189
I have something for you.

1045
01:19:12,189 --> 01:19:13,022
- Oh?

1046
01:19:14,206 --> 01:19:15,206
What's that?

1047
01:19:19,367 --> 01:19:21,117
- It's a photo album.

1048
01:19:22,610 --> 01:19:24,755
See it when you're alone,

1049
01:19:24,755 --> 01:19:27,293
it's my last photo album.

1050
01:19:27,293 --> 01:19:28,710
Subject is, Indu.

1051
01:19:33,732 --> 01:19:36,157
- So music it is then?

1052
01:19:36,157 --> 01:19:40,942
I should take your autograph
before you become famous.

1053
01:19:40,942 --> 01:19:42,942
I got something for you.

1054
01:19:47,816 --> 01:19:50,733
This is for you.
- Tipping me again?

1055
01:19:50,733 --> 01:19:54,797
- No, this is what I
earned at Simran's hostel.

1056
01:19:54,797 --> 01:19:56,717
I could have given you a thousand bahts,

1057
01:19:56,717 --> 01:19:59,734
but this hundred bahts
is far more precious

1058
01:19:59,734 --> 01:20:03,352
because I earned it for the first time.

1059
01:20:03,352 --> 01:20:07,545
- Can't I have both? (laughs)

1060
01:20:07,545 --> 01:20:10,677
This means a lot to me,
Indu, thank you so much.

1061
01:20:10,677 --> 01:20:11,797
