1
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,399
She is calling you. There's very
little time, please hurry.

2
00:02:06,508 --> 00:02:09,407
As per Ms. Bhavna's will....

3
00:02:09,576 --> 00:02:13,202
...her son, Rahul's inheritance
has been entrusted to you.

4
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,602
Are you her relative?

5
00:02:22,511 --> 00:02:23,909
No.

6
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:26,943
Did you know her since long?

7
00:02:27,112 --> 00:02:29,442
Since the time she was in school.

8
00:02:32,146 --> 00:02:36,977
The inheritance she's left for
her son has been put in a Trust.

9
00:02:37,147 --> 00:02:39,477
Once all the documents are ready,
they will be sent to you.

10
00:02:44,981 --> 00:02:46,879
Where will you
take the child now?

11
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:52,980
Does yourfamily live there...

12
00:02:53,149 --> 00:02:55,479
No. l live alone.

13
00:02:57,184 --> 00:03:00,514
Will you look after a small child
in this old age?

14
00:03:01,617 --> 00:03:02,947
l mean...

15
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:05,973
...doesn't he have a father?

16
00:03:13,286 --> 00:03:16,981
Anyway, once the documents are
ready, we will send them to you.

17
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:42,440
Take him away!
...Mummy! Take him away!

18
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:58,509
-What's the matter?
- Sister, take the dog away!

19
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:04,373
-Who brought it?
- Papa did.

20
00:06:04,545 --> 00:06:07,375
-You're scared of a tiny dog?!
- No way! l'm not scared.

21
00:06:07,545 --> 00:06:09,375
You aren't, right? Now watch!

22
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,879
No! l'll tell mummy!

23
00:06:16,113 --> 00:06:18,375
You aren't scared, right? Look!

24
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:25,413
This point here...
Please let there be light.

25
00:06:25,582 --> 00:06:27,810
You had to provide ramps
from here to this point.

26
00:06:30,049 --> 00:06:32,448
And what are
these proportions! Are you...

27
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,449
Speak softly, my dear.
What's the matter?

28
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,449
What did the dog do?

29
00:06:44,551 --> 00:06:47,949
l'll be home soon.
ls your mummy there?

30
00:06:48,552 --> 00:06:50,484
No? ...Thank God!

31
00:06:50,652 --> 00:06:52,481
And listen! lf she
returns soon, don't tell her.

32
00:06:52,652 --> 00:06:55,982
l'll be there before she does.
...Yes, my dear!

33
00:06:56,587 --> 00:06:58,485
My wife loves dogs, sir.

34
00:06:59,787 --> 00:07:01,276
My wife hates them.

35
00:07:09,488 --> 00:07:12,386
You get dead tired, going out
in this city in the traffic!

36
00:07:12,555 --> 00:07:14,385
l left at 4 O'clock!

37
00:07:15,489 --> 00:07:19,388
Here are your colour pencils.
Don't lose them again.

38
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:24,422
Where has the flower vase gone
from here? Who has removed it?

39
00:07:24,591 --> 00:07:25,989
Abdul, get me some water.

40
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:36,957
-Where has the flower vase gone?
- l don't know.

41
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:39,958
Nobody in this house
ever knows anything!

42
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:42,225
Here are your pencils.

43
00:07:47,561 --> 00:07:50,959
Hey! Who's kept a cactus
in place of the photo frame?

44
00:07:53,562 --> 00:07:57,460
She's always missing!
She's never at home!

45
00:08:01,096 --> 00:08:02,926
Why are all of you
sitting so quietly?

46
00:08:05,964 --> 00:08:09,897
Hear, hear!
Can't we sit quietly at home?

47
00:08:11,498 --> 00:08:14,396
lndeed! l know what it means
when all of you sit quietly!

48
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:20,393
Papa, mummy is going to
the bathroom to wash herface.

49
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:21,725
Oh! We'll be damned!

50
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,396
lndu... uh... are you
going to the bathroom?

51
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,398
What!

52
00:08:28,567 --> 00:08:30,397
Are you going to wash yourface?

53
00:08:30,934 --> 00:08:32,763
-Why?
- For no reason.

54
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:36,434
l've heard that washing the face
too much spoils the skin.

55
00:08:36,603 --> 00:08:38,432
Where did you hearthat?

56
00:08:38,603 --> 00:08:40,432
Well... Mini was saying so.

57
00:08:40,636 --> 00:08:43,033
No, papa! Sister said so.

58
00:08:43,202 --> 00:08:46,465
No! Even l didn't say so! ...
Mummy, l'd heard it on the radio.

59
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:49,468
-Yes! We'd heard it on the radio.
-What's wrong with all of you?!

60
00:08:53,571 --> 00:08:55,469
We are doomed now!

61
00:08:55,638 --> 00:08:56,536
Yes.

62
00:09:06,473 --> 00:09:09,371
Take this dog away!
Who brought it here?!

63
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,371
l said, take the dog away!

64
00:09:13,474 --> 00:09:15,406
Who brought it here?!

65
00:09:16,508 --> 00:09:18,974
l asked, who brought it here?!

66
00:09:23,508 --> 00:09:24,907
Let's go.

67
00:09:25,508 --> 00:09:27,407
l knew it!

68
00:09:27,576 --> 00:09:29,667
- Please let the dog stay here.
- Quiet!

69
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:34,408
The dog broke a photo frame,
a flower vase and tore a curtain!

70
00:09:34,577 --> 00:09:36,975
These were the disasters
struck on the very first day!

71
00:09:37,178 --> 00:09:40,440
lt'll destroy the whole house in
no time! Who'll take care of it?

72
00:09:40,612 --> 00:09:42,441
We'll put a leash around it.

73
00:09:42,612 --> 00:09:45,635
There's no need!
Who asked you to get it?!

74
00:09:46,579 --> 00:09:50,978
Bela is not yet here!
She is always missing!

75
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,474
l'm warning you,
l will not keep the dog!

76
00:09:57,581 --> 00:09:59,479
How often have l said,
throw away those glasses!

77
00:10:00,581 --> 00:10:01,910
Hey! How will l read then!

78
00:10:02,081 --> 00:10:04,480
-You look just like a peon!
- So what?

79
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,515
How's your backache?

80
00:10:12,617 --> 00:10:16,982
lt's okay now but l had to
stand in the site for 2-3 hours.

81
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:18,514
l'll massage it.

82
00:10:20,651 --> 00:10:23,049
Why do you have to work so much?

83
00:10:23,218 --> 00:10:27,548
Come off it! l work for
you and your children.

84
00:10:28,151 --> 00:10:31,550
Stop it! ...
You are fond of working!

85
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,549
We have everything.

86
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,550
Everything is what we don't have.

87
00:10:36,653 --> 00:10:38,052
What do we lack?

88
00:10:38,653 --> 00:10:40,552
A diamond necklace.

89
00:10:40,721 --> 00:10:42,550
Well, who wants one!

90
00:10:42,721 --> 00:10:48,087
Oh really! Then, why were you
lustily eyeing Kanta's necklace?

91
00:10:48,256 --> 00:10:52,087
Nonsense! l was looking at it
because it was so ugly!

92
00:10:52,257 --> 00:10:53,153
l see.

93
00:10:53,689 --> 00:10:58,123
Forget the necklace but you'd
surely want a husband like hers?

94
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:02,118
Get me the most precious gem, yet
l wouldn't want a man like Suri.

95
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,053
What kind of
a husband do you want?

96
00:11:07,591 --> 00:11:09,490
l have one.

97
00:11:09,925 --> 00:11:14,484
Yes, you do. But do sing praises
about him sometimes!

98
00:11:19,627 --> 00:11:21,025
Shall l say something?

99
00:11:22,628 --> 00:11:24,526
Let's keep the puppy at home?

100
00:11:24,694 --> 00:11:26,524
You sly monkey!

101
00:11:28,662 --> 00:11:31,719
Yuck! l'm not going to
drink this! There's cream in it!

102
00:11:32,162 --> 00:11:34,560
Nothing doing! Drink the milk!

103
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,127
Keep your hand down!

104
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:38,558
How will l drink my coffee then?!

105
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:39,991
Use the other hand.

106
00:11:40,163 --> 00:11:41,992
Keep papa's name as puppy.

107
00:11:42,163 --> 00:11:44,152
Stupid! Keep the puppy's
name as papa!

108
00:11:45,264 --> 00:11:47,162
Stop fighting
early in the morning!

109
00:11:47,664 --> 00:11:49,562
-Allow me to take the coffee.
- No!

110
00:11:49,764 --> 00:11:52,095
The puppy drinks milk,
not coffee.

111
00:11:52,265 --> 00:11:55,595
l'm not talking about
the puppy... but about papa.

112
00:11:56,699 --> 00:11:58,597
Shall we name him also Mini?

113
00:12:00,233 --> 00:12:01,596
ls that a name!

114
00:12:02,233 --> 00:12:04,495
Naming him Mini
will create a problem.

115
00:12:04,667 --> 00:12:06,496
lf we call the puppy,
you'll come running...

116
00:12:06,667 --> 00:12:08,998
...and if we call you,
it will come running!

117
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,999
When there will be no dog,
what's the use of finding a name?

118
00:12:14,802 --> 00:12:16,995
Have you had your vitamins?

119
00:12:17,602 --> 00:12:19,000
- Have you?
-Yes, papa.

120
00:12:19,169 --> 00:12:21,498
- l'm asking you also.
-Yes, even l've had it.

121
00:12:22,103 --> 00:12:25,093
Papa, you lie?

122
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:40,070
Don't forget we have to go to
Mr. Suri's party in the evening.

123
00:12:41,672 --> 00:12:45,071
There's a tank
filled with hot water.

124
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:51,071
ln it, your host, his wife
and you are almost naked!

125
00:12:52,674 --> 00:12:56,573
The pressure of the hot water
massages your body!

126
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:58,968
And you get tickled all over.

127
00:13:02,576 --> 00:13:04,474
-Adjust yourtie properly!
-What's wrong with it?

128
00:13:04,643 --> 00:13:05,972
-You've come for a party.
- lt's okay.

129
00:13:06,142 --> 00:13:07,666
Hey, you Late Kate!

130
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:14,109
- Suri, how are you?
-Absolutely fine.

131
00:13:14,277 --> 00:13:17,006
Mr. Suri, DK will not
drink too much today.

132
00:13:17,177 --> 00:13:20,143
- The question does not arise!
- lndeed! He gets high with 2 pegs!

133
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:25,007
And listen... please don't
recite couplets either!

134
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,508
l can't promise that.

135
00:13:27,113 --> 00:13:29,511
All right! But do everything
within your limits, DK!

136
00:13:31,647 --> 00:13:34,046
Let's have a very large peg.

137
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,977
l had no idea that
there'd be so many people.

138
00:13:37,147 --> 00:13:39,046
Bring a glass of
champagne for him.

139
00:13:39,215 --> 00:13:40,612
We'll have a large peg later.

140
00:13:52,683 --> 00:13:54,172
Listen to what l say!

141
00:13:57,684 --> 00:14:02,946
Son, he makes films. Deliver
the dialogues from Sholay'.

142
00:14:03,585 --> 00:14:06,484
''How many men were there?''
''Two, sir.''

143
00:14:06,652 --> 00:14:09,483
''And you were three.
Yet, you returned empty-handed!''

144
00:14:09,653 --> 00:14:11,050
He's good, isn't he?

145
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,518
You were to phone me
day before yesterday!

146
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:17,516
l was busy, l had to go out.

147
00:14:17,687 --> 00:14:20,017
You are always busy
with your work!

148
00:14:20,187 --> 00:14:22,517
You were going to
quit smoking, weren't you?

149
00:14:22,688 --> 00:14:25,017
- From tomorrow.
- Tomorrow indeed!

150
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:38,021
Hadn't you worn the
same one for Sheetal's party?

151
00:14:38,224 --> 00:14:39,553
They are very beautiful.

152
00:14:39,723 --> 00:14:41,553
- Hasn't Ratna come?
- l did call her.

153
00:14:41,724 --> 00:14:44,054
But you know her condition.

154
00:14:44,225 --> 00:14:47,555
ldiot! She keeps crying, and that
too away from her husband's eyes.

155
00:14:47,758 --> 00:14:49,554
She doesn't protest by
eitherfighting or crying!

156
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:50,747
Meaning?

157
00:15:03,061 --> 00:15:07,959
Remember, DK, in those days,
your athleticism...

158
00:15:09,062 --> 00:15:10,994
And my naughtiness...

159
00:15:12,095 --> 00:15:13,492
How many girls went crazy!

160
00:15:15,096 --> 00:15:16,994
Any letters from the Major?

161
00:15:17,263 --> 00:15:19,490
lt's a thing of the past.
Forget it!

162
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,096
Have you forgotten?

163
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:27,524
Why do you worry?
Don't l look fine?

164
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:34,027
''Raise not your hands
and arch backwards''

165
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:39,029
''Take a look at your bosom''

166
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,098
''As slowly
slides down your veil''

167
00:15:41,267 --> 00:15:42,732
Wow! What a couplet!

168
00:15:45,167 --> 00:15:48,531
Remember, there was a song...

169
00:15:49,669 --> 00:15:56,067
''O' lovely maiden, walk not
with your nose in the air''

170
00:15:57,703 --> 00:15:59,601
Should we sing?

171
00:16:00,202 --> 00:16:01,600
Will you sing?

172
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:11,969
l have a bad throat.
Why don't you begin?

173
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:14,468
- Putting up your price, huh?
- No way!

174
00:16:17,606 --> 00:16:19,504
You start, l'll join you.

175
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,004
What are you doing!

176
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:39,646
- How is Ratna now?
- l don't know.

177
00:22:00,424 --> 00:22:01,685
Lie straight.

178
00:22:04,192 --> 00:22:05,590
No, Ratna, don't cry.

179
00:22:14,692 --> 00:22:18,591
Was your problem solved by
swallowing sleeping pills? ...No!

180
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,591
You should have given them
to your husband instead!

181
00:22:21,761 --> 00:22:24,591
Orto his mistress!

182
00:22:24,794 --> 00:22:26,623
What will you gain by dying?!

183
00:22:26,794 --> 00:22:30,250
Quiet, Chanda! ls this
the time to scold her?!

184
00:22:37,963 --> 00:22:39,623
You're here?

185
00:22:40,763 --> 00:22:42,162
What have you come to take now?!

186
00:22:44,764 --> 00:22:47,196
You've put Ratna in this state!
What more do you want to do?!

187
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:49,263
- Please be quiet, Chanda.
-Why should l?!

188
00:22:49,398 --> 00:22:51,160
Somebody has to speak!

189
00:22:51,332 --> 00:22:54,163
Should everyone be quiet like her
and let this man do as he please?

190
00:22:54,332 --> 00:22:56,162
Let's go... We'll leave now.

191
00:23:02,034 --> 00:23:04,057
Think and talk!

192
00:23:04,234 --> 00:23:07,564
lf you were in her shoes,
would you think and talk?!

193
00:23:11,701 --> 00:23:14,600
Sleeping pills
do not solve problems.

194
00:23:15,702 --> 00:23:18,100
But her husband is also crazy.

195
00:23:18,269 --> 00:23:20,599
How can he change,
even after having children?

196
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:24,596
lf you can't bearthe
responsibility, why get married?

197
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:30,103
Mummy, if l were not born,
what would have happened?

198
00:23:31,738 --> 00:23:34,637
Then there would have been
a baby boy in your place!

199
00:23:34,805 --> 00:23:35,793
My brother.

200
00:23:36,239 --> 00:23:39,602
- Not yours but mine!
- He'd have been my brothertoo.

201
00:23:39,805 --> 00:23:42,272
How would he, stupid!
You wouldn't be born!

202
00:23:44,774 --> 00:23:47,104
Don't! Does one talk this way
with an elder sister?

203
00:23:47,274 --> 00:23:49,172
Does one speak this way
with a younger sister?

204
00:23:49,341 --> 00:23:51,170
l'll beat you!
You call me stupid!

205
00:23:55,775 --> 00:23:57,173
Hey, you'll fall!

206
00:23:58,776 --> 00:24:00,674
That's enough now!

207
00:24:02,642 --> 00:24:05,575
Go to your room.

208
00:24:12,678 --> 00:24:15,110
lndu, suppose you
had a baby boy, then?

209
00:24:16,711 --> 00:24:18,109
l have one.

210
00:24:18,712 --> 00:24:21,611
Where is he?
Have you hidden him?

211
00:24:22,712 --> 00:24:26,110
Here he is!
lsn't he enough for me?

212
00:24:31,714 --> 00:24:32,873
Why?

213
00:24:35,215 --> 00:24:38,613
You have one, l don't.

214
00:24:39,749 --> 00:24:45,614
You don't even tell me whether
l've received a reply or not.

215
00:24:45,816 --> 00:24:48,646
lf there was, then l'd have
come to you immediately.

216
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:51,180
Why do you worry when l'm around?

217
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:55,182
Worried, l certainly am.

218
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:59,182
About this boy.
After all, l'm getting older.

219
00:24:59,351 --> 00:25:02,545
Here, send him
a telegram this time.

220
00:25:03,652 --> 00:25:06,050
Get yourself treated properly.

221
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:09,050
- ls there a cure for old age?
-Why do you talk like this...

222
00:25:09,253 --> 00:25:12,084
Go and send
a telegram immediately.

223
00:25:26,223 --> 00:25:28,621
- There's a telegram.
- From whom?

224
00:25:33,123 --> 00:25:34,613
From Nainital?

225
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:37,120
He's asked you to come at once,
as there's some important work.

226
00:25:40,225 --> 00:25:43,157
-Who is he?
- The headmaster of my old school.

227
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,157
-Anything important?
- l don't know.

228
00:25:49,326 --> 00:25:50,656
He has never before...

229
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,158
- l haven't met him since years.
- Then?

230
00:25:55,793 --> 00:25:57,191
l'll phone him from office.

231
00:26:14,163 --> 00:26:15,560
Gupta, check this.

232
00:26:17,197 --> 00:26:18,594
Bring it in.

233
00:26:28,732 --> 00:26:30,129
Mr. Dhawan is waiting foryou.

234
00:26:30,298 --> 00:26:32,128
- ls the new client here?
-Yes.

235
00:26:32,298 --> 00:26:34,128
-What's his name?
- Mr. Bansal.

236
00:26:35,732 --> 00:26:39,222
Listen... get me a trunk call
to Nainital. This is the number.

237
00:26:49,235 --> 00:26:51,168
And this is the embassy.

238
00:26:51,336 --> 00:26:55,166
And yes! This is Neelkamal
Building, of which you mentioned.

239
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:58,668
These are its schematic designs.

240
00:27:00,803 --> 00:27:03,565
Come, DK. We were waiting
foryou... This is Mr. Bansal.

241
00:27:05,671 --> 00:27:07,068
Please sit, DK.

242
00:27:11,305 --> 00:27:16,067
He wants to build a complex -
Bansal Bhavan... is that the name?

243
00:27:16,672 --> 00:27:19,070
He wants us
to give him a proposal.

244
00:27:19,673 --> 00:27:22,070
You will be giving
the first presentation.

245
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,104
l was showing him the schematic
designs of Neelkamal Building.

246
00:27:26,707 --> 00:27:28,606
-You explain to him.
- Sure.

247
00:27:31,208 --> 00:27:33,606
No. Mr. Gurudayal has retired.

248
00:27:33,776 --> 00:27:36,640
- Please give me his phone number.
- He doesn't have a phone.

249
00:27:36,809 --> 00:27:38,604
Who's speaking?

250
00:27:38,742 --> 00:27:41,641
DK from Delhi. l've received
a telegram from Mr. Gurudayal.

251
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:44,640
-Are you DK Malhotra?
-Yes. Who are you?

252
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:46,639
My name is Tiwari.

253
00:27:47,244 --> 00:27:51,143
l had sent you the telegram.
The master had sent a lettertoo.

254
00:27:51,311 --> 00:27:53,140
- l haven't received the letter.
-You haven't?

255
00:27:53,311 --> 00:27:56,641
But l did get his telegram.
Mr. Tiwari, what work did he have?

256
00:27:56,845 --> 00:27:58,141
lt's something very personal...

257
00:27:59,446 --> 00:28:03,173
-What work did he have?
-Are you really DK Malhotra?

258
00:28:04,147 --> 00:28:07,511
Yes, l am DK speaking!
What work did he have?

259
00:28:07,747 --> 00:28:10,077
He's asked you to come
to Nainital. Your son...

260
00:28:13,181 --> 00:28:15,147
What did the master say?

261
00:28:15,681 --> 00:28:18,170
He says he has
very little time, and...

262
00:28:18,349 --> 00:28:20,577
All right! But what
work does he have with me?

263
00:28:20,748 --> 00:28:23,772
He wants you to take away
your son from here.

264
00:28:24,683 --> 00:28:25,773
Son!

265
00:28:26,683 --> 00:28:28,081
Whose son?

266
00:28:29,683 --> 00:28:32,616
l have no son.
What are you talking about?!

267
00:28:42,086 --> 00:28:44,109
Hello, Mr. Tiwari?!

268
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:48,649
What is the matter? Do you know
what else the master has said?

269
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,877
Yes. A small boy
lives in his house.

270
00:28:51,253 --> 00:28:53,651
Since the time his mother
left him with the master...

271
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:56,151
Hello! Who's left him?

272
00:28:56,321 --> 00:28:58,150
His mother - Bhavna.

273
00:29:03,155 --> 00:29:04,554
l see.

274
00:29:07,057 --> 00:29:08,522
Yes, Mr. Tiwari? ...

275
00:29:29,692 --> 00:29:32,090
-Worked up about something?
- No.

276
00:29:35,693 --> 00:29:37,625
Did you phone Nainital?

277
00:29:37,794 --> 00:29:42,625
Yes. The master was not there but
l spoke to a man named Mr. Tiwari.

278
00:29:42,795 --> 00:29:44,193
lndu, he said...

279
00:29:49,762 --> 00:29:51,160
What did he say?

280
00:29:51,762 --> 00:29:54,661
He said that
the master was unwell...

281
00:29:55,264 --> 00:29:57,662
The line was bad,
l couldn't hear properly.

282
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:01,661
But he did say that
the master was unwell.

283
00:30:01,831 --> 00:30:03,661
Send him some money
for his treatment.

284
00:30:03,832 --> 00:30:06,662
- lndu, that's not all.
- Then what is it?

285
00:30:10,065 --> 00:30:12,055
l have some problem.

286
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,665
What is that problem
of yours which isn't mine?

287
00:30:25,835 --> 00:30:27,300
What is it?

288
00:30:28,835 --> 00:30:30,232
Nothing.

289
00:30:31,836 --> 00:30:33,734
lt's an office problem.

290
00:30:51,372 --> 00:30:53,270
- lt's me.
-Yes, lndu?

291
00:30:53,472 --> 00:30:55,268
There's a letterfrom Nainital.
Shall l read it?

292
00:30:55,472 --> 00:30:58,802
- Have you read it?
- No. l've not even opened it.

293
00:30:58,972 --> 00:31:00,802
- Shall l open it?
- No, don't.

294
00:31:01,406 --> 00:31:04,668
l'll come home in the evening
and read it. Okay?

295
00:31:05,774 --> 00:31:10,672
Or l'll send the office peon.
Give it to him.

296
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,708
Anita, cancel all appointments.

297
00:31:43,346 --> 00:31:48,746
''DK, she never wanted you
to know about this child.''

298
00:31:48,915 --> 00:31:52,278
''When l learnt about it
afterthe child was born...

299
00:31:52,448 --> 00:31:55,278
...Bhavna had said
just one thing.''

300
00:31:55,448 --> 00:32:00,780
''Do not tell DK, since he has
his own life... his own family.'''

301
00:32:07,284 --> 00:32:10,182
''That child
neither laughs nor cries.''

302
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:13,680
''He keeps staring out
of the window all day long.''

303
00:32:13,851 --> 00:32:15,749
''Waiting for, l wonder, whom.''

304
00:32:15,918 --> 00:32:20,180
''lt appears as if his childhood
is vanishing at such a young age.''

305
00:32:20,351 --> 00:32:23,182
''l cannot give him anything
in my old age.''

306
00:32:23,386 --> 00:32:29,217
''He needs a mother,
a father... a family, DK.''

307
00:32:29,387 --> 00:32:35,514
''He asks me questions whose
answers l can't give, you can.''

308
00:32:42,055 --> 00:32:45,250
''Son, l won't live
very long now.''

309
00:32:45,423 --> 00:32:49,253
''Before l die, l want
to send your son to you.''

310
00:33:07,993 --> 00:33:10,050
Mummy, shout at her!

311
00:33:10,793 --> 00:33:12,190
Stupid, shut it!

312
00:33:12,793 --> 00:33:15,191
You stupid! They are
showing Chintu's songs!

313
00:33:16,793 --> 00:33:19,192
- Mummy, ask herto shut it!
- Concentrate here!

314
00:33:19,794 --> 00:33:21,351
What to do about this?

315
00:33:21,795 --> 00:33:24,693
- Make blocks of these sums.
- How do you do that?

316
00:33:24,862 --> 00:33:27,192
That's what l don't know,
so l'm asking you.

317
00:33:27,362 --> 00:33:29,191
O God! Your New Math is tough!

318
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:31,193
Mini, stop your chorus!

319
00:33:31,396 --> 00:33:33,727
They are showing Chintu's songs.

320
00:33:33,896 --> 00:33:35,726
ls Chintu your uncle?!

321
00:33:37,831 --> 00:33:39,161
Shut it!

322
00:33:39,331 --> 00:33:41,263
Mummy, please! They're showing
Uncle Chintu's songs!

323
00:33:41,431 --> 00:33:42,726
lt's disturbing.

324
00:33:42,931 --> 00:33:45,261
Forget that.
Mummy, first tell me...

325
00:33:45,865 --> 00:33:47,263
Stop it, Mini!

326
00:33:47,432 --> 00:33:50,761
Mummy, l stand first in all the
other subjects except Maths...

327
00:33:53,866 --> 00:33:55,264
Papa, you're here!

328
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:58,763
Papa, they were showing Uncle
Chintu's songs but mummy shut it!

329
00:33:58,934 --> 00:34:00,763
Who's Uncle Chintu?

330
00:34:00,934 --> 00:34:03,628
Damn! How many times have l
told you about Uncle Chintu!

331
00:34:03,835 --> 00:34:07,666
Quiet! ...Papa, ljust
cannot solve this sum.

332
00:34:07,835 --> 00:34:09,165
Ask mummy.

333
00:34:09,335 --> 00:34:12,666
She doesn't know.
You explain, papa.

334
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:17,200
No way! Thank God, you've come.
You handle them!

335
00:34:18,304 --> 00:34:20,702
-Will you have tea?
-Yes. - Papa, please explain!

336
00:34:20,871 --> 00:34:23,701
-Add little sugar.
- Papa, solve the sum first.

337
00:34:23,871 --> 00:34:24,700
Fine.

338
00:34:28,004 --> 00:34:30,198
Doing Winky's homework
is beyond me.

339
00:34:30,805 --> 00:34:32,704
ln any case, l was weak in Math.

340
00:34:32,873 --> 00:34:35,703
And l don't know about these new
blocks to be made in New Math.

341
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:37,702
From now on, you manage her.

342
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:43,204
lf that fatso stands first in
class, Winky will not forgive me!

343
00:34:43,841 --> 00:34:45,238
Get up!

344
00:34:46,842 --> 00:34:48,774
Won't you change your clothes?

345
00:34:52,876 --> 00:34:54,774
l want to tell you something.

346
00:34:56,142 --> 00:34:57,369
Go ahead.

347
00:34:59,876 --> 00:35:01,842
You won't like it.

348
00:35:04,743 --> 00:35:05,834
What's it?

349
00:35:06,744 --> 00:35:09,835
Let it be.
l'll tell you some othertime.

350
00:35:11,778 --> 00:35:13,176
lt's nothing.

351
00:35:13,345 --> 00:35:15,674
Please, DK! Don't say this.

352
00:35:23,813 --> 00:35:25,211
What is it?

353
00:35:31,814 --> 00:35:33,713
There was another girl in my life.

354
00:35:39,316 --> 00:35:42,714
- Don't joke about such matters.
- l am not joking, lndu.

355
00:35:50,851 --> 00:35:52,749
l am not joking.

356
00:35:59,385 --> 00:36:02,647
When l... had gone... there...

357
00:36:03,752 --> 00:36:06,150
-Where?
- To Nainital.

358
00:36:06,752 --> 00:36:09,651
Forthe school's
Old Boys' function...

359
00:36:10,753 --> 00:36:12,152
At that time...

360
00:36:12,954 --> 00:36:15,648
...Winky was going to be born.

361
00:36:16,021 --> 00:36:16,918
Yes.

362
00:36:19,789 --> 00:36:22,687
l'd met herthere.

363
00:36:24,789 --> 00:36:26,017
Who?

364
00:36:26,822 --> 00:36:29,880
Bhavna... that girl.

365
00:36:34,823 --> 00:36:35,721
l...

366
00:36:36,824 --> 00:36:40,722
l don't know...
how l couldn't control myself.

367
00:36:41,825 --> 00:36:46,723
Perhaps because l was alone,
and... so was she.

368
00:36:47,826 --> 00:36:50,224
l went to her house once and...

369
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:54,259
...at her insistence,
l stayed back at night.

370
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:58,726
l shouldn't have stayed back...
l shouldn't have stayed but...

371
00:37:08,263 --> 00:37:11,161
l never ever saw her
afterthat... l swear!

372
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:15,160
And even then, l shared
nothing special with her.

373
00:37:15,763 --> 00:37:17,661
You shared nothing special?!

374
00:37:21,764 --> 00:37:24,162
What can be more special
than this, DK?

375
00:37:29,999 --> 00:37:33,488
So, what does she want now?

376
00:37:33,833 --> 00:37:36,026
Nothing. She's dead.

377
00:37:40,834 --> 00:37:41,925
Then?

378
00:37:47,335 --> 00:37:49,733
She has a son from me.

379
00:37:52,836 --> 00:37:55,927
No! Don't say that!

380
00:37:56,871 --> 00:38:00,735
What's happening!
Please don't say that!

381
00:38:03,737 --> 00:38:06,135
l'm very scared.

382
00:38:18,773 --> 00:38:21,672
Winky dear, go and sleep.

383
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:34,115
You said you've been busy.
So what brings you here today?

384
00:39:34,285 --> 00:39:36,183
l want to talk to you...
There's a big problem.

385
00:39:36,385 --> 00:39:42,216
With Bansal? lf you want, l'll
phone him now and fix matters.

386
00:39:42,819 --> 00:39:45,217
- No. Listen to me.
- Tell me something.

387
00:39:46,853 --> 00:39:49,752
lf your company acquires that
contract, what'll be your share?

388
00:39:49,921 --> 00:39:51,750
- That's not the problem.
- Then?

389
00:39:51,921 --> 00:39:53,750
- lt's something else.
- Then, let's solve the problem!

390
00:39:53,921 --> 00:39:55,750
Mr. Suri, how was the game?

391
00:39:55,921 --> 00:40:00,753
Please don't joke. Doing business
and drinking whisky is my forte.

392
00:40:00,922 --> 00:40:03,252
Else, even l would be preparing
for Wimbledon like my son!

393
00:40:05,422 --> 00:40:09,753
DK, the joy of
watching your son grow!

394
00:40:10,891 --> 00:40:12,948
lt wasn't the same
even in my youth!

395
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:17,784
A son is important.

396
00:40:17,958 --> 00:40:21,287
Your son must be handling
your business now, right?

397
00:40:21,491 --> 00:40:22,788
l'll leave now.

398
00:40:22,993 --> 00:40:25,823
Hey, you wanted to discuss
a problem. What is it?

399
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:29,824
-What's it?
-We'll talk later.

400
00:40:49,463 --> 00:40:51,362
Yes, l will inform him.

401
00:41:05,865 --> 00:41:08,263
Mr. Bansal, this is
a foundation problem.

402
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:10,762
As per Mr. Malhotra's
original estimates...

403
00:41:10,933 --> 00:41:13,763
...you'll find mica content
at a depth of 40 feet.

404
00:41:13,933 --> 00:41:15,263
But as perthe...

405
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,798
Sorry, sir.
l have to go home.

406
00:41:41,938 --> 00:41:43,836
- lndu, where are you going?
-Anywhere! ...l don't know!

407
00:41:44,005 --> 00:41:45,835
Please listen to me!

408
00:41:46,006 --> 00:41:47,335
l don't want to listen!

409
00:41:47,939 --> 00:41:50,336
Please listen to me for a minute!

410
00:41:55,973 --> 00:41:57,871
l didn't know that the boy
was going to come here.

411
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,870
- Stop lying!
- l swear, l didn't know!

412
00:42:01,007 --> 00:42:03,735
Come what may, that boy is
not going to come to this house!

413
00:42:03,941 --> 00:42:06,771
- Do you need the taxi or not?
-We don't want it!

414
00:42:11,875 --> 00:42:13,273
Take this.

415
00:42:15,543 --> 00:42:17,771
lndu, listen!
Just for a few days!

416
00:42:17,943 --> 00:42:20,273
Please, lndu! What can l
do now if he's coming here?

417
00:42:20,443 --> 00:42:22,273
Do what you want, but he
is not going to come here!

418
00:42:22,444 --> 00:42:26,308
l promise he won't stay here
for more than 2-3 days.

419
00:42:26,478 --> 00:42:27,808
l promise.

420
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:30,035
l do not trust you anymore!

421
00:42:32,412 --> 00:42:36,845
You'd said, my problem is yours
too. Won't you help me this time?

422
00:42:37,445 --> 00:42:40,843
Mummy, ask sisterto return
my scented rubber!

423
00:42:41,013 --> 00:42:43,946
Quiet! lt was my rubber!
So what if l took it?!

424
00:42:44,147 --> 00:42:47,341
What do you want?! That you
do any wrong and l endure it?!

425
00:42:47,514 --> 00:42:51,344
l'm also human, l have feelings.
Have you everthought about that?

426
00:42:51,948 --> 00:42:54,847
And these children...
what will you tell them?!

427
00:42:55,015 --> 00:42:57,038
l'll beat you! ...
Mummy, just look at her!

428
00:42:57,248 --> 00:43:00,841
Mummy, two of my sums were
wrong!

429
00:43:00,983 --> 00:43:04,143
Come on, l'll show you.

430
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:07,248
Come on, mummy!

431
00:43:09,484 --> 00:43:12,144
Papa, please carry me.

432
00:43:17,085 --> 00:43:19,778
Now take me inside.

433
00:43:26,887 --> 00:43:28,785
Mini and Winky, please come here.

434
00:43:29,887 --> 00:43:31,319
What's it?

435
00:43:31,921 --> 00:43:34,820
A boy will be coming
to stay in our house.

436
00:43:34,988 --> 00:43:37,113
-Who is he?
- His name is...

437
00:43:40,956 --> 00:43:45,355
His mummy is dead,
so he's coming to stay with us.

438
00:43:45,522 --> 00:43:47,353
But who was his mummy?

439
00:43:49,457 --> 00:43:52,855
She was our distant relative.

440
00:43:53,025 --> 00:43:55,253
Mummy, how old is he?

441
00:43:55,958 --> 00:43:57,356
He...

442
00:44:02,825 --> 00:44:04,757
He is 8-9 years old.

443
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:10,224
Such a small boy! My exams are
nearing, he won't let me study!

444
00:44:10,426 --> 00:44:12,256
No. He'll play with me.

445
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:15,757
Where is his father?
Why doesn't he go to him?

446
00:44:16,894 --> 00:44:19,793
His father has gone away.

447
00:44:20,395 --> 00:44:21,793
Leaving him behind?

448
00:44:25,095 --> 00:44:27,289
My papa would have
never done that!

449
00:44:27,462 --> 00:44:30,292
Children, go to
your room and sleep.

450
00:44:37,531 --> 00:44:39,827
- Come on, hurry.
- lt will be great fun now!

451
00:44:39,998 --> 00:44:41,328
lt will be no fun!

452
00:44:43,933 --> 00:44:45,330
You took care.

453
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:48,865
l was taking care of my children!

454
00:45:29,905 --> 00:45:31,599
Shall l roll the window down?

455
00:46:04,844 --> 00:46:06,742
Look, that's the Old Fort.

456
00:46:07,844 --> 00:46:12,539
lt's a... very old... fort!

457
00:46:13,845 --> 00:46:17,142
lt was built by Sher Shah Suri
...or perhaps Humayun...

458
00:46:17,346 --> 00:46:21,245
There's a big zoo inside now.
There are many animals and a...

459
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:23,277
Did you know my mummy?

460
00:46:25,881 --> 00:46:27,779
Y... y... yes. Yes, l did know her.

461
00:46:27,981 --> 00:46:29,379
And papa?

462
00:46:30,915 --> 00:46:33,608
Not papa.

463
00:46:37,417 --> 00:46:41,315
Mummy used to say that
l'll surely find my papa.

464
00:46:41,916 --> 00:46:46,815
Even mummy is no more. lf papa
does come, how will he find me?

465
00:46:47,917 --> 00:46:51,815
He will, son... he will find you.

466
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:05,251
Mini, he is Rahul.

467
00:47:08,454 --> 00:47:10,249
Winky dear, come here.

468
00:47:11,521 --> 00:47:14,249
Rahul, she is Winky.

469
00:47:16,855 --> 00:47:19,754
She is my mummy...
Mummy, he is Rahul.

470
00:47:26,156 --> 00:47:29,248
Will Rahul sleep in my room?

471
00:47:29,457 --> 00:47:31,389
No. His bed has been
put in the study.

472
00:47:31,891 --> 00:47:34,288
But l study there.

473
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:37,821
My dear, it's a matter
of only a few days.

474
00:47:38,925 --> 00:47:41,824
Abdul, keep his baggage
in the study.

475
00:47:48,926 --> 00:47:51,324
Both of you come upstairs.

476
00:48:10,264 --> 00:48:13,718
Get up, this is my place.
l sit with papa.

477
00:48:17,864 --> 00:48:19,262
Go and sit there.

478
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:36,764
Abdul... has not brought the rice.

479
00:49:02,304 --> 00:49:05,169
l had a puppy
whose name was also Mini.

480
00:49:05,338 --> 00:49:06,737
Eat quietly, Mini.

481
00:49:06,906 --> 00:49:08,872
When papa used to call
the puppy, l'd come running.

482
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:12,206
And when he'd call me,
the puppy would come running.

483
00:49:14,273 --> 00:49:16,535
Mummy is upset today.

484
00:49:31,875 --> 00:49:33,773
lndu, aren't you going to eat?

485
00:54:26,988 --> 00:54:28,078
Son.

486
00:54:34,989 --> 00:54:36,887
What are you
doing all alone here?

487
00:54:37,089 --> 00:54:38,918
Gazing at the stars.

488
00:54:40,523 --> 00:54:44,387
Mummy used to say that
if you see a shooting star...

489
00:54:44,590 --> 00:54:46,921
...your wish gets fulfilled.

490
00:54:50,557 --> 00:54:52,456
Look, uncle, a shooting star!

491
00:54:53,058 --> 00:54:55,116
-Where is it?
- lt's disappeared.

492
00:54:55,858 --> 00:54:57,950
- Did you wish for something?
-Yes.

493
00:54:58,259 --> 00:55:00,316
-What?
- l can't tell you.

494
00:55:01,426 --> 00:55:02,323
Why?

495
00:55:07,526 --> 00:55:10,322
l see... Should we go inside?

496
00:55:16,962 --> 00:55:17,859
Yes?

497
00:55:18,161 --> 00:55:20,458
Shall l tell you
what l wished for?

498
00:55:23,995 --> 00:55:27,894
l prayed that l'd find my papa.

499
00:55:35,598 --> 00:55:37,690
Come on, papa, it's getting late.

500
00:55:37,997 --> 00:55:40,896
Papa, come on.
lt's getting very late.

501
00:55:41,065 --> 00:55:42,463
He's taking so long.

502
00:55:53,567 --> 00:55:55,465
The children are getting late.

503
00:56:11,437 --> 00:56:13,335
Did you know my mummy?

504
00:56:15,937 --> 00:56:17,335
No!

505
00:56:21,972 --> 00:56:23,665
But uncle knew her.

506
00:56:24,471 --> 00:56:25,870
l know!

507
00:56:45,008 --> 00:56:46,906
What is it? Why are you
looking at me that way?

508
00:56:47,509 --> 00:56:51,408
Even my mummy used to wear
a similarfloral print sari.

509
00:56:53,043 --> 00:56:55,942
Fine... Let me work now.

510
00:57:06,445 --> 00:57:08,843
And how have you let
that boy stay in your house?!

511
00:57:10,946 --> 00:57:14,343
l haven't. He just came home.

512
00:57:15,946 --> 00:57:17,844
What could l do?

513
00:57:18,947 --> 00:57:24,642
Whenever l see him,
l think of DK and that girl.

514
00:57:25,981 --> 00:57:30,347
Chanda, it seems as if
all relationships are a farce.

515
00:57:32,482 --> 00:57:33,880
lt seems as if...

516
00:57:36,016 --> 00:57:39,312
...such incidents occur
only in other people's lives.

517
00:57:45,018 --> 00:57:47,314
l don't know what to do now.

518
00:58:10,954 --> 00:58:14,853
lndu, the weakeryou become,
the more you will have to endure.

519
00:58:18,956 --> 00:58:20,649
Yes, l'll be there.

520
00:58:21,956 --> 00:58:23,354
l'll be back in a jiffy.

521
00:58:42,026 --> 00:58:46,925
When the Major left me,
even l'd felt defeated like you.

522
00:58:47,094 --> 00:58:49,424
But look at me now.
What do l lack?

523
00:58:49,594 --> 00:58:54,424
l work, l live for myself,
...the way l want to!

524
00:58:55,028 --> 00:58:56,926
Like a free woman.

525
00:58:59,228 --> 00:59:02,592
And don't you miss your son?

526
00:59:09,931 --> 00:59:11,328
5+...

527
00:59:11,497 --> 00:59:14,827
- Shall l recite a poetry foryou?
- No need! l'm studying!

528
00:59:15,964 --> 00:59:17,863
l said, l'm studying!

529
00:59:18,032 --> 00:59:21,362
''Who created
the sparrows that fly?''

530
00:59:22,232 --> 00:59:24,460
-All right, l'll go.
- l'll beat you!

531
00:59:26,966 --> 00:59:28,864
Brother Rahul.

532
00:59:29,966 --> 00:59:32,126
Shall l recite a poetry foryou?

533
00:59:32,966 --> 00:59:34,365
Yes, please.

534
00:59:38,202 --> 00:59:43,396
''Who created
the sparrows that fly?''

535
00:59:45,502 --> 00:59:50,435
''Who created you and me?''

536
00:59:53,036 --> 00:59:56,435
''The Lord is present in everything''

537
01:00:01,038 --> 01:00:02,937
Whose picture is this?

538
01:00:03,105 --> 01:00:04,503
My papa's.

539
01:00:05,238 --> 01:00:06,932
ls this how your papa looks?

540
01:00:07,105 --> 01:00:09,936
l don't know.
Perhaps this is how he looks.

541
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:11,538
Where's he?

542
01:00:16,074 --> 01:00:17,472
He must be dead.

543
01:00:17,641 --> 01:00:21,471
No! Mummy used to say that
he has gone very far away.

544
01:00:21,674 --> 01:00:23,573
And that he'd
surely return someday.

545
01:00:23,741 --> 01:00:29,504
l'd seen another child's father
go somewhere far away, on TV.

546
01:00:29,675 --> 01:00:32,506
His mummy too had said that
his father would return.

547
01:00:32,676 --> 01:00:35,608
But he was dead.
And the boy didn't even know!

548
01:00:36,110 --> 01:00:38,008
Films are not reality.

549
01:00:38,610 --> 01:00:41,008
Yes, indeed. They are films.

550
01:00:41,178 --> 01:00:43,803
l'll tell papa.
He'll find yourfather.

551
01:00:44,144 --> 01:00:45,542
How will he find him?

552
01:00:48,145 --> 01:00:51,510
My papa is very clever.
Watch, he will find yourfather!

553
01:00:51,679 --> 01:00:53,611
Mini! ...What are you doing here?

554
01:00:54,146 --> 01:00:56,078
Playing with Brother Rahul.

555
01:00:56,246 --> 01:00:57,643
Go and sleep.

556
01:01:01,047 --> 01:01:02,946
Since when did Rahul
become your brother?!

557
01:01:09,048 --> 01:01:10,947
What's that you're swallowing?

558
01:01:11,116 --> 01:01:12,445
Sleeping pills.

559
01:01:16,583 --> 01:01:18,981
Will taking sleeping pills
solve anything?

560
01:01:23,085 --> 01:01:25,483
How often have
l apologised to you!

561
01:01:27,085 --> 01:01:30,017
How often have l admitted
that l've indeed made a mistake!

562
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:32,516
Can't you forget it?

563
01:01:34,119 --> 01:01:35,517
How can l?

564
01:01:36,119 --> 01:01:38,449
l was leading a farcical
relationship for 1 0 years!

565
01:01:38,619 --> 01:01:40,812
You cheated me for 1 0 years!

566
01:01:42,121 --> 01:01:44,518
You call
this relationship a farce?!

567
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:49,018
Are you calling those
two children a farce?

568
01:01:50,122 --> 01:01:52,553
- lf our children are...
- Even she had a child.

569
01:01:53,155 --> 01:01:55,053
Will you call that a farce?

570
01:02:01,457 --> 01:02:06,913
Believe me, l was totally
ignorant about this child.

571
01:02:08,058 --> 01:02:10,456
- lf l had known...
-What would you have done then?!

572
01:02:11,558 --> 01:02:12,956
Left us?!

573
01:02:15,058 --> 01:02:16,956
Don't touch me!

574
01:02:37,628 --> 01:02:41,026
Hello. ls that
Mr. DK Malhotra speaking?

575
01:02:41,629 --> 01:02:43,026
My name is...

576
01:02:45,130 --> 01:02:47,028
Hey, l'm Suri here.

577
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:50,026
You've become very lazy!
Do you know it's Sunday today?

578
01:02:50,198 --> 01:02:53,631
Do you have to visit sites today?
Aren't you coming to the farm?

579
01:02:54,131 --> 01:02:58,030
No, Suri. l can't come.
l am not in the mood.

580
01:02:58,666 --> 01:03:01,894
Not in the mood?
l'll take care of your mood!

581
01:03:04,033 --> 01:03:06,727
Suri, listen! l think
even lndu isn't in the mood.

582
01:03:07,333 --> 01:03:11,164
Are you lndu's uncle?!
Give the line to her.

583
01:03:12,067 --> 01:03:15,966
Well, Mr. Moody? Moods become
all right when with friends.

584
01:03:17,468 --> 01:03:20,458
Come, Brother Rahul.
...Come on.

585
01:03:22,569 --> 01:03:24,967
Hello, Uncle Suri!
How are you?

586
01:03:26,069 --> 01:03:28,467
Hello, child!
How were your exams?

587
01:03:28,636 --> 01:03:29,966
They haven't begun as yet.

588
01:03:30,170 --> 01:03:32,500
Hey! Whose cute child is this?

589
01:03:33,105 --> 01:03:35,003
My word! He is so sweet!

590
01:03:35,171 --> 01:03:36,568
Whose son is he?

591
01:03:38,605 --> 01:03:40,002
Well, who is he?

592
01:03:40,772 --> 01:03:45,398
He's Brother Rahul. His mother is
dead and his papa has gone away.

593
01:04:00,808 --> 01:04:02,706
Why didn't you come
for Chulbul's party?

594
01:04:06,042 --> 01:04:07,338
- Don't hit the plants!
-Why not?

595
01:04:07,542 --> 01:04:09,532
They belong to my father!
l will break them!

596
01:04:10,042 --> 01:04:12,941
They also have life,
they too will get hurt.

597
01:04:13,110 --> 01:04:14,940
Rubbish! Who says so?!

598
01:04:15,144 --> 01:04:17,337
- My mother used to say that.
-Your mother is dead! - Don't!

599
01:04:22,077 --> 01:04:24,475
Papa, Babbu hit Brother Rahul.

600
01:04:25,078 --> 01:04:26,977
Babbu hit Rahul? lmpossible!

601
01:04:27,145 --> 01:04:29,976
l saw Babbu hit him.

602
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:34,978
Come here.

603
01:04:39,114 --> 01:04:42,013
- Did you hit Rahul?
- No, l didn't hit him.

604
01:04:42,181 --> 01:04:45,011
l told you so.
My Babbu never hits anybody.

605
01:04:45,181 --> 01:04:48,443
- He's lying. He hit him.
-All right. Let's go.

606
01:04:48,648 --> 01:04:49,637
Come, son.

607
01:04:50,149 --> 01:04:52,048
-What will you drink?
- Thums up.

608
01:05:05,017 --> 01:05:07,347
Did Babbu hit you?

609
01:05:08,018 --> 01:05:09,416
No, he didn't.

610
01:05:11,052 --> 01:05:12,950
Who will play cricket?

611
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:14,450
Come on, everyone!

612
01:05:14,620 --> 01:05:16,949
- My turn first!
- Let's toss.

613
01:05:17,553 --> 01:05:18,950
- Give it to him.
- My turn first.

614
01:05:19,453 --> 01:05:21,942
- Kids afterthe elders.
- No. Elders afterthe kids.

615
01:05:27,087 --> 01:05:29,986
The kids have finished their
turn. Now it's the elders' turn.

616
01:05:30,155 --> 01:05:31,985
DK, bowl a googly!

617
01:05:34,590 --> 01:05:35,987
Watchman! What are you doing?!

618
01:05:40,090 --> 01:05:41,783
Leave me! ...This is cheating!

619
01:05:45,124 --> 01:05:46,522
l made it!

620
01:05:48,125 --> 01:05:50,023
Mr. Umpire, your place is here!

621
01:05:53,125 --> 01:05:55,455
-Aunt Kanta! Run!
-Where do l throw it?

622
01:05:55,658 --> 01:05:57,057
Here!

623
01:05:59,659 --> 01:06:02,922
-Wow! Good throw, my lioness!
- Naturally!

624
01:06:13,528 --> 01:06:14,926
You're cheating!

625
01:06:15,095 --> 01:06:16,925
He's not out. l am the umpire.

626
01:06:18,062 --> 01:06:20,392
Mummy! Move a little there.
...That's right.

627
01:06:20,562 --> 01:06:22,961
Watchman! Move behind... Further!

628
01:06:23,130 --> 01:06:24,460
- Here?
- That's fine!

629
01:06:24,630 --> 01:06:27,461
A little more.
Yes... That's fine.

630
01:06:28,764 --> 01:06:30,754
Come, son!
lt's only cricket!

631
01:06:35,098 --> 01:06:36,997
lt's my turn to bat!

632
01:06:37,165 --> 01:06:39,995
Hadn't l told you he'd
grow up to be like Kapil Dev!

633
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:56,328
-Aunt, take the catch!
- Go take your run!

634
01:06:56,635 --> 01:06:58,032
Ourfielding isn't tight.

635
01:06:58,201 --> 01:07:00,394
lt's a tough game!

636
01:07:03,035 --> 01:07:05,434
Mr. Umpire, keep this here.

637
01:07:11,037 --> 01:07:12,127
Come on!

638
01:07:17,037 --> 01:07:19,436
Didn't l tell you he'd
become a Gavaskar someday!

639
01:07:20,038 --> 01:07:21,937
With bowlers like me, he will
surely become a Gavaskar!

640
01:07:25,572 --> 01:07:27,971
- Come, Rahul. You bowl too.
- No.

641
01:07:28,140 --> 01:07:29,663
No problem. Play underarm.

642
01:07:30,074 --> 01:07:32,471
Give it a try, Rahul.

643
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:45,206
- He's going to bowl fast!
-You're sacred!

644
01:07:46,109 --> 01:07:47,803
Come on, my lion!

645
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:54,008
Come on!

646
01:08:02,012 --> 01:08:04,909
Well, Mr. Lion Suri!!

647
01:08:06,012 --> 01:08:07,910
Saw how amazing my...

648
01:08:17,046 --> 01:08:20,445
These crockery and cutlery...

649
01:08:22,047 --> 01:08:25,946
...have been bought from
Harrod's store in London.

650
01:08:27,048 --> 01:08:29,947
And these idiots levy
a duty of 1 50% on it.

651
01:08:30,150 --> 01:08:33,377
l could nevertolerate
cheap spoons in college...

652
01:08:33,582 --> 01:08:36,413
...so l can't possibly
tolerate them now!

653
01:08:36,583 --> 01:08:38,482
You have a mania
for imported items.

654
01:08:38,651 --> 01:08:40,549
You should have got
an imported wife, too!

655
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:42,515
Take some.

656
01:08:44,118 --> 01:08:47,811
Wife? ...Well, you don't get
wives at the Harrod's store.

657
01:08:48,118 --> 01:08:50,017
Or else, l would
have surely got one.

658
01:08:50,185 --> 01:08:53,016
But once in New York...

659
01:08:53,186 --> 01:08:56,619
Tell your wife.
Don't hide things from Kanta.

660
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:59,011
No. There's nothing to hide.

661
01:08:59,187 --> 01:09:04,916
Trixie came into my life
before Kanta did.

662
01:09:05,421 --> 01:09:06,888
Trixie? Who's she?

663
01:09:07,089 --> 01:09:09,486
Trixie means full of tricks.

664
01:09:10,021 --> 01:09:13,352
Kanta, don't take him seriously.
He loves to tease you.

665
01:09:13,522 --> 01:09:15,456
There is nothing to tease about.

666
01:09:15,622 --> 01:09:20,181
lf l have ever met anyone else
after marrying you, then...

667
01:09:20,390 --> 01:09:22,413
...have l evertold you about it?

668
01:09:22,624 --> 01:09:24,522
lf there is another woman,
then remarry!

669
01:09:25,057 --> 01:09:28,956
He is joking, Kanta. Would he
ever leave you to remarry?!

670
01:09:31,058 --> 01:09:35,457
One can form relationships,
even without getting married.

671
01:09:36,058 --> 01:09:38,991
- lndu, what are you saying?
- The truth.

672
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:42,991
lndu, you may say
whateveryou like about me.

673
01:09:43,161 --> 01:09:45,991
But there is no need to
speak about DK this way.

674
01:09:46,161 --> 01:09:47,990
There was a need,
so l spoke.

675
01:09:48,194 --> 01:09:48,990
Meaning?

676
01:09:51,128 --> 01:09:53,526
You can ask him that!

677
01:09:54,128 --> 01:09:56,526
Hey! What's wrong
with her? ...lndu!

678
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:03,219
What's the matter?

679
01:10:04,630 --> 01:10:08,029
l've been observing this tension
between you since morning.

680
01:10:09,131 --> 01:10:13,029
And the way lndu was
talking to that boy Rahul...

681
01:10:13,765 --> 01:10:16,061
Who is Rahul?

682
01:10:20,167 --> 01:10:22,598
- He is my son.
-What!

683
01:10:30,201 --> 01:10:32,758
When l went
to Nainital in 1 973...

684
01:10:39,035 --> 01:10:40,933
- No, l won't have.
-You're grown up now!

685
01:10:41,102 --> 01:10:43,126
-You're going to be a father!
- Get lost!

686
01:10:43,536 --> 01:10:46,469
Well... but you aren't
even married as yet!

687
01:10:49,570 --> 01:10:54,163
ln the midst of the din, she too
was there... lonely and quiet.

688
01:10:55,104 --> 01:10:59,003
Her name was Bhavna.
l knew herfrom my school days.

689
01:10:59,172 --> 01:11:02,367
She used to be so lively.
But now...

690
01:11:02,972 --> 01:11:05,871
This girl has been
through a big tragedy.

691
01:11:06,039 --> 01:11:09,494
She lost herfamily in a car
accident while still in school.

692
01:11:09,973 --> 01:11:14,373
The master said that Bhavna had
completely withdrawn since then.

693
01:11:15,574 --> 01:11:18,302
The master knew Bhavna and
herfamily since a long time...

694
01:11:18,508 --> 01:11:21,406
...so, in a way,
her responsibility fell on him.

695
01:11:22,009 --> 01:11:26,374
He wanted Bhavna to
somehow overcome her grief.

696
01:11:27,009 --> 01:11:28,408
Orthat someone explain to her.

697
01:11:29,042 --> 01:11:30,703
DK, show me your hand.

698
01:11:39,045 --> 01:11:40,943
This is your marriage line.

699
01:11:42,546 --> 01:11:44,444
How deep and strong it is!

700
01:11:46,546 --> 01:11:48,444
lndu and you are
very happy, aren't you?

701
01:11:48,612 --> 01:11:49,942
Yes, very much so.

702
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:54,944
Look, how strong
it is all throughout. But...

703
01:11:57,080 --> 01:12:00,308
- But at one point...
-At one point? What?

704
01:12:01,981 --> 01:12:05,879
Never mind. Since you don't
believe in it, forget it.

705
01:12:06,982 --> 01:12:09,880
But what did you see?

706
01:12:10,049 --> 01:12:11,878
Nothing. Never mind.

707
01:12:14,983 --> 01:12:16,881
Tell me one more thing.

708
01:12:17,983 --> 01:12:19,881
Will we get a
baby boy or a baby girl?

709
01:12:23,018 --> 01:12:26,883
You do have a boy. But l'm
not sure if it will be this time.

710
01:12:27,085 --> 01:12:31,415
l want a son!

711
01:12:32,019 --> 01:12:33,917
Then you'll surely get a son.

712
01:12:36,553 --> 01:12:37,951
Show me your hand.

713
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:40,951
-What will you do looking at it?
-At least show it.

714
01:12:42,054 --> 01:12:44,452
Now l'll tell you yourfuture.
...Show me your hand.

715
01:12:50,055 --> 01:12:51,749
Where is your marriage line?

716
01:12:52,322 --> 01:12:54,447
- Oh yes! ...The left hand.
- lt's this one.

717
01:12:55,323 --> 01:12:57,448
lt's incomplete.

718
01:12:58,089 --> 01:13:01,250
But there is
a faint line all along.

719
01:13:01,458 --> 01:13:04,356
Yes. l can't understand.

720
01:13:04,957 --> 01:13:08,287
There is a marriage line,
and yet there isn't.

721
01:13:08,491 --> 01:13:13,686
Let me see.
Where is your life line?

722
01:13:13,992 --> 01:13:15,390
Here it is.

723
01:13:15,993 --> 01:13:19,390
This one? ...it's rather short.

724
01:13:19,993 --> 01:13:21,687
l know.

725
01:13:21,993 --> 01:13:23,323
You do?

726
01:13:23,494 --> 01:13:27,893
l see! That means,
you have decided to die soon!

727
01:13:28,061 --> 01:13:30,891
l haven't decided that.
...l know it.

728
01:13:32,229 --> 01:13:32,887
She knows!

729
01:13:34,528 --> 01:13:38,394
And she is dead.
l can't believe it!

730
01:13:39,029 --> 01:13:41,928
She had a strange blind belief.

731
01:13:43,063 --> 01:13:45,393
On meeting Bhavna,
l was surprised to see...

732
01:13:45,564 --> 01:13:48,962
...that a person could bottle up
one's grief for so long.

733
01:13:49,565 --> 01:13:51,963
As though sorrows had become
the sole purpose of her life.

734
01:13:55,566 --> 01:13:57,964
l was sympathetic towards Bhavna.

735
01:13:59,065 --> 01:14:00,827
And Bhavna needed that.

736
01:14:01,432 --> 01:14:04,365
lt was plain sympathy, which one
can feel towards anybody.

737
01:14:05,967 --> 01:14:07,626
Nothing more.

738
01:14:08,967 --> 01:14:12,832
Forget all this, Bhavna.
These things are useless.

739
01:14:13,034 --> 01:14:17,900
Fate and destiny are all rubbish!
Lead the life of a normal girl.

740
01:14:18,269 --> 01:14:21,393
Please don't scold me, DK.

741
01:14:22,503 --> 01:14:25,901
Please come and sit next to me.

742
01:14:26,070 --> 01:14:28,901
She asked me to sit next to her,
and l did not refuse.

743
01:14:31,004 --> 01:14:32,902
What happened afterthat...

744
01:14:34,805 --> 01:14:36,703
l can't explain to anyone.

745
01:14:46,540 --> 01:14:47,937
lndu and my children...

746
01:14:52,074 --> 01:14:53,972
...mean the world to me.

747
01:14:55,574 --> 01:15:00,338
My... My home is
breaking apart, Suri.

748
01:15:01,942 --> 01:15:04,636
What do l do?

749
01:15:05,943 --> 01:15:07,841
How do l explain to lndu?

750
01:15:10,977 --> 01:15:13,034
My home is breaking apart.

751
01:15:15,777 --> 01:15:17,834
You will have to do one thing.

752
01:15:19,978 --> 01:15:24,343
You will have to
send that boy away.

753
01:15:24,512 --> 01:15:25,910
l know that.

754
01:15:28,012 --> 01:15:30,410
But where will l send him?

755
01:15:31,013 --> 01:15:32,911
To a boarding school.

756
01:15:37,215 --> 01:15:38,908
He too has a right.

757
01:15:42,215 --> 01:15:45,910
Where will he go?
How is he at fault?

758
01:15:48,050 --> 01:15:50,447
What has that
innocent child done?

759
01:15:52,050 --> 01:15:55,141
Mummy, l can't solve
these sums. Please help me.

760
01:15:56,584 --> 01:15:59,847
Winky, don't disturb me.
l can't solve your sums.

761
01:16:01,451 --> 01:16:03,349
What's the matter with
you these days, mummy?

762
01:16:03,518 --> 01:16:07,645
Suppose that fatso stands first
in class again, then?

763
01:16:10,220 --> 01:16:13,243
- May l help you?
- Do you know to solve them?

764
01:16:13,453 --> 01:16:14,850
Yes, l do.

765
01:16:18,987 --> 01:16:20,385
Show me.

766
01:16:33,523 --> 01:16:36,354
Mini, what are you doing!
...How do you know this, Rahul?

767
01:16:36,524 --> 01:16:40,513
l always stood first in Math.
But l was a bit weak in Hindi.

768
01:16:41,023 --> 01:16:42,422
Won't you study further?

769
01:16:44,225 --> 01:16:46,123
Stay back in Delhi.
Study here.

770
01:16:47,024 --> 01:16:49,923
- Shall l stay here?
-Yes! Stay here.

771
01:16:51,059 --> 01:16:52,957
l'll have to ask aunty.

772
01:16:53,559 --> 01:16:56,458
Why ask mummy?
She loves all children.

773
01:16:56,627 --> 01:16:59,115
Yes! Mummy loves children!

774
01:16:59,427 --> 01:17:00,825
Me, too?

775
01:17:01,026 --> 01:17:04,084
Yes! She is a little shy
of you. You're still new.

776
01:17:05,961 --> 01:17:08,860
Gupta was saying that a lot
remains to be done on the design.

777
01:17:09,027 --> 01:17:10,858
Yes, sir. That's right.

778
01:17:11,028 --> 01:17:14,358
We have a presentation at
Mr. Bansal's office within a week.

779
01:17:14,529 --> 01:17:16,859
He has already called twice.
What's the matter with you?

780
01:17:23,997 --> 01:17:25,485
lt's a personal problem.

781
01:17:30,998 --> 01:17:34,362
l'll take this home.
l'll try to finish it there.

782
01:18:24,973 --> 01:18:27,371
For how long will you
continue to have sleeping pills?

783
01:18:31,007 --> 01:18:32,906
Till l don't get sleep!

784
01:18:51,043 --> 01:18:54,737
''Respected Master,
l am absolutely fine here.''

785
01:18:55,044 --> 01:18:57,442
''ls there been
any letterfrom my father?''

786
01:18:58,045 --> 01:19:01,807
lt should be Has there been
any letter' and not ls there'.

787
01:19:01,979 --> 01:19:02,876
Okay?

788
01:19:03,946 --> 01:19:07,810
''Any news about him?
Uncle loves me a lot.''

789
01:19:08,013 --> 01:19:13,344
''There is an aunty too. Even she
loves me but is a little shy.''

790
01:19:13,947 --> 01:19:15,345
''Are you all right?''

791
01:19:15,981 --> 01:19:18,879
- Brother Rahul, who's drawn this?
- l have.

792
01:19:19,047 --> 01:19:21,878
- But who are they?
- This is your papa...

793
01:19:22,048 --> 01:19:25,310
...your mother,
your sister and you.

794
01:19:25,482 --> 01:19:26,879
Where is mummy's bun?

795
01:19:27,048 --> 01:19:29,879
lt's behind. You can't see it.

796
01:19:30,049 --> 01:19:33,379
That's right. You can't see it.
But where are you?

797
01:19:33,984 --> 01:19:35,381
l'm sitting right here.

798
01:19:35,550 --> 01:19:37,380
-Where are you in this picture?
- l'm not here.

799
01:19:37,584 --> 01:19:39,914
- Shall l draw myself here?
- Please do.

800
01:19:40,085 --> 01:19:42,347
lt's mummy's birthday
the day aftertomorrow.

801
01:19:42,519 --> 01:19:44,417
l forgot to get bangles for her.

802
01:19:45,018 --> 01:19:47,917
Brother Rahul, what
will you get for mummy?

803
01:19:48,119 --> 01:19:49,414
l...

804
01:19:52,453 --> 01:19:54,920
Shall l make a
bangle box for aunty?

805
01:19:59,554 --> 01:20:02,953
l've composed a poem.
Shall l recite it?

806
01:20:03,121 --> 01:20:04,144
Forget it!

807
01:20:04,555 --> 01:20:06,453
''Awooden log,
On it is a wooden horse''

808
01:20:06,622 --> 01:20:08,953
''A hammerfell- Crash, boom, bang
on the horse's tail!''

809
01:24:16,593 --> 01:24:18,991
-You'll come in, won't you?
- No. l'll come later.

810
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:20,490
Come on, Brother Rahul.

811
01:24:32,096 --> 01:24:33,493
Let's go in.

812
01:24:33,663 --> 01:24:35,492
- Let's go.
- No. - Come on.

813
01:24:36,130 --> 01:24:37,528
l'll come later.

814
01:25:17,069 --> 01:25:18,467
Move aside.

815
01:25:22,103 --> 01:25:25,001
- Let me also do something.
- Quiet! Don't harass us!

816
01:25:25,170 --> 01:25:26,568
Let her do it.

817
01:25:26,737 --> 01:25:28,998
She won't do a thing. She will
only spoil my handwriting.

818
01:25:29,604 --> 01:25:31,434
l'll also write.

819
01:25:31,605 --> 01:25:33,503
Don't write anything.
You don't know anything!

820
01:25:33,672 --> 01:25:35,501
What are you doing, children?

821
01:25:36,105 --> 01:25:38,503
Please go away!

822
01:25:39,105 --> 01:25:40,799
Mummy is coming!

823
01:25:43,139 --> 01:25:45,538
- Please come, mummy.
-What's the matter?

824
01:25:45,707 --> 01:25:49,037
Nothing. Please be seated
and have your breakfast.

825
01:25:50,141 --> 01:25:54,006
-What's this?
-Your birthday present.

826
01:25:57,176 --> 01:25:59,937
-What is it?
- Open it and have a look.

827
01:26:04,043 --> 01:26:05,441
lt's lovely!

828
01:26:05,610 --> 01:26:07,735
- Did you get it, Winky?
- No.

829
01:26:08,044 --> 01:26:10,943
l don't think Mini must
have got it. Who bought it?

830
01:26:11,111 --> 01:26:13,941
Brother Rahul has personally
made it foryour birthday.

831
01:26:18,078 --> 01:26:21,943
Papa, look what
Brother Rahul made for mummy.

832
01:26:22,580 --> 01:26:25,943
Papa, look what Rahul
made for mummy... Look, papa.

833
01:26:31,114 --> 01:26:35,012
Have you made this?
...lt's lovely!

834
01:26:35,181 --> 01:26:37,010
Didn't aunty like it?

835
01:26:38,114 --> 01:26:41,013
- Of course, she did.
- She liked it very much.

836
01:26:41,182 --> 01:26:42,579
Yes! She liked it very much.

837
01:29:07,837 --> 01:29:10,395
-What happened?
- Take your son away!

838
01:29:55,144 --> 01:29:58,542
l am not your mother! Don't you
dare call me mummy again!

839
01:30:11,381 --> 01:30:13,279
Yuck! l don't like brinjal!

840
01:30:14,182 --> 01:30:16,080
Stupid! You don't like anything!

841
01:30:16,248 --> 01:30:19,078
You stupid! ...
You brinjal! You pumpkin!

842
01:30:19,248 --> 01:30:22,079
- Mummy, tell her.
-Winky, have your dinner quietly.

843
01:30:22,482 --> 01:30:25,074
Brother Rahul, please
pass me the cauliflower.

844
01:30:27,550 --> 01:30:31,449
Blood! Papa, Brother Rahul's
hand is bleeding!

845
01:30:32,217 --> 01:30:35,615
Mummy, look!
Brother Rahul's hand is bleeding!

846
01:30:37,218 --> 01:30:38,115
What happened?

847
01:30:45,252 --> 01:30:46,649
What's happened?

848
01:30:48,253 --> 01:30:49,946
lndu, how did he hurt himself?

849
01:30:54,786 --> 01:30:58,185
lndu! How did he hurt himself?

850
01:30:58,455 --> 01:31:01,012
How should l know?!
He didn't tell me!

851
01:31:02,155 --> 01:31:04,553
A child gets hurt at home,
and you aren't even aware!

852
01:31:05,155 --> 01:31:07,053
Don't scream at me
in front of the children!

853
01:31:07,356 --> 01:31:09,549
Just because
he is not your child?!

854
01:31:10,156 --> 01:31:13,247
Let the one who has sinned
take care of him! Why bother me?!

855
01:31:25,691 --> 01:31:28,090
Aren't you ashamed
of speaking so?!

856
01:31:28,292 --> 01:31:31,123
l have not been as shameless
as you! Are you ashamed?!

857
01:31:31,292 --> 01:31:33,191
So what should l do?!

858
01:31:33,426 --> 01:31:35,619
Tell me, what should l do?!

859
01:31:36,227 --> 01:31:38,125
Should l kill myself?!

860
01:31:42,028 --> 01:31:44,119
You want to go on leave?!
What's wrong with you, DK?

861
01:31:44,295 --> 01:31:47,126
The other architects have
already sent their proposals!

862
01:31:49,729 --> 01:31:51,718
Sir, if l don't get leave,
l will have to resign.

863
01:31:52,262 --> 01:31:56,127
Resign! Will you will have to
resign! What nonsense you speak!

864
01:31:56,330 --> 01:31:58,228
This is too much!
A height of negligence!

865
01:31:58,397 --> 01:32:00,625
You should have informed me
earlierthat you can't work!

866
01:32:01,164 --> 01:32:03,062
Sir, l'd told you earlier
that l have a personal problem!

867
01:32:03,231 --> 01:32:04,822
Even l have a problem!

868
01:32:06,164 --> 01:32:11,063
Look, l have to run the company.
l can't possibly do it alone.

869
01:32:11,232 --> 01:32:12,721
Tell me what the matter is.

870
01:32:21,767 --> 01:32:24,700
All right... You may go!

871
01:32:25,201 --> 01:32:28,565
You know your responsibility.
...You may go.

872
01:32:35,236 --> 01:32:37,566
- Uncle, will you take me boating?
- Sure.

873
01:32:37,737 --> 01:32:40,134
-What about riding?
- l'll take you riding too.

874
01:32:40,303 --> 01:32:42,565
-What about China Peak?
-You want to go there?

875
01:32:42,737 --> 01:32:43,931
-Yes.
-Walking?

876
01:32:44,237 --> 01:32:46,635
Yes. That's the master's house.

877
01:33:14,175 --> 01:33:15,573
Mr. Tiwari?

878
01:33:16,175 --> 01:33:18,074
-When did you come?
- This morning. Good you found us.

879
01:33:18,243 --> 01:33:21,504
We were going to come to school
at 2 p.m. for Rahul's admission.

880
01:33:21,676 --> 01:33:24,075
- The Principal told me.
- Son, greet him.

881
01:33:24,676 --> 01:33:27,075
- How are you, son?
- l'm fine. How are you?

882
01:33:27,243 --> 01:33:28,641
Absolutely fine.

883
01:33:28,777 --> 01:33:30,868
Where is the master?

884
01:33:33,211 --> 01:33:35,110
He passed away.

885
01:33:35,278 --> 01:33:38,109
What! ...When?

886
01:33:40,413 --> 01:33:44,106
He suffered a heart attack
a few days ago.

887
01:33:59,115 --> 01:34:03,515
Uncle, do you think my mother
may have lied to me?

888
01:34:04,149 --> 01:34:05,479
Why?

889
01:34:05,650 --> 01:34:09,014
Maybe, my father isn't alive?

890
01:34:23,386 --> 01:34:25,080
He'll be here soon.

891
01:34:28,186 --> 01:34:31,085
Please understand,
even l have some problems.

892
01:34:38,821 --> 01:34:42,549
Mr. Tiwari, will l
get admission here?

893
01:34:42,722 --> 01:34:45,120
Yes, son. We are trying.

894
01:34:48,256 --> 01:34:51,155
Will l have to stay here then?

895
01:34:52,256 --> 01:34:56,155
Yes. You can stay
in the hostel here.

896
01:35:04,125 --> 01:35:07,024
Where do l get his books?

897
01:35:07,192 --> 01:35:08,590
You'll get the list from office.

898
01:35:09,126 --> 01:35:12,058
- Do l get his uniforms or...
- They will be made here.

899
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:16,058
Rahul, come here.
...Meet your Principal.

900
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:20,059
How will you send him?

901
01:35:20,228 --> 01:35:22,660
l will be going to Delhi,
so l'll fetch him.

902
01:35:22,828 --> 01:35:24,054
Mr. Tiwari will bring him here.

903
01:35:26,194 --> 01:35:30,093
So now you're going
to join our school.

904
01:35:30,696 --> 01:35:34,094
Thank him, son. He has
agreed to give you admission.

905
01:35:34,263 --> 01:35:35,661
Say thank you.

906
01:35:37,197 --> 01:35:41,596
Can l send you
a cheque forthe fee?

907
01:35:42,197 --> 01:35:46,096
You can sign the papers after
2 days when the office opens.

908
01:35:46,731 --> 01:35:48,130
All right.

909
01:35:50,232 --> 01:35:53,131
Send him after 1 0 days.
And do not be late.

910
01:35:53,299 --> 01:35:57,163
l don't like boys who come late.
...Do you understand?

911
01:35:59,334 --> 01:36:01,527
Let's leave, Rahul.
...Thank you, Brother.

912
01:36:06,634 --> 01:36:10,829
Uncle, the string has gone in.

913
01:36:15,136 --> 01:36:17,034
The string has gone in?

914
01:36:17,569 --> 01:36:20,035
Tie it around from outside.

915
01:36:22,171 --> 01:36:23,067
Come here.

916
01:36:30,205 --> 01:36:31,727
- Sleep the way it is.
- No. lt will fall.

917
01:36:32,205 --> 01:36:34,603
lt won't fall.
Take a blanket to sleep.

918
01:36:36,473 --> 01:36:37,904
Go to sleep.

919
01:36:40,206 --> 01:36:42,105
What's the time?

920
01:36:43,206 --> 01:36:44,605
lt's 8:30. Why?

921
01:36:45,206 --> 01:36:48,537
Mini must be in the bathroom
brushing herteeth...

922
01:36:48,708 --> 01:36:51,902
...and Winky must be
banging loudly at the door.

923
01:36:52,742 --> 01:36:54,139
Hurry up, Mini!

924
01:36:56,243 --> 01:36:58,801
Hurry! ...Hurry up, stupid!

925
01:37:04,144 --> 01:37:05,041
Yuck!

926
01:37:05,209 --> 01:37:06,369
Why is there so much of noise?

927
01:37:06,744 --> 01:37:09,539
Mummy, tell Mini. She occupies
the bathroom for so long.

928
01:37:09,711 --> 01:37:12,041
Dirty girl!
Go wash yourface.

929
01:37:12,211 --> 01:37:16,042
One more thing... Both of you
can sleep with me tonight.

930
01:37:16,212 --> 01:37:18,440
Are you afraid
of being alone, mummy?

931
01:37:39,215 --> 01:37:42,113
Uncle, l like you very much.

932
01:37:42,282 --> 01:37:44,112
- Really?
-Yes.

933
01:37:44,283 --> 01:37:48,613
Son, even l like you very much.

934
01:37:51,217 --> 01:37:55,116
When my papa comes,
l won't stay with him.

935
01:37:56,451 --> 01:37:59,213
-Why not?
- l will stay with you.

936
01:38:07,120 --> 01:38:10,552
Will l be able to
call you papa then?

937
01:41:33,518 --> 01:41:35,711
l don't want to
stay in this school!

938
01:41:37,318 --> 01:41:39,648
Why not?

939
01:41:39,819 --> 01:41:41,649
l don't like it!

940
01:41:41,820 --> 01:41:45,650
Stay here for a few days
and you will begin to like it.

941
01:41:45,820 --> 01:41:47,719
There are many other children
also who stay here.

942
01:41:47,986 --> 01:41:50,010
- Can't l stay in Delhi?
- No!

943
01:41:50,354 --> 01:41:54,218
You have to stay here for a while
in the hostel. Understand?

944
01:41:54,421 --> 01:41:56,251
Why can't l stay in your house?!

945
01:43:24,267 --> 01:43:25,756
And who is this?

946
01:43:27,268 --> 01:43:29,360
That's me and my papa.

947
01:43:32,802 --> 01:43:35,700
- Does your papa wear spectacles?
-Yes.

948
01:44:19,276 --> 01:44:21,174
Papa and Brother Rahul are back!

949
01:44:22,276 --> 01:44:23,674
Rahul is back?

950
01:44:27,544 --> 01:44:29,442
Mummy! Papa is back!

951
01:44:40,314 --> 01:44:41,779
Papa is back!

952
01:44:44,314 --> 01:44:46,212
Papa, what have you got for me?

953
01:44:49,347 --> 01:44:51,746
- Did you get my badminton racket?
-Yes!

954
01:44:57,349 --> 01:44:59,110
Just a minute. l'll be back.

955
01:45:04,716 --> 01:45:07,547
She was screaming a while ago,
''Brother Rahul is back!''

956
01:45:07,717 --> 01:45:09,615
And now you're not
even talking to him.

957
01:45:09,784 --> 01:45:11,909
No, l wasn't screaming.

958
01:45:12,251 --> 01:45:16,582
She's so shy of you now,
but soon she will be afteryou!

959
01:45:16,753 --> 01:45:17,649
No!

960
01:45:20,753 --> 01:45:22,151
Here it comes on you, Mini!

961
01:45:31,287 --> 01:45:34,378
- Did you get your admission?
-Yes.

962
01:45:36,489 --> 01:45:37,852
- So you'll go away?
-Yes.

963
01:46:03,226 --> 01:46:04,920
What happened?

964
01:46:09,227 --> 01:46:14,125
Major and l have once again...

965
01:46:20,261 --> 01:46:22,659
You've understood what
l am trying to say, right?

966
01:46:23,762 --> 01:46:24,660
Yes.

967
01:46:31,296 --> 01:46:35,627
But you would always say
that you don't need any support.

968
01:46:35,797 --> 01:46:38,195
That you don't need a family.

969
01:46:38,364 --> 01:46:40,762
And that you are
an independent woman.

970
01:46:44,899 --> 01:46:47,195
lt would be fine
if l were just a woman.

971
01:46:48,298 --> 01:46:50,197
But l'm a mothertoo.

972
01:46:51,733 --> 01:46:54,198
When my child
held my hand and said...

973
01:46:54,399 --> 01:46:56,729
''Please come home, mummy''

974
01:46:56,900 --> 01:46:58,594
...l couldn't hold myself back.

975
01:46:59,701 --> 01:47:01,600
ljust couldn't
hold myself back, lndu.

976
01:47:07,835 --> 01:47:09,631
Shall l say something, lndu?

977
01:47:10,236 --> 01:47:14,135
Awoman has no say when the
motherly feelings in her arise.

978
01:47:25,271 --> 01:47:26,601
-You tell her!
-You tell!

979
01:47:26,772 --> 01:47:29,170
-What happened?
- Sister has stood first in class.

980
01:47:29,372 --> 01:47:30,735
She defeated that fatso!

981
01:47:30,905 --> 01:47:33,599
Very good! Well-done!

982
01:47:33,773 --> 01:47:37,206
lf Brother Rahul had not taught
her, it would've been impossible.

983
01:47:37,373 --> 01:47:39,703
-Who's Rahul?
- Brother Rahul!

984
01:47:40,307 --> 01:47:42,704
The boy whom l
spoke to you about.

985
01:47:44,508 --> 01:47:46,701
lt's good that the kids have
mingled with each other so well.

986
01:47:58,710 --> 01:48:03,541
lt's not in this either.
They are my personal papers!

987
01:48:03,711 --> 01:48:06,109
They are Rahul's Nainital papers.
Where are they?

988
01:48:06,278 --> 01:48:09,108
l had told you to keep them
in a personal file!

989
01:48:09,745 --> 01:48:11,643
l have to send them
with Rahul to Nainital.

990
01:48:11,812 --> 01:48:14,142
Look in that drawer.
...the lower one.

991
01:48:20,247 --> 01:48:22,645
Sir, are these the papers?

992
01:48:24,447 --> 01:48:27,936
Yes. Where were they? Can't you
even file them properly?!

993
01:48:29,248 --> 01:48:32,181
- Rahul, take care of these.
-All right, uncle.

994
01:48:32,349 --> 01:48:34,178
They are your papers.
Take them home.

995
01:48:34,349 --> 01:48:36,747
-Are you being naughty?
- No.

996
01:48:36,916 --> 01:48:38,177
Sit in my cabin.

997
01:48:39,282 --> 01:48:41,181
l'll go meet Mr. Dhawan.

998
01:49:02,186 --> 01:49:03,346
Son.

999
01:49:04,219 --> 01:49:07,549
This letter must have fallen
from those papers. Keep it there.

1000
01:49:07,720 --> 01:49:09,618
-Whose letter is it?
- To Mr. Malhotra...

1001
01:49:12,220 --> 01:49:13,914
Give it to me.

1002
01:49:35,258 --> 01:49:36,656
l see.

1003
01:49:37,292 --> 01:49:40,985
You wanted a proposal from the
best architect. lt had to be good.

1004
01:49:41,292 --> 01:49:43,191
l think we'll clinch the deal.

1005
01:49:43,359 --> 01:49:46,189
Yes... All right,
l'll call you tomorrow.

1006
01:49:46,793 --> 01:49:49,191
Fine... after 2-3 days.
Bye, Mr. Bansal. Thank you.

1007
01:49:50,326 --> 01:49:53,725
DK, l think Mr. Bansal has
liked your proposal very much.

1008
01:50:02,929 --> 01:50:03,826
Come on.

1009
01:50:07,329 --> 01:50:08,727
Come on!

1010
01:50:09,329 --> 01:50:11,421
Don't forget the papers.

1011
01:50:28,400 --> 01:50:30,298
Wish him, Rahul.

1012
01:50:30,666 --> 01:50:32,098
Wish him.

1013
01:50:33,600 --> 01:50:36,294
-Whose son is he?
- My friend's.

1014
01:50:37,400 --> 01:50:39,799
He's a very cute child.
Where does he study?

1015
01:50:40,601 --> 01:50:43,294
He'll be going to a
boarding school in Nainital.

1016
01:52:09,348 --> 01:52:11,246
Rahul is not at home!

1017
01:52:11,848 --> 01:52:14,679
-What!
- l searched everywhere.

1018
01:52:14,849 --> 01:52:16,246
And the front door was open.

1019
01:52:47,420 --> 01:52:49,819
Stay with the children.
l'll take a look outside.

1020
01:52:53,922 --> 01:52:56,820
What happened, mummy?
Where is Rahul?

1021
01:52:57,389 --> 01:52:58,219
lt's nothing.

1022
01:52:58,389 --> 01:52:59,787
Why was papa shouting his name?

1023
01:53:29,960 --> 01:53:32,257
-Watchman, did any child pass by?
- No.

1024
01:53:32,460 --> 01:53:34,290
- Light skinned with blue eyes?
- No, sir.

1025
01:53:54,931 --> 01:53:57,988
He's nowhere to be seen. Call
the police, l'll take the car.

1026
01:54:00,299 --> 01:54:03,992
Wait, lndu...
Don't call the police.

1027
01:54:04,532 --> 01:54:06,691
Give the phone here.

1028
01:54:27,368 --> 01:54:29,267
- Please call Mr. Suri.
- He's sleeping.

1029
01:54:29,435 --> 01:54:31,266

1030
01:54:31,436 --> 01:54:33,266
-Who's calling?

1031
01:54:33,436 --> 01:54:36,062
- Call Mr. Suri. lt's urgent.

1033
01:54:41,405 --> 01:54:44,303
Ask Suri to stay ready.
l'll pick him up.

1034
01:55:20,343 --> 01:55:21,742
There he is!

1035
01:55:34,378 --> 01:55:36,777
Rahul, where are you running?

1036
01:55:37,379 --> 01:55:38,777
Wait, Rahul!

1037
01:55:46,414 --> 01:55:47,881
Suri, it's not him.

1038
01:55:51,415 --> 01:55:54,779
Where the hell is he?!
Where could he have disappeared?!

1039
01:55:55,449 --> 01:55:57,176
-Where do l look for him?!
- Come on, now!

1040
01:55:57,382 --> 01:56:01,645
What's the use of looking for
him here? lt wasn't that boy.

1041
01:56:01,817 --> 01:56:04,215
-What do l do?
- Let's go to the police station.

1042
01:56:04,817 --> 01:56:08,215
So how are you?
How is everything else?

1043
01:56:10,319 --> 01:56:13,717
l'd called you the other day
but you didn't come.

1044
01:56:16,353 --> 01:56:20,217
Well, l don't get the time... Bye.

1045
01:56:25,854 --> 01:56:27,445
Could you please hurry?

1046
01:56:33,888 --> 01:56:35,286
Father's name?

1047
01:56:36,388 --> 01:56:37,786
Father's name!

1048
01:56:38,389 --> 01:56:41,287
What will you do
with the father's name?

1049
01:56:41,456 --> 01:56:44,287
You have the child's name
and his entire description.

1050
01:56:44,457 --> 01:56:46,548
On finding him, will you
ask him his father's name?!

1051
01:56:46,724 --> 01:56:48,280
Father's name?

1052
01:56:52,625 --> 01:56:53,521
Louder.

1053
01:56:53,691 --> 01:56:56,783
DK Malhotra! Can't you hear?!

1054
01:56:58,292 --> 01:56:59,689
Calm down.

1055
01:57:01,292 --> 01:57:06,225
DK, any news? Did you find him?
Where are you calling from?

1056
01:57:06,527 --> 01:57:09,721
l'm calling from a petrol pump
nearthe police station.

1057
01:57:10,327 --> 01:57:14,226
We have filed a report at the
police station. But of no avail.

1058
01:57:14,828 --> 01:57:19,022
There's no news of him.
l wonder what's happened to him.

1059
01:57:25,863 --> 01:57:28,694
Come home.

1060
01:57:28,864 --> 01:57:31,262
lt's no use sitting there.

1061
01:57:37,398 --> 01:57:38,795
What is she saying?

1062
01:57:39,898 --> 01:57:43,797
Excuse me!
Any news of the boy?

1063
01:57:44,398 --> 01:57:46,297
None, yet.

1064
01:57:46,466 --> 01:57:50,296
Of what use is such a big unit?!
Can't you find even a child?!

1065
01:57:50,466 --> 01:57:52,365
What are you here for?!

1066
01:57:56,434 --> 01:57:57,196
Come on!

1067
01:58:14,537 --> 01:58:17,003
We found this boy.
ls he yours?

1068
01:58:19,538 --> 01:58:22,231
We found this letter
in his pocket.

1069
01:58:22,404 --> 01:58:26,235
He refused to say where he lives.
This letter had your address.

1070
01:58:26,838 --> 01:58:28,737
Please sign here.

1071
01:58:35,373 --> 01:58:36,839
Where did you go?

1072
01:58:42,041 --> 01:58:44,064
l asked, where did you go?!

1073
01:58:51,409 --> 01:58:54,308
l am asking you something!
Where did you go?!

1074
01:58:57,877 --> 01:59:01,173
Aren't you ashamed?! You are
a guest at somebody's house!

1075
01:59:01,344 --> 01:59:03,243
We're doing so much foryou!

1076
01:59:03,411 --> 01:59:06,173
lnstead of being grateful,
this is what you do!

1077
01:59:07,578 --> 01:59:10,703
Now, what's the use of standing
in front of me like a statue?!

1078
01:59:10,879 --> 01:59:13,778
You don't even have
the courtesy to apologise!

1079
01:59:14,313 --> 01:59:18,245
l am glad you're leaving!
We'll be rid of you!

1080
01:59:19,347 --> 01:59:21,745
There has been no peace in the
house ever since you've come!

1081
01:59:21,914 --> 01:59:24,244
Do you know how worried
Mini and Winky have been foryou?

1082
01:59:24,414 --> 01:59:26,243
Mini hasn't stopped crying!

1083
01:59:26,414 --> 01:59:28,745
And l've been in and around
the house looking foryou!

1084
01:59:29,348 --> 01:59:33,247
What would we have done
if you were harmed in any way?!

1085
01:59:35,349 --> 01:59:39,248
Does one walk out
at midnight in this city!

1086
01:59:39,450 --> 01:59:41,712
They kidnap small children!

1087
01:59:41,884 --> 01:59:44,715
The entire police force of the city
is in search of you!

1088
01:59:44,885 --> 01:59:47,783
lf something were to happen
to you, yourfather and l...

1089
01:59:49,618 --> 01:59:51,517
l mean, your uncle and l...

1090
01:59:52,919 --> 01:59:55,316
- l know.
-What do you know?

1091
01:59:56,419 --> 02:00:00,317
That he's my papa.
lt is written in the letter.

1092
02:00:43,759 --> 02:00:45,385
DK, wait.

1093
02:00:45,792 --> 02:00:47,384
Just a minute.

1094
02:00:57,428 --> 02:01:00,326
- He knows.
-What?

1095
02:01:03,930 --> 02:01:06,327
About your relationship with him.

1096
02:01:08,429 --> 02:01:09,327
How?

1097
02:01:12,430 --> 02:01:14,123
He had this with him.

1098
02:01:18,099 --> 02:01:19,826
Go to him.

1099
02:02:15,440 --> 02:02:16,337
Listen.

1100
02:02:20,441 --> 02:02:23,532
Son, you shouldn't do this.
Where did you go?

1101
02:02:27,742 --> 02:02:32,142
Uncle Suri and l
looked foryou everywhere.

1102
02:02:45,511 --> 02:02:47,204
Are you angry with me?

1103
02:02:56,947 --> 02:02:58,311
What happened?

1104
02:03:00,414 --> 02:03:01,811
Nothing.

1105
02:03:05,414 --> 02:03:06,813
What does he say?

1106
02:03:11,448 --> 02:03:13,347
He isn't saying a word.

1107
02:03:21,450 --> 02:03:23,349
l can understand.

1108
02:03:27,951 --> 02:03:32,350
lmagine a child who is trying to
trace his father since years...

1109
02:03:32,551 --> 02:03:35,881
...and when he finally
does find him...

1110
02:03:36,052 --> 02:03:38,382
...his father
does not accept him.

1111
02:03:39,487 --> 02:03:43,420
He keeps him apart
and sends him far away.

1112
02:03:45,521 --> 02:03:51,421
You can imagine what that
child must be going through.

1113
02:03:53,522 --> 02:03:55,420
Sorry about saying all this.

1114
02:03:58,389 --> 02:03:59,788
Let's go to sleep.

1115
02:04:01,390 --> 02:04:05,289
Carry on. l'll come later.

1116
02:04:22,960 --> 02:04:26,858
Drop the children to school
by taxi in the morning.

1117
02:04:28,460 --> 02:04:30,551
l'll take Rahul to the station.

1118
02:07:00,383 --> 02:07:01,781
Come on, Mini.

1119
02:07:02,417 --> 02:07:05,316
Come, Mini.
We are getting late.

1120
02:07:47,991 --> 02:07:50,821
Mummy, why had Rahul run away?

1121
02:07:50,991 --> 02:07:52,390
l don't know.

1122
02:07:54,492 --> 02:07:57,754
Won't he ever return now?

1123
02:07:58,392 --> 02:07:59,790
l don't know.

1124
02:08:00,393 --> 02:08:03,086
-Whom will he stay with?
-With his papa.

1125
02:08:04,893 --> 02:08:06,792
But he doesn't have a papa.

1126
02:08:07,393 --> 02:08:11,326
He does. He had drawn his papa's
picture and showed it to me.

1127
02:08:15,028 --> 02:08:17,324
Hey, this is Rahul's sketch book.

1128
02:08:17,629 --> 02:08:19,754
Yes. He gave it to me.

1129
02:08:19,929 --> 02:08:25,328
This is mummy, me, you,
papa and Brother Rahul.

1130
02:08:25,496 --> 02:08:29,123
This is Brother Rahul
and his papa.

1131
02:08:41,498 --> 02:08:44,397
Did you strike off
Rahul's picture?

1132
02:08:44,566 --> 02:08:46,157
No.

1133
02:09:37,474 --> 02:09:40,372
-Where is sir?
- He's taken Rahul to the station.

1134
02:09:49,509 --> 02:09:50,907
Mr. Tiwari! Here.

1135
02:09:52,509 --> 02:09:54,407
- How are you?
- Let's go, Rahul.

1136

- l'll carry it.
- No, allow me.

1138
02:09:59,511 --> 02:10:01,204
- How are you, Rahul?
- This way, Mr. Tiwari.

1139
02:10:04,511 --> 02:10:07,410
The seat numbers are 55 and 56.

1140
02:10:27,582 --> 02:10:29,980
Come on, Rahul.
The train is about to leave.

1141
02:11:10,022 --> 02:11:13,420
Will you come to meet me?

1142

Yes, son. l will surely come.
Wheneveryou say so.

1144
02:11:24,624 --> 02:11:28,454
No, son. l will neverforget you.
...Not this time.

1145
02:11:29,591 --> 02:11:31,489
You won't forget me, will you?

1146
02:11:32,592 --> 02:11:36,991
How can l forget you?
After all, you are my papa.

02:11:37,592 --> 02:11:41,991
Yes... Yes, son. l'm your papa.

Come on, Rahul, hurry up.
The train is about to leave.

02:12:19,032 --> 02:12:21,430
- Mr. Tiwari...

1152
02:12:22,032 --> 02:12:23,431

-What about the food?
- l'll arrange it in the train.

1154
02:12:27,633 --> 02:12:29,532
Don't let him

1155
02:12:29,701 --> 02:12:31,894
- Have you kept his water bottle?
- lt must be with him.

1156
02:12:32,067 --> 02:12:34,260
- Son, where is your bottle?
- lt's in the car.
