1
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:37,417
Radha has it turned on?
- No.

2
00:01:37,667 --> 00:01:38,417
What happened?

3
00:01:38,667 --> 00:01:39,959
I'm checking, Krishna.

4
00:01:40,042 --> 00:01:42,001
Fast, Bittu will wake up.

5
00:01:42,084 --> 00:01:43,292
Yes, yes, yes, it’s on.

6
00:01:43,376 --> 00:01:44,542
Make it fast.

7
00:01:44,626 --> 00:01:45,417
Did you put in the batteries?

8
00:01:45,501 --> 00:01:47,084
Yes. It's on.

9
00:01:47,167 --> 00:01:49,667
Today is Bittu's birthday.
Did you feed the date?

10
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:53,751
Yeah, yeah, okay date. Thirteen.

11
00:01:56,376 --> 00:01:58,876
Since we got married,
I've wanted to tell you something.

12
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,167
I will tell you today.

13
00:02:00,334 --> 00:02:01,126
I've got you a gift too...

14
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:02,834
I am not in the mood
to listen to you now.

15
00:02:02,876 --> 00:02:04,709
We have to give gifts to Bittu.

16
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:07,501
Lets finish what's important.
Everyone is waiting downstairs.

17
00:02:11,251 --> 00:02:13,334
Happy happy birthday Bittu.

18
00:02:13,417 --> 00:02:15,334
You have become a very big boy today.

19
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:18,126
There is no one else
more dangerous than you.

20
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:20,792
But you have to become
even more dangerous, okay?

21
00:02:21,126 --> 00:02:23,667
You should break all
the gifts I got you in a week.

22
00:02:23,751 --> 00:02:26,334
Only then will you get new ones.

23
00:02:26,417 --> 00:02:27,959
That's enough, turn it here.

24
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:33,542
Happy happy birthday Kanna.

25
00:02:33,751 --> 00:02:36,126
Has it already been 6 years Bittu?

26
00:02:36,542 --> 00:02:40,417
From the time you were born until now,
I don't know how time has gone.

27
00:02:40,751 --> 00:02:44,459
Before you were born,
I don't remember anything at all.

28
00:02:44,626 --> 00:02:47,667
You're the best boy in the whole world.

29
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:50,667
And thank you, thank you
for selecting me as your mother.

30
00:02:52,251 --> 00:02:55,834
You have to grow even bigger,
study well, help everyone...

31
00:02:55,917 --> 00:03:01,084
...make everyone say Bittu
is a good boy and do us proud, okay?

32
00:03:02,042 --> 00:03:03,209
I love you.

33
00:03:06,376 --> 00:03:07,626
Ladies first.

34
00:03:45,001 --> 00:03:47,542
Bittu. Bittu.

35
00:03:48,001 --> 00:03:51,542
Get up. Bittu wake up. Bittu.

36
00:03:52,167 --> 00:03:56,626
Bittu, get up.

37
00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:01,459
Bittu, get up sweetie.
Get up, get up, get up, get up.

38
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:03,334
Get up, get up.

39
00:04:03,417 --> 00:04:05,376
Happy birthday dear.
- Happy birthday sweetie.

40
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:07,667
Happy birthday Bittu.

41
00:04:07,751 --> 00:04:09,001
Thank you mummy.

42
00:04:09,084 --> 00:04:10,667
Where are my gifts daddy?

43
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:14,626
Hugs and kisses for mom,
but dad has to get the gifts?

44
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:16,834
Not fair Bittu, not fair at all.

45
00:04:16,876 --> 00:04:20,542
Happy birthday dear.
- Thank you daddy.

46
00:04:20,834 --> 00:04:22,251
Where are my gifts?

47
00:04:22,334 --> 00:04:23,917
They are in the hall, go and see.

48
00:05:11,917 --> 00:05:14,792
Surprise!

49
00:05:15,834 --> 00:05:20,376
Bittu, how is the cycle?
It’s good, right?

50
00:05:20,417 --> 00:05:21,792
Yes daddy, thank you.

51
00:05:21,876 --> 00:05:23,459
That's enough, give it to me.
- Come on Bittu, Bittu.

52
00:05:23,542 --> 00:05:25,001
Light the candle.

53
00:05:26,917 --> 00:05:33,876
Happy birthday to you,
Happy birthday to you.

54
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:37,001
Happy birthday dear Bittu.

55
00:05:37,084 --> 00:05:40,417
Bittu, Bittu. Make a wish, make a wish.

56
00:05:46,292 --> 00:05:51,126
Mom and dad should never fight
both of them should always be happy.

57
00:05:51,334 --> 00:05:54,126
Happy birthday to you.

58
00:05:56,459 --> 00:05:59,126
Come Bittu, cut it.
You made a wish, right?

59
00:05:59,209 --> 00:06:00,292
You made a wish, right?
- Yes daddy.

60
00:06:00,376 --> 00:06:01,959
Cut a big piece.

61
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:05,917
Why are you doing that?
- What happened Krishna?

62
00:06:06,001 --> 00:06:07,584
What are you doing?

63
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:15,042
I don't like a knife on Bittu's name.
Shall we cut the cake?

64
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:23,376
Cut it Bittu.

65
00:06:43,126 --> 00:06:47,417
Bittu, Bittu, Bittu. Here, have cake.
Bittu look here. Look here.

66
00:06:47,501 --> 00:06:50,709
Happy birthday to you.
- Look here.

67
00:06:50,792 --> 00:06:54,376
Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

68
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:00,001
I'm taking two of course.
- Okay, take it.

69
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:08,751
Bittu, why aren't you playing?

70
00:07:09,001 --> 00:07:12,667
Have I ever played without you?
Where did you go?

71
00:07:12,876 --> 00:07:14,876
Mom will never go anywhere, sweetheart.

72
00:07:15,084 --> 00:07:16,167
Whenever you want me...

73
00:07:16,251 --> 00:07:19,251
...you just have to say mom and
I will be right there next to you.

74
00:07:19,334 --> 00:07:21,376
I am here now. Come let’s go play.

75
00:08:31,542 --> 00:08:34,876
"A dream that touched my eyes."

76
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:37,209
"Has shown you to me."

77
00:08:37,501 --> 00:08:41,167
"I am lost in you."

78
00:08:41,542 --> 00:08:44,584
"Your magic has pulled my heart."

79
00:08:45,001 --> 00:08:51,126
"Your laughter has trapped me."

80
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:54,626
"I am in you, I am with you."

81
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:57,167
"I am in you."

82
00:08:57,376 --> 00:09:02,459
"It's only your love I want."

83
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:07,334
"I am in you, I am with you."

84
00:09:07,417 --> 00:09:11,292
"I am in love with you."

85
00:09:11,792 --> 00:09:16,376
"A dream that touched my eyes."

86
00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:59,834
"It's only been joy till now."

87
00:10:00,126 --> 00:10:05,292
"I don't know why, it’s gone far away."

88
00:10:05,917 --> 00:10:08,084
"Has darkness overshadowed the light?"

89
00:10:08,376 --> 00:10:10,709
"The laughter has disappeared."

90
00:10:10,917 --> 00:10:15,209
"Pain is my only companion now."

91
00:10:15,376 --> 00:10:20,292
"A wound has started within me."

92
00:10:20,376 --> 00:10:25,834
"Only time will show the way."

93
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,292
"Are we still one?"

94
00:10:28,334 --> 00:10:30,709
"Is your silence all that we have?"

95
00:10:30,792 --> 00:10:36,001
"But it’s only your thoughts with me."

96
00:10:36,209 --> 00:10:39,042
"Am I not with you?"

97
00:10:40,334 --> 00:10:44,917
"A dream that touched my eyes."

98
00:11:09,042 --> 00:11:14,042
"Moon! Oh Moon!
Won't you come behind me?"

99
00:11:14,126 --> 00:11:16,501
"Are you going to hide there?"

100
00:11:16,584 --> 00:11:19,084
"Oh moon light!"

101
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,626
"Won't you come too?"

102
00:11:21,709 --> 00:11:24,209
"Don't you want to join me?"

103
00:11:39,584 --> 00:11:41,376
Krishna, what is this?

104
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:45,001
From now on,
I will put a rupee for every time...

105
00:11:45,084 --> 00:11:47,376
...we fight I will buy
something with that money.

106
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:57,001
Why are you blaming me?
It’s not only in my hands.

107
00:11:57,209 --> 00:12:01,334
I keep telling her I'm sorry, I'm
sorry at least a hundred times a day.

108
00:12:01,792 --> 00:12:04,001
Saying that you're sorry
a hundred times a day is fine...

109
00:12:04,084 --> 00:12:06,917
...but do you tell her
'I Love You' at least once a day?

110
00:12:07,084 --> 00:12:08,334
Once a week?

111
00:12:08,917 --> 00:12:10,084
A month?

112
00:12:10,542 --> 00:12:13,751
Have you ever told her at
least once since you've been married?

113
00:12:14,126 --> 00:12:16,626
Ours was an arranged marriage.
She is my wife.

114
00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:18,084
Oh, sorry.

115
00:12:18,167 --> 00:12:20,292
So if she's your wife you
don't have to tell her. Is that it?

116
00:12:20,376 --> 00:12:21,876
What are you saying?

117
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:24,167
You know how much I love her.

118
00:12:24,251 --> 00:12:27,292
It doesn't matter if I know it,
or the people around you know it.

119
00:12:27,376 --> 00:12:28,751
Your wife needs to know.

120
00:12:29,417 --> 00:12:30,917
And you need to say it.

121
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:33,042
It’s not like love exists
only if you say it...

122
00:12:33,126 --> 00:12:34,709
...but when you love someone,
you must say it.

123
00:12:36,417 --> 00:12:37,792
Gift her something.

124
00:12:37,876 --> 00:12:43,167
It should be something that she loves,
but she should not know that you know.

125
00:12:43,376 --> 00:12:44,167
Surprise her.

126
00:12:44,251 --> 00:12:49,417
Jawaharlal Nehru was
born on November 14th and...

127
00:12:49,501 --> 00:12:50,959
What is this word mom?

128
00:12:52,251 --> 00:12:53,334
You keep reading.

129
00:12:53,584 --> 00:12:57,084
F O U G H T, what is it?

130
00:12:57,417 --> 00:12:58,334
Keep going.

131
00:13:01,292 --> 00:13:06,542
"Wonder where this
distance will take us."

132
00:13:06,626 --> 00:13:11,584
"Wonder when this
silence will leave us."

133
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,751
"Will this bond disappear?"

134
00:13:14,834 --> 00:13:17,209
"Will only this pain between us grow?"

135
00:13:17,292 --> 00:13:21,501
"Will our love only be
the words written on water?"

136
00:13:21,792 --> 00:13:26,792
"I wonder why we
go on living like this."

137
00:13:26,876 --> 00:13:31,751
"For only our tears to haunt us."

138
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:34,626
"Should I come along with you?"

139
00:13:34,709 --> 00:13:42,501
"Shall I become your shadow
even if your anger keeps following us?"

140
00:13:42,584 --> 00:13:45,042
"Am I not with you?"

141
00:14:26,376 --> 00:14:28,667
What is this Krishna?
It must have been a mistake.

142
00:14:28,751 --> 00:14:30,001
Is this a mistake? It's negligence.

143
00:14:30,084 --> 00:14:31,917
It’s not Krishna.
Just listen to me please.

144
00:14:32,001 --> 00:14:34,876
How many times did I tell you
not to put Bittu's name on the cake?

145
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,542
I told the baker Krishna,
but he put it out of habit.

146
00:14:38,626 --> 00:14:41,126
What? You said don't,
but the baker did it anyway. Is that it?

147
00:14:41,376 --> 00:14:43,251
What I'm saying is that
everyone writes the name, right?

148
00:14:43,334 --> 00:14:45,209
So out of habit he must have put it.

149
00:14:45,292 --> 00:14:46,667
How does he know Bittu's name?

150
00:14:46,751 --> 00:14:48,667
You make the mistake,
and you put the blame on everyone else.

151
00:14:48,751 --> 00:14:52,084
Krishna, I understand my mistakes.
I really don't know how to tell you.

152
00:14:52,167 --> 00:14:55,751
All day I've been trying to tell you.
I even got you a gift.

153
00:14:55,834 --> 00:14:59,376
Your words, your lies,
and now you've got gifts to cheat me?

154
00:14:59,584 --> 00:15:01,667
What is this Krishna?
Why are we fighting?

155
00:15:01,917 --> 00:15:03,917
Every day, however careful I am,
something or the other happens.

156
00:15:04,001 --> 00:15:05,334
Is this why we got married?

157
00:15:05,417 --> 00:15:06,251
What?

158
00:15:06,501 --> 00:15:09,042
Instead of staying together...

159
00:15:09,126 --> 00:15:10,542
...fighting and dying like this,
splitting up is better.

160
00:15:10,917 --> 00:15:13,584
Everyday some fight or the other,
some tension or the other.

161
00:15:13,667 --> 00:15:14,626
What did you say?

162
00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:17,959
Tensions.

163
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:20,542
What did you say before that?

164
00:15:22,376 --> 00:15:23,709
You said we should split up right?

165
00:15:24,251 --> 00:15:26,167
Krishna that is not my intention.

166
00:15:26,251 --> 00:15:27,042
You said it.

167
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:28,584
I didn't mean that Krishna.

168
00:15:28,667 --> 00:15:29,334
You want to split up right?

169
00:15:29,417 --> 00:15:31,334
I didn't say that at all Krishna.
- Lets split up.

170
00:15:31,542 --> 00:15:34,209
If the thought wasn't in your head,
you wouldn't have said it right?

171
00:15:34,292 --> 00:15:36,751
Krishna that is not my intention.
Just listen to me once.

172
00:15:36,834 --> 00:15:38,834
You should have just told me.
Why this torture?

173
00:15:39,001 --> 00:15:40,584
Krishna what are you saying?

174
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:41,959
You be happy.

175
00:15:43,126 --> 00:15:45,417
I will not come between both of you.

176
00:15:45,751 --> 00:15:46,876
Both? What both?

177
00:15:48,459 --> 00:15:52,292
We will meet a lawyer tomorrow
itself and apply for a divorce.

178
00:16:34,876 --> 00:16:35,626
Mom.

179
00:16:36,876 --> 00:16:37,751
Mom.

180
00:16:37,834 --> 00:16:40,209
Mom and dad have gone out.

181
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:43,959
They will be back in an hour.
Milk is on the table. Drink it up.

182
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:51,042
Hello.

183
00:16:51,126 --> 00:16:53,459
Hello madam, this is Murthi speaking.

184
00:16:53,542 --> 00:16:55,042
I have performed
the 'puja' as you wanted.

185
00:16:55,126 --> 00:16:56,667
When do you want me
to bring the 'prasadam'?

186
00:16:56,751 --> 00:16:58,542
Mother isn't at home.

187
00:16:58,626 --> 00:17:03,001
Oh Bittu it’s you.
Alright then, I shall call back.

188
00:17:03,084 --> 00:17:03,876
Okay.

189
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:39,126
Now are you happy?

190
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:41,001
What?

191
00:17:42,167 --> 00:17:43,584
There is no one to stop you.

192
00:17:44,751 --> 00:17:45,876
No wife...

193
00:17:46,417 --> 00:17:47,376
...no son.

194
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,876
From now you'll be happy right?
With her?

195
00:17:50,709 --> 00:17:52,001
What are you saying?

196
00:17:52,292 --> 00:17:55,626
We may fight. We might not get along.

197
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:57,792
But Bittu?

198
00:17:59,251 --> 00:18:01,167
Did you think about him?

199
00:18:02,667 --> 00:18:04,001
Are you that selfish?

200
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:09,834
For marrying a person like you,
divorce isn't enough. I should be dead.

201
00:18:09,917 --> 00:18:10,876
Krishna.

202
00:18:11,251 --> 00:18:12,084
Radha.

203
00:18:27,459 --> 00:18:30,667
ACCIDENT PRONE ZONE

204
00:18:40,251 --> 00:18:45,292
Krishna.
Krishna, Krishna. Get up Krishna.

205
00:18:45,376 --> 00:18:48,126
Open your eyes, Krishna.
Please Krishna, wake up.

206
00:18:48,209 --> 00:18:52,542
Come on Krishna. Come on, come on.

207
00:18:52,834 --> 00:18:57,334
Krishna I cannot live without you.
I cannot live without Bittu and you.

208
00:18:58,626 --> 00:18:59,917
Krishna, wake up.

209
00:19:33,209 --> 00:19:37,876
God created Human Beings,
he also created Love, and the Mind.

210
00:19:38,167 --> 00:19:41,417
Why was God, who was able to keep
a limit to the duration of human life...

211
00:19:41,501 --> 00:19:45,251
...unable to keep limits on the Mind,
and on Love?

212
00:19:45,542 --> 00:19:49,667
That is why, to further eternal love...

213
00:19:49,751 --> 00:19:54,417
...God keeps bringing some people back
to life again, and again, and again.

214
00:20:05,501 --> 00:20:10,376
FEW YEARS LATER...

215
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:15,376
We are proudly hosting
this award function...

216
00:20:15,459 --> 00:20:20,751
...in the financial capital
of our country MUMBAI.

217
00:20:21,042 --> 00:20:24,876
This year the Business
Man of the year award goes to...

218
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:29,792
...the CMD of Radha and Krishna
group of Industries, Mr. Nageshwara Rao.

219
00:20:37,626 --> 00:20:40,792
I would now like to
speak a few words about him.

220
00:20:41,126 --> 00:20:44,542
Having lost his parents
at the tender age of six...

221
00:20:44,626 --> 00:20:47,959
...the personal tragedy did not stop
him from excelling in his academics...

222
00:20:48,042 --> 00:20:50,876
...he is an alumni of IIT, Mumbai.

223
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:53,584
He started his own business...

224
00:20:53,667 --> 00:20:56,084
...thereby fulfilling
his desire to be his own boss.

225
00:20:56,167 --> 00:20:58,959
In 5 years,
with a workforce of 55000 people...

226
00:20:59,042 --> 00:21:01,917
...and a yearly turnover
of 1500 crores...

227
00:21:02,001 --> 00:21:07,209
...the company entered the Fortune
500 list. This not an ordinary feat.

228
00:21:07,292 --> 00:21:10,626
On a lighter note, when asked
about his personal life at an event.

229
00:21:10,834 --> 00:21:13,751
Where he was declared one of the most
eligible bachelors in the country...

230
00:21:13,834 --> 00:21:16,042
...he remarked that
he was already married...

231
00:21:16,126 --> 00:21:19,126
...and that his company
was his wife and one true love.

232
00:21:19,209 --> 00:21:22,876
Please welcome the businessman
of the year, Mr. Nageshwar Rao.

233
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:34,334
Our country needs more people like you.

234
00:21:34,417 --> 00:21:35,501
Thank you sir.
- Congratulations.

235
00:21:35,584 --> 00:21:36,417
It’s an honor.

236
00:21:47,626 --> 00:21:52,376
Mom, Dad.
Missing you guys so much today.

237
00:21:53,334 --> 00:21:56,167
Wherever you both are,
I hope I've made you proud today.

238
00:21:56,917 --> 00:22:01,126
Mom, I've made all
your dreams come true.

239
00:22:01,917 --> 00:22:05,292
Without your blessings, I know
this would not have been possible.

240
00:22:06,167 --> 00:22:08,626
Even though you both are not with me...

241
00:22:08,709 --> 00:22:11,709
...I have lived every minute
thinking you are right here.

242
00:22:12,167 --> 00:22:18,876
But today, while receiving the
award from the President, I missed you.

243
00:22:24,334 --> 00:22:27,126
MUMBAI AIRPORT

244
00:22:33,292 --> 00:22:34,709
Excuse me.
- Ladies first.

245
00:22:34,792 --> 00:22:37,292
It's okay.
- No, no. I always insist ladies first.

246
00:22:37,376 --> 00:22:38,626
Please.

00:22:55,126 --> 00:22:59,834
Hello there,

249
00:23:43,709 --> 00:23:45,042
Dad.

250
00:23:48,501 --> 00:23:50,376
May I help you, sir?
- Can I get the bottle of water, please.

251
00:23:50,459 --> 00:23:51,501
Sure.

252
00:24:11,126 --> 00:24:14,709
Do you know why our elders
have always say Ladies first.

253
00:24:15,167 --> 00:24:19,084
When ladies walk ahead of us it
is for us to stand behind them admiring.

254
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:30,417
Excuse me.

255
00:24:31,542 --> 00:24:32,792
Are you going to Hyderabad.

256
00:24:32,876 --> 00:24:36,667
Me? Gannavaram, Gannavaram, Gannavaram.

257
00:24:37,959 --> 00:24:39,792
Isn't this the flight to Hyderabad?

258
00:24:40,001 --> 00:24:43,501
Excuse me I think I am on the wrong
flight excuse me wrong flight, hello.

259
00:24:43,584 --> 00:24:44,917
No, no this is the correct flight.

260
00:24:45,001 --> 00:24:46,959
Then why did you agree
when I said Gannavaram.

261
00:24:47,042 --> 00:24:48,417
This is the flight to Hyderabad right.
- Hyderabad.

262
00:24:48,501 --> 00:24:49,417
Then okay.

263
00:24:55,334 --> 00:24:56,417
Excuse me.

264
00:24:57,084 --> 00:24:59,167
Where do you stay in Hyderabad?

265
00:24:59,792 --> 00:25:00,709
Hostel.

266
00:25:03,542 --> 00:25:04,792
Which college?

267
00:25:07,459 --> 00:25:08,292
St. Xavier's.

268
00:25:08,376 --> 00:25:10,292
Oh! St. Xavier's.

269
00:25:14,001 --> 00:25:15,209
Which group?

270
00:25:19,876 --> 00:25:23,084
Do not tell anybody naxal group.

271
00:25:31,917 --> 00:25:32,792
Excuse me.

272
00:25:33,876 --> 00:25:34,959
I am Nageshwar Rao.

273
00:25:35,501 --> 00:25:37,417
Hi, I am Nagarjuna.

274
00:25:38,334 --> 00:25:41,084
You have told me so
much right I am very happy.

275
00:25:41,167 --> 00:25:43,751
From now I won’t eat your
brains with any more questions...

276
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:45,876
...peacefully enjoy your music.

277
00:26:22,251 --> 00:26:25,084
What is this? What is happening here?

278
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:29,001
What is with the phone photo and camera?

279
00:26:29,084 --> 00:26:30,876
Hello what is going on?
What are you doing?

280
00:26:31,209 --> 00:26:32,042
Nothing just casually.

281
00:26:32,376 --> 00:26:36,251
Casually? Hello you were cheek to
cheek with me and you call that casual.

282
00:26:36,501 --> 00:26:38,251
Oh God no please
do not misunderstand me.

283
00:26:38,334 --> 00:26:40,959
You make the mistake and
then tell me not to misunderstand.

284
00:26:41,209 --> 00:26:43,417
No, no there is something fishy here.

285
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:45,959
No, no this is just for my memories.

286
00:26:46,334 --> 00:26:48,709
Memories?
I do not want any such memories.

287
00:26:49,126 --> 00:26:51,542
I thought that only
women do not have security...

288
00:26:51,626 --> 00:26:52,792
...but it seems that
men are also not safe.

289
00:26:52,876 --> 00:26:56,626
What is your intention? I cannot
jump out of a closed flight is that it.

290
00:26:56,876 --> 00:26:58,626
Excuse me, ma'am.
I want to change my seat.

291
00:26:58,709 --> 00:27:00,584
No, no. Actually I want
to change the goddamn flight.

292
00:27:00,667 --> 00:27:01,626
I am sorry. I am sorry.
- Please, please.

293
00:27:02,167 --> 00:27:03,209
I will sit far away.

294
00:27:03,584 --> 00:27:04,376
Far away.

295
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:10,126
More that leg keep that hand there.

296
00:27:11,792 --> 00:27:13,084
Maintain this distance.

297
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:17,001
Oh, God! Crazy guy.

298
00:27:19,167 --> 00:27:21,292
How dare he come that close to me?

299
00:27:23,376 --> 00:27:24,667
Useless one!

300
00:27:41,834 --> 00:27:44,584
"Ladies and Gentlemen! The flight..."

301
00:27:45,667 --> 00:27:47,667
Where is he? Where? Where?

302
00:27:47,751 --> 00:27:48,959
"Please wait in 013 gate."

303
00:27:56,501 --> 00:27:58,417
Hello, Mr. Nagarjuna. It is me.

00:28:02,626 --> 00:28:03,751

One minutes. One minutes, please.

309
00:28:05,376 --> 00:28:07,542
Oh God, damn it. Where is my bag?

310
00:28:08,042 --> 00:28:09,709
Why is he following me like this?

311
00:28:12,084 --> 00:28:13,626
Hello, Mr. Nagarjuna.

312
00:28:13,709 --> 00:28:15,792

00:28:39,876 --> 00:28:42,334
BITTU'S 6TH BIRTHDAY

00:28:42,626 --> 00:28:44,417
Happy, happy, happy birthday, Bittu.

315
00:28:44,626 --> 00:28:47,292
There is no one else
more dangerous than you.

316
00:28:47,376 --> 00:28:49,751
But you have to become
even more dangerous, okay?

317
00:28:50,209 --> 00:28:53,001
You should break all the gifts
I got you in a week only...

318
00:28:53,084 --> 00:28:55,792
...then will you get new ones.

319
00:28:55,876 --> 00:28:56,834
That is enough turn it here.

320
00:28:58,959 --> 00:29:01,334
Happy happy birthday Kanna.

321
00:29:01,417 --> 00:29:03,709
Has it already been 6 years Bittu.

322
00:29:03,792 --> 00:29:07,542
Since you were born till now.
I do not know where time has gone.

323
00:29:08,001 --> 00:29:11,626
Before you I do not
remember anything at all.

324
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:14,709
You are the best boy
in the whole world dear.

325
00:29:15,001 --> 00:29:18,501
You have to grow even bigger
study well help everyone...

326
00:29:18,584 --> 00:29:23,251
...everyone should say Bittu
is a good boy and make us proud.

327
00:29:23,334 --> 00:29:26,292
And thank you, thank you
for selecting me as your mother.

328
00:29:34,209 --> 00:29:35,334
Buddy.

329
00:29:36,459 --> 00:29:38,667
If someone ever told me that
this is possible...

330
00:29:38,751 --> 00:29:40,584
...I would have never believed it.

331
00:29:41,876 --> 00:29:43,417
But I saw Dad.

332
00:29:43,667 --> 00:29:45,001
He sat right next to me.

333
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:47,292
I spoke to him.

334
00:29:48,167 --> 00:29:50,376
It was a wonderful moment.

335
00:29:50,626 --> 00:29:52,334
Just fantastic, Buddy.

336
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:59,334
If Dad is reborn then should
not Mom also be reborn somewhere.

337
00:30:00,501 --> 00:30:02,084
I should search for her right.

338
00:30:03,959 --> 00:30:05,251
I will search, Buddy.

339
00:30:05,584 --> 00:30:08,959
Wherever she is I will
search until I find her.

340
00:31:18,876 --> 00:31:19,667
Mom.

341
00:31:48,542 --> 00:31:51,126
Whenever you need me you
just have to say Mom out loud...

342
00:31:51,167 --> 00:31:52,417
...and I will be
right there next to you.

343
00:31:54,959 --> 00:31:56,126
I've come have not I?

344
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:41,917
The bookstore is somewhere,
here lets go there.

345
00:33:20,917 --> 00:33:23,042
Excuse me. Have you met before?

346
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:24,292
Sorry.

347
00:33:24,334 --> 00:33:26,334
We have met somewhere, have not we?

348
00:33:28,626 --> 00:33:33,751
I feel like we have met
before like I know you quite well.

349
00:33:35,376 --> 00:33:37,084
Some connection.

350
00:33:39,376 --> 00:33:40,667
No.

351
00:33:42,001 --> 00:33:44,334
This cannot be the first
time we are meeting right.

352
00:33:45,501 --> 00:33:46,959
Do not you feel like you have seen me.

353
00:33:47,834 --> 00:33:49,959
When I feel like I
have seen you before...

354
00:33:50,042 --> 00:33:52,001
...then you also should feel
like you have seen me before right.

355
00:33:52,626 --> 00:33:53,709
Do not you remember me.

356
00:33:53,959 --> 00:33:55,167
Please think!

357
00:33:56,084 --> 00:33:57,751
Some link?

358
00:34:01,084 --> 00:34:02,126
Please think!

359
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:05,417
Priya is this the book you
were looking for? This is it right.

360
00:34:06,084 --> 00:34:08,417
Chinni is about 6 years old right?
- Yes.

361
00:34:14,042 --> 00:34:15,376
Then this is the perfect gift.

362
00:34:15,417 --> 00:34:17,167
He will like it right?
- Shall I buy it?

363
00:34:17,709 --> 00:34:20,084
You can buy it confidently,
it is a fantastic book.

364
00:34:21,251 --> 00:34:23,042
You know this book.
- Yes.

365
00:34:23,376 --> 00:34:25,959
When I was little my mother
used to read it out to me.

366
00:34:26,167 --> 00:34:27,542
Otherwise I would not sleep.

367
00:34:27,626 --> 00:34:31,626
It became such a habit that
even now if I cannot sleep I read it.

368
00:34:32,876 --> 00:34:35,001
It makes me feel like
my mother is right next to me.

369
00:34:35,042 --> 00:34:36,751
Even now your mother
is right next to you.

370
00:34:38,667 --> 00:34:40,376
I am talking about
the book in your hands.

371
00:34:43,376 --> 00:34:46,042
You seem very attached to your mother.

372
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:49,417
She is the most wonderful
person I have ever known in my life.

373
00:34:49,917 --> 00:34:53,834
My Dad sat next to me for
two hours but could not recognize me.

374
00:34:54,042 --> 00:34:57,209
But my mother she came searching for me.

375
00:34:57,792 --> 00:35:02,417
I mean the connection between a mother
and child is a magical connection right?

376
00:35:02,459 --> 00:35:03,251
True.

377
00:35:05,001 --> 00:35:06,084
What are you doing?

378
00:35:06,751 --> 00:35:09,001
I run a business in cyber city.

379
00:35:09,084 --> 00:35:12,126
No not that,
what is your plan after this?

380
00:35:12,209 --> 00:35:13,292
Nothing, nothing.

381
00:35:13,584 --> 00:35:15,459
I am starving.
Would you like to join us for lunch?

382
00:35:15,542 --> 00:35:16,542
Me?
- Priya.

383
00:35:17,251 --> 00:35:18,751
One minute.

384
00:35:19,167 --> 00:35:22,626
Have you gone mad?
You are calling a stranger for lunch.

385
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:30,334
Hi. I am sorry I didn't
introduce myself. I am Priya.

386
00:35:30,792 --> 00:35:31,917
I am Nageshwar Rao.

387
00:35:32,001 --> 00:35:33,959
This is Divya.
- Hi.

388
00:35:34,001 --> 00:35:35,709
Now he is no longer
a stranger to us right?

389
00:35:37,292 --> 00:35:39,834
Now Divya,
would you like to join us for lunch?

390
00:35:39,917 --> 00:35:41,042
Please.

391
00:35:42,126 --> 00:35:44,959
Of all the women in the world
my mother is the most beautiful.

392
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:49,167
Most guys talk about girls
all the time but listening to a guy...

393
00:35:49,251 --> 00:35:54,084
...talk about his mother for
so long with such love first time.

394
00:35:54,876 --> 00:35:58,417
Talking about your mother
is the same as talking to her right?

395
00:35:58,959 --> 00:36:00,126
Well said.

396
00:36:00,751 --> 00:36:02,959
Priya, let’s go it is getting late.

397
00:36:03,959 --> 00:36:05,209
What is your hurry?

398
00:36:05,251 --> 00:36:07,542
We have an exam tomorrow
have you forgotten.

399
00:36:07,667 --> 00:36:10,751
Whether we study or not we wont
understand it then why the tension.

400
00:36:11,209 --> 00:36:12,251
What exam?

401
00:36:12,292 --> 00:36:13,459

402
00:36:14,251 --> 00:36:15,417
What is the topic?

403
00:36:15,584 --> 00:36:17,501
Theory of diminishing.

404
00:36:17,834 --> 00:36:19,626
Marginal Utility.

405
00:36:20,209 --> 00:36:20,751
Do you know it?

406
00:36:20,792 --> 00:36:22,167
It is really easy.

407
00:36:22,251 --> 00:36:27,251
Hello excuse me may I borrow your pen?
I will explain it to you It is so easy.

408
00:37:01,709 --> 00:37:02,917
That is all?
- Yes.

409
00:37:02,959 --> 00:37:05,667
You got it right?
Otherwise I will explain it again.

410
00:37:05,876 --> 00:37:07,334
I have clearly understood.

411
00:37:07,417 --> 00:37:09,792
I can actually go right
now and write the exam.

412
00:37:09,876 --> 00:37:13,001
Oh my God! I am going to
pass economics for the first time.

413
00:37:13,042 --> 00:37:15,001
Priya lets go it is getting late.

414
00:37:16,417 --> 00:37:18,751
Oh my God!
Nageshwar we have to leave now...

415
00:37:18,834 --> 00:37:21,292

00:37:21,334 --> 00:37:22,501
Okay bye.
- Okay mother.

417
00:37:22,584 --> 00:37:23,792

419
00:37:27,834 --> 00:37:31,209
You took the trouble to teach me and do
not you want to find out how I did it.

420
00:37:31,292 --> 00:37:32,209
Take it down.

421
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:35,376

422
00:37:35,417 --> 00:37:36,376
Okay.

423
00:37:36,459 --> 00:37:40,501

424
00:37:40,542 --> 00:37:41,709

00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:43,251

428
00:38:47,459 --> 00:38:51,167
What my sons, I say what
the heaven are you doing here?

429
00:38:51,376 --> 00:38:54,917
There are only ten days left for
our colleges Deep Woods youth festival.

430
00:38:54,959 --> 00:38:57,667
Till now you haven't been able
to raise any sponsorship for it.

431
00:38:57,751 --> 00:38:59,667
You stupid.. My Lord.

432
00:39:00,417 --> 00:39:02,876
That's because
we are so focused on our studies...

433
00:39:02,959 --> 00:39:04,292
...we even study in our sleep, Father.

434
00:39:04,334 --> 00:39:08,334
A student who passes at least
one subject a year can say this.

435
00:39:09,251 --> 00:39:11,751
I have told you so many times
about how prestigious this event...

436
00:39:11,834 --> 00:39:12,834
...is for me and our college.

437
00:39:12,876 --> 00:39:14,042
Praise the Lord, Father.

438
00:39:14,126 --> 00:39:16,542
May the Lord be praised. Come in child.

439
00:39:18,792 --> 00:39:21,251
Oh sorry Father. I interrupted
your meeting I will come back later.

440
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:23,959
Oh that's no problem.
We will wait. Ladies first, please.

441
00:39:24,292 --> 00:39:25,501
Thank you.

442
00:39:26,626 --> 00:39:29,376
This is a list of students
of attendance below 30 percent.

443
00:39:29,459 --> 00:39:32,292
All departments?
- Yes Father. All departments.

444
00:39:32,376 --> 00:39:33,709
Thank you my child.

445
00:39:33,751 --> 00:39:35,584
I have a class. Praise the Lord Father.

446
00:39:35,834 --> 00:39:37,542
May the Lord be praised, my child.

447
00:39:37,626 --> 00:39:39,501
Idiots your names are in there too.

448
00:39:47,626 --> 00:39:48,959
Oh Lord!

449
00:39:50,459 --> 00:39:51,751
My son.

450
00:39:51,834 --> 00:39:52,917
My dear sunflower.

451
00:39:54,251 --> 00:39:58,251
Stop staring and get me
sponsorship for the festival...

452
00:39:58,334 --> 00:40:00,542
...otherwise I will tear you all apart.

453
00:40:00,626 --> 00:40:02,251
Praise the Lord Father. Praise the Lord.

454
00:40:02,334 --> 00:40:04,667
May the Lord be praised. Get out.

455
00:40:04,917 --> 00:40:07,209
Hell! He makes us
look worse than beggars.

456
00:40:07,251 --> 00:40:09,042
What are they doing
with our fees and donations.

457
00:40:09,126 --> 00:40:11,709
Cannot he use those
funds for the festival.

458
00:40:11,751 --> 00:40:12,959
May the Lord be praised.

459
00:40:13,042 --> 00:40:14,001
He might be transferring
to his personal account.

460
00:40:14,084 --> 00:40:15,792
That's right.
- Boys. Silence.

461
00:40:15,834 --> 00:40:21,334
I do not understand what to do about
these sponsorships and this festival.

462
00:40:35,459 --> 00:40:37,334
Guys I know him.

463
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:38,126
Who?

464
00:40:38,209 --> 00:40:40,376
I told you about the
guy I ran into on the flight.

465
00:40:40,417 --> 00:40:42,584
Yes, yes the one who was cheek
to cheek with you and wanted your photo.

466
00:40:42,626 --> 00:40:45,126
What is he doing on the
cover page of a magazine?

467
00:40:46,084 --> 00:40:48,751
Look. He is the chairman of
Radha & Krishna group of industries.

468
00:40:49,626 --> 00:40:51,917
Number one businessman in India.

469
00:40:52,084 --> 00:40:59,959
These projects funds his charitable

470
00:41:00,001 --> 00:41:02,209
The road side tea shop
owner is calling us beggars.

471
00:41:02,292 --> 00:41:03,542
Will this millionaire
even let us inside his office.

472
00:41:03,584 --> 00:41:06,751
Let’s try. Anyway beggars
cannot be choosers. Let’s go.

473
00:41:11,292 --> 00:41:15,001
We have to, We will try hard and
get at least 50000 rupees out of him.

474
00:41:15,042 --> 00:41:18,792
Lighting,
sound, invitations we can finish.

475
00:41:18,834 --> 00:41:19,959
50,000?

476
00:41:20,042 --> 00:41:22,167
Why do not you ask for his entire
property. You good for nothing idiot.

477
00:41:22,251 --> 00:41:24,042
Look here I am telling you
it’s a waste of petrol coming here.

478
00:41:24,126 --> 00:41:24,834
We won’t get a single paisa.

479
00:41:24,917 --> 00:41:26,459
Both of you just shut up and follow me.

480
00:41:26,751 --> 00:41:30,251
All your hard-work.
And cash we paid, everything is paid off.

481
00:41:30,459 --> 00:41:31,751
At least try to get the
money for petrol to get back.

482
00:41:31,792 --> 00:41:33,084
Just chill let me take care of this.

483
00:41:33,167 --> 00:41:34,167
Okay.

484
00:41:37,751 --> 00:41:38,792
Excuse me.

485
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,042
We need to meet Mr. Nageshwar Rao.

486
00:41:45,084 --> 00:41:47,084
Sir is in a meeting
with foreign delegates.

487
00:41:47,126 --> 00:41:48,376
No problem.
Sir we need just two minutes.

488
00:41:48,459 --> 00:41:50,042
We will say hi and leave.
Where is he now?

489
00:41:50,084 --> 00:41:50,917
How will 2 minutes be enough?

490
00:41:51,001 --> 00:41:51,834
We need at least one and a half hours...

491
00:41:51,917 --> 00:41:53,084
...we have to discuss
many matters personally, right?

492
00:41:53,126 --> 00:41:56,001
Just chill. We will say
two minutes here go inside...

493
00:41:56,084 --> 00:41:57,626
Okay.
- ...and park ourselves there relax.

494
00:41:57,667 --> 00:41:58,876
Where is he sir?

495
00:41:59,084 --> 00:42:00,251
Do you have an appointment?

496
00:42:00,292 --> 00:42:01,876
Appointment?
- No is it necessary.

497
00:42:01,959 --> 00:42:04,042
Hey it seems we have to take
an appointment where do we take it.

498
00:42:04,084 --> 00:42:06,876
Take an appointment now. We won’t even
get the appointment of his secretary.

499
00:42:06,917 --> 00:42:08,667
What rubbish. Who is his secretary.

500
00:42:08,751 --> 00:42:10,459
He will be some useless fellow
roaming around with nothing to do.

501
00:42:10,501 --> 00:42:12,042
Excuse me who is his secretary?

502
00:42:14,334 --> 00:42:17,709
His secretary is me.

503
00:42:19,167 --> 00:42:22,959
Oh look he is the secretary,
he is the jobless one listening to us.

504
00:42:24,001 --> 00:42:25,917
Sir are you the secretary?

505
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:27,334
Yes I am the secretary.

506
00:42:27,709 --> 00:42:31,584
But leave that who
let you into this office.

507
00:42:31,667 --> 00:42:33,584
Security. Security.
- Sir.

508
00:42:33,834 --> 00:42:35,126
Security.
- Sir.

509
00:42:35,209 --> 00:42:36,751
It is not like that, sir.
- We should start the work...

510
00:42:36,834 --> 00:42:37,334
Sir.. sir.

511
00:42:37,417 --> 00:42:39,876
Who allowed these useless
idiots into the office.

512
00:42:39,959 --> 00:42:42,709
We are from St. Xavier's College sir, we
are having a youth festival in college.

513
00:42:42,792 --> 00:42:46,709
For a youth festival.
You think my Boss is so jobless.

514
00:42:46,792 --> 00:42:48,376
It does not matter
if he comes or not.

515
00:42:48,459 --> 00:42:49,751
If he gives us
the sponsorship it will do.

516
00:42:49,834 --> 00:42:50,751
Sponsorship?
- Yeah.

517
00:42:50,792 --> 00:42:51,667
How much should he give?

518
00:42:51,834 --> 00:42:52,792
Not much.
Just about 50000 that's enough.

519
00:42:52,876 --> 00:42:55,542
That's it.
- You step aside you come here.

520
00:42:56,209 --> 00:42:57,001
How much do you want?

521
00:42:57,167 --> 00:42:57,834
50,000. Just 50000.

522
00:42:57,876 --> 00:43:00,251
50000 will that do or do you want more.

523
00:43:00,334 --> 00:43:02,001
If you want he will write
over this entire building to you.

524
00:43:02,084 --> 00:43:04,126
If you can manage that
we will be eternally grateful...

525
00:43:04,209 --> 00:43:05,667
...we will give you a 2 percent cut.

526
00:43:05,751 --> 00:43:06,626
2 percent?
- Even you have to survive right?

527
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:08,584
Oh you will give me 2 percent is it?
- Yes.

528
00:43:08,667 --> 00:43:10,667
You think I am a broker?
You think I am a broker?

00:43:10,751 --> 00:43:12,334
It is going to be.. - I know what
you will do with this money.

00:43:12,417 --> 00:43:13,459
You will get drunk...

531
00:43:13,542 --> 00:43:14,667
...and go around the city
with your girlfriends.

532
00:43:14,751 --> 00:43:15,376
Just excuse me!

533
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:17,001
I know you guys very well.

534
00:43:17,084 --> 00:43:19,376
How dare you offer 2 percent to me?
- Please spare us, sir.

535
00:43:23,792 --> 00:43:24,542
Dad.

536
00:43:27,084 --> 00:43:29,334
Sorry sir he did not
know what he was saying.

537
00:43:29,417 --> 00:43:31,334
Leave it sir.
- Girish Karnad. What are you doing?

538
00:43:31,417 --> 00:43:33,501
Why are you here sir?
I will take care of these fools.

539
00:43:39,001 --> 00:43:41,126
You? Here? When did you come?

540
00:43:41,209 --> 00:43:42,584

He told us that you were
in some important meeting.

543
00:43:47,626 --> 00:43:49,376
Oh that's nothing just
some silly meetings.

544
00:43:49,542 --> 00:43:52,459
When one employs fools like
this they are bound to cause a scene.

545
00:43:52,542 --> 00:43:53,751
Okay. I get it.
- Please come!

546
00:43:53,834 --> 00:43:56,001

Proud?

585
00:45:30,917 --> 00:45:32,751
He is only the college president.

586
00:45:32,834 --> 00:45:35,001
Does Mr. Bittu think he
is the President of America.

587
00:45:35,167 --> 00:45:38,126
Actually we are conducting
a youth festival this month.

588
00:45:38,209 --> 00:45:41,334
We tried a lot to get sponsorship,
but no one is giving us any money.

589
00:45:41,417 --> 00:45:46,292
You tried a lot to get sponsorship?
In this heat, and pollution.

590
00:45:46,792 --> 00:45:47,876
But no money.

591
00:45:48,042 --> 00:45:50,542
If you had made just
one phone call to me.

592
00:45:51,876 --> 00:45:53,292
How much do you need? Tell me.

One crore.

598
00:46:07,709 --> 00:46:11,542
No, no. 50 lakhs will be enough.

599
00:46:11,626 --> 00:46:15,417
Forget 50 lakhs. It’s too little.
I'll give you 75, average of the two.

Okay? No problem right?

601
00:46:17,626 --> 00:46:19,626
You shouldn't hesitate to
ask me for such a small amount.

602
00:46:21,042 --> 00:46:25,292
When you are organizing the event, how
should it be? It must be extraordinary.

603
00:46:25,501 --> 00:46:27,084
Right.
- Okay. Okay.

00:46:29,501 --> 00:46:30,251

He's my best friend.

688
00:49:46,542 --> 00:49:49,042
If I tell you we became best
friends in one day, will you believe it?

689
00:49:49,126 --> 00:49:49,667
Blood test.

690
00:49:49,751 --> 00:49:51,751
No copying, no memory slips. I passed.

691
00:49:51,834 --> 00:49:52,501
X-ray.

692
00:49:52,584 --> 00:49:54,584
Nageshwar always talks
so highly of his mother.

693
00:49:54,667 --> 00:49:56,501
That's enough to judge his character.

694
00:49:56,584 --> 00:49:57,209
ECG.

695
00:49:57,292 --> 00:50:01,292
Huge blackboards, hour long classes.
He taught me on a piece of paper.

696
00:50:01,709 --> 00:50:02,417
MRI.

697
00:50:02,501 --> 00:50:04,876
Nageshwar.
- Doctor, who is this Nageshwar?

698
00:50:04,959 --> 00:50:06,001
Who knows, doctor.

699
00:50:06,084 --> 00:50:08,251
Since she's been admitted
she's been going on...

700
00:50:08,334 --> 00:50:09,584
...and on about some Nageshwar chap.

701
00:50:10,376 --> 00:50:12,917
I think this is a clear case of
psychological disorder.

702
00:50:13,001 --> 00:50:13,917
Call the psychiatrist.

703
00:50:14,417 --> 00:50:17,667
The first time I saw Nageshwar
I knew there was something about him.

704
00:50:17,751 --> 00:50:20,584
If you have any doubts in your duties,
ask Nageshwar.

705
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:23,876
I don't understand what
you're telling me. Is she alright?

706
00:50:24,084 --> 00:50:26,584
She has just had a case of indigestion.

707
00:50:26,959 --> 00:50:28,501
Meaning? Food poisoning?

708
00:50:28,709 --> 00:50:30,751
Very mild food poisoning.

709
00:50:30,834 --> 00:50:32,084
I was hesitating to tell you because...

710
00:50:32,167 --> 00:50:35,709
...I was scared you'd react
and call our chairman again.

711
00:50:35,792 --> 00:50:37,667
That's why I said indigestion.

712
00:50:38,584 --> 00:50:42,459
Sir, our chairman has been
torturing us for the past hour.

713
00:50:42,751 --> 00:50:47,292
If you could just call him and
tell him that the problem is solved.

714
00:50:47,834 --> 00:50:50,917
Not only that III
get him to promote you.

715
00:50:51,126 --> 00:50:53,001
Thank you sir.
- Head of the department, next. Okay?

716
00:50:53,667 --> 00:50:56,001
Nageshwar.
- Hi.

717
00:50:56,417 --> 00:50:57,751
I ripped apart that exam.

718
00:50:57,834 --> 00:51:01,084
And us too sir. Are you Mr. Nageshwar?

719
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:03,792
This is the first time...

720
00:51:03,876 --> 00:51:05,917
...I've heard someone's name
so many times in one hour.

721
00:51:09,334 --> 00:51:10,751
What is this?
You're prescribing some medicines.

722
00:51:10,834 --> 00:51:14,751
Sir, these are not for her.
These are painkillers. For all of us.

723
00:51:14,834 --> 00:51:17,334
Okay.
- Baburao, for me also.

724
00:51:17,626 --> 00:51:19,042
Starting with you, sir.

725
00:51:23,084 --> 00:51:25,334
Nageshwar, how did you know I'm here?

726
00:51:25,417 --> 00:51:26,792
You told me to call at 12:30.

727
00:51:26,876 --> 00:51:31,376
Oh Divya told you right?
Where is she? Anyway sit down.

728
00:51:31,667 --> 00:51:34,792
I'll tell you how I
aced that marginal utility.

729
00:51:35,042 --> 00:51:35,584
Okay.

730
00:51:35,667 --> 00:51:39,334
Small request. Don't call me Nageshwar.

731
00:51:39,876 --> 00:51:40,792
Call me Bittu.

732
00:51:41,417 --> 00:51:43,792
Bittu? That's so cute.

733
00:51:44,667 --> 00:51:46,584
Let me guess. Your mother
gave you the name didn't she?

734
00:51:46,667 --> 00:51:49,209
You... Yes.. My mother.

735
00:51:49,501 --> 00:51:50,709
Perfect.

736
00:51:51,084 --> 00:51:54,417
It's better you avoid eating outside.
It's not good.

737
00:51:54,792 --> 00:51:58,001
Roadside food doesn't taste good,
no quality, no hygiene...

738
00:51:58,084 --> 00:51:59,084
...if anything happens to you again.

739
00:52:03,459 --> 00:52:08,417
No proper water, no ventilation,
too many mosquitoes, the odor.

740
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:10,876
Excuse me sir.
I've have to give her saline.

741
00:52:10,959 --> 00:52:13,709
Sure. Please do. I'll be right back.

742
00:52:13,792 --> 00:52:14,376
Wait, wait.

743
00:52:14,459 --> 00:52:15,792
I'll be right back. One minute.

744
00:52:18,209 --> 00:52:19,001
Girish Karnad.

745
00:52:19,084 --> 00:52:19,709
Sir.

746
00:52:20,001 --> 00:52:22,209
In Kukatpally there is one
St. Teresa's girls college and hostel.

747
00:52:22,292 --> 00:52:23,167
Do you know it?

748
00:52:23,251 --> 00:52:24,042
I know it sir.

749
00:52:24,376 --> 00:52:28,459
Five times, 10 times. Whatever the rate
is, we need to buy it by this evening.

750
00:52:28,542 --> 00:52:30,626
Okay? - As you wish sir,
your word is an order.

751
00:52:30,709 --> 00:52:33,167
Get the best interior designers...

752
00:52:33,251 --> 00:52:35,959
...and landscape artists on it
and do up the place.

753
00:52:36,292 --> 00:52:37,042
Okay, sir.

754
00:52:37,126 --> 00:52:38,501
One more thing.

755
00:52:38,584 --> 00:52:42,251
Indian, Chinese, Continental,
Japanese, every kind of cuisine.

756
00:52:42,584 --> 00:52:44,959
I want the top chef in Hyderabad.

757
00:52:45,292 --> 00:52:48,792
We have to make that
hostel a star hotel. Right?

758
00:52:50,001 --> 00:52:52,542
Right.. a five star hotel.

759
00:53:02,709 --> 00:53:05,334
Boys, we've had a
historic youth festival.

760
00:53:05,417 --> 00:53:07,417
All the credit goes to Bittu.

761
00:53:07,501 --> 00:53:12,001
Bittu is great.
Well invite Bittu also to our party.

762
00:53:12,251 --> 00:53:14,917
Seenu, lets wrap up for the night.

763
00:53:15,209 --> 00:53:18,584
How can we go home empty handed?
Let’s wait for a while Sir.

764
00:53:18,667 --> 00:53:19,792
What's there to wait for?

765
00:53:20,251 --> 00:53:21,792
Hey, it’s the cops.

766
00:53:21,876 --> 00:53:23,501
Yeah it’s the cops.
Turn the bikes around.

767
00:53:23,584 --> 00:53:27,626
When the liquor shop is that way, why
go the other way you fools. Go ahead.

768
00:53:28,042 --> 00:53:30,709
It’s the end of the month.
If they catch us, they'll fleece us.

769
00:53:30,792 --> 00:53:34,126
You go straight to the inspector.
I'll take care of them.

770
00:53:34,209 --> 00:53:35,667
Have you gone mad?

771
00:53:35,751 --> 00:53:39,417
If we try to avoid them. They
will go out of their way to catch us.

772
00:53:39,501 --> 00:53:43,834
If we go directly to them.
I'll make them let us go. Come on guys.

773
00:53:43,917 --> 00:53:45,751
We can set everything right.
- What an idea, my boy?

774
00:53:45,834 --> 00:53:48,292
Shall I go?
- Come on guys.

775
00:53:49,042 --> 00:53:51,251
Sir, some bikes are coming.

776
00:53:51,751 --> 00:53:56,334
You fool.
They're coming directly towards us.

777
00:53:56,417 --> 00:53:59,917
That means they're clear.
Leave them alone.

778
00:54:01,209 --> 00:54:03,834
Yes you can go. Proceed. Proceed.

779
00:54:04,209 --> 00:54:07,084
Sir, is there any hospital nearby Sir?

780
00:54:07,167 --> 00:54:07,876
What is the matter?

781
00:54:08,167 --> 00:54:10,001
Nothing sir,
just a little dehydrated that's all.

782
00:54:10,292 --> 00:54:13,209
Boys, you've crossed the hospital. KIMS.

783
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:16,834
Really? Why turn back now Sir?
Is there any hospital ahead.

784
00:54:16,917 --> 00:54:19,376
Go about 2km up ahead.
There's a nursing home there.

785
00:54:19,459 --> 00:54:23,001
Oh thank you sir, thank you sir.
You go. Start the bike.

786
00:54:35,792 --> 00:54:38,917
Start it fast. Kick hard.

787
00:54:39,167 --> 00:54:44,834
Check if we are on the neutral.
- I think the fuel is low.

788
00:54:45,834 --> 00:54:46,917
Wait a minute, dude! I am trying.

789
00:54:47,001 --> 00:54:50,751
We just filled petrol.
So try and kick properly.

790
00:54:50,834 --> 00:54:52,084
What are you looking at me for officer,
can you kick start the bike please?

791
00:54:52,167 --> 00:54:56,584
Boys bike trouble? Get off the bike.
Hey, take custody of the bike.

792
00:54:56,667 --> 00:54:58,292
No problem sir, we can manage.

793
00:54:58,376 --> 00:55:03,209
How much will you manage you idiots?
Trying to make a fool of the police?

794
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:06,042
Give me that bottle.
- Sir just mineral water sir.

795
00:55:06,126 --> 00:55:07,126
Give it here.

796
00:55:08,376 --> 00:55:09,084
Water.

797
00:55:11,251 --> 00:55:13,251
This is water?
- I swear on you sir.

798
00:55:13,334 --> 00:55:17,042
Mixing vodka in mineral water
bottles and calling it water?

799
00:55:17,126 --> 00:55:17,834
He found out.

800
00:55:19,001 --> 00:55:20,042
How much did you drink?

801
00:55:20,376 --> 00:55:22,292
One peg sir.
- Just one for formalities sake.

802
00:55:22,376 --> 00:55:25,209
You just had a peg for formality sake?
- Yeah right.

803
00:55:26,376 --> 00:55:27,584
Oh God!

804
00:55:28,792 --> 00:55:31,876
This breathalyzer doesn't
work even if I put the mouth...

805
00:55:31,959 --> 00:55:36,501
...and now it's screeching like
a fire engine from a kilometer away.

806
00:55:37,126 --> 00:55:38,709
Thanks to your idea.
- Get down.

807
00:55:38,792 --> 00:55:39,959
Sir, sir, sir please.
- Get down.

808
00:55:40,042 --> 00:55:41,792
Get down, you useless idiots.
- Sir, sir, sir please. Sorry.

809
00:55:41,876 --> 00:55:42,667
Sir, please excuse us.

810
00:55:45,417 --> 00:55:47,834
There are only two types
of drunken driving cases.

811
00:55:48,626 --> 00:55:50,376
If you are lucky fellows.

812
00:55:52,334 --> 00:55:59,042
Then you ram into a road divider
Or a lorry and die on the spot...

813
00:55:59,126 --> 00:56:01,001
...even before you
can yell for your parents.

814
00:56:01,084 --> 00:56:06,042
If I, Dharma, catch you..
it means you are unlucky fellows.

815
00:56:06,084 --> 00:56:09,292
It means you are doomed!! Dharma.

816
00:56:09,376 --> 00:56:12,792
I am even more dangerous than a road
divider and a lorry together. Dharma!

817
00:56:12,876 --> 00:56:14,251
Much more dangerous.

818
00:56:17,251 --> 00:56:21,376
Are you finding it difficult
to tolerate my gleeking?

819
00:56:23,126 --> 00:56:27,042
You are in the hands of Dharma now.
I will book false cases on you.

820
00:56:27,126 --> 00:56:29,834
I will strip you.

821
00:56:29,917 --> 00:56:31,417
Sir.. sir.
- Sir.. sir.

822
00:56:31,709 --> 00:56:33,084
Sir, please.
Sir can I make just one phone call?

823
00:56:33,292 --> 00:56:36,084
Who are you going to call?
Trying to scare Dharma?

824
00:56:36,167 --> 00:56:37,834
Sir, to my friend sir.
Bittu, sir.

825
00:56:37,917 --> 00:56:41,626
Bittu? What is this Bittu?

826
00:56:41,834 --> 00:56:43,126
Sir, please. Sir. Please.

827
00:56:43,209 --> 00:56:44,959
Alright make the call.
Where is your phone?

828
00:56:45,042 --> 00:56:45,792
In my trouser pocket, Sir.

829
00:56:45,876 --> 00:56:47,167
In your trousers?

830
00:56:47,251 --> 00:56:48,751
Even if you have to take it
from your underwear, make the call.

831
00:56:53,876 --> 00:56:55,751
Sorry, sorry. Ladies first. Please.

832
00:57:05,084 --> 00:57:05,876
DAD?

833
00:57:07,334 --> 00:57:08,334
Hello, Bittu.

834
00:57:08,417 --> 00:57:09,126
What happened? You're calling so late.

835
00:57:09,209 --> 00:57:10,501
I'm at police station Bittu.

836
00:57:10,667 --> 00:57:11,876
Police station?
- Yes.

837
00:57:11,959 --> 00:57:13,792
Which one?
- Here, in Punjagutta.

838
00:57:13,959 --> 00:57:15,126
I'm coming right over, wait.

839
00:57:15,209 --> 00:57:18,459
No Bittu. Bittu it's okay,
take your time. Slowly.

840
00:57:20,209 --> 00:57:22,376
Bittu, Bittu, come fast Bittu.
Come fast.

841
00:57:34,584 --> 00:57:37,667
When he asked for a treadmill,
I thought he was going to work out.

842
00:57:37,751 --> 00:57:39,251
He is using it to practice
for his political walk.

843
00:57:41,751 --> 00:57:44,709
Oh yes. Stop it, stop it.

844
00:57:46,251 --> 00:57:49,251
Unknown number, unknown number.
Stop it, stop it.

845
00:57:50,751 --> 00:57:55,167
Hello Madam, low command.
Good evening.

846
00:57:55,542 --> 00:57:57,751
I've been waiting for your call.

847
00:57:58,209 --> 00:58:00,667
JP. JP, this is Nageshwar Rao speaking.

848
00:58:01,626 --> 00:58:04,084
Oh brother, it’s you.
How come you're calling now?

849
00:58:04,167 --> 00:58:05,751
Listen carefully to
what I'm going to tell you.

850
00:58:05,834 --> 00:58:07,959
Some fool has brought
a person named Nagarjuna...

851
00:58:08,001 --> 00:58:10,001
...to the Punjagutta police
station and is keeping him there.

852
00:58:10,084 --> 00:58:13,959
If anything happens to him, then by
sunrise, you and your government will.

853
00:58:14,042 --> 00:58:17,417
No need for such extremes, brother.
Leave it to me, I'll take care.

854
00:58:19,334 --> 00:58:20,292
Hello.

855
00:58:21,126 --> 00:58:21,959
Okay.

856
00:58:22,042 --> 00:58:23,084
Okay, sir.

857
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:25,709
Sir.
- Yes?

858
00:58:25,959 --> 00:58:28,292
Call from home Sir. It’s your wife.

859
00:58:28,376 --> 00:58:32,459
I have a cell phone. Cant she call me on
that number She calls on the landline.

860
00:58:32,667 --> 00:58:34,334
To check if I'm in the station or not.

861
00:58:34,709 --> 00:58:38,542
Just like cops don't trust thieves,
their wives don't trust them.

862
00:58:38,626 --> 00:58:41,417
I don't trust you boys.
You might drink this.

863
00:58:44,626 --> 00:58:50,792
What is it Home? I'm at the station
only. I'm not with my girl friend.

864
00:58:51,001 --> 00:58:55,542
This isn't your wife.
It's me Minister on line.

865
00:58:56,167 --> 00:58:58,834
Oh my God. Sir, sir, greetings sir.

866
00:58:58,917 --> 00:59:00,834
Do you know who the boys
you have taken into custody are?

867
00:59:00,917 --> 00:59:01,792
Sir, I don't sir.

868
00:59:01,876 --> 00:59:03,126
Do you know who Nageshwara Rao is?

869
00:59:03,209 --> 00:59:04,084
Sir, I don't sir.

870
00:59:04,167 --> 00:59:05,376
Do you know who Nagarjuna is?

871
00:59:05,459 --> 00:59:06,334
Sir, I don't sir.

872
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:09,292
I stay out of their dealings.

873
00:59:09,376 --> 00:59:10,584
Sir, there's been a mistake sir.

874
00:59:10,667 --> 00:59:11,792
What do you think will happen to you.

875
00:59:11,876 --> 00:59:13,167
Sir, it is a misunderstanding sir.

876
00:59:13,251 --> 00:59:17,209
Let them go immediately.
Otherwise you'll go to hell.

877
00:59:17,251 --> 00:59:18,376
Sure sir!

878
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:22,167
Sreenu.
- Sir.

879
00:59:22,584 --> 00:59:23,084
Come here.

880
00:59:23,709 --> 00:59:24,251
Tell me, Sir.

881
00:59:24,542 --> 00:59:28,209
You rascal.
I call my wife home minister.

882
00:59:28,292 --> 00:59:30,709
Do I call the Home
Minister my Wife? Idiot.

883
00:59:32,917 --> 00:59:37,709
Excuse me gentlemen, who is Mr.
Nagarjuna amongst you?

884
00:59:40,459 --> 00:59:43,126
Sir. Sreenu.
- Sir.

885
00:59:43,209 --> 00:59:44,584
Come here, come here.

886
00:59:44,667 --> 00:59:48,751
How dare you make this gentleman sit
without warm clothing out in the cold?

887
00:59:48,834 --> 00:59:51,334
Idiot. Go bring his clothes. Fast.

888
00:59:53,334 --> 00:59:56,876
Please wear this, dude.
- This is enough. That Dharma...

889
00:59:56,959 --> 00:59:58,209
Everything alright?

890
00:59:58,292 --> 01:00:03,209
Bittu, Bittu, Bittu, Bittu.
Thank you so much for coming Bittu.

891
01:00:03,376 --> 01:00:05,834
I didn't know who to call at this time.

892
01:00:05,917 --> 01:00:07,709
So I called you. Sorry to trouble you.
- Don't worry about it.

893
01:00:07,792 --> 01:00:12,084
You must call only me. Nobody else.
Who brought these boys here?

894
01:00:12,792 --> 01:00:13,792
Sir.

895
01:00:16,251 --> 01:00:18,376
I am that unfortunate
unlucky person, Sir.

896
01:00:18,459 --> 01:00:20,042
But I didn't arrest him.

897
01:00:20,334 --> 01:00:22,084
This is a complete
misunderstanding, Sir.

898
01:00:22,167 --> 01:00:23,792
I didn't give him any trouble.
Sir, please ask him.

899
01:00:23,876 --> 01:00:25,209
There was no problem right?

900
01:00:25,292 --> 01:00:26,084
No Bittu.

901
01:00:26,167 --> 01:00:27,292
Dharma took care of us very well.
- See Sir I took good care of him.

902
01:00:27,376 --> 01:00:28,501
No problem.
- If he troubles you...

903
01:00:28,792 --> 01:00:29,792
I actually like this young man, Sir.

904
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:31,292
You're okay right? Let’s go.
- Okay Bittu.

905
01:00:31,376 --> 01:00:33,209
One minute let me finish this.

906
01:00:34,709 --> 01:00:36,626
Dharma what about my bike?

907
01:00:36,834 --> 01:00:41,376
Sir that bike has to be cleaned tires
checked and the tank filled with fuel...

908
01:00:41,459 --> 01:00:43,917
...I will send it to your place.
- Come lets go from here.

909
01:00:44,292 --> 01:00:45,209
Don't worry, sir.
- Hey come!

910
01:00:45,292 --> 01:00:47,417
All of you please come too.
- I love you dear.

911
01:00:47,626 --> 01:00:48,751
Mr. Dharma take this.
- Thank you my Lord.

912
01:00:51,167 --> 01:00:54,251
Why are you doing this riding
the bike after drinking isn't safe.

913
01:00:55,501 --> 01:00:56,667
What if something happens to you?

914
01:00:57,417 --> 01:00:59,334
If you want to drink please
come to my house and drink there.

915
01:00:59,667 --> 01:01:02,459
You can do whatever you want.

916
01:01:02,876 --> 01:01:05,209
I will drop you at
college in the morning.

917
01:01:05,292 --> 01:01:08,834
From now on please don't
take such risks again. Okay.

918
01:01:09,042 --> 01:01:10,292
Amazing Bittu.

919
01:01:10,376 --> 01:01:13,584
You are not nagging me
about drinking too much...

920
01:01:13,667 --> 01:01:17,501
...and instead you are inviting me
home to drink. I just love that Bittu.

921
01:01:17,584 --> 01:01:20,126
Boys from tomorrow the
party is at Bittu's house.

922
01:01:20,209 --> 01:01:20,876
Yes sure.

923
01:01:21,084 --> 01:01:25,501
Bittu sorry.
Till now I misunderstood you.

924
01:01:26,459 --> 01:01:30,876
From today you're my best friend.
Give me five Bittu, give me five please.

925
01:02:09,501 --> 01:02:15,667
"I've become the mother
to my mom who gave birth to me."

926
01:02:16,042 --> 01:02:22,209
"I've become the father to my dad who
taught me how to take my first steps."

927
01:02:22,959 --> 01:02:24,459
"One is my sight."

928
01:02:24,542 --> 01:02:26,126
"The other my eyes."

929
01:02:26,209 --> 01:02:29,376
"Both together make my life beautiful."

930
01:02:29,417 --> 01:02:30,959
"One is the feeling."

931
01:02:31,042 --> 01:02:32,626
"The other is the thought."

932
01:02:32,709 --> 01:02:35,417
"Both together, make my world turn."

933
01:02:35,501 --> 01:02:36,626
"They fill my life with love."

934
01:02:36,709 --> 01:02:37,626
"Love."

935
01:02:38,667 --> 01:02:41,876
"Love is back."

936
01:02:41,959 --> 01:02:44,834
"This is love."

937
01:02:45,209 --> 01:02:48,376
"I only see love."

938
01:02:48,459 --> 01:02:55,334
"These moments filled
with love are drowning me."

939
01:03:33,084 --> 01:03:39,167
"I'm becoming the teacher to
the mother who taught me to write."

940
01:03:39,251 --> 01:03:44,501
"I'm becoming the path to
the father who taught me my steps."

941
01:03:45,584 --> 01:03:48,417
"As I watch them be playful."

942
01:03:48,501 --> 01:03:51,876
"Joy is back. Watching them grow."

943
01:03:52,126 --> 01:03:54,959
"Becoming the child again with them."

944
01:03:55,042 --> 01:03:58,542
"The story in my dreams is coming true."

945
01:03:58,626 --> 01:04:01,376
"This is love."

946
01:04:01,459 --> 01:04:04,584
"I only see love."

947
01:04:04,667 --> 01:04:07,751
"This is love."

948
01:04:07,834 --> 01:04:11,042
"They fill my life with love."

949
01:04:11,126 --> 01:04:17,209
"These moments filled
with love are drowning me."

950
01:04:31,001 --> 01:04:36,417
"The hand feeding me
is the hand of an angel."

951
01:04:37,501 --> 01:04:43,292
"That angel wiping my tears away
is the one who needs to be worshipped."

952
01:04:43,917 --> 01:04:50,042
"How can I forget the many
bedtime stories read to me."

953
01:04:50,501 --> 01:04:53,292
"The sways in my cradle."

954
01:04:53,376 --> 01:04:56,501
"Have today become
the beats of my heart."

955
01:04:56,584 --> 01:04:59,751
"This is love."

956
01:04:59,834 --> 01:05:02,959
"I only see love."

957
01:05:03,042 --> 01:05:06,084
"This is love."

958
01:05:06,251 --> 01:05:09,459
"They fill my life with love."

959
01:05:09,542 --> 01:05:15,626
"These moments filled
with love are drowning me."

960
01:05:35,584 --> 01:05:36,459
Buddy.

961
01:05:37,126 --> 01:05:38,417
I can’t believe it.

962
01:05:38,626 --> 01:05:39,876
I'm so happy today.

963
01:05:40,292 --> 01:05:41,917
The conversations I've
missed having with Mom.

964
01:05:42,584 --> 01:05:44,084
The laughter I've missed with my Dad.

965
01:05:44,167 --> 01:05:47,751
All this and more, I've experienced
in just a few days with them.

966
01:05:47,959 --> 01:05:50,084
There is only one thing left.
just one more thing.

967
01:05:51,126 --> 01:05:52,209
That is to get them together.

968
01:05:53,126 --> 01:05:55,376
Where are you running off to?

969
01:05:58,209 --> 01:06:01,751
Hey Buddy.
What did you get? Oh I understand.

970
01:06:02,584 --> 01:06:04,834
So I should show them this video.

971
01:06:04,917 --> 01:06:09,917
And tell them that they were
married in a different lifetime.

972
01:06:10,001 --> 01:06:11,501
And that I am their son.

973
01:06:13,751 --> 01:06:14,667
No Buddy.

974
01:06:15,001 --> 01:06:17,042
What’s in this video
are all bad memories.

975
01:06:18,292 --> 01:06:20,626
They both were constantly fighting.

976
01:06:21,584 --> 01:06:23,626
I don't want to remind
them of those things.

977
01:06:25,376 --> 01:06:27,209
They don't need to know I'm their son.

978
01:06:27,292 --> 01:06:29,001
But they should never
remember those fights.

979
01:06:30,459 --> 01:06:37,251
They must meet again. Fall in
love again. And live happily ever after.

980
01:06:39,417 --> 01:06:40,834
Dad.

981
01:06:41,251 --> 01:06:44,001
What happened?
Why are you bleeding? What happened?

982
01:06:59,834 --> 01:07:03,792
Bittu. she is Prema.
We both are in love.

983
01:07:03,959 --> 01:07:06,126
Her family found out, and doesn't
approve. They made a big issue.

984
01:07:06,292 --> 01:07:07,959
And we had to elope.

985
01:07:08,042 --> 01:07:12,792
You have to take us to a temple
tomorrow and get us married. Please.

986
01:07:15,042 --> 01:07:17,376
You trust me, right.

987
01:07:17,459 --> 01:07:18,417
Of course I do Bittu.

988
01:07:18,876 --> 01:07:19,959
Then listen to me.

989
01:07:20,251 --> 01:07:24,709
Why should you elope and marry secretly?

990
01:07:24,792 --> 01:07:26,959
I will talk to her father
and set things right for you.

991
01:07:27,209 --> 01:07:28,459
Can things be set right.

992
01:07:28,542 --> 01:07:30,709
It is for setting things
right that I am here.

993
01:07:30,792 --> 01:07:32,792
That's why I need
her father’s phone number.

994
01:07:32,876 --> 01:07:34,167
Prema, what's your fathers number?

995
01:07:39,751 --> 01:07:41,501
It'll get stained.

996
01:07:41,834 --> 01:07:42,417
That's alright.

997
01:07:42,459 --> 01:07:43,417
I'll do it.

998
01:07:44,751 --> 01:07:46,376
What is your fathers phone number?

999
01:07:46,459 --> 01:07:50,251
Oh yeah.
984909828.

1000
01:07:50,501 --> 01:07:53,084
What is your father’s name?

1001
01:07:56,126 --> 01:07:56,667
Sir.

1002
01:07:56,751 --> 01:07:58,251
His name is Yashwanth Rayudu.

1003
01:07:58,334 --> 01:08:01,251
I'll send you his number.
I want all his details.

1004
01:08:01,667 --> 01:08:02,376
Yes sir.

1005
01:08:02,459 --> 01:08:04,584
I want 10 thugs.

1006
01:08:04,667 --> 01:08:05,251
Thugs?

1007
01:08:05,334 --> 01:08:07,209
And not ordinary ones.

1008
01:08:07,292 --> 01:08:12,959
They need to have huge moustaches
thick beards, mole on the face...

1009
01:08:13,042 --> 01:08:15,126
...and weapons in their hands.

1010
01:08:15,917 --> 01:08:21,417
Everyone should get
scared when they see them.

1011
01:08:21,667 --> 01:08:22,792
Leave it to me sir.

1012
01:08:23,209 --> 01:08:24,667
I'll take care.

1013
01:08:24,751 --> 01:08:28,959
I'll find ones that tremble
when they see themselves in the mirror.

1014
01:08:29,167 --> 01:08:29,959
Don't worry.

1015
01:08:30,042 --> 01:08:32,251
Okay, I'll tell you the details later.

1016
01:08:39,292 --> 01:08:41,876
That's where my Mom should be.

1017
01:08:44,834 --> 01:08:47,667
You are so pretty.
- You know get up, get up move.

1018
01:08:50,959 --> 01:08:53,459
I've taken care of everything.
- Okay.

1019
01:08:53,542 --> 01:08:55,709
Kokila...

1020
01:08:55,792 --> 01:08:57,542
Yes Prema. You can go now.

1021
01:08:57,626 --> 01:09:00,126
Tomorrow he will come and talk to your
father and everything will be alright.

1022
01:09:00,209 --> 01:09:01,876
Bittu. I have to go.

1023
01:09:01,959 --> 01:09:04,751
I have taken care of everything.
Don't worry at all.

1024
01:09:04,834 --> 01:09:09,126
Just go meet him and tell him what is
in your heart. Everything will be fine.

1025
01:09:09,376 --> 01:09:12,917
Uncle. Bittu told
you the absolute truth.

1026
01:09:13,376 --> 01:09:14,667
Please trust me uncle.

1027
01:09:14,876 --> 01:09:17,876
Understand my love.
And give Prema to me.

1028
01:09:18,376 --> 01:09:24,376
I will love Prema even more
than you love Prema and look after her.

1029
01:09:34,667 --> 01:09:35,584
You can do this.

1030
01:09:35,792 --> 01:09:37,709
Uncle. Yes. Coming.

1031
01:09:55,501 --> 01:09:57,376
Looks like he's planned to kill me.

1032
01:10:06,209 --> 01:10:08,251
Why is the old man getting scared of me?

1033
01:10:10,626 --> 01:10:12,376
Let’s get him.

1034
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:15,167
Hey.. hey.

1035
01:10:15,251 --> 01:10:17,251
Please, please.
- Hello, brothers.

1036
01:10:17,501 --> 01:10:18,751
Hello, please.

1037
01:10:18,834 --> 01:10:21,292
If you don't give your
daughter to our Brother.

1038
01:10:22,209 --> 01:10:22,626
Brother.

1039
01:10:22,667 --> 01:10:23,834
Don't do anything to me please.

1040
01:10:24,917 --> 01:10:25,667
Here you go.

1041
01:10:27,376 --> 01:10:29,417
When I saw everything
that happened there...

1042
01:10:29,501 --> 01:10:32,334
...I actually suspected that
I myself organized the entire thing.

1043
01:10:32,417 --> 01:10:36,584
You shouldn't think so.
Why will you do such a thing?

1044
01:10:36,751 --> 01:10:40,542
Then where did they come from Bittu.
Them and their weapons.

1045
01:10:40,626 --> 01:10:42,084
Leave all that for now.

1046
01:10:42,167 --> 01:10:44,584
What we need is Prema. Shall
I plan your wedding in some temple.

1047
01:10:44,667 --> 01:10:45,917
She will never come now.

1048
01:10:46,001 --> 01:10:46,792
Why?

1049
01:10:47,084 --> 01:10:50,792
She believes her father’s version
of the story. She doesn't trust me.

1050
01:10:50,876 --> 01:10:52,459
She thinks I arranged the entire thing.

1051
01:10:53,126 --> 01:10:54,334
Shall I go and convince her.

1052
01:10:54,417 --> 01:10:56,667
No need Bittu I hate her Bittu.

1053
01:10:56,751 --> 01:11:00,084
Not just her I hate all the women in
the world. I don't want a woman at all.

1054
01:11:00,376 --> 01:11:02,084
Just because she turned out this way...

1055
01:11:02,167 --> 01:11:04,334
...why are you saying that
you hate all women in the world.

1056
01:11:04,417 --> 01:11:05,834
There are good girls out there.

1057
01:11:06,376 --> 01:11:09,667
Bittu. You're a very clever guy.

1058
01:11:09,751 --> 01:11:13,459
You've understood the nature
of women and stayed single.

1059
01:11:14,084 --> 01:11:18,126
I will follow you from now on.
Don't marry, be happy.

1060
01:11:18,209 --> 01:11:21,876
There is a soul mate
out there for all of us.

1061
01:11:21,959 --> 01:11:24,876
Even for you, there is one.
She will come into your life soon.

1062
01:11:25,167 --> 01:11:27,876
No Bittu. I won’t look at women again.

1063
01:11:27,959 --> 01:11:29,126
I will avoid them like the plague.

1064
01:11:29,209 --> 01:11:31,667
I won’t talk to them.
I don't trust them anymore.

1065
01:11:31,751 --> 01:11:32,876
Oh God!

1066
01:11:33,126 --> 01:11:37,501
I am planning to get Mom into Dads
life and he wants to stay a bachelor.

1067
01:11:37,834 --> 01:11:40,709
I need a good plan to get them together.

1068
01:11:51,084 --> 01:11:52,834
Come on. I am already late.

1069
01:12:33,126 --> 01:12:35,917
Move. Follow that car.

1070
01:12:38,251 --> 01:12:40,709
It's.. emergency.

1071
01:12:41,084 --> 01:12:43,792
There's a patient in that car,
please follow it.

1072
01:12:44,042 --> 01:12:46,001
I'm a doctor.

1073
01:12:46,209 --> 01:12:48,334
There's a patient inside that car.

1074
01:12:48,792 --> 01:12:51,501
Please drop me at the hospital.

1075
01:12:53,834 --> 01:12:54,792
Fast.

1076
01:12:55,626 --> 01:12:57,584
Follow that car.

1077
01:13:19,751 --> 01:13:20,501
Come on.

1078
01:13:33,834 --> 01:13:34,542
Come.

1079
01:13:41,792 --> 01:13:42,542
Come.

1080
01:13:47,251 --> 01:13:48,209
Help us take him out of the car.

1081
01:13:52,459 --> 01:13:55,501
Please help me.

1082
01:13:55,792 --> 01:13:57,042
Help him.

1083
01:14:02,292 --> 01:14:03,209
Careful.

1084
01:14:11,167 --> 01:14:14,334
Take him into emergency
and call the blood bank, okay.

1085
01:14:18,084 --> 01:14:19,417
What is your blood group?

1086
01:14:19,917 --> 01:14:20,876
'O' positive.

1087
01:14:33,126 --> 01:14:34,042
Does it hurt?

1088
01:14:34,126 --> 01:14:35,292
No, not at all.

1089
01:14:35,376 --> 01:14:37,501
The patient needs blood urgently.

1090
01:14:37,709 --> 01:14:40,751
Your blood group is 'O'
positive universal donor.

1091
01:14:40,834 --> 01:14:41,876
You can donate to anyone.

1092
01:14:42,126 --> 01:14:43,542
Please take my blood.

1093
01:14:43,751 --> 01:14:46,542
Don't worry. Taking 350 ml
is not going to affect you at all.

1094
01:14:46,834 --> 01:14:49,001
No problem, no problem.
Take as much as you want.

1095
01:14:49,084 --> 01:14:52,667
You are saving a life.

1096
01:16:03,292 --> 01:16:05,292
Mom! Dad!

1097
01:16:35,501 --> 01:16:38,084
Uncle, you're up?

1098
01:16:38,334 --> 01:16:39,959
I'm Dr. Anjali

1099
01:16:40,292 --> 01:16:41,542
Would you like some water?

1100
01:16:41,751 --> 01:16:43,209
How are you feeling now?

1101
01:16:43,584 --> 01:16:45,001
Did you sleep well?

1102
01:16:46,126 --> 01:16:50,501
Take a deep breath.

1103
01:16:54,001 --> 01:16:54,792
Do you have any pain?

1104
01:16:55,001 --> 01:16:56,126
You're feeling better right?

1105
01:16:56,501 --> 01:16:57,001
Good.

1106
01:16:57,084 --> 01:17:01,084
Uncle, do you know
how I found you today?

1107
01:17:02,709 --> 01:17:06,126
It was as if you called
out to me for help.

1108
01:17:07,042 --> 01:17:08,917
I was buying something
by the road, Uncle.

1109
01:17:10,042 --> 01:17:12,126
Suddenly,
I felt like someone called out to me.

1110
01:17:13,209 --> 01:17:17,709
I came running there to find you
injured, calling out for your mother.

1111
01:17:17,876 --> 01:17:18,501
Mother.

1112
01:17:19,876 --> 01:17:20,417
Mother.

1113
01:17:21,584 --> 01:17:22,167
Mother.

1114
01:17:24,876 --> 01:17:26,542
That was when he came there, Uncle.

1115
01:17:26,709 --> 01:17:28,626
It was as if he came
there just to help you.

1116
01:17:29,251 --> 01:17:31,001
As though he was there
just to bring us to the hospital.

1117
01:17:31,417 --> 01:17:33,209
He even gave blood for your Uncle.

1118
01:17:34,376 --> 01:17:42,001
I feel as if everything magically
came together for you, Uncle.

1119
01:17:42,667 --> 01:17:49,084
In all that confusion,
I forgot to ask him his name.

1120
01:17:54,959 --> 01:17:56,417
Food for you, Uncle.

1121
01:17:58,792 --> 01:18:01,709
Don't get up, I will feed you.

1122
01:18:03,001 --> 01:18:04,042
Open your mouth.

1123
01:18:05,667 --> 01:18:10,542
I don't know if I am unlucky
to have lost you at the age of 8...

1124
01:18:10,709 --> 01:18:16,626
...or whether I am lucky to
have met you again at the age of 80.

1125
01:18:16,709 --> 01:18:19,876
They say that when parents give life,
children are born.

1126
01:18:19,959 --> 01:18:24,334
To give me life again today,
if my parents are reborn...

1127
01:18:24,376 --> 01:18:26,584
...then I am the luckiest
person in the world.

1128
01:18:26,751 --> 01:18:29,667
I have heard this story a
thousand times from my grandmother...

1129
01:18:29,751 --> 01:18:32,376
...as she put me to bed.

1130
01:18:32,417 --> 01:18:35,126
My parents love story.

1131
01:18:36,501 --> 01:18:38,542
My grandfathers name is Bangaru Naidu.

1132
01:18:38,626 --> 01:18:40,626
In those days,
he was a very wealthy man.

1133
01:18:41,167 --> 01:18:44,084
All the rice mills in
our town belonged to him.

1134
01:18:44,792 --> 01:18:48,251
My father was the only
heir to my grandparents.

1135
01:18:48,959 --> 01:18:50,251
His name was Sitaram.

1136
01:18:51,084 --> 01:18:53,542
My grandfather,
being a man of Gandhian principles...

1137
01:18:53,626 --> 01:18:56,501
...wanted my father to become a lawyer.

1138
01:18:57,334 --> 01:19:01,417
My father was one of the few fortunate
Indians to be educated in London.

1139
01:19:01,626 --> 01:19:06,167
When in London,
my father developed a craze for cars.

1140
01:19:06,251 --> 01:19:08,917
When my grandfather
unexpectedly passed away...

1141
01:19:08,959 --> 01:19:11,459
...father had to
discontinue his studies...

1142
01:19:11,501 --> 01:19:15,334
...and come back home
to take care of his business.

1143
01:19:15,417 --> 01:19:18,876
Father left London behind,
but not his craze for cars.

1144
01:19:18,959 --> 01:19:20,834
This is the model which
the Maharaja of Mysore has.

1145
01:19:20,917 --> 01:19:23,042
If you approve, I can have it
at your doorstep by tomorrow evening.

1146
01:19:23,126 --> 01:19:27,001
Can you marry these cars
or have children with them?

1147
01:19:27,084 --> 01:19:29,417
I've told you a thousand times, Mom.

1148
01:19:29,501 --> 01:19:32,084
I don't want to get married.
Show me the picture.

1149
01:19:32,376 --> 01:19:34,376
Did you hear what he said, Sharma?

1150
01:19:34,459 --> 01:19:38,126
Let me take care of it. I will make
him fall in love today. Have a look.

1151
01:19:38,209 --> 01:19:40,251
Is that your plan?
I will show him some pictures too.

1152
01:19:40,334 --> 01:19:42,001
Sir, how is this model.

1153
01:19:42,084 --> 01:19:43,917
Look, look at this girl.

1154
01:19:44,001 --> 01:19:45,209
She is beautiful.
- Mother, please, no.

1155
01:19:46,126 --> 01:19:46,876
Sir, look at this car.

1156
01:19:46,917 --> 01:19:47,709
Give me another photo.

1157
01:19:48,542 --> 01:19:49,459
Please take a look at this.
- This car...

1158
01:19:49,542 --> 01:19:51,292
Have a look at this girl.

1159
01:19:51,376 --> 01:19:53,001
Pretty, isn't she?
- Mother, no.

1160
01:19:56,001 --> 01:19:57,959
This car is very good.

1161
01:20:06,209 --> 01:20:07,792
Mother, look at this girl.

1162
01:20:10,209 --> 01:20:11,751
Pretty, isn't she?

1163
01:20:12,001 --> 01:20:13,126
Who is this girl?

1164
01:20:14,376 --> 01:20:17,501
There's been a small mistake.

1165
01:20:17,709 --> 01:20:21,501
This proposal will not match
your standards. They are very poor.

1166
01:20:21,584 --> 01:20:23,876
Apart from her grandmother...

1167
01:20:23,959 --> 01:20:26,042
...this girl has nobody,
nor does she come from wealth.

1168
01:20:26,126 --> 01:20:28,501
Mother, what do we need?

1169
01:20:28,542 --> 01:20:31,501
We need a wonderful girl to come
into our home. And that is this girl.

1170
01:20:34,084 --> 01:20:35,917
But her family...

1171
01:20:36,167 --> 01:20:40,251
After marriage, her family will be mine.

1172
01:20:40,709 --> 01:20:43,501
She will be my mother’s daughter-in-law.

1173
01:20:43,584 --> 01:20:46,751
You talk of her wealth.
Our wealth is hers.

1174
01:20:47,084 --> 01:20:51,501
Do you realize what her status
will be once she marries me, Sharma?

1175
01:20:52,959 --> 01:20:54,542
What are you waiting for?

1176
01:20:54,626 --> 01:20:56,459
My Sitaram likes this girl.

1177
01:20:56,542 --> 01:21:01,459
Before someone else looks at her,
go and fix the match as soon as you can.

1178
01:21:01,709 --> 01:21:02,626
I will do it at once.

1179
01:21:02,792 --> 01:21:04,001
Sharma, give me that photo please.

1180
01:21:04,084 --> 01:21:05,001
Here.

1181
01:21:06,876 --> 01:21:08,251
I want this car.

1182
01:21:08,501 --> 01:21:09,459
Sure, Sir.

1183
01:21:14,292 --> 01:21:16,209
I don't understand this, Sharma.

1184
01:21:16,292 --> 01:21:18,209
After rejecting so many girls,
I finally accepted one.

1185
01:21:18,251 --> 01:21:21,001
When we approached the family,
they put some conditions.

1186
01:21:21,209 --> 01:21:22,584
We agreed to all of them.

1187
01:21:22,667 --> 01:21:26,334
Now what is this new demand asking
for 6 months time before the wedding?

1188
01:21:26,417 --> 01:21:27,751
What is the reason?

1189
01:21:27,834 --> 01:21:31,126
I don't think this is a demand, Sir.
It seems more like a request.

1190
01:21:31,501 --> 01:21:34,292
It's only 6 months they are asking.
Time will fly.

1191
01:21:34,542 --> 01:21:35,959
What are you saying, Mother?

1192
01:21:36,251 --> 01:21:39,209
These demands are irrelevant.
I want to marry her.

1193
01:21:42,167 --> 01:21:42,959
The car has arrived.

1194
01:21:46,792 --> 01:21:47,876
Fantastic.

1195
01:21:48,292 --> 01:21:49,834
Here you go. Your cheetah awaits.

1196
01:21:49,917 --> 01:21:50,667
Thank you.

1197
01:21:50,751 --> 01:21:51,501
My pleasure.

1198
01:21:51,792 --> 01:21:55,584
The car is here.
Now we need her to come.

1199
01:21:57,084 --> 01:22:01,792
The issue is I wanted to marry
her after seeing her photograph.

1200
01:22:01,959 --> 01:22:04,084
If she has to feel the same way,
then she needs to see me too, right?

1201
01:22:32,001 --> 01:22:33,126
What happened to this damn thing?

1202
01:22:33,417 --> 01:22:34,376
I will kill that salesman.

1203
01:22:35,501 --> 01:22:37,126
Thank god it stopped here.

1204
01:22:37,167 --> 01:22:39,792
If it stopped in her village,
I would have lost face.

1205
01:22:45,001 --> 01:22:47,626
God alone knows which parts are missing.

1206
01:22:47,792 --> 01:22:48,917
He said it’s a new car

1207
01:22:49,667 --> 01:22:52,751
If any part is required,
I have to get it from London.

1208
01:23:04,334 --> 01:23:04,917
Who is it?

1209
01:23:21,501 --> 01:23:22,292
Hey.

1210
01:23:23,834 --> 01:23:24,876
Come out from there.

1211
01:23:26,459 --> 01:23:29,917
What? Why are you staring at me?

1212
01:23:30,792 --> 01:23:33,709
Come out from under there. Come fast.

1213
01:23:36,126 --> 01:23:38,042
Break this and give it to me. Fast.

1214
01:23:44,501 --> 01:23:45,917
Come.

1215
01:23:46,001 --> 01:23:47,209
Come fast.

1216
01:23:56,251 --> 01:23:56,959
Grandma.

1217
01:23:57,709 --> 01:23:58,417
Grandma.

1218
01:23:59,751 --> 01:24:02,376
Do I have to tell you everything?
Come and hold her down.

1219
01:24:05,959 --> 01:24:06,709
Grandma.

1220
01:24:09,709 --> 01:24:10,417
Grandma.

1221
01:24:19,167 --> 01:24:22,959
Instead of staring at me,
go get her some water.

1222
01:24:23,042 --> 01:24:23,751
Alright

1223
01:24:32,417 --> 01:24:34,959
I told you to stay home.
Why did you come here?

1224
01:24:35,334 --> 01:24:37,084
Why do you need to struggle in the sun?

1225
01:24:37,292 --> 01:24:39,709
I feel you're in a hurry to
go to your son and daughter-in-law.

1226
01:24:40,751 --> 01:24:44,459
They abandoned me and passed away.
Now you want to follow?

1227
01:24:45,376 --> 01:24:47,042
Don't you love me?

1228
01:24:47,959 --> 01:24:49,834
If you go, who do I have left?

1229
01:24:51,042 --> 01:24:52,292
It’s not that.

1230
01:24:52,917 --> 01:24:55,792
You've asked for only 6
months time before the wedding...

1231
01:24:55,876 --> 01:24:58,376
...and you are working so hard.

1232
01:24:58,459 --> 01:25:00,584
I just wanted to help out

1233
01:25:00,667 --> 01:25:05,542
That is when Father found out
why mother had asked for the 6 months.

1234
01:25:06,584 --> 01:25:09,876
As per tradition,
on the day of the wedding...

1235
01:25:09,959 --> 01:25:13,751
...the grooms clothes have
to be given by the bride’s family.

1236
01:25:14,542 --> 01:25:19,334
When he saw the struggle she was going
through just to buy a pair of clothes...

1237
01:25:19,417 --> 01:25:23,209
...he understood the
dire poverty she came from.

1238
01:25:23,751 --> 01:25:28,209
She had to till the little land she had,
harvest the crop and sell it.

1239
01:25:28,292 --> 01:25:32,917
And then she would earn
the money to buy the clothes.

1240
01:25:33,084 --> 01:25:39,584
Realizing the efforts taken by mom
to buy him clothes impressed my dad.

1241
01:25:40,626 --> 01:25:43,084
Until then, Father only liked my mother.

1242
01:25:43,709 --> 01:25:48,751
At that moment,
he fell in love with her.

1243
01:25:51,001 --> 01:25:53,292
What are you standing there
like a statue? Give me that water.

1244
01:25:58,084 --> 01:25:58,667
Drink.

1245
01:26:04,126 --> 01:26:05,167
Who is this?

1246
01:26:05,459 --> 01:26:07,001
He doesn't look like
he's from our village.

1247
01:26:07,167 --> 01:26:08,751
Can’t you see?

1248
01:26:09,626 --> 01:26:10,667
He is a thief.

1249
01:26:11,417 --> 01:26:17,417
Someone's motor car stopped on the road.
He was stealing parts from it.

1250
01:26:19,292 --> 01:26:24,626
That is wrong, Son. You seem healthy.
Why don't you work for a living?

1251
01:26:25,334 --> 01:26:27,584
That's what I came here for.
- What?

1252
01:26:27,667 --> 01:26:29,251
To work for a living.

1253
01:26:51,667 --> 01:26:54,209
Will you give me some water?

1254
01:26:54,376 --> 01:26:55,667
No I won’t. Go away.

1255
01:26:56,917 --> 01:27:00,584
I helped you bring
your Grandmother home.

1256
01:27:01,001 --> 01:27:02,209
Can’t you at least give me some water?

1257
01:27:02,292 --> 01:27:06,626
When we were bringing grandma home,
your were staring at me.

1258
01:27:06,709 --> 01:27:08,167
You think I didn't notice?

1259
01:27:08,459 --> 01:27:11,084
When did I look at you?
Why would I look at you?

1260
01:27:13,126 --> 01:27:16,084
Just because I can’t speak
properly don't think I'm a fool.

1261
01:27:16,167 --> 01:27:20,626
If had met someone who
talks back like you 4 days ago.

1262
01:27:20,709 --> 01:27:22,334
What happened 4 days ago?

1263
01:27:25,167 --> 01:27:26,209
Do you want to know what happened?

1264
01:27:31,126 --> 01:27:33,042
My marriage was fixed.

1265
01:27:34,251 --> 01:27:40,292
Do you know who I'm getting married to?
He is a Zamindar. Such a good man.

1266
01:27:40,709 --> 01:27:44,501
Even though I'm poor, he is marrying me.

1267
01:27:44,751 --> 01:27:48,709
Even though he knows that I stammer,
he wants to marry me.

1268
01:27:49,417 --> 01:27:53,501
He even agreed to my Grandmother
living with us after the wedding.

1269
01:27:55,001 --> 01:27:57,792
If he finds out that
you've been eyeing me.

1270
01:27:59,501 --> 01:28:00,376
He will kill you.

1271
01:28:00,959 --> 01:28:04,501
I don't know what he saw
in you that he wants to marry you.

1272
01:28:04,751 --> 01:28:07,709
But you should know that
I'm not interested in you at all.

1273
01:28:07,876 --> 01:28:11,584
Do you know why?
I'm also getting married.

1274
01:28:12,667 --> 01:28:16,417
Only if you could see the girl I'm
getting married to. She is so beautiful.

1275
01:28:16,626 --> 01:28:18,876
Can you do me a small favor?

1276
01:28:19,084 --> 01:28:19,876
What?

1277
01:28:20,334 --> 01:28:22,917
I overheard you talking
to your grandmother...

1278
01:28:23,001 --> 01:28:26,251
...about your marriage,
the harvest, the clothes.

1279
01:28:27,042 --> 01:28:30,542
All this will take at least 6 months.

1280
01:28:30,792 --> 01:28:33,209
If I lend a hand,
the same thing can be done in 3 months.

1281
01:28:33,417 --> 01:28:34,376
3 months?

1282
01:28:34,459 --> 01:28:37,417
Yes. If the marriage has to happen soon,
then I need to step in.

1283
01:28:37,501 --> 01:28:38,917
Will you help me?

1284
01:28:39,084 --> 01:28:40,834
For who? It’s my need after all.

1285
01:28:40,917 --> 01:28:42,042
Your need?

1286
01:28:42,959 --> 01:28:47,042
Your grandmother told me
to work for a living didn't she.

1287
01:28:47,126 --> 01:28:48,542
From today I have decided to do that.

1288
01:28:49,792 --> 01:28:53,584
But I don't have any money to pay you.

1289
01:28:53,917 --> 01:28:54,917
Did I ask for money?

1290
01:28:55,709 --> 01:28:59,417
If a person steals or works hard,
it's only for food.

1291
01:28:59,667 --> 01:29:02,042
Anyway you cook everyday for
yourself and your grandmother right?

1292
01:29:02,126 --> 01:29:05,292
Just give me food. I will work all day.

1293
01:29:10,959 --> 01:29:14,167
You asked for water.
Drink this porridge.

1294
01:29:20,126 --> 01:29:22,334
Sister, Sister, Sister.

1295
01:29:22,417 --> 01:29:24,001
What?

1296
01:29:24,084 --> 01:29:25,417
...a ball to play.

1297
01:29:27,876 --> 01:29:30,292
You see that abandoned car there?
Take whatever you want from it.

1298
01:29:30,376 --> 01:29:31,292
Go on!
- Hey! Come all of you.

1299
01:29:31,792 --> 01:29:33,709
Hey! I want that one.

1300
01:29:34,084 --> 01:29:36,042
Give it to me!
- No. It's mine

1301
01:29:49,959 --> 01:29:50,876
I love you.

1302
01:29:51,626 --> 01:29:52,417
What?

1303
01:29:53,001 --> 01:29:54,542
That is, give me that.

1304
01:29:54,626 --> 01:29:55,709
You said something else.

1305
01:29:55,792 --> 01:29:56,751
I love you.

1306
01:29:56,917 --> 01:29:57,751
What does it mean?

1307
01:29:58,042 --> 01:30:00,959
In English, that's the way you say.
Give that to me.

1308
01:30:01,376 --> 01:30:03,792
So this thief knows English too?

1309
01:30:03,876 --> 01:30:05,126
Just that phrase.

1310
01:30:06,709 --> 01:30:07,376
Here.

1311
01:30:07,667 --> 01:30:10,001
Thanks. Take this.

1312
01:30:41,792 --> 01:30:42,542
Dear!

1313
01:30:43,334 --> 01:30:44,126
I love you.

1314
01:30:44,459 --> 01:30:46,209
What?
- I love you.

1315
01:30:47,459 --> 01:30:48,417
Do you want this?

1316
01:30:49,876 --> 01:30:54,584
"Little dreams and little
hopes fill my heart."

1317
01:30:55,126 --> 01:30:59,834
"My heart is taking
little leaps towards you."

1318
01:31:00,542 --> 01:31:04,751
"Little thoughts of you
keep making my heart swing."

1319
01:31:04,834 --> 01:31:12,501
"What do I do?"

1320
01:31:14,042 --> 01:31:16,584
"My first look is at you."

1321
01:31:16,667 --> 01:31:19,334
"My first words of love are to you."

1322
01:31:19,417 --> 01:31:23,167
"My steps are only towards you."

1323
01:31:24,751 --> 01:31:27,292
"My first love is you."

1324
01:31:27,376 --> 01:31:29,917
"Till the end only with you."

1325
01:31:30,126 --> 01:31:33,584
"This is all my heart desires."

1326
01:31:34,876 --> 01:31:37,834
"Little dreams and little
hopes fill my heart."

1327
01:31:40,167 --> 01:31:43,459
"Little thoughts of you
keep making my heart swing."

1328
01:31:58,584 --> 01:32:00,042
Hey! I love you!

1329
01:32:01,751 --> 01:32:02,501
I love you!

1330
01:32:02,751 --> 01:32:03,501
This one?

1331
01:32:03,667 --> 01:32:05,167
Not that. I love you.

1332
01:32:05,251 --> 01:32:06,417
Is it this one?

1333
01:32:06,751 --> 01:32:08,001
No. That one. I love you!

1334
01:32:08,501 --> 01:32:09,876
This one?

1335
01:32:11,542 --> 01:32:13,001
"I love you."

1336
01:32:13,084 --> 01:32:13,959
"What does that mean?"

1337
01:32:14,042 --> 01:32:15,792
"It means, give it to me."

1338
01:32:16,709 --> 01:32:18,459
"Give it to me."

1339
01:32:39,417 --> 01:32:41,459
"I've come with love."

1340
01:32:41,917 --> 01:32:44,292
"I've won your friendship."

1341
01:32:44,709 --> 01:32:48,084
"Both your love and
friendship are mine now."

1342
01:32:50,042 --> 01:32:52,251
"You've brought the light."

1343
01:32:52,709 --> 01:32:55,334
"I've become your shadow now."

1344
01:32:55,417 --> 01:32:59,167
"Both in light and darkness,
you are with me."

1345
01:33:00,709 --> 01:33:06,001
"It's because of you
my heart beats faster."

1346
01:33:06,084 --> 01:33:10,334
"My life is for you now."

1347
01:33:10,876 --> 01:33:14,251
"Little dreams and little
hopes fill my heart."

1348
01:33:16,209 --> 01:33:19,334
"Little thoughts of you
keep making my heart swing."

1349
01:33:40,751 --> 01:33:41,876
Sita.

1350
01:33:44,709 --> 01:33:45,751
Sita.

1351
01:33:49,334 --> 01:33:51,709
How is it? Will he like it?

1352
01:33:52,126 --> 01:33:53,084
I love you.

1353
01:34:00,251 --> 01:34:03,459
It’s lovely. He will definitely love it.

1354
01:34:06,001 --> 01:34:06,584
Rama.

1355
01:34:06,667 --> 01:34:07,501
Tell me.

1356
01:34:07,584 --> 01:34:08,584
I will leave now.

1357
01:34:13,667 --> 01:34:14,542
You're leaving?

1358
01:34:14,626 --> 01:34:17,417
I told you.
The work will get done in two months.

1359
01:34:18,959 --> 01:34:22,751
The girl you're going
to marry is very lucky.

1360
01:34:23,292 --> 01:34:26,626
If you're so helpful
to an acquaintance like me.

1361
01:34:26,792 --> 01:34:29,834
Imagine how much you
will care for your wife.

1362
01:34:30,417 --> 01:34:32,876
The man you're going
to marry is even more lucky.

1363
01:34:33,501 --> 01:34:36,792
If you keep a person who is
so far away so close to your heart.

1364
01:34:37,126 --> 01:34:40,292
When you both meet he
will lose himself to you.

1365
01:34:41,626 --> 01:34:45,084
One lifetime isn't enough
for such deep love Ramalakshmi.

1366
01:34:46,209 --> 01:34:47,001
Bye.

1367
01:35:09,834 --> 01:35:15,167
"This is Goddess Sita's
wedding celebrations."

1368
01:35:15,501 --> 01:35:20,417
"This is Lord Ram's
wedding celebrations."

1369
01:35:43,417 --> 01:35:44,709
Sita!

1370
01:35:53,167 --> 01:35:56,959
There is a different time for
first night ask him to tie the knot.

1371
01:35:58,167 --> 01:36:02,251
Sita it's time to tie the knot.

1372
01:36:03,417 --> 01:36:05,126
Rama!
- Yes!

1373
01:36:31,292 --> 01:36:32,917
I love you.

1374
01:36:35,709 --> 01:36:37,209
I love you.

1375
01:36:46,167 --> 01:36:47,751
I love you.

1376
01:36:49,834 --> 01:36:51,542
I love you.

1377
01:36:54,792 --> 01:36:56,334
I love you.

1378
01:36:57,834 --> 01:36:59,626
I love you.

1379
01:37:00,292 --> 01:37:01,542
I love you.

1380
01:37:02,501 --> 01:37:04,376
Please give it to me this way.

1381
01:37:28,542 --> 01:37:31,709
"You have come as a friend."

1382
01:37:31,792 --> 01:37:34,251
"You have become my partner."

1383
01:37:34,334 --> 01:37:38,417
"You have given me the gift of love."

1384
01:37:39,626 --> 01:37:42,292
"We started as the two of us."

1385
01:37:42,376 --> 01:37:44,959
"Now we are only one."

1386
01:37:45,042 --> 01:37:49,292
"And our love has come as another."

1387
01:37:50,376 --> 01:37:53,001
"You have shared only love."

1388
01:37:53,084 --> 01:37:55,626
"Nourished my soul."

1389
01:37:55,709 --> 01:38:00,251
"Our love has now become
the child we share."

1390
01:38:00,459 --> 01:38:04,042
"Little dreams and little
hopes fill my heart."

1391
01:38:05,876 --> 01:38:09,417
"Little thoughts of you
keep making my heart swing."

1392
01:38:16,792 --> 01:38:20,917
"Little dreams and little
hopes fill my heart."

1393
01:38:22,209 --> 01:38:26,084
"Little thoughts of you
keep making my heart swing."

1394
01:38:27,126 --> 01:38:31,501
"Little dreams and little
hopes fill my heart."

1395
01:38:31,876 --> 01:38:35,126
"What do I do?"

1396
01:38:35,709 --> 01:38:38,334
"My first love is you."

1397
01:38:38,376 --> 01:38:40,959
"Till the end only with you."

1398
01:38:41,042 --> 01:38:45,709
"This is the beat of our hearts."

1399
01:38:45,876 --> 01:38:49,376
"Little dreams and little
hopes fill our hearts."

1400
01:38:51,167 --> 01:38:55,459
"Little thoughts make our hearts swing."

1401
01:39:10,292 --> 01:39:11,292
Let me check.

1402
01:39:15,042 --> 01:39:18,084
You still have fever.

1403
01:39:22,542 --> 01:39:25,459
There is no way you can come with us.

1404
01:39:25,542 --> 01:39:28,626
Then you don't leave me and go.

1405
01:39:28,709 --> 01:39:31,917
Chaitanya.
- Rama.

1406
01:39:32,251 --> 01:39:33,376
I am coming.

1407
01:39:33,459 --> 01:39:34,501
Mother.

1408
01:39:36,876 --> 01:39:37,959
You carry on.

1409
01:39:38,042 --> 01:39:40,209
Chaitanya is not well
I will stay with him.

1410
01:39:40,292 --> 01:39:42,334
I cannot go there without you Rama.

1411
01:39:43,001 --> 01:39:44,876
They told us so many times
that we both have to be there.

1412
01:39:45,417 --> 01:39:47,417
But he has fever.

1413
01:39:47,501 --> 01:39:49,417
My mother and your grandmother
will take care of him.

1414
01:40:02,959 --> 01:40:03,751
Anji.

1415
01:40:04,584 --> 01:40:07,209
Anji, what are you doing? Venkaiah.

1416
01:40:07,292 --> 01:40:08,084
Yes sir.

1417
01:40:08,626 --> 01:40:10,376
Venkaiah come here, take him away.

1418
01:40:10,751 --> 01:40:11,376
Anji

1419
01:40:11,459 --> 01:40:12,626
Give him something to eat.

1420
01:40:12,834 --> 01:40:15,459
He will stop barking then. Let’s go Rama.

1421
01:40:24,876 --> 01:40:28,459
This movement is to end
the foreign rule over us.

1422
01:40:28,542 --> 01:40:36,417
Everyone will have to come together
to make this movement a success.

1423
01:40:36,501 --> 01:40:38,209
Civilians must become soldiers.

1424
01:40:38,292 --> 01:40:39,709
Vande Mataram.
(Praises to Mother India)

1425
01:40:39,792 --> 01:40:41,251
Vande Mataram.
(Praises to Mother India)

1426
01:40:41,334 --> 01:40:42,376
Vande Mataram.
(Praises to Mother India)

1427
01:40:42,459 --> 01:40:43,667
Vande Mataram.
(Praises to Mother India)

1428
01:40:43,751 --> 01:40:47,417
Gandhiji has come all the way
from Delhi they have gone to meet him.

1429
01:40:47,501 --> 01:40:50,584
They will return this evening.
- Where is the little one?

1430
01:40:50,667 --> 01:40:51,792
Grandma.

1431
01:40:51,876 --> 01:40:54,459
What is it?
- My stomach hurts grandma.

1432
01:40:54,584 --> 01:40:55,376
Stomach ache?

1433
01:40:55,417 --> 01:40:57,751
Call Mother and Father, now.

1434
01:41:00,042 --> 01:41:00,667
Mom.

1435
01:41:08,251 --> 01:41:09,542
Drive faster.

1436
01:41:10,001 --> 01:41:11,792
I am. We will be there in 5 minutes.

1437
01:41:12,126 --> 01:41:13,626
I told you that I would not come.

1438
01:41:14,459 --> 01:41:17,042
Rama, Mother is with him.
She will take care of him.

1439
01:41:17,126 --> 01:41:18,459
Nothing will happen to him.

1440
01:41:19,042 --> 01:41:21,792
What if he is in a lot of pain?
He must be struggling.

1441
01:41:22,542 --> 01:41:25,959
Look, please don't cry.
I can’t bear your tears.

1442
01:41:26,042 --> 01:41:28,334
You know that, don't you?
Here take this.

1443
01:41:29,001 --> 01:41:29,834
Rama.

1444
01:41:30,292 --> 01:41:31,251
Rama, don't cry.

1445
01:42:08,209 --> 01:42:10,042
What if he is in pain?

1446
01:42:11,417 --> 01:42:12,917
I hope nothing happens to him.

1447
01:42:13,334 --> 01:42:15,001
Nothing will happen to him.

1448
01:42:16,667 --> 01:42:20,959
He will take on our life
and live a very long life.

1449
01:42:47,709 --> 01:42:49,417
80 years have passed...

1450
01:42:49,501 --> 01:42:52,917
...without me knowing whether
it was their blessing or Gods curse.

1451
01:42:53,001 --> 01:42:55,042
I have spent so much
time in hurt and guilt...

1452
01:42:55,126 --> 01:42:58,417
...searching for ways
to redeem myself of my mistake.

1453
01:42:58,501 --> 01:43:00,042
I prayed to God many times...

1454
01:43:00,126 --> 01:43:03,584
...if a mistake of a child
warranted such a huge punishment.

1455
01:43:03,667 --> 01:43:07,667
I lost my parents when I pretended
to have pain that I didn't.

1456
01:43:07,751 --> 01:43:10,834
But God brought them back
to me when I was really in pain.

1457
01:43:10,917 --> 01:43:19,959
My responsibility now is to help
my parents live a long and happy life...

1458
01:43:20,667 --> 01:43:23,042
...together with children...

1459
01:43:23,251 --> 01:43:24,834
...grandchildren and
great-grandchildren...

1460
01:43:24,917 --> 01:43:26,542
...just as I have lived mine.

1461
01:43:46,542 --> 01:43:49,751
She isn't wearing a toe ring.
That means she is not married.

1462
01:43:50,376 --> 01:43:52,084
What about father? I should find out.

1463
01:44:01,876 --> 01:44:04,334
What happened? You seem distracted.

1464
01:44:04,417 --> 01:44:05,626
Nothing like that.

1465
01:44:06,001 --> 01:44:09,709
Until now I've seen and met many women,
but never felt anything.

1466
01:44:09,876 --> 01:44:12,084
I've always been consumed
by work and nothing else.

1467
01:44:12,292 --> 01:44:14,959
Somehow. when I saw this girl,
my heart began to beat faster.

1468
01:44:15,126 --> 01:44:17,084
The closer she came, the faster it beat.

1469
01:44:17,167 --> 01:44:19,001
Oh my God! That's so sweet.

1470
01:44:19,167 --> 01:44:20,834
You finally in love.

1471
01:44:21,167 --> 01:44:22,792
Tell me, tell me, tell me.
Who is this girl?

1472
01:44:22,834 --> 01:44:23,626
She is...

1473
01:44:23,709 --> 01:44:24,792
Wait a minute.

1474
01:44:25,292 --> 01:44:27,251
Apparently a lot is
happening behind my back.

1475
01:44:27,834 --> 01:44:28,709
Anyway, it’s alright.

1476
01:44:28,792 --> 01:44:29,917
It is enough if you like her.

1477
01:44:30,001 --> 01:44:31,459
I mean it’s not like there's any rule
that I should also like her, is there?

1478
01:44:31,542 --> 01:44:33,001
Oh, no. Look here.

1479
01:44:33,167 --> 01:44:35,834
How can I do anything you don't like?
You have to approve everything.

1480
01:44:36,001 --> 01:44:37,459
If that's the case,
I have a few conditions.

1481
01:44:37,751 --> 01:44:39,626
The girl has to be very beautiful.

1482
01:44:39,709 --> 01:44:40,834
She must have long hair.

1483
01:44:40,959 --> 01:44:41,959
And...

1484
01:44:42,042 --> 01:44:43,542
We must find out her family background.
- Okay.

1485
01:44:43,626 --> 01:44:44,876
In matters of marriage,
that is very important.

1486
01:44:45,667 --> 01:44:46,501
What does she do?

1487
01:44:47,001 --> 01:44:47,667
She is a doctor.

1488
01:44:47,834 --> 01:44:49,001
Doctor?

1489
01:44:49,292 --> 01:44:53,042
Wow. Doctor?
There should be a doctor at home Bittu.

1490
01:44:53,126 --> 01:44:54,584
If anything happens to
anyone she will take care.

1491
01:44:56,042 --> 01:44:58,251
Bittu, you're running such a high
temperature. Why didn't you tell me?

1492
01:44:58,417 --> 01:45:01,001
Come lets go to the doctor.
- I don't have fever.

1493
01:45:01,251 --> 01:45:03,126
Oh God. We will go to our doctor.

1494
01:45:05,459 --> 01:45:06,709
Come, come.
- Okay.

1495
01:45:09,292 --> 01:45:11,959
If we tell the receptionist the doctors
name, we can get her details easily.

1496
01:45:12,042 --> 01:45:13,334
What is her name?

1497
01:45:14,167 --> 01:45:15,376
I don't know.

1498
01:45:16,167 --> 01:45:17,751
What? Love without knowing her name?

1499
01:45:18,917 --> 01:45:20,917
Alright, do you at least
know the patients name?

1500
01:45:21,001 --> 01:45:21,709
No.

1501
01:45:22,334 --> 01:45:23,667
Then how are we supposed to find her?

1502
01:45:26,751 --> 01:45:29,584
Oh I see.
Is your heart some kind of GPS?

1503
01:45:30,126 --> 01:45:32,126
We have to search everywhere. Come on.
- Okay.

1504
01:45:32,584 --> 01:45:34,084
Do you feel anything?
- No, my heart is beating normally.

1505
01:45:34,167 --> 01:45:34,959
Wait.

1506
01:45:41,209 --> 01:45:42,209
God knows where she is.

1507
01:45:47,334 --> 01:45:48,251
Okay, come.

1508
01:46:05,376 --> 01:46:06,126
What happened?

1509
01:46:06,292 --> 01:46:07,626
She is definitely somewhere nearby.

1510
01:46:11,167 --> 01:46:12,126
How do you know?

1511
01:46:13,459 --> 01:46:16,084
Beating faster is it? Let’s go.

1512
01:46:48,209 --> 01:46:49,084
It’s you.

1513
01:46:49,251 --> 01:46:50,084
Yes. And you.

1514
01:46:50,834 --> 01:46:54,126
I'm taking care of the patient. You?

1515
01:46:54,209 --> 01:46:55,501
I came to see you...

1516
01:46:59,542 --> 01:47:01,126
You want your blood back?

1517
01:47:01,334 --> 01:47:02,917
Yes. No, no, no.

1518
01:47:03,334 --> 01:47:06,251
I came to enquire how it is working.

1519
01:47:07,667 --> 01:47:08,876
How the blood is working?

1520
01:47:09,417 --> 01:47:11,959
Well, it’s working quite well.

1521
01:47:17,292 --> 01:47:18,626
Please, come in.

1522
01:47:23,126 --> 01:47:25,417
Do you like her?

1523
01:47:26,917 --> 01:47:31,667
Bittu, she's perfect. I love her.

1524
01:47:45,251 --> 01:47:46,876
Hello, Uncle. Are you better?

1525
01:47:46,959 --> 01:47:48,042
Much better.

1526
01:47:48,126 --> 01:47:52,376
I'm very well. I'm so happy. So happy.

1527
01:47:52,584 --> 01:47:54,417
Uncle, you remember him?

1528
01:47:54,501 --> 01:47:58,167
How can I forget him?
We have a blood relationship don't we?

1529
01:47:59,459 --> 01:48:06,917
You've helped me so much,
but I didn't even get to ask your name.

1530
01:48:07,001 --> 01:48:07,917
What is your name?

1531
01:48:11,376 --> 01:48:13,584
I'm Nageshwara Rao.
You can call me Nageshwar.

1532
01:48:15,126 --> 01:48:16,167
Hi, I'm Anjali.

1533
01:48:16,251 --> 01:48:16,876
Hi.

1534
01:48:17,334 --> 01:48:18,251
Cardiologist.

1535
01:48:18,459 --> 01:48:20,876
Bittu she's a cardiologist.

1536
01:48:20,959 --> 01:48:21,959
Shall we tell her?

1537
01:48:24,209 --> 01:48:26,417
About your heart beating faster.

1538
01:48:27,167 --> 01:48:27,959
What happened?

1539
01:48:28,042 --> 01:48:29,376
What is it, dear?
- Uncle?

1540
01:48:29,584 --> 01:48:30,251
Are you unwell?

1541
01:48:30,334 --> 01:48:32,167
I'm fine Uncle. It’s nothing.
- Bittu.

1542
01:48:32,792 --> 01:48:33,417
Just tell her.

1543
01:48:33,501 --> 01:48:37,667
In any case why don't you get
a check up? It's better. Why don't you...

1544
01:48:38,251 --> 01:48:39,126
Come.
- Go. Go, Bittu.

1545
01:48:39,209 --> 01:48:40,126
Okay.

1546
01:48:45,376 --> 01:48:46,251
Tell me.

1547
01:48:46,459 --> 01:48:48,959
I feel my heart beating
faster than usual.

1548
01:48:49,042 --> 01:48:51,084
When do you feel that?

1549
01:48:51,126 --> 01:48:54,167
Remember we met in the car yesterday?
I felt it then.

1550
01:49:02,751 --> 01:49:04,959
And now again,
I felt it when I came to the hospital.

1551
01:49:05,126 --> 01:49:07,126
You opened the door,
and it got back to normal.

1552
01:49:09,626 --> 01:49:12,084
Your heart is absolutely fine.

1553
01:49:13,792 --> 01:49:17,209
So far I've been
taking care of everything.

1554
01:49:17,292 --> 01:49:19,876
But now, we have to discharge you.

1555
01:49:20,042 --> 01:49:21,417
If a family member of yours comes...

1556
01:49:29,042 --> 01:49:29,917
Uncle.

1557
01:49:30,834 --> 01:49:32,084
What happened, Uncle?

1558
01:49:32,292 --> 01:49:33,251
Why are you crying?

1559
01:49:34,792 --> 01:49:36,251
It’s nothing.

1560
01:49:37,042 --> 01:49:38,542
You said discharge, right?

1561
01:49:39,626 --> 01:49:41,751
If you just give me the bill,
I will pay and leave.

1562
01:49:41,917 --> 01:49:43,001
Alone?

1563
01:49:43,084 --> 01:49:45,334
No, no. Let’s call your family.

1564
01:49:45,417 --> 01:49:47,001
There isn't anyone to call.

1565
01:49:47,084 --> 01:49:48,376
What do you mean Uncle?

1566
01:49:48,459 --> 01:49:49,751
I'm all alone.

1567
01:49:49,834 --> 01:49:52,542
How can I let you go like that?

1568
01:49:52,626 --> 01:49:54,001
We shall go to my apartment.

1569
01:49:54,167 --> 01:49:56,584
There's nobody there but me.
It will be peaceful.

1570
01:49:59,334 --> 01:50:01,834
Excuse me do you have
to check him every day?

1571
01:50:02,334 --> 01:50:04,042
Do you have to check Uncle every day?

1572
01:50:04,501 --> 01:50:05,917
Then there is a problem.

1573
01:50:06,917 --> 01:50:09,501
If Uncle is at your place
he will be left unattended...

1574
01:50:09,584 --> 01:50:11,751
...when you come to the hospital right?

1575
01:50:12,917 --> 01:50:14,584
There is only one solution for this.
- What?

1576
01:50:14,667 --> 01:50:15,876
Let uncle come and stay at my house.

1577
01:50:18,292 --> 01:50:20,792
I don't have a problem,
but it is Uncles choice.

1578
01:50:21,084 --> 01:50:22,417
Uncle.
- I'm not okay with that.

1579
01:50:22,792 --> 01:50:24,459
What? Why?

1580
01:50:24,542 --> 01:50:27,917
I don't want to be a burden
on your wife and children.

1581
01:50:28,001 --> 01:50:29,376
I'm not married yet.

1582
01:50:29,459 --> 01:50:30,584
I don't have children.
- What?

1583
01:50:30,667 --> 01:50:31,667
I'm single.

1584
01:50:32,417 --> 01:50:37,042
I'm a bachelor. Apart from my parents,
there is nobody else in my heart.

1585
01:50:37,417 --> 01:50:39,376
You will come every day, right?

1586
01:50:45,001 --> 01:50:45,959
Welcome Uncle.

1587
01:50:46,751 --> 01:50:47,709
Hi, Buddy.

1588
01:50:47,792 --> 01:50:49,709
This is my best friend, Buddy.

1589
01:50:56,001 --> 01:50:57,751
What are you looking at?

1590
01:50:59,876 --> 01:51:03,376
That car? Since I was young
I've been crazy about that car.

1591
01:51:03,667 --> 01:51:05,167
Come, I will show you to your room.

1592
01:51:06,459 --> 01:51:08,876
ST. XAVIER'S COLLAGE
BOYS HOSTEL, BLOCK - A

1593
01:51:09,126 --> 01:51:10,709
Sorry, sorry. Praise the Lord Father.

1594
01:51:10,792 --> 01:51:11,959
May the Lord be praised.

1595
01:51:12,417 --> 01:51:13,459
It’s not enough that
you look at the floor.

1596
01:51:13,542 --> 01:51:14,792
You have to look up and
down when you're walking.

1597
01:51:15,126 --> 01:51:17,667
Fa.. Fa.. Father. Fa.. Fa.. Father.

1598
01:51:19,917 --> 01:51:21,209
Praise the Lord Father.

1599
01:51:22,334 --> 01:51:23,959
Raise this father, my son!

1600
01:51:24,042 --> 01:51:24,834
Is it hurting, Father?

1601
01:51:24,917 --> 01:51:26,209
It's exploding, my son.

1602
01:51:26,292 --> 01:51:28,167
Oh God. It looks like
your back is broken.

1603
01:51:28,251 --> 01:51:30,584
Come on, Father.
Shall I get some medicine for you?

1604
01:51:31,959 --> 01:51:34,251
Shut it and go, my son.

1605
01:51:34,334 --> 01:51:35,334
As you wish. Bye.

1606
01:51:36,667 --> 01:51:37,417
Father, praise the Lord.

1607
01:51:37,501 --> 01:51:39,167
The Lord may... oh.

1608
01:51:42,334 --> 01:51:45,542
What is this?
I can smell alcohol in the hostel.

1609
01:51:55,209 --> 01:51:56,459
My son.

1610
01:51:57,626 --> 01:51:59,542
Praise the Lord Father.
Praise the Lord Father.

1611
01:51:59,626 --> 01:52:01,042
May the Lord be praised.

1612
01:52:01,126 --> 01:52:03,792
What happened my Son? Sit, sit.

1613
01:52:03,876 --> 01:52:05,792
My heart has been destroyed Father.

1614
01:52:05,876 --> 01:52:06,876
I understand.

1615
01:52:06,917 --> 01:52:10,292
40 years back, the same thing happened
to me. That is why I'm like this now.

1616
01:52:10,376 --> 01:52:13,751
Really? Meaning that
Prema hurt your heart too?

1617
01:52:13,834 --> 01:52:17,876
It’s because my heart got hurt that
I became a father to idiots like you.

1618
01:52:18,167 --> 01:52:21,209
Otherwise I would have
been a father to my own children.

1619
01:52:21,292 --> 01:52:24,542
Father, Father, Father. If you have
a spare dress, please give it to me.

1620
01:52:24,626 --> 01:52:26,334
I will also become a Father like you.

1621
01:52:26,417 --> 01:52:29,209
Don't play with the my faith, my son.

1622
01:52:29,292 --> 01:52:32,459
I can understand your
broken heart and drunken soul.

1623
01:52:33,042 --> 01:52:35,084
Love is always pure.

1624
01:52:35,417 --> 01:52:38,334
If at all there are problems,
they arise only because of humans.

1625
01:52:38,542 --> 01:52:40,709
But there is no connection
between those people and me, Father.

1626
01:52:40,792 --> 01:52:44,626
No, my son. You shouldn't say things
like that. You and those people are one.

1627
01:52:44,709 --> 01:52:46,042
No, Father.
- Yes, my son.

1628
01:52:46,126 --> 01:52:47,917
No, Father. No, I am not agreed.
- Yes.

1629
01:52:47,959 --> 01:52:49,167
Yes, my son.

1630
01:52:51,917 --> 01:52:54,292
That side. That side.

1631
01:52:55,501 --> 01:52:57,792
"Love is so sweet."

1632
01:52:58,042 --> 01:53:00,542
"Parting is very difficult."

1633
01:53:01,417 --> 01:53:03,417
Get out!

1634
01:53:10,501 --> 01:53:12,751
Bittu, Bittu, Bittu.

1635
01:53:12,834 --> 01:53:13,501
Hey!

1636
01:53:14,001 --> 01:53:14,876
Who are you?

1637
01:53:14,959 --> 01:53:15,792
Isn't Bittu here?

1638
01:53:16,001 --> 01:53:17,584
No Bittu, no Kittu. Get out of here.

1639
01:53:18,042 --> 01:53:19,251
Drinking at this age.

1640
01:53:19,334 --> 01:53:21,667
I must've come to the wrong house.
Sorry, sorry. My mistake.

1641
01:53:24,001 --> 01:53:27,251
I think I drank too
much and came to next house.

1642
01:53:32,959 --> 01:53:34,417
Why did you come again?

1643
01:53:34,501 --> 01:53:36,376
Is Mr. Nageshwara Rao here, Sir?

1644
01:53:36,459 --> 01:53:38,251
Oh you've come for him?

1645
01:53:38,876 --> 01:53:44,792
Looking at you, I thought
you were the owner of the house.

1646
01:53:44,876 --> 01:53:46,126
You work here then?
- Hey!

1647
01:53:46,459 --> 01:53:47,376
What's your name?

1648
01:53:47,459 --> 01:53:48,834
Chai. Chaitanya.

1649
01:53:49,084 --> 01:53:54,501
Oh God. Chai, Chaitanya. You
say it as if you're Bond, James Bond.

1650
01:53:55,459 --> 01:53:57,709
Not bad. You have a youthful name.

1651
01:53:57,959 --> 01:54:01,126
Not just in my name. In me, too.

1652
01:54:01,209 --> 01:54:03,126
That’s good for me, then.

1653
01:54:03,834 --> 01:54:09,417
I will give you something to do, Mr.
Chai. You can bring my luggage in.

1654
01:54:09,501 --> 01:54:10,626
Hey!

1655
01:54:10,709 --> 01:54:11,959
How dare you?

1656
01:54:12,209 --> 01:54:14,876
You tell a man your grandfathers
age to bring in your luggage?

1657
01:54:15,084 --> 01:54:17,792
If you're as old as my grandfather,
then I'm as old as your grandson.

1658
01:54:17,876 --> 01:54:20,126
Can’t you do it for your grandson?

1659
01:54:20,376 --> 01:54:24,709
And you were saying that there's
youth in you. Go on. Give it a try.

1660
01:54:24,792 --> 01:54:26,209
It’s not your fault.
I will talk to Bittu.

1661
01:54:26,292 --> 01:54:27,709
Hey! Hey!
- Bittu! Bittu!

1662
01:54:27,792 --> 01:54:30,251
Dad! When did you come?
- Hi Bittu!

1663
01:54:30,501 --> 01:54:31,626
Bittu, what is this?

1664
01:54:31,709 --> 01:54:33,834
Why is your housekeeper wearing
such expensive clothes?

1665
01:54:33,917 --> 01:54:36,542
You should hire young and strong staff.

1666
01:54:36,834 --> 01:54:40,126
He is right. You should hire him.

1667
01:54:40,209 --> 01:54:44,626
He is fit enough. He will be able
to clean the floor and wash the clothes.

1668
01:54:45,167 --> 01:54:46,584
What is this Bittu?
- Calm down.

1669
01:54:48,167 --> 01:54:50,709
He is a very important person.
His name is Chaitanya.

1670
01:54:50,917 --> 01:54:54,459
This is my fath...
I mean my best friend, Nagarjuna.

1671
01:54:54,709 --> 01:54:57,792
Why are you close to people who drink in
the middle of the day and cause trouble?

1672
01:54:57,876 --> 01:55:01,209
Bittu. I drank during
the day because of that.

1673
01:55:01,292 --> 01:55:03,626
Yes. Every drunkard
has a reason to get drunk.

1674
01:55:03,709 --> 01:55:05,709
Hey Bittu! I need another drink.
- Okay, dad!

1675
01:55:05,792 --> 01:55:07,251
Sure, dad!
- Let's go to the bar.

1676
01:55:07,334 --> 01:55:09,667
Give him a full bottle.
He will drink and fall flat.

1677
01:55:09,751 --> 01:55:10,667
Bittu.

1678
01:55:10,751 --> 01:55:12,209
That crazy Francis.

1679
01:55:12,292 --> 01:55:13,251
What did he do?

1680
01:55:13,334 --> 01:55:14,959
What's it to him if I drink Bittu?

1681
01:55:15,042 --> 01:55:17,459
Yes, you were drinking outside
somewhere. What's it to him?

1682
01:55:17,501 --> 01:55:19,709
No Bittu, I drank in the hostel only.

1683
01:55:20,501 --> 01:55:22,667
even if you drank in the hostel you
wouldn't have created a nuisance right?

1684
01:55:22,917 --> 01:55:26,001
No Bittu. I drank,
and then I threw up a little.

1685
01:55:27,376 --> 01:55:29,334
What's the big deal? When people drink
a little too much they do throw up.

1686
01:55:29,417 --> 01:55:30,584
You can clean that.

1687
01:55:30,667 --> 01:55:33,709
Bittu, if it falls on the floor,
someone can clean it.

1688
01:55:34,001 --> 01:55:37,501
He came and stood right in front of me.
A little bit fell on his shirt.

1689
01:55:40,459 --> 01:55:42,417
If it fell on his clothes
he can change them, right?

1690
01:55:42,834 --> 01:55:46,417
When I threw up,
a little fell in his mouth.

1691
01:55:48,292 --> 01:55:50,584
Because of that he got mad.

1692
01:55:51,001 --> 01:55:53,667
He could have warned me, fined me.

1693
01:55:53,959 --> 01:55:56,084
How can he send me out of the hostel?
- Correct.

1694
01:55:56,167 --> 01:55:57,334
That’s a bit much?

1695
01:55:57,834 --> 01:56:03,834
That isn't called sending out.
It’s called throwing out.

1696
01:56:04,084 --> 01:56:05,584
Mr. Chaitanya.

1697
01:56:05,667 --> 01:56:09,292
I'm keeping quiet because you are
Bittu's close friend. Otherwise...

1698
01:56:09,376 --> 01:56:13,709
Even I'm keeping quiet because
you're close to him. Otherwise...

1699
01:56:13,792 --> 01:56:16,167
Why are you even friends
with this drunkard?

1700
01:56:16,542 --> 01:56:19,126
Two young guys will
obviously be friends.

1701
01:56:19,209 --> 01:56:21,542
Why would he hang out
with an old man like you.

1702
01:56:21,626 --> 01:56:23,042
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1703
01:56:23,251 --> 01:56:25,084
Old? Who are you calling old?

1704
01:56:25,334 --> 01:56:29,709
Everyone becomes old someday.
You will also become old.

1705
01:56:29,959 --> 01:56:32,292
Old is diamond, not gold.

1706
01:56:32,751 --> 01:56:36,501
You call yourself young?
Do you even know what being young is?

1707
01:56:36,584 --> 01:56:41,209
In my day do you know what fun I had?
What romance I did?

1708
01:56:41,292 --> 01:56:43,917
For all that, you need discipline.

1709
01:56:44,167 --> 01:56:46,584
If you keep drinking like this,
you will become old in no time.

1710
01:56:46,667 --> 01:56:48,542
Is it your heart that broke,
or your love that failed?

1711
01:56:49,209 --> 01:56:50,667
You are you preaching so much.

1712
01:56:50,751 --> 01:56:54,709
If you ever failed in love once, you
will understand what I'm going through.

1713
01:56:54,792 --> 01:57:01,834
Every drunkard uses the excuse
of failed love to drink. What rubbish.

1714
01:57:02,209 --> 01:57:04,501
Why don't you quit drinking?

1715
01:57:04,709 --> 01:57:07,334
Alright. But I will quit
after you have a drink with me.

1716
01:57:07,417 --> 01:57:08,042
Me?

1717
01:57:08,126 --> 01:57:11,251
Yes. Have a drink with me.
After that I will stop.

1718
01:57:11,334 --> 01:57:13,459
Useless fellow.

1719
01:57:13,542 --> 01:57:15,709
You go ahead and drink if you want,
spoil your own health.

1720
01:57:15,792 --> 01:57:17,709
Why are you asking him to join you?

1721
01:57:17,792 --> 01:57:20,584
Don't worry so much about him.
Even I have love for him.

1722
01:57:20,667 --> 01:57:23,792
He is as important to me
as he is to you. What say, Bittu?

1723
01:57:24,376 --> 01:57:26,209
You have a drink with me, Bittu.

1724
01:57:26,292 --> 01:57:29,251
I can’t understand who this guy is?

1725
01:57:30,376 --> 01:57:31,584
Here, take this.

1726
01:57:32,376 --> 01:57:34,084
What is this?

1727
01:57:36,501 --> 01:57:38,084
I think I will fall
flat just with the smell.

1728
01:57:38,167 --> 01:57:39,542
Why are you entertaining him?

1729
01:57:39,626 --> 01:57:40,876
Why are you drinking
when you don't have the habit?

1730
01:57:40,959 --> 01:57:43,626
Uncle, do you drink?

1731
01:57:43,709 --> 01:57:45,376
Me? Once in a while.
- Yes.

1732
01:57:45,459 --> 01:57:46,792
Then drink this.

1733
01:57:46,917 --> 01:57:48,209
Me? In front of you?

1734
01:57:48,292 --> 01:57:50,501
Not in front of me. Behind me. Here.

1735
01:57:50,584 --> 01:57:53,501
Behind you?
Alright give it here. I will drink it.

1736
01:57:58,709 --> 01:57:59,959
Cheers, Bittu.

1737
01:58:00,792 --> 01:58:03,126
You drank the full thing
without waiting for me?

1738
01:58:03,209 --> 01:58:05,251
He is new to this, right?
Gulped it down.

1739
01:58:05,334 --> 01:58:08,292
Drink slowly, Bittu.
Don't listen to the old man.

1740
01:58:08,376 --> 01:58:09,167
Yes, drink slowly.

1741
01:58:12,667 --> 01:58:15,167
Uncle, Uncle. Where is he?

1742
01:58:18,334 --> 01:58:19,209
Where is Uncle?

1743
01:58:24,751 --> 01:58:27,417
What is this?
You drank and you are steady.

1744
01:58:27,876 --> 01:58:30,292
He didn't drink but he is swaying?

1745
01:58:31,376 --> 01:58:35,126
I'm not swaying. I'm very steady.

1746
01:58:35,626 --> 01:58:40,042
Something's not right here. You
have to drink this in front of me now.

1747
01:58:40,126 --> 01:58:45,001
I won’t believe it until I see.
Drink it all up. Drink.

1748
01:58:46,417 --> 01:58:47,292
Did you see that?

1749
01:58:47,917 --> 01:58:50,042
"Hey! No stopping!"

1750
01:58:50,126 --> 01:58:52,084
"We are losing."

1751
01:59:03,959 --> 01:59:05,584
"Let's party everybody!"

1752
01:59:14,209 --> 01:59:16,167
"Open the bottle."

1753
01:59:16,417 --> 01:59:18,667
"Bring a glass."

1754
01:59:18,751 --> 01:59:20,626
"Fill it to the brim."

1755
01:59:20,834 --> 01:59:23,209
"Let's enjoy the drink."

1756
01:59:27,334 --> 01:59:29,667
"You will get high."

1757
01:59:29,751 --> 01:59:31,917
"Enjoy to the fullest."

1758
01:59:34,042 --> 01:59:36,126
"Lead life like a king."

1759
01:59:36,209 --> 01:59:39,792
"I see heaven when I have that nectar."

1760
01:59:40,501 --> 01:59:44,584
"Ditch you sorrows,
go ahead and keep smiling."

1761
01:59:44,667 --> 01:59:48,584
"Drink! Drink! Drink the entire thing!"

1762
01:59:49,084 --> 01:59:53,709
"Irrespective of date or time, when
you drink this, you become the King."

1763
01:59:53,792 --> 01:59:57,417
"Go ahead and drink the whole thing."

1764
01:59:57,626 --> 02:00:01,084
"Go ahead and drink the whole thing."

1765
02:00:02,584 --> 02:00:06,209
"Go ahead and drink the whole thing."

1766
02:00:06,292 --> 02:00:08,876
"Go ahead and drink the whole thing."

1767
02:00:08,959 --> 02:00:11,334
"I am losing my mind."

1768
02:00:11,417 --> 02:00:13,501
"Do you think you are losing
your state of mind."

1769
02:00:13,584 --> 02:00:15,667
"Man! Oh my man! Think over it!"

1770
02:00:15,751 --> 02:00:17,876
"We are the finest in the town!"

1771
02:00:17,959 --> 02:00:20,001
"I was born."

1772
02:00:22,376 --> 02:00:26,584
"Society was overjoyed when I was born."

1773
02:00:26,792 --> 02:00:30,959
"When I cried, world smiled at me."

1774
02:00:31,167 --> 02:00:35,459
"When I smiled,
it was world's turn to cry."

1775
02:00:35,542 --> 02:00:39,917
"I don't have any more business
in this world."

1776
02:00:40,001 --> 02:00:42,417
"I don't care!"

1777
02:00:42,501 --> 02:00:44,376
"We don't care."

1778
02:00:44,459 --> 02:00:46,876
"Say this! Say it all."

1779
02:00:48,751 --> 02:00:50,709
"Don't be shy! Come over and dance."

1780
02:00:50,792 --> 02:00:53,167
"Come and be the king of night."

1781
02:00:53,251 --> 02:00:55,334
"King! This is a calling."

1782
02:00:55,417 --> 02:00:57,834
"Come on and dance with us."

1783
02:01:06,501 --> 02:01:07,834
"Open the bottle!"

1784
02:01:08,584 --> 02:01:10,667
"Take a glass!"

1785
02:01:10,959 --> 02:01:12,876
"Drink it fully."

1786
02:01:12,959 --> 02:01:15,376
"Come let's have a drink."

1787
02:01:15,459 --> 02:01:18,876
"Go ahead and drink the whole thing."

1788
02:01:18,959 --> 02:01:22,042
"Go ahead and drink the whole thing."

1789
02:01:24,001 --> 02:01:27,709
"Go ahead and drink the whole thing."

1790
02:01:27,792 --> 02:01:30,792
"Go ahead and drink the whole thing."

1791
02:01:32,667 --> 02:01:36,959
"Society was overjoyed when I was born."

1792
02:01:37,209 --> 02:01:41,292
"When I cried, World smiled at me."

1793
02:01:41,626 --> 02:01:45,626
"When I smiled,
it was world's turn to cry."

1794
02:01:45,917 --> 02:01:50,167
"I don't have any more
business in this world."

1795
02:01:50,417 --> 02:01:52,584
"I don't care!"

1796
02:03:13,251 --> 02:03:15,042
Bittu.
- You must call me Bittu.

1797
02:03:15,917 --> 02:03:17,209
Bittu.

1798
02:03:36,792 --> 02:03:37,876
Bittu.

1799
02:05:11,959 --> 02:05:14,542
What is that smell? I smell Alcohol.

1800
02:05:17,542 --> 02:05:18,376
Uncle.

1801
02:05:20,792 --> 02:05:22,417
Don't disturb me.

1802
02:05:22,626 --> 02:05:24,417
Uncle.
- Oh, you.

1803
02:05:24,959 --> 02:05:26,334
Uncle.

1804
02:05:28,501 --> 02:05:31,001
What is this? Did you drink?

1805
02:05:32,084 --> 02:05:34,834
We gave him just two small pegs.

1806
02:05:34,917 --> 02:05:37,501
Doctors say it’s good for the heart no?

1807
02:05:38,626 --> 02:05:40,167
Did you give him his
medicines last night?

1808
02:05:41,417 --> 02:05:44,292
You don't take the medicines
that doctors prescribe...

1809
02:05:44,334 --> 02:05:46,042
...but you will drink
using the doctors name.

1810
02:05:46,126 --> 02:05:47,167
Actually, you see...

1811
02:05:47,251 --> 02:05:48,709
What is this Mr. Nageshwar Rao?

1812
02:05:48,792 --> 02:05:51,292
I sent Uncle with you thinking
you will take good care of him.

1813
02:05:51,376 --> 02:05:52,667
But you're behaving so irresponsibly.

1814
02:05:52,751 --> 02:05:54,126
It’s not his fault at all.

1815
02:05:55,376 --> 02:05:56,417
Okay. It is not his fault. But...

1816
02:05:57,292 --> 02:05:58,376
Why did you drink?

1817
02:06:02,292 --> 02:06:05,209
It’s all because of him.
He is the one to blame. Get up, you.

1818
02:06:07,292 --> 02:06:08,542
Who hit me?

1819
02:06:08,626 --> 02:06:10,959
You're able to feel
someone hitting you is it?

1820
02:06:11,042 --> 02:06:13,959
God. The old man has
started early in the morning.

1821
02:06:18,376 --> 02:06:22,251
What is this Bittu?

1822
02:06:22,334 --> 02:06:27,042
T-shirt, jeans.
If you got ready so early...

1823
02:06:27,126 --> 02:06:29,126
...then it’s definitely for some girl.

1824
02:06:36,334 --> 02:06:38,334
Hello, good morning.

1825
02:06:38,917 --> 02:06:40,959
I am Nagarjuna.
- Anjali.

1826
02:06:41,042 --> 02:06:46,376
I don't think he has sobered down yet.
Go wash your face.

1827
02:06:46,459 --> 02:06:50,001
Oh God. I didn't sleep
next to you out of any love.

1828
02:06:50,084 --> 02:06:54,001
I got drunk and fell next to you, that's
all. Old man is getting flattered.

1829
02:06:55,209 --> 02:07:01,042
Bittu, your clothes, this changeover,
all for this girl, right?

1830
02:07:02,167 --> 02:07:04,417
What do you think of her?

1831
02:07:04,501 --> 02:07:07,959
Perfect match.
But is everything ok from her side too?

1832
02:07:08,459 --> 02:07:09,542
Who knows?

1833
02:07:09,626 --> 02:07:11,376
Bittu, in this generation...

1834
02:07:11,417 --> 02:07:13,417
...for chemistry to happen,
there must be some physics involved.

1835
02:07:13,501 --> 02:07:15,376
By physics I mean,
you know, some physical contact.

1836
02:07:15,417 --> 02:07:18,417
Like salsa. Arrange for a dance class.

1837
02:07:18,501 --> 02:07:21,959
The chemistry will happen automatically.
After that, she will be all yours.

1838
02:07:22,042 --> 02:07:24,167
Now let me go in and chat with her.

1839
02:07:24,376 --> 02:07:26,126
Okay, okay, okay.
- You don't worry.

1840
02:07:26,209 --> 02:07:27,667
Doctor.

1841
02:07:30,501 --> 02:07:35,251
You have given me such good
idea to get mom and you together.

1842
02:07:35,542 --> 02:07:37,292
Mom also loves to dance.

1843
02:07:38,042 --> 02:07:40,209
Just watch the fun now.

1844
02:07:49,084 --> 02:07:50,334
Priya.

1845
02:07:51,709 --> 02:07:53,459
What happened? Why are you crying?

1846
02:07:53,542 --> 02:07:54,876
I am not crying.

1847
02:07:55,292 --> 02:07:56,917
Come, let’s go shopping for dance class.

1848
02:07:57,251 --> 02:07:58,251
What dance?

1849
02:07:58,501 --> 02:08:02,876
Our college is conducting a program
on valentine’s day for the first time.

1850
02:08:02,959 --> 02:08:07,417
Both of us have been selected for it.
From tomorrow, two weeks full salsa.

1851
02:08:09,167 --> 02:08:10,501
Come on.
- Lets go.

1852
02:08:14,167 --> 02:08:16,667
If this was for routine dancing,
I wouldn't have come.

1853
02:08:16,751 --> 02:08:20,126
This is salsa.
We can actually get to touch a girl.

1854
02:08:20,209 --> 02:08:20,876
That’s why I came.

1855
02:08:20,959 --> 02:08:23,876
This is a college arranged dance event.

1856
02:08:23,917 --> 02:08:24,876
There won’t only be anyone worth it here.

1857
02:08:24,959 --> 02:08:27,417
By accident if a
good-looking one comes along.

1858
02:08:27,501 --> 02:08:29,251
All the guys will be after her.

1859
02:08:29,334 --> 02:08:31,626
This is only an official
way to cut classes.

1860
02:08:31,709 --> 02:08:33,542
Thank you.
- You have unrealistic expectations.

1861
02:08:33,626 --> 02:08:34,709
One can keep hoping dude.

1862
02:08:35,042 --> 02:08:36,959
He didn't look all that docile.

1863
02:08:37,042 --> 02:08:39,042
He was profusely sweating.

1864
02:08:40,292 --> 02:08:41,876
I am sure he was...

1865
02:09:14,292 --> 02:09:16,417
Hello. Excuse me.

1866
02:09:28,209 --> 02:09:30,709
Don't, Radha. Stay away from me.

1867
02:09:31,126 --> 02:09:33,001
I don't want anything between us again.

1868
02:09:33,334 --> 02:09:34,626
Radha?

1869
02:09:34,709 --> 02:09:36,959
What Radha? Why Radha? Who Radha?

1870
02:09:37,334 --> 02:09:39,834
I am Nagarjuna. You can call me Nag.

1871
02:09:41,084 --> 02:09:42,042
Why did you call me?

1872
02:09:42,292 --> 02:09:43,792
My kerchief.

1873
02:09:45,584 --> 02:09:46,876
Thank you.

1874
02:09:47,792 --> 02:09:50,542
Sorry.
- Hello, hello, hello madam.

1875
02:09:56,167 --> 02:09:58,417
"Come on!
Get on the dance floor!"

1876
02:10:00,501 --> 02:10:03,626
My name is Leonardo Di Caprio!

1877
02:10:04,376 --> 02:10:08,709
You all know why you are here.
So I won’t waste too much of your time.

1878
02:10:08,792 --> 02:10:10,251
Really? Promise?

1879
02:10:10,334 --> 02:10:12,167
100 percent.
- Very good, very good. Keep it up.

1880
02:10:12,459 --> 02:10:14,001
Dance is an art.

1881
02:10:14,876 --> 02:10:17,584
And when it comes to salsa,
you all have to be in the mood.

1882
02:10:17,667 --> 02:10:19,251
And for you to be in the mood...
- Hi.

1883
02:10:19,292 --> 02:10:21,501
...you need a romantic partner.

1884
02:10:21,584 --> 02:10:24,709
Only then can you do justice to salsa.
- Hi.

1885
02:10:25,667 --> 02:10:31,709
In dance there must be passion,
compassion, romance and chemistry.

1886
02:10:32,417 --> 02:10:35,251
Okay, now we shall start the pairing.

1887
02:10:39,292 --> 02:10:40,001
Nagarjuna?

1888
02:10:40,084 --> 02:10:41,834
Me.
- Good looking. Come.

1889
02:10:42,709 --> 02:10:44,626
Sir, how are you?

1890
02:10:44,709 --> 02:10:47,292
Yeah good, good. Now let’s call the lady.
Yes let’s call her.

1891
02:10:48,501 --> 02:10:50,626
Please. Please.
- I think it’s her. Hey Priya.

1892
02:10:51,917 --> 02:10:52,751
Priya.

1893
02:10:53,459 --> 02:10:55,709
Cute, isn't she? Come, come.

1894
02:10:57,251 --> 02:11:00,126
Sir, thank you sir, thank you sir. She's
perfect for you. Yes perfect for me sir.

1895
02:11:00,209 --> 02:11:01,626
Happy sir, very happy sir.
- You're happy right?

1896
02:11:01,667 --> 02:11:03,167
You're happy, I'm happy.
- Thank you sir.

1897
02:11:04,459 --> 02:11:07,792
Now look here. I want the chemistry
between you two be of cosmic levels.

1898
02:11:07,876 --> 02:11:09,001
There should be love.
- Okay, sir.

1899
02:11:09,084 --> 02:11:10,834
Okay sir.
- There should be affection.

1900
02:11:11,084 --> 02:11:12,542
Now what about me?

1901
02:11:12,751 --> 02:11:13,959
Master, I have a question.
- Yes.

1902
02:11:14,209 --> 02:11:15,542
Please set something for me too please.

1903
02:11:15,626 --> 02:11:17,417
Am I a broker to set something for you?

1904
02:11:17,459 --> 02:11:19,209
I will kick you.
Find someone for yourself.

1905
02:11:19,292 --> 02:11:20,084
Come on guys.

1906
02:11:20,167 --> 02:11:21,501
All of you choose your pairs.
- Where are you my dear?

1907
02:11:21,584 --> 02:11:22,959
Yeah. Good, good.

1908
02:11:24,834 --> 02:11:26,334
Of course you must.
- No problem, sir.

1909
02:11:26,417 --> 02:11:27,876
Hold her waist there's no problem.
- Thank you, sir.

1910
02:11:27,959 --> 02:11:32,167
You remember Priya?
I want chemistry between you. Music.

1911
02:11:38,251 --> 02:11:40,126
Nagarjuna, hold her properly.

1912
02:11:41,751 --> 02:11:42,834
Cut, cut, cut.

1913
02:11:43,667 --> 02:11:45,001
What happened?

1914
02:11:45,084 --> 02:11:46,667
What happened? Nothing is happening.

1915
02:11:46,751 --> 02:11:48,376
What did you say?
That you wanted romance, right?

1916
02:11:48,459 --> 02:11:49,001
Definitely.

1917
02:11:49,084 --> 02:11:50,959
Without eye contact

1918
02:11:51,042 --> 02:11:52,084
It will never come.

1919
02:11:52,167 --> 02:11:53,709
She is not looking.
- What?

1920
02:11:53,792 --> 02:11:54,667
Eye contact.

1921
02:11:54,751 --> 02:11:57,959
Eye contact. What happened?
Do you have a problem with your eyes?

1922
02:11:58,042 --> 02:11:59,001
I am looking, sir.

1923
02:11:59,084 --> 02:12:00,292
I don't see that happening.

1924
02:12:00,376 --> 02:12:04,501
When you look at him,
you must floor him with your eyes.

1925
02:12:04,917 --> 02:12:06,584
Only then will romance come.

1926
02:12:06,917 --> 02:12:08,042
Have you understood?

1927
02:12:08,334 --> 02:12:09,126
Nagarjuna look at her.

1928
02:12:10,209 --> 02:12:13,751
Is it coming? Has it come?
- Yes master it's coming.

1929
02:12:13,959 --> 02:12:16,876
Start music master. It’s coming master.
- Don't be shy. Hold her. Very good.

1930
02:12:16,959 --> 02:12:17,876
Music.

1931
02:12:24,084 --> 02:12:24,834
Yes.

1932
02:12:26,917 --> 02:12:27,876
Cut, cut, cut, cut.

1933
02:12:28,501 --> 02:12:29,667
What happened now?

1934
02:12:30,167 --> 02:12:31,084
What is the problem?

1935
02:12:31,292 --> 02:12:33,084
What is this master? How will
there be romance without a smile?

1936
02:12:33,251 --> 02:12:34,209
She isn't smiling?

1937
02:12:34,376 --> 02:12:36,751
Why should I smile? I am dancing right?

1938
02:12:37,751 --> 02:12:42,834
Oh Prabhu Deva. To dance gracefully,
you should smile, my dear.

1939
02:12:43,084 --> 02:12:45,334
Dance with a smile, there is no problem.

1940
02:12:48,876 --> 02:12:52,667
Not like that.
Smile properly. Smile wide.

1941
02:12:52,751 --> 02:12:55,459
I am smiling.
- Yes good. She is smiling Nagarjuna.

1942
02:12:55,542 --> 02:12:56,626
She is smiling master,
yes she is smiling.

1943
02:12:56,709 --> 02:12:58,251
Romance is coming master.

1944
02:12:58,334 --> 02:13:00,334
Start music. Start, start, start.

1945
02:13:00,417 --> 02:13:01,334
All the best Nagarjuna.

1946
02:13:01,417 --> 02:13:02,667
Start the music.
- I am able to feel the romance now.

1947
02:13:25,834 --> 02:13:27,376
The guy at the counter took a long time.

1948
02:13:27,584 --> 02:13:29,251
That is why I made
special coffee for you.

1949
02:13:29,334 --> 02:13:32,417
I realized that if you like
someone we can do anything for them.

1950
02:13:35,542 --> 02:13:36,376
Excuse me.

1951
02:13:36,459 --> 02:13:38,376
Don't touch my phone.
Don't you dare touch my phone.

1952
02:13:38,459 --> 02:13:39,709
Wait, wait, wait.

1953
02:13:40,001 --> 02:13:41,751
Why are you staring at it shamelessly?

1954
02:13:45,792 --> 02:13:48,167
To even sit here, don't you have any.
- Clock tower signal.

1955
02:13:49,834 --> 02:13:51,167
There is a tree opposite it.

1956
02:13:52,084 --> 02:13:54,834
Time around 10:20.

1957
02:13:55,542 --> 02:13:58,834
Maybe 30-31 days back.

1958
02:14:00,042 --> 02:14:01,042
Look here.

1959
02:14:08,542 --> 02:14:11,876
Unbelievable. This is destiny.

1960
02:14:12,251 --> 02:14:15,042
This is fate. It brings people
together even if they don't want it to.

1961
02:14:15,876 --> 02:14:17,834
What nonsense.
This isn't destiny or fate.

1962
02:14:17,917 --> 02:14:19,584
Don't you understand
the concept of coincidence?

1963
02:14:19,792 --> 02:14:23,376
Some things just happen
for no reason at all. Stupid.

1964
02:14:25,876 --> 02:14:29,417
Ladies first,
ladies first, Ladies always have to be.

1965
02:14:31,542 --> 02:14:33,584
No call yet.

1966
02:14:33,876 --> 02:14:37,376
Dance class would've gotten done by now.
It's 5:30. Call me.

1967
02:14:39,626 --> 02:14:40,876
It is dad!

1968
02:14:41,917 --> 02:14:44,001
Hello.
- I am finished Bittu.

1969
02:14:44,209 --> 02:14:44,917
What happened?

1970
02:14:45,001 --> 02:14:47,251
I've come for a dance
class from college Bittu.

1971
02:14:47,334 --> 02:14:49,334
You should see my partner.
- Bye.

1972
02:14:49,417 --> 02:14:53,292
You have to see her to believe it.

1973
02:14:53,376 --> 02:14:54,584
What's her name?

1974
02:14:54,667 --> 02:14:56,209
Priya, Bittu. Priya.

1975
02:14:57,042 --> 02:14:59,084
I haven't seen such a beautiful girl.

1976
02:14:59,167 --> 02:15:03,834
But Bittu, you should have seen how
much I tried to get her to smile today.

1977
02:15:03,917 --> 02:15:05,251
Everything blew up in my face.

1978
02:15:05,334 --> 02:15:06,501
What happened? Why?

1979
02:15:06,834 --> 02:15:10,667
Who knows Bittu? Fate, destiny...

1980
02:15:10,751 --> 02:15:12,251
Move that's my car.
- ...phosphate, sulphate.

1981
02:15:12,751 --> 02:15:13,542
That's my car.
- Hello.

1982
02:15:13,626 --> 02:15:15,209
What? Who are you talking to?

1983
02:15:15,292 --> 02:15:19,667
Yeah that's what Bittu. In the potassium
permanganate and sodium nitrate in the.

1984
02:15:19,751 --> 02:15:22,126
What are you saying? You are saying
something about potassium permanganate?

1985
02:15:22,209 --> 02:15:24,417
Come on!
- I don't understand what you say.

1986
02:15:24,501 --> 02:15:27,292
In the potassium permanganate and
sodium nitrate..

1987
02:15:27,376 --> 02:15:28,834
When sulfur dioxide mixes with.

1988
02:15:28,917 --> 02:15:30,417
I don't understand what you are saying.

1989
02:15:30,501 --> 02:15:33,209
My chemistry just
physically went away now.

1990
02:15:33,292 --> 02:15:35,626
I will come home and
tell you everything okay? Bye.

1991
02:15:35,709 --> 02:15:37,292
Okay, bye.

1992
02:15:38,709 --> 02:15:39,501
Mom.

1993
02:15:41,792 --> 02:15:44,709
As you asked, Priya is going for the
dance class from today.

1994
02:15:44,792 --> 02:15:45,501
Thank you mother.

1995
02:15:46,626 --> 02:15:51,626
Ma? Ma. Why didn't you call me? I've
been waiting for your call for so long.

1996
02:15:52,167 --> 02:15:53,084
Bittu.

1997
02:15:54,251 --> 02:15:55,459
I was just thinking about you.

1998
02:15:56,209 --> 02:15:57,209
Sit, sit.

1999
02:15:58,542 --> 02:15:59,584
How was your day?

2000
02:15:59,667 --> 02:16:01,834
Forget about my day.
Tell me about yours.

2001
02:16:02,126 --> 02:16:03,876
Did you do anything new today?

2002
02:16:04,292 --> 02:16:07,209
Oh yes I just remembered.

2003
02:16:08,126 --> 02:16:09,834
I am going for a dance class from today.

2004
02:16:10,209 --> 02:16:12,167
Oh wow dance class.

2005
02:16:12,417 --> 02:16:16,501
Did you meet somebody interesting?
New dance partner?

2006
02:16:19,042 --> 02:16:19,751
Useless Bittu.

2007
02:16:19,834 --> 02:16:21,459
Is there a problem
with your dance partner?

2008
02:16:21,667 --> 02:16:23,917
I don't even remember
that dance partners face.

2009
02:16:24,126 --> 02:16:26,584
You don't even remember his face?

2010
02:16:29,251 --> 02:16:32,417
From now on you will remember
every minute. Just one minute.

2011
02:16:34,334 --> 02:16:39,209
That stupid dance master.
Idiot. Leonardo.

2012
02:16:55,459 --> 02:16:57,167
Hey, come fast.
- What happened?

2013
02:16:57,251 --> 02:16:58,917
Class would have started.
- Oh okay.

2014
02:17:05,834 --> 02:17:07,251
What happened? Why did you stop?

2015
02:17:07,584 --> 02:17:08,251
Nothing. Let’s go.

2016
02:17:10,459 --> 02:17:12,084
Hi, girls. How's my landing?

2017
02:17:12,376 --> 02:17:13,459
Why did you come down like that?

2018
02:17:13,542 --> 02:17:14,792
The lift wasn't working.

2019
02:17:15,376 --> 02:17:16,792
There isn't a lift here at all.

2020
02:17:16,876 --> 02:17:19,542
No lift, lift not working,
isn't it all the same?

2021
02:17:19,626 --> 02:17:22,084
Judging by your behavior yesterday,
I thought you wouldn't come today.

2022
02:17:22,167 --> 02:17:23,334
I also thought of leaving.

2023
02:17:23,417 --> 02:17:26,709
But you gave a signal from your car,
right? I heard that and stayed behind.

2024
02:17:27,084 --> 02:17:29,876
Car sound signal. For you?

2025
02:17:29,959 --> 02:17:30,792
Yes, yes.

2026
02:17:31,001 --> 02:17:31,792
Get a life.

2027
02:17:32,417 --> 02:17:35,251
Good morning bloody nasty students.

2028
02:17:35,584 --> 02:17:41,667
I was shouted at by the high command
for the lack of romance between you all.

2029
02:17:42,417 --> 02:17:45,917
So we are going to
increase the dosage today.

2030
02:17:50,001 --> 02:17:53,542
Today we are going
to introduce a new step.

2031
02:17:54,042 --> 02:17:54,834
What is that?

2032
02:17:55,126 --> 02:17:57,167
How do I explain?

2033
02:17:57,376 --> 02:18:03,251
What I mean is that today when
you dance, your hearts must become one.

2034
02:18:03,334 --> 02:18:04,709
Okay sir. Okay sir.

2035
02:18:04,792 --> 02:18:07,042
It should be very strong
you see performance.

2036
02:18:07,126 --> 02:18:08,376
Performance.
- That's performance.

2037
02:18:08,459 --> 02:18:09,376
Yeah, yeah.
- Performance.

2038
02:18:09,626 --> 02:18:11,001
Strong? Alright.

2039
02:18:12,292 --> 02:18:14,084
Alright. Will give a strong one.
- Okay so sweet.

2040
02:18:14,167 --> 02:18:15,709
Okay Nagarjuna,
she said she would give it.

2041
02:18:15,792 --> 02:18:16,917
You take it.
- Sure sir.

2042
02:18:31,709 --> 02:18:33,292
Oh God!

2043
02:18:42,167 --> 02:18:43,292
Oh no!

2044
02:18:50,917 --> 02:18:54,459
I'm so happy.
A communication has started between us.

2045
02:18:54,542 --> 02:18:57,667
Of course, it’s not a must that
you have to react as sweetly as me...

2046
02:18:57,751 --> 02:18:59,376
...but as long as you react,
it’s all good.

2047
02:18:59,417 --> 02:19:01,876
Hey listen.
What exactly is your problem?

2048
02:19:02,042 --> 02:19:03,542
You come to me, talk nonsense.

2049
02:19:03,626 --> 02:19:06,001
I get angry just
listening to your voice.

2050
02:19:39,334 --> 02:19:40,334
I love you.

2051
02:19:41,751 --> 02:19:42,751
What is this?

2052
02:19:42,959 --> 02:19:44,001
You asked me to give this to you right?

2053
02:19:44,376 --> 02:19:45,001
What?

2054
02:19:45,292 --> 02:19:46,417
You asked for this didn't you?

2055
02:19:47,126 --> 02:19:47,751
Not this?

2056
02:19:49,167 --> 02:19:49,792
This?

2057
02:19:50,334 --> 02:19:52,334
You heard it that way?

2058
02:19:53,709 --> 02:19:55,209
Give me that.

2059
02:19:56,876 --> 02:19:58,751
Who is your gardener?

2060
02:19:58,834 --> 02:20:00,876
Ask him to talk to me.
- Sure.

2061
02:20:00,959 --> 02:20:03,584
He isn't taking care of them well.
They should be treated like children.

2062
02:20:08,584 --> 02:20:09,792
Why are you staring at me?

2063
02:20:10,417 --> 02:20:13,292
Are you wondering
why I'm looking at them?

2064
02:20:13,376 --> 02:20:15,167
You want me to tell
them the truth right?

2065
02:20:15,251 --> 02:20:20,292
Parents can bear any
pain for their children...

2066
02:20:20,376 --> 02:20:22,876
...but knowing that their child has
little time to live, will break them.

2067
02:20:24,584 --> 02:20:31,542
If desire is strong enough,
I believe that my wish will come true.

2068
02:20:32,501 --> 02:20:41,209
My desire now is only
that I be born again to them.

2069
02:20:50,709 --> 02:20:53,376
Why hasn't she come yet?

2070
02:20:57,376 --> 02:20:59,459
Your partner hasn't come?
Is that why you are not dancing?

2071
02:20:59,542 --> 02:21:01,584
Don't worry. She will come. Okay.

2072
02:21:32,917 --> 02:21:34,126
Girish Karnad. Sir.

2073
02:21:34,292 --> 02:21:35,417
Tomorrow is my birthday.
You know that don't you?

2074
02:21:35,501 --> 02:21:36,876
I know Sir. Feb 13.

2075
02:21:36,959 --> 02:21:38,459
I want you to arrange a grand party.

2076
02:21:38,542 --> 02:21:39,667
How come Sir?

2077
02:21:39,751 --> 02:21:42,126
You normally never
celebrate your birthday...

2078
02:21:42,209 --> 02:21:43,542
...because your parents
passed away the next day.

2079
02:21:43,709 --> 02:21:45,667
I'm telling you. Arrange a party.

2080
02:21:45,751 --> 02:21:46,459
Okay sir.

2081
02:21:46,542 --> 02:21:50,334
There are two important
guests whom I will invite myself.

2082
02:21:50,417 --> 02:21:51,584
I will arrange everything Sir.

2083
02:21:51,667 --> 02:21:52,584
Right.

2084
02:21:53,709 --> 02:21:55,667
I've done everything you asked.

2085
02:21:55,751 --> 02:21:56,501
Priya?

2086
02:21:56,667 --> 02:21:59,042
Leave Priya to me.
Getting her there is my responsibility.

2087
02:21:59,126 --> 02:22:03,334
Thank you so much Bittu. You
are the best friend in the whole world.

2088
02:22:08,792 --> 02:22:09,334
Hello.
- Hi, sir.

2089
02:22:09,417 --> 02:22:10,292
How are you?
- Greeting, sir.

2090
02:22:10,376 --> 02:22:11,626
Thank you for coming.

2091
02:22:24,209 --> 02:22:25,167
Uncle?

2092
02:22:27,251 --> 02:22:30,001
What a fantastic car. What's this Uncle?

2093
02:22:30,084 --> 02:22:32,251
A small gift from me to you.

2094
02:22:32,334 --> 02:22:34,251
You being with me itself is a huge gift.

2095
02:22:34,292 --> 02:22:35,084
Please.

2096
02:22:35,292 --> 02:22:36,126
It will make me happy.

2097
02:22:36,584 --> 02:22:38,876
This is a gift I cannot refuse.

2098
02:22:39,251 --> 02:22:42,126
I love this car.
I love you, Uncle. I love you.

2099
02:23:11,709 --> 02:23:13,626
I thought you wouldn't come.

2100
02:23:14,251 --> 02:23:16,001
Why would you think
that I wouldn't come?

2101
02:23:16,292 --> 02:23:18,917
you're a bit late.
I assumed you wouldn't come.

2102
02:23:21,167 --> 02:23:24,167
Tell me. How do I look?

2103
02:23:41,334 --> 02:23:42,251
What is this?

2104
02:23:42,667 --> 02:23:43,417
Gift.

2105
02:23:44,501 --> 02:23:45,542
Traditional clothes.

2106
02:23:46,292 --> 02:23:47,626
I really liked them.

2107
02:23:47,917 --> 02:23:49,292
They will look good on you.

2108
02:23:50,167 --> 02:23:51,334
Don't laugh okay?

2109
02:23:53,626 --> 02:23:54,334
Give it here.

2110
02:23:58,834 --> 02:24:03,667
I've been waiting so
long to hear you say that.

2111
02:24:06,959 --> 02:24:08,084
I love you too.

2112
02:24:11,417 --> 02:24:12,626
I love you three.

2113
02:24:13,834 --> 02:24:17,417
I love you four. I love you five.

2114
02:24:37,584 --> 02:24:38,584
That's the car sir
gave instructions about.

2115
02:24:38,667 --> 02:24:39,709
I will go inform him.
- Okay.

2116
02:24:42,417 --> 02:24:43,167
Good evening, Madam.

2117
02:24:43,251 --> 02:24:44,667
Sir is waiting for you inside.

2118
02:24:44,751 --> 02:24:45,584
Okay.
- This way.

2119
02:24:45,667 --> 02:24:47,501
Alright. Go in that way.
- Sure, ma'am!

2120
02:26:04,084 --> 02:26:05,542
I love you Krishna.

2121
02:26:08,126 --> 02:26:10,251
If I had another second
of life left in me then...

2122
02:26:10,334 --> 02:26:11,959
...those would've been
my last words to you.

2123
02:26:12,751 --> 02:26:14,042
The first time I saw you in this life...

2124
02:26:14,126 --> 02:26:15,667
...they should have been
my first words to you.

2125
02:26:16,751 --> 02:26:18,667
Then, I didn't know that
I had to tell you, and so I didn't.

2126
02:26:19,626 --> 02:26:21,417
Now even though
I want to tell you so badly...

2127
02:26:21,501 --> 02:26:22,917
...the situation never presented itself.

2128
02:26:25,042 --> 02:26:28,709
Not today. I remembered
our past on that day itself.

2129
02:26:30,334 --> 02:26:33,709
That night the thunder woke me up.
I saw you next to Bittu.

2130
02:26:34,084 --> 02:26:41,417
Instantly I knew I had met you before.
I slowly got reminded of us, our past.

2131
02:26:53,292 --> 02:26:54,792
I remembered everything Krishna.

2132
02:26:54,959 --> 02:27:00,709
How much you loved me, how much
I made you suffer, I remember all of it.

2133
02:27:02,126 --> 02:27:03,959
I wanted us,
who left Bittu and went away.

2134
02:27:05,292 --> 02:27:07,876
To go back to him
as his mother and father.

2135
02:27:09,876 --> 02:27:14,667
But that night, it became clear to
me that you could not stand me Krishna.

2136
02:27:20,084 --> 02:27:22,542
In that life we had an
arranged marriage, Krishna.

2137
02:27:22,751 --> 02:27:24,251
You came into my life without
any effort from my part...

2138
02:27:24,334 --> 02:27:26,251
...I didn't realize your worth.

2139
02:27:26,334 --> 02:27:28,251
Even so, I never betrayed you.

2140
02:27:28,459 --> 02:27:29,917
I never cheated on you.

2141
02:27:30,917 --> 02:27:33,626
Leave aside love that
lasts across births.

2142
02:27:33,709 --> 02:27:36,042
Was your hate for me in
our past life all that lasted?

2143
02:27:36,292 --> 02:27:39,001
They say that if there is love,
even sins are forgiven.

2144
02:27:39,792 --> 02:27:43,709
For a mistake I never committed,
do I deserve this punishment Krishna?

2145
02:27:44,001 --> 02:27:48,834
I am not asking you to love me now.
Scold me, hit me, fight with me.

2146
02:27:50,042 --> 02:27:51,626
But don't distance me from you.

2147
02:27:54,167 --> 02:27:58,167
I am telling you this out of fear
that we may not get this chance again.

2148
02:28:00,459 --> 02:28:04,584
Without you,
death is far better than life Krishna.

2149
02:29:00,751 --> 02:29:02,042
Punditji, Good morning.

2150
02:29:02,126 --> 02:29:03,792
Sir, today is your parents
death anniversary...

2151
02:29:03,876 --> 02:29:05,209
...so if you tell me when
you're coming for the ceremony...

2152
02:29:05,292 --> 02:29:05,917
...I can make the arrangements...

2153
02:29:06,001 --> 02:29:08,542
Sharmaji, Sharmaji. There wont
be any need for that from now on.

2154
02:29:08,626 --> 02:29:10,334
What do you mean sir?

2155
02:29:10,376 --> 02:29:13,334
I mean that there is no need anymore.
Good day.

2156
02:29:51,959 --> 02:29:53,167
Lakshmi!

2157
02:29:57,792 --> 02:29:58,917
Uncle.

2158
02:29:59,709 --> 02:30:00,959
102 degrees.

2159
02:30:02,209 --> 02:30:04,251
This is the effect of last night’s party.

2160
02:30:04,334 --> 02:30:07,417
You have to stay on bed all day today.
Complete rest. Alright?

2161
02:30:12,709 --> 02:30:13,459
Anjali.

2162
02:30:15,001 --> 02:30:17,042
Uncle, I will be right back.

2163
02:30:19,209 --> 02:30:22,334
They've gone out. There's an oil leak.

2164
02:30:22,417 --> 02:30:25,959
The brakes will fail again. Everything
is happening just like before.

2165
02:30:26,959 --> 02:30:29,542
I've been trying. Their lines are gone.

2166
02:30:29,626 --> 02:30:30,751
Where have they gone?

2167
02:30:30,834 --> 02:30:33,209
Lakshmi said that they have
gone to the Srinivasa temple.

2168
02:30:33,292 --> 02:30:36,084
Don't worry. Nothing will
happen to them. Come, let’s go.

2169
02:30:57,959 --> 02:30:59,501
Buddy, stop it!

2170
02:31:00,251 --> 02:31:01,709
Buddy, shut up!
- No! Buddy!

2171
02:31:03,626 --> 02:31:05,459
Security. Come and take him away.
- Sir.

2172
02:31:05,542 --> 02:31:07,459
Come soon. Go on. Move it.
- Okay, sir.

2173
02:31:08,042 --> 02:31:09,626
Anjali come. Come soon.
- Okay.

2174
02:31:29,251 --> 02:31:31,876
Lakshmi, Lakshmi.
- Coming.

2175
02:31:31,959 --> 02:31:33,167
Where have they gone?

2176
02:31:33,251 --> 02:31:34,667
They've gone to the Srinivasa temple.

2177
02:31:39,001 --> 02:31:45,626
Please stop. Auto. Please stop.

2178
02:31:45,709 --> 02:31:47,167
My family has gone ahead in a car.

2179
02:31:47,251 --> 02:31:50,751
The brakes aren't working. They
are in danger. Will you help me please?

2180
02:31:56,709 --> 02:32:02,126
Priya. No, Krishna.
Should I call you Krishna or Priya?

2181
02:32:02,209 --> 02:32:03,001
Call me Priya.

2182
02:32:03,084 --> 02:32:04,501
Okay, Priya.

2183
02:32:04,709 --> 02:32:06,917
Yes, Mr. Nagarjuna.

2184
02:33:21,917 --> 02:33:24,084
ACCIDENT PRONE ZONE

2185
02:33:46,167 --> 02:33:47,709
See! They are there!

2186
02:33:52,876 --> 02:33:54,834
Priya, Priya wear your seatbelt.

2187
02:33:56,084 --> 02:33:57,917
The brakes are not working.

2188
02:34:01,709 --> 02:34:02,876
Bittu.
- Dad.

2189
02:34:02,959 --> 02:34:05,501
Bittu, the brakes aren't working.

2190
02:34:05,584 --> 02:34:08,376
I will do something. Hold on.
- Okay.

2191
02:34:31,376 --> 02:34:33,667
Mom! Mom!

2192
02:34:34,001 --> 02:34:35,084
Are you okay?

2193
02:34:36,251 --> 02:34:37,334
Are you okay?

2194
02:34:38,209 --> 02:34:39,251
Are you okay?

2195
02:34:39,334 --> 02:34:41,209
Bittu! Bittu!
- Dad!

2196
02:34:41,292 --> 02:34:42,876
Thank you so much, Bittu.

2197
02:34:42,959 --> 02:34:43,876
You have come at the right moment!
- Dad!

2198
02:34:43,959 --> 02:34:45,626
Are you okay?
- Okay, Bittu. Yeah.

2199
02:34:46,251 --> 02:34:47,251
Thank you, Bittu.

2200
02:34:51,792 --> 02:34:52,959
I can't believe this.

2201
02:35:23,917 --> 02:35:25,251
My God!
- You guys are okay?

2202
02:35:27,459 --> 02:35:28,584
Uncle.
- Uncle.

2203
02:35:28,667 --> 02:35:30,126
Oh no. Uncle.
- Uncle.

2204
02:35:30,334 --> 02:35:31,501
Uncle. Uncle.
- Are you okay?

2205
02:35:31,584 --> 02:35:32,626
Uncle. Uncle.

2206
02:35:32,709 --> 02:35:34,167
Uncle. Are you okay?

2207
02:35:35,167 --> 02:35:36,542
Thank you so much Uncle.

2208
02:35:36,626 --> 02:35:37,542
You came at the right time.

2209
02:35:37,626 --> 02:35:39,542
Otherwise the lorry
would've definitely hit us.

2210
02:35:39,626 --> 02:35:41,001
Uncle, thank you so much!
- Thank you so much!

2211
02:35:41,084 --> 02:35:43,376
You saved us!
- You came at the perfect time.

2212
02:35:43,417 --> 02:35:45,001
Thank you so much uncle.
- Dear!

2213
02:35:45,084 --> 02:35:47,001
It wasn't me who saved you.

2214
02:35:47,167 --> 02:35:48,126
Really?
- What?

2215
02:35:48,459 --> 02:35:49,917
He was somewhere here, that boy.

2216
02:35:52,251 --> 02:35:53,001
Look there!

2217
02:36:17,334 --> 02:36:20,334
"Cheers for the Star."

2218
02:36:20,417 --> 02:36:23,251
"Yeah! Cheers to him."

2219
02:36:23,334 --> 02:36:26,334
"Cheers for the Star."

2220
02:36:26,417 --> 02:36:29,334
"Cheers for the Star."

2221
02:36:29,501 --> 02:36:32,376
"Hip hip hurray!"

2222
02:36:32,459 --> 02:36:35,459
"He is the man! Ah! Ah! Akhil!"

2223
02:36:35,542 --> 02:36:38,501
"He is the star! Reaches the sky."

2224
02:36:38,542 --> 02:36:41,542
"He is the star! Ah! Ah! Akhil!"

2225
02:36:51,959 --> 02:36:54,334
Granddad, you're okay, no?
- Okay.

2226
02:36:54,417 --> 02:36:56,167
What was that?

2227
02:36:56,459 --> 02:36:58,334
Hi, I am Akhil.

2228
02:37:18,584 --> 02:37:21,917
Dad!
- You are all we see!

2229
02:37:22,334 --> 02:37:26,209
You are everything!

2230
02:37:26,376 --> 02:37:28,834
You will always remain in
our (Telugu people) memories.

2231
02:38:09,042 --> 02:38:15,251
"I've become the mother
to my mom who gave birth to me."

2232
02:38:15,584 --> 02:38:21,792
"I've become the father to my dad who
taught me how to take my first steps."

2233
02:38:22,459 --> 02:38:24,001
"One is my sight."

2234
02:38:24,084 --> 02:38:25,667
"The other my eyes."

2235
02:38:25,751 --> 02:38:28,917
"Both together make my life beautiful."

2236
02:38:29,001 --> 02:38:30,501
"One is the feeling."

2237
02:38:30,584 --> 02:38:32,084
"The other is the thought."

2238
02:38:32,167 --> 02:38:34,959
"Both together, make my world turn."

2239
02:38:35,042 --> 02:38:36,167
"They fill my life with love."

2240
02:38:36,251 --> 02:38:37,376
"Love."

2241
02:38:38,209 --> 02:38:41,417
"Love is back."

2242
02:38:41,501 --> 02:38:44,376
"This is love."

2243
02:38:44,709 --> 02:38:47,917
"I only see love."

2244
02:38:48,001 --> 02:38:54,876
"These moments filled
with love are drowning me."

2245
02:39:32,126 --> 02:39:37,792
"I'm becoming the teacher to
the mother who taught me to write."

2246
02:39:38,667 --> 02:39:44,084
"I'm becoming the path to
the father who taught me my steps."

2247
02:39:45,167 --> 02:39:47,959
"As I watch them be playful."

2248
02:39:48,042 --> 02:39:51,459
"Joy is back. Watching them grow."

2249
02:39:51,667 --> 02:39:54,417
"Becoming the child again with them."

2250
02:39:54,459 --> 02:39:58,126
"The story in my dreams is coming true."

2251
02:39:58,167 --> 02:40:00,917
"This is love."

2252
02:40:01,001 --> 02:40:04,167
"I only see love."

2253
02:40:04,251 --> 02:40:07,292
"This is love."

2254
02:40:07,376 --> 02:40:10,626
"They fill my life with love."

2255
02:40:10,667 --> 02:40:16,792
"These moments filled
with love are drowning me."

2256
02:40:30,542 --> 02:40:36,001
"The hand feeding me
is the hand of an angel."

2257
02:40:37,042 --> 02:40:42,876
"That angel wiping my tears away
is the one who needs to be worshipped."

2258
02:40:43,459 --> 02:40:49,626
"How can I forget the many
bedtime stories read to me."

2259
02:40:50,042 --> 02:40:52,876
"The sways in my cradle."

2260
02:40:52,917 --> 02:40:56,084
"Have today become
the beats of my heart."

2261
02:40:56,126 --> 02:40:59,292
"This is love."

2262
02:40:59,376 --> 02:41:02,542
"I only see love."

2263
02:41:02,584 --> 02:41:05,667
"This is love."

2264
02:41:05,709 --> 02:41:08,917
"They fill my life with love."

2265
02:41:09,001 --> 02:41:15,126
"These moments filled
with love are drowning me."
