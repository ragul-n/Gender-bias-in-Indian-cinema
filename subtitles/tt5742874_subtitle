They say I wear holy
heads around my wrist.

32
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:32,007
I shouldn't be speaking my language.

33
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:34,043
But

34
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:39,242
Don't forget that if I
have the holy heads on one hand"

They do not like it.

43
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:06,999
Because this isn't my angel.

44
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,703

47
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:17,411
It has happened so in the
past that whenever a system fails

...it gives rise to a massive
and angry power of opposition.

When I do that, they defame me.

00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:33,436
They call rue a tyrant

55
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:35,530
They call rue a dictator.

86
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,692
His name is Gandhi, Satkat.

87
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:17,003
I believe that the project
he is approaching you.

88
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:21,468
He very good fol Maharashtra,
especially Mumbai.

89
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:25,708
Who is this Gandhi?

90
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:30,417
As per my knowledge, he is
backed by influential businessmen.

91
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:35,581
He has
done big projects with others.

92
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,019
I have heard that he has
lots of money from the cement lobby.

93
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,524
He has the support of
many politicians as well.

94
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:43,726
He has connections

95
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:47,634
But there has to be a special
reason as he is approaching us.

96
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:12,056
I have heard that you
do what you feel is right.

97
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,653
I too am somewhat like that.

98
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:33,638
I have also heard that you
don't waste time.

99
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:38,139
You are.

100
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:51,084
I like that.

101
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:55,765
There is a place in Lavish East.

102
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:01,532
We are planning a
project of 20,000 cmle.

103
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:06,636
But for that we will have to
move 15,000 people from there.

104
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:11,613
It is not that we don't
have no other option except you.

105
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:24,525
But you
will make the job easier.

106
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:30,565
Being Satkat you have
a strong hold on them.

107
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,525
If you agree then. .

108
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:38,474
...Lhele can he some
arlangement between us.

109
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:43,071
What is the need to make
an arlangement '.7

110
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,539
If you want to move them...

111
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:51,183
...then make another place for them.

112
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:57,287
That will reduce out profits.

113
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:00,630
I am a businessman.

114
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:04,627
And I have no intention
of being a leader.

115
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:09,696
If that is what I wanted
to do then why would I approach you'?

116
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:16,001
Offer something that
benefits both of us.

117
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:27,115
I agreed to meet
you at Gokuls request.

118
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:36,655
"Because I too believe that
this is a good project for everyone.

119
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:41,568
But. .

120
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:51,474
There has to be a litnit to the price
to pay for anything however good it

121
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:55,382
...be it in cash or self respect.

. .01 even pain.

123

Pain

124
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:12,498
It will pain if you
evict them from there.

125
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:18,231
And you must pay fol
the pain you inflict.

126
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:32,351
Now that I have heard your intentions
and of those who are hacking you"

127
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:35,552
...it is time you heard my reply.

128
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:40,062
I won't do it.

129
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,764
As I said...

130
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,668
...you aren't the only
one who can do this for us.

131
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:01,711
And I won't let anyone else do it.

132
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:10,525
Okay.

133
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:15,498
I thought we can come to a n
arlangement which benefits both of us.

134
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:21,337

I can talk to my partneL.

People say that Satkat is a thought.

151
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:43,040
But I have a way
of killing thoughts too.

152
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:45,240
Call Deshpande.

00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,051
I ask the chief minister...

00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:00,993
...the government officiaJs ...

158
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:02,989

I know everything about this Satkat.

163
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,524
He pretends to be
a messiah of the pool..

164
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,425
"And behind everyone's
hack he nms his illicit business.

165
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:39,193
He ties holy beads around his wrist.

166
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:44,235
"But behind the hack
he does monkey business.

167
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,004
Satkat has only one mantra.

168
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:54,641
Pretend to be a saint.

169
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,016
"And keep gathering
other people's wealth.

This is democracy .

181

Democracy .

182
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:47,630
People should he ruling
but he has made them slaves.

183
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:49,631
We cannot allow this.

184
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:53,507
His hands are supporting
a lot of thieves.

185
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:56,408
...we need to first
get rid of that hand.

186
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:59,746
Then we will rip him apart.

187
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,953
Long live" Govind Deshpande.

Mole important
than what he is talking"

192
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,973
It's important to find out who is
making him talk.

193
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:04,439
Amrita had called.

194
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:12,113
Chickoo wants to come here.

195

AmriL. Amrita doesn't
want him to come hele.

...had to kill father

213

"That whatever you did was right.

219
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:13,028
I am happy that you didn't
believe in what 0111 enemies said.

220
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:16,591
Let the past he.

221
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:25,734
Every corner of that house
had a lot of memories of Shankal.

222
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:30,035
So We lefl that house.

223

Tell me,
what's happening in your life?

225
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:53,566
It has been so long and I
have never seen you smile.

226
00:24:56,361 --> 00:25:00,070
Perhaps I don't have
a reason to smile.

227
00:25:00,565 --> 00:25:01,976
I'm not a good enough reason?

228
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:05,275
Your plesence has
given me a lot in life.

229
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:11,220
You have been with
Satkat since one month.

230
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,114
How do you feel Lhele?

231
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:17,719

...y0u love a gill"

235
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:35,740
...whose father was killed by Salkal'?

236
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:37,343
No.

237
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:41,313
And I too haven't
mentioned to anyone.

238
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,051
How is Satkat?

239
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:47,351
He isn't as had as some
people considel him to he.

240
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:52,327
But his men, Lhele is something .

241
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:56,021
Especially with Gokul.

242
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:02,597
I don't like him.

243
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:09,570
And what is your
opinion about Deshpande?

244
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:12,081

00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:23,985
Sit, you won't understand"

248
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:29,231
. .what kind of politics
he played and ruined my career.

249
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:32,029
I just need to break
Satkat.

250
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:37,339
And I can mange fol hammers
like Gandhi to break him.

251
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:39,235
Yes, I know.

252
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:43,040
I have proposed you:
name for Radhika Mills.

253
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:48,006
The union leader is over smart.

254

He wants to keep sweets in both hands

255
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:51,610
You need to he careful.

256
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:06,162
The problem with sweets
is that they are very sweet.

257
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:07,696
I didn't get you.

258
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:15,975
If you and I,
we both understand then"

259
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:20,408
"what's the meaning
of understanding '.7

260
00:27:58,443 --> 00:28:02,949
Salkal, he is Gorak, union leader.

261
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,389
He has come hele to discuss
the Radhika Mills issue.

262
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:31,979
Salkal, they filed 500 workers.

263
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,421
They are on streets.

264
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:36,390
These rich guys should
he taught a lesson.

265
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:41,991
It is not a slime
fol the rich to he rich.

266
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,996
And those workers...

267
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:54,641
"Alley have been influenced.

268
00:28:57,635 --> 00:29:04,245
And I know who influenced them.

269

Me?

272
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:27,966
This shows
that they have bought you.

273
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:40,521
Leave.

274
00:29:41,212 --> 00:29:42,213

276
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:55,627
Chicken!

Till you don't know how to deal with
the whole matleL.

278

...no outsider should
know what you are thinking.

279
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:29,470
You: uncle Shankal...

280
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:33,669
...would never do what you just did.

281
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:39,776
I anl not Shankal.

282
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,087
My name is Shivaji.

283
00:30:56,688 --> 00:31:00,226
And I cannot tolerate anyone
insulting you in front of rue.

284
00:31:03,094 --> 00:31:04,004
Satkat.

285
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:07,635
"Govinda, Govinda, Govinda..."

286
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:11,511
"Govinda, Govinda, Govinda..."

287
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:19,250
"Govinda, Govinda."

288
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:26,660
"Govinda, Govinda."

289
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:29,357
"Govinda, Govinda, Govinda..."

290
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:31,689
Mahatma Gandhi had said LhaL.

291
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:38,632
...if someone slaps you on
one cheek offer hitn you: other cheek.

292
00:31:38,763 --> 00:31:41,039
But this Gandhi says...

293
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:46,078
...y0u should rip apart the
face of the one who slapped you.

294
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:49,275
I too anl a follower of Gandhi, sit.

295
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:58,153
But I like Gandhi in the
photo printed on the currency note.

296
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:01,186
Because no matter what
the circumstances are"

297
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:05,326
"that Gandhi always
has a smile on his face.

298
00:32:05,523 --> 00:32:10,438
And this Gandhi will
show you a way to reach...

299
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:14,008
mthat Gandhi.

300
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:20,205
Sit wants to talk to you.

301
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:22,749
True happiness doesn't
lie in sacrifice"

302
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:26,020
...it lies in the womb of power.

303
00:32:26,644 --> 00:32:29,318
We have to attain that powel.

304
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:34,662
Ifone has to he a goon
in politics then I'll he one, sit.

305
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:37,757
But I will keep attacking
till it's over.

306
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:39,558
Cheers. Good.

307
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,069
Cheers, sit.

308
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:50,775
Can I ask you something?

309
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:57,676
Why do you trust Gandhi, so much?

310
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:02,421
I am asking something.

311
00:33:03,614 --> 00:33:06,493
Don't ask, darling.

312
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,022
Think.

313
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:15,300
Satkat, we have the news LhaL.
- Ramam.

314
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:22,742
"Gorak met Gandhi for
the Radhika Mills issue.

315
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:28,449
I have even heard that Gandhi
is supporting Deshpande as well.

316
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:32,246
I believe we should end
this matter at the earliest.

317
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:37,250
This is what Gandhi will want as well.

318
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:41,025
Pickle.

319
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:48,760
We should make a deal with Gorak.

320
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:54,033
If we are successful,
the workers will he with us.

321
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:58,344
And once we are done...

322
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:01,516
...we will get rid ofhim.

323
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:32,242
"Advice bribe punish divide"

324
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:35,749
"Advice bribe punish divide"

325
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:39,352
"Satkat, Satkat..."

326
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,755
"Satkat, Satkat..."

327
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:46,257
"Advice bribe punish divide"

328
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:49,730
"Advice bribe punish divide"

329
00:35:00,965 --> 00:35:04,378
Satkat, goondas hit them when
they tried to stop the eviction.

330
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:08,016
I am S1118 Gandhi is behind it.

331
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:10,179
But the goons belonged to Shetty.

332
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:35,639
Shetty, I am only hitting
you because this is your first time.

333
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:38,545
Next time, I will kill you.

334
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:44,643
What? Shivaji hit Shetty's men?

335
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:46,444
With whose permission?

336
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:48,513
Such things require a lot of planning.

337
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:50,353
Wait, I'll call hack.

338
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:52,760
Satkat, Shivaji.
- I asked him to.

339
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:11,508
I feel worried thinking about
the atmosphele in your house.

340
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:12,510
Why?

341
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:17,177
I feel as if everyone
there suspects each other.

342
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:20,615
Like someone is spying on us as well.

343
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:24,186
If someone comes between us,
I'll handle it.

344
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:31,298
So, what you are saying
about Gokul is the 0111011..

345
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:33,991
"Then it could he
a problem in the futule.

346
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:35,729
It could he.

347
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:39,330
But every problem
has a solution

348
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:52,749
“That I said is final.

349
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,024
There will be no more
discussions on this.

350
00:36:56,747 --> 00:37:00,024
“Thy were you being so hyper
that day if this is what you meant'?

351
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:05,492
Just because we are tolerating you,
don't try to act over smart.

352
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:08,502
Don't waste 0111 time
and tell us your price.

353
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:16,001
I want l0 cmles.

354
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:18,009
You decide what you
want to do with the workers.

355
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,412
Stay within your limits, Golak.

356
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:22,484
Don't try to blackmail us.

357
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:25,719
Listen to rue.
- “That I said is final.

358
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:28,416
I am talking to him.
- What will you tell him?

359
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:30,715
What will you tell him?

360
00:37:31,515 --> 00:37:32,721
I know him quite well.

361
00:37:33,317 --> 00:37:34,421
You don't even know him.

362
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:39,730
Come on.

363
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,543
You too don't know me.

364
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:56,207
Let him take 5 cmles.
We will handle the lest.

365
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,751
We will lose hitn if he refuses.

366
00:37:58,009 --> 00:38:01,479
I am telling you, he'll lat
<i>as</i> soon <i>as</i> he gels the 5 cloles.

367
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:06,491
Don't think that I am an idiot, Gokul.

368
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,492
Stay within your limits.

369
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:13,967
I'm Sarkafs grandson,
don't forget that.

370
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:33,712
Salkal, do you remember Shleelaln'?

371
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:35,482
The builder from Pune'?

372
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,988
The one we got done

373
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:44,626
Salkal, there is a gill,
A1111, Shleelanls daughter.

374
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:49,300
You should talk to Shivaji.

375
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:53,609
A1111 and I are in
Ielationship since long"

376
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,449
...she didn't even
know that I anl you: grandson.

377
00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:05,944
“Then, why, what are irrelevant.

378
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:09,082
The truth is that you
are with someone against.

379
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,354
You were against
her father and not her.

380
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:19,359
“That is her fault?

381
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,960
Her father made a mistake
and he was punished.

382
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:21,969
The topic ends.

383
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:43,989
In the position I am in,
I have to take every step carefully.

384
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:48,026
If we allow an enemy to come inside"

385
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,726
"then the enemy can find
out what is inside.

386
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:53,099
Anyway. .

387
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:59,538
If you trust her then I trust you.

388
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:16,450
I am S1118 it's Gokul
who told Satkat about us.

389
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:20,256
Satkat feels that you are with
me to seek your finthefs revenge.

390
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:29,033
A man like
Satkat is scared of a woman?

391
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,561
Not scared.

392
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:32,363
Caution.

393
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:36,274
We call it caution.

394
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:42,046
<i>Gokul suspects everything.</i>

395
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:45,047
It <i>is possible that</i> even
<i>Satkat suspects everything.</i>

396
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,779
The history of 0111 family is such.

397
00:40:50,147 --> 00:40:52,491
Everyone was betrayed.

398
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,594
So they are always cautious.

399
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:02,435
I'll have to leave.

400
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:03,528
See you later. Bye.

401
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:21,316
Shivaji doesn't suspect me.

402
00:41:23,747 --> 00:41:27,058
We just need to he careful of Gokul.

403
00:41:34,758 --> 00:41:39,730
An event of Mahatma
Gandhi's statue inaugulation ceremony.

404
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:42,472
All renowned people
of the city are invited.

405
00:41:43,767 --> 00:41:46,043
I have heard that Deshpande
will also he Lhele.

406
00:41:46,637 --> 00:41:48,241
PIopagatol of non-violence.

407
00:41:48,772 --> 00:41:50,080
Mahatma Gandhi.

408
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:52,053
Should I refuse .

409
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:07,299
"Ymfle great. <i>"</i>

410
00:42:13,097 --> 00:42:16,738
"Satkat. Satkat."

411
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:20,539
"You'Ie a thought. You're the truth.
You're your enemy's doom."

412
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:24,518
"You'Ie great, Salk aal.

413
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:28,354
"Satkat. Satkat."

414
00:42:30,247 --> 00:42:35,663
Suhhash Nagle also known as Satkat, a
well-loved and well-Iespected person"

415
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:39,360
...i.n Maharashtra is hele with us.

416
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:46,065
I also welcome the budding leader MI.
Govind Despande.

417
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:51,577
Now I would ask MI.
Despande to say a few wolds.

418
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,572
My voice is enough.

419
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:10,528
GandJJi-ji used to say that
in politics youl aim should he pious.

420
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:15,630
But I, Despande,
say that, in politics".

421
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:20,635
"The medium to leach
youl aim should also he pious.

422
00:43:20,998 --> 00:43:25,504
And that is the path I want the state
and national politics to take.

423
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:27,343
But I am surprised"

424
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,713
"that here are a few such people...

425
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:37,620
...w]10 have Lhlown GandJJi-jfs
principles down the well.

426
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:44,065
And using negotiation,
bribery, penalty and deceit.

427
00:43:44,254 --> 00:43:46,734
"They are looting
the fruits of politics.

428
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:49,467
What are they doing hele, GandJJi-ji?

429
00:43:51,762 --> 00:43:53,070
What are they doing hele?

430
00:43:55,032 --> 00:43:57,478
If you have stepped into politics...

431
00:43:57,534 --> 00:44:01,107
...then people should
love you and not fear you.

432
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:05,512
But hele even the
government is scared of you.

433
00:44:08,712 --> 00:44:12,524
We will have to say goodbye...

434
00:44:13,717 --> 00:44:18,427
...to remote control politics.

435
00:44:19,523 --> 00:44:24,734
He was the one who worshipped
righteousness, non-violence and truth.

436
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:30,045
And Lhele are those who
rule with lie and deceit.

437
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:35,549
They have Lhlown
politics into a gutlel.

438
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:40,045
And I say if you worship Gandhi.

439
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:43,623
"Then it's about time
you stop worshiping Goons!

440
00:44:45,549 --> 00:44:46,459
Thank you.

441
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:52,224
Get the mike.

442
00:45:02,299 --> 00:45:03,403
Govind. .

443
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:11,414
I have a childhood memory.

444
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:19,526
I had heard from my father
that GandJJi-ji was murdered".

445
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:29,696
But today, even aflel 70 years,
he is still with 11s..

446
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:31,638
GandJJi-ji.

447
00:45:31,995 --> 00:45:37,445
That's because anyone
can kill anyone...

448
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:40,448
...hut one cannot kill mac's thoughts.

449
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:45,448
And it's because of
that thinking that today"

450
00:45:45,542 --> 00:45:52,551
"we see a leader like even
you as a possibility.

451
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,254
A possibility.

452
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:03,095
I listen to your worries about the...

453
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:10,602
...current political
scenario very carefully.

454
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:20,989
And you will get the account
for what the work done in futule.

455
00:46:22,379 --> 00:46:26,725
No matter how I have played"

456
00:46:28,018 --> 00:46:31,022
...the control has
always been with the people.

457
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:36,134
I am only saying LhaL.

458
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:40,439
"You are being hasty.

459
00:46:42,232 --> 00:46:43,438
Hasty.

460
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:49,543
You shouldn't he hasty in politics.

461
00:46:50,407 --> 00:46:52,148
Come on, sit.

462
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:56,651
I think I have waited fol too long.

463
00:46:56,747 --> 00:47:02,197
A good leader writes his own scripts.

464
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:06,165
He doesn't speak what
others ask him to say.

465
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:19,409
Hey..

466
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:20,981
You are saying this?

467
00:47:21,705 --> 00:47:28,122
You have only given parrots
as this state's leaders.

468
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:34,019
Parrots who repeat
what you teach them.

469
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:40,596
I would suggest you
to work for the society.

470
00:47:40,724 --> 00:47:42,032
Yes, S1118.

471
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:46,403
And not for other people's benefits.

472
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:50,437
Si.t! Si.t! Si.t!

473
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:53,242
I don't need your advise.

474
00:47:53,303 --> 00:47:55,112
Greetings.

475
00:48:00,577 --> 00:48:01,988
Greetings.

476
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,387
Deshpande is acting over smart.

477
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:08,661
How date he talk like
this in flout of Satkat!

478
00:48:10,354 --> 00:48:12,493
I would've buried him alive
if the media wasn't Lhele.

479
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:15,263
Shivaji is right, Satkat.

480
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:18,570
Today he was rude on the face.

481
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:20,402
Who knows what he will do next?

482
00:48:21,198 --> 00:48:24,008
Satkat, we shouldn't
think a lot about this.

483
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:26,510
We should kill Deshpande.

484
00:48:26,603 --> 00:48:28,082
We are not murderers.

485
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:31,979
<i>We cannot just kill anyone
who speaks against us.</i>

486
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:33,010
No.

487
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:44,092
Thoughts and views
are a democratic right.

488
00:48:47,724 --> 00:48:52,139
In a democracy, everyone
has a right to think, as they like.

489
00:48:52,229 --> 00:48:54,231
We should respect that right.

490
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:58,643
Deshpande thinks he is right.

491
00:48:59,536 --> 00:49:01,948
But in the end, right

492
00:49:04,341 --> 00:49:09,086
...what is right for
the society and people.

493
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:16,597
Nothing should happen to Deshpande.

494
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:31,610
"Govinda, Govinda, Govinda..."

495
00:49:31,668 --> 00:49:36,583
"Govinda, Govinda, Govinda..."

496
00:49:36,707 --> 00:49:40,018
A1111, the brutal manner in
which Salkal killed you: fatheL.

497
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:45,516
...I can understand how
eager you must be to kill Salkal.

498
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:50,432
It is also true that
if we don't ruin Satkat...

499
00:49:52,422 --> 00:49:54,026
...then he will ruin us.

500
00:49:57,427 --> 00:50:02,001
Don't thin]: of rue to
be like you: father Shleelaln.

501
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:08,416
You will have to anyhow
enter Sarkafs house.

502
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,452
And you will have
to kill hitn from being near hitn.

503
00:50:17,647 --> 00:50:20,457
Salkal doesn't want
rue to go out alone.

504
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:24,263
Anything can happen anytime.

505
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:30,361
Okay then, you don't go out.
I'll come home to meet you.

506
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:34,470
And pelhaps, I'll get a
chance to meet Satkat as well.

507
00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:40,548
I'll come to meet you.

508
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:43,182
Anyway, everyone is worried.

509
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,683
And I don't want it now

510
00:50:47,778 --> 00:50:49,348
At the right time"

511
00:50:51,281 --> 00:50:53,158
...l']I introduce you to Satkat.

512
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:54,292
Okay.

513
00:51:01,525 --> 00:51:03,732
Nagle is simply amazing.

514
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:10,310
He looks like a saint but
he is a mastermind of politics.

515
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:14,038
0111 path won't he clear
until we get rid ofhim.

516
00:51:14,604 --> 00:51:20,555
There is no blood behind any project.

517
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:21,520
<i>Huh. .</i>

518
00:51:24,648 --> 00:51:30,257
This man cannot lose as
long has he has public support.

519
00:51:30,454 --> 00:51:33,560
<i>Afiex the death of both his sons...</i>

520
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:36,465
...he has become even more dangerous.

521
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:39,063
He has become crazy and stubborn.

522
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:42,269
That's why"

523
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:47,078
...I am worried fol you.

524
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,144
1V1 other. .

525
00:51:51,641 --> 00:51:53,678
Nothing will happen to me.

526
00:51:57,047 --> 00:51:59,687
He won't date to mess with me.

527
00:52:01,585 --> 00:52:03,531
Because if anything happens to me..

528
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:07,127
"The first person to
he suspected will he Nagle.

529
00:52:08,325 --> 00:52:11,101
He will protect me.

530
00:52:19,736 --> 00:52:24,651
But the problem is that
his grandson Shivaji is hele..

531
00:52:25,442 --> 00:52:28,753
"And that has rekindled
the file within Satkat.

532
00:52:29,112 --> 00:52:30,614
Shivaji is young .

533
00:52:31,515 --> 00:52:39,515
I feat that he will use Shivaji
against me as a political weapon.

534
00:52:40,257 --> 00:52:41,759
I won't let that happen.

535
00:52:43,226 --> 00:52:46,469
I am hearing something else.

536
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:54,075
Not everything is fine
in Sarkafs household.

537
00:52:54,471 --> 00:52:58,078
A powel game is taking place Lhele.

538
00:52:58,542 --> 00:53:03,013
From the time Shivaji has come,
Gokul is feeling insecure"

539
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:08,026
"that now Shivaji
will be Sarkafs heir.

540
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:14,196
And Gokul.
Gokul dlealns of becoming Salkal.

541
00:53:22,632 --> 00:53:27,047
Gandhi, when we stand at the shole..

542
00:53:27,404 --> 00:53:30,715
"An approaching
wave sulely excites us.

543
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:35,053
But when the same wave goes hack.

544
00:53:35,111 --> 00:53:39,753
...it takes a little sand
off from under you: feet.

545
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:44,259
U know that u won't dlown.

546
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:49,328
But when the sand moves
off from under you: feet, nlotheL.

547
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:55,574
"You do feel you will dlown

548
00:54:00,036 --> 00:54:03,506
And the name of this wave is powel,
Gandhi.

549
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:07,115
It excites you when it comes to you"

550
00:54:07,377 --> 00:54:11,291
"but when it scares you
when it is about to leave you.

551
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:20,493
And the one who can play with
this wave is called a politician.

552
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:23,529
Now"

553
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:32,642
wave called
Gokul is now going hack into the sea.

554
00:54:32,702 --> 00:54:37,208
We just need to suddenly
approach from behind and..

555
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:43,617
"Just have to push.

556
00:54:44,414 --> 00:54:47,020
Approach from behind and"

557
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:54,265
"Govinda, Govinda, Govinda."

558
00:54:54,324 --> 00:54:58,067
"Govinda, Govinda, Govinda."

559
00:54:58,161 --> 00:55:01,973
"Govinda, Govinda, Govinda."

560
00:55:01,998 --> 00:55:05,707
"Govinda, Govinda, Govinda."

561
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:09,507
"Govinda, Govinda, Govinda."

562
00:55:09,572 --> 00:55:12,985
"Govinda, Govinda, Govinda."

563
00:55:13,376 --> 00:55:18,689
"Govinda, Govinda, Govinda..."

564
00:55:21,718 --> 00:55:23,095
Sit.

565
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:57,264
We all have guns,
but we just want to talk to you.

566
00:55:59,456 --> 00:56:00,958
We had to kill him because...

567
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:05,071
...MI. Gandhi doesn't want anyone
else to know about this meeting.

568
00:56:16,606 --> 00:56:21,521
We have decided to kill Satkat.

569
00:56:24,013 --> 00:56:30,623
“Then, where and how,
Is yet to be decided.

570
00:56:30,987 --> 00:56:33,297
I have no problem
in telling you about it.

571
00:56:35,024 --> 00:56:36,332
You know LhaL.

572
00:56:39,996 --> 00:56:45,002
"Satkat is an enemy because
he is stopping 0111 project.

573
00:56:47,337 --> 00:56:50,648
<i>“Sanka: has a million Ems"</i>

574
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:54,313
"then he also has
a few bundled enemies as well.

575
00:56:54,644 --> 00:56:56,055
Those who wish to kill him.

576
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:03,095
I anljust one of those few hundreds.

577
00:57:07,457 --> 00:57:13,499
I also know that you
don't get along with Shivaji.

578
00:57:14,397 --> 00:57:18,209
Aflel Satkat passes away,
Shivaji will become Satkat.

579
00:57:23,006 --> 00:57:27,386
You and you: mute partner
Ralnan will be under hitn.

580
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:28,980
As His servants.

581
00:57:30,313 --> 00:57:33,385
That is if he leis you stay.

582
00:57:36,686 --> 00:57:44,298
So, my advice is that
before Salkal passes away"

583
00:57:45,728 --> 00:57:48,436
"you should join me.

584
00:57:50,033 --> 00:57:54,038
Because aflel that
Iwon'! he needing you.

585

If you support me
now then aflel SalkaL.

586
00:58:05,048 --> 00:58:06,959
We will make you the next Satkat.

587
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:13,992
That's because we don't have
any problem with that position.

588
00:58:15,692 --> 00:58:18,366
We have a problem with the person"

589
00:58:18,394 --> 00:58:21,000
"who is in that
position at this moment.

590
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:24,977
Satkat.

591
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:28,278

601
00:59:27,997 --> 00:59:32,104
"Satkat."

602
00:59:34,504 --> 00:59:38,384
"Govinda, Govinda, Govinda..."

603
00:59:38,675 --> 00:59:41,519
Salkal, the preparations
have been made for the immersion.

604
00:59:42,612 --> 00:59:43,420
I have spoken to the priest.

605
00:59:43,479 --> 00:59:45,516
He said we need to
leave in the afternoon.

606
00:59:48,017 --> 00:59:52,124
But I thin]: you should
not go there this time.

607
00:59:52,622 --> 00:59:54,329
It will he quite crowded.

608
00:59:54,724 --> 00:59:57,432
It could be dangerous

609
01:00:02,231 --> 01:00:07,010
Gokul, if I live in fear,
then I won't be Salkal.

610
01:00:09,138 --> 01:00:10,344
What has to happen will happen.

611
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:12,715

I got coulage aflel I saw yours.

674
01:08:26,502 --> 01:08:32,612
And now, once again,
someone tried to kill you.

675
01:08:32,675 --> 01:08:33,983
This is politics, Pushpa.

676
01:08:34,009 --> 01:08:35,113
It's politics.

677
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:41,184
I thin]: before I do anything.

678
01:08:41,317 --> 01:08:42,387
I think.

679
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:46,229
For the people, for my family.

680
01:08:46,322 --> 01:08:47,528
For millions of families.

681
01:08:50,326 --> 01:08:51,430
Politics is like a <i>chess</i> game

682
01:08:51,494 --> 01:08:52,438
A quicksand.

683
01:08:52,528 --> 01:08:54,405
That's why I have
kept myself away from it.

684
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:56,341
But the way I am leading my ]ife..

685
01:08:56,398 --> 01:08:58,002
"The number of my
enemies will increase.

686
01:08:59,034 --> 01:09:01,036
The enemies will get bigger.

687
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:04,983
I have no complains against you.

688
01:09:06,575 --> 01:09:11,957
But I thought that now that Shivaji
is hele, everything will he fine.

689
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:13,585
Everything will he good.

690
01:09:17,253 --> 01:09:20,962
I think someone has cast
an evil eye on 0111 family.

691
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:28,108
I won't be able to
tolerate another shock.

692
01:09:28,197 --> 01:09:29,107
Hey!

693
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:31,304
No one has cast any evil eye.

694
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:32,470
You haven't lost anything.

695
01:09:33,402 --> 01:09:34,380
Nothing.

696
01:09:37,306 --> 01:09:40,014
I have been attacked six times.

697
01:09:40,576 --> 01:09:41,611
Six times

698
01:09:42,278 --> 01:09:44,280
Different times, different places.

699
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:46,218
And every time Lhele
has been an attach.

700
01:09:46,315 --> 01:09:47,385
"My responsibilities have increased.

701
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:54,532
I won't Ietleat.

702
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:55,432
No.

703
01:09:58,294 --> 01:09:59,329
I won't.

704
01:10:03,432 --> 01:10:04,706
Nothing will happen to me.

705
01:10:05,734 --> 01:10:07,008
Nothing.

706
01:10:14,643 --> 01:10:16,520
And I won't let anything
happen to you as well.

707
01:10:20,349 --> 01:10:25,059
I won't let anything
happen to you as well.

708
01:10:29,959 --> 01:10:35,204
"Govinda, Govinda."

709
01:10:35,397 --> 01:10:40,506
"Govinda, Govinda."

710
01:10:40,536 --> 01:10:45,781
"Govinda, Govinda."

711
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:51,582
"Govinda, Govinda."

712
01:12:29,044 --> 01:12:31,251
Long live. . Salkal!

713
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:33,554
Long live. . Salkal!

714
01:12:33,615 --> 01:12:35,754
Long Live.. Suhhash Nagle!

715
01:12:38,554 --> 01:12:44,470
"Govinda, Govinda."

716
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:49,771
" Govinda. "

717
01:12:52,267 --> 01:12:58,047
Darling, I don't like
gills who have a heart.

718
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:01,415
I like you...

719
01:13:03,979 --> 01:13:08,428
...because you have
everything except a heart.

720
01:13:09,718 --> 01:13:13,689
I had a wife. She only had a heart.

721
01:13:14,289 --> 01:13:16,735
Everything I said,
she took it to her heart.

722
01:13:17,192 --> 01:13:22,039
She used to say,
"Don't do this, don't do that."

723
01:13:22,331 --> 01:13:26,108
But unfortunately, she passed away.

724
01:13:26,535 --> 01:13:27,513
How?

725
01:13:27,703 --> 01:13:31,742
Her heart stopped beating.

726
01:13:32,307 --> 01:13:36,449
Well, it's a different story
that I was the one who stopped it.

727
01:13:40,349 --> 01:13:44,058
Darling, politics is a very had thing.

728
01:13:47,356 --> 01:13:51,031
Sit, with regard to
Deshpandek muJdeleL.

729
01:13:51,527 --> 01:13:53,768
There are a lot of rumors
and speculations in the city.

730
01:13:54,663 --> 01:13:58,236
But most of the people think
that Suhhash Nagle is behind it.

731
01:13:59,268 --> 01:14:02,681
This is good fol Deshpandes
enemies <i>as</i> well <i>as</i> fol us.

732
01:14:03,572 --> 01:14:06,018
I will keep giving you updates.

733
01:14:10,712 --> 01:14:16,719
No matlel what anyone says, Deshpande
has made a difiicult task quite easy.

734
01:14:17,719 --> 01:14:18,493
How?

735
01:14:18,587 --> 01:14:21,193
Darling, come hele.

736
01:14:21,623 --> 01:14:23,034
Come hele, come hele.

737
01:14:24,326 --> 01:14:25,236
Come.

738
01:14:25,594 --> 01:14:29,007
You have started asking
too many questions.

739
01:14:29,698 --> 01:14:33,737
Just like some questions
don't have answers.

740
01:14:35,437 --> 01:14:40,113
"Some answers also
don't have questions.

741
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:42,346
This is a political muldel.

742
01:14:44,046 --> 01:14:47,118
Suhhash Nagle got my son killed.

743
01:14:49,351 --> 01:14:54,460
In the past 40 years, anyone
who Iajsed his voice against

744
01:14:54,756 --> 01:14:56,633
"has met with the same fate.

745
01:15:00,262 --> 01:15:04,210
The state government
is Suhhash Nagle's servant.

746
01:15:07,102 --> 01:15:08,308
I am a moLhel.

747
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:14,677
All I will say is that Suhhash
Nagle is Iesponsihle fol this.

748
01:15:14,710 --> 01:15:18,089
He will have to pay fol this.

749
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:21,420
'Govind Despande's mother
Rukkubai has accused..'

750
01:15:21,483 --> 01:15:24,293
'. .Subhash Nagre
for her son's murder.'

751
01:15:24,319 --> 01:15:26,094
'Everyone knows that
Govind Despande. .'

752
01:15:26,221 --> 01:15:28,531
'used to call Subhash
Nagre a remote control..'

753
01:15:28,590 --> 01:15:30,399
'..who runs the whole state.'

754
01:15:30,425 --> 01:15:33,338
'Despande had declared
to ruin Nagle that's why..'

755
01:15:33,395 --> 01:15:36,535
'..at the moment speculations
are rife on Suhhash Nagle"

756
01:15:36,598 --> 01:15:40,444
Wh0evel is behind
- 'We have heard that some time ago..'

757
01:15:40,502 --> 01:15:43,312
'Both Subhash Nagre and Govind
Despande came face to face..'

758
01:15:43,338 --> 01:15:44,749
This won't stop hele.

759
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:49,216
This is just the beginning.

760
01:15:52,047 --> 01:15:53,424
There's a lot that's going to happen.

761
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:56,530
'Only time will tell
who is behind what.'

762
01:15:57,019 --> 01:16:00,262
'With cameraman Vishesh,
this is Nlahesh Shetty from News24.

763
01:16:00,289 --> 01:16:06,968
You two go to Naik and
find out who can be behind this.

764
01:16:24,212 --> 01:16:25,316
SalkaL.

765
01:16:29,618 --> 01:16:31,325
I know you won't believe it...

766
01:16:33,722 --> 01:16:36,328
...hut I want to tell
you who is behind this.

767
01:16:41,730 --> 01:16:42,731
Gokul.

768
01:16:46,034 --> 01:16:47,741
I have confirmed information.

769
01:16:48,337 --> 01:16:49,407
Gokul is behind it.

770
01:16:49,438 --> 01:16:50,348
What are you saying!

771
01:16:50,405 --> 01:16:53,045
This is being done
to give you a had name.

772
01:16:53,709 --> 01:16:54,710
Can't you see it?

773
01:16:56,545 --> 01:16:57,717
Not just LhaL.

774
01:16:59,348 --> 01:17:02,386
"He is making his own group outside,
without your knowledge.

775
01:17:04,586 --> 01:17:05,587
I know"

776
01:17:11,259 --> 01:17:13,261
"you don't believe me.

777
01:17:16,064 --> 01:17:17,304
I can understand.

778
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:20,605
Gokul has been loyal
to you all these years.

779
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:25,383
And perhaps, you haven't trusted
anyone as much other than uncle Shankal.

780
01:17:26,208 --> 01:17:30,520
But Salkal, you don't need
to believe in what I say.

781
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:35,492
Because I can prove what I anl saying.

782
01:17:35,617 --> 01:17:37,995
I can prove that you: Gokul.

783
01:17:42,324 --> 01:17:43,598
This is the truth about him.

784
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:53,210
Aflel Satkat...

785
01:17:55,537 --> 01:17:57,448
I'll make you the next Satkat.

786
01:18:00,042 --> 01:18:04,582
That's because I don't have
any problem with that position.

787
01:18:06,281 --> 01:18:08,693
I have a problem with the person"

788
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:11,396
"who is holding that
position at this moment.

789
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:15,191
Satkat.

790
01:18:24,399 --> 01:18:25,707
It is true, Satkat.

791
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:29,410
What you saw is the truth.

792
01:18:32,074 --> 01:18:33,610
But it is only the half-truth.

793
01:18:34,409 --> 01:18:35,581
I didn't go to meet Gandhi.

794
01:18:35,610 --> 01:18:37,419
They had folced me to meet him.

795
01:18:38,413 --> 01:18:39,721
I spoke to Ralnan about it.

796
01:18:39,981 --> 01:18:42,188
And we decided that
we wouldn't tell you.

797
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:45,323
You wouldn't believe
me even if I had told you..

798
01:18:45,387 --> 01:18:48,732
"That someone close to you has joined
hands with them to get rid of you.

799
01:18:49,991 --> 01:18:54,235
Satkat, this Gandhi,
Golak, they are just puppets.

800
01:18:54,329 --> 01:18:55,330
They are just pawns in this game.

801
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:56,738
The real player

802
01:19:01,937 --> 01:19:02,677
Who?

803
01:19:09,177 --> 01:19:10,281
Who?

804
01:19:19,688 --> 01:19:24,194
Satkat, it's Shivaji.

805
01:19:27,195 --> 01:19:28,299
Shivaji.

806
01:19:37,405 --> 01:19:40,284
I know that you
don't believe in me.

807
01:19:41,576 --> 01:19:43,419
He is you: flesh and
blood and I anl an outsider.

808
01:19:44,379 --> 01:19:45,323
An outsider

809
01:19:46,982 --> 01:19:49,394
But remember
he made a deal with Gorak.

810
01:19:49,417 --> 01:19:51,021
“That happened? He turned traitor.

811
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:52,496
I had told you.

812
01:19:53,688 --> 01:19:55,634
And ask Ramam.

813
01:19:56,725 --> 01:19:59,296
We have confirmed information
that he is behind Despande's muldel.

814
01:19:59,427 --> 01:20:01,100
It <i>was</i> done <i>following
his instructions.</i>

815
01:20:03,431 --> 01:20:04,341
SalkaL.

816
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:13,110
I lefl everything fol you.

817
01:20:15,744 --> 01:20:20,056
I served you without
taking one penny from you.

818
01:20:23,151 --> 01:20:26,257
I took information from
the other group to protect you.

819
01:20:27,556 --> 01:20:28,660
And you"

820
01:20:31,126 --> 01:20:32,264
You are suspecting me?

821
01:20:35,764 --> 01:20:39,769
Because he is you: flesh
and blood and I anl an outsider?

822
01:20:45,574 --> 01:20:47,645
He is not your flesh and blood.

823
01:20:49,578 --> 01:20:50,556
He isn't.

824
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:56,153
He is hele only to break you.

825
01:20:56,751 --> 01:20:59,357
He has come to seek Ievenge
fol his finthefs muldel.

826
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:04,535
And that gill"
his friend, A1111"

Shleelanls daughter. .

828
01:21:08,730 --> 01:21:12,735
Salkal, once upon a time
Shleelaln was Gandhi's partner.

829
01:22:42,023 --> 01:22:47,439
I never opposed any decision of yours.

830
01:22:48,463 --> 01:22:51,342
I.. I agreed to everything.

831
01:22:54,269 --> 01:22:57,045
I lost both my sons.

832
01:23:03,378 --> 01:23:05,984
Don't kill Shivaji.

833
01:23:10,418 --> 01:23:13,627
What will people say?
What kind of a family is this?

834
01:23:15,090 --> 01:23:18,196
You don't kill him.

835
01:23:23,631 --> 01:23:26,134
Spare his life.

836
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:49,468
I know your truth.

837
01:23:54,662 --> 01:23:56,539
I know it.

838
01:23:59,667 --> 01:24:04,207
I always paid a price
for my principles.

839
01:24:07,575 --> 01:24:13,287
But I had never thought
I'd face such a day.

840
01:24:15,517 --> 01:24:18,191
I always listen to my conscience.

841
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:23,000
And today,
it told me that to trust you"

842
01:24:24,626 --> 01:24:29,336
"was the biggest mistake of my life.

843
01:24:34,235 --> 01:24:42,235
The way you think is 100
times worse than your father, Vishnu.

844
01:24:47,015 --> 01:24:49,518
I never want to see you: face again.

845
01:24:51,519 --> 01:24:53,760
I don't want to heat
anything about you eiLhel.

01:25:01,963 --> 01:25:05,604
"Govinda, Govinda."

848
01:25:05,667 --> 01:25:09,308
"Govinda, Govinda."

849
01:25:09,370 --> 01:25:13,318
"Govinda, Govinda."

850
01:25:13,408 --> 01:25:17,515
"Govinda, Govinda."

851
01:25:20,715 --> 01:25:22,023
Who are you?

852
01:25:22,517 --> 01:25:23,587
Don't he scared.

853
01:25:23,985 --> 01:25:26,625
If I wanted to kill you,
I would've killed you long hack.

854

I know you are one
of gangstel Bhosle's men.

855

I have an offer for you.

856
01:25:37,532 --> 01:25:38,738
This news is hot in the market.

857
01:25:39,734 --> 01:25:43,511
That matlel between Satkat
and Shivaji is quite serious.

858
01:25:44,506 --> 01:25:46,315
That's why Gokul and
Ralnan didn't show up.

859
01:25:47,542 --> 01:25:49,249
Their men are also worried.

860
01:25:50,345 --> 01:25:51,551
It is a good opportunity"

861
01:25:53,414 --> 01:25:55,223
...fol us to kill Salkal.

862
01:25:59,754 --> 01:26:02,997
But before that we
need to confirm this news"

01:26:04,692 --> 01:26:08,071
...w]1ethel the fight between
the two is true ol not.

864
01:26:08,263 --> 01:26:09,367
It is true.

865
01:26:17,972 --> 01:26:19,315
My name is Shivaji.

866
01:26:22,410 --> 01:26:23,582
Shivaji Nagle.

I am S1118 you've heard my name.

868
01:26:30,718 --> 01:26:32,197
How did you find out about this place?

869
01:26:32,420 --> 01:26:36,732
Bhonsle in this date and age,
there is no such thing as a secret.

870
01:26:37,225 --> 01:26:38,636
Come to the point.

871
01:26:41,529 --> 01:26:42,439
<i>Bill“!</i>

872
01:26:51,105 --> 01:26:53,711
The money you refused to pay Billm.

873
01:26:54,509 --> 01:26:59,720
...I paid him double.

874
01:27:02,984 --> 01:27:08,662
Feal and greed can make
anyone turn traitor,

875
01:27:09,190 --> 01:27:11,067
<i>Ovel smartness as well, Shivaji.</i>

876
01:27:12,393 --> 01:27:13,463
Bhonsle

877
01:27:14,195 --> 01:27:15,503
I don't have much time.

878
01:27:16,464 --> 01:27:18,307
Your enemy is the same as mine.

879
01:27:18,967 --> 01:27:20,071
Satkat.

880
01:27:21,703 --> 01:27:22,977
Sit down

881
01:27:30,712 --> 01:27:32,089
Now listen"

882
01:27:33,481 --> 01:27:34,687
Satkat always says
that you gain strength.

883
01:27:34,716 --> 01:27:37,219
"By coming together
and not by going against.

884
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:42,330
I know that in this day and age
you are the best in the underworld.

885
01:27:43,524 --> 01:27:45,299
0111 powers should unite.

886
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:55,609
In a mission to end Sarkafs
reign and business".

887
01:27:55,737 --> 01:27:58,343
...I have come hele to
do partnership with you.

888
01:28:08,049 --> 01:28:09,187
I have a condition.

889
01:28:17,692 --> 01:28:19,365
I knew this would he your condition.

890
01:28:21,296 --> 01:28:23,298
Billu was no longer useful to rue.

891
01:28:28,202 --> 01:28:29,977
<i>Now let's get down to 0111 business.</i>

892
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:44,327
Shivaji isn't the first
man to vow to kill me.

893
01:28:48,022 --> 01:28:50,229
I have stopped counting.

894
01:28:50,525 --> 01:28:53,529
So many have come and gone.

895
01:28:53,628 --> 01:28:58,441
A1111, everything in my
life has suddenly changed.

896
01:29:01,636 --> 01:29:03,377
Now nothing is same as before.

897
01:29:04,238 --> 01:29:06,445
And nothing will he
same in the futule as well.

898
01:29:20,488 --> 01:29:25,699
I won't stop until
I am not done with Satkat.

899
01:29:30,965 --> 01:29:37,382
A1111, all my strength
and I are with you in this.

900
01:29:39,307 --> 01:29:40,411
Cheers.

901
01:29:42,410 --> 01:29:48,190
He is joining hands with all those
whom you didn't even want to talk to.

902
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:50,624
Golak, Gandhi,
everyone has joined hands with him.

903
01:29:56,991 --> 01:29:59,301
No matlel how many mice get togeLheL.

904
01:30:00,428 --> 01:30:03,307
"Forget a tiger
they cannot even hurt a cat.

905
01:30:03,731 --> 01:30:06,439
Satkat always says
that you gain strength.

906
01:30:07,001 --> 01:30:08,105
"By coming together
and not by going against.

907
01:30:11,339 --> 01:30:13,341
We don't have much time lefl now.

908
01:30:14,008 --> 01:30:19,253
I know that you want to
know why I hate Satkat so much.

909
01:30:20,214 --> 01:30:23,354
Only I know the reason behind that.

910
01:30:24,018 --> 01:30:25,759
And I don't need to tell all of you.

911
01:30:26,020 --> 01:30:28,261
What we need to do is ruin Satkat.

912
01:30:30,024 --> 01:30:31,469
Who is with him and
who is against him?

913
01:30:31,559 --> 01:30:32,765
Who is happy and who isn't?

914
01:30:33,027 --> 01:30:34,131
And who isn't happy"

915
01:30:37,265 --> 01:30:39,142
ready to join hands with us.

916
01:30:40,668 --> 01:30:42,147
I have spoken to everyone.

917
01:30:43,471 --> 01:30:49,387
Perhaps Salkal doesn't know that
no matter how powerful a lion

918
01:30:51,379 --> 01:30:54,053
"even a group of
dogs can bring him down.

919
01:30:54,549 --> 01:30:59,089
And I am" the king of the lions.

920
01:31:12,633 --> 01:31:16,445
<i>Sanka, he says mm now
he is the Yum king of Mumbai.</i>

921
01:31:21,609 --> 01:31:27,355
Wearing a lion's skin
doesn't make a dog a lion.

922
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:41,767
We thought he was Vihhushzm"

923
01:31:42,363 --> 01:31:48,336
"but Shivaji has come to you like
Hanuxnan to set Sarkafs Lanka of file.

924
01:31:49,537 --> 01:31:50,743
Gandhi.

925
01:31:53,140 --> 01:31:55,051
Now leave everything
else and begin the game"

926
01:31:55,443 --> 01:31:59,448
. .of making Shivaji
more powerful than Salkal.

927
01:32:00,047 --> 01:32:01,025
Okay?

928
01:32:01,182 --> 01:32:02,320
Do you understand?

929
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:06,994
Yeah, I like it.

930
01:32:07,221 --> 01:32:08,325
Show it to her.

931
01:32:13,728 --> 01:32:15,036
<i>How's this one'?</i>

932
01:32:17,231 --> 01:32:21,008
Darling, all those women who
I gave a ling to are dead now.

933
01:32:22,403 --> 01:32:29,446
If you want to do this against
Sarkafs wishes then I cannot help you.

934
01:32:30,244 --> 01:32:31,348
<i>CM six».</i>

935
01:32:33,714 --> 01:32:35,352
Satkat isn't a saint.

936
01:32:36,317 --> 01:32:38,058
We both know that.

937
01:32:39,353 --> 01:32:41,060
<i>Let's hulk Business.</i>

938
01:32:42,757 --> 01:32:43,758
Name your price.

939
01:32:44,058 --> 01:32:46,436
Not everything is fol sale.

940
01:32:46,561 --> 01:32:48,563
But there's a lot that can be bought.

941
01:32:49,163 --> 01:32:51,268
And not necessarily with money.

942
01:32:52,266 --> 01:32:55,076
Salkal too believes
that apart from money"

943
01:32:55,136 --> 01:32:58,583
"negotiation bribery, penalty
and deceit also holds great value.

944
01:32:59,373 --> 01:33:04,721
We can give you so much that
you won't need Salkal anymore.

945
01:33:07,982 --> 01:33:09,325
What are you thinking, CM sit?

946
01:33:11,018 --> 01:33:13,726
If you thin]: that Sarkafs
men will stall the work".

947
01:33:14,989 --> 01:33:17,629
"Then leave that to me.
I'll handle them.

948
01:33:19,427 --> 01:33:25,241
Look son, I don't support
those who go against their family.

949
01:33:25,333 --> 01:33:26,437
Stop lecturing me.

950
01:33:28,235 --> 01:33:29,543
Now these are my family.

951
01:33:39,513 --> 01:33:43,461
You can take your
time to think about it.

952
01:33:44,619 --> 01:33:46,428
But take a quick decision.

953
01:33:47,555 --> 01:33:50,058
'There are a lot of controversies
over the Dhalavi Project.'

954
01:33:50,157 --> 01:33:52,569
'Chief Minister Nlohan
Naik still be]_ieves..'

955
01:33:52,627 --> 01:33:57,133
'..that people living in Dhalavi
have no interest in this project.'

956
01:33:57,264 --> 01:34:00,040
'Along with cameraman Vishesh,
this is Nlahesh Shetty from News24.'

957
01:34:00,134 --> 01:34:04,014
Satkat, Shivaji paid me a visit.

958
01:34:13,214 --> 01:34:15,387
No one in this government
will go against hitn.

959
01:34:17,485 --> 01:34:18,623
Everyone is scared.

960
01:34:22,223 --> 01:34:25,033
If Salkal continues
to work like

961
01:34:25,526 --> 01:34:28,234
"then Lhele will he no place
lefl fol me in Mahatashtnfs politics.

962
01:34:32,733 --> 01:34:34,644
Now I will have to do something.

963
01:34:37,338 --> 01:34:39,318
"Such that it shakes the
foundation of the whole government.

964
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:40,444
A1111"

965
01:34:45,446 --> 01:34:49,451
Once we get rid of Salkal,
I promise you"

966
01:34:52,353 --> 01:34:54,060
...it will he just you and me.

967
01:34:57,658 --> 01:34:58,659
Pu get going now.

968
01:35:08,402 --> 01:35:09,506
What happened?

969
01:35:10,571 --> 01:35:17,511
You wanted to kill Salkal because
he killed your father Shleelaln.

970
01:35:18,979 --> 01:35:24,395
And now, the joke is that the
tables have turned in such a way"

971
01:35:24,518 --> 01:35:27,988
"that you: lover
is going to kill Salkal.

972
01:35:31,292 --> 01:35:38,642
So, in this situation why don't you
change you: fake love into real love".

973
01:35:39,734 --> 01:35:41,213
"And become Mrs. Satkat?

974
01:35:41,502 --> 01:35:42,446
Yeah?

975
01:36:08,395 --> 01:36:13,208
Gandhi, go ahead with
what we had decided.

976
01:36:17,104 --> 01:36:18,310
Yes, go ahead.

977
01:36:21,408 --> 01:36:22,580
Whenevel. .

978
01:36:27,515 --> 01:36:28,585
A lot.

979
01:36:32,620 --> 01:36:33,997
Needs to go.

980
01:36:41,529 --> 01:36:42,439
Darling--

981
01:36:45,032 --> 01:36:49,105
No matlel how a fish moves,
it doesn't make any sound"

982
01:36:49,236 --> 01:36:50,146
Do you know why?

983
01:36:50,337 --> 01:36:51,441
It's because of the water.

984
01:36:52,439 --> 01:36:54,441
You've become a quick learner.

985
01:36:58,445 --> 01:36:59,549
Can I ask something?

986
01:37:03,284 --> 01:37:05,457
The conversation you
just had with Gandhi.

987
01:37:06,554 --> 01:37:09,296
"Go ahead. Whenevel.

988
01:37:10,357 --> 01:37:13,361
A lot. Needs to go."

989
01:37:16,297 --> 01:37:17,275
What?

990
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:20,706
What is going to happen?

991
01:37:29,009 --> 01:37:30,283
Boom!

992
01:37:36,417 --> 01:37:39,193
According to the sources,
the blast has had a huge affect.

993
01:37:39,220 --> 01:37:44,226
And it's hard to predict the number
of casualties in this incident.

994
01:37:44,291 --> 01:37:47,602
The police believe this can be
a terrorist attack as well.

995
01:37:47,628 --> 01:37:51,235
The Chief Minister has issued
orders for an investigation.

996
01:37:51,332 --> 01:37:54,211
This is Sikha Pandey,
with Cameraman Sushjl Mane, News 24.

997
01:37:54,235 --> 01:37:55,737
There was a loud noise.

998
01:37:57,738 --> 01:37:58,739
Very loud.

999
01:38:00,541 --> 01:38:05,388
I Ian outside and it was had.

1000
01:38:07,448 --> 01:38:12,397
I couldn't believe what I was seeing.

1001
01:38:13,587 --> 01:38:15,692
People were on file
and were running around.

1002
01:38:16,290 --> 01:38:18,292
Everyone was running around.

1003
01:38:19,293 --> 01:38:23,366
There were dead bodies everywhere.

1004
01:38:24,498 --> 01:38:28,002
I couldn't find Ganpat.

1005
01:38:29,403 --> 01:38:33,977
They brought hitn home in a bag.

1006
01:38:35,276 --> 01:38:40,089
They brought my Ganpat in a bag.

1007
01:38:40,614 --> 01:38:42,116
You are Satkat, right?

1008
01:38:44,285 --> 01:38:46,026
Why didn't you stop them?

1009
01:38:47,321 --> 01:38:49,631
You are Satkat, right?

1010
01:38:49,990 --> 01:38:52,027
Why didn't you stop them?

1011
01:38:52,126 --> 01:38:54,106
Why didn't you stop them?

1012
01:38:57,331 --> 01:39:00,005
They killed him.

1013
01:39:01,468 --> 01:39:04,449
They killed my Ganpat.

1014
01:39:04,571 --> 01:39:07,177
They killed him.

1015
01:39:17,685 --> 01:39:22,657
Along with her child,
66 people have died, Salkal.

1016
01:39:25,259 --> 01:39:29,264
15 of them were chjldlen.

1017
01:40:08,736 --> 01:40:12,445
I couldn't look into
that mother's eyes.

1018
01:40:14,742 --> 01:40:16,119
I couldn't.

1019
01:40:21,448 --> 01:40:23,018
Everyone Lhele..

1020
01:40:26,754 --> 01:40:30,463
Everyone was staring at me.

1021
01:40:32,626 --> 01:40:33,764
At me.

1022
01:40:40,434 --> 01:40:41,572
How"

1023
01:40:45,572 --> 01:40:48,052
She was questioning me.

1024
01:40:49,276 --> 01:40:53,053
How did this happen?

1025
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:54,452
Why did this happen?

1026
01:41:01,722 --> 01:41:05,101
They wele all questioning me,
how did this happen?

1027
01:41:08,095 --> 01:41:09,335
It happened.

1028
01:41:35,255 --> 01:41:36,256
Gokul!

1029
01:41:39,226 --> 01:41:40,364
Gokul!

1030
01:42:00,581 --> 01:42:05,223
I always did what I felt was right.

1031
01:42:08,489 --> 01:42:10,491
Always.

1032
01:42:12,092 --> 01:42:13,730
I did what I felt was right.

1033
01:42:17,030 --> 01:42:21,740
But Pushpa always paid a greater price
for this principle than I ever did.

1034
01:42:30,210 --> 01:42:32,053
She lost both her sons.

1035
01:42:35,349 --> 01:42:41,630
She ended 40 years of
togetherness in just one moment.

1036
01:42:43,056 --> 01:42:44,057
She lefl me.

1037
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:52,574
But what hulls me the most that...

1038
01:42:54,134 --> 01:42:57,775
...she was unhappy when she died.

1039
01:43:00,407 --> 01:43:01,715
Because of Shivaji.

1040
01:43:04,311 --> 01:43:05,312
Shivaji.

1041
01:43:15,989 --> 01:43:17,525
And I..

1042
01:43:21,695 --> 01:43:26,610
I could not do anything about it.

1043
01:43:30,437 --> 01:43:31,643
I couldn't do anything.

1044
01:43:37,744 --> 01:43:44,423
I could not do anything
about her unhappiness.

1045
01:43:48,755 --> 01:43:51,065
'Chief minister Aayudesh Naik has..'

1046
01:43:51,358 --> 01:43:53,360

01:43:53,427 --> 01:43:56,340
'..against Salkal
Subhash Nagre wishes.'

1048
01:43:56,663 --> 01:43:58,768
'There were a lot of
issues with this project.'

1049
01:43:59,166 --> 01:44:00,668
'Now there is no
doubt that in futuxeu'

1050
01:44:00,701 --> 01:44:03,978
'..it will get more problematic.'

1051
01:44:04,204 --> 01:44:08,482
'Along with cameraman Vishesh,
this is Nlahesh Shetty from News24.'

1052
01:44:08,609 --> 01:44:12,421
Today you have done something
which only Satkat could do.

1053
01:44:12,713 --> 01:44:14,624
So from today. .

1054
01:44:17,417 --> 01:44:18,327
"You are 0111 Satkat.

1055
01:44:34,401 --> 01:44:35,539
Satkat...

1056
01:44:38,005 --> 01:44:41,646
I know that you have promised
mother that you won't kill Shivaji.

1057
01:44:43,110 --> 01:44:47,115
But let me Iemiud you that you aren't
just a husband ol a glandfathel.

1058
01:44:47,214 --> 01:44:48,454
You are Satkat.

1059
01:44:48,649 --> 01:44:52,028
And all those 66 people who
died were you: chjldlen, Salkal.

1060
01:44:52,552 --> 01:44:56,022
And there is no doubt that
Shivaji is behind that Dhalavi blast.

1061
01:44:56,256 --> 01:44:58,031
This is your fault, Satkat.

1062
01:44:58,425 --> 01:44:59,529
Forgive me.

1063
01:45:02,296 --> 01:45:03,206
But it is your fault.

1064
01:45:03,297 --> 01:45:04,605
You lefl him loose.

1065
01:45:05,599 --> 01:45:08,580
Now he is entering 0111 territory
and planning to kill you.

1066
01:45:09,603 --> 01:45:11,412
There's no time to thin]: anymore.

1067
01:45:12,005 --> 01:45:13,484
It is time to kill him.

1068
01:45:13,507 --> 01:45:18,388
I beg to you,
I need you: order to kill hitn.

1069
01:45:32,125 --> 01:45:33,729
A1111, I don't care what happens now.

1070
01:45:35,996 --> 01:45:37,737
There are a few things
which we cannot control.

1071
01:45:39,533 --> 01:45:44,607
I feel as if all this
will end pretty soon.

1072
01:46:37,624 --> 01:46:38,728
What do you think?

1073
01:46:39,726 --> 01:46:42,036
We should get out of hele.

1074
01:46:42,329 --> 01:46:43,330
A1111, bend down.

1075
01:46:48,735 --> 01:46:50,043
Who is it, you"?

1076
01:46:51,338 --> 01:46:52,248
You...

1077
01:48:17,691 --> 01:48:19,295
He wants to kill me.

1078
01:48:22,062 --> 01:48:26,010
Satkat wants to kill my A1111.

1079
01:48:28,301 --> 01:48:29,609
This is injustice.

1080
01:48:30,971 --> 01:48:32,712
Sarkafs justice.

1081
01:48:34,207 --> 01:48:36,016
And he talks about principles.

1082
01:48:39,179 --> 01:48:42,592
He killed his own
son in his own house.

1083
01:48:45,385 --> 01:48:49,026
A1111, not just you: father,
he killed my father as well.

1084
01:48:50,390 --> 01:48:51,994
And that dog, Gokul.

1085
01:48:53,994 --> 01:48:56,600
Satkat thinks that he is his son.

1086
01:48:57,998 --> 01:49:00,171
I will get inside the
house and kill both of them.

1087
01:49:01,568 --> 01:49:02,979
First Gokul...

1088
01:49:05,171 --> 01:49:06,548
wand then Satkat.

1089
01:49:08,275 --> 01:49:10,653
He might have started this game"

1090
01:49:16,683 --> 01:49:17,593
He has..

1091
01:49:21,988 --> 01:49:23,592
But I am the one
who's going to end it.

1092
01:49:24,558 --> 01:49:31,203
Shivaji, there is no doubt that Gokul
and Ralnan are behind the attacks on you.

1093
01:49:32,265 --> 01:49:37,613
Always remember that a king's strength
lies with his colnlnandel-in-chief.

1094
01:49:38,204 --> 01:49:42,516
If you kill the colnlnandel-in-chief,
the king will die automatically.

1095
01:49:43,009 --> 01:49:45,011
Yeah, cheers. Yeah, yeah.

1096
01:49:46,413 --> 01:49:47,721
Did you understand
what you need to do?

1097
01:49:49,082 --> 01:49:49,992
And wait

1098
01:49:51,618 --> 01:49:53,689
Darling, hi.

1099
01:49:56,423 --> 01:49:58,733
She has started asking
a lot of questions these days

1100
01:49:59,726 --> 01:50:01,000
Kill her.

1101
01:50:04,197 --> 01:50:05,335
“There is Nag esh'?

1102
01:50:06,733 --> 01:50:08,337
Find out where Nagesh is.

1103
01:50:11,037 --> 01:50:12,311
Listen carefully.

1104
01:50:13,540 --> 01:50:16,544
We made the first attempt
to kill Shivaji and we failed.

1105
01:50:17,243 --> 01:50:19,450
The second attempt should not fail.

1106
01:50:21,314 --> 01:50:25,660
Most importantly, he must have
become alert aflel the first attempt.

1107
01:50:26,553 --> 01:50:28,464
So whatever we do,
we have to be very careful.

1108
01:50:29,756 --> 01:50:34,034
I have heard that he is meeting
Gandhi and that girl quite frequently.

1109
01:50:34,060 --> 01:50:35,266
Keep an eye on both of them.

1110
01:50:35,662 --> 01:50:37,335
“There do they go'? “That do they do'?

1111
01:50:38,031 --> 01:50:39,476
Make fOIII teams.

1112
01:50:40,033 --> 01:50:41,273
Track all of them.

1113
01:50:41,768 --> 01:50:44,044
At the right place
and at the right time"

1114
01:52:04,117 --> 01:52:05,323
35 years!

1115
01:52:09,289 --> 01:52:11,599
It has been 35 years.

1116
01:52:12,992 --> 01:52:16,132
"Since Ikilled someone
with my own hands.

1117
01:52:18,631 --> 01:52:19,701
35 years!

1118
01:52:25,305 --> 01:52:26,215
But now"

1119
01:52:32,746 --> 01:52:37,217
...I will kill Shivaji
with these very hands.

1120
01:52:40,220 --> 01:52:44,066
With these very hands.

1121
01:52:54,334 --> 01:52:58,578
It is now time to kill Shivaji.

1122
01:52:59,272 --> 01:53:00,046
What?

1123
01:53:00,473 --> 01:53:03,716
Even if we get Salkal killed
and give Shivaji his 11110118..

1124
01:53:04,310 --> 01:53:07,223
"Shivaji cannot become Satkat.

1125
01:53:08,681 --> 01:53:10,683
No one can take Sarkafs position.

1126
01:53:12,619 --> 01:53:16,032
Satkat is Satkat
because of40 years...

1127
01:53:17,724 --> 01:53:20,034
...of love and respect.

1128
01:53:21,728 --> 01:53:23,639
This isn't a huleaucmt
ol a politician's position"

1129
01:53:23,696 --> 01:53:26,540
"that replacement
won't make a diffelence.

1130
01:53:28,735 --> 01:53:30,043
People are right.

1131
01:53:30,737 --> 01:53:33,217
Satkat isn't a man,
he is a school of thought.

1132
01:53:34,307 --> 01:53:39,552
But it is also true that this
school of thought belongs to that man.

1133
01:53:40,513 --> 01:53:42,220
We should be concerned
only with out work.

1134
01:53:43,550 --> 01:53:46,531
And out work cannot
be done without Salkal.

1135
01:53:48,421 --> 01:53:50,458
We will support him in his had times"

1136
01:53:54,360 --> 01:53:56,067
"we will win over his confidence"

1137
01:53:56,563 --> 01:53:58,270
"and then we will use him.

1138
01:53:58,765 --> 01:54:00,301
As soon as out work is done..

1139
01:54:03,570 --> 01:54:04,981
"We will kill Satkat.

1140
01:54:07,373 --> 01:54:08,681
But who killed Gokul?

1141
01:54:17,016 --> 01:54:18,017
What do you think?

1142
01:54:19,118 --> 01:54:19,721
You guys?

1143
01:54:21,621 --> 01:54:22,691
May he"

1144
01:54:24,324 --> 01:54:25,530
OI may he not.

1145
01:54:27,126 --> 01:54:30,437
Gokul made a lot of enemies
while working for Salkal.

1146
01:54:33,733 --> 01:54:35,440
Any one could have killed him.

1147
01:54:37,604 --> 01:54:42,246
But we just need to convince Satkat.

1148
01:54:43,443 --> 01:54:44,547
Another thing . .

1149
01:54:47,413 --> 01:54:51,156
Even if we kill Salkal
and make you sit on his 11110118..

1150
01:54:52,051 --> 01:54:53,758
"You cannot he Satkat.

1151
01:54:56,222 --> 01:55:01,171
To he Satkat,
you need 40 years of love and Iespect.

1152
01:55:01,294 --> 01:55:04,298
And to gain that you will
have to stay close to him.

1153
01:55:05,098 --> 01:55:09,205
You'll have to go there and convince
hitn that you didn't kill Gokul.

1154
01:55:13,172 --> 01:55:14,708
Why you could not have killed him?

1155
01:55:17,510 --> 01:55:19,012
I'll tell you.

1156
01:55:19,078 --> 01:55:20,216
I will tell you.

1157
01:55:23,683 --> 01:55:25,219
He is you: grandfather.

1158
01:55:26,486 --> 01:55:28,523
You'll have to learn
from you: grandfather.

1159
01:55:29,022 --> 01:55:30,228
Hello, Satkat.

1160
01:55:31,991 --> 01:55:34,437
I know you won't believe me.

1161
01:55:34,627 --> 01:55:36,231
I didn't kill Gokul.

1162
01:55:38,498 --> 01:55:41,001
I want to come to
you alone and prove it.

1163
01:55:44,037 --> 01:55:46,039
Please permit me to come home.

1164
01:55:48,708 --> 01:55:50,551
Please Send Ralnan to pick rue up.

1165
01:56:04,958 --> 01:56:05,663
Okay.

1166
01:56:13,499 --> 01:56:14,569
Ramam.

1167
01:56:17,570 --> 01:56:19,208
Go and"

1168
01:56:23,409 --> 01:56:25,218
"get Shivaji hele.

1169
01:56:31,417 --> 01:56:35,524
I will make arrangements
to kill hitn over here.

1170
01:56:54,307 --> 01:56:57,345
Satkat, Lhele is a man called Sit.

1171
01:56:58,411 --> 01:56:59,515
He is quite important.

1172
01:57:00,246 --> 01:57:01,589
He wants to meet you.

1173
01:57:12,492 --> 01:57:14,699
Yes, Ramzm. I'm coming downstairs.

1174
01:57:33,012 --> 01:57:39,588
"Govinda, Govinda."

1175
01:57:44,424 --> 01:57:51,433
"Govinda, Govinda."

1176
01:57:54,200 --> 01:58:00,947
"Govinda, Govinda."

1177
01:58:05,445 --> 01:58:09,393
"Govinda, Govinda."

1178
01:58:24,597 --> 01:58:28,511
"Govinda, Govinda, Govinda..."

1179
01:58:28,601 --> 01:58:32,378
"Govinda, Govinda, Govinda..."

1180
01:58:34,974 --> 01:58:40,481
"Satkat, Satkat..."

1181
01:58:42,115 --> 01:58:46,723
"Satkat.

1182

Principled people...

...have few friends ...

<i>K do Business.</i>

1186
01:59:13,946 --> 01:59:16,654
And that's why I also
have to do politics.

1187
01:59:17,550 --> 01:59:24,263
The people I respect, I take
good care of them and I expect.

1188
01:59:26,993 --> 01:59:28,995
"Them to take care of me as well.

Sit".

1190
01:59:36,269 --> 01:59:42,515
The Dharavfs project,
it will take the direction you wanted.

1191
01:59:44,110 --> 01:59:45,214
An auspicious beginning

1192
01:59:45,978 --> 01:59:47,013
It's just the beginning.

1193
01:59:48,681 --> 01:59:50,718
OLhel plojecls...

1194
01:59:53,619 --> 01:59:57,431
well will be
done under you: guidance.

1195
02:00:00,126 --> 02:00:01,696
I stay abroad

1196
02:00:04,297 --> 02:00:08,609
"but I am well informed
of what's happening hele.

1197
02:00:12,004 --> 02:00:16,453
I also heard about you: grandson.

1198
02:00:19,445 --> 02:00:23,052
Some from the media
and some from CNI Naik.

1199
02:00:28,454 --> 02:00:32,061
If you want,
I can help you kill your grandson.

1200
02:00:36,262 --> 02:00:39,266
No matter how big
a monster Shivaji

1201
02:00:41,167 --> 02:00:46,048
"he shouldn't have killed
Gokul who was like a son to you.

1202
02:00:50,676 --> 02:00:55,386
Shivaji didn't get
Gokul killed, I did.

1203
02:01:10,696 --> 02:01:16,237
Everything that has happened
so fax was planned by me.

1204
02:01:18,037 --> 02:01:19,015
By me.

1205
02:01:28,547 --> 02:01:32,552
I told Shivaji.

1206
02:01:34,253 --> 02:01:36,563
"That if we are togeLheL.

1207
02:01:37,456 --> 02:01:38,628
If we stay togeLheL.

1208
02:01:38,658 --> 02:01:45,473
"Then it will take quite
long to recognize the enemy.

1209
02:01:47,366 --> 02:01:50,643
But if.. Sugar?

1210
02:01:54,173 --> 02:01:58,588
If we make them believe"

1211
02:01:58,678 --> 02:02:02,524
"that we are against each othen.

1212
02:02:03,716 --> 02:02:08,722
"Then all those who are 0111 enemies.

02:02:10,723 --> 02:02:12,725
Come out in the open.

1214
02:02:21,233 --> 02:02:23,543
Like you came out

1215
02:02:32,611 --> 02:02:33,612
MI. Gandhi.

1216
02:02:37,016 --> 02:02:38,461
Your joke came true.

1217
02:02:39,018 --> 02:02:39,655
Joke?

1218
02:02:41,020 --> 02:02:41,760
Which joke?

1219
02:02:42,355 --> 02:02:44,426
Shivaji introduced me to Satkat.

1220
02:02:46,325 --> 02:02:48,236
And Salkal proved that...

1221
02:02:49,729 --> 02:02:54,269
he didn't kill my father, you did.

1222
02:03:32,538 --> 02:03:36,748
You lured Gokul into temptation.

1223
02:03:37,643 --> 02:03:43,059
You offered hitn Sarkafs position.

1224
02:03:43,549 --> 02:03:49,761
He folgot his years of
loyalty and set out to betray me.

1225
02:03:51,457 --> 02:03:53,061
He got insecure

1226
02:03:53,626 --> 02:03:56,664
"from the time Shivaji came hele..

1227
02:03:58,531 --> 02:04:02,673
"That his position
in this house is in danger.

1228
02:04:03,969 --> 02:04:07,974
Greed and fear...

1229
02:04:09,008 --> 02:04:12,421
...can make anyone turn traitor.

1230
02:04:12,978 --> 02:04:20,692
He spoke to CNI Naik and
got the Dhalavi project cleared.

Only Shivaji,
Pushpa and I knew the truth.

1237
02:05:02,695 --> 02:05:05,972
Only the thlee of us.

1238

Aflel looking at Gokul's dead body"

1239
02:05:17,510 --> 02:05:19,217
...I expressed a lot of grief

1240
02:05:21,714 --> 02:05:23,091
I shed a few tears.

1241
02:05:25,217 --> 02:05:30,030

02:05:41,100 --> 02:05:47,608
It was done to convince you that
I really want to kill Shivaji.

1245
