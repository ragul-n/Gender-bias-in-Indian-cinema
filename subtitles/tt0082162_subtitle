1
00:02:51,829 --> 00:03:03,041
<i>"The smoke rises from your desires."</i>

2
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:10,454
<i>"Where does the smoke rises from?"</i>

3
00:03:24,602 --> 00:03:33,977
<i>"I will tell her today."</i>

4
00:03:36,089 --> 00:03:47,259
<i>"Wherever it rises from."</i>

5
00:03:47,618 --> 00:03:58,260
<i>"Where does the smoke rises from?"</i>

6
00:03:58,661 --> 00:04:07,260
<i>"It rises from the heart."</i>

7
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:11,393
Now its your turn,
tell us which song should be played.

8
00:04:11,795 --> 00:04:14,244
Let me have peace for 10 minutes.

9
00:04:15,785 --> 00:04:17,791
Aurangzeb.

10
00:04:19,227 --> 00:04:20,684
So then its my turn.

11
00:04:22,647 --> 00:04:25,266
Don't, Aristotle is angry already.

12
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,124
He will eat you up.

13
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:29,509
- What a tragedy?
- Why?

14
00:04:29,589 --> 00:04:31,177
Holidays are going on.

15
00:04:31,257 --> 00:04:34,560
And three youngsters are
spending their time in a room.

16
00:04:35,591 --> 00:04:38,648
- Same rotten room!
- Same rotten life.

17
00:04:39,476 --> 00:04:42,466
- And same old cigarette.
- Don't abuse this cigarette.

18
00:04:42,956 --> 00:04:45,811
This is the only inspiration to live.

19
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:54,273
There is no wish but only smoke.

20
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,724
We ourselves don't give
attention to girls.

21
00:05:02,393 --> 00:05:03,593
Otherwise there is no
shortage of girls in Delhi.

22
00:05:03,799 --> 00:05:05,410
There are thousands of them.

23
00:05:05,799 --> 00:05:08,264
The only regret is that
in these thousand girls...

24
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:11,107
...you have not spoken
to a single girl.

25
00:05:11,187 --> 00:05:13,398
Keep quiet and let me study
for some time, at least.

26
00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:16,122
We won't give.
What's this you are always studying.

27
00:05:16,674 --> 00:05:17,442
Give it to me.

28
00:05:18,296 --> 00:05:19,366
Have some limit.

29
00:05:21,885 --> 00:05:25,344
Omi, please empty the ashtray
it cannot carry more burden.

30
00:05:25,424 --> 00:05:27,636
What do you think?
Is Omi your father's servant?

31
00:05:39,592 --> 00:05:43,030
Somu, Siddharth,
come fast, run. Girl!

32
00:05:43,797 --> 00:05:45,895
- Somu, Siddharth.
- Yeah!

33
00:05:47,646 --> 00:05:49,841
What happened?
Where has disaster struck?

34
00:05:49,921 --> 00:05:51,959
- Where is fire burning?
- The fire is burning here...

35
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,446
...and disaster is there, look.

36
00:05:57,355 --> 00:06:00,393
Well dressed girl
comes out of a house...

37
00:06:00,653 --> 00:06:03,561
...there is chaos everywhere...

38
00:06:03,895 --> 00:06:06,404
...whom do you call a disaster?

39
00:06:06,612 --> 00:06:08,958
Look at the disaster walking.

40
00:06:14,503 --> 00:06:16,016
Wow.

41
00:06:16,211 --> 00:06:18,870
You missed an amazing girl,
my friend.

42
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,162
What a girl, one among thousands.

43
00:06:21,242 --> 00:06:22,536
Let me study.

44
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:24,277
Does any one study in the holidays?

45
00:06:24,601 --> 00:06:27,163
I study, and that is why
I did not go home, got me?

46
00:06:27,336 --> 00:06:28,676
So what?
Even we did not go home.

47
00:06:28,756 --> 00:06:30,006
So that you people can flirt.

48
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,742
Look I do not interfere
in your personal affairs...

49
00:06:33,045 --> 00:06:35,638
...so please excuse me. Please.

50
00:06:36,201 --> 00:06:37,498
What a bore, pal.

51
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,033
Bore?

52
00:06:39,487 --> 00:06:41,141
He is a born oldster.

53
00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:45,433
Why do you abuse old people?

54
00:06:45,513 --> 00:06:48,557
Any intelligent old man
would run to balcony.

55
00:06:49,195 --> 00:06:52,557
My dear friend,
you have not tasted it.

56
00:06:52,764 --> 00:06:54,266
What gait she had!

57
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:56,126
What hair she had!

58
00:06:56,206 --> 00:06:57,801
What eyes she had!

59
00:06:57,881 --> 00:06:59,022
What--

60
00:07:00,082 --> 00:07:02,687
How could you see her eyes from top?

61
00:07:02,946 --> 00:07:04,319
I did not see them...

62
00:07:05,768 --> 00:07:07,184
...but they must have
been beautiful.

63
00:07:08,276 --> 00:07:11,605
Fools, who is the girl?
Where did she come from?

64
00:07:11,821 --> 00:07:18,946
"Up till now she must have
been residing among stars."

65
00:07:19,464 --> 00:07:21,789
Are you mad? You even do
not know where she stays!

66
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:24,189
So what?
We will find it out in no time.

67
00:07:29,335 --> 00:07:33,043
Here I go. Bond!
James Bond in action.

68
00:08:04,189 --> 00:08:05,648
Where are you going, sweetheart?

69
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:08,232
Is any other creditor after you?

70
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:09,744
Oh! Lallan Miya it's you?

71
00:08:09,824 --> 00:08:11,247
- Yes.
- So you have crossed my ways.

72
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,653
Now my work will
remain unfinished.

73
00:08:12,836 --> 00:08:14,231
What do you mean by you
will not finish your work?

74
00:08:14,311 --> 00:08:17,258
What about my work you have
kept pending from many days?

75
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:18,480
Come to my shop.

76
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,588
Why are you
taking me to your shop now?

77
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:23,615
Thank your stars that I am not
taking you to police station.

78
00:08:23,798 --> 00:08:25,312
Come on. Come on.

79
00:08:26,004 --> 00:08:29,658
I am coming Lallan Miya,
coming with you. Don't drag me.

80
00:08:30,945 --> 00:08:32,869
- It's a question of my prestige.
- Question of your prestige?

81
00:08:33,074 --> 00:08:34,825
You squander people's money...

82
00:08:35,042 --> 00:08:36,522
...and you talk about prestige?

83
00:08:36,792 --> 00:08:37,614
Come on.

84
00:08:37,694 --> 00:08:41,203
You just come and see howl
break your bones. Come and see.

85
00:08:48,846 --> 00:08:51,213
Come Lallan Miya,
take care of your shop...

86
00:08:51,602 --> 00:08:52,900
...I have to go back to my taxi.

87
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,149
- Okay, my son, thanks. Goodbye!
- Goodbye.

88
00:08:55,938 --> 00:08:57,127
Listen to me. Stay here.

89
00:09:07,374 --> 00:09:09,018
Put lime on my 'paan'.

90
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:12,379
Lallan Miya, I do not have any
hassles in doing this job.

91
00:09:12,595 --> 00:09:13,849
If you want
I will apply it on you.

92
00:09:14,108 --> 00:09:15,989
But at this time I am in a hurry.

93
00:09:16,069 --> 00:09:17,287
Hurry?
It's me who is in a hurry.

94
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,941
I am waiting for
you from 4 months.

95
00:09:19,169 --> 00:09:20,077
Take out the money.

96
00:09:20,315 --> 00:09:23,028
You account shows a debit
of 67 rupees and 50 paise.

97
00:09:23,108 --> 00:09:24,964
Lallan Miya, let go off
those fifty paise at least.

98
00:09:25,169 --> 00:09:25,818
Why?

99
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,310
Have you come in for a wedding party?
Shell out the money.

100
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:30,542
It will come,
money is not going anywhere.

101
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,769
Who is talking of it going away?

102
00:09:33,018 --> 00:09:35,451
The trouble is that
it is not coming in.

103
00:09:36,088 --> 00:09:38,077
It will come, O Lallan Miya,
it will come most certainly.

104
00:09:38,157 --> 00:09:39,321
I take an oath on you.

105
00:09:39,872 --> 00:09:41,916
Fine, I take an oath
on this Lota of yours.

106
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,580
Please let me go this time,
I am in hurry.

107
00:09:43,775 --> 00:09:45,807
I am following a girl.

108
00:09:46,121 --> 00:09:48,542
Why didn't you tell me this before?

109
00:09:48,986 --> 00:09:50,208
Which girl and where
did you see her?

110
00:09:50,288 --> 00:09:52,597
Just now.
She passed by 10 minutes ago.

111
00:09:53,224 --> 00:09:55,678
She wore a pink kameez
and a beautiful drape.

112
00:09:55,915 --> 00:09:58,996
Yeah, you are right and
I swear by my foregone youth...

113
00:09:59,537 --> 00:10:01,688
...I too sighed once,
looking at her.

114
00:10:01,915 --> 00:10:02,575
Wow!

115
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:06,185
Dear, that girl glowed like
a glow-worm here...

116
00:10:06,265 --> 00:10:07,515
...and vanished in thin
air at that corner.

117
00:10:07,883 --> 00:10:10,337
Go after her. Run.. fast.

118
00:10:10,704 --> 00:10:13,580
Hey wait, take my bicycle.

119
00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:18,930
Lallan Miya,
you are an angel, really.

120
00:10:19,103 --> 00:10:21,730
I pray that your creditors pay
your money in time.

121
00:10:23,611 --> 00:10:27,838
And yes, add this to our account.
Now its 70 rupees.

122
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,222
This James Bond even finished
the last cigarette?

123
00:10:51,302 --> 00:10:56,293
Why worry?
I have a good stock on me. Great!

124
00:10:58,433 --> 00:11:00,563
Siddharth,
another case of kidnapping.

125
00:11:00,886 --> 00:11:04,973
Dr. D.P Dhaneja 's daughter
Sujata was kidnapped.

126
00:11:05,362 --> 00:11:07,870
Two unidentified men at Ring
Road took her away in a taxi.

127
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:11,470
Sujata's kidnappers have
demanded a ransom of lakh.

128
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,945
The police is on the
hunt and the one...

129
00:11:14,025 --> 00:11:16,119
...who gives and information will
get a reward of 1000 rupees.

130
00:11:17,005 --> 00:11:18,086
Damn it!

131
00:11:18,324 --> 00:11:20,865
100 thousand to the rogues and
one thousand to gentlemen like us..

132
00:11:21,352 --> 00:11:22,227
Is this some deal?

133
00:11:23,092 --> 00:11:26,843
I have got it. I have got the address.
Congratulations!

134
00:11:27,016 --> 00:11:29,957
She is in our neighborhood.
The next bungalow is hers.

135
00:11:30,037 --> 00:11:32,271
She has father and grandma and
an elder brother.

136
00:11:32,351 --> 00:11:34,444
But don't worry. He's in Mumbai..

137
00:11:34,616 --> 00:11:37,049
True friend should be like you.

138
00:11:37,557 --> 00:11:39,481
- Thank you very much.
- Means?

139
00:11:39,762 --> 00:11:41,859
Means, now everything
will be easy for me.

140
00:11:42,065 --> 00:11:44,951
- Further I will handle on my own.
- What will you do?

141
00:11:45,232 --> 00:11:51,741
First introduction then friendship
and later romance and then etc.

142
00:11:51,821 --> 00:11:55,741
Very good! I found out
her whereabouts.

143
00:11:55,957 --> 00:11:57,233
And it is you who
will romance with her.

144
00:11:57,406 --> 00:12:00,952
It is I who saw her from the
balcony. I told you about her.

145
00:12:01,904 --> 00:12:04,736
The reference with her was mine.

146
00:12:05,298 --> 00:12:08,671
The confidant has
turned my rival!

147
00:12:09,925 --> 00:12:12,206
Do not worry I will introduce
her to you all later.

148
00:12:13,341 --> 00:12:14,898
You and will introduce!

149
00:12:15,233 --> 00:12:17,222
You by then would have spoilt
our names to such an extent...

150
00:12:17,302 --> 00:12:18,887
...that by then she would not
like to see our faces even.

151
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,882
As it is she may not
like to see your face.

152
00:12:22,088 --> 00:12:22,921
Okay, do one thing.

153
00:12:23,126 --> 00:12:25,829
Both give it a try and
let us see who wins her heart.

154
00:12:26,672 --> 00:12:28,932
Let the cards decide about you two.

155
00:12:29,104 --> 00:12:30,304
Not two, but three of us.

156
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:34,348
Please, do not drag me in your
childish affairs, understand?

157
00:12:35,623 --> 00:12:39,223
Sir, following girls
is not a childish affair...

158
00:12:39,408 --> 00:12:41,008
...but an affair of
the young and manly.

159
00:12:41,223 --> 00:12:42,023
What did you understand?

160
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:44,919
- It's nice that one rival is reduced.
- Good point.

161
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:47,947
Spread the cards.
One who gets the queen gets the game.

162
00:12:48,027 --> 00:12:50,056
- Means he will be the first?
- Correct.

163
00:12:59,322 --> 00:13:01,538
Queen! Queen!

164
00:13:02,143 --> 00:13:04,781
Look, truth always wins.

165
00:13:04,998 --> 00:13:06,933
Now tomorrow I will
directly go to her house.

166
00:13:07,013 --> 00:13:10,738
There you will meet her grandma,
father and brother.

167
00:13:10,818 --> 00:13:13,462
That is the idea.
I will first impress all of them.

168
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:19,127
They will think what a decent
handsome and intelligent I am!

169
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,711
Such boys should
never be let away.

170
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,960
Later everything is simple.

171
00:13:24,414 --> 00:13:27,776
I will win the girls
heart with my poetries.

172
00:13:28,413 --> 00:13:30,878
Who knows she might even
not like me smoking.

173
00:13:31,732 --> 00:13:34,521
So what I will stop smoking.
That's my word.

174
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:37,602
Let me tell you,
I will never leave smoking.

175
00:13:37,819 --> 00:13:40,067
No girl can dictate me.

176
00:13:40,932 --> 00:13:45,257
I will tell her in clear terms how I am.

177
00:13:45,754 --> 00:13:48,229
I am a smoker and
I sometimes have beer as well.

178
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,927
Up till now this much.

179
00:13:50,007 --> 00:13:53,051
If you are ready then say so or
else this wedding can't happen.

180
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:57,007
Look at him, without knowing her,
his marriage has broken.

181
00:13:58,261 --> 00:14:00,834
Any way, let me prepare for tomorrow.

182
00:14:02,271 --> 00:14:06,607
There she is waiting for me,
here my heart is restless.

183
00:14:07,115 --> 00:14:11,861
I, Omi, have come to your doors.
Please, take me through.

184
00:14:48,693 --> 00:14:51,418
Oh! it's you?
Come in I was waiting for you.

185
00:14:53,622 --> 00:14:54,530
You were waiting for me!

186
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:56,390
Yes, you are so late.

187
00:14:56,887 --> 00:15:00,141
Please come in, come right in.

188
00:15:02,951 --> 00:15:04,130
Come, come.

189
00:15:08,832 --> 00:15:09,675
Come, please.

190
00:15:19,135 --> 00:15:22,551
This basin is choked
and tap is also not stopping!

191
00:15:24,767 --> 00:15:25,804
Such a strange problem.

192
00:15:26,172 --> 00:15:27,145
The water doesn't flow down the...

193
00:15:27,318 --> 00:15:28,842
...the drain and the whole
bathroom is filled with water.

194
00:15:29,859 --> 00:15:31,502
We had called the plumber
in the morning and told him..

195
00:15:31,582 --> 00:15:33,179
...to send his man fast.
And you have come so late.

196
00:15:34,086 --> 00:15:37,924
Where are your tools?
Have you kept them outside?

197
00:15:38,951 --> 00:15:41,059
Don't stand and wait here.
Go and get them fast.

198
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:48,628
Neha, who is it, my child?
No one grandma, it's plumber.

199
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,530
He has come to repair the tap.

200
00:15:54,596 --> 00:15:57,655
Tasty groundnuts!
Tasty groundnuts!

201
00:15:58,229 --> 00:15:58,748
Yes, sir?

202
00:15:58,828 --> 00:16:00,640
- Two for ten paise.
- Take worth twenty five, sir.

203
00:16:02,142 --> 00:16:03,537
- Twenty five. Fine, give.
- Here.

204
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:09,915
Tasty groundnuts!
Tasty groundnuts!

205
00:16:34,974 --> 00:16:37,547
- Darling.
- Yes, darling.

206
00:16:38,433 --> 00:16:40,444
Nothing.. just darling-darling.

207
00:16:42,489 --> 00:16:43,494
Darling-darling.

208
00:16:50,413 --> 00:16:52,143
Take it high, more high,
pull it.

209
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,570
Let it loose, then pull it.

210
00:16:54,792 --> 00:16:55,959
It went high.

211
00:16:56,039 --> 00:16:57,505
Mine has gone high.

212
00:16:58,748 --> 00:17:00,381
Mine has gone high.

213
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:04,078
Pull it.

214
00:17:05,301 --> 00:17:06,631
- Take it higher! Higher!
- Slowly, hey!

215
00:17:10,015 --> 00:17:11,507
- Pull it.
- Come on!

216
00:17:32,998 --> 00:17:34,717
- What happened, pal?
- Did anything work?

217
00:17:35,689 --> 00:17:38,522
Buddies, don't ask me anything.

218
00:17:39,635 --> 00:17:43,192
I haven't yet descended
from the world of stars.

219
00:17:44,412 --> 00:17:46,564
What happened? At least will
you tell what had happened?

220
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,721
Hey fatso, tell us what happened.

221
00:17:50,531 --> 00:17:53,893
My very first meeting
and my very first love.

222
00:17:54,066 --> 00:17:56,650
Don't beat around the bush and
come to the flashback.

223
00:17:57,115 --> 00:17:59,688
Okay! Then listen--

224
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,347
The flashback.

225
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:20,573
- Oh! You?
- Lady, please accept my greetings

226
00:18:22,691 --> 00:18:26,821
Sorry to bother you.
I am a poet.

227
00:18:27,567 --> 00:18:30,918
For a true lover of my work
I've been wandering...

228
00:18:31,535 --> 00:18:35,816
...through the centuries
searching for a lady like you.

229
00:18:37,255 --> 00:18:40,779
Now my luck has brought
me here in front of you.

230
00:18:42,043 --> 00:18:43,762
Although, this is the first
time I am meeting you.

231
00:18:45,275 --> 00:18:49,102
Sir, this cannot be
our first meeting.

232
00:18:50,194 --> 00:18:52,572
We must have met before.

233
00:18:52,929 --> 00:18:55,567
Met before? Where?

234
00:18:57,426 --> 00:18:58,648
In our previous birth.

235
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:03,935
Tasty groundnuts!

236
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:08,378
Tasty groundnuts!

237
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:32,464
I am making my way
in someone's heart.

238
00:19:33,015 --> 00:19:36,820
Such a beautiful sin I am committing!

239
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:46,637
She feels so coy at my words...

240
00:19:47,199 --> 00:19:49,664
...that she can't lift her head even!

241
00:19:51,535 --> 00:19:53,913
And your lovely
tresses on your face...

242
00:19:54,529 --> 00:19:58,172
...the desires have raised
their head! Understood?

243
00:20:01,168 --> 00:20:04,757
She never understands what I mean
and will never do so.

244
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,654
May God bless the one
who gives words to my poetry!

245
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:21,524
I am in love with you,
is it my mistake?

246
00:20:22,259 --> 00:20:25,459
It's you and it's the mirror!

247
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:29,124
Just do justice to me!

248
00:20:31,717 --> 00:20:42,247
<i>"Think this river is my mirror."</i>

249
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:52,831
<i>"Think this river is my mirror."</i>

250
00:20:53,523 --> 00:21:03,101
<i>"Think it to be the flowing
inebriation of love!"</i>

251
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:21,759
<i>"The heartbeats are creating music,
the heart is throbbing."</i>

252
00:21:21,943 --> 00:21:27,154
<i>"The lotuses are dancing and
the whirlpool is pulsating too."</i>

253
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:37,586
<i>"The heartbeats are creating music,
the heart is throbbing."</i>

254
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:42,915
<i>"The lotuses are dancing and
the whirlpool is pulsating too."</i>

255
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:48,299
<i>"These drops shouldn't
be someone's wish."</i>

256
00:21:48,472 --> 00:21:53,672
<i>"I fear you will not leave me alone."</i>

257
00:21:55,359 --> 00:22:05,597
<i>"Think this thought as my mirror."</i>

258
00:22:05,677 --> 00:22:15,759
<i>"Think it to be a
story of untold secrets."</i>

259
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:26,321
<i>- "Think this river is my mirror."
- "Think this river is my mirror."</i>

260
00:22:42,678 --> 00:22:47,716
<i>"Life seems to be balanced
on the stretched threads."</i>

261
00:22:47,911 --> 00:22:52,743
<i>"Happiness seems to go
up and down on clue."</i>

262
00:22:53,003 --> 00:22:57,954
<i>"Do not give air the permission..."</i>

263
00:22:58,034 --> 00:23:03,295
<i>"...so that everyone else
lose their patience."</i>

264
00:23:04,992 --> 00:23:14,732
<i>- "Think this river is my mirror."
- "Think this river is my mirror."</i>

265
00:23:15,521 --> 00:23:20,170
<i>- "Think it to be the flowing..."
- "Think it to be the flowing..."</i>

266
00:23:20,353 --> 00:23:25,250
<i>- "...inebriation of love!"
- "...inebriation of love!"</i>

267
00:23:25,466 --> 00:23:35,899
<i>- "Think this river is my mirror."
- "Think this river is my mirror."</i>

268
00:23:40,363 --> 00:23:41,196
Great, pal, great!

269
00:23:41,276 --> 00:23:44,201
- Now you will not have to try too much.
- Why?

270
00:23:44,914 --> 00:23:48,395
He has won the battle in his first try.
What new will you do?

271
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,163
After listening to his story
hasn't your enthusiasm gone?

272
00:23:51,369 --> 00:23:52,828
Instead I am bubbled
with enthusiasm.

273
00:23:53,012 --> 00:23:56,893
When Omi can create good
impression in his first meeting.

274
00:23:57,109 --> 00:24:01,866
Then, if I go what will happen?
It will be a wonder!

275
00:24:02,979 --> 00:24:05,217
Siddharth put on the iron.

276
00:24:05,297 --> 00:24:07,098
Omi, get me the boot polish.

277
00:24:08,417 --> 00:24:10,893
The nation prepares.

278
00:24:23,077 --> 00:24:23,856
Yes?

279
00:24:24,948 --> 00:24:27,650
Good evening.
Myself J. L. Lakhanpal.

280
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:29,315
You must have heard the
name of the famous film...

281
00:24:29,395 --> 00:24:31,715
...Director in Mumbai,
Mr. B. A. Lakhanpal.

282
00:24:32,525 --> 00:24:33,358
Well, no!

283
00:24:34,114 --> 00:24:35,412
So, I am his younger brother.

284
00:24:35,492 --> 00:24:38,169
In his Damru Production I am also
the chief assistant director.

285
00:24:38,536 --> 00:24:40,251
I have come to Delhi for talent scouting.

286
00:24:40,331 --> 00:24:41,018
Why?

287
00:24:41,098 --> 00:24:43,364
- For his next movie!
- But why Delhi?

288
00:24:43,444 --> 00:24:44,143
Oh!

289
00:24:44,467 --> 00:24:46,554
Where is any talent left in Bombay?

290
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:50,370
Someone was saying the day
before that in college.. Miranda!

291
00:24:50,651 --> 00:24:51,170
Daulatram.

292
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:54,824
Yes, he told me that
you were brilliant in the drama.

293
00:24:54,904 --> 00:24:57,992
I said very good,
to have an experienced actress is great.

294
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:01,019
I have never even stepped on a stage.

295
00:25:01,223 --> 00:25:04,423
Then it is excellent.
There would be a fresh approach.

296
00:25:05,158 --> 00:25:07,569
See, I've no interest in movies
and I don't even watch them.

297
00:25:07,649 --> 00:25:08,509
Oh no!

298
00:25:08,758 --> 00:25:13,590
Yes, but my brother has a deep
interest in movies. Is it?

299
00:25:14,391 --> 00:25:16,272
If you want I can
introduce him to you.

300
00:25:16,352 --> 00:25:17,711
Sure, sure.

301
00:25:17,895 --> 00:25:19,570
Very glad to meet you.

302
00:25:23,214 --> 00:25:24,619
Very good.

303
00:25:24,879 --> 00:25:26,976
- So you are from the film industry?
- Yes.

304
00:25:27,203 --> 00:25:29,635
I have a deep wish
to become an actor.

305
00:25:29,715 --> 00:25:31,581
But not any hero or something!
Rather a villain!

306
00:25:32,456 --> 00:25:37,256
If I get a chance I can over shadow
Shetty, Danny et all.

307
00:25:37,527 --> 00:25:40,360
I am an expert in kung fu,
karate, boxing, wrestling etc.

308
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,041
Brother, to say it verbally
doesn't give the desired effect.

309
00:25:43,332 --> 00:25:44,965
Show some of your wonders!

310
00:25:56,035 --> 00:25:57,537
Come.. come!

311
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:00,953
Come.. come!

312
00:26:01,829 --> 00:26:03,018
Come.

313
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:10,153
Get up.

314
00:26:13,246 --> 00:26:15,289
Oh.. oh.. what's this?

315
00:26:15,369 --> 00:26:17,678
So Mr. director, how was it?

316
00:26:20,814 --> 00:26:22,954
This was just a trailer.

317
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,084
The real picture is still to come.

318
00:26:25,895 --> 00:26:28,111
Hey, stop please. Listen.. brother.

319
00:27:10,084 --> 00:27:13,468
- What happened?
- Had some scuffle with some hurricane?

320
00:27:14,732 --> 00:27:16,159
- I am telling.
- What happened? Tell us.

321
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:17,716
- I am telling.
- Slowly.. come.

322
00:27:21,467 --> 00:27:23,877
Slowly.

323
00:27:26,926 --> 00:27:29,326
Tell me, how come you are
in such a state?

324
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,857
- Thank you.
- Tell us from the beginning.

325
00:27:36,148 --> 00:27:37,759
- Buddies...
- Yes.

326
00:27:38,724 --> 00:27:41,048
..when I left the house--

327
00:27:50,507 --> 00:27:50,972
Yes?

328
00:27:51,891 --> 00:27:54,259
Good evening.
Myself J. L. Lakhanpal.

329
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:56,388
You must have heard the
name of the famous film...

330
00:27:56,572 --> 00:27:58,540
...Director in Mumbai,
Mr. B. A. Lakhanpal.

331
00:27:59,297 --> 00:28:01,881
Of course, who has not heard
the name Mr. Lakhanpal?

332
00:28:01,961 --> 00:28:04,821
I am his diehard fan.
Do you know him?

333
00:28:06,658 --> 00:28:08,864
Yes, he is my elder brother.

334
00:28:08,944 --> 00:28:12,259
In his Damru Production
I am also chief assistant director.

335
00:28:12,867 --> 00:28:16,976
Really! Please come in..
please come.

336
00:28:20,911 --> 00:28:24,046
This is my brother.
He has no interest in films.

337
00:28:24,251 --> 00:28:24,899
Hello.

338
00:28:24,979 --> 00:28:28,845
Greetings, please carry on.
Please sit.

339
00:28:29,699 --> 00:28:31,094
I will just come.

340
00:28:36,261 --> 00:28:37,537
Thank you.

341
00:28:37,617 --> 00:28:39,332
Nice ashtray.

342
00:28:39,938 --> 00:28:42,143
Did you watch Dusmana?

343
00:28:42,223 --> 00:28:46,079
Yes, thrice! What a story!
Completely original.

344
00:28:46,501 --> 00:28:49,203
Tale of twins separated
by birth and meeting again.

345
00:28:50,111 --> 00:28:53,171
One smuggler and
the other a police officer.

346
00:28:53,744 --> 00:28:56,090
Yeah.. a very
serious story indeed!

347
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,642
By the way,
are you interested in acting?

348
00:28:59,138 --> 00:29:01,279
As I have come to
Delhi for talent scouting.

349
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,717
From Bombay to Delhi!

350
00:29:02,797 --> 00:29:03,798
Yes.

351
00:29:04,339 --> 00:29:08,663
Actually after Jayaji,
a vacuum has been created in industry.

352
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:12,944
If you wish--

353
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:15,907
Oh! How thrilling!

354
00:29:16,155 --> 00:29:18,653
I myself was
thinking of coming to Bombay.

355
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:22,783
If I take your screen test
I hope you will not refuse.

356
00:29:23,366 --> 00:29:28,588
<i>"I would have liked to say no but
ended up saying 'yes' to you."</i>

357
00:29:28,668 --> 00:29:32,318
<i>"Trying to say 'no',
I ended up loving you."</i>

358
00:29:33,929 --> 00:29:37,237
<i>"We have loved and
not committed any crime!"</i>

359
00:29:37,551 --> 00:29:40,751
<i>"Why should we sigh on the sly?"</i>

360
00:29:40,831 --> 00:29:44,848
<i>"Why should we fear in love?"</i>

361
00:29:45,281 --> 00:29:48,416
<i>"Why should we fear in love?"</i>

362
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:52,416
<i>"Why should we fear in love?"</i>

363
00:29:54,373 --> 00:29:59,400
<i>"I've left the gathering."</i>

364
00:29:59,661 --> 00:30:04,753
<i>"Don't shed tears if you miss me."</i>

365
00:30:04,833 --> 00:30:09,920
<i>"Pacify your heart."</i>

366
00:30:10,396 --> 00:30:15,261
<i>"Don't shed tears
if it gets anxious."</i>

367
00:30:15,341 --> 00:30:21,131
<i>"I've left the gathering."</i>

368
00:30:21,211 --> 00:30:26,796
<i>"Please don't go, dear..."</i>

369
00:30:26,876 --> 00:30:32,441
<i>"...tears will fall from my eyes."</i>

370
00:30:32,742 --> 00:30:34,861
<i>"Tears will fall from my eyes."</i>

371
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:43,960
<i>"Be it a mirror or the heart,
it ends up breaking in the end."</i>

372
00:30:44,273 --> 00:30:46,760
<i>"It breaks!"</i>

373
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,592
<i>"It breaks!"</i>

374
00:30:49,927 --> 00:30:52,013
<i>"It breaks!"</i>

375
00:30:52,093 --> 00:30:56,024
<i>"Come.. come!"</i>

376
00:30:56,104 --> 00:31:00,121
<i>"Come.. come!"</i>

377
00:31:00,349 --> 00:31:11,062
<i>"You called me and I've come
with my heart on my palms."</i>

378
00:31:11,451 --> 00:31:16,014
<i>"You called me and I've come."</i>

379
00:31:16,209 --> 00:31:24,306
<i>"A person like you, if comes in my life,
I'll cherish for ever."</i>

380
00:31:25,236 --> 00:31:28,263
<i>"I'll cherish for ever."</i>

381
00:31:29,797 --> 00:31:33,246
<i>"A person like you,
if comes in my life--"</i>

382
00:31:33,326 --> 00:31:37,225
<i>"Let go off my drape
or else people will raise fingers!"</i>

383
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:42,014
<i>"Let go off my drape
or else people will raise fingers!"</i>

384
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:49,215
<i>"Even people are crazy about your traits,
what can they say?"</i>

385
00:31:50,188 --> 00:31:52,631
<i>"Let go off my drape or else people--"</i>

386
00:31:52,711 --> 00:31:53,669
What a girl?

387
00:31:58,241 --> 00:32:04,198
<i>"People please do not hit him..."</i>

388
00:32:04,394 --> 00:32:11,119
<i>"...he is my sweetheart!"</i>

389
00:32:15,358 --> 00:32:19,920
<i>"Now even if my head breaks,
I have hold your hand."</i>

390
00:32:20,147 --> 00:32:24,915
<i>"Now even if my head breaks,
I have hold your hand."</i>

391
00:32:27,401 --> 00:32:34,190
<i>"From ages we have been singing
this song of union..."</i>

392
00:32:34,396 --> 00:32:42,936
<i>"...and we will keep singing,
forever."</i>

393
00:32:43,131 --> 00:32:46,525
<i>"Both of us have kept
coming in this world..."</i>

394
00:32:46,605 --> 00:32:53,985
<i>"...as life partners and
will keep coming."</i>

395
00:32:54,363 --> 00:32:58,287
<i>"Will keep coming."</i>

396
00:32:58,698 --> 00:33:00,125
<i>"Both of us--"</i>

397
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:04,233
Be careful,
you will burn your hand.

398
00:33:06,589 --> 00:33:10,492
You have fought with 4 rogues
in park and got these marks?

399
00:33:13,788 --> 00:33:17,367
Siddharth, why don't you try?

400
00:33:17,616 --> 00:33:19,724
No.. no, I don't fall for all this.

401
00:33:19,897 --> 00:33:21,995
And girls? I always keep
a distance from them. Oh God.

402
00:33:22,075 --> 00:33:24,568
And that too such a girl?
Boating today, park tomorrow!

403
00:33:24,648 --> 00:33:26,978
No.. no.
But what about you people?

404
00:33:27,617 --> 00:33:28,265
What?

405
00:33:29,185 --> 00:33:32,710
I mean how will it be decided
between you two with one girl?

406
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,645
How will you settle it?

407
00:33:36,537 --> 00:33:42,342
Who is it? No body grandma!
It's plumber to repair the tap.

408
00:33:47,964 --> 00:33:52,320
Sir, this is only a trailer,
the real picture is still to come.

409
00:33:55,228 --> 00:34:01,401
Omi, for the sake of friendship
I step aside from your way.

410
00:34:02,191 --> 00:34:03,488
Carry on.

411
00:34:05,845 --> 00:34:11,909
Never! I am ready to sacrifice
my love for friendship, friend.

412
00:34:12,883 --> 00:34:14,721
No, this cannot happen!

413
00:34:14,801 --> 00:34:17,141
- No.. no, friend.
- No, Omi.

414
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,963
- No.. I have left it.
- Don't force me--

415
00:34:20,043 --> 00:34:21,494
- No, I won't go to her, friend.
- No.

416
00:34:21,574 --> 00:34:23,001
...I won't go. She is yours.

417
00:34:23,174 --> 00:34:25,963
Omi.
<i>"Friendship is my--"</i>

418
00:34:26,043 --> 00:34:31,659
- Somu, I think this girl is a problem.
- You are right.

419
00:34:32,254 --> 00:34:34,557
I don't want any problem to
creep into our friendship...

420
00:34:34,762 --> 00:34:36,319
- ...because of some girl.
- Yes.

421
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:37,984
So from today...

422
00:34:38,225 --> 00:34:40,647
- ...we leave even mentioning that girl!
- ...we leave even mentioning that girl!

423
00:34:40,727 --> 00:34:42,745
Wow! True friends should be like this.

424
00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:50,345
Real friends! True friends!

425
00:35:00,768 --> 00:35:02,151
How are you, Lallan Miya?

426
00:35:02,346 --> 00:35:06,530
So professor, how come here,
after so many days?

427
00:35:06,876 --> 00:35:10,151
Don't you remember what date
it is today? it's the first.

428
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:14,368
Aha! So you have come to
pay your pending bills?

429
00:35:15,372 --> 00:35:17,599
Your luck is not that good,
Lallan Miya.

430
00:35:18,172 --> 00:35:20,810
I have come to tell that this month
I will not pay your dues.

431
00:35:21,782 --> 00:35:22,615
Colleges are closed.

432
00:35:22,695 --> 00:35:24,928
So on first of this month you
have come to tell me this...

433
00:35:25,263 --> 00:35:26,571
...that you are still
not paying the dues.

434
00:35:26,765 --> 00:35:29,436
Lallan Miya, I've come to show
that my intentions are good.

435
00:35:30,171 --> 00:35:33,490
By God, here everything
happens on good intentions only.

436
00:35:33,825 --> 00:35:34,647
Got it?

437
00:35:34,906 --> 00:35:37,966
I will ask my wife and
children to remain happy!

438
00:35:38,257 --> 00:35:40,030
My customers don't
pay me the money...

439
00:35:40,344 --> 00:35:42,852
...but be happy,
their intentions are indeed good.

440
00:35:43,944 --> 00:35:45,749
Lallan Miya,
even we have compulsions.

441
00:35:45,829 --> 00:35:46,560
Now just see.

442
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,295
I haven't had a single cigarette
since yesterday. Not a single!

443
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,165
Are you doing any favor on me?

444
00:35:51,554 --> 00:35:55,132
Those two rogues of yours,
why aren't they paying money?

445
00:35:55,835 --> 00:35:57,522
Aren't they getting
any scholarships.

446
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:01,413
Oh! Lallan Miya even you!
Omi has failed again, this year.

447
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:02,365
Third time.

448
00:36:03,013 --> 00:36:04,905
That's why this time
he is not going home even.

449
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,381
His parents have stopped
sending him any money.

450
00:36:08,225 --> 00:36:10,398
Somu's parents are in Nairobi.

451
00:36:10,711 --> 00:36:12,851
Their money is expected anytime.
Waiting for it.

452
00:36:13,424 --> 00:36:15,802
Look, I'm giving a last chance.

453
00:36:16,332 --> 00:36:18,127
If you don't pay me by next week...

454
00:36:18,516 --> 00:36:20,408
...you'll face my wrath.

455
00:36:20,906 --> 00:36:23,349
No one is as generous as you are!

456
00:36:23,933 --> 00:36:28,809
And your chicken friends,
who pass by like thieves.

457
00:36:29,025 --> 00:36:32,819
Tell them they are permitted
to go from this road.

458
00:36:33,058 --> 00:36:34,831
At least they can exchange
greetings with Lallan.

459
00:36:34,911 --> 00:36:36,895
Okay.. fine Lallan Miya...

460
00:36:36,975 --> 00:36:39,976
...now let me have my packet.

461
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:42,604
Why do you smoke now? Leave it.

462
00:36:42,777 --> 00:36:45,426
Its you who is saying this?
How will you run your shop, this way?

463
00:36:45,642 --> 00:36:48,031
Is my business running
because of you?

464
00:36:50,106 --> 00:36:51,792
You always smoke on credit.

465
00:36:52,106 --> 00:36:52,993
Here.

466
00:36:56,095 --> 00:37:02,376
By God, dear,
cigarette doesn't suit you. Quit it.

467
00:37:03,068 --> 00:37:04,419
It's a real bad addiction.

468
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:07,349
Just see,
even the manufacturer's say so.

469
00:37:08,376 --> 00:37:10,463
Let me share with you
something of my heart.

470
00:37:14,193 --> 00:37:15,988
I have a deep wish since long...

471
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:20,215
- ...that a special girl.
- Special girl?

472
00:37:20,295 --> 00:37:21,599
Really special.

473
00:37:22,172 --> 00:37:23,447
- Should say to me.
- What?

474
00:37:23,527 --> 00:37:25,480
Heard that girls say this...

475
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,890
...should ask me
to quit smoking...

476
00:37:29,296 --> 00:37:30,236
...and I will quit smoking.

477
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:34,139
Till a time I get such a girl,
let me enjoy!

478
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:35,566
- Special!
- Yes, brother.

479
00:37:35,901 --> 00:37:37,490
Two plain ones with tobacco.

480
00:37:37,674 --> 00:37:39,361
120 is not there.
Will the 'qimam' table do?

481
00:37:39,441 --> 00:37:40,269
Yes, will do.

482
00:37:41,642 --> 00:37:44,907
Have you switched the petrol on?
Switch on the choke at least.

483
00:37:46,345 --> 00:37:48,389
Where is this pair of oxen going,
all decked up?

484
00:37:49,146 --> 00:37:50,659
There is a play in the College.

485
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:54,119
I have got two passes.
He forcibly wants to come.

486
00:37:54,303 --> 00:37:56,357
- Hey, give back the scarf.
- Fine, fine.

487
00:37:56,811 --> 00:37:57,773
C'mon, kick it.

488
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:06,248
Harder.. yes.. harder!

489
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:07,771
Have you switched on the choke?

490
00:38:07,851 --> 00:38:10,701
Please wait for a minute.
I want to return Professor Dayal's book.

491
00:38:10,781 --> 00:38:11,966
No pal, we will get late.

492
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:13,144
Go then.

493
00:38:15,879 --> 00:38:17,523
Come on now.

494
00:38:20,863 --> 00:38:22,528
Haven't you gone as yet? Move.

495
00:38:26,127 --> 00:38:27,133
Hero, he is, right?

496
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,127
- Bye.
- See you.

497
00:38:56,787 --> 00:38:58,235
Oh! A Prey!

498
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:07,231
- Leave it.. we will be late. Come.. move.
- Okay!

499
00:39:09,392 --> 00:39:11,014
<i>"Wow!"</i>

500
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:15,684
Carburetor must have got spoilt.
Screw the bolt.

501
00:39:15,764 --> 00:39:17,101
I am stuck in the wheel...

502
00:39:17,181 --> 00:39:18,538
...and you are worried
about carburetor.

503
00:39:20,604 --> 00:39:22,453
It's your plan,
so you take out the money.

504
00:39:22,971 --> 00:39:23,836
Nonsense.

505
00:39:25,836 --> 00:39:27,836
Give me a packet of our gold.

506
00:39:28,982 --> 00:39:31,717
Wow! Cash?

507
00:39:32,074 --> 00:39:34,507
Okay, Omi. See you.

508
00:39:35,285 --> 00:39:37,718
Hey! Hey!

509
00:39:39,263 --> 00:39:41,490
He must have surely
gone after that girl.

510
00:39:44,475 --> 00:39:46,658
What will happen to my play?

511
00:39:55,728 --> 00:39:56,809
Hi! Want a lift.

512
00:39:56,889 --> 00:39:58,582
Sure, which way are you going?

513
00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:00,604
- The same way which you are going.
- So sweet!

514
00:40:03,285 --> 00:40:04,928
- That way!
- Okay.

515
00:40:45,339 --> 00:40:47,134
Wow!

516
00:40:48,182 --> 00:40:49,782
- Hey.
- Ravi.

517
00:41:08,572 --> 00:41:10,010
Still tight--

518
00:41:19,546 --> 00:41:20,995
Nurse, where is the patient?

519
00:41:21,168 --> 00:41:22,573
Sir, patient ran away.

520
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,374
I will hit you, fatso.

521
00:41:56,163 --> 00:41:58,206
Siddharth.. listen to this.

522
00:41:58,607 --> 00:42:01,893
VLA industry requires
administrative officer.

523
00:42:02,347 --> 00:42:04,401
They want first class
in M. A. Economics.

524
00:42:04,607 --> 00:42:07,547
And your qualification
fits the post. Apply today.

525
00:42:07,731 --> 00:42:08,445
Apply today.

526
00:42:08,525 --> 00:42:10,023
I do not want to do a job.
I want to study.

527
00:42:10,228 --> 00:42:14,022
You can study simultaneously.
If you work you can earn.

528
00:42:14,303 --> 00:42:16,628
What will I do with the income?
I don't have a family.

529
00:42:17,482 --> 00:42:19,114
We are there.

530
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:23,319
Think, if you earn, our family
will run so smoothly. No?

531
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:49,098
Hey! Go and open the door.

532
00:43:46,506 --> 00:43:48,641
What's going on?
Why isn't any one opening the door?

533
00:43:49,075 --> 00:43:50,275
Has any creditor come?

534
00:43:57,205 --> 00:43:58,783
You have come on a
wrong address, indeed!

535
00:43:58,967 --> 00:44:02,178
Why? C 169/3 is
the same address.

536
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:06,113
- Ye.. yes, it is the same, but--
- Then it is the correct one.

537
00:44:07,194 --> 00:44:08,718
But, whom do you want to meet here?

538
00:44:09,032 --> 00:44:11,940
Your mother, sister-in-law,
aunt anyone--

539
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:12,729
No one.

540
00:44:13,139 --> 00:44:15,334
I mean, no one is here.
All are at their native place.

541
00:44:15,414 --> 00:44:17,258
Must have some woman in the house.

542
00:44:17,338 --> 00:44:20,414
What are you saying?
Here only we three bachelors stay.

543
00:44:33,386 --> 00:44:34,629
Then I will show it to you only.

544
00:44:34,709 --> 00:44:36,543
What.. wha.. what will you show?

545
00:44:37,029 --> 00:44:39,559
I am an agent of Chamko soap.

546
00:44:39,926 --> 00:44:43,202
No.. look we don't want any soap.
We have large stock.

547
00:44:43,282 --> 00:44:44,500
But thank you very much.

548
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:48,121
Don't worry, I am not selling
it to you. On the contrary...

549
00:44:48,201 --> 00:44:49,732
...I will be giving
you a free sample.

550
00:44:50,056 --> 00:44:51,288
Oh, thank you.

551
00:44:51,368 --> 00:44:53,915
No, but before that I will have
to give you a demonstration.

552
00:44:54,899 --> 00:44:58,369
See, I am in such a hurry
that I don't have any time.

553
00:44:59,288 --> 00:45:00,379
You don't even have 5 minute?

554
00:45:00,617 --> 00:45:02,596
Look, we have to finish
20 houses everyday.

555
00:45:02,844 --> 00:45:04,390
I have already finished 19.
Yours is the last house.

556
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:07,860
If you see the demonstration,
I can register your name.

557
00:45:08,282 --> 00:45:10,109
Or else I would have
to go in the next lane.

558
00:45:11,277 --> 00:45:14,195
Oh, just this much?
Then you just register my name.

559
00:45:14,758 --> 00:45:17,082
- Isn't it fine?
- It is not fine.

560
00:45:17,515 --> 00:45:20,553
I cannot cheat people who pay me.

561
00:45:22,023 --> 00:45:23,104
Okay I am going then!

562
00:45:26,281 --> 00:45:28,433
Listen, Miss Chamko.

563
00:45:29,211 --> 00:45:30,952
You can give your demonstration.

564
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:48,497
Come.

565
00:45:56,118 --> 00:45:59,070
One bucket full of cold
water and a cloth to wash.

566
00:45:59,632 --> 00:46:01,308
Even napkin or a table cloth will do.

567
00:46:02,064 --> 00:46:03,491
Napkin or a table cloth.

568
00:46:05,686 --> 00:46:07,232
I hope you will not need soap.

569
00:46:16,714 --> 00:46:17,903
Somu. Omi.

570
00:46:19,482 --> 00:46:20,400
Where have they gone and died?

571
00:46:22,422 --> 00:46:24,574
What are you doing there?
Come up.

572
00:46:25,006 --> 00:46:26,411
What are you both doing there?

573
00:46:32,444 --> 00:46:34,487
Up, you fools, and not down.

574
00:46:38,033 --> 00:46:39,968
They have gone nuts, really!

575
00:46:40,541 --> 00:46:41,330
Go to hell.

576
00:46:50,584 --> 00:46:52,325
Keep that cloth under the bucket.

577
00:46:53,156 --> 00:46:54,432
Thank you very much.

578
00:46:55,913 --> 00:46:57,535
- Your name?
- Siddharth.

579
00:46:58,356 --> 00:47:00,843
- Full name.
- Siddharth Parashar.

580
00:47:01,416 --> 00:47:02,173
Sit.

581
00:47:03,038 --> 00:47:03,806
Thank you.

582
00:47:05,114 --> 00:47:07,179
- How many family members here?
- Three.

583
00:47:07,439 --> 00:47:10,542
I mean one. No three.

584
00:47:11,363 --> 00:47:12,671
Think properly and tell me.

585
00:47:12,898 --> 00:47:16,693
I mean, I am one, single,
but I share a room with two friends.

586
00:47:17,006 --> 00:47:18,227
What do you do?

587
00:47:18,908 --> 00:47:21,978
I've completed my Masters.
Soon going for the PhD.

588
00:47:22,183 --> 00:47:26,345
- What soap do you use?
- We do not use soap.

589
00:47:26,843 --> 00:47:28,465
All our clothes go to the laundry.

590
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:32,746
Just now you said you have
enough stock of soap.

591
00:47:33,502 --> 00:47:36,064
That.. I--

592
00:47:37,025 --> 00:47:38,301
To drive me away, is it?

593
00:47:39,284 --> 00:47:39,884
Anyway.

594
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:45,274
Use Chamko once and you will
never even look at any soap.

595
00:47:47,004 --> 00:47:49,717
Chamko, the best soap for clothes.

596
00:47:50,107 --> 00:47:52,539
Use it for a long time
and use it forever.

597
00:47:53,296 --> 00:47:55,383
To make your clothes
sparkling bright.

598
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:58,183
Perfumed and foamy, Chamko!

599
00:47:58,939 --> 00:48:00,366
Now, look at the method.

600
00:48:04,453 --> 00:48:08,216
In one bucket of cold water..
white, sparkling--

601
00:48:08,421 --> 00:48:09,135
Foamy!

602
00:48:10,215 --> 00:48:13,253
Foamy Chamko..
put two spoon of it.

603
00:48:13,988 --> 00:48:15,793
And then mix it properly.

604
00:48:18,777 --> 00:48:20,366
Now immerse your
cloth slowly in this.

605
00:48:20,615 --> 00:48:21,707
Okay.

606
00:48:25,989 --> 00:48:28,832
Now the action of cleansing
will start deep inside.

607
00:48:29,556 --> 00:48:31,610
The cloth should remain
soaked for at least 5 minutes.

608
00:48:32,832 --> 00:48:35,448
We will have to wait
for five minutes.

609
00:49:20,045 --> 00:49:24,326
Three of us stay here.
Each has a wall. This Wallis not mine.

610
00:49:24,715 --> 00:49:26,834
That wall which has poster
of Gandhiji is mine.

611
00:49:32,326 --> 00:49:33,126
Yuck.

612
00:49:34,434 --> 00:49:36,401
Don't you have any other
magazine to read?

613
00:49:37,288 --> 00:49:38,650
- Business India?
- No.

614
00:49:39,158 --> 00:49:40,510
- Economic review?
- No.

615
00:49:42,055 --> 00:49:47,103
Somu had few film magazines.
Some were cut some were sold.

616
00:49:47,525 --> 00:49:50,119
Let it be,
I have no interest in films.

617
00:49:59,859 --> 00:50:02,616
- Chamko.
- A best soap for clothes.

618
00:50:02,811 --> 00:50:05,417
Use it again and
again and forever!

619
00:50:05,719 --> 00:50:07,622
To bring sparkling
brightness to your clothes.

620
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:10,000
- Fragrant and foamy.. Chamko.
- Fragrant and foamy.. Chamko.

621
00:50:12,584 --> 00:50:13,211
Good.

622
00:50:19,925 --> 00:50:21,460
Two minutes must have passed,
right?

623
00:50:23,028 --> 00:50:24,238
Yeah.. I think so.

624
00:50:25,741 --> 00:50:27,600
There is no milk other wise
I would have made tea for you.

625
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:28,876
It's okay.

626
00:50:32,033 --> 00:50:34,044
Will you have a Laddoo?
No, thanks.

627
00:50:34,465 --> 00:50:36,897
It is made of gram flour.
My mother has sent. it's good.

628
00:50:37,297 --> 00:50:39,935
- No.. let it be.
- No, eat it. It's really tasty.

629
00:50:40,205 --> 00:50:41,491
- No--
- Just eat and see.

630
00:50:57,773 --> 00:50:59,016
- Well--
- Good.

631
00:51:00,594 --> 00:51:02,108
I will put on the radio.

632
00:51:05,221 --> 00:51:08,908
<i>"Think what will happen?"</i>

633
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:11,448
<i>"If you and I are--"</i>

634
00:51:15,686 --> 00:51:18,335
<i>"...locked in one room..."</i>

635
00:51:21,979 --> 00:51:24,444
<i>"...and the key is lost."</i>

636
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:31,006
<i>"If I and you are
locked in one room..."</i>

637
00:51:32,487 --> 00:51:35,416
<i>"...and the key is lost."</i>

638
00:51:36,649 --> 00:51:38,270
- Did you read this?
- <i>"In your eyes--"</i>

639
00:51:38,454 --> 00:51:40,249
Another case of kidnapping.

640
00:51:40,476 --> 00:51:43,286
Seth Ghanshamdas's daughter was
kidnapped by the same goons.

641
00:51:43,751 --> 00:51:45,589
Poor girl was returning after
watching a movie.

642
00:51:45,828 --> 00:51:48,174
Police too have increased the
prize amount to 5000.

643
00:51:48,822 --> 00:51:51,536
Nowadays no respectable girl
can roam in the city freely.

644
00:51:51,742 --> 00:51:53,709
Even if it is a girl
like you, doing a job.

645
00:51:54,218 --> 00:51:57,743
I don't do a job. My father is
marketing manager in a company.

646
00:51:58,273 --> 00:51:59,376
This is just my hobby.

647
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:01,408
What! This foamy thing
is your hobby?

648
00:52:01,488 --> 00:52:03,257
No.. not this. Music.

649
00:52:03,991 --> 00:52:05,677
I have deep interest in music.

650
00:52:06,412 --> 00:52:09,180
My papa says that one should
earn to fulfill one's hobby.

651
00:52:09,785 --> 00:52:12,379
- So you learn music?
- At Sargam Music School.

652
00:52:12,866 --> 00:52:14,347
I have my classes twice a week.

653
00:52:14,427 --> 00:52:17,537
Monday and Wednesday
from 4.00 to 5.30 pm.

654
00:52:18,098 --> 00:52:20,940
Whatever happens
I never miss my classes.

655
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:22,569
<i>"If there's darkness."</i>

656
00:52:22,649 --> 00:52:25,233
There is still a little time.
Hope you are not getting bored.

657
00:52:25,644 --> 00:52:29,384
Not at all. I would say let
it soak for five more minutes.

658
00:52:29,666 --> 00:52:31,266
<i>"If there's darkness--"</i>

659
00:52:31,346 --> 00:52:33,644
Before this I have never
spoken to a girl like this.

660
00:52:33,871 --> 00:52:35,623
What are you saying? Lying!

661
00:52:36,185 --> 00:52:39,136
I swear on you.
I am so engrossed in studies...

662
00:52:39,216 --> 00:52:41,503
...that I don't even get the
thought to speak to girls.

663
00:52:42,131 --> 00:52:45,439
My friends say I am abnormal
and they make fun of me.

664
00:52:46,303 --> 00:52:48,563
Because I have never known any girl.

665
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:51,773
I feel if a girl
is there in my life...

666
00:52:51,978 --> 00:52:53,643
...she herself will
land in front of me.

667
00:52:55,212 --> 00:52:57,525
<i>"If you and I are..." </i>

668
00:53:01,125 --> 00:53:04,659
I mean.. I--

669
00:53:07,372 --> 00:53:08,475
<i>"..and we lost the way."</i>

670
00:53:08,555 --> 00:53:10,767
I think it's enough now.
Let's take the cloth out.

671
00:53:10,847 --> 00:53:11,956
Allow me to remove it.

672
00:53:12,226 --> 00:53:16,215
<i>"We both are going somewhere.."</i>

673
00:53:16,295 --> 00:53:19,005
Now it should be rinsed
thoroughly in plain water.

674
00:53:19,085 --> 00:53:20,238
Should I bring
plain water bucket?

675
00:53:20,318 --> 00:53:23,417
No.. no, not now.
Let it be for now. Do that later.

676
00:53:26,261 --> 00:53:28,466
Did you see,
how clean it has become?

677
00:53:28,694 --> 00:53:30,553
It should be, as I had given
you laundry washed towel.

678
00:53:31,311 --> 00:53:34,446
What?
How could I give you dirty towel?

679
00:53:34,933 --> 00:53:36,273
You are too much.

680
00:53:38,393 --> 00:53:41,182
It's okay, no problem.
I shall leave now.

681
00:53:45,505 --> 00:53:49,419
Oh, I forgot to
give you the sample box.

682
00:53:50,024 --> 00:53:51,765
Remember Chamko!

683
00:53:52,273 --> 00:53:54,089
And yes, there is a small gift too,
inside it.

684
00:53:56,349 --> 00:53:57,884
Listen.. listen.

685
00:53:58,338 --> 00:54:00,057
Listen Miss Chamko!

686
00:54:01,214 --> 00:54:02,328
I--

687
00:54:03,085 --> 00:54:05,896
I will always use your
company soap henceforth.

688
00:54:06,415 --> 00:54:07,463
Chamko!

689
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:30,284
Again and again..
forever.. Chamko!

690
00:54:31,635 --> 00:54:33,646
Use it.

691
00:54:33,726 --> 00:54:39,732
Use it.. fragrant and foamy..
Chamko!

692
00:54:42,057 --> 00:54:44,846
Chamko! Use it.

693
00:54:45,809 --> 00:54:49,777
Again and again..
forever.. Chamko!

694
00:54:50,728 --> 00:54:54,631
Fragrant and foamy.. Chamko!

695
00:54:55,614 --> 00:54:56,663
Chamko!

696
00:55:29,754 --> 00:55:34,737
<i>"The black mare
stands at my door."</i>

697
00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:38,694
<i>"The black mare
stands at my door."</i>

698
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:39,862
Sing!

699
00:55:39,942 --> 00:55:44,964
<i>"The black mare
stands at my door."</i>

700
00:55:45,137 --> 00:55:48,759
<i>"The black mare
stands at my door."</i>

701
00:55:50,121 --> 00:55:55,105
<i>"My hair has been
decorated with the corals."</i>

702
00:55:55,343 --> 00:55:59,873
<i>"My hair has been
decorated with the corals."</i>

703
00:56:00,067 --> 00:56:02,554
<i>"My love is
taking me forcibly."</i>

704
00:56:02,634 --> 00:56:05,073
<i>"My love is
taking me forcibly."</i>

705
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:07,224
<i>"And the whole
town is stunned!"</i>

706
00:56:07,948 --> 00:56:12,791
<i>"The black mare
stands at my door."</i>

707
00:56:12,871 --> 00:56:15,916
<i>"The black mare
stands at my door."</i>

708
00:56:23,127 --> 00:56:28,122
<i>"My dear is all
alone in a crowd!"</i>

709
00:56:28,305 --> 00:56:32,608
<i>"My dear is all
alone in a crowd!"</i>

710
00:56:32,688 --> 00:56:35,203
<i>"And the whole
town is stunned!"</i>

711
00:56:35,283 --> 00:56:38,380
<i>"And the whole
town is stunned!"</i>

712
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:43,289
<i>"Flowers have blossomed
amidst the forest."</i>

713
00:56:43,369 --> 00:56:48,095
<i>"Flowers have blossomed
amidst the forest."</i>

714
00:56:48,175 --> 00:56:50,657
<i>"Some thug has held my hand."</i>

715
00:56:50,737 --> 00:56:53,078
<i>"Some thug has held my hand."</i>

716
00:56:53,158 --> 00:56:55,316
<i>"And the whole town is stunned!"</i>

717
00:56:56,073 --> 00:57:00,874
<i>"The black mare
stands at my door."</i>

718
00:57:00,954 --> 00:57:04,776
<i>"The black mare
stands at my door."</i>

719
00:57:13,545 --> 00:57:18,128
<i>"Messengers have
been sent to the father's."</i>

720
00:57:18,301 --> 00:57:23,230
<i>"And mother has been
convinced with sweet talks."</i>

721
00:57:25,868 --> 00:57:28,268
<i>"With love filled gazed,
he took away my heart."</i>

722
00:57:30,906 --> 00:57:32,992
<i>"The whole town is stunned."</i>

723
00:57:33,803 --> 00:57:38,625
<i>"The black mare
stands at my door."</i>

724
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:42,430
<i>"The black mare
stands at my door."</i>

725
00:58:08,906 --> 00:58:15,208
<i>"Your love is
astride on black mare!"</i>

726
00:58:15,804 --> 00:58:21,966
<i>"Beloved is astride."</i>

727
00:58:22,138 --> 00:58:23,446
<i>"Astride."</i>

728
00:58:23,526 --> 00:58:27,987
<i>"Your love is
astride on black mare!"</i>

729
00:58:28,067 --> 00:58:32,160
<i>"Collyrium filled eyes
have a sparkle in them."</i>

730
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,343
<i>"Sparkle in them."</i>

731
00:58:36,548 --> 00:58:38,580
<i>"I have lost all my senses!"</i>

732
00:58:40,894 --> 00:58:43,056
<i>"My love takes me forcibly.</i>

733
00:58:43,136 --> 00:58:45,218
<i>"My love takes me forcibly."</i>

734
00:58:45,298 --> 00:58:47,077
<i>"The whole town is stunned."</i>

735
00:58:47,855 --> 00:58:51,791
<i>"The black mare has
started to gallop!"</i>

736
00:58:56,504 --> 00:59:00,710
<i>"My drape flies in the wind."</i>

737
00:59:00,904 --> 00:59:04,786
<i>"My whole being is immersed
in the color of love."</i>

738
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:06,958
<i>"My tresses are
on his shoulders."</i>

739
00:59:07,038 --> 00:59:09,131
<i>"My tresses are
on his shoulders."</i>

740
00:59:09,211 --> 00:59:10,764
<i>"The black mare
has started to gallop!"</i>

741
00:59:10,844 --> 00:59:12,343
<i>"The black mare
has started to gallop!"</i>

742
00:59:12,423 --> 00:59:14,018
<i>"The black mare
has started to gallop!"</i>

743
00:59:18,647 --> 00:59:20,787
- Shall we have coffee?
- No it would be too late.

744
00:59:21,858 --> 00:59:23,653
Look Miss Chamko, if you would
have waited for the bus...

745
00:59:23,733 --> 00:59:25,253
...you would still be
standing at the bus stop.

746
00:59:25,631 --> 00:59:27,825
I must have saved
at least an hour of yours.

747
00:59:28,668 --> 00:59:29,576
- What say?
- Okay.

748
00:59:30,409 --> 00:59:32,506
- I learnt a new raga today.
- Really?

749
00:59:33,285 --> 00:59:35,339
I am an idiot regarding music.

750
00:59:35,652 --> 00:59:37,501
My room mates call me Aurangzeb.

751
00:59:38,788 --> 00:59:40,788
There is nothing more
soothing like classical music.

752
00:59:40,983 --> 00:59:42,528
Each time of the day has a raga
assigned to it.

753
00:59:42,608 --> 00:59:43,610
Really?

754
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:45,177
What raga would be assigned
to this time of the day?

755
00:59:47,296 --> 00:59:47,793
Hey!

756
01:00:02,993 --> 01:00:03,458
Come.

757
01:00:12,829 --> 01:00:16,364
- What is good over here?
- Atmosphere is good.

758
01:00:18,451 --> 01:00:20,386
No.. I mean, what in food items?

759
01:00:20,466 --> 01:00:23,284
The Tutti-frutti is very popular.

760
01:00:23,878 --> 01:00:24,668
Is it?

761
01:00:24,883 --> 01:00:27,662
Fine, get one Tutti-frutti
and one cup of coffee.

762
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:28,959
Tutti-frutti for you and coffee for her.

763
01:00:29,748 --> 01:00:31,268
- Tutti-frutti for her and coffee for you.
- Yes.

764
01:00:31,348 --> 01:00:32,797
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

765
01:00:42,062 --> 01:00:44,332
- Do you have any hobbies?
- Economics.

766
01:00:44,516 --> 01:00:45,370
Really?

767
01:00:45,450 --> 01:00:47,110
It is an interesting subject.

768
01:00:47,985 --> 01:00:49,510
I read the books
on my subject like...

769
01:00:49,590 --> 01:00:52,385
...how people read
James Hadley's thrillers.

770
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:55,076
Strange coincidence!
My father also is a Economist.

771
01:00:55,303 --> 01:00:56,244
- Really?
- Yes.

772
01:01:02,688 --> 01:01:06,104
What a strange coincidence.
We met at bus stop today!

773
01:01:08,428 --> 01:01:11,325
Actually this coincidence
was because of me.

774
01:01:12,590 --> 01:01:14,806
That day unknowingly
you had said...

775
01:01:15,293 --> 01:01:17,152
...that each Monday and Wednesday...

776
01:01:17,232 --> 01:01:18,612
...between 4.00 to 5.30...

777
01:01:19,682 --> 01:01:21,347
...you go to Sargam Music School.

778
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:25,737
Today I was roaming around
your classes from 4.00 pm.

779
01:01:27,824 --> 01:01:33,132
Let me tell you, that day
it was not unknowingly but...

780
01:01:33,738 --> 01:01:37,392
...purposely I had told you
everything in detail.

781
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:39,802
I thought perhaps--

782
01:01:41,034 --> 01:01:43,002
Okay. Really?

783
01:01:43,315 --> 01:01:44,072
Okay.

784
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:46,105
And see I really came.

785
01:02:12,407 --> 01:02:13,251
Thank you.

786
01:02:15,856 --> 01:02:16,429
Thank you.

787
01:02:32,914 --> 01:02:36,006
Look we don't even know each
other's names.

788
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:36,904
Why?

789
01:02:37,162 --> 01:02:38,708
I know your name very well.

790
01:02:39,443 --> 01:02:41,952
Siddharth Parashar M.A.
with distinction.

791
01:02:43,141 --> 01:02:43,595
You?

792
01:02:43,675 --> 01:02:47,271
Don't get surprised, I wrote
your name in the register.

793
01:02:48,795 --> 01:02:49,541
Oh!

794
01:02:50,060 --> 01:02:53,055
So.. you can remember
each name like this?

795
01:02:53,336 --> 01:02:56,223
No, not each name.

796
01:03:03,304 --> 01:03:04,439
What's your name?

797
01:03:06,548 --> 01:03:07,715
Miss Chamko!

798
01:03:08,894 --> 01:03:11,488
Well.. that is..
what do you say...

799
01:03:11,568 --> 01:03:12,688
...that is your screen name.

800
01:03:13,424 --> 01:03:14,764
But what is your real name?

801
01:03:15,565 --> 01:03:17,932
Neha. Neha Rajan.

802
01:03:18,787 --> 01:03:21,587
Very nice name.
It suits you very well.

803
01:03:24,982 --> 01:03:28,960
Waiter, get me another
coffee and Tutti-frutti.

804
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:30,733
No.. no, how will it finish?

805
01:03:30,907 --> 01:03:33,253
No, that will finish.
Don't worry.

806
01:03:33,333 --> 01:03:33,912
Yes?

807
01:03:33,992 --> 01:03:35,145
You may go.

808
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:37,491
And listen.. take your time.

809
01:03:41,206 --> 01:03:42,698
I will get it after the Interval.

810
01:03:44,612 --> 01:03:47,617
<i>"It will be wonderful."</i>

811
01:03:47,812 --> 01:03:50,007
Come in. The door is open.

812
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:56,386
- Who the hell is it?
- It is me your death.

813
01:03:58,396 --> 01:04:00,656
Lallu..
run its Lallan Miyan.

814
01:04:02,267 --> 01:04:04,331
Why are you creating a scene?

815
01:04:04,829 --> 01:04:08,591
If you want to play
do it with girl. Come out.

816
01:04:08,671 --> 01:04:11,056
No. First promise us
that you will not hit us.

817
01:04:12,007 --> 01:04:14,504
My eyes are beholding you.

818
01:04:15,034 --> 01:04:17,812
Is it the doomsday or just a dream?

819
01:04:18,839 --> 01:04:20,234
I will just let you know.

820
01:04:20,558 --> 01:04:24,515
Come here.. come here, dear.

821
01:04:26,103 --> 01:04:27,844
Look, open up your pockets...

822
01:04:28,363 --> 01:04:30,276
...and shell out my payments.

823
01:04:31,779 --> 01:04:35,249
Money is what we don't have.
If you want you can take us.

824
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:36,947
Am I going to make
a pickle of you?

825
01:04:37,422 --> 01:04:39,650
How can we describe our
difficulties, Lallan Miya?

826
01:04:40,850 --> 01:04:46,147
So my son, who asked you to
cultivate such costly habits?

827
01:04:46,523 --> 01:04:47,996
Compulsions, Lallan Miya.

828
01:04:48,604 --> 01:04:51,239
Big artists get destroyed like this.

829
01:04:51,712 --> 01:04:53,834
Look at Mirza Galib.

830
01:04:54,077 --> 01:04:56,496
If you want to get destroyed please be.

831
01:04:56,901 --> 01:04:59,077
But why the hell
are you destroying me?

832
01:04:59,321 --> 01:05:02,348
I will not move from here
if I not get my dues.

833
01:05:02,618 --> 01:05:05,389
He has come, what can be done?

834
01:05:05,645 --> 01:05:08,213
We will have to smile now.

835
01:05:08,685 --> 01:05:10,307
Will you listen to any song,
Lallan Miya?

836
01:05:10,387 --> 01:05:11,591
Which record shall I play?

837
01:05:13,510 --> 01:05:17,010
This is the newest record we
have of Bade Gulam Ali.

838
01:05:17,348 --> 01:05:19,699
That means you have
money to buy an album.

839
01:05:20,294 --> 01:05:24,591
Unless and until I get my money
this is pawned to me.

840
01:05:26,346 --> 01:05:30,454
It would be better if you
take the books of Siddharth.

841
01:05:30,752 --> 01:05:33,279
What use are these books to me?

842
01:05:36,185 --> 01:05:37,969
- Wow.. Wow.
- Give it to me.

843
01:05:39,347 --> 01:05:39,807
Tea.

844
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:50,536
- Have you put kerosene in it?
- Kerosene?

845
01:05:53,590 --> 01:05:56,063
I forgot to tell you
that in a day or two...

846
01:05:56,143 --> 01:05:57,873
...Siddhartha is expecting
money order from his home.

847
01:05:58,225 --> 01:05:59,144
We got the letter today.

848
01:05:59,224 --> 01:05:59,995
- Yes.
- Look at this.

849
01:06:00,184 --> 01:06:01,725
- I see. Money order?
- Yes.

850
01:06:02,373 --> 01:06:06,292
As soon as the money order comes
bring my amount.

851
01:06:06,372 --> 01:06:07,022
Very well.

852
01:06:07,102 --> 01:06:09,251
Or else I will drop
in again. Take this.

853
01:06:10,765 --> 01:06:12,967
Monkeys!

854
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:16,778
The foul words that
emanate from your lips...

855
01:06:17,210 --> 01:06:21,102
...inebriate us
in their fragrance.

856
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:37,074
From past two days I don't
know what she is reading.

857
01:06:37,372 --> 01:06:39,507
I think its some
interesting book.

858
01:06:41,385 --> 01:06:42,723
What are you reading, dear?

859
01:06:43,453 --> 01:06:46,912
This is a general theory of
employment interest and money.

860
01:06:47,628 --> 01:06:49,506
- Very exciting book.
- Is it?

861
01:06:51,641 --> 01:06:55,573
Is it funny story?
Read it for me as well.

862
01:06:56,020 --> 01:06:58,263
Papa, heard of one more
kidnapping in the city.

863
01:06:58,587 --> 01:06:59,993
Oh no! Who is it this time?

864
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:02,195
Nanakchand jeweler's daughter
has been kidnapped.

865
01:07:02,275 --> 01:07:03,425
God.

866
01:07:03,884 --> 01:07:06,181
What is this happening
in our India?

867
01:07:06,547 --> 01:07:08,898
They are kidnapping
girls in such a way...

868
01:07:09,141 --> 01:07:11,033
...as the crows pick up
papads from the terrace.

869
01:07:11,222 --> 01:07:13,682
Neha, you must not roam around alone,
understood?

870
01:07:13,762 --> 01:07:16,384
Yes. Every beautiful girl in
this city is in danger.

871
01:07:19,263 --> 01:07:22,250
- Grandma, you better be careful.
- Why?

872
01:07:22,940 --> 01:07:24,845
As you are
beautiful than all.

873
01:07:29,711 --> 01:07:31,265
Hey! Lipstick on your face.

874
01:07:32,778 --> 01:07:36,264
- I love you, Grandma.
- What are you doing?

875
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:39,034
- Tell me.
- Yes. Good, you have met.

876
01:07:39,114 --> 01:07:40,859
- How could have I not met?
- There is a money order for you.

877
01:07:40,939 --> 01:07:41,966
Is it?

878
01:07:42,533 --> 01:07:46,304
- Take this, sign here
- Even I know this much.

879
01:07:52,898 --> 01:07:53,656
Five hundred rupees.

880
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:55,101
- Have you counted them?
- Yes.

881
01:08:00,371 --> 01:08:01,236
Thank you.

882
01:08:03,749 --> 01:08:05,736
I see.. I forgot.

883
01:08:13,817 --> 01:08:14,587
Please play this album.

884
01:08:14,667 --> 01:08:16,992
- Amjad Ali Khan.
- Sure, sir.

885
01:09:16,979 --> 01:09:19,898
That girl was good.

886
01:09:21,533 --> 01:09:23,655
I even called at her.
She failed to recognize me.

887
01:09:26,775 --> 01:09:29,681
Hey, Omi. Hey, Somu.

888
01:09:31,195 --> 01:09:33,114
Hey, strange! Can't you see?

889
01:09:36,574 --> 01:09:39,898
Omi, is this the same animal?

890
01:09:40,155 --> 01:09:42,250
He seems to be our Aristotle,
but what brings him here?

891
01:09:43,074 --> 01:09:44,871
Looks Aristotle has reformed.

892
01:09:45,101 --> 01:09:46,114
Don't.. don't touch.

893
01:09:46,194 --> 01:09:49,087
But what is the significance
behind this changeover?

894
01:09:49,736 --> 01:09:50,804
Yes!

895
01:09:50,884 --> 01:09:53,317
- He has just received his money order.
- Is it?

896
01:09:53,722 --> 01:09:54,898
Thank you.

897
01:09:55,101 --> 01:09:57,330
Siddharth, I loaned you 10
rupees last month...

898
01:09:57,587 --> 01:10:00,073
...for library subscription.
Give it back.

899
01:10:00,722 --> 01:10:02,695
- Right now?
- Definitely, right now.

900
01:10:04,338 --> 01:10:05,594
Take it.

901
01:10:06,658 --> 01:10:11,630
Somu, remember I had loaned you
10 bucks to watch a movie.

902
01:10:13,248 --> 01:10:15,632
Damn! Thank you.

903
01:10:16,697 --> 01:10:19,531
Omi, I had paid
your laundry bill.

904
01:10:19,611 --> 01:10:21,276
- Remember I pay that.
- Yes.

905
01:10:22,589 --> 01:10:25,334
Thank you. Thank you. Yeah.

906
01:10:25,826 --> 01:10:28,957
- Give some other note.
- I will give it tomorrow.

907
01:10:29,037 --> 01:10:30,717
No.. today this will be fine.

908
01:10:30,797 --> 01:10:31,702
By the way where are you both going?

909
01:10:31,782 --> 01:10:32,960
- On our hunt.
- Where?

910
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:36,672
Pretty girls roam around at
this time. We will just enjoy.

911
01:10:36,752 --> 01:10:40,838
Who are you telling? This poor
chap has nothing to do with girls.

912
01:10:49,130 --> 01:10:51,213
- Can I keep this Chamko down?
- Yes, sure.

913
01:10:55,227 --> 01:10:57,198
You look a changed person today.

914
01:10:57,392 --> 01:11:00,937
- Yes I did some shopping.
- The shirt, is it new?

915
01:11:02,977 --> 01:11:04,068
Shall I take the tag out?

916
01:11:04,148 --> 01:11:06,716
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

917
01:11:08,397 --> 01:11:11,405
I have brought you something.
Just see.

918
01:11:17,925 --> 01:11:19,597
- Bracelet?
- Yes.

919
01:11:19,677 --> 01:11:21,365
- Looks to be made of silver.
- Yes.

920
01:11:21,445 --> 01:11:23,054
- Must be very expensive.
- Yes.

921
01:11:25,095 --> 01:11:27,584
- I cannot take it.
- Wh.. why?

922
01:11:28,156 --> 01:11:32,432
- We are meeting just the second time--
- Third time.

923
01:11:32,512 --> 01:11:34,429
And you are giving me
such expensive gifts.

924
01:11:34,913 --> 01:11:37,500
What do you think of me?
I am not such type of girl.

925
01:11:37,580 --> 01:11:39,787
Please.. don't get annoyed.

926
01:11:40,042 --> 01:11:45,039
See, I had told you that I don't
have experience in these matters.

927
01:11:45,119 --> 01:11:47,505
I thought it will please you a lot...

928
01:11:47,585 --> 01:11:50,097
...but if it annoys you,
I will take it back.

929
01:11:50,713 --> 01:11:52,138
Please don't get angry.

930
01:12:03,562 --> 01:12:09,015
I will take ice cream,
Tutti-frutti, as usual. And you?

931
01:12:09,095 --> 01:12:11,223
<i>No.. you can be informal with me.</i>

932
01:12:11,591 --> 01:12:13,091
- I--
- Coffee!

933
01:12:24,394 --> 01:12:27,433
You smoke a lot!
You don't like cigarettes?

934
01:12:28,018 --> 01:12:31,970
No.. I like cigarettes a lot.
I mean its smell.

935
01:12:32,404 --> 01:12:33,848
Sometimes I too
feel like smoking.

936
01:12:33,928 --> 01:12:35,528
- No.. no.. not at all.
- Why?

937
01:12:35,698 --> 01:12:37,261
- Never?
- Why?

938
01:12:37,341 --> 01:12:39,150
What why?
Because I am telling you.

939
01:12:39,528 --> 01:12:42,713
- Hey, if I ask you will you quit smoking?
- Sure.

940
01:12:43,612 --> 01:12:46,754
- You can't quit, you're a chain smoker.
- Just say it and see.

941
01:12:47,433 --> 01:12:48,735
Said.

942
01:12:50,367 --> 01:12:51,820
Fine.. I have quit!

943
01:12:55,537 --> 01:12:56,782
What joke is this?

944
01:12:58,168 --> 01:13:03,159
I wished it was a joke, Lallan Miya.
But it's the bitter truth.

945
01:13:03,386 --> 01:13:05,839
You were supposed to get a
money order what about that?

946
01:13:08,028 --> 01:13:11,651
What to say, Lallan Miya,
I am deeply ashamed of my self.

947
01:13:11,906 --> 01:13:15,293
No, it is I who is ashamed who
kept faith in customers like you.

948
01:13:16,472 --> 01:13:23,566
How to tell you, Lallan Miya..
first time in my life.

949
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:28,588
- Lallan Miya, I have quit smoking.
- How come?

950
01:13:29,491 --> 01:13:32,213
You seem to have forgotten.
Don't you remember I'd told you?

951
01:13:32,293 --> 01:13:38,246
- That I would quit smoking when.. that--
- Girl! Right?

952
01:13:39,005 --> 01:13:42,917
- Vow, great! Congratulations!
- Thank you.

953
01:13:44,643 --> 01:13:46,633
But who will pay my money?

954
01:13:47,643 --> 01:13:50,628
I spent all that like a madman.

955
01:13:50,708 --> 01:13:54,672
Just see, all these are new.
But you do one thing.

956
01:13:55,010 --> 01:13:58,973
- What?
- Keep this. it's made of silver.

957
01:14:00,812 --> 01:14:03,963
Vow! Great!

958
01:14:05,915 --> 01:14:11,226
So I will tell my wife that when
I get money only then we can eat.

959
01:14:11,481 --> 01:14:13,338
For the time being
wear this ornament.

960
01:14:14,905 --> 01:14:18,000
I had heard that one
is deceived in love.

961
01:14:19,028 --> 01:14:21,038
Here, someone else is
in love and...

962
01:14:21,425 --> 01:14:24,246
...Its 'I' who is being deceived?
Just tell me!

963
01:14:38,951 --> 01:14:43,612
<i>"Awake, the sleeping ones."</i>

964
01:14:44,857 --> 01:14:50,008
<i>"Listen to my story."</i>

965
01:14:52,385 --> 01:14:56,885
<i>"Awake, the sleeping ones."</i>

966
01:14:57,234 --> 01:15:00,847
- What are you doing?
- I am applying. Today's the last date.

967
01:15:01,762 --> 01:15:04,554
How come you thought of this?

968
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:12,157
I can't see my
friends smoking bidis.

969
01:15:12,402 --> 01:15:15,203
As I get my first salary I will
get you Dunhill, right?

970
01:15:16,665 --> 01:15:21,532
He hasn't applies as yet and
already got his first salary.

971
01:15:21,612 --> 01:15:22,952
Very good.

972
01:15:23,032 --> 01:15:24,975
Let the call come.

973
01:15:25,296 --> 01:15:28,338
How will the job not come?
This job is meant for me.

974
01:15:28,578 --> 01:15:32,834
1st class with distinction, gold
medallist, dozens certificates.

975
01:15:33,023 --> 01:15:35,056
Age is proper and I can
speak English very well.

976
01:15:35,136 --> 01:15:37,675
Personality too is.. touchwood.

977
01:15:38,165 --> 01:15:40,108
What more does one need to get a job?

978
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:43,447
- Recommendation.
- Right.

979
01:15:44,126 --> 01:15:49,749
In this nation, though small a
leaf can turn. I've to prove it.

980
01:15:50,231 --> 01:15:53,051
They ask the same question
in every interview.

981
01:15:53,297 --> 01:15:55,504
I'm telling you,
there's no suspense here.

982
01:15:56,607 --> 01:15:59,164
- Sir, my documents.
- No, don't worry.

983
01:16:08,824 --> 01:16:10,984
Siddharth Parashar.

984
01:16:12,201 --> 01:16:15,909
Qualifications are interesting.
Not much experience.

985
01:16:16,220 --> 01:16:17,475
Good morning, sir.

986
01:16:19,041 --> 01:16:21,597
Yes, Mr. Parashar. Come in please.

987
01:16:22,088 --> 01:16:23,626
- Take a seat.
- Thank you, sir.

988
01:16:34,701 --> 01:16:36,484
What tranquility in
this garden, right?

989
01:16:37,918 --> 01:16:42,494
Actually we should sing now,
running around.

990
01:16:44,522 --> 01:16:46,768
What about people
sitting around?

991
01:16:47,372 --> 01:16:48,588
Look at the beautiful bear.

992
01:16:49,514 --> 01:16:56,958
He will go to his in-laws to
take his bride. Look at his gait.

993
01:16:57,898 --> 01:16:59,423
I want this one.

994
01:17:02,384 --> 01:17:05,187
When in movies the hero sings a
duet with the heroine...

995
01:17:05,267 --> 01:17:07,488
...there is no one except
them in the garden...

996
01:17:07,568 --> 01:17:09,380
Although the population
of our country is so much.

997
01:17:10,327 --> 01:17:13,683
Now tell me, from where does the
music starts playing in the garden?

998
01:17:13,890 --> 01:17:15,664
That too a 40 piece orchestra!

999
01:17:16,598 --> 01:17:20,179
How do they quickly think of
words that rhyme?

1000
01:17:20,603 --> 01:17:22,652
Everyone seems to be a poet!
Keeps singing.

1001
01:17:23,076 --> 01:17:26,605
Its not a difficult task, words
sometimes sound similar.

1002
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:29,433
Like 'pyaar'!

1003
01:17:31,856 --> 01:17:33,101
Bekarar!

1004
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:36,613
Intezaar!

1005
01:17:38,108 --> 01:17:39,293
Iqraar!

1006
01:17:42,191 --> 01:17:44,120
Tukde Hazaar! Baar Baar!

1007
01:17:46,731 --> 01:17:50,208
That's it, we have
learnt the poetry.

1008
01:17:53,953 --> 01:17:55,812
Did you heard some thing?

1009
01:17:56,806 --> 01:17:59,306
Music, but how come here?

1010
01:17:59,876 --> 01:18:01,104
Strange!

1011
01:18:04,321 --> 01:18:05,791
Is it some magic?

1012
01:18:11,664 --> 01:18:13,126
I think.

1013
01:18:13,869 --> 01:18:15,867
Even I think.

1014
01:18:16,162 --> 01:18:18,402
When you fall in
love with someone.

1015
01:18:18,482 --> 01:18:20,382
You start to hear
music all by itself.

1016
01:18:20,462 --> 01:18:22,466
And words start
pouring automatically.

1017
01:18:30,483 --> 01:18:31,650
Crazy!

1018
01:18:32,896 --> 01:18:33,890
Clouds!

1019
01:18:35,447 --> 01:18:38,622
- Collyrium!
- Anklets!

1020
01:18:45,473 --> 01:18:48,353
<i>"Such a crazy you are!"</i>

1021
01:18:50,688 --> 01:18:53,525
<i>"Just like this cloud!"</i>

1022
01:18:55,765 --> 01:19:00,652
<i>"What does the collyrium say?"</i>

1023
01:19:00,833 --> 01:19:04,742
<i>"Whatever the anklets sing."</i>

1024
01:19:08,270 --> 01:19:11,262
<i>"Such a crazy you are!"</i>

1025
01:19:13,241 --> 01:19:17,160
<i>"Just like this cloud!"</i>

1026
01:19:18,172 --> 01:19:22,124
<i>"What does the collyrium say?"</i>

1027
01:19:22,946 --> 01:19:26,363
<i>"Whatever the anklets sing."</i>

1028
01:19:32,909 --> 01:19:36,515
- Mad in love?
- Inebriated.

1029
01:19:38,254 --> 01:19:39,684
Stranger!

1030
01:19:40,644 --> 01:19:41,708
Known one.

1031
01:19:43,282 --> 01:19:47,944
<i>- "Heart is..
- Mad in love!"</i>

1032
01:19:48,212 --> 01:19:52,744
<i>- "Weather is..
- Inebriated."</i>

1033
01:19:53,177 --> 01:19:57,631
<i>- "Love is..
- A stranger!"</i>

1034
01:19:58,132 --> 01:20:02,655
<i>- "A friend is..
- Known one."</i>

1035
01:20:03,009 --> 01:20:05,846
<i>"Heart is mad in love!"</i>

1036
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:11,960
<i>"Weather is inebriated."</i>

1037
01:20:13,205 --> 01:20:17,988
<i>"Love is a stranger!"</i>

1038
01:20:18,195 --> 01:20:22,839
<i>"A friend is a known one."</i>

1039
01:20:48,621 --> 01:20:49,815
Everyone's!

1040
01:20:51,086 --> 01:20:52,314
Of the heart!

1041
01:20:53,775 --> 01:20:55,020
Wandered!

1042
01:20:56,152 --> 01:20:57,458
Got stuck!

1043
01:20:58,574 --> 01:21:03,322
<i>"This flower is of everyone!"</i>

1044
01:21:03,547 --> 01:21:08,165
<i>"But dear to the heart!"</i>

1045
01:21:08,468 --> 01:21:12,697
<i>"Wandered in the heart!"</i>

1046
01:21:13,380 --> 01:21:17,237
<i>"Got stuck on the eyelids!"</i>

1047
01:21:51,878 --> 01:21:53,441
Embrace!

1048
01:21:54,194 --> 01:21:56,028
Intoxicating!

1049
01:21:57,108 --> 01:21:58,648
Inebriated!

1050
01:21:59,676 --> 01:22:01,467
Silent!

1051
01:22:02,158 --> 01:22:07,139
<i>"Spring-like embrace."</i>

1052
01:22:07,219 --> 01:22:11,731
<i>"The ambience is intoxicating."</i>

1053
01:22:12,189 --> 01:22:16,470
<i>"Come, O my inebriated one."</i>

1054
01:22:17,197 --> 01:22:21,642
<i>"Let's be silent."</i>

1055
01:22:22,402 --> 01:22:26,572
<i>"Let's be silent."</i>

1056
01:22:28,474 --> 01:22:30,169
Aren't they embarrassed?

1057
01:22:30,249 --> 01:22:32,159
They sing songs in the park.

1058
01:23:09,990 --> 01:23:13,743
Lallan Miya, there is a
good news, very good news.

1059
01:23:13,823 --> 01:23:15,265
Have you come to pay my dues?

1060
01:23:15,542 --> 01:23:16,606
No, sir.

1061
01:23:17,453 --> 01:23:20,402
Good news for me will be when
you will pay my dues.

1062
01:23:20,584 --> 01:23:23,628
Have patience, I have got a job.

1063
01:23:24,390 --> 01:23:25,783
- Got a job?
- See this.

1064
01:23:26,076 --> 01:23:29,103
I am a small officer in a big
company from the first.

1065
01:23:29,285 --> 01:23:32,874
On my first pay I will pay
your dues with interest.

1066
01:23:33,722 --> 01:23:34,855
Congratulations, my friend.

1067
01:23:34,935 --> 01:23:36,351
Thank you.. thank you.

1068
01:23:38,487 --> 01:23:39,793
- Did you tell her?
- Who?

1069
01:23:40,139 --> 01:23:41,480
That special girl.

1070
01:23:42,093 --> 01:23:44,101
- She has gone on her soapy work.
- Is it?

1071
01:23:44,181 --> 01:23:46,461
- Omi and Somu are both missing.
- Is it?!

1072
01:23:46,541 --> 01:23:48,251
You are the first person
whom I told.

1073
01:23:48,450 --> 01:23:50,309
Okay wait.

1074
01:23:53,621 --> 01:23:57,263
- Take this, dear, a gift from me.
- Thanks.

1075
01:23:57,343 --> 01:24:00,931
- Now I should keep you happy.
- But I have quit.

1076
01:24:01,011 --> 01:24:03,422
- Fine then, give it back.
- No, it will come in use.

1077
01:24:04,038 --> 01:24:05,725
You will never refrain!

1078
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:08,552
Neha, I got a job.

1079
01:24:09,525 --> 01:24:10,606
- Congratulation, sir.
- Thank you.

1080
01:24:10,686 --> 01:24:12,751
- Waiter, a double Tutti-frutti.
- Okay.

1081
01:24:12,831 --> 01:24:14,230
I've got a job and not my salary.

1082
01:24:14,310 --> 01:24:17,404
So what, I am loaded with cash.
I've got my soap money.

1083
01:24:17,577 --> 01:24:18,771
'Long live Chamko.'

1084
01:24:18,851 --> 01:24:21,365
Look, Neha, no Chamko
from today.

1085
01:24:21,702 --> 01:24:23,691
- Why?
- Because I say so. That's all.

1086
01:24:24,409 --> 01:24:27,980
Who are you? I am your
would-be lord and master.

1087
01:24:28,060 --> 01:24:29,917
What? Who said?

1088
01:24:30,108 --> 01:24:32,278
I said. Even you said.

1089
01:24:32,875 --> 01:24:33,826
When did I say?

1090
01:24:33,906 --> 01:24:35,012
Did you even ask?

1091
01:24:35,092 --> 01:24:37,382
Why ask? Okay, I will ask you now?

1092
01:24:37,462 --> 01:24:38,696
Neha..

1093
01:24:44,179 --> 01:24:45,468
Will you marry me?

1094
01:24:48,486 --> 01:24:50,812
But I haven't
finished my studies.

1095
01:24:51,556 --> 01:24:53,373
I am not getting married to you tomorrow.

1096
01:24:53,453 --> 01:24:55,405
Let us just fix it?

1097
01:24:55,855 --> 01:24:57,689
You are a daughter
of a wealthy family.

1098
01:24:57,769 --> 01:24:59,695
You look okay too.

1099
01:25:00,318 --> 01:25:02,532
Who knows who may take you away?

1100
01:25:03,077 --> 01:25:05,914
I thought I will book you first.

1101
01:25:06,631 --> 01:25:09,157
So tell me, what is your answer?

1102
01:25:11,016 --> 01:25:14,485
See, this is the most
important decision of life.

1103
01:25:15,107 --> 01:25:16,724
How can I tell you so fast?

1104
01:25:17,433 --> 01:25:18,834
I need some time to think.

1105
01:25:23,945 --> 01:25:25,917
How much time do you need to think?

1106
01:25:28,028 --> 01:25:29,394
I need lots of time.

1107
01:25:29,558 --> 01:25:31,401
So when will you give the answer?

1108
01:25:34,298 --> 01:25:37,896
When I finish my Tuti-fruti.

1109
01:26:03,482 --> 01:26:06,059
<i>"Stop, my queen, stop."</i>

1110
01:26:06,778 --> 01:26:09,632
Hey Omi, Somu.

1111
01:26:10,237 --> 01:26:13,039
- Listen!
- Bone in the soup!

1112
01:26:13,119 --> 01:26:14,838
- Good news, my friends!
- What happened?

1113
01:26:14,918 --> 01:26:16,671
First have something bitter!

1114
01:26:18,877 --> 01:26:20,218
I got the job.

1115
01:26:20,298 --> 01:26:22,596
- Wow!
- What did I say?

1116
01:26:22,676 --> 01:26:24,611
You said recommendation is needed.

1117
01:26:25,631 --> 01:26:28,148
I had full confidence in you.
You are my true friend.

1118
01:26:28,580 --> 01:26:32,844
Now that I have got job I am
trying to do something special.

1119
01:26:33,294 --> 01:26:34,582
What do you mean?

1120
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:36,139
What do you mean?

1121
01:26:36,219 --> 01:26:37,462
I mean the same thing.

1122
01:26:37,912 --> 01:26:40,360
So now we have to find a girl for you?

1123
01:26:41,406 --> 01:26:43,603
Alright we will help.

1124
01:26:43,683 --> 01:26:46,396
No thanks, I have already got the girl.

1125
01:26:47,927 --> 01:26:49,080
Who is she? Where is she?

1126
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:51,118
Is she for real? Have we seen her?

1127
01:26:51,930 --> 01:26:56,272
You haven't seen her, but I
will introduce you to her. Surely!

1128
01:26:59,524 --> 01:27:00,709
Can you see this smoke?

1129
01:27:00,789 --> 01:27:02,436
It emanates directly
from the heart.

1130
01:27:03,118 --> 01:27:06,610
Who knows it is the heart or
the wound that is burning!

1131
01:27:07,149 --> 01:27:09,268
It is fire, somewhere.

1132
01:27:09,506 --> 01:27:11,841
Something like smoke!

1133
01:28:28,912 --> 01:28:35,883
<i>"Love has many names..."</i>

1134
01:28:35,963 --> 01:28:42,983
<i>"...but the story is the same,
yet each episode is new."</i>

1135
01:28:43,063 --> 01:28:44,831

1136
01:28:44,911 --> 01:28:46,604
<i>"There is nothing to say."</i>

1137
01:28:46,684 --> 01:28:48,351
<i>"There is nothing to say."</i>

1138
01:28:48,431 --> 01:28:50,080
<i>"There is nothing to say."</i>

1139
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:51,870
<i>"Is it something to stay mum?"</i>

1140
01:28:51,950 --> 01:28:58,971
<i>"Love has many names..."</i>

1141
01:28:59,051 --> 01:29:06,096

1143
01:29:32,884 --> 01:29:36,376
<i>"...and hides his

1145
01:29:40,064 --> 01:29:43,531

has become so formal."</i>

1146
01:29:43,611 --> 01:29:48,919

as a friend. Got it, dear?"</i>

1147
01:29:50,764 --> 01:29:57,829
<i>"Love has many names..."</i>

1148
01:29:57,909 --> 01:30:03,200
<i>"...but the story is the same,
yet each episode is new."</i>

1149
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:10,231

1150
01:30:10,311 --> 01:30:17,453

1151

1152

1153
01:30:57,345 --> 01:31:04,417
<i>"Is called insane."</i>

1154
01:31:04,645 --> 01:31:11,821
<i>"Is called insane."</i>

1155
01:31:11,901 --> 01:31:15,454
<i>"One of the three friends
has got a girl."</i>

1156
01:31:15,534 --> 01:31:18,956
<i>"The two have developed
hopes as well."</i>

1157
01:31:19,190 --> 01:31:22,762
<i>"One of the three friends
has got a girl."</i>

1158
01:31:22,842 --> 01:31:26,378
<i>"The two have developed
hopes as well."</i>

1159
01:31:26,458 --> 01:31:30,079
<i>"Fate will smile at us,
have you understood, dear?"</i>

1160
01:31:30,159 --> 01:31:31,982
<i>"Have you understood, dear?"</i>

1161
01:32:33,438 --> 01:32:39,621
53, 54, 55, 56, 57.

1162
01:32:39,701 --> 01:32:41,732
Son, you are going tomorrow
Packing is over or not?

1163
01:32:42,130 --> 01:32:43,669
He is not even bothered.

1164
01:32:43,851 --> 01:32:46,325
I have packed it for him.

1165
01:32:49,778 --> 01:32:52,241
Grandma, you always put warm
clothes.

1166
01:32:52,532 --> 01:32:54,089
Mumbai is not cold.

1167
01:32:54,462 --> 01:32:58,427
I will have to do the
packing on my own. Again!

1168
01:33:40,899 --> 01:33:43,191
- What is it?
- I want to talk to you.

1169
01:33:43,528 --> 01:33:45,094
Not now, I am reading.

1170
01:33:45,458 --> 01:33:47,507
You are always doing
something or the other.

1171
01:33:48,182 --> 01:33:49,514
This is something very special.

1172
01:33:51,382 --> 01:33:53,172
Tell me, what is special?

1173
01:33:53,389 --> 01:33:55,257
I want you to meet someone.

1174
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:56,935
Fine, bring him.

1175
01:33:58,397 --> 01:34:02,384
Oh Papa, he is someone very
special.

1176
01:34:03,249 --> 01:34:04,452
What do you mean?

1177
01:34:05,325 --> 01:34:08,543
Means that Neha is no
more a kid now.

1178
01:34:09,979 --> 01:34:11,138
What is all this?

1179
01:34:12,098 --> 01:34:15,852
I want you to meet my special friend.

1180
01:34:17,495 --> 01:34:20,263
Otherwise you will tell later that
I didn't introduce you to your son-in-law.

1181
01:34:20,591 --> 01:34:22,416
Son-in-law! Whose son-in law?

1182
01:34:22,727 --> 01:34:23,782
Yours!

1183
01:34:24,214 --> 01:34:25,338
What rubbish is she talking?

1184
01:34:25,658 --> 01:34:27,327
Who is he whom I have not seen even?

1185
01:34:27,407 --> 01:34:30,839
That is what she is
trying to say. Call him.

1186
01:34:31,349 --> 01:34:32,386
What rubbish is this?

1187
01:34:32,603 --> 01:34:33,796
Nothing like that happen.

1188
01:34:34,117 --> 01:34:35,535
I will get my own son-in-law.

1189
01:34:39,782 --> 01:34:41,364
But is that harm in meeting him once?

1190
01:34:41,987 --> 01:34:44,210
She is still small.
One who eats ice cream!

1191
01:34:44,452 --> 01:34:45,706
What are you saying?

1192
01:34:45,897 --> 01:34:47,514
Now she is not that small.

1193
01:34:47,594 --> 01:34:50,143
When I was of her age
you were in my lap.

1194
01:34:50,223 --> 01:34:52,210
- Those days are gone now.
- Is it?

1195
01:34:54,858 --> 01:34:59,502
Poor girl wants to call
him home and meet us.

1196
01:34:59,770 --> 01:35:02,607
You will realize if she
runs away someday.

1197
01:35:09,016 --> 01:35:10,850
I have a different plan for her.

1198
01:35:14,448 --> 01:35:15,823
Siddharth, one minute.

1199
01:35:20,268 --> 01:35:22,802
I wish you to visit
our place someday.

1200
01:35:24,318 --> 01:35:27,533
Why not, sir? I would be delighted.

1201
01:35:27,992 --> 01:35:29,696
Good. So when would you come?

1202
01:35:30,171 --> 01:35:31,477
What are you doing today evening?

1203
01:35:31,850 --> 01:35:34,998
Sir I will be able
to come only tomorrow.

1204
01:35:35,534 --> 01:35:37,454
Today evening, I am a bit busy.

1205
01:35:38,881 --> 01:35:43,473
Siddharth, have you seen that we
do not know each other well.

1206
01:35:44,097 --> 01:35:46,097
Why do you not come to my house?

1207
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:47,708
I have seen you, that's enough.

1208
01:35:48,259 --> 01:35:50,908
I want you to meet my father.

1209
01:35:50,988 --> 01:35:53,134
And my grandma and my brother as well.

1210
01:35:53,214 --> 01:35:54,648
I will meet everyone.

1211
01:35:54,728 --> 01:35:58,921
But let me get my first salary.
I will come with a sweet box.

1212
01:36:00,105 --> 01:36:02,120
I ought to meet your parents too.

1213
01:36:02,200 --> 01:36:03,798
You can see them for the
rest of the life throughout.

1214
01:36:04,075 --> 01:36:06,860
Once you meet them, you will
forget me. They are very good.

1215
01:36:07,188 --> 01:36:09,852
You can know that by seeing me.

1216
01:36:10,059 --> 01:36:12,524
I myself don't know
anything about your job.

1217
01:36:12,775 --> 01:36:15,888
Where and what do you work?

1218
01:36:15,968 --> 01:36:17,436
I will tell you everything.

1219
01:36:17,516 --> 01:36:21,311
Let me get my first salary and
let probation period get over.

1220
01:36:21,502 --> 01:36:22,497
I shall take you to my office.

1221
01:36:22,577 --> 01:36:24,900
We can take your grandma too.
No problem.

1222
01:36:25,610 --> 01:36:28,187
C'mon lets sit over there.

1223
01:36:28,879 --> 01:36:30,012
Okay.

1224
01:36:44,378 --> 01:36:46,056
There they are.

1225
01:36:50,830 --> 01:36:56,210
- What a cute kid! A lovable kid!
- What a sweet child.

1226
01:36:57,187 --> 01:36:59,003
- What is kid's name?
- Anjali.

1227
01:36:59,083 --> 01:37:01,391
- What's your name?
- Where does she stay?

1228
01:37:05,171 --> 01:37:07,532
What a sweet baby!

1229
01:37:09,783 --> 01:37:11,744
See the doggie.

1230
01:37:12,012 --> 01:37:15,569
See that doggie.

1231
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:19,633
Doggie is playing.

1232
01:37:20,499 --> 01:37:23,327
- It's such a nice park.
- You wore a cap.

1233
01:37:26,311 --> 01:37:29,209
Please hold the kid for a minute.
I will be back in five minutes.

1234
01:37:44,975 --> 01:37:47,760
I will not be able
to meet you tomorrow...

1235
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:49,040
...as my boss has asked me to
come to his house.

1236
01:37:49,120 --> 01:37:50,260
Why?

1237
01:37:50,821 --> 01:37:52,914
He is quite impressed by me.

1238
01:37:53,503 --> 01:37:55,284
Does he have a daughter?

1239
01:37:56,366 --> 01:37:58,701
Even I can't meet you tomorrow.

1240
01:37:58,952 --> 01:38:01,053
- I'm too busy.
- Why can't you come then?

1241
01:38:01,589 --> 01:38:04,417
An important guest of my
father is expected tomorrow.

1242
01:38:04,762 --> 01:38:06,890
What's your business with the guest?

1243
01:38:06,970 --> 01:38:08,472
Dad asked to come early.

1244
01:38:09,761 --> 01:38:11,517
Is it that someone is coming
to see you?

1245
01:38:11,597 --> 01:38:12,428
Come on.

1246
01:38:12,508 --> 01:38:14,546
- Tell me. Come on, tell me.
- You blabber anything.

1247
01:38:46,654 --> 01:38:47,813
Damn!

1248
01:38:57,716 --> 01:39:01,920
Siddharth with a girl.

1249
01:39:03,702 --> 01:39:05,864
Hey, she's a real girl.

1250
01:39:06,426 --> 01:39:09,782
It's the girl we saw the other day.

1251
01:39:12,497 --> 01:39:13,777
Yes. it's that same girl.

1252
01:39:17,549 --> 01:39:23,101
<i>"A friend betrayed me."</i>

1253
01:39:24,148 --> 01:39:29,390
<i>"My lover betrayed me."</i>

1254
01:39:30,272 --> 01:39:38,221
<i>"Life, I don't believe you."</i>

1255
01:39:38,301 --> 01:39:40,322
She is the one whom I saw
from top of the building...

1256
01:39:40,402 --> 01:39:43,997
...I sang duet with her and
we went on boating.

1257
01:39:44,077 --> 01:39:47,223
She is the one with whom I sang
duet and talked about love.

1258
01:39:49,644 --> 01:39:51,746
We should save our
friend from this girl.

1259
01:39:52,171 --> 01:39:53,433
It's our duty.

1260
01:39:54,273 --> 01:39:57,205
As friend in need
is friend indeed.

1261
01:39:57,559 --> 01:40:00,111
And we are true friends.

1262
01:40:23,633 --> 01:40:25,726
I was going to tell you
this beautiful secret.

1263
01:40:28,217 --> 01:40:30,673
She is my..

1264
01:40:33,268 --> 01:40:34,401
She is Neha.

1265
01:40:36,373 --> 01:40:37,523
How is she?

1266
01:40:39,607 --> 01:40:41,233
Why what's wrong?

1267
01:40:43,524 --> 01:40:48,515
As a friend I would like to
tell you that be careful.

1268
01:40:49,302 --> 01:40:50,106
Why?

1269
01:40:50,186 --> 01:40:53,012
Stay away from this girl, or
else you will repent later.

1270
01:40:54,914 --> 01:40:57,621
What do you mean?

1271
01:40:57,846 --> 01:41:00,060
I mean that
you have fallen for a wrong girl.

1272
01:41:03,581 --> 01:41:04,740
Do you know her?

1273
01:41:05,925 --> 01:41:08,087
Who does not know her?
She is a big flirt.

1274
01:41:08,167 --> 01:41:10,042
Don't get angry.

1275
01:41:10,327 --> 01:41:12,360
She is the same girl whom I had dated..

1276
01:41:12,440 --> 01:41:14,994
...and sang duet in the park too--

1277
01:41:16,118 --> 01:41:17,707
Aren't you ashamed
to speak such things?

1278
01:41:17,787 --> 01:41:20,896
Please do not hit me. I have
gone to her house also.

1279
01:41:21,330 --> 01:41:23,449
Even I didn't go to her house,
then how can you?

1280
01:41:23,529 --> 01:41:25,498
If you don't trust me then go
and have a look.

1281
01:41:26,104 --> 01:41:29,044
She has a green ash tray.

1282
01:41:29,207 --> 01:41:32,468
And her mother's photograph is hanging on
the wall. There is a garland on it too.

1283
01:41:33,108 --> 01:41:35,729
I am swearing that I had
gone to her house.

1284
01:41:37,934 --> 01:41:39,309
Run!

1285
01:41:57,849 --> 01:41:58,905
What's it?

1286
01:41:58,985 --> 01:42:01,430
You've started with these pin ups.

1287
01:42:01,510 --> 01:42:02,962
This is not a pin up.

1288
01:42:03,161 --> 01:42:05,964
She is Neha, my friend.

1289
01:42:07,131 --> 01:42:08,541
My wife to-be.

1290
01:42:09,042 --> 01:42:10,417
Now do you also have
anything to say?

1291
01:42:12,977 --> 01:42:14,871
I cannot ditch my friend.

1292
01:42:18,926 --> 01:42:19,921
What do you mean?

1293
01:42:20,898 --> 01:42:23,345
If you are ready to listen to me
patiently then I will tell you.

1294
01:42:26,614 --> 01:42:27,582
Tell me.

1295
01:42:27,937 --> 01:42:29,641
My friend, this girl is a flirt.

1296
01:42:30,609 --> 01:42:32,148
She has fooled many.

1297
01:42:33,333 --> 01:42:34,474
Including me.

1298
01:42:35,010 --> 01:42:37,899
She goes around with everyone.

1299
01:42:37,979 --> 01:42:40,424
Makes sweet promises.

1300
01:42:41,765 --> 01:42:43,200
She is very smart.

1301
01:42:43,650 --> 01:42:45,639
What a sweet poetry was it.

1302
01:42:46,209 --> 01:42:48,743
What shall I keep in my heart...

1303
01:42:48,925 --> 01:42:51,416
...so that you don't enter it.

1304
01:42:53,465 --> 01:42:55,264
Why shall I bother?
You too go and get fooled.

1305
01:42:55,344 --> 01:42:57,590
You don't trust your friends,
your well wishers.

1306
01:42:57,670 --> 01:42:59,130
I had been to her house.

1307
01:43:00,505 --> 01:43:03,852
I had gone to her bedroom
and her bathroom as well.

1308
01:43:03,932 --> 01:43:09,846
There is a green flower printed
curtain hanging in her bathroom.

1309
01:43:10,348 --> 01:43:13,383
Save please. Save please.

1310
01:43:14,153 --> 01:43:15,303
Save.

1311
01:43:21,530 --> 01:43:22,533
- Hello!
- Hello!

1312
01:43:22,613 --> 01:43:24,202
- Yes Neha.
- Is it Siddharth?

1313
01:43:25,033 --> 01:43:26,062
Come on tell me.

1314
01:43:27,887 --> 01:43:29,651
- How are you?
- I am fine.

1315
01:43:29,971 --> 01:43:31,814
But you sound worried.

1316
01:43:34,105 --> 01:43:37,357
Yes. I was bit disturbed.

1317
01:43:37,755 --> 01:43:39,493
Now I feel better after speaking to you.

1318
01:43:41,621 --> 01:43:43,964
It would have been nice if we
could meet in the evening.

1319
01:43:44,044 --> 01:43:46,519
A little bit of separation is good.

1320
01:43:47,107 --> 01:43:49,788
Today you go and please your boss. Okay.

1321
01:43:51,949 --> 01:43:54,553
- Fine. Bye!
- Bye!

1322
01:44:03,649 --> 01:44:05,777
- Good evening.
- Hello, Siddharth! Welcome.

1323
01:44:06,546 --> 01:44:07,549
Welcome.

1324
01:44:07,629 --> 01:44:08,838
- How are you?
- Fine.

1325
01:44:09,340 --> 01:44:12,004
The tender from Agarwal and Co. has arrived.

1326
01:44:12,471 --> 01:44:15,325
- And there is an order from Calcutta--
- Listen.

1327
01:44:15,584 --> 01:44:17,452
No official matters here at
home. Is it fine?

1328
01:44:17,532 --> 01:44:18,810
- No shop talk.
- Sure sir.

1329
01:44:18,890 --> 01:44:22,070
I want to introduce you to my family.

1330
01:44:22,399 --> 01:44:24,284
- Come on let's go in.
- Fine sir.

1331
01:44:38,218 --> 01:44:41,262
This Zen philosophy is very
strange.

1332
01:44:42,387 --> 01:44:43,658
Do you read Zen?

1333
01:44:44,082 --> 01:44:45,258
Little bit.

1334
01:44:45,338 --> 01:44:47,048
Nowadays youngsters don't read much.

1335
01:44:47,403 --> 01:44:49,158
They just like movies.

1336
01:44:49,331 --> 01:44:51,770
I too don't find enough time to read.

1337
01:44:53,206 --> 01:44:54,530
She is my mother.

1338
01:44:54,962 --> 01:44:56,216
The boss of this house.

1339
01:45:01,104 --> 01:45:02,955
- You!
- You!

1340
01:45:05,021 --> 01:45:07,892
Do you both know each other?

1341
01:45:08,222 --> 01:45:10,730
Dad, I had told you about him.

1342
01:45:11,050 --> 01:45:13,688
He is that same person.

1343
01:45:13,990 --> 01:45:17,398
I see. My Goodness!

1344
01:45:18,505 --> 01:45:20,901
Truth is stranger
than fiction, isn't it?

1345
01:45:20,981 --> 01:45:23,461
Let's have some tea.

1346
01:45:27,647 --> 01:45:28,676
Thank you.

1347
01:45:34,886 --> 01:45:36,815
- Siddharth, give me that ash tray.
- Sure, sir.

1348
01:45:38,026 --> 01:45:39,514
This is Neha's mother.

1349
01:45:39,963 --> 01:45:43,500
And there is a garland on her
mother's photograph.

1350
01:45:45,447 --> 01:45:46,822
What have you done?

1351
01:45:46,902 --> 01:45:49,694
Go to bathroom and clean it,
or else your clothes will get stained.

1352
01:45:57,391 --> 01:45:58,706
I had been to her bathroom too.

1353
01:45:58,786 --> 01:46:00,107
Don't believe then go
and see for yourself.

1354
01:46:00,187 --> 01:46:04,570
It's a plastic curtain
with green flowers on it.

1355
01:46:20,620 --> 01:46:21,987
Neha dear, the tea.

1356
01:46:30,331 --> 01:46:31,386
Take this.

1357
01:46:32,571 --> 01:46:33,670
Thank you, sir.

1358
01:46:39,196 --> 01:46:41,488
- Is the tea cold?
- No.

1359
01:46:46,314 --> 01:46:49,332
Excuse me, sir. I have an
important work to attend.

1360
01:46:49,412 --> 01:46:50,578
At least eat this cake.

1361
01:46:50,658 --> 01:46:53,267
- Neha has prepared herself.
- No, please.

1362
01:46:59,252 --> 01:47:00,723
Siddharth, listen to me.

1363
01:47:01,164 --> 01:47:03,689
- What happened? Please wait.
- Don't dare to follow me.

1364
01:47:04,052 --> 01:47:05,886
Don't dare to bring my
name on your lips

1365
01:47:07,140 --> 01:47:08,948
God save me from girls like you.

1366
01:47:09,554 --> 01:47:11,378
I am lucky to be saved on time.

1367
01:47:12,573 --> 01:47:14,458
Now find someone else to fool around with.

1368
01:47:15,332 --> 01:47:16,664
Have you gone mad?

1369
01:47:16,744 --> 01:47:19,302
Yes, I had. But now I am in my senses.

1370
01:47:20,886 --> 01:47:24,311
Don't you try to come
in front of me ever!

1371
01:48:08,095 --> 01:48:13,526
<i>"From where do the clouds arrive?"</i>

1372
01:48:21,838 --> 01:48:26,950
<i>"From where do the clouds arrive?"</i>

1373
01:48:27,702 --> 01:48:32,441
<i>"They melt the collyrium away."</i>

1374
01:48:32,787 --> 01:48:37,993
<i>"From where do the clouds arrive?"</i>

1375
01:48:38,616 --> 01:48:43,676
<i>"They melt the collyrium away."</i>

1376
01:48:43,756 --> 01:48:48,648
<i>"From where do the clouds arrive?"</i>

1377
01:49:08,670 --> 01:49:18,521
<i>"The sleep has gone with the beloved."</i>

1378
01:49:19,521 --> 01:49:21,691
Why have you stopped? Sing.

1379
01:49:22,530 --> 01:49:32,415
<i>"The sleep has gone with the beloved."</i>

1380
01:49:33,538 --> 01:49:43,415
<i>"The garden of dreams
has withered away."</i>

1381
01:49:44,530 --> 01:49:54,226
<i>"The garden of dreams
has withered away."</i>

1382
01:49:54,306 --> 01:50:03,064
<i>"As if the ambrosia, with the
onset of the monsoon."</i>

1383
01:50:03,144 --> 01:50:08,545
<i>"From where do the clouds arrive?"</i>

1384
01:50:08,967 --> 01:50:14,037
<i>"They melt the collyrium away."</i>

1385
01:50:14,117 --> 01:50:20,307
<i>"From where do the clouds arrive?"</i>

1386
01:50:33,089 --> 01:50:42,969
<i>"The heavier clouds have
enveloped the heart."</i>

1387
01:50:52,256 --> 01:51:01,931
<i>"The heavier clouds have
enveloped the heart."</i>

1388
01:51:03,109 --> 01:51:12,796
<i>"The heartless breeze inflames the fire."</i>

1389
01:51:14,029 --> 01:51:23,564
<i>"The heartless breeze inflames the fire."</i>

1390
01:51:23,797 --> 01:51:30,293
<i>"The heart cries getting
inspired by the rain."</i>

1391
01:51:30,373 --> 01:51:32,564
<i>"The heart is absurd!"</i>

1392
01:51:32,644 --> 01:51:34,715
<i>"From where do--"</i>

1393
01:52:34,815 --> 01:52:35,853
Sir.

1394
01:52:36,892 --> 01:52:38,924
The boss has called you inside.

1395
01:52:49,055 --> 01:52:50,244
Okay.

1396
01:52:52,482 --> 01:52:54,687
- You called me, sir.
- Yes, Siddharth.

1397
01:52:55,044 --> 01:52:57,293
Are you through with the
Tanzania project report?

1398
01:52:59,955 --> 01:53:01,027
No, sir.

1399
01:53:01,780 --> 01:53:03,423
What about the Hussain and Co. tender?

1400
01:53:07,530 --> 01:53:09,389
Did you get in touch in
London, over the phone?

1401
01:53:15,175 --> 01:53:16,403
What is the matter, Siddharth?

1402
01:53:17,926 --> 01:53:19,673
Tell me, Come on.

1403
01:53:20,996 --> 01:53:23,470
Sit down.

1404
01:53:29,531 --> 01:53:30,664
Sir.

1405
01:53:31,849 --> 01:53:34,236
Instead of you dismissing me...

1406
01:53:36,302 --> 01:53:37,885
...I would like to resign.

1407
01:53:42,987 --> 01:53:44,380
I cannot work any more.

1408
01:53:53,997 --> 01:53:57,940
You are obviously undergoing
some emotional crisis.

1409
01:53:59,333 --> 01:54:01,140
I will keep this letter with me.

1410
01:54:02,810 --> 01:54:04,764
I will keep it with me for a month.

1411
01:54:06,018 --> 01:54:09,581
Even after that, if
you are sure about it...

1412
01:54:10,377 --> 01:54:11,761
...then I will take
the adequate action.

1413
01:54:19,665 --> 01:54:23,462
You can go on leave from
tomorrow, without fail.

1414
01:54:25,994 --> 01:54:27,180
Yes, sir.

1415
01:54:34,487 --> 01:54:36,710
Omi, have a look
at this handkerchief.

1416
01:54:36,790 --> 01:54:40,213
It's a lady's handkerchief.

1417
01:54:41,926 --> 01:54:43,621
You are getting smarter.

1418
01:54:43,837 --> 01:54:47,166
- We'll hunt with this.
- Hunt, but how?

1419
01:54:47,451 --> 01:54:51,888
Hey! I had seen it in a movie.
It happens so that--

1420
01:54:53,704 --> 01:54:57,571
Amitabh, in park.. and then--

1421
01:55:11,899 --> 01:55:15,609
Excuse me. I think you
dropped your handkerchief.

1422
01:55:16,259 --> 01:55:19,407
You are mistaken. It's not mine.

1423
01:55:19,796 --> 01:55:22,304
Yes, its possible that I am
mistaken, but I feel that...

1424
01:55:22,384 --> 01:55:23,654
...It has fallen off from your purse.

1425
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,802
But my purse is closed, look here.

1426
01:55:27,217 --> 01:55:31,187
Listen, look..
Its a beautiful handkerchief...

1427
01:55:31,267 --> 01:55:32,839
...and what's the use if I keep it?

1428
01:55:33,635 --> 01:55:35,468
Also I cannot throw
it on the road.

1429
01:55:35,548 --> 01:55:37,154
Then give it to any beautiful lady.

1430
01:55:37,234 --> 01:55:38,322
That's what I am doing.

1431
01:55:38,402 --> 01:55:39,558
- What?
- Yes, that's it.

1432
01:55:39,638 --> 01:55:40,881
Please show your hand.

1433
01:55:41,487 --> 01:55:44,116
Now it's looking good in your hand.

1434
01:55:45,673 --> 01:55:48,432
- Do you come here frequently?
- Sometimes.

1435
01:55:48,512 --> 01:55:50,180
- And you?
- I too come here often.

1436
01:55:50,439 --> 01:55:53,760
I come and here and think..
It's so beautiful.

1437
01:55:53,925 --> 01:55:55,169
- What?
- Your smile.

1438
01:55:55,249 --> 01:55:56,070
What?

1439
01:55:56,150 --> 01:55:57,817
By the way,
what are you doing this evening?

1440
01:55:57,897 --> 01:55:58,716
I won't tell you.

1441
01:55:58,796 --> 01:56:01,908
- You have to tell me.
- I won't tell you.

1442
01:56:02,228 --> 01:56:05,246
Do you think your plan
will be successful?

1443
01:56:05,326 --> 01:56:07,738
Yes, most certainly.

1444
01:56:08,187 --> 01:56:10,444
- I have spent Rs. 6.50 for it.
- Really.

1445
01:56:10,858 --> 01:56:12,207
Look, there goes the prey.

1446
01:56:12,743 --> 01:56:16,730
You hide and watch the fun now.

1447
01:56:16,810 --> 01:56:17,950
Okay.

1448
01:56:23,814 --> 01:56:25,025
Excuse me, miss.

1449
01:56:25,855 --> 01:56:27,161
I think this
handkerchief belongs to you.

1450
01:56:27,241 --> 01:56:28,484
It might have fallen
down from your purse.

1451
01:56:33,527 --> 01:56:35,239
Your handkerchief has flown away.

1452
01:56:37,999 --> 01:56:40,732
Handkerchief worth Rs. 6.50.

1453
01:56:53,376 --> 01:56:55,063
Hey, Siddharth, its 9.00 O'clock.

1454
01:56:55,143 --> 01:56:56,463
Won't you go to the office?

1455
01:56:57,372 --> 01:56:58,644
- No.
- What do you mean?

1456
01:57:00,460 --> 01:57:01,766
I am resigning from my job.

1457
01:57:04,334 --> 01:57:06,349
We are going to have idlis for
the breakfast.

1458
01:57:06,429 --> 01:57:08,407
- Yes.
- Get ready soon.

1459
01:57:09,185 --> 01:57:10,811
You all go, I am not hungry.

1460
01:57:11,339 --> 01:57:13,311
You had not eaten properly yesterday too.

1461
01:57:13,391 --> 01:57:15,421
- Come on get up.
- I told you that I am not hungry.

1462
01:57:24,245 --> 01:57:29,599
Listen to the song from the film 'Dosti'
sung by Mohammed Rafi.

1463
01:57:29,777 --> 01:57:30,812
The people who requested it are--

1464
01:57:30,892 --> 01:57:35,519
What ever we did was
not proper at all.

1465
01:57:36,426 --> 01:57:38,225
We crossed our limits.

1466
01:57:39,661 --> 01:57:42,203
I didn't expect that it will
become such a serious matter.

1467
01:57:43,112 --> 01:57:47,453
Yes it's true. We suffer
heartbreaks 100 times a day.

1468
01:57:48,258 --> 01:57:49,901
But we never lose heart.

1469
01:57:51,500 --> 01:57:53,852
But Siddharth, has had
a serious heart fail.

1470
01:57:54,285 --> 01:57:55,790
Its not heart fail you ass,
its heartbreak.

1471
01:57:56,210 --> 01:57:57,312
It's the same.

1472
01:57:59,578 --> 01:58:01,533
Brother! Clean the table soon
and bring two coffee, fast.

1473
01:58:01,613 --> 01:58:06,086
From Sundar's family and his friend's
Sudhanshu, Om Prakash, Hirendra...

1474
01:58:06,166 --> 01:58:07,755
...Vivek and Mr. Anup.

1475
01:58:08,020 --> 01:58:12,751
Let me tell you, that story
I told you about that girl--

1476
01:58:12,831 --> 01:58:17,299
- That lake, that mirror.
- It was all a lie.

1477
01:58:17,379 --> 01:58:18,493
It was a lie?

1478
01:58:23,630 --> 01:58:25,230
I mean then you.

1479
01:58:29,243 --> 01:58:30,653
The dosa is ready.

1480
01:58:31,942 --> 01:58:39,917
<i>"My every step is on your way--"</i>

1481
01:58:39,997 --> 01:58:43,279
- Now it's too much.
- But then what can we do now?

1482
01:58:44,598 --> 01:58:46,198
We will tell him the truth.

1483
01:58:47,041 --> 01:58:49,409
He won't spare us then.

1484
01:58:52,069 --> 01:58:56,793
<i>"Wherever you are--"</i>

1485
01:58:56,873 --> 01:59:06,116
<i>"Wherever you are,
you are in front of me."</i>

1486
01:59:06,607 --> 01:59:11,044
<i>"My every step is--"</i>

1487
01:59:12,826 --> 01:59:17,115
What's the matter, dear?
You are not ready for your class.

1488
01:59:17,360 --> 01:59:19,141
I am not going for
my class today, grandma.

1489
01:59:19,221 --> 01:59:20,888
Not going to the
class. But why?

1490
01:59:21,165 --> 01:59:22,505
I am having a headache.

1491
01:59:23,292 --> 01:59:25,247
Hmm, headache.

1492
01:59:39,483 --> 01:59:41,835
Siddharth, where is your lighter?

1493
01:59:43,106 --> 01:59:44,378
It might be lying
somewhere in the drawer.

1494
01:59:48,365 --> 01:59:50,112
Hey, poison!

1495
01:59:52,984 --> 01:59:54,290
Omi, come here.

1496
02:00:07,635 --> 02:00:10,757
Siddharth, we need to talk
something very important.

1497
02:00:12,816 --> 02:00:15,548
- Now what do you want to talk?
- It's very important.

1498
02:00:15,773 --> 02:00:17,555
It's a matter of life and death.

1499
02:00:19,162 --> 02:00:20,061
Please say!

1500
02:00:21,791 --> 02:00:25,804
Everything that we told you
related to that girl, I mean Neha...

1501
02:00:27,361 --> 02:00:28,564
...it was all a lie.

1502
02:00:32,570 --> 02:00:33,649
What do you mean?

1503
02:00:33,815 --> 02:00:36,881
We mean to say that,
it was true that we went to her house...

1504
02:00:37,358 --> 02:00:39,026
...but rest everything was a lie.

1505
02:00:39,745 --> 02:00:41,523
It happened so that--

1506
02:01:50,007 --> 02:01:54,193
Neha, I regret for that day.

1507
02:02:04,772 --> 02:02:07,003
Come in through the door.

1508
02:02:07,083 --> 02:02:10,541
- Why are you breaking the glass?
- Grandma, I don't want to see him.

1509
02:02:10,929 --> 02:02:12,693
Ask him not to come here again.

1510
02:02:34,104 --> 02:02:35,325
Hello.

1511
02:02:36,179 --> 02:02:38,244
Neha, I am Siddharth.

1512
02:02:51,231 --> 02:02:52,744
He is here.

1513
02:02:53,868 --> 02:02:55,522
- What happened?
- You are friends now?

1514
02:03:03,068 --> 02:03:05,327
- What happened?
- What happened?

1515
02:03:05,407 --> 02:03:07,252
Tell us what happened?

1516
02:03:11,716 --> 02:03:13,835
Come, come.

1517
02:03:15,382 --> 02:03:17,684
Because of you both, she is not
even ready to look at my face.

1518
02:03:17,764 --> 02:03:20,635
- You don't worry, we will think of a way.
- Yes.

1519
02:03:20,715 --> 02:03:23,022
- We will help you.
- Friends, please have mercy on me.

1520
02:03:23,102 --> 02:03:28,359
I beg of you, don't do anything
to show you friendship now.

1521
02:03:28,679 --> 02:03:31,248
I will sort out all my problems myself.

1522
02:03:31,328 --> 02:03:33,704
- By consuming poison.
- What?

1523
02:03:33,886 --> 02:03:36,411
Why did you bring that bottle of poison?

1524
02:03:36,491 --> 02:03:37,985
To kill the bugs.

1525
02:03:38,607 --> 02:03:39,688
Oh no!

1526
02:03:41,617 --> 02:03:42,758
Come in.

1527
02:03:44,765 --> 02:03:46,036
- Sir.
- You?

1528
02:03:46,555 --> 02:03:49,669
Sir, have you accepted my
resignation letter?

1529
02:03:50,455 --> 02:03:51,744
Not yet.

1530
02:03:52,695 --> 02:03:55,376
Please return it to me, sir.
I want to tear it.

1531
02:03:59,848 --> 02:04:01,907
I want to speak something
important about Neha with you.

1532
02:04:01,987 --> 02:04:04,778
Personal matter not to be
discussed in the office, okay?

1533
02:04:05,470 --> 02:04:06,724
Now resume your work.

1534
02:04:07,494 --> 02:04:08,558
Yes sir.

1535
02:04:10,053 --> 02:04:11,238
Thank you, sir.

1536
02:04:16,747 --> 02:04:18,182
- Yes, give that.
- Here, take it.

1537
02:04:18,580 --> 02:04:20,648
- Good bye.
- You tell him.

1538
02:04:20,925 --> 02:04:23,390
Good Morning, Lallan Miya.
How are you?

1539
02:04:23,727 --> 02:04:27,186
Till now I was fine, but now I
feel like I have a headache.

1540
02:04:29,451 --> 02:04:33,326
Dear Lallan Miya, we need a
packet of cigarette, on credit.

1541
02:04:33,741 --> 02:04:35,220
Aren't you ashamed?

1542
02:04:35,300 --> 02:04:38,186
Come on Lallan Miya, one shouldn't
feel ashamed of with dear ones.

1543
02:04:38,266 --> 02:04:40,131
You enter into our account.

1544
02:04:40,211 --> 02:04:42,224
Now Siddharth has a job.

1545
02:04:42,304 --> 02:04:44,498
- Yes.
- Huh! Siddharth has a job.

1546
02:04:44,578 --> 02:04:48,010
You haven't paid up the previous
dues and want to open account.

1547
02:04:48,174 --> 02:04:50,077
God save me from you rogues.

1548
02:04:50,310 --> 02:04:53,216
Your abuses too are very
pleasant and sweet...

1549
02:04:53,718 --> 02:04:57,134
...I am ready to die for you, so
once again say something to me.

1550
02:04:57,411 --> 02:05:00,273
If you like my
abuses so much then...

1551
02:05:00,671 --> 02:05:03,266
...this lane leads
straight to your house.

1552
02:05:03,836 --> 02:05:06,189
At least give one cigarette.

1553
02:05:06,269 --> 02:05:08,084
I won't give anything.

1554
02:05:08,164 --> 02:05:09,597
You cheats!

1555
02:05:10,461 --> 02:05:13,583
Just imagine how I reacted,
when he was showering...

1556
02:05:13,663 --> 02:05:17,942
..his abuses on me. I just
bowed down and saluted him.

1557
02:05:18,392 --> 02:05:21,904
- Cigarette.
- Cigarette. Take it.

1558
02:05:22,164 --> 02:05:26,185
- Naughty.
- Wow! You killed me as well as spared me.

1559
02:05:26,265 --> 02:05:31,375
- You have done such a favor to us.
- Thank you, Lallan Miya.

1560
02:05:52,756 --> 02:05:54,291
What are you doing, dear.

1561
02:05:55,556 --> 02:05:57,146
I am studying, grandma.

1562
02:05:57,621 --> 02:06:01,275
But it's an hour now. You
haven't turned the page yet.

1563
02:06:17,297 --> 02:06:19,297
Someone has cast his evil eye on her.

1564
02:06:29,876 --> 02:06:31,390
This house is such a pain.

1565
02:06:37,936 --> 02:06:39,051
What a problem?

1566
02:06:48,132 --> 02:06:49,018
O God!

1567
02:06:58,195 --> 02:06:59,460
O God!

1568
02:07:01,298 --> 02:07:03,017
My legs will break apart.

1569
02:07:09,730 --> 02:07:12,973
- Does Siddharth reside here?
- Yes, he resides here.

1570
02:07:14,811 --> 02:07:17,103
But at this moment he
is in the office.

1571
02:07:17,632 --> 02:07:19,265
Then son I will wait for him.

1572
02:07:19,345 --> 02:07:21,233
I can't climb the stairs again.

1573
02:07:28,660 --> 02:07:29,882
Please have a seat.

1574
02:07:57,481 --> 02:08:00,205
Son! You have put up
so many photographs.

1575
02:08:00,605 --> 02:08:02,648
You could have put up one
photograph of the Almighty!

1576
02:08:11,600 --> 02:08:13,114
Son, help me.

1577
02:08:17,071 --> 02:08:18,325
Wait.

1578
02:08:28,422 --> 02:08:30,346
This is my Neha's photograph.

1579
02:08:30,562 --> 02:08:33,103
Do you know her?

1580
02:08:33,183 --> 02:08:34,108
What do you mean?

1581
02:08:34,188 --> 02:08:36,681
She is my grand daughter
and I am her grandma.

1582
02:08:37,342 --> 02:08:40,726
- Grandma!
- Grandma! We've a small request.

1583
02:08:40,806 --> 02:08:43,342
You will have to accept it.

1584
02:08:43,422 --> 02:08:45,970
Just listen to us once.

1585
02:08:46,250 --> 02:08:49,558
I am repenting now, as I had
listened to your talks.

1586
02:08:50,510 --> 02:08:52,197
Just for the last time.

1587
02:08:52,424 --> 02:08:54,326
This is the only way to win back Neha.

1588
02:08:54,406 --> 02:08:57,202
This way is that of love, understood.

1589
02:08:58,294 --> 02:09:01,029
In the evening at 5.30 pm,
you come and hide yourself at...

1590
02:09:01,109 --> 02:09:02,564
...the temple on that hill.

1591
02:09:02,953 --> 02:09:04,423
You must bring a motorbike along with you.

1592
02:09:04,503 --> 02:09:05,677
Motorbike, what for?

1593
02:09:05,757 --> 02:09:07,893
Don't ask questions.
Do as we say.

1594
02:09:08,099 --> 02:09:10,390
If this plan does
not work then...

1595
02:09:10,470 --> 02:09:14,163
- then.. I--
- You will stop smoking.

1596
02:09:15,417 --> 02:09:17,558
What is all this commotion?
What am I supposed to do?

1597
02:09:17,638 --> 02:09:19,169
Stand outside the temple
and sing devotional hymns.

1598
02:09:19,249 --> 02:09:21,407
You need to show your
courage, dear friend.

1599
02:09:21,752 --> 02:09:23,514
It's the only way to win a girl.

1600
02:09:24,001 --> 02:09:26,477
You will come to know
everything.

1601
02:09:26,557 --> 02:09:27,914
Love will win.

1602
02:09:29,439 --> 02:09:30,347
Sorry.

1603
02:09:30,427 --> 02:09:34,473
You both leave now.
Let me work. C'mon, go now.

1604
02:09:34,553 --> 02:09:36,433
Come, let's go.

1605
02:09:36,887 --> 02:09:41,870
So you are coming to that temple
on the hill, at 5.30 pm. Sharp.

1606
02:09:42,173 --> 02:09:43,384
No.

1607
02:09:54,995 --> 02:09:57,676
The car is not to be seen.

1608
02:09:58,097 --> 02:09:59,806
I sent it back.

1609
02:09:59,886 --> 02:10:02,011
But why? How will we go back now?

1610
02:10:02,444 --> 02:10:04,303
We will take a cab.

1611
02:10:04,573 --> 02:10:06,281
How will
we get a cab at such a place?

1612
02:10:06,660 --> 02:10:08,217
We will get it in some time.

1613
02:10:12,520 --> 02:10:13,730
See, it comes.

1614
02:10:13,810 --> 02:10:16,163
Hey, taxi!

1615
02:10:16,952 --> 02:10:18,562
Come, come.

1616
02:10:26,810 --> 02:10:29,318
O My God! I forgot my purse
in the temple itself.

1617
02:10:29,398 --> 02:10:31,415
- I will get it.
- No you sit here, I will get it.

1618
02:10:34,443 --> 02:10:38,583
Grandma, grandma.

1619
02:10:40,821 --> 02:10:43,361
Someone help me.

1620
02:10:43,441 --> 02:10:46,694
They have taken her. Help!

1621
02:10:46,774 --> 02:10:50,832
They have taken my
child, someone help me.

1622
02:10:51,130 --> 02:10:52,795
- What happened, grandma?
- What are you asking me?

1623
02:10:52,875 --> 02:10:54,612
Follow that cab and save her.

1624
02:10:54,692 --> 02:10:55,963
Come on, hurry up.

1625
02:11:08,082 --> 02:11:09,552
- Where is she?
- Where is she?

1626
02:11:09,632 --> 02:11:10,482
Who and what?

1627
02:11:10,562 --> 02:11:12,406
- Where is Neha?
- We are ready.

1628
02:11:13,282 --> 02:11:14,612
Neha!

1629
02:11:15,606 --> 02:11:18,741
Then that cab.

1630
02:11:19,015 --> 02:11:22,293
Neha has gone in
that cab. Oh no.

1631
02:11:22,373 --> 02:11:24,474
C'mon, hurry up. Go and save her.

1632
02:11:24,854 --> 02:11:27,873
- Driver, take the cab there.
- Go and save her.

1633
02:11:27,953 --> 02:11:29,887
- Come fast. Come on.
- Follow Neha's cab.

1634
02:11:30,058 --> 02:11:31,856
Come fast. Come on.

1635
02:11:31,936 --> 02:11:34,953
O My God! What have I done?

1636
02:11:35,334 --> 02:11:36,630
Drive faster. Grandma!

1637
02:11:36,710 --> 02:11:37,936
Shut up.

1638
02:11:38,447 --> 02:11:40,904
- Where are you taking me to?
- You'll know very soon.

1639
02:11:40,984 --> 02:11:42,883
Leave me.
Where are you taking me to?

1640
02:11:43,211 --> 02:11:45,191
- Shut up.
- Keep driving.

1641
02:11:47,993 --> 02:11:49,325
Shut up.

1642
02:11:50,667 --> 02:11:52,527
- Someone is following us.
- Siddharth.

1643
02:11:53,037 --> 02:11:55,433
- Drive faster.
- Stop the cab. - Faster.

1644
02:11:56,531 --> 02:11:59,005
- Come on follow.
- Whom to follow?

1645
02:11:59,341 --> 02:12:00,215
Nobody is to be seen.

1646
02:12:00,295 --> 02:12:02,489
- You just follow him.
- Come on, drive fast.

1647
02:12:02,569 --> 02:12:04,253
- Follow them.
- Faster.

1648
02:12:06,053 --> 02:12:08,112
- Help! Help!
- Shut up.

1649
02:12:08,899 --> 02:12:10,879
- Siddharth.
- Come on, get hold of him.

1650
02:12:10,959 --> 02:12:12,514
Siddharth, help me.

1651
02:12:12,730 --> 02:12:14,555
Go straight. Drive faster.

1652
02:12:16,742 --> 02:12:18,964
- Get them.
- Help!

1653
02:12:19,044 --> 02:12:21,269
- Help!
- Not 'help'. Come on, get hold of him.

1654
02:12:21,349 --> 02:12:22,471
Right.

1655
02:12:23,542 --> 02:12:25,108
- Leave me.
- Shut up.

1656
02:12:26,136 --> 02:12:27,434
Leave me. What are you doing?

1657
02:12:29,284 --> 02:12:32,744
- We have come far ahead.
- That's obvious.

1658
02:12:33,178 --> 02:12:35,660
- We have reached our hideout.
- Help! Where are you taking me to?

1659
02:12:35,740 --> 02:12:37,369
- This girl is creating...
- Stop.

1660
02:12:37,449 --> 02:12:39,006
...a lot of commotion.

1661
02:12:40,763 --> 02:12:42,043
Siddharth.

1662
02:12:44,136 --> 02:12:45,373
Come on.

1663
02:12:45,614 --> 02:12:47,171
- Come on.
- Leave me.

1664
02:12:47,768 --> 02:12:49,498
Where are you taking me?
I won't come.

1665
02:12:50,301 --> 02:12:51,348
Boss.

1666
02:12:54,315 --> 02:12:55,534
Siddharth.

1667
02:12:57,687 --> 02:12:59,979
- No.
- Come on.

1668
02:13:06,155 --> 02:13:08,273
Come to fight with us in our area.

1669
02:13:21,540 --> 02:13:23,416
- Hey.
- Leave me.

1670
02:13:24,289 --> 02:13:25,656
Come on.

1671
02:13:44,519 --> 02:13:45,730
Siddharth, watch out!

1672
02:13:52,137 --> 02:13:55,536
- Siddharth, we are here.
- Don't worry.

1673
02:14:05,223 --> 02:14:07,030
Kids must not play with pistols.

1674
02:14:12,487 --> 02:14:14,104
Listen. Listen. Listen.

1675
02:14:20,150 --> 02:14:21,586
He pulls the beard.

1676
02:14:27,225 --> 02:14:28,738
Siddharth, help!

1677
02:14:34,369 --> 02:14:35,321
Scoundrel.

1678
02:14:35,401 --> 02:14:36,497
Freeze!

1679
02:14:36,577 --> 02:14:38,278
Don't move! Come on.

1680
02:14:41,747 --> 02:14:43,451
Come on.

1681
02:14:46,339 --> 02:14:47,800
You son of pigeons.

1682
02:14:48,942 --> 02:14:52,480
If we cannot live together,
then let's die together.

1683
02:14:54,020 --> 02:14:56,372
Mr. Villain, please leave us.

1684
02:14:56,452 --> 02:14:58,526
If it's a matter of just one or two
lakhs, then we will pay it to you.

1685
02:14:58,606 --> 02:14:59,633
Yes later on.

1686
02:14:59,713 --> 02:15:01,760
- We deal in credits.
- Yes.

1687
02:15:01,840 --> 02:15:02,911
- Shut up.
- Okay.

1688
02:15:02,991 --> 02:15:07,374
Okay. Remember your God.. One. Two.

1689
02:15:10,010 --> 02:15:12,778
Hey, Lallan Miya is here.

1690
02:15:12,858 --> 02:15:16,773
Bravo! Help has arrived.

1691
02:15:18,935 --> 02:15:20,189
You fool.

1692
02:15:23,370 --> 02:15:25,359
How come you arrived here?

1693
02:15:25,688 --> 02:15:28,619
It so happened that Bansi
brought both of them over here.

1694
02:15:28,699 --> 02:15:32,494
When he came here, he saw that
there was firing going on.

1695
02:15:32,676 --> 02:15:37,320
He came to me and I brought
the police along with me.

1696
02:15:38,791 --> 02:15:41,325
The culprits are booked now.

1697
02:15:44,594 --> 02:15:47,388
How can we repay for
this timely help of yours?

1698
02:15:47,468 --> 02:15:50,398
Forget this, but
repay all your dues.

1699
02:15:51,523 --> 02:15:54,057
Congratulations! The
department is proud of you.

1700
02:15:54,137 --> 02:15:55,148
- Thank you sir.
- That's our duty.

1701
02:15:55,228 --> 02:15:56,565
Please sign here.

1702
02:15:56,645 --> 02:15:58,113
- Pen.
- Sure.

1703
02:15:59,143 --> 02:16:00,128
Here.

1704
02:16:02,861 --> 02:16:04,790
This is your reward.

1705
02:16:04,989 --> 02:16:06,425
You will have to share it.

1706
02:16:07,065 --> 02:16:10,637
Sir! I have already
received my reward.

1707
02:16:12,073 --> 02:16:16,313
- When will we get such a reward?
- Have patience.

1708
02:16:16,641 --> 02:16:18,925
Salutations. Thanks a lot!

1709
02:16:28,636 --> 02:16:30,115
I have received my dues.

1710
02:16:36,343 --> 02:16:39,811
- Good day to you Lallan Miya!
- Salutations, Lallan Miya!

1711
02:16:41,256 --> 02:16:44,015
You both are all dressed up.

1712
02:16:44,171 --> 02:16:46,255
Wow! It's great.

1713
02:16:46,335 --> 02:16:48,071
Your shop looks all decked up.

1714
02:16:48,151 --> 02:16:49,057
Here, have a look at this.

1715
02:16:49,137 --> 02:16:51,488
Wow! It's great.

1716
02:16:51,568 --> 02:16:53,936
- Take my Dunhill.
- Here you go.

1717
02:16:54,117 --> 02:16:55,449
Not this.
I need the entire carton.

1718
02:16:55,529 --> 02:16:56,764
- Carton?
- Yes.

1719
02:16:57,309 --> 02:16:59,151

1721
02:17:00,751 --> 02:17:02,904
- Dunhill.
- Very nice.

1722
02:17:02,984 --> 02:17:04,599
We buy that, which belongs to our country.

1723
02:17:04,679 --> 02:17:07,056
Old is gold. One carton Gold.

1724
02:17:08,553 --> 02:17:11,295
- Coming. Coming. Gold.
- Thank you, Lallan Miya.

1725
02:17:11,375 --> 02:17:14,667
- My money.
- Write it in our account.

1726
02:17:14,747 --> 02:17:15,999
We have started a new account from now on.

1727
02:17:16,079 --> 02:17:17,729
Omi, prey!

1728
02:17:18,568 --> 02:17:21,093
- Follow me.
- Hey! Listen to me. Hey, you!

1729
02:17:21,344 --> 02:17:28,339
<i>"Love has many names..."</i>

1730
02:17:28,419 --> 02:17:35,465
<i>"...but the story is the same,
yet each episode is new."</i>

1731
02:17:35,545 --> 02:17:38,978
<i>"There is nothing to say."</i>

1732
02:17:39,058 --> 02:17:40,827
<i>"Is it something to stay mum?"</i>

1733
02:17:40,907 --> 02:17:47,650
<i>"Love has many names..."</i>

1734
02:17:47,730 --> 02:17:55,001
<i>"...but the story is the same,
yet each episode is new."</i>

1735
02:18:18,149 --> 02:18:21,652
<i>"My pal steals the gaze..."</i>

1736
02:18:21,732 --> 02:18:25,251
<i>"...and hides his
secrets in the heart."</i>

1737
02:18:25,331 --> 02:18:29,121
<i>"Doesn't speak out the sorrows
nor shares the joy."</i>

1738
02:18:29,201 --> 02:18:32,440
<i>"Just don't know for whom he
has become so formal."</i>

1739
02:18:32,520 --> 02:18:37,791
<i>"Even we will stop treating him
as a friend. Got it, dear?"</i>

1740
02:18:39,684 --> 02:18:46,712
<i>"Love has many names..."</i>

1741
02:18:46,792 --> 02:18:52,102

1742
02:18:52,182 --> 02:18:59,119

1743
02:18:59,199 --> 02:19:06,513
<i>"...but the story is the same,
yet each episode is new."</i>

1744
02:19:31,668 --> 02:19:38,836
<i>"One who learns the
language of love."</i>

1745
02:19:38,916 --> 02:19:46,209
<i>"Is called insane."</i>

1746
02:19:46,289 --> 02:19:49,820
<i>"One of the three friends
has got a girl."</i>

1747
02:19:49,900 --> 02:19:53,139
<i>"The two have developed
hopes as well."</i>

1748
02:19:53,538 --> 02:19:57,105
<i>"Fate will smile at us,
have you understood, dear?"</i>

1749
02:19:57,185 --> 02:19:58,998
<i>"Have you understood, dear?"</i>
