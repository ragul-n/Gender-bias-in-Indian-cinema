1
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:15,704
There are about a million literate
unemployed in Bengal.

2
00:00:15,706 --> 00:00:19,710
I don't know how many
illiterate ones there are.

3
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:24,053
From this arises most of the problems.

4
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:28,054
I am not one of them.

5
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:32,459
I've worked in a foreign commercial firm
for the past 10 years.

6
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:36,734
The name of the concern is
Hindustan Peters.

7
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:40,067
The liability of members is limited.

8
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:45,675
We deal with air and light:
Peters Lamp and Peters Fan.

9
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:53,746
We have a factory in the Suburbs,
with 1200 workers.

10
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,725
We've started exporting fans.

11
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:45,803
These ceiling fans will be exported to Iraq.

12
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:50,508
The order for 10,000 is valued at 12 lakhs.

13
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:05,785
I have much responsibility

14
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:11,027
as I am the Sales Manager
of the Fan Division.

15
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:14,361
My name is Shyamalendu Chatterjee.

16
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:18,036
I spent my childood in Patna.

17
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:21,070
My father was a school teacher.

18
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:26,768
I did my schooling in Patna.
I was a good student.

19
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:31,776
I got a first class first in English M.A.

20
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:37,746
After my education I too
was a teacher like my father.

21
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:46,890
Then I applied for a job
from a newspaper ad.

22
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:54,330
I was called in due course

23
00:02:54,331 --> 00:02:57,566
and interviewed at Peters Ltd.
Patna branch.

24
00:02:57,643 --> 00:03:02,437
Manager Davidson interviewed me
for half an hour.

25
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,544
I had no problem giving my views.

26
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:13,649
After some time the postman handed me
an envelope bearing the Peter's logo.

27
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,292
I got the appointment letter

28
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:20,187
with a starting salary of Rs. 800.

29
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:26,438
There was a gap of one and half months,

30
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:29,237
so I completed a necessary duty.

31
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,925
The girl's name is Dolonchampa.

32
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:37,508
She read Shakespeare under
Professor Bhattacharjee, her father.

33
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:45,490
After marriage,
my first posting was in Delhi.

34
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:51,093
I left for Delhi on February 25, 1960
with my family.

35
00:03:55,831 --> 00:04:01,767
From then till today, March 5, 1970,
I rose very fast.

36
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:10,045
Behind this is my intelligence, luck
and a great deal of toil.

37
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:17,216
Today my attention, interest

38
00:04:17,217 --> 00:04:22,921
and entire focus are
interlinked with Peters.

39
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:28,634
For last 7 years we have been in Calcutta

40
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:31,466
initially staying in a flat at Balligunge.

41
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:36,363
After I was made Sales Manager
we got the Company's flat.

42
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:43,706
My parents are in Calcutta.
I've arranged a flat for them.

43
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,819
We have a 7 year old son
named Raja.

44
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:04,169
Raja attends St. Paul's School
in Darjeeling.

45
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,306
He boards there.

46
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:09,973
We see him during vacation.

47
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,249
Our head office has 180 on staff.

48
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:23,419
The M.D., Managing Director,
is Mr. Andrew Pheris.

49
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:28,320
He was a student at Balliol College, Oxford.

50
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:34,256
Under him are Marketing Director Davidson
and Finance Director Gordon.

51
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:42,169
Davidson is in England now
suffering from cancer.

52
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:49,530
Just under them are
two hopeful Sales Managers

53
00:05:49,531 --> 00:05:54,574
Ranadeb Sanyal
of the Lamp Division

54
00:05:54,575 --> 00:05:59,666
and Shyamalendu Chatterjee

55
00:05:59,667 --> 00:06:04,763
of the Fan Division,
meaning me.

Thank you.

69
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:46,756
Hello, Mr. Talukdar, how are you?

70
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:51,624
Standing beside you...

71
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,027
You are thinking physically.

72
00:08:58,437 --> 00:08:59,797
Your father must be tall.

73
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:00,936
No.

74
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:02,032
Then...

75
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:03,702
Mother.

76
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:11,547
Morning.

77
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,649
Good morning Mr. Chatterjee.

78
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:13,743
You're already here?

79
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:15,420
This is the last page.

80
00:09:15,425 --> 00:09:16,484
Take your time.

81
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:36,901
Why is the fan on?

82
00:09:36,902 --> 00:09:39,409
I scrubbed before.

83
00:09:40,882 --> 00:09:45,113
Scrubbed here quite vigorously.

84
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:54,552
If you keep the fan on
money will deducted from your salary.

85
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:18,207
My residential line is out of order.
Please complain.

86
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:19,249
Certainly.

87
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:26,883
Why are you surprised?
You asked me to come early.

88
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:30,291
Not at you, but at your sense of duty.

89
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:38,126
Good morning Mr. Chatterjee.

90
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,194
Good morning.

91
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,234
What can I do for you?

92
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,451
Change your hair style, for one thing.

93
00:10:45,452 --> 00:10:46,973
I like the last one better.

94
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:48,943
I'll think about it.

95
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,664
Is M.D. in?

96
00:10:51,565 --> 00:10:52,582
You want to see Mr. Pheris?

97
00:10:54,883 --> 00:10:55,889
This is very urgent.

98
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:57,616
Alright.

99
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:01,724
Good morning.

100
00:11:01,725 --> 00:11:02,491
I was coming to see you.

101
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:04,017
Come in.

102
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:06,722
The projection is at 10 o'clock.

103
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,597
Yes, for about 10 minutes,
nearby at the Roxy.

104
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,473
My only regret
is I couldn't get an Iraqi.

105
00:11:24,049 --> 00:11:25,379
Don't you like her?

106
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:27,235
I think she's rather attractive.

107
00:11:27,236 --> 00:11:30,242
It's a question of authenticity.

108
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:32,749
Come on, the ad will be showing.

109
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:47,830
That's one minute, is it?

110
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,995
Roughly. One hundred feet.

111
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:52,697
I think it's long.

112
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:56,270
It ended abruptly.

113
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,905
That's a desired effect, you see.

114
00:12:58,906 --> 00:13:00,972
The impact, it has to be snappy!

115
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,277
I rather liked the theme.

116
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:26,228
Good morning.

117
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:28,535
Just come in?

118
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,032
Sit down.

119
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:36,206
Any news?

120
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,548
What, about us?

121
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:42,180
It's your time.

122
00:13:42,181 --> 00:13:43,144
What?

123
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:44,747
It's true.

124
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,791
That's your view.

125
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:48,919
No poster, no slogan proclaims it.

126
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:52,797
I was talking in a larger context.

127
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:54,629
You are king at Peters.

128
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:57,462
It's much better if you
talked in the plural.

129
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:01,938
Today there is a board meeting.

130
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:08,339
You sent me a note.

131
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:10,448
Not offence meant.

132
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,016
Be there.

133
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,541
You may be called in.

134
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:16,583
Will you be asking the questions?

135
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:18,316
Don't make me laugh.

136
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:22,220
No sir.
I know our own people.

137
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:24,886
They are afraid of outsiders.

138
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:26,958
They've never faced them.

139
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,795
Till now Davidson used to face...

140
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,763
Now we will be called in.

141
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:33,600
What will the other directors do?

142
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:36,671
They may ask odd questions.

143
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:39,698
I'll tell what they'll do.

144
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:43,046
Sir Barun will doze most of the time.

145
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:49,143
Kumar Jagadish will lift his hand
if necessary. He never speaks.

146
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:53,648
Murty is from Delhi,
you know him.

147
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,791
Only Mr. Forrester...

148
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:58,556
you have kept many such in your pocket.

149
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:02,423
Are you afraid of Panchu Boral?

150
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:06,129
No. I have mixed feelings.

151
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:08,606
It's nothing.

152
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:12,965
You are quite happy acting with me.

153
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:20,208
The way I see it you won't be
in this room for long.

154
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,146
Sir, Peters Company.

155
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,179
Oh! Alright.

156
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,549
Morning.

157
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,621
Morning Mr. Chatterjee.

158
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,229
Have they all come?

159
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:08,366
Only Mr. Boral.

160
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:09,129
They'll just be coming.

161
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:12,833
Morning, Mr. Chatterjee.

162
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:13,870
How are you?

163
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:20,471
Nice to see you, my boy!

164
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:21,937
How are you?

165
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:25,541
Me. Alright,
right as rain!

166
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:29,453
Going to the club, attending meetings,

167
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:32,089
passing 70.

168
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:35,622
You are like your Rolls Royce,

169
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,888
getting costly with age.

170
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:41,833
I had to fight for it.

171
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,897
I am a fighter.

172
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:50,007
The struggle nowadays and that
of the British era are not same.

173
00:16:50,977 --> 00:16:56,871
Now the ministers are unable to
manage even one or two M.P. s.

174
00:17:01,155 --> 00:17:06,810
In our time we kept them
under our thumb

175
00:17:06,811 --> 00:17:11,119
and when necessary
threw them out.

176
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:17,191
I've worked with hard nosed Brits.

177
00:17:19,327 --> 00:17:20,330
Morning.

178
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:25,207
When did you arrive?

179
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:28,735
Last night... 1:30.

180
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:32,010
We had engine trouble at Palam.

181
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:46,196
Are you coming?

182
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,035
I remembered while
he was speaking of trouble.

183
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:53,504
Did I tell him the story of Auckinlek?

184
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:57,905
Probably Mr. Chatterjee hasn't heard it.

185
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:00,172
Chatterjee? Didn't I tell you that story?

186
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:04,239
No. I don't think so.

187
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:08,876
The war was then in full swing.

188
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:15,518
For my note against a T.A. Bill

189
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:19,988
of Field Marshal Auckinlek...

190
00:18:19,989 --> 00:18:23,962
it almost got cancelled.

191
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:25,464
Morning.

192
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:31,850
I hope you don't mind my going back
for a while because

193
00:18:31,851 --> 00:18:35,366
I just started telling them a story
which I haven't finished yet.

194
00:18:35,413 --> 00:18:36,471
No. Not at all.

195
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:42,415
That's a long story...

196
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:44,686
I went up to the Viceroy...

197
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:53,489
only on the personal request of
the Finance Secretary, I calmed down...

198
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:59,560
Come to my house sometime
and I'll tell you the entire episode.

199
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:08,035
But think of their greatness and
they got knighthood even after that.

200
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,447
That is there, but you couldn't stop short.

201
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:16,479
Well, I am coming.

202
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,354
Arrange for the coffee.

203
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:20,922
Don't go away.

204
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,410
Morning Chatterjee.

205
00:19:49,411 --> 00:19:50,487
Good morning.

206
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,555
We are both in the same boat.

207
00:19:57,129 --> 00:20:00,625
I was sent a note yesterday, and told
they may call on me today.

208
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:02,895
Would you like one?

209
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:04,693
No, I prefer cigarettes.

210
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:07,998
Have you seen the paper?

211
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,165
Cancer!

212
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:13,733
Cigarette ads may be stopped.

213
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:19,339
But that is pointless since they
aren't stopping manufacturing.

214
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:26,453
What's that ring?

215
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,389
That's from Ramalingam.

216
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:33,322
Ramalingam is selling rings nowadays?

217
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,096
I'm not having a good time.

218
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:38,768
It's coral.

219
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,902
I asked my wife. It arrived the next day.

220
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:12,935
Listen, you are not needed.

221
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:14,865
You may go.

222
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:27,313
See if my residence line is ok.

223
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:31,819
Connect me with my residence.

224
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:33,415
It's still not alright?

225
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,249
Ok. Leave it.

226
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,597
No... not me alone...
Chatterjee too was called.

227
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,656
Really? Then?

228
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:43,957
Nothing. We came back.

229
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:45,899
You weren't called in?

230
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:48,232
Not needed.

231
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,738
When did the phone start working?

232
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,538
Just now.

233
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:33,619
Dearest Papa and Mama,

234
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:39,395
How are you? I am alright.

235
00:23:39,396 --> 00:23:45,024
Exams begin on Monday,
so I'm studying hard.

236
00:23:45,025 --> 00:23:50,658
Today it is very misty.

237
00:23:50,659 --> 00:23:56,259
I like mist but not rain.

238
00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:01,770
The rain is nice in Calcutta.

239
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:05,308
I miss you. When are you coming?

240
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,369
Do write.

241
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:09,977
Love and kisses from Raja

242
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:24,819
Have you read the letter?

243
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,191
Raja's?

244
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:28,459
Not only Raja's, your sister-in-law's.

245
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:29,763
Tutul!

246
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:31,632
That's why I was arranging the guest room.

247
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:33,469
When is she coming?

248
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:36,403
Tomorrow morning.
Her train arrives around 8-8:30.

249
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,072
Tomorrow morning?

250
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:40,434
It's not her fault

251
00:24:40,435 --> 00:24:42,441
the letter came so late.

252
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:49,111
Tomorrow is Saturday.
You don't have to go to the office?

253
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:51,176
I just have to drop in.

254
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:53,757
It's exciting.

255
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:55,526
She came last in 1963.

256
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:57,685
She hasn't seen this flat.

257
00:24:58,463 --> 00:24:59,954
Jolly good.

258
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:02,627
I felt sad reading Raja's letter.

259
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:03,793
Why?

260
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:06,163
I felt like rushing there to get him.

261
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:08,872
No. He's quite well there.

262
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:12,271
Here neither of you would be satisfied

263
00:25:12,272 --> 00:25:14,667
nor would he have gotten an education.

264
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:24,687
Use the other bathroom,
we both have to go out.

265
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:35,990
What's his name?

266
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:38,669
The relative of Tuku Aunty

267
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:39,830
who works in Geskin?

268
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:43,171
Who, Prakash?

269
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:45,900
Shall we invite him tomorrow?

270
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:47,835
Why him?

271
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:50,042
We could introduce him to Tutul.

272
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:53,449
You are mad.

273
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:56,142
Why, he's quite a nice boy.

274
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:59,256
Your sister may already be involved.

275
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,150
Err... rubbish.

276
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:03,287
How do you know?

277
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:04,920
Mother informed me.

278
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:13,196
Mothers may not know everything.

279
00:26:16,981 --> 00:26:20,982
Your sister, by now she

280
00:26:20,983 --> 00:26:26,408
ought to be a most
attractive young lady.

281
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:29,446
That's what I was telling...

282
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:32,210
Ha! Don't hurry.

283
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:35,454
She'll be staying for some time.

284
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:38,324
About a fortnight I believe.

285
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:44,893
Who could have come?

286
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,268
Whatever... don't delay.

287
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:51,601
What's up Sushanto?

288
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:54,745
Wait a moment.

289
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:57,874
Who is it?

290
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,917
Sushanto.

291
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,887
We are going out.

292
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:06,321
Oh! Then...

293
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:10,422
No, please sit for a while.

294
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:18,260
Anything new?

295
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,265
Mother sent this.

296
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,370
What's that?

297
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:24,902
Err... nothing.

298
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,638
No need for formality.

299
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:31,244
Err... got the job from you...

300
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,017
How is the new job?

301
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:35,418
Ok.

302
00:27:35,419 --> 00:27:36,280
Getting along with everybody?

303
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:37,613
Yes.

304
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,079
How is the factory working out?
Any trouble?

305
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:41,924
Not much.

306
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:48,195
But how about the fish?

307
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:51,026
Rotten fish... big trouble.

308
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:54,737
No, it was settled by the afternoon.

309
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:00,469
Ok.

310
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:02,272
Tell me if there is any problem.

311
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:04,145
Ok... I'll go.

312
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:08,143
Halim, we're going out. We'll be late.

313
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,052
How do you feel?

314
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:48,250
It's like a dream.

315
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:50,450
Nightmare!

316
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:55,333
Not bad. But I find

317
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:57,858
a lot of changes in 7 years.

318
00:28:58,603 --> 00:28:59,892
More than you?

319
00:29:01,138 --> 00:29:02,902
He didn't recognise you.

320
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:06,006
Did he know me before?

321
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:22,416
Tutul, tell us about Patna.

322
00:29:22,627 --> 00:29:26,551
I was there in '64.
But he hasn't been.

323
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:31,057
Your office is still there
where you were interviewed.

324
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:32,933
Most likely...

325
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:34,063
otherwise I would have known.

326
00:29:34,672 --> 00:29:36,640
Oh! You know Whisky is dead.

327
00:29:37,008 --> 00:29:38,099
Whisky?

328
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:42,877
You haven't seen our dog.
He was so sweet.

329
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,037
What a pity.

330
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:46,375
What happened?

331
00:29:46,376 --> 00:29:47,548
Hepatitis.

332
00:29:47,685 --> 00:29:50,282
Three years old. He got sick
and died in three days.

333
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:52,922
Talking about a dog...

334
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:56,023
Mrs. Felip promised to give you one.

335
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:00,893
I'll have to wait.

336
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,835
I'm wondering how you are allowed
to come here.

337
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:09,596
What?

338
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:11,538
Nobody comes to Calcutta nowadays.

339
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:13,343
I do.

340
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:14,406
That's what I find.

341
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:17,277
But how your parents could allow...

342
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:21,709
They weren't worried.
You are here.

343
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:24,778
Looking at the streets, could one guess
about all these killings?

344
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:28,850
Did you know them?

345
00:30:28,851 --> 00:30:30,588
Those who were killed?

346
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:32,159
No, those who are killing.

347
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:34,529
Nonsense. How he would he know them?

348
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:40,467
Do you know? Please tell.

349
00:30:40,738 --> 00:30:44,037
Have you come to Calcutta
to know these revolutionaries?

350
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:45,670
There's one non-revolutionary.

351
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:47,702
I'll study him.

352
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:50,380
That is beyond you.

353
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:53,046
It requires deep insight
to study such a one.

354
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:57,184
I have studied Psychology
and much more.

355
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,181
Fortunately you don't look like it.

356
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:06,155
Put those things in the guest room.

357
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:08,760
I am coming now.

358
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:16,936
Peters lamp.

359
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:21,141
Peters fan.

360
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:27,448
Made by you?

361
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:30,078
Made by my factory. I sell them.

362
00:31:31,755 --> 00:31:34,613
I've waited a long time
to show you the flat.

363
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:36,949
Come here.

364
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:43,061
Oh! How nice!

365
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:47,000
There's lots of noise at night.

366
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:50,032
I can't distinguish between
a gun and a bomb.

367
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:52,843
But it's so peaceful now.

368
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:54,478
Because it is on the 8th floor.

369
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:56,709
I was afraid I might be put
somewhere down below

370
00:31:56,710 --> 00:32:02,011
with the dust... flies... pollution...
everything else...

371
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,178
Come, let me show your room.

372
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:08,816
You won't be afraid at night.

373
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,023
I sleep there alone.

374
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,294
The air conditioner is there,

375
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:15,728
you may put on the fan.

376
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:17,196
The fan is better.

377
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:19,427
We can't sleep with the windows closed.

378
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:25,208
There's towel, soap, everything.

379
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:25,971
You don't require...

380
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,302
What's that?

381
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:30,409
Let me show you.

382
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:36,178
Turn it on and you'll get hot water
in 5-7 minutes.

383
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:38,580
It won't burst?

384
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:39,646
Are you mad?

385
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:41,881
Come.

386
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:47,494
You don't use this room?

387
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:51,928
Normally, a friend of his stays here.

388
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:53,727
And your in-laws?

389
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:56,533
A flat has been arranged for them.

390
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:59,209
Can't they live here?

391
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:05,094
There are certain Company rules.
They don't allow parents.

392
00:33:06,295 --> 00:33:12,178
He thought of protesting
but father in-law objected.

393
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:17,622
But that's not correct.
Why should you follow such odd rules?

394
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:20,797
Punish me for that.

395
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:25,694
The flat is beautiful.
I couldn't dream that you have risen so far.

396
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:27,569
The next post is Directorship.

397
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:28,668
When?

398
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:30,132
I'm not certain.

399
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,200
We'll get a bigger flat with that.

400
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:33,233
Then they may not even allow me.

401
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:36,573
There's no rule for sister-in-laws.

402
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:39,780
Bye.

403
00:33:39,781 --> 00:33:40,807
Where are you going?

404
00:33:40,808 --> 00:33:42,391
Where else? The office.

405
00:33:42,392 --> 00:33:43,785
Even if Saturday is a holiday
he has to go to the office.

406
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:46,655
I'll pick you up at 12:45.
Then we'll have lunch at the club.

407
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:49,083
But I have to get my hair done.

408
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:52,999
Alright. I'll drop you off
after lunch. Then we'll

409
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,923
send the car from the race track

410
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:56,799
and return after your hair is done.

411
00:33:57,902 --> 00:33:59,426
Race? Race track?

412
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,698
Don't you know every Saturday
there is horse racing?

413
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:03,373
You go to the races?

414
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:09,104
Unless you see it
your study will be incomplete.

415
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,345
Do you bet?

416
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:13,383
You too will bet.

417
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:15,586
but you have to change your dress.

418
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:19,086
It's perfectly all right.

419
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:21,253
It's not worthy of you.

420
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,421
You don't need a better one.

421
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:28,461
You don't have to worry.
I'll take charge of her dress.

422
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:30,463
Alright. Bye bye.

423
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:40,667
Come... sit... let's gossip.

424
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:46,540
The others are old.

425
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:50,079
Got it.

426
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:04,765
Sit.

427
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,071
You are really enjoying yourself, sister.

428
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,138
You too will enjoy it.

429
00:35:18,082 --> 00:35:19,606
Shymal must be earning a lot.

430
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:22,242
He'll get 1.2 lakhs
when he becomes Director.

431
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:23,285
What?

432
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:25,482
Per annum, not in a month.

433
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:30,617
But he has a rival in the Lamps Department.

434
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:33,621
1.2 lakhs.

435
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:37,798
He has very good reputation in the office.

436
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:40,637
He bagged an order from the Far East.

437
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,101
Almost same as Rabindranath
got for the Nobel Prize.

438
00:35:45,209 --> 00:35:48,411
But he has worked hard for that.

439
00:35:48,412 --> 00:35:49,746
He travels a lot.

440
00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:51,843
He just returned from the Middle East.

441
00:35:52,219 --> 00:35:54,574
He has 20 days travel a month.

442
00:35:54,575 --> 00:35:56,850
Don't enquire about his work.

443
00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:58,149
What do you do?

444
00:35:58,656 --> 00:35:59,782
Oh! Various things.

445
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:05,752
Cooking... knitting...

446
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:11,802
occasionally gossiping with
other officers' wives.

447
00:36:17,441 --> 00:36:19,870
I thought of studying.

448
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:21,976
Then why didn't you go for it?

449
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:26,544
I couldn't gather enough energy.

450
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:32,255
Frankly my biggest worry
is his Directorship.

451
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:39,489
It's really nice to get everything you want.

452
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:42,928
There's a lad here in a coveted post.

453
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:45,363
Would you like to meet him?

454
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:48,461
Or would you like to be a professor?

455
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:54,065
I've not decided.

456
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,865
I didn't know there's a place
like this in Calcutta.

457
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:28,701
This club is slightly better than others.

458
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:31,513
10 years ago, you wouldn't have
been admitted here.

459
00:37:31,514 --> 00:37:32,805
It was meant only for foreigners.

460
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,009
Exclusive.

461
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:37,183
Now they are all same?

462
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:42,280
There's a difference of colour,
but no other preference.

463
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,526
Is it right or wrong?

464
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:45,653
What strange questions.

465
00:37:45,896 --> 00:37:46,885
I wanted to know.

466
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:48,223
Does Shyamal have all the answers?

467
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:51,902
Must be. He is in such a high post.

468
00:37:53,237 --> 00:37:58,072
The artificial barrier is gone.

469
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:04,811
Men according to ability...

470
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:07,112
What ability?

471
00:38:07,113 --> 00:38:08,615
Oh! Tutul!

472
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:21,088
Good morning. How are you?

473
00:38:21,365 --> 00:38:22,459
Good morning.

474
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:24,962
How are you dear?

475
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:29,371
Let me introduce
my sister-in-law Sudarshana.

476
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,976
How appropriate.

477
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:38,815
She's come only today.

478
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,151
Will you be staying for some time?

479
00:38:45,689 --> 00:38:50,883
Why, even if I am 70, I've no cataracts yet.

480
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:57,390
Otherwise, why should I come
towards your table?

481
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:05,506
Who is he?

482
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:07,476
A big fish.

483
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,543
Sir Barun Roy.

484
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:10,775
One of the Directors.

485
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:12,609
He has a fearful presence.

486
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:14,980
He's quite harmless really.

487
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:21,849
He's staring at me.

488
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:24,053
He must have liked you.

489
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:29,557
Unfortunately, you are not the only
woman whom he stares at like that.

490
00:39:31,368 --> 00:39:32,829
He's still staring at me.

491
00:39:34,537 --> 00:39:35,664
Don't look.

492
00:39:36,469 --> 00:39:38,104
I can feel it even when I don't look.

493
00:39:38,842 --> 00:39:41,075
Think about the young ones.

494
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:45,580
You'll behave like this
when you become a Director?

495
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,375
Not with everybody.

496
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:53,214
Oh. Why a hermit doesn't know
what he's doing with his steno...

497
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:54,486
Is she beautiful?

498
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:57,125
Why don't you come to our office
and I'll introduce you.

499
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:02,158
He will not allow me to eat.

500
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:17,073
I'm going... send back the car.

501
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:22,512
Let me have a look... only for two minutes.

502
00:42:25,976 --> 00:42:29,434
Oh! Chrysanthemum... beautiful name.

503
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:31,642
Nobody bets on a name.

504
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:33,213
I do.

505
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:34,342
How much to win?

506
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,644
In the tenth you will get 7Rs.

507
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:40,584
Is that good or bad?

508
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:41,782
What do you think?

509
00:42:41,783 --> 00:42:42,857
Quite good.

510
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,726
Then it is alright.

511
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:50,465
How do I recognise my horse?

512
00:42:51,368 --> 00:42:56,738
By number... yours is number 6.

513
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:59,606
My birthday number.

514
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:05,743
Who is he?

515
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:07,748
Mr. Pheris. Our M.D.

516
00:43:07,818 --> 00:43:10,016
A doctor?

517
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,553
Managing Director.

518
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:24,961
If a bomb explodes here...

519
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:30,205
Here we go.

520
00:43:30,208 --> 00:43:31,297
Where?

521
00:43:31,642 --> 00:43:32,731
There.

522
00:44:11,115 --> 00:44:12,174
What happened?

523
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:13,310
It's finished.

524
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:14,507
Number 6?

525
00:44:14,509 --> 00:44:16,718
No. 6 is second and No. 3 is first.

526
00:44:18,922 --> 00:44:19,980
I'll play once again.

527
00:44:30,968 --> 00:44:32,464
One moment.

528
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:51,621
Look at your sister-in-law.

529
00:45:07,571 --> 00:45:08,799
Are you dumb?

530
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:13,736
Did I marry the right one?

531
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:16,741
Apply for a divorce.

532
00:45:17,617 --> 00:45:20,479
Divorce? It requires some grounds.

533
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:24,943
Then I shall beat you regularly.

534
00:45:27,825 --> 00:45:31,591
Mental cruelty will at least save my skin.

535
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,826
Wonderful conversation!

536
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:44,365
You must have a sherry today.

537
00:45:45,342 --> 00:45:46,870
Not at all.

538
00:45:47,611 --> 00:45:48,675
Why?

539
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:52,346
Your sister takes it.

540
00:45:52,683 --> 00:45:54,742
Not regularly.

541
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:58,386
But I am not the wife of a sales manager.

542
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,284
I only sit and watch.

543
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:03,420
Studying...

544
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:08,690
I heard you drink a lot.

545
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:16,262
You complained to your sister?

546
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:18,938
I will see you get drunk?

547
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:22,368
I only drink at parties.

548
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:28,423
No, it's not that the lady
hadn't seen the man before...

549
00:46:28,424 --> 00:46:32,845
he just took one look at the lady...

550
00:46:37,027 --> 00:46:38,874
even then he predicted correctly...

551
00:46:38,875 --> 00:46:42,996
then he described the
symptoms of epilepsy.

552
00:46:52,176 --> 00:46:53,271
Meaning?

553
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:54,375
What was it?

554
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:56,208
A locket.

555
00:46:56,779 --> 00:46:57,909
Came into his hand?

556
00:46:58,447 --> 00:47:00,878
Do you know the locket
was not an ordinary one?

557
00:47:02,186 --> 00:47:05,155
There was a picture of him on one side
and his masters' on the other.

558
00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:07,178
Then...

559
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:08,757
the man said to wear this.

560
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:14,754
And I know this for a fact
the lady was never sick again.

561
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:16,264
Have you touched it?

562
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:20,296
Not only him... me too...
It was quite big and heavy.

563
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:22,897
Many such things are happening
nowadays.

564
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:31,137
I'm not a follower,
narrating whatever I have seen.

565
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:34,717
If he is so powerful, why does not he
bring peace to the city?

566
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:39,386
Can a sage do everything?

567
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:43,148
But this chap seems hardly human.
He sounds more like a god.

568
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:45,361
And even a god will fail.

569
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:46,922
The city is doomed.

570
00:47:46,997 --> 00:47:48,589
Is there no way out?

571
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:52,631
Yes, if the youth can
be provided with jobs.

572
00:47:52,669 --> 00:47:54,967
Where can you get so many jobs?

573
00:47:55,305 --> 00:47:59,298
After getting jobs, they'll form a union.

574
00:47:59,943 --> 00:48:02,571
Are they talking of jobs?

575
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:12,361
They say the whole system is rotten.
I don't think they want jobs.

576
00:48:12,962 --> 00:48:14,188
They want revolution.

577
00:48:14,189 --> 00:48:15,551
We need a dictator here.

578
00:48:15,552 --> 00:48:20,154
This disbelief among youth
is an international condition.

579
00:48:24,268 --> 00:48:29,604
Following the tradition even 25 years
after independence...

580
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:35,032
Their and our views
about independence are

581
00:48:35,033 --> 00:48:39,046
different. They're the
post-independence generation.

582
00:48:46,356 --> 00:48:48,620
Mallick, why are you silent?

583
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:56,561
You have vast experience.

584
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:01,563
I worship beauty.

585
00:49:01,838 --> 00:49:04,500
I worship properly by sitting down.

586
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,975
Is it worship or something else?

587
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:14,440
A worshipper should sit at the feet...

588
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:18,746
100 times... with pleasure.

589
00:49:29,032 --> 00:49:30,460
Would you like a sherry?

590
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:31,593
I don't need one.

591
00:49:41,378 --> 00:49:43,744
Sir, your parents have come.

592
00:49:46,917 --> 00:49:49,010
Your lifts are automatic.

593
00:49:49,419 --> 00:49:50,478
Yes.

594
00:49:55,859 --> 00:49:59,192
By mistake I pushed the 8th floor.

595
00:50:01,198 --> 00:50:03,894
There I found the name of a Madrasi.

596
00:50:24,321 --> 00:50:26,812
You have so many guests.

597
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:28,717
So what... please sit.

598
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:35,696
I was thinking of coming here for some time.

599
00:50:36,633 --> 00:50:38,066
They are my friends.

600
00:50:38,902 --> 00:50:41,234
My sister Tutul came from Patna.

601
00:50:42,038 --> 00:50:43,370
Did she?

602
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:57,982
She got the M. A. this year.

603
00:50:58,288 --> 00:50:59,877
Let me see...

604
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:02,151
Yes... have some sweets.

605
00:51:02,325 --> 00:51:03,383
Don't bother.

606
00:51:05,862 --> 00:51:07,420
You have grown up.

607
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:09,265
Mother often speaks about you.

608
00:51:16,173 --> 00:51:20,007
Old memories... I think about them.

609
00:51:27,484 --> 00:51:31,011
My sister in-law bet today
for the first time.
