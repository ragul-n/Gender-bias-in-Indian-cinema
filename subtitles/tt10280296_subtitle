00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:58,542
Police!

188
00:28:04,417 --> 00:28:05,708
It is all over!

189
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:07,333
All over!

190
00:28:07,583 --> 00:28:08,583
It is all over.

191
00:28:09,083 --> 00:28:10,833
I shot him! I shot him!

192
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,500
Caxton Hall!

193
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:36,542
Stretcher coming through.

194
00:28:41,208 --> 00:28:42,917
It’s all over, it’s of no use!

195
00:28:43,125 --> 00:28:44,375
It is all over!

196
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:48,375
Check his pulse.

197
00:28:50,792 --> 00:28:52,417
He killed thousands.

198
00:28:53,208 --> 00:28:54,958
He has killed thousands.

199
00:28:56,958 --> 00:28:57,958
It is all over.

200
00:28:58,125 --> 00:28:59,958
[Indistinct murmur]

201
00:29:00,042 --> 00:29:01,833
[Crowd hurling abuses]

202
00:29:31,917 --> 00:29:32,917
-Hello...
-Lady O'Dwyer...

203
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,750
He shouted "Sir Dwyer.”

204
00:29:34,917 --> 00:29:36,250
He fired 6 shots.

205
00:29:36,458 --> 00:29:38,625
[Crying] And the shot...

206
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:40,708
it hit him in the chest.

207
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:42,833
-[Gasps]
-I'm so sorry.

208
00:29:43,875 --> 00:29:46,958
"Sir Michael O’Dwyer, the former
Lieutenant Governor of the Punjab

209
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:49,500
during the time of the Amritsar affair of
1919

210
00:29:49,583 --> 00:29:52,833
was shot dead by an Indian man in London
earlier today.

211
00:29:52,917 --> 00:29:55,917
Sir Michael was addressing a meeting of
the East India Association

212
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,458
presided over by Lord Zetland, the
Secretary of State for India,

213
00:29:59,542 --> 00:30:00,917
who was badly injured.

214
00:30:01,042 --> 00:30:03,333
Former Governors of Punjab and Bombay

215
00:30:03,417 --> 00:30:05,833
Lord Lamington and Sir Louis Dane were
also wounded

216
00:30:05,917 --> 00:30:08,458
and are now receiving emergency treatment
in hospital.

217
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:11,625
The assassin who fired six shots in quick
succession

218
00:30:11,708 --> 00:30:14,083
was immediately apprehended by the
police."

219
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:17,292
He served the British Empire dutifully

220
00:30:17,708 --> 00:30:21,167
in the most turbulent period of time
in the Punjab.

221
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:24,000
between the years 1912 and 1919.

222
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,417
"Germany calling!"

223
00:30:26,917 --> 00:30:28,125
"Germany calling!"

224
00:30:28,917 --> 00:30:30,333
"Germany calling!"

225
00:30:30,833 --> 00:30:33,000
"This is Lord Haw Haw.

226
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:36,417
The sun finally seems to be setting

227
00:30:36,542 --> 00:30:37,917
over the British empire.

228
00:30:38,458 --> 00:30:39,958
Like their elephants,

229
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:43,458
the Indians never forget their enemies.

230
00:30:43,667 --> 00:30:45,083
They strike them down

231
00:30:45,167 --> 00:30:47,458
-even after twenty years."
-Bloody Indians!

232
00:30:47,625 --> 00:30:49,417
Who is behind this murder?

233
00:30:49,583 --> 00:30:51,917
Witnesses have confirmed

234
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,333
that he is a man of Indian origin.

235
00:30:54,625 --> 00:30:55,875
We have recovered a pistol

236
00:30:55,958 --> 00:30:58,958
and live ammunition from him, about nine
rounds.

237
00:30:59,125 --> 00:31:01,917
Further links are being investigated.

238
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:04,875
But we will not tolerate such violence.

239
00:31:05,583 --> 00:31:07,500
Such acts of terrorism.

240
00:31:07,708 --> 00:31:10,083
A cowardice within our country.

241
00:31:10,417 --> 00:31:12,458
We will stand up together

242
00:31:12,875 --> 00:31:15,542
and rise up against brutal crime

243
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,708
and we will crush

244
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:19,083
any movement

245
00:31:19,292 --> 00:31:21,000
against the Empire!

246
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,917
I am absolutely certain...

247
00:31:25,458 --> 00:31:26,958
he won’t name anyone.

248
00:31:27,417 --> 00:31:28,417
But...

249
00:31:29,375 --> 00:31:30,375
he did it!

250
00:31:30,792 --> 00:31:32,208
He was always stubborn.

251
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:33,958
Hats off to him.

252
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:35,792
I mean...

253
00:31:36,625 --> 00:31:39,417
Such coverage by the world press...

254
00:31:39,792 --> 00:31:42,208
no incident has been covered so widely.

255
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:46,250
Reported across 12-15 countries.

256
00:31:46,792 --> 00:31:49,708
Tell me who your other associates are?

257
00:31:53,375 --> 00:31:55,000
[Grunts] [Coughs]

258
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:58,000
What organization do you work for?

259
00:32:00,708 --> 00:32:01,708
[Coughs]

260
00:32:02,458 --> 00:32:03,458
[Groans]

261
00:32:04,875 --> 00:32:06,958
Why did you do this?

262
00:32:08,167 --> 00:32:10,750
Tell me the names of your associates?

263
00:32:13,458 --> 00:32:15,708
[Groans] Uh...

264
00:32:16,958 --> 00:32:20,042
-Who are your associates?
-[Groans]

265
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:28,667
Keep going.

266
00:32:37,625 --> 00:32:39,583
This is the last place he lived?

267
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:40,917
Yes, Sir.

268
00:32:41,458 --> 00:32:43,250
Check underneath the bed.

269
00:32:49,458 --> 00:32:50,458
Sir.

270
00:32:50,667 --> 00:32:51,750
Quite the collection.

271
00:32:53,833 --> 00:32:55,292
Take a look at this, Sir.

272
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,208
Directory.

273
00:33:07,542 --> 00:33:08,542
Hmm...

274
00:33:09,208 --> 00:33:10,667
Caxton Hall.

275
00:33:15,167 --> 00:33:16,167
Alright.

276
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,458
You sure he is the same man?

277
00:33:20,542 --> 00:33:23,208
Yes Sir, we are certain of it, Sir!

278
00:33:23,958 --> 00:33:26,292
Punjab ’39...

279
00:33:26,708 --> 00:33:29,333
Punjab ’33 here we go, this is the one.

280
00:33:38,167 --> 00:33:41,208
Well if he is our man and he came in six
years ago

281
00:33:41,292 --> 00:33:43,458
what the hell has he been doing since
then?

282
00:33:51,833 --> 00:33:53,250
Bring him down.

283
00:33:54,708 --> 00:33:55,917
You are coming with us.

284
00:33:57,125 --> 00:33:58,333
Sit down and shut up!

285
00:33:58,708 --> 00:34:01,500
-Who all have come from India?
-Sir, I did.

286
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,833
-When did you enter England?
-In January.

287
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:06,083
Show me your passport!

288
00:34:09,042 --> 00:34:11,417
What do you know about this Sher Singh?

289
00:34:21,917 --> 00:34:23,083
On your feet.

290
00:34:23,708 --> 00:34:25,250
Are you Surat Ali?

291
00:34:29,583 --> 00:34:30,833
Mr. Koppikar...

292
00:34:31,542 --> 00:34:33,750
-do you know this man?
-Yes.

293
00:34:34,167 --> 00:34:37,167
I had nothing to do with this killing.
He did it alone.

294
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,375
You deny your links to the Communist
party?

295
00:34:39,458 --> 00:34:40,792
[Exhales] No.

296
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:44,042
So, he met you quite a few times this
umm...?

297
00:34:44,167 --> 00:34:47,167
Yes, at the Sikh temple, a couple of times
may be.

298
00:34:47,875 --> 00:34:48,875
Just a couple?

299
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:50,958
Maybe more, I don’t remember.

300
00:34:51,333 --> 00:34:53,500
-How did he get the gun?
-I don’t know.

301
00:34:53,708 --> 00:34:54,917
You don’t know?

302
00:34:57,833 --> 00:34:58,958
That’s all?

303
00:34:59,875 --> 00:35:01,083
Yes, that’s all.

304
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,583
You will have to come with us, Sir.

305
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:12,750
He is a small time businessman...

306
00:35:13,708 --> 00:35:15,292
his name is Bawa.

307
00:35:15,667 --> 00:35:17,167
Fond of 'laddoos'...

308
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,083
I mean sweets.

309
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:22,708
Very passionate about India’s
independence.

310
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,375
What else?

311
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:28,167
I told you, Sir. He used to visit
the Sikh temple sometimes.

312
00:35:28,958 --> 00:35:31,542
Cut this nonsense. What else?

313
00:35:33,292 --> 00:35:35,208
I don’t know much about him.

314
00:35:42,542 --> 00:35:44,625
Right, so what have we got?

315
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:47,250
Well, we figured out he worked

316
00:35:47,375 --> 00:35:49,667
in a cotton mill in the Punjab…

317
00:35:49,958 --> 00:35:51,958
in about 1919.

318
00:35:52,125 --> 00:35:54,000
-Any Family?
-An orphan.

319
00:35:54,333 --> 00:35:57,417
His mother died when he was six.
His father soon after that.

320
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:01,250
He and his brother, Ude, they grew up in
an orphanage.

321
00:36:02,792 --> 00:36:03,792
Any other relatives?

322
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:07,042
Some cousins, but we are not sure yet.

323
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:10,208
Immigration records show he entered London

324
00:36:10,292 --> 00:36:12,500
several times since 1933

325
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,958
using different names, Sher singh, Ude
Singh,

326
00:36:17,083 --> 00:36:21,125
Udham Singh, Azad singh and Frank Brazil.

327
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:24,792
He first settled in a small apartment in
East London,

328
00:36:24,958 --> 00:36:28,083
and constantly shifted residences
almost every 6 months,

329
00:36:28,167 --> 00:36:31,917
-from the East across to the Southwest, at
Bournemouth. -Yeah.

330
00:36:32,708 --> 00:36:35,875
While here...he tried to organize
an international network

331
00:36:35,958 --> 00:36:37,875
of rebels for the Ghadr party

332
00:36:38,083 --> 00:36:40,833
making contact with sources across
Europe.

333
00:36:42,458 --> 00:36:46,250
There is a police complaint against him in
1937

334
00:36:46,333 --> 00:36:50,542
for publicly beating another Indian in a
brawl in a bar in South London.

335
00:36:53,208 --> 00:36:56,292
He obtained a local peddler's
license working odd jobs

336
00:36:56,375 --> 00:36:57,917
as a stationery salesman,

337
00:36:58,292 --> 00:37:00,583
also as an extra on a movie set.

338
00:37:00,667 --> 00:37:01,833
I am a salesman.

339
00:37:01,917 --> 00:37:05,917
Sometime later, he is spotted at a
flea market selling lingerie,

340
00:37:06,292 --> 00:37:09,042
and he owns a Fiat car by now…

341
00:37:09,958 --> 00:37:13,000
our last entry in the records show
him working as a welder

342
00:37:13,083 --> 00:37:15,167
in an iron factory in East London.

343
00:37:15,792 --> 00:37:17,583
This was about 6 months

344
00:37:17,667 --> 00:37:19,125
before the assassination.

345
00:37:35,667 --> 00:37:37,833
I heard this man was under our watch!

346
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:39,542
How did he slip through?

347
00:37:39,708 --> 00:37:44,000
Well, he was put under watch nine years
ago Sir, when he left prison in India...

348
00:37:44,083 --> 00:37:48,042
and in that time he basically kept his
head down and we lost track of him.

349
00:37:48,375 --> 00:37:51,583
Few weeks ago we had a
tip off from the passport office,

350
00:37:52,167 --> 00:37:55,042
but by the time we had
got there, he had already fled.

351
00:37:55,167 --> 00:37:58,542
Are there any other conspirators?
Any other associates?

352
00:37:59,333 --> 00:38:02,042
There may be others waiting
to strike at high level targets.

353
00:38:02,833 --> 00:38:04,292
Have a look at the Germans,

354
00:38:04,708 --> 00:38:07,833
-we can’t take any chances.
-Sir.

355
00:38:08,083 --> 00:38:10,000
-[Groans]
-Who are you?

356
00:38:10,625 --> 00:38:12,167
What is your name?

357
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:14,458
When is the next attack gonna happen?

358
00:38:20,625 --> 00:38:22,333
You thought you got them all...

359
00:38:22,625 --> 00:38:23,667
didn’t you?

360
00:38:25,042 --> 00:38:26,458
Well you didn’t!

361
00:38:30,042 --> 00:38:31,333
Only four bullets?

362
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,583
I had pumped in all six.

363
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:37,208
Zetland is also dead, right?

364
00:38:37,292 --> 00:38:39,208
He said he fired six times.

365
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:40,833
Isn’t Zetland dead?

366
00:38:42,125 --> 00:38:43,500
Only O'Dwyer?

367
00:38:49,167 --> 00:38:50,625

So you admit that you know him?

474
00:45:50,333 --> 00:45:53,458
You surely knew he was a wanted man before
he came to England.

just a friend or...

487
00:46:22,417 --> 00:46:24,167

00:51:15,125 --> 00:51:17,083
In fact he was erratic,

554
00:51:17,583 --> 00:51:19,458
somewhat capricious.

555
00:51:19,833 --> 00:51:21,833
While he was here,

556
00:51:22,417 --> 00:51:25,583
he made a deal between the IRA and
the Indian rebels...

557
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,250
for arms...

558
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:30,042
fortunately we intercepted that shipment.

559
00:51:31,458 --> 00:51:32,958
Are you aware of that?

560
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:36,333
"British police have foiled an
arms conspiracy

561
00:51:36,417 --> 00:51:38,125
between Irish and Indian rebels

562
00:51:38,208 --> 00:51:40,833
after a major consignment containing
grenades,

563
00:51:40,917 --> 00:51:42,833
rifles and pistols was intercepted

564
00:51:42,917 --> 00:51:45,292
at the port of Calcutta, in
Northern India.

565
00:51:45,375 --> 00:51:49,958
Links with the banned revolutionary group,
the IRA are being investigated..."

566
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,542
How did this blunder happen?

567
00:51:55,208 --> 00:51:57,500
Were your contacts trustworthy?

568
00:51:58,417 --> 00:52:00,125
The leak was internal...

569
00:52:04,542 --> 00:52:05,542
Now?

570
00:52:05,875 --> 00:52:08,125
Surveillance on us has increased,

571
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:10,125
there have been raids in Ireland.

572
00:52:10,208 --> 00:52:11,792
Staying here is risky.

573
00:52:11,875 --> 00:52:15,083
Leave for Russia immediately.

574
00:52:35,375 --> 00:52:36,708
You be safe.

575
00:52:38,458 --> 00:52:40,917
And thank you, for helping.

576
00:52:55,375 --> 00:52:57,417
You are not going to come back?

577
00:52:58,708 --> 00:53:00,458
I will continue my fight.

578
00:53:10,583 --> 00:53:12,375
There is a re-entry here

579
00:53:12,458 --> 00:53:14,208
under the name of

580
00:53:14,542 --> 00:53:16,125
Ude Singh, is that you?

581
00:53:21,792 --> 00:53:26,167
We have confirmation now that you
re-entered from Russia.

582
00:53:28,708 --> 00:53:29,792
Who did you meet?

583
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:31,250
The Red Army?

584
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:34,000
The communist politburo?

585
00:53:34,292 --> 00:53:36,333
Another arms deal perhaps?

586
00:53:36,917 --> 00:53:39,125
Where was the delivery planned...hmm?

587
00:53:39,417 --> 00:53:42,000
Here in London or was it Spain?

588
00:53:43,292 --> 00:53:45,458
Is that why you travelled to Spain
from Russia?

589
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:49,625
To support the communists in their civil
war?

590
00:53:49,708 --> 00:53:53,333
[Speaks Russian]

591
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:54,542
But...

592
00:53:55,208 --> 00:53:58,792
without the support
of an anti-colonial country like yours

593
00:53:59,375 --> 00:54:00,792
Who would listen to us?

594
00:54:00,917 --> 00:54:02,667
You are a world power...

595
00:54:03,542 --> 00:54:07,917
it is vital that you intervene
against the imperialist British.

596
00:54:08,125 --> 00:54:11,792
Our comrades don’t have weapons,
how will they fight?

597
00:54:11,958 --> 00:54:13,375
We need weapons.

598
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,375
We will discuss with the Politburo,

599
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:25,583
and I assure you that the Soviet Union is
with you.

600
00:54:28,917 --> 00:54:31,792
But we are busy preparing for war

601
00:54:32,083 --> 00:54:34,542
and now is not a good time for us.

602
00:54:43,625 --> 00:54:45,750
So, what else were you planning
then?

603
00:54:46,667 --> 00:54:49,208
A little bombing campaign perhaps?

604
00:54:49,542 --> 00:54:52,917
Did you go to Russia and Germany? Who did
you meet there?

605
00:54:53,917 --> 00:54:56,333
Did you really think that the Nazis
and the Russians...

606
00:54:56,417 --> 00:54:59,458
would lend a helping
hand and we would just stand idly by?

607
00:54:59,542 --> 00:55:00,542
[Chuckles]

608
00:55:00,708 --> 00:55:04,250
You want us to believe
that you came back only for O'Dwyer?

609
00:55:04,333 --> 00:55:05,333
Hmm?

610
00:55:18,167 --> 00:55:19,167
Yes?

611
00:55:22,208 --> 00:55:24,208
He lives near Kensington Gardens.

612
00:55:25,292 --> 00:55:26,792
Visits church on Mondays.

613
00:55:28,083 --> 00:55:29,750
Cinema hall on Fridays.

614
00:55:30,875 --> 00:55:32,708
And the club on Saturdays.

615
00:55:33,958 --> 00:55:36,292
-Sure it is him?
-I've seen him.

616
00:56:17,042 --> 00:56:19,208
So Michael, I'll see you at 12 o’clock.

617
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:35,167
[Laughter]

618
00:56:53,042 --> 00:56:55,875
And so ladies and gentlemen,
we come to Amritsar.

619
00:56:56,333 --> 00:56:59,042
And inevitably if we come to Amritsar,

620
00:56:59,125 --> 00:57:01,667
we talk about General Dyer.

621
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:04,167
Now one knows the authorities’ opinion

622
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:06,292
of General Dyer and so did he.

623
00:57:06,958 --> 00:57:09,458
He died a broken man,

624
00:57:09,875 --> 00:57:11,375
but unrepented.

625
00:57:11,667 --> 00:57:14,500
And I have no hesitation in saying

626
00:57:14,917 --> 00:57:17,417
that General Dyer’s action that day

627
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,542
was the decisive factor

628
00:57:19,625 --> 00:57:21,208
in crushing the rebellion.

629
00:57:21,292 --> 00:57:24,917
[Crowd clapping]

630
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:27,417
The seriousness, the seriousness

631
00:57:27,625 --> 00:57:29,917
of which is now generally realized.

632
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,167
But the Hunter commission

633
00:57:31,375 --> 00:57:33,667
would not hear a word of evidence

634
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:38,250
to say that the Punjab rebellion was
connected in any way whatsoever

635
00:57:38,333 --> 00:57:39,917
to the Afghan invasion.

636
00:57:40,083 --> 00:57:41,708
The Indian Congress

637
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:46,500
made a report that's called the Indian
Congress Report on the Punjab.

638
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,167
Most of it written by Gandhi.
And in that he says...

639
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:53,208
that it was my intention to crush...

640
00:57:53,417 --> 00:57:56,292
political consciousness in India.

641
00:57:56,458 --> 00:57:58,167
No Mr. Gandhi...

642
00:57:58,667 --> 00:58:00,000
my intention...

643
00:58:00,333 --> 00:58:02,958
was to crush lawlessness...and rebellion!

644
00:58:03,125 --> 00:58:05,167
[Crowd clapping]

645
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:06,250
[Gunshot]

646
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:18,125
[Breathing heavily]

647
00:58:21,958 --> 00:58:23,292
[Gunshot]

648
00:59:07,417 --> 00:59:08,500
Exquisite!

649
00:59:10,583 --> 00:59:12,208
How much for the box?

650
00:59:13,625 --> 00:59:14,708
Free, Sir.

651
00:59:15,292 --> 00:59:17,083
-Free?
-For you.

652
00:59:18,375 --> 00:59:20,042
-For me?
-Yes. Ah...

653
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:21,750
I...

654
00:59:22,833 --> 00:59:25,625
I know you, Sir. I served below you.

655
00:59:26,583 --> 00:59:28,833
You were the Governor, I...

656
00:59:29,208 --> 00:59:31,542
I was a worker at the factory...

657
00:59:31,625 --> 00:59:33,250
Railways...India!

658
00:59:34,042 --> 00:59:36,000
India...ah...Thank you, Emma!

659
00:59:36,792 --> 00:59:38,292
India...hmm...

660
00:59:39,792 --> 00:59:43,167
That’s a trait I have always
admired in the Indians.

661
00:59:43,875 --> 00:59:45,750
The willingness to please.

662
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:49,000
India huh! Awful weather,

663
00:59:49,583 --> 00:59:50,875
terrible food.

664
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,458
Never bothered to learn the language.

665
00:59:53,542 --> 00:59:56,125
But I served the crown well in India.

666
00:59:56,333 --> 00:59:57,917
Now, the ordinary people...

667
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,083
the common people,
the peasants, they liked us.

668
01:00:01,583 --> 01:00:03,417
Never had any trouble with us!

669
01:00:04,167 --> 01:00:06,042
-But the educated...
-Sir...

670
01:00:06,708 --> 01:00:11,042
some of my friends...not me, friends,
students...

671
01:00:11,583 --> 01:00:14,125
they protested along with the commoners.

672
01:00:14,708 --> 01:00:15,708
Students...

673
01:00:16,042 --> 01:00:17,042
communists...

674
01:00:17,625 --> 01:00:19,500
they incited the common people...

675
01:00:19,792 --> 01:00:21,667
they instigated the rebellion.

676
01:00:23,417 --> 01:00:25,292
I am also educated, Sir.

677
01:00:26,708 --> 01:00:28,250
But you seem rational.

678
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:32,625
You are here, in the heart
of the British Empire...

679
01:00:32,708 --> 01:00:36,292
making a good, honest, lawful living like
us.

680
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,750
You’ll make a good salesman.

681
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:42,958
Thank you, Sir.

682
01:01:03,542 --> 01:01:05,167
H.S.R.A.

683
01:01:05,458 --> 01:01:08,583
Hindustan Socialist Republican
Association.

684
01:01:08,667 --> 01:01:11,083
Is this organization still active?

685
01:01:12,792 --> 01:01:15,250
HSRA...you used to be a member!

686
01:01:18,375 --> 01:01:19,708
Is Koppikar or...

687
01:01:19,875 --> 01:01:22,917
S.S. Johal a member? Hmm?

688
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:25,917
You were associated with Bhagat
Singh too, didn’t you?

689
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,500
Don’t talk about Bhagat Singh!

690
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:30,042
He says let’s not talk about him.

691
01:01:31,167 --> 01:01:33,625
I have your whole history here...

692
01:01:34,750 --> 01:01:36,417
you might as well tell me.

693
01:01:37,792 --> 01:01:38,792
Now wake up man!

694
01:01:38,875 --> 01:01:42,250
They are not going to let
you walk away from this, this time!

695
01:01:42,333 --> 01:01:45,458
They are going to hang
you like they did Bhagat Singh!

696
01:01:49,583 --> 01:01:51,292
They call us 'Rebels'...

697
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,333
If asking for your rights, is being
rebellious…

698
01:01:55,333 --> 01:01:57,750
then, yes, we are rebels!

699
01:01:58,458 --> 01:02:00,208
That was earlier,

700
01:02:00,708 --> 01:02:02,833
now they label us ‘Terrorists!’

701
01:02:03,292 --> 01:02:06,417
There is a difference between
a terrorist and a revolutionary...

702
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:07,875
A significant difference!

703
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,292
A revolutionary's action is symbolic

704
01:02:12,958 --> 01:02:15,042
meant to register a protest.

705
01:02:15,625 --> 01:02:18,625
Their motive is not to create fear.

706
01:02:19,708 --> 01:02:23,000
On the contrary, they inspire

707
01:02:23,417 --> 01:02:24,750
to fight for rights!

708
01:02:25,125 --> 01:02:26,500
People's own rights!

709
01:02:27,125 --> 01:02:30,167
Purpose of a revolutionary

710
01:02:30,333 --> 01:02:32,375
is to fight for freedom.

711
01:02:32,583 --> 01:02:34,042
And freedom for all!

712
01:02:34,625 --> 01:02:39,042
A true revolutionary has to follow
certain tenets.

713
01:02:40,083 --> 01:02:41,458
You cannot be prejudiced,

714
01:02:41,792 --> 01:02:43,000
nor communal,

715
01:02:43,625 --> 01:02:45,000
nor casteist.

716
01:02:46,167 --> 01:02:48,208
There is no economic or social class
difference.

717
01:02:48,625 --> 01:02:50,125
The only truth...

718
01:02:51,333 --> 01:02:53,583
is equality.

719
01:02:54,375 --> 01:02:55,375
Equality!

720
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:58,125
To treat all humans as equals,

721
01:02:58,250 --> 01:02:59,958
with a strong belief in humanity!

722
01:03:01,167 --> 01:03:04,292
There is a significant difference,
brother!

723
01:03:04,708 --> 01:03:06,750
-Yes, understood.
-Okay, Bhagat...

724
01:03:07,458 --> 01:03:09,875
after freedom; what first?

725
01:03:10,125 --> 01:03:11,333
Oh! After freedom...

726
01:03:12,833 --> 01:03:15,625
I will watch a Chaplin film,

727
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:18,042
buy an expensive British wine...

728
01:03:18,167 --> 01:03:19,167
and…

729
01:03:20,333 --> 01:03:21,333
-Ma'am
-Me?

730
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,708
With a English lady by my side...

731
01:03:23,792 --> 01:03:26,458
I will do the ball dance. [Laughter]

732
01:03:28,375 --> 01:03:30,833
…then just eat and sleep.

733
01:03:30,958 --> 01:03:32,792
[Laughter]

734
01:03:33,125 --> 01:03:34,583
Then get up in the morning

735
01:03:35,583 --> 01:03:36,583
have a bath...

736
01:03:36,917 --> 01:03:39,500
-and repeat the routine...
-[Laughter]

737
01:03:42,167 --> 01:03:43,167
Ask him...

738
01:03:44,417 --> 01:03:46,750
what was he doing when he was 23?

739
01:03:48,917 --> 01:03:52,708
He is asking what you were doing
when you were 23?

740
01:03:55,375 --> 01:03:57,292
What was I doing when I was 23...

741
01:03:59,333 --> 01:04:00,333
Tell me.

742
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,875
I was just married.

743
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:10,333
We were expecting our first born.

744
01:04:12,292 --> 01:04:13,792
I was the...

745
01:04:15,458 --> 01:04:18,333
youngest detective constable on the force.

746
01:04:19,875 --> 01:04:21,125
Happy days!

747
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Hmm...

748
01:04:26,375 --> 01:04:28,833
So don’t talk about Bhagat Singh!

749
01:04:30,583 --> 01:04:32,333
You know nothing about him.

750
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:35,125
"The two men responsible for throwing
bombs

751
01:04:35,208 --> 01:04:37,042
at the central assembly hall in Delhi

752
01:04:37,167 --> 01:04:40,667
have been identified as
Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt,

753
01:04:40,833 --> 01:04:44,333
both belonging to the Hindustan Socialist
Republican Association.

754
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:47,375
Shouting slogans like
‘Long live the revolution,’

755
01:04:47,458 --> 01:04:50,625
‘Down with imperialism’ and
‘Workers of the world unite,’

756
01:04:50,833 --> 01:04:54,542
Both men did not flee after
the act but willingly courted arrest.

757
01:04:54,625 --> 01:04:57,667
Throwing pamphlets that cited
their rationale for the bombing,

758
01:04:57,750 --> 01:04:59,458
"To make the deaf hear."

759
01:04:59,667 --> 01:05:01,542
With the Labour party watching closely

760
01:05:01,625 --> 01:05:04,542
the ruling Conservatives have
decided to order strict

761
01:05:04,625 --> 01:05:07,250
prosecution of the members of
the revolutionary outfit,

762
01:05:07,333 --> 01:05:08,958
H.S.R.A.

763
01:05:09,042 --> 01:05:10,292
In a nationwide strike,

764
01:05:10,417 --> 01:05:13,000
police have successfully raided
suspected hideouts

765
01:05:13,083 --> 01:05:14,667
in Lahore and Saharanpur,

766
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:15,750
killing several members

767
01:05:15,833 --> 01:05:17,583
and arresting some prominent ones

768
01:05:17,667 --> 01:05:19,667
including Sukhdev and Rajguru,

769
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:22,292
both wanted as conspirators
in the Saunders murder case

770
01:05:22,375 --> 01:05:24,292
along with Bhagat Singh himself."

771
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,208
"They may...

772
01:05:27,125 --> 01:05:28,708
kill me...

773
01:05:29,333 --> 01:05:30,958
But cannot kill my ideas.

774
01:05:32,333 --> 01:05:35,000
An ideology whose time has come

775
01:05:35,375 --> 01:05:37,208
is unstoppable.

776
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,333
You will never earn your rights, unless

777
01:05:42,125 --> 01:05:43,875
you rise up in protest

778
01:05:44,292 --> 01:05:45,833
or fight the oppressors.

779
01:05:45,917 --> 01:05:48,875
Independence without...

780
01:05:49,458 --> 01:05:51,792
a true ideology...

781
01:05:52,750 --> 01:05:54,917
can be worse than slavery.

782
01:05:56,625 --> 01:06:00,708
Freedom is our birth right...

783
01:06:00,792 --> 01:06:03,167
and therefore

784
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:07,167
we reject this oppressive regime.

785
01:06:20,917 --> 01:06:24,083
And for the criticism of resorting
to violence.

786
01:06:24,417 --> 01:06:27,125
We are not blood thirsty,

787
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:31,000
we do not harbour hate toward any
individual or country.

788
01:06:31,083 --> 01:06:35,500
We are simply against
the exploitation of one by the other.

789
01:06:35,958 --> 01:06:37,333
Most importantly...

790
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:40,833
we do not want our rights in piecemeal.

791
01:06:41,917 --> 01:06:45,500
Neither the illusion of semi-independence.

792
01:06:45,583 --> 01:06:48,875
We want the welfare of the entire world...

793

farmers, workers and students…

794
01:06:53,208 --> 01:06:55,000
and therefore we demand...

795
01:06:55,125 --> 01:06:56,500
absolute independence...

796
01:06:57,417 --> 01:06:59,167
and a total revolution!"

797
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:03,583
He's been quite for some time now,
Sir.

798
01:07:03,667 --> 01:07:04,667
And?

799
01:07:05,458 --> 01:07:07,167
Well I certainly think he is a

800
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:08,542
committed Marxist.

801
01:07:08,875 --> 01:07:11,042
Very ideologically driven, Sir.

802
01:07:11,333 --> 01:07:12,583
Hasn’t named anyone as yet.

803
01:07:12,792 --> 01:07:16,083
We need to get him to confess.
Press charges.

804
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:18,708
Get him to talk.

805
01:07:20,042 --> 01:07:21,625
Do what it takes.

806
01:07:22,125 --> 01:07:23,125
Sir.

807
01:07:38,125 --> 01:07:39,125
So then...

808
01:07:40,625 --> 01:07:42,167
between you and me...

809
01:07:43,667 --> 01:07:45,875
what’s your real name? Hmm?

810
01:07:47,042 --> 01:07:50,667
Oh, there’s so many passports!
And aliases.

811
01:07:51,083 --> 01:07:52,083
Frank Brazil?

812
01:07:52,917 --> 01:07:53,917
Is this you?

813
01:07:55,542 --> 01:07:56,542
Hmm?

814
01:07:57,458 --> 01:08:00,125
-Yes!
-[Chuckles]

815
01:08:02,042 --> 01:08:04,458
Well then according to this...

[Clears throat]

in Bournemouth in 1933…

818
01:08:10,875 --> 01:08:12,292
you are Udham Singh.

819
01:08:15,250 --> 01:08:16,250
Yes.

820
01:08:17,292 --> 01:08:19,417
You haven’t got a lot of time left.

821
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:21,750
It’s important for your own sake...

822
01:08:22,708 --> 01:08:25,750
that we know what your real name is.

823
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:28,250
Hmm?

824
01:08:40,458 --> 01:08:42,917
Ram Mohammed Singh Azad.

825
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,000
The decision of tattooing his name
on his body

826
01:09:01,125 --> 01:09:04,875
specifically this name,
Ram Mohammed Singh Azad,

827
01:09:05,208 --> 01:09:09,000
he definitely wanted it discovered
and for that news to be spread.

828
01:09:09,625 --> 01:09:11,500
What is the meaning of this?

829
01:09:11,583 --> 01:09:12,583
Uh...

830
01:09:12,667 --> 01:09:14,167
Sir, it is [Clears throat]

831
01:09:14,667 --> 01:09:16,000
symbolic of...

832
01:09:16,458 --> 01:09:18,208
Indian religious unity.

833
01:09:23,292 --> 01:09:25,333
We need to control the press.

834
01:09:26,667 --> 01:09:28,250
No matter what we do...

835
01:09:28,833 --> 01:09:31,625
there will be many who will...

836
01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:33,833
see his actions...

837
01:09:35,042 --> 01:09:36,917
as an act of revolution, Sir!

838
01:09:45,333 --> 01:09:47,250
I said it at that time...

839
01:09:48,583 --> 01:09:50,458
Dwyer was responsible...

840
01:09:50,625 --> 01:09:52,500
for a monstrous event.

841
01:09:53,250 --> 01:09:54,833
But we cannot allow that

842
01:09:54,917 --> 01:09:56,833
to affect our decision making.

843
01:09:57,083 --> 01:09:59,167
Yes, Prime Minister.

844
01:09:59,542 --> 01:10:02,333
His defence lawyers will try and stall.

845
01:10:02,917 --> 01:10:05,792
-But we should speed things up.
-Sir.

846
01:10:07,625 --> 01:10:09,625
This business has to be ended here.

847
01:10:11,125 --> 01:10:14,292
-I agree...
-India protests every day.

848
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,375
We don’t get to see it thankfully.

849
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:23,000
But London must not protest anymore…

850
01:10:24,417 --> 01:10:27,625
and prolonging this trial will only ensure
that.

851
01:10:33,083 --> 01:10:34,167
Good morning, Sir!

852
01:10:38,708 --> 01:10:39,958
Your Majesty...

853
01:10:41,083 --> 01:10:42,833
There are a...

854
01:10:43,667 --> 01:10:44,667
lot...

855
01:10:45,375 --> 01:10:48,667
of Indian soldiers fighting for us in this
war.

856
01:10:49,250 --> 01:10:51,250
Are there not, Prime Minister?

857
01:10:51,542 --> 01:10:52,833
Yes there are.

858
01:10:54,125 --> 01:10:55,792
A meek surrender...

859
01:10:56,208 --> 01:10:57,625
to this mad man...

860
01:10:58,542 --> 01:11:01,875
would be to embolden the voices of
rebellion...

861
01:11:02,208 --> 01:11:04,125
amongst the Indian soldiers.

862
01:11:06,083 --> 01:11:10,292
We can’t afford to be seen as, as weak.

863
01:11:12,958 --> 01:11:14,208
I understand.

864
01:11:15,042 --> 01:11:16,417
Your Majesty!

865
01:11:18,708 --> 01:11:20,125
After the war...

866
01:11:22,792 --> 01:11:24,750
will the crown...

867
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:27,458
quit India?

868
01:11:30,708 --> 01:11:32,500
Let us just say…

869
01:11:33,667 --> 01:11:35,958
we will need to reinvent...

870
01:11:37,042 --> 01:11:40,667
a way of maintaining our strategic
presence...

871
01:11:41,417 --> 01:11:43,083
in the subcontinent.

872
01:11:51,583 --> 01:11:54,667
We have a terrorist and a lunatic...

873
01:11:55,292 --> 01:11:58,000
...who had no special aim or purpose.

874
01:11:58,292 --> 01:12:01,667
It was a crazed violent attack...

875
01:12:01,917 --> 01:12:02,917
and nothing else.

876
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,042
Sir, is this incident a threat to the
British Empire?

877
01:12:06,333 --> 01:12:07,333
No...

878
01:12:07,542 --> 01:12:09,417
this is a stray incident...

879
01:12:09,542 --> 01:12:11,250
by a crazed lunatic...

880
01:12:11,667 --> 01:12:13,667
who has no further links.

881
01:12:47,833 --> 01:12:49,667

883
01:13:46,792 --> 01:13:48,750
Is anyone alive?

[Factory siren]

885
01:14:05,875 --> 01:14:07,125
See you tomorrow.

886
01:14:22,292 --> 01:14:23,917
What are you doing here?

887
01:14:24,542 --> 01:14:26,125
You'll get me in trouble.

888
01:14:26,625 --> 01:14:28,458
Come here.

889
01:14:30,958 --> 01:14:32,375
How did you get here?

890
01:14:56,833 --> 01:14:58,500
You want to run it?

891
01:15:02,750 --> 01:15:03,750
Hey...

892
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:04,833
come on.

893
01:15:05,417 --> 01:15:06,417
Pull.

894
01:15:11,083 --> 01:15:12,917
Hold the belt and pull upwards.

895
01:15:13,083 --> 01:15:14,792
No, no...upwards.

896
01:15:21,125 --> 01:15:22,458
Come here...

897
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,750
Hey, I was just joking...
give me your hand.

898
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Thank you.

899

Support for Udham Singh.

900
01:16:00,417 --> 01:16:02,125
Long live Udham.

901
01:16:19,542 --> 01:16:20,792
Mr. Nihal Singh?

902
01:16:21,542 --> 01:16:22,542
Yes.

903
01:16:22,792 --> 01:16:25,167
So, he tried to kill your supervisor?

904
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,583
No, just...

905
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,958
raised his voice.

906
01:16:33,667 --> 01:16:34,917
Threatened him.

907
01:16:35,292 --> 01:16:37,708
Well, it still shows clear criminal
intent.

908
01:16:39,208 --> 01:16:40,208
No...

909
01:16:41,458 --> 01:16:42,500
not…

910
01:16:43,375 --> 01:16:44,583
not criminal.

911
01:16:44,917 --> 01:16:47,750
You just said he threatened him.

912
01:16:48,583 --> 01:16:49,583
Hmm?

913
01:16:51,417 --> 01:16:52,583
He was...

914
01:16:53,792 --> 01:16:56,333
somewhat unpredictable...

915
01:16:57,167 --> 01:17:00,792
he would talk about an Utopian world,
but never...

918
01:17:08,333 --> 01:17:09,583

920
01:17:18,083 --> 01:17:20,667
Well, you must really hate the British!

-Do you hate the British?
-No

922
01:17:26,167 --> 01:17:29,917

I don’t hate them.

01:17:34,167 --> 01:17:35,500
Then O’Dwyer?

925
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,958
So was it just revenge?

926
01:17:45,250 --> 01:17:46,250
No.

927
01:17:47,375 --> 01:17:49,375
Michael O’Dwyer...

928
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:55,417
personified the evil of
British imperialism.

929
01:17:57,625 --> 01:17:59,208
I am against that evil!

930
01:17:59,667 --> 01:18:03,458
O’Dwyer embodied British
imperialism in my country.

931
01:18:03,833 --> 01:18:05,917
You too are...

932
01:18:06,833 --> 01:18:08,917
working for your government,

933
01:18:09,917 --> 01:18:11,750
but in your own country.

934
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:15,417
I don’t hate you.

935
01:18:16,583 --> 01:18:18,292
You are doing your job.

936
01:18:22,708 --> 01:18:25,292
[Muffled cry]

937
01:18:25,458 --> 01:18:27,125
[Gasps]

938
01:18:35,583 --> 01:18:37,042
[Coughs]

939
01:18:39,250 --> 01:18:40,667
[Gasping]

940
01:18:42,083 --> 01:18:43,500
Sign your confession.

941
01:18:44,208 --> 01:18:47,958
Write down that you helped
him purchase the guns twice.

942
01:18:48,083 --> 01:18:50,542
You helped him buy the guns...Sign it!

943
01:18:50,625 --> 01:18:53,083
He is a criminal. He had guns.

944
01:18:57,583 --> 01:18:59,667
I’ll ask you for the last time...

945
01:19:30,208 --> 01:19:31,208
[Gunshot]

946
01:19:44,833 --> 01:19:45,833
Stand up!

947
01:19:46,917 --> 01:19:47,917
Stand up…

948
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:52,500
Good morning.

949
01:19:53,917 --> 01:19:55,750
My name is John Hutchison.

950
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:58,167
These are my credentials.

951
01:19:58,625 --> 01:20:00,625
Robert Clayton and Sons.

952
01:20:01,167 --> 01:20:04,125
V.K. Menon will also be with me in the
court.

953
01:20:05,083 --> 01:20:06,083
Hmm!

954
01:20:07,208 --> 01:20:08,583
I was born in...

955
01:20:09,208 --> 01:20:10,708
Kanpur.

956
01:20:12,208 --> 01:20:14,375
I studied law after coming here.

957
01:20:14,625 --> 01:20:15,750
Law?

958
01:20:16,708 --> 01:20:17,958
Huh…

959
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,042
law…

960
01:20:21,917 --> 01:20:26,375
When a country punishes a person, you
quote the law...

961
01:20:29,083 --> 01:20:32,875
but when a country commits
crime against another country

962
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,958
would your law call it a crime?

963
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:41,000
The British have committed a crime!

964
01:20:42,375 --> 01:20:44,167
And continue to do so.

965
01:20:45,667 --> 01:20:49,292
Mr. Singh, I know you think
you don’t need a lawyer.

966
01:20:57,167 --> 01:20:59,583
You will have to co-operate,

967
01:20:59,792 --> 01:21:03,083
if you want me to present your defence.

968
01:21:07,167 --> 01:21:09,083
So, let’s start from the beginning.

969
01:21:10,958 --> 01:21:13,500
When did you plan the assassination?

970
01:21:15,958 --> 01:21:19,833
When did you plan the assassination?

971
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:22,708
It's important that they read
back that sermon next week…

972
01:21:22,792 --> 01:21:25,667
but anyway Richard, it’s good to see you,
I'll see on Sunday.

973
01:21:25,750 --> 01:21:28,167
-Good luck!
-See you next week, Sir Michael.

974
01:21:32,083 --> 01:21:33,083
Salesman,

975
01:21:33,292 --> 01:21:35,125
where’s your box? Where’s your pens?

976
01:21:35,208 --> 01:21:36,208
Ah,

977
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:39,292
not everyone has taste like you, Sir.

978
01:21:39,458 --> 01:21:42,042
Uh-huh! You ought to be selling rifles.

979
01:21:42,125 --> 01:21:44,500
There’s a war coming, money to be made.

980
01:21:44,583 --> 01:21:47,333
Ah...I need a job, Sir.

981
01:21:49,708 --> 01:21:50,708
What do you do?

982
01:21:50,958 --> 01:21:53,208
I am a good carpenter…

983
01:21:53,792 --> 01:21:56,625
a good electrician, I can
wash clothes...

984
01:21:56,792 --> 01:21:58,458
-I...
-Okay, okay.

985
01:21:59,083 --> 01:22:00,625
Come around to the house.

986
01:22:01,083 --> 01:22:03,250
We will see what we can do for you.

987
01:22:03,375 --> 01:22:04,375
Okay?

988
01:22:07,250 --> 01:22:08,917
Grateful, Sir. Thank you.

989
01:22:15,375 --> 01:22:19,208
I’ll be meeting Tony and Slanders at the
club this evening you know.

990
01:22:19,292 --> 01:22:21,375
-I'll give them your love.
-Yes, please do.

991
01:22:21,458 --> 01:22:23,125
Aren’t they pretty flowers now?

992
01:22:23,667 --> 01:22:25,250
They are fresh from the garden.

993
01:22:25,708 --> 01:22:27,042
Got the hunt on Monday.

994
01:22:27,167 --> 01:22:28,250
Ah, yes of course.

995
01:22:28,333 --> 01:22:30,542
You fancy rabbits on Tuesday night, huh?

996
01:22:30,625 --> 01:22:33,125
-It'll be Monday night.
-That will be lovely.

997
01:23:04,792 --> 01:23:05,792
Sir.

998
01:23:07,250 --> 01:23:08,250
Thank you.

999
01:23:13,083 --> 01:23:14,083
Now…

1000
01:23:37,542 --> 01:23:39,375
Got him! Got him!

1001
01:23:45,917 --> 01:23:46,917
Thank you.

1002
01:23:47,958 --> 01:23:48,958
Now then...

1003
01:23:57,292 --> 01:23:58,833
Tell me, salesman...

1004
01:23:59,208 --> 01:24:01,792
where were you in April, 1919?

1005
01:24:02,708 --> 01:24:03,792
I...

1006
01:24:05,708 --> 01:24:08,333
-I was...
-I remember.

1007
01:24:09,417 --> 01:24:10,417
You told me.

1008
01:24:11,208 --> 01:24:14,792
-Working in the factory, on the railway.
-Yes, Sir.

1009
01:24:19,917 --> 01:24:22,333
You want something, Sir?

1010
01:24:27,417 --> 01:24:28,958
They deserved it.

1011
01:24:30,125 --> 01:24:33,417
You can’t rise in rebellion
and expect a medal...

1012
01:24:33,792 --> 01:24:35,417
you got what was coming...

1013
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:37,625
ungrateful!

1014
01:24:37,708 --> 01:24:40,250
-Something bothering you, Sir?
-No.

1015
01:24:41,375 --> 01:24:43,417
Nothing ever bothers me.

1016
01:24:45,125 --> 01:24:48,292
Would you kill a man to save ten?

1017
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:49,750
If I...

1018
01:24:51,208 --> 01:24:53,250
believe it to be true.

1019
01:24:53,792 --> 01:24:55,833
Ten men to save a hundred?

1020
01:24:56,583 --> 01:24:59,125
A thousand, lakhs…

1021
01:25:00,958 --> 01:25:02,333
Depends, Sir.

1022
01:25:02,792 --> 01:25:05,250
So, you agree.

1023
01:25:06,250 --> 01:25:07,250
No.

1024
01:25:07,333 --> 01:25:09,917
You just said it depended
on the circumstances.

1025
01:25:10,083 --> 01:25:11,083
Circumstance...

1026
01:25:12,792 --> 01:25:13,792
yes...

1027
01:25:14,958 --> 01:25:16,875
what one goes through…

1028
01:25:19,042 --> 01:25:20,333
I know about it.

1029
01:25:20,917 --> 01:25:22,458
You know nothing.

1030
01:25:25,458 --> 01:25:27,375
Fear is a deterrent.

1031
01:25:27,792 --> 01:25:29,417
Mutiny was brewing.

1032
01:25:30,708 --> 01:25:33,292
There would have been another
river in the Punjab.

1033
01:25:33,375 --> 01:25:34,458
A sixth river...

1034
01:25:36,042 --> 01:25:37,542
a river of blood.

1035
01:25:37,958 --> 01:25:41,042
1857 all over again.

1036
01:25:42,583 --> 01:25:44,375
Fear was the key...

1037
01:25:47,292 --> 01:25:48,833
and fear worked.

1038
01:25:50,542 --> 01:25:54,917
I ended Gandhi’s soul force with brute
force!

1039
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:56,500
Huh...

1040
01:25:57,208 --> 01:25:58,375
There were women…

1041
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:01,500
children...

1042
01:26:03,875 --> 01:26:05,917
-...wounded.
-Wounded?

1043
01:26:06,417 --> 01:26:08,458
Their relatives carried them away.

1044
01:26:09,208 --> 01:26:10,917
Carry away how, Sir?

1045
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,417
There was curfew.

1046
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:17,958
Martial law…

1047
01:26:19,250 --> 01:26:20,792
shoot at sight orders.

1048
01:26:22,583 --> 01:26:26,000
People were afraid to take
people to the hospital…

1049
01:26:26,083 --> 01:26:27,083
Nonsense.

1050
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,000
Nonsense!

1051
01:26:29,333 --> 01:26:30,958
When he stopped firing...

1052
01:26:31,042 --> 01:26:33,917
that was a sign that it was good for them
to go.

1053
01:26:40,750 --> 01:26:44,500
So, you don’t think it was brutal, Sir?

1054
01:26:46,208 --> 01:26:47,458
It was sufficient.

1055
01:26:49,917 --> 01:26:53,000
He was faced with a seditious mob.

1056
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:55,958
He created fear...

1057
01:26:57,292 --> 01:26:58,958
and it was sufficient.

1058
01:27:06,292 --> 01:27:07,292
Hmm...

1059
01:27:13,250 --> 01:27:16,958
How can someone be so demonic?

1060
01:27:20,542 --> 01:27:23,583
He had absolutely no remorse for what he
did!

1061
01:27:25,083 --> 01:27:26,625
So you left the job?

1062
01:27:27,250 --> 01:27:29,417
Otherwise I would have killed him.

1063
01:27:31,458 --> 01:27:34,292
but that would not have registered as a
protest.

1064
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:38,292
It would be construed as a crime against
an employer

1065
01:27:39,458 --> 01:27:44,375
and that would have tainted the
credibility of all workers.

1066
01:27:47,417 --> 01:27:48,417
And then?

1067
01:27:49,750 --> 01:27:51,833
"Just to update you
on the news from Europe

1068
01:27:51,917 --> 01:27:53,583
if you've just turned on your radios

1069
01:27:53,667 --> 01:27:55,958
Great Britain is now at war with
Germany.

1070
01:27:56,042 --> 01:27:58,542
Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain
announced this fact

1071
01:27:58,625 --> 01:28:01,042
in a broadcast at 6:15 pm New York time,

1072
01:28:01,125 --> 01:28:03,500
6:15 Eastern Standard time.

1073
01:28:03,583 --> 01:28:06,792
In a brief broadcast of about five
minutes' duration which was carried

1074
01:28:06,875 --> 01:28:08,417
over the CBS network,

1075
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:11,167
the Prime Minister said that I have
to tell you...

1076
01:28:11,250 --> 01:28:13,583
we are now at war with Germany."

1077
01:28:13,667 --> 01:28:15,625
"A nationwide blackout has been announced

1078
01:28:15,708 --> 01:28:18,042
with all lights to be
extinguished during air raids.

1079
01:28:18,125 --> 01:28:21,250
The government has issued a call
for up to 2 million young men..."

1080
01:28:21,333 --> 01:28:24,417
Why don’t you finish your flipping
job, idiot!

1081
01:28:25,375 --> 01:28:27,292
I will cut your wages!

1082
01:28:35,750 --> 01:28:37,833
Hey! Stop the work...

1083
01:28:38,583 --> 01:28:40,125
-Stop working!
-Udham.

1084
01:28:40,208 --> 01:28:41,917
Stop it. This is slavery. Stop it…

1085
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,000
Udham!

1086
01:28:43,292 --> 01:28:45,458
The Manager gives us an earful.

1087
01:28:45,625 --> 01:28:48,042
You are scared of him.

1088
01:28:48,125 --> 01:28:49,333
Not me.

1089
01:28:49,417 --> 01:28:51,292
He is scared of the Manager...

1090
01:28:51,375 --> 01:28:52,917
Manager, of the owner...

1091
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,917
and the owner, of the regime.

1092
01:28:55,125 --> 01:28:58,167
And finally the oppressor seated at the
top, rules everyone with fear!

1093
01:28:58,250 --> 01:29:01,500
And they are doing the same back home in
India as well!

1094
01:29:01,583 --> 01:29:03,125
We are humans as well!

1095
01:29:03,292 --> 01:29:05,375
Don't we all deserve to be equal?

1096
01:29:05,708 --> 01:29:09,000
We are treated as slaves!
Disrespected, not valued at all!

1097
01:29:09,083 --> 01:29:11,042
What the hell are you doing?

1098
01:29:12,042 --> 01:29:13,750
-You are disturbing everyone!
-What the hell...

1099
01:29:13,833 --> 01:29:15,375
What the hell are you doing!

1100
01:29:15,458 --> 01:29:18,708
-I will kill you, bloody imperialists!
-What are you doing? Get out!

1101
01:29:18,792 --> 01:29:21,792
You get out of my country!

1102
01:29:22,583 --> 01:29:25,958
Stop being reckless!

1103
01:29:26,083 --> 01:29:28,875
We tried earlier, didn't we fail?

1104
01:29:29,125 --> 01:29:30,708
We did…but we have to act now!

1105
01:29:30,792 --> 01:29:33,333
Else we will remain under British rule
for 100 years more.

1106
01:29:33,417 --> 01:29:34,583
Please leave…

1107
01:29:34,667 --> 01:29:36,375
The world is at war...

1108
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:40,208
we are all under watch, we will resume
after the war

1109
01:29:40,292 --> 01:29:42,333
That will be too late!

1110
01:29:42,625 --> 01:29:45,833
The Britishers are preoccupied with the
war, they are terrified of Hitler...

1111
01:29:45,917 --> 01:29:47,958
...this is the right time to strike.

1112
01:29:48,042 --> 01:29:49,042
But why here?

1113
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:52,375
We have to force them out of India!

1114
01:29:52,458 --> 01:29:53,458
Absolutely right,

1115
01:29:53,542 --> 01:29:56,708
but they think our movement died with
Bhagat Singh.

1116
01:29:56,792 --> 01:29:59,458
We should strike here, right at the heart
of London...

1117
01:29:59,542 --> 01:30:02,417
-our message will travel across
the world -And what do we do?

1118
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:04,750
We drop a bomb?

1119
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,042
We'll do that back home.

1120
01:30:10,708 --> 01:30:14,292
Do you have a gun?

1121
01:30:16,542 --> 01:30:17,917
Please leave, Udham!

1122
01:31:04,208 --> 01:31:06,000
Free speech…

1123
01:31:08,958 --> 01:31:10,708
but I am not free...

1124
01:31:13,375 --> 01:31:14,375
Aye, Sir!

1125
01:31:15,875 --> 01:31:16,875
Sir!

1126
01:31:17,333 --> 01:31:18,333
Wake up!

1127
01:31:24,958 --> 01:31:26,333
Free speech!

1128
01:31:30,625 --> 01:31:31,792
What do I say?

1129
01:31:37,875 --> 01:31:39,583
Aye...drop the bomb!

1130
01:31:39,875 --> 01:31:41,000
No use…

1131
01:31:41,625 --> 01:31:44,583
robbing people of their freedom, is
futile.

1132
01:31:46,625 --> 01:31:48,917
Today, you snatch one man's freedom...

1133
01:31:50,667 --> 01:31:52,833
tomorrow, another will rob yours!

1134
01:31:53,125 --> 01:31:54,250
Futile!

1135

1136
01:31:57,458 --> 01:31:58,708
she would talk about...

1137
01:31:59,042 --> 01:32:01,500
no, not about independence...

1138
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:07,208
about toys…

1139
01:32:09,708 --> 01:32:11,125
just...[Chuckles]

1140
01:32:12,875 --> 01:32:15,000
War is most inhuman!

1141
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:20,917
Nobody wins!

1142
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:22,500
Nobody.

1143
01:32:23,958 --> 01:32:26,167
Only...hatred wins!

1144
01:32:27,042 --> 01:32:28,042
Hmm!

1145
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:30,917
Aye Bhagat...

1146
01:32:32,750 --> 01:32:34,000
Bhagat Singh.

1147
01:32:36,042 --> 01:32:39,917
Ah, my brother!

1148
01:32:42,792 --> 01:32:45,000

No?

In the war that is at our doorstep,

In the last war,

1178
01:37:40,250 --> 01:37:41,958
I filled all the quotas

1179
01:37:42,792 --> 01:37:44,000
for Indian soldiers.

1180
01:37:44,083 --> 01:37:48,542
Over 100,000 Sikhs from my Punjab fought

I made sure that the Indians

No, no, no crime.

for freedom!

Freedom is my birth right and
fighting for freedom is no crime.

say you are a freedom fighter.

Yes!

1270
01:42:06,958 --> 01:42:07,958
I was angry!

1271
01:42:08,292 --> 01:42:10,417
At such apathetic Indians, who stay
content with slavery!

1272
01:42:10,500 --> 01:42:12,083
This man is clearly prone to violence.

1273
01:42:12,167 --> 01:42:14,458
And if given a chance, I shall do it
again.

Have you possessed a weapon
before the one

1275
01:42:16,583 --> 01:42:18,750
you acquired to kill Sir Michael O’Dwyer?

1276

I have before me a written statement...

firearm...

-I'm telling you it was a protest...

01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,000
divided us...

1282
01:42:33,208 --> 01:42:35,583
looted us, robbed us of all dignity...

1283
01:42:35,667 --> 01:42:37,083
-...finished our economy!
-That’s enough!

1284
01:42:37,167 --> 01:42:38,292
Yes, that is enough!

1285
01:42:38,375 --> 01:42:40,333
It's time you leave my country!

1286
01:42:40,500 --> 01:42:41,958
That is enough!

1287
01:42:42,042 --> 01:42:45,167
Will you stop this political ranting!
My Lordship...

1288
01:42:45,250 --> 01:42:47,292
the weapon has been seized

1289
01:42:47,458 --> 01:42:50,125
and he has admitted to the crime.

1290
01:42:50,292 --> 01:42:53,875
-The reason behind what I did was…
-Do not speak in this court...

1291
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,708
-...unless you are asked to!
-But your Lordship

1292
01:42:56,792 --> 01:43:00,000
-he has every right to be heard.
-Overruled!

1293
01:43:00,125 --> 01:43:03,250
We are here to decide on the quantum of
sentence

1294
01:43:03,333 --> 01:43:04,625
based on the crime

1295
01:43:04,708 --> 01:43:06,167
committed by this man.

1296
01:43:07,875 --> 01:43:09,417
Under orders of the court...

1297
01:43:09,542 --> 01:43:12,292
the press would not report on any
statements...

1298
01:43:12,792 --> 01:43:14,000
made by the accused.

1299
01:43:14,125 --> 01:43:17,708
Do you members of the press, understand
this?

1300
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:19,583
Yes.

1301
01:43:19,917 --> 01:43:21,667
I have reached my verdict.

1302
01:43:23,625 --> 01:43:26,083
The accused is found guilty as charged.

1303
01:43:26,292 --> 01:43:29,083
The accused would be hanged till death.

1304
01:43:29,250 --> 01:43:31,542
[Crowd protesting]

1305
01:43:36,833 --> 01:43:39,208
Down with British imperialism!

1306
01:43:39,292 --> 01:43:41,083
Down with British tyranny!

1307
01:43:41,167 --> 01:43:43,500
Long live revolution!

1308
01:43:43,708 --> 01:43:45,625
Long live revolution!

1309
01:43:46,042 --> 01:43:48,000
Long live revolution!

1310
01:43:48,500 --> 01:43:50,542
Long live revolution!

1311
01:44:37,708 --> 01:44:38,708
Sir...

1312
01:44:41,208 --> 01:44:43,500
sorry to report he is refusing all
food, Sir.

1313
01:44:43,583 --> 01:44:45,375
Oh, for God’s sake!

1314
01:44:45,583 --> 01:44:47,292
Don’t make him a martyr!

1315
01:44:50,333 --> 01:44:52,667
-It’s the last thing we need.
-Sir.

1316
01:44:53,917 --> 01:44:56,333
We need to stop this hunger strike.

1317
01:44:59,542 --> 01:45:00,583
Sir.

1318
01:45:23,542 --> 01:45:26,375
[Grunts]

1319
01:45:27,167 --> 01:45:29,792
[Breathes laboriously]

1320
01:45:52,583 --> 01:45:53,917
[Gasps]

1321
01:47:16,125 --> 01:47:18,333
You won’t marry, ever?

1322
01:47:19,333 --> 01:47:20,333
Then?

1323
01:47:26,125 --> 01:47:27,833
Friends forever eh?

1324
01:47:32,875 --> 01:47:33,875
Fine...

1325
01:47:35,458 --> 01:47:36,917
I won't settle down either.

1326
01:48:26,083 --> 01:48:27,417
Ah! [Smiles]

1327
01:48:28,542 --> 01:48:30,875
I have told you everything!

1328
01:48:31,667 --> 01:48:35,875
Nothing more to tell you, Mr. Swain.

1329
01:48:41,250 --> 01:48:43,500
I know you are not a killer.

1330
01:48:44,750 --> 01:48:47,750
You have never killed
anyone before in your life.

1331
01:48:49,458 --> 01:48:51,000
What happened that day?

1332
01:48:53,292 --> 01:48:54,917
What changed you?

1333
01:49:04,875 --> 01:49:08,417
-Repeal the Rowlatt Act!
-Repeal it, repeal it!

1334
01:49:08,583 --> 01:49:11,792
-Repeal the Black Act!
-Repeal it, repeal it!

1335
01:49:19,333 --> 01:49:22,208
-Repeal the Rowlatt Act!
-Repeal it, repeal it!

1336
01:49:55,958 --> 01:49:59,083
Move them back! Charge!

1337
01:49:59,167 --> 01:50:02,500
[Crowd commotion]

1338
01:50:12,875 --> 01:50:15,042
Barricade the entry.

1339
01:50:23,375 --> 01:50:24,708
This entry too.

1340
01:50:31,958 --> 01:50:33,500
Call for more battalions.

1341
01:50:46,083 --> 01:50:47,917
Gandhi has left Delhi for Amritsar.

1342
01:50:49,375 --> 01:50:50,792
Arrest Gandhi.

1343
01:50:50,958 --> 01:50:51,958
Yes, Sir.

1344
01:50:52,458 --> 01:50:55,667
No one should enter Punjab until further
orders.

1345
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:59,708
Arrest all the college students.
Put them in a detention centre.

1346
01:50:59,792 --> 01:51:03,625
Cut all the civilian telephone
lines until further notice.

1347
01:51:04,250 --> 01:51:07,833
The Congress leaders, Satyapal and
Kitchlew,

1348
01:51:07,958 --> 01:51:09,292
keep them in detention.

1349
01:51:09,375 --> 01:51:12,250
Newspapers, destroy tomorrows’ editions.

1350
01:51:12,333 --> 01:51:14,500
No more publication until further orders.

1351
01:51:14,583 --> 01:51:18,833
A protest has been called at Jallianwala
Bagh but it’s likely to be peaceful!

1352
01:51:19,292 --> 01:51:20,375
Likely!

1353
01:51:21,458 --> 01:51:23,417
But it’s going to be political, yes?

1354
01:51:23,708 --> 01:51:24,708
Yes, Sir!

1355
01:51:24,792 --> 01:51:26,750
So, it’s an unlawful gathering, isn’t it?

1356
01:51:27,125 --> 01:51:29,792
-Yes, Sir!
-Who do you have in mind for the job?

1357
01:51:29,875 --> 01:51:32,333
We have briefed Colonel Monago.

1358
01:51:33,208 --> 01:51:34,208
Hmm...

1359
01:51:36,125 --> 01:51:38,208
I find him to be hesitant.

1360
01:51:39,750 --> 01:51:43,417
-Call for General Reginald Dyer.
-Yes, Sir.

1361
01:51:47,292 --> 01:51:48,958
[Military commands]

1362
01:51:51,792 --> 01:51:55,167
This here, the Golbazaar,
JP road burnt down.

1363
01:51:55,958 --> 01:51:58,833
Entire old city area, has witnessed acts

1364
01:51:58,958 --> 01:52:01,417
-of rebellion and rioting.
-How many dead?

1365
01:52:01,583 --> 01:52:03,833
The deaths of five Englishmen
have been confirmed

1366
01:52:03,958 --> 01:52:06,583
and there are further reports
of a political assembly

1367
01:52:06,667 --> 01:52:08,625
near the Golden temple tomorrow.

1368
01:52:09,208 --> 01:52:12,250
Sir, Sir Michael O'Dwyer
is on the line for you.

1369
01:52:13,167 --> 01:52:14,167
Thank you.

1370
01:52:14,917 --> 01:52:17,000
-Prepare the men.
-Yes, Sir.

1371
01:52:22,917 --> 01:52:23,917
Good evening, Sir.

1372
01:52:24,250 --> 01:52:25,458
Good evening, General.

1373
01:52:27,083 --> 01:52:29,625
Amritsar is in the hands of the rebels.

1374
01:52:30,042 --> 01:52:31,958
It is your job to get it back.

1375
01:52:32,292 --> 01:52:35,125
I will need your permission
to proclaim Martial law, Sir.

1376
01:52:35,292 --> 01:52:37,583
You are the man on the ground, General.

1377
01:52:37,833 --> 01:52:39,750
You must act as you deem necessary.

1378
01:52:39,917 --> 01:52:40,958
Thank you, Sir.

1379
01:52:41,208 --> 01:52:43,500
Revolution is a dangerous game!

1380
01:52:43,583 --> 01:52:45,333
We cannot afford another mutiny.

1381
01:52:45,458 --> 01:52:47,958
-Sir!
-I want to set a precedent.

1382
01:52:48,833 --> 01:52:52,750
Punishment of itself is not
necessarily a deterrent.

1383
01:52:53,500 --> 01:52:55,083
But if the punishment is such

1384
01:52:55,167 --> 01:52:57,875
that it creates a fear of punishment

1385
01:52:58,458 --> 01:53:01,292
that would be of great practical value.

1386
01:53:02,083 --> 01:53:04,042
We need to set an example.

1387
01:53:04,542 --> 01:53:06,250
-Sir!
-Goodnight.

1388
01:53:23,542 --> 01:53:25,458
You're back again...

1389
01:53:28,208 --> 01:53:30,167
Almost there...

1390
01:53:42,083 --> 01:53:44,583
Section 144 is imposed.

1391
01:53:44,750 --> 01:53:47,708
Assembly of more than 2 people

1392
01:53:47,792 --> 01:53:49,958
will be shot at.

1393
01:53:50,042 --> 01:53:52,542
Section 144 is imposed.

1394
01:53:52,875 --> 01:53:54,750
Martial law is in force.

1395
01:53:55,125 --> 01:53:58,250
-If more than 2 people are...
-The curfew is on, I am leaving.

1396
01:53:58,333 --> 01:54:00,292
...assembled together, they will
be shot at...

1397
01:54:04,542 --> 01:54:06,167
No, no gathering for me.

1398
01:54:06,292 --> 01:54:07,917
I'm taking the day off.

1399
01:55:15,458 --> 01:55:18,000
No appeal, no argument, no lawyer...

1400
01:55:18,083 --> 01:55:21,667
this Black law will not be accepted by
us.

1401
01:55:22,125 --> 01:55:24,500
We reject the Rowlatt Act!

1402
01:55:30,542 --> 01:55:33,708
The arrest of Dr. Satyapal and Kitchlew
will not go in vain.

1403
01:55:33,792 --> 01:55:35,875
This protest will wage on!

1404
01:55:37,333 --> 01:55:43,000
Until both the leaders are freed...

1405
01:55:45,333 --> 01:55:48,917
and the Rowlatt Act is rolled back.

1406
01:55:50,750 --> 01:55:53,542
Soldiers, take your positions!

1407
01:56:03,750 --> 01:56:06,792
We are not the ones to be scared!

1408
01:56:07,625 --> 01:56:11,292
-Don't be afraid, sit down!
-Should we issue a warning, Sir?

1409
01:56:11,875 --> 01:56:14,083
Remember Shri Guru Govind Singh.

1410
01:56:15,208 --> 01:56:16,750
They’ve had their warning.

1411
01:56:17,375 --> 01:56:18,625
No meetings!

1412
01:56:18,958 --> 01:56:20,333
-Soldiers...
-Listen, sit, sit!

1413
01:56:20,417 --> 01:56:22,333
Take your positions.

1414
01:56:26,958 --> 01:56:29,875

1415
01:56:35,292 --> 01:56:38,333

Fire!

1420
01:59:38,292 --> 01:59:43,458
This incident would have gone unnoticed by
you.

1421
01:59:46,458 --> 01:59:49,500
It is just a footnote in your history.

1422
01:59:52,375 --> 01:59:56,542
Written in fine print in some book.

1423
02:00:00,208 --> 02:00:03,542
But you weren’t even there
when the firing started.

1424
02:00:05,708 --> 02:00:06,792
So why...what...?

1425
02:00:06,917 --> 02:00:09,083
-What did you see?
-I was late.

1426
02:00:13,167 --> 02:00:14,167
Very late.

-[Cries in pain] Ah!
-What...

1431
02:00:29,125 --> 02:00:30,792
What happened?

1432
02:00:31,500 --> 02:00:33,708
They fired at us in the gathering.

1433
02:00:33,875 --> 02:00:37,083
-Ah!
-Parag! Kamal, Parag!

1434

-He's been shot...
-What?

1437
02:00:41,833 --> 02:00:44,083
What happened, Balli?

1438
02:00:44,167 --> 02:00:47,292
-They fired at us. -Quick, hospital from
the back lane.

1439
02:00:47,458 --> 02:00:50,042
-My father was shot.
-Come, come.

1440
02:00:51,125 --> 02:00:54,375
My father is dead! [Cries]

1441
02:00:57,667 --> 02:00:59,750
-Where is Balli?
-Inside.

02:01:03,625 --> 02:01:08,292
When you're parched with thirst

1443
02:01:11,208 --> 02:01:13,375
holding on to your last few breaths,

1444
02:01:16,750 --> 02:01:22,667
how would a drop of water trickle down
your throat?

did I give my youth meaning?

1599
02:24:48,917 --> 02:24:50,833

You must ask for a pardon. You will
live.

It’s time to...

1618
02:28:48,375 --> 02:28:49,833
meet my friend.

-Sir...
-Yes.

1623
02:33:58,708 --> 02:34:01,000
They had defied section 144.

1624
02:34:02,708 --> 02:34:05,500
Martial law and curfew
were already in place.

1625
02:34:07,500 --> 02:34:09,875
Those who were assembled
in Jallianwala Bagh,

1626
02:34:11,042 --> 02:34:12,667
knew they had violated the law.

1627
02:34:12,917 --> 02:34:17,083
And you decided that you
would fire onto the crowd?

1628
02:34:17,583 --> 02:34:18,583
Yes!

1629
02:34:20,083 --> 02:34:23,500
I went with the deliberate
intention of opening fire

1630
02:34:24,333 --> 02:34:26,375
if I found a crowd assembled there.

1631
02:34:26,917 --> 02:34:30,500
Supposing the passage was sufficient
for the armoured cars to go in...

1632
02:34:31,625 --> 02:34:33,625
would you have fired
with the machine guns?

1633
02:34:34,125 --> 02:34:36,125
I think probably, yes!

1634
02:34:36,625 --> 02:34:39,292
And in that case the casualties
would have been much higher?

1635
02:34:40,500 --> 02:34:41,500
Yes!

1636
02:34:42,333 --> 02:34:45,667
If General Dyer had not
dispersed that crowd by force...

1637
02:34:46,958 --> 02:34:50,250
we would have had an
infinitely worse state of rebellion.

1638
02:34:51,458 --> 02:34:55,125
Don’t you think that the
firing went on for too long?

1639
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:57,458
My responsibility...

1640
02:34:58,292 --> 02:34:59,750
was that if I fire,

1641
02:35:00,042 --> 02:35:01,917
I must fire with good effect.

1642
