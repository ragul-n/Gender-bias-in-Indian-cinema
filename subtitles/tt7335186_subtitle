1
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:05,080
Mom, I am not getting sleep.
Please tell me some story?

2
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,580
Ok!

3
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,580
Long long ago there was a big demon in a village.

4
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,790
That demon does a strong penance...

5
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:22,080
and gets the boon from Lord Shiva that who so ever's
head he places his hand should turn to ashes.

6
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:31,080
With that boon he kills all whom he doesn't like and
finally thinks to kill even Lord Siva in the end

7
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:32,790
What happened then, mom?

8
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,750
Then all the sages come and request
Lord Vishnu to rescue,

9
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,080
Lord Vishnu comes in the form of Mohini,

10
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:46,080
makes that demon place his hand
on his own head and turns him to ashes.

11
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,080
What's the name of that demon, mom?

12
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,450
Bhasmasura...!

13
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,250
Moral of this story is that...

14
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:58,870
thoughts of destruction and using the brains into
destruction finally lead to his own destruction.

15
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:04,120
That's why both knowledge and strength
should be used only for the good.

16
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,200
Why are you getting so tensed ?

17
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,410
It's been 24 hours since we got in at Hyderabad.
Look, my wife already called me 12 times

18
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,830
Without informing her I got in saying I am going for office work.
Didn't even get my luggage.

19
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:33,120
Just because it is free trip you shouldn't jump and get in.
There should be a planning for that.

20
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,910
Look at me, I Planned everything three days before.

21
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,700
When I don't have a voice even to oppose her,
How can I get the planning right.

22
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,950
Why to fear every hour... you just die.

23
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:45,750
Otherwise, kill your wife.

24
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,290
You’re talking in this manner reminds me of
our St. Joseph school Arun.

25
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:51,120
Oh no...

26
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,950
Why do you want to remind about him now?

27
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,330
How can you compare me to a guy getting into
ladies hostel just at the age of 14?

28
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:03,370
Dear, are you talking about that Arun
who invented the camera?

29
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,620
Oh Nirmala madam, you?

30
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:06,950
What a way to meet.

31
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,080
Yes, that same guy.
Do you still remember him?

32
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:16,160
You remembered ladies hostel,
and I remembered his Intelligence of inventing the camera.

33
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:19,160
So you might still be remembering
hitting him after removing his shirt.

34
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,370
Even I know Arun, he was my gym mate.

35
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,080
I think I too know that Arun you are talking about.

36
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,620
If he’s the one, he was college topper then.

37
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:29,950
Oh, that guy? He was completely different.

38
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,750
But, he was intelligent.

39
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,790
I think, he did a movie recently, right?

40
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,080
Arun?
- Yeah

41
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,910
He was my boyfriend.

42
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:43,870
Sorry, I’m Sraddha and a model .

43
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:44,540
Hello...

44
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:48,000
In a way, that movie is the reason
for our separation.

45
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:53,000
When he showed the frustration of someone giving
a bad rating towards me, I broke up with him.

46
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,410
Then, I am the reason for your breakup.

47
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,580
I’m the one who wrote that review and gave a zero rating.

48
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,580
I’m Gopala Krishna.

49
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,250
I’m sorry, but that film deserves that rating.

50
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,450
Keeping all this aside, this is strange.

51
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:19,330
A man is known to everyone and
all of them traveling together on the same bus...

52
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:22,870
something is mysterious.

53
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:14,660
In a tourist bus accident in Himachal Pradesh Kullu Valley
21 members travelling from Hyderabad.

54
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:18,250
18 have died, and 3 went missing.

55
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,830
We’re still to get the trace of the driver of this bus.

56
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,410
Where am I, Doctor?

57
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,580
Kullu Valley...

58
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,040
Himachal Pradesh!

59
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,450
Till date I've seen bodies falling into that valley
coming for postmortem.

60
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:41,000
but the first time I'm seeing a man coming for treatment.

61
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:45,450
Our staff going to that accident spot
won’t even carry the first aid box.

62
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,120
That valley has such a history.

63
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:53,950
Not even one is left alive out of the
passengers in the bus, except you.

64
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,160
If you give the details of your relatives, we'll Inform.

65
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:00,660
Ok, thank you Doctor.

66
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,330
You're almost talking after a day.

67
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:08,500
Though you were unconscious,
one of your body part was in active status.

68
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:09,700
How is that possible?

69
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,620
Which part, Doctor?

70
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,330
Your left hand.

71
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:39,330
In a word to say, it's a wonder that you're alive.

72
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,620
It's a miracle.

73
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,790
Wonder! This word is not new to me.

74
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,080
It's born along with me.

75
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,500
Just after a few months of my birth, it seems
I started behaving abnormally and a bit strange.

76
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:01,580
As the Doctor was a close friend of my dad,
he studied my case well and called my parents.

77
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:06,080
If you listen to me peacefully,
you won’t be worried.

78
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:11,120
When in pregnancy, if one fetus is formed then one baby,

79
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,790
two fetus formed then twins
and three then triplet and so on.

80
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,830
So, you just got one kid but two fetus were formed

81
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,700
After a few months of pregnancy,

82
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:34,160
one from the twins wasn’t having
proper nutrition and the other twin absorbed it.

83
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:40,950
Such thing happens in a very few cases and
this is termed as 'Vanishing twin syndrome.'

84
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,660
In this process the survival twin...

85
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:52,040
the baby who lives often takes birth with
two heads or three hands or four legs.

86
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,250
But the luck here is, nothing such happened for this kid.

87
00:07:55,750 --> 00:08:01,830
But neurons pertaining to another
twin are left behind in Vikram’s brain.

88
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,500
Is there any danger, Doctor?

89
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,450
Mahalaxmi madam, it’s not new
for such a things to happen.

90
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:11,790
One out of three with pregnancy has the
chances of getting twins during the fetus stage.

91
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,620
But that to stand is tough.

92
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,250
And now to this survival twin,

93
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:22,500
I mean your kid may get the character to behave strangely.

94
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:31,080
To keep it in a word, you gave birth
to two lives sharing the same body.

95
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:32,870
what doed it mean Doctor?

96
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,000
I'll explain...

97
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:39,790
Since such absorbed neurons
are extended till his left hand,

98
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,200
his left hand gets activated as and when he is too
much excited or into too much of depression.

99
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,410
Because that’s the only way of his expression.

100
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,160
I’m not saying this to frighten you.

101
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,540
Just be careful.

102
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,620
These problems can be solved with proper upbringing.

103
00:08:55,250 --> 00:09:01,080
Like anyone else, he too can feel
the love and touch of a mother.

104
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:09,580
he can remember people
and places by seeing through visual receptors.

105
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,790
But, he can't do everything done by a human body,

106
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,750
but he too can feel all those feelings a human can feel.

107
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,500
The only way for Aditya to express those feelings is that...

108
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,910
Vikram’s left hand.

109
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:30,500
How would be the relation between them, Doctor?

110
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,620
He may either become a useless person because of that...

111
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:41,830
Otherwise, he’ll become an expert in using both
his hands cleverly(Ambidextrous)...SAVYASAACHI

112
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,500
(Blessings...)May all your wishes come true!

113
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,500
(Blessings...)

114
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:28,080
One person means one person
Two persons means two persons...

115
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:34,500
One person means one person
Two persons means two persons...

116
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:41,160
Twins growing in one body, thoughts not mixing in sync

117
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:47,250
Enough for these to be together for one another.

118
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,950
That’s more than enough for mom...

119
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:57,870
Maybe with a pain that he’s got injustice from you,
you are loving the elder and keeping younger away Mahalaxmi.

120
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,870
No problem even if Vikram misunderstands.

121
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:08,450
But I won’t let another mistake
take place knowingly in the issue of Aditya.

122
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:16,200
Why is it that left and right
are not getting along together?

123
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:22,500
Mom’s dream is that you get along like equal halves.

124
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,290
Enough to touch my cheeks with one hand each.

125
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:38,700
My smiles will glow thinking it as a boon.

126
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:44,870
One person means one person
Two persons means two persons...

127
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,160
[What are you doing..?]

128
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,120
[He’s done it all mom!]

129
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:55,250
He is doing....

130
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:57,750
No problem !

131
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:10,500
Laxmana’s path is to walk behind his brother.

132
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:20,290
You’re the wings of my dreams and my eight directions.

133
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:26,370
My happiness is the company of joy for you.

134
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:33,120
All my life should go watching
closeness between you two.

135
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:42,580
Enough for these to be together for one another.

136
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:45,750
That’s more than enough for mom...

137
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:52,160
One person means one person
Two persons means two persons...

138
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:58,950
One person means one person
Two persons means two persons...

139
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:45,660
Keeping aside nuisance of this Aditya,
there’s a world that keeps me happy.

140
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,200
Hi sister.

141
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:52,950
Hey...

142
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:54,540
Sister.

143
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,620
Sister, please don’t cry.

144
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:01,500
I’m back and see nothing happened to me.

145
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:04,700
I’m fine sister, don’t worry
- Vicky, what happened to your hand? Any big wound?

146
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:08,040
Nothing brother in law, just a small sprain
and nothing to worry.

147
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,830
You said it so simple,

148
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:12,700
but it’s been a week since your sister ate
and slept well for the tension you gave.

149
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:16,330
What’s this sister? I’m calling and texting daily, right?

150
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,000
That is called as the worry.

151
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:21,450
If you were in our situation, you’d then understand.

152
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:26,290
I’m sorry sister, it won’t happen so again, Ok?

153
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,790
You didn’t tell any of this to Maha, right?

154
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:32,580
No, but she cried even before knowing
all this as you didn’t come.

155
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,410
Is it? Where’s Maha?

156
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:37,580
As we promised you’ll be back by evening,
she just left to school.

157
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,080
Ok, I’ll go to the school and come.

158
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,200
Wait, freshen up first and then you can go.

159
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,330
Okay.

160
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,910
See Sri, how much my boss helped ?

161
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,500
You always keep scolding him unnecessarily

162
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,410
What help has he done so much now?

163
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,330
As he didn’t give leave then for that tour, we didn’t go

164
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:58,250
Your brother is lucky fellow and hence is alive now.

165
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:02,950
If we’d been for the same tour, Then the news in the
news paper would have been 'Death of a married couple.'

166
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,410
Maha... Sister’s daughter.

167
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:15,290
I prayed to every God that sister
should get a baby girl, after mom died.

168
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:19,410
Because I believed mom will be born again.

169
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,830
She’s born, Mahalaxmi.

170
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:30,160
Hi...

171
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:33,410
I’ll come in the evening and buy.

172
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,410
Okay.

173
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,750
Hey, don’t do cheating.

174
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,250
Hey, I’m winning
- Vikram.

175
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:58,290
Your pampering is crossing limits day by day
and you’re spoiling her.

176
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,660
You asked to send her daily in school
bus and again following till the school.

177
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,700
Why to pay thousands for the school bus
fees again in such situation?

178
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,200
Again why should you follow behind that bus?

179
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,450
Stop it.

180
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:15,000
I’m sending her in bus as she shouldn’t miss her life.

181
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:18,040
I’m going behind the bus not to miss her.

182
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:23,870
Still, will any kid ruined if pampered
or become great when not done?

183
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,450
What do you say Brother in law?

184
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,500
Please leave me.

185
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:33,540
Not all these, she is my daughter
and should listen to me.

186
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,080
I too am saying the same, sister.

187
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:39,370
Your daughter should listen to what you say and
I too should listen to what my mom says, right?

188
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,620
What’s this mother sentiment ?

189
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:46,790
Brother in law I knowingly named
her after mom as Mahalaxmi.

190
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:49,580
But, how does she know to call me as Chinni?

191
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,660
Only my mom used to call me Chinni.

192
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:54,910
We should believe in sentiments.

193
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,200
Sir.

194
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:02,950
Next...

195
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:04,580
Next... Yes, ok

196
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,580
Sakku Eggs... Health in every egg!

197
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:10,790
Say it.

198
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,750
Sakku Eggs... In every...

199
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,950
Hey, Stop it, you changed the
whole meaning with one alphabet.

200
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,660
This is egg and this is a shot.

201
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:19,250
Then...
- Shut up.

202
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:21,250
Do you have any shame? If I give one shot...

203
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:22,540
Why did you touch me, idiot?

204
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,750
Sorry sir, you shouldn’t frighten kids so.

205
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:25,950
You should pamper and say.

206
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,450
See, how cute he is...

207
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,540
Thank you brother.

208
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:33,040
You look like Ramu uncle who takes
my dog for urination.

209
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:35,660
He’s correct only for that.

210
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,120
Ramu uncle!

211
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,750
how do I look like to you..?

212
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:41,000
I remember my fried Robin

213
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,290
Face value should be like this.

214
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,290
Robin means Robinhood, right?

215
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:48,000
No
- Then, who dear?

216
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,750
The dog Ramu uncle takes for urination.

217
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,120
He said you are a dog sir.

218
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,370
Ok, you know director is serious on the sets, right?

219
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:57,000
Enough your laughing.

220
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,910
How can he call you as a Dog Sir?
- I know, come.

221
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:00,160
You said right.

222
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,370
Hey Tenali, are the artists ready?
- Ready Sir

223
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:04,580
Ok, let’s go for take.

224
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:05,540
Action!

225
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,750
We had to sell away two bangles of my mom.

226
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,870
We now depend only on that God.

227
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:18,290
We’re not doing any Gutkha Ad
It's an egg Ad.

228
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
who are these people..?

229
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,950
You only asked for a good family, right Sir?
They are telling the dialogues very nicely..

230
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:28,080
If a guy eating egg with 70 Calories,
6 grams protein, 250 ml Collin,

231
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:32,290
zero carbs, zero sugar, vitamin A to K is like this...

232
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,080
I didn’t understand Sir.

233
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:39,370
Hey Tenali, we’re doing the AD to show
the advantages of eating an egg...

234
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,540
and not about the disadvantages by not eating.

235
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,790
Go and call the heroine
- Ok Sir.

236
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,370
Yes, tell me Vicky.

237
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,580
Take this dialogue and narrate to the heroine.

238
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:56,330
If Sakku is in your house, it’s like Iron existing in body...

239
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:58,790
Isn’t this any rubbish? Is this dialogue enough?

240
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:03,080
This is an Ad dude, immediately going to the point
should be there rather than the information.

241
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,250
You said well Director Sir,

242
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,410
but overall I'm disappointed.

243
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:08,700
Who’s he?

244
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:12,000
That is... he is Mr.Sudarshan,
creative genius for our Ad.

245
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:13,580
Why are you disappointed?

246
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:16,500
When we worked so hard and brought a good heroine,

247
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:19,790
why have you brought such a cheap model?

248
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,330
I’m extremely disappointed.

249
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,500
Hey...
-I’ve got nothing to do.

250
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,910
Sir... Sir... Sir...

251
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,160
Heroine has cheated us Sir.

252
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:26,370
What?

253
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:28,870
It seems she has some cloth store opening.

254
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:32,450
Which idiot has booked the heroine?

255
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:37,000
Here, our creative genius... Egg Sudarshan.

256
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,450
Sir is so happy even when the Ad isn’t completed.

257
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,200
You’re great Sir.
-That isn’t called happy.

258
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,910
that expression is called depression

259
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,040
Still, why don’t you talk as per the situation Tenali?
Do you have any problem?

260
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,250
I mean party...
- Hey...

261
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,910
As you’re giving a party and hence.

262
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,120
What did you mix in this, it is in different taste?

263
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,910
Oh damn, I forgot to mix Vodka for you Sir.

264
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,910
Sorry sir, are you drinking water?
- Have you seen him?

265
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:15,870
Still, our mood is the same wherever we are.
We can’t express any emotion immediately

266
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,750
We hav to control and express when free and at peace.

267
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:24,870
Cool dude, I’m there for you ever forever and after.

268
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,950
But, why do all these happen only for me ?

269
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,200
I’m a good guy right?
-What’s wrong with you dude?

270
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:31,330
You know you are pure gold without him.

271
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,660
What are you writing Sir?

272
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,660
Oh this one?
- Yes

273
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,000
It’s been 15 years since the
concept of hitting with that left hand has started.

274
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,500
He used to give chocolates in childhood
and is now giving money now.

275
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,450
It’s been Two Lakh Fifty thousand till now.

276
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,870
Oh that! I thought you grew so big
and why are you still getting hit?

277
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:50,750
So, it’s working out for you

278
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:52,450
What did you say in flow?
- Sorry Sir

279
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,120
You’ll have it, rascal.
- Sorry Sir

280
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:59,290
Damn! Anyone would won't to imagine so much about life

281
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:03,200
What am I dude, unable to imagine beyond this much?

282
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:05,750
I imagine only this much Sir
- You shut up, Tenali.

283
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,620
You’re over drunk, move.

284
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,500
Hey, see his ego dude
- What sir, how much do I write?

285
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,250
He hit me with right hand
and it doesn’t come into this account.

286
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:17,700
Correct Sir
- Give it here.

287
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:21,080
Hey, what you said is correct and
I’m over drunk. Let’s leave.

288
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,790
Sir, we’ve a meeting tomorrow with the client
and sleep early in the night.

289
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,250
Sir, we’ve a meeting tomorrow with the client
So please sleep early in the night.

290
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:29,410
Move.

291
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:54,000
Go back in the place of welcome? Come on sir, let’s leave

292
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:55,200
Tenali!

293
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,660
Antique shop, selling old items.

294
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,290
Yes Sir.

295
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,910
Wow, interesting.

296
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,830
We can make the concept very interesting.

297
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:29,000
What is there in the concept sir...
look at the client Sir.

298
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,290
She is beautiful.

299
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,450
Hello madam
- Hi.

300
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,040
You said you will come with the director?

301
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,120
Oh yes, he is our director.

302
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:48,580
Hi...

303
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:50,870
Hands are wet.

304
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,290
Hello...

305
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:55,330
Hello...

306
00:23:55,750 --> 00:24:00,830
Tenali told me not to look at the shop
but to see the client who is beautiful.

307
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:01,540
What?

308
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:05,160
I mean, she is sharp
- Yes

309
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,000
Shall we talk about the work?

310
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,410
Yeah sure

311
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,080
Shall we go to some coffee shop and talk?

312
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,120
Thanks.

313
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,580
Keerthi
- Madam.

314
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:18,830
Here, all the details are in this and please go through.

315
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,660
Sir, it appears you are head over heels on her.
Is this love at first sight sir?

316
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,870
Not love at first sight.

317
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,750
Love at six years back sight.

318
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,950
You know one thing?
- No

319
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,950
She even had sight problem those days.

320
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,080
Love story sir?

321
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,700
Huh, college love story!

322
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:47,910
(Hello boss, this life is for love..)

323
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:53,080
(Why ego for a women with man?)

324
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:58,200
(I loved her, but she says no to me.)

325
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:03,080
Wow, enough to get one guy one such guy by
the end of the college life and the life gets settled.

326
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,040
Why a guy like that, marry him only.

327
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,160
Is there a chance, sister?

328
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:07,000
Shut up.

329
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:10,330
You’re taking so much trouble from
a week to escape from ragging

330
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:12,000
and you need Nagarjuna again?

331
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,790
No chance even for Nagachaitanya.

332
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:17,040
Leave that, but you said some of your
cousin is joining today?

333
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,290
Yes, she’d be coming

334
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:21,500
She’s new and if caught by a senior, by chance...

335
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:37,040
It isn’t even two days since you came to college
and you are having cigarettes and also a batch, rascals?

336
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:40,580
Why are you showing frustration
from your house on us madam?

337
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,250
Hey, what are you talking?

338
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:46,330
I’m saying why are you showing all the frustration
which doesn’t work out in your bedroom over us?

339
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:56,370
Respect!

340
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,540
You shouldn’t talk like that so with girls.

341
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,500
Hey, who are you ?
Do you know about my background?

342
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,580
I’m brother of final year Guna.

343
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:06,200
That’s fine but say sorry

344
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:07,620
He’ll not tell.

345
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,080
Did you get it?

346
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,910
Where’re you going?
- To help

347
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,290
You’ll be beaten, move to the class.

348
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,370
You know what you did?

349
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,410
I caught you so that you don't fall.

350
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:59,000
No, you caught and made me fall.

351
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:00,700
Excuse me.

352
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,040
What excuse me after making me fall?

353
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:07,040
Ok, did you catch anyone’s hand before like this?

354
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:08,660
No .

355
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:12,660
Good, I’ll take care that no one else
catches you henceforth.

356
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:13,870
What?

357
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,080
You’ll get to know as the time passes.

358
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,370
Ok, you didn’t say your name

359
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,620
I’m Chitra.

360
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:22,750
I’m Vikram Aditya, nice to meet you.

361
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:24,910
Aditya, pleasure meeting you.

362
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:30,120
Why’s he getting so much excited?

363
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,250
Chitra, you do one thing.

364
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:39,750
I forgot this watch here.
After an hour come to canteen and give me this, ok?

365
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:45,160
What shall I do now? I’m frightened.

366
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,950
Why do you fear so much?

367
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,580
Your cousin is anyways in second year
and she’ll take care.

368
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,330
That’s my courage.

369
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,580
What... my courage? It’s Vikram there

370
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,790
If he’s Vikram, you’re Tulasi Prasad.

371
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:58,330
I showed the same ego in my first year.

372
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:00,370
This is the new style, you get it?

373
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,450
Hey big bang, come here

374
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:04,910
What?

375
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,160
Go and come again?

376
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:08,160
Why?
- Who would say Sir then?

377
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,660
The guy who wants will say.

378
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:14,580
Ok, what is the total square feet of this college?

379
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,500
It would be the same as last year
- See dude.

380
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,660
How much was it last year?

381
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,830
How do I know, I wasn’t here right?

382
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,250
Cool...

383
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:24,160
You go.

384
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:25,500
See you.

385
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,160
Are you have any cold...?

386
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,580
No problem, he left you without saying anything.

387
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,870
That is Tulasi Prasad.

388
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,200
I too felt the same.

389
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:36,040
But he stopped me again this year.

390
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:38,040
Hey stop you Chota Bheem

391
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:39,700
What?

392
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:42,870
She’s still not used to Sir, dude
- She’ll get it now.

393
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,660
Ok, what is the total square feet of this college?

394
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:48,500
I told you naa... it would be the same as last year right?

395
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:51,120
You said it right, ok then how much was it last year?

396
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,290
Ho do I know that...

397
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,790
Sir...

398
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,870
I said it’ll come now, right?

399
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:01,950
Oh wow, is it a Parker pen?

400
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:04,910
Yes Sir, parker
- Lovely...

401
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,660
Give...
- Catch...

402
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:08,790
Go..

403
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,160
Sir, you didn’t give the pen
- Work is with the cap

404
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,870
What happened then?

405
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,250
What happened?

406
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:20,620
He made me measure such a big
College with such a small cap.

407
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:27,160
Did he also ask you even you to measure
the whole college with the watch, madam?

408
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:29,200
He planned a bigger task than that.

409
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:33,450
Hey, stop it now.
- Sir, you forgot your watch.

410
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:36,830
Oh, thanks Chitra

411
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:40,080
Why’s the watch in her hands
instead of it being on your hand?

412
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,790
She said I forgot, right?

413
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,910
He forgot or you robbed it to impress our guy?

414
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:51,120
I know you girls strategies...
- Is it true Chitra?

415
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,950
It must be true bro.

416
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,870
We should never believe such slim girls at all

417
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:00,000
What’s that logic dude?
- Go and ask your grandma, rascal.

418
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,250
Hey, why did she leave so dudes?

419
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,790
They call this self respect in Suryapet.

420
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,000
My grandma used to say one word...
- What is that?

421
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:11,040
We should make the others cry to win a fight
and to win the heart need to stop that crying .

422
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:16,250
Watch given by mom and
I’m in a frustration as it isn’t working for 10 days.

423
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,580
It worked with just her first touch.

424
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:22,080
Sentiment! Your time has started

425
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,870
You know I have a great emotional
connect with this watch.

426
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,620
If you hadn’t brought this back...

427
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,660
Why so much of a melodrama Sir?

428
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:34,370
You’ve given that, right?
- Why did he give?

429
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,330
why did he give?

430
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,700
Huh, why did he give?

431
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:41,830
She’ll get to know as the time passes.

432
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:42,450
Go now

433
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:51,000
Sorr...

434
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:56,870
Huh, this guy is becoming a big villain to my love story.

435
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:57,540
Damn!

436
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:00,750
No idea about love but his support is
surely needed for marriage.

437
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:04,160
Why his support for my marriage? My foot!

438
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:06,250
I mean, you need both the hands to tie the knot, right?

439
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:07,700
It doesn’t look tying with one hand

440
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,410
You know what my grandma used to say...
- Shut up idiot

441
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,580
Did that old lady still not die?

442
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,500
Sir...
- Who is it, idiot?

443
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:16,000
Principal is calling.

444
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:16,750
Me?

445
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,000
Why?

446
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:19,950
Where’s principal room?

447
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,160
Just beside the library Sir.
-Where’s that?

448
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:25,250
Fourth room after taking left and going straight Sir

449
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,410
Thanks.

450
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:29,370
What’s Principal’s name dude?
- Padmanabham.

451
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:31,950
Sir, that’s the name of our peon.

452
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,040
Oh no, is he our peon?

453
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,330
I thought he’s the Principal
since he wishes me daily in the morning.

454
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,500
What sir, called me it seems?

455
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:44,540
There weren’t any big complaints
over your behaviour till date Vikram.

456
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:50,620
But this girl came and complained over
you that you’re following and trying to touch her.

457
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,450
What’s this?

458
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:54,660
Ok till following Sir, but it isn’t me who touched her.

459
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,330
It’s him.

460
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,870
Who’s he in the middle?

461
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:02,120
It means even he is me but I’m not him Sir.

462
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:06,700
Do you understand what you’re talking?

463
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,950
Listen, I’m saying the final word, Vikram

464
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,910
If this repeats again... Debar...

465
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:16,040
Sir, why such a big word?
It won’t repeat again.

466
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:18,330
It won’t... I’m saying it won’t right?
- Sir

467
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:21,120
Saying it will not repeat,
why do you again catch her hand, man?

468
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:31,040
As you may not believe my words, I thought
if I promise and say very strongly you will then believe.

469
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,290
Leave the hand

470
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:34,080
I’ll leave Sir
- Where are you going?

471
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,160
I mean, I will tell her such a way that
she understands and then I will leave her.

472
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,540
Debar if this repeats again

473
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:43,790
Leave my hand.

474
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,250
Leave her, please.

475
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:47,000
Hey, she’s saying right please leave

476
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,620
When I’m telling you, who are you telling to?

477
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:53,700
You can’t understand even if I tell you
and won’t believe even if you understood.

478
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:54,330
Leave it.

479
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:58,080
Hey leave her, I beg you please leave.

480
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:00,250
Yes, he left.

481
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,750
What, do I look like a crazy guy?

482
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:06,620
Yes.

483
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:09,160
Not a lot, but a bit.

484
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,160
Chitra would’ve been slightly confused right?

485
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:22,910
Won’t she be?

486
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,040
You’re reacting to Chitra and even he is reacting.

487
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:26,580
What to do then?

488
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,410
Drop out.

489
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,580
What’s this giving drink and hitting me dude?

490
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,040
That’s the problem, he won’t agree if I drop.

491
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,790
In this matter both of you are totally united.

492
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,450
They call this variety love story in Warangal

493
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:44,330
Is this appreciation from you or from him?

494
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,750
Leaving that aside, give me a good idea dude.

495
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,660
No more beating the bush now,
come straight to the point.

496
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:54,200
I’ll come straight to the point
- Ok, come on.

497
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:59,540
I’m a bit frightened.

498
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:02,500
Fear for you..?
it sounds strange and frustrating.

499
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,830
Ok, I’ll say everything without tension.

500
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,200
Will you come for coffee with me, please?

501
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:11,040
With you? I never expected

502
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:14,660
Not you madam...

503
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:23,830
Sorry
- Why sorry?

504
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:26,790
That isn’t for you, but for her.

505
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:28,450
Then why did you catch me?

506
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:31,540
That isn’t me, but him.
You ask him

507
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,450
Anger...

508
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,410
Misunderstanding...

509
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:48,120
It has hyped your beauty further.

510
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:50,250
Emotion...

511
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:53,830
Anxiety...

512
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:59,450
Has increased the stubbornness in me.

513
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:07,790
Moving clock hand has pricked me in the heart.

514
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:15,080
You’re my last destination now

515
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:30,450
I’ll always be the shadow,
I’m very sorry and have no other way.

516
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:36,040
Why not tell her directly?
- I told her dude.

517
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:37,910
Thank you..!

518
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:40,620
Thank you..?

519
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:04,450
Hey, remove...

520
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:07,950
Don’t touch, take off the hands...

521
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:29,830
How long would you see dude,
won’t you get bored?

522
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,750
This is called as love in any place anywhere in the world.

523
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:36,000
My grandma used to say...
- You and your grandma...

524
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,200
Vikram, Guna batch is teasing
Chitra in the name of ragging.

525
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:40,290
They are behaving very indecently.

526
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:45,120
If he could get luck just by touching you...
Then what if I kiss you?

527
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:48,950
Hey...

528
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,290
What’re you doing guys?

529
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,750
The same what you do, ragging.

530
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,080
What I do is different and this is different.

531
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:58,370
What’s that difference?

532
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:02,500
Don’t you know the difference between
Hero and Rowdy?

533
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:04,450
Oh no, what’s that difference?

534
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:05,450
I’ll tell you.

535
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:09,910
When hero teases heroine, there’s
a chance that heroine may fall for the hero.

536
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,580
But when a rowdy teases heroine,
she will definitely falls for the hero.

537
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,250
No, how’s that?

538
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,120
Like this.

539
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,330
I said right? I won’t let anyone hold this hand again.

540
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,500
Your grandma’s dialogue worked well dude.

541
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:30,750
Like this

542
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:33,540
Move, move to the class.

543
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:37,750
Hello
- What do you need, dude?

544
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:38,790
Revenge.

545
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,870
I have a gang of my range and it needs a revenge.

546
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,660
They never change.

547
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,120
Does anyone have an idea about 'Chikungunya' here?

548
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:49,700
Why not, when that attacks
there’d be heavy body pains for two weeks!

549
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:52,750
If I hit, it stays for two months
and is that required? Leave now.

550
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,290
Why’s he reacting?

551
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:01,330
Dear Swetha, can you give your scarf for two minutes?

552
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:08,790
In general, you create oppurtunities when there’re no chances
and now you’ve got a chance.

553
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:10,500
You’d have bashed it up, right?

554
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:29,540
Wow, chain or a scarf when it falls in their hands
its charisma totally changes, Dude.

555
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:06,910
A kiss or fun is only when the girl likes it.
- Oh no...

556
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,450
It then becomes romance.

557
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:12,330
and if you try to force ...
then It becomes violence.

558
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:13,870
Ok
- Ok?

559
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:18,040
Thank you.

560
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:39,450
I did so many things already, please don’t mind.

561
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:47,500
Don’t notice and ignore, love is blind.

562
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:55,330
Anger is just a part of game.
It’s just a dream till it stops.

563
00:40:55,370 --> 00:41:03,000
Love in you is the same to same even in me.

564
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:14,540
Time doesn’t move when I’m with you...

565
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:22,870
Putting handcuffs to the clock.

566
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:37,250
I’ll stop the time, whatever may happen
to the world around.

567
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,830
What, dream again?

568
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:53,040
He tried to kiss and Principal came by then.

569
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:54,910
What if Principal didn’t come?

570
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,830
You think the guy coming into
your dream isn’t in your heart?

571
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:01,000
Tell me fast, I’m daily dying in my sleep in fear.

572
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:10,200
When I join college I should come class first.

573
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:13,790
and then join a good company and be the best employee.

574
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:15,540
These were my dreams.

575
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:19,660
Dream even now, who will stop you?

576
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:24,750
Suddenly, content in my dreams has changed.

577
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:41,290
Ok, I’ll not delay and say what I feel.

578
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:49,540
Phone from sister
- Yes, please talk.

579
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,330
Sister, is it urgent?

580
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:55,750
Ok, one minute please.

581
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,040
Ok sister, I’m coming

582
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,500
A bit urgent and I’ll just be back, ok?

583
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:20,080
What was that call madam?

584
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:21,450
No idea.

585
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:24,950
I waited that whole day. He didn’t come.

586
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:29,160
That way one day has turned into six years.

587
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,330
After that, I have seen him just now.

588
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:32,700
Will you propose now?

589
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:35,500
Shall we take care of the work?
Go and call them

590
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:41,410
(Chinni...)

591
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,290
(I’ve been waiting for so long for you to return.)

592
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:48,750
(What happened and where did you go Chinni?)

593
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:51,500
Poor Chinni is been into so much trouble Sir

594
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:54,200
You too expected the same reaction, right Sir?

595
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:58,200
Hey Tenali, first switch off that TV
and then your weeping.

596
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:01,200
Sorry sir, I got little bit emotional.

597
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:04,500
My foot emotional!
- Excuse me Sir

598
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:05,750
Madam is calling
- Yeah.

599
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:07,870
Maybe she remembered past.
- Move idiot.

600
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:10,830
Yes Chitra.

601
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,040
Go ahead.

602
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,290
Sorry, took a bit time.

603
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:19,450
Not a bit, but very long...

604
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:20,950
I am sorry.

605
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:22,450
By the way did you read the concept?

606
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:23,450
I heard madam,

607
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:26,120
love story of Chitra and Chinni.

608
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:29,250
Shall we discuss about the concept?
- Yeah sure

609
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:30,620
Okay.

610
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,950
Specialty with our 'V Rewind' is that...

611
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:39,700
replicas of all food, clothes, electronic things, vehicles
available only in 80s and 90s are made the same way

612
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:40,290
Wow.

613
00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:45,790
What we wished in childhood and couldn’t get,
our heart still would be on the same.

614
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:49,080
For example, a lady likes Lady Bird cycle very much.

615
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:52,000
Her wish didn’t get fulfilled
because of financial problems then...

616
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:56,370
Now, she is HR for an MNC and has a big job, big car.

617
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:59,870
But her wish to buy that small cycle is not possible now
since that model isn’t available now.

618
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:03,290
So, we fulfil her wish, like this.

619
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:18,120
Not just this, but type writers,
stitching machines, chocolates etc.,

620
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:18,910
Nice.

621
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,950
So, you give everything now
which they couldn’t have then.

622
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:26,500
Is it only from 80s and 90s or you
also give which are from six years back.

623
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:27,250
Naughty...

624
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:29,830
We’ll look for someone else and you can leave.

625
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,200
Why so much of ego sir? Come on sir, we’ll leave.

626
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:34,700
Tenali...
- Understood Sir, I should be quiet.

627
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:37,830
Let’s start tomorrow at 7 in the morning Chitra.

628
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,790
Let’s rock
- Ok.

629
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:41,830
Bye.

630
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:44,080
Bye Vikram.

631
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:48,660
Bye Chitra.

632
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:50,500
No idea what...

633
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:54,830
Madam, I had a friend named Anusha in childhood.
I miss her a lot.

634
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:55,500
Yes Sir.

635
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:57,950
She is missing just like you.

636
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:06,620
Chitra!

637
00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:10,040
Time has changed but she didn’t change at all.

638
00:46:11,290 --> 00:46:15,540
Anger shown outside,
unshown love and a beauty to be seen.

639
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:21,250
I forgot the distance and pain for
so long in just one look from her, dude

640
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:23,200
Extremely romantic!

641
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:25,000
What’s Sir’s reaction then?

642
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,250
This guy?
- Yes

643
00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:29,330
He reacted well like the audience in the
gallery when Sachin hits a six.

644
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:32,000
Oh no, cheer leading?

645
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:35,160
But what he doesn’t know is that I’m Sachin here

646
00:46:35,370 --> 00:46:39,040
So, sir is just a spectator... Banana in the basket!

647
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,790
Slaps for me even for your satires?

648
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:46,790
Give it here

649
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:50,500
What’s in a slap? It’s routine for you, right?

650
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:52,160
But we should do the Ad very nicely.

651
00:46:58,540 --> 00:46:59,750
How is the frame?

652
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:02,290
Frame is good but the model is waste like his face.

653
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:04,040
Sir...
- Did you like?

654
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:07,700
As I imagined the one I like.... It's okay for me.

655
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:15,160
So, you are...

656
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:18,790
It’s a strange feeling Sir.

657
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,410
And action!

658
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:28,450
In the year 1980, 81, 82, 83, 84,
85, 86, 87, 88, 89 and in 90s...

659
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:35,370
What have come and what went away from our reach.

660
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:39,580
We’re gonna bring them back.

661
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:43,580
Just come and get them back.

662
00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:48,580
Here it is... Here it is...

663
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:56,660
Chitra... Chitra retro...

664
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:07,250
In the year 1980, 81, 82, 83, 84,
85, 86, 87, 88, 89 and in 90s...

665
00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:14,790
What have come and what went away from our reach.

666
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,370
We get this ice cream only in our V Rewind.

667
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:20,120
This ice cream is so good, sister
- So cute.

668
00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:53,500
Have a look into marriage of
mom and dad in VCR.

669
00:48:54,160 --> 00:49:01,870
Go again to grandma’s house
in an Ambassador.

670
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:04,000
Video games not leaving the hands

671
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,910
Hawai slippers and battery lights...

672
00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:09,080
And the bubbles from Boomer bubble gum.

673
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:16,540
Shall we rewind and reboot the heart?

674
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:20,540
Shall we recall the pleasure?

675
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:23,750
We’re gonna bring them back.

676
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:28,040
Just come and get them back.

677
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:30,750
Here it is...
Here it is...

678
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:33,120
Here it is...
Here it is...

679
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:44,120
In the year 1980, 81, 82, 83, 84,
85, 86, 87, 88, 89 and in 90s...

680
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:51,660
In the year 1980, 81, 82, 83, 84,
85, 86, 87, 88, 89 and in 90s...

681
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:03,330
Shot ok... Very good!

682
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:04,290
Pack up!

683
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:12,830
There’s full air already
and why again you want to blow?

684
00:50:13,370 --> 00:50:14,000
Give it here

685
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:19,950
Chitra, after meeting you I’m seeing old Vikram in him.

686
00:50:20,330 --> 00:50:22,200
But I see new Chitra in you.

687
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:24,580
To feel happy now with this meeting...
Vikram didn’t go missing.

688
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:28,790
but he escaped from me.
Not to even tell the reason for escaping Is neglegence.

689
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:30,790
He was in such a situation that he couldn't to talk.

690
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:33,330
You know he didn’t talk for two years even to me,
to a person who is always with him?

691
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,410
He works along with the girls
but he remembers just one girl’s name till date, Chitra

692
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:40,410
What’ll you do if you are in my place?

693
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:43,040
If I’m in your place... I’ll scold

694
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,540
Actually I will hit him hard.

695
00:50:49,870 --> 00:50:51,540
So, it’s a revenge?

696
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:53,870
He deserves it yaar.

697
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,120
Cheers
- Cheers

698
00:50:57,290 --> 00:50:59,910
Ad has come out very superbly,
especially my Samarasimha Reddy getup.

699
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:02,660
It’s not for you to say that... it is Her.

700
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:06,540
Hi...

701
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:08,660
What Chitra, you look so happy?

702
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:10,200
I’ve a good news.

703
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:12,750
Hey, your marriage got fixed, right?

704
00:51:14,290 --> 00:51:15,370
Tenali
- Haa.

705
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:17,830
We should first listen and then say

706
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:19,290
I seriously regretted.

707
00:51:19,370 --> 00:51:20,790
Shut up, you office boy.

708
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,000
You tell Chitra.

709
00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:25,540
Ad we did for our store became super hit.

710
00:51:25,870 --> 00:51:29,500
After seeing the AD An US NRI got impressed
and asked me to open branch in US...

711
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:31,660
He came forward to sponsor that.

712
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,500
Yes
- This really is good news .

713
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:34,410
Cheers.

714
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:37,790
For that, we should go to US
and shoot the same there again.

715
00:51:37,870 --> 00:51:40,830
Same Ad again, damn! I’ll have no kick in remakes.

716
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,950
You don’t take any tension,
It isn’t you doing the Ad this time.

717
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:49,160
This guy?

718
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,040
Yes, Why?

719
00:51:51,370 --> 00:51:53,200
Shouldn’t an assistant director turn director?

720
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:55,410
Won’t you let him become, will you suppress him?

721
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:57,540
Is this your property?
- Huh, all the best.

722
00:51:57,620 --> 00:51:58,950
Go, happy journey.

723
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:00,830
You too are coming with us

724
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:02,870
Why me in between?

725
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:06,410
A debut director needs an assistant director, right?

726
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:10,450
We’ll pay you... lumpsum.
- I see, huh!

727
00:52:25,790 --> 00:52:26,450
Brother in law...

728
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,160
As I’m not in city don’t just get her into
the school bus and get relaxed.

729
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:33,120
You go man, I’ll daily drop and pickup.

730
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:37,080
No idea when he made her eat that ice cream
but is been eating only that from then.

731
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:39,700
Maha, how many times did I say not to eat ice cream?

732
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:41,620
Sister, you’re aware that...

733
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:45,080
when she likes something she will continuously
have for 2 to 3 months and then leaves it.

734
00:52:45,450 --> 00:52:46,950
Please don’t say anything to her.

735
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:49,950
Hey, you don’t support her for everything.

736
00:52:50,790 --> 00:52:52,540
She isn’t listening to me at all because of you.

737
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:53,450
Here, eat

738
00:52:54,790 --> 00:52:55,370
Nice.

739
00:52:56,500 --> 00:53:00,330
Not lik this, I’ll put her in the hostel next week.

740
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:03,250
That hostel warden would peel your skin.

741
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:05,910
My Chinni will peel the skin of that hostel warden

742
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:06,620
That's it.

743
00:53:06,830 --> 00:53:09,750
Ok, it won’t settle so easily.
Your flight time is up, so start now.

744
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:10,290
Okay.

745
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:11,330
See you Maha,

746
00:53:11,950 --> 00:53:13,330
be a good girl.
-Ok?

747
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:14,290
Bye.
- Bye.

748
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:15,750
Bye sister...See you.
- Bye.

749
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:24,160
Keeping the trolley in this angle and...

750
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:25,500
Kittu, come here
- Wait.

751
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:27,120
Hey, come here.

752
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:29,910
Placing the trolley like this and rolling...

753
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:31,080
Hey...
- Sorry.

754
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:32,450
He and his over action

755
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:35,160
Girl in wide and boy close... Boy close and girl wide...

756
00:53:41,290 --> 00:53:42,080
I am Chitra...

757
00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:42,870
Yes.

758
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:44,410
Hey Sattibabu, good guess dude.

759
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:46,330
Shake the hand dear, I’m the producer

760
00:53:46,410 --> 00:53:48,540
I came just for you. Who are the Director?

761
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:49,450
Oh no...

762
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:51,120
I’m the director

763
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:53,540
Then who is he?

764
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:55,160
He’s just assistant.

765
00:53:57,250 --> 00:53:58,160
Hi Sir
- Hi.

766
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,160
class to meet you.

767
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:02,870
I saw your Ad film and you did very well.
I really apology...

768
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:04,160
Apology?

769
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,620
You should say I really appreciate

770
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:08,410
Poor fellow doesn’t know English I think.
I shall handle carefully

771
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:09,000
What did you say?

772
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,620
The same Sir

773
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,120
I said you did great job.

774
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:15,450
That was above average Ad.
He did it under my supervision.

775
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:17,200
Oh not you?
- That’s why I gave him the Credit.

776
00:54:17,830 --> 00:54:19,910
Hey Sattibabu, what you guessed is correct
and he’s the director.

777
00:54:20,370 --> 00:54:21,450
Oh no, anything Sir.

778
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:23,620
Not anything...
You should say nothing Sir

779
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:25,160
Oh, let it be
- Let it be?

780
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:27,450
You are a bit weak in English, right?

781
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:29,250
You’re a bit in Direction right?

782
00:54:29,290 --> 00:54:30,200
How do you feel when said so?

783
00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:31,580
It should’ve hurt him

784
00:54:31,830 --> 00:54:32,450
Ok, move.

785
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:33,910
Hey, you...idiot.

786
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,500
What to say that expression in English Sir?
My friend asked to send it to him.

787
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:39,080
Mindless puppy

788
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:40,080
Why didn’t you send?

789
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,500
There is no internet and will send later.

790
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:42,700
You please come Sir
- He’s correct for you

791
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:44,950
Why did you bring him Sir?
Waste of money for flight ticket

792
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:54,290
Come Sir, come.

793
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:55,200
Wow

794
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:57,750
This one Sir, this is my Mansion House

795
00:54:57,790 --> 00:54:58,580
It’s great.

796
00:54:58,620 --> 00:54:59,870
Mansion house is a liquor, right?

797
00:54:59,950 --> 00:55:02,910
Hey, they named it after this... you dirty rascal.

798
00:55:02,950 --> 00:55:03,750
Hey...

799
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:06,870
Who will bring the luggage if you leave like that?

800
00:55:06,910 --> 00:55:09,660
No Sir, I got message asking you to directly bring.

801
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,790
This isn’t work but their right.

802
00:55:12,870 --> 00:55:14,950
Utilise the chance and get closer.

803
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:18,500
I came so far to get close
- Understood Sir.

804
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:19,500
looks like you are a broker to get them closer.

805
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:21,290
Hey...
- I said Love Guru, that’s it

806
00:55:21,950 --> 00:55:22,500
Hi...

807
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:24,750
Hey dazzling queen, I’m the director...

808
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:27,250
Hi Sweety darling.

809
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:30,200
I’m in rush to go, I’ll see you later.
-Ok, go carefully

810
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:31,540
Hey darling, don’t drink and drive, ok?

811
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:32,950
You’ve a soft heart already.

812
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Hey, who is this babe ?

813
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,080
Hey not babe, she is my wife.

814
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,450
Who is this guy, man?

815
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,790
Wife?
- Yes... Wife

816
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:40,830
How ?

817
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:43,950
You don’t know English, no brains, no courage, no height

818
00:55:44,450 --> 00:55:46,450
and what’s this Mansion house
and that Power house for you?

819
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,450
What exactly do you do?

820
00:55:49,870 --> 00:55:52,200
Five years back... No, I’m getting frustrated
and won’t tell anything to you.

821
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:53,120
I’ll say to you Sir.
- You say

822
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:55,620
I was a cab driver around five to six years back

823
00:55:55,870 --> 00:55:58,540
Suddenly one day, she came across my cab
and raised her hand.

824
00:55:59,250 --> 00:55:59,950
Taxi...

825
00:56:01,370 --> 00:56:02,700
Central Park...

826
00:56:04,870 --> 00:56:06,870
She got frightened seeing me
-Reasonable.

827
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:07,660
After that

828
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:10,290
Same girl came and stopped my cab
coming another day.

829
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:11,910
Taxi...

830
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:17,370
Hi...

831
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:19,500
She got used this time
- Unbelievable.

832
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:20,250
Oh good
- Wait man.

833
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:23,330
That day few black guys suddenly came
and blocked the cab.

834
00:56:23,370 --> 00:56:24,370
Black guys means your guys. Right?

835
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:25,620
Yes, our guys.

836
00:56:25,870 --> 00:56:27,290
They immediately took out their gun Sir.

837
00:56:27,830 --> 00:56:30,330
Give me your money bag.
Give me your bloody money right now.

838
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:31,950
I went and stood blocking that girl.

839
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:36,040
I gave my car keys and my purse
to those guys and that’s all.

840
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:40,870
She immediately was flat for me and
one cab grew to 12 cabs later.

841
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:42,160
I bought this Mansion house.

842
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:44,910
How much cash was in the purse you gave?

843
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:47,620
You saw the cash and that girl saw my heart.

844
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:51,500
What I want to say is, no need of beauty or brains
when there’s sincerity.

845
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:54,290
I see sincerity in your eyes.

846
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:57,950
This girl who has come with anger against you to America
will return back to India in love, keep seeing

847
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:58,910
I’m saying right?

848
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,080
Thanks Sattibabu, you said nicely.

849
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:03,830
You got to direct the Ad film
early in the morning, go and take rest.

850
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:05,700
Hey, who asked you to go? You come back.

851
00:57:05,790 --> 00:57:06,500
I said to him.

852
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:07,160
You go Sir

853
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,080
Ok, I’ll meet you in the morning
- Okay.

854
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:09,000
That way, right?
- Yes, that side Sir .

855
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:09,700
Okay.

856
00:57:10,410 --> 00:57:12,950
Hello, I’m the director for this Ad. Take care

857
00:57:15,830 --> 00:57:17,870
I’m the director for this
- Get out,

858
00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:19,500
I don’t believe you even
if you repeat number of times.

859
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:21,700
Director it seems, huh he and his blind goggles.

860
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:26,040
Hello...

861
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:28,160
Hello...

862
00:57:28,370 --> 00:57:28,830
Hello...

863
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:30,200
Hello...

864
00:57:30,410 --> 00:57:31,910
Oh damn... Move

865
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:34,080
What’s his pose Sir?

866
00:57:34,870 --> 00:57:35,870
What’s on the hand dude?

867
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:38,330
These? I’m directing first time right?

868
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:43,120
I got some blessings from Gandi Mysamma,
Ellamma, Pochamma, Durgamma...

869
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:45,160
You should’ve enquired whether
you get some even in the local church.

870
00:57:45,790 --> 00:57:46,910
That is also here..

871
00:57:46,950 --> 00:57:47,410
See

872
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,700
This isn’t working properly, change new batteries.

873
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:52,000
Press the button beside and it’ll work.

874
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:53,120
He and his over action...

875
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:55,370
This one... If you press this side button it will work.

876
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:56,700
Hello
- Hi

877
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,290
See, if you marry me I’ll get green card
and then we can get a divorce.

878
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:03,040
After that...
- Hey, you...

879
00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:06,000
Assistant director should be like
an assistant can't you knock...

880
00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:07,160
He can't knock.

881
00:58:07,790 --> 00:58:09,580
These typical assistant directors I tell you...

882
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:10,830
But I see a spark in you

883
00:58:10,870 --> 00:58:11,750
Excuse me
- What?

884
00:58:11,790 --> 00:58:12,580
Hey cameraman

885
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:13,410
What are we doing?

886
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:16,200
What are we doing... Oh, yes...
Listen carefully

887
00:58:16,290 --> 00:58:16,750
Please...

888
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:18,540
I’m the director, so read my lips.

889
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:22,790
The girl come from different town,
boy different town.

890
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:24,500
They come here, they want express.

891
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:27,500
The girl says I love you
- that’s the scene, what’s the shot?

892
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:28,450
No shot, no shot.

893
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:30,660
Doesn’t talk like this as it’s a Telugu Ad film.

894
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:33,080
It’s a soulful film and so doesn’t talk like that

895
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:35,250
It’s all love. So they all love each other.

896
00:58:35,330 --> 00:58:36,950
The girl says I love you.
I love you...

897
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,950
That’s the dialogue, what’s the shot?

898
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,160
Why’s he behind me like this?

899
00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:42,160
You all girls go and we’ll talk later.

900
00:58:42,450 --> 00:58:43,410
That’s what?

901
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:46,500
When love loves the love, love loves up. The love...

902
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:48,250
What is the shot?

903
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:49,870
That is what...?

904
00:58:54,450 --> 00:58:57,870
Why is he so furious dude, please take care of him

905
00:58:57,950 --> 00:59:01,120
Hey, you’re the director and I shouldn’t suppress you.

906
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:02,370
You should go somewhere up.

907
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:03,910
This is your property dude.

908
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:06,200
Are the revenges needed at this time dude

909
00:59:06,370 --> 00:59:08,540
You are the director and you manage that guy.

910
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:09,540
Sure..
-Yes.

911
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:14,660
Yes.

912
00:59:16,830 --> 00:59:17,290
Okay.

913
00:59:17,450 --> 00:59:19,120
Ok, you got that?
- Thank you so much man.

914
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,040
Let’s shoot
- Thank you

915
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:21,910
He’s the director
- You’re the cameraman.

916
00:59:25,370 --> 00:59:26,370
Ok, going for take...

917
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:27,660
Action...

918
00:59:31,870 --> 00:59:32,700
Cut...Cut...

919
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:35,080
One more, one more please.

920
00:59:35,330 --> 00:59:38,160
Hey, you’re saying action and cut.

921
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:40,040
But, I’ll say the pack up at least, dude.

922
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:41,410
Hey, say something idiot
- Damn

923
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:45,290
Hey...new director will have that much confusion.

924
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:46,200
What is damn for that?

925
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:47,870
You waste idiot
- Hey

926
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:50,290
How do you say that in English. ? Can you please tell.
I need to send that to my friend.

927
00:59:50,330 --> 00:59:51,660
A bit urgent
- Worthless brute

928
00:59:51,790 --> 00:59:53,870
Ok, there is no internet and will send later

929
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:12,870
Chitra, coffee

930
01:00:18,950 --> 01:00:19,950
I want to tell you one thing...

931
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:23,450
Chitra, please one minute.

932
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:28,200
Chitra, listen to me please.

933
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,910
Chitra, please listen to me.

934
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:36,000
Stop it Vikram.

935
01:00:37,410 --> 01:00:39,080
You said you will just come back and went away.

936
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:42,040
Why you went away? where you went away?

937
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:45,330
whether you were alive or not...
I didn’t know even after trying a lot.

938
01:00:46,950 --> 01:00:50,830
If you leave saying I don't like you
or I can’t bear you... then it's called breakup.

939
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:54,040
We can forget it all weeping for a month or an year.

940
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:57,040
You suddenly left at a time
when I was thinking you are my world.

941
01:00:57,830 --> 01:01:00,500
But you remained the same in my life, Vikram

942
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:04,200
That's why in my Company V Rewind, V is you.

943
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:06,370
I loved you Vikram.

944
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:16,120
Now you suddenly come back after six years
and trying to make me believe again.

945
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:18,330
Am I look like a dumb girl to you?

946
01:01:20,830 --> 01:01:21,950
Sister’s marriage Chitra.

947
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:29,870
Got her married against dad’s will and
then after that believing I’m the reason for dad’s death ...

948
01:01:31,410 --> 01:01:35,830
Few months with that guilt feeling I couldn’t get normal.

949
01:01:37,870 --> 01:01:40,080
I could not think about you at that time Chitra.

950
01:01:41,410 --> 01:01:42,200
I’m sorry.

951
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:52,500
After the situation became normal,
I thought about you.

952
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:55,160
I went to the College...

953
01:01:55,450 --> 01:01:58,040
I asked your friends and they said you were not in touch.

954
01:01:58,410 --> 01:02:02,500
No account in face book, your number got changed
and even your home address was changed.

955
01:02:04,870 --> 01:02:06,370
I thought you changed.

956
01:02:10,290 --> 01:02:12,580
After that I understood when I met you that...

957
01:02:15,950 --> 01:02:17,660
you too didn’t change at all just like me.

958
01:02:21,250 --> 01:02:23,790
It’s wrong to forget you
because of my problems, Chitra.

959
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:28,330
That... That’s because of the situations then

960
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:31,830
but not that I had no love on you.

961
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:51,790
It’s just me in the first letter of V Rewind.

962
01:02:52,830 --> 01:02:58,330
But it’s you everywhere in my company and my life, Chitra

963
01:03:04,950 --> 01:03:06,000
Artihc...

964
01:03:07,290 --> 01:03:08,120
Chitra!

965
01:03:20,290 --> 01:03:26,620
Words hidden, looks that have waited for days
Which way did they go crossing the lines?

966
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:49,410
Words hidden, looks that have waited for days
Which way did they go crossing the lines?

967
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:56,370
In the happiness of knowing you are made for me
and I am made for you...

968
01:03:56,410 --> 01:03:59,750
What is happening to the feelings falling in this happiness?

969
01:04:02,330 --> 01:04:09,250
Let us leave it thinking it is gone
Let us make it happen as it goes?

970
01:04:09,370 --> 01:04:12,700
Shall we rule over the age?

971
01:04:16,410 --> 01:04:19,870
Why not, may be even bitter can become sweeter.

972
01:04:19,910 --> 01:04:23,370
Why not, maybe our pain becomes our pleasure?

973
01:04:23,410 --> 01:04:27,080
Why not, anything is possible now for us.

974
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:37,040
Why not, may be even bitter can become sweeter.

975
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:40,540
Why not, maybe our pain becomes our pleasure?

976
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:44,250
Why not, anything is possible now for us.

977
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:11,870
From the minute I left you
There isn’t a second I forgot you

978
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:18,830
From the date you didn’t meet me
There isn’t a day I didn’t think of you

979
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:28,250
I know the strength of your love
That's why we’ve met again.

980
01:05:28,450 --> 01:05:35,080
Your remembrance in the heart
It’s true that it won’t be erased.

981
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:41,830
Shall we put the distance away?
Shall we let the hopes be in greed?

982
01:05:41,950 --> 01:05:44,950
Shall we ride in fun?

983
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,410
Why not, our closeness makes us forget the world.

984
01:05:52,450 --> 01:05:55,910
Why not, our hug melts down the time

985
01:05:55,950 --> 01:05:59,410
Why not, anything is possible now for us

986
01:06:07,250 --> 01:06:10,080
Why not, may be even bitter can become sweeter.

987
01:06:10,620 --> 01:06:13,370
Why not, maybe our pain becomes our pleasure?

988
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:16,660
Why not, anything is possible now for us

989
01:06:19,370 --> 01:06:21,330
Chitra, I’ll tell you one matter
- tell me.

990
01:06:21,580 --> 01:06:22,500
You shouldn’t get tensed.

991
01:06:23,950 --> 01:06:25,120
I’ve a weakness.

992
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:31,330
When I am angry or in depression,
my left hand will not be in my control.

993
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:36,660
It started when I was born and stay with me till I die.

994
01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:41,250
Vikram, this isn’t a matter for me
to fear or to feel sad about.

995
01:06:41,410 --> 01:06:42,620
But a matter that I should understand.

996
01:06:43,790 --> 01:06:47,200
I had a doubt those days and now I got clarity.

997
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:54,330
Finally you both came together as I said, Sir.

998
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:55,620
I am very happy.

999
01:06:55,870 --> 01:06:58,950
And even our Ad came out superbly.
and I’m opening the store soon.

1000
01:06:59,040 --> 01:06:59,750
Thank you Satti.

1001
01:06:59,790 --> 01:07:00,830
I kiss you guys,

1002
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:01,620
I kiss you.

1003
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:06,160
That is not kiss you guys, Sir
Miss you guys

1004
01:07:07,950 --> 01:07:10,290
I miss you guys, I miss you
- I’ll miss you too Satti.

1005
01:07:10,370 --> 01:07:12,120
And I miss your wife Sir

1006
01:07:12,410 --> 01:07:14,160
Get away rascal, what’re you talking?

1007
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:18,120
We should never try to loot neighbour's wife
and talent of the neighbour

1008
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:21,580
Shall I tell you one thing? People from
my dynasty never would encourage guys like you.

1009
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:22,790
Which dynasty are you from?

1010
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,790
You know what is my name?
- Sattibabu.

1011
01:07:27,330 --> 01:07:28,870
I’m Sattibabu Lavangam

1012
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:29,500
Hey...

1013
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:31,000
Yes, the same

1014
01:07:31,330 --> 01:07:34,750
I’m Sattibabu Lavangam,
son of Suribabu Lavangam

1015
01:07:35,410 --> 01:07:37,620
I’m Lavangam, S. Lavangam

1016
01:07:38,250 --> 01:07:40,500
That is...
- Suribabu Lavangam.

1017
01:07:43,250 --> 01:07:46,450
My Dad is playing with Paris there
and I am shaking US here.

1018
01:07:46,580 --> 01:07:48,580
Satti, why did you not tell this before?

1019
01:07:48,870 --> 01:07:52,160
That means Alda
- Yes, this is my mom.

1020
01:07:52,290 --> 01:07:53,040
Oh, nice.

1021
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:56,830
Then, definitely your wife’s name
would be Dalda, that's why she is soft, smooth and...

1022
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,620
Hey, what are you falling over, you idiot...

1023
01:07:59,830 --> 01:08:00,870
What smooth, you rascal?

1024
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:03,700
Hi Maha, where are you?

1025
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:06,450
I’m just coming out from the school.

1026
01:08:06,620 --> 01:08:08,660
Why didn’t you come today Chinni?

1027
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:10,000
Shoot got delayed by a day.

1028
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:12,830
I’m just getting into the flight
and will be before you in 24 hours.

1029
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:18,200
Chinni, mom is telling that she will join me in the hostel.

1030
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:21,540
Oh that’s it?

1031
01:08:21,660 --> 01:08:24,660
I’ll beat that hostel warden and bring you back, ok?

1032
01:08:24,870 --> 01:08:26,040
That’s my Chinni.

1033
01:08:26,330 --> 01:08:27,540
I love you Chinni

1034
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:58,790
Hey, you crossed.
- Sorry Sir .

1035
01:08:58,830 --> 01:09:00,120
I said 45 right, go back.

1036
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,660
Your Brother in law
and Maha died as the cylinder blasted.

1037
01:09:32,830 --> 01:09:34,410
We joined your sister in the hospital.

1038
01:11:04,910 --> 01:11:05,870
How is she Doctor?

1039
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:07,330
Now, she is out of danger

1040
01:11:07,910 --> 01:11:10,410
But severe head injury...

1041
01:11:10,620 --> 01:11:13,500
Because of the visual seen, her brain is into a shock.

1042
01:11:13,750 --> 01:11:16,830
She can understand everything
but can’t respond well for anything.

1043
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:19,500
She’ll recovery in one week.

1044
01:11:19,830 --> 01:11:20,580
Take care of her.

1045
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:21,660
Okay.

1046
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:31,040
Police formality Sir, we need
your signature on this postmortem report.

1047
01:12:08,410 --> 01:12:12,040
I like V Rewind ice cream very much, Chinni.

1048
01:12:12,370 --> 01:12:13,790
I need a hundred

1049
01:12:14,910 --> 01:12:16,750
What just hundred, this whole shop is yours.

1050
01:12:16,830 --> 01:12:19,160
Eat as many you need. Ok, enjoy

1051
01:12:27,950 --> 01:12:30,450
Vikram, shall we go out?

1052
01:12:32,790 --> 01:12:33,450
Please...

1053
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:40,660
I know that, I can’t bring down your pain
saying something Vikram.

1054
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,500
But I’m frightened to see you so.

1055
01:12:44,450 --> 01:12:45,830
Talk something Vikram

1056
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:50,080
Within 24 hours, how can,
whatever I thought was my life become ashes.

1057
01:12:51,330 --> 01:12:54,040
My future has become past now...

1058
01:12:55,330 --> 01:12:58,290
For me to forget, what I lost is not what I liked Chitra.

1059
01:12:59,290 --> 01:13:00,580
It’s what I can’t get back again.

1060
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,080
This isn’t a pain...

1061
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:06,290
but a punishment

1062
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:07,540
I know Vikram.

1063
01:13:08,370 --> 01:13:11,120
Still, you have to accept the truth and time.

1064
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:22,790
Excuse me, I forgot my phone in the room.
What’s the time now?

1065
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:24,830
It’s there

1066
01:13:35,330 --> 01:13:35,870
Vikram...

1067
01:13:59,620 --> 01:14:00,500
Where are you?

1068
01:14:00,830 --> 01:14:03,250
I’m just coming out from the school.

1069
01:14:17,910 --> 01:14:19,120
Maha is alive Chitra

1070
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:20,330
What?

1071
01:14:20,830 --> 01:14:23,000
Chitra, I spoke with Maha before I got into the flight.

1072
01:14:23,370 --> 01:14:27,330
That is morning 7 'O' clock in New York
which means it is 4:30 PM in the evening here.

1073
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:30,660
As per the death reports, blast took place at 3:45 Pm.

1074
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:34,580
That means, I spoke with Maha half an hour
after the blast took place

1075
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,830
Something went wrong somewhere Chitra.

1076
01:14:36,950 --> 01:14:39,620
I’ll go to the Police station
and you get the reports going to the office, Chitra

1077
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:40,910
Ok, go...
- Ok

1078
01:14:48,290 --> 01:14:49,000
Damn!

1079
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:19,500
Damn!

1080
01:15:24,790 --> 01:15:25,250
Hello...

1081
01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:27,410
A warning to the citizens.

1082
01:15:27,750 --> 01:15:30,830
Due to the cyclone in the Bay of Bengal...

1083
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:35,000
The low pressure crossed the shores
and entered Telugu states as a cyclone.

1084
01:15:35,250 --> 01:15:40,290
So, we request all not to come out from their houses

1085
01:15:40,580 --> 01:15:42,120
Hey, you...
- Chinni

1086
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:44,450
Chinni...

1087
01:15:46,450 --> 01:15:47,450
Chinni...

1088
01:15:50,290 --> 01:15:52,040
Talk to me Chinni...

1089
01:15:53,370 --> 01:15:56,000
Baby Maha, where are you Maha?

1090
01:15:56,250 --> 01:16:00,330
I’m with the warden, uncle. I’m frightened.

1091
01:16:01,250 --> 01:16:03,620
Warden! Which hostel are you in, dear?

1092
01:16:05,410 --> 01:16:07,830
Girl friend, pleasure trip and duets!

1093
01:16:07,910 --> 01:16:12,410
Are you thinking what is this sudden
Storm in your smoothly going life?

1094
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:28,040
Do you understand how it feels when someone snatches
away what we feel is ours and our life?

1095
01:16:29,410 --> 01:16:32,660
Hey, who are you?

1096
01:16:33,830 --> 01:16:34,790
I told you, right?

1097
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:36,830
Storm!

1098
01:16:39,580 --> 01:16:42,910
Still, when there’s a Storm
why did you come out instead of staying at home?

1099
01:16:44,450 --> 01:16:45,200
Wait a minute!

1100
01:16:46,410 --> 01:16:48,000
You’ve no house, right?

1101
01:16:48,660 --> 01:16:51,200
How can it be there, when it is blasted with a bomb?

1102
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:55,200
Sorry man!

1103
01:16:55,950 --> 01:16:57,000
But you know,

1104
01:16:57,450 --> 01:17:02,330
Because of your one day delayed arrival you escaped
and your sister and brother in law got booked...

1105
01:17:04,580 --> 01:17:05,410
So tell me,

1106
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,330
Even after so much has happened...
what’ll you live and do?

1107
01:17:10,540 --> 01:17:11,330
No point!

1108
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:12,790
Vikram!

1109
01:17:14,830 --> 01:17:15,620
Die

1110
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:00,870
Hey, did he die?

1111
01:18:02,950 --> 01:18:03,700
He’s gone.

1112
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:07,750
Nice! Hero!

1113
01:18:08,830 --> 01:18:12,290
You’re still talking means, he’s gone.

1114
01:18:12,450 --> 01:18:14,410
So, I won’t try now to kill you.

1115
01:18:14,660 --> 01:18:18,290
Before I end your story with a full stop,
I want to put few commas.

1116
01:18:18,410 --> 01:18:20,580
The pain which even your death can’t give you,

1117
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:23,870
I’ll give that by taking away the kid
you like a lot, away from you.

1118
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:26,410
Welcome to the new chapter

1119
01:18:26,910 --> 01:18:30,450
(Sanskrit Sloka...)

1120
01:18:38,910 --> 01:18:39,620
Got it...

1121
01:18:41,370 --> 01:18:45,370
Hey, I don’t know the meaning of your talk

1122
01:18:46,370 --> 01:18:49,000
I don’t know the reason for whatever
dreaded thing that happened.

1123
01:18:50,870 --> 01:18:53,620
I will come very soon to take the baby.

1124
01:18:55,950 --> 01:19:00,080
For telling me let the baby is alive,
I’ll give you an unexpected twist.

1125
01:19:02,410 --> 01:19:07,290
I will kill you for taking my family away from me

1126
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:09,040
All the best.

1127
01:19:09,450 --> 01:19:11,000
This is our climax.

1128
01:19:35,540 --> 01:19:36,830
Yes, Tell me.

1129
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:40,120
Sir, actually our house got blasted three days back.

1130
01:19:40,330 --> 01:19:43,250
It is written in this report that my
Brother in law and our baby died in that blast.

1131
01:19:43,450 --> 01:19:46,950
But some guy called and made me speak to our baby.
That means she’s alive

1132
01:19:47,370 --> 01:19:50,120
There’s some problem in your report.
Please check it once Sir

1133
01:19:50,330 --> 01:19:52,000
Hey, what’re you talking?

1134
01:19:52,250 --> 01:19:53,080
What do you mean by wrong report?

1135
01:19:53,370 --> 01:19:55,660
What Maheswara Rao, Is there any problem?

1136
01:19:55,870 --> 01:19:57,540
Nothing Sir, just a small matter.

1137
01:19:57,910 --> 01:19:58,700
Okay.

1138
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:01,000
What small matter Sir?

1139
01:20:01,370 --> 01:20:02,000
Look!

1140
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:03,910
This report is not based on estimation.

1141
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:06,830
But a report given after
5 Government departments examined clearly.

1142
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:11,370
You enquire with DNA, fire departments
and others, check correctly and then come to us.

1143
01:20:11,410 --> 01:20:12,080
Understood?

1144
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:17,870
Yes tell me, what do you want?

1145
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:19,830
Mahalaxmi is my niece.

1146
01:20:23,910 --> 01:20:25,910
Here, you won’t get any information you need.

1147
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:29,080
I haven’t yet asked for any information still Doctor.

1148
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:31,620
I’m saying you won’t get even if you ask.

1149
01:20:31,750 --> 01:20:32,410
Compounder!

1150
01:20:32,580 --> 01:20:34,250
Why are you getting tensed Doctor?

1151
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:37,870
South Asia’s best Doctor award for 2017!

1152
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:43,290
Continuing your father’s legacy.
I came to congratulate you Doctor.

1153
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:46,950
December 16, 1972...

1154
01:20:47,790 --> 01:20:49,290
At 12 in the midnight...

1155
01:20:50,410 --> 01:20:54,700
A goon escaped and knocked Doctor’s
house door with bullet wounds.

1156
01:20:55,700 --> 01:21:03,160
Doctor opened the door, treated him
and then handed over to the Police.

1157
01:21:04,660 --> 01:21:07,700
That great man is your dad, late Kamalakar Dikshit

1158
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:18,250
I came thinking will the son of such
a great man not help me, Doctor.

1159
01:21:19,950 --> 01:21:26,660
What I need is truth and humanity in you
I’ll leave if you say both are not there.

1160
01:21:26,750 --> 01:21:27,700
Wait Vikram.

1161
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:32,580
You reminded dad and made me hate my own self.

1162
01:21:33,450 --> 01:21:36,330
That day, I came home admitting my wife at the hospital.

1163
01:21:37,870 --> 01:21:39,540
Manasa
- Yes, I’m coming.

1164
01:21:39,830 --> 01:21:41,540
Brother, you got a courier.

1165
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:47,540
Sir, is this Doctor Sarath Sir?
- Yes, who is this?

1166
01:21:47,620 --> 01:21:50,660
Hello Sir, my name is Appaaiah and I’m a daily labor.

1167
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:53,200
A lady is suffering here with labor pains Sir.

1168
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:55,290
Take her to a hospital nearby.

1169
01:21:55,330 --> 01:21:56,950
Hospital is far away from here, Sir.

1170
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,620
There is no time to take her into the hospital
It's an emergency.

1171
01:21:59,660 --> 01:22:01,290
I’ve a knife in my hands.

1172
01:22:01,330 --> 01:22:02,700
Shall I cut open and take it out?

1173
01:22:02,830 --> 01:22:04,790
Hey you mad man, who are you?

1174
01:22:04,830 --> 01:22:06,660
Both mom and baby will die if you do so.

1175
01:22:07,450 --> 01:22:10,200
Let it happen sir. Is it my wife or my kid?

1176
01:22:10,250 --> 01:22:13,910
I’m unable to listen to those screams and I’ll cut.

1177
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:16,200
Hey mental, who are you rascal?

1178
01:22:17,790 --> 01:22:22,080
Why are you feeling so much Sir?
Like it’s your wife!

1179
01:22:22,750 --> 01:22:25,910
Better, Iet me ask her once. Wait Sir.

1180
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:29,540
Hey lady, what’s your husband’s name?

1181
01:22:29,830 --> 01:22:30,790
Sarath...

1182
01:22:31,410 --> 01:22:32,620
Sarath...
- Sarath.

1183
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:34,450
Santhi!

1184
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:35,870
Santhi...

1185
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:40,790
Hey, who are you rascal? What do you need?

1186
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,790
What do I need? Good, now let’s get to the point.

1187
01:22:43,830 --> 01:22:44,790
Hey, shut up.

1188
01:22:45,330 --> 01:22:48,450
Sign on the file in your hands without any questions.

1189
01:22:48,620 --> 01:22:51,540
Sign and leave to hospital
and your wife will be in the ward.

1190
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:53,370
Got it?

1191
01:22:56,950 --> 01:22:59,450
What, thinking to call the Police?

1192
01:22:59,750 --> 01:23:02,370
This Appaya called the SI even before yours.

1193
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:14,540
For your family to be safe and for my 10 years old
daughter to reach home safe, you got to sign on that.

1194
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:16,500
This is the only option we have.

1195
01:23:17,870 --> 01:23:20,000
Theirs is my mistake for sure in what has happened.

1196
01:23:21,290 --> 01:23:22,250
But I had no option.

1197
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:24,040
Your wish now.

1198
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:26,250
I am ready to do whatever you ask me to do.

1199
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:30,500
From which number did you and that SI get, Doctor?

1200
01:23:30,790 --> 01:23:31,750
Private number!

1201
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:40,450
Sir, information I asked for...

1202
01:23:40,620 --> 01:23:42,250
I said right, why did you come again?

1203
01:23:42,830 --> 01:23:45,000
Sir, there’s no need to reopen that case.

1204
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:48,080
It's just enough if you tell the name of the
person who has got the DNA report written.

1205
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:51,120
What, are you playing a drama?

1206
01:23:51,910 --> 01:23:54,200
There’s no need for anyone to
tell us for giving our report.

1207
01:23:54,410 --> 01:23:56,160
You can leave now and we have many works.

1208
01:23:56,540 --> 01:23:58,080
What Maheswara Rao, any problem again?

1209
01:23:58,160 --> 01:23:59,700
Sir, that cylinder blast case.

1210
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,500
I’ll take care, send them in.

1211
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:02,950
No problem Sir, I’ll manage.

1212
01:24:04,870 --> 01:24:05,830
Send them.

1213
01:24:06,370 --> 01:24:07,620
Ok Sir. Go in

1214
01:24:13,160 --> 01:24:14,160
What’s the problem?

1215
01:24:14,330 --> 01:24:16,120
Sir, our baby
- Is she gone?

1216
01:24:17,540 --> 01:24:18,000
Vikram!

1217
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:20,250
You don’t look so angrily like that.

1218
01:24:20,790 --> 01:24:23,160
If you say slowly like this, we get doubts like that.

1219
01:24:24,580 --> 01:24:27,000
That is... that DNA Doctor...
- I don’t need about yesterday.

1220
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:28,700
Tell me what’s the start.

1221
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:30,910
That is yesterday...

1222
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:34,410
First I should know about the start,
to talk about yesterday, right?

1223
01:24:35,250 --> 01:24:37,120
Sir, all the case details are in this file.

1224
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:40,450
Baby exists but they say she isn’t there
I spoke over phone Sir.

1225
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:44,910
Do one thing, I have no time to read this file.
You read for me

1226
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:46,750
(Song plying in TV)

1227
01:24:46,790 --> 01:24:53,750
(Shall I float in the pleasures to win over you?)

1228
01:24:54,410 --> 01:24:55,910
Hey, move a side.

1229
01:24:57,620 --> 01:25:00,580
(Oh, in the palace of the lonely lady..)

1230
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:06,830
(Oh, in the shackles of your lusty thoughts...)

1231
01:25:12,660 --> 01:25:17,200
Give your WhatsApp number,
jokes are great and I’ll forward them.

1232
01:25:19,660 --> 01:25:23,160
Sir...even patience will have a limit.

1233
01:25:23,870 --> 01:25:24,500
Is it!

1234
01:25:25,830 --> 01:25:27,250
Even you’ll have some limits.

1235
01:25:27,580 --> 01:25:29,910
Can’t you understand when SI is saying
that the case is closed.

1236
01:25:30,540 --> 01:25:31,200
Work will not be done.

1237
01:25:32,790 --> 01:25:33,540
leave now.

1238
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:36,790
So, you just made time pass not saying till now.

1239
01:25:36,950 --> 01:25:39,370
Yes, I did time pass.

1240
01:25:39,750 --> 01:25:42,950
It’s my habit to play with guys
who repeatedly say the same nonsense.

1241
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:52,580
Sir, I’ve loads of patience and
I’ll keep requesting till the work is done.

1242
01:25:53,330 --> 01:25:55,040
You hit me?
-Any doubt?

1243
01:25:55,250 --> 01:25:57,870
Sir, it’s not me. Please believe me.

1244
01:25:57,910 --> 01:26:00,080
Hey, please no...
- please

1245
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:02,620
Please stop, no please...
-Please stop.

1246
01:26:02,750 --> 01:26:06,250
Sir, I’ve great patience. Please believe me Sir.

1247
01:26:06,290 --> 01:26:07,580
Enough, he’ll die... stop it.

1248
01:26:07,620 --> 01:26:10,410
I’ve great patience, please believe me
-Please leave him...

1249
01:26:10,450 --> 01:26:13,040
Leave me guys...
-Enough, he’ll die..please stop.

1250
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:16,700
It’s not me, believe me Sir. I’ve great patience.

1251
01:26:16,750 --> 01:26:18,580
How do you say, you have lot of patience, man?

1252
01:26:28,410 --> 01:26:30,450
I don't understand what’s happening, sister.

1253
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:33,540
I’ve become all alone.

1254
01:26:36,330 --> 01:26:40,540
He has no relation to my feelings
and that's why I have come to a decision.

1255
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:46,830
Why this special effect only to me, Doctor?

1256
01:26:50,250 --> 01:26:53,950
I'll survive with a single hand,
but can't bear his torture.

1257
01:26:54,910 --> 01:26:57,660
Vikram, after all that’s your brother.

1258
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:03,870
Brother is a body guard who comes without asking for.

1259
01:27:05,660 --> 01:27:07,370
I’ve been treating you from your childhood.

1260
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:13,000
In a way, I know better than you about
yourself and your hand.

1261
01:27:14,500 --> 01:27:19,500
What you don’t know is that... I gave a solution to this
problem to your parents 20 years back itself.

1262
01:27:23,410 --> 01:27:28,450
That means, you’ll completely remove
those neurons from Vikram’s left hand.

1263
01:27:28,750 --> 01:27:29,290
Yes.

1264
01:27:30,660 --> 01:27:33,950
So, Aditya won’t be there now in Vikram Aditya.

1265
01:27:36,580 --> 01:27:41,830
Doctor, I’m the reason for him to get into that situation.

1266
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:46,160
You said that all this has happened
because of malnutrition.

1267
01:27:46,700 --> 01:27:47,120
Yes.

1268
01:27:47,830 --> 01:27:50,750
That in a way knowingly or unknowingly my mistake.

1269
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:56,870
If I had taken proper care,
I’d have had two kids today.

1270
01:27:58,120 --> 01:28:01,000
But still, I have two kids Doctor.

1271
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:07,250
But, I’m seeing both my kids in just one.

1272
01:28:08,370 --> 01:28:12,000
I’m seeing my elder son in the
left hand of my younger son.

1273
01:28:14,830 --> 01:28:16,250
If he is Vikram...

1274
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:18,500
He’s my cute Bhetaludu (Devil).

1275
01:28:21,450 --> 01:28:22,290
Bhetaludu!

1276
01:28:22,910 --> 01:28:24,620
She said this correctly Doctor.

1277
01:28:27,370 --> 01:28:31,000
It was mother’s wish and thus
will never let even that thought come up.

1278
01:28:36,250 --> 01:28:38,790
Sir, we’ll get to know that
private number in the next five minutes.

1279
01:28:38,870 --> 01:28:39,790
How much more long, dude?

1280
01:28:39,830 --> 01:28:42,000
Your life would be known in the next six minutes.

1281
01:28:42,540 --> 01:28:43,620
Sir, don’t frighten me Sir.

1282
01:28:43,830 --> 01:28:47,080
Ordinary number is fine but this is
private number and tough to trace.

1283
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:51,120
It’s like giving all
lame excuses when you cannot do it.

1284
01:28:51,870 --> 01:28:52,950
What are you talking Sir?

1285
01:28:53,910 --> 01:28:55,000
My friend is calling Sir.

1286
01:28:55,910 --> 01:28:57,120
Hello... tell me dude...

1287
01:28:58,040 --> 01:29:04,660
7842986878

1288
01:29:06,330 --> 01:29:07,660
Vikram, this is your number.

1289
01:29:10,790 --> 01:29:12,540
How can calls go to them from your number?

1290
01:29:13,330 --> 01:29:15,250
How would calls come from your number
to your own number?

1291
01:29:15,660 --> 01:29:16,750
How’s this possible?

1292
01:29:19,450 --> 01:29:20,410
It’s possible.

1293
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:23,870
It can be done with SIM cloning and number masking.

1294
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:26,910
Intelligent Idiot.

1295
01:29:31,330 --> 01:29:32,870
Sir, some courier has come.

1296
01:29:33,830 --> 01:29:35,700
This looks like some postmortem report.

1297
01:29:39,700 --> 01:29:41,080
Oh... Damn!

1298
01:29:47,250 --> 01:29:48,370
Whose is that Vikram?

1299
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:51,450
It’s of the DNA Doctor who gave us information.

1300
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:53,620
He’s killed him.

1301
01:30:00,250 --> 01:30:00,790
Hello...

1302
01:30:00,950 --> 01:30:03,700
(Sanskrit sloka...)

1303
01:30:05,830 --> 01:30:09,040
Emotion of the baby should just be only in between us.

1304
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:15,250
The same repeats if you deny and enquire from anyone.

1305
01:30:15,870 --> 01:30:18,370
If you want, you can try anyone from your circle.

1306
01:30:19,290 --> 01:30:19,870
Ready?

1307
01:30:21,290 --> 01:30:22,250
Ready?

1308
01:30:22,830 --> 01:30:23,910
No... No...

1309
01:30:25,250 --> 01:30:25,870
Good.

1310
01:30:26,290 --> 01:30:27,000
Good boy.

1311
01:30:27,410 --> 01:30:30,250
Leaving that, I’m unable to resist from appreciating you.

1312
01:30:30,700 --> 01:30:32,750
You’re super and you’re a level.

1313
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:36,120
But I’m your next level.

1314
01:30:36,620 --> 01:30:39,160
You may have the capacity to trace out the private number.

1315
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:43,410
I can hijack anyone’s number
and that’s my range.

1316
01:30:45,370 --> 01:30:47,120
No, I don’t want
- Eat a bit dear.

1317
01:30:48,700 --> 01:30:50,620
You want to listen to the Maha voice?

1318
01:30:52,580 --> 01:30:54,450
Yes, yes please... Please

1319
01:30:56,750 --> 01:31:00,250
It isn’t enough to speak angrily and
throw challenges in the first phone call itself.

1320
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:03,370
You should increase your capacity to reach me.

1321
01:31:04,580 --> 01:31:06,080
Wait for my call tomorrow.

1322
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:10,660
The game is on...

1323
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:16,200
Nanda Kishore!

1324
01:31:22,790 --> 01:31:25,580
He would’ve lost his mind with the shock.

1325
01:31:27,370 --> 01:31:28,700
What do you say Nanda Kishore?

1326
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:35,000
In my opinion... it isn’t a big deal for the present generation
to hijack a number with the available technology Sir.

1327
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:37,250
We’ve been seeing both in the paper and net, right?

1328
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:38,870
So, you say it isn’t a big deal.

1329
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:41,080
My opinion is, it isn’t big Sir

1330
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:55,620
Praising is what makes any wizard into a fool.

1331
01:31:56,620 --> 01:31:59,410
You don’t know that and I don’t like that.

1332
01:32:00,700 --> 01:32:02,160
Deepavali offer is on, right?

1333
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:06,250
Buy a good silk sari for your wife in Chandana Brothers.

1334
01:32:06,750 --> 01:32:07,500
No Sir.

1335
01:32:07,790 --> 01:32:09,250
This isn’t a gift Nanda Kishore.

1336
01:32:10,160 --> 01:32:13,040
It is what you earned for your loyalty.

1337
01:32:13,450 --> 01:32:14,450
Come on, take it.

1338
01:32:17,160 --> 01:32:17,830
Thank you Sir.

1339
01:32:19,750 --> 01:32:20,290
Sister...

1340
01:32:21,700 --> 01:32:24,910
I don't know where is the baby? with whom she is?
Why she is there?

1341
01:32:25,950 --> 01:32:30,790
I’m not knowing anything else
than to do what he’s saying.

1342
01:32:31,410 --> 01:32:37,700
But I know that you’ll soon feed her
with these hands, sister.

1343
01:32:47,290 --> 01:32:47,700
Hello...

1344
01:32:47,750 --> 01:32:55,080
(How is this bonding in between you and me, my stranger...)
(Song Humming.)

1345
01:32:56,120 --> 01:32:58,370
What, not knowing where to start?

1346
01:32:58,540 --> 01:33:00,040
Don’t worry Chinni.

1347
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:03,120
I’ll help you for that, ok.

1348
01:33:03,450 --> 01:33:06,370
If you come to the location I tell, you can meet me.

1349
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:09,870
Start my boy, location message
I sent to your phone is delivered.

1350
01:33:13,330 --> 01:33:16,660
(Background Song..)

1351
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:38,410
(How is this bonding in between you and me, my stranger...)
(Song playing in radio.)

1352
01:33:39,540 --> 01:33:40,620
Tell me, what do you need?

1353
01:33:41,910 --> 01:33:44,160
Tell that you want Khubani ka Meetha.

1354
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:46,040
Khubani ka Meetha

1355
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:47,500
Give Meetha and take Khubani.

1356
01:33:48,870 --> 01:33:50,540
Ask for his bank account number.

1357
01:33:50,830 --> 01:33:52,290
What is your account number?

1358
01:33:52,290 --> 01:33:57,160
3020408007

1359
01:33:57,410 --> 01:33:58,370
Allahabad Bank.

1360
01:33:58,790 --> 01:34:00,000
Allahabad Bank.

1361
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,790
Oh, money has come? You’re so fast Sir.

1362
01:34:08,250 --> 01:34:09,450
My account...?

1363
01:34:09,750 --> 01:34:13,500
Don’t be surprised Chinni.
I’ve all your details on my finger tips.

1364
01:34:13,830 --> 01:34:16,250
Are your bank IDs and passwords something tough?

1365
01:34:16,450 --> 01:34:19,370
Take the bag he gives now
and start to the next location.

1366
01:34:25,910 --> 01:34:30,410
I'll come crossing the troubles
and the directions. What else now?

1367
01:34:34,660 --> 01:34:36,080
your doing what I am telling you....

1368
01:34:36,250 --> 01:34:38,450
You’re entertaining me a lot, thank you.

1369
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:40,450
I wish to give you something.

1370
01:34:42,660 --> 01:34:46,370
There’s a damaged red car exactly on the corner.

1371
01:34:47,370 --> 01:34:49,080
There is a gunny bag just beside that.

1372
01:34:50,120 --> 01:34:50,540
Go.

1373
01:34:51,080 --> 01:34:51,910
Go and take.

1374
01:35:07,120 --> 01:35:08,080
Oh damn!

1375
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:09,040
Oh God!

1376
01:35:09,700 --> 01:35:10,660
Dear... are you okay?

1377
01:35:10,870 --> 01:35:12,870
Dear... Oh damn!

1378
01:35:16,750 --> 01:35:18,500
You got frightened thinking that’s Maha.

1379
01:35:19,790 --> 01:35:23,160
You got relaxed knowing it isn’t her.

1380
01:35:23,950 --> 01:35:26,620
But feeling sad that he’s a small kid.

1381
01:35:27,080 --> 01:35:29,200
Hey, are you a human or an animal?

1382
01:35:29,330 --> 01:35:32,040
Don’t compare me with animal
and don't spoil the animal's reputation.

1383
01:35:34,370 --> 01:35:37,120
I’m a demon in the human form.

1384
01:35:45,950 --> 01:35:49,950
If he’s taken to hospital,
he’ll open his eyes and see the world.

1385
01:35:50,250 --> 01:35:54,160
And if you come to the Railway station, you’ll see me.

1386
01:35:54,910 --> 01:35:57,950
Will you see me or save that fellow?

1387
01:35:58,200 --> 01:35:59,660
Choice is yours.

1388
01:35:59,790 --> 01:36:00,750
cheers!

1389
01:36:01,330 --> 01:36:08,040
(Background Song...)

1390
01:36:42,580 --> 01:36:43,830
Hey, hey stop.

1391
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:49,160
Hey you, stop...

1392
01:36:53,910 --> 01:36:54,450
Stop...

1393
01:36:57,580 --> 01:36:58,540
Hey stop...

1394
01:36:58,910 --> 01:37:00,000
Hey..
-Hey, wait.

1395
01:37:00,500 --> 01:37:02,580
He’s my man... leave him.

1396
01:37:07,620 --> 01:37:11,950
What you do now is, the train you should
get in is on the platform number six, go.

1397
01:37:12,450 --> 01:37:15,200
It comes to the next station in the next 10 minutes.

1398
01:37:15,330 --> 01:37:17,410
Understood, I’ll be meeting you there.

1399
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:19,330
Run, run, run!

1400
01:37:50,700 --> 01:37:52,580
Announcement to the passengers!

1401
01:37:52,910 --> 01:38:01,040
Train to travel from Lingampalli to Secunderabad
station will start 30 minutes late from the platform no. 6.

1402
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:04,080
Tring... Tring...

1403
01:38:04,250 --> 01:38:08,000
I’ve nothing to do with that train timing and my timing.

1404
01:38:08,620 --> 01:38:11,750
Time for you to reach me is 10 minutes.

1405
01:38:12,120 --> 01:38:15,200
and 9 minutes if you take shortcut
from outside the station.

1406
01:38:15,910 --> 01:38:20,620
I’ll wait for just 9 minutes for you, come on my boy.

1407
01:38:30,250 --> 01:38:35,330
Hello by the way, the timeline I said is
for the guy whose awake and not for the one in trance.

1408
01:38:35,660 --> 01:38:37,910
What, you think I’m talking without any meaning?

1409
01:38:38,200 --> 01:38:42,950
The water you just had will make
you sleep in the next 30 seconds.

1410
01:38:43,450 --> 01:38:49,500
I forgot to say, baby’s passport
I got made is in the bag you just got.

1411
01:38:49,660 --> 01:38:52,000
You can never meet the girl now.

1412
01:38:53,120 --> 01:38:54,830
What are you going to do?

1413
01:38:56,080 --> 01:38:57,580
Chinni...

1414
01:39:14,830 --> 01:39:18,160
One after one and one by one...

1415
01:39:21,290 --> 01:39:22,540
Nanda Kishore
- Sir.

1416
01:39:23,500 --> 01:39:24,750
Start the vehicle
- Ok Sir.

1417
01:39:27,750 --> 01:39:31,080
One after one and one by one...

1418
01:39:33,750 --> 01:39:38,160
I'll come breaking the barricades
What else now?

1419
01:39:56,580 --> 01:40:00,410
His is the commitment Nanda Kishore, he came till there.

1420
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:02,120
You think he’d come till me

1421
01:40:03,040 --> 01:40:04,160
You won’t let him come, right Sir?

1422
01:40:04,410 --> 01:40:05,200
Hey shut up.

1423
01:40:05,580 --> 01:40:08,660
Be quiet Nanda Kishore. Am I such a bad guy?

1424
01:40:09,790 --> 01:40:12,000
See now, how I would motivate him?

1425
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:15,120
Get up Vikram,

1426
01:40:15,540 --> 01:40:17,910
tiredness is just for the body and not for the Brain.

1427
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:20,580
Tell the brain that nothing can stop it.

1428
01:40:21,160 --> 01:40:22,250
Believe in yourself!

1429
01:40:22,790 --> 01:40:25,620
Hey, Maha wants to see you Vikram.

1430
01:40:26,750 --> 01:40:29,040
Can’t you take just 10 more steps for the Maha?

1431
01:40:46,870 --> 01:40:48,000
Oh man!

1432
01:40:48,950 --> 01:40:50,120
What’s this Nanda Kishore?

1433
01:40:50,500 --> 01:40:52,290
He fell down like that even after I motivated so much.

1434
01:40:52,500 --> 01:40:54,200
You gave sedation and are asking him to do a marathon,

1435
01:40:55,290 --> 01:40:56,250
Great man!

1436
01:40:58,540 --> 01:41:02,000
Looking at him, doesn't he resembles
Abhimanyu from Padmavyuha, right?

1437
01:41:02,450 --> 01:41:03,830
I agree yours is 'Padmavyuha', Sir.

1438
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,580
but he looks more like Arjuna than Abhimanyu

1439
01:41:08,370 --> 01:41:12,500
If Arjun, I’m in the places where he roamed around
and let’s see if he can find out.

1440
01:41:14,370 --> 01:41:15,700
Start the car
- Ok Sir.

1441
01:41:33,410 --> 01:41:35,030
What are these bruises..?

1442
01:41:35,200 --> 01:41:38,450
I got hurt when I hit Guna for you yesterday.

1443
01:41:38,580 --> 01:41:40,830
Why did you react so violently?

1444
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,750
Whole college understood but not you.

1445
01:41:44,540 --> 01:41:48,290
Hey, enough of the time pass done,
but practice the dialogues for the drama we're going to perform.

1446
01:41:48,410 --> 01:41:50,250
There are already too many expectations
- Ok dude

1447
01:41:52,540 --> 01:41:53,620
Hi everybody...

1448
01:41:53,870 --> 01:41:57,790
Today in our college
'Subadhra Parinayam' drama will be presented.

1449
01:41:58,080 --> 01:41:59,790
Kittu as Krishna.

1450
01:42:00,120 --> 01:42:02,040
May all people be blessed...

1451
01:42:02,700 --> 01:42:04,700
Vikram as Arjun.

1452
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:07,080
What’s up?

1453
01:42:07,370 --> 01:42:10,330
Mind your body language, a bit, Arjun.

1454
01:42:11,120 --> 01:42:12,080
What’s up?

1455
01:42:12,120 --> 01:42:13,290
Even the language.

1456
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:15,040
Ok brother...

1457
01:42:15,080 --> 01:42:16,370
Not brother but Brother in law.

1458
01:42:16,410 --> 01:42:19,660
If the relation ship changed,
they will pierce you with you your own arrow.

1459
01:42:19,950 --> 01:42:21,830
Bosu as Dharamaraj.

1460
01:42:22,370 --> 01:42:24,790
Krishna, was even Dharmaraj handsome like me?

1461
01:42:24,910 --> 01:42:27,040
Should he be like you or handsome?

1462
01:42:29,950 --> 01:42:32,700
Padmanabham as Balaram.

1463
01:42:32,910 --> 01:42:34,950
Ornaments itself are heavy and
they gave this plough again.

1464
01:42:35,290 --> 01:42:37,200
Junior Harsha as Duryodhan.

1465
01:42:37,290 --> 01:42:40,500
Wait, wait master, what did you say?
What did you say?

1466
01:42:40,700 --> 01:42:46,500
Wait, wait Duryodhana, none has said anything yet
and there’s still time for the drama to begin.

1467
01:42:46,790 --> 01:42:48,870
Monty as Dushasan.

1468
01:42:50,160 --> 01:42:52,080
Brother, shall I pull the sari?

1469
01:42:52,500 --> 01:42:55,160
This isn’t the play of pulling the sari Dushasana...

1470
01:42:55,200 --> 01:42:55,750
What Then?

1471
01:42:55,790 --> 01:42:57,540
Looks like brothers aren’t going to wait for anything.

1472
01:42:57,700 --> 01:42:59,830
This is the marriage of my sister Subhadra.

1473
01:43:00,250 --> 01:43:01,250
Not that one it seems

1474
01:43:01,410 --> 01:43:03,080
Isn’t parinayam that?
- No, it seems

1475
01:43:07,950 --> 01:43:09,910
Shall we stop the nuisance now and start the drama?

1476
01:43:10,200 --> 01:43:12,040
I salute to the feet of Balaram.

1477
01:43:12,700 --> 01:43:14,330
My Gadha(weapon) salutes to Balaram.

1478
01:43:14,370 --> 01:43:18,290
Why waiting, you too say flute and fan salutes

1479
01:43:18,330 --> 01:43:21,000
Wait, wait master, what did you say?
what did you say?

1480
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:23,450
Should I take out the slippers and...
-Please, I thought I may forget that dialogue and hence...

1481
01:43:23,500 --> 01:43:26,540
Forget it! That dialogue isn’t there in this drama.

1482
01:43:27,790 --> 01:43:29,750
Let the discussions with the maids be later...

1483
01:43:30,120 --> 01:43:31,750
There will be total three rounds in this.

1484
01:43:31,830 --> 01:43:34,790
Oh no Balram bro, I get dizzy just for two rounds only.

1485
01:43:34,830 --> 01:43:38,910
These are not those rounds dear,
I mean there will be three tests.

1486
01:43:39,200 --> 01:43:43,120
Hey, I gave my name for the drama as I couldn’t write the exams
and why do you say exams again?

1487
01:43:43,160 --> 01:43:45,660
Why not listen first Dharmaraj?
-What to listen?

1488
01:43:45,700 --> 01:43:47,660
You know what Sri Krishna said in Bhagawadgita?

1489
01:43:47,750 --> 01:43:49,370
Oh no, why did you hit me?

1490
01:43:49,450 --> 01:43:50,200
Who am I?

1491
01:43:50,540 --> 01:43:51,370
Lord Sri Krishna.

1492
01:43:51,410 --> 01:43:52,790
So, you want to tell me back what I only said?

1493
01:43:53,500 --> 01:43:54,450
Yes, right?

1494
01:43:54,500 --> 01:43:58,250
You tell Driver Ramudu sir
- Not Driver Ramudu but Balramudu.

1495
01:43:58,410 --> 01:44:02,290
My preparation is ruining because
of this fool, please you tell Mr. Balaramudu.

1496
01:44:02,580 --> 01:44:03,540
Look Arjuna...

1497
01:44:03,700 --> 01:44:06,580
Leave all this, but say what if I win three tests?

1498
01:44:07,620 --> 01:44:09,080
You can marry Subhadra.

1499
01:44:09,750 --> 01:44:10,750
What if one looses?

1500
01:44:11,040 --> 01:44:12,330
You can marry the maid.

1501
01:44:15,660 --> 01:44:18,080
To start with test your strengths.

1502
01:44:22,160 --> 01:44:24,370
Om...

1503
01:44:24,580 --> 01:44:26,580
Duryodhan, what’re you doing?

1504
01:44:26,910 --> 01:44:31,580
He’ll definitely turn his arrow into a snake
and thus I want to change my weapon into an eagle.

1505
01:44:31,660 --> 01:44:33,200
How many backlogs do you have in 1st year?
- Five, five.

1506
01:44:33,580 --> 01:44:36,250
Look into that first and you can
then turn the weapon into eagle.

1507
01:44:36,500 --> 01:44:37,910
Still, what brother said is correct.

1508
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:41,000
You and your brother will be pierced one inch.
-Hey, what is that?

1509
01:44:41,080 --> 01:44:42,540
With the weapon
- You move

1510
01:44:44,950 --> 01:44:46,700
Proove your strengths.

1511
01:44:47,540 --> 01:44:50,660
I’ll break the plough of Balramudu into
thousand pieces with my weapon.

1512
01:44:53,540 --> 01:44:56,450
I’ll finish Balramudu himself with my arrow.

1513
01:44:57,700 --> 01:45:00,120
Oh no, looks like this test would lead to my death.

1514
01:45:00,200 --> 01:45:02,540
Round 2, test for your Intelligence.

1515
01:45:03,290 --> 01:45:07,870
For my boy's intellegence even Tenali Rama will
say your's is Tenali and ours is Tenali.

1516
01:45:07,910 --> 01:45:11,000
Stop your games now and call for Tunga Bhadra.

1517
01:45:11,200 --> 01:45:12,870
Subadhra... Subadhra...

1518
01:45:12,910 --> 01:45:14,830
Ok, onne are the other Boyapati Bhadra... Call her

1519
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:18,580
I think capital city Amaravathi can be
made ready by the time these girls get ready.

1520
01:45:24,370 --> 01:45:26,200
First question of second round...

1521
01:45:26,290 --> 01:45:31,580
Arjuna, whom would you say ok to, when
ten girls come at once and propose to you?

1522
01:45:31,620 --> 01:45:34,870
Damn! I won’t say anything but go
home taking phone numbers from all.

1523
01:45:34,950 --> 01:45:35,750
For what...?

1524
01:45:36,120 --> 01:45:38,830
I can then say ok each one of them separately, right?

1525
01:45:40,040 --> 01:45:42,750
Oh no, he is not Arjunudu but Manmadhaudu.

1526
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,620
Duryodhan, it’s your turn now.

1527
01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:49,200
What’s the difference between a man
and woman for you?

1528
01:45:49,250 --> 01:45:50,080
Very simple

1529
01:45:50,160 --> 01:45:53,620
Women wish for one man for all their needs.

1530
01:45:53,660 --> 01:45:57,750
But man wants ...

1531
01:45:57,790 --> 01:45:58,910
Hey...

1532
01:45:59,120 --> 01:46:01,330
Won’t your lust be down till your soul leaves your body?

1533
01:46:01,870 --> 01:46:02,830
What’s this guy ?

1534
01:46:02,870 --> 01:46:04,040
Still, what brother said is correct.

1535
01:46:04,290 --> 01:46:07,870
This guy keeps praising his brother like the anchors who
always praise the heroes continuously in the audio functions.

1536
01:46:09,370 --> 01:46:10,870
Now, the turn of Subadhra

1537
01:46:11,410 --> 01:46:12,160
Okay.

1538
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:16,450
I’ve seen your strengths till now and
even your telugu thetalu.

1539
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:20,040
Subbu, not telugu thetalu but intellegence.

1540
01:46:20,410 --> 01:46:24,330
What’ll you do when goons chase the girl you love?

1541
01:46:24,450 --> 01:46:27,580
What else, I’ll say it isn’t right
and give them a counseling.

1542
01:46:28,330 --> 01:46:30,120
Get them even a Kilo of rice for two rupees.

1543
01:46:30,200 --> 01:46:33,160
Will they sit calm till you give them counseling?
They would do damage and leave.

1544
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:34,000
Cowardness...

1545
01:46:34,120 --> 01:46:35,790
Duryodhana, what will you do?

1546
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:41,450
I’ll push all of those into the room, lock it
and bash them up with my weapon.

1547
01:46:41,540 --> 01:46:42,910
Yes, tell like that only...

1548
01:46:43,450 --> 01:46:45,620
What to do to win the heart of a girl, then?

1549
01:46:45,660 --> 01:46:46,450
Simple...

1550
01:46:46,540 --> 01:46:49,410
Put her in the room, bolt the door and with my weapon....

1551
01:46:52,660 --> 01:46:53,830
Hey, what are you doing man?

1552
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:55,500
Duryodhana!

1553
01:46:55,700 --> 01:46:56,790
You asked tell like that only?

1554
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,370
I said tell like that only but not the same matter.

1555
01:46:59,500 --> 01:46:59,910
Damn!

1556
01:47:00,830 --> 01:47:03,080
Still, what brother said is correct
- You hold on.

1557
01:47:04,040 --> 01:47:06,290
Arjuna...what about you?

1558
01:47:06,910 --> 01:47:10,540
We should convince the girl
and make her parents agree...

1559
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:14,750
and take care of her like a mother.

1560
01:47:16,330 --> 01:47:17,330
Well said!

1561
01:47:17,410 --> 01:47:22,450
You should have that kind of thinking in the mind
and putting her in the room and illtreating her.

1562
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:23,330
Is not manners.

1563
01:47:24,120 --> 01:47:28,160
Subbu, you’ve seen right?
Whom do you like in these two?

1564
01:47:28,450 --> 01:47:31,200
The person who has won my heart
is this Savyasaachi (Ambidextrous person).

1565
01:47:32,660 --> 01:47:33,450
Yes.

1566
01:47:35,330 --> 01:47:36,120
Subbu!

1567
01:47:42,250 --> 01:47:45,330
Arjuna... Arjuna!
- Brother in law... Brother in law, tell me.

1568
01:47:45,450 --> 01:47:47,830
After having pleased the elders with mythology...

1569
01:47:48,290 --> 01:47:51,870
You should now entertain
youngsters with the western.

1570
01:47:52,330 --> 01:47:54,160
Come on start with lagayithu...

1571
01:47:55,750 --> 01:48:00,000
In the very young tender age...

1572
01:48:00,250 --> 01:48:06,700
In Mysammaguda Mallareddy College...

1573
01:48:07,580 --> 01:48:12,250
This love story has started.

1574
01:48:12,750 --> 01:48:20,450
Nuisance chats in that canteen...
Bike ridings for the whole night.

1575
01:48:20,580 --> 01:48:24,370
All rumours around the village.

1576
01:48:24,830 --> 01:48:29,500
College days can never be forgotten...

1577
01:48:29,540 --> 01:48:31,000
Repeat...

1578
01:48:31,080 --> 01:48:37,330
College days can never be forgotten...

1579
01:48:37,500 --> 01:48:39,290
Yo... you rocked it bro...

1580
01:48:42,410 --> 01:48:45,910
Starting from when I saw you on the road...

1581
01:48:49,620 --> 01:48:52,910
From the day I turned into Romeo

1582
01:49:06,410 --> 01:49:09,830
From when I saw you on the road.

1583
01:49:09,910 --> 01:49:13,290
From the day I turned into Romeo.

1584
01:49:13,370 --> 01:49:16,700
A heat started in my heart.

1585
01:49:16,790 --> 01:49:19,580
She isn’t a babe but a duck.

1586
01:49:20,200 --> 01:49:23,540
From when I saw you in the class.

1587
01:49:23,750 --> 01:49:27,080
From when I asked you for a hug.

1588
01:49:27,120 --> 01:49:30,370
Junior Juliet is born in me.

1589
01:49:30,410 --> 01:49:33,160
See the depth of love now.

1590
01:49:34,290 --> 01:49:37,290
It’s getting harder...

1591
01:49:37,750 --> 01:49:40,950
My heart is buffering and falling at you.

1592
01:49:41,290 --> 01:49:43,250
You can never stop a legacy.

1593
01:49:43,330 --> 01:49:45,000
You can have miss a dynasty.

1594
01:49:45,040 --> 01:49:48,410
You can have a heart’s gravity.

1595
01:49:48,500 --> 01:49:49,950
Hey you demon.

1596
01:49:50,160 --> 01:49:51,830
Look at me for some time

1597
01:49:51,870 --> 01:49:55,120
You are my lover...

1598
01:50:08,620 --> 01:50:10,620
I won’t be quiet if you go red when I see you

1599
01:50:10,660 --> 01:50:12,250
I can’t surely live without seeing you

1600
01:50:12,290 --> 01:50:13,910
I can’t stop at all even when you say to stop

1601
01:50:13,950 --> 01:50:15,660
I’ll be surely yours someday

1602
01:50:15,700 --> 01:50:17,450
Let’s together go around the world.

1603
01:50:18,870 --> 01:50:22,410
Laila – Majnu...

1604
01:50:22,500 --> 01:50:25,870
Devadas – Paru...

1605
01:50:25,910 --> 01:50:32,040
I’m crazy and you’re crazy.

1606
01:50:32,250 --> 01:50:35,250
Hey baby, in Inorbit mall

1607
01:50:35,580 --> 01:50:38,700
In the theatre and at the dark corner.

1608
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:45,660
Touching through the hands
do you remember the romance.

1609
01:50:46,330 --> 01:50:49,910
In the late night and live chat..
So many songs in the heart beat.

1610
01:50:50,080 --> 01:50:54,580
Naughty thoughts and silly dreams...
How many do I say baby in the folds.

1611
01:50:54,620 --> 01:50:56,660
Seeing you on the road

1612
01:50:56,750 --> 01:50:59,540
From when I saw you in the class

1613
01:50:59,700 --> 01:51:02,950
From when I asked for your hug

1614
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:06,410
Junior Juliet is born in me.

1615
01:51:06,450 --> 01:51:09,450
See the depth of love now

1616
01:51:09,950 --> 01:51:13,370
From when I saw you on the road.

1617
01:51:13,450 --> 01:51:16,830
From the day I turned into Romeo.

1618
01:51:16,910 --> 01:51:20,250
A heat started in my heart.

1619
01:51:20,330 --> 01:51:23,120
She isn’t a babe but a duck.

1620
01:51:36,410 --> 01:51:37,500
What Nanda Kishore?

1621
01:51:38,290 --> 01:51:39,290
What are you thinking?

1622
01:51:39,500 --> 01:51:42,370
I feel he can come even if he’s not given a clue Sir.

1623
01:51:42,540 --> 01:51:46,160
Wow, you’ve a great confidence over him.

1624
01:51:46,290 --> 01:51:49,120
My confidence is not on his strength Sir,
but on his emotion.

1625
01:51:50,950 --> 01:51:54,080
Vikram, he's more clever and stronger than you.

1626
01:51:54,290 --> 01:51:59,410
To save baby you should use
more brains but not anger.

1627
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:14,160
If Arjuna, I’m in the places where he roamed.
Let’s see if he can find out and come.

1628
01:52:57,870 --> 01:52:59,870
He made me roam around
these places without any reason.

1629
01:53:00,200 --> 01:53:01,790
I should get a clue somewhere around here, Chitra.

1630
01:53:11,620 --> 01:53:15,580
Like this, he’s doing all crazy deeds
without any time or situation.

1631
01:53:15,830 --> 01:53:19,580
Damn! Even then when I was saving the boy,
he caught the car.

1632
01:53:25,080 --> 01:53:25,700
Tenali
- Sir.

1633
01:53:25,750 --> 01:53:26,330
Start the bike.

1634
01:53:28,080 --> 01:53:29,750
Sir, what’s this special effect?

1635
01:53:29,790 --> 01:53:31,410
Cement bandage, I put it very tight.

1636
01:53:31,580 --> 01:53:34,450
I too will see how he comes out even
if he gets very excited, move.

1637
01:53:40,620 --> 01:53:41,870
Right there... Stop here.

1638
01:54:00,750 --> 01:54:01,750
21...

1639
01:54:43,580 --> 01:54:44,410
Hey...

1640
01:55:22,450 --> 01:55:22,950
Sir...

1641
01:55:23,160 --> 01:55:25,660
Enough of commas...now it's full stop.

1642
01:55:26,200 --> 01:55:26,700
kill him.

1643
01:55:31,370 --> 01:55:34,830
The wonder that happened in
your life is a surprise for the world.

1644
01:55:35,660 --> 01:55:37,200
Whoever may understand or not,

1645
01:55:37,540 --> 01:55:40,370
he is your elder brother and you’re his younger brother.

1646
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:55,120
When brothers sharing the same blood
have so much of love,

1647
01:55:56,790 --> 01:56:00,080
how much love should you both have with
the same blood flowing in the same body?

1648
01:56:26,040 --> 01:56:32,700
(Sanskrit Sloka...)

1649
01:56:56,200 --> 01:57:02,870
(Sanskrit Sloka...)

1650
01:58:11,410 --> 01:58:13,410
who sent you?
-don't know.

1651
01:58:18,120 --> 01:58:20,080
Where does the guy who sent you stays?
-don't know.

1652
01:58:32,750 --> 01:58:36,330
Tell the guy who sent you that Aadi is in form...

1653
01:58:38,620 --> 01:58:41,080
Death is confirmed for him.

1654
01:59:11,910 --> 01:59:14,330
Make me sleep, uncle

1655
01:59:22,500 --> 01:59:26,830
For even the death to reach you,
it should cross your left hand and come.

1656
01:59:35,660 --> 01:59:37,950
There’s something in that number 21.

1657
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,080
Is he trying to convey anything through that number?

1658
01:59:50,040 --> 01:59:53,660
Both became good friends, right Sir?
Maybe Aadi Sir wants to play with you.

1659
02:00:27,660 --> 02:00:28,370
Yes.

1660
02:00:29,250 --> 02:00:31,290
That is the number of passengers from the
bus which met with accident.

1661
02:00:31,870 --> 02:00:33,330
He’s trying to say the same thing.

1662
02:00:34,750 --> 02:00:38,500
I heard some name continuously
before that bus met with accident.

1663
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:00,700
Arun...

1664
02:01:00,790 --> 02:01:01,700
I know Arun.

1665
02:01:01,790 --> 02:01:02,790
Even I know Arun.

1666
02:01:05,540 --> 02:01:06,750
Even I know Arun

1667
02:01:14,410 --> 02:01:15,200
Arun!

1668
02:01:16,160 --> 02:01:18,620
The name I heard last before the
accident took place was Arun.

1669
02:01:22,660 --> 02:01:26,830
If we know the relation between Arun
and those who died in accident,

1670
02:01:27,910 --> 02:01:32,160
we’ll know who that Arun is and why’s he doing all this.

1671
02:01:33,750 --> 02:01:34,700
Kittu
- Yes.

1672
02:01:58,200 --> 02:01:59,750
These are the passengers.

1673
02:02:00,200 --> 02:02:03,200
She’s the teacher from Arun’s school
and her name is Nirmala Madam.

1674
02:02:17,700 --> 02:02:20,290
They all have a reason for coming into that bus.

1675
02:02:21,830 --> 02:02:25,040
But how did I come? How am I connected?

1676
02:02:28,410 --> 02:02:31,580
Actually even sister and brother in law
should have come in the same bus.

1677
02:02:33,370 --> 02:02:36,830
(Sanskrit Sloka...)

1678
02:02:44,870 --> 02:02:49,040
So, the sanskrit slokas he recites on phone
are the marriage chants.

1679
02:02:50,290 --> 02:02:51,330
His name is Arun

1680
02:02:55,120 --> 02:02:56,330
Arun Raj...

1681
02:03:04,790 --> 02:03:05,750
Dad...

1682
02:03:07,330 --> 02:03:10,160
Sister doesn’t like this marriage.
She loves another man.

1683
02:03:11,040 --> 02:03:12,830
Why didn’t she say so when the
marriage proposal had come?

1684
02:03:14,330 --> 02:03:15,410
She fears you, dad.

1685
02:03:15,870 --> 02:03:17,870
Ask her to continue the same fear for two more days.

1686
02:03:19,540 --> 02:03:23,620
If she continues for two more days,
we too will have to feel sad for lifelong along with her, dad.

1687
02:03:24,290 --> 02:03:28,410
You think to stop the marriage is as easy as
to write exams in September when you fail in March?

1688
02:03:29,450 --> 02:03:32,500
Vikram, you’re just looking
at your sister’s Love.

1689
02:03:32,750 --> 02:03:34,950
and I’m looking at her life and future.

1690
02:03:35,580 --> 02:03:40,160
In general when we enquire about bridegroom,
they say whether he is good or bad.

1691
02:03:40,790 --> 02:03:43,500
But enquiring about Raj,
they’re saying to be careful, dad.

1692
02:03:43,750 --> 02:03:45,620
Vikram, you say whatever.

1693
02:03:46,160 --> 02:03:48,330
It isn’t possible to stop this marriage after coming so far.

1694
02:03:48,750 --> 02:03:50,910
I’ll be ready at the stage to bless.

1695
02:03:59,660 --> 02:04:03,830
(Marriage chants)

1696
02:04:28,830 --> 02:04:31,120
The girl is lucky and left even before the marriage.

1697
02:04:31,330 --> 02:04:33,660
Knowing about him after marriage,
she should die.

1698
02:04:33,950 --> 02:04:37,870
He should've died long back
for the bad luck he has.

1699
02:04:38,950 --> 02:04:40,660
Don’t stop the chants, priest.

1700
02:04:40,790 --> 02:04:45,000
(Marriage chants)

1701
02:04:56,910 --> 02:05:02,040
The danger which I didn’t want to happen six year back
and got you out holding this hand,

1702
02:05:03,540 --> 02:05:06,370
that same danger is now haunting us like a shadow, sister.

1703
02:05:08,540 --> 02:05:11,040
Reason for him to be doing all these is the revenge.

1704
02:05:13,080 --> 02:05:16,000
But, I winning over him isn’t a revenge, sister.

1705
02:05:16,790 --> 02:05:19,120
It’s a need. I will win.

1706
02:05:20,120 --> 02:05:20,830
Vikram...

1707
02:05:22,450 --> 02:05:25,580
I can’t again see my husband whom
I thought was my life.

1708
02:05:26,290 --> 02:05:30,330
If Maha is mom to you, she’s
remembrance of your brother in law to me.

1709
02:05:38,040 --> 02:05:41,160
I want that remembrance and you should bring that.

1710
02:05:47,080 --> 02:05:49,250
Hey, with the information you said,
we didn’t know where he stays.

1711
02:05:49,410 --> 02:05:53,040
But we got his father’s details.
This is his photo and address is behind

1712
02:05:57,870 --> 02:06:03,200
Listen dear, I’m in no way in a position to provide
justice to what all injustice you had faced.

1713
02:06:04,040 --> 02:06:07,620
If humans turn so when up bringing is not good,

1714
02:06:08,120 --> 02:06:10,790
then I too have a part in all the cruel deeds done by him.

1715
02:06:14,250 --> 02:06:18,330
Arun, what happened to you?
Do you understand what you’re doing?

1716
02:06:18,620 --> 02:06:21,200
All these are common in this field.
have you gone mad?

1717
02:06:22,160 --> 02:06:25,000
Yes, I have gone mad dad.

1718
02:06:25,450 --> 02:06:26,950
I feel like to dying.

1719
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,250
You tore the papers as they didn’t write a good review.

1720
02:06:32,750 --> 02:06:35,290
You threw away the tab and
you are trying to break the TV.

1721
02:06:35,660 --> 02:06:37,950
But what will you do and stop the
public saying the same thing?

1722
02:06:39,540 --> 02:06:43,540
Still, why should you kill your self?
You should do something and shut the public’s mouth.

1723
02:06:55,660 --> 02:06:58,120
Arun, what’s all this?

1724
02:06:59,410 --> 02:07:00,700
What you said is true dad.

1725
02:07:02,660 --> 02:07:03,870
Why should I die?

1726
02:07:05,250 --> 02:07:07,330
Those who made me feel bad should die.

1727
02:07:08,660 --> 02:07:11,370
I made a beautiful plan which no one can escape.

1728
02:07:11,910 --> 02:07:12,950
This is the design

1729
02:07:16,790 --> 02:07:21,870
Hey, I told you to achieve something
and show it to all but not to kill.

1730
02:07:22,250 --> 02:07:27,290
If you had invested this time and brain on something else,
you would have become another Einstein.

1731
02:07:27,330 --> 02:07:28,410
They’re not letting me become, dad.

1732
02:07:28,540 --> 02:07:29,370
Who?

1733
02:07:29,450 --> 02:07:31,410
The humans dad, humans.

1734
02:07:31,750 --> 02:07:38,250
Whenever I wanted to forget everything and start
a new life, I was again and again getting insulted.

1735
02:07:38,290 --> 02:07:43,660
But, I’ll give the answer for each and every insult.

1736
02:07:45,120 --> 02:07:49,040
Only one answer.
I'll answer all of them at once.

1737
02:07:49,580 --> 02:07:52,750
Arun listen, this isn’t the way.

1738
02:07:53,370 --> 02:07:55,450
You can’t win the life with Revenge.

1739
02:07:55,870 --> 02:07:56,870
Listen to me.

1740
02:07:57,330 --> 02:08:00,410
You need a break. Go on a trip wherever you like

1741
02:08:00,790 --> 02:08:04,370
Yes dad, you are correct.

1742
02:08:05,830 --> 02:08:07,330
I need a good trip

1743
02:08:10,540 --> 02:08:13,540
I did not speak to him from that day.

1744
02:08:14,080 --> 02:08:16,250
He too didn’t meet me.

1745
02:08:16,660 --> 02:08:21,660
The blood relation stopped me
from saying all this to the world and the Police.

1746
02:08:28,120 --> 02:08:32,160
You said you'll meet me, will give a twist
and said killing me is the climax.

1747
02:08:32,250 --> 02:08:35,450
Why are you now doing time pass
saying mom and dad?

1748
02:08:35,700 --> 02:08:40,540
Hey, am I your Brother in law to do time pass or
you are my sister’s husband?

1749
02:08:40,700 --> 02:08:41,790
Sister’s husband!

1750
02:08:43,330 --> 02:08:45,120
Nice, really nice!

1751
02:08:45,410 --> 02:08:47,910
Fantastic, you decoded superbly.

1752
02:08:48,750 --> 02:08:50,830
Seriously, I am unable to stop myself
from appreciating you..

1753
02:08:51,160 --> 02:08:54,250
I wished to kill you the first in my total list, but...

1754
02:08:55,040 --> 02:08:56,450
You became the last.

1755
02:08:56,910 --> 02:08:58,540
What’s a list to kill, idiot?

1756
02:08:58,790 --> 02:09:02,200
You think they’re humans or
any items to make a list and kill?

1757
02:09:03,120 --> 02:09:05,540
You kill humans for the small things?

1758
02:09:05,580 --> 02:09:06,700
What’s a small thing?

1759
02:09:06,790 --> 02:09:10,540
When I made a camera in 10th class,
instead of appreciating my knowledge,

1760
02:09:10,830 --> 02:09:16,160
They accused me of planting it (camera) in
a ladies hostel, and beating me up is a small thing?

1761
02:09:16,450 --> 02:09:20,250
When I made a documentary with great hard work,
instead of identifying good in it,

1762
02:09:20,450 --> 02:09:25,750
just highlighting the bad and
torturing me mentally, is it a small thing ?

1763
02:09:27,200 --> 02:09:31,750
When I intended to marry a girl of
my dreams and about to start a new life,

1764
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:38,040
taking away the bride on the day of wedding,
is that a small thing..? Tell me.

1765
02:09:39,700 --> 02:09:42,040
Oh... I mean, if you say all these are small things,

1766
02:09:42,450 --> 02:09:48,290
then killing those humans who killed
my hopes and goals too is a small thing.

1767
02:09:49,620 --> 02:09:55,450
That's why, I planned to kill all at once
and executed that.

1768
02:09:57,410 --> 02:10:01,330
The weapon I used to bring so many
on to one platform is “FREE”.

1769
02:10:01,700 --> 02:10:05,580
I just put one message as free trip and all came.

1770
02:10:07,290 --> 02:10:09,790
I killed all those I wanted to kill in one shot.

1771
02:10:10,120 --> 02:10:13,660
But only your family I am compelled to kill in instalments.

1772
02:10:14,080 --> 02:10:17,580
You know, how I wanted to kill
your family members who escaped from that accident?

1773
02:10:18,660 --> 02:10:20,950
Coming to your house as a
service executive from a gas company ...

1774
02:10:23,160 --> 02:10:25,120
and fixed a bomb to the cylinder

1775
02:10:27,410 --> 02:10:30,040
Sree, why didn’t Maha still come?

1776
02:10:30,370 --> 02:10:32,870
Today they’ve culturals... she’ll come at 4:30.

1777
02:10:45,620 --> 02:10:47,660
Oh no, are you feeling sad?

1778
02:10:47,950 --> 02:10:49,160
I too felt the same.

1779
02:10:49,700 --> 02:10:53,790
Poor girl would become an orphan after everyone dies.

1780
02:10:54,160 --> 02:10:57,040
that's why I went to her school to kill her.

1781
02:11:11,370 --> 02:11:13,700
Uncle, go carefully.

1782
02:11:14,040 --> 02:11:21,580
After seeing the girl who saved me from danger when
I tried to kill her, a new hope for life emerged in me.

1783
02:11:23,410 --> 02:11:24,450
What’s your name?

1784
02:11:24,790 --> 02:11:26,200
Mahalaxmi.

1785
02:11:28,950 --> 02:11:32,370
If everything had happened as I wished,
I too would have had a baby like this.

1786
02:11:33,620 --> 02:11:36,870
For the fruit to be ours,
there is no rule that the seed needs to be ours.

1787
02:11:38,040 --> 02:11:40,700
So technically, Maha is mine

1788
02:11:42,290 --> 02:11:45,830
Thus, I created proofs that even
the baby died in that blast.

1789
02:11:46,120 --> 02:11:48,250
At a time when I was thinking that
I can live happily with the kid,

1790
02:11:48,370 --> 02:11:50,000
you came to know that she was alive.

1791
02:11:52,500 --> 02:11:57,080
Don’t worry Chinni,
I’m taking better care of her than you.

1792
02:11:58,250 --> 02:12:01,450
I’m giving everything she likes even before she is asking.

1793
02:12:02,370 --> 02:12:08,200
So, finally you won’t get any calls from me now onwards.

1794
02:12:08,700 --> 02:12:13,540
Thank you Chinni, good bye and Good luck.
Hey, wait...

1795
02:12:13,830 --> 02:12:17,040
One minute, I thought to tell you a feeling and forgot.

1796
02:12:17,830 --> 02:12:23,450
When what we want and what we wish is becoming ours,
how happy the feeling is.

1797
02:12:33,910 --> 02:12:35,160
Oh no!

1798
02:12:35,200 --> 02:12:45,700
On the auspicious day of 10-04-2012, at 9:30 AM
Sridevi daughter of Hyderabad resident Bhaskar Rao...

1799
02:12:45,750 --> 02:12:46,330
Tell me...

1800
02:12:46,450 --> 02:12:48,660
Hey, I told you to be with sister right?
Where did you go?

1801
02:12:48,830 --> 02:12:50,450
You asked me to come to the reception, right?

1802
02:12:50,620 --> 02:12:51,700
Hey, when did I?

1803
02:13:05,080 --> 02:13:08,000
Why are you looking like that?
Am I that handsome?

1804
02:13:08,370 --> 02:13:12,750
A person who has cruelly killed other human beings...
does he also look like a human being is my doubt.

1805
02:13:12,790 --> 02:13:14,040
Yes... I was like a human only.

1806
02:13:15,540 --> 02:13:17,910
If I’m like this now, it’s because of you.

1807
02:13:19,450 --> 02:13:20,410
Anyways,

1808
02:13:21,120 --> 02:13:25,410
the matter is I killed all I wanted to, in one shot.

1809
02:13:25,910 --> 02:13:28,910
But am having to kill your family in instalments.

1810
02:13:30,500 --> 02:13:32,290
They say marriage is the base to a new life

1811
02:13:32,910 --> 02:13:37,250
Your brother who made such a
life not come to me on one side...

1812
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:41,330
And the other 20 who stopped
success coming to me on the other side...

1813
02:13:42,950 --> 02:13:44,500
That's why, I played well with that fellow.

1814
02:13:46,450 --> 02:13:49,700
He is the courage behind that laugh, right?

1815
02:13:50,330 --> 02:13:51,290
Yes.

1816
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:57,450
I will kill that courage and even kill him.

1817
02:13:58,540 --> 02:14:01,290
What... since a while you are saying
it's a single person, single person?

1818
02:14:02,080 --> 02:14:04,500
He’s not one person, but two.

1819
02:14:06,660 --> 02:14:07,620
Twins?

1820
02:14:08,250 --> 02:14:12,540
Yes, two. But Two in just one man

1821
02:14:13,290 --> 02:14:14,160
Wow...

1822
02:14:14,790 --> 02:14:18,080
two guys in one. Interesting!

1823
02:14:18,660 --> 02:14:20,200
Have you ever thought?

1824
02:14:21,120 --> 02:14:29,250
In a valley that took 400 lives, just one person
only survived. Who do you think has saved his life?

1825
02:14:46,120 --> 02:14:51,450
When one person was requesting dad that it's wrong
to get me married to an idiot like you,

1826
02:14:52,080 --> 02:14:56,290
who was the other guy, who took his sister by hand?

1827
02:15:07,410 --> 02:15:10,160
You would’ve sent many to kill him, right?

1828
02:15:10,950 --> 02:15:15,910
But still, who’s the reason for the
death not even go closer to him?

1829
02:15:22,200 --> 02:15:23,160
Aditya!

1830
02:15:24,330 --> 02:15:25,660
Vikram, Aditya!

1831
02:15:27,160 --> 02:15:29,620
Aditya is the same as Vikram to me.

1832
02:15:44,040 --> 02:15:47,540
They both will come and take me and Maha.

1833
02:15:48,620 --> 02:15:51,620
A new story, two guys in just one!

1834
02:15:51,870 --> 02:15:53,950
One man two soul...

1835
02:15:54,040 --> 02:15:55,500
Two soul one body...

1836
02:15:55,540 --> 02:15:56,620
One body two soul...

1837
02:15:56,660 --> 02:15:58,250
Let’s have all this calculation later.

1838
02:15:59,160 --> 02:16:00,580
One bullet is enough, right?

1839
02:16:03,720 --> 02:16:06,510
I’m taking better care of her than you.

1840
02:16:06,640 --> 02:16:09,850
I’m giving everything she wants
even before she asks for.

1841
02:16:10,550 --> 02:16:13,140
Maha, how many times did I say not to eat ice cream?

1842
02:16:14,470 --> 02:16:17,970
Chinni, I like this V Rewind ice cream

1843
02:16:18,430 --> 02:16:19,890
I need a hundred

1844
02:16:20,970 --> 02:16:23,050
you'll get this Ice cream only in our V Rewind.

1845
02:16:28,100 --> 02:16:31,850
What Sir, you come daily by three sharp
and today you are late by 15 minutes?

1846
02:16:32,890 --> 02:16:33,640
Thank you sir.

1847
02:18:09,930 --> 02:18:13,890
What Nanda Kishore,
does he still look like Arjun for you?

1848
02:18:16,550 --> 02:18:18,680
It has come, Vikram... it has come.

1849
02:18:18,930 --> 02:18:21,050
That climax you mentioned has come.

1850
02:18:21,970 --> 02:18:27,220
But I pity seeing you coming so far to die.

1851
02:18:27,350 --> 02:18:28,680
So, foolish.

1852
02:18:30,720 --> 02:18:33,470
He’s laughing even in such situations means,
Nanda Kishore...

1853
02:18:33,760 --> 02:18:35,850
he seems to be a crazier guy than me.

1854
02:18:36,510 --> 02:18:38,350
He’s laughing imagining about
what’s going to happen Sir.

1855
02:18:43,140 --> 02:18:44,720
We won’t let that happen, right?

1856
02:18:44,800 --> 02:18:46,640
What is it that you will not allow to happen, rascal?

1857
02:18:48,350 --> 02:18:51,680
You're here, that means baby is here too.

1858
02:18:52,180 --> 02:18:54,550
This is enough idiot, to give you a perfect send of...

1859
02:19:01,010 --> 02:19:02,100
Bad investment.

1860
02:19:05,180 --> 02:19:07,140
Technically that is your baby?

1861
02:19:08,760 --> 02:19:12,970
You’re not fit to be even her far relative also, rascal.

1862
02:19:23,050 --> 02:19:25,640
He’s been calm all these days not having
clarity on whom to hit, Sir.

1863
02:19:25,970 --> 02:19:27,800
After he got that clarity, this is his reaction.

1864
02:19:48,100 --> 02:19:49,550
Oh no...

1865
02:19:49,890 --> 02:19:55,300
Taking the scars from history and demons from the
epics as idols, you made the demon in you so big.

1866
02:19:55,640 --> 02:19:58,050
Time for that demon is getting over.

1867
02:19:58,470 --> 02:20:00,510
If you have to do anything, Do it right now.

1868
02:20:02,300 --> 02:20:05,430
At least now, say where are the baby and sister?

1869
02:20:07,390 --> 02:20:08,680
Nanda Kishore
- Sir

1870
02:20:37,010 --> 02:20:40,800
Maha...Just 10 minutes dear,
we shall go back home.

1871
02:20:40,850 --> 02:20:41,470
Is it..!

1872
02:20:42,220 --> 02:20:44,220
What damn, you dirty warden rascal!

1873
02:21:10,140 --> 02:21:11,470
Chinni!

1874
02:21:17,100 --> 02:21:18,430
Hi, Chinni!

1875
02:21:22,550 --> 02:21:23,510
Mahaa!

1876
02:21:24,350 --> 02:21:25,850
Uncle!

1877
02:21:28,890 --> 02:21:30,050
Chinni!

1878
02:21:34,680 --> 02:21:35,640
Uncle...!

1879
02:21:38,220 --> 02:21:39,180
Uncle.

1880
02:21:39,640 --> 02:21:41,010
Uncle.
-Maha...

1881
02:21:44,640 --> 02:21:45,800
Maha! don't come.

1882
02:21:52,640 --> 02:21:54,640
Uncle.

1883
02:21:54,760 --> 02:21:56,850
Maha... don't come. no.

1884
02:22:01,680 --> 02:22:02,970
Chinni!

1885
02:22:38,720 --> 02:22:39,680
Mahaa...

1886
02:22:40,010 --> 02:22:41,350
Uncle.

1887
02:23:03,100 --> 02:23:04,470
Maha... you are fine, right...!

1888
02:23:46,300 --> 02:23:48,300
What’s there in your left hand ?

1889
02:23:48,600 --> 02:23:50,640
You could know all about me

1890
02:23:51,680 --> 02:23:55,720
but couldn’t know what was there in all over my body.

1891
02:23:59,180 --> 02:24:05,600
If Galileo for not being recognized, Einstein for being thrown
out from school had taken it in a negative manner like you,

1892
02:24:06,470 --> 02:24:09,600
world would’ve missed many wonderful wizards.

1893
02:24:13,140 --> 02:24:14,800
Arun, shall I tell one thing finally?

1894
02:24:16,100 --> 02:24:19,430
If one uses his brains for good, he is called a wizard.

1895
02:24:20,550 --> 02:24:26,050
If it is used to kill humans like this,
he is called as a psycho.

1896
02:24:28,390 --> 02:24:35,140
If destruction is the goal and the intelligence is
used for destruction, both will result in one's own sacrifice.

1897
02:24:41,430 --> 02:24:42,510
Nanda Kishore...

1898
02:24:43,010 --> 02:24:43,550
Sir.

1899
02:25:15,180 --> 02:25:16,550
Mummy!

1900
02:25:19,760 --> 02:25:20,760
Mummy!

1901
02:25:25,510 --> 02:25:26,470
Mahaa...
-Mummy!

1902
02:25:29,140 --> 02:25:30,100
Mummy!

1903
02:25:30,800 --> 02:25:31,510
Maha...

1904
02:25:52,720 --> 02:25:54,220
This fellow is very good.

1905
02:25:54,930 --> 02:25:56,510
Unneccessarily I misunderstood him.

1906
02:25:57,100 --> 02:25:59,970
Actually, he is a good guy than me.

1907
02:26:00,180 --> 02:26:01,970
From now onwards we are best brothers.

1908
02:26:07,100 --> 02:26:09,350
What the hell...
-Maam, I am sorry.

1909
02:26:09,600 --> 02:26:12,100
Chitra.. It's not me... you know it, right?
-If it is not you than who else?

1910
02:26:12,140 --> 02:26:14,850
It means... It's me... but it's not me.

1911
02:26:14,890 --> 02:26:16,550
Please believe me.
-What are you talking?

1912
02:26:16,850 --> 02:26:19,390
Chitra you know it right?please tell.
- who knows...

1913
02:26:19,760 --> 02:26:22,100
May be you are acting smart taking shelter behind him.

1914
02:26:22,260 --> 02:26:24,350
just now you told me... he is better than you.

1915
02:26:24,430 --> 02:26:25,930
Chitra please listen to me...
-Hey don't talk.

1916
02:26:26,720 --> 02:26:27,140
Chitra...

1917
02:26:27,180 --> 02:26:29,350
Are you not ashamed to behave like this
keeping your girl friend by the side.

1918
02:26:29,680 --> 02:26:32,260
Hey... hey... one minute please
Chitra... Chitra...

1919
02:26:36,680 --> 02:26:37,640
Are you happy now?
