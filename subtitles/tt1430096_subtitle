1
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:01,439
Come... step in.

2
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:39,483
Revamma... are you Kutty Srank's wife?

3
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:42,650
No

4
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:45,255
Were you not living together?

5
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:47,824
No...

6
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:49,655
Used to come by sometimes

7
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:56,799
That way...

8
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,901
Do you know how he died?

9
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:01,671
I don't.

10
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:05,105
Get, head constable Kanaran.

11
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:11,113
Do you know this man?

12
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,351
-I know him
-Tell us, how did Srank die?

13
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:15,780
Revenge, Sir...

14
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:19,684
He cleared out of here after screwing
over Revamma's old man, Moopan.

15
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:21,757
No. that was not how it was.

16
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,294
Disappearing with a man's daughter.
What else does one call it sir?

17
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:25,756
No, it wasn't like that

18
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:28,959
Then how?

19
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:56,052
Tomorrow she is coming,
after fourteen years

20
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:57,454
Who?

21
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:02,595
...Revamma, my little girl

22
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,597
She never came, these
past fourteen years.

23
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,734
I've been waiting.

24
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:11,843
She'll arrive at the pier tomorrow.
In a sailing ship

25
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:14,370
You are the one to go fetch her.

26
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:16,047
Right... you may go now.

27
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:18,575
Wait, one more thing.

28
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:22,878
Clean up the blood and guts in
our abattoir near the chapel...

29
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,383
...and wash it down.

30
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:27,316
I'll clean up the place.

31
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:28,457
Have to go at dawn...

32
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:30,890
Have to throw out the filth and guts.

33
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:32,229
Don't forget.

34
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:34,265
You must be at the pier at daybreak.

35
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:11,432
Washing over and over
doesn't get rid of it.

36
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:20,779
For nonbelievers,
this blood is just water.

37
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:24,282
If you believe,
even water is divine.

38
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,357
Where were you all this while?

39
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:41,697
No wonder, brother Moopan says...

40
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:42,992
What does Moopan say indeed?

41
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,498
After all he is a Kutty Srank
(small-time captain Kutty).

42
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,763
Just that nobody can say where he'll
disappear and where he'll surface again.

43
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:51,699
We've been waiting here for you
since dawn, to go with you to the pier.

44
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:53,912
How can one rely on you, Kutty Srank?

45
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,340
Brother Moopan is the
only one who trusts you...

46
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:59,181
...you, his lieutenant.

47
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:02,480
Come, lets go. Let's not
waste any more time.

48
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,332
What's wrong?

49
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:19,571
Blood!

50
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:23,638
When she returns after fourteen years...

51
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:25,537
...blood again.

52
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,351
You know how long
the journey from Colombo is,

53
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,383
...don't you?

54
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:44,496
If the storms keep away, one week

55
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:19,387
Tie the rope.

56
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:07,505
Let me try...

57
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:09,046
Uncle

58
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,113
Madhavi aunty

59
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:23,954
This is Prasanna.
A Buddhist monk.

60
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:26,358
He went to medical school with me.

61
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,430
He is on his way to Gaya

62
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,433
Is the monk's house in Gaya?

63
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:31,827
No, no...

64
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:35,906
A lot of Indians are converting to
Buddhism at a ceremony in Gaya.

65
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,301
These people are all going to
join them for that ceremony.

66
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,306
Then why did he disembark here?

67
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,109
To see our land.

68
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,316
To visit all the ancient
temples around here.

69
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:47,008
Will be here for a week

70
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,782
Then we'll go to Gaya after that.

71
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:52,356
Let him go...
Why are you also going along?

72
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,187
It's better if brother doesn't know.

73
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:55,921
Why shouldn't father know?

74
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:57,620
Shall tell him by myself.

75
00:09:58,464 --> 00:09:59,590
Let him go...

76
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,226
No, that won't do.

77
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:04,728
If Prasanna goes back in this ship
I'll go too.

78
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:06,496
You will have to then go tell father that.

79
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:24,113
Brother Moopan's blood runs in her too.

80
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:25,255
She won't give in.

81
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,559
If she says she will go,
then she will.

82
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,424
She has always been like that.

83
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:31,793
She is more man than a lady.

84
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:37,859
How can we possibly go to
Moopan's place with this monk?

85
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:40,996
There is a way.

86
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:43,571
We can put him up in the south wing
of our house at Panamoodu.

87
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:45,644
You mean, in that haunted house?

88
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,011
It's all good.

89
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:50,713
The monk will decamp in a week at best.

90
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,611
No one will go there looking for him.

91
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,817
Just that brother Moopan shouldn't know.

92
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:59,090
-But...
-But what?

93
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:05,596
Brother Moopan is like God for him.

94
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:07,756
He shouldn't spill the beans.

95
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,276
What's wrong my dear?

96
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:36,722
I have to tell you
something important.

97
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:51,139
You shouldn't tell father
about the monk just yet.

98
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:07,223
Don't you want to go see father?

99
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:11,018
When are you going to go see him?

100
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:12,295
Now

101
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:16,830
Like this, without showering,
wearing white?

102
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,366
To go visit, all cleaned up
and showered? Who is he? God?

103
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,371
You shouldn't say such things...

104
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:24,667
You are inviting God's wrath.

105
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:27,912
God never kicked anyone to death?

106
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:54,660
Didn't Madhavi give you the new dresses?

107
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:56,495
I haven't showered.

108
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,997
Alright, after that is fine

109
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:03,305
Let Madhavi know if you need anything.

110
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,739
For things outside the house,
tell Kutty Srank.

111
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:08,403
He is the only one
I trust around here

112
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:38,169
Came somewhere from south

113
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,844
He is always within earshot.

114
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:44,143
I have summoned all our folks
here Friday afternoon...

115
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:46,545
...for something concerning you.

116
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:48,847
Concerning me?

117
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:52,853
What I have in mind for you,
I will say then.

118
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,333
I will also speak then.

119
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:07,956
If not, brother Moopan will
kill that monk. I am sure.

120
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:09,530
You know that.

121
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:11,264
You must look the other way.

122
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:12,730
Don't do it for me...

123
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:16,536
but do it for the poor girl who
returned home after 14 years.

124
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:18,867
A week at most,

125
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,408
at least until she is married off.

126
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:26,084
Do you want his blood
spilled here before that?

127
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:28,243
Absolutely not.

128
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:32,782
I do not want to hear or know
anything that Moopan doesn't know.

129
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,459
Even if it is his own brother
hiding the truth.

130
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,292
I am going to tell
him this.. right now.

131
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,616
One week.

132
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:10,116
If the monk is here on the eighth day
I will tell for sure.

133
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:14,593
I'll grab him by his neck and
drive him across the river.

134
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,797
You better keep an eye
on him till then.

135
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,219
Kutty Srank?

136
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:14,353
Moopan's boat driver?

137
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:18,719
No... His general.

138
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:26,660
Must have blood on your hands
that does not wash off...

139
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:31,571
Don't forget the big feast on Friday.

140
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,107
It's for you too, Revamma.

141
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,608
Will your Moopan invite Prasanna too?

142
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:37,247
Or I would invite him myself.

143
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:58,829
Prasanna won't be coming
for the feast

144
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,382
-Madhavi...
-Yes

145
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:32,095
Why is she not here?

146
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:34,557
-She'll come.
-You go fetch her.

147
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,115
Darling... Why are you so?

148
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:56,620
Father and everyone else is
waiting for you over there.

149
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:00,091
I am not coming

150
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:02,393
I can't... Tell father that.

151
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:04,394
Don't say that darling.

152
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:07,256
-Father...
-I won't come.

153
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:09,094
You go ahead...

154
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:50,041
I have not told him
about Prasanna.

155
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:52,667
That was my first mistake.

156
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:57,015
A bit of treachery
for the junior Moopathy

157
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:01,118
I have a name.
You should use that.

158
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:06,285
Revamma should come there now,
that is what is needed.

159
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:09,285
Moopan's prestige is at stake.

160
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:12,853
Don't do such things in front of everyone.

161
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:14,588
Do I have to teach you these things?

162
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:19,000
Alright I will come

163
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,335
Do you think... I agreed to come
Because of someone...

164
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:31,246
who goes about ready to die
and kill for Moopan?

165
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:35,647
It is for my mother...
who loved and trusted me.

166
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:41,617
For my mother who was killed
right before my eyes by father.

167
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:20,727
I am standing before you...
to announce an important matter.

168
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:22,797
My daughter Revamma seated here...

169
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:26,903
..has returned from Ceylon after
finishing medical school.

170
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:30,903
She will be the doctor...
at the new hospital I am building.

171
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:37,471
She will be the heir to all
my property except the saw mill.

172
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:51,959
I have arranged for her marriage also.

173
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:55,299
A well known doctor
from Mangalaapuram.

174
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,467
He will also move to the
new hospital after the wedding.

175
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,103
He is in London at the moment...

176
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:02,368
...and will return in six months...

177
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,766
The wedding will be on the first of
the month of Chingam after he returns.

178
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,238
His folks are coming
for the betrothal.

179
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:13,081
It's my desire that all of you
should be present at this occasion.

180
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:16,111
I will not agree to this marriage.

181
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:18,319
I do not want this
blood-tainted wealth.

182
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:21,626
I am going to Gaya to
embrace Buddhism.

183
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:25,658
I am going to Gaya to
embrace Buddhism.

184
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:21,409
He must be under pain.

185
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:24,813
Kutty Srank, you may go...

186
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,186
I have to sleep a bit

187
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,740
Come, Kutty Srank,
come on in, take a seat

188
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:45,239
I did not come here to sit.

189
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:46,972
I don't want your hospitality.

190
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,907
Take your snacks and
shove it down the throat...

191
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,913
...of that son-of-a-bitch
you are hiding next door.

192
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,213
You know well Kutty Srank

193
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:56,752
We have put up the monk
here for Revamma's sake...

194
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:59,750
Still, who would have thought
she would say such things.

195
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:01,825
I have wronged Moopan badly.

196
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,158
I came here after seeing
Moopan's heart shatter...

197
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,697
Shouldn't have.

198
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,859
I should not have played
along with this.

199
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,126
He should have met
his end in my hands...

200
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:12,802
and you all in Moopan's.

201
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,304
Laughing...eh.
Just try laughing once more.

202
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:03,250
Leave him
Don't beat him

203
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:40,022
I shall be with you
even in renunciation.

204
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:43,293
Perhaps it has been ordained.

205
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:48,521
It might be the atonement
for all the sins of my father.

206
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:54,865
The blood that spattered
from the saw is still on me.

207
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:02,977
If only mother were here to
wipe the blood from my mind.

208
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,612
Let the fairness of those sins...

209
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,715
...die away with my penance...

210
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:17,354
Let me remain celibate and
virgin woman for ever.

211
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:46,617
If you are a man...

212
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:50,255
If Moopan's attack dog
has the guts, hit me.

213
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:53,188
Why did you have to
beat up this innocent man?

214
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,405
Do you know Srank,

215
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:07,271
I am a fallen woman...

216
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:13,014
my skin is dead.

217
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:16,086
This skin isn't even mine,

218
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:20,755
If touched I don't even feel it.

219
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,060
Touch...

220
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:27,420
That feeling melted away
thorough my fear.

221
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,333
Because, I know the reason.

222
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:36,873
The blood that was spattered
on me in my childhood.

223
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:39,132
I began fading away...

224
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:44,407
I fade away a bit more with the blood...

225
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:47,280
...that flows each month.

226
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:02,493
That jewel which defines a woman...

227
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:07,137
...what my mind needs,

228
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:10,330
...my body does not.

229
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:14,539
The blood in my heart turned
to stone long ago.

230
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:19,507
It is now a rock that never bleeds
however you hack at it.

231
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:24,246
Now I feel...

232
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:26,852
...my mind is not my body.

233
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:30,924
When we were in medical school together...

234
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:32,790
I had the desire.

235
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,190
Later I felt...

236
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:41,266
...maybe I don't want love or wedlock.

237
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:47,878
It was I who told Prasanna that.

238
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:51,606
I told him that again...

239
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,247
...when he became a monk.

240
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:10,334
What is it...

241
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:13,331
be frank...

242
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,611
May I sit beside you...

243
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,981
...not as a lover or a woman.

244
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:39,996
Just to sit with someone
who understands me,

245
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:42,956
...sees the true in me.

246
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:47,004
Prasanna...

247
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:49,803
I...

248
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:52,300
I feel... A lustful desire...

249
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,116
Do you know Srank...

250
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,581
I am a fallen woman...

251
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:05,781
my skin is dead.

252
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:09,454
This skin isn't even mine,

253
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:14,126
If touched I do not even feel it.

254
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:15,957
Touch...

255
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:19,633
that feeling melted away
thorough my fear.

256
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:22,969
Because, I know the reason

257
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:27,109
The blood that was spattered
on me in my childhood

258
00:32:27,578 --> 00:32:28,704
I began fading away

259
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,013
Before I becoming a nun...

260
00:32:34,552 --> 00:32:35,985
It was Prasanna who...

261
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:39,185
...insisted that I seek the
blessings of my father.

262
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,854
He accompanied me here for that reason...

263
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:48,526
Srank, if you can believe me...

264
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:51,400
...hear this too.

265
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:56,396
It was Prasanna who reminded
me of a word "father".

266
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:59,508
I had long since forgotten...

267
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,378
Yet...

268
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:15,782
You must trust me from now on.

269
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:20,193
That he is not harmed in any way
till you both reach Gaya.

270
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,861
I will make sure

271
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,796
This is Srank's word...

272
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:31,505
forgive me...

273
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,501
please forgive me for everything.

274
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:36,708
You should understand...

275
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,446
It's a craving that comes
from not being loved...

276
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:44,816
my trust in Moopan...

277
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:47,450
my belief in you.

278
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:53,427
Who's love should I love back.

279
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:08,071
You should not stay here anymore.

280
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,509
You should leave.

281
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:12,712
Tonight I will take the
monk away from here.

282
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:16,419
I do this instead of falling at your feet
and begging for forgiveness.

283
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:03,327
Srank... wake up,

284
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:07,234
There is some work on hand.
Quick, quick...

285
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:31,622
After fourteen years,
why did my daughter return?

286
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:34,358
Just to get the better of me?

287
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:36,291
I know...

288
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:40,528
...she will never agree to
the marriage I arranged.

289
00:35:41,405 --> 00:35:43,373
She will go back too...

290
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:46,202
without even looking at all
the wealth I have amassed.

291
00:35:47,111 --> 00:35:48,976
I know these for sure...

292
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,878
I cannot change them either.

293
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:58,181
But there are a few things I can do.

294
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,754
I do not see any difficulty
in doing them either.

295
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,827
My daughter let me down.

296
00:36:07,365 --> 00:36:09,356
And I have to bear with it and get on.

297
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,463
But, what if you let me down?

298
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:16,431
No matter...

299
00:36:16,774 --> 00:36:20,608
...because I have gotten back at you.

300
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:22,402
You just figure that...

301
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:25,048
without getting back at you,
I won't have a restful night

302
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:28,041
What you dumped in the
middle of the ocean today...

303
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:31,221
...was the one whom you
had given refuge to.

304
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:35,592
I had ordered them to
leave a little bit life in him.

305
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:38,762
Maybe he might have
felt like meditating...

306
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:41,090
...for one last time
under the sea...

307
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,430
What if he felt remorse for
messing with Moopan's life?

308
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:50,938
You need at least a bit
of life to do that, don 't you?

309
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,198
When you dumped him,

310
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,244
...what life was left in him
would have struggled...

311
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:56,943
...and tried to hold on to your arms...

312
00:36:57,648 --> 00:36:59,343
I am sure...

313
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:18,465
I could have ended my life too then.

314
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:23,802
But Prasanna had taught me...

315
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,506
...to seek the light...

316
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:35,351
...even when I am standing in darkness.

317
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:38,818
Philosophising to a
policeman is in vain.

318
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:40,490
Just tell us what happened then...

319
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:52,058
Throwing him half alive
into the ocean?

320
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:54,294
Is that Kutty Srank's protection?

321
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,938
You washed away with blood
even the little bit of woman...

322
00:37:58,075 --> 00:37:59,770
...that was left in Revamma.

323
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:02,708
There is no Revamma anymore...

324
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:05,814
Moopan killed Prasanna.

325
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:08,748
And you killed me.

326
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:12,279
No, not me...

327
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:14,685
I didn't know...

328
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:20,562
I didn't know what was in the sack...

329
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:24,497
...and that it was still alive.

330
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:31,003
I promise...

331
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:46,218
I have only one request.

332
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:51,686
Till the next ship sails to Madras.

333
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:55,557
Show me a place to hide.

334
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:59,399
A place that will not raise suspicion...

335
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:03,304
Somewhere I will not see blood...

336
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,603
If we catch that scoundrel Kutty Srank,

337
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:39,767
cut his guts out...

338
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:42,272
Kumara... Come on, all together

339
00:39:43,814 --> 00:39:45,406
Chathappa, you keep a
look out to the left...

340
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:46,846
Come on, all together

341
00:39:48,919 --> 00:39:52,116
Before dawn we should return with him.

342
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:11,899
Come in... Pemanna

343
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:28,689
Who's that?

344
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,194
Kanara... Go find out...

345
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:44,401
Good heavens... sir...

346
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,261
The ballad of Carl's man
(Charlemagne)...

347
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:13,964
This is our play today...

348
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:19,537
Of the twelve progeny
of emperor Carlsman,

349
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:23,874
the most handsome is Goyver Kunju...

350
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,943
My Kutty Srank...

351
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:49,468
Oh my autumn moon
my shining beauty

352
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:55,405
Oh my autumn moon
my shining beauty

353
00:41:55,646 --> 00:42:02,347
My precious girl
With a gem like heart,

354
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:10,424
My precious girl
With a gem like heart,

355
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:17,361
You noble hearted one
Oh the radiant one

356
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:23,404
You noble hearted one
Oh the radiant one

357
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:30,103
my kind hearted man
You own my heart my beloved

358
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,078
Sit down man.

359
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,217
hmm.. bridegroom

360
00:42:39,123 --> 00:42:45,528
Oh the very light of beauty,
very picture of love

361
00:42:46,163 --> 00:42:51,567
Oh the very light of beauty,
very picture of love

362
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:56,001
My flower... here the jewel
like city of Paris

363
00:42:56,106 --> 00:42:58,700
Look at it look at this city

364
00:42:58,842 --> 00:43:03,108
My flower... here the jewel
like city of Paris

365
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:06,341
Look at it look at this city

366
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:13,579
Oh the valiant one... my dearest...

367
00:43:14,158 --> 00:43:19,596
Oh the valiant one... my dearest...

368
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:27,569
Descendants of
Emperors My love.

369
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:39,208
I heard that a ship will sail
from Cochin after the rains.

370
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:40,715
The details are in this letter.

371
00:43:41,051 --> 00:43:42,882
We are on our way
to Chavakkad.

372
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,078
The others are in the boat.

373
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:45,745
We are already late...
I should go now...

374
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:48,588
Kutty Srank, wait up...

375
00:43:56,533 --> 00:43:58,592
It might stop the bleeding
from your nose.

376
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:00,394
try this medicine...

377
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,064
The bond between us
is through blood.

378
00:44:03,207 --> 00:44:04,333
Why lose that?

379
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:07,871
The smell of blood
has been there always.

380
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:10,075
It will not go away so easily...

381
00:44:10,781 --> 00:44:11,805
wonder if this medicine would work...

382
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:13,743
Let's try.

383
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,747
Why? Did you forget something?

384
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:20,247
The sight of you brings...

385
00:44:20,624 --> 00:44:22,956
my mother back to
mind for no reason...

386
00:44:27,464 --> 00:44:29,193
my mother whom
I have never seen.

387
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,766
Rehearsals started
six months back...

388
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:36,637
...for staging the play
at the church festival...

389
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:38,937
During the monsoon...

390
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:41,604
It is the same play again...

391
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:44,444
Only the players keep changing...

392
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:48,652
Hey... Panchi...

393
00:44:49,553 --> 00:44:51,646
Did maestro Loni say
anything about my role?

394
00:44:52,056 --> 00:44:53,853
Not yet... be patient

395
00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:01,256
Even though Carlsman
is the emperor,

396
00:45:01,665 --> 00:45:03,394
Roldan is the hero.

397
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:08,099
This time our play is going
to be centered on Roldan.

398
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:11,104
-Isn't it Sandhav going
to be Roldan again? -No..

399
00:45:12,142 --> 00:45:15,873
Let Sandhav play a
different role on this stage.

400
00:45:16,513 --> 00:45:18,105
...Sandhav is out...

401
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:19,874
A new Roldan is coming.

402
00:45:24,088 --> 00:45:25,555
Who is Roldan then?

403
00:45:25,923 --> 00:45:28,483
I would love to play
Roldan this time.

404
00:45:28,625 --> 00:45:31,219
Don't jump the gun Joppan

405
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:38,994
Joppan is out too...

406
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:43,032
Hey, Panchi...
we are at the berth...

407
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:44,329
You tie the line.

408
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:55,046
Maestro... your sister
is here with lunch.

409
00:45:57,488 --> 00:45:59,388
What's the big hurry...
move over...

410
00:45:59,523 --> 00:46:00,820
Let the boat come ashore.

411
00:46:06,196 --> 00:46:08,528
Hey maestro...
who is the new Roldan?

412
00:46:15,172 --> 00:46:16,833
Our Kutty Srank...

413
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:24,278
Let him shine...

414
00:46:28,652 --> 00:46:31,849
You up to it?

415
00:46:32,689 --> 00:46:33,951
I will do whatever
the maestro says,

416
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:35,216
...and why not?

417
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:37,392
You don't have to be modest...

418
00:46:37,661 --> 00:46:39,561
you will be spectacular.

419
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,765
Do we have the money
to stage the play.

420
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:44,530
We can't expect a dime
from the church.

421
00:46:45,335 --> 00:46:46,461
We will get nothing
from the church.

422
00:46:46,703 --> 00:46:48,694
We always stage it using
our own hard earned cash.

423
00:46:49,273 --> 00:46:51,366
That is why the play flunks
out every time we are on stage.

424
00:46:51,675 --> 00:46:53,905
We can't produce a play without coin.

425
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:55,475
Why don't you do it then...

426
00:46:55,746 --> 00:46:56,713
you have plenty of coin.

427
00:46:56,847 --> 00:46:58,314
I will spend like there
is no tomorrow if needed.

428
00:46:58,882 --> 00:47:01,544
But I have to get the role of Roldan.

429
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:05,545
Joppa... are you trying to be funny

430
00:47:06,223 --> 00:47:07,554
Why... can't I pull it off?

431
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:09,950
Huh...you can't even pull it off..

432
00:47:12,029 --> 00:47:15,556
when you do a dumb
spearman on stage.

433
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:19,295
You are playing a woman again...

434
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:22,198
Roldan's lover Angelica

435
00:47:22,372 --> 00:47:25,000
You might get my dog to play it,
if you are lucky.

436
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:26,632
Is Roldan grouching off?

437
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:28,368
Angelica... Here she is.

438
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:31,241
Dear Joppa... go home and
look in the mirror.

439
00:47:31,415 --> 00:47:34,816
How can you play Roldan...
with this dumb face of yours?

440
00:47:36,887 --> 00:47:38,320
Hey... you better call Joppan back.

441
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:41,988
None of the folks sitting here can be
a convincing woman on stage.

442
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:54,764
What if we have a woman on stage?

443
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:04,010
Oh why not?

444
00:48:04,114 --> 00:48:05,775
Will the sky come crashing down
if a woman gets up on stage?

445
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:07,440
Umm... maybe it will come down...

446
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:08,582
Enough... stop.

447
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:11,351
I am calling the shots here.
I have decided.

448
00:48:11,822 --> 00:48:14,950
My sister is going to
play Angelica this time.

449
00:48:30,974 --> 00:48:32,999
The troubles started then

450
00:48:37,481 --> 00:48:40,382
I met Joppan by the river today.

451
00:48:40,484 --> 00:48:43,180
Oh, then he must have enlightened
you of all the rumours then.

452
00:48:43,887 --> 00:48:45,354
Loni, why have you not thought of...

453
00:48:45,555 --> 00:48:48,991
getting your sister
married off for so long?

454
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:50,593
Don't beat around the bush...
say it straight

455
00:48:50,727 --> 00:48:52,217
What did Joppan tell you?

456
00:48:52,362 --> 00:48:54,262
-That he would marry Pemmana.
-Bhoo...

457
00:48:55,499 --> 00:48:56,796
Why? You don't like him either?

458
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,567
Don't you have anything
useful to do mother?

459
00:49:02,873 --> 00:49:05,501
You wicked man,
she is your only sister...

460
00:49:06,076 --> 00:49:08,374
You didn't even think twice about
sacrificing her into that play.

461
00:49:08,512 --> 00:49:10,878
Be warned...

462
00:49:11,048 --> 00:49:12,310
if you meddle in affairs
that don't concern you,

463
00:49:12,516 --> 00:49:13,448
I will cut up even
if you are my mother.

464
00:49:14,384 --> 00:49:15,749
She is your only sister...

465
00:49:50,954 --> 00:49:52,819
Why did you come here now...

466
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:55,818
Srank won't be pleased at all...

467
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:58,484
Oh hell! Its two days work.

468
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:12,438
You better forget
about that match Joppan..

469
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:14,439
Looks like it won't happen

470
00:50:14,544 --> 00:50:16,512
Do you not like me so much now?

471
00:50:17,614 --> 00:50:18,911
What can I say...

472
00:50:19,816 --> 00:50:21,511
It is the children who decide...

473
00:50:21,618 --> 00:50:23,176
I didn't come here for that.

474
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:26,422
That outsider Kutty Srank...

475
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:28,013
...is going to be Roldan in our play...

476
00:50:29,259 --> 00:50:30,487
I want that role...

477
00:50:31,261 --> 00:50:33,024
My mind got set on it...

478
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,764
But... what can I do about that?

479
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,497
It will happen if you try... Thatti

480
00:50:41,605 --> 00:50:42,970
You should... to Loni maestro...

481
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:45,305
No, that won't happen.

482
00:50:46,076 --> 00:50:48,044
If I stick my neck into his play...

483
00:50:48,612 --> 00:50:52,446
he won't even pause to
think I am his mother...

484
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:54,516
he will cut my head off.

485
00:51:01,792 --> 00:51:02,690
Father...

486
00:51:04,928 --> 00:51:06,020
Father Yonas...

487
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:09,032
Father Yonas..

488
00:51:11,535 --> 00:51:13,435
Did you hear anything
I just said... Father...

489
00:51:13,537 --> 00:51:15,767
I get it... I get both your problems...

490
00:51:15,872 --> 00:51:18,773
I am on it... you go along... go... go...

491
00:51:19,609 --> 00:51:21,770
I can't play Roldan,
Nor can I wed Pemmana

492
00:51:21,878 --> 00:51:23,436
..because of Kutty Srank, Father.

493
00:51:30,454 --> 00:51:33,218
Remember, he is an outsider who roams
around without religion or caste.

494
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:35,017
If we are not on the lookout,

495
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:37,821
That heathen will make off
with a nice Christian girl.

496
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,361
Don't say I didn't warn you.

497
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:41,689
Really, what is Kutty Srank's religion?

498
00:51:42,399 --> 00:51:44,299
I don't think
even God Almighty knows...

499
00:51:44,734 --> 00:51:46,964
The cross will be raised on Sunday...

500
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:48,833
Why don't you go and
check up on the preparations.

501
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,236
I am keeping track of all that...

502
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:52,035
What about my problem?

503
00:51:52,142 --> 00:51:54,303
-Are you coming to church with me?
-No.

504
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:02,881
Foreman, how is the
work coming along?

505
00:52:02,986 --> 00:52:05,284
Almost done Father...
come and see the cross...

506
00:52:05,388 --> 00:52:07,151
I am in a hurry now...
It is time for afternoon mass...

507
00:52:07,257 --> 00:52:08,155
I will be back in the evening.

508
00:52:08,258 --> 00:52:09,088
As you wish.

509
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:23,364
Oh, the radiant handsome one,
arriving in a ship

510
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:30,003
descendant of a Great one,
where are you from?

511
00:52:30,113 --> 00:52:36,746
He, the Lord of the
glorious France,

512
00:52:36,853 --> 00:52:42,155
Caralsman... the
Great Carlasman

513
00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:48,630
His very own sister's Son I am...

514
00:52:48,732 --> 00:52:55,433
My betrothed one,
my Uncle and my father

515
00:52:55,539 --> 00:53:03,742
the treacherous one
are watching closely...

516
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:07,806
your arrival under their gaze..

517
00:53:07,918 --> 00:53:09,146
Oh no...

518
00:53:09,586 --> 00:53:12,817
Roldan... why do you woo like a bull?

519
00:53:13,256 --> 00:53:14,484
Oh...

520
00:53:15,325 --> 00:53:19,022
The love should be there in
your song and your steps.

521
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:20,288
Maestro...

522
00:53:22,132 --> 00:53:23,099
How else could it be...

523
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,430
this deadbeat is even afraid to touch.

524
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:31,664
Maestro... look... Father Yonas.

525
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:36,212
Father... you should be really
forceful in speaking to them...

526
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:46,946
How is the play coming along?

527
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,422
Why don't you see
for yourself Father.

528
00:53:48,792 --> 00:53:51,955
Continue where you left off

529
00:53:54,264 --> 00:54:00,794
I have come only to see
your beautiful kohl lined eyes

530
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:06,137
have pity... respond to me...

531
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:12,807
Oh damsel, don't panic..

532
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:19,480
Upon your word I give up
panic and step on with you

533
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:32,263
in the outside world...
with tenderness and love

534
00:54:32,502 --> 00:54:37,530
Oh my gifted treasure...
my love inundated in total love

535
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:42,340
No fear comes near me
when you are by my side....

536
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:47,007
Oh my gifted treasure...
my love inundated in total love

537
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:51,486
No fear comes near me
when you are by my side....

538
00:54:51,588 --> 00:54:55,820
Oh my gifted treasure...
my love inundated in total love

539
00:54:55,925 --> 00:54:59,952
No fear comes near me
when you are by my side....

540
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:07,527
Oh my gifted treasure...
my love inundated in total love

541
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:08,399
Why...

542
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:12,270
Are you planning to stage
this on the church grounds?

543
00:55:16,246 --> 00:55:19,010
You seem like you have
some doubts Father...

544
00:55:23,186 --> 00:55:24,414
What is it?

545
00:55:26,523 --> 00:55:28,286
We should avoid women
from our play,

546
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:31,756
We are not so progressive yet.

547
00:55:32,195 --> 00:55:33,059
Then...

548
00:55:34,297 --> 00:55:35,594
Change him...

549
00:55:37,767 --> 00:55:40,065
Give it to Joppan...
that would be better.

550
00:55:43,306 --> 00:55:45,467
You would be better off saying
that in your next sermon...

551
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:47,070
That won't work here...

552
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:51,740
Remember, I am your
spiritual Father.

553
00:55:52,115 --> 00:55:56,017
If you go against my word...
Everyone will suffer.

554
00:56:00,256 --> 00:56:02,156
You are still a Christian, aren't you?

555
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:05,722
None of that has changed Father.

556
00:56:08,765 --> 00:56:10,528
You must come to church
tomorrow with your mother.

557
00:56:14,104 --> 00:56:15,071
That was great...

558
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:34,547
Oh my autumn moon...
my shining beauty

559
00:56:35,024 --> 00:56:40,985
Oh my autumn moon...
my shining beauty

560
00:56:41,097 --> 00:56:47,798
My precious girl
With a gem like heart,

561
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:55,276
My precious girl
With a gem like heart,

562
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:20,134
-Maestro... Hey you...
-Kutty Srank is calling you

563
00:57:21,971 --> 00:57:22,938
You go to hell

564
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,668
Let it be... Let it be...

565
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:42,856
Father...

566
00:57:44,093 --> 00:57:46,323
Why did you summon
us here Father?

567
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:49,790
Father, if we have done
something wrong..

568
00:57:49,899 --> 00:57:50,991
We will make amends.

569
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:54,998
What I want to know is
whether your son is ready for that?

570
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:56,670
Tell us what this is about Father.

571
00:57:57,307 --> 00:58:00,140
I heard you are going
astray from this church son...

572
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:04,076
Loni, nothing goes against
the church in this world...

573
00:58:04,247 --> 00:58:06,477
Even if you die,
you have to come here to be buried.

574
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:07,845
That is after I die, isn't it?

575
00:58:07,951 --> 00:58:10,181
See... Look at him talk back...

576
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:12,250
If he were but a seed
I could have put him on my lap.

577
00:58:12,555 --> 00:58:14,580
But this one is all grown up
into a tree... Father

578
00:58:15,692 --> 00:58:16,590
Father, you tell me...

579
00:58:16,693 --> 00:58:18,388
What tomfoolery did I do?

580
00:58:19,229 --> 00:58:21,459
Isn't it wrong to have your
unmarried sister act along

581
00:58:21,564 --> 00:58:23,259
side some guy in the play?

582
00:58:23,566 --> 00:58:25,864
Going against the pastor's
word, isn't that wrong?

583
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:29,138
Did you already forget
all the nasty things

584
00:58:29,572 --> 00:58:30,266
You said in front of everyone?

585
00:58:30,573 --> 00:58:33,133
But then, Father... I am a
performer and an artist.

586
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:36,406
You mean you are better
than the pastor... come on.

587
00:58:37,714 --> 00:58:41,309
I have told him certain things

588
00:58:41,751 --> 00:58:43,514
It's your job to make him comply.

589
00:58:44,153 --> 00:58:46,314
You will have to pay even
if it is he who does the wrong.

590
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:48,388
Don't say I did not warn you.

591
00:58:54,898 --> 00:58:55,592
You may go.

592
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:03,933
Why are you staring at?

593
00:59:05,108 --> 00:59:06,336
What is your name?

594
00:59:08,778 --> 00:59:09,904
Why, should I change it?

595
00:59:10,413 --> 00:59:12,973
-Perhaps..
-Not on your life..

596
00:59:31,434 --> 00:59:33,197
I had mentioned something
to your mother Pemmana.

597
00:59:33,303 --> 00:59:36,397
Joppan, you came here now knowing
that no one else would be home.

598
00:59:36,506 --> 00:59:38,201
No... no, in God's name no...

599
00:59:38,308 --> 00:59:40,435
Just to speak to you Pemmana...

600
00:59:41,344 --> 00:59:42,777
nothing else...

601
00:59:42,946 --> 00:59:45,506
To marry you...

602
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:48,179
Don't you have
anything better to do?

603
00:59:48,284 --> 00:59:51,583
You don't want me anymore
because of Kutty Srank, isn't it?

604
00:59:51,688 --> 00:59:52,985
Joppan, you better leave now

605
00:59:53,556 --> 00:59:55,251
No... I want the truth.

606
00:59:55,358 --> 00:59:56,848
Oh, this is such a nuisance...

607
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,985
-Beat it man...
-Pemmana...

608
00:59:59,162 --> 01:00:01,323
Look who is here?

609
01:00:04,968 --> 01:00:07,596
Joppan, why are you
waiting outside... go on in.

610
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:09,863
Looks like Pemmana
doesn't want me here

611
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:13,108
Don't worry about that... go on in

612
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:15,039
I am warning you...

613
01:00:15,144 --> 01:00:16,168
Even brother Loni won't like it.

614
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:17,371
Shut up girl..

615
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:19,448
The tail need not wag
when the head is here...

616
01:00:19,682 --> 01:00:20,910
I am leaving...

617
01:00:57,153 --> 01:00:58,313
Maestro...

618
01:00:59,022 --> 01:01:02,788
Maestro... that is your
dream girl's mansion

619
01:01:02,892 --> 01:01:05,986
Are all the old women asleep yet...

620
01:01:06,095 --> 01:01:07,995
Sister-in-law...

621
01:01:08,097 --> 01:01:09,860
So you are out to get
beaten up, aren't you?

622
01:01:09,966 --> 01:01:13,163
You go to hell...
beating up an artist..

623
01:01:13,269 --> 01:01:14,702
Have you even heard
of such a thing?

624
01:01:14,804 --> 01:01:18,035
Then you have to
prove you are an artist

625
01:01:18,941 --> 01:01:20,169
Hold this

626
01:01:22,478 --> 01:01:29,907
Someone eat a mystus fish

627
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:33,785
But the bone pricked my feet

628
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:37,792
Beloved sister-in-law

629
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:42,457
My beloved sister-in-law

630
01:01:43,232 --> 01:01:46,895
Not a fish but a mystus,

631
01:01:47,003 --> 01:01:50,564
Not a fish but a mystus,

632
01:01:50,673 --> 01:01:54,439
See the blood oozing

633
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:58,708
Beloved sister-in-law

634
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:02,112
My beloved sister-in-law

635
01:02:03,753 --> 01:02:07,450
It was not dead but alive

636
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:11,186
Not dead but alive

637
01:02:25,808 --> 01:02:28,174
Maestro.. here it comes..

638
01:02:29,011 --> 01:02:30,501
Here it goes..

639
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:52,166
Oh Father in heaven.

640
01:02:52,735 --> 01:02:55,169
Give my arms the strength
they need to sow...

641
01:02:55,471 --> 01:02:57,564
the seeds of faith all
around this world...

642
01:02:58,207 --> 01:02:59,902
...so that they may be the
symbols of your thy holy kingdom.

643
01:03:14,423 --> 01:03:15,447
-Father..
-W]hat is it?

644
01:03:15,558 --> 01:03:17,287
I will pull..
you must be tired Father..

645
01:03:22,732 --> 01:03:25,292
Joppa, Joppa.. pull..

646
01:03:25,401 --> 01:03:28,097
Pull Joppa...

647
01:03:28,337 --> 01:03:30,567
Pull Joppa...

648
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:35,175
Raise the cross

649
01:03:37,747 --> 01:03:40,181
Raise the cross

650
01:03:40,283 --> 01:03:41,580
Raise the cross

651
01:03:47,523 --> 01:03:52,085
Raise the cross

652
01:03:53,596 --> 01:03:56,224
Raise the cross

653
01:03:56,532 --> 01:03:58,625
Raise the cross

654
01:04:02,405 --> 01:04:04,032
Father.. Look Father..

655
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:09,508
Raise the cross

656
01:04:09,612 --> 01:04:13,571
Raise the cross

657
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:19,280
Raise the cross

658
01:04:20,456 --> 01:04:22,617
Oh no.. Jesus..

659
01:05:00,663 --> 01:05:02,153
Three dead

660
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:05,624
No one could come
to terms with it.

661
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:09,303
Kutty Srank vanished.

662
01:05:10,072 --> 01:05:13,098
Nobody knew where he had gone.

663
01:05:13,209 --> 01:05:14,699
Why did he abscond?

664
01:05:15,144 --> 01:05:16,839
Maybe because of his grief.

665
01:05:17,346 --> 01:05:18,643
I have no idea.

666
01:05:19,649 --> 01:05:22,140
The play stopped when
Kutty Srank left.

667
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:26,420
Not to mention myself.

668
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:47,766
That he left is for your
own good, sister Therutha.

669
01:05:49,011 --> 01:05:52,276
Your girl Pemmana is
nineteen now.

670
01:05:52,982 --> 01:05:54,745
It is an uncontrollable age.

671
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:57,942
You must get her
married off as soon as possible.

672
01:05:58,587 --> 01:05:59,986
As you say, Father.

673
01:06:00,856 --> 01:06:03,484
I have arranged
everything with Joppan.

674
01:06:03,726 --> 01:06:05,284
He is willing.

675
01:06:05,928 --> 01:06:08,954
It is just a matter of letting
the congregation know in church.

676
01:06:09,665 --> 01:06:11,428
Can you arrange the
wedding soon?

677
01:06:11,534 --> 01:06:14,697
But... you should speak a
word to Loni, Father.

678
01:06:15,204 --> 01:06:18,833
Sometimes he acts
as if he is raving mad.

679
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:23,410
What you said is correct.
Once I told him that...

680
01:06:23,512 --> 01:06:27,141
he should see a doctor
to get rid of his madness.

681
01:06:27,249 --> 01:06:29,342
He called me crazy then.

682
01:06:29,785 --> 01:06:30,945
How about that?

683
01:06:37,727 --> 01:06:40,560
Only God Almighty knows...

684
01:06:40,863 --> 01:06:44,765
The length to which I had
to go to get rid of Joppan's proposal.

685
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:49,434
In the end, during that rainy season...

686
01:06:49,739 --> 01:06:51,104
when it poured like the
tears from the virgin eyes...

687
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:11,952
Christ... Oh Srank..

688
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:14,962
Holy mother...

689
01:07:16,465 --> 01:07:18,228
What a sight...

690
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:29,741
Where do you show up
from... bastard

691
01:07:30,913 --> 01:07:33,074
I am sorry maestro...

692
01:07:33,783 --> 01:07:34,750
forgive me...

693
01:07:38,521 --> 01:07:41,285
Hey... our Roldan is here

694
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:43,082
Hey move that side

695
01:07:46,662 --> 01:07:48,755
We must bring the house
down with this play.

696
01:07:48,864 --> 01:07:52,095
Yes, yes bring the house
down with this play...

697
01:08:02,044 --> 01:08:08,540
If only I go against my word..

698
01:08:08,717 --> 01:08:13,950
oh my lovely treasure...

699
01:08:14,056 --> 01:08:21,553
you can order my beheading

700
01:08:21,664 --> 01:08:26,658
Oh my gifted treasure...
my love inundated in total love

701
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:31,468
No fear comes near me
when you are by my side....

702
01:08:31,574 --> 01:08:36,136
Oh my gifted treasure...
my love inundated in total love

703
01:08:36,245 --> 01:08:40,614
No fear comes near me
when you are by my side..

704
01:08:40,716 --> 01:08:46,154
Oh my gifted treasure...
my love inundated in total love

705
01:08:46,255 --> 01:08:48,223
-W]hat do you want?
-Kutty Srank is back.

706
01:08:48,324 --> 01:08:49,951
What more do you
want me do now?

707
01:08:50,059 --> 01:08:53,426
You must not change your word
On making Pemmana agree to it Father.

708
01:09:00,569 --> 01:09:03,060
-You come back later.
-Just see how he is staring at us

709
01:09:32,101 --> 01:09:33,932
Praised be the lord.

710
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:36,460
If you are done with
the rosary confess now..

711
01:09:42,044 --> 01:09:42,874
Right away..

712
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:46,948
I have gone against the
wishes of my mother and brother.

713
01:09:47,783 --> 01:09:50,752
I have avoided celebrating mass
with people whom I owe money to.

714
01:09:52,121 --> 01:09:53,019
Then..

715
01:09:53,789 --> 01:09:54,414
What then?

716
01:09:57,893 --> 01:09:59,121
I have lied..

717
01:09:59,228 --> 01:09:59,990
Is that all..

718
01:10:01,897 --> 01:10:03,455
I did a sinful act.

719
01:10:05,434 --> 01:10:06,458
Oh? With whom?

720
01:10:09,104 --> 01:10:10,196
Was it with a man?

721
01:10:10,306 --> 01:10:11,398
Oh no... that...

722
01:10:11,507 --> 01:10:13,202
Rid your mind of the sin... speak

723
01:10:14,777 --> 01:10:15,402
No

724
01:10:16,779 --> 01:10:18,076
The sinful act..

725
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:20,746
No, forget I said that

726
01:10:20,849 --> 01:10:23,477
Are you here to make a
mockery of divine absolution?

727
01:10:27,256 --> 01:10:29,247
Those who are not
willing to speak the truth..

728
01:10:29,358 --> 01:10:30,518
..must not come to
holy confessional

729
01:10:31,493 --> 01:10:33,051
No, I won't come again

730
01:10:43,772 --> 01:10:46,070
I know who jilted you.

731
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:48,267
The man whom you embraced
on stage and acted with.

732
01:10:48,377 --> 01:10:50,004
Him... that boatman.

733
01:10:50,312 --> 01:10:52,405
Look here.. Father don't say
such blasphemous things...

734
01:10:52,514 --> 01:10:54,004
I said it because you did it...

735
01:10:54,316 --> 01:10:57,479
Beware... of your sin and
go against our Lord's word...

736
01:10:57,586 --> 01:11:00,316
you will be excommunicated... be warned.

737
01:11:15,704 --> 01:11:18,673
I heard you said some things to a girl
who came here to confess.

738
01:11:22,378 --> 01:11:24,005
That concerns only us believers.

739
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:26,547
Who has it Father?... Faith?

740
01:11:26,649 --> 01:11:30,449
Do you think God? Almighty is sitting up
there watching us piss and crap?

741
01:11:32,821 --> 01:11:33,651
No...

742
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:40,929
This life is a naught Father...

743
01:11:41,230 --> 01:11:43,528
I too am destined to lie
in that box Father

744
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:44,462
That's all

745
01:11:46,168 --> 01:11:48,329
Shutting your eyes doesn't
make the sun go down..

746
01:11:52,441 --> 01:11:54,534
Father, don't try to
resurrect that corpse..

747
01:11:54,843 --> 01:11:56,140
Leave it alone.. let's bury it soon.

748
01:12:15,230 --> 01:12:17,858
Father, may the Lord be praised

749
01:12:19,768 --> 01:12:20,666
What wrong did I do to deserve this..

750
01:12:20,769 --> 01:12:22,464
You brought up your little
girl only to give her to the devil.

751
01:12:22,571 --> 01:12:23,731
Oh. Christ!

752
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:27,002
Your son is staging the
play in defiance of his pastor

753
01:12:27,109 --> 01:12:27,803
Don't you know?

754
01:12:29,712 --> 01:12:32,044
As for your daughter you
have let her loose to do as she may.

755
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:36,182
Do you know what she is
up to with that heathen...

756
01:12:36,485 --> 01:12:38,578
She walks off from
the confessional.

757
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:41,182
Do you know the punishment
for insulting our Lord?

758
01:12:41,824 --> 01:12:43,121
The sinners grave

759
01:12:43,292 --> 01:12:44,520
Jesus..

760
01:12:45,561 --> 01:12:47,654
This is your last warning..
remember..

761
01:12:52,768 --> 01:12:53,257
Joppa.. don't be so resentful
when paying our wages..

762
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:56,395
Those who don't want,
leave the cash and go..

763
01:12:56,505 --> 01:12:58,268
-Joppa..
-W]hat?

764
01:12:58,574 --> 01:12:59,472
You won't rest until..

765
01:12:59,575 --> 01:13:01,736
you see my family in a
sinners grave, won't you?

766
01:13:01,844 --> 01:13:02,902
That's right you imbecile...

767
01:13:03,011 --> 01:13:04,035
Oh god!

768
01:13:04,146 --> 01:13:06,171
You are a miserable corpse,
neither man nor woman.

769
01:13:06,281 --> 01:13:09,182
You will never ever
be a part of my play.

770
01:13:09,284 --> 01:13:12,048
Then that play will
never be staged.

771
01:13:12,154 --> 01:13:14,588
Run... flee you swine...

772
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:17,317
-See! What I will do to you?
-I'll see

773
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:22,186
Only Jesus knows
what will come of it next.

774
01:13:23,098 --> 01:13:26,727
My fear is that it will indeed
be the sinners grave for me.

775
01:13:26,835 --> 01:13:28,803
We can't be in fear like that mother.

776
01:13:28,971 --> 01:13:30,268
You calm down.

777
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:32,199
My child is sleeping.

778
01:13:32,307 --> 01:13:33,638
I must go now,

779
01:13:33,809 --> 01:13:36,300
but you be careful Pemmana.

780
01:14:01,904 --> 01:14:02,529
Maestro

781
01:14:04,339 --> 01:14:05,169
Maestro

782
01:14:05,874 --> 01:14:07,967
Get up..

783
01:14:08,811 --> 01:14:09,505
Maestro

784
01:14:11,013 --> 01:14:12,640
Day is up..

785
01:14:13,749 --> 01:14:14,579
Maestro..

786
01:14:15,818 --> 01:14:17,308
Where are they?

787
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:19,318
Maestro

788
01:14:21,356 --> 01:14:24,587
Open the door.

789
01:15:23,018 --> 01:15:26,317
You have lived in peace
for so long my children,

790
01:15:26,421 --> 01:15:27,581
Why do you fight now?

791
01:15:28,757 --> 01:15:31,521
Oh Jesus.. keep them safe.

792
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:34,594
Prayers are in vain this time Tathi..

793
01:15:34,830 --> 01:15:37,424
Blood will be spilled, I am certain..

794
01:15:41,737 --> 01:15:43,898
We will not be defeated for sure

795
01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:49,375
Oh my Lord..

796
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:52,708
Oh holy Mother..

797
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:55,847
Take care of us..

798
01:16:02,891 --> 01:16:04,722
Bring the food.. for rituals

799
01:16:09,998 --> 01:16:16,096
In the name of the Father,
the son and the holy ghost.. Amen

800
01:16:29,351 --> 01:16:30,716
The battle is tomorrow..

801
01:17:01,683 --> 01:17:03,708
Kutty Srank and maestro
should be careful

802
01:17:03,819 --> 01:17:06,447
Joppan's vendetta is with you

803
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:11,355
Joppan somehow knows
things that happen here between us

804
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:46,155
For a friendly feast Let's march

805
01:17:46,261 --> 01:17:49,287
March we will, to the Fort

806
01:17:49,398 --> 01:17:53,892
March we will, to the Fort

807
01:17:59,541 --> 01:18:11,476
Surround the valorous Parisians
Break their rank and order

808
01:18:11,653 --> 01:18:17,751
Break into their troops
Your imminent fall at our hands

809
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:24,230
Will cut you into
halves for sure

810
01:18:26,935 --> 01:18:38,176
As decreed by the
Emperor of the South

811
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:45,209
Will trap you in
our conspiracy

812
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:51,088
To avenge the dishonor
of our woman

813
01:18:54,396 --> 01:19:00,426
Soon the valorous
and the wealthy

814
01:19:00,535 --> 01:19:06,303
Have to face our swords

815
01:19:06,475 --> 01:19:11,606
In the war waged by us

816
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:18,481
We will hold our heads
high in the world

817
01:19:31,032 --> 01:19:36,060
Ever heard of a
Defeat for France

818
01:19:36,638 --> 01:19:42,736
Tall claim indeed "Win the Parisians"

819
01:19:43,278 --> 01:19:48,375
You Turkish army is

820
01:19:48,483 --> 01:19:54,422
Incapable of sustaining a day here

821
01:20:16,745 --> 01:20:21,944
Hey! You Olivier

822
01:20:22,050 --> 01:20:24,883
Will use you to
sharpen the spears

823
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:28,615
Writhing in pain
you will die

824
01:20:29,057 --> 01:20:34,085
Dying in pain
you will writhe in pain

825
01:20:34,229 --> 01:20:39,895
Where is your Roldon?

826
01:20:41,203 --> 01:20:46,368
Dare you say that
I am not around...

827
01:20:46,474 --> 01:20:47,202
you scoundrel!

828
01:20:47,642 --> 01:20:52,341
Where is your Assiri?

829
01:20:53,515 --> 01:21:04,483
Here I am in my full Armour,
pointing my Sword

830
01:21:17,772 --> 01:21:22,835
In this world, you Turks,
in this entire world

831
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:29,713
you will be torn to pieces

832
01:21:29,918 --> 01:21:33,012
just watch in this very battlefield

833
01:21:33,121 --> 01:21:35,146
pouncing upon you,

834
01:21:35,290 --> 01:21:42,025
I will cut you to pieces,
for sure

835
01:21:44,132 --> 01:21:45,759
Oh gosh! My leg..

836
01:21:46,001 --> 01:21:47,263
We have been betrayed

837
01:21:48,503 --> 01:21:51,734
-Maestro, everything is over
-Brother!

838
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:55,276
Oh maestro..

839
01:21:59,114 --> 01:22:02,345
Maestro...
Oh god!

840
01:22:02,517 --> 01:22:04,610
We have been betrayed

841
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:07,085
Maestro... oh no..
Dear brother..

842
01:22:07,188 --> 01:22:09,748
Holy Mother what am I seeing...

843
01:22:11,459 --> 01:22:14,155
Dear maestro...

844
01:22:14,262 --> 01:22:15,422
Dear maestro..

845
01:22:28,510 --> 01:22:31,001
You have stabbed our maestro
in the back, you swine...

846
01:22:31,112 --> 01:22:33,603
-You swine... I don't leave you...
-Leave me!

847
01:22:34,582 --> 01:22:38,348
I won't leave..
You..

848
01:22:39,054 --> 01:22:42,148
You... son of a swine...
I'll thrash you

849
01:22:42,457 --> 01:22:43,947
You swine go away

850
01:22:45,126 --> 01:22:46,559
Go... go... Let's go...

851
01:22:47,329 --> 01:22:49,320
Go fast
Fast

852
01:22:51,232 --> 01:22:55,862
Father... my son has left us...

853
01:22:56,371 --> 01:22:59,465
Oh Father...
I have no one now...

854
01:22:59,708 --> 01:23:01,403
My dear..

855
01:23:01,776 --> 01:23:04,677
-He left us all here and
has gone.. -Father..

856
01:23:06,448 --> 01:23:09,144
Father, he is gone.

857
01:23:10,585 --> 01:23:12,018
Father, he is gone

858
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:16,889
Virgin mother...
Look at my son's plight...

859
01:23:19,194 --> 01:23:22,061
And to the sinner,
turning to her Jesus said...

860
01:23:22,630 --> 01:23:23,995
What is it?

861
01:23:44,185 --> 01:23:47,279
It is said that maestro
Loni was poisoned...

862
01:23:49,457 --> 01:23:51,721
Someone did it to him...
I am sure...

863
01:23:52,027 --> 01:23:53,255
Who might that be?

864
01:23:59,567 --> 01:24:01,660
-Kutty Srank must be behind it.
-You are right.

865
01:24:01,770 --> 01:24:03,203
His past suggests that.

866
01:24:03,705 --> 01:24:05,332
No... He won't...

867
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:08,202
He loved brother Loni so much...

868
01:24:08,910 --> 01:24:10,878
Then who did it?

869
01:24:59,494 --> 01:25:02,395
Speak, if you know.

870
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:05,323
It was Joppan and Sandhav.

871
01:25:05,433 --> 01:25:06,331
Can you prove it?

872
01:25:08,236 --> 01:25:10,466
Why did they do it?

873
01:25:11,573 --> 01:25:12,471
Spite.

874
01:25:13,775 --> 01:25:16,209
Sandhav slashed Srank on the stage.

875
01:25:16,444 --> 01:25:17,069
That is not correct

876
01:25:17,178 --> 01:25:19,203
That didn't curb his venom.

877
01:25:21,316 --> 01:25:22,146
In the end...

878
01:25:24,152 --> 01:25:26,052
You haven't found
her yet, have you?

879
01:25:26,688 --> 01:25:27,450
No...

880
01:25:28,089 --> 01:25:30,114
There is no place left to search

881
01:25:30,225 --> 01:25:31,988
No, I cannot yield.

882
01:25:33,428 --> 01:25:36,591
Do you want me to point
this gun at my brother too?

883
01:25:37,832 --> 01:25:38,594
Go..

884
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:43,464
You have a month to bring her here.

885
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:46,607
Father..

886
01:25:47,108 --> 01:25:49,076
Our Joppan is dead

887
01:26:52,507 --> 01:26:55,965
Good sirs..
Come here.. quick

888
01:26:56,945 --> 01:26:57,775
Who is that?

889
01:27:10,291 --> 01:27:11,519
Is that your daughter?

890
01:27:12,894 --> 01:27:13,724
No..

891
01:27:14,429 --> 01:27:16,124
She was staying with me.

892
01:27:16,231 --> 01:27:18,199
Did she pass out on
seeing the dead body?

893
01:27:20,034 --> 01:27:21,524
She is pregnant..

894
01:27:26,608 --> 01:27:27,700
Take her inside..

895
01:27:27,809 --> 01:27:29,970
-You go and arrange for some tea...
-Ok sir!

896
01:27:32,547 --> 01:27:34,777
Did you recognize
Kutty Srank's body?

897
01:27:36,417 --> 01:27:37,782
Did she recognize it..?

898
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:41,914
She is a mute sir..
you have to gesture

899
01:27:42,023 --> 01:27:42,990
Ask her

900
01:27:44,759 --> 01:27:48,126
He wants to know if
the body is Kutty Srank's..

901
01:27:49,697 --> 01:27:50,789
What did she say?

902
01:27:51,699 --> 01:27:54,725
She said that it is not Kutty Srank

903
01:27:54,836 --> 01:27:56,133
How can it be?

904
01:27:56,437 --> 01:27:58,302
Both of these women
recognized it, didn't they?

905
01:27:58,406 --> 01:27:59,304
Yes

906
01:28:03,878 --> 01:28:05,038
What did she say?

907
01:28:05,613 --> 01:28:08,173
That she should at least
be able to recognize her man

908
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:09,181
Is that true?

909
01:28:09,484 --> 01:28:10,508
Yes sir

910
01:28:11,619 --> 01:28:14,179
His baby is growing in her

911
01:28:14,689 --> 01:28:16,520
She is four months along now

912
01:28:19,627 --> 01:28:27,124
Oh the moon faced one,
my radiant emerald,

913
01:28:27,235 --> 01:28:33,834
to see you Rushing I am...
my love, my beloved

914
01:28:41,015 --> 01:28:42,380
Why... why are you
milling around?

915
01:28:42,750 --> 01:28:43,978
Don't you have
something else to do?

916
01:28:45,887 --> 01:28:47,855
You don't like that
I am here?

917
01:28:50,024 --> 01:28:51,992
Why so cross with me?

918
01:28:55,430 --> 01:28:56,920
Do you hate me so much..

919
01:28:58,733 --> 01:29:01,293
That you refuse to
say even a word with love?

920
01:29:03,538 --> 01:29:05,563
You have something
on your mind..

921
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:07,103
Tell me..

922
01:29:11,813 --> 01:29:13,303
Tell me whatever it is..

923
01:29:18,419 --> 01:29:21,445
Remember, I had run away
from here last monsoon

924
01:29:22,957 --> 01:29:24,515
I landed on a different shore

925
01:29:25,493 --> 01:29:26,983
I was there for good

926
01:29:30,064 --> 01:29:33,500
She gave her life to me
believing that..

927
01:29:34,469 --> 01:29:35,834
I cannot push that away..

928
01:29:37,138 --> 01:29:38,901
I cannot betray her trust..

929
01:29:39,674 --> 01:29:41,301
I must return... Pemmana

930
01:29:43,544 --> 01:29:44,909
Another woman?

931
01:29:46,013 --> 01:29:46,980
A poor girl..

932
01:29:47,949 --> 01:29:49,109
a wordless being...

933
01:29:51,352 --> 01:29:54,446
So this is the mute girl
Kutty Srank spoke about

934
01:29:56,290 --> 01:30:00,750
It must be the alliance he
made after vanishing from Cochin

935
01:30:03,865 --> 01:30:04,957
Name?

936
01:30:07,268 --> 01:30:10,169
Listen..
We will ask the questions around here

937
01:30:11,939 --> 01:30:14,703
Paru, you take this girl
and go sit inside

938
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:21,446
When did Kutty Srank
skip out from Cochin...?

939
01:30:22,950 --> 01:30:24,440
During last year's rains

940
01:30:31,225 --> 01:30:33,625
Hey.. we have arrived, wake up

941
01:30:50,611 --> 01:30:52,169
Unnithan sir is here

942
01:31:02,857 --> 01:31:04,347
Oh wow.. isn't this Unnithan sir..

943
01:31:05,326 --> 01:31:07,817
Just the person I was looking for

944
01:31:12,733 --> 01:31:14,826
The flot is not seated right..

945
01:31:17,004 --> 01:31:18,437
Come on pull together

946
01:31:18,539 --> 01:31:20,166
We have to take it to the
other shore by three O'clock..

947
01:31:20,274 --> 01:31:21,104
Come on, faster..

948
01:31:23,411 --> 01:31:24,969
What are they trying to do?

949
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:28,048
This ferry is too small
for taking a flot across

950
01:31:28,549 --> 01:31:30,244
They take it across every year..

951
01:31:30,818 --> 01:31:32,945
This ferry will do
You mind your own business

952
01:31:36,324 --> 01:31:37,348
Imbecile!

953
01:31:37,792 --> 01:31:39,817
Why did she have to
come here at this time

954
01:31:40,595 --> 01:31:42,085
Something bad
will happen today

955
01:31:42,196 --> 01:31:43,959
Oh Goddess, protect us..

956
01:31:45,733 --> 01:31:47,166
Get lost you bad omen..

957
01:31:47,268 --> 01:31:48,633
Get out of my sight

958
01:31:48,736 --> 01:31:50,829
Stone her..
That godless woman

959
01:31:51,005 --> 01:31:51,903
Kill her..

960
01:31:52,740 --> 01:31:53,638
Run

961
01:31:55,009 --> 01:31:56,909
Go away

962
01:31:58,479 --> 01:32:00,242
Stop

963
01:32:06,254 --> 01:32:07,221
Fast... hurry up..

964
01:32:07,788 --> 01:32:08,812
We are already late

965
01:32:23,137 --> 01:32:24,104
Dead?

966
01:32:27,141 --> 01:32:28,506
Then how did it turn out?

967
01:32:31,612 --> 01:32:34,240
Kutty Srank saved everyone

968
01:32:56,737 --> 01:32:57,829
Kutty Srank, isn't it?

969
01:32:58,472 --> 01:33:00,372
-Yes
-Oh great Goddess..

970
01:33:00,741 --> 01:33:03,301
In the end it had to be you,
to save my life..

971
01:33:07,048 --> 01:33:09,812
It's her... that harbinger of evil..
She sunk this boat

972
01:33:10,184 --> 01:33:11,208
Damn her

973
01:33:12,853 --> 01:33:14,286
Isn't that her, Kali?

974
01:33:14,855 --> 01:33:16,152
She is still alive..

975
01:33:16,457 --> 01:33:18,618
You ought to have killed her and
sent her to the bottom of the lake

976
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:23,356
That was how Srank got a place
in Unnithan's house

977
01:33:27,068 --> 01:33:29,263
Bring it here... closer..

978
01:33:32,540 --> 01:33:35,509
It's him... he saved my life

979
01:33:36,010 --> 01:33:37,534
It is because he came here

980
01:33:38,446 --> 01:33:40,676
Speaking of which,
why did you come here?

981
01:33:40,781 --> 01:33:42,271
I forgot to ask that
in the commotion

982
01:33:42,383 --> 01:33:44,874
Oh.. just so.. just jumped
over here from Cochin..

983
01:33:44,986 --> 01:33:48,217
Come on, don't coming here
from Cochin for nothing..

984
01:33:48,723 --> 01:33:50,953
You disappeared from
here too ten years back..

985
01:33:51,392 --> 01:33:52,825
-Didn't you?
-Yes indeed..

986
01:33:53,127 --> 01:33:54,685
A spot of trouble

987
01:33:55,396 --> 01:33:58,559
Thought it was best to stay
away before it turned into storm..

988
01:33:59,333 --> 01:34:02,496
Why did you decide
to come here then? Well

989
01:34:03,070 --> 01:34:05,038
It is the Goddess herself
who brought you here

990
01:34:05,139 --> 01:34:08,734
You don't have to leave
from here... stay

991
01:34:09,110 --> 01:34:10,873
I too have a few boats

992
01:34:11,045 --> 01:34:12,478
You can drive one of them

993
01:34:15,583 --> 01:34:20,748
You and I gained at least
this much due to that bitch. Don't you agree?

994
01:34:21,656 --> 01:34:22,953
My dear D.Y.S.P. sir..

995
01:34:23,124 --> 01:34:25,285
Superintend Mathai... hear this too..

996
01:34:25,726 --> 01:34:26,818
Do you know how
many inexplicable,

997
01:34:26,927 --> 01:34:29,691
Dreadful deaths have happened
here since she was born..

998
01:34:30,331 --> 01:34:33,095
The flot that is usually sent
to the festival from our village,

999
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:34,224
Even that did not happen this year

1000
01:34:34,802 --> 01:34:36,827
Not that... it did not happen,
it did because of her

1001
01:34:36,937 --> 01:34:39,337
Why don't you finish her
off right now, Unnithan?

1002
01:34:39,573 --> 01:34:41,939
I am here to take care of
everything else, am I not?

1003
01:34:44,378 --> 01:34:47,074
It is not like the thought
did not cross..

1004
01:34:47,181 --> 01:34:48,273
Our minds back then,
superintend Mathai

1005
01:34:48,649 --> 01:34:50,617
Everyone is scared

1006
01:34:51,452 --> 01:34:53,886
Almighty Goddess, keep us safe..

1007
01:34:54,388 --> 01:34:56,413
Why do you fear sir..

1008
01:34:56,791 --> 01:34:58,019
I am not afraid

1009
01:34:59,260 --> 01:35:01,091
Why should I be?

1010
01:35:01,395 --> 01:35:04,296
I have collected all the
curses a man could get right..

1011
01:35:05,533 --> 01:35:06,431
At the moment of my birth..

1012
01:35:06,534 --> 01:35:09,594
My creation..
I don't even know who created me

1013
01:35:11,372 --> 01:35:12,930
It's just me and God

1014
01:35:14,709 --> 01:35:18,611
It has been a while since I have
been wishing for my own death

1015
01:35:22,450 --> 01:35:25,214
He won't consent to that either..

1016
01:35:27,388 --> 01:35:30,619
Now, if it is because of her,

1017
01:35:31,659 --> 01:35:32,626
Then so be it..

1018
01:35:34,795 --> 01:35:38,629
I will be back only after I bury her

1019
01:35:50,644 --> 01:35:55,547
Srank, you can stay in that
house on the north side..

1020
01:35:56,183 --> 01:36:00,142
Dad, dad.. forget that Dad..
Let him go

1021
01:36:00,454 --> 01:36:04,948
You haven't told Raghavan sir
about the bridge till now

1022
01:36:05,326 --> 01:36:09,626
Oh.. yes.. I forgot about it
while talking about that mute girl

1023
01:36:09,730 --> 01:36:11,857
This is the contract for the
bridge over Erinjappuzha

1024
01:36:12,700 --> 01:36:15,066
At least a couple of people
have bailed out on it before

1025
01:36:15,436 --> 01:36:17,461
None of them could get
the project started

1026
01:36:18,372 --> 01:36:23,674
Finally while the foundation
stone was laid, At least thirty people dies..

1027
01:36:24,245 --> 01:36:26,008
The project never taking off

1028
01:36:26,847 --> 01:36:28,678
There are always impediments

1029
01:36:29,049 --> 01:36:32,018
I wonder if it would take a
human sacrifice or something..

1030
01:36:33,454 --> 01:36:36,218
You do whatever you have to..
I am with you, aren't l..

1031
01:36:36,457 --> 01:36:37,549
What do you say Unnithan..

1032
01:36:37,725 --> 01:36:39,488
If you can't get someone for it,

1033
01:36:40,261 --> 01:36:42,786
I'll give you one..

1034
01:36:53,974 --> 01:36:57,205
Kali..

1035
01:36:59,313 --> 01:37:00,337
Open up..

1036
01:37:01,715 --> 01:37:02,682
Open the door.

1037
01:37:04,185 --> 01:37:07,086
Open this door...

1038
01:37:09,723 --> 01:37:11,691
You damned woman.. open, I say..

1039
01:37:12,126 --> 01:37:12,990
Open the door..

1040
01:37:19,366 --> 01:37:20,663
You won't, will you?

1041
01:37:31,045 --> 01:37:32,069
Open the door

1042
01:38:24,565 --> 01:38:26,192
The truth might be claimed..

1043
01:38:26,300 --> 01:38:28,393
and contested by both
sight and hearing

1044
01:38:29,036 --> 01:38:32,005
I had never seen her
until this morning

1045
01:38:32,239 --> 01:38:34,673
But I had heard a lot

1046
01:38:38,178 --> 01:38:41,341
Hey Kali.. open the door

1047
01:38:45,953 --> 01:38:50,253
I cam e here in the middle of the
night to tell you something..

1048
01:38:56,697 --> 01:38:57,994
Don't be afraid

1049
01:38:58,165 --> 01:38:59,462
You don't have to open

1050
01:39:00,434 --> 01:39:02,402
Hear what I want to say..

1051
01:39:03,304 --> 01:39:05,397
It was you..

1052
01:39:06,173 --> 01:39:09,336
You who made me the
captain of Unnithan's boat

1053
01:39:10,044 --> 01:39:11,671
Let others say what ever they like

1054
01:39:12,112 --> 01:39:13,477
It was you who..

1055
01:39:14,982 --> 01:39:16,108
Let me see..

1056
01:39:16,550 --> 01:39:18,245
Let me see that face

1057
01:39:18,352 --> 01:39:20,115
Just open the door..

1058
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:28,191
In this silent night..

1059
01:39:28,963 --> 01:39:31,796
You and I are alone..

1060
01:39:32,833 --> 01:39:37,395
You really know loneliness
only when you are alone

1061
01:40:28,689 --> 01:40:30,247
Why the special ceremony
now in short notice?

1062
01:40:33,494 --> 01:40:35,052
We had to have it soon

1063
01:40:36,897 --> 01:40:40,993
It has been ten years since
Vishnu got married

1064
01:40:43,303 --> 01:40:45,271
In that short span of time..

1065
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:48,770
How many untoward incidents
have happened in this house..

1066
01:40:50,544 --> 01:40:51,841
Untoward incidents..

1067
01:40:53,414 --> 01:40:54,381
Untimely deaths..

1068
01:40:55,416 --> 01:40:57,043
One after the other

1069
01:40:59,953 --> 01:41:02,717
My father fell first

1070
01:41:02,890 --> 01:41:06,451
We found him by the bed,
on the floor, one morning

1071
01:41:07,027 --> 01:41:08,051
It was a stroke

1072
01:41:11,298 --> 01:41:15,325
Vishnu, who I thought
would be a support to me..

1073
01:41:16,303 --> 01:41:17,793
Turned out to be a drunkard

1074
01:41:18,305 --> 01:41:20,170
We arranged his
marriage in a hurry..

1075
01:41:20,474 --> 01:41:22,499
To get him off the bottle

1076
01:41:25,279 --> 01:41:27,110
On the third day
after his wedding..

1077
01:41:28,882 --> 01:41:30,179
His mother died

1078
01:41:31,819 --> 01:41:34,253
Nobody knows till
now how she died

1079
01:41:35,956 --> 01:41:37,321
With that..

1080
01:41:38,292 --> 01:41:39,725
Vishnu started drinking even more

1081
01:41:49,436 --> 01:41:51,870
Tomorrow Vishnu is
setting off for Kashi.

1082
01:41:52,673 --> 01:41:54,698
To perform last rites for his
mother in the holy river Ganga.

1083
01:41:56,076 --> 01:41:58,101
Let her soul at least,
find some peace.

1084
01:41:59,580 --> 01:42:02,378
When the priest said on
the eve of his departure...

1085
01:42:02,516 --> 01:42:03,983
I agreed.

1086
01:42:05,552 --> 01:42:07,782
It might wipe off the negative
energies from the mishap with the float.

1087
01:42:09,690 --> 01:42:10,987
Where is the junior master then...?

1088
01:42:19,366 --> 01:42:20,264
Come here my daughter...

1089
01:42:22,736 --> 01:42:24,067
Do you recognise her...?

1090
01:42:24,771 --> 01:42:25,863
Junior master's...

1091
01:42:27,441 --> 01:42:31,207
Five years ago her family
had gone on a trip to Rishikesh.

1092
01:42:31,678 --> 01:42:34,841
Her father, mother,
sister and her children,

1093
01:42:34,948 --> 01:42:37,178
they all died in an accident.
Almost twenty were killed.

1094
01:42:37,784 --> 01:42:39,877
Fortunately she had stayed
back here at that time...

1095
01:42:40,587 --> 01:42:43,078
Now I am everything to her...

1096
01:42:44,258 --> 01:42:46,954
My child, she is always sad.

1097
01:42:47,427 --> 01:42:49,895
Then there is another thing
to forget her sorrow with...

1098
01:42:50,164 --> 01:42:52,223
Writing... writing stories.

1099
01:42:52,466 --> 01:42:55,299
Even now she is working
on a long novel.

1100
01:42:55,802 --> 01:42:57,895
She says it is the story
of these shores.

1101
01:42:58,105 --> 01:42:59,970
That damned girl Kali...

1102
01:43:00,240 --> 01:43:03,368
even she is in this story
as the dark Goddess.

1103
01:43:07,014 --> 01:43:09,039
-Oh Godess...
-Am I in the story too?

1104
01:43:16,256 --> 01:43:18,224
She is a torment to this land.

1105
01:43:18,759 --> 01:43:21,557
A snake that spit's malice and
damnation at all who cross her path.

1106
01:43:21,962 --> 01:43:23,088
But her...?

1107
01:43:23,697 --> 01:43:25,096
She moves away quietly
through lonesome roads...

1108
01:43:25,299 --> 01:43:27,426
avoiding the well worn
paths in the village...

1109
01:43:27,801 --> 01:43:31,703
... and the watchful
eyes of the villagers.

1110
01:43:32,206 --> 01:43:33,969
It's a shame that...

1111
01:43:34,975 --> 01:43:36,670
the venom doctor's
daughter does not know...

1112
01:43:36,843 --> 01:43:40,040
how to drain the poison
that has beset this land.

1113
01:43:43,650 --> 01:43:45,618
Where did you go during
yesterday's ceremony?

1114
01:43:45,819 --> 01:43:47,446
I saw master searching for you.

1115
01:43:48,755 --> 01:43:50,017
My father is mad...

1116
01:43:50,290 --> 01:43:52,451
prayers, sacrifices and the lot...

1117
01:43:52,759 --> 01:43:55,319
Father is the sole reason
for everything that is wrong.

1118
01:43:56,530 --> 01:43:59,499
He is the one who sold
everything bit by bit in this name...

1119
01:43:59,866 --> 01:44:01,925
We are full in debt now...

1120
01:44:03,470 --> 01:44:06,371
if only I could get the
contract for that bridge.

1121
01:44:06,707 --> 01:44:09,437
If getting it calls for a
human sacrifice so be it.

1122
01:44:10,877 --> 01:44:14,313
That is what I am going
to pray for while in Kashi...

1123
01:44:14,881 --> 01:44:16,974
to clinch the contract...

1124
01:44:17,951 --> 01:44:19,282
When will you get to Kashi?

1125
01:44:20,921 --> 01:44:22,684
It is a long trip, Kutty Srank.

1126
01:44:22,889 --> 01:44:24,823
You will reach when you get there...

1127
01:44:24,925 --> 01:44:26,051
that is all one can say.

1128
01:44:26,526 --> 01:44:28,187
Who will be able to
convince Unnithan sir...

1129
01:44:28,295 --> 01:44:31,093
that things are not the
way he thinks they are?

1130
01:44:31,365 --> 01:44:32,832
His craziness will be tempered...

1131
01:44:33,133 --> 01:44:34,361
if a good astrologer can convince him.

1132
01:44:37,237 --> 01:44:38,829
Where can one find...

1133
01:44:39,039 --> 01:44:41,166
a famous astrologer
like Kumbazhathachan.

1134
01:44:43,377 --> 01:44:45,504
Oh, Kumbazhathachan?
I can bring him here...

1135
01:44:46,413 --> 01:44:47,437
You mean the
Kumbazhathachan...

1136
01:44:47,714 --> 01:44:48,646
Why doubt?

1137
01:44:48,915 --> 01:44:50,177
I can bring
Kumbazhathachan right now...

1138
01:44:50,284 --> 01:44:52,684
and present him in
person to Unnithan sir.

1139
01:45:34,194 --> 01:45:36,355
Sinister beliefs
are not necessary...

1140
01:45:36,663 --> 01:45:38,631
to hear and tell
grim dark stories.

1141
01:45:39,199 --> 01:45:41,429
A dark mind will do.

1142
01:45:45,772 --> 01:45:47,637
Is loneliness a curse?

1143
01:45:48,141 --> 01:45:50,041
Or a blessing?

1144
01:45:51,812 --> 01:45:53,746
I am not sure...

1145
01:45:57,951 --> 01:45:59,009
Kali...

1146
01:45:59,486 --> 01:46:01,351
the lonesome heroine
in my story

1147
01:46:06,460 --> 01:46:07,893
Oh lord...!

1148
01:46:21,942 --> 01:46:23,773
How do the auspices
look for the present?

1149
01:46:24,010 --> 01:46:25,568
Don't panic Unnithan.

1150
01:46:26,012 --> 01:46:28,003
There is truth in the
astrologer's craft.

1151
01:46:28,181 --> 01:46:32,015
The augury might be
blocked for several reasons.

1152
01:46:32,219 --> 01:46:34,779
There are blind forces at work here.

1153
01:46:34,921 --> 01:46:37,788
The moon is powerless
and appear feminine.

1154
01:46:37,891 --> 01:46:39,153
A dark form.

1155
01:46:39,860 --> 01:46:42,226
I cannot describe
it to you any better.

1156
01:46:42,529 --> 01:46:44,087
If the dominant deity
is obstructed...

1157
01:46:44,197 --> 01:46:46,188
the directive is to not
take the auspices at all.

1158
01:46:51,538 --> 01:46:52,835
To that extent...

1159
01:46:53,006 --> 01:46:54,132
Darkness...

1160
01:46:54,908 --> 01:46:56,535
a musky darkness...

1161
01:46:57,277 --> 01:46:59,211
I see clearly the onset of that
darkness like a snake...

1162
01:46:59,379 --> 01:47:01,404
from the nether world.

1163
01:47:03,150 --> 01:47:06,142
A silent, all consuming shadow.

1164
01:47:06,820 --> 01:47:08,185
Silent...

1165
01:47:08,855 --> 01:47:10,413
speechless...

1166
01:47:11,525 --> 01:47:13,459
Aren't those the words
Kumbazhathachan used?

1167
01:47:13,660 --> 01:47:15,059
A darkness that...

1168
01:47:15,262 --> 01:47:16,820
darkness that is muse...

1169
01:47:17,130 --> 01:47:19,792
If there is something like that,

1170
01:47:20,066 --> 01:47:22,626
you have to rid this land of it
for you to sleep in peace again.

1171
01:47:41,054 --> 01:47:42,248
I wonder who made a play here?

1172
01:47:42,856 --> 01:47:46,519
Was it God or the
devil disguised as God?

1173
01:47:47,994 --> 01:47:49,723
Whoever it was
she is the one who lost.

1174
01:47:50,630 --> 01:47:51,597
it's her...

1175
01:47:52,265 --> 01:47:53,857
that poor wordless being

1176
01:47:55,635 --> 01:47:56,727
What is the matter...

1177
01:47:56,870 --> 01:47:59,498
You don't seem to have the same
happiness you had when we came.

1178
01:48:03,210 --> 01:48:06,145
Is that true... what you
said about a woman?

1179
01:48:06,746 --> 01:48:08,338
The scorpion has
it's poison in it's string.

1180
01:48:08,949 --> 01:48:10,507
The bee has it in it's head...

1181
01:48:11,051 --> 01:48:12,518
and the snake in it's teeth.

1182
01:48:12,986 --> 01:48:15,181
some vile people carry
it in every cell of their body.

1183
01:48:15,922 --> 01:48:18,015
One cannot set such people right.

1184
01:48:18,725 --> 01:48:21,193
Unnithan is one among them.

1185
01:48:26,766 --> 01:48:28,028
She is a simple being...

1186
01:48:28,602 --> 01:48:29,830
An innocent one.

1187
01:48:33,707 --> 01:48:35,402
A man's search
for his woman...

1188
01:48:35,909 --> 01:48:37,740
and a woman's search
for her man...

1189
01:48:38,011 --> 01:48:40,343
is the greatest of all pursuit's.

1190
01:48:41,615 --> 01:48:45,107
Kali has found her man.

1191
01:48:47,587 --> 01:48:50,420
Perhaps she suffered
prolonged loneliness...

1192
01:48:50,624 --> 01:48:53,354
and insults just so that...

1193
01:48:55,962 --> 01:48:58,021
this discovery can happen.

1194
01:49:02,369 --> 01:49:03,734
What about Kutty Srank...?

1195
01:49:04,037 --> 01:49:08,406
Is Kali the woman he has been
searching for all his life...?

1196
01:49:08,775 --> 01:49:09,742
I don't know...

1197
01:49:14,047 --> 01:49:16,481
Why did he come to this land?

1198
01:49:17,050 --> 01:49:18,483
Was it for Kali...?

1199
01:49:18,785 --> 01:49:20,412
Perhaps God knows...

1200
01:49:20,654 --> 01:49:22,212
Kutty Srank's God...

1201
01:49:24,391 --> 01:49:26,484
Love is never silent.

1202
01:49:26,993 --> 01:49:28,358
If it is in full bloom,

1203
01:49:28,595 --> 01:49:32,087
the women cannot remain
without speaking to her man.

1204
01:49:32,799 --> 01:49:36,530
When she is in such a state.

1205
01:49:36,770 --> 01:49:40,536
Her passion places
sounds on her tongue...

1206
01:49:42,576 --> 01:49:44,009
Kali may speak now.

1207
01:49:45,779 --> 01:49:47,007
But you came...

1208
01:49:48,048 --> 01:49:52,212
Just as I had dreamed
of all this while...

1209
01:49:53,186 --> 01:49:54,153
You came...

1210
01:55:46,406 --> 01:55:48,169
God made man...

1211
01:55:48,675 --> 01:55:52,111
and then said...
I can do better.

1212
01:55:52,745 --> 01:55:54,906
Then He made woman.

1213
01:56:12,231 --> 01:56:13,391
It has been a couple
of months, hasn't it?

1214
01:56:13,499 --> 01:56:14,625
Why did you come
back again?

1215
01:56:14,934 --> 01:56:16,959
You could have stayed
on with that rotting corpse...

1216
01:56:17,603 --> 01:56:19,628
You are not the old Srank now.

1217
01:56:21,541 --> 01:56:23,099
When you stayed with Kali...

1218
01:56:23,276 --> 01:56:25,972
I think she has send her
evil spirit's with you...

1219
01:56:26,412 --> 01:56:27,504
Be gone from my sight...

1220
01:56:27,880 --> 01:56:29,973
From now on you too are
a bad omen for me and this land.

1221
01:56:30,083 --> 01:56:31,107
Just like her.

1222
01:56:31,617 --> 01:56:32,584
You have to clear
out right now.

1223
01:56:32,752 --> 01:56:34,242
From this house...
and from this land.

1224
01:56:46,532 --> 01:56:48,762
Sir... there is a telegram

1225
01:57:00,480 --> 01:57:01,242
Daughter...

1226
01:57:02,281 --> 01:57:03,441
It's a telegram from Vishnu...

1227
01:57:03,750 --> 01:57:04,978
He is on his way back.

1228
01:57:05,351 --> 01:57:08,787
He is on board Monday's train
from Kashi to Madras.

1229
01:57:17,263 --> 01:57:18,355
News.

1230
01:57:18,731 --> 01:57:22,098
Varanasi Express, that departed
from Kashi on Monday...

1231
01:57:22,201 --> 01:57:23,634
headed for Madras...

1232
01:57:23,870 --> 01:57:27,499
... has derailed near Vijayavada
in Andhra Pradesh.

1233
01:57:28,341 --> 01:57:29,638
The accident affected...

1234
01:57:29,742 --> 01:57:33,508
the five crowded coaches
immediately behind the engine.

1235
01:57:34,013 --> 01:57:35,378
Latest reports indicate...

1236
01:57:35,481 --> 01:57:36,846
- at least fifty people have
lost their lives. -Dad..

1237
01:57:37,283 --> 01:57:40,047
-W]hat? -Over one hundred and fifty
injured have been moved to...

1238
01:57:40,153 --> 01:57:43,247
the government hospital in
nearby Vijayawada.

1239
01:57:45,625 --> 01:57:49,356
Ten women and eight children
are among the dead.

1240
01:57:50,129 --> 01:57:53,360
Railway police and other
rescue agencies...

1241
01:57:53,466 --> 01:57:54,831
have reached the site.

1242
01:57:55,601 --> 01:57:58,968
The rescue efforts are
hampered by heavy rain.

1243
01:58:11,951 --> 01:58:14,442
The train that Vishnu was on
has fallen into the river.

1244
01:58:14,687 --> 01:58:15,915
I heard it on the radio just now...

1245
01:58:16,756 --> 01:58:18,223
That curse is upon you...

1246
01:58:19,125 --> 01:58:20,217
as well and the remainder for me

1247
01:58:33,673 --> 01:58:37,370
The allure of the death entices me...

1248
01:58:39,212 --> 01:58:43,239
What if I were is in that
train as well...

1249
01:59:33,466 --> 01:59:37,300
it's not a silly game but l
have to redden my lips

1250
01:59:37,403 --> 01:59:40,497
Chewing on tender betel leaves...

1251
01:59:40,806 --> 01:59:44,173
I have to redden my lips...

1252
01:59:52,985 --> 01:59:54,350
Is little bird Neeli
meditating here?

1253
01:59:59,525 --> 02:00:00,549
Umm... what?

1254
02:00:01,127 --> 02:00:03,220
Please don't put me in
such a predicament...

1255
02:00:04,797 --> 02:00:06,355
Don't abandon me.

1256
02:00:07,800 --> 02:00:10,564
Let me tell you a way out.

1257
02:00:14,473 --> 02:00:16,236
All you need is someone
to marry you, isn't it?

1258
02:00:23,382 --> 02:00:24,747
Crying is of no use.

1259
02:00:25,451 --> 02:00:26,475
What is done is done.

1260
02:00:28,387 --> 02:00:31,618
Now the best we can do
is to avoid harm.

1261
02:00:33,859 --> 02:00:36,487
No... No...

1262
02:00:38,331 --> 02:00:39,958
I can't marry someone
like that.

1263
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:42,297
I'll be there

1264
02:00:49,475 --> 02:00:51,306
Any news of junior master?

1265
02:00:51,477 --> 02:00:52,739
Nothing yet.

1266
02:00:53,045 --> 02:00:54,535
Junior master will come...

1267
02:00:54,647 --> 02:00:55,739
Kali said so too...

1268
02:00:56,115 --> 02:00:57,275
Did she say that?

1269
02:00:57,717 --> 02:00:58,342
No...

1270
02:01:00,386 --> 02:01:02,149
but I heard her mind speaking.

1271
02:01:03,389 --> 02:01:05,016
Now I can hear that.

1272
02:01:05,925 --> 02:01:06,823
I am fortunate.

1273
02:01:09,262 --> 02:01:10,286
What do you have in your hand?

1274
02:01:11,130 --> 02:01:12,097
Holy powder.

1275
02:01:12,331 --> 02:01:14,094
Kali had pledged when
I had a snake bite...

1276
02:01:14,200 --> 02:01:14,962
An offering...

1277
02:01:15,334 --> 02:01:17,427
What is your religion and caste...?

1278
02:01:17,803 --> 02:01:18,701
Don't know.

1279
02:01:19,405 --> 02:01:21,703
The ones culpable for my birth
left without telling me that...

1280
02:01:22,275 --> 02:01:24,402
I never went after it either...

1281
02:01:26,045 --> 02:01:28,411
On some boat..
Or on a lagoon...

1282
02:01:28,581 --> 02:01:29,878
Or on some shore...

1283
02:01:30,449 --> 02:01:31,473
Whenever I please, I can go...

1284
02:01:31,584 --> 02:01:33,347
What about Kali?

1285
02:01:36,389 --> 02:01:39,415
You all are making up stories
and trying to get her killed.

1286
02:01:39,525 --> 02:01:40,822
Truth be told...

1287
02:01:41,460 --> 02:01:43,360
I am writing Kali's story.

1288
02:01:43,529 --> 02:01:45,292
I thought that the story was at it's end..

1289
02:01:45,398 --> 02:01:46,490
Kutty Srank showed up.

1290
02:01:46,799 --> 02:01:49,359
Now how should I end it?

1291
02:02:01,714 --> 02:02:02,681
Oh Lord...

1292
02:02:03,449 --> 02:02:06,350
for the first time
I am jealous of Kali.

1293
02:02:07,586 --> 02:02:10,020
Jealous of the love
she receives now,

1294
02:02:10,456 --> 02:02:11,548
the safety and
security she enjoys...

1295
02:02:12,124 --> 02:02:16,026
...and the warmth of a man's chest
that she can get now.

1296
02:02:18,864 --> 02:02:20,491
We can get the stuff here too...

1297
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:22,768
Who is up for it?

1298
02:02:23,202 --> 02:02:26,865
Bring it on... pour... Umm... more.

1299
02:02:31,377 --> 02:02:32,537
This is the real deal...

1300
02:02:33,713 --> 02:02:34,611
Drink up... drink up...

1301
02:02:37,383 --> 02:02:38,748
Is it the end of the story...

1302
02:02:40,519 --> 02:02:42,953
for me... and for her...

1303
02:02:44,190 --> 02:02:47,819
But one of the two
should be left behind.

1304
02:02:50,196 --> 02:02:51,424
The one who is writing

1305
02:02:52,665 --> 02:02:53,825
or the one who is
being written about...

1306
02:02:55,501 --> 02:02:59,665
who will it be?

1307
02:03:01,974 --> 02:03:04,534
A sacrifice to the goddess Kali.

1308
02:03:04,844 --> 02:03:06,607
No one should know...

1309
02:03:06,846 --> 02:03:08,279
It is a human sacrifice...

1310
02:03:20,192 --> 02:03:22,683
They decided to
sacrifice Kali one day

1311
02:03:22,795 --> 02:03:25,161
-W]ho?
-Unnithan and others

1312
02:03:25,798 --> 02:03:26,856
A human sacrifice...

1313
02:03:26,966 --> 02:03:29,400
Leave that to the police, Mr. Engineer.

1314
02:03:30,369 --> 02:03:31,529
It's coming

1315
02:03:32,104 --> 02:03:35,596
Have you brought the lamp?

1316
02:03:35,975 --> 02:03:39,001
Is the work going on?

1317
02:03:45,117 --> 02:03:47,142
It's getting late. Come

1318
02:03:47,253 --> 02:03:48,220
Come on

1319
02:03:54,126 --> 02:03:55,957
Stop there
Where are you running?

1320
02:03:56,729 --> 02:04:00,460
-Wait, I'll come
-Come

1321
02:04:04,970 --> 02:04:06,335
Take Kali away from here fast...

1322
02:04:06,439 --> 02:04:08,339
Go, go quickly

1323
02:04:08,441 --> 02:04:09,465
Or they will kill her.

1324
02:04:09,975 --> 02:04:11,067
Go... go now... hurry.

1325
02:04:12,978 --> 02:04:15,469
Kali, we have to leave immediately.
Or they will...

1326
02:04:15,581 --> 02:04:17,481
Moopan's henchmen are
here too... They are after me.

1327
02:04:18,651 --> 02:04:19,481
Come quickly.

1328
02:04:24,990 --> 02:04:26,958
Come quickly.

1329
02:04:29,562 --> 02:04:32,793
Pea nuts!

1330
02:04:55,387 --> 02:04:57,412
Thirty years as a woman.

1331
02:04:57,923 --> 02:04:59,550
An empty womb

1332
02:04:59,825 --> 02:05:01,315
and a pen that has
run out of ink.

1333
02:05:01,961 --> 02:05:05,124
It all it takes is a life for
the bridge to be built...

1334
02:05:05,631 --> 02:05:06,859
then here is my sacrifice...

1335
02:05:07,366 --> 02:05:08,390
my self sacrifice.

1336
02:05:14,974 --> 02:05:18,273
That night, Srank brought her
to my house on the island.

1337
02:05:18,644 --> 02:05:21,807
She lived there for a while
without anyone noticing.

1338
02:05:22,181 --> 02:05:25,878
One day he left saying that
he had a play to stage.

1339
02:05:26,185 --> 02:05:28,346
We did not hear from him after that.

1340
02:05:29,121 --> 02:05:30,588
But the good thing is that...

1341
02:05:31,023 --> 02:05:32,991
We were able to nab
Joppan's murderer.

1342
02:05:33,626 --> 02:05:36,527
Kutty Srank murdered Joppan...

1343
02:05:37,162 --> 02:05:39,187
...and then he vanished.

1344
02:05:39,632 --> 02:05:40,326
No.

1345
02:05:41,834 --> 02:05:43,324
I killed Joppan

1346
02:05:45,838 --> 02:05:47,396
They are all ganging
up to crucify me.

1347
02:05:48,107 --> 02:05:49,597
I have done nothing wrong.

1348
02:05:50,776 --> 02:05:51,936
Sit down Joppan

1349
02:05:59,785 --> 02:06:02,583
Won't you believe me Pemanna.

1350
02:06:03,222 --> 02:06:06,316
I said something to
maestro without meaning it.

1351
02:06:06,959 --> 02:06:08,187
Out of my rage that day...

1352
02:06:09,161 --> 02:06:10,788
I have done nothing wrong.

1353
02:06:13,899 --> 02:06:16,993
There will always be small
misunderstandings amongst friends.

1354
02:06:17,169 --> 02:06:18,067
That's all.

1355
02:06:19,438 --> 02:06:20,735
Forgive me...

1356
02:06:21,507 --> 02:06:22,599
You must forgive me.

1357
02:06:23,509 --> 02:06:25,943
I understand you Joppan

1358
02:06:26,312 --> 02:06:28,542
Holy mother at least
you said that much...

1359
02:06:28,647 --> 02:06:29,875
I am so relieved.

1360
02:06:37,690 --> 02:06:40,523
This drink was brewed
specially for those in the play.

1361
02:06:41,560 --> 02:06:43,050
Here is Joppan's share.

1362
02:06:53,572 --> 02:06:55,062
Joppan, you should be get going now...

1363
02:06:59,044 --> 02:07:00,011
Go on Joppan.

1364
02:07:02,414 --> 02:07:03,904
I shall come back later.

1365
02:07:32,511 --> 02:07:34,979
It is a matter of doing time
for at least fourteen years.

1366
02:07:35,080 --> 02:07:37,048
The dead Kutty Srank is
wanted in this case.

1367
02:07:37,149 --> 02:07:38,912
Why not let it be like
that for now sir?

1368
02:07:39,018 --> 02:07:39,985
I think so too sir...

1369
02:07:40,219 --> 02:07:41,447
Then... truth?

1370
02:07:42,021 --> 02:07:45,923
Oh, right Harishchadra's grandchild...

1371
02:07:49,228 --> 02:07:50,855
Do you have any proof for the murder?

1372
02:07:51,563 --> 02:07:54,862
The left over poison from what
I gave Joppan is still at my house.

1373
02:07:54,967 --> 02:07:56,059
A blatant lie

1374
02:08:00,305 --> 02:08:03,672
Well, that is all it would
take to throw you in jail.

1375
02:08:08,747 --> 02:08:11,511
Why do you try to save
someone who is already dead?

1376
02:08:21,427 --> 02:08:22,860
That is what I want.

1377
02:10:03,562 --> 02:10:06,326
Till the next ship to
Madras sails...

1378
02:10:07,266 --> 02:10:09,564
can you find a place
where I can hide and live...
