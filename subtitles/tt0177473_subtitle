1
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,359
Do You have the cream cross
shade in Max Factor lipstick?

2
00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:28,361
Yes.

3
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:37,370
Take.

4
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,377
''- Prem, what did You do!
- lt fell off from mY hands. ''

5
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,604
And You have also lost Your job.

6
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:51,408
A beautiful girl came to the
store and You went crazY.

7
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:53,409
Settle Your account and leave.

8
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:58,424
''l will settle the account, ... . ''

9
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:00,684
... but first let me start
mY account with that beautY...

10
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:02,294
... who has made me go crazY.

11
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:12,737
''Once, just once,
come into mY arms!''

12
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:33,744
MY bottle of liquor!
You broke mY bottle of liquor!

You idiot!
... . . lt's You?

00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:40,742
''Whenever You meet me,
You break mY bottle. ''

15
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:47,754
''Look, choose Your partner
to match Your dress. ''

16
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:51,761
The one who is chosen the best
pair will get the first prize.

17
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,842
''How can l, Romeo?
l am dressed as Laila . ''

18
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,442
There's Your Juliet.

19
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:10,282
''Preeti, You are left alone. ''

20
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:11,949
''Before dressing
up as Laila, ... ''

21
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:14,286
... . You should have given a
thought to who Your Majnu will be.

22
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,685
lf just thinking could
give one her Majnu ...

23
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,289
... everY girl would be Laila.

24
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:22,695
''Whenever mY Majnu comes, he
will cut through the breeze... ''

25
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,694
... . and land up
straight in mY heart!

26
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:32,702
- Who are You?
- Don't You recognise me?

27
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:37,741
- l am Your Majnu.
- But You are dressed as a Pathan.

28
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:41,344
''Don't go bY mY dress,
see mY heart. ''

29
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,750
''l maY not be dressed as Majnu,
but l have the heart of Majnu. ''

30
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:47,009
Don't You remember? You were mY
Laila in everY birth... .

31
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:48,752
''... and l, Your Majnu. ''

32
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:50,956
''And in everY birth,
You left mY side. ''

33
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:53,757
Promise me You will not
leave me in this birth.

34
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:58,753
What a strange man You are!
l don't even know You.

35
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:03,235
Wait... .

36
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,240

00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:37,292
''Promise You
will never leave me''

38
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:43,741
l am wherever You are

39
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:05,219
''Don't touch me,
take awaY Your hand''

40
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:11,635
''You are Young,
and so am l''

41
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:49,739
''Listen, mY love''

42
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:52,742
Just give me a smile and saY

43
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:57,338

Your lips is for me''

44

Your everY look is for me

WhY are You after me

49
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:04,215
''l am not the onlY Young
girl here, there are manY''

50
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:10,621
WhY are You following me

51
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:14,624
''l am not the onlY one here,

00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:26,671
''l am just like
all the others here''

54
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:31,242
''Promise You will
never leave me''

55
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:37,681
l am wherever You are

00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:03,606
''There are manY
Young girls''

57
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:09,203
''But no one as
beautiful as You are''

58
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,617
So what do l do

59
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:17,211
''You believe that
You will get me''

60
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:19,625
But l don't believe it

61
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:22,227
So what do l do

62
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:27,221
''Don't dream,
look at Your status''

63
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:32,670
''You'll have to be someone's
life partner, so be mine''

64
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:38,676
l am wherever You are

65
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:57,591
The prize for todaY's fancY
dress program goes to...

66
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:04,299
''... Mr. Preeti,

67
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:07,700
''... . and Mr. Prem,
who is dressed as a Pathan. ''

68
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:18,749
The second prize goes to
Mr. Anil and Mrs. Anil Nagrath.

69
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:35,765
You keep that too. l'll
keep this photo as a memento.

70
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:41,364
''Now quicklY give me Your name,
address, Your father's business... ''

71
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:43,405
... so that l can start
making arrangements.

72
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:49,812
''Please sit here, l'll consult
mY friends. Give me a second. ''

73
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,701
- Mr. Majnu!
- Tell me!

74
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,702
What can You do for me?

75
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:17,341
l can do anything for You.
l can give up mY life for You.

76
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:21,312
''Look, we are all students of
a medical college in BombaY. ''

77
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:24,750
We need a man for an experiment
tomorrow in the hospital here.

78
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:26,351
Can You come?

79
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:30,753
You want to rip open mY heart and
check if l'm a true lover or not?

80
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,358
l don't mind!

81
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:36,757
l don't mind even if l die.
Even Majnu didn't survive.

82
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:40,763
TodaY's experiment is
'freezing cold versus human bodY'.

83
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,368
lf the blood flow starts
freezing because of cold...

84
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:45,763
... . and the bodY heat
starts reducing...

85
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,805
... this condition is
verY riskY to human life.

86
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:51,376
One can even lose his life.

87
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:53,408
''l am losing mY life, doctor. ''

88
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:56,406
The victim should
not be allowed to sleep.

89
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:59,413
Because that sleep
will be the sleep of death.

90
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,705
''Preeti, what treatment will
You give in such a situation?''

91
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:25,673
Coroman and Sietimen
injections should be given.

92
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:26,710
And glucose saline.

93
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,748
Check whether You have
those medicines or not.

94
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:31,747
Or l'll be dead!

95
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:34,352
''Don't worrY,
You are among doctors. ''

96
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:37,756
That's what l fear. You must
have heard the famous saYing...

97
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:43,759
lf the medicines are not
available... .

98
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:46,364
... . brandY and hot water bottles
can be used to generate bodY heat.

99
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:49,365
What if one doesn't
have even that?

100
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:51,768
lntelligent question.

101
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,805
''lf You don't have anY of this,
bodY heat is also a therapY. ''

102
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,804
''- BodY heat?
- Yes, bodY heat. ''

103
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,809
The victim should be
held close... .

104
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,277
... . so as to transfer
Your bodY heat to his bodY.

105
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:06,674
This is one last therapY with
which the patient can be saved.

106
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:11,278
''- Like this... ... .
- WhY do You bother, sir?''

107
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:14,693
''lf You do everything,
when will Yours students learn?''

108
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,295
Give them a chance.

109
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:23,301
This is enough for todaY.
We'll continue tomorrow.

110
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:25,704
You maY leave. Collect Your
paYment from the cashier.

111
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:33,711
Excuse me.
What time do l come tomorrow?

112
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,349
Whenever You feel like. You
will be kept in cold storage now.

113
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:39,751
So that You get
frozen like a chicken.

114
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:43,753
Freeze me like chicken
or ice-cream.

115
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:45,356
But don't chill
our relationship.

116
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:53,356
Go and tell Preeti
Your father is here.

117
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,357
- MY father?
- Her father!

118
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:09,281
- Sign here.
- What's the hurrY?

119
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:11,681
The experiment did not
get over todaY.

120
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:13,284
l'll have to
come tomorrow too.

121
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:15,876
l think l will have
to come everY daY now.

122
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:17,687
Has the doctor
appointed You permanentlY?

123
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:19,689
You don't understand.

124
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:23,693
Dr. Preeti has fallen for me.

125
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,491
So she calls me here on
some or the other pretext.

126
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:31,702
Love is like that.
Makes one go crazY.

127
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,303
Who is it?

128
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:39,310
- Since when do You know Preeti?
- Since manY births.

129
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:43,339
And what made You feel
that Preeti loves You?

130
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:49,343
What made You feel l'll discuss
mY private matters with You?

131
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:55,349
''- Are You her father?
- Yes, l am her father. ''

132
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,362
What!!

133
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:08,671
Good l met You too.

134
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:11,674
''So, what do You think of me?''

135
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,677
Will You make
me Your son-in-law?

136
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:18,680
l'll have You arrested!

137
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:20,685
What??

138
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:25,688
HeY! A fire somewhere?

139
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:27,690
''This time, the fire is
burning not here, but over there. ''

140
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,699
What happened?
WhY are You angrY?

141
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:40,305
Who was that guY? He was
talking nonsense about You.

142
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,297
''He's crazY, forget about him. ''

143
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,300
- How come You are here?
- l've received Amar's telegram.

144
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:47,340
He is going abroad. We have to
leave for BombaY todaY itself.

145
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,340
''But daddY,
l haven't even shopped Yet. ''

146
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,752
Finish Your shopping and come to
the hotel. l'll wait there.

147
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,242
- You've come again?
- Yes.

148
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:21,646
l came to ask if You'll continue
the bodY heat experiment tomorrow?

149
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,680
OnlY if You have Your bodY left.

150
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:28,286
The waY You've latched on to the
jeep on this dangerous road...

151
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,421
... You will fall in the
ditch bY the next turning...

152
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:31,682
... and break Your bones.

153
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,691
l was born with skates on.

154
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,694
And l'll die with
skates on mY feet.

155
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:51,742
''Whatever You maY saY, but even
God wants us to get together. ''

156
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:56,339
- Give Your consent to marriage.
- Never!

157
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:58,748
But l've alreadY
spoken to Your dad.

158
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:01,616
What did he saY?

159
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:06,623
What would he saY?
He felt shY hearing the proposal.

160
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:09,626
And couldn't saY a word.
Now You onlY saY something.

161
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:12,628
''You like me, don't You?''

162
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:18,636
- No?... . Just this much?
- No.

163
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:20,237
- Just this much?
- Damn!

164
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:21,638
This much?

165
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:35,684
- Are You hurt?
- Not much.

166
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:38,289
Let me check what's wrong.

167
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:42,293
Oh mY God!
The radiator is smashed.

168
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,286
What now?

169
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:48,299
''Nothing much,
onlY the jeep won't run. ''

170
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,292
l have an idea.

171
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:54,297
''l'll staY in the jeep,
You go and call some mechanic. ''

172
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:57,740
''Madam, You don't get
mechanics in such places. ''

173
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:01,608
l have a car that
runs without petrol.

174
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,613
Consider me a car
and come into mY arms.

175
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:10,210
''Look Mr. Prem, if You reallY want
to help me, give me Your skates. ''

176
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,621
And l will go home walking?

177
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:16,227
No... . no. There has
been a heavY snowfall.

178
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:18,220
And roller skating on
such roads is not easY.

179
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:20,227
lt will be better if
You come into mY arms.

180
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:21,366
Never!

181
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,828
lf You think You can take
advantage of mY helplessness...

182
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:27,670
... You are mistaken.
l can walk it out.

183
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:29,239
Understand?

184
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:32,643
l understand.
Go. No one is stopping You.

185
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:03,603
''We probablY knew each
other before this life''

186
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:07,610
''You don't just like
a person for no reason''

187
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:22,218
''Whether You are
aware of it or not''

188
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:31,225
Whether You believe it or not

189
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:35,355
Those times seem foggY'

190
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:39,768
''Here, there, wonder where''

191
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:53,407
''You and me had met
somewhere before''

192
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:57,413
''When l saw You,
mY heart said''

193
00:20:57,856 --> 00:21:03,294
''Whether You are
aware of it or not''

194
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:11,701
Whether You believe it or not

195
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:28,353
Come.

196
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:35,360
Alright.
But onlY because l am helpless.

197
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:39,355
''Alright, but it's a
wonderful helplessness. ''

198
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:45,370
''Look, don't get lost now''

199
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:50,374
''Don't ever get
separated from me''

200
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:03,285
We will staY united this time

201
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:07,681
''This is a
promise we make todaY''

202
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:13,697
''Whether You are
aware of it or not''

203
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:22,740
Whether You believe it or not

204
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:20,298
Help!!

205
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:11,271
Where did You pick her up from?

206
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:13,484
Go and get a doctor quicklY!

207
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:15,276
This girl is falling
unconscious with cold.

208
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:20,680
So she is the same girl who's
address You alwaYs wanted to know.

209
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:23,292
You managed to trap her so soon?

210
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:25,286
''Stop Your nonsense Jaggi,
and go quicklY!''

211
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,698
Do You think l am mad?

212
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:30,700
How can l go out in this cold
weather without mY liquor?

213
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:35,739
''l need to warm up,
give me some moneY for liquor. ''

214
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:40,743
''Alright, take this. But remember,
first go to the doctor, then drink. ''

215
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:42,312
''- First drink, then doctor.
- What?''

216
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:44,339
''No, first doctor, then drink. ''

217
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:53,346
''But friend,
this girl is verY beautiful. ''

218
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:55,355
''Do one thing.
You go to the doctor, ... ''

219
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:57,085
... . l'll trY some
home remedY till then.

220
00:24:57,395 --> 00:24:58,760
Jaggi... . go!

221
00:24:59,397 --> 00:25:03,629
l'm going. You onlY
trY out the home remedY.

222
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:08,639
Remove Your clothes
and wear the blanket.

223
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:11,241
You'll feel more
cold in wet clothes.

224
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:13,276
''Preeti, don't refuse. ''

225
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:19,684
l'll have to do it.

226
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:28,292
l'll have to do it.

227
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:55,312
''Preeti, don't sleep!''

228
00:26:58,383 --> 00:27:01,614
Don't sleep.
lt will be the sleep of death!

229
00:27:02,253 --> 00:27:03,220
Wake up!

230
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:30,281
'''lf nothing is available,
bodY heat is also a therapY'''

231
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:32,283
BodY heat.

232
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,683
'The patient should be
held close... .

233
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:37,287

234

'This is one last remedY

Please don't misunderstand me.

239
00:28:58,336 --> 00:29:00,236
l didn't take
advantage of the situation.

240
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,605
l tried everything
l could to revive You.

241
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:10,203
But l didn't succeed. Then l
remembered the doctor's words.

242
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:11,615
And l... .

243
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:15,219

''The mistake l made
in that situation, ... ''

245

... You can give me whatever
punishment You deem fit for it.

ls one punished
for saving a life?

00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:35,672
''lf l was in Your place,
even l'd do just that. ''

248
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:43,670
Then what has happened
coincidentallY... .

249
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:51,687
''l mean, You and me... . .

No... ...

251
00:29:57,729 --> 00:29:59,697
- Nothing.
- What nothing?

252
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:05,700
''ActuallY,
l am verY poor, Preeti. ''

253
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:10,307
l don't have anything but love.

254
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:13,742
What else does one
need other than love?

255
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:19,350
MY house is verY small.

256
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:21,745
People are happY
in small houses too.

257
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:28,348
MY mother desires to
have a daughter-in-law.

258
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:31,362
l lost mY mother
when l was Young.

259
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:34,365
l never knew what
a mother's love was.

260
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:40,803
You mean You are giving consent?

261
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:49,811
Now You'll see! l'll work
hard and buY a nice house.

262
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:53,816
''ln which, mom, son,
daughter-in-law & he will live. ''

263
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:56,818
- Who he?
- He!

264
00:30:57,455 --> 00:30:59,753
Nice and beautiful
like his mother.

265
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,689
And a skating champion
like his father.

266
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:04,693
Enough!
You are going too far ahead.

267
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:08,695
Even mY father's consent is
necessarY along with mine.

268
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:15,295
''lf l refuse,
won't You blackmail me... ''

269
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,738
... bY threatening to
tarnish mY daughter's image?

270
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,537
''No, that situation
will not arise. ''

271
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,347
Because even Preeti loves me.

272
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:26,745
Wrong! MY daughter cannot
love a ruffian like You.

273
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:31,754
''Don't dream of marriage, mister.
This marriage cannot take place!''

274
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:36,759
Don't forget that Your daughter
can marrY me without Your consent.

275
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:42,765
''ln such a situation, she will
get nothing from mY propertY. ''

276
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:48,361
''Don't worrY, before marrYing
Preeti, l'll set one condition. ''

277
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,375
That she leaves Your home with
onlY the clothes on her bodY.

278
00:31:56,447 --> 00:31:57,414
Wait!

279
00:31:58,449 --> 00:32:01,680
''Don't worrY, l am not
going to blackmail You. ''

280
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,687
l am going to wait for Your
daughter at the reception.

281
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:09,691
So that You can hear
her decision from her.

282
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:15,299
''As a doctor, l wouldn't call it
a wrong doing, but treatment. ''

283
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:18,700
lt is good that he
wants to marrY You.

284
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:22,305
Even You have accepted.
But will Your father agree?

285
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,345
''Prem, l have been looking
for You since so long. ''

286
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:39,351
The doctor has called You. Your
mother's condition is serious.

287
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,755
- Mother? - Yes.
- Let's go.

288
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,352
Wait a minute.

289
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:55,361
''Preeti, Your father doesn't like
me. He's turned down mY proposal. ''

290
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:59,808
MY mother is not feeling well.
l am going to see her.

291
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:01,675
l'll come and meet You
the moment l am back.

292
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:05,274
Give this letter to Ms. Preeti.

293
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:49,360
''When l came here,
she was doing the house chores. ''

294
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:54,354
''A heart patient needs
complete rest, not exertion. ''

295
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:58,758
l'd told You before that
mY friend has a sanatorium.

296
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:00,631
WhY don't You keep her there?

297
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:02,237
''Yes, doctor. ''

298
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:06,241
''Did You hear that, mom?''

299
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:10,670
lf You ever do the
house chores again... .

300
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:13,681
Then who else will do them?
You?

301
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:18,277
l have told You so manY times
that either the mother... .

302
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:20,686
... or the daughter-in-law
does the house chores.

303
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,284
So l'll get You
a daughter-in-law.

304
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:25,295
Shall l?

305
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:28,298
Shall l?

306
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:32,302
Are You joking or have
You reallY chosen someone?

307
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:35,304
l have.

308
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:41,744
'Whatever l did with You
was just for moneY. '

309
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,312
MoneY?

310
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:50,345
'''Because nowadaYs, moneY is
more important than love. '''

311
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:58,352
'So tell Your father to give
me Rs. 500000 in marriage. '

312
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:04,233
'You can consider this
blackmail or need. '

313
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:06,634
'l'll come back after
meeting mY mother. '

Learn to differentiate between
a piece of glass and diamond.

On one hand is this
greedY Youth... .

''BoY, pack our bags!''

321
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:29,688
Listen.
Won't You answer that letter?

322
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:33,297
''No, l don't want to keep
anY relationship with him!''

323

OnlY writing a replY will
break the relationship.

Or it is possible he maY
come following You to BombaY.

''- Preeti, You are leaving?
- Yes. ''

327

Didn't You get mY letter?

''DaddY, let's go. ''

331

00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,312
'... You have disgraced mY
honour when l was unconscious'

335
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:59,747
'Don't ever trY
to meet me again'

336
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:01,615
What will l tell mom now?

337
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:04,619
l'll have to lie to her.

338
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:05,822
Brother has arrived!

339
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:09,217
Do You intend to send
Your duplicate for marriage?

340
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:24,674
l apologise for coming late.

341
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:29,245
''l first thought of
informing over the phone, ... ''

342
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:31,272
... then changed mY mind.

343
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:34,284
''l thought, what is the harm in
saYing it in everYone's presence. ''

344
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:39,278
''Ladies and gentlemen,
l regret to saY... . . ''

345
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:42,690
... that this engagement
will not take place.

346
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:54,296
''Yes, this engagement
will not take place. ''

347
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:55,504
''What are You saYing, brother!''

348
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:58,298
''Hirachand, hadn't You fixed
the alliance with him?''

349
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:06,879
''Amar, before saYing
such a thing, ... ''

350
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:09,219
... You should have given
a thought to our honour.

351
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:13,219
Ask Your daughter whY she didn't
give a thought to mY honour.

352
00:38:14,258 --> 00:38:16,624
''The truth was hidden from me,
l was kept in the dark. ''

353
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:18,228
''Right, Preeti?''

354
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:21,629
''Amar, just a minute. ''

355
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:30,240
''Amar, l never wished to hide
anything about me from You. ''

356
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,243
l know You have a
complain against me.

357
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:35,645
But You could have
told me that in private.

358
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,679
ln the presence of
so manY guests... .

359
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:40,679
No! Whatever l saY will
be in everYone's presence.

360
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:47,690
''Friends, this girl
has shattered mY poor heart. ''

361
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,294
She broke the
promise she gave me.

362
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,297
''Before leaving for Shimla,
she had promised me... . ''

363
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:54,896
... . that she'll marrY me
as soon as she returns.

364
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:58,894
''But now, these people are
getting me engaged to her... ''

365
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:00,564
... . and sending me
alone for mY studies abroad.

366
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:08,177
''MY beloved will be awaY
from me, awaY from mY sight. ''

367
00:39:09,246 --> 00:39:11,214
What if she falls in love
with someone else here?

368
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:15,619
Even You can fall in
love with someone else.

369
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:18,219
Ofcourse l can.

370
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:20,617
''That is whY l am telling You,
no engagement, direct marriage. ''

371
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:21,825
And we'll flY together.

372
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,628
''Look Amar, onlY one
job can be done at one time. ''

373
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:26,627
You are going there to studY.

374
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:28,889
''lf l come along, You
won't be able to studY. ''

375
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:32,235
What if instead of coming back
as a heart specialist... .

376
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:33,836
... l return as a heart patient?

377
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:36,239
''Then don't worrY,
l'll cure You. ''

378
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:40,675
''Uncle, please explain to her.
l am verY intelligent. ''

379
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:42,472
l can do manY things at a time.

380
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:44,246
Uncle!

381
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:47,684
''Priest, You onlY find some waY. ''

382
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:51,686
SaY that if this
auspicious moment passes...

383
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:55,690
... . this marriage
will never take place.

384
00:39:55,826 --> 00:39:58,693
''No son, You should not saY
such inauspicious things. ''

385
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,695
''Preeti, come here. ''

386
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:03,300
''Priest, perform
the engagement ritual. ''

387
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:17,339
Exchange these rings.

388
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:18,739
''What happened, Preeti?''

389
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:23,338
l knew Preeti would not
be able to see me leave.

390
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:26,747
Didn't l alwaYs saY that
the heart is verY delicate?

391
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:30,353
Whether of a man or woman.
l won't go if You so wish.

392
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:37,352
''Don't saY that, Amar.
l am fine. ''

393
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:40,355
- Sure?
- Yes.

394
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:41,765
''OkaY uncle, bYe. ''

395
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:06,688
Then You find some solution
that will save Your honour... .

396
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:08,689
... and also mY babY.

397
00:42:17,334 --> 00:42:22,294
''l have a friend in
Khandala, Dr. Sudhin Majumdar. ''

398
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,308
He has a nursing home there.

399
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,311
Go and live there
until You deliver the babY.

400
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,349
- And after the deliverY?
- We'll think about that later.

401
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:36,353
There is no problem in the
world that cannot be solved.

402
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,363
You can walk around
a little if You like.

403
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:49,766
But not so much that You get
tired and fall sick again.

404
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,766
Don't give her too much freedom.
You don't know her habits.

405
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:56,372
''lf You allow her to take a walk,
she'll start working. ''

406
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,774
''Doctor, the room
has been cleaned. ''

407
00:42:59,443 --> 00:43:00,535
Has a companion been
arranged for her?

408
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:03,646
''Not Yet. With Your permission,
shall l be her companion?''

409
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:05,679
You could not be Your
boyfriend's companion.

410
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:07,474
How will a patient tolerate You?

411
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:13,689
''Doctor, appoint me.
l am unemploYed. ''

412
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:16,293
''Even after trYing hard,
l cannot find a job. ''

413
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:20,692
''l'll be such a good companion,
he'll appoint me forever. ''

414
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:24,697
''l'm sorrY, but she is a girl.
She needs a ladY companion. ''

415
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:30,705
Bad luck here too.

416
00:43:58,402 --> 00:43:59,767
We are meeting after a long time.

417
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:05,241
She's grown so big! l'd seen
You when You were so little.

418
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:08,643
Take madam to her room.

419
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,245
''Come, Hirachand. ''

420
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,684
''Yes mom, the doctor
has reassured me. ''

421
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:22,281
l will return now
when l have a job.

422
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:26,296
''Alright son,
do keep writing. ''

423
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:32,293
''l'll write manY letters
to You, don't worrY. ''

424
00:44:44,381 --> 00:44:46,349
Even an abortion is not illegal.

425
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:50,349
''But personallY, l am against it.
What does Your daughter want?''

426
00:44:50,788 --> 00:44:52,346
Even she doesn't want it.

427
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:55,350
''But then,
what about the babY?''

428
00:44:57,394 --> 00:44:59,760
ManY orphanages
run on mY charitY.

429
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:03,233
Won't one more child fit in?

430
00:45:03,667 --> 00:45:07,626
- Will Preeti agree?
- She won't be told.

431
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:12,642
''Majumdar, You are mY
friend and sYmpathizer too. ''

432
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:14,675
l have complete faith in You.

433
00:45:15,312 --> 00:45:17,246
That is whY l have
brought Preeti here.

434
00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:21,284
''l'll take Your leave,
Preeti must be waiting. ''

435
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:30,293
You?

436
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:35,287
''Doctor, You said l
could roam around. ''

437
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:38,301
Appoint me as
that girl's companion.

438
00:45:38,535 --> 00:45:39,900
l will be occupied.

439
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:44,739
''And if l make some moneY,
mY son's burden will be reduced. ''

440
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:48,310
But Prem should not know.

441
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:50,744
''Alright, l'll consider it. ''

442
00:45:54,384 --> 00:45:57,353
''Sister, when will flowers
bloom on this plant?''

443
00:45:58,789 --> 00:45:59,756
Within three months.

444
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:13,635
''Preeti, You forgot to put
vermilion in Your parting again. ''

445
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:19,642
''Look dear, these little things
are done bY a wife, ... . ''

446
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:23,678
''... not for herself,
but for her husband's welfare. ''

447
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:48,304
l haven't appointed You
to fill vermilion...

448
00:46:48,505 --> 00:46:50,336
... in mY daughter's
parting... .

449
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:54,310
... but to lok after her
and be her companion.

450
00:46:54,778 --> 00:46:56,336
''How can You talk like that, sir?''

451
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,748
A married woman
must alwaYs use vermilion.

452
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:03,217
''Mother, l feel like eating green
vegetable with maize bread again. ''

453
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:06,623
''- Please make it for me.
- Alright, dear. ''

454
00:47:09,259 --> 00:47:10,226
''Come, dad. ''

455
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:37,685
l need a master like You.
You can start working from todaY.

456
00:47:39,323 --> 00:47:41,689
That staff quarter is for You.

457
00:48:02,646 --> 00:48:05,206
''Listen, You can lock up the
room and return to Your quarters. ''

458
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:08,213
''Look, it is verY necessarY
l staY with Preeti right now. ''

459
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:10,620
She has a nurse with her. Even
doctors will be present there.

460
00:48:10,754 --> 00:48:12,619
We'll call You when we need You.
Let's go.

461
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:16,219
''l'm Prem, Preeti. ''

462
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:19,622
Keep quiet!

463
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:25,228
l'm Prem.

464
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:39,231
You?... . Can l ask
whose babY this is?

465
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:45,671
Yours! Preeti wants to
hide this sin from the world.

466
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:52,277
''After being rid of this burden,
she will return to her fiance. ''

467
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:03,299
With or without the babY?

468
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:08,304
The babY will be
put in an orphanage... .

469
00:50:08,572 --> 00:50:11,336
... where such
children are normallY put.

470
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:14,339
But this child is not an orphan.

471
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:18,746
lf his mother doesn't
want to accept him...

472
00:50:18,882 --> 00:50:22,750
... l will rear him.
Give the child to me.

473
00:50:28,392 --> 00:50:32,761
l plead with You. Don't snatch
a father's right over the child.

474
00:50:33,397 --> 00:50:35,627
What is the guarantee
that with that right...

475
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:39,030
... You will not blackmail
me into surrendering... .

476
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:43,362
... mY daughter
and propertY to You?

477
00:50:44,441 --> 00:50:47,376
''l promise You,
me or mY child... . ''

478
00:50:47,577 --> 00:50:50,410
... will never
demand Your propertY.

479
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:54,815
You will never
trY to meet Preeti.

480
00:50:58,455 --> 00:50:59,422
No.

481
00:50:59,656 --> 00:51:03,683
And neither tell anYone that the
child shares our familY name.

482
00:51:04,327 --> 00:51:07,296
No.
You just give me mY child.

483
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:12,293
l promise l will never
tell him who his mother is.

484
00:51:14,371 --> 00:51:15,303
Come with me.

485
00:51:19,376 --> 00:51:22,311
''-Sister, did You see Mr. Hirachand?
-No. ''

486
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:33,356
How is Preeti?

487
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:35,348
She hasn't regained
consciousness Yet.

488
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:37,958
She had a caesarean.
But there is no need to worrY.

489
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:43,355
''Strange! l gave such a
rich man such good news, but... ''

490
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,374
l had bought these
sweets for mY mother.

491
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:54,808
You keep them.

492
00:51:56,446 --> 00:52:00,348
And keep this reward of Rs. 1 1.

493
00:52:05,322 --> 00:52:07,950
''Hirachand, Preeti hasn't
regained consciousness Yet. ''

494
00:52:08,325 --> 00:52:09,690
But there is no need to worrY.

495
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:15,287
l want to give that babY to him.
He will rear the babY.

496
00:52:17,734 --> 00:52:20,703
lf people like You begin
to accept such children... .

497
00:52:20,871 --> 00:52:24,739
... Young girls who make
mistakes can begin life anew.

498
00:52:28,378 --> 00:52:32,747
- CarrY him.
- Give the babY to me.

499
00:52:34,384 --> 00:52:37,353
His status will reduce
if he touches this babY.

500
00:52:38,388 --> 00:52:41,357
''Sister, prepare the papers and
take Mr. Prem's signatures on them. ''

501
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:45,750
Ensure no one comes to
know he is Preeti's babY.

502
00:52:52,402 --> 00:52:53,369
Listen.

503
00:53:02,312 --> 00:53:07,682
Sir... . donate this
to some orphanage... .

504
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:11,287
... which depends on the
charitY of good men like You.

505
00:53:13,323 --> 00:53:15,689
''For this babY, his father's
love is more than enough for him. ''

506
00:53:17,327 --> 00:53:18,294
''Let's go, son. ''

507
00:53:19,729 --> 00:53:23,688
''Hirachand, when Preeti recovers
and asks to see her babY... ''

508
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:26,302
... what will we tell her?

509
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:34,336
No! You're lYing!
That's not possible!

510
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:36,310
''Have courage, dear. ''

511
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,746
''Either You could have
been saved, or the babY. ''

512
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:47,356
''HeY, what is this?''

513
00:53:48,792 --> 00:53:52,353
- God's gift.
- God's gift?

514
00:53:52,596 --> 00:53:57,761
''Yes, mom. l got a job. l went
to the temple to thank God. ''

515
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:01,234
''Over there, a ladY
delivered him and died. ''

516
00:54:01,504 --> 00:54:04,632
''The priest handed over the
babY to me, l accepted it. ''

517
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:07,274
''Can we keep him, mom?''

518
00:54:07,711 --> 00:54:10,646
Children are an image of God.

519
00:54:11,715 --> 00:54:15,276
Wish this babY was Your own.

520
00:54:15,452 --> 00:54:18,683
''What difference
does it make, mom?''

521
00:54:19,322 --> 00:54:22,689
Some people shun
their own dear ones.

522
00:54:23,326 --> 00:54:25,294
And some accept
strangers as their own.

523
00:54:25,729 --> 00:54:27,697
''Whoever You accept
becomes dear, mom. ''

524
00:54:28,331 --> 00:54:29,696
l'll get some milk for mY son.

525
00:54:32,736 --> 00:54:34,294
MY dear babY!

526
00:54:37,374 --> 00:54:40,309
''- Sister, what did Preeti deliver?
- A babY boY, but stillborn. ''

527
00:54:54,391 --> 00:54:56,757
That is what God wanted.

528
00:54:58,995 --> 00:55:03,625
''You were unconscious,
and the doctors said... . ''

529
00:55:04,267 --> 00:55:05,632
... that the babY should soon...

530
00:55:06,269 --> 00:55:12,230
You should have atleast
let me see the babY's face.

531
00:55:12,709 --> 00:55:18,670
l was verY sorrY to hear it.

532
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:21,284
Strange are the waYs of God.

533
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:27,689
''He snatched Your son,
and his mother. ''

534
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:32,693
Whose babY is this?

535
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:36,299
The temple priest has given
him to mY son for upbringing.

536
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:38,699
''Take, mY dear. ''

537
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:51,746
''See how sweet the babY looks
in Preeti's arms, doesn't he?''

538
00:55:53,383 --> 00:55:57,752
''Preeti, You can keep him.
Assume he is Your son. ''

539
00:55:58,788 --> 00:56:00,619
- MY son?
- Yes.

540
00:56:01,257 --> 00:56:03,623
''You will get a son,
and he will get a mother. ''

541
00:56:08,264 --> 00:56:12,223
''l neither got the
love of a mother, ... ''

542
00:56:13,269 --> 00:56:15,237
... nor was
destined to be a mother.

543
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:19,241
lf there was a
child in mY destinY...

544
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:21,643
... whY would God
snatch mY child from me?

545
00:56:23,313 --> 00:56:28,683
MaY this babY live long
under Your and Your son's care.

546
00:56:34,324 --> 00:56:35,689
You keep him.

547
00:56:54,377 --> 00:56:58,336
''HeY, madam!
Listen! Wait!''

548
00:57:00,316 --> 00:57:02,614
''- Where is Your son?
- WhY, what is the matter?''

549
00:57:02,852 --> 00:57:05,616
''He took the babY, but he
has to sign the papers Yet. ''

550
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:07,883
The temple priest
gave him this babY.

551
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:10,226
Nonsense! The doctor
has given him the babY.

552
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:13,229
The doctor?

553
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:17,233
''Look, this is a secret,
l cannot tell You. ''

554
00:57:17,667 --> 00:57:20,636
But Your son knows everything.
Send him to me.

555
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:43,281
''- Mom, where had You gone?
- Come inside. ''

556
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:50,299
- Where did You get this babY?
- From the temple.

557
00:57:50,533 --> 00:57:51,898
''l told You,
the priest gave him to me. ''

558
00:57:52,335 --> 00:57:55,702
Then whY has the doctor
called You to sign his papers?

559
00:57:56,773 --> 00:57:58,297
l don't know.

560
00:57:58,508 --> 00:58:00,601
The nurse told me the
doctor gave You this babY.

561
00:58:02,245 --> 00:58:04,611
l told You the
priest gave him to me.

562
00:58:05,248 --> 00:58:06,613
The nurse is lYing.

563
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:10,219
ls this babY Preeti's?

564
00:58:15,258 --> 00:58:16,225
Who Preeti?

565
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:19,626
OnlY Preeti has delivered
a babY here todaY.

566
00:58:19,863 --> 00:58:22,229
And l think this is her babY.

567
00:58:25,268 --> 00:58:30,672
WhY don't You speak?
Tell me what the truth is... .

568
00:58:31,307 --> 00:58:32,672
... which onlY You know.

569
00:58:35,311 --> 00:58:39,270
WhY was Preeti told she
delivered a stillborn babY?

570
00:58:40,316 --> 00:58:42,682
And whY was her
babY given to You?

571
00:58:45,722 --> 00:58:47,690
What is Your
relationship with Preeti?

572
00:58:51,327 --> 00:58:55,286
Will You answer me
or do l go and ask Preeti?

573
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:57,693
''For God's sake, please don't
ask me anything for now. ''

574
00:58:59,335 --> 00:59:00,563
l have some reasons.

575
00:59:01,237 --> 00:59:03,603
l'll tell You everything
when the time comes.

576
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,605
l'll tell You everything.

577
00:59:30,266 --> 00:59:31,233
''Mom, don't run!''

578
00:59:32,268 --> 00:59:33,235
''Mom, stop!''

579
00:59:46,316 --> 00:59:47,283
''Mom, stop!''

580
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:58,284
''- What happened, mom?
- l'm going to die. ''

581
00:59:58,728 --> 01:00:05,292
Just tell me once
that he is Your son.

582
01:00:06,736 --> 01:00:08,294
That he is mY grandson.

583
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:16,336
''l don't have time, son. ''

584
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:18,745
Tell me quicklY.

585
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:24,753
''Yes mom, he is Your grandson. ''

586
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:28,347
MY darling!

587
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:52,774
''O mY son, ... ''

... listen

589
01:01:58,848 --> 01:02:01,282
Even if there are sorrows...

... . keep smiling

591
01:02:36,385 --> 01:02:39,752
''WhY do You crY, mY son''

592
01:02:40,389 --> 01:02:43,756
''WhY are You wasting
the pearls of Your eYes''

593
01:02:44,393 --> 01:02:47,760
''l am Your toY,
l am Your friend''

594
01:02:48,397 --> 01:02:51,764
''l am Your companion

595
01:02:52,401 --> 01:02:56,360
''l am Your support,
You are mY support''

596
01:02:56,839 --> 01:02:58,773

Come to me!

598
01:03:04,914 --> 01:03:06,882
O mY son... .

01:03:48,391 --> 01:03:51,758
AlwaYs have faith in God

600
01:03:52,395 --> 01:03:55,762
''He is the one who has
brought us into this world''

601
01:03:56,399 --> 01:04:00,301
''Your father maY not
be with You alwaYs''

602
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:04,231
''He maY not be there to
saY these words again''

603
01:04:04,707 --> 01:04:08,643
''Don't forget what l have said,
God is our Saviour''

604
01:04:09,312 --> 01:04:10,677
Don't ever lose faith in Him

605
01:04:11,314 --> 01:04:12,679
Come to me!

606
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:19,288
O mY son... .

''What l had wished to
bring, and what l have bought''

608
01:04:56,792 --> 01:05:00,284
''l was overwhelmed
giving it to You''

609
01:05:00,663 --> 01:05:04,224
Take these crutches

610
01:05:04,667 --> 01:05:08,228
With mY unfortunate hands

611
01:05:08,704 --> 01:05:13,232
Walk with their support

612
01:05:13,709 --> 01:05:15,233
''Walk, papa's pet''

613
01:05:16,312 --> 01:05:17,677
Come to me!

614
01:05:21,317 --> 01:05:23,683
O mY papa... .

... keep smiling

618
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:23,676
''- Hi, Master!
- You are earlY todaY. ''

619
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:27,680
l want to go back earlY todaY
for something special.

620
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:30,285
There is reallY
something special todaY.

621
01:06:31,721 --> 01:06:33,279
''You can onlY
look at her, Manohar. ''

622
01:06:33,456 --> 01:06:35,287
All that dressing up
is onlY for Master.

623
01:06:35,725 --> 01:06:38,888
Even l am a master
in several things.

624
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:41,296
TrY taking tuition
from me too sometime.

625
01:06:41,731 --> 01:06:44,291
And see what tricks l teach You.

626
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:47,302
Keep talking nonsense.

627
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:52,298
But one blow from Master and
You'll forget all Your tricks.

628
01:06:52,775 --> 01:06:55,710
''Just go and complain to him.
He is one, we are four. ''

629
01:06:56,379 --> 01:06:59,348
Attention!

630
01:07:00,316 --> 01:07:05,219
''The Queen of Skating,
Ms. TickY, is entering the ring!''

631
01:07:14,663 --> 01:07:17,223
''lf You hadn't caught me in time,
like Rahul, even l... . . ''

632
01:07:24,306 --> 01:07:27,241
''Master, teach me too. ''

633
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:29,234
''Look TickY,
You skate well now. ''

634
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:31,646
l don't need to hold Your
hand to help You skate.

635
01:07:32,314 --> 01:07:34,680
''Perhaps You don't know,
but when an lndian girl... . ''

636
01:07:34,817 --> 01:07:36,284
... takes someone's
hand into hers... .

637
01:07:36,519 --> 01:07:38,282
... she never lets go.

638
01:07:39,321 --> 01:07:42,290
''TickY, perhaps
even You don't know... . ''

639
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:43,789
''... that when a man marries, ... ''

640
01:07:43,926 --> 01:07:45,621
... he doesn't even think
of another girl. Understand?

641
01:07:56,772 --> 01:07:58,706
''Papa, l'm here!''

642
01:08:01,644 --> 01:08:03,578
Papa! Look.
l have come.

643
01:08:05,648 --> 01:08:08,208
''Hello, son!''

644
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:13,221
No remarks from
the teacher todaY?

645
01:08:13,656 --> 01:08:15,624
- Just one.
- What?

646
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:20,217
One boY abused me.
How could l staY quiet?

647
01:08:20,663 --> 01:08:23,632
l beat him up!

648
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:28,226
''FinallY, l kicked him,
and he fell hard. ''

649
01:08:29,705 --> 01:08:32,230
l have kept sandwiches
and hot milk for You.

650
01:08:32,708 --> 01:08:34,642
Go and take it.
Good boY!

651
01:08:36,312 --> 01:08:39,679
''Great, son!
You are a bigger fibber than me. ''

652
01:10:39,802 --> 01:10:40,769
The master fell down!

653
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:47,775
''Papa, whY do people
laugh when someone falls?''

654
01:10:48,444 --> 01:10:52,403
''lt's the norm, son. People
feel happY seeing others fall. ''

655
01:10:52,581 --> 01:10:54,412
But people help
me when l fall.

656
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:56,744
That's because
You are a kid still.

657
01:10:56,852 --> 01:11:00,618
''When You grow up, those who
support You, will leave You alone. ''

658
01:11:00,723 --> 01:11:02,691
''l don't need
anYone's support, papa. ''

659
01:11:02,825 --> 01:11:04,690
''When l grow up,
l'll be cured. ''

660
01:11:04,827 --> 01:11:08,695
''MY legs will become so strong, no
one will be able to pull me down. ''

661
01:11:08,831 --> 01:11:11,698
''BY then, l will grow old,
and l'll need support. ''

662
01:11:12,334 --> 01:11:15,303
l will support You.
l will not leave You like mom.

663
01:11:17,373 --> 01:11:18,305
''ReallY, son?''

664
01:11:20,376 --> 01:11:22,742
''HeY, what are You
two gossiping about?''

665
01:11:23,045 --> 01:11:25,343
That's between us.

666
01:11:25,581 --> 01:11:28,744
Alright! Will You come to the
airport with me in the evening?

667
01:11:29,385 --> 01:11:30,750
Airport? WhY?

668
01:11:30,886 --> 01:11:33,354
Brother is returning from abroad
todaY. l'm going to pick him.

669
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:36,349
''Can l go, papa?
MY darling papa!''

670
01:11:47,403 --> 01:11:49,769
''Rahul, the plane has landed.
l'm going to take the ticket. ''

671
01:11:49,938 --> 01:11:51,371
- You follow.
- Alright.

672
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:07,880
''Son, are You hurt?''

673
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:11,691
WhY do You drive so fast?

674
01:12:12,728 --> 01:12:14,696
Where am l at fault?

675
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:17,299
This handicapped boY
should have been careful.

676
01:12:17,533 --> 01:12:19,501
''HeY car owner! lt's You
who is handicapped, not me!''

677
01:12:19,735 --> 01:12:23,694
''Wear glasses! Along with cars,
even people walk on the roads. ''

678
01:12:23,872 --> 01:12:27,308
You brazen fellow!
You don't look and walk...

679
01:12:27,509 --> 01:12:29,977
... and ask me to wear glasses?
What is Your name?

680
01:12:30,379 --> 01:12:33,746
''You give me Your name & address,
and also Your license number. ''

681
01:12:33,982 --> 01:12:35,745
l want to lodge a complaint
with the police. Tell me!

682
01:12:36,385 --> 01:12:38,751
''Son, excuse him this time. ''

683
01:12:39,788 --> 01:12:41,756
l'll forgive him for You.

684
01:12:43,392 --> 01:12:44,757
l forgive You.

685
01:12:45,394 --> 01:12:48,761
He is verY brave.
He is not afraid even of You.

686
01:12:49,798 --> 01:12:50,765
Forget him.

687
01:12:53,402 --> 01:12:55,768
''Here, take this.
BuY sweets for Yourself. ''

688
01:12:56,438 --> 01:12:58,372
Even l have moneY to buY sweets.

689
01:12:59,441 --> 01:13:01,671
''You keep that,
and buY Yourself glasses. ''

690
01:13:03,312 --> 01:13:05,678
''Rahul, hurrY up, brother
is going to come out of customs. ''

691
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:12,685
- How are You?
- l am fine.

692
01:13:14,323 --> 01:13:16,689
''- Who is he?
- He is mY friend, Rahul. ''

693
01:13:17,326 --> 01:13:18,293
Bless You.

694
01:13:21,330 --> 01:13:22,695
MY to-be sister-in-law.

695
01:13:22,931 --> 01:13:24,899
And that is mY brother's
to-be father-in-law.

696
01:13:25,334 --> 01:13:28,701
''TickY, Your brother has
chosen a lovelY bride. ''

697
01:13:29,371 --> 01:13:32,306
But not a good father-in-law.

698
01:13:57,399 --> 01:13:59,367
''What happened, Amar?''

699
01:13:59,802 --> 01:14:03,670
l felt dizzY. The same dizziness
that You felt when l was leaving.

700
01:14:04,306 --> 01:14:06,240
l felt that same dizziness
in the joY of mY return.

701
01:14:06,708 --> 01:14:08,232
Like it is said. .

702
01:14:08,710 --> 01:14:11,645
''A lover was worried
seeing his beloved sick''

703
01:14:11,914 --> 01:14:15,281
''And the beloved recovered
on seeing his lover''

704
01:14:15,717 --> 01:14:17,275
Your jokes have started
the moment You are back.

705
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:20,288
Look there!
Do You recognise her?

706
01:14:22,324 --> 01:14:23,689
Who is she?

707
01:14:25,327 --> 01:14:27,693
l think l have seen You before.
Who are You?

708
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:30,696
- l am TickY.
- How can You be TickY?

709
01:14:30,933 --> 01:14:34,300
TickY was mY little sister.
l have bought this doll for her.

710
01:14:34,503 --> 01:14:36,698
This is not mY age
to plaY with dolls.

711
01:14:37,372 --> 01:14:39,306
''Yes uncle, she is
onlY big bY age... ''

712
01:14:39,575 --> 01:14:41,338
... but has less
intelligence than even me.

713
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:45,742
''So even You are here,
grandfather! But who are You?''

714
01:14:46,381 --> 01:14:48,611
''He's Rahul,
mY skating master's son. ''

715
01:14:48,784 --> 01:14:52,743
''OkaY. Son, when did You
get inflicted with this?''

716
01:14:53,789 --> 01:14:57,748
''Since l could walk,
l have been walking on crutches. ''

717
01:14:58,393 --> 01:15:00,623
''Preeti, a similar case
had come to me even there. ''

718
01:15:01,263 --> 01:15:03,629
l had cured him.
l will cure You too.

719
01:15:03,765 --> 01:15:06,632
''Amar, You have opened Your
clinic at the airport itself. ''

720
01:15:06,768 --> 01:15:08,633
Come home and take rest.

721
01:15:09,304 --> 01:15:12,239
''Brother, l have thrown a partY
in celebration of Your return. ''

722
01:15:12,441 --> 01:15:13,635
WhY not invite them too?

723
01:15:16,311 --> 01:15:19,678
''Son, bring Your mom and dad
along for the partY tomorrow. ''

724
01:15:19,815 --> 01:15:22,283
l want to discuss Your
condition with them.

725
01:15:22,718 --> 01:15:25,278
''Doctor uncle,
l have a father, no mother. ''

726
01:15:26,321 --> 01:15:27,288
''l am sorrY, child. ''

727
01:15:28,323 --> 01:15:31,554
''Uncle, mY papa
doesn't attend anY parties. ''

728
01:15:31,727 --> 01:15:33,024
He gets bored at parties.

729
01:15:33,328 --> 01:15:35,888
''Ask him to trY this partY.
Right, Preeti?''

730
01:15:36,331 --> 01:15:37,059
Yes. We promise we will not let
him get bored even for a second.

731
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:43,294
''The waY You
are looking at me, ... ''

732
01:15:43,505 --> 01:15:45,336
... like as if You are
seeing me for the first time.

733
01:15:47,776 --> 01:15:49,300
That's what is special about You.

734
01:15:49,778 --> 01:15:52,747
''Whenever l see You,
l see a different You. ''

735
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:57,352
That is what You must have been
telling everY girl in GermanY.

736
01:15:58,387 --> 01:16:01,618
''l surelY would, if l'd met
a beautiful girl like You. ''

737
01:16:02,658 --> 01:16:04,626
That would have been better.

738
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:08,227
l would have been
saved the responsibilities.

739
01:16:10,265 --> 01:16:11,630
There is onlY one waY
You can save Yourself now.

740
01:16:12,267 --> 01:16:14,235
And that is to get trapped.

741
01:16:14,670 --> 01:16:17,230
''Make me surrender to You,
and surrender Yourself to me. ''

742
01:16:17,706 --> 01:16:23,235
''Then we will be one life,
one soul, one bodY, one... ''

743
01:16:23,712 --> 01:16:25,646
Enough!

744
01:16:25,914 --> 01:16:28,280
Get them married now.

745
01:16:28,717 --> 01:16:31,686
Or he'll go back to
GermanY for another 14 Years.

746
01:16:32,321 --> 01:16:34,687
You think l am
foolish like You?

747
01:16:35,324 --> 01:16:37,292
l am going to announce
their marriage todaY itself.

748
01:16:46,735 --> 01:16:48,293
WhY are You standing
with a sullen face?

749
01:16:48,570 --> 01:16:51,300
Rahul and Master
haven't come Yet.

750
01:16:51,773 --> 01:16:54,708
TheY will come. Can't enjoY
the partY without them?

751
01:16:55,377 --> 01:17:00,610
''You are a doctor,
You don't understand emotions. ''

752
01:17:01,249 --> 01:17:04,218
''TickY, You gave Your
heart to someone alreadY?''

753
01:17:04,453 --> 01:17:06,216
Nonsense!
TickY is still a kid.

754
01:17:07,255 --> 01:17:10,622
How do l explain? Lata and
Rita said theY will not come.

755
01:17:11,259 --> 01:17:12,624
l have laid a bet with them.

756
01:17:14,262 --> 01:17:17,231
Then do one thing.
Pick a finger.

757
01:17:18,266 --> 01:17:19,631
TheY will surelY come.

758
01:17:26,308 --> 01:17:28,242
''TickY, we lost the bet. ''

759
01:17:34,716 --> 01:17:36,547
l thought You will not come.

760
01:17:36,718 --> 01:17:39,687
''He came because l insisted,
not because of You. ''

761
01:17:39,921 --> 01:17:43,687
''OkaY, with Your insistence.
But atleast You came. ''

762
01:17:43,925 --> 01:17:45,290
Better late than never.

763
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:49,297
TickY has been
waiting for You.

764
01:17:49,464 --> 01:17:51,295
''l am TickY's
elder brother, Amar. ''

765
01:17:51,733 --> 01:17:53,701
''l'm Prem, Rahul's daddY. ''

766
01:17:53,935 --> 01:17:55,698
''- Hello, doctor uncle.
- Hello, son. ''

767
01:17:56,371 --> 01:17:58,305
- Rahul was all praise for You.
- And TickY was praise for You.

768
01:17:58,573 --> 01:18:02,202
l am grateful for the sYmpathY
You have shown towards mY son.

769
01:18:02,377 --> 01:18:05,210
lt's not sYmpathY. A similar
case came to me in GermanY.

770
01:18:05,447 --> 01:18:08,211
Give me Rahul's case historY.
Come with me.

771
01:18:13,255 --> 01:18:15,621
''She must be around.
Tell me, what will You have?''

772
01:18:22,264 --> 01:18:24,232
''Alright wait, l'll check. ''

773
01:18:24,466 --> 01:18:26,434
The child l had treated
in GermanY...

774
01:18:26,668 --> 01:18:28,636
... his case was less
complicated than Rahul's.

775
01:18:29,304 --> 01:18:30,236
That case... .

776
01:18:30,439 --> 01:18:32,430
Does that mean Rahul's
recoverY is not possible?

777
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:33,640
lt's not that.

778
01:18:34,309 --> 01:18:35,674
''ActuallY, if the case is
not a little complicated... ''

779
01:18:35,811 --> 01:18:37,244
... its treatment
isn't interesting.

780
01:18:38,313 --> 01:18:43,273
''Tell me, does Rahul
miss his mother?''

781
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:46,279
''No, l have given him the love
of both, father and mother. ''

782
01:18:47,322 --> 01:18:52,282
''You are not aware, but
Rahul's mother didn't love him. ''

783
01:18:52,394 --> 01:18:53,691
Or whY would she leave him?

784
01:18:54,329 --> 01:18:57,298
Can a woman be so hard hearted?

785
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:01,566
''There are different
kinds of women, doctor. ''

786
01:19:10,245 --> 01:19:11,610
What will You drink?

787
01:19:13,248 --> 01:19:15,614
- l...
- You must have something.

788
01:19:16,251 --> 01:19:17,616
l'll just be back.

789
01:19:22,257 --> 01:19:24,623
- You've come?
- We came a long time ago.

790
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:26,418
You were not to be seen.

791
01:19:26,661 --> 01:19:28,629
''Come, l'll introduce
You to mY father. ''

792
01:19:29,264 --> 01:19:30,231
Come.

793
01:19:49,317 --> 01:19:53,276
''He is mY papa, and
she is mY beautiful auntY. ''

794
01:19:53,722 --> 01:19:56,282
And also mY beautiful fiancee.

795
01:19:57,325 --> 01:19:59,691
We are both doctors
and patients too.

796
01:19:59,828 --> 01:20:03,696
MY cure is with her
and her cure is with me.

797
01:20:04,332 --> 01:20:08,291
''lf You two cure each other,
what about the patients?''

798
01:20:08,770 --> 01:20:11,705
- What do You mean?
- l was talking of this patient.

799
01:20:12,374 --> 01:20:15,741
''He is mY heart, mY soul,
everything!''

800
01:20:17,379 --> 01:20:18,311
Amar... .

801
01:20:22,384 --> 01:20:24,352
''He is Mr. Prem,
Rahul's father. ''

802
01:20:24,586 --> 01:20:27,350
''And he is Preeti's father,
Mr. Hirachand. ''

803
01:20:27,789 --> 01:20:28,756
- Hello.
- Hello.

804
01:20:29,391 --> 01:20:31,359
''Come, l'll introduce
You to the Collector. ''

805
01:20:35,397 --> 01:20:38,366
''Papa, he is that car owner. ''

806
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:40,563
Wonder what he thinks of himself.

807
01:20:40,802 --> 01:20:42,770
Shhh! You should not
talk like that about elders.

808
01:20:52,447 --> 01:20:53,414
Here's Your ice-cream.

809
01:21:00,388 --> 01:21:01,286
Sir!

810
01:21:02,324 --> 01:21:03,689
Where are You going?

811
01:21:04,326 --> 01:21:05,293
''Hello, sir. ''

812
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:27,746
- PlaY some game.
- What game?

813
01:21:29,384 --> 01:21:31,750
- Musical chairs? Over here?
- Then where else?

814
01:21:32,387 --> 01:21:34,753
''lf You don't plaY,
l'll take mY papa and leave. ''

815
01:21:35,390 --> 01:21:37,756
''Alright, wait. ''

816
01:21:43,798 --> 01:21:45,766
We will plaY
musical chairs.

817
01:21:46,401 --> 01:21:48,369
The one who wins
will sing a song.

818
01:21:48,837 --> 01:21:50,361
''TickY, what is all this about?''

819
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:52,368
lt's Rahul's demand.

820
01:21:54,442 --> 01:21:56,376
''Rahul, if You make
such foolish demands... . ''

821
01:21:56,578 --> 01:21:58,409
... l'll never attend
parties with You again.

822
01:22:01,316 --> 01:22:03,682
''So what, don't break his heart. ''

823
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:06,287
''Yes Mr. Prem, let us plaY. ''

824
01:22:06,521 --> 01:22:08,682
Our old memories will get
refreshd on this pretext.

825
01:22:42,390 --> 01:22:45,359
''HeY, whY have You come here?''

826
01:22:47,395 --> 01:22:50,023
You are aware that l
unintentionallY...

827
01:22:50,398 --> 01:22:52,366
... . reach the wrong
place at the wrong time.

828
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:55,361
''But don't worrY,
l remember mY promise. ''

829
01:22:56,438 --> 01:22:57,803
Wipe Your brow.

830
01:23:07,315 --> 01:23:10,284
You got a seat?

''AuntY, l call You auntY,
and call doctor uncle, uncle. ''

832
01:23:14,923 --> 01:23:16,686
What should l call Your father?

833
01:23:19,327 --> 01:23:21,693
- Call him grandpa.
- Grandpa.

834
01:23:33,375 --> 01:23:36,310
''Master, whY aren't You

836
01:23:42,384 --> 01:23:45,751
''Along with Rahul,

01:23:55,397 --> 01:23:58,764
''- Grandpa.
- Not grandpa, call me sir. ''

838
01:23:58,900 --> 01:24:01,630
''Alright, sir.
Will You buY these tickets, sir?''

839
01:24:02,303 --> 01:24:04,237

840
01:24:04,439 --> 01:24:07,272
''Please buY them,

842
01:24:10,311 --> 01:24:13,280
''Come on, buY it. What will

843
01:24:14,315 --> 01:24:17,944
''- lt's for a good cause.
- Yes, l know. Take. ''

844
01:24:18,319 --> 01:24:19,684
God bless Your children.

845
01:24:35,370 --> 01:24:39,306
Did You notice? DaddY bought the
entire raffle book from Your son.

846
01:24:40,375 --> 01:24:41,740
Rich men can buY anything.

847
01:24:42,377 --> 01:24:44,743
People sell everything
to rich men.

848
01:24:47,382 --> 01:24:49,350
MY son onlY sold a book.

849
01:24:50,385 --> 01:24:54,344
You didn't bring
Rahul's mother along?

850
01:24:55,390 --> 01:24:57,756
- She is with me.
- Where is she?

851
01:25:00,662 --> 01:25:01,629
ln mY heart.

852
01:25:18,713 --> 01:25:20,681
''You have a verY good
choice, Dr. Amar. ''

853
01:25:21,316 --> 01:25:24,683
That is whY we waited for
each other for seven Years.

854
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:29,279
''lf You were in mY place, wouldn't
You wait for a girl like Preeti?''

855
01:25:30,725 --> 01:25:34,286
l surelY would.
l'd wait all mY life.

856
01:25:35,330 --> 01:25:36,695
''You are verY luckY, doctor. ''

857
01:25:37,332 --> 01:25:40,699
''You were right, Prem. There
are different tYpes of women. ''

858
01:26:08,897 --> 01:26:09,829
Start!

859
01:26:15,904 --> 01:26:19,271
''- Papa, which song do l sing?
- Sing anY song, son. ''

860
01:26:23,912 --> 01:26:25,880
''No Rahul,
don't sing this song. ''

861
01:26:28,316 --> 01:26:31,285
''Let him sing.
Sing the same song, son. ''

862
01:26:55,310 --> 01:26:59,269
''We probablY knew each
other before this life''

863
01:26:59,914 --> 01:27:03,816
''You don't just like
a person for no reason''

864
01:27:12,894 --> 01:27:18,264
''Whether You are
aware of it or not''

865
01:27:20,902 --> 01:27:26,863
Whether You believe it or not

866
01:27:56,304 --> 01:27:59,865
''Look, don't get lost now''

867
01:28:00,842 --> 01:28:03,811
''Don't ever get
separated from me''

868
01:28:13,855 --> 01:28:17,814
We will staY united this time

869
01:28:18,293 --> 01:28:21,820
''This is a
promise we make todaY''

870
01:28:22,297 --> 01:28:27,860
''Whether You are
aware of it or not''

871
01:28:30,905 --> 01:28:36,866
Whether You believe it or not

872
01:29:02,236 --> 01:29:04,796
''What comes next, daddY?
l forgot. ''

873
01:29:10,845 --> 01:29:13,814
''All promises are broken,
all talks forgotten''

874
01:29:14,849 --> 01:29:18,216
''All those nights that
l spent awake are gone''

875
01:29:19,854 --> 01:29:22,823
l didn't get the one l loved

876
01:29:23,891 --> 01:29:26,826
''Yet, l have no complaints''

877
01:29:27,895 --> 01:29:31,831
Whether l live or die

878
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:35,869
Atleast You lived a happY life

879
01:29:36,304 --> 01:29:42,265
''Whether You are
aware of it or not''

880
01:29:44,912 --> 01:29:50,873
Whether You believe it or not

881
01:30:43,971 --> 01:30:45,939
''EverYone applauded,
but You didn't. ''

882
01:30:46,374 --> 01:30:49,343
You probablY
didn't like the song?

883
01:30:50,978 --> 01:30:53,947
- l...
- lt's nothing like that.

884
01:31:01,456 --> 01:31:03,822
She cannot bear to see
anYone unhappY. Right?

885
01:31:04,892 --> 01:31:06,826
Hearing such a nice sing and
seeing the boY's condition...

886
01:31:07,028 --> 01:31:08,222
... . brought tears to her eYes.

887
01:31:08,896 --> 01:31:11,831
This shouldn't have happened
with such a smart child.

888
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:15,266
''l will treat him,
and he will be cured. ''

889
01:31:15,903 --> 01:31:21,864
''Uncle, all doctors saY that,
but no one has cured me Yet. ''

890
01:31:22,043 --> 01:31:23,874
So You are challenging me?

891
01:31:24,912 --> 01:31:26,277
''Rahul, You acted brazen again!''

892
01:31:26,914 --> 01:31:30,873
''No, he is right.
Kid, l accept Your challenge. ''

893
01:31:34,922 --> 01:31:37,891
l want to make an
announcement before You.

894
01:31:38,359 --> 01:31:40,293
''Amar, l want to make
an announcement first. ''

895
01:31:40,962 --> 01:31:42,896
''SorrY uncle,
it is a matter of mY honour. ''

896
01:31:43,965 --> 01:31:46,331
lt will be better if
l make mY announcement first.

897
01:31:46,968 --> 01:31:50,335
''TodaY, l promise
before You all... . ''

898
01:31:50,972 --> 01:31:53,941
... that until l
cure Rahul's handicap... .

899
01:31:54,909 --> 01:31:56,274
... . l will not get married.

900
01:32:05,853 --> 01:32:08,219
''Papa, wasn't auntY good?''

901
01:32:10,892 --> 01:32:12,826
lsn't mY choice good?

902
01:32:13,895 --> 01:32:17,831
- Whose son are You after all?
- MY handsome papa's!

903
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:22,859
And also Your
beautiful mummY's.

904
01:32:23,304 --> 01:32:27,866
''Papa, was mY mom more
beautiful than auntY?''

905
01:32:30,912 --> 01:32:34,279
When l met Your
mom the first time... .

906
01:32:34,916 --> 01:32:37,885
... l found her
to be verY beautiful.

907
01:32:39,921 --> 01:32:41,889
But wonder how
she changed later.

908
01:32:42,924 --> 01:32:45,893
The sweetness in
her talks changed.

909
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:48,294
The love in her eYes changed.

910
01:32:48,963 --> 01:32:54,265
''Papa, seeing auntY todaY,
l am missing mom verY much. ''

911
01:32:55,303 --> 01:32:57,271
You used to saY that
You'll show me her picture.

912
01:32:57,505 --> 01:33:00,804
Show me her picture todaY.
Or l will not go to bed.

913
01:33:04,845 --> 01:33:08,804
''WhY are You getting angrY, papa?
l didn't ask for mother. ''

914
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:11,218
l onlY asked for her picture.

915
01:33:20,895 --> 01:33:25,264
''Don't crY, Rahul. How do l
explain mY helplessness to You?''

916
01:33:27,902 --> 01:33:29,893
''l promise You,
when the time comes... . ''

917
01:33:31,105 --> 01:33:33,869
... l'll surelY
take You to meet Your mom.

918
01:33:49,924 --> 01:33:52,290
''Yes, l have come
to learn skating. ''

919
01:33:56,297 --> 01:33:59,232
l have paid the fees. l
have also become a life member.

920
01:33:59,900 --> 01:34:02,198
''You will teach me
skating, won't You?''

921
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:08,206
What can l teach You?

922
01:34:08,843 --> 01:34:10,811
You know to skate verY well.

923
01:34:12,847 --> 01:34:14,815
''l did, but l have forgotten now. ''

924
01:34:15,850 --> 01:34:17,818
What is the harm in
learning once again?

925
01:34:18,252 --> 01:34:22,211
''One who can learn and forget,
can forget once again. ''

926
01:34:22,857 --> 01:34:25,826
''No, l will surelY
remember this time. ''

927
01:34:26,293 --> 01:34:29,820
But first agree to teach me.

928
01:34:31,899 --> 01:34:33,264
MY job is to teach.

929
01:34:33,901 --> 01:34:37,268
''To learn and remember,
or forget is Yours. ''

930
01:34:38,906 --> 01:34:41,272
- Come.
- Let's go.

931
01:34:44,311 --> 01:34:48,270
''- Tell me something, Prem.
- Not Prem, call me Master. ''

932
01:34:48,916 --> 01:34:53,285
Alright Master.
Did You love onlY Your wife?

933
01:34:54,855 --> 01:34:56,823
You cannot do
two things at a time.

934
01:34:57,291 --> 01:34:58,815
Just skate while skating.

935
01:35:01,829 --> 01:35:04,195
WhY did she leave You?

936
01:35:06,834 --> 01:35:09,200
You have wheels
under Your feet.

937
01:35:09,837 --> 01:35:11,805
''lf You slip,
You can have a bad fall. ''

938
01:35:12,239 --> 01:35:13,206
So be careful.

939
01:35:19,847 --> 01:35:22,213
Will You spend all
Your life like this?

940
01:35:23,851 --> 01:35:27,218
One who forgets his first
lesson needs to learn again.

941
01:35:27,855 --> 01:35:29,220
You know skating verY well.

942
01:35:29,890 --> 01:35:31,824
l don't need to teach You.

943
01:35:32,293 --> 01:35:34,227
TheY make a nice pair.

944
01:35:34,895 --> 01:35:37,830
And Master is taking
pains to teach his new pupil.

945
01:35:44,905 --> 01:35:47,271
''Her time is over,
mY time begins now. ''

946
01:35:50,911 --> 01:35:53,277
Since when did You develop
an interest to learn skating?

947
01:35:53,914 --> 01:35:57,873
''ln Shimla. l started there,
but left it midwaY. ''

948
01:35:58,319 --> 01:36:00,810
When l came here and heard
You praise Master... . .

949
01:36:00,988 --> 01:36:02,819
... l developed
the interest again.

950
01:36:03,257 --> 01:36:06,226
''TickY, neither would You
have praised me so much... ''

951
01:36:06,894 --> 01:36:08,259
... nor would she
develop an interest again.

952
01:36:09,897 --> 01:36:12,832
''- Come Master, teach me.
- Come. ''

953
01:36:26,914 --> 01:36:29,883
''Even You have started skating?
EverYone skates, except me. ''

954
01:36:30,317 --> 01:36:32,877
''No son, even You will
learn to skate one daY. ''

955
01:36:33,921 --> 01:36:37,880
''Be careful, auntY. lf You
fall, You'll become like me. ''

956
01:36:38,359 --> 01:36:39,883
Let's go and sit there.

957
01:36:45,966 --> 01:36:47,934
''TickY, skate bY
Yourself for sometime. ''

958
01:36:52,373 --> 01:36:56,275
Master doesn't even have
time to teach You now.

959
01:36:59,914 --> 01:37:04,214
''Rahul, You must be
missing Your mom a lot. ''

960
01:37:05,252 --> 01:37:08,221
''l onlY miss her,
but she doesn't come. ''

961
01:37:09,256 --> 01:37:11,486
''Doesn't matter,
even she will come. ''

962
01:37:11,892 --> 01:37:16,124
''Even papa saYs that. But whether
mom comes or not, l don't care. ''

963
01:37:16,297 --> 01:37:18,231
l am verY happY with mY papa.

964
01:37:18,499 --> 01:37:23,266
Oh. So You mean
You don't need Your mother.

965
01:37:23,904 --> 01:37:26,270
l do.
l was onlY fibbing.

966
01:37:26,407 --> 01:37:29,274
''lf You meet mY mother,
don't tell her this, ... ''

967
01:37:29,910 --> 01:37:32,276
... . or she won't come
even if she wants to.

968
01:37:32,913 --> 01:37:37,873
''l won't. lnstead l'll saY,
that Rahul is waiting for her. ''

969
01:37:38,319 --> 01:37:39,286
ReallY?

970
01:37:39,420 --> 01:37:41,285
''Someone is on fire,
l see smoke. ''

971
01:37:41,422 --> 01:37:44,289
Someone's heart is on fire.

972
01:37:45,359 --> 01:37:47,293
She had been
pinning her hopes on him.

973
01:37:47,962 --> 01:37:49,896
But this new ladY is verY smart.

974
01:37:50,364 --> 01:37:53,925
''She knows all the tricks. Like
TickY, even she is wooing the kid. ''

975
01:37:56,904 --> 01:37:57,871
You impudent man!

976
01:38:05,446 --> 01:38:09,212
Don't You ever dare do
that in the ring again.

977
01:38:11,252 --> 01:38:15,814
l'll remember this. This will
never happen again in the ring.

978
01:38:17,892 --> 01:38:21,828
''That was great, Master.
l knew You'd come to mY rescue. ''

979
01:38:22,296 --> 01:38:24,821
Like the hero comes to
save the heroine in films.

980
01:38:25,900 --> 01:38:26,832
Go and skate.

981
01:38:33,908 --> 01:38:35,876
Can l take Rahul home with me?

982
01:38:36,043 --> 01:38:37,271
l will send him
back in the evening.

983
01:38:37,912 --> 01:38:39,880
''But he has to studY,
his exams are nearing. ''

984
01:38:40,047 --> 01:38:42,880
l am prepared for mY exams.
Please allow me to go.

985
01:38:43,317 --> 01:38:44,875
Let him come with me.

986
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:47,888
l don't want to
make him like me.

987
01:38:48,322 --> 01:38:50,290
l have failed in everY exam.

988
01:38:50,958 --> 01:38:53,893
But he will clear
his everY exam.

989
01:38:54,895 --> 01:38:57,830
''Let me go,
mY handsome papa. ''

990
01:39:01,235 --> 01:39:03,203
''Alright, but come back soon. ''

991
01:39:24,892 --> 01:39:27,258
''You sit here,
l'll change and come. ''

992
01:39:27,895 --> 01:39:30,261
''Ramu, get some
fruit for the child. ''

993
01:40:06,300 --> 01:40:10,259
'You brazen fellow!
You don't look and walk...

994
01:40:10,404 --> 01:40:12,872
... and ask me to wear glasses?'

995
01:40:13,907 --> 01:40:17,866
You cannot buY a book
containing 50 tickets... .

996
01:40:18,045 --> 01:40:22,880
''... and You are standing here
with pride? Get down, Get down!''

997
01:40:23,050 --> 01:40:25,280
HeY! How did You come here?

998
01:40:25,919 --> 01:40:28,285

01:40:28,922 --> 01:40:30,890

1000
01:40:36,964 --> 01:40:38,898
''SorrY sir,

1002
01:40:41,969 --> 01:40:43,937
''- Greetings, sir.
- Greetings. ''

1003
01:41:15,903 --> 01:41:17,871
What are You doing!

1004
01:41:18,505 --> 01:41:21,872
lt's a dirtY picture. Good
people don't see such pictures.

1005
01:41:22,109 --> 01:41:25,272
Don't lecture me.
Go and sit there. Go!

1006
01:41:37,324 --> 01:41:40,293
- What are You doing?
- l am plaYing marbles.

1007
01:41:40,461 --> 01:41:42,326
Which one should l hit?

01:41:42,963 --> 01:41:43,895
Black.

1009
01:41:47,968 --> 01:41:51,927
- PlaY marbles!
- So what if l missed once?

1010
01:41:52,172 --> 01:41:55,869
''When l was Your age,
l never missed target. ''

1011
01:41:56,910 --> 01:42:02,212
- You know to plaY marbles?
- PlaY? l was a champion.

1012
01:42:03,851 --> 01:42:05,216
''No, You are fibbing. ''

1013
01:42:05,853 --> 01:42:09,220
''lf You reallY were a champion,
let's plaY. ''

1014
01:42:09,857 --> 01:42:12,223
''- Challenging me?
- Yes, let's have it!''

1015
01:42:15,896 --> 01:42:16,828
OkaY!

1016
01:42:20,901 --> 01:42:24,860
Give me.
One black and one white.

1017
01:42:26,306 --> 01:42:29,275
Now which one should l hit?
Black or white?

1018
01:42:29,409 --> 01:42:31,274
- The white one.
- OkaY.

1019
01:42:32,913 --> 01:42:35,279
''lf You miss, You'll have
to give me four marbles. ''

1020
01:42:35,415 --> 01:42:38,282
- And if l do hit?

1021
01:42:38,418 --> 01:42:41,876
''- Alright then.

01:42:42,923 --> 01:42:44,288

01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:50,327
l hit it!
Give me four marbles.

1024
01:42:54,902 --> 01:42:56,870
Four marbles in mY pocket!

1025
01:42:58,906 --> 01:43:01,807
''Take, now You plaY. ''

1026
01:43:08,248 --> 01:43:10,216
Which one do l hit?

1027
01:43:10,851 --> 01:43:15,220
Black... . . wait! How manY
will You give if You miss?

01:43:15,856 --> 01:43:17,221
l'll give You another four.

01:43:18,892 --> 01:43:23,829
You missed it!
Give me four more.

1030
01:44:18,852 --> 01:44:21,218
MY pocket is emptY!
Look.

1031
01:44:23,890 --> 01:44:24,822
Sir???

1032
01:44:27,894 --> 01:44:28,826
Keep it here.

1033
01:44:39,306 --> 01:44:41,866
Come and eat an apple.

1034
01:44:42,309 --> 01:44:44,869
l don't feel like eating.
MY mood got spoilt.

1035
01:44:46,913 --> 01:44:48,278
''Just because You lost,
it spoilt Your mood?''

1036
01:44:48,915 --> 01:44:51,884
How was l to know You
are trulY a champion?

1037
01:44:52,319 --> 01:44:54,219
l thought You
were fibbing like me.

1038
01:44:56,256 --> 01:44:59,225
''You cut mY pocket, now
cut an apple and give me. ''

1039
01:44:59,393 --> 01:45:00,257
Cut it Yourself.

1040
01:45:00,827 --> 01:45:03,193
''lf l cut, l'll cut mY hand.
lf that happens, l'll bleed. ''

1041
01:45:03,330 --> 01:45:06,766
''lf l bleed, l'll have to go to
the doctor. He will inject me. ''

1042
01:45:06,967 --> 01:45:08,195
- lf he injects... . .
- Enough... . enough!

1043
01:45:08,835 --> 01:45:11,804
Your tongue moves verY fast.

1044
01:45:12,239 --> 01:45:17,802
''What do l do, sir? MY legs don't
run fast, so mY tongue does. ''

1045
01:45:22,849 --> 01:45:24,214
''What are You watching, sir?''

1046
01:45:25,852 --> 01:45:30,221
l am watching in what
waYs God tests people.

1047
01:45:32,893 --> 01:45:35,828
''Take, eat. ''

1048
01:45:36,897 --> 01:45:38,831
''- You also eat one piece.
- No, You eat. ''

1049
01:45:39,099 --> 01:45:41,033
WhY are You showing off
just because You won?

1050
01:45:52,913 --> 01:45:57,873
Sit here and eat.
Keep this here. Come.

1051
01:46:04,891 --> 01:46:05,823
Eat.

1052
01:46:18,905 --> 01:46:21,271
Rahul in Your lap
looks so good.

1053
01:46:23,910 --> 01:46:27,869
''lf he was alive todaY,
even he'd be as old as Rahul. ''

1054
01:46:28,915 --> 01:46:30,883
And would plaY in
Your lap just like this.

1055
01:46:31,318 --> 01:46:34,287
''AuntY, was there a
child in Your house too?''

1056
01:46:35,922 --> 01:46:38,288
''- Yes, son.
- Where is he now?''

1057
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:44,897
God called him to His own
house before he could come here.

1058
01:46:45,966 --> 01:46:47,900
''Forget the past, Preeti. ''

1059
01:46:48,969 --> 01:46:52,336
Remembering it onlY hurts.

1060
01:46:52,973 --> 01:46:55,271
''Yes auntY, sir is right. ''

1061
01:46:55,909 --> 01:46:57,877
Remembering the past onlY hurts.

1062
01:46:58,912 --> 01:47:02,848
''When mY papa remembers mom,
even he feels verY hurt. ''

1063
01:47:20,300 --> 01:47:22,268
'Did You love onlY Your wife?'

1064
01:47:27,908 --> 01:47:30,877
''Neither could
anYone enter mY heart''

1065
01:47:31,912 --> 01:47:34,881
''Nor could l take
anYone in mY arms''

1066
01:47:35,916 --> 01:47:38,885
''Even after leaving me, it was
onlY You who was alwaYs with me''

1067
01:47:39,119 --> 01:47:44,887
''O mY darling, mY beloved''

1068
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:48,325
Do You know that

1069
01:48:22,896 --> 01:48:24,261
'''WhY did she leave You''

1070
01:48:30,904 --> 01:48:34,271
WhY You left me

1071
01:48:35,909 --> 01:48:38,275
''You know better,
what do l saY''

1072
01:48:39,913 --> 01:48:42,279
''l maY have had
some shortcoming''

1073
01:48:43,917 --> 01:48:46,886
WhY should l blame You

1074
01:48:47,921 --> 01:48:54,258
''l will onlY saY this
whenever You ask me''

1075
01:49:03,837 --> 01:49:07,204
''Even after leaving me, ... . ''

1076
01:49:32,899 --> 01:49:34,833
'Will You spend all
Your life like that?'

1077
01:49:41,308 --> 01:49:48,271
''You have given me
a beautiful memento''

1078
01:49:49,316 --> 01:49:52,285
l will spend mY life... .

1079
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:56,218
... hugging him close to me

1080
01:49:57,891 --> 01:50:04,262
''l will onlY saY this,
whenever You ask me''

1081
01:50:13,907 --> 01:50:17,274
Even after leaving me... .

1082
01:50:57,317 --> 01:50:58,284
You?

1083
01:51:03,857 --> 01:51:05,825
You were skating bY Yourself?

1084
01:51:06,292 --> 01:51:09,227
''Rahul was not here,
so l was getting bored. ''

1085
01:51:09,896 --> 01:51:11,830
Even he doesn't like
it without You.

1086
01:51:12,298 --> 01:51:15,267
''We told him to dine with us,
but he didn't agree. ''

1087
01:51:15,902 --> 01:51:19,269
''Rahul, You didn't trouble
Preeti or her father, did You?''

1088
01:51:19,406 --> 01:51:22,864
''- No, papa.
- He was no trouble at all. ''

1089
01:51:23,109 --> 01:51:26,272
l was thinking of taking
him home everY evening.

1090
01:51:26,913 --> 01:51:30,280
''Don't encourage the
relationship, Preeti. ''

1091
01:51:30,917 --> 01:51:33,886
lf he gets used to
living in mansions... .

1092
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:36,083
... he will forget his
poor father's humble house.

1093
01:51:36,322 --> 01:51:39,291
''Papa, forget all that,
l am hungrY. ''

1094
01:51:39,459 --> 01:51:41,324
Dinner is readY.
Come.

1095
01:51:41,961 --> 01:51:44,327
''- Goodnight, Preeti.
- What goodnight?''

1096
01:51:44,464 --> 01:51:46,329
AuntY will dine with us.

1097
01:51:48,968 --> 01:51:51,334
''Papa, if the food cooked
is not enough, l'll eat less. ''

1098
01:51:51,971 --> 01:51:54,269
But it will be bad manners... .

1099
01:51:54,908 --> 01:51:58,867
l didn't invite her because l
thought she maY not like our food.

1100
01:51:59,312 --> 01:52:02,213
l like all kinds of food.

1101
01:52:02,849 --> 01:52:05,215
- Then come in.
- Come.

1102
01:52:10,256 --> 01:52:11,223
Come.

1103
01:52:17,897 --> 01:52:20,832
This third plate?
ls someone expected?

1104
01:52:21,301 --> 01:52:23,861
That's for mY mother.
The chair and the plate.

1105
01:52:24,104 --> 01:52:26,265
''When mom comes,
she will sit there and eat. ''

1106
01:52:26,906 --> 01:52:29,875
''-With us! Right, papa?
-WhY do You ask again and again?''

1107
01:52:30,043 --> 01:52:31,271
She will sit when she comes.

1108
01:52:31,911 --> 01:52:35,278
But You can sit here.
l like You.

1109
01:52:35,415 --> 01:52:37,883
But l don't like it
when TickY sits there.

1110
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:43,881
''- Sit down, auntY.
- Ask Your papa first. ''

1111
01:52:44,958 --> 01:52:48,894
''What is there to ask? lf You
want to please Rahul, sit down. ''

1112
01:52:49,362 --> 01:52:50,294
Or suit Yourself.

1113
01:53:01,841 --> 01:53:03,809
''- Preeti hasn't come Yet?
- No, sir. ''

1114
01:53:20,894 --> 01:53:23,260
You reallY cook verY well.

1115
01:53:23,897 --> 01:53:26,263
MY helplessness has
taught me manY things.

1116
01:53:26,900 --> 01:53:27,832
This is one of them.

1117
01:53:28,301 --> 01:53:32,260
''AuntY, will You have 'paan'.
We get verY good 'paan' here. ''

1118
01:53:32,906 --> 01:53:34,874
- Shall l get it?
- Get it.

1119
01:53:35,308 --> 01:53:37,868
- Banarasi or Calcutta?
- AnY will do.

1120
01:53:38,044 --> 01:53:39,477
- But sweet.
- OkaY.

1121
01:53:39,913 --> 01:53:43,280
l know which papa likes.
He likes Banarasi 'paan'.

1122
01:53:59,899 --> 01:54:03,198
''- Let me help You.
- No, You are a guest... . . ''

1123
01:54:03,436 --> 01:54:06,200
... from a rich familY.
Poor people do such chores.

1124
01:54:15,849 --> 01:54:21,810
''Prem, You made
tall claims of love. ''

1125
01:54:22,856 --> 01:54:24,221
Then whY did You get married?

1126
01:54:25,291 --> 01:54:27,816
ln celebration of the
success of mY first love.

1127
01:54:28,895 --> 01:54:30,829
And whY did she leave You?

1128
01:54:31,297 --> 01:54:33,231
ln celebration of mY
first love's loYaltY.

1129
01:54:33,900 --> 01:54:38,860
Don't trY to act smart. SaY that
You failed to blackmail even her.

1130
01:54:39,906 --> 01:54:42,272
Even her father must have
refused to give You moneY.

1131
01:54:42,508 --> 01:54:44,066
So You had to come
and live in a hut.

1132
01:54:44,911 --> 01:54:46,276
Am l right?

1133
01:54:47,914 --> 01:54:50,280
''You are verY smart,
You know everything. ''

1134
01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:56,218
Wish l knew all this
before meeting You.

1135
01:54:57,891 --> 01:54:59,825
That's what is
not in man's hands.

1136
01:55:00,260 --> 01:55:02,751
''Until You meet a person,
You never know him. ''

1137
01:55:03,229 --> 01:55:06,164
lf You had got to know me or
l had got to know You before...

1138
01:55:06,332 --> 01:55:07,765
... whY would
matters reach here?

1139
01:55:08,835 --> 01:55:11,804
What do You intend to do now?
Ruin a third life?

1140
01:55:13,239 --> 01:55:15,799
''You onlY tell me,
how can l change mY habit. ''

1141
01:55:16,242 --> 01:55:19,803
''lt's a famous saYing,
'habits die hard'. ''

1142
01:55:21,848 --> 01:55:23,816
Who is that third
unfortunate girl?

1143
01:55:27,854 --> 01:55:31,221
No! She's onlY a kid.
VerY much Younger than me.

1144
01:55:31,491 --> 01:55:34,221
''And then, she is Your
future husband's sister. ''

1145
01:55:34,894 --> 01:55:38,830
That will be too close.
l cannot take the risk.

1146
01:55:40,900 --> 01:55:42,868
But Dr. Amar
has a lot of moneY.

1147
01:55:43,303 --> 01:55:45,271
You can ask for
as much as You want.

1148
01:55:45,905 --> 01:55:48,874
Good You told me.

1149
01:55:49,909 --> 01:55:53,276
Now also tell me
how much l should demand.

1150
01:55:54,914 --> 01:55:56,279
''How much You demanded
from mY father, ... ''

1151
01:55:56,416 --> 01:55:57,883
... . l'm sure
You'll get that much.

1152
01:55:59,919 --> 01:56:01,216
MoneY from Your father?

1153
01:56:01,854 --> 01:56:03,822
WhY?
Don't You remember?

1154
01:56:09,896 --> 01:56:12,831
Read Your letter and
You'll remember everything.

1155
01:56:18,905 --> 01:56:22,272
'''Preeti, You are aware
that l am not rich'''

1156
01:56:22,909 --> 01:56:26,868
'Whatever l did with
You was for moneY'

1157
01:56:27,914 --> 01:56:30,280
Now perhaps You will want to saY
that You didn't write this letter.

1158
01:56:30,516 --> 01:56:31,483
But l... . .

1159
01:56:31,918 --> 01:56:34,284
'l promise before
You all todaY... . '

1160
01:56:34,520 --> 01:56:37,887
'... that until l cure
Rahul's handicap... . '

1161
01:56:38,958 --> 01:56:40,323
'... l will not get married'

1162
01:56:41,961 --> 01:56:45,328
''Please Prem, saY that You
didn't write this letter. ''

1163
01:56:45,465 --> 01:56:48,901
The man who can sacrifice his
happiness for Your son...

1164
01:56:49,168 --> 01:56:52,331
... will You snatch
his happiness from him?

1165
01:56:52,972 --> 01:56:56,874
''No Prem, saY You
onlY wrote this letter. ''

1166
01:56:58,911 --> 01:57:01,209
This is the first opportunitY
l've got to speak the truth.

1167
01:57:01,848 --> 01:57:03,213
So how can l lie?

1168
01:57:04,851 --> 01:57:07,820
- l wrote this letter.
- You scoundrel! Rogue!

1169
01:57:08,855 --> 01:57:11,221
lt is mY misfortune
that l loved You.

1170
01:57:15,895 --> 01:57:20,264
And l am fortunate that the
hatred l was waiting for...

1171
01:57:20,400 --> 01:57:21,833
... l got it todaY.

1172
01:57:22,035 --> 01:57:26,870
You are insolent!
But don't think You have won.

1173
01:57:27,306 --> 01:57:29,866
''Like me, even You
are cheating Yourself. ''

1174
01:57:30,309 --> 01:57:33,278
But l can read Your face.

1175
01:57:33,913 --> 01:57:35,881
You love me even todaY.

1176
01:57:36,315 --> 01:57:38,875
You sing the song You
had for me even todaY.

1177
01:57:39,318 --> 01:57:42,879
You have also taught
Your son the same song.

1178
01:57:43,523 --> 01:57:47,289
''Prem, You are lYing. ''

1179
01:57:47,960 --> 01:57:52,329
You love onlY me.
Just me! Me!

1180
01:57:52,465 --> 01:57:55,263
- No! That's not true!
- lt is true!

1181
01:57:55,902 --> 01:57:58,268
Swear on Your child
and saY You don't love me.

1182
01:58:10,850 --> 01:58:16,811
l swear on Rahul that l have
onlY loved Rahul's mother.

1183
01:58:17,857 --> 01:58:18,824
And nobodY else.

1184
01:58:31,304 --> 01:58:34,273
''Papa, whY did auntY
leave like that?''

1185
01:58:35,908 --> 01:58:37,273
That's not surprising.

1186
01:58:38,911 --> 01:58:43,871
Your auntY alwaYs
comes to go back again.

1187
01:58:44,917 --> 01:58:46,282
OnlY to go back.

1188
01:58:58,297 --> 01:58:59,229
Lift Your legs.

1189
01:59:00,833 --> 01:59:03,199
l think we should
start phYsiotherapY too.

1190
01:59:03,836 --> 01:59:05,201
Which we alreadY have.

1191
01:59:05,838 --> 01:59:08,204
Now l am starting
another line of treatment.

1192
01:59:09,842 --> 01:59:11,810
And then l'll go
for psYcho-therapY.

1193
01:59:13,446 --> 01:59:15,812
The case seems difficult.

1194
01:59:16,849 --> 01:59:18,817
''Yes, it is difficult,
that is whY l have decided... ''

1195
01:59:19,252 --> 01:59:23,211
''... that until l cure him,
l won't get married. ''

1196
01:59:23,856 --> 01:59:27,223
What connection does his
treatment have with Your marriage?

1197
01:59:27,493 --> 01:59:30,257
''Don't worrY, doctor.
l'll be cured soon. ''

1198
01:59:30,496 --> 01:59:32,862
And doctor uncle will
also get married soon.

1199
01:59:35,902 --> 01:59:37,870
''BY the waY, who are
You getting married to?''

1200
01:59:39,305 --> 01:59:41,865
''Amar, Rahul's latest
X-raY reports show... ... ''

1201
01:59:50,917 --> 01:59:52,885
- You know her?
- VerY well.

1202
01:59:53,119 --> 01:59:54,814
She was mY student in Shimla.

1203
01:59:55,855 --> 01:59:58,221
''Preeti, did You marrY that guY?''

1204
01:59:59,892 --> 02:00:02,258
l... . . no.

1205
02:00:02,895 --> 02:00:07,832
But You said he was readY.
Who retracted?

1206
02:00:09,902 --> 02:00:11,870
Both of us.

1207
02:00:20,913 --> 02:00:22,881
''Nice girl, but unfortunatelY... ''

1208
02:00:27,920 --> 02:00:29,285
What tragedY?

1209
02:00:30,923 --> 02:00:32,288
She was going to marrY someone?

1210
02:00:32,959 --> 02:00:34,893
''Doctor, patient number 31
has regained consciousness. ''

1211
02:00:35,094 --> 02:00:36,026
He's wants to see You.

1212
02:00:38,965 --> 02:00:40,330
''You staY here, l'll just come. ''

1213
02:00:44,971 --> 02:00:48,930
There is no need to worrY.
Just continue with the exercises.

1214
02:00:49,175 --> 02:00:50,540
''lt will take some time,
but everything will be alright. ''

1215
02:00:51,577 --> 02:00:53,135
These are the injections
You asked me to get.

1216
02:00:53,379 --> 02:00:55,279
''Sit in mY office, l am coming. ''

1217
02:00:56,916 --> 02:01:00,249
Continue with these
medicines until l tell You.

1218
02:01:15,901 --> 02:01:17,869
You?
Even You are here?

1219
02:01:18,304 --> 02:01:21,273
Yes. MY son Rahul is
taking his treatment here.

1220
02:01:24,910 --> 02:01:26,878
That means You
married someone else.

1221
02:01:27,913 --> 02:01:28,880
Yes.

1222
02:01:38,958 --> 02:01:40,289
She is no more.

1223
02:01:46,966 --> 02:01:50,925
Nothing is lost Yet.
Rahul needs a mother.

1224
02:01:52,371 --> 02:01:53,929
WhY don't You marrY Preeti?

1225
02:01:54,307 --> 02:01:57,276
Please don't connect
mY name with Preeti.

1226
02:02:00,846 --> 02:02:03,815
'The storY which You
cannot conclude'

1227
02:02:04,250 --> 02:02:06,810
'lt is better to give it
a new turn and leave it'

1228
02:02:21,901 --> 02:02:26,861
''Doctor, l would like to know
something about Preeti from You. ''

1229
02:02:27,907 --> 02:02:29,875
l hope You will
tell me the truth.

1230
02:02:44,924 --> 02:02:47,290
''Prem, that doctor
from Shimla is here. ''

1231
02:02:48,361 --> 02:02:49,885
''Yes, l met him. ''

1232
02:02:50,363 --> 02:02:51,887
Had You told him something?

1233
02:02:52,365 --> 02:02:53,889
Yes. Everything.

1234
02:02:54,900 --> 02:02:58,267
He was talking about us
in Amar's presence.

1235
02:02:58,904 --> 02:03:00,804
And now l think Amar
has become suspicious.

1236
02:03:05,244 --> 02:03:06,802
What will happen now?

1237
02:03:17,857 --> 02:03:18,824
Mom!

1238
02:03:21,894 --> 02:03:25,261
''ln GermanY, l was
injecting a child like this. ''

1239
02:03:25,898 --> 02:03:27,832
His mother was
standing besides me.

1240
02:03:28,901 --> 02:03:32,268
And even she had
scowled like You did.

1241
02:03:32,905 --> 02:03:35,271
What are You trYing to saY?
That l am his mother?

1242
02:03:35,908 --> 02:03:37,273
l didn't saY that.

1243
02:03:39,311 --> 02:03:41,871
''No uncle, don't give
me another injection. ''

1244
02:03:42,114 --> 02:03:43,274
lt hurts.

1245
02:03:43,516 --> 02:03:47,282
''Dr. Amar, the potencY of this
injection is higher. ''

1246
02:03:47,920 --> 02:03:49,888
When he could not bear the
pain of the earlier injection...

1247
02:03:50,122 --> 02:03:54,821
Rahul is mY patient. What he
can or cannot take is mY job.

1248
02:03:55,094 --> 02:03:56,857
''lf You cannot bear to see him,
You can go out. ''

1249
02:03:57,897 --> 02:03:59,262
''Mr. Prem, You also go out. ''

1250
02:03:59,398 --> 02:04:02,196
''And no matter what happens
here, don't come inside. ''

1251
02:04:02,435 --> 02:04:03,367
And shut the door behind You.

1252
02:04:03,502 --> 02:04:05,800
''No, he is mY papa,
let him staY here. ''

1253
02:04:06,238 --> 02:04:07,796
''This is not Your house,
it is a hospital. ''

1254
02:04:07,973 --> 02:04:11,204
- Papa!
- Just lie down quietlY!

1255
02:04:11,444 --> 02:04:13,207
''No uncle, this hurts. ''

1256
02:04:13,846 --> 02:04:17,213
''Shut-up! You hold his feet,
and You, his hands. ''

1257
02:04:17,450 --> 02:04:18,815
No!... no!

1258
02:04:23,856 --> 02:04:24,823
You hit me?

1259
02:04:25,891 --> 02:04:28,257
''You hit me,
l will not staY here. ''

1260
02:04:29,895 --> 02:04:32,830
''Papa, take me awaY!
l don't want to staY here. ''

1261
02:04:33,032 --> 02:04:35,262
You'll have to staY here.
Let me see where You go!

1262
02:04:35,401 --> 02:04:36,868
l want to go to papa.

1263
02:04:39,905 --> 02:04:42,271
l will go to mom and papa.

1264
02:04:43,909 --> 02:04:47,868
''You cannot walk,
how will You go to Your papa?''

1265
02:04:55,855 --> 02:04:58,824
''Papa, take me awaY.
He beat me!''

1266
02:05:06,832 --> 02:05:11,792
''- Papa, doctor uncle beat me.
- l know, son. ''

1267
02:05:20,846 --> 02:05:23,212
Can l ask whY You
treated Rahul like that?

1268
02:05:23,849 --> 02:05:26,818
Can l ask You Dr. Preeti
whY You treated me like that?

1269
02:05:29,255 --> 02:05:33,214
l know Dr. Saxena
has told You everything.

1270
02:05:33,893 --> 02:05:36,828
Even l wanted to tell You
everything before the engagement.

1271
02:05:37,897 --> 02:05:39,262
But mY father stopped me.

1272
02:05:39,899 --> 02:05:41,264
But how is Rahul
connected with that?

1273
02:05:41,901 --> 02:05:45,860
When did l saY Rahul
is connected to this?

1274
02:05:46,105 --> 02:05:48,266
Then whY did You vent Your
anger on that innocent kid?

1275
02:05:48,908 --> 02:05:51,274
You onlY saw mY temper.

1276
02:05:51,911 --> 02:05:54,880
''You didn't see that
because of that temper, ... . ''

1277
02:05:55,047 --> 02:05:57,277
... Rahul walked four steps.

1278
02:05:58,918 --> 02:06:01,819
''TodaY he walked four steps,
tomorrow he'll walk fortY. ''

1279
02:06:02,054 --> 02:06:06,821
''Then he will run, and one daY,
he will skate like his father. ''

1280
02:06:07,293 --> 02:06:12,526
''Dr. Preeti, l regret to saY that
You are more of a woman... . ''

1281
02:06:12,898 --> 02:06:14,832
... than a doctor.

1282
02:06:15,301 --> 02:06:18,270
Rahul is onlY a patient for me.

1283
02:06:18,904 --> 02:06:21,873
''For You, Rahul is Prem's son.
That Prem's son... . . ''

1284
02:06:22,041 --> 02:06:24,874
... who gave You his bodY
heat and saved Your life.

1285
02:06:37,923 --> 02:06:43,327
Come. Even You have come
to saY whY l beat Rahul?

1286
02:06:43,963 --> 02:06:46,898
WhY l vent mY anger
on an innocent child?

1287
02:06:47,967 --> 02:06:49,935
WhY l treated him so badlY?

1288
02:07:04,850 --> 02:07:05,817
What are You doing!

1289
02:07:06,251 --> 02:07:09,220
l know what You
did was necessarY.

1290
02:07:09,355 --> 02:07:11,414
lt was a part of Your treatment.

1291
02:07:12,291 --> 02:07:15,226
MY son Rahul walked todaY.
Walked four steps.

1292
02:07:15,894 --> 02:07:18,021
He will walk more tomorrow.
Then he will run.

1293
02:07:18,297 --> 02:07:19,821
Then he will be able
to skate like me.

1294
02:07:20,099 --> 02:07:22,863
''You have made this
possible, doctor. ''

1295
02:07:23,102 --> 02:07:25,263
''l have no words to
thank You, doctor!''

1296
02:07:27,906 --> 02:07:31,865
You don't have to thank me.
You can take Rahul home now.

1297
02:07:32,911 --> 02:07:36,278
Keep drumming into him that
his legs are getting better.

1298
02:07:36,915 --> 02:07:39,281
And make him practice
to walk without crutches.

1299
02:07:39,918 --> 02:07:42,284
And bring him here
for check-up once a week.

1300
02:07:42,921 --> 02:07:43,888
''Yes, doctor. ''

1301
02:07:44,923 --> 02:07:48,882
''But doctor, l want to
discuss about Preeti and me... ''

1302
02:07:49,361 --> 02:07:53,923
''Mr. Prem, You can discuss Rahul
and his treatment with me. ''

1303
02:07:54,099 --> 02:07:56,260
l don't want to discuss
anything apart from that.

1304
02:08:08,847 --> 02:08:10,212
What happened to Your finger?

1305
02:08:10,849 --> 02:08:12,214
l cut it while cooking.

1306
02:08:12,351 --> 02:08:15,218
WhY were You cooking?
Are the servants on leave?

1307
02:08:15,354 --> 02:08:18,812
''No, but l want
to learn to cook. ''

1308
02:08:19,291 --> 02:08:23,227
''Because the familY l'm going to
get married into, has no servants. ''

1309
02:08:24,897 --> 02:08:26,831
No servants?
ln whose familY?

1310
02:08:27,299 --> 02:08:28,231
Master's!

1311
02:08:32,905 --> 02:08:33,872
Yes.

1312
02:08:34,039 --> 02:08:35,267
''So this time,
he is making You his preY. ''

1313
02:08:35,908 --> 02:08:37,876
He doesn't even talk to me.

1314
02:08:38,310 --> 02:08:40,870
But l know he loves me.

1315
02:08:41,914 --> 02:08:43,882
''TickY, You know he is married?''

1316
02:08:44,116 --> 02:08:46,141
''He is the father of one child,
double Your age... . ''

1317
02:08:46,318 --> 02:08:47,285
So what?

1318
02:08:47,419 --> 02:08:49,284
He has plaYed this
act manY times before.

1319
02:08:49,922 --> 02:08:52,288
''And this time again,

He first
snatched Preeti from me.

02:08:58,897 --> 02:09:01,195
Now he wants
to snatch mY sister.

''Alright, l'll wait. ''

He's gone to meet the new girl.

02:18:29,469 --> 02:18:31,588
Papa I'll take you.

1355
02:18:31,660 --> 02:18:33,422
Daddy Daddy

There is fire everywhere,

1357
02:18:37,584 --> 02:18:38,422
Daddy

1358
02:18:53,281 --> 02:18:55,957
Rahul, Rahul

1359
02:18:56,028 --> 02:18:59,766
Daddy goes up from there.

1360

Daddy, push.

Daddy, push hard, Daddy

1362
02:19:28,410 --> 02:19:29,447
Push, Daddy

1363
02:19:56,735 --> 02:20:01,750
All the joys of my life depend
on this operation.

1364
02:20:01,751 --> 02:20:09,820
Of life or death of Prem.

1365
02:20:13,281 --> 02:20:14,852
Take the patient to the table.

1366
02:20:27,190 --> 02:20:28,028
Daddy

1367
02:20:28,298 --> 02:20:29,402
My son

1368
02:20:30,359 --> 02:20:31,396
How are you?

1369
02:20:36,214 --> 02:20:37,318
Look, Rahul.

1370
02:20:38,928 --> 02:20:42,420
This purse is the picture
of your mother.

1371
02:20:44,424 --> 02:20:45,728
If I do not leave this room...

1372
02:20:45,797 --> 02:20:51,028
... then grab it and you
go to your mother.

1373
02:20:51,161 --> 02:20:52,956
I go with you.

1374
02:20:53,026 --> 02:20:54,553
I want Daddy.

1375
02:20:59,749 --> 02:21:03,478
And you do not want the mother?

1376
02:21:03,740 --> 02:21:04,811
I also want the mother.

1377
02:21:04,841 --> 02:21:06,337
I want both Mom and Dad.

1378
02:21:09,894 --> 02:21:12,263
No son, you can not have both.

1379
02:21:12,394 --> 02:21:14,324
That is their destiny.

1380
02:21:15,272 --> 02:21:16,149
You will have the
mother or father.

1381
02:21:17,782 --> 02:21:18,467
So I want Daddy, not Mommy.

1382
02:21:28,309 --> 02:21:29,412
Go son.

1383
02:21:29,413 --> 02:21:31,946
Now let me go.

1384
02:21:33,183 --> 02:21:34,045
No Daddy, do not let go.

1385
02:21:34,178 --> 02:21:35,806
No Daddy, do not let go.

1386
02:21:35,944 --> 02:21:37,754
Daddy Daddy, Daddy I
want to go with you.

1387
02:21:37,755 --> 02:21:39,956
Daddy let me go, Daddy

1388
02:21:40,093 --> 02:21:42,769
I want to go with you.
Let me go.

1389
02:21:42,939 --> 02:21:45,158
Let me go, Papal

1390
02:21:45,587 --> 02:21:50,428
I want to go with you.
Let me go.

1391
02:21:50,494 --> 02:21:52,423
Daddy

1392
02:21:59,882 --> 02:22:06,451
Oh, my son... "

1393
02:22:08,392 --> 02:22:15,999
"Listen to what they say... "

1394
02:22:16,923 --> 02:22:24,797
"Even if you're sad... "

1395
02:22:25,329 --> 02:22:33,102
"Keep laughing... "

1396
02:22:59,332 --> 02:23:04,019
"Always have faith. . "

1397
02:23:04,154 --> 02:23:09,841
"Him who created us all... "

1398
02:23:10,401 --> 02:23:14,751
"Your daddy can not be
there tomorrow... "

1399
02:23:15,863 --> 02:23:21,617
"He can not say what
he said right now!"

1400
02:23:21,884 --> 02:23:24,493
"Remember what I said... "

1401
02:23:24,563 --> 02:23:27,497
"He is the Savior... "

1402
02:23:27,638 --> 02:23:30,604
"Simply just call him... "

1403
02:23:31,432 --> 02:23:35,346
"Come, come... "

1404
02:23:36,600 --> 02:23:39,510
"Oh, my son... "

1405
02:23:40,689 --> 02:23:44,314
"Listen to what they say... "

1406
02:23:45,170 --> 02:23:48,470
"Even if you're sad... "

1407
02:23:49,585 --> 02:23:53,043
"Keep laughing... "

1408
02:24:08,786 --> 02:24:10,022
Whose bag is this?

1409
02:24:12,056 --> 02:24:14,718
It is my Dad.

1410
02:24:14,823 --> 02:24:16,808
Here is a photo of my mother.

1411
02:24:56,840 --> 02:24:57,910
Rahul

1412
02:24:58,965 --> 02:25:00,068
My son?

1413
02:25:01,746 --> 02:25:05,660
Rahul! My son! My Boy!

1414
02:25:05,736 --> 02:25:06,772
My son!

1415
02:25:13,964 --> 02:25:17,588
Daddy, you told me I had
a stillborn baby.

1416
02:25:18,020 --> 02:25:20,782
So how is that Rahul is my son?

1417
02:25:24,676 --> 02:25:25,645
I lied.

1418
02:25:27,421 --> 02:25:29,439
Rahul is his son.

1419
02:25:29,515 --> 02:25:30,551
Forgive me, daughter.

1420
02:25:30,660 --> 02:25:33,659
Never.
- I'll never forgive.

1421
02:25:33,766 --> 02:25:35,428
I never forgive.

1422
02:26:09,386 --> 02:26:11,372
You killed him intentionally.

1423
02:26:11,479 --> 02:26:14,289
You never wanted us to
meet this incarnation.

1424
02:26:15,536 --> 02:26:19,394
But if you do not have the Prem, at
least I have a recollection of him.

1425
02:26:20,540 --> 02:26:22,201
Rahul is my son.

1426
02:26:22,339 --> 02:26:25,014
I will live my life for him...

1427
02:26:25,086 --> 02:26:27,138
... but I'll never be yours.

1428
02:26:27,139 --> 02:26:28,054
You hear me?
I'll never be yours.

1429
02:26:28,124 --> 02:26:30,320
Wretch! Traitor non...

1430
02:26:30,363 --> 02:26:31,485
Stop it now.

1431
02:26:34,065 --> 02:26:38,003
After a successful operation,
I received flowers...

1432
02:26:38,071 --> 02:26:41,634
... Praise, mounds of cash or
sometimes immense love... "

1433
02:26:43,412 --> 02:26:46,007
"But a blow is something I
get for the first time...

1434
02:26:46,083 --> 02:26:48,177
... in my life.

1435
02:26:48,720 --> 02:26:51,087
And that too after a
successful operation.

1436
02:26:53,593 --> 02:26:59,398
Yes, Prem...
their Prem... Yes.

1437
02:27:09,417 --> 02:27:16,053
Prem! Prem!

1438
02:27:22,703 --> 02:27:26,071
"Look, now is not lost... "

1439
02:27:26,209 --> 02:27:30,237
"Never again to separate... "

1440
02:27:31,349 --> 02:27:35,082
"Now both will be together
like that!"

1441
02:27:35,222 --> 02:27:39,661
"That's the promise tonight... "

1442
02:27:39,728 --> 02:27:46,694
"Whether you know it or not... "

1443
02:27:48,107 --> 02:27:55,073
"Whether you believe
it or not... "

1444
02:27:57,053 --> 02:28:02,049
"You have a prior relationship
with me... "

1445
02:28:02,194 --> 02:28:06,155
"Ma person does not become so dear
to the heart just like that... "

1446
02:28:06,267 --> 02:28:10,330
"You have a prior relationship
with me... "

1447
02:28:10,506 --> 02:28:14,410
"A person does not become so dear
to the heart just like that... "

1448
02:28:14,545 --> 02:28:23,253
"Whether you know it or not... "

1449
02:28:23,392 --> 02:28:31,531
"Whether you believe
it or not... "
