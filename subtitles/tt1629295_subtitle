1
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,726
<i>An,</i>

2
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,004
Sorry, I'm late.

3
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,527
No, it's Ok. The
doctor's not here, as yet.

4
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,611
Excuse me, aren't you the donor?

5
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,009
Ok, you wait here.

6
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,845
I'll bring forms, then
you can donate, okay?

7
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,046
Sure.

8
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,320
It's rather warm.

9
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,763
You don't have to talk
if you don't want to.

10
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,651
Careful.

11
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,086
Me you Ok?

12
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,082
It's not a toy madam! It
will change our whole life.

13
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,446
IT!

14
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,803
He will throw you out of
the house in your old age"

15
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,530
...if you refer to the child as 'it'.

16
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,927
Ok. But after a child is born,
our whole life will change.

17
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,126
So?

18
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,808
So! It's a big decision,
it can't he taken in haste.

19
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,325
Look at Nishikant.

20
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,971
He can't survive a
moment without Payal.

21
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,409
Do you recall how many fights
he had with Nita initially.

22
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,051
Same arguments.

23
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,562
You husbands are all alike!

24
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,681
Alright.

25
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,286
Look, it's your decision. Do
whatever feels right for you.

26
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,407
Oh? So this decision is
mine alone, not yours?

27
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:05,084
What about your career? And
how will you repay the loan?

28
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,250
Manav, we will regret
it if we wait any longer.

29
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,129
We will adopt. It's simple.

30
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,687
I really want us to
have our own baby.

31
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:23,282
I want to get pregnant and
enjoy every moment, please!

32
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,410
Manav! Are you listening?

33
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,001
What?

34
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,844
<i>What's wrung? Mia'.!</i>

35
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,046
Why not?

36
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,571
When did I say no?
Go ahead and do it.

37
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,681
I'm talking about having a BABY,
not buying a bloody refrigerator.

38
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,161
I'm sorry.

39
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,490
Why did you do that?

40
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,011
I love her.

41
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,371
I want a divorce.

42
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,003
Look, it's the right
thing to do I guess.

43
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,921
I can't leave her.

44
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,326
What!

45
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,880
I just can't.

46
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,486
This sari is really
gorgeous, isn't it?

47
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,161
<i>Mi a?</i>

48
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,406
What happened?

49
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,086
'I'm not ready',

50
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,130
and now in a year's
time, he is ready!

51
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,763
He kept lying to me
and I never got it.

52
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,842
I can't understand
why I trusted him.

53
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,811
What an idiot I am!

54
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,284
Sometimes things
happen for the best.

55
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,566
Please!

56
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,325
Life's not over.
You are still young.

57
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,361
I am never going to
trust another man,

58
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,566
...ever.

59
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,128
It's just not worth it!

60
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,841
You know what?

61
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,361
I'm going to have a baby on my own!

62
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,566
Yes...

63
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,486
What!

64
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,563
What is there to be so surprised?

65
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,487
You don't need a man
anymore to have a child.

66
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,967
Scientifically it's possible.

67
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,771
That's a very stupid idea.

68
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,046
No, it's not!

69
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,290
What's the guarantee
that the next man I meet,

70
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,725
won't be another Manav?

71
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,449
I don't want anybody any more.

72
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,290
It's too much of a risk.

73
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,122
If I can survive alone,

74
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,482
Then I can raise a
child too, all by myself.

75
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,201
<i>Mi a!</i>

76
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,406
Please.

77
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,926
Hello,

78
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,806
Yes Mother.

79
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,569
I am not at college.

80
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,764
I am out on some work with friends.

81
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,687
I shall speak with Dad later on.

82
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,364
Okay, bye.-

83
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,842
Mummy called, from Jamshedpur.

84
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,890
Oh! Didn't you call
her this morning?

85
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,282
I have to call them
every day. Three times.

86
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,371
How are your studies going?

87
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,329
I mean, when are your exams?

88
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,690
There is still time for them.

89
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,650
Every semester lasts
a year-and-a-half.

90
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,281
<i>Excuse me, you are M...</i>

91
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,441
<i>Mia Kidwai.</i>

92
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,601
Right.

93
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,241
This is for you.

94
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,606
Fill up everything.

95
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,886
And this is for you.

96
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,245
Isn't it your third time?

97
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,401
Yes.

98
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,121
Test reports?

99
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,010
I gave them to you the last time.

100
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,286
It's fine.

101
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,325
Did you fast for three days?

102
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,726
Yes.

103
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,961
Three days?

104
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,123
But why does he have
to fast for three days?

105
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,850
It's not that kind of fasting,

106
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,285
it's the OTHER kind.

107
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,801
It's mandatory before donation,

108
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,362
for the sperm count to be strong.

109
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,366
Excuse me.

110
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,290
Just a minute, I'm coming.

111
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,641
Aren't you going to read through it?

112
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,050
No, I have gone through it before.

113
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,450
It just states that

114
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,727
I won't have any
claim over the child,

115
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,202
or have any parental rights.

116
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,248
But if you wish to
meet the child anytime,

117
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,481
you are free to.

118
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,126
I mean if you desire.

119
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,329
No. That won't happen.

120
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,407
Once am done from here,

121
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,525
I won't meet you again.

122
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,441
Right.

123
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,601
<i>The Delhi High Court has ruled</i>

124
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,364
<i>That consensual sex
between homosexual adults...</i>

125
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,521
<i>Is legal.</i>

126
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,681
<i>The judgment...</i>

127
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,967
<i>The petitioners did not
expect in their lifetime.</i>

128
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,849
<i>The gate has opened</i>

129
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,082
I am too excited

130
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,048
But colour of eyes,

131
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,282
hair, height, education, that's all?

132
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,441
Won't I get to know any more?

133
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,931
We have done all the tests.

134
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,365
We make sure that we test up to

135
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,124
three generations for
any hereditary disorder.

136
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,770
Only then do we accept donors.

137
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,007
That's fine,

138
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,525
but what about his nature,

139
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,329
special talents

140
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,528
or any other qualities?

141
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,446
Then do you wish to ask
someone known to you, to donate?

142
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,721
A friend

143
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,961
or a friend's husband?

144
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,121
It's very simple.

145
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,326
He only has to just come here ,

146
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,084
we maintain absolute
confidentiality.

147
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,567
Honestly speaking,

148
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,085
I prefer documentaries.

149
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,011
Nothing shocks you after that.

150
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,690
Raw unadulterated people.

151
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,841
I love it.

152
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,811
Really!

153
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,530
So nothing can shock you?

154
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,000
I don't believe it.

155
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,881
Try me.

156
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,566
Ok.

157
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,723
I wish to be the
mother of your child.

158
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,646
What?

159
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,368
You are kidding?

160
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,680
No strings attached.

161
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,961
All you have to do is

162
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,042
To donate your sperm, that's it.

163
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,522
Well in that case,

164
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,045
I would rather do it
the conventional way.

165
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,201
Your place or mine?

166
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,887
How about a little cup
at the fertility clinic?

167
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,041
You got me there!

168
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,321
Well, now accept it

169
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,890
That you can still be shocked!

170
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,568
Okay, let's select the
pictures for your homepage.

171
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,690
May be this one?

172
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,164
If I select from one of your donors,

173
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,480
then can I meet him?

174
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,641
Afia it's not possible.

175
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,801
We don't allow that.

176
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,565
Then how do I find out
what sort of a person he is?

177
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,966
L...

178
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,246
I need a face.

179
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,841
Afia, I promise you, you
will get a healthy child.

180
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,407
Then it's up to you, how
the child will turn out.

181
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,244
The kind of
opportunities you'll give,

182
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,210
the way you choose to
bring up your child,

183
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,810
it's all about nurture.

184
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,970
I need some time.

185
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,246
Let me think about it.

186
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,846
Srinagar is finished.

187
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,206
It's over damn it!

188
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,050
Neither you, nor Ma or me,

189
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,690
no one will go back.

190
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,086
And that's final.

191
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,886
Siddharth!!!

192
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,570
Who will go hack to Kashmir?

193
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,483
Are they going to let us stay there?

194
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,724
Sell the house and finish matters.

195
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,801
But no,

196
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,802
no one is willing to listen.

197
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,928
Stop being such a control freak.

198
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,001
And I don't know what
to say to you either.

199
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,768
Doesn't the child need both parents?

200
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,048
Meaning, no woman has ever raised

201
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,009
a child alone before?

202
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,682
But that's not a happy situation!

203
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,806
No one wishes to be a single parent.

204
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,086
If you ask me,

205
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,810
you are being really selfish.

206
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,120
Then so be it!

207
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,051
I have decided.

208
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,730
And I think you are wrung.

209
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,565
Adopt one.

210
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,524
There are so many orphans.

211
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,684
Sure, adoption is great.

212
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,002
But why is it so difficult to accept

213
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,844
that I want to have my own child?

214
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,924
Why do I have to freakin...

215
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,131
why do I have to go
around convincing everybody

216
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,168
that I am not abnormal?

217
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,482
I'm tired of this.

218
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,326
Afia!

219
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:50,089
Megha will you ask Siddharth?

220
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,761
Please!

221
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,730
Afia he's my brother!

222
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,844
No one will know

223
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,331
except the three of us,

224
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,286
really!

225
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,091
I'm getting late.

226
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,606
I shall leave.

227
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,846
If life...

228
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,325
could he lived by oneself

229
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,766
then why feel

230
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,444
someone's absence.

231
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,886
Why should the dawn he a burden...

232
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,681
To the night

233
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:04,606
Come let's change the norms...

234
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:12,680
On this note.

235
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:21,331
On this note.

236
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:34,840
I never asked for the sky

237
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,082
But yes...

238
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,371
M least leave one window open.

239
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,486
Least the spirit to
overcome succumbs...

240
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,281
M some hurdle

241
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,286
Come let's change the norms...

242
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:05,360
On this note.

243
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:14,120
On this note.

244
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,246
If he is a medical student,

245
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,606
he will surely understand

246
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,569
Afia, even doctors have emotions

247
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,085
Please, just once.

248
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,400
I want to meet him once.

249
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,766
Afia that's not possible,

250
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,206
it's not possible.

251
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,684
Alright, I'll try another clinic.

252
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,046
Hold on,

253
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,245
let me try

254
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,006
and talk to him about this

255
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,241
Thank you.

256
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,567
<i>Surf]?</i>

257
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,402
Yes?

258
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,766
Hi, am Afia.

259
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,126
Hello.

260
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,641
Please sit.

261
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,840
Nice place,

262
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,811
this floatel.

263
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,003
Whose idea was this red T-shirt?

264
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,609
You could have come
with even a red rose!

265
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,209
But this red T-shirt in this heat!

266
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,169
Sorry I was just joking.

267
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,525
Thanks for meeting me

268
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,925
Before taking this decision,

269
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,809
it was necessary to meet you.

270
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,405
Well, it was not necessary.

271
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,365
All my medical tests are fine.

272
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,169
I have donated before...

273
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,961
I know,

274
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,405
but I just wanted to know

275
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,244
what kind of a person you are.

276
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,688
It's a big step for me,

277
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,611
I'm going to have a child from you.

278
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,729
So I needed to meet you
at least once, right?

279
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,011
Well, this isn't allowed.

280
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,645
I only agreed because the
doctor requested me to,

281
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,484
but you know this is wrong.

282
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,091
Just don't worry.

283
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,684
You see the form has
such basic information,

284
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,842
that it's all too inhuman.

285
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,607
I wanted to put a face to it.

286
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,730
It's really for me.

287
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,681
Okay.

288
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,446
The doctor mentioned that

289
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,851
you're a medical student.

290
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,406
Yes.

291
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,644
So what are your hobbies?

292
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,125
I have no time for them.

293
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:46,283
Ok. You must enjoy music?

294
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,642
Who doesn't enjoy music?

295
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,448
I mean, what kind
of music do you like?

296
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,641
Modern,

297
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,801
classical,

298
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,006
<i>'lit-Lu</i>

299
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,721
Old songs

300
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,006
from Hindi films.

301
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,681
Mohammad Rafi...

302
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,241
Right.

303
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,161
Look,

304
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,083
do you need to know anything else?

305
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,011
I'm getting late.

306
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,689
Who all do you have in your family?

307
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,250
Brother, sisters?

308
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,562
Why?

309
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,846
What's the relevance?

310
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,521
Sorry.

311
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,730
Do you wish to ask me anything?

312
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,361
No.

313
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,321
Dr. Basu strongly recommended you.

314
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,641
Look,

315
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,082
I really need to go somewhere.

316
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,407
I'm getting late.

317
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,891
Sure, sure.

318
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,726
The doctor will let you know

319
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,040
when you need to come

320
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,849
and really,

321
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,445
thanks a lot for meeting me.

322
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,851
Ok.

323
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,001
Bye.

324
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,361
Yes?

325
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,601
Yes sir.

326
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,171
They are here.

327
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,401
Right sir.

328
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,166
Doctor's coming.

329
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,921
Vasu, Vasu...

330
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,122
Yes?

331
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,361
Get him ready.

332
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,086
You go with him.

333
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,481
Please come, sir.

334
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,085
You please wait here.

335
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,484
Where's the restroom '.1

336
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,246
HI.

337
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,005
Just going to the loo.

338
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,126
Me you Ok?

339
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,131
Don't worry.

340
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,202
I know you have a good sperm count.

341
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,480
No,

342
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,844
what I mean is

343
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,445
things will be fine.

344
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,125
Thank you doctor.

345
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,246
Trust me.

346
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,204
Don't you believe me?

347
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,446
You're very young.

348
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,281
So?

349
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,609
What if am making a big mistake?

350
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,127
Well, you didn't need
to go through all this.

351
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,290
People would easily
fall in love with you.

352
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,568
Seriously, you are very beautiful.

353
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,930
You're a very kind boy.

354
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,690
By the way, what do you do?

355
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,286
Sorry if you don't want

356
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,646
No.

357
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,650
I am a web designer

358
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,051
WOW!

359
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,960
Listen,

360
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,246
how do I,

361
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,446
you know...

362
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,568
how do I compensate
you for all this?

363
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,566
You are paying the doctor.

364
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,201
Yeah, that I know...
but I would like to.

365
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,283
No please,

366
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,720

367
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,490
I am giving you my phone number

368
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,564
if you ever wish to meet me or...

369
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,130
Good afternoon doctor!

370
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,326
Good afternoon.

371
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,526
Hello.

372
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,522
How are you?
- Good afternoon sir.

373
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,726
Done?
- Yes sir.

374
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,881
You can go now.

375
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,007
Ok sir.

376
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,206
Come on Afia.

377
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,361
Please charge the laptop.

378
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,521
Yes sir.

379
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,640
Thanks a lot.

380
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,286
All the best.

381
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,691
To you too.

382
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,086
Bye then.

383
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,761
Bye.

384
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,321
You must go in,

385
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,129
Doc is waiting for you.

386
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,201
Afia are you ready?

387
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,370
Hey, stop. Stop ...Tolly gunj.

388
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,600
Greetings. We will shortly
arrive at Srinagar airport.

389
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,251
The temperature outside
is 15 degrees Celsius.

390
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,926
The seat hell: signs are on.

391
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,604
Keep your tray tables folded.

392
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,727
...keep your seats upright

393
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,042
and switch off
all electronic devices

394
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,090
The Indian government prohibits
photography during take off..

395
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,128
"And landing at army airports...

396
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,602
On behalf of Captain Nagpal and
Co-Captain Bindra and the crew

397
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,602
We hid you farewell.

398
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:05,844
We hope you had a pleasant flight
and thank you for traveling by Go-Air

399
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,610
It's been seven years...

400
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,570
...since they built this bridge

401
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,204
ls Little Hut still there?

402
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,851
Of course! You still remember?

403
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,650
How stupid of me!

404
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,530
We must have spent all
our pocket money there.

405
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,008
Stop here for a minute!

406
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,044
Sheela Madam is
still with the school.

407
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,804
Let's go and meet her.

408
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,606
She loves it when old
students come and meet her.

409
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,806
No.

410
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,564
It'll hardly take two minutes.

411
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,283
I really don't remember much.

412
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,364
I was not here long enough.

413
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,527
Honestly, I don't remember.

414
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,008
It's been years since
I left this place.

415
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,285
Just take us home

416
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,204
Where to?
- Rajbaug.

417
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,406
Name?

418
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,641
Faiyaz Dar.

419
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,161
Identity card?

420
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,486
Let him go.

421
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,411
Dog!

422
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:32,647
They think they can rule
us by instilling fear.

423
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,127
200 terrorists and 7,00,000
security men deployed!

424
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,442
There has to be some reason.

425
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,488
I don't follow Kashlniri
language so well any more.

426
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,724
Speak in Hindi or English

427
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:58,685
My child. You haven't
changed one bit.

428
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,126
Come in.

429
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,362
Everyone has been
waiting to meet you

430
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,761
Farida this is Megha

431
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,764
Mother, speak to her in Hindi.

432
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,531
She has forgotten Kashmiri.

433
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,931
What rubbish

434
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,241
Can anyone ever forget
their mother tongue?

435
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,771
How is your mother?

436
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,365
Why did you not get her along?

437
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,163
She suffered a paralytic stroke.

438
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,050
She cannot move around much.

439
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,561
Yah Allah!

440
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,801
You did not inform us...

441
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,409
...you didn't even
tell us over the phone.

442
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,163
We thought all was well.

443
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,169
Everything is fine.

444
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,010
There is no problem.

445
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,845
In the beginning...

446
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,161
...we hoped to return here...

447
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,243
...but now we are settled in Delhi.

448
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,004
Did you buy a house in Delhi?

449
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,650
We had no other option.

450
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,442
How long could we
live with relatives?

451
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,131
You are right.

452
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,521
There is nothing like
being in your own home.

453
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,207
Initially dad was reluctant.

454
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,049
"Delhi, is this
any place to live!"

455
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,521
Mr. Matteo never quite liked Delhi.

456
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,326
He would always return in
a week, making up excuses.

457
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,403
He never could stay put in Delhi.

458
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,921
But when they killed Vikas Uncle...

459
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,884
...my father gave in.

460
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,208
He lost all desire to return.

461
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,845
With no job in sight...

462
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,924
...he sat at home all day, worrying.

463
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,044
He had a massive heart attack

464
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,489
What destructive times

465
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,484
Eat something my child

466
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,530
you have not touched anything

467
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,965
No, thank you.

468
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,765
I had breakfast...

469
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,205
...on the flight.

470
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,042
Where do I need to sign?

471
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,925
What's the hurry?

472
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,081
Stay back a few days...

473
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,002
No, thank you.

474
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,889
I am taking tomorrow's flight back.

475
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,567
Day after tomorrow, I am
leaving for Singapore on work.

476
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,244
But my child...

477
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,845
The documents are ready.

478
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,048
I have called the lawyer.

479
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,248
He should he here by 4 pm.

480
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,890
Megha, why don't you go in and rest.

481
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,961
Ruhina, take her to her own room.

482
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,441
If you need...(Kashlniri)

483
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:41,322
If you need anything, I am around.

484
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,605
Hey!

485
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,729
Ya I am calling from Srinagar.

486
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:46,406
Paradise!

487
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,691
Hey listen, send that HR
report tomorrow. Hard Copy

488
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,286
I will return tomorrow.

489
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,522
But the report needs
to he sent today, okay?

490
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,369
What? Don't you get it in Delhi?

491
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,761
Where do I go looking
for saffron here?

492
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,642
Okay I shall try.

493
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,770
Okay, thanks.

494
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,689
<i>(MOM) leave everything.
You can go. I will stay right here!</i>

495
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,764
<i>(DAD) Haven't you read the papers?</i>

496
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,604
<i>We will be killed if
we live here any longer.</i>

497
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,808
<i>It will take a while
fur things tn be normal.</i>

498
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,445
<i>Let's move to Delhi for a while.</i>

499
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,968
<i>If we stay on, anything may happen.</i>

500
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,283
<i>We will go for just
six-seven months.</i>

501
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,761
<i>(MOM) Mark my wards. Once we leave</i>

502
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:00,287
<i>no one will let us come back.</i>

503
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,251
How come you are here?

504
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,328
<i>Megha you stay.</i>

505
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,845
<i>Let the others leave.</i>

506
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,364
<i>If everyone leaves,</i>

507
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,249
<i>I too will have to.</i>

508
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,970
<i>I have an idea.</i>

509
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,049
<i>Get married to Faraoq.</i>

510
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,122
<i>Then you don't have to go anywhere.</i>

511
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,124
<i>Are you crazy?</i>

512
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,850
<i>We are Hindu Pandits.</i>

513
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,730
<i>And Farooq is younger to me.</i>

514
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,521
<i>So? You will quietly leave too?</i>

515
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,808
<i>Why don't you come along...</i>

516
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,761
<i>Dad said he would enroll me at
St. Stephens College In Delhi.</i>

517
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,402
<i>Come along, it will be fun.</i>

518
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,962
<i>Na, 1 can 't.</i>

519
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,283
<i>I can't leave home and go to India.</i>

520
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,531
<i>Then stay here,</i>

521
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,602
<i>in a burkha!</i>

522
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,885
<i>Shut up</i>

523
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,801
Do you like covering your head?

524
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,211
I have got used to it

525
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,844
What happened to your Az...?

526
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,126
Azaan?

527
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,531
He left for America

528
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,888
Why didn't you get married?

529
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,805
You didn't either!

530
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,841
What about Farooq?

531
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,485
Brother is fine.

532
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,241
What does he do these days?

533
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,448
I didn't see him. ls he away?

534
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,802
No, he's home.

535
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,683
Vikas uncle's house!

536
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,283
Look at the state of it!

537
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,849
Megha, let's go hack.

538
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,484
Mother must be waiting.

539
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,686
You go ahead, I will come in a hit.

540
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:21,044
Let's cross the borders
And get Kalashnikovs

541
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,722
Let's cross the borders
And get Kalashnikovs

542
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:30,120
The soulless and the
faithless Leave our land!

543
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,251
The soulless and the
faithless Leave our land!

544
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:40,204
We want freedom! We want freedom!

545
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:46,803
We want freedom! We want freedom!

546
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:53,362
We want freedom! We want freedom!

547
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:00,447
Allah Ho Akbar!

548
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:41,565
We want Pakistan!

549
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,721
Megha!

550
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:22,846
Don't worry, I am not going to cry.

551
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:37,966
Farooq, do you recognize
her? This is Megha.

552
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,441
Adaab.

553
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,011
Salam walekum.

554
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,130
Mr. Nazir, can we speak
to you for a moment?

555
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,169
What is it?

556
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,166
Farooq Ahmad, do you
recognize this man?

557
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,925
No.

558
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,684
"14 MILITANTS SURRENDER."

559
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,126
Are you sure?

560
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,929
We have nothing to do with this man.

561
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,887
It's been six years
since Farooq surrendered.

562
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,088
But every other day they
are hack to question him.

563
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,364
Our lives have become hell.

564
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,130
It would have been
better off a martyr.

565
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,326
I- IQ II lfi

566
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,442
Why have we displayed this
photograph like an award?

567
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,800
So that every visitor
knows we are reformed.

568
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:19,282
Show them pictures and articles
to prove that we are reformed.

569
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,048
Rubi let her eat in peace.

570
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,210
It's been six years!

571
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:36,086
He is still considered a terrorist!

572
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,005
Never mind, have your lunch.

573
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,209
Do you remember this place?

574
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,561
It has changed

575
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,567
There used to he a little shop here

576
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:00,327
where Rubina and I
used to buy hooks.

577
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,762
Why is it so deserted?

578
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,490
It's an Army area.

579
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,804
Salam walequm Mr. Beig!

580
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,844
Walequm Assalam!

581
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,128
Do you recognize her?

582
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,965
She is Mr.Matoo's daughter

583
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,887
You have really grown!

584
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,971
Child, how is Mr. Matoo?

585
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,371
Is Your Mom doing fine?

586
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:35,726
Your father hasn't come?

587
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,165
Your mother hasn't come?

588
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:39,921
Give us some saffron.

589
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,161
Sure.

590
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,930
She wanted to take some home.

591
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,328
What are you doing dear?

592
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,164
How can I accept money from you?

593
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,123
I took your mother to the
hospital for your delivery.

594
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,001
Your uncle Vikas used
to visit us everyday

595
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,411
to meet my son Shahnawaaz...

596
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,124
Will this ever end!

597
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:19,722
You took me to
Shahnawaaz's father's store?

598
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,928
Forget what happened in the past.

599
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,167
Vikas Uncle was killed by Shahnawaaz

600
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,044
in his own house!

601
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,770
They were supposed to he friends!

602
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,763
Shahnawaaz was also killed,

603
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,209
While crossing the border,

604
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,370
in an encounter with the Army.

605
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,721
Good

606
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,605
Don't say that my child

607
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,121
Everyone here has paid a price.

608
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,488
Shahnawaaz was a good boy.

609
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:49,641
God knows what came
over him that night

610
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,048
that he killed his friend.

611
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,244
When is the lawyer coming!

612
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,290
A lot of the houses were empty.

613
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,601
The CRPF has occupied most of them.

614
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,967
These houses have not
been repaired for years.

615
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,963
.Thats why they are in ruins..

616
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,361
Legally, it's not an easy
process to buy these properties.

617
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,841
Now people have started
returning. Let's see what happens

618
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:16,922
How many families have returned?

619
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,564
Here comes Megha

620
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:21,566
May I talk to her

621
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:22,766
Sure.

622
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,080
Thanks.

623
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,089
Hi my name is Abhimanyu.

624
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,446
I am from Bengaluru.

625
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,249
I am here to make a documentary.

626
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:35,085
I am researching for it.

627
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:38,409
I have spoken to some people
to understand the situation.

628
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,884
Lawyer Zaffar Khan told
me why you have come.

629
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:45,924
I was wondering if
I could talk to you,

630
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,525
get your point of view.

631
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,250
This is your house, right?

632
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:51,806
No.

633
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,446
But...

634
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,522
No, I do not wish to talk to you.

635
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:56,926
No interview!

636
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,331
See, don't get me wrong,

637
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,324
I don't want to make
a one-sided film.

638
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,284
You are a Kashmiri Pandit.

639
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,088
It's important to know your story.

640
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:07,085
You too have suffered.

641
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:10,484
No, I have not suffered.

642
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,569
I have a great life
and I am actually glad

643
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,486
that I am out of here
and in the real world.

644
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,882
Child, this is still your house,

645
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:56,205
come whenever you wish to.

646
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,009
Man may reach the moon,

647
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,570
but he cannot forget his home.

648
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:02,651
Singapore, America, wherever you go,

649
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,843
this is your home.

650
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,251
Keep coming.

651
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,651
Keep the memories alive.

652
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,928
Salam walequm sister, all well?

653
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,810
Fine. This is my cousin.

654
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,041
Are you a tourist?

655
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,250
Your first time in Kashmir?

656
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,844
Do you know whom these
houses belonged to?

657
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,049
The Pundits who ran away.

658
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,321
Fled? Or forced to leave?

659
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,606
Meaning?

660
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:41,410
If somebody threatens
you, intimidates you,

661
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:42,686
and order you to leave,

662
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:46,162
and you leave, what would it mean?

663
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,366
Fled? Or forced to leave?

664
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,566
Megha!

665
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:51,006
Forced to leave.

666
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,204
Right.
- Megha, let's go.

667
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,322
Is there anything else besides
these barbed wires in Srinagar?

668
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:02,086
Imagine if peace reigned here,

669
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:05,250
the barbed-wire
business would go broke.

670
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,290
Business of war!

671
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:20,281
Look! Let's go that way

672
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,005
Father!

673
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:36,409
I know he wished to he hack here!

674
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,165
Goodbye mom.

675
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:19,526
Visit us again my child
and bring your mother along.

676
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:23,011
Dad I'll take your leave.

677
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:36,604
Do you think the swallows
will arrive by the 15th?

678
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:38,526
N ever.

679
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:43,168
Let's he! on it. 100 rupees.

680
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,123
They will be here by
the 15th, for sure!

681
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,486
Ruhina, why don't you get
Farookh involved in theatre?

682
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,124
It can be very good therapy.

683
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,011
He used to love acting, right?

684
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,288
Megha, you have become
a Delhi city girl.

685
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:11,168
Do you know there is only
one cinema hall left here.

686
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:14,771
By evening, everyone
is hack home in fear.

687
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:18,323
They watch TV. That's our life.

688
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,168
Why didn't you marry Azaan?

689
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:25,124
You would have been
in America by now.

690
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:27,767
I was not born with
your kind of luck.

691
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,245
What luck Rubina?

692
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:38,163
Fleeing like thieves in the dead
of the night to save our lives?

693
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,409
Living in refugee camps?

694
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:49,681
Not return home for
20 years? What luck?

695
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,211
Megha I am sorry.

696
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:55,242
I understand what you went through.

697
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:57,401
But we too...

698
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:58,891
Please cut it out Rubina!

699
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:01,840
What do you have a problem with?

700
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,442
Is the Army treating you badly?

701
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,529
Is India taking away your rights?

702
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:07,921
Or is it that you are
not allowed to forget"

703
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,128
"that your brother
was a trained Mujahideen?

704
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:13,449
What is your problem?

705
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,642
The punishment of
living in this paradise!

706
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:27,608
It's beyond my imagination to
think if all this hadn't happened,

707
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:29,451
where I could have been?

708
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:31,445
What would he my life like?

709
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,889
You are upset with us.

710
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,688
But just for a moment think,

711
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:44,361
what if I had left

712
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:49,164
and you got left behind?

713
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:55,926
Shadows of days gone by

714
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,050
Deep shadows that return to haunt

715
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,451
I'm fine, Megha!

716
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,050
You should leave now.

717
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:05,925
You have a flight to catch.

718
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,450
It was nice meeting you.

719
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,491
Take care

720
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:15,443
Like autumn leaves

721
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:16,601
Let's go.

722
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:20,082
My happiness scatters

723
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:28,160
My cold breath exhales helplessness

724
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:32,843
The colourful dawn

725
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:36,928
The fragrant breeze

726
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:45,121
Gifts of life

727
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:53,240
Snatched away untimely

728
00:54:53,640 --> 00:55:01,640
We didn't have a moment
to understand the loss

729
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,603
I often dream that

730
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:18,920
I am at our coffee plantation,

731
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,126
with my mother.

732
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:23,768
I am learning to ride
an old bicycle.

733
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,403
I am holding on to it tightly,

734
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:29,804
Repeatedly saving
myself from falling down.

735
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:39,727
It's strange but in that dream,

736
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,529
I am always a girl.

737
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:45,851
Even I have been
thinking for a while Abhimanyu,

738
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,046
You aren't gay are you?

739
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:51,566
What do you think?

740
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,564
Well if you are,
then what a waste!

741
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,086
Tell me.

742
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,484
Hey you nameless cat,

743
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,648
you are exactly like your master.

744
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:11,960
A traitor!

745
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:15,200
If a girl like you is single,

746
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,762
then she is being independent,

747
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:20,321
but I am gay?

748
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:21,721
An attractive man,

749
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:24,963
who is constantly
surrounded by beautiful women,

750
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:27,202
and yet he does not
think with his dick!

751
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,807
Do you find me attractive?

752
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:42,011
You will not he able to charm me.

753
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,210
I am not like those other women

754
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:46,886
or men you have.

755
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:54,886
Jealous?

756
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:57,566
Don't change the topic.

757
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:01,160
Are you sleeping
with any of them... huh?

758
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:08,043
Your problem is that
I don't think with my dick.

759
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:11,800
But if a man did that,

760
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,405
you'd just call him an asshole.

761
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:16,241
Caught me!

762
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:20,841
Listen,

763
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:23,280
So when are you
going to introduce me

764
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:24,725
to that architect friend of yours?

765
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:28,726
Aparna... right?

766
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:42,769
Hey Ashu, come take the hall...
Come!

767
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:53,806
Foul!

768
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:55,766
Goal!

769
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,049
You won with a foul goal.

770
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:01,323
No, that wasn't a foul.

771
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:03,402
You deliberately fell down Uncle.

772
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,289
No I did not fall down deliberately,

773
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:06,886
That was a foul goal son.

774
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,766
Also I want to tell you something

775
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:10,965
stop calling me uncle.

776
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:13,441
You don't have a father, right?

777
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:15,281
That means I am your father.

778
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:18,443
And if you address me as Dad,

779
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:20,249
then even mom will he pleased,
right?

780
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:26,446
Ashu are you asleep?

781
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,121
You are awake!

782
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,281
Look what I got for you,

783
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,321
Game King!

784
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,321
Come one, let's go to my room.

785
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:34,526
I shall teach you the game,

786
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:35,681
before mom comes back tomorrow.

787
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:37,361
Come on, my son.

788
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,965
<i>Hey hi. Hi</i>

789
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:53,441
Hi Ahhi

790
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:54,646
When did you come back from Mumbai?

791
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:55,961
Couple of days.

792
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:57,121
Cool.

793
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,006
Looks quite sexy, huh!

794
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:01,210
Come, come, join me. Coffee?

795
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:02,601
Thanks.

796
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,004
Don't look
so harried seeing me here.

797
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:07,726
Are you here to visit your family?

798
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:12,489
Yeah. Mom was unwell
and a few other things.

799
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:13,641
Right.

800
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:17,245
How is the film shaping up?

801
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:19,926
Fine. Keeps me busy.

802
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:24,809
Natasha told me about the incident.

803
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,808
It was shocking. Horrible.

804
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:29,966
Tell me what happened.

805
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:33,531
Abhi, since that evening you

806
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:36,080
haven't called me even once.

807
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:39,769
<i>Oh hi, 1 wished tn but...</i>

808
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:40,921
Excuse me,

809
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,126
would you like to place your order?

810
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:42,530
Yeah

811
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:43,328
Yes, I will have...

812
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:44,162
One black coffee.

813
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,041
Right sir.

814
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:47,723
That's it.

815
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:48,881
Thank you.

816
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:54,366
Jai I really wanted to call you,

817
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:57,842
but I got busy with my film.

818
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:01,284
So how is filming?

819
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,000
It's almost done.

820
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:07,244
Hey I got to go.

821
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:08,881
Enjoy your coffee.

822
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:12,164
Next time something like
this happens,

823
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:13,321
call me.

824
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,561
I will hash up the bastards.

825
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:19,445
Next time you need
company for a drink,

826
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,206
call me.

827
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:24,321
That will he nice.

828
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:27,128
In fact, bring Vishal along.

829
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:29,289
I was thinking of asking him

830
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:31,567
to score music for my film.

831
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:34,088
Actually, Vishal and l...

832
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,003
we broke up.

833
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:39,363
Oh, am sorry.

834
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:41,011
But if you wish to, I could...

835
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:42,366
No Jai, it would be
awkward for you.

836
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:42,884
Forget it.

837
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:44,724
No, I could call him.

838
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:46,643
Sure? You are okay with that?

839
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:48,805
Thanks Jai, I will call you.

840
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:50,286
Bye Ahhi

841
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:51,441
Bye Jai

842
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:54,841
Asshole

843
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:05,761
I love this number.

844
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:08,327
Aparna, Aparna Let's go dance.

845
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,164
No, let me enjoy my drink.

846
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:12,561
Abhi lets go dance

847
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:13,801
I don't like to dance

848
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:15,484
This is against our culture

849
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:17,801
This is Bengaluru,
anyone could heat us up.

850
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:21,286
I am going to dance

851
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:28,883
I read about your
restoration work in Gangtok.

852
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:31,246
What about Bengaluru?

853
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:34,886
There are lots of buildings here
as well that need restoration.

854
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:38,484
In fact, builders are eagerly
waiting for them to collapse.

855
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:41,321
You seem rather
interested in antique things.

856
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:46,161
Some things are worth preserving.

857
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,482
Like wildlife, architecture,

858
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:49,527
environment

859
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:51,807
and children!

860
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:55,481
If you don't mind my saying it,

861
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:59,887
But very few men think
the way you do.

862
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:06,361
I am special

863
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:18,050
It's pretty noisy in here.

864
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:38,529
Ashish, why haven't you had lunch?

865
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:40,641
Your mother will he upset

866
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,768
and will say I don't feed you.

867
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:44,046
Come on, let's go down
and have lunch.

868
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:47,929
Ashish, come and eat.

869
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:49,846
Ashish I am talking to you...

870
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:52,121
Come on.

871
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,210
Cat, where were you?

872
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:02,366
Get rid of this. Move it.

873
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:06,722
Ashu when I am talking to you,

874
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:09,565
I expect a response. Get up.

875
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:11,369
I will tell mom.

876
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:15,645
You won't do any such thing.

877
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:20,808
You realize how much
she loves me, right?

878
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,370
She won't believe you.

879
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:29,331
Ashu, if you are a good boy,

880
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:30,845
even mom will be happy.

881
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:32,441
Or do you want her to go away,

882
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:33,681
where your father is?

883
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:35,566
No, right?

884
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:38,368
Even I don't like raising
my hand on you.

885
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:41,971
Don't make me angry all the time.
Okay?

886
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:43,611
My dear son

887
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:45,723
you know how much I love you?

888
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:09,041
Look at the tadpoles there...

889
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:20,801
Mom!

890
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:37,566
Mom!

891
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:15,371
Laiden with weight

892
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:19,400
Are the moments...
in the evenings...

893
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:22,446
Blank

894
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:26,566
ls the gaze

895
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:29,441
Laiden with weight

896
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:33,570
Are the moments...
in the evenings...

897
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:36,651
Blank

898
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:40,122
ls the gaze

899
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:44,443
...has disappeared...

900
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:47,807
The light

901
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:54,525
That was... once in these eyes...

902
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:57,926
Laiden with weight

903
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,846
Are the moments...
in the evenings...

904
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:04,920
Blank

905
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:08,682
ls the gaze

906
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:26,291
These birds...

907
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:28,169
Of dejection...

908
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:30,244
On my rooftop...

909
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:37,125
Come everyday ... come everyday...

910
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:40,371
This ocean...

911
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:42,841
Of sadness...

912
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:46,970
Drenches my heart...

913
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:51,207
Drenches my heart...

914
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:55,767
Shattered are

915
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:58,920
The dreams that inhabited

916
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:05,121
In these eyes

917
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:08,731
Laiden with weight

918
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:12,567
Are the moments...
in the evenings...

919
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:15,886
Blank

920
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:19,885
ls the gaze

921
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:30,489
Cat! Cat!

922
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,126
You follow anybody...

923
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:35,321
Oh... you!

924
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:38,886
I told you...

925
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:40,724
you are exactly like her!

926
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:42,326
Looking at the two of you

927
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,209
I am reminded of Breakfast
at Tiffany's,

928
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:47,441
and she is Audrey Hepburn.

929
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:49,125
You are still angry!

930
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:51,126
Aparna wanted to go home,

931
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:52,531
and I dropped her. That's it.

932
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:54,887
And you didn't think it
necessary to inform me?

933
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:56,724
Sweetheart,
you were enjoying yourself,

934
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:58,724
So, I though why ruin your evening.

935
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:02,886
Come on sweetheart,

936
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:04,450
why do you get upset
over small things?

937
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:06,284
And it's a mere coincidence that

938
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:10,201
Aparna's next project is the
restoration of a villa at Jayanagar,

939
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:12,010
and you are buying an apartment

940
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:13,764
in an art decor building!

941
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:15,281
Now you are over reacting...

942
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:19,885
I'll take you out for
dinner tomorrow night.

943
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:25,085
I don't understand why
I keep forgiving you.

944
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:26,321
Because you know that

945
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:27,970
I'm the one who loves you the most.

946
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:29,366
Hall!!!

947
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:33,085
I'm getting late for my shoot.

948
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:35,081
Then leave!

949
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:40,050
Moon

950
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:41,248
Bye.

951
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:43,322
River...

952
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:45,810
Come... Let's start.

953
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:47,726
Ship...

954
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:49,646
No.

955
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:52,606
Okay, then house

956
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:53,961
Not this kind of house,

957
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:56,722
but in some multi-storeyed building

958
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:58,481
in Bengaluru-.

959
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:00,770
Tall buildings.

960
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:04,686
Do you know, when we grow up,

961
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:06,125
Then far away from Mangalore,

962
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:07,326
we will live in a house like that.

963
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:08,401
Ashu!

964
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:12,763
Papa I want a bicycle with a gear.

965
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:15,002
But son you already
have this cycle!

966
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:16,924
You don't know anything mom!

967
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:18,726
Papa please!

968
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:21,644
I had shown you the picture
of a rally bicycle with gears.

969
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:24,491
Why do you want a new bicycle
every now and then?

970
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:26,961
Asha, leave it,
it's just a cycle.

971
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:28,761
You are spoiling him Vinay!

972
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,607
Okay listen son, you
will get your bicycle.

973
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:36,167
But you'll have to
forfeit your birthday gift.

974
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:37,002
Done!

975
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:39,410
Ok! Now promise your mother

976
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:41,562
that this will be your last cycle.

977
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:43,730
After this one,
I will buy you a motorbike!

978
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:48,840
Asha understand that
our son is growing up!

979
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:50,922
Asha! Asha!

980
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:54,807
Hey handsome!

981
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:56,564
Hey gorgeous, looking good!

982
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:02,526
Tell me,

983
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:04,929
why does a sexy woman like you

984
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:06,481
not have a boyfriend?

985
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:07,766
What do you mean?

986
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:10,367
I was just wondering...

987
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:11,646
Be original honey.

988
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:14,683
I am hungry.

989
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:15,602
Shall we leave for dinner?

990
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:16,841
Jai and Vishal are
also coming along.

991
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:18,361
Jai and Vishal?

992
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:21,208
Jai wanted to go out for dinner...

993
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:23,568
You want Vishal to compose
the music for your film?

994
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:30,330
How much will you use everybody?

995
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:33,364
Spare some people at least!

996
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:39,686
I am leaving.

997
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:42,206
Babes, what's your problem?

998
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:43,563
What's the big deal.

999
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:44,607
[just can't understand.

1000
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:45,727
That is the problem.

1001
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:48,360
Motherfucker!

1002
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:52,961
Ashu

1003
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:54,406
Come in

1004
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:57,089
I'll be back tomorrow, okay.

1005
01:10:58,600 --> 01:10:59,681
Bye Ma.

1006
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:02,448
Give my regards to grandmother
and grandfather.

1007
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:06,084
And you take care of dad.

1008
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:09,487
He hasn't been keeping well.

1009
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:12,606
Okay?

1010
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:40,122
This is my ticket to freedom,

1011
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:44,128
and you will pay for it.

1012
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:28,042
Yes Ma

1013
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:30,168
Go to the hospital and
meet him at least once.

1014
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:38,088
Ma, I am busy with my edit.

1015
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:40,250
Ashu what's wrong with you?

1016
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:42,371
Ever since you moved to Bengaluru,

1017
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:44,568
you keep finding
excuses to avoid meeting us.

1018
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:46,686
He is your father.

1019
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:49,051
He is dying.

1020
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:51,085
He wants to meet you one last time.

1021
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:53,006
He cared for you.

1022
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:56,131
Yet all this makes
no difference to you.

1023
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:19,246
The door's open

1024
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:27,686
What Happened?

1025
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:35,730
Did you have a fight with Aparna?

1026
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:38,808
Or did she finally realize...

1027
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:45,801
Abhi!

1028
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:56,245
Ma called.

1029
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:00,410
My stepfather is seriously ill.

1030
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:04,530
He doesn't have much time left...

1031
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:10,283
Sorry, but you weren't close,
were you?

1032
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:14,446
Close!!!

1033
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:17,204
When I moved to Bengaluru,

1034
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:20,769
I thought I'd leave my past behind.

1035
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:24,971
I even changed my name...

1036
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:34,090
And you told your mom nothing
in the last ten years?

1037
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:39,726
Twice every month,

1038
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:44,489
Mom used to visit her family
in Coorg coffee plantation.

1039
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:50,124
I couldn't go because
I had school to attend.

1040
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:56,525
I stayed hack at home, with him.

1041
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:00,406
And each time...

1042
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:09,368
It sounds weird,

1043
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,041
but after a while

1044
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:25,840
I was comforted by his
love or whatever you call it.

1045
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:31,608
I began to take advantage of him.

1046
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:37,489
If I needed anything l...

1047
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:44,241
At the age of thirteen,

1048
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:48,004
I was like a... like a slut.

1049
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:52,130
You were a child Abhi.

1050
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:10,605
He wishes to meet me.

1051
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:18,281
Should I fulfill
a dying man's last wish?

1052
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:22,566
He should have died
a long time ago

1053
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:28,885
I keep hearing mom's voice.

1054
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:36,565
I don't know what to do...

1055
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:40,971
I- lfi II

1056
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:49,766
Will you come with me?

1057
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:57,769
He died last night at 2.00 am.

1058
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:04,560
We didn't bring him home.

1059
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:12,922
We cremated him this morning

1060
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:19,130
His nephew lit the funeral pyre.

1061
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:26,561
Sorry Ma.

1062
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:30,811
You should have done it.

1063
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:34,765
Abhi is here now Aunty,

1064
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:37,491
and that's more than enough.

1065
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:44,606
I'll be back

1066
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:58,561
Were you asleep?

1067
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:02,121
Come Ma.

1068
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:09,326
She is nice.

1069
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:11,561
Natasha.

1070
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:16,683
Yes, she is nice.

1071
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:20,369
I think she does not like me

1072
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:39,004
Ma, she knows.

1073
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:43,283
What? What does she know?

1074
01:18:55,320 --> 01:19:00,247
That he was looking to marry
a woman with a small child.

1075
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:05,970
What are you saying Ashu!

1076
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:10,086
He loved you so much...

1077
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:11,810
Every time you were away,

1078
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:16,844
he came to me in the nights.

1079
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:21,371
Li es

1080
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:24,410
You are lying

1081
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,287
For ten years,
didn't you see anything Ma?

1082
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:35,282
Or did you not want to see?

1083
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:39,411
Is this why you came?

1084
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:42,491
I'm your mother.

1085
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:56,850
And I am your son, Ma.

1086
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:03,090
He is no more, and
you are accusing him...

1087
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:06,690
You have become very selfish.

1088
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:17,085
Perhaps you are right

1089
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:23,888
When you wish to face the truth,

1090
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:26,406
call me...

1091
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:56,003
Cat we are home

1092
01:20:57,680 --> 01:21:00,923
Abhi, why doesn't
this cat have a name?

1093
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:04,609
I found my first cat
on the streets.

1094
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:08,320
I started calling him cat,

1095
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:09,890
and it stayed.

1096
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:12,720
And one day in a fit of anger,

1097
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:14,404
he killed the cat.

1098
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:18,481
The next day

1099
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,206
he got me a new cat.

1100
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:24,368
The new cat took
over from the old one,

1101
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:27,730
but didn't last too long.

1102
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:30,086
Then came the third cat

1103
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:36,201
and this is cat number four.

1104
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,650
The third cat got run over by a car.

1105
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:43,960
We shall take good care of this cat.

1106
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:47,206
Come.

1107
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:17,131
<i>(radio) body of a civilian.
Mohammad Maqbul Gani,</i>

1108
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:21,450
<i>resident of Saribala in Srinagar;
was found near Maisuma Band.</i>

1109
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,606
<i>All trade activities

1115
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:49,206
Mohan, shut off the radio.

1116
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:52,641
Hey Nats, I am hack.

1117
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:56,246

1118
01:22:58,120 --> 01:23:01,363
I flew back two-three days ago.

01:23:05,960 --> 01:23:08,247
I had to be away.

1121
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:11,684
Okay listen,

1122
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:13,649

to come to Bengaluru.

1123
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:16,725
Of course
I heard the news darling,

1124
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:18,689
I don't live in the boonies.

1125
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:20,446
Yeah.

1126
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:22,929
M last am allowed
to breathe freely.

1127
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:25,602
Hail the Delhi High Court!

1128
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:29,486
I don't know, I'm not so...

1129
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:40,801
Nats I'll call you back in a bit.

1130
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:44,248
Mohan, stop!

1131
01:23:57,640 --> 01:23:58,846
Wait.

1132
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:35,241
Hi Nats!

1133
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:36,801
What's up dear?

1134
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:38,446
How was the shoot?

1135
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:42,323
Okay listen,
I am off to Sydney in April.

1136
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:43,970
Not just in New Town, okay.

1137
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:45,691
I am going for a conference.

1138
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:48,404
Conference is for three days.

1139
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:51,451
If you want some make-up
stuff just give me a call okay?

1140
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:52,646
Bye dear.

1141
01:25:01,160 --> 01:25:03,970
Excuse me, may I look at that?

1142
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:09,046

the show timings.

1144
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:22,691
I believe Milk is a good movie.

1145
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:26,926
I was considering watching it.

1146
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:30,124
So were you waiting for me?

1147
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:44,326
Hi, I am Omar from Delhi.

1148
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,161

1149
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:51,161
I am Jai

1150
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:52,765

1151
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:55,886
Sorry.

1152
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:58,201
Yes Mom,

I am at work.

1154
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:01,481
Dinner?

1155
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:07,201
Not so sure about dinner.

1156
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:13,685
Sydney is in April, Mom.

1157
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:17,330
You and dad should have dinner.

1158
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:19,688
Okay Mom, bye-

1159
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:22,321
Sorry Omar.

1160
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:23,606
What a beautiful name.

1161
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:25,246
Omar Sharif,

1162
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:26,560
what a beautiful man.

1163
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:32,568
Actually your girlfriend
can sing for you -

1164
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:36,409
(punning on his name.)
He killed me, he killed me...

1165
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:38,006
Terrible one!

1166
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,321
Unfortunately,
I don't have a girlfriend.

1167
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:45,446
It's already 9.30.

1168
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:47,011
The movie would have started.

1169
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:49,120
Well...

1170
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:53,600
I am off for dinner.

1171
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:57,166
It was nice meeting you.

1172
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,241
Come on, let's go for dinner.

1173
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:06,401
It's my treat.

1174
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:07,641
What about your coffee?

1175
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,286
Ha ha ha

1176
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:18,086
So how does a struggling actor

1177
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:21,570
survive in, big bad Bombay?

1178
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:24,401
Rich parents?

1179
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:30,004
They are against
my becoming an actor.

1180
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:33,530
I ran away from
my hotel management course.

1181
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:37,407
And they are waiting
for me to return home.

1182
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:40,401
Thousands come here.

1183
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:42,610
Why do you think you
will he successful?

1184
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:46,005
It's been my childhood dream.

1185
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:49,607
I an! willing to do anything
to prove my talent.

1186
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:51,725
Anything?

1187
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:54,849
I have a friend, Abhimanyu.

1188
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:56,001
He's a director.

1189
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:57,440
I shall text him.

1190
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:01,640
Actually no, no.

1191
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:04,440
Omar from Delhi,

1192
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:06,807
you find yourself
a rich girlfriend.

1193
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:11,929
What if I am not looking
for one then?

1194
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:17,203
What if am looking
for someone like you?

1195
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:19,120
Yeah, I shall remember.

1196
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:27,929
Anyway, rich girls aren't
after someone like me.

1197
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:30,483
They want men like you.

1198
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:32,121
Rich,

1199
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:33,326

1200
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:34,526
handsome...

1201
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:36,811
Are you flattering me!

1202
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:38,841
No.

1203
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:40,331
I want someone,

1204
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:42,448
who likes ME.

1205
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:44,406
And who are you?

1206
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:46,566
Dessert?

1207
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,081
No thanks.

1208
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,331
Flat stomach.

1209
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:55,763
A flat stomach has its advantages.

1210
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:59,848
Only if you know how
to take advantage of it.

1211
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,161
What do you think Jai,

1212
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:05,041
I don't?

1213
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:11,846
It's 1.30 am.

1214
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:14,370
Thank you for a lovely meal.

1215
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:17,681
Drive?

1216
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:20,801
No. I should go home now.

1217
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:23,686
Are you sure

1218
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:28,206
No.

1219
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:33,371
Eyes

1220
01:29:34,640 --> 01:29:36,608
Speak something

1221
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:39,967
These eyes

1222
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:43,441
Speak something

1223
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:47,366
Trying to convey to you

1224
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:51,323
Unable to remain silent

1225
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:53,721
Plays hide and seek with gestures

1226
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:55,962
Today these eyes

1227
01:29:57,200 --> 01:29:59,362
Speak something

1228
01:30:01,160 --> 01:30:03,322
Trying to convey to you

1229
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:07,448
Unable to remain silent

1230
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:10,000
Plays hide and seek with gestures

1231
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:12,924
Today these eyes

1232
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:17,285
Speak something

1233
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:34,684
Many dreams are taking shape

1234
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:36,611
Making him nervous

1235
01:30:36,680 --> 01:30:38,011
Can't we go to your place?

1236
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:41,604
Why? It's so pleasant,

1237
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:43,411
It's a beautiful night

1238
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:48,562
Are you scared to take me home?

1239
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:52,202
No. My parents are visiting.

1240
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:54,371
Next time?

1241
01:30:55,480 --> 01:30:57,881
Speak something

1242
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:01,611
These eyes

1243
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:04,566
Speak something

1244
01:32:31,680 --> 01:32:32,408
What are you guys up to!

1245
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:33,163
Oh shit!

1246
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:34,890
Don't start. Are you crazy?

1247
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:35,722
What's wrong?

1248
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:36,483
No, don't.

1249
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:38,528
Come out. Out!

1250
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:51,241
Damn you!

1251
01:32:51,680 --> 01:32:52,567
Didn't you find any other place

1252
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:53,641
to get your ass fucked

1253
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:55,200
Fucking &%#

1254
01:32:55,560 --> 01:32:56,766
Sir you are mistaken,

1255
01:32:56,840 --> 01:32:58,729
we were just out for a ride.

1256
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:01,007
Sir, am actually
the managing director of...

1257
01:33:01,080 --> 01:33:02,605
Don't speak English!

1258
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:04,926
You came out for a ride?

1259
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:06,441
With your clothes off?

1260
01:33:06,720 --> 01:33:08,404
So the breeze hits
your body directly.

1261
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:14,406
Sir we were just...

1262
01:33:14,720 --> 01:33:15,721
Just like that, is it?

1263
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:16,961
Come on, let's go to
the police station...

1264
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:18,246
No sir, please sir, let us go...

So that you can f*** around?

1267
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:26,325
Ruining our culture!

1268
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:27,606
Aren't you ashamed?

1269
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:29,845
Can't you get it up with a girl?

1270
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:35,042
You, where did you trap him?

1271
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:37,169

No...

1274
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:44,961
It's the driver's licence.

1275
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:49,607
Jai Gowda!

1276
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:52,211
Or should it he Jai Gay?

1277
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:54,286
Are you from Madras?

1278
01:33:54,680 --> 01:33:56,967
No sir, from Bengaluru.

1279
01:33:59,640 --> 01:34:02,530
A#%&*

1280
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:04,647
And who is this?

1281
01:34:05,320 --> 01:34:06,207
Your whore?

1282
01:34:06,280 --> 01:34:09,045
No sir, he is my friend,

1283
01:34:09,240 --> 01:34:09,968

Don't try to fool me.

1287

1289
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:20,810
Since when have you known him?

1290
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:24,481
For a while sir.

1291
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:26,241
Please let him go.

1292
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:27,367
Let him go?

1293
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:28,441

you are already friends,

1296
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:33,527
And now even your
clothes have come off!

1297
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:35,649
Let's go to the police station.

1298
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:37,882
No sir, please sir,
we made a mistake...

1299
01:34:37,960 --> 01:34:39,041
Don't you dare touch me!

Please let me talk to him...

1304
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:50,084
Why aren't you speaking
in Hindi, Omar?

1305
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:51,082

Just trust me please.

1307
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:54,130
Now I can't do anything.

1308
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:56,769
If the higher authorities
get to know

1309
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:59,442
that I have let you go,

1310
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:02,326
my job will be on the line.

Just take it, please.

1319
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:24,602

You think I am an idiot!

1340
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:17,169
You are the managing director

01:36:17,240 --> 01:36:18,480
of a multinational company

1342
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:20,801

Come here.

1349
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:40,646
It'll become a big mess.

1350
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:41,960
How much money do you have?

1351
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:45,329

1356
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:55,848
Hey you two,

No sir.

1359
01:36:58,320 --> 01:36:59,651
Can't you get some money from home?

1360
01:36:59,960 --> 01:37:02,167
Home? I don't have so
much cash even there Omar!

1361
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:05,728

There is no cash at home.

01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:12,891
If you could go
with him to an ATM...

1365
01:37:13,640 --> 01:37:15,005
There is an ATM at Turner Road sir.

1366

Are you guys crazy?

You want to bribe me in public?

Do you want me in jail as well?

1370
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:24,483
No sir. I can go.

1371
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:26,689

Jai, it's okay.

1416
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:44,646
You go home.

1417
01:40:46,640 --> 01:40:47,448
No...

1418
01:40:48,640 --> 01:40:50,961
Shut up and leave quietly.

1419
01:40:51,160 --> 01:40:52,525
Haven't you had enough,

1420
01:40:52,600 --> 01:40:53,886
Do you want more?

1421
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:54,883
Come on!

1422
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:55,688
Move

1423
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:15,890
Jai... when did you get back?

1424
01:41:17,200 --> 01:41:19,282
Am glad they released you.

1425
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:22,167
You are looking fine.

1426
01:41:23,240 --> 01:41:24,162
Thanks.

1427
01:41:24,240 --> 01:41:26,686
You don't look like you
were in police custody.

1428
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:30,080
Does he look like he
was in police custody?

1429
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:32,086
Sorry, I have to meet someone.

1430
01:41:32,160 --> 01:41:33,366
Let's meet another time.

1431
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:38,248
Jai...

1432
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:39,481
How are you Omar?

1433
01:41:39,640 --> 01:41:42,120
It's been a while.

1434
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:44,840
Who will you rob now?

1435
01:41:46,240 --> 01:41:48,129
Now we aren't
criminals anymore, right?

1436
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:49,601
Who will you rob?

1437
01:41:49,680 --> 01:41:51,330
Jai, listen to me for...

1438
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:52,686
I don't want to hear anything.

1439
01:41:53,640 --> 01:41:54,846
Do you know why?

1440
01:41:55,960 --> 01:41:57,883
Because, that night
I did not go home.

1441
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:01,121
I met my company's biggest lawyer,

1442
01:42:01,200 --> 01:42:02,361
woke him up from bed ,

1443
01:42:02,440 --> 01:42:03,327
and took him to the police station

1444
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:04,287
to get you released.

1445
01:42:04,520 --> 01:42:09,367
But Omar wasn't there!

1446
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:11,000
Where the hell is Omar?

1447
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:13,561
That cop was there,

1448
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:17,131
he refused to even recognize me!

1449
01:42:17,200 --> 01:42:18,042
Jai...

1450
01:42:18,120 --> 01:42:19,326
And there were five other cops.

1451
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:22,282
They all started to laugh.

1452
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:27,251
That's when I realized,

1453
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:32,129
that's when I realized...

1454
01:42:33,120 --> 01:42:34,087
You hustler,

1455
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:35,846
you were hand-in-glove with them.

1456
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:37,401
You bastard!

1457
01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:41,244
Jai, I shall return your money.

1458
01:42:41,400 --> 01:42:43,402
Here's your phone.

1459
01:42:45,880 --> 01:42:46,881
I don't need it.

1460
01:42:47,160 --> 01:42:48,366
I don't want your money.

1461
01:42:57,800 --> 01:42:58,608
Don't touch me!

1462
01:42:58,680 --> 01:43:00,205
Don't. Don't touch me.

1463
01:43:06,320 --> 01:43:09,688
What I lost that day...

1464
01:43:14,960 --> 01:43:16,086
That day what l...

1465
01:43:33,960 --> 01:43:34,802
Let's go.
