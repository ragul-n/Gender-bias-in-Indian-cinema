1
00:03:06,533 --> 00:03:11,561
My heart.. my crazy heart.

2
00:03:13,006 --> 00:03:19,036
Do you know what love is?

3
00:03:21,915 --> 00:03:26,875
The destination of heartbeats.

4
00:03:28,455 --> 00:03:30,889
lt's a lonely call.

5
00:03:32,392 --> 00:03:34,656
A prayer to God.

6
00:03:35,795 --> 00:03:41,665
lt is a merciless obsession.

7
00:03:43,737 --> 00:03:49,073
lt doesn't give you any solace.

8
00:03:52,746 --> 00:03:57,513
My heart.. my crazy heart.

9
00:03:59,052 --> 00:04:03,386
Do you know what love is?

10
00:04:23,777 --> 00:04:28,714
Somebody appeared in my dreams.

11
00:04:29,616 --> 00:04:35,612
And gave the loneliness
of my youth a fragrance.

12
00:04:38,758 --> 00:04:50,761
Arousing cravings, making
my feelings fragrant

13
00:04:52,872 --> 00:04:58,139
l have complaints and regrets too.

14
00:05:00,413 --> 00:05:05,976
lf there is trust, there
is betrayal too.

15
00:05:08,121 --> 00:05:13,753
lt is a merciless obsession.

16
00:05:15,929 --> 00:05:21,162
lt doesn't give you any solace.

17
00:05:24,838 --> 00:05:29,775
My heart.. my crazy heart.

18
00:05:31,511 --> 00:05:37,711
Do you know what love is?

19
00:05:55,602 --> 00:06:00,539
The ambience was so lovely.

20
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:07,609
Without words, every
feeling was expressed.

21
00:06:09,716 --> 00:06:14,813
lf there is happiness,
there is sorrow too.

22
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:22,719
lf there is union, there
is bondage too.

23
00:06:24,998 --> 00:06:30,231
lt is a merciless obsession.

24
00:06:32,672 --> 00:06:38,167
lt doesn't give you any solace.

25
00:06:41,848 --> 00:06:46,547
My heart.. my crazy heart.

26
00:06:48,121 --> 00:06:54,253
Do you know what love is?

27
00:06:56,996 --> 00:07:01,899
The destination of heartbeats.

28
00:07:03,536 --> 00:07:06,004
lt's a lonely call.

29
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,731
A prayer to God.

30
00:07:12,145 --> 00:07:14,045
My heart..

31
00:07:30,897 --> 00:07:36,927
Good morning, Sophia.
- Good morning, Mrs. Gomes.

32
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:41,573
Oh no! .. l am late again!

33
00:07:44,577 --> 00:07:45,908
Why didn't this alarm ring?

34
00:07:46,646 --> 00:07:48,580
Where is Karan?
- At the office!

35
00:07:48,648 --> 00:07:49,910
Office? When did he leave?

36
00:07:49,983 --> 00:07:51,041
Sir left early in the morning.

37
00:07:53,086 --> 00:07:54,747
How can Karan wake up so early?

38
00:07:54,821 --> 00:07:55,913
With this alarm!

39
00:07:55,989 --> 00:07:57,581
lt can't wake you up.

40
00:07:57,657 --> 00:08:00,125
But it wakes up everybody
in the adjacent rooms.

41
00:08:33,326 --> 00:08:34,657
Hi, Rinkie! Hi, Rishita!

42
00:08:34,727 --> 00:08:35,955
You're late again!

43
00:08:37,363 --> 00:08:38,887
Do you know how angry
the manager is?

44
00:08:38,965 --> 00:08:40,159
Don't worry! l will handle it!

45
00:08:40,233 --> 00:08:41,825
Someday she will be fired!

46
00:08:41,901 --> 00:08:43,664
You are right! l don't know
what's wrong with her.

47
00:08:49,809 --> 00:08:50,867
Yes ma'am.

48
00:08:51,277 --> 00:08:52,642
One chicken burger, please.

49
00:08:52,812 --> 00:08:55,645
Sure, one chicken burger, right?

50
00:09:01,988 --> 00:09:04,388
Bye! Take care! See you!
- Bye! See you!

51
00:09:14,734 --> 00:09:16,827
You smell delicious!

52
00:09:20,006 --> 00:09:21,405
l feel like devouring you!

53
00:09:22,408 --> 00:09:25,002
lf l don't take a shower in
10 minutes, l will die!

54
00:09:25,078 --> 00:09:28,206
You mean we will have
to go home first?

55
00:09:28,815 --> 00:09:30,248
Do we have to go anywhere else?

56
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,924
Have a pleasant evening, sir!
- Thank you!

57
00:09:49,002 --> 00:09:50,094
You too madam. - Thank you.

58
00:09:58,378 --> 00:10:00,938
Maybe by making a toast, this
will taste different.

59
00:10:03,816 --> 00:10:04,874
Cheers!

60
00:10:12,725 --> 00:10:13,919
Karan, at times l find..

61
00:10:13,993 --> 00:10:16,052
..our relationship
as right out of a movie

62
00:10:16,796 --> 00:10:17,854
lt is something like..

63
00:10:18,364 --> 00:10:20,764
You are a rich guy.
And l am a poor girl.

64
00:10:21,234 --> 00:10:23,429
Do you think there is a happy
ending to this relationship?

65
00:10:24,337 --> 00:10:25,463
lt happens in movies.

66
00:10:26,739 --> 00:10:27,899
But this is real life.

67
00:10:29,008 --> 00:10:30,475
Life is stranger than fiction.

68
00:10:34,747 --> 00:10:35,805
Cheers!

69
00:10:52,265 --> 00:10:55,428
Excellent! You know, Sophia,

70
00:10:56,769 --> 00:10:58,828
Satyajit Ray was
a brilliant director!

71
00:11:00,073 --> 00:11:02,507
He took lndian cinema to
an international level!

72
00:11:04,844 --> 00:11:07,870
His movies depicted
fiction and reality.

73
00:11:08,448 --> 00:11:09,506
Just like real life.

74
00:11:13,453 --> 00:11:14,511
Are you sleeping?

75
00:11:19,192 --> 00:11:21,353
lf l don't reach Burger King
on time tomorrow morning,

76
00:11:21,427 --> 00:11:22,951
l will be sacked!

77
00:11:24,197 --> 00:11:26,859
That's real life! Good night!
- Good night!

78
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:40,541
l got my salary today.
This month's rent!

79
00:11:43,082 --> 00:11:46,540
Don't be silly. Can't we stop
this silly arrangement?

80
00:11:46,819 --> 00:11:48,116
A deal is a deal!

81
00:12:20,253 --> 00:12:21,982
Good morning.
- Good morning, darling.

82
00:12:22,255 --> 00:12:24,587
Where is Mrs. Gomes?
- lts her day off.

83
00:12:24,857 --> 00:12:27,587
So l thought of making 'Karan's
Special' for breakfast.

84
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,020
Omelette!

85
00:12:31,064 --> 00:12:32,122
You are a darling!

86
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:38,928
What are you looking at?

87
00:12:39,005 --> 00:12:40,597
l'm trying to see my future.

88
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,099
See anything?

89
00:12:44,343 --> 00:12:45,605
You are 60 years old.
l am 65 years old.

90
00:12:46,345 --> 00:12:48,870
We are at the dentist for dentures.

91
00:12:48,948 --> 00:12:50,006
Oh?

92
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,881
But l can't see whether you
have written your name as..

93
00:12:52,952 --> 00:12:54,886
..Mrs. Karan or something else.

94
00:12:55,588 --> 00:12:57,988
Let's resolve the problem..

95
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:05,629
Sophia, l want my grandson to
have lovely teeth like yours.

96
00:13:06,632 --> 00:13:09,294
l know we've only known
each other for 6 months,

97
00:13:09,368 --> 00:13:12,633
but l should have told you
this 5 months 29 days ago.

98
00:13:22,315 --> 00:13:23,373
Will you marry me?

99
00:13:26,252 --> 00:13:27,310
Yes, l will.

100
00:13:28,154 --> 00:13:30,952
l love you.
- l love you too.

101
00:14:12,632 --> 00:14:14,691
Change the CD.
- Okay.

102
00:14:16,669 --> 00:14:18,432
When will you learn
to change the CD?

103
00:14:29,615 --> 00:14:30,707
Hi!
- Do you have a reservation?

104
00:14:30,983 --> 00:14:32,382
ln Ronnie's name. - Okay.

105
00:14:38,491 --> 00:14:40,516
Do you know, l had come here for
celebration on valentines day?

106
00:14:40,593 --> 00:14:42,458
Really? - We had a lot of fun.

107
00:14:42,528 --> 00:14:45,463
You won't believe Rita was with me
and her boyfriend was there..

108
00:14:45,531 --> 00:14:47,590
We had so much fun.

109
00:14:47,667 --> 00:14:48,725
Come.

110
00:14:49,168 --> 00:14:50,226
Come.

111
00:14:51,003 --> 00:14:52,061
Come.

112
00:14:52,405 --> 00:14:54,396
You didn't bring your fiance?

113
00:14:54,473 --> 00:14:56,065
He would have financed this party.

114
00:14:56,142 --> 00:14:57,200
lt would have been so much fun.

115
00:14:57,276 --> 00:14:58,504
Maybe she was afraid.

116
00:14:58,578 --> 00:15:01,672
lf Karan would have seen me,
he would have rejected her.

117
00:15:01,747 --> 00:15:04,614
Why would l be threatened by you?
You already have a boyfriend.

118
00:15:04,684 --> 00:15:06,743
l have broken up with him.
- Why?

119
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:11,413
Did he do something wrong?
- He wanted to marry me.

120
00:15:16,095 --> 00:15:19,428
Sophia, giving us an engagement
party is not enough.

121
00:15:19,498 --> 00:15:23,491
You will have to tell us a secret.
- What?

122
00:15:23,569 --> 00:15:26,538
How did you entice
such a wealthy man?

123
00:15:32,245 --> 00:15:35,442
For your kind information,
Sophia didn't entice Karan.

124
00:15:35,514 --> 00:15:39,177
lt was Karan who enticed Sophia.
lsn't that true, Sophia?

125
00:15:39,252 --> 00:15:40,310
Whatever!

126
00:15:40,386 --> 00:15:43,787
l am happy that she will
have a nice husband!

127
00:15:44,056 --> 00:15:48,652
Tall, good looking, and
a millionaire! Cheers!

128
00:15:48,728 --> 00:15:49,786
Cheers!
- Cheers!

129
00:15:55,768 --> 00:15:58,430
So dude, finally your dreams
have materialised.

130
00:15:58,504 --> 00:16:00,335
All the credit goes
to Sophia, my friend.

131
00:16:00,406 --> 00:16:02,704
lf Sophia had not come in my life,

132
00:16:02,775 --> 00:16:04,333
l don't know what would
have happened.

133
00:16:05,177 --> 00:16:06,235
All the best!

134
00:16:09,582 --> 00:16:12,551
l am thinking of enticing
a billionaire.

135
00:16:12,652 --> 00:16:15,815
lf not a billionaire
then a millionaire.

136
00:16:16,088 --> 00:16:17,419
lt's the same thing.

137
00:16:20,593 --> 00:16:24,825
What a babe! What a smile!
What style! Amazing!

138
00:16:26,232 --> 00:16:27,756
All three of them are amazing!

139
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:30,097
Even a bit of her will
be good enough!

140
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:34,206
Talk softly! lf they hear us,
we will have to leave!

141
00:16:34,273 --> 00:16:35,365
Mad guy!

142
00:16:38,577 --> 00:16:39,635
Ladies and Gentlemen!

143
00:16:39,712 --> 00:16:42,579
Can l have a few moments
of your time, please?

144
00:16:42,648 --> 00:16:44,843
Today we have Ms. Sophia with us.

145
00:16:45,518 --> 00:16:48,180
She has come here to celebrate
her engagement.

146
00:16:48,254 --> 00:16:49,721
She is going to get married soon!

147
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:57,155
Young lady! There is an old custom
in Egypt for such an occasion.

148
00:16:57,229 --> 00:17:01,131
The bride to-be can
dance with any guy

149
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:05,864
of her choice for the last time.

150
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:08,871
The last dance of
her unmarried life.

151
00:17:09,542 --> 00:17:13,876
Whom do you want to dance
with? Excepting me!

152
00:17:15,281 --> 00:17:16,873
No, no! l can't dance!

153
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,145
Come on! You won't get
such a chance again!

154
00:17:19,218 --> 00:17:20,276
Yes, Sophia!

155
00:17:20,353 --> 00:17:22,321
After marriage you have to dance
to your husband's tune.

156
00:17:22,388 --> 00:17:24,754
Today make somebody else dance
to your tune! Please!

157
00:17:24,824 --> 00:17:26,155
Come on! Come on!
- Come on, Sophia!

158
00:17:26,225 --> 00:17:27,886
Come on! Go for it! Just do it!

159
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,151
lt will bring you luck
in your married life.

160
00:17:30,229 --> 00:17:31,787
Come on! Choose your partner.

161
00:17:53,185 --> 00:17:54,243
Sit!

162
00:18:03,796 --> 00:18:05,195
Ladies and Gentlemen!

163
00:18:05,264 --> 00:18:07,926
Sophia has selected
her dance partner!

164
00:18:09,602 --> 00:18:11,433
And here is the lucky man!

165
00:18:13,205 --> 00:18:14,263
Yeah!

166
00:18:22,615 --> 00:18:25,209
Go for it, man! Go for it, man!

167
00:18:29,722 --> 00:18:31,280
Come on, dude! Make a move!

168
00:18:31,724 --> 00:18:33,282
Why are you thinking so
much in the first round?

169
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:35,953
The entire game depends
on the first move.

170
00:18:50,242 --> 00:18:51,300
Yeah!

171
00:18:51,377 --> 00:18:52,435
Yeah!

172
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:01,577
Someday..

173
00:19:03,255 --> 00:19:08,921
Someday l will come in your path,
into your arms and your shelter.

174
00:19:08,994 --> 00:19:11,895
l will lose myself.

175
00:19:13,466 --> 00:19:16,993
Someday l will become yours.

176
00:19:19,672 --> 00:19:20,730
Someday..

177
00:19:21,474 --> 00:19:27,470
Someday l will come in your path,
into your arms and your shelter.

178
00:19:28,681 --> 00:19:30,444
l will lose myself.

179
00:19:31,851 --> 00:19:35,287
Someday l will become yours.

180
00:19:37,289 --> 00:19:42,693
This heart couldn't express it.

181
00:19:42,761 --> 00:19:47,289
This heart couldn't express it.

182
00:19:47,366 --> 00:19:52,963
This heart couldn't express it.

183
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:57,304
This heart couldn't express it.

184
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:19,690
You don't know how passionate
my love is.

185
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:32,739
You don't know how passionate
my love is.

186
00:20:36,682 --> 00:20:43,349
You are the dream l've been
dreaming for a long time.

187
00:20:44,924 --> 00:20:46,858
Every moment..

188
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,351
l will be in your memories,
your conversations,..

189
00:20:50,429 --> 00:20:54,024
..and intentions every moment.

190
00:20:54,099 --> 00:20:56,363
l will lose myself.

191
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:01,362
Someday l will become yours.

192
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:08,506
This heart couldn't express it.

193
00:21:08,581 --> 00:21:12,381
This heart couldn't express it.

194
00:21:37,476 --> 00:21:45,645
Those downcast eyes
drive me crazy.

195
00:21:50,022 --> 00:21:58,691
Those downcast eyes
drive me crazy.

196
00:22:00,032 --> 00:22:09,168
What can l say? A stranger
gives me pain.

197
00:22:10,909 --> 00:22:19,942
l will be in your dreams
and thoughts.

198
00:22:20,019 --> 00:22:22,180
l will lose myself.

199
00:22:23,789 --> 00:22:27,452
Someday l will become yours.

200
00:22:29,461 --> 00:22:34,626
This heart couldn't express it.

201
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:38,693
This heart couldn't express it.

202
00:24:16,068 --> 00:24:18,662
There is a bit of swelling.
lt will be fine by morning.

203
00:24:21,807 --> 00:24:23,138
l know you very well.

204
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,168
l am sure that while dancing

205
00:24:26,245 --> 00:24:27,303
he must have flirted with you.

206
00:24:27,579 --> 00:24:29,570
Loosing your temper..
you must have hit him.

207
00:24:30,983 --> 00:24:33,008
Sophia, you should
control your anger.

208
00:24:33,085 --> 00:24:37,613
Your anger can hurt you.
l don't want that to happen.

209
00:24:39,191 --> 00:24:44,322
Sophia, l get restless
if you are in trouble.

210
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,591
Why don't you go for plastic
surgery to erase this mark?

211
00:24:54,306 --> 00:24:55,603
Some marks are important.

212
00:24:58,677 --> 00:24:59,735
For guidance.

213
00:27:05,804 --> 00:27:07,738
Yes please. What would
you like to have, sir?

214
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,471
A lunch date with you.

215
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:12,968
Hi!

216
00:27:14,146 --> 00:27:15,841
How did you know l work here?

217
00:27:15,914 --> 00:27:17,905
Your friend told me.

218
00:27:24,356 --> 00:27:26,483
Hey! Hey! Excuse me!
Where are you going?

219
00:27:26,758 --> 00:27:27,816
Excuse me!

220
00:27:27,893 --> 00:27:29,258
What happened? Why are you
running away like this?

221
00:27:29,328 --> 00:27:30,761
l am engaged. l am going
to get married.

222
00:27:30,829 --> 00:27:31,887
Yes. But yesterday..

223
00:27:31,964 --> 00:27:33,989
lt was a custom. l had to do it.

224
00:27:34,066 --> 00:27:37,900
l only wanted to ask if you also felt
the same as l did, yesterday.

225
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:40,270
l told you! l am getting married!

226
00:27:41,139 --> 00:27:42,197
That's why l'm here!

227
00:27:43,108 --> 00:27:45,303
You'll spend all your
life with your husband.

228
00:27:45,377 --> 00:27:49,336
Can't you spend some time with
me before your wedding?

229
00:27:49,414 --> 00:27:50,506
That's impossible!

230
00:27:50,782 --> 00:27:52,272
One lunch?
- No!

231
00:27:52,351 --> 00:27:54,410
Coffee?
- No!

232
00:27:54,486 --> 00:27:56,010
Lemonade?
- No!

233
00:27:57,189 --> 00:27:59,783
Plain water?
- l said no!

234
00:27:59,858 --> 00:28:01,849
We won't even talk to each other!

235
00:28:01,927 --> 00:28:04,191
Please! We will sit
at separate tables!

236
00:28:04,262 --> 00:28:05,957
l will be at this corner;
you will be at that corner!

237
00:28:06,031 --> 00:28:07,794
We won't even look at each other!

238
00:28:07,866 --> 00:28:10,801
lf you pity me, just wave your hand.

239
00:28:10,869 --> 00:28:11,995
And l will pay the bill too..

240
00:28:15,307 --> 00:28:19,209
Why are you filming me?
- ln case you don't meet me again?

241
00:28:19,878 --> 00:28:22,540
You are right, l won't.

242
00:28:23,415 --> 00:28:26,145
Still l'll wait for you at Hotel
Blues in the afternoon.

243
00:28:26,218 --> 00:28:27,549
l won't come!

244
00:28:39,831 --> 00:28:40,889
Hi, Rohit!

245
00:28:40,966 --> 00:28:43,901
What happened? Did you meet her?
- Yes.

246
00:28:43,969 --> 00:28:47,097
So the matter has progressed!
Did you take her phone number?

247
00:28:49,508 --> 00:28:50,566
No. She didn't give it to me. And..

248
00:28:52,844 --> 00:28:55,972
Actually she refused to
meet me again. But l..

249
00:28:56,048 --> 00:29:00,849
What! And you didn't try? How
need to finish this job fast..

250
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:04,377
lt will take some time.
l am trying.

251
00:29:04,456 --> 00:29:08,984
Just trying is not enough. l want
results. And l want them fast.

252
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,638
Who is it?

253
00:30:06,918 --> 00:30:07,976
Hello!

254
00:31:06,378 --> 00:31:07,436
Of course, Mr. Sahani!

255
00:31:07,512 --> 00:31:09,309
The work is going on fine.

256
00:31:09,381 --> 00:31:12,646
lf there is no snag, we should
complete it within 2-3 months.

257
00:31:14,586 --> 00:31:17,555
Don't worry. You are the one who
is going to distribute it.

258
00:31:17,622 --> 00:31:19,146
Okay. Bye.

259
00:31:22,394 --> 00:31:25,727
What happened? Why are you so upset?
- Nothing.

260
00:31:27,332 --> 00:31:29,357
lf you want to lie,
then close your eyes.

261
00:31:29,434 --> 00:31:34,064
Because they reveal the truth. What
happened? What's the problem?

262
00:31:35,407 --> 00:31:38,001
Karan, when l was returning
from the mall,

263
00:31:38,076 --> 00:31:39,737
somebody was following me.

264
00:31:40,011 --> 00:31:42,741
l think Rakesh has come here.

265
00:31:43,014 --> 00:31:44,743
Rakesh is in a prison in Goa.

266
00:31:45,016 --> 00:31:47,382
And you had said that he is
serving a 3 year prison term.

267
00:31:48,587 --> 00:31:49,645
lt's your imagination..

268
00:31:50,021 --> 00:31:51,750
No. Somebody was there.

269
00:31:52,023 --> 00:31:54,685
When l turned around, somebody
was following me.

270
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:03,527
ls he the guy with whom
you danced that night?

271
00:32:08,273 --> 00:32:10,764
No. lt can't be him.

272
00:32:14,379 --> 00:32:15,539
Maybe it's my imagination.

273
00:32:16,548 --> 00:32:20,575
Don't worry. Nothing will happen
to you. l am with you.

274
00:32:30,762 --> 00:32:33,094
Good afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon.

275
00:32:34,232 --> 00:32:35,460
l am waiting for my date.
- Yeah.

276
00:32:35,533 --> 00:32:38,593
Can you quickly bring some
fresh flowers? - Sure, sir.

277
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:39,728
Thank you.

278
00:32:49,481 --> 00:32:51,142
l knew that you would come.

279
00:33:07,499 --> 00:33:10,764
Hey, Tyson! Why did you punch me?

280
00:33:11,102 --> 00:33:12,831
Why were you following
me yesterday?

281
00:33:13,104 --> 00:33:15,231
Following you?
Why would l follow you?

282
00:33:15,307 --> 00:33:18,105
People follow me. Creditors.

283
00:33:19,277 --> 00:33:20,676
Ma'am, the restaurant is there.

284
00:33:20,745 --> 00:33:22,269
Our lunch treat is still pending.

285
00:33:22,347 --> 00:33:24,781
Give me one reason why
l should say yes?

286
00:33:25,116 --> 00:33:26,481
Because l love you.

287
00:33:29,321 --> 00:33:31,653
Strange! ln 2 days you
fell in love with me?

288
00:33:31,723 --> 00:33:33,520
lt's not strange that
l fell in love.

289
00:33:33,591 --> 00:33:35,388
lt's strange that l told you this.

290
00:33:36,695 --> 00:33:37,753
l see!

291
00:33:43,335 --> 00:33:45,132
So tell me the colour of my eyes.

292
00:33:49,541 --> 00:33:51,133
When l saw you in the
pub for the first time,

293
00:33:51,209 --> 00:33:54,667
your eyes were coffee brown.

294
00:33:55,847 --> 00:33:59,613
Then when l saw you in Pizza hut,
they were dark brown.

295
00:34:00,652 --> 00:34:05,146
But when you laugh, there is a
silver shade with dark brown.

296
00:34:05,223 --> 00:34:06,281
And by God!

297
00:34:06,358 --> 00:34:10,158
When you get angry, they turn
red like traffic signals!

298
00:34:17,569 --> 00:34:19,537
Your are a good talker.

299
00:34:22,173 --> 00:34:23,231
Come here.

300
00:34:24,576 --> 00:34:25,668
Let's go to the medical store.

301
00:34:40,558 --> 00:34:41,616
lt hurts.

302
00:34:45,196 --> 00:34:47,187
l wish you had hit me here,
instead of here.

303
00:34:49,868 --> 00:34:50,926
Let's go.

304
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:54,930
You know, yesterday l lost
my job because of you.

305
00:34:55,206 --> 00:34:56,264
What are you saying?

306
00:34:56,608 --> 00:34:59,668
You should in fact thank me.
What kind of job was that?

307
00:34:59,744 --> 00:35:01,678
To hell with such a job!

308
00:35:01,746 --> 00:35:03,714
You talk as if you are the manager

309
00:35:03,782 --> 00:35:04,942
of some multinational company.

310
00:35:05,216 --> 00:35:08,379
What do you do? - l am an actor.
Right now l am unemployed.

311
00:35:08,453 --> 00:35:10,284
But l can handle unemployment well.

312
00:35:14,225 --> 00:35:16,216
lt's good to have lunch
at the right time.

313
00:35:16,294 --> 00:35:18,819
l am famished!

314
00:35:18,897 --> 00:35:21,388
Let's go. Today l will take
you wherever you want to go.

315
00:35:21,466 --> 00:35:22,956
Really?
- Yes!

316
00:35:30,775 --> 00:35:31,833
Hyatt?

317
00:35:33,244 --> 00:35:37,977
Okay. The food's good there.
Let's go. - Come.

318
00:35:43,755 --> 00:35:45,985
The restaurant is in the lobby.
Where are you taking me?

319
00:35:46,424 --> 00:35:47,482
Don't worry!

320
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:49,993
l won't misbehave with you
in the first meeting.

321
00:35:52,597 --> 00:35:53,996
Whenever l don't have money,

322
00:35:54,265 --> 00:35:55,994
l have meals in fancy restaurants.

323
00:35:56,868 --> 00:35:58,893
What do you mean?
- Just wait and watch.

324
00:36:18,456 --> 00:36:19,650
Hello. Room service.
- Yes.

325
00:36:19,724 --> 00:36:22,420
l am calling from 2306. Can you
take my order for lunch please?

326
00:36:23,461 --> 00:36:29,525
1 salad, 1 smoked salmon,
and 1 vegetable pasta.

327
00:36:29,901 --> 00:36:32,893
Yeah. And can you send one bottle
of red wine with that, please?

328
00:36:32,971 --> 00:36:34,768
Thank you. One second.

329
00:36:34,839 --> 00:36:37,034
Sweetheart, what will
you have for dessert?

330
00:36:37,308 --> 00:36:39,037
Nothing. Okay.

331
00:36:39,711 --> 00:36:41,576
Black forest cake.

332
00:36:41,646 --> 00:36:44,638
And one black forest cake please.

333
00:36:45,416 --> 00:36:47,577
Thank you. And we are
going for our bath now.

334
00:36:47,652 --> 00:36:48,710
So please don't disturb us.

335
00:36:48,786 --> 00:36:50,720
Tell the waiter to leave the
lunch outside the door.

336
00:36:50,788 --> 00:36:51,846
Thank you.

337
00:36:53,992 --> 00:36:55,050
How is that?

338
00:37:11,676 --> 00:37:13,007
Some red wine.

339
00:37:14,646 --> 00:37:16,079
l have come here before.

340
00:37:16,347 --> 00:37:18,838
But l am really enjoying this
more, sitting here,..

341
00:37:18,917 --> 00:37:21,010
.. having lunch with
you.. and talking.

342
00:37:22,053 --> 00:37:23,350
How did you think of this?

343
00:37:23,421 --> 00:37:25,753
l have worked in many hotels.

344
00:37:25,823 --> 00:37:27,882
And was sacked because of this!

345
00:37:29,961 --> 00:37:32,395
For your kind information, l have
changed 12 jobs in 6 months.

346
00:38:05,663 --> 00:38:07,062
By the way, my name is Sophia.

347
00:38:07,131 --> 00:38:08,792
People call me Sophie.

348
00:38:09,801 --> 00:38:14,397
l am Vicky. And People
call me Vicky.

349
00:38:17,108 --> 00:38:18,700
lt's a pleasure meeting you, Vicky.

350
00:38:18,776 --> 00:38:21,609
Not many people say that
after meeting me.

351
00:38:23,815 --> 00:38:28,149
Hey! Who is it? Who are you..
and what are you doing?

352
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:31,411
Hey stop, where are you running?

353
00:38:31,489 --> 00:38:34,424
Hey boy! Where are you
running, stop!

354
00:38:34,492 --> 00:38:37,620
Stop! Hey! Stop! Stop!

355
00:38:41,733 --> 00:38:42,791
Hey stop! Stop!

356
00:38:42,867 --> 00:38:44,494
Sir, we were only having lunch.

357
00:38:44,569 --> 00:38:46,434
Please try to understand.
- Come! Come!

358
00:38:59,784 --> 00:39:02,446
Very smart trick! Do you
have any other tricks?

359
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,454
Ma'am, l am not a criminal.
l was just having fun.

360
00:39:04,522 --> 00:39:06,490
l was just passing time.
- Passing time?

361
00:39:06,557 --> 00:39:08,718
Now you will pass your
time in Dubai's jail.

362
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:33,808
l did it, come, let's go.

363
00:39:33,885 --> 00:39:34,943
Come on!

364
00:39:52,103 --> 00:39:54,037
Calm down! Don't panic!

365
00:39:54,105 --> 00:39:55,163
lt was a false alarm.

366
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:57,833
The security just switched
the alarm off.

367
00:40:57,969 --> 00:40:59,596
lt's been ages since l have
enjoyed myself so much.

368
00:41:01,072 --> 00:41:02,630
This is the best day of my life.

369
00:41:05,643 --> 00:41:06,701
Where is your jacket?

370
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:09,978
l left it in the hotel.

371
00:41:14,819 --> 00:41:15,877
Take this.

372
00:41:20,992 --> 00:41:24,826
Should l tell you something? This
is the best day of my life too.

373
00:41:27,999 --> 00:41:29,933
After today we will
be friends forever.

374
00:41:30,802 --> 00:41:33,600
Wow! At least you consider
me your friend!

375
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:46,908
To our friendship!

376
00:41:51,322 --> 00:41:52,619
Bye-bye!

377
00:42:05,136 --> 00:42:07,229
Yes, Rohit.
- Did you meet Sophia?

378
00:42:07,305 --> 00:42:08,897
We were together the whole day.

379
00:42:08,973 --> 00:42:11,635
Good! This means you
are progressing.

380
00:42:13,911 --> 00:42:15,173
Rohit, l don't like this.

381
00:42:16,247 --> 00:42:17,646
lt's not about your
likes and dislikes..

382
00:42:17,715 --> 00:42:19,182
Just do what you have
been told to do!

383
00:42:20,051 --> 00:42:21,382
The work should be completed soon.

384
00:42:21,652 --> 00:42:22,710
That's it.

385
00:42:50,081 --> 00:42:51,412
You scared me!

386
00:42:53,351 --> 00:42:54,409
The jacket is nice.

387
00:42:55,686 --> 00:42:59,178
lt's my friend Nikki's jacket.
- Where is yours?

388
00:43:00,958 --> 00:43:02,687
l forgot it at work.

389
00:43:08,866 --> 00:43:12,097
Let's go and get your jacket.
- l will collect it tomorrow.

390
00:43:12,169 --> 00:43:13,864
Why tomorrow? Let's go now.

391
00:43:13,938 --> 00:43:15,428
What has happened to you?

392
00:43:15,706 --> 00:43:17,697
l told you that l will collect
it tomorrow when l go to work!

393
00:43:17,775 --> 00:43:19,709
You didn't go to work today.

394
00:43:19,777 --> 00:43:21,972
l called Burger King.

395
00:43:22,046 --> 00:43:24,708
They sacked you from
the job yesterday.

396
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:28,441
You are spying on me.
Don't you trust me?

397
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,449
l don't like it when
somebody spies on me.

398
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:36,090
You are getting me wrong.
l was worried about you.

399
00:43:37,228 --> 00:43:39,128
You yourself told me that
somebody was following you.

400
00:43:40,231 --> 00:43:43,291
So when you were late today,
l called Burger King.

401
00:43:44,402 --> 00:43:45,460
l am sorry.

402
00:43:47,738 --> 00:43:48,796
Let's go.

403
00:43:50,808 --> 00:43:52,742
Do you know why l was eagerly
waiting for you?

404
00:43:53,744 --> 00:43:56,736
To give you good news. l have
finished all the preparations..

405
00:43:56,814 --> 00:43:58,975
l have even got the form
from the marriage bureau.

406
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:00,984
We will get married on the 10th.

407
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:03,478
So soon?

408
00:44:06,157 --> 00:44:08,216
lt's okay with me if you don't
want to get married now..

409
00:44:08,292 --> 00:44:10,055
l will postpone the wedding.

410
00:44:10,127 --> 00:44:12,425
lt isn't necessary to get
married on the 10th.

411
00:44:12,496 --> 00:44:14,327
We can fix some other date.

412
00:44:15,266 --> 00:44:18,497
No. l don't want you
to change the date.

413
00:44:19,437 --> 00:44:20,495
Are you sure?

414
00:44:23,174 --> 00:44:25,074
Then sign on these papers.

415
00:44:30,514 --> 00:44:31,776
Here too.

416
00:44:35,886 --> 00:44:38,150
You must be tired. Go and rest.

417
00:44:48,499 --> 00:44:49,932
Bye, guys. We will meet tomorrow.

418
00:44:50,001 --> 00:44:52,993
Vicky, take your camera.
- Yes.

419
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:55,038
Why? Aren't you going to
meet Sophia tomorrow?

420
00:44:55,106 --> 00:44:56,539
lf she wants to meet me,
then sure l will.

421
00:44:56,807 --> 00:45:00,004
Vicky, its better to take
advantage of the situation.

422
00:45:00,077 --> 00:45:03,205
Otherwise you might
lose your chance.

423
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,214
You!
- See you.

424
00:45:05,282 --> 00:45:06,544
Come on!

425
00:45:23,501 --> 00:45:24,559
What a nice surprise!

426
00:45:24,835 --> 00:45:27,235
Welcome to my house

427
00:45:27,304 --> 00:45:28,566
How did you get my address?

428
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,572
From the electricity
bill in your jacket.

429
00:45:31,976 --> 00:45:34,570
Oh God! Come on in!

430
00:45:35,246 --> 00:45:38,181
No! l just came to
return your jacket.

431
00:45:39,917 --> 00:45:41,851
lf l had not returned home,

432
00:45:41,919 --> 00:45:43,853
would you have left just like that?

433
00:45:47,858 --> 00:45:48,916
Come in!

434
00:45:59,203 --> 00:46:02,229
l live alone. So..

435
00:46:02,306 --> 00:46:06,106
No, no! Your house
reminds me of mine.

436
00:46:06,177 --> 00:46:07,235
Really?

437
00:46:13,884 --> 00:46:16,352
Whose picture is this?
- My daddy's.

438
00:46:17,555 --> 00:46:18,613
Where does he live?

439
00:46:28,933 --> 00:46:29,991
l will leave now.

440
00:46:32,303 --> 00:46:37,536
Sophia, l still have the
wine bottle you gave me.

441
00:46:55,059 --> 00:46:56,583
My dad too had his wine in a mug.

442
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:59,527
ls that so? My daddy had it
directly from the bottle.

443
00:46:59,597 --> 00:47:00,928
He didn't like anything
to come between the bottle..

444
00:47:00,998 --> 00:47:02,056
..and the lips. Cheers!

445
00:47:08,939 --> 00:47:12,966
Oh no! Not again! Why
do you always film me?

446
00:47:13,944 --> 00:47:16,435
Because l want to keep all the
moments of my life alive.

447
00:47:17,548 --> 00:47:19,607
These lovely moments are never lost.

448
00:47:19,683 --> 00:47:23,175
With this l can pause, rewind
and fast-forward.

449
00:47:24,955 --> 00:47:28,049
ln the future if
l marry a rich girl,

450
00:47:28,125 --> 00:47:31,288
and feel lonely,

451
00:47:32,296 --> 00:47:34,628
l can play this to come
out of the blues.

452
00:47:37,201 --> 00:47:40,193
Tell me about yourself.
How did you meet Karan?

453
00:47:41,972 --> 00:47:45,567
Around 6 months ago, l was
a waitress in a club.

454
00:47:45,643 --> 00:47:48,168
Once an insolent man
tried to harass me.

455
00:47:52,583 --> 00:47:54,380
And Karan was watching all this.

456
00:47:54,451 --> 00:47:56,715
We met there for the first time.

457
00:47:58,656 --> 00:47:59,714
Now it's my turn!

458
00:48:04,061 --> 00:48:05,187
You were telling me something
about your dad,

459
00:48:05,262 --> 00:48:06,320
but you stopped.

460
00:48:06,997 --> 00:48:08,055
Tell me.

461
00:48:11,468 --> 00:48:14,528
He was an actor. He wanted
to be a big star.

462
00:48:16,407 --> 00:48:18,034
Finally he became a star.

463
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:21,735
People say that after
death we become stars.

464
00:48:22,746 --> 00:48:24,043
He committed suicide.

465
00:48:26,517 --> 00:48:28,417
After struggling his whole life,

466
00:48:28,485 --> 00:48:31,283
he neither achieved fame
nor made any money.

467
00:48:33,524 --> 00:48:37,255
So l thought l would become an
actor and fulfil his dream.

468
00:48:38,729 --> 00:48:44,190
And 4 years after struggling
in Mumbai, l am finally here.

469
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:53,240
What is this mark?
- l..

470
00:48:53,310 --> 00:48:55,778
l am sorry. l didn't mean to..

471
00:48:56,447 --> 00:48:57,778
No. That's okay.

472
00:49:00,251 --> 00:49:03,709
When l was in Goa, a
guy named Rakesh ,

473
00:49:03,787 --> 00:49:05,778
would follow me the whole day.

474
00:49:06,457 --> 00:49:08,550
One day l threatened
to lodge a complaint

475
00:49:08,626 --> 00:49:10,787
with the police, and
he became violent.

476
00:49:31,282 --> 00:49:35,241
So you came to Dubai.
And here you met Karan.

477
00:49:37,154 --> 00:49:38,212
He is rich, isn't he?

478
00:49:39,256 --> 00:49:41,486
He is very rich. He is
a multi-millionaire.

479
00:49:43,494 --> 00:49:45,223
Then why do you work?

480
00:49:45,596 --> 00:49:48,087
l prefer working to
meet my own expenses.

481
00:49:49,767 --> 00:49:50,825
Yeah! Right!

482
00:49:51,502 --> 00:49:54,437
Do you think l am marrying
Karan for his money?

483
00:49:55,706 --> 00:49:56,832
Then why are you marrying him?

484
00:49:57,508 --> 00:49:58,839
Because l love him.

485
00:50:01,578 --> 00:50:03,102
Then what are you
doing here with me?

486
00:50:10,521 --> 00:50:11,579
Now l will leave.

487
00:51:02,506 --> 00:51:03,564
Sophia, l love you.

488
00:52:27,758 --> 00:52:28,952
l can't do this.

489
00:52:43,674 --> 00:52:45,835
Hello, Rohit.
- Yes.

490
00:52:45,909 --> 00:52:49,845
l want to talk to you urgently.
l can't do this anymore.

491
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:54,842
Are you mad? Don't forget.
You have signed a contract.

492
00:52:54,918 --> 00:52:57,648
To hell with you and your contract!

493
00:52:58,889 --> 00:53:01,915
l will repay your money
along with interest!

494
00:53:02,793 --> 00:53:06,991
l can't.. l can't play
with this girl's life!

495
00:53:39,759 --> 00:53:42,159
l wish you had slapped me
here instead of there.

496
00:53:48,034 --> 00:53:51,834
Know something? This is the
best year of my life too!

497
00:54:32,479 --> 00:54:35,471
Are you mad, this girl has
fallen for you big time,

498
00:54:35,548 --> 00:54:36,674
and you are running away from her.

499
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:40,542
Are you gay or something? lf you
are, let's keep our distance!

500
00:54:41,087 --> 00:54:44,147
Stop your nonsense, she is about
to get married in 5 days.

501
00:54:44,491 --> 00:54:46,755
So, you are not going to
perform the ceremony.

502
00:54:46,893 --> 00:54:48,554
Why are you so tense?

503
00:54:48,828 --> 00:54:50,489
And if you do want to dump her,

504
00:54:50,563 --> 00:54:53,555
give her some practice
for the wedding night.

505
00:54:54,167 --> 00:54:58,228
You son of a bitch, lf you ever
speak about Sophia like that.. l'll..

506
00:54:58,505 --> 00:55:00,564
We are joking dude..

507
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:03,700
Vicky, are you in love with her?

508
00:55:09,582 --> 00:55:13,245
l will not do anything
to harm Sophia.

509
00:55:15,722 --> 00:55:17,713
ln fact, l won't ever
meet her again.

510
00:55:23,596 --> 00:55:24,654
What do you think?

511
00:55:24,998 --> 00:55:26,260
lt seems like he is in love.

512
00:55:27,534 --> 00:55:29,525
We will have to think of something

513
00:55:29,602 --> 00:55:30,796
to bring a happy ending
to his love story.

514
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:05,898
My phone didn't ring, so
who were you calling?

515
00:56:06,039 --> 00:56:07,700
My friend Sheetal.

516
00:56:09,642 --> 00:56:12,236
Ms. Gomes, today l will
have lunch here.

517
00:56:12,579 --> 00:56:13,773
With pleasure, sir.

518
00:56:14,581 --> 00:56:16,640
Get two wine glasses please.
- Sure.

519
00:56:29,662 --> 00:56:32,187
'My dad used to drink wine in a mug.
- Really.'

520
00:56:32,265 --> 00:56:34,256
'My dad used to drink directly
from the bottle,

521
00:56:34,334 --> 00:56:35,596
he didn't like anything

522
00:56:35,668 --> 00:56:36,862
to come between his
lips and the wine.'

523
00:56:42,342 --> 00:56:45,607
Wine glasses, honey,
we are drinking wine,

524
00:56:45,678 --> 00:56:46,736
not tea or coffee.

525
00:57:01,828 --> 00:57:05,355
Karan, tell me something,
what colour are my eyes?

526
00:57:06,633 --> 00:57:07,691
Black or dark brown.

527
00:57:11,704 --> 00:57:13,695
What is the matter, why are
you asking such questions?

528
00:57:15,708 --> 00:57:16,766
Nothing.

529
00:57:25,718 --> 00:57:27,117
So what have you decided?

530
00:57:27,787 --> 00:57:29,379
l don't know what to do.

531
00:57:30,857 --> 00:57:33,655
There is Karan, who loves me a lot.

532
00:57:33,726 --> 00:57:35,717
And there is Vicky,

533
00:57:36,062 --> 00:57:38,121
with whom l am very comfortable.

534
00:57:39,666 --> 00:57:43,193
Karan makes me feel good, but
l feel happier with Vicky.

535
00:57:43,870 --> 00:57:46,270
lf you will try to solve
this with your intellect,

536
00:57:46,339 --> 00:57:47,863
your problems will get worse.

537
00:57:48,007 --> 00:57:51,340
This is a matter of the heart,
do what your heart says.

538
00:57:52,745 --> 00:57:55,339
Hey cheer up; it is not
the end of the world.

539
00:57:55,415 --> 00:57:58,009
Come on, let's go home
and talk comfortably.

540
00:57:58,751 --> 00:57:59,809
l will come some other day.

541
00:57:59,886 --> 00:58:01,945
Today l'm going to the beach
festival with Karan.

542
00:58:18,037 --> 00:58:23,373
Ladies and gentlemen..

543
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:28,443
We present the next
performer Vicky Malhotra.

544
00:59:01,881 --> 00:59:04,281
Love is a test.

545
00:59:04,350 --> 00:59:06,818
l am in love with you.

546
00:59:06,886 --> 00:59:09,286
My love is crazy.

547
00:59:09,355 --> 00:59:11,482
My love is different.

548
00:59:11,824 --> 00:59:16,158
My loneliness is asking me
to find a new destination.

549
00:59:16,295 --> 00:59:18,763
Come and unite your hearts.

550
00:59:18,831 --> 00:59:20,958
Come and unite your hearts.

551
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:23,762
Come and unite your hearts.

552
00:59:23,836 --> 00:59:25,963
Come and unite your hearts.

553
00:59:46,392 --> 00:59:50,385
l search for you everywhere,
my beloved.

554
00:59:51,330 --> 00:59:55,198
You are my life; l swear
you're my sweet heart.

555
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:04,876
l search for you everywhere,
my beloved.

556
01:00:05,878 --> 01:00:10,008
You are my life; l swear
you're my sweet heart.

557
01:00:10,149 --> 01:00:15,553
My peace is lost in
your restlessness.

558
01:00:15,888 --> 01:00:20,291
Your beloved has been mesmerised
by your beauty.

559
01:00:20,359 --> 01:00:24,819
My loneliness is asking me
to find a new destination.

560
01:00:24,897 --> 01:00:27,229
Come and unite your hearts.

561
01:00:27,366 --> 01:00:29,561
Come and unite your hearts.

562
01:00:29,902 --> 01:00:32,302
Come and unite your hearts.

563
01:00:32,438 --> 01:00:34,565
Come and unite your hearts.

564
01:01:03,469 --> 01:01:07,462
lt could not be hidden,
it was revealed.

565
01:01:08,207 --> 01:01:12,337
l devoted my life to love.

566
01:01:18,017 --> 01:01:22,147
lt could not be hidden,
it was revealed.

567
01:01:22,955 --> 01:01:27,016
l devoted my life to love.

568
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:32,556
Living without you is a punishment.

569
01:01:32,899 --> 01:01:37,495
You don't know what my desire is.

570
01:01:37,904 --> 01:01:42,034
My loneliness is asking me
to find a new destination.

571
01:01:42,175 --> 01:01:44,439
Come and unite your hearts.

572
01:01:44,510 --> 01:01:46,637
Come on.
- Come and unite your hearts.

573
01:01:46,979 --> 01:01:49,243
Come and unite your hearts.

574
01:01:49,315 --> 01:01:51,909
Come and unite your hearts.
- That's right.

575
01:01:51,984 --> 01:01:54,111
Come and unite your hearts.

576
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:56,652
Come and unite your hearts.

577
01:02:42,435 --> 01:02:44,494
Hi Sophia.
- Hi?

578
01:02:44,570 --> 01:02:45,969
For the past three days
l have been calling you.

579
01:02:46,038 --> 01:02:47,232
You neither pick up the
phone nor call back.

580
01:02:47,306 --> 01:02:48,364
And you are here.

581
01:02:48,441 --> 01:02:50,705
l was saving money to
buy you a present.

582
01:02:51,310 --> 01:02:52,709
You are about to get married.

583
01:02:58,584 --> 01:03:00,051
Don't you love me?

584
01:03:02,121 --> 01:03:04,988
You know, my friends say that l
have got this really mean habit

585
01:03:05,057 --> 01:03:06,456
of flirting with girls.

586
01:03:09,061 --> 01:03:10,119
So whatever happened between us

587
01:03:10,196 --> 01:03:11,993
that day in your house,
it was nothing serious.

588
01:03:13,666 --> 01:03:18,262
Sophia, you are about to get
married in a few days.

589
01:03:18,337 --> 01:03:19,998
Now be serious, if anyone hears you,

590
01:03:20,072 --> 01:03:22,063
they will say you have loose morals.

591
01:03:23,676 --> 01:03:26,008
Yes, we can still sit together
and drink wine.

592
01:03:26,345 --> 01:03:29,212
Once you are married, it's like
having a license to cheat.

593
01:03:29,282 --> 01:03:30,749
After that we can meet
whenever we want.

594
01:03:31,150 --> 01:03:32,208
l won't mind it.

595
01:03:35,021 --> 01:03:38,149
Why do you girls get so angry
over such small things?

596
01:03:43,562 --> 01:03:46,030
Come on Sophia, don't make a scene

597
01:03:46,098 --> 01:03:47,565
in front of everyone by crying.

598
01:04:08,254 --> 01:04:10,381
Sophia, what happened?

599
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:12,452
Why are you so angry?

600
01:04:13,592 --> 01:04:14,786
Did l make a mistake?

601
01:04:15,061 --> 01:04:17,325
No, l am angry with myself.

602
01:04:19,398 --> 01:04:23,129
What happened, Sophia, tell me.

603
01:04:26,138 --> 01:04:27,799
l have hidden something from you.

604
01:04:28,341 --> 01:04:29,399
What?

605
01:04:30,142 --> 01:04:32,076
That day, when l returned
late at night,

606
01:04:32,144 --> 01:04:33,611
l was with Vicky.

607
01:04:35,748 --> 01:04:42,415
Who is Vicky? - The one l had
danced with at the party.

608
01:04:43,289 --> 01:04:45,223
l went on a date with him too.

609
01:04:45,291 --> 01:04:47,623
Even though l was engaged to you.

610
01:04:50,162 --> 01:04:52,153
l don't know why,
l couldn't stop myself.

611
01:04:53,165 --> 01:04:55,633
l lied to you, l deceived you.

612
01:04:56,769 --> 01:04:57,827
You did not deceive me.

613
01:05:00,106 --> 01:05:02,233
You would have, if you hadn't
made this confession.

614
01:05:03,709 --> 01:05:05,176
Everyone makes mistakes.

615
01:05:06,579 --> 01:05:08,103
l am mature enough to understand

616
01:05:08,180 --> 01:05:09,374
..the difference between
a mistake and betrayal

617
01:05:11,650 --> 01:05:12,708
l love you.

618
01:05:17,189 --> 01:05:20,124
lf you still need time
to make up your mind,

619
01:05:20,192 --> 01:05:21,250
l will postpone the wedding.

620
01:05:23,129 --> 01:05:25,324
And if you still have
feelings for that man ,

621
01:05:25,398 --> 01:05:28,333
believe me, l will move out of
your way and unite both of you

622
01:05:32,138 --> 01:05:33,605
l want to see you happy.

623
01:05:38,744 --> 01:05:39,870
Why are you so good?

624
01:05:42,214 --> 01:05:44,273
Why don't you get angry like others?

625
01:05:46,685 --> 01:05:48,346
Why are you so understanding?

626
01:06:13,179 --> 01:06:14,237
Welcome dude.

627
01:06:14,313 --> 01:06:16,907
Sophia my darling,
you look gorgeous.

628
01:06:19,852 --> 01:06:20,910
Thank you.

629
01:06:21,187 --> 01:06:23,655
You are looking beautiful.

630
01:06:23,722 --> 01:06:26,247
So sweet, thank you.

631
01:06:38,604 --> 01:06:39,662
Shall we?

632
01:06:52,885 --> 01:06:57,549
He is rich, right? - Yes, he is,
he is a multi-millionaire.

633
01:06:58,891 --> 01:07:00,620
Then why do you need to work?

634
01:07:00,693 --> 01:07:02,888
Because l like to work
for my own expenses.

635
01:07:04,230 --> 01:07:05,288
Yeah right.

636
01:07:05,364 --> 01:07:08,299
Do you think l am marrying
Karan for his money?

637
01:07:09,235 --> 01:07:12,500
Then why are you marrying him?
- Because l love him.

638
01:07:13,305 --> 01:07:15,239
Then what are you doing
here with me?

639
01:07:42,868 --> 01:07:46,269
Mr. Karan Oberoi, do you
accept Sophia D'Costa,

640
01:07:46,338 --> 01:07:47,862
as your lawfully wedded wife.

641
01:07:51,343 --> 01:07:52,401
l do.

642
01:07:53,946 --> 01:07:55,675
And you Ms. Sophia D'Costa,

643
01:07:56,282 --> 01:08:00,013
do you accept Karan Oberoi as
your lawfully wedded husband?

644
01:08:14,366 --> 01:08:16,766
l repeat, do you
Ms. Sophia D'Costa,

645
01:08:16,835 --> 01:08:20,566
accept Mr. Karan Oberoi as your
lawfully wedded husband.

646
01:08:27,646 --> 01:08:29,375
No, l don't.

647
01:09:16,962 --> 01:09:18,896
You lied to me.

648
01:09:20,432 --> 01:09:22,423
You love me.

649
01:09:24,036 --> 01:09:26,504
You love me and l love you too.

650
01:12:22,948 --> 01:12:24,006
Come in, Sam.

651
01:12:26,885 --> 01:12:27,943
Hello sir.

652
01:12:33,892 --> 01:12:35,951
Sir, these are the DVD's
of the past two days.

653
01:12:43,168 --> 01:12:46,695
Sam, stop following
Sophia from today.

654
01:12:48,574 --> 01:12:49,632
Okay sir.

655
01:12:51,643 --> 01:12:52,701
Sir, can l ask you something?

656
01:12:54,179 --> 01:12:57,637
Three months ago, you hired
our Detective Agency..

657
01:12:57,716 --> 01:13:00,310
..because you were worried
about Sophia's security.

658
01:13:01,653 --> 01:13:04,645
But she began an affair
with a boy named Vicky.

659
01:13:06,258 --> 01:13:09,318
l gave you video tapes as proof.
- That doesn't concern you

660
01:13:10,262 --> 01:13:11,320
You will not understand.

661
01:13:13,265 --> 01:13:16,132
Send me the bill;
l will settle your account.

662
01:13:16,602 --> 01:13:17,660
Yes sir.

663
01:13:40,025 --> 01:13:41,151
How do l look?

664
01:13:44,096 --> 01:13:45,154
Cool.

665
01:13:45,697 --> 01:13:48,632
See, not just you but your
clothes suit me too.

666
01:13:59,778 --> 01:14:02,838
No sir, l cannot do this.

667
01:14:13,191 --> 01:14:16,649
Sophia, l have hidden
something from you.

668
01:14:16,728 --> 01:14:19,856
l know, it was you who
always followed me,

669
01:14:19,932 --> 01:14:21,399
..but l forgive you for that.

670
01:14:23,802 --> 01:14:25,667
lf you hadn't, how would..

671
01:14:25,737 --> 01:14:27,728
l have found you?

672
01:14:28,340 --> 01:14:30,001
No Sophia, l want to
say something else.

673
01:14:30,075 --> 01:14:34,409
l know, that day at
the Dubai festival,

674
01:14:34,746 --> 01:14:35,804
you broke my heart on purpose,

675
01:14:35,881 --> 01:14:36,939
so that l would marry Karan.

676
01:14:38,216 --> 01:14:40,684
And l would have,
if l hadn't met your friends

677
01:14:40,752 --> 01:14:42,947
Siddharth and Ronnie
outside the church.

678
01:14:45,757 --> 01:14:47,952
'Do you know why Vicky
broke your heart?

679
01:14:48,026 --> 01:14:49,687
For you to go away from him.'

680
01:14:49,761 --> 01:14:52,696
'Vicky loves you a lot,
he wants you to be happy

681
01:14:52,764 --> 01:14:55,096
with Karan, to lead a happy life.'

682
01:15:01,707 --> 01:15:02,765
'Shall we.'

683
01:15:05,310 --> 01:15:08,711
Both of them told me you were
sacrificing your love,

684
01:15:08,780 --> 01:15:09,838
for my happiness.

685
01:15:09,915 --> 01:15:10,973
Sophia..

686
01:15:12,050 --> 01:15:15,315
You know everything about
the one you love.

687
01:15:16,788 --> 01:15:18,722
Where are you going?
- To meet Karan.

688
01:15:18,857 --> 01:15:20,722
After what l did to him yesterday,

689
01:15:20,792 --> 01:15:22,123
he must be very hurt.

690
01:15:23,395 --> 01:15:25,124
l am going to apologise to him.

691
01:15:25,197 --> 01:15:27,722
l don't know why but l feel
he will forgive me.

692
01:16:32,397 --> 01:16:34,865
Karan.
- Get out of here.

693
01:16:38,336 --> 01:16:42,136
l realised yesterday that
l love Vicky. - Get out!

694
01:16:42,941 --> 01:16:44,272
What else do you want now?

695
01:16:45,077 --> 01:16:47,204
Yesterday you made a mockery
of me in front of everyone!

696
01:16:48,013 --> 01:16:52,541
l asked you, not once,
l asked you many times.

697
01:16:53,885 --> 01:16:55,147
Didn't you realise then?

698
01:16:57,889 --> 01:16:59,356
Karan..
- Get out!

699
01:17:02,894 --> 01:17:03,952
Get out.

700
01:18:07,959 --> 01:18:09,893
People say that l have gone mad.

701
01:18:11,363 --> 01:18:16,494
l have everything
- a business, cars, bungalows,

702
01:18:17,636 --> 01:18:19,035
money, everything.

703
01:18:21,106 --> 01:18:23,097
And yet, l don't have anything

704
01:18:25,443 --> 01:18:29,379
because you are not with me.

705
01:18:35,987 --> 01:18:42,324
People say this is the easiest
way to end your problems.

706
01:18:44,062 --> 01:18:51,332
But today l realised how much
courage it takes to do this.

707
01:18:56,474 --> 01:18:58,533
Look, my hands are trembling.

708
01:19:05,016 --> 01:19:11,012
l love you Sophia,
l cannot live without you.

709
01:19:11,289 --> 01:19:13,689
l can't live without you.

710
01:19:19,030 --> 01:19:20,554
l have always loved you.

711
01:20:00,134 --> 01:20:03,535
What should l say sir,
my master was a good man,

712
01:20:03,604 --> 01:20:05,265
he was such a good man.

713
01:20:05,473 --> 01:20:08,135
Now what will l do in this house?

714
01:20:22,223 --> 01:20:23,281
What has happened to him?

715
01:20:24,291 --> 01:20:25,485
He has committed suicide.

716
01:20:28,229 --> 01:20:30,561
No, Karan!
- Stop, you can't go!

717
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:32,290
Karan!

718
01:20:32,366 --> 01:20:33,560
Leave me alone!

719
01:20:33,634 --> 01:20:35,158
Please listen to me.
- Let me go!

720
01:20:35,236 --> 01:20:38,364
Please listen to me, please.
- Leave me alone!

721
01:20:40,241 --> 01:20:41,299
Please go out.

722
01:20:58,526 --> 01:20:59,584
Vicky!

723
01:21:00,394 --> 01:21:01,452
Vicky!

724
01:21:04,331 --> 01:21:07,198
What happened, Sophia,
why are you so scared?

725
01:21:08,269 --> 01:21:11,204
Karan is dead.
- What?

726
01:21:12,273 --> 01:21:13,672
l killed him.

727
01:21:15,276 --> 01:21:16,937
He died because of me.

728
01:21:18,279 --> 01:21:19,337
What are you saying?

729
01:21:20,281 --> 01:21:21,873
Karan committed suicide.

730
01:21:23,551 --> 01:21:25,485
He shot himself.

731
01:21:28,289 --> 01:21:29,483
Oh My God.

732
01:21:31,292 --> 01:21:32,623
All this has happened
because of me.

733
01:21:33,294 --> 01:21:37,560
l am responsible for
all this, only me.

734
01:21:37,631 --> 01:21:39,223
You didn't do anything Sophia,
all this has happened

735
01:21:40,301 --> 01:21:42,235
because of Rohit and me.

736
01:21:45,306 --> 01:21:46,705
l will have to inform Rohit.

737
01:21:47,374 --> 01:21:50,434
Rohit, who is Rohit?

738
01:21:53,714 --> 01:21:55,648
Vicky, tell me what is going on.

739
01:21:57,318 --> 01:22:00,583
Believe me, l wanted to
tell you everything,

740
01:22:00,654 --> 01:22:01,712
but l did not get a chance.

741
01:22:03,457 --> 01:22:07,985
l swear l did not want
to do this job.

742
01:22:09,330 --> 01:22:10,388
What job?

743
01:22:14,468 --> 01:22:16,993
Vicky, tell me everything.

744
01:22:24,411 --> 01:22:29,405
l came into your life
because l needed money.

745
01:22:30,951 --> 01:22:34,944
Few months ago in Mumbai, when
l was working as an actor..

746
01:22:36,357 --> 01:22:38,348
..l saw an ad in the newspaper.

747
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:42,352
Then l immediately sent my resume
to the production company.

748
01:22:44,565 --> 01:22:46,999
l was short listed after giving
three round of audition.

749
01:22:48,836 --> 01:22:50,303
Now finally, l had to meet
the director and..

750
01:22:50,371 --> 01:22:52,896
..the producer of the film.

751
01:22:56,377 --> 01:22:57,435
Come in.

752
01:22:58,979 --> 01:23:02,039
Hi Vicky, l am Siddharth.
- And l am Ronnie.

753
01:23:02,316 --> 01:23:04,045
We are the assistant directors
of this movie.

754
01:23:04,318 --> 01:23:05,979
We are the producers
of this film too.

755
01:23:06,387 --> 01:23:07,445
Nice to meet you sir.
- Nice to meet you.

756
01:23:08,389 --> 01:23:11,449
And this is the director of our
film, Mr. Rohit Shroff.

757
01:23:18,399 --> 01:23:19,525
You can call me Rohit.

758
01:23:20,401 --> 01:23:21,459
Okay sir.

759
01:23:21,669 --> 01:23:23,728
l have seen your bio-data
and your show reel.

760
01:23:24,538 --> 01:23:26,733
You have assisted some camera man.

761
01:23:26,874 --> 01:23:29,934
Sir, l did it for survival.

762
01:23:30,411 --> 01:23:36,407
Well our movie is a love triangle,
a rich boy and a poor girl.

763
01:23:36,684 --> 01:23:38,549
Both of them love each other a lot,

764
01:23:38,619 --> 01:23:40,484
and get engaged.

765
01:23:41,889 --> 01:23:44,414
The girl throws an engagement
party for her friends,

766
01:23:45,693 --> 01:23:48,025
where our second hero enters story,

767
01:23:48,429 --> 01:23:50,897
He is very smart and handsome..

768
01:23:51,899 --> 01:23:55,630
And the girl falls
in love with him.

769
01:23:57,971 --> 01:24:01,429
You will play the character
of that handsome stranger.

770
01:24:03,510 --> 01:24:04,568
Nice, it's a great story.

771
01:24:05,446 --> 01:24:09,382
Bullshit, that's what happens
in 99% of the love stories.

772
01:24:14,521 --> 01:24:16,785
Sir, then what happens after that?

773
01:24:17,458 --> 01:24:18,652
Even l don't know that.

774
01:24:20,994 --> 01:24:23,121
Oh, so the story is
still being written.

775
01:24:23,397 --> 01:24:26,855
We are making the film
without the story.

776
01:24:29,470 --> 01:24:32,064
A love story, that
happens in reality.

777
01:24:32,139 --> 01:24:35,404
Reality cinema, real characters,
real love,

778
01:24:35,476 --> 01:24:38,468
real anger, real tears,
real passion.

779
01:24:39,012 --> 01:24:41,537
You know there are lots
of twists in reality.

780
01:24:42,416 --> 01:24:47,080
Did you know you would
be selected? No, right?

781
01:24:47,154 --> 01:24:48,416
That's reality.

782
01:24:49,556 --> 01:24:51,683
That means l have been selected.

783
01:24:51,759 --> 01:24:55,024
Yes, and you will film your
exciting story yourself

784
01:24:55,763 --> 01:24:57,162
with this video camera.

785
01:24:57,431 --> 01:24:59,956
Ronnie, give him the contract.

786
01:25:04,505 --> 01:25:06,166
You didn't hear the real twist.

787
01:25:07,508 --> 01:25:09,442
The girl and her fiance will
not know till the end,

788
01:25:09,510 --> 01:25:12,035
that a movie is being
made about them.

789
01:25:14,515 --> 01:25:17,109
You mean they are not actors.

790
01:25:18,519 --> 01:25:19,577
No.

791
01:25:22,055 --> 01:25:24,114
l will really have to ruin
their relationship.

792
01:25:24,525 --> 01:25:26,186
That's the USP of our film.

793
01:25:29,930 --> 01:25:32,865
No sir, l cannot do this.

794
01:25:36,603 --> 01:25:38,468
l can't play with someone's life.

795
01:25:38,539 --> 01:25:41,201
That's wrong.

796
01:25:41,475 --> 01:25:43,466
What's wrong about it? Thousands
of relationships

797
01:25:43,544 --> 01:25:44,670
are formed and break
up in this world.

798
01:25:44,745 --> 01:25:46,872
lf another one breaks up, what
difference will it make?

799
01:25:46,947 --> 01:25:48,471
Are you a supreme court judge

800
01:25:48,549 --> 01:25:50,073
to decide what is wrong and right?

801
01:25:50,617 --> 01:25:54,018
Look Vicky, you will get
1 million for this film.

802
01:25:54,087 --> 01:25:57,147
And you will have guaranteed stardom
after the movie's release.

803
01:25:57,491 --> 01:25:58,549
Be practical.

804
01:25:58,625 --> 01:26:02,493
People don't hesitate to
kill someone for money,

805
01:26:02,563 --> 01:26:05,225
..but you hesitate on account
of breaking a relationship?

806
01:26:07,501 --> 01:26:11,699
l won't be able to do this, sorry.

807
01:26:14,842 --> 01:26:16,833
l rejected his offer..

808
01:26:17,978 --> 01:26:20,242
..but l was helpless due
to my unemployment.

809
01:26:21,582 --> 01:26:25,245
l was under a lot of debts,
so l was forced to do this.

810
01:26:30,657 --> 01:26:35,720
l didn't have any other go other
than accepting Rohit's offer.

811
01:26:38,599 --> 01:26:39,657
Who is the girl?

812
01:26:40,601 --> 01:26:44,128
She lives in Dubai,
her name is Sophia.

813
01:26:47,207 --> 01:26:49,675
So, l came along with Rohit,
Siddharth and Ronnie to Dubai.

814
01:26:50,878 --> 01:26:53,540
That evening when you threw your
engagement party, the same evening..

815
01:26:53,614 --> 01:26:56,811
..Karan introduced me to the
hotel manager and the singer.

816
01:26:57,618 --> 01:27:01,281
He gave them money and told them the
plan for you to come closer to me.

817
01:27:08,095 --> 01:27:12,031
l am sorry Sophia, but that's truth.

818
01:27:14,167 --> 01:27:16,829
You used me to make your film.

819
01:27:17,771 --> 01:27:20,831
That means, whatever happened
between us was a lie?

820
01:27:21,708 --> 01:27:27,305
lt began with a lie but
l started liking you.

821
01:27:30,651 --> 01:27:33,848
That day when you came
to return the jacket,

822
01:27:35,722 --> 01:27:38,316
l realized how much l love you.

823
01:27:40,661 --> 01:27:41,787
Right then l told Rohit that..

824
01:27:41,929 --> 01:27:43,328
..l wouldn't be able
to do this assignment.

825
01:27:46,733 --> 01:27:49,327
l went to the Dubai festival
to arrange the money

826
01:27:50,671 --> 01:27:52,332
..to return to Mumbai.

827
01:28:17,698 --> 01:28:21,634
Mr. Rohit, do you know
Karan committed suicide

828
01:28:21,702 --> 01:28:24,762
..because of us?
- Really.

829
01:28:45,325 --> 01:28:49,921
Hi Sophia.
- Karan, you?

830
01:28:52,332 --> 01:28:55,267
Aren't you shocked to
see a dead man walking?

831
01:28:59,740 --> 01:29:03,733
Karan and Rohit..
- Yes, Both the names belong to me.

832
01:29:03,810 --> 01:29:06,677
Rohit for you, and Karan for Sophia.

833
01:29:08,815 --> 01:29:11,283
By the way, my real
name is Rohit Shroff.

834
01:29:14,688 --> 01:29:16,087
Don't be so shocked Sophia,

835
01:29:16,890 --> 01:29:20,758
l did not shoot myself;
l was just shooting for my film.

836
01:29:21,762 --> 01:29:25,698
'Karan loves you,
l will always love you.'

837
01:29:32,039 --> 01:29:33,904
Mind blowing!
- Good shot!

838
01:29:33,974 --> 01:29:36,238
Mind blowing!

839
01:29:36,309 --> 01:29:38,777
lt was mind blowing man,
clean this up.

840
01:29:39,179 --> 01:29:40,237
Brilliant.

841
01:29:43,784 --> 01:29:47,447
The ambulance, police officer.

842
01:29:48,855 --> 01:29:50,914
All of them were actors,
junior artists.

843
01:29:51,792 --> 01:29:55,728
l acted in the entire film, Mr.
Ronnie please tell him..

844
01:29:55,796 --> 01:29:58,924
..to pay me extra.
- Handle her. - Here.

845
01:29:58,999 --> 01:30:00,057
Thank you.

846
01:30:00,133 --> 01:30:01,191
Here and sign here.

847
01:30:01,268 --> 01:30:05,466
By the Siddharth and Ronnie helped
me a lot in making the film.

848
01:30:11,344 --> 01:30:13,471
'l wish you had hit me
here instead of there.'

849
01:30:15,082 --> 01:30:18,483
'Come on Sophia; don't create
a scene by crying here.'

850
01:30:31,164 --> 01:30:33,496
Posing as Karan you played
a game with us.

851
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:35,299
You deceived us!

852
01:30:37,971 --> 01:30:42,772
Deceived? When you slept
with my fiance,

853
01:30:42,843 --> 01:30:43,901
didn't you deceive me?

854
01:30:46,379 --> 01:30:47,778
lf Sophia's fiance was someone,

855
01:30:47,848 --> 01:30:52,046
other than me, would you have
made her your sister?

856
01:30:55,856 --> 01:30:57,847
You made a mockery of my emotions.

857
01:30:58,859 --> 01:31:00,326
You are mentally sick.

858
01:31:00,460 --> 01:31:03,258
Yes l am mentally sick, l
don't have any emotions!

859
01:31:05,866 --> 01:31:07,527
l don't know what emotions are.

860
01:31:08,935 --> 01:31:10,869
Throughout my childhood l didn't
get any love from my parents!

861
01:31:13,340 --> 01:31:15,001
My father was always
busy making money,

862
01:31:16,076 --> 01:31:20,069
and my mother, was always busy
with her kitty parties.

863
01:31:21,882 --> 01:31:24,407
Since l was a child, l had been
taught that money is everything!

864
01:31:26,153 --> 01:31:28,553
You can buy anyone's
life with money.

865
01:31:29,890 --> 01:31:31,881
You can buy anyone's emotions.

866
01:31:36,830 --> 01:31:37,888
You wanted to hear that, right?

867
01:31:40,901 --> 01:31:42,562
The audience will also
like to hear that.

868
01:31:45,906 --> 01:31:48,238
Actually my mother and
father gave me a lot of love.

869
01:31:48,975 --> 01:31:51,842
They motivated me to
do something different.

870
01:31:52,979 --> 01:31:56,915
l am not mentally sick,
l have a lot of confidence.

871
01:31:58,518 --> 01:32:02,113
Anyways, today because of you,
l got another good scene.

872
01:32:03,390 --> 01:32:04,982
You know, these emotional scenes

873
01:32:05,058 --> 01:32:06,389
..work beautifully in the climax.

874
01:32:12,933 --> 01:32:14,059
lf l hadn't installed
this camera here,

875
01:32:17,470 --> 01:32:21,600
how would l have got
those romantic scenes

876
01:32:22,542 --> 01:32:25,272
..for my film, especially
that love making scene?

877
01:32:25,946 --> 01:32:27,937
There will be repeat audience
especially for that scene.

878
01:32:31,484 --> 01:32:34,476
l swear l didn't know anything
about that camera.

879
01:32:35,889 --> 01:32:37,356
Sophia you have to believe me.

880
01:32:37,424 --> 01:32:38,482
He gave me this house.

881
01:32:38,558 --> 01:32:41,493
He is right; he doesn't know
anything about this camera.

882
01:32:42,295 --> 01:32:44,559
He doesn't even know,
that the camera is here..

883
01:32:44,898 --> 01:32:46,365
..the recording was made in
the van parked near this house.

884
01:32:52,973 --> 01:32:57,967
lf he knew, your love making
wouldn't have been so realistic.

885
01:32:58,245 --> 01:33:00,975
Your expressions wouldn't
have been so natural.

886
01:33:03,049 --> 01:33:04,914
Come, l will show you.

887
01:33:43,290 --> 01:33:45,019
There is so much
passion in your kiss.

888
01:33:45,558 --> 01:33:47,219
They say if your
love is genuine,

889
01:33:47,427 --> 01:33:49,486
..your eyes close
when you kiss.

890
01:33:56,436 --> 01:34:00,429
Have you ever kissed me
with so much passion?

891
01:34:01,308 --> 01:34:04,175
No.

892
01:34:05,245 --> 01:34:07,509
You didn't, because
you never loved me.

893
01:34:09,115 --> 01:34:12,380
Even before Vicky
came into the story.

894
01:34:14,054 --> 01:34:16,386
There it was just sympathy,

895
01:34:17,991 --> 01:34:20,585
..understanding, and a lot
of money between us.

896
01:34:22,062 --> 01:34:25,657
You just pretended to love me
for your future security.

897
01:34:32,672 --> 01:34:34,071
Another excellent shot.

898
01:34:36,009 --> 01:34:38,068
l can't believe this,
without glycerin.

899
01:34:39,079 --> 01:34:41,741
Damn it, l am a spontaneous actor.

900
01:34:45,085 --> 01:34:46,211
Second camera.

901
01:34:49,089 --> 01:34:51,080
And here is the last camera.

902
01:34:54,160 --> 01:34:55,752
You cannot release this picture.

903
01:34:56,563 --> 01:34:58,428
You don't have Sophia's
consent letter.

904
01:35:03,236 --> 01:35:07,570
l planned every minor detail,
how did l forget this?

905
01:35:10,110 --> 01:35:11,236
Can that be possible?

906
01:35:13,246 --> 01:35:16,238
Not just the consent letter,
she has signed the contract.

907
01:35:16,716 --> 01:35:20,516
l took her signature telling her
it was our marriage application.

908
01:35:26,126 --> 01:35:27,184
Here.

909
01:35:32,132 --> 01:35:34,726
'You must be exhausted,
go and rest.'

910
01:35:48,214 --> 01:35:50,148
l have done everything
with perfect planning.

911
01:35:50,216 --> 01:35:53,481
You were afraid that your
boyfriend was following you..

912
01:35:54,287 --> 01:35:57,552
..but that was my
hired detective.

913
01:35:59,159 --> 01:36:01,093
Even the detective
didn't realize

914
01:36:01,161 --> 01:36:04,756
..he was shooting my film
by keeping a watch on you.

915
01:36:06,166 --> 01:36:08,100
You know, it
was very important

916
01:36:08,168 --> 01:36:11,160
for you affair to
continue in my film,

917
01:36:12,172 --> 01:36:15,164
so that my character gets an
emotional advantage in the film.

918
01:36:16,242 --> 01:36:18,107
But when Vicky called
me up and said

919
01:36:18,178 --> 01:36:21,841
that he would not do complete the
job, then l had to change my plan.

920
01:36:22,782 --> 01:36:25,114
l took you to the Dubai festival,
so that you could meet him again.

921
01:36:26,186 --> 01:36:30,122
Then when l realized that
you broke off with Vicky

922
01:36:30,190 --> 01:36:33,125
to marry me, l sent
Siddharth and Ronnie,

923
01:36:33,193 --> 01:36:35,855
..to tell you about
Vicky's sacrifice.

924
01:36:36,796 --> 01:36:38,457
You finally left me for Vicky..

925
01:36:38,531 --> 01:36:42,467
..then came my turn
to make a sacrifice.

926
01:36:43,203 --> 01:36:44,261
Bang.

927
01:36:45,672 --> 01:36:46,798
lt is so emotional.

928
01:36:48,208 --> 01:36:49,266
Amazing.

929
01:36:50,810 --> 01:36:55,144
Don't be so depressed, both
of your performances

930
01:36:55,215 --> 01:36:56,807
..were very good
throughout the film.

931
01:36:57,484 --> 01:36:59,543
One day you will thank me.

932
01:36:59,752 --> 01:37:04,212
Now just see how
l will promote my film.

933
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:10,558
l will not let you release
this film, come what may.

934
01:37:11,364 --> 01:37:15,425
Don't even think about it,
lt's my last warning.

935
01:37:16,302 --> 01:37:20,898
lf you try to interfere with
the release of my film,

936
01:37:21,774 --> 01:37:26,575
l will upload your love making
scene onto the internet.

937
01:37:29,315 --> 01:37:32,182
After that, and instead
of becoming movie stars,

938
01:37:32,252 --> 01:37:33,913
you will become porn stars.

939
01:37:37,323 --> 01:37:41,453
Remember my words - you guys
are going to be big stars.

940
01:38:39,319 --> 01:38:40,718
So congratulations, Mr. Rohit.

941
01:38:40,787 --> 01:38:44,245
A film winning the best film
award in all the festivals,

942
01:38:44,324 --> 01:38:45,723
that has never happened before.

943
01:38:45,792 --> 01:38:47,259
lt is the first time.

944
01:38:48,261 --> 01:38:51,321
l didn't expect that it would
be appreciated so much.

945
01:38:51,397 --> 01:38:54,264
Ms. Sophia wasn't aware
that she was in the film,

946
01:38:54,334 --> 01:38:55,733
during the shooting.

947
01:38:55,802 --> 01:38:58,600
Yeah or how could you have
called it reality cinema?

948
01:39:00,406 --> 01:39:04,274
But without telling her,
you made her a character

949
01:39:04,344 --> 01:39:06,471
of your film. She must
have been angry.

950
01:39:06,946 --> 01:39:10,006
Sophia will give you
the answer to that.

951
01:39:12,352 --> 01:39:15,287
To tell you the truth, at
first l felt very bad,

952
01:39:15,355 --> 01:39:18,290
but after the film festival awards..

953
01:39:18,358 --> 01:39:21,293
and watching the movie, l realised

954
01:39:21,361 --> 01:39:25,354
that there is no one
as creative as Rohit.

955
01:39:26,366 --> 01:39:28,300
lf Rohit hadn't come into my life,

956
01:39:28,368 --> 01:39:29,960
it would have been so aimless.

957
01:39:30,036 --> 01:39:32,300
Today there is a
purpose to my life,

958
01:39:32,372 --> 01:39:33,498
a feeling to do something.

959
01:39:36,442 --> 01:39:37,966
He gave a new direction
to my life.

960
01:39:40,380 --> 01:39:43,315
By the way you are always
seen together,

961
01:39:43,383 --> 01:39:44,441
at pubs, discs, parties,
everywhere.

962
01:39:44,517 --> 01:39:45,643
But if we were to ask you,

963
01:39:45,718 --> 01:39:47,777
..you would say that you are
just good friends, right?

964
01:39:47,987 --> 01:39:52,583
No l won't, because Rohit is not
my friend, he is my fiance.

965
01:39:52,725 --> 01:39:55,387
Wow, then double congratulations.

966
01:39:55,461 --> 01:39:56,928
Just one last question.

967
01:39:57,063 --> 01:40:00,055
When will we be able to see
this film in lndian theatres?

968
01:40:00,667 --> 01:40:02,532
Just let the Goa film festival end,

969
01:40:02,602 --> 01:40:05,867
then we will release it worldwide.

970
01:40:06,406 --> 01:40:08,340
Well all the best for your release

971
01:40:08,408 --> 01:40:09,739
at the Goa film festival.

972
01:40:09,809 --> 01:40:11,071
Thank you Rohit, thank you Sophia.

973
01:40:12,011 --> 01:40:14,070
Till next time then, this
is Archana Puransingh

974
01:40:14,347 --> 01:40:15,405
saying goodbye.

975
01:40:45,445 --> 01:40:48,039
Yes, we are the producers
of this film.

976
01:40:48,114 --> 01:40:50,708
Your film has been nominated
for today's award,

977
01:40:50,783 --> 01:40:51,841
how do you feel?

978
01:40:51,918 --> 01:40:54,910
We know for sure that we are
going to win this award.

979
01:40:54,987 --> 01:40:57,387
We have worked very hard
to make this movie.

980
01:40:57,457 --> 01:40:59,391
But we have heard that
Mr. Rohit Shroff

981
01:40:59,459 --> 01:41:01,051
made the biggest creative
contribution..

982
01:41:01,127 --> 01:41:02,458
..towards making this film.

983
01:41:02,528 --> 01:41:05,122
Rohit just financed the film.

984
01:41:05,398 --> 01:41:09,061
Look, the basic idea of making
this film was mine.

985
01:41:09,402 --> 01:41:13,736
l mean ours. We asked Rohit
to make this movie.

986
01:41:13,873 --> 01:41:17,400
He just improvised on it.

987
01:41:17,477 --> 01:41:19,536
And anyone can do that.

988
01:41:19,612 --> 01:41:23,139
Look, the basic idea of making
this film was ours.

989
01:41:23,483 --> 01:41:25,474
But how did you get this idea?

990
01:41:27,086 --> 01:41:30,419
One day we were coming
out of the bathroom..

991
01:41:30,490 --> 01:41:32,151
No, no you have forgotten it.

992
01:41:32,425 --> 01:41:34,484
We were sitting inside the bathroom.

993
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:36,027
And we were sitting
in the bathroom, when

994
01:41:36,095 --> 01:41:37,153
we suddenly had this idea.

995
01:41:37,430 --> 01:41:40,490
You know, the best ideas are
thought of in the bathroom.

996
01:41:42,635 --> 01:41:43,761
The artists are here.

997
01:41:43,836 --> 01:41:44,894
That idea..

998
01:41:52,779 --> 01:41:54,974
Mr. Rohit.. - Mr. Rohit.

999
01:41:55,047 --> 01:41:57,447
Please sir. - Please tell us
something about the film.

1000
01:41:57,517 --> 01:41:58,575
Please sir.

1001
01:41:58,651 --> 01:41:59,709
Please sir!

1002
01:41:59,786 --> 01:42:01,185
Relax, calm down.

1003
01:42:01,454 --> 01:42:04,116
l have arranged a press conference
after the awards function.

1004
01:42:04,190 --> 01:42:06,181
l will answer all your
questions there.

1005
01:42:12,465 --> 01:42:15,593
And now to present the award
for the best film,

1006
01:42:15,735 --> 01:42:18,932
l am pleased to invite
a creative genius,

1007
01:42:19,005 --> 01:42:22,463
who won the best directors
award in the same

1008
01:42:22,542 --> 01:42:24,874
prestigious film festival last year.

1009
01:42:25,611 --> 01:42:30,139
l call upon Mr. Simon Mark.

1010
01:42:33,953 --> 01:42:35,011
Thank you.

1011
01:42:36,022 --> 01:42:38,490
Thank you, it is a great pleasure

1012
01:42:38,558 --> 01:42:41,493
to be here for the
37th lnternational

1013
01:42:41,561 --> 01:42:42,960
Film Festival of lndia.

1014
01:42:43,029 --> 01:42:45,497
And now it's a great honour,
to announce the winner

1015
01:42:45,565 --> 01:42:47,692
in this years best film category.

1016
01:42:56,576 --> 01:42:59,704
And the award goes to Rohit Shroff.

1017
01:43:11,524 --> 01:43:13,651
What are you doing, couldn't
you load it earlier?

1018
01:43:13,726 --> 01:43:15,250
l have already loaded it,
l am just checking.

1019
01:43:24,604 --> 01:43:25,866
Why are you sitting? Come on.

1020
01:43:31,611 --> 01:43:33,272
Shoot it quickly or else
you will miss the award.

1021
01:43:33,613 --> 01:43:35,740
Relax, l am not a professional.

1022
01:44:10,182 --> 01:44:12,309
Rohit! Rohit! Rohit! Rohit!

1023
01:44:12,652 --> 01:44:15,587
Help! Call the doctor!

1024
01:44:15,655 --> 01:44:17,054
Call the ambulance!

1025
01:44:28,734 --> 01:44:30,668
So you fired from this gun.

1026
01:44:31,637 --> 01:44:32,729
Yes.

1027
01:44:34,674 --> 01:44:37,666
But sir, there were blanks in it.

1028
01:44:37,810 --> 01:44:40,005
l know there were blanks in it.

1029
01:44:41,747 --> 01:44:43,681
Then who shot Rohit with
the real bullets?

1030
01:44:56,696 --> 01:44:59,358
Tell me, why you fired
the blanks at Rohit.

1031
01:45:00,700 --> 01:45:02,759
Sir, because Ronnie and
Siddharth asked me to.

1032
01:45:02,835 --> 01:45:04,234
They gave me this gun too.

1033
01:45:05,705 --> 01:45:07,172
Who are Ronnie and Siddharth?

1034
01:45:07,707 --> 01:45:09,299
Sir, they are the producers
of the film.

1035
01:45:10,176 --> 01:45:11,370
All of this was their idea.

1036
01:45:11,644 --> 01:45:12,702
'The media from all over
the world will be present

1037
01:45:12,778 --> 01:45:13,836
at the awards function.'

1038
01:45:13,913 --> 01:45:16,040
'As soon as Rohit goes on
stage to collect his award,

1039
01:45:16,115 --> 01:45:18,106
take your dummy gun
out and shoot him.'

1040
01:45:18,184 --> 01:45:19,242
'He will fall down.'

1041
01:45:19,318 --> 01:45:22,378
'People will think that you killed
Rohit for revenge.'

1042
01:45:22,655 --> 01:45:23,781
'There will be chaos
in the entire hall.'

1043
01:45:23,856 --> 01:45:27,383
'But then Rohit will stand up and
say that it was just a stunt.'

1044
01:45:28,661 --> 01:45:29,719
'Rohit knows all this.'

1045
01:45:29,795 --> 01:45:32,059
'You don't worry, Rohit
knows everything.'

1046
01:45:32,732 --> 01:45:35,132
The film was about to
be released in 15 days,

1047
01:45:35,201 --> 01:45:38,728
and this was just
a publicity stunt.

1048
01:45:40,673 --> 01:45:42,402
lf you want you can ask them.

1049
01:45:48,948 --> 01:45:50,006
Does this camera belong to you?

1050
01:45:50,750 --> 01:45:52,217
Yes, this camera belongs to us.

1051
01:45:59,759 --> 01:46:00,817
This gun belongs to you too?

1052
01:46:02,361 --> 01:46:04,158
No, this gun does not belong to us.

1053
01:46:04,764 --> 01:46:06,891
Sir, we have never seen
a real gun in our life.

1054
01:46:08,768 --> 01:46:10,167
The gun that you never saw,

1055
01:46:10,236 --> 01:46:11,965
how does it have you
finger prints on it.

1056
01:46:14,373 --> 01:46:15,704
According to the forensic report,

1057
01:46:15,775 --> 01:46:17,709
the bullet that hit
Rohit and the bullet

1058
01:46:17,777 --> 01:46:19,768
that was fired from this
gun, is the same.

1059
01:46:21,781 --> 01:46:22,839
What?

1060
01:47:05,825 --> 01:47:08,953
lnstead of harassing us, why
don't you ask Vicky? - Yes.

1061
01:47:21,841 --> 01:47:24,503
So far you were convicted
for an attempt to murder,

1062
01:47:25,911 --> 01:47:29,176
but now you are convicted under
section 302, murder.

1063
01:47:31,851 --> 01:47:32,909
Rohit has died.

1064
01:47:33,986 --> 01:47:35,044
What?

1065
01:47:38,390 --> 01:47:41,188
Sir, please believe us.
We are innocent.

1066
01:47:41,861 --> 01:47:43,522
Sir, look we are
no ordinary people.

1067
01:47:43,796 --> 01:47:46,788
Someone is trying to trap us,
Do you have any proof?.

1068
01:47:49,802 --> 01:47:50,860
Proof.

1069
01:48:08,888 --> 01:48:10,947
What are you doing, couldn't
you load it earlier?

1070
01:48:11,023 --> 01:48:12,820
l have already loaded it,
l am just checking.

1071
01:48:15,895 --> 01:48:17,487
Shoot it quickly or else
you will miss the award.

1072
01:48:17,563 --> 01:48:19,895
Relax, l am not a professional.

1073
01:48:37,917 --> 01:48:38,975
Can you see that ring?

1074
01:48:49,395 --> 01:48:50,862
That ring is yours,
that hand is yours,

1075
01:48:50,930 --> 01:48:52,591
the camera is yours too.

1076
01:48:52,865 --> 01:48:54,594
Then how can the gun
be someone else's?

1077
01:48:55,534 --> 01:48:57,058
You gave a gun loaded
with blanks to Vicky,

1078
01:48:57,269 --> 01:48:59,464
..and used the other
gun with a silencer.

1079
01:49:01,207 --> 01:49:02,606
l know what you have done.

1080
01:49:03,943 --> 01:49:05,342
Why didn't you tell me?

1081
01:49:05,411 --> 01:49:06,469
Why didn't you tell me?

1082
01:49:06,545 --> 01:49:08,410
Believe me, l did not do anything!

1083
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:09,538
Shut up!

1084
01:49:10,950 --> 01:49:12,611
You are under arrest, understood.

1085
01:49:12,952 --> 01:49:14,943
Sir, listen to us..
- Mhatre!

1086
01:49:15,888 --> 01:49:17,355
Look sir..
- Take them away.

1087
01:49:17,423 --> 01:49:18,617
Please listen to us sir.

1088
01:49:19,425 --> 01:49:21,359
Sir, sir.

1089
01:50:02,935 --> 01:50:03,993
He is dead.

1090
01:50:09,408 --> 01:50:10,466
l know.

1091
01:50:18,083 --> 01:50:19,607
Why are you seated? Come on.

1092
01:51:16,342 --> 01:51:18,469
312, here is the paper.

1093
01:51:21,146 --> 01:51:23,273
Open it, open it, open it!

1094
01:51:26,752 --> 01:51:29,016
Our film 'Naqab' is going
to be premiered,

1095
01:51:29,088 --> 01:51:30,749
and the advanced booking is full.

1096
01:51:31,090 --> 01:51:35,026
lt is all your fault, if
you hadn't shot Karan,

1097
01:51:35,094 --> 01:51:36,288
we would have been at the premiere.

1098
01:51:37,096 --> 01:51:38,495
How many times do
l have to tell you?

1099
01:51:38,564 --> 01:51:41,032
.l did not shoot Karan,
l did not shoot Karan,

1100
01:51:41,100 --> 01:51:42,294
l did not shoot him!

1101
01:51:42,368 --> 01:51:43,494
Do you want to kill me now?

1102
01:52:29,148 --> 01:52:30,274
Hey, where do you want to see?

1103
01:52:31,083 --> 01:52:33,483
A deal is a deal, good night.

1104
01:52:33,552 --> 01:52:37,613
Cut.
- What about the money?

1105
01:52:37,689 --> 01:52:40,817
For my grandchildren
- cut.

1106
01:52:46,698 --> 01:52:49,758
You know.. - Cut, again you
are going ahead of me.

1107
01:52:58,777 --> 01:53:00,108
You don't trust me.

1108
01:53:03,449 --> 01:53:05,314
Oh god. - What oh God? -
l forgot the dialogue.

1109
01:53:08,120 --> 01:53:09,178
He has fallen down.

1110
01:53:15,594 --> 01:53:16,720
l will always love you.
