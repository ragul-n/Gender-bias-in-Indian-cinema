1
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:25,840
According to Vedas,
"Sound is supreme.

2
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,120
Till date...

3
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,840
I really never understood
what it means.

4
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:39,319
But now I realise
the wisdom of these words.

5
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:45,959
Sound cannot be seen or touched...

6
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:47,439
...or felt.

7
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:51,359
Yet everything that
we see or feel around us...

8
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:58,560
...we express to others
through sound.

9
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:00,400
I believe...

10
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,319
I believe that the right
combination of sounds...

11
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,840
can have an everlasting impact...

12
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:17,599
...on the human body and mind."

13
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,080
These are the words of the
ancient scientist Aghor Sen.

14
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,719
His main area of research was sound.

15
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,080
He invented an amazing machine
150 years ago.

16
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,400
I'm here today to tell you
about that machine.

17
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,319
Aghor writes....

18
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,159
"Today, I am convinced.

19
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,080
That my machine can put
any living being to sleep...

20
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,280
with the help of
some primitive sounds."

21
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:11,879
No sleeping pills.

22
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:19,360
Only some special sounds can put
a man to sleep for several years.

23
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:21,840
And he found proof.

24
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:25,159
Excuse me, Professor Nandy.

25
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:33,319
If someone wakes up after 150 years,
would he be that many years older?

26
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,319
Certainly, in terms of time.

27
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:40,520
But not in terms of his
mind and body.

28
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,280
-Excuse me.
-Do you want to ask anything?

29
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,639
Yes.

30
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,360
Is this a kind of
ultrasonic frequency?

31
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,879
Could you tell us how it works?

32
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:53,360
That is yet to be known.

33
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,280
The diary has some clues.

34
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:58,039
But that's not enough.

35
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,000
Moreover, the land of sleep
is not known to us.

36
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:04,520
Maybe the device can give us a hint.

37
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:11,719
No, I don't have the device yet.

38
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,959
According to the diary,
it is in Nischintipur.

39
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,319
In Aghor Sen's underground laboratory.

40
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,240
Hopefully it still works.

41
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:36,240
But how you are so sure
that the device is still there?

42
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:40,120
For now, I can only rely on his diary.

43
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:55,279
I'm hoping to get the device soon.

44
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:58,040
Then we'll get to know how it works.

45
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,879
Mr. Bhootnath, from its deisgn
or description--

46
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,000
Thanks.

47
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:14,319
It seems that the device
could be used as an weapon.

48
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,360
What are your thoughts on this?

49
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:27,240
You're saying it could be misused?

50
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,920
Does the responsibility of a gadget
rest on the inventor alone?

51
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,680
Or on the user too?

52
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,199
Yes, I agree.

53
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,040
But one still remains accountable, right?

54
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:45,800
The fear of misuse can't
stop the scientific research.

55
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,399
And frankly speaking...

56
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,360
I believe atomic energy is a boon,
not a bomb.

57
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:15,360
THE UNDERGROUND CHAMBER

58
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:41,160
Greetings.

59
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:04,279
How strange...

60
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,839
Quite unusual.

61
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:48,560
Bizarre!

62
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:51,720
You fraud!

63
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:54,160
It's a pencil bomb.

64
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:55,920
You baboon!

65
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,240
For the past six years you
drained out a million...

66
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:59,639
just to show me
this stupid sparkler?

67
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,120
-Six years?
-Sparklers?

68
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,560
Shut up!
How dare you talk back, jerk?

69
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,839
Madam, please spare me.

70
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:10,000
-Forgive me, ma'am...
-This will just not do.

71
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,959
Yes, ma'am.

72
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,480
At this rate, we'll end up
peddling gums and not guns.

73
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:14,480
Yes, ma'am.

74
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:18,319
-I need a master weapon.
-Yes, ma'am.

75
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,360
One that doesn't needed
too many to operate.

76
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,279
Yes, ma'am.

77
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:23,399
-One that's hassle-free to make.
-Yes, ma'am.

78
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:25,879
-No heavy expenses.
Yes, ma'am.

79
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,480
Gear it up to conquer
countries and continents.

80
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,480
Yes, ma'am.

81
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:33,159
Check and checkmate.

82
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,919
-Checkmate! Checkmate!
-Checkmate! Checkmate!

83
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:43,679
All kinds of criminals
will fall at my feet.

84
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,600
Yes, ma'am.

85
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:49,720
-"Begum, we want to buy your weapons"
-Yes, ma'am.

86
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,879
General Tekka wishes
to meet the Begum.

87
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:55,159
-Ask him to come in.
-Let him in.

88
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,879
(indistinct chatter)

89
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,080
-Wrestling with yourself?
-Are you?

90
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,159
No, ma'am.

91
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,519
Found it.

92
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,159
Don't waste my time
with useless weapons.

93
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,559
It's not a weapon.
I have some news.

94
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:34,000
That's all you have
after so many days?

95
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,799
You rheumatic ram!

96
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:39,279
"Today, I am convinced.

97
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:44,159
That my machine can put
any living being to sleep...

98
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,240
...with the help of
some primitive sounds."

99
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,720
No sleeping pills.

100
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:59,320
Only some special sounds can put
a man to sleep for several years.

101
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,120
And he had found proof.

102
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,720
(radio playing)

103
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,440
(news on radio)

104
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,240
My goodness!

105
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,360
Stop it!

106
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,519
Can't you just play the song?

107
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,039
Switching to nonsense channels.

108
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:13,279
What are you doing?

109
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,559
Bishu needs it back at his shop
by four p.m.

110
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,879
-Why?
-India is playing today.

111
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:19,120
Match my foot...

112
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,200
He will pay 150 bucks.

113
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,960
You're my little genius!

114
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,720
I knew it.

115
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:33,480
My horoscope predicted
monetary gain thanks to love ones.

116
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,200
-Who the hell left the door wide open?
-What happened?

117
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:41,039
If I get robbed,
I'll have you all arrested!

118
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:45,840
The cops will put you behind the bars!

119
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:48,679
Damn tenants!

120
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,000
Hey! Who are you?

121
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:52,840
-What do you want ?
-Where does Kartik Bose live?

122
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,480
Right here on my head!
Disgusting!

123
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,039
Banerjee starts bickering
early in the morning. How annoying!

124
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,440
(indistinct chatter)

125
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:05,159
Where does Kartik Bose live?

126
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,399
Second floor, second room..

127
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:10,879
What a heartless man.

128
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:15,720
What's the big deal if
we stay in this small room?

129
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:18,200
You said we haven't paid rent
for 10 months.

130
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:19,759
Keep quiet.

131
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:26,559
You can't do anything properly!

132
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,240
As if it's my fault.

133
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:33,799
That lottery ticket could have
cleared our dues and more.

134
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,799
I told you to bring ticket number 45444.

135
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:38,759
But you brought 45449! Worthless!

136
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,759
-Who's that?
-I'm sure that's Banerjee.

137
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,879
Exactly as I feared.

138
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:49,120
-Tell him that I'm asleep.
-Liar.

139
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:50,960
-You always lie after taking loans...
-What the hell?

140
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,480
Donâ€™t open the door if
it's the moneylender.

141
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:55,279
What a frightful guy.

142
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:57,480
Someone's scratching his leg...

143
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:00,440
-It's not the moneylender.
-Then who? Any scar on the face?

144
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:02,000
No.

145
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,440
Then Nani Aunty must have
come for her money.

146
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:06,200
Hey! Don't open the door!

147
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,519
Who is it?

148
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:11,120
Does Kartik Bose lives here?

149
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:13,200
-That's me.
-Who is it?

150
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,919
Good Lord! Finally!

151
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,840
What a chaotic place.

152
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,120
Who are you?

153
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,519
I am Gangacharan Sapui, BA LLB.

154
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:24,240
From Sapui and Sapui...
Sapui and Sapui solicitors.

155
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,360
Are you a snake charmer?

156
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,840
No, I mean...
Is there a snake or something in your bag?

157
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:30,960
-Father's name is Bholanath Bose.
-Yes.

158
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,039
Mother's name, Gauri Bose.

159
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:33,360
Cousin sister Lakshmi Bose.

160
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:35,360
Cousin brother Ganesh Bose.

161
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,240
And the backyard buffalo is
"Mahisasur" Bose.

162
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,759
No, I was just kidding.

163
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:42,679
-Keto, give him some water! He's coughing!
-Yeah, yeah.

164
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:44,679
Granny wants the money
for buttermilk.

165
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,159
Give this to her.

166
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,559
Found it! Found it!

167
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:55,799
Hold the papers of your house.
Take a look of the documents.

168
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:57,440
Don't worry, this will help you.

169
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,399
So, what do you do?

170
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:02,879
I repair TV sets and radios.

171
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,240
A mechanic?

172
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:06,039
(radio playing)

173
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,759
But Mr. Snake Charmer--
I mean, Sapui.

174
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:11,879
What's this about?

175
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,960
You will get to know everything.

176
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,240
How are you related to
Horolal Mitra of Nischintipur?

177
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,600
My uncle.
But I have never seen him...

178
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,720
You have seen him but don't remember.
But no matter.

179
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:27,600
Your uncle left his will with us
before he died.

180
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,480
You mean Sapui and Sapui,
Sapui and Sapui ....

181
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:31,600
Uncle, please stop.

182
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:34,919
His instructions were to give
his property to his real heir.

183
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,840
He died without a child,
so what to do?

184
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:40,879
I can't just hire one.

185
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:45,519
After a crazy search,
I found you.

186
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,960
Me?

187
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:50,399
The whole house now belongs to Keto?

188
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,559
Sir, please have some milk.
Here's some hot milk.

189
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:59,120
Horolal died leaving
the will with us.

190
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:02,600
There was no rush...

191
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,039
That's right.

192
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,879
Recently, some random people
have came to Nischintipur...

193
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,919
and started buying the
old houses for millions.

194
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:13,720
Oh, millions.
What! Millions?

195
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,639
They came to buy yours as well.

196
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:19,960
-Oh!
-This is the chance of a lifetime.

197
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:24,279
Sell yours too.
Don't worry, I'll guide you.

198
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:25,320
Okay.

199
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,840
But why are they
buying old houses?

200
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:29,399
Looking for ghosts.

201
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,519
Ghosts!

202
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:34,200
The whims of the rich.

203
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:35,840
Researching on ghosts.

204
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:38,519
Haunted house are being sold
at a high price.

205
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:41,840
-Hey! Think you're real smart, huh?
-Oh, that's nothing.

206
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,399
The scoundrels are ruining
our house, Haren.

207
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:51,559
I asked for my money
and they sent me legal notices!

208
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:55,960
-Then shall we finalise the deal?
-Finalise...

209
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,279
-Let's go to Nischintipur for a few days...
-Say no!

210
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:04,799
You can have their famous sweets
and return with lots of money.

211
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,159
Let's get there and then we can...

212
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:10,039
Oh!
So no deal now?

213
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,759
-No.
-Oh!

214
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:16,440
(radio playing)

215
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:23,279
Bye then.

216
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:26,240
(radio playing)

217
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:28,279
(indistinct chatter)

218
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
(humming)

219
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,240
(singing)

220
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:10,440
"Humpty-Dumpty sat on a wall."

221
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Welcome, Mr.Bhootnath.

222
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:15,480
Welcome.

223
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:19,440
Who are you?

224
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:23,079
We have some...

225
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,720
business with you.

226
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,079
Who are you?

227
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,000
Do you ever heard of the Begum?

228
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:37,000
What do you want?

229
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:40,599
A bit of help, sir.

230
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,599
Come to the point.

231
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,319
We want the weapon.

232
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,960
-What weapon?
-Oh really?

233
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:52,400
The one you mentioned
in the seminar.

234
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,759
The sleep machine.

235
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,480
I even don't know where it is.

236
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,759
Very well.

237
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,079
Let's look for it.

238
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,400
Together.

239
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,599
How could you expect that?

240
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,319
Duggi.

241
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:24,640
Take a look.

242
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:28,480
Just a second.

243
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,519
How dare you?

244
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:40,079
(indistinct yelling)

245
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,920
-Nehla!
-Yes, boss?

246
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,440
Tell him.

247
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,039
That his friend used his formula
to make an...

248
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:00,279
-Earthquake bomb.
-...for us.

249
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:01,799
Does he get that?

250
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:05,880
Got it, Professor?

251
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:21,880
Salil Dutta?

252
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:29,359
Salil fled from the laboratory a year ago.

253
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:31,839
But I never thought he
took these documents....

254
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,599
You've been working with us
for a year now.

255
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:39,960
At least, that's what the documents say.

256
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,160
You are designing
illegal weapons for us.

257
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:50,799
If this information gets leaked,
your carrier will get ruined.

258
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:55,599
Wait for further instructions.

259
00:19:56,359 --> 00:20:02,319
If you inform the police,
your photo will out in the papers and...

260
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,160
Game over.

261
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:12,519
Hey! Golam!

262
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,400
Nischintipur, 3rd August, 1858.

263
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,319
Some strange things happened
in the last few days.

264
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:06,400
So I didn't get time to make dairy entries.

265
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,960
Today it's time to write them down.

266
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,160
My aunt's prayer room
was infested with mice.

267
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:16,880
Aunt didnâ€™t want them killed
as mice are Lord Ganesha's mascot.

268
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:21,599
So I tried to sedate them and...

269
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:25,079
I think I've invented
an extraordinary machine.

270
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:31,440
Last Tuesday, Chang aimed
my gadget at a crow.

271
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,880
And it immediately put the crow to sleep.

272
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:40,319
Yesterday, after a week's slumber,
he awoke and was cawing away as usual.

273
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:42,160
Today, I am convinced.

274
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:47,640
That my machine can put any living being
to sleep for a long time...

275
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,599
...with the help of
some primitive sounds.

276
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:57,440
Next, I'll try it on my cat
with a higher frequency.....

277
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,640
...and observe how long he sleeps for.

278
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,839
For last few days,
Waikiki been pretty restless.

279
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:07,400
He has heard strange sounds on
my wireless set in the underground chamber.

280
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:11,000
He believes the sounds are
from another planet.

281
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,839
I can't overrule his exceptional
Native American auditory instincts.

282
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,319
My Chinese assistant however,
isn't bothered at all.

283
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:25,200
Chang loves machines.

284
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:32,400
F-sharp...

285
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,240
F-sharp...

286
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,119
They will be the end of me!

287
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:45,359
Rats are eating
the bottle gourd in the garden.

288
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:49,359
Are you waiting for them
to eat us too?

289
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:52,039
Just wait and watch, Aunty.

290
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:56,160
They'll all go into hibernation.

291
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,079
Huh! As if!

292
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,480
You are struggling with machines
to put few rats to sleep.

293
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:08,400
If I'd asked the witch-doctor instead,
he would have done it in seconds.

294
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,359
-Here, your master weapon.
-Don't give me all that.

295
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,079
I asked you so many times
to get married.

296
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:19,559
To settle down.

297
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:23,200
But you got hold of a couple of jokers!

298
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,759
Huh! That's supposed to be a greeting?

299
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:31,759
(vocalising)

300
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,240
Spends all day with these
bottles and machines...

301
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:37,799
-F-sharp...
-I'm so fed up.

302
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:39,559
What do you keep doing all day--

303
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,319
Please sing. I'll play.

304
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:44,799
You're always busy doing nonsense
in this underground chamber.

305
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,119
-Be careful...
-Oh my!

306
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,480
My gout is killing me...

307
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:51,519
(vocalising)

308
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:59,079
You stay here with your machines.
I'm going to Kashi.

309
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:10,519
Why do you get angry Aunty
When the machines start dancing?

310
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,559
Every machine runs
On the power of science

311
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,839
Miracles happen

312
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,920
Miracles!
Miracles!

313
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,720
In our underground chamber

314
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,799
The machines are dancing

315
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:30,799
The force of water
Spins the fan

316
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,680
The force of water
Spins the fan

317
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,680
The wheel runs
To keep the room lit

318
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,759
Flip and flap

319
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:41,400
Oh the wheel

320
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:46,079
The force of water
Spins the fan

321
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:48,240
The wheel runs
To keep the room lit

322
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:51,960
Science is showing
Its wonders everywhere

323
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:54,400
Miracles happen

324
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,519
Miracles!
Miracles!

325
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,319
In our underground chamber

326
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,240
The machines are dancing

327
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,000
Colourful water, books and jars

328
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,240
The math of the moon and stars

329
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,279
Colourful water, books and jars

330
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:15,440
The math of the moon and stars

331
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,920
My sleeping gadget
Is a miracle of science

332
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,720
-A miracle of science
-A miracle of science

333
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,759
Miracles happen

334
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:25,880
Miracles!
Miracles!

335
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,720
In our underground chamber

336
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:34,319
Why do you get angry Aunty
When the machines start dancing?

337
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,720
It's Vik from planet Earth, sir.

338
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:47,720
It's Vik...897321XBCZT.

339
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:50,799
Hello? Hello? Nyapcha?

340
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,200
What is it now?

341
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,720
I've found a gadget.

342
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,079
A hatchet?

343
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,880
Not hatchet.
A gadget.

344
00:25:58,119 --> 00:25:59,440
A sleeping gadget.

345
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,720
So what?

346
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,839
If I bring it,
will you take me back?

347
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,079
What?

348
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,319
I mean, everyone in Nyapcha
suffers from insomnia, so...

349
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,359
If you try to come back,
I'll break your legs.

350
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:13,680
Worthless fellow!

351
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:17,119
Nyapcha...

352
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,319
There it is.

353
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,559
It's back.

354
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:24,319
There it is again.

355
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,960
Aghor! What an ill-omen!

356
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,359
Oh Heavens!
It's the apocalypse!

357
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:36,160
I knew this would happen!

358
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:40,160
Dooms Day!

359
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:44,359
Lord Krishna's sword is coming at us!

360
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:50,240
For last three days,
it's been hovering over us.

361
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:54,880
You had to pull it down on us?

362
00:26:55,240 --> 00:27:00,279
Your machines won't save us now.

363
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:08,799
Oh Lord, forgive me.

364
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,839
I'll never ask for
a mouse-trap again.

365
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:18,839
Please take back your sword.

366
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,920
(chanting)

367
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:47,160
The tin-ghost is circling
over our heads!

368
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:49,000
(chanting)

369
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,960
My God!

370
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:04,960
-All hail the goddess!
-All hail the goddess!

371
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,319
Hello, sir.

372
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,440
What news, Shyama?

373
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:12,480
It's useless to loot the
royal palace of Murgihata.

374
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,839
The mutiny sepoys have
swiped all the treasure.

375
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:18,240
Imbecile!

376
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,200
-No wealth in the palace.
-None.

377
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,839
-No gold with goldsmiths.
-None.

378
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,319
-No grain in the barns.
-None.

379
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:26,160
But tomorrow on new moon night,
we have to loot something.

380
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,839
How about we look up try
Aghor Sen's house, sir?

381
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,680
-Who?
-The one who dabbles in machines.

382
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,359
-Oh really?
-I've heard he has a lot of money.

383
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,440
Is it so?

384
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,480
Yes, sir.

385
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:42,039
He buys diamond, pearls and gold.

386
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:45,400
-I'm sure he has a mint at home.
-Is it?

387
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:47,640
Shyama, tell sir.

388
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,759
Sir, he counts his guineas all night.

389
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:58,839
He tells his aunt that he has
something very unique.

390
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,400
Excellent.

391
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:03,599
Tomorrow Aghor pays us taxes.

392
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,200
But he has ghosts.

393
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,640
To guard his house.

394
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:11,759
Do you know that, Priest?

395
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:14,079
I've heard rumours too.

396
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:16,119
To hell with your rumours!

397
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:20,200
He has two lackeys.
But they aren't human, Boss.

398
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:24,000
I've seen one grow as tall as
the moon in the evening.

399
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:27,039
And the other's no hair.

400
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,640
That man's got a tin ghost too.

401
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,599
It hovers in the sky.

402
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:33,720
Sh-Shut up...
Shut up!

403
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:38,039
Is it true that he has a mint ?

404
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:40,119
-Yes sir.
-Alright.

405
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:47,079
-All hail the Goddess!
-All hail the Goddess!

406
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,160
NISCHINTIPUR SPORTING CLUB
ESTD 1972

407
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,960
"O omnipotent Creator
who wields all power."

408
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,000
O omnipotent Creator...

409
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:08,880
-"Who wields all power."
-Who wields all power.

410
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:12,519
-"What cosmic disruption is this, my Lord?"
-What cosmic disruption is this, my Lord?

411
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,440
"The day seems as black as night."

412
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,720
-"The day seems as black as night."
-The day seems as black as night.

413
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,240
"Apocalyptic destruction all round."

414
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:19,400
Apocalyptic...

415
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,519
-"...destruction all round." Damn you!
-...destruction all round.

416
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:24,200
-"Yet we hear the sounds of freedom."
-Yet we hear...

417
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,519
-What was it?
-Can't remember a single line!

418
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:31,839
I told you my Arthritis pills
are affecting my memory.

419
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,079
Stop with your music!
Can't you see we're arguing?

420
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:37,200
I wanted Krishna's role
but you didn't listen.

421
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:40,279
You won't always get what you want.

422
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:42,160
Where's Putna?

423
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,720
Put it over your ears.

424
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,160
-Bhoja, do you remember the lines?
-Yes.

425
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:52,359
Say, "Aha, a baby like a blossom."

426
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,440
Aha... Aha...

427
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,720
Yes, go on.
Keep trying, you can do it.

428
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,279
Blossom... Blossom...
Yes, keep going.

429
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:02,480
Don't be nervous.

430
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:03,960
He can do it.

431
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,079
Now try.

432
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:08,079
Blossom.

433
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:09,920
Nonsense!

434
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,519
He will take a long time.

435
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,559
Why don't you finish
my scene first?

436
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,480
I have to open my shop also.

437
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,359
Try, you got this.

438
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:23,039
Let's do the Kangsa's scene first.

439
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,079
What?

440
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:25,880
-Is this play a joke?
-Don't make a scene.

441
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,240
Fine! I don't cares.

442
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,039
Bhoja, you are off.
We will do yours tomorrow.

443
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:32,559
Say your lines.

444
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,920
"Your nemesis is
growing up in Gokul."

445
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,200
Oh my! Look at him!

446
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Hey, don't ruin the food.

447
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,039
Good God!

448
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:47,880
"Your nemesis is growing up in Gokul.

449
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,920
Beware! Beware!

450
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,240
-Beware!"
-Is he acting or playing football?

451
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:57,000
"...growing up in Gokul."

452
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,160
Hey.

453
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:01,680
Hey!

454
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:03,640
This is the place.

455
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:08,119
"Whose voices do I hear?
Whose--"

456
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:10,200
-Who are you?
-I'm Subuddhi Roy.

457
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,599
-Who?
-Is this Kusum Kunj?

458
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:15,440
Is this Kusum Kunj?

459
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,799
-Yes.
-Thank God.

460
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:21,640
But the deal was that the house
will be sold after the festival.

461
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:25,119
We will not sell our house.
We will stay here.

462
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,799
He is the owner of this house.

463
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,720
Did the witch-doctor send you?

464
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:31,640
They're also talking
about ghosts, Keto.

465
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,319
The lawyer said this is our house.

466
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:34,519
Which lawyer?

467
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:37,720
But we always thought
this house...

468
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:39,440
-Had no heir?
-Exactly.

469
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,519
That's not true.
The snake charmer gave it away.

470
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:42,680
-The snake charmer?
-Who?

471
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,240
Here, we have the deed.

472
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,680
-Let me see.
-Take a look.

473
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:51,319
It's written on the front page.

474
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,359
What's your name?

475
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,359
I'm Subuddhi Roy
and this is my nephew, Kartik Bose.

476
00:32:57,359 --> 00:32:58,519
-Oh.
-And you?

477
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,880
-We are locals here.
-Yes.

478
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,000
Putting up a play
for the Durga festival.

479
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:06,519
We hold rehearsals in this vacant house.

480
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:07,880
Very good.

481
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:12,480
Now that you're here,
we can rehearse somewhere else...

482
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,519
No, no. Why will you leave?

483
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,079
-You'll be living here.
-So?

484
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:21,200
-We don't want to bother you.
-We won't have a problem.

485
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,640
Keto, go get our bags.

486
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:32,559
(indistinct chatter)

487
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,759
These are binoculars,
not a soda bottle.

488
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,759
Oh!

489
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,519
(indistinct chatter)

490
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,559
So lively.

491
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,240
(indistinct chatter)

492
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,199
(indistinct chatter)

493
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,280
These are all back dated plays.
These won't work.

494
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,199
Theatre is a serious thing.

495
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:32,599
In the city, I used to act
and direct the plays.

496
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:34,920
Your play is too out dated.

497
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,960
But we have been working on it
for a long time so changing it now...

498
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,800
Siraj-ud-Daulah!
Heard of him?

499
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,519
The name sounds familiar.

500
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,039
I know I've heard it somewhere...

501
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:45,679
Sit down.

502
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,000
He was related to grand daughter-in-law
of Bahadur Shah.

503
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,480
The ruler of Bengal
who was killed.

504
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:54,199
Mir Jafar! Yes, yes.
Mir Jafar had killed him.

505
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:57,159
Mohammed Ibaig killed
him with a dagger.

506
00:35:04,039 --> 00:35:05,079
"Linping Lang!"

507
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:07,360
Stop your gibberish.

508
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:10,079
Show me what weapons
you have brought.

509
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,880
If I like it, I will pay for it.

510
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,239
The Big Battle Box.

511
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:27,639
Start talking.

512
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,480
All you do is give a box each
to your soldiers.

513
00:35:31,559 --> 00:35:33,599
You will win the battle.

514
00:35:33,639 --> 00:35:38,079
This box has everything.
Guns, bombs, bedrooms, bathrooms...

515
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,559
She smiled!

516
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,239
The Big Battle Box!

517
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:08,639
For God's sake,
fire the damn gun.

518
00:36:08,679 --> 00:36:10,000
Quickly! Quickly!

519
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:32,480
The Big Battle Box.

520
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,360
Begum!

521
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:42,119
Throw them out!
I will feed them to the lions!

522
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:43,440
Please calm down, ma'am.

523
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,079
I don't obey you!

524
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:47,880
Broke everything...

525
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:51,119
This is what I get
for spending tons of money?

526
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,960
-Stop!
-Catch him!

527
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,119
Is Tekka back?

528
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:58,079
Is he back or not?

529
00:36:58,679 --> 00:37:00,760
He isn't.
I knew it.

530
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:05,719
Spouted nonsense about
a sleep machine and disappeared!

531
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:12,039
Remember if I don't get that device,
I won't let anyone sleep a wink!

532
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,559
Connect me to Nischintipur.

533
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:16,840
"No, Your Highness, no.

534
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:21,559
My dreams have been shattered
by the cries of the people of Bengal."

535
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,440
The cries of the people of Bengal...

536
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:26,800
"This throne brings no more pleasure."

537
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:29,760
(indistinct)

538
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,920
"There is only misfortunes
in Bengal's fate today."

539
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:38,519
Hello! Hello! Operation Sleep.

540
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:41,000
Hello! Tuning in... Nischintipur.

541
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:44,239
Hello! Operation Sleep.
Hello! Tuning in to Nischintipur.

542
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,159
What's happening, Uncle?

543
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,199
Silly detective plays.

544
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:51,840
Go to sleep.

545
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,599
Begum here.

546
00:37:53,719 --> 00:37:55,159
How long will you loiter around?

547
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:56,119
Your Highness.

548
00:37:56,199 --> 00:37:57,880
Work was going on well.

549
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:01,079
The Doctor had just
one more house to go.

550
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,840
-In Kusum Kunj.
-Where's the weapon?

551
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,800
Just one more week.

552
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,880
Where's that idiot doctor?

553
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:06,519
Uh, he is...

554
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:12,000
If needed we will get the house vacated.

555
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:16,199
Or else I will play football
with your heads.

556
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,000
Goal...

557
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,559
This isn't a play.

558
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,119
They are talking about Nischintipur.

559
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:27,639
About our house.

560
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,039
Uncle.

561
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,280
Hey, Uncle!

562
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:01,920
(singing)

563
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:12,719
Did you sleep well?

564
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:14,239
Yes.

565
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,159
Beautiful village, isn't it?

566
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:19,559
No worries in Nischintipur.

567
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,159
(singing)

568
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:23,280
Oh no!

569
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,719
-Hey, Keto, look at this.
-What?

570
00:39:25,719 --> 00:39:29,159
What's this?
Are they all blind?

571
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,000
Uncle!

572
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:34,679
"Operation Sleep."

573
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:53,119
You can search from Kashi to Gaya

574
00:39:53,599 --> 00:40:01,599
But you won't find a more inauspicious man

575
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:08,280
You can search from Kashi to Gaya

576
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,559
But you won't find a more inauspicious man

577
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:17,320
You can search from Kashi to Gaya

578
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:21,280
But you won't find a more inauspicious man

579
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,039
If you look at me by chance

580
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:33,559
If you look at me by chance

581
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:38,599
Know you brought trouble on yourself

582
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:46,519
I shall throw a spanner in your works

583
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:55,840
Rest assured, I will ruin all

584
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:01,159
You can search from Kashi to Gaya

585
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:05,199
But you won't find a more inauspicious man

586
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:14,519
A look from me is all you need

587
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:19,119
To make your luck rot for sure

588
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:23,719
Just one look

589
00:41:23,719 --> 00:41:28,159
A look from me is all you need

590
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:32,800
To make your luck rot for sure

591
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:37,480
Your pretty garden with flowers

592
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:44,320
Oh, what a pretty garden

593
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:48,880
Your pretty garden with flowers

594
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,480
Will wither in a matter of seconds

595
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:57,920
You can search from Kashi to Gaya

596
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:01,679
But you won't find a more inauspicious man

597
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:06,320
You can search from Kashi to Gaya

598
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:10,119
You can search from Kashi to Gaya

599
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:13,679
You can search from Kashi to Gaya

600
00:42:13,719 --> 00:42:17,039
You can search from Kashi to Gaya

601
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:21,199
You can search from Kashi to Gaya

602
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:27,719
But you won't find a more inauspicious man

603
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,159
All hail the Lord.

604
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:34,280
Vegetables from my Garden, Gobindo.

605
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,519
All hail the Lord.
Vegetables from my Garden, Gobindo.

606
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:37,960
Keep them in my balcony.

607
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,079
Let's go.

608
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,960
Are you new to this village?

609
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,559
-Yes, that's the house.
-Yesterday.

610
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:55,199
Guessed as much.

611
00:42:55,199 --> 00:43:00,400
Or you wouldn't have looked at me
and walked with me.

612
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,800
That's what I want to know.
What's going on?

613
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,920
The villagers are fumbling about
as if they're blind.

614
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,159
Didn't you hear me?

615
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:10,760
You can search from Kashi to Gaya.

616
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,440
But you won't find a more inauspicious man.

617
00:43:14,719 --> 00:43:15,920
-Inauspicious man?
-Huh?

618
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:18,320
Harbinger of bad luck.

619
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:20,920
Nobody wants to see
my face in the morning--

620
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,880
So they shut their eyes and run home?

621
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:25,760
Good! He is a bright boy.

622
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,559
-Brother?
-Nephew.

623
00:43:29,159 --> 00:43:31,599
What about those vegetables?

624
00:43:31,639 --> 00:43:33,000
That's my fees.

625
00:43:33,639 --> 00:43:36,280
I am blessed with a client or two.

626
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,440
Oh. Are you a lawyer as well?

627
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:40,599
-Didn't you understand?
-No.

628
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Have a grudge against someone?
Want someone to suffer?

629
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:49,119
Just show them my face
and they'll be doomed for a week.

630
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,960
You're a walking hazard!

631
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,039
Dangerous!

632
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:59,239
Just a glimpse of my whiskers
and you're damned.

633
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,320
And you are?

634
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,360
Subuddhi Roy.

635
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,880
My nephew, Kartik Bose.

636
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,039
Just moved here.

637
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:08,119
I am Gobindo the Inauspicious.

638
00:44:09,239 --> 00:44:10,320
No surname?

639
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,440
I used to have one.

640
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:13,280
It's 'Biswas'.

641
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:18,199
But with time, I became Mr. Inauspicious.

642
00:44:20,119 --> 00:44:22,639
You can call it a surname or a nickname.

643
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:24,840
-Uncle, move!
-Keto!

644
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,320
-Uncle!
-You shouldn't have seen my face.

645
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:30,320
What the hell?
You almost run me over!

646
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,880
-Sell your house.
-Huh? What do you mean?

647
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:38,079
"Jack fell down and broke his crown
And Jill came tumbling after."

648
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,519
What Jack and Jill?

649
00:44:39,559 --> 00:44:41,199
You have to days.

650
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,000
Sell us your house and get lost.

651
00:44:44,039 --> 00:44:45,039
No.

652
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,840
-Two days.
-We won't sell the house.

653
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,039
Oh my God!

654
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:12,360
"If you look at me by chance..."
I knew it!

655
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,239
No, no. Don't look at me.

656
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:19,159
Tell me if you need any help.
I don't take fees from neighbours.

657
00:45:19,159 --> 00:45:21,039
Okay, bye.

658
00:45:21,679 --> 00:45:25,760
-"You can search from Kashi to Gaya..."
-All hail the Lord!

659
00:45:28,199 --> 00:45:29,800
(indistinct chatter)

660
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,480
"Flee?"

661
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,719
"You ask me to flee?

662
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,639
Me, flee?

663
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,320
You expect me to flee?"

664
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:24,960
-"What of my kingdom, Mir Qasim?"
-What of my kingdom, Mir Qasim?

665
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,239
Mir Qasim! Right, right.

666
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,840
What of my kingdom, Mir Qasim?

667
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:31,320
Your lines, "Mir Qasim!"

668
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,400
He's worthless!

669
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:36,239
-Say your lines, dammit!
-"You first have to to take our land--"

670
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:38,239
"A smidgen of our land."

671
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,880
-"A smidgen of our land."
-I give up.

672
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,119
I just got a new set of dentures.

673
00:46:43,159 --> 00:46:45,159
-To hell with that!
-Idiot!

674
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:47,960
(indistinct yelling)

675
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:50,719
-Just give him that role instead.
-Oh, yes!

676
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:55,920
Uncle! You play the role
of Mohammad Ibaig.

677
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,280
Who is Mohammad Ibaig?

678
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,760
It's a small role.
You can easily memorise the lines.

679
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,159
Just knife Siraj-ud-Daulah
in the last scene.

680
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:05,400
-That's all.
-Can't do it.

681
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:08,079
I can't stab anyone at my age.

682
00:47:08,119 --> 00:47:10,719
-Why not? It's just a play...
-Impossible...

683
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:12,800
Kanu! My dear Kanu!

684
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:15,800
You've played a villain before.

685
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:18,840
And an epic villain.

686
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,280
-Then why don't you take this role?
-What role?

687
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,800
The role of Mohammad Ibaig.

688
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:25,280
Are you crazy?

689
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:30,360
I can't be a villain who murders.

690
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,440
Can I do it?

691
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,599
-Who's that?
-You'll play a dead soldier.

692
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,519
Get out!

693
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:46,719
(indistinct chatter)

694
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:15,199
Hey! Look in front.

695
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,480
There he goes.

696
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:11,840
How about your nephew, Subuddhi?

697
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:12,880
-Keto?
-Yes.

698
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:14,840
He's too thin.
Looks like a potato on a stick!

699
00:50:15,039 --> 00:50:17,519
Won't suit the character
of Mohammad Ibaig.

700
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:19,480
He can only play the princess.

701
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:22,960
-Look this is no good.
-Right.

702
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,079
If we don't find someone suitable,
let's think of another play.

703
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:27,519
-Change the play again? No way!
-No need, hear me out.

704
00:50:27,559 --> 00:50:29,679
-I'll find the perfect Mohammad Ibaig.
-How?

705
00:50:29,679 --> 00:50:31,760
If not, I'll play the role myself.

706
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,880
You will murder and get murdered?

707
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:35,440
-That won't do.
-It'll be okay.

708
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:36,679
How?

709
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,199
Can you play this?

710
00:50:40,199 --> 00:50:43,159
Ricket-rocket, pond a picket,
Ghoul a googly.

711
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:51,280
Ricket-rocket, pond a picket,
Ghoul a googly.

712
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:56,400
I can play any role
You want me to

713
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:02,280
I can play any role
You want me to

714
00:51:02,719 --> 00:51:06,119
I can play the villain
I can play the hero

715
00:51:06,519 --> 00:51:09,639
"You are praising me.

716
00:51:10,199 --> 00:51:14,719
-But I don't want to be the king anymore."
-Wonderful.

717
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:17,639
I can play the villain
I can play the hero

718
00:51:17,679 --> 00:51:20,920
I'm talented enough
Got it, guys?

719
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:26,039
I can play any role
You want me to

720
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:33,000
The workaholic or the dreamer

721
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:37,719
-"Is this a theatre or play?"
-Lovely!

722
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:41,159
"Can you give me back
20 years of my life?"

723
00:51:41,159 --> 00:51:43,079
-Extraordinary!
-Too good!

724
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,280
I can play the workaholic
I can play the dreamer

725
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:49,639
I can even play the heroine

726
00:51:52,199 --> 00:51:58,039
I can play the deity of sentimentality

727
00:51:58,119 --> 00:52:02,039
And flood everyone's eyes and hearts

728
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:07,920
I can play the deity of sentimentality

729
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,000
And flood everyone's eyes and hearts

730
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:14,000
I can do that too.

731
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:19,440
The best and biggest
Legendary actresses I can play

732
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:20,920
"Don't touch me!"

733
00:52:21,079 --> 00:52:24,039
Just tell me what you need

734
00:52:24,159 --> 00:52:27,280
The hero or heroine
Or even the villain

735
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:28,559
The crowd will cheer

736
00:52:28,599 --> 00:52:30,480
"What a good actor!"

737
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:34,599
I will bring out tears of sorrow

738
00:52:34,719 --> 00:52:38,719
I will bring out tears of laughter

739
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:44,280
Sometimes I'll get mad

740
00:52:44,679 --> 00:52:48,199
Or shower love

741
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:54,400
(singing)

742
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,159
Just stop singing.

743
00:52:57,519 --> 00:53:01,159
Please stop.

744
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:07,599
I can play any role
You want me to

745
00:53:07,639 --> 00:53:13,400
I can play any role
You want me to

746
00:53:15,239 --> 00:53:17,400
Keto, did you get the prawn?

747
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,840
He's a powerhouse!

748
00:53:22,039 --> 00:53:25,000
What happened?
How did you get hurt?

749
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:27,880
These are crude village roads.

750
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,440
He's probably not used to
riding the bicycle in the dark.

751
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:31,719
So he fell....

752
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:34,039
-Move!
-It's okay, I'm not hurt.

753
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,639
-Make way.
-Leave me, I'm fine.

754
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:37,440
-What happened?
-No need to worry...

755
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,159
He fell off his cycle.

756
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:42,679
-I'm alright.
-You shouldn't ride in the dark, son.

757
00:53:42,679 --> 00:53:44,880
-This must be your bag.
-Thank you.

758
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,400
Don't worry, he'll be fine...

759
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,400
Bring him to me.
I'll give him a tetanus shot.

760
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:50,079
You might give him
the wrong pills by mistake.

761
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:51,039
Idiot!

762
00:53:51,079 --> 00:53:53,039
-Who are you?
-I'm Bhootnath Nandy.

763
00:53:53,079 --> 00:53:54,480
-I'm new here.
-Oh.

764
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,840
-I'm Subuddhi Roy. I'm also new here.
-Hello.

765
00:53:57,559 --> 00:53:59,079
Just got here recently.

766
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:02,119
That's my nephew..
If you weren't there...

767
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:05,079
-Tea? Milk?
-No, thanks.

768
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:08,360
He is Dr. Bhola.
He is Samaj Mitra.

769
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:09,559
He is...

770
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:12,280
-Bhootnath Nandy.
-Right. He's new to the village.

771
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:13,440
Mohammad Ibaig...

772
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:16,039
Oh yes, do you act?
Will you act in our play?

773
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:18,840
-Me? No way!
-You can do it.

774
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:21,199
Impossible.
I'm not cut out for it.

775
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,679
I should get going.

776
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,719
-Bye, Kartik.
You're leaving?

777
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:25,679
For today.

778
00:54:25,719 --> 00:54:28,519
-Please come again.
-Of course, I'll come to see you.

779
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:33,880
Remember to be careful, okay?

780
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:37,199
Be smart and don't be afraid.

781
00:54:37,199 --> 00:54:38,320
If you need anything--

782
00:54:43,519 --> 00:54:45,239
(indistinct chatter)

783
00:54:57,199 --> 00:54:58,320
Bhootnath?

784
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:09,079
Samaj Grandpa says these sculptures
have been here since when he was a kid.

785
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,559
Bravo!

786
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,199
(humming)

787
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:22,519
"Rolly-Polly eight little dolls,
On sevens and lives no foot falls.

788
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:25,079
Those who tread the middle path,
Will solve the puzzle.

789
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:27,920
-Hey, ghost-doctor.
-Yes, sir?

790
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,400
"Those who tread the middle path..."

791
00:56:31,199 --> 00:56:35,159
Let's see your pretty face.

792
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:45,199
So, what did you tell the boy?

793
00:56:46,159 --> 00:56:50,159
Told him to be smart and to be brave.

794
00:56:50,719 --> 00:56:53,320
Pearls of wisdom.

795
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:59,199
And what about breaking
into that house?

796
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,239
Let me deal with that.

797
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:04,599
If you cross the line,
you will suffer.

798
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:09,880
What will you get
by scaring a little boy?

799
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:13,519
A lot.
We'll get a lot out of it!

800
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,000
Where's the weapon?

801
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:16,440
In the underground chamber.

802
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,480
-When will you open it?
-After I crack the riddle.

803
00:57:18,519 --> 00:57:20,079
Then crack it!

804
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:29,360
What the hell!

805
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:33,440
You'll know your place
when you get a taste of Begum's whip.

806
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:36,440
-Hey, let it go.
-Trying to override me, huh?

807
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,239
I am Tekka!

808
00:57:39,679 --> 00:57:42,800
"Rolly-Polly eight little dolls,
On sevens and fives no foot falls."

809
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,719
Let it go.

810
00:57:48,239 --> 00:57:51,440
"Rolly-Polly eight little dolls,
On sevens and fives no foot falls."

811
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:54,039
(indistinct yelling)

812
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:29,480
"Rolly-Polly eight little dolls,
On sevens and fives no foot falls."

813
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,679
Rolly-Polly eight little dolls...

814
00:58:38,119 --> 00:58:42,280
"Rolly-Polly eight little dolls,
On sevens and fives no foot falls."

815
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:49,480
Rolly-Polly eight little dolls,
On sevens and fives no foot falls...

816
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,840
Rolly-Polly eight little dolls,
On sevens and fives no foot falls...

817
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:58,039
Worthless!

818
00:59:00,159 --> 00:59:01,320
Who's there?

819
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:05,280
If you haven't solve the riddle yet...

820
00:59:05,719 --> 00:59:06,599
Who is it?

821
00:59:06,639 --> 00:59:08,719
You don't deserve the gadget.

822
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:11,679
Who's there?
Come out.

823
00:59:16,519 --> 00:59:20,119
-Who's there?
-It's me, Aghor Sen.

824
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:21,480
Good Lord!

825
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:32,320
Why do you look like
you saw a ghost?

826
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:34,639
Feeling scared?

827
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:38,559
Yes...a little bit.

828
00:59:38,599 --> 00:59:39,679
Rubbish!

829
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,880
You call yourself a scientist?

830
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:48,559
What's so scary?

831
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:51,639
Do you freak out...

832
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:54,639
when you listen to songs by a dead person
or see their pictures?

833
00:59:54,679 --> 00:59:57,079
But that's only an impression.

834
00:59:57,239 --> 01:00:00,119
Understand science properly.

835
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:02,039
Then you'll understand the spirit world.

836
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:03,920
They're impressions too.

837
01:00:04,239 --> 01:00:05,679
The faint past.

838
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:14,639
Suffering the results of counting your
chickens before they've hatched.

839
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:16,519
Yes.

840
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,119
(vocalising)

841
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:24,360
You haven't suffered the worst yet.

842
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,280
What do you mean?

843
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:28,760
Vik...

844
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:34,400
It'll be hell when he wakes up.

845
01:00:35,559 --> 01:00:36,840
Vik?

846
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,159
Who is Vik?

847
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:42,280
Idiot! Don't even know him?

848
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:46,280
-How would I know?
-Why?

849
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:50,840
There is nothing in about it in your diary.
It ends right here.

850
01:00:51,559 --> 01:00:52,599
Oh.

851
01:00:52,679 --> 01:00:53,880
I didn't write it?

852
01:00:54,039 --> 01:00:57,679
Vik...is from another planet.

853
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,519
It was a new moon night.

854
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:05,960
Everything went Topsy-turvy that night.

855
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:11,639
If I was alive,
I'd still get goose bumps.

856
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:14,559
I had just sat down for dinner.

857
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,400
That's when I heard the robbers' cries!

858
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:23,599
The skies lit up with a flaming red.

859
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:24,880
I saw from my balcony...

860
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:29,000
Madhai's bandits had
broken the main gate.

861
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:32,320
Waikiki on the other hand...

862
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:36,960
had climbed up to the terrace.

863
01:01:37,679 --> 01:01:40,599
With a fish net tied to his waist.

864
01:01:41,719 --> 01:01:43,000
Bandits entered our house.

865
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:50,519
Chang tip-toed through the darkness.

866
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:55,679
My gadget?
Where is my gadget?

867
01:01:57,559 --> 01:01:59,480
I was lightning struck
when I remembered...

868
01:02:00,639 --> 01:02:02,639
that it's in the underground chamber.

869
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:03,920
And that's where...

870
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:05,039
...my aunt was.

871
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:08,519
Meanwhile, Madhai was hollering at me.

872
01:02:08,519 --> 01:02:13,840
"Aghor, hand over your minting machine.
Or we will kill you all"

873
01:02:14,159 --> 01:02:17,239
He really thought I had
a minting machine!

874
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:18,760
Then suddenly...

875
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:20,639
Waikiki threw his net...

876
01:02:20,719 --> 01:02:23,519
...over the bandits.

877
01:02:23,559 --> 01:02:27,760
All except Madhai and two more
got caught in the net.

878
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:30,440
Chang jumped into the courtyard...

879
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:32,159
...with a sword in hand.

880
01:02:33,679 --> 01:02:34,800
At that very moment...

881
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:38,639
the backdoor opened with a slam
and in came Vik.

882
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:41,199
A bandit screamed out.

883
01:02:41,199 --> 01:02:44,280
"That's the old man's tin-ghost!"

884
01:02:45,079 --> 01:02:48,480
Vik took out something.

885
01:02:48,519 --> 01:02:53,719
It looked like a water pistol.
The moment he pressed the switch...

886
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:58,440
The courtyard was filled
with a red light.

887
01:02:59,639 --> 01:03:03,239
Madhai and his robbers
vanished into thin air.

888
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,400
Everyone disappeared.

889
01:03:06,679 --> 01:03:07,800
Vanished!

890
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:13,599
Then? What happened then?

891
01:03:13,639 --> 01:03:15,639
I'd lost my mind.

892
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:17,679
I grabbed a lantern...

893
01:03:18,519 --> 01:03:22,039
...and ran towards Vik.

894
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,880
Vik also aimed his weapon at me.

895
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:29,320
Suddenly, I heard my gadget play.

896
01:03:30,599 --> 01:03:35,639
It sounded so magical that night.

897
01:03:37,079 --> 01:03:41,559
Vik went quiet for a moment
before he collapsed...

898
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:43,119
...and fell asleep.

899
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:49,320
I turned around to see my aunt
weilding my gadget.

900
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:56,440
Has Vik woken up yet?

901
01:03:56,679 --> 01:03:58,199
Any time now.

902
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:03,199
He might ravage Nischintipur
till he finds the gadget.

903
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:07,559
He has brawn, but no brains.

904
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:13,840
What should I do now?

905
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:16,000
Use your brains and fight.

906
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:19,960
If you can, hand Vik over
to Planet Nyapcha.

907
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:21,800
He's a piece of trash.

908
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:24,840
It's time for me to go.

909
01:04:25,199 --> 01:04:26,760
I'm late.

910
01:04:27,079 --> 01:04:29,960
I've to attend Archimedes' lecture
at the Science Council.

911
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,559
-And then Newton.
-Wait--

912
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:34,960
Where can I find Archimedes..,
I mean, Vik?

913
01:04:35,679 --> 01:04:38,480
I'd left him by the marshes.

914
01:04:40,519 --> 01:04:42,320
in the Nilkuthi Forest.

915
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:56,800
(humming)

916
01:05:01,079 --> 01:05:02,119
Nice.

917
01:05:04,119 --> 01:05:06,280
You know, Bhootnath,
this place is haunted.

918
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:07,360
What?

919
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:08,719
Don't you know?

920
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:11,960
"The bandit spooks." They sacrifice goats
as offering on new moon nights.

921
01:05:12,039 --> 01:05:13,119
Is it so?

922
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:14,679
Goats have ghosts too?

923
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:16,400
I swear it's true.

924
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:21,320
They'd once come for tea
to Potol's tea stall.

925
01:05:22,039 --> 01:05:25,800
When asked to pay,
they just cackled and vanished!

926
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:28,360
Really?

927
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:30,119
And what happened to Potol?

928
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,559
I've read many ghost stories.

929
01:05:37,719 --> 01:05:39,880
Do you believe in ghosts?

930
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:50,000
Hocus, pocus, bogus
Abracadabra!

931
01:05:55,079 --> 01:05:56,400
See?

932
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:59,440
How did you do that?

933
01:06:03,559 --> 01:06:07,079
If you're aware, it's just a magnet.
Or else, it's a ghost.

934
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:15,880
Last night, an old man
in a white robe appeared.

935
01:06:16,719 --> 01:06:19,960
He had a big mustache, a long beard
and ragged hair.

936
01:06:21,239 --> 01:06:23,280
-You know what he said?
-What?

937
01:06:23,519 --> 01:06:26,679
He said that if you believe in science...

938
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:34,280
then ghosts are a kind of impression.

939
01:06:34,719 --> 01:06:35,920
Prescription?

940
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:38,159
What?

941
01:06:41,679 --> 01:06:43,519
A prescription?

942
01:06:45,199 --> 01:06:47,159
Do you know how many
ghosts haunt Nischintipur?

943
01:06:47,199 --> 01:06:48,280
How many?

944
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,559
Millions and billions!

945
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:51,679
Who told you that?

946
01:06:51,719 --> 01:06:53,320
You don't know anything.

947
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,880
Some people are buying old houses
to research on ghosts.

948
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:01,559
A ghost-doctor has come
to the village too.

949
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,639
And he came with four men.

950
01:07:04,159 --> 01:07:06,400
-Who?
-Bad guys.

951
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:11,599
Don't you know?
That black car is theirs.

952
01:07:12,119 --> 01:07:13,519
How did you know?

953
01:07:13,559 --> 01:07:16,400
They came to buy our house.

954
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:22,599
-They gave us two days to vacate.
-Is it?

955
01:07:22,639 --> 01:07:25,760
There are many ghosts in our house
so it's selling at a high price.

956
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:30,400
Have you seen the ghost-doctor?

957
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:31,920
He is invisible.

958
01:07:33,559 --> 01:07:34,639
Why?

959
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:36,360
Is he ghost too?

960
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:40,119
No! But he wears a cape
and wanders around at night.

961
01:07:40,239 --> 01:07:42,400
-A cape?
-He is this tall!

962
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,079
He holds a candle in one hand
and a telescope in the other.

963
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:47,360
Telescope?

964
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:48,440
Yes.

965
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:55,119
Doctor Grandpa saw him
when he was outside smoking a joint.

966
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:59,079
I found a riddle.

967
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:02,079
Let's see if you can solve it.

968
01:08:02,719 --> 01:08:03,719
Riddle?

969
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:06,880
"Rolly-Polly eight little dolls,
On sevens and fives no foot falls.

970
01:08:07,719 --> 01:08:10,880
Those who tread the middle path,
Will solve the puzzle.

971
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:14,440
Here's a conch and here's a ring,
Those who seek will find the thing.

972
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:19,039
Step on the lotus,
To get to the underground chamber."

973
01:08:19,479 --> 01:08:20,520
What do you think?

974
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:21,520
Why the lotus?

975
01:08:22,039 --> 01:08:24,840
Because it's the flower of Paradise.

976
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,479
-Do you know what the riddle means?
-No.

977
01:08:28,079 --> 01:08:31,000
Bhootnath, what is
in the underground chamber?

978
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:32,520
Hidden treasures?

979
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:36,319
Something even more precious.

980
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,760
It's about 150 years old.

981
01:08:40,479 --> 01:08:44,159
An amazing sleep machine.

982
01:08:46,279 --> 01:08:48,399
(humming)

983
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:52,439
I think the ghost-doctor
is looking for that machine.

984
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,359
Ghosts aren't real, right?

985
01:08:59,079 --> 01:09:00,279
Maybe.

986
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:04,800
But it's not just him.
Everyone is secretly looking for it.

987
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:13,880
Kings, queens, barons, counts...
You, me, Vik from Nyapcha... Everyone.

988
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:14,960
Vik from what?

989
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:16,680
Nyapcha.

990
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,680
Which country is that?

991
01:09:21,159 --> 01:09:23,840
What if I say it's not on Earth?

992
01:09:25,039 --> 01:09:26,119
Impossible!

993
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:32,560
Do you trust me, Kartik?

994
01:09:36,359 --> 01:09:39,920
That old man in the white robe told me.

995
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:42,880
He said that Vik is from Planet Nyapcha.

996
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:48,439
He came to look for the sleeping gadget
but fell asleep himself.

997
01:09:50,359 --> 01:09:51,920
How did the old man know?

998
01:09:52,199 --> 01:09:53,520
He knows everything.

999
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:00,000
Who is he?

1000
01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:05,479
Aghor Sen.

1001
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:51,199
My head feels heavy.

1002
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:56,239
It's bound to.
You slept for 15 long years.

1003
01:10:57,159 --> 01:10:58,439
I was asleep?

1004
01:11:01,239 --> 01:11:02,239
Sleep...

1005
01:11:05,319 --> 01:11:06,319
Does it...

1006
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:11,279
Does it make you feel all fuzzy?

1007
01:11:11,319 --> 01:11:14,199
Yes. It's worse if you're a dimwit.

1008
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:16,399
Who's the dimwit?

1009
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:19,359
It's you, my dear.

1010
01:11:20,239 --> 01:11:21,640
What exactly happened?

1011
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:25,680
Jog your memory and you'll remember.

1012
01:11:29,359 --> 01:11:33,239
I can't remember anything
when I'm hungry.

1013
01:11:34,479 --> 01:11:40,840
My soul is parched for
a bowl of "Larentharium" soup.

1014
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:46,720
Glutton! Old habits die hard.

1015
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,199
Yes, now I remember.

1016
01:11:54,359 --> 01:11:55,479
I remember!

1017
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:58,279
I'd eaten something.

1018
01:11:59,039 --> 01:12:02,720
And...they threw me out.

1019
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:09,439
Vik was thrown right out!

1020
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:15,359
Straight from Nyapcha
to Earth in his rickety space ship.

1021
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:19,199
Shut up, you jerk from Nyapcha!

1022
01:12:21,279 --> 01:12:27,800
"Rock-a-bye baby on the tree top..."
The old man's men threw him by the marsh.

1023
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:31,840
Yes, they threw me...

1024
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:37,319
Hoards of bats came charging at me
in the old man's house.

1025
01:12:38,079 --> 01:12:39,960
A tune...

1026
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:45,000
I felt dizzy and fell asleep.

1027
01:12:45,159 --> 01:12:50,079
The fool snored for 150 years.

1028
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:52,039
But you just said 15 years.

1029
01:12:52,079 --> 01:12:53,319
On Earth, it's 150 years.

1030
01:12:53,319 --> 01:12:57,880
So confusing, 15 or... 150!

1031
01:13:00,199 --> 01:13:02,520
What's that? Looks so...

1032
01:13:03,399 --> 01:13:05,640
...delicious and twisted.

1033
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:11,560
Twist and rack your brains like that
or you'll be in trouble.

1034
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:14,000
I've forgotten!

1035
01:13:15,199 --> 01:13:18,399
He thinks he can get away
by putting me to sleep?

1036
01:13:22,439 --> 01:13:28,479
Before anything else,
I'll yank that hag's head off

1037
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:30,920
Don't start eating instead.

1038
01:13:31,159 --> 01:13:33,560
I will, you jacka**!

1039
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,680
As if!

1040
01:13:41,079 --> 01:13:45,760
Isn't it tasty like a sweet?

1041
01:13:46,479 --> 01:13:49,640
Eat the powder from Nyapcha
if you're hungry.

1042
01:13:50,039 --> 01:13:52,319
You eat powder!
Disgusting creature!

1043
01:13:54,199 --> 01:13:56,439
Where are going dressed like that?

1044
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:57,920
Why?

1045
01:13:58,279 --> 01:14:02,359
If you go out dressed like that,
you'll be lynched.

1046
01:14:02,399 --> 01:14:04,319
Lynched?

1047
01:14:04,439 --> 01:14:06,560
Just take a look.

1048
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:13,800
What's this?

1049
01:14:16,319 --> 01:14:19,239
Where is the old Shiva temple?

1050
01:14:20,119 --> 01:14:24,079
No... Where's that old banyan tree?

1051
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:26,680
What happened?

1052
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:28,960
Everything has changed in 150 years.

1053
01:14:29,159 --> 01:14:33,000
You'll go crazy trying
to find the old man's house.

1054
01:14:33,159 --> 01:14:38,079
You have to find that sleep machine
at any cost.

1055
01:14:38,159 --> 01:14:41,600
But Nyapcha doesn't want it.

1056
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:45,279
So what?
Once we get that gadget...

1057
01:14:45,319 --> 01:14:51,680
...everyone will be in our grip.

1058
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:53,439
Just think about it.

1059
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:59,399
Everyone will be asleep
and you'll have all the food to yourself.

1060
01:15:10,479 --> 01:15:15,359
Greedy, weedy, ugly, wiry feet

1061
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:20,920
The devilish gang
from Planet Nyapcha

1062
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:27,119
No one can best us
In strength and intellect

1063
01:15:27,159 --> 01:15:33,000
Skulls filled with megabytes
Hearts filled with ram

1064
01:15:35,319 --> 01:15:37,560
We are a super race
Lords of the galaxy

1065
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:39,800
Our clan begins
Where history ends

1066
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:41,960
The universe is just a fraction
Of our world

1067
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,000
You loot and rob
For our satisfaction

1068
01:15:56,479 --> 01:16:01,439
Your brains are our programmed
In our systems

1069
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:07,159
We will pour radium jelly
Into your eyes

1070
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:13,039
If that doesn't scare you
Let the atomic gun speak

1071
01:16:13,079 --> 01:16:18,720
You can't flee anywhere
You are our guinea pigs

1072
01:16:21,359 --> 01:16:23,520
Rock and roll
Rock and roll

1073
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:25,760
A horse's egg can sprout
A trillion winged beasts

1074
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:27,880
If you act too smart
We'll break your legs

1075
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:30,880
The devilish gang
from Planet Nyapcha

1076
01:16:34,279 --> 01:16:39,439
Greedy, weedy, ugly, wiry feet

1077
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:45,199
The devilish gang
from Planet Nyapcha

1078
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:09,920
Bhootnath.

1079
01:17:14,079 --> 01:17:15,760
I'm Vik from Nyapcha!

1080
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,279
I have a gun!

1081
01:17:23,039 --> 01:17:25,880
Bang! Fire!

1082
01:17:33,239 --> 01:17:34,560
Bang! Boom!

1083
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:43,960
Hey, Bhootnath.

1084
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:45,920
Can you float with a pot in hand?

1085
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:49,319
-No.
-I can.

1086
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:57,840
Kartik, have you heard of Archimedes?

1087
01:17:57,880 --> 01:17:58,880
No.

1088
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:04,760
An ancient Greek scientist.

1089
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:11,000
He did extensive research a lot on
what will float and what will drown.

1090
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:19,880
Bhootnath, where did you get this diary?

1091
01:18:26,439 --> 01:18:30,199
My grandpa had an auction shop.

1092
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:33,039
There were so many strange things.

1093
01:18:33,359 --> 01:18:34,680
Antique telephones...

1094
01:18:35,319 --> 01:18:37,000
African wooden masks...

1095
01:18:37,439 --> 01:18:39,199
Chandeliers from royal households...

1096
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:40,640
Wax records...

1097
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:42,960
All sorts of clocks.

1098
01:18:43,439 --> 01:18:45,760
They all talked to each other.

1099
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:48,560
Crockery used by the kings...

1100
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:50,479
Tiffany glass table-lamps....

1101
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:53,439
Pens and ink pots...
Maps from around the world...

1102
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:55,239
Ivory toys...

1103
01:18:56,439 --> 01:18:58,399
It was a fantasy land.

1104
01:18:59,319 --> 01:19:03,319
I'd got there every chance I got.

1105
01:19:06,119 --> 01:19:08,840
A few months back, I went there again.

1106
01:19:09,479 --> 01:19:14,039
My Grandpa chuckled and
handed me an ornate box.

1107
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:17,079
I asked him what was inside.

1108
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:21,439
He said it has either
the philosophers' stone or a ball of mud!

1109
01:19:23,439 --> 01:19:24,560
The next morning...

1110
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:25,800
...he passed away.

1111
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:29,479
Inside the box was
a silver nutcracker...

1112
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:30,960
a couple of gold coins...

1113
01:19:31,159 --> 01:19:32,520
...and this diary.

1114
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:34,560
-Bhootnath.
-Yes?

1115
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:38,520
You'll be really happy
if find that gadget, won't you?

1116
01:19:40,399 --> 01:19:41,560
Don't know.

1117
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:42,840
Why not?

1118
01:19:44,159 --> 01:19:47,600
Scientists have nothing
to call their own.

1119
01:19:49,479 --> 01:19:52,560
I planned to thoroughly research it.

1120
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:55,199
But things became...

1121
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:04,560
If my uncle gets the gadget,
he'll snore forever.

1122
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:12,399
Your uncle is very happy, isn't he?

1123
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:15,000
-Yes, he's playing the lead role.
-I see.

1124
01:20:15,039 --> 01:20:17,359
Every morning he goes out
in search of the villain.

1125
01:20:18,279 --> 01:20:19,439
Then tells me...

1126
01:20:19,479 --> 01:20:26,439
to inform Poritosh the prompter
if I see anyone who looks like a killer!

1127
01:20:27,199 --> 01:20:29,560
"'Bleeding Plassey."

1128
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:36,560
A spine chilling, historic play,
"'Bleeding Plassey."

1129
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:40,560
"Bleeding Plassey."
Don't miss it.

1130
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:42,720
Hey!

1131
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:46,399
-Come to see the play.
-I will.

1132
01:20:46,439 --> 01:20:50,920
A spine chilling, historic play,
"'Bleeding Plassey."

1133
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:53,640
Bhootnath, will you go to see the play?

1134
01:20:56,840 --> 01:21:01,039
Your uncle had asked me
to play the role of the murderer too.

1135
01:21:01,239 --> 01:21:03,079
The role wouldn't suit you.

1136
01:21:03,319 --> 01:21:05,439
-Why not?
-You don't look the part.

1137
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:14,039
I've fixed a spring in my toy car
just like you told me to.

1138
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:15,520
Good.

1139
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:21,039
Did you see the black car again?

1140
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:25,600
That car really scared you, didn't it?

1141
01:21:26,439 --> 01:21:29,159
Those men.
They scared me.

1142
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:32,760
Are you scare of me?

1143
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:35,039
Come on! I know you.

1144
01:21:37,079 --> 01:21:39,920
What if I say
that I'm the ghost-doctor?

1145
01:21:40,439 --> 01:21:43,079
That those goons work for me?

1146
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:45,800
What do you mean?

1147
01:21:51,439 --> 01:21:53,039
I'll explain you everything.

1148
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:55,159
Maybe you'll understand.

1149
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:39,039
I don't hunt haunted houses anymore.

1150
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:43,760
If you are looking for a haunted house...

1151
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:45,800
Do you have Aghor's instrument?

1152
01:22:46,159 --> 01:22:47,239
Huh?

1153
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:49,920
Look at that!

1154
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:02,319
The boss is not here now.

1155
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:04,760
I'm not looking for your boss.

1156
01:23:05,399 --> 01:23:07,560
I'm looking for Aghor's instrument.

1157
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:09,439
A musical instrument?

1158
01:23:10,119 --> 01:23:13,600
I thought you were
looking for the boss.

1159
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:15,119
We have lots of musical instruments.

1160
01:23:15,159 --> 01:23:17,319
I'm repairing one right here.
We have new ones too.

1161
01:23:18,199 --> 01:23:19,439
What else do you have?

1162
01:23:19,479 --> 01:23:22,479
Percussions, cymbals, trinkets...

1163
01:23:22,479 --> 01:23:25,399
We can even get you
a keyboard from the city.

1164
01:23:25,479 --> 01:23:28,760
Please come in.
This way.

1165
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:37,760
Hey...

1166
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:45,960
He's a foreigner!
Talk in English.

1167
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:51,600
A for Accordion, B for Bongo,
D for Drums, G for Guitar.

1168
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:56,439
H for Harmonica, K for Kendang,
M for Marimba, O for Organ.

1169
01:23:56,479 --> 01:24:00,199
P for Piano, S for Sitar,
T for Trombone.

1170
01:24:00,439 --> 01:24:06,600
V for Violin, X for Xylophone,
Y for Yamaha.

1171
01:24:07,119 --> 01:24:08,640
Good morning, ma'am.

1172
01:24:09,079 --> 01:24:10,319
You will get all these here.

1173
01:24:18,239 --> 01:24:19,319
No.

1174
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:29,199
I'll take these two.

1175
01:24:30,439 --> 01:24:31,479
And...

1176
01:24:34,239 --> 01:24:35,680
And this.

1177
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:38,720
-How much?
-He wants to buy right now.

1178
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:40,319
But boss is not here.

1179
01:24:40,359 --> 01:24:41,920
But he's paying for it.

1180
01:24:44,039 --> 01:24:46,119
It's coming to 4000 bucks.

1181
01:24:46,239 --> 01:24:48,720
Master, let me put
these in your car.

1182
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:51,840
Rs. 4000.

1183
01:25:20,159 --> 01:25:22,000
Mohammad Ibaig...

1184
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:24,479
Mohammad Ibaig...

1185
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:29,199
It's so difficult to find person
for the role.

1186
01:25:31,399 --> 01:25:35,680
So tiring.
This is pissing me off now.

1187
01:25:36,359 --> 01:25:37,760
What a ridiculous village!

1188
01:25:38,199 --> 01:25:40,199
Not a single theatre troupe.

1189
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:42,880
Useless clowns, all of them.

1190
01:25:44,359 --> 01:25:47,920
Your Highness Siraj-ud-Daulah,
please get me an Ibaig--

1191
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:04,399
Rolly-Polly...

1192
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:08,520
Rolly-Polly eight little dolls,
On sevens and fives no foot falls...

1193
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:11,000
Uff!
Impossible!

1194
01:26:11,439 --> 01:26:12,800
I can't do it properly.

1195
01:26:13,279 --> 01:26:15,239
I can't pull the strings
of the puppets right.

1196
01:26:16,279 --> 01:26:19,000
They puppets will simply
follow your lead.

1197
01:26:19,359 --> 01:26:20,439
Come here.

1198
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:21,800
Come to me.

1199
01:26:23,199 --> 01:26:25,119
Hold it like this, got it?

1200
01:26:25,199 --> 01:26:28,760
Watch me. Left hand like this
and the right like this.

1201
01:26:29,239 --> 01:26:30,439
And this is the head.

1202
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:31,800
-Oh!
-Can you do it?

1203
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:33,000
Yes! Want to see?

1204
01:26:35,479 --> 01:26:37,600
Rolly-Polly eight little dolls,
On sevens and fives no foot falls.

1205
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:39,760
Those who tread the middle path,
Will solve the puzzle.

1206
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:41,920
Here's a conch and here's a ring,
Those who seek will find the thing.

1207
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:43,399
Step on the lotus...

1208
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:46,359
Oh! I got it wrong again.

1209
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:52,319
Is that music or a battle cry?

1210
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:54,680
Oh my God!

1211
01:26:57,680 --> 01:26:59,560
Is it a choir of ghosts?

1212
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:00,960
God save me!

1213
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:06,640
If the ghosts live here,
there must be a king too.

1214
01:27:08,079 --> 01:27:14,600
The King of Ghosts blessed me with a boon

1215
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:16,520
The King of Ghosts blessed me...

1216
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:17,720
Who's that?

1217
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:21,319
Stop! Stop!
You'll break that too!

1218
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:23,119
I am Subuddhi Roy.

1219
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:24,640
Thank God.

1220
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:31,880
Ah! You're hungry and so...

1221
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:36,960
That very face!
Those very eyes!

1222
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:41,239
Excuse me, sir.

1223
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:47,680
I used to play at weddings.
May I play this?

1224
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:52,880
Once more.

1225
01:28:53,239 --> 01:28:54,359
Yes, yes.

1226
01:28:54,399 --> 01:28:58,039
Do you live in this village, sir?

1227
01:29:03,199 --> 01:29:07,159
Oh! You must be acting in plays.

1228
01:29:09,119 --> 01:29:11,520
Please do me a favour.

1229
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:15,920
For three days I've been going crazy
looking for someone to play Mohammad Ibaig.

1230
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,880
You are just perfect for the role.

1231
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:21,359
Please act in the play.
Please say yes.

1232
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:23,000
-Play it once again.
-Of course.

1233
01:29:23,039 --> 01:29:25,199
Whatever you say, sir.

1234
01:29:25,199 --> 01:29:27,439
(vocalising)

1235
01:29:27,479 --> 01:29:28,960
What's your name, sir?

1236
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:31,960
-Bhabol.
-Oh.

1237
01:29:32,239 --> 01:29:34,600
Bhabol! What a unique name.

1238
01:29:36,279 --> 01:29:38,600
-What happened?
I'm looking for...

1239
01:29:39,239 --> 01:29:41,199
Aghor's musical instrument.

1240
01:29:41,680 --> 01:29:44,399
-Do you know?
-Yes, of course. I know everything.

1241
01:29:44,439 --> 01:29:48,359
I know all kinds of musical genres.

1242
01:29:48,399 --> 01:29:51,399
The instrument you just mentioned?
I have loads of it at home.

1243
01:29:51,439 --> 01:29:53,560
Please come with me, sir.

1244
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:56,439
If you can get me Aghor's instrument...

1245
01:29:57,680 --> 01:29:59,520
...you'll get more gold coins.

1246
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:09,399
You know, Kartik?
This house belonged to Aghor Sen.

1247
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:14,479
Maybe it was up for sale
as there was no owner.

1248
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:17,119
Maybe your uncle bought it
at an auction.

1249
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:19,039
Who knows?

1250
01:30:19,479 --> 01:30:22,239
But the underground chamber
lies underneath this house.

1251
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:24,840
Remember those sculptures of dolls we saw?

1252
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:26,079
-In our courtyard?
-Yes.

1253
01:30:26,359 --> 01:30:28,520
Look at Aghor Sen's diary.

1254
01:30:29,279 --> 01:30:31,199
-Exactly the same drawings.
-Yes.

1255
01:30:31,279 --> 01:30:33,600
Eight Rolly-Polly dolls.

1256
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:35,520
These are called Rolly-Polly dolls?

1257
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:36,720
That's what the shop said.

1258
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:41,119
Eight Rolly-Polly dolls!

1259
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,680
Oh, that's right!
"Rolly-Polly eight little dolls."

1260
01:30:44,720 --> 01:30:45,800
Bravo!

1261
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:49,479
That sketches on the courtyard
lead to the underground chamber.

1262
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:51,640
Then let's open the underground chamber.

1263
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:54,079
We can go somewhere far away
with that sleep gadget.

1264
01:30:54,159 --> 01:30:55,760
Those goons will never find us.

1265
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:58,079
The rest of the riddle
is yet to solved.

1266
01:30:58,119 --> 01:31:00,000
"Fear not!

1267
01:31:00,079 --> 01:31:02,399
I shall bravely lay down my life--"

1268
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:03,720
Hey, no need to be shy.

1269
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:07,840
"Fear not!
I shall bravely lay down my life."

1270
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:11,399
-There he goes again.
-Subuddhi Roy has found the villain!

1271
01:31:11,439 --> 01:31:12,800
Who is this?
-Let me introduce you.

1272
01:31:13,039 --> 01:31:15,199
This is Bhabol.
He'll be Mohammad Ibaig.

1273
01:31:16,199 --> 01:31:18,279
Did you bring him from a jail?

1274
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:20,239
-Tell me something.
-Yes?

1275
01:31:20,319 --> 01:31:22,479
Did you find him at a graveyard?

1276
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:24,680
I heard murderers lurk there...

1277
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:27,520
See how I efficient I am?

1278
01:31:28,279 --> 01:31:30,680
For real, where did you find him?

1279
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:34,439
-After a long search--
-Hope he's not a real killer.

1280
01:31:34,479 --> 01:31:35,279
Of course not.

1281
01:31:35,319 --> 01:31:37,960
This has been around
since I was a kid.

1282
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:40,760
Why are you mumbling?
Speak clearly.

1283
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:42,399
He'll give a fat donation...

1284
01:31:43,479 --> 01:31:46,520
(indistinct chatter)

1285
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:48,920
I'll manage that.

1286
01:31:55,079 --> 01:31:56,199
This is a sun dial.

1287
01:31:56,199 --> 01:31:58,039
-What time is the rehearsal?
-At four p.m.

1288
01:31:58,159 --> 01:32:00,039
-He wants to know your name.
-Bhabol.

1289
01:32:00,079 --> 01:32:01,840
-Where is he?
-Hey, Bhabol.

1290
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:04,319
-Bhabol!
-Yes, that's his name.

1291
01:32:04,319 --> 01:32:09,159
You and I will rock this play!

1292
01:32:09,199 --> 01:32:12,119
I'll be Siraj and you'll be
Mohammad Ibaig. Got it?

1293
01:32:12,119 --> 01:32:14,960
The rehearsalâ€™s at four p.m.
Please be there...

1294
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,720
-Is that the instrument?
-Instrument?

1295
01:32:17,720 --> 01:32:19,000
Excuse us, please.

1296
01:32:19,199 --> 01:32:21,079
What musical instrument?

1297
01:32:21,079 --> 01:32:23,479
Let them leave, first.
Or they'll want a share...

1298
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:25,199
-I'll give you gold coins.
-Speak softly!

1299
01:32:25,279 --> 01:32:28,760
-Keto is here.
-Uncle! Bhootnath gifted me this doll.

1300
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:30,640
Hello, Bhootnath.
That's very nice.

1301
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:32,640
-Today I'm relieved...
-Found a villain?

1302
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:35,319
Oh, the best one.
Let me introduce.

1303
01:32:35,359 --> 01:32:38,319
This is Bhootnath Nandy.
And this is my nephew, Kartik Bose.

1304
01:32:38,359 --> 01:32:42,479
And this is our Mohammad Ibaig, Bhabol.

1305
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:47,479
Is he going to wear that outfit
for the play?

1306
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:49,199
So he's finally doing the part?

1307
01:32:51,039 --> 01:32:54,159
This is Subuddhi Roy for you.
A man of his words.

1308
01:32:57,479 --> 01:33:00,920
I'll kill you, you baboon!
Did you get the weapon?

1309
01:33:00,920 --> 01:33:01,960
Yes.

1310
01:33:02,319 --> 01:33:04,920
I mean, not the weapon.
But we found the house.

1311
01:33:05,119 --> 01:33:06,039
What house?

1312
01:33:06,079 --> 01:33:07,119
The one where...

1313
01:33:07,279 --> 01:33:08,720
...the uncle and nephew stay.

1314
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:11,800
-Kusum Kunj'.
-Yes, yes.

1315
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:12,760
Sure?

1316
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:14,119
Yes, sure.

1317
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:16,600
I saw that guy...

1318
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:21,279
I saw the doctor...
The scientist...

1319
01:33:21,319 --> 01:33:24,600
I saw him getting excited
about the map of that house.

1320
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:26,279
Call the over smart one!

1321
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:27,800
Here he is.

1322
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:29,720
Hey!

1323
01:33:40,439 --> 01:33:41,199
Bhootnath here.

1324
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:45,520
You'll lose your life and fame, Doc.

1325
01:33:46,479 --> 01:33:49,119
if you want to live,
hand the weapon over.

1326
01:33:50,159 --> 01:33:52,479
I'm not sitting idle.
I'm trying.

1327
01:33:53,159 --> 01:33:57,239
A big foreign client will arrive
on the next full moon day.

1328
01:33:57,319 --> 01:33:58,560
To buy this weapon.

1329
01:33:59,720 --> 01:34:01,800
I want it before that.

1330
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:08,479
You think annoying innocent people
and parading about it all over town...

1331
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:10,520
...help to get it faster?

1332
01:34:10,640 --> 01:34:14,399
I've information
that you're playing tricks...

1333
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:16,119
...on Tekka.

1334
01:34:19,279 --> 01:34:20,479
What tricks?

1335
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:21,239
Listen up.

1336
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:24,920
I know what you're up to.

1337
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:30,039
You won't get away
if you try to trick Begum.

1338
01:34:45,439 --> 01:34:48,239
Hey, Bhabol!

1339
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:54,239
Hello, Mrs. Owl
Please hoot for me once

1340
01:34:54,319 --> 01:35:00,800
Why do you moo
Like a silly cow?

1341
01:35:01,439 --> 01:35:02,439
Music instrument.

1342
01:35:02,479 --> 01:35:09,000
Hello, Mrs. Owl
Please hoot for me once

1343
01:35:09,159 --> 01:35:17,079
Why did you leave that place
And come to me?

1344
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:22,920
Okay, you've done with tea and snacks.

1345
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:26,479
Let's rehearse properly now.

1346
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:27,520
Say your lines.

1347
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:31,319
"Is what I saw the truth?
Is what I heard false?"

1348
01:35:31,439 --> 01:35:35,079
Is what I saw the truth?
Is what I heard false?

1349
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:39,319
Very nice, very nice.
Just add a little emotion.

1350
01:35:39,359 --> 01:35:42,199
Is there a problem?
Okay, wait.

1351
01:35:43,159 --> 01:35:45,119
Suppose, this is Mir Jafar.

1352
01:35:45,720 --> 01:35:48,119
You said I just need to kill someone.

1353
01:35:48,239 --> 01:35:52,760
Yes, but that's not all.
The murder is right at the end.

1354
01:35:53,199 --> 01:35:55,840
-Siraj hasn't a clue before.
-Who is Siraj?

1355
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,680
That's me.

1356
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:00,199
I want Aghor's instrument.

1357
01:36:00,239 --> 01:36:02,319
Yes, of course.

1358
01:36:02,359 --> 01:36:05,359
But let's rehearse a bit before that--

1359
01:36:05,399 --> 01:36:07,239
First the instrument,
then rehearsal.

1360
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:09,600
Oh.

1361
01:36:10,159 --> 01:36:11,840
-What a hassle--
-What did you say?

1362
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:13,039
Nothing, nothing!

1363
01:36:13,079 --> 01:36:14,399
Don't look at me like that.

1364
01:36:14,439 --> 01:36:17,880
Okay, okay.
First the instrument.

1365
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:37,119
My tenant is refusing
to leave, Gobindo.

1366
01:36:37,479 --> 01:36:40,079
I've mixed cow dung in his water.

1367
01:36:40,159 --> 01:36:43,439
Thrown rotten fruits at him.

1368
01:36:46,479 --> 01:36:48,319
Go on. I'm listening.

1369
01:36:49,039 --> 01:36:52,399
I'm making his life hell.
but he's still refuse to leave.

1370
01:36:53,199 --> 01:36:55,640
Meanwhile, haunted houses...

1371
01:36:56,319 --> 01:36:59,800
I mean, the old houses
are selling at high rates.

1372
01:37:00,079 --> 01:37:02,720
When does your tenant return home?

1373
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:05,119
In the evening.

1374
01:37:06,039 --> 01:37:10,880
After sunset, I'll give him a death stare
as he goes home.

1375
01:37:11,119 --> 01:37:12,760
Sixty bucks and twelve pennies
is my fees.

1376
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:16,199
That's too much for me... Please...

1377
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,880
If you bargain,
I'll set my eyes on you instead.

1378
01:37:19,960 --> 01:37:23,119
No need to sell haunted houses.
You'll become a ghost yourself!

1379
01:37:23,439 --> 01:37:28,520
-All hail the Lord!
-Wait...I'll pay.

1380
01:37:30,279 --> 01:37:31,520
Next client.

1381
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:49,000
Bhabol, is this really a gold coin?

1382
01:37:51,680 --> 01:37:53,319
As rich as a king!

1383
01:37:58,920 --> 01:38:00,239
Musical instrument.

1384
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:02,680
It's playing... This is it.

1385
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:06,159
Find me Aghor's instrument
and I'll give you more coins.

1386
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:07,840
More?

1387
01:38:08,359 --> 01:38:11,239
Pannalal, Chunnilal, Abirlal...

1388
01:38:11,359 --> 01:38:12,680
I'll find Aghor's for sure.

1389
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:16,199
The world is full of hope...

1390
01:38:23,680 --> 01:38:25,159
Oh, it's Kanu.

1391
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:29,560
Your niece, her husband
and their nine children...

1392
01:38:29,680 --> 01:38:34,199
have been freeloaders
for the last nine months.

1393
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:35,520
Right?

1394
01:38:36,239 --> 01:38:38,079
How did you know?

1395
01:38:38,119 --> 01:38:42,760
The savior must be aware
of those who are in danger.

1396
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:44,560
Oh!

1397
01:38:44,600 --> 01:38:46,800
They are damaging my furniture.

1398
01:38:47,359 --> 01:38:53,520
The children have destroyed my pillows.

1399
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:58,039
I'm broke.
Can't make ends meet.

1400
01:38:58,520 --> 01:39:00,840
They will leave soon.

1401
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:07,359
Pay fifty bucks
and send some milk pudding tomorrow.

1402
01:39:07,359 --> 01:39:08,439
Okay.

1403
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:11,439
Next!

1404
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:12,840
No...

1405
01:39:15,640 --> 01:39:19,319
No! Kananbala, Nanibala...
None matches his choice.

1406
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:21,720
This is too much....

1407
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:24,079
No, no. no!
It's okay, relax.

1408
01:39:24,640 --> 01:39:27,800
My nephews are stealing all my mangoes.

1409
01:39:28,359 --> 01:39:30,800
I can't even say anything
to my brother-in-law.

1410
01:39:30,920 --> 01:39:34,119
It's my third love marriage, after all.

1411
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:39,760
So if you could cause him
to hit his head...

1412
01:39:39,960 --> 01:39:42,119
-It would be great...
-Later.

1413
01:39:42,520 --> 01:39:45,840
-What about the evil eye, then?
-Need to cast it here now...

1414
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:47,199
You may leave.

1415
01:40:02,279 --> 01:40:03,720
Looking for someone?

1416
01:40:04,399 --> 01:40:05,399
No.

1417
01:40:07,159 --> 01:40:08,199
-Out for a walk.
-Oh.

1418
01:40:08,199 --> 01:40:09,600
Have a light?

1419
01:40:17,680 --> 01:40:22,000
If you look at me by chance

1420
01:40:22,039 --> 01:40:26,119
Know you brought trouble on yourself

1421
01:40:27,119 --> 01:40:28,399
Stinky old fish!

1422
01:40:28,760 --> 01:40:33,039
Then let's listen to Khan Sahib's songs?
Classics.

1423
01:40:33,119 --> 01:40:34,479
(vocalising)

1424
01:40:34,479 --> 01:40:35,760
Where is it?
Found it.

1425
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,479
You'll definitely like this.

1426
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:40,520
(vocalising)

1427
01:40:44,239 --> 01:40:45,359
Come.
Quietly.

1428
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,359
(record playing)

1429
01:41:11,279 --> 01:41:12,560
Climb fast.

1430
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:14,039
(record playing)

1431
01:41:30,039 --> 01:41:31,199
Slowly.

1432
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:33,199
(record playing)

1433
01:42:57,640 --> 01:42:59,199
Useless guy!

1434
01:42:59,199 --> 01:43:01,399
(record playing)

1435
01:43:06,920 --> 01:43:09,079
Hey. Stop.

1436
01:43:10,640 --> 01:43:15,880
"Jack and Jill went up the hill.
To fetch a pail of water.

1437
01:43:16,920 --> 01:43:21,640
Jack fell down and broke his crown.
And Jill came tumbling after."

1438
01:43:21,800 --> 01:43:23,520
(record playing)

1439
01:43:26,520 --> 01:43:27,560
Uncle!

1440
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:31,039
Keto?

1441
01:43:32,520 --> 01:43:33,600
Just a minute.

1442
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:35,800
Keto! What did you break?

1443
01:43:36,760 --> 01:43:39,000
This boy is really...
Keto!

1444
01:44:11,439 --> 01:44:12,640
Leave no witnesses.

1445
01:44:18,039 --> 01:44:19,119
Fire!

1446
01:44:26,319 --> 01:44:28,840
Oh my God!

1447
01:44:29,560 --> 01:44:31,439
Is he dead?

1448
01:44:31,960 --> 01:44:32,960
Fire!

1449
01:44:41,279 --> 01:44:42,479
Fire!

1450
01:45:13,279 --> 01:45:14,399
Can I take the boy?

1451
01:45:14,479 --> 01:45:17,560
No... Let it be... Forget it...

1452
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:25,640
Soldiers, get ready.

1453
01:45:25,640 --> 01:45:27,680
I want that weapon.

1454
01:45:29,439 --> 01:45:32,039
Arms, arms and arms

1455
01:45:32,119 --> 01:45:34,880
The only way
To get the world in your grip

1456
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:37,479
Arms, arms and arms

1457
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:40,279
The only way
To get the world in your grip

1458
01:45:40,319 --> 01:45:45,960
The round bomb, the rocket bomb
And other atomic bombs

1459
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,760
Chemical bombs
Cute little bombs

1460
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:52,399
Big, fat bombs
Small, thin bombs

1461
01:45:52,439 --> 01:45:56,479
Drop them on different lands
Every second day

1462
01:45:56,520 --> 01:45:59,119
Arms, arms and arms

1463
01:45:59,119 --> 01:46:01,880

To get the world in your grip

1464

Arms, arms and arms

1465
01:46:04,520 --> 01:46:07,319
The only way
To get the world in your grip

1466
01:46:07,359 --> 01:46:12,560
Planes, tankers, fighters
And laser guns to boot

1467
01:46:12,760 --> 01:46:15,560
Planes, tankers, fighters
And laser guns to boot

1468
01:46:15,560 --> 01:46:19,680
Let the idiots of the world
Bid their farewells

1469
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:25,000
Let loose killing weapons
All over the world

1470
01:46:25,039 --> 01:46:27,640
Arms, arms and arms

1471
01:46:27,640 --> 01:46:30,399
The only way
To get the world in your grip

1472
01:46:30,439 --> 01:46:33,000
Arms, arms and arms

1473
01:46:33,039 --> 01:46:35,800

To get the world in your grip

1474
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:38,439
Arms, arms and arms

1475
01:46:38,439 --> 01:46:41,199
The only way
To get the world in your grip

1476
01:46:41,239 --> 01:46:43,840
Arms, arms and arms

1477
01:46:43,880 --> 01:46:46,640
The only way
To get the world in your grip

Arms, arms and arms

1479
01:46:49,319 --> 01:46:52,039
The only way
To get the world in your grip

1480
01:46:55,439 --> 01:46:57,720
Don't just play violin.
Look that side.

1481
01:46:59,680 --> 01:47:02,239
Your Holiness, need me to
prompt you the hymns?

1482
01:47:03,800 --> 01:47:05,880
(indistinct chatter)

1483
01:47:17,640 --> 01:47:21,920
Lower the mic. Place it properly.
Or people won't be able to hear.

1484
01:47:22,239 --> 01:47:23,840
(indistinct chatter)

1485
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:24,520
(chanting hymns)

1486
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:34,199
(indistinct chatter)

1487
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:03,079
Rolly-Polly eight little dolls,
On sevens and fives no foot falls.

1488
01:50:03,800 --> 01:50:06,840
Rolly-Polly eight little dolls,
On sevens and fives no foot falls.

1489
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:08,680
Those who tread the middle path...

1490
01:50:11,239 --> 01:50:14,000
Rolly-Polly eight little dolls,
On sevens and fives no foot falls.

1491
01:50:14,079 --> 01:50:17,000
Those who tread the middle path
Will solve the riddle.

1492
01:50:17,039 --> 01:50:19,760
Those who tread the middle path
Will solve the riddle.

1493
01:50:22,119 --> 01:50:25,960
Here's a conch and here's a ring,
Those who seek will find the thing.

1494
01:50:27,279 --> 01:50:29,000
Step on the lotus...

1495
01:50:29,720 --> 01:50:31,520
To get to the...

1496
01:50:33,039 --> 01:50:35,359
-...the underground chamber!
-Bhootnath!

1497
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:37,960
Hey, Bhootnath!

1498
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:39,720
Bhootnath!

1499
01:50:42,279 --> 01:50:44,439
-Spaceship! A spaceship!
-Rolly-Polly eight little dolls...

1500
01:50:44,479 --> 01:50:46,399
Spaceship in Nilkuthi Forest!

1501
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:50,239
Those who tread the middle path,
Will solve the puzzle

1502
01:50:52,640 --> 01:50:54,640
-Rolly-Polly eight little dolls...
-Rolly-Polly eight little dolls...

1503
01:50:54,680 --> 01:50:56,560

1505
01:51:03,279 --> 01:51:04,840
CULTURAL FESTIVAL
BY NISCHINTIPUR SPORTING CLUB

1506
01:51:04,840 --> 01:51:06,119
Stop pushing me.

1507
01:51:26,039 --> 01:51:29,039
I've brought some sweets
and curd for you.

1508
01:51:32,159 --> 01:51:35,399
Please wreck the play.

1509
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:40,359
I refused to play Mohammad Ibaig,
so they kicked me out.

1510
01:51:40,479 --> 01:51:44,199
Let me eat the sweets first.
Then I'll think about it.

1511
01:51:44,239 --> 01:51:45,600
Make yourself scarce now.

1512
01:51:45,640 --> 01:51:47,000
Okay, good night.

1513
01:51:50,359 --> 01:51:51,640
What's your name?

1514
01:51:51,800 --> 01:51:53,560
-Kartik Bose.
-Huh?

1515
01:51:54,199 --> 01:51:55,439
The nephew?

1516
01:52:03,319 --> 01:52:05,239
Didn't go to your uncle's play?

1517
01:52:05,399 --> 01:52:06,479
No.

1518
01:52:06,840 --> 01:52:08,039
But why?

1519
01:52:08,079 --> 01:52:10,680
The whole village is there.

1520
01:52:10,840 --> 01:52:12,359
That's why we didn't go.

1521
01:52:12,520 --> 01:52:14,760
Bhootnath?
What's going on?

1522
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:17,199
We really need your help.

1523
01:52:17,479 --> 01:52:18,479
Oh...

1524
01:52:27,600 --> 01:52:30,239
"A look from me is all you need

1525
01:52:30,800 --> 01:52:33,399
To make your luck rot for sure"

1526
01:52:33,640 --> 01:52:38,920
Never thought I'd use my unlucky face
to guard an underground chamber.

1527
01:52:38,960 --> 01:52:40,600
-Bhootnath!
-Yes?

1528
01:52:40,840 --> 01:52:44,479
I brought a lantern and the iron rod.

1529
01:52:45,960 --> 01:52:50,279
Good but I can't figure out
where to start.

1530
01:52:51,560 --> 01:52:53,760
Where do we start...

1531
01:52:55,520 --> 01:52:56,640
Wait.

1532
01:52:57,359 --> 01:52:59,239
I think this says "five".

1533
01:53:00,399 --> 01:53:01,479
Yes, this is five.

1534
01:53:02,159 --> 01:53:04,880
Then where is six?

1535
01:53:06,119 --> 01:53:07,439
Here's seven.

1536
01:53:07,520 --> 01:53:09,199
-That means...
-Then this is eight.

1537
01:53:09,359 --> 01:53:10,720
-Go and stand on it.
-Yes!

1538
01:53:11,039 --> 01:53:12,359
Good evening...

1539
01:53:15,119 --> 01:53:17,279
(booing)

1540
01:53:18,760 --> 01:53:20,600
Hey! That could hurt!

1541
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:34,119
Wasted my whole life
casting evil an eye.

1542
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:36,079
Good God...

1543
01:53:37,279 --> 01:53:38,319
Let's start.

1544
01:53:38,760 --> 01:53:41,159
"Rolly-Polly eight..."
Step on it.

1545
01:53:41,199 --> 01:53:43,640
"Rolly-Polly eight little dolls,
On sevens and fives no foot falls."

1546
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:44,920
Don't step on seven!

1547
01:53:45,439 --> 01:53:47,000
"On sevens and fives no foot falls."

1548
01:53:47,079 --> 01:53:48,600
"Those who tread the middle path...

1549
01:53:49,079 --> 01:53:50,680
Will solve the riddle"
Step there.

1550
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:52,079
"Here's a conch..."
There it is.

1551
01:53:52,079 --> 01:53:53,279
Wait, I'll help you.

1552
01:53:53,880 --> 01:53:57,119
Conch and the ring...
Step there.

1553
01:53:57,439 --> 01:54:01,720
"Here's a conch and here's a ring,
those who seek will find the thing."

1554
01:54:02,079 --> 01:54:03,800
The lotus is here...
Wait! Stop!

1555
01:54:03,800 --> 01:54:06,279
Let's do it again from the beginning.
Go back.

1556
01:54:06,319 --> 01:54:07,560
Remember how to do it?

1557
01:54:11,199 --> 01:54:15,199
Bhoja's announcing
is just waste of time.

1558
01:54:15,239 --> 01:54:16,399
-Why?
-He's worthless!

1559
01:54:16,399 --> 01:54:18,239
-Calm down.
-Everything will work out.

1560
01:54:18,279 --> 01:54:20,600
Your Mohammad Ibaig
is not going to come.

1561
01:54:20,680 --> 01:54:24,479
But this morning he promised
to come by four p.m.

1562
01:54:24,520 --> 01:54:27,279
I told you many times
to give me the role of Krishna.

1563
01:54:27,319 --> 01:54:29,359
-Don't get so agitated.
-Told you not to take him!

1564
01:54:29,399 --> 01:54:31,439
-Can't over-rule your luck.
-Shut up, idiot!

1565
01:54:31,479 --> 01:54:33,399
I told you not to take strangers.

1566
01:54:34,680 --> 01:54:36,000
That man...

1567
01:54:36,479 --> 01:54:39,159
He's always eating sweets.

1568
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:42,640
What will happen to my kingdom...
I mean, my play?

1569
01:54:42,640 --> 01:54:45,359
It'll go down the drain!

1570
01:54:45,399 --> 01:54:48,359
The audience will throw shoes at us!

1571
01:54:48,439 --> 01:54:50,720
And rotten eggs!

1572
01:54:50,840 --> 01:54:53,720
Poritosh! You are Mohammad Ibaig!

1573
01:54:53,840 --> 01:54:57,000
-What? He?
-Is this a joke?

1574
01:54:57,039 --> 01:54:59,199
You know the play by heart.

1575
01:54:59,279 --> 01:55:01,399
But then who will prompt?

1576
01:55:01,439 --> 01:55:03,479
Moreover, I'm blind without my glasses.

1577
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:07,680
Listen, I'll give you two gold coins.
I'll wrap you in gold!

1578
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,319
Giggling like a child.

1579
01:55:19,039 --> 01:55:22,039
That man playing the king...

1580
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,439
I was supposed to kill him.

1581
01:55:25,520 --> 01:55:28,039
You still have to finish the game.

1582
01:55:28,279 --> 01:55:30,600
Why?
I've already ruined the play.

1583
01:55:31,199 --> 01:55:33,680
Constantly nagging me!

1584
01:55:33,720 --> 01:55:36,560
The real play is going on
in the underground chamber.

1585
01:55:37,119 --> 01:55:41,800
That old man put a slab
on top of the underground chamber.

1586
01:55:42,159 --> 01:55:44,000
None can lift it.

1587
01:55:44,039 --> 01:55:46,520
Just because you couldn't,
doesn't mean no one can.

1588
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:49,960
-"Rolly-Polly eight little dolls..."
-Yes.

1589
01:55:50,319 --> 01:55:52,239
"On sevens and fives no foot falls."
"On sevens and fives no foot falls."

1590
01:55:52,279 --> 01:55:54,239
"Those who tread the middle path..."
"Those who tread the middle path..."

1591
01:55:54,279 --> 01:55:55,920
"Will solve the puzzle."
"Will solve the puzzle."

1592
01:55:55,960 --> 01:55:59,600
-"Here's a conch and here's a ring..."
-"Here's a conch and here's a ring..."

1593
01:55:59,920 --> 01:56:02,520
-"Those who seek will find the thing."
-"Those who seek will find the thing."

1594
01:56:02,600 --> 01:56:04,720
-"Step on the lotus..."
-"Step on the lotus..."

1595
01:56:06,680 --> 01:56:09,279
-"To get to the underground chamber."
-"To get to the underground chamber."

1596
01:56:31,640 --> 01:56:33,880
Why are you nagging me?

1597
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:35,680
What's the matter?

1598
01:56:35,840 --> 01:56:39,920
Look who's there
in the underground chamber.

1599
01:56:40,600 --> 01:56:41,720
Take a look.

1600
01:56:48,479 --> 01:56:50,239
And the gadget?

1601
01:56:50,479 --> 01:56:52,600
Finders keepers.

1602
01:56:53,079 --> 01:56:57,159
Remember, a cool head will always wins.

1603
01:56:57,319 --> 01:57:00,000
Use your vanishing gun carefully.

1604
01:57:01,560 --> 01:57:05,359
Be careful of that
scientist's side-kick.

1605
01:57:05,479 --> 01:57:06,960
He is dangerous.

1606
01:57:39,560 --> 01:57:41,039
What's this, Bhootnath?

1607
01:57:42,199 --> 01:57:43,880
I think this is...

1608
01:57:44,760 --> 01:57:46,319
Aghor Sen's device
for electricity.

1609
01:57:54,319 --> 01:57:55,640
Switch it on.

1610
01:58:02,920 --> 01:58:04,840
Nothing happened...

1611
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:06,079
Wait.

1612
01:58:06,520 --> 01:58:07,520
Now try.

1613
01:58:20,840 --> 01:58:22,000
Bhootnath!

1614
01:59:27,840 --> 01:59:29,479
That sleep machine.

1615
01:59:31,239 --> 01:59:33,880
There he is!
The ghost-doctor.

1616
01:59:39,640 --> 01:59:42,239
Come out! Come out!

1617
01:59:51,520 --> 01:59:52,720
Doctor!

1618
01:59:56,119 --> 01:59:57,800
Doctor.

1619
01:59:59,039 --> 02:00:04,000
If you want to live,
come out with that weapon.

1620
02:00:06,720 --> 02:00:09,319
-Come out with the weapon.
-Do it.

1621
02:00:09,399 --> 02:00:12,840
Bhootnath, what if this tarnishes
your reputation?

1622
02:00:12,840 --> 02:00:14,520
-Doctor!
-Let them do whatever they want.

1623
02:00:14,520 --> 02:00:16,800
-Don't try to act smart.
-Be quiet.

1624
02:00:17,159 --> 02:00:20,680
Or you'll die a cruel death.

1625
02:00:24,600 --> 02:00:26,119
Doctor!

1626
02:00:29,039 --> 02:00:30,039
Let go.

1627
02:00:31,079 --> 02:00:32,600
Doctor!

1628
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:34,800
Come on out.

1629
02:00:40,560 --> 02:00:42,159
There he is.

1630
02:00:42,520 --> 02:00:44,960
I see the vermin right there.

1631
02:00:53,439 --> 02:00:54,640
The ghost-doctor.

1632
02:00:56,199 --> 02:00:58,199
Keep the weapon on the ground.

1633
02:01:06,640 --> 02:01:07,720
Step back.

1634
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:13,319
He is very disobedient.

1635
02:01:13,920 --> 02:01:16,359
First let Kartik go.
Then you will get the gadget.

1636
02:01:16,560 --> 02:01:18,600
-You brat!
-Let Kartik go.

1637
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:25,840
Kill him.

1638
02:01:27,680 --> 02:01:29,359
This is where the story ends.

1639
02:01:31,159 --> 02:01:32,520
Your time...

1640
02:01:35,079 --> 02:01:36,159
...is up.

1641
02:01:42,279 --> 02:01:43,720
So sad.

1642
02:01:47,640 --> 02:01:49,439
Hey, what are you doing?

1643
02:01:50,800 --> 02:01:52,680
-Catch that boy!
-Get him!

1644
02:01:52,720 --> 02:01:56,000
-He's escaping! Catch him!
-Let him go!

1645
02:01:58,399 --> 02:02:00,720
Now you face the music.

1646
02:02:00,800 --> 02:02:02,119
Let him go!

1647
02:02:02,479 --> 02:02:03,720
Please!

1648
02:02:03,920 --> 02:02:05,560
-Let him go--
-What the hell?

1649
02:02:05,840 --> 02:02:07,199
Who's there?

1650
02:02:07,279 --> 02:02:10,199
-What happened?
-Ghost-doctor, come here!

1651
02:02:10,239 --> 02:02:13,319
-Ghost! A ghost!
-Find him!

1652
02:02:13,359 --> 02:02:15,439
I found him!

1653
02:02:16,359 --> 02:02:18,079
You jack**!

1654
02:02:19,199 --> 02:02:20,920
Power cut again?

1655
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:25,159
Found him!
I got him this time!

1656
02:02:28,279 --> 02:02:31,000
Where are the soldiers?
Come here right now!

1657
02:02:31,039 --> 02:02:34,119
Found him!

1658
02:02:37,319 --> 02:02:38,960
When did you come?
I have no weapon.

1659
02:02:39,760 --> 02:02:40,880
Who is this?

1660
02:02:41,680 --> 02:02:43,079
Where is my soldiers?

1661
02:02:43,199 --> 02:02:45,399
They've all vanished.

1662
02:03:02,039 --> 02:03:04,479
Will you sell this weapon?

1663
02:03:08,319 --> 02:03:10,680
In exchange for the musical weapon.

1664
02:03:13,680 --> 02:03:15,399
You won't sell it?

1665
02:03:21,600 --> 02:03:23,640
Blow him up!

1666
02:03:42,439 --> 02:03:44,039
You filthy punk!

1667
02:03:49,960 --> 02:03:51,159
Bhootnath!

1668
02:03:52,399 --> 02:03:54,840
Use the gadget!

1669
02:03:59,960 --> 02:04:02,279
Bhootnath, use the device.

1670
02:04:04,279 --> 02:04:05,319
Bhootnath...

1671
02:04:05,960 --> 02:04:07,840
That's mine.

1672
02:04:14,960 --> 02:04:16,239
Bhootnath.

1673
02:04:17,680 --> 02:04:19,199
Switch on the gadget.

1674
02:04:38,439 --> 02:04:41,119
(chanting)

1675
02:04:56,159 --> 02:04:57,399
Bhootnath!

1676
02:05:07,920 --> 02:05:08,960
Bhootnath?

1677
02:05:12,800 --> 02:05:15,520
Hey, Bhootnath?
Are you okay?

1678
02:05:17,039 --> 02:05:18,119
I'm fine.

1679
02:05:18,920 --> 02:05:22,359
Go check on Gobindo.

1680
02:05:22,800 --> 02:05:25,560
He's alone up there.
Go, hurry.

1681
02:05:31,399 --> 02:05:33,239
I'll be back in a jiffy.

1682
02:05:50,840 --> 02:05:53,239
No point crying over it.

1683
02:05:54,960 --> 02:05:56,119
This...

1684
02:05:57,720 --> 02:05:58,880
This broke.

1685
02:06:00,840 --> 02:06:02,960
It just slipped out of my hand.

1686
02:06:04,119 --> 02:06:06,880
Good riddance.

1687
02:06:09,520 --> 02:06:11,520
But what about Vik?

1688
02:06:14,840 --> 02:06:17,439
Don't keep this trash
on Earth anymore.

1689
02:06:19,399 --> 02:06:20,560
It won't do any good.

1690
02:06:25,119 --> 02:06:27,000
Take him and come with me.

1691
02:06:54,399 --> 02:06:56,039
What are you wondering?

1692
02:06:56,960 --> 02:07:01,760
Archimedes, Galileo, Newton...

1693
02:07:05,640 --> 02:07:07,760
Don't you want to see the Milky Way?

1694
02:07:20,880 --> 02:07:23,640
(radio frequency)

1695
02:08:00,319 --> 02:08:01,840
(indistinct radio frequency)

1696
02:08:03,640 --> 02:08:04,720
Kartik?

1697
02:08:07,960 --> 02:08:09,039
Hey?

1698
02:08:13,479 --> 02:08:14,479
Kartik...

1699
02:08:16,319 --> 02:08:17,960
This is Bhootnath.

1700
02:08:20,239 --> 02:08:21,319
Kartik?

1701
02:08:24,399 --> 02:08:25,399
Kartik.

1702
02:08:25,760 --> 02:08:29,239
Bhootnath, It's me, Kartik.
Can you hear me?

1703
02:08:29,399 --> 02:08:30,520
Yes.

1704
02:08:31,279 --> 02:08:32,479
Where are you?

1705
02:08:34,600 --> 02:08:35,600
Bhootnath?

1706
02:08:35,760 --> 02:08:36,880
I am in space.

1707
02:08:39,880 --> 02:08:40,920
In space?

1708
02:08:41,720 --> 02:08:43,960
I'm traveling to Nyapcha
in Vik's spaceship.

1709
02:08:45,279 --> 02:08:46,239
And Vik?

1710
02:08:46,279 --> 02:08:47,319
He's with me.

1711
02:08:47,640 --> 02:08:49,159
Sleeping soundly.

1712
02:08:55,960 --> 02:08:57,119
Kartik.

1713
02:08:58,319 --> 02:08:59,600
How is Gobindo?

1714
02:09:02,039 --> 02:09:03,680
Hope he isn't hurt.

1715
02:09:06,199 --> 02:09:07,279
Kartik?

1716
02:09:08,079 --> 02:09:09,319
Can you hear me?

1717
02:09:09,880 --> 02:09:11,159
What about your uncle?

1718
02:09:13,199 --> 02:09:15,880
Hey, why aren't you responding?

1719
02:09:15,880 --> 02:09:16,960
Kartik?

1720
02:09:17,680 --> 02:09:18,760
Kartik?

1721
02:09:20,239 --> 02:09:24,159
You left me without telling.

1722
02:09:24,399 --> 02:09:25,920
It feels amazing here.

1723
02:09:27,239 --> 02:09:29,000
An endless black expanse...

1724
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:31,640
...with silver shinning through.

1725
02:09:33,039 --> 02:09:37,399
From here, Earth appears
even smaller than your toy car.

1726
02:09:38,640 --> 02:09:40,079
I'm mesmerized.

1727
02:09:40,960 --> 02:09:42,079
Entranced.

1728
02:09:43,520 --> 02:09:45,399
Why didn't you take the gadget?

1729
02:09:46,520 --> 02:09:48,239
Throw it away.

1730
02:09:51,920 --> 02:09:53,000
Why?

1731
02:09:54,680 --> 02:09:58,399
Man still hasn't learnt to use...

1732
02:09:59,079 --> 02:10:01,800
scientific inventions for
their true purpose.

1733
02:10:02,039 --> 02:10:05,880
You saw how they tried to use it
like a weapon.

1734
02:10:07,479 --> 02:10:09,199
No one bothered to understand...

1735
02:10:10,039 --> 02:10:11,560
...it's true potential.

1736
02:10:15,279 --> 02:10:18,239
I've been wanting to tell you, Kartik.

1737
02:10:18,920 --> 02:10:21,159
Science is....

1738
02:10:25,359 --> 02:10:27,920
Bhootnath? Bhootnath!

1739
02:10:30,039 --> 02:10:31,079
Bhootnath?

1740
02:10:57,840 --> 02:11:00,399
Maybe there's a lot more
in that underground chamber.

1741
02:11:01,439 --> 02:11:02,680
Diaries...

1742
02:11:03,560 --> 02:11:04,800
More gadgets...

1743
02:11:05,800 --> 02:11:07,279
Incomplete inventions...

1744
02:11:09,600 --> 02:11:10,840
Look for them.

1745
02:11:12,079 --> 02:11:13,199
I'm sure you'll find them.

1746
02:11:15,439 --> 02:11:19,039
But this search must only be
for the joy of discovery.

1747
02:11:20,439 --> 02:11:25,800
Nothing brings more happiness.

1748
02:11:29,479 --> 02:11:30,800
I know, you can do it.

1749
02:11:32,640 --> 02:11:36,800
Remember, I'm there for you.

1750
02:11:37,680 --> 02:11:39,279
I'll always be with you.

1751
02:11:43,119 --> 02:11:46,199
(song playing)
