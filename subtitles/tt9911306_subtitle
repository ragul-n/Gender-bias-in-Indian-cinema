1
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,583
Look..SK Sir.. 
Good morning

2
00:06:04,792 --> 00:06:09,333
Sir..Where are you going in a hurry? 
To the class?

3
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,000
No.. Going to the toilet..Coming with me?

4
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,458
What is the dirty stench?

5
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,417
He just left some gas..

6
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:16,917
But, why does it smell like ganja?

7
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:23,000
He is like that Sir.. 
Sometimes it smells like ganja and sometimes liquor

8
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,000
Sometimes, it could be just that of toddy..

9
00:06:25,167 --> 00:06:26,708
-And sometimes..-Enough...

10
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:32,875
Very good..What wisdom!! 
And what a knowledge about gases..!!

11
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,000
I know what to do with you all...

12
00:06:41,792 --> 00:06:43,792
-Write fast. Sir is coming 
-Ok

13
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,125
Your handwriting is very good

14
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:51,708
Where did we stop yesterday?

15
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:56,208
Clean development management

16
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,708
-What is it... early in the morning? 
-There is a circular

17
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,500
This is an awareness circular

18
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:24,250
For the attention of students.. 
Drugs are cancer cells that kill the society..

19
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,500
And it is the duty of the society to defend it

20
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:31,417
The number of people who get attracted to it,

21
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,875
and end up 
in a miserable and painful life, 
 are increasing day by day..

22
00:07:35,417 --> 00:07:43,792
In India, Kerala has become second only 
to Amritsar in reported cases of drug abuse..

23
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:51,833
In 2017 only, drugs worth 304 crores 
were confiscated from 50000 cases!!

24
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:54,750
And unknown cases may be still more

25
00:07:55,208 --> 00:08:01,417
Terminal punishment could be given to those who

26
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:04,292
are caught and punished for drug abuse, a second time

27
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,417
It is the duty of every citizen who loves our country

28
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:15,292
... to inform the police if they get to know of drug peddling

29
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,375
Ok

30
00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:22,500
Just to tell you all something.

31
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,000
Be careful now .. you won't be sorry in future..

32
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,000
Have you all updated your notes?

33
00:08:40,292 --> 00:08:43,333
You are smart!! How could you do this?

34
00:08:43,917 --> 00:08:48,417
Different pages..different handwritings!!

35
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:52,417
This is a rare talent ,some people attain!!

36
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:54,667
Handwriting changes everyday!!

37
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,917
You are a wonder-kid!!

38
00:08:57,208 --> 00:09:00,125
Tell me frankly..Whose handwriting is this?

39
00:09:00,417 --> 00:09:02,292
Truly..I don't remember Sir

40
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,792
Quite natural!!

41
00:09:06,417 --> 00:09:09,542
One gets confused with different pages!!

42
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:13,500
Tell me ..Otherwise, I will find out..

43
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,500
Then,you will get it from me.

44
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Tell me..Whose is this?

45
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:22,417
And then..Whose is this?

46
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:27,583
What about this?

47
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:33,458
Your notebook doesn't have your handwriting?

48
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:34,708
-Yes sir.. 
-Where is it?

49
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:42,417
Here. Sir

50
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,208
At last, he saw his own handwriting in his own note book!!

51
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:53,708
Just half a page

52
00:09:54,417 --> 00:09:58,000
That too, like some doctor's prescription

53
00:09:58,708 --> 00:09:59,583
What is it..Dude?

54
00:10:00,292 --> 00:10:02,542
You were destined to become a doctor, Is it?

55
00:10:07,292 --> 00:10:09,333
Our folks are fortunate enough!

56
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:14,250
You know how many lives you saved 
by not becoming a doctor?

57
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,583
Sir..Since long, many of his notes are written by us..

58
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,250
-So..you know him since long? 
-Yes Sir

59
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:23,000
We six were together from the lower KG itself

60
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,500
Six? Who are all they?

61
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:27,542
We all, Sir

62
00:10:32,542 --> 00:10:35,583
Sir..He is more interested in arts and sports..

63
00:10:35,917 --> 00:10:37,000
He is the house captain too

64
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:38,667
He is crazy about movies as well..

65
00:10:38,917 --> 00:10:39,583
Oh..That too??

66
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:44,500
Yes Sir..We acted together in two films..

67
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:45,500
Which ones?

68
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:46,833
Anandabhairavi and Athisayam

69
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,208
Teachers give him charge for all the programmes

70
00:10:49,417 --> 00:10:50,792
So that their efforts is less

71
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:52,708
Then... How does he get time to write notes?

72
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,917
Ok..Got it..But I have a doubt

73
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,542
Then, who writes the exam?

74
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,292
He writes himself..and passes

75
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:05,583
How do you pass?...Tell me 
What is the secret?

76
00:11:05,792 --> 00:11:12,000
No secret Sir.. 
He learns in half an hour that 
I take six hours to learn

77
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,458
That is the secret

78
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:19,208
But, Anand, if you have to improve your handwriting, 
you have to write

79
00:11:20,292 --> 00:11:23,792
So, from tomorrow onwards, show me your notes..

80
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,292
In your own handwriting

81
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,208
Listen to me

82
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,625
What are you doing? This is no time for pranks..

83
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:52,500
Move aside

84
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:54,708
I will spank you..Move aside

85
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,750
You come here

86
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,708
Move aside You come here

87
00:12:04,417 --> 00:12:05,500
Listen to the mudras..

88
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,375
Very good..

89
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,708
Who are you to take photographs? Get out

90
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:35,208
Taking photographs of girls 
to spoil the event!!Idiot!!

91
00:12:38,667 --> 00:12:39,708
So you was sitting here!

92
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,125
-What happened to you? 
-Bullshit!!

93
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:49,917
Don't get angry..Tell me what happened?

94
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,625
You are so happy when Aysha took my place ..Is it?

95
00:12:52,792 --> 00:12:57,333
I am happy whoever it is.. you, Aysha or anyone else

96
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,208
Oh..How many are there to make you happy?!

97
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,708
Have you gone crazy?

98
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,375
How does it matter to you with whomever I dance?

99
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:10,000
You are right..

100
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,333
Why should I get tensed if you dance with anyone?

101
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:16,458
I am observing a change in you since some days..

102
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,333
I got out of mood, somehow

103
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:37,083
Bawa..

104
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:41,875
What is it ,Grandpa?

105
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:43,292
Did you see this?

106
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:44,583
Do you know him?

107
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,708
Who is this guy?

108
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,625

Who is he?

111
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,833
I know him quite well..

112
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,500
I have seen him somewhere

113
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:04,917
My God..I can't recollect!!

114
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:08,417
Yes..Got it.. grandpa..Athisayan

115
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,750
I know him since long..He is too smart!

116
00:14:20,917 --> 00:14:21,625
How do you know him?

117
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:25,000
We acted in a movie together 
before I went for Haj.

118
00:14:25,167 --> 00:14:26,125
Athisayan

119
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,583
During the shooting, 
he used to go and sit next to her

120
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,792
After every shot, goes and sits next to Aysha

121
00:14:32,917 --> 00:14:33,417
Why?

122
00:14:33,542 --> 00:14:35,708
To exchange sweet nothings..What else?

123
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,250
Is it true ..My Lord!

124
00:14:38,292 --> 00:14:43,667
Yes..Grandpa..He is not just a lad..He is terrible

125
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,750
How terrible?

126
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:49,583
A romantic terrorist.... 
Be careful or she will elope with him

127
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,708
What..

128
00:14:50,917 --> 00:14:52,083
Yes..Our Aysha

129
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:55,792
Oh...My Lord.. Will it be an issue?

130
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:05,208
Greetings

131
00:15:05,417 --> 00:15:06,250
How are things?

132
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:08,000
-Everything going on fine.. 
-Really?

133
00:15:08,042 --> 00:15:08,875
Come

134
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:12,208
Hydros..

135
00:15:12,542 --> 00:15:13,792
What is it, Papa?

136
00:15:15,917 --> 00:15:17,083
Did you see this?

137
00:15:23,792 --> 00:15:26,083
-All of you stay outside-Okay

138
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,625
What is all this,Papa?

139
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:34,917
This was sent by Aflan, son of Mehroob

140
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:38,500
Who is this guy?

141
00:15:38,792 --> 00:15:45,167
Son of S I Rajmohan, who lost 
his legs in a bike accident

142
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:45,833
Bawa..

143
00:15:46,917 --> 00:15:47,875
Did Aysha come back from college?

144
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:52,083
-Yes 
-Call her

145
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:54,417
Aysha

146
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,917
What is it, Papa?

147
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,375
What am I seeing here?

148
00:16:01,667 --> 00:16:04,042
Oh..This one..How did you get this?

149
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,167
These are Onam celebrations rehearsal photographs...

150
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,167
Who told you to remove the veil?

151
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:12,333
My Grandpa..The veil doesn't match 
with our Kerala attire

152
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:14,750
Answer the question..

153
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:19,250
Noone told me Papa..I did it myself

154
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,708
You are not a little girl now..

155
00:16:23,167 --> 00:16:25,333
Not only that..You know who you are?

156
00:16:25,667 --> 00:16:28,500
You are the granddaughter of Veliyitath Ummer haji

157
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,500
Don't let it grow into a scandal

158
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:34,000
From tomorrow onwards..wear 
a purdah when going to college

159
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,042
It is pitiable..Grandpa

160
00:16:36,042 --> 00:16:39,500
College is not air condititoned.. 
I will get scorched in heat..

161
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,292
Grandpa will tell...and my darling will obey..

162
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,500
Papa..er..

163
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,333
Don't answer me back..Go..

164
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:50,333
What a pity!!

165
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,292
Each day's quarrels should be settled on that day itself. 
Haven't I told you?

166
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,833
That is over

167
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,417
He came to me.I got wild and 
told him things frankly..Openly

168
00:17:04,917 --> 00:17:08,417
I feel like seeing him always ..only him

169
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:15,833
Even when I look at the book or the blackboard... 
... his face is what comes to me..

170
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:19,000
His smile, his mannerisms

171
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:24,500
Enough..This is the beginning of romance.. I am sure..

172
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:27,708
I used to have this long ago..With your father

173
00:17:27,917 --> 00:17:29,500
Correct..You said it

174
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:34,833
Then, what is your opinion if 
I fall in love with him and marry him?

175
00:17:34,917 --> 00:17:37,167
Did he say that he loved you?

176
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:41,917
No..That is not a problem..I will make him say that

177
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:44,833
Is he attached to someone else?

178
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:49,208
No..I am sure

179
00:17:50,542 --> 00:17:53,500
Mummy..You didn't say anything

180
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:57,167
Whatever..I think it is not good

181
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,917
Why not?

182
00:18:00,167 --> 00:18:03,292
If couples of same age get married,

183
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,792
..there could be issues after some years..

184
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,042
What sort of an issue?

185
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:12,875
By the time girls attain 45 years

186
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:17,333
.. they start losing charm.. 
due to child birth and all that

187
00:18:17,792 --> 00:18:23,667
And men even at 45, look really smart and glamorous..

188
00:18:24,292 --> 00:18:25,292
And then sometimes?

189
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:26,792
Sometimes?

190
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:28,375
They might jump over the fence..

191
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:35,292
In my opinion, there should be an 
age difference of at least ten years

192
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:42,458
So..Mummy says Anand might go with some other girls 
.. after some years..Is it?

193
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:48,042
I didn't say that..But there is a possibility

194
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:52,125
He won't do that

195
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:58,625
And if he does that, I will 
chop off his genital and feed dogs..

196
00:19:03,417 --> 00:19:05,917
Now you became totally crazy..

197
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:07,542
You got crazy..not me

198
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:14,833
What sort of nonsense you are belching out??

199
00:19:16,417 --> 00:19:19,667
That is the recent trend, Dear

200
00:19:20,167 --> 00:19:21,542
Don't you read newspapers?

201
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:24,917
There would be at least one news 
... about someone's genitals getting cut

202
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,167
Girl friend does this to boy friend..

203
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:28,625
Wife on her husband

204
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:30,250
A young woman doing it on a swamy

205
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,875
Employee on employer's

206
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,667
Last day..in Kuttipuram...Stop..

207
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:38,750
Don't you read anything else in newspapers?

208
00:19:47,417 --> 00:19:52,542
Here is she!!!..Looks like P T Usha arriving..

209
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,208
I was a state athlete..

210
00:19:55,542 --> 00:19:57,167
You sure look like that..

211
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:58,458
Aysha ,Just a sec..

212
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:09,167
You look beautiful in the Purdah

213
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:13,625
I can see a lot of kafirs flying around you

214
00:20:14,167 --> 00:20:16,208
Don't be friendly with them..it will create problems

215
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,458
You have friends from our folk..then what? Look here

216
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,625
I can do anything for you.. 
In one way, you are customarily my bride...

217
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:25,583
What do I lack?

218
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,167
You neeed some thrashes..Do you want?

219
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,125
What a great joke!!.. 
You are a great humourist...since long!!

220
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:33,750
Not a joke..

221
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,667
I am very serious..Listen

222
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,458
I am not a new born baby..

223
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:42,125
I know what is right and what is wrong

224
00:20:42,417 --> 00:20:43,917
I don't need your study classes

225
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:50,500
And..If you try to harasss me, 
I will hit you back...Idiot..

226
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:57,125
How was my performance?

227
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,833
You are like a cheetah... 
Fried him ..Right?

228
00:21:01,417 --> 00:21:02,583
Where is Lakshmi?

229
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,250
She was right here..

230
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:15,583
Aysha is my friend..If she asks me, I will do it..

231
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:23,708
Lakshmi..An Iyer girl from Palakkat..Understand..

232
00:21:31,042 --> 00:21:32,375
What is the problem?

233
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,333
So you thrashed him without an issue?

234
00:21:34,917 --> 00:21:38,125
She is my friend..When I knew that he troubled her

235
00:21:38,292 --> 00:21:40,917
I gave him whatever he needed

236
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,125
I can wait to know about the issue..

237
00:21:43,167 --> 00:21:44,708
Tell me..What was the issue..

238
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:46,500
He is related to her..

239
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:50,542
Relative or not..these things require immediate retort

240
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:51,750
You are too good..

241
00:21:52,292 --> 00:21:53,500
Let me get my bag

242
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,833
Is she a female?

243
00:21:59,292 --> 00:22:00,833
Yes..I am sure

244
00:22:01,042 --> 00:22:02,292
How do you know that?

245
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:06,000
I too had a doubt. 
But confirmed it in the bathroom

246
00:22:06,917 --> 00:22:08,750
Too smart!!

247
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:13,250
-What is the problem? Tell me. 
It is time for class

248
00:22:13,292 --> 00:22:14,833
Come. I will tell you

249
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:18,042
Look..I like you

250
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:21,250
You start liking me only now? 
I like you from lower KG itself.

251
00:22:22,292 --> 00:22:25,208
Not that, Dude....This is another sort of liking

252
00:22:29,042 --> 00:22:31,542
You think you are in love with me?

253
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:37,625
Shall we think seriously about our marriage?

254
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,042
Tell me frankly..Don't you love me?

255
00:22:41,292 --> 00:22:44,042
I am beautiful.. 
Do you have any doubts about that?

256
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:45,250
You have gone nuts..!

257
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,125
I have no cash even to buy petrol. 
....and should I think about marriage!!?

258
00:22:49,292 --> 00:22:50,458
I am going to the class

259
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,458
I didn't want to make you cry..

260
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,667
I just can't think of a marriage 
or even being in love

261
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:33,125
I have to finish my course ..then get a job

262
00:23:33,417 --> 00:23:35,458
Then only I can repay the housing loan

263
00:23:36,042 --> 00:23:40,708
Dummy legs for my Dad..I have no other dreams

264
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:49,833
When we were small, your mom used to tell my mom

265
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:56,125
That when she grows up, give her to us. 
Myself and Anand will look after her well

266
00:23:57,667 --> 00:24:00,500
If your mother were alive today... 
I wouldn't have been in this pathetic situation..

267
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:08,792
Now I understand that you 
are getting away from me..

268
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:13,375
I want to know why...Tell me

269
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:17,750
I am a little darker than you, Is it?

270
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:18,625
Nope...

271
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:22,042
Then?. I am not as tall as you? 
 6ft1 inch? Right?

272
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:25,542
If you were 6ft 1 in.. 
You would have been looking gorgeous!!!

273
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:27,500
Like a giraffe!!

274
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:33,750
Tell me frankly... 
Are you in love with someone else?

275
00:24:33,917 --> 00:24:35,458
If so?

276
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,875
I wil kill her

277
00:24:37,917 --> 00:24:39,042
What did you say?

278
00:24:39,667 --> 00:24:42,042
I will kill her... for sure

279
00:24:42,917 --> 00:24:43,667
Now I am sure..

280
00:24:43,833 --> 00:24:45,375
That I am crazy?

281
00:24:46,542 --> 00:24:47,917
You better understand that

282
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:53,042
Anand..Are you not attending the class?

283
00:24:53,417 --> 00:24:55,167
Yes sir..You go ahead, Sir

284
00:24:55,542 --> 00:24:56,792
What is your programme?

285
00:24:57,333 --> 00:25:00,375
We were just discussing about new software

286
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:02,833
I got it when she opened her eyes...

287
00:25:03,042 --> 00:25:04,292
First, try to pass the exam..Dude

288
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,542
You are happy now, right?

289
00:25:11,458 --> 00:25:12,250
What is that now?

290
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,167
First ..You try to learn how to kill a cockroach..

291
00:25:21,417 --> 00:25:22,208
Everything can come later

292
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,208
How smart these guys are!!!

293
00:25:39,042 --> 00:25:40,625
You will spoil my reputation ..Is it?

294
00:25:56,917 --> 00:26:01,208
Anand..

295
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,375
Where did he go?

296
00:26:03,708 --> 00:26:07,000
He left about ten minutes back. 
Seems there is a special class today

297
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:08,167
He left without telling me..?

298
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:13,250
I said I would call you.. 
Then he said not to disturb you..

299
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:17,208
Let dad sing a bathroom song and shit..

300
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,167
Time went fast reading the newspaper

301
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:23,625
I need a kiss from him to 
become smart in the morning

302
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:25,792
Did you get?

303
00:26:26,542 --> 00:26:30,917
I got two..Then he said, give one to Dad

304
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,208
Then don't be late..Give me..

305
00:26:37,167 --> 00:26:39,542
Now..One from you..

306
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:58,083
Only just two...I am getting a pouch

307
00:26:59,625 --> 00:27:01,917
Don't run away after breakfast.. 
I am coming with you

308
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:03,292
To the market

309
00:27:03,625 --> 00:27:06,250
Get ready fast..As it is, I am late..

310
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:17,875
What is it?

311
00:27:37,875 --> 00:27:40,792
-Savitri.... 
-I am just coming

312
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:23,458
If I were late for five mins, 
the medical shop would have closed

313
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,917
Both of us forgot that the tablets were over..

314
00:28:33,458 --> 00:28:34,667
You feeling sleepy ,Dad?

315
00:28:56,917 --> 00:29:00,583
Thampi Sir is out of mood today!! 
What happened?

316
00:29:13,625 --> 00:29:15,333
Prasad,the bank manager, had called today

317
00:29:16,208 --> 00:29:20,750
He is helpless if the housing 
loan file goes to the Head Office

318
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:24,042
He respects you quite a lot..

319
00:29:24,917 --> 00:29:26,583
So..He said to me frankly..

320
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:29,625
If we can pay some amount to 
keep the loan account live....

321
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:33,583
....he can get the attachment 
delayed for some more time

322
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:38,458
What is left of Mummy's gold ornaments now?

323
00:29:39,667 --> 00:29:41,542
Two bangles and the wedding chain

324
00:29:42,542 --> 00:29:46,167
Sell one bangle, keep some money for our expenses

325
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,458
The balance amount, you pay the bank..

326
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:08,333
What happened to you today, Dad?

327
00:30:14,708 --> 00:30:16,500
-Mummy came into your memory?-Hmm

328
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,125
What a cursed destiny we have, Dad!!

329
00:30:24,583 --> 00:30:26,042
Even now, you don't suspect anyone?

330
00:30:27,875 --> 00:30:31,833
All criminals were my enemies when I was in service

331
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:34,708
Out of them, whom can I suspect?

332
00:30:36,333 --> 00:30:39,500
Even now, I can't believe it was an ordinary accident

333
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:43,625
I will grieve till I get at the truth..

334
00:30:45,792 --> 00:30:49,083
Power outage!..Who knows when it will come again

335
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,708
Even God wouldn't know that

336
00:30:56,167 --> 00:31:00,625
Sing me that old lullaby ..in anadabhairavi

337
00:31:32,792 --> 00:31:43,375
A lullaby

338
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,917
Now..What do you want ?

339
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,708
I want to shift to the hostel, Grandpa

340
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:31,208
I can't reach the college on time due to traffic jams

341
00:32:31,458 --> 00:32:35,833
Two to three hours in traffic that too 
in heavy rain, Got fed up..

342
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:38,208
We can do something to make you cheer up

343
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,542
We will bring the college to nearby our house

344
00:32:42,875 --> 00:32:44,042
That is correct..a good idea

345
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:49,208
How intelligent my brother is!! 
 You should pickle your brain and preserve it..

346
00:32:50,125 --> 00:32:51,875
I got a meeting in the morning..I am off..

347
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:53,500
Papa...

348
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:56,458
You should study well...That is what I wish

349
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:59,583
I am not against your wishes.

350
00:32:59,792 --> 00:33:00,917
I will call the Principal

351
00:33:02,667 --> 00:33:06,500
Whenever you call, I will be there to attend.. 
Ok

352
00:33:07,542 --> 00:33:10,125
Now ..you should talk rest of the things to grandpa...

353
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:16,708
Grandpa..I have to talk to you. 
Let us sit down here. Come

354
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,417
Now, tell me

355
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,417
I am wearing purdah to the class 
since you asked me to wear it

356
00:33:28,083 --> 00:33:30,542
It is sweltering and I am sweating..Grandpa

357
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:34,708
If I sweat, I start itching all over the body.. 
The whole body becomes reddish...

358
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,458
You want to see?

359
00:33:36,625 --> 00:33:37,500
No..No

360
00:33:37,542 --> 00:33:40,250
Don't spoil your health getting oversmart..

361
00:33:40,583 --> 00:33:43,417
I hereby withdraw the insistence on purdah. Ok?

362
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:44,875
Thank you Grandpa..

363
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:49,375
Here, colleges don't have air conditioning as in the gulf.. 
That is why

364
00:33:50,042 --> 00:33:51,500
Got it

365
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,167
Brother.. 
Didn't I tell you to come last evening?

366
00:34:11,625 --> 00:34:14,917
Last evening, I had some other programme

367
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:16,833
Where? 
In my wife's house

368
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:19,917
In your new wife's house?

369
00:34:21,042 --> 00:34:23,750
I am getting complaints about you daily..

370
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:28,000
The MLA is not seen home after he won the elections.

371
00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:30,708
Do you have time?!

372
00:34:31,542 --> 00:34:34,500
You were on a trip all around 
the gulf with your new wife!!?

373
00:34:34,792 --> 00:34:36,583
Bro..That ..er..er

374
00:34:36,625 --> 00:34:39,042
Don't talk to me..I know everything

375
00:34:39,625 --> 00:34:42,792
If you go on like this..Have no doubt, Dude..

376
00:34:42,792 --> 00:34:45,500
I will get a better candidate there next time

377
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:47,750
Start the car..

378
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,792
What happened?

379
00:34:58,167 --> 00:35:03,208
I pawned Mira's necklace in a workshop for 25000 bucks..

380
00:35:03,625 --> 00:35:06,458
I went there with her to take it back

381
00:35:06,583 --> 00:35:07,042
Then?

382
00:35:07,333 --> 00:35:11,583
He got that 25000 and demands another 10000 as interest

383
00:35:11,917 --> 00:35:15,542
They detained her there and beat me up..

384
00:35:15,917 --> 00:35:18,250
What can we do now?

385
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:22,125
Don't say that. 
Have to save her somehow.

386
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,375
Or else, they might do something to her

387
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:28,250
Which is that workshop? Where is it?

388
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:30,042
Is this the place?

389
00:35:33,542 --> 00:35:36,083
He has brought some guys too....

390
00:35:37,917 --> 00:35:38,500
What is it?

391
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:40,542
Where is my Mira?

392
00:35:40,833 --> 00:35:42,208
She left after you left

393
00:35:43,083 --> 00:35:45,542
Hold..Did you come here with 
these guys for rowdyism??

394
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:49,208
Leave

395
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,583
Stop there 
Leave aside

396
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:54,500
Leave

397
00:35:54,792 --> 00:35:57,458
Leave me.. 
Go away..Go

398
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,375
Leave me..

399
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:06,375
Mira..

400
00:37:09,583 --> 00:37:13,250
Leave her..

401
00:37:13,458 --> 00:37:16,000
Look there..ok

402
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,833
Come, Mira

403
00:37:46,208 --> 00:37:46,875
Anand

404
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,792
What is it?

405
00:37:55,208 --> 00:37:56,500
It’s Ganja!

406
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
We can inform Police

407
00:38:10,875 --> 00:38:11,625
What is it?

408
00:38:12,208 --> 00:38:13,333
What happened?

409
00:38:14,833 --> 00:38:15,583
I will come right now

410
00:38:21,667 --> 00:38:22,542
What happened?

411
00:38:22,917 --> 00:38:25,250
Some students from the engineering 
college destroyed all these ,Sir

412
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,208
For what?

413
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:27,708
A guy had to give us some money...

414
00:38:27,917 --> 00:38:30,208
To get that, we detained the girl with him..

415
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:31,500
He harassed her

416
00:38:31,917 --> 00:38:34,583
Is this the place to rape her..you scoundrel!!

417
00:38:34,833 --> 00:38:37,750
I can tell you... 
Girl harassment cases are very serious nowadays..

418
00:38:38,042 --> 00:38:39,417
Show me those guys in the monitor

419
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:42,000
Did they notice about the drugs here

420
00:38:42,292 --> 00:38:43,250
Yes, I doubt sir

421
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:46,083
This was a safe place. 
You idiots botched everything

422
00:38:50,542 --> 00:38:51,542
Show me

423
00:38:53,792 --> 00:38:55,125
These are the guys..Sir

424
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,792
Isn't it Rajmohan sir's son?

425
00:38:58,333 --> 00:38:59,083
Anand

426
00:38:59,917 --> 00:39:02,208
Shift everything from here immediately

427
00:39:02,458 --> 00:39:03,208
Or.. we will have to face the consequences..

428
00:39:04,458 --> 00:39:09,042
Shift it to our old godown. It will be safe there

429
00:39:10,375 --> 00:39:11,792
Be fast

430
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:26,667
Isn't it the workshop 
Yes Sir

431
00:39:27,458 --> 00:39:28,750
Go and search..

432
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:37,750
Sir, I am Markose

433
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:41,125
That workshop belongs to one of us..

434
00:39:41,333 --> 00:39:42,375
Don't make it an issue

435
00:39:42,458 --> 00:39:43,792
What do you have there?

436
00:39:44,125 --> 00:39:45,500
A little ganja..That is all

437
00:39:49,917 --> 00:39:51,292
Is this a new place?

438
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,333
Yes Sir

439
00:39:52,583 --> 00:39:53,250
Shall I do a real search?

440
00:39:53,708 --> 00:39:55,083
No Sir..Don't trap sir, Please

441
00:39:55,458 --> 00:39:57,750
Kasim..Look at this

442
00:39:58,375 --> 00:39:59,208
When can we meet?

443
00:39:59,458 --> 00:40:00,542
Today evening itself

444
00:40:00,792 --> 00:40:01,542
What will you bring?

445
00:40:01,667 --> 00:40:03,500
Just tell me, Sir

446
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,042
Two lakh rupees and an I phone 10..Ok?

447
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:12,208
Ok Sir

448
00:40:12,417 --> 00:40:15,250
Don't open the iphone box

449
00:40:16,542 --> 00:40:20,750
Sir..I need that betrayer's number

450
00:40:21,125 --> 00:40:22,250
I will give you when I meet you.

451
00:40:23,167 --> 00:40:24,500
Where are you now?

452
00:40:25,042 --> 00:40:27,250
I came to get my bike from the workshop

453
00:40:27,375 --> 00:40:28,458
Ok..

454
00:40:28,458 --> 00:40:29,417
See you in the evening

455
00:40:29,458 --> 00:40:30,042
Ok Sir

456
00:40:39,083 --> 00:40:39,667
What happened, sir?

457
00:40:39,708 --> 00:40:40,542
Get in the Jeep. Let us go

458
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:43,500
There is huge load of ganja and drugs there.

459
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:45,792
I know that.But what can I do?

460
00:40:45,833 --> 00:40:47,458
Got a call from the minister's office

461
00:40:47,583 --> 00:40:48,042
Sir...But..

462
00:40:48,083 --> 00:40:50,708
Dude..We can't improve the world.... 
You get in the vehicle

463
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,000
Whatever...!

464
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:05,750
Sir I am Markose.. 
As we expected, those students have come with a complaint

465
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,125
Please deal with it properly Sir

466
00:41:07,917 --> 00:41:09,833
Ok..I will take care of that

467
00:41:11,875 --> 00:41:14,042
Some students have come from the engineering college

468
00:41:14,167 --> 00:41:14,667
Let them come in

469
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,542
What is the issue?

470
00:41:30,083 --> 00:41:33,167
Sir, Some guys molested this 
girl at the Modern workshop

471
00:41:33,583 --> 00:41:35,583
Molested or got her scared?

472
00:41:36,708 --> 00:41:40,167
Nowadays, punishment is sure if someone 
... looks at a girl for more than 14 secs.

473
00:41:40,417 --> 00:41:41,500
That is why I am asking you

474
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,583
Are you the one who gave a complaint?

475
00:41:44,167 --> 00:41:44,458
What is your name?

476
00:41:44,875 --> 00:41:46,458
-Mira 
-Sit down

477
00:41:47,667 --> 00:41:48,583
Who is this?

478
00:41:49,292 --> 00:41:50,208
Her fiancee

479
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:51,292
So what?

480
00:41:51,458 --> 00:41:53,833
So...A lover..What is your name?

481
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,333
Rathish..Sit down

482
00:41:57,708 --> 00:41:59,542
Who are you all?

483
00:41:59,542 --> 00:42:00,875
We are all her classmates

484
00:42:01,083 --> 00:42:03,375
You move aside. Let me talk to them

485
00:42:04,917 --> 00:42:06,083
Have you brought a written complaint?

486
00:42:06,292 --> 00:42:07,000
No Sir

487
00:42:07,042 --> 00:42:09,083
Thought we can give a complaint after talking to you

488
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:11,375
I have no paper here. Have you brought paper?

489
00:42:11,417 --> 00:42:12,208
Yes Sir

490
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:13,292
Give it

491
00:42:16,042 --> 00:42:19,583
Write whatever happened in detail in one paper

492
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,583
Your details in the other paper

493
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,708
We have to enquire about you too..

494
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,250
What to enquire about her, Sir?

495
00:42:27,083 --> 00:42:29,000
Whether this girl has lose morals..

496
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,500
Write down...Who were all that harassed you?

497
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:34,500
You know the names?

498
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,500
Peter, Suni, Mujib

499
00:42:37,583 --> 00:42:40,375
How do you know the names? 
Do you know them earlier?

500
00:42:40,667 --> 00:42:41,375
Yes Sir

501
00:42:41,583 --> 00:42:43,833
Isn't it a car workshop?

502
00:42:43,917 --> 00:42:45,667
Do you take your car there often?

503
00:42:45,792 --> 00:42:46,792
I don't have a car, Sir

504
00:42:46,917 --> 00:42:48,250
Then, How do you know them?

505
00:42:48,667 --> 00:42:49,542
Er...

506
00:42:50,083 --> 00:42:51,542
They sell ganja , Sir

507
00:42:51,542 --> 00:42:53,458
Oh..I see!!

508
00:42:55,542 --> 00:43:01,000
I had pawned my necklace for 25,000 rupees there. 
Went there to take it back

509
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:04,250
Who called the police station 
and said they do drug business?

510
00:43:04,333 --> 00:43:05,208
I did ,Sir

511
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:11,500
There was a govt. circular that if anyone gets to know of...

512
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:14,083
...drug peddling, ... it should be reported to the police

513
00:43:14,167 --> 00:43:14,792
In college

514
00:43:14,917 --> 00:43:17,208
But when we raided, we didn't get anything

515
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,500
You won't get Sir..

516
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:21,500
That disappeared when someone got something from them..

517
00:43:21,667 --> 00:43:22,875
Isn't that the truth, Sir?

518
00:43:23,125 --> 00:43:24,125
What is your name?

519
00:43:24,458 --> 00:43:25,208
Anand

520
00:43:25,875 --> 00:43:29,125
The name is good..You know which place is this?

521
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:30,792
Yes Sir, Police station

522
00:43:30,792 --> 00:43:33,250
It is good to have that knowledge

523
00:43:34,083 --> 00:43:34,875
Write down

524
00:43:36,083 --> 00:43:40,292
Three persons whom we know 
are connected with drug peddling

525
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:42,667
Peter,Sunil and Mujib

526
00:43:43,458 --> 00:43:45,083
Am I right with the names?

527
00:43:45,083 --> 00:43:45,750
Yes Sir

528
00:43:46,083 --> 00:43:48,458
These three guys together raped me..

529
00:43:50,042 --> 00:43:52,000
You will have to go for a medical checkup..

530
00:43:52,375 --> 00:43:53,458
To know if you are pregnant..

531
00:43:53,625 --> 00:43:56,542
Write in detail..whatever happened

532
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,458
When you go to the court, 
you have to repeat this accurately..

533
00:44:00,917 --> 00:44:03,875
Let us not lodge a complaint..Let us go

534
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:09,750
Now, only my mind and body have gone weak..

535
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:11,417
Mira..You?!

536
00:44:11,542 --> 00:44:14,208
If I lodge a complaint here, 
my honour also will be lost..

537
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:15,750
Then the only option would be suicide

538
00:44:16,542 --> 00:44:17,875
I have no complaint, Sir

539
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:19,208
No Complaint..

540
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:21,833
Thanks to you, Sir

541
00:44:21,833 --> 00:44:24,583
Wait..Where are you going?

542
00:44:24,875 --> 00:44:26,375
You wait there..

543
00:44:26,667 --> 00:44:29,625
She has no complaints..She leaves

544
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:32,458
What can I do? Can I register a case?

545
00:44:32,625 --> 00:44:35,000
But,I have received another complaint

546
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,542
We have to register a case on that

547
00:44:42,417 --> 00:44:44,125
Someone trespassed into Modern workshop..

548
00:44:44,333 --> 00:44:48,542
...and destroyed things worth 75000 rupees in a fight

549
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:51,542
Have to get that sum as compensation

550
00:44:51,833 --> 00:44:52,750
That is the complaint

551
00:44:53,292 --> 00:44:55,083
Can I not register a case?

552
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:56,375
No

553
00:44:56,417 --> 00:44:59,083
Then, register one more case, Sir.. 
For blocking harassment of a girl

554
00:44:59,167 --> 00:45:00,500
Are you ridiculing me?

555
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:05,083
When you come to know of such incidents, 
you should inform the police..

556
00:45:05,083 --> 00:45:06,917
Not going on a rampage there..

557
00:45:07,125 --> 00:45:08,333
Who do you think you are?

558
00:45:08,458 --> 00:45:10,625
If we had informed you, when would you come?

559
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:12,542
By the time the body is ready for inquest...??

560
00:45:13,125 --> 00:45:15,875
Talk properly.. otherwise, I will break your bones..

561
00:45:16,333 --> 00:45:19,125
Sir..You can charge any number of cases on us..

562
00:45:19,458 --> 00:45:22,792
We will go and meet the SP and the women's commission, 
 with our principal

563
00:45:23,208 --> 00:45:25,417
Sir, I have recorded everything you said here..

564
00:45:30,083 --> 00:45:32,208
Is it right to do all that?

565
00:45:33,458 --> 00:45:36,208
Anand, Why are you here?

566
00:45:36,375 --> 00:45:38,875
Markose Bro..We came with a sexual harassment case.

567
00:45:39,042 --> 00:45:40,458
Now the plaintiff became the defendant

568
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,250
Do you know each other?

569
00:45:42,458 --> 00:45:44,750
Sir..He is the son of our old SI, Rajmohan Sir

570
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,708
Oh..I see.. 
He doesn't go to college 
and does all rowdyism, Is it?

571
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:52,000
Are they not students, Sir? Leave them

572
00:45:52,167 --> 00:45:55,375
Leave them? Then who will pay the compensation?

573
00:45:55,417 --> 00:45:56,333
Will you pay them?

574
00:45:56,625 --> 00:45:59,708
Isn't it Modern workshop? Let me talk to them

575
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:02,167
If they don't compromise, 
then only we should go for arrests

576
00:46:02,417 --> 00:46:06,583
Just because you said, 
I am not arresting them now.

577
00:46:06,875 --> 00:46:08,625
Delete their recordings..

578
00:46:08,917 --> 00:46:10,042
Ok Sir

579
00:46:10,583 --> 00:46:12,625
Where is the phone?

580
00:46:20,417 --> 00:46:22,917
You can leave now

581
00:46:23,125 --> 00:46:26,583
Anand, Don’t complaint anywhere 
else on this issue Ok?

582
00:46:26,792 --> 00:46:28,417
Come

583
00:46:29,333 --> 00:46:32,167
Give my regards to your Dad

584
00:46:36,458 --> 00:46:38,417
Man with a good character

585
00:46:38,625 --> 00:46:40,708
Who gave you this name, Sir?

586
00:46:40,833 --> 00:46:43,000
My father..Why do you doubt?

587
00:46:43,833 --> 00:46:45,667
Anyone can make a blunder once..

588
00:46:47,042 --> 00:46:48,458
That was a blunder. I am sure

589
00:46:59,333 --> 00:47:00,417
Auntie..Are you going out?

590
00:47:00,458 --> 00:47:01,792
Anand Come

591
00:47:03,292 --> 00:47:04,458
How is your Dad now?

592
00:47:04,708 --> 00:47:06,500
Not much better, Aunty

593
00:47:06,792 --> 00:47:09,625
Anand, I heard something. Is it right..

594
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:11,458
What is there between you and Anjali?

595
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,792
Aunty..Please make her understand..

596
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:17,458
She is immature..

597
00:47:17,542 --> 00:47:18,667
Just an infatuation on me

598
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:20,667
You don't have it?

599
00:47:21,083 --> 00:47:23,000
She is very well-off..Daughter of a very rich person

600
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:24,250
What is my status?

601
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:27,417
Love also needs a minimum qualification

602
00:47:27,792 --> 00:47:30,167
Get her married to some nice guy, Aunty

603
00:47:30,292 --> 00:47:32,458
If I marry her, she will be in trouble

604
00:47:36,125 --> 00:47:40,042
It is getting late. Let me leave.. 
I will ask Krishnettan to call you from Dubai

605
00:47:40,125 --> 00:47:41,125
Ok Aunty

606
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,500
Dear..Please make her understand

607
00:47:47,042 --> 00:47:48,208
Did you listen to him?

608
00:47:48,667 --> 00:47:50,208
Mummy, Please get into the car

609
00:47:50,417 --> 00:47:53,333
Aunty..Should I come to the airport?

610
00:47:53,583 --> 00:47:56,333
-Let me go to the class. 
-How are you going?

611
00:47:56,833 --> 00:47:58,458
I will go with him

612
00:47:59,292 --> 00:48:01,667
-Will you give me a lift, Dude? 
-Sure

613
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:04,667
Ok Then, Dear

614
00:48:04,917 --> 00:48:08,542
Don't stick too much on him..Go..Go

615
00:48:19,083 --> 00:48:22,833
One sec.I want to talk to you something

616
00:48:23,833 --> 00:48:25,708
That is why I didn't go to the airport

617
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,167
What is that?

618
00:48:27,417 --> 00:48:29,292
Look, you are my best friend

619
00:48:30,208 --> 00:48:31,292
and I’m good to you also

620
00:48:32,458 --> 00:48:33,417
So what?

621
00:48:34,458 --> 00:48:37,458
I have never hidden anything from you till now

622
00:48:37,667 --> 00:48:38,667
You too were like that

623
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:43,292
But nowadays, you are hiding too many things from me

624
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:45,083
What are you getting at?

625
00:48:45,708 --> 00:48:47,792
I know you like Anjali

626
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,333
And she is even ready to die for you

627
00:48:51,375 --> 00:48:54,542
Then, why did you talk like that to her mother?

628
00:48:55,625 --> 00:48:57,208
I was giving facts..

629
00:48:57,250 --> 00:49:00,000
What?..Talking about your inabilities?!

630
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:02,708
She knows that better than you

631
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:04,708
Don't beat around the bush

632
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:08,083
If you don't like, you should 
have the courage to speak out..

633
00:49:08,417 --> 00:49:09,333
This is not right..

634
00:49:09,792 --> 00:49:12,625
What is your real problem? 
I won't tell anyone

635
00:49:12,625 --> 00:49:14,167
Open out to me bravely..

636
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:19,333
I have no problem..You just feel like that 
You are crazy

637
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:22,708
You are a cheat. Get lost. Useless

638
00:49:48,708 --> 00:49:52,500
I will tell you.. 
I don't want to hide anything from you

639
00:49:53,375 --> 00:49:56,125
I like Anjali..quite a lot

640
00:49:56,583 --> 00:49:59,417
But I am not in a mental framework to love her

641
00:49:59,458 --> 00:50:02,250
I have to find out the murderer of my mother..

642
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:04,708
That is what fills my mind now..

643
00:50:05,458 --> 00:50:08,542
Four years back..Wasn't it a normal road accident?

644
00:50:10,042 --> 00:50:12,458
But ,I am sure it was a planned murder

645
00:50:13,083 --> 00:50:16,458
I should know who killed my mother..

646
00:50:16,792 --> 00:50:17,458
And then??

647
00:50:18,125 --> 00:50:19,583
What are you aiming at?

648
00:50:20,583 --> 00:50:22,500
I don't know what will happen?

649
00:50:23,333 --> 00:50:24,333
Anything can happen

650
00:50:24,875 --> 00:50:25,667
Anything...

651
00:50:26,083 --> 00:50:27,000
Even death..

652
00:50:27,667 --> 00:50:32,917
If anything happens to me, 
.. Anjali would have to weep the whole life

653
00:50:34,125 --> 00:50:36,708
That is why, I am keeping a distance

654
00:50:38,333 --> 00:50:41,125
Not due to any dislike..rather, 
it is due to much of love

655
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:48,667
Whenever I go to sleep, Mummy's face comes to me

656
00:50:54,375 --> 00:50:55,208
Sorry..Dude

657
00:50:57,833 --> 00:51:01,500
Remember something..You are just 19 years old..

658
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:08,500
You have to study. Don't get yourself, tensed up

659
00:51:10,208 --> 00:51:12,208
Then, you will have time for that only

660
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:15,708
Our lives are very short..

661
00:51:16,208 --> 00:51:19,417
Be normal. Think about a better future

662
00:51:21,167 --> 00:51:24,917
Come on..Wear the helmet

663
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,500
Let us go

664
00:51:35,458 --> 00:51:39,333
Afnan...Look .Who is riding with him..!!

665
00:51:46,083 --> 00:51:47,708
Missed it

666
00:51:57,250 --> 00:51:58,125
Stop there..

667
00:51:58,375 --> 00:51:58,833
Why?

668
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,375
Who do you think you are?

669
00:52:00,583 --> 00:52:03,625
You are playing with fire..Beware!!

670
00:52:04,083 --> 00:52:06,500
What is your problem?

671
00:52:06,667 --> 00:52:08,042
You will know, when you get beaten up..

672
00:52:08,167 --> 00:52:09,833
Get lost....Don't try to scare me..

673
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,500
I am not of that kind..

674
00:52:18,542 --> 00:52:22,417
Stop there..

675
00:52:33,667 --> 00:52:35,500
What happened, bro?

676
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:37,750
Actually..What happened ?

677
00:52:37,792 --> 00:52:39,167
Tell me .What is the problem?

678
00:52:39,292 --> 00:52:40,417
What is your problem?

679
00:52:42,458 --> 00:52:44,792
He hurt you. I won't leave him

680
00:52:44,833 --> 00:52:49,208
I know how to deal with him. 
I don't need your help

681
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,792
Did you come here to study or 
on a contract to hit people?

682
00:52:53,083 --> 00:52:55,542
Finish your acts today.

683
00:52:55,708 --> 00:52:57,625
Or else, I will hit some of your teeth off..

684
00:52:57,625 --> 00:52:59,708
Go and study..Go

685
00:53:00,125 --> 00:53:02,250
Go to the class

686
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:14,125
Why did you talk all those dialogue in front my mother?

687
00:53:14,208 --> 00:53:15,125
You could have told..

688
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:16,458
What?

689
00:53:16,667 --> 00:53:18,708
That you like me..

690
00:53:20,333 --> 00:53:22,917
For that, are we in love?

691
00:53:25,917 --> 00:53:28,125
Don't make me mad..

692
00:53:28,458 --> 00:53:30,083
That is what I am scared too

693
00:53:30,125 --> 00:53:33,083
What? 
Whether you will go mad..

694
00:53:34,917 --> 00:53:38,792
When you plan to chop off boys' genitals...

695
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:41,250
Who will be brave enough to marry you?

696
00:53:41,875 --> 00:53:47,167
-What did you say? -Boys'.. 
What ..What?

697
00:54:01,708 --> 00:54:10,000
“You are my only hearthrob..”

698
00:54:11,583 --> 00:54:19,375
“You are my only desire on earth”

699
00:54:21,167 --> 00:54:29,917
“On this scorching road, you became a cool shower”

700
00:54:30,458 --> 00:54:39,542
“You are the melody in the song of the nightingale”

701
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:47,167
“You are my only heartthrob”

702
00:55:15,833 --> 00:55:25,667
“On a decorated swing of memories, you came in an evening”

703
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:35,042
“Then, you joined me as a friend on my journey”

704
00:55:35,458 --> 00:55:45,208
“On that day you became my soul”

705
00:55:45,417 --> 00:55:53,750
“Tenderely embraced me, with lots of hope remaining..”

706
00:55:54,333 --> 00:55:59,625
“Just like the first rain, that gets woven into the earth”

707
00:55:59,917 --> 00:56:03,667
“I waited just to dissolve into you..”

708
00:56:03,917 --> 00:56:12,750
“You are my only heartthrob”

709
00:56:13,292 --> 00:56:23,167
“On this scorching road, you became a cool shower”

710
00:56:23,417 --> 00:56:31,792
“You are the melody in the song of the nightingale”

711
00:56:32,583 --> 00:56:42,750
“You are my only heartthrob”

712
00:56:50,375 --> 00:56:52,792
Anand. I have to talk to you

713
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:53,625
What is that?

714
00:56:54,083 --> 00:56:55,417
What could be that?

715
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:58,875
I am Lakshmi..Iyer girl from Palakkat

716
00:56:59,000 --> 00:56:59,792
Not that..

717
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:00,750
Then?

718
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:03,125
I just decided to become good

719
00:57:03,333 --> 00:57:04,500
But,why?

720
00:57:04,542 --> 00:57:07,042
Afraid of getting blows

721
00:57:07,083 --> 00:57:09,042
I am afraid you might beat me up

722
00:57:09,333 --> 00:57:12,375
If you had beaten me on that day , 
..I would have become good on that spot..

723
00:57:12,417 --> 00:57:16,458
I expected one that day..Why you didn't do that?

724
00:57:16,667 --> 00:57:19,000
Due to your beautiful teeth..

725
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:21,500
If you get a real blow from me, 
... at least four of them would fall down

726
00:57:22,083 --> 00:57:25,208
Then you will have to live with dentures the whole life..

727
00:57:25,333 --> 00:57:26,625
It won't be required now..

728
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:30,167
I am going to pass all the supplementaries 
and become the topper in class

729
00:57:30,167 --> 00:57:31,125
You just check..

730
00:57:31,125 --> 00:57:32,167
Very good

731
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:37,792
Can I take you as an elder brother, 
.. though you are younger to me?

732
00:57:38,083 --> 00:57:42,125
I have no siblings, Dude

733
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:44,083
Oh..That is ok

734
00:57:48,083 --> 00:57:49,500
Look..Look

735
00:57:50,458 --> 00:57:53,250
The black princess is being a cheat?

736
00:57:54,167 --> 00:57:55,333
I will kill her

737
00:57:55,333 --> 00:57:59,083
First, you learn to kill a cockroach 
and then, human beings

738
00:58:00,125 --> 00:58:01,583
I can't even laugh?

739
00:58:02,875 --> 00:58:05,542
You come..come

740
00:58:06,042 --> 00:58:08,000
Come..

741
00:58:08,417 --> 00:58:11,083
Anand, Come

742
00:58:12,792 --> 00:58:14,625
Not going to the playground today?

743
00:58:15,042 --> 00:58:17,792
Yes..Let me have a black tea 
Brother...A black tea...

744
00:58:18,833 --> 00:58:20,917
What was going on with that black princess?

745
00:58:21,417 --> 00:58:22,500
Oh..Nothing

746
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:24,875
Look here..everyone...Magic

747
00:58:36,417 --> 00:58:38,042
Take it back to them..

748
00:58:40,333 --> 00:58:41,542
Playing around with the spoon..

749
00:58:45,833 --> 00:58:47,458
That magic was super..

750
00:58:47,625 --> 00:58:50,042
Jayakrishanettan spoiled it..

751
00:58:51,125 --> 00:58:54,333
Next four days are holidays

752
00:58:55,208 --> 00:58:57,167
Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday

753
00:58:57,375 --> 00:58:58,417
What will we do?

754
00:58:58,583 --> 00:58:59,625
Shall we go to Vegaland?

755
00:58:59,625 --> 00:59:01,917
Why do you think like a primary school kid?

756
00:59:02,167 --> 00:59:03,208
Why don't you think differently?

757
00:59:03,333 --> 00:59:07,917
Goa or Bangalore. What about Goa? 
I got a few friends there.

758
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,750
And we will get some apartments or hotels to stay

759
00:59:11,583 --> 00:59:14,000
What do you think ?

760
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:17,583
I am not there. Dad is alone at home

761
00:59:18,333 --> 00:59:20,292
We can talk to uncle and find a solution

762
00:59:20,625 --> 00:59:22,167
Won't do

763
00:59:22,917 --> 00:59:24,125
Then I am not there too

764
00:59:25,625 --> 00:59:26,917
Anand Just a sec.

765
00:59:29,667 --> 00:59:34,458
If you back out, this trip won't take place 
I know ..your problem is cash

766
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:38,500
And your pride is large..Listen to me this time

767
00:59:39,333 --> 00:59:40,625
Give me cash whenever you have it

768
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:41,458
Still??!

769
00:59:41,583 --> 00:59:44,250
No "still". We are going..Ok?

770
01:00:53,167 --> 01:00:56,583
Alex..A room for girls ..a room for boys!!

771
01:00:56,833 --> 01:00:58,667
You are too smart!!

772
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:00,583
Ya..What do you think about me?

773
01:01:01,458 --> 01:01:04,333
Aren't you a cheetah?

774
01:01:04,875 --> 01:01:06,625
Shall we go to some nice club?

775
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:09,500
That is right 
I was about to tell you

776
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:11,542
There are lot of night clubs here

777
01:01:12,083 --> 01:01:13,667
Let the ladies remain here 
We will go

778
01:01:13,875 --> 01:01:15,417
What is wrong if we come

779
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:18,625
Dude..Foreign ladies go there.. 
Then why not us?

780
01:01:18,917 --> 01:01:21,208
That won't be alright

781
01:01:22,375 --> 01:01:23,417
Why not?

782
01:01:29,708 --> 01:01:32,125
We are not going to booze..Dear

783
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:37,917
We will have juice or cola and 
enjoy listening to songs and dances

784
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:43,542
Come

785
01:01:57,667 --> 01:02:04,625

01:10:26,625 --> 01:10:27,875
Something has happened in that room!!

841
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:29,833
What ? 
Ansy..

842
01:10:30,167 --> 01:10:31,333

01:11:00,583 --> 01:11:01,667
Anand ..

848
01:11:02,458 --> 01:11:03,500
How is he now?

849
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:05,917
Not conscious yet..How about Ansy?

850
01:11:06,292 --> 01:11:07,875
She is gradually coming back

851
01:11:08,083 --> 01:11:09,292

852
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:11,417

01:11:18,167 --> 01:11:20,375
Something fishy has happened..I am sure..

855
01:11:35,292 --> 01:11:39,000
Ansy...Just try to recollect

856
01:11:39,292 --> 01:11:40,667
What happened

857
01:11:41,542 --> 01:11:43,417
Who did this to you?

858
01:11:45,583 --> 01:11:47,708
I can't remember any thing

859
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,583
Anand, I loved him so dearly..still!!

860
01:11:54,250 --> 01:11:55,583
Don't cry..

861
01:11:55,750 --> 01:11:58,000
Let her recollect..

862
01:11:59,083 --> 01:12:02,792
He did it..Anand... I am sure...rogue

863
01:12:07,667 --> 01:12:10,083
Come. Let us sit inside. 
Next trip is getting late

864
01:12:13,375 --> 01:12:14,333
Same..

865
01:12:16,250 --> 01:12:17,333
A little more

866
01:12:36,625 --> 01:12:40,708
No..That rascal we met at the bar..

867
01:12:45,208 --> 01:12:47,083
He came here last night

868
01:12:53,458 --> 01:12:55,500
It was he who harassed me

869
01:13:09,042 --> 01:13:11,458
Where is Anand..? 
It was that rogue who harassed her..

870
01:13:14,292 --> 01:13:15,833
Where are they? 
They went outside..

871
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:19,875
Vinod,that rascal we met in the bar.. 
He harassed her..

872
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:20,875
We should get hold of him..

873
01:13:21,333 --> 01:13:22,708
They went to catch hold of him..

874
01:14:34,667 --> 01:14:37,625
Grandpa, I am at the airport..

875
01:14:38,083 --> 01:14:39,167
Papa is coming from Mumbai..

876
01:14:40,458 --> 01:14:44,167
I saw Aysha coming out from the airport arrival 
... and going in a taxi

877
01:14:45,458 --> 01:14:47,167
Didn't you ask her from where she is coming?

878
01:14:47,333 --> 01:14:48,292
No Grandpa..

879
01:14:48,458 --> 01:14:49,458
Why?

880
01:14:49,667 --> 01:14:51,292
The other guy was also with her..

881
01:14:51,375 --> 01:14:52,792
Who is that other guy?

882
01:14:52,833 --> 01:14:55,250
Anand, whom you saw in the photograph..

883
01:14:55,833 --> 01:14:57,875
I have sent a photograph just now

884
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:03,917
Did you see that?

885
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:08,000
I told you earlier itself, 
that boy is not alright.

886
01:15:08,250 --> 01:15:10,500
If you had given him whatever 
he deserved, on that day itself

887
01:15:10,583 --> 01:15:11,875
He would have stopped it then and there..

888
01:15:12,375 --> 01:15:16,792
Now, he has started flying with her..

889
01:15:17,167 --> 01:15:20,333
I will not pardon you if our family gets ill repute

890
01:15:20,542 --> 01:15:21,458
Remember that..

891
01:15:36,167 --> 01:15:39,417
What did the doctor say? 
He says she is alright..

892
01:15:40,750 --> 01:15:43,542
That fellow has hurt her too badly

893
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:47,792
It is better to lodge a complaint 
with the police..He says

894
01:15:50,542 --> 01:15:54,708
No..I am not interested in complaining anywhere.

895
01:15:55,250 --> 01:15:57,750
If my parents come to know about this!!

896
01:15:58,417 --> 01:16:00,417
They will not live anymore.

897
01:16:00,458 --> 01:16:01,917
Don't cry, Ansy

898
01:16:04,292 --> 01:16:06,375
I am responsible for this Goa trip..

899
01:16:07,083 --> 01:16:10,375
Ansy..This happened due to me.

900
01:16:11,167 --> 01:16:14,208
If you like me..I will be always there with you

901
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:17,667
Till death..

902
01:16:21,458 --> 01:16:23,500
Do you like him?

903
01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:25,542
Do you like him?

904
01:16:29,708 --> 01:16:29,917
Dude..

905
01:16:34,208 --> 01:16:34,833
Don't cry

906
01:16:35,917 --> 01:16:36,208
Come

907
01:16:42,667 --> 01:16:45,333
18 missed calls...My God!

908
01:16:45,708 --> 01:16:46,750
Papa..!

909
01:16:46,792 --> 01:16:47,667
Oh..My!!

910
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:54,625
What is it ,Papa?

911
01:16:54,875 --> 01:16:56,167
Aysha, Where are you?

912
01:16:56,458 --> 01:16:57,292
In the hostel..

913
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,417
Take the car to Aysha's hostel..

914
01:17:11,583 --> 01:17:15,250
Aysha...What are you doing there?

915
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:16,542
Studying... Papa.

916
01:17:16,625 --> 01:17:19,208
Come down fast..

917
01:17:19,417 --> 01:17:20,583
I am waiting outside..

918
01:17:22,542 --> 01:17:25,292
Papa..I am not there in the hostel now..

919
01:17:26,583 --> 01:17:28,833
No..? Then , where are you?

920
01:17:29,083 --> 01:17:30,625
In a friend's house

921
01:17:30,667 --> 01:17:32,292
Which friend?

922
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:34,917
Anjali

923
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,292
Krishnakumar's daughter?

924
01:17:37,792 --> 01:17:39,833
I know that house .I will come there now.

925
01:17:40,083 --> 01:17:43,750
Papa..Er..I am in another friend's house, with Anjali..

926
01:17:44,458 --> 01:17:47,708
Aysha, Are you trying to fool me?

927
01:17:47,792 --> 01:17:50,542
I am not of that sort. 
You know me very well..

928
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:56,250
I want to see you right now. 
Come home immediately. Ok?

929
01:17:57,250 --> 01:17:58,250
Ok , Papa

930
01:18:21,292 --> 01:18:22,125
Khader..

931
01:18:22,125 --> 01:18:22,750
Tell me, Sir

932
01:18:22,750 --> 01:18:24,542
I have sent somone's photographs to you..

933
01:18:25,042 --> 01:18:26,833
Handle him properly

934
01:18:27,083 --> 01:18:28,667
Let him know who we are..

935
01:18:29,208 --> 01:18:30,417
Ok Boss

936
01:18:56,750 --> 01:19:00,917
I pampered you a lot since 
your mother is no more..

937
01:19:01,750 --> 01:19:03,500
That was wrong on my part.

938
01:19:04,458 --> 01:19:08,292
That is why, you are loitering around now..

939
01:19:08,583 --> 01:19:11,083
What wrong did I do, Papa? 
No

940
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,292
No..Don't tell me anything

941
01:19:14,083 --> 01:19:15,292
I know everything..

942
01:19:16,125 --> 01:19:18,375
You have started lying to me..

943
01:19:19,333 --> 01:19:22,750
So, don't think that 
I will believe you any more

944
01:19:25,125 --> 01:19:29,042
Listen to me properly 
You are not going to the college any more..

945
01:19:29,833 --> 01:19:31,500
Your wedding will take place soon

946
01:19:31,917 --> 01:19:33,167
Next Saturday

947
01:19:33,292 --> 01:19:35,083
Papa..I have to continue my studies, Please..

948
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:39,333
You and your bridegroom can decide 
on that after your marriage

949
01:19:40,333 --> 01:19:42,458
I don't need a marriage now..Papa

950
01:19:42,875 --> 01:19:46,125
If I decide on something, 
I know how to get it done..

951
01:19:46,875 --> 01:19:47,833
You know me quite well!

952
01:20:00,333 --> 01:20:02,417
I can understand you

953
01:20:02,625 --> 01:20:03,708
Do something..

954
01:20:04,917 --> 01:20:07,708
You meet the boy..

955
01:20:09,250 --> 01:20:12,083
If you don't like him..Ok 
But you have to give reason

956
01:20:12,458 --> 01:20:15,458
Why you don't like him....Got it?

957
01:20:17,375 --> 01:20:22,458
Karim..Have they come? 
Call the boy here

958
01:20:32,708 --> 01:20:35,167
Raise your head and look at him..

959
01:20:42,208 --> 01:20:44,167
Faizal bro..Are you going to marry me?

960
01:20:45,458 --> 01:20:47,042
You could have told me earlier..

961
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:48,750
Why do you give me so much tension?

962
01:20:49,083 --> 01:20:51,292
I came to know about this, 
only half an hour back

963
01:20:51,667 --> 01:20:55,125
I got panicky when I was asked 
to come from Dubai..

964
01:20:55,833 --> 01:20:58,167
Now you don't have to panic..

965
01:20:58,458 --> 01:20:58,875
Papa..

966
01:20:59,208 --> 01:21:02,917
Faizal is my dear friend..I agree hundred per cent

967
01:21:04,417 --> 01:21:09,125
Amina, Why are you keeping aloof? Come here

968
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:18,625
You always used to say that I don't care about you 
.. my younger sister

969
01:21:20,042 --> 01:21:24,083
Now, are you happy? 
I am giving you my darling daughter..

970
01:21:25,625 --> 01:21:27,042
Look after her well..

971
01:21:27,375 --> 01:21:28,625
You don't have to tell me that..

972
01:21:29,208 --> 01:21:31,500
She is my darling too

973
01:21:31,750 --> 01:21:33,625
Aunt..Will I be a hassle for you?

974
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:34,417
What?

975
01:21:34,667 --> 01:21:35,417
To bear me..

976
01:21:35,583 --> 01:21:36,708
Get lost, Dear..

977
01:21:37,125 --> 01:21:39,542
Are you not my child? I will bear you..Come

978
01:21:48,083 --> 01:21:51,625
Papa..We misunderstood her a lot..

979
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,333
Not only her..but Anand too

980
01:21:54,458 --> 01:21:56,125
He is a nice boy..

981
01:21:56,583 --> 01:21:58,667
Oh..My God..Oh..

982
01:21:59,042 --> 01:21:59,833
What happened?

983
01:22:11,083 --> 01:22:11,833
Boss..

984
01:22:11,833 --> 01:22:14,583
Khader..Don't do anything

985
01:22:14,625 --> 01:22:15,292
What happened?

986
01:22:15,583 --> 01:22:18,917
Don't do anything to him..He is a nice boy..

987
01:22:19,167 --> 01:22:20,708
We misunderstood him..

988
01:22:23,833 --> 01:22:28,792
Papa..You didn't even discuss with me!

989
01:22:29,083 --> 01:22:30,292
Needn't have done that..

990
01:22:30,583 --> 01:22:33,792
What happened, Bro? 
That quotation is cancelled..

991
01:22:34,750 --> 01:22:37,583
Asking me to do it yesterday 
and today, not to do it..

992
01:22:37,708 --> 01:22:38,583
How can that be?

993
01:22:38,667 --> 01:22:41,917
What will we do now to pay advance for that property? 
Too bad

994
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:43,917
Sit down

995
01:22:44,458 --> 01:22:46,500
Greetings.

996
01:22:46,542 --> 01:22:49,042
Go there

997
01:22:52,792 --> 01:22:55,625
I told you I will get it done.. 
Let this function be over

998
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,125
Bawa Bro..

999
01:22:58,250 --> 01:23:00,208
My God!! Athisayan!!

1000
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:03,417
Grandpa..Look, Who has come

1001
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,792
We misunderstood you a lot..

1002
01:23:12,833 --> 01:23:15,875
I know Aysha and him right from LKG.

1003
01:23:15,917 --> 01:23:18,708
If you talk nonsense about them, God won't forgive you

1004
01:23:20,875 --> 01:23:24,792
We couldn't recognise the depth of your friendship

1005
01:23:25,083 --> 01:23:29,417
It is Ok..You forget that.. 
Hydros..

1006
01:23:30,292 --> 01:23:33,667
Come here..Look who is he?

1007
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:38,333
Do you recognise him?

1008
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:40,375
Anand?

1009
01:23:43,792 --> 01:23:44,500
Come..

1010
01:24:05,542 --> 01:24:32,542
Traditional wedding song

1011
01:28:22,292 --> 01:28:23,333
What is this ,man?

1012
01:28:23,625 --> 01:28:24,292
Why, sir?

1013
01:28:25,375 --> 01:28:26,000
Look

1014
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:32,875
Sir..I don't understand anything

1015
01:28:32,917 --> 01:28:34,167
This is a trap, Sir..

1016
01:28:36,417 --> 01:28:37,750
He is totally corrupt..Takes bribe..

1017
01:28:37,792 --> 01:28:38,458
Be careful about your words..

1018
01:28:41,542 --> 01:28:44,292
That is a truth everyone knows ..

1019
01:28:46,375 --> 01:28:48,083
I want to talk to you, Sir

1020
01:28:48,292 --> 01:28:49,042
Tell me

1021
01:28:49,125 --> 01:28:52,000
The girl whom you see in the photograph, 
has lodged the complaint.

1022
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:54,625
He harassed her in Goa.

1023
01:28:54,792 --> 01:28:57,000
The girl is not even 18 years old..

1024
01:28:57,208 --> 01:28:58,667
So, this case comes under Pocso..

1025
01:28:59,208 --> 01:29:03,083
If I don't arrest him in this case, 
I will lose my job, Sir.

1026
01:29:03,667 --> 01:29:04,625
This is a trap Sir

1027
01:29:05,542 --> 01:29:07,750
The incident happened in Goa

1028
01:29:07,875 --> 01:29:08,792
Not here

1029
01:29:08,792 --> 01:29:11,000
But, since the complaint is lodged here

1030
01:29:11,292 --> 01:29:14,792
I have to take him into custody, finish formalities 
...and hand over him to the Goa police

1031
01:29:15,167 --> 01:29:17,333
That is all what we can do in this..

1032
01:29:17,458 --> 01:29:19,625
The rest will be taken care of by the Goa police

1033
01:29:19,708 --> 01:29:23,417
If this complaint is a trap then he has to report it .. 
..wherever it should be reported.

1034
01:29:23,583 --> 01:29:26,500
Not to me..Please let me do my duty..

1035
01:29:26,917 --> 01:29:30,333
Anand..If you are innocent, 
we can easily prove that in the court.

1036
01:29:31,167 --> 01:29:32,625
Don't you get tensed

1037
01:29:32,875 --> 01:29:34,667
Let the inspector do his duty..

1038
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:42,000
Thank you sir

1039
01:29:45,833 --> 01:29:46,792
What is it ,Sir?

1040
01:29:46,792 --> 01:29:48,000
Get him inside

1041
01:29:48,292 --> 01:29:50,417
Get in..Anand, Anand

1042
01:29:51,542 --> 01:29:52,625
Where are you taking him?

1043
01:29:52,708 --> 01:29:53,500
Move aside

1044
01:29:53,583 --> 01:29:54,458
I said move aside

1045
01:29:55,042 --> 01:29:56,500
Move..

1046
01:29:56,625 --> 01:29:57,083
Where are you taking him?

1047
01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:59,750
What is the issue ,Sir. Why do you take him?

1048
01:30:00,125 --> 01:30:01,042
We want to know that

1049
01:30:01,208 --> 01:30:02,792
I will tell that wherever I am supposed to report 
No..No

1050
01:30:02,833 --> 01:30:03,833
Tell us and take him

1051
01:30:04,042 --> 01:30:05,167
Move away

1052
01:30:06,333 --> 01:30:08,500
Coming to interfere during duty..

1053
01:30:08,750 --> 01:30:10,292
Start the vehicle..Markose

1054
01:30:24,458 --> 01:30:25,833
Is it SI, Suseelan?

1055
01:30:26,167 --> 01:30:27,000
Yes. Who is this?

1056
01:30:27,375 --> 01:30:29,500
I am Rajmohan, old SI

1057
01:30:30,792 --> 01:30:31,500
Yes..I recognise you

1058
01:30:32,167 --> 01:30:34,125
You must be calling to talk 
about your son's case, Is it?

1059
01:30:34,458 --> 01:30:35,042
Yes

1060
01:30:35,833 --> 01:30:38,708
He is innocent..Someone trapped him

1061
01:30:39,250 --> 01:30:40,333
Please don't harm him

1062
01:30:40,458 --> 01:30:44,500
Sir..Your words are the same 
as any criminal's father's words.

1063
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:48,625
Sir, Do you know? 
He has come here before in a another case of a brawl

1064
01:30:49,292 --> 01:30:51,500
That day, I released him thinking of you.

1065
01:30:51,792 --> 01:30:54,042
But, this is a different case. Pocso

1066
01:30:54,333 --> 01:30:57,833
Complaint from a girl less than 18 years old.. 
that he harassed her

1067
01:30:58,250 --> 01:31:00,833
If I don't proceed, I will be punished..you know well

1068
01:31:01,375 --> 01:31:04,917
Sir..You proceed legally to get him released.

1069
01:31:05,333 --> 01:31:06,083
Listen to me ..er..

1070
01:31:11,750 --> 01:31:15,042
He cut the line

1071
01:31:16,292 --> 01:31:18,708
Your Dad..Says you are innocent.

1072
01:31:19,208 --> 01:31:21,333
If so, prove it in the court

1073
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:25,542
What can I do? 
This case is different

1074
01:31:25,667 --> 01:31:26,500
Pocso

1075
01:31:27,250 --> 01:31:31,667
My darling is going to face it. 
Minimum ten years in jail ..

1076
01:31:47,208 --> 01:31:48,625
Put your signature here

Tell me ,Sir

1097
01:33:42,833 --> 01:33:46,583
Two guys you took into custody now.. 
Don't take it very seriously

1098
01:33:46,917 --> 01:33:49,250
Settle it amicably

1099
01:33:50,292 --> 01:33:51,917
Couldn't get you ..sir

1100
01:33:52,167 --> 01:33:55,583
I am interested in that case..Leave it..

1101
01:33:56,542 --> 01:34:00,792
Drugs that cost around 3.5 crores 
in international market is seized.

1102
01:34:01,542 --> 01:34:03,333
They have international connections.

1103
01:34:03,792 --> 01:34:06,583
The goods were supposed to be smuggled 
out through Cochin airport

1104
01:34:07,708 --> 01:34:10,833
Rajmohan..I am in Dubai now

1105
01:34:11,792 --> 01:34:14,250
Otherwise, I would have met you personally

1106
01:34:15,208 --> 01:34:17,417
Doesn't matter. I will send a person to you

1107
01:34:17,750 --> 01:34:20,792
Just tell him how much you want..he will do that

1108
01:34:22,542 --> 01:34:25,417
I haven't accepted a bribe in my whole career, sir

1109
01:34:26,542 --> 01:34:27,833
I don't intend to do that now

1110
01:34:28,833 --> 01:34:31,000
Don't waste your time, Sir

1111
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:36,458
You are just an SI and you 
are being arrogant towards me..

1112
01:34:36,667 --> 01:34:38,833
Not arrogance Sir..But being sincere

1113
01:34:39,083 --> 01:34:40,875
Towards the people and towards my job

1114
01:34:41,917 --> 01:34:43,417
There are people who get into power by appeasing public...

1115
01:34:43,625 --> 01:34:47,000
and then start looting them..like you Sir

1116
01:34:47,583 --> 01:34:48,583
They won't understand that

1117
01:34:48,875 --> 01:34:50,417
Enough...

1118
01:34:50,792 --> 01:34:54,917
Don't think that I am finished, 
just because I got defeated in an election.

1119
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:55,917
I will make a comeback

1120
01:34:56,125 --> 01:34:57,917
Again as an MLA and a MInister

1121
01:34:58,083 --> 01:34:59,917
I will see you then..

1122
01:34:59,917 --> 01:35:03,583
Stop it..You will do bullshit.. 
Cut the crap and get lost..

1123
01:35:10,125 --> 01:35:12,667

1124
01:35:13,250 --> 01:35:14,083

I gave him enough now..You too want?

1128
01:35:21,875 --> 01:35:27,042
Sir, Don't make this an issue.. 
There are lot of big guys behind this

1129
01:35:28,042 --> 01:35:31,333
They are ready to give you whatever you want. 
Then..Why not, Sir?

1130
01:35:31,417 --> 01:35:34,417
You idiot..I will beat you to pulp.. 
Get up..

1131
01:35:35,042 --> 01:35:38,417
I should have put you and Kesavan behind bars 
..and charge case..Get out....

1132
01:35:38,542 --> 01:35:43,042
Sir..Don't be oversmart..You will get it from them.. 
Get out..

1133
01:35:50,417 --> 01:35:52,125
What happened? 
Will have to find other options..

1134
01:35:52,833 --> 01:35:58,708
What is this Kumaretta..!?? 
They don't let any criminals to be punished

1135
01:36:06,333 --> 01:36:08,000
Sit down

1136
01:36:08,792 --> 01:36:10,000
No Sir..I will stand

1137
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:12,875
Sit Down..I am telling you..

1138
01:36:15,167 --> 01:36:17,917
Kasim..Did you give him any food?

1139
01:36:18,167 --> 01:36:19,792
No Sir..He said he doesn't need

1140
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:23,083
Don't remain hungry..

1141
01:36:23,333 --> 01:36:24,208
I don't need any food, Sir

1142
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,083
That won't do..Asoka

1143
01:36:32,042 --> 01:36:35,500
Give him some bananas and biscuits

1144
01:36:36,583 --> 01:36:42,167
Or get Parotta and mutton chaps from Chandra Hotel 
That will do

1145
01:36:42,417 --> 01:36:42,917
Ok

1146
01:36:44,500 --> 01:36:48,167
Why do you get invovled in such 
things at this young age?

1147
01:36:48,667 --> 01:36:50,292
I haven't done anything wrong, Sir

1148
01:36:51,208 --> 01:36:55,792
All criminals say the same. 
Give me some new dialogue

1149
01:36:58,625 --> 01:37:00,458
Kasim..You can go

1150
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:07,667
Your Dad is now without a job, Right?

1151
01:37:08,708 --> 01:37:10,417
Then, how do you live?

1152
01:37:11,167 --> 01:37:13,125
Heard that you are a good fighter

1153
01:37:13,583 --> 01:37:15,500
Do you go for quotation jobs?

1154
01:37:18,792 --> 01:37:21,708
Was his mother beautiful..Asoka?

1155
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:24,375
Yes..Sir She was beautiful

1156
01:37:24,583 --> 01:37:29,250
Fair complexioned with shapely body.. 
Anyone would just glance at her..So beautifull

1157
01:37:29,542 --> 01:37:32,042
Poor lady..She is no more..

1158
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:34,333
Dead ..Is it?

1159
01:37:34,500 --> 01:37:36,833
Otherwise she would have made money..

1160
01:37:37,833 --> 01:37:41,208
When starving..no one would blame her too

1161
01:37:42,667 --> 01:37:43,792
Even if she prostitutes..

1162
01:37:53,583 --> 01:37:56,417
You getting angry?..Dirty dog

1163
01:38:01,917 --> 01:38:03,375
If so, hit me

1164
01:38:03,833 --> 01:38:09,125
Not for hitting but to kill you.. 
that is what I feel

1165
01:38:10,292 --> 01:38:11,375
Then, kill me

1166
01:38:24,542 --> 01:38:25,833
Just can't

1167
01:38:26,583 --> 01:38:27,875
Why can't you?

1168
01:38:29,250 --> 01:38:30,167
Just can't

1169
01:38:31,708 --> 01:38:33,583
Why you can't?

1170
01:38:34,083 --> 01:38:37,042
I owe my body to a khakhi cap..No sir

1171
01:38:38,250 --> 01:38:41,542
No Sir No

1172
01:40:40,125 --> 01:40:45,708
Another custodial death for Kerala police to write off.. 
Don't you get an inkling of that?

1173
01:41:15,208 --> 01:41:16,208
Sir 
Where is SI?

1174
01:41:16,458 --> 01:41:18,417
No Sir

1175
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:22,000
Did you take an engineering student 
called Anand to custody?

1176
01:41:22,125 --> 01:41:23,208
Yes Sir

In the lock-up

1178
01:41:25,042 --> 01:41:27,042
Call SI and ask him to come here immediately

1179
01:41:48,792 --> 01:41:51,208
Bring him here

1180
01:42:20,542 --> 01:42:23,208

1181
01:42:24,250 --> 01:42:25,667
Ruined him..

1182
01:42:27,083 --> 01:42:28,333
Pitiable

Clean him and bring him here

1184
01:42:53,167 --> 01:42:54,625

report the facts to the headquarters

01:43:15,250 --> 01:43:18,292
You should cooperate with me..Sit down

1191
01:43:28,417 --> 01:43:30,458
Did they hurt you too much

1192
01:43:37,333 --> 01:43:38,000
Suseelan?

1193
01:43:38,375 --> 01:43:40,042
Yes, sir

1194
01:43:42,042 --> 01:43:43,875
Special order..

1195
01:43:45,458 --> 01:43:48,458
What is this ,Man? 
Why did you hurt him so much?

1196
01:43:48,708 --> 01:43:50,917
When he began to run from the jeep..

1197
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:52,333
Oh..The usual excuse..

1198
01:43:54,750 --> 01:43:56,125
Give me a paper

1199
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:06,083
Give me a complaint that they hurt you

1200
01:44:27,333 --> 01:44:28,917
I have no complaint ,Sir

1201
01:44:34,792 --> 01:44:36,583
Where is the complaint against him?

1202
01:44:36,625 --> 01:44:38,625
I have it Sir

1203
01:44:43,292 --> 01:44:45,917
A complaint from a girl called Karthika

1204
01:44:46,250 --> 01:44:47,875
Anand had sexually harassed her..

1205
01:44:48,375 --> 01:44:50,208
The girl is not even 18 years old.

1206
01:44:50,417 --> 01:44:52,125
So, the case comes under pocso

1207
01:44:52,667 --> 01:44:53,500

01:44:53,667 --> 01:44:55,792
No Sir. We are registering it today

1209
01:44:56,917 --> 01:44:58,250

How?

1218
01:45:16,250 --> 01:45:18,250

01:47:38,417 --> 01:47:39,583
No Sir

1255
01:47:40,625 --> 01:47:41,625
Do you have birth certificate?

1256
01:47:41,667 --> 01:47:42,375
Yes Sir

1257
01:47:44,417 --> 01:47:46,208
Carrying it always..Is it?

1258
01:47:49,167 --> 01:47:50,500
This is a copy. Where is the original?

1259
01:47:50,875 --> 01:47:52,500
That is in college in Goa

1260
01:47:59,625 --> 01:48:00,917
Sit down

1261
01:48:04,667 --> 01:48:08,167
In which school you studied here?

1262
01:48:09,167 --> 01:48:09,917
In Devamatha

1263
01:48:11,042 --> 01:48:13,208
Venu..Devamatha 
Take it fast

1264
01:48:17,042 --> 01:48:21,625
Karthika, What did he do to you?

1265
01:48:22,833 --> 01:48:23,833
Harassed me, Sir

1266
01:48:24,167 --> 01:48:25,083
From where?

1267
01:48:26,250 --> 01:48:27,708
In a hotel in Goa

1268
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:31,875
How many times?

1269
01:48:33,542 --> 01:48:34,292
Twice

1270
01:48:34,583 --> 01:48:35,542
Only that much?

1271
01:48:38,042 --> 01:48:41,417
Age 17...Harassment

1272
01:48:50,042 --> 01:48:52,667
He can be jailed for twelve years..

1273
01:48:55,042 --> 01:48:55,833
Can I register the case?

1274
01:48:58,917 --> 01:49:01,875
-Yes Sir 
-You won't change your words later, Right?

1275
01:49:03,917 --> 01:49:04,500
No Sir

1276
01:49:06,458 --> 01:49:09,000
This is original and this is duplicate

1277
01:49:15,250 --> 01:49:16,667
Reduced one year...

1278
01:49:19,417 --> 01:49:21,167
You are past 18.

1279
01:49:22,500 --> 01:49:24,250
Why did you lie?

1280
01:49:27,250 --> 01:49:28,667
Tell me

1281
01:49:29,167 --> 01:49:32,375
For the strength of the case..

1282
01:49:33,458 --> 01:49:34,583
Really?

1283
01:49:37,542 --> 01:49:40,167
Who told you that it will strengthen your case?

1284
01:49:42,625 --> 01:49:45,125
Who made you do this?

1285
01:49:45,708 --> 01:49:49,250
Who took you to these boys in Goa?

1286
01:49:57,417 --> 01:49:59,292
No reply..Right?

1287
01:50:01,042 --> 01:50:02,583
Karthyayini..

1288
01:50:06,708 --> 01:50:09,042
Madam..Please come

1289
01:50:09,333 --> 01:50:10,667
Probably to beat her up

1290
01:50:10,708 --> 01:50:11,667
Please come

1291
01:50:23,208 --> 01:50:24,625
The old woman is finished!!

1292
01:50:27,167 --> 01:50:29,542
What happened? 
They recognised the person, Sir

1293
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:32,667
It is this guy, Sir

1294
01:50:32,875 --> 01:50:33,667
Vinod

1295
01:50:34,125 --> 01:50:35,125
This is not Vinod..Sir

1296
01:50:35,625 --> 01:50:37,042
His name is Vikram

1297
01:50:37,292 --> 01:50:38,583
Vempala Vikram

1298
01:50:38,917 --> 01:50:41,042
Vempala Vikram

1299
01:50:43,792 --> 01:50:44,708
Do you know him?

1300
01:50:47,542 --> 01:50:48,708
Do you know him?

1301
01:50:49,583 --> 01:50:52,792
Tell the truth fast.. 
Or Karthyayani will take you too...

1302
01:50:53,208 --> 01:50:56,708
Do you know him?

1303
01:50:57,417 --> 01:50:58,583
I know him, Sir

1304
01:50:58,625 --> 01:51:02,167
I used to meet him sometimes

1305
01:51:02,500 --> 01:51:04,792
Was he the person who made you do all this?

1306
01:51:05,500 --> 01:51:06,167
Yes Sir

1307
01:51:07,250 --> 01:51:08,417
Do you know who he is..

1308
01:51:09,583 --> 01:51:11,875
He is not Vinod..But Vikram

1309
01:51:12,667 --> 01:51:15,792
Vempala Vikram who is a criminal in hiding..

1310
01:51:16,208 --> 01:51:17,625
He is charged in many cases..

1311
01:51:18,667 --> 01:51:22,833
If you are in his company, 
you will land up in jail..

1312
01:51:23,792 --> 01:51:26,542
No..Sir I am not in his company..

1313
01:51:26,792 --> 01:51:29,000
He calls me sometimes and gives money. 
That is all

1314
01:51:32,250 --> 01:51:37,625
Now tell me..Did Anand sexually harass you?

1315
01:51:40,625 --> 01:51:42,500
Has he slept with you?

1316
01:51:43,583 --> 01:51:45,667
No Sir

1317
01:51:46,167 --> 01:51:47,542
Then,what about these photographs..?

1318
01:51:47,542 --> 01:51:49,375
That was done at Vinod's insistence

1319
01:51:49,417 --> 01:51:50,583
Vikram

1320
01:51:51,458 --> 01:51:52,500
How?

1321
01:51:53,292 --> 01:51:57,458
From the bar, they were brought drugged and dozed

1322
01:51:57,667 --> 01:51:59,667
Come here..

1323
01:51:59,708 --> 01:52:02,625
Sir..Now you can ask her anything..

1324
01:52:02,833 --> 01:52:04,542
She will blurt out the truth..

1325
01:52:05,500 --> 01:52:08,708
No ..She won't tell truth that fast..Karthyayani

1326
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:13,792
No, Sir, I will tell the truth..You ask me anything

1327
01:52:15,375 --> 01:52:16,708
You ask me, Sir

1328
01:52:17,417 --> 01:52:23,208
Only one questioon.. 
What did you get in this deal?

1329
01:52:23,292 --> 01:52:26,458
I got ten lakhs and she got five lakhs

1330
01:52:26,792 --> 01:52:30,250
We have to get ten lakhs, the balance, from them

1331
01:52:30,500 --> 01:52:31,583
Ten lakhs?

1332
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,458
That is enough

1333
01:52:33,833 --> 01:52:36,583
Now you don't talk anything..Give it in writing

1334
01:52:36,708 --> 01:52:39,583
Karthyayani..Get it written.. neatly

1335
01:52:43,708 --> 01:52:47,875
Sir..Please pardon me..

1336
01:52:59,250 --> 01:53:00,500
Where is Anand?

1337
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:04,000
He will come 
Don't get upset. He will come

1338
01:53:18,375 --> 01:53:21,875
This is Gafur, Sir

1339
01:53:21,917 --> 01:53:25,750
Your guess was right. He is innocent

1340
01:53:26,792 --> 01:53:31,250
In that case, release him immediately

1341
01:53:45,250 --> 01:53:47,042
I have reported it in detail

1342
01:53:48,417 --> 01:53:49,667
Release that poor lad..

1343
01:53:52,125 --> 01:53:54,250
He might get me a dismissal

1344
01:54:19,917 --> 01:54:22,792
Things look like out of our control..

1345
01:54:23,208 --> 01:54:24,375
What happened?

1346
01:54:24,417 --> 01:54:29,125
Case could not be charged against him. 
The DYSP released him

1347
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:31,417
And gave him certificate that he is innocent

1348
01:54:32,042 --> 01:54:39,167
CM and DGP has interfered in this. 
I don't understand why

1349
01:54:40,667 --> 01:54:45,833
I heard DGP was being asked to 
reopen the old accident case..

1350
01:54:45,875 --> 01:54:49,500
Try to pay him something and settle the case

1351
01:54:50,833 --> 01:54:53,250
Not possible. He is a very straightforward person.

1352
01:54:53,542 --> 01:54:57,000
Let him enquire the case. He may even find the truth

1353
01:54:57,292 --> 01:55:02,083
But, if the case has to go to 
court where are the evidences?

1354
01:55:03,333 --> 01:55:06,500
Even his dead father can make it..

1355
01:55:06,625 --> 01:55:07,458
I am sure about that

1356
01:55:07,542 --> 01:55:08,875
Still...Be careful

1357
01:55:36,083 --> 01:55:37,458
What if someone notices this number?

1358
01:55:39,125 --> 01:55:43,583
The number of this vehicle actually belongs 
to a vehicle in the workshop since a month

1359
01:55:44,375 --> 01:55:47,167
It will take another one month for that vehicle 
to come out of workshop

1360
01:55:48,500 --> 01:55:53,833
After our requirement, this vehicle will use the 
original number and go for trips..

1361
01:55:54,167 --> 01:55:56,167
That is it..Simple

1362
01:55:59,583 --> 01:56:01,208
It is time for him to come..

1363
01:56:03,125 --> 01:56:04,250
Wear the mask

1364
01:56:14,250 --> 01:56:15,917
There..they are going..Take the vehicle

1365
01:56:17,500 --> 01:56:19,250
Today his wife is also with him..

1366
01:56:19,375 --> 01:56:21,833
Let them get ruined..two birds in one shot..

1367
01:56:22,292 --> 01:56:24,167
If it is two, the rate will increase

1368
01:56:24,167 --> 01:56:26,583
Can you make it 20 from 15?

1369
01:56:26,833 --> 01:56:28,542
Ok..You get it done

1370
01:56:38,708 --> 01:56:42,667
After the next turn it is an isolated place. 
We can do it there..

1371
01:56:42,708 --> 01:56:44,583
Ok..OK

1372
01:56:47,750 --> 01:56:50,250
Fast..

1373
01:57:22,375 --> 01:57:27,833
Anand..Why are you walking?

1374
01:57:27,917 --> 01:57:28,792
I will drop you..Get in

1375
01:57:29,083 --> 01:57:29,667
No Sir

1376
01:57:29,875 --> 01:57:30,708
We will walk down..

1377
01:57:30,708 --> 01:57:33,042
Get in..I have to talk to you

1378
01:57:33,167 --> 01:57:36,208
You go to Anand's house. I will drop him there

1379
01:57:36,917 --> 01:57:41,042
Sir..Officers like you are the only hope for the people

1380
01:57:42,250 --> 01:57:43,458
Anand, Get in

1381
01:57:45,792 --> 01:57:46,292
Get in

1382
01:57:46,917 --> 01:57:48,500
Who are you?

1383
01:57:48,500 --> 01:57:51,167
I am Lakshmi ,an Iyer girl from Palakkat

1384
01:57:51,250 --> 01:57:52,583
They are all my friends

1385
01:57:54,708 --> 01:57:58,042
Iyer girl..I like your boldness.

1386
01:58:04,708 --> 01:58:07,833
Why you are telling to everyone 
that you are Iyer girl?

1387
01:58:08,250 --> 01:58:11,542
Otherwise he will think I will be a tribal woman

1388
01:58:11,750 --> 01:58:13,667
That’s right. You have much resemblance

1389
01:58:13,917 --> 01:58:16,208
You get lost

1390
01:58:37,833 --> 01:58:41,875
Don't you feel angry at the policemen 
who thrashed you up like this?

1391
01:58:42,250 --> 01:58:43,000
Yes

1392
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:47,042
Then, why did you say there was no complaint?

1393
01:58:47,792 --> 01:58:50,833
What can you do if I give a complaint?

1394
01:58:51,583 --> 01:58:52,833
I would have taken serious actions..

1395
01:58:54,167 --> 01:58:57,500
What action Sir? Just a transfer

1396
01:58:58,167 --> 01:59:00,750
Or, just a suspension..that is all

1397
01:59:02,292 --> 01:59:07,750
Can you return just one blow that I got?

1398
01:59:09,542 --> 01:59:10,708
Can't.. Is it?

1399
01:59:12,167 --> 01:59:15,375
Suspension would be just for six months, at the most

1400
01:59:16,625 --> 01:59:18,792
He will get half the salary sitting at home

1401
01:59:19,708 --> 01:59:23,083
If he can influence a politician 
... he can again get into service easily..

1402
01:59:25,042 --> 01:59:27,250
And gets the remaining half of the salary

1403
01:59:28,167 --> 01:59:33,167
I have nothing to say Anand..Let me ask you something

1404
01:59:35,417 --> 01:59:39,125
Why do SI Suseelan and the other policemen 
.. have such a vengeance on you?

1405
01:59:45,750 --> 01:59:46,708
I will tell you, Sir

1406
01:59:56,500 --> 01:59:58,583
Not just that, Anand

1407
01:59:59,292 --> 02:00:02,250
just a month before SI Rajmohan's accident,

1408
02:00:02,500 --> 02:00:05,917
... drugs worth 6 crores were confiscated on road checking

1409
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:06,917
I know Sir

1410
02:00:08,292 --> 02:00:10,542
Two culprits were caught on that day, out of three

1411
02:00:11,208 --> 02:00:14,083
They are in central jail now on a 11year term

1412
02:00:15,042 --> 02:00:17,833
But, one guy escaped...

1413
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,583
It is him..the criminal who is still on prowl..

1414
02:00:22,792 --> 02:00:27,208
Vikram who trapped you in Goa..Venpala Vikram

1415
02:00:31,833 --> 02:00:37,458
When I knew that he was behind this, 
...I joined the two guys who are in jail

1416
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:41,333
I gave them opportunities to make phone calls.. 
and I recorded that

1417
02:00:42,833 --> 02:00:47,750
I am sure..It was not an accident..

1418
02:00:52,083 --> 02:00:53,583
We will find the culprits soon

1419
02:00:54,500 --> 02:00:59,250
But the court will ask for evidences.. 
It is not easy to collect evidences

1420
02:01:00,542 --> 02:01:04,000
Even if there are evidences, 
it will not reach the court, Sir

1421
02:01:05,292 --> 02:01:08,542
Drug mafia is a huge racket, Anand

1422
02:01:09,167 --> 02:01:13,542
There are even political leaders 
and criminal officials with them

1423
02:01:14,833 --> 02:01:20,667
Don't we have laws to shoot them dead 
like in some other countries? Sir

1424
02:01:21,625 --> 02:01:26,250
No? We need such laws to save our country

1425
02:01:26,917 --> 02:01:31,458
Otherwise poor citizens of this country ... 
...will have to live a life of slavery under them

1426
02:01:31,625 --> 02:01:35,458
My 19 year old body was smashed by them

1427
02:01:36,625 --> 02:01:40,583
Till yesterday, I was too sensitive 
and soft hearted..But

1428
02:01:41,708 --> 02:01:45,292
Today..My mind has the power of steel.. 
I can face anything

1429
02:01:47,500 --> 02:01:52,667
It is good to be enthusiastic and confident.. 
But you should be very careful

1430
02:01:53,125 --> 02:01:57,042
There will be several forces to support the enemies.. 
...and you are very young too

1431
02:01:59,083 --> 02:02:03,542
Thank you very much a lot.. 
Sir, for saving me from this trap..

1432
02:02:13,833 --> 02:02:17,208
Almost over..Shouldn't I come? Ok

1433
02:02:20,917 --> 02:02:22,125
Where is Anand, Sir?

1434
02:02:23,125 --> 02:02:24,792
He hasn't reached home yet? 
No Sir

1435
02:02:24,792 --> 02:02:27,458
You said you would drop him at home..

1436
02:02:27,917 --> 02:02:30,125
But he said he doesn't need that..

1437
02:02:30,167 --> 02:02:32,000
He didn't contact you till now? 
No Sir

1438
02:02:32,083 --> 02:02:35,250
He came to meet me at the hostel, 
but left immediately

1439
02:02:35,542 --> 02:02:36,583
Why did he come..

1440
02:02:36,667 --> 02:02:39,292
He said it is urgent and took my ATM card

1441
02:02:39,458 --> 02:02:40,458
How much was there in that?

1442
02:02:40,708 --> 02:02:42,000
About a lakh of rupees

1443
02:02:54,167 --> 02:02:57,042
Is it the airport officer 
Sir, I am Gafur DYSP

1444
02:02:57,875 --> 02:02:59,708
I want an info urgently

1445
02:03:00,042 --> 02:03:07,208
Just to know if a boy called Anandraj, 19 years old 
..boarded a domestic flight after 10 AM today

1446
02:03:07,500 --> 02:03:10,292
Excuse me Sir..Please check the Goa flight first

1447
02:03:11,375 --> 02:03:12,917
I can wait..Thank you, sir

1448
02:03:16,292 --> 02:03:21,333
If my guess is right, he has gone to Goa

1449
02:03:21,375 --> 02:03:22,833
Can you give me his mobile number

1450
02:03:23,417 --> 02:03:25,917
His phone was damaged at the police station, Sir

1451
02:03:26,458 --> 02:03:29,542
I have given one of my phones to him..for me to call 
Give me the number

1452
02:03:30,083 --> 02:03:34,125
9946159198

1453
02:03:34,792 --> 02:03:37,917
I tried in that..But can't get him..

1454
02:03:41,917 --> 02:03:43,750
Is there GPS tracking in that?

1455
02:03:43,792 --> 02:03:46,542
Yes Sir..It is linked to my phone

1456
02:03:50,625 --> 02:03:55,500
Is it? Ok Sir. Thank you. Sir

1457
02:03:56,292 --> 02:04:00,208
He has gone to Goa by the 10.30 flight

1458
02:04:00,500 --> 02:04:04,917
Alex, give your phone to Anjali and you keep Anjali's phone.. 
Come on..Quick

1459
02:04:06,333 --> 02:04:09,208
Sir..Shall I too come with you?

1460
02:04:09,208 --> 02:04:09,792
What the hell!!

1461
02:04:09,792 --> 02:04:12,000
Get in fast..

1462
02:04:15,417 --> 02:04:16,583
Let us go, Sir

1463
02:04:25,083 --> 02:04:26,875
We just reached Goa

1464
02:04:29,542 --> 02:04:33,167
Couldn't trace out till now..We are on the way..

1465
02:04:37,083 --> 02:04:40,500
Check how far we have to go now?

1466
02:04:46,833 --> 02:04:50,750
Not even a fly should come here without my knowledge.. 
Be careful

1467
02:05:23,708 --> 02:05:26,000
Who is this?..Come.. come..

1468
02:05:26,583 --> 02:05:30,500
I was about to come there to meet you.. 
To put you also on the wheel chair..

1469
02:06:56,667 --> 02:06:58,125
Tie him up...

1470
02:07:59,083 --> 02:08:01,500
We should have finished you on 
that day itself here in Goa..

1471
02:08:02,917 --> 02:08:05,917
I wish to see you lodged in a jail..

1472
02:08:07,292 --> 02:08:11,667
That is why I let you off.. 
Your story should end here..

1473
02:08:27,250 --> 02:08:29,875
Goan police is ready to support you Sir

1474
02:08:30,833 --> 02:08:33,875
Definitely we will put additional forces 
to support you, Sir Why not?

1475
02:10:02,167 --> 02:10:09,167
Anand No..No

1476
02:10:10,583 --> 02:10:13,375
Sir this place is totally flooded with drugs

1477
02:10:15,458 --> 02:10:16,542
Search Please

1478
02:10:18,250 --> 02:10:24,000
He is Vikram ..a wanted criminal.. Arrest him

1479
02:10:24,458 --> 02:10:26,417
We should hospitalise him fast

1480
02:10:26,667 --> 02:10:28,125
Take him.. Fast

1481
02:11:39,500 --> 02:11:44,417
Stop..Stop..Park here

1482
02:11:47,167 --> 02:11:48,292
You can go

1483
02:11:49,125 --> 02:11:51,375
Over speed..Fined five hundred bucks..

1484
02:11:51,417 --> 02:11:54,292
Dude..I am son of ex Minister Kesavan..Suraj Kesavan

1485
02:11:54,292 --> 02:11:57,125
Ok Sir..Just tell that to SI and then you can go

1486
02:11:58,792 --> 02:12:00,458
Darned checking..

1487
02:12:02,708 --> 02:12:07,917
Sir..Speed was 120. Son of ex minister Keasavan .. 
He is asking whether he can go

1488
02:12:15,083 --> 02:12:17,250
Ex minister's son doesn't have to follow rules?

1489
02:12:18,125 --> 02:12:21,625
It is just 500 bucks. 
Can't you pay that and go

1490
02:12:22,625 --> 02:12:27,375
Should I pay? 
Yes..Don't you see everyone paying?

1491
02:12:31,708 --> 02:12:32,917

1492

His father is still in Dubai ..Is it? 
Yes, Sir. He will come soon

1498
02:12:58,833 --> 02:13:00,583
The election is fast approaching

1499
02:13:05,292 --> 02:13:06,167
Tell me

1500
02:13:07,750 --> 02:13:10,667
Are you sure it is them?

1501
02:13:11,667 --> 02:13:13,667
Ok

I am SI, Anandraj,..

02:13:19,917 --> 02:13:22,333
Two culprits who have jumped prison

..may pass through Thrissur according to the shadow police

1505
02:13:25,625 --> 02:13:27,000
Shall I trap them?

1508
02:13:34,375 --> 02:13:36,792
For what , Sir? 
SP's Order

1509
02:13:37,583 --> 02:13:39,042
Take it out..

1510
02:13:55,042 --> 02:13:56,833
KL 07 BG 2100

1511
02:13:56,875 --> 02:14:01,167
White Innova taxi..Will come here .. 
...don't let them leave.. catch hold of them

1512
02:14:12,125 --> 02:14:18,458
Stop...Stop

02:14:18,833 --> 02:14:23,167
Don't leave him..Catch him..

1514
02:14:23,750 --> 02:14:26,375
You thought you won't be caught? Come

1515
02:14:31,500 --> 02:14:33,667
Markose..Keep an eye on him.. 
Ok Sir

1516
02:14:40,708 --> 02:14:42,958
What the hell you did? Why didn't you inform?

1517
02:14:43,042 --> 02:14:45,583
That fellow took everyones' phones.

1518
02:14:45,625 --> 02:14:46,792
Dammit!!

1519
02:14:47,375 --> 02:14:49,083
Let me tell boss

1520
02:14:51,750 --> 02:14:55,500
I am handcuffed and tied in the jeep by an SI 
I don't know his name

1521
02:14:55,875 --> 02:14:56,833
I will give the phone to Markose

1522
02:14:58,417 --> 02:15:00,500
Sir It is SI, Anand

1523
02:15:01,292 --> 02:15:03,208
Give some dough and settle it..

1524
02:15:03,917 --> 02:15:07,500
No.. Not possible. 
He is the son of our old SI Rajmohan

1525
02:15:08,500 --> 02:15:09,458
Oh..I see

1526
02:15:09,792 --> 02:15:12,542
Now, he will also have to be sent to a wheelchair

1527
02:15:12,708 --> 02:15:15,125
Release him without his knowledge

1528
02:15:15,500 --> 02:15:17,625
That is risky, Sir. I will lose my job

1529
02:15:17,750 --> 02:15:19,875
I will give you whatever you want..

1530
02:15:32,083 --> 02:15:32,750
Get in..

1531
02:15:38,500 --> 02:15:39,500
Markose..Where is he?

1532
02:15:40,500 --> 02:15:44,125
I just went for a leak and he escaped, 
ran towards that side..

1533
02:15:51,417 --> 02:15:54,500
He is there.. 
Where?

1534
02:15:54,667 --> 02:15:57,458
Shall I go with them 
No..If you go, it will be a problem here

1535
02:16:33,125 --> 02:16:35,167
Just fed up..

1536
02:16:35,167 --> 02:16:36,875
He is not here..Sir

1537
02:16:37,167 --> 02:16:38,125
I know

1538
02:16:38,458 --> 02:16:41,583
Then why did we climb all the steps and came here. 
He must have escaped

1539
02:16:41,792 --> 02:16:44,417
Not that he escaped...But he was made to escape..

1540
02:16:50,708 --> 02:16:53,167
Out of two jail breakers, one is in our custody

1541
02:16:53,833 --> 02:16:55,167
The other one escaped, Sir

1542
02:16:57,875 --> 02:17:00,458
Give me two days. I will get him

1543
02:17:02,083 --> 02:17:07,708
There is a sad news, Sir. 
One of us is no more

1544
02:17:07,792 --> 02:17:10,250
Yes Sir, Died in an accident

1545
02:17:10,417 --> 02:17:12,708
Driver Markose

1546
02:17:14,208 --> 02:17:16,667
Sir..I will call you back in a sec

1547
02:17:17,708 --> 02:17:19,792
Sir..Who died? I am not dead, Sir

1548
02:17:19,958 --> 02:17:21,875
I am Markose. I am with you

1549
02:17:22,208 --> 02:17:24,625
I am not dead..What are you talking?

1550
02:17:45,250 --> 02:17:50,958
You are dead and gone..

1551
02:17:52,958 --> 02:17:58,458
You should have died earlier. 
Then, many criminals would not have escaped..

1552
02:17:58,667 --> 02:18:01,500
Lot of students would not have become drug addicts

1553
02:18:02,125 --> 02:18:04,375
Lot of families would not have been ruined..

1554
02:18:05,875 --> 02:18:08,167
My father would not have faced this fate..

1555
02:18:09,375 --> 02:18:10,708
My mother was killed

1556
02:18:11,375 --> 02:18:14,917
The moment I knew that it was you, 
I was there behind you.

1557
02:18:14,958 --> 02:18:16,500
Like a shadow

1558
02:18:16,500 --> 02:18:21,583
Till now, you did a lot of crimes..

1559
02:18:22,375 --> 02:18:23,542
No evidences..

1560
02:18:25,667 --> 02:18:27,042
You destroyed all evidences

1561
02:18:27,208 --> 02:18:30,292
So, no court can punish you.

1562
02:18:31,083 --> 02:18:36,583
But, my own court has pronounced your sentence

1563
02:18:40,500 --> 02:18:46,792
I will kill you here. And no evidences will be left 
Not even this..

1564
02:18:49,583 --> 02:18:55,667
Only one person will leave here alive. 
That won't be you..

1565
02:21:51,500 --> 02:21:55,833
I should have killed you earlier 
I was waiting for an occasion like this..

1566
02:21:59,542 --> 02:22:01,250
You thought that I was a fool. Is it?

1567
02:22:01,500 --> 02:22:05,167
Now you won't go alive from here..It will be me..

1568
02:22:05,583 --> 02:22:09,875
You go, Anand, to your mother..

1569
02:22:13,292 --> 02:22:15,042
Release the lock and shoot..

1570
02:22:52,583 --> 02:22:59,667
Wait..

1571
02:23:06,167 --> 02:23:06,917
Wait..

1572
02:23:09,625 --> 02:23:13,417
What happened to You? 
You are behaving like this after a long time!!

1573
02:23:13,542 --> 02:23:15,042
Have you gone nuts?

1574
02:23:15,583 --> 02:23:18,333
You used to complain that I was not at all romantic..

1575
02:23:18,375 --> 02:23:21,833
Now, I can be a romantic as you wish..a real romantic.... 
You wait and see

1576
02:23:22,917 --> 02:23:26,500
Dear..Please don't leave me alone ..never

1577
02:23:27,500 --> 02:23:31,917
I love you so much. Can't stay away from you.

1578
02:23:32,167 --> 02:23:33,417
Promise?

1579
02:23:35,208 --> 02:23:38,625
So..When is our wedding?

1580
02:23:38,875 --> 02:23:40,417
Any time

1581
02:23:43,667 --> 02:23:46,917
Now, I will choke you with love..

1582
02:23:47,958 --> 02:23:48,625
As much as I desire

1583
02:23:48,792 --> 02:23:53,083
My desire won't end...Till death
