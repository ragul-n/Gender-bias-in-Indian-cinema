Hello… Welcome to Irendri News…

2
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:14,792
Breaking New.

3
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:22,333
The savage villain for dastardly
defiling the innocent woman.

4
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:24,708
The Supreme Court has at last sentenced.

5
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:27,125
Recommending and sending the beast,
who will be hanged in a few days...

6
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:35,417
to the famous and renowned doctor in India Dr.
Aditya for treatment has become a hot topic.

7
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:38,333
Sara… Sara… Sara…

8
00:01:38,583 --> 00:01:42,050
For last few days, at every nook and corner and on everybody lips,

9
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:45,003
this Junior doctor Sara’s name reverberated all over India.

10
00:01:45,917 --> 00:01:50,000
She is the student of the Dr. Aditya.

11
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,659
Under his able guidance, she has
successfully carried out many experiments.

12
00:01:55,151 --> 00:01:57,445
The Prime Minister our country has congratulated her for being

13
00:01:57,461 --> 00:01:59,726
applauded by Cambridge University for her outstanding experiments.

14
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:03,500
Doctor Sara has declared that she will bring about
ground-breaking changes in the medical field.

15
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:09,417
Experts opined that in the years to come,
there will be only bio-wars.

16
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:34,208
Tell Sara…

17
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:37,167
I just wanted to speak to you about the
research I have submitted to you, sir.

18
00:03:37,167 --> 00:03:39,042
I have read it, Sara. It’s very nice.

19
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:44,958
Your idea of immunity booster, so that people will
not get affected by contagious diseases, is very good.

20
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,000
Thank you very much, sir.

21
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,583
But only you can help us take this forward.

22
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:48,208
Definitely.

23
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:10,417
Sir,
that criminal is going to be hanged on 10th.

24
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,417
So, we have very less time.

25
00:04:12,417 --> 00:04:13,125
Ok, Sara.

26
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:15,000
I’ll update you by tomorrow.
-Thank you, sir.

27
00:04:20,917 --> 00:04:22,250
What to do?

28
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:24,542
Is it necessary to take this much risk?

29
00:04:25,292 --> 00:04:27,125
Sara is undoubtedly, a brilliant student…

30
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,708
Ok. I’ll call DGP and see.
He will give a right advice.

31
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:34,583
Is it necessary to tell
about this thing now?

32
00:04:36,417 --> 00:04:36,917
No…

33
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:41,000
How about taking his advice,
without revealing about this thing?

34
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:46,417
Hello?

35
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,458
Yes, did you remember your best friend now.

36
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:51,458
How are you?

37
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:53,167
I am fine, brother.

38
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:54,208
How are you?

39
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,250
You already know…

40
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,917
My whole time is revolving
around hospital and research lab.

41
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,792
How is every one at home?

42
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,792
We are fine.
Everyone is in good health, brother.

43
00:05:03,917 --> 00:05:06,292
I want a small suggestion from you.

44
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:11,417
I anticipated when you called me. I thought
what about him? Why is he calling me now?

45
00:05:12,042 --> 00:05:12,833
That is...

46
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,417
If 10 members benefit and 1 bad guy suffers
injustice, as a consequence of one thing….

47
00:05:17,792 --> 00:05:18,708
would you say it is Ok?

48
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:21,208
I don’t know what you are referring to…

49
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:25,083
but if 10 members get profited,
then anything can be done?

50
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,083
Moreover, you are saying that a
rogue will get victimized, right?

51
00:05:29,542 --> 00:05:31,000
Don’t think too much…

52
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,667
Call me, if you need my help.

53
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:34,958
Ok.

54
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,833
Find some time and come home.

55
00:05:37,292 --> 00:05:38,917
Sure. I’ll call you again.

56
00:05:39,042 --> 00:05:39,917
Ok.

57
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:44,792
He is also of the opinion that it is Ok.

58
00:05:45,542 --> 00:05:48,708
So, it looks there is nothing wrong,
even if we take some risks.

59
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:50,500
But...

60
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:54,333
is it safe to send that criminal with them?

61
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,625
I have to send someone with them.

62
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,500
Rudra…

63
00:05:58,792 --> 00:05:59,500
yes…

64
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:02,417
there will be no problem,
if Rudra accompanies them.

65
00:06:28,167 --> 00:06:30,375
Rudra? What are you doing?

66
00:06:35,167 --> 00:06:38,083
Hey, to hit the ball I deliver,
someone from top should come and play?

67
00:06:38,292 --> 00:06:39,500
Hey, give that ball, buddy.

68
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,292
Hey, give that ball, buddy.

69
00:06:41,292 --> 00:06:44,083
You said there will be 4, there are 6 here.

70
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:46,750
6 members??? Can you manage, bro?

71
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:51,000
I am not only a doctor...

72
00:06:51,542 --> 00:06:52,708
I am a fighter too.

73
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,167
Hey, give that ball, bro.

74
00:07:26,167 --> 00:07:26,792
Take it.

75
00:07:55,292 --> 00:07:58,375
Hey, from where you have come? You have
come to our place and thrashing our friends?

76
00:07:58,375 --> 00:07:59,708
You eve tease ladies?

77
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:05,708
You are not connected
with this issue… get out

78
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:11,458
Hey Ganesh, gulp him like fish.

79
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,625
Hey... you...

80
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:27,958
You are not connected with this problem.
If you poke your nose in this…..

81
00:08:29,917 --> 00:08:31,833
Hey Somu, at least you beat him.

82
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,208
Hey, you come…
-Coming, bro…

83
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,167
Come…
-Bro…

84
00:08:43,792 --> 00:08:46,792
you were saying something earlier… fish?
-I didn’t say anything, bro.

85
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:49,000
Cat?? Something you said?
-No… I didn’t say anything, bro.

86
00:08:49,417 --> 00:08:51,667
Hey, who are you?
Why are you beating us? Hey, you only?

87
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,208
Hey, you wait, bro…

88
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:54,792
What??
-Gone…

89
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,208
You don’t know, why I am thrashing you?

90
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:56,833
No…

91
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:09,083
He appears lean like a broomstick.
How did he beat us like that?

92
00:09:09,167 --> 00:09:10,833
He applied technique in thrashing us?

93
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,792
He can beat an additional 6
members apart from the 6 of us.

94
00:09:21,917 --> 00:09:24,458
Where is this Rudra? What is he doing?

95
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,917
Let’s try one more time.

96
00:09:36,792 --> 00:09:38,083
Hello Rudra!!
-Hello sir?

97
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,417
I need a small favor from you.

98
00:09:39,417 --> 00:09:40,208
Tell me sir.

99
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:42,750
You have an idea about the
research done by Sara, right?

100
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,625
I know, sir.

101
00:09:55,167 --> 00:09:57,750
If you go with them, I will have confidence.

102
00:09:58,167 --> 00:09:58,833
Is it Ok?

103
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:01,417
Sir... but isn’t it risky?

104
00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:02,083
See Rudra...

105
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:05,125
even if it is risky,
it is all for a good cause.

106
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,125
I will take with Sara and others.

107
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,000
Ok.

108
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:11,333
If any problems arise there,
I’ll will take care of them.

109
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,000
But...

110
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,500
you to accompany Sara’s team at any cost.

111
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:15,708
Is it ok?

112
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,542
Ok, sir.

113
00:10:17,167 --> 00:10:18,250
Anything for you.

114
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,125
Sara, I am coming.

115
00:10:28,417 --> 00:10:31,250
even you cannot stop me…
from coming near you…

116
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,667
A bag was there on that day…
flies are swarming around it…

117
00:10:45,667 --> 00:10:47,625
searching what is inside
it… we found a scorpion.

118
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,875
Cracked a big joke??

119
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:49,875
A very big joke?

120
00:10:51,792 --> 00:10:52,833
That day bag…

121
00:10:54,042 --> 00:10:55,458
Hello?
-Hello, sir?

122
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:56,167
Sara...

123
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:57,958
we are doing this.

124
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,750
Yeh… finally…

125
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:02,875
But on one condition…

126
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:03,667
Come on...

127
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,542
wait … wait…

128
00:11:05,542 --> 00:11:06,708
Okay
-Tell sir…

129
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,667
You have to carry this experiment
in the place stipulated by me.

130
00:11:10,667 --> 00:11:12,667
Keep it very confidential…
-Ok…Sure, sir.

131
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:15,000
Whatever happens, it should stay between us?

132
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:16,750
And one more thing…

133
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,458
Rudra will accompany you.

134
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:21,000
Rudra?
-Rudra?

135
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,417
Sara, what happened, Sara?
- Say yes to sir.

136
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:24,750
Sara...

137
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:26,125
are you there?

138
00:11:26,167 --> 00:11:27,875
Hey, tell sir, it’s ok…
-tell ok…tell ok…. Tell ok…

139
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:28,667
Ok, sir.

140
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:29,667
Fine then.

141
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:31,708
I will make all the arrangements you need.

142
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:35,083
Hey, yes man… Yes….
Yes… lets rock it….

143
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,208
Hey, you already arrived…

144
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,292
Hi Rudra…
-Hi Rudra…

145
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:43,125
Rudra!!!

146
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:47,208
I thought someone else would come…
what bro, you came? Go, man…

147
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:49,375
Hey guys….

148
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,458
They might call it Fate …

149
00:11:53,542 --> 00:11:55,833
There is a no connection between
me and your experiment…

150
00:11:56,417 --> 00:11:58,958
but, I am coming with you tomorrow.

151
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:08,208
Hello...
-Hello...

152
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,125
Madam, my name is Vaikuntam.

153
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:11,042
Ok.

154
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:16,500
Madam, I heard your conversation
with your professor, yesterday.

155
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:17,375
What?

156
00:12:18,542 --> 00:12:20,125
Who are you? What do you want?

157
00:12:20,417 --> 00:12:23,667
I am not calling you either to
frighten or to blackmail, madam.

158
00:12:26,042 --> 00:12:27,708
I called you to explain my suffering.

159
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,583
My wife is pregnant.

160
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,000
I recently lost my job.

161
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,542
I don’t have money to buy medicines.

162
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:37,625
When I am clueless about what to do,
I saw you talking to your professor.

163
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,833
With great difficulty,
I found out your number, madam.

164
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:41,125
Now, what do you want?

165
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:45,250
Instead of taking so much risk and
testing on some other person...

166
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,583
please test it on me, madam.

167
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:51,667
Please, help me financially a little bit.

168
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:53,125
I’ll help you.

169
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:57,333
But for that you don’t
need to risk your life.

170
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,542
I have no hope in life, madam.

171
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:05,250
Because, I am going to die in a few days.

172
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,167
What are you saying?

173
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:07,292
Yes!

174
00:13:08,417 --> 00:13:09,583
I have cancer, madam.

175
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:12,875
I don’t know whether I will be alive
or not till my wife’s delivery, madam.

176
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,917
Vaikuntam, I will call you back again.

177
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,083
Ok, madam.

178
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:18,292
Who is he?

179
00:13:19,292 --> 00:13:20,833
Some Viakuntam, it seems.

180
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,333
He says, he has listened to the whole
of my conversation with professor.

181
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:26,000
So, we have to take him with us.

182
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,625
But, can we believe him?

183
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,708
Guys...

184
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:36,875
Professor sir told us to
keep all this secret, right?

185
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:42,042
If we don’t take him with us, there
is chance that information may leak out.

186
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:44,500
After that, it’s up to you.

187
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,833
First call and ask him to come…

188
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:56,083
Hello Madam?

189
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:57,833
Vaikuntam, I will tell you a place…

190
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:58,792
You come over there….

191
00:13:58,792 --> 00:13:59,417
Ok, Madam.

192
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:00,750
Remember!

193
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:02,958
no one should know about this thing.

194
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:03,708
Ok, madam.

195
00:14:08,417 --> 00:14:09,167
Rudra...

196
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:11,125
because of the trust I have on you.
I am taking this risk.

197
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:15,625
To conduct this experiment,
I am sending you all to secluded place.

198
00:14:15,792 --> 00:14:16,542
Okay Sir.

199
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:19,833
Sara told that she needs only
one day for the experiment.

200
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:23,833
I’ll use the body double and
manage the issue for one day.

201
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,833
He is a very notorious criminal.

202
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:27,708
So, please take care of them.

203
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:31,333
If the news is leaked to the media,
we all are finished.

204
00:14:32,917 --> 00:14:34,292
Sure sir. I’ll take care.

205
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:35,708
Good luck.
-Thank you, sir.

206
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,458
He has come not only in
to my personal life...

207
00:14:53,417 --> 00:14:55,375
but has set his foot in
my professional life too.

208
00:14:56,042 --> 00:15:00,833
As the saying goes, the earth is round;
he has come back to me again.

209
00:15:01,417 --> 00:15:02,792
See his style!

210
00:15:03,417 --> 00:15:06,083
Giving buildup as if he is
the savior of this world.

211
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:11,208
Anyhow, why Aditya sir trusts him so much?

212
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:13,542
Won’t leave alone?

213
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,458
Arrogance hasn’t diminished
a wee bit for the jerk.

214
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,583
Oh God!

215
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:38,542
See how he is sitting,
just like a big ruffian?

216
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,250
How I sat doesn't matter?

217
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,167
This ruffian only will rescue you,
every time.

218
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:47,042
I will see,
how many days you won’t talk to me?

219
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:50,083
No remorse that relationship has broken.

220
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,125
If relationship broke, should I feel sorry.

221
00:15:53,042 --> 00:15:56,250
Those days are gone, when men use
to grow beard, because of break up.

222
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:58,000
Can talk, right?

223
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,875
You can talk…. Why so much ego for you?

224
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:06,958
Oh!! Feeling like celestial nymphet.

225
00:16:18,417 --> 00:16:21,000
What?? Where am I?

226
00:16:23,167 --> 00:16:25,250
Who are you all?

227
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,250
Where are you taking me?

228
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,458
Tell me… who are you?

229
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,333
Tell…. Tell me…

230
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,292
Who are you all?

231
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:36,875
Ok… ok…

232
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:39,333
You freak... don't change…

233
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,792
Not like this….
I will put tape on your mouth.

234
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,333
Now, you talk.

235
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:52,833
You...

236
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,917
I will kill you…

237
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:00,250
Had a good slap, huh?

238
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:17,875
Brother, please stop there.

239
00:17:26,917 --> 00:17:27,958
Vaikuntam???

240
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,708
I asked you to come alone, right?
Who is she?

241
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,667
Madam! she is my wife, madam.

242
00:17:33,542 --> 00:17:34,625
She is pregnant.

243
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,875
Apart from me,
she doesn’t have any relations.

244
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,958
Hey bro, we are not going for picnic…

245
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,167
why are you bring whole of your family?

246
00:17:40,167 --> 00:17:41,542
Ok… Get in quickly.

247
00:17:53,417 --> 00:17:54,250
Okay?

248
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,500
Move aside…
-Ok… will move aside…

249
00:17:59,667 --> 00:18:01,542
How many months pregnant?
-7th month, madam.

250
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,417
Why did you bring her at
such a delicate moment?

251
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:09,042
Apart from him, I don’t have anyone in this
world. I didn’t stay alone, without him, ever.

252
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:19,375
You also didn’t like to
stay without me either, right?

253
00:18:58,708 --> 00:18:59,583
Rudra?

254
00:19:00,417 --> 00:19:01,125
Sara??

255
00:19:07,917 --> 00:19:11,708
Because, I didn’t lift your call for 1
hour… you torture my friends with your calls?

256
00:19:11,792 --> 00:19:13,667
I was in library…

257
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:16,500
You always hang out with this useless batch,
right?

258
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,583
Thought you may be with them so,
I called them.

259
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:19,708
What?

260
00:19:19,917 --> 00:19:23,917
don’t have time to take the call
and talk for these useless fellows!

261
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:26,208
Is it?

262
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,458
Wait…then what about this status?

263
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:35,083
My darling went missing for the past 1 hour… If
anyone knows about the whereabouts, please inform me?

264
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,625
What is this, bro?

265
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:39,208
You are disturbing me a lot, Rudra?

266
00:19:39,292 --> 00:19:44,542
Sweetheart, Won’t your mummy call everyone and
inquire, if your daddy won’t receive her calls?

267
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:46,625
Are my mummy and you, one and the same?

268
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,375
Whatever be the relation,
love is same, right?

269
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:50,958
Sweetheart...

270
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,167
If my love is a distraction to you,
tell me, I will never disturb you again.

271
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,375
When did you ever leave me alone?

272
00:19:57,667 --> 00:19:59,500
Within 1 hour after berating you...
you come searching me again.

273
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:05,625
Thinking internet is available for free, don’t
use social media for such petty things, bro.

274
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:06,208
Hey, Go man…

275
00:20:06,917 --> 00:20:07,917
He will not change.

276
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:12,708
I am missing your love.

277
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,708
Aren’t you responsible for all this?

278
00:20:21,792 --> 00:20:22,833
Sara!!!

279
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:27,417
Rudra, what is this? Are you mad?
What’s wrong with you?

280
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:29,917
What’s wrong with me!!!

281
00:20:32,917 --> 00:20:35,167
Does love mean that we have to
always be in each other’s arms?

282
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:39,208
I can’t be like that. I have a goal to
achieve. I can’t set it aside for you.

283
00:20:39,667 --> 00:20:42,292
Ok. Don’t set aside. Now who said that.

284
00:20:42,292 --> 00:20:45,208
I am getting disturbed the way you are tag
along behind me... showering your love.

285
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,250
So, what do you say now?

286
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,125
Please stay away from for few days.

287
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:50,667
Leave me alone.

288
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:54,958
We give our heart to you… you
instead give us the back of your hand.

289
00:20:55,542 --> 00:20:56,375
Good bye.

290
00:21:40,792 --> 00:21:43,167
What is this? They have placed siren here.

291
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
(Song Humming)

292
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,667
Who will bring him?

293
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:58,750
You can bring him….

294
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,958
Nothing…. I will bring him, myself…
-Go.

295
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,250
Shall we get down.
-Ok.

296
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:13,750
Hello Madam.

297
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:17,333
Hello, Sir...
-Hello.

298
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:23,792
Come man…

299
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:25,625
Get up…. Come…

300
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:29,042
Come.

301
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,750
Hi, I am Acharya,
in-charge of this institute…

302
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,583
These are my assistants, Bunty and Chunty…

303
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:34,292
Hi....

304
00:22:35,542 --> 00:22:36,292
Komal...

305
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,042
Hi...

306
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,208
Richi...

307
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:38,625
Hi...

308
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:39,875
Vaikuntam...
-Hi...

309
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:42,375
Priya, Arka, Prabha and...
-Hi...

310
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:44,792
Sara...
-Hello.

311
00:22:45,167 --> 00:22:45,917
Hello.

312
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:47,458
He is Agneya.
-Wait bro…

313
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:51,083
I am Agneya, son of fire…
-What?? He looks different…

314
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:51,917
Can we make a move…?

315
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:56,667
I forgot to ask you bro,
why police siren is here?

316
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,583
Actually, this is an engineering college.

317
00:22:58,708 --> 00:23:02,042
We re-modelling this into a Medical college.
Renovation process is going on.

318
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:05,583
Because it is situated on the city outskirts,
this much of security has become mandatory.

319
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:16,375
Well… this is the locker room.

320
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,083
You all have to hand over your cell phones here.
We don’t allow anyone to carry mobiles inside.

321
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:21,625
And you won’t signal inside.

322
00:23:22,042 --> 00:23:25,583
If you want to call anyone,
you have to call from this landline only…

323
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:29,083
You are telling that there won’t be signal
inside, then why to keep our cell phones here.

324
00:23:29,292 --> 00:23:32,583
Actually, Aditya sir has issued a directive
to collect all your phones and keep them here.

325
00:23:33,917 --> 00:23:34,458
Fine.

326
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:35,458
Guys...

327
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:37,083
take out your mobiles.

328
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,417
And one more important information…

329
00:23:43,542 --> 00:23:48,583
whoever calls whomsoever, their every call gets recorded
here and it will directly get relayed to Aditya sir.

330
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:50,792
Is it? Any more, bro…

331
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:52,750
does even our bathing in the
bathroom gets recorded, huh??

332
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:57,000
Of all the people here… who want see,
you taking a bath? Move…

333
00:23:57,875 --> 00:23:59,458
Don’t want to see your performance, bro…

334
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:02,833
We are here to give performance, bro….
take it… let’s move.

335
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:07,875
Aditya sir has made all the necessary
arrangements you may require.

336
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:11,708
Especially, he has asked you
monitor that criminal very strictly.

337
00:24:11,708 --> 00:24:12,375
Okay.

338
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:14,208
Let’s move… we will see the lab.

339
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:20,292
Come,
man… you have become my inamorata….

340
00:24:22,792 --> 00:24:25,875
We, ourselves have arranged everything
that you need for your experiment.

341
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:26,917
And he is Pavan.

342
00:24:27,167 --> 00:24:28,042
Hi....
-Hi...

343
00:24:28,042 --> 00:24:31,375
Whatever lab equipment you may need further for
your experiment, he will assist you with that?

344
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:32,750
Then who are these people?

345
00:24:32,792 --> 00:24:34,917
They are my assistants. Tittu and Phani.

346
00:24:34,917 --> 00:24:35,708
Hi…
-Hi, sir…

347
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:43,500
What is the next step, bro?
-Why are you still dragging him behind you?

348
00:24:43,542 --> 00:24:46,875
Go tie him up there and come…
-Why?? You want freshen up….

349
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,625
Nothing, we will tie him and come…

350
00:24:49,708 --> 00:24:50,667
You come man.

351
00:24:56,292 --> 00:24:59,125
You come man… you are bothering
me from morning onwards.

352
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:00,375
You Idiot.

353
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:03,458
come…. come…

354
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:06,833
Move.

355
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,500
Give the rope….
-Take it.

356
00:25:15,833 --> 00:25:16,958
What...?

357
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,500
He seems to have so much strength…

358
00:25:28,833 --> 00:25:29,500
Go.

359
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:36,833
Okay.

360
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:39,583
Hey...

361
00:25:40,042 --> 00:25:42,708
will you complete it today?
How long will you do it?

362
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:44,250
I’ll complete it today, Madam.

363
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:46,208
Ooh…angry for questioning.

364
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:47,625
Old woman is nagging always….

365
00:25:47,833 --> 00:25:51,542
Hey you… will you just keeping rotating???
flies will go inside…close your mouth.

366
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,458
I have employed morons… I
have to do everything, myself.

367
00:25:55,667 --> 00:25:57,125
Snacks… any item….

368
00:25:57,125 --> 00:25:59,000
You can order your favorite food without hesitation…
-Looks its very big canteen…

369
00:25:59,375 --> 00:26:01,417
Guys. She is Satyabhama…
-Idiot?

370
00:26:01,958 --> 00:26:03,458
the cook, who prepares food for us.

371
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:05,833
Satyabhama ma’am, I told you already….
These are the people.

372
00:26:05,833 --> 00:26:07,167
Hello grandma…

373
00:26:07,167 --> 00:26:08,792
What??? Grandma?? You black fellow.

374
00:26:08,792 --> 00:26:12,583
Not black fellow…. Agneya, son of fire.

375
00:26:13,167 --> 00:26:17,458
Anyway... how come they christened you,
away from the present trend, as Agneya?

376
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:19,875
He has turned black because
of that fire only…

377
00:26:20,917 --> 00:26:23,417
Ok… Ok… there are
some restrictions here.

378
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:25,458
I love neatness very much.

379
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,333
I don’t even come out of the room, fearing
that there won’t be neatness outside.

380
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:32,750
I even divorced my husband,
as he didn’t maintained orderliness.

381
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:36,625
Till the time you are here,
you have to maintain cleanliness. Got it.

382
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,458
Grandma, your OCD reached peaks.

383
00:26:39,667 --> 00:26:44,250
Hey Black fellow, not Grandma….
Call me Satyabhama.

384
00:26:44,458 --> 00:26:46,750
Pronounce 'Bha...'

385
00:26:47,583 --> 00:26:48,375
Okay.

386
00:26:48,583 --> 00:26:54,250
Ok. If you want anything, inform my assistants. They
will in turn inform me and I’ll prepare the food.

387
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:56,833
Once I finish preparing, I’ll inform you.
Then come and eat.

388
00:26:57,125 --> 00:26:58,583
Understood? Ok. Let’s move…

389
00:26:58,917 --> 00:26:59,542
Good.

390
00:27:01,708 --> 00:27:06,833
Hey bro, do you need all these arrangements
and build up for your trivial experiment?

391
00:27:07,458 --> 00:27:10,250
Idiot…
-It’s Ok… come.

392
00:27:38,375 --> 00:27:40,417
If temperature is normal, we can proceed.

393
00:27:41,583 --> 00:27:43,000
We have virus ready.

394
00:27:43,375 --> 00:27:44,292
Hah… Ok….

395
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,000
Is everything ok?
-Perfect.

396
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,875
Yaa…

397
00:27:51,625 --> 00:27:54,583
So, guys first we will administer
this immunity booster to him.

398
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:57,708
After 20 minutes,
we will inject virus into his body.

399
00:27:57,708 --> 00:27:58,917
Ok Ok…

400
00:28:17,125 --> 00:28:21,500
Shut up your mouth...

401
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:25,875
Why did you bring me here? Tell me….
Tell me…. Said death by hanging….

402
00:28:25,875 --> 00:28:30,000
What is this punishment to me???

403
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,875
This is not a punishment…. It is our
benefaction to wipe a little of your sin.

404
00:28:33,875 --> 00:28:36,958
Benefaction??? What are you talking?

405
00:28:37,417 --> 00:28:40,167
I am petrified…please
untie me… please…

406
00:28:40,167 --> 00:28:42,750
please take me to jail… please… please.

407
00:28:43,083 --> 00:28:47,125
Go and shut his mouth…
-Take me….

408
00:28:49,125 --> 00:28:51,083
Hey… Hey… what are you doing? Kill him?

409
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:52,875
Bro, it seems he is going to kill him.

410
00:28:53,208 --> 00:28:57,250
Hey…. hey…. I asked you shut
his mouth…. Not kill him…

411
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,917
plastering a tape over
his mouth will be enough.

412
00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:04,625
Come….

413
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:23,208
I feel very apprehensive… I don’t
understand what they are doing….

414
00:29:24,208 --> 00:29:25,625
Don’t worry…. Ok.

415
00:29:27,417 --> 00:29:30,333
So, Guys, I think it’s the
time to inject the virus now.

416
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,208
So, Guys, let’s wait for the
results until tomorrow morning.

417
00:30:17,625 --> 00:30:21,958
Hey, what is that eating, as if the
world’s entire famine is in your plate?

418
00:30:22,375 --> 00:30:24,000
No one will snatch your plate from you.

419
00:30:24,875 --> 00:30:26,542
At least wipe your mouth…

420
00:30:26,542 --> 00:30:26,958
No…

421
00:30:28,417 --> 00:30:29,292
Nasty fellow.

422
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:31,667
Hey, Jeshu, serve the food….

423
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,208
Sidhu, serve water to all….

424
00:30:35,958 --> 00:30:37,958
Hey, serve to that pregnant lady…
-Ok Madam…

425
00:30:41,208 --> 00:30:43,458
Eat to your utmost satisfaction….
And eat in pleasing manner.

426
00:30:43,458 --> 00:30:44,083
Very delicious….

427
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:45,583
psst…this disgusting fellow…

428
00:30:46,042 --> 00:30:48,542
Ma’am, can you serve some sambhar, please…
-Sure… I will bring it…

429
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:51,708
Serve it, bro…

430
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:41,958
Rudra, I want to talk to you…

431
00:31:42,625 --> 00:31:44,708
-Aah…Tell…

432
00:31:45,167 --> 00:31:47,083
Not here… come outside…

433
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:14,083
If I said, get out in a fit of moment… will you really
break our relationship and disappear from my life…

434
00:32:14,375 --> 00:32:19,750
That day, when I didn’t talk to you for just 1
hour, you called all my friends and harassed them.

435
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,292
Is all that a hogwash?

436
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:25,042
Are all you boys like that?

437
00:32:26,208 --> 00:32:29,875
Always big on promises and tall
talk… but forget very easily.

438
00:32:31,667 --> 00:32:36,167
Even now, when I am speaking all this,
you are not able to understand my feelings…

439
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,625
When you say get out…
we have to go and again...

440
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:44,833
when you seek us…we have come, right?

441
00:32:48,125 --> 00:32:49,042
Don’t cry…

442
00:32:50,667 --> 00:32:51,542
Don’t cry…

443
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,125
You coward….

444
00:33:02,708 --> 00:33:03,667
What happened??

445
00:33:04,458 --> 00:33:05,667
What happened? Tell…

446
00:33:07,208 --> 00:33:09,208
What happened?
-He screamed, bro…

447
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,375
Hey black fellow, why did you scream?

448
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:17,333
What is this? Remove your hand…

449
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:22,208
We have all submitted our
mobiles at the locker room.

450
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:23,500
Then what is this??

451
00:33:23,667 --> 00:33:25,417
This is...

452
00:33:26,167 --> 00:33:28,792
This is another phone… brought
along with me to view movies.

453
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:32,625
There will be no signal here… then
how did you think of seeing movies here.

454
00:33:32,625 --> 00:33:37,000
Not to waste mobile data,
I downloaded movies using wi-fi at home.

455
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,125
Hence, able to see movies…

456
00:33:38,208 --> 00:33:42,208
Enough of viewing movies… Now
sleep… We have a lot of work tomorrow.

457
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:44,542
Good night, bro…
-Fine, bro…

458
00:33:44,542 --> 00:33:46,792
If this fellow does any extra things,
give him a tight slap.

459
00:33:46,792 --> 00:33:47,667
Good night, bro.

460
00:33:48,417 --> 00:33:49,625
You??? Now go to sleep…

461
00:33:50,458 --> 00:33:53,292
All because of this fellow.

462
00:33:58,667 --> 00:34:03,250
We would have married happily…
She has brought me here…

463
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,583
What insanity she has for these experiments?

464
00:34:08,792 --> 00:34:12,917
At last, she has made me watchman….
All fate…

465
00:35:47,333 --> 00:35:49,083
Good Morning, sir….
-Good Morning…

466
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,833
Wow!!! How sexy is the girl?
-She is very hot….

467
00:35:59,583 --> 00:36:01,625
You rogues’ …wait I am coming…

468
00:36:02,292 --> 00:36:09,708
Wow!! Wow!! Sexy!!
Feels the urge to eat her…

469
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:11,042
Damn!

470
00:36:12,417 --> 00:36:15,792
Rudra, please help me a little.

471
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,833
She says no one should disturb any one…

472
00:36:27,625 --> 00:36:29,833
but she disturbs everyone…

473
00:36:29,833 --> 00:36:30,583
-What???

474
00:36:31,292 --> 00:36:32,042
Nothing…

475
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:36,625
Looking at them, don’t you reminisce,
we were like them once.

476
00:36:36,708 --> 00:36:37,500
Right.

477
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,750
Where is every one?

478
00:36:40,125 --> 00:36:42,292
Duh… no one has any responsibility?

479
00:36:42,375 --> 00:36:46,417
I have to look after everything. I am waiting for the
experimental result…seems no one else is interested…

480
00:36:46,417 --> 00:36:48,125
Aah…what did you say?

481
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:50,750
Nothing… thinking of going upstairs.

482
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:55,417
Hey Viakuntam, sitting leisurely and talking, huh?
-Wait… one second…

483
00:36:55,417 --> 00:36:56,750
Ok. Let’s move, sir… One second…

484
00:36:56,917 --> 00:36:58,542
you go to room… I’ll come just now.

485
00:36:58,708 --> 00:37:00,000
You come, man.

486
00:37:00,625 --> 00:37:08,542
Hey, how sexy is she? How curvaceous her
waist is? He has come and disturbed us…

487
00:37:08,917 --> 00:37:11,417
Hey, what are you doing all of you?
What work you have with these people, go?

488
00:37:11,417 --> 00:37:12,542
Ok, sir.

489
00:37:12,958 --> 00:37:14,542
Guys, what I told you to do?

490
00:37:14,542 --> 00:37:15,167
Out.

491
00:37:15,167 --> 00:37:15,750
Oh my God!!!

492
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:16,583
Ok, sir.

493
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,667
You come with me…
-Umm…

494
00:37:21,208 --> 00:37:23,000
However criminal he may be…
he is also a human, right?

495
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,042
Doesn’t he feel urge to
go to toilet in the morning.

496
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:26,708
What to do? I have to look out everything.

497
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,167
Yoo… you come, man.

498
00:37:30,208 --> 00:37:31,708
I am coming… you proceed, sir.

499
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:37,208
Who are you?
Haven’t seen you the whole of yesterday.

500
00:37:37,208 --> 00:37:38,625
I am a peon here, sir.

501
00:37:38,625 --> 00:37:41,125
Had to drink a little because
of heavy work in the night, sir.

502
00:37:41,333 --> 00:37:42,875
So, slept yesterday, sir.

503
00:37:42,875 --> 00:37:44,875
Ok. I have a lot of work for you.
Come with me…

504
00:37:44,875 --> 00:37:47,208
Ok, sir…
-Come quickly, man….

505
00:37:47,208 --> 00:37:48,292
You come…

506
00:38:46,042 --> 00:38:47,083
Hey what is his problem?

507
00:38:47,083 --> 00:38:48,833
You untie those knots…
-Ok, sir…

508
00:38:52,292 --> 00:38:55,458
What man, you have more black than me?

509
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:58,625
What happened to those eyes?
They have become so white…

510
00:39:10,542 --> 00:39:11,542
Move… Move, bro…

511
00:39:11,542 --> 00:39:12,000
What happened, bro?

512
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,625
Our experiment failed, bro…

513
00:39:13,875 --> 00:39:15,083
Let’s run from here, bro…

514
00:39:43,542 --> 00:39:46,250
Oh my God!!! What is happening here?

515
00:40:00,708 --> 00:40:01,875
Did you see those legs?

516
00:40:01,875 --> 00:40:03,583
Wow!! She is in different league…

517
00:40:03,583 --> 00:40:06,125
Did you see her structure?Unnecessarily,
-He came at right time and disturbed everything.

518
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,375
What..? let's go... run...

519
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:27,417
What is happening, sir?

520
00:40:28,208 --> 00:40:29,542
Actually, what did they do, sir?

521
00:40:30,625 --> 00:40:33,375
Hey, first we will escape from here…
-Ok, sir…

522
00:40:33,375 --> 00:40:33,958
Come…

523
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
-Sara, let’s run…

524
00:41:18,125 --> 00:41:19,292
Priya, come….

525
00:41:23,375 --> 00:41:24,042
Come…

526
00:41:27,292 --> 00:41:30,708
What is this all, sir?
-I too don’t understand what is happening?

527
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,708
Sir, my husband…

528
00:41:34,542 --> 00:41:37,625
Don’t worry… nothing will
happen to him… you stay here.

529
00:42:01,875 --> 00:42:02,667
Come on...

530
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,167
Hey, who are you?

531
00:42:27,125 --> 00:42:30,333
What is the matter? Go from here…

532
00:42:44,583 --> 00:42:46,125
What is this?

533
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,917
Are they humans or daemons?

534
00:42:49,208 --> 00:42:51,208
Why are they chomping on
human flesh like that?

535
00:42:52,333 --> 00:42:54,667
I don’t know, bro…

536
00:42:57,708 --> 00:43:02,083
We have to go silently into that room.

537
00:43:03,375 --> 00:43:08,125
If we stay here for some more time,
we will also become like them.

538
00:43:12,958 --> 00:43:13,958
Hey ditto...

539
00:43:16,375 --> 00:43:19,792
without catching their attention,
you go to that room.

540
00:43:20,833 --> 00:43:22,667
We will all come behind you.

541
00:43:23,583 --> 00:43:27,375
What, if I walk in front,
you will all follow me?

542
00:43:27,375 --> 00:43:30,500
It seems you have decided
that it will kill me.

543
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,333
Nothing will happen to you.

544
00:43:33,167 --> 00:43:34,667
Oh God! There is no other way.

545
00:43:50,083 --> 00:43:51,500
Now you go madam.

546
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:58,833
I won’t go… I am afraid.

547
00:43:59,917 --> 00:44:01,458
I can’t go.

548
00:44:03,667 --> 00:44:06,375
When life is at stake,
you have pull up yourself, madam.

549
00:44:06,792 --> 00:44:08,667
Staying here for some
more time is dangerous.

550
00:44:08,833 --> 00:44:10,167
Please go…

551
00:44:10,417 --> 00:44:11,500
Go...

552
00:44:11,917 --> 00:44:13,958
We will come behind you…

553
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,000
You go first….

554
00:44:44,042 --> 00:44:44,667
Let's go.

555
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:02,792
Sara…

556
00:45:04,833 --> 00:45:05,625
Sara…

557
00:45:05,958 --> 00:45:06,708
Sara…

558
00:45:07,333 --> 00:45:08,792
What is happening actually, Sara?

559
00:45:09,667 --> 00:45:12,083
I am sorry Rudra. I am really sorry.

560
00:45:12,667 --> 00:45:14,500
All this happened because of me.

561
00:45:15,542 --> 00:45:19,000
I don’t understand what is happening.

562
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:20,333
What are you talking, Sara?

563
00:45:21,125 --> 00:45:21,958
Because of me…

564
00:45:22,833 --> 00:45:24,208
you are all here … like this…

565
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:26,833
please forgive me.

566
00:45:31,458 --> 00:45:33,917
Oh my God!!! What is happening here?

567
00:45:39,708 --> 00:45:41,750
Oh my God!!! He also changed.

568
00:45:54,208 --> 00:45:54,958
Tell Sara…

569
00:45:55,292 --> 00:45:58,167
I just wanted to speak to you about the
research I have submitted to you, sir.

570
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:02,667
Your idea of immunity booster, so that people will
not get affected by contagious diseases, is very good.

571
00:46:02,833 --> 00:46:03,750
It’s a great idea.

572
00:46:03,833 --> 00:46:06,917
Thank you very much, sir.
But only you can help us take this forward.

573
00:46:06,917 --> 00:46:07,583
Definitely.

574
00:46:07,583 --> 00:46:12,375
We are thinking of going ahead with testing this
immunity booster on humans instead of animals.

575
00:46:12,375 --> 00:46:14,167
What??? Human trials???

576
00:46:14,167 --> 00:46:16,000
Sara,
don’t you that it will be a big problem?

577
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:19,625
Sir, we are not planning to conduct
this experiment on common people.

578
00:46:19,625 --> 00:46:21,250
We want to test it on criminals.

579
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:22,208
-On criminals???

580
00:46:22,208 --> 00:46:23,042
Yes, sir.

581
00:46:23,042 --> 00:46:28,250
It is correct to test it on these savage
beasts instead of those docile animals.

582
00:46:29,667 --> 00:46:30,625
What is your plan, Sara?

583
00:46:30,625 --> 00:46:35,625
I am thinking of doing this test on a rape convict awaiting death penalty,
who is undergoing medical treatment in our hospital from you, sir.

584
00:46:35,625 --> 00:46:36,458
No way Sara.

585
00:46:37,708 --> 00:46:39,250
Sir. Think once sir.

586
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:44,000
if he is not merciless bloody thirsty beast, will he commit
such an atrocious crime on helpless lady and murder her.

587
00:46:44,625 --> 00:46:50,042
Is it justifiable to feed such callous persons 3 times
a day and then take away their life without much pain?

588
00:46:50,042 --> 00:46:53,333
And some other weird judgements
are life imprisonments.

589
00:46:54,375 --> 00:46:57,625
We are taking very good care
these beasts till they are alive.

590
00:46:57,625 --> 00:47:01,500
At least for these kinds of experiments,
let’s use these criminals, sir.

591
00:47:02,292 --> 00:47:06,708
In this way, we will be giving them a chance to
redeem their sins and benefit mankind at large, sir.

592
00:47:06,708 --> 00:47:07,708
Please sir.

593
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:11,250
See Sara, I understood your point.

594
00:47:11,625 --> 00:47:16,125
But we may have to face many complications
and practical problems with this approach.

595
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:19,042
By the way,
how you want to execute this project?

596
00:47:19,042 --> 00:47:22,708
Sir, first we will give him immunity
booster that we have developed.

597
00:47:22,708 --> 00:47:25,833
After 20 minutes,
we will inject virus into his body.

598
00:47:25,833 --> 00:47:30,500
We will know whether the immunity booster
is working or not in 15- 16 hours.

599
00:47:30,708 --> 00:47:34,417
Till then we have to keep him in observation.
-Suppose, if that test fails…

600
00:47:36,333 --> 00:47:39,125
The person, who is supposed to die 10th,
will die two days earlier than that.

601
00:47:40,333 --> 00:47:44,958
Sir, even if dies, I know you can handle this
situation. That’s why, I approached you.

602
00:47:46,292 --> 00:47:46,833
Ok, Sara.

603
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:48,208
Let me think.

604
00:47:48,625 --> 00:47:50,833
But I want some time.
-Ok, sir.

605
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,250
I committed a mistake, Rudra.

606
00:48:00,833 --> 00:48:03,167
Sara,
you thought of doing good to the society.

607
00:48:03,625 --> 00:48:06,958
But unexpectedly, things have taken a
different turn… It is not your fault.

608
00:48:11,208 --> 00:48:12,875
Can we do anything to control this?

609
00:48:16,792 --> 00:48:17,292
Sir…

610
00:48:18,083 --> 00:48:21,708
Sir!!! open the door, sir…open sir…

611
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:22,750
Open sir.

612
00:49:06,667 --> 00:49:08,458
Hey bunty…
-Tell sir…

613
00:49:08,625 --> 00:49:11,125
All these days I have been
providing you livelihood and food.

614
00:49:11,125 --> 00:49:15,292
If any untoward thing happens,
will you sacrifice your life for mine.

615
00:49:15,417 --> 00:49:16,708
I’ll do anything for you, sir.

616
00:49:17,042 --> 00:49:19,458
Then why are you behind me…
come and be in front of me.

617
00:49:19,458 --> 00:49:21,000
No…. I am afraid…

618
00:49:21,417 --> 00:49:22,542
Duh…rascal…

619
00:49:47,625 --> 00:49:48,542
Come out.

620
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:52,458
Hey, in such a big building,
you found only this restroom to hide.

621
00:50:52,458 --> 00:50:54,458
The smell is stifling from the morning…

622
00:50:54,458 --> 00:50:55,375
Let’s move from here…

623
00:50:55,375 --> 00:50:57,625
Sir! no… If we go out we will die, sir.

624
00:50:57,958 --> 00:51:01,583
Don’t know whether they will kill us or
not. But this obnoxious smell is killing, man.

625
00:51:01,583 --> 00:51:03,333
Hey, move man.
-Sir! No…sir.

626
00:51:03,333 --> 00:51:04,333
Let’s move.

627
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:11,458
Sara…

628
00:51:14,333 --> 00:51:15,125
Don’t cry…

629
00:51:19,417 --> 00:51:20,125
Sara…

630
00:51:50,958 --> 00:51:52,458
I am still alive?

631
00:51:54,917 --> 00:51:56,042
You are alive, Ok?

632
00:51:57,875 --> 00:51:59,708
All this happened because of me.

633
00:52:00,042 --> 00:52:02,625
Without informing you,
I had removed his shackles.

634
00:52:03,875 --> 00:52:05,125
First stop crying and sit down.

635
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:11,083
Without heeding to Aditya sir’s warning, I brought
all of you here, with the intention to do human trials.

636
00:52:12,958 --> 00:52:13,917
Ok.

637
00:52:14,833 --> 00:52:17,500
I am responsible for this mishap.
Very sorry…

638
00:52:18,208 --> 00:52:20,125
Don’t think of what had happened…

639
00:52:22,583 --> 00:52:24,250
Let’s think what we can do now.

640
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:32,125
First you stop crying, else I’ll kill
you before those zombies attack you.

641
00:52:32,125 --> 00:52:32,958
Zombies?

642
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:36,000
What are Zombies, sir?

643
00:52:41,833 --> 00:52:44,583
Nothing…the experiment,
these people conducted failed.

644
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:47,875
That criminal died as a result of test
failure and now he is killing everyone.

645
00:52:47,875 --> 00:52:50,583
You said he and others died…
but they are killing us….

646
00:52:50,583 --> 00:52:52,042
I am unable to understand it, sir.

647
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:54,792
Though they may look as
if they are living….

648
00:52:55,708 --> 00:52:56,917
actually, they are dead.

649
00:52:58,792 --> 00:53:00,292
Even after death….

650
00:53:01,917 --> 00:53:04,583
the inability to think or speak.

651
00:53:05,333 --> 00:53:07,000
insatiable hunger...

652
00:53:09,292 --> 00:53:11,417
incessant urge to kill other
living beings and eat...

653
00:53:12,875 --> 00:53:17,000
are some of the characteristics of Zombies.

654
00:53:17,667 --> 00:53:18,833
What shall we do now?

655
00:53:24,042 --> 00:53:25,083
Should escape.

656
00:53:27,458 --> 00:53:28,708
We have to stay away from them...

657
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:32,500
and need to protect ourselves from them.

658
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,042
Sir! Grandma is alone on the top floor, sir.

659
00:53:35,833 --> 00:53:37,750
We have to rescue grandma at any
cost from these zombies, sir.

660
00:53:48,042 --> 00:53:49,667
Priya is in danger...

661
00:53:50,417 --> 00:53:52,833
You guys are go to upstairs and
Keep Grandma in a safe room.

662
00:53:52,833 --> 00:53:53,333
Okay Sir.

663
00:53:53,333 --> 00:53:54,875
I will come there with Priya.
-Okay.

664
00:55:18,125 --> 00:55:18,750
Priya????

665
00:55:38,042 --> 00:55:39,125
Hey Bunty…

666
00:55:40,292 --> 00:55:41,167
Hey Bunty…

667
00:55:42,958 --> 00:55:44,042
Hey Bunty… Get up.

668
00:55:44,667 --> 00:55:47,042
Bunty, what is all this?

669
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:49,792
Bunty, what happened, man?

670
00:56:16,583 --> 00:56:19,250
Vaikuntam… You go
upstairs along with Priya.

671
00:56:31,708 --> 00:56:33,208
Priya…Priya…

672
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:36,917
Vaikuntam…

673
00:57:57,625 --> 00:57:59,583
SIr... sir... He is coming.

674
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,375
Sir, run.

675
00:58:39,958 --> 00:58:44,292
Whatever, Satyabhama has to do… and
it should be neat, this is the norm.

676
00:58:57,333 --> 00:58:59,083
Hey, who are you?

677
00:58:59,333 --> 00:59:01,333
I haven’t seen you around here. Who??

678
00:59:02,125 --> 00:59:05,083
Do you have something in your mouth?
Why are you not talking?

679
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:07,292
The way grandma talks,
even humans think of killing her.

680
00:59:07,292 --> 00:59:08,625
Why will this zombie leave her out?

681
00:59:08,625 --> 00:59:10,958
What is that dress you are
wearing as if coming from a jail?

682
00:59:11,083 --> 00:59:13,875
You gluttonous,
didn’t I tell you to eat in a proper way?

683
00:59:13,875 --> 00:59:15,375
What is that sauce on you?

684
00:59:15,375 --> 00:59:16,792
Why are you coming this way?

685
00:59:18,667 --> 00:59:19,292
Madam...

686
00:59:51,875 --> 00:59:56,292
Aforetime you told that you will
sacrifice your life for mine, right?

687
00:59:56,917 --> 00:59:59,833
What happened now? Why you have so much
hostility towards me now, you scumbag?

688
01:00:00,375 --> 01:00:01,958
Go, man…. Go.

689
01:00:34,042 --> 01:00:35,875
Oh God! I screwed.

690
01:00:39,042 --> 01:00:40,583
Even after death also,
she is not leaving me….

691
01:00:50,708 --> 01:00:54,167
Oh my God!!
She is not an ordinary old woman.

692
01:01:03,958 --> 01:01:05,083
Stop you... Old hag.

693
01:01:16,542 --> 01:01:19,583
What happened, Priya….
let’s move Priya….

694
01:01:21,958 --> 01:01:27,792
Oh my God!! As if one is not enough…. He is bringing
2 more zombies with him, this way…. I’ll kill you.

695
01:01:28,833 --> 01:01:32,000
Nothing will happen Priya… keep moving…

696
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,833
Lets’ move…. Let’s move…

697
01:01:36,583 --> 01:01:38,375
Move fast…quick…. Move.

698
01:01:40,875 --> 01:01:41,792
Move…

699
01:02:04,375 --> 01:02:05,333
Guys fast.

700
01:02:10,125 --> 01:02:10,875
Come fast.

701
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,708
Guys fast, they are coming….

702
01:02:18,958 --> 01:02:21,083
Keep moving,
ma’am… move quickly… move quickly…

703
01:02:21,083 --> 01:02:22,250
Come fast.

704
01:02:23,792 --> 01:02:26,000
Fast… come on...

705
01:02:31,542 --> 01:02:32,417
Guys fast…

706
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:35,125
move quickly…

707
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:18,292
Even in such a precarious situation and
time also, what is this romance, bro.

708
01:03:18,333 --> 01:03:19,958
It is better to die than watch this romance.

709
01:04:36,058 --> 01:04:39,058
What bro? What are you doing?

710
01:04:58,642 --> 01:05:02,100
Shh… they can’t see in the darkness.

711
01:05:02,850 --> 01:05:04,392
They are moving based upon sound.

712
01:05:06,058 --> 01:05:09,642
So... we have to go to any safe place now,
without making any noise.

713
01:06:02,350 --> 01:06:03,308
Rudra.

714
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:08,725
you told that they can’t see in darkness,
then how did they follow us?

715
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:15,058
I think…they followed
the sound of our footsteps.

716
01:06:16,683 --> 01:06:22,017
When we stopped running,
the sound of our footsteps, also stopped.

717
01:06:22,558 --> 01:06:27,975
In the absence of sound,
when they were confused where to go...

718
01:06:28,475 --> 01:06:30,517
some sound emanated from ground
level at the same time...

719
01:06:32,267 --> 01:06:34,100
So, they all went there.

720
01:06:34,308 --> 01:06:36,392
Sir, what do we do now sir?

721
01:06:36,808 --> 01:06:42,808
If anyone else is also surviving somewhere like us, how
will come to know that they can’t see in darkness?

722
01:06:43,142 --> 01:06:45,225
Yes, how will they come to know?

723
01:06:46,433 --> 01:06:49,100
I will go and tell them
-Is it necessary to take so much risk?

724
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:50,558
We came out of jaws of the death now.

725
01:06:50,558 --> 01:06:52,558
My heart is beating at the rate 102.

726
01:06:52,558 --> 01:06:56,058
Let’s all leave this place as soon as
possible, as they cannot see in the night.

727
01:06:56,058 --> 01:06:58,517
Why should we bother about what
happens to others? Let’s go.

728
01:07:03,683 --> 01:07:05,100
You are always like this.

729
01:07:07,475 --> 01:07:08,642
Rudra...

730
01:07:11,767 --> 01:07:13,017
you don’t go.

731
01:07:19,350 --> 01:07:20,600
Be careful please.

732
01:09:19,808 --> 01:09:21,433
What happened to all of them?

733
01:09:45,183 --> 01:09:46,850
Why is no one traceable?

734
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:51,100
Are they alive?

735
01:09:52,058 --> 01:09:57,892
If they are alive how to communicate to them
that these creatures cannot see in the night.

736
01:10:23,558 --> 01:10:24,683
All of you listen to me.

737
01:10:25,642 --> 01:10:27,642
These zombies cannot see in the night.

738
01:10:28,350 --> 01:10:30,308
They are moving depending upon sound.

739
01:10:31,850 --> 01:10:41,850
If anybody is hiding anywhere, please come
to room no. 202, remember don’t make sound.

740
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:45,433
He tells us not to scream.
Then why is he screaming now?

741
01:10:48,808 --> 01:10:52,767
Madam, did you listen.
They can’t see in the darkness.

742
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:55,725
We will go upstairs slowly. Come on.

743
01:10:56,183 --> 01:10:58,933
No… I won’t come, I am afraid.

744
01:11:06,017 --> 01:11:08,392
If we don’t go now, we can never go.

745
01:11:09,183 --> 01:11:12,267
Even then we will die. Please listen to me.

746
01:11:12,892 --> 01:11:14,725
Will go slowly, let’s go Madam.

747
01:11:15,558 --> 01:11:16,767
Please.

748
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:29,017
Somehow we should escape from them.

749
01:12:02,850 --> 01:12:03,517
Madam...

750
01:12:11,392 --> 01:12:12,267
Madam, you go.

751
01:12:39,517 --> 01:12:42,225
Hey, what you all did?

752
01:12:42,767 --> 01:12:45,350
You killed everyone.
-Calm down … please calm down, Sir.

753
01:12:46,350 --> 01:12:48,850
It’s not his fault. I did this experiment.

754
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:51,517
It’s not the time to argue
whose fault it is and fight.

755
01:12:52,017 --> 01:12:55,600
We now have to think how to get out of here.

756
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:57,642
Seriously, can we escape from them?

757
01:12:58,558 --> 01:13:01,017
How many exits are there for this building?

758
01:13:01,017 --> 01:13:02,808
Only one… entry and one exit.

759
01:13:03,058 --> 01:13:08,100
We don’t have the option to even jump over the gate.
We have only one option that is search for the key.

760
01:13:08,517 --> 01:13:11,017
Now where are the keys?
-Watchman will have the keys.

761
01:13:11,017 --> 01:13:12,183
Oh god!

762
01:13:12,433 --> 01:13:15,433
Is there any spare key?
-Bunty only knows about it.

763
01:13:15,433 --> 01:13:19,767
Somehow,
we should get that key from the watchman.

764
01:13:20,142 --> 01:13:22,600
He is not now a human being to give the key,
the moment we ask him.

765
01:13:22,892 --> 01:13:24,225
Who will take that risk?

766
01:13:25,683 --> 01:13:27,475
Why are you looking at me? I will not go.

767
01:13:27,642 --> 01:13:29,267
If you want, you take the risk.

768
01:13:29,517 --> 01:13:32,808
In the position we are in now… we will die,
if we don’t take risk.

769
01:13:33,725 --> 01:13:36,850
If we take risk,
then we will have outside chance to survive.

770
01:13:38,308 --> 01:13:40,767
Knowing fully well,
who will volunteer to die?

771
01:13:46,308 --> 01:13:47,475
Sir, I will go.

772
01:13:48,850 --> 01:13:51,725
No Viakuntam, you stay here.

773
01:13:52,933 --> 01:13:54,392
He and I will go.

774
01:13:54,392 --> 01:13:56,308
Oh my God!! he won’t leave me.

775
01:13:59,350 --> 01:14:02,933
You both go to locker
room and contact Aditya..

776
01:14:03,767 --> 01:14:09,558
Tell him what has happened
and search for spare key.

777
01:14:09,558 --> 01:14:10,267
Okay.

778
01:14:10,267 --> 01:14:15,225
In case we won’t come,
at lease you may escape from here.

779
01:14:15,808 --> 01:14:17,017
Come on.
-Rudra...

780
01:14:17,017 --> 01:14:19,433
He will kill me today.

781
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:38,100
Come... slowly.

782
01:14:59,767 --> 01:15:01,017
I have a doubt.

783
01:15:03,058 --> 01:15:03,767
What?

784
01:15:04,058 --> 01:15:08,933
If anyone provokes you a little, you act
aggressively like a cobra, ready to strike...

785
01:15:08,933 --> 01:15:12,433
but now, when he held you by the scruff
of the neck, you remained silent.

786
01:15:12,517 --> 01:15:14,142
Is all this necessary now? Let’s move.

787
01:15:14,142 --> 01:15:17,517
No, you should tell me.
If I die suddenly, I will miss the clarity.

788
01:15:22,933 --> 01:15:27,892
If you set aside who has committed the mistake…
who is responsible for this? We all are.

789
01:15:28,767 --> 01:15:31,017
We are responsible for the
death of all these people.

790
01:15:33,058 --> 01:15:35,017
That’s why I remained silent.

791
01:15:35,350 --> 01:15:38,933
Otherwise I would have blasted that fellow.

792
01:15:38,933 --> 01:15:39,767
Let’s move.

793
01:15:44,017 --> 01:15:44,767
Come on…

794
01:15:52,392 --> 01:15:53,850
Where did they all go, bro?

795
01:15:56,975 --> 01:15:58,392
You collect those bottles.

796
01:16:01,225 --> 01:16:04,350
He asked me to take the bottles.
Don’t know what he is planning?

797
01:16:20,725 --> 01:16:21,808
Where are they?

798
01:16:22,475 --> 01:16:24,767
If any sound emanates, they should all come.

799
01:16:26,058 --> 01:16:27,433
Where are they?

800
01:16:32,433 --> 01:16:33,267
Viakuntam…

801
01:16:34,183 --> 01:16:40,225
Aah… Priya… Priya… Priya,
what happened?

802
01:16:40,225 --> 01:16:42,433
Viakuntam, what happened?
-Priya… Priya…

803
01:16:45,225 --> 01:16:46,642
I think she is in labor pains.

804
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:48,600
Priya… Priya…

805
01:16:48,892 --> 01:16:51,100
Priya… Priya…

806
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:53,725
Don’t scream…. Don’t cry.

807
01:16:54,017 --> 01:16:54,683
Priya...

808
01:16:54,933 --> 01:16:56,017
Try to control.

809
01:16:56,225 --> 01:16:58,350
You please shut her mouth.
I will go to lab and bring medicines.

810
01:17:00,933 --> 01:17:02,517
Wait… I too am coming….

811
01:17:04,558 --> 01:17:05,308
Priya...

812
01:17:22,267 --> 01:17:24,725
Priya….
-I can’t bear, Viakuntam….

813
01:17:24,725 --> 01:17:28,225
Priya… Priya…. don’t scream.

814
01:17:28,642 --> 01:17:31,308
Priya… Priya…

815
01:17:31,808 --> 01:17:34,600
Priya... Priya…

816
01:17:37,308 --> 01:17:38,017
Priya...

817
01:18:05,433 --> 01:18:06,892
What’s up?
what happened to all these zombies?

818
01:18:08,892 --> 01:18:11,475
Where did they go? Unable to understand.

819
01:18:12,308 --> 01:18:14,017
How to catch that watchman now?

820
01:18:14,767 --> 01:18:17,767
Aah…I know where the watchman will be.
Shall we go?

821
01:18:19,350 --> 01:18:20,350
Let’s move.

822
01:18:44,850 --> 01:18:47,100
Oh! Why didn’t I receive,
even a single phone call till now.

823
01:18:50,475 --> 01:18:51,933
Come on… lift… lift.

824
01:19:07,767 --> 01:19:08,767
Crap…

825
01:19:12,642 --> 01:19:14,808
Sara!! what is happening there?

826
01:19:30,808 --> 01:19:32,517
Sir…Sir
-What?

827
01:19:32,517 --> 01:19:35,350
We will jump the gate and escape from here, sir.
-Have you lost your mind?

828
01:19:35,642 --> 01:19:37,267
Don’t you know the siren will go off,
the moment we climb the gate?

829
01:19:37,267 --> 01:19:40,058
Sir, I cannot bear all this.
We will jump the gate and go from here, sir.

830
01:19:40,058 --> 01:19:41,975
No….
-Come on sir, please sir….

831
01:19:41,975 --> 01:19:44,100
Listen to me…hey Jeshu…
-Sir, please sir…

832
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:47,642
Jeshu, listen…It will be a problem…
-No sir, leave me, I am going sir.

833
01:19:47,642 --> 01:19:48,558
If we stay we will die here.

834
01:19:48,558 --> 01:19:50,183
I am going sir.
- Listen to me… No…

835
01:20:18,683 --> 01:20:20,267
Sir… sir….

836
01:20:21,017 --> 01:20:22,142
Hey, what happened?

837
01:20:22,142 --> 01:20:22,767
Save me Sir.

838
01:20:27,767 --> 01:20:28,350
Sir...

839
01:20:44,225 --> 01:20:44,892
Sir...

840
01:20:45,558 --> 01:20:46,225
Sir...

841
01:20:48,808 --> 01:20:51,183
Sir… Sir… Sir… Quick….
-My leg is coming out, sir….

842
01:20:58,100 --> 01:20:59,683
Sir... save me.

843
01:21:02,183 --> 01:21:05,392
Quick…
-Slowly, sir….

844
01:21:06,350 --> 01:21:10,183
Get up, come on….

845
01:21:12,558 --> 01:21:16,808
Sir sorry sir… sir sorry sir…sorry,
sir….

846
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:17,808
Hey!!!

847
01:21:17,808 --> 01:21:18,517
You didn’t listen to me, see now?

848
01:21:18,517 --> 01:21:19,267
Sorry sir…

849
01:21:20,892 --> 01:21:24,725
What is this, bro?
Seems no one is willing to let me live…

850
01:21:24,725 --> 01:21:25,850
Will you kill me?

851
01:21:26,267 --> 01:21:27,183
Ok.

852
01:21:28,308 --> 01:21:32,642
Both of you go to locker room
and try to call Aditya Sir.

853
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:34,850
Hey… let’s move

854
01:21:35,350 --> 01:21:36,725
Come on…

855
01:22:16,058 --> 01:22:17,517
Sir, are you able to reach him?

856
01:22:22,975 --> 01:22:24,475
What happened,
sir… Is the call got connected?

857
01:22:47,808 --> 01:22:48,725
Oh no!

858
01:22:48,725 --> 01:22:49,933
Hey…

859
01:22:57,267 --> 01:22:58,600
Slow... Slow.

860
01:24:48,267 --> 01:24:49,308
Where is he?

861
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,350
How to know, where he has kept the keys?

862
01:25:05,850 --> 01:25:08,892
Go and ask him!! He will say, “here,
take the keys and place them in your hand”.

863
01:25:14,558 --> 01:25:15,683
Oh!!! There the Keys!!!

864
01:25:17,058 --> 01:25:17,975
Do one thing.

865
01:25:18,350 --> 01:25:21,308
You go and hold him… I will
come next and grab the keys.

866
01:25:21,308 --> 01:25:24,017
Duh…You want that creature to
macerate and kill me, as I hold it...

867
01:25:24,017 --> 01:25:25,683
while you escape and survive…
-Ok. Come on

868
01:25:25,683 --> 01:25:27,517
If you want, you hold him….
I’ll snatch the keys…

869
01:25:28,142 --> 01:25:29,850
Looks today is our last day.

870
01:25:36,808 --> 01:25:37,975
Let's go.

871
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:13,017
Check there.

872
01:26:32,767 --> 01:26:34,975
Arka, you look in this. I will search here.

873
01:26:35,308 --> 01:26:36,433
Ok. Search quickly.

874
01:26:42,558 --> 01:26:45,225
Sara, here it is. We found it.

875
01:26:46,433 --> 01:26:47,058
Come on.

876
01:27:14,642 --> 01:27:18,183
You missed a golden chance, you nincompoop.

877
01:27:25,933 --> 01:27:29,183
This is the only good thing you have
ever done in your life. Let’s move…

878
01:27:29,433 --> 01:27:31,767
Agneya, Sun of fire!!!

879
01:27:31,767 --> 01:27:33,642
-Uh-huh…Let's go.

880
01:28:38,892 --> 01:28:41,142
He is coming this side only.

881
01:29:05,433 --> 01:29:08,850
What to do? There is no incoming
and no out going from the morning.

882
01:29:09,142 --> 01:29:10,475
How can we control everything?

883
01:29:10,725 --> 01:29:11,892
Let’s move.

884
01:29:24,767 --> 01:29:25,475
Acharya…

885
01:29:27,642 --> 01:29:29,017
Why are you here?

886
01:29:29,683 --> 01:29:30,808
Zombies will come.

887
01:29:31,642 --> 01:29:32,392
You...

888
01:29:33,142 --> 01:29:34,267
Acharya…

889
01:29:46,725 --> 01:29:49,058
You go upstairs.
-Where are you going, bro?

890
01:29:49,058 --> 01:29:49,933
Go...

891
01:30:21,517 --> 01:30:22,100
Madam...

892
01:30:24,517 --> 01:30:25,100
Madam...

893
01:30:27,058 --> 01:30:27,642
Madam...

894
01:31:10,725 --> 01:31:11,308
Priya…

895
01:31:13,017 --> 01:31:13,558
Priya…

896
01:31:19,892 --> 01:31:21,933
Oh my God!! Has she too become a zombie?

897
01:31:24,058 --> 01:31:25,267
She seems to be fine…

898
01:31:30,975 --> 01:31:32,975
Oh my God. She is alive.

899
01:31:35,058 --> 01:31:35,558
Priya…

900
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:37,100
Priya…

901
01:31:38,267 --> 01:31:38,767
Priya…

902
01:31:41,308 --> 01:31:43,183
why did they leave her alone?

903
01:31:45,558 --> 01:31:46,142
Priya...

904
01:31:46,642 --> 01:31:47,225
Priya...

905
01:31:47,933 --> 01:31:49,683
where have they all gone?

906
01:31:59,475 --> 01:32:00,058
Priya...

907
01:32:03,183 --> 01:32:05,017
I am unable to understand anything.

908
01:35:23,017 --> 01:35:24,183
Sara...

909
01:35:34,517 --> 01:35:35,725
Sara...

910
01:35:37,725 --> 01:35:38,808
Sara...

911
01:35:43,350 --> 01:35:44,350
Sara...

912
01:35:44,975 --> 01:35:45,892
Sara...

913
01:35:46,683 --> 01:35:47,725
What happened, Sara?

914
01:38:08,517 --> 01:38:09,517
Hello…
-Hello…

915
01:38:09,517 --> 01:38:10,267
It’s me.

916
01:38:11,058 --> 01:38:11,767
Yaa…Tell me

917
01:38:12,975 --> 01:38:14,392
You know my student Sara, right?

918
01:38:14,683 --> 01:38:16,142
She wanted to do an experiment…

919
01:38:16,433 --> 01:38:18,142
for testing the efficacy of that drug, I have
sent a convicted criminal along with her.

920
01:38:18,142 --> 01:38:20,225
What?! How can you send like that?

921
01:38:20,225 --> 01:38:22,392
What to do? She is a brilliant student.

922
01:38:22,558 --> 01:38:24,975
If it is successful,
it will be a huge breakthrough.

923
01:38:24,975 --> 01:38:25,808
That’s why sent him.

924
01:38:25,808 --> 01:38:28,767
No… it’s not correct.
-No… I don’t mean that…

925
01:38:28,850 --> 01:38:31,850
How did you think they can handle a criminal?
-I have sent Rudra also.

926
01:38:31,850 --> 01:38:34,975
So what? what can Rudra alone do?

927
01:38:35,683 --> 01:38:36,933
Ok… what is the problem, now?

928
01:38:36,933 --> 01:38:41,767
As of now nothing… but, I didn’t receive even
a single phone call from them from yesterday.

929
01:38:42,058 --> 01:38:43,183
I see.

930
01:38:43,767 --> 01:38:46,308
Moreover,
the land line over there is also not working.

931
01:38:47,558 --> 01:38:48,975
I am tense and jittery.

932
01:38:49,225 --> 01:38:50,558
You have committed a blunder.

933
01:38:50,683 --> 01:38:54,100
You should have informed me,
before taking such a big decision.

934
01:38:54,558 --> 01:38:55,267
Sorry.

935
01:38:55,850 --> 01:38:57,433
Please help me out this time.

936
01:38:57,767 --> 01:39:00,975
Ok…ok... I will send my team.
You don’t worry.

937
01:39:00,975 --> 01:39:02,017
Ok. Bye.

938
01:39:48,975 --> 01:39:52,100

Please save Priya sir.

947
01:40:12,433 --> 01:40:16,392
Priya doesn’t have any
connection with this, sir.

948
01:40:17,058 --> 01:40:17,725
Viakuntam…

949
01:40:19,808 --> 01:40:21,683
Sir, please save Priya.

950
01:40:21,892 --> 01:40:23,767

01:40:28,225 --> 01:40:28,933
Please save her.

955
01:40:29,975 --> 01:40:31,308
She is a very innocent girl Sir.

956
01:40:31,308 --> 01:40:32,433
Viakuntam… please Sir.

957
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:33,558

Viakuntam…

962
01:41:01,517 --> 01:41:02,558
She is my wife.

963
01:41:03,725 --> 01:41:05,142
She doesn’t have anyone except me.

964
01:46:02,017 --> 01:46:03,350
Do you have severe pain?

965
01:46:23,100 --> 01:46:25,100
What should I tell to Aditya Sir, now?

966
01:46:27,017 --> 01:46:28,683
Inform that we are alive.
