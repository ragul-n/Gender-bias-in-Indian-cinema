1
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:25,958
It is said that a girl is born 
on earth when a star smiles.

2
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:31,708
And one day, one of the million stars out 
there felt like smiling for some reason.

3
00:01:55,458 --> 00:02:00,416
She started understanding the world 
around her through her uncle.

4
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:02,708
In their journeys together.

5
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,916
Through their happiness.

6
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:08,375
Through their smiles.

7
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:34,666
Uncle!

8
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:36,666
You also want to go dear?

9
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:50,583
Oh no!

10
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:52,083
- Uncle! - Dear!

11
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,916
Hope the travel was comfortable.

12
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:08,625
She realized then, sometimes it can 
hurt even without getting a cut.

13
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:14,500
Girls should be brought 
up with some discipline.

14
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,333
But how, if the mother 
herself isn't right..

15
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:19,208
The day that Laya didn't 
return from college..

16
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,708
She still remembers 
it with fear.

17
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:26,375
That's when the world 
around her began to change.

18
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:28,458
Come.

19
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,458
Come.

20
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:36,166
Come here.

21
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,291
Come here.

22
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,416
Walk!

23
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,833
- Today's Maths exam was tough. 
- It was okay.

24
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:44,666
Maths?

25
00:03:44,666 --> 00:03:45,750
How was it for you?

26
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:48,666
I have no idea what I'll 
do for tomorrows exam.

27
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,875
One by one, boundaries started 
building up in front of her.

28
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:56,958
She started losing 
her perspectives.

29
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:11,166
I have always felt that 
every person is different.

30
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:13,750
I have always felt that 
every person is different.

31
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,583
Sometimes undeserving luck 
comes searching for them.

32
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:18,958
Some work hard to 
get what they want.

33
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:23,583
Then there are others who do nothing but 
still manage to live a comfortable life.

34
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:25,333
S.K.

35
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:28,750
This is about how 
his day starts off.

36
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,375
I have told you many times...

37
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,875
Don't come in front of 
me with two shirts on.

38
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:35,083
Are you trying to make 
me work twice as hard?

39
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:35,833
Mom!

40
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:36,458
Kumma!

41
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:42,666
He has never got into work before 
taking the attendance of all the girls

42
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:48,208
S.K. is an accountant at Ouseph's 
wholesale shop at Ariyangadi, Thrissur.

43
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,416
The load is here, 
go check it out.

44
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:54,166
S. K. also used to turn over commission 
from the union members who came to work.

45
00:04:54,333 --> 00:05:00,000
S. K. also used to turn over commission 
from the union members who came to work.

46
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:02,708
Compromise talks between gangs.

47
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,083
Where are you from?

48
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:18,708
Angamaly

49
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:18,916
S. K. would play them using the name 
of some big gangster from their area.

50
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:23,083
S. K. would play them using the name 
of some big gangster from their area.

51
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:24,916
Our Tony's area.

52
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,166
Which Tony in Angamaly?

53
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,833
There is only one 
Angamaly Tony for me.

54
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,416
'Vadivaalu Tony,' the one who murdered a 
S.I. after tying him down a railway track.

55
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:40,458
And like that, they 
all fall for it

56
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,791
And like that, they 
all fall for it

57
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:45,000
Tell that I said 'Hi' 
if you see Tony.

58
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,708
So it's a compromise right?

59
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,291
Now, where are you from?

60
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:51,333
Mattanchery.

61
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:56,333
Something happened yesterday.

62
00:05:56,916 --> 00:06:00,041
Someone was troubling our Manaf's 
sister on her way to tuition.

63
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:01,250
Some guy who knows karate.

64
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,500
Guess who it was?

65
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,958
Our Sijo, the one from Athani.

66
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,750
Which Sijo?

67
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,000
He was a bit bald.

68
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,541
Yes. Him.

69
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:11,375
I went straight to his karate class. 
There were around 50-60 people there.

70
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:14,708
I straight away went for the 
nose and started bashing it in.

71
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,208
Soda?

72
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,583
I gave them a nice beating.

73
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:18,958
He's showing off his 
karate skills on girls?

74
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,416
I won't allow this

75
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:23,583
This karate and all 
won't work for us.

76
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:27,833
What?

77
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,458
What are you sad about?

78
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,416
That Sunitha from 
tailoring, right.

79
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:31,791
She has poked me on Facebook.

80
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,875
She has poked me on Facebook.

81
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:36,416
And I don't know 
how to poke back.

82
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:37,875
S.K. set it up for him.

83
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:38,833
Okay.

84
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:39,750
We'll see.

85
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:40,916
I'll set it up.

86
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,250
No issue.

87
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:02,666
Last years Thrissur Pooram,

88
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:04,791
I was going around 
searching for him.

89
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:06,750
There were a lot of people.

90
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:10,250
There were a lot of gangsters, 
police and many others.

91
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,166
And I find him sitting 
on top of an elephant.

92
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:15,375
I went straight up to him and 
pulled him down the elephant.

93
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:19,500
I pushed him towards a wall, spat on 
my knuckles and started punching him.

94
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,666
- His game was over after that. 
- S.K.

95
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:24,916
Why do you spit on your 
knuckles before you punch?

96
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:28,500
It's just a style. 
An ordinary style.

97
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:31,833
Is it okay to just rub 
some spit on this finger?

98
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:34,500
- Rub? - Yeah.

99
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,291
Is this some Amrutanjan 
to rub over?

100
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:37,916
If you don't get it, 
go back to your class.

101
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,541
Go study something.

102
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:40,666
Rub..

103
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:44,875
Apsara S.

104
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:49,000
She was the dream 
girl of that college.

105
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:52,958
There were many behind her 
but ahead of all of them..

106
00:07:57,375 --> 00:08:00,291
Back then there was a question 
S.K.'s friends kept asking him.

107
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,833
S.K. can't you just tell her?

108
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:08,125
This Anju, Manju, Kunju, Renju, Sanju.. 
Why do you think they come to college?

109
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:09,208
To see me.

110
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,458
They are coming just to see me.

111
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,500
I'm their only hope.

112
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:16,416
How will they bear it when they 
come to know that I'm engaged.

113
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:17,375
That's right.

114
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:20,000
I should be a bachelor 
till the college ends.

115
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,875
- But I'll say. - When?

116
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,083
Last day.

117
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:28,375
Come. S.K. is going to propose.

118
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:33,666
[Apsara singing in 
the background]

119
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:46,666
"Tei"

120
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:47,750
Tei?

121
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:48,791
Tei.

122
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:51,833
Teiiiii...!?

123
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:52,458
Tei.

124
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,041
Tei.

125
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,708
- Tei? 
- Yeah, sing something with Tei.

126
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:59,708
It's seems like Allu Arjun's 
situation in Arya 2.

127
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,958
Ugghh! Who is this guy 
spoiling the mood?

128
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,416
Who is this guy>

129
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:33,833
- Where is he off to? - Bro.

130
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:35,416
What are you doing here?

131
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,666
- S.K. - It's been a long time.

132
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,416
What is it? Any problem?

133
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:42,416
Were you thinking about Apsara?

134
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,250
Apsara?

135
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,208
Which Apsara?

136
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,583
From Botony class.

137
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,000
In college?

138
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,041
Apsara S.

139
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,166
I haven't seen her 
after college.

140
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:57,916
S.K. !

141
00:09:58,583 --> 00:09:58,625
S.K. !

142
00:09:58,625 --> 00:09:59,583
S.K. !

143
00:09:59,750 --> 00:09:59,791
It's been a while 
since you went in.

144
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,583
It's been a while 
since you went in.

145
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:01,625
We are struggling here for water and 
you are playing around in there.

146
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:05,625
We are struggling here for water and 
you are playing around in there.

147
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:07,416
Cheater.

148
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:14,250
I liked you back then itself.

149
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:17,541
For some reason we never 
talked about her.

150
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,166
Step back! Leave me!

151
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,666
I'll stab that fraud Vinu.

152
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,166
Leave me!

153
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:36,208
You feel relieved?

154
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:38,708
Should I say two more?

155
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,083
David! 2 chilled beers!

156
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:47,791
S.K. I don't have anyone.

157
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,458
No one udnerstands me S.K.

158
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:50,500
Brother!

159
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,583
Can I drink this too?

160
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:52,583
Hey! Give me back my class.

161
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:53,708
Give the glass back.

162
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,875
- S.K. I'm lonely. - I'm sorry.

163
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:01,416
S.K. You know how relieved 
I was when I saw you.

164
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,166
S.K. can solve everything.

165
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,166
S.K. is the only one 
who can understand me.

166
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:06,500
S.K.! Save me S.K.!

167
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:16,500
A true friend is not someone who 
leaves you behind during a bad time.

168
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,708
He is someone who sticks with 
you in your hardest moments

169
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,625
Tell me. What's your problem?

170
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:24,125
S.K. it's not right of 
me to tell you this.

171
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:27,666
Nothing good has come to 
you from me till now.

172
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:29,708
Only sorrow.

173
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:30,791
That's not important.

174
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:32,458
That's not important.

175
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:35,208
It's not about when a relationship 
starts between 2 people.

176
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,166
It's about when the relation 
started becoming meaningful.

177
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,625
I'm here. Tell me.

178
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,083
Allu Arjun is taking 
over his head.

179
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,291
I don't know why she said that?

180
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,333
What did she say? That 
she didn't like you?

181
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:48,958
Or did she invite you 
to her marriage?

182
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,041
Or does she have 
cancer or something?

183
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:52,125
Whatever it is. Tell me!

184
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,291
Just shut up for a moment.

185
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:53,375
Give him a gap to speak.

186
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,875
Give him a gap to speak.

187
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:55,125
Say.

188
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:55,708
Say.

189
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:56,500
S.K.

190
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:57,291
Tell me.

191
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,833
She will eloping by 
tomorrow morning 11am.

192
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:00,708
Elope?

193
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,166
So?

194
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:02,541
I don't know.

195
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:03,208
I don't know.

196
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:03,625
Where will I take her?

197
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:04,875
Where will I take her?

198
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,583
I haven't even said 
this to my parents yet.

199
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:11,541
My hands and legs are trembling 
just thinking about it.

200
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,625
She's asking me something 
for the first time..

201
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:17,583
Whether I come or not she 
will leave her house at 11.

202
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:22,166
What I fear is whether she 
would do something to herself?

203
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:22,833
This is trouble.

204
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,166
This is trouble.

205
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:24,833
All my friends bailed on me.

206
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:27,125
All my friends bailed on me.

207
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:31,250
Someone told me that I can 
get some peace if I drink.

208
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,125
That the sadness will go away.

209
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,333
Can you get me some 
liqour to drink?

210
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:37,916
It's 11:30pm, or we 
could have arranged it.

211
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,208
Don't worry about that..

212
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,291
You have money? If you 
do we can arrange it.

213
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,041
Let's try.

214
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,000
Let's try.

215
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:43,375
Drunks!

216
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:44,125
Drunks!

217
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:45,916
Put this aside.

218
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,041
What a fool you are.

219
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,708
If drinking solves everything, 
everyone should be doing that.

220
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,666
The next generation will 
be learning from us.

221
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,291
Don't drink and blabber.

222
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:53,333
Get lost.

223
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:54,208
Get lost.

224
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:56,083
We need to drink. Curse you.

225
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:57,583
Bro, it's not for us.

226
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,375
What if he drinks 
and feels better.

227
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:01,333
Yeah right! Just shut up.

228
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:02,041
Vinu.

229
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,125
- We are with you. 
- Us?

230
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:03,541
For sure.

231
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:04,416
Not me.

232
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,208
The troubles that 
come finding us

233
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:07,250
We don't need you.

234
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,375
Who called you anyway ?

235
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:09,916
No need, I'll take 
care of it myself.

236
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:12,375
I'm with you. Tell me, 
where does she live?

237
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,250
She is actually 
from Kothamangalam.

238
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:15,583
Okay.

239
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,958
She goes to work from 
her aunts house.

240
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:19,750
Thrissur? Where in Thrissur?

241
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,750
Thrissur...

242
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:23,208
Some colony.

243
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:27,916
Colony!

244
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,708
Yes!

245
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,791
We will be sketching every colony 
in Thrissur tonight itself.

246
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:35,125
Can't even hold a sketch pen properly at this 
time and he wants to sketch every colony.

247
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,083
Get lost.

248
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:36,208
You tell. Which colony.

249
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:37,708
You tell. Which colony.

250
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:40,208
Ambedhkar colony.

251
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:41,291
Ambedhkar colony.

252
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,625
Ambedhkar colony?

253
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:45,833
Which house there?

254
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:50,083
It's like a white house that looks 
like a scrambled match box.

255
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:54,083
Too many stripes, stair 
ways outside and all.

256
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:54,500
Is it this house?

257
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,583
Is it this house?

258
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:56,625
Yes.

259
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:58,833
This house exactly.

260
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:03,083
But all the girls in this 
house are studying abroad.

261
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:05,500
No, this is her aunty's house.

262
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,416
She is going to work from here.

263
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,333
She loves this biscuit?

264
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:10,333
Naah.

265
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:11,916
What did you say her name was?

266
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:12,958
Move, move..

267
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:16,666
Angelina.

268
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:17,791
Angeleena.

269
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:18,833
Angelina Jolie

270
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:19,916
Nice name right?

271
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:20,791
Joly?

272
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:22,791
Not Angelina, Angeline

273
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:23,708
Not Na, in.

274
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:25,416
I will bear that.

275
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:26,375
I'll tell you one thing.

276
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:27,500
I'm going to marry her.

277
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,208
Don't waste time 
going behind her.

278
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,791
The second you get there. 
Get lost.

279
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:31,833
I will follow her, flirt with 
her and maybe even marry her.

280
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:34,250
I will follow her, flirt with 
her and maybe even marry her.

281
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,083
Do idiots like you even have 
the right to follow her?

282
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,958
I play the game not sit and 
applaud at the gallery like you.

283
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,750
I will keep pursuing her. Have you 
ever had a girlfriend in your life?

284
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:43,791
Have you?

285
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:44,416
Have you?

286
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:45,000
You get lost!

287
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,458
Have you?

288
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,083
Get lost.

289
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,291
This is definitely 
targeted towards me.

290
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,583
This is something this brat 
has been doing for years

291
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,166
First Apsara, now her.

292
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:13,625
No, I don't think so.

293
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:14,791
No, I don't think so.

294
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,958
I don't think any of 
this is going to happen.

295
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:21,041
She hasn't even looked at me once in 
all this time I've been behind her.

296
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:24,000
So there's no way she fell for this guy 
whose not even half as good looking as me.

297
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,583
Either she is tricking him..

298
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:26,875
Or she is crazy.

299
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:27,083
Sure.

300
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:27,708
Sure.

301
00:18:28,166 --> 00:18:28,833
No.

302
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:30,375
There might be a chance. 
This is actually true.

303
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:33,875
- He, knows that.. 
- That?

304
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:35,666
- What is that? 
- Song.

305
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:38,041
His voice is like 
some waxed eggplant.

306
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,458
That's enough for girls.

307
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,625
No, I don't think so.

308
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:42,958
Whatever it is, decide fast.

309
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:45,375
He hasn't stopped crying yet.

310
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,333
If you can't do it, 
then just leave it.

311
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:50,500
Even took away the chance 
of some free liquor.

312
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,750
Ittup come here, I 
have something to say.

313
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:54,083
- Come. 
- What is it?

314
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,750
- Just come. 
- Is there some other liquor there?

315
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:57,375
Ittupetta..

316
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:57,458
Do you actually believe that our 
Angeline will elope with this guy.

317
00:18:57,583 --> 00:19:01,500
Do you actually believe that our 
Angeline will elope with this guy.

318
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:01,625
Do you, no right.

319
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:02,500
Do you, no right.

320
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:03,125
That I don't.

321
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:03,208
So dear brother, take him and 
deal with the bottle first.

322
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:06,375
So dear brother, take him and 
deal with the bottle first.

323
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:07,416
Let that happen at least.

324
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:10,541
That S.K. is there, he might 
scold me in front of his friend.

325
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:10,625
Yeah right S.K.

326
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,208
Yeah right S.K.

327
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:11,250
He can't even move a cat 
from this room to the other.

328
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:15,208
He can't even move a cat 
from this room to the other.

329
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,500
And he is going to 
help them marry?

330
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,833
Do you believe all this?

331
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:18,333
S.K.

332
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:18,791
S.K.

333
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:19,958
S.K.

334
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,833
Who, the one who talks 
like that Telugu actor?

335
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:25,833
Will anyone actually go to that S.K. 
for compromise?

336
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,916
What a tragedy that guy is.

337
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:30,083
Ugghh!

338
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,416
Go back to your home.

339
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:34,625
Tei..

340
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:35,583
Tei..

341
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:56,791
Okay.

342
00:19:57,916 --> 00:19:59,291
This is her..

343
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:00,833
This is us..

344
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:02,208
This is her parents

345
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,083
This is her parents

346
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:05,833
Wait, not with this. 
Do one thing for now.

347
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,333
Adjust with this jug for now.

348
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:08,583
You ruined the flow.

349
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:11,083
- I'm hungry. 
- You say.

350
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:12,458
Listen.

351
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,875
We go straight to her house.

352
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:18,083
With her we go to the 
register office.

353
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,541
Marriage. Very simple.

354
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:21,458
We will definitely rock this.

355
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:24,708
But for this plan to work.

356
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,916
We need 3 things importantly.

357
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:26,958
That I know.

358
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
That I know.

359
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:28,125
The first thing is..

360
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:29,500
The first thing is..

361
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:29,625
The pepper bottle.

362
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:30,541
The pepper bottle.

363
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:31,583
Second the steel glass.

364
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,208
- Then a jug.. 
- Exactly.

365
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:36,208
Do you have any common sense. We 
need to know about her parents.

366
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:37,166
Just ask him.

367
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:37,541
Say.

368
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:39,875
She is an only daughter.

369
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:40,500
Okay.

370
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,958
Her dad, She has a father.

371
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,458
- Achan- Daddy? 
- Mummy and then.

372
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:45,333
Then they have a lot of fields.

373
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:47,458
She must be experienced 
in jumping off walls.

374
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,125
I mean you know a 
lot about fields.

375
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:49,166
We are following each 
other on Instagram..

376
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:49,500
We are following each 
other on Instagram..

377
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,791
We are following each 
other on Instagram..

378
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:55,375
You are not here for some real estate 
deal, you are here to marry right?

379
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,958
This won't work out.

380
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,583
Do you know anyone 
in Kothamangalam.

381
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,041
There is someone.

382
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:02,166
He might know.

383
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:02,208
Some goon or smuggler. Who else will 
he know or maybe he's just bluffing.

384
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:05,791
Some goon or smuggler. Who else will 
he know or maybe he's just bluffing.

385
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:08,791
This is not the time for you to 
make jokes, It's a mans life here.

386
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:08,916
Whatever. Say who it is.

387
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,750
Whatever. Say who it is.

388
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:15,375
There is someone, but he might 
turn out to be a headache.

389
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:17,166
Are you talking about 
that Lovelesh?

390
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,250
I knew where this car 
was driving off to.

391
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,291
Call him, do it right now.

392
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:24,500
It's not that big a deal. 
Give me that mobile.

393
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:26,125
- No problem at all. 
- Actually how is it?

394
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,708
He's a complete loser. 
You know him right

395
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,125
I was talking about the beef.

396
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:30,208
Beef is really good.

397
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:31,875
Lower.

398
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:37,583
Hello!

399
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:39,333
Hey Lovelu, it's me S.K. 
Are you busy.

400
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:40,375
Busy and me, say 
what the matter is.

401
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:42,083
Busy and me, say 
what the matter is.

402
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:42,625
- How is Angamaly Tony? 
- He is fine.

403
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,708
- How is Angamaly Tony? 
- He is fine.

404
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:48,333
Actually, I called you 
for some information.

405
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:48,500
What?

406
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:48,833
What?

407
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,208
Do you know an Angeline 
who lives near you?

408
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,500
Great, Angeline from Kothamangalam. There 
might be around 10 girls here in that name.

409
00:21:56,916 --> 00:22:00,208
She works at Thrissur, 
beautiful..

410
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:01,458
Great eyes.

411
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:01,541
Nice smile.

412
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:02,250
Nice smile.

413
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:04,583
You are not the 
one marrying her.

414
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:05,291
It's him.

415
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,333
He's making poems in between.

416
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:09,666
Are you the one marrying 
that Angeline now?

417
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:13,833
No, I just called to 
enquire about her parents.

418
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:17,041
Tell you the truth. Her 
family is a bad batch.

419
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:21,125
Hello!

420
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,500
The call was cut.

421
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,541
Try him once again.

422
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,500
It's saying out 
of coverage area.

423
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:29,125
Is it?

424
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:30,000
That's a pity.

425
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:33,875
See, what he said was that the 
parents are a little trouble.

426
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:36,416
- Is it. 
- It's same with every parents with a girl.

427
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:38,375
Anyway we can't move anywhere 
but forward with this, right?

428
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:39,916
Exactly, that's what I told.

429
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,500
- But things won't be that easy. 
- Why is that?

430
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:42,958
It never will.

431
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:46,125
We need 3 things for 
that importantly.

432
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:46,833
What?

433
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:50,208
2 bouquets, 2 necklaces 
and 50 ladoos.

434
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:52,125
50 ladoos, for what?

435
00:22:52,791 --> 00:22:55,833
Where is this guy from, there should 
be something sweet for such occasions.

436
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:55,916
- Is it? 
- Then what.

437
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,041

- Then what.

438
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:58,250
Paysam for Hindus.

439
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:00,541
Ice cream for Christians.

440
00:23:00,583 --> 00:23:02,041
- For Muslims... 
- Pineapple.

441
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:03,041
Pineapple.

442
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:04,833
A register marriage without laddo..

443
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:06,541
- Can't even imagine it. 
- Then don't.

444
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:07,583
50 ladoos right?

445
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:08,791
I'll take care of that

446
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:10,541
- Okay. 
- The ladoo is set.

447
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:11,666
Then what's the problem?

448
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:12,833
Yeah nothing.

449
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:14,083
No problem, everything is okay.

450
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:15,208
Not that..

451
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:17,583
Are we going in this 
to Kothamangalam?

452
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:20,666
Us local audience 
just asked a doubt

453
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:21,958
We can take the bus 
till Kothamanagalam.

454
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,916
Then from them bus stop we 
can take an auto, right?

455
00:23:25,291 --> 00:23:26,083
Bus?

456
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:29,000
Superb. Then there won't 
issues with traveling light.

457
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:32,166
Then it would be nice to elope 
in an auto rickshaw right?

458
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:32,916
Any problem?

459
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:35,083
Are you serious?

460
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:38,041
Most importantly we need a car.

461
00:23:39,291 --> 00:23:40,291
Car..

462
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:43,083
Car... From where 
will we arrange that.

463
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:45,958
- He can easily arrange it. 
- Is it.

464
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:47,166
Then what.

465
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:50,166
He keeps saying he will 
arrange cars for trips right?

466
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:51,666
Can you actually arrange it?

467
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:53,500
Will we get a car?

468
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,250
Whatever.

469
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:54,291
So since he said he'll arrange the car. 
It's all set right?

470
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:57,000
So since he said he'll arrange the car. 
It's all set right?

471
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,500
No.

472
00:23:57,625 --> 00:23:58,625
We will set his marriage.

473
00:23:58,625 --> 00:23:59,291
Rahul Etta!

474
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:00,416
You have a big heart.

475
00:24:00,416 --> 00:24:01,750
You have a big heart.

476
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:03,208
I'll never forget this favor.

477
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:05,541
Since the car is arranged. 
Take this porotta in too.

478
00:24:06,666 --> 00:24:09,291
Have you taken some pledge to 
bring these problems to me?

479
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:12,166
But still she, how long 
did we follow her.

480
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:13,208
Her..

481
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:13,333
You still believe all this?

482
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,458
You still believe all this?

483
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,291
She won't be coming tomorrow.

484
00:24:16,875 --> 00:24:16,916
That's not what I'm afraid of.

485
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:17,875
That's not what I'm afraid of.

486
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:19,958
He seems innocent..

487
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:20,375
When he realizes 
that she cheated..

488
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,458
When he realizes 
that she cheated..

489
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:24,416
He suicides or something, we will 
have to face the consequences.

490
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:27,333
I decided to come, 
just in case...

491
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,625
To see her house and all.

492
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:30,458
Do one thing..

493
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:31,416
Do one thing..

494
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:34,333
Advice him when 
you get the time.

495
00:24:34,458 --> 00:24:37,375
Let your rotten psychology 
be of some help.

496
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:37,916
I'm going, see you tomorrow.

497
00:24:37,916 --> 00:24:38,875

00:24:40,708 --> 00:24:41,958

- See you tomorrow - Okay.

- He's superb.

504
00:24:55,625 --> 00:24:57,708
You can sleep inside. 
Rahuls bed is free.

505
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:00,375
I'll sleep here.

506
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,833
We don't have much time, we 
have to early tomorrow right?

507
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:05,833
Then I'll also sleep here.

Take.

509
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:20,250
How did you guys 
meet each other?

510
00:25:20,708 --> 00:25:22,083
- Angeline? 
- Yeah.

511
00:25:23,291 --> 00:25:24,875
That's a long story.

512
00:25:25,416 --> 00:25:27,625
Night are for stories. You tell.

513
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:33,333
We saw each other 
at a parking lot.

514
00:25:51,958 --> 00:25:56,458
I filled the petrol. She started the 
scooter. It started and she left.

515
00:25:57,333 --> 00:25:58,083
Then?

516
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:03,666
Then, we met again.Talked. 
Got close.

517
00:26:03,666 --> 00:26:05,791
With this bottle half 
filled with petrol?

518
00:26:05,791 --> 00:26:07,041
Yes. Why?

519
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:11,583
How long have you 
guys been in love?

520
00:26:12,666 --> 00:26:13,291
We

00:26:14,583 --> 00:26:16,083

522
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:17,666
Around 23 days.

523
00:26:18,416 --> 00:26:19,416
23 days?

524
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,750
Is there a problem with 23 days?

525
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,875
No, no problem at all.

526
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:26,333
Give that.

527
00:26:26,708 --> 00:26:26,750
You sleep, have to 
wake up early right?

528
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,458
You sleep, have to 
wake up early right?

529
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:30,583
You have a spare pillow?

530
00:26:30,583 --> 00:26:31,583

532
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:39,208
I'll show you.

533
00:26:49,458 --> 00:26:50,958
Mamanaciaotto

534
00:26:55,708 --> 00:26:57,250
See if you can understand this.

535
00:27:00,625 --> 00:27:01,833
See if you can understand this?

536
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:03,250
- What is it? 
- That Lovelesh send it.

537
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:04,333
Mammancy Auto

538
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:05,708
Mammancy Auto?

539
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,791
Maybe he's wishing all the best 
or goodbye in his language.

540
00:27:08,791 --> 00:27:09,791
You sleep.

541
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:12,125
I have to buy the necklace 
and bouquets in the morning.

542
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:14,625
- Mamanaciaotto? 
- Even the groom has slept.

543
00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:32,333
Kids, the car is ready.

544
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,500
Bloody puppies.

545
00:27:35,125 --> 00:27:36,750
S.K. wake up!

546
00:27:37,166 --> 00:27:37,666
S.K.!

547
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:39,250
S.K. wake up!

548
00:27:39,333 --> 00:27:40,291
Look at the time.

549
00:27:40,958 --> 00:27:41,000
Stop playing around.

550
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,166
Stop playing around.

551
00:27:42,791 --> 00:27:43,708
Sir, bro...

552
00:27:43,916 --> 00:27:43,958
Don't you want to marry?

553
00:27:43,958 --> 00:27:45,416
Don't you want to marry?

554
00:27:45,416 --> 00:27:47,291
Wake up. It's 8:45am

555
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:48,458
Hey Ittup. Now where is this guy

556
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:50,916
Hey Ittup. Now where is this guy

557
00:27:51,916 --> 00:27:56,041
Best,you were supposed to buy the necklaces 
and bouquets and you are here sleeping.

558
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:56,083
I had to take the car 
from around 50km away.

559
00:27:56,083 --> 00:27:58,416
I had to take the car 
from around 50km away.

560
00:27:59,291 --> 00:28:01,916
Everyone here is just good 
to make fancy dialogues.

561
00:28:01,958 --> 00:28:02,958
Wake up man!

562
00:28:03,291 --> 00:28:04,958
Let the sun shine first.

563
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,541
The shop has to open right?

564
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,333
We are going by car either way

565
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:09,708
We can stop somewhere and buy.

566
00:28:09,708 --> 00:28:11,000
Let me lie down a while.

567
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,125
Wake up, made me get 
up in the morning..

568
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:15,125
And you are sleeping here.

569
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,750
Arrange a wreath 
with that bouquet.

570
00:28:19,666 --> 00:28:20,666
Walk.

571
00:28:20,708 --> 00:28:21,708
Don't push.

572
00:28:22,958 --> 00:28:23,958
Make it fast.

573
00:28:24,708 --> 00:28:24,750
You have paste to brush?

574
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,208
You have paste to brush?

575
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,000
Stop making me laugh.

576
00:28:28,125 --> 00:28:29,708
We don't have such bad habits.

577
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,958
We eat after we wake up. See.

578
00:28:32,583 --> 00:28:32,625
This is just bubble gum.

579
00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:33,791
This is just bubble gum.

580
00:28:34,041 --> 00:28:35,666
I always brush. Get lost.

581
00:28:36,041 --> 00:28:37,416
That's been in his 
mouth for 3 days.

582
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:39,041
You check S.K.'s bag.

583
00:28:39,041 --> 00:28:40,291
There might be paste in there.

584
00:28:40,291 --> 00:28:41,416
You can't touch the bag!

585
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:42,708
Get ready fast. There's no time.

586
00:28:42,791 --> 00:28:43,583
Come.

587
00:28:43,875 --> 00:28:46,500
He might get divorced because of his 
bad breath on the first day itself.

588
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,458
See this.

589
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:49,125
He's wearing the same 
shirt from yesterday.

590
00:28:49,125 --> 00:28:50,750
After all, he's a groom.

591
00:28:50,875 --> 00:28:52,541
Give him one of the two 
shirts you are stuffing in.

592
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:55,791
You are looking at me as if 
I asked for your kidneys.

593
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,166
You don't have to 
worry till I'm here.

594
00:28:58,166 --> 00:29:00,166
You are sure that she 
will come right?

595
00:29:00,583 --> 00:29:01,541
Then this shirt is enough.

596
00:29:01,541 --> 00:29:02,916
Come on, don't you want to go?

597
00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:05,333
Coming.

598
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,625
- What is this? 
- Our ride

599
00:29:15,833 --> 00:29:17,083
How is it?

600
00:29:17,833 --> 00:29:19,583
What car is this? What 
kind of loser are you?

601
00:29:19,583 --> 00:29:20,875
Is this the car we are 
taking the girl in.

602
00:29:20,958 --> 00:29:21,958
What's wrong with this car?

603
00:29:21,958 --> 00:29:22,750
What's wrong?

604
00:29:22,833 --> 00:29:25,583
Why don't you attach a mike 
set and announce our arrival.

605
00:29:25,583 --> 00:29:26,958
The sun light too.

606
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:27,625
Sunlight?

607
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:31,041
Are you guys all playing around. I have no 
time. Where will we go for another car.

608
00:29:31,041 --> 00:29:31,916
I don't know.

609
00:29:40,166 --> 00:29:41,166
There's an innova.

610
00:29:41,166 --> 00:29:41,791
Is that enough?

611
00:29:41,791 --> 00:29:42,958
Yes, that's enough.

612
00:29:42,958 --> 00:29:44,291
- That's enough - But..

613
00:29:44,291 --> 00:29:46,833
It's in Bangalore. Will 
take some time to take it.

614
00:29:46,833 --> 00:29:48,166
I'll lay one on you.

615
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:49,708
He's taking in his 
stupidity with pride.

616
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,625
Atleast I arranged this car.

617
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,375
Now you guys don't start. We 
are off to do something good.

618
00:29:58,791 --> 00:30:00,666
- There's a car. 
- Where?

619
00:30:00,875 --> 00:30:02,291
Of a friend in Moovatupuzha.

620
00:30:02,916 --> 00:30:05,833
But his father won't 
let us have it.

621
00:30:05,875 --> 00:30:07,791
And he isn't that great a liar.

622
00:30:07,875 --> 00:30:11,250
That's not a problem. The person I 
called yesterday is best for all this.

623
00:30:11,375 --> 00:30:11,416
Hello!

624
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,125
Hello!

625
00:30:12,208 --> 00:30:13,375
Lovelesh. Hello!

626
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:15,708
My phone fell in cow 
dung and isn't working.

627
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,333
This is my sisters phone. 
What's the matter?

628
00:30:17,375 --> 00:30:18,708
- Give me my phone back. 
- I'll send you an address..

629
00:30:18,708 --> 00:30:21,500
There will be a guy named Jinto. 
Just tell him you are Vinu's friend.

630
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,458
- Give me my phone. 
- Let me finish this call.

631
00:30:23,458 --> 00:30:23,500
Who is this Vinu?

632
00:30:23,791 --> 00:30:24,500
Who is this Vinu?

633
00:30:24,541 --> 00:30:27,250
I told you yesterday. Angelins boyfriend. 
His name is Vinu.

634
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:31,416
Forget all that. Go to that Jinto's 
house and arrange Thar car somehow.

635
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,625
Arrange car?

636
00:30:32,666 --> 00:30:34,750
- Bike - No car, 
There is four of us.

637
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:39,333
- I don't even know how to drive. 
- Take that Jinto along. We are on the way.

638
00:30:39,458 --> 00:30:39,500
- To Angeline's house. 
- Angeline's house?

639
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,458
- To Angeline's house. 
- Angeline's house?

640
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:46,125
He hung up.

641
00:30:47,708 --> 00:30:47,750
So like how we said. success.

642
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,750
So like how we said. success.

643
00:31:01,583 --> 00:31:01,958
Bro.

644
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:04,375
Who is this?

645
00:31:05,208 --> 00:31:06,166
Come here.

646
00:31:06,375 --> 00:31:07,166
Come here.

647
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,250
Don't pull.

648
00:31:10,375 --> 00:31:10,875
Jinto.

649
00:31:12,541 --> 00:31:12,583
What's the programme?

650
00:31:12,583 --> 00:31:13,750
What's the programme?

651
00:31:13,791 --> 00:31:15,000
Is Vinu actually going 
to do register marriage?

652
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,500
Yeah.

653
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,250
- Yes. 
- Superb.

654
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:17,291
I always wanted to sign witness 
to a register marriage.

655
00:31:17,583 --> 00:31:19,333
I always wanted to sign witness 
to a register marriage.

656
00:31:19,416 --> 00:31:20,541
That's happening now.

657
00:31:21,708 --> 00:31:24,458
But I don't think my father 
will give us the car.

658
00:31:25,166 --> 00:31:25,208
- Why? 
- I just told Vinu when he called.

659
00:31:25,208 --> 00:31:27,541
- Why? 
- I just told Vinu when he called.

660
00:31:27,541 --> 00:31:28,541
Is it?

661
00:31:28,541 --> 00:31:30,500
- What do we do? 
- We'll find some way.

662
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:35,000
Creator, Infant Jesus, Savior.

663
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,000
Does your father have 
any sort of weakness?

664
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:42,125
He does?

665
00:31:45,791 --> 00:31:48,166
Is this the house of 
Varghese the devotee?

666
00:31:48,458 --> 00:31:50,875
This isn't Devdasan's house. 
It's Varghese sir's house.

667
00:31:51,958 --> 00:31:55,625
Child there is no boss or 
worker in the eyes of God.

668
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:55,875
All are gods children.

669
00:31:55,875 --> 00:31:57,250
All are gods children.

670
00:31:57,958 --> 00:31:59,375
Sir!

671
00:31:59,625 --> 00:32:00,833
My name is Paul.

672
00:32:00,833 --> 00:32:01,916
I’m a brother.

673
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:04,416
Father Alexander told 
me to come here.

674
00:32:05,125 --> 00:32:05,750
Sit.

675
00:32:06,083 --> 00:32:07,791
Get something to drink.

676
00:32:07,791 --> 00:32:09,291
If it's Tang. Then no need.

677
00:32:09,291 --> 00:32:10,541
If it's horlicks, then take.

678
00:32:10,791 --> 00:32:11,791
Ohh, okay.

679
00:32:12,041 --> 00:32:13,416
Brother, please tell 
me why you are here.

680
00:32:13,958 --> 00:32:19,041
We had found a perfect mountain in 
Kattapana and placed a cross there..

681
00:32:19,291 --> 00:32:22,625
It's when we were planning to 
arrange a wooden cross by easter.

682
00:32:22,625 --> 00:32:25,166
and make this years 
pilgrimage a bit stronger..

683
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:28,291
that the wild elephants 
destroyed it.

684
00:32:28,791 --> 00:32:31,041
We had also filed a 
complaint against that.

685
00:32:31,541 --> 00:32:33,625
There has been no 
action taken till date.

686
00:32:34,666 --> 00:32:35,916
So for this Christmas

687
00:32:36,666 --> 00:32:42,916
We were planning on conducting 
a huge protest in this matter.

688
00:32:43,541 --> 00:32:44,416
That's great.

689
00:32:44,541 --> 00:32:45,541
Not only that.

690
00:32:45,708 --> 00:32:47,166
Instead of the old wooden cross.

691
00:32:47,416 --> 00:32:50,583
We decided to make 
one out of iron.

692
00:32:51,208 --> 00:32:51,250
We can electrify it. There 
is even a blessing ceremony.

693
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:55,416
We can electrify it. There 
is even a blessing ceremony.

694
00:32:55,958 --> 00:32:56,000
So, what should I 
do about all this

695
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,291
So, what should I 
do about all this

696
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:03,708
You should help us arrange 
a car for the protest.

697
00:33:04,208 --> 00:33:07,583
If it's a white car like 
this, that would be great.

698
00:33:07,958 --> 00:33:09,333
Why a white car?

699
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,958
You are standing here 
without taking my horlicks.

700
00:33:11,958 --> 00:33:15,458
All these years you have been 
wearing this white attire.

701
00:33:15,583 --> 00:33:17,750
Same color code for the priests.

702
00:33:18,125 --> 00:33:20,625
Didn't you get from all this 
what that color means to us.

703
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,291
Okay, I take everything back. 
I'm leaving.

704
00:33:23,375 --> 00:33:25,166
Brother, please don't 
take it the wrong way

705
00:33:25,166 --> 00:33:26,250
Go inside.

706
00:33:27,791 --> 00:33:30,083
It's just because I'm busy.

707
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:33,125
Then to just give away 
the car like that...

708
00:33:33,166 --> 00:33:34,541
You can give it to your son..

709
00:33:34,541 --> 00:33:37,166
Let him also participate 
in the church activities.

710
00:33:37,166 --> 00:33:39,083
He can also participate 
in our youth wing.

711
00:33:39,833 --> 00:33:42,541
But when you say white car...

712
00:33:43,416 --> 00:33:45,583
It has been 2 years 
since it was used.

713
00:33:45,666 --> 00:33:48,166
It's for God. It 
will turn out okay.

714
00:33:48,208 --> 00:33:50,208
I'm also happy about that.

715
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:52,541
Then that is a very lucky car.

716
00:33:52,583 --> 00:33:52,625
Oh lord! Thank you.

717
00:33:52,916 --> 00:33:54,250
Oh lord! Thank you.

718
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:59,166
Only that it hasn't been used for 2 years. 
Anyway you give it a try.

719
00:33:59,333 --> 00:33:59,375
Son, bring that cars key.

720
00:33:59,375 --> 00:34:01,291
Son, bring that cars key.

721
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:06,458
Then I'll be on my way.

722
00:34:06,541 --> 00:34:07,541
May God bless you.

723
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,750
Please send my regards to Father Alexander.

724
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:10,375
Sure.

725
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:14,041
Also tell him to pray for 
our rubber and pineapple.

726
00:34:14,541 --> 00:34:19,916
Why stop there? Will ask him to pray 
for the ginger, pepper and all.

727
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:31,708
Brother, that's not our car.

728
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,583
It isn't?

729
00:34:32,583 --> 00:34:34,125
That's our neighbors car.

730
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:35,708
They parked it here because 
they have no space to.

731
00:34:35,708 --> 00:34:36,833
So, this isn't our car?

732
00:34:36,833 --> 00:34:38,250
Come, I'll show you.

733
00:34:38,583 --> 00:34:39,583
Come.

734
00:34:47,833 --> 00:34:51,083
It was my childhood dream.

735
00:34:51,708 --> 00:34:53,458
To do something thrilling.

736
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:53,958
Is it?

737
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:54,500
Yes.

738
00:34:56,333 --> 00:34:58,041
S.K. do you watch wrestling?

739
00:34:59,000 --> 00:34:59,666
Yes.

740
00:34:59,875 --> 00:35:01,625
There is a Rey Mysterio in that.

741
00:35:01,875 --> 00:35:04,250
I like his spinning 
kick and all.

742
00:35:05,208 --> 00:35:06,791
But still what I like most is..

743
00:35:06,958 --> 00:35:08,375
To see Lalettan's fights.

744
00:35:08,791 --> 00:35:09,500
Super right?

745
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:10,916
- Then what. 
- Right?

746
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:13,416
Then what happened?

747
00:35:15,041 --> 00:35:16,041
What happened..

748
00:35:16,708 --> 00:35:17,791
My father right.

749
00:35:18,666 --> 00:35:20,541
He isn't interested 
in me at all.

750
00:35:20,875 --> 00:35:21,875
No interest at all.

751
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,125
Which wrestler is this?

752
00:35:47,166 --> 00:35:49,750
It isn't about 
fighting but peace.

753
00:35:50,166 --> 00:35:52,750
He single-handedly won our 
country's independence.

754
00:35:54,083 --> 00:35:54,958
Alone?

755
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,500
Alone.

756
00:35:57,041 --> 00:36:01,041
If you are coming to watch Mafia 
come, just don't tell your dad.

757
00:36:01,041 --> 00:36:01,083
Violence is not the 
solution to anything.

758
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:03,458
Violence is not the 
solution to anything.

759
00:36:04,125 --> 00:36:07,083
If someone slaps you on one cheek, 
turn to them the other also.

760
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:09,041
He is the real humanitarian.

761
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:19,041
Your grandfather followed 
the path of peace.

762
00:36:19,916 --> 00:36:19,958
Like Gandhiji.

763
00:36:19,958 --> 00:36:21,166
Like Gandhiji.

764
00:36:21,541 --> 00:36:26,125
So don't get into any 
mess and ruin his name.

765
00:36:27,416 --> 00:36:28,458
The way of peace.

766
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
That's our path.

767
00:37:14,208 --> 00:37:16,166
Brother, this is our car.

768
00:37:18,541 --> 00:37:20,166
He was in Bombay long back.

769
00:37:20,208 --> 00:37:24,666
He was just shining over there with all 
the robberies and crimes back then.

770
00:37:24,666 --> 00:37:27,625
He's over with all the 
blood shed back there.

771
00:37:29,916 --> 00:37:32,916
But in 1996, he was 
banned in Bombay.

772
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:36,083
My father brought him back 
then at a cheap rate.

773
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:42,375
Everything changed once he came.

774
00:37:42,375 --> 00:37:45,833
It was an agricultural life with 
all the coconuts, cow dung, etc.

775
00:37:50,625 --> 00:37:53,458
In the end. He himself 
got left out.

776
00:37:54,166 --> 00:37:56,791
Lovelu. You arranged 
the car right?

777
00:37:57,083 --> 00:37:58,083
Yeah, I got the car.

778
00:37:58,291 --> 00:38:00,125
It's a complete mess here.

779
00:38:00,166 --> 00:38:02,416
I got some real old junk.

780
00:38:02,416 --> 00:38:04,500
Won't the car start?

781
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:07,166
Did you hear a sound now?

782
00:38:08,083 --> 00:38:09,541
This is that car.

783
00:38:09,541 --> 00:38:12,791
We are on our way there, we can't 
use an auto rickshaw for this.

784
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:13,000
Find some way fast.

785
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,583
Find some way fast.

786
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:19,166
What will I do, what if there is 
a police chase when we nab her?

787
00:38:37,875 --> 00:38:41,458
Kidnapping, police, chase..

788
00:39:04,166 --> 00:39:06,166
You guys go directly to the 
register office along with her.

789
00:39:06,208 --> 00:39:08,166
I'll buy the necklace 
and bouquets.

790
00:39:08,291 --> 00:39:08,333
Hello, we are almost there.

791
00:39:08,583 --> 00:39:10,583
Hello, we are almost there.

792
00:39:10,583 --> 00:39:12,541
What about the car, 
is there any hope?

793
00:39:12,916 --> 00:39:15,708
What did you think about me? 
Everything is set here.

794
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,250
Just get an auto and come 
to Angeline's house.

795
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:18,291
- We are on the way. 
- We'll reach in 20 minutes.

796
00:39:18,625 --> 00:39:20,666
- We are on the way. 
- We'll reach in 20 minutes.

797
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:21,333
Come fast.

798
00:39:21,708 --> 00:39:23,083
You know the house right?

799
00:39:23,083 --> 00:39:24,708
Yes, he knows. Right?

800
00:39:24,708 --> 00:39:25,333
Yes.

801
00:39:25,375 --> 00:39:26,125
He knows.

802
00:39:27,208 --> 00:39:28,541
Drive fast, they 
are on their way.

803
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:29,250
What's this?

804
00:39:29,375 --> 00:39:31,875
This was one of my 
biggest desires

805
00:39:32,041 --> 00:39:34,833
To do something for the society? 
It's happening today.

806
00:39:34,833 --> 00:39:36,666
Is it that great to do 
something for the society.

807
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:37,708
Then what?

808
00:39:38,791 --> 00:39:39,791
Where did we reach.

809
00:39:39,791 --> 00:39:42,375
There. Her house. Stop the auto.

810
00:39:42,541 --> 00:39:44,083
Don't make a fuss.

811
00:39:46,291 --> 00:39:47,333
How much is it?

812
00:39:47,375 --> 00:39:48,375
Rs. 30

813
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:53,166
People are staring at us.

814
00:39:53,208 --> 00:39:54,708
Don't panic. Be cool.

815
00:39:55,166 --> 00:39:57,333
S.K. it's 11:30

816
00:39:57,458 --> 00:40:00,000
Did she leave when she 
couldn't find us?

817
00:40:00,125 --> 00:40:02,541
If she can't understand a 30 
min traffic block. Let her go.

818
00:40:02,583 --> 00:40:04,125
We are the one who are late.

819
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:05,625
Why are you blaming her?

820
00:40:05,666 --> 00:40:06,666
They are here.

821
00:40:06,791 --> 00:40:07,458
Get in slowly.

822
00:40:07,458 --> 00:40:09,208
Come.

823
00:40:09,416 --> 00:40:10,958
What are you guys talking about?

824
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:11,875
What?

825
00:40:12,083 --> 00:40:14,083
Won't she get tensed if 
she doesn't see me here.

826
00:40:14,083 --> 00:40:15,708
You don't get tensed now.

827
00:40:15,916 --> 00:40:15,958
Can't even stand properly 
with my feet shaking.

828
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:18,125
Can't even stand properly 
with my feet shaking.

829
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:19,375
Hello, bro.

830
00:40:20,166 --> 00:40:21,500
- Here. 
- He'll come

831
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:22,791
Come.

832
00:40:23,125 --> 00:40:24,333
Come.

833
00:40:24,916 --> 00:40:25,916
S.K.

834
00:40:26,083 --> 00:40:27,083
Bro.

835
00:40:27,666 --> 00:40:29,625
My dear bro, give me that hand.

836
00:40:30,416 --> 00:40:33,791
I knew you would take some 
decision like this earlier.

837
00:40:33,833 --> 00:40:34,416
Decision?

838
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:35,625
Me?

839
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:36,416
Isn't marrying her 
a great decision.

840
00:40:36,416 --> 00:40:38,708
Isn't marrying her 
a great decision.

841
00:40:38,875 --> 00:40:41,375
What's so important about her to 
call the one who marries her great?

842
00:40:41,416 --> 00:40:42,166
Because of her beauty?

843
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,458
Beauty is such a small issue.

844
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,750
I was talking about 
her personality.

845
00:40:46,125 --> 00:40:49,291
Then don't worry at all. I'm not 
the one marrying her. It's him.

846
00:40:49,333 --> 00:40:50,791
- Him? 
- Not him. Him.

847
00:40:50,958 --> 00:40:51,958
Who is that?

848
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:52,291
Isn't your name Vinu?

849
00:40:52,291 --> 00:40:53,416
Isn't your name Vinu?

850
00:40:55,416 --> 00:40:58,208
I though that Vinu was some name they 
gave you because of your personality.

851
00:40:58,250 --> 00:40:59,458
No, no, no. I'm Rahul.

852
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:00,208
Rahul.

853
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:01,791
Hi nice to meet you.

854
00:41:01,875 --> 00:41:04,666
You were talking about her personality. 
What's wrong with her?

855
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:06,791
- Is it? 
- If that was the case. It doesn't effect us.

856
00:41:06,833 --> 00:41:07,791
- No? 
- Then?

857
00:41:07,791 --> 00:41:10,833
- Don't take what I say the wrong way. 
- Say!

858
00:41:11,125 --> 00:41:12,458
- Say. 
- She is trouble!

859
00:41:13,208 --> 00:41:14,333
A goon.

860
00:41:14,416 --> 00:41:14,458
- Look here. 
- Looks like an itch.

861
00:41:14,458 --> 00:41:15,875
- Look here. 
- Looks like an itch.

862
00:41:15,916 --> 00:41:15,958
Get lost.

863
00:41:15,958 --> 00:41:16,583
Get lost.

864
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:17,708
She bit me.

865
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:19,416
Back when she was in school..

866
00:41:19,875 --> 00:41:21,708
saying that I made fun of her..

867
00:41:21,708 --> 00:41:23,583
She smacked me with 
the water bottle.

868
00:41:23,583 --> 00:41:24,583
then a bite.

869
00:41:25,291 --> 00:41:26,041
Bite?

870
00:41:26,708 --> 00:41:27,333
- Yes, bite!

871
00:41:27,333 --> 00:41:28,333
Get lost.

872
00:41:28,875 --> 00:41:30,625
She is just like her family.

873
00:41:30,666 --> 00:41:34,333
Her grandfather has a big gun.

874
00:41:34,333 --> 00:41:38,500
They kill every bird that 
enters their fields.

875
00:41:38,541 --> 00:41:41,958
- I hear those guns are still there. 
- Guns?

876
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:45,791
Then what. They 
even have missiles.

877
00:41:46,041 --> 00:41:48,625
Do we need to take this risk. 
Let's leave.

878
00:41:48,958 --> 00:41:51,208
Yeah right, missile.

879
00:41:51,333 --> 00:41:52,250
Get lost man.

880
00:41:52,291 --> 00:41:54,708
She is not going to come, call him. 
Let's go.

881
00:41:55,875 --> 00:41:59,166
- Get in. 
- Let's go!

882
00:41:59,541 --> 00:42:03,458
S.K. Let's go!

883
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:24,666
You live opposite our 
Thrissur house right?

884
00:42:26,833 --> 00:42:28,083
We have met before.

885
00:42:30,708 --> 00:42:32,833
Who is this? Your friend?

886
00:42:37,291 --> 00:42:38,916
How do you know them?

887
00:42:39,375 --> 00:42:41,166
We studied together in college.

888
00:42:41,208 --> 00:42:42,291
In the same bench.

889
00:42:42,291 --> 00:42:42,916
Oh! Is it/

890
00:42:44,416 --> 00:42:46,541
I don't need to introduce 
myself, right?

891
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:51,000
I wanted to ask you. Why have 
you brought them with you?

892
00:42:52,125 --> 00:42:53,750
You didn't get anyone else?

893
00:42:55,416 --> 00:42:57,125
- What's this? 
- Hi.

894
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,458
Angeline. I'm Jinto.

895
00:42:59,875 --> 00:43:00,958
Nice to meet you

896
00:43:01,166 --> 00:43:02,708
Ugh!

897
00:43:06,416 --> 00:43:07,541
They're here.

898
00:43:10,916 --> 00:43:12,291
Ittupetta, is everything set?

899
00:43:12,291 --> 00:43:14,000
Everything is okay. Where 
is the bride and groom?

900
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:14,541
There.

901
00:43:14,708 --> 00:43:15,541
Come.

902
00:43:15,541 --> 00:43:17,291
Fast. Everyone is 
waiting for you.

903
00:43:17,291 --> 00:43:19,666
Then tell them to bring 
the Nilavillakku too.

904
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:22,458
We planned that first. But then 
left it out because you are here.

905
00:43:22,458 --> 00:43:23,541
You guys come.

906
00:43:23,666 --> 00:43:24,291
Come.

907
00:43:24,416 --> 00:43:26,291
Why are you calling them 
like you signal ducks.

908
00:43:26,291 --> 00:43:27,666
- Come, S.k. you should be there 
- You go.

909
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:29,458
You got what you wanted. 
Now what?

910
00:43:29,541 --> 00:43:30,583
- Right? 
- Go.

911
00:43:30,666 --> 00:43:31,916
- We'll be inside. 
- I'll come.

912
00:43:32,541 --> 00:43:32,583
Come.

913
00:43:32,583 --> 00:43:33,375
Come.

914
00:43:33,416 --> 00:43:34,416
I'm not coming.

915
00:43:34,666 --> 00:43:37,000
Her bloody attitude. She 
said she doesn't know me.

916
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,500
All these years 
of following her.

917
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,583
Am I your friend, she asks.

918
00:43:39,708 --> 00:43:42,708
You are also relieved right? When she 
you made you her brother next door.

919
00:43:43,333 --> 00:43:44,833
Girls are all the same.

920
00:43:46,416 --> 00:43:47,666
I can't bear all this.

921
00:43:48,291 --> 00:43:51,958
You have to understand something. 
Both of us didn't get her.

922
00:43:52,208 --> 00:43:54,708
But 2 hearts are becoming 
one because of us.

923
00:43:56,458 --> 00:43:58,375
A great thing we 
are going to do.

924
00:43:58,708 --> 00:44:01,625
A great opportunity to prove that we 
are not just the dialogues we let out.

925
00:44:01,666 --> 00:44:02,666
Let her go.

926
00:44:03,375 --> 00:44:05,416
Aren't there any 
other girls here?

927
00:44:06,166 --> 00:44:07,958
So you both were behind her?

928
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,375
Take it as a luck 
that she's gone.

929
00:44:10,416 --> 00:44:11,875
Just come.

930
00:44:11,875 --> 00:44:15,916
Which ever country you have to go, 
the law will move in it's own path.

931
00:44:15,916 --> 00:44:15,958
So what should I do about this?

932
00:44:16,166 --> 00:44:18,125
So what should I do about this?

933
00:44:18,208 --> 00:44:24,000
Our children is the biggest evidence. 
Please help us out somehow.

934
00:44:24,083 --> 00:44:26,375
There is no evidence 
that you married.

935
00:44:26,833 --> 00:44:29,375
Is it from this office 
you create those proofs?

936
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:32,000
How long have been saying 
to you that we are married.

937
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,708
What more proof do you need?

938
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:36,541
You can come to our place and 
enquirer if you have doubts.

939
00:44:37,375 --> 00:44:38,666
It's trouble here.

940
00:44:38,958 --> 00:44:41,458
Will they ask proof of whether 
they are in love or not.

941
00:44:42,125 --> 00:44:46,000
Even I haven't believed his half bottle 
petrol and 23 days story. Then how will he?

942
00:44:46,041 --> 00:44:47,041
See..

943
00:44:47,166 --> 00:44:49,500
Don't make up stories. 
Understand?

944
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,541
If you have proof, bring it.

945
00:44:52,833 --> 00:44:54,000
Come, Let's go.

946
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:56,291
- Next - Move.

947
00:44:59,666 --> 00:45:01,958
Is this a flower 
shop or a bakery?

948
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:04,250
Take this away!

949
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:07,791
Must be love marriage.

950
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:11,458
Certificate.

951
00:45:13,583 --> 00:45:14,333
Give it.

952
00:45:23,416 --> 00:45:29,916
Hindi exam, Course completion, NSS. 
Good there is catechism also.

953
00:45:30,208 --> 00:45:31,875
Have you applied for a job here?

954
00:45:32,125 --> 00:45:32,666
No.

955
00:45:33,208 --> 00:45:35,000
Should I arrange some job now?

956
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,083
First marriage. The 
rest we can do later.

957
00:45:37,458 --> 00:45:37,500
With what?

958
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:38,750
With what?

959
00:45:39,041 --> 00:45:39,083
Where is the birth certificate?

960
00:45:39,083 --> 00:45:40,875
Where is the birth certificate?

961
00:45:44,125 --> 00:45:46,875
Forget that, do you atleast 
have your SSLC book?

962
00:45:46,875 --> 00:45:49,166
No, That's in mummy's cupboard.

963
00:45:49,333 --> 00:45:50,916
There was no way to take it.

964
00:45:50,958 --> 00:45:53,416
Let's do one thing. 
Let's go home.

965
00:45:54,041 --> 00:45:54,083
Let's do this marriage there.

966
00:45:54,083 --> 00:45:55,458
Let's do this marriage there.

967
00:45:55,458 --> 00:45:56,916
That is not necessary sir.

968
00:45:56,916 --> 00:45:58,666
They have issues each 
others families.

969
00:45:58,708 --> 00:46:00,833
You will only make a fool 
of yourself going there.

970
00:46:00,833 --> 00:46:02,125
Here itself is enough.

971
00:46:02,125 --> 00:46:04,083
You guys are educated?

972
00:46:04,583 --> 00:46:07,583
You don't know what documents are 
required for registering a marriage?

973
00:46:08,583 --> 00:46:09,666
- Ladoo - Dear.

974
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,500
Bring that certificate first.

975
00:46:11,791 --> 00:46:13,125
Then we can think about it.

976
00:46:13,166 --> 00:46:14,666
To let this marriage 
happen or not.

977
00:46:14,708 --> 00:46:15,708
Sir.. Sir..

978
00:46:16,083 --> 00:46:20,541
If by this we two people come together. 
Isn't that a blessing for us?

979
00:46:25,333 --> 00:46:28,041
Sir, some adjustment.

980
00:46:28,083 --> 00:46:29,083
You!

981
00:46:29,083 --> 00:46:30,500
You guys have a thought..

982
00:46:30,708 --> 00:46:32,791
That all government 
employees are corrupt.

983
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:33,208
Really?

984
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:36,125
This is enough to report 
you to the police.

985
00:46:37,625 --> 00:46:40,500
So don't play around 
much and leave.

986
00:46:42,791 --> 00:46:45,666
Dear, shouldn't you 
have taken all this?

987
00:46:45,916 --> 00:46:47,291
My mom is like CCTV.

988
00:46:47,333 --> 00:46:48,708
Where ever I go, 
she'll follow me.

989
00:46:50,666 --> 00:46:51,916
Isn't driving license enough?

990
00:46:52,375 --> 00:46:54,083
But I don't have any license.

991
00:46:55,541 --> 00:46:58,541
I doubt he'll even do it after 
getting those documents.

992
00:46:58,541 --> 00:47:00,083
How, you are to blame.

993
00:47:00,125 --> 00:47:02,666
- His adjustment. 
- What did you ask him earlier?

994
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,875
What language was that?

995
00:47:05,875 --> 00:47:05,916
What?

996
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:06,666
What?

997
00:47:06,708 --> 00:47:08,875
let me see how much did you 
give for helping your friend?

998
00:47:08,916 --> 00:47:11,083
- Rs. 170? 
- Rs. 170

999
00:47:11,125 --> 00:47:13,291
If he had seen this, he would 
have reported us that instant.

1000
00:47:13,375 --> 00:47:15,541
Calling us bribers. 
What a failure you are.

1001
00:47:17,083 --> 00:47:19,000
I don't feel so good 
about all this.

1002
00:47:19,875 --> 00:47:22,541
They are here to marry 
without any certificates.

1003
00:47:22,625 --> 00:47:23,625
I'll say one best idea.

1004
00:47:23,666 --> 00:47:24,041
Say.

1005
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:29,000
After 2 days, when everything is settled. 
We'll take the certificates and come back.

1006
00:47:29,041 --> 00:47:30,666
- Correct. 
- No, I can't do that.

1007
00:47:30,666 --> 00:47:31,666
I need to do it today itself.

1008
00:47:31,708 --> 00:47:33,583
- Why today? 
- It's like that.

1009
00:47:33,916 --> 00:47:38,875
If you leave documents back 
home, will this marriage happen

1010
00:47:39,458 --> 00:47:41,291
S.K. lets call Suresh ettan.

1011
00:47:41,416 --> 00:47:42,708
He's good at such things.

1012
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:45,125
Nothing will happen without 
those certificates.

1013
00:47:45,166 --> 00:47:46,000
That's right.

1014
00:47:48,583 --> 00:47:51,541
The friend whose 
last hope is S.K.

1015
00:47:52,291 --> 00:47:56,416
And the helpless face of the girl 
he thought he would marry one day..

1016
00:47:56,875 --> 00:47:58,583
Created a new spark in S.K.

1017
00:47:59,375 --> 00:48:00,000
One idea.

1018
00:48:01,125 --> 00:48:03,458
- Angeline, please come outside 
- Why?

1019
00:48:03,916 --> 00:48:04,958
Now it's 3pm

1020
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:05,875
So?

1021
00:48:05,875 --> 00:48:07,125
The register office 
is open till 5pm.

1022
00:48:07,125 --> 00:48:08,291
we have totally 2 hours.

1023
00:48:08,333 --> 00:48:10,166
Half an hour to go 
there and back here.

1024
00:48:10,458 --> 00:48:13,041
If she can take all the 
certificates in this 30 minutes.

1025
00:48:13,041 --> 00:48:14,500
We can register by 4:30

1026
00:48:14,541 --> 00:48:16,916
Till that Ittup should make sure that 
the Registrar doesn't go anywhere.

1027
00:48:16,916 --> 00:48:17,875
Me?

1028
00:48:17,875 --> 00:48:19,083
has he gone mad?

1029
00:48:19,083 --> 00:48:22,208
- To get her back to the house she ran away from? 
- No other way.

1030
00:48:22,208 --> 00:48:25,083
How can we get them in 30 min what 
they couldn’t do all this time?

1031
00:48:25,125 --> 00:48:25,916
We can.

1032
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,208
I'll take it.

1033
00:48:28,416 --> 00:48:30,750
Then there’s no more 
time to waste.

1034
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:33,583
Let's make things fast. Those 
who are scared can stay here.

1035
00:48:33,625 --> 00:48:34,625
Move aside.

1036
00:48:35,708 --> 00:48:37,583
Rahul, are you also leaving?

1037
00:48:47,916 --> 00:48:50,333
We are already 10 minutes late.

1038
00:48:50,333 --> 00:48:52,250
- We need a plan. 
- Yes.

1039
00:48:52,833 --> 00:48:56,333
We can expect the same block on the way back. 
So that's all the time we have. 10 minutes.

1040
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:59,208
Are you sure you can take 
everything in those 10 minutes.

1041
00:48:59,250 --> 00:48:59,750
Are you?

1042
00:49:00,833 --> 00:49:01,541
Are you?

1043
00:49:02,166 --> 00:49:03,333
Why aren't you saying anything?

1044
00:49:04,041 --> 00:49:04,375
Say.

1045
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:05,541
What is it?

1046
00:49:05,583 --> 00:49:06,291
Whats the problem?

1047
00:49:06,291 --> 00:49:08,166
Don't make her nervous, 
she will take it.

1048
00:49:09,333 --> 00:49:09,916
I'll come.

1049
00:49:13,125 --> 00:49:15,083
Be patient. Let her take it

1050
00:49:17,291 --> 00:49:19,458
Don't make me nervous. She 
doesn't have this much tension.

1051
00:49:23,875 --> 00:49:28,625
Do they still have guns? They 
have rented it to someone else.

1052
00:49:29,291 --> 00:49:29,333
Or else will I be this scared?

1053
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:30,625
Or else will I be this scared?

1054
00:49:30,791 --> 00:49:35,208
If it was a double barrel, we might 
get a gap to escape between shots.

1055
00:49:35,208 --> 00:49:38,625
If it's the other gun. 
6 bullets and 5 of us.

1056
00:49:38,958 --> 00:49:39,791
We will definitely get shot.

1057
00:49:39,833 --> 00:49:41,583
Bro, don't scare us.

1058
00:49:41,666 --> 00:49:43,500
Even I'm scared.

1059
00:49:44,041 --> 00:49:46,000
Take this as a thrill.

1060
00:49:46,541 --> 00:49:49,083
This is all you are. Pity.

1061
00:49:49,375 --> 00:49:51,125
Should have done after 2 days.

1062
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:53,791
He and his terrible plan.

1063
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:55,291
Where are you going.

1064
00:49:55,291 --> 00:49:56,458
Where are you going.

1065
00:49:56,500 --> 00:50:00,375
You don't need to go through all this 
trouble for me. I'll deal with it.

1066
00:50:00,416 --> 00:50:02,666
If so, did we have 
to come this far?

1067
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:05,166
I have told you many times not to 
interfere in unwanted matters.

1068
00:50:05,166 --> 00:50:06,708
You should have left then 
itself if you're afraid.

1069
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:09,000
Let's go home.

1070
00:50:09,083 --> 00:50:10,125
Try to understand.

1071
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:10,291
Stop!

1072
00:50:10,291 --> 00:50:12,250
Stop!

1073
00:50:12,291 --> 00:50:12,916
Move.

1074
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:15,833
Just come here.

1075
00:50:15,833 --> 00:50:16,333
S.K.

1076
00:50:16,375 --> 00:50:17,750
I won't come unless she is here.

1077
00:50:17,791 --> 00:50:20,708
We can't just bring her outside. 
You just come.

1078
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,208
I simply said those things. 
Get in the car.

1079
00:50:23,291 --> 00:50:24,041
S.K.

1080
00:50:24,083 --> 00:50:24,541
Walk.

1081
00:50:26,708 --> 00:50:27,500
Get in.

1082
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,333
- Take the car - Where to?

1083
00:50:29,375 --> 00:50:30,208
Inside.

1084
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:31,375
Gun!

1085
00:50:31,375 --> 00:50:32,583
Forget all that. Take the car.

1086
00:50:32,583 --> 00:50:33,791
You leave him and get inside.

1087
00:50:33,833 --> 00:50:35,083
But I don't know how to drive.

1088
00:50:35,166 --> 00:50:36,708
Do everyone do this 
because they know it.

1089
00:50:36,791 --> 00:50:37,958
It's just this far.

1090
00:50:38,083 --> 00:50:38,125
You get in and you get out.

1091
00:50:38,125 --> 00:50:39,583
You get in and you get out.

1092
00:50:39,625 --> 00:50:39,666
Get out of the car.

1093
00:50:39,666 --> 00:50:41,041
Get out of the car.

1094
00:50:41,375 --> 00:50:43,000
Get out, move.

1095
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:44,250
There's nothing to 
think about now.

1096
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:46,541
We go inside, take 
her and leave.

1097
00:50:50,375 --> 00:50:52,125
Don't off it.

1098
00:50:52,625 --> 00:50:54,375
- Mummy leave it. 
- Where are you going with that?

1099
00:50:54,583 --> 00:50:55,666
Where are you going with that?

1100
00:50:55,708 --> 00:50:57,458
Why do you want to know that?

1101
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:31,083
Enough! Stop!

1102
00:51:31,958 --> 00:51:34,208
Fast, bring her. Go.

1103
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,166
The door isn't opening.

1104
00:51:37,333 --> 00:51:40,500
- I'm doing it. 
- Get down.

1105
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:43,250
You. Come here.

1106
00:51:44,041 --> 00:51:46,500
Get inside the car.

1107
00:51:46,958 --> 00:51:48,208
Open the door.

1108
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,291
S.K. start the car.

1109
00:51:53,166 --> 00:51:55,291
- Don't call out the names. 
- Take the car.

1110
00:51:56,125 --> 00:51:58,375
- Take the car. 
- Go, go, go.

1111
00:52:44,375 --> 00:52:47,250
We are finished. These 
people will murder us.

1112
00:52:47,583 --> 00:52:49,000
Take it. SK take the car.

1113
00:52:50,291 --> 00:52:52,416
What are you doing? 
You go behind.

1114
00:52:52,416 --> 00:52:55,208
- How do we go in reverse? 
- Do like this.

1115
00:52:55,208 --> 00:52:58,833
- Why can't you take it then? 
- Move aside.

1116
00:52:58,833 --> 00:53:00,166
Fast. Move.

1117
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:02,708
Oh lord!

1118
00:53:07,875 --> 00:53:10,000
Oh god! It's all over.

1119
00:53:10,083 --> 00:53:12,333
They must have definitely 
noted our number plate.

1120
00:53:12,333 --> 00:53:15,458
Jinto. People will come asking 
about this car right away.

1121
00:53:16,083 --> 00:53:18,125
That's not an issue. Lovelesh 
ettan has taken care of it.

1122
00:53:18,875 --> 00:53:18,916
Boss!

1123
00:53:18,916 --> 00:53:20,000
Boss!

1124
00:53:20,708 --> 00:53:23,500
So you had decided 
on all this earlier?

1125
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:26,458
I'm afraid if her uncles 
will for us with guns.

1126
00:53:26,791 --> 00:53:28,083
Guns? What guns?

1127
00:53:28,166 --> 00:53:30,041
We know all about your family.

1128
00:53:30,041 --> 00:53:32,458
- Rahulettan. 
- How are they gonna kill us.

1129
00:53:32,833 --> 00:53:34,458
Will they light this 
whole car on fire?

1130
00:53:34,458 --> 00:53:36,875
Say, you tell me. I'm 
scared that's why.

1131
00:53:36,916 --> 00:53:38,500
My family won't do a thing.

1132
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,666
They don't even own a pen knife.

1133
00:53:40,708 --> 00:53:42,166
Let alone guns.

1134
00:53:42,208 --> 00:53:44,750
There were guns, right?

1135
00:53:45,666 --> 00:53:47,458
My uncle is the 
only problem now.

1136
00:53:48,041 --> 00:53:50,208
He might come at any moment.

1137
00:53:50,625 --> 00:53:51,875
Police?

1138
00:53:52,625 --> 00:53:53,958
Didn't you see the 
message I send?

1139
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,708
Her uncle is a CI.

1140
00:53:57,291 --> 00:54:00,916
You should have used 
a space after uncle.

1141
00:54:00,916 --> 00:54:02,958
You idiot.

1142
00:54:03,458 --> 00:54:06,125
Which area CI did 
you say he was?

1143
00:55:13,625 --> 00:55:14,625
Hello.

1144
00:55:19,041 --> 00:55:19,583
I'll come.

1145
00:55:19,583 --> 00:55:21,041
Stop right here.

1146
00:55:21,666 --> 00:55:23,041
Finally they are here.

1147
00:55:23,208 --> 00:55:25,333
- Come fast. 
- Get down fast.

1148
00:55:26,833 --> 00:55:27,541
Come.

1149
00:55:28,708 --> 00:55:29,958
I'll open, wait.

1150
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,583
Are they breaking the door open?

1151
00:55:31,833 --> 00:55:32,875
Where were you?

1152
00:55:32,916 --> 00:55:33,833
Not me, they were late.

1153
00:55:33,833 --> 00:55:36,250
Ittupetta, do you know 
who her uncle is?

1154
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:36,833
No.

1155
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:38,833
You always talk about 
that Tamizhan C.I.

1156
00:55:38,875 --> 00:55:39,625
That two eyed police?

1157
00:55:40,208 --> 00:55:40,250
My god.

1158
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:40,833
My god.

1159
00:55:40,875 --> 00:55:41,291
Hello

1160
00:55:41,333 --> 00:55:42,250
I have a doubt.

1161
00:55:42,375 --> 00:55:43,875
Everyone has 2 eyes right?

1162
00:55:44,125 --> 00:55:45,208
Then why did you 
call him two-eyed?

1163
00:55:45,291 --> 00:55:47,000
Not only 2 eyes, 2...

1164
00:55:47,041 --> 00:55:47,916
There is a girl here.

1165
00:55:47,958 --> 00:55:48,458
Hi.

1166
00:55:48,625 --> 00:55:50,000
Who is this rabbit face?

1167
00:55:50,041 --> 00:55:50,791
His friend.

1168
00:55:50,833 --> 00:55:52,125
Not only mine, his too.

1169
00:55:52,125 --> 00:55:53,000
Whatever.

1170
00:55:53,041 --> 00:55:54,875
Go inside or he will leave.

1171
00:55:55,041 --> 00:55:56,041
- Come. 
- Do we have to?

1172
00:55:56,083 --> 00:55:56,750
Come!

1173
00:55:58,583 --> 00:55:59,750
S.K. He's leaving.

1174
00:56:00,166 --> 00:56:00,208
- Come fast - Sir!

1175
00:56:00,208 --> 00:56:01,166
- Come fast - Sir!

1176
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:03,125
- Sir. 
- Please don't leave sir.

1177
00:56:03,166 --> 00:56:03,958
- Sir. 
- Please don't leave sir.

1178
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,375
Can't you understand 
what I said?

1179
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:09,875
By the time you complete the form 
it will become around 5:30pm

1180
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:11,500
We can do this tomorrow too.

1181
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:13,583
Government offices have 
to be closed by 5pm.

1182
00:56:13,625 --> 00:56:17,875
Sir, I'm sure you won't reach at 10:30am 
so there's no problem doing this now.

1183
00:56:18,916 --> 00:56:19,958
So you are targeting me now?

1184
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,833
Sir, please help sir.

1185
00:56:21,833 --> 00:56:23,333
- It's that urgent. 
- It won't happen today.

1186
00:56:23,375 --> 00:56:25,791
Please sir, if this marriage doesn’t 
happen. It will be a huge mess.

1187
00:56:25,833 --> 00:56:26,583
I'll beg if you want

1188
00:56:26,625 --> 00:56:29,583
A van full of idiots have 
come over with ladoos.

1189
00:56:29,666 --> 00:56:31,041
To marry your friend.

1190
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:34,583
No matter what you do, this 
marriage won't happen today.

1191
00:56:35,875 --> 00:56:37,875
- Sir, please don't say that. 
- Then how should I say it?

1192
00:56:37,875 --> 00:56:39,916
Does the law work 
around your comfort?

1193
00:56:40,666 --> 00:56:42,958
After registering according 
to the special marriage act.

1194
00:56:42,958 --> 00:56:43,958
You see that notice board.

1195
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
This one?

1196
00:56:45,083 --> 00:56:48,708
There will be a notice put on that board 
for 30 days with both your photos.

1197
00:56:48,708 --> 00:56:51,958
Only if it's confirmed that no one has any 
objections, will this marriage happen.

1198
00:56:52,166 --> 00:56:52,833
What?

1199
00:56:53,541 --> 00:56:54,458
Registration.

1200
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:56,666
Sir, what if for 
that 30 days notice.

1201
00:56:57,250 --> 00:57:00,291
If I say that I witnessed this marriage. 
Won't this happen?

1202
00:57:00,416 --> 00:57:00,458
What's you name?

1203
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:01,500
What's you name?

1204
00:57:02,333 --> 00:57:02,375
Jinto.

1205
00:57:02,375 --> 00:57:03,333
Jinto.

1206
00:57:03,833 --> 00:57:04,791
What do you do?

1207
00:57:05,166 --> 00:57:07,208
Right now, I'm trying to 
do something for society.

1208
00:57:07,208 --> 00:57:07,250
I'm with lovlesh ettan now.

1209
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:08,500
I'm with lovlesh ettan now.

1210
00:57:08,916 --> 00:57:09,375
Great.

1211
00:57:09,416 --> 00:57:10,041
With me?

1212
00:57:10,125 --> 00:57:10,666
Right?

1213
00:57:10,833 --> 00:57:11,916
Then you guys stand here.

1214
00:57:11,958 --> 00:57:13,291
I'll call the police.

1215
00:57:13,291 --> 00:57:14,750
Sir please sir, don't do that.

1216
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:15,541
You guys still don't get it.

1217
00:57:16,208 --> 00:57:16,791
Get lost.

1218
00:57:19,958 --> 00:57:20,958
It's all over.

1219
00:57:21,208 --> 00:57:22,625
Now two-eyes might 
know everything.

1220
00:57:22,791 --> 00:57:23,916
We are in trouble now.

1221
00:57:51,041 --> 00:57:53,000
The Tyre marks of the car.

1222
00:58:02,291 --> 00:58:03,250
Tata Sumo.

1223
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:05,041
It was a big car right?

1224
00:58:05,041 --> 00:58:06,125
It was a big car right?

1225
00:58:08,875 --> 00:58:09,875
The car..

1226
00:58:09,958 --> 00:58:10,708
Was it big?

1227
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:13,291
Sir is asking if 
it was a big car?

1228
00:58:13,333 --> 00:58:13,833
No.

1229
00:58:13,916 --> 00:58:15,250
A small car.

1230
00:58:16,125 --> 00:58:16,166
Small car?

1231
00:58:16,166 --> 00:58:17,125
Small car?

1232
00:58:28,625 --> 00:58:29,625
Nano?

1233
00:58:35,625 --> 00:58:37,250
Just come, I'll 
give you the rest.

1234
00:58:41,166 --> 00:58:42,416
What are you doing?

1235
00:58:42,458 --> 00:58:43,958
Isn't it a girls life?

1236
00:58:44,041 --> 00:58:46,000
Shouldn't all this 
be done discreetly?

1237
00:58:46,708 --> 00:58:46,750
How do I investigate 
without the details?

1238
00:58:46,750 --> 00:58:48,791
How do I investigate 
without the details?

1239
00:58:49,291 --> 00:58:50,708
Evidence is very 
important for police.

1240
00:58:51,416 --> 00:58:51,458
Started,

1241
00:58:51,458 --> 00:58:52,416
Started,

1242
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:53,041
Sister.

1243
00:58:53,041 --> 00:58:53,500
Sister.

1244
00:58:54,125 --> 00:58:56,000
I might be your brother-in-law..

1245
00:58:56,375 --> 00:58:58,000
But when it comes to duty.

1246
00:58:58,041 --> 00:58:59,875
No one can stop me.

1247
00:59:00,375 --> 00:59:02,958
Co-operate with me by 
telling what you know.

1248
00:59:03,416 --> 00:59:05,333
Evidence is very 
important for police.

1249
00:59:06,083 --> 00:59:07,416
Again with the evidence.

1250
00:59:07,583 --> 00:59:10,458
All this fuzz to find a runaway?

1251
00:59:11,125 --> 00:59:12,625
I might just say something.

1252
00:59:12,833 --> 00:59:14,583
Atleast tell them 
to off the light.

1253
00:59:16,625 --> 00:59:19,625
First of all, off that siren.

1254
00:59:19,958 --> 00:59:20,000
Off that light.

1255
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:20,958
Off that light.

1256
00:59:23,166 --> 00:59:23,208
Ran away?

1257
00:59:23,333 --> 00:59:24,291
Ran away?

1258
00:59:24,833 --> 00:59:25,833
With whom?

1259
00:59:26,958 --> 00:59:27,666
Great.

1260
00:59:28,166 --> 00:59:29,875
I called you here to 
find exactly that.

1261
00:59:29,875 --> 00:59:31,708
If I knew, would I 
have called you?

1262
00:59:35,041 --> 00:59:36,041
Sister.

1263
00:59:36,541 --> 00:59:37,541
Don't worry.

1264
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:39,500
Even if I lose my life.

1265
00:59:40,083 --> 00:59:41,750
I won't let anything 
destroy our family name.

1266
00:59:43,333 --> 00:59:44,791
I'll be back with her.

1267
00:59:49,458 --> 00:59:51,083
Why are you eating like this?

1268
00:59:51,083 --> 00:59:53,791
4 ladoos is all I 
have had today.

1269
00:59:54,375 --> 00:59:55,458
This is just a trick.

1270
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:57,625
That registrar just wants 
to make money out of this.

1271
00:59:57,625 --> 01:00:00,083
What trick? Then why 
didn't he take my money?

1272
01:00:00,541 --> 01:00:03,416
S.K. please don't talk more 
about your bribe. Please.

1273
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:04,708
170 rupees.

1274
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,416
He will use that to marry 
his elder daughter off.

1275
01:00:06,416 --> 01:00:07,250
Get lost.

1276
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:09,416
We should have just called 
Suresh ettan in the first place.

1277
01:00:09,416 --> 01:00:11,083
By the way, who is 
this Sureshettan?

1278
01:00:11,083 --> 01:00:15,083
If it goes on like this, not only will this 
marriage not happen but I might get a divorce too.

1279
01:00:15,125 --> 01:00:16,500
I'm off to see my wife.

1280
01:00:17,708 --> 01:00:18,916
Son, please stop.

1281
01:00:19,375 --> 01:00:19,916
Stop.

1282
01:00:21,166 --> 01:00:23,125
I'll go to Thrissur and 
clean up the house.

1283
01:00:23,166 --> 01:00:24,833
You try to do something 
about them before that.

1284
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:25,041
If nothing happens, come straight there. 
They can stay there.

1285
01:00:25,041 --> 01:00:27,875
If nothing happens, come straight there. 
They can stay there.

1286
01:00:27,875 --> 01:00:29,000
Head straight to Thrissur.

1287
01:00:29,041 --> 01:00:29,916
Thrissur?

1288
01:00:29,958 --> 01:00:31,916
I was just joking. Head 
to the next junction.

1289
01:00:31,916 --> 01:00:32,500
Catch.

1290
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:47,500
Will this work out?

1291
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:49,750
Hello!

1292
01:00:50,041 --> 01:00:51,833
- Suresh ettan, this is me. 
- Who?

1293
01:00:51,875 --> 01:00:54,416
It's me, didn't you recognize. 
It's me.

1294
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:55,500
Who is this me?

1295
01:00:56,125 --> 01:00:57,166
Are you at home?

1296
01:00:57,208 --> 01:00:57,875
Yes.

1297
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,125
We are on the way there.

1298
01:00:59,166 --> 01:01:01,291
- Hello! 
- Jinto, start the car. Let's go.

1299
01:01:07,916 --> 01:01:08,916
Black Nano?

1300
01:01:09,625 --> 01:01:11,583
They said it was a white car.

1301
01:01:11,958 --> 01:01:12,750
Who said?

1302
01:01:13,083 --> 01:01:14,125
This blue shirt.

1303
01:01:14,291 --> 01:01:14,333
Yes sir, white car.

1304
01:01:14,333 --> 01:01:15,583
Yes sir, white car.

1305
01:01:17,541 --> 01:01:18,583
Note down the color change.

1306
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:22,250
Color change.

1307
01:01:23,875 --> 01:01:25,041
White Nano.

1308
01:01:26,166 --> 01:01:29,458
It wasn't a Nano. The car they use 
as Ambulance in health centers.

1309
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:30,875
- Omni. 
- Yes Omni.

1310
01:01:31,208 --> 01:01:32,958
Bibin has taken 
then photo right?

1311
01:01:32,958 --> 01:01:33,958
Who is this Bibin?

1312
01:01:36,333 --> 01:01:37,333
Here sir.

1313
01:01:44,541 --> 01:01:46,166
Where is the car in this?

1314
01:01:49,958 --> 01:01:53,000
If I ever see you 
around here again..

1315
01:01:53,666 --> 01:01:55,625
You won't even have a 
photo on Facebook.

1316
01:01:57,125 --> 01:01:57,541
Catch.

1317
01:01:58,500 --> 01:01:59,250
Get lost.

1318
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:00,500
Go to your home.

1319
01:02:02,041 --> 01:02:02,666
So..

1320
01:02:02,958 --> 01:02:03,000
White Omni van.

1321
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,208
White Omni van.

1322
01:02:05,416 --> 01:02:07,875
Let me see how it 
crosses my circle

1323
01:02:09,208 --> 01:02:10,541
- Come. 
- Yes, sir.

1324
01:02:11,041 --> 01:02:11,083
If he agrees then we are saved.

1325
01:02:11,083 --> 01:02:13,000
If he agrees then we are saved.

1326
01:02:13,083 --> 01:02:14,041
Then there's no looking back.

1327
01:02:14,375 --> 01:02:16,416
He has arranged around 
2000 marriages.

1328
01:02:16,541 --> 01:02:16,583
2000?

1329
01:02:16,708 --> 01:02:17,208
2000?

1330
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:20,000
He has a whole group just 
for things like this.

1331
01:02:20,583 --> 01:02:21,250
Rahul..

1332
01:02:21,375 --> 01:02:23,875
He even set the marriage of 
Chennai Minister's daughter.

1333
01:02:23,875 --> 01:02:25,000
No one questioned him.

1334
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,375
- Do you know. 
- Then what.

1335
01:02:26,375 --> 01:02:28,541
People in Tamil Nadu 
call him Shahjahan.

1336
01:02:28,833 --> 01:02:29,666
Shahjahan?

1337
01:02:29,833 --> 01:02:29,875
Yes, Vijay's film Shahjahan.

1338
01:02:29,875 --> 01:02:31,333
Yes, Vijay's film Shahjahan.

1339
01:02:31,375 --> 01:02:32,083
It's about him.

1340
01:02:32,125 --> 01:02:33,791
But Sureshettan hasn't 
told me any of this.

1341
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:35,500
He's just bluffing. I don't 
think this will work out.

1342
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:36,875
You just keep quiet. 
Say the rest.

1343
01:02:36,875 --> 01:02:38,041
There is nothing more to tell. 
We have reached his house.

1344
01:02:38,041 --> 01:02:38,083
This one?

1345
01:02:38,208 --> 01:02:38,833
This one?

1346
01:02:38,916 --> 01:02:39,583
Come.

1347
01:02:41,333 --> 01:02:42,333
Sureshetta.

1348
01:02:42,875 --> 01:02:43,875
He'll come now.

1349
01:02:48,041 --> 01:02:49,958
We are here for Suresh ettan.

1350
01:02:50,666 --> 01:02:50,708
Suresh!

1351
01:02:50,708 --> 01:02:51,500
Suresh!

1352
01:02:51,833 --> 01:02:52,833
What is it mother?

1353
01:02:52,875 --> 01:02:55,791
Some runaways are 
here to see you.

1354
01:02:58,208 --> 01:03:00,208
This mother is 
reading our faces.

1355
01:03:00,250 --> 01:03:02,208
You better shut up or 
that face will change.

1356
01:03:02,291 --> 01:03:05,125
It will look like Kabeesh 
after the beating.

1357
01:03:08,375 --> 01:03:10,416
Sureshetta, they are the 
ones I told you about.

1358
01:03:10,416 --> 01:03:13,291
If you are going to take 
over such case then..

1359
01:03:13,625 --> 01:03:14,375
Suresh!

1360
01:03:14,375 --> 01:03:14,958
Mother!

1361
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:17,708
I know what to do. 
You just keep quiet.

1362
01:03:17,958 --> 01:03:19,166
He never listens.

1363
01:03:19,166 --> 01:03:20,333
Off to help the people.

1364
01:03:20,625 --> 01:03:21,708
You guys come in.

1365
01:03:24,458 --> 01:03:26,666
It's not that I don't 
understand what you are saying,

1366
01:03:26,666 --> 01:03:28,208
I have also done 
marriages at night.

1367
01:03:28,625 --> 01:03:31,833
But there is nothing I can 
do in this situation.

1368
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,583
My life is ruined 
because of all this.

1369
01:03:36,041 --> 01:03:36,083
And by the way I have 
a job ready at gulf.

1370
01:03:36,083 --> 01:03:38,583
And by the way I have 
a job ready at gulf.

1371
01:03:38,583 --> 01:03:38,625
The passport verification and 
all will be happening soon.

1372
01:03:38,833 --> 01:03:41,416
The passport verification and 
all will be happening soon.

1373
01:03:41,416 --> 01:03:45,708
If I get stuck between 
a police case now..

1374
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:45,791
It will be a mess. That's why.

1375
01:03:45,791 --> 01:03:47,375
It will be a mess. That's why.

1376
01:03:47,750 --> 01:03:50,333
Lovelesh. Please 
find some other way.

1377
01:03:51,083 --> 01:03:52,291
Sureshetta, somehow..

1378
01:03:52,333 --> 01:03:54,583
See, if you are expecting tea..

1379
01:03:54,791 --> 01:03:55,625
Then don't..

1380
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:57,750
There is no tea 
powder or sugar here.

1381
01:03:57,791 --> 01:04:00,416
And I have no intention 
of making Tang now.

1382
01:04:00,416 --> 01:04:02,041
Mom, just go sit 
there somewhere.

1383
01:04:02,083 --> 01:04:03,291
Go watch that Karuthamuthu. Go.

1384
01:04:03,291 --> 01:04:06,333
Suresh, you are very innocent.

1385
01:04:06,916 --> 01:04:08,916
Please you just 
get rid off them.

1386
01:04:08,958 --> 01:04:12,083
Just when my son is making 
something of his life.

1387
01:04:12,333 --> 01:04:12,375
All of you get out.

1388
01:04:12,375 --> 01:04:13,333
All of you get out.

1389
01:04:13,375 --> 01:04:14,916
My dear mother, please. Go.

1390
01:04:16,333 --> 01:04:16,375
They just barge in.

1391
01:04:16,375 --> 01:04:17,666
They just barge in.

1392
01:04:18,875 --> 01:04:20,416
Don't take it the wrong way.

1393
01:04:20,416 --> 01:04:22,208
She is angry at me. 
Nothing else.

1394
01:04:22,416 --> 01:04:22,458
It's okay sir.

1395
01:04:22,458 --> 01:04:23,416
It's okay sir.

1396
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:26,250
Two love birds that 
are moving away.

1397
01:04:26,291 --> 01:04:28,333
We are here to get 
them back together.

1398
01:04:29,791 --> 01:04:32,291
we forgot that every leaf 
will rot away in the end.

1399
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:35,333
We had a small hope 
when we came here.

1400
01:04:35,791 --> 01:04:37,458
It's okay sir. it's okay.

1401
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,333
- It's because the situation is like this. 
- S.K. let's not trouble him.

1402
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,833
Like S.K. said, we had 
lots of hope coming here.

1403
01:04:49,583 --> 01:04:52,250
But that's okay. 
Whoever ditches us..

1404
01:04:53,125 --> 01:04:55,541
She is here because she trusted me. 
So..

1405
01:04:56,083 --> 01:04:56,208
I can't leave her.

1406
01:04:56,208 --> 01:04:57,291
I can't leave her.

1407
01:04:58,666 --> 01:05:01,083
It's okay brother. There 
will be some other way.

1408
01:05:02,375 --> 01:05:06,375
Lovelesh, I have no other option. That's 
why.. Or else I would have done it.

1409
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:16,833
You saw all the trophies he got 
from setting up all those marriages?

1410
01:05:16,916 --> 01:05:18,625
- Rahul. 
- Stop bluffing.

1411
01:05:18,750 --> 01:05:20,208
I'm telling the truth.

1412
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:20,458
Could have atleast considered 
him if we got some bombs.

1413
01:05:20,791 --> 01:05:22,708
Could have atleast considered 
him if we got some bombs.

1414
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:23,250
Why?

1415
01:05:23,541 --> 01:05:24,541
Who is that?

1416
01:05:24,583 --> 01:05:24,625
Rahul!

1417
01:05:24,833 --> 01:05:25,250
Rahul!

1418
01:05:25,333 --> 01:05:27,625
Get straight into the Ar. 
Must be Mufti police.

1419
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:28,958
Walk.

1420
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:29,958
Mufti, escape.

1421
01:05:30,583 --> 01:05:31,666
How do you know that?

1422
01:05:31,708 --> 01:05:33,666
Didn't you see the socks 
and boots he's wearing.

1423
01:05:33,666 --> 01:05:34,291
How?

1424
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:35,791
I still don't get it.

1425
01:05:35,791 --> 01:05:37,250
Socks and boots man.

1426
01:05:37,291 --> 01:05:38,125
Socks?

1427
01:05:38,166 --> 01:05:40,416
S.K. stop overacting 
and get in the car.

1428
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:45,041
He's right behind us.

1429
01:05:45,083 --> 01:05:46,083
It's definitely Mufti.

1430
01:05:46,125 --> 01:05:47,458
Jinto, do something.

1431
01:05:48,125 --> 01:05:49,125
Take a right.

1432
01:05:49,833 --> 01:05:50,833
Jinto!

1433
01:05:53,958 --> 01:05:56,958
Just narrowly escaped from that 
that officer's rings edge.

1434
01:05:57,625 --> 01:05:58,458
Ring?

1435
01:05:58,666 --> 01:05:59,500
What ring?

1436
01:05:59,625 --> 01:06:00,625
Great!

1437
01:06:00,875 --> 01:06:00,916
I actually thought you 
all knew about him.

1438
01:06:00,916 --> 01:06:03,708
I actually thought you 
all knew about him.

1439
01:06:03,708 --> 01:06:06,500
We have just heard that he is ruthless. 
We know nothing more.

1440
01:06:06,541 --> 01:06:08,791
Don't feel anything about me 
telling them about your uncle.

1441
01:06:09,541 --> 01:06:11,875
Do you know how he 
got that nickname?

1442
01:06:11,875 --> 01:06:15,000
A big gangster named Pulimala Sugunan who 
everyone in Kattapana was afraid off.

1443
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:22,625
A great fight between two 
Tamilians in the market.

1444
01:06:36,125 --> 01:06:38,125
That's when her uncle..

1445
01:06:38,166 --> 01:06:41,458
Walks in smoking 
cigarette in slow-motion.

1446
01:07:17,083 --> 01:07:20,166
What I don't understand, What did 
we do Togo through all this?

1447
01:07:20,208 --> 01:07:23,541
In Bangalore, the police won't 
interfere with our personal matters.

1448
01:07:23,708 --> 01:07:25,791
But we are not in Bangalore. 
We are here right?

1449
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:25,833
Jinto, just stop the car.

1450
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:27,416
Jinto, just stop the car.

1451
01:07:27,583 --> 01:07:28,583
I'm getting down here.

1452
01:07:28,625 --> 01:07:30,875
All this for no reason.

1453
01:07:30,875 --> 01:07:32,291
I'm stopping all 
this social service.

1454
01:07:32,333 --> 01:07:34,416
Don't say that. How can 
we do this without you?

1455
01:07:34,458 --> 01:07:35,458
Get lost man.

1456
01:07:35,875 --> 01:07:37,916
It's their need and 
we get into trouble.

1457
01:07:38,166 --> 01:07:40,041
Not only that, I can't 
stand her attitude

1458
01:07:40,041 --> 01:07:41,750
- We had told you not to come if you are scared. 
- Hey, Anju!

1459
01:07:41,791 --> 01:07:43,416
Who are you to decide whether 
I should come or not.

1460
01:07:43,458 --> 01:07:45,250
This has been on for some 
time, Jinto stop the car.

1461
01:07:45,250 --> 01:07:46,708
Don't make a fuzz.

1462
01:07:46,708 --> 01:07:47,541
Jinto stop the car.

1463
01:07:47,541 --> 01:07:48,916
You won't even get an auto here.

1464
01:07:48,916 --> 01:07:50,125
I'll manage.

1465
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:54,291
It's my mom. She's calling to 
see if I'll be home for dinner.

1466
01:07:54,458 --> 01:07:55,166
You stop the car.

1467
01:07:55,208 --> 01:07:56,416
Rahul. Rahulettan.

1468
01:07:58,541 --> 01:07:59,541
Rahul listen.

1469
01:07:59,583 --> 01:08:00,791
Rahulettan please.

1470
01:08:01,375 --> 01:08:03,000
I'm not coming, 
I'll reach somehow

1471
01:08:03,041 --> 01:08:04,333
I'll walk all the way home.

1472
01:08:04,375 --> 01:08:06,916
My mothers love will get me there. 
You leave.

1473
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:07,666
Rahul!

1474
01:08:07,666 --> 01:08:08,333
Get lost.

1475
01:08:11,208 --> 01:08:13,125
- Hello, mom. 
- Where are you?

1476
01:08:13,125 --> 01:08:14,375
- I'm on my way. 
- Where did you reach?

1477
01:08:14,416 --> 01:08:16,541
I haven't eaten anything. 
Save some food for me.

1478
01:08:17,458 --> 01:08:19,833
Good for nothing. 
You get here first.

1479
01:08:19,833 --> 01:08:19,875
Papa is waiting for you.

1480
01:08:19,875 --> 01:08:21,125
Papa is waiting for you.

1481
01:08:21,125 --> 01:08:22,250
To hand you over to the police.

1482
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:24,500
With which girl did you elope?

1483
01:08:24,541 --> 01:08:26,625
Police has caught 
your friend Ittup.

1484
01:08:26,666 --> 01:08:29,166
I had already told you 
not to mingle with them.

1485
01:08:29,208 --> 01:08:31,333
The police was here 
searching for you.

1486
01:08:31,375 --> 01:08:32,958
Did you think about the family?

1487
01:08:32,958 --> 01:08:34,291
Did you think about us?

1488
01:08:34,291 --> 01:08:35,250
You just get here.

1489
01:08:45,708 --> 01:08:47,083
Just move over.

1490
01:08:47,541 --> 01:08:48,875
What happened? Isn't 
dinner ready?

1491
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:51,000
Don't make me say anything.

1492
01:08:51,041 --> 01:08:53,250
I hope you are happy that 
you ruined everything.

1493
01:08:53,416 --> 01:08:54,833
Police caught Ittupettan.

1494
01:08:55,625 --> 01:08:57,208
Police has been to my house.

1495
01:08:57,291 --> 01:08:59,250
They are saying that I 
kidnapped some girl.

1496
01:09:00,625 --> 01:09:04,125
If I go anywhere near my house, my 
father will hand me over to the police.

1497
01:09:05,041 --> 01:09:06,666
Is your fathers 
name Chacko Maashu?

1498
01:09:06,708 --> 01:09:07,708
Lovlesh you!

1499
01:09:08,083 --> 01:09:11,166
Don't use your rotten 
comedies in such a situation.

1500
01:09:12,708 --> 01:09:13,708
Rahulettan.

1501
01:09:15,208 --> 01:09:16,875
If it's this big a problem.

1502
01:09:16,916 --> 01:09:17,916
I'll surrender.

1503
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:19,666
Now what's the use of all that.

1504
01:09:19,750 --> 01:09:21,125
Getting beaten up 
is almost certain.

1505
01:09:21,166 --> 01:09:22,166
Move aside.

1506
01:09:24,416 --> 01:09:29,000
Dear Jinto, Before we run into her 
uncle, Take this car somewhere

1507
01:09:29,083 --> 01:09:29,125
Start the car.

1508
01:09:29,125 --> 01:09:30,083
Start the car.

1509
01:09:40,541 --> 01:09:43,500
Sir, he had given 
Angel a rose before.

1510
01:09:45,250 --> 01:09:46,833
What is that mark on your face.

1511
01:09:46,833 --> 01:09:48,208
Did the rose's thorn cut you?

1512
01:09:48,208 --> 01:09:50,583
- Sir, when someone swung a knife. 
- Quotation?

1513
01:09:50,625 --> 01:09:53,375
No, dad swung it when he was 
off to cut down a tree.

1514
01:09:55,375 --> 01:09:56,166
Sir.

1515
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:59,000
He gave her a love letter 
when she was in 8th.

1516
01:10:00,625 --> 01:10:01,625
Did you get a reply.

1517
01:10:01,875 --> 01:10:02,875
No.

1518
01:10:03,916 --> 01:10:04,916
What is this, one 
shirt over another.

1519
01:10:04,958 --> 01:10:05,958
I'm a driver sir.

1520
01:10:06,791 --> 01:10:07,791
Driver?

1521
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Sir, he..

1522
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:21,541
Just thinking about all these proposals to a 
girl in our house. It does feel quiet great.

1523
01:10:27,208 --> 01:10:29,041
I was the one who 
caught him sir.

1524
01:10:29,666 --> 01:10:31,125
He proposed to Angel too?

1525
01:10:31,166 --> 01:10:33,750
No, we haven't caught 
him for loving.

1526
01:10:34,250 --> 01:10:38,041
There is a rental house next to 
our girl's house at Thrissur.

1527
01:10:38,166 --> 01:10:39,625
He is the house owner.

1528
01:10:40,750 --> 01:10:43,958
In his house there are are 
always two guys there.

1529
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,166
According to the servant one 
of the kidnappers were short.

1530
01:10:47,458 --> 01:10:49,958
One of the guys at his 
house is also short.

1531
01:10:51,791 --> 01:10:52,250
Me?

1532
01:10:53,083 --> 01:10:54,083
Come here.

1533
01:10:59,125 --> 01:11:00,125
Where are they?

1534
01:11:01,291 --> 01:11:02,291
Where are they?

1535
01:11:03,125 --> 01:11:04,875
They have gone for a tour.

1536
01:11:05,416 --> 01:11:06,416
What tour?

1537
01:11:06,958 --> 01:11:07,000
Company tour.

1538
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:07,958
Company tour.

1539
01:11:10,416 --> 01:11:11,416
Which company?

1540
01:11:11,833 --> 01:11:12,958
Not from his job?

1541
01:11:13,416 --> 01:11:13,458
It's when we all get together..

1542
01:11:13,458 --> 01:11:15,458
It's when we all get together..

1543
01:11:16,875 --> 01:11:17,875
Company.

1544
01:11:55,958 --> 01:11:56,000
- Where are you going to? 
- What is it?

1545
01:11:56,250 --> 01:11:58,125
- Where are you going to? 
- What is it?

1546
01:11:58,166 --> 01:11:59,541
This road leads to the 
front of my house.

1547
01:12:00,708 --> 01:12:02,791
If you don't know, the 
don't show him the way.

1548
01:12:03,125 --> 01:12:04,500
What are you doing Lovelesh?

1549
01:12:04,541 --> 01:12:06,666
I told you not to bring 
such fools into this.

1550
01:12:06,791 --> 01:12:08,583
Stop hitting. The 
phone is ringing.

1551
01:12:08,625 --> 01:12:09,500
It's Sureshettan.

1552
01:12:09,625 --> 01:12:09,666
Hello Sureshetta,

1553
01:12:09,666 --> 01:12:10,541
Hello Sureshetta,

1554
01:12:10,583 --> 01:12:11,583
I'll talk.

1555
01:12:11,583 --> 01:12:13,333
Sureshetta, It's a 
complete mess here.

1556
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:18,041
This idiot made us round back to the front 
of her house. We have no idea what to do.

1557
01:12:19,583 --> 01:12:20,583
Do one thing.

1558
01:12:21,125 --> 01:12:22,416
Go further down that road.

1559
01:12:23,291 --> 01:12:26,750
The only place there won't 
be any police will there.

1560
01:12:26,750 --> 01:12:28,833
We have no idea what to do.

1561
01:12:29,125 --> 01:12:29,166
You drive straight 
down that road.

1562
01:12:29,166 --> 01:12:31,041
You drive straight 
down that road.

1563
01:12:31,083 --> 01:12:33,875
No problem. I'm close by.

1564
01:12:34,166 --> 01:12:34,791
Okay?

1565
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:36,541
Which car are you driving?

1566
01:12:36,541 --> 01:12:38,291
A white color Omni, MGR BOSS.

1567
01:12:38,333 --> 01:12:39,333
Okay.

1568
01:12:58,583 --> 01:13:00,166
How long will you stand here?

1569
01:13:00,416 --> 01:13:01,416
She'll come.

1570
01:13:01,916 --> 01:13:03,250
Come, let's go inside.

1571
01:13:07,833 --> 01:13:08,833
Let her come.

1572
01:13:09,583 --> 01:13:09,625
Then I'll come inside.

1573
01:13:09,625 --> 01:13:11,041
Then I'll come inside.

1574
01:13:15,458 --> 01:13:16,458
Stop here.

1575
01:13:24,875 --> 01:13:25,875
I'm opening it.

1576
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Get down.

1577
01:13:29,708 --> 01:13:32,291
You are here to save us at 
the right time. Thanks.

1578
01:13:32,708 --> 01:13:34,333
I don't know if I 
can save you guys.

1579
01:13:34,875 --> 01:13:37,583
Police came to my home, 
the second you left.

1580
01:13:37,875 --> 01:13:40,666
They might have been there 
on because of my past.

1581
01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:42,333
We saw a guy in Mufti.

1582
01:13:42,791 --> 01:13:42,833
Near your house.

1583
01:13:42,833 --> 01:13:43,750
Near your house.

1584
01:13:43,833 --> 01:13:45,708
Then they will be 
right behind us.

1585
01:13:45,708 --> 01:13:49,875
Sureshetta, we have been driving 
around with no idea off what to do.

1586
01:13:50,208 --> 01:13:53,416
If you could tell us some solution. 
It would be of great help.

1587
01:13:53,458 --> 01:13:54,458
There’s a way.

1588
01:13:54,916 --> 01:13:55,916
Your town is Thrissur right?

1589
01:13:56,333 --> 01:13:57,458
There is a temple at Thrissur

1590
01:13:57,541 --> 01:13:59,458
They start conducting marriages 
from 6 in the morning.

1591
01:13:59,583 --> 01:14:01,416
Just that one of you 
has to be a Hindu.

1592
01:14:01,791 --> 01:14:03,500
If the groom is Hindu then 
there will be no issues.

1593
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:05,708
I know someone from the 
panchayat near by.

1594
01:14:05,791 --> 01:14:05,833
We can get there and do the 
registration before 9am.

1595
01:14:05,833 --> 01:14:07,916
We can get there and do the 
registration before 9am.

1596
01:14:08,375 --> 01:14:11,666
But all we get is a temporary certificate 
but it has a 6 month validity.

1597
01:14:11,666 --> 01:14:13,625
We can get this marriage 
done in between that.

1598
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:15,416
- Isn't that enough. 
- Thanks chetta.

1599
01:14:15,458 --> 01:14:16,458
A big favor.

1600
01:14:18,083 --> 01:14:20,416
If all this has to happen. You 
have to get to Thrissur.

1601
01:14:20,750 --> 01:14:24,125
This town is surrounded by police. 
It's not easy to pass them

1602
01:14:25,416 --> 01:14:26,833
There's only one way.

1603
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:29,583
You must hide somewhere 
for 2 hours.

1604
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:34,208
When they can't get any new information 
on you. They might think you got away.

1605
01:14:34,250 --> 01:14:36,000
You can go to Thrissur 
in that time.

1606
01:14:36,916 --> 01:14:40,375
We'll take care of that. 
Whatever you did for us.

1607
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:41,416
Is superb.

1608
01:14:41,458 --> 01:14:42,958
We'll take care of the rest.

1609
01:14:43,125 --> 01:14:44,375
We'll find a place.

1610
01:14:44,875 --> 01:14:47,416
Then you call me when 
everything’s set.

1611
01:14:52,125 --> 01:14:55,291
We have to find some safe 
place like Sureshettan said.

1612
01:14:55,458 --> 01:14:56,416
Let's do one thing.

1613
01:14:56,666 --> 01:14:58,791
If there is any lodge near by...

1614
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,666
We can stay there for the night.

1615
01:15:00,833 --> 01:15:02,625
We can leave in the morning.

1616
01:15:02,750 --> 01:15:03,583
That will be safe

1617
01:15:03,583 --> 01:15:05,000
I won't come to any lodge.

1618
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,375
You have no issue if 
we get locked up.

1619
01:15:07,708 --> 01:15:09,041
She can't stay in a lodge.

1620
01:15:09,541 --> 01:15:09,583
Are these your friends?

1621
01:15:09,583 --> 01:15:10,875
Are these your friends?

1622
01:15:11,541 --> 01:15:12,625
Great.

1623
01:15:14,083 --> 01:15:17,083
I have a friend. Her name is Honey. 
Let's go to her house.

1624
01:15:17,083 --> 01:15:18,208
She will help me.

1625
01:15:19,208 --> 01:15:21,083
jinto, take a right 
from this junction.

1626
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:23,333
We can go to Honey's house.

1627
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:24,291
Make it fast.

1628
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:30,833
Jinto take a right 
like she said.

1629
01:15:31,125 --> 01:15:31,791
Honey then,

1630
01:15:31,791 --> 01:15:32,791
We can go now.

1631
01:15:33,458 --> 01:15:36,166
her house will be safer 
than this or a lodge.

1632
01:15:36,208 --> 01:15:36,791
Yes.

1633
01:15:36,791 --> 01:15:38,291
Where did you say her house was?

1634
01:15:38,333 --> 01:15:40,916
That's okay. He know's 
he'll drive us there.

1635
01:15:41,666 --> 01:15:42,666
My hair is okay right?

1636
01:15:42,916 --> 01:15:43,541
Mine?

1637
01:15:43,541 --> 01:15:44,291
Not so much.

1638
01:15:44,458 --> 01:15:45,500
Then your's isn't 
that great either.

1639
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:46,458
Get lost, mine is superb.

1640
01:15:57,541 --> 01:15:58,541
Vinu come.

1641
01:15:58,541 --> 01:15:59,458
Don't create a problem.

1642
01:16:14,041 --> 01:16:15,416
I couldn't inform you.

1643
01:16:15,458 --> 01:16:18,166
But in the end I needed 
your help itself.

1644
01:16:19,791 --> 01:16:20,458
What?

1645
01:16:20,458 --> 01:16:21,250
Stay there.

1646
01:16:21,291 --> 01:16:23,333
- Go sit there - You come too.

1647
01:16:23,375 --> 01:16:23,875
Go.

1648
01:16:23,916 --> 01:16:27,000
- She wasn't talking about me. 
- She said everyone.

1649
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:36,958
Alex.

1650
01:16:58,583 --> 01:17:01,625
Is this tension on your face 
from seeing an unexpected host.

1651
01:17:04,208 --> 01:17:05,875
Are these the brave ones?

1652
01:17:07,208 --> 01:17:08,208
Us?

1653
01:17:09,583 --> 01:17:12,666
None of them looks 
up to that range.

1654
01:17:14,291 --> 01:17:17,000
Or has your taste changed?

1655
01:17:19,375 --> 01:17:21,958
S.K. What if we slap him.

1656
01:17:22,583 --> 01:17:24,916
So how is it, shouldn't 
we end everything.

1657
01:17:25,541 --> 01:17:28,250
Should we tell your friends 
all the story or..

1658
01:17:32,125 --> 01:17:34,208
For God's sake. Leave him Alex.

1659
01:17:38,041 --> 01:17:40,375
I won't talk about 
the number of years

1660
01:17:40,375 --> 01:17:42,625
- But I always had you here. 
- Sorry.

1661
01:17:43,958 --> 01:17:44,666
Vinu come.

1662
01:17:45,083 --> 01:17:45,833
Let's go.

1663
01:17:46,833 --> 01:17:47,833
Come fast.

1664
01:17:48,083 --> 01:17:48,125
Shoes.

1665
01:17:48,125 --> 01:17:49,333
Shoes.

1666
01:17:49,375 --> 01:17:51,750
Come fast, we don't 
need the shoes and all.

1667
01:17:51,791 --> 01:17:52,750
Run fast.

1668
01:17:56,375 --> 01:17:58,583
Vinu, get inside fast.

1669
01:18:01,666 --> 01:18:01,708
S.K. save me.

1670
01:18:01,708 --> 01:18:02,666
S.K. save me.

1671
01:18:07,291 --> 01:18:08,291
Get in.

1672
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,666
Start the car.

1673
01:18:46,333 --> 01:18:48,208
Is this the safe place 
you were talking about?

1674
01:18:48,208 --> 01:18:50,750
Isn't that the Alex who 
studied in Nirmala?

1675
01:18:53,875 --> 01:18:55,000
Who is he to you?

1676
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:55,541
Why did he confront us?

1677
01:18:55,541 --> 01:18:57,166
Why did he confront us?

1678
01:18:58,250 --> 01:18:59,250
Speak!

1679
01:19:00,708 --> 01:19:02,333
If it's personal, 
then no need to say.

1680
01:19:02,375 --> 01:19:05,166
What personal matter? We are here 
because of her personnel matter.

1681
01:19:05,583 --> 01:19:07,083
This is all happening 
because of her.

1682
01:19:07,625 --> 01:19:08,625
What personal matter?

1683
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Let her speak.

1684
01:19:10,166 --> 01:19:10,208
First you say who 
Alex is to you..

1685
01:19:10,208 --> 01:19:11,541
First you say who 
Alex is to you..

1686
01:19:11,541 --> 01:19:12,541
Or let him say.

1687
01:19:12,916 --> 01:19:14,375
He is the one marrying her.

1688
01:19:14,708 --> 01:19:15,708
Say!

1689
01:19:17,708 --> 01:19:19,166
Alex was my boyfriend.

1690
01:19:27,208 --> 01:19:30,666
To escape from the marriage 
fixed with him. That's why I...

1691
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:32,583
Here.

1692
01:19:35,416 --> 01:19:38,333
Vinu, come outside. I 
have something to say.

1693
01:19:51,375 --> 01:19:52,958
What are you planning to do?

1694
01:19:53,166 --> 01:19:56,250
Are you going to marry someone 
who is fixed for someone else.

1695
01:19:56,291 --> 01:19:58,291
Vinu, let me be open with you.

1696
01:19:58,333 --> 01:20:00,875
I was with you till this moment. 
But i won't be tricked.

1697
01:20:00,916 --> 01:20:03,541
To get rid of someone shouldn't 
be the reason to marry you.

1698
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:04,583
Tell her to go.

1699
01:20:04,750 --> 01:20:06,500
We'll drop her home 
and say good bye.

1700
01:20:06,708 --> 01:20:09,666
Just because her uncle is in 
police, shouldn't we all live?

1701
01:20:25,208 --> 01:20:27,583
It's me who should 
say sorry to you.

1702
01:20:28,958 --> 01:20:31,291
She had already 
told me everything.

1703
01:20:32,166 --> 01:20:34,666
I never took it seriously

1704
01:20:37,333 --> 01:20:40,250
She must have done this because 
she wasn't interested.

1705
01:20:46,458 --> 01:20:48,208
But please don't leave me.

1706
01:20:48,416 --> 01:20:49,041
S.K.

1707
01:20:49,291 --> 01:20:50,625
I have no other way.

1708
01:20:51,833 --> 01:20:53,541
Leave? We didn't say 
it in that sense.

1709
01:20:53,541 --> 01:20:54,583
Try to understand.

1710
01:20:54,583 --> 01:20:55,666
Like Rahul said.

1711
01:20:57,250 --> 01:20:58,333
Rest in a lodge.

1712
01:20:59,250 --> 01:21:02,416
Without taking any risk 
we can go to Sureshettan

1713
01:21:02,708 --> 01:21:02,750
I'm ready for anything.

1714
01:21:02,750 --> 01:21:04,250
I'm ready for anything.

1715
01:21:04,583 --> 01:21:05,583
But you guys.

1716
01:21:06,666 --> 01:21:08,083
Shouldn't retreat 
from this idea.

1717
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:09,750
It's not that Vinu.

1718
01:21:09,791 --> 01:21:12,166
She has another love and all.

1719
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:14,083
After knowing that, why?

1720
01:21:17,208 --> 01:21:20,083
We have all loved and 
lost right Rahul?

1721
01:21:21,041 --> 01:21:21,666
I know.

1722
01:21:21,708 --> 01:21:24,500
You guys are talking 
a huge risk for me.

1723
01:21:26,583 --> 01:21:27,958
But whatever happens.

1724
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:30,958
Whatever happens. 
I'll take the risk.

1725
01:21:37,541 --> 01:21:38,416
Still..

1726
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:38,541
Why are we even living if we 
can't help such a nice person.

1727
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:44,291
Why are we even living if we 
can't help such a nice person.

1728
01:21:45,666 --> 01:21:48,500
Like S.K. said police 
will catch us anyway.

1729
01:21:49,166 --> 01:21:50,166
So then

1730
01:21:50,166 --> 01:21:52,208
Let it be after their marriage.

1731
01:22:20,416 --> 01:22:22,541
Now going any further is a risk.

1732
01:22:23,541 --> 01:22:25,125
Take the car to a lodge.

1733
01:22:26,125 --> 01:22:26,166
- But Angeline.. 
- Then what are we supposed to do?

1734
01:22:26,375 --> 01:22:29,083
- But Angeline.. 
- Then what are we supposed to do?

1735
01:22:29,083 --> 01:22:30,916
Should we run right 
into the police?

1736
01:22:31,125 --> 01:22:32,458
- Should we? 
- No need

1737
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:35,125
take the car to a lodge.

1738
01:22:46,375 --> 01:22:47,375
Superb lodge.

1739
01:22:50,666 --> 01:22:52,041
S.K. superb.

1740
01:22:52,083 --> 01:22:52,875
Good setup.

1741
01:22:53,583 --> 01:22:55,875
Park the car in a way 
that no one notices.

1742
01:22:56,291 --> 01:22:56,333
There.

1743
01:22:56,333 --> 01:22:57,291
There.

1744
01:23:00,166 --> 01:23:02,208
We'll go and buy some food. 
From there.

1745
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:06,333
- Why? 
- Haven't had anything since morning.

1746
01:23:07,625 --> 01:23:08,583
Will you reach fast?

1747
01:23:08,666 --> 01:23:10,666
It's right next to this place.

1748
01:23:11,791 --> 01:23:14,000
If there's anything 
just contact Vinu.

1749
01:23:14,125 --> 01:23:15,250
Okay. Come Jinto.

1750
01:23:15,291 --> 01:23:17,916
- Love, where are you going to. 
- To this shop.

1751
01:23:18,583 --> 01:23:20,166
- Nearby right - 1km

1752
01:23:20,166 --> 01:23:21,333
Just shut up and come.

1753
01:23:21,333 --> 01:23:24,000
I'm hungry. Haven't eaten 
anything since morning.

1754
01:23:24,041 --> 01:23:25,041
Bro

1755
01:23:26,291 --> 01:23:26,750
Bro

1756
01:23:27,083 --> 01:23:28,083
Bro

1757
01:23:33,166 --> 01:23:34,333
Awesome, great sign.

1758
01:23:34,583 --> 01:23:37,541
The current is gone the 
second we stepped in

1759
01:23:37,833 --> 01:23:38,833
Bro!

1760
01:23:38,916 --> 01:23:39,625
Bro

1761
01:23:40,250 --> 01:23:41,250
Bro

1762
01:23:42,833 --> 01:23:44,375
This is a routine here.

1763
01:23:48,583 --> 01:23:50,625
Is there a room here. 
We need a room.

1764
01:23:50,666 --> 01:23:51,625
Room?

1765
01:23:51,958 --> 01:23:53,791
Did they go to buy something?

1766
01:23:54,291 --> 01:23:56,291
Medical shop is very far away.

1767
01:23:56,583 --> 01:23:58,083
Should have taken the car.

1768
01:23:58,375 --> 01:23:59,458
What?

1769
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,833
Just give us a room. 
Don't talk too much.

1770
01:24:01,833 --> 01:24:04,291
Including them 5, right?

1771
01:24:04,666 --> 01:24:09,166
Do you need 5 rooms 
or 2 rooms is enough?

1772
01:24:09,416 --> 01:24:10,375
2 rooms is enough.

1773
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:10,541
2 rooms is enough right. 
Okay then.

1774
01:24:10,541 --> 01:24:12,916
2 rooms is enough right. 
Okay then.

1775
01:24:15,166 --> 01:24:16,166
Give it.

1776
01:24:17,458 --> 01:24:18,125
Room

1777
01:24:18,458 --> 01:24:19,125
up

1778
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,750
we'll find it.

1779
01:24:22,916 --> 01:24:25,416
The room is above.

1780
01:24:27,583 --> 01:24:29,916
- Which is the room? 
- Let me check

1781
01:24:29,916 --> 01:24:31,541
- Which room? 
-I'm checking.

1782
01:24:31,583 --> 01:24:33,500
Just say, we'll 
also look for it.

1783
01:24:36,666 --> 01:24:37,333
This one?

1784
01:24:38,166 --> 01:24:40,500
We'll take this. 
Let them take that

1785
01:25:03,291 --> 01:25:04,666
What is your problem?

1786
01:25:08,375 --> 01:25:09,750
Can't you speak?

1787
01:25:10,125 --> 01:25:11,750
Don't irritate me Angel.

1788
01:25:12,208 --> 01:25:14,208
I've been bearing all 
this for sometime.

1789
01:25:21,416 --> 01:25:22,416
Hello!

1790
01:25:22,583 --> 01:25:23,125
Hello!

1791
01:25:23,333 --> 01:25:23,375
- Is S.K. there. 
- He isn't, tell

1792
01:25:23,583 --> 01:25:25,291
- Is S.K. there. 
- He isn't, tell

1793
01:25:25,375 --> 01:25:26,958
There is only porotta here.

1794
01:25:27,041 --> 01:25:29,875
Then with that either 
beef gravy or sambar.

1795
01:25:30,083 --> 01:25:31,416
You eat beef?

1796
01:25:31,416 --> 01:25:32,833
Buy whatever you want.

1797
01:25:35,333 --> 01:25:37,958
I know all this anger 
is targeted towards me.

1798
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:38,041
I also know the reason.

1799
01:25:38,250 --> 01:25:39,750
I also know the reason.

1800
01:25:41,208 --> 01:25:43,916
I have hid many things from you. 
I agree.

1801
01:25:44,166 --> 01:25:46,583
But I never intended 
to cheat you.

1802
01:25:46,791 --> 01:25:49,250
Those are things I don't 
want to remember.

1803
01:25:52,041 --> 01:25:54,041
Whatever happened in your life.

1804
01:25:55,208 --> 01:25:57,541
Did I ask you to tell 
me everything openly?

1805
01:25:59,125 --> 01:26:01,416
Have we ever told that 
we love each other?

1806
01:26:02,375 --> 01:26:03,375
No right?

1807
01:26:04,375 --> 01:26:06,541
you called me up one day.

1808
01:26:06,541 --> 01:26:08,916
Told me to come at 11am the 
next day and marry you.

1809
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:10,791
I never said a word.

1810
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,541
I haven't even told my parents.

1811
01:26:15,625 --> 01:26:18,125
I came along with 
you like a fool.

1812
01:26:18,958 --> 01:26:22,833
To a person like that. What would have 
changed if you had told this truth?

1813
01:26:23,625 --> 01:26:25,833
I give too much 
value for a word.

1814
01:26:26,583 --> 01:26:27,583
The word trust.

1815
01:26:28,416 --> 01:26:30,958
You might have no 
value for that word.

1816
01:26:41,875 --> 01:26:44,333
There is police around us.

1817
01:26:44,375 --> 01:26:46,291
- What? 
- A car has come that way.

1818
01:26:46,333 --> 01:26:47,208
Police?

1819
01:26:47,291 --> 01:26:48,500
Escape from there as 
soon as possible.

1820
01:26:51,291 --> 01:26:51,333
- What is it vinu? 
- Police.

1821
01:26:51,333 --> 01:26:52,833
- What is it vinu? 
- Police.

1822
01:26:53,541 --> 01:26:54,833
- Police? 
- Where?

1823
01:26:55,375 --> 01:26:55,416
Lovelesh called. The 
police has reached here.

1824
01:26:55,416 --> 01:26:57,208
Lovelesh called. The 
police has reached here.

1825
01:26:57,625 --> 01:26:58,750
Let's go fast. No time.

1826
01:26:59,291 --> 01:27:00,625
The police!

1827
01:27:00,708 --> 01:27:01,708
Come.

1828
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:03,250
Come fast.

1829
01:27:06,333 --> 01:27:07,333
What will we do?

1830
01:27:08,166 --> 01:27:08,208
What will we do?

1831
01:27:08,208 --> 01:27:09,708
What will we do?

1832
01:27:16,083 --> 01:27:18,333
Sir, you leave. 
I'll deal with it.

1833
01:27:28,625 --> 01:27:31,000
There's no way here. We will have 
to jump down. What do we do?

1834
01:27:38,666 --> 01:27:40,500
S.k. go down.

1835
01:27:51,583 --> 01:27:52,583
S.K. get back.

1836
01:28:25,666 --> 01:28:27,208
Come.

1837
01:28:42,541 --> 01:28:44,291
you take the car.

1838
01:28:48,958 --> 01:28:49,958
Angeline.

1839
01:29:06,958 --> 01:29:09,041
Come. Get in.

1840
01:29:10,791 --> 01:29:10,833
Start the car., fast.

1841
01:29:10,833 --> 01:29:12,208
Start the car., fast.

1842
01:29:35,041 --> 01:29:37,416
Drive fast.

1843
01:29:37,458 --> 01:29:38,875
He's right behind us.

1844
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:31,875
It's okay, they're gone. Keep driving.

1845
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:32,875
Oh no!

1846
01:30:32,875 --> 01:30:34,375
I can't find my glasses?

1847
01:30:42,250 --> 01:30:42,291
Who switched on this phone?

1848
01:30:42,291 --> 01:30:43,750
Who switched on this phone?

1849
01:30:43,791 --> 01:30:45,875
I had told you to 
off that phone.

1850
01:30:45,916 --> 01:30:45,958
I didn't know.

1851
01:30:45,958 --> 01:30:46,750
I didn't know.

1852
01:30:46,750 --> 01:30:48,291
Damn it!

1853
01:30:48,291 --> 01:30:51,291
Now check who is calling. 
Might be Lovelesh.

1854
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:53,000
Hello.

1855
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,750
Isn't it wrong to attend your 
phone while driving Rahul?

1856
01:30:55,791 --> 01:30:57,875
Did you call me up at this 
time to teach me the law?

1857
01:30:57,875 --> 01:30:58,875
Hang up!

1858
01:31:00,333 --> 01:31:03,375
You are standing in my circle 
and yet talking upto me?

1859
01:31:03,833 --> 01:31:04,708
Who are you?

1860
01:31:05,750 --> 01:31:05,791
My name is Joseph Dhayanidhi.

1861
01:31:05,791 --> 01:31:08,000
My name is Joseph Dhayanidhi.

1862
01:31:08,916 --> 01:31:11,750
The circle inspector 
to this area.

1863
01:31:13,625 --> 01:31:15,125
- Who is it? 
- Two-eyes.

1864
01:31:15,625 --> 01:31:16,541
Oh my god.

1865
01:31:18,125 --> 01:31:20,250
Put the phone in loud speaker.

1866
01:31:21,750 --> 01:31:22,416
Hello.

1867
01:31:22,666 --> 01:31:24,291
Is it clear who I am now?

1868
01:31:24,916 --> 01:31:25,375
Sir.

1869
01:31:26,291 --> 01:31:26,333
I know who's driving your car, 
how many of you are there.

1870
01:31:26,583 --> 01:31:29,375
I know who's driving your car, 
how many of you are there.

1871
01:31:29,375 --> 01:31:32,333
What's happening, I know it all.

1872
01:31:34,833 --> 01:31:36,208
I'll give you two options.

1873
01:31:37,083 --> 01:31:38,083
Option A.

1874
01:31:39,875 --> 01:31:39,916
If you can..

1875
01:31:39,916 --> 01:31:40,875
If you can..

1876
01:31:41,916 --> 01:31:46,125
If you can. Try crossing my circle.

1877
01:31:48,125 --> 01:31:49,125
Option B.

1878
01:31:49,833 --> 01:31:51,458
Park the car to the side.

1879
01:31:52,166 --> 01:31:55,416
Drop her there and keep going. 
I won't touch you.

1880
01:31:56,541 --> 01:31:59,708
I'll also leave all your 
friends who are in my custody.

1881
01:32:07,208 --> 01:32:09,583
Hey, don't get nervous.

1882
01:32:11,250 --> 01:32:14,625
If you drive fast and get into some 
accident. You have our girl in there.

1883
01:32:16,166 --> 01:32:18,875
I'm repeating. Listen 
to me carefully.

1884
01:32:20,375 --> 01:32:20,416
If you park the car on the 
side and drop her there.

1885
01:32:20,416 --> 01:32:24,125
If you park the car on the 
side and drop her there.

1886
01:32:24,541 --> 01:32:28,375
I won't touch any of you and 
I'll also leave your friends.

1887
01:32:31,375 --> 01:32:32,375
So..

1888
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:35,000
Is the girl important?

1889
01:32:35,375 --> 01:32:37,000
Or your friends?

1890
01:32:39,166 --> 01:32:40,750
You decide for yourself.

1891
01:32:41,791 --> 01:32:43,000
Hello.. Sir..

1892
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:51,041
Don't be afraid.

1893
01:32:51,041 --> 01:32:52,250
Don't be afraid.

1894
01:32:52,875 --> 01:32:52,916
We'll do whatever we can 
to cross this circle.

1895
01:32:52,916 --> 01:32:55,500
We'll do whatever we can 
to cross this circle.

1896
01:32:55,750 --> 01:32:56,500
For sure.

1897
01:32:56,875 --> 01:32:56,916
There is no issue. They are just 
threatening us. You don't be afraid.

1898
01:32:56,916 --> 01:33:00,791
There is no issue. They are just 
threatening us. You don't be afraid.

1899
01:33:01,791 --> 01:33:02,791
Threat?

1900
01:33:04,416 --> 01:33:08,375
Don't play a drama to calm me down. 
I'm not a fool.

1901
01:33:09,375 --> 01:33:12,291
I know what Ittupettan's and 
the others situation will be.

1902
01:33:12,625 --> 01:33:14,625
When they are trapped 
among inhumane people.

1903
01:33:14,625 --> 01:33:15,375
Stop the car.

1904
01:33:15,416 --> 01:33:17,625
Why stop the car. 
There is no problem.

1905
01:33:17,666 --> 01:33:19,666
I told you to stop the car.

1906
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:20,500
Stop the car.

1907
01:33:21,666 --> 01:33:23,541
I'll stop. I'll stop.

1908
01:33:27,583 --> 01:33:29,875
Are you all martyrs or something?

1909
01:33:32,333 --> 01:33:34,958
You guys leave. First 
save your friends.

1910
01:33:36,750 --> 01:33:37,958
Not just that.

1911
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:41,083
What I came expecting. I have 
realized that I have lost it.

1912
01:33:54,125 --> 01:33:54,500
Vinu.

1913
01:33:55,083 --> 01:33:57,041
- Vinu. 
- She's leaving. Go call her.

1914
01:33:58,291 --> 01:33:59,333
Vinu just go!

1915
01:34:00,375 --> 01:34:02,750
What are you thinking about? 
Go and call her.

1916
01:34:03,708 --> 01:34:04,958
Vinu she's leaving.

1917
01:34:36,333 --> 01:34:37,333
What happened?

1918
01:34:37,333 --> 01:34:38,458
It's all over.

1919
01:34:38,500 --> 01:34:40,208
That C.I. took Lovlesh and Jinto.

1920
01:34:40,208 --> 01:34:40,958
She's gone too.

1921
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,333
What do we do now?

1922
01:34:51,208 --> 01:34:53,875
Whatever happened. You 
shouldn't have let her go.

1923
01:34:58,833 --> 01:35:00,208
What else can we do?

1924
01:35:01,208 --> 01:35:05,083
We might have to give up 
something to gain something else.

1925
01:35:07,250 --> 01:35:09,875
That's when certain looks 
come across our faces.

1926
01:35:12,166 --> 01:35:15,250
Looks of small expectations.

1927
01:35:18,041 --> 01:35:18,083
I have stood in that situation.

1928
01:35:18,083 --> 01:35:20,000
I have stood in that situation.

1929
01:35:20,916 --> 01:35:21,916
But then..

1930
01:35:22,583 --> 01:35:24,083
No one was there with me.

1931
01:35:24,125 --> 01:35:25,375
I couldn't do anything.

1932
01:35:27,958 --> 01:35:30,708
It's not because you guys came 
to my house or told stories.

1933
01:35:30,750 --> 01:35:32,458
Or because of your dialogues.

1934
01:35:33,916 --> 01:35:36,375
Before she left. 
She glanced at me.

1935
01:35:41,375 --> 01:35:42,791
The same glance I 
have seen long back.

1936
01:35:46,625 --> 01:35:48,291
That's when I saw in her eyes.

1937
01:35:48,416 --> 01:35:48,458
The pain of someone who 
never wanted to go back.

1938
01:35:48,458 --> 01:35:51,625
The pain of someone who 
never wanted to go back.

1939
01:35:53,125 --> 01:35:54,375
That's why I came.

1940
01:35:58,583 --> 01:36:00,833
Let it go. If there 
is something call me.

1941
01:36:00,875 --> 01:36:01,458
Okay.

1942
01:36:10,625 --> 01:36:12,541
Okay. Then bring her back.

1943
01:36:18,291 --> 01:36:18,333
They must have got her right?

1944
01:36:18,333 --> 01:36:19,875
They must have got her right?

1945
01:36:22,541 --> 01:36:23,541
So you won.

1946
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,041
And my daughter as always lost.

1947
01:36:35,375 --> 01:36:36,375
Come.

1948
01:36:51,291 --> 01:36:52,125
What happened?

1949
01:36:52,125 --> 01:36:53,375
The car isn't starting.

1950
01:37:00,750 --> 01:37:04,666
Two hearts separate.

1951
01:37:04,958 --> 01:37:06,791
They part away

1952
01:37:07,250 --> 01:37:09,458
Alone.

1953
01:37:10,250 --> 01:37:14,208
Two souls melt away in that.

1954
01:37:14,666 --> 01:37:16,291
It darkens.

1955
01:37:17,166 --> 01:37:19,708
It continues.

1956
01:37:20,333 --> 01:37:28,458
The heart breaks as we part ways.

1957
01:37:30,291 --> 01:37:32,291
Smile disappears

1958
01:37:32,333 --> 01:37:38,958
All those dreams destroyed

1959
01:37:39,291 --> 01:37:44,166
It spirals down 
itself, far away.

1960
01:37:44,333 --> 01:37:48,541
The morning fades away in the distance.

1961
01:37:48,708 --> 01:37:51,916
The heart trembles.

1962
01:37:51,916 --> 01:37:54,416
Every day is the same.

1963
01:37:54,458 --> 01:37:54,500
The dreams that burn away.

1964
01:37:54,833 --> 01:38:01,000
The dreams that burn away.

1965
01:38:20,125 --> 01:38:24,250
It was my childhood wish to keep 
staring at the oceans for a long time.

1966
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,125
Staring at the oceans?

1967
01:38:26,125 --> 01:38:27,375
Yes. Why?

1968
01:38:27,875 --> 01:38:29,041
What's your wish?

1969
01:38:29,750 --> 01:38:30,958
To get a nice job.

1970
01:38:31,458 --> 01:38:32,833
To build a big house.

1971
01:38:33,208 --> 01:38:34,208
That's all.

1972
01:38:35,875 --> 01:38:38,250
Isn't this what 80% 
people wish for?

1973
01:38:38,708 --> 01:38:40,708
Then is staring at the 
ocean such a big thing

1974
01:38:40,791 --> 01:38:41,916
It's for me.

1975
01:38:52,916 --> 01:38:53,958
What is it?

1976
01:38:54,583 --> 01:38:56,041
What happened to you?

1977
01:38:57,666 --> 01:38:59,958
What good has your love and care brought?

1978
01:39:04,291 --> 01:39:06,208
I have become a worthless person.

1979
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:28,041
I'm fed up in comparing the violence 
and non violence in everything I do.

1980
01:39:28,666 --> 01:39:31,083
I can't take any 
decision for myself.

1981
01:39:31,125 --> 01:39:33,958
When I do anything. 
Will it hurt my mother?

1982
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,541
Whether my father 
will like it or not.

1983
01:39:36,708 --> 01:39:36,750
I can't even take 
a decision now.

1984
01:39:36,750 --> 01:39:38,791
I can't even take 
a decision now.

1985
01:39:39,125 --> 01:39:40,125
I'm scared now.

1986
01:39:40,875 --> 01:39:42,375
I have become a coward.

1987
01:39:47,375 --> 01:39:49,208
Aunty, is Vinu here?

1988
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:53,458
Did you let Alex 
take her for us?

1989
01:39:53,458 --> 01:39:54,458
Come here.

1990
01:39:54,708 --> 01:39:56,208
That too to a fool like him.

1991
01:39:56,458 --> 01:39:58,583
You come, We'll face 
whatever happens.

1992
01:39:58,708 --> 01:40:00,500
- Come Vinu 
- Vinu!

1993
01:40:19,250 --> 01:40:24,583
Now you don't need to check 
violence and peace in everything.

1994
01:40:26,208 --> 01:40:28,666
Your grandfather. 
That is my father.

1995
01:40:30,291 --> 01:40:32,791
Wasn't a freedom 
fighter or Gandhian.

1996
01:40:37,041 --> 01:40:38,708
Thoothukudy Veera Lingam.

1997
01:40:43,291 --> 01:40:45,583
He was a great 
smuggler in Madurai.

1998
01:40:45,666 --> 01:40:47,208
The leader of the poor.

1999
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:52,375
The police murdered him 
when I was 4 years old.

2000
01:40:53,375 --> 01:40:54,750
We left Madurai then.

2001
01:40:55,458 --> 01:40:59,375
In your childhood when we used to 
see you hold sticks like a gun.

2002
01:40:59,375 --> 01:41:00,458
Then what will I do.

2003
01:41:01,416 --> 01:41:04,916
Many fathers in our country might 
be using Gandhiji in such way.

2004
01:41:06,166 --> 01:41:07,541
I had no other option.

2005
01:41:10,750 --> 01:41:12,333
So son, don't be afraid.

2006
01:41:12,833 --> 01:41:12,875
Some action is allowed.

2007
01:41:12,875 --> 01:41:14,333
Some action is allowed.

2008
01:41:14,958 --> 01:41:17,750
Where ever she is. 
Bring her back.

2009
01:41:36,041 --> 01:41:38,125
Sureshetta, we are coming back.

2010
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:38,541
To save Angel.

2011
01:41:38,541 --> 01:41:39,500
To save Angel.

2012
01:41:39,916 --> 01:41:43,083
Go ahead. I'll take 
care of the rest.

2013
01:42:24,833 --> 01:42:25,583
Let her go!

2014
01:42:29,125 --> 01:42:31,333
First dialogue, then fight.

2015
01:42:59,416 --> 01:43:00,416
Stop.

2016
01:43:01,583 --> 01:43:02,583
Stop.

2017
01:43:02,833 --> 01:43:02,875
Didn't you hear him. Stop.

2018
01:43:02,875 --> 01:43:04,666
Didn't you hear him. Stop.

2019
01:43:05,666 --> 01:43:06,958
Who touched my buddies?

2020
01:43:22,041 --> 01:43:23,041
Come.

2021
01:44:00,916 --> 01:44:01,958
Tony!

2022
01:44:02,416 --> 01:44:03,416
Get down.

2023
01:44:03,833 --> 01:44:03,875
Suresh, come with us.

2024
01:44:03,875 --> 01:44:05,208
Suresh, come with us.

2025
01:44:05,791 --> 01:44:05,833
Get in the jeep.

2026
01:44:05,833 --> 01:44:06,916
Get in the jeep.

2027
01:44:07,041 --> 01:44:07,458
Come.

2028
01:44:07,541 --> 01:44:08,291
Come.

2029
01:44:08,333 --> 01:44:10,333
Sir, I have nothing 
to do with this.

2030
01:44:10,666 --> 01:44:12,166
- We'll talk about that later 
- I swear.

2031
01:44:12,208 --> 01:44:13,208
Get down here.

2032
01:44:14,291 --> 01:44:14,791
Run!

2033
01:44:15,166 --> 01:44:16,291
In front of us...

2034
01:44:19,708 --> 01:44:20,291
To the station

2035
01:44:25,625 --> 01:44:26,458
Tony.

2036
01:44:26,583 --> 01:44:27,583
What did you do?

2037
01:44:27,833 --> 01:44:30,583
Was it some tablo competition. I 
just told you to come to her house.

2038
01:44:30,625 --> 01:44:34,000
And for that all that drama?

2039
01:44:34,333 --> 01:44:35,875
That too in front of the police.

2040
01:44:36,083 --> 01:44:37,000
That's because...

2041
01:44:37,083 --> 01:44:40,708
When I worked at her house. 
I followed her a lot.

2042
01:44:41,083 --> 01:44:42,333
That's why.

2043
01:44:43,125 --> 01:44:45,916
Are you happy after you lost 
whatever dignity you had?

2044
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:47,250
To shame gangsters.

2045
01:44:48,333 --> 01:44:49,958
Tony where are you sitting?

2046
01:44:50,916 --> 01:44:51,916
Oh no!

2047
01:44:54,916 --> 01:44:57,916
Haven't seen her yet. have you 
told the lawyer everything?

2048
01:44:57,958 --> 01:45:01,583
My close friend is a criminal lawyer at 
the supreme court. Should I call him?

2049
01:45:01,625 --> 01:45:03,458
Must be Maraar from Narasimham?

2050
01:45:04,083 --> 01:45:05,625
I'll be under that tree. 
I'm going.

2051
01:45:05,625 --> 01:45:06,583
Wait.

2052
01:45:06,625 --> 01:45:07,916
Don't leave me alone.

2053
01:45:08,458 --> 01:45:09,333
We can go together.

2054
01:45:11,125 --> 01:45:13,375
Crime No 218/17

2055
01:45:13,416 --> 01:45:14,750
Thrissur, Thalapilly Thaluk

2056
01:45:14,791 --> 01:45:16,375
S/O Gangadharan from 
Kaarakattil house.

2057
01:45:16,375 --> 01:45:18,000
Vinu Gangadharan and his team

2058
01:45:18,041 --> 01:45:22,750
attacked the house of Angeline. D/O 
Fracis, from Thotapillly house.

2059
01:45:23,916 --> 01:45:25,625
I heard about that case.

2060
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:37,000
What is this?

2061
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:42,958
One elopes from her house to avoid 
the marriage with the man she loves.

2062
01:45:43,458 --> 01:45:46,791
That too with someone she 
knows only for 23 days.

2063
01:45:47,625 --> 01:45:49,500
After abandoning her on the road.

2064
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:52,666
He tried to attack her house and 
kidnap her the next morning.

2065
01:45:53,333 --> 01:45:54,333
What is this?

2066
01:45:54,333 --> 01:45:55,583
Some Telugu movie?

2067
01:45:57,541 --> 01:45:59,958
They might have better 
believable stories.

2068
01:46:02,375 --> 01:46:04,000
Is she the mentioned girl?

2069
01:46:06,208 --> 01:46:08,458
Aren't you educated people?

2070
01:46:08,750 --> 01:46:12,416
Should you shame the people who 
took care of you all these years?

2071
01:46:16,291 --> 01:46:18,541
Can't you avoid 
doing such things?

2072
01:46:23,750 --> 01:46:25,916
Whatever happens she 
doesn't say a word.

2073
01:46:26,375 --> 01:46:26,416
Then when things get 
serious she runs away.

2074
01:46:26,416 --> 01:46:28,666
Then when things get 
serious she runs away.

2075
01:46:32,375 --> 01:46:34,375
The girls these days.

2076
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:36,000
Pitiful.

2077
01:46:41,250 --> 01:46:45,791
It was always pitiful for girls.

2078
01:46:50,750 --> 01:46:52,833
I have told you 100 times.

2079
01:46:53,750 --> 01:46:53,791
a disgrace to the family.

2080
01:46:53,791 --> 01:46:55,458
a disgrace to the family.

2081
01:46:55,833 --> 01:46:55,875
You are right. I 
have been silent.

2082
01:46:55,875 --> 01:46:58,083
You are right. I 
have been silent.

2083
01:46:59,083 --> 01:47:00,458
Even kept to myself.

2084
01:47:39,875 --> 01:47:41,333
But I did speak.

2085
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:43,416
Every way I can.

2086
01:47:43,458 --> 01:47:46,333
I have tried my maximum, 
I can't do this anymore.

2087
01:47:46,333 --> 01:47:48,833
I know why he's doing all this.

2088
01:47:48,958 --> 01:47:50,958
If its like this. I won't be 
there for this Christmas.

2089
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,208
Don't call me about this either.

2090
01:47:53,583 --> 01:47:55,458
My decisions might be wrong.

2091
01:47:56,416 --> 01:47:58,583
But the 23 days you mentioned.

2092
01:47:58,958 --> 01:48:00,916
There is a lot of meaning 
to my life in that.

2093
01:48:04,666 --> 01:48:04,708
With a heart filled with hatred.

2094
01:48:04,708 --> 01:48:06,166
With a heart filled with hatred.

2095
01:48:06,208 --> 01:48:09,708
And then brush it all off with a smile. I 
was fed up all that. Its around that time.

2096
01:48:10,083 --> 01:48:11,083
I met Vinu.

2097
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,708
A good friend I lost long back

2098
01:48:41,250 --> 01:48:43,625
And some great day 
where I felt alive.

2099
01:48:43,958 --> 01:48:44,000
It was like I got it all back.

2100
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:45,833
It was like I got it all back.

2101
01:48:55,583 --> 01:49:00,291
I didn't say anything about 
me to Vinu, not to cheat him.

2102
01:49:01,208 --> 01:49:04,125
I never wanted him to change 
the way he looked at me.

2103
01:49:13,333 --> 01:49:14,333
But now I know.

2104
01:49:14,958 --> 01:49:17,083
Something that isn't 
true never lasts.

2105
01:49:22,208 --> 01:49:24,750
I won't trouble Vinu 
anymore with this.

2106
01:49:39,333 --> 01:49:41,958
Are you this Vinu?

2107
01:49:43,458 --> 01:49:47,416
To attack the girls house and try to 
kidnap her after leaving her on the road?

2108
01:49:47,458 --> 01:49:48,666
Aren't you ashamed?

2109
01:49:49,333 --> 01:49:49,958
No.

2110
01:49:50,125 --> 01:49:50,750
Huh?

2111
01:49:51,125 --> 01:49:51,875
You don't?

2112
01:49:53,333 --> 01:49:54,291
Sir.

2113
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:59,791
We just went through a fight. 
That's why all that happened.

2114
01:50:00,250 --> 01:50:01,250
Fight?

2115
01:50:02,250 --> 01:50:06,000
You didn't mention nursery when 
you said you were old friends.

2116
01:50:07,041 --> 01:50:07,083
Sir, not that.

2117
01:50:07,083 --> 01:50:08,041
Sir, not that.

2118
01:50:12,291 --> 01:50:14,750
Whatever you say. 
It is all my fault.

2119
01:50:15,708 --> 01:50:16,333
But.

2120
01:50:16,833 --> 01:50:20,375
But I don't wish to 
lose her for that.

2121
01:50:22,791 --> 01:50:26,458
Now my parents are 
interested in this relation.

2122
01:50:27,541 --> 01:50:27,583
Are you telling us 
some kind of riddle?

2123
01:50:27,583 --> 01:50:29,583
Are you telling us 
some kind of riddle?

2124
01:50:31,291 --> 01:50:31,916
Sir.

2125
01:50:32,416 --> 01:50:32,458
Sir, I love her very much.

2126
01:50:32,458 --> 01:50:34,166
Sir, I love her very much.

2127
01:50:35,916 --> 01:50:37,208
I want to marry her.

2128
01:50:37,916 --> 01:50:40,416
Sir, please help us get married.

2129
01:50:40,958 --> 01:50:41,958
Please, sir.

2130
01:50:55,458 --> 01:50:55,500
Then go marry and live 
happily thereafter.

2131
01:50:55,500 --> 01:50:58,791
Then go marry and live 
happily thereafter.

2132
01:51:04,875 --> 01:51:06,666
Does anyone have any objection?

2133
01:51:06,708 --> 01:51:08,083
If so, speak now.

2134
01:51:09,833 --> 01:51:10,833
No sir.

2135
01:51:20,208 --> 01:51:21,833
Thrissur, Thalapilly Thaluk

2136
01:51:21,833 --> 01:51:23,333
Thrissur, Thalapilly Thaluk

2137
01:51:23,750 --> 01:51:24,750
Kaarakatil House

2138
01:51:24,875 --> 01:51:25,791
Kaarakatil House

2139
01:51:25,875 --> 01:51:26,750
S/O of Gangadharan.

2140
01:51:26,875 --> 01:51:28,000
S/O of Gangadharan.

2141
01:51:28,250 --> 01:51:28,916
Vinu

2142
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:29,750
Vinu

2143
01:51:29,750 --> 01:51:30,500
Ernakulam

2144
01:51:30,541 --> 01:51:31,375
Ernakulam

2145
01:51:31,375 --> 01:51:36,750
S.K. you leave Allu Arjun 
and go for Venu Nagavally.

2146
01:51:38,375 --> 01:51:39,666
Will marry lawfully.

2147
01:51:39,750 --> 01:51:41,166
Will marry lawfully.

2148
01:51:42,750 --> 01:51:43,791
Even she is gone.

2149
01:51:51,125 --> 01:51:52,416
Give me a handshake.

2150
01:51:53,375 --> 01:51:54,541
- Congrats -Thank you.

2151
01:51:54,541 --> 01:51:57,416
And after everything 
was said and done.

2152
01:51:57,500 --> 01:51:58,500
Everyone was happy.

2153
01:51:58,500 --> 01:51:59,500
Smile please.

2154
01:52:02,416 --> 01:52:05,083
But at the same time 
in a different place.

2155
01:52:05,541 --> 01:52:07,916
There was a gangster 
named Pulimala Sugunan

2156
01:52:08,625 --> 01:52:11,708
I got my nick name 
because of him.

2157
01:52:13,833 --> 01:52:17,375
You both have the same face cut.

2158
01:52:17,583 --> 01:52:19,458
Only the scar is the difference.

2159
01:52:19,458 --> 01:52:24,000
Since the day, sister introduced 
you as the one to marry Angeline.

2160
01:52:25,625 --> 01:52:25,666
That Pulimala Sugunan keeps 
torturing me in my dreams.

2161
01:52:25,666 --> 01:52:28,708
That Pulimala Sugunan keeps 
torturing me in my dreams.

2162
01:52:28,750 --> 01:52:31,375
Uncle.

2163
01:52:33,416 --> 01:52:39,291
You are the one who had an affair 
while in love with Angeline.

2164
01:52:43,833 --> 01:52:46,833
You dare hit a girl 
from my family?

2165
01:52:50,333 --> 01:52:52,083
You know what my name is?

2166
01:52:58,125 --> 01:52:59,125
Dheyanidhi.

2167
01:53:00,708 --> 01:53:02,833
But for people like you.

2168
01:53:04,041 --> 01:53:06,166
Merciless.

2169
01:53:07,208 --> 01:53:08,208
Shall we start?

2170
01:53:20,375 --> 01:53:23,583
The Lovelesh that decided to do 
whatever he can for the society.

2171
01:53:24,083 --> 01:53:25,500
Bought a loading rickshaw.

2172
01:53:26,125 --> 01:53:28,208
He let Jinto tag along to help.

2173
01:53:29,708 --> 01:53:33,083
Like every father, even Vinu 
had a dream for his son.

2174
01:53:33,708 --> 01:53:39,750
So for him to play. He bought him guns, 
tanks and boxing gloves and all.

2175
01:53:40,250 --> 01:53:43,208
But junior Vinu had no 
interest in all that.

2176
01:53:49,791 --> 01:53:52,333
So like that S.K got 
back in the game.

2177
01:53:53,166 --> 01:53:53,208
S.k. who decided he will 
only marry out of love.

2178
01:53:53,208 --> 01:53:56,000
S.k. who decided he will 
only marry out of love.

2179
01:53:56,000 --> 01:54:00,875
Started roaming around every park, beach 
and mall he can find in his place.

2180
01:54:00,916 --> 01:54:01,875
Apsara.

2181
01:54:02,083 --> 01:54:03,583
What is she doing here?

2182
01:54:05,875 --> 01:54:05,916
Hi S.K.

2183
01:54:05,916 --> 01:54:07,083
Hi S.K.

2184
01:54:07,458 --> 01:54:08,708
What a surprise!

2185
01:54:09,416 --> 01:54:11,041
What are you doing here?

2186
01:54:11,083 --> 01:54:13,541
- What are you doing here. 
- Just here for some fresh air.

2187
01:54:14,833 --> 01:54:16,583
I'm working at info park.

2188
01:54:16,958 --> 01:54:19,583
I just shifted from 
Bangalore a month back.

2189
01:54:20,375 --> 01:54:21,833
I was all alone here.

2190
01:54:22,250 --> 01:54:24,458
Why alone, where 
is your husband?

2191
01:54:24,916 --> 01:54:27,291
You can't bear that some 
of us are still single?

2192
01:54:27,500 --> 01:54:30,166
You don't need to marry for that. 
You might have a boyfriend.

2193
01:54:30,166 --> 01:54:30,208
Who will love a 
girl like me S.K.

2194
01:54:30,375 --> 01:54:32,583
Who will love a 
girl like me S.K.

2195
01:54:35,833 --> 01:54:37,458
So what's the programme?

2196
01:54:38,500 --> 01:54:39,500
Nothing.

2197
01:54:40,458 --> 01:54:41,958
Let's play Anthakshari then.

2198
01:54:43,583 --> 01:54:45,125
[Apsara starts singing]

2199
01:54:51,208 --> 01:54:51,625
Mo.

2200
01:54:56,375 --> 01:54:58,625
[Rahul singing in 
the background]

2201
01:55:03,125 --> 01:55:04,125
Is that enough?

2202
01:55:04,458 --> 01:55:06,583
I have told you not to interfere 
in my private matters.

2203
01:55:06,583 --> 01:55:08,166
Do you know who she is. Apsara S. 
We studied in the same college.

2204
01:55:08,166 --> 01:55:09,958
- Apsara S. She is Apsaras. 
- huh?

2205
01:55:09,958 --> 01:55:10,000
The one that called me to chat yesterday. 
That's her.

2206
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,666
The one that called me to chat yesterday. 
That's her.

2207
01:55:12,666 --> 01:55:12,708
When she couldn't get Ka from me, 
she is here to get Mo from you.

2208
01:55:12,708 --> 01:55:16,416
When she couldn't get Ka from me, 
she is here to get Mo from you.

2209
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:24,250
Varghese who realized that agriculture 
life was never meant for Phantom.

2210
01:55:24,625 --> 01:55:26,333
Sold him for what he could get.

2211
01:55:27,083 --> 01:55:27,125
He's off with his new 
owners with hope.

2212
01:55:27,166 --> 01:55:31,125
He's off with his new 
owners with hope.
