1
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:11,767
"Come on, friend."

2
00:03:11,868 --> 00:03:15,531
"You're destined to keep walking."

3
00:03:15,605 --> 00:03:20,872
"Don't ever stop."

4
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:26,805
"Destiny comes searching for you."

5
00:03:27,016 --> 00:03:30,816
"That's the way you must sigh."

6
00:03:30,887 --> 00:03:32,286
Who's that?

7
00:03:40,029 --> 00:03:45,729
"My eyes conveyed to my heart."

8
00:03:45,801 --> 00:03:51,364
"Fill your life with new dreams."

9
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:57,068
"Fall in love with someone."

10
00:03:57,346 --> 00:04:03,012
"Be devoted to someone."

11
00:04:03,286 --> 00:04:09,589
"It's the dawn of new realization."

12
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:13,425
"Let's live on, says my heart."

13
00:04:14,664 --> 00:04:18,259
"It's the onset of dreams."

14
00:04:18,334 --> 00:04:20,928
"My prayers have been answered."

15
00:04:21,003 --> 00:04:25,667
"My heart says, let it live."

16
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:31,575
"Let it live, let this heart live."

17
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:37,449
"Let it live,
let it live this moment."

18
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:43,015
"Let it live, let it live this sight."

19
00:04:43,292 --> 00:04:49,288
"Let it live, let it live this love."

20
00:04:49,599 --> 00:04:52,067
"Let it live."

21
00:04:52,335 --> 00:04:55,361
"Let it live this beautiful moment."

22
00:04:55,438 --> 00:05:00,466
"Let me live it."

23
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,470
"Let it live."

24
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:06,538
"Let it live this beautiful moment."

25
00:05:06,749 --> 00:05:12,813
"Let me live it."

26
00:05:23,966 --> 00:05:26,867
"O, clouds."

27
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,804
"Wait for a minute."

28
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:35,572
"Let me live this ambience."

29
00:05:35,945 --> 00:05:41,383
"Shower those droplets,
blow those winds."

30
00:05:41,717 --> 00:05:46,017
"Wonder if i will get
this opportunity again."

31
00:05:46,288 --> 00:05:49,951
"My wishes have just been..."

32
00:05:50,026 --> 00:05:52,620
"...overcome by mischief."

33
00:05:52,695 --> 00:05:57,496
"The voice in my heart say
let it live."

34
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:03,004
"Let it live, let this heart live."

35
00:06:03,272 --> 00:06:08,767
"Let it live,
let it live this moment."

36
00:06:08,844 --> 00:06:14,441
"Let it live, let it live this sight."

37
00:06:14,684 --> 00:06:20,623
"Let it live, let it live this love."

38
00:06:21,257 --> 00:06:23,589
"Let it live."

39
00:06:23,659 --> 00:06:26,719
"Let it live this beautiful moment."

40
00:06:26,796 --> 00:06:31,756
"Let me live it."

41
00:06:32,535 --> 00:06:34,867
"Let it live."

42
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:37,872
"Let it live this beautiful moment."

43
00:06:38,307 --> 00:06:43,301
"Let me live it."

44
00:06:52,722 --> 00:06:53,882
Pull.

45
00:07:03,766 --> 00:07:04,892
Nice shot.

46
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:09,936
Do your friends always
stay with you with a gun?

47
00:07:10,005 --> 00:07:11,836
Yes, for my protection.

48
00:07:11,907 --> 00:07:13,499
Actually, when one acquires wealth...

49
00:07:13,576 --> 00:07:15,373
...you automatically make enemies.

50
00:07:22,518 --> 00:07:24,315
This money belongs to your father.

51
00:07:24,386 --> 00:07:25,717
Shouldn't he be
getting the protection?

52
00:07:25,788 --> 00:07:26,914
What about father?

53
00:07:26,956 --> 00:07:28,583
He's alive today,
he can be dead tomorrow.

54
00:07:28,758 --> 00:07:30,783
I alive right now,
and i will stay that way for long.

55
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,590
By the way, your father
was praising you a lot.

56
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:35,797
You heard all about me...

57
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:38,664
...and i don't want to hear about you.

58
00:07:39,969 --> 00:07:41,266
What do you do?

59
00:07:41,337 --> 00:07:42,429
Pull.

60
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:48,301
Oh, my!

61
00:07:50,646 --> 00:07:51,874
What about work?

62
00:07:52,314 --> 00:07:53,542
I've money in the bank.

63
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:55,411
I've to go to the bank every month.

64
00:07:55,451 --> 00:07:57,282
That's a lot of work itself.

65
00:07:57,353 --> 00:07:59,446
What will you do after you're married?

66
00:07:59,922 --> 00:08:00,946
What's there to do?

67
00:08:01,223 --> 00:08:03,589
I will go to kannada with you?
- Canada.

68
00:08:03,659 --> 00:08:06,389
Kannada.
- It's canada.

69
00:08:06,462 --> 00:08:09,590
The way you say it,
doesn't give a warm feeling.

70
00:08:09,932 --> 00:08:12,366
If you say "kannada", it feels homely.

71
00:08:12,735 --> 00:08:15,863
Like bhatinda. It's kannada.

72
00:08:17,239 --> 00:08:19,332
Tell me about your qualities...

73
00:08:19,408 --> 00:08:22,343
...which no girl can
refuse to marry you.

74
00:08:22,411 --> 00:08:24,345
I don't know about all the girls.

75
00:08:24,513 --> 00:08:27,277
But i have the three qualities...

76
00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:28,611
...that a sikh girl
would want in a man.

77
00:08:28,818 --> 00:08:31,412
Jatt. Jameen(land) and jeepsy.

78
00:08:37,526 --> 00:08:39,323
You rejected sunny.

79
00:08:39,461 --> 00:08:41,986
How much more adventure do you want?

80
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:46,265
All your friends are married now.

81
00:08:46,869 --> 00:08:49,804
But, uncle, i am not married yet.

82
00:08:50,005 --> 00:08:52,940
Softy, you are still unmarried...

83
00:08:53,008 --> 00:08:56,409
...because you're not as
beautiful as my daughter.

84
00:08:56,946 --> 00:08:58,675
Stop provoking her.

85
00:08:58,981 --> 00:09:03,213
Papa. I still have to do
many adventurous things in life.

86
00:09:03,285 --> 00:09:05,879
And you want to get me married...

87
00:09:05,955 --> 00:09:07,616
...to a boy who is good for nothing.

88
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:08,816
Correct.

89
00:09:08,991 --> 00:09:12,552
I am getting you married to
someone who's good for nothing.

90
00:09:12,661 --> 00:09:14,856
What can be a bigger
adventure than that?

91
00:09:15,397 --> 00:09:17,422
Just watch, father, i will run away.

92
00:09:18,234 --> 00:09:19,360
Run away?

93
00:09:19,568 --> 00:09:21,331
You will leave me alone.

94
00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:25,938
Your mother left me
and went away to kannada.

95
00:09:26,742 --> 00:09:30,303
Its canada, father.
- Yes, kannada.

96
00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:32,643
Ca... forget it.

97
00:09:32,882 --> 00:09:35,282
Carry on.
- I am done for.

98
00:09:35,551 --> 00:09:38,349
How will i face the society?

99
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,479
Father, stop being so dramatic.

100
00:09:41,323 --> 00:09:42,756
I will think about it.

101
00:09:43,525 --> 00:09:45,686
Four days later is the engagement.

102
00:09:45,761 --> 00:09:48,730
After that you can keep thinking.
- Hold on.

103
00:09:49,031 --> 00:09:50,362
Father. Four days...

104
00:09:50,432 --> 00:09:51,524
did he even ask me?

105
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,261
Before moving ahead...

106
00:09:53,335 --> 00:09:55,769
...let us show you the new
face of terror in hariyana...

107
00:09:55,838 --> 00:09:57,806
...who has been named chaudhary.

108
00:09:57,873 --> 00:10:00,569
Openly abducting anyone he wants...

109
00:10:00,643 --> 00:10:05,808
...proves that chaudhary is a
bigger power than the police.

110
00:10:12,588 --> 00:10:13,680
It's 5 o'clock.

111
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,451
Stop.

112
00:10:17,526 --> 00:10:18,686
Stop right there.

113
00:10:18,894 --> 00:10:20,657
Come here.

114
00:10:20,729 --> 00:10:21,821
Hello.

115
00:10:21,864 --> 00:10:24,662
You wake me up everyday at 5 o'clock.

116
00:10:25,067 --> 00:10:26,625
Can't you sleep at night?

117
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,496
Do you get nightmares?

118
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,333
Sir, people dream with
their eyes closed...

119
00:10:30,406 --> 00:10:31,737
...but i dream with my eyes open.

120
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:34,002
And dreams that are seen
with open eyes come true.

121
00:10:34,076 --> 00:10:35,407
I see.

122
00:10:35,778 --> 00:10:38,508
You want to be ambani,
driving a rickshaw.

123
00:10:38,647 --> 00:10:40,308
This three-wheeler
won't be sufficient.

124
00:10:40,382 --> 00:10:41,974
I will buy a four-wheeler car.

125
00:10:42,051 --> 00:10:43,575
You know shanty singh.

126
00:10:43,652 --> 00:10:44,949
From maholi.

127
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,045
He sold his rickshaw and bought a car.

128
00:10:47,323 --> 00:10:48,347
Innova.

129
00:10:48,557 --> 00:10:49,922
He earns 2500 a day.

130
00:10:49,992 --> 00:10:51,619
And fuel expenses separately.

131
00:10:51,694 --> 00:10:53,355
His car travels to all the places.

132
00:10:53,429 --> 00:10:55,329
Delhi, manali, ladakh.

133
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,024
It's good business.

134
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,826
I will buy a car as well.

135
00:10:58,901 --> 00:11:00,994
By selling my rickshaw?
- No, no.

136
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,562
What are you saying?

137
00:11:02,638 --> 00:11:05,038
I've earned rs.60,000 by
working hard for six years.

138
00:11:05,307 --> 00:11:06,501
I will invest some money...

139
00:11:06,575 --> 00:11:07,974
...and the bank will
provide me with the rest.

140
00:11:08,344 --> 00:11:09,811
Here, i earn rs.500 in a day.

141
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,607
And give you 300 from it.

142
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,341
There, i will earn 2500.

143
00:11:13,415 --> 00:11:14,507
And i will pay that
same amount to the bank...

144
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:15,641
...that i pay you.

145
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:18,619
I will visit the bank in a day
or two to get my loan approved.

146
00:11:18,687 --> 00:11:20,348
And then. You just watch

147
00:11:20,422 --> 00:11:22,287
i will buy my second,
third, fourth car.

148
00:11:22,358 --> 00:11:23,450
And then.

149
00:11:23,492 --> 00:11:25,426
I will leash all the
cars out like you...

150
00:11:25,494 --> 00:11:27,894
...and lead a peaceful life.

151
00:11:27,963 --> 00:11:29,988
My own travel agency.

152
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,594
Enough, mr. Ambani.

153
00:11:32,668 --> 00:11:34,329
You still have a long way to go...

154
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:35,700
...before you become
a rich man like me.

155
00:11:35,771 --> 00:11:37,636
Go, drive the rickshaw. Come on.

156
00:11:37,706 --> 00:11:39,799
And look, don't dream.

157
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:40,967
Go on.
- Yes.

158
00:11:41,043 --> 00:11:42,374
Carefully.

159
00:11:57,693 --> 00:12:00,958
Congratulations. Congratulations.

160
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,429
Here, here.

161
00:12:02,598 --> 00:12:04,964
Keep the car clean. Here.

162
00:12:05,034 --> 00:12:07,025
You have one too.

163
00:12:07,302 --> 00:12:09,827
Uncle.
- Rickshaw driver.

164
00:12:10,672 --> 00:12:12,367
Come on.

165
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:15,410
What's...
- here, have sweetmeat.

166
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:19,270
Your dream didn't let me sleep.

167
00:12:19,681 --> 00:12:20,807
Yes.

168
00:12:20,983 --> 00:12:22,507
I thought a lot about it.

169
00:12:22,584 --> 00:12:25,917
In the morning i
sold all the rickshaws.

170
00:12:27,356 --> 00:12:28,414
And look.

171
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:31,919
That car will go to delhi,
and that one to manali.

172
00:12:31,994 --> 00:12:33,655
And that one will go to ladakh.

173
00:12:34,396 --> 00:12:37,058
But, my money was in the rickshaw.

174
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:39,024
I checked everything.

175
00:12:39,435 --> 00:12:40,800
There was nothing.

176
00:12:40,869 --> 00:12:42,530
I had kept it under the seat.

177
00:12:42,604 --> 00:12:45,698
You fool, does anyone
keep money under the seat?

178
00:12:45,774 --> 00:12:47,435
Whom did you give the rickshaw to?

179
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:48,704
What is his name?

180
00:12:48,811 --> 00:12:49,903
Yes, neetu singh.

181
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:51,309
The garage owner.

182
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,371
He took all the
rickshaws this morning.

183
00:12:54,683 --> 00:12:56,446
You did the wrong thing.

184
00:12:56,518 --> 00:12:57,985
You rascal.

185
00:12:58,353 --> 00:13:02,289
I am feeding you sweets
and you are blaming me.

186
00:13:02,357 --> 00:13:04,621
It's my six year's earning.

187
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,623
That money is very important for me.

188
00:13:06,695 --> 00:13:07,787
Hey you.

189
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,661
It's very important for me.
- Throw him out of here.

190
00:13:09,731 --> 00:13:10,755
I earned that money with hard work.

191
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,926
Get out.
- Listen to me.

192
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:15,469
I've been working for six years.
- Get out.

193
00:13:15,537 --> 00:13:17,027
60,000 is a lot of money.

194
00:13:17,306 --> 00:13:18,466
Get out.

195
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,771
Rickshaw driver. Bothering the master.

196
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:30,011
Neetu singh's garage.

197
00:13:59,515 --> 00:14:01,779
Who asked you to keep
the money in the rickshaw?

198
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:03,950
If you have kept it here...

199
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:06,385
...i would've only
taken 700-800 from it.

200
00:14:06,522 --> 00:14:08,581
Now you have suffered
a loss of rs.60,000.

201
00:14:08,657 --> 00:14:11,592
Bhatti has gobbled up your money.

202
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:14,424
Here, drink up.

203
00:14:14,496 --> 00:14:16,589
Bhatti has gobbled up your money.

204
00:14:16,798 --> 00:14:18,265
Bhatti.

205
00:14:18,934 --> 00:14:22,392
Drink up, what are
you thinking? Drink it.

206
00:14:22,471 --> 00:14:23,733
Drink it.

207
00:14:23,805 --> 00:14:25,033
Drink it.

208
00:14:25,307 --> 00:14:27,775
Think about bhatti and drink up.

209
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:32,404
That's more like it.

210
00:14:39,688 --> 00:14:42,623
He has completely shattered his hopes.

211
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:47,994
Bhatti gobbled up my money.

212
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:52,693
Bhatti's gobbled up your money.

213
00:15:09,251 --> 00:15:10,411
Come, dear.

214
00:15:10,485 --> 00:15:12,419
My daughter. She's here.

215
00:15:13,655 --> 00:15:14,781
Uncle.

216
00:15:16,425 --> 00:15:18,017
Sit. Come.

217
00:15:19,361 --> 00:15:21,261
Come.

218
00:15:23,565 --> 00:15:24,657
Uncle.

219
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,808
Here.
- Here you go.

220
00:15:50,425 --> 00:15:55,021
'Bhatti is getting his
daughter married with your money.'

221
00:15:59,768 --> 00:16:04,535
'Now go and dance in
bhatti's daughter's marriage.'

222
00:16:05,574 --> 00:16:07,599
Celebrating with my money.

223
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:09,502
Bhatti!

224
00:16:14,283 --> 00:16:15,807
You?

225
00:16:16,418 --> 00:16:18,409
How dare you come inside?

226
00:16:18,487 --> 00:16:20,478
Bhatti!
- You are drunk.

227
00:16:20,756 --> 00:16:22,018
Get out.
- No.

228
00:16:22,557 --> 00:16:25,321
I am completely drunk.
- I said get out.

229
00:16:25,394 --> 00:16:27,828
Look, just return me
my money, that's all.

230
00:16:27,896 --> 00:16:29,295
What money?

231
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:30,626
The same thing again.

232
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:32,030
Get out of here.

233
00:16:32,434 --> 00:16:33,924
Return my money or else.

234
00:16:34,002 --> 00:16:36,300
Threatening me, are you?

235
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:38,703
What will you do? What will you do?

236
00:16:38,774 --> 00:16:42,301
You are elder to me, what can i do?

237
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:44,368
Yes. Get out of here.

238
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:45,839
I...

239
00:16:45,947 --> 00:16:48,313
will take this big chair and...

240
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,578
don't leave him.

241
00:16:50,652 --> 00:16:52,711
Throw him out.

242
00:16:53,789 --> 00:16:56,053
Leave me.

243
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:57,790
Throw him out.

244
00:16:57,859 --> 00:17:00,327
Hit him. Hit him.

245
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:05,628
He's taken the pistol out.
You might shoot it.

246
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:12,002
He shot it. He shot it.

247
00:17:18,814 --> 00:17:22,682
I want my money, or else
i will count till three.

248
00:17:22,718 --> 00:17:24,276
Or else i will shoot.

249
00:17:24,353 --> 00:17:25,752
Oh, so now you will count.

250
00:17:25,821 --> 00:17:26,913
This isn't a water-gun.

251
00:17:26,988 --> 00:17:28,683
We aren't playing 'holi'.

252
00:17:29,725 --> 00:17:30,851
One.

253
00:17:30,926 --> 00:17:32,393
Somebody please stop this man.

254
00:17:32,461 --> 00:17:33,587
Don't worry.

255
00:17:33,995 --> 00:17:35,895
Look at his hands trembling.

256
00:17:35,964 --> 00:17:37,898
If he shoots at left the
bullet will hit right.

257
00:17:37,966 --> 00:17:40,457
But we are in right.
- Quiet.

258
00:17:40,535 --> 00:17:42,435
Two.
- Look at him shaking.

259
00:17:42,504 --> 00:17:45,337
Shoot. Shoot.

260
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,868
You fool.

261
00:17:47,376 --> 00:17:48,741
Someone get him a
cold drink or something.

262
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,903
Two.
- Hit me.

263
00:17:50,979 --> 00:17:52,708
Come on. Here. Here.

264
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:54,043
I will shoot you.

265
00:17:54,316 --> 00:17:55,749
Shoot.

266
00:17:55,817 --> 00:17:56,943
Three.

267
00:17:57,686 --> 00:17:59,881
He shot

268
00:17:59,955 --> 00:18:01,718
uncle's been hit.

269
00:18:03,592 --> 00:18:06,618
I am hit. I am hit.

270
00:18:09,331 --> 00:18:10,423
Why did you say three?

271
00:18:10,499 --> 00:18:11,864
Normally three comes after two.

272
00:18:11,933 --> 00:18:13,400
And you were stuck on two.

273
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:14,730
So i thought you
don't know how to count.

274
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:16,668
I just wanted to help you.

275
00:18:17,873 --> 00:18:19,306
What should i do now?

276
00:18:19,374 --> 00:18:20,773
He's not hit.

277
00:18:20,842 --> 00:18:21,934
You're safe, mr. Bhatti.

278
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,773
Let me show you what to do.

279
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,541
What are you doing?

280
00:18:26,615 --> 00:18:29,914
Papa!
- My daughter.

281
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:32,647
Go get her,
he's abducting my daughter.

282
00:18:32,721 --> 00:18:34,621
Don't worry.

283
00:18:34,689 --> 00:18:35,747
Papa.

284
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:37,416
Papa, save me.

285
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:38,891
Save me.

286
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,451
Quickly, hurry up.
- You're crazy.

287
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:42,792
My daughter...

288
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:44,731
what are you doing?

289
00:18:46,034 --> 00:18:47,968
Father...
- he's taking her away.

290
00:18:48,036 --> 00:18:49,663
Brother.

291
00:18:49,704 --> 00:18:51,365
Let's go.

292
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,600
Let's go.

293
00:18:54,042 --> 00:18:55,703
This is not a rickshaw.

294
00:18:55,777 --> 00:18:57,039
Start it with the key.

295
00:18:57,412 --> 00:18:58,504
He's taking her away.

296
00:18:58,547 --> 00:19:03,450
Father! Help!

297
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,820
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

298
00:19:12,894 --> 00:19:13,952
I am driving.

299
00:19:13,995 --> 00:19:15,826
Hurry up.

300
00:19:16,331 --> 00:19:17,559
Come on.

301
00:19:21,736 --> 00:19:23,897
Shoot.
- Drive faster.

302
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:25,934
You're drunk.

303
00:19:26,007 --> 00:19:27,975
If the police catch
us you will be fined.

304
00:19:28,243 --> 00:19:30,302
You asked me to drive the car.

305
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:31,743
I only came from my home.

306
00:19:32,247 --> 00:19:33,714
Drive. Driver faster.

307
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:37,810
How cool. You've kidnapped me. Yes.

308
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:38,978
Kidnap?
- Yes.

309
00:19:39,254 --> 00:19:40,516
I kidnapped you?
- Yes.

310
00:19:40,589 --> 00:19:42,352
You made me kidnap you.

311
00:19:42,424 --> 00:19:44,392
It's the same thing.
I've been kidnapped.

312
00:19:44,426 --> 00:19:45,757
What nonsense.

313
00:19:48,864 --> 00:19:50,627
Drive faster or we will lose them.

314
00:19:50,699 --> 00:19:52,758
And they're showering bullets on us.

315
00:19:52,834 --> 00:19:54,802
Don't worry. I have observed them.

316
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:55,996
None of them can hit the target.

317
00:19:56,037 --> 00:19:57,629
Drive faster.

318
00:19:59,441 --> 00:20:00,874
Like i said.

319
00:20:00,942 --> 00:20:02,375
You are safe. Safe.

320
00:20:02,444 --> 00:20:03,604
Come on, come on.

321
00:20:12,687 --> 00:20:14,848
Oh, god!
- Oh, god!

322
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:18,826
Not bad.

323
00:20:18,894 --> 00:20:20,862
Do you drive the rickshaw similarly?

324
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:23,420
No, this has one extra wheel...

325
00:20:23,498 --> 00:20:25,466
...so i don't know which
direction the car's going.

326
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:28,398
Take the next left.
- What?

327
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:30,028
Take a left. Take a left.

328
00:20:32,007 --> 00:20:33,338
Turn, turn.

329
00:20:33,408 --> 00:20:35,569
Just a minute.
- Come on, come on.

330
00:20:41,683 --> 00:20:43,048
Where are you taking her?

331
00:20:43,318 --> 00:20:44,979
Once more. Once more.
- Once more?

332
00:20:45,053 --> 00:20:47,487
Making me go around in circles?

333
00:20:51,726 --> 00:20:53,717
What did i do?
- Straight. Straight.

334
00:21:01,603 --> 00:21:02,900
Quickly.

335
00:21:05,574 --> 00:21:06,666
Where did they go?

336
00:21:06,741 --> 00:21:09,369
They must have gone straight.
- Hurry up, come on.

337
00:21:09,444 --> 00:21:13,471
Don't worry, we will catch them.

338
00:21:34,369 --> 00:21:36,599
What did i do? What did i do?

339
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:38,434
Will you drink again?
Will you drink again?

340
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,673
Her father swindled my money,
and now she'll get me arrested.

341
00:21:42,611 --> 00:21:43,839
Oh no.

342
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:45,070
What did i do?

343
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:47,338
If you've finished
talking to yourself...

344
00:21:47,415 --> 00:21:48,643
...then can i say something?

345
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:51,712
I was the one who was
drunk and you lost your mind.

346
00:21:51,786 --> 00:21:53,378
What have you done?

347
00:21:53,421 --> 00:21:54,649
You kidnapped me.

348
00:21:54,723 --> 00:21:56,554
And everyone thinks i kidnapped you.

349
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:58,092
What kind of a kidnapping is this?

350
00:21:58,927 --> 00:22:00,417
I have a plan.

351
00:22:00,495 --> 00:22:01,826
Keep your idea to yourself.

352
00:22:01,896 --> 00:22:04,330
I am heading to nepal or someplace.
They will kill me here.

353
00:22:04,399 --> 00:22:07,300
Stop. Stop or else i will shoot you.

354
00:22:18,813 --> 00:22:21,611
I can get you your money back.

355
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:30,347
The entire police of
patiyala must be after you now.

356
00:22:30,425 --> 00:22:34,987
It's difficult to get a
job around punjab, hariyana.

357
00:22:35,397 --> 00:22:37,490
It'll take you at least 1-1a1/2 years...

358
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:39,658
...to look for a job somewhere else.

359
00:22:40,535 --> 00:22:42,867
By the way, how old are you?

360
00:22:45,674 --> 00:22:46,766
26.

361
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:52,513
That means by the time
you get a job you'll be 28.

362
00:22:53,848 --> 00:22:56,646
It took you four years to earn 60,000.

363
00:22:56,785 --> 00:22:59,879
This time it can
take you even six years.

364
00:23:00,455 --> 00:23:03,253
And you'll be... 34 years old.

365
00:23:03,858 --> 00:23:05,917
Then it will take you at
least six years more...

366
00:23:05,994 --> 00:23:10,363
...to fulfill your dreams.

367
00:23:10,899 --> 00:23:13,925
And you'll be...
- 40.

368
00:23:14,536 --> 00:23:16,333
40.

369
00:23:16,971 --> 00:23:19,405
Then a nice girl...

370
00:23:19,774 --> 00:23:22,641
at that age you'll
have to look for a woman.

371
00:23:23,044 --> 00:23:25,706
By the time you get married,
have kids...

372
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,907
when your children
are four years old...

373
00:23:28,316 --> 00:23:34,050
...they'll call you
grandpa instead of papa.

374
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:38,518
Now, do you like this long story or...

375
00:23:38,593 --> 00:23:39,821
...do you want to
hear the shorter one?

376
00:23:41,429 --> 00:23:42,555
Tell me the shorter one.

377
00:23:42,964 --> 00:23:45,626
Demand one million from
my father to release me.

378
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:46,894
Half yours and half mine.

379
00:23:46,968 --> 00:23:48,833
I don't want this easy-money.

380
00:23:50,772 --> 00:23:53,468
Fine, you can keep your 60,000...

381
00:23:53,508 --> 00:23:54,702
...and the rest will be mine.

382
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,746
Think quickly, grandpa.

383
00:24:03,318 --> 00:24:04,478
Fine.

384
00:24:05,286 --> 00:24:07,550
What will i have to do?
- Its simple.

385
00:24:07,622 --> 00:24:09,453
Just do as i say.

386
00:24:09,524 --> 00:24:11,754
First we'll have to look
for a place to stay. Come on.

387
00:24:23,838 --> 00:24:25,305
Open the door.

388
00:24:25,373 --> 00:24:27,398
What is your name?
- Viren.

389
00:24:27,776 --> 00:24:28,868
I am mini.

390
00:24:28,943 --> 00:24:30,877
Dance for me.

391
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,006
What?

392
00:24:33,281 --> 00:24:35,272
You didn't
understand or you didn't hear?

393
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:37,716
As i said, you'll do as i say.

394
00:24:37,786 --> 00:24:39,048
Come on, dance quickly.

395
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,288
Or else i will leave and they'll
come looking for you... - no, no.

396
00:24:41,322 --> 00:24:43,916
I'll do it. I'll do it.

397
00:24:46,361 --> 00:24:47,521
What is this?

398
00:24:47,796 --> 00:24:48,888
I am dancing. I am dancing.

399
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:51,464
Do it properly. Come on.

400
00:24:52,066 --> 00:24:55,558
I think this girl's crazy.

401
00:24:56,638 --> 00:24:58,469
Open up.

402
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:00,037
Open up.

403
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,836
Let's go.

404
00:25:19,661 --> 00:25:20,855
For the past two hours no one
has switched on the light...

405
00:25:20,929 --> 00:25:22,021
...or moved the curtains.

406
00:25:22,297 --> 00:25:23,628
It's bound to be empty.

407
00:25:23,965 --> 00:25:26,433
That's what you said for
the last house as well.

408
00:25:26,501 --> 00:25:28,731
But you ran faster than the dog.

409
00:25:30,305 --> 00:25:31,932
I've been running since i met you.

410
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,508
It's become a habit now.

411
00:25:37,645 --> 00:25:38,805
Come on.

412
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,446
Come on.

413
00:25:56,831 --> 00:25:59,322
Is this the time to
read other's letters?

414
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,992
There are unread letters
for the past two months.

415
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:02,896
The house is empty, let's go.

416
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:10,502
Come on.

417
00:26:27,362 --> 00:26:28,556
Viren

418
00:26:28,763 --> 00:26:29,957
come.

419
00:26:32,567 --> 00:26:35,263
I looked around, there's no one.
- No one, right.

420
00:26:35,603 --> 00:26:36,831
What are you doing?

421
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,977
Nice punch.

422
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:48,941
Come on.

423
00:27:12,507 --> 00:27:14,998
Viren. You are still outside.

424
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,977
Come inside, the house is empty.

425
00:27:17,245 --> 00:27:19,543
I'll go see whether
there's something to eat or not.

426
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:42,597
Tomorrow's plan.

427
00:27:43,438 --> 00:27:44,700
Tomorrow you will call my father...

428
00:27:44,772 --> 00:27:45,830
...and demand him one million.

429
00:27:45,907 --> 00:27:47,499
Okay.
- Deal. - fine.

430
00:27:47,608 --> 00:27:49,769
Let's go get some sleep.

431
00:27:53,848 --> 00:27:55,315
Where?

432
00:27:55,383 --> 00:27:57,476
Upstairs. To sleep.

433
00:27:58,052 --> 00:28:00,418
Just lie here quietly.

434
00:28:01,789 --> 00:28:03,780
I will go take a look upstairs.

435
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:05,984
Hello.

436
00:28:07,228 --> 00:28:08,490
Remember.

437
00:28:08,563 --> 00:28:10,793
If someone comes here
don't run away alone.

438
00:28:42,497 --> 00:28:45,022
I am famished.

439
00:28:49,037 --> 00:28:50,561
Poor viren.

440
00:28:53,441 --> 00:28:56,535
The hunger must be
keeping him awake as well.

441
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:27,270
Viren.

442
00:29:28,376 --> 00:29:29,502
Viren.

443
00:29:29,744 --> 00:29:32,474
Mother, let me sleep.

444
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,642
Get up.

445
00:29:36,717 --> 00:29:37,775
What happened?

446
00:29:37,852 --> 00:29:39,649
I couldn't sleep the entire
night because i was hungry...

447
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,654
...and you have been sleeping soundly.

448
00:29:41,722 --> 00:29:44,020
I' poor, i am used to
sleeping on an empty stomach.

449
00:29:45,593 --> 00:29:47,754
My black and white film hero...

450
00:29:47,929 --> 00:29:49,794
...do you have any money or not?

451
00:29:49,964 --> 00:29:51,363
Money?

452
00:29:58,306 --> 00:29:59,398
Here you go?

453
00:30:01,042 --> 00:30:02,771
Is that all?
- Yes.

454
00:30:02,844 --> 00:30:04,641
Your father took the rest.

455
00:30:04,912 --> 00:30:06,504
Look, don't you dare say
anything about my father...

456
00:30:06,581 --> 00:30:07,775
...otherwise i will...
- money.

457
00:30:08,516 --> 00:30:10,484
We can get money by selling this ring.

458
00:30:11,652 --> 00:30:13,984
This ring?
- Yes.

459
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:22,518
This is a hen that lays golden egg.

460
00:30:22,997 --> 00:30:24,828
We won't cut it.

461
00:30:26,767 --> 00:30:28,029
Then what will we do?

462
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,774
Yes, madam.
- Full tank.

463
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,786
"Touch."

464
00:31:03,337 --> 00:31:04,964
"Can i get you?"

465
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:08,265
"Can i touch you?"

466
00:31:08,342 --> 00:31:10,674
"Can i touch you?"

467
00:31:10,745 --> 00:31:11,871
"Can i touch you?"

468
00:31:11,946 --> 00:31:14,437
"Touch me, touch me, touch me."

469
00:31:14,515 --> 00:31:16,881
"Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me."

470
00:31:16,951 --> 00:31:19,886
"Hold me, hold me, hold me."

471
00:31:22,423 --> 00:31:24,448
"Touch me, touch me, touch me."

472
00:31:24,525 --> 00:31:26,789
"Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me."

473
00:31:26,861 --> 00:31:29,728
"Hold me, hold me, hold me."

474
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:36,363
We'll eat, drink and have a ball.

475
00:31:36,804 --> 00:31:39,796
"Hold me, hold me, hold me."

476
00:31:43,411 --> 00:31:46,869
I will talk to you later,
i'm busy at the moment.

477
00:31:56,657 --> 00:31:57,783
Hi.

478
00:31:57,959 --> 00:32:01,486
Myself so sweet
sardar shanty singh sunny.

479
00:32:01,562 --> 00:32:03,257
Owner of this petrol pump.

480
00:32:03,331 --> 00:32:05,390
What is your problem?

481
00:32:05,466 --> 00:32:08,333
My name's katrina kaur.

482
00:32:10,504 --> 00:32:14,770
While cleaning the car i lost my ring.

483
00:32:16,777 --> 00:32:18,802
Oh! Lord of rings!

484
00:32:18,879 --> 00:32:20,403
Was it an expensive one?

485
00:32:21,649 --> 00:32:23,617
It wasn't expensive.

486
00:32:23,684 --> 00:32:27,552
But it was close to my heart.

487
00:32:27,855 --> 00:32:30,653
And since i lost this ring...

488
00:32:30,858 --> 00:32:35,591
...my heart's been throbbing.

489
00:32:35,696 --> 00:32:36,856
Bill.

490
00:32:36,931 --> 00:32:38,558
And he's worried about the bill.

491
00:32:38,633 --> 00:32:41,568
You fool. You should be ashamed.

492
00:32:41,636 --> 00:32:43,661
Get out of here.

493
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,700
Look at the time.

494
00:32:47,808 --> 00:32:49,002
I am late.

495
00:32:49,076 --> 00:32:52,341
My strict father will be very angry.

496
00:32:52,546 --> 00:32:54,571
Don't worry, katrina.

497
00:32:54,649 --> 00:32:55,741
You go home.

498
00:32:55,816 --> 00:32:57,943
I will find and keep your ring.

499
00:32:58,019 --> 00:33:00,647
You come in the
evening and take your ring.

500
00:33:00,721 --> 00:33:06,284
After that you, me will get
to know each other better.

501
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,754
And the bill?

502
00:33:07,828 --> 00:33:08,954
Don't worry.

503
00:33:08,996 --> 00:33:11,988
When the heart's united,
why worry about the bill.

504
00:33:12,266 --> 00:33:13,699
Okay, thank you.

505
00:33:16,804 --> 00:33:20,262
God, don't make someone so gorgeous.

506
00:33:27,882 --> 00:33:30,009
Hey, mister. Stop, stop.

507
00:33:30,284 --> 00:33:31,410
This ring belongs to
shanty singh sunny.

508
00:33:31,485 --> 00:33:32,952
Give it back. Give it back.
- "Your ring?"

509
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:37,320
I found it lying here, now it's mine.
- Yours?

510
00:33:37,725 --> 00:33:41,456
I suggest that you take
rs.500 and give me the ring.

511
00:33:41,529 --> 00:33:43,895
500? It's worth at least 5000.

512
00:33:43,964 --> 00:33:45,488
I won't give it for 500.

513
00:33:45,966 --> 00:33:50,426
Ask for anything,
i will give you everything.

514
00:33:50,504 --> 00:33:52,938
Don't underestimate
shanty singh sunny.

515
00:33:52,973 --> 00:33:56,841
I would've even given you
10,000 for katrina's ring.

516
00:33:57,545 --> 00:34:00,981
And i would've have accepted
even rs.1000 for this ring.

517
00:34:20,468 --> 00:34:22,197
Bahadur, collect the
bill for number four.

518
00:34:26,974 --> 00:34:28,464
Sir, bill.

519
00:34:34,682 --> 00:34:35,842
Chotu.

520
00:34:36,884 --> 00:34:37,942
Come here.

521
00:34:39,019 --> 00:34:40,350
Here.

522
00:34:40,955 --> 00:34:42,718
Thank you, sir.
- Have fun.

523
00:34:45,826 --> 00:34:47,020
That was great.

524
00:34:47,628 --> 00:34:48,686
Shall we go home?

525
00:34:48,763 --> 00:34:51,288
No, let's go for a movie.

526
00:34:51,365 --> 00:34:52,662
Really?
- Yes. - which one?

527
00:34:53,334 --> 00:34:54,562
Call papa.

528
00:34:58,072 --> 00:34:59,403
Hello.

529
00:34:59,473 --> 00:35:03,500
Myself so sweet.
Sardar shanty singh sunny.

530
00:35:03,577 --> 00:35:05,943
Can i talk to katrina kaur?
- Katrina.

531
00:35:06,013 --> 00:35:07,275
Katrina.

532
00:35:07,715 --> 00:35:09,615
There's no katrina kaur here.

533
00:35:09,683 --> 00:35:11,776
You fool, disconnect the call.

534
00:35:24,765 --> 00:35:25,925
Hello.

535
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,899
Father.
- Who is it?

536
00:35:28,369 --> 00:35:30,303
It's viren.
- Viren, who?

537
00:35:30,371 --> 00:35:31,429
The rickshaw driver.

538
00:35:31,539 --> 00:35:32,801
Viren, you scoundrel.

539
00:35:32,873 --> 00:35:34,306
You abducted my daughter.

540
00:35:34,375 --> 00:35:36,434
How dare you call me?

541
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:39,035
Disconnect the call or
else i will beat you...

542
00:35:40,281 --> 00:35:41,908
he seems angry.

543
00:35:42,917 --> 00:35:44,680
So, did you expect him to
ask you about your well-being.

544
00:35:44,752 --> 00:35:46,947
Call him again, and this
time be stern, understand.

545
00:35:47,021 --> 00:35:49,581
And ask him for the money,
directly. Okay.

546
00:35:56,764 --> 00:35:59,426
Look, i want rs.60,000 or else...

547
00:35:59,667 --> 00:36:01,259
you are asking for rs.60,000.

548
00:36:01,335 --> 00:36:03,394
Demand for one million.

549
00:36:03,471 --> 00:36:04,836
Move aside. Give me the phone.

550
00:36:07,608 --> 00:36:10,304
Father!

551
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:12,004
Father! Father, save me.

552
00:36:12,279 --> 00:36:14,406
Father, please. Please, father.

553
00:36:14,482 --> 00:36:17,610
He has a gun as well.
Father, he's very dangerous.

554
00:36:17,685 --> 00:36:18,845
Father, he's
demanding for one million.

555
00:36:18,919 --> 00:36:20,477
Father, pay him up. Please.

556
00:36:20,554 --> 00:36:21,953
Father! Father!

557
00:36:22,857 --> 00:36:25,883
Leave me, please. Father!

558
00:36:37,671 --> 00:36:39,036
Mister, your packet.

559
00:36:43,878 --> 00:36:46,472
Why isn't the police doing anything?

560
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:49,515
I suggest that get his picture
published in the newspapers.

561
00:36:50,451 --> 00:36:53,477
Fine. Get that
rascal's picture published.

562
00:36:53,554 --> 00:36:54,646
Wanted.

563
00:36:54,722 --> 00:36:56,883
Just leave that to me.

564
00:36:56,957 --> 00:36:58,515
You don't worry.

565
00:36:58,926 --> 00:37:00,689
We will get his
picture from his house.

566
00:37:00,995 --> 00:37:02,622
Brothers.
- Yes, brother.

567
00:37:02,696 --> 00:37:04,561
Get the car.
- Okay.

568
00:37:04,632 --> 00:37:07,396
I will get him.
- Go.

569
00:37:10,004 --> 00:37:12,438
Wonder in what condition is mini in.

570
00:37:18,379 --> 00:37:19,539
Get it.

571
00:37:26,887 --> 00:37:28,684
You will write to father tomorrow.

572
00:37:28,756 --> 00:37:31,725
Threaten him and ask
him to get the money.

573
00:37:31,759 --> 00:37:32,691
Okay.
- Fine.

574
00:37:32,726 --> 00:37:35,627
I will go take a bath,
you cook the food.

575
00:37:37,765 --> 00:37:40,563
By, god. I am really hungry today.

576
00:37:40,968 --> 00:37:43,402
Let's see what you have prepared.

577
00:37:55,683 --> 00:37:57,446
What is this?

578
00:37:57,518 --> 00:37:59,452
Water. Here.

579
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,714
You call this food.

580
00:38:01,288 --> 00:38:02,516
I don't know how to cook.

581
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:03,989
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

582
00:38:04,258 --> 00:38:05,418
You would've scolded
me if i had told you.

583
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:06,891
You're scolding me even
when i didn't tell you.

584
00:38:06,961 --> 00:38:09,486
I thought its better to get
scolded after doing something.

585
00:38:09,563 --> 00:38:11,656
No one likes to be
scolded without doing anything.

586
00:38:11,732 --> 00:38:13,359
Okay, okay, sorry, sorry.

587
00:38:13,434 --> 00:38:14,526
It's my fault.

588
00:38:14,602 --> 00:38:16,661
I should've asked you.

589
00:38:17,237 --> 00:38:18,329
It's okay.

590
00:38:18,405 --> 00:38:19,565
How much money do you have left?

591
00:38:22,009 --> 00:38:23,442
When will he get the bread?

592
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,977
It's coming.

593
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,311
Tomorrow, that pump...

594
00:38:28,382 --> 00:38:29,713
sir, bread?

595
00:38:35,255 --> 00:38:36,517
Just one.

596
00:38:40,995 --> 00:38:42,326
Eat.

597
00:38:53,907 --> 00:38:58,276
By the way, you shouldn't
trouble your father like this.

598
00:38:59,413 --> 00:39:00,710
Where are your mother and father?

599
00:39:01,882 --> 00:39:03,247
In my native place.

600
00:39:03,684 --> 00:39:05,481
It's been six years
since i last met them.

601
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:08,813
And you think they aren't worried.

602
00:39:09,757 --> 00:39:10,985
It's different in my case.

603
00:39:11,759 --> 00:39:15,251
You're troubling
your father for money.

604
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:19,360
My father was getting
me married to sunny...

605
00:39:19,433 --> 00:39:21,492
...because i have a
green card of canada.

606
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:24,537
And their family is
filthy rich, to buy that card.

607
00:39:24,605 --> 00:39:25,867
So father was getting the money.

608
00:39:25,906 --> 00:39:27,271
Sunny, the green card.

609
00:39:27,341 --> 00:39:28,968
And i would've got a husband...

610
00:39:29,276 --> 00:39:31,744
...who was living on
his father's earning.

611
00:39:32,346 --> 00:39:33,711
If father had it his way...

612
00:39:33,747 --> 00:39:37,581
...then he would've got me
married to some rickshaw driver.

613
00:39:42,723 --> 00:39:44,714
I am... i am sorry...

614
00:39:44,792 --> 00:39:48,728
i didn't... no, really.

615
00:39:50,464 --> 00:39:52,591
Water?
- No.

616
00:39:54,435 --> 00:39:55,959
Should i order for something else?

617
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:58,633
If i could get some more bread?

618
00:39:59,006 --> 00:40:00,564
But we don't have money.

619
00:40:00,641 --> 00:40:03,804
We'll also have
sweets along with bread.

620
00:40:04,344 --> 00:40:05,641
Look.

621
00:40:06,714 --> 00:40:08,306
Come on, come on, come on.

622
00:40:11,852 --> 00:40:15,049
I am not helping you
in your antics again.

623
00:40:15,489 --> 00:40:17,821
You aren't adventurous at all.

624
00:40:17,891 --> 00:40:18,880
What?

625
00:40:18,959 --> 00:40:20,586
I have heard about chandra chur.

626
00:40:20,694 --> 00:40:21,752
Who is adventure?

627
00:40:23,831 --> 00:40:25,628
Adventurous.

628
00:40:25,799 --> 00:40:29,565
I mean you don't have that.

629
00:40:30,037 --> 00:40:32,505
That what's required,
you don't have it.

630
00:40:32,973 --> 00:40:35,601
What is that
everyone says i don't have?

631
00:40:35,676 --> 00:40:36,802
Courage.

632
00:40:38,345 --> 00:40:39,471
You don't have courage.

633
00:40:39,546 --> 00:40:40,877
You want sauce.

634
00:40:40,948 --> 00:40:42,779
Give him some sauce...

635
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:44,477
no, i said courage.

636
00:40:44,551 --> 00:40:46,314
She wants to say.

637
00:40:46,386 --> 00:40:50,618
You don't have the
courage to do anything.

638
00:40:52,459 --> 00:40:53,949
Would you like you
have good food as well?

639
00:40:54,495 --> 00:40:58,727
I am a good for nothing.

640
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:02,362
You are speaking too much.

641
00:41:02,436 --> 00:41:03,596
Do you want me to
speak in your language?

642
00:41:03,637 --> 00:41:04,763
You rascal.

643
00:41:04,838 --> 00:41:06,669
Simon, go back!
- Come on.

644
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,435
Simon, go back!

645
00:41:08,509 --> 00:41:10,477
Ask him go back.

646
00:41:10,511 --> 00:41:11,978
How does he know my name is simon?

647
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:21,510
How can we gatecrash in
someone's wedding uninvited?

648
00:41:23,957 --> 00:41:25,322
What?

649
00:41:27,561 --> 00:41:29,426
Mini, listen to me.

650
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,788
"Whether it's punjab
or anywhere else."

651
00:42:28,856 --> 00:42:31,324
"Jatt's have won every race."

652
00:42:31,391 --> 00:42:33,552
"But he drinks only in one condition."

653
00:42:33,594 --> 00:42:36,688
"Whether he's in love or not."

654
00:42:41,001 --> 00:42:43,697
"Whether it's punjab
or anywhere else."

655
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:46,330
"Jatt's have won every race."

656
00:42:46,406 --> 00:42:48,636
"But he drinks only in one condition."

657
00:42:48,709 --> 00:42:51,405
"Whether he's in love or not."

658
00:42:51,478 --> 00:42:53,708
"Until now i was a happy-go-lucky."

659
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:56,340
"Now you're general
and i am the soldier."

660
00:42:56,416 --> 00:42:58,748
"I swear on god."

661
00:42:58,819 --> 00:43:00,912
"I've surrendered because."

662
00:43:00,988 --> 00:43:03,422
"The heart's overwhelmed."

663
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:06,015
"This jatt's heart is overwhelmed."

664
00:43:06,293 --> 00:43:08,420
"The heart's overwhelmed."

665
00:43:08,495 --> 00:43:11,020
"This jatt's heart is overwhelmed."

666
00:43:11,298 --> 00:43:13,391
"The heart's overwhelmed."

667
00:43:13,467 --> 00:43:16,027
"This jatt's heart is overwhelmed."

668
00:43:16,303 --> 00:43:18,362
"The heart's overwhelmed."

669
00:43:18,438 --> 00:43:22,602
"This jatt's heart is overwhelmed."

670
00:43:31,051 --> 00:43:33,884
"I've surrendered before you."

671
00:43:36,056 --> 00:43:38,854
"I'm in love with you."

672
00:43:40,661 --> 00:43:43,721
"I'm in love with you."

673
00:43:43,797 --> 00:43:45,992
"Yeah."

674
00:43:46,433 --> 00:43:48,697
"I'm completely drunk today."

675
00:43:48,735 --> 00:43:51,397
"The matter's out of my hand now."

676
00:43:51,471 --> 00:43:53,530
"I'm completely drunk today."

677
00:43:53,607 --> 00:43:56,371
"I am in trouble. I am in trouble.
I am in trouble."

678
00:43:56,443 --> 00:43:58,741
"With that dazzling makeup."

679
00:43:58,812 --> 00:44:01,303
"She winked at me fatally."

680
00:44:01,381 --> 00:44:03,406
"With that dazzling makeup."

681
00:44:03,483 --> 00:44:06,247
"I am dead. I am dead. I am dead."

682
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:10,518
"I am dead. I am in trouble.
I am dead. I am in trouble."

683
00:44:11,658 --> 00:44:13,853
"Its smoking like a chimney,
because..."

684
00:44:13,961 --> 00:44:15,792
"the heart's overwhelmed."

685
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:18,831
"This jatt's heart is overwhelmed."

686
00:44:18,899 --> 00:44:20,799
"The heart's overwhelmed."

687
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:24,735
"This jatt's heart is overwhelmed."

688
00:44:33,747 --> 00:44:36,807
"I've surrendered before you."

689
00:44:46,393 --> 00:44:48,623
"Yeah."

690
00:44:48,862 --> 00:44:51,490
"She's new here."

691
00:44:51,565 --> 00:44:54,056
"She's brought new dreams along."

692
00:44:54,301 --> 00:44:56,462
"She's new here."

693
00:44:56,536 --> 00:44:58,970
"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."

694
00:44:59,006 --> 00:45:01,497
"Bow down and greet her."

695
00:45:01,575 --> 00:45:03,941
"She's your sister-in-law."

696
00:45:04,011 --> 00:45:06,479
"Bow down and greet her."

697
00:45:06,546 --> 00:45:08,810
"Bow down, bow down, bow down."

698
00:45:08,882 --> 00:45:09,974
"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."

699
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:11,547
"Bow down, bow down, bow down."

700
00:45:11,618 --> 00:45:13,347
"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."

701
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,984
"Bow down because..."

702
00:45:16,256 --> 00:45:18,520
"the heart's overwhelmed."

703
00:45:18,592 --> 00:45:21,493
"This jatt's heart is overwhelmed."

704
00:45:21,528 --> 00:45:23,462
"The heart's overwhelmed."

705
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:26,397
"This jatt's heart is overwhelmed."

706
00:45:26,466 --> 00:45:28,366
"The heart's overwhelmed."

707
00:45:28,435 --> 00:45:31,370
"This jatt's heart is overwhelmed."

708
00:45:31,438 --> 00:45:33,372
"The heart's overwhelmed."

709
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:37,536
"This jatt's heart is overwhelmed."

710
00:45:38,979 --> 00:45:42,312
"I'm in love with you."

711
00:45:44,684 --> 00:45:47,881
You drink so much? I am sober again.

712
00:45:51,858 --> 00:45:53,723
Climb up. Up.

713
00:45:53,794 --> 00:45:56,490
"The heart's..."

714
00:45:59,066 --> 00:46:00,294
carefully.

715
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,891
"The heart's..."

716
00:46:03,870 --> 00:46:05,303
carefully.

717
00:46:15,248 --> 00:46:18,843
First...
- don't ask me to dance now.

718
00:46:19,786 --> 00:46:21,413
Dance for me.

719
00:46:21,488 --> 00:46:23,012
I just danced so much.

720
00:46:23,290 --> 00:46:25,417
Hurry up or someone might come.

721
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,521
You have this strange
habit of making me dance.

722
00:46:29,596 --> 00:46:31,029
Fine, fine.

723
00:46:31,998 --> 00:46:33,397
Okay.

724
00:46:35,469 --> 00:46:37,960
Michael jackson.
- Who is he?

725
00:46:40,841 --> 00:46:44,504
I will give the music, dance along.

726
00:46:44,544 --> 00:46:45,738
Okay?

727
00:46:57,290 --> 00:46:58,951
Come.

728
00:47:19,312 --> 00:47:24,477
Can i... kiss you?

729
00:47:25,585 --> 00:47:27,610
What is that?

730
00:47:30,757 --> 00:47:32,554
Smooch...

731
00:47:46,439 --> 00:47:53,641
when i touch you how do you feel?

732
00:47:53,713 --> 00:47:55,840
I feel ticklish.

733
00:47:55,916 --> 00:47:58,282
Do you like it?

734
00:47:59,619 --> 00:48:01,211
Yes

735
00:48:01,788 --> 00:48:03,619

736
00:48:04,424 --> 00:48:05,482
What?

737
00:48:05,559 --> 00:48:06,719
Do it.

738
00:48:07,894 --> 00:48:09,486
Okay.

739
00:48:11,364 --> 00:48:14,424
Not that way.
- So?

740
00:48:16,303 --> 00:48:21,240
Now i will go up...

741
00:48:22,609 --> 00:48:27,308
...but you won't follow me.

742
00:48:27,814 --> 00:48:29,247
No.

743
00:48:31,885 --> 00:48:35,446
You will follow me.

744
00:48:35,522 --> 00:48:36,921
What are you saying?

745
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:41,324
You will do as i say,
that was the deal.

746
00:48:41,995 --> 00:48:43,394
What?

747
00:48:43,663 --> 00:48:49,795
You will do as i say,
that was our deal.

748
00:48:52,739 --> 00:48:54,604
Yes. Fine.

749
00:48:56,610 --> 00:48:57,770
Come on.

750
00:49:02,249 --> 00:49:04,547
"The heart's..."

751
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:13,352
i know what you want to do.

752
00:49:13,426 --> 00:49:14,825
I am not that dumb.

753
00:49:14,894 --> 00:49:17,328
All my friends go to munni.

754
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:18,690
But i never went to her.

755
00:49:18,765 --> 00:49:20,756
I hate such things.

756
00:49:22,335 --> 00:49:24,701
Whatever's happening is wrong...

757
00:49:24,771 --> 00:49:26,329
...but who can refuse you.

758
00:49:26,406 --> 00:49:28,374
You are foreign return.

759
00:49:28,441 --> 00:49:30,375
You know everything.

760
00:49:30,443 --> 00:49:33,241
What to do. How to do.

761
00:49:33,313 --> 00:49:35,804
You show me the way,
and i will follow.

762
00:49:35,882 --> 00:49:37,907
As things happen, with god's grace...

763
00:49:37,984 --> 00:49:40,452
...i will keep doing as you say.

764
00:49:41,321 --> 00:49:42,686
Okay.

765
00:49:45,592 --> 00:49:46,684
Listen.

766
00:49:47,961 --> 00:49:51,727
I don't think we should be doing this.

767
00:51:53,887 --> 00:51:58,551
Last night i had little too much...
- that's fine.

768
00:51:58,658 --> 00:52:00,853
People do absurd
things after getting drunk.

769
00:52:00,927 --> 00:52:02,326
Take a look at me.

770
00:52:02,429 --> 00:52:04,397
I got stuck in this
after getting drunk.

771
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:09,395
No need to worry.

772
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:11,965
I respect you a lot.

773
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:24,543
I've written this for your father.

774
00:52:24,617 --> 00:52:25,811
Ransom letter.

775
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:31,056
Respected... uncle.

776
00:52:33,793 --> 00:52:34,953
Read ahead.

777
00:52:36,429 --> 00:52:39,626
I hope that you are fine.

778
00:52:42,669 --> 00:52:43,931
Is this how you will write the letter?

779
00:52:44,604 --> 00:52:46,697
Why? It was nice.

780
00:52:46,973 --> 00:52:48,304
Should i get it typed?

781
00:52:49,642 --> 00:52:50,904
Blood letter.

782
00:52:53,546 --> 00:52:55,946
Until now i only
toiled hard to earn money.

783
00:52:56,015 --> 00:52:58,040
Today you made me bleed as well.

784
00:52:58,318 --> 00:53:02,345
This is called hard-earned money.

785
00:53:03,756 --> 00:53:06,520
It will take two days for
this letter to reach father.

786
00:53:06,593 --> 00:53:07,992
What should we do now?
- Two days.

787
00:53:08,428 --> 00:53:12,330
Why are you hitting me?
- What happened?

788
00:53:12,398 --> 00:53:14,559
I am not your grandson.
- Eloping with her.

789
00:53:14,634 --> 00:53:16,329
Listen to me.

790
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:20,398
He was eloping with the girl.

791
00:53:20,473 --> 00:53:22,373
What were you doing? Why
was the lady hitting you?

792
00:53:22,475 --> 00:53:23,942
I don't know.
- Shall i call the police?

793
00:53:24,010 --> 00:53:27,537
Why will you call the police.
- Catch him. Catch him.

794
00:53:27,614 --> 00:53:29,275
I will talk to the lady.
- Catch him.

795
00:53:29,349 --> 00:53:31,044
Ask her first.
- Catch him.

796
00:53:31,317 --> 00:53:32,682
Why are you surrounding me?

797
00:53:38,558 --> 00:53:40,355
Viren.
- Police...

798
00:53:40,426 --> 00:53:41,893
i am talking properly.

799
00:53:42,061 --> 00:53:43,892
Viren.
- What happened?

800
00:53:43,963 --> 00:53:45,487
Run.

801
00:53:45,565 --> 00:53:46,896
Look at the back.

802
00:53:48,334 --> 00:53:50,495
Why are we running?
- Run, or else you'll get thrashed.

803
00:53:50,603 --> 00:53:52,935
Why is everyone running after us.

804
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:56,035
Why are we running?

805
00:53:56,075 --> 00:53:57,804
And why are they following us?

806
00:53:57,877 --> 00:53:59,902
First dance for me.
- What?

807
00:53:59,979 --> 00:54:02,675
Dance for me.
- Someday you'll get me killed.

808
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:09,288
My photo's been published.

809
00:54:10,657 --> 00:54:12,420
Wanted.

810
00:54:13,426 --> 00:54:15,257
Your father's got me in trouble.

811
00:54:15,328 --> 00:54:16,989
My photo's been
published in the newspaper.

812
00:54:17,463 --> 00:54:18,987
They're coming. Run.

813
00:54:24,771 --> 00:54:25,897
They're gone.

814
00:54:25,972 --> 00:54:27,405
They made me run so much.

815
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:29,867
My legs are paining.

816
00:54:30,743 --> 00:54:31,869
I ran a lot.

817
00:54:31,945 --> 00:54:34,277
I am tired of running.

818
00:54:34,347 --> 00:54:35,473
He's tired. Madam.

819
00:54:35,548 --> 00:54:36,674
So try us.

820
00:54:36,749 --> 00:54:38,410
We won't tire easily.

821
00:54:39,953 --> 00:54:40,977
What did you say?

822
00:54:41,054 --> 00:54:42,453
We're from delhi.

823
00:54:42,522 --> 00:54:43,750
We have fallen for this girl.

824
00:54:43,823 --> 00:54:45,450
Now leave her right here
and get lost. Run away.

825
00:54:45,525 --> 00:54:46,617
Viren.

826
00:54:46,693 --> 00:54:47,785
What are you doing?

827
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:49,020
Have you lost your mind?

828
00:54:49,829 --> 00:54:50,989
Look at them.

829
00:54:51,064 --> 00:54:52,691
They will squash you...

830
00:54:52,765 --> 00:54:54,392
look at his muscles.

831
00:54:54,467 --> 00:54:56,298
He will beat you to a pulp. Come on.

832
00:54:57,604 --> 00:55:01,370
One needs courage to
fight and not muscles.

833
00:55:01,474 --> 00:55:02,839
Viren.

834
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:05,841
Viren. Chill. Control.

835
00:55:16,923 --> 00:55:18,823
You are cheating, you rascal.

836
00:55:18,891 --> 00:55:20,586
Take this.
- Good shot.

837
00:55:21,027 --> 00:55:23,587
Run. Run.

838
00:55:28,434 --> 00:55:31,597
Take this, you rascal.

839
00:55:32,905 --> 00:55:35,533
Viren, my hero.

840
00:55:36,376 --> 00:55:39,709
Awesome. Superb.

841
00:55:54,594 --> 00:55:56,892
They... they ran away.

842
00:55:59,332 --> 00:56:00,526
I am very hungry.

843
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,692
Are you hungry?

844
00:56:02,935 --> 00:56:05,768
Money?
- Yes, money.

845
00:56:06,706 --> 00:56:08,367
Money?

846
00:56:09,609 --> 00:56:11,474
I am not that hungry.

847
00:56:12,779 --> 00:56:13,837
Don't worry.

848
00:56:14,747 --> 00:56:16,374
We still have this.

849
00:56:16,783 --> 00:56:18,011
Once again?

850
00:56:18,818 --> 00:56:25,246
"My eyes... are tired."

851
00:56:26,793 --> 00:56:33,289
"How long will i
have to wait for you?"

852
00:56:34,701 --> 00:56:41,368
"My eyes... are tired."

853
00:56:42,975 --> 00:56:46,570
"You're my life."

854
00:56:46,646 --> 00:56:49,479
"My beloved."

855
00:56:51,050 --> 00:56:54,645
"You're dearer than life."

856
00:56:54,721 --> 00:56:57,690
"My beloved."

857
00:56:59,325 --> 00:57:02,488
"You're my life."

858
00:57:02,562 --> 00:57:05,531
"My beloved."

859
00:57:05,998 --> 00:57:10,935
"You're dearer than life."

860
00:57:11,003 --> 00:57:13,597
"My beloved."

861
00:57:13,906 --> 00:57:18,002
"I am waiting for you."

862
00:57:18,411 --> 00:57:22,279
"I am thinking about you."

863
00:57:22,348 --> 00:57:28,912
"Now i wish only for you."

864
00:57:28,955 --> 00:57:30,889
"Know that."

865
00:57:30,923 --> 00:57:34,984
"You...
- are love."

866
00:57:35,261 --> 00:57:39,357
"You...
- are devotion."

867
00:57:39,432 --> 00:57:45,462
"You...
- are the reason of my existence."

868
00:57:47,039 --> 00:57:51,499
"You...
- are habit."

869
00:57:51,544 --> 00:57:55,446
"You...
- are passion."

870
00:57:55,515 --> 00:58:01,943
"You...
- are the reason of my existence."

871
00:58:03,689 --> 00:58:10,288
"My eyes... are tired."

872
00:58:11,798 --> 00:58:18,294
"How long will i
have to wait for you?"

873
00:58:24,277 --> 00:58:31,683
"Somewhere here... i lost myself."

874
00:58:31,751 --> 00:58:39,590
"All i dream about is you."

875
00:58:39,659 --> 00:58:46,758
"The moments conspired
and brought us together."

876
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:54,902
"Gradually my heart
revealed without saying a word."

877
00:58:54,941 --> 00:58:59,002
"You entered my heart."

878
00:58:59,378 --> 00:59:02,939
"Like peace graced me."

879
00:59:03,349 --> 00:59:09,879
"Why won't i be restless now?"

880
00:59:09,956 --> 00:59:11,947
"Know that."

881
00:59:12,225 --> 00:59:15,991
"You...
- are love."

882
00:59:16,262 --> 00:59:19,959
"You...
- are devotion."

883
00:59:20,233 --> 00:59:27,230
"You...
- are the reason of my existence."

884
00:59:28,007 --> 00:59:32,273
"You...
- are habit."

885
00:59:32,345 --> 00:59:36,281
"You...
- are passion."

886
00:59:36,349 --> 00:59:43,653
"You...
- are the reason of my existence."

887
00:59:44,590 --> 00:59:49,960
"My eyes... are tired."

888
00:59:50,029 --> 00:59:52,827
"You are the reason of my existence."

889
00:59:52,899 --> 00:59:59,304
"How long will i
have to wait for you?"

890
01:00:00,773 --> 01:00:06,302
"My eyes... are tired."

891
01:00:06,345 --> 01:00:10,281
"You are the reason of my existence."

892
01:00:11,617 --> 01:00:14,950
Put it in a bag and
keep it near the red flag.

893
01:00:14,987 --> 01:00:17,615
Otherwise your daughter...

894
01:00:18,057 --> 01:00:20,287
uncle, don't you worry.

895
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:21,924
He can't be so bold.

896
01:00:22,628 --> 01:00:24,994
This must be the blood
of some hen or something.

897
01:00:25,064 --> 01:00:26,793
This is my hen's...

898
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:29,058
my daughter's blood.

899
01:00:29,335 --> 01:00:30,495
My blood.

900
01:00:31,470 --> 01:00:32,960
He has asked me to
bring one million...

901
01:00:33,039 --> 01:00:35,439
...to the ground
behind the 'lakkad bazaar'

902
01:00:35,574 --> 01:00:37,439
otherwise he will...

903
01:00:37,743 --> 01:00:41,474
where will i get one million from?
- Don't worry, uncle.

904
01:00:41,547 --> 01:00:43,742
We will go with you
along with the money.

905
01:00:43,816 --> 01:00:44,942
Right, brothers?

906
01:00:45,017 --> 01:00:47,315
Are you all ready?
- Yes, of course.

907
01:01:08,941 --> 01:01:10,272
So quiet.

908
01:01:10,676 --> 01:01:12,610
This is the first
time i saw you so quiet.

909
01:01:15,047 --> 01:01:16,776
You aren't saying anything either.

910
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:21,486
I... i am not saying
anything because...

911
01:01:21,554 --> 01:01:22,578
i am not saying anything because...

912
01:01:22,655 --> 01:01:24,953
...i am not happy at all.
- Why?

913
01:01:25,658 --> 01:01:26,750
Why aren't you happy?

914
01:01:26,826 --> 01:01:28,350
Our deal will be finalized today.

915
01:01:28,394 --> 01:01:29,554
We're getting the money as well.

916
01:01:30,963 --> 01:01:33,295
On that note let me dance for you.

917
01:01:33,366 --> 01:01:34,526
Here.

918
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:46,378
Today after you get your money...

919
01:01:46,445 --> 01:01:47,673
...then where will you go?

920
01:01:48,781 --> 01:01:49,941
I...

921
01:01:50,716 --> 01:01:52,343
i will go back.

922
01:01:52,852 --> 01:01:54,479
You can take all the money.

923
01:01:54,553 --> 01:01:55,713
Why will you go back home?

924
01:01:55,788 --> 01:01:57,756
If you go back you
will have to marry sunny.

925
01:01:57,823 --> 01:01:58,983
You won't go back.

926
01:01:59,725 --> 01:02:01,283
You're so concerned about me.

927
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:03,453
You won't go back, mini.
- Why?

928
01:02:04,330 --> 01:02:08,494
Because...
- because now we are good friends...

929
01:02:08,567 --> 01:02:11,502
...or... are we very good friends?

930
01:02:12,772 --> 01:02:14,603
We...
- we are very good friends.

931
01:02:14,673 --> 01:02:16,732
Shall i come along with you?
- What? Where?

932
01:02:16,809 --> 01:02:19,573
Timbuktu. What
difference does it make?

933
01:02:19,645 --> 01:02:21,909
Look, mini, you are
not going anywhere.

934
01:02:21,981 --> 01:02:23,949
Drop this useless idea.

935
01:02:24,016 --> 01:02:25,711
Take your money and...

936
01:02:42,802 --> 01:02:45,999
i don't want to go back.

937
01:02:46,072 --> 01:02:48,006
I will come along with you, please.

938
01:02:48,074 --> 01:02:52,636
Look, i will finance your
idea of 'chotu travels'.

939
01:02:52,711 --> 01:02:54,303
We both can be business partners.

940
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:56,405
Look, please don't send me back.

941
01:02:56,482 --> 01:02:57,813
I will...

942
01:02:58,684 --> 01:03:00,015
quiet.

943
01:03:01,487 --> 01:03:02,886
Sit quietly.

944
01:03:51,070 --> 01:03:52,799
Since when has sanjay dutt's photo...

945
01:03:52,872 --> 01:03:54,305
...printed on currency notes?

946
01:03:59,512 --> 01:04:00,638
What is happening?

947
01:04:00,713 --> 01:04:01,873
Is it diwali today?

948
01:04:02,348 --> 01:04:03,542
Wait a minute.

949
01:04:04,717 --> 01:04:05,843
Aim properly.

950
01:04:05,918 --> 01:04:07,385
We will nail him.

951
01:04:07,453 --> 01:04:09,318
Shoot. Shoot.

952
01:04:09,388 --> 01:04:11,549
Sunny.
- Shoot him.

953
01:04:12,625 --> 01:04:13,922
It's your fianca©.

954
01:04:13,993 --> 01:04:15,585
But why is he firing at us?

955
01:04:15,895 --> 01:04:17,556
Why is he so angry?

956
01:04:17,830 --> 01:04:18,922
What is it?

957
01:04:20,332 --> 01:04:22,823
You could've taken it out yourself.
- Move.

958
01:04:22,902 --> 01:04:25,029
I don't want to get shot
in the crossfire. - What?

959
01:04:25,304 --> 01:04:26,999
You were ready to go
to timbuktu with me.

960
01:04:27,273 --> 01:04:28,365
And now you're asking me to get away.

961
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:29,566
Shoot him.

962
01:04:29,642 --> 01:04:30,836
Have you lost your mind?

963
01:04:30,910 --> 01:04:32,673
My daughter might get hit.
- Nothing will happen.

964
01:04:32,745 --> 01:04:34,906
We will not spare him.

965
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:37,813
Listen to us. Listen.
- Don't fire.

966
01:04:37,883 --> 01:04:39,817
Wait a minute. I will take a look.

967
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:42,649
Listen. Listen.

968
01:04:42,721 --> 01:04:44,916
Uncle, please. Don't worry.

969
01:04:47,026 --> 01:04:48,459
Shoot.

970
01:04:53,465 --> 01:04:54,557
What happened?

971
01:04:54,633 --> 01:04:56,362
Someone's firing from
the other side as well.

972
01:04:56,435 --> 01:04:58,403
Maybe someone might save us.

973
01:05:07,646 --> 01:05:08,806
Who is he?

974
01:05:08,881 --> 01:05:10,542
I don't know who he is.

975
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:19,791
Mini.

976
01:05:24,930 --> 01:05:26,989
Where are you taking my daughter?

977
01:05:27,499 --> 01:05:28,693
Stop.

978
01:05:29,034 --> 01:05:30,968
Mini. Mini.

979
01:05:31,770 --> 01:05:33,965
They're gone. Someone stop him. Mini.

980
01:05:34,039 --> 01:05:35,438
Stop.

981
01:05:36,542 --> 01:05:38,806
First my daughter was kidnapped.

982
01:05:39,044 --> 01:05:41,706
Now the kidnapper's
been kidnapped as well.

983
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:43,941
Don't you know?
- Come on, hurry up.

984
01:05:44,016 --> 01:05:45,347
Strange.

985
01:06:13,281 --> 01:06:15,112
'Not just my daughter...

986
01:06:15,183 --> 01:06:17,651
...but now her kidnapper's
been kidnapped as well.'

987
01:06:46,715 --> 01:06:48,546
Hail lord mahadev.

988
01:06:49,017 --> 01:06:51,451
Are you giving him a hug?

989
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:52,577
Well done, well done.

990
01:06:52,954 --> 01:06:54,182
Hold on to his cloth.

991
01:06:54,289 --> 01:06:55,483
Hold on.

992
01:07:06,935 --> 01:07:08,095
Well done, well done.

993
01:07:29,624 --> 01:07:31,182
What's happening?

994
01:07:47,108 --> 01:07:48,473
Hey, uncle.

995
01:07:48,610 --> 01:07:50,043
What are we doing here?

996
01:07:50,145 --> 01:07:52,636
Is this the way, you
forcefully brought us here.

997
01:07:54,616 --> 01:07:55,913
Chaudhary.

998
01:07:57,285 --> 01:07:59,549
My name is chaudhary.

999
01:08:00,889 --> 01:08:05,451
I am not your relative.

1000
01:08:06,294 --> 01:08:08,922
And the only relation
i have with anyone...

1001
01:08:08,997 --> 01:08:10,555
...is that i am chotu's father.

1002
01:08:11,433 --> 01:08:12,525
Chotu.

1003
01:08:14,502 --> 01:08:17,960
To hell with your six footer chotu...

1004
01:08:18,339 --> 01:08:19,636
where is my chotu?

1005
01:08:20,241 --> 01:08:22,641
Chotu. Chotu.

1006
01:08:23,511 --> 01:08:25,536
Chotu.
- Mother.

1007
01:08:26,915 --> 01:08:28,075
How are you, chotu?

1008
01:08:28,650 --> 01:08:30,345
Where did you go
leaving your mother alone?

1009
01:08:30,418 --> 01:08:33,012
You troubled us a lot. My child.

1010
01:08:33,088 --> 01:08:34,350
Aunt.

1011
01:08:35,256 --> 01:08:36,348
He's chotu.

1012
01:08:36,691 --> 01:08:38,215
Are you crazy?

1013
01:08:38,393 --> 01:08:41,021
He's my chotu. Isn't it?

1014
01:08:43,264 --> 01:08:44,356
Uncle.

1015
01:08:44,999 --> 01:08:46,091
Is he chotu?

1016
01:08:51,106 --> 01:08:52,266
Are you chotu?

1017
01:08:54,442 --> 01:08:56,501
I will tell you what he is.

1018
01:09:16,631 --> 01:09:20,897
Chaudhary's son drives
a rickshaw in the city.

1019
01:09:21,202 --> 01:09:23,500
Do you want a tight slap?
- Stop it now.

1020
01:09:23,905 --> 01:09:25,668
He has returned after so many years.

1021
01:09:25,974 --> 01:09:27,305
And you're already scolding him.

1022
01:09:27,375 --> 01:09:31,004
For six years your uncle has
been protecting you in the city.

1023
01:09:31,079 --> 01:09:33,479
I had been receiving all
the information about you.

1024
01:09:35,650 --> 01:09:39,245
When i saw your photo in
the newspaper "wanted".

1025
01:09:39,587 --> 01:09:41,316
I felt so proud.

1026
01:09:42,357 --> 01:09:45,155
I thought that it took time...

1027
01:09:45,226 --> 01:09:46,557
...but finally my blood
showed its true colors.

1028
01:09:47,128 --> 01:09:48,925
Then your uncle told me...

1029
01:09:48,997 --> 01:09:52,865
...that the girl abducted you,
you didn't abduct her.

1030
01:09:54,235 --> 01:09:56,100
I felt so ashamed.

1031
01:10:00,475 --> 01:10:01,635
It's okay.

1032
01:10:02,277 --> 01:10:03,608
Whatever happened was the past.

1033
01:10:04,045 --> 01:10:09,108
Now this girl wants one
million from her father...

1034
01:10:09,184 --> 01:10:10,481
...in return of her freedom.

1035
01:10:11,619 --> 01:10:13,143
We will ask for 1.5.

1036
01:10:15,123 --> 01:10:18,889
Look, dear. Don't be too relieved.

1037
01:10:19,093 --> 01:10:22,085
From today you're chaudhary's guest.

1038
01:10:27,969 --> 01:10:29,231
So cool.

1039
01:10:29,270 --> 01:10:31,261
You're the son of
such a dangerous man.

1040
01:10:31,339 --> 01:10:32,670
You didn't tell me.

1041
01:10:32,941 --> 01:10:34,101
Kidnapped.

1042
01:10:34,342 --> 01:10:35,434
You've been kidnapped.

1043
01:10:35,944 --> 01:10:37,104
Do you understand?

1044
01:10:38,012 --> 01:10:39,536
Be thankful that you are
freely roaming around.

1045
01:10:39,614 --> 01:10:41,582
Otherwise you would've been
locked up in one of these rooms.

1046
01:10:42,483 --> 01:10:45,145
My father's profession
is to kidnap people.

1047
01:10:46,521 --> 01:10:49,046
My father wanted me to
enter this profession, as well.

1048
01:10:49,224 --> 01:10:50,452
He would train me.

1049
01:10:50,658 --> 01:10:52,387
"Go and get the neighbor's hen."

1050
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:54,087
"Go and get the neighbor's goat."

1051
01:10:54,495 --> 01:10:56,156
One day he sent me to get the bullock.

1052
01:10:56,864 --> 01:10:59,560
I ran for my life
and never looked back.

1053
01:10:59,934 --> 01:11:02,459
And you say that i trouble my parents.

1054
01:11:04,005 --> 01:11:05,563
You know of my friends...

1055
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:07,198
...someone's father would sell milk...

1056
01:11:07,275 --> 01:11:08,867
...while someone would run a shop.

1057
01:11:08,943 --> 01:11:11,138
My father would abduct their father.

1058
01:11:11,212 --> 01:11:14,147
'Agva house'. That's what
the villagers call this place.

1059
01:11:16,050 --> 01:11:17,950
My uncle raised me.

1060
01:11:19,587 --> 01:11:21,248
Father was always
'farrari' (on the run).

1061
01:11:21,956 --> 01:11:23,218
Ferrari?

1062
01:11:24,359 --> 01:11:26,919
He would always be
on the run. My father.

1063
01:11:29,063 --> 01:11:31,258
Have you heard about guru wrestler?

1064
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:33,326
Uncle is his son.

1065
01:11:33,534 --> 01:11:35,331
And my father's childhood friend.

1066
01:11:35,903 --> 01:11:37,336
Father was such a good friend...

1067
01:11:37,538 --> 01:11:39,438
...that he didn't
let him go back home.

1068
01:11:39,907 --> 01:11:41,431
Since them uncle's
been living with us.

1069
01:11:42,076 --> 01:11:44,476
Uncle never says anything.

1070
01:11:44,912 --> 01:11:46,004
Like they say.

1071
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:48,048
Only a mother what
her child wants to say.

1072
01:11:49,651 --> 01:11:53,052
Father understands
what uncle wants to say.

1073
01:11:53,421 --> 01:11:56,322
Brother chotu.
- Dhani.

1074
01:11:57,558 --> 01:11:59,025
So you have finally returned?

1075
01:11:59,093 --> 01:12:01,186
No, i didn't. I have brought back.

1076
01:12:01,896 --> 01:12:04,296
You know, brother, i
looked everywhere for you.

1077
01:12:04,365 --> 01:12:06,299
Rajdhani, paschim express.

1078
01:12:06,367 --> 01:12:07,994
I searched all the trains.

1079
01:12:08,102 --> 01:12:10,502
But you... were nowhere to be found.

1080
01:12:12,507 --> 01:12:15,999
You are so gorgeous.

1081
01:12:16,077 --> 01:12:18,238
God save you from evil-eyes.

1082
01:12:18,313 --> 01:12:19,610
I am leaving.

1083
01:12:23,918 --> 01:12:25,010
She's my sister.

1084
01:12:25,386 --> 01:12:26,978
She's the station master's daughter.

1085
01:12:27,355 --> 01:12:29,050
Station master's daughter?

1086
01:12:29,324 --> 01:12:31,053
Actually, she was four year old...

1087
01:12:31,125 --> 01:12:33,218
...when she called my father "father".

1088
01:12:33,294 --> 01:12:36,161
My father was so overwhelmed...

1089
01:12:36,197 --> 01:12:37,425
...that he brought her home.

1090
01:12:38,099 --> 01:12:40,033
She robs passengers in moving trains.

1091
01:12:40,201 --> 01:12:41,463
Rajdhani is her specialty.

1092
01:12:41,536 --> 01:12:42,662
Really.
- Yes.

1093
01:12:43,004 --> 01:12:44,596
That's why she's been named dhani.

1094
01:12:45,406 --> 01:12:47,636
She stole... your earrings.

1095
01:12:53,981 --> 01:12:57,348
I want everything finalized.

1096
01:12:57,518 --> 01:12:58,610
I don't want any delay.

1097
01:12:58,886 --> 01:13:00,012
Brother naidu.

1098
01:13:00,521 --> 01:13:02,421
Chotu.

1099
01:13:03,157 --> 01:13:06,923
Where were you?

1100
01:13:07,328 --> 01:13:09,125
The entire family was worried.

1101
01:13:09,197 --> 01:13:10,926
I was worried myself.

1102
01:13:11,032 --> 01:13:12,329
I take part in the elections...

1103
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:14,334
...and you disappear for five years.

1104
01:13:14,936 --> 01:13:17,905
Did you see hariyana's
sport's centre while coming here?

1105
01:13:17,972 --> 01:13:19,098
How was it?

1106
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:20,898
They brought me tied up in a sack?

1107
01:13:20,975 --> 01:13:22,067
How could i see it?

1108
01:13:22,110 --> 01:13:23,543
Tied in a sack.

1109
01:13:23,611 --> 01:13:25,476
Uncle brought you back.

1110
01:13:27,315 --> 01:13:28,976
Chotu. Friend.

1111
01:13:29,350 --> 01:13:30,442
Hello.

1112
01:13:30,918 --> 01:13:33,546
I am fighting for woman equality.

1113
01:13:33,621 --> 01:13:36,089
Cast your valuable vote to me.

1114
01:13:36,290 --> 01:13:37,484
Okay?
- Okay.

1115
01:13:37,558 --> 01:13:38,650
Okay?
- Okay.

1116
01:13:38,926 --> 01:13:40,484
Shout slogans for chotu

1117
01:13:40,561 --> 01:13:42,028
long live chotu.

1118
01:13:42,096 --> 01:13:43,529
Long live chotu.
- Fine.

1119
01:13:43,598 --> 01:13:45,065
Long live chotu.
- Fine, fine.

1120
01:13:45,133 --> 01:13:48,159
Okay, chotu. I am leaving now.
I will call you later.

1121
01:13:49,470 --> 01:13:51,495
My elder brother.
- South indian.

1122
01:13:51,572 --> 01:13:52,539
Yes.

1123
01:13:52,607 --> 01:13:54,472
Years ago a minister from andhra...

1124
01:13:54,542 --> 01:13:56,567
...borrowed money from
father to contest the elections.

1125
01:13:57,178 --> 01:14:00,170
He wasn't returning the money
after winning the elections.

1126
01:14:00,281 --> 01:14:01,578
So father went to his house...

1127
01:14:01,849 --> 01:14:03,214
...and started taking all the things.

1128
01:14:03,451 --> 01:14:07,888
Just then there was a
child sitting on the chair...

1129
01:14:07,955 --> 01:14:10,185
...and he wasn't
getting off the chair.

1130
01:14:10,925 --> 01:14:13,257
And boy isn't ready
to get off even today.

1131
01:14:13,528 --> 01:14:14,961
My brother naidu.

1132
01:14:15,396 --> 01:14:16,488
I get it.

1133
01:14:16,564 --> 01:14:18,054
Your mother.

1134
01:14:18,232 --> 01:14:21,531
Your father must have
brought her from a television set.

1135
01:14:21,903 --> 01:14:23,495
She so overacting.

1136
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:27,204
"Chotu. Chotu."

1137
01:14:27,508 --> 01:14:28,566
Minnie.

1138
01:14:28,976 --> 01:14:32,571
In this house, only me
and my mother are original.

1139
01:14:33,981 --> 01:14:36,313
I am sorry.
- By the way.

1140
01:14:36,417 --> 01:14:38,908
Father would keep
anyone he liked at home.

1141
01:14:39,253 --> 01:14:40,982
Will he like me?

1142
01:14:41,355 --> 01:14:44,256
Don't rack your brains too much.

1143
01:14:44,559 --> 01:14:46,390
I will elope with
you in two-three days.

1144
01:14:46,461 --> 01:14:47,655
What's the hurry?

1145
01:14:48,029 --> 01:14:50,361
We will stay back for a week or two.
- No, no.

1146
01:14:50,431 --> 01:14:51,420
Let's stay back for a month.

1147
01:14:51,499 --> 01:14:53,933
Let's start living here.
- Okay, thank you.

1148
01:14:54,268 --> 01:14:56,168
Mini. Mini, listen...

1149
01:14:58,539 --> 01:15:01,269
father asked me to
dress you up properly.

1150
01:15:01,843 --> 01:15:03,936
You are looking so sweet.

1151
01:15:04,011 --> 01:15:05,342
Dhani.
- Yes.

1152
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:07,175
These earrings look
really nice on you.

1153
01:15:07,248 --> 01:15:08,078
They do, don't they?

1154
01:15:08,149 --> 01:15:09,343
I bought them from delhi.

1155
01:15:10,017 --> 01:15:11,951
You can come along as well,
i will buy them for you too.

1156
01:15:14,355 --> 01:15:16,323
Don't look at me like that.

1157
01:15:16,390 --> 01:15:17,982
I didn't steal them.

1158
01:15:18,092 --> 01:15:20,287
This is called trickery.

1159
01:15:21,028 --> 01:15:22,256
What's the difference?

1160
01:15:22,430 --> 01:15:25,627
One steals covertly.

1161
01:15:26,033 --> 01:15:28,866
And tricking someone is a bold job.

1162
01:15:29,103 --> 01:15:32,368
When someone's robbed he gets sad.

1163
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:36,342
But when someone's
tricked he's amazed.

1164
01:15:36,410 --> 01:15:39,243
That's the difference
between the two. - I see.

1165
01:15:40,581 --> 01:15:42,572
Since when have you been doing this?

1166
01:15:42,917 --> 01:15:47,081
Look, as a child i was
very interested in magic.

1167
01:15:47,221 --> 01:15:49,951
I used to make coins
appear from thin air.

1168
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:53,987
But now that i have grown up...

1169
01:15:54,061 --> 01:15:56,154
...i make them disappear
from the pocket of people.

1170
01:15:56,230 --> 01:15:58,198
Will you teach me as well?
- Yes, why not.

1171
01:15:58,266 --> 01:16:01,201
Look, while taking your hands
near the face, the earrings...

1172
01:16:01,269 --> 01:16:04,670
dhani. Not this.

1173
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:09,567
I want to learn the
bewitchment in your eyes.

1174
01:16:13,948 --> 01:16:16,314
Go on now, don't get to sweet.

1175
01:16:21,255 --> 01:16:23,985
Now you look like a woman.

1176
01:16:24,058 --> 01:16:25,992
You look so
beautiful in these clothes.

1177
01:16:27,094 --> 01:16:28,220
Sit.

1178
01:16:29,230 --> 01:16:31,061
Slice the onions diagonally.

1179
01:16:49,283 --> 01:16:52,275
Don't you know how to cook food?

1180
01:16:54,288 --> 01:16:56,483
There was no one to teach me.

1181
01:16:56,557 --> 01:17:00,459
Why? Was your mother busy in
kitty parties the entire day?

1182
01:17:03,564 --> 01:17:06,533
I was very young when
my mother passed away.

1183
01:17:13,140 --> 01:17:14,630
Forgive me, dear.

1184
01:17:14,976 --> 01:17:18,070
Even i have grown brazen
living with chaudhary.

1185
01:17:19,246 --> 01:17:21,305
Enough, stop crying now.

1186
01:17:22,016 --> 01:17:23,984
I will teach you how to cook food.

1187
01:17:24,685 --> 01:17:26,277
Give me the onions.

1188
01:17:48,943 --> 01:17:50,103
Mother.

1189
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:57,039
Ask that aunt to use
less clarified butter.

1190
01:17:57,652 --> 01:17:59,017
Don't worry, dear.

1191
01:17:59,086 --> 01:18:00,883
We will use less
clarified butter in your food.

1192
01:18:03,257 --> 01:18:04,281
Go. Go outside.

1193
01:18:04,358 --> 01:18:05,950
Take a walk around.

1194
01:18:07,228 --> 01:18:09,389
Mother. Can i take an apple?

1195
01:18:19,206 --> 01:18:22,937
The doctor we had
abducted from faridabad.

1196
01:18:23,044 --> 01:18:24,341
Have they sent the
ransom amount for him?

1197
01:18:24,412 --> 01:18:25,504
Yes, they did.

1198
01:18:25,579 --> 01:18:28,139
I released him this morning.

1199
01:18:28,215 --> 01:18:29,614
Mr. Chaudhary.

1200
01:18:29,650 --> 01:18:30,981
What did you do?

1201
01:18:31,052 --> 01:18:32,246
He's not my husband?

1202
01:18:32,319 --> 01:18:33,547
He is not that old?

1203
01:18:33,621 --> 01:18:35,521
I paid the entire ransom.

1204
01:18:35,556 --> 01:18:37,956
And this is what you send me.

1205
01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:39,649
What is she saying, jatta?

1206
01:18:40,094 --> 01:18:42,289
Take a good look,
lady. It must be him.

1207
01:18:42,363 --> 01:18:44,263
Aren't you her husband?

1208
01:18:44,465 --> 01:18:46,956
I... i...

1209
01:18:47,034 --> 01:18:49,525
why are you stammering?

1210
01:18:51,172 --> 01:18:52,298
What's going on, man?

1211
01:18:52,373 --> 01:18:54,204
What did you feed my father?

1212
01:18:54,275 --> 01:18:56,072
How did he grow so young?

1213
01:18:56,143 --> 01:18:57,440
Where's my original father.

1214
01:18:58,012 --> 01:19:00,344
He's my husband.
- Papa.

1215
01:19:01,248 --> 01:19:02,510
Son.

1216
01:19:03,284 --> 01:19:06,276
You are here.
- Thank god i found you.

1217
01:19:09,056 --> 01:19:11,320
Have you lost your mind?

1218
01:19:11,525 --> 01:19:13,186
You never do anything right.

1219
01:19:13,561 --> 01:19:15,028
Uncle.

1220
01:19:16,163 --> 01:19:17,357
Listen.

1221
01:19:17,565 --> 01:19:18,964
And that girl.

1222
01:19:19,033 --> 01:19:21,024
Wonder what she's made of.

1223
01:19:21,102 --> 01:19:22,364
She keeps jumping
around the entire day.

1224
01:19:25,973 --> 01:19:26,564
Hello.

1225
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:28,574
Mr. Chaudhary, i have
sent the ransom amount.

1226
01:19:28,642 --> 01:19:30,166
Yes, we received the money.

1227
01:19:30,277 --> 01:19:32,245
Why did you send the wrong husband?
- What?

1228
01:19:32,613 --> 01:19:34,376
We've delivered your husband home.

1229
01:19:34,648 --> 01:19:35,945
That's it.

1230
01:19:36,117 --> 01:19:38,085
Your husband's a lawyer, right?

1231
01:19:38,119 --> 01:19:41,088
No, chaudhary, my
husband's the doctor. - What?

1232
01:19:41,188 --> 01:19:43,315
He's a doctor.
- Exactly.

1233
01:19:44,058 --> 01:19:48,324
You fool, you delivered the
lawyer instead of the doctor.

1234
01:19:50,097 --> 01:19:51,997
It's okay, keep the lawyer.
- What?

1235
01:19:52,066 --> 01:19:54,432
He will earn more than the doctor.

1236
01:19:54,502 --> 01:19:56,595
You never do anything right.

1237
01:19:56,871 --> 01:19:57,929
Your beards have grown white...

1238
01:19:58,005 --> 01:19:59,495
...but haven't learnt any sense.

1239
01:20:00,207 --> 01:20:01,333
Uncle

1240
01:20:02,643 --> 01:20:04,907
have you gone crazy?

1241
01:20:05,146 --> 01:20:06,477
Why are you ranting "uncle, uncle"?

1242
01:20:06,547 --> 01:20:08,071
Uncle. Come here.

1243
01:20:08,149 --> 01:20:09,480
Why so restless?

1244
01:20:10,217 --> 01:20:11,616
Why are you ranting "uncle, uncle"?

1245
01:20:11,886 --> 01:20:14,116
I have an idea.

1246
01:20:14,188 --> 01:20:17,316
It won't take me long to
knock some sense in you.

1247
01:20:17,424 --> 01:20:18,516
At least listen to me first.

1248
01:20:18,592 --> 01:20:20,890
Trying to knock some
sense in me for no reason.

1249
01:20:20,995 --> 01:20:22,519
There's so much
confusion in your setup.

1250
01:20:22,897 --> 01:20:24,057
Don't talk too much.

1251
01:20:24,131 --> 01:20:25,325
Go mind your own business.

1252
01:20:25,399 --> 01:20:26,957
I was doing just that.

1253
01:20:27,168 --> 01:20:30,626
My mother drove me out
of the kitchen. - Mother?

1254
01:20:31,372 --> 01:20:33,966
Aunt asked me to call her mother.

1255
01:20:35,109 --> 01:20:37,304
By the way, how long have
you been doing this business?

1256
01:20:38,579 --> 01:20:40,672
I started when i was 18.

1257
01:20:41,048 --> 01:20:42,675
Day after i will be 60.

1258
01:20:43,918 --> 01:20:45,146
Day after you'll be 60.

1259
01:20:45,252 --> 01:20:47,584
And soon you'll be 80.

1260
01:20:48,355 --> 01:20:51,119
You will have to bring a
change in business sometime.

1261
01:20:51,192 --> 01:20:53,319
What do you mean?
- Sit.

1262
01:20:58,032 --> 01:20:59,863
Those who come here...

1263
01:21:00,267 --> 01:21:02,326
...stay for at least two-three weeks.

1264
01:21:02,403 --> 01:21:05,099
I mean you must
provide for their food.

1265
01:21:06,006 --> 01:21:09,567
Three meals a day, a cot for resting.

1266
01:21:09,910 --> 01:21:13,368
Table lamp and a 100 watt bulb.

1267
01:21:13,614 --> 01:21:17,050
I am sure you pay for table,
fan and light bill...

1268
01:21:17,318 --> 01:21:19,309
...or do you get
electricity illegally.

1269
01:21:20,087 --> 01:21:22,317
Do you understand what i am saying?

1270
01:21:22,656 --> 01:21:24,988
You provide three meals a day.

1271
01:21:25,059 --> 01:21:27,084
Do you know how much
clarified butter's used?

1272
01:21:27,261 --> 01:21:28,592
I just saw.

1273
01:21:28,662 --> 01:21:31,256
They use one tin just for a lentil.

1274
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:38,599
I was saying, those who
stay back for so long...

1275
01:21:38,672 --> 01:21:40,537
...should pay interest,
shouldn't they?

1276
01:21:40,641 --> 01:21:42,040
What are you saying?

1277
01:21:42,109 --> 01:21:43,440
I should appoint an accountant now...

1278
01:21:43,544 --> 01:21:46,308
...to keep a record of
who comes and who goes?

1279
01:21:46,614 --> 01:21:49,174
The accountant's right in your hands.

1280
01:21:49,984 --> 01:21:53,283
This is a telephone.
- It's a unique phone, uncle.

1281
01:21:53,454 --> 01:21:56,116
Do you know the features that it has?

1282
01:21:57,324 --> 01:21:59,451
What is feature called in hindi?

1283
01:21:59,526 --> 01:22:01,494
I understand that much.

1284
01:22:02,463 --> 01:22:04,897
I can make and
receive telephone calls.

1285
01:22:05,132 --> 01:22:07,191
What other feature does it have?

1286
01:22:07,401 --> 01:22:09,494
Give me your phone.

1287
01:22:10,137 --> 01:22:13,231
Give it. I won't run away with it.

1288
01:22:17,011 --> 01:22:20,606
Hey you.
- I was just joking.

1289
01:22:21,248 --> 01:22:24,217
Look. This is a organizer.

1290
01:22:25,085 --> 01:22:26,518
The day your guest comes in...

1291
01:22:26,587 --> 01:22:29,181
...feed in his name
along with the date.

1292
01:22:29,256 --> 01:22:32,282
Give ten days time to his family,
for the delivery.

1293
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:36,186
Ten days later the alarm
will sound automatically...

1294
01:22:36,263 --> 01:22:38,060
...whose delivery is due when.

1295
01:22:38,332 --> 01:22:40,129
If the money arrives in
10 days, then its fine...

1296
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:42,065
...otherwise start charging interest.

1297
01:22:42,336 --> 01:22:45,567
Now i will feed my name.

1298
01:22:46,006 --> 01:22:48,941
I arrived on 31st october.

1299
01:22:49,009 --> 01:22:50,601
That means this month is over.

1300
01:22:50,978 --> 01:22:53,071
You have demanded 1.5
million from father.

1301
01:22:53,147 --> 01:22:54,876
It will take the
entire month of november...

1302
01:22:54,949 --> 01:22:56,473
...to gather 1.5 million.

1303
01:22:56,917 --> 01:22:58,612
Then comes december.

1304
01:22:59,153 --> 01:23:02,589
Won't we celebrate
christmas together in december?

1305
01:23:03,190 --> 01:23:04,953
Then comes january.

1306
01:23:05,092 --> 01:23:08,459
Yes, i will feed 26th january in here.

1307
01:23:08,996 --> 01:23:10,395
It's an auspicious day.

1308
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:13,900
But you will charge me
interest only after 26th january.

1309
01:23:14,368 --> 01:23:16,893
Just so that there's no confusion...

1310
01:23:16,971 --> 01:23:19,906
...let's click a photo and
save it along with the name.

1311
01:23:20,341 --> 01:23:21,205
Here.

1312
01:23:21,275 --> 01:23:22,367
Smile.

1313
01:23:25,879 --> 01:23:27,141
Superb.

1314
01:23:28,182 --> 01:23:31,379
You did understand...
what i said, didn't you?

1315
01:23:31,618 --> 01:23:32,880
Think about it.

1316
01:23:36,557 --> 01:23:39,082
That girl seems very intelligent.

1317
01:23:39,460 --> 01:23:41,155
Demand 500,000 more.

1318
01:23:42,029 --> 01:23:44,156
Mister, this is wrong.

1319
01:23:44,231 --> 01:23:46,597
Look, first chaudhary
sir demand 1.5 million.

1320
01:23:46,667 --> 01:23:48,191
Now he's asking for two.

1321
01:23:48,268 --> 01:23:50,293
How will i arrange
for that kind of money?

1322
01:23:50,938 --> 01:23:54,499
Tell chaudhary sir...

1323
01:23:54,908 --> 01:23:56,273
listen...

1324
01:24:00,214 --> 01:24:04,844
mini, why are you
getting so valuable by the day?

1325
01:24:05,085 --> 01:24:06,609
One, two, three, four...

1326
01:24:06,887 --> 01:24:08,616
five, six, seven, eight...

1327
01:24:17,131 --> 01:24:20,157
what are you doing?
That's not the way to do it.

1328
01:24:20,467 --> 01:24:21,866
Wait. Stop.

1329
01:24:21,935 --> 01:24:23,493
One, two, three, four...

1330
01:24:32,179 --> 01:24:33,043
mini!

1331
01:24:34,014 --> 01:24:34,981
Mini!

1332
01:24:35,582 --> 01:24:37,516
Why do you keep ranting
her name the entire day?

1333
01:24:37,885 --> 01:24:39,250
Is she your wife?

1334
01:24:39,353 --> 01:24:41,253
No, she's my responsibility.

1335
01:24:41,321 --> 01:24:44,313
Responsibility or girlfriend.
- What did you say?

1336
01:24:44,391 --> 01:24:45,881
What are you doing?

1337
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:47,957
Your responsibility is upstairs.

1338
01:24:48,028 --> 01:24:49,518
She's making the boys work out.

1339
01:24:51,231 --> 01:24:52,289
Quiet.

1340
01:24:54,101 --> 01:24:55,466
Do it properly.

1341
01:24:55,569 --> 01:24:57,867
One, two, three, four...

1342
01:24:58,205 --> 01:24:59,365
one, two, one...

1343
01:24:59,907 --> 01:25:01,272
one, two, one...

1344
01:25:01,575 --> 01:25:02,507
one, two...

1345
01:25:02,943 --> 01:25:04,274
one, two, one...

1346
01:25:04,344 --> 01:25:05,436
one, two, one...

1347
01:25:05,512 --> 01:25:06,945
what are you doing?

1348
01:25:07,081 --> 01:25:09,049
Do it along with me.

1349
01:25:09,216 --> 01:25:11,150
One, two, three, four...

1350
01:25:11,218 --> 01:25:13,152
one, two...

1351
01:25:16,623 --> 01:25:18,113
minnie.
- Hi, chotu.

1352
01:25:18,192 --> 01:25:19,955
What are you making them do?

1353
01:25:20,027 --> 01:25:21,494
Look at their condition.

1354
01:25:21,562 --> 01:25:22,620
They will die.

1355
01:25:22,896 --> 01:25:26,332
Chotu, they have
blown up hogging on food.

1356
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,231
And they do only one exercise.

1357
01:25:28,302 --> 01:25:30,998
Up-down, up-down, up-down.

1358
01:25:31,071 --> 01:25:32,129
Just watch.

1359
01:25:32,206 --> 01:25:36,142
In ten days i will turn them
into john abraham in underwear.

1360
01:25:37,077 --> 01:25:38,374
Minnie. Minnie. Minnie.

1361
01:25:38,445 --> 01:25:40,345
You're not here for 10 days.

1362
01:25:40,447 --> 01:25:41,573
Why, chotu?

1363
01:25:41,648 --> 01:25:44,549
Why are you calling me chotu?

1364
01:25:44,618 --> 01:25:48,213
Everyone calls you chotu at home.

1365
01:25:48,388 --> 01:25:50,185
And i am family now as well.

1366
01:25:50,257 --> 01:25:52,555
And i don't hate you as well.

1367
01:25:52,626 --> 01:25:53,888
Chotu.

1368
01:25:54,895 --> 01:25:56,157
Let's go from here, come on.
- Okay.

1369
01:25:56,497 --> 01:25:57,555
Let go off my hand.

1370
01:25:59,900 --> 01:26:01,265
Mini...

1371
01:26:01,335 --> 01:26:04,361
look, tonight i will come for you.
- On a horse?

1372
01:26:04,438 --> 01:26:05,632
Minni, listen carefully.

1373
01:26:05,672 --> 01:26:07,071
Be ready, okay.

1374
01:26:07,174 --> 01:26:10,268
As a bride?
- Why don't you understand?

1375
01:26:10,511 --> 01:26:13,446
It's very important for
you to go back to your house.

1376
01:26:15,048 --> 01:26:17,380
Earlier you were
saying "don't go back home".

1377
01:26:17,451 --> 01:26:18,975
"You will have to marry sunny."

1378
01:26:19,286 --> 01:26:20,685
Now you want to send me back home.

1379
01:26:20,954 --> 01:26:22,012
With that same sunny.

1380
01:26:22,289 --> 01:26:24,314
I don't want you to get
married to someone else.

1381
01:26:26,627 --> 01:26:28,527
I mean with sunny.

1382
01:26:29,163 --> 01:26:30,994
Look, i am coming for you tonight.

1383
01:26:31,064 --> 01:26:32,463
Just be ready.

1384
01:26:32,599 --> 01:26:34,567
I will go with you on one condition.

1385
01:26:34,968 --> 01:26:36,936
Do you agree?
- What's the condition?

1386
01:26:40,674 --> 01:26:43,370
You will come on a
sparkling white horse.

1387
01:26:44,511 --> 01:26:49,448
And you will take me along
in a flower decorated car.

1388
01:26:52,986 --> 01:26:59,892
So... will you marry... a useless...
rickshaw driver?

1389
01:27:02,663 --> 01:27:06,292
Don't underestimate chotu so much?

1390
01:27:19,479 --> 01:27:22,346
"I am floored."

1391
01:27:22,416 --> 01:27:25,317
"I am floored."

1392
01:27:26,053 --> 01:27:30,683
"It's not my fault."

1393
01:27:30,991 --> 01:27:33,653
"I am floored."

1394
01:27:33,927 --> 01:27:36,623
"I am floored."

1395
01:27:37,564 --> 01:27:42,433
"The heart's helpless."

1396
01:27:42,469 --> 01:27:45,165
"I am floored."

1397
01:27:45,339 --> 01:27:48,399
"I am floored."

1398
01:27:48,642 --> 01:27:53,909
"You touched my heart with your eyes."

1399
01:27:54,248 --> 01:27:57,581
"You've answered my prayers."

1400
01:27:58,151 --> 01:28:00,142
"I am floored."

1401
01:28:00,220 --> 01:28:05,453
"You're my world."

1402
01:28:05,926 --> 01:28:09,487
"You add sparkle to my life."

1403
01:28:11,632 --> 01:28:17,195
"You touched my heart with your eyes."

1404
01:28:17,437 --> 01:28:21,271
"You've answered my prayers."

1405
01:28:23,176 --> 01:28:28,204
"You're my world."

1406
01:28:28,682 --> 01:28:33,551
"You add sparkle to my life."

1407
01:28:33,987 --> 01:28:36,182
"O beloved."

1408
01:28:36,256 --> 01:28:39,157
"O beloved."

1409
01:28:39,626 --> 01:28:45,030
"O beloved. O beloved."

1410
01:28:45,399 --> 01:28:47,458
"O beloved."

1411
01:28:47,567 --> 01:28:51,059
"O beloved."

1412
01:28:51,138 --> 01:28:56,337
"O beloved. O beloved."

1413
01:29:14,995 --> 01:29:24,461
"I've found the
closeness in these distances."

1414
01:29:26,273 --> 01:29:35,477
"Secretly, the eyes made a
pact with the heart of love."

1415
01:29:36,616 --> 01:29:39,449
"I am floored."

1416
01:29:39,519 --> 01:29:42,010
"I am floored."

1417
01:29:43,390 --> 01:29:48,089
"It's not my fault."

1418
01:29:48,161 --> 01:29:53,895
"Bring me the stars and the moon."

1419
01:29:54,935 --> 01:29:59,531
"And take me away."

1420
01:29:59,606 --> 01:30:01,904
"O beloved."

1421
01:30:01,975 --> 01:30:05,035
"O beloved."

1422
01:30:05,412 --> 01:30:10,440
"O beloved. O beloved."

1423
01:30:11,118 --> 01:30:13,211
"O beloved."

1424
01:30:13,286 --> 01:30:16,653
"O beloved."

1425
01:30:16,923 --> 01:30:22,259
"O beloved. O beloved."

1426
01:30:23,363 --> 01:30:28,665
"There was something missing in life."

1427
01:30:29,169 --> 01:30:33,299
"But i never realized."

1428
01:30:35,008 --> 01:30:37,306
"When we met."

1429
01:30:37,611 --> 01:30:44,517
"It felt like god's
blessing showering on me."

1430
01:30:45,285 --> 01:30:48,083
"I am floored."

1431
01:30:48,155 --> 01:30:51,386
"I am floored."

1432
01:30:51,925 --> 01:30:56,419
"It's not my fault."

1433
01:30:56,496 --> 01:31:02,401
"It was god's will that we meet."

1434
01:31:03,336 --> 01:31:08,171
"We've been blessed with his grace."

1435
01:31:08,241 --> 01:31:10,266
"O beloved."

1436
01:31:10,410 --> 01:31:13,436
"O beloved."

1437
01:31:14,047 --> 01:31:19,280
"O beloved. O beloved."

1438
01:31:19,619 --> 01:31:21,883
"O beloved."

1439
01:31:21,955 --> 01:31:25,391
"O beloved."

1440
01:31:25,459 --> 01:31:31,091
"O beloved. O beloved."

1441
01:31:50,116 --> 01:31:51,413
Where is she?

1442
01:31:55,088 --> 01:31:56,248
That's dhani.

1443
01:32:01,161 --> 01:32:02,355
Aunt laxmi.

1444
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:08,360
Mother.

1445
01:32:12,405 --> 01:32:13,303
Mini.

1446
01:32:13,874 --> 01:32:14,568
Mini.

1447
01:32:15,475 --> 01:32:16,635
Mini. Mini.

1448
01:32:17,277 --> 01:32:18,972
Let's run away. This
is a good opportunity.

1449
01:32:19,312 --> 01:32:20,210
Mini.

1450
01:32:21,047 --> 01:32:22,173
Mini.

1451
01:32:22,649 --> 01:32:23,638
Mini, get up.

1452
01:32:24,150 --> 01:32:25,048
Mini.

1453
01:32:25,552 --> 01:32:26,484
Mini.

1454
01:32:27,020 --> 01:32:28,487
Mini.

1455
01:32:28,522 --> 01:32:29,580
Mini.

1456
01:32:33,527 --> 01:32:35,222
It's easy to wake up
someone who's sleeping.

1457
01:32:35,395 --> 01:32:36,362
But impossible to wake up...

1458
01:32:36,429 --> 01:32:37,589
...those who have turned a blind-eye.

1459
01:32:39,266 --> 01:32:41,461
Mini. Mini.

1460
01:32:42,202 --> 01:32:44,033
Fine. I am leaving.

1461
01:33:04,624 --> 01:33:05,921
Viren, you.

1462
01:33:32,118 --> 01:33:33,551
But why are we running?

1463
01:33:33,620 --> 01:33:34,985
This place is so cool.

1464
01:33:35,021 --> 01:33:36,420
It's important to leave from here...

1465
01:33:48,268 --> 01:33:49,565
i... i...

1466
01:33:49,936 --> 01:33:51,164
uncle.

1467
01:33:51,237 --> 01:33:53,467
She was running away. I
arrived at the right time.

1468
01:33:53,907 --> 01:33:55,340
You should keep a watch.

1469
01:33:57,877 --> 01:33:58,901
What if she had escaped?

1470
01:33:59,012 --> 01:34:00,070
Not just the loss.

1471
01:34:00,180 --> 01:34:01,613
But father would've been defamed.

1472
01:34:01,982 --> 01:34:02,971
And you.

1473
01:34:03,116 --> 01:34:05,141
Don't you dare try to escape again?

1474
01:34:06,186 --> 01:34:07,244
Take care of her.

1475
01:34:12,492 --> 01:34:13,857
Goodnight.

1476
01:34:23,136 --> 01:34:24,194
Mother.

1477
01:34:24,638 --> 01:34:26,196
Shall i take it, for father?

1478
01:34:26,306 --> 01:34:28,638
You will serve him food.

1479
01:34:30,610 --> 01:34:32,043
Fine, take it.

1480
01:34:33,546 --> 01:34:34,945
Wait, wait, wait.

1481
01:34:35,348 --> 01:34:37,043
Cover your head.

1482
01:34:37,283 --> 01:34:40,252
Chaudhary's slightly old-fashioned.

1483
01:34:44,457 --> 01:34:45,617
This way.

1484
01:34:47,127 --> 01:34:49,618
This organizer is a great thing.

1485
01:34:50,330 --> 01:34:51,422
Wow.

1486
01:34:52,999 --> 01:34:54,466
Great. Really helpful.

1487
01:35:11,317 --> 01:35:12,875
The food's really tasty.

1488
01:35:13,086 --> 01:35:15,611
Who cooked it?
- Uncle, i did.

1489
01:35:17,257 --> 01:35:19,282
You?
- Did you like it?

1490
01:35:19,459 --> 01:35:21,450
Did you poison it?

1491
01:35:22,295 --> 01:35:25,059
Uncle, why don't you
say something nice?

1492
01:35:25,131 --> 01:35:28,623
Mother was saying she has
become brazen living with you.

1493
01:35:29,202 --> 01:35:30,294
Eat it.

1494
01:35:37,077 --> 01:35:38,066
It's nice.

1495
01:35:38,144 --> 01:35:39,475
So am i

1496
01:35:40,980 --> 01:35:42,072
chaudhary.

1497
01:35:42,315 --> 01:35:47,947
Look, today i have
brought in foreign trade.

1498
01:35:48,021 --> 01:35:50,512
Jatta, that's really amazing.

1499
01:35:55,562 --> 01:35:56,927
What are you doing?

1500
01:35:59,065 --> 01:36:00,157
Quiet.

1501
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:03,298
He's speaking a
different kind of english.

1502
01:36:03,369 --> 01:36:06,065
Guest is god.

1503
01:36:06,139 --> 01:36:08,107
What are you blabbering?

1504
01:36:29,329 --> 01:36:30,694
What are you doing?

1505
01:36:30,930 --> 01:36:32,454
He's a guest of our country.

1506
01:36:32,532 --> 01:36:35,160
He's here to see the
beauty of our country.

1507
01:36:35,235 --> 01:36:37,135
Will people come here
from foreign countries...

1508
01:36:37,203 --> 01:36:39,137
...it helps our country progress.

1509
01:36:39,205 --> 01:36:40,399
They bring more business.

1510
01:36:40,473 --> 01:36:41,565
That's why.

1511
01:36:41,641 --> 01:36:43,632
That's why we abducted him.

1512
01:36:44,544 --> 01:36:46,478
He's a poor man.

1513
01:36:46,980 --> 01:36:48,504
He doesn't have any money.

1514
01:36:48,581 --> 01:36:50,412
A foreigner without money.

1515
01:36:50,483 --> 01:36:52,246
What are you saying?

1516
01:36:52,452 --> 01:36:55,353
Not every foreigner is rich.

1517
01:36:55,522 --> 01:36:57,251
He's a postman in his country.

1518
01:36:57,357 --> 01:36:59,222
He works hard for six months...

1519
01:36:59,292 --> 01:37:01,590
...and the remaining months
he travels around the world.

1520
01:37:01,961 --> 01:37:03,155
What do you want?

1521
01:37:03,229 --> 01:37:05,163
That, when he travels
to other countries...

1522
01:37:05,265 --> 01:37:07,165
...he defames our country.

1523
01:37:07,233 --> 01:37:09,098
He defames chaudhary.

1524
01:37:11,070 --> 01:37:13,197
Sorry, uncle, for taking your name.

1525
01:37:16,276 --> 01:37:18,540
You two go and set him free.

1526
01:37:18,611 --> 01:37:20,909
Chaudhary, what is she saying?

1527
01:37:21,080 --> 01:37:22,911
She is absolutely right.

1528
01:37:23,149 --> 01:37:25,174
Go and take our guest back...

1529
01:37:25,251 --> 01:37:26,377
...to from wherever
you brought him from.

1530
01:37:26,419 --> 01:37:29,149
Chaudhary, we'll have to go
to laddak to take him back.

1531
01:37:29,222 --> 01:37:33,056
Listen, show him simla on the way.

1532
01:37:33,126 --> 01:37:35,253
Otherwise i will slap you.

1533
01:37:48,474 --> 01:37:50,942
What are you saying?

1534
01:37:51,177 --> 01:37:53,338
My aunt died years ago.

1535
01:37:53,413 --> 01:37:55,142
How will i bring her back now?

1536
01:37:56,049 --> 01:37:58,108
Now, you are free.

1537
01:37:58,351 --> 01:38:00,114
Go and see india.

1538
01:38:01,421 --> 01:38:03,616
You free.

1539
01:38:05,425 --> 01:38:07,188
Take him back.

1540
01:38:25,578 --> 01:38:26,909
Jatta.

1541
01:38:27,914 --> 01:38:29,643
She cooks food well.

1542
01:38:30,483 --> 01:38:32,644
She speaks the new
kind of english as well.

1543
01:38:33,620 --> 01:38:35,679
Demand for 500,000 more.

1544
01:38:39,993 --> 01:38:42,223
Happy birthday to you.

1545
01:38:42,295 --> 01:38:44,490
Happy birthday to you.

1546
01:38:44,597 --> 01:38:47,065
Happy birthday dear chaudhary.

1547
01:38:47,133 --> 01:38:49,601
Happy birthday to you.

1548
01:38:50,403 --> 01:38:51,927
Happy birthday to you.

1549
01:38:52,005 --> 01:38:53,438
You were born in a zoo.

1550
01:38:53,539 --> 01:38:55,234
With the monkeys and donkeys.

1551
01:38:55,275 --> 01:38:57,072
And we have a friend like you.

1552
01:38:58,011 --> 01:38:59,945
What is she singing?

1553
01:39:02,916 --> 01:39:04,577
Father... she must be praising you.

1554
01:39:05,885 --> 01:39:07,045
So?

1555
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:09,351
I...

1556
01:39:09,422 --> 01:39:10,946
i will go see the decorations.

1557
01:39:11,291 --> 01:39:12,280
Wait, wait, wait.

1558
01:39:12,392 --> 01:39:13,416
I will come along as well.

1559
01:39:13,626 --> 01:39:15,321
Sister-in-law, i am coming too.

1560
01:39:15,495 --> 01:39:16,621
Sister-in-law?

1561
01:39:17,664 --> 01:39:19,063
What is going on here?

1562
01:39:19,399 --> 01:39:21,629
Where is the entire
family running off to?

1563
01:39:32,312 --> 01:39:33,540
Sweet.

1564
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:36,412
Father, cakes are normally sweet.

1565
01:39:36,482 --> 01:39:39,007
Not the cake, you dimwit.

1566
01:39:39,385 --> 01:39:41,615
The girl's sweet.

1567
01:39:42,922 --> 01:39:44,150
That she is.

1568
01:39:48,494 --> 01:39:50,428
She's intelligent as well.

1569
01:39:51,197 --> 01:39:53,427
She speaks different
kind of english as well.

1570
01:39:54,200 --> 01:39:55,963
She cooks well too.

1571
01:39:56,402 --> 01:39:57,528
Cooking.

1572
01:39:58,204 --> 01:39:59,899
Marry her.

1573
01:40:06,312 --> 01:40:08,371
You don't look after my business.

1574
01:40:08,948 --> 01:40:12,645
I feel she will manage my
business after i pass away.

1575
01:40:20,626 --> 01:40:21,957
That's why.

1576
01:40:22,662 --> 01:40:25,426
That's why i can't marry
her even though i want to.

1577
01:40:27,467 --> 01:40:30,061
I don't want to thrive
on such a living, father.

1578
01:40:31,204 --> 01:40:37,109
Stop looking for
benefits in everyone, father.

1579
01:40:45,284 --> 01:40:46,478
Dhani.

1580
01:40:47,353 --> 01:40:48,513
Try the kebabs.

1581
01:40:48,588 --> 01:40:49,680
They are delicious.

1582
01:40:49,989 --> 01:40:51,513
No, sister-in-law.
I am vegetable today.

1583
01:40:52,558 --> 01:40:54,617
It's vegetarian.

1584
01:40:55,428 --> 01:40:57,623
Sister-in-law,
sometimes you speak rubbish.

1585
01:40:57,897 --> 01:41:00,229
Come quickly, the show's
about to start. - Yes, come on.

1586
01:41:00,533 --> 01:41:01,932
Where are you going?

1587
01:41:02,101 --> 01:41:03,295
The women from our family...

1588
01:41:03,369 --> 01:41:05,269
...don't take part in such programs.

1589
01:41:05,972 --> 01:41:07,633
We'll watch from above. Come on.

1590
01:41:07,907 --> 01:41:08,931
Come on.

1591
01:41:09,342 --> 01:41:15,076
"The wife looks young
only until 20 or 30."

1592
01:41:15,581 --> 01:41:21,577
"And an ox lives for 9 years."

1593
01:41:22,155 --> 01:41:24,487
"A man and horse..."

1594
01:41:24,590 --> 01:41:31,359
"a man and horse never grows old."

1595
01:41:31,531 --> 01:41:37,197
"If they keep getting fresh stuff."

1596
01:41:43,209 --> 01:41:45,677
"That chewing that you chew."

1597
01:41:46,179 --> 01:41:49,012
"You rule the kingdom of my heart."

1598
01:41:49,282 --> 01:41:52,251
"That goggle that you wear."

1599
01:41:52,318 --> 01:41:54,980
"You look really attractive."

1600
01:41:55,021 --> 01:41:57,990
"The entire world's..."

1601
01:41:58,057 --> 01:42:01,117
"the entire world's..."

1602
01:42:01,194 --> 01:42:05,858
"the entire world's my fan."

1603
01:42:07,233 --> 01:42:10,327
"I've become your fan."

1604
01:42:10,403 --> 01:42:13,167
"I've become your fan."

1605
01:42:13,439 --> 01:42:16,408
"I've become your fan, sweetheart."

1606
01:42:16,476 --> 01:42:20,640
"I've become your fan."

1607
01:42:20,913 --> 01:42:22,312
"How did you fall for me?"

1608
01:42:22,381 --> 01:42:23,245
"Just tell me that."

1609
01:42:23,282 --> 01:42:26,376
"I think the girl's crazy."

1610
01:42:26,452 --> 01:42:31,583
"The candle's turned into a lantern."

1611
01:42:32,024 --> 01:42:35,050
"I've become your fan."

1612
01:42:35,128 --> 01:42:37,460
"I've become your fan."

1613
01:42:38,164 --> 01:42:41,156
"I've become your fan, sweetheart."

1614
01:42:41,234 --> 01:42:45,568
"I've become your fan."

1615
01:42:57,416 --> 01:43:00,442
"My youth's at its brink."

1616
01:43:00,920 --> 01:43:03,889
"Everyone wants a taste of it."

1617
01:43:03,956 --> 01:43:06,584
"Anyone who has a taste of it."

1618
01:43:06,859 --> 01:43:09,623
"Loses his senses."

1619
01:43:09,896 --> 01:43:12,922
"Your beauty is one in a million."

1620
01:43:12,999 --> 01:43:16,025
"Boys are stunned to see your beauty."

1621
01:43:16,102 --> 01:43:19,071
"Your beauty is one in a million."

1622
01:43:19,138 --> 01:43:21,902
"Boys are stunned to see your beauty."

1623
01:43:21,941 --> 01:43:26,935
"This country liquor has
turned into champagne."

1624
01:43:27,313 --> 01:43:30,339
"I've become your fan."

1625
01:43:30,416 --> 01:43:33,078
"I've become your fan."

1626
01:43:33,486 --> 01:43:36,478
"I've become your fan, sweetheart."

1627
01:43:36,556 --> 01:43:39,616
"I've become your fan."

1628
01:44:01,247 --> 01:44:02,373
Play it.

1629
01:44:02,481 --> 01:44:05,314
Or do you want a tight slap?

1630
01:44:11,958 --> 01:44:17,919
"When you smile, your lips turn red."

1631
01:44:18,097 --> 01:44:24,036
"When you shy away,
it feels so sweet."

1632
01:44:24,103 --> 01:44:27,095
"The girl in green
dress is full of love."

1633
01:44:27,173 --> 01:44:30,233
"Look here, even i am full of life."

1634
01:44:30,276 --> 01:44:33,268
"The girl in green
dress is full of love."

1635
01:44:33,346 --> 01:44:36,144
"Look here, even i am full of life."

1636
01:44:36,215 --> 01:44:41,209
"She just turned from one to ten."

1637
01:44:43,155 --> 01:44:46,181
"I've become your fan."

1638
01:44:46,259 --> 01:44:48,625
"I've become your fan."

1639
01:44:49,295 --> 01:44:52,287
"I've become your fan, sweetheart."

1640
01:44:52,365 --> 01:44:54,959
"I've become your fan."

1641
01:44:55,401 --> 01:44:58,336
"I've become your fan."

1642
01:44:58,404 --> 01:45:03,103
"I've become your fan."

1643
01:45:39,879 --> 01:45:42,040
Are you the girl's father?

1644
01:45:42,114 --> 01:45:45,641
Oh no, mr.
Chaudhary. I am minni's papa.

1645
01:45:47,086 --> 01:45:49,611
What have you
thought about her future?

1646
01:45:50,222 --> 01:45:54,420
I had thought of getting my
daughter married with grandeur.

1647
01:45:56,529 --> 01:45:58,963
But now the situation is...

1648
01:45:59,198 --> 01:46:01,166
...that i will get her
married tomorrow itself...

1649
01:46:01,233 --> 01:46:03,428
...and send her to canada.

1650
01:46:05,538 --> 01:46:07,506
After that whatever i am left with...

1651
01:46:07,573 --> 01:46:09,973
i am not concerned about you.

1652
01:46:12,311 --> 01:46:15,041
Dhani, bring the girl here

1653
01:46:16,449 --> 01:46:19,316
mother, i don't want to go.

1654
01:46:19,618 --> 01:46:21,483
Please tell uncle.

1655
01:46:21,987 --> 01:46:24,547
I haven't even learnt to cook yet.

1656
01:46:27,693 --> 01:46:32,392
Look, dear. Your father
is here to take you back.

1657
01:46:32,465 --> 01:46:34,023
But i don't want to go.

1658
01:46:34,100 --> 01:46:35,692
You will have to go, dear.

1659
01:46:43,576 --> 01:46:45,043
Dhani.

1660
01:47:02,228 --> 01:47:03,388
Dhani.

1661
01:47:04,397 --> 01:47:06,661
Here. These are yours.

1662
01:47:08,033 --> 01:47:12,561
When we go to delhi
buy another pair for me.

1663
01:47:14,039 --> 01:47:17,338
But if i leave now how
will we both go to delhi?

1664
01:47:17,910 --> 01:47:21,346
Tell uncle. I don't want to go.

1665
01:47:22,381 --> 01:47:23,609
Brother naidu.

1666
01:47:24,450 --> 01:47:26,941
You're fighting for
women's equality, aren't you?

1667
01:47:27,319 --> 01:47:31,050
If i leave then how will
you get my valuable vote?

1668
01:47:32,358 --> 01:47:34,326
Don't send me back, please.

1669
01:47:35,494 --> 01:47:37,621
Please, brother naidu. Please.

1670
01:47:38,998 --> 01:47:41,990
Will you do as i say?

1671
01:47:44,336 --> 01:47:46,668
Your father is your well-wisher.

1672
01:47:48,507 --> 01:47:50,407
You will have to go.

1673
01:47:52,344 --> 01:47:53,971
All the very best.

1674
01:48:17,570 --> 01:48:22,132
I've always seen people happy
when they're released from here.

1675
01:48:24,210 --> 01:48:26,644
You're the first one who is sad.

1676
01:48:27,980 --> 01:48:30,107
Won't you go back home, dear?

1677
01:48:37,122 --> 01:48:39,420
Mini. What are you doing there?

1678
01:48:39,558 --> 01:48:40,684
Come here.

1679
01:48:41,060 --> 01:48:42,618
Have you lost your mind?

1680
01:48:43,095 --> 01:48:45,689
Lower your voice.

1681
01:48:46,499 --> 01:48:48,490
What are you doing here? Come here.

1682
01:48:53,939 --> 01:48:55,531
Will you marry my chotu?

1683
01:49:23,469 --> 01:49:25,664
Do you see everyone's sad faces?

1684
01:49:37,049 --> 01:49:39,916
They all know that she
doesn't want to leave.

1685
01:49:44,957 --> 01:49:47,517
All you have to do is say "yes"...

1686
01:49:48,360 --> 01:49:50,089
...and everyone will be happy again.

1687
01:49:50,563 --> 01:49:52,895
Then no one can take
her away from here.

1688
01:49:53,065 --> 01:49:55,090
Just say no.

1689
01:50:13,218 --> 01:50:14,344
No, father.

1690
01:50:25,664 --> 01:50:26,995
Let her go.

1691
01:50:39,111 --> 01:50:40,510
It's for her best.

1692
01:51:04,903 --> 01:51:05,631
How are you, dear?

1693
01:51:05,904 --> 01:51:07,166
Is everything fine?

1694
01:51:11,010 --> 01:51:12,944
Come on. Let's go home.

1695
01:51:14,046 --> 01:51:15,308
Dear.

1696
01:51:17,416 --> 01:51:20,044
Ask your father to take
the ransom money back.

1697
01:51:20,452 --> 01:51:22,511
And get you married with grandeur.

1698
01:51:26,625 --> 01:51:28,058
Come on.

1699
01:51:32,164 --> 01:51:34,325
What are you doing?

1700
01:51:43,942 --> 01:51:45,569
Mini.
- Please.

1701
01:51:53,619 --> 01:51:56,019
Your share of the money.

1702
01:51:58,290 --> 01:52:01,123
From today nothing exists between us.

1703
01:52:01,627 --> 01:52:04,528
Everything's finished, viren.

1704
01:52:30,355 --> 01:52:36,590
"Why has my heart decided to
let these distances crop up?"

1705
01:52:37,129 --> 01:52:39,393
What was that? What did you do?

1706
01:52:39,898 --> 01:52:41,331
Come on.

1707
01:52:43,368 --> 01:52:44,460
Just a minute.

1708
01:52:45,104 --> 01:52:46,332
I was forgetting this.

1709
01:52:46,405 --> 01:52:49,499
"It doesn't know how
it will survive..."

1710
01:52:49,575 --> 01:52:55,480
"...after parting ways with you."

1711
01:53:03,856 --> 01:53:06,882
Today you have made me
suffer the biggest loss ever.

1712
01:53:09,561 --> 01:53:11,995
This time it was more
emotional than financial.

1713
01:53:25,144 --> 01:53:27,942
"I am floored."

1714
01:53:28,280 --> 01:53:31,511
"I am floored."

1715
01:53:32,451 --> 01:53:37,889
"What is my fault?"

1716
01:53:38,090 --> 01:53:44,427
"All my wishes stayed unfulfilled."

1717
01:53:45,197 --> 01:53:50,601
"All my dreams were shattered."

1718
01:53:54,072 --> 01:53:56,404
"O beloved."

1719
01:53:56,475 --> 01:53:59,842
"O beloved."

1720
01:54:00,312 --> 01:54:06,114
"O beloved. O beloved."

1721
01:54:06,952 --> 01:54:09,216
"O beloved."

1722
01:54:09,254 --> 01:54:13,190
"O beloved."

1723
01:54:13,325 --> 01:54:18,422
"O beloved. O beloved."

1724
01:54:35,214 --> 01:54:36,442
Dhani.

1725
01:54:38,116 --> 01:54:41,051
Dhani... has mother woken up?

1726
01:54:41,386 --> 01:54:42,978
One has to sleep first to get up.

1727
01:54:43,622 --> 01:54:45,453
And no one has slept the entire night.

1728
01:54:46,625 --> 01:54:48,058
Move aside, i am busy.

1729
01:54:59,338 --> 01:55:00,498
Move aside.

1730
01:55:02,040 --> 01:55:03,337
Nonsense.

1731
01:55:06,612 --> 01:55:08,876
How are you feeling
after being released?

1732
01:55:10,382 --> 01:55:12,145
She must be feeling nice.

1733
01:55:12,951 --> 01:55:14,179
Ask one by one.

1734
01:55:14,253 --> 01:55:15,345
One question.
- Yes, you ask.

1735
01:55:15,420 --> 01:55:16,978
Your father is getting you married...

1736
01:55:17,055 --> 01:55:18,545
...as soon as you returned.

1737
01:55:18,590 --> 01:55:19,887
How do you feel?

1738
01:55:20,325 --> 01:55:21,417
"How are you feeling?"

1739
01:55:21,593 --> 01:55:22,560
Are you married?

1740
01:55:22,628 --> 01:55:23,560
How did you feel?

1741
01:55:23,629 --> 01:55:24,561
Nice, didn't you?

1742
01:55:24,630 --> 01:55:26,427
Similarly, she's feeling nice as well.

1743
01:55:26,498 --> 01:55:29,262
How did chaudhary treat you?

1744
01:55:29,334 --> 01:55:31,131
"How did they treat her?"

1745
01:55:31,637 --> 01:55:32,626
How did they treat her!

1746
01:55:32,905 --> 01:55:36,238
They were making her
dance when i reached there.

1747
01:55:36,441 --> 01:55:38,204
Strange...
- he's lying.

1748
01:55:38,243 --> 01:55:40,268
Mini, what are you saying?

1749
01:55:40,913 --> 01:55:44,371
They treated me like their daughter.
- Mini.

1750
01:55:45,150 --> 01:55:47,175
I stayed back willingly.

1751
01:55:48,287 --> 01:55:51,188
Dhani and brother naidu
looked after me really well.

1752
01:55:51,957 --> 01:55:53,117
And mother.

1753
01:55:54,660 --> 01:55:56,127
A mother is a mother after all.

1754
01:55:56,194 --> 01:55:58,389
So you saw. This is
chaudhary's terror.

1755
01:55:58,463 --> 01:56:01,557
Even after being released, people...

1756
01:56:05,404 --> 01:56:07,599
you should have stopped her, chotu.

1757
01:56:08,974 --> 01:56:11,442
Whatever happened wasn't right.

1758
01:56:25,657 --> 01:56:26,646
Mother.

1759
01:56:28,193 --> 01:56:29,251
Mother.

1760
01:56:30,128 --> 01:56:31,390
Mother.

1761
01:56:32,030 --> 01:56:33,088
Mother.

1762
01:56:37,936 --> 01:56:38,994
What is wrong with all of you?

1763
01:56:40,272 --> 01:56:41,364
What do you all think?

1764
01:56:41,940 --> 01:56:44,170
I am very happy
sending mini back home.

1765
01:56:47,112 --> 01:56:48,409
Do i look happy?

1766
01:56:48,714 --> 01:56:49,976
Do i?

1767
01:56:51,516 --> 01:56:52,608
And you.

1768
01:56:53,018 --> 01:56:54,315
You know everything, mother.

1769
01:56:54,419 --> 01:56:56,512
I left this house six years ago.

1770
01:56:57,255 --> 01:56:59,155
I never came back.

1771
01:56:59,658 --> 01:57:01,649
I don't want to
thrive on such a living.

1772
01:57:03,528 --> 01:57:05,291
I drive a rickshaw in the city.

1773
01:57:05,597 --> 01:57:08,191
I barely make my ends
meet but i am happy.

1774
01:57:13,338 --> 01:57:15,033
She's getting
married in a nice family.

1775
01:57:15,407 --> 01:57:17,034
So let her.

1776
01:57:18,910 --> 01:57:20,207
Mini will be happy.

1777
01:57:22,414 --> 01:57:23,904
I don't even have a place to live.

1778
01:57:23,982 --> 01:57:25,415
Where would i have taken her?

1779
01:57:26,485 --> 01:57:28,453
Why? Isn't this your house?

1780
01:57:29,087 --> 01:57:30,611
I would've looked
after her really well.

1781
01:57:30,689 --> 01:57:32,520
And turned her into a renegade.

1782
01:57:33,091 --> 01:57:34,524
Which house are you talking about?

1783
01:57:34,593 --> 01:57:35,525
This?

1784
01:57:35,594 --> 01:57:37,653
You are talking
about this 'agva house'.

1785
01:57:38,296 --> 01:57:43,495
Where there's a thief, a cheat and...
- raavan.

1786
01:57:49,574 --> 01:57:51,508
Isn't that what you want to say?

1787
01:57:52,644 --> 01:57:55,340
A raavan who abducts people.

1788
01:57:57,582 --> 01:58:00,210
You've given my introduction.

1789
01:58:00,619 --> 01:58:03,349
Now let me tell you about yourself.

1790
01:58:04,356 --> 01:58:06,119
You're a coward.

1791
01:58:10,062 --> 01:58:11,051
Listen.

1792
01:58:11,630 --> 01:58:15,327
The one you call thief,
isn't stealing...

1793
01:58:15,400 --> 01:58:17,163
that's called tricking.

1794
01:58:19,237 --> 01:58:20,568
There's a difference between the two.

1795
01:58:22,441 --> 01:58:24,671
Do you know what she wants to be?

1796
01:58:25,243 --> 01:58:27,040
She wants to be a magician.

1797
01:58:27,412 --> 01:58:29,471
And if you think what
she's doing is wrong...

1798
01:58:29,548 --> 01:58:31,982
...then why didn't you fulfill
the responsibility of a brother.

1799
01:58:32,984 --> 01:58:35,350
You should've showed
her the right path.

1800
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:37,010
But you ran away.

1801
01:58:38,990 --> 01:58:40,548
And the one who runs away
from his responsibilities...

1802
01:58:40,625 --> 01:58:43,150
...people call him a coward.

1803
01:58:45,530 --> 01:58:48,192
With what right do
you call naidu a cheat?

1804
01:58:49,401 --> 01:58:50,493
You fool.

1805
01:58:50,569 --> 01:58:52,298
All ministers aren't corrupt.

1806
01:58:52,370 --> 01:58:54,065
The youngsters from
neighboring states...

1807
01:58:54,139 --> 01:58:56,232
...roam around jobless and inebriated.

1808
01:58:56,308 --> 01:58:57,434
And the youngsters of hariyana.

1809
01:58:57,509 --> 01:58:58,908
Best in sports.

1810
01:58:58,977 --> 01:59:00,001
Best in relay.

1811
01:59:00,078 --> 01:59:01,067
Best in boxing.

1812
01:59:01,146 --> 01:59:03,011
Best in wrestling. Best in 'kabaddi'.

1813
01:59:03,615 --> 01:59:05,207
And who is responsible for it?

1814
01:59:05,517 --> 01:59:08,179
Naidu and ministers like naidu.

1815
01:59:08,386 --> 01:59:10,877
How do you call him a cheat?

1816
01:59:15,494 --> 01:59:17,894
I admit they're not your kin.

1817
01:59:18,630 --> 01:59:21,064
That's why you don't love them.

1818
01:59:23,535 --> 01:59:26,231
Father...
- but i am your father.

1819
01:59:26,605 --> 01:59:28,539
You're my blood.

1820
01:59:29,307 --> 01:59:32,003
You've a problem with my earning.

1821
01:59:32,511 --> 01:59:33,944
And when you were younger...

1822
01:59:34,112 --> 01:59:37,047
...you would fly paper airplanes...

1823
01:59:37,482 --> 01:59:39,382
...cruise around on the
motorcycle with the same money.

1824
01:59:39,551 --> 01:59:42,543
Then you would sing praises
like "my father's the best".

1825
01:59:43,989 --> 01:59:46,082
And when you grew up...

1826
01:59:46,158 --> 01:59:48,956
...you had a problem with my earning.

1827
01:59:49,461 --> 01:59:50,951
Why didn't you say then...

1828
01:59:51,229 --> 01:59:54,198
..."look, father. Your
son's grown up now".

1829
01:59:54,566 --> 01:59:57,126
"We will work hard, we'll
have one square meal a day...

1830
01:59:57,202 --> 01:59:58,863
...but lead a life of dignity."

1831
01:59:59,471 --> 02:00:02,065
When it was time to
fulfill your duty as a son...

1832
02:00:02,140 --> 02:00:03,607
...you ran away.

1833
02:00:04,876 --> 02:00:06,867
Anyone who runs away from
his responsibility as a son...

1834
02:00:06,945 --> 02:00:09,505
...is called a coward.

1835
02:00:12,584 --> 02:00:14,484
And this time the
biggest responsibility...

1836
02:00:14,519 --> 02:00:17,955
...that you ran away from is
the responsibility of love.

1837
02:00:19,057 --> 02:00:20,991
That girl fell in love with you.

1838
02:00:21,593 --> 02:00:23,083
That responsibility.

1839
02:00:23,662 --> 02:00:25,152
Who do you think you are?

1840
02:00:25,897 --> 02:00:27,592
You don't look like salman khan.

1841
02:00:28,533 --> 02:00:31,400
Nor are you rich as the
tata's or the ambani's.

1842
02:00:31,603 --> 02:00:34,128
Still that girl wants to marry you.

1843
02:00:35,273 --> 02:00:38,367
And the one who runs from the
responsibility of marriage...

1844
02:00:38,443 --> 02:00:40,411
what is the time, father?
- What?

1845
02:00:40,478 --> 02:00:41,570
What is the time?

1846
02:00:42,914 --> 02:00:44,142
2:15.

1847
02:00:44,216 --> 02:00:45,911
Where are you running off to?

1848
02:00:46,918 --> 02:00:48,681
I am going to fulfill my
responsibility, father.

1849
02:00:48,920 --> 02:00:50,182
What do you mean?

1850
02:00:50,322 --> 02:00:52,984
Your blood will show its true
color for the first and last time.

1851
02:00:53,058 --> 02:00:54,491
What are you going to do?

1852
02:00:54,893 --> 02:00:56,451
To abduct her.

1853
02:01:03,335 --> 02:01:04,495
Jatta.

1854
02:01:05,170 --> 02:01:06,330
Get the car.

1855
02:01:09,507 --> 02:01:10,531
Father.

1856
02:01:10,909 --> 02:01:14,003
We will work hard, have
one square meal a day...

1857
02:01:14,145 --> 02:01:15,407
...but lead a life of dignity.

1858
02:01:15,614 --> 02:01:17,104
That's more like it.

1859
02:01:20,552 --> 02:01:22,884
Did i say too much?

1860
02:02:02,360 --> 02:02:06,023
"I am floored."

1861
02:02:06,331 --> 02:02:08,993
"I am floored."

1862
02:02:25,150 --> 02:02:28,176
Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

1863
02:02:28,253 --> 02:02:29,515
Great.

1864
02:02:40,498 --> 02:02:45,526
"I am floored."

1865
02:02:52,544 --> 02:02:54,205
Come, dear.

1866
02:02:59,351 --> 02:03:00,545
Hold this, dear.

1867
02:03:22,407 --> 02:03:26,309
"I am floored."

1868
02:03:52,103 --> 02:03:54,936
The boy will now adorn the
'mangalsutra' to the girl.

1869
02:04:12,257 --> 02:04:15,226
Now the boy will grace the
girl's forehead with vermillion.

1870
02:04:27,105 --> 02:04:29,596
"O beloved."

1871
02:04:29,874 --> 02:04:34,106
"O beloved."

1872
02:04:44,422 --> 02:04:46,583
So, son. Got your green card.

1873
02:04:47,158 --> 02:04:49,023
Straight to canada.

1874
02:04:49,160 --> 02:04:50,320
Get the car.

1875
02:04:52,597 --> 02:04:55,191
I will miss your mischiefs.

1876
02:04:55,533 --> 02:04:57,558
Look after yourself.

1877
02:04:58,570 --> 02:05:00,265
Come. Come on.

1878
02:05:01,506 --> 02:05:03,531
Sir, one group photo.

1879
02:05:04,309 --> 02:05:05,367
Yes.
- Come on.

1880
02:05:05,443 --> 02:05:06,569
Sir, smile.

1881
02:05:16,154 --> 02:05:17,246
Very nice, sir.

1882
02:05:17,856 --> 02:05:19,221
Smile, sir.

1883
02:05:36,975 --> 02:05:39,034
Viren.
- Sparkling...

1884
02:05:39,110 --> 02:05:40,338
what are you doing in the car?

1885
02:05:41,012 --> 02:05:42,980
Sparkling...
- you're here?

1886
02:05:43,047 --> 02:05:44,514
Sparkling...
- you're here.

1887
02:05:45,016 --> 02:05:46,574
That means you took the
nuptial rounds. - Sparkling...

1888
02:05:46,651 --> 02:05:47,982
then where's sunny?

1889
02:05:48,419 --> 02:05:49,511
Mini.

1890
02:05:50,622 --> 02:05:52,317
Can i speak now?
- Yes.

1891
02:05:52,490 --> 02:05:54,151
I came on a sparkling horse.

1892
02:05:54,459 --> 02:05:56,484
I am taking you away in
car decorated with flowers.

1893
02:06:09,340 --> 02:06:10,568
This is what you wanted, isn't it?

1894
02:06:13,077 --> 02:06:15,170
Chotu.

1895
02:06:15,513 --> 02:06:17,413
Open the door.

1896
02:06:19,117 --> 02:06:20,482
First dance for me.

1897
02:06:20,585 --> 02:06:23,019
Stop it, open the door...

1898
02:06:23,288 --> 02:06:24,550
first dance for me.

1899
02:06:32,664 --> 02:06:34,131
Thank god.

1900
02:06:34,399 --> 02:06:36,128
She's leaving happily.

1901
02:06:36,200 --> 02:06:37,258
It's the grace of god.

1902
02:06:37,368 --> 02:06:38,357
No, no, not this one.

1903
02:06:38,403 --> 02:06:39,392
Come on, open the door.

1904
02:06:39,504 --> 02:06:40,630
Do the michael jackson step.

1905
02:06:41,039 --> 02:06:42,199
No.
- Yes.

1906
02:06:43,374 --> 02:06:44,568
I will sing as well.

1907
02:06:51,416 --> 02:06:53,179
Hurry.

1908
02:06:53,251 --> 02:06:55,185
Come on, come on.
- Come on, hurry up.

1909
02:06:58,389 --> 02:06:59,515
Why are you hitting me?

1910
02:06:59,591 --> 02:07:01,388
Because you made me cry a lot.

1911
02:07:01,559 --> 02:07:04,027
Actually, after you left...
- yes.

1912
02:07:04,095 --> 02:07:05,357
I thought a lot.

1913
02:07:05,897 --> 02:07:07,228
What will i say to you?

1914
02:07:07,298 --> 02:07:09,528
How will i live without you?

1915
02:07:09,934 --> 02:07:11,401
Viren, don't bore me.

1916
02:07:11,536 --> 02:07:13,436
We're married, and now
you're proposing me.

1917
02:07:13,638 --> 02:07:15,105
I love you.

1918
02:07:17,208 --> 02:07:20,507
Chotu, now you are kidnapping me.

1919
02:07:20,678 --> 02:07:22,976
You always said i don't have that.

1920
02:07:23,214 --> 02:07:25,079
That?
- Yes, that.

1921
02:07:25,283 --> 02:07:26,944
What's that?

1922
02:07:27,518 --> 02:07:28,644
Adventure.

1923
02:07:30,121 --> 02:07:31,315
Chandra chur.

1924
02:07:32,690 --> 02:07:34,487
Shall we go?
- Where?

1925
02:07:35,059 --> 02:07:36,458
'Agva house.'

1926
02:07:37,061 --> 02:07:40,360
Hurry up, or do you want a slap?

1927
02:07:48,206 --> 02:07:50,299
They are very mischievous.

1928
02:07:50,942 --> 02:07:52,409
They took the car.

1929
02:07:52,477 --> 02:07:54,342
After all, whose children are they?
