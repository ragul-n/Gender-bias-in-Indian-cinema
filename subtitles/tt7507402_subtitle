1
00:01:04,467 --> 00:01:05,509
This is not a joke.

2
00:01:08,009 --> 00:01:11,300
Everyone at my Nursing
Home wants to know.

3
00:01:13,259 --> 00:01:15,176
This is highly insulting.

4
00:01:17,342 --> 00:01:20,967
What could have possibly
happened in my absence?

5
00:01:22,675 --> 00:01:24,134
I can't take it anymore.

6
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,592
What do you mean?
- What are you doing?

7
00:01:29,675 --> 00:01:30,759
What's wrong with you?

8
00:01:31,051 --> 00:01:32,884
Everything is settled.
Why are you turning back?

9
00:01:33,634 --> 00:01:34,383
Look at me.

10
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:37,884
You're not at your flat in
Bhowanipore & your phone is off.

11
00:01:37,967 --> 00:01:40,592
Can't understand what's happening!
- Anjan! That hurts!

12
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,967
Where have you shifted to?

13
00:01:43,884 --> 00:01:44,884
What's wrong with you?

14
00:01:45,467 --> 00:01:47,717
Why are you trying to avoid.
- I don't like it anymore.

15
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:51,176
You don't like me?

16
00:01:53,967 --> 00:01:55,926
Are you involved
with somebody else?

17
00:02:15,842 --> 00:02:18,092
Dear Dr.Banerjee,
this is to inform you...

18
00:02:18,218 --> 00:02:21,509
That I will be unable to
continue with my duties...

19
00:02:21,717 --> 00:02:24,425
At the nursing home in future.

20
00:02:24,592 --> 00:02:28,342
Please treat this as my resignation
and release me of my duties.

21
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,383
Thank you and Regards.

22
00:02:32,675 --> 00:02:33,675
You are insane!

23
00:02:47,259 --> 00:02:48,759
Wait! Hold up!

24
00:02:50,467 --> 00:02:53,342
This is the stop for Jhaopota!

25
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:59,759
Mam, this is your stop.

26
00:03:01,842 --> 00:03:03,051
Time to get off.

27
00:03:03,634 --> 00:03:04,634
The fare is 40 rupees.

28
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,550
Let's move!

29
00:03:15,134 --> 00:03:16,342
Go! Go! Go!

30
00:03:30,717 --> 00:03:31,717
Come along.

31
00:03:35,467 --> 00:03:38,134
Why so late?
- The usual.

32
00:03:38,634 --> 00:03:39,634
Let's go.

33
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,842
Have you noticed how
gorgeous Kolkata looks at times.

34
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:46,342
A lot like your face
after a nice cuddle.

35
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,425
Day off?
- Why the question?

36
00:04:00,717 --> 00:04:02,759
Your trying to wiggle
your way to the point.

37
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:04,509
You got me!

38
00:04:05,092 --> 00:04:08,009
Your face looks like it's been
stuck in a Kolkata traffic jam...

39
00:04:08,467 --> 00:04:10,218
When you haven't been cuddled.

40
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:14,300
Having a psychiatrist as a
girlfriend is a huge problem.

41
00:04:33,425 --> 00:04:34,425
Experience?

42
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:35,759
Geriatric behavior.

43
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,009
Specialisation in
mood disorders.

44
00:04:39,176 --> 00:04:39,634
I mean...

45
00:04:39,717 --> 00:04:43,509
I was the MD at Alberta
Hospital at Edmonton, in Canada.

46
00:04:43,634 --> 00:04:46,592
I know all about geriatric behavior,
Reminiscence Theory and...

47
00:04:46,634 --> 00:04:48,342
Everything related to that.

48
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:49,967
Why the sacrifice?

49
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:52,383
More of a desire.

50
00:04:52,467 --> 00:04:54,967
Only criminals desire sacrifice
and I hope you're not one.

51
00:04:55,176 --> 00:04:56,176
Addiction?

52
00:04:57,051 --> 00:04:58,051
Smoking.

53
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:01,634
How many a day?

54
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:05,259
Depends.

55
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:06,759
You have to quit.

56
00:05:07,383 --> 00:05:08,383
No.

57
00:05:11,926 --> 00:05:14,425
This is a personal
decision so...

58
00:05:14,467 --> 00:05:17,425
All execution and
decisions here are mine.

59
00:05:17,467 --> 00:05:18,259
Nothing is personal.

60
00:05:18,509 --> 00:05:20,300
If you can deal
with it, then stay.

61
00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:24,383
Dr.Sen, we won't
tolerate any excesses.

62
00:05:25,467 --> 00:05:26,467
Remember that.

63
00:05:28,675 --> 00:05:30,509
Is this the way
I'll treat everyone?

64
00:05:30,926 --> 00:05:35,967
I mean the way,
you are treating me…

65
00:05:37,717 --> 00:05:39,717
If you don't like
it, you can leave.

66
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,675
Tomorrow morning itself.

67
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,550
No, I won't leave.

68
00:05:46,675 --> 00:05:49,134
I appreciate your decision
but please wait outside for now.

69
00:05:58,717 --> 00:05:59,717
Ow!

70
00:06:06,884 --> 00:06:08,884
Did you get hit?

71
00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:10,509
What if I did?

72
00:06:17,051 --> 00:06:18,383
Who are you?

73
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:21,592
I am...
- What's the matter, Abhi?

74
00:06:22,342 --> 00:06:24,259
Didn't I tell you
to stay inside?

75
00:06:26,134 --> 00:06:29,051
Do you understand
what I say or not?

76
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,134
What is that?

77
00:06:31,218 --> 00:06:32,592
Have you taken the gun again?

78
00:06:32,842 --> 00:06:33,842
Give it to me!

79
00:06:34,092 --> 00:06:35,092
Come here.

80
00:06:35,675 --> 00:06:37,134
Abhi, Come here.

81
00:06:38,509 --> 00:06:42,051
Dr. Sinha it's not his fault.

82
00:06:42,218 --> 00:06:44,259
Let him go. Abhi, come here.

83
00:06:44,884 --> 00:06:47,051
Give me the gun. Abhi!

84
00:06:48,218 --> 00:06:49,509
Let go off him!

85
00:06:50,342 --> 00:06:51,342
No!

86
00:06:55,884 --> 00:06:57,051
You are mad!

87
00:06:57,342 --> 00:06:59,926
You do everything on purpose!

88
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:03,134
You will never grow a brain!

89
00:07:03,509 --> 00:07:04,634
Why do you stay?

90
00:07:04,717 --> 00:07:06,884
Why don't you leave?

91
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:11,259
After destroying my entire life,
you still leave me no escape!

92
00:07:12,092 --> 00:07:15,592
And still none of you say anything.
- Hey!

93
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,675
Don't you try and
get them on your side.

94
00:07:17,717 --> 00:07:21,467
The things you do are barbaric!

95
00:07:21,592 --> 00:07:23,051
I have dignity!

96
00:07:23,134 --> 00:07:24,634
I am not like you!

97
00:07:24,884 --> 00:07:27,051
I can't take this shouting!

98
00:07:27,383 --> 00:07:28,967
Keep quiet. She's
having a problem.

99
00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:31,259
Who is she? My boss?

100
00:07:31,634 --> 00:07:33,800
Should I tell her what you do?

101
00:07:33,926 --> 00:07:35,550
When are you going to go?

102
00:07:35,592 --> 00:07:37,342
If I go for good, I'll
take you with me!

103
00:07:37,717 --> 00:07:42,176
You loved your
son like anything...

104
00:07:42,467 --> 00:07:44,884
And they left you
& went to Australia.

105
00:07:44,967 --> 00:07:47,884
Hearing aid! Need
my hearing aid!

106
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:48,842
The fight has started.

107
00:07:48,884 --> 00:07:50,218
Straight to your room, Grandpa.

108
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,717
I don't need it later.

109
00:07:52,842 --> 00:07:54,259
I need it now. Not late!

110
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,550
Straight to the room
for physiotherapy.

111
00:07:56,634 --> 00:07:59,884
Don't touch me! You
smell like a buffalo.

112
00:07:59,926 --> 00:08:01,342
You will sleep alone tonight.

113
00:08:01,383 --> 00:08:04,509
I will throw you off
the bed, you hag!

114
00:08:04,634 --> 00:08:06,467
Old man! Shut up!

115
00:08:06,634 --> 00:08:09,259
Our sons left because
of you! Only you!

116
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,176
Good morning.

117
00:08:14,634 --> 00:08:15,967
Who is this chick?

118
00:08:17,592 --> 00:08:20,134
Let me introduce you to
Dr.Paromita Sen, psychiatrist.

119
00:08:20,218 --> 00:08:22,218
She is your new supervisor.

120
00:08:25,342 --> 00:08:28,342
If anyone has a problem
please speak to her.

121
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:29,842
She's the 5th one.

122
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:30,884
Ok?

123
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,592
I'll tell Samita to show
you to the quarters.

124
00:08:35,717 --> 00:08:36,467
Ok.

125
00:08:41,134 --> 00:08:43,800
Good morning
everybody, I'm Paromita.

126
00:08:44,176 --> 00:08:46,259
Let's have a lovely
time together.

127
00:08:59,425 --> 00:09:00,967
No need to wait anymore.

128
00:09:01,176 --> 00:09:03,967
Let's go!

129
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:15,634
Let's go…

130
00:09:22,134 --> 00:09:23,134
What's wrong?

131
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:26,550
Are you feeling uncomfortable?

132
00:09:26,675 --> 00:09:27,926
You can tell me.

133
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:30,509
Tell me.

134
00:09:39,634 --> 00:09:45,176
Trust me, everyone of
them is a piece of work.

135
00:09:45,467 --> 00:09:48,342
They have wives, sons,
granddaughters, the works…

136
00:09:48,717 --> 00:09:50,509
But they've just
left them behind.

137
00:09:51,342 --> 00:09:55,842
Dipankar, he's 85 and
has heart problems...

138
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,134
But he just won't
take physiotherapy.

139
00:09:58,509 --> 00:10:02,884
And Banerjee Dida will take
her make up pouch to the grave.

140
00:10:03,467 --> 00:10:05,218
And Shankar...

141
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:09,634
Does Dr.Sinha run
this place by himself?

142
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:12,926
His wife...
- Left a long time ago.

143
00:10:13,009 --> 00:10:18,592
She left when
Abhimanyu was 3 or 4.

144
00:10:18,967 --> 00:10:21,218
Who can stay with that beast?

145
00:10:22,092 --> 00:10:23,092
Tea.

146
00:10:50,009 --> 00:10:56,884
Ten years, since your last
film, last public appearance.

147
00:11:03,467 --> 00:11:07,550
Every year features on
you on your birthday...

148
00:11:07,675 --> 00:11:10,675
Discussions on
your cinemas on tv...

149
00:11:14,717 --> 00:11:16,759
I just can't believe.

150
00:11:18,634 --> 00:11:22,634
We thought you lived
in your flat in Ballygunge.

151
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,967
You don't meet anyone..
So many rumours…

152
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,675
But you are here.

153
00:11:29,342 --> 00:11:32,300
If only the press
got the wind of it….

154
00:11:50,425 --> 00:11:53,550
Different people live
in different worlds.

155
00:11:54,509 --> 00:11:57,134
For some its smooth,
For others square...

156
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:01,092
Undulating or fragmented….

157
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:04,218
Like a formless
painting of Picasso!

158
00:12:06,884 --> 00:12:08,342
What do people want?

159
00:12:09,842 --> 00:12:14,383
Success, freedom or lust?

160
00:12:16,634 --> 00:12:18,009
What?

161
00:12:18,467 --> 00:12:21,092
What is it Apu? What
do you want to say?

162
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:23,218
Don't just sit there silently.

163
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:35,759
What's that for?

164
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,092
I love you Paromitadi.

165
00:12:43,675 --> 00:12:46,342
I am madly in love with you.

166
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:51,218
I've tried to fight it but...

167
00:12:59,051 --> 00:13:04,300
I have told nothing about your
recent activities to Anjanda.

168
00:13:14,467 --> 00:13:17,051
I…Please don't go away, don't…

169
00:13:18,134 --> 00:13:21,092
Just tell Anjanda the truth.

170
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:26,425
What rubbish are
you talking Apu.

171
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:33,134
My decision of not
marrying Anjan is personal.

172
00:13:33,675 --> 00:13:35,759
Your feelings for
me is infatuation.

173
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:46,675
You will remain the
same for me always.

174
00:13:52,509 --> 00:13:53,509
Apu…

175
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,092
Do you have any film
magazine with you?

176
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:05,759
They don't keep any here.

177
00:14:05,926 --> 00:14:07,218
Come in, please.

178
00:14:07,592 --> 00:14:10,092
May I?
- Sure, come in.

179
00:14:14,134 --> 00:14:15,550
Sit.

180
00:14:16,176 --> 00:14:17,675
Thank you.

181
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,509
You like films?

182
00:14:23,634 --> 00:14:25,759
What do you think of me?

183
00:14:27,092 --> 00:14:30,092
It seems you are fond of films.
- Correct.

184
00:14:30,926 --> 00:14:33,425
Shakti Samanta
had offered me a role.

185
00:14:34,509 --> 00:14:36,717
Guess opposite whom?

186
00:14:37,218 --> 00:14:45,425
Kaka… Rajesh Khanna!
I was just sixteen.

187
00:14:46,842 --> 00:14:51,259
Right, the moment I saw
you I felt you were a filmstar.

188
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:53,092
Really?

189
00:14:53,842 --> 00:14:54,967
Ofcourse!

190
00:14:56,425 --> 00:14:59,592
But why didn't you
take on the offer?

191
00:14:59,884 --> 00:15:02,717
I mean when a director
like Shakti Samanta...

192
00:15:02,884 --> 00:15:04,092
Just a minute do you
want some hot grams?

193
00:15:04,218 --> 00:15:05,218
Hot grams?

194
00:15:05,425 --> 00:15:10,509
No, if I fall sick? It's
not encouraged here.

195
00:15:10,592 --> 00:15:14,467
Who says you'll fall
sick? Come on try some.

196
00:15:19,092 --> 00:15:20,425
I could not take up the offer.

197
00:15:21,383 --> 00:15:26,176
The moment my father heard of
it he got hold of his friend's son...

198
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,800
And got me married off.

199
00:15:29,218 --> 00:15:36,176
They were from north Kolkata,
owners of four cinema halls.

200
00:15:37,259 --> 00:15:39,092
No aesthetic sense.

201
00:15:39,592 --> 00:15:43,300
Knew only how to number
tickets and to count money.

202
00:15:43,926 --> 00:15:48,009
He kept counting money,
and all my wishes faded away.

203
00:15:49,092 --> 00:15:52,176
If I had gone to Mumbai,
I would have done...

204
00:15:52,259 --> 00:15:54,218
Much better than your Diti Basu.

205
00:15:54,884 --> 00:15:58,759
Now you tell me, does
she look like a heroine?

206
00:15:58,842 --> 00:16:00,425
Nothing compared to you.

207
00:16:02,218 --> 00:16:06,009
You know, I had a photograph
taken with Rajesh Khanna.

208
00:16:06,176 --> 00:16:11,759
The monster forced me
to destroy it after marriage.

209
00:16:13,592 --> 00:16:20,092
When Kaka died some
time back, I kept crying...

210
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:23,176
He asked why are you
crying? Who is he to you?

211
00:16:23,467 --> 00:16:29,176
How will he know? He
has no romance in him.

212
00:16:29,383 --> 00:16:31,759
Do you know what he does?

213
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,675
He keeps the bathroom
door ajar while doing his job.

214
00:16:34,842 --> 00:16:43,759
And then in front of all he
makes those awful sounds.

215
00:16:44,926 --> 00:16:46,550
I just can't take it any more.

216
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:52,592
Don't you have any
contacts with the film industry?

217
00:16:56,092 --> 00:16:57,592
Why don't you ask Diti Basu?

218
00:16:58,842 --> 00:17:00,926
She doesn't mix with anyone.

219
00:17:02,092 --> 00:17:10,259
If I had been her, oof, money,
parties, Press…the works.

220
00:17:14,717 --> 00:17:18,509
Oh god! I've forgotten
to lock the make up kit!

221
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:20,634
Lock?

222
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:29,218
Yes, the monster will throw all
my things away. I have to leave …

223
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:37,550
You have understood
all in such short time?

224
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:44,467
Not really
understood, but felt it.

225
00:17:46,634 --> 00:17:48,509
This house is too quiet.

226
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,509
This is not a primary
school Dr Sen.

227
00:17:55,634 --> 00:17:56,967
This is an old age home where...

228
00:17:57,051 --> 00:17:59,592
People are not expected to
run around, shout or scream!

229
00:18:00,092 --> 00:18:01,800
This is an old age home.

230
00:18:03,218 --> 00:18:07,592
People come here to spend
their last years peacefully.

231
00:18:10,467 --> 00:18:15,092
This is a home for people who
can't keep their parents with them.

232
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,218
It is a home.

233
00:18:18,425 --> 00:18:21,467
Where I focus on
quality and not quantity.

234
00:18:21,675 --> 00:18:23,383
I give them all kinds of care.

235
00:18:23,717 --> 00:18:28,592
So that I can justify the money
their children are paying for them.

236
00:18:29,634 --> 00:18:32,259
I'm not doing this
just to earn money.

237
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:39,967
Is it very important
to explain to them...

238
00:18:40,675 --> 00:18:43,259
That they are here
to live in peace.

239
00:18:43,467 --> 00:18:47,342
Even if I don't, they know it.

240
00:18:48,009 --> 00:18:52,134
You've been brought here to
study their psychosomatic behavior.

241
00:18:52,675 --> 00:18:53,884
Pay attention to that.

242
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:58,092
Don't try to understand
anymore than that.

243
00:18:58,259 --> 00:18:59,675
But I just want to...

244
00:19:02,051 --> 00:19:03,051
Tell me…

245
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,300
What?

246
00:19:10,092 --> 00:19:11,092
I'm coming.

247
00:19:15,634 --> 00:19:18,550
I come out and see
that Beethi is crying.

248
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:20,759
She is old enough to
be his granddaughter.

249
00:19:20,842 --> 00:19:26,383
What happened? Beethi,
why are you crying?

250
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:30,425
I went to perform
physiotherapy...

251
00:19:30,509 --> 00:19:32,967
But he didn't let me
come close to him.

252
00:19:33,092 --> 00:19:37,842
He said I smell like a buffalo.

253
00:19:38,092 --> 00:19:41,467
And then he suddenly
touched my breast.

254
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:44,176
You are losing your mind.

255
00:19:44,259 --> 00:19:46,300
I think he should be arrested.

256
00:19:46,425 --> 00:19:47,634
Hey! Call the police.

257
00:19:47,675 --> 00:19:50,675
No. I'm calling his son.

258
00:19:51,009 --> 00:19:52,550
I won't keep him here anymore.

259
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:53,759
No. What?

260
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:56,218
Didn't you think about
that when you grabbed her?

261
00:19:56,467 --> 00:19:58,467
Dr.Sinha.
- Get ready.

262
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:00,259
I will not tolerate this.

263
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,717
But my son has sent
money in advance.

264
00:20:03,342 --> 00:20:06,009
So! Is this a brothel?

265
00:20:07,092 --> 00:20:08,884
Please let him be.

266
00:20:09,467 --> 00:20:11,134
This may lead to a mishap.

267
00:20:11,884 --> 00:20:14,884
It's my request Dr.Sinha.

268
00:20:15,425 --> 00:20:17,759
Beethi, go now.

269
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:19,967
No, I won't. Why should I?

270
00:20:20,092 --> 00:20:22,051
Dirty old man.

271
00:20:22,176 --> 00:20:27,550
Greedy chap!
- Beethi! Don't create a scene!

272
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:28,759
Go!

273
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:35,759
You should not give an 85 year
old man, this much mental stress.

274
00:20:35,842 --> 00:20:37,300
This is my domain!

275
00:20:37,467 --> 00:20:39,176
And they are all
my responsibility!

276
00:20:39,259 --> 00:20:40,592
And they're my patients!

277
00:20:41,051 --> 00:20:43,259
I am their supervisor
and according to you...

278
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:46,092
I am responsible for
their well being, isn't it?

279
00:20:56,092 --> 00:20:58,926
Please go back to your rooms.

280
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:01,842
I will handle this. Please.

281
00:21:14,218 --> 00:21:19,509
I won't let him go! I will call
my brother's from the village.

282
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,176
You've insulted me!

283
00:21:21,218 --> 00:21:23,342
I won't spare you!

284
00:21:23,634 --> 00:21:29,592
Go now! Go!

285
00:21:30,884 --> 00:21:33,342
I'll get you!

286
00:21:34,134 --> 00:21:35,342
Disgusting!

287
00:21:38,926 --> 00:21:39,967
How could it have happened?

288
00:21:40,176 --> 00:21:42,176
Nothing has happened. Sit down.

289
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,842
How could I?

290
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:51,342
It was very wrong.

291
00:21:53,218 --> 00:21:54,884
Will Dr.Sen get rid of me?

292
00:21:57,884 --> 00:22:00,259
My family won't take me
back if they hear about this.

293
00:22:00,675 --> 00:22:05,218
Calm down.
- Relax.

294
00:22:06,051 --> 00:22:07,218
Will he get rid of me?

295
00:22:10,509 --> 00:22:15,425
It'll be tough to live there.

296
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:20,425
They want to take me but the
house is empty during the day…

297
00:22:20,884 --> 00:22:23,675
You won't go anywhere.
You'll stay right here.

298
00:22:24,717 --> 00:22:28,926
We're there for you.

299
00:22:30,592 --> 00:22:31,842
They were there too.

300
00:22:33,383 --> 00:22:34,092
So what?

301
00:22:34,176 --> 00:22:38,300
Dad, our house in the
U.S. stays empty all day.

302
00:22:38,467 --> 00:22:40,634
He leaves at 7AM.

303
00:22:40,884 --> 00:22:42,092
And I leave half an hour later.

304
00:22:42,425 --> 00:22:44,675
We return at 9 in the night.

305
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,884
The house remains empty all day.

306
00:22:47,259 --> 00:22:49,425
There will be no
one to look after you.

307
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:52,009
I can take care of myself.

308
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,592
Atleast I'll see you
at the end of the day.

309
00:22:55,675 --> 00:22:58,634
Amazing! We have
no domestic help there.

310
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,800
Understand that?

311
00:22:59,842 --> 00:23:02,550
Ma has taken care
of you all your life.

312
00:23:02,675 --> 00:23:07,092
Today she's not there and
we are very self – sufficient.

313
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:08,842
We can do everything
by ourselves.

314
00:23:09,051 --> 00:23:11,134
And your age is a factor.

315
00:23:11,342 --> 00:23:14,218
We can't leave you
alone to fend for yourself.

316
00:23:16,425 --> 00:23:18,800
And Grandpa this
home is very good.

317
00:23:19,009 --> 00:23:21,467
You'll get all your
comforts there.

318
00:23:23,509 --> 00:23:28,009
I'll get physical comfort,
but what about the heart?

319
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:32,342
None of you will be there.

320
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:35,218
Oh! we'll be there.

321
00:23:35,383 --> 00:23:38,218
We'll visit every
year. Like we do.

322
00:23:38,842 --> 00:23:42,842
And if everything
works out well...

323
00:23:42,926 --> 00:23:46,218
Then we'll take you
there for a holiday.

324
00:23:51,218 --> 00:23:53,675
I actually love the old man.

325
00:23:57,218 --> 00:24:00,592
If he had asked nicely I would
have given him what he wanted.

326
00:24:04,467 --> 00:24:07,342
He's going to die
any one of these days.

327
00:24:10,009 --> 00:24:12,383
He doesn't even let me near him.

328
00:24:13,926 --> 00:24:16,759
He says I smell like a buffalo.

329
00:24:19,675 --> 00:24:23,259
I've been massaging him for
a year. Don't I have feelings.

330
00:24:26,009 --> 00:24:30,342
He says I have a sweet
face, a good figure...

331
00:24:30,509 --> 00:24:33,092
He tries to grab me…

332
00:24:37,926 --> 00:24:41,383
If he asked I would have
given him everything.

333
00:24:41,467 --> 00:24:43,134
But…

334
00:24:46,842 --> 00:24:50,051
Keep quiet…

335
00:25:00,383 --> 00:25:02,134
I got angry…

336
00:25:02,383 --> 00:25:04,300
So I screamed.

337
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:10,926
His son is apparently
very hot – headed.

338
00:25:12,509 --> 00:25:15,550
He might never meet
him again because of this.

339
00:27:38,717 --> 00:27:39,967
Jaya…

340
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,467
Abhi!
- What?

341
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,592
What are you doing?

342
00:28:06,634 --> 00:28:08,092
You could have hurt yourself.

343
00:28:08,592 --> 00:28:09,592
What were you doing?

344
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:10,800
The phone…

345
00:28:11,467 --> 00:28:14,134
You want the phone? Ok.

346
00:28:15,467 --> 00:28:18,383
I will give you the phone.

347
00:28:18,884 --> 00:28:20,383
And that book.

348
00:28:20,717 --> 00:28:21,592
You want the book too?

349
00:28:21,634 --> 00:28:24,300
Yes.
- Ok wait.

350
00:28:26,342 --> 00:28:28,009
What's the matter?

351
00:28:28,134 --> 00:28:29,176
Why are you here?

352
00:28:29,383 --> 00:28:31,967
Abhi, what are you
doing with the phone?

353
00:28:33,383 --> 00:28:34,259
Abhi!

354
00:28:36,509 --> 00:28:39,675
Dr.Sen, if you need something,
you should wait in my office.

355
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:43,342
I don't allow unknown
people in my private quarters.

356
00:28:43,592 --> 00:28:45,176
But I haven't come to meet you.

357
00:28:45,342 --> 00:28:45,967
What?

358
00:28:46,926 --> 00:28:48,259
I came to meet A...

359
00:28:50,884 --> 00:28:51,926
Abhi come here.

360
00:28:52,842 --> 00:28:53,926
Come here!

361
00:28:55,092 --> 00:28:55,926
Abhi!

362
00:28:57,842 --> 00:29:02,218
Abhi come to me.

363
00:29:17,675 --> 00:29:19,550
Now tell me, why do you
need this phone book?

364
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,717
Whose number
are you looking for?

365
00:29:21,967 --> 00:29:22,842
My mother's.

366
00:29:23,092 --> 00:29:24,759
It's in this book.

367
00:29:26,383 --> 00:29:28,009
Are you not allowed
to call your mother?

368
00:29:32,218 --> 00:29:35,176
Then you shouldn't call
without informing your father.

369
00:29:35,467 --> 00:29:37,342
Baba doesn't let me call.

370
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,800
Ma left us.

371
00:29:41,383 --> 00:29:43,550
My parents used
to have huge fights.

372
00:29:44,134 --> 00:29:46,092
I've grown up now.

373
00:29:46,383 --> 00:29:48,218
So I can do things by myself.

374
00:29:48,592 --> 00:29:50,425
But my father still scolds me.

375
00:29:50,926 --> 00:29:52,592
He doesn't love me at all.

376
00:30:17,383 --> 00:30:18,759
Wow!

377
00:30:19,009 --> 00:30:20,342
You've set the
table so beautifully!

378
00:30:20,592 --> 00:30:22,884
From today we'll
all eat together.

379
00:30:23,009 --> 00:30:23,967
Sumita listen…

380
00:30:24,592 --> 00:30:27,259
Why are you staring
at me blankly?

381
00:30:27,342 --> 00:30:29,926
Madam there is no
camaraderie amongst them.

382
00:30:30,009 --> 00:30:32,926
They don't even
talk to each other.

383
00:30:32,967 --> 00:30:33,926
I'll take care of that.

384
00:30:34,051 --> 00:30:37,134
You put the plates
out and I'll call...

385
00:30:37,259 --> 00:30:40,259
Oh, do we have a vase?

386
00:30:40,425 --> 00:30:40,842
Yes.

387
00:30:40,884 --> 00:30:43,009
Then get some flowers from
the garden to decorate the table.

388
00:30:43,092 --> 00:30:44,342
I'll get them.

389
00:30:47,717 --> 00:30:50,300
Ashok Da, time to
get to the dining table.

390
00:30:50,509 --> 00:30:53,550
We'll eat lunch together.

391
00:31:01,051 --> 00:31:02,425
What are you looking at?

392
00:31:03,675 --> 00:31:04,842
Ashok Da?

393
00:31:05,051 --> 00:31:06,092
What are you looking at?

394
00:31:08,134 --> 00:31:08,884
Wait.

395
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,300
Won't we be served
lunch in our rooms today?

396
00:31:19,926 --> 00:31:20,509
No.

397
00:31:20,967 --> 00:31:22,425
You eat alone everyday.

398
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:25,009
Today we shall eat
together at the dining table.

399
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,176
We'll ask Dr.Sinha too.

400
00:31:27,259 --> 00:31:28,509
What's the occasion?

401
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:29,509
Life.

402
00:31:29,717 --> 00:31:31,884
It's a celebration in itself.

403
00:31:32,509 --> 00:31:33,134
Wow!

404
00:31:33,675 --> 00:31:35,717
Will Mrs. Bhaduri come aswell?

405
00:31:35,842 --> 00:31:36,592
Ofcourse.

406
00:31:37,092 --> 00:31:39,134
Please do get your wife along.

407
00:31:39,425 --> 00:31:41,383
Please make her
sit far away from me.

408
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:47,342
She'll take 10 hours to get
ready and then will scream at me…

409
00:31:48,926 --> 00:31:50,218
Ashok Da!

410
00:31:51,592 --> 00:31:53,259
Stop searching!

411
00:31:54,134 --> 00:31:55,634
There's no one there!

412
00:31:57,092 --> 00:31:58,634
No one is coming!

413
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:03,383
I'm going ahead.

414
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:09,218
Madam, let's go.

415
00:32:17,383 --> 00:32:19,342
What is he looking for?

416
00:32:19,592 --> 00:32:22,218
Ashok Da had gone to
Amarnath with his family.

417
00:32:23,425 --> 00:32:27,383
His entire family was
killed in a terrorist attack.

418
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:29,092
He doesn't talk much.

419
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:32,967
He keeps an eye out
for terrorists, just in case.

420
00:32:33,717 --> 00:32:36,092
His nephew left him here.

421
00:32:38,383 --> 00:32:41,759
At this age Paromita,
you can take it from me...

422
00:32:42,342 --> 00:32:45,884
Light and darkness do
not affect you anymore.

423
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:50,134
I will sit and listen
to you one day.

424
00:32:52,259 --> 00:32:54,092
And I will listen to you.

425
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,509
Scared you, did I?

426
00:33:06,592 --> 00:33:08,759
Where were you all
morning, wicked girl?

427
00:33:09,926 --> 00:33:11,800
I've been searching
for you all day.

428
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:14,009
Come with me.

429
00:33:14,218 --> 00:33:14,842
Where?

430
00:33:14,967 --> 00:33:15,926
To my room.

431
00:33:16,051 --> 00:33:17,134
Just come.

432
00:33:17,342 --> 00:33:18,300
Ok, let's go.

433
00:33:26,926 --> 00:33:27,967
Sumita!

434
00:33:28,218 --> 00:33:29,383
Coming!

435
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,092
You didn't give me
the list of medicines.

436
00:33:33,218 --> 00:33:34,926
Oh no! I forgot.
I'll just get it!

437
00:33:34,967 --> 00:33:36,051
Wait!

438
00:33:37,509 --> 00:33:39,550
Ask if anyone
needs anything else.

439
00:33:39,592 --> 00:33:40,467
I'll get it all together then.

440
00:33:40,509 --> 00:33:41,675
You'll eat lunch in
your room soon so…

441
00:33:41,717 --> 00:33:42,425
No, no.

442
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:44,550
Everyone is eating
in the dining room.

443
00:33:47,092 --> 00:33:48,383
What do you mean?

444
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:52,176
Madam asked everyone to
eat together at the dining table.

445
00:33:52,675 --> 00:33:53,300
What?

446
00:34:00,134 --> 00:34:01,634
This is called a shandy.

447
00:34:03,051 --> 00:34:06,634
A tasty drink made
with beer and lemonade.

448
00:34:07,259 --> 00:34:09,009
Here. Have some.

449
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,342
Wait.

450
00:34:16,675 --> 00:34:18,926
Cheers!
- Cheers!

451
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:21,383
Drink up!

452
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:23,009
Nothing will happen.

453
00:34:24,218 --> 00:34:26,467
I should drink it, right?
- Yes, yes.

454
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,884
Fantastic!

455
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,634
Good, isn't it?

456
00:34:43,926 --> 00:34:45,009
Where did you
learn how to make it?

457
00:34:45,134 --> 00:34:46,259
In New Jersey.

458
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:47,926
I used to live there.

459
00:34:48,176 --> 00:34:50,342
For 10 years, with my
daughter and her husband.

460
00:34:51,467 --> 00:34:54,550
They took me with them
after my husband passed away.

461
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,592
It's a beautiful place.

462
00:34:57,051 --> 00:35:01,675
But unfortunately
I'm a vegetarian and...

463
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,926
One who can't deal
with much English.

464
00:35:06,176 --> 00:35:08,509
So I used to be stuck at home.

465
00:35:09,134 --> 00:35:10,300
And your grandchildren?

466
00:35:11,467 --> 00:35:13,634
They're there. They were small.

467
00:35:13,967 --> 00:35:15,218
Then they got older…

468
00:35:15,717 --> 00:35:18,383
Their college was
nearly 150 Kms away.

469
00:35:18,467 --> 00:35:21,218
They used to speed
away in their cars.

470
00:35:21,967 --> 00:35:26,425
It was tough, but
that's the way it is there.

471
00:35:26,675 --> 00:35:30,425
So I used to stay at
home like a ghost…

472
00:35:31,675 --> 00:35:34,009
You'd get lonely,
wouldn't you? And bored?

473
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:36,092
Exactly.

474
00:35:38,592 --> 00:35:41,842
So I'd open the fridge
and mix whatever I'd get.

475
00:35:42,009 --> 00:35:46,009
One day my son-in-law said
that I had made a shandy!

476
00:35:46,134 --> 00:35:53,300
And after that he
gave me this book.

477
00:35:54,592 --> 00:35:56,509
Nice!

478
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:59,592
Seems like things
were going well.

479
00:36:01,342 --> 00:36:02,467
Why did you come back?

480
00:36:07,134 --> 00:36:08,383
Things were going well.

481
00:36:09,218 --> 00:36:12,550
But it was monotonous.

482
00:36:13,134 --> 00:36:14,342
And lonely.

483
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:18,467
So I told them that
I want to go back.

484
00:36:19,176 --> 00:36:21,051
I was yearning for Kolkata.

485
00:36:21,383 --> 00:36:23,467
So then they contacted Partho…

486
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,634
As in Dr.Sinha and
made arrangements.

487
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:35,383
You know, I had only
mentioned it once.

488
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:40,884
And they agreed.

489
00:36:44,926 --> 00:36:47,509
Anyway let's see
what you have done.

490
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:52,634
We will.

491
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,467
Let me sober up.

492
00:36:55,926 --> 00:36:57,176
Drank a lot.

493
00:36:57,383 --> 00:37:00,759
Time does flow, who shall float

494
00:37:01,342 --> 00:37:10,259
along on our
little country boat?

495
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,176
Time does flow, who shall float

496
00:37:14,759 --> 00:37:23,675
along on our
little country boat?

497
00:37:24,176 --> 00:37:27,550
Time does flow.

498
00:37:28,383 --> 00:37:30,259
Ok? Wow!

499
00:37:30,467 --> 00:37:33,051
Listen, listen, listen!

500
00:37:33,259 --> 00:37:34,134
I have an announcement.

501
00:37:34,383 --> 00:37:35,675
This is a mere sample.

502
00:37:35,926 --> 00:37:41,467
If this experiment of
togetherness is successful...

503
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:44,675
Then we'll try a whole
lot of other things.

504
00:37:45,259 --> 00:37:54,884
That is if your grumpy, angry,
Dr.Sinha doesn't have a problem.

505
00:37:58,467 --> 00:37:59,800
What a person.

506
00:37:59,842 --> 00:38:01,051
Know what I think?

507
00:38:01,259 --> 00:38:06,383
Being a psychiatrist I think that
I should have treated him first.

508
00:38:07,176 --> 00:38:08,467
What do you think?

509
00:38:09,218 --> 00:38:12,009
Right. You should have.

510
00:38:14,467 --> 00:38:15,300
What's wrong?

511
00:38:15,342 --> 00:38:18,300
Why are you all
sitting so grumpily?

512
00:38:20,467 --> 00:38:21,717
I'm there, aren't I?

513
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,467
Why do you need
to fear Dr.Sinha?

514
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:26,967
I'm there.

515
00:38:49,134 --> 00:38:50,134
Dr.Sinha!

516
00:38:52,176 --> 00:38:58,717
Please listen to
me, it was just a…

517
00:39:02,092 --> 00:39:03,383
Fun.

518
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,176
Shit!

519
00:39:22,967 --> 00:39:23,884
Eat.

520
00:39:26,259 --> 00:39:27,176
Please eat.

521
00:39:27,509 --> 00:39:29,842
Is the main gate…

522
00:39:29,884 --> 00:39:30,842
It's locked.

523
00:39:31,009 --> 00:39:31,800
Please eat.

524
00:39:34,509 --> 00:39:35,550
It's ok.

525
00:39:35,967 --> 00:39:37,300
It's all ok.

526
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:39,759
So, how's the food?

527
00:39:40,967 --> 00:39:42,134
Is it good?

528
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:43,383
Very...

529
00:39:44,842 --> 00:39:48,134
What's the matter? Ashok Babu?

530
00:39:49,926 --> 00:39:51,218
Why aren't you eating?

531
00:39:52,051 --> 00:39:53,092
No, no.

532
00:39:53,259 --> 00:39:56,509
Everyone's eating,
so you must eat too.

533
00:39:57,009 --> 00:39:58,383
You can't sit quietly.

534
00:39:58,467 --> 00:39:59,300
You have to eat.

535
00:39:59,467 --> 00:40:00,675
Open up.

536
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,051
Open your mouth.

537
00:40:03,383 --> 00:40:04,051
There we go.

538
00:40:11,092 --> 00:40:12,550
I remembered something…

539
00:40:15,842 --> 00:40:17,967
I had acted in a film
called the 'Deep Secret'.

540
00:40:18,051 --> 00:40:19,884
In the role of a nurse.

541
00:40:20,425 --> 00:40:22,467
Soumitra Babu was in it.

542
00:40:23,592 --> 00:40:25,967
The girl was nice
to everyone but...

543
00:40:27,009 --> 00:40:29,300
Was alienated
from her own family.

544
00:40:43,467 --> 00:40:46,134
Sumita gave me this for you.

545
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:48,425
I'm sorry.

546
00:40:51,259 --> 00:40:53,134
If you think that you are
the leader of the new wave...

547
00:40:53,259 --> 00:40:54,051
Then you are wrong.

548
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,759
Please leave tomorrow morning,
you are not needed any longer.

549
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,926
You are driving me away?

550
00:41:00,342 --> 00:41:02,425
You think I'm joking?

551
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:05,926
I thought you were
much more sporting.

552
00:41:06,717 --> 00:41:08,884
I said that I made a
mistake and I'm sorry.

553
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:10,967
I was trying to inspire…

554
00:41:11,009 --> 00:41:12,842
The guard will escort
you to a train tomorrow.

555
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,467
What happened?

556
00:41:22,634 --> 00:41:23,342
I'll go.

557
00:41:24,092 --> 00:41:25,800
I'm going to town
to buy medicines.

558
00:41:25,967 --> 00:41:27,425
And there is no
transport to Kolkata now!

559
00:41:27,592 --> 00:41:29,884
The driver will get
you a train tomorrow!

560
00:41:29,967 --> 00:41:31,634
Even I want to go to town!

561
00:41:33,134 --> 00:41:34,592
It's very important.

562
00:41:34,842 --> 00:41:38,342
Drop me there, and I'll get
a Trekker on the way back.

563
00:41:42,383 --> 00:41:44,300
I said I'm sorry.

564
00:41:45,884 --> 00:41:47,800
Trust me, it was just a joke.

565
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:51,926
One more chance?

566
00:41:52,383 --> 00:41:54,967
Dr.Sinha, please.

567
00:42:14,759 --> 00:42:16,926
Thanks for keeping
quiet the entire way here.

568
00:42:44,009 --> 00:42:45,342
Here you go.

569
00:42:47,134 --> 00:42:48,259
Drink up.

570
00:42:51,759 --> 00:42:53,218
Oh my!
- Good?

571
00:42:54,884 --> 00:42:58,717
I got the smell of beer
when I passed the window...

572
00:42:59,759 --> 00:43:00,800
But I didn't know that…

573
00:43:02,425 --> 00:43:03,509
I was intrigued.

574
00:43:03,717 --> 00:43:05,300
So you peeked?

575
00:43:05,675 --> 00:43:08,134
You are a strange man.

576
00:43:08,675 --> 00:43:11,634
If I hadn't peeked…

577
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:18,342
This is a Sandy?

578
00:43:19,176 --> 00:43:20,009
Shandy.

579
00:43:20,176 --> 00:43:22,592
Sh…

580
00:43:25,926 --> 00:43:27,092
Breath freshener?

581
00:43:27,592 --> 00:43:29,759
Will your wife scold you?

582
00:43:30,051 --> 00:43:31,342
Tell me about it!

583
00:43:34,592 --> 00:43:38,300
She doesn't even consider
me to be a human being.

584
00:43:39,592 --> 00:43:42,800
She was very nice
looking at one point.

585
00:43:43,717 --> 00:43:46,675
But age deteriorates…

586
00:43:48,383 --> 00:43:51,967
She can't still behave
like a 22 year old.

587
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:56,842
Give me some more.

588
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:58,051
Easy!

589
00:43:58,425 --> 00:43:59,759
Drink slowly.

590
00:43:59,842 --> 00:44:01,592
You'll get drunk.

591
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,884
Let me get bloody drunk.

592
00:44:03,134 --> 00:44:03,884
Sorry.

593
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,592
She'll come at me like
a lorry any moment now.

594
00:44:07,884 --> 00:44:09,342
Lorry?
- Yes.

595
00:44:09,926 --> 00:44:12,550
Her…

596
00:44:12,759 --> 00:44:13,842
Jaya?

597
00:44:14,009 --> 00:44:14,634
Yes.

598
00:44:15,009 --> 00:44:16,383
Lorry…

599
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:18,509
You are really strange.

600
00:44:21,842 --> 00:44:22,759
Here you go.

601
00:44:43,092 --> 00:44:44,134
What was that?

602
00:44:45,092 --> 00:44:46,759
Isn't that Kishori's son?

603
00:44:47,383 --> 00:44:49,967
He makes money
by selling the bottles.

604
00:44:50,342 --> 00:44:52,425
Nice arrangement.

605
00:44:52,967 --> 00:44:54,134
Who supplies you?

606
00:44:54,383 --> 00:44:55,884
That kid's father.

607
00:44:56,134 --> 00:44:57,259
Kishori!

608
00:45:00,675 --> 00:45:03,051
You are getting very brave.

609
00:45:03,134 --> 00:45:05,259
No I need to get back soon.

610
00:45:05,884 --> 00:45:07,967
Can't leave her
alone for very long.

611
00:45:08,425 --> 00:45:13,259
The daughters in law
could not take her...

612
00:45:13,509 --> 00:45:16,342
I am finishing it all, do
you have some for yourself?

613
00:45:16,467 --> 00:45:18,259
Don't worry, I do.

614
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:03,967
Have you seen my better half?

615
00:46:04,176 --> 00:46:06,467
I mean, Mr.Banerjee?

616
00:46:07,884 --> 00:46:08,717
Oh.

617
00:46:27,509 --> 00:46:30,342
I'll get angry if you
keep behaving that way.

618
00:46:35,092 --> 00:46:36,926
Why are you so greedy?

619
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:41,842
Where is that girl?

620
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:43,509
Paromita Di?

621
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:44,051
Yes.

622
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:45,717
She's gone in to town.

623
00:46:46,009 --> 00:46:47,009
Go to your room.

624
00:46:54,092 --> 00:46:55,717
I will marry you
in my next life.

625
00:46:56,134 --> 00:46:57,634
Then I'll give you everything.

626
00:46:59,009 --> 00:47:00,717
You think nothing happens
when you touch me?

627
00:47:01,092 --> 00:47:01,884
Let go.

628
00:47:02,509 --> 00:47:04,259
Don't act too smart.

629
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:05,967
If I don't look
after you, who will?

630
00:47:07,176 --> 00:47:08,134
What I did was ok.

631
00:47:09,218 --> 00:47:10,592
Will you get defiled
if I touch you?

632
00:47:11,884 --> 00:47:13,134
Bloody buffalo.

633
00:47:13,342 --> 00:47:14,759
Get lost! Don't touch me.

634
00:47:16,259 --> 00:47:20,425
Oh! My macho man!

635
00:47:33,759 --> 00:47:38,051
You've started shitting
with the door open again?

636
00:47:40,592 --> 00:47:42,259
This is just the beginning.

637
00:47:53,342 --> 00:47:54,675
What are you doing?

638
00:47:54,759 --> 00:47:56,634
Stay locked in there!

639
00:48:04,259 --> 00:48:05,092
You?

640
00:48:05,259 --> 00:48:07,634
You don't have a
shopping schedule, do you?

641
00:48:07,717 --> 00:48:08,051
Yes!

642
00:48:08,134 --> 00:48:10,176
Why are you waiting here?

643
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:11,009
Because I want to go back.

644
00:48:11,259 --> 00:48:13,300
But I had said that I...
- Get up!

645
00:48:14,009 --> 00:48:17,092
No conversation on the way...
- Get up!

646
00:48:54,051 --> 00:48:55,800
Abhimanyu was talking about you.

647
00:48:59,634 --> 00:49:00,467
What was he saying?

648
00:49:01,634 --> 00:49:03,218
He said he wanted to come along.

649
00:49:04,967 --> 00:49:06,092
I said no.

650
00:49:07,467 --> 00:49:10,342
Can you do anything
except say 'no'?

651
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:12,509
Sorry.

652
00:49:13,383 --> 00:49:14,634
He's become very naughty.

653
00:49:15,176 --> 00:49:17,218
He breaks, drops
and throws things!

654
00:49:19,092 --> 00:49:22,259
Do you remember what
you were like at his age?

655
00:49:24,884 --> 00:49:26,218
He's not at fault.

656
00:49:29,342 --> 00:49:33,467
No. It's all my fault.

657
00:49:39,634 --> 00:49:42,550
If you wouldn't mind,
could I say something?

658
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:47,259
You are trying to
discipline Abhimanyu but...

659
00:49:47,717 --> 00:49:51,051
you've unknowingly tied
him to a strict regime…

660
00:49:52,592 --> 00:49:54,842
You think you're
looking after him...

661
00:49:55,259 --> 00:49:57,218
And his interests…

662
00:49:57,467 --> 00:50:03,300
But have you ever thought of
what's going on in the child's mind.

663
00:50:07,967 --> 00:50:11,051
His world is not
as dreadful as ours.

664
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:14,176
Dreadful?

665
00:50:16,759 --> 00:50:19,550
I mean complicated.

666
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:32,967
Hey! Open the door!

667
00:50:34,218 --> 00:50:39,592
What's your problem!
Oh God! Open the door!

668
00:50:40,467 --> 00:50:44,759
Open up!...

669
00:50:49,842 --> 00:50:51,634
Why did you shut the door?

670
00:50:54,926 --> 00:50:58,800
Is this your dad's door?

671
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,634
What is that smell?

672
00:51:02,134 --> 00:51:03,218
Laxative.

673
00:51:03,509 --> 00:51:07,967
No it's a sweet smell.

674
00:51:09,425 --> 00:51:11,051
It's alcohol.

675
00:51:11,218 --> 00:51:14,092
Alcohol? You drank?

676
00:51:14,675 --> 00:51:15,717
Where?

677
00:51:16,634 --> 00:51:18,259
My friend gave me some.

678
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:20,467
Anasua.

679
00:51:22,550 --> 00:51:25,425
She made a shandy for me.

680
00:51:25,592 --> 00:51:28,051
You don't notice anything
other than my shitting.

681
00:51:28,842 --> 00:51:30,092
She talks to me.

682
00:51:30,842 --> 00:51:31,717
Tells me stories.

683
00:51:47,425 --> 00:51:50,467
What happened?
- Didi, come fast.

684
00:51:50,592 --> 00:51:54,259
The great war has begun!

685
00:51:57,259 --> 00:51:59,800
All the characterless
people have assembled here!

686
00:52:01,009 --> 00:52:03,092
Drunkards. Skanks!

687
00:52:03,176 --> 00:52:05,342
I'm going to inform
Sinha. Right now!

688
00:52:06,134 --> 00:52:06,842
What's wrong?

689
00:52:06,843 --> 00:52:10,800
I gave Shibu some beer, the
kind which you had, remember?

690
00:52:10,842 --> 00:52:11,342
Ya.

691
00:52:11,383 --> 00:52:13,842
I don't know what
he's said to her...

692
00:52:13,967 --> 00:52:15,176
But she's very angry!

693
00:52:15,218 --> 00:52:17,342
Don't be coy!

694
00:52:17,383 --> 00:52:18,634
I know you!

695
00:52:19,383 --> 00:52:20,800
Old hag!

696
00:52:20,926 --> 00:52:23,092
Leave!

697
00:52:24,009 --> 00:52:25,092
Shut the door.

698
00:52:25,550 --> 00:52:27,383
Jaya Di, sit down.

699
00:52:27,467 --> 00:52:29,259
No, I won't sit on this bed!

700
00:52:29,383 --> 00:52:30,926
Sit, just once.
- No!

701
00:52:30,967 --> 00:52:34,967
Why are you being
childish? Just sit here.

702
00:52:38,134 --> 00:52:39,342
Now tell me what happened.

703
00:52:39,383 --> 00:52:41,550
Is this a brothel?

704
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,592
You know what she
did to my husband?

705
00:52:43,675 --> 00:52:45,884
Is it something you
should say out loud?

706
00:52:46,051 --> 00:52:47,509
How can I allow it to happen.

707
00:52:47,759 --> 00:52:49,926
He'll become a drunkard!

708
00:52:49,967 --> 00:52:52,383
It's a shandy. Not alcohol.

709
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:54,383
Have you ever had some?

710
00:52:54,842 --> 00:52:56,383
Film stars have it.

711
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:10,467
My wife had a
mole on her breast.

712
00:53:12,176 --> 00:53:14,550
She'd get excited
when I touched it.

713
00:53:16,425 --> 00:53:18,176
She'd keep shying away.

714
00:53:21,009 --> 00:53:25,717
At that time, I never
thought I'd live till 85.

715
00:53:29,009 --> 00:53:31,550
I can still see the mole
in front of my eyes.

716
00:53:38,259 --> 00:53:42,842
Please don't mind what I said.

717
00:53:43,009 --> 00:53:45,176
No, no I don't mind at all.

718
00:53:46,842 --> 00:53:49,300
It's amazing!

719
00:53:50,176 --> 00:53:51,509
It happens between friends.

720
00:53:54,550 --> 00:53:55,926
Isn't that true, Deeti Di?

721
00:53:56,176 --> 00:53:57,259
Yes, of course.

722
00:53:57,884 --> 00:53:59,051
But you're blessed.

723
00:53:59,467 --> 00:54:01,051
Such a wonderful husband.

724
00:54:01,467 --> 00:54:03,134
You'd never have that
if you were in to films.

725
00:54:03,467 --> 00:54:04,134
Why?

726
00:54:04,383 --> 00:54:06,259
Would I not have
made it into films?

727
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:08,300
No! No! Of course you would.

728
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:10,383
But it's terrible! You're lucky.

729
00:54:10,467 --> 00:54:13,509
Deeti Di, why did you leave it?

730
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:15,509
I mean all the
fame. All the money.

731
00:54:15,675 --> 00:54:16,634
Why?

732
00:54:17,759 --> 00:54:19,967
Because I had
nothing else to leave.

733
00:54:24,509 --> 00:54:26,550
Give me a cigarette.

734
00:54:27,176 --> 00:54:28,509
You want to smoke?
- Yes.

735
00:54:31,051 --> 00:54:35,051
10 years ago, my
last film had released.

736
00:54:36,842 --> 00:54:38,634
I couldn't hide my age.

737
00:54:39,634 --> 00:54:41,383
And I couldn't
get in to character.

738
00:54:42,634 --> 00:54:45,842
The film was taken out of
theatres by the 2nd week.

739
00:54:48,509 --> 00:54:50,800
Dibya had left me a month back.

740
00:54:51,383 --> 00:54:53,425
We'd got bored of each other.

741
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:54,967
Who's Dibya?
- Her boyfriend.

742
00:54:55,592 --> 00:54:58,634
He left me for a serial actress.

743
00:54:59,759 --> 00:55:01,092
Half his age.

744
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,051
I didn't say a word.

745
00:55:04,176 --> 00:55:04,800
Why?

746
00:55:06,842 --> 00:55:10,342
In my world you
start judging yourself.

747
00:55:11,759 --> 00:55:16,884
The photographers at a party,
the young men who try to flirt.

748
00:55:18,634 --> 00:55:21,926
Age doesn't stop you
from rating your popularity.

749
00:55:22,134 --> 00:55:23,176
Demand!

750
00:55:23,383 --> 00:55:24,717
How much demand?

751
00:55:25,634 --> 00:55:27,383
A flat, a car.

752
00:55:29,467 --> 00:55:32,009
From Shipra, in
Bijoygarh colony to...

753
00:55:32,383 --> 00:55:34,759
Deeti Basu, of
Ballygunge Apartments.

754
00:55:38,759 --> 00:55:39,634
Then what?

755
00:55:40,383 --> 00:55:42,675
I demanded 2 Crores from Dibya.

756
00:55:43,634 --> 00:55:46,342
Said he would have
me beaten up by goons.

757
00:55:48,383 --> 00:55:49,425
I drank a lot.

758
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:53,259
Decided to kill myself.

759
00:55:56,134 --> 00:55:59,051
It was around 10:30 at night.

760
00:56:00,009 --> 00:56:01,092
The doorbell rang.

761
00:56:02,342 --> 00:56:04,092
I thought Dibya…

762
00:56:04,717 --> 00:56:05,967
Had sent goons.

763
00:56:17,926 --> 00:56:19,300
Bastard!

764
00:56:19,926 --> 00:56:21,009
I'm coming!

765
00:56:59,759 --> 00:57:02,634
Who do you want?

766
00:57:04,550 --> 00:57:10,300
I'm Esha, this is
my friend Santanu.

767
00:57:31,425 --> 00:57:36,383
Well, I'm a little upset.

768
00:57:39,176 --> 00:57:45,300
It'd be good if you could
come some other time.

769
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:03,759
Excuse me.

770
00:58:14,342 --> 00:58:15,467
Thank you.

771
00:58:19,383 --> 00:58:21,842
Want me to act in a film, right?

772
00:58:23,051 --> 00:58:24,800
Could you pay me an advance?

773
00:58:28,009 --> 00:58:29,383
I'll take 10.

774
00:58:32,218 --> 00:58:33,218
At one go.

775
00:58:37,009 --> 00:58:39,092
Do you remember that
song I performed to?

776
00:58:41,634 --> 00:58:45,675
Immerse yourself in
the perfume of love...

777
00:58:46,592 --> 00:58:49,300
And come to me, Oh Shyam!

778
00:58:50,383 --> 00:58:52,675
Come close to me…

779
00:58:52,717 --> 00:58:53,634
Shyam!

780
00:58:53,967 --> 00:58:58,383
Come close Shyam...

781
00:59:01,967 --> 00:59:04,259
I think we should come tomorrow.

782
00:59:04,634 --> 00:59:06,300
With the money.

783
00:59:07,009 --> 00:59:08,759
I have no free dates.

784
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:11,592
Ok, ok.

785
00:59:12,592 --> 00:59:15,176
Who's the director? You?

786
00:59:16,092 --> 00:59:16,717
Ma.

787
00:59:18,218 --> 00:59:20,884
I felt that everything
had become empty.

788
00:59:22,176 --> 00:59:23,759
The ground was shaking.

789
00:59:24,592 --> 00:59:25,675
Your daughter?

790
00:59:29,550 --> 00:59:32,009
I had left her 25 years back.

791
00:59:34,134 --> 00:59:35,759
She was about 1 year old.

792
00:59:37,634 --> 00:59:39,800
Bublai hadn't seen a
single one of my films.

793
00:59:40,176 --> 00:59:41,092
Out of hatred.

794
00:59:43,176 --> 00:59:47,592
Her father worked
and tutored her.

795
00:59:49,259 --> 00:59:50,800
Baba died a year back.

796
00:59:52,759 --> 00:59:54,218
I was told not to inform you.

797
00:59:56,592 --> 00:59:58,342
Baba told me to wait a year.

798
01:00:00,218 --> 01:00:01,092
This is for you.

799
01:00:26,383 --> 01:00:28,717
Let's go. I'll see you.

800
01:00:29,926 --> 01:00:32,884
Bubul, my baby…

801
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:37,675
My baby…

802
01:00:47,592 --> 01:00:48,884
You've lost Shipra.

803
01:00:49,842 --> 01:00:52,009
Esha is a big
research scholar now.

804
01:00:53,259 --> 01:00:54,967
I gave her everything I could.

805
01:00:56,092 --> 01:00:59,383
You had said that I would
need to beg from you.

806
01:01:00,425 --> 01:01:01,842
But I didn't.

807
01:01:02,967 --> 01:01:07,300
I did not have much
but I had enough.

808
01:01:08,259 --> 01:01:12,967
I can well imagine
what you have achieved.

809
01:01:35,218 --> 01:01:38,425
I can see an ill defined
borderline in my dreams.

810
01:01:39,383 --> 01:01:41,842
It's becoming less clear.

811
01:01:42,259 --> 01:01:44,342
I felt like staying alive.

812
01:01:44,675 --> 01:01:46,884
And now I fear death.

813
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:51,509
Sent my new mobile
number to Apu today.

814
01:01:52,176 --> 01:01:54,842
I can imagine how
worried Apu was.

815
01:01:56,759 --> 01:01:58,926
Apu loves me blindly.

816
01:02:05,176 --> 01:02:06,634
This is my nephew.

817
01:02:06,967 --> 01:02:08,634
And my niece.

818
01:02:08,926 --> 01:02:11,675
Are they both settled?

819
01:02:12,176 --> 01:02:12,884
Yes.

820
01:02:13,425 --> 01:02:17,425
Their parents died in a
plane crash, after that I…

821
01:02:18,051 --> 01:02:21,717
Got my niece married,
and my nephew's working.

822
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:22,717
What else…

823
01:02:23,176 --> 01:02:25,634
Didn't think about
your own life?

824
01:02:26,675 --> 01:02:28,967
I was fond of music.

825
01:02:29,051 --> 01:02:33,800
Here I am… Singing.

826
01:02:35,259 --> 01:02:41,218
After my brother and his
wife died, I was in a fix.

827
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:45,800
My niece was 10 and he was 7.

828
01:02:46,176 --> 01:02:49,967
After that I had to look
for a job, raise them…

829
01:02:50,675 --> 01:02:53,425
When I got back to my music...

830
01:02:53,759 --> 01:02:57,342
I could see silver hair
on my notation pad.

831
01:02:58,176 --> 01:03:00,842
No, you should have got married.

832
01:03:01,176 --> 01:03:05,342
The body has its needs.

833
01:03:05,967 --> 01:03:07,550
The red mole on the breast.

834
01:03:08,176 --> 01:03:15,218
My Bul Bul is asleep, so
please don't wake her...

835
01:03:15,634 --> 01:03:16,800
You are impossible…

836
01:03:16,884 --> 01:03:18,967
Why do you talk so much?

837
01:03:19,009 --> 01:03:20,759
Age is making you…

838
01:03:21,383 --> 01:03:22,717
We are men of the flesh.

839
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,634
We don't talk about seeds.

840
01:03:24,926 --> 01:03:27,051
Bloody imposter.
- Why imposter?

841
01:03:28,550 --> 01:03:32,800
The more wood burns,
the louder it crackles.

842
01:03:33,092 --> 01:03:34,592
You'll know when
you reach my age.

843
01:03:34,884 --> 01:03:38,259
Hello! Hello! I have good news!

844
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:39,717
What is it?

845
01:03:39,967 --> 01:03:41,717
Let me apologise and come back.

846
01:03:51,009 --> 01:03:52,176
What's wrong young man?

847
01:03:53,675 --> 01:03:56,967
The cat says that he
won't touch the fish.

848
01:03:57,176 --> 01:03:58,259
Anyway…

849
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:03,550
Why has my heart started
fluttering, since you've come?

850
01:04:03,634 --> 01:04:06,425
After all, I'm a
trifle romantic.

851
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:08,342
Romantic?

852
01:04:08,509 --> 01:04:10,675
You're a playboy.

853
01:04:10,884 --> 01:04:13,134
What was the news?

854
01:04:13,467 --> 01:04:15,675
There's going to be a party.

855
01:04:15,717 --> 01:04:16,967
Party?

856
01:04:17,592 --> 01:04:18,634
That means drinks?

857
01:04:19,051 --> 01:04:19,884
You want to?

858
01:04:20,176 --> 01:04:21,342
I used to.

859
01:04:22,259 --> 01:04:24,218
But Dr.Sinha…

860
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:27,218
I had done a lot of
things. Everything.

861
01:04:27,259 --> 01:04:28,884
That's why I'm still running.

862
01:04:28,926 --> 01:04:31,675
If I'd been a teetotaller I
would have been gone by now.

863
01:04:32,550 --> 01:04:33,383
Hold it.
- What?

864
01:04:33,634 --> 01:04:34,134
Hold.

865
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:34,759
Ok.

866
01:04:37,342 --> 01:04:39,926
Grand Hotel!

867
01:04:40,009 --> 01:04:43,634
Your Grandma and
I used to ball dance.

868
01:04:45,051 --> 01:04:48,675
There was a white
man, his name was...

869
01:04:49,842 --> 01:04:50,842
Yes!

870
01:04:51,134 --> 01:04:52,675
Patrick!

871
01:04:54,092 --> 01:04:56,884
He used to play the
saxophone and we'd dance to it.

872
01:04:57,425 --> 01:04:59,842
I'm alone!

873
01:04:59,926 --> 01:05:01,800
I am alone…

874
01:05:02,009 --> 01:05:04,383
Beneath the sky…

875
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:07,425
I feel shy…

876
01:05:07,509 --> 01:05:11,051
To stay with a partner…

877
01:05:11,550 --> 01:05:13,717
Ladies and gentlemen…

878
01:05:13,926 --> 01:05:17,800
Now I present the
heart throb of Bengal...

879
01:05:18,092 --> 01:05:24,176
The gorgeous, one and
only – Ms. Deeti Basu.

880
01:05:24,218 --> 01:05:28,342
From the film, Hotel Casanova!

881
01:05:40,009 --> 01:05:44,842
Come close, Come closer to
me, Come close to me, my darling…

882
01:05:45,342 --> 01:05:50,051
Come close, Come closer to me...

883
01:05:50,592 --> 01:06:00,800
Come close to me, my darling…

884
01:06:01,342 --> 01:06:06,675
Come close, Come closer to
me, Come close to me, my darling…

885
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:16,383
Come close to me, my darling…

886
01:06:16,967 --> 01:06:26,884
Put your hand in mine, tonight.

887
01:06:27,134 --> 01:06:32,634
This beaming night,
a wondrous time...

888
01:06:32,717 --> 01:06:37,842
Excitement all around,
but a lonely heart…

889
01:06:37,967 --> 01:06:43,176
This beaming night,
a wondrous time...

890
01:06:43,218 --> 01:06:49,259
Excitement all around,
but a lonely heart…

891
01:06:49,383 --> 01:06:59,550
Come close, Come closer to
me, Come close to me, my darling…

892
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:58,425
If he doesn't survive,
I won't spare you!

893
01:07:59,176 --> 01:08:00,759
I'll cancel your registration!

894
01:08:01,092 --> 01:08:02,176
You'll be kicked out!

895
01:08:02,592 --> 01:08:04,218
Will Grandpa make it?

896
01:08:06,259 --> 01:08:08,218
Ask the one who
arranged the party.

897
01:08:09,342 --> 01:08:11,634
He's an 85 year old
cerebral person...

898
01:08:12,176 --> 01:08:13,717
His heart muscles are weak...

899
01:08:14,051 --> 01:08:16,383
Don't you know the
consequences of arterial dilation?

900
01:08:17,009 --> 01:08:18,092
Call yourself a doctor?

901
01:08:21,134 --> 01:08:22,800
Will he make it?

902
01:08:23,467 --> 01:08:25,134
Will he?

903
01:08:25,509 --> 01:08:27,259
Can't be certain
before 24 hours.

904
01:08:27,842 --> 01:08:29,342
No matter...

905
01:08:29,967 --> 01:08:32,550
Whatever happens
to him, you are out!

906
01:08:32,884 --> 01:08:33,926
That's for sure.

907
01:08:34,926 --> 01:08:35,884
So get packing.

908
01:08:51,967 --> 01:08:53,425
Apu sent me a text message.

909
01:08:53,634 --> 01:08:55,009
Wants to meet me.

910
01:08:55,634 --> 01:08:58,550
I didn't give him the
address. What good will it do?

911
01:08:58,967 --> 01:09:02,425
I'll have to leave tomorrow.

912
01:09:03,842 --> 01:09:06,218
Anjan asked Apu
about my whereabouts.

913
01:09:06,759 --> 01:09:08,717
Apu did not give
him any information...

914
01:09:10,342 --> 01:09:14,926
He sent a couplet
written by him in the SMS.

915
01:09:22,259 --> 01:09:23,218
Got my plan?

916
01:09:23,592 --> 01:09:25,259
Everything.

917
01:09:25,842 --> 01:09:27,009
Your lecture.

918
01:09:27,383 --> 01:09:28,509
Your US trip.

919
01:09:29,134 --> 01:09:31,967
The world famous
Dr.Anjan Banerjee!

920
01:09:33,759 --> 01:09:34,509
What about me?

921
01:09:34,926 --> 01:09:37,425
We start our second
innings when I get back.

922
01:09:38,051 --> 01:09:41,383
Here are the keys
to our flat in Saltlake.

923
01:09:42,051 --> 01:09:42,800
Take it.

924
01:09:44,383 --> 01:09:46,176
Will you design the interiors?

925
01:09:48,383 --> 01:09:49,051
Me?

926
01:09:49,259 --> 01:09:50,300
Interior?

927
01:09:50,759 --> 01:09:54,842
So you're telling me
to do this all alone?

928
01:09:55,134 --> 01:09:58,550
Not alone. After our
wedding we'll be a team.

929
01:09:58,634 --> 01:10:00,884
And kids will follow.

930
01:10:02,550 --> 01:10:03,800
How soon?

931
01:10:04,509 --> 01:10:07,176
As soon as possible.
I can't control myself.

932
01:10:07,509 --> 01:10:08,759
Two kids.

933
01:10:09,009 --> 01:10:12,134
Will take a picture with
one on each shoulder.

934
01:10:13,134 --> 01:10:13,926
What do you think?

935
01:10:15,425 --> 01:10:16,051
And me?

936
01:10:20,425 --> 01:10:21,926
Ma'am!

937
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:23,509
What are you doing here?

938
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,634
Please let me see him.

939
01:10:25,759 --> 01:10:27,717
This early?
- I'm begging you…

940
01:10:27,842 --> 01:10:28,967
Please... Just once…

941
01:10:29,009 --> 01:10:33,383
Please madam.

942
01:10:42,259 --> 01:10:44,467
I make my hands a vessel...

943
01:10:44,926 --> 01:10:48,592
And yet the water slips
through the cracks...

944
01:10:49,383 --> 01:10:53,550
Time grazes me
like an angry cat...

945
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:57,009
Please open the door for me.

946
01:10:57,884 --> 01:11:00,509
Paromita Di I won't
tell any one, promise.

947
01:11:01,884 --> 01:11:04,218
Atleast tell me where you are.

948
01:11:36,092 --> 01:11:37,550
Grandpa.

949
01:11:42,259 --> 01:11:43,342
Grandpa…

950
01:11:44,467 --> 01:11:46,550
Please lift your head.

951
01:11:46,675 --> 01:11:48,634
I need your blessings.

952
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:50,967
Grandpa…

953
01:12:00,009 --> 01:12:04,550
You smell like a buffalo.

954
01:12:07,634 --> 01:12:09,009
Madam!

955
01:12:20,383 --> 01:12:22,926
Come on. Easy…

956
01:12:23,218 --> 01:12:24,759
Help me!

957
01:12:24,926 --> 01:12:25,884
Be careful.

958
01:12:26,218 --> 01:12:27,675
Take him to the wheelchair.

959
01:12:28,842 --> 01:12:30,926
Take him to his room
and stay with him.

960
01:12:31,218 --> 01:12:33,717
Beethi, go call Sumita.

961
01:12:33,884 --> 01:12:35,717
Careful…

962
01:12:39,550 --> 01:12:43,425
Sit down slowly…

963
01:12:45,675 --> 01:12:48,967
Let's go.

964
01:12:54,592 --> 01:12:57,800
What Dr.Sinha did
was very wrong…

965
01:12:57,842 --> 01:12:59,051
Yes, doctor. Tell me.

966
01:12:59,759 --> 01:13:05,592
I'm back…

967
01:13:08,383 --> 01:13:09,342
What's the matter?

968
01:13:12,634 --> 01:13:13,759
Take care of yourself.

969
01:13:14,259 --> 01:13:15,383
Goodbye.

970
01:13:15,842 --> 01:13:16,842
What?

971
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:18,884
Where are you going?

972
01:13:19,926 --> 01:13:22,300
Shankar! Where is she going?

973
01:13:22,717 --> 01:13:25,383
Dr.Sinha is getting rid of her.

974
01:13:26,634 --> 01:13:27,967
What do you mean?

975
01:13:29,259 --> 01:13:32,550
He can't do that!

976
01:13:32,842 --> 01:13:34,675
Doctor!

977
01:13:34,926 --> 01:13:36,342
Come here!

978
01:13:36,675 --> 01:13:38,342
Please sit down!

979
01:13:38,383 --> 01:13:39,759
She can't go!

980
01:13:39,842 --> 01:13:41,509
Kick anyone else out!

981
01:13:41,717 --> 01:13:42,717
But not her!

982
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:44,967
Every institution has rules.

983
01:13:45,509 --> 01:13:46,967
You can't break them!

984
01:13:47,425 --> 01:13:50,509
We were all broken
when we got here.

985
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:53,717
For the first time you
got the right person.

986
01:13:54,134 --> 01:13:57,759
You won't find anyone
better before we die.

987
01:13:58,134 --> 01:14:01,467
If she leaves then we all will.

988
01:14:03,759 --> 01:14:04,967
I will for sure.

989
01:14:06,383 --> 01:14:07,634
There you go.

990
01:14:08,467 --> 01:14:12,259
Please explain to
me, what her job is?

991
01:14:13,092 --> 01:14:15,717
Is she a psychiatrist
or an entertainer?

992
01:14:16,467 --> 01:14:21,759
Her job is to treat you
for mental depression.

993
01:14:22,259 --> 01:14:24,134
Not organize parties!

994
01:14:24,759 --> 01:14:30,884
Dr.Sinha, they have stopped
coming since the party.

995
01:14:35,134 --> 01:14:40,259
The doors are open
but I'm not afraid.

996
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,800
No fear!

997
01:14:45,467 --> 01:14:48,134
There's no fear…

998
01:14:48,259 --> 01:14:51,259
There's no fear!

999
01:14:55,009 --> 01:14:56,550
There's no fear!

1000
01:14:57,259 --> 01:14:59,926
Partho is my
son-in-law's friend.

1001
01:15:00,259 --> 01:15:01,759
I know everything about him.

1002
01:15:02,425 --> 01:15:04,092
He's a good human being.

1003
01:15:04,383 --> 01:15:06,383
Somewhat like a coconut.

1004
01:15:06,634 --> 01:15:09,592
Hard on the outside
but soft on the inside.

1005
01:15:10,259 --> 01:15:12,926
His wife never understood that.

1006
01:15:13,550 --> 01:15:17,300
She eloped with a
friend of Partho's.

1007
01:15:17,592 --> 01:15:19,259
Left the child behind.

1008
01:15:20,842 --> 01:15:27,509
And the all encompassing Partho
has now opened this old age home.

1009
01:15:29,176 --> 01:15:33,176
Who is this sweet stranger?

1010
01:15:33,383 --> 01:15:35,467
Come here.

1011
01:15:38,759 --> 01:15:40,051
Baba allowed you to come here?

1012
01:15:40,259 --> 01:15:42,009
He's calling you.

1013
01:15:43,425 --> 01:15:44,926
Your father?
- Yes.

1014
01:15:47,550 --> 01:15:48,926
Me…

1015
01:15:49,425 --> 01:15:51,342
What have you done?

1016
01:15:53,383 --> 01:15:55,342
That's what I can't understand.

1017
01:15:57,176 --> 01:15:58,634
Can you tell me?

1018
01:16:20,759 --> 01:16:23,717
She doesn't allow me to
talk to my grand daughters.

1019
01:16:25,425 --> 01:16:27,092
I really want to.

1020
01:16:29,592 --> 01:16:31,134
I don't understand…

1021
01:16:32,509 --> 01:16:33,342
What?

1022
01:16:34,634 --> 01:16:37,134
What's the point of
increasing attachment?

1023
01:16:37,383 --> 01:16:40,425
The way you feel about
your grandchildren...

1024
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:44,884
Is the same way I felt
about my niece and nephew.

1025
01:16:46,425 --> 01:16:49,509
No, no. They adore you.

1026
01:16:51,634 --> 01:16:53,592
Don't you feel
like visiting them?

1027
01:16:55,051 --> 01:16:56,092
No.

1028
01:16:57,800 --> 01:16:59,800
I've signed the
house over to them.

1029
01:17:01,218 --> 01:17:04,759
But that's natural.
They love you.

1030
01:17:05,134 --> 01:17:07,926
And you've done
so much for them.

1031
01:17:14,467 --> 01:17:15,259
Who is it?

1032
01:17:15,926 --> 01:17:17,383
Boltu…

1033
01:17:17,592 --> 01:17:20,717
You old bugger! What
do you think of yourself?

1034
01:17:20,759 --> 01:17:21,383
Why have you come?

1035
01:17:21,467 --> 01:17:24,134
Do you think you'll keep
the house till you die?

1036
01:17:24,259 --> 01:17:25,634
No, no, listen…

1037
01:17:25,717 --> 01:17:28,134
Sis!
- Coming!

1038
01:17:28,176 --> 01:17:30,259
What's wrong?

1039
01:17:30,383 --> 01:17:33,759
This house is full of memories…

1040
01:17:33,967 --> 01:17:36,759
You're talking rubbish again!

1041
01:17:37,218 --> 01:17:39,134
Will you sign it over or not?

1042
01:17:39,176 --> 01:17:41,051
But you'll sell the house…

1043
01:17:42,134 --> 01:17:42,842
Hold him.

1044
01:17:43,009 --> 01:17:44,967
Bloody old man!

1045
01:17:45,009 --> 01:17:47,926
I'll slit your throat
if you don't sign!

1046
01:17:48,134 --> 01:17:50,967
Will you or shall I?
- I will.

1047
01:17:51,092 --> 01:17:52,550
Bloody Hell!

1048
01:17:53,884 --> 01:17:55,675
I'll give you everything.

1049
01:17:56,634 --> 01:17:58,759
Everything…

1050
01:17:59,634 --> 01:18:04,176
When people lived
in caves, this is how...

1051
01:18:04,259 --> 01:18:05,467
They acquired their property.

1052
01:18:05,675 --> 01:18:09,300
We are just an extension
of that uncivilized era.

1053
01:18:12,592 --> 01:18:15,259
Met some people
rather late in life.

1054
01:18:16,717 --> 01:18:22,550
Don't you feel the same?

1055
01:18:29,218 --> 01:18:30,176
Here...

1056
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:31,675
Thank you.

1057
01:18:40,051 --> 01:18:41,176
Abhi?

1058
01:18:41,967 --> 01:18:45,051
He is playing cricket
with Kishori's son.

1059
01:18:46,342 --> 01:18:47,967
He is my biggest worry.

1060
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:50,634
Why?

1061
01:18:55,383 --> 01:19:03,675
The day Tanu, my ex
wife left us, I came back...

1062
01:19:04,550 --> 01:19:09,383
To find Abhi lying
on the ground there.

1063
01:19:09,842 --> 01:19:11,342
Absolutely blue.

1064
01:19:12,842 --> 01:19:15,926
It was a silent attack
of epileptic seizure.

1065
01:19:16,467 --> 01:19:17,342
Epilepsy?

1066
01:19:20,842 --> 01:19:25,383
On his EEG graph the epileptic
focus was shining like a bright star.

1067
01:19:28,550 --> 01:19:37,134
You are a psychiatrist, can you tell
me why people still live after all this?

1068
01:19:40,342 --> 01:19:41,550
For life.

1069
01:19:43,967 --> 01:19:45,342
But that has no dimension.

1070
01:19:45,592 --> 01:19:49,259
You can't accurately specify
that this is the life you wanted.

1071
01:19:50,759 --> 01:19:53,092
You really have
a way with words.

1072
01:19:56,218 --> 01:19:57,926
After the Dipankar babu issue...

1073
01:19:59,009 --> 01:20:02,926
I thought you were
like others, selfish.

1074
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:07,051
I wanted to send
you away…And then...

1075
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:11,383
I should have left.

1076
01:20:15,383 --> 01:20:17,383
You can still leave,
its your choice.

1077
01:20:17,759 --> 01:20:20,800
I just thought I had
done an injustice to you...

1078
01:20:20,884 --> 01:20:22,759
So I asked you for coffee.

1079
01:20:27,425 --> 01:20:30,467
Daddy may I come in please?

1080
01:20:33,383 --> 01:20:34,634
Yes come.

1081
01:20:57,300 --> 01:20:59,675
Hey, whose are those?

1082
01:21:12,884 --> 01:21:15,342
Please, please let me
know where you are.

1083
01:21:16,383 --> 01:21:18,342
Want to meet you desperately.

1084
01:21:19,009 --> 01:21:20,926
Send me your address.

1085
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:29,675
Apu…

1086
01:21:36,675 --> 01:21:37,550
Lalda…

1087
01:21:39,592 --> 01:21:41,675
He's dead. You are
my cousin aren't you.

1088
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:42,926
Anjan leave him alone.

1089
01:21:43,259 --> 01:21:44,425
Apu go home.

1090
01:21:44,759 --> 01:21:46,218
Tell him the truth Paromitadi.

1091
01:21:46,383 --> 01:21:47,509
Apu keep quiet.

1092
01:21:48,009 --> 01:21:49,092
Why aren't you telling him?

1093
01:21:49,176 --> 01:21:51,550
Apu..
- Why aren't you…?

1094
01:21:53,259 --> 01:21:55,051
Apu, go home.

1095
01:22:01,342 --> 01:22:03,717
What do you have to tell
me? What is it he said?

1096
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:06,759
Anjan you are hurting me.

1097
01:22:12,176 --> 01:22:19,342
I can't marry you
Anjan, and this is final.

1098
01:22:25,051 --> 01:22:25,842
May I come in?

1099
01:22:25,926 --> 01:22:27,717
Yes please.

1100
01:22:36,926 --> 01:22:40,509
Wow! How beautiful
you are looking.

1101
01:22:44,718 --> 01:22:49,092
Come on why are you crying?

1102
01:22:49,384 --> 01:22:51,759
You are looking good.

1103
01:22:52,050 --> 01:22:55,551
No I am looking ugly, terrible.

1104
01:22:56,342 --> 01:22:59,383
Your Dwiti Basu, the actress
she told me to take it off..

1105
01:22:59,592 --> 01:23:06,009
She is right, the make up
covered your natural beauty.

1106
01:23:07,009 --> 01:23:10,592
Jayadi, each phase in
life has its own beauty.

1107
01:23:10,926 --> 01:23:15,884
Yes, but if suddenly
someone offers me a role?

1108
01:23:15,926 --> 01:23:18,467
Turn it down, say
you won't do it.

1109
01:23:21,592 --> 01:23:26,800
Mrs Banrjee, accept the fact that
what has gone way will not return.

1110
01:23:27,550 --> 01:23:29,926
Do dress up, but
according to your age.

1111
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:33,550
With grace, not with
too much make up.

1112
01:23:33,759 --> 01:23:36,425
You are really looking good.

1113
01:23:41,259 --> 01:23:42,509
Has he seen you?

1114
01:23:57,259 --> 01:24:02,259
Oh my, who is
this? Looks familiar...

1115
01:24:03,425 --> 01:24:06,467
Could be some relic from
the Mahenjodaro civilization?

1116
01:24:06,842 --> 01:24:12,134
I know I am looking
awful, Paromita, Dwiti…

1117
01:24:12,342 --> 01:24:12,842
What's wrong?

1118
01:24:12,926 --> 01:24:15,800
I told you I was
looking terrible...

1119
01:24:15,842 --> 01:24:17,759
He can't even recognize me.

1120
01:24:17,926 --> 01:24:20,092
Shiboprasad babu
what have you told her?

1121
01:24:20,134 --> 01:24:23,634
I have said nothing, I
just said she was like this.

1122
01:24:23,842 --> 01:24:29,092
When I saw her
first 40 years back.

1123
01:24:29,218 --> 01:24:30,967
I had forgotten
the look of this face.

1124
01:24:31,134 --> 01:24:37,383
So, now what? You don't
know how beautiful you are.

1125
01:24:37,550 --> 01:24:41,009
Paromita, take a snap of theirs
and post it for their children.

1126
01:24:42,467 --> 01:24:46,509
I am going to Anasuya, I
have to ask her something.

1127
01:24:47,467 --> 01:24:51,259
She is embarrassed...

1128
01:24:52,176 --> 01:24:56,300
You may go and visit your
children sometime, take a holiday.

1129
01:24:56,634 --> 01:24:57,717
Are you mad?

1130
01:24:58,675 --> 01:25:03,176
She will cook oily mutton for
them, and they only eat health food.

1131
01:25:03,467 --> 01:25:06,092
How can our daughter
in law tolerate it?

1132
01:25:06,218 --> 01:25:10,383
She says her son
is loosing weight...

1133
01:25:11,176 --> 01:25:13,675
They are sleeping
till late on weekends...

1134
01:25:13,926 --> 01:25:16,634
Let them...

1135
01:25:18,009 --> 01:25:21,300
Why doesn't the daughter
in law fast on puja days…

1136
01:25:21,425 --> 01:25:23,926
Just imagine the
world she lives in…

1137
01:25:24,259 --> 01:25:26,592
And I have a potty problem.

1138
01:25:28,926 --> 01:25:33,884
Actually if she gets rid of her acting
obsession, things will be normal.

1139
01:25:33,926 --> 01:25:35,550
You are right.

1140
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:45,509
Sir.

1141
01:25:45,842 --> 01:25:46,550
Come in.

1142
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:54,176
Take a seat.
- No thank you.

1143
01:25:55,176 --> 01:25:56,383
Are you unwell?

1144
01:25:57,300 --> 01:25:58,092
Why sir?

1145
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:00,884
You are looking trifle pale.

1146
01:26:08,842 --> 01:26:09,967
What are you thinking of?

1147
01:26:11,967 --> 01:26:12,634
Sir?

1148
01:26:13,467 --> 01:26:15,134
No nothing as such.

1149
01:26:15,509 --> 01:26:18,342
You must get your haemoglobin
count checked once…

1150
01:26:18,592 --> 01:26:22,425
I am not sleeping well…

1151
01:26:22,926 --> 01:26:23,634
Why?

1152
01:26:25,717 --> 01:26:26,842
Nothing as such.

1153
01:26:27,425 --> 01:26:29,967
You said Rima Chatterjee's
daughter's phone number...

1154
01:26:30,009 --> 01:26:31,300
was not in the file, here it is.

1155
01:26:31,509 --> 01:26:32,509
Thank you Sir.

1156
01:26:32,717 --> 01:26:37,092
Dr Sen I had a request.

1157
01:26:37,967 --> 01:26:39,842
Not mine really, but Abhi's…

1158
01:26:39,926 --> 01:26:42,884
If you could dine
with us tonight.

1159
01:26:48,092 --> 01:26:51,051
Suddenly a dinner invitation…..

1160
01:26:54,467 --> 01:26:58,342
Nothing formal, just.. but
do come on time please.

1161
01:27:01,926 --> 01:27:05,509
Time does flow, who shall float.

1162
01:27:05,550 --> 01:27:11,425
Along on our
little country boat?

1163
01:27:12,092 --> 01:27:15,675
Time does flow, who shall float.

1164
01:27:15,717 --> 01:27:21,592
Along on our
little country boat?

1165
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:27,634
That broad has a lot of brains.

1166
01:27:28,009 --> 01:27:28,717
Really?

1167
01:27:29,467 --> 01:27:30,592
Didn't you notice her buttocks?

1168
01:27:30,967 --> 01:27:34,009
The bigger the buttocks,
more intelligent the person.

1169
01:27:35,092 --> 01:27:38,675
According to you the elephant
is more intelligent than humans?

1170
01:27:40,218 --> 01:27:43,218
Physicality still
dominates your life….

1171
01:27:46,134 --> 01:27:48,592
And you are sage aren't you?

1172
01:27:50,009 --> 01:27:51,176
Do you know Urdu couplets?

1173
01:27:52,467 --> 01:27:55,717
What will you notice
beyond the breasts?

1174
01:27:56,884 --> 01:27:59,300
The beauty of the
woman lies yonder!

1175
01:28:00,550 --> 01:28:06,383
The eyes will notice the breasts As
the woman's beauty is stored there.

1176
01:28:06,634 --> 01:28:09,342
Let me touch your
feet, you are something..

1177
01:28:09,425 --> 01:28:10,342
No no let it be.

1178
01:28:10,842 --> 01:28:12,051
You are great.

1179
01:28:12,383 --> 01:28:18,884
The tender arms hide the
budding breasts in shame...

1180
01:28:19,092 --> 01:28:25,926
Shielding the innermost
feelings of the heart within.

1181
01:28:27,675 --> 01:28:32,550
Rabindranath( Tagore) so
the Bengali cannot protest!

1182
01:28:33,218 --> 01:28:37,383
Get rid off all those
pretensions, you will die any day..

1183
01:28:38,300 --> 01:28:41,675
So sing a song of
the spirit of spring…

1184
01:28:42,717 --> 01:28:44,425
Spring?

1185
01:28:47,051 --> 01:28:53,342
The flowers are
a blooming today.

1186
01:28:53,967 --> 01:29:00,259
The flowers are
a blooming today.

1187
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:12,675
They are moving with
the mind's desire for love..

1188
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:18,759
And waves of that desire
are splashing down..

1189
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:24,218
The flowers are
a blooming today.

1190
01:29:24,759 --> 01:29:30,176
The flowers are
a blooming today.

1191
01:29:31,092 --> 01:29:41,051
They are moving with
the mind's desire for love..

1192
01:29:42,051 --> 01:29:46,842
And waves of that desire
are splashing down..

1193
01:29:47,051 --> 01:29:52,509
The flowers are
a blooming today.

1194
01:29:53,092 --> 01:29:58,550
The flowers are
a blooming today.

1195
01:30:10,218 --> 01:30:15,467
The scent of love is in the air.

1196
01:30:15,717 --> 01:30:21,134
And the wind is fainting in joy.

1197
01:30:21,842 --> 01:30:27,092
The scent of love is in the air.

1198
01:30:27,342 --> 01:30:32,218
And the wind is fainting in joy.

1199
01:30:32,634 --> 01:30:43,842
As the bees buzz around
spreading the news….

1200
01:30:44,051 --> 01:30:54,509
The world falls prey
to this mandate of love.

1201
01:30:54,717 --> 01:31:00,300
The flowers are
a blooming today.

1202
01:31:00,759 --> 01:31:06,342
The flowers are
a blooming today.

1203
01:31:37,583 --> 01:31:39,875
Let me give you
another piece of fish.

1204
01:31:40,042 --> 01:31:41,667
No no I'm done.

1205
01:31:41,792 --> 01:31:43,251
Sure?
- I am through.

1206
01:31:44,625 --> 01:31:47,834
Was the food ok?
- It was good!

1207
01:31:51,325 --> 01:31:54,200
You will come
everyday at dinner.

1208
01:31:55,817 --> 01:31:56,567
Me?

1209
01:31:56,950 --> 01:31:58,659
Yes, dad said so.

1210
01:32:01,992 --> 01:32:06,368
Actually he was
making a fuss so I said it.

1211
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:15,375
I was just trying to pacify
Abhi, that's why I said.

1212
01:32:15,542 --> 01:32:18,500
That about you coming over…
please don't take it otherwise.

1213
01:32:18,584 --> 01:32:19,667
Don't worry I understand.

1214
01:32:20,209 --> 01:32:21,876
But your cook is really good.

1215
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:26,126
I cooked.

1216
01:32:26,584 --> 01:32:27,709
Really?

1217
01:32:28,084 --> 01:32:30,084
Yes cooking was
a passion with me.

1218
01:32:30,709 --> 01:32:32,375
I had not cooked for a while...

1219
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:34,292
But today I felt like it
as you were coming.

1220
01:32:34,792 --> 01:32:38,126
Its difficult to relate
cooking and you.

1221
01:32:38,417 --> 01:32:39,084
Are you joking?

1222
01:32:39,126 --> 01:32:42,709
No I mean it. You take
things really seriously.

1223
01:32:43,917 --> 01:32:47,792
In the morning I had come
to ask you for something...

1224
01:32:48,042 --> 01:32:51,042
But your dinner invitation
threw me off and I forgot to ask.

1225
01:32:51,459 --> 01:32:55,292
And now your cooking
almost made me forget again.

1226
01:32:55,834 --> 01:32:56,375
What?

1227
01:32:59,333 --> 01:33:01,709
Dr Sinha, I am thinking
of staging a play.

1228
01:33:01,750 --> 01:33:02,876
I need your permission.

1229
01:33:04,709 --> 01:33:05,709
A play?

1230
01:33:06,542 --> 01:33:11,542
Yes the monotony of
life here has to be broken.

1231
01:33:14,250 --> 01:33:20,542
And Jayadi's desire to
act will also be fulfilled.

1232
01:33:25,417 --> 01:33:26,584
Why not!

1233
01:33:26,750 --> 01:33:28,959
Thank you, thank you so much.

1234
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:34,084
So we are performing
'Chirokumar Sabha', right?

1235
01:33:34,250 --> 01:33:35,042
Yes!

1236
01:33:35,168 --> 01:33:38,333
Chirokumar Sabha!
There are no female roles!

1237
01:33:39,042 --> 01:33:42,042
No, Jaya Di, there
are many female parts.

1238
01:33:42,375 --> 01:33:44,126
I'll give you a singing part.

1239
01:33:44,250 --> 01:33:45,333
The part of Nirabala.

1240
01:33:45,459 --> 01:33:46,584
Then I'll be Akshay.

1241
01:33:46,667 --> 01:33:48,709
No. You'll be Rashik Dada.

1242
01:33:49,126 --> 01:33:52,168
And Akshay will be played by…

1243
01:33:52,584 --> 01:33:54,001
You, Shankar Da.
- Who, me?

1244
01:33:54,375 --> 01:33:55,168
Rubbish!

1245
01:33:55,500 --> 01:33:58,667
Am I a widow or a married woman?

1246
01:33:58,834 --> 01:34:02,084
No, you'll be a youthful maiden.

1247
01:34:02,417 --> 01:34:04,667
You still look like
a little duckling.

1248
01:34:04,959 --> 01:34:06,709
Don't you dare!

1249
01:34:06,917 --> 01:34:09,876
I've been waiting to do
this part for a long time.

1250
01:34:10,042 --> 01:34:11,917
Ok! Stop fighting.

1251
01:34:12,500 --> 01:34:14,917
So will I be Jagattarini?

1252
01:34:15,375 --> 01:34:17,084
Yes, you will.

1253
01:34:17,209 --> 01:34:19,042
I can't sing.

1254
01:34:19,209 --> 01:34:21,292
Let me finish. You
don't need to sing.

1255
01:34:21,375 --> 01:34:23,792
You'll be Nripabala.

1256
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:28,042
And Shiv Da, you'll be Purna.

1257
01:34:28,333 --> 01:34:30,667
But I won't act opposite her.

1258
01:34:31,001 --> 01:34:34,625
I really can't take
this fighting anymore.

1259
01:34:35,042 --> 01:34:38,209
And let me clarify that
Dwiti Di, will play Shailabala.

1260
01:34:39,459 --> 01:34:42,333
Will she manage,
she's a film star?

1261
01:34:42,542 --> 01:34:43,584
She will.

1262
01:34:44,375 --> 01:34:48,292
Ashok Da, you will
have to play a part too.

1263
01:34:48,542 --> 01:34:50,250
Shrish.

1264
01:34:51,667 --> 01:34:53,042
Will I be able to?

1265
01:34:53,417 --> 01:34:55,209
Yes, of course!...

1266
01:34:55,792 --> 01:35:06,292
I stay close, so he can't
leave without a word,

1267
01:35:06,667 --> 01:35:16,542
But still my heart aches,

1268
01:35:16,959 --> 01:35:21,042
My eyes know no sleep,

1269
01:35:21,333 --> 01:35:27,500
I stay close, so he can't
leave without a word,

1270
01:35:33,709 --> 01:35:42,084
The traveller strode
into my heart amiss,

1271
01:35:42,667 --> 01:35:52,417
I fear his realisation, Will
take him away from me.

1272
01:35:52,792 --> 01:35:57,126
My eyes know no sleep,

1273
01:35:57,292 --> 01:36:03,375
I stay close, so he can't
leave without a word,

1274
01:36:03,834 --> 01:36:07,459
My eyes know no sleep,

1275
01:36:07,625 --> 01:36:13,667
I stay close, so he can't
leave without a word,

1276
01:36:18,292 --> 01:36:20,750
How does that benefit
you, Rashik Dada?

1277
01:36:21,209 --> 01:36:24,042
I couldn't take it.

1278
01:36:24,333 --> 01:36:25,500
What to do?

1279
01:36:26,042 --> 01:36:28,917
My sisters are getting
older every year…

1280
01:36:29,084 --> 01:36:30,126
Hasn't learnt anything…

1281
01:36:30,333 --> 01:36:32,084
And Boroma (Senior
mother) blames me.

1282
01:36:32,209 --> 01:36:35,126
She says that I
only sit and eat.

1283
01:36:36,375 --> 01:36:37,876
You eat… And then?

1284
01:36:38,126 --> 01:36:39,001
Tell me!

1285
01:36:39,333 --> 01:36:40,459
I will, I will…

1286
01:36:40,667 --> 01:36:41,834
Hasn't learnt a thing!

1287
01:36:42,292 --> 01:36:44,584
Granddaughter,
can I sing that song?

1288
01:36:44,750 --> 01:36:46,917
Which song?
- That one…

1289
01:36:47,417 --> 01:36:51,126
Bless me with
valour, And I will-

1290
01:36:51,459 --> 01:36:52,667
That's my line.
- No, I will!

1291
01:36:53,542 --> 01:36:55,792
What's my wish!

1292
01:36:56,168 --> 01:37:04,333
With a shot of soda,
And a pint of whisky.

1293
01:37:06,250 --> 01:37:09,750
Bless me with valour,
I will tell you my wish!

1294
01:37:09,876 --> 01:37:12,417
What is this? Shut up!

1295
01:37:12,542 --> 01:37:13,542
Where have the dialogues gone?

1296
01:37:13,625 --> 01:37:14,625
Where'll they go.
They're right here.

1297
01:37:14,834 --> 01:37:17,084
They've gone to the
bar with Rashik Babu.

1298
01:37:17,209 --> 01:37:18,417
This is a real
problem, Dipankar Da!

1299
01:37:18,625 --> 01:37:19,542
Why?

1300
01:37:19,667 --> 01:37:23,292
You haven't learnt your lines!
- But my memory…

1301
01:37:23,500 --> 01:37:24,750
I won't...

1302
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:29,084
Will you be able
to sing like me?

1303
01:37:29,542 --> 01:37:30,625
You can't...

1304
01:37:30,917 --> 01:37:31,792
Whose song is this?

1305
01:37:31,917 --> 01:37:32,917
Rabindranath.

1306
01:37:33,584 --> 01:37:34,209
Akshay!

1307
01:37:34,375 --> 01:37:37,209
Shankar Da please start singing.

1308
01:37:37,333 --> 01:37:38,709
We're wasting a lot of time.

1309
01:37:38,792 --> 01:37:40,168
Start singing!

1310
01:37:40,333 --> 01:37:41,250
But…

1311
01:37:41,417 --> 01:37:42,625
What's wrong? Start.

1312
01:37:42,834 --> 01:37:46,459
But listen, you won't
be able to sing it right.

1313
01:37:47,750 --> 01:37:49,709
Start! Start!

1314
01:37:50,417 --> 01:37:53,667
Bless me with valour,

1315
01:37:53,792 --> 01:37:56,417
I will tell you my wish!

1316
01:37:58,417 --> 01:38:01,917
with a shot of soda,

1317
01:38:02,542 --> 01:38:06,126
with a shot of soda,

1318
01:38:06,750 --> 01:38:09,417
And a pint of whisky.

1319
01:38:11,168 --> 01:38:16,168
And a pint of whisky.

1320
01:38:23,292 --> 01:38:24,001
What rubbish!

1321
01:38:24,417 --> 01:38:25,959
Hello Sonai.

1322
01:38:27,500 --> 01:38:30,876
Please may I speak to Ria Rimpa?

1323
01:38:34,250 --> 01:38:38,084
They are busy ma, attending
art classes. Call later.

1324
01:38:38,584 --> 01:38:42,333
When later.. you don't even
bother to pick up the phone.

1325
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:45,876
I am busy ma, can't
attend all calls all the time!

1326
01:38:46,042 --> 01:38:48,876
That means I can't speak
to my grand children.

1327
01:38:49,042 --> 01:38:50,375
...I also want to hear them.

1328
01:38:52,250 --> 01:38:58,542
Rimadi you are here.. and I
have been looking for you all over.

1329
01:38:58,709 --> 01:39:01,168
You said you would give
proxy for rehearsals with me.

1330
01:39:02,209 --> 01:39:04,625
Who do you call all the time?

1331
01:39:04,834 --> 01:39:08,959
Your daughter She doesn't
even care a fig for you.

1332
01:39:09,542 --> 01:39:11,917
Come on, come on.

1333
01:39:14,667 --> 01:39:18,959
What can I say? Being a Hindu
its difficult to maintain a diet,

1334
01:39:19,168 --> 01:39:22,876
Homegrown sag, and what lentils…

1335
01:39:22,959 --> 01:39:23,876
Kalai daal...

1336
01:39:23,917 --> 01:39:27,001
Oh yes Kalai dal, and…

1337
01:39:31,876 --> 01:39:35,209
There's very little dialogue Jayadi
You must concentrate and memorise.

1338
01:39:35,333 --> 01:39:36,375
You'll make it.

1339
01:39:36,750 --> 01:39:38,625
'It is difficult.'

1340
01:39:38,709 --> 01:39:42,084
'Oh yes it is difficult…
That's why I ...'

1341
01:39:42,542 --> 01:39:43,876
No there is no 'that's why I...'

1342
01:39:44,126 --> 01:39:45,500
Okay Okay, let her carry on.

1343
01:39:45,542 --> 01:39:49,667
If she can't remember this
little dialogue how will she act?

1344
01:39:51,042 --> 01:39:53,625
Shakti Samanta
asked for her Rubbish..

1345
01:39:53,792 --> 01:39:57,584
Now I know why he
never called her again.

1346
01:39:57,959 --> 01:39:59,292
Can't act to save her life...

1347
01:39:59,500 --> 01:40:01,959
The only thing she can do is
paint her face and look like a clown!

1348
01:40:09,876 --> 01:40:12,750
Jayadi, Jayadi...

1349
01:40:16,042 --> 01:40:20,584
What's wrong with you Rimadi?

1350
01:40:20,750 --> 01:40:22,667
Why were you so rude?

1351
01:40:22,917 --> 01:40:26,917
Believe me Paromita, I
didn't mean to be so rude..

1352
01:40:27,209 --> 01:40:31,459
It's just that I am feeling low.

1353
01:40:31,750 --> 01:40:36,417
My Daughter doesn't allow me
to speak to my grand daughters.

1354
01:40:38,333 --> 01:40:42,168
Is that why you were so rude?

1355
01:40:42,292 --> 01:40:43,625
Just think was it
the right thing to do?

1356
01:40:43,750 --> 01:40:45,584
No it wasn't…

1357
01:40:45,709 --> 01:40:49,917
But Jaya also said that my
daughter doesn't care a fig for me!

1358
01:40:51,625 --> 01:40:55,625
Thinking of all that I said it..

1359
01:40:55,917 --> 01:40:58,834
But it was a mistake,
a big mistake.

1360
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:03,084
Sometimes I feel no
one needs me anymore.

1361
01:41:03,417 --> 01:41:05,333
It's time for me to go.

1362
01:41:05,500 --> 01:41:08,459
Now you are over
reacting Rimadi.

1363
01:41:09,750 --> 01:41:11,625
Why think that way?

1364
01:41:11,792 --> 01:41:20,168
May be your daughter and
her husband are really busy.

1365
01:41:20,250 --> 01:41:25,667
Why get so upset?

1366
01:41:29,667 --> 01:41:31,876
I shouldn't have said it

1367
01:41:32,001 --> 01:41:33,168
I know Rimadi

1368
01:41:33,417 --> 01:41:35,792
I know you didn't
mean to be so rude.

1369
01:41:38,584 --> 01:41:41,667
I know.

1370
01:41:42,333 --> 01:41:46,750
Be steady. I'll go call Jayadi.

1371
01:41:48,209 --> 01:41:50,084
Be steady.

1372
01:42:26,084 --> 01:42:29,250
Why are you
sulking? Come let's go.

1373
01:42:29,584 --> 01:42:30,959
Come on.

1374
01:42:34,709 --> 01:42:36,542
No Paromita,

1375
01:42:37,250 --> 01:42:40,084
I am not sulking.

1376
01:42:41,001 --> 01:42:45,876
Actually what she
said was so true!

1377
01:42:49,168 --> 01:42:52,584
I really can't act.

1378
01:42:53,876 --> 01:42:58,250
But I wanted to be an actress.

1379
01:42:58,834 --> 01:43:02,625
Why Shakti Samanta...

1380
01:43:03,209 --> 01:43:05,917
No director ever approached me.

1381
01:43:08,625 --> 01:43:10,667
A pack of lies...

1382
01:43:11,209 --> 01:43:14,084
My very existence is a lie!

1383
01:43:21,168 --> 01:43:25,333
I made up the stories.

1384
01:43:26,500 --> 01:43:30,417
When I sit alone, I
think up all these stories

1385
01:43:30,584 --> 01:43:38,168
and imagine how others
will be fascinated by them.

1386
01:43:39,084 --> 01:43:43,876
Even if I can't be a heroine,
at least I can pretend to be one!

1387
01:43:46,500 --> 01:43:50,625
Rimadi, realized
the truth today.

1388
01:43:52,333 --> 01:43:55,042
Come no let's go,
we have to rehearse..

1389
01:43:55,625 --> 01:44:03,084
No no Paromita, I
can't do it any more...

1390
01:44:03,459 --> 01:44:08,292
I have lost everything.

1391
01:44:09,042 --> 01:44:13,667
My sons have left
me for my lies...

1392
01:44:14,667 --> 01:44:19,042
The daughters in
law have insulted me,

1393
01:44:20,750 --> 01:44:24,417
Whatever happens
you have to do it..

1394
01:44:25,042 --> 01:44:27,792
You have to make
the lies become true!

1395
01:44:27,959 --> 01:44:30,250
No I won't be able to do it.

1396
01:44:30,500 --> 01:44:33,375
Come on.
- I won't make it, I can't….

1397
01:44:34,001 --> 01:44:35,709
Yes.

1398
01:44:37,417 --> 01:44:39,001
You can

1399
01:44:40,375 --> 01:44:42,333
I am with you...

1400
01:44:42,750 --> 01:44:45,834
Let the boys say what they want,

1401
01:44:46,168 --> 01:44:48,542
But if you can enact properly,

1402
01:44:49,126 --> 01:44:56,584
I too will never go to the
toilet with the door open.

1403
01:45:06,168 --> 01:45:12,168
All of us have
some fear within us.

1404
01:45:15,959 --> 01:45:25,292
You have kept up your
ambition for so many years.

1405
01:45:27,542 --> 01:45:33,209
Just as I have lived
with my bathroom phobia.

1406
01:45:37,084 --> 01:45:44,584
Remember, my
dad died in the toilet,

1407
01:45:46,667 --> 01:45:50,750
And the door was shut!

1408
01:46:10,592 --> 01:46:11,509
Hello?

1409
01:46:30,092 --> 01:46:31,968
Come fast!

1410
01:46:33,884 --> 01:46:35,425
Mrs. Rima Chatterjee?
- Go inside.

1411
01:46:35,717 --> 01:46:37,467
Come, come.

1412
01:46:40,175 --> 01:46:41,968
Was it massive?

1413
01:46:42,801 --> 01:46:44,342
No, it was mild.

1414
01:46:44,550 --> 01:46:46,676
But it was so sudden…

1415
01:46:46,759 --> 01:46:48,550
Will you shift her
to a nursing home?

1416
01:46:48,968 --> 01:46:52,717
I thought I would, but I
don't think it's necessary.

1417
01:46:53,175 --> 01:46:55,092
She's practically alright.

1418
01:46:56,092 --> 01:46:58,259
But I have to change
her medication.

1419
01:46:58,509 --> 01:46:59,759
Stay for a while and talk.

1420
01:46:59,842 --> 01:47:01,092
I'll send someone.

1421
01:47:01,425 --> 01:47:03,842
Oh. So the danger
period is over?

1422
01:47:04,133 --> 01:47:05,884
Yes it's over!

1423
01:47:06,175 --> 01:47:07,050
You can talk.

1424
01:47:07,217 --> 01:47:10,175
I'll take it from
here, Dr.Sinha.

1425
01:47:16,050 --> 01:47:19,342
Ma, have some sweets.

1426
01:47:19,509 --> 01:47:20,509
No.

1427
01:47:21,259 --> 01:47:22,509
Just a little!

1428
01:47:22,842 --> 01:47:24,801
She talks about you all a lot.

1429
01:47:25,133 --> 01:47:27,676
She is crazy about
her granddaughters.

1430
01:47:28,217 --> 01:47:29,509
We've made a mistake.

1431
01:47:30,425 --> 01:47:34,509
We shouldn't have
left you like this.

1432
01:47:35,342 --> 01:47:37,467
If the heart attack was massive,

1433
01:47:37,968 --> 01:47:40,009
we wouldn't have even met you.

1434
01:47:40,717 --> 01:47:47,676
It's true. Since last night he was
afraid that he wouldn't see you again.

1435
01:47:48,592 --> 01:47:51,133
Ma, you are in pain, aren't you?
- She isn't now.

1436
01:47:51,384 --> 01:47:54,009
She's fine at the moment.

1437
01:47:54,175 --> 01:47:56,050
You'll go home,
won't you Rima Di?

1438
01:47:56,259 --> 01:47:59,384
No, no, I'm fine here.

1439
01:47:59,634 --> 01:48:03,050
Actually their
house is too small.

1440
01:48:03,217 --> 01:48:04,592
Only 3 rooms.

1441
01:48:05,009 --> 01:48:08,175
If I'm around, it's
a huge problem.

1442
01:48:08,342 --> 01:48:10,717
They can't have friends over.

1443
01:48:10,842 --> 01:48:13,717
Ma, I will never say it again.

1444
01:48:14,467 --> 01:48:15,550
Please come.

1445
01:48:16,092 --> 01:48:19,259
She's your mother. Tell her.

1446
01:48:20,300 --> 01:48:24,676
Yes Ma. We were wrong.

1447
01:48:25,133 --> 01:48:29,384
We'll stay together
in our 3 rooms.

1448
01:48:29,884 --> 01:48:33,634
Riya and Reempa
have really missed you.

1449
01:48:34,634 --> 01:48:36,759
Please come.

1450
01:48:36,884 --> 01:48:40,425
No, I'm fine.

1451
01:48:40,884 --> 01:48:44,926
It's the distance that
has made you rush here!

1452
01:48:46,425 --> 01:48:48,509
Thank God I had a heart attack.

1453
01:48:48,676 --> 01:48:51,217
I'm here!

1454
01:48:51,384 --> 01:48:53,175
The screw driver is
ready. Who wants some?

1455
01:48:53,259 --> 01:48:54,384
Rima?

1456
01:48:55,842 --> 01:48:57,592
Paromita?

1457
01:48:59,634 --> 01:49:01,175
What's wrong?

1458
01:49:01,592 --> 01:49:03,425
Nothing.

1459
01:49:03,717 --> 01:49:05,842
What are you doing?

1460
01:49:09,425 --> 01:49:12,050
You finished it?

1461
01:49:13,384 --> 01:49:15,759
It was so good. Thank you.

1462
01:49:15,842 --> 01:49:18,175
What happened? Nothing.
She had a mild attack.

1463
01:49:18,259 --> 01:49:20,926
Now it's over… Out of danger…

1464
01:49:20,968 --> 01:49:23,884
Why are you
pushing? I'll tell you…

1465
01:49:25,634 --> 01:49:28,384
Take a picture of Me with Ma.

1466
01:49:28,717 --> 01:49:30,050
Ofcourse.

1467
01:49:30,217 --> 01:49:34,175
Let it be. What's the need?

1468
01:49:34,425 --> 01:49:37,050
I'm still alive for a while.

1469
01:49:37,425 --> 01:49:41,759
Move and let them come
here. I want to chat with them.

1470
01:49:42,509 --> 01:49:44,926
Come here.
Grandma is calling you.

1471
01:49:45,133 --> 01:49:46,509
Riya, Reempa, come here.

1472
01:49:46,592 --> 01:49:51,092
Haven't seen you for so long…

1473
01:49:55,175 --> 01:49:56,217
Hey!

1474
01:49:56,342 --> 01:49:57,509
So sorry…

1475
01:49:59,926 --> 01:50:04,717
If you'd seen Anasuya
Di, you'd fall off your chair.

1476
01:50:05,759 --> 01:50:09,217
She had 2 screwdrivers
in her hands.

1477
01:50:09,342 --> 01:50:14,425
And Rima Di, with a supposed
heart attack lying on the bed.

1478
01:50:18,300 --> 01:50:22,634
And Rima Di's daughter,
son-in-law, grandchildren…

1479
01:50:24,050 --> 01:50:26,759
I thought it was all over.

1480
01:50:28,425 --> 01:50:31,425
So I gulped it…

1481
01:50:34,259 --> 01:50:36,259
Oh my!...

1482
01:50:40,217 --> 01:50:43,467
I think the heart attack
excuse was a bit much.

1483
01:50:43,550 --> 01:50:44,717
Shut up!

1484
01:50:45,550 --> 01:50:46,717
Hey!

1485
01:50:48,884 --> 01:50:52,550
They sent their mother here
so they could party at home.

1486
01:50:54,968 --> 01:50:58,717
Would they have come for
anything less than a heart attack?

1487
01:50:59,592 --> 01:51:05,259
Dr.Sinha I have
studied the human mind.

1488
01:51:06,884 --> 01:51:12,926
Life is all about a beautiful
sequence of self hypnotism.

1489
01:51:14,676 --> 01:51:17,884
The assurance of free will.

1490
01:51:19,926 --> 01:51:21,467
Take yourself as an example.

1491
01:51:23,092 --> 01:51:26,759
You have always
thought about Abhi.

1492
01:51:29,550 --> 01:51:33,509
But what about yourself?

1493
01:51:37,175 --> 01:51:39,676
Think about yourself.

1494
01:51:41,217 --> 01:51:44,676
Tanu left you long back,

1495
01:51:45,550 --> 01:51:48,217
And you're still
thinking about it.

1496
01:51:49,050 --> 01:51:50,342
Why?

1497
01:51:50,759 --> 01:51:53,592
Why won't you think
for yourself, Dr.Sinha?

1498
01:51:54,050 --> 01:51:56,926
Why won't you live for yourself?

1499
01:52:09,009 --> 01:52:10,634
Why had you called?

1500
01:52:11,717 --> 01:52:13,968
Wasn't getting
madam on the phone,

1501
01:52:14,133 --> 01:52:16,509
And an emergency
delivery had arrived.

1502
01:52:18,467 --> 01:52:19,926
Raxol? Whose is this?

1503
01:52:20,217 --> 01:52:22,842
Madam had ordered it.

1504
01:52:27,133 --> 01:52:28,801
Dr.Paromita Sen.

1505
01:52:33,050 --> 01:52:34,550
What's wrong?

1506
01:52:35,384 --> 01:52:36,467
Doctor?

1507
01:53:33,926 --> 01:53:35,217
Move!

1508
01:53:40,842 --> 01:53:41,884
What is this?

1509
01:53:48,217 --> 01:53:49,676
Get in the car.

1510
01:53:52,592 --> 01:53:53,842
Open the door!

1511
01:53:57,092 --> 01:53:58,425
Give her here.

1512
01:53:58,926 --> 01:54:00,968
What happened to
my granddaughter?

1513
01:54:06,467 --> 01:54:08,050
Let's go.

1514
01:54:22,717 --> 01:54:23,676
Who's that?

1515
01:54:23,842 --> 01:54:24,968
Who knows.

1516
01:54:31,509 --> 01:54:32,676
Namaste.

1517
01:54:40,717 --> 01:54:41,968
Ovarian cancer.

1518
01:54:44,259 --> 01:54:52,342
She found out a few days
after her fiancé, Anjan Da left.

1519
01:54:54,634 --> 01:54:58,092
She has removed
her ovaries and uterus.

1520
01:55:00,300 --> 01:55:02,467
The chemo worked
well for a while…

1521
01:55:04,509 --> 01:55:06,133
And then she came here.

1522
01:55:08,592 --> 01:55:10,634
And we lost contact.

1523
01:55:15,759 --> 01:55:19,676
Paromita Di never
wanted to cheat Anjan Da.

1524
01:55:21,759 --> 01:55:24,300
She knew that he
was a family guy.

1525
01:55:26,467 --> 01:55:30,217
A family, a home, a child…

1526
01:55:32,425 --> 01:55:34,801
That's why she could
never tell him the truth.

1527
01:55:36,384 --> 01:55:40,842
Actually she never
wanted sympathy.

1528
01:56:41,259 --> 01:56:43,592
If I could have got the
medicine 2 days back…

1529
01:56:44,175 --> 01:56:45,300
Atleast…

1530
01:56:45,926 --> 01:56:47,217
What is the doctor saying?

1531
01:56:47,759 --> 01:56:50,259
I can't believe it…

1532
01:56:51,092 --> 01:56:52,550
Paromita is…

1533
01:56:53,009 --> 01:56:55,342
And we are all…

1534
01:56:55,759 --> 01:56:56,759
What?

1535
01:56:57,092 --> 01:56:58,634
Dipankar Da?

1536
01:57:00,342 --> 01:57:03,384
I have got to know that.

1537
01:57:04,009 --> 01:57:12,926
My friend is no longer
on the same path,

1538
01:57:14,384 --> 01:57:16,634
I have understood…

1539
01:57:16,842 --> 01:57:21,009
Listen, can't we do
anything for Paromita?

1540
01:57:21,759 --> 01:57:26,259
It was her enthusiasm that
pushed this play forward.

1541
01:57:26,425 --> 01:57:28,509
I think we should…
- A play?

1542
01:57:31,842 --> 01:57:34,175
She played the
fool with you all.

1543
01:57:34,801 --> 01:57:37,384
She didn't treat
herself for 6 months.

1544
01:57:38,550 --> 01:57:41,717
She told all of
you to live life…

1545
01:57:44,467 --> 01:57:45,801
She told me too.

1546
01:57:46,634 --> 01:57:48,300
Live your life, doctor.

1547
01:57:50,133 --> 01:57:52,050
And in her own life she…

1548
01:57:53,133 --> 01:57:55,050
Is this a game?

1549
01:57:55,592 --> 01:57:58,217
To teach people
how to live and kill …

1550
01:57:59,759 --> 01:58:01,884
Then why did she have
to buy the medicine?

1551
01:58:02,759 --> 01:58:05,342
Dr.Sinha, Paromita
Di wanted to live again.

1552
01:58:07,425 --> 01:58:13,217
She called me and said
that she wanted to try again.

1553
01:58:14,467 --> 01:58:18,300
I don't know why, but
Paromita Di loves me very much.

1554
01:58:19,926 --> 01:58:22,467
That's why she
tells me everything.

1555
01:58:29,676 --> 01:58:30,550
Hello?

1556
01:58:31,050 --> 01:58:32,509
Dr.Sinha here.

1557
01:58:33,717 --> 01:58:35,092
Yes, of course.

1558
01:58:37,217 --> 01:58:38,634
Dr.Roy?

1559
01:58:39,217 --> 01:58:41,259
How is the patient?

1560
01:59:01,075 --> 01:59:02,242
Apu!

1561
01:59:03,592 --> 01:59:04,801
Coming.

1562
01:59:10,133 --> 01:59:11,384
Take this.

1563
01:59:12,259 --> 01:59:13,801
Give it to her.

1564
01:59:16,842 --> 01:59:18,092
Won't you come?

1565
01:59:19,717 --> 01:59:20,550
No.

1566
01:59:21,050 --> 01:59:22,300
You all go.

1567
01:59:23,634 --> 01:59:25,509
I'll wait.

1568
01:59:26,968 --> 01:59:27,926
Go.

1569
01:59:30,926 --> 01:59:32,550
Everybody please get in.

1570
01:59:52,951 --> 02:00:00,242
We come and then
we are swept away,

1571
02:00:00,884 --> 02:00:05,175
We come and then
we are swept away,

1572
02:00:07,509 --> 02:00:10,009
Going away means
reaching somewhere else...

1573
02:00:10,384 --> 02:00:13,217
The way you brought
everyone into the stream of life...

1574
02:00:13,425 --> 02:00:18,926
Similarly you will emerge from
darkness into hope and return...
