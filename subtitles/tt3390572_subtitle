1
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,211
Mother! Oh mother!!

2
00:02:20,267 --> 00:02:22,645
Hang on... Commander...

3
00:02:31,933 --> 00:02:33,412
Mother!

4
00:02:41,033 --> 00:02:43,013
It's a case of severe appendicitis.

5
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,106
We need to operate immediately.

6
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:50,109
He is the face of our movement.

7
00:02:50,933 --> 00:02:53,311
We cannot risk going to the hospital.

8
00:02:53,533 --> 00:02:56,036
We will have to
take the risk, Zahoor.

9
00:02:57,233 --> 00:02:59,611
Or tomorrow the press will report...

10
00:02:59,867 --> 00:03:01,312
that Commander Ikhlaq Latif died...

11
00:03:01,367 --> 00:03:04,246
of a terrifying explosion
of his appendix.

12
00:03:06,533 --> 00:03:11,175
I'll arrange an ambulance and
will meet you by the lake in an hour.

13
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,871
Where will you operate?

14
00:03:16,133 --> 00:03:17,305
At home.

15
00:03:44,067 --> 00:03:45,307
- "What is a home?"

16
00:03:45,533 --> 00:03:48,537
"It is brothers and sisters..."
- And sisters.

17
00:03:49,233 --> 00:03:52,271
"And fathers and mothers."
- And mothers.

18
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:58,045
"It is unselfish acts and kindly sharing."
- Sharing.

19
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:02,014
"And showing your loved ones
you're always caring..."

20
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:03,375
- Caring.

21
00:04:03,967 --> 00:04:05,913
"What is a house?"

22
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,105
Doctor, how are you?
- I am fine.

23
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,837
- You got delayed today...
- Another surgery.

24
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:21,147
Let the doctor go...

25
00:04:40,467 --> 00:04:42,879
Lower the heat a bit...

26
00:04:47,467 --> 00:04:49,037
And the flames within you...

27
00:04:57,467 --> 00:04:59,777
They can burn this house down!

28
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:05,444
You'll have the
village burnt to ashes.

29
00:05:08,367 --> 00:05:11,075
Doctor...
- Yes.

30
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,712
Do you know what you're doing?

31
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,713
Exactly what a doctor
should be doing.

32
00:05:22,967 --> 00:05:24,708
Which side are you on?

33
00:05:27,367 --> 00:05:29,870
I am for life.

34
00:06:43,033 --> 00:06:43,807
- Move.

35
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,247
Salam Alaikum! This is Gul Khan.

36
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,179
It's a cordon and search operation.

37
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:05,750
Every man and boy is ordered to assemble
in the school grounds immediately.

38
00:07:06,133 --> 00:07:10,138
Women and children may stay home.

39
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,204
It's a cordon and search operation.

40
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:19,878
Every man and boy is ordered to assemble
in the school grounds immediately.

41
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:24,007
Hilaal!
There's a crackdown in our village.

42
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,682
Every man and boy is ordered to assemble
in the school grounds immediately.

43
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,302
- This crackdown may go on all day...

44
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:49,640
This before meals, this afterwards.

45
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,941
If the pain gets worse, inject this.

46
00:08:18,867 --> 00:08:19,902
Be careful...

47
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:23,841
If they suspect something...

48
00:08:24,033 --> 00:08:25,239
no one will survive.

49
00:08:25,667 --> 00:08:26,975
Neither you...

50
00:08:27,167 --> 00:08:28,544
nor I...

51
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:35,546
And Haider?

52
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:43,909
God is his guardian.

53
00:08:45,167 --> 00:08:47,875
He will take care of him...

54
00:09:57,133 --> 00:09:59,977
- Save me... Oh, Lord!

55
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:01,740
- I don't know!!

56
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,046
- Ikhlaq Latif...

57
00:10:56,033 --> 00:10:57,103
Surrender yourself...

58
00:11:00,433 --> 00:11:05,348
- Indian law will give you a fair trial.

59
00:11:11,033 --> 00:11:13,843
Lay down your weapons
and come out.

60
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,743
- You don't have a chance.

61
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,708
Surrender or die.

62
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,310
Sir... Ikhlaq Latif is alive...

63
00:12:29,367 --> 00:12:30,710
We have killed the
other two millitants.

64
00:12:30,767 --> 00:12:32,371
Shall we send in reinforcements?

65
00:12:32,433 --> 00:12:35,312
No bloody militant
dead or alive...

66
00:12:36,367 --> 00:12:38,779
is worth my soldier's life...

67
00:12:40,567 --> 00:12:42,638
In the name of Allah
most merciful...

68
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,338
- Load...

69
00:13:02,867 --> 00:13:03,902
Ready...

70
00:13:11,433 --> 00:13:12,309
Fire!

71
00:14:21,467 --> 00:14:25,210
Everybody line up outside
with your IDs and bags.

72
00:14:43,733 --> 00:14:44,768
Where are you going?

73
00:14:45,367 --> 00:14:46,311
Srinagar.

74
00:14:46,433 --> 00:14:48,606
You are coming from?
- Aligarh.

75
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,179
What do you do there?

76
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,504
I'm a student.

77
00:14:51,567 --> 00:14:52,602
College ID?

78
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,546
Subject of research?

79
00:15:04,067 --> 00:15:06,809
Revolutionary poets of British India.

80
00:15:07,467 --> 00:15:09,310
Which town do you belong to?

81
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,778
Islamabad.

82
00:15:17,067 --> 00:15:18,740
- The captain is out at the check post...

83
00:15:19,367 --> 00:15:21,074
Any message for him?

84
00:15:32,467 --> 00:15:33,537
Salam Alaikum!

85
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,240
Come.

86
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:48,177
- Sir, I want to interview you...

87
00:15:48,233 --> 00:15:49,576
Go ahead... interview me now...

88
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,270
Ah, thanks!

89
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:52,741
So...

90
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:08,274
I'll thrash you!

91
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:12,547
Your love for Kashmir...
is expressed as Islamabad?

92
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:13,577
What?

93
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,612
Sir, Islamabad is another name
for Anantnag.

94
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,043
I know.

95
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,704
But for us...
there's just one Islamabad.

96
00:16:23,267 --> 00:16:24,541
In Pakistan...

97
00:16:25,367 --> 00:16:27,472
Nice poems

98
00:16:27,633 --> 00:16:29,112
Rather difficult though.

99
00:16:29,567 --> 00:16:33,640
Be careful with such beautiful inspiration.

100
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,202
Okay?
Take this.

101
00:16:38,733 --> 00:16:43,148
Haider, that burrito
wouldn't budge.

102
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,044
I told him that you are a poet,
not a militant.

103
00:16:48,033 --> 00:16:49,706
And we are engaged to be married.

104
00:16:49,767 --> 00:16:51,212
He wanted proof.

105
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,112
I told him to read your diary.

106
00:16:54,167 --> 00:16:56,010
You wrote your poems for me...

107
00:16:56,067 --> 00:16:57,205
since childhood.

108
00:17:01,133 --> 00:17:02,271
Where are we going?

109
00:17:02,567 --> 00:17:03,944
To see your mother.

110
00:17:04,133 --> 00:17:05,134
Where is she?

111
00:17:05,433 --> 00:17:07,037
At your uncle's.

112
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,644
Stop the car.

113
00:17:15,633 --> 00:17:17,306
I have to go home.

114
00:17:23,533 --> 00:17:24,671
Haider...

115
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:32,381
There isn't much of a home
left in what remains...

116
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,175
Father, wait...

117
00:19:00,967 --> 00:19:03,174
I'm running late...
- Won't take long...

118
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:28,045
Let the petals fill with colour...

119
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:34,016
Let the breeze ruffle the spring...

120
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:40,549
Let the breeze ruffle the spring.

121
00:19:40,967 --> 00:19:41,945
The next verse?

122
00:19:43,133 --> 00:19:47,946
Let the breeze ruffle the spring...

123
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,174
Come along, my love...
Awake the garden to life.

124
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,041
There... the vase has fallen...

125
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,979
That's my bat.

126
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,039
Hold this.

127
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,002
Dad's shoes...

128
00:20:59,067 --> 00:21:00,740
Haider...
- Yes.

129
00:21:02,967 --> 00:21:05,208
Don't fight it...

130
00:21:06,267 --> 00:21:07,473
What?

131
00:21:09,267 --> 00:21:10,439
You can on]...

132
00:21:12,167 --> 00:21:14,044
Where's the shoe brush?

133
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,873
Haider...

134
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,208
You can on]...

135
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,779
Please.

136
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,212
What is Arshee's car doing here?

137
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:50,473
Slop!

138
00:22:10,033 --> 00:22:12,673
Now that is quite an interview!

139
00:22:13,733 --> 00:22:14,734
Brother...

140
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,303
Of course, you couldn't
drop me at the airport

141
00:22:17,367 --> 00:22:19,142
You don't get it...

142
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,770
Don't say a word!

143
00:22:23,933 --> 00:22:24,843
- Brother...

144
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,001
Listen...

145
00:22:27,367 --> 00:22:30,007
If I ever see you around her...

146
00:22:30,067 --> 00:22:31,978
you will disappear...

147
00:22:32,033 --> 00:22:33,171
just like your father.

148
00:22:33,233 --> 00:22:35,008
You get me? Like your...

149
00:22:40,033 --> 00:22:41,307
Arshee, move aside.

150
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,402
Leave us! Please.

151
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,975
- Come with me.

152
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,044
- Let go of my hand.

153
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,135
Come with me.

154
00:23:01,933 --> 00:23:03,708
- You never heard my caution.

155
00:23:04,067 --> 00:23:06,240
You let her do as she pleases.

156
00:23:06,733 --> 00:23:08,644
And look now.

157
00:23:12,633 --> 00:23:14,635
She won't leave the house.

158
00:23:18,367 --> 00:23:20,108
I will not stop working.

159
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,304
- What did you say?

160
00:23:24,367 --> 00:23:26,313
Look at me.
What did you say?

161
00:23:26,367 --> 00:23:28,040
Alright, calm down.

162
00:23:30,667 --> 00:23:33,807
You have to stop seeing Haider.

163
00:23:36,633 --> 00:23:37,976
Lucky is right about it.

164
00:23:39,633 --> 00:23:42,807
His life won't be the same
after the doctor's arrest.

165
00:23:42,867 --> 00:23:46,906
The families of militants
can neither get passports...

166
00:23:47,667 --> 00:23:50,273
nor government jobs.

167
00:23:51,233 --> 00:23:53,213
You know how it is.

168
00:23:53,633 --> 00:23:55,977
Yes. Very well...

169
00:23:58,233 --> 00:23:59,906
See what I mean?

170
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,880
She is a stubborn one...

171
00:24:08,633 --> 00:24:09,839
Swear by the Koran.

172
00:24:12,067 --> 00:24:13,671
Place your hand on it.

173
00:24:17,033 --> 00:24:18,068
Arshee...

174
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,808
Arshee...

175
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,802
Open the door.

176
00:24:25,133 --> 00:24:26,544
Arshee...

177
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,306
There's another flight
to Bangalore at two.

178
00:24:31,533 --> 00:24:32,910
I don't want to go.

179
00:24:32,933 --> 00:24:34,674
Don't be a fool.

180
00:24:34,733 --> 00:24:35,973
"Don't want to go..."

181
00:24:37,067 --> 00:24:39,274
You don't turn down such a big job.

182
00:24:39,533 --> 00:24:41,137
Don't take it lightly.

183
00:24:42,133 --> 00:24:43,874
She has the mind of a child...

184
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,143
- I'll speak to her.

185
00:24:48,667 --> 00:24:50,738
Here... I swear by the Koran...

186
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,670
Thank you.

187
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,975
Good to see you...

188
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,408
Why are you laughing?

189
00:26:36,734 --> 00:26:37,712
Sorry!

190
00:26:38,767 --> 00:26:41,611
You are so out of tune.

191
00:26:42,433 --> 00:26:45,107
I have been
begging you to teach me

192
00:26:45,167 --> 00:26:47,169
Since college...

193
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,437
Teach me.

194
00:26:49,634 --> 00:26:51,409
Be my master.

195
00:26:51,667 --> 00:26:54,011
And you look away.

196
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,780
I'll have to sing like this now...

197
00:26:59,933 --> 00:27:01,469
Why don't you?

198
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,477
Please.
- No.

199
00:27:04,533 --> 00:27:07,639
Darling sis-in-law.

200
00:27:52,433 --> 00:27:53,434
My angel...

201
00:27:54,033 --> 00:27:55,637
Haider!

202
00:27:58,434 --> 00:27:59,378
You are home!

203
00:27:59,433 --> 00:28:00,969
Not a word of your arrival...

204
00:28:21,933 --> 00:28:25,005
You've lost so much weight...

205
00:28:26,433 --> 00:28:28,003
- Grown a beard too...

206
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,941
Have you...

207
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,380
written your thesis?

208
00:28:45,567 --> 00:28:47,569
Why are you so quiet?

209
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,309
Say something?

210
00:28:57,567 --> 00:28:59,012
My angel...

211
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:10,939
- These are hard times.

212
00:29:11,367 --> 00:29:13,973
It's a time for patience.

213
00:29:14,533 --> 00:29:15,978
The Koran tells us.

214
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,980
- God is with the patient.

215
00:29:19,834 --> 00:29:22,246
I've filed a petition in court

216
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,741
It will take some time...

217
00:29:30,467 --> 00:29:32,606
God-willing, all will be well soon.

218
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,645
It doesn't look like it though.

219
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,638
What?

220
00:29:44,467 --> 00:29:47,346
The two of you seem quite happy...

221
00:29:47,567 --> 00:29:49,774
with my father's disappearance.

222
00:29:52,467 --> 00:29:53,411
What?

223
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,410
The two of you seem very happy...

224
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,280
with my father's disappearance.

225
00:29:59,967 --> 00:30:01,275
- Haider...

226
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:04,413
Have you lost it?

227
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,643
What are you saying?

228
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:09,574
Exactly what I see...

229
00:30:09,634 --> 00:30:10,612
dear uncle...

230
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:17,474
Has your musical been on for a while?

231
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,973
Or did this romantic production begin..

232
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,743
After father's disappearance?

233
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,478
Sis-in-law...

234
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,645
How dare you!

235
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,906
Is this the way to talk to your mother?

236
00:30:38,534 --> 00:30:40,445
Is this what you learnt in college?

237
00:30:40,633 --> 00:30:41,236
- Sis-in-law...

238
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,803
Let his father return!

239
00:30:43,867 --> 00:30:44,902
He's a boy...

240
00:30:45,433 --> 00:30:46,503
Let it be...

241
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,338
It will affect your health...

242
00:30:48,367 --> 00:30:50,210
Come along...

243
00:30:51,733 --> 00:30:53,212
Sis-in-law...

244
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,435
Haider...

245
00:30:56,467 --> 00:30:57,912
I am sorry.

246
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:08,240
Haider... I will explain...

247
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,674
Sis-in-law...

248
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,338
My angel...

249
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,141
Sis-in-law...

250
00:31:24,667 --> 00:31:25,873
Haider...

251
00:31:26,367 --> 00:31:28,779
Come back...
It is time for curfew now.

252
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:30,878
My angel...

253
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,641
The army will grab him too.

254
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,576
Please! Stop him!

255
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,170
He will be fine.

256
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,474
Please get him back.

257
00:31:38,533 --> 00:31:40,513
Sis-in-law...

258
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:42,573
I'll manage it...

259
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,906
Don't worn].

260
00:32:20,634 --> 00:32:22,375
Hello!

261
00:32:22,434 --> 00:32:24,209
Whom do you want?

262
00:32:24,267 --> 00:32:25,769
Salman?
Just a moment.

263
00:32:25,834 --> 00:32:27,245
Telephone.

264
00:32:29,467 --> 00:32:32,471
Hello!
Whom do you want?

265
00:32:33,167 --> 00:32:34,544
This call is for you.

266
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,610
Hello...

267
00:32:51,467 --> 00:32:52,810
Whom do you want?

268
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,406
Salman or Salman?

269
00:32:54,434 --> 00:32:56,175
Or Salmanl?

270
00:32:57,667 --> 00:32:58,805
Do you mind taking the trouble...

271
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,374
to introduce yourself?

272
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,535
Your daddy!

273
00:33:02,567 --> 00:33:04,171
Superintendent of Police...

274
00:33:04,234 --> 00:33:05,269
Pan/ez Lone

275
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,611
Sir... Sorry sir!

276
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,638
Pan/ez sir...

277
00:33:18,134 --> 00:33:19,374
- Hello sir...

278
00:33:19,433 --> 00:33:22,346
Do we pay you to sing and dance?

279
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:24,305
I apologise, sir!

280
00:33:24,567 --> 00:33:26,171
Do you know Haider?

281
00:33:26,467 --> 00:33:27,377
<i>Haider Meet.</i>

282
00:33:27,433 --> 00:33:29,037
Yes sir! I know him very well.

283
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,306
We did high school together.

284
00:33:30,367 --> 00:33:31,437
- Find him!

285
00:33:32,033 --> 00:33:33,478
You'll find him around the lake...

286
00:33:34,667 --> 00:33:36,408
Take him home
to keep an eye on him...

287
00:33:36,467 --> 00:33:37,571
Yes, sir!

288
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:39,468
Have a good day...

289
00:33:41,233 --> 00:33:43,577
You rascal! Didn't I tell you...

290
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,479
to disconnect the phone before
brother Salman's movie.

291
00:33:47,534 --> 00:33:49,639
- No... not that.
- Want some of this?!

292
00:33:52,433 --> 00:33:53,673
Do you want some of this?

293
00:34:04,533 --> 00:34:05,409
Slop!

294
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,444
Where are you going?

295
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,410
What's in the bag?

296
00:34:07,467 --> 00:34:08,468
Check it...
- Yes, sir.

297
00:34:08,533 --> 00:34:09,409
Your identity card?

298
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,111
And raise your hands...
Frisk him...

299
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,376
Hello Captain.

300
00:34:19,434 --> 00:34:20,936
Salman...

301
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,569
and Salman!

302
00:34:21,667 --> 00:34:22,668
Hello Major!

303
00:34:22,933 --> 00:34:24,276
Haider... How are you?

304
00:34:24,334 --> 00:34:26,211
When did you get back?
- You know him?

305
00:34:27,134 --> 00:34:28,613
Know him?!

306
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:32,974
He's my sweetheart

307
00:34:33,267 --> 00:34:36,714
Come on, let's get out of here
before curfew sets in.

308
00:34:37,167 --> 00:34:39,579
Or some Major will be welcoming us...

309
00:34:39,633 --> 00:34:41,010
in a military camp.

310
00:34:41,967 --> 00:34:43,139
Let me carry the bag.

311
00:34:43,267 --> 00:34:44,507
Haider, come.

312
00:34:46,434 --> 00:34:48,004
Goodbye, Colonel.

313
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,005
Seated?

314
00:34:51,067 --> 00:34:52,205
Let's go.

315
00:34:58,933 --> 00:35:01,641
In Kashmir, God in heaven...

316
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,573
and the army rules the earth.

317
00:35:03,633 --> 00:35:05,408
- And the army has a bible...

318
00:35:05,467 --> 00:35:07,071
AFS PA

319
00:35:08,433 --> 00:35:10,310
The Armed Forces Special Power Act.

320
00:35:10,367 --> 00:35:14,281
Khurram, my son is innocent.

321
00:35:14,567 --> 00:35:17,343
He's been detained
at the Faraz cinema camp.

322
00:35:17,434 --> 00:35:19,607
Please get him out.

323
00:35:21,867 --> 00:35:23,403
Uncle...

324
00:35:26,033 --> 00:35:28,946
I have no authority...

325
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,536
to free your boy.

326
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,880
I can't get him out...

327
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,480
but I can possibly save his life.

328
00:35:38,967 --> 00:35:42,039
We have to shift him from
a camp to a prison.

329
00:35:43,267 --> 00:35:45,941
We need to get him charged...

330
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,004
with a crime.

331
00:35:48,067 --> 00:35:49,876
- Sir.
- It'll be a false charge.

332
00:35:49,933 --> 00:35:51,378
A false charge.

333
00:35:52,167 --> 00:35:54,078
That would get him
a court hearing.

334
00:35:54,434 --> 00:35:59,281
Meaning...
no chances of dissapearance...

335
00:36:01,434 --> 00:36:02,538
- Okay?

336
00:36:10,867 --> 00:36:14,076
C-H-U-T-Z-P-A-H..

337
00:36:14,834 --> 00:36:16,814
Chutzpah...

338
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,911
It is what it is.

339
00:36:19,234 --> 00:36:20,212
Chutzpah?

340
00:36:20,367 --> 00:36:21,368
What is it?

341
00:36:21,534 --> 00:36:27,246
Once a boy was arrested
for the murder of his parents.

342
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:34,008
In the courtroom he sought...

343
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:38,174
a lenient sentence from the judge.

344
00:36:39,067 --> 00:36:40,512
Bewildered, the judge asked...

345
00:36:41,167 --> 00:36:43,443
How do you expect mercy...

346
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:47,076
after killing your own parents?

347
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,211
The boy replied...

348
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:54,546
Because I am an orphan now.

349
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,837
That my friends is chutzpah.

350
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,846
A Hebrew word.

351
00:37:03,067 --> 00:37:06,207
- It does rhyme a bit with AFSPA...

352
00:37:09,334 --> 00:37:11,473
- And similar in meaning too.

353
00:37:11,867 --> 00:37:12,845
AFSPA...

354
00:37:13,133 --> 00:37:14,043
Chutzpah...

355
00:37:15,067 --> 00:37:17,138
Chutzpah...
- AFSPA...

356
00:37:21,133 --> 00:37:22,339
- What will you do now?

357
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,073
The same.

358
00:37:24,134 --> 00:37:25,340
Chutzpah!

359
00:37:30,134 --> 00:37:32,273
I'll look for my father.

360
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,379
Where? In camps?

361
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,174
In prisons?

362
00:37:42,934 --> 00:37:45,881
All of Kashmir is a prison.

363
00:37:47,167 --> 00:37:48,441
I will look for him everywhere.

364
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:08,079
Jhelum, Jhelum, searching a shore

365
00:38:08,267 --> 00:38:14,707
Jhelum, Jhelum, searching a shore

366
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:24,374
Jhelum, Jhelum, searching a shore

367
00:38:24,767 --> 00:38:30,217
Jhelum, Jhelum, searching a shore

368
00:38:38,067 --> 00:38:44,814
In whose eyes the sun sets

369
00:38:44,867 --> 00:38:50,715
The sun sets in whose eyes

370
00:38:50,767 --> 00:38:57,742
The waters of the river Jhelum
Have turned saline

371
00:39:00,634 --> 00:39:06,107
Jhelum, Jhelum, searching a shore

372
00:39:07,134 --> 00:39:14,052
Jhelum, Jhelum, searching a shore

373
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:56,349
Who to ask for how much longer

374
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:02,175
This pain we must continue to bear

375
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:09,609
Holding the hand of the blinded night

376
00:40:09,667 --> 00:40:14,810
We must walk yet how much longer

377
00:40:20,634 --> 00:40:26,915
Blood, blood, blood,
blood has become the colour of time

378
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:33,346
Blood, blood, blood,
blood has become the colour of time

379
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,744
Blood, blood, blood

380
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:39,279
Blood is a moulten ember

381
00:40:39,334 --> 00:40:41,075
Blood is a moulten ember

382
00:40:41,133 --> 00:40:42,737
- God! Oh God!

383
00:40:42,934 --> 00:40:43,969
- I'm still alive...

384
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,772
- Thank you, Oh Lord! I am still alive!

385
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:41,145
- Gentlemen

386
00:41:41,634 --> 00:41:43,875
- Delhi has approved Operation Nightingale.

387
00:41:44,134 --> 00:41:47,308
We have complete support to
arm, fund and run...

388
00:41:47,834 --> 00:41:50,542
the counter insurgency force...

389
00:41:50,767 --> 00:41:51,802
- Complete support!

390
00:41:51,867 --> 00:41:54,143
The enemy's foes are our friends...

391
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,113
Any individual or group...

392
00:41:57,167 --> 00:42:00,011
anyone with a grudge against...

393
00:42:00,067 --> 00:42:02,741
the Hizbul Mujahideen and
Pakistan's proxy war...

394
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,610
surrendered militants,
detainees, undenrials...

395
00:42:05,834 --> 00:42:07,541
- will be our primary recruits.

396
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,841
<i>Khwan-m-Mukhbireen</i>

397
00:42:11,767 --> 00:42:15,544
The Army will run the operation
but your support will be crucial...

398
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,807
in recruitment and intelligence.

399
00:42:18,767 --> 00:42:20,940
Let the Nightingale start singing.

400
00:42:22,033 --> 00:42:23,603
It' s catch and kill.

401
00:42:23,667 --> 00:42:25,544
- We need to nourish the Ikhwan

402
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,546
<i>khwan-m-Mukhbireen ..</i>

403
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:31,876
With arms, money, power...

404
00:42:33,534 --> 00:42:35,241
Isn't that Kaul's house?

405
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,639
- Yes, he's in Jammu,
in a refugee camp.

406
00:42:38,234 --> 00:42:41,044
I think he's moved to Bombay...

407
00:42:44,967 --> 00:42:48,176
How many cases do you have?

408
00:42:48,534 --> 00:42:50,536
About 75-80.

409
00:42:51,667 --> 00:42:57,515
But why would they take up arms
against their own?

410
00:42:58,134 --> 00:42:59,613
For freedom...

411
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,877
A prisoner will exchange
anything for his freedom.

412
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:12,475
Pan/ez...

413
00:43:12,534 --> 00:43:13,569
What...

414
00:43:15,434 --> 00:43:16,174
What do we get?

415
00:43:17,767 --> 00:43:19,769
Delhi.

416
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,570
Take them away.

417
00:43:31,867 --> 00:43:34,575
A dead militant is worth
a hundred thousand rupees.

418
00:43:35,767 --> 00:43:37,075
Call the media.
- Yes, sir!

419
00:43:43,533 --> 00:43:45,012
Haider...

420
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,511
Hear me out...

421
00:43:57,167 --> 00:43:58,077
Who...

422
00:43:59,567 --> 00:44:00,944
Who are you angn/ with?

423
00:44:01,734 --> 00:44:02,576
And why?

424
00:44:02,634 --> 00:44:05,342
He's not just your father,
but my brother too...

425
00:44:05,467 --> 00:44:06,775
my only brother...

426
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:07,671
It's been...

427
00:44:10,434 --> 00:44:15,110
Days since your mother
managed a smile.

428
00:44:16,934 --> 00:44:19,642
She's been crying for weeks.

429
00:44:21,434 --> 00:44:24,472
And you accuse us of singing...

430
00:44:24,534 --> 00:44:26,673
and dancing in joy...

431
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,541
secretly?

432
00:44:28,934 --> 00:44:31,608
She is my brother's wife.

433
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,409
My dearest sister-in-law.

434
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,708
Haider...

435
00:44:42,067 --> 00:44:43,410
Here, take a look.

436
00:44:45,934 --> 00:44:47,675
I am contesting the elections.

437
00:44:47,767 --> 00:44:49,542
Do you know why?

438
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,445
Ask me why?

439
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,575
Why?
- For my brother.

440
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:58,345
What else!

441
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,707
Once I'm in power...

442
00:45:01,767 --> 00:45:05,715
I'll tear open even] prison
and bring him home.

443
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:09,906
Uncle, you may wait
for the elections.

444
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,807
My battle has already begun.

445
00:45:22,367 --> 00:45:24,040
"Armed Forces Special Powers Act,

446
00:45:24,334 --> 00:45:25,642
Rule 4 of section 5 says -

447
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:28,544
Any person taken under custody under
this Act shall be handed over...

448
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:33,015
to the office in charge of the nearest police
station with the least possible delay."

449
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,971
The least possible delay...

450
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:38,844
It's been twenty days and
there's no word of him.

451
00:45:40,967 --> 00:45:43,277
If everything worked by the book...

452
00:45:43,834 --> 00:45:45,575
do you think Kashmir would
have been the hell it is?

453
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,312
Pandit Nehru promised Kashmiris
a plebiscite with the world as his witness

454
00:45:50,367 --> 00:45:51,573
What happened?

455
00:45:51,733 --> 00:45:53,269
- Let aside plebiscite...

456
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:54,574
Even the first condition
to plebiscite...

457
00:45:54,767 --> 00:45:56,508
demilitarization...

458
00:45:56,567 --> 00:45:58,274
did not happen.

459
00:46:00,767 --> 00:46:03,976
When two elephants fight...

460
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,941
it is the grass
that is trampled upon.

461
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,702
I agree, uncle...

462
00:46:10,334 --> 00:46:11,972
But I want to file a formal report

463
00:46:14,867 --> 00:46:17,848
Don't mess with the army, son.

464
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:21,540
If you file a formal report...

465
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:24,479
the chances of finding him
will become even more bleak.

466
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:32,801
Rocky is good...

467
00:46:32,834 --> 00:46:34,211
But you are in India...

468
00:46:34,234 --> 00:46:35,645
Watch the Indian action hero...

469
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,509
Salman Khan...
Tell them...

470
00:46:37,867 --> 00:46:40,404
This film was...

471
00:46:40,667 --> 00:46:41,975
chutzpah!
- Yes.

472
00:46:42,434 --> 00:46:44,414
What is Chutzpah?

473
00:46:44,467 --> 00:46:46,777
It's a big film... a big hit.

474
00:46:46,867 --> 00:46:48,471
A blockbuster...

475
00:46:48,667 --> 00:46:50,544
Can I see it?
- Yes, sure.

476
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,944
Salman... Salman Khan.
- This guy?

477
00:47:02,767 --> 00:47:04,212
Are you done shooting?

478
00:47:04,267 --> 00:47:05,803
I'll eat...
- Come...

479
00:47:08,567 --> 00:47:10,513
Yes please...

480
00:47:11,367 --> 00:47:11,811
- Haider...

481
00:47:11,867 --> 00:47:14,541
- Eat some more...
- Haider...

482
00:47:14,667 --> 00:47:15,645
- Haider...

483
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:18,681
- I can't see a thing...

484
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,510
Salam Alaikum, uncle.

485
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,379
Princess...

486
00:47:30,534 --> 00:47:31,410
Where's your prince?

487
00:47:34,767 --> 00:47:36,337
Mister...

488
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,371
Your mother has been on a
hunger strike for two days now.

489
00:47:40,467 --> 00:47:46,816
She won't even touch water till
she she sees you.

490
00:47:54,334 --> 00:47:55,904
Open the door, sis-in-law!

491
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,746
I present to you
the sparkle of your eyes...

492
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,212
- your little prince.

493
00:48:13,267 --> 00:48:14,473
My angel...

494
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:20,576
You know, if you go to Delhi...

495
00:48:20,634 --> 00:48:22,614
you'll easily get a job.

496
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,076
Where?

497
00:48:24,434 --> 00:48:26,107
The National School of Drama.

498
00:48:28,067 --> 00:48:30,104
Please do stop your theatrics now!

499
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,170
What do you mean?

500
00:48:34,634 --> 00:48:35,772
Why am I to blame?

501
00:48:36,834 --> 00:48:38,404
Emotional blackmail...

502
00:48:39,067 --> 00:48:40,637
ever since my childhood...

503
00:48:41,534 --> 00:48:44,071
you would stop eating or leave home.

504
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,381
You would cry away
or threaten suicude.

505
00:48:47,733 --> 00:48:50,805
That is how you sent me
away to Aligarh.

506
00:48:51,234 --> 00:48:52,770
Banished me from my home...

507
00:48:54,234 --> 00:48:55,440
away from my father...

508
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,344
If I hadn't pushed you to Aligarh...

509
00:49:14,334 --> 00:49:17,213
you know well, where you
would have ended up!

510
00:49:37,567 --> 00:49:38,511
What is this?

511
00:49:42,034 --> 00:49:43,513
Where did you get this from?

512
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:47,078
I demand an answer.

513
00:49:47,134 --> 00:49:49,273
It belongs to a friend.

514
00:49:49,334 --> 00:49:51,143
I'll return it tomorrow.

515
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,476
Ah, now you are friends
with militants?

516
00:49:57,134 --> 00:50:00,206
It's a pistol today,
tomorrow it will be a Kalashnikov...

517
00:50:02,567 --> 00:50:04,069
Going for arms training in Pakistan?

518
00:50:04,134 --> 00:50:05,272
Are you?!

519
00:50:05,333 --> 00:50:08,109
Yes, I'll go across.

520
00:50:17,034 --> 00:50:18,012
Sis-in-law...

521
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,201
Are you alright?

522
00:50:36,434 --> 00:50:38,414
- These are dark days.

523
00:50:38,633 --> 00:50:42,046
Birds of prey circle above...

524
00:50:43,067 --> 00:50:47,038
They prey without care...

525
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:53,145
Kites grab sparrows and
falcons feast on Nightingales...

526
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,407
- Keep him away from it all...

527
00:50:56,034 --> 00:50:57,411
I have a friend
at the university in Aligarh.

528
00:50:57,467 --> 00:50:59,413
Send him there.

529
00:51:00,034 --> 00:51:03,311
- Let him see the other side of India.

530
00:51:03,367 --> 00:51:08,373
A world without imprisoned days
and curfews at nights.

531
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,971
Doctor Sahib won't let him go.

532
00:51:12,434 --> 00:51:15,176
I'll take care of the doctor.

533
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,606
- Make Haider come around.

534
00:51:16,667 --> 00:51:17,509
Alright?

535
00:51:18,667 --> 00:51:21,238
Now cheer up...

536
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:24,080
Smile, my child!

537
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:31,712
This house is a ruin
without your laughter.

538
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,308
Father...

539
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:37,537
A bride for Khurram...

540
00:51:38,267 --> 00:51:39,541
and it will be a happy home.

541
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,978
He doesn't seem to like any girls.

542
00:51:43,667 --> 00:51:45,044
Why Mr. Khurram?

543
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,343
Well!

544
00:51:48,334 --> 00:51:50,473
All the pretty ones...

545
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:53,444
are already married...

546
00:51:55,067 --> 00:51:56,603
just like you!

547
00:52:05,534 --> 00:52:08,140
You wicked man...

548
00:52:13,467 --> 00:52:17,574
No father wants to see
his son as a militant.

549
00:52:17,633 --> 00:52:21,445
But sending him away
is not a way out either...

550
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:27,113
It is a grave problem...

551
00:52:27,167 --> 00:52:29,443
and an old one too.

552
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:34,048
We have lost a few
generations already...

553
00:52:36,167 --> 00:52:42,209
God alone knows when blood
will stop raining on our land.

554
00:52:43,033 --> 00:52:45,240
It's all up to India.

555
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:52,205
As they say in India, “birth right“.

556
00:52:53,467 --> 00:52:57,438
And we are only claiming our right...

557
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:58,410
Freedom.

558
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,975
Freedom...

559
00:53:03,834 --> 00:53:09,910
Gandhi won it for India...
not the gun.

560
00:53:11,034 --> 00:53:14,982
The gun only knows how to avenge...

561
00:53:16,367 --> 00:53:17,869
Commander...

562
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:23,113
revenge does not set you free..

563
00:53:23,167 --> 00:53:28,139
True freedom lies beyond violence..

564
00:53:30,334 --> 00:53:36,285
Remember...
Revenge only begets revenge.

565
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:46,507
- Don't you understand?
Can't you hear me?

566
00:53:47,867 --> 00:53:49,540
I am not going anywhere.

567
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,302
I am staying here.

568
00:53:55,167 --> 00:53:57,044
With my father.

569
00:54:09,734 --> 00:54:11,372
Jahid.. to the left...

570
00:54:22,167 --> 00:54:23,271
What is it now?

571
00:54:23,367 --> 00:54:25,404
I ask you, one last time...

572
00:54:26,734 --> 00:54:29,180
Will you go or not?

573
00:54:29,367 --> 00:54:30,778
Should I write it down for you?

574
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,040
I will not!

575
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:36,472
What is this, mother?!

576
00:54:37,234 --> 00:54:38,110
Will you go or not?

577
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:40,509
Please hear me out...

578
00:54:40,767 --> 00:54:41,268
- Will you go or not?

579
00:54:41,334 --> 00:54:42,438
Put the gun down mother...

580
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,104
Will you go or notl?

581
00:54:46,333 --> 00:54:47,403
Mother, please...

582
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:59,043
Would you really have
shot yourself that day?

583
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:02,379
Do you doubt me?

584
00:55:04,167 --> 00:55:06,113
No. I'm sure.

585
00:55:07,667 --> 00:55:09,374
You wouldn't have.

586
00:55:15,267 --> 00:55:18,908
Was there any other reason
for me to live... besides you?

587
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,336
Or is there?

588
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,972
I bore those long
painful years for you...

589
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:37,080
Don't...There you go again...

590
00:55:37,134 --> 00:55:38,875
You have to listen to me.

591
00:55:41,934 --> 00:55:44,972
Your father never really
cared for me. Our marriage was dead.

592
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:49,278
Which is why he gambled his life...

593
00:55:49,767 --> 00:55:51,075
our home...

594
00:55:51,833 --> 00:55:53,813
our honor...

595
00:55:53,867 --> 00:55:57,371
your future... risked it all.

596
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:07,115
Do we have to see everything
through your eyes?

597
00:56:08,367 --> 00:56:09,641
Always?

598
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:15,878
There are other ways of seeing.
Try sometime...

599
00:56:23,667 --> 00:56:27,137
Either way,
you will always blame me...

600
00:56:30,267 --> 00:56:34,272
I am used to it.

601
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,107
I know you love your father
more than anyone else...

602
00:56:47,767 --> 00:56:49,940
You certainly don't realise...

603
00:56:51,667 --> 00:56:54,341
What I went through
when you were away.

604
00:56:55,833 --> 00:57:01,681
Hilaal had lost himself in
the hospital, a saint saving lives.

605
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:09,948
I used to wail like a
hollow bamboo in your memory.

606
00:57:15,033 --> 00:57:19,709
I would wait months for you
to return home in the holidays.

607
00:57:23,634 --> 00:57:29,710
It is my fate to long... to wait...

608
00:57:36,267 --> 00:57:38,213
First for you...

609
00:57:41,634 --> 00:57:42,305
Now...

610
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:46,772
And now?

611
00:57:49,734 --> 00:57:55,844
The wives of disappeared people
are called 'half-widows' here.

612
00:57:59,667 --> 00:58:01,647
We can only wait.

613
00:58:06,833 --> 00:58:09,040
That is all I can do.

614
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:14,870
Wait.

615
00:58:16,067 --> 00:58:17,569
For father to return?

616
00:58:19,534 --> 00:58:20,478
Yes.

617
00:58:23,967 --> 00:58:26,538
Or for his corpse.

618
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:34,204
My father is alive!

619
00:58:35,934 --> 00:58:37,038
He's alive!

620
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:39,840
Do you understand?!

621
00:58:42,167 --> 00:58:45,979
Please tell me mother, he's alive...

622
00:58:48,667 --> 00:58:50,203
He's alive!

623
00:58:59,167 --> 00:59:01,147
Tell me mother...

624
00:59:03,667 --> 00:59:05,169
he's alive...

625
00:59:06,967 --> 00:59:08,674
Please tell me...

626
00:59:17,934 --> 00:59:19,607
Elections are the first step...

627
00:59:19,667 --> 00:59:20,702
on the long road to peace...

628
00:59:20,767 --> 00:59:23,680
It is a difficult journey...
but we can see our destination...

629
00:59:23,734 --> 00:59:26,408
Wherever you come from...

630
00:59:26,467 --> 00:59:27,969
people want the same thing...

631
00:59:28,133 --> 00:59:31,137
Our schools have been turned
into Army camps...

632
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,539
It is not a democracy...

633
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:37,745
it a suffocating system.
A 'suffo-cracy'!

634
00:59:41,434 --> 00:59:45,610
The town squares are lined with bunkers
and streets with barbed wires.

635
00:59:45,667 --> 00:59:47,442
According to the APDP there are...

636
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:50,037
over eight thousand people
who are missing since arrest...

637
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:57,843
- Your numbers are wrong...

638
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:00,779
What about those three hundred
thousand Kashmiri Pandits...

639
01:00:00,834 --> 01:00:03,542
displaced from their homes,
living as refugees...

640
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,170
Will you not count them
amongst the disappeared?

641
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:08,904
My brother disappeared months back.

642
01:00:08,934 --> 01:00:12,575
We have to raise our voices
to search for our own.

643
01:00:12,634 --> 01:00:14,443
- What do we want?
- Freedom...

644
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:16,104
- We'll snatch away...
- Freedom...

645
01:00:16,167 --> 01:00:18,977
And for this I am
running for elections...

646
01:00:25,134 --> 01:00:29,480
I would like to remind you
of our neighbor that arms and trains...

647
01:00:29,534 --> 01:00:33,573
misguided Kashmiri youth
to kill innocent people...

648
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:39,716
In 1948, they had looted Kashmiri's
when they came as tribals...

649
01:00:45,034 --> 01:00:48,504
Raped the women and
killed their children.

650
01:00:50,167 --> 01:00:54,582
It was the Indian army that
shed blood to save Kashmir.

651
01:00:56,433 --> 01:00:59,710
- And if we aren't around,
it'll happen again.

652
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:03,347
Does the law allow you to torture
people you've arrested?

653
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:05,641
The Indian army is one of the most...

654
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:08,078
disciplined armed
forces in the world.

655
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:12,448
We train our officers to interrogate,
and not torture.

656
01:01:12,567 --> 01:01:17,846
Amidst militant attacks,
today Kashmir goes to vote.

657
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:20,972
Militant groups have
exploded bombs in...

658
01:01:21,034 --> 01:01:23,776
Srinagar, Barahmulla and Anantnag.

659
01:01:24,667 --> 01:01:26,977
I want you to understand
the ground reality.

660
01:01:27,034 --> 01:01:30,538
Separatists are not demanding
freedom from India...

661
01:01:32,634 --> 01:01:34,580
but enslavement to Pakistan.

662
01:01:34,633 --> 01:01:38,809
- Indian troops coerced reluctant
voters into polling booths.

663
01:01:38,867 --> 01:01:41,370
- India has rubbished these allegations.

664
01:01:41,434 --> 01:01:44,381
- However, the voter turnout
remained very low.

665
01:01:44,433 --> 01:01:47,004
- Koshmar constituency saw
the lowest turn out...

666
01:01:47,067 --> 01:01:49,513
where only 110 votes were registered.

667
01:01:49,667 --> 01:01:50,737
- Congratulations!

668
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:51,904
You have won by a hundred votes.

669
01:01:51,967 --> 01:01:54,106
Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

670
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:13,638
These traditional folk entertainers
known as Bhand...

671
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:16,909
are enacting a play
which speaks of a new Kashmir...

672
01:02:17,533 --> 01:02:18,739
- A peaceful Kashmir...

673
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:22,270
- will the new regime bring
a brighter future for Kashmir?

674
01:02:22,667 --> 01:02:24,271
Only time will tell.

675
01:03:56,834 --> 01:03:57,812
Nice...

676
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:03,611
Very nice article.

677
01:04:06,434 --> 01:04:07,378
Thank you.

678
01:04:09,667 --> 01:04:12,273
- Come inside...

679
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:14,911
Come in...

680
01:04:15,167 --> 01:04:16,612
Why are you standing there?

681
01:04:16,667 --> 01:04:18,510
- Why don't you come inside...

682
01:04:19,167 --> 01:04:20,874
What has possessed you?

683
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:23,436
What is wrong with him?

684
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:24,570
I don't know...

685
01:04:24,767 --> 01:04:27,543
These days he just stands
outside the door for hours.

686
01:04:28,367 --> 01:04:29,812
He doesn't come in...

687
01:04:29,867 --> 01:04:31,244
- Frisk him.

688
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:38,706
Where are you coming from?

689
01:04:39,734 --> 01:04:40,804
Where are you going?

690
01:04:41,567 --> 01:04:42,409
What's in your pockets?

691
01:04:42,467 --> 01:04:43,309
Your identity card?

692
01:04:45,334 --> 01:04:46,210
You may go now.

693
01:04:51,134 --> 01:04:53,239
People have become so used to
body searches...

694
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:55,211
that unless they are frisked...

695
01:04:55,267 --> 01:04:58,248
they fear entering their own homes.

696
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:03,581
It's a psychological disorder...
the 'New Disease'...

697
01:05:05,334 --> 01:05:07,245
Are you a doctor?

698
01:05:07,667 --> 01:05:09,374
The doctor's soul.

699
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,541
Why are you following me?

700
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:40,370
What do you want?

701
01:05:40,767 --> 01:05:41,677
A message.

702
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:43,342
What?

703
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:44,478
A message.

704
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:47,542
I have no message for anyone.

705
01:05:47,734 --> 01:05:49,236
But I do...

706
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:52,371
A message for Haider,
from his father.

707
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:01,101
What?

708
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:05,545
A message for Haider shall be
delivered to Haider! Right?

709
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:16,770
Here is my number.

710
01:06:17,034 --> 01:06:19,378
I will wait for his call.

711
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:24,109
What is your name?

712
01:06:24,367 --> 01:06:25,311
Rooh...

713
01:06:26,134 --> 01:06:27,442
Roohdaar.

714
01:06:44,467 --> 01:06:47,710
Do we exist or do we not?!

715
01:06:47,767 --> 01:06:50,907
Do we exist or do we not?!

716
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:56,674
Haider...

717
01:06:56,734 --> 01:06:58,008
I have to tell you something...

718
01:06:58,434 --> 01:06:59,845
Listen to me...

719
01:07:00,534 --> 01:07:02,411
Haider... Listen to me.

720
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:04,771
There's a message from your father.

721
01:07:22,467 --> 01:07:23,002
Hello...

722
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:24,640
Hello...

723
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:26,476
Who is it?

724
01:07:27,767 --> 01:07:28,677
I am Haider...

725
01:07:29,767 --> 01:07:30,768
Haider who?

726
01:07:31,367 --> 01:07:32,539
<i>Haider Meet.</i>

727
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:35,511
Whom do you want?

728
01:07:36,834 --> 01:07:37,778
Roohdaar...

729
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,879
Downtown. Zaina Kadal bridge...
Tomorrow, 9 am.

730
01:07:41,934 --> 01:07:43,072
Okay... I...

731
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:12,605
What's he heading to Downtown for?

732
01:08:24,667 --> 01:08:25,771
Salman...

733
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:27,571
TO g0?

734
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:31,003
Or not to go?

735
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:44,704
Where is my father?

736
01:09:45,567 --> 01:09:46,875
In a faraway place...

737
01:09:48,334 --> 01:09:50,245
Very far...

738
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:54,813
You said you had
a message from him...

739
01:09:54,867 --> 01:09:56,642
Yes.

740
01:09:57,401 --> 01:09:58,607
What is it?

741
01:10:03,467 --> 01:10:04,810
Revenge.

742
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:09,736
Vengeance.

743
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:12,204
Vengeance from whom?

744
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:13,676
And why?

745
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:16,510
From a murderer...

746
01:10:16,667 --> 01:10:18,510
for a murder.

747
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:26,210
You seem to have confused matters.

748
01:10:26,267 --> 01:10:29,407
My father was arrested by the army
and one of these days...

749
01:10:29,467 --> 01:10:32,414
we will find out where
they're holding him.

750
01:10:34,634 --> 01:10:37,706
Let the petals fill with color...

751
01:10:37,734 --> 01:10:40,180
Let the breeze ruffle the spring...

752
01:11:02,434 --> 01:11:05,347
Come along, my love...

753
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:09,439
Awake the garden to life.

754
01:11:25,534 --> 01:11:30,108
The prison is a sullen ghost...

755
01:11:31,134 --> 01:11:38,279
Ask the breeze for a whiff of hope...

756
01:11:40,467 --> 01:11:46,076
Oh, someone please...

757
01:11:46,134 --> 01:11:52,176
speak of the beauty of my beloved.

758
01:11:52,234 --> 01:11:58,617
- When fatigue would muffle
our screams in the prison...

759
01:11:59,434 --> 01:12:03,814
a sole voice would
rise through the night...

760
01:12:04,267 --> 01:12:06,770
a balm to our agony...

761
01:12:11,367 --> 01:12:15,144
The lights were never turned off...

762
01:12:15,201 --> 01:12:17,681
we craved for the darkness.

763
01:12:18,434 --> 01:12:21,210
Lice roamed on our broken bodies...

764
01:12:21,267 --> 01:12:23,406
and vengeful snakes in our heads.

765
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:26,740
MAMA-2 was the other name for hell.

766
01:12:26,767 --> 01:12:30,476
Men returned as from there as mere
shadows of themselves.

767
01:12:30,534 --> 01:12:31,740
Officer...

768
01:12:32,467 --> 01:12:35,812
How many Area Commanders
do you have in Anantnag?

769
01:12:37,467 --> 01:12:39,140
Where did you get the RDX from?

770
01:12:39,567 --> 01:12:41,672
- Aren't you from the Binori mosque?

771
01:12:42,134 --> 01:12:44,705
Met Brigadier Badaam?

772
01:12:45,301 --> 01:12:47,645
Twenty children died
in your bomb blasts...

773
01:12:48,234 --> 01:12:49,611
Do you have any children?

774
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:51,476
No?

775
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:54,036
You won't father any.

776
01:12:54,334 --> 01:12:56,245
Give me their names!

777
01:13:08,334 --> 01:13:11,440
Sir, I swear I'm a student.

778
01:13:11,534 --> 01:13:13,445
I swear, sir...

779
01:13:13,534 --> 01:13:16,105
I'm not a militant.

780
01:13:16,467 --> 01:13:17,673
I'm not a militant.

781
01:13:18,034 --> 01:13:19,741
Let's hear it all together...
Long live India!

782
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,070
Long live India!

783
01:13:21,134 --> 01:13:22,579
- Long live India!
- Long live India!

784
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:25,376
Long live India!

785
01:13:30,501 --> 01:13:33,607
Since that day doctor
and I were always together...

786
01:13:33,667 --> 01:13:36,307
like body and soul...

787
01:13:37,467 --> 01:13:41,472
We bore our torments together
in the same cell.

788
01:13:42,167 --> 01:13:44,272
We were chained together.

789
01:13:46,334 --> 01:13:49,679
It seems we will be
killed together as well.

790
01:13:51,067 --> 01:13:54,139
You can die doctor, but I won't.

791
01:13:56,534 --> 01:13:57,945
And how is that?

792
01:13:58,501 --> 01:14:01,414
You are the body
and I'm the soul...

793
01:14:01,467 --> 01:14:04,073
You are mortal and I'm immortal!

794
01:14:07,467 --> 01:14:10,346
Are you a Shia or a Sunni?

795
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,913
I am the river and the tree...

796
01:14:15,434 --> 01:14:18,244
The Jhelum and the Chinar...

797
01:14:19,601 --> 01:14:22,411
I'm both..
a temple and a mosque...

798
01:14:23,134 --> 01:14:25,637
A Shia and a Sunni, I'm both.

799
01:14:27,167 --> 01:14:28,942
A Hindu as well.

800
01:14:30,634 --> 01:14:33,376
I always was... I am...

801
01:14:34,334 --> 01:14:36,280
I will always be...

802
01:14:39,267 --> 01:14:43,113
They moved us to other
camps for interrogation.

803
01:14:44,467 --> 01:14:47,573
Strange camps... stranger names...

804
01:14:49,867 --> 01:14:52,871
Bo-Bo land, Hotel 6...

805
01:14:53,034 --> 01:14:54,274
Faraz cinema...

806
01:15:37,434 --> 01:15:42,315
And one day, there was a revelation.

807
01:15:45,534 --> 01:15:48,276
It was Khurram who
betrayed your father.

808
01:15:52,801 --> 01:15:54,974
Khurram had handled
most of the cases of...

809
01:15:55,034 --> 01:15:57,412
militants caught or
surrendered in Kashmir.

810
01:15:58,267 --> 01:16:02,272
With his help Indian Intelligence
played their trump card...

811
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:06,312
forming a militia
to kill militants...

812
01:16:06,367 --> 01:16:08,438
A counter-insurgency force...

813
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:10,436
<i>khwan-m-Mukhbireen</i>

814
01:16:14,367 --> 01:16:17,541
The Ikhwans knew
militant sympathisers...

815
01:16:17,801 --> 01:16:19,838
and their modus operandi.

816
01:16:21,767 --> 01:16:24,543
- The terror of Ikhwan surpassed The horrors...

817
01:16:24,801 --> 01:16:26,371
Kashmir has seen before.

818
01:16:29,067 --> 01:16:32,105
- It was Khuram who killed your father.

819
01:16:37,401 --> 01:16:42,146
- The army crackdown in your village
was not a matter of chance.

820
01:16:42,267 --> 01:16:44,543
- Khurram was the army's informer...

821
01:16:45,301 --> 01:16:49,408
- and your mother Ghazala was Khurram's

822
01:16:50,534 --> 01:16:53,811
- It is certain. We shall witness...

823
01:16:54,034 --> 01:16:59,450
The promised day...

824
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:05,174
the day of the blessed word...

825
01:17:06,201 --> 01:17:09,410
We shall witness...

826
01:17:13,267 --> 01:17:14,245
Roohdaar...

827
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:16,270
Yes.

828
01:17:16,934 --> 01:17:19,278
If you do make it out alive...

829
01:17:20,234 --> 01:17:22,908
Convey my message.

830
01:17:22,967 --> 01:17:24,207
To whom?

831
01:17:26,334 --> 01:17:28,507
To my son, Haider.

832
01:17:30,101 --> 01:17:33,310
Tell him to avenge my betrayal...

833
01:17:34,334 --> 01:17:36,143
by my brother.

834
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:42,510
Tell him to aim his bullets at those
cunning, deceiving eyes...

835
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:47,338
that entrapped his mother...

836
01:17:49,301 --> 01:17:54,273
that made him an orphan.

837
01:17:57,201 --> 01:17:58,703
And his mother?

838
01:18:01,267 --> 01:18:04,714
God will be her judge.

839
01:18:12,234 --> 01:18:15,772
We had become a burden
for everyone...

840
01:18:16,467 --> 01:18:21,109
They handed us over
to the Ikhwan.

841
01:18:35,267 --> 01:18:37,941
It was a miracle!

842
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:43,048
The rope that bound us
came loose...

843
01:18:43,234 --> 01:18:51,153
The icy water of the Jhelum
stopped my bleeding.

844
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:56,646
Sand-miners on the
river bank saved me.

845
01:18:58,667 --> 01:19:01,739
A few days later, they found
the doctor's body.

846
01:19:03,267 --> 01:19:09,684
A little ahead of Baramulla, at Boniyar village
there is a graveyard...

847
01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:20,912
where the unknown dead are buried.

848
01:19:21,767 --> 01:19:24,008
They buried your father there...

849
01:19:24,067 --> 01:19:26,069
he rests in grave number 318.

850
01:19:38,667 --> 01:19:40,340
This is the safety lock.

851
01:19:42,334 --> 01:19:44,041
Shoot him at point blank.

852
01:19:44,101 --> 01:19:45,944
And remember...

853
01:19:46,001 --> 01:19:50,814
aim at the eyes
that entrapped your mother.

854
01:19:54,334 --> 01:19:57,144
Those treacherous eyes
that orphaned you.

855
01:21:23,867 --> 01:21:26,279
Father...

856
01:22:03,801 --> 01:22:07,442
Who are you calling
so early in the morning?

857
01:22:07,867 --> 01:22:09,869
I had a nightmare.

858
01:22:11,701 --> 01:22:12,941
What was it about?

859
01:22:23,034 --> 01:22:23,978
Haider?

860
01:22:26,034 --> 01:22:28,878
Two days and no word of him.

861
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:33,079
Neither Arshee nor
the Salmans know...

862
01:22:33,134 --> 01:22:34,943
My dearest...

863
01:22:35,567 --> 01:22:36,944
He's not a child anymore.

864
01:22:37,534 --> 01:22:39,013
He'll be back.

865
01:22:41,567 --> 01:22:44,912
I bumped into the principal
of your school yesterday.

866
01:22:45,734 --> 01:22:48,943
He wanted to know when
you are returning to teach.

867
01:22:50,067 --> 01:22:52,741
The children miss you very much...

868
01:22:53,634 --> 01:22:55,807
Once I become whole.

869
01:22:55,867 --> 01:22:57,972
What are you now? Half?

870
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:03,006
I am half-widow and half-bride.

871
01:23:03,434 --> 01:23:05,641
You are half a fool as well.

872
01:23:22,034 --> 01:23:23,377
Roohdaar!

873
01:23:28,934 --> 01:23:32,746
- This is the number he called.

874
01:23:32,834 --> 01:23:33,938
It is a satellite phone.

875
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,479
It can't be traced.

876
01:23:42,734 --> 01:23:44,975
Sir, you had mentioned about
a permanent job for us...

877
01:23:45,067 --> 01:23:46,910
another time perhaps...

878
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:01,637
Miss, your gift is ready...

879
01:24:01,700 --> 01:24:02,940
- Thank you.
- You are welcome...

880
01:24:17,034 --> 01:24:19,514
Daddy! is this a snowman?

881
01:24:19,667 --> 01:24:20,475
No...

882
01:24:20,767 --> 01:24:22,337
This is your husband.

883
01:24:23,767 --> 01:24:25,405
Do you like his nose?

884
01:24:25,934 --> 01:24:27,538
Or shall I cut it a bit?

885
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:32,509
What is that?

886
01:24:34,401 --> 01:24:35,402
A surprise.

887
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:36,835
Oh.

888
01:24:44,300 --> 01:24:46,746
Oh... God.

889
01:24:47,434 --> 01:24:50,005
When did...

890
01:24:50,267 --> 01:24:51,610
When did you weave it?

891
01:24:54,767 --> 01:24:57,247
My sweet child.

892
01:24:59,367 --> 01:25:00,539
Here, have one more.

893
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:02,807
It took a lot to make this for you.

894
01:25:02,967 --> 01:25:05,379
No daddy. I'm not hungry.

895
01:25:06,567 --> 01:25:10,674
He's not going to return
sooner if you stop eating.

896
01:25:12,900 --> 01:25:15,403
Who brought him the message?

897
01:25:18,567 --> 01:25:19,841
Roohdaar?

898
01:25:25,534 --> 01:25:26,569
Open your mouth.

899
01:25:31,567 --> 01:25:34,275
We'll have to take care of Haider...

900
01:25:36,501 --> 01:25:37,411
Together.

901
01:25:41,267 --> 01:25:43,747
Don't hide anything from me.

902
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:08,735
What is going on?

903
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:11,211
A traffic jam at the square...

904
01:26:34,667 --> 01:26:35,611
Hello...

905
01:26:36,334 --> 01:26:39,713
Hello...
mic testing one, two, three...

906
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:41,936
Can you hear me?

907
01:26:42,201 --> 01:26:43,305
Hello...

908
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:50,841
UN council
resolution number 47 of 1948...

909
01:26:51,300 --> 01:26:55,544
article <i>2</i> of the Geneva convention
and article 370 of the Indian constitution...

910
01:26:55,767 --> 01:26:57,576
Raises but one question!

911
01:26:58,900 --> 01:27:00,402
Haider...
- What?

912
01:27:00,834 --> 01:27:02,575
Do we exist or do we not?

913
01:27:04,167 --> 01:27:05,612
If we do... then who are we?

914
01:27:05,667 --> 01:27:07,704
If not... then where are we?

915
01:27:09,567 --> 01:27:10,409
Did we exist at all?

916
01:27:10,467 --> 01:27:11,741
Or not?

917
01:27:12,701 --> 01:27:14,806
Chutzpah is our problem.

918
01:27:15,334 --> 01:27:17,245
Do you know what chutzpah means?

919
01:27:17,534 --> 01:27:19,878
Once upon a time a bank was robbed.

920
01:27:20,467 --> 01:27:21,707
Pointing the gun at the cashier...

921
01:27:21,767 --> 01:27:24,270
the burglar threatened...
give me the money or die..

922
01:27:24,334 --> 01:27:26,314
The cashier gave him all the money.

923
01:27:26,634 --> 01:27:29,581
He went to the next counter...

924
01:27:30,934 --> 01:27:33,915
And asked the man to
open an account for him.

925
01:27:37,934 --> 01:27:40,915
That is chutzpah...

926
01:27:41,667 --> 01:27:44,614
Such audacity, such stupidity.
like AFSPA...

927
01:27:45,267 --> 01:27:47,838
You carry on... I'll fetch him...

928
01:27:48,101 --> 01:27:48,806
AFSPA...

929
01:27:49,467 --> 01:27:50,502
Attention!

930
01:27:50,567 --> 01:27:53,309
Armed Forces Special Powers Act,
section 5, rule 4, point A...

931
01:27:53,367 --> 01:27:54,812
Any commissioned officer...
Yes sir!

932
01:27:54,867 --> 01:27:56,369
Warrant officer...
Yes sir!

933
01:27:56,434 --> 01:27:57,811
Non-commissioned officer...
Yes sir!

934
01:27:58,100 --> 01:28:01,570
Or any other person of equivalent rank
in the armed forces may, in a disturbed area...

935
01:28:01,634 --> 01:28:05,207
if he is of the opinion that it is necessary
so to do for the maintenance of public order...

936
01:28:05,267 --> 01:28:07,713
after giving such due warning as
he may consider necessary...

937
01:28:07,767 --> 01:28:11,647
fire upon or otherwise use force,
even to the causing of death...

938
01:28:15,367 --> 01:28:20,339
Against anyone acting in
contravention with law or order.

939
01:28:21,334 --> 01:28:23,439
Law and order...

940
01:28:25,334 --> 01:28:28,440
Law and order...

941
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:30,343
Order order...
- Law and order...

942
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:32,138
There is no law,
there is no order.

943
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:33,645
Whose laws? Whose order?

944
01:28:33,700 --> 01:28:34,474
Made on order...

945
01:28:34,534 --> 01:28:35,410
Law and order...

946
01:28:35,467 --> 01:28:39,176
India! Pakistan!
A game on the border.

947
01:28:39,467 --> 01:28:41,538
India clings to us..

948
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:43,102
Pakistan leeches on...

949
01:28:43,734 --> 01:28:46,237
What of us? What do we want?

950
01:28:46,300 --> 01:28:47,176
Freedom!

951
01:28:47,234 --> 01:28:49,043
Freedom from this side...
- Freedom!

952
01:28:49,101 --> 01:28:50,512
Freedom from that side...
- Freedom!

953
01:28:50,567 --> 01:28:52,638
We will be free!
- Freedom!

954
01:28:54,167 --> 01:28:55,373
Haider!

955
01:28:58,101 --> 01:29:05,315
"A world better than the world,
our lndia..."

956
01:29:05,367 --> 01:29:07,244
"We are her children..."

957
01:29:07,301 --> 01:29:08,177
Haider...

958
01:29:09,267 --> 01:29:09,768
Yes?

959
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:14,077
Mother...
- What?

960
01:29:15,467 --> 01:29:17,276
Mother...
- Whose?

961
01:29:18,134 --> 01:29:18,703
Yours...

962
01:29:18,767 --> 01:29:21,043
Mine... yes...

963
01:29:28,034 --> 01:29:29,707
Mother...

964
01:29:29,767 --> 01:29:31,440
When did you come?

965
01:29:32,167 --> 01:29:33,646
Why are you crying?

966
01:29:33,767 --> 01:29:35,713
There's good news for you.

967
01:29:36,067 --> 01:29:37,375
Nobody will call
you a half-widow now...

968
01:29:38,300 --> 01:29:39,779
Father is dead.

969
01:29:40,534 --> 01:29:41,569
He is dead.

970
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:46,171
I found his grave.

971
01:29:47,067 --> 01:29:50,378
No more hidden musicals.

972
01:29:53,534 --> 01:29:55,343
You don't believe me, right?

973
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:57,004
Hang on...

974
01:29:57,067 --> 01:29:58,478
I have a photograph...

975
01:30:00,100 --> 01:30:01,738
My dead father...

976
01:30:01,967 --> 01:30:03,241
Mother...

977
01:30:03,434 --> 01:30:04,708
Look at this.

978
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:08,604
Mother...

979
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:53,571
I couldn't find my brother.

980
01:30:55,634 --> 01:30:58,012
But I have found his killer.

981
01:31:01,201 --> 01:31:06,173
He shared his cell at MAMA-2.

982
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:09,546
He goes by the name Roohdaar...

983
01:31:11,667 --> 01:31:14,273
No one knows his real name.

984
01:31:14,934 --> 01:31:18,643
Even] identity of
his is a ghost identity.

985
01:31:19,567 --> 01:31:22,480
He came from Pakistan in 1990.

986
01:31:23,034 --> 01:31:24,206
An ISI agent.

987
01:31:26,900 --> 01:31:31,042
Two years back, he was
arrested in Baramulla.

988
01:31:31,901 --> 01:31:34,279
He cut a deal with the Indian army...

989
01:31:34,334 --> 01:31:39,079
He penetrated Zahoor's group...
A double agent...

990
01:31:43,334 --> 01:31:47,248
My brother got to know that.

991
01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:55,046
Which is why he negotiated...

992
01:31:55,967 --> 01:31:58,538
his release as well.

993
01:32:00,434 --> 01:32:02,345
On the way out...

994
01:32:03,067 --> 01:32:05,240
he...

995
01:32:05,300 --> 01:32:09,009
He... killed him...

996
01:32:14,334 --> 01:32:16,610
and pushed him into
the Jhelum river...

997
01:32:16,967 --> 01:32:20,881
These people have killed my brother.

998
01:32:21,367 --> 01:32:25,440
Until I avenge his death...

999
01:32:28,067 --> 01:32:29,944
I will not rest...

1000
01:32:31,834 --> 01:32:32,539
I promise you...

1001
01:32:34,100 --> 01:32:34,840
Haider...

1002
01:32:39,367 --> 01:32:40,607
Haider...

1003
01:32:43,067 --> 01:32:45,513
Come in, little princess...

1004
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:01,978
Hello.

1005
01:33:02,801 --> 01:33:04,109
Hello.

1006
01:33:06,534 --> 01:33:08,411
What an imbecile you are!

1007
01:33:08,467 --> 01:33:10,071
You disappear for days!

1008
01:33:10,134 --> 01:33:12,375
You don't even tell
me when you are back.

1009
01:33:12,801 --> 01:33:15,213
I worn] for you in vain.

1010
01:33:19,167 --> 01:33:20,805
You are so haggard...

1011
01:33:23,034 --> 01:33:26,140
Why don't you find me a cure!

1012
01:37:34,300 --> 01:37:36,906
Everyone doubts you are going mad.

1013
01:37:40,234 --> 01:37:43,215
I trust my doubts but...

1014
01:37:43,534 --> 01:37:45,878
doubt my trusts.

1015
01:37:48,134 --> 01:37:49,511
What do you mean?

1016
01:37:50,134 --> 01:37:51,078
I mean...

1017
01:37:53,601 --> 01:37:56,810
Is Roohdaar the brave,
beloved witness?

1018
01:37:57,234 --> 01:38:00,147
Is Khurram the master of falsehood?

1019
01:38:00,834 --> 01:38:03,144
Whose tells a conceited tale?

1020
01:38:03,867 --> 01:38:06,848
Whose bears the cross of truth?

1021
01:38:07,801 --> 01:38:10,213
To believe or not to believe.

1022
01:38:11,100 --> 01:38:13,205
That is the question...

1023
01:38:14,501 --> 01:38:19,280
The answer hides
in yet another question.

1024
01:38:27,534 --> 01:38:28,512
What is that?

1025
01:38:33,001 --> 01:38:36,505
To trust the surging
beats of the head...

1026
01:38:36,700 --> 01:38:40,512
Or to heed the caution
of sober mind...

1027
01:38:40,701 --> 01:38:43,944
To kill or to die..

1028
01:38:45,634 --> 01:38:48,945
To be or not to be.

1029
01:38:52,100 --> 01:38:53,704
Where did you get this?

1030
01:38:53,967 --> 01:38:54,911
Give it back...

1031
01:38:56,434 --> 01:38:56,935
Haider...

1032
01:38:58,801 --> 01:39:00,781
You will do no such thing.

1033
01:39:01,834 --> 01:39:03,814
Whether it's the truth or a lie...

1034
01:39:08,567 --> 01:39:09,671
Swear upon me.

1035
01:39:12,501 --> 01:39:14,742
I have Iovvedd you more than my life.

1036
01:39:23,134 --> 01:39:25,614
Not Iovvedd, it's loved...

1037
01:39:26,067 --> 01:39:27,774
The V and D softly.

1038
01:39:27,834 --> 01:39:29,438
Say it... loved.

1039
01:39:30,700 --> 01:39:31,678
<i>Low e-d.</i>

1040
01:39:32,900 --> 01:39:33,935
Say.. Kicked.

1041
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:35,078
<i>Kick-Keri .</i>

1042
01:39:35,134 --> 01:39:36,579
Plucked.
- Pluck-ked.

1043
01:39:36,767 --> 01:39:37,575
Sucked...

1044
01:39:37,634 --> 01:39:38,203
<i>Suck-Keri ...</i>

1045
01:39:38,467 --> 01:39:39,036
Fwwf.

1046
01:39:39,100 --> 01:39:39,771
Fu...

1047
01:39:43,734 --> 01:39:45,771
'Baster-ed'...
- 'Baster-ed'...

1048
01:40:11,734 --> 01:40:20,017
Thank you for being with us
in this time of grief.

1049
01:40:20,767 --> 01:40:28,015
Somehow I have gathered myself
to bear this bitter loss but...

1050
01:40:28,967 --> 01:40:31,504
the thought of seeing my beloved
sister-in-law live a widow's life...

1051
01:40:31,568 --> 01:40:34,515
and my dearest Haider as an orphan...

1052
01:40:35,034 --> 01:40:38,481
How do I find the courage
to bear that?

1053
01:40:39,734 --> 01:40:44,012
And thus facing these facts,
I seek your permission...

1054
01:40:44,067 --> 01:40:47,810
My elders and friends
present here, allow me...

1055
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:53,710
to marry my sister-in-law
Ghazala Meer...

1056
01:40:54,667 --> 01:40:57,841
God bless!
- God bless!

1057
01:41:36,567 --> 01:41:37,568
Father...

1058
01:41:37,634 --> 01:41:39,773
My father-to-be...

1059
01:41:53,867 --> 01:41:56,677
Go on.. feed this fellow.

1060
01:42:07,634 --> 01:42:09,739
Mother...
- My angel...

1061
01:42:11,834 --> 01:42:14,314
What is this?

1062
01:42:14,600 --> 01:42:16,876
When will you grow up?
- Never...

1063
01:42:17,334 --> 01:42:18,404
What is this?

1064
01:42:22,401 --> 01:42:25,974
Remember what you would say
when you were a child?

1065
01:42:26,234 --> 01:42:27,235
What?

1066
01:42:27,534 --> 01:42:30,413
"When I grow up I'm going
to marn/ my mommy."

1067
01:42:32,967 --> 01:42:36,312
You would snuggle between
your father and me.

1068
01:42:38,667 --> 01:42:42,638
Even if he touched me,
you would fight with him.

1069
01:42:44,467 --> 01:42:46,708
And now his brother touches you...

1070
01:42:48,567 --> 01:42:50,478
What should I do now?

1071
01:42:56,367 --> 01:42:59,576
Who would want to share
you with the world?

1072
01:43:09,234 --> 01:43:11,339
Your beauty is venomous.

1073
01:43:53,634 --> 01:43:59,550
They have given him a pistol...

1074
01:44:00,234 --> 01:44:01,804
to kill uncle Khurram...

1075
01:44:18,567 --> 01:44:19,841
- Ghazala Akhtar...

1076
01:44:20,101 --> 01:44:25,101
Do you accept Khurram Hussain Meer
as your lawfully married husband?

1077
01:44:32,834 --> 01:44:33,835
I do.

1078
01:44:34,267 --> 01:44:35,268
- Do you accept?

1079
01:44:36,567 --> 01:44:37,511
I do.

1080
01:44:37,701 --> 01:44:38,771
- Do you accept?

1081
01:44:39,734 --> 01:44:40,735
I do.

1082
01:44:41,834 --> 01:44:45,077
<i>- Khurram Hussein Meet...</i>

1083
01:44:45,134 --> 01:44:50,311
do you accept Ghazala Akhtar
as your lawfully married wife?

1084
01:44:50,367 --> 01:44:51,471
I do.

1085
01:45:08,434 --> 01:45:12,541
O nightingale's head,
O wounded bird

1086
01:45:12,601 --> 01:45:16,378
Stay away, stay away,
don't meet the flower

1087
01:45:16,634 --> 01:45:20,776
O nightingale's head,
O wounded bird

1088
01:45:21,234 --> 01:45:24,807
Stay away, stay away,
don't meet the flower

1089
01:45:29,601 --> 01:45:33,640
A head in conflict is in
difficulty indeed

1090
01:45:33,734 --> 01:45:36,806
If the head is pounding,
the head is pounding

1091
01:45:38,234 --> 01:45:40,271
If the head is pounding,
the head is pounding

1092
01:45:40,334 --> 01:45:43,679
Then a pounding head
can be wicked too

1093
01:45:44,467 --> 01:45:48,472
The flower's scent
is filled with poison

1094
01:45:48,634 --> 01:45:50,671
Stay away, stay away,
don't meet the flower

1095
01:45:50,734 --> 01:45:52,577
O nightingale's head

1096
01:45:53,034 --> 01:45:55,014
Stay away, stay away,
don't meet the flower

1097
01:45:55,067 --> 01:45:57,138
O nightingale's head

1098
01:46:33,400 --> 01:46:37,007
Listen, O world,
I want to speak

1099
01:46:37,534 --> 01:46:40,276
Your story again
I wish to repeat

1100
01:46:41,567 --> 01:46:46,016
O nightingale's head,
O wounded bird

1101
01:46:50,033 --> 01:46:54,175
There was a pair of birds,
A male and female

1102
01:46:54,234 --> 01:46:58,341
The female was innocent,
The male was simple

1103
01:46:58,534 --> 01:47:02,676
There was a pair of birds,
A male and female

1104
01:47:02,734 --> 01:47:06,705
The female was innocent,
The male was simple

1105
01:47:07,301 --> 01:47:11,545
When the mountains
Were covered with snow

1106
01:47:13,401 --> 01:47:16,280
A falcon of bad intention

1107
01:47:17,567 --> 01:47:19,638
A falcon of bad intention

1108
01:47:19,701 --> 01:47:24,116
Flew above the trees and forest

1109
01:47:24,367 --> 01:47:28,474
Death lurked within its folded wings

1110
01:47:28,534 --> 01:47:32,505
Searching to find
A palace's destination

1111
01:47:32,700 --> 01:47:36,739
Searching to find
A palace's destination

1112
01:47:54,001 --> 01:47:57,642
It found a home in
the nightingale's dreams

1113
01:47:58,267 --> 01:48:02,238
And stung them with lethal venom

1114
01:48:02,300 --> 01:48:06,510
Put poison in the scented flowers

1115
01:48:06,567 --> 01:48:11,016
Send to the nightingale in question.

1116
01:48:11,134 --> 01:48:13,341
And stung them with lethal venom

1117
01:48:13,367 --> 01:48:15,313
It found a home in
the nightingale's dreams

1118
01:48:15,367 --> 01:48:17,347
Send to the nightingale in question.

1119
01:48:17,401 --> 01:48:19,574
And stung them with lethal venom

1120
01:48:21,900 --> 01:48:23,902
He sprinkled gun powder in the valley

1121
01:48:23,967 --> 01:48:26,004
Below the lake put snares in sway

1122
01:48:26,067 --> 01:48:30,038
Dangling daggers against the male

1123
01:48:30,334 --> 01:48:32,314
Dangling daggers against the male

1124
01:48:32,367 --> 01:48:36,110
Cut the bird's wings away

1125
01:48:36,367 --> 01:48:40,907
O head, my head, my head,
Only cowards lie

1126
01:48:41,034 --> 01:48:45,107
O nightingale's head,
O wounded bird

1127
01:48:45,467 --> 01:48:51,110
O nightingale's head,
O wounded bird

1128
01:49:11,134 --> 01:49:17,517
He had the injured man imprisoned

1129
01:49:20,167 --> 01:49:25,310
And tied him up like a slave

1130
01:49:27,001 --> 01:49:31,973
Took him to the Jhelum bridge

1131
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:38,608
And threw him to a watery grave

1132
01:49:43,167 --> 01:49:47,274
Jhelum, Jhelum...

1133
01:49:47,434 --> 01:49:51,507
<i>Red, your amour is red</i>

1134
01:49:51,867 --> 01:49:56,077
Jhelum, Jhelum...

1135
01:49:56,134 --> 01:50:00,207
<i>Red, your amour is red</i>

1136
01:50:04,367 --> 01:50:08,406
But the river's of Kashmir
Have their unique essence

1137
01:50:08,967 --> 01:50:13,006
The chains broke,
As did destiny's tide

1138
01:50:13,134 --> 01:50:17,014
He's alive, he will be living

1139
01:50:17,267 --> 01:50:20,544
The criminal now cannot hide

1140
01:50:21,501 --> 01:50:23,777
He's alive, he will be living

1141
01:50:23,834 --> 01:50:26,041
The criminal now cannot hide

1142
01:50:32,301 --> 01:50:40,379
Come to your senses,
lover's nightingale

1143
01:50:40,434 --> 01:50:44,883
The flower's scent
is filled with poison

1144
01:50:44,934 --> 01:50:48,711
Come to your senses,
lover's nightingale

1145
01:50:49,100 --> 01:50:53,207
Come to your senses,
lover's nightingale

1146
01:51:20,034 --> 01:51:22,310
Such a brilliant stow!

1147
01:51:23,401 --> 01:51:24,402
- Who wrote This play?

1148
01:51:25,700 --> 01:51:28,738
Zahoor Hussain?
Or was it Roohdaar?

1149
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:33,903
Didn't they give you a gun too?

1150
01:51:35,301 --> 01:51:36,837
To kill me?

1151
01:51:46,267 --> 01:51:49,043
What shall we do Ghazala?

1152
01:51:50,234 --> 01:51:51,975
Die by his bullet?

1153
01:51:53,801 --> 01:51:55,246
Or have him treated?

1154
01:51:58,100 --> 01:51:59,306
In an asylum.

1155
01:52:01,134 --> 01:52:02,044
Don't let him get away...

1156
01:52:02,100 --> 01:52:02,874
- Haider...

1157
01:52:02,934 --> 01:52:03,776
Catch him...

1158
01:52:03,834 --> 01:52:05,006
- Haider...

1159
01:52:10,034 --> 01:52:12,810
- Follow him... come on...

1160
01:52:33,301 --> 01:52:36,373
It's Post Traumatic
Stress Disorder...

1161
01:52:36,634 --> 01:52:37,908
- PTSD.

1162
01:52:37,967 --> 01:52:40,379
He needs psychiatric care.

1163
01:52:40,834 --> 01:52:42,575
I've had a word at the hospital.

1164
01:52:42,634 --> 01:52:45,342
We'll admit him in the
morning after curfew.

1165
01:52:45,934 --> 01:52:49,074
If he wakes up,
he'll make a run for it.

1166
01:52:49,834 --> 01:52:51,575
I have sedated him well.

1167
01:52:51,634 --> 01:52:53,307
He won't wake up for hours.

1168
01:52:56,134 --> 01:53:00,105
There's a curfew out there,
I'll drop you in my car.

1169
01:53:00,167 --> 01:53:02,670
Okay, thank you.
- Come on.

1170
01:53:27,767 --> 01:53:28,643
Arshee...

1171
01:53:29,334 --> 01:53:30,176
Arshee...

1172
01:53:30,834 --> 01:53:31,904
Open the door...

1173
01:53:33,067 --> 01:53:34,842
You misunderstand me.

1174
01:53:36,034 --> 01:53:36,944
No!

1175
01:53:38,701 --> 01:53:40,271
You have betrayed me.

1176
01:53:40,934 --> 01:53:42,743
You took advantage of my trust.

1177
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:43,938
You used me...

1178
01:53:46,267 --> 01:53:50,044
You don't care for Haider's life...

1179
01:53:50,667 --> 01:53:53,238
You want to use him to
catch those people...

1180
01:53:53,501 --> 01:53:55,139
who exposed Khurram.

1181
01:53:57,001 --> 01:54:03,680
You don't care if Haider has to die.

1182
01:54:06,034 --> 01:54:09,208
Open the door and let me explain...

1183
01:54:09,801 --> 01:54:12,008
Try to see my point

1184
01:54:12,034 --> 01:54:14,776
I don't want to get your point.

1185
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:17,974
I don't want to see you... ever!

1186
01:54:58,501 --> 01:54:59,479
Haider...

1187
01:55:03,534 --> 01:55:05,741
Avenge me...

1188
01:55:07,634 --> 01:55:08,874
of my brother.

1189
01:55:12,601 --> 01:55:16,572
Aim bullets at those
cunning, deceiving eyes...

1190
01:55:17,100 --> 01:55:20,570
that entrapped your mother...

1191
01:55:23,134 --> 01:55:24,943
Don't forget...

1192
01:57:02,067 --> 01:57:03,603
My Lord...

1193
01:57:07,367 --> 01:57:11,474
my crime, my sin stinks...

1194
01:57:15,901 --> 01:57:19,110
- I'm drowning in guilt.

1195
01:57:19,367 --> 01:57:24,715
- My soul reeks of my brother's blood...

1196
01:57:24,767 --> 01:57:27,145
Wash me clean...

1197
01:57:27,401 --> 01:57:30,041
with the rain of your mercy, My Lord!

1198
01:57:34,634 --> 01:57:36,978
Bereave me of all you bestowed...

1199
01:57:41,667 --> 01:57:45,410
All the wealth, all the power,
all the fame...

1200
01:57:46,534 --> 01:57:49,515
Everything ...

1201
01:57:49,967 --> 01:57:54,313
- Let The rain of your mercy...

1202
01:57:55,401 --> 01:57:57,881
cleanse me, my Lord!

1203
01:58:10,567 --> 01:58:11,409
Haider...

1204
01:58:12,567 --> 01:58:13,602
What are you doing?

1205
01:58:14,900 --> 01:58:15,935
- Haider...

1206
01:58:16,934 --> 01:58:18,072
Give me the pistol...

1207
01:58:19,301 --> 01:58:20,371
Do as I say...

1208
01:58:21,067 --> 01:58:22,045
Give me the pistol...

1209
01:58:22,301 --> 01:58:22,836
- Haider...

1210
01:58:24,367 --> 01:58:25,437
Grab him...

1211
01:58:26,434 --> 01:58:27,606
Hold his hands...

1212
01:58:29,934 --> 01:58:31,436
Show me your hands...

1213
01:58:33,734 --> 01:58:34,644
What are you doing?

1214
01:58:34,701 --> 01:58:35,645
- Let go of him...

1215
01:58:36,767 --> 01:58:37,404
- Let go of him...

1216
01:58:37,467 --> 01:58:39,913
We caught him in time...
or he might have...

1217
01:58:39,968 --> 01:58:43,711
I didn't kill you for
you were in prayer...

1218
01:58:43,934 --> 01:58:48,007
Even a ghastly sinner would enter
heaven if killed in prayer.

1219
01:58:48,634 --> 01:58:51,240
Haider...
you have really gone insane!

1220
01:58:51,267 --> 01:58:52,337
Take him away...

1221
01:58:52,400 --> 01:58:55,609
I will kill you...
when you are in sin...

1222
01:58:55,667 --> 01:58:57,237
not when you are in prayer...

1223
01:58:58,400 --> 01:59:00,971
I'll aim my bullets at
your treacherous eyes, Khurram...

1224
01:59:01,234 --> 01:59:04,340
those deceitful eyes that
entrapped my mother.

1225
01:59:04,867 --> 01:59:06,904
I will aim my bullets
at your treacherous eyes...

1226
01:59:06,967 --> 01:59:09,880
those deceitful eyes that
entrapped my mother...

1227
01:59:16,434 --> 01:59:17,344
Move it...

1228
01:59:23,334 --> 01:59:24,244
Step inside.

1229
01:59:35,234 --> 01:59:36,577
Shoot from a distance...

1230
01:59:36,900 --> 01:59:38,641
And shoot him on the back.

1231
02:00:06,434 --> 02:00:07,242
Wake-up!

1232
02:00:07,301 --> 02:00:07,745
Wake-up?

1233
02:00:07,801 --> 02:00:08,711
Wake-up you idiot!

1234
02:00:10,367 --> 02:00:11,744
Take out your gun!

1235
02:00:13,334 --> 02:00:14,312
Watch out!

1236
02:00:41,334 --> 02:00:44,838
Haider don't!
We'll do as you say...

1237
02:00:45,301 --> 02:00:46,803
Free my hands.

1238
02:00:46,867 --> 02:00:48,244
Okay.

1239
02:00:50,401 --> 02:00:51,675
It is not my fault...

1240
02:00:51,734 --> 02:00:52,644
He told them everything...

1241
02:00:52,767 --> 02:00:53,711
He's lying!

1242
02:00:53,767 --> 02:00:55,178
He's lying!
It is not my fault...

1243
02:00:55,334 --> 02:00:56,210
It was all his fault...

1244
02:00:56,267 --> 02:00:57,405
Why are you lying?!

1245
02:00:58,567 --> 02:00:59,409
Darn!

1246
02:01:01,267 --> 02:01:02,473
Grab the gun... Quick!

1247
02:01:10,700 --> 02:01:11,610
Want some of this?

1248
02:01:17,467 --> 02:01:18,605
Chutzpah!

1249
02:01:18,767 --> 02:01:19,575
Run...

1250
02:01:23,667 --> 02:01:24,873
Run...

1251
02:01:25,134 --> 02:01:25,669
Run Salman, run!

1252
02:01:29,167 --> 02:01:30,237
Up... Salman!

1253
02:01:31,301 --> 02:01:32,439
Watch out!

1254
02:01:43,434 --> 02:01:44,572
Salman!

1255
02:01:47,067 --> 02:01:49,206
Salman!

1256
02:02:42,267 --> 02:02:43,177
- Hello...

1257
02:02:43,601 --> 02:02:44,739
- Khurram is still alive.

1258
02:02:45,167 --> 02:02:46,510
- But I've killed three cops.

1259
02:02:46,567 --> 02:02:48,103
I heard...

1260
02:02:48,301 --> 02:02:49,302
Where are you now?

1261
02:02:49,367 --> 02:02:50,675
On the Pampore highway.

1262
02:02:51,034 --> 02:02:52,012
Stay on the line.

1263
02:02:53,234 --> 02:02:54,611
It's the doctor's son...

1264
02:02:58,534 --> 02:02:59,569
Send him across the border...

1265
02:03:02,534 --> 02:03:04,673
You'll need go across
the border for training.

1266
02:03:05,534 --> 02:03:08,413
Get to the graveyard
where we met first.

1267
02:03:08,534 --> 02:03:10,013
- We'll get in touch...

1268
02:03:10,334 --> 02:03:11,312
Alright.

1269
02:03:11,967 --> 02:03:13,037
Bye.

1270
02:03:27,034 --> 02:03:28,035
Hello.

1271
02:03:29,067 --> 02:03:31,274
Hello...

1272
02:03:42,200 --> 02:03:43,645
Hello Haider...

1273
02:03:47,901 --> 02:03:50,074
Where are you?
In the hospital?

1274
02:03:51,067 --> 02:03:53,138
- Haider...

1275
02:03:54,001 --> 02:03:57,073
There were other ways to pan...

1276
02:04:00,301 --> 02:04:02,907
Why did you have
to get my father killed?

1277
02:04:03,367 --> 02:04:05,210
God!

1278
02:04:06,967 --> 02:04:08,446
This is not true!

1279
02:04:09,201 --> 02:04:11,306
I swear upon God...
this is not true!

1280
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:19,411
I'm going mother.

1281
02:04:20,468 --> 02:04:21,412
Where?

1282
02:04:25,401 --> 02:04:27,642
You're crossing the border?

1283
02:04:34,001 --> 02:04:37,346
It is a fatal trek..
I won't bear losing you..

1284
02:04:44,368 --> 02:04:48,339
At least, meet me once...
I won't stop you this time.

1285
02:04:48,401 --> 02:04:49,277
I promise...

1286
02:04:49,834 --> 02:04:51,541
- Meet me once.

1287
02:04:55,100 --> 02:04:57,376
Meet me once.

1288
02:05:47,501 --> 02:05:49,538
- My two-faced mother.

1289
02:05:55,168 --> 02:06:00,880
Such innocence in one face;
such deceit in the other...

1290
02:06:01,001 --> 02:06:04,778
We are not to be blamed
for the doctor's death

1291
02:06:07,401 --> 02:06:11,440
Oh! How sad to see a mother lie...

1292
02:06:12,800 --> 02:06:15,872
The flowers on father's grave
were still fresh...

1293
02:06:15,934 --> 02:06:18,175
and you rushed into
Khurram's marital bed.

1294
02:06:19,967 --> 02:06:26,942
The world knows you and Khurram
conspired to murder my father.

1295
02:06:27,300 --> 02:06:29,075
These are utter lies...

1296
02:06:34,367 --> 02:06:35,402
Mother...

1297
02:06:37,334 --> 02:06:41,077
Ikhlaq was hiding in our
house that fateful day...

1298
02:06:41,134 --> 02:06:43,171
only you knew that.

1299
02:06:44,867 --> 02:06:48,542
Khurram was an informant
for the army...

1300
02:06:48,767 --> 02:06:52,909
and you were his informer.

1301
02:07:07,101 --> 02:07:08,011
Hello.

1302
02:07:08,101 --> 02:07:10,479
You're home?

1303
02:07:12,234 --> 02:07:14,271
Then what's that shining in the sky?

1304
02:07:20,001 --> 02:07:21,981
I'm scared Khurram.

1305
02:07:22,934 --> 02:07:23,537
What happened?

1306
02:07:24,500 --> 02:07:27,174
Hilaal's brought Ikhlaq home today.

1307
02:07:28,767 --> 02:07:30,144
Ikhlaq Latif!

1308
02:07:32,167 --> 02:07:35,546
I had no idea that
Khurram was an informant.

1309
02:07:37,334 --> 02:07:41,214
I never wanted to harm
your father.

1310
02:07:44,100 --> 02:07:46,376
I did not hate him.

1311
02:07:52,068 --> 02:07:53,479
And Khurram?

1312
02:08:03,300 --> 02:08:05,302
How did you feel for Khurram?

1313
02:08:24,001 --> 02:08:24,911
Wait...

1314
02:08:24,967 --> 02:08:26,173
Stop the jeep...

1315
02:08:44,234 --> 02:08:46,737
I'll wait eagerly...

1316
02:08:47,700 --> 02:08:49,907
For you to be a widow again.

1317
02:08:53,034 --> 02:08:56,811
My angel, will you do me
one last favor?

1318
02:08:58,834 --> 02:09:01,041
I am tired of my wretched life...

1319
02:09:06,334 --> 02:09:07,404
End my agony!

1320
02:09:09,900 --> 02:09:12,346
Your life is your punishment.

1321
02:09:36,034 --> 02:09:38,344
Differentiation is
the unique element...

1322
02:09:38,400 --> 02:09:40,402
It is important to be unique
at something that is...

1323
02:09:40,634 --> 02:09:42,238
valuable to your customers...

1324
02:09:45,700 --> 02:09:48,010
Lakshmi, I told you not to put
any calls through...

1325
02:09:48,634 --> 02:09:49,203
Who?

1326
02:09:51,134 --> 02:09:52,340
Yes, put him through...

1327
02:09:54,234 --> 02:09:55,144
Hello...

1328
02:10:24,734 --> 02:10:26,645
You're equally responsible
for this death...

1329
02:10:30,767 --> 02:10:33,008
Despite everything ...

1330
02:10:33,734 --> 02:10:35,736
you went to see him...

1331
02:10:37,901 --> 02:10:39,812
without telling me...

1332
02:10:41,034 --> 02:10:45,176
Your son has crossed over
to the other side...

1333
02:10:49,867 --> 02:10:52,541
He's become a bloodthirsty animal.

1334
02:10:55,968 --> 02:10:58,881
Yes... but at least
he's not a snake in the grass.

1335
02:11:55,800 --> 02:12:00,715
Where is Haider?
- Liyaqat... calm down.

1336
02:12:00,767 --> 02:12:04,112
Where is he?
- Liyaqat... calm down.

1337
02:12:04,167 --> 02:12:08,172
Wherever he is...
he will not survive.

1338
02:12:16,001 --> 02:12:21,883
I won't stop till
I put him in a coffin.

1339
02:13:35,600 --> 02:13:37,944
Both of them had
guns in their hands...

1340
02:13:39,601 --> 02:13:42,411
If Haider wouldn't
have fired first...

1341
02:13:42,900 --> 02:13:45,506
Pan/ez would have.

1342
02:14:00,834 --> 02:14:02,905
Everyone wants to kill him.

1343
02:14:06,034 --> 02:14:08,605
I know he won't make it

1344
02:14:30,367 --> 02:14:32,404
The doctor's wife on the line.

1345
02:14:35,967 --> 02:14:37,446
Roohdaar...

1346
02:14:37,600 --> 02:14:38,908
- Who is this?

1347
02:14:38,967 --> 02:14:40,378
Ghazala...

1348
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:42,502
Ghazala Meer...

1349
02:14:57,334 --> 02:14:59,405
Oh, why don't you come...

1350
02:14:59,434 --> 02:15:01,380
My dearly departed ...

1351
02:15:01,434 --> 02:15:03,573
Where you are now...

1352
02:15:03,634 --> 02:15:04,874
Sleep.

1353
02:15:05,801 --> 02:15:07,838
Oh, why don't you come...

1354
02:15:07,901 --> 02:15:09,881
My tired one...

1355
02:15:09,934 --> 02:15:11,811
My life...

1356
02:15:11,867 --> 02:15:13,278
Just sleep.

1357
02:15:14,334 --> 02:15:16,974
Not twilight or sunset...

1358
02:15:18,500 --> 02:15:20,844
Just darkness, only darkness...

1359
02:15:22,667 --> 02:15:24,669
Not twilight or sunset...

1360
02:15:24,734 --> 02:15:26,771
Just darkness, only darkness...

1361
02:15:26,834 --> 02:15:28,575
A nest for your soul...

1362
02:15:28,634 --> 02:15:30,944
So rest, just sleep.

1363
02:15:31,001 --> 02:15:35,677
Oh, why don't you come...

1364
02:15:39,734 --> 02:15:43,841
No one is deep or shallow...
No giants or dwan/es here...

1365
02:15:48,167 --> 02:15:52,616
In the nests of a grave...
Only the deep sleep exists...

1366
02:15:54,367 --> 02:15:57,211
No beds, no breakfast...

1367
02:15:58,401 --> 02:16:00,472
No bags, no baggage...

1368
02:16:00,534 --> 02:16:03,708
Only an angel's lullaby...
So sleep...

1369
02:16:04,667 --> 02:16:09,343
Oh, why don't you come...

1370
02:16:13,201 --> 02:16:17,650
Come home...

1371
02:16:20,867 --> 02:16:23,575
Haider...
Where have you been?

1372
02:16:23,634 --> 02:16:27,776
We have been waiting for you.

1373
02:16:27,834 --> 02:16:31,372
Dig a grave and rest...

1374
02:16:49,201 --> 02:16:52,546
Grandpa, Why do skulls
keep grinning?

1375
02:16:52,601 --> 02:16:54,239
Your skull will surely
be a brooding one.

1376
02:16:54,301 --> 02:16:55,507
Shut up and eat.

1377
02:16:55,901 --> 02:16:59,678
The dead know they never lived fully.

1378
02:17:00,867 --> 02:17:03,211
And it never stops with death...

1379
02:17:03,267 --> 02:17:04,302
Got it?

1380
02:17:06,201 --> 02:17:07,942
The body turns into soil...

1381
02:17:08,200 --> 02:17:11,670
the soil is,
turned into pots and toys...

1382
02:17:11,734 --> 02:17:15,682
You maybe Alexander or Akbar...
Hitler or Gandhi...

1383
02:17:15,867 --> 02:17:17,744
all that remains is dust.

1384
02:17:18,734 --> 02:17:21,681
Who knows... this flask your grandpa
is sewing tea from...

1385
02:17:21,734 --> 02:17:24,340
might be made of some dust
from Alexander's body...

1386
02:17:26,167 --> 02:17:28,670
He may have conquered the world...

1387
02:17:28,734 --> 02:17:32,204
but today he's sewing
tea in a graveyard.

1388
02:18:03,167 --> 02:18:04,475
Whose funeral is it?

1389
02:18:07,467 --> 02:18:08,673
A dead person's...

1390
02:18:09,434 --> 02:18:10,538
Will you have some tea?

1391
02:18:20,834 --> 02:18:22,279
Is it a woman's?

1392
02:18:22,334 --> 02:18:25,281
How does it matter?

1393
02:18:25,300 --> 02:18:27,280
Let's go and eat...

1394
02:18:27,867 --> 02:18:29,107
Come along, son...

1395
02:18:29,401 --> 02:18:30,175
Come along.

1396
02:18:31,567 --> 02:18:32,739
- Haider, come now...

1397
02:18:37,300 --> 02:18:38,244
- Haider!

1398
02:18:41,167 --> 02:18:42,077
Arshee...

1399
02:18:42,634 --> 02:18:43,544
- Haider...

1400
02:18:50,701 --> 02:18:51,406
Haider!

1401
02:18:52,101 --> 02:18:52,704
Haider...

1402
02:18:53,334 --> 02:18:55,610
Stop Haider... don't go there...
Listen to me...

1403
02:18:56,100 --> 02:18:58,171
Haider... don't go there...

1404
02:18:58,234 --> 02:19:00,236
They will kill you...

1405
02:19:00,601 --> 02:19:01,477
Haider...

1406
02:19:03,700 --> 02:19:04,644
Arshee...

1407
02:19:07,501 --> 02:19:08,377
Arshee!

1408
02:19:09,067 --> 02:19:10,102
Arshee!

1409
02:19:10,567 --> 02:19:14,242
Arshee!
- Control yourself...

1410
02:20:40,901 --> 02:20:42,642
- Come what may...

1411
02:20:43,034 --> 02:20:44,513
- the boy should live...

1412
02:20:45,667 --> 02:20:48,113
Get out of there now.

1413
02:20:48,900 --> 02:20:50,971
We have too many
weapons Zahoor...

1414
02:20:51,034 --> 02:20:52,570
they won't fit in the car.

1415
02:20:53,534 --> 02:20:55,673
Take whatever you can. Leave!

1416
02:20:55,933 --> 02:20:56,673
NOW!

1417
02:21:13,534 --> 02:21:17,209
- Zahoor... it is too late.

1418
02:21:35,067 --> 02:21:36,444
- Liyaqat...

1419
02:22:20,833 --> 02:22:21,607
Muzamil!

1420
02:22:23,301 --> 02:22:24,871
There's a whole battalion inside...

1421
02:22:25,234 --> 02:22:26,406
You said he was alone...

1422
02:22:26,467 --> 02:22:27,878
I didn't know, sir...

1423
02:22:31,267 --> 02:22:32,268
Throw a grenade...

1424
02:23:15,500 --> 02:23:16,808
- Brother...

1425
02:23:17,867 --> 02:23:19,073
- Brother...

1426
02:23:48,834 --> 02:23:51,405
- Bring the rocket launcher here!

1427
02:24:05,167 --> 02:24:07,078
- Rocket launcher loaded!

1428
02:24:08,800 --> 02:24:09,744
Fire...

1429
02:24:09,967 --> 02:24:11,105
Fire!

1430
02:24:20,234 --> 02:24:23,147
You were to fire in the middle!
- Muzamil...

1431
02:24:30,001 --> 02:24:32,106
Take the whole darn house down...

1432
02:24:32,467 --> 02:24:33,844
Yes, sir!

1433
02:24:37,067 --> 02:24:38,273
Load up...

1434
02:24:43,800 --> 02:24:45,040
Loaded, sir!

1435
02:25:01,233 --> 02:25:02,974
What are you doing here?

1436
02:25:05,967 --> 02:25:08,208
Please spare my son.

1437
02:25:10,233 --> 02:25:13,009
I'll get him to surrender...

1438
02:25:27,134 --> 02:25:30,115
If you truly love me,
give me one chance.

1439
02:25:43,634 --> 02:25:44,977
- My angel!

1440
02:25:48,300 --> 02:25:49,938
My angel!

1441
02:26:10,567 --> 02:26:11,978
My angel!

1442
02:26:35,067 --> 02:26:38,947
If you got so much as
a scratch as a child...

1443
02:26:39,967 --> 02:26:42,277
I'd tear apart the world...

1444
02:26:44,001 --> 02:26:48,973
You are now covered in blood and...

1445
02:26:50,567 --> 02:26:53,571
I can't do a thing.

1446
02:26:58,101 --> 02:27:00,672
Mother... I won't surrender.

1447
02:27:03,900 --> 02:27:07,313
Don't you want to see me
as a widow again?

1448
02:27:15,134 --> 02:27:16,977
Angel...

1449
02:27:22,700 --> 02:27:26,011
There's no greater pain...

1450
02:27:26,601 --> 02:27:29,343
than to see the corpse
of your child.

1451
02:27:32,167 --> 02:27:33,703
There is...

1452
02:27:36,334 --> 02:27:40,146
To die without avenging
the murder of one's father.

1453
02:27:52,833 --> 02:27:57,248
Revenge begets revenge...

1454
02:27:58,834 --> 02:28:02,714
Revenge does not set us free...

1455
02:28:03,767 --> 02:28:06,941
Freedom lies beyond revenge.

1456
02:28:07,867 --> 02:28:09,676
True freedom.

1457
02:28:17,901 --> 02:28:22,179
I beg you drop your weapons,
surrender... or else...

1458
02:28:24,167 --> 02:28:25,669
Or else?

1459
02:28:28,901 --> 02:28:30,676
You won't live through it?

1460
02:31:44,734 --> 02:31:46,475
- Mother!

1461
02:31:48,500 --> 02:31:49,877
Mother!

1462
02:31:52,001 --> 02:31:53,309
Mother!

1463
02:32:11,400 --> 02:32:12,640
Mother!

1464
02:33:18,733 --> 02:33:19,711
"Haider..."

1465
02:33:19,800 --> 02:33:23,338
