1
00:05:16,518 --> 00:05:19,715
See this...
Such skilful and intricate work.

2
00:05:19,975 --> 00:05:21,472
Must be frightfully eXpensive!

3
00:05:39,096 --> 00:05:41,578
Here...
touch it...

4
00:05:45,849 --> 00:05:46,597
Is it real?

5
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:48,578
Of course madam,

6
00:05:49,365 --> 00:05:51,542
that's the fur of a Kashmir foX.

7
00:06:08,817 --> 00:06:10,198
Oh, what's so beautifiul?

8
00:06:10,406 --> 00:06:12,107
Can be anything madam...

9
00:06:12,568 --> 00:06:14,881
You can keep your jewelry in it.

10
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:16,703
Good for cigars, hmm...

11
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:49,212

Put these aside...we need them

21
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:15,324
Ah! Gopal.
- Is something wrong?

22
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:20,535
No. -They seemed suckers...

23
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:23,034
Why didn't we show them our stuff?

24
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:29,569
The boss is a sharp cookie,
he may have sent them

25
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:31,006
You mean that bastard...

26
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,380
Cut it out she might be listening

27
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,497
She's smartly dressed today.

28
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:52,502
Hmm. And unusually busy too!

29
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:06,978
Is Arvind Sahib coming today?

30
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:09,345
Why?

31
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:12,981
We thought perhaps you'd know.

32
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:23,557
Oh! Oh! Then tell us what you do know

33
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:36,472
ls Mahesh there? Call him!

34
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:38,340
The boss is on the line!

35
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:44,010
Yes Uncle, Mahesh here.

36
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,247
Has Arvind come?

37
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:48,958
Was he supposed to?

38
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:51,183
Yes. Have him call me back.

39
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:53,321
Don't forget

40
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,087
My snake will take your live!

41
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:24,890
Has everyone spat out their paan?

42
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,226
Yes, boss! Now
display your great talent!

43
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:31,200
Oh! You respectful viewers.

44
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:34,429
You've heard of the battle

45
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:37,899
of Alexander and Porus...

46
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:40,603
of the Kauravas and Pandavas...

47
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,643
of India and Pakistan

48
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,042
and the Film stars... Hema and Dharam!

49
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,977
Now watch the battle...
of the snake and the mongoose

50
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:51,883
Move back! Give them a hand!

51
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:53,615
Clap with one hand!

52
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:03,958
Driving a bloody handcart?

53
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,865
Is this road your
father's private property?

54
00:14:14,803 --> 00:14:15,891
Hello Arvind ji,

55
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:17,916
Hello, anything specific?

56
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,181
We were around here,
thought of dropping by

57
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:23,436
Your father wants you to phone him.

58
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:26,538
Yes, what can I do for you?

59
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:32,359
You tell us...
everything going fine at your end?

60
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,044
How are you parents?

61
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,208
They are fine. And you?

62
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:39,222
Fine thank you. Meet my partner.

63
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:40,922
So you work together?
- Yes.

64
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,119
Can we discuss some business?

65
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,899
We placed an order.
The goods haven't come!

66
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:57,029
There's been a slight delay.

67
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:59,841
The craftsman's are agitating, Sir.

68
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:06,976
They are under control now,
but we need your advice.

69
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,544
What's the problem?

70
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:12,547
They're demanding higher wages

71
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:15,485
and threatening to stop work.

72
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:17,588
They've done it before,

73
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:20,558
but this time... the
situation is serious

74
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,240
Don't they deserve more?

75
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:32,567
We both exist on
their labour, don't we?

76
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:34,800
You're absolutely right, sir.

77
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:37,512
So, what's the problem?

78
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:41,142
But, if you can
increase our margins...

79
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:57,199
if you can increase rates

80
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,327
I'm paying you more
than the market rate.

81
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,300
But you'll never reduce your profits.

82
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:06,810
You're worse than me!

83
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:11,908
But please consider it, sir -I have.

84
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:16,411
Either you choose a new
client or new craftsmen.

85
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:15,244
Where are we going?
- Lunch.

86
00:17:17,974 --> 00:17:20,559
Oh, come on...
You are with boss now.

87
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,282
I'm sorry! I was only joking!

88
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,995
Sorry...Sorry...sorry!

89
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:51,013
How pretentious! Classical music!

90
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,877
Here ragas are
played only at lunch.

91
00:17:55,573 --> 00:17:57,849
Morning ragas...
evening ragas...night ragas.

92
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,320
Music, the great appetizer.

93
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:07,263
Who's that?

94
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:09,799
An acquaintance.

95
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:12,502
He's a demolition contractor

96
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,429
He used to handle
the bulldozer himself

97
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:17,199
Now he has employees to do it.

98
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:21,439
He can demolish any slum
in half an hour.

99
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,247
We're very clean people, aren't we?

100
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:30,478
We cannot stomach squalor.

101
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:34,215
If we can't get rid of it,

102
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,190
we cover it with paint, perfume

103
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:38,221
...beautify the shit!

104
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:41,356
So do we also become a part of it?

105
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,356
Not you, silly...

106
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,104
I was talking generally...
perhaps only about myself.

107
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:03,281
Some friends - in advertising.
They sell everything.

108
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,089
We won't come here again.
-Why?

109
00:19:06,511 --> 00:19:08,457
You know too many people here.

110
00:19:09,491 --> 00:19:10,171
Who cares?

111
00:19:12,642 --> 00:19:13,918
Perhaps I care.

112
00:19:20,877 --> 00:19:22,782
I wish I had some more time,

113
00:19:23,294 --> 00:19:25,137
But this shop is like a trap.

114
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:29,278
If Mahesh showed more
interest I'd be free.

115
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:32,311
Perhaps he has other interests...

116
00:19:34,393 --> 00:19:35,226
How much?

117
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:53,798
You remember, don't you...

118
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:56,065
my mother has invited
you for lunch on Sunday?

119
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:58,165
Can we make it next Sunday?
- Why?

120
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:00,501
I will be busy this sunday.

121
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:02,939
I'm not returning to the office now.

122
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:07,112
You know where to contact me.

123
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:21,324
Oh Samba!

124
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,832
All over the countryside

125
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,434
Mother's warn crying children

126
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:28,164
by Saying Hush,

127
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,900
Gabbar Singh will hear you!

128
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,940
Here comes your sucker!!

129
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:39,910
So, you're rehearsing dialogue?

130
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:41,243
Want to be a hero in movies?

131
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:43,918
No, the villain!

132
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:47,251
Okay, I'll find you some work.

133
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,017
For now, take care of the car.

134
00:22:09,949 --> 00:22:14,584
(Sound of prayers being recited...)

135
00:22:41,084 --> 00:22:44,052
hey Arvind, come have a seat.

136
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:55,978
How's the shop doing, son?
- Fine.

137
00:22:57,976 --> 00:23:00,217
Not thinking of scuttling it are you?

138
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:08,093
Oh, I met a friend of your.
- Who?

139
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,599
Your leftist college friend.
What's his name?

140
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,398
Rajan.

141
00:23:14,098 --> 00:23:15,050
Met him today.

142
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:17,971
I gave him a lift to the university.

143
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:19,803
He teaches there.

144
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:25,174
He must have come back.
He used to be in Calcutta.

145
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,020
I have to go out.

146
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:44,932
By the way, how's Alice?

147
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:47,899
She's fine.

148
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,207
Gather round, all you people.

149
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:06,017
This is pure butter... unadulterated.

150
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:08,282
Prepared before your eyes.

151
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:10,359
He gives you strength.

152
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:14,958
Men's chest will expand...
filled with more power...

153
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,363
And their erections last longer.

154
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:20,503
Gather round friends, brothers...

155
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,414
Hi fatso! What brings you here?

156
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:08,849
Why? ls visiting cousins forbidden?

157
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,984
You've lost weight?

158
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:16,156
You measure the world
by your proportions!

159
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,486
Should I send for a snack?

160
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:20,924
I don't see my brother around.

161
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:23,793
He may come in the afternoon.
Who knows?

162
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,498
I'm having a Party-

163
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:30,170
I'd like to take a few things.
- Sure!

164
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:37,908
How are things with you?
Still going to club?

165
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,793
Maybe this will be better...

166
00:26:27,096 --> 00:26:29,273
You want to take these too, kya?

167
00:26:32,227 --> 00:26:35,220
This might be nice,
you can wrap it around.

168
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:47,042
How do I look?
- Fantastic...

169
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:51,116
But if it was 7 years earlier...

170
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,058
Have these packed...

171
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:29,224
Is it a...business party?
- Yes.

172
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:36,125
How did Sunil's export deal go?

173
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:39,401
What does Arvind do all the day?

174
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:43,428
Who knows? He comes and goes.

175
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:48,077
He's your brother, after all.

176
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:50,859
Thank you.
- You are welcome.

177
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:23,470
When did you return to Bombay?

178
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:26,473
6 or 7 months ago.

179
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,950
What are you doing these days?

180
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:31,986
What else? Teaching.

181
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:37,951
Just like before.

182
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:42,354
Now, I have a right to.

183
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:45,195
I'm officially a teacher.

184
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:48,365
What about you?

185
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:52,374
The same family business.
What else can I do?

186
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,341
I met your father.

187
00:28:58,002 --> 00:28:59,379
Hmm. He said so

188
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:03,281
I met your leftist friend.
What's his name?

189
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:08,414
That man has a strange sense of power.

190
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,389
which is slightly scary...

191
00:29:11,615 --> 00:29:13,411
Yeah, I also feel so...

192
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:18,426
If I had to live with him,
it would kill me.

193
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:25,072
This bloody city, I hate it.

194
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:29,478
Hate is good for one's health.

195
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:31,774
You're making fun of me.

196
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:37,512
It's the only way to
reconcile oneself..

197
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,449
...to a dehumanised existence.

198
00:29:41,078 --> 00:29:43,058
Playing philosopher, huh?

199
00:29:43,426 --> 00:29:44,991
Sorry, my profession...

200
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:52,198
Crowds...squalor...stench...
and hideous architecture.

201
00:29:54,091 --> 00:29:56,799
Look at it this way.
As the spread of civilization.

202
00:29:56,895 --> 00:29:59,501
Its material manifestation,

203
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:06,113
according to you, all is well,
There's no problem

204
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:09,382
Every effect has a cause.

205
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:12,446
You still remember...

206
00:30:12,495 --> 00:30:14,468
We have to take the neXt left

207
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:16,388
Where exactly do you live?

208
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:20,193
Close by. I've rented a room.

209
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:24,231
The landlady is eccentric
but doesn't interfere with me.

210
00:30:26,845 --> 00:30:27,661
Right here.

211
00:30:30,933 --> 00:30:33,314
Rajan, how do you spend your time?

212
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:39,648
Reading preparing for my classes.
Sometimes students come by.

213
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:42,543
You were always organized.

214
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:47,513
And you?
- Disorganized.

215
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:58,130
Won't you come in?
- Some other time.

216
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:02,231
I want to talk to you.
- Sure.

217
00:31:02,622 --> 00:31:05,615
You know the place,
drop by when you can...

218
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:08,500
Any evening or on a Sunday.

219
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:10,910
I'll come on Sunday. Definitely.

220
00:31:11,398 --> 00:31:13,643
Then we can have a chat.
- Sure.

221
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:07,052
Oh Fatima!

222
00:35:23,626 --> 00:35:24,642
Do it faster...

223
00:35:25,156 --> 00:35:28,160
It's her boss who's coming...
...and I who have to work.

224
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:29,967
Mama is my tea ready?
- Yes.

225
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:31,199
Let her sleep

226
00:35:31,261 --> 00:35:34,970
She only gets one day to rest

227
00:35:35,319 --> 00:35:39,673
So what can we do?
Does she help out when my friends come over?

228
00:35:40,004 --> 00:35:41,915
What about my breakfast?

229
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,484
Must I skip it for one bloody boss?

230
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:46,488
A delay of 5 minutes won't kill you.

231
00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:47,988
Put that radio off!

232
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:51,219
I'm jobless so I get sermons.

233
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:55,525
Once I get work, I'll eat,
drink, live it up.

234
00:36:02,931 --> 00:36:04,700
Mama, where is that kokum?

235
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:14,840
Look, Mama! He's
talking to that bum again!

236
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:19,345
Stop yelling Mama!

237
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:22,981
Go and get some kokum!

238
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:29,564
Ah! You've woken up early today!

239
00:36:30,054 --> 00:36:32,227
Mama! Tea for Alice!

240
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:39,368
May I come late tomorrow?
- Why?

241
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,831
My sister is in town...
thought I'd show her around.

242
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:44,906
Or else she'll go back and
complain she saw nothing.

243
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,810
I'll have to face the family.

244
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:50,207
You're concerned about them?

245
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:54,807
When you are in need, they
are the only ones who help.

246
00:37:55,173 --> 00:37:57,282
  Friends... have fun, and leave.

247
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:12,229
What are you looking at?
- Nothing!

248
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,933
All you can do is look, my friend.

249
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:16,197
She's the limousine kind.

250
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,398
What a bloody life!

251
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:22,342
What do you want out of life?
- What don't I want?

252
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:27,405
A big car, chauffeur driven...

253
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:31,813
A beautiful and innocent
girl by my side.

254
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:37,025
The car drives along the shore...
climbs a hill...

255
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:41,358
a huge gate opens... the
doorman salutes...wow!

256
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:43,361
How do you intend to get all this?

257
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:45,594
You'll see. A little work...

258
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,894
underhand deals...

259
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:50,871
and wherever necessary
a little flattery...

260
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:53,602
That's just what we're doing...
It does not work.

261
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:56,568
You have to be entirely ruthless...

262
00:38:56,948 --> 00:39:01,090
Kill when necessary...
and then you make money.

263
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,843
From that money you make more money

264
00:39:05,161 --> 00:39:05,942
and...

265
00:39:10,864 --> 00:39:14,469
C'mon, the stop has come...
You have the tickets na?

266
00:39:57,079 --> 00:39:59,813
Oh, Arvind...
come..

267
00:40:09,539 --> 00:40:12,850
Sit Arvind.
I'll just finish my exercises.

268
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:02,097
What's so funny?

269
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,001
You and exercise.

270
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:12,242
Why?
- Nothing, it just looks funny.

271
00:41:41,398 --> 00:41:45,540
Whose paint...drawing is this?
- Mine.

272
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:47,941
No, I meant the artist?

273
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:52,152
A friend of mine.

274
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,991
Like it?
- Yes...it's interesting?

275
00:41:57,414 --> 00:42:00,122
Why?

276
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:06,095
It seems strangely cruel.

277
00:42:06,859 --> 00:42:08,288
What kind of cruelty?

278
00:42:10,687 --> 00:42:13,476
As if someone wants
to finish everything.

279
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:33,190
What is it destroying?

280
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,465
I'm not an intellectual, like you.

281
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,204
I like it, so I said so.

282
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:51,345
I've got to go.

283
00:42:51,928 --> 00:42:53,490
Lunch appointment?

284
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:58,114
Just my secretary's family.
I'm having lunch with them.

285
00:43:05,215 --> 00:43:08,025
What's the artist's name?
- Why?

286
00:43:08,118 --> 00:43:12,533
Who knows?
I might buy his work.

287
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:15,595
Back to business, eh!

288
00:43:30,808 --> 00:43:34,051
You did remind him, didn't you?

289
00:43:34,211 --> 00:43:37,192
He said, he would come.

290
00:44:00,857 --> 00:44:02,966
What does he think of himself?

291
00:44:02,919 --> 00:44:05,572
He has come, he has come.
-Okay, Okay.

292
00:44:07,685 --> 00:44:08,297
Bernie...

293
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:12,185
Alright, I'll wear that damn shirt!

294
00:44:22,893 --> 00:44:24,566
Hello auntie, how's everyone?

295
00:44:24,795 --> 00:44:26,297
Fine...

296
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:30,872
Will you...have some brandy?

297
00:44:30,934 --> 00:44:33,346
No thanks.
I never drink before sunset.

298
00:44:34,381 --> 00:44:35,946
Hello Joan
- Hi Arvind

299
00:44:40,006 --> 00:44:41,435
For you
- Thank you.

300
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:42,708
Hi Bernie.
-Hi.

301
00:44:43,447 --> 00:44:46,121
I'm famished! Shall we eat?

302
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,516
Mummy, perfume...

303
00:44:47,583 --> 00:44:50,427
Oh! Why did you bother?

304
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:52,591
Come, have a seat...

305
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:00,370
Joan, how's your typing getting on?

306
00:45:00,657 --> 00:45:02,062
Ok
- What ok?

307
00:45:03,209 --> 00:45:06,882
You should be an eXpert by now...
60, 70, 80 words...

308
00:45:07,237 --> 00:45:10,775
I want a perfect secretary,
...not like your sister!

309
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:18,882
You're not eating anything.
- Why don't you eat Mama?

310
00:45:21,818 --> 00:45:25,356
Do you like our cooking?
There's nothing special, though.

311
00:45:25,401 --> 00:45:26,830
The food is eXcellent

312
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:29,530
Who did the cooking?
- Mama and I.

313
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:31,931
Mama and I!

314
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:36,306
You couldn't have done it!
- Ask Mama! Mama!

315
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:39,946
And, what about you, Bernie?

316
00:45:40,104 --> 00:45:42,345
Me, nothing!

317
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:45,882
He has bought a new bullworker.

318
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,527
Do you eat fish at home?
- No.

319
00:45:53,884 --> 00:45:56,888
Have some more, then.
- No thanks, I've done well.

320
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:01,798
Joan, just give him a towel.

321
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:26,118
Would you like some tea?

322
00:46:26,216 --> 00:46:28,856
A cigarette is just fine.

323
00:46:36,493 --> 00:46:39,372
Of course, must you ask!

324
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:53,078
You'll be back soon, won't you?
- Yes, Mama.

325
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:21,508
Rai Saheb, Isn't that you daughter, Maya?
- Yes. I brought her along today.

326
00:47:22,806 --> 00:47:27,346
Wasn't she studying abroad?
-Yes.

327
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:35,459
In Paris...at Sorbonne.

328
00:47:36,987 --> 00:47:39,092
She has just returned.

329
00:47:39,208 --> 00:47:42,473
She has really grown into
a beautiful young lady.

330
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:45,262
But why is she all alone outside?

331
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:48,310
She says she has no one to talk to.

332
00:47:49,233 --> 00:47:51,440
Perhaps it's because of Paris.

333
00:47:51,501 --> 00:47:57,076
She's right. After Paris,
she's bound to feel that way here.

334
00:47:57,608 --> 00:47:59,144
What were her subjects?

335
00:47:59,243 --> 00:48:01,245
She went to learn music...

336
00:48:01,345 --> 00:48:03,484
but was drawn to painting...

337
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:06,559
Paris is like that.

338
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:11,797
Come over and see her work.

339
00:48:12,522 --> 00:48:15,298
I've always believed
that the new generation...

340
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:18,271
should be introduced
to art and culture

341
00:48:18,328 --> 00:48:25,439
You're right. But today's
youth is running madly after money.

342
00:48:25,769 --> 00:48:30,411
On these very lawns we've seen
Shakespeare being performed...

343
00:48:37,047 --> 00:48:38,890
Those days are over.

344
00:48:39,049 --> 00:48:42,462
That was an age but today.

345
00:48:43,539 --> 00:48:44,039
Hello

346
00:48:45,935 --> 00:48:48,180
How are you Rai Saheb,
Seth ji?

347
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:52,407
How are things young man?
- Alright!

348
00:48:52,499 --> 00:48:55,492
eXcept for that bloody
strike in the factory.

349
00:48:55,572 --> 00:48:56,524
Strike again?

350
00:48:56,867 --> 00:48:58,346
Don't talk about it...

351
00:48:58,775 --> 00:49:02,472
Those bloody outside agitators...
Professional Termites...

352
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:05,816
Who? Communists?
- Who else!

353
00:49:06,076 --> 00:49:09,956
To me, anyone who
agitates is a communist.

354
00:49:10,847 --> 00:49:13,225
Basically, we're lazy people.

355
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:17,123
I'm not joking.
Really. No one wants to work.

356
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:20,029
All they want is higher wages,
bigger bonuses.

357
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:29,101
A strong hand with a whip. Then watch!

358
00:49:30,767 --> 00:49:32,474
Put it there!
- Why?

359
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:34,845
I'm expecting guests...

360
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:38,148
There they have come.

361
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:41,489
I tell you-
we need a strong man with a whip.

362
00:49:50,253 --> 00:49:52,529
A lovely name
- Maya!

363
00:50:06,536 --> 00:50:08,015
Whenever I meet a beautiful boy...

364
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:09,414
That's when I'll get married.

365
00:50:09,473 --> 00:50:13,080
O give me a radio. For
a radio I'm willing.

366
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:21,019
I don't need beads of baubles
for baubles, I'm not willing.

367
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:27,197
Whenever I meet a milkman
That's when I'll get married.

368
00:50:27,257 --> 00:50:29,567
O give me a radio

369
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:34,534
Why are you silent?

370
00:51:41,565 --> 00:51:44,409
For a year we've known each other...

371
00:51:44,501 --> 00:51:47,277
And yet I don't know
anything about you.

372
00:51:50,808 --> 00:51:52,645
We are absolute strangers.

373
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:59,859
Now tell me, what do
you think about me?

374
00:52:03,253 --> 00:52:04,789
I like you.

375
00:52:05,922 --> 00:52:08,163
That's all? Nothing more?

376
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:11,066
Isn't that enough?

377
00:52:11,595 --> 00:52:16,340
No. Tell me what you find in me?

378
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,573
A lot.

379
00:52:19,236 --> 00:52:22,217
You mean a good job...
benefits, expensive meals...

380
00:52:22,349 --> 00:52:24,254
Arun, Please don't say that.

381
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:28,846
If someone offered you more...

382
00:52:28,912 --> 00:52:31,950
...would you start a
similar relationship?

383
00:52:36,853 --> 00:52:43,168
Aren't you like most women,
out for a rich catch?

384
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:45,063
No matter what he's like?

385
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,954
What, if we got married?

386
00:53:01,912 --> 00:53:03,516
Is it possible?

387
00:55:56,787 --> 00:55:58,425
What is this cheque for?

388
00:56:09,436 --> 00:56:11,069
Meerabehn Charity Trust.

389
00:56:11,935 --> 00:56:17,180
Three thousand! Your
demands keep increasing.

390
00:56:18,742 --> 00:56:21,655
These religious donations...
are getting out of hand.

391
00:56:22,846 --> 00:56:24,291
Perhaps that's our salvation.

392
00:56:26,183 --> 00:56:32,828
Look; do as you please.
Pray away. Who's stopping you?

393
00:56:34,358 --> 00:56:36,964
But keep your advice
outside of business.

394
00:56:38,095 --> 00:56:42,339
Here, business is slack, and
your donations are increasing.

395
00:57:55,672 --> 00:57:56,776
Don't be upset, mother.

396
00:57:58,008 --> 00:57:59,112
That's only his manner.

397
00:58:05,682 --> 00:58:07,821
Anyway, what's the matter?

398
00:58:10,387 --> 00:58:13,197
Tell me. I'm not like him.

399
00:58:21,631 --> 00:58:22,735
Why don't you ever speak out?

400
00:59:58,864 --> 01:00:01,177
Four beers please...
Black Label.

401
01:00:07,405 --> 01:00:08,493
No need to pack.

402
01:00:19,261 --> 01:00:20,554
Sir, your change...

403
01:00:21,527 --> 01:00:22,547
Hey, let it be.

404
01:00:22,907 --> 01:00:25,492
Assholes have problem
taking money too.

405
01:01:04,828 --> 01:01:08,037
Arvind! What have you brought?

406
01:01:08,298 --> 01:01:09,402
Some beer.

407
01:01:12,102 --> 01:01:15,208
Arvind, you haven't
met these students...

408
01:01:25,115 --> 01:01:29,188
Arvind, the glasses and opener
are on the table...could you?

409
01:01:29,550 --> 01:01:31,047
Yes, let's continue...

410
01:02:24,373 --> 01:02:26,074
Wow, this is wonderful...

411
01:02:26,326 --> 01:02:27,705
Where were we?

412
01:02:55,205 --> 01:02:59,153
How is this relevant to us?
- Good question.

413
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:02,813
That is what happened...

414
01:03:02,879 --> 01:03:05,655
Tradition forms of
production were being smashed.

415
01:03:06,049 --> 01:03:08,996
Land was being
arbitrarily distributed.

416
01:03:09,853 --> 01:03:11,890
People from villages fled to cities

417
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:16,069
industrialisation
uprooted them from their land.

418
01:03:16,126 --> 01:03:20,632
Let us get down to
concrete examples...

419
01:03:20,697 --> 01:03:23,371
How do family
relationships in industrial society...

420
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,841
...differ from earlier ones?

421
01:03:35,178 --> 01:03:38,216
Are they a
manifestation of a cosmic order?

422
01:03:38,281 --> 01:03:44,163
My friend, don't cloud issue
with metaphysical overtones...

423
01:03:44,754 --> 01:03:49,362
don't mock man's condition
with cosmic definitions.

424
01:03:50,427 --> 01:03:53,169
Man is responsible
for his own condition.

425
01:03:53,296 --> 01:03:55,401
Perhaps we are
shirking the real issue.

426
01:03:55,632 --> 01:04:00,240
Moving from feudal to
industrial society...

427
01:04:00,737 --> 01:04:06,153
...the contradictions created
are concretely manifested...

428
01:04:06,376 --> 01:04:08,253
in Kamal Swaroop.
- Who's he?

429
01:04:08,311 --> 01:04:09,949
That guy doing history.

430
01:04:35,332 --> 01:04:39,278
... because he doesn’t belong somewhere
curses himself...

431
01:04:39,238 --> 01:04:42,639
But with his silence,
he himself and the other...

432
01:05:35,662 --> 01:05:38,142
Mama! Come and eat.

433
01:05:38,067 --> 01:05:39,842
Let her come I'll eat with her.

434
01:05:42,372 --> 01:05:43,476
What hopes!

435
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:54,226
She has lots of work...
great responsibilities...

436
01:05:54,717 --> 01:05:56,253
Stop being funny.

437
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:59,266
12 hours, 13 hours, 14 hours...
- Shut up!

438
01:05:59,923 --> 01:06:00,993
Are you crazy?

439
01:06:01,057 --> 01:06:03,196
Aren't you ashamed to talk
about your sister like that!

440
01:06:04,125 --> 01:06:06,076
I have gone nuts?

441
01:06:06,930 --> 01:06:10,241
He's a nice boy
- high class!

442
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:16,866
A pack of Wills, please.

443
01:08:23,192 --> 01:08:25,369
<i>(On the radio-
This rainy night</i>

444
01:08:25,431 --> 01:08:28,816
<i>This lovely atmosphere
that lovely moon...)</i>

445
01:08:40,802 --> 01:08:42,748
Mister! Collect your cigarettes!

446
01:09:53,756 --> 01:09:56,703
Oh! What brings you here?

447
01:09:57,794 --> 01:10:00,001
You've always said I
had wheels on my feet.

448
01:10:02,799 --> 01:10:05,040
Will you eat anything?
- No thanks.

449
01:10:06,969 --> 01:10:08,243
Sit down.

450
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:11,746
We're meeting after ages, aren't we?

451
01:10:13,843 --> 01:10:16,790
I visited the shop
but you're never there.

452
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:18,284
How come you haven't gone out today?

453
01:10:19,782 --> 01:10:23,889
Sunil's gone. To a stag party.

454
01:10:33,196 --> 01:10:34,641
You're putting on weight.

455
01:10:36,365 --> 01:10:38,208
That's because I eat and drink
- regularly.

456
01:10:40,403 --> 01:10:42,007
Look at you. You're looking starved.

457
01:10:42,523 --> 01:10:44,224
You should eat regularly.

458
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:52,984
I just saw your
neighbours in the lift...

459
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:56,328
Soon you'll be like them.

460
01:10:57,653 --> 01:10:59,098
Are you equating me with them?

461
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:01,026
You don't like the equation?

462
01:11:03,326 --> 01:11:06,899
To be a buxom, overblown mother..

463
01:11:08,598 --> 01:11:09,872
Lording it over servants...

464
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:11,775
gossiping in clubs...

465
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:14,206
just another rich matron

466
01:11:15,238 --> 01:11:17,650
If that's what you predict,
I'll become one, okay?

467
01:11:19,308 --> 01:11:24,348
And your merchant master?
Where is the matron?

468
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:18,611
Shilpa, aren't you afraid?

469
01:12:20,903 --> 01:12:23,315
Afraid? Of what?

470
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:25,378
Of being alone?

471
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:29,214
<i>There's Sun“...</i>

472
01:12:29,912 --> 01:12:31,016
the children...

473
01:12:32,315 --> 01:12:33,419
the servants...

474
01:12:35,151 --> 01:12:36,721
and neighbours around.

475
01:12:37,653 --> 01:12:38,757
Don't forget the dog.

476
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:43,196
Yes, he's there too.

477
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:46,306
And yet you aren't afraid? Of yourself

478
01:12:49,265 --> 01:12:50,335
Why should I be?

479
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:54,006
What happens at night...

480
01:12:56,372 --> 01:13:02,050
When a peculiar loneliness
haunts you, takes hold of you...

481
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:09,088
What kind of loneliness?

482
01:13:11,153 --> 01:13:12,598
Sunil's around...

483
01:13:14,290 --> 01:13:15,360
Sometimes.

484
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:26,675
Come, let's go in.

485
01:14:05,174 --> 01:14:09,418
Why are you silent?
- No, reason, really.

486
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:17,060
Are you afraid of yourself?

487
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:24,736
Shilpa, I guess I'll leave.

488
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:28,426
Going out, somewhere
- Yes...!

489
01:15:29,024 --> 01:15:33,336
You can spare a few
minutes though, can't you?

490
01:15:37,833 --> 01:15:38,903
Sit!

491
01:15:45,808 --> 01:15:48,948
We share the same home,
yet hardly meet.

492
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:52,857
It just struck me this morning...

493
01:15:53,415 --> 01:15:55,326
as to what a strange
life we're leading.

494
01:15:55,985 --> 01:15:58,431
It seems the age of
paying guests has arrived.

495
01:15:59,188 --> 01:16:01,168
You agree, don't you?

496
01:16:01,657 --> 01:16:05,298
If you don't, say so. We're friends.

497
01:16:08,030 --> 01:16:10,442
How are things at the shop?
- 0.K.

498
01:16:12,902 --> 01:16:15,348
You don't spend much
time there, perhaps.

499
01:16:15,938 --> 01:16:20,011
Mind you, a man must
have his diversions...

500
01:16:20,075 --> 01:16:21,452
I fully subscribe to this view...

501
01:16:24,113 --> 01:16:26,286
You can't spend 24 hours on the job...

502
01:16:26,348 --> 01:16:29,386
But if you own a
business you must look after it.

503
01:16:31,954 --> 01:16:38,166
If a granary is not cared for,
rats will get at it.

504
01:16:40,362 --> 01:16:42,774
This is what is
happening in the shop...

505
01:16:43,799 --> 01:16:46,177
Mahesh and Gopal are
nibbling away at the business.

506
01:16:46,235 --> 01:16:47,407
Impossible!
- No, it's true!

507
01:16:48,404 --> 01:16:50,077
A friend of mine visited the shop...

508
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:53,916
Mahesh offered to sell
him his own stuff...

509
01:16:53,976 --> 01:16:56,684
at 25 percent less than our own rates

510
01:16:57,413 --> 01:17:00,257
My friend reported this
to me. He was shocked!

511
01:17:02,184 --> 01:17:05,757
I checked the books and found...

512
01:17:06,188 --> 01:17:08,964
...they've been
cheating us for months.

513
01:17:11,694 --> 01:17:13,935
Now, what do we do?

514
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:16,136
Sack Mahesh!

515
01:17:17,766 --> 01:17:21,976
What will our relatives say?
Mahesh is your cousin.

516
01:17:22,238 --> 01:17:25,742
So what? Did you
employ him to cheat us?

517
01:17:27,005 --> 01:17:28,570
I will go see to it

518
01:17:28,542 --> 01:17:31,943
I don't think it will be
wise to kick out Mahesh

519
01:17:32,348 --> 01:17:35,921
If he goes, several
customers go with him

520
01:17:37,853 --> 01:17:39,093
What else can we do?

521
01:17:40,289 --> 01:17:43,065
You decide. You're the manager.

522
01:17:45,327 --> 01:17:47,466
But it should be settled by tomorrow.

523
01:17:47,963 --> 01:17:49,442
Everything is upto you.

524
01:18:09,886 --> 01:18:12,471
I think we should get
him married now.

525
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:44,959
That's right, isn't it?
- Yes sir

526
01:18:48,090 --> 01:18:51,936
We placed our trust in you
and these are the returns?

527
01:18:55,898 --> 01:18:57,809
If we wanted, we could jail you...

528
01:19:00,102 --> 01:19:02,082
Or print this scandal in the papers.

529
01:19:03,639 --> 01:19:09,418
You're lucky, we've only sacked you

530
01:19:11,313 --> 01:19:14,157
Sir, but Mahesh...
- Don't confuse things!

531
01:19:15,351 --> 01:19:16,830
Have you cheated, or not?

532
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:20,891
But sir, Mahesh...
- Keep Mahesh out of it!

533
01:19:24,132 --> 01:19:26,717
Collect your notice,
pay and get out

534
01:20:39,401 --> 01:20:40,778
Where are we going?

535
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:52,916
Why did you sack Gopal?

536
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:57,956
He deserved to be. Bloody thief!

537
01:20:58,887 --> 01:21:01,959
It wasn't his fault...
he only did what Mahesh...

538
01:21:03,358 --> 01:21:04,860
You're very concerned about Gopal.

539
01:21:16,605 --> 01:21:20,109
If you don't want me around,
I'll leave...

540
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:26,559
Get out you bloody bitch.

541
01:21:32,688 --> 01:21:34,690
Do you believe that if you go...

542
01:21:34,756 --> 01:21:37,327
Arvind Desai will roam
the streets in despair?

543
01:21:38,961 --> 01:21:40,269
What do you think of yourself?

544
01:21:42,130 --> 01:21:45,839
Want to leave?
Leave then!

545
01:21:47,736 --> 01:21:49,306
What else are you capable of anyway?

546
01:21:51,974 --> 01:21:54,181
Threatening to leave, at
the smallest excuse...

547
01:21:56,378 --> 01:21:57,857
All you women are the same.

548
01:22:02,251 --> 01:22:04,094
Apart from slyly getting your way...

549
01:22:06,688 --> 01:22:09,692
making fools of others
pretending to suffer in silence...

550
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:10,862
what else can you do?

551
01:22:16,031 --> 01:22:18,341
You...Shilpa...my mother...

552
01:22:20,235 --> 01:22:21,373
...you're all alike.

553
01:24:22,943 --> 01:24:25,596
Come, I will show you one more thing

554
01:24:32,862 --> 01:24:35,175
Have you met all
these people yet?

555
01:24:36,873 --> 01:24:38,982
C'mon, I will introduce you...

556
01:24:40,623 --> 01:24:42,185
This is Mrs. Vaswani...

557
01:24:45,441 --> 01:24:46,393
Akelachand...

558
01:24:46,665 --> 01:24:47,685
Saeed Mirza...

559
01:24:49,295 --> 01:24:52,764
She is Maya...
She has just come back from Paris.

560
01:24:54,425 --> 01:24:55,718
Yes... Sorbonne...

561
01:24:59,138 --> 01:25:01,111
Excuse me...
Maya please...

562
01:25:02,915 --> 01:25:05,622
Come,
they are a boring lot na?

563
01:25:06,430 --> 01:25:08,695
This is my husband Sunil...

564
01:25:58,949 --> 01:26:02,350
I want to talk to you about
something important...

565
01:26:04,236 --> 01:26:07,297
Do you mind if I snatch
her away for a while.

566
01:26:08,116 --> 01:26:09,681
Come...
-Go, its okay.

567
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:07,732
Don't worry...don't worry...
he'll let you become...

568
01:27:07,789 --> 01:27:10,998
his old faithful servant.
You'll oblige, won't you?

569
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:13,096
Don't worry, mama. Your daughter
will have a home at least.

570
01:27:13,448 --> 01:27:14,741


571
01:27:14,987 --> 01:27:16,416
Just wait everybody.

572
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:21,949
Mother, I am going to
become a mother...

573
01:27:21,689 --> 01:27:23,866
What have you done daughter,

574
01:27:23,361 --> 01:27:25,688
you have ruined this
family's reputa-

575
01:27:25,741 --> 01:27:26,829
You are leaving?

576
01:27:26,726 --> 01:27:28,460
What have you done daughter,

577
01:27:28,696 --> 01:27:30,884
you have ruined this
family's reputation.

578
01:27:31,330 --> 01:27:33,562
What say?
The dialogue fits in, na?

579
01:27:33,596 --> 01:27:35,255
Absolutely perfect sync.

580
01:27:35,225 --> 01:27:36,858
Okay, I will get going,

581
01:27:36,886 --> 01:27:38,345
you finish all your
crying and stuff,

582
01:27:38,435 --> 01:27:39,960
then neXt scene...

583
01:27:42,277 --> 01:27:45,270
May my life go away,
but not my promise...

584
01:28:16,235 --> 01:28:18,396
Oh, Mr. Roberts
come in, come in..

585
01:28:18,553 --> 01:28:20,480
How are you sir?
- Fine

586
01:28:20,923 --> 01:28:22,964
Hello Malhotra Saheb.
-Hello

587
01:28:23,058 --> 01:28:24,691
Please sit down.
-Sure.

588
01:28:27,380 --> 01:28:29,958
Well, Mr. Roberts
what have you decided?

589
01:28:30,141 --> 01:28:31,956
Mr. Roberts likes the carpets

590
01:28:32,198 --> 01:28:34,425
That's great.

591
01:28:34,464 --> 01:28:36,675
I don't like your prices,
Mr. Desai

592
01:28:36,684 --> 01:28:39,523
Roberts sir is right -
the prices are high!

593
01:28:39,484 --> 01:28:40,993
They need to be lowered

594
01:28:41,007 --> 01:28:43,008
You see, we don't
deal in small stuff

595
01:28:42,984 --> 01:28:44,024
we buy in bulk!

596
01:28:44,046 --> 01:28:45,611
That's absolutely right!

597
01:28:45,655 --> 01:28:48,171
In bulk, the prices
should be lower

598
01:28:49,531 --> 01:28:50,858
You can say this because

599
01:28:51,186 --> 01:28:54,967
you are probably not
aware of our business

600
01:28:55,015 --> 01:28:57,736
The craftsmen are
demanding higher wages

601
01:28:57,828 --> 01:29:00,128
and then there are
brokers in between

602
01:29:02,726 --> 01:29:05,733
My prices are
governed by my market

603
01:29:05,923 --> 01:29:08,018
and not your problems

604
01:29:08,136 --> 01:29:11,265
But surely you could
eXplain to your retailers

605
01:29:10,793 --> 01:29:12,766
You don't know them
but I do

606
01:29:12,843 --> 01:29:14,612
You gotta make a decision

607
01:29:18,809 --> 01:29:20,782
I'll let you know Mr. Roberts

608
01:29:20,712 --> 01:29:23,320
Can you give me some time?
A day or two perhaps

609
01:29:23,535 --> 01:29:24,691
Sorry, I can't...

610
01:29:25,059 --> 01:29:27,916
In my country, the
fashion is in right now

611
01:29:29,199 --> 01:29:30,976
So, I gotta know from you

612
01:29:31,699 --> 01:29:34,080
NOW!
not tomorrow or in a few days

613
01:29:34,629 --> 01:29:37,304
What's it going to be?
Yes, no...

614
01:29:39,082 --> 01:29:41,465
Yes
C'mon, say yes..

615
01:29:42,656 --> 01:29:44,570
C'mon Mr. Desai

616
01:29:45,410 --> 01:29:46,634
It's a deal, okay?

617
01:29:47,717 --> 01:29:50,030
We will finalise the deal tomorrow

618
01:29:50,276 --> 01:29:51,569
Thank you very much

619
01:29:51,682 --> 01:29:52,561
So long...

620
01:30:33,142 --> 01:30:34,094
Have a seat..

621
01:30:34,100 --> 01:30:35,733
Fatima has a customer...

622
01:32:41,645 --> 01:32:44,706
Can you drop us at
Chruchgate station please

623
01:32:44,775 --> 01:32:46,816
Thanks a lot
-You are welcome

624
01:32:53,969 --> 01:32:55,806
We have been rescued na.. .

625
01:32:57,400 --> 01:32:58,957
Where are you coming from?

626
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:01,113
A film...
Quite a bad one...

627
01:33:01,145 --> 01:33:02,438
Which one was it?

628
01:33:02,455 --> 01:33:04,428
An old one...
Roman Holiday.

629
01:33:05,502 --> 01:33:07,339
They have released it again

630
01:33:07,352 --> 01:33:08,917
Not a bad film actually

631
01:33:08,673 --> 01:33:09,829
You have seen it?

632
01:33:09,824 --> 01:33:11,408
Yeah, a few years earlier.

633
01:33:11,442 --> 01:33:13,891
By the way I am Manoj
She is Rashmi

634
01:33:14,470 --> 01:33:15,490
What do you do?

635
01:33:15,549 --> 01:33:16,773
 He sells flowers.

636
01:33:16,815 --> 01:33:17,346
Flowers?

637
01:33:17,423 --> 01:33:19,923
Oh yes,
We have a flower store in Bandra

638
01:33:19,940 --> 01:33:21,971
By his, he means his father's.

639
01:33:22,034 --> 01:33:24,064
Manoj is an eXpert in Ichibana

640
01:33:24,142 --> 01:33:25,714
You know the japenese..

641
01:33:25,727 --> 01:33:27,826
He would already know about it.

642
01:33:27,814 --> 01:33:29,057
Actually I have just heard the name

643
01:33:29,104 --> 01:33:31,417
Don't know anything else about it.
-Nothing else, really?

644
01:33:38,479 --> 01:33:39,635
What did you say?

645
01:33:39,667 --> 01:33:42,338
She is saying that maybe
you aren't married

646
01:33:42,332 --> 01:33:43,494
How did you know?

647
01:33:43,557 --> 01:33:45,619
  Because you don't know Ichibana...

648
01:33:46,057 --> 01:33:49,458
Please don't mind her...
she is like this only...

649
01:33:49,635 --> 01:33:51,540
By the way,
what do you do?

650
01:33:51,885 --> 01:33:53,041
me?

651
01:33:56,791 --> 01:33:58,220
Let us see what I do.

652
01:33:59,198 --> 01:34:01,103
We have a firm in Lonavala.

653
01:34:01,323 --> 01:34:01,963
firm?

654
01:34:03,573 --> 01:34:04,525
Yes, a firm...

655
01:34:04,745 --> 01:34:06,010
It's quite big.

656
01:34:06,104 --> 01:34:08,145
My home is part of that only.

657
01:34:09,245 --> 01:34:11,898
Today I had come down to town to visit.
Weekends...

658
01:34:12,761 --> 01:34:15,346
One needs a little bit of town too na.

659
01:34:16,870 --> 01:34:17,550
Films...

660
01:34:18,229 --> 01:34:19,816
Friends...

661
01:34:21,104 --> 01:34:22,760
A small party...

662
01:34:24,761 --> 01:34:26,977
A little alcohol

663
01:34:29,322 --> 01:34:30,910
And then back home.

664
01:34:34,821 --> 01:34:36,250
What a lovely life...

665
01:34:39,196 --> 01:34:41,441
But nothing like your flower shop

666
01:34:47,821 --> 01:34:50,107
The station is here...

667
01:34:53,486 --> 01:34:54,983
Thank you very much...

668
01:34:55,048 --> 01:34:56,953
You didn't tell us your name.

669
01:34:57,720 --> 01:34:59,235
er... Ramesh, Ramesh SaXena

670
01:34:59,220 --> 01:35:01,501
 Thank you very much Mr. SaXena.
Good night.

671
01:36:23,689 --> 01:36:25,458
Oh! Arvind...
Come in...

672
01:36:30,486 --> 01:36:34,227
 Good that you dropped by.
I have lots to tell you...

673
01:36:37,595 --> 01:36:38,547
Have a seat...

674
01:36:42,517 --> 01:36:44,459
First things first.

675
01:36:45,527 --> 01:36:46,411
What is this?

676
01:36:46,659 --> 01:36:49,642
Regional Charity trust tickets...
For the orphans.

677
01:36:51,278 --> 01:36:52,571
When did you start?

678
01:36:53,496 --> 01:36:55,129
After talking to you...

679
01:36:55,606 --> 01:36:57,714
Felt like I am getting useless.

680
01:36:57,711 --> 01:37:00,160
That's why I am doing Social Service

681
01:37:00,245 --> 01:37:01,946
I go to the blind school

682
01:37:02,747 --> 01:37:04,720
I work on improving the slums

683
01:37:05,697 --> 01:37:07,874
Have stopped clubbing and all...

684
01:37:08,163 --> 01:37:11,224
Second's thing second...
Would you have tea?

685
01:37:15,632 --> 01:37:16,132
Yeah...

686
01:37:19,902 --> 01:37:21,331
I must make it myself

687
01:37:21,471 --> 01:37:23,036
Am becoming obese na...

688
01:37:23,767 --> 01:37:26,284
Have started playing badminton too...

689
01:38:47,435 --> 01:38:48,728
This area is mine.

690
01:38:49,195 --> 01:38:51,916
No-bloody-one will come save you here...

691
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:55,413
Where is sir's car today, eh?

692
01:38:56,138 --> 01:38:58,247
Some one looted your store kya?

693
01:38:58,950 --> 01:39:03,168
If I don't loot it,
it will be looted by your cousin - Mahesh

694
01:39:03,612 --> 01:39:04,836
Say something now.

695
01:39:05,591 --> 01:39:08,584
Without the position,
now you are a weasel?

696
01:39:09,836 --> 01:39:13,741
Hey, rich kid,
learn to work with your hand

697
01:39:14,159 --> 01:39:17,152
One tight slap
and you will be flat here...

698
01:39:17,195 --> 01:39:19,508
Where do you think you are going?

699
01:39:19,839 --> 01:39:22,764
Is it disrespectful to stand on the street?

700
01:39:23,016 --> 01:39:25,125
We don't have any respect only?

701
01:39:27,625 --> 01:39:29,530
GO!
forgave you this time..

702
01:40:18,497 --> 01:40:19,940
Seems like you were waiting for me

703
01:40:21,849 --> 01:40:24,756
Do you want to talk about
something specific?

704
01:40:25,123 --> 01:40:25,735
Maybe...

705
01:40:27,350 --> 01:40:29,051
I wish I had known myself

706
01:40:52,925 --> 01:40:54,830
Rajan, how do you manage it?

707
01:40:55,074 --> 01:40:56,230
What do you mean?

708
01:40:56,871 --> 01:40:58,232
I mean, your life...

709
01:41:00,172 --> 01:41:01,873
everything seems right

710
01:41:02,154 --> 01:41:03,991
seems like well settled, adjusted

711
01:41:08,348 --> 01:41:09,368
But it's not...

712
01:41:16,668 --> 01:41:18,777
Do you want to know my problem?

713
01:41:21,963 --> 01:41:23,392
To live in a world...

714
01:41:25,234 --> 01:41:29,180
where there is a huge gap
between my thoughts and action

715
01:41:30,098 --> 01:41:31,186
a world where...

716
01:41:32,422 --> 01:41:33,919
there are NO set rules

717
01:41:44,421 --> 01:41:45,850
maybe man can only...

718
01:41:47,634 --> 01:41:49,675
try to ask the right question.

719
01:41:56,994 --> 01:41:58,218
Looks smashing na?

720
01:42:00,529 --> 01:42:01,549
and the answer?

721
01:42:03,914 --> 01:42:05,002
What about them?

722
01:42:09,381 --> 01:42:10,061
Answers...

723
01:42:13,034 --> 01:42:15,483
The answers maybe are ahead of us...

724
01:42:18,263 --> 01:42:19,283
I don't know...

725
01:42:26,794 --> 01:42:29,107
Then we are in the
same situation.

726
01:42:29,137 --> 01:42:29,637
NO!

727
01:42:59,255 --> 01:43:01,568
Arvind hasn't come
since yesterday

728
01:43:02,946 --> 01:43:04,783
maybe won't come today also

729
01:43:07,712 --> 01:43:11,181
You only said that it was a phase,
it will pass...

730
01:43:14,223 --> 01:43:16,264
Have I interfered in his work?

731
01:43:18,379 --> 01:43:20,556
Gave him all the independence...

732
01:43:21,986 --> 01:43:24,299
He had a free choice in everything

733
01:43:26,352 --> 01:43:28,325
I treated him like a friend.

734
01:43:32,720 --> 01:43:34,557
What have I spoilt for him?

735
01:43:39,028 --> 01:43:40,593
I found a girl for him!

736
01:43:43,426 --> 01:43:45,059
and that too like him...

737
01:43:45,633 --> 01:43:46,449
sensitive...

738
01:43:47,108 --> 01:43:48,332
highly educated...

739
01:43:49,334 --> 01:43:50,763
from a good family...

740
01:43:52,157 --> 01:43:54,130
what have I not done for him?

741
01:43:55,359 --> 01:43:55,859
now...

742
01:43:56,873 --> 01:43:58,302
Where are you going?

743
01:43:59,842 --> 01:44:01,135
I have some work...
