Have you finished all your duties?

Have you proffered all your
duties to the Lord?

48
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:03,977
Mrityu(death), listen to me.

49
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:17,692
The Supreme being is the One
who created this Universe

50
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:21,933
The temple epitomises the body

Holy Fire, the devourer of...

speech, sight and mind !

57
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:52,020
Meditate upon that truth...

58
00:09:52,525 --> 00:10:07,031
which creates, sustains and
dissolves this universe

59
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:16,512
Air, fire & water are immortal.

60
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,746
Only this body is mortal.

61
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:27,081
Oh fire! l will get enlightened
with your light.

62
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:32,128
May my breath mingle
with the immortal fire

63
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:38,092

with your brightness.

of Shankara into Brahmanism...

65
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:23,782
...and his ceremonial seeking
of alms from his mother

66
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:39,128
Son, come here

67
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,799
Son, l am departing.
- Where to, Father ?

68
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:57,605
Unto eternity.
- Why?

69
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:01,814
This body is mortal.
- Where is Eternity ?

70
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:09,116
Within one's own Self
- Then you are not really leaving ?

71
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:24,833
Son, death is a friend

72
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:29,843
When he arrives,
do not be afraid of him

73
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:51,870
Recite the verse l taught you

74
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:59,403
Like water that descends from
the skies and flows into seas...

75
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:07,045
...offerings to all Gods,
reach the Supreme Deity

76
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,688
Like water that descends from
the skies and flows into seas ...

77
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,223
Every living being finally
merges with the Supreme Being

78
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:26,894
As your father said,
look upon Death as a friend

79
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:29,407
l am Death and your dear friend
- Welcome. Abide with me

80
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:40,582
Still talking to your son!

81
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:55,066
What has happened?

82
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:25,463
Handing over grass-shoots
signifies transfer of authority...

83
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:29,959
to perform further rites

84
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:38,643
Funeral chants

85
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:14,805
Shankara receives initiation
into Brahmanism

86
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:19,878
This world rests on 'His' shoulders,

87
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:27,182
Past, present & future are totally
under 'His' control

88
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:34,396
Wisdom in the form of a boy
sits and observes

89
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:38,530
The beginning of learning the
nature of 'Self' and 'Universe'

90
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,089
Chanting of "Gayatri",
a holy mantra

91
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,315
Shankara recalls his Father's words

92
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:06,416
The body is mortal.
l go unto Eternity

93
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:50,760
Mother, this is my friend 'Wisdom'.
He has come to stay with me

94
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:55,871
Amidst so many children here,
he can be part of us too?

95
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,103
Stay comfortably, son

96
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,384
Shankara, have you
forgotten me ?

97
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,730
Not at all. Come along

98
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:55,666
The Upanishadic imagery of two
birds, the crow and the dove

99
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:06,500
The crow is the doer, the active one

100
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:19,087
The dove is the "Atman" (inner self),
the passive observer

101
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:45,612
The Sanskrit school located
in the Temple grounds

102
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:29,820
Why are you late today ?
Who are these boys ?

103
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:35,328
My friends, Wisdom and Death

104
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:38,792
Mother gave me permission.
l brought them here.

105
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:41,735
Alright, be seated

106
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:55,353
l am Wisdom, sir

107
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:58,822
l am Death, sir

108
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:05,091
Well, 'Death' and 'Wisdom'
have no physical forms

109
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:08,265
lf you are so named, so be it.
Be seated

110
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:20,709
The ignorant can only think
in terms of a mortal body

111
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:27,385
A poor man's home

112
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:31,522
l seek alms...

113
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:36,383
A verse from the scripture,
the Bhagawata, is heard

114
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:41,388
The wisdom of truth
is like the nectar ...

115
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:44,393
... of the fruit of
the Tree of Veda

116
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:52,005
People living on earth may
drink it for eternity

117
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:09,518
Mother, give me alms

118
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,430
Mother, give me alms

119
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:22,840
Wait, l am coming

120
00:22:37,489 --> 00:23:05,307
May the Goddess looking kindly on me
shower her blessings in plenty

121
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,788
Why do you weep ?

122
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:13,591
No son, no

123
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:17,491
You are like my Mother.
Please tell me the truth

124
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:20,090
My husband brings a mere handful

125
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:22,094
He believes, "Hoarding food is a sin"

126
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:27,327
l can't offer you anything,
so l'm sad

127
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:35,776
The one, having the inner vision,
truly understands the Universe

128
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:43,317
And He is the Lord of the past,
present and the future

129
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:20,925
As a tradition, 'initiated' boys
seek alms in various houses

130
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:36,062
Giving alms to young Brahmins
was considered a high honour

131
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,265
Take alms, O young Brahmin.
- No! Not from your house!

132
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:13,008
Why ? What's the reason ?

133
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:17,915
Your very neighbour believes,
'Hoarding even a morsel is a sin'

134
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:22,342
But here, you have hoarded sin!
Hence, l will not take alms

135
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,464
Listern, come here

136
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:15,668
Looking at this young
Brahman's sacrifice

137
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:19,910
Distribute this food supply to
the poor and needy

138
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:26,347
How am l to believe that the
self does not change?

139
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:29,881
Observe this boy.
When he moves, he cannot stand

140
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:37,692
When he stands, he cannot move.
ls that not so, my child ?

141
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:45,930
l am not aware of my body.
l am thinking of the lady we saw

142
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:51,437
Did you hear ? The boy is here,
his mind elsewhere!

143
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:55,971
Be it so, be it so.
We will meet later

144
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:05,913
Sir, how does a human being
attain equanimity ?

145
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,527
By becoming a Sanyasin (a monk)

146
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:14,061
Shankara decides to renounce
the world to become a monk

147
00:27:35,286 --> 00:27:38,255
Mother, l want to become a monk

148
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,758
See, the milk is dripping.
Wipe your mouth

149
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:56,168
Mother, l want to become a monk.
- Where is Wisdom ? Go play with him

150
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:06,784
Mother, l want to become a monk

151
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:09,486
You think it is a joke?
Don't mention it again

152
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:17,988
Shankara recalls the
words of his Teacher

153
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:23,490
Paths of action and of renunciation
are ways sanctioned by scripture

154
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:30,797
Very few, when young, have
renounced to become monks

155
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:40,479
One such, in the great heritage
is the revered teacher, Govinda

156
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:45,412
Such men are rare

157
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:04,327
Who are you ?
When did you begin to steal ?

158
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:06,598
Stay where you are.
l shall punish you

159
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:43,599
What is this punishment ?
He can't touch the cloth,

160
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:47,274
nor can he jump over it

161
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:50,941
Shall l untie it ?

162
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:28,485
Come down

163
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:49,004
Vow that you will never
steal again

164
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:53,006
l promise

165
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:57,014
Eat. lt is for you

166
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:09,526
These, too, are for you

167
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:31,842
Call this a punishment ?

168
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:35,480
Physical punishment is never
a lasting one

169
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,450
The psychic one endures

170
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:42,059
Henceforth he will not steal.
- How can you trust him ?

171
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:47,057
"Trust in Self" is the
path of the scriptures...

172
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:53,199
A noble secret, a great tradition

173
00:32:56,107 --> 00:33:00,635
Alas, a tradition we are fast losing

174
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:36,235
Shankara, get up. lt is late

175
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:20,148
Death, why are you here ?
- Waiting for you !

176
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,957
Where is Wisdom ?
- Meditating, there

177
00:34:58,029 --> 00:35:00,793
Shankara is drawn to the saffron robe

178
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:03,598
Saffron denotes renunciation

179
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:51,838
Shankara, don't swim too far.
There are whirlpools, crocodiles!

180
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:25,275
Shankara wants to be a monk

181
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:30,277
Let him become one,
but let him live long

182
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:19,135
Shankar, mother is coming

183
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,873
Mother

184
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:39,112
Mother wished to see you alive,
even letting you become a monk

185
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:43,349
You, indeed are a monk now

186
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:44,889
Really

187
00:37:45,796 --> 00:37:48,629
l saved him from the jaws
of the crocodile

188
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:52,391
You possess all the virtues.
May fortune smile on you

189
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:40,150
l will get you milk

190
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:05,909
Drummer proclaiming

191
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:31,259
"The play "Nachiketha" will be
performed in the Krishna Temple"

192
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,494
A ballet in the style of Kerala State

193
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:10,504
Nachiketha waits for three days
in the house of the Lord of Death

194
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:14,845
The Lord of Death returns

195
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:18,804
Making a respected guest wait
bodes ill for the host

196
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:25,550
Yama apologises

197
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:31,551
l made you wait for three days

198
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:41,827
ln return l grant you 3 boons.
Ask for them

199
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:50,278
'May my father shed his anger
against me and welcome me back'

200
00:40:51,348 --> 00:40:52,872
Granted

201
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:59,584
Reveal the secrets
of the holy fire to me

202
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:02,081
Granted

203
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:10,294
ls there life after death ?
Learned men debate and disagree

204
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:14,598
This is an age-old question
and repeatedly asked

205
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:18,642
This is the third and most
important boon l seek

206
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:22,874
But please don't ask this question

207
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:25,248
Ask some other boon

208
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:31,883
No boon is equalent to it

209
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:42,631
Dear boy, l shall give you wealth,
grant you long life and happiness

210
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:57,613
l want neither wealth nor pleasures

211
00:41:58,382 --> 00:42:00,873
l wish to know the secret of life

212
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:10,621
lt can't be learnt through
dialectics and logic

213
00:42:12,129 --> 00:42:15,098
But only through individual
experience

214
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:23,368
You have the right aptitude.
My blessings to you

215
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:41,658
Neither the play nor the message
made any sense

216
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:49,661
ln truth, there was neither
Nachiketha nor Yama (Death)

217
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:52,665
What matters is Nachiketha's
firmness in seeking the truth

218
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:54,938
A noble example to be emulated

219
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:05,671
l am leaving to seek
Govindapada. Look after Mother

220
00:43:07,451 --> 00:43:13,185
Should you not inform her ?
- l go with her blessings

221
00:43:17,061 --> 00:43:20,690
Who will perform my funeral rites ?
lt is the sacred duty of a son

222
00:43:21,131 --> 00:43:23,361
Mother, l will return to
perform the rites

223
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:35,501
Every drop of water from
the sky reaches the sea

224
00:44:36,373 --> 00:44:38,773
The Kerala-Karnataka border,
South lndia

225
00:45:10,574 --> 00:45:13,543
He must be a sinner.
Our Tree-God punished him

226
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:16,077
Let us bury him under stones

227
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:41,167
The blind belief of the tribes
pains Shankara

228
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:44,336
Shankara sees social injustice.
He views the cosmos in its entirety

229
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:52,638
"Tell me, who are you ?
You, so fierce in form,"

230
00:45:54,284 --> 00:45:57,185
"O supreme power,
who ever you are"

231
00:45:58,956 --> 00:46:00,856
"l bow before you"

232
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:05,061
"l know not your purpose"

233
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:10,862
"l wish to know you, O Primal One.

234
00:46:22,246 --> 00:46:28,879
"Amidst distractions from
other heterodox faiths..."

235
00:46:32,923 --> 00:46:36,222
Shankara continues his journey,
seeking Govindapada

236
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:52,903
"For the one in quest of knowledge
Vedas will be the shelter..."

237
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:56,312
"as the ocean is the shelter
for all rivers"

238
00:47:06,957 --> 00:47:10,916
Karnataka border,
Southern lndia

239
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:48,144
Gokarna, North Karnataka
Southern lndia

240
00:50:52,315 --> 00:50:55,751
Vishnu, an old friend,
calls out to Shankara

241
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,538
l became a monk
with Mother's consent

242
00:51:23,213 --> 00:51:25,773
Are you going to perform
austere penance ?

243
00:51:26,216 --> 00:51:34,180
"Duty is its own reward",
is the Lord's saying in Gita

244
00:51:37,227 --> 00:51:39,457
May l follow you ?

245
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:43,199
lf we are together
we will succeed

246
00:52:04,254 --> 00:52:07,553
State of Madhya Pradesh,
Central lndia

247
00:52:17,267 --> 00:52:22,899
These symbols of imperfection
aspiring for perfection

248
00:52:27,277 --> 00:52:31,577
Are you still awake,
shivering with cold ?

249
00:53:19,095 --> 00:53:21,063
Omkareswar, Central lndia

250
00:53:22,065 --> 00:53:25,296
"Sun, the primal force, guiding
the destiny of every being...

251
00:53:25,669 --> 00:53:30,629
governs the earth and heaven"

252
00:53:35,345 --> 00:53:38,314
Hindu tradition dictates that one is
first a disciple, then a householder

253
00:53:38,748 --> 00:53:43,651
Then comes the practice of austerity,
leading finally to renunciation

254
00:53:44,955 --> 00:53:49,415
True. But one can also renounce
soon after initiation

255
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,928
l prefer this approach

256
00:54:06,376 --> 00:54:11,336
This is the holy river, Narmada
Govindapada's hermitage must be near

257
00:54:35,405 --> 00:54:37,703
The River Narmada turns violent

258
00:54:55,425 --> 00:55:00,385
You are the primal force.
Supreme and oldest among all

259
00:55:02,232 --> 00:55:04,598
The root cause of the Universe

260
00:55:06,236 --> 00:55:09,535
You are the Knower,
And the Known, too.

261
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:16,110
Pervader of all and the eternal.
The greatest refuge for all

262
00:55:52,282 --> 00:55:56,810
Victory to the boy who quelled
the turbulence of Narmada !

263
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:07,589
Come and see here is that boy
Come quickly, Come...

264
00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:14,666
Victory to the boy who quelled
the turbulence of Narmada !

265
00:56:14,904 --> 00:56:16,872
Where do you wish to go?

266
00:56:17,307 --> 00:56:20,276
l have come seeking the
reversed teacher, Govindapada

267
00:56:21,077 --> 00:56:22,806
Welcome, welcome

268
00:56:41,531 --> 00:56:52,305
"To him, the erudite scholar,
the knower of all the scriptures..."

269
00:56:53,209 --> 00:56:59,045
"To the revered teacher Govinda,
my humble salutation"

270
00:57:06,356 --> 00:57:09,519
My child, what brings you here?
- l am Shankara, son of Shivaguru, ...

271
00:57:10,126 --> 00:57:13,789
a brahmin from the South

272
00:57:15,398 --> 00:57:21,530
l come to you seeking refuge,
to resolve the enigma of existence

273
00:57:27,577 --> 00:57:33,538
With this mortal body, how can
you cross the ocean of existence?

274
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:37,950
"Body" is subject to birth and
death; but not "Atman"(the Self)

275
00:57:38,588 --> 00:57:43,890
"The unreal has no existence;
the real never ceases to be"

276
00:57:44,594 --> 00:57:46,562
Come here, my child

277
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:02,908
You will be an ascetic
of the highest order

278
00:58:03,613 --> 00:58:06,582
A chant in praise of the Atman
(the inner Self)

279
00:58:11,721 --> 00:58:13,621
"Atman is beneath in the nadir,
above in the zenith"

280
00:58:15,859 --> 00:58:17,520
Atman is all-pervading

281
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:25,832
Realisation of this Truth
leads to emancipation

282
00:59:19,422 --> 00:59:22,220
Choose a script which you like

283
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:37,671
All your wishes will be fulfilled

284
00:59:57,594 --> 01:00:01,360
These are the aphorisms of
the sage, Badarayana

285
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:13,038
Sir, these are all torn

286
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:22,545
True. No one cares for them.
l tried to preserve them but failed

287
01:00:23,152 --> 01:00:33,050
A noble secret. A great tradition.
Alas, a tradition fast decaying

288
01:00:33,763 --> 01:00:39,065
Sir, may l restore and edit them ?
- l would be happy indeed

289
01:00:40,103 --> 01:00:46,133
Perhaps it is the desire of our
great sages that you do so

290
01:00:47,543 --> 01:00:52,742
<i>Comment on these texts and spread
their wisdom among the people</i>

291
01:00:53,383 --> 01:00:59,481
You will have my help
whenever you need it

292
01:01:58,181 --> 01:02:03,483
Look! Sage Shankara has given
a new form to Vedic dialectics

293
01:02:03,853 --> 01:02:05,821
What erudition!

294
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:09,089
lndeed, a remarkable work

295
01:02:09,459 --> 01:02:12,758
"Everything is Brahman"
(the Universal Self)?

296
01:02:12,962 --> 01:02:17,661
But, how can we accept that...

297
01:03:21,531 --> 01:03:37,744
Come, all of you

298
01:03:39,048 --> 01:03:42,916
"Everything is Brahman"
How can we accept this?

299
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,315
Let us ask him straight

300
01:04:43,913 --> 01:04:47,178
"Earth" is the unchangeable truth

301
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:17,743
Come, come quickly

302
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:27,683
lt is not my opinion.
The ancient Seers said so

303
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:36,487
Listen to the story of Satyakama.
He asked his mother, Jabala

304
01:05:37,133 --> 01:05:48,806
l wish to be initiated into Brahminhood.
Tell me my lineage

305
01:06:35,458 --> 01:06:39,087
Mother! What is my lineage?

306
01:06:47,703 --> 01:06:51,104
l wish to be initiated
into Brahminhood

307
01:06:52,141 --> 01:06:54,769
Please tell me my lineage

308
01:07:13,162 --> 01:07:28,942
My youth was spent
serving many a house

309
01:07:32,181 --> 01:07:35,548
My son, l don't know your lineage

310
01:07:36,952 --> 01:07:42,049
All l know is...
that l am Jabala.

311
01:07:43,459 --> 01:07:46,485
And you are my son Satyakama

312
01:07:57,940 --> 01:08:01,000
Revered sir,
l know not my lineage

313
01:08:01,143 --> 01:08:05,876
When l asked my mother, she said
she doesn't know about my lineage

314
01:08:07,216 --> 01:08:10,674
All l know is that l am
Satyakama, son of Jabala

315
01:08:11,053 --> 01:08:13,749
So, l am Sathyakam Jabala

316
01:08:25,367 --> 01:08:30,100
None but a learned person can
be so forthright

317
01:08:30,873 --> 01:08:39,474
l shall initiate you to
Brahminhood

318
01:08:40,382 --> 01:08:46,116
The only wealth of the
knowledgeable is unity...

319
01:08:46,655 --> 01:08:50,113
equality and honesty

320
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:56,026
For the wise, true devotion
is ideal for a sanctified life

321
01:08:57,266 --> 01:09:00,235
Please, pardon us

322
01:09:03,706 --> 01:09:05,230
Banares, the holy city

323
01:09:05,541 --> 01:09:07,771
Letters combine to form words.
The "letter" is imperishable.

324
01:09:08,544 --> 01:09:18,886
Grammar is essential
to understand the meaning of words

325
01:09:20,923 --> 01:09:25,656
Hear the sound of a vessel falling.

326
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:32,666
This noise Dum is the root
of the word Du Krn Karane

327
01:09:34,436 --> 01:09:35,903
Did you ever hear it?

328
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:03,692
How fortunate l am

329
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:17,805
Lord, bless me towards ascetism.
Accept me as Your disciple

330
01:10:21,483 --> 01:10:23,815
So be it

331
01:10:32,595 --> 01:10:34,825
You will be called Padmapada

332
01:10:39,602 --> 01:10:43,561
Salutations

333
01:10:47,009 --> 01:10:48,567
Truly, a very learned man

334
01:10:48,944 --> 01:10:51,913
lndeed! Even our teacher has
great respect for him

335
01:10:52,615 --> 01:10:56,574
At Govindapada's hermitage
all have high praise for you

336
01:11:10,065 --> 01:11:14,593
A verse in praise of Shankara.
"l fall at your holy feet"

337
01:11:21,043 --> 01:11:26,606
"l seek refuge in you
revered Shankara"

338
01:11:30,386 --> 01:11:38,225
"You are the ocean of knowledge,
the embodiment of wisdom"

339
01:11:39,161 --> 01:11:43,120
l am quoting what has been
explained in the Upanishads

340
01:11:45,401 --> 01:11:50,236
l submit myself to you

341
01:11:52,408 --> 01:11:59,143
Revered Teacher, take me under your wings

342
01:12:02,117 --> 01:12:06,645
"l submit myself to you
kindly bless me, O graceful Shankara"

343
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:10,659
Such fine verse, from the
mouth of an illiterate

344
01:12:11,093 --> 01:12:13,653
A sweet verse, in Thotaka metre

345
01:12:15,798 --> 01:12:18,767
Due, of course, to Your blessings

346
01:12:22,371 --> 01:12:24,669
Henceforth you are named Thotaka

347
01:12:25,708 --> 01:12:29,474
When the heart is pure,
everything else is pure

348
01:12:30,079 --> 01:12:34,175
What's the use of good grammar,
without a good heart?

349
01:12:35,784 --> 01:12:46,422
When death strikes,
grammar doesn't save us

350
01:12:49,965 --> 01:12:52,695
"When limbs are weak and..."

351
01:12:55,738 --> 01:12:57,706
"hair become grey..."

352
01:12:59,742 --> 01:13:02,302
"Doddering, old &
toothless too..."

353
01:13:03,746 --> 01:13:06,715
"the decrepit moves with
the help of a walking-stick"

354
01:13:08,751 --> 01:13:12,118
"Man never gives up desires"

355
01:13:15,557 --> 01:13:16,387
That's why...

356
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:24,724
"Worship the Lord !
Worship the Lord !"

357
01:13:25,768 --> 01:13:30,728
"O fool! Worship the lord"

358
01:14:21,824 --> 01:14:33,497
"The King of Banaras coming
to see his holiness Shankara"

359
01:14:50,185 --> 01:14:53,814
Grace the court by your presence
