1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,833
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL

2
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:41,791
I hear you! Stop! Stop!

3
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:46,083
I can’t take your screams anymore!

4
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:12,791
Hey, little girl!

5
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:15,208
What are you doing here so late?

6
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:20,583
Aren't you Sanjay’s daughter?

7
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:23,791
Come, sit!

8
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:28,666
Sit, child.

9
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:31,458
Your father must be worried.

10
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,083
What are you doing here
so late at night?

11
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:58,958
Where is your house?

12
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:47,250
Who are you?

13
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,333
Why are you alone?

14
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:52,125
You’re drenched.

15
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:54,125
Come on. Come inside.

16
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,541
Your parents must be worried about you.

17
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,166
Tell me…

18
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,375
who is your father?

19
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:13,791
Let's get you home.

20
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,083
<i>Tadaagi!</i>

21
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,541
My <i>tadaagi</i>!

22
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:20,791
THE BLACK WELL

23
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:05,750
Shivangi!

24
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:07,375
What are you doing?

25
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,916
The last thing we need
is you falling down a well. What?

26
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,666
And look at yourself, so messy.

27
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,583
Let's go!

28
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:19,833
Who eats like this?

29
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:20,750
Rickshaw!

30
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:22,416
Rickshaw!

31
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,041
We won't get a rickshaw easily today.

32
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,708
-Mama.
-Just a minute, Shivangi.

33
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:29,916
Rickshaw!

34
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:35,125
Mama!

35
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:36,166
What is it?

36
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:40,250
I saw someone in that well.

37
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,166
Rickshaw!

38
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:47,166
Come.

39
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:59,375
You and your imagination...
One day it'll get us into trouble.

40
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:00,458
Let's go.

41
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,750
How was your math test?

42
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,750
Terrible.
Please don't tell Papa.

43
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,541
Don't worry. I won't say anything.

44
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:21,458
Concentrate on your studies next time.

45
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,416
Stop here.

46
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:28,250
Let's go, Shivangi

47
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,666
Here, take this.

48
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:36,958
Here!

49
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,750
Where were you, Darshan?

50
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,666
We waited forever in this heat.

51
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:46,000
You should have told me you weren't coming.
We were waiting for so long.

52
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:51,375
Shivangi, why are you making a mess?

53
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:04,500
Listen.

54
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:06,750
I haven’t told her anything yet.

55
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,375
I thought it would be best if you did,

56
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,958
Don't get into the details. She's a kid.

57
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:19,666
Fine, go pack.
Let's leave.

58
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,625
Pack?
What do you mean?

59
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:25,708
You're supposed to go alone.
Why are you involving me?

60
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,708
That's my mother.

61
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,416
Exactly… yours.

62
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:34,750
-Come Shivangi.
-Wait. Come here, child.

63
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,791
Where are we going, papa?

64
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:51,375
Child.

65
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:55,458
Your grandma…

66
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:59,166
-Died?
-Don't say such things.

67
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:00,750
She's sick.

68
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,333
Why haven't you packed yet?

69
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:14,750
There he goes again.

70
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,041
-Hurry, okay?
-Fine. I'll come.

71
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,250
But I won't listen to any of her nonsense.

72
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,500
My mother's sick Priya!

73
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,125
Mama.

74
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:03,625
Mama!

75
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,250
I need to pee.

76
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,250
Darshan, pull over.

77
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:19,583
Darshan, pull over on the side here.

78
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,250
Shivangi!

79
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:06,916
Let's go!

80
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,916
It's been so long since the three of us
have traveled together.

81
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:28,583
Idiot!

82
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,500
-Darshan, you've come.
-Auntie!

83
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,125
Is that Shivangi?

84
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:10,958
She has grown up.

85
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:15,666
It's been so long.

86
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:24,875
It was pouring.

87
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,666
It was late and thundering.

88
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:32,083
I don't know why…
I felt the need to come and check.

89
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:41,916
Shivangi, change into your pajamas.

90
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,916
No, let her stay!

91
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,666
Can you go and check if Twinkle is asleep?

92
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,250
Our buffalo.

93
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,875
She had such long hair,
you cut it so short.

94
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,333
But I guess she's a city girl.

95
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:21,458
She was lying on the floor when I came.

96
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,583
Thank God, she was breathing.

97
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I picked her up.

98
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,791
The doctor said
to take her to the hospital.

99
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:31,583
-But you know how she is.
-Yes, we all know how she is.

100
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,416
But you should've
taken her to the hospital.

101
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,958
You could have... if you'd been here.

102
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:41,541
She doesn't listen to me.

103
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,208
Auntie!

104
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,208
Auntie!

105
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:03,875
Auntie!

106
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,916
Auntie!

107
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,750
-Oh!
-Auntie!

108
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:14,375
Chandni, quiet!
They arrived very late last night.

109
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:15,958
Is Shivangi here?

110
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,625
Yes, but you're going to wake her up
with your yelling.

111
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:20,166
Go!

112
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:24,250
I’m awake.

113
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:28,250
Shivangi, this is Chandni.

114
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,666
You two used to play together.
Remember?

115
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:33,208
Go play.

116
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,333
Do you remember me?

117
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,250
Kind of..

118
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:41,625
Not much, but I've seen your photos.

119
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:45,041
Come in, I need to change first.

120
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,083
Come on, no one cares.

121
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:59,750
You know, only Auntie calls me Chandni.

122
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,541
Everyone else calls me Baby.

123
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,958
I'll show you around the village.

124
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,750
This is one of my favorite places.

125
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,666
Come, let's go up.

126
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:41,750
Can you open it?

127
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,666
Why don't you stay at Auntie's place?

128
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,000
But you can come to my
grandma's house too.

129
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,541
So are you gonna stay at that house?

130
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:54,083
Yes.

131
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,166
Why?

132
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:57,875
It's a strange house.

133
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:00,750
Strange? 

134
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,333
Why?
That's my grandma's house.

135
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:05,958
Yes.

136
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,041
Looks like it's going to rain.
We should leave.

137
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,583
Come let's go to Grandma's house.

138
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:33,208
No, you come to my house.
Come!

139
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,291
Do you like ghost stories? 

140
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,041
Come, I'll tell you one.

141
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:13,041
-Where is everyone?
-What do you mean?

142
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:16,541
I mean your mom and dad?

143
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:19,583
It's only me and Auntie here. 

144
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,916
Liar. You really don't remember anything,
do you?

145
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:43,416
Don't tell Auntie, okay?

146
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,083
What are these?

147
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:52,958
These are just names.

148
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,458
Here's the story.

149
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:10,041
Today, another girl in the village
saw a spirit.

150
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:13,458
A wandering spirit.

151
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:15,416
Spirit?

152
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,875
Don't interrupt!
The whole village was cursed.

153
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,166
Everyday there was a death.

154
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:25,916
Some had died.

155
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:28,250
And some were waiting to die.

156
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,083
Come let's play.

157
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:49,875
Why is your face covered?

158
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:56,083
The whole village is getting sick.

159
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:00,041
Don't be afraid.

160
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:06,875
Come.

161
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,416
You should leave now.

162
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:43,166
Why?

163
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:45,708
Who's that?

164
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,708
Why are you running?

165
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:06,125
There was only one place
where she could go.

166
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,416
A place with no life.

167
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:12,166
Why are you still here?
Go! Leave!

168
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,750
Save yourself

169
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:20,666
What are you doing here?

170
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:22,958
Leave.

171
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:26,666
And don't you dare come back.

172
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:31,708
I have looked into those same eyes.

173
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:43,458
You never listen to me, do you?

174
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:46,000
How many times have I told you
not to do that?

175
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:48,208
Out. Get out!
Go to the kitchen!

176
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:52,250
Shivangi, go home!
Your parents must be waiting for you.

177
00:22:58,625 --> 00:22:59,500
Go!

178
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:34,541
Everything will be fine.

179
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:35,625
Don't cry!

180
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:39,708
No… nothing will be fine.

181
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:43,125
You… know nothing.

182
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:46,625
Leave!

183
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,125
Go!

184
00:24:30,041 --> 00:24:30,916
Papa.

185
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:37,583
She's sleeping.

186
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:40,000
She'll be fine.

187
00:24:46,958 --> 00:24:48,083
Eat something.

188
00:24:49,208 --> 00:24:50,916
-Darshan.
-I'm not hungry.

189
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,041
You haven't eaten since yesterday.

190
00:24:56,416 --> 00:24:58,208
I won't leave my mother alone.

191
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:02,583
Come, eat.

192
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:05,625
I won't let Shivangi go either.

193
00:29:07,041 --> 00:29:08,041
Shivangi!

194
00:29:10,041 --> 00:29:11,000
That's mine…

195
00:29:16,375 --> 00:29:17,833
Give it to me!

196
00:29:26,291 --> 00:29:28,083
Okay that's enough.

197
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:31,208
Everything seems fine.

198
00:29:32,166 --> 00:29:33,125
I'll leave now.

199
00:29:34,416 --> 00:29:36,416
I'll show him out.
Let's go, doctor

200
00:29:40,791 --> 00:29:42,791
There's a lot of patients
in the village today.

201
00:29:48,208 --> 00:29:49,083
Shivangi.

202
00:29:54,958 --> 00:29:55,916
Shivangi!

203
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,166
What's happened?

204
00:29:57,958 --> 00:29:59,333
Do you need something?

205
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:02,833
-Everything okay?
-Looks like it.

206
00:30:03,833 --> 00:30:06,250
She needs something,
why aren't you helping her?

207
00:30:06,333 --> 00:30:07,916
Why don't you ask her yourself?

208
00:30:13,666 --> 00:30:14,833
It's nothing.

209
00:30:15,458 --> 00:30:16,416
Tea?

210
00:30:41,666 --> 00:30:42,500
There you are.

211
00:30:47,875 --> 00:30:50,000
Go. Get me some water.

212
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:51,625
Go.

213
00:31:28,541 --> 00:31:29,375
Go, sit.

214
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:33,291
What a hypocrite.

215
00:31:35,166 --> 00:31:37,166
I'm sick because of you.

216
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Because you failed
to give me a grandson.

217
00:31:42,791 --> 00:31:46,875
If only you had taken
that medicine I gave you.

218
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,333
Instead, you burdened my son
by giving him a daughter.

219
00:31:51,416 --> 00:31:54,750
If not my son,
you can at least think of your daughter

220
00:31:55,875 --> 00:31:57,958
Every girl needs a brother.

221
00:31:59,916 --> 00:32:01,750
You want everything your way.

222
00:32:03,083 --> 00:32:05,583
Your job, your house.

223
00:32:09,375 --> 00:32:12,625
{\an8}For generations, we've given this medicine
to give birth to boys.

224
00:32:13,916 --> 00:32:16,125
{\an8}But you want to do things your way.

225
00:32:28,875 --> 00:32:30,083
{\an8}Mama!

226
00:33:33,791 --> 00:33:34,708
Darshan!

227
00:35:14,666 --> 00:35:15,500
Darshan!

228
00:35:20,375 --> 00:35:21,416
Darshan!

229
00:35:23,083 --> 00:35:24,125
Darshan!

230
00:35:25,166 --> 00:35:26,166
Hurry!

231
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,000
Someone help!

232
00:36:28,625 --> 00:36:29,541
Auntie!

233
00:37:11,666 --> 00:37:12,833
Sit down!

234
00:37:24,166 --> 00:37:25,416
No one's going anywhere.

235
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,666
Have you thought about Shivangi?

236
00:37:35,291 --> 00:37:36,208
Or me?

237
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:41,500
Should I even be here in my condition?

238
00:37:48,625 --> 00:37:49,625
No one's leaving.

239
00:37:52,125 --> 00:37:54,833
What exactly happened, huh?
You were the only one here.

240
00:37:59,833 --> 00:38:00,708
Yes...

241
00:38:03,125 --> 00:38:04,333
I was the only one here.

242
00:38:05,708 --> 00:38:06,833
So?

243
00:38:08,708 --> 00:38:10,958
Today, everyone was there!
The whole village!

244
00:38:11,041 --> 00:38:12,416
What are you trying to say?

245
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:15,833
We need to go home.

246
00:38:19,291 --> 00:38:21,375
There's something very wrong here.

247
00:38:24,041 --> 00:38:26,416
But you should be happy.
You got what you wanted

248
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:32,250
Both of you, listen carefully.

249
00:38:32,916 --> 00:38:34,500
This is our house.

250
00:38:35,125 --> 00:38:37,291
And we're staying here.

251
00:38:38,208 --> 00:38:39,041
Is that clear?

252
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,833
Shivangi, you should sleep now.
It's late.

253
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:32,166
Come now, sleep.

254
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:46,416
Not sleepy?

255
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,958
Come on now, lay down.

256
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:06,333
Is it true that you all didn't want me?

257
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,916
Why? 

258
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:11,625
Who told you that?

259
00:40:14,375 --> 00:40:15,250
Grandma.

260
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:19,541
What grandma was saying the other day.

261
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:21,041
Oh, no.

262
00:40:22,625 --> 00:40:23,958
She didn't mean that.

263
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Look at me. Look there.

264
00:40:35,208 --> 00:40:37,125
Who does mama love the most?

265
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,041
-Me.
-Then?

266
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,333
I love you the most.

267
00:40:46,458 --> 00:40:47,500
Promise?

268
00:40:47,583 --> 00:40:48,833
Double promise.

269
00:40:54,833 --> 00:40:57,125
Come sleep.
Come.

270
00:42:31,291 --> 00:42:32,125
Shivangi.

271
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:06,750
Shivangi, what are you doing here?

272
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:32,583
Papa!

273
00:43:34,458 --> 00:43:35,541
Papa!

274
00:43:36,458 --> 00:43:38,000
Papa!

275
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,791
Papa!

276
00:43:42,541 --> 00:43:43,875
Are you trying to kill me?

277
00:43:43,958 --> 00:43:45,708
Papa…
Papa, please let me go…

278
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,041
You want to kill me?

279
00:43:49,875 --> 00:43:51,916
Papa it's me, Shivangi!

280
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:02,333
Papa!

281
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:05,250
Darshan?

282
00:44:07,625 --> 00:44:08,500
What happened?

283
00:44:09,125 --> 00:44:10,208
Darshan!

284
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:04,000
The curse is back.

285
00:46:51,541 --> 00:46:52,458
What happened? 

286
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:54,583
Tell me…

287
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:07,000
I saw a girl…

288
00:47:14,916 --> 00:47:18,375
And last night, papa…

289
00:47:22,416 --> 00:47:23,250
Shivangi!

290
00:47:25,625 --> 00:47:26,458
Shivangi!

291
00:47:26,958 --> 00:47:28,541
Auntie, is Shivangi there?

292
00:47:33,916 --> 00:47:34,875
Shivangi!

293
00:47:37,041 --> 00:47:37,875
Shivangi!

294
00:47:38,708 --> 00:47:40,458
-What happened to you?
-Come, child!

295
00:47:41,375 --> 00:47:42,208
Come on!

296
00:47:44,833 --> 00:47:47,541
Come, Shivangi, it's your father!

297
00:47:49,875 --> 00:47:51,291
Wait just a minute.

298
00:47:53,333 --> 00:47:54,500
Shivangi!

299
00:48:01,916 --> 00:48:03,083
Shivangi!

300
00:48:07,166 --> 00:48:08,666
We were worried about you.

301
00:48:12,125 --> 00:48:15,541
Your mother's very sick.

302
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,416
She can't walk.

303
00:48:18,416 --> 00:48:21,958
She's been vomiting since she woke up.
Maybe it's the weather

304
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:28,916
Come, let's go.

305
00:48:45,958 --> 00:48:47,666
She's burning up.

306
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:49,583
Priya?

307
00:48:50,541 --> 00:48:51,375
Priya?

308
00:49:03,416 --> 00:49:05,958
Don't come near.
You'll also get sick. Go!

309
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,958
Tara… Pooja… Pallavi.

310
00:50:06,333 --> 00:50:07,791
What are you doing here?

311
00:50:08,583 --> 00:50:09,500
Nothing.

312
00:50:09,583 --> 00:50:11,833
Just reading a book Baby lent me.

313
00:50:13,083 --> 00:50:14,125
My child.

314
00:50:15,458 --> 00:50:17,291
I'm going to the pharmacy.

315
00:50:18,208 --> 00:50:19,291
Wait, Papa…

316
00:50:19,375 --> 00:50:21,291
-I can go.
-No, you stay with mother.

317
00:50:21,416 --> 00:50:22,958
No, Papa, please let me go.

318
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,833
I'll come back soon. Please.

319
00:50:33,583 --> 00:50:34,500
Okay.

320
00:50:56,916 --> 00:50:58,916
PHARMACY

321
00:51:02,958 --> 00:51:05,875
When will we get our medicine?
After we die?

322
00:51:05,958 --> 00:51:07,666
Did you hear?

323
00:51:08,458 --> 00:51:11,375
They found Chinnu's nephew's body
in the fields.

324
00:51:11,958 --> 00:51:14,708
He had gone to the well
four or five days ago.

325
00:51:15,333 --> 00:51:18,125
Eleven people have died already.

326
00:51:18,916 --> 00:51:21,541
There's an epidemic in our village.

327
00:51:22,083 --> 00:51:26,166
No.
The village has been cursed by spirits.

328
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,458
What is it?

329
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:29,333
Tell me.

330
00:51:32,958 --> 00:51:34,333
First, you tell me.

331
00:51:36,083 --> 00:51:38,208
Whose names are these?

332
00:51:55,541 --> 00:51:57,416
Don't just stand there.

333
00:51:58,708 --> 00:52:00,791
At least you can come and sit beside her.

334
00:52:02,333 --> 00:52:03,208
Come.

335
00:52:24,125 --> 00:52:25,208
{\an8}SAKSHI

336
00:52:25,291 --> 00:52:26,541
Sakshi?

337
00:52:26,625 --> 00:52:28,375
Hurry up! People are waiting.

338
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:38,750
Give her to me.

339
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:42,000
This is your duty, Satya!

340
00:54:44,375 --> 00:54:46,375
One should not get attached to sparrows.

341
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:55,541
Come on! Hurry up!

342
00:55:57,875 --> 00:55:58,833
Quick!

343
00:55:58,916 --> 00:56:00,291
I'm not going in there.

344
00:56:00,375 --> 00:56:02,708
Why?
Come on!

345
00:56:05,166 --> 00:56:07,166
No wonder everyone calls you Baby!

346
00:56:09,208 --> 00:56:10,166
Shivangi!

347
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:11,416
Shivangi!

348
00:56:14,958 --> 00:56:16,166
Shivangi!

349
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:22,583
-Mama!
-Shivangi!

350
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:24,750
Go upstairs. Hurry.

351
00:56:26,125 --> 00:56:27,541
- Mama, the medicine…
- No,

352
00:56:27,625 --> 00:56:29,125
Don't come near me.

353
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:38,250
Auntie?
Auntie, what happened?

354
00:56:38,791 --> 00:56:40,000
Are you okay?

355
00:56:40,083 --> 00:56:41,166
Auntie.

356
00:56:42,208 --> 00:56:43,375
Auntie.

357
00:56:45,375 --> 00:56:47,375
Where's the baby?

358
00:56:48,625 --> 00:56:50,875
She was right here in my arms..

359
00:56:50,958 --> 00:56:52,541
She was right here!

360
00:56:52,916 --> 00:56:55,125
Sakshi! Our Sakshi!

361
00:56:55,791 --> 00:56:58,791
Where is she? Please find her!

362
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:05,333
Auntie, is this her?

363
00:57:09,166 --> 00:57:11,375
Yes. Your grandma was pregnant with her.

364
00:57:12,291 --> 00:57:14,000
When she was just about to be born

365
00:57:14,458 --> 00:57:15,666
Give it to me!

366
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:17,250
No! Don't!

367
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:18,541
Leave it!

368
00:57:19,333 --> 00:57:23,041
-Papa, stop!
-No! Don't!

369
00:57:24,083 --> 00:57:25,583
Don't tear it!

370
00:57:26,375 --> 00:57:28,291
Leave it!

371
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:31,500
Let her go, Auntie!

372
00:57:31,583 --> 00:57:33,166
Papa, stop!

373
00:57:34,416 --> 00:57:35,708
Please stop!

374
00:57:40,375 --> 00:57:41,375
Auntie!

375
00:57:54,208 --> 00:57:55,833
Open the door, Auntie!

376
00:57:56,750 --> 00:57:58,083
Open the door, Auntie!

377
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:01,541
I want that photo, Auntie!
Open the door, Auntie!

378
00:58:02,166 --> 00:58:03,500
Open the door!

379
00:58:08,208 --> 00:58:09,041
Shivangi!

380
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:18,041
Satya Auntie.

381
01:00:23,416 --> 01:00:24,416
Auntie!

382
01:00:35,666 --> 01:00:37,625
Auntie! Your book!

383
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:40,916
Auntie!

384
01:00:41,375 --> 01:00:43,166
Auntie! Your book!

385
01:00:51,291 --> 01:00:52,291
Auntie!

386
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:56,000
Give it!

387
01:01:03,291 --> 01:01:05,250
What's going on, Auntie?

388
01:01:20,791 --> 01:01:21,833
What is this?

389
01:01:26,291 --> 01:01:27,375
My stories…

390
01:01:28,833 --> 01:01:29,708
Yours?

391
01:01:30,833 --> 01:01:32,416
Real stories?

392
01:01:34,708 --> 01:01:35,541
Yes…

393
01:01:40,375 --> 01:01:42,208
Have you seen that girl?

394
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,291
She’s a spirit…

395
01:01:55,375 --> 01:01:56,916
from the black well,

396
01:01:59,083 --> 01:01:59,958
Like…

397
01:02:00,916 --> 01:02:02,333
all of these girls.

398
01:02:10,208 --> 01:02:12,666
You're just a child...
How will you understand?

399
01:02:20,208 --> 01:02:21,958
Many years ago…

400
01:02:23,375 --> 01:02:25,458
your grandmother was young then.

401
01:02:26,875 --> 01:02:31,041
Very happy,
because of your father's birth.

402
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:37,416
When Darshan turned five,

403
01:02:38,458 --> 01:02:41,291
your grandmother gave birth to a girl.

404
01:02:42,458 --> 01:02:43,750
A sweet little sparrow.

405
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,125
Sakshi.

406
01:02:48,333 --> 01:02:50,166
But she never got to fly free.

407
01:02:51,791 --> 01:02:53,916
A tradition was cruelly carried on,

408
01:02:54,625 --> 01:02:58,791
by the elders of the village.

409
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:18,000
She was swallowed by the well,

410
01:03:18,083 --> 01:03:20,750
like the other girls.

411
01:03:26,541 --> 01:03:28,916
When the elders died,

412
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,833
I hid all their sins.

413
01:03:38,541 --> 01:03:41,750
I buried all the unfortunate souls, but…

414
01:03:44,041 --> 01:03:45,375
I don't know…

415
01:03:46,833 --> 01:03:48,833
now it's been opened.

416
01:03:52,458 --> 01:03:54,000
Where is the well?

417
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,375
In our fields…

418
01:04:36,375 --> 01:04:37,375
Brother?

419
01:04:51,125 --> 01:04:52,166
I am Sakshi.

420
01:04:53,083 --> 01:04:54,291
What do you want?

421
01:05:03,166 --> 01:05:06,000
I made this for my little brother.

422
01:05:13,375 --> 01:05:15,083
Brothers don’t make <i>tadaagis.</i>

423
01:05:15,833 --> 01:05:17,375
But I've already made it. 

424
01:05:17,458 --> 01:05:20,875
That way we can hear him,
so he can always be protected.

425
01:05:22,458 --> 01:05:25,125
How are you so sure
you're going to have a brother?

426
01:05:27,541 --> 01:05:29,166
But I turned out to be a sparrow (girl).

427
01:05:37,625 --> 01:05:39,416
I was just a little boy then.

428
01:05:40,791 --> 01:05:42,333
You forgot about me…

429
01:05:44,083 --> 01:05:46,583
and became one of them.

430
01:05:46,666 --> 01:05:48,083
No, I never forgot…

431
01:05:48,541 --> 01:05:50,166
I didn't have a choice.

432
01:05:57,125 --> 01:05:57,958
Now you do.

433
01:06:01,125 --> 01:06:02,458
Come with me.

434
01:06:28,583 --> 01:06:30,041
Papa!

435
01:06:35,458 --> 01:06:36,625
Papa!

436
01:06:37,375 --> 01:06:38,833
Papa!

437
01:08:15,166 --> 01:08:18,416
Can't you see the village is cursed?

438
01:08:18,916 --> 01:08:20,500
We're all going to die!

439
01:08:26,583 --> 01:08:32,625
This house is cursed.

440
01:08:34,458 --> 01:08:36,041
It's cursed.

441
01:08:36,125 --> 01:08:37,708
Mama!

442
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,083
What is it?

443
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,083
That girl…

444
01:08:48,125 --> 01:08:49,000
Papa…

445
01:08:51,416 --> 01:08:53,083
near the well…

446
01:08:53,791 --> 01:08:55,000
Papa is... gone.

447
01:09:00,333 --> 01:09:02,000
We need to leave right away.

448
01:09:03,125 --> 01:09:04,125
Auntie…

449
01:09:04,583 --> 01:09:07,250
please don't let anything happen
to Shivangi.

450
01:09:38,958 --> 01:09:39,791
Chandni!

451
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:43,666
What happened to you, child?

452
01:09:50,041 --> 01:09:53,250
Get out of the child!
Take me!

453
01:09:53,333 --> 01:09:55,000
I will take you all!

454
01:11:11,958 --> 01:11:13,708
We're all going to die.

455
01:11:16,375 --> 01:11:18,125
We're all going to die…

456
01:11:18,208 --> 01:11:20,041
We have to go right away.

457
01:11:20,125 --> 01:11:22,291
My house… hurry!

458
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:24,625
Hurry!

459
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Come on. Be brave.

460
01:11:28,791 --> 01:11:29,708
Be brave!

461
01:12:16,208 --> 01:12:17,208
Let go!

462
01:12:18,333 --> 01:12:20,083
Let go of me!

463
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,333
Stop!

464
01:12:24,250 --> 01:12:25,916
Leave her!

465
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,041
Let go!

466
01:12:44,291 --> 01:12:45,458
Put her in the closet!

467
01:12:45,958 --> 01:12:47,791
Open it!

468
01:13:18,916 --> 01:13:20,750
Shivangi, please save me!

469
01:13:28,625 --> 01:13:29,666
Shivangi.

470
01:13:31,708 --> 01:13:33,375
She's calling out to you.

471
01:13:35,125 --> 01:13:36,250
Do you hear her?

472
01:13:38,291 --> 01:13:39,125
Mama?

473
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:42,458
She's coming for all of us.

474
01:13:51,708 --> 01:13:52,541
And she…

475
01:13:53,375 --> 01:13:55,083
wants my baby.

476
01:14:02,083 --> 01:14:04,375
You’re going to be a big sister.

477
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:16,916
That's the reason she's calling for you.

478
01:14:20,416 --> 01:14:21,250
But…

479
01:14:21,875 --> 01:14:23,125
but why me?

480
01:14:25,541 --> 01:14:27,791
This tradition has been going on for ages.

481
01:14:29,041 --> 01:14:30,208
But it's evil.

482
01:14:31,666 --> 01:14:33,291
And must be stopped…

483
01:14:34,916 --> 01:14:36,333
You are the new generation.

484
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,083
New thinking.

485
01:14:40,791 --> 01:14:42,666
She needs you, Shivangi.

486
01:15:55,041 --> 01:15:55,875
Shivangi!

487
01:15:58,250 --> 01:15:59,958
Shivangi, save me!

488
01:16:01,375 --> 01:16:02,291
Baby?

489
01:21:19,291 --> 01:21:20,250
No!

490
01:21:23,791 --> 01:21:26,250
I won't let you take her!

491
01:21:51,791 --> 01:21:53,375
I will save you!

492
01:22:00,166 --> 01:22:02,000
I will save you.

493
