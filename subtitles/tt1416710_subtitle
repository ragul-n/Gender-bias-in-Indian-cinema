1
00:00:52,616 --> 00:00:55,983
"My life has been illuminated."

2
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:10,430
"Flower of love, after
uniting with you..

3
00:01:10,567 --> 00:01:14,833
..my life has been illuminated."

4
00:01:24,981 --> 00:01:27,848
Sir. Sir. The Boss
is calling you.

5
00:01:47,604 --> 00:01:48,969
What is this?
- A letter.

6
00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:51,598
I know it is a letter. What
have you written in it?

7
00:01:51,741 --> 00:01:53,800
It is a simple letter. Don't
you know to read it?

8
00:01:53,944 --> 00:01:54,968
Shut up! Answer my question!

9
00:01:55,112 --> 00:01:56,136
What have you written in it?

10
00:01:56,613 --> 00:01:58,137
I have written that
my mother is serious.

11
00:01:58,615 --> 00:01:59,604
Last month you took
leave saying..

12
00:01:59,749 --> 00:02:00,738
..it was your mother's
death ceremony.

13
00:02:00,884 --> 00:02:01,873
Now you have asked
for leave because..

14
00:02:02,018 --> 00:02:03,007
..your mother is serious
in the hospital.

15
00:02:03,153 --> 00:02:04,085
Are you playing a prank on me?

16
00:02:04,855 --> 00:02:06,550
Who would play pranks
about mother?

17
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,555
On Monday you said you have
a hip pain and ran away.

18
00:02:08,692 --> 00:02:09,681
On Tuesday you said
it was a headache.

19
00:02:09,826 --> 00:02:10,815
On Wednesday you said
it was a back ache.

20
00:02:10,961 --> 00:02:11,950
On Thursday you said it
was your bottom pain.

21
00:02:12,095 --> 00:02:13,562
What is all this?

22
00:02:13,697 --> 00:02:14,755
Would you accept it
if I said that..

23
00:02:14,898 --> 00:02:16,559
..I have a pain in the
same place everyday?

24
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,758
No.

25
00:02:17,901 --> 00:02:18,890
Even now you can tell me what..

26
00:02:19,035 --> 00:02:20,024
..pain you like l
will write that.

27
00:02:21,171 --> 00:02:22,570
Mr. Ranga, tell me the truth
why do you have to go?

28
00:02:22,706 --> 00:02:24,435
King Harishchandra went
to the graveyard..

29
00:02:24,574 --> 00:02:26,667
..after telling the truth.
I don't like that job, sir.

30
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:27,777
You are not Harishchandra
and I am..

31
00:02:27,911 --> 00:02:28,935
..not sage Vishwamitra.

32
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,774
Tell the truth and only then
will I sanction the leave.

33
00:02:30,914 --> 00:02:32,108
Otherwise I won't
give you leave!

34
00:02:32,883 --> 00:02:34,578
I want to go to see my wife.

35
00:02:34,718 --> 00:02:36,845
Is your wife important to
you or your office work?

36
00:02:36,987 --> 00:02:38,784
Is your wife important to
you or your office work?

37
00:02:38,922 --> 00:02:40,787
For me? Office work
is important to me.

38
00:02:40,924 --> 00:02:42,619
Your case is different
from mine.

39
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:43,953
My wife is important to me.

40
00:02:44,094 --> 00:02:45,584
Oh! Mr. Ranga!

41
00:02:45,729 --> 00:02:47,458
If you keep arguing with me..

42
00:02:47,597 --> 00:02:48,859
..Iike this I am going
to dismiss you!

43
00:02:48,999 --> 00:02:50,591
I am going to dismiss you!

44
00:02:50,734 --> 00:02:52,599
Even if you die you
can't dismiss me.

45
00:02:52,736 --> 00:02:53,862
Why? Why not!?

46
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,477
Ranga, think well before
you draw black lines..

47
00:03:01,611 --> 00:03:03,636
..on a white paper. Think
well. Please don't!

48
00:03:05,782 --> 00:03:06,806
Resignation letter!!

49
00:03:07,951 --> 00:03:09,816
There is not even a little
seriousness in your life.

50
00:03:09,953 --> 00:03:12,080
Mr. Ranga, I won't accept
your resignation letter!

51
00:03:12,856 --> 00:03:14,756
Do you hear me? I won't
accept you resignation!

52
00:03:14,891 --> 00:03:16,552
You have to come to
office tomorrow!

53
00:07:52,969 --> 00:07:53,936
Dear, why did you come
here running like this?

54
00:07:54,571 --> 00:07:55,833
Who was chasing you?

55
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:00,772
I am practising running
race for the Olympics!

56
00:08:01,911 --> 00:08:03,105
Look how you are laughing!

57
00:08:04,781 --> 00:08:06,510
My Kamala should always be
smiling like this lotus.

58
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,515
There is happy news.
- What is it?

59
00:08:09,652 --> 00:08:12,052
I have resigned my job.
- What?

60
00:08:12,522 --> 00:08:14,513
He said I don't accept
your resignation!

61
00:08:14,657 --> 00:08:15,885
This is happy news.

62
00:08:16,025 --> 00:08:17,390
What happy? I thought I could..

63
00:08:17,527 --> 00:08:19,518
..have resigned and stayed
near you always.

64
00:08:20,663 --> 00:08:21,721
Happy news number two!

65
00:08:21,865 --> 00:08:23,730
I have vacated the house
where we lived.

66
00:08:25,835 --> 00:08:27,393
Did you vacate the house
or did he chase you out..

67
00:08:27,537 --> 00:08:28,799
..because you didn't
pay the rent?

68
00:08:28,938 --> 00:08:31,532
Why would he chase me? That
house chased me out.

69
00:08:31,674 --> 00:08:33,539
Yesterday there was
heavy rainfall.

70
00:08:40,683 --> 00:08:42,548
Rangaswamy! Rangaswamy!

71
00:08:44,687 --> 00:08:47,554
What are you doing sitting
on the stool?

72
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:50,420
Me? I am wondering where..

73
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,552
..to search for fish
in this pond.

74
00:08:53,696 --> 00:08:56,096
Forget about catching the fish.
First throw me the rent?

75
00:08:56,566 --> 00:08:57,828
Do you have any self respect?

76
00:08:57,967 --> 00:09:01,095
Sun, rain and moon light
falls on the head.

77
00:09:01,838 --> 00:09:03,772
How can you ask for rent
for this house that..

78
00:09:03,907 --> 00:09:05,898
..Iooks like a gutter flowing
by the road side?

79
00:09:06,042 --> 00:09:07,771
After living in this
stinky place..

80
00:09:07,911 --> 00:09:09,902
..my wife has gone
to the hospital.

81
00:09:10,046 --> 00:09:12,446
I have lost 3000 Rs
because of you.

82
00:09:12,916 --> 00:09:14,178
What can I do about that?

83
00:09:14,918 --> 00:09:16,783
Just keep 1000 Rs
for the house..

84
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,182
..rent and give me 2000 Rs.

85
00:09:18,321 --> 00:09:19,288
Oh no! You cheat!

86
00:09:19,923 --> 00:09:21,914
Softly! Softly! Your
heart might stop!

87
00:09:22,058 --> 00:09:23,787
Will you pay up the
rent decently or..

88
00:09:23,927 --> 00:09:25,918
..should I have your belongings
thrown out?

89
00:09:26,062 --> 00:09:27,927
Basanna, how can you
get so heated up?

90
00:09:28,932 --> 00:09:30,126
Please come and sit down.

91
00:09:30,266 --> 00:09:31,995
Will you give the rent?
- I'll give it. Come and sit.

92
00:09:32,268 --> 00:09:35,965
Cool down a little.
Do you want the rent?

93
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,134
Won't I give you the rent?

94
00:09:38,274 --> 00:09:40,208
You are a very nice guy.

95
00:09:43,947 --> 00:09:46,279
Here you are! Take the rent!

96
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,945
Basanna! Do you want the
rent!? Here take it.

97
00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:54,215
Shall I give you the rent?

98
00:10:03,232 --> 00:10:04,290
You have left the house you had.

99
00:10:04,901 --> 00:10:06,493
Where will you live now?

100
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,899
There is no dearth for
houses in Bangalore.

101
00:10:09,038 --> 00:10:10,266
Only the rents are
a little high.

102
00:10:10,907 --> 00:10:13,432
I saw a place. I saw
a To-let board.

103
00:10:19,983 --> 00:10:22,110
There is a to-let board
outside. The door is open.

104
00:10:22,251 --> 00:10:23,912
It appears there's someone
in the house too.

105
00:10:24,053 --> 00:10:25,281
Who is inside?

106
00:10:25,922 --> 00:10:28,914
Who is it?
- Is it you Aunt?

107
00:10:29,058 --> 00:10:30,457
Who is the aunt!?
- You!

108
00:10:30,927 --> 00:10:32,292
I felt like living
in this house.

109
00:10:32,428 --> 00:10:34,123
That's why I have come.
What is the rent?

110
00:10:34,263 --> 00:10:36,026
So you have come to rent
the house, have you?

111
00:10:36,165 --> 00:10:38,156
Come and take a look at
the house. Come inside.

112
00:10:40,303 --> 00:10:42,032
This is the house. That
is the kitchen.

113
00:10:43,172 --> 00:10:44,196
This house looks like paradise.

114
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,329
This is more than enough.

115
00:10:45,475 --> 00:10:46,442
It is 50 Rs. But I won't
give it to you.

116
00:10:46,576 --> 00:10:48,942
Why? - I won't give the
house to a bachelor.

117
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,946
Aunty! Aunty! I am
a married bachelor.

118
00:10:53,082 --> 00:10:55,141
I have a wife.
- In that case bring your wife.

119
00:10:55,284 --> 00:10:56,273
Let her see the house.

120
00:10:56,419 --> 00:10:57,943
She might object
to things later.

121
00:10:58,087 --> 00:10:59,952
She is in no condition to come.
- Why?

122
00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:01,954
She is in the hospital.
- Is it the first delivery?

123
00:11:02,091 --> 00:11:03,820
Yes, 1st delivery
and madness too.

124
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,949
How much advance do I give you?

125
00:11:05,094 --> 00:11:06,083
Shall I give you
2 months advance?

126
00:11:06,229 --> 00:11:07,253
I don't want any advance.

127
00:11:07,397 --> 00:11:09,228
Just give me the rent
promptly every month.

128
00:11:09,365 --> 00:11:10,354
That's it.

129
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,762
Hail my aunty, who in the
present times that too in..

130
00:11:11,901 --> 00:11:13,926
..this city is giving
the house..

131
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,264
..on rent without
taking an advance.

132
00:11:16,406 --> 00:11:18,067
Hail my aunty!

133
00:11:39,228 --> 00:11:40,456
Hello!
- Hello!

134
00:11:42,198 --> 00:11:43,859
I am the lawyer in
the opposite house.

135
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,989
My name is Subburam. -I'm
very glad to meet you.

136
00:11:45,134 --> 00:11:46,123
Are you new here?

137
00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:47,258
Yes. I have come here newly.

138
00:11:47,403 --> 00:11:48,927
I am staying on rent in this
house. - Glad! I'm very glad.

139
00:11:49,072 --> 00:11:51,131
Tomorrow is a race. The derby!

140
00:11:52,275 --> 00:11:53,936
I don't know a thing
about the derby.

141
00:11:54,077 --> 00:11:56,136
It is the derby! The race.
- Is it? Bye then.

142
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:57,803
Mr. Opposite house, if you
have any case please..

143
00:11:57,947 --> 00:12:01,280
..bring it to me I'll
do a good job of it.

144
00:12:01,417 --> 00:12:03,009
Of course there is no one
else I can rely up on.

145
00:12:03,152 --> 00:12:04,244
I'll come later. We can talk.

146
00:12:08,157 --> 00:12:09,146
When your husband is here..

147
00:12:09,292 --> 00:12:10,281
..I don't know how
the time goes by.

148
00:12:11,894 --> 00:12:14,886
It is 5 o clock. Why hasn't
your husband come yet?

149
00:12:15,031 --> 00:12:17,261
How can he come so soon?
- Why?

150
00:12:18,901 --> 00:12:20,926
I saw him at some place.

151
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,765
Oh yes. I saw him
at the Poornima..

152
00:12:22,905 --> 00:12:25,100
..silk house on my way here.

153
00:12:25,241 --> 00:12:26,265
What was he doing there?

154
00:12:26,409 --> 00:12:27,774
A girl's sari was
a little askew..

155
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,174
..and he was adjusting
it for her.

156
00:12:32,315 --> 00:12:34,112
I know about his nature!

157
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:38,186
He is waiting for me
to kick the bucket.

158
00:12:38,321 --> 00:12:41,779
As soon as I die he will
marry another woman..

159
00:12:41,924 --> 00:12:45,189
..and throw a stone
on that child.

160
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,255
Kamala, you are very lucky.

161
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,196
Your husband dotes on his wife.

162
00:12:52,935 --> 00:12:54,129
Mother!

163
00:12:54,937 --> 00:12:57,462
Anusuya? Was the doctor here?

164
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,931
Did he tell you when
you can go home?

165
00:13:00,943 --> 00:13:02,137
How are you?

166
00:13:02,278 --> 00:13:03,870
How does it matter how I am?

167
00:13:04,013 --> 00:13:05,241
Who was she first tell me that?
- Who was who?

168
00:13:05,381 --> 00:13:07,406
That woman! That beauty!!

169
00:13:08,151 --> 00:13:09,880
The one who is enticing
you at this age

170
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,419
Who is that? Who
the hell is she?

171
00:13:12,889 --> 00:13:14,754
That same woman whose sari
you were adjusting..

172
00:13:14,891 --> 00:13:19,419
..in full public view
at Poornima silk house.

173
00:13:20,196 --> 00:13:21,754
Oh no! Mother that was not..

174
00:13:21,898 --> 00:13:23,160
..a girl it was a mannequin.

175
00:13:23,299 --> 00:13:24,766
Dad thought that
the sari on the..

176
00:13:24,901 --> 00:13:27,233
..mannequin would
look nice on you.

177
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:29,895
Sir, I believe it was
only a mannequin.

178
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:32,098
Dear, was it just a mannequin?

179
00:13:32,241 --> 00:13:33,765
Whether it is a mannequin
on a real woman..

180
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:36,936
..I don't think it is
right for a man to..

181
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:38,103
Is this the way to cause
misunderstanding..

182
00:13:38,247 --> 00:13:39,271
..and watch the fun?

183
00:13:39,415 --> 00:13:41,110
My husband is like God.

184
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,911
How can you lie about him?

185
00:13:43,052 --> 00:13:45,282
Poor thing. As it is
she is all shivers.

186
00:13:45,421 --> 00:13:46,911
Why did you do harass her?

187
00:13:47,056 --> 00:13:48,785
Kamalu, I only wanted
to test if she is..

188
00:13:48,925 --> 00:13:51,917
..Anusuya or jealous!!

189
00:13:52,061 --> 00:13:54,120
Of course I am jealous.
- Good, good.

190
00:13:54,263 --> 00:13:55,787
It should be so too. Any
woman who is jealous..

191
00:13:55,932 --> 00:13:59,299
..only proves that she is
very fond of her husband.

192
00:13:59,435 --> 00:14:01,460
Am I correct?
- Correct. Correct.

193
00:14:01,938 --> 00:14:03,132
Give her the sari.

194
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:09,075
Sister, sister. -
- Yes.

195
00:14:09,212 --> 00:14:11,203
I was waiting just for you.
- Why?

196
00:14:11,881 --> 00:14:14,975
Dr. Subbu asked me to
give you this rose.

197
00:14:15,117 --> 00:14:16,243
Thank you.

198
00:14:16,886 --> 00:14:18,945
Come here. Come here!

199
00:14:19,088 --> 00:14:21,079
He can give her the
rose if he wishes to.

200
00:14:21,224 --> 00:14:22,953
Why are you doing the
job of a mediator?

201
00:14:23,092 --> 00:14:24,992
How can he ever get
that courageous?

202
00:14:25,127 --> 00:14:26,424
She is very shy and so is he.

203
00:14:27,196 --> 00:14:28,288
Sister, check the temperature.

204
00:14:28,431 --> 00:14:29,898
I'll go and meet the doctor.

205
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:40,133
Subbu, how's my lady? How
does her health look?

206
00:14:40,276 --> 00:14:41,903
Not bad. Sit down.

207
00:14:42,044 --> 00:14:44,444
I am thinking of a new
treatment. - Go ahead.

208
00:14:44,914 --> 00:14:47,007
Our chief has gone to Hyderabad.

209
00:14:47,149 --> 00:14:49,174
I am thinking of starting
it as soon as he comes.

210
00:14:49,318 --> 00:14:50,910
Why do you want to wait
until he arrives?

211
00:14:51,053 --> 00:14:52,315
Start it your self.

212
00:14:52,455 --> 00:14:55,151
I can start it. That
is not a problem.

213
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:57,452
But it will cost some money.

214
00:14:58,194 --> 00:14:59,286
All right. What would
be the expenses?

215
00:14:59,929 --> 00:15:01,328
Maybe about 3000 Rs.

216
00:15:01,464 --> 00:15:03,193
All right let it be just take
it. It is no big deal.

217
00:15:03,266 --> 00:15:06,929
Hey Ranga, I am not
only a doctor to you.

218
00:15:07,069 --> 00:15:08,400
I am also your friend.

219
00:15:08,871 --> 00:15:10,839
You talk as if we are
in the school days.

220
00:15:10,973 --> 00:15:12,736
I know where you are working..

221
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,206
..and how much you earn.

222
00:15:14,343 --> 00:15:15,401
Not bad!

223
00:15:15,878 --> 00:15:17,869
How do you know what
I myself don't know?

224
00:15:19,015 --> 00:15:20,744
The onus of giving the
treatment is yours..

225
00:15:20,883 --> 00:15:22,282
..and that of arranging
the money is mine.

226
00:15:23,419 --> 00:15:24,943
When my chief comes I will
try for the concession.

227
00:15:25,087 --> 00:15:26,281
No trying business!

228
00:15:27,423 --> 00:15:28,754
Just tell me when you want..

229
00:15:28,891 --> 00:15:30,153
..the money and how
much you want.

230
00:15:30,293 --> 00:15:32,261
I'll bring it. That's all.

231
00:15:34,163 --> 00:15:35,755
What can I do if you ask for..

232
00:15:35,898 --> 00:15:36,922
..3000 Rs all of
a sudden, Ranga?

233
00:15:37,066 --> 00:15:38,158
Am I asking for it simply?

234
00:15:38,301 --> 00:15:39,427
Give it to me from
my provident fund.

235
00:15:39,902 --> 00:15:40,926
I know it.

236
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,094
But you have already taken..

237
00:15:42,238 --> 00:15:43,227
..maximum loan from
your provident fund.

238
00:15:43,372 --> 00:15:46,933
What do I do now? I need
3000 Rs urgently.

239
00:15:47,977 --> 00:15:49,035
If you had asked me
for it two days ago..

240
00:15:49,178 --> 00:15:50,167
..I could have given it to you.

241
00:15:50,313 --> 00:15:51,302
I had 30,000 Rs of

242
00:15:51,447 --> 00:15:53,005
But now I have invested
it in lands.

243
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,913
I am really helpless.
Sorry, Ranga.

244
00:15:57,053 --> 00:15:59,317
It's all right. I will try
elsewhere. Thank you.

245
00:16:39,428 --> 00:16:42,420
Dear, did you find money
growing on trees?

246
00:16:42,865 --> 00:16:44,162
Why?
- What else?

247
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,289
Why are you showing me
such a big house and..

248
00:16:45,434 --> 00:16:46,423
..saying that it is our house?

249
00:16:46,569 --> 00:16:49,003
This is the house that
will suit us best.

250
00:16:49,905 --> 00:16:51,167
How does the garden look?

251
00:16:51,907 --> 00:16:53,431
Veranda for outdoor romance.

252
00:16:53,909 --> 00:16:55,900
Bedroom for secret romance.

253
00:16:57,046 --> 00:16:58,274
Drawing room for
general romance.

254
00:16:59,415 --> 00:17:00,780
I told you before
we were married..

255
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:02,178
..that we must have a house
like this, didn't it?

256
00:17:02,318 --> 00:17:03,376
That was then.

257
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,951
After marriage you
must do as I say.

258
00:17:06,088 --> 00:17:08,215
This is not the house
we will live in.

259
00:17:08,858 --> 00:17:11,190
The plan is different.
- Which one is it?

260
00:17:11,861 --> 00:17:13,089
This is our house!

261
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:18,860
This is the veranda. This
is the dining room.

262
00:17:23,005 --> 00:17:24,870
This is the hall and
this is the bedroom.

263
00:17:25,007 --> 00:17:26,235
This is everything. Ok?

264
00:17:26,876 --> 00:17:28,741
How can we live
in such a small..

265
00:17:28,878 --> 00:17:32,143
If the house is big
we will be far away.

266
00:17:32,882 --> 00:17:35,146
If the house is small we can
stay close to each other.

267
00:17:35,284 --> 00:17:39,152
Isn't that what we need
for romancing? - How?

268
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:43,256
Is it like this? -
- Yes.

269
00:17:44,894 --> 00:17:46,919
Not like this. Like that!

270
00:18:05,014 --> 00:18:09,849
"Like the fragrance mingles
with the flower."

271
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:29,132
"Precious, let our lives
mingle in the same way."

272
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,069
Advance!

273
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:35,871
What a time he has
chosen to come?

274
00:18:36,011 --> 00:18:37,740
Doesn't this idiot have
any knowledge..

275
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,142
..about what time to come?

276
00:18:40,282 --> 00:18:42,876
I am Baddi Basavaiah! The
owner of this house.

277
00:18:43,018 --> 00:18:44,246
Where is the advance?

278
00:18:44,386 --> 00:18:46,980
I get the salary only after
working hard for 30 days

279
00:18:47,123 --> 00:18:48,750
I give the house on rent only..

280
00:18:48,891 --> 00:18:50,085
..after taking the advance.

281
00:18:50,226 --> 00:18:51,250
People who give advance don't..

282
00:18:51,393 --> 00:18:52,382
..usually pay the rent promptly.

283
00:18:52,895 --> 00:18:54,760
Will you take 3 month's
advance and lose out..

284
00:18:54,897 --> 00:18:56,922
..on 6 months rent or
do you want to take..

285
00:18:57,066 --> 00:18:58,260
..monthly rent without
taking the advance?

286
00:18:59,401 --> 00:19:01,164
I will take both the
advance and the rent.

287
00:19:02,905 --> 00:19:05,100
Shall I write to the
rent controller..

288
00:19:05,241 --> 00:19:06,299
..that you don't give
me a receipt?

289
00:19:06,442 --> 00:19:08,342
Shall I announce that
you take black money?

290
00:19:08,477 --> 00:19:11,605
Shall I shout? Shall
I shout? Shall l..

291
00:19:13,249 --> 00:19:14,443
Basanna!

292
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,107
Dear, didn't I give
you 300Rs to pay..

293
00:19:16,252 --> 00:19:18,482
..the advance? What
did you do with that?

294
00:19:18,621 --> 00:19:22,489
What did I do? I converted
the notes into a sari.

295
00:19:23,626 --> 00:19:26,254
Why did you waste it?!
- What is a waste?

296
00:19:26,395 --> 00:19:27,794
Did I waste the money
on gambling?

297
00:19:28,264 --> 00:19:29,288
Did I spend it on
smoking cigarettes?

298
00:19:29,431 --> 00:19:30,796
Did I lose the money on
race or have drinks?

299
00:19:31,567 --> 00:19:33,125
I bought this pretty sari
to drape and beautify..

300
00:19:33,269 --> 00:19:35,533
..this body and decorate it.

301
00:19:36,672 --> 00:19:38,469
Why are you calling your
husband's gift a waste?

302
00:19:38,607 --> 00:19:40,268
Here wear it.
- I don't want it.

303
00:19:42,411 --> 00:19:44,379
Will you wear it or shall
I put it on for you?

304
00:19:44,513 --> 00:19:45,537
Oh no!

305
00:19:49,685 --> 00:19:53,143
In order to enhance the
beauty of pretty women..

306
00:19:53,289 --> 00:19:57,521
..use only pretty Kamal
Georgette saris.

307
00:19:59,662 --> 00:20:02,426
Let the sari be. Tell
me. How do I look?

308
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:05,426
You look like an angel!

309
00:20:06,569 --> 00:20:08,230
You are like cupid's consort.

310
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,235
There is no limit
to your beauty.

311
00:20:11,373 --> 00:20:13,102
Had I given the advance
to that stupid owl..

312
00:20:13,242 --> 00:20:15,472
..would we have enjoyed
this pleasure.

313
00:20:17,613 --> 00:20:19,513
Oh no! It is time
for your office!

314
00:20:19,648 --> 00:20:22,242
Oh no! This is half
an hour fast.

315
00:20:22,384 --> 00:20:24,443
I have a lot of time. I can
leave after having coffee.

316
00:20:24,587 --> 00:20:27,488
No. no. there is no need
for that. Come on now.

317
00:20:35,264 --> 00:20:36,458
Good morning, sir.

318
00:20:42,605 --> 00:20:44,266
Good morning.
- Good morning.

319
00:20:46,408 --> 00:20:48,808
How is your married life?

320
00:20:49,278 --> 00:20:52,270
It is like there is a stone
in my food. - Why is that so?

321
00:20:52,414 --> 00:20:54,609
How do I tell you my story?

322
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,275
It is time for the office
when I'm in a good mood.

323
00:20:57,419 --> 00:20:59,512
It dawns at the right time.

324
00:20:59,655 --> 00:21:01,145
The whole world
falls ill can't..

325
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:03,554
..the sun catch a cold
or have a cough?

326
00:21:04,693 --> 00:21:06,217
He comes promptly at
6 in the morning.

327
00:21:06,362 --> 00:21:11,493
Why can't he take rest
and come at 1 1 - 12?

328
00:21:14,637 --> 00:21:16,571
You are laughing. I
have my own problems.

329
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,509
I have to talk to
the boss about..

330
00:21:32,655 --> 00:21:33,644
..something important.

331
00:21:45,267 --> 00:21:47,258
Good morning.
- What is it, Ranga?

332
00:21:48,404 --> 00:21:50,497
Phone.
- To whom? - PWD.

333
00:21:51,273 --> 00:21:52,467
Go ahead.

334
00:21:59,615 --> 00:22:02,812
Hello! Enquiries.
- It is Ranga here.

335
00:22:04,219 --> 00:22:05,311
What is this, dear?

336
00:22:05,454 --> 00:22:07,217
It hasn't even been an hour
since you went to office.

337
00:22:07,356 --> 00:22:08,584
And you have already called.

338
00:22:08,724 --> 00:22:10,214
What can I do? It is urgent.

339
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:13,226
What is urgent?
- When do I get to see you?

340
00:22:13,362 --> 00:22:16,490
After 5.
- Oh no! I can't wait until 5.

341
00:22:16,632 --> 00:22:18,259
You must give it at 3.

342
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,463
What do you want?
- That file.

343
00:22:24,606 --> 00:22:28,269
What file?
- The rose coloured. Pink. Pink.

344
00:22:29,411 --> 00:22:34,508
Rose coloured file. - Are
you talking about the sari?

345
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:39,451
Yes. Sari. Sorry sir, I said
sari instead of sorry.

346
00:22:40,589 --> 00:22:42,250
Did you get what I said? You
should give it to me by 3.

347
00:22:42,391 --> 00:22:44,450
It won't do if you delay
it. Bye then bye.

348
00:22:50,265 --> 00:22:51,527
Thank you, sir.

349
00:22:56,672 --> 00:22:59,539
What is the time? Sorry.
It is 12.35. Isn't it?

350
00:23:04,213 --> 00:23:06,204
Something important.

351
00:23:12,354 --> 00:23:15,255
PWD. Phone. File. The clerk.

352
00:23:18,227 --> 00:23:19,489
Thank you, sir.

353
00:23:23,632 --> 00:23:27,261
Hello! Enquires.
- Ranga here.

354
00:23:28,404 --> 00:23:30,099
Dear, if you call me
every hour they..

355
00:23:30,239 --> 00:23:33,470
..will just send you back home.

356
00:23:33,609 --> 00:23:35,099
That is exactly what I need.

357
00:23:35,244 --> 00:23:36,506
I can stay beside
always you see.

358
00:23:36,645 --> 00:23:38,374
How long will you look for
the rose coloured file?

359
00:23:38,514 --> 00:23:40,482
I won't keep quiet if you keep
delaying it for so long.

360
00:23:41,617 --> 00:23:43,414
Will you disconnect
the phone now?

361
00:23:43,552 --> 00:23:46,350
No. I have to have the
rose coloured file.

362
00:23:47,489 --> 00:23:49,514
My officer is very good.
He hasn't said a thing.

363
00:23:50,659 --> 00:23:52,126
If you make me remind
you about it again..

364
00:23:52,261 --> 00:23:53,626
..I will get angry that's it.

365
00:23:54,763 --> 00:23:56,526
Ranga, will they not react
if you speak so roughly?

366
00:23:56,665 --> 00:23:58,257
Won't they mind it?
- Let them think what they want.

367
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,267
Only I know my problem.
Thank you, sir. Bye.

368
00:24:02,404 --> 00:24:03,735
Innocent fellow.
Innocent fellow.

369
00:24:11,213 --> 00:24:13,204
Is it something important?

370
00:24:17,352 --> 00:24:19,081
Mr. Murthy, we had announced
that 28th was..

371
00:24:19,221 --> 00:24:20,483
..the last date to
receive the tender.

372
00:24:22,624 --> 00:24:24,251
Is it about the rose file?
Here take it.

373
00:24:25,394 --> 00:24:26,486
Thank you, sir.

374
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:30,596
But what has happened is yours
was delayed by a day.

375
00:24:30,732 --> 00:24:32,222
But we had sent it
correctly, sir.

376
00:24:34,369 --> 00:24:37,338
Dear, I beg of you.
Don't disturb me.

377
00:24:37,473 --> 00:24:39,566
How can you trouble me
during working hours?

378
00:24:39,708 --> 00:24:41,437
I too am saying that
it is working time.

379
00:24:43,579 --> 00:24:45,376
Oh my! Oh my!

380
00:24:45,514 --> 00:24:46,503
What happened, Ranga!
What happened?

381
00:24:46,648 --> 00:24:49,481
Chest pain!
- Sit down, Ranga. Take rest.

382
00:24:49,618 --> 00:24:50,607
I'll call for the doctor.
Please wait.

383
00:24:51,253 --> 00:24:53,244
I'll go and fetch the
rose coloured file.

384
00:24:53,388 --> 00:24:54,514
No, no. health is important.

385
00:24:54,656 --> 00:24:56,248
No duty is important.
- Health is important!

386
00:24:56,391 --> 00:24:58,291
Rose colour is important!
- Health is important!

387
00:24:58,427 --> 00:25:00,292
Rose colour is important.
- I say health is important!

388
00:25:00,429 --> 00:25:01,521
No! Rose is important!

389
00:25:01,663 --> 00:25:02,755
Health is!
- Rose!

390
00:25:03,265 --> 00:25:04,391
Heath!
- Rose!

391
00:25:04,533 --> 00:25:06,364
Health!
- Rose!

392
00:25:07,503 --> 00:25:08,561
Why did you keep calling
and saying rose?!

393
00:25:08,704 --> 00:25:10,262
Yes. Rose is important to me.

394
00:25:10,405 --> 00:25:11,565
Again you are saying rose.

395
00:25:11,707 --> 00:25:12,731
Yes. It is the colour
of your sari.

396
00:25:13,208 --> 00:25:15,073
All that looks good at home.

397
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:16,734
In the office the office
work is important.

398
00:25:17,212 --> 00:25:19,544
For me office and
home are the same.

399
00:25:20,215 --> 00:25:22,080
By calling me every
hour you neither..

400
00:25:22,217 --> 00:25:24,412
..allow me to work
nor do you work.

401
00:25:24,553 --> 00:25:25,542
What can I do?

402
00:25:25,687 --> 00:25:27,086
I go to office with the
intention to work but..

403
00:25:27,222 --> 00:25:29,213
..when I open the file
I see only your face.

404
00:25:29,358 --> 00:25:31,087
I have many desires,
many thoughts..

405
00:25:31,226 --> 00:25:34,218
..and many imaginations.

406
00:25:34,363 --> 00:25:35,591
What imaginations?

407
00:25:51,747 --> 00:25:53,578
"l saw a howdah on an elephant."

408
00:25:53,715 --> 00:25:55,774
"l saw you in the howdah."

409
00:25:56,251 --> 00:25:59,482
"l saw myself sitting near you."

410
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,551
"l saw a howdah on an elephant."

411
00:26:06,695 --> 00:26:08,185
"l saw you in the howdah."

412
00:26:09,331 --> 00:26:12,198
"l saw myself sitting near you."

413
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:22,276
"l too saw a palace. And
saw you inside it too."

414
00:26:26,815 --> 00:26:31,252
"And along with it l

415
00:26:33,388 --> 00:26:35,447
"l saw a howdah on an elephant."

416
00:26:35,591 --> 00:26:37,752
"l saw you in the howdah."

417
00:26:38,226 --> 00:26:41,627
"l saw myself sitting near you."

418
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,569
"l saw the shimmering
water in Bridavan."

419
00:27:23,705 --> 00:27:27,232
"ln the dancing colourful
lights I saw you."

420
00:27:27,376 --> 00:27:29,071
"l saw myself standing near..

421
00:27:29,211 --> 00:27:31,441
..you holding your waist."

422
00:27:40,589 --> 00:27:44,753
"l saw a woman's statute
at the Belur temple."

423
00:27:45,527 --> 00:27:47,085
"l saw a bewitched
you standing..

424
00:27:47,229 --> 00:27:51,757
..and watching her
beauty in longing."

425
00:27:54,236 --> 00:27:56,295
"l saw a howdah on an elephant."

426
00:27:56,438 --> 00:27:58,463
"l saw you in the howdah."

427
00:27:58,607 --> 00:28:01,770
"l saw myself sitting near you."

428
00:28:05,714 --> 00:28:09,514
"l too saw a palace. And
saw you inside it too."

429
00:28:14,656 --> 00:28:18,558
"And along with it l
saw myself with you."

430
00:28:55,731 --> 00:28:57,096
"l saw Lord Ranga's temple
at Srirangapatna."

431
00:28:57,232 --> 00:28:59,598
"l saw you lying down
like lord Ranganatha."

432
00:29:05,073 --> 00:29:09,601
"l saw myself near you
like Goddess Sridevi."

433
00:29:18,754 --> 00:29:22,815
"l saw you come up from
the sea of milk."

434
00:29:23,959 --> 00:29:29,625
"l saw myself trap you in
the temple of my heart."

435
00:29:31,767 --> 00:29:34,133
"l saw a howdah on an elephant."

436
00:29:34,603 --> 00:29:36,867
"l saw you in the howdah."

437
00:29:37,005 --> 00:29:39,838

438
00:29:43,979 --> 00:29:47,642
"l too saw a palace. And

439
00:29:47,783 --> 00:29:51,981

00:29:52,621 --> 00:29:54,816
"l saw a howdah on an elephant."

441
00:29:54,956 --> 00:29:57,982
"l saw the officer
near the door."

442
00:29:58,126 --> 00:29:59,821
What do we do now?

443
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:17,936
Sir, everyone has left.

444
00:30:24,085 --> 00:30:25,643
Sir, it is going to 6 o'clock.
At least you go home.

445
00:30:29,791 --> 00:30:31,588
Let me sit here and do my work.

446
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:38,793
Hello!

447
00:30:38,934 --> 00:30:40,595
Why haven't you come
home yet? Come soon.

448
00:30:40,735 --> 00:30:41,963
Why go you get angry with me?

449
00:30:42,103 --> 00:30:43,968
I'll come over in just two
minutes. In just 2 minutes.

450
00:30:44,606 --> 00:30:46,836
Sir, who was it?
- Nothing. It was my wife.

451
00:30:46,975 --> 00:30:48,602
I had promised to take
her to the cinema.

452
00:30:48,743 --> 00:30:49,869
It is late and forgot
in your entire ruckus.

453
00:30:50,011 --> 00:30:51,000
She is getting angry with me.

454
00:30:52,147 --> 00:30:55,639
Ranga, let me go. I beg
of you. What is all this?

455
00:30:55,784 --> 00:30:57,979
Please, please!

456
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,927
Kamalu!
- Have you got new clothes?

457
00:31:09,564 --> 00:31:11,429
Not new clothes. Soiled clothes
that I had sent to..

458
00:31:11,566 --> 00:31:12,760
..the washer man to get washed.

459
00:31:12,901 --> 00:31:14,425
Oh no! Did you give so many..

460
00:31:14,569 --> 00:31:16,560
..clothes to the washer man?

461
00:31:16,705 --> 00:31:20,607
What is this, dear?
- What is it, dear?

462
00:31:20,742 --> 00:31:23,939
Do you intend running a
family or running away?

463
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,445
If I want to have a family
I want to do so by..

464
00:31:26,581 --> 00:31:28,606
..Ioving you or
by carrying you..

465
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:31,617
..Iike a little baby
and run away.

466
00:31:31,753 --> 00:31:33,584
Oh no! Listen to me.

467
00:31:33,722 --> 00:31:34,780
Do you think that things will..

468
00:31:34,923 --> 00:31:35,947
..remain the same always?

469
00:31:36,091 --> 00:31:37,956
What will happen?
- Expenses will increase.

470
00:31:38,093 --> 00:31:39,117
Let it be.

471
00:31:40,595 --> 00:31:42,586
Smart people should know
the value of money.

472
00:31:42,731 --> 00:31:43,720
Yes they should know.

473
00:31:43,865 --> 00:31:44,854
They should save every penny.

474
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,989
Yes. They should.

475
00:31:46,134 --> 00:31:47,123
We should save.
- We should save.

476
00:31:47,269 --> 00:31:48,600
We should save.
- We should save.

477
00:31:48,737 --> 00:31:51,604
I am telling you so.
- Is it? All right teacher.

478
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,935
I will listen to what
you say from tomorrow.

479
00:31:54,075 --> 00:31:55,770
But now you must listen to me.

480
00:31:55,911 --> 00:31:57,469
What does that mean?
- It means..

481
00:31:57,612 --> 00:32:02,811
You look very pretty when
you get angry. - So?

482
00:32:02,951 --> 00:32:07,581
So.. that's it.
- Oh no! I will scream.

483
00:32:07,722 --> 00:32:09,815
I will lock your mouth.
- Oh no!

484
00:32:12,961 --> 00:32:15,555
Kamalu! Kamalu, some
coffee, dear.

485
00:32:15,697 --> 00:32:18,564
First bow to God.
- I just did.

486
00:32:19,567 --> 00:32:20,829
Not to me. Bow to god.

487
00:32:20,969 --> 00:32:22,630
I just bowed to the god
who will give me coffee.

488
00:32:25,774 --> 00:32:27,708
Have this.
- What is this?

489
00:32:27,842 --> 00:32:28,831
This is Neem leaves
and molasses.

490
00:32:28,977 --> 00:32:29,966
Isn't today the festival
of Ugadi?

491
00:32:30,111 --> 00:32:32,636
Should I eat it? The Neem
leaves are very bitter.

492
00:32:32,781 --> 00:32:34,112
Give me only the molasses.

493
00:32:35,583 --> 00:32:37,448
This signifies that
we must accept the..

494
00:32:37,585 --> 00:32:40,577
..joys and sorrows
of life equally.

495
00:32:40,722 --> 00:32:42,815
Please take it happily
don't say no.

496
00:32:47,963 --> 00:32:51,865
Is it bitter?
- No. It is very sweet.

497
00:32:53,601 --> 00:32:55,466
My precious, how can there..

498
00:32:55,603 --> 00:32:57,594
..be bitterness and
sorrow in our lives?

499
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:03,575
Your and my life is the
union of milk and honey.

500
00:33:03,712 --> 00:33:04,906
What did I say now?

501
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:09,577
Your and my life is the
union of milk and honey.

502
00:33:22,731 --> 00:33:25,564
Kamalu! What happened, kamalu!

503
00:33:26,701 --> 00:33:28,692
Kamalu! Kamalu!

504
00:33:36,845 --> 00:33:37,937
What is this dear?

505
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,570
They said blood test
and now this x-ray.

506
00:33:40,715 --> 00:33:41,773
We seem to be making trips..

507
00:33:41,916 --> 00:33:42,940
..to the hospital everyday.

508
00:33:43,084 --> 00:33:44,984
Kamalu, the doctor is a
very good friend of mine.

509
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,917
He has taken special interest.

510
00:33:47,055 --> 00:33:48,454
He will check correctly and..

511
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:49,648
..give the best medicine

512
00:34:18,753 --> 00:34:20,084
What are you staring at?

513
00:34:21,623 --> 00:34:26,754
That doll is so cute. I
feel like carrying it.

514
00:34:27,896 --> 00:34:29,420
Just be patient for a few days..

515
00:34:29,564 --> 00:34:34,797
..you can carry a living doll.

516
00:34:36,938 --> 00:34:38,565
Mr. Ranga, please come in.

517
00:34:49,717 --> 00:34:52,117
Your wife needs complete
bed rest.

518
00:34:52,587 --> 00:34:54,953
I am giving medicines for now.

519
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:57,785
What about the blood
test results?

520
00:34:57,926 --> 00:35:00,622
I'll tell you on Monday.
- Thank you.

521
00:35:10,538 --> 00:35:12,062
Mr. Ranga, one minute.

522
00:35:18,546 --> 00:35:20,537
You should be very brave.

523
00:35:20,682 --> 00:35:22,081
You must listen to me carefully.

524
00:35:22,851 --> 00:35:26,582
Your wife is suffering
from blood cancer!

525
00:35:28,723 --> 00:35:33,751
No! No! Please don't say that!
Please don't say so!

526
00:35:33,895 --> 00:35:36,659
Do another blood
test if you must.

527
00:35:36,798 --> 00:35:38,561
There is no use in getting
agitated about it now.

528
00:35:39,701 --> 00:35:40,759
Control yourself.

529
00:35:40,902 --> 00:35:43,097
Take good care of her as
long as she is alive.

530
00:35:43,905 --> 00:35:45,429
If you yourself get
so discouraged..

531
00:35:45,573 --> 00:35:46,801
..the she will be more scared.

532
00:35:47,942 --> 00:35:49,739
Please gather yourself.
Gather yourself.

533
00:36:10,532 --> 00:36:12,523
The doctor called you,
didn't she?

534
00:36:12,667 --> 00:36:13,895
What did she say?

535
00:36:17,539 --> 00:36:18,733
Is it that?

536
00:37:21,869 --> 00:37:23,769
Dear! Hey!
- What is it?

537
00:37:25,907 --> 00:37:27,807
Just one thing.
- What is it?

538
00:37:27,942 --> 00:37:29,068
Will you listen to what I say?

539
00:37:30,545 --> 00:37:31,807
When have I not listened
to what you say?

540
00:37:31,946 --> 00:37:39,751
Put that pot down. Put it down.
- Here.

541
00:37:40,888 --> 00:37:42,549
Come with me.
- Why?

542
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:44,817
Come when I ask you to.
Don't ask me why?

543
00:37:51,966 --> 00:37:53,934
Sit down. Just sit down.

544
00:37:57,872 --> 00:37:59,840
What is it, dear? At this time.

545
00:38:05,913 --> 00:38:06,902
Kamalu!

546
00:38:13,054 --> 00:38:16,046
"Sit down and relax
like a queen."

547
00:38:16,524 --> 00:38:18,515
"Like an empress."

548
00:38:19,661 --> 00:38:21,390
"Who will do the household
chores?"

549
00:38:21,529 --> 00:38:22,894
"Will your uncle do it?"

550
00:38:23,798 --> 00:38:26,767
"Don't tire yourself hereafter."

551
00:38:27,902 --> 00:38:31,770
"I'll finish all the chores
and you'll admire me then."

552
00:38:34,542 --> 00:38:37,534
"Sit down and relax
like a queen."

553
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,908
"Like an empress."

554
00:39:08,209 --> 00:39:11,303
"What nonsense is this?
How can a man cook?"

555
00:39:13,181 --> 00:39:16,412
"Weren't Bhimasena
and King Nala men?"

556
00:39:25,393 --> 00:39:29,056
"Weren't Bhimasena
and King Nala men?"

557
00:39:29,197 --> 00:39:30,789
"Weren't they warriors who..

558
00:39:30,932 --> 00:39:33,196
..sported a moustache like me?"

559
00:39:36,337 --> 00:39:38,805
"Until yesterday you toiled..

560
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:43,934
..and filled life
into this home."

561
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:46,944
"Let me serve you
at least today."

562
00:39:51,085 --> 00:39:54,350
"Sit down and relax
like a queen."

563
00:39:54,956 --> 00:39:56,947
"Like an empress."

564
00:39:58,092 --> 00:40:00,959
"Don't tire yourself hereafter."

565
00:40:02,096 --> 00:40:06,157
"I'll finish all the chores
and you'll admire me then."

566
00:40:29,323 --> 00:40:31,257
Why do you have tears
in your eyes?

567
00:40:33,394 --> 00:40:36,454
There are not tears
they are perfume.

568
00:40:38,266 --> 00:40:39,790
"Why should I have
tears in my eyes..

569
00:40:39,934 --> 00:40:42,027
..when I have a wife like gold?"

570
00:40:51,179 --> 00:40:52,806
"Why talk about worries
when she does..

571
00:40:52,947 --> 00:40:55,040
.. everything knowing
my feelings?"

572
00:40:55,183 --> 00:40:57,811
"lf you keep smiling it is as..

573
00:40:57,952 --> 00:41:03,185
..if that paradise has
slipped into our home."

574
00:41:04,258 --> 00:41:08,160
"A wife is not a maid and
a husband is not a king."

575
00:41:11,299 --> 00:41:14,097
"Sit down and relax
like a queen."

576
00:41:14,902 --> 00:41:16,267
"Like an empress."

577
00:41:17,405 --> 00:41:20,431
"Don't tire yourself hereafter."

578
00:41:21,209 --> 00:41:26,146
"I'll finish all the chores
and you'll admire me then."

579
00:41:30,918 --> 00:41:32,909
Kamalu!

580
00:42:23,905 --> 00:42:25,270
Why are you looking
at it like that?

581
00:42:26,908 --> 00:42:28,273
Are you wondering what
is in that box?

582
00:42:28,409 --> 00:42:30,900
Money. Full of money!
Five lakhs.

583
00:42:33,047 --> 00:42:34,912
Do you know why l
have kept it here?

584
00:42:35,049 --> 00:42:36,175
To give it away.

585
00:42:36,317 --> 00:42:38,911
To give it to someone
in need of money.

586
00:42:40,054 --> 00:42:42,181
Not a loan. For free. A gift.

587
00:42:42,924 --> 00:42:48,157
Did you need money?
Only for bachelors.

588
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:50,192
Only bachelors are eligible.

589
00:42:50,932 --> 00:42:53,162
I am a bachelor.
- Education?

590
00:42:53,935 --> 00:42:55,129
I am a graduate.

591
00:42:55,269 --> 00:42:56,258
Do you have a job?

592
00:42:56,404 --> 00:42:57,928
It is because I have a job that
I am relaxing in the park.

593
00:42:59,073 --> 00:43:00,301
You are very lucky.

594
00:43:00,942 --> 00:43:02,933
You have earned money
very easily.

595
00:43:03,077 --> 00:43:09,073
How much money do you want?
- Money!

596
00:43:09,216 --> 00:43:10,877
Is it money only if
there are notes?

597
00:43:11,018 --> 00:43:12,246
Is cheque not money?

598
00:43:12,386 --> 00:43:13,410
Do you see these photos?

599
00:43:13,888 --> 00:43:15,753
They are all rich girls
who will bring lots..

600
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:17,881
..of dowry to the person
they will marry.

601
00:43:18,025 --> 00:43:20,892
Marriage broker.
- That's become a cheap word.

602
00:43:21,028 --> 00:43:22,893
Call me marriage uncle.
- Uncle?

603
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:24,759
Such people usually
sport a small..

604
00:43:24,899 --> 00:43:26,161
..ponytail and wear Dhoti.

605
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:27,892
All that is the old type.

606
00:43:28,035 --> 00:43:29,764
At an age when guys
have Amitabh Bachan..

607
00:43:29,904 --> 00:43:31,769
..hair cut and girls are
imitating Hema Malini..

608
00:43:31,906 --> 00:43:34,136
..hair style can we continue
to be the same?

609
00:43:34,275 --> 00:43:35,765
Not only that. After my
son finished his bar..

610
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:37,935
..at law in London he has
ordered me to wear..

611
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:41,139
..a suit even when
I sleep at night.

612
00:43:41,282 --> 00:43:42,772
Why are you doing this
business at this age..

613
00:43:42,917 --> 00:43:44,942
..when you have a son
who is a bar at law..

614
00:43:45,086 --> 00:43:46,075
..instead of sitting in a room
and enjoying your drink?

615
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:47,778
Mister, I don't know how
much law my son has..

616
00:43:47,922 --> 00:43:52,120
..studied but he has
opened a bar at home.

617
00:43:52,259 --> 00:43:55,456
I have to earn at least
to meet his expenses.

618
00:43:56,197 --> 00:43:59,462
Look. Ms. Pankaja. BA.

619
00:44:00,201 --> 00:44:03,932
Height 4.7 weight
120 dowry 10,000.

620
00:44:07,141 --> 00:44:13,080
Next. Ms. Uma. MSc. Height
5 feet. Weight 130.

621
00:44:13,214 --> 00:44:16,342
Colour black. Dowry 20,000.

622
00:44:20,221 --> 00:44:22,246
Miss. Manorama, Pre university.

623
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:26,087
Average height. Good weight.
Dowry 25,000.

624
00:44:27,228 --> 00:44:29,128
Something else has fallen.
This is 5 thousand.

625
00:44:29,263 --> 00:44:30,252
Mister, it is not 5 thousand.
It is 5,000.

626
00:44:31,399 --> 00:44:34,891
It is 50,000. Just
take a look at her.

627
00:44:35,903 --> 00:44:37,996
This is a different case.
Name is Meena.

628
00:44:38,139 --> 00:44:40,437
Age 18. Colour red rose.

629
00:44:40,908 --> 00:44:42,773
If anyone wants to touch
he can do so only..

630
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:44,172
..after washing his
hands with Dettol.

631
00:44:45,312 --> 00:44:47,246
Some medical shop guy
would be better.

632
00:44:47,915 --> 00:44:49,109
Not like that.

633
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:50,774
It is enough if
he is a guy who..

634
00:44:50,918 --> 00:44:52,112
..is willing to obey
his mother-in-law.

635
00:44:52,253 --> 00:44:54,084
Her mother is Shantamma.

636
00:44:54,221 --> 00:44:55,279
She is very bad tempered.

637
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:57,015
Her father is Ugranarasimha.

638
00:44:57,158 --> 00:44:59,149
He is a very mild
tempered person.

639
00:44:59,293 --> 00:45:01,090
She also has a brother,
Prahlada.

640
00:45:01,228 --> 00:45:03,162
He won't cross the line
drawn by his parents.

641
00:45:03,264 --> 00:45:05,232
They have property
worth 2 crores.

642
00:45:06,133 --> 00:45:07,725
Half for the son and half
for the daughter..

643
00:45:07,868 --> 00:45:10,098
I wonder who is lucky
to get that.

644
00:45:11,238 --> 00:45:14,401
Mr. Marriage uncle,
all I need is 3000.

645
00:45:14,875 --> 00:45:17,867
I don't have people for such
petty amounts on my list.

646
00:45:18,012 --> 00:45:19,741
Just tell me that you
are willing to..

647
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:21,142
..be a son-in-law befitting
the mother-in-law.

648
00:45:21,282 --> 00:45:22,271
I'll get this girl..

649
00:45:41,902 --> 00:45:43,096
Oh no! My leg is broken.

650
00:45:45,906 --> 00:45:47,100
Madam, are you in your senses?

651
00:45:47,241 --> 00:45:48,902
Are you driving to kill?

652
00:45:49,043 --> 00:45:51,011
He came and fell in
front of the car.

653
00:45:51,145 --> 00:45:52,169
Just keep quiet.

654
00:45:52,313 --> 00:45:53,302
Even if he came and fell
in front of the car..

655
00:45:53,447 --> 00:45:54,436
..doesn't the car have
a horn or a brake.

656
00:45:55,182 --> 00:45:56,171
Please carry him and
put him in the car.

657
00:45:56,317 --> 00:45:57,306
I'll take him to the hospital.

658
00:45:57,451 --> 00:45:58,782
Not done! Not done!

659
00:45:58,919 --> 00:46:02,184
You have run over his leg.
- Ah! My leg is broken!

660
00:46:02,323 --> 00:46:03,722
Keep quiet, we are
questioning her.

661
00:46:03,858 --> 00:46:04,950
Don't shout. Wait.

662
00:46:05,092 --> 00:46:06,184
Just give us 500 Rs.

663
00:46:06,327 --> 00:46:07,726
We'll let you take the
car only after that.

664
00:46:07,862 --> 00:46:08,851
We'll take care of him.

665
00:46:08,996 --> 00:46:10,725
500 Rs? I don't have that
much money with me.

666
00:46:10,865 --> 00:46:12,162
We'll let you take the
car only after that.

667
00:46:12,299 --> 00:46:14,267
That's right. All
that won't work.

668
00:46:14,401 --> 00:46:15,390
You must give the
money when asked.

669
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:17,861
Make way. Looks like
an influential man.

670
00:46:18,005 --> 00:46:19,939
How can I give the money
that I don't have?

671
00:46:20,074 --> 00:46:22,065
You should've thought of that
while driving the car.

672
00:46:22,209 --> 00:46:24,074
Look there. His leg is
stuck under the tyre.

673
00:46:24,211 --> 00:46:26,202
Brother, its ok. Just
be a little patient.

674
00:46:27,348 --> 00:46:29,043
How could you drive your
car without any money?

675
00:46:29,183 --> 00:46:30,878
You asked the right
question, sir.

676
00:46:31,018 --> 00:46:32,144
This is not a chicken business.

677
00:46:32,286 --> 00:46:33,253
Just shut your mouth.
I'll ask her.

678
00:46:33,888 --> 00:46:35,412
What do you have to say?

679
00:46:38,893 --> 00:46:40,224
Why are you crying?

680
00:46:40,361 --> 00:46:45,128
Pals, this lady is shedding
tears. Come with me.

681
00:46:48,269 --> 00:46:50,897
How much money have
you asked her?

682
00:46:52,039 --> 00:46:54,439
500. - 500. She doesn't
have any money.

683
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:57,434
There is a chain on her neck.

684
00:46:58,212 --> 00:46:59,941
If it is sold you
can get 2000 Rs.

685
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,913
Shall I get it for you?
- Do that.

686
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:03,982
In that case we will have to
break another leg of his.

687
00:47:04,118 --> 00:47:05,210
Go ahead and break it.

688
00:47:08,856 --> 00:47:10,187
Get into the car.
- Why?

689
00:47:10,324 --> 00:47:11,848
Just sit inside. I'll
tell you. Sit.

690
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:14,122
Hold onto to him well.

691
00:47:14,261 --> 00:47:15,250
Why should you hold on to me?

692
00:47:15,396 --> 00:47:16,988
Nothing. Anyway one of
your legs is broken.

693
00:47:17,131 --> 00:47:18,723
If both your legs are broken..

694
00:47:18,866 --> 00:47:19,855
..you will get 2000
Rs. that's why!

695
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,194
Oh no! Oh no! Don't! Don't!

696
00:47:21,335 --> 00:47:22,893
Don't worry. We'll break
only your leg.

697
00:47:23,037 --> 00:47:24,834
We won't break anything else.

698
00:47:24,972 --> 00:47:27,065
Oh no! Don't, don't!
Someone save me!

699
00:47:27,208 --> 00:47:28,732
Someone save me!

700
00:47:28,876 --> 00:47:31,811
Let me go. Let me go! My leg!

701
00:47:31,946 --> 00:47:36,383
Leave me! I'll run away!

702
00:47:36,517 --> 00:47:39,918
Just watch! I'll
show you the fun!

703
00:47:48,829 --> 00:47:50,319
Come here! I'll get you 2000 Rs.

704
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:04,304
Did you see how they ran?

705
00:48:04,445 --> 00:48:06,072
That is the way to make
such people run.

706
00:48:06,213 --> 00:48:07,840
But how did you get this idea?

707
00:48:07,982 --> 00:48:09,210
After seeing your tears.

708
00:48:10,851 --> 00:48:12,216
You have done me a
great favour today.

709
00:48:12,353 --> 00:48:13,843
This is no big deal. Bye.

710
00:48:14,989 --> 00:48:16,388
You must come to my house.

711
00:48:16,857 --> 00:48:18,848
Are you scared to go home? Ok.

712
00:48:20,995 --> 00:48:24,226
Please come. Mother! Mother!

713
00:48:25,866 --> 00:48:27,060
What is it, dear?

714
00:48:27,201 --> 00:48:30,398
Mother, I was in great
trouble today.

715
00:48:30,871 --> 00:48:32,133
I was driving my car.

716
00:48:32,273 --> 00:48:33,865
One man came and fell in front
of my car purposely.

717
00:48:34,008 --> 00:48:35,737
He said that his leg is
broken and threatened..

718
00:48:35,876 --> 00:48:37,867
..to let me go only
if I give him 500 Rs.

719
00:48:38,012 --> 00:48:39,741
There was a big commotion and..

720
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,074
..many people gathered there.

721
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:43,080
They were all on his side.
And all I had was 100 Rs.

722
00:48:43,217 --> 00:48:44,275
How did you come home then?

723
00:48:44,418 --> 00:48:45,885
That was when he appeared
like God.

724
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:47,419
Otherwise it would have
been very difficult.

725
00:48:48,188 --> 00:48:49,985
My mother.
- Greetings.

726
00:48:53,127 --> 00:48:54,754
The onus of giving the
treatment is yours..

727
00:48:54,895 --> 00:48:56,260
..and that of arranging
the money is mine.

728
00:48:57,398 --> 00:49:00,925
Aren't you aunty Shantamma? -
- Yes..

729
00:49:01,068 --> 00:49:04,469
You are.. - It is me.
How would you remember?

730
00:49:05,606 --> 00:49:07,096
How would you remember poor..

731
00:49:07,241 --> 00:49:08,401
..me while sitting on
a hoard of money?

732
00:49:09,543 --> 00:49:11,340
Aren't you Manji's son?

733
00:49:11,478 --> 00:49:13,241
It has been ages since l
saw you. Come over here.

734
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:14,608
Sit down. Sit down.

735
00:49:14,748 --> 00:49:16,773
But last week Manji was here.

736
00:49:17,251 --> 00:49:18,616
He never told me that
you are in this city.

737
00:49:19,253 --> 00:49:21,483
Who is Manji?
- The man from Mysore.

738
00:49:23,257 --> 00:49:24,451
Not at all.

739
00:49:26,593 --> 00:49:28,254
Aren't you Karigiri's
son Krishna?

740
00:49:28,395 --> 00:49:30,260
Who is that Karigiri now?
- Karigiri from Madras.

741
00:49:31,398 --> 00:49:33,263
Not at all.

742
00:49:36,403 --> 00:49:39,304
Is it Seetharamaiah
from Singapore..

743
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,271
I am Ranga.

744
00:49:41,408 --> 00:49:45,344
Seetharamaiah's son
from Singapore.

745
00:49:45,479 --> 00:49:48,277
Is it? Please come,
my boy. Sit down.

746
00:49:48,415 --> 00:49:50,542
When I saw you, you
were just this tall.

747
00:49:50,684 --> 00:49:52,276
You have grown so tall.

748
00:49:52,419 --> 00:49:55,445
Time and tide wait for none.

749
00:49:57,591 --> 00:49:59,525
Aunty shantamma, where
is your son prahalada?

750
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:00,649
I don't see him.

751
00:50:02,296 --> 00:50:04,230
There he is. Where
are you off to?

752
00:50:04,365 --> 00:50:06,333
m-f, I'm going to the library.
- Come back soon.

753
00:50:06,467 --> 00:50:07,491
All right, mother.

754
00:50:08,635 --> 00:50:11,763
Aunty Shantamma, your
son still obeys you!

755
00:50:12,239 --> 00:50:13,433
Yes, yes.

756
00:50:15,576 --> 00:50:17,771
Is this Meena? -
- Yes.

757
00:50:18,545 --> 00:50:20,103
She was the little girl with
thin plaits running..

758
00:50:20,247 --> 00:50:24,479
..around sucking her thumb
without clothes.

759
00:50:25,519 --> 00:50:27,248
Can she remain the
same even now?

760
00:50:27,388 --> 00:50:29,788
Girls are such. They
grow very fast.

761
00:50:30,257 --> 00:50:33,454
Where is MR. Ugranarashimha?

762
00:50:33,594 --> 00:50:36,791
Shanta.
- Please come.

763
00:50:37,564 --> 00:50:39,122
This is my father's friend
Seetharamaiah's..

764
00:50:39,266 --> 00:50:41,257
..son from Singapore.

765
00:50:42,403 --> 00:50:44,268
My name is Ranga.
- Greetings.

766
00:50:44,405 --> 00:50:45,463
Greetings. How are you?

767
00:50:45,606 --> 00:50:46,630
I am fine. How are you?

768
00:50:46,774 --> 00:50:48,469
Thanks to your blessings
I am fine too.

769
00:50:48,609 --> 00:50:49,633
Please sit down.

770
00:50:49,777 --> 00:50:51,142
Shanta, they have sent a tax..

771
00:50:51,278 --> 00:50:53,269
..notice from the corporation.

772
00:50:53,414 --> 00:50:54,608
What's their problem?

773
00:50:55,282 --> 00:50:56,806
I just sent them a 1000
Rs. the other day!

774
00:50:57,584 --> 00:50:58,551
I don't know about that.
But they have sent this.

775
00:51:01,688 --> 00:51:03,280
They all only use English.
Take a look at this.

776
00:51:07,227 --> 00:51:08,421
This is a question paper.

777
00:51:08,562 --> 00:51:10,359
But this man said
it was a tax paper.

778
00:51:19,506 --> 00:51:22,236
Shantamma aunty, this
is a corporation tax.

779
00:51:22,376 --> 00:51:23,502
This should not be retained.

780
00:51:23,644 --> 00:51:24,633
As you get the notice you
must keep disbursing it.

781
00:51:24,778 --> 00:51:25,745
Why simply get into trouble?

782
00:51:26,246 --> 00:51:28,612
That is right too.

783
00:51:36,256 --> 00:51:37,450
Question paper!!

784
00:51:38,592 --> 00:51:42,289
I don't know who you are.
Thanks for the favour.

785
00:51:42,429 --> 00:51:44,454
It is your money I got for you.

786
00:51:44,598 --> 00:51:45,622
I have a doubt.

787
00:51:46,266 --> 00:51:48,461
Why were you shivering while
talking to your wife?

788
00:51:48,602 --> 00:51:51,264
Do you have fever?

789
00:51:51,405 --> 00:51:53,464
Why are you scared of your wife?

790
00:51:53,607 --> 00:51:54,631
You don't know about this house.

791
00:51:54,775 --> 00:51:56,470
She is the key to the
coffers of this house.

792
00:51:56,610 --> 00:51:58,134
Even if I ask for 1
rupee to buy poison..

793
00:51:58,278 --> 00:52:00,303
..she has to sanction it.

794
00:52:00,447 --> 00:52:02,472
Have you taken dowry from
your wife? -- Yes.

795
00:52:05,552 --> 00:52:09,488
Dear! Dear! You asked for
corporation tax money.

796
00:52:09,623 --> 00:52:12,421
Here you are. Just count
it and give it to him

797
00:52:20,567 --> 00:52:25,436
Not bad you have reached
here before me.

798
00:52:26,507 --> 00:52:28,566
Not bad at all. You
are quite shrewd!

799
00:52:28,709 --> 00:52:30,108
Did you plan to negotiate
directly and wind..

800
00:52:30,244 --> 00:52:33,372
..up the commission
that I will be due?

801
00:52:33,514 --> 00:52:34,776
Who do you think he is?

802
00:52:35,516 --> 00:52:37,108
He is my father's friend
Seetharamaiah's..

803
00:52:37,251 --> 00:52:40,243
..son from Singapore.

804
00:52:41,388 --> 00:52:43,788
What are you dong here?
- Business.

805
00:52:44,258 --> 00:52:46,453
What business?
- Chit fund business.

806
00:52:47,594 --> 00:52:49,118
Aunty shantamma, I can see..

807
00:52:49,263 --> 00:52:51,458
..prosperity glitter
on your face.

808
00:52:52,599 --> 00:52:53,588
You look like an incarnation..

809
00:52:53,734 --> 00:52:54,723
..of the goddess of wealth!

810
00:52:54,868 --> 00:52:56,130
Just try giving 10,000
Rs. from your..

811
00:52:56,270 --> 00:52:57,294
..hands to our chit
fund business.

812
00:52:57,437 --> 00:52:59,598
You will see for yourself
how well the business does.

813
00:53:01,742 --> 00:53:03,539
Why are you in doubt?
Just give it.

814
00:53:04,211 --> 00:53:08,375
He is handsome. He is a
graduate. Still unmarried.

815
00:53:09,516 --> 00:53:11,416
He should keep frequenting
your house.

816
00:53:13,554 --> 00:53:15,215
Mother, can you give me
the keys. I'll fetch it.

817
00:53:15,355 --> 00:53:16,754
No. I'll bring it myself.

818
00:53:17,558 --> 00:53:20,220
Sir, I must leave now.
I have some work.

819
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:22,225
All right. Good bye.

820
00:53:28,502 --> 00:53:30,493
Not bad you cut goods jokes.

821
00:53:31,638 --> 00:53:34,334
I thought I was really at peace
with life without worries.

822
00:53:34,474 --> 00:53:36,442
But you seem to be more
at peace than I am.

823
00:53:36,577 --> 00:53:37,601
Me?

824
00:53:38,245 --> 00:53:40,236
Take this. It is 10,000 Rs.

825
00:53:44,384 --> 00:53:46,249
Thank you aunty Santamma!
Thank you!

826
00:53:47,387 --> 00:53:48,615
3000 Rs.

827
00:53:49,756 --> 00:53:51,348
Will you start the new
treatment from tomorrow?

828
00:53:51,491 --> 00:53:53,254
Where was all this money?

829
00:53:53,393 --> 00:53:56,260
I stole it! Why should
that concern you?

830
00:53:58,398 --> 00:53:59,797
Will you start the treatment
tomorrow itself?

831
00:54:00,567 --> 00:54:01,795
I'll do it. I will surely do it.

832
00:54:02,269 --> 00:54:03,634
All the best!

833
00:54:12,779 --> 00:54:15,612
Sister, is this an injection? -
- Yes. For you to sleep.

834
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:18,377
No, sister.
- How can you say no?

835
00:54:18,518 --> 00:54:20,383
How long will you bear
the pain? - No, sister.

836
00:54:21,521 --> 00:54:23,648
No. it is time for him to come.

837
00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:27,419
How can I sleep without talking
a few words with him?

838
00:54:27,561 --> 00:54:29,586
What should he think of me?

839
00:54:30,731 --> 00:54:32,255
When you have tears due
to the unbearable pain..

840
00:54:32,399 --> 00:54:33,661
..how can you manage to
speak with a smile?

841
00:54:35,802 --> 00:54:36,791
You don't know, sister.

842
00:54:37,938 --> 00:54:42,432
If I look at his face I can
forget any amount of pain.

843
00:54:55,589 --> 00:54:57,784
Kamalu! Kamalu!

844
00:54:59,926 --> 00:55:01,621
Here you are?
- How are you?

845
00:55:01,762 --> 00:55:04,356
I'm fine. Have you
had your lunch?

846
00:55:04,498 --> 00:55:05,897
I have eaten and it
has digested too.

847
00:55:06,366 --> 00:55:08,300
Dr. subbu said that he will
start the new treatment..

848
00:55:08,435 --> 00:55:10,232
..from tomorrow and
that I can take..

849
00:55:10,370 --> 00:55:11,394
..you home in a month's time.

850
00:55:12,539 --> 00:55:14,234
As soon as we go back home..

851
00:55:14,374 --> 00:55:17,901
..we both can be
like we used to.

852
00:55:29,756 --> 00:55:34,750
"You are the tune and
you are the emotion."

853
00:55:41,668 --> 00:55:44,262
"Strum the strings of
the Veena in my heart..

854
00:55:44,404 --> 00:55:52,607
..and dance to it,
my pretty one."

855
00:55:53,747 --> 00:55:58,446
"Flower of love, my life
has been illuminated."

856
00:56:26,913 --> 00:56:29,746
Please ask them not to take
away my belongings.

857
00:56:30,050 --> 00:56:34,146
Ask them not to. I will
repay the debts.

858
00:56:34,388 --> 00:56:35,582
Is it Baddi Basavvanna's
troubles?

859
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:37,584
Did you have to take a loan..

860
00:56:37,724 --> 00:56:38,713
..from him of all the people?

861
00:56:38,859 --> 00:56:40,724
It is all my ill luck!

862
00:56:41,395 --> 00:56:43,260
He has collected an interest..

863
00:56:43,397 --> 00:56:44,625
..of 7000 for a loan of 6000.

864
00:56:44,765 --> 00:56:46,255
He is still asking for
more interest and..

865
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,924
..is taking away all the
stuff in my house.

866
00:56:48,402 --> 00:56:49,767
He is such a tyrant.

867
00:56:49,903 --> 00:56:51,598
Mr. Lawyer why don't you tell
him that it is unlawful?

868
00:56:51,738 --> 00:56:53,933
How will he ever know
what is lawful?

869
00:56:54,674 --> 00:56:56,733
He has conned even a criminal
lawyer like me.

870
00:56:57,711 --> 00:57:00,441
Oh no! He is washing
away my house?

871
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:01,774
You sinner!

872
00:57:01,915 --> 00:57:03,348
Aunty, who is a sinner?
Are you taking about him?

873
00:57:04,484 --> 00:57:06,213
He is a noble soul
who has drowned..

874
00:57:06,353 --> 00:57:07,718
..so many houses like this.

875
00:57:08,355 --> 00:57:09,549
You tyrant!

876
00:57:09,689 --> 00:57:11,350
See how he is wiping it off.

877
00:57:11,491 --> 00:57:13,220
Aunty, however much
you spit on..

878
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:15,555
..him he will just brush
it off in the wind.

879
00:57:15,695 --> 00:57:17,219
Look at this old woman.
She has taken..

880
00:57:17,364 --> 00:57:19,457
..a debt from this bastard.

881
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:22,227
Lawyer, while you are at
it abuse me in chaste..

882
00:57:22,369 --> 00:57:24,894
..Kannada in front a few people.

883
00:57:25,372 --> 00:57:27,237
I too will slap a case
of defamation on..

884
00:57:27,374 --> 00:57:29,569
..you and make some
money out of it.

885
00:57:31,378 --> 00:57:32,572
See you then, aunty!

886
00:57:32,712 --> 00:57:35,613
Have faith! - I will. I will!
- keep it. Keep it!

887
00:57:38,685 --> 00:57:39,743
One big pot.

888
00:57:47,394 --> 00:57:49,589
Ranga, did you want a loan?

889
00:57:49,729 --> 00:57:51,720
Do you have the status
to give me a loan?

890
00:57:52,866 --> 00:57:54,731
I've come to throw my
aunty's loan amount.

891
00:57:56,603 --> 00:57:57,592
You are a cheat who couldn't..

892
00:57:57,737 --> 00:57:58,761
..pay up three month's rent.

893
00:57:58,905 --> 00:58:00,600
Can you repay that
old woman's loan?

894
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:09,342
Ranga! Are you all right?
Are you fine? - Sure!

895
00:58:09,483 --> 00:58:10,609
Why are you looking
at me like that?

896
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:14,550
Get a small cup of tea
for brother Ranga! Go!

897
00:58:15,689 --> 00:58:17,554
Why are you standing?
Please sit down.

898
00:58:17,691 --> 00:58:19,886
It is all right. Don't
take so much trouble.

899
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:22,355
That is your place you sit
there. I'll sit here.

900
00:58:25,499 --> 00:58:27,467
Why are looking at my face?
Count the money.

901
00:58:37,611 --> 00:58:39,579
Ranga, what are you doing?

902
00:58:39,713 --> 00:58:41,374
Nothing. I am just sitting here.

903
00:58:41,515 --> 00:58:42,914
I mean what do you do?

904
00:58:43,383 --> 00:58:45,374
Oh that! Antiques business.

905
00:58:45,519 --> 00:58:48,613
What is that?
- It means old stuff.

906
00:58:48,755 --> 00:58:50,245
That is I send old things
out of the country..

907
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:51,584
..and do business in that.

908
00:58:51,725 --> 00:58:56,628
How is that?
- What does this cost?

909
00:58:57,397 --> 00:59:00,423
Must be 2-3 Rs. - Your head.
It would cost 20,000 Rs!

910
00:59:01,568 --> 00:59:03,832
Robert Clive used to
eat beef with this.

911
00:59:05,572 --> 00:59:06,766
Do you know what this is?

912
00:59:06,907 --> 00:59:08,898
It is the nutcracker used
by Krishnadevaraya.

913
00:59:09,576 --> 00:59:11,100
Do you know what this is?

914
00:59:11,578 --> 00:59:13,569
The queen used to have
Dosa served on it.

915
00:59:13,713 --> 00:59:15,442
If we say such things
to foreigners they..

916
00:59:15,582 --> 00:59:17,914
..will buy it even
for a lakh rupees.

917
00:59:18,051 --> 00:59:19,643
That is the business I am doing.

918
00:59:20,587 --> 00:59:21,781
Bye. It is getting late.

919
00:59:21,922 --> 00:59:22,911
I have to have the
house repaired.

920
00:59:23,056 --> 00:59:24,114
What house?
- My house.

921
00:59:24,591 --> 00:59:25,683
Your house? -
- Yes.

922
00:59:25,825 --> 00:59:28,589
I have bought my aunty's house.
- At what price?

923
00:59:28,728 --> 00:59:30,593
For 40,000 Rs.
- You fool!

924
00:59:30,730 --> 00:59:32,459
You have paid 40,000
for that house..

925
00:59:32,599 --> 00:59:35,864
..that is not worth
more than 15,000 Rs.

926
00:59:36,002 --> 00:59:37,469
You fool! When these broken
things are worth..

927
00:59:37,604 --> 00:59:39,629
..so many crores just think
about how many such..

928
00:59:39,773 --> 00:59:43,641
..things will be there
in that house!

929
00:59:43,777 --> 00:59:45,142
And look.

930
00:59:45,612 --> 00:59:47,477
Aunty told me that there
are some very valuable..

931
00:59:47,614 --> 00:59:48,945
..documents in these boxes.

932
00:59:49,082 --> 00:59:50,481
Even if anything thing goes..

933
00:59:50,617 --> 00:59:51,641
..missing you will have
to come to the court.

934
00:59:51,785 --> 00:59:53,844
Be careful. Bring it
back carefully. Bye.

935
00:59:53,987 --> 00:59:55,614
Bye. Bye!

936
01:00:35,595 --> 01:00:37,961
This is where the treasure is.

937
01:00:46,106 --> 01:00:47,971
Aunty! Aunty! Come here.

938
01:00:51,111 --> 01:00:52,806
Bring everything and keep
it carefully inside.

939
01:00:54,948 --> 01:00:56,813
Aunty, don't you have
to be more responsible?

940
01:00:57,617 --> 01:00:59,482
Should you keep
such a valuable..

941
01:00:59,619 --> 01:01:00,608
..paper is that broken box?

942
01:01:00,754 --> 01:01:02,813
What paper?
- Just keep quiet.

943
01:01:02,956 --> 01:01:04,548
What do you mean by what paper?

944
01:01:05,692 --> 01:01:06,920
As it is he is greedy for money.

945
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:08,425
He won't stop short
of licking money..

946
01:01:08,561 --> 01:01:09,755
..that is fallen on garbage.

947
01:01:11,564 --> 01:01:12,826
I was just talking about you.

948
01:01:12,966 --> 01:01:13,955
Sinners will live long.

949
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:15,431
After getting what
is due to me why..

950
01:01:15,568 --> 01:01:17,559
..do I need other
people's property?

951
01:01:18,705 --> 01:01:22,607
Rangu, how much did you
buy this house for?

952
01:01:23,576 --> 01:01:24,770
40000 Rs.

953
01:01:25,912 --> 01:01:27,106
My clerk Gundanna,
is a poor man.

954
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:31,107
He has a big family. He
will be indebted to you.

955
01:01:31,584 --> 01:01:33,108
Why don't you give
this house to him?

956
01:01:33,586 --> 01:01:35,781
For free?
- Would I ever say that?

957
01:01:36,923 --> 01:01:38,117
For purchase. How much
will you give me?

958
01:01:38,892 --> 01:01:43,625
25,000. - 25,000!
have paid 40,000 Rs.

959
01:01:43,763 --> 01:01:45,594
And you want it for 25,000.

960
01:01:45,732 --> 01:01:47,666
Will your grandpa come
and pay the 15000?

961
01:01:48,802 --> 01:01:51,600
30?
- Just get up! Get up!

962
01:01:52,739 --> 01:01:54,934
40!
- Get out.

963
01:01:56,609 --> 01:01:57,871
50?
- I said out of here.

964
01:01:58,011 --> 01:01:59,706
60?
- Out of the gate.

965
01:01:59,846 --> 01:02:02,815
70?
- Give it to me. Give it.

966
01:02:06,886 --> 01:02:08,547
Here.
- How much?

967
01:02:08,688 --> 01:02:10,656
10,000.00
- What about the balance amount?

968
01:02:10,790 --> 01:02:11,916
I'll give it to you.
- Give it.

969
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:14,083
I'll give it to you.
- Just give it, man.

970
01:02:14,561 --> 01:02:16,552
But you must vacate the
house immediately!

971
01:02:16,696 --> 01:02:18,095
You must give the
money immediately!

972
01:02:19,566 --> 01:02:20,897
I have to go and get
it from the house.

973
01:02:21,034 --> 01:02:22,592
Go and fetch it, man.

974
01:02:28,842 --> 01:02:32,801
I won't. I'll stay here
and give you a pro note.

975
01:02:32,946 --> 01:02:36,780
Pro note. Good. Do that.

976
01:02:39,919 --> 01:02:41,113
When did you learn to sign?

977
01:02:45,592 --> 01:02:46,684
Is it done?

978
01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:48,786
I think this is the first
time you are signing..

979
01:02:48,928 --> 01:02:50,122
..a note for another
someone else.

980
01:02:50,597 --> 01:02:51,962
All for Gundanna's sake.

981
01:02:52,098 --> 01:02:53,588
Have you put aunty's signature
on it already?

982
01:02:53,733 --> 01:02:54,961
Yes, I have.

983
01:02:55,602 --> 01:02:57,695
Aunty! Come on,. Come Aunty!

984
01:03:01,841 --> 01:03:03,536
Why are you leaving all
your stuff behind?

985
01:03:04,677 --> 01:03:06,076
All for Gundanna's sake.

986
01:03:08,848 --> 01:03:09,872
I suspected something when..

987
01:03:10,016 --> 01:03:11,005
..he asked for money
the other day.

988
01:03:11,151 --> 01:03:13,085
Not 10, not 100 and not 1000.

989
01:03:13,553 --> 01:03:15,544
I gave him 10,000 Rs.
going by what you said.

990
01:03:15,688 --> 01:03:16,746
That was the last I saw of him.

991
01:03:16,890 --> 01:03:17,914
He hasn't come back
here after that day.

992
01:03:18,057 --> 01:03:19,081
What do I do now?

993
01:03:19,559 --> 01:03:22,551
He is not like that. He
is a very nice man.

994
01:03:22,695 --> 01:03:24,094
Just shut up! As if
you know everything.

995
01:03:24,831 --> 01:03:26,423
If he was that good wouldn't..

996
01:03:26,566 --> 01:03:27,590
..he have at least
made a phone call?

997
01:03:27,734 --> 01:03:30,794
All are cheats! If they
get free money..

998
01:03:36,943 --> 01:03:38,808
Come here, my dear. Come.

999
01:03:40,947 --> 01:03:42,812
Here aunty Shantamma. Your
10,000 Rs. count it.

1000
01:03:43,883 --> 01:03:47,683
Look what I said was right.
You spoke in haste.

1001
01:03:48,822 --> 01:03:49,789
Bye then.

1002
01:03:49,923 --> 01:03:51,823
I didn't say it purposely.

1003
01:03:51,958 --> 01:03:53,448
Since you didn't come back..

1004
01:03:53,593 --> 01:03:54,719
..for so many days I was upset.

1005
01:03:54,861 --> 01:03:56,123
Let this money stay with you.

1006
01:03:56,596 --> 01:03:57,688
It is all right Aunty Shantamma.

1007
01:03:57,831 --> 01:03:59,458
I took the money from
you for some reason..

1008
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:01,794
..now I am just returning
it to you.

1009
01:04:01,935 --> 01:04:02,959
Bye then see you.

1010
01:04:07,707 --> 01:04:09,971
Mr. Ranga, one minute.

1011
01:04:12,712 --> 01:04:13,974
My mother is always like that.

1012
01:04:14,113 --> 01:04:15,705
She doesn't know
what she speaks.

1013
01:04:15,849 --> 01:04:20,081
Please don't forget me
in your anger for her.

1014
01:04:21,988 --> 01:04:23,580
I saw you under..

1015
01:04:23,723 --> 01:04:24,815
..unforgettable circumstances.

1016
01:04:25,959 --> 01:04:28,052
How can I forget you? See you.

1017
01:04:56,756 --> 01:04:59,748
Hey! Who is digging the ground?

1018
01:05:01,895 --> 01:05:05,160
Oh no! It is Baddi Basavanna!

1019
01:05:05,698 --> 01:05:07,723
Why are you digging all alone?

1020
01:05:07,867 --> 01:05:08,891
Are you digging for
the foundation..

1021
01:05:09,035 --> 01:05:10,059
..of the new house?

1022
01:05:10,203 --> 01:05:12,694
Hey! Come here. Come inside!

1023
01:05:12,839 --> 01:05:14,704
Yes. I am coming.

1024
01:05:19,846 --> 01:05:21,711
Come. Come.

1025
01:05:25,985 --> 01:05:27,816
What a state you are in?
Wearing briefs!

1026
01:05:27,954 --> 01:05:29,945
You cheat! Where is it?
Where is the treasure?

1027
01:05:30,723 --> 01:05:31,917
What treasure? Where is it?

1028
01:05:32,058 --> 01:05:33,719
You said there was
treasure here.

1029
01:05:34,861 --> 01:05:36,590
Here. I believed that there
is treasure here..

1030
01:05:36,729 --> 01:05:37,991
..and bought this house
for 70,000 Rs.

1031
01:05:39,132 --> 01:05:42,932
Who told you that? Aunty,
did you tell him so? - No.

1032
01:05:43,069 --> 01:05:44,593
Would I borrow money from
this vulture had l..

1033
01:05:44,737 --> 01:05:45,931
..known that there was
a treasure here?

1034
01:05:46,739 --> 01:05:47,933
I don't know all that.

1035
01:05:48,074 --> 01:05:50,907
Give me my money and
take back your house.

1036
01:05:51,044 --> 01:05:52,944
I'll thrash the hell out of
you and you will vomit.

1037
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:55,980
You have made a gaping
hole here like a boar.

1038
01:05:56,749 --> 01:05:57,943
Who told you?

1039
01:05:58,084 --> 01:05:59,073
Did I tell you that there
is a treasure here?

1040
01:05:59,218 --> 01:06:02,779
You better give us the
60,000 you owe us.

1041
01:06:02,922 --> 01:06:04,685
I won't give it.
What will you do?

1042
01:06:04,824 --> 01:06:06,917
Remember the pro note
that you have written?

1043
01:06:07,994 --> 01:06:09,689
It will go to the court. Your
father will come down.

1044
01:06:09,829 --> 01:06:11,057
Lawyer, Subbu Raya!!

1045
01:06:11,698 --> 01:06:12,892
You cheat!

1046
01:06:13,032 --> 01:06:15,694
You keep this house and
keep the money too.

1047
01:06:15,835 --> 01:06:17,700
May you be ruined!
May you be ruined!

1048
01:06:17,837 --> 01:06:19,702
Basavva with briefs! Hey!

1049
01:06:29,849 --> 01:06:32,716
Mr. Ranga! Ranga! Ranga!

1050
01:06:35,855 --> 01:06:37,083
I have been searching
for you for two days.

1051
01:06:37,223 --> 01:06:38,713
Why?
- Just to meet you.

1052
01:06:40,860 --> 01:06:43,260
Are you coming from a
medical shop? -- Yes.

1053
01:06:43,730 --> 01:06:47,928
Who is the medicine for?
- For me.

1054
01:06:49,068 --> 01:06:50,968
Are you unwell?
- Not like that.

1055
01:06:51,738 --> 01:06:53,729
Do you have fever?
- Not at all.

1056
01:06:53,873 --> 01:06:55,101
Then what is the matter?

1057
01:06:55,241 --> 01:06:56,606
I don't know why I have
lost my appetite..

1058
01:06:56,743 --> 01:06:59,735
..all of a sudden and
I don't sleep well.

1059
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:04,748
When I go to sleep
I have nightmares.

1060
01:07:04,884 --> 01:07:05,873
What kind of dream?

1061
01:07:09,022 --> 01:07:14,221
A lonely place. There
is no one there.

1062
01:07:15,962 --> 01:07:18,055
A woman who means
the life to me.

1063
01:07:19,198 --> 01:07:20,563
Four people wearing
black clothes..

1064
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:25,933
..are dragging her along.

1065
01:08:12,051 --> 01:08:14,212
It is so nice.
- What?

1066
01:08:14,687 --> 01:08:15,881
The dream you just
told me about.

1067
01:08:16,022 --> 01:08:18,217
I too dream the same
thing everyday.

1068
01:08:18,691 --> 01:08:20,682
Some rogues are chasing me.

1069
01:08:20,827 --> 01:08:24,228
And I am screaming for
help and running.

1070
01:09:07,907 --> 01:09:11,001
Looking at you brings
me so much pleasure.

1071
01:09:32,932 --> 01:09:34,126
Isn't your dream over yet?

1072
01:09:35,268 --> 01:09:37,930
Mr. Ranga, do you know
who it is? - Who?

1073
01:09:39,071 --> 01:09:40,936
The king of my dreams.
- Who is it?

1074
01:09:41,941 --> 01:09:43,135
It is you.

1075
01:09:57,957 --> 01:09:59,219
Dear, dear!

1076
01:10:00,359 --> 01:10:02,486
Kamalu, why are you
sitting here alone?

1077
01:10:02,962 --> 01:10:04,896
I was getting bored.
So I just sat here.

1078
01:10:05,031 --> 01:10:08,933
But why were you smiling
to yourself? What is it?

1079
01:10:10,069 --> 01:10:11,900
Why? Why? Why?

1080
01:10:16,909 --> 01:10:19,036
Now I know why Harishchandra
never told a lie.

1081
01:10:20,179 --> 01:10:22,773
If you tell one lie in
the spate of things..

1082
01:10:22,915 --> 01:10:24,940
..then you have
to weave a rope..

1083
01:10:25,084 --> 01:10:27,450
..of lies to protect
that one lie.

1084
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:29,444
Now what has happened?

1085
01:10:30,189 --> 01:10:32,157
There's a very rich
lady named Shantamma.

1086
01:10:32,291 --> 01:10:34,122
Say yes.
- Yes.

1087
01:10:34,260 --> 01:10:36,251
She has a daughter named Meena.

1088
01:10:36,929 --> 01:10:40,160
Is she a young girl or a lady?

1089
01:10:40,299 --> 01:10:42,130
You are disturbing me in
the middle of the story.

1090
01:10:42,268 --> 01:10:44,930
Why do you worry about all that?

1091
01:10:47,073 --> 01:10:48,472
Well she is a grown up lady.

1092
01:10:48,941 --> 01:10:51,068
Is the girl pretty?
- She is pretty.

1093
01:10:53,212 --> 01:10:54,304
Have you seen her? -
- Yes.

1094
01:10:55,448 --> 01:10:57,939
Tell me the truth.
How does she look?

1095
01:10:58,084 --> 01:11:00,143
Didn't I tell you already
that she is good looking?

1096
01:11:01,287 --> 01:11:02,948
Why bother about how
anyone else looks?

1097
01:11:03,089 --> 01:11:05,922
This is the only face that
looks pretty to these eyes.

1098
01:11:07,059 --> 01:11:09,152
I could keep listening
to you talk.

1099
01:11:09,895 --> 01:11:11,954
And then?
- Then?

1100
01:11:13,099 --> 01:11:16,125
Then what? - You were telling
me about that girl.

1101
01:11:17,270 --> 01:11:21,104
All right. I ended up telling
a lie to prove something.

1102
01:11:22,241 --> 01:11:24,903
I lied to Shantamma that
I am still unmarried.

1103
01:11:25,044 --> 01:11:26,272
And there started the trouble.

1104
01:11:29,415 --> 01:11:30,905
I understood everything.
- What did you understand?

1105
01:11:31,050 --> 01:11:35,111
That pretty grown up girl
has fallen for you.

1106
01:11:35,254 --> 01:11:36,278
Isn't that right?

1107
01:11:36,422 --> 01:11:37,912
How did you know this?

1108
01:11:38,057 --> 01:11:40,787
When a handsome guy like
you says that he is a..

1109
01:11:40,926 --> 01:11:45,192
..bachelor can any girl
resist desiring you?

1110
01:11:46,332 --> 01:11:47,924
Am I so handsome?

1111
01:11:49,068 --> 01:11:51,127
You are handsome. Your
talks are handsome.

1112
01:11:51,270 --> 01:11:53,135
Living with you is beautiful.

1113
01:11:53,272 --> 01:11:54,933
I am very lucky.

1114
01:11:55,074 --> 01:11:57,304
I am the lucky one because
I married you.

1115
01:11:58,444 --> 01:11:59,934
It was a very good idea to
take my wife to Bombay.

1116
01:12:00,079 --> 01:12:02,479
The Dr. Verma there
took good care of us.

1117
01:12:03,215 --> 01:12:04,876
Dr. Verma is the number
one expert in lndia.

1118
01:12:05,017 --> 01:12:06,746
You can understand how
great he is because..

1119
01:12:06,886 --> 01:12:08,911
..cancer patients
from around the..

1120
01:12:09,055 --> 01:12:10,147
..world come to
consult with him.

1121
01:12:10,289 --> 01:12:12,018
Thanks for your timely
suggestion.

1122
01:12:13,159 --> 01:12:15,423
Thank God my wife's life
was saved because of you.

1123
01:12:15,895 --> 01:12:17,089
What have we got to do with it?

1124
01:12:17,229 --> 01:12:18,253
It is all God's grace.

1125
01:12:18,397 --> 01:12:20,024
See you.
- Greetings to you.

1126
01:12:26,172 --> 01:12:27,901
Ranga, why are you
standing here?

1127
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:29,905
Where is that Dr. Verma
they were talking about?

1128
01:12:30,910 --> 01:12:32,104
He is in Bombay.

1129
01:12:32,244 --> 01:12:34,041
Why didn't you tell
me about him earlier?

1130
01:12:34,180 --> 01:12:35,442
What would you have done
even if I told you?

1131
01:12:35,915 --> 01:12:37,109
I could take Kamala there.

1132
01:12:38,250 --> 01:12:39,239
But you will have to
spend a lot of money.

1133
01:12:39,385 --> 01:12:40,374
Let it be.

1134
01:12:40,519 --> 01:12:41,918
Does money earn us or
do we earn money?

1135
01:12:43,055 --> 01:12:44,920
You should have told
me about it earlier.

1136
01:12:45,057 --> 01:12:46,285
You still haven't lost time.

1137
01:12:46,425 --> 01:12:47,858
If you assure me that you
will arrange for the..

1138
01:12:47,993 --> 01:12:49,790
..money I will call
Bombay right away..

1139
01:12:49,929 --> 01:12:50,918
..and fix an appointment
for you.

1140
01:12:51,063 --> 01:12:52,189
You can take your
wife to Bombay.

1141
01:12:52,932 --> 01:12:55,332
Then call immediately. Please.
- Shall l?

1142
01:13:31,437 --> 01:13:33,166
Hey! Prahalada! Is that
you? Are you hurt?

1143
01:13:33,305 --> 01:13:35,102
No, sir. Not at all.
I'm very sorry, sir.

1144
01:13:35,241 --> 01:13:36,265
Is this any way to
ride a scooter?

1145
01:13:36,909 --> 01:13:38,274
Sir, the brake is out of order.

1146
01:13:38,411 --> 01:13:42,142
How would you be able
to jam the brakes?

1147
01:13:43,282 --> 01:13:46,274
Please don't tell about
this at my home?

1148
01:13:46,419 --> 01:13:48,910
What about? About your running
the scooter over me?

1149
01:13:49,054 --> 01:13:50,919
No sir. This girl..
- Who is this girl?

1150
01:13:51,056 --> 01:13:53,786
I am in love with this girl..

1151
01:13:53,926 --> 01:13:58,124
- Are you in love
with this girl?

1152
01:13:58,264 --> 01:13:59,253
Yes, sir.

1153
01:13:59,398 --> 01:14:02,390
What about you, dear? I
have to understand this.

1154
01:14:03,636 --> 01:14:08,232
Sir, if my mother finds about
this she will finish me.

1155
01:14:08,374 --> 01:14:09,568
On what basis did you
fall in love with her?

1156
01:14:10,042 --> 01:14:11,236
Somehow I have fallen in love.

1157
01:14:11,377 --> 01:14:13,038
I don't like all this. You
both should get married.

1158
01:14:13,179 --> 01:14:14,407
You must live like man and wife.

1159
01:14:15,047 --> 01:14:17,038
In that case get
us married, sir.

1160
01:14:17,183 --> 01:14:19,583
I just gave you the idea
and you are after me.

1161
01:14:21,053 --> 01:14:22,418
Do you think I am a priest?

1162
01:14:26,058 --> 01:14:28,049
Ok. Ok. All right.

1163
01:14:29,195 --> 01:14:31,060
I want to know all about
you two correctly.

1164
01:14:32,198 --> 01:14:34,063
I am Gopala raya.
What is the matter?

1165
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:37,601
Your daughter loves a boy.
- Let her go ahead.

1166
01:14:38,370 --> 01:14:40,065
Don't you have to
get her married?

1167
01:14:40,206 --> 01:14:42,071
That can be done what
is your hurry about it?

1168
01:14:42,208 --> 01:14:43,436
I have assured her that
I will do it for them.

1169
01:14:43,576 --> 01:14:46,306
How can you do it when
I am the girl's father?

1170
01:14:46,445 --> 01:14:49,073
How can you do it?
- How can you do it?

1171
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:51,274
How can you do it?
- How can you do it?

1172
01:14:51,417 --> 01:14:53,078
How can you do it?
- How can you do it?

1173
01:14:53,219 --> 01:14:54,948
Don't I have a big bungalow,
a car..

1174
01:14:55,087 --> 01:14:59,319
..and loads of wealth
and status?

1175
01:14:59,458 --> 01:15:01,289
Along with it you have
a load of debts too.

1176
01:15:02,094 --> 01:15:04,028
Am I in debt? Who the
hell told you that?

1177
01:15:05,164 --> 01:15:07,029
The guy who gave you the loan.

1178
01:15:08,167 --> 01:15:11,068
The value of the house is 4
lakhs and the loan is 6 lakhs.

1179
01:15:11,203 --> 01:15:12,898
The value of the car is loan..

1180
01:15:13,038 --> 01:15:14,403
..70000 but the
loan is for 8000.

1181
01:15:14,540 --> 01:15:15,905
The value of the watch is 2000..

1182
01:15:16,041 --> 01:15:18,032
..and the loan is of 4000.

1183
01:15:18,177 --> 01:15:19,235
When you have to see your..

1184
01:15:19,378 --> 01:15:20,402
..worth it won't be for
more that 3 paise.

1185
01:15:20,546 --> 01:15:22,241
But there is no dearth
for tall talking.

1186
01:15:24,383 --> 01:15:25,907
Would you like some coffee..

1187
01:15:26,051 --> 01:15:27,245
..or some almonds and milk?

1188
01:15:27,386 --> 01:15:29,047
What did you say?
- I made a mistake.

1189
01:15:29,188 --> 01:15:30,917
I mean to say that don't strip..

1190
01:15:31,056 --> 01:15:32,284
..me off all my esteem outside.

1191
01:15:32,424 --> 01:15:33,584
Are you asking me
to do it inside?

1192
01:15:34,059 --> 01:15:35,321
Please come.

1193
01:15:36,462 --> 01:15:38,293
What is this dance?
- Please come. Please come.

1194
01:15:44,436 --> 01:15:46,267
Sit here. Sit here.
- Thank you.

1195
01:15:46,405 --> 01:15:47,929
Now we can talk in peace.

1196
01:15:48,073 --> 01:15:50,064
That's the way to go.
- Here I come.

1197
01:15:51,210 --> 01:15:52,939
Do you know the guy whom..

1198
01:15:53,078 --> 01:15:54,272
..your daughter wants to marry?

1199
01:15:54,413 --> 01:15:55,437
Who?
- Me.

1200
01:15:56,081 --> 01:15:59,312
Will you believe me?

1201
01:16:00,452 --> 01:16:03,080
Tell me. - Do you Know the
rich lady Shantamma?

1202
01:16:03,222 --> 01:16:06,020
Yes, yes.
- The boy is her son Prahalada.

1203
01:16:07,159 --> 01:16:09,559
Shantamma's son?
There is no use.

1204
01:16:10,296 --> 01:16:13,231
Even if you and I fall at
her feet this won't happen.

1205
01:16:14,033 --> 01:16:15,227
Why?

1206
01:16:15,367 --> 01:16:16,891
Because just like you she also..

1207
01:16:17,036 --> 01:16:18,401
..has a list of my famous deeds.

1208
01:16:19,038 --> 01:16:21,131
You are world famous aren't you?

1209
01:16:22,274 --> 01:16:24,242
Let it be, leave
this worry to me.

1210
01:16:24,376 --> 01:16:26,571
I will fix this
alliance for you.

1211
01:16:27,046 --> 01:16:29,037
For that you will have
to give me 20000 Rs.

1212
01:16:29,181 --> 01:16:30,273
Can you do that?

1213
01:16:30,416 --> 01:16:32,577
Ok. 20000 Rs. Cash.

1214
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:36,049
In that case give me
5000 Rs. Advance.

1215
01:16:36,188 --> 01:16:37,917
Even if you caught hold of my..

1216
01:16:38,057 --> 01:16:39,251
..neck you will not
get even 1000 Rs.

1217
01:16:39,391 --> 01:16:41,120
Somehow arrange for this
marriage to take place.

1218
01:16:41,260 --> 01:16:45,196
As soon as the knot is tied
you will have the money.

1219
01:16:46,065 --> 01:16:47,930
What if you cheat me as soon..

1220
01:16:48,067 --> 01:16:50,058
..as your daughter is married?

1221
01:16:50,202 --> 01:16:51,601
How can I do that?

1222
01:16:52,071 --> 01:16:53,936
For a man who is deep in
debts it is a big deal..

1223
01:16:54,073 --> 01:16:56,132
..to get Shantamma as a kinsman.

1224
01:16:56,275 --> 01:16:58,436
After that lakhs
will be nothing.

1225
01:17:00,079 --> 01:17:02,604
Mr. Gopala.
- Wait a minute.

1226
01:17:05,017 --> 01:17:06,211
Mr. Gopala.

1227
01:17:13,359 --> 01:17:15,020
This is the RC book of my car.

1228
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:16,559
Keep it with you for a while.

1229
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,399
Are you here finally?

1230
01:17:23,035 --> 01:17:24,161
You haven't come for many days.

1231
01:17:24,303 --> 01:17:26,100
Finally you have come.
How are you?

1232
01:17:26,238 --> 01:17:29,139
Mr. Gopala, I won't be carried
away by what you say.

1233
01:17:29,274 --> 01:17:30,298
Just return the
money I gave you.

1234
01:17:30,442 --> 01:17:32,273
Or else I will take
away the car.

1235
01:17:32,411 --> 01:17:34,038
You are late. You are late. -
Couldn't you come a little earlier?

1236
01:17:34,179 --> 01:17:38,081
I just sold this car. He has
given the ABC certificate.

1237
01:17:38,217 --> 01:17:39,309
Now here is the key.

1238
01:17:41,053 --> 01:17:43,044
How many times will you
sell the same car?

1239
01:17:43,188 --> 01:17:45,315
I have sold the four
tyres to four people.

1240
01:17:45,457 --> 01:17:46,583
I didn't get anyone for the
Stepney.

1241
01:17:47,326 --> 01:17:49,055
You cheat! Do you have
any self respect?

1242
01:17:49,194 --> 01:17:50,320
Now you know I don't.

1243
01:17:50,462 --> 01:17:52,054
Hey guys, get into the house
take out all his stuff

1244
01:17:52,197 --> 01:17:54,290
Wait a little. Wait a little.
- Get inside the house.

1245
01:17:56,435 --> 01:17:57,424
Mr. Gopala, where
are you running to?

1246
01:17:58,070 --> 01:18:00,300
You cheat! You 420!
Open the door.

1247
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:03,408
I'll take you to the court.

1248
01:18:09,548 --> 01:18:12,244
Aunty Shantamma!
Aunty Shantamma!

1249
01:18:12,384 --> 01:18:13,373
What is it?

1250
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:16,044
Are you here?
- What is it?

1251
01:18:18,190 --> 01:18:20,021
Come with me. I won't
tell you that now.

1252
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:21,148
It is dangerous.

1253
01:18:22,628 --> 01:18:26,223
When I was studying in college
I did the same thing.

1254
01:18:31,370 --> 01:18:33,304
Hold on to him tight! Tighter!

1255
01:18:35,441 --> 01:18:37,033
My leg.
- come soon, sir.

1256
01:18:39,178 --> 01:18:41,043
Please let me go.
- I won't even if I die.

1257
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:42,306
Father! Father!

1258
01:18:42,448 --> 01:18:43,437
Please let me go, Sir.
- I won't!

1259
01:18:43,582 --> 01:18:44,913
Did you think of running away..

1260
01:18:45,050 --> 01:18:46,312
..after breaking my
daughter's leg?

1261
01:18:46,452 --> 01:18:47,919
Beat him up so badly that
his bones shouldn't join..

1262
01:18:48,053 --> 01:18:50,578
..even if plastered. Break it!

1263
01:18:53,358 --> 01:18:55,053
How dare you have my
son's leg broken?

1264
01:18:55,194 --> 01:18:56,320
Go, dear.

1265
01:18:56,462 --> 01:18:57,429
Go and file a complaint
in the police station.

1266
01:18:57,563 --> 01:19:00,589
Police? Yes. The phone is there.

1267
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:04,335
Yes, the phone is there.
What is the number?

1268
01:19:04,470 --> 01:19:06,597
Break both his legs before
the police come.

1269
01:19:06,739 --> 01:19:08,229
What will the police do after
the legs are broken?

1270
01:19:08,373 --> 01:19:10,238
Mother, my legs!

1271
01:19:11,243 --> 01:19:12,608
You broke my daughter's leg.

1272
01:19:13,245 --> 01:19:16,271
Tit for tat. And eye for eye.
A tooth for a tooth!

1273
01:19:16,415 --> 01:19:17,439
Isn't the list going too long?

1274
01:19:17,583 --> 01:19:18,777
Please console yourself.

1275
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:24,488
Father my leg is gone.
Who will marry me now?

1276
01:19:25,557 --> 01:19:27,252
I will marry you, Tara.
- Shut your mouth.

1277
01:19:27,392 --> 01:19:28,450
Just shut up a little.

1278
01:19:28,594 --> 01:19:30,118
Mother it was I who ran over..

1279
01:19:30,262 --> 01:19:31,456
..her leg with the scooter.

1280
01:19:31,597 --> 01:19:33,258
So? - Do you mean to say that
you will marry this lame girl?

1281
01:19:33,398 --> 01:19:34,456
Can he marry a lame girl?

1282
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:35,624
If he doesn't then will
I let go off him?

1283
01:19:35,768 --> 01:19:37,258
What the hell will you do?

1284
01:19:37,402 --> 01:19:38,801
I will have his legs broken!

1285
01:19:39,271 --> 01:19:40,533
Mother!
- Mara! Baira!

1286
01:19:40,672 --> 01:19:41,661
Please wait a little.
- Not possible.

1287
01:19:41,807 --> 01:19:45,299
A lakh! It is possible only
if you give me 1 lakh Rs.

1288
01:19:46,445 --> 01:19:47,469
Mother.

1289
01:19:47,613 --> 01:19:49,274
Hanumantha raya. Sorry
Gopala raya.

1290
01:19:49,414 --> 01:19:50,608
Will come here for a minute?

1291
01:19:56,288 --> 01:19:58,313
What is this about a lakh Rs?

1292
01:19:58,457 --> 01:19:59,549
Lakh of rupees..

1293
01:19:59,691 --> 01:20:01,682
Compensation for breaking
my daughter's leg.

1294
01:20:02,294 --> 01:20:04,228
Why not make use of the
money that comes easily?

1295
01:20:04,363 --> 01:20:06,092
How much should we
pay if someone..

1296
01:20:06,231 --> 01:20:08,290
..really broke your leg?
- Joke.

1297
01:20:10,169 --> 01:20:12,228
As if you are paying
it from your pocket.

1298
01:20:12,371 --> 01:20:13,599
It is the old hag's money.
Let it come.

1299
01:20:13,739 --> 01:20:15,570
As if you are a young man.

1300
01:20:16,241 --> 01:20:18,232
That's impossible. Are
you playing games?

1301
01:20:18,377 --> 01:20:19,503
Are you joking?

1302
01:20:19,645 --> 01:20:23,581
I can give a little
money to you too.

1303
01:20:23,715 --> 01:20:24,704
Just shut up! What did I say?

1304
01:20:24,850 --> 01:20:26,249
That I will get your
daughter married.

1305
01:20:26,385 --> 01:20:27,613
And what are you saying?

1306
01:20:28,754 --> 01:20:30,346
You are asking me to
indulge in blackmail.

1307
01:20:31,490 --> 01:20:33,117
If I just tell her that
all this is a spoof..

1308
01:20:33,258 --> 01:20:36,489
..then you won't
be in this house.

1309
01:20:36,628 --> 01:20:38,255
You will end up in the lockup.
Remember that!

1310
01:20:40,399 --> 01:20:43,527
I simply said all that.
I don't want any money.

1311
01:20:43,669 --> 01:20:45,466
Just get my daughter married.
That's all.

1312
01:20:46,271 --> 01:20:47,465
Come along then.

1313
01:20:52,611 --> 01:20:55,478
Aunty Shantamma! This
is bad situation.

1314
01:20:56,615 --> 01:20:58,276
He is furious about his
daughter's broken leg.

1315
01:20:58,417 --> 01:20:59,645
The mistake is on
your son's part.

1316
01:20:59,785 --> 01:21:01,150
Are you going to make
that girl your....

1317
01:21:01,286 --> 01:21:03,151
..daughter-in-law or are you
going to make your son..

1318
01:21:03,288 --> 01:21:05,449
..Iimp after having his
legs broken by the goons?

1319
01:21:05,591 --> 01:21:07,752
Don't! I beg of you.
Don't break my legs.

1320
01:21:08,527 --> 01:21:10,495
I will marry that girl.
- Are you telling the truth?

1321
01:21:10,629 --> 01:21:14,258
Yes, mother. I am telling
the truth. Tara is my wife.

1322
01:21:14,399 --> 01:21:15,593
Tara is your daughter-in-law!

1323
01:21:15,734 --> 01:21:17,224
Tara!
- Prahalad!

1324
01:21:17,836 --> 01:21:19,235
Tara!
- Prahalad!

1325
01:21:19,371 --> 01:21:20,497
Tara!
- Prahalad!

1326
01:21:20,639 --> 01:21:22,766
Go to hell! Do what
ever you please!

1327
01:21:24,243 --> 01:21:26,234
Tara!
- Prahalad!

1328
01:21:26,378 --> 01:21:27,504
Blow the bugle!

1329
01:21:57,276 --> 01:21:59,540
Welcome! Please come.

1330
01:22:00,279 --> 01:22:02,144
Couldn't we have got them..

1331
01:22:02,281 --> 01:22:04,306
..married after the
girl's leg heals?

1332
01:22:04,449 --> 01:22:05,416
If the leg heals the marriage..

1333
01:22:05,550 --> 01:22:06,539
..would never take place.

1334
01:22:07,686 --> 01:22:08,744
Would you have change for 10 Rs?

1335
01:22:09,488 --> 01:22:11,217
Don't have much to do with him.

1336
01:22:11,356 --> 01:22:12,482
He is very dangerous.

1337
01:22:12,624 --> 01:22:14,216
Please indulge in pettiness
after wards.

1338
01:22:15,227 --> 01:22:17,752
Greetings, please come.
Where is your father?

1339
01:22:50,262 --> 01:22:51,456
Please come here a minute.

1340
01:22:53,598 --> 01:22:55,589
Please have lunch
before you leave.

1341
01:22:55,734 --> 01:22:57,463
That's ok. First give
me the 20,000 Rs.

1342
01:22:57,602 --> 01:22:58,626
I have to leave.

1343
01:22:58,770 --> 01:23:00,465
20,000 Rs? What for?

1344
01:23:02,607 --> 01:23:04,074
The money you said
you'll get me..

1345
01:23:04,209 --> 01:23:05,471
..if I get your
daughter married.

1346
01:23:07,612 --> 01:23:09,079
Get going. I haven't
paid a penny..

1347
01:23:09,214 --> 01:23:11,307
..to those who have lent
me lakhs of rupees.

1348
01:23:11,450 --> 01:23:12,474
Do you think I will
give you the money?

1349
01:23:13,618 --> 01:23:15,210
Do you think I am a fool?

1350
01:23:16,688 --> 01:23:18,212
Greetings! I'm coming.

1351
01:23:29,368 --> 01:23:31,427
Careful. Careful!

1352
01:23:32,237 --> 01:23:33,431
Greetings.
- Hello!

1353
01:23:33,572 --> 01:23:35,233
Hello, daddy.
- Careful, my dear.

1354
01:23:35,374 --> 01:23:37,239
Careful of your leg.

1355
01:23:40,379 --> 01:23:42,244
You have arranged
for the welcome.

1356
01:23:42,381 --> 01:23:43,780
Can you give me some change?
- Here you are.

1357
01:23:45,584 --> 01:23:47,711
Take it. You put one too.

1358
01:23:51,289 --> 01:23:52,517
Carefully.

1359
01:23:54,259 --> 01:23:55,658
Come, daddy!

1360
01:24:02,267 --> 01:24:04,360
Driver, start the car.

1361
01:24:08,373 --> 01:24:09,397
Why are you taking the car?

1362
01:24:09,541 --> 01:24:10,530
I bought it from the owner.

1363
01:24:10,675 --> 01:24:11,664
I am the owner of this car.

1364
01:24:11,810 --> 01:24:12,834
Don't lie. I have
paid Rangaswamy..

1365
01:24:12,978 --> 01:24:13,967
..the money and bought
it from him.

1366
01:24:14,379 --> 01:24:16,370
Look at the RC book. Driver!

1367
01:24:16,515 --> 01:24:17,777
Rangaswamy!

1368
01:24:23,388 --> 01:24:25,583
What is this cheating?

1369
01:24:26,725 --> 01:24:28,590
What is cheating?
- Selling my car.

1370
01:24:29,394 --> 01:24:30,759
That is not cheating.

1371
01:24:30,896 --> 01:24:32,261
You cheated me by saying
that you will give..

1372
01:24:32,397 --> 01:24:35,389
..me 20,000 Rs. after
the wedding.

1373
01:24:35,534 --> 01:24:37,263
So? How can you sell the car..

1374
01:24:37,402 --> 01:24:39,597
..worth 60000 for
the sake of 20000?

1375
01:24:39,738 --> 01:24:40,932
I don't do such things.

1376
01:24:41,406 --> 01:24:42,668
I sold it for 60000 Rs.

1377
01:24:42,808 --> 01:24:46,266
Gave him the 35000 you owe
him took the 20000..

1378
01:24:46,411 --> 01:24:49,938
..I deserve and here is
the 5000 that remains.

1379
01:24:51,416 --> 01:24:52,940
Don't you need it? Will
you take it later?

1380
01:24:54,419 --> 01:24:56,614
Shall I give it you later? Bye!

1381
01:24:57,756 --> 01:24:59,417
Bye!
- Bye!

1382
01:25:14,506 --> 01:25:18,408
Kamalu, how are you?
- I am fine. How are you?

1383
01:25:18,543 --> 01:25:19,703
Absolutely first class.

1384
01:25:20,378 --> 01:25:21,902
Happy news.
- What is it?

1385
01:25:22,380 --> 01:25:24,245
First drink this hot milk then..

1386
01:25:24,382 --> 01:25:27,374
..I will tell you
the sweet news.

1387
01:25:31,523 --> 01:25:34,390
Next week you and l
are going to Bombay.

1388
01:25:35,527 --> 01:25:36,653
Why?
- For honeymoon.

1389
01:25:36,795 --> 01:25:38,660
Honeymoon?
- Why are you jealous?

1390
01:25:38,797 --> 01:25:40,662
Is it because your husband
won't take you?

1391
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:45,668
Any place I go to with Kamalu
is honeymoon for me.

1392
01:25:45,804 --> 01:25:48,602
Shut up! What is this
honeymoon now?

1393
01:25:49,741 --> 01:25:52,403
Every time there is a full
moon is a honeymoon.

1394
01:25:53,545 --> 01:25:55,274
I have to take you to Bombay..

1395
01:25:55,413 --> 01:25:56,744
..to Dr. Verma for treatment.

1396
01:25:57,883 --> 01:25:59,612
Dr. Verma? -
- Yes.

1397
01:26:01,753 --> 01:26:02,742
Why are you so surprised
about it?

1398
01:26:04,823 --> 01:26:05,812
Won't it cause a lot
of expenditure?

1399
01:26:05,957 --> 01:26:07,447
About 20000 Rs will
have to be spent.

1400
01:26:07,592 --> 01:26:10,891
That much.. what will you
do for that much money?

1401
01:26:11,363 --> 01:26:13,627
Why do you worry about that?
What do you think of me?

1402
01:26:15,767 --> 01:26:17,359
I am husband of the
goddess of wealth.

1403
01:26:17,502 --> 01:26:19,595
That is Lord Narayana! But
there is a difference.

1404
01:26:20,372 --> 01:26:22,237
In heaven Lord narayana
lies down and..

1405
01:26:22,374 --> 01:26:24,399
..his wife goddess laxmi
sits near his feet.

1406
01:26:24,543 --> 01:26:27,239
Here Goddess Laxmi
is lying down..

1407
01:26:27,379 --> 01:26:29,643
..and Lord Narayan is at
her feet serving her.

1408
01:26:29,781 --> 01:26:31,578
Oh no! Sit here!

1409
01:26:31,716 --> 01:26:36,585
"l saw you come up from
the sea of milk."

1410
01:26:36,721 --> 01:26:41,658
"l saw myself trap you in
the temple of my heart."

1411
01:26:43,795 --> 01:26:49,392
Kamalu! Kamalu! Why? Why?

1412
01:26:51,536 --> 01:26:53,265
You are serving me the way..

1413
01:26:53,405 --> 01:26:57,671
..I should have
been serving you.

1414
01:26:58,810 --> 01:27:01,608
Kamalu, are you different?

1415
01:27:02,747 --> 01:27:05,341
The soul is the same only
the bodies are different.

1416
01:27:05,483 --> 01:27:06,882
Do you disagree?

1417
01:27:19,364 --> 01:27:21,889
Kamala from Bangalore? -
- Yes.

1418
01:27:22,367 --> 01:27:23,891
Dr. Verma is calling you.

1419
01:27:29,641 --> 01:27:32,610
Greetings, sir. -
- Yes. Come in, come in.

1420
01:27:32,744 --> 01:27:33,733
Please sit down.

1421
01:27:36,648 --> 01:27:38,240
Mr. Ranga, I have
got the results..

1422
01:27:38,383 --> 01:27:39,577
..of the medical examinations
I did.

1423
01:27:39,718 --> 01:27:41,242
I have written a letter
to Dr. Subbu..

1424
01:27:41,386 --> 01:27:42,614
..to give treatment
according to that.

1425
01:27:44,756 --> 01:27:47,418
In a very few days Madam
Kamala will be fine.

1426
01:27:47,559 --> 01:27:49,720
You don't worry at all.
- Thank you, sir.

1427
01:27:50,862 --> 01:27:52,762
Before coming to Bombay
I was very scared.

1428
01:27:52,897 --> 01:27:54,387
You have done me a great favour.

1429
01:27:54,532 --> 01:27:55,590
After all it is my duty.

1430
01:27:55,734 --> 01:27:57,929
This is the least I can do for
someone from my own state.

1431
01:27:58,703 --> 01:28:01,672
Ask Dr. Subbu to contact me
often about her health.

1432
01:28:01,806 --> 01:28:03,398
I will tell him without
fail. Thank you.

1433
01:28:04,542 --> 01:28:06,339
Can we now leave for Bangalore?

1434
01:28:06,478 --> 01:28:08,537
Oh sure. All the best.
All the best to you.

1435
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:10,341
Thank you. Bye.

1436
01:28:32,370 --> 01:28:33,632
What is this?

1437
01:28:33,772 --> 01:28:35,467
Why should you do the
dishes and the clothes?

1438
01:28:35,607 --> 01:28:37,905
Why don't we find a person
to do all this?

1439
01:28:38,677 --> 01:28:40,508
Doing our own work brings
satisfaction.

1440
01:28:40,645 --> 01:28:44,604
Can we always rely on servants?

1441
01:28:50,755 --> 01:28:51,779
What are you doing?

1442
01:28:52,657 --> 01:28:55,717
In the world the best gift
is the gift of health.

1443
01:28:56,328 --> 01:28:58,262
In order to protect
that gift always..

1444
01:28:58,396 --> 01:28:59,658
..drink special
sweet lime juice.

1445
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:02,789
What is this advertisement?

1446
01:29:02,934 --> 01:29:04,094
I am making the juice.

1447
01:29:08,940 --> 01:29:12,603
Dear, come here. Who
washed the shirt?

1448
01:29:13,745 --> 01:29:15,110
Laundry.
- Which laundry?

1449
01:29:15,580 --> 01:29:17,775
Dum dum.
- Not Dum dum all rap rap!

1450
01:29:17,916 --> 01:29:19,850
What does that mean?

1451
01:29:19,984 --> 01:29:22,578
It means that you have washed
it yourself badly.

1452
01:29:23,588 --> 01:29:24,987
How did you find out?

1453
01:29:25,857 --> 01:29:27,688
Can't I make out on seeing this?

1454
01:29:27,826 --> 01:29:29,794
Didn't we discuss this before?

1455
01:29:30,595 --> 01:29:31,789
Our family won't
remain the same.

1456
01:29:31,930 --> 01:29:33,591
Expenses will increase.

1457
01:29:33,732 --> 01:29:35,700
Smart people must know
the value of money.

1458
01:29:35,834 --> 01:29:37,597
We must save every penny.

1459
01:29:38,737 --> 01:29:41,137
Now I have become very smart.

1460
01:29:43,608 --> 01:29:44,802
Why?

1461
01:29:44,943 --> 01:29:47,468
You are going to office,
cooking the food and..

1462
01:29:47,612 --> 01:29:52,879
..washing your own clothes.

1463
01:29:54,018 --> 01:29:57,977
Kamalu! Kamalu! Mad girl!

1464
01:29:58,123 --> 01:29:59,613
Why are you getting
upset about this?

1465
01:30:00,759 --> 01:30:03,694
Rightfully I should
be doing your chores.

1466
01:30:04,162 --> 01:30:07,620
My misfortune that I have
to make you serve me.

1467
01:30:08,566 --> 01:30:09,760
And I am still alive.

1468
01:30:09,901 --> 01:30:12,096
Don't dear, Kamalu! Don't
say such things, don't!

1469
01:30:12,937 --> 01:30:15,770
Who are you? You are
my better half.

1470
01:30:15,907 --> 01:30:17,431
When you and me are the same..

1471
01:30:17,575 --> 01:30:19,566
..what I am doing is for myself.

1472
01:30:20,712 --> 01:30:23,840
Isn't it? Come. Come, my dear.

1473
01:30:30,989 --> 01:30:32,957
Hey! What has happened to me?

1474
01:30:33,591 --> 01:30:34,785
What happened?

1475
01:30:34,926 --> 01:30:36,689
I forgot to give you
the sweet lime juice.

1476
01:30:56,848 --> 01:30:57,974
Tara! What are you doing?

1477
01:30:58,116 --> 01:30:59,606
What will be our plight
if my mother sees this?

1478
01:30:59,751 --> 01:31:00,877
Let her come.

1479
01:31:01,019 --> 01:31:02,008
Now that we are married
what is there to fear?

1480
01:31:02,153 --> 01:31:04,087
That is right too.

1481
01:31:18,069 --> 01:31:20,094
Oh no! Oh no! Cheating!
Injustice!

1482
01:31:20,572 --> 01:31:21,766
What is it, mother?

1483
01:31:21,906 --> 01:31:23,567
Leg, leg!
- What has happened to your leg?

1484
01:31:23,708 --> 01:31:24,834
Not my leg. Her leg.

1485
01:31:24,976 --> 01:31:26,773
Her legs seems fine to me.

1486
01:31:26,911 --> 01:31:28,105
That is what I am saying.

1487
01:31:28,580 --> 01:31:30,445
Hey you! You and your
father have..

1488
01:31:30,582 --> 01:31:32,607
..Iied to me that my son
broke your leg and..

1489
01:31:32,750 --> 01:31:34,775
..tricked me into letting
you come to this house.

1490
01:31:34,919 --> 01:31:36,682
Get out!
- Tara! Tara!

1491
01:31:36,821 --> 01:31:37,845
Get out!

1492
01:31:38,990 --> 01:31:41,584
Tara is my wife, mother.
We both are married.

1493
01:31:42,727 --> 01:31:43,853
Tara!

1494
01:31:44,996 --> 01:31:46,793
Aunty, leave my hand.
- Tara!

1495
01:31:48,933 --> 01:31:50,457
Old woman, how dare you push..

1496
01:31:50,602 --> 01:31:54,834
..my daughter out of my house?

1497
01:31:55,974 --> 01:32:00,843
This is my house!
- That was until yesterday.

1498
01:32:00,979 --> 01:32:02,606
Today it is my house.

1499
01:32:02,747 --> 01:32:03,907
Mr. bar at law!

1500
01:32:08,553 --> 01:32:10,077
Now make use of your power.

1501
01:32:17,562 --> 01:32:19,086
This is Marriage uncle's son.

1502
01:32:19,564 --> 01:32:21,828
Give respect. I am now a lawyer.

1503
01:32:22,567 --> 01:32:24,432
Mrs. Shantamma, your
son Prahalada has..

1504
01:32:24,569 --> 01:32:27,561
..written a power of attorney
for his father-in-law.

1505
01:32:27,705 --> 01:32:29,434
Look at this letter. From
now this property..

1506
01:32:29,574 --> 01:32:32,771
..and all the rights belong
to Gopala raya!

1507
01:32:33,912 --> 01:32:36,779
You idiot! What happened
to your brains?

1508
01:32:36,915 --> 01:32:38,815
What has this girl
done to your mind?

1509
01:32:40,585 --> 01:32:41,847
Shantamma, stop, stop, stop!

1510
01:32:41,986 --> 01:32:43,681
He may be just your son.

1511
01:32:43,821 --> 01:32:45,789
But he is son plus in-law to me.

1512
01:32:45,924 --> 01:32:46,948
You have no right to beat or..

1513
01:32:47,091 --> 01:32:48,080
..scold him according
to the law.

1514
01:32:48,593 --> 01:32:49,958
Bar at law? -
- Yes, yes.

1515
01:32:50,094 --> 01:32:51,459
Ranga, I thought that you are..

1516
01:32:51,596 --> 01:32:53,587
..a very intelligent person.

1517
01:32:53,731 --> 01:32:55,790
This Gopala has conned you too.

1518
01:32:56,601 --> 01:32:58,466
He tied a cloth around her
leg and said it was an..

1519
01:32:58,603 --> 01:32:59,831
..accident and has
got them married.

1520
01:32:59,971 --> 01:33:01,871
He is now trying to take away
all the property here.

1521
01:33:02,006 --> 01:33:06,966
Is it? Are you the lawyer? -
- Yes, I am.

1522
01:33:07,111 --> 01:33:08,669
Will you come over there
please? - Why not?

1523
01:33:14,819 --> 01:33:16,753
How much money has Gopala
promised you?

1524
01:33:18,890 --> 01:33:19,914
He said he will give it later.

1525
01:33:20,058 --> 01:33:21,548
He will show you an
empty hand later.

1526
01:33:21,693 --> 01:33:22,819
He will shave your head.

1527
01:33:29,567 --> 01:33:31,762
You are educated.

1528
01:33:31,903 --> 01:33:33,564
You said that you have
been top London.

1529
01:33:33,705 --> 01:33:34,831
Do you have any brains
in your head?

1530
01:33:34,973 --> 01:33:36,440
Why are you making a fool
of yourself joining..

1531
01:33:36,574 --> 01:33:38,633
..up with this useless
Gopala instead of..

1532
01:33:38,776 --> 01:33:40,607
..getting in touch with
people who have money..

1533
01:33:40,745 --> 01:33:41,837
..and make some money yourself?

1534
01:33:42,680 --> 01:33:44,580
No, no. The law has changed.

1535
01:33:45,717 --> 01:33:46,945
It has left me in the lurch.

1536
01:33:47,085 --> 01:33:48,575
Shantamma! Shantamma!

1537
01:33:50,722 --> 01:33:53,122
All the right of this
property is yours.

1538
01:33:54,592 --> 01:33:56,583
What about the power
of attorney?

1539
01:33:56,728 --> 01:33:59,595
The power is Shantamma's
the attorney is me.

1540
01:34:00,732 --> 01:34:02,597
You cheat! You cheat!

1541
01:34:02,734 --> 01:34:04,565
How can you change your
support from me to them..

1542
01:34:04,702 --> 01:34:06,897
..and cheat me at the
nick of the moment?

1543
01:34:07,038 --> 01:34:12,203
I am on the side that
will fetch me profit.

1544
01:34:12,710 --> 01:34:15,702
This bar at law is the
bird without sides.

1545
01:34:17,849 --> 01:34:20,044
Ranga, you are like Lord to me.

1546
01:34:20,718 --> 01:34:22,913
You just shattered the
trouble that came.

1547
01:34:27,058 --> 01:34:28,082
Daddy, what do we do now?

1548
01:34:28,259 --> 01:34:30,090
Mr. Gopala. What are
you still doing here?

1549
01:34:30,228 --> 01:34:32,719
What is all this chaos
you are creating?

1550
01:34:32,864 --> 01:34:34,092
That day the..
- Stop all that talk.

1551
01:34:34,732 --> 01:34:36,097
Just leave from here. I
am telling you decently.

1552
01:34:36,234 --> 01:34:38,828
I won't go. It is my
son-in-law's house.

1553
01:34:39,971 --> 01:34:44,738
Bar at law!
- What about my fees?

1554
01:34:44,876 --> 01:34:46,002
After you finish the work.

1555
01:34:48,146 --> 01:34:49,738
Mr. Gopala rao, you can go.
- No!

1556
01:34:49,881 --> 01:34:52,941
I am telling you politely.
Leave. - I won't leave.

1557
01:34:53,084 --> 01:34:57,987
Three, two one.
Get out! Get out!

1558
01:34:59,757 --> 01:35:02,021
Tara! Tara!

1559
01:35:04,696 --> 01:35:06,220
Why did you call me, sir?

1560
01:35:06,698 --> 01:35:07,892
Your wife has called.

1561
01:35:09,033 --> 01:35:10,227
Kamala what's the matter?
- Why have you called?

1562
01:35:10,702 --> 01:35:11,726
It is me. Meena.

1563
01:35:12,737 --> 01:35:15,706
How did you know I am here?

1564
01:35:16,841 --> 01:35:17,933
I saw you when you went inside.

1565
01:35:18,076 --> 01:35:19,976
You went inside before
I could talk to you.

1566
01:35:21,112 --> 01:35:22,704
I waited for you
for 1/2 an hour.

1567
01:35:22,847 --> 01:35:24,781
It doesn't seem like
you will come now.

1568
01:35:24,916 --> 01:35:26,577
That is why I am making
this call from the..

1569
01:35:26,718 --> 01:35:28,948
..telephone booth
near your office.

1570
01:35:29,087 --> 01:35:30,247
All right. Shall I hang up?

1571
01:35:30,988 --> 01:35:33,718
Will you come outside? -Oh no.
I can't leave until 5.

1572
01:35:33,858 --> 01:35:35,985
Hey! Are you a worker
in the office?

1573
01:35:36,127 --> 01:35:38,254
Why do you lie that you
can't leave until 5?

1574
01:35:39,030 --> 01:35:41,055
You don't know I have
some urgent work.

1575
01:35:41,733 --> 01:35:44,725
Please don't disturb me.
Please. Shall I hang up?

1576
01:35:45,870 --> 01:35:47,098
Ranga, why don't you go?

1577
01:35:47,739 --> 01:35:49,001
You don't know what the
urgency is about it.

1578
01:35:49,140 --> 01:35:50,129
You carry on.
- She..

1579
01:35:50,742 --> 01:35:52,175
I know everything.

1580
01:35:52,310 --> 01:35:53,937
Don't I know how loving
you both are?

1581
01:35:54,078 --> 01:35:56,069
Go. It is all right.

1582
01:35:56,214 --> 01:35:59,945
Sir..
- Ranga, go, go, go!!

1583
01:36:10,027 --> 01:36:12,894
What is the matter meena?
- Nothing.

1584
01:36:13,698 --> 01:36:15,222
Did you call me because
there is nothing?

1585
01:36:16,701 --> 01:36:17,895
Do you have your chit fund..

1586
01:36:18,035 --> 01:36:19,059
..members in this office too?

1587
01:36:19,203 --> 01:36:20,693
That is why I went there.

1588
01:36:20,838 --> 01:36:23,932
You said Kamala. Who is she?
What did you say?

1589
01:36:25,076 --> 01:36:26,976
I said that I have named
my life kamala!

1590
01:36:28,980 --> 01:36:30,914
Didn't she ask how your
life makes phone calls?

1591
01:36:31,048 --> 01:36:32,072
She did ask me.

1592
01:36:32,216 --> 01:36:33,581
Then I told her that my
life makes phone calls..

1593
01:36:33,718 --> 01:36:37,916
..and also hugs me when
I am sitting close to it.

1594
01:36:38,055 --> 01:36:39,579
And then I somehow cracked
jokes and made..

1595
01:36:39,724 --> 01:36:41,715
..fun and made her
forget that matter.

1596
01:36:42,860 --> 01:36:44,088
Poor thing. Looks
like a good girl.

1597
01:36:44,228 --> 01:36:45,718
How can you say that
she is a good girl?

1598
01:36:45,863 --> 01:36:48,093
Because she has believed
your lies and stories.

1599
01:36:48,232 --> 01:36:49,927
Don't think she is so simple.

1600
01:36:50,067 --> 01:36:51,329
She is very shrewd.

1601
01:36:52,036 --> 01:36:54,971
Am I shrewd? What have I done?

1602
01:36:56,040 --> 01:37:01,103
If you weren't shrewd would
you have followed..

1603
01:37:01,746 --> 01:37:05,204
If a girl follows a man
do they call her shrewd?

1604
01:37:05,683 --> 01:37:07,548
What else do they say?
- You say it.

1605
01:37:07,685 --> 01:37:09,846
I don't know.
- Lies!

1606
01:37:09,987 --> 01:37:11,545
You won't say it even
if you know it.

1607
01:37:11,689 --> 01:37:13,156
I really don't know about it.
- Really?

1608
01:37:13,291 --> 01:37:18,092
Shall I say it?
- No, no, no, no.

1609
01:37:18,229 --> 01:37:22,290
Why no?
- You don't know.

1610
01:37:22,667 --> 01:37:24,965
What if she says something
I don't like?

1611
01:37:25,102 --> 01:37:26,091
Let her say it. What about it?

1612
01:37:26,237 --> 01:37:27,932
How long will she remain quiet?

1613
01:37:28,072 --> 01:37:29,130
What will she do?

1614
01:37:29,273 --> 01:37:30,934
She will surely say
what she wants to.

1615
01:37:31,075 --> 01:37:32,064
That is only if I am willing
to listen to her.

1616
01:37:32,210 --> 01:37:33,199
She will write a love letter.

1617
01:37:34,011 --> 01:37:35,706
Why are you so scared
of a love letter?

1618
01:37:35,847 --> 01:37:38,714
Meena, I don't like all
this. Take it back.

1619
01:37:38,850 --> 01:37:40,909
This letter is written
to me by someone else.

1620
01:37:43,054 --> 01:37:45,716
Who?
- My cousin. Read it.

1621
01:37:46,858 --> 01:37:49,918
It is wrong to read other's
letter. It is wrong.

1622
01:37:50,728 --> 01:37:52,093
I am asking you to read it.

1623
01:37:52,230 --> 01:37:53,720
Can I read it just
because you say it?

1624
01:37:53,865 --> 01:37:54,991
All this is not good.

1625
01:37:55,733 --> 01:37:57,257
Mr. Ranga, look here.

1626
01:37:59,036 --> 01:38:01,937
I went to the eye doctor.
They put some drops.

1627
01:38:02,073 --> 01:38:05,873
My sight is very foggy.
Please read this for me.

1628
01:38:06,010 --> 01:38:07,204
Can't you understand?

1629
01:38:07,945 --> 01:38:09,674
It is not right to read other's
letter. It is wrong.

1630
01:38:09,814 --> 01:38:11,213
You mean a lot to me.

1631
01:38:11,682 --> 01:38:13,047
That is why I am asking
you without hesitation.

1632
01:38:13,684 --> 01:38:15,675
Please read it.

1633
01:38:22,827 --> 01:38:29,926
My dear Meena, you hunt
me with your pretty eyes.

1634
01:38:30,067 --> 01:38:34,231
You attract me with
your sweet words.

1635
01:38:34,972 --> 01:38:36,906
You try to trap me in
the jail of love.

1636
01:38:39,043 --> 01:38:40,704
Read ahead. -
- Yes.

1637
01:38:41,846 --> 01:38:45,247
I have not said a word
that will give you joy.

1638
01:38:45,716 --> 01:38:47,581
It is because of
my shyness and..

1639
01:38:47,718 --> 01:38:50,710
..I don't have the
guts that you have.

1640
01:38:50,855 --> 01:38:54,916
You tell me. Can he be so
scared about such things?

1641
01:38:55,059 --> 01:38:56,924
It is not right. He is useless.

1642
01:38:57,061 --> 01:38:58,119
He doesn't have the experience.

1643
01:38:58,729 --> 01:39:00,720
That is why I am writing
this letter.

1644
01:39:00,865 --> 01:39:02,765
My dear Meena, I love you.

1645
01:39:05,202 --> 01:39:07,102
Please read that last
sentence once again.

1646
01:39:07,238 --> 01:39:09,229
Last sentence. Once more.
I'll read it.

1647
01:39:10,374 --> 01:39:13,138
My dear Meena, I love you.
- Thank you.

1648
01:39:14,278 --> 01:39:17,008
What is this? The name of
the sender is not on it.

1649
01:39:18,149 --> 01:39:19,912
That is why I have come
in search of you.

1650
01:39:20,051 --> 01:39:22,144
Please write your name.

1651
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:24,911
What happened?
- Ants. Bit me.

1652
01:39:25,056 --> 01:39:26,921
Where?
- There. Red ants. It fell down.

1653
01:39:30,061 --> 01:39:31,289
Laugh all you please.

1654
01:39:31,929 --> 01:39:34,159
I know what I am going through.

1655
01:39:34,932 --> 01:39:36,126
What is this?

1656
01:39:36,267 --> 01:39:38,929
Why do you get angry when
a sweet girl loves you?

1657
01:39:39,070 --> 01:39:40,935
Who wants her love?

1658
01:39:42,073 --> 01:39:43,802
I am going to bow before
her and tell her..

1659
01:39:43,941 --> 01:39:45,966
..that I am married
please leave me..

1660
01:39:46,110 --> 01:39:48,305
..alone and find someone else.

1661
01:39:48,446 --> 01:39:55,147
Don't! Don't say that! It
is an oath on you. Don't!

1662
01:39:55,286 --> 01:39:57,186
Why? Why?

1663
01:39:59,323 --> 01:40:00,813
I don't know why but
by coming into this..

1664
01:40:00,958 --> 01:40:03,927
..tasteless life of mine Meena..

1665
01:40:04,061 --> 01:40:07,428
..has brought a lot of delight.

1666
01:40:08,199 --> 01:40:09,757
I like very much to hear about..

1667
01:40:09,900 --> 01:40:13,131
..her and cut jokes about her.

1668
01:40:13,270 --> 01:40:16,933
I forget all my pain
I keep laughing.

1669
01:40:17,908 --> 01:40:19,102
Is it?

1670
01:40:20,244 --> 01:40:21,768
If you are happy and
keep smiling then..

1671
01:40:21,912 --> 01:40:24,142
..I won't tell her anything.

1672
01:40:25,282 --> 01:40:27,910
I'll continue to make fun
and keep telling you.

1673
01:40:28,919 --> 01:40:30,113
Is it all right?

1674
01:40:55,279 --> 01:40:58,180
Meena, hasn't your
Shantamma come?

1675
01:40:58,315 --> 01:41:00,215
That is why I have come.
I want to offer prayers.

1676
01:41:00,351 --> 01:41:03,218
In your name?
- No. In the name of Ranga.

1677
01:41:03,287 --> 01:41:08,122
Who is Ranga? What is his star?
- I don't know.

1678
01:41:17,268 --> 01:41:22,934
Sister, I'll sit here. Will
you go and get a taxi?

1679
01:41:23,074 --> 01:41:24,166
Ok, madam.

1680
01:41:37,988 --> 01:41:39,853
Meena, after visiting a temple..

1681
01:41:39,990 --> 01:41:41,981
..you must sit for a minute.

1682
01:41:43,126 --> 01:41:44,991
How do you know my name?

1683
01:41:46,129 --> 01:41:50,190
I heard the priest address
you. Come sit here.

1684
01:41:51,334 --> 01:41:53,029
What is your name?
- It is Kamala.

1685
01:41:58,175 --> 01:41:59,267
Why are you looking
at me like that?

1686
01:42:01,011 --> 01:42:03,343
I had a sister. When I saw
you I was reminded of her.

1687
01:42:03,480 --> 01:42:04,538
I too had a sister.

1688
01:42:05,282 --> 01:42:10,276
If she was alive now she
would have been like you.

1689
01:42:10,420 --> 01:42:12,012
Are you married, Meena?

1690
01:42:13,156 --> 01:42:15,556
Have they chosen a groom
for you? -- Yes.

1691
01:42:16,026 --> 01:42:17,891
Is it the Ranga on whose name..

1692
01:42:18,028 --> 01:42:19,290
..you offered the prayers?

1693
01:42:20,430 --> 01:42:22,398
Is he your relative?
- No. A friend.

1694
01:42:23,033 --> 01:42:25,228
What is he like?
- He is very nice.

1695
01:42:26,369 --> 01:42:27,393
He is always jovial.

1696
01:42:28,538 --> 01:42:31,371
If I see him I could keep
watching him all day.

1697
01:42:32,509 --> 01:42:36,343
When I hear him talk I feel
like listening to him all my life.

1698
01:42:37,480 --> 01:42:38,845
To tell you the
truth you can't..

1699
01:42:38,982 --> 01:42:40,973
..find someone like
him in lakh.

1700
01:42:42,118 --> 01:42:43,847
You should have done penance..

1701
01:42:43,987 --> 01:42:48,356
..if you want to marry him.

1702
01:42:49,492 --> 01:42:52,859
For the sake of his wife
he is giving up himself..

1703
01:42:52,996 --> 01:42:58,525
He is not yet married.
- I know that.

1704
01:42:59,336 --> 01:43:03,238
I meant to say that he will
give his life for his wife.

1705
01:43:03,373 --> 01:43:05,000
How do you know that?

1706
01:43:05,141 --> 01:43:06,369
That is a skill I have.

1707
01:43:06,509 --> 01:43:07,874
When I listen to a person's..

1708
01:43:08,011 --> 01:43:09,535
..name I know everything
about him.

1709
01:43:11,014 --> 01:43:12,208
Today is my birthday.

1710
01:43:12,349 --> 01:43:14,214
You must surely
come to my house.

1711
01:43:15,352 --> 01:43:17,217
I am really sorry.
I am a patient.

1712
01:43:17,354 --> 01:43:18,878
I have taken permission from
the doctor to visit..

1713
01:43:19,022 --> 01:43:20,216
..the temple on occasion
of the new year day.

1714
01:43:20,357 --> 01:43:22,222
The nurse has gone
to fetch the taxi.

1715
01:43:22,359 --> 01:43:23,383
I am not allowed to go anywhere.

1716
01:43:23,526 --> 01:43:25,221
You said that I am like
your younger sister.

1717
01:43:25,362 --> 01:43:26,886
An elder sister can't say that
she will not come for..

1718
01:43:27,030 --> 01:43:28,292
..her younger sister's birthday.

1719
01:43:28,431 --> 01:43:29,420
I'll take permission
from the doctor.

1720
01:43:29,566 --> 01:43:31,261
Oh no! Please don't! - It is
all right. Please. Come.

1721
01:43:33,403 --> 01:43:36,201
Greetings. Greetings.
There she is.

1722
01:43:36,339 --> 01:43:37,966
Why have you delayed so much?

1723
01:43:38,108 --> 01:43:39,234
Everyone is waiting for you.

1724
01:43:39,376 --> 01:43:41,503
This is Kamala. I met
her at the temple.

1725
01:43:41,978 --> 01:43:43,172
Greetings.
- Greetings.

1726
01:43:43,980 --> 01:43:46,175
Please sit down, dear.
- Thank you.

1727
01:43:48,318 --> 01:43:50,252
Meena, meet my friends. Rajesh.

1728
01:43:50,387 --> 01:43:51,979
Hello. Thank you.

1729
01:43:52,989 --> 01:43:54,183
Hi Meena!

1730
01:43:54,324 --> 01:43:57,191
If the birthday baby is so
late who will cut the cake?

1731
01:43:57,327 --> 01:43:59,192
I am ready.
- Thank you.

1732
01:44:02,332 --> 01:44:05,233
Hey! kamalu! How
did you get here?

1733
01:44:06,002 --> 01:44:07,264
I don't know who you are.

1734
01:44:07,404 --> 01:44:08,996
You should behave
the same way too.

1735
01:44:09,139 --> 01:44:10,265
What do you mean?

1736
01:44:10,407 --> 01:44:12,204
It is my oath on you. Don't
say anything about me.

1737
01:44:15,011 --> 01:44:16,273
Mr. Ranga!
- Hello!

1738
01:44:16,413 --> 01:44:17,402
Welcome.

1739
01:44:19,015 --> 01:44:22,007
I was waiting not to start the
function until you come.

1740
01:44:23,153 --> 01:44:26,384
Kamala, this is the man
you told me about.

1741
01:44:27,023 --> 01:44:29,014
What?
- Mr. Ranga.

1742
01:44:30,160 --> 01:44:33,561
Ok. He talks very nicely.
Cuts jokes.

1743
01:44:34,397 --> 01:44:36,297
That you like him very
much. Is it him?

1744
01:44:37,434 --> 01:44:38,458
Greetings.
- Greetings.

1745
01:44:38,601 --> 01:44:39,590
I am very glad to meet you.

1746
01:44:40,203 --> 01:44:41,966
Actually our Meena likes you..

1747
01:44:42,105 --> 01:44:45,336
Shall we start?
- Sure.

1748
01:44:45,475 --> 01:44:46,464
Please come.

1749
01:44:46,609 --> 01:44:47,598
Hey you!

1750
01:44:52,115 --> 01:44:54,106
"Happy birthday to you."

1751
01:45:07,263 --> 01:45:10,323
Meena, for the party to
be fun someone must sing.

1752
01:45:11,134 --> 01:45:12,328
Why don't you sing a song?

1753
01:45:12,469 --> 01:45:16,337
I know only devotional songs.

1754
01:45:16,473 --> 01:45:19,169
Mr. Ranga I heard that
you sing very well.

1755
01:45:19,309 --> 01:45:21,334
What do I do about it?
- You must sing.

1756
01:45:22,479 --> 01:45:25,346
Yes. Please sing a song.

1757
01:45:26,483 --> 01:45:28,348
I seem to have a cough
and a hoarse throat.

1758
01:45:28,485 --> 01:45:31,511
When men have a hoarse throat
the voice sounds good.

1759
01:45:32,155 --> 01:45:33,520
Why are you compelling me?

1760
01:45:34,391 --> 01:45:35,449
Why don't you sing
whatever you know?

1761
01:45:36,092 --> 01:45:37,354
Why are you getting angry?

1762
01:45:37,494 --> 01:45:39,086
Is it wrong to ask you to sing?

1763
01:45:39,229 --> 01:45:41,288
Meena says that you always
have a smiling face.

1764
01:45:41,431 --> 01:45:43,296
Is this the smiling face?

1765
01:45:43,433 --> 01:45:44,457
No. I have a crying face.

1766
01:45:45,101 --> 01:45:47,092
She will feel bad.
Please sing a song.

1767
01:45:47,237 --> 01:45:49,296
What song shall I sing?

1768
01:45:50,440 --> 01:45:52,431
Think about a person whom
you like and sing.

1769
01:45:56,579 --> 01:45:58,376
Someone I like.

1770
01:46:20,136 --> 01:46:23,663
"My life has been illuminated."

1771
01:46:29,579 --> 01:46:37,953
"Flower of love, after
uniting with you..

1772
01:46:38,087 --> 01:46:42,353
..my life has been illuminated."

1773
01:47:08,518 --> 01:47:16,983
"Like the fragrance has
joined the flower..

1774
01:47:17,126 --> 01:47:26,159
..Iet my life and
your life mingle..

1775
01:47:26,302 --> 01:47:32,502
..for ever my precious."

1776
01:47:33,643 --> 01:47:37,443
"My life has been illuminated."

1777
01:47:38,581 --> 01:47:40,947
"Flower of love, after
uniting with you..

1778
01:47:41,084 --> 01:47:44,281
..my life has been illuminated."

1779
01:48:12,448 --> 01:48:16,646
"You are the tune and
you are the emotion."

1780
01:48:22,392 --> 01:48:32,165
"Strum the strings of
the Veena in my heart..

1781
01:48:32,302 --> 01:48:46,114
..and dance to it,
my pretty one."

1782
01:48:46,249 --> 01:48:49,480
"Flower of love, my life
has been illuminated."

1783
01:48:50,620 --> 01:48:55,250
"My life has been illuminated."

1784
01:48:56,392 --> 01:48:58,952
"Flower of love, after
uniting with you..

1785
01:48:59,095 --> 01:49:02,360
..my life has been illuminated."

1786
01:49:31,527 --> 01:49:35,657
"l am the body and
you are the soul."

1787
01:49:40,803 --> 01:49:45,536
"Do the two ever separate?"

1788
01:49:46,676 --> 01:49:50,339
"Would I ever be separated
from you?"

1789
01:49:51,481 --> 01:49:55,349
"My life has been illuminated."

1790
01:49:57,487 --> 01:50:06,191
"Flower of love, after
uniting with you..

1791
01:50:06,329 --> 01:50:10,595
..my life has been illuminated."

1792
01:50:22,879 --> 01:50:24,210
Are you playing games?

1793
01:50:24,347 --> 01:50:26,406
Do you think you are not
answerable to anyone?

1794
01:50:26,549 --> 01:50:28,676
Horlicks!
- Why should I drink Horlicks?

1795
01:50:29,819 --> 01:50:31,218
In order to maintain
your health..

1796
01:50:31,354 --> 01:50:32,548
..always drink only Horlicks.

1797
01:50:33,890 --> 01:50:35,152
As it is your health is poor.

1798
01:50:35,625 --> 01:50:37,616
I don't want your
special effects.

1799
01:50:39,295 --> 01:50:40,284
Why did you come to
attend that party?

1800
01:50:40,430 --> 01:50:41,419
Where did you find her?

1801
01:50:42,298 --> 01:50:44,163
I went to the temple to
offer prayers in your..

1802
01:50:44,300 --> 01:50:47,565
..name because it is the
beginning of the new year

1803
01:50:48,304 --> 01:50:50,169
She too came there and offered..

1804
01:50:50,306 --> 01:50:51,637
..prayers in your name too.

1805
01:50:52,308 --> 01:50:53,297
Why did she offer
prayers in my name?

1806
01:50:55,311 --> 01:50:57,176
That is when I found out
that she is Meena.

1807
01:50:57,313 --> 01:50:59,178
How can you go to her house
as soon as you met her?

1808
01:50:59,849 --> 01:51:02,511
Poor thing. She compelled
me so much.

1809
01:51:03,319 --> 01:51:04,445
How could I refuse her?

1810
01:51:05,455 --> 01:51:06,444
She doesn't have any brains..

1811
01:51:06,589 --> 01:51:08,454
..but what happened
to your brains?

1812
01:51:09,592 --> 01:51:10,581
You were making fun of me..

1813
01:51:10,727 --> 01:51:12,194
..by address me as Mister.

1814
01:51:12,662 --> 01:51:14,186
You also forced me to
sing in front of her.

1815
01:51:15,331 --> 01:51:17,595
It was only because
Meena wished so.

1816
01:51:18,735 --> 01:51:19,724
Thanks to her I too
had the good..

1817
01:51:19,869 --> 01:51:21,200
..fortune of listening
to your song.

1818
01:51:22,338 --> 01:51:24,602
As if you have never
heard me sing.

1819
01:51:25,475 --> 01:51:26,464
As if it is a rarity.

1820
01:51:27,744 --> 01:51:28,733
Not that but today your song..

1821
01:51:28,878 --> 01:51:34,475
..brought me a lot of
contentment. Take this.

1822
01:51:41,824 --> 01:51:43,621
Which is Ranga's house?
- The house numbered 2.

1823
01:51:58,641 --> 01:52:00,165
Ranga!
- Who is it?

1824
01:52:04,313 --> 01:52:05,302
Meena, what are you doing..

1825
01:52:05,448 --> 01:52:06,437
..here all of a sudden?

1826
01:52:06,582 --> 01:52:07,571
How did you find my house?

1827
01:52:07,717 --> 01:52:08,706
Is it very difficult
to find your house?

1828
01:52:09,318 --> 01:52:10,444
You must come to my
house right now.

1829
01:52:13,523 --> 01:52:14,512
How can you ask me to come..

1830
01:52:14,657 --> 01:52:15,646
..home at such short notice?

1831
01:52:16,325 --> 01:52:19,317
My mother..
- Mother? Is she fine?

1832
01:52:20,463 --> 01:52:23,591
She is fine. Come
home you will know.

1833
01:52:26,335 --> 01:52:27,324
Aunty is not at home. She
has gone to the temple.

1834
01:52:27,470 --> 01:52:28,459
It is all right.

1835
01:52:36,279 --> 01:52:38,611
Where will you find someone
better than him?

1836
01:52:39,282 --> 01:52:41,147
When the opportune
time arrives..

1837
01:52:41,284 --> 01:52:42,273
Here he is. Please come.
Please come.

1838
01:52:42,418 --> 01:52:43,407
Please come.

1839
01:52:43,553 --> 01:52:44,542
You have come when we were..

1840
01:52:44,687 --> 01:52:45,676
..talking about something happy.

1841
01:52:45,822 --> 01:52:46,811
Sit down.

1842
01:52:47,290 --> 01:52:48,279
Is that all?

1843
01:52:49,826 --> 01:52:51,555
I got scared when I saw your
daughter so agitated.

1844
01:52:52,295 --> 01:52:53,284
I thought aunty Shantmamma
was unwell.

1845
01:52:53,429 --> 01:52:54,418
I was so anxious.

1846
01:52:56,299 --> 01:52:58,164
I am as fit as a fiddle.
Come and sit down.

1847
01:52:58,835 --> 01:53:00,166
I wanted to talk to
you about something..

1848
01:53:00,303 --> 01:53:02,567
..important.
- Tell me aunty.

1849
01:53:03,506 --> 01:53:04,495
Haven't you seen Meena?

1850
01:53:06,309 --> 01:53:07,571
I have seen her from the
time I have met her.

1851
01:53:07,844 --> 01:53:09,175
How is she?

1852
01:53:10,313 --> 01:53:12,178
She is like an ivory doll.

1853
01:53:12,315 --> 01:53:13,304
She has grown up.

1854
01:53:13,850 --> 01:53:16,580
We want to get her married
at the earliest.

1855
01:53:17,320 --> 01:53:18,309
Go ahead and do it.

1856
01:53:19,322 --> 01:53:21,187
We wanted to know your
opinion about it.

1857
01:53:22,725 --> 01:53:24,716
That is why we asked
you to come.

1858
01:53:25,795 --> 01:53:26,784
What is the relation between..

1859
01:53:26,929 --> 01:53:28,191
..my opinion and
Meena's marriage?

1860
01:53:31,334 --> 01:53:32,323
We all wish that you
should become the..

1861
01:53:32,468 --> 01:53:33,457
..son-in-law of this house.

1862
01:53:33,603 --> 01:53:34,592
Why are you so deep in thoughts?

1863
01:53:34,737 --> 01:53:36,261
Actually according to
my horoscope there is..

1864
01:53:36,405 --> 01:53:38,134
..some bad omen according
to which my..

1865
01:53:38,274 --> 01:53:40,401
..wife will die within
a year of marriage.

1866
01:53:41,811 --> 01:53:45,144
Is it? May God keep you well.

1867
01:53:45,815 --> 01:53:48,147
If it was someone else
he would have changed..

1868
01:53:48,284 --> 01:53:50,343
..the horoscope for
greed of the..

1869
01:53:50,486 --> 01:53:51,475
..property and would
have married her.

1870
01:53:51,621 --> 01:53:53,145
Thank God. You have saved
my daughter's life.

1871
01:54:24,320 --> 01:54:25,582
Sister, sister. Where is Kamalu?

1872
01:54:26,322 --> 01:54:27,311
Operation theatre.
- Operation theatre?

1873
01:54:35,431 --> 01:54:38,696
Mr. Ranga, Anusuya is
being operated upon.

1874
01:54:39,835 --> 01:54:41,700
The doctor says that if
the operation goes well..

1875
01:54:41,837 --> 01:54:42,826
..there will be no problem
in the future.

1876
01:54:43,706 --> 01:54:45,697
Don't worry. God will take
care of everything.

1877
01:54:46,976 --> 01:54:48,307
Subbu, where is Kamala?

1878
01:54:49,445 --> 01:54:50,434
You are such an anxious person.

1879
01:54:51,447 --> 01:54:53,312
She might be sitting in the
lawn outside. Go and look.

1880
01:55:17,006 --> 01:55:18,337
Kamalu, what is this?

1881
01:55:19,475 --> 01:55:20,464
What are you standing alone
and thinking about?

1882
01:55:20,676 --> 01:55:21,665
When did you come?

1883
01:55:22,478 --> 01:55:23,467
It has been an hour
since I came.

1884
01:55:24,480 --> 01:55:26,471
What are you thinking so deeply?

1885
01:55:28,484 --> 01:55:30,349
Kamalu, what is it, dear?

1886
01:55:31,487 --> 01:55:33,352
Today Anusuya is getting
operated upon.

1887
01:55:35,424 --> 01:55:37,289
I think this horrible disease..

1888
01:55:37,426 --> 01:55:39,690
..will distance me from you.

1889
01:55:41,764 --> 01:55:42,753
Don't say such a thing again.

1890
01:55:45,968 --> 01:55:47,765
How is it possible for
you to leave me and go?

1891
01:55:48,971 --> 01:55:50,768
Two bodies and one soul.

1892
01:55:52,441 --> 01:55:55,433
Can Ranga survive
without Kamalu?

1893
01:55:57,947 --> 01:56:07,686
"Our life is like honey and
milk mix to become one."

1894
01:56:14,463 --> 01:56:25,863
"Our life is like honey and
milk mix to become one."

1895
01:56:27,009 --> 01:56:30,342
"Keep smiling and be merry."

1896
01:56:31,480 --> 01:56:34,415
"Be a heap of happiness.
Life is a sweet song."

1897
01:56:35,751 --> 01:56:43,283
"Our life is like honey and
milk mix to become one."

1898
01:57:26,469 --> 01:57:30,337
"Come sun or rain I will come..

1899
01:57:30,473 --> 01:57:34,466
..with you like a shadow."

1900
01:57:38,948 --> 01:57:46,946
"I'll always bring you solace
with my sweet talk."

1901
01:57:47,957 --> 01:57:54,624
"Let this face blossom
like a flower."

1902
01:57:56,432 --> 01:58:02,962
"Let it spill the fragrance
of happiness."

1903
01:58:03,973 --> 01:58:12,438
"Be calm without worries."

1904
01:58:17,786 --> 01:58:25,318
"Our life is like honey and
milk mix to become one."

1905
01:58:57,426 --> 01:59:05,424
"Why is the face of this
lotus like a bud?"

1906
01:59:10,439 --> 01:59:17,845
"Why are you so silent?
Why are you like this?"

1907
01:59:18,981 --> 01:59:25,318
"Why do you wither in worry?"

1908
01:59:26,989 --> 01:59:30,322
"Am I not here for support."

1909
01:59:30,459 --> 01:59:34,828
"Be calm without worries."

1910
01:59:48,844 --> 01:59:56,649
"Our life is like honey and
milk mix to become one."

1911
01:59:58,053 --> 02:00:04,515
"Keep smiling and be merry."

1912
02:00:05,861 --> 02:00:08,921
"Be a heap of happiness.
Life is a sweet song."

1913
02:00:10,666 --> 02:00:17,731
"Our life is like honey and
milk mix to become one."

1914
02:00:22,211 --> 02:00:23,872
Mr. Ranga, the operation
is a success!

1915
02:00:24,013 --> 02:00:25,537
My anusuya has survived.

1916
02:00:25,681 --> 02:00:26,807
The doctor has asked me
to bring medicines.

1917
02:00:27,216 --> 02:00:28,547
I'll just go and bring them.

1918
02:00:41,163 --> 02:00:43,495
Shantamma, like there is
a fence for the garden..

1919
02:00:43,632 --> 02:00:45,497
..and a fort for
a kingdom this..

1920
02:00:45,634 --> 02:00:46,623
..house must have a lawyer.

1921
02:00:48,103 --> 02:00:49,900
My son tore one power
of attorney paper.

1922
02:00:51,974 --> 02:00:53,498
If your foolish son
Prahalada makes..

1923
02:00:53,642 --> 02:00:55,633
..another paper
what will you do?

1924
02:00:57,646 --> 02:00:58,635
What is this? Why are
you reading a book?

1925
02:00:58,781 --> 02:00:59,770
Give it to me. Listen to him.

1926
02:01:02,184 --> 02:01:03,515
You have got yourself
a troublesome alliance.

1927
02:01:04,653 --> 02:01:07,520
You never know what that
Gopala raya may be up to.

1928
02:01:07,656 --> 02:01:09,920
This is my son, a bar at law.

1929
02:01:10,659 --> 02:01:11,648
He has made a brew of the..

1930
02:01:11,794 --> 02:01:13,785
..Indian penal code
and consumed it.

1931
02:01:13,929 --> 02:01:14,918
Young aged and a good age.

1932
02:01:15,664 --> 02:01:17,529
Wherever he goes will
be prosperous.

1933
02:01:17,666 --> 02:01:18,997
We don't want any
dowry or formality.

1934
02:01:19,201 --> 02:01:20,532
Just make him your son-in-law.

1935
02:01:21,670 --> 02:01:22,932
He will stay put inside
the house..

1936
02:01:23,072 --> 02:01:24,539
..protecting the house
like an Alsatian dog.

1937
02:01:24,673 --> 02:01:27,540
You are right. You find an
auspicious time for it.

1938
02:01:28,677 --> 02:01:31,544
Shanta, you better ask
Meena and then decide.

1939
02:01:32,214 --> 02:01:33,545
What will she know?

1940
02:01:34,149 --> 02:01:35,810
It is our responsibility to
look after her interests.

1941
02:01:36,618 --> 02:01:38,483
What if she doesn't
like this alliance?

1942
02:01:38,620 --> 02:01:39,609
I am her mother.

1943
02:01:40,823 --> 02:01:42,085
I will give her two slaps
and ask her to obey me.

1944
02:01:43,225 --> 02:01:46,490
You go ahead. - You are right.
Sooner the better.

1945
02:02:13,655 --> 02:02:14,644
Who are you?

1946
02:02:16,191 --> 02:02:17,522
First close the door.
- Who are you?

1947
02:02:19,661 --> 02:02:21,652
I'll tell you later.
Isn't he home? - Who?

1948
02:02:22,664 --> 02:02:24,723
He?
- Who do you mean by he?

1949
02:02:24,867 --> 02:02:28,132
Ranga.
- Ranga? Are you Ranga's wife?

1950
02:02:29,671 --> 02:02:30,660
Yes.
- Is it?

1951
02:02:31,673 --> 02:02:33,538
Come, my dear. Come.

1952
02:02:36,145 --> 02:02:38,477
Where is he?
- He will come. You come along.

1953
02:02:40,949 --> 02:02:41,938
Sit down.

1954
02:02:45,587 --> 02:02:47,077
This girl is so pretty.

1955
02:02:47,623 --> 02:02:48,612
He has sent her to the mental
hospital and lied..

1956
02:02:48,757 --> 02:02:49,746
..that he has sent her to
the maternity hospital.

1957
02:02:49,892 --> 02:02:51,484
Let him come. I'll
take him to task.

1958
02:02:52,161 --> 02:02:53,492
What have you done?

1959
02:02:54,630 --> 02:02:55,619
What have I done, aunty?

1960
02:02:55,964 --> 02:02:57,625
You said that it is
her first delivery.

1961
02:02:58,634 --> 02:02:59,623
If the wife is a little
sick does it mean..

1962
02:02:59,768 --> 02:03:00,757
..you admit her into a hospital?

1963
02:03:00,903 --> 02:03:01,892
What can I do, aunty?

1964
02:03:02,905 --> 02:03:03,894
Can we take care of
her as comfortably..

1965
02:03:04,039 --> 02:03:05,506
..as they do at the hospital?

1966
02:03:06,175 --> 02:03:07,506
I don't know anything
about the comforts.

1967
02:03:07,643 --> 02:03:09,508
She has run away from
there and come here.

1968
02:03:10,045 --> 02:03:11,512
Who has come here?
- Your wife.

1969
02:03:11,647 --> 02:03:12,636
My wife?

1970
02:03:13,182 --> 02:03:14,513
Yes. She has run away from
the metal hospital.

1971
02:03:15,651 --> 02:03:16,640
Oh no!

1972
02:03:22,658 --> 02:03:24,523
Why did you come here?
How did you come here?

1973
02:03:24,726 --> 02:03:25,693
Who brought you here?

1974
02:03:26,662 --> 02:03:28,527
Did you come by auto or taxi?

1975
02:03:28,864 --> 02:03:29,853
I came in the auto.

1976
02:03:33,936 --> 02:03:35,733
Why did you come here?
- To see you.

1977
02:03:36,605 --> 02:03:38,470
Did you tell her that
you are my wife?

1978
02:03:38,607 --> 02:03:40,472
Why did you say that?

1979
02:03:40,609 --> 02:03:42,474
She asked me if I was your wife.

1980
02:03:42,611 --> 02:03:44,476
I didn't have the
heart to say no.

1981
02:03:46,615 --> 02:03:48,879
Why did you come here?
- To be with you.

1982
02:03:50,152 --> 02:03:52,017
Why? - What can I say
if you ask me why?

1983
02:03:53,155 --> 02:03:54,486
My parents are trying to get..

1984
02:03:54,623 --> 02:03:55,612
..me married to the bar at law.

1985
02:03:56,625 --> 02:03:58,490
How can agree to a marriage
that I don't like?

1986
02:03:58,627 --> 02:03:59,753
That is why I ran away.

1987
02:04:00,829 --> 02:04:02,626
What is wrong with him? He
has studied bar at law.

1988
02:04:03,632 --> 02:04:05,497
He is educated, good natured
and intelligent.

1989
02:04:05,634 --> 02:04:06,623
Moreover, he is good looking.

1990
02:04:07,169 --> 02:04:08,761
But he doesn't look
good to my eyes.

1991
02:04:09,838 --> 02:04:11,829
What can I do about it?
- Marry me.

1992
02:04:12,975 --> 02:04:13,964
Are you playing kids
games with me?

1993
02:04:14,643 --> 02:04:15,632
We'll have kids after a year.

1994
02:04:16,178 --> 02:04:17,509
Shut up!
- All right.

1995
02:04:18,981 --> 02:04:19,970
Nothing doing. Get out!

1996
02:04:22,184 --> 02:04:24,049
Will you go?
- I will leave if you get angry.

1997
02:04:24,653 --> 02:04:25,642
But I won't go home. You will
never be able to see me.

1998
02:04:26,188 --> 02:04:27,519
Why should I come to see you?

1999
02:04:29,191 --> 02:04:31,523
I will commit suicide.
- I have seen many like you.

2000
02:04:31,660 --> 02:04:32,649
Aunty!

2001
02:04:37,299 --> 02:04:38,823
What happened, dear?
- It is a siren. A siren.

2002
02:04:39,768 --> 02:04:40,757
Since the new moon day is..

2003
02:04:40,903 --> 02:04:41,892
..nearing she behaves like this.

2004
02:04:42,104 --> 02:04:43,093
Hasn't she come from
the mental hospital?

2005
02:04:43,305 --> 02:04:44,636
She will behave like this.
Take care of her.

2006
02:04:48,176 --> 02:04:49,165
Why are you laughing?

2007
02:04:50,112 --> 02:04:51,636
He is the one who
is out of his mind.

2008
02:04:51,780 --> 02:04:53,111
He says I am out of my mind.

2009
02:04:54,182 --> 02:04:55,171
What are you still
thinking about?

2010
02:04:55,784 --> 02:04:56,773
Give me the girl's photo.

2011
02:04:57,319 --> 02:04:58,650
I'll put it in the paper
that she has run away.

2012
02:04:58,787 --> 02:04:59,776
Someone will find her
and bring her back.

2013
02:04:59,922 --> 02:05:00,911
Shut up!

2014
02:05:02,324 --> 02:05:03,916
Do you want to ruin the
esteem of the family by..

2015
02:05:04,059 --> 02:05:05,651
..putting the girl's
photo in the paper?

2016
02:05:05,794 --> 02:05:06,920
Is this all you have
studied to learn?

2017
02:05:08,130 --> 02:05:10,655
Don't get angry. He studied law.

2018
02:05:10,799 --> 02:05:11,788
Not home science.

2019
02:05:17,339 --> 02:05:18,670
He has left such a sweet girl..

2020
02:05:18,807 --> 02:05:22,072
..in the hospital and
is running around.

2021
02:05:23,211 --> 02:05:26,669
Am I nice, aunty?
- You are like an angel.

2022
02:05:27,816 --> 02:05:28,805
Am I a good match to him?

2023
02:05:29,818 --> 02:05:30,807
People who disagree are blind.

2024
02:05:31,820 --> 02:05:33,685
You both are a tailor
made couple.

2025
02:05:33,822 --> 02:05:35,619
Let Ranga come and see you now.

2026
02:05:37,025 --> 02:05:38,014
You are back, are you?!

2027
02:05:39,761 --> 02:05:40,750
Do you know what your
aunty is saying?

2028
02:05:40,963 --> 02:05:41,952
What did she say?

2029
02:05:44,032 --> 02:05:45,021
She says that we are
a tailor made couple.

2030
02:06:04,319 --> 02:06:05,650
What is all this?
- What?

2031
02:06:05,854 --> 02:06:06,843
Your dressing up!?

2032
02:06:07,322 --> 02:06:08,653
Your aunty did it.

2033
02:06:09,324 --> 02:06:10,313
Why did you come here?

2034
02:06:10,792 --> 02:06:11,781
Why did you close the door?

2035
02:06:11,927 --> 02:06:12,916
Your aunty sent me here
so I came here.

2036
02:06:13,061 --> 02:06:14,050
She shut the door.

2037
02:06:16,198 --> 02:06:17,665
Aunty will ask you to
go back home. Go!

2038
02:06:18,200 --> 02:06:19,189
Why would she say that?

2039
02:06:20,202 --> 02:06:21,669
Since evening she has
been telling me..

2040
02:06:21,803 --> 02:06:23,668
..how to care for my husband.

2041
02:06:25,340 --> 02:06:26,671
And what to do to
make him happy.

2042
02:06:27,342 --> 02:06:29,674
Aunty! Aunty!
- What is it?

2043
02:06:32,347 --> 02:06:34,611
Aunty, do you know the
meaning of allergy?

2044
02:06:34,750 --> 02:06:37,617
How can I know? I
only know to cook.

2045
02:06:37,753 --> 02:06:42,622
At least you know that! It
is disliking something.

2046
02:06:42,758 --> 02:06:44,020
She is allergic to husband.

2047
02:06:45,093 --> 02:06:46,890
Just the mention of her husband
will make her mad.

2048
02:06:48,096 --> 02:06:50,087
Oh God! - That is why you
go and sleep with her.

2049
02:06:51,299 --> 02:06:53,028
Why should l?
- That is why I said allergy.

2050
02:06:53,301 --> 02:06:54,632
Is that so? -
- Yes.

2051
02:06:55,771 --> 02:06:58,638
Just go inside. I'll tell you.
Go inside. Latch the door.

2052
02:07:24,800 --> 02:07:26,199
Oh no! My father is
coming this way.

2053
02:07:30,205 --> 02:07:32,867
Is it? Thank God.
Get going home.

2054
02:07:34,076 --> 02:07:35,202
Ranga!
- Yes.

2055
02:07:37,079 --> 02:07:38,603
If you tell him anything
about my presence here..

2056
02:07:38,747 --> 02:07:39,736
..I'll commit suicide.

2057
02:07:39,881 --> 02:07:40,870
Ranga!
- I'm coming.

2058
02:07:41,283 --> 02:07:42,272
Please!

2059
02:07:49,091 --> 02:07:50,080
Greetings to you.
- Greetings.

2060
02:07:50,225 --> 02:07:51,214
How come you have come this far?

2061
02:07:51,359 --> 02:07:52,621
Please come in. Sit down.

2062
02:07:53,295 --> 02:07:54,626
It is all right. You come
here. Let's talk.

2063
02:07:57,766 --> 02:08:00,030
I am in a fix, Ranga.

2064
02:08:01,169 --> 02:08:02,158
That marriage uncle
has brought..

2065
02:08:02,304 --> 02:08:03,896
..his son and kept
him in our house.

2066
02:08:04,773 --> 02:08:05,762
He is not like you.

2067
02:08:06,775 --> 02:08:07,764
From the time he has come..

2068
02:08:07,909 --> 02:08:09,103
..my question papers
are all going waste.

2069
02:08:10,779 --> 02:08:12,644
Is it? I don't have
a penny in my hand.

2070
02:08:14,983 --> 02:08:17,042
I'll tell you the secret
of my family.

2071
02:08:18,320 --> 02:08:19,651
You want to tell me? -
- Yes.

2072
02:08:20,789 --> 02:08:21,778
I had an elder daughter
named Sita.

2073
02:08:23,325 --> 02:08:24,656
She was in love with someone..

2074
02:08:24,793 --> 02:08:25,782
..and the worst happened.

2075
02:08:26,328 --> 02:08:27,795
She never told us who he was.

2076
02:08:29,331 --> 02:08:30,662
When Shanta found out about..

2077
02:08:30,799 --> 02:08:31,788
..it she was very angry.

2078
02:08:32,801 --> 02:08:34,598
Sita left home.

2079
02:08:35,737 --> 02:08:37,864
After four months we
got to know through..

2080
02:08:38,006 --> 02:08:39,735
..a nurse that she died
after delivery.

2081
02:08:40,742 --> 02:08:43,609
Since that day bringing
up that..

2082
02:08:43,745 --> 02:08:45,610
..child was my responsibility.

2083
02:08:47,082 --> 02:08:48,811
I am bringing up that child
in the and educating..

2084
02:08:48,950 --> 02:08:51,748
..him in a convent without
Shanta's knowledge.

2085
02:08:52,954 --> 02:08:54,615
When I need money for
that child's expenses..

2086
02:08:54,756 --> 02:08:56,621
..I tell lies about tax
or something else and..

2087
02:08:56,758 --> 02:08:57,816
..extricate the money.

2088
02:09:00,028 --> 02:09:01,620
From the time that bar
at law has come..

2089
02:09:01,763 --> 02:09:04,630
..I am not even able
to pay the fees.

2090
02:09:06,301 --> 02:09:07,632
If I don't pay the
fees tomorrow..

2091
02:09:07,769 --> 02:09:10,636
..they said they will send
the child back home.

2092
02:09:12,774 --> 02:09:13,763
You don't worry about anything.

2093
02:09:14,910 --> 02:09:18,311
I will pay the fees.
- Thank you very much.

2094
02:09:19,047 --> 02:09:20,036
One more thing.

2095
02:09:21,183 --> 02:09:22,912
Meena is scared that she
will be married off..

2096
02:09:23,051 --> 02:09:24,643
..against her wishes and
has run away from home.

2097
02:09:26,788 --> 02:09:28,779
I am scared that she might
follow her sister.

2098
02:09:31,193 --> 02:09:32,182
Where will she go? She
will surely return.

2099
02:09:32,327 --> 02:09:33,658
You don't be scared
about anything.

2100
02:09:34,429 --> 02:09:35,418
Which school is the child in?

2101
02:09:39,968 --> 02:09:40,957
I have come to pay the fees of..

2102
02:09:41,102 --> 02:09:42,091
..Mr. Ugranarasimha's
grand child.

2103
02:09:42,504 --> 02:09:43,835
Is it? Why hasn't he come?

2104
02:09:45,974 --> 02:09:47,236
He is not in town. That
is why he has sent me.

2105
02:09:47,509 --> 02:09:48,976
All right.
- Where is the child?

2106
02:09:50,245 --> 02:09:51,234
He is outside. Playing.
- Is it? May I see him?

2107
02:09:51,379 --> 02:09:52,368
Come. I'll show him to you.

2108
02:09:55,984 --> 02:09:56,973
See. This is him.

2109
02:09:59,187 --> 02:10:00,848
Teacher, tomorrow is a holiday.

2110
02:10:00,989 --> 02:10:02,320
Can I take the child home? -
- Yes. Take him.

2111
02:10:04,392 --> 02:10:05,381
Shall we go home, kid?

2112
02:10:08,196 --> 02:10:09,185
Sorry, dear. Sorry. I didn't
know. Are you hurt?

2113
02:10:09,331 --> 02:10:10,320
Please don't feel bad.

2114
02:10:14,002 --> 02:10:19,872
Aunty! Aunty!
- Whose child is this?

2115
02:10:25,013 --> 02:10:26,002
This? It is mine.
- Is it your child?

2116
02:10:26,348 --> 02:10:27,872
Yes. Is he nice?
- What is this, dear?

2117
02:10:28,550 --> 02:10:29,881
Couldn't you tell me that
you have a child?

2118
02:10:30,018 --> 02:10:31,007
The mother is in one place..

2119
02:10:31,152 --> 02:10:32,141
..and the child in another.

2120
02:10:32,354 --> 02:10:36,950
What is this weirdness? I
don't understand a thing.

2121
02:10:39,961 --> 02:10:41,826
Are you hungry? Have
the biscuits.

2122
02:10:41,963 --> 02:10:42,952
You can drink milk later.

2123
02:10:49,971 --> 02:10:51,962
Do you see him? Do you
know the truth now?

2124
02:10:53,975 --> 02:10:57,843
Yes. I learnt the truth and
I also see that this..

2125
02:10:57,979 --> 02:11:00,846
..orphan child needs a
mother and you need a..

2126
02:11:00,982 --> 02:11:03,849
..wife and makes my place..

2127
02:11:03,985 --> 02:11:05,850
..in this house permanent.

2128
02:11:08,456 --> 02:11:10,856
Smart child. Come to me.
Look at aunty.

2129
02:11:11,993 --> 02:11:12,982
I can kick myself.

2130
02:11:15,530 --> 02:11:20,866
"Don't go away, Ranga."

2131
02:11:29,544 --> 02:11:33,002
"Don't go out of
the door, Ranga."

2132
02:11:34,149 --> 02:11:35,138
"lf someone sees you alone..

2133
02:11:35,283 --> 02:11:36,272
..they might carry you away."

2134
02:11:36,952 --> 02:11:39,944
"Don't go away, Ranga."

2135
02:11:41,957 --> 02:11:47,953
"Sages and saints behold
you in their hearts."

2136
02:11:48,964 --> 02:11:51,956
"They will yearn to
see their Lord."

2137
02:12:21,997 --> 02:12:24,864
"They would consider that
they have got a rare..

2138
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:28,265
..thing that and will gather
you in their arms will glee."

2139
02:13:03,972 --> 02:13:06,839
"Don't go away, Ranga."

2140
02:13:29,197 --> 02:13:31,859
"You have innumerable
qualities..

2141
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:35,197
..and all the women in
the world dote on you."

2142
02:13:36,337 --> 02:13:39,932
" You speak so sweetly
and they would all..

2143
02:13:40,075 --> 02:13:45,069
..consider you a the gem
among kids that they..

2144
02:13:45,213 --> 02:13:52,813
..have laid their hands
on and will clutch you."

2145
02:14:03,364 --> 02:14:06,356
"Don't go away, Ranga."

2146
02:14:33,161 --> 02:14:38,963
"Other women show their
love for you."

2147
02:14:40,101 --> 02:14:45,971
"They will follow
you everywhere."

2148
02:14:59,120 --> 02:15:04,581
"The Purandhara Vitthala
who created you..

2149
02:15:04,726 --> 02:15:11,996
..has given you only
so much to love."

2150
02:15:26,548 --> 02:15:29,540
"Don't go away, Ranga."

2151
02:15:31,152 --> 02:15:36,488
"Don't go out of
the door, Ranga."

2152
02:16:21,135 --> 02:16:25,003
Aunty! Aunty! Where
is the child?

2153
02:16:25,139 --> 02:16:26,128
He took him away early
in the morning.

2154
02:16:37,085 --> 02:16:39,212
Where is the child?
- Where he should be.

2155
02:16:39,621 --> 02:16:40,952
Why did you take him today?

2156
02:16:42,090 --> 02:16:43,955
He will miss his classes and
lessons if he stays here.

2157
02:16:44,626 --> 02:16:47,356
Today is Sunday. - Why do
you bother about all this?

2158
02:16:48,429 --> 02:16:50,226
Everyone must stay
where they belong.

2159
02:16:51,432 --> 02:16:52,956
It is because you are
so hard hearted..

2160
02:16:53,101 --> 02:16:54,227
..that your wife died
without living.

2161
02:17:12,320 --> 02:17:13,309
You really were hasty.
Poor thing.

2162
02:17:15,390 --> 02:17:16,379
Should you have slapped her?

2163
02:17:17,258 --> 02:17:18,247
Why should she have
said these things?

2164
02:17:19,527 --> 02:17:20,516
Am I stone hearted?

2165
02:17:21,529 --> 02:17:22,518
To me you are a flower.

2166
02:17:24,532 --> 02:17:25,999
I don't know why it
pierced my heart..

2167
02:17:26,134 --> 02:17:30,264
..when you said
that you hit her.

2168
02:17:31,139 --> 02:17:35,337
Kamalu, have I ever done
anything to hurt you?

2169
02:17:37,278 --> 02:17:40,406
I couldn't bear it
when she said that.

2170
02:17:41,082 --> 02:17:42,140
What has happened now?

2171
02:17:43,351 --> 02:17:44,943
Just because she said that
your wife is dead..

2172
02:17:45,086 --> 02:17:47,953
..it hasn't come true,
has it? Am I not alive?

2173
02:17:48,623 --> 02:17:49,954
Poor girl.

2174
02:17:50,625 --> 02:17:51,956
She said something
without knowing.

2175
02:17:53,094 --> 02:17:55,085
Go. Go and talk to her happily.

2176
02:17:58,232 --> 02:18:03,226
What? All right.
I'll talk to her.

2177
02:18:04,105 --> 02:18:05,970
Shantamma, Meena has come back.

2178
02:18:10,111 --> 02:18:11,442
Meena, are you not answerable
to anyone?

2179
02:18:12,113 --> 02:18:13,978
Tell me where you went?

2180
02:18:15,116 --> 02:18:16,378
Shantamma! She has just arrived.

2181
02:18:17,118 --> 02:18:18,983
Don't make her run away again.

2182
02:18:19,654 --> 02:18:22,987
Then she didn't like this
marriage she left.

2183
02:18:23,124 --> 02:18:25,456
Now she consents so she
is back. Isn't it?

2184
02:18:27,462 --> 02:18:29,987
Meena, do you consent
to this marriage?

2185
02:18:33,134 --> 02:18:34,066
Do you see that?

2186
02:18:36,070 --> 02:18:40,939
Meena! Meena! Aunty! Aunty!

2187
02:18:41,075 --> 02:18:42,064
What is the matter?
- Where is Meena?

2188
02:18:42,210 --> 02:18:43,199
She has gone.
- is it?

2189
02:18:46,414 --> 02:18:47,403
Why did you hit her that way?

2190
02:18:49,083 --> 02:18:50,072
You must not harass your wife.

2191
02:18:51,085 --> 02:18:52,950
Aunty, she is not my wife.
- Then?

2192
02:18:53,087 --> 02:18:54,952
She is the daughter
of an acquaintance.

2193
02:18:55,089 --> 02:18:56,351
Her parents were getting
her married to someone..

2194
02:18:56,491 --> 02:18:58,482
..against her wishes and
so she ran away here.

2195
02:18:59,093 --> 02:19:00,082
Then why didn't you tell me?

2196
02:19:00,628 --> 02:19:02,960
You said that your wife
is in the hospital.

2197
02:19:04,632 --> 02:19:07,624
Yes, aunty. My wife
is in hospital.

2198
02:19:09,103 --> 02:19:13,369
In order to get her treated
I did all these..

2199
02:19:14,308 --> 02:19:18,176
Ranga! Ranga!
- Please come. Sit down.

2200
02:19:19,113 --> 02:19:20,102
Aunty, this is Mr.
Ugranarasimha.

2201
02:19:20,248 --> 02:19:21,237
A friend of mine.
- Greetings to you.

2202
02:19:21,382 --> 02:19:22,371
Greetings. I'll get
you some coffee.

2203
02:19:25,119 --> 02:19:26,984
Ranga, you have done
me a great favour.

2204
02:19:27,121 --> 02:19:28,986
By paying my child's fees you..

2205
02:19:29,123 --> 02:19:30,112
..have saved my honour.

2206
02:19:31,125 --> 02:19:32,990
Another good news is that
Meena has come back.

2207
02:19:33,394 --> 02:19:34,554
She has consented to marry.

2208
02:19:34,829 --> 02:19:36,160
Is it? Good, good!

2209
02:19:36,831 --> 02:19:38,162
We all want to finish
this auspicious..

2210
02:19:38,299 --> 02:19:39,288
..ceremony at the earliest.

2211
02:19:39,434 --> 02:19:40,423
Such things must not be put off.

2212
02:19:40,568 --> 02:19:42,160
It is wrong to be lazy
about such things.

2213
02:19:42,303 --> 02:19:43,292
Aunty, coffee.

2214
02:19:49,310 --> 02:19:51,175
Kamalu!
- Have you come?

2215
02:19:52,313 --> 02:19:54,440
Happy news. Happy news.
- What is it?

2216
02:19:55,650 --> 02:19:56,639
Meena has agreed to
marry another girl.

2217
02:19:59,587 --> 02:20:00,576
Why, Kamalu?

2218
02:20:01,856 --> 02:20:03,187
How can you say it so happily..

2219
02:20:03,324 --> 02:20:05,588
..that she has agreed
to the marriage?

2220
02:20:06,727 --> 02:20:08,194
Do you expect me to cry
because of her wedding?

2221
02:20:09,530 --> 02:20:11,191
Poor thing. She has
agreed to marry a..

2222
02:20:11,332 --> 02:20:13,323
..guy she doesn't like
because of you.

2223
02:20:15,870 --> 02:20:19,203
Kamala, why do you think
of unwanted things?

2224
02:20:20,341 --> 02:20:22,332
Be clam. You must be happy.

2225
02:20:24,345 --> 02:20:26,336
You don't know the main thing.

2226
02:20:27,815 --> 02:20:32,343
Meena's parents don't like
love even one bit. - Why?

2227
02:20:33,354 --> 02:20:36,152
Meena had a sister named Sita.

2228
02:20:36,290 --> 02:20:41,284
Someone fell in love with
her and cheated her.

2229
02:20:41,429 --> 02:20:43,761
She gave birth to
a child and died.

2230
02:20:45,633 --> 02:20:48,158
Is it the Sita who is
Shantamma's daughter?

2231
02:20:49,303 --> 02:20:50,292
Yes. Did you know her?

2232
02:20:50,838 --> 02:20:53,170
Yes. I was then working in
the maternity hospital.

2233
02:20:53,841 --> 02:20:55,172
She stayed in my house
after delivery.

2234
02:20:56,577 --> 02:20:58,306
Do you have any idea about
the child's father?

2235
02:20:59,447 --> 02:21:00,573
No. She had brought a small box.

2236
02:21:01,315 --> 02:21:02,304
I still have it. I haven't
even opened it.

2237
02:21:02,450 --> 02:21:03,439
If you want I could search for..

2238
02:21:03,584 --> 02:21:04,573
..some letters and addresses.

2239
02:21:06,787 --> 02:21:08,186
Please. Come.
- Come.

2240
02:21:39,820 --> 02:21:40,809
Please allow the
knot to be tied.

2241
02:21:43,424 --> 02:21:44,413
Priest one minute!

2242
02:21:49,297 --> 02:21:50,286
I have to give the groom
a presentation.

2243
02:21:51,499 --> 02:21:52,488
That comes later. The
auspicious time will pass.

2244
02:21:52,633 --> 02:21:53,759
Same here.

2245
02:21:55,303 --> 02:21:56,702
I want to give him the gift
before the time passes.

2246
02:22:02,843 --> 02:22:04,174
At this auspicious
time the groom..

2247
02:22:04,378 --> 02:22:08,178
..must accept this
extraordinary gift.

2248
02:22:09,517 --> 02:22:10,506
Take it.

2249
02:22:12,320 --> 02:22:15,778
Hey! What is this?
- This? It is a child.

2250
02:22:16,724 --> 02:22:17,713
Whose?
- Yours.

2251
02:22:17,858 --> 02:22:19,189
Shut up! I am not yet married.

2252
02:22:19,327 --> 02:22:20,316
I am getting married only now.

2253
02:22:20,528 --> 02:22:22,325
You are getting married now
the child was born then.

2254
02:22:23,731 --> 02:22:27,326
When?
- When you met her sister!

2255
02:22:29,470 --> 02:22:31,665
Daddy, I will slap a defamation
case on him.

2256
02:22:32,673 --> 02:22:35,141
Yes. Don't spare him!
Don't spare him!

2257
02:22:37,278 --> 02:22:38,609
Ranga!
- Your grandchild.

2258
02:22:39,814 --> 02:22:41,543
The child you were bringing
up secretly.

2259
02:22:41,816 --> 02:22:43,147
The same child.

2260
02:22:43,284 --> 02:22:46,481
You were wondering
who his father is.

2261
02:22:47,822 --> 02:22:50,154
Look how this great man
is standing. It is him.

2262
02:22:50,758 --> 02:22:53,158
Ranga, what is this?
- That? It is this.

2263
02:22:54,362 --> 02:22:55,351
Did you see that?

2264
02:22:57,298 --> 02:23:00,563
He is the guy who cheated Sita.

2265
02:23:01,836 --> 02:23:03,167
This is your grandchild..

2266
02:23:03,571 --> 02:23:04,560
You can ask your husband
if you wish

2267
02:23:04,839 --> 02:23:06,170
Is it so, dear?

2268
02:23:08,309 --> 02:23:10,174
Yes. I am bringing up
this child secretly.

2269
02:23:10,311 --> 02:23:11,437
But I never knew that
this sinner..

2270
02:23:11,579 --> 02:23:13,513
..is the cause of my
daughter's death.

2271
02:23:14,315 --> 02:23:17,182
You tyrant! You have
ruined one daughter..

2272
02:23:17,318 --> 02:23:18,444
..and now you want
to marry the..

2273
02:23:18,586 --> 02:23:20,178
..other one for the
sake of the property!

2274
02:23:20,855 --> 02:23:22,186
Cheating, cheating! My
son is not like that!

2275
02:23:22,857 --> 02:23:24,518
Of course your son is
a very virtuous person.

2276
02:23:25,526 --> 02:23:27,187
He has come to increase
the population..

2277
02:23:27,328 --> 02:23:29,193
..of the world because
it is too low.

2278
02:23:29,797 --> 02:23:30,786
What are you looking at him for?

2279
02:23:31,332 --> 02:23:32,321
Throw him out of here.

2280
02:23:33,334 --> 02:23:36,132
Let me do that work.
- Sure come here.

2281
02:23:36,470 --> 02:23:39,405
Mr. Bar? Great man!
Law has changed.

2282
02:23:42,810 --> 02:23:44,141
Justice is lost!

2283
02:23:45,613 --> 02:23:49,481
Bar at law, you can go.
I am asking you to go.

2284
02:23:51,285 --> 02:23:55,153
You better go. 3,2,1.. I
said get out from here.

2285
02:23:58,559 --> 02:23:59,548
Why are you still standing here?

2286
02:24:02,430 --> 02:24:03,419
My son is speedy in everything.

2287
02:24:06,834 --> 02:24:09,564
Dear, did you think
I was a witch!

2288
02:24:14,308 --> 02:24:15,502
You distanced me from
such a child!

2289
02:24:16,844 --> 02:24:19,176
Ranga, you are God to me.

2290
02:24:30,858 --> 02:24:32,189
Subbu, you said you wanted..

2291
02:24:32,326 --> 02:24:33,315
..to tell me something.

2292
02:24:33,861 --> 02:24:35,294
We have admitted Kamalu..

2293
02:24:35,429 --> 02:24:36,555
..to the intensive care unit.

2294
02:24:36,697 --> 02:24:37,686
Why?
- There is no need to be scared.

2295
02:24:38,632 --> 02:24:39,621
Dr. Verma is coming over too.

2296
02:24:39,967 --> 02:24:41,764
In any case keep
10000 Rs. ready.

2297
02:24:44,438 --> 02:24:45,427
All right. It can be done.

2298
02:24:59,854 --> 02:25:00,843
I have given her injection
to sleep.

2299
02:25:00,988 --> 02:25:01,977
Let her take some rest.

2300
02:25:23,677 --> 02:25:26,669
10000 RS as loan? -
- Yes. I need 10,000 Rs.

2301
02:25:27,748 --> 02:25:29,807
My wife is very serious. I
have come with hope on you.

2302
02:25:31,018 --> 02:25:32,349
I too believed you that
there is wealth in..

2303
02:25:32,486 --> 02:25:35,284
..that house and wrote a
pro note in your name.

2304
02:25:35,956 --> 02:25:37,287
Do you think I will
give you a loan?

2305
02:25:37,625 --> 02:25:39,490
Please don't say that.
Here is your pro note.

2306
02:25:40,427 --> 02:25:41,416
You can charge me any
amount of interest.

2307
02:25:42,429 --> 02:25:43,418
Basappa, I have come
with hopes on you.

2308
02:25:44,431 --> 02:25:45,420
If you ditched me at this time..

2309
02:25:45,566 --> 02:25:46,692
..I will be in too much
trouble. Please.

2310
02:25:46,967 --> 02:25:48,298
It is no big deal for you.

2311
02:25:48,702 --> 02:25:49,691
The millionaire Shantamma will..

2312
02:25:49,837 --> 02:25:51,702
..give you as much
money as you ask.

2313
02:25:51,839 --> 02:25:55,502
If you want money
go there and ask.

2314
02:26:03,717 --> 02:26:05,446
Sir, kamala is very serious.

2315
02:26:29,743 --> 02:26:31,938
Aunty, shantamma!
Aunty shantamma!

2316
02:26:32,880 --> 02:26:34,279
Is it you? Please sit down.

2317
02:26:34,415 --> 02:26:35,404
I don't have the time to sit.
Where is Shantamma?

2318
02:26:35,549 --> 02:26:36,538
She is upstairs.

2319
02:26:38,953 --> 02:26:40,284
Aunty, shantamma! Aunty,
shantamma!

2320
02:26:40,421 --> 02:26:42,286
What is it?
- I need 1 0000 Rs. urgently.

2321
02:26:42,423 --> 02:26:43,412
Why do you need so much money?

2322
02:26:44,425 --> 02:26:46,290
Don't ask me why. But l
have to have 1 0000 Rs.

2323
02:26:46,427 --> 02:26:47,416
All right. I'll give it to you.

2324
02:26:47,561 --> 02:26:48,550
You will be doomed
if you give it.

2325
02:26:48,762 --> 02:26:51,629
He is a cheat!
- He is a traitor! - 420!

2326
02:26:54,969 --> 02:26:56,436
He has come to swallow
the property.

2327
02:26:56,770 --> 02:26:57,759
What's the matter?

2328
02:26:58,439 --> 02:26:59,428
Why have all the evil creatures
come together?

2329
02:26:59,974 --> 02:27:01,305
What do you want?

2330
02:27:12,453 --> 02:27:13,715
Shantamma, ask him what he does?

2331
02:27:14,989 --> 02:27:17,321
Were you into chit fund
business? Ask him!

2332
02:27:17,458 --> 02:27:18,584
Is it so..
- No!

2333
02:27:20,461 --> 02:27:21,450
Was his father a millionaire?
No!

2334
02:27:21,595 --> 02:27:22,584
Ask him!

2335
02:27:23,998 --> 02:27:25,465
Are you Singapore
Seetharamaiah's son?

2336
02:27:26,467 --> 02:27:27,456
Ask him. No!

2337
02:27:28,869 --> 02:27:29,927
Do you know that this
rascal sold..

2338
02:27:30,070 --> 02:27:33,335
..my car saying that
this car was his!?

2339
02:27:34,742 --> 02:27:36,266
He sold me the house
worth 15 thousand..

2340
02:27:36,410 --> 02:27:38,275
..to me for 60000 saying that..

2341
02:27:38,412 --> 02:27:39,401
..there is a wealth
in the house.

2342
02:27:40,414 --> 02:27:41,745
He has run away without
paying him 6 months rent.

2343
02:27:42,416 --> 02:27:43,610
Will you give this
rascal the money?

2344
02:27:45,419 --> 02:27:48,286
Aunty shantamma! They are
all cheaters! Thieves.

2345
02:27:48,422 --> 02:27:49,411
Don't trust what they say.

2346
02:27:50,691 --> 02:27:51,680
Have I cheated this house?

2347
02:27:52,426 --> 02:27:53,415
Have I done any
injustice to you?

2348
02:27:54,762 --> 02:27:55,751
Enough keep quiet!

2349
02:27:56,430 --> 02:27:57,419
Isn't it enough to come
here as an impostor?

2350
02:27:57,564 --> 02:27:58,553
I don't care what
you do or don't.

2351
02:27:58,699 --> 02:27:59,688
I don't want to have anything
to do with you!

2352
02:27:59,967 --> 02:28:00,956
First leave this place.

2353
02:28:04,038 --> 02:28:06,768
All right. Shantamma aunty!

2354
02:28:08,709 --> 02:28:11,439
I don't mind if you forget
what I did for your house.

2355
02:28:13,447 --> 02:28:15,312
You give more importance
to these vultures..

2356
02:28:15,449 --> 02:28:18,509
..so I don't have
to say anything.

2357
02:28:20,654 --> 02:28:21,643
You will understand
when the time comes.

2358
02:28:41,742 --> 02:28:43,607
This is Dr. Subbu from
cancer hospital.

2359
02:28:44,812 --> 02:28:47,610
Is Ranga there? His
wife is serious.

2360
02:28:48,615 --> 02:28:50,606
Will you inform him if
he comes there? Ok.

2361
02:28:51,685 --> 02:28:52,674
Sir!

2362
02:28:55,422 --> 02:28:56,411
I hope there is nothing to fear?

2363
02:28:56,557 --> 02:28:57,546
There is no need to fear.

2364
02:28:57,691 --> 02:28:58,680
But I can't say anything
until tomorrow morning.

2365
02:28:58,826 --> 02:28:59,815
I'll come and check
in the evening.

2366
02:28:59,960 --> 02:29:01,291
Shall I send you the car?

2367
02:29:01,428 --> 02:29:02,417
No need I'll come myself.

2368
02:29:02,563 --> 02:29:03,552
Greetings, sir.
- Ranga.

2369
02:29:04,431 --> 02:29:05,489
Just minute. I'll just
send off the doctor.

2370
02:29:28,455 --> 02:29:29,444
Come Ranga. Sit down.

2371
02:29:29,590 --> 02:29:30,579
Sir, is your child unwell?

2372
02:29:30,791 --> 02:29:31,780
It has been 4 days.

2373
02:29:32,459 --> 02:29:33,448
Very high fever. Doesn't
come down at all.

2374
02:29:33,594 --> 02:29:34,754
That is why I called for
the child specialist.

2375
02:29:34,895 --> 02:29:35,884
What did he say?

2376
02:29:36,630 --> 02:29:38,495
He can't say anything
until tomorrow.

2377
02:29:39,033 --> 02:29:40,022
I am so worried.

2378
02:29:42,169 --> 02:29:43,500
Don't be so worried. Everything
will be fine.

2379
02:29:43,637 --> 02:29:44,626
God will be kind to you.

2380
02:29:44,772 --> 02:29:45,761
I only hope what you
say comes true.

2381
02:29:46,640 --> 02:29:48,505
By the by what is the
reason for your coming?

2382
02:29:51,045 --> 02:29:52,034
I went to the office.

2383
02:29:52,646 --> 02:29:53,704
They said that you were
on leave for 3 days.

2384
02:29:55,182 --> 02:29:56,513
That is why I came to
enquire about you.

2385
02:29:57,051 --> 02:29:58,040
It is because the
child is not well.

2386
02:29:59,653 --> 02:30:00,642
I have to go and buy some..

2387
02:30:00,788 --> 02:30:01,982
..injections and tablets.
Shall I leave?

2388
02:30:02,122 --> 02:30:03,111
Please carry on.

2389
02:30:17,671 --> 02:30:18,660
Why have you come here?

2390
02:30:19,807 --> 02:30:20,933
I went to the office
looking for you.

2391
02:30:21,675 --> 02:30:22,664
They told me that you were here.

2392
02:30:26,680 --> 02:30:31,549
Take this. You need this.
It is all right. Take it.

2393
02:30:35,823 --> 02:30:37,620
They all accused of
being a cheat..

2394
02:30:37,758 --> 02:30:39,953
..and you too accepted it.

2395
02:30:40,627 --> 02:30:41,616
But I feel that you
are not like that.

2396
02:30:42,830 --> 02:30:45,492
Please tell me the truth.
Why did you do that?

2397
02:30:46,633 --> 02:30:50,967
Why did you lie to
my mother? Tell me.

2398
02:30:51,638 --> 02:30:54,835
I don't have the
time to talk now.

2399
02:31:51,165 --> 02:31:52,496
Subbu! Subbu!

2400
02:31:54,635 --> 02:31:55,897
You said that you might
need 10000 Rs.

2401
02:31:56,637 --> 02:31:57,626
I have brought 30000.

2402
02:31:58,639 --> 02:31:59,628
Ask me for how much
ever you want.

2403
02:32:00,641 --> 02:32:01,972
50000 or 1 lakh! I
won't be scared.

2404
02:32:03,844 --> 02:32:06,711
Subbu! I am ready for any
sacrifice for her sake!

2405
02:32:08,182 --> 02:32:09,649
Subbu! Subbu!

2406
02:32:09,783 --> 02:32:11,774
If you know how I have
earned all this money..

2407
02:32:11,919 --> 02:32:13,511
..you will be very surprised.

2408
02:32:14,655 --> 02:32:17,522
One side I said I was
not married yet.

2409
02:32:17,658 --> 02:32:19,785
I also did the job of
a marriage broker.

2410
02:32:21,195 --> 02:32:22,526
Why talk about all that now?

2411
02:32:23,197 --> 02:32:24,528
Why did I take all this trouble?

2412
02:32:26,200 --> 02:32:28,668
Only to save my Kamalu. Take it.

2413
02:32:38,078 --> 02:32:39,067
Take the money!

2414
02:32:42,883 --> 02:32:43,872
Why are you like this?

2415
02:32:44,017 --> 02:32:45,006
If you yourself lose
heart what about me?

2416
02:32:48,889 --> 02:32:49,878
Take this.

2417
02:33:14,181 --> 02:33:18,641
Kamalu! Kamalu!

2418
02:33:21,188 --> 02:33:22,917
When I saw Subbu's face
my heart broke.

2419
02:33:24,658 --> 02:33:25,647
Dr. Verma is here too.

2420
02:33:26,126 --> 02:33:27,115
He will give you good treatment.

2421
02:33:27,995 --> 02:33:28,984
You will be fine soon.

2422
02:33:31,198 --> 02:33:32,529
As soon as you are discharged
from the..

2423
02:33:32,666 --> 02:33:35,601
..hospital I will take
you to the new house.

2424
02:33:37,137 --> 02:33:39,867
Good air, good environment.

2425
02:33:41,141 --> 02:33:43,803
We can be in bliss.
We can live happily.

2426
02:33:46,613 --> 02:33:50,481
There can be no dearth for
happiness where you are.

2427
02:33:52,619 --> 02:33:55,019
You will make everyone laugh.
You will smile.

2428
02:33:56,957 --> 02:34:00,484
Even if I am not around
this smile should remain.

2429
02:34:01,828 --> 02:34:04,490
Where will I go?
I will be in you.

2430
02:34:25,919 --> 02:34:29,787
Meena, this is my wife.
My better half. My life!

2431
02:34:29,990 --> 02:34:30,979
Meena!

2432
02:34:44,104 --> 02:34:49,633
Meena, I had the good fortune
of being with him..

2433
02:34:49,776 --> 02:35:00,118
..all these days and now
that luck is yours.

2434
02:35:00,787 --> 02:35:03,847
Kamalu! Kamalu! What
are you saying?

2435
02:35:05,125 --> 02:35:08,788
What are you saying? Oh no!
Don't betray me like this!

2436
02:35:09,930 --> 02:35:13,661
I don't have the strength
bear it. I can't, Kamalu!

2437
02:35:14,801 --> 02:35:16,666
I can't survive a
second without you!

2438
02:35:17,337 --> 02:35:18,668
Kamalu, I can't survive
even a second.

2439
02:35:21,074 --> 02:35:22,666
Subbu! Subbu!

2440
02:35:24,010 --> 02:35:26,672
Subbu! Subbu! My kamalu!

2441
02:35:29,349 --> 02:35:32,682
Why, dear? Why are
you so scared?

2442
02:35:33,820 --> 02:35:42,285
Look at me. I am smiling.
You must smile too.

2443
02:35:47,768 --> 02:35:49,633
Will I leave you?

2444
02:35:51,772 --> 02:35:56,766
What did you say the other day?

2445
02:35:59,980 --> 02:36:08,786
Two bodies and one soul.
Sing that once.

2446
02:36:10,323 --> 02:36:16,660
"l am the body and
you are the soul."

2447
02:36:18,131 --> 02:36:20,190
"Do the two ever separate?"

2448
02:36:22,202 --> 02:36:31,804
"Would I ever be separated
from you?"

2449
02:36:32,813 --> 02:36:38,615
"My life has been illuminated."

2450
02:36:41,154 --> 02:36:45,614
"Flower of love, after
uniting with you..

2451
02:36:45,759 --> 02:36:49,092
..my life has been illuminated."

2452
02:37:08,782 --> 02:37:16,655
Kamalu! Kamalu! Kamalu! Kamalu!
Kamalu! Kamalu!
