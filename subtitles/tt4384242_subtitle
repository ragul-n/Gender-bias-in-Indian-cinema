1
00:00:03,208 --> 00:00:07,833
<i>"Oh World famous..."</i>

2
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:15,791
<i>"...your story,
your preaching is our Bhagavad-Gita."</i>

3
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:20,958
<i>"Oh World famous..."</i>

4
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:30,041
<i>"...your greatness,
your history builds our future."</i>

5
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,750
<i>"Immortal leader."</i>

6
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:40,250
<i>"Accept our greetings."</i>

7
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:45,791
<i>"Accept our greetings."</i>

8
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:51,750
<i>"Accept our greetings."</i>

9
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:18,750
Cracker!

10
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:27,875
- May I come in, sir?
- Come in, Ramesh.

11
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:32,208
Sir.

12
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,458
The engineer fighting against
the illegal constructions of GK...

13
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,291
...GK has threatened to kill him, sir.

14
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:39,458
That officer has complained against GK.

15
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,750
Sir, GK treats our department as trash.
He is caught well.

16
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:46,291
- Ramesh.
- Sir.

17
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:47,875
Go and take immediate action.

18
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:49,458
Yes, sir!

19
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:54,166
- GK!
- Hail!

20
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:55,833
- GK!
- Hail!

21
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:57,291
- GK!
- Hail!

22
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:59,416
- GK!
- Hail!

23
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:08,750
GK!

24
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:18,833
- GK!
- Hail!

25
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:21,625
GK... he treats Central government...

26
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:24,541
...and State government with ease.

27
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:27,333
In short, from state to central...

28
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:30,333
...He is a powerful MP who
has kept politics in his fist.

29
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:34,666
They both are his namesakes. Active
partners in all his illegal businesses.

30
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:38,291
He is GK's younger brother Nani.
Position and GK are dear to him.

31
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:41,333
Do you know the good news that
I am going to tell you on this birthday?

32
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:45,291
My brother Nani is going
to enter politics very soon.

33
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:50,166
Will you adore my
brother as you adored me?

34
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:53,916
Yes, we do. We do!

35
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,208
Excuse me, sir.

36
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:02,666
I don't mind even if a cat
crosses path whenever I go out...

37
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,541
...but if policeman comes across--

38
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:10,333
You have constructing shopping
complex illegally on government land.

39
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,458
Minister has given orders to stop them.

40
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,333
You threatened to kill the
officer who is fighting this issue.

41
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:17,958
He has complained against you.
You need to come to the station once.

42
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:23,208
- What is the name?
- Engineer Sumbramanyam.

43
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,541
- Your name?
- Ramesh.

44
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:28,333
I have small work on the way. Will
you come in my vehicle or follow me?

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,541
I will come in your vehicle.

46
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:56,958
Engineer who gave complaint.

47
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:58,833
How did it happen?

48
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,250
Sand lorry hit him.

49
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,625
Sand lorry?

50
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:10,333
What is the name?

51
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,250
Ramesh.

52
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:15,416
- The minister who gave tea.
- Shyamala.

53
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:16,500
Oh.

54
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,541
Will you come in vehicle or follow me?

55
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,458
I will follow you... follow.

56
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,750
My men were constructing some complex...

57
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:33,875
...and you had given some letter
saying it is illegal.

58
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:37,708
If you give another approval
letter then our men will start the work.

59
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,583
That is the land given to social
work foundation from government.

60
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:42,708
It is not possible
to give you illegally.

61
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,000
Social service?

62
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:47,166
By giving 33 percent
reservation to ladies...

63
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,625
...you have been involved in everything.

64
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:51,875
You talk as if you are talking to a
vegetable vendor or bangle seller by...

65
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:55,833
...saying not possible and don't want.

66
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:58,750
Shyamala, I am giving you
five minutes time. Give the letter.

67
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:01,666
However you may threaten me,
I cannot do this favor to you.

68
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,500
So go home and do cooking.

69
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:06,416
Nice upma. Very tasty!

70
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,833
Lot of programs come on TV.
Watch 'Ma Inti Vanta' and 'Abhiruchi.'

71
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,750
Good time pass!

72
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:27,375
What I am saying--

73
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,541
R and D Minister has
been removed from Ministry.

74
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:39,083
A statement has been released
from Chief Minister's office.

75
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:44,416
MP GK's illegal construction site--

76
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,500
The engineer who filed
complaint is not there.

77
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:53,291
The Minister who gave
permission is not there.

78
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,500
That is your suspension order.

79
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,708
In my 15 years of political...

80
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:02,625
...I had never entered
the police station.

81
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:05,625
And no policeman entered my house.

82
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:08,416
Will you tell me to come to station?

83
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,500
I hate police.

84
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:14,125
Hey, DGP! GK.

85
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,833
Hyderabad's kind.

86
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,583
It is not possible by anybody to...

87
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:19,083
...make he lose hold on this city.

88
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:21,291
Victory is not permanent.

89
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:24,000
Today it is yours, tomorrow it is mine.

90
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,375
Good. Positive attitude.

91
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:27,625
I liked that in you.

92
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:30,333
I wanted to see a policeman
from your department who will stand...

93
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:33,333
...in front of and twirl his moustache.

94
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:36,833
Search in the map as where
will such a person is found.

95
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:40,250
Jharkhand forests! Eastern Zone!

96
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:45,333
ASP Kalyan and team
enter into the forest!

97
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,166
The area where terrorists
have kidnapped a central minister.

98
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,041
Home Minister is on line. Talk.

99
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,708
I will talk!

100
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,416
- Mr. Naidu!
- How are you?

101
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:01,500
Are you asking how I am?
Am in AC room like you?

102
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,166
It has been one week here.

103
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:05,916
Hand over their leader
to them and take me away.

104
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:09,291
<i>"You are crazy."</i>

105
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:14,958
<i>"It was fun! It was fun!"</i>

106
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,500
<i>"It was fun."</i>

107
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:19,833
Brother, we received information
about police coming.

108
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:22,041
Rascal! Will you call the police? You!

109
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,583
- Where did I call them?
- Everyone take position!

110
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,750
Go that side!

111
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,083
Brother, nobody is inside!

112
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:37,041
Hey, police! Come out!

113
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,708
Otherwise I will kill him!

114
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:41,041
When you have come, then come directly.

115
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,125
What is this child's play
by sending the empty jeep?

116
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:17,125
Hi my dear kidnappers! How are you?

117
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:19,250
Good morning, JP sir.
I am ACP Kalyan Sinha.

118
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,083
Hey!

119
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,208
JP sir, come. Let us go.

120
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,708
Where will you?
By carrying a twig on the shoulder...

121
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,541
...you have come as if you are
attending a tree plantation program.

122
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:28,291
Where is the gun?

123
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:29,500
- Catch it!
- Oh!

124
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:05,791
Don't move! Bullets will hit me!

125
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:08,791
Hey!

126
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:23,416
Come, JP sir! Mission completed.
Let us talk for ten minutes.

127
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:24,625
Sit.

128
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:30,666
You have shown your power.
You saved me very well.

129
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,416
I almost got a second life.

130
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:35,625
You should do something to me
if your second life were to be alive.

131
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:36,791
What work?

132
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:39,250
They have thrown me in
these forests after I passed IPS.

133
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:42,375
You should give me promotion
and give posting to me in Hyderabad.

134
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:46,083
On one hand there is firing, so how
can you talk of promotions and postings.

135
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,958
Let us go out without
some bullet hits us.

136
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,958
- No possible?
- No possible!

137
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,041
What is this?

138
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,791
What is your nuisance?

139
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,500
Did you come to take me...

140
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,291
...or take my dead body?

141
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:02,500
Look, sir. You want your
life and I want my promotion.

142
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,375
Look into the work fast!

143
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,625
Are you a policeman or opposition man?

144
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:09,083
Mr. Naidu! I am minister JP.

145
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,208
The policeman whom
you have sent to save me...

146
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,833
...has fought well here.

147
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:17,375
Give him promotion immediately
and post him in Hyderabad.

148
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,958
Yes, I told him. Now let us go.

149
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,333
Sir, work will not happen through phone.

150
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:25,708
If the fax copy of my transfer
comes to my phone through MMS...

151
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,708
...then only we will go out from here.

152
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:30,583
Your demands are more
than the demands of terrorists!

153
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,416
Look into that MMS matter!

154
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,250
Sir, it is bit complicated.

155
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,333
- Complicated?
- Yes.

156
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,166
I will kick you once...

157
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,583
...and then you will understand
what is complicated.

158
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,333
Sir! Sir! Send the MMS fast!

159
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:44,791
Sir, MMS has come.

160
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:48,333
What will you do by
going to Hyderabad suddenly?

161
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:51,916
One person with my life.
I should play with his life.

162
00:10:56,125 --> 00:11:00,041
Sayare!

163
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,291
<i>"Cracker!'</i>

164
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,125
Hello! Where is your DGP?

165
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,666
See there once.

166
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:31,916
Who is he?

167
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,625
Sir, he came to take joining orders.

168
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,833
Don't you have sense to salute
a senior officer when he passes by?

169
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:39,583
Leave it, uncle. What is
the need for formalities between us?

170
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,458
Come, let us go and take orders.

171
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,583
This is your joining order.

172
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:46,416
Which zone they must have given?

173
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:51,500
Oh! West zone? Jubilee Hills,
Banjara Hills, Madhapur, Costly areas!

174
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:53,458
So I can earn very well.

175
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:55,458
What will you earn?

176
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,458
Name! I will work
hard and earn name, sir.

177
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,083
- Work sincerely.
- I will do, sir.

178
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:04,916
I will work in such a way that you
will feel why I joined this department.

179
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:10,041
I mean there will be no
criminals if I work sincerely.

180
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,458
And then you will not have work.
That is what I meant.

181
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,541
Bye, sir.

182
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,583
- Sir!
- Stop it!

183
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:35,125
Do you think I am
a politician or police?

184
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:36,833
Form in a line!

185
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,791
I don't know how you
behaved with previous ACPs.

186
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,625
Henceforth how you should be...

187
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:46,208
...and how to perform duty...

188
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,583
...I will teach you.

189
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,250
- Am I clear!
- Yes, sir

190
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:51,833
- Say it loud!
- Yes, sir!

191
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,166
- Let's take the pledge!
- Yes, sir!

192
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:55,666
- Sir!
- Sir!

193
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,625
- From today...
- From today...

194
00:12:57,666 --> 00:13:00,208

197
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,125
...not for money but...

198
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,291
- Come on!
- Not for money...

199
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:12,375
...we will use for us, for
our children and future generations...

200

...we will take whatever
we get at any place...

203
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,666
Settlements, illegal business,
land grabbing...

00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,208
...we will take whatever
we get at any place...

205
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,125
Without taking any risks like
patrolling and chasings...

206
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:27,333
...we will settle down financially...

207
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,916
Without taking any risks
like patrolling and chasings...

208
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:32,291
...we will settle down financially...

209
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:35,708
...we take oath witnessed
by conscience and soul...

210
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:46,708
Why did you become so much emotional?
Are you all sincere?

211
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:48,208
No way!

212
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,458
Sir, you are the officer
who has come for us!

213
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,083
All the previous ACPs,
DCPs have filled their pockets but...

214
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:57,541
...nobody cared for
weak and poor CIs like us.

215
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,250
You are a Che Guevara for Cuba.

216
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,000
You are a Alluri for Manyam.

217
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:04,250
You are God who appeared
in khaki dress in this age of Kali.

218
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:05,208
Yes, sir.

219
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,041
Sir... our blood for vermillion--

220
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:10,875
- “Sri Surya--”
- Stop it!

221
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:14,083
How will you live when
rates are increasing so much?

222
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,625
Let all of us work hard and earn.

223
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,791
- Yes.
- One slogan for us!

224
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:22,041
If not now then when!

225
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:28,666
If not now then when!

226
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:31,916
If not now then when!

227
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,708
I liked your emotion very much.

228
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,875
Introduce me to this city in this flow.

229
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:42,083
New king of Hyderabad has come.

230
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:47,250
24 carat -like 420 boy!

231

Wonderful! Wonderful!

232
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:53,708
He has changed the station to bank.

233
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:58,166
Undercover money minded!

234
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:00,000

You took birth for us."</i>

244
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:03,875
Look my dear thieves!

245
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:07,125
We will give you protection
in all the costliest areas of city.

246
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:08,791
You commit thefts comfortably.

247
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:13,375
You should give 20 percent
from it to our police brothers.

248
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:14,875
Sir!

249
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,250
Stop it!

250
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:18,958
Not only that, use technology.

251
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,500
Facebook, twitter, etc.

252
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:22,583
What do we gain if we use technology?

253
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:25,333
Mad thief! One person on facebook
will say, I am flying to Chennai.

254
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:26,958
It means he says
he is flying to Chennai.

255
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,958
- You land in his house over here.
- Wow!

256
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,666
Another person from twitter
will say he is at Joy Alukas.

257
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:33,083
- It means he says he is at gold shop.

258
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,166

Where is the driver inside?

- Sir!

wife will get some jewellery. Go ahead!

Hey, girl! Hello!

Beat you.
Can't you hear when I am shouting?

291

Oh... sorry.

- Bye.
- Sir!

297
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:53,916
Sir, those real estate people
have started revolution on us.

298
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,208
Where?

299
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,583
Hello!

300
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:59,375
We are worried with our own
problems and try to solve them.

301
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:00,583
Why is he bothering us?

302
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,625
For the injustice that happened to you,
as chairman...

303
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,958
...and vice-chairman,.
we condemn it severely.

304
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,291
If he continues settlements like this...

305
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,625
...then we should set up laundry
shops in front of the land we sell.

306
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,208
Remove ACP! Save real estate!

307
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,583
Remove ACP!

308
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:17,416
We will not get frightened
of such warnings!

309
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:19,500
Let any number of people come.
We will finish them!

310
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:24,208
Run Milkha run!

311
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,291
Brother.

312
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:45,333
What is this preaching
of Gita early morning, sir?

313
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:47,458
Turn behind and look at the van...

314
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,125
...in 360 degrees.

315
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,375
What is this concept, sir?

316
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:58,208
What will 108 do?

317
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,458
It saves people who are in danger.

318
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,458
It saved people who meet with accident.

319
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,000
Whenever some incident occurs, it will
reach on time and drop everyone on time.

320
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:05,166
Our 801 is quite opposite to it.

321
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:08,458
It will thrash any person
who goes against our sir.

322
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,791
It will kick the person
who gives complaint.

323
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,208
If anybody acts smart, it will come
and pick up the person on time...

324
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,791
...but drops them at his will.

325
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,500
What are these schemes?

326
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,791
- Get inside!
- No!

327
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,708
Is it necessary to talk like
that when the vehicle is close?

328
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,958
It came out in flow.

329
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,708
Sir, you became police by mistake.

330
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,666
Otherwise you would have become
PM with these schemes.

331
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,125
Who will do and who will get it done?

332
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,875
Everything is Lord Krishna's plan.

333
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:35,541
You have thrashed us so
why do you blame it on Krishna.

334
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:38,333
Come! Come!

335
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,583
Why did you do
the same after telling me?

336
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:45,875
It came out in flow.

337
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,416
Sir, where else in the city
these vehicles are being run?

338
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:54,125
That ACP

339
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:55,458
What is he in front of our influence...

340
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:57,291
Where is he?

341
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:12,666
'Entire women are
shivering out of fear.' No!

342
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:17,166
They cannot even visit
a shop and buy milk packet.

343
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:18,750
Give one quarter brandy.

344
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:22,125
Brandy!

345
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:23,875
Whisky too!

346
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:25,833
Gin! Beer!

347
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:28,041
- Vodka!
- Here.

348
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:29,416
Thanks, dear.

349
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:32,958
- What about soda?
- I don't use.

350
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:41,000
You said you will tell me about liquor
smuggling if I give you alcohol, right?

351
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:42,666
- Tell me! Tell me!
- I will tell you, sister.

352
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:46,916
Take breaking news.

353
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:49,916
Why did the expression and tone change?

354
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:52,041
News is important to us.
You go ahead. Speak out!

355
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:56,833
In the hands of this Yadagiri,
a reporter from...

356
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,583
...TV5 will be raped brutally.

357
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:01,750
Cameraman escaped!

358
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:03,750
Raghu!

359
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:06,083
Even my wife too never
offered alcohol with romance?

360
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:08,375
Rascal! Will you rape
me after drinking my liquor?

361
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:10,583
Hey! Whoever tills the land,
they should get the crop...

362
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:11,916
...and whoever offers beer
should sleep on bed.

363
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:13,541
- You come!
- Run!

364
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:15,375
- Why did he become reverse like that?
- Will he not do then?

365
00:23:15,416 --> 00:23:17,083
He would have bought his
alcohol if you had given 100 rupees.

366
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:18,458
You bought it, made the drink...

367
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,875
...and offered him romantically.
So will he not commit rape?

368
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:24,625
See how he is running like a
gold medal winning athlete in Olympics?

369
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:26,583
Who will save us now?

370
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:28,291
- Our God!
- Stop it, Reddy.

371
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:30,500
Sir, because of your grace...

372
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:32,416
...I have shifted my Akruti
to corporate school from colony school.

373
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:33,000
Good.

374
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:36,416
Duplex house in Madhapur. Good
architecture. I gave advance too, sir.

375
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:37,375
Very good.

376
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,416
I-10 for mother, I-20 for father.

377
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:41,458
I-pad for brother, I-phone for sister.

378
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,875
Entire family has become I.

379
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:43,791
Superb!

380
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:45,166
But--

381
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:46,916
You are happy, right?
Why are you nagging?

382
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:49,083
Is it sufficient if we are happy?
Shouldn't you be happy?

383
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:50,708
If you too search a
beautiful girl and love her.

384
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:51,916
Keep quiet! No love for me.

385
00:23:51,958 --> 00:23:53,083
You will say like this now.

386
00:23:53,416 --> 00:23:55,041
If we make a Maniratnam's frame...

387
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:58,541
...a beautiful girl will
come running from down to up.

388
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:00,791
She is coming in real.

389
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:16,541
Sir?

390
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,166
- Sir! Greetings, sir.
- Hey!

391
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:29,833
What? What?

392
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:32,125
- No!
- I will thrash you!

393
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:33,791
- Superb!
- Did I do it well?

394
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:36,375
Hey, come! Let us go. He left.

395
00:24:36,416 --> 00:24:37,291
Okay... okay.

396
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:39,666
If you offer liquor
to every person like this.

397
00:24:39,708 --> 00:24:41,166
What is it, Reddy?

398
00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:43,958
Background looks black and
white but girl is seen in colour.

399
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,541
Has your heart beat increased?
Has your entire body become cold?

400
00:24:46,583 --> 00:24:47,791
Almost the same.

401
00:24:47,833 --> 00:24:49,250
So you had fallen in love, sir.

402
00:24:49,291 --> 00:24:50,333
- Oh!
- Yes.

403
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:51,958
We have to focus on that girl.

404
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
How will you do, sir?
She is from press and you from police!

405
00:24:54,333 --> 00:24:55,583
- Let us keep a press meet.
- Oh!

406
00:24:57,166 --> 00:24:59,291
- Have all channels come?
- Yes, sir.

407
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:02,375
TV 9, ETV 2...

408
00:25:02,416 --> 00:25:04,833
...NTV... where is our channel?

409
00:25:17,625 --> 00:25:19,500
Where is this fan effect coming from?

410
00:25:22,416 --> 00:25:24,416
- Mr. Reddy.
- Sir, I am your fan.

411
00:25:24,458 --> 00:25:26,666
First tell us why did
you keep this press meet?

412
00:25:26,708 --> 00:25:27,875
Is it about the murders
happening in city?

413
00:25:27,916 --> 00:25:29,250
Is it about illegal activities?

414
00:25:29,291 --> 00:25:30,916
- Is it about drugs racket?
- Robbery?

415
00:25:30,958 --> 00:25:33,291
- Child labour?
- Rapes?

416
00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:36,583
Mr. Reddy, these men sitting
in front are torturing me.

417
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:38,250
- See them.
- Why don't you say?

418
00:25:38,291 --> 00:25:40,708
We will tell you? Will we not
tell after calling for press meet?

419
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:43,208
All men go back and women come in front.

420
00:25:43,916 --> 00:25:45,166
What is this concept?

421
00:25:45,208 --> 00:25:46,625
RTC bus concept!

422
00:25:49,708 --> 00:25:51,041
Mr. Reddy...

423
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:52,583
Tell me.
Why did you call for press meet?

424
00:25:54,125 --> 00:25:56,500
Do you always wear jeans and t-shirts?
Do you wear saris too anytime?

425
00:25:56,541 --> 00:25:57,708
What is your domination on our girl?

426
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,541
Take her to your house after marriage
and make her wear whatever you want.

427
00:25:59,583 --> 00:26:00,875
- Oh?
- Yes.

428
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:03,708
Why did you call for press meet?

429
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,833
Will you resign from job after marriage?

430
00:26:05,875 --> 00:26:08,833
What is the need for her?
You are a man and earning well.

431
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:10,125
- Oh?
- Yes.

432
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:12,166
Hello... is it a personal
meet or press meet?

433
00:26:12,208 --> 00:26:15,333
Are we not from TV channel? Don't
we have mikes? Will you not talk to us?

434
00:26:19,416 --> 00:26:21,125
Where is this coming from?

435
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:23,500
It will not look good if
we make press people is tin vehicle.

436
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:26,375
Say something and send them.
Sweet boy... please.

437
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:27,875
Okay.

438
00:26:28,916 --> 00:26:31,708
My dear media friends.
Take my statement.

439
00:26:32,083 --> 00:26:35,458
Yesterday in Chattisgarh,
our police constable Parmesh...

440
00:26:35,791 --> 00:26:38,583
...has loved a reporter
Rita and married her.

441
00:26:39,875 --> 00:26:41,916
This is news and there
should be press meet for this!

442
00:26:41,958 --> 00:26:43,166
What does sir intend to say is...

443
00:26:43,208 --> 00:26:44,666
...by getting inspired
from Chattisgarh incident...

444
00:26:44,708 --> 00:26:46,708
...he too wishes to
marry a lady journalist.

445
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,833
Press and police
combination looks crazy.

446
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:50,125
If anybody from you is interested...

447
00:26:50,166 --> 00:26:52,333
...then you may submit applications,
sir will look into them.

448
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:55,458
Not interested! Try in Chattisgarh.

449
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:58,125
What is it with your girl?
Why is she talking so harshly?

450
00:26:58,166 --> 00:27:00,166
Will she talk smoothly
in the first meet?

451
00:27:00,208 --> 00:27:01,250
Wait for two, three meetings.

452
00:27:01,291 --> 00:27:02,666
- Oh.
- Yes.

453
00:27:02,708 --> 00:27:04,291
Isn't it?

454
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:07,666
Hello! Don't ever keep these
press meets for giving such stupid news.

455
00:27:07,708 --> 00:27:09,083
Our time is wasted!

456
00:27:10,708 --> 00:27:12,500
He is getting irritated
on small matters.

457
00:27:12,875 --> 00:27:14,583
Small small things.

458
00:27:14,625 --> 00:27:17,375
- Mr. Reddy, focus on them.
- We will do it very well.

459
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:23,166
Sir, instead of waiting for that ACP...

460
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:26,250
...if we do dieting then at least belly
will reduce. Start the meeting, sir.

461
00:27:26,291 --> 00:27:29,750
This meeting is for him.
What should we do if he is not present?

462
00:27:29,791 --> 00:27:30,500
Let him come.

463
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:32,333
Anyways ACP.

464
00:27:33,833 --> 00:27:36,958
What are you doing here?
Land dealing with DGP?

465
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,958
Yes...

466
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,708
What is it?
Didn't we come to complaint against him?

467
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:48,583
It seems one vehicle
is behind us like satellite.

468
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:49,833
Which vehicle?

469
00:27:49,875 --> 00:27:52,208
Sir, you please do your work.
We will do our work.

470
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:54,166
- What work?
- Come, I will tell you.

471
00:27:54,208 --> 00:27:55,333
- Where?
- Thai massage.

472
00:27:55,375 --> 00:27:56,291
- How much?
- Free!

473
00:27:56,333 --> 00:27:57,916
- So first for me!
- Enter inside.

474
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:02,875
ACP is coming! Sir.

475
00:28:03,541 --> 00:28:05,875
He is the king of Mysore!
Tell him to come.

476
00:28:14,666 --> 00:28:16,458
- He has come.
- Why are you so late?

477
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,708
What should I do, sir?

478
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,416
He said 30, I said 20.

479
00:28:19,458 --> 00:28:20,791
Finally settled at 25.

480
00:28:20,833 --> 00:28:24,125
Have you seen it? He is talking
about settlements in front of you.

481
00:28:24,166 --> 00:28:25,791
Why do you say settlements, sir?

482
00:28:26,041 --> 00:28:28,000
I am talking about rupees.

483
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:30,208
Do you know how the prices
of vegetables are increasing?

484
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,708
What is the cost of tomatoes?

485
00:28:36,541 --> 00:28:38,333
- Will you please sit down?
- Sure, sir.

486
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,541
Tell me your complaints.

487
00:28:43,583 --> 00:28:46,583
What should I tell you, sir? Real estate
business, partnership with thieves.

488
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:48,333
What are those schemes and nuisance?

489
00:28:48,375 --> 00:28:51,333
Sir, we are filing cases
and he is doing settlements.

490
00:28:51,791 --> 00:28:53,833
Sir, people like him shouldn't
be there in department.

491
00:28:53,875 --> 00:28:55,291
Suspend him, sir!

492
00:28:56,583 --> 00:28:58,583
Is it so easy to suspend an IPS?

493
00:28:58,625 --> 00:29:00,583
Committee should come from central,
they should conduct inquiry.

494
00:29:00,625 --> 00:29:01,791
Evidences, witnesses.

495
00:29:01,833 --> 00:29:04,250
Sir, has anyone given
a written complaint on me?

496
00:29:04,291 --> 00:29:08,208
How will we give?
There are 801 vehicles and some song.

497
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:11,416
Nobody knows where they are
coming from and where they are going.

498
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,875
Okay. Will zonal officers
working with me...

499
00:29:13,916 --> 00:29:15,833
...will anybody testify against me

500
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:18,166
- Ask our DGP Rangarao?
- Sir, how is i-20 car?

501
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:20,041
It is giving 18 per litre.

502
00:29:20,333 --> 00:29:21,916
How does he know that you have i-20?

503
00:29:21,958 --> 00:29:23,041
He has given it.

504
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:25,083
Or else ask our ACP Venkat Reddy.

505
00:29:25,125 --> 00:29:26,916
- Where is he?
- I am here.

506
00:29:26,958 --> 00:29:29,333
Hello... hope you liked your new house.

507
00:29:29,375 --> 00:29:30,541
What? House?

508
00:29:31,583 --> 00:29:32,541
When is the house warming ceremony?

509
00:29:32,583 --> 00:29:35,083
We are planning on 25th. I will come to
the office and give the card tomorrow.

510
00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:36,666
It is okay... it is okay.

511
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:38,958
In fact we all have
come to an understanding...

512
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,583
...and are working together
with honesty and sincerity.

513
00:29:41,625 --> 00:29:43,708
- What? Working?
- Sir, I mean.

514
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:44,958
While we are working...

515
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,500
- ...what are these meetings for.
- Sir!

516
00:29:46,875 --> 00:29:50,125
Sir, our lives have seen
light only after this God came.

517
00:29:50,166 --> 00:29:51,458
- Hey.
- Lord!

518
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,500
Please! Please!

519
00:29:55,541 --> 00:29:57,666
Please by keeping this
kind of time wasting meetings...

520
00:29:57,958 --> 00:29:59,458
...don't waste time for being a DGP.

521
00:30:00,416 --> 00:30:01,583
By the way, who is he?

522
00:30:01,625 --> 00:30:05,708
If the three lions stand for honesty,
sincerity and justice...

523
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,541
...the fourth lion that is not seen.

524
00:30:08,208 --> 00:30:10,500
Agni! Yes.
Fire!

525
00:30:12,333 --> 00:30:13,583
Bye, sir.

526
00:30:26,708 --> 00:30:30,708
He has come to this city
with a different intention.

527
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:40,708
GK! Good morning.

528
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:41,625
Come, Home.

529
00:30:41,666 --> 00:30:42,458
- Subba Reddy.
- Sir.

530
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,166
Wait.

531
00:30:43,625 --> 00:30:45,541
Is it the plate from which
GK sir has eaten?

532
00:30:45,583 --> 00:30:46,458
Yes, sir.

533
00:30:47,666 --> 00:30:49,000
What is that greed?

534
00:30:49,041 --> 00:30:50,666
If you ask then they
will give another plate.

535
00:30:50,708 --> 00:30:53,541
Raja, it is not that there
are no more idlis in this house...

536
00:30:53,583 --> 00:30:55,083
...or that I don't have money.

537
00:30:55,125 --> 00:30:59,583
It is to symbolically say that we all
are living by eating GK's leftover food.

538
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:03,541
Uncle, call from Bhanumathi.
Should I send Qualis or Innova?

539
00:31:03,583 --> 00:31:05,083
Hell with her!

540
00:31:05,125 --> 00:31:07,750
She is not taking my call.
Is she in touch with you?

541
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:10,416
Tell him.
Tell him the entire personal matters.

542
00:31:10,458 --> 00:31:12,833
- Hi, Chevibothu uncle!
- Hi, Nani.

543
00:31:12,875 --> 00:31:14,500
See there once.

544
00:31:21,541 --> 00:31:23,791
Hey, what are you doing on
roads at midnight after drinking?

545
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:25,541
On police uniform.

546
00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:30,958
Hey! Did you beat police?

547
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,458
Raja, why do you feel so
happy as if he secured a state rank?

548
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,833
DGP has filed the case.

549
00:31:35,875 --> 00:31:37,500
I have settled the matter.

550
00:31:37,541 --> 00:31:39,291
Make our boy--

551
00:31:39,333 --> 00:31:40,916
Tell me so that I understand!

552
00:31:40,958 --> 00:31:43,875
Raja, make our boy say sorry to police.

553
00:31:46,041 --> 00:31:48,375
We gave him minister's post
by licking everyone's feet at centre.

554
00:31:48,416 --> 00:31:50,875
So why does he tell us to say
sorry instead of doing favour to us?

555
00:31:51,458 --> 00:31:53,958
<i>"Even if we make a
dog sit on golden throne..."</i>

556
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,083
<i>"...it will still behave like a dog!"</i>

557
00:31:56,125 --> 00:31:57,833
What is the confusion?
Sumathi or Bhanumathi?

558
00:31:57,875 --> 00:31:59,291
- You!
- No!

559
00:32:00,958 --> 00:32:03,000
Brother is MP and
uncle is Home Minister!

560
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:04,666
Boys committed some mistake
so instead of covering it...

561
00:32:04,708 --> 00:32:05,791
...why do you complicate it.

562
00:32:05,833 --> 00:32:07,916
Is this the assurance that
you give to our future generations?

563
00:32:07,958 --> 00:32:09,125
Phone... phone... give the phone...

564
00:32:09,166 --> 00:32:10,375
- I will get him sacked!
- Raja, wait.

565
00:32:10,416 --> 00:32:13,416
Will you get me sacked?
Will you really do it?

566
00:32:13,458 --> 00:32:16,250
Am I such a fool? Cannot I save my post?

567
00:32:17,458 --> 00:32:19,583
- Raja and Nani! Beat me!
- Uncle.

568
00:32:19,625 --> 00:32:22,291
Beat me! Beat me! Beat me!

569
00:32:22,333 --> 00:32:25,250
GK, your brother beat Home Minister.

570
00:32:25,291 --> 00:32:29,000
Will a person who beats the
Home Minister cannot a beat policeman?

571
00:32:29,041 --> 00:32:31,625
Is it a big case?
Should we take tension for it?

572
00:32:31,666 --> 00:32:34,500
Am I not there who eats your leftover?

573
00:32:34,541 --> 00:32:36,791
Shall I talk to the DGP?

574
00:32:37,458 --> 00:32:39,458
- Tell me, sir.
- Last night our policemen...

575
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,458
...have thrashed our
boys after drinking heavily.

576
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,333
Just now I have learnt about it.
Suspend them for two weeks.

577
00:32:45,375 --> 00:32:46,208
Sir, it is--

578
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:49,041
Suspend them! They will sit at home
and take rest with wife and children!

579
00:32:50,041 --> 00:32:51,333
DGP.

580
00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:55,875
My dream is to see my
brother as a political leader.

581
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:58,791
If anybody comes in between,
I will get hurt.

582
00:33:00,708 --> 00:33:02,291
Better luck next time.

583
00:33:03,333 --> 00:33:04,708
Small doubt.

584
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:07,083
Raja, why are you so
much angry with policemen?

585
00:33:07,125 --> 00:33:08,916
Why is a cat angry on rat?

586
00:33:09,833 --> 00:33:11,375
Why is a tiger angry on deer?

587
00:33:12,625 --> 00:33:15,500
They will hunt them
and satisfy their hunger.

588
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:20,875
Nature instinct.
It is related to nature...

589
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:22,791
...and also a nature behaviour.

590
00:33:24,041 --> 00:33:26,208
I hate police.

591
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,875
What shall we do now, Reddy?

592
00:33:34,916 --> 00:33:36,791
If we raid some rave party then...

593
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:39,083
...we will pay our chit fund
money with the money we get there.

594
00:33:39,125 --> 00:33:41,375
Stop it, Reddy.
You have become very commercial.

595
00:33:41,708 --> 00:33:43,708
See how romantic the climate is.

596
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:44,666
I want my darling.

597
00:33:44,708 --> 00:33:46,166
How will you meet
your darling right now?

598
00:33:46,208 --> 00:33:47,041
We will call for press meet.

599
00:33:47,083 --> 00:33:48,958
What will you call press
meet for at 12 o'clock midnight?

600
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,166
Two thieves are caught red-handed
while stealing inside the ATP.

601
00:33:51,208 --> 00:33:52,625
From where will two
thieves come right now?

602
00:33:52,666 --> 00:33:54,291
Hello!

603
00:33:57,666 --> 00:34:00,916
We are still making rounds of Apollo
for the pains from your 801 thrashing.

604
00:34:00,958 --> 00:34:03,708
Sir, our lives will get ruined if you
now talk about thieves and press meets.

605
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,333
Reddy, motivate them a little.

606
00:34:05,375 --> 00:34:07,500
Are they writing entrance
exam so that we motive them?

607
00:34:07,541 --> 00:34:08,541
They are going to central jail.

608
00:34:08,583 --> 00:34:09,916
Is it okay if we put masks?

609
00:34:09,958 --> 00:34:10,750
What masks?

610
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:12,625
Call the press!

611
00:34:20,875 --> 00:34:22,166
Sir, how did the robbery happen in ATM?

612
00:34:22,208 --> 00:34:24,958
Hey, why are you rushing to him?
What do you want to know? Go away!

613
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,500
Only those channel people should speak.

614
00:34:26,541 --> 00:34:28,083
- Come, madam.
- You come.

615
00:34:28,125 --> 00:34:29,333
Sir, how come there is so much
change in them?

616
00:34:29,375 --> 00:34:29,958
It is nothing.

617
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,708
Our 801 went around in their
area for one hour yesterday.

618
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:32,875
They have crushed like flour.

619
00:34:32,916 --> 00:34:34,791
Brother-in-law,
vehicle is taking press people too.

620
00:34:35,083 --> 00:34:36,416
Remove the masks of thieves.

621
00:34:36,708 --> 00:34:37,875
Why should we remove the masks, madam.

622
00:34:37,916 --> 00:34:39,500
You leave out people
involved in big scams...

623
00:34:39,541 --> 00:34:40,958
...but will you catch us for
committing small thefts.

624
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,416
- Yes.
- Why don't you talk, brother-in-law?

625
00:34:42,458 --> 00:34:44,041
What should I talk? There are cameras.

626
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:45,333
My God! I don't know anything!

627
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:46,708
How much amount is stolen from ATM?

628
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:48,458
Yes, Reddy?
Why is your girl so irritating?

629
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,166
Will she not be like that? Her
job is like that. She has many tensions.

630
00:34:51,208 --> 00:34:52,208
- Oh?
- Yes!

631
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:54,041
I know you are trying for me.

632
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:57,166
However you may try,
I will not fall for you.

633
00:34:57,208 --> 00:34:59,708
What is it with your girl?
How can she not co-operate little bit?

634
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:02,000
- How will I know the details?
- Why will she tell them.

635
00:35:02,041 --> 00:35:04,250
You are a police officer.
Use your brain and know them.

636
00:35:04,291 --> 00:35:05,625
- Oh?
- Yes!

637
00:35:05,666 --> 00:35:06,916
Last night we caught a thief, right?

638
00:35:06,958 --> 00:35:08,416
Who? The one who
stole one kilogram gold?

639
00:35:08,458 --> 00:35:10,375
Give half kilogram
from it to this fatty.

640
00:35:11,833 --> 00:35:14,250
Flat number four, house number 104.

641
00:35:14,291 --> 00:35:15,500
Dilsukhnagar, Hyderabad.

642
00:35:15,541 --> 00:35:17,750
Only her sister and
brother-in-law stay in her house.

643
00:35:17,791 --> 00:35:20,375
Her sister is mad and
passionate about police.

644
00:35:20,416 --> 00:35:21,708
That's why they got her married
to a big businessman...

645
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:23,750
...by lying to her saying he is police.

646
00:35:23,791 --> 00:35:25,500
There she said she will live with him...

647
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:27,791
...only if he wears uniform
on Saturdays on Sundays.

648
00:35:27,833 --> 00:35:31,000
If you go to their house then
she will get you married to her.

649
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:32,708
Sir, my gold.

650
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:34,708
Thief is caught but not the gold.

651
00:35:37,625 --> 00:35:38,750
Mr. Reddy.

652
00:35:38,791 --> 00:35:40,458
What is our immediate action?

653
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,833
Well, it will be beneficial if we
go for her elder sister by leaving her.

654
00:35:45,791 --> 00:35:47,875
Well said, Reddy! Well said!

655
00:35:48,333 --> 00:35:50,750
Mahi! Darling Mahi!

656
00:35:50,791 --> 00:35:52,833
- Where are you, dear?
- Who are you?

657
00:35:52,875 --> 00:35:55,625
I love your sister.

658
00:35:55,666 --> 00:35:57,208
How dare you! Do you love my sister?

659
00:35:57,250 --> 00:36:00,416
- Sir is ACP!
- Brother-in-law?

660
00:36:00,666 --> 00:36:01,916
Come. Come. Sit.

661
00:36:01,958 --> 00:36:04,583
Sister-in-law,
nasty furniture in this costly house?

662
00:36:04,625 --> 00:36:05,750
- Mr. Reddy!
- We will change it.

663
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,250
Old TV in a modern showcase?

664
00:36:09,291 --> 00:36:10,791
Change it! Change it!

665
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,625
Why is your beautiful neck empty?

666
00:36:14,916 --> 00:36:17,750
Brother-in-law,
we have another house in Langer house.

667
00:36:17,791 --> 00:36:19,625
- That doesn't fall under our area.
- It is okay.

668
00:36:19,666 --> 00:36:21,208
Brother-in-law, first you sit.

669
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:22,666
I should give treat you well.

670
00:36:22,708 --> 00:36:24,583
What will you take?
Coffee? Tea? Cold drink?

671
00:36:24,625 --> 00:36:26,416
Dear!

672
00:36:26,458 --> 00:36:28,083
Yes, Kantham?

673
00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:32,541
Don't you face problems if
you go out in uniform like this?

674
00:36:32,583 --> 00:36:35,750
Why will I not face problems? Recently
I went to forests for eat forest food...

675
00:36:35,791 --> 00:36:37,041
...maoists attacked me.

676
00:36:37,583 --> 00:36:40,083
Kantham, it is very hot in the kitchen.

677
00:36:40,125 --> 00:36:41,166
Should I remove the dress?

678
00:36:41,208 --> 00:36:43,875
Sacred thread is heavy.
Should I remove it?

679
00:36:43,916 --> 00:36:46,208
Sister, pack the lunch box soon.

680
00:36:52,291 --> 00:36:54,875
Sister, why did he come home directly?

681
00:36:54,916 --> 00:36:56,750
- Hey, go away from here!
- Keep quiet.

682
00:36:56,791 --> 00:36:59,041
Brother-in-law came home for the first
time? Why do you tell him to go out?

683
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:00,791
- Go and talk to her for some time.
- Ah!

684
00:37:00,833 --> 00:37:02,083
Come! Come!

685
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,083
- What is this, sister?
- Wrong, bujji.

686
00:37:04,125 --> 00:37:05,333
Why should I talk to a stranger?

687
00:37:05,375 --> 00:37:07,333
- I understood.
- What is this?

688
00:37:07,583 --> 00:37:08,500
- Click!
- Do you have any sense?

689
00:37:08,541 --> 00:37:09,333
- Selfie!
- Hey!

690
00:37:09,708 --> 00:37:10,708
What the hell!

691
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:12,375
This pose is good!

692
00:37:13,708 --> 00:37:15,375
Go out I say!

693
00:37:15,416 --> 00:37:17,416
Otherwise I will do a live
show in our channel by saying...

694
00:37:17,458 --> 00:37:20,541
...you are harassing
me and get you thrashed.

695
00:37:20,583 --> 00:37:22,583
- Sister-in-law.
- Wait, brother-in-law.

696
00:37:22,625 --> 00:37:24,041
What will you do?

697
00:37:24,083 --> 00:37:25,708
You have only one channel?

698
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:27,875
There are 20 channels against you.

699
00:37:27,916 --> 00:37:31,250
Brother-in-law and I will sit
on live show and you have pinched him...

700
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:32,458
...bit him...

701
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,750
...and touched him. What will you do?

702
00:37:35,916 --> 00:37:36,625
Sister.

703
00:37:36,666 --> 00:37:38,458
Sister-in-law, I want
to go to restaurant with your sister.

704
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,250
- Take her.
- She will not come with me.

705
00:37:41,291 --> 00:37:42,791
She will come with family.

706
00:37:43,166 --> 00:37:44,125
Will you eat burger?

707
00:37:44,166 --> 00:37:47,000
Sister, when there so
many chairs empty in front...

708
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:49,875
...so why should we sit
close and tight like this.

709
00:37:49,916 --> 00:37:51,708
It will be good if
we all sit and eat other.

710
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:53,875
It will not look good
if we sit far away and eat.

711
00:37:53,916 --> 00:37:55,125
- Yes, brother-in-law?
- Yes.

712
00:37:55,166 --> 00:37:56,000
Well said.

713
00:37:59,166 --> 00:38:00,583
Come home. I will see you.

714
00:38:04,583 --> 00:38:06,541
Police uncle, autograph.

715
00:38:11,541 --> 00:38:13,625
Tell one dialogue too.

716
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:15,583
Policeman will go to police station...

717
00:38:15,625 --> 00:38:17,291
...and not to post office
if he gets transferred.

718
00:38:17,333 --> 00:38:19,208
Mother!

719
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:20,833
Hi, friends! Now we are announcing...

720
00:38:20,875 --> 00:38:23,250
...'Most Visiting Best Couple
of the year' goes to...

721
00:38:23,291 --> 00:38:24,875
...Mr. Kalyan and Mahathi!

722
00:38:26,458 --> 00:38:28,666
How come I am most visiting?

723
00:38:28,708 --> 00:38:30,500
I came here for the first time.

724
00:38:33,708 --> 00:38:35,541
Yes! Yes! Clap for them!

725
00:38:45,458 --> 00:38:46,333
Hey!

726
00:38:46,375 --> 00:38:47,416
- She is going.
- Mahi!

727
00:38:49,083 --> 00:38:54,083
<i>"Oh my oh my baby!
Don't leave me and go!"</i>

728
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:59,500
<i>""Oh my oh my baby!
Just smile and give me a look."</i>

729
00:38:59,791 --> 00:39:01,750
Though so much poetry
came out with deep feeling...

730
00:39:01,791 --> 00:39:03,458
...she didn't even turn back and see.

731
00:39:08,583 --> 00:39:10,291
Thanks, Reddy.

732
00:39:11,791 --> 00:39:13,666
<i>"Hey, girl! Don't make faces."</i>

733
00:39:13,708 --> 00:39:16,500
<i>"Don't hurt my live,
don't burn my heart."</i>

734
00:39:16,791 --> 00:39:18,666
<i>"Hey, girl! Don't snub me."</i>

735
00:39:18,708 --> 00:39:21,625
<i>"Don't get irritated,
don't turn your eyes red."</i>

736
00:39:21,916 --> 00:39:26,500
<i>"Show me a teaspoonful of sympathy.
Share fistful of love."</i>

737
00:39:26,916 --> 00:39:31,291
<i>"Put a basketful of love in my account."</i>

738
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,166
<i>"Millimeter length of smile is enough."</i>

739
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:37,000
<i>"Centimeter length of smile is enough."</i>

740
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:41,791
<i>"We should reduce the miles
of distance between you and me."</i>

741
00:39:41,833 --> 00:39:46,791
<i>"I will give you flowers,
I will worship you. I beg you. Love me."</i>

742
00:39:51,916 --> 00:39:56,875
<i>"I will give you money, I will treat
you as a queen. I beg you. Love me."</i>

743
00:40:32,333 --> 00:40:37,333
<i>"Like the kohl in your eyes,
I will read your entire dreams."</i>

744
00:40:37,375 --> 00:40:42,375
<i>"I will remain like
the sound of your bangles."</i>

745
00:40:42,416 --> 00:40:47,458
<i>"I will tell you sweet things
by becoming your earlobes."</i>

746
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:52,458
<i>"I will become betel leaves
on your lips and share the sweetness."</i>

747
00:40:52,875 --> 00:40:57,541
<i>"I will draw your photo like a dream,
I will guard you like a fence."</i>

748
00:40:57,875 --> 00:41:02,541
<i>"I will make our story
special from others."</i>

749
00:41:02,875 --> 00:41:07,958
<i>"I will remain like a tattoo,
I will become the promise."</i>

750
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,666
<i>"I will make you walk
by becoming your toe ring."</i>

751
00:41:12,708 --> 00:41:17,708
<i>"I will give you flowers,
I will worship you. I beg you. Love me."</i>

752
00:41:28,291 --> 00:41:30,375
Sir, she felt shy.
It means she had given the signal.

753
00:41:30,416 --> 00:41:31,208
Yes, girl?

754
00:41:32,791 --> 00:41:37,791
<i>"I will become the rain
of love in summer for you."</i>

755
00:41:37,833 --> 00:41:42,833
<i>"I will become the
warmth hug in this cold."</i>

756
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:47,916
<i>"I will become the first ray
of light at dawn and wake up."</i>

757
00:41:47,958 --> 00:41:52,958
<i>"I will come as moonlight
for you in dark."</i>

758
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:57,916
<i>"I will hear you before you call me,
I will be seen before you think of me."</i>

759
00:41:58,291 --> 00:42:03,041
<i>"I will become love
to your unseen life."</i>

760
00:42:03,375 --> 00:42:08,500
<i>"If there a is sound
for a heartbeat."</i>

761
00:42:08,541 --> 00:42:13,125
<i>"I will become breathe to your wishes."</i>

762
00:42:13,166 --> 00:42:18,208
<i>"I will give you flowers,
I will worship you. I beg you. Love me."</i>

763
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:28,666
<i>"I will give you money, I will treat
you as a queen. I beg you. Love me."</i>

764
00:42:30,708 --> 00:42:32,750
About that ACP--

765
00:42:34,625 --> 00:42:37,875
Hi,  DGP. If there is
TV near you then turn it on.

766
00:42:39,375 --> 00:42:41,750
The GK complex
having many litigations...

767
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:43,583
...is finally opened morning.

768
00:42:43,625 --> 00:42:47,500
Police tried to stop its construction
but it has done the opening.

769
00:42:50,166 --> 00:42:52,125
GK sir is a very good human being.

770
00:42:52,166 --> 00:42:55,333
I wish he constructs many malls like
this. He will always enjoy my support.

771
00:42:57,125 --> 00:43:01,541
ACP met me today morning and
told me to give sweet news to you.

772
00:43:01,583 --> 00:43:03,500
ACP is not a stranger.

773
00:43:03,875 --> 00:43:06,250
He is your real son.

774
00:43:10,791 --> 00:43:13,541
Whatever move you make from now...

775
00:43:14,083 --> 00:43:15,916
...I will give you counter
with your son.

776
00:43:15,958 --> 00:43:17,916
Good afternoon, DGP sir.

777
00:43:24,291 --> 00:43:26,458
- Take sweets, sir.
- Why?

778
00:43:26,833 --> 00:43:28,375
GK sir's mall is opened.

779
00:43:28,416 --> 00:43:29,625
Sir, there is a new enthusiasm
in the department...

780
00:43:29,666 --> 00:43:31,250
...after knowing that DGP
sir is your father.

781
00:43:31,291 --> 00:43:32,500
- Oh?
- Yes!

782
00:43:33,625 --> 00:43:35,708
But why is sir looking dull.

783
00:43:36,041 --> 00:43:39,791
Sir, take care of your health. You
will hear many such sweet news from now.

784
00:43:39,833 --> 00:43:41,083
Bye, sir.

785
00:43:52,208 --> 00:43:54,458
Sir, we traced his records.

786
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,375
He changed his name
to Kalyan school and studied...

787
00:43:56,416 --> 00:43:58,666
...in an orphan school in Uttar Pradesh.

788
00:43:58,708 --> 00:44:01,041
His childhood photo
is coming through fax.

789
00:44:07,458 --> 00:44:10,291
See that star! There! There!

790
00:44:11,333 --> 00:44:13,041
See how many colours are there!

791
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:18,458
- Mother, will father come?
- Yes, son.

792
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,916
Yes, sister? Didn't sir come home yet?

793
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:22,958
Is he working on festivals too?

794
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,875
We too are doing jobs and are
happily spending time with children.

795
00:44:25,916 --> 00:44:28,541
As if he alone is serving the country!

796
00:44:35,625 --> 00:44:37,166
- Come early in the morning.
- Okay, sir.

797
00:44:41,125 --> 00:44:43,250
Why didn't you bring
crackers to the boy?

798
00:44:43,291 --> 00:44:44,416
Oh!

799
00:44:45,375 --> 00:44:47,416
Sorry, dear. Shall we go and buy now?

800
00:44:47,458 --> 00:44:49,375
- I don't want!
- Son!

801
00:44:52,375 --> 00:44:53,500
Mother!

802
00:45:00,583 --> 00:45:03,125
Father is like a friend or guide to son.

803
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,750
But for me,
he remained like a photo in album...

804
00:45:07,166 --> 00:45:08,791
...and signature in progress card.

805
00:45:09,541 --> 00:45:12,875
Only mother would stay with
me in both happiness and sadness.

806
00:45:13,208 --> 00:45:14,875
So, you study. I will be back soon.

807
00:45:14,916 --> 00:45:16,958
- Oh!
- What happened, mother?

808
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:18,416
What happened, mother?

809
00:45:18,458 --> 00:45:19,375
That squad---

810
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:20,791
Father! Father! Mother fell down.

811
00:45:20,833 --> 00:45:22,083
We need to take her
to hospital immediately.

812
00:45:22,125 --> 00:45:23,958
Come soon, father. Please, father.

813
00:45:24,875 --> 00:45:26,458
Sir, situation is very serious there.

814
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:27,791
We should go immediately.

815
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:29,791
- Gurunatham.
- Sir.

816
00:45:30,833 --> 00:45:32,416
- My wife is undergoing pains.
- Sir.

817
00:45:32,458 --> 00:45:33,916
Take her to the hospital urgently.

818
00:45:33,958 --> 00:45:35,166
- You go with the boy.
- Okay, sir.

819
00:45:35,208 --> 00:45:36,625
- I will come in half an hour.
- Okay, sir!

820
00:45:38,208 --> 00:45:40,833
Come on! Move! Get in!

821
00:45:50,958 --> 00:45:52,083
Ah!

822
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:53,458
Mother! Mother!

823
00:45:56,291 --> 00:45:59,083
Condition is very critical. If we
don't perform operation immediately...

824
00:45:59,125 --> 00:46:00,458
...then there is a danger
to both mother and child.

825
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,250
Make arrangements for operation money.

826
00:46:02,291 --> 00:46:04,916
That day father was not
there to stand by my side.

827
00:46:05,333 --> 00:46:08,416
I didn't have money
to get mother treated.

828
00:46:08,958 --> 00:46:11,083
Sorry, son.
Both mother and child have died.

829
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:35,125
I was not in a position
to go to my wife that day.

830
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:38,250
He was too young to
understand even if I tell him.

831
00:46:39,041 --> 00:46:40,958
He left the house
because of anger on me.

832
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:44,083
As a police officer,
your duty was correct.

833
00:46:44,458 --> 00:46:46,166
As a son, his grief was correct.

834
00:46:46,458 --> 00:46:48,916
Sir, he will understand you one day.

835
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,625
He is coming. Is the camera ready?

836
00:47:00,666 --> 00:47:02,416
Maa TV camera. Perfect!

837
00:47:02,458 --> 00:47:03,958
We should catch him red-handed! Come!

838
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:04,875
Hello!

839
00:47:04,916 --> 00:47:06,833
We are searching for you since morning.
You are found now.

840
00:47:06,875 --> 00:47:08,166
- What is the matter?
- We have changed.

841
00:47:08,208 --> 00:47:09,541
We have joined your route. That's it.

842
00:47:09,583 --> 00:47:11,041
- Here is your share.
- Okay.

843
00:47:11,375 --> 00:47:12,916
Sir, it is okay... take it.

844
00:47:13,416 --> 00:47:15,416
- What happened to him?
- Sir, he is practicing yoga these days.

845
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:17,041
Leave him. Sir, you take it.

846
00:47:17,083 --> 00:47:18,083
No!

847
00:47:18,125 --> 00:47:20,708
Sir, our feelings will get
hurt if you don't take. Take it, sir.

848
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,166
Mr. Reddy, you take cash
from him and cash from him.

849
00:47:23,416 --> 00:47:25,458
Sir! How did you find out?

850
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:27,791
Hey, you brought
camera from channel guy.

851
00:47:27,833 --> 00:47:30,250
Is it necessary to bring cap too?
Waste fellow!

852
00:47:30,666 --> 00:47:32,375
- Maa--
- Rascal!

853
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:34,541
Sir! Is our van moving
in these surroundings?

854
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,083
Escape?

855
00:47:37,166 --> 00:47:38,750
Greetings, sir. I am Kavya's father.

856
00:47:38,791 --> 00:47:40,208
Hello, sir. Where is Kavya?

857
00:47:44,625 --> 00:47:46,375
- What is all this?
- Computers opening.

858
00:47:46,625 --> 00:47:49,250
Mr. Reddy, we would have called
Samatha for Tamanna for opening.

859
00:47:49,291 --> 00:47:50,541
They are asking for money.

860
00:47:50,583 --> 00:47:52,041
Oh no need! We will do it.

861
00:47:54,208 --> 00:47:55,375
Wow!

862
00:47:57,750 --> 00:48:00,208
- Who are these children?
- Orphans, sir.

863
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:01,666
They too are handicapped like her.

864
00:48:02,125 --> 00:48:04,416
They too should lead their
lives confidently like her so...

865
00:48:04,458 --> 00:48:05,958
...she adopted them.

866
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,458
She is getting them
educated with her earnings.

867
00:48:17,375 --> 00:48:19,208
Sir! Sir!

868
00:48:21,416 --> 00:48:24,333
Yes, Reddy? I think her character
will disturb our character.

869
00:48:24,875 --> 00:48:26,000
Come. Come.

870
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:28,666
We can make more money
if we take IG Kashi too with us.

871
00:48:29,666 --> 00:48:32,041
Join him! Join the entire
department of the state.

872
00:48:32,083 --> 00:48:33,583
- Okay, sir.
- Shut up

873
00:48:37,333 --> 00:48:40,625
Hey, why did DGP sir came
searching for me at this hour?

874
00:48:41,291 --> 00:48:42,916
Sir is duty minded.

875
00:48:43,916 --> 00:48:46,625
Your father wanted to
talk to you for one minute so--

876
00:48:47,083 --> 00:48:48,708
I waited for many years by thinking...

877
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:50,208
...it is sufficient if he talks
for one second.

878
00:48:51,791 --> 00:48:53,500
If you listen to me once--

879
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:56,375
- What happened that day was--
- Look, Mr. Kashi.

880
00:48:56,416 --> 00:48:58,208
I became police with
the anger against sir.

881
00:48:58,458 --> 00:49:01,750
I came here with the anger on sir.
I met GK with the anger on sir.

882
00:49:02,291 --> 00:49:04,291
I will do a lot with the anger on sir.

883
00:49:04,833 --> 00:49:05,916
Convey it!

884
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:10,833
Yes?

885
00:49:40,208 --> 00:49:42,416
Mother, this will look
good for sister, right?

886
00:49:42,458 --> 00:49:44,500
How do you know that
sister will be born?

887
00:49:44,541 --> 00:49:46,250
I will have sister.

888
00:50:05,125 --> 00:50:09,666
Because of you, I lost my
sister immediately after her birth.

889
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,708
God has given this
relationship to me again.

890
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:15,125
I am very happy.

891
00:50:15,166 --> 00:50:19,208
You don't enter my life again
and make me lose that happiness.

892
00:50:27,916 --> 00:50:29,375
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

893
00:50:29,625 --> 00:50:30,666
Climate is superb!

894
00:50:30,708 --> 00:50:33,208
If we have a girl in this
weather then it will be even better.

895
00:50:34,541 --> 00:50:37,708
There are software companies all around.
Infosys, Infotech.

896
00:50:38,041 --> 00:50:40,416
There will be many figures on road.

897
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,083
- Hey! Stop!
- Hey! Leave me!

898
00:50:53,333 --> 00:50:55,500
- Leave me! Please!
- Come!

899
00:50:56,125 --> 00:50:57,250
Please!

900
00:51:14,083 --> 00:51:17,750
Handle this case carefully before
the pressure from media builds us.

901
00:51:17,791 --> 00:51:19,208
Okay, sir.

902
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:21,541
- Give me update regularly.
- Yes, sir.

903
00:51:21,583 --> 00:51:24,833
<i>"My eyes are saying I love you."</i>

904
00:51:24,875 --> 00:51:28,041
You said you will leave me
if I talk for ten minutes. Tell me.

905
00:51:29,791 --> 00:51:32,666
It is okay for Sister and
brother-in-law. If you too say okay...

906
00:51:32,708 --> 00:51:34,833
...we will get married in Hitex
and arrange reception in Hyatt.

907
00:51:34,875 --> 00:51:38,375
I want to become a maoist
urgently and kill you with landmine.

908
00:51:38,416 --> 00:51:42,208
Oh! Beauty of girls' becomes
double when they talk like rebels.

909
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:44,000
- Go to hell!
- Yes, Reddy?

910
00:51:44,041 --> 00:51:45,291
Is your girl in love with someone?

911
00:51:45,333 --> 00:51:47,166
Talk with respect!
What do you think of our girl?

912
00:51:47,208 --> 00:51:48,666
What is our caste and clan?

913
00:51:50,541 --> 00:51:52,666
Yes. I am in love with a boy.

914
00:51:52,708 --> 00:51:54,291
- Girl!
- Who is he?

915
00:51:54,333 --> 00:51:56,250
- I will not tell you.
- Tell me who he is.

916
00:51:56,291 --> 00:51:57,583
I will not interfere with you at all.

917
00:52:02,791 --> 00:52:04,375
Tsunami star Subash!

918
00:52:05,833 --> 00:52:07,458
I met him at press meet recently.

919
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:11,875
First we started talking
and then we became one. Okay?

920
00:52:18,541 --> 00:52:21,250
- Mr. Reddy, what is his bio-data?
- He is a old NRI.

921
00:52:21,291 --> 00:52:23,250
He is thinking of dollar
dreams at this age.

922
00:52:23,291 --> 00:52:26,458
He is torturing the public
by making stupid movies every Friday.

923
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:28,208
Where can we find this bare body guy?

924
00:52:29,208 --> 00:52:30,541
Start camera! Action!

925
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:36,541
- Okay?
- Sir, shot okay!

926
00:52:36,583 --> 00:52:38,916
Sir! Superb, sir! Excellent!

927
00:52:38,958 --> 00:52:40,333
- Superb fight!
- Sir!

928
00:52:40,375 --> 00:52:41,125
Marvelous!
Excellent!

929
00:52:41,166 --> 00:52:42,458
- Superb, sir!
- Shut up!

930
00:52:42,875 --> 00:52:45,250
Is it this dust,
mud and action all the time?

931
00:52:45,833 --> 00:52:47,875
- Isn't there romance?
- Romance?

932
00:52:47,916 --> 00:52:49,291
Recently you said hug.

933
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:51,333
Your back suffered catch when
we planned it and you fell on bed.

934
00:52:51,375 --> 00:52:53,750
Back will not suffer pain every time.

935
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,750
I am using medicines.

936
00:52:55,791 --> 00:52:57,333
Follow directors.

937
00:52:57,375 --> 00:53:00,666
Jayanth made Pawan do it, Puri
made Mahesh do it and you make me do it.

938
00:53:00,708 --> 00:53:02,208
What is it?

939
00:53:03,333 --> 00:53:04,583
Lip lock!

940
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:09,750
What is it with her? She is vomiting
when I didn't go anything to her.

941
00:53:09,791 --> 00:53:12,708
We shouldn't encourage young directors.
They are attracting the heroines.

942
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:13,541
Good morning, Babu.

943
00:53:13,583 --> 00:53:15,083
Yes, producer. What is the matter?

944
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:17,875
I heard you gave the title of
'Kothimir' to our movie. It is not good.

945
00:53:17,916 --> 00:53:18,708
Shut up!

946
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:21,416
They have watch Prakash's 'Mirchi'. Will
they not watch Subhash's 'Kothimir'?

947
00:53:21,458 --> 00:53:23,791
Use the phone if you are idle,
don't use brain. Get lost!

948
00:53:24,541 --> 00:53:26,791
- Yes, mister?
- Sir, it is--

949
00:53:26,833 --> 00:53:27,875
- Hey, Ramana!
- Sir.

950
00:53:27,916 --> 00:53:30,333
Why did NTR and Bunny shake like that...

951
00:53:30,375 --> 00:53:32,500
...because of my dance
in pub last night?

952
00:53:32,541 --> 00:53:34,875
You are old so they must have
got frightened by seeing your shape.

953
00:53:36,291 --> 00:53:39,708
I mean he thinks they
are frightened of your dance.

954
00:53:41,083 --> 00:53:43,416
His explanation and
your expression don't sync.

955
00:53:43,458 --> 00:53:45,041
- Pack up!
- Sir! Sir!

956
00:53:45,083 --> 00:53:47,166
- See this photo once.
- Look into my eyes.

957
00:53:47,208 --> 00:53:49,541
<i>"Mesmerizing eyes."</i>

958
00:53:49,583 --> 00:53:51,750
<i>"Look into them slowly."</i>

959
00:53:51,791 --> 00:53:54,375
- Who is this girl?
- I love this girl.

960
00:53:54,416 --> 00:53:57,166
In order to escape from me,
she says she loves you.

961
00:53:57,208 --> 00:53:59,750
If you say no then I will continue.

962
00:53:59,791 --> 00:54:01,916
Open offer! Why will I miss it?

963
00:54:01,958 --> 00:54:04,041
How can you love my lover?

964
00:54:04,708 --> 00:54:06,166
Ah!

965
00:54:06,625 --> 00:54:10,375
Mister, according to section 801,
you are inviting problems on your own.

966
00:54:10,416 --> 00:54:12,958
Yes! If required I will borrow them.

967
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,208
Tsunami star Subash!

968
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:17,000
Girl is mine! Guys! Pack up!

969
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,500
Sir, you are dealing
very badly with a youth hero.

970
00:54:25,833 --> 00:54:26,791
Blow it.

971
00:54:34,541 --> 00:54:36,958
- You said youth.
- Breath is not reaching.

972
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:39,458
Why should I enter into fight with you?

973
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:42,416
Call the girl too. I will give you
clarity from here and then I will leave.

974
00:54:42,458 --> 00:54:43,750
Wish you happy birthday, Babu.

975
00:54:43,791 --> 00:54:44,958
But that ill-fated day is tomorrow.

976
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,708
One entire day is spent in 801, Babu.

977
00:54:47,708 --> 00:54:49,583
Did you thrash one whole day?

978
00:54:49,625 --> 00:54:51,000
You need call sheet?

979
00:54:51,041 --> 00:54:53,083
Who is he? Who said he loves my sister?

980
00:54:53,125 --> 00:54:54,833
- Green shirt Greek hero!
- Oh no!

981
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:57,000
This guy! Old rascal!

982
00:54:57,041 --> 00:55:00,041
You look like a broiler hen suffering
from bird flu. Do you want my sister?

983
00:55:00,083 --> 00:55:01,041
Rascal! Stop!

984
00:55:01,666 --> 00:55:02,958
Tsunami star Subash!

985
00:55:03,583 --> 00:55:05,500
Oh my God! Sir, is that you?

986
00:55:05,541 --> 00:55:07,333
I like you very much!

987
00:55:07,375 --> 00:55:10,458
I like your 'Police
Debba' movie very much!

988
00:55:13,375 --> 00:55:15,583
I acted at that time
and now I tasted it.

989
00:55:15,625 --> 00:55:16,750
Look into my eyes.

990
00:55:16,791 --> 00:55:20,250
<i>"Like a spreading poison."</i>

991
00:55:20,291 --> 00:55:21,250
The required person has come.

992
00:55:21,291 --> 00:55:22,791
If we discuss the matter then FIR and--

993
00:55:22,833 --> 00:55:23,375
Shut up!

994
00:55:23,916 --> 00:55:26,291
There is timing and
rhyming for every dialogue.

995
00:55:26,333 --> 00:55:27,750
Before sir writes FIR...

996
00:55:27,791 --> 00:55:29,541
...if we say here is
no affair between us...

997
00:55:29,583 --> 00:55:30,625
...I will go in my Safari.

998
00:55:30,666 --> 00:55:31,958
- Wow!
- Superb rhyming, sir!

999
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,500
Will you sacrifice
our love by fearing police?

1000
00:55:35,291 --> 00:55:37,916
Suba, I love you.
I just love you!

1001
00:55:41,833 --> 00:55:43,583
Stop!

1002
00:55:44,583 --> 00:55:45,666
Get back!

1003
00:55:45,958 --> 00:55:47,916
Wow! Wow! You got thrashed so well, sir!

1004
00:55:47,958 --> 00:55:50,333
- You are a real hero, sir.
- Stupid woman!

1005
00:55:50,375 --> 00:55:52,791
Do you have sense? They are killing me!

1006
00:55:52,833 --> 00:55:55,500
Tell her. What is her age and my age?

1007
00:55:55,541 --> 00:55:57,291
Girl belongs to sir.

1008
00:55:58,208 --> 00:55:59,500
Guys! Pack up!

1009
00:55:59,791 --> 00:56:00,791
- Greetings, sir.
- Move away!

1010
00:56:00,833 --> 00:56:02,416
Hey, Mahi! You--

1011
00:56:02,458 --> 00:56:04,625
Why do you make it late?
Express the feelings inside you.

1012
00:56:05,625 --> 00:56:07,916
Should I do? I hate you!

1013
00:56:09,583 --> 00:56:12,208
I hate your character!
I hate your attitude!

1014
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:13,375
I am a journalist.

1015
00:56:13,416 --> 00:56:16,125
There is no need for the
man who marries me to be great.

1016
00:56:16,166 --> 00:56:18,666
It is sufficient if he is not like you.

1017
00:56:28,708 --> 00:56:32,166
You must be aware that a software
engineer got murdered in the city.

1018
00:56:32,208 --> 00:56:35,166
We identified a number plate from
the place where the murder took place.

1019
00:56:35,541 --> 00:56:38,583
That number plate is registered in
your brother's name with your address.

1020
00:56:39,166 --> 00:56:41,458
So you both come to the station once.

1021
00:56:43,916 --> 00:56:45,750
Yes, Brownie! Why are you barking?

1022
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,458
Don't you know how to
behave in front of elders?

1023
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:49,875
It seems it has become very arrogant.

1024
00:56:50,458 --> 00:56:52,916
If we keep her inside
the cage and thrash...

1025
00:56:53,291 --> 00:56:54,666
...for few days then
it will become fine.

1026
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:08,750
GK sir, you filed a complaint
saying your car is lost.

1027
00:57:08,791 --> 00:57:10,625
It is found in old city, sir.

1028
00:57:12,291 --> 00:57:15,125
I worked hard and found the
car but number plate is missing.

1029
00:57:15,166 --> 00:57:18,000
Hey, number plate is found by DGP sir.

1030
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:19,416
Really?

1031
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:22,416
Where is it? Give the number plate.

1032
00:57:22,458 --> 00:57:24,166
AP9Z 4737.

1033
00:57:24,208 --> 00:57:27,375
Hey, it is the same.
GK sir, your work is done.

1034
00:57:27,416 --> 00:57:28,583
And my payment--

1035
00:57:30,041 --> 00:57:32,375
If you give the statement
then I will leave.

1036
00:57:33,375 --> 00:57:35,416
Will you tell me to come to station?

1037
00:57:36,583 --> 00:57:38,375
When a policeman lowers
his head in front of me...

1038
00:57:38,416 --> 00:57:41,041
...the blood in my body
runs with high voltage.

1039
00:57:42,666 --> 00:57:44,625
I feel very good!

1040
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,875
I hate police.

1041
00:57:48,375 --> 00:57:49,958
Sir, this is just sample.

1042
00:57:50,208 --> 00:57:51,875
You will see a lot in coming days.

1043
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:03,625
Morning, Mr. Kashi.

1044
00:58:03,666 --> 00:58:05,250
Why did sir tell me to come urgently?

1045
00:58:05,291 --> 00:58:06,666
Do you know how big
mistake you are committing?

1046
00:58:06,708 --> 00:58:07,625
Keep quiet, Mr. Kashi.

1047
00:58:07,666 --> 00:58:09,625
Why do you talk irritatingly like him
saying right and wrong?

1048
00:58:10,083 --> 00:58:13,333
He doesn't care for his
wife and children except duty.

1049
00:58:15,541 --> 00:58:18,875
Listen to me and you too
get released from him soon.

1050
00:58:18,916 --> 00:58:20,708
Sir, make some money before you retire.

1051
00:58:40,416 --> 00:58:42,208
Do you know who these people are?

1052
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:45,958
They are not politicians who does
scams or criminals who commit crimes?

1053
00:58:46,458 --> 00:58:48,250
They are the most
respectable police officers...

1054
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:50,500
...who laid down their lives
for the country.

1055
00:58:58,791 --> 00:59:01,083
Policemen who lets off a bike
if you give 500 rupees to them...

1056
00:59:01,125 --> 00:59:03,375
...and policemen who strikes
off the case if you give 1000 rupees.

1057
00:59:03,416 --> 00:59:05,083
They are found one in every street.

1058
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:07,625
But in spite of knowing
they are going to die...

1059
00:59:07,958 --> 00:59:10,833
...they join the police
and sacrifice their lives...

1060
00:59:11,416 --> 00:59:13,000
...are one in thousands.

1061
00:59:13,375 --> 00:59:14,916
It is sufficient...

1062
00:59:14,958 --> 00:59:18,041
...if you live like him for one day,
one minute and one second.

1063
00:59:20,541 --> 00:59:23,166
There is a heart behind
every police badge.

1064
00:59:23,416 --> 00:59:28,041
This heart has mother, father, sister,
wife, children and all relationships.

1065
00:59:28,416 --> 00:59:31,375
By overcoming all of them
and by turning his heart into stone...

1066
00:59:31,708 --> 00:59:35,125
...these policemen have move
ahead by considering their duty as life.

1067
00:59:38,125 --> 00:59:42,333
Every day before leaving for duty,
I am proudly await...

1068
00:59:42,375 --> 00:59:44,041
...when will I join these photos.

1069
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:50,375
What did you say? Don't I care for wife
and children even when they are dying?

1070
00:59:51,208 --> 00:59:53,833
Because of my not coming
to your mother that day...

1071
00:59:53,875 --> 00:59:56,291
...I could save lot of mothers
and children over there.

1072
00:59:57,958 --> 00:59:59,375
You must have faced loss...

1073
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,166
...but many people
over there got justice.

1074
01:00:02,208 --> 01:00:03,416
Mother!

1075
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:15,125
I will act with honesty, courtesy
and regard for the welfare of others...

1076
01:00:15,166 --> 01:00:17,375
...and will endeavour to develop
these sprit of the cops...

1077
01:00:17,416 --> 01:00:19,875
...for every policeman
who took this vow...

1078
01:00:20,458 --> 01:00:23,291
...duty first, family next.

1079
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:27,791
But you are supporting that
GK because of your anger on me.

1080
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:30,208
Do you know this is
the case of a girl's murder?

1081
01:00:31,166 --> 01:00:33,000
Do you know who the girl that died is?

1082
01:01:16,291 --> 01:01:18,541
Do you know who killed her?

1083
01:01:19,625 --> 01:01:21,041
Do you know how they killed?

1084
01:01:22,875 --> 01:01:24,625
Who are you? Leave me!

1085
01:01:25,125 --> 01:01:26,500
Where will you run?

1086
01:01:26,541 --> 01:01:28,083
Stop!

1087
01:01:28,333 --> 01:01:30,583
Hey, who is it? Leave her!

1088
01:01:30,875 --> 01:01:32,000
Hey!

1089
01:01:43,416 --> 01:01:44,666
Kavya!

1090
01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:46,625
What happened, dear?

1091
01:01:50,166 --> 01:01:51,458
Kavya... Get up, Kavya.

1092
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:53,375
Hey!

1093
01:01:56,125 --> 01:01:57,291
You!

1094
01:01:58,375 --> 01:02:00,000
No! Girl is missed!

1095
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:09,291
You have disturbed the entire mood!

1096
01:02:10,291 --> 01:02:12,083
Kill her!

1097
01:02:12,125 --> 01:02:13,833
Kill her!

1098
01:02:51,791 --> 01:02:54,708
After Kavya's father came
out of come and told the truth...

1099
01:02:54,958 --> 01:02:56,916
...we came to know
that it is Kava who died.

1100
01:03:00,041 --> 01:03:03,708
These days we think why should we
care when injustice occurs on roads...

1101
01:03:04,208 --> 01:03:05,875
...but in spite of being handicapped...

1102
01:03:06,375 --> 01:03:09,791
...she died in the hands of those
scoundrels while trying to save a girl.

1103
01:03:12,333 --> 01:03:15,583
GK is trying to save
his brother with his power.

1104
01:03:16,291 --> 01:03:18,791
Shall we leave the rascal?

1105
01:03:20,708 --> 01:03:23,250
It is okay if you don't
accept me as father...

1106
01:03:24,125 --> 01:03:27,375
...but don't know whether you
do justice to the girl as brother...

1107
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:29,958
...you only decide it.

1108
01:03:38,791 --> 01:03:40,083
Good evening everybody.

1109
01:03:40,125 --> 01:03:42,666
Software engineer
didn't die in this case.

1110
01:03:43,083 --> 01:03:44,625
A special girl by name Kavya.

1111
01:03:44,666 --> 01:03:46,875
Children of bigwigs are behind it.

1112
01:03:46,916 --> 01:03:49,000
I will not spare anyone
in spite of any pressure.

1113
01:03:49,291 --> 01:03:50,916
I will arrest everyone.

1114
01:03:51,291 --> 01:03:53,833
Our department took this
case with great challenge.

1115
01:03:54,208 --> 01:03:56,250
We need your media support too.

1116
01:03:56,291 --> 01:04:00,041
We are taking action based on
the complaint given by Kavya's father.

1117
01:04:00,083 --> 01:04:01,750
We will close this case very soon.

1118
01:04:09,791 --> 01:04:12,041
- Sir, they are killing me.
- Srikanth, let's move.

1119
01:04:27,458 --> 01:04:29,750
Sir... sir... sir.

1120
01:04:33,416 --> 01:04:35,833
Sir, they are killing me. Save me, sir.

1121
01:04:39,916 --> 01:04:42,833
Hey! Why did you hide behind him?

1122
01:04:43,083 --> 01:04:45,166
Do you think he is police?

1123
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:49,958
He comes running like a dog
if I show him a hundred rupees note.

1124
01:04:52,375 --> 01:04:54,416
Come and take this 100 and leave him.

1125
01:04:58,291 --> 01:04:59,958
He seems to be feeling inhibition.

1126
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,791
Go and drag the old man.

1127
01:05:35,791 --> 01:05:37,083
'ACP Kalyan on duty!'

1128
01:08:10,833 --> 01:08:12,541
Brother, ACP is killing me.

1129
01:08:13,625 --> 01:08:14,833
Brother.

1130
01:08:15,958 --> 01:08:18,541
- ACP Kalyan!
- Oh! Sir has changed!

1131
01:08:19,125 --> 01:08:21,458
I will trample sincere officers.

1132
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:23,916
You will trample them if
they are sincere from beginning

1133
01:08:23,958 --> 01:08:26,166
But if a eccentric person
like me turns sincere then...

1134
01:08:26,208 --> 01:08:28,541
...he will bury you alive! Bloody fool!

1135
01:08:28,583 --> 01:08:30,958
Hey! You cannot tolerate
the speed with which I come!

1136
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,166
My route is not highway
so that you will come in speed.

1137
01:08:34,208 --> 01:08:37,083
Hard road!
You will die if speed becomes more.

1138
01:08:37,125 --> 01:08:39,333
- Hey, you don't know about me.
- No need!

1139
01:08:39,375 --> 01:08:42,458
My blood boils if you
tell about bio-data’s.

1140
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:46,125
Today is the last happiest
day to you and your brother in life.

1141
01:08:46,166 --> 01:08:50,000
Eat your favourite food, drink your
favourite brand and sleep peacefully.

1142
01:08:50,041 --> 01:08:51,916
From tomorrow,
cases, arrests, protests...

1143
01:08:51,958 --> 01:08:56,416
...roadblocks all throughout the day.
You will go mad!

1144
01:08:56,958 --> 01:08:59,375
It is fun for you to
play with police, right?

1145
01:08:59,625 --> 01:09:02,041
A right policeman has entered your life.

1146
01:09:02,083 --> 01:09:05,000
Come! Let us play!

1147
01:09:33,166 --> 01:09:33,875
Tell me, Reddy.

1148
01:09:33,916 --> 01:09:36,083
Bail is brought to
get GK's men released.

1149
01:09:44,625 --> 01:09:46,125
Hey! For how long should we wait.

1150
01:09:57,125 --> 01:09:58,416
Sir, bail papers.

1151
01:09:58,458 --> 01:09:59,958
This is the way to ask for bail.

1152
01:10:03,666 --> 01:10:04,833
- Reddy.
- Sir.

1153
01:10:05,125 --> 01:10:06,166
Leave them.

1154
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,250
Come. Come.

1155
01:10:16,791 --> 01:10:17,541
What is it, sir?

1156
01:10:17,583 --> 01:10:20,875
They behaved indecently with our
lady constable for rejecting the bail.

1157
01:10:21,583 --> 01:10:22,541
Who? Me?

1158
01:10:27,791 --> 01:10:29,083
What is it, sir?

1159
01:10:29,125 --> 01:10:30,833
Why did you put our guys in jail
when they came to give bail?

1160
01:10:31,083 --> 01:10:32,541
Here is the bail!
Release our guys.

1161
01:10:32,583 --> 01:10:33,500
Okay.

1162
01:10:33,541 --> 01:10:34,916
Mr. Reddy.

1163
01:10:34,958 --> 01:10:35,833
Yes, sir!

1164
01:10:42,625 --> 01:10:44,583
Hey! Sir... what is this, sir?

1165
01:10:44,625 --> 01:10:48,083
You tortured our SI and CI
very brutally for not giving the bail.

1166
01:10:48,125 --> 01:10:49,625
Who? Me?

1167
01:10:54,666 --> 01:10:55,791
ACP!

1168
01:10:55,833 --> 01:10:58,166
If anybody comes inside, you are
keeping us in jail by filing some case.

1169
01:10:58,208 --> 01:11:00,125
We will give the bail outside
and take them from outside.

1170
01:11:00,166 --> 01:11:01,500
Come on, guys!

1171
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:03,791
- Attention!
- Sir!

1172
01:11:04,916 --> 01:11:06,375
Attack1

1173
01:11:14,875 --> 01:11:16,583
Brett Lee!

1174
01:11:16,625 --> 01:11:20,500
- Hey! This is bomb!
- I know!

1175
01:11:21,125 --> 01:11:23,500
- Have you gone mad?
- Not mad!

1176
01:11:24,375 --> 01:11:26,125
I will keep this one
and you keep the bomb.

1177
01:11:32,666 --> 01:11:34,208
Hey, ACP! What is happening?

1178
01:11:34,250 --> 01:11:37,000
Will you attack our
station for not giving bail?

1179
01:11:37,291 --> 01:11:38,833
Who? Me?

1180
01:11:42,333 --> 01:11:44,750
Hello? Sir,
Home Minister is on the call.

1181
01:11:44,791 --> 01:11:47,208
Whether it is Home or CM over the phone,
matter is the same.

1182
01:11:47,458 --> 01:11:50,000
The person who gives food, pays salaries
to the rascals inside the jail...

1183
01:11:50,041 --> 01:11:53,208
...if he is here within 15 minutes ...

1184
01:11:53,250 --> 01:11:55,541
...with his id card,
aadhaar card and pay slips...

1185
01:11:55,583 --> 01:11:57,333
...only then anybody will go out.

1186
01:11:57,375 --> 01:12:00,791
Otherwise if they come with
bail then they will get thrashed.

1187
01:12:00,833 --> 01:12:04,000
Hey, does he think I am
Home Guard or Home Minister?

1188
01:12:06,083 --> 01:12:07,416
GK!

1189
01:12:09,125 --> 01:12:10,166
Reddy!

1190
01:12:10,208 --> 01:12:12,125
Gk has not entered the
station till now, right?

1191
01:12:12,166 --> 01:12:13,625
Yes, sir.

1192
01:12:13,666 --> 01:12:16,416
He will be in this station
in another 15 minutes.

1193
01:12:32,291 --> 01:12:35,125
Raja, our guys will not
come out until we go inside.

1194
01:12:35,166 --> 01:12:36,375
Please, Raja.

1195
01:12:44,458 --> 01:12:46,375
Greetings, Mr. Home Minister.

1196
01:12:46,416 --> 01:12:47,750
Greetings.

1197
01:12:49,708 --> 01:12:53,250
Id card, aadhaar card, pay slips...
entire proofs are there.

1198
01:12:54,083 --> 01:12:56,750
They are my men. Leave them.

1199
01:12:56,791 --> 01:12:58,541
You came to the station
for the first time.

1200
01:12:58,583 --> 01:13:01,541
What will you take? Coffee? Tea?

1201
01:13:01,583 --> 01:13:03,500
Don't want coffee, tea.
It is hot outside.

1202
01:13:03,541 --> 01:13:06,166
We came in sun.
Arrange for coconut water. Yes, GK?

1203
01:13:06,875 --> 01:13:09,291
Why do we need your respect?
First release our guys.

1204
01:13:09,333 --> 01:13:11,250
- Release them, Reddy.
- Sir, we will not come.

1205
01:13:11,291 --> 01:13:12,791
- We will not come, sir.
- We will come out.

1206
01:13:12,833 --> 01:13:15,125
Sir will gesture and they salute.

1207
01:13:15,166 --> 01:13:16,333
We will receive double thrashing
after entering inside again.

1208
01:13:16,375 --> 01:13:16,791
No, sir.

1209
01:13:16,833 --> 01:13:18,458
- We will not come, sir!
- Come out, guys!

1210
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:20,750
He will start a poem
if he changes his mind.

1211
01:13:22,041 --> 01:13:23,333
Come, GK. Let us go.

1212
01:13:23,375 --> 01:13:25,250
I will get him transferred
from here in 30 minutes.

1213
01:13:33,541 --> 01:13:35,250
What is the problem
with both father and son?

1214
01:13:36,375 --> 01:13:39,458
My brother had killed that
dumb girl with his friends.

1215
01:13:39,875 --> 01:13:41,666
If you were to prove it...

1216
01:13:41,708 --> 01:13:46,458
...courts, witness, judgments,
postponing... it is a big process.

1217
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:48,375
I will take my brother in this gap...

1218
01:13:49,916 --> 01:13:51,541
...and make him sit in parliament.

1219
01:13:52,666 --> 01:13:54,833
Do you know what a politician is?

1220
01:13:55,958 --> 01:13:58,333
Do you know what a politician is?

1221
01:14:00,250 --> 01:14:02,083
Politician means king.

1222
01:14:02,708 --> 01:14:06,625
He makes hundreds of
policemen like you salute him.

1223
01:14:08,541 --> 01:14:11,791
Politician means leader.
What we say is final.

1224
01:14:12,916 --> 01:14:14,541
Public is behind us.

1225
01:14:14,583 --> 01:14:16,416
Politician is magician.

1226
01:14:16,958 --> 01:14:18,250
Magic.

1227
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,583
He will perform magic.

1228
01:14:21,166 --> 01:14:25,416
Chevipoku, he shouldn't go anywhere.
He should be here only.

1229
01:14:25,458 --> 01:14:27,166
I should play with him.

1230
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:28,916
Hey, ACP.

1231
01:14:28,958 --> 01:14:31,125
I am giving you one week's time.

1232
01:14:31,416 --> 01:14:34,708
If you have guts then bring
my brother and put him in jail.

1233
01:14:35,666 --> 01:14:38,791
One week. Try it.

1234
01:14:43,375 --> 01:14:45,125
One week is too long.

1235
01:14:45,875 --> 01:14:47,916
Three days are enough.

1236
01:14:54,583 --> 01:14:56,041
GK.

1237
01:14:56,666 --> 01:14:58,250
You said you want to see a policeman...

1238
01:14:58,291 --> 01:15:00,083
...who stands in front of you
and twirls his moustache.

1239
01:15:00,750 --> 01:15:02,500
My son has come.

1240
01:15:08,458 --> 01:15:10,666
- Well done.
- Thank you, sir.

1241
01:15:23,333 --> 01:15:25,458
Sister, this is uncle's office.

1242
01:15:26,416 --> 01:15:28,416
How come there is so much change in you?

1243
01:15:28,458 --> 01:15:31,375
- There is a change in him.
- Oh! Come.

1244
01:15:32,458 --> 01:15:35,875
The only evidence we have
in this case is that software girl.

1245
01:15:35,916 --> 01:15:38,875
Sir, she left Hyderabad out
of fear after the issue happened.

1246
01:15:38,916 --> 01:15:40,708
Try from all possible angles.

1247
01:15:40,750 --> 01:15:42,625
At any cost, we have to trace her.

1248
01:15:42,666 --> 01:15:45,416
It is a great thing for me
to come here because of my height.

1249
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:46,583
So promotion is difficult now.

1250
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:47,916
Where is DGP sir's room?

1251
01:15:47,958 --> 01:15:49,958
- He is in meeting?
- So ACP sir?

1252
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,125
He too is in meeting,
It is not possible to meet.

1253
01:15:52,666 --> 01:15:53,583
Anyway, it is okay, brother-in-law...

1254
01:15:53,625 --> 01:15:55,750
- Sister, waiting is not possible by me.
- Give the phone.

1255
01:15:56,666 --> 01:15:59,583
Hello, I came to uncle DGP's office.

1256
01:15:59,625 --> 01:16:02,250
We thought of talking
about promotions, right?

1257
01:16:02,291 --> 01:16:03,291
- Madam! Madam!
- From those two--

1258
01:16:03,333 --> 01:16:04,666
I will show you SGP's room, madam.

1259
01:16:04,708 --> 01:16:05,750
Come.

1260
01:16:05,791 --> 01:16:07,291
- You are very sharp.
- Thanks, madam.

1261
01:16:07,333 --> 01:16:09,208
- Why is the fan turned on inside?
- SI sir!

1262
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:10,208
What is the nuisance inside the cell?

1263
01:16:10,250 --> 01:16:12,000
Fan is turned on inside.
Go to hell inside!

1264
01:16:12,041 --> 01:16:13,500
- Did you understand?
- Come, madam.

1265
01:16:13,541 --> 01:16:14,958
Come. There is a good command in you.

1266
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,208
Really thanks, madam.

1267
01:16:16,625 --> 01:16:18,291
- Come.
- Greetings.

1268
01:16:18,333 --> 01:16:19,333
Sir.

1269
01:16:21,041 --> 01:16:22,291
Who are you?

1270
01:16:23,166 --> 01:16:25,250
- You said uncle.
- You said busy.

1271
01:16:25,291 --> 01:16:27,500
To talk to ACP about
my sister's marriage--

1272
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,208
Oh! My sister is the name of the serial.
Her husband is its producer.

1273
01:16:31,250 --> 01:16:33,250
They complain to sir because of the fight
between director and producer.

1274
01:16:33,291 --> 01:16:34,916
No! No!
Not serial, it is real.

1275
01:16:34,958 --> 01:16:36,250
- This is tagline. It is very nice.
- Sir!

1276
01:16:36,291 --> 01:16:37,125
Let us go!

1277
01:16:37,625 --> 01:16:39,166
What is it? Father and
son met with great difficulty.

1278
01:16:39,208 --> 01:16:41,583
What will he think if you
talk of sister and marriage?

1279
01:16:41,625 --> 01:16:44,333
Take some gap,
find his mood and tell him this matter.

1280
01:16:44,958 --> 01:16:46,416
I am sorry if I disturbed you.

1281
01:16:46,916 --> 01:16:50,625
Now you look like the person
whom I want to marry should look like.

1282
01:16:51,416 --> 01:16:54,875
You are fighting for
justice in Kavya's case.,.

1283
01:16:55,458 --> 01:16:57,541
...and I feel proud as a girl for it.

1284
01:16:58,416 --> 01:17:01,458
I am ready to do any
help for you in this case.

1285
01:17:02,208 --> 01:17:05,125
Not as reporter but
as your life partner.

1286
01:17:21,458 --> 01:17:23,458
<i>"Girl is superb!"</i>

1287
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:25,416

I will get her."</i>

He suits me in every aspect."</i>

- Hello.
- Hello, ACP. Good evening.

1322
01:20:28,541 --> 01:20:30,958
It seems father and son is
working very hard day and night.

1323
01:20:31,250 --> 01:20:34,083
There is breaking news
to put brakes to your speed.

1324
01:20:34,666 --> 01:20:36,208
Turn on the TV if it is nearby.

1325
01:20:37,791 --> 01:20:39,500
A new twist in Kavya's case.

1326
01:20:39,541 --> 01:20:42,083
The three youngsters who surrendered
say they committed the killing.

1327
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:48,583
How is the shock?

1328
01:20:50,125 --> 01:20:51,458
Sir! Sir!

1329
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:54,541
Sir, these are the items
we found at the murder spot.

1330
01:20:57,583 --> 01:20:59,791
You tried to put my brother in jail...

1331
01:20:59,833 --> 01:21:01,708
...and now the time has come
for you to salute him.

1332
01:21:02,750 --> 01:21:06,375
Brother ACP.
Turn on the TV if it is near.

1333
01:21:07,625 --> 01:21:12,083
As expected by everyone, MP GK's
brother Nani is made youth president.

1334
01:21:12,125 --> 01:21:12,708
Hail Nani!

1335
01:21:12,750 --> 01:21:15,750
Nani has been elected as youth
president for Navodaya college...

1336
01:21:15,791 --> 01:21:18,875
...GK's followers and
party leaders felt happy.

1337
01:21:18,916 --> 01:21:20,416
On the way to Parliament.

1338
01:21:22,208 --> 01:21:25,041
Gate two. Shock number two.

1339
01:21:28,625 --> 01:21:31,291
Srikanth,
inform all the district headquarters.

1340
01:21:31,333 --> 01:21:33,458
We have to trace the girl at any cost.
Come on! Quick!

1341
01:21:40,333 --> 01:21:43,583
Srinu, he said he will
arrest in three days...

1342
01:21:43,625 --> 01:21:45,375
...and is drinking
sweet buttermilk coolly.

1343
01:21:52,166 --> 01:21:54,833
Sir, girls location
is traced in Tirupati.

1344
01:21:54,875 --> 01:21:56,500
- Good! Kashi.
- Sir.

1345
01:21:56,541 --> 01:21:59,125
With him security, shift
that girl immediately to Hyderabad.

1346
01:22:09,458 --> 01:22:11,875
Govinda! Govinda!

1347
01:22:13,083 --> 01:22:16,250
DGP sir, we heard that
girl is found in Tirupati.

1348
01:22:17,083 --> 01:22:21,583
Before your staff reached there, our
men brought her home in Indigo flight.

1349
01:22:25,458 --> 01:22:27,958
The girl who is the
witness in this girl...

1350
01:22:28,541 --> 01:22:31,416
...I am going to get her married
to my brother in half an hour.

1351
01:22:32,416 --> 01:22:34,125
She will never testify
in her life at all.

1352
01:22:36,708 --> 01:22:40,708
Brother ACP, talk something.
I want to hear your voice.

1353
01:22:43,541 --> 01:22:46,416
Brother GK... Indigo flight.

1354
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:50,208
You made ten scoundrels
sit in flight for the first time.

1355
01:22:50,625 --> 01:22:52,458
Waste of one lakhs rupees!

1356
01:22:52,750 --> 01:22:56,041
That girl was not at the spot
when the murder took place that day.

1357
01:22:56,583 --> 01:22:58,875
She is the primary
witness to this case but...

1358
01:22:59,125 --> 01:23:00,375
...not main witness.

1359
01:23:01,875 --> 01:23:04,708
The main witness and
death sentence to this case...

1360
01:23:04,958 --> 01:23:07,083
...I have caught the direct witness.

1361
01:23:08,791 --> 01:23:10,833
Hey! What are you talking?

1362
01:23:10,875 --> 01:23:14,500
If there is TV nearby, turn it on once.

1363
01:23:14,750 --> 01:23:17,125
- Hey! TV! Turn on the TV!
- Okay, brother.

1364
01:23:17,166 --> 01:23:21,041
Whether it is the district
where I am born or you are born...

1365
01:23:21,083 --> 01:23:24,666
...let it be any district,
I will create ruckus!

1366
01:23:24,708 --> 01:23:26,500
Seetaiah! He will not listen to anybody!

1367
01:23:27,625 --> 01:23:29,375
- Turn on the news channel!
- Oh!

1368
01:23:29,833 --> 01:23:31,750
New twist in Kavya's case.

1369
01:23:31,791 --> 01:23:34,291
The four people who confessed
to the crime are proved to be fake.

1370
01:23:34,333 --> 01:23:36,875
Police has caught the
key witness in this case.

1371
01:23:36,916 --> 01:23:39,125
You watch who the witness is.

1372
01:23:45,416 --> 01:23:47,625
Items found at the place of murder.

1373
01:23:55,208 --> 01:23:58,916
Sir, I have seen GK's
brother killing Kavya brutally.

1374
01:24:10,125 --> 01:24:11,958
I couldn't do anything that day in fear.

1375
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,083
But ACP sir came and encouraged me so...

1376
01:24:14,125 --> 01:24:15,666
...I came out
and I am telling the truth.

1377
01:24:15,916 --> 01:24:17,625
Sir, hang them in
the middle of the road.

1378
01:24:18,791 --> 01:24:20,791
Brother, what is there
to feel shock in it?

1379
01:24:20,833 --> 01:24:22,583
Since she was the witness so we
thought of getting her married to him.

1380
01:24:22,625 --> 01:24:24,375
Now she is the witness
so let her get married to him.

1381
01:24:24,750 --> 01:24:27,750
True! Look how good the couple
looks like a bollywood hero and heroine.

1382
01:24:27,791 --> 01:24:28,375
Yes!

1383
01:24:28,416 --> 01:24:29,958
- Rascal!
- No!

1384
01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:35,083
You said your brother
is on the way to Parliament.

1385
01:24:35,125 --> 01:24:36,791
Take diversion!

1386
01:24:36,833 --> 01:24:39,458
On the way to central jail.

1387
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:42,375
Out of three days I said,
one hour is left.

1388
01:24:42,666 --> 01:24:46,875
In the next 60 minutes, entire
city will be filled with siren sound!

1389
01:24:46,916 --> 01:24:48,125
Red alert!

1390
01:24:51,875 --> 01:24:54,375
Sir! Sir! Sir!

1391
01:24:59,666 --> 01:25:00,916
I have locked, sir.

1392
01:25:02,708 --> 01:25:05,916
Wasim! Tiger of old city!

1393
01:25:06,916 --> 01:25:10,250
What? You are acting very
smart in the city these days.

1394
01:25:10,750 --> 01:25:13,916
Do you have guts to
arrest my friend's son?

1395
01:25:13,958 --> 01:25:18,541
If you have then come to old
city in ten minutes and show your guts.

1396
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:21,625
Come! Come and show your manhood!

1397
01:25:34,083 --> 01:25:36,666
Give it to me fast, it's my turn.

1398
01:26:28,875 --> 01:26:31,041
Come on! Search! Search!
Search!  Search the entire house.

1399
01:26:31,541 --> 01:26:32,375
Hey, ACP!

1400
01:26:32,416 --> 01:26:34,375
- Let him be anywhere, drag him out.
- You--

1401
01:26:35,333 --> 01:26:36,625
Talk to me!

1402
01:26:36,666 --> 01:26:38,291
Come on! Come on! Do it fast!

1403
01:26:39,250 --> 01:26:40,583
Sir, he is caught.

1404
01:26:42,541 --> 01:26:44,875
Leave! Leave!

1405
01:26:49,083 --> 01:26:50,833
Bhai! My son?

1406
01:26:59,708 --> 01:27:01,416
This is my area.

1407
01:27:01,458 --> 01:27:03,666
You cannot go by facing my men.

1408
01:27:04,333 --> 01:27:05,916
Thrash the rascal!

1409
01:27:16,875 --> 01:27:19,541
Arabic! (Chanting from Quran)

1410
01:27:19,583 --> 01:27:21,750
Arabic! (Chanting from Quran)

1411
01:27:21,791 --> 01:27:23,791
Arabic! (Chanting from Quran)

1412
01:27:26,291 --> 01:27:28,166
Arabic! (Chanting from Quran)

1413
01:27:28,208 --> 01:27:30,166
Arabic! (Chanting from Quran)

1414
01:27:30,208 --> 01:27:32,000
Arabic! (Chanting from Quran)

1415
01:27:37,750 --> 01:27:41,208
Wasim Bhai! Quran! Holy book!

1416
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,833
I think you know
the meaning of sentence.

1417
01:27:44,958 --> 01:27:47,958
It is a big mistake to save
the person who commits mistake.

1418
01:27:48,291 --> 01:27:50,708
If you do it then even
God will not forgive you.

1419
01:27:50,750 --> 01:27:52,125
Wonderful, son!

1420
01:28:09,166 --> 01:28:09,625
JP sir--

1421
01:28:09,666 --> 01:28:11,125
Brother-in-law, Bhanumathi
is telling to put money in account.

1422
01:28:11,166 --> 01:28:11,833
- You!
- No!

1423
01:28:11,875 --> 01:28:14,291
GK! GK!
Control! Control! You stop it, rascal!

1424
01:28:14,583 --> 01:28:16,500
Why do you take tension?

1425
01:28:16,541 --> 01:28:18,250
I am the central minister.

1426
01:28:18,291 --> 01:28:20,250
We have played with...

1427
01:28:20,291 --> 01:28:22,041
...so many policemen.

1428
01:28:22,083 --> 01:28:23,750
Let that ACP come. We will see.

1429
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:08,708
What is it with him?

1430
01:29:08,750 --> 01:29:11,291
Wherever we go,
he fires bullets on us rapidly.

1431
01:29:11,333 --> 01:29:13,041
Does he have a bullet factory?

1432
01:29:56,333 --> 01:29:57,791
What is all this?

1433
01:29:57,833 --> 01:30:00,416
GK, policeman has come
to your house for the first time.

1434
01:30:00,916 --> 01:30:02,625
If there is at least
this much chaos then...

1435
01:30:03,291 --> 01:30:05,416
...it will be remembered all your life.

1436
01:30:05,958 --> 01:30:08,000
Do you know it is a big crime...

1437
01:30:08,041 --> 01:30:09,833
- ...to fire bullets in an MP's house?
- Brother...

1438
01:30:10,166 --> 01:30:12,291
...do you want logic in
spite of all these happenings?

1439
01:30:15,541 --> 01:30:16,791
Mr. Reddy.

1440
01:30:17,041 --> 01:30:19,000
Our sir came to arrest here...

1441
01:30:19,041 --> 01:30:22,083
...and because of
GK's men attacking him...

1442
01:30:22,125 --> 01:30:24,750
...ACP sir behaved very intelligently...

1443
01:30:24,791 --> 01:30:27,291
...and have fired one bullet
on leg and two bullets in air.

1444
01:30:27,333 --> 01:30:28,750
- Oh?
- Yes.

1445
01:30:31,375 --> 01:30:33,666
Why does he get fired by asking for it?

1446
01:30:33,708 --> 01:30:35,541
Non-bailable warrant.

1447
01:30:43,083 --> 01:30:45,208
Top most doctors in the city.

1448
01:30:45,250 --> 01:30:46,208
Tell me, doctors.

1449
01:30:46,250 --> 01:30:48,375
Unable to tolerate the allegations
leveled against him...

1450
01:30:48,416 --> 01:30:49,750
...he suffered high BP.

1451
01:30:49,791 --> 01:30:53,625
Because of that,
brain suffered intra-cerebral...

1452
01:30:53,666 --> 01:30:55,583
...and entire body became paralyzed.

1453
01:30:58,166 --> 01:31:01,333
Court has given permission to...

1454
01:31:01,375 --> 01:31:03,125
...shift him to America
urgently for treatment.

1455
01:31:03,166 --> 01:31:04,500
This is law!

1456
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,750
Evening five o'clock flight.

1457
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,125
- Emirates.
- Mr. Reddy.

1458
01:31:17,958 --> 01:31:20,041
Hey! Why are you pouring petrol?

1459
01:31:20,541 --> 01:31:24,208
Don't worry, GK.
Nature cure. Where science fails...

1460
01:31:24,250 --> 01:31:27,000
...ayurveda works.
What do you say, doctors?

1461
01:31:27,041 --> 01:31:28,041
Yes, I saw.

1462
01:31:28,083 --> 01:31:30,083
- Do you have matchbox.
- We are doctors.

1463
01:31:30,333 --> 01:31:32,125
- We have lighter.
- Oh!

1464
01:31:35,208 --> 01:31:36,500
Hey... brother...

1465
01:31:36,541 --> 01:31:38,583
Sir, nature cure is working.

1466
01:31:38,625 --> 01:31:40,333
There is movement in sir's hands.

1467
01:31:40,375 --> 01:31:43,333
Now watch, Mr.
Reddy. Entire body will run 10k.

1468
01:31:45,875 --> 01:31:47,541
- Hey!
- Brother--

1469
01:31:49,291 --> 01:31:50,625
Hey, ACP!

1470
01:31:52,958 --> 01:31:54,916
Yes! That's it!

1471
01:31:57,666 --> 01:31:59,541
He showed us a short film over there.

1472
01:31:59,583 --> 01:32:01,833
He is showing him
an entire film festival!

1473
01:32:01,875 --> 01:32:02,666
Very good! yes!

1474
01:32:02,708 --> 01:32:04,291
- Mr. Reddy.
- He found us.

1475
01:32:04,333 --> 01:32:06,916
Yes. Did you find us? I am coming.

1476
01:32:08,291 --> 01:32:10,208
- When did you come to the city?
- In the morning.

1477
01:32:10,250 --> 01:32:11,333
In the adjacent street...

1478
01:32:11,375 --> 01:32:12,875
...Finance Minister's
elder daughter attained puberty...

1479
01:32:12,916 --> 01:32:14,291
...so I came to meet him.

1480
01:32:14,333 --> 01:32:16,958
- What is your work here?
- It is on the way so to say hi.

1481
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,500
- What will you do now?
- What will I do? I will say bye and go.

1482
01:32:20,583 --> 01:32:23,625
- Brother... brother.
- Brother.

1483
01:32:24,166 --> 01:32:25,750
What did you say?

1484
01:32:25,791 --> 01:32:28,416
Politician is king and trash.

1485
01:32:28,666 --> 01:32:31,041
Should I tell you what a police is?

1486
01:32:34,125 --> 01:32:35,958
Police means power!

1487
01:32:37,166 --> 01:32:39,583
Its impact will be like that.

1488
01:32:41,625 --> 01:32:44,208
Police is fear!

1489
01:32:44,583 --> 01:32:46,500
It is like this.

1490
01:32:48,541 --> 01:32:53,208
Police is arrogance! It is like me.

1491
01:32:54,916 --> 01:32:58,625
This street dog killed
a girl brutally...

1492
01:32:58,875 --> 01:33:01,500
...and I will not spare him
until I get him death sentence.

1493
01:33:02,333 --> 01:33:05,708
I am taking your brother
to station on time as I said.

1494
01:33:05,750 --> 01:33:07,708
I give you too three days time.

1495
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:11,625
Whether you use money,
men, or hold legs or collars...

1496
01:33:11,666 --> 01:33:15,375
...or seek recommendations
or influence... rascal!

1497
01:33:15,791 --> 01:33:17,500
Do whatever you can!

1498
01:33:19,416 --> 01:33:22,583
If you have guts then get
your brother released from station.

1499
01:33:27,541 --> 01:33:28,833
Come!

1500
01:33:28,875 --> 01:33:33,500
GK, generally every person
has one teaspoonful of temper.

1501
01:33:35,041 --> 01:33:38,083
And the guy who wears this
dress will have it in tons.

1502
01:33:51,125 --> 01:33:53,416
What, sir? Why did you arrange
such a big party suddenly?

1503
01:33:53,458 --> 01:33:56,500
My son has shown the
power of police to GK.

1504
01:33:56,541 --> 01:33:58,208
How come we don't celebrate it?

1505
01:33:58,250 --> 01:33:59,666
This is for my son.

1506
01:33:59,708 --> 01:34:01,208
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

1507
01:34:03,958 --> 01:34:06,000
Kantham, I told you that real
police don't attend...

1508
01:34:06,041 --> 01:34:08,041
...parties in uniform.
Did you listen to me?

1509
01:34:08,083 --> 01:34:10,291
It is okay. They will think
that you came directly from station.

1510
01:34:10,333 --> 01:34:11,916
Yes, sir? It seems you
are coming directly from station.

1511
01:34:11,958 --> 01:34:13,750
Didn't I tell you? Come.

1512
01:34:14,875 --> 01:34:16,125
Girl.

1513
01:34:19,791 --> 01:34:20,750
Why is she coming like that?

1514
01:34:20,791 --> 01:34:22,708
Yes? I wore sari with great difficulty.

1515
01:34:22,750 --> 01:34:24,625
Why don't you make a comment or like?

1516
01:34:24,666 --> 01:34:26,625
Mr. Reddy, her sari is nice, isn't it?

1517
01:34:26,666 --> 01:34:28,208
Hey, why do you tell him?

1518
01:34:28,541 --> 01:34:29,833
You said to give a comment or like.

1519
01:34:29,875 --> 01:34:31,708
- Therefore I directly shared it.
- Oh!

1520
01:34:31,750 --> 01:34:34,500
Okay. Now I will go and share
our matter with your dad directly.

1521
01:34:35,125 --> 01:34:37,166
- Hey... hey, Mahi!
- Excuse me, sir.

1522
01:34:38,208 --> 01:34:39,916
- You--
- TV reporter.

1523
01:34:39,958 --> 01:34:40,791
Oh!

1524
01:34:41,166 --> 01:34:42,958
I am travelling
with your son in Kavya's case.

1525
01:34:43,208 --> 01:34:45,708
Good. My son should
always have your support.

1526
01:34:45,958 --> 01:34:47,750
These are common between
wife and husband.

1527
01:34:48,750 --> 01:34:49,708
What?

1528
01:34:49,750 --> 01:34:52,916
Her feeling is that press and
reporter are like wife and husband.

1529
01:34:52,958 --> 01:34:55,250
- You come.
- Say one dialogue.

1530
01:34:55,291 --> 01:34:57,375
Do you think I am a coward
to fear if you scare me?

1531
01:34:57,416 --> 01:34:58,375
Police!

1532
01:34:59,166 --> 01:35:01,500
Excuse me... you--

1533
01:35:01,541 --> 01:35:02,333
My husband.

1534
01:35:02,375 --> 01:35:04,583
You said her husband
is producer of serial.

1535
01:35:04,625 --> 01:35:06,375
Sir, that is side business.
This is profession.

1536
01:35:06,416 --> 01:35:07,708
He is not a police at all.

1537
01:35:08,541 --> 01:35:09,583
My husband is police.

1538
01:35:09,625 --> 01:35:11,958
If he is police then why
did you file complain with us.

1539
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,666
It is... sir, his zone is different.

1540
01:35:13,708 --> 01:35:15,208
- Which zone?
- East coast.

1541
01:35:15,541 --> 01:35:17,500
Why is he telling the train's
name when I am asking the name of zone?

1542
01:35:18,125 --> 01:35:20,000
Sir, he got confused. Eat zone.

1543
01:35:20,041 --> 01:35:21,708
What is your designation?

1544
01:35:21,750 --> 01:35:22,833
Why do you ask me?

1545
01:35:22,875 --> 01:35:24,583
You must have fixed to something.
You tell him.

1546
01:35:24,958 --> 01:35:26,208
DCP.

1547
01:35:26,250 --> 01:35:27,291
East zone DCP.

1548
01:35:27,333 --> 01:35:29,083
I am DCP of east zone.

1549
01:35:29,125 --> 01:35:30,958
Hello, mister.
Where did they transfer me to?

1550
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:32,375
Who knows? Who knows?

1551
01:35:32,416 --> 01:35:33,791
Sambar is over there! Go!

1552
01:35:33,833 --> 01:35:35,416
Ask in inquiry.

1553
01:35:39,541 --> 01:35:40,750
Be careful, father.

1554
01:35:42,333 --> 01:35:43,625
Thanks a lot.

1555
01:35:43,875 --> 01:35:45,541
When your needed the father...

1556
01:35:45,916 --> 01:35:47,458
...I was not by your side.

1557
01:35:47,916 --> 01:35:49,875
But when I needed the son...

1558
01:35:51,458 --> 01:35:53,166
...you are next to me.

1559
01:35:54,541 --> 01:35:56,291
I am sorry.

1560
01:35:57,083 --> 01:35:58,583
No, father.

1561
01:35:58,625 --> 01:36:00,875
I have understood your value...

1562
01:36:01,541 --> 01:36:03,083
...and the value of this uniform.

1563
01:36:12,083 --> 01:36:14,125
Brother-in-law, mason Raju is online.

1564
01:36:14,166 --> 01:36:16,083
He says to cover
these holes with cement.

1565
01:36:16,125 --> 01:36:18,541
What I said was,
we will stick a colour paper...

1566
01:36:18,583 --> 01:36:21,083
...and so the light coming
from out will be colourful.

1567
01:36:21,125 --> 01:36:22,125
What do you say?

1568
01:36:24,291 --> 01:36:26,041
Public is laughing at us.

1569
01:36:26,083 --> 01:36:28,041
Do you hear? Can you hear the laughing?

1570
01:36:28,083 --> 01:36:30,666
Brother-in-law,
ladies are laughing a lot.

1571
01:36:30,916 --> 01:36:33,583
I am thinking how to
get my brother released.

1572
01:36:33,625 --> 01:36:36,333
Should it be covered with cement?
Should we stick a paper?

1573
01:36:37,416 --> 01:36:39,208
- Are all these necessary?
- What shall we do now?

1574
01:36:39,250 --> 01:36:41,083
Youth will not remain silent...

1575
01:36:41,458 --> 01:36:43,250
...when youth leader is inside.

1576
01:36:43,291 --> 01:36:46,375
Provoke all the students'
unions that are under our control.

1577
01:36:46,416 --> 01:36:47,708
City should be held to ransom.

1578
01:37:00,875 --> 01:37:02,958
Release our leader!

1579
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,291
Break them!

1580
01:37:22,875 --> 01:37:24,041
Mr. Reddy.

1581
01:37:25,750 --> 01:37:29,041
My dear students!
Please vacate this place and go.

1582
01:37:29,291 --> 01:37:30,958
All of you have a good future.

1583
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,958
Don't ruin your lives
by following GK's words.

1584
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,500
What will you teach us about our future?

1585
01:37:36,541 --> 01:37:38,583
If GK's brother is not
released within half an hour...

1586
01:37:38,625 --> 01:37:40,250
...city will be set on fire.

1587
01:37:40,291 --> 01:37:43,166
We will commit suicide and die
if you don't release our GK's brother.

1588
01:37:43,208 --> 01:37:45,000
I will climb the cell tower
and die by jumping from there.

1589
01:37:45,041 --> 01:37:46,125
- Police!
- Go Back!

1590
01:37:46,166 --> 01:37:47,250
- Police!
- Go Back!

1591
01:37:47,291 --> 01:37:48,500
- Police!
- Go Back!

1592
01:37:48,541 --> 01:37:49,500
- Police!
- Go Back!

1593
01:37:49,541 --> 01:37:51,166
- Police!
- Reddy! Move.

1594
01:38:02,583 --> 01:38:03,875
Why did you arrest us, sir?

1595
01:38:03,916 --> 01:38:06,041
Did you think how
humiliating it is for us?

1596
01:38:06,083 --> 01:38:07,541
What mistake did we commit, sir?

1597
01:38:07,583 --> 01:38:09,791
If citizens commit mistake
then it is the mistake of police.

1598
01:38:10,083 --> 01:38:12,333
If students commit mistake
then it is the mistake of teachers.

1599
01:38:12,750 --> 01:38:15,500
If children commit mistake
then it is the mistake of parents.

1600
01:38:15,791 --> 01:38:17,291
- Our children--
- Wait!

1601
01:38:17,333 --> 01:38:18,791
Our children are going
to school and studying well.

1602
01:38:18,833 --> 01:38:20,166
What mistake did they commit?

1603
01:38:20,208 --> 01:38:22,541
- Are they going to school and studying?
- Watch it live!

1604
01:38:22,583 --> 01:38:24,125
GK is like my father.

1605
01:38:24,166 --> 01:38:25,875
So who am I?

1606
01:38:25,916 --> 01:38:29,125
There will be no college, exams and
studies until GK's brother is released.

1607
01:38:31,333 --> 01:38:32,791
I swear on my mother and say...

1608
01:38:32,833 --> 01:38:36,333
...we will not move from here until
we see happiness in the eyes of GK sir.

1609
01:39:02,541 --> 01:39:05,750
What? Have all cops
planned picnic on flyover?

1610
01:39:05,791 --> 01:39:07,416
They brought extra
CRPF by fearing us.

1611
01:39:07,458 --> 01:39:08,250
Yep!

1612
01:39:09,166 --> 01:39:11,583
CRPF has not come!

1613
01:39:11,625 --> 01:39:13,291
MRPF!

1614
01:39:14,208 --> 01:39:17,500
Mothers Rapid Protection Force!

1615
01:39:20,250 --> 01:39:21,708
Mother?

1616
01:39:24,125 --> 01:39:26,666
- Mother?
- My dear mothers!

1617
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:28,333
Take positions.

1618
01:39:29,916 --> 01:39:31,166
Attack!

1619
01:39:38,166 --> 01:39:39,250
Mother!

1620
01:39:45,250 --> 01:39:47,250
Come, Reddy. Let us play caroms.

1621
01:39:47,541 --> 01:39:49,583
Sir, only after blood is seen there,
red should be won here.

1622
01:39:49,625 --> 01:39:52,166
Beat! Beat! Beat! Beat!

1623
01:39:52,208 --> 01:39:54,666
Beat! Beat! Beat! Beat!

1624
01:39:54,708 --> 01:39:57,208
Beat! Beat! Beat! Beat!

1625
01:39:57,250 --> 01:39:59,833
Beat! Beat! Beat! Beat!

1626
01:39:59,875 --> 01:40:01,083
Beat! Beat!

1627
01:40:01,333 --> 01:40:04,041
- Hey!
- No! No!

1628
01:40:07,916 --> 01:40:10,125
Beat! Beat! Beat!

1629
01:40:10,166 --> 01:40:12,333
Beat! Beat! Beat!

1630
01:40:12,375 --> 01:40:13,583
Beat! Beat!

1631
01:40:14,208 --> 01:40:16,208
- At what time is the exam?
- 3 o'clock.

1632
01:40:16,250 --> 01:40:18,916
Okay, tell me.
What is the use of capacitor?

1633
01:40:19,916 --> 01:40:22,000
Tell me. How does a processor works?

1634
01:40:23,291 --> 01:40:24,875
What is impulsion?

1635
01:40:24,916 --> 01:40:27,875
How will you write exam
when you don't know anything?

1636
01:40:27,916 --> 01:40:30,541
No college? No exams? No classes?

1637
01:40:30,583 --> 01:40:31,750
What will you do?

1638
01:40:35,125 --> 01:40:38,958
Singham! Singham! Singham!

1639
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:40,791
Singham! Singham! Singham!

1640
01:40:44,041 --> 01:40:47,916
Singham! Singham!
Singham! Singham! Singham!

1641
01:40:47,958 --> 01:40:50,041
Singham! Singham! Singham!

1642
01:40:55,333 --> 01:40:58,916
Singham! Singham! Singham!

1643
01:40:59,208 --> 01:41:01,125
Singham! Singham! Singham!

1644
01:41:03,458 --> 01:41:04,708
Mother, why are you watching like that?

1645
01:41:04,750 --> 01:41:06,958
What is that face as if there
is a power cut while watching serial?

1646
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:08,375
Mother, my heart is skipping its beat
when you are watching silently?

1647
01:41:08,416 --> 01:41:09,750
Say something.

1648
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,291
If possible then forgive
or else punish me.

1649
01:41:12,333 --> 01:41:15,458
Please accept me as your son.
Please accept me.

1650
01:41:15,500 --> 01:41:16,916
I will accept!

1651
01:41:16,958 --> 01:41:21,958
Ah! No! No! No!

1652
01:41:22,291 --> 01:41:23,958
No! No! No! No!

1653
01:41:24,208 --> 01:41:26,500
All mothers are
thrashing their children.

1654
01:41:29,291 --> 01:41:31,166
Where will you escape?

1655
01:41:31,208 --> 01:41:33,708
Will you undertake
strike by skipping college?

1656
01:41:33,750 --> 01:41:35,708
Mother...
mother...  You are finished today.

1657
01:41:36,416 --> 01:41:38,916
- Mother!
- "She is a Goddess!"

1658
01:41:38,958 --> 01:41:41,166
<i>"Goddess of fury!"</i>

1659
01:41:41,208 --> 01:41:45,625
<i>"She is the ruler of world."</i>

1660
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:49,583
- Mother!
- Sir, give some name to this operation.

1661
01:41:49,625 --> 01:41:51,708
Like 'Swatch Bharat' ,
let us name it 'Swatch Putra.'

1662
01:41:51,750 --> 01:41:52,583
It is nice, sir.

1663
01:41:52,625 --> 01:41:56,083
Get in, rascal! No student
should talk of strikes from now!

1664
01:41:58,208 --> 01:42:00,291
Sir, everything is clear.

1665
01:42:00,333 --> 01:42:01,583
Thanks, mother.

1666
01:42:02,416 --> 01:42:05,875
- Hello.
- How is the live telecast, brother GK?

1667
01:42:05,916 --> 01:42:07,833
You still have two days time.

1668
01:42:08,250 --> 01:42:09,416
All the best.

1669
01:42:23,791 --> 01:42:25,750
Brother, police has
hidden the eunuch somewhere.

1670
01:42:40,625 --> 01:42:42,125
No!

1671
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,416
<i>"He is totally mass!"</i>

1672
01:42:47,458 --> 01:42:49,833
<i>"He is total class!"</i>

1673
01:42:49,875 --> 01:42:54,375
<i>"He is the hope of box.
He is a cracker!"</i>

1674
01:42:54,666 --> 01:42:59,416
<i>"Look at this police!
He is a bursting cracker."</i>

1675
01:42:59,458 --> 01:43:04,166
<i>"He is the cracker that
ends up everything illegal!"</i>

1676
01:43:11,458 --> 01:43:12,291
Listen--

1677
01:43:12,333 --> 01:43:13,541
Brother-in-law, Bhanumathi
has uploaded a photo on face...

1678
01:43:13,583 --> 01:43:14,500
...and she says you didn't like it.

1679
01:43:14,541 --> 01:43:15,750
- She is scolding badly.
- Hey!

1680
01:43:15,791 --> 01:43:17,083
- Gk!
- Hail!

1681
01:43:17,125 --> 01:43:19,083
- Release GK's brother!
- Oh!

1682
01:43:19,458 --> 01:43:22,750
Henceforth 801... Challa brothers' 801.

1683
01:43:23,666 --> 01:43:25,916
Transfer like GVK 108.

1684
01:43:25,958 --> 01:43:27,250
Remove the tent.

1685
01:43:27,291 --> 01:43:29,333
- What if we don't remove it.
- Play the audio.

1686
01:43:34,583 --> 01:43:36,791
Fruit looks nice from outside.

1687
01:43:36,833 --> 01:43:39,083
There are insects inside
if you cut it and see.

1688
01:43:39,416 --> 01:43:41,750
Is this the glass in which you drank?

1689
01:43:42,666 --> 01:43:44,291
One man show in the entire city!

1690
01:43:44,333 --> 01:43:47,333
ACP Kalyan has become the
real hero for public and police.

1691
01:43:47,375 --> 01:43:50,750
ACP Kalyan has stood by girl
and has become a hero for public.

1692
01:43:50,791 --> 01:43:53,333
<i>"He is total mass."</i>

1693
01:43:53,375 --> 01:43:55,583
ACP Kalyan sir is really very great.

1694
01:43:55,625 --> 01:44:00,166
<i>"He is the hope of box.
He is a cracker."</i>

1695
01:44:00,208 --> 01:44:02,750
<i>- He has showed what police power is.
- "Look Police man."</i>

1696
01:44:02,791 --> 01:44:04,458
<i>"He is a bursting cracker."</i>

1697
01:44:04,500 --> 01:44:06,916
- GK should be removed from the post.
- GK should resign.

1698
01:44:06,958 --> 01:44:09,291
- We support Kalyan!
- We support Kalyan!

1699
01:44:15,125 --> 01:44:18,208
Brother-in-law,
they say Nani will be hanged for sure.

1700
01:44:18,250 --> 01:44:20,666
So if you transfer the properties
from his name to my name...

1701
01:44:20,708 --> 01:44:22,375
...you will be safe.
Registrar is online.

1702
01:44:22,416 --> 01:44:25,250
Entire body got injured
due to ACP's thrashing.

1703
01:44:25,291 --> 01:44:26,833
Don't pierce it with a needle!

1704
01:44:26,875 --> 01:44:30,416
Hello. Registrar sir,
my uncle is not interested.

1705
01:44:30,458 --> 01:44:32,500
- Get in touch after Nani dies.
- No!

1706
01:44:32,541 --> 01:44:35,666
My sister gave you
to me while she died so.

1707
01:44:35,708 --> 01:44:36,416
Uncle.

1708
01:44:36,458 --> 01:44:38,416
So I am sparing you without killing you.

1709
01:44:38,458 --> 01:44:40,958
- Uncle.
- Raja! GK Raja!

1710
01:44:41,250 --> 01:44:44,208
It is finished! Case has become public.

1711
01:44:44,500 --> 01:44:46,000
Situation went out of control.

1712
01:44:46,041 --> 01:44:48,083
If you can--

1713
01:44:48,125 --> 01:44:49,750
Chevipoku,
tell me so that I can understand.

1714
01:44:49,791 --> 01:44:53,000
Matter is known at the centre.
Your post is lost!

1715
01:44:54,583 --> 01:44:57,708
Did you come to tell this matter?
Disloyal dog!

1716
01:44:58,791 --> 01:45:00,166
No!

1717
01:45:00,666 --> 01:45:01,916
No!

1718
01:45:01,958 --> 01:45:03,791
Am I a disloyal dog?

1719
01:45:03,833 --> 01:45:08,041
Hey, brother Nani beat the
police and they have come home...

1720
01:45:08,083 --> 01:45:09,458
...so let us say sorry...
What did you say when I told this?

1721
01:45:09,500 --> 01:45:12,083
Will you humiliate me by calling me dog?
Anyway, I still tolerated it.

1722
01:45:12,125 --> 01:45:13,958
Our boy is harassing girls.

1723
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,750
...so I told you to warn him a bit.
You said it is okay.

1724
01:45:16,791 --> 01:45:18,750
You still humiliated me. I tolerated it.

1725
01:45:18,791 --> 01:45:21,708
Finally I said I will transfer the ACP.

1726
01:45:21,750 --> 01:45:22,875
You said not to do it.

1727
01:45:22,916 --> 01:45:24,041
You said he should be here
and you will play football.

1728
01:45:24,083 --> 01:45:26,708
Are you Olympic player to play football?

1729
01:45:26,750 --> 01:45:29,083
I will tell you Sumathi's poem.
Hear it, rascal!

1730
01:45:30,125 --> 01:45:32,541
14th page, 6th chapter.

1731
01:45:32,833 --> 01:45:36,375
3rd poem. A strong man
says he will not fear anything...

1732
01:45:36,416 --> 01:45:37,916
...and gets bitten...

1733
01:45:37,958 --> 01:45:40,541
...by ants and die.

1734
01:45:40,583 --> 01:45:42,750
He finally dies!
You will die the same death.

1735
01:45:43,458 --> 01:45:45,125
I used to drink...

1736
01:45:45,833 --> 01:45:47,958
...your leftover drinks.

1737
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
I still used to eat your leftover food.

1738
01:45:50,041 --> 01:45:52,708
Try to understand
and become good. Rascal!

1739
01:45:54,333 --> 01:45:56,458
Brother, we found the eunuch's address.

1740
01:46:00,750 --> 01:46:01,875
- Listen to me, Mahi.
- I will not listen.

1741
01:46:01,916 --> 01:46:04,000
I will tell your dad
today and fix our marriage.

1742
01:46:04,041 --> 01:46:06,000
- Why don't you wait for few more days?
- No possible.

1743
01:46:06,041 --> 01:46:07,375
Hello, girl.

1744
01:46:08,208 --> 01:46:10,333
- Hello, uncle.
- Come, dear.

1745
01:46:10,375 --> 01:46:11,541
You came at the correct time.

1746
01:46:11,583 --> 01:46:13,208
There is good breaking news. Watch it.

1747
01:46:13,250 --> 01:46:15,625
- What is it?
- I am planning to get my son married.

1748
01:46:16,166 --> 01:46:18,875
Nice decision. With whom, uncle?

1749
01:46:19,500 --> 01:46:20,791
Our Kashi's daughter.

1750
01:46:22,666 --> 01:46:23,333
I am not related to it.

1751
01:46:23,375 --> 01:46:24,500
What does your daughter-in-law do, sir?

1752
01:46:24,541 --> 01:46:26,083
Software job in America.

1753
01:46:26,125 --> 01:46:28,000
- Oh?
- Yes!

1754
01:46:28,041 --> 01:46:30,791
Mr. Raghu,
keep the camera in front of Kashi sir.

1755
01:46:32,333 --> 01:46:35,208
He is ruining the life of a reporter
for the sake of his own daughter--

1756
01:46:35,250 --> 01:46:36,583
Commissioner Kashi Vishwanath.

1757
01:46:36,625 --> 01:46:38,208
Commissioner joined
hands with SI Reddy and...

1758
01:46:38,250 --> 01:46:41,083
...is involved in liquor business,
drugs mafia, human trafficking...

1759
01:46:41,125 --> 01:46:43,125
- ...land grabbing--
- Hey, stop it.

1760
01:46:43,166 --> 01:46:45,291
Madam, don't spoil my career.

1761
01:46:45,333 --> 01:46:46,541
He said it for fun.

1762
01:46:47,541 --> 01:46:48,625
Yes?

1763
01:47:14,041 --> 01:47:17,208
<i>"Will you fix the bed,
I will give you Bandaru sweets?"</i>

1764
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:20,583
<i>"I will buy you sari and blouse,
will you come to the fields?"</i>

1765
01:47:20,875 --> 01:47:24,166
<i>"We are young, hot and enthusiastic."</i>

1766
01:47:24,208 --> 01:47:28,625
<i>"Let us love, oh my queen."</i>

1767
01:47:29,708 --> 01:47:33,041
<i>"Hey Rambha!"</i>

1768
01:47:33,083 --> 01:47:35,916
<i>"Rambo has come."</i>

1769
01:47:35,958 --> 01:47:39,375
<i>"I will not melt down like others."</i>

1770
01:47:39,416 --> 01:47:42,500
<i>"I will give you a slip
if you play tricks, rowdy SI."</i>

1771
01:47:42,833 --> 01:47:46,208
<i>"We are young, hot and enthusiastic.</i>

1772
01:47:46,250 --> 01:47:50,708
<i>"But still I will
not fall for you, dear."</i>

1773
01:47:51,625 --> 01:47:54,333
<i>'Hey, Samba."</i>

1774
01:47:55,041 --> 01:47:57,500
<i>"Rambhahas come."</i>

1775
01:48:25,083 --> 01:48:28,333
<i>"Oh smart girl!"</i>

1776
01:48:28,375 --> 01:48:31,541
<i>"Oh smart girl!"</i>

1777
01:48:31,875 --> 01:48:35,125
<i>"Don't provoke me, dear."</i>

1778
01:48:35,166 --> 01:48:38,541
<i>"I will shake, move..."</i>

1779
01:48:38,583 --> 01:48:42,166
<i>"...and rein you."</i>

1780
01:48:45,333 --> 01:48:48,541
<i>"Whatever you do..."</i>

1781
01:48:48,583 --> 01:48:52,041
<i>"...I will not be caught."</i>

1782
01:48:52,083 --> 01:48:55,416
<i>"Entire town will see..."</i>

1783
01:48:55,458 --> 01:48:58,833
<i>"...don't trap me."</i>

1784
01:48:58,875 --> 01:49:02,250
<i>"I will give you various gifts,
if you hug you if you fall in my arms."</i>

1785
01:49:02,291 --> 01:49:06,000
<i>"Listen to me and come, oh queen."</i>

1786
01:49:07,333 --> 01:49:11,291
<i>"This is the tribute to Balaiah!"</i>

1787
01:49:38,500 --> 01:49:41,833
<i>"By showing batons--"</i>

1788
01:49:41,875 --> 01:49:45,125
<i>"By showing batons..."</i>

1789
01:49:45,375 --> 01:49:48,625
<i>"...don't threaten me, oh hero."</i>

1790
01:49:48,666 --> 01:49:52,041
<i>"If you love..."</i>

1791
01:49:52,083 --> 01:49:55,791
<i>"...come to me sincerely."</i>

1792
01:49:59,125 --> 01:50:01,958
<i>"Colourful babe!"</i>

1793
01:50:02,250 --> 01:50:05,333
<i>"Let us find a place."</i>

1794
01:50:05,583 --> 01:50:08,958
<i>"Your love and my love."</i>

1795
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:12,333
<i>"Let us make it hot."</i>

1796
01:50:12,375 --> 01:50:15,750
<i>"There is sweet, spicy and sour."</i>

1797
01:50:15,791 --> 01:50:20,625
<i>"Why should we make it late?
Come, oh dear."</i>

1798
01:50:29,791 --> 01:50:32,125
Sir, I will present the witness in the
court by tomorrow morning 10 o'clock.

1799
01:50:32,166 --> 01:50:33,166
Good.

1800
01:50:47,500 --> 01:50:49,000
Sir!

1801
01:50:51,458 --> 01:50:52,958
Kalyan!

1802
01:50:53,208 --> 01:50:54,625
Hey! Mahi!

1803
01:50:55,166 --> 01:50:57,208
Sir!

1804
01:51:00,833 --> 01:51:02,833
You follow Mahi! I will go this side.

1805
01:51:32,166 --> 01:51:33,458
Mahi, are you okay?

1806
01:51:37,833 --> 01:51:40,250
Don't feel happy that
your girl friend is found.

1807
01:51:40,791 --> 01:51:44,458
I have kept you far away
from my coverage area wantonly.

1808
01:51:44,750 --> 01:51:45,916
It is a trap.

1809
01:51:46,666 --> 01:51:49,708
I too will get my brother
released on time...

1810
01:51:49,750 --> 01:51:51,750
...by breaking your hands  and legs.

1811
01:51:51,791 --> 01:51:54,125
The eunuch who is the
witness in this case...

1812
01:51:54,166 --> 01:51:57,583
...and your father who supports you...
I am killing them both.

1813
01:51:57,875 --> 01:52:00,666
- Hey!
- Hey, don't waste time.

1814
01:52:00,708 --> 01:52:02,625
Moreover you are at a long distance.

1815
01:52:02,666 --> 01:52:04,458
Come... come... come.

1816
01:52:05,708 --> 01:52:08,833
Hey, it seems dad too has come.

1817
01:52:09,083 --> 01:52:10,458
Come and collect the body.

1818
01:52:18,750 --> 01:52:20,083
Move!

1819
01:52:23,208 --> 01:52:26,166
Sir! Sir! Sir!

1820
01:52:26,708 --> 01:52:29,333
Sir! Sir!

1821
01:52:29,375 --> 01:52:31,000
Save me, sir!

1822
01:52:42,250 --> 01:52:44,125
- Sir!
- Sir!

1823
01:52:47,375 --> 01:52:49,458
Reddy, father is not taking the call.

1824
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:51,416
Trace his number and identify
the location urgently!

1825
01:52:58,583 --> 01:53:01,333
Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir!

1826
01:53:01,375 --> 01:53:02,750
Ramesh, don't shoot!

1827
01:53:03,083 --> 01:53:04,625
Sir!

1828
01:53:08,375 --> 01:53:09,958
Save me, sir!

1829
01:53:10,833 --> 01:53:12,958
Sir! Sir!

1830
01:53:20,083 --> 01:53:21,416
No!

1831
01:53:35,625 --> 01:53:37,666
Sir! Sir!

1832
01:53:38,375 --> 01:53:39,875
- Hey!
- Sir!

1833
01:53:45,666 --> 01:53:47,041
Sir!

1834
01:53:52,291 --> 01:53:53,541
Sir!

1835
01:53:59,125 --> 01:54:00,583
Sir!

1836
01:54:02,958 --> 01:54:04,166
Sir!

1837
01:54:11,166 --> 01:54:12,500
Sir!

1838
01:54:20,708 --> 01:54:23,125
Sincere police will get suspended...

1839
01:54:23,416 --> 01:54:24,875
...or die.

1840
01:54:25,833 --> 01:54:28,458
Your son too will join you in sometime.

1841
01:54:28,750 --> 01:54:30,125
Hey, mad.

1842
01:54:31,583 --> 01:54:36,291
My son is following law and order
and others rules because I am there.

1843
01:54:36,333 --> 01:54:39,583
The moment I don't exist,
he will break the rules.

1844
01:54:39,916 --> 01:54:41,125
He will...

1845
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:43,291
...kill you.

1846
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,208
You death in my son's hands...

1847
01:54:49,333 --> 01:54:51,250
...will be col.

1848
01:55:15,541 --> 01:55:17,708
Father... father.

1849
01:55:49,500 --> 01:55:52,458
As an Home Minister,
I would always tell DGP that...

1850
01:55:52,500 --> 01:55:55,708
...you are in the hit list of
terrorists, so be careful.

1851
01:55:55,750 --> 01:55:58,083
I will tell only one word on DGP.

1852
01:55:58,708 --> 01:56:02,583
All the deceased people are good.

1853
01:56:03,583 --> 01:56:04,791
Jai Hind!

1854
01:56:06,458 --> 01:56:09,125
As expected by everyone, GK's brother
and his friends are released on bail.

1855
01:56:09,166 --> 01:56:10,583
- Srujan! D6 news.
- Hail!

1856
01:56:10,625 --> 01:56:12,291
Nani!

1857
01:56:17,875 --> 01:56:20,250
Sir, the three accused in
Kavya's case got released bail.

1858
01:56:36,041 --> 01:56:37,958
Reddy, I think the train is on time.

1859
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,291
Sir, Falaknuma is late
by 15 minutes on this track.

1860
01:56:40,333 --> 01:56:42,250
Repalle passenger is
on right time on that track.

1861
01:56:42,291 --> 01:56:43,000
Shift to that track.

1862
01:56:43,041 --> 01:56:46,083
<i>"Train is coming.
Her style is wonderful."</i>

1863
01:56:46,333 --> 01:56:48,541
Sir! Passenger might apply brakes.

1864
01:56:48,583 --> 01:56:51,166
Yes, sir. Shatabdi and
non-stop don't have brakes there.

1865
01:56:51,208 --> 01:56:52,041
Shift!

1866
01:56:58,250 --> 01:57:00,125
Why do you shout like that
when train is coming? Come!

1867
01:57:11,708 --> 01:57:13,250
If you have TV nearby then turn it on.

1868
01:57:14,416 --> 01:57:16,500
GK's partner Ravi and his son...

1869
01:57:16,541 --> 01:57:19,500
...have died in a train
accident today morning.

1870
01:57:20,208 --> 01:57:22,250
While crossing the track for toilet...

1871
01:57:22,291 --> 01:57:24,125
...sources say they
had been hit by the train.

1872
01:57:25,041 --> 01:57:26,583
Only three hours.

1873
01:57:26,916 --> 01:57:28,333
You are finished.

1874
01:57:33,208 --> 01:57:34,333
Reddy, is the lorry ready?

1875
01:57:34,375 --> 01:57:35,916
Sir, even the garland is ready to put.

1876
01:57:35,958 --> 01:57:37,083
Leave me! Leave me!

1877
01:57:37,125 --> 01:57:38,333
Sit! Sit!

1878
01:57:57,791 --> 01:57:59,500
Now let us what the witness says. Come.

1879
01:58:02,541 --> 01:58:04,083
Did you see the accident live?

1880
01:58:04,125 --> 01:58:05,375
I saw it half an hour back.

1881
01:58:05,416 --> 01:58:06,375
How is it?

1882
01:58:06,416 --> 01:58:09,541
I have seen both father and
son drinking brandy on roadside hotel.

1883
01:58:09,791 --> 01:58:10,916
And then?

1884
01:58:10,958 --> 01:58:12,541
I don't drink more than a quarter.

1885
01:58:12,583 --> 01:58:14,416
Will you come on highway
by drinking full?

1886
01:58:14,458 --> 01:58:15,458
How dare you are!

1887
01:58:15,500 --> 01:58:16,625
Finally what do you say?

1888
01:58:16,666 --> 01:58:20,208
Public! Don't drink and drive!

1889
01:58:20,250 --> 01:58:21,708
Second wicket too is out!

1890
01:58:22,166 --> 01:58:23,458
How can he drink and drive?

1891
01:58:23,500 --> 01:58:24,750
He doesn't have the habit of drinking.

1892
01:58:24,791 --> 01:58:27,125
ACP is diverting the
topic with these killings.

1893
01:58:37,750 --> 01:58:39,708
Tamanna is coming!

1894
01:58:54,041 --> 01:58:55,666
Now you want to hear
from the witness, right?

1895
01:58:55,708 --> 01:58:56,541
Yes!

1896
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,583
- Sir, you are--
- MS Taman.

1897
01:59:01,625 --> 01:59:04,000
Taman is my fan. Public--

1898
01:59:04,250 --> 01:59:05,750
Nobody comes when asked to vote.

1899
01:59:05,791 --> 01:59:07,500
Will you come in huge
numbers when it is Tamanna?

1900
01:59:07,541 --> 01:59:09,708
What is this? Where are you going?

1901
01:59:10,166 --> 01:59:12,375
Look at him! He died in trampling.

1902
01:59:12,416 --> 01:59:13,791
Its paining.

1903
01:59:13,833 --> 01:59:15,708
From the bottom of my heart...

1904
01:59:15,750 --> 01:59:18,666
...begging...
let Tamanna's fans stay alive.

1905
01:59:18,708 --> 01:59:21,791
She is so sensitive.
Yes.

1906
01:59:22,166 --> 01:59:24,166
What is the mystery behind
these serial killings?

1907
01:59:24,208 --> 01:59:25,958
Sir, not only the police...

1908
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:27,416
...maoists kill politicians too.

1909
01:59:27,458 --> 01:59:29,875
Logic! Press people have come.
What should I tell them?

1910
01:59:29,916 --> 01:59:32,541
You know it very well.
All the deceased are good.

1911
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:34,541
People who are alive,
are sweet memories of deceased people.

1912
01:59:34,583 --> 01:59:36,416
Hope you don't put
me in those sweet memories.

1913
01:59:36,458 --> 01:59:38,375
It depends on your performance.

1914
01:59:38,416 --> 01:59:39,916
I will perform very well!

1915
01:59:40,291 --> 01:59:43,125
Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir!

1916
01:59:46,625 --> 01:59:49,666
What is this? Are you journalists?

1917
01:59:49,916 --> 01:59:52,625
Let anything happen to our
face but news is important to you.

1918
01:59:52,666 --> 01:59:53,666
Ask me!

1919
01:59:53,708 --> 01:59:55,750
They are saying police
is behind these sequel murders.

1920
01:59:55,791 --> 01:59:57,416
These are natural deaths.

1921
01:59:57,458 --> 01:59:58,666
So do you support them?

1922
01:59:58,708 --> 01:59:59,875
Are you trying to hide the truth?

1923
01:59:59,916 --> 02:00:01,458
Are you afraid of the pressure?

1924
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:04,458
Media friends...

1925
02:00:04,500 --> 02:00:06,833
...whenever I undergo
frustration these days...

1926
02:00:06,875 --> 02:00:09,083
...I am using an item for mental peace.

1927
02:00:09,125 --> 02:00:11,000
Entire state knows it.

1928
02:00:11,375 --> 02:00:12,625
- Do you know?
- What is it, sir?

1929
02:00:12,666 --> 02:00:14,250
- What is it, sir?
- What is it, sir?

1930
02:00:14,291 --> 02:00:17,500
Jai... thanks for your pepper spray.

1931
02:00:21,791 --> 02:00:25,000
Hey, ACP! I know I am your next target.

1932
02:00:25,416 --> 02:00:27,250
Everyone related to Kavya's case...

1933
02:00:27,291 --> 02:00:29,708
...is dying one after
another so I have...

1934
02:00:29,750 --> 02:00:31,750
...brought high security
from government.

1935
02:00:34,375 --> 02:00:36,958
Security officer
too is sincere like you.

1936
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:38,625
Cop who doesn't comprise.

1937
02:00:38,666 --> 02:00:40,708
I will be in Delhi in next hour.

1938
02:00:40,750 --> 02:00:42,958
I will return with
the power that I lost.

1939
02:00:43,250 --> 02:00:44,875
I will teach you a lesson!

1940
02:00:44,916 --> 02:00:46,958
- At what time is the flight?
- 10 o'clock.

1941
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:48,416
- Uncle--
- My words... hey!

1942
02:00:48,458 --> 02:00:51,125
Do you want to trace
my location by making me talk?

1943
02:00:51,458 --> 02:00:54,333
Oh... I think airport too has come.

1944
02:01:08,375 --> 02:01:11,458
Nani and I kept telling you
that route is changed. Did you listen?

1945
02:01:11,500 --> 02:01:13,000
Cop who doesn't compromise.

1946
02:01:13,041 --> 02:01:14,791
You followed the profile very well.

1947
02:01:14,833 --> 02:01:16,250
Have you seen the photo?

1948
02:01:16,708 --> 02:01:18,333
See there once.

1949
02:01:22,916 --> 02:01:24,458
I hate police!

1950
02:01:31,583 --> 02:01:32,708
For your security...

1951
02:01:32,750 --> 02:01:35,083
...there was a bumper offer
in the department yesterday.

1952
02:01:35,125 --> 02:01:37,125
Everyone got ready...

1953
02:01:37,166 --> 02:01:39,375
...but I won the lottery.

1954
02:01:42,958 --> 02:01:44,916
I am in my safety.

1955
02:01:44,958 --> 02:01:46,291
What is your--

1956
02:01:47,333 --> 02:01:49,458
Our blood has one bad habit.

1957
02:01:49,500 --> 02:01:53,125
Whoever the person might be in front
of us, we just confront him directly.

1958
02:01:53,166 --> 02:01:55,875
Eye to eye! Face to face!

1959
02:01:56,541 --> 02:01:58,625
We don't backstab like you.

1960
02:01:59,083 --> 02:02:01,500
Your brothers’ deaths are decided.

1961
02:03:47,041 --> 02:03:48,208
Hey! Hey!

1962
02:04:00,125 --> 02:04:01,333
Hey!

1963
02:04:15,708 --> 02:04:16,750
- Hi!
- You--

1964
02:04:16,791 --> 02:04:18,291
Tsunami star Subash!

1965
02:04:19,083 --> 02:04:20,916
I am the witness to your death too.

1966
02:04:20,958 --> 02:04:24,083
- I will not spare you.
- Hi, you are crying.

1967
02:04:24,583 --> 02:04:28,291
Sir, once I want to
hear him say I love police.

1968
02:04:28,541 --> 02:04:30,125
Not just once...

1969
02:04:30,166 --> 02:04:33,166
...I will say it hundred times.
I love police! I love police!

1970
02:04:33,208 --> 02:04:35,791
But I hate criminals. Aim the guns!

1971
02:04:36,708 --> 02:04:38,500
Fire!

1972
02:04:42,541 --> 02:04:44,666
Eye witness is next to us.
There--

1973
02:04:45,333 --> 02:04:46,666
Who are you, sir?

1974
02:04:47,083 --> 02:04:48,333
Vish!

1975
02:04:49,625 --> 02:04:51,083
Oh! Tsunami star? You?

1976
02:04:51,125 --> 02:04:52,791
What happened to this city?

1977
02:04:52,833 --> 02:04:56,291
On one hand there is river
Musi and on the other hand it is smoke.

1978
02:04:57,500 --> 02:04:59,833
We cannot avoid paying heavy penalty.

1979
02:04:59,875 --> 02:05:01,500
Movies have become less,
so he came to ads.

1980
02:05:01,541 --> 02:05:03,541
- He has become old.
- Shut up!

1981
02:05:04,041 --> 02:05:06,583
I started like that
for content connectivity.

1982
02:05:06,625 --> 02:05:09,041
I came here because the
climax location is tempting.

1983
02:05:09,541 --> 02:05:12,250
By then Gk came here
to hide these mills.

1984
02:05:12,750 --> 02:05:14,583
He said hi and offered a cigarette.

1985
02:05:14,625 --> 02:05:16,583
I said I don't have the
habit and told him to get out.

1986
02:05:16,958 --> 02:05:19,166
He got fired when I looked at him.

1987
02:05:19,208 --> 02:05:22,000
You will die in installments
if you smoke at smoking zone.

1988
02:05:22,291 --> 02:05:25,083
If you smoke at no smoking
zones then you will die instantly.

1989
02:05:25,333 --> 02:05:27,583
Public!
Please have awareness!

1990
02:05:27,625 --> 02:05:28,791
In how many getups should I say?

1991
02:05:28,833 --> 02:05:30,208
- Sir--
- I know.

1992
02:05:30,250 --> 02:05:31,416
To how many people should I say?

1993
02:05:31,458 --> 02:05:32,958
Will you not listen?
Will you not change?

1994
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:34,500
Hello! Wait.

1995
02:05:34,541 --> 02:05:36,625
- There is a small information.
- Two states.

1996
02:05:36,666 --> 02:05:38,625
Two 801. Two Chandras.

1997
02:05:38,666 --> 02:05:39,666
They are telling to implement.

1998
02:05:39,708 --> 02:05:40,875
There is a toll free number too.

1999
02:05:40,916 --> 02:05:43,250
www.beatbeat.com.

2000
02:05:43,291 --> 02:05:44,750
Audio is very powerful than video here.

2001
02:05:46,666 --> 02:05:48,750
Prawn and Crab production! Missile!

2002
02:05:49,083 --> 02:05:50,500
Ready to launch! Opening shot!

2003
02:05:52,208 --> 02:05:54,000
Police means power!

2004
02:05:54,666 --> 02:05:56,875
Police means arrogance!

2005
02:05:56,916 --> 02:05:58,875
Police means fear!

2006
02:06:00,750 --> 02:06:02,041
This is not enough.

2007
02:06:02,083 --> 02:06:03,958
Very good. Very good. Congrats, sir.

2008
02:06:04,791 --> 02:06:06,125
Why are you not clapping?

2009
02:06:06,166 --> 02:06:07,291
Sir, why do you play police
at the age if dying?

2010
02:06:07,333 --> 02:06:08,250
Shut up!

2011
02:06:08,500 --> 02:06:10,625
You wondered when Rajini
did 'Robo' at this age.

2012
02:06:10,666 --> 02:06:11,791
So will you not watch
Subash's 'Missile'?

2013
02:06:11,833 --> 02:06:13,333
- How can you compare with him?
- Pack up!

2014
02:06:13,875 --> 02:06:16,166
- Which forest is it?
- Chattisgarh.

2015
02:06:16,458 --> 02:06:18,291
As if you didn't find
any minister in the country...

2016
02:06:18,333 --> 02:06:20,125
...you have kidnapped only me.

2017
02:06:20,166 --> 02:06:21,916
Call the Prime Minister and tell him...

2018
02:06:21,958 --> 02:06:24,791
...to change my port folio.
Tell it is the demand of kidnappers.

2019
02:06:24,833 --> 02:06:26,416
- Whom are you calling?
- Home Minister.

2020
02:06:26,458 --> 02:06:28,541
Rascal! The person who saved us...

2021
02:06:28,583 --> 02:06:29,750
...call him.

2022
02:06:29,791 --> 02:06:31,833
Even if we get kidnapped
in South African forests...

2023
02:06:31,875 --> 02:06:33,666
...he should come and save us.

2024
02:06:34,125 --> 04:13:07,791
Cut it!
