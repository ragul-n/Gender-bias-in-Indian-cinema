It's my home.

8
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:19,524
You have come back home or
is there some other reason?

9
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,491
Did not get your visa renewed?

10
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:30,999
And why would you do so, after all only doctors
and engineers are making nation proud.

11
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:45,616
Check again.
Excuse me Sir, is there some problem?

12
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:51,624
Sir, I am getting late, my family
must be walting outside.

Sir, i am no thief, smuggler or terrorist.

17
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:09,771
It's never written on the face of a terrorist,
checking has to be done.

18
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,710
I understand sir, but i amjust a simple man

19
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:17,511
Doctor sir, every body seems
simple until something happens.

20
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:22,386
I amjust giving an example,
you do yourjob and let us do ours.

21
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,559
Had Amar been my name, would you
still have done so much of checking?

22
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:30,257
Sir, he is clear.

23
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:40,738

00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:44,221
I am not in the habit of talking to the wrong person.

27
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:51,562
Look sir, i am talking to you.
Your luggage has been placed.

28
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:55,866
Seat yourself quickly, the driver is a bit crazy.

29
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,567
What kind ofjoke is this?

30
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:13,849
My luggage is in it.

31
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:20,223
My luggage is in it.

00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:37,132
Hey, somebody stop him, my luggage is init.

00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,528
What kind ofjoke is this?
Lts annoying.

35
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:06,928
I am doing whatever i have been told to do,
and you also do whatever you are being told to do.

36
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:31,324
Didn't i tell you he was crazy?

37
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:34,433
Look my friend, who ever you are...

38
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:38,369
Here in our community we talk
to our elders with respect.

39
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:47,474
Look big brother, i am sorry.
But who ever you are, you have got the wrong person.

40
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:51,339
Neither of us know each other.

41
00:10:54,353 --> 00:11:01,816
Aamir Ali, father's name Rashid Ali and mother's name
Tarannum Ali. Father died three years back.

Should i tell more, about your aunt in Kanpur?

45
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:32,983
Who are you?
That's not important.

46
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:36,393
What do you want from me?
Keep sitting quietly inside the taxi.

47
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:55,837
Don't make calls, it won't work.

48
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:03,549

00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:14,630
Look friend, you stop the taxi and extract
my luggage, i have to go home.

50
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:18,435
I am telling you to stop the taxi.

51
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:34,616
Hey, what are you doing?

52
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:45,496
Somebody stop him.

53
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:36,666
Didn't i tell you to sit quietly inside the taxi?
What do you want?

54
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:46,616
That taxi guy ran away with my luggage. It contalns my
things, my passport, my asthma medications.

55
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:51,717
Look sir, please. Its enough now.
I have to go home now.

56
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:55,293
You made a call at your home, did anyone pick?

57
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,492
What do you mean?
Nobody is at your home.

58
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:04,295

Where is my family?
Right here.

60

It's up to you.
You have five hours to save them.

You want money, tell me how much?

101
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:55,458
So much that it's beyond your means.

102
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:58,967
Then what do you want?

103
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:07,676
Have you ever thought about your people,
about your brothers and sisters, of your community?

104
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:11,672
I don't understand what you are saying.

105
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:17,614
You never thought, that's why.
Try thinking and you'll understand everything.

106
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:26,630
Brother, can i have a glass of water?

107
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:34,938
No.

00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,386
You are hungry?
No, i am thirsty.

109
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:50,752
You must be hungry.
Didn't i tell you i am thirsty.

110
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:07,839
Move out, there is a shop there.
You can find good dates there...

111
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,375
Didn't you hear?

112
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:34,897
How much?

113
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:46,477
Eat some and put some in the pocket.
Provides energy to the body.

114
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:55,719
When ever Mughals went for war,
they survived on this for several days.

115
00:25:58,523 --> 00:25:59,820
You did not observe the date?

116
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:08,663
You did not eat?

117
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:30,744
Go stralght, take the second street. There is a Gulistan
building there, there is a toilet on second floor.

118
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:33,224
I have left a numberfor you there.

119
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:37,820
Why don't you tell me stralght away where exactly
i have to go, i am doing what you say.

120
00:27:01,586 --> 00:27:06,353
Brother, where is this Gulistan buliding.
It's right here.

121
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:21,191
Son, where is the bathroom?

122
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:27,600
Where is the toilet.
There at the backside.

123
00:30:39,804 --> 00:30:43,001
Did you see, what terrible lives our people are living?

124
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:48,237
They don't even have place for toilet,
how will they provide place to live?

125
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:53,084
I want to talk to my family.
Get out of there.

126
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:54,452
First i want to talk to my family.

127
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:59,048
Do as i say or none of you will survive to talk or listen.

128
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:03,853
Didn't you hear me?

129
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:09,334
It's been sixty years since independence.

130
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:14,738
The world scaled new heights but our people
are still there where they used to be.

131
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:17,639
First, be slaves to the English and now, their.

132
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:19,811
Who has prevented?
What did you say?

133
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:23,872
Who has prevented someone from doing something?
Nobody prevented me.

134
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:29,346
You did because you got everything.
Your luck was favorable.

135
00:31:29,754 --> 00:31:30,743
What about others?

136
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:38,896
Look Sir, if you think that i got everything, then you are
wrong. I did because i wanted to.

137
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:41,855
I did my studies from government school and
government college.

138
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:45,266
Worked hard and passed the exams, went abroad on
scholarship.

139
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:50,598
Whatever i have earned is because of my hard work.
I did because this was what i wanted.

140
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:56,012
I have sculpted my own destiny. And not only me,
thousands of others have sculpted their own destinies.

141
00:31:57,482 --> 00:31:58,710
Aman sculpts his destiny on his own.

142
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,714
Who says a man sculpts his own destiny?
It's all rubbish.

143
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:05,316
If only you had the right tutelage,
your thoughts wouldn't be so futile.

144
00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:08,524
You think like that and not me.
Really?

145
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:14,855
And who is writing your destiny now?
Why did you stop?

146
00:32:18,736 --> 00:32:21,762
You'll com across a gate, cross over.

147
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:41,684
Shabnam Communication Centre, can you see it?

148
00:32:50,468 --> 00:33:01,276
Sister Shabnam must be sitting there, show him the
number. Whoever responds on that number tell him

149
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,940
Son, go outSide and mind the shop.

150
00:33:40,551 --> 00:33:43,384
This number belongs to which place?
Don't you know?

151
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:49,926
Here, talk, its from Karachi.

152
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:13,180
At least do something yourself, after all i am
a human child and not your commando.

153
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:17,480
Where are you calling from?

154
00:34:19,957 --> 00:34:21,822

155
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,756

00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:45,751

162
00:38:46,557 --> 00:38:49,720

165
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:04,834
Why did he run after me?

166
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:11,612
You think yourself why did that policeman run after
you? What did you do, huh?

167
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:14,743
You look like a simple, educated
and from a good family.

168
00:39:18,222 --> 00:39:22,522
And so you are, what did you do?

169
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:27,264
You made one call to
Karachi and that policemanran after you

170
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:29,391
as if you belonged to that place and not this place.

171
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:31,825
Look, don't twist things.

172
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:34,533
I am elucidating you.

173
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:38,334
Elucidating me, I am asking you
something and you are going astray.

174
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:45,244
Aren't you missing your family, huh?

175
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:55,349
Reach hotel qulckly, what number did he tell you?

176
00:39:56,427 --> 00:39:57,860
Don't you know?
No.

177
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:18,304
How well he sings!
It's the miracle of "cap".

178
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:22,345
The cap sales have soared all over the market.

179
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,993
What is wrong sir, some kind of tenSion?

180
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:30,824
Someone has kidnapped my family members.

181
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:34,923
Can you help releaSing them, no?
Then drive the car.

182
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:52,648
I got it Sir, you were kidding, right?
It happens, sir.

183
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:56,945
Aperson say things in fit of anger, never mind.

184
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:57,380
Want a rider, for the night?

185
00:41:58,782 --> 00:42:00,579
Will provide an expert service.

186
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:26,468
Listen, If you want to try something new, will be
charged extra.

187
00:42:44,828 --> 00:42:50,789
When the two sisters reached the street square, those
two scoundrel boys were standing there walting for her.

188
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:56,732
One of them made vulgar remarks to Rani.

189
00:42:59,376 --> 00:43:02,174
Then... Rani was accustomed to such remarks.

190
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:06,178
Yes, but Preeti, she heard all this for the first time.

191
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:07,382
She started crying.

192
00:43:08,385 --> 00:43:11,980
Excuse me.
I am listening, you go on.

193
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:13,979
Preeti cried thioughout the way.

194
00:43:14,725 --> 00:43:18,462
When both the sisters reached home then Rani asked
Preeti angrily, tell me something,

195
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:24,423
those scoundrels told everything to me but why have
you been crying thioughout the way?

196
00:43:25,803 --> 00:43:32,572
Then Preeti sald, sister, even i want to be a big girl... i
want to be a big girl,

197
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,757
Where is room number 203?

198
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:58,029
Come.

199
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:13,708
Take him along.

200
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:38,235
This is the bed, Sit down.
Here is water, you were thirsty.

201
00:44:44,048 --> 00:44:46,573
What do you people want from me?

202
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:54,781
Pick it up, can't you hear?

203
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:13,973
Aman will come, go with him.

204
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:19,747
I am not going anywhere.
Until you tell me what you want from me?

205
00:45:20,684 --> 00:45:24,922
He'll ask you the number, tell him.
You remember it?

206
00:45:24,922 --> 00:45:28,992
I sald i am not going anywhere unless you tell me...

207
00:45:28,992 --> 00:45:33,986
I am telling you and also showing you
and also elucidating, but you don't grasp.

208
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:37,758
Look agaln.

209
00:45:38,268 --> 00:45:39,394
Yourmom is thinking of you.

210
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:44,703
What should i tell her, huh?

211
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:51,642
She is dying to meet you. She keeps asking repeatedly,
when will my Aamir come, when?

212
00:45:52,649 --> 00:45:58,781
Should i tell her that you don't care for her at all?

213
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:02,690
You are hardly concerned about her life and death.

214
00:46:13,337 --> 00:46:14,371
Please, you...

215
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:15,167
Hey, listen...

216
00:46:23,213 --> 00:46:23,975
Go quietly.

217
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:12,516
Are you crippled or has paralysis hit you?
Come along.

218
00:48:17,494 --> 00:48:23,296
Yes, come comfortably.
Never ever seen before that you are gaping around?

219
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:27,295
Hey Firoz bro, how come you lost your way here today?

220
00:48:27,771 --> 00:48:30,706
I didn't lose my way you rascal, but found it.

221
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:35,107
And you, remember this path.
Move quickly.

222
00:48:56,233 --> 00:48:57,200
Khan sir?

223
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:09,445
This is the same guy.
He even recited the right number.

224
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:26,845
What is this?

225
00:50:28,658 --> 00:50:30,489
What do you think?

226
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:46,774
Abomb!

227
00:50:59,956 --> 00:51:01,981
Give the chit to the person whom you give the bag.

228
00:51:05,962 --> 00:51:09,261
Move out from here and walt
inside the room, a phone call will come.

229
00:51:18,975 --> 00:51:21,466
What, what are you looking at?

230
00:51:23,346 --> 00:51:26,907
It's time to get away, you remember the way?

231
00:51:30,887 --> 00:51:32,787
The goat is fresh brother.

232
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:48,584
Is it too heavy?

233
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:53,921
Should i make it lighter?
Hey hero!

234
00:58:09,352 --> 00:58:11,616
What did you think, that it was really a bomb, huh?

235
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:15,487
You are in the habit of asking too many questions?

236
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:19,724
Won't you ask whose money is it,
from where did it come?

237
00:58:21,231 --> 00:58:22,289
I'll tell you.

238
00:58:23,433 --> 00:58:24,525
It's of the community.

239
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:30,602
Our brothers have send it from all over
the world, for the purpose of war.

240
00:58:43,987 --> 00:58:45,545
Have you ever sent money?

241
00:58:50,727 --> 00:58:52,217
What have you taped your mouth?

242
00:58:54,397 --> 00:59:00,632
Look, please. I did whatever you sald.
For how long, i have to go home now.

243
00:59:06,409 --> 00:59:15,716
Do one lastjob and then both you and your family are
free. Before that, i am sending food.

244
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:20,216
You must be hungry, have it.
I don't want to eat.

245
00:59:21,791 --> 00:59:25,921
You'll eat and only then will i send food for your family,
they must be hungry.

246
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:32,791
There it is, eat soon.

247
01:01:01,858 --> 01:01:03,917
Draw out all the papers and put on the table.

248
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:08,490
Put the suitcase one in pocket and the key too.

249
01:01:18,307 --> 01:01:20,434
Give away the suitcase and yourjob is over.

250
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:06,379
Hey you hero, you are leaving, you'll regret.

251
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:30,475
From the right, the first narrow street.
Can you see?

252
01:02:34,884 --> 01:02:41,016
The street will lead to ajunction outside.
There is a bus stop, reach over there.

253
01:02:41,724 --> 01:02:43,453
I'll call you agaln sharp at four o'clock.

254
01:02:46,462 --> 01:02:50,262
And listen, don't ask anything from anyone.

255
01:07:45,461 --> 01:07:49,329
Brother, that man... please stop him.

256
01:07:51,233 --> 01:07:52,666
He ran with my suitcase.

257
01:08:10,186 --> 01:08:11,483
What happened to him?

258
01:08:53,929 --> 01:09:00,528
He will not spare... will not spare my family members.

259
01:10:26,322 --> 01:10:28,790
Are you day dreaming?

260
01:10:51,714 --> 01:10:56,344
Brother, did you see somebody carry a red bag?
No, i did not.

261
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:03,547
Brother, you saw anybody carry a red bag?
No.

262
01:11:47,603 --> 01:11:48,501
Hey hero.
Looking for red box?

263
01:11:58,947 --> 01:12:01,381
I want money.
How do you know?

264
01:12:03,218 --> 01:12:07,416
I am a woman about town and I keep track of things.

265
01:12:08,891 --> 01:12:14,830
Where is it, please?
I told you... money.

266
01:12:24,606 --> 01:12:29,270
Take this.
Keep it but please, fast, please.

267
01:12:38,687 --> 01:12:42,748
This place is like that.
Nobody comes with small bags.

268
01:12:43,892 --> 01:12:47,658
And you were moving with a big box, what did it
contaln?

269
01:12:53,435 --> 01:12:56,427
Don't tell, it doesn't matter to me.

270
01:13:02,745 --> 01:13:12,211
What was inside the box, tell me.
Don't speak, i don't care.

271
01:13:25,667 --> 01:13:32,732
This is theirjob. Just a few days back they were out of
the jall and they started agaln.

272
01:13:35,043 --> 01:13:39,980
Where are you going?
You want him or the box?

273
01:13:44,586 --> 01:13:52,857
There is a beetle shop, they sit in the room nearby.
How do you know?

274
01:13:55,464 --> 01:13:57,659
I have been there a lot of times.

275
01:14:04,773 --> 01:14:11,736
How will you go back if you give everything to me?
Where do you have to go?

276
01:14:24,693 --> 01:14:28,527
Have you seen your face?
Wipe it.

277
01:14:47,049 --> 01:14:51,543
You seem to be a nice man, what happened with you?

278
01:18:56,364 --> 01:19:02,269
Reached? Bus number 84, will be there in fifteen
minutes, mount it.

279
01:19:08,844 --> 01:19:14,646
I made you experience so many things, did you
understand?

280
01:19:18,386 --> 01:19:24,882
Yourname is Aamir, isn't it?
You know what Aamirmeans? Leader.

281
01:19:26,661 --> 01:19:31,967
Aman who does something for himself,
for his community, what did you do?

282
01:19:31,967 --> 01:19:35,637
I want to become no leader.
I am but a simple man.

283
01:19:35,637 --> 01:19:37,867
A simple man only brings about revolution.

284
01:19:39,307 --> 01:19:42,911
I want to bring no revolution,
all i want is to live my life.

285
01:19:42,911 --> 01:19:45,744
If every man thinks like you
what will become of the community?

286
01:19:45,881 --> 01:19:49,749
If every man thinks about himself, then every
community will be blessed.

287
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:58,249
By going abroad, have you forgotten about your fight,
about your community.

288
01:19:58,894 --> 01:20:01,226
I don't want to fight any battle.
Is this not your battle?

289
01:20:01,830 --> 01:20:03,695
Aren't you a Muslim?
Yes, i am.

290
01:20:04,232 --> 01:20:08,370
You are not a Muslim.
No, you are no Muslim.

291
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:13,842
Who are you to say so? Because it's every Muslim's
obligation to participate in war.

292
01:20:13,842 --> 01:20:14,672
I don't agree.

293
01:20:14,976 --> 01:20:21,483
Didn't you see for yourself, inSide the suitcase. How our
brother from foreign lands are helping us?

294
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:26,721
Nobody is helping anybody. It's always the near one's
that help.

295
01:20:26,721 --> 01:20:27,556
You know more than me?

296
01:20:27,556 --> 01:20:30,753
At least i know that.
And you know too.

297
01:20:30,959 --> 01:20:32,256
You will not understand, let it be.

298
01:20:33,295 --> 01:20:36,287
If you did not grasp after observing all the things, then
how will you understand now.

299
01:20:39,634 --> 01:20:41,465
Bus must be arriving, mount it.

300
01:20:42,537 --> 01:20:48,703
Drop inAndheri station. There you'll find a taxi guy.
Give him the sultcase, yourjob is over.

301
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:54,509
And my family?

302
01:20:57,519 --> 01:21:00,283
I'll let them go as soon as the job is done.

303
01:22:31,046 --> 01:22:33,640
Push the sultcase under the seat and get off.

304
01:22:37,552 --> 01:22:40,919
Push the sultcase under the seat and get off.

305
01:23:25,567 --> 01:23:30,869
Sultcase... you changed the suitcase?
To change the destiny of the community.

306
01:23:31,706 --> 01:23:36,336
Now you know why does a simple man fight?

307
01:23:36,878 --> 01:23:44,019
To get back whatever was snatched away.
You knew everything, right?

308
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:47,216
We know everything, its only you who doesn't know.

309
01:23:48,823 --> 01:23:50,518
Why are you making me do all this?

310
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:55,656
You should have done this, there. But you ran away.

311
01:23:57,632 --> 01:24:00,829
You lost London and if you stay Silent, then you'll lose
Mumbal too.

312
01:24:02,904 --> 01:24:05,270
It's not right.
It'sjust an act of retaliation.

313
01:24:08,476 --> 01:24:13,880
Get off, you have thiee minutes. And then you will be a
patriot and your family members, free.

314
01:24:35,437 --> 01:24:38,804
Get off, only two and a half minutes remaln.

315
01:24:53,521 --> 01:24:54,647
Didn't you hear?

316
01:25:31,025 --> 01:25:33,323
Now you have become "Aamir".

317
01:28:37,879 --> 01:28:43,875
Congratulations brother, he got off.
Don't disconnect the phone, i must hear the sound.

318
01:30:37,732 --> 01:30:38,926
Brother.
What happened?

319
01:32:33,848 --> 01:32:38,217
We just got a breaking news.
Ablast took place in Mumbal's residential area.

320
01:32:38,786 --> 01:32:42,347
You heard it right, blast in a residential area.

321
01:32:50,965 --> 01:32:53,901
A terrorist got killed.
You heard it right, a terrorist got killed.

322
01:32:53,901 --> 01:32:56,870
But no information about his links to any organization.

323
01:33:01,375 --> 01:33:05,746
You are watching first fresh pictures of the bomb blast
on our channel.

324
01:33:05,746 --> 01:33:10,149
We have no information as to why did that terrorist run
with the suitcase.

325
01:33:10,284 --> 01:33:14,584
But had the bomb exploded inside the bus, at least
hundred people would have been killed.

326
01:33:27,735 --> 01:33:34,971
Can you hear us, Rahul... Rahul? We lost contact but all
those who havejust switched there television
